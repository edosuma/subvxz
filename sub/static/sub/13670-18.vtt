00:01.400 --> 00:02.920
Previously on St Elsewhere.

00:02.920 --> 00:04.240
# Dancin' in the street! #

00:04.240 --> 00:06.520
St Eligius' 50th anniversary party.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.400
The founder and chief administrator

00:08.400 --> 00:12.200
of St Eligius Hospital,
Father Joseph McCabe.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.520
     I don't like you, McCabe.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.239
  You're a smoothie from Southie.

00:16.239 --> 00:19.920
And you're a petty bureaucrat
who uses the power of
  the Catholic Church

00:19.920 --> 00:21.600
as if Jesus Christ was your idea.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.720
When did you arrive at St Eligius?

00:23.720 --> 00:25.120
1965.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.600
Excuse me, chaps.
I'm reporting for work.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.160
Tell me about when you were
named Director of Medicine.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.880
Tell me about when you were
named Director of Medicine.
That was 1975.

00:31.880 --> 00:32.840
That's my wife.

00:32.840 --> 00:36.360
That's my wife.
If it's her time,
you've got to let her go.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.560
Breathe, sweetheart.

00:37.560 --> 00:38.600
Won't you hop on to the bed?

00:38.600 --> 00:39.920
Won't you hop on to the bed?
I can't move my legs.

00:39.920 --> 00:43.040
The O'Caseys never had
much to pass on except hope.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.640
And a family name.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.920
Now that's going to stop
with our son Kevin.

00:46.920 --> 00:47.960
Why?

00:47.960 --> 00:49.040
He's homosexual.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.480
I came by cos I'm concerned.

00:50.480 --> 00:53.160
All right, you're concerned.  Fine.

00:53.160 --> 00:57.160
What are you doing with my son?
Pete! Where are you going? Pete!

02:24.520 --> 02:27.760
What's the use of plain by the rules
if you're never going to win?

02:27.760 --> 02:30.600
Donny, winning isn't
the only thing that counts.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.840
We all have to play by the rules,
otherwise everybody loses.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.920
George Deayton cheats at marbles.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.160
             He does?

02:37.160 --> 02:41.160
Today, plus a swirly, two aggies!

02:42.840 --> 02:44.600
And my favourite shooter!

02:44.600 --> 02:47.840
Listen, son, there's no real
satisfaction unless we play fair

02:47.840 --> 02:51.360
and square and do our best all
the time. Why don't you challenge him

02:51.360 --> 02:53.720
to another game tomorrow?
Maybe you'll win.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.520
Or lose all my marbles.

02:55.520 --> 02:56.440
                       Father McCabe!

02:56.440 --> 02:57.680
                       Father McCabe!
How are you, my friend?

02:57.680 --> 03:00.440
Fine. My wife and I really enjoyed
the sermon Sunday.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.880
The parish will miss you.
When are you leaving?

03:02.880 --> 03:05.440
Well, running this
house of God's a full-time job.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.320
But I'll be close by if you need me.

03:07.320 --> 03:11.320
Hello, Donny. Is the snow
still good for packing, lad?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.240
Quite a hospital
you've built, father.

03:14.240 --> 03:17.360
Well, it's God's design, for sure.
But since he never went to

03:17.360 --> 03:20.120
architecture school, I had to
draw up the blueprints.

03:20.120 --> 03:24.120
Let's see you hit Flannery's pub
    across the street.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.640
Got it!

03:29.640 --> 03:33.640
Help, help, Father! Help!
This guy's hurt real bad, Father.

03:38.600 --> 03:42.600
Please don't let me die!

04:13.240 --> 04:17.240
We was moving a milling machine when
it fell over. Killed another fella.

04:17.399 --> 04:20.120
     Get me 15cc of cocaine solution,

04:20.120 --> 04:21.880
         cotton sutures and a needle.

04:21.880 --> 04:24.400
He's lost a lot of blood.
We'll hold him down.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.720
        It might be pretty painful. &gt;

04:25.720 --> 04:28.680
Patrick's Catholic, Father.
Could you say something?

04:28.680 --> 04:32.680
Just in case? &gt;

04:35.400 --> 04:39.400
(GIVES BLESSING IN LATIN)

05:02.680 --> 05:03.720
                                Jack.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.400
What?  I'm sorry.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.880
What? Did the police call
with some news about my son?

05:09.880 --> 05:12.840
                Pete's still missing.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.760
It's my fault he's been kidnapped.

05:15.760 --> 05:19.760
I should have pushed harder for a
daycare centre here at the hospital.

05:22.480 --> 05:26.480
Instead of passing Pete around...

05:26.760 --> 05:28.400
..for anybody to play with him.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.960
&lt; Assuming everybody
would be nice to him.

05:30.960 --> 05:34.960
I was out all night looking
for my son, going door to door.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.680
Handing out flyers
with Pete's picture on it.

05:39.720 --> 05:43.720
Why don't you give me a bunch?
I'll put some up in my neighbourhood.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.800
I'd really appreciate it.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.320
              How's Mr O'Casey doing?

05:49.320 --> 05:51.880
I still don't know yet.

05:51.880 --> 05:55.880
At least he's off the respirator
and he's got a partial return of
function in his legs.

05:56.280 --> 06:00.280
Jack. Don't sleep in this room.
It doesn't look good, OK?

06:16.320 --> 06:20.320
St Eligius' 50th anniversary is
turning out to be quite a shindig.

06:20.640 --> 06:24.160
I hope our hospital staff have
been co-operating with you on

06:24.160 --> 06:26.000
your oral retrospective.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.440
Well, it's been half-hearted at best.

06:28.440 --> 06:31.720
But since you've been here the
longest, the Historical Society is

06:31.720 --> 06:35.720
particularly interested
in your reminiscences.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.720
The sun was setting on
       the island of the rising sun.

06:39.720 --> 06:43.360
By leading the US forces
            in the invasion,

06:43.360 --> 06:46.000
McCarthy fulfilled his promise
      of "I shall return".

06:46.000 --> 06:48.960
Who shall ever forget the
magnificent image of the Marines

06:48.960 --> 06:51.320
planting the Stars and Stripes
      on Mt Suribachi?

06:51.320 --> 06:53.600
Excuse me, Dr Auschlander.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.640
Oh, yes.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.760
You need to speak
into the microphone.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.400
Yes, yes, of course.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.960
I always get carried away

06:59.960 --> 07:02.800
whenever I recall my Navy days
      in the Pacific theatre.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.800
Well, your work there
led you to be hired here
at St Eligius by Father McCabe.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.960
Yes. I arrived here
                 April 14th, 1945.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.920
Come in. &gt;

07:27.400 --> 07:28.440
Is this a bad time?

07:28.440 --> 07:30.120
Not at all, Daniel.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.440
I'm just reprimanding
this lad who was caught

07:32.440 --> 07:34.520
stealing a patient's pocketbook.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.560
What do you think
I should do to him?

07:36.560 --> 07:37.720
           Tan his hide.

07:37.720 --> 07:40.040
Oh, stay out of this, four eyes.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.960
Dr Daniel Auschlander, meet... &gt;

07:41.960 --> 07:44.040
Frankie Fish.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.360
..Donald Westphall.

07:46.360 --> 07:50.360
May I show you to your office?

08:05.440 --> 08:09.440
You'd better be sitting here when
I get back, or I'm coming after you.

08:16.760 --> 08:17.960
                     Father McCabe...

08:17.960 --> 08:20.440
Joseph. I can't tell you
how thrilled I am

08:20.440 --> 08:24.000
you're going to be working here.
St Eligius needs a liver specialist.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Your studies in hepatic dysfunction
and tropical diseases in the South
Pacific are very impressive.

08:36.320 --> 08:40.320
Daniel, we'll talk later.
I want to get back to that boy
before he's sent to reform school.

09:04.600 --> 09:08.600
I love what you've done
with the place.

09:11.280 --> 09:14.640
This office could use
  a desk lamp and some pictures.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.440
Maybe even a record player.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.800
But I'll tell you
               what it really needs.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.000
A woman's delicate touch.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.600
What a line!
You must be fresh from the service.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.320
&lt; Here. This is for you.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.520
Heavily starched, thank you.

09:28.520 --> 09:29.800
      How do you find Boston?

09:29.800 --> 09:33.200
Take a left at Rhode Island!

09:33.200 --> 09:35.840
I haven't seen much
of the town really.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.680
Maybe you could show me
     around some time?

09:37.680 --> 09:39.360
Maybe you could show me
     around some time?
             Perhaps.

09:39.360 --> 09:43.360
         See you. Friend.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.680
What are we doing here?

09:50.680 --> 09:54.680
Since you won't listen
to reason, I thought I'd
          knock some sense into you.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.240
I ain't fighting a priest!

09:59.240 --> 10:02.960
Don't worry,
God won't hold it against you.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.240
Your father came by last week.

10:05.240 --> 10:08.000
He said you're getting to be
   a real pain in the keister.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.320
and you haven't been to
     church in nearly a year.

10:10.320 --> 10:13.280
No need to.
Not gonna make me a better person.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.560
Maybe not,
  but you haven't been going to

10:15.560 --> 10:18.440
school either. And for sure,
that will make you stupid.

10:18.440 --> 10:21.120
   What have I got be smart for?

10:21.120 --> 10:24.640
Life dealt me a crummy hand, so
what's the use? Why should I play?

10:24.640 --> 10:27.240
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
Come on!

10:27.240 --> 10:30.520
     I ain't boxing with you.

10:30.520 --> 10:31.560
                Uh!

10:31.560 --> 10:35.320
You're going to run into pain and
disappointment your whole life.

10:35.320 --> 10:39.320
If you don't learn to face up
to it, you're going to get the tar
beat out of you every time.

10:40.120 --> 10:44.000
Now let's go.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.480
I know you love your family, Donald.
It must be ten years.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.480
Time to get on with your life.

10:59.560 --> 11:01.480
 There's no reason for what happened.

11:01.480 --> 11:03.120
Ah, it hurts growing up.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.920
                  I'll show you hurt!

11:04.920 --> 11:08.920
                   Die! Shut up. Die!

11:20.880 --> 11:22.200
                               Sorry.

11:22.200 --> 11:25.040
Have you looked through
             any mug shots?

11:25.040 --> 11:28.200
I only saw the back
of the guy's head.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.560
Maybe I should call
the police again.

11:30.560 --> 11:31.600
                       Jack, go home.

11:31.600 --> 11:35.400
I should have done something
for Pete. ID tags, fingerprints.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.160
   Jack, go home. I'll cover for you.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.480
Mr O'Casey, I still haven't
made the diagnosis.

11:40.480 --> 11:44.000
I thought it was meningitis till
he developed lower extremity paresis.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.840
Maybe you missed something
in the medical history.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.920
Mr O'Casey was pretty vague,
and his wife was even less help.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.480
Did you check the computer?

11:51.480 --> 11:53.320
Yeah, the records
only go back to '69.

11:53.320 --> 11:57.320
Well, this may come as a shock,
but there's a whole world
   that existed before floppy disks.

11:58.520 --> 12:02.480
Talk to Wayne in the basement
where all the back medical records
are in boxes.

12:02.480 --> 12:05.160
They're just sitting there,
waiting to be excavated.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.800
What do you mean,
I should go down there and

12:07.800 --> 12:10.080
dig around and try and...

12:10.080 --> 12:12.680
Try and uncover something?
Maybe I will.

12:12.680 --> 12:16.680
I'll call the police first.

12:22.320 --> 12:26.320
Do you think the cops
will ever find Jack's kid?

12:26.320 --> 12:29.920
Not a chance.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.200
&lt; Strong, Patrick, a real scrapper.

12:32.200 --> 12:35.800
&lt; Not many men get crushed
by a heavy machine and live
to tell the tale.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.120
&lt; The doctor says
I'm going to be fine.

12:38.120 --> 12:40.960
Patrick's worked in the mills
since he was 12.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.520
            Sometimes 18 hours a day.

12:43.520 --> 12:47.360
Trying to earn enough money
so we can get married.

12:47.360 --> 12:51.360
But if this is what wanting
a life together costs,
it is not worth the price.

12:51.920 --> 12:54.200
Alison, you can't think like that.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.880
America was built on hard work.

12:55.880 --> 12:59.840
Little by little we come closer
to the happiness my father
 came searching for.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.520
       Patrick. I love you.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.680
          But I'm afraid.

13:05.680 --> 13:09.680
I don't want us to start off
on the wrong foot, with no money.

13:09.720 --> 13:11.440
    I don't even have a dowry.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.400
We have each other.

13:13.400 --> 13:17.080
That will be enough.

13:17.080 --> 13:21.080
Father McCabe. Will you
       perform the wedding ceremony?

13:21.080 --> 13:25.080
When you're back on your feet, lad,
then you two come and see me.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.040
                         Dr Morrison.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.880
   Have you seen my mother any place?

13:34.880 --> 13:36.080
No, I'm afraid not.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.600
                     How's my father?

13:37.600 --> 13:41.600
Well, he's gotten back
some motor function in his legs
but he's still heavily sedated.

13:42.040 --> 13:45.120
So even when he wakes up,
conversation won't make much sense.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.400
                   Nothing new there.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.240
Kevin.

13:50.240 --> 13:54.120
Your anger is not going to
help your father get better.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.160
                             So what?

13:55.160 --> 13:58.440
He's done nothing but shove me out
of his life for the past two years.

13:58.440 --> 14:02.040
I came in yesterday, he didn't want
anything to do with me. You know why?

14:02.040 --> 14:06.040
                     Because I'm gay.

14:12.800 --> 14:16.800
My father acted as though my
homosexuality was an act of defiance.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.520
He took it personally.

14:20.520 --> 14:24.520
Rather than being glad that I was
finally happy with who I am,

14:25.440 --> 14:29.440
he stopped loving me.

14:29.680 --> 14:33.680
I became the son he never had.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.880
Kevin.

14:37.880 --> 14:41.880
Fathers and sons, they lose
each other for all kinds of reasons.

14:42.880 --> 14:46.880
Some get pushed away, some...

14:47.120 --> 14:51.120
If you want
         the relationship to last...

14:51.280 --> 14:54.320
..you have got to say
the things you feel now.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.920
Good or bad.

14:55.920 --> 14:59.880
Because someday you'll reach out

14:59.880 --> 15:03.880
and your dad won't be there.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.080
You promised me the roof
     would last a lifetime!

15:17.080 --> 15:21.080
Ten years is a very short life,
 wouldn't you say?

15:21.200 --> 15:24.560
No, I'm expecting you to come back
and fix what should have been taken

15:24.560 --> 15:28.080
care of when you
built this hospital!

15:28.080 --> 15:30.040
Well, what about craftsmanship?

15:30.040 --> 15:34.040
Have you no pride in your work?

15:34.760 --> 15:38.760
Well, when can you come back
and make the necessary repairs?

15:38.920 --> 15:42.920
Waiting until hell freezes over
is an ecumenical nonsense!

15:45.680 --> 15:49.680
Don't say it.

15:51.120 --> 15:54.880
I should have been more tactful.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.080
It's not going to work.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.800
The hospital's had financial
trouble before. I'll raise

15:59.800 --> 16:02.680
the money for the new roof,
bake sales or bingo or somehow.

16:02.680 --> 16:05.600
I'm referring to myself here.
It won't work.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.120
Why are you always running off
when I want to talk?

16:08.120 --> 16:09.800
We're talking. But I'm late for

16:09.800 --> 16:12.040
the meeting with
        the new cardinal. Hold that.

16:12.040 --> 16:15.040
A swastika and the word kike
are painted on my office wall.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.720
If that's the way people round here
feel about me, fine.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.760
I can catch the 8:00
back to New York City.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.000
Daniel, you can't leave.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.040
                            Watch me.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.560
Oh, come on!
First incident, you're going to run?

16:24.560 --> 16:28.320
Just a month ago I was
to be named at the Board of
Medical Quality Assurance.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.160
Underqualified, they said.
Too Semitic was the truth.

16:31.160 --> 16:35.160
If we don't stand up to hatred
and fear, it spreads. It kills.

16:35.560 --> 16:39.480
In the Army I was in a platoon.
It was the American melting pot.

16:39.480 --> 16:43.480
Some southerner asked me
why I was defending America
as if it wasn't my country.

16:43.560 --> 16:46.080
And my family has been here
for over 100 years.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.520
Well, I told that hick my grandfather

16:48.520 --> 16:51.920
fought for the North in the Civil
War. Then we got into fisticuffs.

16:51.920 --> 16:55.000
Before being drafted, I lost
my fiancee as she was a gentile.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.640
I need you here, Daniel.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.000
You and I can make the difference.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.960
If we don't leave this world in a
better shape than when we got here,

17:02.960 --> 17:06.800
what's the point?

17:06.800 --> 17:07.920
THUNDER RUMBLES

17:07.920 --> 17:11.240
Rain depresses some people.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.400
                              Not me.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.319
Don't go anywhere until I get back.

17:15.319 --> 17:19.319
Please.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.280
Excuse me.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.440
Doctor. Doctor.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.080
My name's Patrick O'Casey.
My daughter's in there.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.480
She was brought in two days ago.
I have to see her.

17:35.480 --> 17:38.280
You can't, not until
she's allowed out of isolation.

17:38.280 --> 17:41.080
Patrick just got home last night.

17:41.080 --> 17:44.360
He hasn't seen Sarah since he left
for Fort Bragg eight months ago.

17:44.360 --> 17:48.360
All right. But you'll have to wait
here because of the risk to the baby.

17:52.800 --> 17:56.800
You'll have to be content
with looking at her
through this window for now.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.800
                     Can you see her?

17:58.800 --> 18:02.520
Yes, there she is.
That's Sarah, the one with the doll.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.200
What's going to happen to her?

18:04.200 --> 18:05.840
You really should
speak with her physician.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.840
You really should
speak with her physician.
Tell me!

18:07.840 --> 18:10.760
Well, poliomyelitis attacks
the spinal cord and brain.

18:10.760 --> 18:14.760
The muscle groups are destroyed.
Many children recover entirely,
others can only move an arm or a leg.

18:15.760 --> 18:19.760
And some die.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.320
Am I going to lose my little girl?

18:25.320 --> 18:28.960
The wonder of medicine, Mr O'Casey,
is it is unpredictable.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.880
You and your wife have to be strong.

18:31.880 --> 18:34.880
Your daughter needs to know
that you haven't given up,

18:34.880 --> 18:38.880
despite overwhelming adversity.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.320
Good news.

18:40.320 --> 18:44.320
I've been reading and re-reading
your family's history, trying

18:44.400 --> 18:48.240
to find some clue, a connection
to his symptoms, and suddenly,

18:48.240 --> 18:50.160
there it was.

18:50.160 --> 18:54.160
Mr O'Casey's sister Sarah
died of polio in 1955.

18:54.920 --> 18:58.920
She'd never been vaccinated.
And Mr O'Casey never received
proper immunisation.

19:00.560 --> 19:01.920
          He's got polio?

19:01.920 --> 19:05.920
Come on, Dr Morrison, this is 1986.
It's like saying he's
 a victim of the bubonic plague.

19:06.680 --> 19:09.280
In the '50s a lot of kids
were vaccinated with

19:09.280 --> 19:11.040
what's called a dead virus.

19:11.040 --> 19:15.040
But it only worked temporarily.
People like your father,
who were never followed up

19:15.680 --> 19:19.680
with booster injections,
lost immunity to polio
and are still susceptible.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.960
Jack.

19:21.960 --> 19:22.960
         Is there a cure?

19:22.960 --> 19:26.920
         Is there a cure?
Um... No, no.

19:26.920 --> 19:30.920
But the infection will eventually
dissipate and, with time and help

19:31.280 --> 19:35.280
from you both, he should be fine.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.720
How do you know?
My aunt died of polio.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.760
In cases like your father's
where there's been an early

19:41.760 --> 19:43.720
return of motor function,

19:43.720 --> 19:47.720
there's usually a full recovery.

19:49.560 --> 19:50.000
What is it?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.560
What is it?
The police called,
they think they found your son.

19:52.560 --> 19:53.000
Where is he?

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
Where is he?
Down the police station.
Come on, I'll drive.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.400
 Is there anything you'd like to add?

20:01.400 --> 20:02.920
Yes.

20:02.920 --> 20:06.800
Most people associate
hospitals with disease.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.000
I think of romance.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.760
But that's another story.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.720
                      Thank you. Bye.

20:13.720 --> 20:17.720
Goodbye.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.440
Shoeshine, please.

20:38.440 --> 20:41.480
I didn't think you wanted
a shave and a haircut.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.720
Decided to make
            some honest coin, I see.

20:43.720 --> 20:47.400
Just working off what I stole
from a couple of patients.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.560
Me and Father McCabe got a deal.

20:49.560 --> 20:52.640
I like the father.
It may take some time but

20:52.640 --> 20:54.840
I think I'm going to like it here.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.520
You come from money?

20:56.520 --> 21:00.360
No. My family was worse than poor.
My mother sewed in a sweatshop.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.720
My father pushed a clothing
rack down Seventh Avenue.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.240
My father pushed a clothing
rack down Seventh Avenue.
No kidding.

21:04.240 --> 21:08.200
You could buy wholesale
and you dress like that?

21:08.200 --> 21:10.040
How much do I owe you? &gt;

21:10.040 --> 21:12.160
I'm not finished.

21:12.160 --> 21:16.160
It's all right, they look natty.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.000
No, this one's on me.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.640
Cos I called you that name.

21:21.640 --> 21:25.640
You keep the change.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.280
Excuse me.

21:27.280 --> 21:30.160
Would you happen to know
where in town they mix

21:30.160 --> 21:31.760
an old-fashioned egg cream?

21:31.760 --> 21:34.080
I haven't had an egg cream in years.

21:34.080 --> 21:37.800
But I'll bet you could get one
at Hobson's on Franklin Street.

21:37.800 --> 21:40.080
Franklin Street...

21:40.080 --> 21:42.000
Mmm, you take Essex to Tremont,

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
turn right, go down two blocks and
it's just across from the cyclorama.

21:46.440 --> 21:50.440
Oh, wait a minute. I take Essex
     and I go two blocks and...

21:50.920 --> 21:53.080
Never mind!
Would you like me to show you?

21:53.080 --> 21:56.040
That would be wonderful.
I'm Daniel Auschlander.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.200
Katherine.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.880
You are a very handsome man.

22:00.880 --> 22:04.880
What a line!

22:50.800 --> 22:54.800
OK.

23:03.400 --> 23:07.400
It's not Pete.

23:09.440 --> 23:13.440
            Thank God.

23:20.520 --> 23:24.520
What do I have to do
      to get my boy back?

23:53.600 --> 23:54.240
Donny!

23:54.240 --> 23:57.880
Donny!
    Pop, help! Pop, I'm scared.

23:57.880 --> 24:01.880
Donny, go wake your brothers
and sisters. Elizabeth, wake up!

24:02.000 --> 24:03.560
         We can't get out.

24:03.560 --> 24:07.560
It's all right,
   sweetheart, I'll be there.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.240
Historical Society?

24:11.240 --> 24:14.600
Hysterical society, if you ask me.
You call this in an interview?

24:14.600 --> 24:17.480
Which, by the way, has run five
minutes longer than scheduled.

24:17.480 --> 24:20.080
You were talking about
your final years as a resident.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.880
Intern! Pay attention.

24:21.880 --> 24:24.200
As I was saying,
a lot of us were still wet

24:24.200 --> 24:26.160
behind the ears, we were just kids.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.520
But the world was simpler then.

24:28.520 --> 24:32.120
Dr Dominion, I say this
from the bottom of my heart.

24:32.120 --> 24:35.360
These years spent watching
you have been an inspiration.

24:35.360 --> 24:39.040
Can the histrionics, Craig, you've
been pandering to me for four years.

24:39.040 --> 24:41.200
Your internship's over, so clam up.

24:41.200 --> 24:44.120
You're right, sir, foolish of me
to think that I could

24:44.120 --> 24:46.760
pull the wool over the eyes of a man
with such vision.

24:46.760 --> 24:50.080
Let's move on to the next case.
Dr Westfall.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.280
Yes, sir.

24:51.280 --> 24:55.280
13-year-old Sarah O'Casey with polio
paresis, admitted three days ago

24:55.320 --> 24:57.000
with a respiratory

24:57.000 --> 24:59.960
insufficiency and infection.
Very likely bilateral pneumonia.

24:59.960 --> 25:01.200
    How are you feeling, Sarah?

25:01.200 --> 25:04.840
    How are you feeling, Sarah?
A little better. (COUGHS)

25:04.840 --> 25:06.560
 How long have you had that cough?

25:06.560 --> 25:08.480
 How long have you had that cough?
&lt; Since last night.

25:08.480 --> 25:12.280
Well, we'll have to do
something about that.

25:12.280 --> 25:13.560
Dr Westfall.

25:13.560 --> 25:14.440
Yeah?

25:14.440 --> 25:16.840
Yeah?
Could you stop by later
and read to me again?

25:16.840 --> 25:20.800
You bet.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.560
Here, try some of this.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.280
Didn't you pay attention
to what the attending said,

25:25.280 --> 25:29.280
never get emotionally attached
to the patients.

25:36.120 --> 25:37.840
           Dr Westfall.

25:37.840 --> 25:41.200
Increase the dosage
to 400,000 units IM.

25:41.200 --> 25:41.560
By the way...

25:41.560 --> 25:44.720
By the way...
That will help clear up
the coughing and congestion.

25:44.720 --> 25:45.360
Yes, sir.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.240
Yes, sir.
By the way, early indications

25:47.240 --> 25:50.440
suggest that Dr Saul's preventive
polio vaccine is a success.

25:50.440 --> 25:52.920
I am aware of that,
dimwit, you are not the anyone

25:52.920 --> 25:54.520
who subscribes to the journal.

25:54.520 --> 25:57.040
who subscribes to the journal.
One more thing, sir.
I am honoured that you are

25:57.040 --> 25:58.840
allowing me to perform my first

25:58.840 --> 26:01.880
solo operation this afternoon.
A mitral valve commissurotomy.

26:01.880 --> 26:04.480
A procedure on the forefront
   of cardiac care.

26:04.480 --> 26:08.480
That's the great thing about St
Eligius. The nurturing, the wisdom.

26:09.920 --> 26:13.920
No place on earth comes close
to the family you've created here.

26:14.440 --> 26:18.440
Who's taffy do you think
you're pulling? Rounds are over.

26:19.560 --> 26:22.160
Well, it won't be long now.
The moment my call comes

26:22.160 --> 26:23.840
from Boston General, I'm leaving.

26:23.840 --> 26:26.280
St Eligius?  No, the planet!

26:26.280 --> 26:29.400
Boy, Donald, sometimes
you're really a stooge.

26:29.400 --> 26:33.400
Hey, Oliver. Stick an egg
in your shoe and beat it!

26:34.520 --> 26:37.200
I've really got a great career
      ahead of me, Donny, boy.

26:37.200 --> 26:40.080
Pretty soon I'll be earning double
digits. Life couldn't be better.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.760
Did you know Eleanor's pregnant?

26:41.760 --> 26:43.880
No! Terrific, congratulations.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.560
In 58 minutes she and I are

26:45.560 --> 26:49.080
meeting a real estate agent to look
at houses in Lincoln. I'm anxious to

26:49.080 --> 26:51.680
move to the suburbs now that
we're expecting a new arrival.

26:51.680 --> 26:52.640
What are you hoping for?

26:52.640 --> 26:56.160
What are you hoping for?
What else?
A two-storey colonial.

26:56.160 --> 27:00.160
"Rock Around The Clock"
    PLAYS ON THE RADIO

27:09.520 --> 27:12.480
Have you heard this one?

27:12.480 --> 27:16.040
There once was a girl
from Nantucket, whose goose

27:16.040 --> 27:18.720
every man tried to pluck it.
Its sides were so thick,

27:18.720 --> 27:22.720
its feet were so quick,
if it only sat down you could...

27:23.480 --> 27:24.960
Fill in the rest!

27:24.960 --> 27:26.240
     What's going on, Joseph?

27:26.240 --> 27:28.120
     What's going on, Joseph?
Mm.

27:28.120 --> 27:30.680
I'm celebrating.
Would you like a drink?

27:30.680 --> 27:34.680
You're drunk enough for both of us.

27:37.160 --> 27:40.000
Daniel.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
I've never told anyone this.

27:47.240 --> 27:51.240
I used to have dreams about
Clara Bow.

27:51.560 --> 27:53.160
1926. &gt;

27:53.160 --> 27:56.600
When the Man Trap came out.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.880
Being a priest, I couldn't go.

27:58.880 --> 28:02.880
I could only fantasise about it
in the privacy of my own mind.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.800
I was in my prime in
the roaring Twenties.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.720
The rest of the world was flapping,

28:08.720 --> 28:12.720
I was in the seminary,
flagellating myself.

28:13.640 --> 28:16.880
I was three years
assistant pastor of St Ursula's.

28:16.880 --> 28:20.880
I saw all sorts of people,
all sorts of hurts.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.640
Spiritual, emotional.

28:23.640 --> 28:27.640
Those are the people I could help.

28:27.800 --> 28:31.240
The ones in physical pain,

28:31.240 --> 28:34.000
the poor.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
Nobody was helping them.

28:38.480 --> 28:42.480
On All Saints Day,

28:42.520 --> 28:45.680
I made a vow.

28:45.680 --> 28:49.680
Someday,
I'd do something about that.

28:53.880 --> 28:57.080
       What's wrong, Joseph?

28:57.080 --> 29:01.080
I just had a lovely
     chat with the Archbishop

29:01.080 --> 29:02.960
Cushing,

29:02.960 --> 29:05.600
Cushing cushioned the blow.

29:05.600 --> 29:09.600
And then he fired me.

29:11.080 --> 29:15.040
# We will meet, but we will miss him

29:15.040 --> 29:19.040
# There will be
      one vacant chair... #

29:21.120 --> 29:24.600
That's a Civil War song, you know.
Your grandfather sang it,

29:24.600 --> 29:26.240
like as not.

29:26.240 --> 29:30.240
# Now a golden cord is severed,
and our hopes in ruin lie. #

29:42.400 --> 29:46.200
Now don't talk to me about making
the third bedroom into a study.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.720
If that was what he'd
meant it to be, the architect would

29:48.720 --> 29:50.520
have put it on the ground floor.

29:50.520 --> 29:54.040
Obviously another item
in a long list of design flaws.

29:54.040 --> 29:58.000
Would you excuse us, please?

29:58.000 --> 30:00.320
DOOR CLOSES

30:00.320 --> 30:04.320
Isn't this the greatest house
you've ever seen?

30:05.040 --> 30:09.040
I mean, isn't this where
a surgeon should live?

30:09.880 --> 30:12.560
The way you've been ranting,
I thought you hated this place.

30:12.560 --> 30:15.640
No, no, that was just to keep
the real estate agent hungry.

30:15.640 --> 30:18.640
I get hungry too, Mark.
If we pay for this house, how can

30:18.640 --> 30:20.920
we afford to eat or raise a child?

30:20.920 --> 30:24.440
Ellen, what's to worry?

30:24.440 --> 30:27.480
Sipping brandy while
watching embers glow.

30:27.480 --> 30:30.800
          ¤50,000 at 4%?

30:30.800 --> 30:34.800
That really scares me. I think
we're getting in way over our heads.

30:35.120 --> 30:36.280
Eleanor.

30:36.280 --> 30:40.160
I have a great career ahead of me,
at Boston General.

30:40.160 --> 30:41.920
Did Dr Kearns call?

30:41.920 --> 30:43.400
No.

30:43.400 --> 30:44.720
Dr Kearns's associate?

30:44.720 --> 30:47.800
Dr Kearns's associate?
Oh, for Pete's sake, Ellen.
Have a little confidence in me.

30:47.800 --> 30:51.520
I'll get the appointment.
And when I do, I will begin to build

30:51.520 --> 30:55.520
a fabulous clientele. I mean, people
will be dying to get in to see me!

30:58.240 --> 31:00.320
      I'm getting a headache.

31:00.320 --> 31:02.640
Ellen, relax.

31:02.640 --> 31:06.360
We are going to be very happy here.
Come here.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.600
Pssh.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.760
One for you.

31:10.760 --> 31:14.760
Pssh. To the three of us,
may we live happily ever after.

31:18.360 --> 31:22.360
Oh, I know it's a girl.

31:25.720 --> 31:27.720
     This cast is disgusting.

31:27.720 --> 31:30.000
You should have had it changed weeks
ago. You've got weeping dermatitis.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.600
You should have had it changed weeks
ago. You've got weeping dermatitis.
What are you going to do?

31:32.600 --> 31:33.680
        Wait here and see.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.080
        Wait here and see.
Boomer.

31:35.080 --> 31:38.680
Everyone's talking about how
you diagnosed Mr O'Casey's polio.

31:38.680 --> 31:40.280
All I did was check
       the medical history.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.320
All I did was check
       the medical history.
Yeah, but you looked for
something beyond the obvious.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.320
Your instincts were right.

31:43.320 --> 31:45.440
Your instincts were right.
Maybe.

31:45.440 --> 31:48.240
Everybody knows you've had a
lot of problems here over the last

31:48.240 --> 31:51.280
couple of years, it's no wonder
your self-confidence is broken.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.040
Despite what any of us may say,

31:53.040 --> 31:56.480
and despite what you might think,
you are still as capable

31:56.480 --> 31:59.120
as any doctor in this hospital.
Because you care.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.000
So I'm a good doctor?

32:01.000 --> 32:03.560
Is not a question, Jack.

32:03.560 --> 32:06.240
I'm a good doctor.

32:06.240 --> 32:10.240
                    And now, the leg.

32:44.680 --> 32:45.720
               Dad?

32:45.720 --> 32:49.720
All right, pal?

32:53.280 --> 32:54.720
How are you feeling?

32:54.720 --> 32:55.880
How are you feeling?
Thirsty.

32:55.880 --> 32:56.320
Yeah?

32:56.320 --> 33:00.320
Yeah?
My throat hurts.

33:07.120 --> 33:11.120
There you go. Go easy.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.800
Better?

33:14.800 --> 33:18.800
The fire...

33:19.320 --> 33:22.720
I wasn't sure
that I would ever see you again.

33:22.720 --> 33:26.240
I know, it was
      pretty frightening, wasn't it?

33:26.240 --> 33:30.240
Donny, you and I are going
   to have to talk now, man to man.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.720
You know how much
I loved your brothers

33:32.720 --> 33:34.520
and your sister and your mum.

33:34.520 --> 33:38.480
Well, I did everything I could.

33:38.480 --> 33:41.160
But sometimes,
         no matter how hard we try,

33:41.160 --> 33:45.160
it's not enough.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.440
They died in that fire, Son.

33:47.440 --> 33:51.440
They died in that fire, Son.
          Where are they?

33:51.600 --> 33:52.880
They're in heaven.

33:52.880 --> 33:54.600
They're in heaven.
   Will we ever see them again?

33:54.600 --> 33:56.560
Yes, some day.

33:56.560 --> 34:00.560
                Oh.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.640
It's just you and me, pal.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.159
      Don't ever leave, Pop.

34:08.159 --> 34:12.159
      Don't ever leave, Pop.
No, I wouldn't do that to you.

34:22.600 --> 34:26.600
...Silk on a cardiac needle.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.280
I'm putting a purse string suture

34:30.280 --> 34:33.960
in the left atrium appendage
in preparation to perform

34:33.960 --> 34:36.280
a commissurotomy. Oliver.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.560
Hold the purse-string, please?

34:37.560 --> 34:40.199
Hold the purse-string, please?
Are you asking him to dance?
Leave Emily posted in the scrub room.

34:40.199 --> 34:43.840
A-ha.

34:43.840 --> 34:46.840
Scalpel.

34:46.840 --> 34:50.679
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

34:50.679 --> 34:54.679
The mitral.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.200
       Come on, number one!

35:03.200 --> 35:05.600
Even a trained seal
could do this procedure.

35:05.600 --> 35:07.520
Right.

35:07.520 --> 35:10.080
I'll use the Gabaudy

35:10.080 --> 35:14.080
to separate the valve leaflets,
and broaden the restricted openings.

35:15.160 --> 35:19.160
Watch the interventricular septum.

35:20.400 --> 35:22.560
If London weren't shaking
like a bowl of gelatine...

35:22.560 --> 35:26.560
Go on, blame someone else
because you haven't got the guts.

35:34.800 --> 35:38.800
Stay right here
and don't touch a thing.

35:41.520 --> 35:44.000
           What the hell is going on?

35:44.000 --> 35:47.120
Four years, I've looked up to you.

35:47.120 --> 35:51.120
I've watched your every move. I've
tried to emulate your techniques.

35:52.760 --> 35:56.120
I've looked forward to this day
 all my life, and now,

35:56.120 --> 35:57.760
I wish it had never arrived.

35:57.760 --> 36:00.320
I wish it had never arrived.
Well, that's just too bad
because here it is.

36:00.320 --> 36:03.560
And Mr Kellogg is in there
relying on you to save his life.

36:03.560 --> 36:06.280
This is no time
to turn into a bonehead.

36:06.280 --> 36:08.200
I'm a failure.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.960
Oh, Lord.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.120
How do I tell my father?

36:13.120 --> 36:16.160
I have not invested
four years in you for nothing.

36:16.160 --> 36:18.600
You may be arrogant, self-centred
and opinionated, but you're never

36:18.600 --> 36:22.320
     a failure until you stop trying.

36:22.320 --> 36:26.320
Besides, how do you think you look
to those interns up in the gallery?

36:30.840 --> 36:34.000
             Pathetic!

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
     Like you don't have any.

36:38.360 --> 36:41.840
I'll do the operation.

36:41.840 --> 36:45.840
            Oh, goody!

36:49.640 --> 36:53.640
Any signs of life?

37:06.880 --> 37:10.880
          Mrs O'Casey...

37:45.160 --> 37:48.280
A person spends his life
trying to help people.

37:48.280 --> 37:52.280
But then one day someone says,
we won't let you do that any more.

37:53.280 --> 37:56.680
    Your dismissal is a shame.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.640
I've been reassigned
    to a diocese near Phoenix.

37:59.640 --> 38:03.560
Be teaching Holy Communion to the
local tribes, that sort of thing.

38:03.560 --> 38:06.560
The Archbishop actually tried
to convince me that Arizona's

38:06.560 --> 38:08.280
the best place for my sinuses.

38:08.280 --> 38:09.960
And my short game.

38:09.960 --> 38:11.680
I know better.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.600
I've stepped on a lot
of toes hereabouts.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.560
I'm surprised they put
up with me this long.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.360
I'm surprised they put
up with me this long.
           Refuse to go!

38:18.360 --> 38:20.200
Oh, I can't!

38:20.200 --> 38:22.240
I've taken a vow of obedience.

38:22.240 --> 38:26.240
Besides, there's no reason to stay.

38:26.440 --> 38:29.360
Archbishop Cushing
also informed me that

38:29.360 --> 38:32.200
the city's made
  an offer to buy the hospital.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.640
And the Church
   is tired of bottle washing.

38:34.640 --> 38:38.320
St Eligius officially
changes hands in January.

38:38.320 --> 38:42.320
I want you to know that I'm
going to tender my resignation.

38:44.680 --> 38:47.280
I want you to know that I'm
going to tender my resignation.
Oh. Well now, that's a problem.

38:47.280 --> 38:51.280
Because I've recommended
you to replace me.

38:53.200 --> 38:57.200
I need somebody I can trust
         to run my hospital.

38:59.120 --> 39:03.120
Hardly a soul around
has ever heard of St Eligius.

39:03.160 --> 39:07.160
The patron saint of
artisans and craftsmen.

39:07.680 --> 39:10.400
My father was a cabinet maker.

39:10.400 --> 39:13.240
All his life
           he prayed to St Eligius.

39:13.240 --> 39:17.120
I figured
he'd show us special attention.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.960
But judging from the way
     the roof is built,

39:19.960 --> 39:23.960
I'd say he was out to lunch
a good deal of the time.

39:26.680 --> 39:30.680
Take care of my hospital, Daniel.

39:30.920 --> 39:34.920
She's been good to me.

39:43.720 --> 39:44.400
Hi.

39:44.400 --> 39:46.200
Hi.
Donald. You are looking at

39:46.200 --> 39:49.480
at Boston General's newest
and brightest cardiac surgeon.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.280
I'm happy for you, Mark.

39:51.280 --> 39:53.960
Did you see what
Dominion passed on to me?

39:53.960 --> 39:56.080
The Gabaudy mitral valvular tome.

39:56.080 --> 39:58.080
My first surgical instrument.

39:58.080 --> 40:01.920
His way of wishing you luck, huh?

40:01.920 --> 40:04.640
Dominion doesn't know I'm leaving.

40:04.640 --> 40:06.960
Mark, don't you feel some sort
of commitment to this hospital?

40:06.960 --> 40:08.120
Look.

40:08.120 --> 40:10.640
Boston General is a real hospital.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.880
It already has a heart-lung machine.

40:12.880 --> 40:16.080
I'll be doing
open-heart operations soon.

40:16.080 --> 40:19.240
And I can tell you something else,
Mr I Want To Be A Kidney Specialist.

40:19.240 --> 40:23.240
You should consider making the jump
to the General, if they'll have you.

40:25.160 --> 40:27.800
A doctor over there
  just did a kidney transplant,

40:27.800 --> 40:29.680
the cutting edge of medicine.

40:29.680 --> 40:33.520
It's at BG. What are you doing with
that cigarette? Don't you read?

40:33.520 --> 40:37.040
There is a greater death
rate among people who smoke.

40:37.040 --> 40:40.120
No, I don't think I could leave
St Eligius, Mark, I really don't.

40:40.120 --> 40:42.640
I feel a connection here with
the people, the neighbourhood.

40:42.640 --> 40:45.360
Hey, I'm happy that you have
a deep and abiding affection

40:45.360 --> 40:47.680
for this slaughter house
and all these sleaze bags.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.440
But not me.

40:49.440 --> 40:52.040
Good luck with
             your career, Westfall.

40:52.040 --> 40:53.520
Better tell Dominion you're leaving.

40:53.520 --> 40:57.520
Better tell Dominion you're leaving.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:09.520 --> 41:12.520
Oh, Craig.
Just dropped in on Mr Kellogg.

41:12.520 --> 41:14.320
He's doing well.
You should be pleased.

41:14.320 --> 41:14.680
Thank you, sir.

41:14.680 --> 41:18.040
Thank you, sir.
You wouldn't happen to know where
my Gabaudy mitral valvular tome is?

41:18.040 --> 41:20.480
No, sir.

41:20.480 --> 41:23.520
Sir. About my coming back
           next year...

41:23.520 --> 41:27.040
I'm looking forward to it.
God knows why.

41:27.040 --> 41:31.040
Yeah, me too, sir.

41:44.280 --> 41:46.080
MICROPHONE ECHOES

41:46.080 --> 41:50.080
Is it working?

41:50.080 --> 41:51.760
      Wait a minute, Donald.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.520
         Listen, everyone.

41:53.520 --> 41:55.200
            Quiet down.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.760
             Hey, you!

41:57.760 --> 42:00.000
             Shut up!

42:00.000 --> 42:02.240
             Go ahead.

42:02.240 --> 42:05.600
Well.

42:05.600 --> 42:08.080
Here we are.

42:08.080 --> 42:10.160
Looking at the past,

42:10.160 --> 42:11.760
thinking of the future.

42:11.760 --> 42:15.600
And, like it or not,
we have to face our feelings

42:15.600 --> 42:19.000
and mistakes and our shortcomings.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.720
God knows we've seen enough pain

42:21.720 --> 42:23.680
and death.

42:23.680 --> 42:25.560
So I suppose we should be depressed.

42:25.560 --> 42:28.520
But because this building stands
here, and because of the people

42:28.520 --> 42:30.840
who have walked through that door,

42:30.840 --> 42:34.840
the human spirit prospers,
    and moves on.

42:35.200 --> 42:38.840
You know, it wasn't long ago that,
if a man came in here with

42:38.840 --> 42:41.600
a dying heart,
all we could offer was solace.

42:41.600 --> 42:45.600
And now we can offer a transplant.

42:46.360 --> 42:49.400
And that, to me, is amazing.

42:49.400 --> 42:53.080
They call us a teaching hospital.

42:53.080 --> 42:55.400
But I find this a learning place.

42:55.400 --> 42:59.400
And whether it be nurses or
orderlies or surgeons, or patients,

43:01.160 --> 43:03.840
we all have something
to offer each other.

43:03.840 --> 43:06.320
And I want to salute those
people who have brought us

43:06.320 --> 43:10.320
to this celebration, and to those
who will lead us in the future.

43:11.280 --> 43:15.280
Daniel?

43:21.200 --> 43:24.720
Happy birthday, St Eligius.

43:24.720 --> 43:25.640
To the future!

43:25.640 --> 43:29.640
To the future!
To the future!

43:36.120 --> 43:38.640
                 How's the new cast?

43:38.640 --> 43:40.080
Fine.

43:40.080 --> 43:43.400
Jack, look!

43:43.400 --> 43:47.400
Oh!

43:53.920 --> 43:55.800
Hiya, buddy.

43:55.800 --> 43:59.800
              Daddy.

44:44.440 --> 44:46.720
Quite a hospital
you've built, Father.

44:46.720 --> 44:48.600
Well, it's God's design to be sure.

44:48.600 --> 44:51.040
Since he never went
to architecture school, I had

44:51.040 --> 44:53.080
 to draw up the blueprints myself.

44:53.080 --> 44:57.080
Let's see you hit Flannery's
pub across the street.

44:58.320 --> 45:35.000
             'Got it!'
