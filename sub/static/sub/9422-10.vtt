00:04.104 --> 00:07.040
(Doorbell rings)

00:07.040 --> 00:10.110
(Knocks on door)

00:12.112 --> 00:16.049
Hi. Kate Scott.
"Scandalous magazine."

00:16.049 --> 00:18.051
Mm. The Darlings aren't home.

00:18.051 --> 00:20.053
Oh, well, um... (Laughs)

00:20.053 --> 00:22.122
Do you know
when they might be back?

00:22.122 --> 00:24.124
The Darlings are away
for Thanksgiving.

00:24.124 --> 00:26.059
Well, I am doing

00:26.059 --> 00:28.061
a 2,000-word exposÃ©
on the family and--

00:28.061 --> 00:31.064
I'm familiar with your column.
"Red carpet confidential."

00:31.064 --> 00:33.066
Not a fan?
Come on, what have you got,

00:33.066 --> 00:36.036
a couple of shots of Karen
sunbathing topless in Ibiza?

00:36.036 --> 00:40.007
Print 'em.
Oh, actually, this is not
a puff piece.

00:40.007 --> 00:41.074
And if I wanted

00:41.074 --> 00:44.011
to print pictures
of Karen Darling's ya-yas,

00:44.011 --> 00:46.013
I wouldn't have to look hard.

00:46.013 --> 00:48.081
No, I'm doing a piece
about family betrayal,

00:48.081 --> 00:50.117
criminal cover-ups
and murder.

00:50.117 --> 00:52.085
I'm just the chauffeur.

00:52.085 --> 00:54.087
Which means you have
a front-row seat

00:54.087 --> 00:56.089
for every
sordid Darling debacle.

00:56.089 --> 00:58.091
I drive the car.
I don't see much.

00:58.091 --> 01:01.061
That's not
what I hear, Clark.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.131
Look, I go to press
in six hours.

01:04.131 --> 01:07.000
It's part of
our holiday special issue.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.037
I just want to fact-check
my story.

01:10.037 --> 01:12.105
Or the I can run
the piece as is.

01:12.105 --> 01:15.075
It's your choice.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.013
Wow.

01:20.013 --> 01:22.049
I always wondered
what this place looked like.

01:22.049 --> 01:24.051
It's just a family home.

01:24.051 --> 01:26.053
So was versailles.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.094
So...

01:34.094 --> 01:36.096
How long
is this gonna take?

01:36.096 --> 01:40.133
20 minutes.
An hour tops.

01:40.133 --> 01:44.104
Okay, first question--
I have information

01:44.104 --> 01:47.107
that before Letitia was charged
with the murder of Dutch George,

01:47.107 --> 01:50.077
the police were investigating
somebody else.

01:50.077 --> 01:53.046
Well, they should've stayed
focused on that person,

01:53.046 --> 01:56.083
because, as you know,
Mrs. Darling was found innocent.

01:56.083 --> 01:59.019
Who is this suspect?

01:59.019 --> 02:02.055
Her husband, your boss--
Tripp Darling.

02:02.055 --> 02:05.025
Mr. Darling was never
under investigation

02:05.025 --> 02:07.027
for the murder
of Dutch George.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.128
Check your sources.
So you're denying

02:09.128 --> 02:13.066
that when Patrick Darling
was the Attorney General...
Okay, whoa. Wait a second.

02:13.066 --> 02:16.103
Of the state of New York, he
investigated his own father...
Okay, okay.

02:16.103 --> 02:20.007
Before that investigation
mysteriously went away?
You're half right.

02:20.007 --> 02:23.043
A while back, Patrick was
going after his father,

02:23.043 --> 02:26.013
but it didn't have anything
to do with Dutch's murder.

02:26.013 --> 02:28.015
(Clark)
This whole thing started

02:28.015 --> 02:30.117
when Tripp received
an unexpected visitor.

02:30.117 --> 02:32.119
Mr. Tripp Darling?
Yeah.

02:32.119 --> 02:35.088
You been served.
(Man) Let's go.

02:35.088 --> 02:37.124
What's that?

02:37.124 --> 02:41.028
Well, it's a subpoena from
the Attorney General's office,

02:41.028 --> 02:43.030
signed by Patrick,
calling you to testify

02:43.030 --> 02:45.065
in the Fantini brothers case.

02:45.065 --> 02:47.067
Tripp needed
that subpoena to go away.

02:47.067 --> 02:49.069
The fact that the investigation

02:49.069 --> 02:51.071
was being brought
by Tripp's son Patrick

02:51.071 --> 02:53.073
and that the two hadn't exactly
been getting along

02:53.073 --> 02:55.108
made things
even more complicated.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.110
(Nick) I can try to quash it.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.079
No,
trying is not good enough.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.081
It is imperative
that the two of you

03:01.081 --> 03:04.117
figure out a way to make sure
that I am not compelled

03:04.117 --> 03:07.120
to walk into that courtroom.
Why don't you want
to testify?

03:07.120 --> 03:10.057
They're mobsters, Brian.
The Fantini brothers
have a long

03:10.057 --> 03:12.059
and tempestuous history
with us.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.027
Our professional dealings
with them

03:14.027 --> 03:16.029
have always been
above board,

03:16.029 --> 03:18.031
ethically pristine.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.033
But if am called
to bear witness,

03:20.033 --> 03:22.035
they'll do everything
in their power

03:22.035 --> 03:25.105
to make the court believe that
all of their foul corruption

03:25.105 --> 03:27.074
stems from us.

03:27.074 --> 03:29.009
Regrettably...

03:29.009 --> 03:31.044
Patrick knows this, too.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.113
I'll take care of it.

03:33.113 --> 03:36.016
Well... take care of it.

03:36.016 --> 03:39.019
So Nick and Brian
went to see Patrick,

03:39.019 --> 03:41.054
you know, to try and keep
this misunderstanding

03:41.054 --> 03:43.056
within the family.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.124
Patrick, as Attorney General,

03:44.124 --> 03:47.060
it's within your power to offer
the Fantini brothers a deal.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.062
Your office gets
an easy conviction,

03:49.062 --> 03:51.031
and it saves taxpayers
some money

03:51.031 --> 03:54.034
on what would be a lengthy
and messy trial--case closed.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.069
I already offered
the Fantini brothers

03:56.069 --> 03:59.106
a very reasonable plea deal,
and they wouldn't take it.
Well, then drop the case,
dumb-ass.

03:59.106 --> 04:03.010
Hey, what happened
to hanging back?
What happened
to getting the job done?

04:03.010 --> 04:05.078
Brian, asking me
to drop the case

04:05.078 --> 04:08.015
is an obstruction of justice.
That's a felony.

04:08.015 --> 04:11.018
Uh, surely Nick must have
explained that to you already.

04:11.018 --> 04:14.087
Unless he's
in on the plan, too.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.024
My, how, uh,
things have changed.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.125
Hey, would you drop
the prissy tone?

04:19.125 --> 04:22.029
We're talking about
your father.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.064
I could talk like
Clint Eastwood if you like,

04:24.064 --> 04:26.033
but my hands are tied.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.101
The Fantini brothers
wanted the big show,

04:28.101 --> 04:31.038
and I'm just, uh,
bringing the popcorn.
Patrick, we all know

04:31.038 --> 04:33.106
that the only reason you're
going after the Fantini brothers

04:33.106 --> 04:36.009
is to attack Tripp.
Uh, listen, gentlemen,
thanks for coming.

04:36.009 --> 04:38.078
If you'll excuse me, I've gotta
get back to my career

04:38.078 --> 04:40.047
of fighting crime.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.082
Patrick, this isn't over.

04:42.082 --> 04:45.018
Really? (Chuckles)

04:45.018 --> 04:47.020
Seems like it is.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.056
After striking out
with Patrick,

04:49.056 --> 04:51.058
Nick wanted to go
through channels.

04:51.058 --> 04:55.028
Brian chose
a... less diplomatic approach.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.096
I-I just, I, uh--

04:56.096 --> 04:58.031
let me guess.
Brian's here.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.067
Should I send him in?
Nice work, Daisy.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.069
You got it.
Look, I have called
the governor's office,

05:02.069 --> 05:03.136
I am waiting to hear

05:03.136 --> 05:06.039
on a judge's ruling on
an injunction, and right now,

05:06.039 --> 05:08.075
I have to get home and see
my daughter for dinner, okay?
Well, that must be nice.

05:08.075 --> 05:11.011
Meaning?
To accomplish
absolutely nothing

05:11.011 --> 05:13.080
and then go home
with so much friggin' bacon.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.083
What do you want
from me, Brian?
I want you to be half the guy
Tripp thinks you are

05:16.083 --> 05:18.118
and get something done.
I just said I'm on it.

05:18.118 --> 05:21.021
No, you know what?
I'm on it.
What does that mean?

05:21.021 --> 05:22.089
You're never gonna get Patrick

05:22.089 --> 05:24.091
or anybody else
to dismiss this case.

05:24.091 --> 05:27.027
The papers have made too much
of a big deal out of it,

05:27.027 --> 05:30.030
and Patrick is never
gonna back down.
Well, you're right about that,
but what are you gonna do?

05:30.030 --> 05:32.099
I'm gonna go down to Jersey,
talk to these Fantini brothers,

05:32.099 --> 05:35.068
and maybe get 'em
to make a deal.
These guys are connected,
Brian. They're dangerous.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.070
You're gonna walk in there
and say what?

05:37.070 --> 05:40.073
I'm Brian Darling, paisan,
and this is how it's gonna be.

05:40.073 --> 05:44.011
How the hell
were you ever a minister?
You ever read the Bible?

05:44.011 --> 05:48.015
It's full of aggravating people
that get things done.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.017
Check it out.

05:50.017 --> 05:54.021
I wish I could tell you
that Brian was all talk,

05:54.021 --> 05:57.090
but when that kid
gets an idea in his head...

05:57.090 --> 06:01.094
(Billy Squiers
everybody wants you playing)

06:01.094 --> 06:04.031
? You see em coming at you
every night ?

06:04.031 --> 06:05.098
Sorry to keep you waiting,
padre.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.067
That's ex-padre.

06:07.067 --> 06:10.070
You know, I don't even know
if this is allowed.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.072
The son of a witness,
the brother of Patrick Darling

06:12.072 --> 06:14.107
talking to defendants?

06:14.107 --> 06:17.010
All of a sudden you're
a stickler for the rules?

06:17.010 --> 06:19.012
Give me a break.
So what do you want?

06:19.012 --> 06:21.081
I know you didn't come
all the way to Jersey

06:21.081 --> 06:24.084
just to catch a glimpse
of some of that.
I want you to make a deal.

06:24.084 --> 06:27.020
Take a suspended sentence
or something,

06:27.020 --> 06:29.089
and make this case go away.
Why would we do that?

06:29.089 --> 06:31.091
Because if you don't,
you just might end up

06:31.091 --> 06:33.093
rotting away in prison
where you both friggin' belong.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.095
Why don't you let
your brother--little paddy--

06:35.095 --> 06:37.998
worry about such stuff, huh?

06:37.998 --> 06:41.101
Look, we can handle this
one of two ways.

06:41.101 --> 06:44.104
You take a deal, or I can call
my brother and make sure

06:44.104 --> 06:48.008
that you both go to jail
for a long, long time.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.042
âªâªâª

06:49.042 --> 06:50.077
Ugh! (Grunts)

06:50.077 --> 06:52.012
I make it a policy

06:52.012 --> 06:54.081
to stay out
of Darling family business,

06:54.081 --> 06:56.083
but Brian was in
way over his head.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.118
(Telephone rings)

06:58.118 --> 07:00.053
Hey, Clark, what's up?

07:00.053 --> 07:02.022
I'm sorry to bother you,
Mr. George,

07:02.022 --> 07:04.024
but Brian
made me drop him off

07:04.024 --> 07:06.093
at the Fantini brothers'
strip joint in Jersey

07:06.093 --> 07:08.095
about two hours ago.
Unbelievable.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.063
I-I tried to get inside
a few times,

07:10.063 --> 07:14.034
but the goons
won't let me in.
I'll be right there.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.135
Brian...

07:15.135 --> 07:18.105
You all right?

07:18.105 --> 07:21.074
Good evening.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.110
Mikey, relax.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.046
Yeah, you, too, Clark.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.048
So you're Dutch's kid, huh?

07:28.048 --> 07:30.050
Yeah.
Well, I hope you got
more manners

07:30.050 --> 07:32.019
than this potty-mouthed priest
over here.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.988
Look, I came here to tell you
that Patrick Darling

07:34.988 --> 07:36.990
is gonna offer you
a plea bargain

07:36.990 --> 07:39.993
that you're gonna
find acceptable.
And why should we
believe you?

07:39.993 --> 07:42.029
Because it's the truth.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.097
I give you my word.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.099
Well, if you're anything like
your old man,

07:46.099 --> 07:49.102
that's good enough for me.

07:49.102 --> 07:52.072
Get him outta here, will you?

07:52.072 --> 07:54.074
Brian, let's go.

07:54.074 --> 07:58.078
(Man)
âª always brings me back âª

07:58.078 --> 07:59.112
Clark.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.114
Yes.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.050
Clark!

08:03.050 --> 08:05.118
Yeah, c--thank you.
That's really good.

08:05.118 --> 08:08.088
(Woman) Anytime.
I get lonely sometimes.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.057
Sue me.

08:10.057 --> 08:13.093
Anyway, Nick promised he could
get Patrick to play ball.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.996
Now he just needed
to deliver.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.066
How'd he plan on
doing that?

08:19.066 --> 08:22.035
Well, behind every Darling man
is a good woman.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.104
Sometimes... two.

08:24.104 --> 08:27.040
(Chuckles)
Care to elaborate?

08:27.040 --> 08:31.111
Patrick was having trouble
with his... girlfriend.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.046
Carmelita?
Yes.

08:33.046 --> 08:36.015
She'd kind of flown the Coop
on Patrick's election night.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.085
Now Nick figured if he could
track down Carmelita,

08:38.085 --> 08:41.020
then Patrick would be
much more agreeable

08:41.020 --> 08:44.057
on the whole Fantini mess.
Did it work?

08:44.057 --> 08:45.092
Like a charm.

08:45.092 --> 08:48.061
Okay, what the hell is
so important that you got...

08:48.061 --> 08:50.030
What happened to you?

08:50.030 --> 08:52.099
(Makes popping sound)
We have some news
about Carmelita.

08:52.099 --> 08:55.002
Do--do you know
where she is?

08:55.002 --> 08:57.104
Hey, relax.
Well, what do you know?

08:57.104 --> 09:00.107
I have a phone number
where she can be reached.
Let's have it.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.109
Well, pat, I'm not gonna
give it to you.

09:02.109 --> 09:05.078
I'll let you talk to her...
If you retract the subpoena.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.048
Oh, you're...
You're kidding, right?

09:08.048 --> 09:10.050
No, he's not kidding.
I'm dead serious, pat.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.052
If you want to talk
to Carmelita,

09:12.052 --> 09:14.054
you'll retract the subpoena,

09:14.054 --> 09:17.991
make the Fantini brothers
a deal they'll accept.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.060
Do not let this go to trial.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.129
You two have sunk
to a new low.

09:22.129 --> 09:25.098
You're using Carmelita
for your own wretched gains?

09:25.098 --> 09:28.035
I know. Isn't it great?

09:28.035 --> 09:29.036
(Scoffs)

09:29.036 --> 09:30.103
Fine, okay.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.105
All right.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.107
Here you go.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.043
What--what is this?

09:36.043 --> 09:39.046
Just a little statement
declaring your unwavering intent

09:39.046 --> 09:41.014
to quash the subpoena.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.016
I don't want you
changing your mind.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.018
What the hell
has happened to you?

09:45.018 --> 09:48.021
The Fantini brothers
took their sweetheart deal,

09:48.021 --> 09:50.057
the subpoena went away--

09:50.057 --> 09:52.125
case closed.

09:52.125 --> 09:57.064
Now you probably want to beat
that Thanksgiving traffic, so...

09:57.064 --> 10:00.067
You know, before I leave,
I wanted to mention,

10:00.067 --> 10:03.003
I keep hearing these rumors.
Rumors?

10:03.003 --> 10:06.039
About Ellen Darling's death
and your involvement

10:06.039 --> 10:08.041
in a potential cover-up.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.077
(Laughs) That's ridiculous.
Is it, Clark?

10:10.077 --> 10:13.046
You have no proof
of anything.

10:13.046 --> 10:16.049
No, not yet, but if you
don't start cooperating,

10:16.049 --> 10:18.085
I'll make damn sure
I find some.

10:21.021 --> 10:24.024
âªâªâª

10:35.102 --> 10:38.105
I'm glad I was able
to help you understand

10:38.105 --> 10:41.041
why we needed to have
this little chat.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.110
Yeah, well, blackmail
tends to get my attention.

10:43.110 --> 10:46.079
(Laughs)
Next question--

10:46.079 --> 10:48.115
Karen.
That's not a question.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.083
Actually, you know, um,

10:50.083 --> 10:54.054
I'm a little parched myself.

10:55.122 --> 10:58.025
Why not?

10:58.025 --> 11:01.995
So my sources tell me
that Karen nearly broke off

11:01.995 --> 11:04.064
her engagement
to billionaire Simon elder.

11:04.064 --> 11:07.000
There were a few bumps
along the road,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.002
but everything
is just fine now.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.104
In fact,
the wedding's next week.

11:11.104 --> 11:14.074
So it is true Karen's
tempestuous relationship

11:14.074 --> 11:16.076
with old flame Nick George

11:16.076 --> 11:18.078
nearly wrecked everything
for Simon and Karen?

11:18.078 --> 11:20.080
I think
you're a little mixed up

11:20.080 --> 11:22.082
on your specifics there,
Kate.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.985
There was an ex
stirring up trouble,

11:24.985 --> 11:26.086
but it wasn't Nick George.

11:26.086 --> 11:29.022
Hey, baby,
I think it's really sexy

11:29.022 --> 11:31.058
that you're a dad...

11:31.058 --> 11:33.060
But do I have to meet
your son?

11:33.060 --> 11:36.129
(Laughs) Elon is a great kid.
You'll love him.

11:36.129 --> 11:40.033
Rise up slowly.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.101
Maybe I'll buy him
something.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.102
Yeah?

11:42.102 --> 11:44.037
Like hot wheels.

11:44.037 --> 11:47.107
And now move into Navasana,
boat pose.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.042
He's 16 years old.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.045
Yeah, I know, but I can't give
a 16 year old boy

11:52.045 --> 11:56.016
what he really wants,
now can I?
Uh, no, you can't.

11:56.016 --> 11:59.019
Hey, did we pick a place
for lunch yet?

11:59.019 --> 12:02.022
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
my place, 2:00 P. M.

12:02.022 --> 12:05.125
Ama is gonna cook for us.
Your ex-wife is joining us?

12:05.125 --> 12:07.127
Yeah.
Fun. That's so--
that's so fun.

12:07.127 --> 12:10.030
Yeah. I thought it'd be
a good idea for you two

12:10.030 --> 12:12.032
to get to know
each other better,

12:12.032 --> 12:14.034
you know, for Elon's sake
and all.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.102
Yeah, I totally agree.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.070
Well, as you can imagine,

12:17.070 --> 12:21.074
this whole ama thing
wasnât sitting well with Karen.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.011
I'm happy to have lunch
with his son,

12:24.011 --> 12:26.079
but his ex-wife, too?

12:26.079 --> 12:28.048
Princess ama of wherever.

12:28.048 --> 12:31.018
Have you registered
your concerns with Simon?

12:31.018 --> 12:33.020
No, no.
It would be too weird.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.055
We were just getting out of
the boat position

12:35.055 --> 12:38.025
when he told me and...
Yoga, mom.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.092
Oh, yeah. I knew that.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.095
He just doesn't realize how
creepy and possessive she gets

12:42.095 --> 12:44.031
when she's around me.

12:44.031 --> 12:46.033
Well, Karen, if you and Simon
can overcome

12:46.033 --> 12:48.101
the emotional infidelities of
high-stakes corporate espionage,

12:48.101 --> 12:51.071
you can, you know,
talk this through.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.006
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.075
Just... just be delicate.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.077
So later that afternoon,

12:57.077 --> 13:00.013
Karen took
her mothers advice to heart

13:00.013 --> 13:02.082
and, uh, decided
to give Simon a call.
(Cell phone rings)

13:02.082 --> 13:04.017
Hey there.

13:04.017 --> 13:07.020
So listen, um, I was
sort of thinking about lunch,

13:07.020 --> 13:08.088
and--and...

13:08.088 --> 13:11.058
I think I wanted it
just to be the three of us--

13:11.058 --> 13:13.060
you know, you, me and elon.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.062
Yeah, I got you.
No problem.

13:15.062 --> 13:17.097
Dad, get off the phone.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.066
He doesn't sound 16.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.068
All right.
We'll see you tomorrow.

13:21.068 --> 13:23.070
Okay. Bye.
All right.

13:23.070 --> 13:26.073
Isn't that better?

13:26.073 --> 13:28.008
Yeah.

13:28.008 --> 13:31.078
So the next day, Simon,
Karen and elon met for lunch

13:31.078 --> 13:34.081
and that's when things got...

13:34.081 --> 13:36.116
Complicated.

13:36.116 --> 13:39.119
I want to go to either
Oxford or Cambridge.
What about the sorbonne?

13:39.119 --> 13:42.022
Les jolies filles tres sexy,
right?

13:42.022 --> 13:43.123
That'd be cool.

13:43.123 --> 13:46.026
I'm kind of into
continental philosophy.

13:46.026 --> 13:49.096
Yeah, but I'd like to keep him
just a little closer to home.

13:49.096 --> 13:51.999
Why? You always said
the world raised you, right?

13:51.999 --> 13:54.067
(Door opens and closes)

13:54.067 --> 13:55.068
Ama.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.004
Hi. I let myself in.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.006
Ama, hi. That's--
it's a surprise.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.074
I'm so sorry
I'm interrupting.

14:01.074 --> 14:04.044
Um, not at all.
Elon wanted to drive
with you later,

14:04.044 --> 14:06.079
and he forgot
his learner's permit.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.015
All right. Go.
Yes.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.116
(Laughs)
Ama...

14:09.116 --> 14:11.118
(Speaks foreign language)
(Whispers) Oh, my...

14:11.118 --> 14:13.053
(Speaks foreign language)

14:13.053 --> 14:15.055
Ah, yeah. Hey,
I'm gonna go make sure

14:15.055 --> 14:17.057
he doesn't back over
one of our valets.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.992
(Laughs)
I'll be right back. Mwah.

14:18.992 --> 14:22.095
Oh... (Mutters) Stay.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.031
(Sighs)

14:24.031 --> 14:26.033
(Door opens and closes)

14:26.033 --> 14:28.135
Well, you look beautiful.
Thank you, but no.

14:28.135 --> 14:33.006
I--I am here because I am
the mother of Simon's child.

14:33.006 --> 14:37.044
You are here because you...
Are beautiful.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.079
Beauty makes Simon very happy.

14:39.079 --> 14:43.016
We had great sex this morning.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.120
(Mouths words)
Three times.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.057
Ooh. Meow.
Don't quote me
on that last part,

14:50.057 --> 14:52.059
but you get the picture.

14:52.059 --> 14:55.028
So that's the whole story?

14:55.028 --> 14:57.064
Karen Darling has
a healthy sexual appetite?

14:57.064 --> 15:00.067
Oh, Clark. I thought
you were gonna cooperate.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.036
If that's all you've got--
did I say I was done?

15:03.036 --> 15:06.073
Now after Ama's
surprise drop by,

15:06.073 --> 15:09.042
Karen was plenty ticked off,

15:09.042 --> 15:12.012
but Simon
still didn't have a clue.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.080
Hey, Karen. It's Simon.

15:13.080 --> 15:16.016
Oh, hi. What do you want?

15:16.016 --> 15:18.118
I was hoping you would have
brunch with me this morning.

15:18.118 --> 15:21.021
Hoping
or are you asking?

15:21.021 --> 15:23.056
(Chuckles)
How does 10:00 work for you?

15:23.056 --> 15:25.025
Um, it doesn't really.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.094
Oh, but avoiding me does?

15:27.094 --> 15:30.998
Um, well, maybe I could
clear my schedule.

15:30.998 --> 15:34.034
Perfect. I told ama
we'd meet her at hyacinth.

15:34.034 --> 15:37.070
Oh. Oh! You mean
that ex-wife of yours

15:37.070 --> 15:39.072
that you're inappropriately
close to still?

15:39.072 --> 15:41.008
That ama? Her?

15:41.008 --> 15:42.075
Yeah, that's the one.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.011
You know what?

15:44.011 --> 15:46.013
I actually--I can't
clear my schedule 'cause see,

15:46.013 --> 15:48.115
I met this guy last night,
and we're having brunch.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.117
Mm-hmm.
It's gonna be me and him

15:50.117 --> 15:53.020
and, well, his ex-wife,
naturally, and his stepmother

15:53.020 --> 15:55.088
and this girl he had a crush on
in kindergarten.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.090
And I would love
to invite you along,

15:57.090 --> 16:00.060
but that would just be weird.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.062
(Kate) So what happened?

16:02.062 --> 16:04.064
How did Simon win her back?

16:04.064 --> 16:07.067
Have you ever met Simon elder
in person?

16:07.067 --> 16:09.002
No.

16:09.002 --> 16:11.104
Well... he is a charmer.

16:17.044 --> 16:20.047
Karen.
I know, I'm persistent.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.082
If by "persistent"
you mean "stalkerish," yes.

16:22.082 --> 16:26.019
How did you find me?
You wouldn't return my calls.
I got it.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.021
You gave me no other option.
Karen--

16:28.021 --> 16:31.024
what do you want? What?
I spoke to ama.

16:31.024 --> 16:34.027
Oh, is she upset
I broke up with us?

16:34.027 --> 16:36.096
Was she planning a cruise
or something?

16:36.096 --> 16:39.099
No. Ama and I are going to
limit our relationship.

16:39.099 --> 16:42.102
We're just gonna interact
when we have to,

16:42.102 --> 16:44.071
when we're co-parenting elon.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.106
You're gonna--you're gonna
do that because of me?

16:46.106 --> 16:48.108
There are reasons ama and I
aren't together.

16:48.108 --> 16:51.044
And you're the first woman
that I've cared about--

16:51.044 --> 16:55.048
I mean, really cared about--
in a long time.

16:57.050 --> 16:59.052
I don't know what to say.

16:59.052 --> 17:02.055
Then don't say anything...

17:02.055 --> 17:03.123
Yet.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.058
All right?

17:05.058 --> 17:07.027
Okay.

17:16.069 --> 17:19.039
So you see?
Nick had nothing to do

17:19.039 --> 17:21.040
with Karen and Simon's
wedding jitters.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.076
Now if you'll excuse me,

17:23.076 --> 17:25.112
I've got
a Thanksgiving Turkey to stuff.

17:25.112 --> 17:27.079
I'm sure you do,
but it's my understanding,

17:27.079 --> 17:30.017
that in the midst
of her murder trial,

17:30.017 --> 17:32.019
Letitia was arrested
for jumping bail

17:32.019 --> 17:34.054
and trying to flee
the country.

17:34.054 --> 17:37.057
Okay, that's just crazy.
Who's your source on that one?

17:37.057 --> 17:39.092
The booking officer
at the 19th precinct.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.995
Of course.

17:41.995 --> 17:44.064
From what I hear,

17:44.064 --> 17:46.066
Letitia made a run for it,

17:46.066 --> 17:50.003
which is
what guilty people do.

17:50.003 --> 17:52.072
Come on, Clark. Admit it.

17:52.072 --> 17:55.108
Letitia Darling's a murderer.

18:12.092 --> 18:15.062
I can clear all this up,
all right?

18:15.062 --> 18:16.129
During the trial,

18:16.129 --> 18:19.032
Mrs. Darling did have
some problems with her bail,

18:19.032 --> 18:21.034
but she never,
ever tried to flee.

18:21.034 --> 18:22.102
I'm all ears.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.137
When Mrs. Darling
was charged with murder,

18:24.137 --> 18:26.106
she was placed
under house arrest.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.108
Yeah, it sounds like
a real hardship,

18:28.108 --> 18:31.044
yeah--
having to stay cooped up
in the palace.

18:31.044 --> 18:34.047
You might not think so,
but after a while,

18:34.047 --> 18:37.985
Letitia started getting...
Restless.

18:37.985 --> 18:40.020
You cannot be out here,
Mrs. Darling.

18:40.020 --> 18:42.022
You're under house arrest.

18:42.022 --> 18:44.057
I need
my daily walk, Clark.

18:44.057 --> 18:45.993
And so does midas...

18:45.993 --> 18:48.061
For different reasons,
of course.

18:48.061 --> 18:50.063
(Laughs) I love the fall.

18:50.063 --> 18:54.034
It reminds me of,
oh, bonfires and apple picking--

18:54.034 --> 18:56.069
oh! And spring fashion
collections.

18:56.069 --> 18:58.071
I can't wait to see

18:58.071 --> 19:00.107
the Ferragamo
charity fashion show

19:00.107 --> 19:02.075
at the Waldorf next week.

19:02.075 --> 19:04.011
Fantastico.

19:04.011 --> 19:07.014
Ma'am, please, you are under
strict instructions

19:07.014 --> 19:09.049
not to leave the property.

19:09.049 --> 19:11.051
We own all the property
in the neighborhood.

19:11.051 --> 19:13.053
This is my home.

19:13.053 --> 19:14.121
(Siren wailing)

19:14.121 --> 19:16.123
Mrs. Darling,
maybe we should--

19:16.123 --> 19:19.126
Clark, that's a siren.
Pull over and make way.

19:19.126 --> 19:22.095
Yes, ma'am.

19:22.095 --> 19:24.131
(Tires squeal)

19:24.131 --> 19:27.067
(Man)
Hold it right there, ma'am.
Oh.

19:27.067 --> 19:29.136
71st and Madison.
We got her.
(Man) 10-4.

19:29.136 --> 19:31.071
Mrs. Darling.
I-I'm just walking
my dog.

19:31.071 --> 19:34.041
Step away from the dog
and put your hands in the air.

19:34.041 --> 19:37.044
I give up.
Mrs. Darling
was under arrest.

19:37.044 --> 19:38.045
Again?

19:38.045 --> 19:40.047
Let's just say,
it's moments like these

19:40.047 --> 19:42.115
where Nick George
really earns his money.

19:42.115 --> 19:44.117
I got
your probation officer

19:44.117 --> 19:47.054
to release you
with a warning.
(Scoffs)

19:47.054 --> 19:49.056
But if you leave
the house again

19:49.056 --> 19:51.058
for anything other
than court-related reasons,

19:51.058 --> 19:53.994
you're gonna sit in jail
for the duration of the trial.

19:53.994 --> 19:56.029
Mm. Thank you, Alicia.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.031
Well, I guess it's 5:00
somewhere, huh?

19:58.031 --> 19:59.099
Nick...

19:59.099 --> 20:03.070
I was just put in a police car
for walking my dog.

20:03.070 --> 20:05.105
I've earned
a fortifying cocktail.

20:05.105 --> 20:08.041
And I, having taken this case
at your request,

20:08.041 --> 20:10.043
have earned
a little cooperation.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.045
Do you understand
the rules or not?

20:12.045 --> 20:13.113
Truthfully, no.

20:13.113 --> 20:15.115
What do they think
I'm gonna do,

20:15.115 --> 20:18.051
run off somewhere?
(Chuckles)

20:18.051 --> 20:20.120
I'm a Darling.
Where could I hide?

20:20.120 --> 20:22.122
Look, I know it's nerve-racking
being confined here,

20:22.122 --> 20:24.091
but you have to stay
in the house.

20:24.091 --> 20:26.093
Clark.
Yes, sir.

20:26.093 --> 20:29.062
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.031
She can't leave.
No, sir.

20:31.031 --> 20:33.000
God! Unh!

20:33.000 --> 20:36.069
I was so looking forward
to that fashion show.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.105
Ah! I feel like
I'm under arrest.

20:38.105 --> 20:41.041
You are.

20:41.041 --> 20:44.077
I know,
but now I feel that way.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.013
(Sighs)

20:46.013 --> 20:48.015
Nick, could you get me
the number

20:48.015 --> 20:50.083
for the folks at Ferragamo?

20:50.083 --> 20:51.118
Why?

20:51.118 --> 20:53.120
Well... if I can't go
to the collection,

20:53.120 --> 20:56.023
I'll bring it here.

20:56.023 --> 20:59.092
If I invite all my friends,
they can't say no.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.061
I'm their biggest client.

21:01.061 --> 21:03.096
Is that within the law?

21:03.096 --> 21:06.066
I will see what I can do.

21:06.066 --> 21:08.101
As the fashion show approached,

21:08.101 --> 21:10.103
Mrs. Darling got more
and more excited.

21:10.103 --> 21:13.006
It was good to see her
back to her old self.

21:13.006 --> 21:14.074
I'm thinking the runway

21:14.074 --> 21:17.077
can stretch right through
the center of the gallery.

21:17.077 --> 21:19.012
Hi, Darling.

21:19.012 --> 21:20.080
Or maybe the living room.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.015
Oh, you're seriously

21:22.015 --> 21:24.017
putting a fashion show on
here tomorrow?

21:24.017 --> 21:26.019
Well, Ferragamo agreed to it.

21:26.019 --> 21:28.088
They're sending over
their spring collection

21:28.088 --> 21:30.023
and their models,

21:30.023 --> 21:33.126
and I've invited
200 of my closest friends

21:33.126 --> 21:35.128
and their daughters
and their daughters.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.130
The city of New York

21:37.130 --> 21:40.033
can imprison me
in my own home,

21:40.033 --> 21:42.069
but they can't
slow me down.

21:42.069 --> 21:44.037
You'll come?

21:44.037 --> 21:45.072
I will try.

21:45.072 --> 21:47.074
It sounds like
a real situation.
Well...

21:47.074 --> 21:49.109
The day of the show,
things got a little...

21:49.109 --> 21:51.111
Busy around here,

21:51.111 --> 21:53.113
and not necessarily
in a bad way.

21:53.113 --> 21:55.115
(Women laugh)

21:55.115 --> 21:57.084
Hi. (Sighs)

21:57.084 --> 21:59.086
Can we change in here?

22:01.021 --> 22:03.090
N-no.

22:03.090 --> 22:05.025
Sorry. (Laughs)

22:05.025 --> 22:07.094
(Laughing)

22:07.094 --> 22:08.996
(Door closes)

22:08.996 --> 22:12.065
Everything had been planned
to the letter.

22:12.065 --> 22:14.067
The only problem--
when the big moment arrived,

22:14.067 --> 22:15.135
it just wasnât that big.

22:15.135 --> 22:17.070
(Knock on door)

22:17.070 --> 22:20.040
Oh, I know, I know.
I'm late.

22:20.040 --> 22:22.109
It took longer than usual.

22:22.109 --> 22:24.044
Imprisonment fatigues me.

22:24.044 --> 22:27.047
Well, maybe you should
get some rest then.

22:27.047 --> 22:29.049
And miss my big production?
Never.

22:29.049 --> 22:31.051
11.

22:31.051 --> 22:34.021
11 what? What do you mean?

22:34.021 --> 22:36.023
11 of your friends came.

22:36.023 --> 22:38.025
Why would there
only be...

22:40.027 --> 22:42.996
Oh.

22:42.996 --> 22:45.098
Sycophant suck wads.

22:45.098 --> 22:48.035
(Sighs)

22:52.105 --> 22:54.107
I'm sorry.

22:54.107 --> 22:56.076
(Kate) I almost

22:56.076 --> 22:59.046
feel sorry for Letitia.

22:59.046 --> 23:01.081
Then don't run the story.

23:01.081 --> 23:04.051
I said
I almost feel sorry.

23:04.051 --> 23:05.118
Of course.

23:05.118 --> 23:09.022
So... did she call off
the fashion show?

23:09.022 --> 23:12.092
You clearly don't know
Letitia Darling.

23:12.092 --> 23:16.997
I refuse to let those boo birds
darken my mood.

23:16.997 --> 23:20.067
Come on. Let's go see
the pretty ladies.

23:20.067 --> 23:24.004
(The ting tings shut up
and let me go playing)

23:29.009 --> 23:31.011
? Shut up and let me go ?

23:31.011 --> 23:33.046
? This hurts,
but I cant show ?

23:33.046 --> 23:36.016
? For the last time,
you had me in bits ?

23:36.016 --> 23:38.085
? Now shut up and let me go,
hey! ?

23:45.058 --> 23:48.095
? Oh ?

23:48.095 --> 23:50.097
? Love ?

23:50.097 --> 23:53.033
? Hold ?

23:53.033 --> 23:55.002
? This ?

23:55.002 --> 23:58.038
Ah, well.

23:58.038 --> 24:01.108
That was lovely,
wasn't it?

24:01.108 --> 24:04.111
My deepest thanks
to Ferragamo

24:04.111 --> 24:08.015
and... and to all of you
for daring--

24:08.015 --> 24:10.017
Letitia Darling,

24:10.017 --> 24:13.020
those clothes...
Ah, oh, things of beauty,

24:13.020 --> 24:15.022
marvels, really.

24:15.022 --> 24:19.092
But your
unwholesome behavior

24:19.092 --> 24:21.128
and the attention
that it's invited,

24:21.128 --> 24:23.096
well... (Inhales sharply)

24:23.096 --> 24:25.999
It's cast a shadow
over the lives

24:25.999 --> 24:28.001
of all women of substance,

24:28.001 --> 24:31.038
and for that,
I really think...

24:31.038 --> 24:33.040
You should be ashamed.

24:41.081 --> 24:44.017
(Women gasp and scream)

25:03.070 --> 25:06.106
Letitia collapsed...
On the catwalk?

25:06.106 --> 25:08.075
She was dehydrated.

25:08.075 --> 25:11.044
Naturally, we rushed her
across town to the doctor,

25:11.044 --> 25:14.047
and that's when
D. A. Nola lyons showed up,

25:14.047 --> 25:16.049
ready to send Mrs. Darling
back to the big house.

25:16.049 --> 25:19.052
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

25:19.052 --> 25:20.120
Thank you.

25:20.120 --> 25:22.990
She violated
house arrest again.

25:22.990 --> 25:24.091
I'm taking her into custody.

25:24.091 --> 25:26.093
Necessity
is an affirmative defense

25:26.093 --> 25:28.095
where a life is at stake.

25:28.095 --> 25:31.064
My client needed
emergency medical attention.
At a rejuvenation center?

25:31.064 --> 25:33.066
This is
a glorified spa treatment.

25:33.066 --> 25:37.070
My wife was lucky
she blacked out on a catwalk.

25:37.070 --> 25:40.040
What would've happened if she'd
been on the grand staircase?

25:40.040 --> 25:42.109
I'll make sure there are
no stairs in her jail cell.

25:42.109 --> 25:45.045
Your wife is done flouting
her home confinement. Officers.

25:45.045 --> 25:47.114
If you're referring to
the dog walking incident,

25:47.114 --> 25:49.116
the term "home"
includes curtilage--

25:49.116 --> 25:52.019
any grounds
that are part of a dwelling.

25:52.019 --> 25:54.021
Since the Darlings own
their entire block,

25:54.021 --> 25:57.057
it's all curtilage, and legally,
a part of their home.
That's what I told them!

25:57.057 --> 25:59.026
So if you arrest
my client now,

25:59.026 --> 26:01.061
I will have
malicious prosecution charges

26:01.061 --> 26:04.097
filed against your office faster
than you can say "mistrial."
Hmm.

26:04.097 --> 26:07.100
Letitia wasnât jumping bail.

26:07.100 --> 26:10.070
She was just having
one of her... spells.

26:10.070 --> 26:14.007
You have an explanation
for just about everything,

26:14.007 --> 26:16.109
don't you?
It helps
when you're telling the truth.

26:16.109 --> 26:19.012
(Crunching)

26:19.012 --> 26:22.049
You're kinda cute,
you know that?

26:22.049 --> 26:24.051
Yes, I suppose I do.

26:24.051 --> 26:26.086
(Keys click)

26:28.088 --> 26:30.090
What's up
with the mustache?

26:33.026 --> 26:35.062
Let's just stick
to the article.

26:35.062 --> 26:37.097
Okay.

26:37.097 --> 26:41.101
Where is Juliet Darling?
Vacation.

26:41.101 --> 26:44.071
For an entire year?
She's chosen
a life of leisure.

26:44.071 --> 26:46.073
I've got a line
on a story

26:46.073 --> 26:49.009
that Tripp Darling
bought his daughter

26:49.009 --> 26:51.011
a padded suite
at Payne Whitney psychiatric

26:51.011 --> 26:54.014
when she woke up one morning
convinced she was yogi berra.

26:54.014 --> 26:57.084
(Laughs)

26:57.084 --> 26:59.052
Okay.

26:59.052 --> 27:01.054
Juliet is with a boy.

27:01.054 --> 27:04.124
What boy?
A boy she met while she was
on vacation in the Seychelles.

27:04.124 --> 27:06.126
I need a name.
Kai.

27:06.126 --> 27:09.062
You're kidding me.

27:09.062 --> 27:12.032
No.
He's a real sweet kid, too.

27:12.032 --> 27:14.101
Look, all the trouble started
when Juliet decided

27:14.101 --> 27:18.005
she was finally ready
to lose her virginity with kai.

27:18.005 --> 27:20.040
All right.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.075
I'm listening.

27:22.075 --> 27:24.077
Tonight's the night.

27:26.046 --> 27:28.015
Tonight?

27:30.017 --> 27:32.085
I've waited 25 years

27:32.085 --> 27:35.022
for the right guy...

27:35.022 --> 27:38.025
And the right moment.

27:38.025 --> 27:41.028
And tonight, I'll have both.

27:41.028 --> 27:43.063
You sure?

27:43.063 --> 27:45.065
Positive.

27:48.101 --> 27:51.004
Okay, wait a sec.
(Beeps)

27:51.004 --> 27:54.041
Jealous African princesses?
Okay.

27:54.041 --> 27:56.043
Showdowns with mobsters?
Maybe.

27:56.043 --> 27:59.046
But Juliet Darling a virgin?
Come on.

27:59.046 --> 28:03.016
Look, do you want to hear
what happened, or don't you?

28:03.016 --> 28:04.084
(Beep)
Keep going.

28:04.084 --> 28:06.987
Well,
like most young ladies,

28:06.987 --> 28:08.989
Juliet
was still plenty nervous.

28:08.989 --> 28:11.992
So she decided to get
all the girls together

28:11.992 --> 28:14.061
to swap stories
about their first times.

28:14.061 --> 28:16.029
Oh, it was so incredible.

28:16.029 --> 28:18.098
It was very... adventurous.

28:18.098 --> 28:22.069
Do I really want to hear this?
Oh, let her tell.
I want to know.

28:22.069 --> 28:25.005
Okay, my first time...
All right.

28:25.005 --> 28:27.040
It was one of those hot,
muggy nights, central park.

28:27.040 --> 28:30.110
We were naked.
You were naked
in central park? Where?

28:30.110 --> 28:34.081
I swore to Nick I wouldn't tell.
It's our little secret.
Did you, you know?

28:34.081 --> 28:36.116
Oh, my lord,
I don't want to know.
I do!

28:36.116 --> 28:39.086
Oh, of course, yes, yeah,
but we had to be very quiet

28:39.086 --> 28:41.021
because there were
people around.

28:41.021 --> 28:43.090
And, sweetie, that doesn't
always happen to everyone.

28:43.090 --> 28:45.058
Oh.

28:45.058 --> 28:47.094
Okay, Natalie?

28:47.094 --> 28:49.096
I did it
with the pool boy

28:49.096 --> 28:53.000
at our house in palm Springs.
(Laughs)

28:53.000 --> 28:55.002
We kind of had
this thing all summer,

28:55.002 --> 28:57.104
and it was very, um...

28:57.104 --> 28:59.106
Colonial?
Mm. Mm-hmm.

28:59.106 --> 29:02.009
Oh, I love that.

29:02.009 --> 29:04.077
Well, what about you,
Mrs. Darling?

29:04.077 --> 29:07.047
You know, I'm not sure
that I want to indulge

29:07.047 --> 29:11.084
in this, uh, in this
particular roundtable.

29:11.084 --> 29:13.086
Mom, this is
a valuable opportunity

29:13.086 --> 29:16.056
for me to learn
from my female peers.

29:16.056 --> 29:18.992
I need the wisdom
of my tribal sisters

29:18.992 --> 29:20.093
and mother.

29:20.093 --> 29:22.029
(Sighs)

29:22.029 --> 29:24.031
Well...

29:24.031 --> 29:28.101
It was my wedding night,
and, uh...

29:28.101 --> 29:31.004
It was very sweet.

29:31.004 --> 29:33.073
Your wedding night?
(Laughs)

29:33.073 --> 29:36.076
That's--oh, my God, mom.
Tell the truth.

29:36.076 --> 29:38.011
It was my wedding night,

29:38.011 --> 29:40.013
and that's all
I'm gonna say about it.

29:40.013 --> 29:42.082
So... did Juliet
go through with it?

29:42.082 --> 29:44.985
Well...

29:44.985 --> 29:48.088
Yeah, she did.

29:48.088 --> 29:50.090
Mm. (Laughs)

29:50.090 --> 29:51.091
(Sighs)

29:51.091 --> 29:53.026
(Sighs)

29:53.026 --> 29:55.095
Oh.

29:55.095 --> 29:58.031
How was that?

29:58.031 --> 30:00.033
Good.

30:00.033 --> 30:02.035
Just good?

30:02.035 --> 30:04.104
(Chuckles) Oh. Great.

30:04.104 --> 30:07.107
Oh, kai.

30:07.107 --> 30:09.109
I feel like...

30:09.109 --> 30:11.111
You and I
just sang a song

30:11.111 --> 30:14.047
that no one's
ever heard before,

30:14.047 --> 30:16.049
and you and I
are the only ones

30:16.049 --> 30:18.051
who will ever know it.

30:18.051 --> 30:20.053
(Laughs)
You're so sweet.

30:20.053 --> 30:21.088
(Laughs)

30:21.088 --> 30:23.090
Mm.

30:23.090 --> 30:25.025
Oh.

30:25.025 --> 30:26.093
(Cell phone rings)

30:26.093 --> 30:27.094
Mm.

30:27.094 --> 30:28.095
(Ringing)

30:28.095 --> 30:30.030
I have to get that.

30:30.030 --> 30:32.065
What? No.
W-what are you doing?

30:32.065 --> 30:34.067
We haven't even
finished cuddling yet.

30:34.067 --> 30:36.103
(Beep)
I have to go out
for a while.

30:36.103 --> 30:38.105
Who is that?

30:38.105 --> 30:40.073
Just a friend.

30:40.073 --> 30:42.009
I'll be back.

30:42.009 --> 30:44.044
Well... kai, you know,

30:44.044 --> 30:47.080
if I'm doing something wrong,
y-you'd tell me, right?

30:47.080 --> 30:49.016
(Works zipper)

30:49.016 --> 30:51.084
Of course.

30:51.084 --> 30:53.120
It was perfect.

30:53.120 --> 30:57.057
I'll see you later,
okay?

31:00.027 --> 31:03.096
(Kate) Juliet Darling--
bad in bed?

31:03.096 --> 31:05.098
You think
this is about sex?

31:05.098 --> 31:08.035
Isn't it?
No.

31:08.035 --> 31:09.069
This is about kai

31:09.069 --> 31:12.105
and the very big secret
he was keeping.

31:21.014 --> 31:23.050
(Clark) When kai got home
later that day,

31:23.050 --> 31:25.052
Juliet decided
to play it cool.

31:25.052 --> 31:26.119
Hey.

31:26.119 --> 31:28.055
Are you okay?

31:28.055 --> 31:30.057
Where have you been?

31:30.057 --> 31:33.060
I told you
I had something to do.
Something or someone?

31:33.060 --> 31:37.030
What?
Were you with another girl,
someone more experienced?

31:37.030 --> 31:38.098
Just tell me.

31:38.098 --> 31:40.100
No, I wasn't.
Juliet, you're being crazy.

31:40.100 --> 31:42.102
'Cause I think you're
keeping secrets from me,

31:42.102 --> 31:44.104
and that is not sexy.

31:44.104 --> 31:48.108
Quoi? What--hey, uh--
wait. Come back.

31:48.108 --> 31:50.043
So Juliet went to talk

31:50.043 --> 31:52.112
to the one person
a young lady goes to

31:52.112 --> 31:54.114
when shes feeling
a little confused.

31:54.114 --> 31:57.117
Darling, are you--
are you okay?

31:57.117 --> 31:59.119
It's kai.

31:59.119 --> 32:02.990
Oh, he's--he's such
a lovely boy.

32:02.990 --> 32:03.991
(Sighs)

32:03.991 --> 32:05.058
What's wrong?

32:05.058 --> 32:07.127
It's about...

32:07.127 --> 32:09.096
Sex.

32:09.096 --> 32:11.064
Oh. Oh.

32:11.064 --> 32:14.067
I'm not very good at it.
Oh.

32:14.067 --> 32:16.003
Do you have any advice?

32:16.003 --> 32:18.071
Oh, sex?

32:18.071 --> 32:22.009
Of course. Sex.

32:22.009 --> 32:23.076
(Stammers) You know,

32:23.076 --> 32:27.080
sex is like riding a horse.

32:27.080 --> 32:29.016
First you just--

32:29.016 --> 32:31.051
oh, you fall in love
with the horse.

32:31.051 --> 32:33.086
And then you get to know
the horse,

32:33.086 --> 32:38.025
and then you learn
to jump it, higher and higher,

32:38.025 --> 32:39.993
and then you,

32:39.993 --> 32:42.996
oh, you take all these
wonderful adventures with it.

32:42.996 --> 32:45.132
But you have to become one

32:45.132 --> 32:50.003
with your horse.

32:50.003 --> 32:51.071
Uh...

32:51.071 --> 32:54.007
My advice is,

32:54.007 --> 32:55.075
uh...

32:55.075 --> 32:58.111
Practice, practice,
practice.

32:58.111 --> 33:01.014
(Laughs)

33:01.014 --> 33:03.016
Oh.

33:03.016 --> 33:05.085
(Instrumental jazz playing)

33:05.085 --> 33:07.087
(Slow piano music playing)

33:07.087 --> 33:09.056
Later that night,

33:09.056 --> 33:12.092
kai decided to lay
all his cards on the table.

33:14.995 --> 33:17.998
Juliet...

33:17.998 --> 33:20.133
I know you're angry,
and...

33:20.133 --> 33:22.102
I came to apologize.

33:22.102 --> 33:24.104
Sorry is not
good enough, kai.

33:24.104 --> 33:26.039
You're not communicating,

33:26.039 --> 33:27.107
you're keeping secrets
from me,

33:27.107 --> 33:30.077
and you're making me feel--
shh, shh, shh.

33:30.077 --> 33:32.012
You're right, okay?

33:32.012 --> 33:36.016
I shouldn't have hid from you
what I was doing today.

33:36.016 --> 33:40.053
I guess part of me wasn't
ready to trust you, but...

33:40.053 --> 33:43.056
I'm ready now.
Trust me about what?

33:43.056 --> 33:46.093
The night we met...

33:46.093 --> 33:49.062
I told you my Uncle was
a village fisherman.

33:49.062 --> 33:51.098
You were okay with that
because you said

33:51.098 --> 33:53.100
you wanted to meet
somebody different,

33:53.100 --> 33:57.104
but... the truth is,

33:57.104 --> 34:00.107
my Uncle is...
Jean-Pierre Desjardins,

34:00.107 --> 34:04.077
the former president
of the Coquilles islands.

34:04.077 --> 34:07.080
No way.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.081
Yes way.

34:09.081 --> 34:11.083
Unfortunately,
my Uncle's prime minister

34:11.083 --> 34:13.020
led a coup d'Ã©tat

34:13.020 --> 34:15.121
and took the government away
from him and the people.

34:15.121 --> 34:17.123
L-l--coup d--

34:17.123 --> 34:19.126
oh, that sounds awful.

34:19.126 --> 34:22.029
I vowed to my Uncle

34:22.029 --> 34:24.031
that I would restore him
to power.

34:24.031 --> 34:26.099
And that's where I was
this afternoon--

34:26.099 --> 34:29.036
meeting with one of
his friends, a diplomat,

34:29.036 --> 34:31.004
who is going to help us.

34:31.004 --> 34:33.106
Wow.

34:33.106 --> 34:36.009
Oh, kai.

34:36.009 --> 34:39.079
Oh, kai.

34:41.081 --> 34:44.016
Telling the truth
is so erotic.

34:44.016 --> 34:45.085
Flush with love,
Juliet decided

34:45.085 --> 34:48.088
she had to help kai
and the freedom fighters

34:48.088 --> 34:50.056
liberate the Coquilles islands,

34:50.056 --> 34:52.059
so the next day...
(Cell phone ringing)

34:52.059 --> 34:54.061
Jeremy got a phone call.
(Beep)

34:54.061 --> 34:56.029
Jeremy.
Jules.

34:56.029 --> 34:58.031
You okay? I've been
worried sick about you.

34:58.031 --> 35:01.068
I have called you,
like, a million times.
I don't have my phone.
I don't need it anymore.

35:01.068 --> 35:03.003
What? Where are you?

35:03.003 --> 35:05.005
I'm at the airport...

35:05.005 --> 35:08.008
Waiting for my plane.
What? No, no.
You have to come back.

35:08.008 --> 35:11.011
I love you, Jeremy, but I have
more than you to worry about.

35:11.011 --> 35:13.046
The world's falling apart
at the seams and...

35:13.046 --> 35:16.016
Well, I'm going to
the Coquilles islands

35:16.016 --> 35:17.985
to try and stop it.
What?

35:17.985 --> 35:21.989
It's a revolution, Jeremy.
We're trying to restore justice.

35:21.989 --> 35:24.057
Juliet.
(Barks)

35:24.057 --> 35:25.125
Okay.

35:25.125 --> 35:28.996
Um, I gotta go.
My--my plane's about to board.

35:28.996 --> 35:31.064
No! Wait!
Jeremy Darling...

35:31.064 --> 35:34.067
You are my best friend
in the whole world,

35:34.067 --> 35:36.136
and I'm gonna miss you
so much.

35:36.136 --> 35:39.006
Juliet...

35:39.006 --> 35:42.009
I love you.
Au revoir, mon frere.

35:42.009 --> 35:43.110
(Airplane engine roars)

35:43.110 --> 35:45.045
(Kate) Wow.

35:45.045 --> 35:48.081
Is Juliet ever going to
come back home?
That's classified...

35:48.081 --> 35:50.050
For military reasons.

35:50.050 --> 35:53.053
Speaking of classified,
I am having a really hard time

35:53.053 --> 35:55.055
getting my hands on

35:55.055 --> 35:57.024
a mysteriously
unaired interview

35:57.024 --> 35:59.026
that Patrick Darling
gave to Dan rather

35:59.026 --> 36:01.061
just before the debate.

36:01.061 --> 36:02.996
Care to comment

36:02.996 --> 36:05.065
on why the network
decided not to run it?

36:05.065 --> 36:07.000
Better story
probably came along.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.037
Maybe Britney flashed
her nether region that day.

36:10.037 --> 36:12.039
Maybe, but, um,

36:12.039 --> 36:15.075
we've contacted people
involved with the interview

36:15.075 --> 36:18.011
who confirm that
the network shelved it

36:18.011 --> 36:21.048
because Mr. rather
asked Patrick...

36:21.048 --> 36:23.016
Uncomfortable questions.

36:23.016 --> 36:24.985
About what?

36:24.985 --> 36:29.022
About the night Ellen Darling
"accidentally" died in the fire.

36:29.022 --> 36:31.058
What did Patrick say
in that interview?

36:31.058 --> 36:34.995
Did he confess
to killing his wife?

36:47.007 --> 36:49.076
You have
some fanciful ideas

36:49.076 --> 36:53.013
about how far the power
of this family extends.

36:53.013 --> 36:55.015
You think the Darlings
could keep a lid

36:55.015 --> 36:57.050
on a taped murder confession?

36:57.050 --> 36:59.052
Fine. I'll just run
the Ellen story

36:59.052 --> 37:01.121
with your denial
and possible involvement.

37:01.121 --> 37:03.056
Oh, wait.

37:03.056 --> 37:06.059
Did you say
the Dan rather interview?

37:06.059 --> 37:08.128
Starting to
come back to you, Clark?

37:08.128 --> 37:10.998
Yeah. Yeah.

37:10.998 --> 37:14.067
That interview was...
A little uncomfortable.

37:14.067 --> 37:18.071
But... it didn't have anything
to do with Ellen's death.

37:18.071 --> 37:21.041
It was about a book.

37:23.076 --> 37:26.079
Renata Lennox.
Darling family publicist.

37:26.079 --> 37:29.016
Not Patrick Darling.
And what about your mom?

37:29.016 --> 37:30.117
What about her?

37:30.117 --> 37:33.987
She needs to be rescued,
thanks to this.

37:33.987 --> 37:37.090
I... I wrote that book
many years ago.

37:37.090 --> 37:40.093
Well, and some reporter today
dug up quotes from it

37:40.093 --> 37:42.129
about, how'd you put it,

37:42.129 --> 37:44.998
your mother's
"passionate fury"?

37:44.998 --> 37:48.035
Something like that, yeah.
That kind of
salacious sound bite

37:48.035 --> 37:50.037
takes on a whole new meaning

37:50.037 --> 37:52.072
under the glare
of murder charges.
(Sighs)

37:52.072 --> 37:54.107
Your father wants you
to start the spin cycle.

37:54.107 --> 37:57.010
I have a press schedule
all laid out.

37:57.010 --> 37:59.012
(Clark) Patrick was more
than willing to defend

37:59.012 --> 38:01.014
his unfortunate choice
of words in the book.

38:01.014 --> 38:03.984
I'll have to
get back to you on that.
There was only one problem--

38:03.984 --> 38:05.986
they werenât his words
to begin with.

38:05.986 --> 38:07.988
"Government censorship
of the arts

38:07.988 --> 38:10.023
"evoked my mother's
passionate fury.

38:10.023 --> 38:12.025
"And so she fought
for all of us,

38:12.025 --> 38:14.027
"but especially you, rodin,

38:14.027 --> 38:15.095
"and you, carpeaux,

38:15.095 --> 38:17.998
with your gypsy dancers."

38:17.998 --> 38:19.066
(Chuckles)

38:19.066 --> 38:21.068
So you see, Dan,
this "passionate fury"

38:21.068 --> 38:23.070
that everyone's making
such a fuss over

38:23.070 --> 38:26.039
had nothing to do
with violence.

38:26.039 --> 38:28.075
It was about her support
of artistic freedom.

38:28.075 --> 38:30.077
And her passion
for Parisian sculpture.

38:30.077 --> 38:33.046
Sickening how these things
can be taken out of context,

38:33.046 --> 38:35.048
isn't it?

38:35.048 --> 38:37.050
It's a plague, Dan,
truly.

38:37.050 --> 38:40.053
In the book, I was
touched by your reaction

38:40.053 --> 38:43.056
to your Uncle Kenneth's
assassination.

38:43.056 --> 38:46.026
To console you,
your mother gave you a kitten.

38:46.026 --> 38:48.996
That's right. Snowball.

38:48.996 --> 38:50.030
No.

38:50.030 --> 38:52.099
You said it was named after
Caesar Trunzo.

38:52.099 --> 38:54.101
You swore you'd name
all your cats

38:54.101 --> 38:56.103
after New York senators.

38:59.006 --> 39:01.008
(Chuckles) Well, there were
so many cats--

39:01.008 --> 39:03.010
Talmadge, Wadsworth, Javits.

39:03.010 --> 39:05.012
There were a lot of senators,

39:05.012 --> 39:08.015
but I've never met one
named snowball.

39:08.015 --> 39:11.051
You didn't write this book,
did you, Mr. Darling?

39:13.120 --> 39:16.123
So the Darlings buried
the rather interview

39:16.123 --> 39:18.091
to protect
senator Patrick Darling

39:18.091 --> 39:21.028
from a book scandal?

39:21.028 --> 39:23.030
(Sighs) Oh, well,
it's not exactly

39:23.030 --> 39:25.065
the article
I came here looking for.

39:25.065 --> 39:29.102
Still, the newly elected
junior senator of New York--

39:29.102 --> 39:32.005
a plagiarist?

39:32.005 --> 39:33.073
That'll do.

39:33.073 --> 39:35.075
Wait. Wait. You--

39:35.075 --> 39:37.077
you can't print
that story.

39:37.077 --> 39:40.013
Hey, I-I told you this
in confidence.

39:40.013 --> 39:43.016
This wasn't in our deal.
We never had a deal.
Sorry.

39:43.016 --> 39:45.018
Wait,
you're making a mistake.

39:45.018 --> 39:46.987
Is that a threat?
No. No.

39:46.987 --> 39:50.023
Look, you--you can print
these stories, sure.

39:50.023 --> 39:53.026
But do you have any idea
the kind of front-page scandals

39:53.026 --> 39:55.062
that go on in this place,

39:55.062 --> 39:57.998
the kind of stuff
that careers are made of?

39:57.998 --> 40:00.133
I--I'll tell you what,
I will make you a deal.

40:00.133 --> 40:03.003
Go on.

40:03.003 --> 40:05.105
I can be your source.
Just keep quiet on these,

40:05.105 --> 40:08.008
and I will feed you
the good stuff as it comes.

40:08.008 --> 40:10.043
Really?

40:10.043 --> 40:12.112
Would I lie to you?

40:15.082 --> 40:19.052
Sounds like
a win-win situation.

40:22.022 --> 40:24.057
(Elevator bell dings)

40:26.026 --> 40:27.094
We'll talk soon.

40:27.094 --> 40:29.997
You bet.

40:31.098 --> 40:33.033
Oh, and, Clark,

40:33.033 --> 40:35.102
happy Thanksgiving.

40:35.102 --> 40:37.104
Happy Thanksgiving.

40:37.104 --> 40:39.006
(Ding)

40:50.050 --> 40:52.085
(Tripp) The Fantini brothers
have a long

40:52.085 --> 40:55.088
and tempestuous history
with us.
(Nick) ... testify in
the Fantini brothers case.

40:55.088 --> 40:57.090
(Patrick) Obstruction of
justice--thatâs a felony.

40:57.090 --> 41:00.060
(Brian) Why donât you want
to testify?
(Nick) Theyâre mobsters, Brian.

41:00.060 --> 41:02.029
Mi a little parched myself.
First question...
The Fantini brothers...

41:02.029 --> 41:04.064
... talk to these
Fantini brothers.
The Fantini brothers...

41:04.064 --> 41:06.066
(Tripp) All of their
foul corruptions...

41:06.066 --> 41:08.101
Ethically pristine.
(Patrick) My, how, uh,
things have changed.

41:08.101 --> 41:11.071
(Clark) You have no proof
of anything.
But do I have to meet your son?

41:11.071 --> 41:14.041
Elon is a great kid.
Youâll love him.
... a 16 year old boy
what he really wants.

41:14.041 --> 41:16.043
(Letitia) Princess ama
of wherever.
(Clark) A few bumps
along the road.

41:16.043 --> 41:18.111
(Karen) He doesnât sound 16.
Donât quote me
on that last part,

41:18.111 --> 41:21.048
but you get the picture.
(Letitia) I cant wait to see

41:21.048 --> 41:23.116
the Ferragamo
charity fashion show.
I was so looking forward
to that fashion show.

41:23.116 --> 41:26.086
Could you get me the number
for the folks at Ferragamo?

41:26.086 --> 41:29.089
Mi their biggest client.
(Clark) You clearly
donât know Letitia Darling.

41:29.089 --> 41:31.124
(Nick) She cant leave.
Clark, do you understand?
(Kate) Come on, Clark.
Admit it.

41:31.124 --> 41:33.093
(Clark) Yes, sir.
I almost feel sorry
for Letitia.

41:33.093 --> 41:36.063
Then donât run the story.
Letitia Darlings a murderer.

41:36.063 --> 41:38.065
I can clear all this up.
Where is Juliet Darling?

41:38.065 --> 41:41.001
(Juliet) Jeremy...
Juliet is with a boy.

41:41.001 --> 41:44.037
My Uncle
is Jean-Pierre Desjardins...
This is about kai and the big
secret he was keeping.

41:44.037 --> 41:46.006
Former president
of the Coquilles islands.

41:46.006 --> 41:48.075
... and took the government...
(Kate) Is Juliet
ever going to come back home?

41:48.075 --> 41:51.078
(Clark) Thatâs classified.
(Kate) I am having a really
hard time getting my hands...

41:51.078 --> 41:54.014
(Renata) Passionate fury...
On a mysteriously
unaired interview

41:54.014 --> 41:56.083
that Patrick Darling
gave to Dan rather

41:56.083 --> 41:59.019
just before the debate.
... uncomfortable questions.

41:59.019 --> 42:01.088
(Patrick) Snowball.
Did it work?

42:01.088 --> 42:04.024
Like a charm.

42:05.993 --> 42:09.062
(Telephone rings)

42:09.062 --> 42:13.066
(Ring)

42:13.066 --> 42:17.104
(Ring)

42:17.104 --> 42:19.039
(Beep)

42:19.039 --> 42:20.107
Hello.

42:20.107 --> 42:23.110
Oh, hello, Mr. Darling.

42:23.110 --> 42:25.112
No. Everything's
been quiet around here.

42:25.112 --> 42:29.116
Nothing to worry about, sir.
You just enjoy the holiday.

42:29.116 --> 42:31.084
Happy Thanksgiving
to you as well,

42:31.084 --> 42:33.120
and to the family.

42:33.120 --> 42:36.023
Good night, Mr. Darling.

42:36.023 --> 42:37.824
(Beep)
