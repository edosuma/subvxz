WEBVTT

00:01.560 --> 00:03.198
- Previously on Being Human...

00:03.230 --> 00:06.029
- My brother had
a nervous breakdown

00:06.070 --> 00:07.560
and ran away
from his family.

00:07.600 --> 00:08.999
(Roaring)

00:09.040 --> 00:10.906
- Just leave me alone.

00:10.940 --> 00:13.409
- You screw me. You kill me.
You never call.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.807
I can't go to a restaurant
and pretend to be human

00:15.840 --> 00:18.207
when I wanna eat
the table next to me.

00:18.250 --> 00:20.446
- I will be strong
for both of us.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.619
- I lost my engagement ring.

00:22.650 --> 00:27.383
- Why'd you take it off?
- You know I love that ring! (Screaming)

00:27.420 --> 00:29.457
(Crying):
Danny killed me.

00:29.490 --> 00:31.959
(Glass shattering)

00:38.700 --> 00:41.067
(Car horns in distance)

00:41.100 --> 00:44.900
- (Aidan): What sets a human
apart from a monster,

00:44.940 --> 00:46.339
aside from genetics?

00:46.380 --> 00:48.405
Aside from the terrible truth?

00:48.440 --> 00:52.047
We walk the same streets.
We wear the same clothes.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.775
You take a breath,

00:53.820 --> 00:57.586
and there we are,
gulping the same air.

00:57.620 --> 01:00.885
We're walking
in your footsteps.

01:03.730 --> 01:08.258
** Gtill 1 lie silent... *

01:08.300 --> 01:14.899
And even a monster can posses that
most dominant of human emotions...

01:14.940 --> 01:16.704
fear.

01:16.740 --> 01:20.438
We know enough to remember
what we once were.

01:20.480 --> 01:25.509
We know enough to fear
what we can now do.

01:28.150 --> 01:34.089
And, like a human, we
obsess over love, over life,

01:34.120 --> 01:37.181
over every lost cause.

01:42.060 --> 01:45.064
* That kills *

01:45.100 --> 01:49.401
* Fire and soot *

01:49.440 --> 01:52.000
* From an iron flute *

01:52.040 --> 01:57.103
* That shakes the trees
from stem to root **

02:18.600 --> 02:20.762
The Vatican Tweets!

02:22.770 --> 02:25.205
I hate this decade.

02:25.240 --> 02:28.301
(Rattling)

02:30.580 --> 02:31.809
Is that you?

02:32.850 --> 02:33.920
- Sorry.

02:33.950 --> 02:35.975
- How are you doing
that, anyway?

02:36.020 --> 02:37.647
You can't...

02:37.690 --> 02:40.409
- Touch anything, do anything
but make the house shake.

02:40.460 --> 02:41.985
I know.

02:45.990 --> 02:48.152
Maybe because it's mine.

02:49.230 --> 02:51.870
Maybe because it's supposed
to be on my finger.

02:51.900 --> 02:54.995
- But I thought
that Danny took it.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.235
- He did.

02:57.270 --> 02:58.863
- Then how did it get here?

02:58.910 --> 03:04.201
- Aidan, I'm pretty much not gonna
have the answer to any of these questions.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.073
You look nice.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.384
- Is that...
You wearing perfume?

03:16.730 --> 03:19.756
So, it's like
a charged object, right?

03:19.800 --> 03:21.199
- Right.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.120
So I should do
something with it.

03:25.170 --> 03:27.298
- Wait a second. Hold on.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.729
When you say "do something,”

03:29.770 --> 03:32.603
you don't mean
with Danny, right?

03:32.640 --> 03:34.005
- Am I supposed to be over

03:34.040 --> 03:36.077
the whole wrongful-death
thing by now?

03:36.110 --> 03:38.442
You were the one who said
you'd take care of him.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.448
- Because I didn't wanna
see you get hurt,

03:40.480 --> 03:41.550
Hey, listen to me.

03:41.580 --> 03:43.218
The more involved you get,

03:43.250 --> 03:47.118
the more caught up
you get in revenge.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.480
(Footsteps approaching)

03:48.520 --> 03:50.784
You will be stuck, Sally.

03:50.830 --> 03:51.979
(Josh sighing)

03:52.030 --> 03:54.499
- Is it picture day
at school?

03:55.630 --> 03:56.597
What's up?

03:56.630 --> 03:58.359
- Nothing...

03:58.400 --> 03:59.731
...is up, OK?

03:59.770 --> 04:01.238
You just notice it more

04:01.270 --> 04:03.329
because you can't
change clothes.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.308
(Josh exhales)

04:06.340 --> 04:07.671
Mail call.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.348
Hello, sexy!

04:23.390 --> 04:25.757
Is that Rebecca?
- Um...

04:28.400 --> 04:29.561
- Who's Rebecca?

04:31.370 --> 04:33.065
- Are you two...

04:33.100 --> 04:34.534
- No.

04:35.700 --> 04:36.701
No!

04:37.570 --> 04:39.504
- Oh!

04:39.540 --> 04:41.599
OK, yeah, porn before
breakfast? Really?

04:41.640 --> 04:43.574
- We don't need to see this.
- Hey!

04:43.610 --> 04:45.669
- Stop! I mean, let it.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.310
- (Sally): Whoa!

04:51.350 --> 04:52.681
(Chuckles)

04:54.060 --> 04:55.357
That's a good dress.

04:56.830 --> 04:57.786
OK...

04:57.830 --> 04:58.820
- What is this?

04:58.860 --> 05:00.157
- Hi, boobs!

05:02.770 --> 05:04.590
Oh... What?

05:08.370 --> 05:13.001
Is she... She's a vampire?
- Oh my God! Oh, she's eating his face!

05:13.040 --> 05:14.439
- What is she doing?

05:14.480 --> 05:15.902
Oh my God!

05:15.940 --> 05:17.044
Oh!

05:17.080 --> 05:20.209
- Turn it off!
Turn it off! Whoa!

05:20.250 --> 05:22.116
- There's so much blood!

05:22.150 --> 05:24.812
- (Josh):
What the hell was that?

05:27.720 --> 05:29.927
- Ew, ew, ew! Is that...

05:31.290 --> 05:33.190
Is that what vampires do?

05:33.230 --> 05:35.619
- They get off on this,
don't they?

05:35.660 --> 05:36.968
- Some do.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.508
- So, is it something you like?

05:42.540 --> 05:44.201
- What?

05:44.240 --> 05:45.605
No!

05:45.640 --> 05:46.937
Josh...

05:46.980 --> 05:48.470
No! No.

05:48.510 --> 05:50.444
Someone's just trying
to mess with me.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.039
I will get rid of it.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.616
Don't worry.

05:54.850 --> 05:56.739
- I... I should, um...

05:56.790 --> 05:59.179
I should get to work.

06:02.090 --> 06:03.922
(Josh clears throat)

06:05.160 --> 06:07.151
(Exhales)

06:08.230 --> 06:12.599
** Bring your curtain *

06:12.640 --> 06:14.836
* Down **

06:16.270 --> 06:19.934
- We have the same
weaknesses as you.

06:19.980 --> 06:23.473
But even this
doesn't make us normal.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.671
But it does make us...

06:27.850 --> 06:30.012
unforgettable.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.596
- Hey.

06:47.640 --> 06:48.766
(Clears throat)

06:48.800 --> 06:50.768
- Hey. How's your...

06:50.810 --> 06:53.108
your day going so far?

06:53.140 --> 06:55.006
- Oh, not bad.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.179
Fender-bender, enema.

06:57.210 --> 06:58.746
Same old.

06:58.780 --> 07:00.578
- Well, I hope
the two weren't related.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.349
- So, they sent
Mr. Calambey home?

07:02.380 --> 07:05.680
His burns healed nicely.
- Yeah! Minor miracle.

07:05.720 --> 07:08.610
I'm not going anywhere near
my deep fryer anytime soon!

07:08.660 --> 07:10.185
- How can you even
own one of those?

07:10.230 --> 07:12.858
The fat alone is just--
- Oh no, I was...

07:12.900 --> 07:14.390
No, I was kidding.

07:14.430 --> 07:19.459
I was kidding. Although I'm not
past torching a brule on occasion.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.606
Because men enjoy...

07:22.640 --> 07:24.165
torching things.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.877
(Clears throat)

07:26.910 --> 07:28.605
- So, you like to cook?

07:28.640 --> 07:34.477
- Yeah, I always thought it would be
my other profession if I didn't go into...

07:34.520 --> 07:36.045
Um...

07:36.080 --> 07:40.153
So, I'm in this
rehabilitation program.

07:40.190 --> 07:41.214
- Oh!
- Yeah.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.955
Trying to prove
to Nora Sorgent,

07:42.990 --> 07:45.550
I'm an upstanding
member of society

07:45.590 --> 07:48.321
and not a raging ass hat.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.330
- Hmm. That must be
a New program.

07:51.370 --> 07:52.633
- Is.
- How's it going?

07:52.670 --> 07:54.764
- Decent. Yeah.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.906
Although I'm not really
putting in the effort that I'd like.

07:57.940 --> 07:59.874
- Oh, well,
one day at a time.

07:59.910 --> 08:01.002
(Laughing)

08:02.750 --> 08:05.845
- Yeah. Uh, so...

08:05.880 --> 08:09.111
I was wondering
if maybe you...

08:09.150 --> 08:15.749
if maybe you might want to eat
sometime. Uh, wow, like tomorrow.

08:15.790 --> 08:18.020
Because you're not
working the night shift,

08:18.060 --> 08:19.221
and, hey, neither am I.

08:19.260 --> 08:21.649
So what a serendipitous...

08:21.700 --> 08:23.759
bit of scheduling.

08:23.800 --> 08:26.292
- Well, I do need to eat.

08:28.670 --> 08:30.729
See you later,
dough eyes.

08:40.980 --> 08:42.072
- Well, that was fast.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.316
I told Rebecca
you'd be another day.

08:44.350 --> 08:46.887
I thought you'd wanna
watch it a few more times.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.581
- Can I talk to you alone?

08:50.060 --> 08:51.721
- I'm fine here.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.159
- Really?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.429
A porno?

08:54.460 --> 08:56.326
That's your big move?

08:56.360 --> 09:00.934
- Bishop likes to think of it
as a video postcard of sorts.

09:00.970 --> 09:02.563
"Wish you were here."

09:04.140 --> 09:05.767
- What are you doing?

09:05.810 --> 09:07.278
- What?

09:07.310 --> 09:09.745
You didn't like it?

09:09.780 --> 09:11.578
- Bishop knows
where I stand.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.977
A pathetic snuff film
isn't gonna change my mind.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.579
- Fair enough.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.582
Give it back,
and I'll dispose of it.

09:21.790 --> 09:23.121
Ah!

09:23.160 --> 09:25.219
You kept it!

09:26.260 --> 09:28.297
- So you do miss me.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.064
- Don't do that.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.999
You...

09:35.040 --> 09:37.668
You don't want me back.

09:37.710 --> 09:40.509
You ever thought of
what might happen?

09:40.540 --> 09:43.749
- Yes, it's all I think about. It's
all any of us think about, really.

09:43.780 --> 09:47.546
- You would be nothing...

09:47.580 --> 09:51.312
all over again,
and you know it.

09:51.350 --> 09:53.409
- Yap, yap, Yap.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.418
You and all the little doggies!

09:57.330 --> 09:59.890
(Barking)

10:01.160 --> 10:02.559
(Door closing)

10:02.600 --> 10:05.069
I thought you had
a hold over him.

10:05.100 --> 10:09.594
I guess I was wrong.
- It would have been fine if you weren't here.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.007
I can do it.
- That's what you keep saying!

10:12.040 --> 10:13.337
And yet...

10:13.380 --> 10:14.905
- Is it true what they say

10:14.940 --> 10:16.271
about Aidan and Bishop?

10:16.310 --> 10:19.439
- They weren't gods.

10:21.850 --> 10:23.716
Are you in love with him?

10:26.090 --> 10:27.910
- What would be the point?

10:38.470 --> 10:39.938
(Door closing)

10:39.970 --> 10:41.893
(Sirens in distance)

10:45.670 --> 10:47.308
(Footsteps approaching)

10:47.340 --> 10:48.774
- Ahh...

10:48.810 --> 10:50.300
(Exhaling)

10:52.610 --> 10:54.419
- Are you OK?

10:54.450 --> 10:56.441
- Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm...

10:58.090 --> 11:01.879
Maybe. Do you think if you
mention food to someone

11:01.920 --> 11:03.319
and they say
they like to eat,

11:03.360 --> 11:04.350
technically, it's a date?

11:04.390 --> 11:06.028
- No.
- No?

11:07.930 --> 11:11.127
Well, actually,
what she said was...

11:11.170 --> 11:13.366
"I guess I have to eat.”

11:15.100 --> 11:16.295
- Who?

11:16.340 --> 11:18.331
- Nora.

11:18.370 --> 11:19.508
Yeah.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.304
- She's speaking to you?
- Yes!

11:21.340 --> 11:24.105
And possibly
eating with me.

11:24.150 --> 11:25.948
- "I guess I have to eat..."
- No, yeah.

11:25.980 --> 11:27.869
It's not dripping
with enthusiasm.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.446
But it's not a no.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.515
- It's not a no. Mm-mmm.
- Not a no.

11:35.260 --> 11:36.284
What?

11:36.320 --> 11:37.355
- You're doing it.

11:37.390 --> 11:39.154
- Don't jinx it!

11:40.200 --> 11:41.554
(Exhales)

11:41.600 --> 11:44.763
It does make me wonder,
though, you know,

11:44.800 --> 11:47.633
what that would be like...

11:47.670 --> 11:50.002
be someone's boyfriend again.

11:50.770 --> 11:52.772
Share a paper, see a movie.

11:52.810 --> 11:54.130
- Sounds like retirement.

11:54.180 --> 11:57.480
Is sex in this equation?

11:59.050 --> 12:00.449
- What?

12:05.550 --> 12:06.915
Emily...

12:06.960 --> 12:10.828
- (Crying): I'm sorry. I just
didn't know where else to go.

12:25.210 --> 12:28.032
- So, what brings you here?

12:28.080 --> 12:31.448
- How about:
"Are you OK, Emily?"

12:31.480 --> 12:34.040
- Are you...
Are you OK, Emily?

12:34.080 --> 12:36.720
- I know you don't wanna see me.
OK? I get it.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.514
Jackie and I broke up.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.789
- Oh...

12:41.820 --> 12:43.356
That's rough.

12:43.390 --> 12:44.152
- Thank you.

12:44.190 --> 12:46.557
And I can't keep
living in there,

12:46.590 --> 12:50.026
and it's too late to
find a roommate this semester.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.629
- So...

12:51.670 --> 12:53.536
- I need a place to crash, OK?

12:53.570 --> 12:56.039
- Uh, OK, see, I--
- Aidan's OK with it.

12:56.070 --> 12:58.129
Right?

12:59.410 --> 13:01.879
- She's your sister.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.045
(Sighs)

13:05.080 --> 13:09.472
- How long?
- Just till I get back on my feet.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.383
Can I have this cookie?

13:17.190 --> 13:20.399
** T have seen the most *

13:20.430 --> 13:23.422
* Incredible light *

13:23.470 --> 13:27.134
* In your eyes
In your eyes... *

13:27.170 --> 13:29.138
(Door buzzing)

13:33.410 --> 13:39.042
* I have seen the most
incredible light *

13:39.080 --> 13:42.380
* In your eyes
In your eyes *

13:42.420 --> 13:44.684
* In your eyes *

13:44.720 --> 13:46.245
- Hello?

13:46.290 --> 13:48.179
- Hello.

13:48.220 --> 13:52.589
* So cast away *

13:52.630 --> 13:55.827
* All your pain... **

13:55.860 --> 13:57.760
Hey, did someone call...

14:00.070 --> 14:01.333
Aidan, hey.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.069
Did you call
about the sink?

14:05.110 --> 14:06.509
- Did we?

14:08.610 --> 14:10.647
Uh, yeah, my bad.
Come on in.

14:12.650 --> 14:14.641
(Grunting)

14:14.680 --> 14:16.739
- Ahh!

14:17.850 --> 14:20.251
(Choking)

14:20.290 --> 14:21.917
What the hell
are you doing?

14:21.960 --> 14:24.452
- You think you'd get away
with killing our girl?

14:28.130 --> 14:30.167
Any preference?

14:30.200 --> 14:32.191
- Just make it hurt.

14:34.170 --> 14:36.639
- Ahh! Ah!

14:38.540 --> 14:41.180
(Screaming)

14:43.880 --> 14:45.348
(Danny screaming)

14:45.380 --> 14:47.269
(Rattling)

14:58.530 --> 15:00.749
- I know.
She disgusts me.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.996
The thought of her...
Like, ugh!

15:03.030 --> 15:04.520
She makes me wanna lick a guy
from head to toe.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.969
- ...get the blood
out of the fridge.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.035
- And then the porn?

15:07.070 --> 15:08.367
We'll lose
the snuff film, right?

15:08.400 --> 15:10.505
- I told you I took care of it!
- OK!

15:10.540 --> 15:12.634
Hey, listen, a couple
of days, right?

15:12.670 --> 15:14.172
- Huh?
- We were human once.

15:14.210 --> 15:16.633
We can do this!
All right. Come on.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.818
(Rattling)

15:21.850 --> 15:26.720
What the hell is this?
- What's it look like? I'm freaking out.

15:26.750 --> 15:29.310
- No, no, no freaking out!
Not now!

15:29.360 --> 15:31.226
<i>- Emily's here,
Everyone just be normal.</i>

15:31.260 --> 15:33.194
- How am I supposed
to be normal?

15:33.230 --> 15:34.891
I need to talk to you.

15:34.930 --> 15:37.024
(Exhales)

15:38.700 --> 15:40.236
- And here we are.

15:40.270 --> 15:42.432
- Why are we shaking?

15:43.440 --> 15:44.908
- That's your sister?

15:44.940 --> 15:47.329
She's so cute!

15:48.680 --> 15:51.980
<i>- That's the 1.
The train. The T train.</i>

15:52.010 --> 15:53.819
- Well, that blows.

15:53.850 --> 15:55.375
- You could crash
somewhere else.

15:55.420 --> 15:58.583
- Hey! That's your sister.
Tell her she's welcome.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.384
- Make yourself at home.

16:00.420 --> 16:03.981
- I can't even see through
the haze of warm and fuzzy!

16:05.360 --> 16:07.556
Please tell me
you have booze in there.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.489
- Help yourself.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.037
Stop shaking
the house right now.

16:15.070 --> 16:17.801
- Yeah, can't.
It' called a crisis.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.103
(Shattering)

16:19.140 --> 16:21.939
- Not my fault! I Swear!
- No worries!

16:21.980 --> 16:23.243
Try!

16:23.280 --> 16:26.875
- OK, when you whisper to me,
it makes me feel like a ghost.

16:26.910 --> 16:28.571
And that makes it worse.

16:30.650 --> 16:32.243
- Stop shaking!

16:32.290 --> 16:34.156
- Hey, Josh...

16:34.190 --> 16:37.751
Why are there, like,
5 rump roasts in your freezer?

16:37.790 --> 16:39.827
- (Laughing): Are there?

16:39.860 --> 16:42.500
- OK, so, dinner, right?

16:42.530 --> 16:44.464
What do people like to eat?

16:44.500 --> 16:46.127
What do we, the people,

16:46.170 --> 16:48.138
like to eat?

16:53.180 --> 16:54.670
- Aidan's hot.

16:54.710 --> 16:56.109
(Laughing)

16:56.140 --> 16:58.450
Sometimes I wish
I was into that.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.619
Jackie would so freak!

17:00.650 --> 17:02.618
- Yeah, you don't wanna...

17:02.650 --> 17:05.950
That is complicated.

17:05.990 --> 17:09.153
- Um, yeah,
part of the appeal!

17:10.829 --> 17:13.390
How's things going
on your front?

17:14.430 --> 17:16.296
- Oh, good.

17:16.329 --> 17:17.798
Work's good.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.834
- Girls, Josh. Life.

17:20.869 --> 17:23.430
Are you OK?

17:25.210 --> 17:28.840
Because last time,
you weren't.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.715
- Yeah.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.646
Look, I...

17:40.490 --> 17:42.879
I know I said some things...

17:45.230 --> 17:47.551
I apologize.

17:49.730 --> 17:51.289
- Forget about it.

17:51.330 --> 17:53.025
You owe me one.

17:54.970 --> 17:56.938
Hey, uh...

17:56.970 --> 17:59.109
I told mom and dad
I saw you.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.278
- Whoops.

18:01.310 --> 18:04.575
But, see, there you go.
All even!

18:05.710 --> 18:07.576
- Em...
- You're their son!

18:07.620 --> 18:09.213
They're worried about you.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.639
They didn't even know
you were alive.

18:15.090 --> 18:16.888
- What did you tell them?

18:16.920 --> 18:18.354
- What do you think?

18:18.390 --> 18:19.721
Everything.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.063
(Exhaling)

18:30.210 --> 18:32.565
- Well...
(Clears throat)

18:33.580 --> 18:34.979
...since you asked,

18:35.010 --> 18:38.469
I did ask someone out.

18:38.510 --> 18:43.414
And it's vaguely possible that she said yes.
- You dog, you!

18:43.450 --> 18:44.713
- It's not like we...

18:44.750 --> 18:46.787
I mean, we haven't,
you know, yet.

18:46.820 --> 18:49.517
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
So don't care!

18:49.560 --> 18:50.686
(Laughing)

18:50.730 --> 18:52.789
Another beer?

18:52.830 --> 18:56.391
(Door opening, closing)

19:02.970 --> 19:04.165
(Door opens)

19:04.210 --> 19:05.507
- You coming?

19:08.010 --> 19:09.899
The food's getting cold.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.339
- What?

19:11.380 --> 19:14.077
Yeah, right. Right.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.165
<i>- I know.</i>

19:36.200 --> 19:38.305
It sucks.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.908
(Sighs)

19:40.940 --> 19:42.999
I could make you feel
so much better

19:43.040 --> 19:45.350
if you could
actually hear me.

19:45.380 --> 19:48.020
My fiance killed me.

19:48.050 --> 19:52.214
I guess you're happy things didn't
get that bad with what's-her-name.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.726
I bet you wanna
get back at her.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.023
Right?

20:01.060 --> 20:02.949
Make her feel bad?

20:04.970 --> 20:07.189
Because what is she
really doing?

20:08.600 --> 20:11.103
She's just gallivanting
around, right?

20:11.140 --> 20:14.576
Totally fine with the fact
that she decimated you.

20:18.310 --> 20:21.610
Don't you feel like
we should do something?

20:21.650 --> 20:24.745
- Good morning!
Oh, apples!

20:24.790 --> 20:26.485
- This place is freezing.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.557
I'm getting a sweater.

20:35.660 --> 20:39.164
(Sighing)
- What?

20:41.570 --> 20:42.992
- I know you're frustrated.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.337
- Frustrated?

20:44.370 --> 20:46.805
Ha!
I'm dead.

20:47.740 --> 20:49.970
- I think maybe that ring...

20:50.010 --> 20:53.105
is maybe what's
making you so jittery.

20:53.150 --> 20:56.939
You should get rid of it.
- I can't.

20:56.980 --> 20:59.312
It's attached to me.

21:01.420 --> 21:04.355
It's basically
a murder weapon, you know?

21:05.590 --> 21:07.228
It's the reason I died.

21:08.530 --> 21:10.498
- So you've tried
to get rid of it?

21:10.530 --> 21:13.739
- Let's go back to when you
wanted to rip his head off.

21:13.770 --> 21:15.590
I like that Aidan!

21:15.640 --> 21:18.905
Yes, I've tried to
get rid of it!

21:20.940 --> 21:22.635
Whatever I do...

21:23.750 --> 21:25.377
it comes back to me.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.946
Like when it fell
down the drain.

21:26.980 --> 21:29.813
The house wouldn't rest
till it came back to me.

21:29.850 --> 21:30.681
- I've been thinking
about it.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.711
It wasn't the house.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.081
It was you,

21:34.120 --> 21:35.884
(Exhales)

21:39.330 --> 21:41.025
- I need to do something.

21:41.060 --> 21:42.721
- Like what?

21:42.760 --> 21:46.025
- Like push Danny down
every staircase in Boston.

21:46.070 --> 21:49.597
Like make him see my face
in every shadowy hallway.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.507
Like... Like make him
choke on this damn ring

21:52.540 --> 21:54.736
every time he takes
a bite of food.

21:55.780 --> 21:58.841
You think I wanna be
shaking this house?

21:58.880 --> 22:03.545
I wanna shake
his very existence!

22:03.590 --> 22:06.218
But this...

22:07.090 --> 22:09.559
This is all I have.

22:09.590 --> 22:11.820
(Rattling)

22:33.350 --> 22:35.512
- You know what?
Let me...

22:35.550 --> 22:37.348
Let me get her coffee.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.484
- You don't have to do that.
- No, really.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.110
(Clearing throat)

22:42.160 --> 22:43.855
Thank you.

22:47.230 --> 22:48.720
So...

22:48.760 --> 22:50.797
- So...

22:50.830 --> 22:53.094
- So, I hope this
doesn't count as our date,

22:53.130 --> 22:56.862
because I was really hoping to
do better than cafeteria coffee.

22:56.900 --> 23:01.201
- You'd have to spring for
a croissant to get in my pants.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.743
- Oh...
- I'm-I'm kidding.

23:03.780 --> 23:06.545
- Right. Right. Me too.

23:06.580 --> 23:08.469
So, we are having a date?

23:08.520 --> 23:10.818
- I thought so.

23:10.850 --> 23:12.887
Is this a thing
that you do?

23:12.920 --> 23:15.309
You turn it around so
the girl ends up asking you out?

23:15.360 --> 23:18.159
Slick!
- No, I just wasn't...

23:19.460 --> 23:24.626
OK. So, dinner at my place.
Here...

23:24.670 --> 23:27.162
(Chuckling)

23:28.200 --> 23:30.032
...IS my address.

23:30.070 --> 23:32.562
So, now you have it.

23:32.610 --> 23:35.204
- I will treasure
this cup always.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.504
- See, you want me to think
that you're joking,

23:37.550 --> 23:39.279
but I really have
no way of knowing.

23:39.310 --> 23:42.177
Maybe you have a treasure trove
of stalker paraphernalia.

23:42.220 --> 23:44.086
- Yes, because I'm
the strange one here.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.043
- Exactly!
- Yeah.

23:46.090 --> 23:47.046
(Laughing)

23:47.090 --> 23:50.060
- Um... OK,
so I'll see you tonight.

23:50.090 --> 23:51.524
(Giggling)

23:51.560 --> 23:53.619
- OK.
- Al right.

24:00.070 --> 24:01.060
- Hello?

24:04.070 --> 24:05.708
Danny?

24:08.280 --> 24:09.907
Oh God!

24:11.210 --> 24:13.247
Why didn't you say anything?

24:13.280 --> 24:15.419
- Are you messing
with me, Bridg?

24:15.450 --> 24:18.249
- What are you talking about?
I just got here.

24:20.290 --> 24:22.486
- Then what the hell is this?

24:29.730 --> 24:31.289
- Unh...

24:31.330 --> 24:33.128
- Are you messing with me?

24:33.170 --> 24:34.331
- Stop!

24:36.440 --> 24:38.761
Danny, you're hurting me!

24:40.440 --> 24:42.602
(Sirens in distance)

25:14.610 --> 25:17.978
- You still watching that?
- Oh, don't do that!

25:18.010 --> 25:19.569
- I could come back.

25:19.610 --> 25:21.612
- Pshh.

25:21.650 --> 25:22.947
- Sorry.

25:23.990 --> 25:24.946
It's just...

25:24.990 --> 25:27.311
Emily's drinking
alone downstairs

25:27.350 --> 25:31.150
and it's all starting to
feel creepy and lonely.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.432
(Aidan exhales)

25:42.800 --> 25:44.404
- What's going on?

25:45.810 --> 25:48.438
- I messed with Danny...

25:48.480 --> 25:50.209
with the ring.

25:50.240 --> 25:55.474
And it felt really
briefly satisfying.

25:55.520 --> 25:56.919
Is that awful?

25:57.950 --> 25:59.645
(Exhales)

26:00.520 --> 26:03.182
- I don't wanna
see you do anything

26:03.220 --> 26:06.155
that will mess with
your karma, you know?

26:06.190 --> 26:07.282
- Oh.

26:07.330 --> 26:09.196
- Hey, look,
I lived through the '60s,

26:09.230 --> 26:13.292
a few of them. I can talk
about karma without irony.

26:13.330 --> 26:15.139
- Are you in love with Elvira?

26:17.300 --> 26:18.904
- Rebecca? Um...

26:22.540 --> 26:24.770
I feel responsible for her.,

26:26.210 --> 26:30.317
- Why? She looks like
she can take care of herself.

26:34.320 --> 26:35.958
- Maybe.

26:37.660 --> 26:40.698
** Make peace with the dead *

26:40.730 --> 26:42.425
* Make peace
with the dead... *

26:42.460 --> 26:43.962
- Oh, yum!

26:44.000 --> 26:45.195
- Relax.

26:45.230 --> 26:46.925
(Coughing)

26:46.970 --> 26:48.961
I got another
bottle of vodka.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.035
- What?

26:50.070 --> 26:51.959
I don't even drink vodka.

26:52.010 --> 26:54.707
- Oh, so that was all me.

26:54.740 --> 26:57.949
- You know what?
You should go out.

26:57.980 --> 27:00.347
Just, you know,
be young, wild.

27:00.380 --> 27:02.075
As soon as possible.

27:03.320 --> 27:06.915
I have a date.
- Oh yeah!

27:06.950 --> 27:10.159
That girl whose pants
you're too scared to unbutton?

27:12.290 --> 27:13.257
- Yes.

27:13.290 --> 27:14.894
Thank you.

27:15.630 --> 27:17.052
(Emily laughing)

27:18.800 --> 27:20.461
- What do you say?

27:20.500 --> 27:22.832
- Mind if I brown bag it?

27:22.870 --> 27:25.407
- You can do
whatever you want.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.831
- She cannot do
whatever she wants.

27:28.880 --> 27:29.904
P.S.

27:29.940 --> 27:32.147
- Relax, narc.

27:32.180 --> 27:34.569
- Yeah, no, great,
you go ahead.

27:34.620 --> 27:37.248
I'll stay here,
do nothing, again.

27:37.280 --> 27:41.456
- You know what? Why don't you
all go out and just have a great time?

27:41.490 --> 27:42.980
(Door buzzing)

27:43.020 --> 27:44.579
- I'll get it!
- I'll get it!

27:44.630 --> 27:46.450
- No! You stop now!

27:46.490 --> 27:48.094
No, no, no!

27:48.130 --> 27:49.620
(Emily giggling)

27:52.530 --> 27:54.692
- Oh, hello.
- Hi!

27:54.740 --> 27:57.630
- Nora, Emily.
That's my leaving sister.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.969
Come in.
Come on in.

28:02.440 --> 28:05.444
- Josh, she is so hot!
Look at her boobs!

28:05.480 --> 28:07.710
I've always wanted
boobs like that.

28:07.750 --> 28:10.515
- Come in! Come in!

28:10.550 --> 28:12.348
How about a vodka shot?

28:12.390 --> 28:13.880
- Emily, she doesn't want
a vodka shot, OK?

28:13.920 --> 28:14.990
She's an adult.

28:15.020 --> 28:16.852
- One shot.
- Ooh!

28:16.890 --> 28:18.449
(Laughs)

28:21.100 --> 28:23.990
* You have to follow again *

28:24.030 --> 28:26.465
- You're gonna have
the best night!

28:28.440 --> 28:30.568
* We feel gone
We feel gone **

28:33.980 --> 28:36.733
(* Dance *)

28:36.780 --> 28:38.270
- This doesn't suck.

28:38.310 --> 28:39.744
- You want a drink?

28:39.780 --> 28:43.819
- I've been drinking
since breakfast.

28:43.850 --> 28:45.113
All right, I'm going in.

28:45.150 --> 28:47.289
Hmm, feels like a redhead
kind of night.

28:47.320 --> 28:48.310
- Hey!

28:49.860 --> 28:51.555
Just have fun.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.819
- Your description
of this place?

28:55.860 --> 28:56.998
Not accurate.

28:57.030 --> 28:59.670
I ended up in
what might have been

28:59.700 --> 29:01.691
the basement of
a serial killer.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.936
You should probably
look into that.

29:03.970 --> 29:06.029
I'm never going out again.

29:07.140 --> 29:08.369
Human boys.

29:12.110 --> 29:15.045
- He doesn't know
what he's missing!

29:15.080 --> 29:17.412
- Seriously. Freaking eunuch.

29:17.450 --> 29:18.849
Oh!

29:18.890 --> 29:21.018
Let's go pour a drink
down his pants.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.381
His junk will shrink
like a toe in a tub.

29:23.420 --> 29:24.956
Hmm?

29:27.930 --> 29:29.989
- Josh, this is
shockingly good!

29:30.030 --> 29:32.124
- (Laughing):
Thank you.

29:32.170 --> 29:35.094
But the torch
really did the...

29:35.140 --> 29:36.392
heavy lifting.

29:36.440 --> 29:37.692
(Laughs)

29:37.740 --> 29:39.060
- Who has a kitchen torch

29:39.110 --> 29:41.738
besides Martha Stewart
and her newlywed minions?

29:41.780 --> 29:43.532
That's something
you register for

29:43.580 --> 29:45.207
and never take out
of the box.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.173
- Yeah, that's what
my fiance said.

29:47.210 --> 29:49.474
- What, you were engaged?

29:49.520 --> 29:51.079
Were you married?

29:51.120 --> 29:53.680
- Oh no, no. And...

29:53.720 --> 29:56.109
- What happened?

29:58.960 --> 30:01.725
- It's a long story.

30:02.730 --> 30:05.768
Um... it just
didn't end well.

30:05.800 --> 30:08.440
- Too young?

30:08.470 --> 30:10.131
- Yeah. Um...

30:10.170 --> 30:12.639
I changed.

30:13.910 --> 30:16.834
- You answer questions
like an escaped convict.

30:16.880 --> 30:19.906
- What? Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

30:19.950 --> 30:21.475
- Mysterious.
- Yeah...

30:21.520 --> 30:22.976
- Not too much detail.

30:23.020 --> 30:27.048
- Well, the details
would bore you.

30:27.090 --> 30:28.910
I'm a Jewish kid
from Ithaca.

30:28.960 --> 30:32.089
- As in Ithaca is gorgeous?
- Yes., (Laughing)

30:32.130 --> 30:34.451
- Cute, dough eyes!

30:34.500 --> 30:36.150
What about college?

30:38.030 --> 30:40.226
- MIT.

30:40.270 --> 30:42.659
- Shut up!
- Yeah, anyone can get in.

30:42.700 --> 30:44.509
- Screw you!

30:44.540 --> 30:47.931
What are you doing
folding hospital corners?

30:49.940 --> 30:51.669
- Life experience.

30:52.580 --> 30:54.878
More wine? I should get
more wine maybe.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.319
This is gone.

30:56.350 --> 30:58.546
(Josh clears throat)

31:01.420 --> 31:03.115
(* Dance *)

31:03.160 --> 31:05.583
- Lindsey. Aneurism. 1991.

31:05.630 --> 31:10.329
- Oh... At your age?
- I know, right? Wicked tragic!

31:10.360 --> 31:12.419
So, how'd you bite it?

31:12.470 --> 31:14.495
- My fiance killed me.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.292
- Shut up!
- Can't.

31:16.340 --> 31:19.970
- Oh! Wow!
How mad are you?

31:21.380 --> 31:24.042
- I desperately wanna
wreak havoc on Danny,

31:24.080 --> 31:26.902
but my friend Aidan
thinks it's a bad idea,

31:26.950 --> 31:29.009
like I'll be stuck
here or something.

31:29.050 --> 31:30.279
- That's a bunch of bull!

31:30.320 --> 31:31.845
You're just supposed to
let Danny get away with it?

31:31.890 --> 31:34.018
- Yes, that's what I think.
But he's...

31:34.060 --> 31:36.051
- No, we'll figure it out.
Screw Aidan!

31:36.090 --> 31:38.457
No one gets what
we're going through but us!

31:38.490 --> 31:42.449
Oh, honey, you're so
happy you've met me!

31:47.200 --> 31:49.532
(Beating)

31:53.210 --> 31:55.304
- Holy mother.

31:55.340 --> 31:58.776
That looks like a girl
that forgot her underwear.

32:02.580 --> 32:05.140
- What are you doing here?

32:05.190 --> 32:07.340
- Painting the town red.

32:10.420 --> 32:11.626
Wanna come?

32:11.660 --> 32:15.858
- OK, so, I'm gonna go to
a place that is not here.

32:19.330 --> 32:20.991
- I like your
new girlfriend.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.292
- That's Josh's sister.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.138
- Are you running
a kennel now?

32:24.170 --> 32:25.899
She didn't smell
like a bitch.

32:25.940 --> 32:28.170
- I don't have
anything to say to you.

32:28.210 --> 32:31.646
- You wouldn't have shown up
the other day looking for me

32:31.680 --> 32:33.170
if you had
nothing to say.

32:33.210 --> 32:35.269
- You are a lost cause.

32:35.320 --> 32:36.810
- Wow!

32:36.850 --> 32:38.181
We have eternity,

32:38.220 --> 32:41.190
and you're really
gonna give up now?

32:44.030 --> 32:48.354
They sent you that DVD
because they think I affect you.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.357
- Brilliant!

32:50.400 --> 32:52.994
- Pretend I don't. Whatever.

32:53.030 --> 32:56.534
I spend half my time trying
to forget about you, too.

32:56.570 --> 32:58.664
I give up.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.550
- I like these plates.

33:04.580 --> 33:05.945
They've got character.

33:05.980 --> 33:09.541
- Thanks. Yeah, we found
'em at a flea market.

33:09.580 --> 33:11.981
Aidan had a few
from an old set, so...

33:12.020 --> 33:14.614
- Is that how you two
ended up living together?

33:14.660 --> 33:17.015
Your love of
vintage china?

33:18.530 --> 33:20.680
- Um... actually, no.

33:20.730 --> 33:22.323
We, uh...

33:22.360 --> 33:24.692
We met in a fight.

33:24.730 --> 33:29.998
Well, sort of a fight.
It was... I was being fought.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.769
Pummelled, really.

33:33.870 --> 33:36.635
- So, you're an antiquer,
not a fighter.

33:36.680 --> 33:38.102
Much hotter.

33:40.110 --> 33:41.475
- Seriously?

33:41.520 --> 33:43.147
- No.

33:43.180 --> 33:45.148
But that's OK.

33:53.590 --> 33:56.127
** What is the way... *

33:56.160 --> 33:59.061
- You're scared.
I saw it.

33:59.100 --> 34:03.640
- Before or after I ripped
that joker's neck off, I loved it.

34:05.970 --> 34:07.131
Even if I didn't,

34:07.170 --> 34:10.538
I'm supposed to disobey,
go against King Bishop?

34:11.679 --> 34:14.069
You killed me,
but he made me.

34:18.350 --> 34:19.487
- At the hotel,

34:19.520 --> 34:22.159
I looked up
and you were gone.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.851
- I thought I was
doing you a favour.

34:25.889 --> 34:27.722
- By going back to Bishop?
To Marcus?

34:27.760 --> 34:29.228
You're probably just
doing their bidding

34:29.260 --> 34:32.321
by talking to me now!
- I was. Marcus brought me here tonight.

34:32.370 --> 34:34.589
- Oh God, Rebecca!
- Why do you think I'm telling you?

34:34.639 --> 34:36.699
I'm coming clean.
I can't do this.

34:36.739 --> 34:41.371
What do you want from me?
I'm screwed, Aidan!

34:41.409 --> 34:43.299
Anything I do!

34:43.340 --> 34:45.308
You know that!

34:50.320 --> 34:53.779
- I shouldn't have let you
walk inside that night.

34:55.690 --> 35:00.230
I should have just walked
away and let you live your life.

35:01.730 --> 35:04.165
- I wasn't living it that well.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.294
* Opposite, opposite *

35:06.330 --> 35:09.038
* Opposite, opposite *

35:19.210 --> 35:22.248
* Opposite, opposite *

35:24.120 --> 35:26.088
(Sirens in distance)

35:30.720 --> 35:32.654
(Door opening)

35:32.690 --> 35:35.159
* Opposite *

35:35.200 --> 35:38.022
* Opposite, opposite **

35:46.070 --> 35:47.936
- Can I help you with that?

35:47.970 --> 35:50.007
- I'm a skirt chaser, babe.

35:51.080 --> 35:53.845
But I'll take a light
if you got it.

36:04.390 --> 36:06.620
(* Dance *)

36:06.660 --> 36:08.924
- So, do you
come here a lot?

36:08.960 --> 36:11.600
- I go wherever he goes.

36:11.630 --> 36:12.700
- Who's that?

36:12.730 --> 36:14.664
- The douche
who went on without me.

36:14.700 --> 36:16.794
You can call him Bill.

36:16.840 --> 36:17.898
- Huh.

36:17.940 --> 36:19.908
- Coming to these places
night after night,

36:19.940 --> 36:22.034
trolling for
some girl dumb enough

36:22.080 --> 36:24.401
to lick his rotted
herpes face for a night.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.179
It makes me sick.

36:26.210 --> 36:28.679
Let's go say hi! Hmm?

36:35.620 --> 36:37.657
- Please don't.

36:37.690 --> 36:38.919
- So, what are
you gonna do?

36:38.960 --> 36:41.088
- I don't know,
What do you feel like?

36:41.130 --> 36:43.952
Make him think he's seeing
maggots in his whisky?

36:44.000 --> 36:46.719
Make his teeth fall out
while he talks up a slut?

36:46.770 --> 36:48.067
(Lindsey giggling)

36:48.100 --> 36:51.331
- You can do that?
- I can make him think it's happening.

36:51.370 --> 36:54.135
See, that's why
you look so sad, honey.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.400
You're wasting your time
trying to be a ghost.

36:56.440 --> 36:57.635
It's boring!

36:57.680 --> 37:00.843
- I know.
- But a poltergeist...

37:00.880 --> 37:02.439
Delicious!

37:05.020 --> 37:07.409
- What are you saying?

37:08.660 --> 37:11.015
- Get 'em off!
Get 'em off me!

37:11.060 --> 37:13.028
Get out of the way! Move!

37:13.060 --> 37:14.619
Get it off me!

37:14.660 --> 37:15.752
(Laughing)

37:15.800 --> 37:17.655
- Danny can't even hear me!

37:17.700 --> 37:19.190
How do you do that?

37:19.230 --> 37:22.063
- Honestly, for the first
5 years, I couldn't do squat.

37:22.100 --> 37:24.865
But for the past 15, hello!

37:24.910 --> 37:27.538
I know, I should probably
just kill him, right?

37:27.570 --> 37:28.537
Buzz kill!

37:28.580 --> 37:30.878
- Fatal-attraction ghost. Wow!

37:32.280 --> 37:33.748
(Laughing)

37:33.780 --> 37:35.771
So, what about your door?

37:35.820 --> 37:37.413
- My what?

37:37.450 --> 37:40.010
- Your door.
You know, how you move on.

37:40.050 --> 37:41.586
- Move on to what?

37:42.690 --> 37:45.523
I'm sorry, babe,
I gotta go.

37:45.560 --> 37:49.554
Bill hasn't gotten his rocks off in 5
years. You know why? Vigilance!

37:49.600 --> 37:52.023
Well, come find me
sometime, yeah?

37:52.070 --> 37:53.299
We'll get your guy.

37:53.330 --> 37:54.331
(Kissing)

37:54.370 --> 37:55.667
(Giggles)

38:04.780 --> 38:06.407
(Breathing heavily)

38:11.490 --> 38:13.049
- Well, now!

38:13.090 --> 38:14.558
- Sorry, did I...

38:14.590 --> 38:17.355
- Relax. I've got a good
right hook if I need it.

38:17.390 --> 38:19.279
- OK. Just...

38:19.330 --> 38:20.582
Am I being too...

38:20.630 --> 38:23.224
- You're being too polite.
- Yeah, I just...

38:26.470 --> 38:28.290
I just wanna make sure.

38:28.340 --> 38:29.466
Yeah...

38:29.500 --> 38:31.559
- What happened to you?

38:32.410 --> 38:34.208
(Door buzzing)

38:34.240 --> 38:37.232
(Both breathing heavily)

38:38.910 --> 38:41.140
- Just...
- Yeah, OK.

38:44.320 --> 38:45.913
(Exhales)

38:46.950 --> 38:48.486
- Ah jeez!

38:48.520 --> 38:49.487
- Sorry, sorry.

38:49.520 --> 38:51.579
You were heavy petting,
so I hid here.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.359
- Who are you talking to?

38:54.230 --> 38:57.052
- Who the hell
is here this late?

39:04.340 --> 39:05.762
Yes?

39:05.810 --> 39:07.039
- Bridget?

39:07.070 --> 39:08.435
- Bridget.

39:09.310 --> 39:10.903
- Have we met?

39:10.940 --> 39:14.240
- No, sorry.
I'm Josh.

39:14.280 --> 39:17.409
- Oh, right,
the boyfriend.

39:17.450 --> 39:18.781
- What?

39:18.820 --> 39:22.609
- Um... I think
this belongs here.

39:32.030 --> 39:35.364
- Isn't this Danny's?
- It's not Danny's. It's mine.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.061
(Rattling)

39:38.510 --> 39:40.308
(Clears throat)

39:40.340 --> 39:42.934
- Just put it somewhere, OK?

39:42.980 --> 39:45.244
I'm pretty sure
it belongs here.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.248
- OK.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.077
- Bridg...

39:51.120 --> 39:53.145
- Good night.

40:03.060 --> 40:04.869
- Uh...

40:13.310 --> 40:17.508
- Where to?
- Uh... I gotta go.

40:17.540 --> 40:18.871
- What?

40:18.910 --> 40:23.541
- I gotta... I left Emily and it's
late. I should take her home.

40:23.580 --> 40:25.514
- You're kidding me, right?

40:28.990 --> 40:30.412
- I...

40:30.460 --> 40:32.952
I really... No. No. No.

40:32.990 --> 40:34.060
I gotta go.

40:34.090 --> 40:38.049
- So, let the dog catcher
take her home.

40:38.100 --> 40:39.795
Come on.

40:40.970 --> 40:43.894
Ugh, I'm not doing
this for Bishop.

40:43.940 --> 40:45.430
I told you,
to hell with them.

40:45.470 --> 40:46.904
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

40:46.940 --> 40:48.430
- Yes. Yes, it does.

40:48.480 --> 40:49.800
It really does.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.376
But I...

40:53.350 --> 40:55.546
I can't get into it tonight.

40:56.920 --> 40:59.014
- Ugh... Ugh!

40:59.050 --> 41:01.246
Maybe they have a point!

41:01.290 --> 41:03.281
Marcus and the rest.

41:03.320 --> 41:05.357
At least they
stick together.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.269
- I'm sorry.

41:29.650 --> 41:31.709
- You know, you, um...

41:31.750 --> 41:34.583
You really
don't have to go.

41:34.620 --> 41:36.213
- It's late.

41:36.260 --> 41:39.082
I should.
(Sighs)

41:50.170 --> 41:51.467
(Door opening)

41:51.500 --> 41:54.777
Did you arrange this or something?
- I swear...

41:54.810 --> 41:56.232
- Oh my God!

41:56.280 --> 41:57.839
- Josh...

42:01.110 --> 42:02.748
- Em!

42:02.780 --> 42:03.747
Oh no!

42:03.780 --> 42:05.817
What happened?
What happened?

42:05.850 --> 42:09.889
- I'm sorry, Josh. I know
you guys wanted to be alone.

42:09.920 --> 42:12.958
- I'm sorry. I-- - No, we're
taking her to the hospital.

42:12.990 --> 42:14.287
- I don't need to. I...

42:14.330 --> 42:17.493
I don't want you guys to--
- Hey, hey.

42:17.530 --> 42:19.123
We're going, OK?

42:19.170 --> 42:20.319
We're going.

42:20.370 --> 42:22.566
Can you stand?
Can you walk?

42:22.600 --> 42:26.901
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, come on. Come on. (Coughing)

42:51.600 --> 42:53.694
(Inhaling)

42:58.300 --> 43:01.600
** The stars wait
for a lot of days... *

43:01.640 --> 43:03.005
- Where are they?

43:03.040 --> 43:05.099
- The hospital.

43:05.150 --> 43:06.743
Aidan!

43:06.780 --> 43:08.839
* I'm tired of
the constellations *

43:08.880 --> 43:10.871
* Fights for euthanasia *

43:10.920 --> 43:14.311
* Did we ever really
land on the moon? *

43:19.490 --> 43:22.926
* Maybe there's a weight
on the words "I miss you" *

43:22.960 --> 43:24.394
* Do they impress you? *

43:24.430 --> 43:26.762
* That's the way love moves *

43:29.000 --> 43:31.389
* I'm tired of
the constellations *

43:31.440 --> 43:33.534
* And stars being
every solution *

43:33.570 --> 43:36.005
* For the weight I fee| **
