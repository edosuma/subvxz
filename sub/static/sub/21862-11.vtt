<c.speaker>Princess Elena.

01:13.250 --> 01:14.375
<c.speaker>Quita Moz?

01:14.375 --> 01:15.958
<c.speaker>You can still defeat
the sorceress

01:15.958 --> 01:19.083
<c.speaker>if you learn all the powers
of your scepter.

01:21.166 --> 01:23.083
<c.speaker>[calling]

01:33.000 --> 01:35.458
<c.speakerTop>And where are you
rushing off to?

01:35.458 --> 01:38.458
<c.speakerTop>Vallestrella. I'm going
to visit the sunbird oracle.

01:38.458 --> 01:40.958
<c.speakerTop>Quita Moz is going to teach me
how to master my scepter.

01:40.958 --> 01:44.458
<c.speakerTop>So it's true?
You're leaving again?

01:44.458 --> 01:46.125
<c.speakerTop>But you just got back.

01:46.125 --> 01:48.250
<c.speaker>Okay, time for me to go.

01:50.291 --> 01:51.500
<c.speaker>Hey, Isabel.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.083
<c.speaker>Come sit with me.

01:55.125 --> 01:57.250
<c.speaker>Do you really have to go?

01:57.250 --> 02:02.708
<c.speaker>Isa, learning how to master
my scepter is taking
longer than I thought.

02:02.708 --> 02:05.583
<c.speaker>But what if Shuriki
comes back while you're gone?

02:05.583 --> 02:08.583
<c.speaker>Well, Shuriki has
to figure out how
to use her scepter, too.

02:08.583 --> 02:11.208
<c.speaker>And I had a big head start.

02:11.208 --> 02:13.291
<c.speaker>I wish I didn't have to go,

02:13.291 --> 02:15.333
<c.speaker>but this is
the only way to make sure

02:15.333 --> 02:18.458
<c.speaker>I'm ready to face Shuriki
when the time comes.

02:18.458 --> 02:21.208
<c.speaker>I'm just trying
to keep you all safe.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.583
<c.speaker>[sighs]

02:22.583 --> 02:23.958
<c.speaker>I know.

02:27.291 --> 02:30.208
<c.speaker>Here. Take my bracelet.

02:30.208 --> 02:32.458
<c.speaker>For good luck.

02:32.458 --> 02:34.708
<c.speaker>Thanks, Isa.

02:34.708 --> 02:37.875
<c.speaker>I'm feeling lucky already.

02:39.875 --> 02:42.291
<c.speaker>I'll be back
as soon as I can.

02:42.291 --> 02:43.375
<c.speaker>Promise?

02:43.375 --> 02:45.125
<c.speaker>I promise.

<c.speaker>Oh! Aah!

03:21.083 --> 03:22.750
<c.speaker>Yeow!

03:22.750 --> 03:25.375
<c.speaker>These robes are brand new.

03:25.375 --> 03:27.208
<c.speaker>Forget your robes!
What about my tail?!

03:27.208 --> 03:29.458
<c.speaker>[blowing] Oh!

03:29.458 --> 03:32.708
<c.speaker>Hey, at least
you finally hit
something, Shuriki.

03:32.708 --> 03:35.458
<c.speaker>Shouldn't you be outside
standing guard, Troyo?

03:35.458 --> 03:37.250
<c.speaker>That's what I was doing.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.375
<c.speaker>And you might like to know
that Princess Elena
just flew past.

03:39.375 --> 03:41.750
<c.speaker>Excellent! I'll shoot her
out of the sky.

03:41.750 --> 03:43.333
<c.speaker>Cruz!

03:43.333 --> 03:44.458
<c.speaker>-Aah!
-Look out!

03:44.458 --> 03:46.458
<c.speaker>Shuriki,
you are not ready.

03:46.458 --> 03:48.291
<c.speaker>You must master
the scepter first.

03:50.416 --> 03:52.166
<c.speaker>Very well.

03:52.166 --> 03:55.083
<c.speaker>Cruz, follow Elena
and find out what she's up to.

03:55.083 --> 03:56.375
<c.speaker>Gladly!

03:56.375 --> 03:57.583
<c.speaker>Watch your tail, sis.

04:14.458 --> 04:15.500
<c.speaker>[sighs]

04:15.500 --> 04:18.416
<c.speaker>Okay. Let's go, Skylar.

04:41.875 --> 04:42.875
<c.speaker>Glow!

04:49.000 --> 04:50.416
<c.speaker>[loud thud]

04:50.416 --> 04:54.708
<c.speaker>Quita Moz?! I'm back
for my scepter training!

04:54.708 --> 04:56.333
<c.speaker>Quita Moz!

04:58.625 --> 05:01.125
<c.speaker>I heard you the first time.

05:01.125 --> 05:03.708
<c.speaker>Actually, I heard you
before the first time.

05:03.708 --> 05:05.000
<c.speaker>How could he know-- ?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.583
<c.speaker>The flames tell him
the future.

05:06.583 --> 05:07.625
<c.speaker>Oh, right.

05:07.625 --> 05:09.625
<c.speaker>Hey, can you tell
me my future?

05:09.625 --> 05:14.583
<c.speaker>Yes. You have somewhere
very, very important
to be right now.

05:14.583 --> 05:15.708
<c.speaker>Really? Where?

05:15.708 --> 05:18.125
<c.speaker>Anywhere but here!

05:18.125 --> 05:21.166
<c.speaker>Elena cannot have
any distractions once
we start training.

05:21.166 --> 05:22.708
<c.speaker>Oh. Skylar has to stay.

05:22.708 --> 05:24.458
<c.speaker>How else will
I get back to Avalor?

05:24.458 --> 05:27.250
<c.speaker>[sighs] I suppose
he can tag along.

05:27.250 --> 05:30.500
<c.speaker>If he promises to keep quiet
and stay out of the way.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.958
<c.speaker>Wait. Tag along?
Aren't we training?

05:32.958 --> 05:36.500
<c.speaker>Yes. But not here.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.375
<c.speaker>Hop on!

05:38.875 --> 05:40.458
<c.speaker>[Elena] Aah!

05:49.875 --> 05:51.000
<c.speaker>Where are we going?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.708
<c.speaker>To the Sunbird Sanctum,

05:52.708 --> 05:56.125
<c.speaker>where the last
of the sunbirds live.

05:56.125 --> 05:58.166
<c.speaker>I thought you were
the last of the sunbirds.

05:58.166 --> 06:01.208
<c.speaker>You thought wrong.
[chuckles]

06:05.708 --> 06:07.500
<c.speaker>Stay right behind me,
Skylar.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.375
<c.speaker>Unless you want
to take a shower.

06:22.625 --> 06:25.333
<c.speaker>This is
the Sunbird Sanctum.

06:25.333 --> 06:28.875
<c.speaker>Feel free to gasp
slowly in awe.

06:28.875 --> 06:30.583
<c.speaker>[both gasping]

06:30.583 --> 06:32.208
<c.speaker>Whoa.

06:37.625 --> 06:39.208
<c.speaker>Very good.

06:39.208 --> 06:41.000
<c.speaker>Now, this is
where your tour ends.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.458
<c.speaker>So wait for us here.

06:42.458 --> 06:45.583
<c.speaker>-But I--
-No distractions, remember?

06:45.583 --> 06:48.291
<c.speaker>Oookay.
Good luck, Princesa.

06:48.291 --> 06:51.416
<c.speaker>Now time to meet
the other sunbirds.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.583
<c.speaker>Wake up, sleepy heads!

07:00.583 --> 07:01.625
<c.speaker>I'm up, I'm up!

07:01.625 --> 07:03.708
<c.speaker>-Who's here?
-What now?

07:03.708 --> 07:07.875
<c.speaker>I want you birds to meet
Princess Elena of Avalor.

07:07.875 --> 07:09.458
<c.speaker>Hello!

07:09.458 --> 07:12.375
<c.speaker>Uh! Tell her to come back
next century.

07:13.583 --> 07:15.458
<c.speaker>That's Qapa.

07:15.458 --> 07:17.708
<c.speaker>He always wakes up on
the wrong side of the nest.

07:17.708 --> 07:20.125
<c.speaker>Did you say Princess?!

07:20.125 --> 07:22.166
<c.speaker>Oh, I've
always wanted to...

07:22.166 --> 07:24.500
<c.speaker>[snoring]

07:24.500 --> 07:28.583
<c.speaker>That's Hool. Sometimes,
she just falls asleep.

07:28.583 --> 07:30.625
<c.speaker>[snort]
...meet a princess!

07:30.625 --> 07:32.708
<c.speaker>-And wakes up again.
-[Elena laughs]

07:32.708 --> 07:35.583
<c.speaker>Last but not least,
this is Lama.

07:35.583 --> 07:37.083
<c.speaker>Pleasure to meet you, Lama.

07:37.083 --> 07:39.083
<c.speaker>Huh?
Who you calling mama?

07:39.083 --> 07:40.291
<c.speaker>Oh, I...

07:40.291 --> 07:42.708
<c.speaker>She's a little
hard of hearing.

07:42.708 --> 07:46.875
<c.speaker>Lama! Princess Elena is
here for scepter training!

07:46.875 --> 07:49.166
<c.speaker>It can't be raining.
We're inside.

07:49.166 --> 07:51.583
<c.speaker>No, she's here
for training!

07:51.583 --> 07:52.875
<c.speaker>Chaining?

07:52.875 --> 07:54.833
<c.speaker>-Training!
-Yeow!

07:54.833 --> 07:57.958
<c.speaker>Someone should train you
to use your indoor voice.

07:57.958 --> 07:59.625
<c.speaker>Oh. My apologies.

07:59.625 --> 08:00.833
<c.speaker>No, we don't have
any cheese.

08:00.833 --> 08:02.708
<c.speaker>Who is this?

08:02.708 --> 08:05.375
<c.speaker>Quita Moz,
when you asked us
to help train your pupil,

08:05.375 --> 08:07.750
<c.speaker>I was expecting someone,
I don't know,
a little older.

08:07.750 --> 08:09.708
<c.speaker>She's just a kid!

08:09.708 --> 08:13.208
<c.speaker>Sure, everyone's a child
when you're 500 years old.

08:13.208 --> 08:14.750
<c.speaker>I heard that.

08:14.750 --> 08:17.166
<c.speaker>Oh, now you can hear.

08:17.166 --> 08:18.583
<c.speaker>I'm up, I'm up.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.708
<c.speaker>So are we training her
or not?

08:20.708 --> 08:23.291
<c.speaker>We haven't decided yet.
Heads in.

08:25.750 --> 08:29.000
<c.speaker>[hushed murmurs]

08:29.000 --> 08:30.708
<c.speaker>How ya doin', Princess?

08:30.708 --> 08:32.958
<c.speaker>Zuzo?
What are you doing here?

08:32.958 --> 08:35.416
<c.speaker>I wanna learn more about
the Scepter of Light myself.

08:35.416 --> 08:36.708
<c.speaker>Did you start training yet?

08:36.708 --> 08:37.875
<c.speaker>Uh, I think
they're still deciding.

08:37.875 --> 08:39.625
<c.speaker>-[Qapa clears throat]
-[Elena gasps]

08:39.625 --> 08:43.458
<c.speaker>Do we have to train
your imaginary friend, too?

08:43.458 --> 08:44.833
<c.speaker>Oh... I'm not talking
to myself.

08:44.833 --> 08:47.458
<c.speaker>I can see my chanul.

08:49.166 --> 08:51.375
<c.speaker>-Ah!
-That's unusual.

08:51.375 --> 08:54.208
<c.speaker>Perhaps there is more
to her than meets the--

08:54.208 --> 08:56.208
<c.speaker>[snoring]

08:56.208 --> 08:58.500
<c.speaker>We will teach you
how to use--

08:58.500 --> 08:59.708
<c.speaker>Eye!

08:59.708 --> 09:02.625
<c.speaker>Ahem!
How to use the scepter.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.750
<c.speaker>[Elena] Great!

09:04.750 --> 09:06.833
<c.speaker>[Qapa] But there's something you
have to know before we start.

09:06.833 --> 09:07.833
<c.speaker>Aah!

09:07.833 --> 09:09.291
<c.speaker>What's that?

09:09.291 --> 09:11.708
<c.speaker>There is a big difference
between the Scepter of Light

09:11.708 --> 09:13.833
<c.speaker>and the Scepter of Night.

09:13.833 --> 09:15.583
<c.speaker>A lot more
than just the names.

09:15.583 --> 09:18.000
<c.speaker>He's right.
This is no game.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.833
<c.speaker>You sure you can
stay awake for this?

09:19.833 --> 09:22.125
<c.speaker>I could do this
in my sleep.

09:22.125 --> 09:25.375

11:15.958 --> 11:20.166
<c.speaker>♪ And let us begin. ♪

11:25.458 --> 11:29.750
<c.speaker>Your scepter
has many powers that
you have yet to discover.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.583
<c.speaker>So let's discover them
together, shall we?

11:32.583 --> 11:35.125
<c.speaker>We'll start with Farsight.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.458
<c.speaker>Farsight?

11:36.458 --> 11:38.625
<c.speaker>It lets you see someone,
wherever they are,

11:38.625 --> 11:41.416
<c.speaker>just by concentrating
on their name.

11:41.416 --> 11:43.458
<c.speaker>Ooh, this,
I've gotta see.

11:43.458 --> 11:45.500
<c.speaker>I'm gonna duck behind
that boulder over there,

11:45.500 --> 11:48.250
<c.speaker>and you tell me
what I'm doing.

11:48.250 --> 11:51.625
<c.speaker>Just hold up your scepter
and shout "Farsight,"

11:51.625 --> 11:55.250
<c.speaker>and then think "Hool."

11:55.250 --> 11:56.333
<c.speaker>Farsight!

12:04.000 --> 12:04.958
<c.speaker>[gasps]

12:04.958 --> 12:06.125
<c.speaker>Who is that?

12:06.125 --> 12:08.625
<c.speaker>My sister Isabel.

12:08.625 --> 12:10.000
<c.speaker>I guess I wasn't
thinking about Hool

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
<c.speaker>because I'm worried
about her. Sorry.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.583
<c.speaker>[Lama]
No, no, no, no, don't be.

12:14.583 --> 12:16.708
<c.speaker>My goodness, you saw
all the way to your palace.

12:16.708 --> 12:18.875
<c.speaker>That is very impressive
for your first try.

12:18.875 --> 12:21.583
<c.speaker>You see. I told you
her magic was strong.

12:21.583 --> 12:25.708
<c.speaker>But what's less impressive
is your lack of focus.

12:25.708 --> 12:29.000
<c.speaker>You're supposed to be
concentrating on Hool.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.500
<c.speaker>We don't need Farsight
to figure out
what Hool is doing.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.083
<c.speaker>[Hool snoring]

12:33.083 --> 12:34.416
<c.speaker>Ahh.

12:35.708 --> 12:37.458
<c.speaker>Try it again.

12:37.458 --> 12:38.708
<c.speaker>Farsight!

12:40.583 --> 12:43.500
<c.speaker>You actually did it.
Well done.

12:43.500 --> 12:47.000
<c.speaker>On to the next power.
We call this one Blaze.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.166
<c.speaker>Oh, I already know that one.

12:48.166 --> 12:51.166
<c.speaker>Ah, but
can you sustain it?

12:51.166 --> 12:53.583
<c.speaker>Sustain it?
What do you mean?

12:53.583 --> 12:54.958
<c.speaker>Shatter that rock!

12:58.208 --> 13:00.708
<c.speaker>[deep breath]

13:00.708 --> 13:02.000
<c.speaker>Blaze!

13:04.208 --> 13:05.875
<c.speaker>It's too big.

13:05.875 --> 13:09.000
<c.speaker>Not if you learn
how to sustain your blaze.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.208
<c.speaker>You can make it last longer
by keeping the word
in your mind.

13:13.208 --> 13:16.083
<c.speaker>Hold your focus,
and the blaze will sustain.

13:18.291 --> 13:19.333
<c.speaker>Blaze!

13:26.875 --> 13:28.166
<c.speaker>[exhales]

13:29.833 --> 13:33.291
<c.speaker>Sorry.
I was distracted... again.

13:33.291 --> 13:36.625
<c.speaker>You must focus
on the task at hand.

13:36.625 --> 13:38.625
<c.speaker>I know.

13:38.625 --> 13:40.750
<c.speaker>I need a break.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.875
<c.speaker>That's it.
Just take a little breather,

13:42.875 --> 13:44.458
<c.speaker>and you'll get 'em
next round.

13:44.458 --> 13:46.000
<c.speaker>Perhaps Lama was right.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.875
<c.speaker>Maybe she is too young.

13:48.875 --> 13:50.291
<c.speaker>[sighs]

13:53.833 --> 13:57.083
<c.speaker>[loud ricocheting]

13:57.083 --> 13:59.125
<c.speaker>Is it safe to come out?

13:59.125 --> 14:00.875
<c.speaker>See for yourself, Victor.

14:02.875 --> 14:03.958
<c.speaker>Ha!

14:05.583 --> 14:07.625
<c.speaker>-Ha ha!
-Nice shot, Shuriki!

14:07.625 --> 14:09.083
<c.speaker>[Troyo] That statue
didn't stand a chance.

14:09.083 --> 14:10.625
<c.speaker>Finally.

14:10.625 --> 14:13.333
<c.speaker>You underestimate me, Fiero.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.000
<c.speaker>I told you
there's no power

14:15.000 --> 14:17.333
<c.speaker>this scepter possesses
that I cannot master.

14:17.333 --> 14:18.958
<c.speaker>That's good to hear,

14:18.958 --> 14:21.125
<c.speaker>because Princess Elena
is in Vallestrella

14:21.125 --> 14:24.166
<c.speaker>being trained
on her scepter
by the sunbird elders.

14:24.166 --> 14:26.166
<c.speaker>They're still alive?

14:26.166 --> 14:28.083
<c.speaker>You see! Now
is the time to strike.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.875
<c.speaker>No more statues.

14:29.875 --> 14:32.875
<c.speaker>Teach me what
this scepter can really do.

14:32.875 --> 14:38.000
<c.speaker>Yes, Fiero, show Shuriki
the true power of the scepter.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.208
<c.speaker>Yeah. Why are you
holding out on her?

14:40.208 --> 14:42.000
<c.speaker>Patience, Shuriki.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.208
<c.speaker>You must master
the basics before--

14:44.208 --> 14:46.875
<c.speaker>What is the most destructive
power this scepter has?

14:46.875 --> 14:49.166
<c.speaker>Well, what is it?

14:49.166 --> 14:51.458
<c.speaker>Dark fire, I suppose,

14:51.458 --> 14:53.708
<c.speaker>but it is
far too difficult--

14:53.708 --> 14:55.125
<c.speaker>Show it to me now!

14:55.125 --> 14:56.708
<c.speaker>If we wait much longer,

14:56.708 --> 15:00.125
<c.speaker>Elena will master her scepter,
and we will all be ruined.

15:00.125 --> 15:04.000
<c.speaker>And you will never be
my royal malvago.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.958
<c.speaker>[sighs] The spell
for dark fire is Inferno.

15:07.958 --> 15:09.333
<c.speaker>But be very careful
because--

15:09.333 --> 15:10.958
<c.speaker>Inferno!

15:10.958 --> 15:12.000
<c.speaker>Whoa!

15:14.000 --> 15:16.458
<c.speaker>Oh! Why do I feel so weak?

15:16.458 --> 15:19.958
<c.speaker>The greater the power,
the more energy
it takes from you.

15:19.958 --> 15:21.708
<c.speaker>No pain, no gain, Shuriki.

15:21.708 --> 15:23.375
<c.speaker>So be it.

15:23.375 --> 15:25.208
<c.speaker>-Infer--
-No, no, no!

15:25.208 --> 15:28.625
<c.speaker>We don't want
to set the cave on fire.

15:30.250 --> 15:33.458
<c.speaker>Cruz, let's go
for a little ride.

15:34.958 --> 15:36.166
<c.speaker>Oh! Uh...

15:36.166 --> 15:38.125
<c.speaker>[sniffs, sighs]

15:42.333 --> 15:44.208
<c.speaker>Ready to give it another go?

15:44.208 --> 15:46.416
<c.speaker>Not really. [sighs]

15:46.416 --> 15:48.333
<c.speaker>Do you think Shuriki's
having this much trouble

15:48.333 --> 15:49.958
<c.speaker>learning the Scepter of Night?

15:49.958 --> 15:51.208
<c.speaker>I sure hope so.

15:51.208 --> 15:52.708
<c.speaker>Huh.

15:55.208 --> 15:57.875
<c.speaker>Wait! I can find out!

15:57.875 --> 15:59.458
<c.speaker>Farsight!

16:01.291 --> 16:02.375
<c.speaker>Shuriki.

16:02.375 --> 16:03.833
<c.speaker>She's at the Suncliff.

16:03.833 --> 16:05.458
<c.speaker>That's right outside
Avalor City.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.291
<c.speaker>I have to go!

16:07.291 --> 16:10.250
<c.speaker>Skylar,
take me back to Avalor.

16:10.250 --> 16:11.750
<c.speaker>Already?

16:11.750 --> 16:14.083
<c.speaker>-Elena, stop.
-Where are you going?

16:14.083 --> 16:15.291
<c.speaker>To defeat Shuriki!

16:15.291 --> 16:19.083
<c.speaker>You cannot cross scepters
with that sorceress.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.583
<c.speaker>You're not ready, dear.

16:20.583 --> 16:23.291
<c.speaker>You might wanna listen
to the sunbirds on this one.

16:23.291 --> 16:24.291
<c.speaker>Stay and train.

16:24.291 --> 16:26.166
<c.speaker>But I know
where she is, Zuzo.

16:26.166 --> 16:28.291
<c.speaker>This is my best chance
to stop her.

16:28.291 --> 16:31.166
<c.speaker>Skylar, let's fly!

16:31.166 --> 16:32.875
<c.speaker>Suit yourself.

16:38.458 --> 16:39.875
<c.speaker>Inferno!

16:41.833 --> 16:43.250
<c.speaker>[panting]

16:43.250 --> 16:44.708
<c.speaker>Look at it, Cruz.

16:44.708 --> 16:49.000
<c.speaker>The destructive power.
It's incredible.

16:53.416 --> 16:54.875
<c.speaker>Whoa, what was that?

16:54.875 --> 16:57.250
<c.speaker>It must be one
of her scepter powers.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.458
<c.speaker>Blaze!

16:58.458 --> 16:59.583
<c.speaker>[gasps]

17:01.458 --> 17:04.000
<c.speaker>I thought Elena
was in Vallestrella!

17:04.000 --> 17:05.500
<c.speaker>She was.

17:05.500 --> 17:08.458
<c.speaker>Yes! Well, I have
a little blaze of my own now.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.000
<c.speaker>Inferno!

17:10.000 --> 17:11.125
<c.speaker>[Skylar] Whoa!

17:13.250 --> 17:14.458
<c.speaker>Inferno!

17:15.708 --> 17:17.333
<c.speaker>[Skylar] Whoa!

17:17.333 --> 17:19.083
<c.speaker>-What do we do?
-Bank! Hard!

17:20.875 --> 17:22.333
<c.speaker>Blaze!

17:27.125 --> 17:28.458
<c.speaker>Rrr!

17:28.458 --> 17:31.625
<c.speaker>Skylar, I can't get
a clear shot!

17:31.625 --> 17:33.291
<c.speaker>Inferno!

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
<c.speaker>Inferno!

17:39.625 --> 17:43.208
<c.speaker>Look, Princesa! That scepter
drains her energy, too!

17:43.208 --> 17:44.291
<c.speaker>Now's your chance!

17:44.291 --> 17:47.083
<c.speaker>Whoa! Whoa!

17:47.083 --> 17:49.166
<c.speaker>We have to lose them,
Cruz.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.333
<c.speaker>The palace?

17:58.125 --> 18:00.416
<c.speaker>We chased them
to the palace?

18:00.416 --> 18:01.583
<c.speaker>No!

18:07.125 --> 18:10.375
<c.speaker>Oh, I'm--
I'm too weak to fight.

18:10.375 --> 18:13.500
<c.speaker>But this will keep
Elena busy.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.083
<c.speaker>Inferno.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.083
<c.speaker>[gasps]

18:27.208 --> 18:30.166
<c.speaker>Skylar!
Isa's in that tower!

18:32.458 --> 18:34.708
<c.speaker>What kind of fire is that?

18:34.708 --> 18:37.125
<c.speaker>Gabe! Isa's in there!

18:37.125 --> 18:38.958
<c.speaker>What?! I'll get her!

18:41.375 --> 18:42.458
<c.speaker>Isa!

18:42.458 --> 18:44.291
<c.speaker>[playing loudly]

18:46.125 --> 18:49.166
<c.speaker>I'm sorry, Princesa!
I can't get any closer!

18:52.416 --> 18:54.833
<c.speaker>Why didn't
I listen to the sunbirds?

18:56.583 --> 18:59.166
<c.speaker>This would've never happened
if I didn't come back.

18:59.166 --> 19:01.625
<c.speaker>You are one-hundred percent
right about that, yep.

19:01.625 --> 19:04.416
<c.speaker>Zuzo! Help me!
What do I do?!

19:04.416 --> 19:07.375
<c.speaker>Remember what the sunbirds
told you about the scepters?

19:07.375 --> 19:09.458
<c.speaker>I don't know.
They said a lot of stuff.

19:09.458 --> 19:13.375
<c.speaker>Then take a breath,
focus, and remember.

19:13.375 --> 19:15.000
<c.speaker>Okay, okay.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.458
<c.speaker>Uh, the Scepter of Light

19:17.458 --> 19:20.333
<c.speaker>and the Scepter of Night
have opposite powers.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.333
<c.speaker>Which means...

19:22.333 --> 19:25.291
<c.speaker>If Shuriki started this fire
with the Scepter of Night,

19:25.291 --> 19:26.833
<c.speaker>my scepter can stop it.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.875
<c.speaker>Exactly! You just
have to figure out how.

19:31.583 --> 19:32.750
<c.speaker>Uh...

19:32.750 --> 19:35.458
<c.speaker>Fight fire with fire!

19:35.458 --> 19:37.291
<c.speaker>That's gotta be the way.

19:37.291 --> 19:38.583
<c.speaker>Head for the flames, Skylar!

19:38.583 --> 19:39.583
<c.speaker>-Are you sure-- ?
-Go!

19:39.583 --> 19:41.250
<c.speaker>Okay!

19:44.708 --> 19:45.750
<c.speaker>Blaze!

19:48.458 --> 19:49.416
<c.speaker>[straining]

19:55.291 --> 19:56.458
<c.speaker>Isa...

19:58.458 --> 20:02.250
<c.speaker>Focus, Elena. You have
to sustain the blast.

20:02.250 --> 20:04.625
<c.speaker>Okay, okay.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
<c.speaker>Blaze!

20:21.875 --> 20:23.458
<c.speaker>-Unh!
-Whoa!

20:23.458 --> 20:24.708
<c.speaker>Gotcha!

20:24.708 --> 20:27.125
<c.speaker>Yes! Go, Elena!

20:27.125 --> 20:29.875
<c.speaker>Gabe, would you
keep it down out here?

20:29.875 --> 20:32.333
<c.speaker>I'm trying to practice
my guitardion.

20:32.333 --> 20:35.083
<c.speaker>[chuckles]
Okay, Isabel.

20:35.083 --> 20:36.458
<c.speaker>Isa!

20:36.458 --> 20:38.291
<c.speaker>Elena, you're back!

20:43.000 --> 20:45.416
<c.speaker>I warned you
that you were not ready.

20:45.416 --> 20:47.750
<c.speaker>We must leave
this place now.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.708
<c.speaker>We will disappear
into the jungle.

20:49.708 --> 20:53.416
<c.speaker>And we will not return
until you have fully
completed your training.

20:53.416 --> 20:56.500
<c.speaker>All things being equal,
I've done my share.

20:56.500 --> 20:57.875
<c.speaker>I'll be waiting
in my hideout

20:57.875 --> 20:59.750
<c.speaker>for you to crown me
king of the jungle.

21:04.625 --> 21:08.708
<c.speaker>Enjoy your small victory,
Princess.

21:08.708 --> 21:10.708
<c.speaker>It will be your last.

21:14.458 --> 21:15.875
<c.speaker>Farsight!

21:15.875 --> 21:17.500
<c.speaker>Huh.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.333
<c.speaker>Those trees don't grow
around here.

21:19.333 --> 21:21.875
<c.speaker>She must be deep
in the jungle.

21:21.875 --> 21:23.500
<c.speaker>Far from here.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.875
<c.speaker>I didn't know
your scepter could do that.

21:25.875 --> 21:27.500
<c.speaker>I just learned it today.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.833
<c.speaker>The scepter has
more powers than I thought.

21:29.833 --> 21:32.458
<c.speaker>Then you better get
back to Vallestrella

21:32.458 --> 21:34.000
<c.speaker>so you can learn
the rest of them.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.166
<c.speaker>What about you?

21:36.166 --> 21:38.416
<c.speaker>Don't worry about me.

21:38.416 --> 21:41.583
<c.speaker>Focus on mastering
that scepter.

21:41.583 --> 21:44.458
<c.speaker>It's the only way
to protect us.

21:44.458 --> 21:45.625
<c.speaker>I see that now.

21:47.708 --> 21:48.958
<c.speaker>I'll miss you.

21:48.958 --> 21:50.958
<c.speaker>I'll miss you, too.

21:50.958 --> 21:53.083
<c.speaker>You ready, Princesa?

21:53.083 --> 21:54.375
<c.speaker>Not yet.

21:56.333 --> 21:57.458
<c.speaker>But I will be.

22:03.625 --> 22:06.458
