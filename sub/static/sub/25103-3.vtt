But I wish youd have given us

02:53.710 --> 02:56.622
Unfortunately, all of
the articles we discussed,

02:56.670 --> 02:58.752
because they were
written for the Daily News,

taking you a little off guard,

03:22.360 --> 03:24.408
SO...

03:24.450 --> 03:26.827
why dont you just
take some time to regroup.

03:26.870 --> 03:29.498

the service aint been
the same around here.

12:15.810 --> 12:17.266
[mutters]

12:17.320 --> 12:19.276
So the interview.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.949
Yeah. PO sent him over.

12:22.990 --> 12:25.231
You thinking of hiring
a parolee?

12:27.160 --> 12:28.787
And he showed up late.

12:28.830 --> 12:30.695
Dressed like he was going
to a club.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.456
And he aint
have no experience.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.070
-So he was late and unprepared.
-Yeah.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.326
That sounds
vaguely familiar.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.086
-Ha.
-[laughs]

12:37.130 --> 12:39.542
I cant afford
to get this wrong.

12:39.590 --> 12:41.831
Might not be worth
all the trouble.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.677
Yeah, some folks said
the same thing about you,

12:43.720 --> 12:45.460
and they were dead wrong.

12:47.890 --> 12:49.551
[clears throat]

12:49.600 --> 12:50.965
Aunt Vi say you got a book deal
in the works.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.726
Whats that all about?

12:52.770 --> 12:54.510
You cant be the only one
out here hustling.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.471
So whats up? You want to let me
hold the dollar?

12:56.520 --> 12:57.805
Nah.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.856
Miss Parthena.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.481
Ralph Angel.

13:02.530 --> 13:04.486
-Good to see you.
-You too. Miss Nova.

13:04.530 --> 13:06.737
Been meaning
to thank your sister.

13:06.780 --> 13:09.442
I got back with Queen Sugar
for next season.

13:09.490 --> 13:11.867
That fixed rate
for the next five years,

13:11.910 --> 13:13.241
thats a godsend.

13:13.290 --> 13:14.826
-Yeah.
-And Sam,

13:14.870 --> 13:16.576
well, he aint
bothering us no more.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.279
So whatever Charley did
to make that work,

13:18.340 --> 13:19.784
we all real thankful.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.410
Glad to hear.

13:21.460 --> 13:23.007
Feels good to do business
with your own.

13:23.050 --> 13:24.415
Aint that the truth.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.999
You thank Charley

13:27.050 --> 13:28.597
Yes, maam, I will.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.210
Good seeing you.

13:31.430 --> 13:33.136
[clears throat]

13:33.180 --> 13:35.387
So, whatd Charley do
to get everyone back?

13:36.770 --> 13:38.510
She did what she do.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.063
Hustled. Got them back.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.936
So, what you
want me to say?

13:43.990 --> 13:45.810
Sam left them farmers alone,
aint he?

13:45.860 --> 13:47.600
Yeah, but howd
she do that?

13:48.780 --> 13:50.862
[laughs]

13:50.910 --> 13:52.696
You really not
going to say?

13:52.740 --> 13:54.116
What?

13:54.160 --> 13:55.536
Everythings fine.

13:55.580 --> 13:57.320
Charley got a plan,

13:57.370 --> 13:58.951
and the Landrys
aint going to see it coming.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.886
[indistinct chatter]

14:24.940 --> 14:27.488
Yo, Mr. West

14:27.530 --> 14:29.350
-Oh, from the game.

14:52.010 --> 14:53.716
Yo, so whats the plan later?

14:53.760 --> 14:54.966

14:56.430 --> 14:58.227
Yeah, sure.

14:58.270 --> 14:59.726
Yeah.

14:59.770 --> 15:01.180
You still remember
the spot, yeah?

15:01.230 --> 15:03.812
How can I forget?

15:03.860 --> 15:07.023
Young man, I need you to get
off the table and sit in a seat.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.351
[Malik]
Ooh.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.070
Man, he aint trying
to get close up to me

15:20.120 --> 15:21.621
and go down like
that other cop did.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.831
[Malik]
Man, that video was messed up.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.916
[KJ] _
Yo, you see the headline?

15:25.960 --> 15:27.951
"Local Hero Takes a Fall."

15:28.010 --> 15:29.716
-Man, local hero my ass.
-Exactly.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.751
"Racist Cop Exposed,"
more like it.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.711
[Asha]
Man, white people can beat
the hell out of people.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.422
Ki|| them, even, and then still
get called a local hero.

15:36.470 --> 15:38.768
But our sla_in brothers
and Sisters,

15:38.810 --> 15:40.801
they get demonized
and picked apart.

15:40.850 --> 15:42.977
-[KJ] Its crazy.
-[Asha] Im telling you, man,

15:43.020 --> 15:44.351
its messed up.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.719
You okay?

15:45.770 --> 15:47.397
-Hmm?
-You good?

15:47.440 --> 15:48.816
Yeah.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.191
So, whats this all about?

15:53.240 --> 15:55.151
You look really dope,
Aunt Vi.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.327
Because were going
to Hollywoods big reunion.

15:57.370 --> 16:00.407
Theres those soda waters
you like in that bottom drawer.

16:02.620 --> 16:05.248
-All right, Aunt Vi.
-[Violet] Okay.

16:05.290 --> 16:07.246
Are you doing business
with the Landrys?

16:09.130 --> 16:10.961
Whered you get
something like that from?

16:11.010 --> 16:12.329
I heard it from Rah.

16:16.050 --> 16:17.756
Whats she saying?

16:29.230 --> 16:30.436
[clears throat]

16:30.490 --> 16:31.980
Its true.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.021
I sold the mill for 1% equity
in Landry Enterprises.

16:36.070 --> 16:37.867
You sold the mill?

16:39.040 --> 16:40.940
Why would you sell--?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.786
Everything you went through
to get it off the ground.

16:42.830 --> 16:44.821
Everything those people
put you through.

16:44.870 --> 16:46.371
Put us through.

16:46.420 --> 16:47.956
Queen Sugar was about
to be ruined

16:48.000 --> 16:49.490
by that family
just on lies alone.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.916
I almost lost everything.

16:51.970 --> 16:56.339
But now my 1% is the first step
to taking back the power.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.130
[Nova]
So, you betray our family,

16:58.180 --> 17:00.808
get in bed with the enemy,
and all you got was 1%?

17:01.980 --> 17:03.436
Thats what were worth?

17:03.480 --> 17:04.845
[Charley]
I didnt betray anyone.

17:04.890 --> 17:06.141
And you aint try
and stop it?

17:06.190 --> 17:08.397
You knew about this?

17:08.440 --> 17:10.522
Yall aint seeing
the big picture.

17:10.570 --> 17:12.777
If Charley got a chance
to change things

17:12.820 --> 17:15.232
and take down
the Landrys,

17:15.280 --> 17:17.066
-I say she do it.
-You sound crazy.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.906
[Charley] You dont think
Ive thought this through?

17:18.950 --> 17:21.327
1% gets me access.

17:21.370 --> 17:23.531
And every day, that access
gives me information

17:23.580 --> 17:25.787
to bring this family
to their knees.

17:25.830 --> 17:27.661
Landrys in debt,
has been for years.

17:27.710 --> 17:29.166
And thats just the tip
of the iceberg.

17:29.210 --> 17:30.950
And when I have
all the pieces,

17:31.000 --> 17:34.413
I will destroy every
shareholder one by one

17:34.470 --> 17:37.086
until I own every stake
at this company.

17:37.140 --> 17:40.212
[Nova]
What you going to do
in the meantime, huh?

17:40.260 --> 17:42.057
Go to work every day?

17:42.100 --> 17:43.761
Sign another contract?

17:43.810 --> 17:45.596
Shake a black farmers hand?

17:45.640 --> 17:47.801
Smile in folks faces.
And its all a lie.

17:47.850 --> 17:49.477
[Charley]
Youre not listening, Nova.

17:49.520 --> 17:50.930
I cant barge
into Landry Enterprises

17:50.980 --> 17:52.311
without knowing
every backroom deal,

17:52.360 --> 17:53.987
every falsified report,

17:54.030 --> 17:56.021
every lawsuit
like the back of my hand.

17:56.070 --> 17:59.619
They cant see me coming,
because by the time they do

17:59.660 --> 18:02.788
Ill already be standing
on the ashes of Sams empire.

18:02.830 --> 18:04.866
You really think people
are going to care how I did it?

18:04.910 --> 18:07.117
Or are they just
going to say "thank you"?

18:07.170 --> 18:08.876
You need to wake up.
The games rigged.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.581
You cant win this way.

18:10.630 --> 18:13.872
I dont plan on winning
the game, Nova.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.968
I plan to eliminate it.

18:17.380 --> 18:18.961
Its what Daddy
wouldve wanted.

18:19.010 --> 18:21.092
You think this is what
Daddy wanted?

18:21.140 --> 18:22.880
Seriously, Charley?

18:22.930 --> 18:24.386
They killed him.

18:24.430 --> 18:26.341
And Im going
to make them pay.

18:26.390 --> 18:29.018
Im going to take
everything.

18:29.060 --> 18:30.220
I know what Im doing.

18:30.270 --> 18:31.726
You dont know shit.

18:31.770 --> 18:33.351
Nova...

18:33.400 --> 18:34.685
[Hollywood]
Landrys is cancer, Charley.

18:34.730 --> 18:36.641
You know this.

18:36.690 --> 18:39.989
I quit a good job because
Sams hands was all in it.

18:40.030 --> 18:42.908
Now, look here,
I may not be a Bordelon,

18:42.950 --> 18:45.157
-but even I walked away.
-Right. Youre not a Bordelon.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.612
-You did not just--
-Now you hold on right there.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.993
Hollywood is as much family as
anybody sitting at this table,

18:51.040 --> 18:53.281
and you ought
to pay attention

18:53.340 --> 18:56.207
when folks are trying
to talk some sense into you.

19:01.890 --> 19:04.302
I am the only person
at this table doing something,

19:04.350 --> 19:05.886
doing anything...

19:06.980 --> 19:08.629
for Daddy.

19:12.770 --> 19:14.260
-Come on, Micah. Were leaving.
-No,no.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.141
You need to sit down
and finish explaining

19:17.190 --> 19:19.146
how you think
sitting at a table

19:19.200 --> 19:22.567
with folks that have preyed
on your family for generations

19:22.620 --> 19:23.985
makes good sense.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.327
Micah, come on.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.706
Micah.

19:31.750 --> 19:35.083
Hey, there
Little sister

19:35.130 --> 19:36.950

19:38.880 --> 19:42.043

In the air?

19:43.300 --> 19:45.211
[door opens]

19:45.260 --> 19:47.216
[door slams]

19:47.270 --> 19:49.226
I know where youre from

19:50.600 --> 19:52.556
And you aint welcome here

19:52.600 --> 19:54.682
You better run

19:54.730 --> 19:56.470
Yall have a good time.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.317
Hang on, little sister

19:58.360 --> 19:59.645
[door opens]

19:59.690 --> 20:01.601
Theres no time

20:01.650 --> 20:03.561
[door closes]

20:03.620 --> 20:05.986
Just take a moment
Lets talk this out

20:12.330 --> 20:14.207
[cell phone vibrates]

20:20.720 --> 20:22.335
[Darla, on phone]
Hey, Ralph Angel...

20:22.380 --> 20:24.177
Hey, Im going to hand you

20:24.220 --> 20:26.131
Im about to go

20:26.180 --> 20:27.716

20:29.470 --> 20:31.051

20:31.100 --> 20:32.385
[Blue]
Hey!

20:32.440 --> 20:34.260
Hey! What are you doing?

20:34.310 --> 20:36.358
Were at Dads fishing job,
getting his money.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.686
Ooh, that sounds fun.

20:45.910 --> 20:47.616
-Hey! What up?
-[Ralph Angel] Yo.

20:47.660 --> 20:50.197
-Man, just coming for my check.
-All right.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.901
Could have used you at the game
the other night.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.246
Had it in the bag until
Johnny came through

20:54.290 --> 20:55.621
and messed it all up.

20:55.670 --> 20:57.456
No, Johnny won
fair and square.

20:57.500 --> 21:00.207
Youre just saying that
because he was your partner.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.218
I could beat you
with any partner.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.421
-[scoffs]
-Hi, Im Trinh.

21:04.470 --> 21:06.131
Ralph Angel.

21:06.180 --> 21:08.421
You the daughter

21:08.470 --> 21:10.131
I see Im famous.

21:10.180 --> 21:12.091
Yeah she went and got herself
a fancy degree

21:12.140 --> 21:14.552
so she dont have
to handle fish.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.807
Your mamas always talking
about you. Shes real proud.

21:16.850 --> 21:19.432
Now if she would just
say that to my face.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.220
Shes an Asian mom.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.316
Why would she tell you
shes proud to your face?

21:23.360 --> 21:25.100
You handing out checks now,
boss?

21:25.150 --> 21:26.947
Ma has the guys
go to the office.

21:26.990 --> 21:28.651
Just go tell them
I have their checks.

21:28.700 --> 21:30.019
[laughs]

21:31.870 --> 21:33.280
What was your
last name?

21:33.330 --> 21:34.957
Bordelon.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.127
Bordelon...

21:37.170 --> 21:39.377
Hope Khanh hasnt been running
off his mouth too much.

21:39.420 --> 21:42.048
No, he good.

21:42.090 --> 21:44.331
He actually showed me around
when I first got here.

21:44.380 --> 21:45.836
Khanhs smart.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.462
Hes a good worker...

21:48.510 --> 21:49.841
when he focuses.

21:51.430 --> 21:53.341
You going to tell him that
to his face?

21:54.430 --> 21:55.636
Touch.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.590
I got sisters.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.107
I know what its like
being the little bro.

22:00.150 --> 22:03.688
Big sisters just know how much
potential little brothers have.

22:06.530 --> 22:08.942
Ma said youve got a son.

22:09.910 --> 22:11.366
Yeah. Blue.

22:12.790 --> 22:13.905
Yeah, he in the car
