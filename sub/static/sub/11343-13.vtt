WEBVTT

00:01.242 --> 00:03.121
'In the criminal justice system,

00:03.163 --> 00:06.917
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.959 --> 00:10.922
'In New York City, the detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:10.964 --> 00:14.552
'are members of an elite squad,
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.594 --> 00:16.889
'These are their stories.'

00:18.516 --> 00:21.144
I got a great deal
on a George Foreman grill.

00:21.186 --> 00:23.606
EBay, one click, presto!

00:23.647 --> 00:26.985
Presto, what? Sloppy seconds
on a re-fried barbecue?

00:27.027 --> 00:30.948
- No way, this is good stuff, original.
- Then it's hot.

00:30.991 --> 00:33.327
Rise and shine, lovebirds.

00:34.370 --> 00:38.334
Blaupunkt radio. Log on to eBay,
it's yours for a song.

00:40.294 --> 00:43.507
No, they didn't take the radio,
they took his head off.

00:43.549 --> 00:45.259
And they took his pants, too.

00:47.429 --> 00:50.350
- Any spent rounds?
- A.44 in the gear-shift box.

00:50.391 --> 00:52.435
- Only one?
- So far.

00:52.477 --> 00:54.605
We did find fingerprints, though.

00:54.646 --> 00:57.192
Oh. Packed inside the emergency brake.

00:57.233 --> 00:59.403
He won't be using those any more.

00:59.445 --> 01:02.072
'Four o'clock. Love 30.'
Is that a meat market?

01:02.114 --> 01:05.242
Gym. Eastside.
More squash than treadmill.

01:05.995 --> 01:09.583
- Neighbours think they heard the shots.
- What did you hear?

01:09.625 --> 01:12.003
A high-pitched pop, hollow sounding.

01:12.045 --> 01:14.589
- Loud?
- Yeah, it woke up the baby.

01:14.631 --> 01:17.676
- But I didn't see anything.
- What time was that?

01:17.718 --> 01:21.724
2:00, 2:30. I heard it because
I had the window open.

01:21.766 --> 01:25.520
- In this weather?
- Our radiator's stuck on full.

01:25.562 --> 01:28.608
- May I give my statement, please?
- By all means.

01:28.649 --> 01:32.112
I'm sorry. It's just that the market
opened 20 minutes ago.

01:32.154 --> 01:35.033
- Please.
- I heard more of a boom.

01:35.992 --> 01:39.079
- A boom?
- Yes. Not a pop, a boom.

01:39.121 --> 01:44.295
- Why didn't you call the police?
- Gunshots, car alarms, helicopters, sirens.

01:44.337 --> 01:46.548
I'd be on the phone half my life.

02:35.987 --> 02:39.701
The body was found this morning,
shot through the back of the head.

02:39.743 --> 02:42.204
The victim was Dean Woodruff,
35 years old.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.749
He sold fitness equipment
on Lower Broadway.

02:44.791 --> 02:47.461
Divorced once.
Has an ex-wife, two kids upstate.

02:47.503 --> 02:49.547
- Girlfriend?
- We're looking.

02:49.589 --> 02:52.843
- His parents live near Saratoga.
- Any witnesses?

02:52.885 --> 02:55.805
A few heard a shot, but no eyewitnesses.

02:55.847 --> 02:59.477
- It was between 2:00 and 2:30.
- The victim in his own car?

02:59.518 --> 03:02.397
His sales region covers upstate and Jersey.

03:02.439 --> 03:05.526
One.44 slug
was recovered from the gearbox.

03:05.568 --> 03:08.322
.44. The shooter
was either a wacko or insecure.

03:08.364 --> 03:10.992
- Insecure?
- It's overkill and messy.

03:11.034 --> 03:14.580
- An amateur?
- A pro shoots twice with a.22.

03:14.622 --> 03:17.000
It's neat and you don't wake up babies.

03:17.042 --> 03:19.086
The scene is a big grope spot.

03:19.127 --> 03:22.090
Romantic.
Teenagers, honeymooners, co-workers.

03:22.131 --> 03:23.967
So, where's his love interest?

03:24.009 --> 03:27.055
- We're running down the prints.
- Maybe he was alone.

03:27.096 --> 03:29.975
Maybe his pants came off
from the force of the shot.

03:30.017 --> 03:34.314
He could have been having safe sex
with himself. Safe till he got shot.

03:34.356 --> 03:37.735
They've just started to pick through
the hair and glass.

03:37.777 --> 03:40.948
But I assume COD was a gunshot wound
to the back of the head.

03:40.989 --> 03:44.160
- Yeah, what's left of it.
- Is this bruises or lividity?

03:44.202 --> 03:46.246
I'd say it's just pooling.

03:46.288 --> 03:48.750
- Consistent with the 2:30 TOD?
- Mm-hm.

03:48.792 --> 03:51.044
- Under the fingernails?
- Dirt.

03:51.086 --> 03:54.549
You know his er... drawers were down.

03:54.591 --> 03:57.637
There's semen but don't get too excited.

03:57.678 --> 04:01.350
It could be part of the body's
natural death reflex.

04:04.479 --> 04:08.442
It's never too late to fulfil
that New Year's resolution. Welcome.

04:08.484 --> 04:11.029
I work out, just with different muscles.

04:11.071 --> 04:13.157
Detectives Jeffries and Munch.

04:13.199 --> 04:15.743
- You're here about Dean.
- Yes.

04:19.247 --> 04:21.334
Dean was more faithful than my wife.

04:22.377 --> 04:26.299
When he was in the city,
he came in early every day, 7:30.

04:26.341 --> 04:29.053
Took short lunches, didn't leave till late.

04:29.095 --> 04:33.308
Wow. Work macht frei.
What about on the road?

04:33.350 --> 04:36.771
He checked in often,
more than made his quota.

04:36.813 --> 04:39.191
- He was a good friend.
- Well-liked?

04:39.233 --> 04:42.529
Once he made a deal with a gym,
people would only deal with him.

04:42.570 --> 04:45.324
He had the largest
private client base of anyone.

04:45.366 --> 04:48.370
- We'll need a copy of that list.
- Of course.

04:48.411 --> 04:53.669
Excuse me. This is upsetting.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.254
It's unreal.

04:56.296 --> 05:00.427
You never think something like this
will happen to someone you know.

05:00.469 --> 05:04.265
- The two of you were friends?
- It's a close-knit group.

05:04.307 --> 05:06.977
But Dean was special.

05:07.019 --> 05:11.066
- Special how?
- He was popular around the office.

05:11.108 --> 05:14.237
- We'd all go out for drinks.
- Where would you go?

05:15.781 --> 05:17.866
Mostly to Le Bar.

05:20.828 --> 05:24.333
Let me guess,
he knocked the wrong person up

05:24.375 --> 05:26.419
or skipped out on alimony.

05:26.461 --> 05:29.632
- He had a way with women?
- Great technique.

05:29.674 --> 05:32.135
He compliments them on their shoes?

05:32.177 --> 05:35.181
He nurses a drink, looks sad.
She asks him what's wrong.

05:35.223 --> 05:39.019
He says his heart is breaking,
will he ever love again?

05:39.061 --> 05:41.106
It works every time.

05:41.147 --> 05:43.441
So, what happened?

05:44.777 --> 05:48.532
- So, last night, he died.
- Oh.

05:48.573 --> 05:52.411
Oh, but he was just in here last night.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.498
Do you know what time he left?

05:54.540 --> 05:59.128
I ran his card at... 11:55pm.

05:59.170 --> 06:04.177
God, he tipped 25 per cent.
He was the nicest guy.

06:04.219 --> 06:08.599
He used his expense account for four
vodka gimlets, two cosmopolitans.

06:08.641 --> 06:11.520
One Roadkill. Who'd he leave with?

06:11.561 --> 06:13.231
The women that come here?

06:13.272 --> 06:16.527
They're all thin and hungry
with cellphones attached.

06:16.568 --> 06:18.947
It could have been anyone.

06:18.988 --> 06:23.202
No, perfect. The only problem I had
with the guy was with his keys.

06:23.244 --> 06:26.122
- Keys?
- He gave away his key too easy.

06:26.164 --> 06:29.627
- I don't mean that he was easy.
- No, he was helping the homeless.

06:30.671 --> 06:34.384
Pretty much every woman,
and there were a lot of women,

06:34.425 --> 06:36.094
each left with her own key.

06:36.135 --> 06:40.058
Then things would go bad between them
so he'd change the lock.

06:40.100 --> 06:44.021
He paid for it but you're supposed
to go through management.

06:44.063 --> 06:46.274
Here we go.

06:46.316 --> 06:48.402
Hotel matches.

06:49.236 --> 06:52.991
Seashells. Cocktail napkins?

06:53.033 --> 06:56.955
- Souvenirs. How anal retentive.
- It's like he's expecting an audit.

06:56.996 --> 06:59.834
So some woman could tell him
he didn't give enough?

06:59.875 --> 07:03.880
- I'm sure he didn't have to wait.
- 'Our love is like the tide...'

07:03.922 --> 07:06.425
And now the tide is out.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.597
Hello?

07:10.639 --> 07:13.142
- Hello!
- Give me that.

07:15.521 --> 07:17.481
This is Detective Jeffries.

07:18.566 --> 07:20.026
Mm-hm.

07:22.863 --> 07:24.950
Excellent. Yeah. Thanks.

07:25.992 --> 07:29.080
Moira Shannon had not one
but two gun permits.

07:29.122 --> 07:32.793
- Either of them a.44?
- Yeah, and for a 9mm. No priors.

07:33.837 --> 07:35.922
What a past.

07:37.633 --> 07:40.720
Look at this. It's Moira.

07:40.762 --> 07:44.475
- She looks so happy there.
- She ain't happy no more.

07:44.517 --> 07:47.980
I haven't set foot into Le Bar in months.

07:48.021 --> 07:51.442
- You said it was your regular hang.
- Was.

07:51.484 --> 07:53.946
Not after he dumped me.

07:55.782 --> 07:58.159
- You have two gun permits.
- Yes.

07:58.202 --> 08:02.624
Look, I'm from upstate, it...

08:02.666 --> 08:05.628
It was one of the things
he and I had in common.

08:05.670 --> 08:08.507
My dad taught me to hunt.
I've always carried a gun.

08:08.549 --> 08:11.761
But you do have a.44 and a 9mm?

08:11.803 --> 08:16.392
The.44, that was just a phase.
It's a cannon, so impractical.

08:16.433 --> 08:19.980
The Glock is more user-friendly.
What did you do with the cannon?

08:20.021 --> 08:22.066
Sold it about a year after I got it.

08:22.108 --> 08:24.653
- Do you have a receipt?
- At home.

08:24.695 --> 08:27.365
I sold it to a gun shop in Duchess County.

08:27.407 --> 08:30.327
Is this the woman who left
with Mr Woodruff last night?

08:31.537 --> 08:35.751
- The vodka tonic, she's old news.
- OK, well, maybe one of these.

08:35.793 --> 08:38.754
I've tried to be helpful but I don't need this.

08:38.796 --> 08:41.799
- You're busy. We can come back.
- God, you people!

08:41.842 --> 08:44.220
Her, then me.

08:44.261 --> 08:48.142
The blonde, then me.
Some preppy little anorexic girl, then me.

08:48.183 --> 08:51.271
It wasn't you that left with him,
by any chance?

08:51.312 --> 08:53.941
She was over at their table for a while.

08:53.983 --> 08:57.195
They all come from the same
Upper Eastside gene pool.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.948
I'd never seen this one before.

08:58.990 --> 09:02.035
Usually Dean had to work
his line of tragic BS

09:02.077 --> 09:04.330
for a good ten minutes before he scored.

09:04.372 --> 09:08.252
With this one,
he hardly had to open his mouth.

09:08.293 --> 09:10.505
Anybody know this guy?

09:10.547 --> 09:13.300
Don't you mean excuse me for interrupting?

09:13.342 --> 09:15.428
Hey! Just...

09:15.469 --> 09:19.600
- Do you know this guy, hotshot?
- Should I?

09:19.642 --> 09:22.228
You want your collarbone in one piece, yes?

09:22.270 --> 09:25.440
Let's start again.
We're two of New York's finest.

09:25.482 --> 09:29.530
We'd like you to forget about
these kamikazes and pay attention.

09:33.702 --> 09:37.206
Oh, yeah, massive pecs, washboard abs.

09:37.248 --> 09:40.252
I called him the Willy Loman of dumbbells,

09:40.294 --> 09:43.506
which he didn't appreciate,
or else didn't get.

09:43.548 --> 09:46.010
Who did appreciate those quadriceps?

09:48.013 --> 09:50.098
One of the Mulroneys.

09:52.184 --> 09:54.855
Counting cousins and in-laws,
it's a huge clan.

09:54.896 --> 09:57.733
Of the daughters,
Stephanie's the only one left.

09:57.775 --> 10:01.780
She's something of a wild child.
Drunken rowdiness, college stuff,

10:01.822 --> 10:04.325
a possession bust
got her community service.

10:04.367 --> 10:07.204
Community service?
That's what Mulroneys do.

10:07.246 --> 10:10.959
Now she's 33 and runs some
socially-conscious investment group.

10:11.001 --> 10:14.839
Don't tell me. One cent
on every cigarette pack the family makes

10:14.880 --> 10:16.800
goes into lung cancer research?

10:16.842 --> 10:20.096
- Let's keep politics out of this.
- Good luck.

10:20.138 --> 10:23.851
Public service hides a multitude of sins,
some venial, some mortal.

10:23.892 --> 10:27.397
Right now she is
a reluctant witness, nothing more.

10:27.439 --> 10:29.900
If she just picked him up,
she'd be reluctant.

10:29.942 --> 10:32.737
The family has gone through
more than their share.

10:32.779 --> 10:35.116
You left a note at her apartment when?

10:35.158 --> 10:39.746
Er, three hours ago. We also left
a number of messages on her machine.

10:39.788 --> 10:43.668
Captain, there's some big mouthpiece
waiting for you in your office.

10:43.710 --> 10:47.299
- He wouldn't wait outside.
- Think Chappaquiddick, my friends.

10:47.340 --> 10:50.469
- These people don't talk.
- His name's Rumsey.

10:50.511 --> 10:54.808
Former Governor Mulroney's legal advisor.
That Rumsey?

10:56.936 --> 10:59.272
Memory lane.

10:59.313 --> 11:04.154
A lot of friends have served the city
honourably and well, Captain Cragen.

11:04.195 --> 11:06.115
I'm Patrick Rumsey.

11:06.157 --> 11:09.161
I assume you're here
to represent Miss Mulroney.

11:09.202 --> 11:12.582
I'm here as a family friend.
Stephanie witnessed the attack.

11:12.623 --> 11:17.629
- I'm offering to help.
- We want to interview Miss Mulroney.

11:17.671 --> 11:19.716
I understand, Captain.

11:19.757 --> 11:23.721
Meanwhile, I have a copy
of her statement here.

11:26.474 --> 11:28.269
Her statement?

11:28.311 --> 11:30.897
To give you the facts
while her memory is fresh.

11:30.939 --> 11:35.570
Thank you for your help, Mr Rumsey,
but we'll take our own statement.

11:35.611 --> 11:38.323
Of course, as soon as she's ready.

11:45.749 --> 11:49.797
Munch says they make 18 cents
for every pack of cigarettes sold.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.674
That's one of the rumours.

11:51.716 --> 11:55.846
And when the eldest daughter died,
2,000 mourners lined Fifth Avenue.

11:55.889 --> 11:59.852
- Munch says a lot so Cragen sent us.
- What's this?

12:01.478 --> 12:04.691
It's a cigar cutter.
Look, Winston Churchill, 1929.

12:04.733 --> 12:07.737
The real story is
Winnie lost it in a poker game.

12:07.778 --> 12:10.032
Churchill never carried much cash.

12:10.073 --> 12:13.786
And my father-in-law never extended credit.
Regina Mulroney.

12:13.828 --> 12:16.248
- Detective Benson.
- Detective Stabler.

12:17.917 --> 12:20.253
This is the worst sort of déjà vu.

12:21.589 --> 12:25.719
Every time a policeman has come to
our house, a family member has died.

12:25.760 --> 12:28.973
It's five years to the day
since my son went down

12:29.015 --> 12:33.145
in the fog off the Dalmatian coast
with the ambassador.

12:33.186 --> 12:36.775
- Your daughter was very lucky.
- Lucky? How?

12:36.817 --> 12:38.902
That she survived the attack.

12:38.944 --> 12:41.531
Oh, yes.

12:41.573 --> 12:44.076
My unplanned miracle child.

12:44.118 --> 12:47.581
- The light of my life.
- Is Stephanie here, Mrs Mulroney?

12:47.622 --> 12:51.169
- She has her own apartment.
- Yes, we know. We've been there.

12:51.210 --> 12:54.256
But children always go home
during a crisis, don't they?

12:54.298 --> 12:58.011
Yes, but I'm afraid she's in seclusion.

12:58.052 --> 13:01.265
- Where exactly? The Hamptons?
- No.

13:01.307 --> 13:03.935
In a private hospital. She's under sedation.

13:03.977 --> 13:07.398
Well, if you'd call her,
we won't overstay our welcome.

13:11.571 --> 13:14.950
Look, I'm a little uneasy.
This is a private clinic.

13:14.992 --> 13:17.662
Endowed by the Mulroneys. We get it.

13:18.538 --> 13:20.833
We admitted her early yesterday morning.

13:20.875 --> 13:23.419
- Where's her clothing?
- I beg your pardon?

13:23.462 --> 13:26.758
The clothes she wore
the night of the homicide.

13:26.799 --> 13:29.845
I believe she had changed
before she was admitted.

13:29.887 --> 13:33.391
- Admitted for what?
- Trauma, Detective.

13:33.433 --> 13:36.687
We treated the wounds and gave her
Seconal to calm her down.

13:37.771 --> 13:40.317
- We'll be brief, Miss Mulroney.
- I'm fine.

13:40.358 --> 13:41.818
And to the point.

13:43.905 --> 13:45.365
Thank you.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.828
Did you leave Le Bar
with Dean Woodruff?

13:49.871 --> 13:51.205
Yes.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.168
- And what time was that?
- I don't remember.

13:54.209 --> 13:56.129
Is that where you met him?

13:58.132 --> 14:00.384
I was having a rough day.

14:00.426 --> 14:02.888
He said he'd been having a rough day, too.

14:02.929 --> 14:06.684
OK, so you left the bar with him.
What happened in the car?

14:06.726 --> 14:10.857
He was leaning against the window
in the driver's seat facing me.

14:10.899 --> 14:14.737
He'd made a joke about
the disadvantages of bucket seats.

14:14.778 --> 14:16.865
Explain the joke?

14:17.949 --> 14:20.203
It's rather obvious, isn't it?

14:20.244 --> 14:24.333
Stephanie told him, 'Not so fast',
or something. Isn't that right?

14:27.211 --> 14:31.050
- Is that what you said?
- Something like that.

14:31.091 --> 14:34.387
I leaned over to change the radio station.

14:34.429 --> 14:37.892
What was playing?

14:37.933 --> 14:43.024
I don't know. And then it happened.

14:43.065 --> 14:45.360
Then what happened?

14:45.402 --> 14:47.821
The shooting occurred.

14:48.823 --> 14:50.992
What time was that?

14:51.869 --> 14:54.748
Can't remember?

14:54.789 --> 14:58.461
Can you describe the person
who did the shooting, Miss Mulroney?

14:59.545 --> 15:04.093
A man came up fast. Before
I could say anything, he had a gun out.

15:04.135 --> 15:07.640
- It was so loud!
- That's enough.

15:07.681 --> 15:11.353
- Did you get a look at him?
- He had black-rimmed glasses,

15:12.437 --> 15:15.566
dark hair and a roundish face.

15:15.608 --> 15:19.238
- How tall was he?
- I don't know. It was dark.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.491
But he was wearing glasses?

15:21.532 --> 15:24.786
White man, medium height,
black-rimmed glasses.

15:25.830 --> 15:27.999
- Anything else, Detective?
- Yes.

15:28.041 --> 15:31.963
- Why didn't you call the police?
- It was so awful.

15:32.005 --> 15:34.716
You have no idea how awful it was.

15:36.969 --> 15:38.889
Thank you for coming.

15:39.723 --> 15:44.229
- Her story check out?
- She says it was a sneak attack.

15:44.271 --> 15:48.526
Consistent with the medical exam,
one shot from outside the car.

15:48.568 --> 15:51.447
- Other than that, it's her word...
- Against ours.

15:51.489 --> 15:56.203
Those were not wagon trains circled
around Stephanie. Those were tanks.

15:56.244 --> 15:59.290
- Did she see the shooter?
- Good enough to do a composite.

15:59.332 --> 16:02.252
- OK, did they have sex?
- Stephanie implied no.

16:02.294 --> 16:05.173
- Does no mean yes?
- They are a family of politicians.

16:05.215 --> 16:08.177
- As in liars.
- Let's get an order for a DNA swab.

16:08.219 --> 16:12.767
- What for? She says she was in the car.
- One Police Plaza all over you?

16:12.808 --> 16:15.394
Sympathy for the Mulroney family
runs high.

16:16.438 --> 16:20.276
OK, she was in the car.
What about outside motives?

16:20.318 --> 16:24.740
- Women, lots and lots of women.
- Then there's gonna be jealousy.

16:24.782 --> 16:28.662
Ex-wife lives upstate.
Woman he betrayed the most.

16:28.704 --> 16:31.792
That many women, must be boyfriends.
Check 'em out.

16:31.833 --> 16:34.462
- Munch, Jeffries, ballistics.
- You got it.

16:35.755 --> 16:38.717
- Black Talon.
- He was shot with a Black Talon?

16:38.759 --> 16:43.389
- Cop killers. Not made since 1994.
- Cos they killed too many cops.

16:43.431 --> 16:46.310
The real reason was
it was instantly recognisable.

16:46.352 --> 16:48.396
Bullet-makers want anonymity.

16:48.438 --> 16:51.859
If you can't prove where a bullet
was made, you can't sue.

16:51.901 --> 16:55.238
- Where would we be without lawyers?
- Thanks.

16:57.158 --> 16:59.828
The last straw was a sophomore

16:59.870 --> 17:02.415
who stopped by to return Dean's books.

17:03.458 --> 17:05.544
Some Greek philosophy.

17:07.630 --> 17:10.467
- As if.
- Are you still angry?

17:11.510 --> 17:14.180
Not really.

17:14.222 --> 17:17.809
Dean's dad worked in the lumberyard.
Drove a skip-lader.

17:17.851 --> 17:21.941
The kid helped out.
Before long, he was running the office.

17:21.982 --> 17:25.862
- Sounds like quite a schmoozer.
- Everything was a transaction.

17:25.904 --> 17:29.033
Sales, where to go to dinner,
what movie to see.

17:29.075 --> 17:32.371
But none of it was good enough
for the old man.

17:32.412 --> 17:36.542
I think that's why
Dean chased so many women.

17:36.584 --> 17:39.171
It wasn't hard for him to meet college girls?

17:39.213 --> 17:41.549
Hard wasn't Dean's problem.

17:42.592 --> 17:46.348
- Before the college went co-ed...
- A lot of girls.

17:46.389 --> 17:48.475
A lot of transactions.

17:50.937 --> 17:54.983
We were one of the first colleges
to regulate intimacy.

17:55.025 --> 17:58.781
- Make-out rules?
- Date rape happens on every campus.

17:58.822 --> 18:02.160
We hoped these rules
would stop it from happening.

18:02.202 --> 18:04.746
Then they turned into some sort of PC joke.

18:04.788 --> 18:08.627
- Dean was involved in date rapes?
- That's the whole point.

18:08.669 --> 18:13.091
Earlier generations would have
admired him for being a lady's man.

18:13.132 --> 18:17.972
Lady-killer, Lothario, only recently
have those terms become pejorative.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.559
So, none of his partners ever complained?

18:20.601 --> 18:23.145
Well, there were always rumours but...

18:23.187 --> 18:27.193
Look, we have many prominent
families among our alumni.

18:27.235 --> 18:30.531
They consider discretion
the better part of valour.

18:30.572 --> 18:33.117
The Mulroney family's notoriously discreet.

18:33.159 --> 18:35.703
We know that Stephanie dropped out.

18:35.745 --> 18:39.334
- Did Dean Woodruff factor into that?
- I'd rather not say.

18:39.376 --> 18:42.880
- Look, this is very awkward...
- Why don't we stop the crap?

18:42.922 --> 18:47.094
Was there a rumour of a sexual nature
between Stephanie and Dean?

18:48.637 --> 18:51.099
She came to me and cried rape.

18:51.140 --> 18:53.685
- Mm-hm.
- But the story never added up.

18:53.727 --> 18:58.317
He seduced her. He treated her shabbily.
No more, no less.

18:58.359 --> 19:01.028
So, she's a pathological liar, or what?

19:01.070 --> 19:03.156
She was a bright girl.

19:04.199 --> 19:07.913
- The burden was too much for her.
- What burden?

19:07.955 --> 19:10.457
The burden of being a Mulroney.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.964
Based on your brief description
of the assailant,

19:15.005 --> 19:17.467
we have this preliminary composite.

19:18.593 --> 19:20.346
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

19:20.388 --> 19:23.099
- It's him.
- You don't want to change anything?

19:23.141 --> 19:27.397
Excuse me, Detective, just what
part of 'yes' don't you understand?

19:27.438 --> 19:29.483
The part about Barrett College.

19:29.525 --> 19:32.612
Miss Mulroney, when you asked her

19:32.654 --> 19:36.575
if she met Dean Woodruff in Le Bar
the night of the incident,

19:36.617 --> 19:38.745
nodded in the affirmative.

19:38.787 --> 19:41.414
But she actually met him
in her sophomore year.

19:41.706 --> 19:44.126
- She knew him.
- Intimately, we were told.

19:44.168 --> 19:46.964
- That wasn't the question.
- But it is now.

19:47.005 --> 19:50.677
- I ran into him at the bar, OK?
- That's enough.

19:50.718 --> 19:54.683
Captain Cragen,
we all want the same thing here.

19:54.724 --> 19:57.143
- Yes, ma'am, the truth.
- Well said.

19:57.185 --> 20:02.025
Are you making an identification
or a martyr out of my daughter?

20:02.067 --> 20:04.987
This family really doesn't need
any more martyrs.

20:10.703 --> 20:13.249
The Nuclear Medicine Wing
at Bronx General.

20:13.290 --> 20:16.168
Mulroney Chair in Public Policy
at the New School.

20:16.210 --> 20:20.383
And paying for the restoration
of half the structures in the park.

20:20.424 --> 20:23.387
My God, Senator Mulroney
was instrumental

20:23.428 --> 20:26.474
in getting sex-crime legislation
passed in the Senate.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.559
For which we're eternally grateful.

20:28.601 --> 20:31.940
Don't be facetious.
We're up against some very big guns.

20:31.981 --> 20:36.779
I've met the matriarch and lawyer.
Adam, this girl's story is a mess.

20:36.821 --> 20:41.159
She was in shock.
What's the motive, by the way?

20:41.201 --> 20:43.496
She was involved with the victim.

20:43.538 --> 20:47.334
Now, maybe he date-raped her.
Maybe he just forgot to call.

20:47.376 --> 20:51.966
Either way, she was mortified.
We think she stewed for years...

20:52.007 --> 20:53.676
You think?

20:53.717 --> 20:56.846
She ran into him,
allowed herself to be picked up...

20:56.888 --> 21:02.062
So, she could neck him, jump out
and shoot him, while he sat still?

21:02.104 --> 21:06.652
This girl is no stranger to trouble.
She's been arrested for cocaine.

21:06.694 --> 21:09.948
Possession. This is murder, for God's sake.

21:09.989 --> 21:12.242
Find the weapon, make the case.

21:12.283 --> 21:16.706
We have a case!
We have motive. We have opportunity.

21:16.748 --> 21:19.794
What about means? Where's the gun?

21:19.836 --> 21:22.756
Maybe in the Hudson River.
Maybe the East River.

21:24.842 --> 21:26.886
Sir, all due respect,

21:26.928 --> 21:31.601
90 per cent of murderers you put in Attica
are there without a murder weapon.

21:31.643 --> 21:33.728
Talk to McCoy.

21:35.481 --> 21:36.941
Thank you.

21:42.740 --> 21:45.536
Cocaine users are prone
to distorting the truth.

21:45.577 --> 21:48.456
She lied to us
about when she met the victim.

21:48.498 --> 21:52.545
She lied about her trauma
so Mommy could put her on ice.

21:52.586 --> 21:55.006
Hail, Regina, Queen of the Mulroney clan.

21:55.048 --> 21:57.426
I've had it up to here with these people.

21:57.468 --> 22:00.681
- What about the shooter composite?
- What about it?

22:00.722 --> 22:03.601
Well, it's based on her eyewitness account.

22:03.643 --> 22:06.313
- Where does that leave you?
- With her.

22:06.355 --> 22:08.816
We think she's the shooter.

22:10.735 --> 22:13.114
Like I told Schiff, motive, opportunity.

22:13.155 --> 22:17.703
She told us she was changing
the radio station when the guy appeared.

22:17.744 --> 22:20.164
She can't remember what song was playing.

22:20.206 --> 22:24.253
You change the radio station
when something annoys you.

22:24.294 --> 22:26.423
She's zooming us, Jack.

22:29.135 --> 22:32.681
A.44's a big gun.

22:32.722 --> 22:36.769
The whole idea of her shooting him
from behind begs credulity.

22:36.811 --> 22:39.398
She didn't have to pull the trigger.

22:40.483 --> 22:44.613
I'll have to deal with damage control
with Schiff and the press

22:44.655 --> 22:47.200
and security after the arraignment.

22:47.242 --> 22:50.746
These are powerful people.
They are magnets for weirdos.

22:50.788 --> 22:53.250
You're going for it?

22:55.210 --> 22:57.588
Making false statements.

22:57.630 --> 23:00.843
Luring a guy to his death for revenge.

23:01.885 --> 23:03.930
We'll go murder two.

23:03.972 --> 23:06.350
Then we'll flip her on the shooter.

23:10.021 --> 23:12.483
Docket number 99467.

23:12.525 --> 23:15.779
The people of the state of New York
v Stephanie Mulroney.

23:15.821 --> 23:18.408
The charge is second-degree murder.

23:19.492 --> 23:23.330
- How do you plead?
- Your Honour. Before she answers,

23:23.372 --> 23:26.459
I'd like to ask the court
to remove the restraints.

23:26.501 --> 23:28.963
Please, out of respect.

23:29.005 --> 23:31.508
As a gentleman, I'll agree.

23:46.278 --> 23:48.655
My client pleads not guilty.

23:48.697 --> 23:51.868
- I assume the People ask for bail.
- We ask for remand.

23:51.909 --> 23:53.745
You're joking.

23:53.787 --> 23:58.293
The defendant's family obtained
an expedited passport for her.

23:58.335 --> 24:01.756
Also, she has unlimited financial resources.

24:01.798 --> 24:04.467
I think we're all aware of that,
Miss Carmichael.

24:04.509 --> 24:07.179
Therefore we see her
as a serious flight risk.

24:07.221 --> 24:10.350
- Your Honour, this is incredible.
- I agree.

24:11.394 --> 24:13.771
I find it incredible

24:13.813 --> 24:18.194
that this woman has so lowered
the standards by which she was raised.

24:18.236 --> 24:21.240
I believe she might
put herself above the law.

24:21.282 --> 24:26.121
I don't intend to have Miss Mulroney
gallivanting around Europe.

24:26.163 --> 24:28.249
Not on my court's record.

24:29.292 --> 24:33.464
Bail is denied. Remand the defendant
to the Department of Corrections.

24:36.844 --> 24:39.514
Were you surprised at the judge's decision?

24:39.556 --> 24:42.435
Staggered. It's simply beyond me how...

24:42.476 --> 24:44.520
I'm sorry, I can't...

24:44.562 --> 24:48.484
Judge Abrams' decision to remand
was simply wrong-headed.

24:48.526 --> 24:53.323
The assertion that Miss Mulroney
was a risk for flight is ludicrous.

24:53.365 --> 24:57.579
The fact is the Mulroneys have
planned a family reunion in Bermuda.

24:57.620 --> 25:01.209
I expect that Stephanie
will be part of that celebration,

25:01.251 --> 25:04.380
as soon as the judge's decision
is reviewed by his peers.

25:04.422 --> 25:07.926
Judge Abrams is a conservative
Republican. Was that a factor?

25:07.968 --> 25:10.680
You said that. I didn't.
You'll have to ask him.

25:12.432 --> 25:14.810
- Any response to that?
- To what?

25:14.852 --> 25:18.481
That holding Miss Mulroney without bail
is totally ridiculous.

25:18.523 --> 25:21.277
That family is used to getting its way.

25:21.318 --> 25:24.531
Are you saying
they get preferential treatment?

25:24.573 --> 25:25.782
Oh, come on.

25:25.824 --> 25:29.455
They deserve all due process of the law.
No more, no less.

25:30.289 --> 25:32.333
I hope to God we're right on this.

25:32.375 --> 25:35.462
I hear Logan's learning
to love Staten Island.

25:35.504 --> 25:39.426
If you have any knowledge of this handgun,
please call Olivia Benson

25:39.467 --> 25:44.098
at the Special Victims Unit, 212-555-0156.

25:44.140 --> 25:48.146
Not a magnum, no.
It was used in a homicide in New York City.

25:48.187 --> 25:51.066
I know there's no federal gun registry.

25:51.108 --> 25:55.280
But surely we can cross-reference
New York State with your files?

25:56.322 --> 25:58.909
Yes, surprise, surprise. A single bullet.

25:58.951 --> 26:02.622
In the vicinity of the 1-7? When?
Oh, boy. Captain!

26:02.664 --> 26:05.126
- Yeah.
- It's the duty captain at the 1-7.

26:05.168 --> 26:08.005
Another shooting, .44 calibre,
back of the head.

26:08.046 --> 26:10.258
- Parked car?
- Pants down.

26:13.429 --> 26:16.933
Oh, this looks familiar.
Déjà vu all over again.

26:16.975 --> 26:19.520
The guy never knew what hit him. One shot.

26:19.562 --> 26:23.483
- Who's got the spent round?
- I dug it out of the visor.

26:23.525 --> 26:26.404
- Those bits of shattered glass?
- The vanity mirror.

26:26.446 --> 26:30.909
- Vanity, thy name is woman.
- Frailty, not vanity, misogynist.

26:30.951 --> 26:33.997
- Artist formerly known as?
- Prince's old girlfriend.

26:34.039 --> 26:37.084
Life! One minute,
getting your door knob polished,

26:37.126 --> 26:39.796
the next you're sweet-talking Saint Peter.

26:39.838 --> 26:42.467
- You got an ID?
- Car belongs to Stanley Brecker.

26:42.508 --> 26:45.512
- Is that his wife?
- Her name's not Brecker.

26:45.554 --> 26:47.599
Er, Catfish.

26:47.640 --> 26:50.436
Katish, K-A-T-l-S-H.

26:52.688 --> 26:55.358
Excuse me, Miss Katish.
How are you doing?

26:55.400 --> 26:57.445
Not that hot.

26:57.486 --> 27:00.699
I never thought I'd be part
of something like this.

27:00.741 --> 27:03.036
Something like what?

27:04.078 --> 27:07.666
You know... All of this. That.

27:08.709 --> 27:12.673
That guy died while I... You know.

27:12.715 --> 27:16.803
Oh! So, you didn't get a good look at him?
Did you get a peek maybe?

27:16.845 --> 27:19.515
I remember his eyes. Bright and shiny.

27:19.557 --> 27:23.145
- With those Buddy Holly glasses.
- What, black?

27:23.187 --> 27:26.608
Yeah. Like a little psychotic nerd.

27:26.649 --> 27:29.778
That's a good description.
What do you do, Miss Katish?

27:29.820 --> 27:31.865
Erm...

27:31.907 --> 27:35.411
I model. And temp work.

27:35.453 --> 27:39.207
And I auditioned for Picnic this week.

27:40.250 --> 27:44.465
We met in a bar
and he seemed like a nice guy.

27:50.264 --> 27:52.308
Can I get you anything, Mrs Brecker?

27:52.349 --> 27:56.314
Was it a car-jacking gone wrong
or something?

27:58.649 --> 28:01.278
We're not sure.

28:01.320 --> 28:03.156
Shot.

28:03.198 --> 28:06.952
I always thought heart attack
or stroke from the pressure.

28:07.786 --> 28:10.498
- Business pressure?
- The garment business.

28:10.540 --> 28:12.752
It's unbelievably cut-throat.

28:12.793 --> 28:16.048
Stanley loved it but I always worried.

28:16.089 --> 28:19.510
If it wasn't some union organiser
pressuring him,

28:19.552 --> 28:23.807
it was some goon after protection money,
and it never ended.

28:25.894 --> 28:27.980
Well, I guess it has.

28:30.024 --> 28:34.155
Ballistics is still working
to see if the two slugs are twins.

28:34.197 --> 28:38.243
- Follow the bullet. Unbelievable.
- Maybe it's a copycat.

28:38.285 --> 28:41.539
That would be good, unlikely but good.
Weapon?

28:41.581 --> 28:45.127
Uniforms are freezing their asses
in the park having zero luck.

28:45.169 --> 28:47.213
What about the Mulroney chick?

28:47.255 --> 28:49.717
The arrest that's gonna end my career?

28:49.759 --> 28:52.804
It puts a damper on
the 'Hell hath no fury' theory.

28:52.846 --> 28:56.392
Have you got any conspiracy theories
to replace it?

28:58.478 --> 29:01.565
- How's the wife?
- Bitter but not even angry.

29:01.607 --> 29:04.862
- She didn't do it.
- So we're looking for a freak.

29:04.904 --> 29:07.490
Walks up to parked cars
and shoots the guys.

29:07.531 --> 29:09.618
A loser who never gets any himself?

29:14.165 --> 29:16.210
This thing is amazing.

29:16.251 --> 29:20.423
Sometimes I put in the features
of my perfect woman.

29:20.466 --> 29:22.509
Like this?

29:22.551 --> 29:26.264
No, rounder.
And the hair was parted on the left.

29:26.306 --> 29:29.018
It wasn't really parted,
it was brushed back.

29:30.062 --> 29:32.105
Like that?

29:32.147 --> 29:34.400
Yeah, like that.

29:35.485 --> 29:38.280
Captain, I went back 30 years.

29:38.322 --> 29:41.367
319 shootings with a.44
excluding Magnums.

29:41.409 --> 29:43.913
- How many from intermediate range?
- 12.

29:43.954 --> 29:47.459
Some unrelated, a domestic,
a drunken New Year's Eve.

29:47.501 --> 29:50.296
- Plus three from parked cars.
- Any arrests?

29:50.338 --> 29:54.760
Yeah. Two shootings. A guy named Barnes.
Died in the Attica riot.

29:54.801 --> 29:57.972
- What about open cases?
- Four of them, six years ago.

29:58.015 --> 30:02.187
One from the 2-7. In three others,
the slugs were from the same gun.

30:07.318 --> 30:10.364
This is Captain Donald Cragen,
Special Victims Unit.

30:10.405 --> 30:12.950
Is Detective Lennie Briscoe there, please?

30:12.992 --> 30:15.120
Hey, Lennie. Don.

30:15.162 --> 30:19.083
Listen, didn't we have an unsolved 93-94?

30:19.125 --> 30:21.796
Guy whacked in a parked car
with a.44.

30:21.837 --> 30:25.842
There was this annoying
old homeless lady and a lot of snow.

30:25.884 --> 30:29.264
Logan and I froze our asses off, I remember.

30:29.306 --> 30:32.894
- How about the guy in the car?
- Stiff but not from the cold.

30:32.936 --> 30:38.108
We never found the weapon,
just a description of a guy with glasses.

30:38.150 --> 30:40.612
Black, like Buddy Holly?

30:42.740 --> 30:45.160
Yeah, black, like Buddy Holly.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.582
Fashions change, clothes, hair, glasses.

30:49.624 --> 30:53.754
We arrested the wrong guy.
It was just one of those days all around.

30:53.796 --> 30:57.968
The only description we had was
from one witness, Jill Templeton.

30:59.595 --> 31:02.599
- This guy's back?
- With two more hits under his belt.

31:09.483 --> 31:12.278
- Bad time, Captain?
- Oh, no.

31:12.320 --> 31:15.199
I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.452
Yeah. It's a size.44.

31:17.494 --> 31:21.582
- The same gun, the same shooter.
- Not the Mulroney girl.

31:21.624 --> 31:24.878
- No.
- OK, tell me something good.

31:24.920 --> 31:29.051
I spoke to the owner of a gun shop
in Jersey who sold Black Talons.

31:29.093 --> 31:31.846
He remembers a guy with black glasses.

31:34.557 --> 31:36.936
Well, that's something.

31:36.977 --> 31:39.481
Five years ago, a guy came in and browsed.

31:39.523 --> 31:42.944
I never would've have noticed him
but he pissed me off.

31:42.985 --> 31:46.406
Did he denounce the John Birch Society
as being soft on Y2K?

31:46.448 --> 31:49.118
No, he kept dry-firing my hunting rifles.

31:49.160 --> 31:53.708
I told him to buy something
or get his sorry ass out.

31:53.750 --> 31:57.630
- So he bought some Black Talons?
- Said he wanted some cop-killers.

31:57.671 --> 32:01.885
And as a law-abiding
constitutional constructionist,

32:01.927 --> 32:05.598
- you sold them to him.
- It's still a free country.

32:05.640 --> 32:08.393
Could we look at those records?

32:08.435 --> 32:12.190
I'm against government interference
in free enterprise.

32:12.232 --> 32:16.488
Yeah, so am I. That's why I consider
a court order an intrusion,

32:16.530 --> 32:18.783
although sometimes a necessary one.

32:22.037 --> 32:23.747
OK.

32:31.257 --> 32:34.929
'Arthur Prewitt. December 4th, 1994.

32:34.970 --> 32:38.725
'Three boxes of Black Talons, .44 calibre.'

32:39.893 --> 32:44.691
We've got five priors on your man Prewitt,
cheque kiting, forgery...

32:44.733 --> 32:46.860
Was there a weapon involved?

32:46.903 --> 32:49.864
Yes, please. I'm on hold with the Feebs.

32:49.906 --> 32:54.371
He was busted with a hundred credit cards
out at some Indian bingo casino.

32:54.412 --> 32:58.417
The desert will get you every time.
Meth-crazed bikers and scorpions.

32:58.459 --> 33:01.713
- Land of fruit and nuts.
- Released five months ago.

33:01.755 --> 33:06.095
Told his PO his mother was dying.
Address is a flophouse in Chinatown.

33:06.136 --> 33:10.266
I'll call the 2-7.
It's their bust, too. Get rolling.

33:11.518 --> 33:15.273
We're looking for one of your guests.
A man named Prewitt.

33:22.950 --> 33:24.953
Are you Arthur Prewitt?

33:26.788 --> 33:30.710
- Who are you?
- Detective Benson.

33:30.752 --> 33:32.921
You got some ID?

33:34.382 --> 33:36.467
Yes, I do.

33:52.739 --> 33:55.117
I'm the man you're looking for.

34:21.985 --> 34:24.447
- Number three.
- Are you sure?

34:24.489 --> 34:27.618
Yeah. It was dark, but it wasn't that dark.

34:27.659 --> 34:30.330
I'll remember him till the day I die.

34:30.371 --> 34:33.583
- That face, those glasses.
- It's not an audition.

34:33.626 --> 34:35.293
Just... are you sure?

34:36.338 --> 34:38.799
All right. How's this?

34:38.840 --> 34:42.094
And the winner is... number three!

34:42.136 --> 34:45.349
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

34:46.393 --> 34:48.270
Next.

34:50.606 --> 34:54.735
I know it's been a little while,
Miss Templeton, so take a look...

34:54.777 --> 34:57.949
- Number three.
- Are you sure? Just take your time.

34:58.992 --> 35:01.955
- Number three.
- OK, thank you.

35:04.040 --> 35:05.709
All right.

35:12.301 --> 35:14.388
Number three.

35:20.729 --> 35:23.733
- It's Prewitt.
- 'Hey, man.

35:23.775 --> 35:26.862
'I wasn't even there.
I was a patrolman then.

35:26.904 --> 35:29.365
'I still hadn't seen my first stiff.

35:29.407 --> 35:32.662
But when I saw
those crime scene photos.

35:32.704 --> 35:35.999
I almost blew my lunch.

35:38.585 --> 35:40.964
Tuna salad on wheat

35:41.005 --> 35:44.510
and one of those three-dollar bottles
of crappuccino.

35:44.552 --> 35:49.892
Me and my partner at the time,
we were cold for days, weeks,

35:49.934 --> 35:52.604
down by the sea wall.

35:52.646 --> 35:56.943
The wind coming in off the Atlantic
and the wet snow.

35:57.736 --> 36:01.199
It got in your hair, along with that smell.

36:03.702 --> 36:06.205
You know that smell I'm talking about?

36:07.582 --> 36:10.628
Wet wool. I know.

36:11.754 --> 36:13.966
The smell of death, Arthur.

36:15.008 --> 36:17.345
It never leaves you. Never.

36:19.013 --> 36:21.559
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

36:21.600 --> 36:25.313
All these guys trying to get you
to give us a crumb of information.

36:25.355 --> 36:28.109
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it's the high point of my life.

36:28.150 --> 36:32.198
Better than shooting those people,
you little reptilian geek?

36:33.741 --> 36:37.288
- Oh, it's bad cop now, right?
- You bet your ass!

36:37.329 --> 36:38.415
John, easy.

36:38.456 --> 36:42.253
- You did it, you piece of crap.
- Seriously, come on.

36:42.294 --> 36:45.924
- I'm gonna kill this guy myself!
- Call him off.

36:45.966 --> 36:50.388
- I'll Mike Tyson you, you bastard!
- Come on. Is this legal?

36:50.430 --> 36:52.349
Probably not.

36:52.391 --> 36:57.189
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you.

36:57.231 --> 36:59.316
Let's talk about the working stiff.

37:00.986 --> 37:03.071
- Who?
- Dean Woodruff.

37:06.075 --> 37:08.912
- You already asked me about him.
- I'm asking again.

37:08.954 --> 37:13.043
The path in the park.
You're hiding in the tunnel. They drive by...

37:13.085 --> 37:15.546
You've got a vivid imagination.

37:15.587 --> 37:19.468
- Is that all you've got?
- And the Black Talons you bought.

37:19.510 --> 37:23.223
Like I'm the only person in New York
who bought Black Talons?

37:23.265 --> 37:25.351
Three witnesses.

37:26.436 --> 37:28.772
Who saw what?

37:28.814 --> 37:31.108
It was pitch-black.

37:32.152 --> 37:36.991
The windows were fogging up because
the people inside were getting busy.

37:37.032 --> 37:38.451
So, you were there?

37:41.080 --> 37:42.373
No.

37:44.918 --> 37:47.004
I've just got a vivid imagination.

37:50.759 --> 37:52.845
Three different witnesses, Prewitt.

37:53.888 --> 37:55.015
Uh-uh.

37:56.266 --> 37:59.186
Confess. Maybe you won't end up...

38:00.230 --> 38:02.649
you know where.

38:04.944 --> 38:07.573
We saw your handiwork. It was...

38:07.614 --> 38:11.077
- It was awesome. It was...
- Professional. One shot, boom.

38:12.580 --> 38:15.040
And then you leave the girl alone.

38:17.752 --> 38:19.839
You left the girl alone.

38:20.923 --> 38:22.384
That was...

38:24.721 --> 38:26.681
Gentlemanly.

38:26.723 --> 38:30.979
The very word I was looking for.
You are a gentleman of the old school.

38:39.823 --> 38:41.826
So that's a yes.

38:49.670 --> 38:51.547
Under coercion...

38:53.675 --> 38:55.552
that's a yes.

39:03.187 --> 39:05.064
Well, that's that.

39:06.150 --> 39:08.695
- Prewitt confessed.
- To killing Woodruff?

39:08.737 --> 39:12.867
That's the good news. The bad news
is Schiffs gonna ream me a new one.

39:12.908 --> 39:15.245
- Maybe not.
- Meaning?

39:15.287 --> 39:19.667
This guy stonewalls us,
then flips like an eel. What's his agenda?

39:19.709 --> 39:21.879
I'm damned if I know, John.

39:26.509 --> 39:29.680
This shooting's remarkably
similar to the first.

39:29.722 --> 39:33.728
COD from a.44. Same point of entry.
Same trajectory.

39:33.769 --> 39:36.439
And given the lack of any powder tattoos,

39:36.480 --> 39:39.151
I'd say the shooter
was at least a few feet away.

39:39.192 --> 39:41.654
But there is one significant difference.

39:41.696 --> 39:44.074
Tell me what you see.

39:44.116 --> 39:48.037
A beautiful woman who hasn't been
in a nice restaurant in months.

39:48.079 --> 39:50.249
Ruptured blood vessels.

39:51.292 --> 39:53.336
Mild skin discoloration.

39:53.378 --> 39:55.548
These bruises are a few weeks old.

39:55.590 --> 39:57.633
There's similar bruising on the jaw.

39:57.675 --> 40:02.223
- So he had previous injuries.
- My guess is from a fist fight.

40:02.265 --> 40:05.769
Are you talking polite fisticuffs
or brass knuckles?

40:05.811 --> 40:07.856
Somebody beat the crap out of him.

40:07.897 --> 40:09.983
Will you ever have dinner with me?

40:11.027 --> 40:13.112
Not while I can still feed myself.

40:15.657 --> 40:19.495
I'm only sorry we had to involve
everyone in this wild-goose chase.

40:19.537 --> 40:22.166
I'm not sure it was so wild.

40:23.208 --> 40:25.670
Is the investigation still open?

40:25.712 --> 40:28.048
No, sir, not any more.

40:28.090 --> 40:30.802
The public has deified the Mulroneys.

40:30.844 --> 40:33.306
They've done a lot to deserve that.

40:33.347 --> 40:36.018
That entitlement doesn't extend to the law.

40:36.059 --> 40:37.936
Well, it does.

40:39.397 --> 40:42.108
And someone is going
to have to fall on his sword.

40:44.695 --> 40:47.490
It'll be painless.

40:47.532 --> 40:49.577
Yes, come in.

40:49.618 --> 40:52.831
- Good afternoon, Adam.
- Welcome.

40:53.874 --> 40:57.086
We all know each other.
Please, sit down.

40:57.128 --> 41:02.886
I asked Judge McEvoy
to dismiss in chambers, without prejudice,

41:02.927 --> 41:06.182
to spare any further public embarrassment.

41:06.223 --> 41:08.310
I appreciate the gesture, Adam.

41:08.351 --> 41:11.981
God knows, we'll always
be grist to the tabloids.

41:12.023 --> 41:15.736
People are always quick
to jump to the wrong conclusion.

41:15.777 --> 41:18.406
From some youthful indiscretion,

41:18.448 --> 41:20.701
to this trumped-up mess.

41:20.743 --> 41:24.748
- Have you heard from Judge Abrams?
- He heard from me.

41:24.789 --> 41:26.876
I guess that's my cue.

41:28.544 --> 41:31.798
- I was wrong, Miss Mulroney.
- All right.

41:32.884 --> 41:36.263
Please accept my apologies to your family.

41:36.305 --> 41:39.017
Thank you, Captain.
You seem like a nice man.

41:48.696 --> 41:51.158
Captain, I just came from the ME's.

41:51.200 --> 41:53.201
She has some doubts about Brecker.

41:53.243 --> 41:55.914
What is this, another magic bullet theory?

41:55.955 --> 41:58.500
Somebody worked him over pretty good.

41:58.542 --> 42:01.713
- A soft guy, not an amateur boxer.
- I'm not following you.

42:01.755 --> 42:04.425
He was in the garment trade,
like my grandfather.

42:04.467 --> 42:08.013
He always said, 'Behind every
tailor's dummy is a Gambino.'

42:08.055 --> 42:09.932
Where are you going with this?

42:09.974 --> 42:13.687
The victim was in the garment trade.
His wife said he was a family man.

42:13.729 --> 42:17.317
But he was shot in mid oral cop
with some actress, model, whatever,

42:17.358 --> 42:20.738
a euphemism for employee of the month
in the porno business.

42:20.779 --> 42:22.908
- John!
- The wife also told Benson

42:22.949 --> 42:25.494
that her husband got shaken down

42:25.536 --> 42:28.414
by two bull-necked boys in leather jackets.

42:28.456 --> 42:32.837
Schmutters and porno, Captain.
Does the word racketeering come to mind?

42:33.921 --> 42:38.845
- So this isn't a serial killer?
- It's all too neat. All too simple.

42:38.887 --> 42:43.642
Stephanie Mulroney killed Woodruff.
I know it. I feel it.

42:45.353 --> 42:48.858
I'm not gonna tell anyone
we've had this conversation.

42:48.900 --> 42:52.821
The Mulroneys can crush
any of us like bugs.

42:52.822 --> 42:53.822
They'll do whatever it takes
to protect the family. Trust me!
