are with mellie.

Because we have
the best candidate

Do you think you'll be able
to secure

Governor baker's endorsement
over vice president ross?

it's hard to watch

08:25.672 --> 08:27.272
Until 10:15 tonight.
-10:15?!

08:27.274 --> 08:29.040
Can't we just get the governor
to hold off making a decision?

08:29.042 --> 08:30.442
Have a breakfast meeting
with her.

08:30.444 --> 08:31.776
She's already said publicly

08:31.778 --> 08:32.777
That she's making
her decision tonight.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.813
She won't push.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.348
Susan's gonna be
all over baker,

08:36.350 --> 08:37.983
Charming her
with some hokey story

08:37.985 --> 08:39.784
About how she used to go
[southern accent] gator hunting

08:39.786 --> 08:41.119
In the everglades with
her paw paw every christmas.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.054
Mellie.

08:44.624 --> 08:45.657
How did you do that?

08:45.659 --> 08:47.292
Seriously,
what's the play?

08:47.294 --> 08:49.294
It's not like we can shove
air force one off the runway.

08:52.732 --> 08:56.801
No,
but we can shame them off.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.503
Rumors are swirling
at this hour,

08:58.505 --> 09:00.505
As mellie grant's plane
remains grounded

09:00.507 --> 09:02.574
Behind the out-of-commission
air force one.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.643
A source close to senator grant

09:04.645 --> 09:06.244
Speaking on condition
of anonymity

09:06.246 --> 09:08.380
Claims the mechanical
issues plaguing air force one

09:08.382 --> 09:09.915
Are bogus --

09:09.917 --> 09:11.249
<i>An invention designed</i>

09:11.251 --> 09:12.517
<i>To keep the senator</i>
<i>away from florida...</i>

09:12.519 --> 09:14.319
What the hell is going on?

09:14.321 --> 09:17.255
We are actually having
mechanical difficulties, right?

09:17.257 --> 09:19.925
That's why I've been sitting on
a tarmac for an hour and a half?

09:19.927 --> 09:22.827
Abby.
Say something.

09:22.829 --> 09:24.729
Mechanical difficulties
are real.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.065
Can you prove that?
We can't publish
technical documents

09:27.067 --> 09:28.733
Without compromising
the president's safety.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.669
Abby.
This is unethical.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.571
This isn't just unethical.
It's criminal.

09:32.573 --> 09:35.006
It's a criminal act.
You can't just lie to the faa.

09:35.008 --> 09:37.542
We take off now, we're all but
admitting that we broke the law.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.377
There would be an investigation,
hearings,

09:39.379 --> 09:40.679
Susan would take a huge hit.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.747
You may not like what I've done,
but it's done.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.549
Now please,
go back into your office

09:44.551 --> 09:46.151
And do your job
and let me do mine.

09:49.188 --> 09:50.722
Hey, hey, hey.
You want to write a story?

09:50.724 --> 09:51.890
Write one about
a desperate campaign

09:51.892 --> 09:52.891
Spreading lies
about their opponents,

09:52.893 --> 09:54.426
Because that's what this is.

09:54.428 --> 09:57.529
Janice quinby, who can't go home
to be with her ailing father.

09:57.531 --> 10:00.131
Tom dessantis, who's missing
the birth of his first grandson.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.033
Stacey brewster,
who's going to haiti

10:02.035 --> 10:03.935
To build schools
and just missed her connection.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.937
But here's the thing.
It's not going to work.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.606
The people of florida
are going to see this

10:07.608 --> 10:09.307
For what it is,
and they'll take their anger

10:09.309 --> 10:11.943
Into the voting booth on Tuesday
when they vote for susan ross.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.712
These are just a few
of the thousands of passengers

10:13.714 --> 10:15.046
Stranded on the burbank terminal

10:15.048 --> 10:17.082
Because their flights
have been postponed or cancelled

10:17.084 --> 10:18.550
Due to the white house's
dirty tricks.

10:18.552 --> 10:19.985
If anyone should
take their anger

10:19.987 --> 10:21.319
Into the voting booth,
it's them.

10:22.588 --> 10:24.456
[ knock on door ]

10:28.327 --> 10:29.461
Governor.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.829
May I come in?

10:30.831 --> 10:32.631
Sure.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.566
You just missed susan.
I can call her if you like.

10:34.568 --> 10:36.635
Oh, no, no.
That's all right.

10:36.637 --> 10:37.802
I'm not here
to talk to her.

10:39.171 --> 10:41.473
Can I level with you?

10:41.475 --> 10:43.975
Uh, sure.
Level away.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.076
I like susan.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.411
I think she's smart.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.013
I think she's personable,

10:48.015 --> 10:50.248
But I don't really think
she's cut out to be president.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.583
Too idealistic.

10:51.585 --> 10:53.618
There's nothing wrong
with optimism.

10:53.620 --> 10:56.354
Now mellie grant, on the other
hand, she's a back-room brawler.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.457
She'll get things done
no matter what the cost.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.526
[ chuckles ]
she's like me.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.662
So if I had to endorse somebody
right now,

11:03.664 --> 11:05.130
It would have to be
senator grant.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.464
I'm confused.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.266
You want me to pass that message
on to susan?

11:08.268 --> 11:10.869
'cause I really don't want to
give her that kind of news.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.204

you're familiar with them?

11:13.206 --> 11:14.439
They're currently
under investigation

11:14.441 --> 11:16.408
By my office, so, yes.

11:18.277 --> 11:20.512
I'd like you
to drop your investigation.

11:21.781 --> 11:23.281
And why would I do that?

11:23.283 --> 11:25.684
Because there's still time
before the primary,

11:25.686 --> 11:29.287
Which means there's still time
for me to change my mind

11:29.289 --> 11:31.489
And endorse someone
other than senator grant.

11:31.491 --> 11:34.159
Say, susan, for instance.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.627
Do you realize what
you're suggesting, governor?

11:35.629 --> 11:37.228
Because maybe you don't.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.531
Maybe we want to
call this a mistake?

11:40.833 --> 11:42.333

11:42.335 --> 11:44.602
Maybe we don't.

39:13.051 --> 39:14.517
Guess it wasn't enough.

39:14.519 --> 39:17.554
I'll go write
my press statement.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.292
Hopefully
the other campaigns learned

39:22.294 --> 39:26.396
A little something today --
ignore hollis at your peril,

39:26.398 --> 39:28.565
Or else prepare to watch
from the sidelines

39:28.567 --> 39:30.633
As president doyle
laughs his way

39:30.635 --> 39:32.802
All the way
to the white house.

39:32.804 --> 39:35.705
Now, I'm not saying
I don't enjoy a good cat fight

39:35.707 --> 39:37.707
Every now and then,

39:37.709 --> 39:41.077
But if you gals don't
stop hissing at each other,

39:41.079 --> 39:44.981
I may just end up
running away with this thing.

39:44.983 --> 39:47.083
A-and what's the fun in winning

39:47.085 --> 39:48.852
If there ain't
a little competition?

40:01.899 --> 40:03.867
What I don't get
is why you were so mad at me.

40:03.869 --> 40:06.069
Are you -- abby.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.537
What you did --

40:07.539 --> 40:09.038
I don't mean now.
I know why now.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.540
I mean before.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.509
When I got the job in the oval,
when I got some power,

40:12.511 --> 40:14.377
When I sat in your apartment
after andrew showed up

40:14.379 --> 40:15.945
And I was afraid
of losing everything,

40:15.947 --> 40:17.781
And I was looking
for my friend to --

40:17.783 --> 40:21.584
To support and comfort me,
and you seemed...

40:21.586 --> 40:22.852
Thrilled.

40:24.922 --> 40:25.889
I didn't seem --

40:25.891 --> 40:27.557
"you're not a monster,
little abby.

40:27.559 --> 40:29.125
You could come
and work for me...

40:29.127 --> 40:31.694
Little abby."

[ scoffs ]

40:38.869 --> 40:40.937
I'm happy for you, abby.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.405
I am.

40:42.407 --> 40:45.074
But I taught you.

40:45.076 --> 40:46.976
I raised you.

40:46.978 --> 40:50.380
I made that oval.
I built that president.

40:50.382 --> 40:53.149
I had to walk away from
the white house because of him.

40:53.151 --> 40:55.118
I want it back.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.120
I want
my white house back.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.755
I earned it!

40:58.757 --> 41:01.958
I'm rooting for you,
but not if it means I lose.

41:01.960 --> 41:05.628
I'm done losing.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.297
Hey,
it's not a total loss.

41:07.299 --> 41:08.898
What do you mean?

41:08.900 --> 41:10.099
Well, she doesn't
hate you anymore

41:10.101 --> 41:11.701
And you kept
your conscience clean.

41:13.838 --> 41:17.373
You did keep your conscience
clean, right, david?

41:19.610 --> 41:20.977
Oh, my god.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.612
You made a deal
with the governor.

41:22.614 --> 41:23.780
That's why
she endorsed susan.

41:23.782 --> 41:25.949
You cannot tell her.

41:25.951 --> 41:27.784
While everyone
was watching a couple

41:27.786 --> 41:29.586
Of professional alley cats
go at it,

41:29.588 --> 41:32.989
A big dog snuck in the back door
and stole all the goodies.

Michael,
you son of a bitch.

Where's my child?

41:58.383 --> 42:00.550
You cannot take my damn child!

42:01.619 --> 42:03.353
We both lost today.

42:03.355 --> 42:05.188
We did.

42:05.190 --> 42:06.756
I don't like losing.

42:08.125 --> 42:09.459
So what now?

42:09.461 --> 42:11.127
Sally: Don't get
too comfortable, hollis.

42:11.129 --> 42:13.363
A dog at a cat fight
can suddenly find

42:13.365 --> 42:15.732
He's become dinner
at a lion's den.

42:15.734 --> 42:17.500
We need to do what we should've
done a long time ago.

Hollis doyle.
Hollis doyle.
