WEBVTT

00:11.344 --> 00:15.473
All right, you guys, ten more days
until the academic decathlon.

00:15.765 --> 00:17.267
Two things I'm not cut out for:

00:17.642 --> 00:19.894
academics and decathlons.

00:20.895 --> 00:22.480
Ah, come on, Walt.
That's what you guys said

00:22.564 --> 00:25.108
about the talent show,
and look how great that turned out.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.776
We lost to the janitor.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.529
Yeah, but he was really good.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.782
He plunged his way right into our hearts.

00:33.324 --> 00:37.037
[chuckles] A-And he flushed our chances
down the toilet.

00:37.579 --> 00:38.663
[students laugh]

00:38.747 --> 00:42.500
But don't worry, no way we'll lose
to the custodial staff in the decathlon.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.210
Grace is right.

00:44.669 --> 00:46.796
No,
we're gonna lose to the honor students.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.757
Come on, Mikey,
be a little more optimistic.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.508
This is you as a cheerleader:

00:50.592 --> 00:53.595
[in high-pitched voice]
"Who're we gonna beat? Nobody!

00:54.763 --> 00:57.474
What're we gonna do? Lose!"

00:59.309 --> 01:01.644
The honor students have
all the advantages.

01:01.936 --> 01:04.397
-[in normal voice] Come on, like what?
-All the honor students.

01:05.023 --> 01:06.858
Well, not all of them.

01:06.941 --> 01:08.026
Stop it.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.863
But, they do get
all the school-issued iPads.

01:12.113 --> 01:12.947
That is true.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.908
When we learn
about the American Revolution,

01:14.991 --> 01:18.078
we will learn about it
the same way they did in 1776:

01:18.411 --> 01:20.080
-from books!
-[desk rattles]

01:20.997 --> 01:23.833
Mr. I, look, they also get extra help
from expensive tutors.

01:23.917 --> 01:28.213
That is true. Hey, but do they have
these awesome, minty green note cards

01:28.296 --> 01:30.548
purchased with a teacher's salary
from Costco?

01:32.884 --> 01:35.011
Along with a couple of Chicken Bakes?

01:36.179 --> 01:38.932
See? We're analog, they're digital.

01:39.015 --> 01:41.851
They get Intel chips implanted
in their brain.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.230
Not true, Lorenzo, but even if it was,

01:45.313 --> 01:47.816
you have plenty of intel already implanted
in your brains, too.

01:48.024 --> 01:51.194
Huh? What? When? No, I knew it!

01:53.488 --> 01:54.531
Dude, calm down.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.991
-We talked about this. Hey, bring it in.
-Okay.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.451
[both speaking softly]

01:58.535 --> 02:02.789
Lorenzo, Mr. Iglesias is just saying
he's taught us a lot this semester.

02:02.872 --> 02:04.457
Exactly. Watch.

02:05.041 --> 02:08.294
Mikey, what building was under attack
during "The Star-Spangled Banner"?

02:08.503 --> 02:12.048
Uh... Okay, okay. Uh, Fortnite, midnight,

02:12.132 --> 02:14.259
snacked on McRib... Fort McHenry!

02:17.554 --> 02:18.721
What just happened?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.391
Mikey used a mnemonic device

02:21.474 --> 02:23.601
Mr. Iglesias gave him
to remember an answer.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.312
Uh-huh, uh-huh!
So he is using devices!

02:26.437 --> 02:29.065
-[panting]
-[breathing steadily]

02:29.816 --> 02:32.944
Lorenzo, uh, are you allowed to take
your emotional support Walt on airplanes?

02:34.654 --> 02:35.905
Okay, here's another one. Um...

02:35.989 --> 02:38.741
Mikey, finish this Ronald Reagan quote:

02:38.950 --> 02:41.744
-[imitating Reagan] "Mr. Gorbachev--"
-[shouts] "Tear down this wall!"

02:43.121 --> 02:44.789
Man, it feels good to say that. [chuckles]

02:46.040 --> 02:49.711
Imagine that, a Republican president
who thought walls were a bad idea.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.882
Not just history, ancient history.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.302
[in normal voice]
See? You guys don't need iPads.

02:57.385 --> 03:00.013
How many times do I have to tell you?
You guys are smart.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.224
If you keep having to tell us,
it's probably not true.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.311
Really? Okay, what about this?

03:06.394 --> 03:07.270
Uh...

03:07.353 --> 03:09.230
-What president defeated the Nazis?
-[Grace] Oh!

03:09.314 --> 03:11.941
I love how you taught us
to remember this one.

03:12.358 --> 03:15.111
F-dem-racists.

03:15.195 --> 03:18.072

[Rakeem grunts]

03:23.411 --> 03:24.454
That's right!

03:25.038 --> 03:27.540
And the best part about history is
it repeats itself.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.417
Kinda like me with fourth grade.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.920
Lot easier the second time, huh?

03:33.588 --> 03:35.381
Listen, with or without iPads,

03:35.465 --> 03:38.051
those honor students are gonna be
in big trouble, okay?

03:38.134 --> 03:42.055
I've been working to close the gap
between the haves and the have-nots.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.890
Have you had any luck?

03:45.642 --> 03:46.643
I have not.

Good morning, Mr. Hayward.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.122
Doubt it.

Ah, I should've known better
than to open up with something

04:11.709 --> 04:13.378
as controversial as "good morning."

[Ray] As you know, our contract is up.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.593
And as your union rep,
I regret to inform you

04:20.677 --> 04:23.638
that the district is pushing for rollbacks
across the board.

I mean, me without coffee, that's like--
Uh... See? I need coffee.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.737
So, can I count on both of your votes
to authorize a teachers' strike?

04:40.321 --> 04:41.489
Not without my coffee.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.118
I wouldn't mind a little paid vacation.

04:45.201 --> 04:46.369
Count me in as pro-strike.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.205
You know you don't get paid
when on strike, right?

04:49.455 --> 04:52.250
Oh, I'm pro-pay raise, but anti-strike.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.378
Hey, can't we just get a pay raise
without a strike?

04:55.712 --> 04:58.006
Maybe we should just ask nicely, huh?

04:59.257 --> 05:01.342
Why didn't I think of that? Jackass.

Good morning, everyone!

Be careful, you can't just barge in here

Ms. Spencer, will you be voting yes
for a strike authorization?

Oh, I don't know, Mr. Hayward.
I believe in our union's cause, I do,

05:18.568 --> 05:21.070
but we have the best job in the world.

05:21.237 --> 05:24.198
Abby, we're high school teachers,
not Rihanna's weed dealer.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.745
Well, if it means I have to sell
some plasma every month

05:28.828 --> 05:32.123

that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

That explains why the first-aid kit

Cocoa butter.

Offensive, but yes.

I knew it!

Abby, Mr. Hayward's actually 35.

06:22.006 --> 06:24.175
That's-- That's how hard teaching is.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.471
Which is why I need you guys to vote yes
on the authorization.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.973
But my kids are so close to the decathlon.

If we strike now, I won't be there
when they need me the most.

I'm just asking for everyone
to authorize a strike.

you don't have to swing it.

but on behalf of my students,
I have to say no.

Quiet, management approaches.

07:06.342 --> 07:09.762
What's this, Ray?
Do I smell a hollow strike threat?

07:10.179 --> 07:12.598
With subtle notes
of "not getting a raise"?

07:13.141 --> 07:15.977
Has anyone ever told you
you're the orange Starburst of people?

07:20.022 --> 07:21.899
I don't like strikes, they're messy.

07:22.191 --> 07:24.444
Like a threesome after a crawfish boil.

07:27.238 --> 07:30.283
And you know who gets stuck
cleaning up the mess? Me.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.995
At the school or at the crawfish boil?

07:34.078 --> 07:34.954
Both.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.833
Don't worry, Paula, they're not striking.
They're wusses.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.919
Wusses? You have two different tuxedos
for your dog.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.298
Yeah. And guess
who never gets caught off-guard

07:45.381 --> 07:47.008
when one of them is at the dry cleaners?

07:48.426 --> 07:51.304
All I know is when I say
I'm going to walk, I do it.

07:51.387 --> 07:52.930
Ask my three ex-husbands.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.893
I would, but no one's seen Bone, Thugs,
or Harmony for years.

07:59.187 --> 08:02.732
Paula, look, no one wants a strike.
No one wants to hurt the kids either.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.984
Gabe, I hope you get everything
you're asking for,

08:05.234 --> 08:08.112
but if you don't wanna hurt the kids,
then don't strike.

08:08.196 --> 08:11.866
[gasps] Great! No strike.
Close call! That was exciting.

08:13.117 --> 08:14.368
Hey, you want exciting?

Paula, teachers are hurting.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.088
Oh, cry me a river.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.299
Look, I remember when I was a teacher.

08:28.382 --> 08:30.801
It was easy. Summers off,

08:30.885 --> 08:34.680
good healthcare, and an apple a day,
so we didn't even need healthcare.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.809
Gabe, you guys work less
than any other profession,

08:38.893 --> 08:41.395
but somehow complain twice as much.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.190
Carlos, you know what would happen
if teachers didn't do their jobs?

08:44.690 --> 08:45.525
What?

08:45.608 --> 08:48.110
We'd end up with adults so dumb
they think teachers are lazy.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.655
Precisely. Uh... Wait, what?

08:54.992 --> 08:56.160
Mr. Hayward,

08:56.244 --> 08:59.413
you promise this strike authorization
is just a negotiation tool?

08:59.497 --> 09:01.582
-I promise.
-Then count me in.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.835
If it's the best way to avoid a strike,
I'm in.

09:05.336 --> 09:08.172
Yeah, if it's the best way
to get on Abby's team, I'm in.

09:10.132 --> 09:12.051
Yes, that's it. We're over the top.

09:12.635 --> 09:15.012
Raising the cudgel of a unified front.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.556
Yeah, without swinging it.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.809
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I gotta go hit Starbucks

09:19.892 --> 09:21.727
before I flip over a school bus.

09:22.979 --> 09:23.854

-Wait, where the hell is the coffee maker?
-Oh.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.903
I... might have hidden it to make a point.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.039
And I'm really impressed at how many
of you are showing up

09:42.123 --> 09:44.917
for these after-school jam sessions
for the academic decathlon.

09:45.209 --> 09:48.421
It was this or violin.
[chuckles] It wasn't close.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.172

09:50.506 --> 09:52.341
Yeah, now that football's over,

09:52.425 --> 09:54.468
I need something to scratch
that competitive itch.

09:54.802 --> 09:56.387
You know they sell stuff for that, right?

09:59.140 --> 10:02.143
Mr. Iglesias,
we heard you were going on strike.

10:02.518 --> 10:03.894
Ah, no, no, no.

10:03.978 --> 10:06.022
You also heard that, uh,
Principal Madison was

10:06.105 --> 10:06.939
on American Idol,

10:07.023 --> 10:10.109
but in reality,
she just waited in line and got sent home.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.864
Nobody is going on strike.

10:15.156 --> 10:18.826
Yeah, because you wouldn't walk out on us
right before the academic decathlon.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.828
Look, the only reason I would go on strike

10:20.911 --> 10:23.080
is if In-N-Out stopped selling
Animal Fries.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.541
So you voted no?

10:25.750 --> 10:27.126
Uh, oh, no, I voted yes.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.210
What?

10:28.294 --> 10:30.588
Look,
Mr. Hayward promised it's the best way

10:30.671 --> 10:32.923
-to avoid going on strike.
-And you bought it?

10:33.007 --> 10:35.384
This is like when we let Facebook
collect our personal data

10:35.468 --> 10:37.720
and trusted they wouldn't sell it
to the highest bidder.

10:40.723 --> 10:41.641
[coughs] Russia!

10:46.771 --> 10:49.565
Relax, you guys.
No one is going on strike.

10:49.857 --> 10:51.442
Just got off the phone with the union.

10:51.525 --> 10:52.735
We're on strike.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.487
Pack your things, Gabriel.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.742
Sounds like the opposite
of what he just promised.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.786
Look, don't pay attention to Mr. Hayward.

11:01.869 --> 11:06.082
He's one clipped mailbox away from being
on the DMV's "too old to drive" list.

11:08.834 --> 11:12.588
Huh. Turns out he would abandon us
right before the academic decathlon.

11:13.255 --> 11:16.133
Now would be a good time to say
something inspiring, Mr. Iglesias.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.219
At least, funny.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.348
[sighs]

11:22.640 --> 11:23.766
I'm really sorry, guys.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.726
Not funny or inspiring.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.272
Damn, since you went on strike,
you totally lost it.

11:35.986 --> 11:37.571
Thank you, Ruthie.

11:37.655 --> 11:41.283
You'll be a great sub
for Mrs. Lopez's Spanish class.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.452
I'm sure it'll come back to you.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.746
And if all else fails,

11:45.830 --> 11:48.499
play them an episode of Narcos.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.961
I'm sure those gentleman speak
proper Spanish.

11:52.670 --> 11:53.838
Arrivederci.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.423
Yeah, close enough.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.885
Okay, adiós.

12:09.854 --> 12:10.688
Okay, Carlos,

12:10.771 --> 12:13.149
this administration
has to cover these classrooms.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.358
What can you teach?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.819
Oh, I can teach theater. [chuckles]

12:18.237 --> 12:19.697
I'm quite the dramaturge.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.658
Theater was cut four years ago.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.869
[groans] "The unkindest cut."

12:26.579 --> 12:29.623
Fine, give me Mr. Iglesias' class.
They can use a little discipline.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.419
Okay, it'll be good for them to experience
a different teaching style,

12:33.586 --> 12:35.254
someone who's not trying
to be their friend.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.506
Exactly, [softly] I don't need friends.

12:39.216 --> 12:40.134
Good thing.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.471
What about you, Paula?
Which classes will you be taking over?

12:43.554 --> 12:47.308
Oh, I'll be teaching a little class
called "Mama don't do demotions."

12:48.809 --> 12:51.979
Paula, before I hit the picket line,
I gotta talk to you about my students.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.481
God!

12:54.273 --> 12:56.275
When is it not about your students?

12:57.026 --> 12:58.068
This is exhausting.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.571
"Wah!
My students are getting counseled out.

13:00.654 --> 13:02.656
Ooh, I got them into the talent show."

13:02.740 --> 13:05.493
Yay, my students are competing
in the decathlon!"

13:11.999 --> 13:14.376
That pretty much sums up my semester.
[sighs]

13:15.044 --> 13:18.297
Well, if you look at it that way,
your kids have had a remarkable journey.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.258
Too bad you blew it by going on strike.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.636
Come on, Paula, my kids are so close.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.346
You were an excellent teacher.

13:25.429 --> 13:28.182
You could take over my class
and pull them across the finish line.

13:28.265 --> 13:31.393
I probably could,
but Carlos will be teaching your class.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.478
Carlos?

13:32.853 --> 13:35.731
Seriously, Carlos?
Carlos has two limitations as a teacher:

13:36.023 --> 13:38.818
one, he doesn't know anything,
and two, he can't teach.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.571
Strikes have consequences, Gabe,

13:42.655 --> 13:47.034
and your consequence is your kids
are being babysat by Mr. Doubtfire.

13:52.623 --> 13:53.499
Come on.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.209
Take over my class.

13:55.292 --> 13:58.170
I heard you saved so many at-risk kids,
they almost made a movie about you.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.130
My answer is no.

14:00.631 --> 14:03.551
-[sighs]
-Michelle Pfeiffer, my black ass.

14:09.765 --> 14:13.477
How long do these strikes usually last?
I got money on it lasting under a month.

14:14.061 --> 14:15.187
You bet on the strike?

14:15.563 --> 14:18.274
No, I mean, I don't have enough money
for it to last more than a month.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.069
That's what strike funds are for, Tony.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.821
Great, fork it over.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.574
Okay. How many children do you have?

14:26.824 --> 14:28.742
-None.
-Wifey?

14:29.410 --> 14:30.327
Single.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.206
Ailing parents you're taking care of?

14:34.290 --> 14:35.416
No, my sister does that.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.836
[chuckles]
Then start bagging groceries, Tony,

14:38.919 --> 14:41.422
because the strike fund isn't
for people like you.

14:41.797 --> 14:45.801
Katie, thank you so much for letting us
use this place as strike headquarters.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.469
I wish I was in a union.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.389
My dad makes us punch out
before we do our side work.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.850
Sounds like somebody
ought to punch him out.

14:53.809 --> 14:56.937
Well, Ray has a bat if you need
to negotiate with your father.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.899
-Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

15:00.482 --> 15:01.859
Aluminum or wood?

15:02.109 --> 15:04.820
Well, I'm old-school,
but I went aluminum in the '80s.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.866
See, more bat speed sends
a clearer message to the scabs.

15:10.993 --> 15:11.827
[Gabe] Whoo!

15:11.911 --> 15:14.705
-What's up, fellow strikers?
-[Abby] Oh, hey, Gabe.

15:14.788 --> 15:16.749
Were you able to convince Paula
to teach your kids?

15:16.832 --> 15:20.461
Nope, she went with the guy who killed
our two-ply toilet paper idea.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.338
[sighs]

15:22.630 --> 15:26.342
Carlos, huh? Every day we're on strike,
your kids will be getting dumber.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.845
Yeah, I know. It'll be
like those Thai soccer players stuck

15:29.929 --> 15:31.931
in that cave. Only instead of the water,

15:32.014 --> 15:34.683
it'll be the ignorance level rising
hour by hour.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.604
Well, it shouldn't take more than a month.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.315
A month?
This wasn't even supposed to happen.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.817
This is gonna undo everything
I've worked for all semester.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.611
Well, my honors kids should be fine.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.821
They pretty much teach themselves anyway.

15:49.865 --> 15:52.618
You know, when you think about it,
you've been on strike for years.

15:57.206 --> 16:01.627
Okay, I'm going to read you something
I think you'll find very useful:

16:01.961 --> 16:03.796
your rights. A-boom!

16:05.172 --> 16:07.675
You know what they found
with stop-and-frisk in New York?

16:07.758 --> 16:09.218
Marijuana cigarettes?

16:10.094 --> 16:13.847
No, they found that if you treat people
like criminals, they become criminals.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.225
I'm sure those people were already--

16:16.308 --> 16:17.393
Already what?

16:18.394 --> 16:19.436
Black?

16:20.062 --> 16:24.108
[sighs]
No. That's not what I meant, Rakeem.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.652
He's Lorenzo, I'm Rakeem.

16:27.152 --> 16:30.280
-Yes, okay, my bad. That's on me.
-Yeah. Yeah.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.825
Innocent mistake.
All I'm saying, in a civilized society--

16:32.908 --> 16:37.496
"Civilized" society?
We're criminals, remember? Attica!

16:37.579 --> 16:40.165
[all chanting] Attica! Attica!

16:40.249 --> 16:41.458
Attica!

16:41.542 --> 16:43.711
[shouts] Don't make me take off my shoes!

16:43.794 --> 16:45.045
I swear to gosh--

16:46.088 --> 16:47.172
[sighs]

16:47.881 --> 16:49.925
Carlos, get it together. 

16:50.009 --> 16:51.844
I heard them chanting
all the way down the hall.

16:51.927 --> 16:53.137
They're animals.

16:54.930 --> 16:57.099
Is the nurse on strike?
I need to lie down.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.351
-I think that's a good idea.
-[weakly] Okay.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.313
-I miss Mr. Iglesias.
-I'm on it.

17:03.397 --> 17:06.900
Okay. Students, your sub has a sub.

17:07.234 --> 17:09.194
You can call me Ms. Madison.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.281
Or Miss Mads, if you're nasty.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.413
It's from a little album
in '86 called Control,

17:19.621 --> 17:21.540
if you feel like learning
some real history.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.626
[clears throat] Uh, Ms. 'Net-- Um, uh--

17:24.710 --> 17:26.795
Ms. Madison, um...

17:27.296 --> 17:28.922
Have you ever taught a class before?

17:29.006 --> 17:29.965
Of course.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.884
How do you think someone
becomes a principal?

17:31.967 --> 17:34.762
By taking an online course
at Kaplan University?

17:37.181 --> 17:39.391
Or by giving up on your real dreams?

17:42.394 --> 17:44.354
I think I liked you more
when you didn't talk, Grace.

17:46.857 --> 17:51.737
I use my teaching wand
to transform students.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.530
[scoffing, laughing]

17:53.614 --> 17:54.656
Shut up!

17:56.116 --> 17:57.117
This is real.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.412
Teaching gave me a sense of purpose.

18:00.496 --> 18:01.330
Why'd you stop?

18:02.456 --> 18:04.708
Being a teacher gave me
a sense of purpose.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.711
Being a principal gave me a sense
of home-ownership.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.841
Okay, but, look, while I'm here,
I can teach you a little something.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.469
I don't know.
You got some pretty big calves to fill.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.056
Okay.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.517
Guys, I got this. What?

18:21.975 --> 18:24.353
Mr. Iglesias does voices, right?

18:24.561 --> 18:26.897
I do voices. [clears throat]

18:27.773 --> 18:29.900
[in exaggerated colonial accent]
"Look at me!

18:29.983 --> 18:35.197
I am the first president
of the United States.

18:36.949 --> 18:42.371
I also own slaves,
but they didn't tell you that." [chuckles]

18:43.038 --> 18:45.499
[chuckling, in normal voice] Okay, okay.
So what'd you think?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.878
-Whoo!
-I don't think I'm ever gonna forget

18:49.962 --> 18:50.963
what I just saw.

18:51.547 --> 18:54.508
[in exaggerated Cockney accent]
What? That Washington owned slaves?

18:54.591 --> 18:58.554
You won't. Abracadabra.
[in normal voice] I'm back.

18:59.888 --> 19:01.056
Yeah, you are.

19:04.810 --> 19:08.605
Dude, I forgot how much
I miss performing--

19:08.689 --> 19:10.858
I mean, teaching... Um...

19:12.234 --> 19:13.777
in front of a classroom.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.947
Um... Miss... Mads, um...

19:17.865 --> 19:19.116
a student just texted me.

19:19.199 --> 19:21.410
There's a riot
in Ms. Lopez's Spanish class.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.663
Oh, dammit, Ruthie.
Just when I was getting my teach on,

19:24.746 --> 19:26.874
now I gotta go back
to being a principal again.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.045
I sent up the Bat-Signal,
and here's Batman.

19:33.005 --> 19:33.839
[panting] Hey.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.634
I got your text. Let's make this quick.
I'm not supposed to be here.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.053
This reminds me
of when I see you at the drive-through.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.436
Yeah, I'm not supposed to be there either.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.105
Stupid keto diet.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.859
Okay, quick.
You hit me with the mnemonic devices

19:53.942 --> 19:55.944
-and I'll pass them on to the class.
-Okay.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.947
The main reason
for the Spanish-American War

19:59.031 --> 20:01.867
was the sinking of the USS Maine.

20:01.950 --> 20:05.120
-Main reason, Maine, got it.
-[Gabe] Yeah.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.750
Didn't have you pegged for a scab, Gabe.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.585
-Mr. Hayward?
-[Ray] Yeah.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.962
Whoo, I thought it was Baby Leg.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.677
Just want you to know,
I support the union, Mr. Hayward.

20:20.761 --> 20:23.305
Then you understand
I have to break his arm.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.308
-What?
-Got your attention, huh?

20:26.516 --> 20:27.559
[Gabe] Mm-hmm.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.857
Since you didn't go into the school and...

20:34.149 --> 20:35.901
I know how much
you care about young people,

20:36.526 --> 20:37.819
I'mma give you a pass.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.988
-And just so you know...
-Mmm?

20:40.322 --> 20:41.865
...your bat would break on these guns.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.450
Yeah, yeah. Impressive.

20:43.533 --> 20:45.661
Want me to put this chicken wing down
and test it?

20:45.744 --> 20:47.913
-Oh, hey.
-[both chuckle]

20:48.872 --> 20:51.166
Mr. Hayward, my students have come so far.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.293
You know, when the semester first started,

20:53.377 --> 20:55.420
Mikey thought Mussolini was a pasta.

20:55.963 --> 20:59.591
-Mussolini Alfredo.
-[both chuckle]

20:59.675 --> 21:01.927
Yeah, put a little cream sauce
on it, and...

21:02.010 --> 21:04.930
anything tastes better,
including fascism.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.642
The point is, I know my kids
could beat the honors students,

21:08.725 --> 21:10.352
and I feel like I'm letting them down.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.020
See, that's where the game is rigged.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.190
No one chooses to be a teacher
without caring about young people.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.275
What about Tony?

21:16.358 --> 21:17.693
Okay, almost nobody.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.781
[sighs]
But I really need to be there for my kids.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.408
Well, there is a way.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.369
How? I can't go back to the school,
you still have a bat.

21:28.787 --> 21:32.332
You don't need a school to teach kids,
you just need kids.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.961
Okay, so, I'll take care of my students,

21:36.044 --> 21:38.171
-and you take care of the teachers.
-Yeah.

21:38.463 --> 21:39.464
[smacks lips]

21:40.090 --> 21:41.216
-Eh...
-[Ray] Hmm.

21:41.591 --> 21:43.593
[chuckles]

21:44.928 --> 21:48.765
-[Gabe sighs]
-All right, Lucille. Time to get freaky.

21:48.890 --> 21:50.183
[chuckles]

21:59.026 --> 22:00.152
-[Marisol] Hey.
-Hey.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.906
Um, are you sure this is okay?

22:04.990 --> 22:08.160
Between us, no, but if anyone asks, yes.

22:08.243 --> 22:10.245
This is like The Magic School Bus.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.497
Ha! Where to next, Ms. Frizzle?

22:12.998 --> 22:14.916
[all laugh]

22:16.752 --> 22:18.045
-Road trip.
-Yeah.

22:18.128 --> 22:21.506
Where are we heading? Tijuana?
Vegas? Amsterdam?

22:22.174 --> 22:24.718
Well, we're taking a field trip to...

22:24.801 --> 22:26.803
our new classroom.

22:28.805 --> 22:29.806
Aw, man.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.767
Can you drop me off in Vegas?

22:35.437 --> 22:38.065
-Dude, I'm sitting here.
-It's the same seat, I called it!

22:38.148 --> 22:39.107
Same seat?

22:39.191 --> 22:40.859
You've never been in my car before.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.027
[clicks tongue]

22:44.863 --> 22:46.907
[sighs] Where are we going, Mr. Iglesias?

22:46.990 --> 22:48.325
Knowledge Avenue.

22:48.408 --> 22:49.951
That street blows.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.622
[panting] Take the surface streets.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.249
Serpentine, okay?
If you're driving to the airport,

22:56.333 --> 22:58.585
helicopters can't follow you
into that airspace.

23:00.629 --> 23:01.838
Good to know.

23:01.922 --> 23:04.132
Hey, you might wanna grab
your emotional support Walt.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.302
[both breathing deeply]

23:10.972 --> 23:15.143
Okay, Gabriel, make sure you teach 'em
how unions built this country.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.270
Teddy Roosevelt.

23:17.354 --> 23:23.443
Rough Rider, trust buster,
and our greatest bespectacled president.

23:26.029 --> 23:26.863
Okay.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.533
I'm off to bust
some anti-union heads, huh?

23:29.616 --> 23:30.534
All right.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.414
He's kidding, you guys.
He's not really gonna bust any heads.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.499
He mostly works on limbs.

23:41.503 --> 23:42.671
I'll have a 7 and 7.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.382
Is that how old you are? Seven and seven?

23:45.590 --> 23:49.511
[chuckles] Math humor, I dig it.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.721
Well, speaking of numbers,
maybe you give me yours?

23:51.805 --> 23:52.848
[laughs]

23:54.141 --> 23:56.977
Oh, step away from the bar, buddy.
[chuckles]

23:57.561 --> 24:00.397
One more question or you're gonna get
hosed down with the club-soda gun.

24:01.648 --> 24:02.732
All right...

24:03.942 --> 24:06.319
-The War of 1812.
-Ooh!

24:06.403 --> 24:07.904
Ooh! 1812.

24:11.324 --> 24:12.784
Not what I was gonna ask,

24:12.868 --> 24:13.785
but you nailed it.

24:15.954 --> 24:16.788
Paula.

24:17.372 --> 24:19.332
I told you we were being followed!

24:19.833 --> 24:21.626
-Serpentine, man. Serpentine.
-It's okay.

24:23.211 --> 24:24.421
There you guys are.

24:24.504 --> 24:26.798
I've been looking
for you dangerous minds.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.968
Uh, why would you be looking for them?
They haven't done anything wrong.

24:30.051 --> 24:31.428
Though, Walt has tried.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.307
I just want to help them get ready
for the decathlon.

24:35.390 --> 24:37.851
After all, I am their teacher
until the strike is over.

24:38.143 --> 24:41.396
Let me guess, after a few minutes,
Carlos needed to lie down?

24:41.605 --> 24:45.567
Mm-hmm. Truth be told, I almost did too.
Mm.

24:47.319 --> 24:51.198
I forgot how hard this was.
I'm a little rusty, I could use some tips.

24:51.823 --> 24:54.576
Well, the key is to coat their medicine
in delicious peanut butter.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.453
-That makes us sound like dogs.
-Shh!

24:56.536 --> 24:58.330
We're about to get
delicious peanut butter.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.375
What are you talking about?

25:02.959 --> 25:04.669
Watch. Walt, you ready?

25:06.004 --> 25:09.508
Who did Richard Nixon defeat in 1968
to win the election?

25:10.091 --> 25:10.926
Oh, I got this.

25:11.009 --> 25:14.179
You taught me that the election in '68
was like WrestleMania 28.

25:14.971 --> 25:17.641
-Of course he did. Big deal.
-Walt?

25:18.308 --> 25:21.520
And the Undertaker defeated Triple H.
The Undertaker was Nixon...

25:22.145 --> 25:23.355
Obviously.

25:24.564 --> 25:26.358
And Triple H, Hubert H. Humphrey.

25:26.441 --> 25:27.817
Boom! Ha!

25:27.901 --> 25:31.446
Time to play the game. Walt for the win.

25:32.739 --> 25:35.450
-Damn, Gabe. I am impressed.
-Hmm?

25:35.534 --> 25:38.495
I remember making those light bulbs go on
when I was a teacher.

25:38.578 --> 25:39.704
Felt pretty good, huh?

25:39.788 --> 25:40.914
For sure.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.501
[sighs] I think I'm gonna dive back in
next semester.

25:44.751 --> 25:47.170
You know, plenty of principals
teach classes to stay sharp.

25:47.462 --> 25:50.090
You don't need to teach a class
to stay sharp, Miss Mads.

25:51.341 --> 25:54.010
You're looking sharp anytime
you pour yourself into a dress.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.516
See what you've been missing?

26:00.433 --> 26:01.518

26:02.978 --> 26:04.980
[lip-synching to Spanish lyrics]

26:13.822 --> 26:15.365
Surface streets, surface streets!

26:17.617 --> 26:20.579
