they're selling here.

11:24.451 --> 11:28.119
<i>Youth. Vitality. Vigor.</i>

11:28.121 --> 11:29.854
<i>Welcome to aterna.</i>

11:29.856 --> 11:31.289
<i>I'm dr. Frederick gardner.</i>

11:31.291 --> 11:34.359
<i>Let me ask you</i>
<i>one simple question --</i>

11:34.361 --> 11:37.462
<i>Do you want to live forever?</i>

11:37.464 --> 11:39.798
<i>I thought so.</i>

11:43.636 --> 11:44.969
What exactly is it
that you sell here, doctor?

11:44.971 --> 11:46.638
Youth. Vitality.

11:46.640 --> 11:49.407
Vigor. Yeah -- we heard.
But specifically?

11:49.409 --> 11:51.576
Our premier product
is called aterna.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.812
It's essentially
a high-end supplement

11:53.814 --> 11:55.647
That has revolutionized
aging.

11:55.649 --> 11:57.048
How high-end
are we talking?

11:57.050 --> 11:59.718
Well, given the proprietary
nature of the research,

11:59.720 --> 12:02.887
A regimen of aterna
can get quite pricy.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.155
Here's our menu list.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.991
Your clients spend
thousands of dollars a week

12:06.993 --> 12:08.827
Just to look young?
[ chuckles ] no.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.829
To <i>be</i> young, detective.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.598
Aterna makes you
a better version of yourself.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.834
There's a reason
professional athletes

12:15.836 --> 12:17.836
Turn to
performance-enhancing drugs

12:17.838 --> 12:20.171
<i>And</i> a reason
why they were banned.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.573
It's because they worked.

12:21.575 --> 12:22.841
For the rest of us,

12:22.843 --> 12:24.909
We can literally
turn back the clock.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.678
This is the future
of medicine.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.947
Except that
one of your patients died.

12:28.949 --> 12:32.217
Well, we don't guarantee
everlasting life --

12:32.219 --> 12:34.619
Just more vitality
while you're here.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.788
The reality is
many of our clientele

12:36.790 --> 12:38.790
Are in the twilight
of their years.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.458
Unless it was your product
that killed him.

12:40.460 --> 12:41.893
We take every measure

12:41.895 --> 12:44.362
To make sure
aterna is completely safe.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.531
We're registered
with the fda.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.700
If I thought there was
anything dangerous about aterna,

12:48.702 --> 12:50.268
I wouldn't drink it
every day.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.538
So, tell me, doctor,
what exactly is in it?

12:53.540 --> 12:54.939
Well,
it's a bit complex.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.875
I'll try and keep up.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.878
Let's say we took into account
the newest research

12:59.880 --> 13:01.546
In human growth hormone --

13:01.548 --> 13:03.548
Coenzyme q10,
testosterone,

13:03.550 --> 13:07.385
Ta-65, and others.
Mm, yeah, about that --
we're gonna need

13:07.387 --> 13:09.988
A sample to take with us.
[ scoffs ]
I'm sorry, detective.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.156
Demand has been so high

13:11.158 --> 13:13.057
That we have a waiting list
a mile long.

13:13.059 --> 13:16.227
I don't think you understand.
This is an nypd investigation.

13:16.229 --> 13:19.631
Well, if that's true, I would
feel much more comfortable

13:19.633 --> 13:20.832
If you had a warrant.

13:20.834 --> 13:24.903
Dr. Gardner? May I speak
with you for a moment?

13:26.005 --> 13:27.505
Privately.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.973
Excuse me.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.911
Dr. Gardner's had

13:32.913 --> 13:35.313
Two very skillful
plastic-surgery procedures.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.583
He's had his jaw line
shaved down and a rhinoplasty.

13:38.585 --> 13:39.984
So he's a little vain.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.753
That's what they're selling
around here.

13:41.755 --> 13:42.987
One procedure's
very feminizing,

13:42.989 --> 13:44.923
And the other's
made his nose longer.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.858
Both very strange
choices

13:46.860 --> 13:48.693
For a man who cares so much
about his appearance.

13:48.695 --> 13:49.861
Yeah,
but not for someone

13:49.863 --> 13:51.863
Who's looking to drastically
change himself.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.767
[ inhales sharply ]
things are piling up.

13:55.769 --> 13:56.935
I need to get back
to my patients.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.303
Thank you so much
for your time.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.038
What you're doing here
sounds amazing.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.708
You don't happen to have
a card, do you?

14:03.710 --> 14:06.110
Well, sure.
There's one in my office.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.680
It's right this way.
Does it have
your personal number?

14:08.682 --> 14:11.916
I mean, just in case
I have a question.

14:14.286 --> 14:15.620
Man: There you are.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.789
Thanks.

14:22.127 --> 14:24.028
I beg your pardon.
I'm sorry to bother you.

14:24.030 --> 14:27.298
I'm new here, and, uh...
I'm a little bit hesitant.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.968
How has your
experience been?
Amazing.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.870
You have nothing
to be worried about.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.204
I mean,
aterna's changed my life.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.807
I'm sure, I guess,
that wasn't too hard.

14:35.809 --> 14:37.408
Because
of your recent divorce?

14:37.410 --> 14:38.977
How did
you know that?

14:38.979 --> 14:41.045
You're reading
a magazine

14:41.047 --> 14:42.981
With a subscription label
that calls you "mrs.,"

14:42.983 --> 14:44.883
And yet you don't have
a wedding ring.

14:46.485 --> 14:48.052
He wanted
the younger model.

14:48.054 --> 14:51.089
Well, that was foolish
on his part.
Mm.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.423
Careful.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.893
Oh!
Ooh. Oh, I'm so sorry!

14:54.895 --> 14:56.995
[ chuckling ] it's fine.
I'm a klutz.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.763
Please. Allow me.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.498
Thank you. It's fine.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.000
Oh.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.001
Thank you.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.904
Uh,
for what it's worth...

15:05.906 --> 15:08.907
From my perspective,
you don't need aterna.

15:08.909 --> 15:13.311
Well, you're just saying that
because I'm on it.

15:15.414 --> 15:18.917
Were you just flirting
with that woman?

15:18.919 --> 15:22.086
She had a kind smile.
But purely for research.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.522
I want to know
what's inside this.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.024
Very suave.

15:26.026 --> 15:29.127
While you were doing that,
I lifted the doctor's prints.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.930
What are the chances
dr. Gardner's hiding something?

15:31.932 --> 15:36.701

<i>do you want to live forever?</i>

15:36.703 --> 15:38.036
[ <i>chuckles</i> ]

15:39.939 --> 15:42.106
The future of medicine is here.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.542
Hudson valley sanitarium
will be open for business

15:44.544 --> 15:47.045
With all the newest
and most relevant equipment.

15:47.047 --> 15:50.782
Electrotherapy, hydrotherapy --
scientifically proven

15:50.784 --> 15:52.383
To treat everything
from neuralgia

15:52.385 --> 15:54.953
To tuberculosis
and tic douloureux.

this nonsense?

16:03.964 --> 16:05.263
Well, I think
people will do anything

16:05.265 --> 16:08.666
To keep death at bay --

Man: Let's change that.
Me?

16:10.837 --> 16:12.236
How so?

16:12.238 --> 16:15.273
I seem to recall a certain
physician pleading for mercy

After an errant eve
at delmonico's.

James, these patients
are legitimately ill

And need the counsel
of real doctors.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.285
Oh, come on now,
henry.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.520
There's no need to take it
as a personal affront.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.089
But this man's
a charlatan,

16:31.091 --> 16:32.924
Giving these people
false hope.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.325
Look, medicine changes
so rapidly.

what the future holds?

of these wonder drugs

someday.

of this dungeon of death.

I'm not studying death.

on a wonder drug --

A modern-day
fountain of youth.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.784
Speaking for all of us
septuagenarians,

16:59.786 --> 17:01.352
I must ask,
does it work?

17:01.354 --> 17:05.023
It's too early to tell,
but my instinct is probably not.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.125
I can't even decipher
what's in it.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.027
What have
you found so far?

17:09.029 --> 17:11.195
Well, it seems to be
a blend of hormones

17:11.197 --> 17:13.297
Mixed with concentrated doses
of vitamins and minerals

17:13.299 --> 17:16.034
And some sort of
mammalian cellular matter.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.135
Beef protein, perhaps?

17:17.137 --> 17:19.137
Sounds delicious.
Maybe I should try it.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.973
Oh, I'd be careful.
The decedent looked great --

17:21.975 --> 17:23.975
Had the body of a man
half his age,

17:23.977 --> 17:25.376
But his brain
was full of holes.

17:25.378 --> 17:30.081
Ah. Well, maybe I'll hold off.
Age gracefully, like you.

Traces of ubiquinol,
idebenone, fluoxymesterone,

from astragalus membranaceus.

These are cheaper variations.
He's been cutting corners.

18:51.064 --> 18:53.164
And if he is,
he may have put in something

18:53.166 --> 18:55.133

to his patients' brains.

But as you can see,
I have company in my home.

20:51.251 --> 20:54.018
I'm confused.
Whose home is this?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.753
Dr. Gardner's
or mr. Price's?

21:06.099 --> 21:07.765
He opened a wellness clinic

Where two patients died.
That was not my fault.

nothing to do with their deaths.
I have no doubt.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.560
So, the killer likely entered
here coming from the pool.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.695
He attacked dr. Gardner
from behind

22:44.697 --> 22:46.464
With an arm

22:46.466 --> 22:48.532

He was stabbed in the fifth

That is massively unlucky.

We didn't even know it was a

25:45.144 --> 25:47.545
And then it took us
another 20 years to learn

25:47.547 --> 25:49.713
That it can be transmitted
via infected cow's milk.

25:49.715 --> 25:52.750
Okay, so how does that
tie into our case?

25:52.752 --> 25:54.652
I was looking
for a compound in aterna

25:54.654 --> 25:56.153
That could be causing
this damage,

25:56.155 --> 25:58.856
But what if the aterna itself
was infected with something?

25:58.858 --> 26:00.858
Wouldn't you have seen it
on the tox report?

26:00.860 --> 26:02.860
Not if it was
a prion disease.
A what?

26:02.862 --> 26:05.062

bacterial nor viral.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.665
And they're not alive.
They're simply bits of protein.

26:07.667 --> 26:10.501
That's why they never
showed up on any tests.

prions infect you,
