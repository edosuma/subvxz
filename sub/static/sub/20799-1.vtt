00:42.792 --> 00:46.712
(woman) Your Highness, please allow
me to make this little contribution.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.131
(man) No, I cannot accept them.

00:49.966 --> 00:52.384
(woman) But think of what
these could do for your cause.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.804
(man) Even though I know they would
mean freedom for many of my people,

00:55.972 --> 00:59.808
- I will not take them.
- (woman) Please. Please!

01:00.310 --> 01:02.227
These could save the lives of many men.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.354
(man) The men of my country are proud.

01:04.522 --> 01:07.483
They would die rather than have
their prince accept charity.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.944
(woman) Then think of the lives
of the women, the mothers...

01:11.112 --> 01:13.947
(man) The women of my country
fight alongside the men.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.950
They are also too
proud to accept charity.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.370
(woman) Then consider
the lives of the children.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.499
The innocent children.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.045
(man) But... for the children.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.143
She's the blonde in
the blue sequined dress.

03:48.811 --> 03:51.855
Extremely rich, very married,

03:52.023 --> 03:55.817
eminently corruptible
and a willing infidel.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.576
Perfect.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.553
<i>(croupier) Faites vos jeuх!</i>

04:34.983 --> 04:36.692
<i>Rien ne va plus!</i>

04:44.409 --> 04:46.034
<i>Sept rouge, inpair et manque!</i>

04:56.296 --> 04:57.879
<i>Faites vos jeuх, messieurs!</i>

04:59.048 --> 05:02.050
Monsieur Andre, would you
see what you can get for this?

05:02.218 --> 05:05.512
- Not the royal ring, Your Highness?
- Shh!

05:05.680 --> 05:07.723
Do you want the whole world to know?

05:27.452 --> 05:31.163
Excuse me. Is that man
there truly royalty?

05:32.498 --> 05:35.250
- No, Madame.
- But you called him "Your Highness."

05:35.418 --> 05:37.711
It was a faux pas. Please forget it.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.422
You can trust me, I won't tell.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.676
Madame, I am the police
chief of Beaumont-sur-Mer.

05:44.844 --> 05:48.096
What makes you Americans think
you can buy anyone at any price?

05:48.264 --> 05:50.307
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No!

05:50.475 --> 05:52.142
I've already caused the prince enough...

05:52.310 --> 05:53.727
Prince?

05:56.314 --> 05:59.941
He sounded like he was in
trouble. Perhaps I can help.

06:00.109 --> 06:01.777
If you really want to help,

06:01.944 --> 06:04.613
forget everything that
you have seen and heard.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.698
Forget the very existence...

06:06.866 --> 06:10.160
...of that brilliant,
extraordinary man...

06:11.245 --> 06:12.662
...of destiny.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.297
Your Highness...

06:24.217 --> 06:27.386
Your Highness, don't be
alarmed. I can be trusted.

06:27.887 --> 06:31.348
- Are you one of my subjects?
- No. I'm an American.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.517
Fanny Eubanks of Omaha.

06:34.644 --> 06:38.730
I couldn't help overhearing. If
you're in trouble and I can help...

06:38.898 --> 06:41.900
Thank you. But I cannot accept.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.903
You've already risked too
much just in speaking to me.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.738
I still wanna help.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.954
You must understand. I
have powerful enemies.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.164
They may be watching even as we...

06:57.708 --> 07:00.085
My God, you're attractive.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.004
It's late.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.884
I must go.

07:14.183 --> 07:17.018
- Has he left?
- Yes. Just a moment ago.

07:17.186 --> 07:18.812
Good.

07:18.980 --> 07:22.816
Please. You must tell me where he lives.

07:25.528 --> 07:30.449
- I feel it only fair to warn you...
- I know he has powerful enemies.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.535
There may also be an emotional risk.

07:34.203 --> 07:37.164
You see, His Highness has
been a widower for five years.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.584
For five years?

07:46.132 --> 07:48.133
(Fanny) Please, Your Highness.

07:49.051 --> 07:52.929
("Prince") Fanny... the
Freedom Fighters thank you.

07:56.058 --> 07:57.726
This is for the overhead.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.562
This goes to you, Arthur.

08:01.397 --> 08:03.356
This goes to you, Andre.

08:03.983 --> 08:07.819
This goes to me... which means
it's time to go to Zurich.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.634
Excuse me. May I sit here, please?

09:13.386 --> 09:14.970
- If you like.
- Thank you.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.849
Good evening, sir. Would
you like to see the menu?

09:20.017 --> 09:22.227
Oh, yes. I'm starving.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.062
Really starving.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.818
Oh! Prices.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.486
Woo!

09:33.489 --> 09:35.365
I think I'll just have some water.

09:36.158 --> 09:38.243
- Water?
- Yes.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.668
Only water? But you seemed so hungry.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.589
I'm saving my money
for something special.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.800
- My mother.
- Your mother?

09:54.719 --> 09:58.638
Well, she's not really my mother.
Actually, she's my grandmother.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.515
But she raised me.

10:02.018 --> 10:05.312
My real parents... didn't want me.

10:06.856 --> 10:10.150
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- But my grandmother is wonderful.

10:10.318 --> 10:14.237
She has a laugh that
can make the birds sing.

10:17.283 --> 10:21.703
But she's been quite ill lately... and
the hospital bills have been adding up.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.831
I just wanna do my share.

10:25.708 --> 10:29.711
It's kinda tough for me because
I was never very good with money.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.172
I just seem to take what
the Red Cross pays me

10:32.340 --> 10:34.215
and I give it right back to them.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.888
But I am going to help my gram-gram.

10:41.724 --> 10:47.020
She is the one who taught me it is
better to be truthful and good...

10:48.731 --> 10:50.398
..than to not.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.911
- Waiter!
- What are you doing?

11:03.579 --> 11:04.913
Waiter.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.919
- Give this man whatever he wants.
- I can't let you buy me a meal!

11:11.087 --> 11:12.545
Nonsense.

11:15.633 --> 11:19.761
I'll have a double turkey sandwich
on white, fries, a large knockwurst,

11:19.929 --> 11:22.555
three bags of chips, a
chocolate milk and two beers.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.808
Why don't you have a beer? Three beers.

11:24.975 --> 11:26.434
Thank you.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.417
Forgot I had a first-class ticket.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.043
(chuckles)

11:56.340 --> 11:58.049
- That bother you?
- No.

12:00.386 --> 12:04.931
<i>â™?I love to love you in the night...</i>

12:05.099 --> 12:08.435
I couldn't help overhearing your
conversation in the dining car.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.812
My condolences to your grandmother.

12:11.439 --> 12:12.480
Huh?

12:12.648 --> 12:13.982
Oh!

12:14.150 --> 12:17.736
Oh... right.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.155
Didn't you say she was taken ill?

12:20.823 --> 12:23.658
I tell 'em what they wanna
hear if it gets me what I want.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.121
Rather a shabby trick, isn't it?

12:30.332 --> 12:32.375
I can tell you've got a
lot to learn about women.

12:33.669 --> 12:36.963
Yes, I'm afraid I am a bit naive
when it comes to the weaker sex.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.180
Freddy Benson.

12:47.016 --> 12:50.727
- And you are?
- Lawrence Jamieson.

12:53.230 --> 12:56.065
- You're married, aren't you?
- You can tell?

12:58.194 --> 12:59.527
Listen.

13:00.279 --> 13:03.198
We're the weaker sex. Men
don't live as long as women.

13:03.365 --> 13:07.285
We get more heart attacks, more
strokes, more prostate trouble.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.205
I say it's time for a change.

13:10.372 --> 13:14.292
I say let them give us money.
Let's live off them for a while.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.712
That probably shocks
a guy like you, right?

13:17.880 --> 13:20.548
Well, it's rather a
revolutionary thought.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.550
Do you really think it's possible?

13:22.718 --> 13:24.636
(laughs)

13:24.804 --> 13:27.847
Look what I did in the dining
car! She gave me 100 francs.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.558
That's like, uh... 20 bucks!

13:30.726 --> 13:34.145
Do you have any idea what it feels
like to take a woman for 20 bucks?

13:34.313 --> 13:36.147
No, I haven't.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.233
I'm afraid it's a
little out of my class.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.734
(tuts)

13:40.945 --> 13:42.737
- What?
- It's too bad.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.406
We could've had a blast on the Riviera.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.497
- You're headed for the Riviera?
- Yeah.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.334
There's a little town there, supposed
to be crawling with rich women.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.629
Oh. And what town is that?

14:00.923 --> 14:03.258
Uh...
Beaumont-sur-Mer.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.637
Beaumont-sur-Mer?
(laughs)

14:07.805 --> 14:10.098
I'm afraid you've been misinformed.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.683
Beaumont used to be lively,

14:11.851 --> 14:15.144
but it's been taken over
by older, retired couples.

14:15.312 --> 14:18.731
- Older, retired couples? Are you sure?
- Yes, I live there.

14:18.899 --> 14:21.276
I'm considered to be the town's playboy.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.279
(whistles)

14:24.446 --> 14:27.740
All the social activity has
gone to the Italian Riviera.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.158
Portofino.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.245
(exhales)

14:32.413 --> 14:33.955
Still doesn't hurt to check it out.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.374
Some of these sleepy
towns really pay off.

14:38.711 --> 14:42.630
Would you excuse me? I have
to phone my wife and children.

14:42.798 --> 14:45.550
I like to let them know
what time I'm arriving.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.970
- They really got you on a leash.
- Afraid so.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.916
Well, here we are.

15:26.842 --> 15:29.844
- Older, retired couples?
- (Lawrence chuckles)

15:30.012 --> 15:32.013
- You have a ride into town?
- Yes, I have.

15:32.181 --> 15:35.016
- Great. You can give me lift.
- Do you have a hotel room?

15:35.184 --> 15:36.517
I never make reservations.

15:36.685 --> 15:39.187
Excuse me. Is this the Portofino train?

15:39.355 --> 15:41.814
Yes, it is. But we're
getting off, right?

15:42.650 --> 15:43.858
Scusi.

15:47.863 --> 15:50.031
- We're getting off, right?
- Uh...

15:52.743 --> 15:54.160
(Freddy) Gee.

15:54.328 --> 15:57.121
- How far up is Portofino?
- (woman) Portofino?

15:57.831 --> 16:00.667
It's about 170 km. I live there.

16:00.834 --> 16:03.002
- No!
- Yes!

16:03.879 --> 16:06.547
Come and stay with me. You
can go to Portofino later.

16:06.715 --> 16:09.884
I would love to, but my grandmother
is there and she's expecting me.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.220
Your grandmother is living in Portofino?

16:12.388 --> 16:14.722
Yes. Actually, she's quite ill.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.725
Well, good luck. Give my
best to your grandmother.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.477
I hope her health improves.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.521
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

16:21.689 --> 16:22.897
Ciao.

16:34.743 --> 16:37.078
Your phone call did
not give me much time.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.246
Marion was perfect.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.499
Make sure she gets
back all right, Andre.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.837
May I ask why she was necessary?

16:46.005 --> 16:49.465
I needed a decoy. This idiot
was sharing my compartment.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.926
He fancied himself as a bit of a player.

16:52.094 --> 16:55.013
Said he was going to do some
hunting in my Beaumont-sur-Mer.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.516
Monsieur Lawrence, you can
afford to dismiss such amateurs.

16:58.684 --> 17:02.270
- Surely he was no match for you?
- You can't be too careful, Andre.

17:02.688 --> 17:06.023
A poacher who shoots at
rabbits may scare big game away.

17:25.752 --> 17:28.671
Hey, Lawrence, listen to this.

17:28.839 --> 17:33.134
"A clever, young American con
artist, nicknamed The Jackal,

17:33.302 --> 17:36.220
has been working Western Europe."

17:37.347 --> 17:40.433
If he's in the papers,
how clever can he be?

17:40.601 --> 17:44.645
Now, to business. Krista Knudsen.

17:45.939 --> 17:50.401
Widow of Lars Knudsen,
the Danish match king.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.657
She left the Excelsior Hotel in Genoa

17:56.825 --> 18:00.995
at 0740 hours this
morning in a white Ferrari.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.664
She should be arriving
at approximately...

18:04.625 --> 18:06.250
Ah-hah!

18:06.418 --> 18:08.127
Here she is now.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.633
(woman) I would like to
help your grandmother.

18:13.801 --> 18:18.721
- I got some money here.
- (Freddy) Oh, no. I wouldn't accept it.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.891
That's strange. There's
a young man with her.

18:23.018 --> 18:26.521
- Please, I insist. I insist.
- I'm gonna pay you back.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.649
- The poacher?
- Yes.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.444
And he's no longer
satisfied with rabbits.

18:33.612 --> 18:37.573
Monsieur Police Inspector, can
you arrange something for me?

18:38.492 --> 18:40.576
- I'm gonna pay you back, though.
- No!

18:42.913 --> 18:44.497
The usual?

18:49.711 --> 19:00.555
<i>Bonjour!</i>

19:02.057 --> 19:04.016
Hey! Encore, encore!

19:08.897 --> 19:11.524
(Freddy whoops)

19:22.119 --> 19:24.036
Yee-ha!

19:24.496 --> 19:25.580
<i>â™?Da da-da da da</i>

19:25.747 --> 19:26.747
<i>â™?Da-da
da-da da da</i>

19:26.915 --> 19:29.083
<i>â™?Da-da da-da
da da daa!</i>

19:30.502 --> 19:31.752
Monsieur!

19:33.881 --> 19:35.131
<i>Merci.</i>

19:40.554 --> 19:43.764
Something like this, OK? All
right, here we go! Here we go!

19:46.393 --> 19:49.562
OK. Two more! Two more. How much is it?

19:54.109 --> 19:56.944
Have you seen enough, Mrs. Knudsen?

19:57.112 --> 20:00.281
That money was to go toward an
operation for his grandmother!

20:00.449 --> 20:02.658
Here we go! Ha ha haa!

20:04.411 --> 20:08.497
He's a confidence man. A trickster.
Will Madame sign the complaint?

20:09.499 --> 20:10.917
Gladly.

20:16.423 --> 20:19.675
I told you, I didn't steal any
money from her! She gave it to me.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.844
She filed this complaint against you.

20:22.012 --> 20:26.140
She caught me with another woman.
You're French, you understand that!

20:26.308 --> 20:28.935
To be with another
woman, that is French.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.853
To be caught, that is American.

20:31.021 --> 20:34.815
God! All right, what am I gonna
do? How am I gonna get out of here?

20:34.983 --> 20:36.234
It's very difficult.

20:36.401 --> 20:39.946
The charge is a serious one and
you are a vagrant, an unknown.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.822
Listen, I'm not a vagrant!

20:41.990 --> 20:43.491
This is my point!

20:44.159 --> 20:48.746
I know somebody here. I met
him on a train. His name is...

20:53.168 --> 20:56.837
His name is... James... No.

20:57.005 --> 21:00.591
His name is... James Josephson.

21:00.759 --> 21:01.801
Oh, no, no!

21:01.969 --> 21:04.303
James Lawrence. Lawrence! Lawrence!

21:07.015 --> 21:08.349
Lawrence...

21:09.685 --> 21:12.061
Lawrence Fells. Lawrence Fings.

21:12.896 --> 21:15.147
Forest Lawrenceton.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.526
La... Lars. Lars!

21:19.945 --> 21:23.698
Lawrence. Lawrence Lacko...

21:26.368 --> 21:27.910
Lawrence...

21:28.620 --> 21:30.538
His name is James Jessenden.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.999
Lawrence Fells. Lawrence Jesterton.

21:33.166 --> 21:34.959
Lawrence Jesterton.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.212
- Lawrence Jamieson?
- Yes!

21:38.380 --> 21:42.550
Yes! Yes! We're like this!

21:50.559 --> 21:53.769
Freddy. This is really very serious.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.814
They don't treat gigolos
lightly in France.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.065
What do you mean?

21:58.233 --> 22:00.985
Until 75 years ago, they
were still castrating them.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.279
Don't say that word!

22:04.323 --> 22:07.616
- What do they do now?
- Well, that depends who the judge is.

22:09.077 --> 22:12.580
<i>- Inspecteur, qui est le juge?
- (chuckles) Reynoux.</i>

22:12.748 --> 22:15.416
Oh. Judge Reynoux.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.960
(both inhale)

22:18.128 --> 22:21.297
- Good luck, Freddy.
- No, you can't go. You gotta help me.

22:23.091 --> 22:27.178
- Do you have any money?
- Yeah, I got about 12... 900 dollars.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.764
No, I know this chap.
He'll want at least 5,000.

22:29.931 --> 22:31.515
5,000? I don't have 5,000!

22:31.683 --> 22:34.435
- Can you get it?
- I have it at home.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.395
I could fly home and mail him a check.

22:36.563 --> 22:37.897
OK.

22:39.232 --> 22:41.108
<i>- Inspecteur!
- Oui?</i>

22:41.276 --> 22:42.818
<i>Est-il possible...</i>

22:42.986 --> 22:45.321
(whispering)

22:48.450 --> 22:52.286
<i>Non! Non, non, pas possible! CrÃ©tin!</i>

22:55.165 --> 22:56.457
Freddy.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.879
He says you can
go... Ah-ah-ah!

23:02.047 --> 23:05.049
He's got to have the rest
of the money within 48 hours

23:05.217 --> 23:10.429
or he'll submit your name to Interpol
and you'll never travel in Europe again.

23:10.597 --> 23:13.307
That's fine, that's fine.
Thank you, thank you.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.935
Thank you, Lawrence Jamieson.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.319
You know, I'm pretty
good at sizing people up,

23:25.487 --> 23:27.530
and I think you are one terrific guy.

23:28.490 --> 23:31.659
I suppose I get pleasure from
helping people like you out.

24:43.732 --> 24:47.234
- I see you know His Highness.
- Who?

24:48.445 --> 24:51.030
- The prince.
- The prince?

24:51.198 --> 24:54.617
I saw him shake your hand
and pat you on the back.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.370
No kidding!

24:59.080 --> 25:01.916
- And you are?
- Fanny Eubanks.

25:04.085 --> 25:07.338
Fanny Eubanks? Of Omaha?

25:08.507 --> 25:12.009
- Of Omaha?
- You don't have to cover up with me.

25:12.177 --> 25:16.222
It may be my money that's
financing your mission.

25:16.848 --> 25:18.933
You're financing my mission?

25:19.851 --> 25:22.061
Perhaps His Highness has mentioned me?

25:31.029 --> 25:34.448
Oh, Lady Fanny of Omaha?

25:34.616 --> 25:36.784
He called me Lady Fanny?

25:36.952 --> 25:40.120
Oh, yes. Lady Fanny of Omaha.

25:40.288 --> 25:42.122
He speaks of you with great affection.

25:42.290 --> 25:43.707
Drink, sir?

25:48.630 --> 25:50.589
You have done a wonderful thing.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.154
Sir.

26:14.322 --> 26:18.200
Excuse me. I'm very sorry, sir,
but the man said it was urgent.

26:19.035 --> 26:20.578
- What man?
- The courier, sir.

26:20.745 --> 26:22.246
He's waiting outside.

26:22.414 --> 26:26.083
He said you would recognize
the secret password.

26:26.960 --> 26:30.671
- What secret password?
- (Freddy) Lady Fanny of Omaha!

26:37.846 --> 26:39.263
Hi!

26:40.348 --> 26:44.184
Could you take this to the guest
bedroom and see everything is pressed?

26:44.352 --> 26:45.853
Go ahead, Arthur.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.273
Wow!

26:49.441 --> 26:52.067
Wo-ha-ha-how!
Wow!

26:52.235 --> 26:54.486
All I can say is "wow!"

26:54.654 --> 26:57.573
What an asshole I was
telling you how to take women!

26:58.366 --> 27:01.827
All right. How much do you want?

27:01.995 --> 27:04.705
Oh, Your Highness, I
don't want money from a man

27:04.873 --> 27:08.083
who needs every penny to
free his enslaved people.

27:08.251 --> 27:10.502
(laughs)

27:12.672 --> 27:15.382
- What do you want?
- This!

27:15.550 --> 27:18.927
This! I want this!

27:21.973 --> 27:23.724
This is what I want.

27:23.892 --> 27:27.519
I don't want money. I want you
to teach me. I'm in your hands.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.606
- You can't be serious.
- Larry...

27:30.774 --> 27:31.815
Lawrence.

27:31.983 --> 27:34.526
All my life, I wanted to
be the best at something.

27:34.694 --> 27:37.404
I thought I was, till I met you.

27:37.572 --> 27:40.699
I mean, I never realized how far you
could go with this scamming thing.

27:40.867 --> 27:44.078
- You've opened my eyes!
- Freddy, this "scamming" thing,

27:44.245 --> 27:46.955
as you put it, took me years to perfect.

27:48.416 --> 27:51.335
- I got time.
- Why should I help you?

27:52.712 --> 27:56.131
A guy with my mouth could ruin a
lot of business around here for you.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.183
What sort of an education did you have?

28:08.019 --> 28:09.436
High school diploma.

28:10.146 --> 28:11.563
And you majored in...?

28:12.857 --> 28:15.609
- Metal shop.
- Metal shop.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.126
All right. I'll do it.

28:32.293 --> 28:34.044
Ha ha haa!

28:34.212 --> 28:36.630
I'll teach you and pay you a percentage.

28:36.798 --> 28:39.758
- Great!
- But with this one understanding.

28:40.593 --> 28:43.721
I run this operation
and you do as I say.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.472
Great!

28:46.725 --> 28:50.728
- Classes begin after lunch.
- (Freddy laughs)

28:55.150 --> 28:57.651
I have a plan for this Jackal.

28:57.819 --> 28:59.570
There is a man who owes me a favor.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.656
RÃ©nÃ© the Knife. He is a
master with the stiletto,

29:02.824 --> 29:05.159
and an absolute magician
at hiding a body.

29:05.326 --> 29:07.202
- Andre...
- As police inspector,

29:07.370 --> 29:11.707
I give you my word, the case will be
investigated in a very slipshod manner.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.083
Stop worrying, Andre.

29:13.251 --> 29:15.419
I tell you, it is a
mistake to take him in!

29:15.587 --> 29:19.673
I am taking him in gracefully in
order to get him out gracefully.

29:19.841 --> 29:22.301
("Putting on the Ritz")

32:22.815 --> 32:25.567
- Well done!
- I look great, don't I?

32:25.735 --> 32:27.945
- I know the moves!
- Yes, you're ready.

32:28.112 --> 32:29.363
But remember our agreement.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.531
I'm in charge. You do exactly as I say.

32:31.699 --> 32:33.659
Exactly as you say!

32:35.536 --> 32:37.329
(slurps and gulps)

32:42.752 --> 32:44.378
I feel like a kept man.

32:46.631 --> 32:47.965
I'm sorry.

32:48.716 --> 32:51.510
I'm going to tell Andre
to tear up the check.

32:51.678 --> 32:55.889
Oh, no, you can't! I paid
the 100,000 francs in cash.

32:57.684 --> 32:58.809
Damn.

33:00.603 --> 33:02.396
Please don't be mad at me.

33:02.563 --> 33:05.399
He said he wouldn't let you
leave unless I paid off your loan.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.735
What else did he say?

33:09.278 --> 33:11.321
He told me how you needed
that money for your country,

33:11.489 --> 33:13.073
to fight the communists.

33:13.950 --> 33:16.118
It's just such a noble cause.

33:16.911 --> 33:19.871
Oh, please don't be angry with me.

33:20.039 --> 33:21.790
Pretty please!

33:21.958 --> 33:24.626
Here comes a creep man...
He's out to get you!

33:24.794 --> 33:26.420
There's that smile!

33:27.714 --> 33:31.341
Daddy says we're gonna have the
biggest weddin' Tulsa's ever seen.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.011
When do you think we can fly back?

33:35.013 --> 33:36.847
Perhaps we should go by ship.

33:37.432 --> 33:38.807
Oh! (giggles)

33:38.975 --> 33:40.726
Ruprecht loves the water.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.021
- R... Ruprecht?
- Yes, Ruprecht.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.566
Didn't I tell you about him?

33:48.484 --> 33:50.318
Ruprecht is my brother.

33:51.070 --> 33:54.322
- You have a brother?
- Yes, the young prince.

33:55.616 --> 33:59.119
You mean I'm goin'
home with two princes?

33:59.996 --> 34:02.956
Wherever I go, Ruprecht goes, too.

34:04.625 --> 34:08.587
- When do I meet him?
- He's in his room, even as we speak.

34:08.755 --> 34:11.630
- Would you like to meet him right now?
- I would love to.

34:23.643 --> 34:27.188
- What's he doin' out here?
- His quarters are here.

34:28.149 --> 34:30.692
(banging)

34:39.827 --> 34:43.288
I think I should warn you
that Ruprecht is, well, uh,

34:43.998 --> 34:45.331
...special.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.045
(banging stops)

34:51.214 --> 34:52.839
(rumbling)

34:54.467 --> 34:56.592
Ruprecht, it is I, your brother.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.429
No sudden moves.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.308
(clattering)

35:18.825 --> 35:21.159
You've been banging on your
pots again, haven't you?

35:26.374 --> 35:31.378
I told you, if you keep on doing
it, you won't have any pots left.

35:35.007 --> 35:36.842
(whimpers)

35:37.009 --> 35:39.010
All right.

35:40.888 --> 35:42.347
(Lawrence) Cuddly-cuddly.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.767
Oh, Ruprecht.

35:46.644 --> 35:49.729
Ruprecht, don't do that. Ruprecht, no!

35:50.815 --> 35:53.316
Stop it, Ruprecht! Ruprecht!

35:57.071 --> 35:58.530
He's very affectionate.

35:59.740 --> 36:02.909
Now, come along. Come along.

36:04.078 --> 36:07.914
Now, I want you to meet this nice lady.

36:08.749 --> 36:11.459
- Mother?
- No, this isn't your mother.

36:11.627 --> 36:15.505
- Not Mother?
- No. But I have wonderful news.

36:15.673 --> 36:18.466
Miss Trumble and I are
going to be married.

36:20.094 --> 36:22.137
And we are going to live in Oklahoma.

36:26.642 --> 36:28.268
Really?

36:31.189 --> 36:32.564
Oh dear.

36:38.654 --> 36:48.663
Ruprecht!

36:48.831 --> 36:52.334
We have a guest. What
do we do for guests?

36:53.336 --> 36:56.004
What did we do when Uncle Ted was here?

37:03.930 --> 37:04.930
No, Ruprecht.

37:08.184 --> 37:10.268
Ruprecht, no!

37:10.436 --> 37:12.145
After that.

37:14.815 --> 37:16.149
We apologize.

37:35.169 --> 37:36.461
Ruprecht!

37:41.342 --> 37:44.177
Ruprecht! You want the genital cuff?

37:48.266 --> 37:51.476
Don't worry, Ruprecht. We
won't go anywhere without you.

37:51.644 --> 37:57.023
Oklahoma! Oklahoma!
Oklahoma! Oklahoma! Oklahoma!

37:58.901 --> 38:01.695
He'll enjoy Oklahoma's
wide-open spaces.

38:01.862 --> 38:04.364
He loves to run and run and run.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.866
(Freddy chants)

38:20.423 --> 38:24.301
- Not Mother?
- No, Ruprecht. She's not our mother.

38:25.886 --> 38:29.973
- Go on, Diana. You were saying.
- Well, I think that... Ow!

38:30.141 --> 38:33.018
- Ruprecht!
- May I take your trident, sir?

38:33.185 --> 38:34.394
Yes.

38:34.562 --> 38:38.773
Now, you were saying. You don't think
the poor should be allowed in museums?

38:38.941 --> 38:40.608
- I think...
- Ruprecht.

38:40.776 --> 38:43.403
Don't take the cork off the fork.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.864
Why is the cork on the fork?

38:46.032 --> 38:48.908
To prevent him hurting
himself... and others.

38:49.076 --> 38:50.285
Ooh!

38:51.829 --> 38:53.496
Ruprecht, eat your apple sauce.

38:56.917 --> 39:00.420
Ruprecht, we have wonderful news.

39:02.173 --> 39:05.175
Diana and I are going to be married...

39:06.093 --> 39:08.428
...and we are all going
to live in Palm Beach.

39:09.930 --> 39:11.097
Ruprecht!

39:14.852 --> 39:17.729
- Eat your food.
- Excuse me.

39:17.897 --> 39:21.941
- May I go to the bathroom first?
- Of course you may.

39:35.539 --> 39:36.623
Thank you.

39:37.583 --> 39:38.750
(gasps)

39:43.214 --> 39:45.340
Driving relaxes Ruprecht.

39:46.926 --> 39:48.551
(toots horn)

39:52.473 --> 39:56.142
(Freddy) Oh, Lawrence, this
is the happiest day of my life!

39:56.310 --> 39:58.937
I think my testicles are dropping!

40:05.486 --> 40:07.487
It's been a very good month, chaps.

40:07.655 --> 40:10.156
Now, we've got 20% for the overhead.

40:10.866 --> 40:13.660
- For you, Arthur, it's 10%.
- Thank you, sir.

40:13.828 --> 40:14.828
Ow!

40:14.995 --> 40:17.997
- 15% for you, Andre.
- Nice work.

40:18.541 --> 40:20.333
And the rest is for me.

40:20.501 --> 40:23.086
- Au revoir, Lawrence.
- Au revoir, Andre.

40:29.218 --> 40:32.011
Excuse me! What about me? What do I get?

40:33.180 --> 40:36.015
You are the student,
Freddy. You get knowledge.

40:36.183 --> 40:39.436
Wait. I did most of the work. I
should get my share of the cash.

40:39.603 --> 40:42.856
I wouldn't dream of giving you
your share without being certain

40:43.023 --> 40:46.526
that you would spend it
wisely on beauty and culture.

40:46.694 --> 40:49.696
I've got culture coming out of my ass.

40:49.864 --> 40:52.699
Spending money is a
responsibility, Freddy.

40:53.784 --> 40:56.661
All right, all right. How am
I supposed to spend my money?

40:58.205 --> 41:01.040
Now, all these wines are very old.

41:01.208 --> 41:04.627
I purchased them to make certain
that they were cared for properly.

41:04.795 --> 41:09.007
- So you got a lot of wine to drink.
- You can't. They're far too valuable.

41:09.884 --> 41:12.135
- So you sell them?
- I'd never sell them.

41:12.303 --> 41:13.761
They mean too much to me.

41:16.640 --> 41:21.144
In Europe, Freddy, gardens take
centuries to grow and cultivate.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.645
This one was about to die,

41:22.813 --> 41:26.399
until Mrs. Everson's brooch
paid for its preservation.

41:26.567 --> 41:29.569
- What's the angle?
- There is no angle, Freddy.

41:35.868 --> 41:39.913
I rescued this from certain destruction
and donated it to the museum.

41:41.123 --> 41:43.583
Just looking at it feeds my soul.

41:45.002 --> 41:47.754
- May I say something here?
- Of course.

41:47.922 --> 41:49.589
Are you kidding me or what?!

41:51.258 --> 41:52.926
I don't get it.

41:53.093 --> 41:55.637
You want me to spend my
money on wine you can't drink,

41:55.804 --> 41:59.224
and a garden that, to me, looks
like a big mowing headache.

41:59.391 --> 42:03.269
It's true that is a sculpture of a
naked woman, and I can appreciate that.

42:03.437 --> 42:06.147
But otherwise, you
have got to be joking.

42:06.315 --> 42:08.525
You agreed to do what I say.

42:08.692 --> 42:11.110
Not to you telling
me how to spend money,

42:11.278 --> 42:14.030
and not to playing Ruprecht
the Monkey Boy all the time!

42:14.198 --> 42:16.199
I'm going it alone.

42:16.909 --> 42:18.201
Ugh!

42:18.369 --> 42:21.746
Freddy. You still have so much to learn.

42:21.914 --> 42:25.542
No, thanks. I was doing
great with my own look.

42:25.709 --> 42:28.294
I don't need these clothes
or your instructions.

42:28.462 --> 42:32.131
You taught me what you know.
Great. Thanks. Thanks a yahoo.

42:32.299 --> 42:33.967
I'm gettin' out of this town.

42:35.928 --> 42:37.303
Good luck.

42:55.656 --> 42:59.867
Well, the Jackal has finally tucked his
tail between his legs and crawled away.

43:00.035 --> 43:02.912
Good. Then it is business as usual, huh?

43:04.164 --> 43:06.791
- Au revoir, Lawrence.
- Au revoir, Andre.

43:06.959 --> 43:09.669
(Freddy) Oh, Miss! Miss!

43:11.046 --> 43:13.715
Excuse me. Where can I get
the Wall Street Journal?

43:13.882 --> 43:17.885
I'm trying to find out the stock prices
to see how my takeover bid is going.

43:18.053 --> 43:20.805
It's so hard to get the
stock prices around here.

43:22.099 --> 43:23.516
<i>Au revoir!</i>

43:25.853 --> 43:27.145
What are you doing here?

43:29.064 --> 43:30.940
You know, that's a funny story.

43:31.775 --> 43:34.944
I was at the train
station, ticket in hand,

43:35.112 --> 43:38.531
and I thought "What am I leaving
this place for? I love me here!"

43:38.699 --> 43:41.284
So, I'll be around a
little bit more. Lucky you.

43:41.452 --> 43:44.245
Freddy. Freddy!

43:45.331 --> 43:47.457
Freddy!

43:47.625 --> 43:51.628
There simply isn't enough room for
both of us to work Beaumont-sur-Mer.

43:52.296 --> 43:55.632
- You know what? I think you're scared.
- Of what?

43:55.799 --> 43:58.259
Competition. You've been
top dog here for so long,

43:58.427 --> 44:00.720
you think you own the place. Nice!

44:00.888 --> 44:03.056
Believe me, Freddy,
I'm not afraid of you.

44:03.223 --> 44:04.724
Sure you are, and you should be.

44:04.892 --> 44:07.727
I'm younger than you. I'm
better-looking than you.

44:08.687 --> 44:10.229
I'm thinner than you.

44:10.731 --> 44:13.691
I could kick your ass off
this hill in a New York minute.

44:14.234 --> 44:17.236
And I could have you arrested again.

44:22.201 --> 44:24.869
And I could always call
Lady Fanny of Omaha.

44:31.418 --> 44:34.545
Freddy, as a younger man,

44:34.713 --> 44:38.257
I was a sculptor, a
painter and a musician.

44:39.635 --> 44:41.344
There was just one problem.

44:42.221 --> 44:44.180
I wasn't very good.

44:44.348 --> 44:46.432
As a matter of fact, I was dreadful.

44:47.935 --> 44:50.520
I finally came to the
frustrating conclusion

44:50.688 --> 44:53.940
that I had taste and
style, but not talent.

44:54.108 --> 44:55.942
I knew my limitations.

44:57.569 --> 45:00.071
We all have our limitations, Freddy.

45:00.239 --> 45:03.449
Fortunately, I discovered
that taste and style

45:03.617 --> 45:06.327
were commodities that people desired.

45:06.495 --> 45:11.290
Freddy, what I'm saying
is... know your limitations.

45:11.458 --> 45:12.625
You are a moron.

45:13.419 --> 45:16.879
You've been trying to get me out
of this town ever since I came here.

45:17.965 --> 45:20.299
I'll tell you what. We'll make a bet.

45:20.467 --> 45:22.176
If I lose, I'll leave.

45:22.970 --> 45:25.972
If I win... you leave.

45:26.640 --> 45:29.809
All right, Freddy, suppose we try this.

45:30.686 --> 45:33.312
We find a woman, set a price,

45:33.480 --> 45:37.483
and the first man to extract
the correct amount from her wins.

45:38.277 --> 45:39.819
But if you...

45:41.989 --> 45:45.992
But if you lose, you not
only leave town graciously,

45:46.160 --> 45:49.036
you promise never to come
back to Beaumont-sur-Mer again.

45:49.913 --> 45:51.956
Done. Who's the woman?

45:52.124 --> 45:55.084
- (woman) Ooh!
- (clattering)

45:55.252 --> 45:57.754
(dogs yapping)

46:10.601 --> 46:12.602
- Charles!
- Yes, monsieur?

46:12.770 --> 46:15.855
- Who is that?
- Miss Janet Colgate, monsieur.

46:16.023 --> 46:17.523
Who is she?

46:17.691 --> 46:21.110
I believe she is the
United States Soap Queen.

46:21.278 --> 46:22.445
Thank you, Charles.

46:28.577 --> 46:32.955
- OK, how much?
- She's a little young, isn't she?

46:33.123 --> 46:34.791
Out of your league?

46:44.843 --> 46:47.804
All right. I'll make it
easy for you. $50,000.

46:47.971 --> 46:49.180
$50,000?!

46:51.058 --> 46:52.809
Out of your league?

46:54.895 --> 46:58.064
All right. I could use $50,000.

46:58.982 --> 47:01.067
First one to get 50,000 out of her.

47:01.568 --> 47:03.027
May the best man win.

47:04.279 --> 47:05.822
Thank you.

47:44.111 --> 47:46.195
She is at the roulette table,

47:46.363 --> 47:48.865
just waiting for Your Highness.

47:49.908 --> 47:51.117
And Freddy?

47:51.910 --> 47:53.744
He has dropped from sight.

47:54.329 --> 47:58.082
Perhaps the Jackal finally realizes
he is no match for the lion, huh?

47:58.792 --> 48:02.295
Keep your eyes open,
Andre. He'll turn up.

48:17.644 --> 48:20.104
<i>Mesdames, Messieurs, faites vos jeuÑ….</i>

48:29.489 --> 48:31.157
<i>Rien ne va plus. TerminÃ©.</i>

48:47.841 --> 48:48.841
<i>Merci.</i>

48:55.015 --> 48:56.265
<i>Les jeuÑ…, messieurs.</i>

49:13.992 --> 49:15.368
(croupier) 33!

49:20.749 --> 49:22.375
<i>400 francs.</i>

49:22.542 --> 49:24.710
<i>Voila, monsieur, 200 francs.</i>

49:25.837 --> 49:29.090
- (Freddy) Excuse me. Excuse me!
- (woman gasps)

49:30.008 --> 49:32.551
- (woman) Ohh!
- (Freddy) Sorry, ma'am. Excuse me!

49:32.719 --> 49:34.720
- (woman gasps)
- (Freddy) Oh, I'm sorry.

49:37.724 --> 49:39.100
I'm sorry.

49:42.688 --> 49:44.105
Pardon me.

49:46.775 --> 49:48.067
Hi.

49:52.280 --> 49:53.489
Thank you.

49:55.492 --> 49:58.411
Sorry. Excuse me.

49:59.663 --> 50:00.913
Thank you.

50:10.173 --> 50:13.676
Pardon me, miss. Would you
mind placing the bet for me?

50:14.428 --> 50:17.221
It's terribly difficult
for me to reach the table.

50:17.389 --> 50:19.432
Sure. What number would you like?

50:21.476 --> 50:23.769
The way my luck's been running...

50:24.563 --> 50:26.439
Would you pick a number for me?

50:28.650 --> 50:30.776
I could use all the luck I can get.

50:46.293 --> 50:47.626
(Janet) Oh.

50:56.636 --> 51:01.015
Miss? Would you ask the gentleman if he
could advance me a few dollars on this?

51:01.767 --> 51:04.018
(croupier) I'm sorry,
I cannot, monsieur.

51:04.186 --> 51:05.978
That's fine. Thank you.

51:13.070 --> 51:14.862
(Freddy whimpers)

51:24.164 --> 51:27.083
- Excuse me.
- (croupier) Monsieur wins again.

51:33.465 --> 51:36.258
Listen, maybe I can help you.

51:37.010 --> 51:38.677
It's just that that was my last chance.

51:38.845 --> 51:42.389
- Your last chance for what?
- My last chance for an operation.

51:43.642 --> 51:46.602
Well, shouldn't the Navy
pay for your operation?

51:47.687 --> 51:48.813
(laughs)

51:48.980 --> 51:52.233
It's not for me. It's
for my grandmother.

51:53.443 --> 51:57.196
I just got word from the hospital
that she's in pretty bad shape

51:57.364 --> 52:01.575
and if they don't
operate soon, she might...

52:02.994 --> 52:04.995
I'm sorry. I don't even know you

52:05.163 --> 52:07.873
and here I am, bothering
you with my problems.

52:08.041 --> 52:10.709
Oh, please don't feel that way.

52:11.503 --> 52:13.712
Why don't you just
tell me what they are?

52:19.761 --> 52:22.346
Just one stroke of
bad luck after another.

52:23.098 --> 52:25.266
Andre, come with me.

52:38.029 --> 52:39.738
10,000 francs.

52:40.448 --> 52:42.324
That's almost $2,000.

52:44.744 --> 52:46.537
I don't know how to thank you.

52:49.541 --> 52:50.916
But I want you to know...

52:52.085 --> 52:55.379
...that you have saved the
life of a wonderful person.

52:55.964 --> 52:58.924
You are a wonderful person. Thank you.

53:00.302 --> 53:01.760
You're welcome.

53:05.807 --> 53:09.768
Freddy... would an operation help you?

53:10.812 --> 53:13.606
No. My problem isn't physical.

53:14.232 --> 53:15.900
- It's emotional.
- Really?

53:17.527 --> 53:19.612
I'm on six weeks' MTL.

53:20.947 --> 53:22.990
Mental trauma leave.

53:23.992 --> 53:26.410
- What happened?
- Well...

53:26.578 --> 53:29.455
I was engaged to a
girl back in the States.

53:31.082 --> 53:32.666
And we loved to dance.

53:33.919 --> 53:36.962
We wanted to be professionals.
Isn't that silly?

53:38.924 --> 53:42.885
And we got an opportunity to
perform on TV, on Dance USA.

53:44.137 --> 53:48.140
And we decided that if
we won, we'd get married.

53:48.850 --> 53:53.479
So, we went on and
we danced, and we won!

53:53.647 --> 53:55.356
Oh, great!

53:56.274 --> 54:00.194
And in the excitement...
we got separated.

54:01.655 --> 54:03.739
So I went back to the studio...

54:05.825 --> 54:07.451
...and there they were...

54:08.703 --> 54:10.287
...naked...

54:11.164 --> 54:12.665
...dancing.

54:14.668 --> 54:16.335
And then they stopped...

54:17.295 --> 54:20.965
...and they made love, right
there on the dance floor.

54:22.592 --> 54:24.176
Who was she with?

54:29.224 --> 54:32.768
Deney Terrio, the host of Dance USA.

54:34.980 --> 54:36.313
I'm sorry.

54:41.152 --> 54:45.864
In the morning, I woke up
and my legs were useless.

54:47.158 --> 54:50.244
- Numb.
- Oh, my God.

54:50.412 --> 54:53.163
- I couldn't walk.
- Oh, my God.

54:55.333 --> 54:56.959
(slurps)

54:58.169 --> 55:02.631
- Well, surely someone can help you?
- Oh, yeah. There is, but...

55:02.799 --> 55:03.882
What?

55:05.719 --> 55:07.886
There's this psychiatrist,

55:08.054 --> 55:11.307
Doctor Emil Schauffhausen
in Liechtenstein.

55:11.474 --> 55:13.058
Why don't you go to him?

55:14.269 --> 55:17.855
A man like Schauffhausen is
in demand all over the world.

55:18.023 --> 55:20.065
He gets astronomical fees.

55:20.233 --> 55:23.402
It's just not something I can handle.

55:25.113 --> 55:27.573
What do you mean by astronomical?

55:28.700 --> 55:30.492
$50,000.

55:32.579 --> 55:34.621
That is a lot of money.

55:36.416 --> 55:39.501
(piano)

55:44.341 --> 55:47.760
- Freddy, are you OK?
- Oh, God.

55:48.636 --> 55:52.765
They're dancing. They're dancing!

55:54.934 --> 55:57.269
Freddy, we are going
up to my room right now

55:57.437 --> 55:58.937
and write to Dr. Schauffhausen.

55:59.105 --> 56:02.149
- Oh, God! They're
dancing! - Ssh-ssh-ssh.

56:02.317 --> 56:04.234
Oh, take me from this place!

56:04.402 --> 56:06.653
Oh, God!

56:06.821 --> 56:09.323
(Freddy sobs)

56:25.507 --> 56:29.093
I wish you hadn't written
these things about me.

56:29.260 --> 56:31.887
- You make me sound like a hero.
- They're true, aren't they?

56:33.390 --> 56:36.392
Yes. Still, you shouldn't
have promised him the money.

56:36.559 --> 56:38.477
Where am I gonna get $50,000?

56:38.645 --> 56:42.856
You leave that to me, Freddy. When the
time comes, I promise, you'll have it.

56:43.024 --> 56:46.110
I'm going downstairs to mail this
letter and I'll be right back.

56:46.277 --> 56:47.653
Janet.

56:49.614 --> 56:50.989
Thank you.

56:59.707 --> 57:02.501
Number one! Number one!
Number one! Number one!

57:10.176 --> 57:12.010
Dr. Schauffhausen!

57:12.512 --> 57:14.513
Dr. Emil Schauffhausen!

57:17.475 --> 57:19.268
Dr. Schauffhausen!

57:20.228 --> 57:22.104
Dr. Emil Schauffhausen!

57:31.156 --> 57:32.364
(gasps)

57:32.532 --> 57:35.200
Hello again! (laughs)

57:35.368 --> 57:37.119
Are you Dr. Schauffhausen?

57:38.872 --> 57:43.917
<i>- Yes, FrÃ¤ulein.
- What a coincidence! This is a miracle!</i>

57:44.711 --> 57:47.754
I just wrote you a letter about
someone who needs your help.

57:47.922 --> 57:52.384
(German accent) Good. I look forward to
reading it when I get back to my clinic.

57:54.721 --> 57:56.722
<i>- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Uh, what?</i>

57:57.682 --> 57:59.641
Goodbye. (laughs)

58:04.856 --> 58:07.441
Could I just talk to you
for a minute, right now?

58:07.609 --> 58:10.068
Please. I am on my vacation.

58:10.236 --> 58:13.280
It's about an American
Naval Officer, Fred Benson.

58:13.448 --> 58:16.241
You saw him. He was next to
you at the roulette table.

58:16.409 --> 58:19.369
- Benson. Benson.
- In the wheelchair?

58:20.330 --> 58:22.748
Is he the one who wrote
me all those letters?

58:22.916 --> 58:27.211
Something about his fiancÃ©e
running off with a, uh... dancer.

58:27.378 --> 58:30.172
That's the one! And he's
right here in the hotel.

58:30.340 --> 58:33.592
I hate to disturb you while
you're on vacation, doctor,

58:33.760 --> 58:36.887
but could I just get you
to take a look at him?

58:37.055 --> 58:39.431
I'm sorry, FrÃ¤u... What is your name?

58:39.599 --> 58:42.434
- Janet Colgate.
- Janet. Oh.

58:42.602 --> 58:47.648
I am sorry, Janet, but if I see your
friend Benson, I have to see everyone.

58:48.525 --> 58:50.817
I must draw the line somewhere.

58:54.280 --> 58:58.408
- But if it's a matter of money, I...
- You haven't given him any money?

58:58.576 --> 59:01.078
Just a bit. For his
grandmother's operation.

59:01.246 --> 59:04.039
- Don't give him any more money.
- Why?

59:04.207 --> 59:05.791
You see...

59:05.959 --> 59:10.128
...his ego has taken one
shattering blow from a woman.

59:10.880 --> 59:16.093
And, if he accepts charity from
a woman, that is another blow.

59:16.261 --> 59:19.680
- It makes my work so much harder.
- Does that mean you'll see him?

59:20.473 --> 59:23.725
- All right. I'll see him.
- That's wonderful!

59:23.893 --> 59:27.479
But remember what I
said. No money for him.

59:27.647 --> 59:33.402
If I do decide to take this case,
you must pay the fee directly to me.

59:33.570 --> 59:35.571
- You understand?
- Absolutely.

59:36.406 --> 59:38.156
All right.

59:39.075 --> 59:41.076
Where is the boy?

59:46.291 --> 59:47.708
(laughter)

59:54.382 --> 59:55.799
(Janet) Freddy!

59:57.719 --> 59:59.511
Freddy!

01:00:01.055 --> 01:00:03.348
Where are you?

01:00:03.516 --> 01:00:06.226
Boy, you can really get lost
in one of these big places.

01:00:06.394 --> 01:00:07.644
(Janet laughs)

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:11.315
I have a wonderful surprise for you.

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.942
- What?
- Cover your eyes.

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:18.864
- You are a nut!
- Go on.

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:20.449
(giggles)

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:25.245
Now, who is the one
person in this world,

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:27.039
outside of your grandmother,

01:00:27.206 --> 01:00:29.916
that you would like most
to see at this moment?

01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:36.214
- I give up! Who?
- Dr. Emil Schauffhausen!

01:00:42.555 --> 01:00:44.723
At last we meet, Officer Benson.

01:00:45.558 --> 01:00:48.435
After all those letters,
I feel that I know you.

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:54.733
- He can't believe it's really you!
- Yes, I think that's it.

01:00:55.943 --> 01:00:57.778
I am here to help you, my boy.

01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:01.907
Great!

01:01:06.245 --> 01:01:09.915
Now, let's have a look
at those legs, shall we?

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:13.752
So...

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.838
You are numb from the waist down?

01:01:18.716 --> 01:01:21.176
- Is that correct?
- Yes, sir.

01:01:22.303 --> 01:01:25.389
Completely numb? No feeling whatsoever?

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:27.933
- That's
right. - Mm-hm.

01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:33.939
You won't be feeling Mr.
Piggy, then, will you?

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:36.566
No.

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:42.948
Tell me if you feel this.

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:45.617
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:50.622
- No.
- No?

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.457
(Lawrence sighs)

01:01:57.964 --> 01:02:00.173
We must try something else.

01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:04.261
Something a little more stringent.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:39.713
Now tell me, do you feel this?

01:02:44.051 --> 01:02:45.343
No.

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:52.017
How about...

01:02:53.352 --> 01:02:54.811
...that?

01:02:56.814 --> 01:02:58.607
- Nothing.
- Nothing, hm?

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:02.486
Watch yourself, Janet!
Back a little bit.

01:03:02.653 --> 01:03:04.738
(chuckles) Thank you.

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:10.702
How about... this?!

01:03:13.998 --> 01:03:17.000
(Lawrence) Nothing? Hmm.

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.105
Any feeling there?

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:42.734
No?

01:03:44.737 --> 01:03:46.571
This case intrigues me, Janet.

01:03:46.739 --> 01:03:49.032
I will take Officer Benson as a patient.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.909
Did you hear that, Freddy?

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.831
I am renting a villa in this area.

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:59.376
We will move him in, and I
will really go to work on him.

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:01.253
Oh, thank you, doctor.

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:03.588
Do you really think you
can get him to walk again?

01:04:03.756 --> 01:04:06.925
I will have him running,
jumping, shouting, screaming...

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:11.096
...or my name isn't Doctor
Emil Schauffhausen...

01:04:11.764 --> 01:04:13.098
...the Third.

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:15.016
(chuckles)

01:04:16.435 --> 01:04:18.812
Look, doctor, he's
so happy, he's crying.

01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:07.110
Your Highness!

01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:15.201
Mrs. Reed!

01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:20.916
I didn't recognize you for the
moment. How wonderful to see you.

01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:25.670
- Protector of the Veld.
- What a pleasant surprise.

01:05:26.672 --> 01:05:28.840
How was your mission to Belahavula?

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:31.593
It was a great success, thanks to you.

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:33.720
I feel so proud.

01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:38.350
Mrs. Reed, may I present Lady
Janet. Lady Janet, this is Mrs. Reed.

01:05:38.517 --> 01:05:40.185
- How do you do?
- Hello.

01:05:41.228 --> 01:05:43.563
Your Highness. Your accent.

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:47.025
- I'm traveling incognito.
- Oh, I see.

01:05:47.193 --> 01:05:49.694
(whispers) How are the Freedom Fighters?

01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:52.447
Oh, Lady Janet is one of us.

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:55.951
Oh, wonderful!

01:05:57.078 --> 01:05:58.203
And, uh...

01:05:58.871 --> 01:06:02.207
Oh, this is my royal
adjutant, General Benson.

01:06:03.876 --> 01:06:06.836
- How do you do?
- Charmed.

01:06:07.004 --> 01:06:09.798
- Your High...
- Let's have lunch, Mrs. Reed.

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:13.218
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- I will telephone you.

01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:15.053
(Mrs. Reed) Oh, please!

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:22.227
One of my former patients.

01:06:22.728 --> 01:06:24.771
Unfortunately, incurable.

01:07:05.479 --> 01:07:07.313
Freddy, isn't this beautiful?

01:07:07.481 --> 01:07:09.649
I can't believe this
is really happening.

01:07:09.817 --> 01:07:12.902
He's sacrificing his vacation
and sharing his villa.

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:14.779
This is incredible.

01:07:14.947 --> 01:07:18.241
Arthur, this is Miss Colgate.
She will be staying at the hotel.

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:20.869
But Officer Benson
will be staying with us.

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:23.455
Please don't worry. You
are close to my room.

01:07:23.622 --> 01:07:25.790
I shall keep my eyes
on you night and day.

01:07:26.625 --> 01:07:29.711
May I show you the villa?
It has a fascinating history.

01:07:33.632 --> 01:07:35.216
Welcome to hell.

01:07:37.928 --> 01:07:40.722
This is so beautiful.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:43.641
Janet, we haven't discussed my fee yet.

01:07:43.809 --> 01:07:46.061
It will be $50,000.

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:48.188
Yes, I'll have to call my father.

01:07:48.355 --> 01:07:51.941
I wish I could make it lower, but
the clinic would never allow that.

01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:53.359
Oh, I understand.

01:07:53.527 --> 01:07:55.862
- Let me show you the rest of the villa.
- OK.

01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:59.032
(tires screech)

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:07.165
- What about Freddy?
- Freddy, go to your room.

01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:11.002
I'd like to come upstairs, too.

01:08:12.129 --> 01:08:14.506
Of course you would. Come on!

01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:19.010
- But he can't!
- Yes, he can. It's all in his mind.

01:08:20.595 --> 01:08:24.140
- It seems so cruel.
- Trust me. I'm a doctor.

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:36.152
First, I will show you the music room.

01:08:40.323 --> 01:08:42.867
Oh, my goodness.

01:08:43.035 --> 01:08:45.161
- Isn't this beautiful?
- Mm.

01:08:45.328 --> 01:08:48.038
I love all these old
musical instruments.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:51.209
This music box. This is my favorite.

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:54.379
- Listen.
- (plays tune)

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:57.423
In the old days, people
used to dance to this.

01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.759
Come.

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:09.853
(Freddy whimpers)

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:11.813
Freddy!

01:09:12.731 --> 01:09:16.317
I heard the music... and I
pulled myself up the stairs.

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:19.279
And then I saw you and him...

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:21.738
...dancing!

01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:26.327
The more he sees us dance, the
more he will get used to it.

01:09:26.953 --> 01:09:28.705
Ohhh!

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:31.749
It's awful to see us
like this, isn't it?

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:33.917
Janet, you're right.

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:35.962
(grunts)

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:41.593
- Now he can't see us.
- (Freddy wails)

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.636
- This is terrible.
- No pity.

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:46.764
I know this is difficult,

01:09:46.932 --> 01:09:51.227
but it is only through our
strength that Freddy will find his.

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:57.233
(door handle rattles)

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:11.122
I have a splendid day
planned for Freddy.

01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:15.084
But I need your help for
his therapy to be successful.

01:10:15.252 --> 01:10:17.462
- You will sit here.
- Thank you.

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:19.047
I will sit here...

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:22.217
...and Freddy will sit there.

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:23.885
Uh-huh.

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:27.931
Sir, Officer Benson is not in
his room. I found this on the bed.

01:10:29.642 --> 01:10:30.975
Thank you, Arthur.

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:38.816
What? What does it say?

01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:44.322
"I've lost hope.

01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:47.325
Please see that my
grandmother gets my insurance,

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:49.535
and if my body's washed ashore,

01:10:49.703 --> 01:10:53.498
that my remains are cremated and
tossed over the Suwannee River."

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:55.917
He's gonna drown himself!

01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:59.003
There he is, doctor!

01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:01.923
Sit down. Sit down.

01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:04.175
It's a bluff to gain sympathy.

01:11:10.015 --> 01:11:12.475
Pretend to enjoy
yourself. Laugh out loud.

01:11:12.643 --> 01:11:14.102
(laughs)

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.353
(weak laugh)

01:11:15.521 --> 01:11:17.063
- Louder.
- (laughs)

01:11:17.231 --> 01:11:19.357
(laughter)

01:11:24.405 --> 01:11:26.990
(Lawrence) Would you
like some strawberries?

01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:32.203
(Lawrence) He's looking. Keep laughing.

01:11:33.831 --> 01:11:37.500
(Arthur) Excuse me, sir. The man
is here with your satellite dish.

01:11:37.668 --> 01:11:39.711
(Lawrence) What satellite dish?

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:47.552
I'll be right back.

01:11:49.888 --> 01:11:52.557
(Lawrence) What would I
want with a satellite dish?

01:12:26.925 --> 01:12:28.551
(yells)

01:12:31.263 --> 01:12:32.472
Freddy!

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:35.516
(Freddy) I'm out of control!

01:12:39.396 --> 01:12:42.940
I'm out of control! Oh, my God! Oh!

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:46.736
Oh, no! Oh, no!

01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:49.572
Freddy! Freddy!

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:56.162
(Janet) Freddy! Freddy!

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:02.960
(Janet) Freddy! No!

01:13:05.672 --> 01:13:07.632
Freddy, stop, please!

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:13.388
Janet, don't make me crawl
around you. This sand is too hot.

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:15.723
- Then just stop where you are.
- And then what?

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:20.144
When you're not looking, I will come
down here, and I will do it right!

01:13:20.312 --> 01:13:22.105
Then I'm not going to leave you.

01:13:23.315 --> 01:13:24.982
I'm going to get Dr. Schauffhausen.

01:13:25.984 --> 01:13:28.486
Janet. Janet! Janet!

01:13:29.822 --> 01:13:33.282
Not him. He hates me.
He's trying to torture me.

01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:34.951
He doesn't hate you.

01:13:36.161 --> 01:13:39.956
He may seem strict, but
he's just trying to help you.

01:13:40.124 --> 01:13:41.499
Don't make me go back there.

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:44.460
Can't we just stay here a
little bit longer? Please?

01:13:47.214 --> 01:13:48.339
Well...

01:13:57.015 --> 01:13:58.558
(Lawrence) Mm-hm!

01:14:00.185 --> 01:14:01.853
Just as I thought.

01:14:02.646 --> 01:14:05.398
I'm sorry I was so
depressed this morning.

01:14:06.066 --> 01:14:10.862
It's just that last night,
I had a dream about her.

01:14:11.029 --> 01:14:12.363
Ohh!

01:14:14.366 --> 01:14:15.825
I remember...

01:14:16.952 --> 01:14:18.703
...how I used to stare at her...

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:24.667
...and just sit and
touch her face, like this.

01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:28.421
(laughter)

01:14:28.589 --> 01:14:32.341
- That is so sweet.
- She was the first girl I ever kissed.

01:14:32.509 --> 01:14:33.801
Really?

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:35.887
And now...

01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:41.392
...I will probably never kiss
another girl for the rest of my life.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.395
Freddy, that is ridiculous!

01:14:44.563 --> 01:14:48.149
You are an attractive and
exciting and sensitive man.

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:51.819
I'm sure there are a million
women who would love to kiss you.

01:15:00.704 --> 01:15:02.622
I wanna ask you a question,

01:15:02.789 --> 01:15:04.707
and I want you to be
completely honest with me.

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:06.250
OK.

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:11.088
Am I attractive and exciting to you?

01:15:26.772 --> 01:15:29.190
- (Lawrence) Miss Colgate!
- Ohh!

01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:33.486
May I talk to you, please?

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:37.949
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:15:38.116 --> 01:15:40.117
Janet, I am dropping this case.

01:15:40.285 --> 01:15:43.371
Oh, no, please don't. I know
I shouldn't have done it.

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:45.790
It's just that I felt so sorry for him.

01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:49.460
You heard that awful story about
his girlfriend and the dancer.

01:15:49.628 --> 01:15:52.838
- How did that make you feel?
- It made me physically sick.

01:15:53.006 --> 01:15:56.008
Then please help him!
Please, please, please!

01:15:57.427 --> 01:16:00.805
- All right. I will.
- Thank you.

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:03.641
But, Janet, we must hide our pity.

01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:07.353
You and I must be his role model.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.147
We must enjoy ourselves so much

01:16:10.315 --> 01:16:14.485
that Freddy will want to jump
out of the wheelchair and join us.

01:16:14.653 --> 01:16:17.071
I'll try, Doctor, but it won't be easy.

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:19.490
I will be there to help you.

01:16:27.165 --> 01:16:31.419
(lively pop music)

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:02.408
How much of this can he stand?

01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:05.494
Don't show any pity. Look
happy. Enjoy yourself.

01:17:05.662 --> 01:17:08.039
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Come, come.

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:18.841
Isn't she fabulous? Wouldn't
you like to dance with her?

01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:21.594
What's stopping you?

01:17:21.762 --> 01:17:24.013
Get out of that chair
and dance with the girl!

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.975
OK. If you just want to sit
there and miss all the fun.

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:29.268
(chuckles)

01:17:41.698 --> 01:17:44.492
Oi! Oi, mate!

01:17:46.578 --> 01:17:49.205
- Who's the asshole?
- "Get up and dance" he says.

01:17:49.373 --> 01:17:50.915
I'd like to smack him one.

01:17:54.836 --> 01:17:57.755
(music slows down)

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:09.809
I wouldn't mind so much,
but she used to be my girl.

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:14.897
If I could just get her alone,
I think I could have a chance.

01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:17.733
But he's always around.

01:18:24.157 --> 01:18:28.327
I have another idea. It was
love that put him in that chair.

01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:30.287
Perhaps love could get him out.

01:18:30.997 --> 01:18:33.374
Would you mind if I
gave you a little kiss?

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:37.628
- Well, if you think that it would help.
- Yes, I think it would help.

01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:39.630
- OK.
- Right.

01:19:04.322 --> 01:19:07.158
- That piece of shit!
- What do you reckon?

01:19:08.952 --> 01:19:10.578
Hey! Oi!

01:19:11.663 --> 01:19:15.166
There's a transport plane leaving
for Honduras at one o'clock.

01:19:15.333 --> 01:19:17.668
How'd you like your friend to be on it?

01:19:47.824 --> 01:19:50.701
- Good night, Freddy.
- I'll be right back.

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:52.453
Think happy thoughts.

01:19:59.169 --> 01:20:02.421
Doctor, do you think that
the therapy is working?

01:20:02.589 --> 01:20:05.966
- Yes, I am terribly pleased.
- (laughs) Good!

01:20:07.552 --> 01:20:10.054
I'm sorry about the
delay in paying your fee.

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:11.722
I should have it by tomorrow.

01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:15.059
It took longer than I thought
it would to raise the money.

01:20:16.186 --> 01:20:20.397
- You had to raise the money?
- The cash prize wasn't quite enough,

01:20:20.565 --> 01:20:24.568
so I had my father sell off the car
and the furniture and all the jewelry.

01:20:25.570 --> 01:20:27.947
- What cash prize?
- From the contest.

01:20:28.114 --> 01:20:31.408
You know, I was selected as
the United States Soap Queen.

01:20:31.576 --> 01:20:34.829
That's why I'm on this
all-expense-paid trip to Europe.

01:20:35.288 --> 01:20:38.749
Your father doesn't own the
United States Soap Company?

01:20:41.044 --> 01:20:44.588
No! I just use their laundry detergent.

01:20:45.423 --> 01:20:47.967
You see, I entered their
contest and then I won.

01:20:50.387 --> 01:20:53.764
You barely know Freddy...

01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:56.851
...but you'd sell
everything you owned for him?

01:20:57.018 --> 01:21:01.939
Well, it's not everything. I'm
keeping the mink. Is that wrong?

01:21:02.107 --> 01:21:06.443
Besides, knowing I helped a man like
Freddy be able to live his life again

01:21:06.611 --> 01:21:11.282
is worth more to me than the car
or the furniture or all the jewelry.

01:21:11.449 --> 01:21:14.451
I really couldn't ask for
a better prize than that.

01:21:15.787 --> 01:21:19.915
I never knew that
people like you existed.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.628
You are generous, sincere.

01:21:27.132 --> 01:21:29.216
You are... You are wonderful.

01:21:30.635 --> 01:21:32.011
Thank you.

01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:37.600
Well... good night.

01:21:37.767 --> 01:21:38.976
Good night.

01:21:51.448 --> 01:21:53.073
Freddy, get it into your head.

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:55.576
The bet's off. She hasn't got the money.

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:58.329
It sounds like you're
trying to get out of the bet.

01:21:58.496 --> 01:22:02.625
If you're trying to get out of it,
fine. Then you lose and you leave town.

01:22:02.792 --> 01:22:05.836
- But she has the money.
- Only by selling everything she owns.

01:22:06.004 --> 01:22:07.796
Come on! She's keeping the mink.

01:22:07.964 --> 01:22:11.550
If we take her for everything, she
still ends up with a very nice mink.

01:22:11.718 --> 01:22:14.887
Freddy, the women I deal
with are carefully screened.

01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:17.014
They're wealthy and corrupt.

01:22:17.182 --> 01:22:19.683
I never take advantage of
the poor or the virtuous.

01:22:19.851 --> 01:22:24.313
All right. We'll forget about the
money, but the bet is still on.

01:22:24.481 --> 01:22:27.358
- We'll think up a new bet.
- All right. What is the bet?

01:22:27.525 --> 01:22:30.027
- A completely new bet.
- Yes, well, think of one.

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:34.365
We'll make her the bet.

01:22:35.158 --> 01:22:36.575
What do you mean?

01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:39.828
What do you think I mean?

01:22:39.996 --> 01:22:41.830
First one to get her into bed.

01:22:42.874 --> 01:22:46.210
Don't you ever have an emotion
that originates above the waist?

01:22:46.378 --> 01:22:47.711
No!

01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:51.215
Let me tell you something,
Freddy. This is for certain.

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:54.760
A woman like Janet would never
give herself to a man like you.

01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:00.140
What? What?!

01:23:01.059 --> 01:23:03.060
You actually believe that?

01:23:03.228 --> 01:23:06.063
- I know that, Freddy.
- You wanna bet?

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:09.566
All right, Freddy, I'll bet.
But I'm not competing to win.

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:12.528
I'm just betting that you fail.

01:23:12.696 --> 01:23:15.155
- Loser leaves town.
- Loser leaves town.

01:23:30.588 --> 01:23:33.424
I say. I say!

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:37.720
- What do you want?
- You're blocking my gate.

01:23:37.887 --> 01:23:40.097
See the captain. He's
in the back of the truck.

01:23:40.265 --> 01:23:42.057
Now, look here.

01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:49.815
- This is private property, you know.
- Just see the captain in the back.

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:57.906
Captain? Which one of you is...

01:24:03.997 --> 01:24:07.833
- Will you be all right?
- Oh, yeah. She said she'd meet me here.

01:24:08.835 --> 01:24:10.127
Wish me luck!

01:24:28.772 --> 01:24:32.483
Freddy! I thought Dr.
Schauffhausen took you home?

01:24:32.650 --> 01:24:35.694
Yeah, well, he did. I... couldn't sleep.

01:24:36.571 --> 01:24:38.739
I have to talk to you, Janet.

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:40.282
Well, come in.

01:24:42.869 --> 01:24:45.954
I was thinking about what
Dr. Schauffhausen told me.

01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:49.374
That I could walk again if
the desire was strong enough?

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:52.419
Yes, he told me the same thing.

01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:55.005
Janet...

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:58.842
...I think you're the only person in
the world who can give me that desire.

01:24:59.719 --> 01:25:02.429
Well... what do you mean?

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:09.186
I love you...

01:25:10.063 --> 01:25:13.857
...and I think I could walk again
if I thought you loved me, too.

01:25:14.025 --> 01:25:15.609
Oh, Freddy.

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:19.321
But... I still have this terrible fear.

01:25:19.489 --> 01:25:22.866
- What fear?
- That my feelings won't be returned.

01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:26.787
Oh, but your feelings will be returned,

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:30.124
because I think I love you, too, Freddy.

01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:32.334
And you will walk.

01:25:32.502 --> 01:25:34.962
- Here.
- What are you doing?

01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:39.508
Now, stand up and walk to me.

01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:44.054
- No!
- Come on! You can do it!

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:50.894
- You won't disappoint me?
- No, I won't disappoint you.

01:25:53.523 --> 01:25:57.276
Stand up and walk to me.
Please, Freddy, just try!

01:25:58.444 --> 01:26:00.195
(Janet laughs nervously)

01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:08.579
Come on!

01:26:11.791 --> 01:26:13.750
Come on. Let go!

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:19.506
Oh! Agh! Oh!

01:26:21.301 --> 01:26:22.759
I'm standing.

01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:26.805
I'm standing!

01:26:26.973 --> 01:26:28.849
Yes. Now walk to me!

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:32.811
- You won't let me down?
- No, I won't let you down!

01:26:36.608 --> 01:26:38.859
That's it. That's it.

01:26:39.652 --> 01:26:41.945
Oh, God. You're doing it!

01:26:43.114 --> 01:26:45.115
(laughter)

01:26:46.826 --> 01:26:49.203
- Do you wanna rest?
- No, no, I wanna keep trying.

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:51.371
Go over there. Go stand over there!

01:26:51.539 --> 01:26:53.290
- Here?
- By the bed!

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:55.125
I wanna see just how far I can go!

01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:57.419
- Here?
- (grunts)

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:00.172
- Here?
- Yeah!

01:27:01.466 --> 01:27:03.342
Walk to me!

01:27:03.968 --> 01:27:06.970
- I... I'm still afraid.
- Oh, don't be afraid.

01:27:07.138 --> 01:27:11.058
- Don't you wanna kiss me?
- Yeah!

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:14.811
If you come over here, I
will prove that I love you.

01:27:15.563 --> 01:27:19.608
- You'll prove it?
- Come on. Come on.

01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:24.363
You can do it. Come on. Take a step!

01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:27.282
- That's it! I knew you could do it!
- I'm walking!

01:27:30.828 --> 01:27:34.164
Ah! I made it! I made it!

01:27:34.332 --> 01:27:36.833
Yes, Freddy! You made it!

01:27:37.835 --> 01:27:39.378
And all because...

01:27:40.338 --> 01:27:43.090
...of your... love.

01:27:45.551 --> 01:27:47.678
(Lawrence) Our love, Freddy.

01:27:50.515 --> 01:27:51.974
We all love you.

01:27:57.563 --> 01:28:01.858
It's moments like this that
make being a doctor worthwhile.

01:28:02.026 --> 01:28:03.819
(Janet giggles)

01:28:03.987 --> 01:28:06.405
Oh, no wonder they call you a genius!

01:28:06.572 --> 01:28:08.699
You said he'd come
here tonight and he did!

01:28:08.866 --> 01:28:10.909
You said that he would walk and he did!

01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:15.205
Freddy, I'm beginning to believe
this man can really perform miracles.

01:28:15.373 --> 01:28:16.915
(Lawrence chuckles)

01:28:18.376 --> 01:28:21.044
I'm beginning to believe it, too.

01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:26.967
How the hell did you get off that plane?

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:28.552
I never got on it.

01:28:29.178 --> 01:28:32.389
- There were six sailors in that truck.
- Seven sailors, Freddy.

01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:35.058
I am a Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve.

01:28:37.103 --> 01:28:39.646
You think you got me.
This is just the beginning.

01:28:39.814 --> 01:28:42.107
Now I am really going
to turn on the charm.

01:28:42.275 --> 01:28:43.567
No, you're not, Freddy.

01:28:43.735 --> 01:28:46.611
I am taking her to the
airport in the morning.

01:28:46.779 --> 01:28:47.863
You failed.

01:28:48.031 --> 01:28:51.533
And I'm making sure she gets as
far away from you as possible.

01:28:52.869 --> 01:28:56.288
Oh, yeah? And how do you plan
on getting her to the airport

01:28:56.456 --> 01:28:59.666
without Freddy Benson on you
like glue? What are you doing?

01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:03.587
- (lively music)
- Hey, look who's here!

01:29:04.422 --> 01:29:08.091
Oh, yes. And he can walk, just
like the man said he could.

01:29:08.259 --> 01:29:11.261
Oi, guys! Have a look at this.

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:13.347
Hi!

01:29:13.514 --> 01:29:17.267
Hey, would you take care of
my friend till I get back?

01:29:17.435 --> 01:29:19.102
(cheering)

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:23.023
There's plenty more food
and champagne to come.

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.610
(whistles tune)

01:29:28.279 --> 01:29:31.990
- But couldn't I just call Freddy?
- No. Trust me in this matter.

01:29:32.158 --> 01:29:35.952
But I think that maybe I love him
and that maybe he loves me, I think.

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.871
And now that he's cured...

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:41.750
Then it's even more important for
you to go away for a couple of weeks.

01:29:41.918 --> 01:29:44.378
If a man loves you, he will follow you.

01:29:44.545 --> 01:29:47.714
- But how do I know...
- Trust me this one last time.

01:29:47.882 --> 01:29:49.633
(Janet sighs)

01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:51.301
All right.

01:29:51.469 --> 01:29:53.804
But what about your fee?

01:29:53.971 --> 01:29:56.932
You do what I tell you,
and you can keep the fee.

01:29:57.809 --> 01:29:59.601
- You're kidding!
- Yes.

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:02.270
You're wonderful.

01:30:02.438 --> 01:30:05.482
- Will you tell Freddy I said goodbye?
- Of course.

01:30:05.650 --> 01:30:06.983
Thanks.

01:30:11.155 --> 01:30:12.531
Bye.

01:30:20.832 --> 01:30:22.290
- Hello, mate.
- Hello.

01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:26.503
- Thanks, mate.
- All right.

01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:28.672
Yee-ha!

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:31.174
Did that really happen?
I don't believe that!

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:38.557
Listen, I gotta go. Take care. See ya.

01:30:38.724 --> 01:30:40.350
(laughter)

01:30:40.518 --> 01:30:43.061
- Great guy!
- Bye.

01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:48.066
Well, you seem to be
having a very nice time.

01:30:48.234 --> 01:30:49.651
I had a great time.

01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:53.488
Could you hand me that
superglue solvent, please?

01:30:58.035 --> 01:31:00.537
(Freddy) I was on that
wall for six hours.

01:31:00.705 --> 01:31:02.914
God. Jesus!

01:31:05.334 --> 01:31:07.836
- Well, Freddy, it's over.
- What's over?

01:31:10.047 --> 01:31:13.967
See that plane? There goes your bet.

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:15.677
Janet's on it.

01:31:21.893 --> 01:31:24.936
Have the honor to admit
it, Freddy. You've lost.

01:31:26.022 --> 01:31:28.398
Go and see for yourself. She's gone.

01:31:30.234 --> 01:31:32.527
Have a safe trip and
a prosperous career.

01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:36.072
Auf Wiedersehen. (laughs)

01:31:53.591 --> 01:31:55.091
<i>Merci.</i>

01:31:57.887 --> 01:31:59.304
Janet!

01:32:01.432 --> 01:32:03.433
Janet, it's me, Freddy!

01:32:04.644 --> 01:32:09.564
Janet!

01:32:25.706 --> 01:32:27.123
I lost.

01:32:29.335 --> 01:32:30.794
(Janet) Freddy!

01:32:32.129 --> 01:32:33.463
Freddy!

01:32:34.131 --> 01:32:35.090
(gasps)

01:32:35.258 --> 01:32:38.468
- You're here!
- Hi.

01:32:42.515 --> 01:32:48.103
I know the doctor said it might endanger
your recovery, but I had to see you.

01:32:48.271 --> 01:32:50.564
You see, I really am in love with you.

01:32:50.731 --> 01:32:52.065
Really?

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:55.777
- You actually
love me? - Mm-hm.

01:33:10.167 --> 01:33:13.837
Now that you're walking, do you
think that you can... well...

01:33:15.756 --> 01:33:17.090
I can try.

01:33:18.092 --> 01:33:22.387
You may not believe this, but I
haven't had very much experience.

01:33:23.556 --> 01:33:26.516
- Me either.
- Could you close the drapes?

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:29.728
Sure.

01:33:37.361 --> 01:33:39.738
And... shut the door.

01:33:40.489 --> 01:33:41.698
Yeah.

01:34:02.887 --> 01:34:04.220
(laughs)

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:12.771
It's Andre, sir.

01:34:16.942 --> 01:34:18.151
Thank you.

01:34:20.279 --> 01:34:23.490
<i>- Hello, Andre. What a lovely morning.
- Monsieur Jamieson?</i>

01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:26.618
<i>- Are you lying down?
- What?</i>

01:34:27.411 --> 01:34:30.830
Ms. Colgate was seen
returning to the hotel.

01:34:31.791 --> 01:34:34.751
<i>- But I took her to the plane.
- Then somebody took her off.</i>

01:34:36.212 --> 01:34:40.298
<i>- Where's Freddy?
- The Jackal is with Miss Colgate now.</i>

01:34:40.466 --> 01:34:43.760
<i>They have been together in her
room, with the curtains drawn.</i>

01:34:45.096 --> 01:34:47.931
Oh. And for how long?

01:34:48.099 --> 01:34:52.560
Oh, not long. But long
enough. It is a disaster.

01:34:54.647 --> 01:34:58.274
It seems the teacher has
underestimated the student.

01:34:59.735 --> 01:35:02.362
<i>We must accept defeat graciously.</i>

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:05.323
Now, I will prepare
myself for the Jackal.

01:35:05.491 --> 01:35:08.284
I'm sure he'll be over here
soon to gloat over his victory.

01:35:09.787 --> 01:35:11.204
Thank you, my old friend.

01:35:15.167 --> 01:35:17.627
(doorbell rings)

01:35:43.487 --> 01:35:46.030
- Janet!
- (sobs)

01:35:46.949 --> 01:35:49.367
Janet. What is the matter?

01:35:50.327 --> 01:35:53.788
I know what you said, but
I just had to see him again.

01:35:53.956 --> 01:35:56.458
You see, I... I thought
I was in love with him.

01:35:56.625 --> 01:35:59.335
- What?
- I went back to see him and...

01:35:59.962 --> 01:36:02.172
- And?
- And...

01:36:03.674 --> 01:36:05.717
We made love and...

01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:11.681
I tried to please him,
but how could I have known?

01:36:12.975 --> 01:36:15.935
And then what happened
was I fell asleep,

01:36:16.103 --> 01:36:18.188
and when I woke up, he was gone.

01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:24.360
He took all my money. My mink,
my jewelry, my traveler's checks.

01:36:24.528 --> 01:36:27.071
Even my little change purse.

01:36:29.366 --> 01:36:32.202
What kind of a man would
do something like that?

01:36:32.369 --> 01:36:34.162
And do you know what else?

01:36:34.330 --> 01:36:36.456
I'm beginning to think
that he could walk.

01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:39.959
That he pretended this whole thing
just to get to me and my money.

01:36:40.127 --> 01:36:43.713
It was all my savings, the
prize money. Everything.

01:36:43.881 --> 01:36:46.257
$50,000!

01:36:47.218 --> 01:36:49.928
Janet, I told you I'd waive my fee.

01:36:50.095 --> 01:36:52.806
It had already gotten
here. I had it in my purse.

01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:56.267
What am I gonna say to my
father? Some of the money was his.

01:37:00.898 --> 01:37:02.357
Arthur!

01:37:04.819 --> 01:37:05.985
Yes, sir?

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:10.323
I want you to phone Andre and
tell him to find Officer Benson.

01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:13.618
It seems he has stolen some
of Miss Colgate's property.

01:37:13.786 --> 01:37:15.537
I shall be at the airport.

01:37:16.413 --> 01:37:19.749
Janet, I am going to cover your losses.

01:37:19.917 --> 01:37:22.585
You and your father will
get your $50,000 back,

01:37:22.753 --> 01:37:25.255
and I am putting you on
the first plane out of here.

01:37:25.422 --> 01:37:27.757
And this time, I will
make sure you are on it.

01:37:27.925 --> 01:37:31.135
But you're not responsible.
How could you have known?

01:37:31.303 --> 01:37:34.430
Any good psychiatrist would
have known he was a charlatan.

01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:38.434
Come. In any case, it's
cheaper than a malpractice suit,

01:37:38.602 --> 01:37:40.353
which I am sure you would win.

01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:44.649
- I can't take your money.
- You can, and you will. Take it.

01:37:55.661 --> 01:37:57.620
Janet, come on.

01:37:59.039 --> 01:38:01.416
- You change planes in Paris.
- OK.

01:38:02.126 --> 01:38:04.460
I don't feel good
about taking your money.

01:38:04.628 --> 01:38:06.379
I feel good about it.

01:38:06.547 --> 01:38:09.799
It has been so great to meet you, I...

01:38:11.802 --> 01:38:14.387
If you're ever in
Cleveland, will you call me?

01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:16.097
I will.

01:38:20.269 --> 01:38:23.646
Goodbye.

01:38:26.817 --> 01:38:28.318
Janet!

01:38:30.321 --> 01:38:31.696
Have a good flight.

01:38:32.781 --> 01:38:34.073
Thank you!

01:38:52.384 --> 01:38:55.678
I can't take this. It
doesn't belong to me.

01:38:55.846 --> 01:38:59.807
And I'll always have something
from you that means much more!

01:38:59.975 --> 01:39:05.271
Bye!

01:39:09.818 --> 01:39:11.361
Goodbye!

01:39:15.699 --> 01:39:18.034
(siren)

01:39:27.753 --> 01:39:31.589
Monsieur Jamieson! I caught him at
the hotel, at the scene of the crime.

01:39:31.757 --> 01:39:33.883
What crime? What is
this guy talking about?

01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:37.762
Listen, Freddy. This time,
she really is on that plane.

01:39:38.555 --> 01:39:42.225
- And you can't harm her again.
- You let her go? You gotta stop her!

01:39:42.393 --> 01:39:43.768
(Freddy) Hey! Hey!

01:39:45.062 --> 01:39:48.690
Hey! Hey! Hold it! Hold it!

01:39:48.857 --> 01:39:51.985
Come back! Hey, hey, hey!

01:39:52.152 --> 01:39:53.569
Hold it!

01:39:55.698 --> 01:39:58.157
You idiot! You let her go!

01:39:58.325 --> 01:40:01.411
You slept with her, but you
didn't have to steal her money.

01:40:01.578 --> 01:40:04.539
Steal her money? I
didn't! She stole from me.

01:40:04.707 --> 01:40:08.251
I'm about to win the bet and she says
"Close the drapes." I close the drapes.

01:40:08.419 --> 01:40:10.336
"Close the door." So I close the door.

01:40:10.504 --> 01:40:12.046
Then she says, "Would
you mind taking a shower?"

01:40:12.214 --> 01:40:13.673
So, "OK, I'll take a shower."

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:17.510
When I come out, she's gone. My
clothes, my wallet and my watch are gone.

01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:19.762
She even took the 2,000
francs she gave me!

01:40:19.930 --> 01:40:23.558
Do you expect me to believe that when
she's returned the $50,000 I gave her?

01:40:23.726 --> 01:40:27.520
- What $50,000?
- The $50,000 you stole from her.

01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:30.106
I didn't steal $50,000 from her!

01:40:43.203 --> 01:40:45.204
Hey, there's my clothes.

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:55.965
"Hello, boys. It was fun."

01:40:56.133 --> 01:41:01.179
"I'll miss you. Love,
Janet. The Jackal."

01:41:01.346 --> 01:41:05.099
"PS. I'm keeping the
money. Is that wrong?"

01:41:13.484 --> 01:41:16.194
Of all the lousy...

01:41:16.361 --> 01:41:18.696
She is disgusting!

01:41:18.864 --> 01:41:21.616
She is lying! She is
deceitful! She is two-faced!

01:41:21.784 --> 01:41:25.161
She is conniving and she is dishonest!

01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:30.208
Yes.

01:41:30.375 --> 01:41:32.877
Isn't she wonderful?

01:42:05.702 --> 01:42:07.036
Arthur.

01:42:08.831 --> 01:42:12.208
I'm sorry I broke your VHS
player. Give me the model number.

01:42:12.376 --> 01:42:14.210
When I'm settled, I'll send you a check.

01:42:14.378 --> 01:42:15.711
Oh, shut up.

01:42:35.107 --> 01:42:38.109
(Freddy) Well, thanks for
letting me stay the extra week.

01:42:44.491 --> 01:42:46.742
I kind of had it figured
from the beginning.

01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:49.370
"J," Janet. "J," Jackal.

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:52.039
If you think about it, it's obvious.

01:43:03.468 --> 01:43:05.303
When do you think she was onto us?

01:43:06.597 --> 01:43:08.764
(Lawrence) From the beginning, Freddy.

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:11.893
She was onto us from the very beginning.

01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:14.478
She was perfect.

01:43:22.654 --> 01:43:25.615
(Freddy) So, uh... what
are you gonna do now?

01:43:27.451 --> 01:43:31.329
Well, things are going to
be quiet around here now.

01:43:33.081 --> 01:43:34.457
The season's over.

01:43:35.876 --> 01:43:37.418
Autumn's coming.

01:43:39.004 --> 01:43:41.172
I'll be shutting up part of the house.

01:43:49.806 --> 01:43:51.015
Well...

01:43:52.309 --> 01:43:53.643
...goodbye.

01:43:55.812 --> 01:43:57.188
Goodbye, Freddy.

01:43:57.356 --> 01:43:59.815
(chattering)

01:44:07.491 --> 01:44:11.118
(woman) Wait a minute, everybody.
Wait a minute! Can you hang on?

01:44:11.286 --> 01:44:13.829
Hold it, hold it, hold
it! Excuse me, hold it!

01:44:13.997 --> 01:44:16.624
Excuse me! Excuse me.

01:44:17.251 --> 01:44:20.169
Hello there, my darlings. There you are!

01:44:20.337 --> 01:44:22.797
God, are you kidding
me with this gravel?

01:44:22.965 --> 01:44:24.924
These heels weren't made for this.

01:44:25.092 --> 01:44:29.220
Hey! Hello! We made it. Could
youse get the bags up here pronto?

01:44:29.388 --> 01:44:30.930
Yeah, thank you.

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:35.393
Now, first, intros.

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:38.729
Nikos. Nikos, get over here.

01:44:39.898 --> 01:44:42.692
- Nikos, come here!
- All right, Paula.

01:44:42.859 --> 01:44:46.404
Come on, everybody. I want you
to meet Mr. Big Stuff. (laughs)

01:44:46.571 --> 01:44:48.406
I was showing Nikos property in Florida.

01:44:48.573 --> 01:44:52.618
He goes "I wanna invest my 16
million bucks someplace new."

01:44:52.786 --> 01:44:55.579
I say "Where?" He goes
"How about Australia?"

01:44:55.747 --> 01:44:58.833
And then it hits me. Boom!
Australia, are you kidding me?

01:44:59.001 --> 01:45:01.627
We gotta go meet Mr. Australia himself!

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:03.546
He goes "Why not?" I go "Why not?"

01:45:03.714 --> 01:45:06.549
- Pretty soon, the whole group goes...
- (all) "Why not?"

01:45:07.467 --> 01:45:08.634
So here we are.

01:45:08.802 --> 01:45:11.637
So, Nikos Papandropolous,

01:45:11.805 --> 01:45:15.224
I'd like you to meet the
favorite son of Australia,

01:45:15.392 --> 01:45:16.851
Chips O'Toole.

01:45:30.073 --> 01:45:32.241
Well, aren't you gonna say anything?

01:45:35.162 --> 01:45:36.620
(Australian accent) G'day, Nikos.

01:45:36.788 --> 01:45:40.541
How's it goin', sport?
Good on ya, cobber.

01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:44.420
Chips O'Toole. Hotels
and oil from down under.

01:45:44.588 --> 01:45:48.174
Do you still have any
situations available in Sydney?

01:45:48.342 --> 01:45:49.759
No, it's all gone, Paula.

01:45:49.926 --> 01:45:52.595
Never mind, Nikos. People
drop out, don't they?

01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:55.014
Anyway, come on up to the house.

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:57.600
We'll put some shrimps
on the barbie for ya.

01:45:58.226 --> 01:46:00.269
Hey, I almost forgot somebody!

01:46:00.437 --> 01:46:04.940
Mr. Junior Partner. The
man Chips can't do without.

01:46:05.108 --> 01:46:08.569
The whiz kid. Randy Bentwick.

01:46:09.446 --> 01:46:11.614
Unfortunately, Randy is a mute.

01:46:13.283 --> 01:46:16.118
All right, everybody get on
up to the house for a drink.

01:46:17.496 --> 01:46:19.830
You wanna refresh those
cocktails, don't you?

01:46:20.874 --> 01:46:22.625
The ice is melting. Hurry, hurry.

01:46:22.793 --> 01:46:25.795
Go on up! Follow the
path around the house.

01:46:25.962 --> 01:46:28.089
Keep going! That's it, keep going!

01:46:29.049 --> 01:46:30.716
I'll be right up there.

01:46:38.141 --> 01:46:42.645
Fellas, last year I made $3 million.

01:46:42.813 --> 01:46:45.648
But your 50,000 was the most fun.

01:46:47.651 --> 01:46:49.193
Are you ready?

01:46:50.862 --> 01:46:52.613
Then let's go get 'em.
