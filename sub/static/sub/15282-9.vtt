10:10.601 --> 10:12.601
LEADING SOMEONE
TO BE ANTAGONISTIC?

10:12.667 --> 10:14.200
SHE STANDS OUT. SINGLE WOMAN.

10:14.267 --> 10:16.033
COULD BE SOMEONE WAS
WATCHING HER FOR A WHILE.

10:16.100 --> 10:18.234
THE SADIST WHO GETS OFF
ON GAINING HER TRUST

10:18.300 --> 10:19.834
AND THEN TRYING
TO KILL HER?

10:19.901 --> 10:21.868
PRETTY COMMON.
KEMPER, BUNDY,
ROBERT ANDERSON--

10:21.934 --> 10:24.067
THEY ALL HAD
AN ELEMENT OF IT.

10:25.133 --> 10:26.501
WHAT'S BUGGING YOU?

10:26.567 --> 10:30.934
A SADIST WHO JUST HAPPENS TO
CHOOSE AN ANALYST FOR THE FBI?

10:40.467 --> 10:42.767
[MONITOR BEEPING]

10:42.834 --> 10:44.934
I ASKED HER
TO GO OUT LAST NIGHT.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.133
BUT SHE WAS PISSED AT ME.

10:48.467 --> 10:50.501
SHE BLEW ME OFF.

10:53.968 --> 10:56.000
SO YOU ENDED UP
IN CHURCH?

10:56.067 --> 10:57.067
YEAH.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.000
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

11:02.667 --> 11:04.434
ONE ONE HAND,
IF SHE'D GONE OUT WITH ME,

11:04.501 --> 11:06.534
SHE WOULD HAVE NEVER GOT SHOT.

11:06.601 --> 11:08.868
ON THE OTHER HAND...

11:08.934 --> 11:11.701
WHAT ARE THE ODDS
THAT THE FIRST TIME
I PRAY IN 20 YEARS,

11:11.767 --> 11:13.200
SHE'S ON THE TABLE?

11:13.267 --> 11:15.834
SHE'S ASKING FOR YOU.

11:26.801 --> 11:28.767
HEY.

11:28.834 --> 11:30.734
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

11:30.801 --> 11:33.901
GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS.

11:33.968 --> 11:36.300
THE MORPHINE'S WEARING OFF.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.734
WHEN I WAS IN THE AMBULANCE,

11:42.801 --> 11:45.834
I COULD HEAR
THE SONG HEROES

11:45.901 --> 11:47.801
PLAYING IN MY HEAD.

11:49.367 --> 11:53.801
I KEPT FLASHING IN AND OUT
OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

11:53.868 --> 11:56.234
EVERYTHING
WAS REALLY BRIGHT.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.834
AND I REMEMBER THINKING,

11:57.901 --> 11:59.267
WAIT...

11:59.334 --> 12:01.467
IS DAVID BOWIE REALLY GOD?

12:05.167 --> 12:07.000
WE HAVE A, UH...

12:07.067 --> 12:10.601
WE HAVE A SKETCH ARTIST
COMING IN.

12:10.667 --> 12:12.534
OK.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.501
I'M STILL A LITTLE HAZY.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.000
IT'S OK.

12:17.067 --> 12:18.834
ANYTHING YOU TELL US
WILL HELP.

12:18.901 --> 12:20.601
YEAH.

12:22.434 --> 12:24.234
THIS GUY SAY WHAT HE DID
FOR A LIVING?

12:25.968 --> 12:28.167
HE SAID HE WAS A LAWYER.

12:28.234 --> 12:31.734
DID...DID PEOPLE KNOW HIM
WHERE YOU WENT?

12:31.801 --> 12:35.200
HE SAID HE WANTED
TO SHOW ME A PLACE.

12:35.267 --> 12:38.133
IT WAS HALF AN HOUR AWAY.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.400
YOU DROVE TOGETHER?

12:39.467 --> 12:41.334
MM.
WHAT KIND OF CAR?

12:41.400 --> 12:43.834
WHITE.

12:43.901 --> 12:45.734
4-DOOR SEDAN.

12:45.801 --> 12:47.634
AMERICAN.

12:47.701 --> 12:49.167
IT SMELLED NEW.

12:49.234 --> 12:51.634
RENTAL CAR MAYBE?

12:51.701 --> 12:52.801
MAYBE.

12:52.868 --> 12:54.067
I DON'T KNOW.

12:54.133 --> 12:56.234
I DON'T LOOK AT THINGS
LIKE YOU GUYS DO.

12:56.300 --> 12:57.567
I DON'T SEE DANGER--

12:57.634 --> 12:58.801
OK. TAKE IT EASY.

12:58.868 --> 13:01.467
TAKE IT EASY.

13:01.534 --> 13:03.467
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU REMEMBER?

13:05.100 --> 13:07.434
HE SMELLED GOOD.

13:07.501 --> 13:08.667
GOOD NIGHT.

13:08.734 --> 13:10.400
GOOD NIGHT.

13:10.467 --> 13:12.234
Reid: HE SEEM NERVOUS?

13:12.300 --> 13:16.634
I THOUGHT HE WAS JUST AFRAID
TO KISS ME GOOD NIGHT.

13:18.267 --> 13:19.701
HEY.

13:19.767 --> 13:21.667
YOU SURE
YOU'RE UP FOR THIS?

13:26.133 --> 13:27.267
HEY, GARCIA.

13:27.334 --> 13:28.534
YEAH.

13:28.601 --> 13:30.501
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT DOING THIS ALL NIGHT.

13:35.067 --> 13:38.167
I COULD HEAR HIM WALKING.

13:39.734 --> 13:41.968
HE LEANED OVER ME
AND I HELD MY BREATH

13:42.033 --> 13:43.567
SO HE'D THINK
I WAS DEAD.

13:50.968 --> 13:52.734
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

13:52.801 --> 13:54.234
A SHOOTING.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.868
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

13:55.934 --> 13:57.300
SHE'S IN INTENSIVE CARE.

13:57.367 --> 13:59.534
SHE SURVIVED?

13:59.601 --> 14:02.834
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW.

14:02.901 --> 14:04.234
MIRACLES OF SCIENCE, RIGHT?

14:04.300 --> 14:05.868
YEAH.

14:05.934 --> 14:08.968
THEY GET THE GUY?

14:09.033 --> 14:10.334
NO CLUE AT ALL?

14:10.400 --> 14:12.000
PROBABLY SOME CRACKHEAD.

14:12.067 --> 14:13.367
IT'S CRAZY.

14:13.434 --> 14:16.200
POLICE AROUND HERE
CAN'T EVEN KEEP YOU SAFE.

14:16.267 --> 14:19.200
THIS WHOLE CITY'S
GOING TO HELL.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.100
YOU LOOK LIKE CRAP.

14:39.167 --> 14:41.434
WELL, 4 DAYS, NO LEADS,
I FEEL LIKE CRAP.

14:41.501 --> 14:43.100
ANY WORD
FROM THE HOSPITAL?

14:43.167 --> 14:45.701
SHE'S OUT OF THE ICU.
DOCTOR SAID SHE COULD GO HOME
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

14:45.767 --> 14:47.367
REID AND MORGAN
ARE REPLAYING IT WITH HER

14:47.434 --> 14:49.033
AND THEY'LL
KEEP US POSTED.

14:49.100 --> 14:51.133
WE CAN ALWAYS ROUND UP
THE 3 MILLION GUYS

14:51.200 --> 14:52.634
THE SKETCH LOOKS LIKE.

14:52.701 --> 14:54.133
THAT WAS THE POLICE.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.868
THEY TOOK THE SKETCH
BACK TO THE COFFEE SHOP,

14:55.934 --> 14:58.367
RESTAURANT,
CAME UP EMPTY.

14:58.434 --> 14:59.534
I EVEN RAN IT
THROUGH VICAP.

14:59.601 --> 15:00.534
NO HITS.

15:00.601 --> 15:02.100
NO LUCK WITH
THE RENTAL CAR COMPANIES.

15:02.167 --> 15:03.934
NO PRINTS AT THE SCENE.
NO SHELL CASINGS.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.267
THE CELL PHONE THE GUY USED
TO CALL GARCIA AT WORK

15:06.334 --> 15:07.834
WAS A DISPOSABLE.

15:07.901 --> 15:09.634
THE GUY'S A CIPHER.

15:14.767 --> 15:16.567
HYPERVIGILANCE, RIGHT?

15:16.634 --> 15:18.367
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

15:18.434 --> 15:20.267
YOU KNOW, MOST PEOPLE
THESE DAYS ARE LOOKING

15:20.334 --> 15:22.267
FOR A SEMI-AUTOMATIC.
YEAH?

15:22.334 --> 15:24.467
YEAH. HOLDS MORE ROUNDS.

15:24.534 --> 15:28.200
YOU DON'T NEED MORE ROUNDS
IF YOU DON'T MISS.

15:30.667 --> 15:33.133
PENELOPE, I KNOW
IT'S GOTTA BE HARD
TO KEEP RELIVING THIS.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.133
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
THERE IS TO REMEMBER.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.968
LET'S START
WITH THE BEHAVIOR.

15:37.033 --> 15:41.934
THAT'S ALL--THAT'S ALL
PROFILING REALLY IS,
JUST NOTICING BEHAVIOR.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.300
SWEETHEART, ANY DETAILS
YOU CAN REMEMBER
WILL TELL US WHO HE IS.

15:46.367 --> 15:48.100
OK?
MM-HMM.

15:48.167 --> 15:51.367
ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S GO BACK
TO WHEN YOU FIRST ARRIVED
AT THAT RESTAURANT.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.901
WAS HE NERVOUS?

15:54.968 --> 15:56.000
NO.

15:56.067 --> 15:58.767
THE OPPOSITE, ACTUALLY.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.767
Waiter: CAN I START YOU
WITH ANYTHING TO DRINK?

16:00.834 --> 16:03.133
WE'LL HAVE A BOTTLE
OF SANCERRE.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.968
ACTUALLY, I DRINK RED.

16:05.033 --> 16:06.133
TRUST ME,

16:06.200 --> 16:07.868
YOU'LL LOVE IT.

16:09.467 --> 16:11.234
SO, HE WAS TRYING
TO IMPRESS YOU

16:11.300 --> 16:13.167
BY SHOWING YOU HOW
HE CAN TAKE CHARGE.

16:13.234 --> 16:15.234
I GUESS SO.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.000
TELL ME ABOUT HIS WATCH.

16:17.067 --> 16:19.200
IT'S A FAKE ROLEX.

16:19.267 --> 16:20.667
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

16:20.734 --> 16:22.567
I KNOW MY KNOCKOFFS.

16:22.634 --> 16:24.300
CLEARLY HE WAS PLAYING
WITH IT, THOUGH,

16:24.367 --> 16:26.000
'CAUSE HE WANTED YOU
TO NOTICE. I MEAN,

16:26.067 --> 16:28.968
HE WANTED YOU TO THINK
THAT IT WAS REAL.

16:29.033 --> 16:30.767
GARCIA, ARE YOU OK?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.267
I'M FEELING REALLY EXPOSED.

16:33.334 --> 16:35.100
YOU'RE DOING JUST FINE.

16:35.167 --> 16:37.334
JUST FINE.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.334
SO YOU WORK
FOR THE FBI.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.100
MM-HMM.
THAT'S GLAMOROUS.

16:41.167 --> 16:44.100
IF YOU WANT TO CALL
14-HOUR DAYS

16:44.167 --> 16:47.634
CLOISTERED IN A SMALL,
DARK ROOM, SURROUNDED
BY VIOLENT IMAGES,

16:47.701 --> 16:49.133
GLAMOROUS, THEN HELLS YEAH.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.701
ABSOLUTELY. IT'S PARIS
IN THE TWENTIES.

16:51.767 --> 16:53.400
[LAUGHS]

16:53.467 --> 16:55.033
YOU WORK MURDER CASES?

16:55.100 --> 16:56.133
MM-HMM. 24/7.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.367
I SEE.

16:57.434 --> 16:59.234
THAT'S THE BIG-TIME
RIGHT THERE.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.067
YOU'RE LIKE A COP
AND BIG BROTHER

17:01.133 --> 17:02.868
ALL ROLLED INTO ONE.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.400
I LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF

17:04.467 --> 17:06.300
AS A TIRELESS CRUSADER
FOR WORLD KARMA.

17:06.367 --> 17:07.701
RIGHT.

17:07.767 --> 17:09.133
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

17:09.200 --> 17:10.834
AH, I DON'T KNOW.

17:10.901 --> 17:12.534
SCHOOL IN NEW HAVEN,

17:12.601 --> 17:14.400
LAW SCHOOL IN BOSTON--

17:14.467 --> 17:16.400
CAMBRIDGE, I GUESS,
TECHNICALLY.

17:16.467 --> 17:18.067
IT'S ALL
ONE COLLEGE TOWN.

17:18.133 --> 17:19.834
WHAT KIND OF LAW
DO YOU PRACTICE?

17:19.901 --> 17:21.534
I WAS A CITY ATTORNEY.

17:21.601 --> 17:24.334
BUT ONCE YOU'VE HAD
A MURDER CASE DISMISSED

17:24.400 --> 17:27.901
FOR JUDICIAL INEPTITUDE
OR A RANDOM COLLATERAL
ESTOPPEL,

17:27.968 --> 17:31.200
LET'S JUST SAY
PRIVATE PRACTICE STARTS
MAKING A LOT OF SENSE.

17:31.267 --> 17:34.601
PEOPLE CAN GET AWAY
WITH MURDER

17:34.667 --> 17:37.200
FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S
INCOMPETENCE.

17:37.267 --> 17:40.601
WELL, WHY AM I
TELLING YOU THIS?

17:40.667 --> 17:42.734
I'M SURE YOU SEE IT
ALL THE TIME.

17:42.801 --> 17:44.367
TO KARMA.

17:45.901 --> 17:49.167
Reid: CITY ATTORNEYS
DON'T TRY MURDER CASES.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.667
WHAT?

17:50.734 --> 17:53.434
Reid: HE KNOWS ENOUGH
TO USE LEGAL TERMINOLOGY,

17:53.501 --> 17:55.534
BUT HE'S NOT ACTUALLY
A WORKING LAWYER.

17:55.601 --> 17:58.033
I THINK WE'RE LOOKING
AT SOMEONE WHO
FAILED OUT OF LAW SCHOOL

17:58.100 --> 17:59.601
OR DIDN'T PASS THE BAR.

17:59.667 --> 18:01.534
DID GARCIA SAY IF HE GAVE
ANY DETAILS ABOUT THE CASES

18:01.601 --> 18:03.334
HE WAS SUPPOSEDLY WORKING?
NO SPECIFICS.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.367
IF HE FAILED OUT OF
THE SYSTEM,
IT COULD EXPLAIN

18:05.434 --> 18:07.868
WHY HE'S GOT
A WORKING VOCABULARY
AND NOT MUCH MORE.

18:07.934 --> 18:09.534
IT COULD ALSO
EXPLAIN HIS ANGER.

18:09.601 --> 18:11.434
EVEN IN HIS LIE,
HE RAILS AGAINST

18:11.501 --> 18:12.734
OTHER PEOPLE'S INCOMPETENCE.

18:12.801 --> 18:14.234
WELL, HE'S CLEARLY A NARCISSIST.

18:14.300 --> 18:16.033
THE CLOTHES, THE WATCH,
THE SUBTLE HINTS

18:16.100 --> 18:17.567
AT WHERE HE WENT TO SCHOOL.

18:17.634 --> 18:18.868
HE'S FAKING HUMILITY

18:18.934 --> 18:21.067
WHEN HE'S SAYING NEW HAVEN
AND CAMBRIDGE

18:21.133 --> 18:22.567
INSTEAD OF YALE AND HARVARD.

18:22.634 --> 18:23.901
J.J., WE NEED AN ANALYST

18:23.968 --> 18:25.234
WHO CAN, UH,
PUT OUR INFORMATION

18:25.300 --> 18:26.734
THROUGH OUR LEGAL DATABASES.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.033
I'M ON IT.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.567
NOW, YOU SURE ANOTHER TECH
IS OK WITH ME IN HER SYSTEM?

18:29.634 --> 18:30.901
WE'RE KIND OF WEIRD
ABOUT THAT.

18:30.968 --> 18:33.133
WE JUST NEED YOU TO RUN
SOME BAR ASSOCIATION RECORDS.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.567
WHY DOESN'T SHE DO IT?

18:34.634 --> 18:35.901
SHE'S IN THE HOSPITAL.

18:35.968 --> 18:37.734
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE ANALYST WHO WAS SHOT.

18:37.801 --> 18:39.467
Hotch: THAT'S RIGHT.

18:39.534 --> 18:41.100
YOU KNOW WHO HIT HER?

18:41.167 --> 18:43.367
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING
TO FIND OUT.

18:44.801 --> 18:46.167
WHAT?

18:46.234 --> 18:48.634
WE'RE THE GATEKEEPERS
TO A WHOLE LOT OF
INFORMATION, MAN.

18:48.701 --> 18:51.267
IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE US ALL
A LITTLE PARANOID.

18:51.334 --> 18:53.767
YOU KNOW, I COULD HAVE
DONE THIS AT MY COMPUTER.

18:53.834 --> 18:57.033
FIRST WE NEED YOU
TO LOOK UP THE NAME
JAMES COLBY BAYLOR

18:57.100 --> 18:59.133
AND SEE IF IT SHOWS UP
ANYWHERE IN THE SYSTEM.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.767
[BEEPING]

19:03.501 --> 19:04.968
WHOA.

19:05.033 --> 19:06.534
WHAT IS IT?

19:06.601 --> 19:08.934
THIS SYSTEM IS INSANE.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.367
IT'S COMPLETELY LINUX-BASED.
OPEN-SOURCED PROGRAMMING.

19:11.434 --> 19:13.667
YOU DON'T SEE THIS
IN GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS,

19:13.734 --> 19:15.300
I MEAN OUTSIDE OF, LIKE,
SWITZERLAND.

19:15.367 --> 19:17.334
JAMES COLBY BAYLOR.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.501
RIGHT. I GET IT.

19:18.567 --> 19:20.601
CHOP-CHOP. JEEZ.

19:25.534 --> 19:27.267
UH-UH. NOTHING.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.467
ALL RIGHT, LET'S START
WITH A LIST OF EVERYONE
IN THE AREA

19:29.534 --> 19:30.868
WHO EITHER FAILED
THE BAR EXAM

19:30.934 --> 19:32.300
OR WAS FIRED
FROM A LARGE LAW FIRM

19:32.367 --> 19:33.601
IN THE LAST 5 YEARS.

19:33.667 --> 19:34.734
WHAT, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

19:34.801 --> 19:36.234
THAT'S GOT TO BE, LIKE,
THOUSANDS OF NAMES.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.634
TRY NARROWING IT DOWN TO
ANYONE WITH THE INITIALS J.C.B.

19:39.701 --> 19:42.934
HE HAD MONOGRAMMED SHIRTS.
TRUST ME, THEY AIN'T CHEAP.

19:45.300 --> 19:47.133
[BEEPING]

19:50.801 --> 19:52.067
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

19:52.133 --> 19:54.467
THIS MIGHT BE THE COOLEST
GIRL I'VE EVER MET.

19:54.534 --> 19:55.567
YOU'VE NEVER
LAID EYES ON HER.

19:55.634 --> 19:57.167
WELL, HER GOOEY
IS MIND-BLOWING.

19:57.234 --> 19:58.968
THE LIST.

32:27.667 --> 32:29.300
TO LOOK INTO CASES FOR THEM.

32:29.367 --> 32:30.400
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

CONSIDERS THEM
A PRIORITY.

TO DO THAT.

THEY DON'T SLIDE.
