00:01.258 --> 00:02.237
There are two kinds of folks

00:02.264 --> 00:03.864
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:04.198 --> 00:05.924
psychopaths
and mystery writers.

00:06.262 --> 00:07.284
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:07.385 --> 00:08.085
Who am I?

00:08.173 --> 00:09.313
I'm Rick Castle.

00:09.314 --> 00:09.714
Castle.

00:09.748 --> 00:10.408
Castle.

00:10.409 --> 00:12.409
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:12.655 --> 00:14.845
Every writer needs  inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:14.955 --> 00:15.774
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:15.809 --> 00:16.829
- Beckett.
- Beckett.

00:16.864 --> 00:18.770
- Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

00:18.816 --> 00:20.302
And thanks to my friendship
with the mayor,

00:20.303 --> 00:21.303
I get to be on her case.

00:21.337 --> 00:23.280
I would be happy
to let you spank me.

00:23.315 --> 00:24.191
And together, we catch killers

00:25.139 --> 00:26.127
We make a pretty
good team, you know?

00:26.228 --> 00:27.228
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:27.362 --> 00:28.056
Turner and Hooch.

00:28.157 --> 00:29.757
You do remind me
a little of Hooch.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.795
♪ I want to trade... ♪

00:33.796 --> 00:36.310
Oh, excuse me, baby.
Oh, boy.

00:36.311 --> 00:38.159
Ah, home sweet home.

00:38.260 --> 00:40.140
Can we get Midnight
from the kennel now?

00:40.141 --> 00:42.141
We'll get him as soon
as we're settled, okay?

00:42.242 --> 00:43.242
I'm hungry.

00:43.642 --> 00:44.782
Let mommy get situated,

00:44.783 --> 00:46.361
then I'll make you a bowl
of hot cereal, okay?

00:46.362 --> 00:47.762
- Okay.
- Come here.

00:49.669 --> 00:51.774
Honey, you said you were
gonna wash the dishes

00:51.775 --> 00:53.044
before we left.

00:54.845 --> 00:56.816
Didn't you make the bed
before we left?

00:56.817 --> 00:58.822
Someone's been sleeping
in our bed.

00:58.823 --> 01:00.561
Someone's been sleeping
in my bed, too,

01:00.562 --> 01:02.064
And he's still there.

01:02.065 --> 01:04.236
What?
Baby, go wait in our room.

01:04.236 --> 01:06.075
Is he asleep?

01:09.884 --> 01:11.955
Oh, yeah!

01:11.956 --> 01:13.759
That's what
I'm talking about.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.933
Darling, must you talk so loud?
Some of us are still waking up.

01:16.934 --> 01:18.571
What's all
the excitement about?

01:18.572 --> 01:20.509
Only
the "New York Ledger's"

01:20.510 --> 01:22.714
annual ten most eligible
bachelor's list,

01:22.715 --> 01:24.885
And guess who's on it.
Who?

01:24.886 --> 01:27.425
I don't know, but he must be
the president of

01:27.426 --> 01:30.163
the really-good-looking club.
Huh. Ranked number 9.

01:30.164 --> 01:32.568
Weren't you number 7 last year?
Yes, and thank you

01:32.569 --> 01:34.507
for pointing out my shortcomings
once again, mother.

01:34.508 --> 01:35.508
Ah, that's my job.

01:35.708 --> 01:37.511
Luckily all my friends
are beyond print media.

01:37.512 --> 01:39.147
What about this
is embarrassing?

01:39.148 --> 01:41.652
Nothing. It's the secret dream
of every 16 year old

01:41.653 --> 01:43.389
to have their father crowned

01:43.390 --> 01:44.860
one of the most
available hotties of the year.

01:44.861 --> 01:45.861
Well, according to this,

01:45.861 --> 01:48.432
<i>your father may not be
on the market.</i>

01:48.433 --> 01:50.771
You didn'tead the blurb here?
Mnh-mnh.

01:50.772 --> 01:53.710
"though claiming to be single,
Richard Castle is rumored to be

01:53.711 --> 01:57.115
romantically involved with NYPD
Detective Kate Beckett"...

01:57.116 --> 01:57.616
What?!

01:57.716 --> 02:00.486
"the inspiration
for Nikki Heat,

02:00.487 --> 02:02.489
"the heroine of
his latest best-selling novel.

02:02.490 --> 02:06.596
<i>Bachelor number 9 may not be
eligible for next year's list."</i>

02:06.597 --> 02:09.067
What? Where did they get that?
Wait. Let me see.

02:09.068 --> 02:11.974
I didn't say anything like that
in my interview..

02:11.975 --> 02:15.113
<i>Detective Beckett is not
going to love this.</i>

02:15.114 --> 02:18.151
Well, maybe she'll just
laugh it off.

02:18.152 --> 02:20.623
How is it, for a man
who is surrounded by women,

02:20.624 --> 02:22.594
that you know so little
about us?

02:22.595 --> 02:24.396
Speak of the devil.

02:24.397 --> 02:27.469
Okay, either Beckett's calling
because there's a dead body

02:27.470 --> 02:30.341
or because she read the article.
Pray for murder.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.016
Good morning.

02:35.017 --> 02:37.319
Dead body. I'm good.

02:37.320 --> 02:40.225
No one else
had access to it, your maid...

02:40.226 --> 02:43.261
No.
Or anything like that? Okay.

02:45.396 --> 02:47.330
Your daughter's school,
they knew about...

02:47.331 --> 02:50.365
they knew about you guys
going out of town?

02:52.000 --> 02:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.973 --> 03:01.407
What?

03:01.408 --> 03:03.811
What, what?

03:03.812 --> 03:05.780
So what have we got?

03:05.781 --> 03:08.417
Your guess is as good as mine.
John Doe, no I.D.

03:08.418 --> 03:11.221
Approximate time of death
is between 9:00 last night

03:11.222 --> 03:12.459
And 1:00 this morning.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.960
The family found him after
returning from vacation.

03:15.060 --> 03:17.129
Apparently he made himself
quite at home.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.198
How so?
Well, we found

03:19.199 --> 03:21.535
his food in the fridge,
toiletries in the bathroom,

03:21.536 --> 03:23.106
even some of his clothes
in the dryer.

03:23.107 --> 03:24.407
A real-life goldilocks.

03:24.507 --> 03:26.810
Mm-hmm. It looks as though he
even slept in the parents' bed.

03:26.811 --> 03:27.711
Well, of course.

03:27.811 --> 03:29.012
That one was too hard,

03:29.013 --> 03:30.915
and baby bear's bed
was just right.

03:31.616 --> 03:32.451
Looks like he struggled.

03:32.452 --> 03:33.452
Unsuccessfully.

03:33.752 --> 03:37.321
Here. You see at? It's
a needle mark from a syringe.

03:37.322 --> 03:39.157
Probably was injected
with something

03:39.158 --> 03:39.960
that stopped his heart.

03:39.961 --> 03:41.329
I'll run toxicology.

03:41.330 --> 03:43.298
as soon as I can pinpoint
a C.O.D., I'll give you a call.

03:43.299 --> 03:44.099
Great. Thank you.

03:44.199 --> 03:45.265
Mm-hmm.

03:46.066 --> 03:46.800
Hey.

03:48.303 --> 03:50.238
You know who kills
with syringes?

03:50.239 --> 03:52.007
Mad doctors
and b-movie nazis.

03:52.008 --> 03:54.109
Why not just use a gun?
Guns are loud.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.678
I've seen squatters
in abandoned buildings,

03:56.679 --> 03:57.647
but nothing like this.

03:57.648 --> 04:00.250
And then someone sneaks in
and kills him with a needle.

04:00.251 --> 04:01.452
Weird.
Mm-hmm.

04:01.453 --> 04:02.453
How are
the Dysons doing?

04:02.553 --> 04:04.289
Mom and dad
are pretty shaken up.

04:04.290 --> 04:05.926
Little girl doesn't really know
what's going on.

04:05.927 --> 04:07.127
Did anyone know
they were leaving town?

04:07.727 --> 04:09.962
Uh, just people from work,
daughter's school,

04:09.963 --> 04:10.898
stuff like that.
We're running it down.

04:10.899 --> 04:11.899
Hey, check this out.

04:12.399 --> 04:14.466
Dysons found this
in the kitchen,

04:14.467 --> 04:16.201
said it's not theirs.

04:19.002 --> 04:21.070
This is here.

04:21.071 --> 04:22.671
Yeah, weird, huh?

04:22.672 --> 04:24.573
Why would he take pictures?

04:24.574 --> 04:26.942
So he could put everything back
the way he found it.

04:26.943 --> 04:28.977
He was hoping nobody
would know that he was here.

04:28.978 --> 04:29.945
Almost as though
he was hiding.

04:29.946 --> 04:31.746
All right, have a tech
pull the memory card.

04:31.746 --> 04:34.514
See if any of the deleted photos
can tell us who he is.

04:34.515 --> 04:37.450
Ooh, she is gonna kill him.
He's dead.

04:37.451 --> 04:41.519
So, Castle, is it true? Are you
finally off the market?

04:41.520 --> 04:44.255
You guys, if either of you
breathe a word of this...

04:44.256 --> 04:45.424
I swear, I will make you pay.

04:45.425 --> 04:47.425
Montgomery's up to speed.
Anything back from

04:47.525 --> 04:50.462
the Dysons' workplace
or the kid's... School?

04:50.463 --> 04:51.663
I ran background checks

04:51.763 --> 04:53.698
on everyone who knew the family
was gonna be out of town.

04:53.699 --> 04:56.100
So far everyone's come back clean,
but I'm gonna keep digging.

04:56.070 --> 04:57.070
Anything on the canvass?

04:57.170 --> 04:58.937
A whole lot of nothing.
No doorman on the building.

04:58.938 --> 05:01.439
None of the Dyson's neighbors
noticed anything out of the ordinary.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.908
Shocker. I've lived
in my spot eight years.

05:04.009 --> 05:05.078
I couldn't pick my neighbors
out of a lineup.

05:05.079 --> 05:06.379
Well, that's Manhattan
for you.

05:06.479 --> 05:08.613
Nobody notices anything unless
it affects them directly.

05:09.014 --> 05:11.850
Unless it's in the paper.
Excuse me. Beckett.

05:13.151 --> 05:14.351
Great. Okay, good.

05:14.451 --> 05:16.383
Got a hit off of
John Doe's fingerprints.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.618
Douglass Bishop.
He's in the system.

05:20.420 --> 05:21.752
Douglass Bishop...

05:21.753 --> 05:25.187
arrested once ten years ago--

05:25.188 --> 05:26.955
Misdemeanor
drunk and disorderly.

05:26.956 --> 05:29.490
Charges were dropped.
Besides that, he's clean.

05:29.491 --> 05:31.525
All right,
find the next of kin.

05:31.526 --> 05:32.628
After they I.D. the body,
maybe they can tell us

05:32.629 --> 05:35.629
what the hell he was doing
in that apartment.

05:35.930 --> 05:38.099
I got the results back
from the lab.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.766
He was injected with
an anesthetic--ketamine.

05:40.767 --> 05:44.134
Special "K"?
He was killed by a club drug?

05:44.135 --> 05:45.435
Not in this dose.

05:45.736 --> 05:48.204
Whoever shot up Mr. Bishop was
not looking to get him high.

05:48.205 --> 05:50.207
Gave him enough
to put down a horse.

05:52.308 --> 05:53.408
The victim's sister
is here.

05:53.409 --> 05:54.909
I'm Detective Beckett.

05:54.910 --> 05:57.679
Thank you so much
for coming down.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.313
Is--is that him?

05:59.314 --> 06:02.082
Is that Doug?

06:03.083 --> 06:05.485
That's what we'll need you
to verify.

06:12.857 --> 06:15.258
None of this
makes any sense.

06:15.259 --> 06:17.993
I mean, why would Doug be living
in these people's apartment?

06:17.994 --> 06:19.195
He's got his own place
out in Hoboken.

06:19.196 --> 06:20.896
Is it possible that
your brother was in trouble,

06:20.996 --> 06:22.696
that he was hiding
from someone?

06:22.697 --> 06:24.664
No. Everybody loved Doug.

06:24.665 --> 06:27.065
Did he owe anybody money

06:27.066 --> 06:29.100
or have
any financial problems?

06:29.101 --> 06:30.735
Not that I know of.

06:30.736 --> 06:32.736
I-I mean, his hours
at the travel agency

06:32.737 --> 06:34.337
got cut back,

06:34.338 --> 06:35.904
but he was getting by.

06:35.905 --> 06:38.006
Travel agency.

06:38.007 --> 06:39.542
Maybe that's how he knew
the Dysons were out of town.

06:39.543 --> 06:40.643
But if he were in trouble,

06:40.743 --> 06:42.380
he would've raided
his scuba fund.

06:43.081 --> 06:44.081
Yeah.

06:44.381 --> 06:47.383
He was always saying that
someday when his ship came in,

06:47.384 --> 06:49.387
he was gonna get himself
a little--

06:49.388 --> 06:50.391
A little scuba shop
down in Jamaica.

06:50.392 --> 06:52.092
Doug was saving up for it.

06:52.192 --> 06:54.393
He would put a portion of his paycheck

06:54.394 --> 06:55.662
in an account every month.

06:55.663 --> 06:57.632
When was the last time
you saw your brother?

06:58.133 --> 06:59.767
Not since the holiday party.

07:01.168 --> 07:03.936
Doug's agency threw it
out by the airport,

07:03.937 --> 07:06.772
which is where Stan works,
so we all went.

07:06.773 --> 07:09.674
You just never think something
like this is gonna happen.

07:09.675 --> 07:12.843
So you don't make time.

07:12.844 --> 07:14.411
Okay, thank you.

07:17.215 --> 07:19.683
That was the travel agency.

07:19.684 --> 07:21.551
If Doug was hiding
from someone,

07:21.552 --> 07:23.586
he wasn't doing
a very good job.

07:23.587 --> 07:26.321
Apparently he hasn't missed
a day of work until yesterday.

07:26.322 --> 07:27.190
What about the Dysons' trip?

07:27.191 --> 07:28.891
They booked it
through a different agency.

07:29.191 --> 07:31.192
The scuba fund?
Didn't touch it.

07:31.193 --> 07:34.128
So he wasn't in hiding,
he didn't owe anybody any money

07:34.129 --> 07:36.263
and he had no discernable way

07:36.264 --> 07:37.566
of knowing when the Dysons
would be out of town.

07:37.567 --> 07:38.567
Hey, Beckett.

07:39.367 --> 07:41.435
The geeks managed to pull
the deleted photos from

07:41.436 --> 07:44.404
our squatter's memory card.
Care to take a look?

07:44.405 --> 07:47.673
Stuff on counters,
inside cabinets.

07:47.674 --> 07:49.273
That's not
the Dysons' place.

07:49.274 --> 07:51.539
He's done this before,
but in other apartments.

07:51.540 --> 07:52.541
Maybe he does it
for the thrill.

07:52.742 --> 07:54.742
Maybe someone found out
and got mad.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.610
Yeah, but he'd still have to
know when they were away.

07:58.611 --> 08:01.613
Unless Doug Bishop
isn't our squatter.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.881
That's definitely not
Doug Bishop.

08:03.882 --> 08:05.017
Who is he?

08:06.318 --> 08:09.086
He's probably our killer.

What kind of psychopath

08:17.008 --> 08:19.476
Takes pictures of himself
and his murder weapons?

08:19.477 --> 08:20.477
Some killers keep trophies.

08:20.777 --> 08:23.845
In his defense,
he did delete these photos.

08:23.846 --> 08:27.482
.45 with a silencer. Wonder what
he had lined up for this?

08:27.483 --> 08:29.984
Nothing good. Has C.S.U.
pulled the prints

08:29.985 --> 08:31.253
off of the camera
and personal effects?

08:31.254 --> 08:32.254
Yeah, they don't match
Doug Bishop

08:32.154 --> 08:34.154
and they're not
in the system.

08:34.155 --> 08:35.256
Which means
he doesn't have a record.

08:35.256 --> 08:36.557
Well, if Doug wasn't
our squatter,

08:36.657 --> 08:38.357
what was he doing
in the Dysons' apartment?

08:38.458 --> 08:40.360
He had to have known
the squatter somehow.

08:40.361 --> 08:41.561
If this squatter
was so meticulous

08:41.660 --> 08:43.895
about putting things back,
why'd he leave all this for us to find?

08:43.895 --> 08:45.964
You're right.
It--it makes no sense.

08:46.965 --> 08:49.967
What? No grand theatrical theory
to spin for us?

08:49.968 --> 08:51.902
Honestly, I-I got nothing.

08:51.903 --> 08:54.471
More importantly, we don't have
any prints or leads.

08:54.472 --> 08:55.907
How are we
gonna catch a ghost?

08:56.108 --> 08:57.508
By finding out how he haunts.

08:57.608 --> 09:00.476
If we can figure out
how the squatter knew

09:00.477 --> 09:03.445
his marks were out of town,
find something that connects him

09:03.446 --> 09:04.446
to the other places
that he stayed,

09:04.547 --> 09:05.781
then maybe we can
narrow down the field.

09:05.782 --> 09:07.082
We'll ke going through these.

09:07.182 --> 09:09.050
With any luck, we'll find
something that can tell us

09:09.051 --> 09:12.019
whose apartments these are.
Okay, great. Thank you.

09:20.258 --> 09:22.493
Hey.

09:22.494 --> 09:24.494
Hey.
What are you doing?

09:24.495 --> 09:26.197
I'm looking to see
who won the game last night.

09:26.198 --> 09:27.198
Oh, we won.

09:27.898 --> 09:28.633
Do you even know what game
I'm talking about?

09:28.634 --> 09:29.634
Sure I do...

09:29.935 --> 09:30.935
the big game.

09:33.671 --> 09:35.006
Okay, Castle.
What's going on?

09:35.107 --> 09:36.774
Yo, Beckett. Check this out.

09:36.775 --> 09:39.343
He took a picture of the inside
of someone's medicine cabinet.

09:39.344 --> 09:41.413
You can almost make out the name
on these prescription bottles.

09:42.214 --> 09:43.414
Have I.S.
take a look at it,

09:43.514 --> 09:45.081
see if they can enhance
the photo.

09:50.685 --> 09:51.552
Oh, God.

09:51.553 --> 09:53.753
He went through
my medicine cabinet?

09:53.754 --> 09:56.088
Please tell me
he didn't go through my diary.

09:56.089 --> 09:58.090
Oh, we're not sure,
Ms. Langford.

09:58.091 --> 09:59.492
Are you sure
you don't recognize him?

09:59.493 --> 10:00.493
Yeah, I'm positive.

10:00.793 --> 10:03.561
And you don't know the Dysons?
No.

10:03.562 --> 10:06.231
The only person that knew I was
even out of town was my mother.

10:06.232 --> 10:08.533
Everyone else
thought I was on sick leave.

10:08.534 --> 10:11.002
You won't tell my boss that,
will you?

10:11.003 --> 10:13.971
Did you notice anything unusual
when you returned?

10:15.072 --> 10:17.207
Oh,
that totally explains it.

10:17.208 --> 10:18.209
What?

10:18.210 --> 10:20.810
My faucet. For weeks,
I've been asking my super

10:20.910 --> 10:22.745
to fix my leaky faucet,
but he never came.

10:22.746 --> 10:24.613
and then when I got back,
it was fixed.

10:24.614 --> 10:26.516
So I just assumed
that he finally did it,

10:26.617 --> 10:28.486
but then later,
when I saw him on the stairs,

10:29.087 --> 10:30.321
He didn't even know
what I was talking about.

10:30.322 --> 10:32.122
The squatter fixed your sink?

10:32.822 --> 10:35.088
Yeah. And there was
this bottle of, um,

10:35.289 --> 10:37.858
like weird strawberry champagne
in the fridge.

10:38.259 --> 10:40.594
And I just assumed that
one of my friends had left it

10:40.595 --> 10:44.663
during a dinner party I had
before I left, but...

10:44.664 --> 10:46.932
none of my friends
would've bought such a--

10:46.933 --> 10:49.000
cheap bottle of booze.
Exactly.

10:49.001 --> 10:51.335
So he makes repairs,

10:51.336 --> 10:54.470
leaves hostess gifts--
he's the gentleman squatter.

10:54.471 --> 10:56.241
Who killed a man,
so don't make him out to be

10:56.242 --> 10:57.510
the houseguest of the year.

10:57.911 --> 10:59.483
Thank you for coming in,
Ms. Langford.

10:59.584 --> 11:04.019
By the way, that photo in the paper
did you no justice.

11:04.020 --> 11:05.555
You're much better looking
in person.

11:05.756 --> 11:07.356
There's a picture of you
in the paper?

11:07.556 --> 11:09.991
So are you
the Detective girlfriend?

11:10.292 --> 11:12.059
I'm sorry, the what?

11:12.060 --> 11:15.095
He... is such a catch.

11:15.096 --> 11:16.196
Don't.

11:16.197 --> 11:18.831
Show me. Now.

11:18.832 --> 11:21.967
"romantically involved"?
"rumored to be."

11:21.968 --> 11:23.004
What did you tell them?

11:23.005 --> 11:24.905
Nothing!
Why would I do that?

11:25.005 --> 11:26.938
Do you have any idea what this
does to my reputation?

11:27.039 --> 11:29.640
Your reputation?
What about my reputation?

11:29.641 --> 11:31.743
I am just as upset as you are.
I'm on your team.

11:32.144 --> 11:33.178
This is shoddy journalism,

11:33.179 --> 11:35.749
and I am two seconds away
from canceling my subscription.

11:35.750 --> 11:36.451
My subscription.

11:36.452 --> 11:40.252
Do you have any idea how hard
it is to be a female cop?

11:40.352 --> 11:42.487
The last thing I need is for you
to give them more ammo to--

11:42.488 --> 11:43.588
Yes, the "New York Ledger,"
please.

11:43.630 --> 11:44.156
What are you doing?

11:44.157 --> 11:45.757
Langford said that
the only person

11:45.857 --> 11:48.292
who knew she was on vacation was
her mother, but that's not true.

11:48.393 --> 11:50.296
If she was actually
pretending to be sick,

11:50.297 --> 11:52.600
the last thing she'd want is newspapers
piling up at her front door.

11:52.801 --> 11:53.834
She had the papers held.

11:53.935 --> 11:55.436
Yes, your subscription
department, please.

11:55.737 --> 11:58.872
Anyone with access to vacation
hold information would know

11:58.873 --> 12:01.142
exactly who's out of town
and for exactly how long.

12:01.243 --> 12:04.545
Yes, I would like to verify
vacation hold information

12:04.646 --> 12:06.447
on two of your subscribers,
please.

12:07.648 --> 12:10.382
Who am I? I... I...

12:10.783 --> 12:13.083
I sometimes forget
I'm not actually a cop.

12:13.084 --> 12:14.084
I don't.

12:15.184 --> 12:17.617
Hi. This is Detective
Kate Beckett with the NYPD.

12:17.618 --> 12:19.151
I'd like to speak with
your supervisor, please.

12:19.752 --> 12:21.118
I can't really say
he looks familiar,

12:21.119 --> 12:23.853
but you gotta understand,
we have hundreds of employees.

12:24.354 --> 12:25.588
Well, how many of them
had access

12:25.589 --> 12:27.156
to vacation hold
information?

12:27.757 --> 12:29.791
Well, you got about a dozen
in subscriptions,

12:29.792 --> 12:31.292
another handful in billing,

12:31.293 --> 12:33.392
and, of course,
the newspaperboys themselves.

12:33.693 --> 12:36.392
I'm gonna need to see
a list of their names.

12:36.593 --> 12:38.159
Sure. Follow me.

12:45.097 --> 12:45.863
Donna.

12:46.864 --> 12:49.131
Richard.
What are you doing here?

12:49.232 --> 12:51.265
Uh, you're not mad about
number 9, are you?

12:51.266 --> 12:53.266
I told my editor
to keep you at 7.

12:53.267 --> 12:56.166
No, no, it's not that.
I don't care about that... much.

12:56.167 --> 12:59.168
It's--I just--why did you say
I was dating Detective Beckett?

12:59.169 --> 13:01.503
Oh. Well, I just assumed.

13:01.504 --> 13:03.605
You kept bringing her up
during the interview.

13:03.606 --> 13:04.475
No, I didn't.

13:04.476 --> 13:06.976
Sure you did.
You went on and on about her.

13:07.076 --> 13:09.643
"Beckett said the funniest this,
she's the best that."

13:09.644 --> 13:10.979
Really? I did that?

13:11.080 --> 13:12.380
Last year all you did
was talk about yourself.

13:12.480 --> 13:15.215
Well, Donna,
I am very, very single.

13:15.416 --> 13:17.883
Really?
Because if you aren't involved,

13:17.884 --> 13:20.219
bachelorette number 3
asked about you this morning.

13:20.420 --> 13:23.255
Did you see her? No?

13:23.256 --> 13:25.356
Or are you one of those people
who never goes below the fold?

13:25.357 --> 13:27.925
Oh, I go below the fold.

13:27.926 --> 13:28.827
It's just,
lately I've been very busy

13:28.828 --> 13:31.797
with my second Nikki Heat novel,
and I nev--oh, my God.

13:31.798 --> 13:32.798
Mm-hmm. Amanda Livingston.

13:35.198 --> 13:36.966
So do you want her number?
'cause she wants yours.

13:41.436 --> 13:42.904
Hey, we got a match.

13:43.205 --> 13:45.139
Mickey Carlson, delivery boy.

13:45.140 --> 13:45.741
Both the Dysons

13:45.742 --> 13:47.308
and Michele Langford
are on his route.

13:47.309 --> 13:48.709
Delivery boy. Knew it.

13:48.809 --> 13:50.476
Anyway,
he didn't show this morning.

13:50.477 --> 13:51.943
Another carrier had to cover.

13:51.944 --> 13:53.779
You know, there's no address
on this application.

13:53.780 --> 13:54.614
Do you have one on file?

13:54.615 --> 13:57.215
Nah. He never gave us one,
and now I know why.

13:57.415 --> 13:59.617
It says there that payday
is tomorrow.

13:59.918 --> 14:01.818
Does Mickey do direct deposit
or does--

14:01.819 --> 14:04.187
Pick up his own check?
Like clockwork.

14:04.188 --> 14:06.689
Payroll comes in at 10:00
in the morning,

14:06.690 --> 14:08.357
Mickey's here at 10:01.

14:08.358 --> 14:10.292
A delivery boy

14:10.293 --> 14:12.660
with a silencer
and syringes full of ketamine?

14:12.661 --> 14:13.694
His job's just a front

14:13.795 --> 14:15.363
for whatever business
he's really in.

14:15.764 --> 14:19.165
Here's a list of all of
the vacation holds on his route.

14:19.266 --> 14:20.766
He could be squatting
at any one of them.

14:20.867 --> 14:23.802
He's armed, so make sure
your teams use extreme caution.

14:23.803 --> 14:25.904
Castle and I will set up
at the paper in case he shows.

14:25.905 --> 14:27.105
If he's out there,
we'll find him.

14:27.505 --> 14:28.438
It's ironic, you know.

14:28.439 --> 14:30.440
People put in vacation holds
to avoid break-ins.

14:30.441 --> 14:31.641
Good use of irony.

14:34.876 --> 14:36.111
So who's your friend
at the paper?

14:36.112 --> 14:37.312
Oh, Donna Vincennes?

14:37.412 --> 14:39.280
Mm-hmm.
She's the one who wrote
the blurb about us.

14:40.181 --> 14:42.115
There is no "us."

14:42.116 --> 14:43.116
I know that.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.150
Did you tell her that?

14:44.151 --> 14:45.451
Yes, I did,

14:45.551 --> 14:47.819
Which worked out, actually,
really well for me.

14:47.820 --> 14:48.954
As it turns out,

14:49.055 --> 14:51.788
<i>most eligible
bachelorette numero tres--</i>

14:51.989 --> 14:53.823
very interested in meeting me.

14:53.924 --> 14:56.291
Once the info-tainers
get ahold of her with me,

14:56.292 --> 14:58.393
they're gonna forget all about
you and I.

14:58.794 --> 15:00.261
I can just see
the headlines now--

15:00.362 --> 15:03.129
"9 meets 3 at dinner for 2."

15:03.130 --> 15:04.597
Believe it or not,

15:04.598 --> 15:05.599
there's a lot of women
in this town

15:05.600 --> 15:08.001
who like the idea of being
romantically linked to me.

15:21.010 --> 15:22.510
I have no life.

15:22.511 --> 15:25.979
No, Mr. Bishop has no life.
That's why he's on my table.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.581
I need a date.

15:29.582 --> 15:30.249
What?

15:30.250 --> 15:33.451
A date. A... guy.
A... man.

15:33.452 --> 15:35.653
You're always trying
to set me up with people.

15:35.654 --> 15:38.021
So here I am. I'm game.
What do you got?

15:38.022 --> 15:39.523
Okay.

15:39.524 --> 15:41.258
What's gotten into you?

15:41.259 --> 15:43.893
I get so wrapped up in work,
all I want to do

15:43.894 --> 15:46.695
is go home where it's quiet,
and I'm so tired of quiet.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.296
I want... loud.

15:50.897 --> 15:51.665
Okay.

15:51.666 --> 15:55.001
I have the perfect prescription
for you.

15:59.004 --> 16:00.005
Bradekker?

16:00.006 --> 16:01.872
No, no, baby.
That's Brad Dekker.

16:02.173 --> 16:04.441
That firefighter I wanted
to set you up with.

16:04.642 --> 16:06.709
Is he cute?
He was Mr. July

16:06.710 --> 16:09.243
in last year's
New York firefighters calendar.

16:09.544 --> 16:11.580
July. Huh.
Mm-hmm.

16:11.581 --> 16:13.853
They always put the really hot
ones in the summer months.

16:14.454 --> 16:15.454
Exactly.

16:15.854 --> 16:17.789
Well, then should we say
around 8:00?

16:17.890 --> 16:20.292
All right. Me, too.

16:21.093 --> 16:22.228
Good night, Amanda.

16:22.229 --> 16:24.630
Ahh.
Sorry I missed dinner.

16:24.631 --> 16:26.498
There's quiche
if you're hungry.

16:26.499 --> 16:29.200
<i>Sweet.
Or savory, actually.</i>

16:29.701 --> 16:31.770
So... how was your day?

16:33.771 --> 16:36.713
I had a truly great day.
I got pulled out of class

16:36.714 --> 16:38.482
and called to
the vice principal's office.

16:38.483 --> 16:39.586
Why? What did she want?

16:40.287 --> 16:41.187
You.

16:41.387 --> 16:43.254
Here's her number.
Her number?

16:43.255 --> 16:45.656
Oh, and my german teacher,
fraulein Sonnenberg,

16:45.657 --> 16:47.358
<i>Wanted me to tell you,
auf deutsch,</i>

16:47.359 --> 16:49.361
<i>"du hast sex-appeal."</i>

16:49.362 --> 16:51.232
She's two years from ordering
off the senior menu,

16:51.233 --> 16:52.337
but here's her number, too.

16:53.238 --> 16:54.338
Fraulein Sonnenberg?

16:54.438 --> 16:55.906
Too old? That's okay
'cause my friend Sloan

16:55.907 --> 16:57.742
thinks you're "real choice."

16:58.243 --> 17:00.078
She's 17, but she'll be legal
in 3 months.

17:00.379 --> 17:02.181
Hey. Maybe we could double.

17:02.882 --> 17:06.182
Oh, you hate me a little bit
right now, don't you?

17:06.382 --> 17:07.951
Just a little.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.152
What did Beckett say?

17:09.452 --> 17:11.519
Oh, I'm sure
she'll be fine with it.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.387
Maybe even
a little flattered.

17:15.022 --> 17:16.457
Flattered?

17:16.458 --> 17:19.127
I was gonna...

17:19.127 --> 17:21.529
Eat that.

17:23.265 --> 17:24.666
10:15.
Mickey's a no-show.

17:24.667 --> 17:25.867
Patience, Castle.

17:26.968 --> 17:29.034
Hey, have you
ever heard of Drago?

17:29.535 --> 17:30.235
Yeah.

17:30.277 --> 17:32.668
It's on the "Ledger's" top ten
most romantic restaurants.

17:32.669 --> 17:35.436
It's pricey and impossible
to get a table,

17:35.437 --> 17:37.070
unless you know someone.

17:37.071 --> 17:38.672
Why?

17:38.673 --> 17:40.673
Just looking
for a place to go.

17:40.674 --> 17:43.775
What, like on a date?
Yes, on a date.

17:43.776 --> 17:46.211
Why do you sound so surprised?
No, I--

17:46.212 --> 17:49.114
No, I just, uh, never figured
you for a Drago kind of girl.

17:49.115 --> 17:52.417
Really? And what kind of a girl
do you figure me for, Castle?

17:52.418 --> 17:54.052
I... It--

17:54.053 --> 17:55.786
Oh! There's your boy

17:57.355 --> 17:59.623
Mickey Carlson, I'm--hey!

17:59.624 --> 18:01.091
Hey!

18:04.762 --> 18:07.128
Mickey Carlson...
Oh!

18:07.529 --> 18:09.828
You're under arrest for
the murder of Douglass Bishop.

18:10.203 --> 18:12.103
This is the ketamine that you
used to kill Doug Bishop.

18:12.104 --> 18:13.638
Whoa. No, no,
that's not mine.

18:13.639 --> 18:15.939
Pretty smart not using the gun, Mickey.

18:16.039 --> 18:17.207
That would've been too messy.

18:17.208 --> 18:19.608
That's not my gun. Look, I
didn't kill anybody. I swear.

18:19.708 --> 18:21.576
I'm not a criminal, all right?
I was just squatting there.

18:21.577 --> 18:23.377
Well, technically,
squatting is a crime.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.512
Yeah, a victimless crime,
especially the way I do it.

18:25.513 --> 18:27.014
If you
didn't kill Doug Bishop,

18:27.015 --> 18:29.450
then how did he end up dead
in the Dysons' apartment?

18:29.451 --> 18:30.651
The guy from
the Maitlands' apartment

18:30.751 --> 18:31.553
must have killed him.

18:31.554 --> 18:32.554
And who are the Maitlands?

18:32.854 --> 18:34.558
The people whose apartment
I stayed in before the Dysons.

18:35.159 --> 18:36.659
Okay, why don't you
start from the beginning,

18:36.660 --> 18:38.360
and take us through it from there.

18:38.361 --> 18:39.361
Maitlands put a week hold
on their paper,

18:40.359 --> 18:42.428
which I was psyched about,
'cause they live on East 27th,

18:42.429 --> 18:43.896
which has
amazing indian restaurants.

18:43.997 --> 18:46.065
So I pick the lock,
I start taking pictures

18:46.166 --> 18:48.334
so I can return everything
to its original state.

18:48.535 --> 18:51.002
So, I'm taking pictures when I find
these syringes on the table.

18:51.103 --> 18:53.004
Kinda weird, but I'm thinking,
maybe one of the Maitlands

18:53.105 --> 18:54.740
must be diabetic
or something, right?

18:54.741 --> 18:57.375
So I keep going.
Then bam--it hits me.

18:57.376 --> 18:59.577
What's a gun with a silencer
doing out on the bed?

18:59.578 --> 19:01.945
And next to it,
I see all this gear.

19:03.746 --> 19:04.346
Gear?

19:04.546 --> 19:06.079
Mountain climbing equipment.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.615
At this point, I seen enough.
I decide to get outta there.

19:08.616 --> 19:10.616
But just as I'm grabbing
my stuff,

19:10.617 --> 19:12.184
I hear the door unlock.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.819
And I barely reach the closet
in time.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.087
I could see 'em through
the slats. It was three of 'em.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.690
It was, uh, this guy,
a plain-looking dude

19:18.691 --> 19:20.758
and tough-looking S.O.B.

19:20.759 --> 19:23.627
Man, he had a scar on his face
looked like a crescent moon.

19:24.228 --> 19:25.728
A crescent moon?

19:25.729 --> 19:27.463
I know, right?
It's crazy.

19:27.464 --> 19:28.831
Anyway,
they head into the back.

19:28.832 --> 19:29.832
I take the opportunity

19:29.933 --> 19:31.768
to grab my stuff
and get the hell outta there.

19:31.769 --> 19:35.136
I end up at the Dysons'. Take
a load off, I get comfortable,

19:35.137 --> 19:36.638
when outta nowhere,
the front door opens,

19:36.639 --> 19:38.173
and him and his friend come in.

19:38.974 --> 19:40.274
Who,
crescent-moon scar face?

19:40.374 --> 19:41.975
No, the--the other guy.
The plain one.

19:41.976 --> 19:44.610
They grab me and demand that
I give them their phone back.

19:44.711 --> 19:45.681
Their phone?

19:45.682 --> 19:47.982
Are you making this up
as you go?

19:48.082 --> 19:50.449
No, no, no, see, in my race
to get out of the Maitlands',

19:50.450 --> 19:51.584
I must have grabbed
one of their jackets,

19:51.585 --> 19:54.286
which had their phone in it,
but I don't know how they knew.

19:55.087 --> 19:56.721
Newer phones have gps.
They could track it on the web.

19:57.122 --> 19:57.922
Huh?

19:58.022 --> 20:00.523
Well, I didn't want their phone
and I tried to give it back.

20:00.524 --> 20:03.224
The guy pulls out a syringe
and is ready to stab me with it.

20:03.225 --> 20:05.426
But thank God for Doug.
Oh, man.

20:05.627 --> 20:08.128
Doug says,
"I didn't sign up for murder."

20:08.129 --> 20:11.031
Then they start arguing,
and then the syringe guy says,

20:11.032 --> 20:13.966
"we've got 3 mil on the line.
He's seen too much."

20:14.367 --> 20:15.568
Next thing I know,
they're fighting.

20:16.569 --> 20:17.736
So I ran outta there.

20:17.737 --> 20:19.037
I'm just saying,

20:19.237 --> 20:21.172
It's a really good story.
Come on.

20:21.173 --> 20:23.673
Mysterious bad guys,
crescent-shaped scars,

20:23.674 --> 20:24.542
hiding in a closet?

20:24.543 --> 20:27.143
It sounds like fiction
because it probably is.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.344
Well, that's too bad.
He's a nice guy.

20:29.345 --> 20:30.245
So was Jeffrey Dahmer.

20:30.346 --> 20:31.880
Didn't stop him
from eating people.

20:33.281 --> 20:34.382
Where are we
on these Maitlands?

20:34.383 --> 20:35.683
They're on a cruise ship,
but we're getting

20:35.783 --> 20:37.018
the ship's security
to track 'em down right now.

20:37.019 --> 20:38.319
All right,
have 'em track faster.

20:38.419 --> 20:39.653
I need their permission
to get into the place.

20:39.654 --> 20:40.754
Can't we just get a warrant?

20:41.154 --> 20:42.922
On the word of
a possible murder suspect?

20:42.923 --> 20:45.257
Not exactly probable cause.

20:45.258 --> 20:47.258
But once we disprove
Mr. Carlson's story,

20:47.259 --> 20:50.494
we'll be able
to press charges for murder.

20:51.329 --> 20:53.563
Beckett.

20:53.564 --> 20:56.298
Oh, hi, Brad.

20:56.299 --> 20:59.267
Uh, uh, no. No, no, no,
it's not too last-minute.

20:59.268 --> 21:01.703
Actually, my plans for tonight
just fell through.

21:01.704 --> 21:03.638
Who's Brad?

21:03.639 --> 21:05.573
Mm.
Must be Lanie's friend.

21:05.574 --> 21:07.040
You know him?

21:07.041 --> 21:09.076
<i>Yeah, met him once.
Good guy.</i>

21:09.077 --> 21:11.778
Fireman.
I could be there
in a couple of hours.

21:11.779 --> 21:14.581
He was in the F.D.N.Y. calendar.
Chiseled good looks.

21:14.582 --> 21:16.349
Rock-hard abs.

21:16.350 --> 21:19.118
Oh, and get this--
once during a fire,

21:19.119 --> 21:21.353
after saving the parents
and the kids,

21:21.354 --> 21:24.223
he went back in
for the puppies.

21:24.224 --> 21:26.458
See you then.
Did she just flip her hair?

21:26.459 --> 21:28.360
I'm telling you, bro,
puppies...

21:28.361 --> 21:30.763
Gets 'em every time.
Puppies.

21:35.334 --> 21:37.002
Yes, Mr. Maitland?
What?

21:37.003 --> 21:39.840
You're smiling.
So?

21:39.841 --> 21:42.576
Good-bye. Hey.
We got the Maitlands.

21:42.577 --> 21:44.543
We're good to enter. They're
calling the super right now.

21:44.544 --> 21:45.544
Okay, let's go.

21:51.013 --> 21:52.881
Stay out here, please sir.

21:56.352 --> 21:58.420
We'll check the back.
Okay.

22:03.691 --> 22:05.224
Well, surprise, surprise.

22:05.225 --> 22:08.193
Nothing here to verify
Mickey's version.

22:08.194 --> 22:10.761
Oh, wow. Look at this.

22:10.762 --> 22:12.431
Did you find something?

22:12.432 --> 22:14.700
Yeah, it's
an old-fashioned dumbwaiter.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.268
You don't see these
around anymore.

22:16.269 --> 22:17.570
Genius, too.
The Maitlands have converted it

22:17.571 --> 22:19.505
into a hidden
stereo component cupboard.

22:19.606 --> 22:20.942
I bet they have
an R.F. Remote somewhere.

22:21.543 --> 22:23.143
We're not here to admire
the place, Castle.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.411
How can you not?
I mean, look at this place.

22:26.412 --> 22:29.413
This apartment is prewar,
late 1800s.

22:29.914 --> 22:31.448
Oh, you see this molding?

22:31.449 --> 22:33.983
<i>That is the original wood.
Gorgeous.</i>

22:33.984 --> 22:35.752
I bet the bathrooms
have marble wainscoting.

22:35.753 --> 22:37.520
You're such a metrosexual.

22:37.621 --> 22:39.756
Yes. Well, better than being
a pinup boy.

22:40.757 --> 22:43.457
So you heard?
And it's pinup man, Castle.

22:43.858 --> 22:45.159
Pinup... Man.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.160
Yes. Well, have fun
with your hose jockey

22:47.161 --> 22:49.162
<i>whilst I go out
with nuevo york's</i>

22:49.163 --> 22:50.863
most eligible bachelorette
number 3.

22:50.864 --> 22:53.665
Oh, I guess that means
she must be slumming it,

22:53.666 --> 22:56.635
her being number 3
and you being a lowly number 9.

22:56.636 --> 22:58.703
What number were you again?
Oh.

22:58.704 --> 23:00.238
Place is clear.

23:00.239 --> 23:03.473
No gun, no ketamine,
no mountain climbing equipment.

23:03.474 --> 23:05.274
There is nothing here.

23:05.275 --> 23:06.708
Yes, there is.

23:06.709 --> 23:08.610
An icebox,
circa late 1800s.

23:08.611 --> 23:11.180
You see, before the invention

23:11.181 --> 23:12.781
of modern
household refrigeration,

23:12.782 --> 23:15.250
People used to keep
their perishable items in a box

23:15.251 --> 23:17.085
that held ice.

23:17.086 --> 23:18.321
Hence--an icebox.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.222
It's not an open house,
Castle.

23:20.622 --> 23:22.221
Oh, the Maitlands
were very clever.

23:22.222 --> 23:23.956
They converted this
into a cupboard.

23:23.957 --> 23:26.858
Meanwhile, it's right next
to their fridge--aah!

23:27.859 --> 23:32.295
Ooh!

23:32.296 --> 23:36.065
I did not expect that.
Crescent-shaped scar.

23:36.066 --> 23:39.468
Looks like there was some truth
to Mickey's tale after all.

23:43.381 --> 23:46.048
His name is
Anton Francis. Mr. Francis here,

23:46.049 --> 23:48.450
not wanting to waste
such a sinister looking scar

23:48.451 --> 23:50.352
decide to round out
the stereotype

23:50.353 --> 23:52.354
with a laundry list
of criminal activity,

23:52.355 --> 23:53.755
including
fencing stolen property,

23:53.756 --> 23:55.757
stickups
and a smash and grab.

23:55.758 --> 23:56.592
Do we have time of death?

23:56.593 --> 23:58.793
Yes, between 1:00
and 4:00 am this morning,

23:58.993 --> 24:00.061
Which rules out
Mickey Carlson.

24:00.162 --> 24:02.130
We verified that he stayed in
a homeless shelter last night.

24:02.131 --> 24:03.631
So if Mickey
was telling us the truth,

24:03.731 --> 24:05.000
then Doug and Mr. Francis

24:05.001 --> 24:07.069
clearly got more
than they bargained for.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.104
All by the murderous hand
of their partner--

24:09.505 --> 24:11.506
The guy who killed Doug
with the syringe--

24:11.507 --> 24:14.108
Our mysterious 3rd man.

24:14.509 --> 24:17.677
Let's get photos of all of Anton's
known associates and former cell mates.

24:17.778 --> 24:20.746
If Mickey saw his face, he should be able
to I.D. him for us.

24:20.947 --> 24:22.816
So how does a man
like Douglass Bishop--

24:22.817 --> 24:24.051
with no criminal record--

24:24.052 --> 24:25.720
get involved
with hardened criminals?

24:25.821 --> 24:27.922
Simple.
They needed him.

24:28.523 --> 24:30.858
It seemed convenient to me that
the Maitlands were out of town

24:30.859 --> 24:32.627
when all this went down,
so I did some digging.

24:33.128 --> 24:34.662
Turns out
that cruise they're on,

24:34.663 --> 24:36.130
they won it in a contest.

24:36.231 --> 24:38.699
Only there is no contest.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
A phony award letter?

24:40.101 --> 24:41.934
Yeah, when they got that
and the tickets,

24:41.935 --> 24:43.937
they figured, why look
a gift horse in the mouth.

24:43.938 --> 24:45.641
So guess where the tickets
came from.

24:46.542 --> 24:47.942
Doug Bishop's travel agency.

24:48.042 --> 24:49.312
So the cruise
was just a scam

24:49.313 --> 24:50.914
to get the Maitlands
out of town.

24:51.215 --> 24:53.382
The letter says that
the cruise had to be this week.

24:53.383 --> 24:55.417
Why this week?
And why the Maitlands?

24:55.418 --> 24:57.887
Well, unless our bad guys
are into prewar architecture,

24:57.888 --> 24:59.855
there's really nothing in that
apartment that's worth anything

24:59.856 --> 25:01.423
except for
the audio/visual equipment,

25:01.424 --> 25:03.458
which was still there.
Why go through so much trouble

25:03.459 --> 25:05.194
to get
in the Maitlands' apartment?

25:05.195 --> 25:08.196
Maybe what they wanted wasn't
in the Maitlands' apartment.

25:08.197 --> 25:10.365
Maybe they were gonna rob
someone else,

25:10.366 --> 25:12.333
but just needed access.

25:12.334 --> 25:15.103
The audio/visual equipment.

25:15.104 --> 25:16.738
Access.

25:16.739 --> 25:20.140
The Maitlands live
on the second floor.

25:20.341 --> 25:20.875
Running perpendicular to them
and whatever's below

25:22.876 --> 25:24.908
is the old dumbwaiter shaft.

25:25.109 --> 25:27.209
In "Gathering Storm,"
I had Derrick Storm

25:27.210 --> 25:29.941
climb up the dumbwaiter shaft
to bypass the Czech assassin

25:29.942 --> 25:31.375
in order to save
the Swiss ambassador's daughter.

25:32.476 --> 25:34.077
Maybe our bad guys
are using the dumbwaiter

25:34.178 --> 25:36.180
to bypass the security
of whatever's below them.

25:36.681 --> 25:39.048
Which would explain the ropes
and the climbing gear.

25:39.649 --> 25:42.815
So what's below
the Maitlands' apartment?

25:43.816 --> 25:44.615
A pet shop.

25:45.316 --> 25:47.516
Why don't you come down
and have a look at them?

25:47.517 --> 25:50.485
I have the largest selection
of reptiles in the city.

25:50.486 --> 25:52.152
They're my specialty.

25:52.153 --> 25:53.787
My pleasure.

25:53.788 --> 25:56.623
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

25:56.624 --> 26:00.226
Ah, how is it?
Can I, uh, can I help you?

26:00.227 --> 26:02.227
And you're sure
nothing was stolen?

26:02.228 --> 26:05.396
Ya. I mean,
what is there to steal?

26:06.998 --> 26:09.266
This dumbwaiter has been
opened recently.

26:09.267 --> 26:11.234
It was open?

26:11.235 --> 26:14.203
Mickey told us his attacker said
there was millions at stake.

26:14.204 --> 26:15.240
Mr. Du Preez, what's on
the other side of that wall?

26:15.241 --> 26:17.541
28th street.
Eastside Bank and Trust.

26:17.941 --> 26:19.474
A bank heist.

26:19.475 --> 26:21.976
It looks like the plan was to
cut into the back wall

26:21.977 --> 26:23.574
to get into the bank vault
on the other side.

26:23.575 --> 26:25.108
We called the bank manager,
the FBI,

26:25.109 --> 26:27.012
but our guys never made it
that far.

26:27.113 --> 26:28.013
What went wrong?

26:28.713 --> 26:31.547
We don't know.
It could've been greed, panic.

26:31.548 --> 26:35.183
It looks like our victims might
have been betrayed by their partner.

26:35.285 --> 26:37.320
In the old days, you killed your partners
after you got the money.

26:37.921 --> 26:39.289
Any leads on this,
uh, third man?

26:39.290 --> 26:41.590
No. We had our squatter
take a look at mug shots

26:41.690 --> 26:44.457
of Anton Francis' associates,
and we didn't find him.

26:44.458 --> 26:46.459
What if the connection
to the third man

26:46.460 --> 26:48.227
isn't through scar face?
What if it's through Doug?

26:48.228 --> 26:49.896
The travel agent? I thought
we went through him.

26:49.897 --> 26:53.165
We did. We checked his family,
his friends, his coworkers.

26:53.166 --> 26:54.199
But not his clients.

26:54.200 --> 26:55.401
Think about it.
Maybe that's it.

26:56.202 --> 26:58.503
The third man books a trip
through Doug.

26:58.804 --> 27:01.605
Doug starts talking,
tells him about his dream

27:01.606 --> 27:03.407
of owning a scuba shop
in the islands.

27:03.508 --> 27:05.843
The third man senses
his frustration. That's his in.

27:06.244 --> 27:08.479
He tells Doug it'll be easy.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.215
It's a victimless crime,
nobody will get hurt,

27:10.216 --> 27:11.649
Insurance will pay,

27:12.350 --> 27:14.684
knowing the whole time,
if the police investigate,

27:14.685 --> 27:17.254
they'll track the tickets back
through to Doug, not to him.

27:17.755 --> 27:19.789
The third man remains invisible
so long as Doug is dead.

27:19.890 --> 27:21.290
That almost makes sense.

27:21.990 --> 27:24.391
Let's run Doug's client list
for the past six months.

27:24.392 --> 27:26.026
If anything pops,
we'll show it to Mickey.

27:26.027 --> 27:27.027
Okay.

27:27.227 --> 27:28.795
You know,
maybe I should cancel tonight.

27:28.996 --> 27:30.296
You're gonna cancel
on the guy

27:30.396 --> 27:32.197
that risked his life
for a bunch of puppies?

27:32.198 --> 27:33.798
Sir, you know about my date?

27:33.998 --> 27:36.066
Yes, and--and despite
what you might think,

27:36.067 --> 27:37.668
the world's not gonna end

27:37.669 --> 27:38.738
just because you disappear
for a night.

27:38.839 --> 27:41.807
And if it does, I'm sure
that those two can handle it.

27:43.008 --> 27:45.076
Yeah. Go ahead.
Yeah, I need the overtime.

27:46.177 --> 27:47.879
Okay, but call me
if anything turns up.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Have fun.

27:51.080 --> 27:52.948
You see how ready she was
to cancel on that date?

27:53.749 --> 27:54.617
What's it to you,
Castle?

27:54.818 --> 27:56.118
Yeah, why do you care?

27:56.418 --> 27:58.351
I'm just sayin'.
Look out 'cause, uh...

28:04.655 --> 28:06.622
Neither of those.

28:06.623 --> 28:07.889
Hmm?

28:07.890 --> 28:11.092
Mm. Look.

28:11.093 --> 28:13.093
Oh, you're good.

28:13.194 --> 28:14.161
Hey...

28:14.162 --> 28:17.063
I know that this can be
weird for you,

28:17.164 --> 28:19.598
How parents
aren't supposed to date.

28:19.599 --> 28:20.699
I know you date, dad.

28:21.099 --> 28:21.899
I know you probably
do other things

28:21.900 --> 28:23.500
that I am not
going to think about,

28:23.501 --> 28:25.668
and that we'll never,
ever mention.

28:26.169 --> 28:28.403
Fair enough.
So... what's wrong?

28:29.804 --> 28:30.870
I don't know.

28:30.871 --> 28:32.306
I mean, I'm not gonna
be here forever.

28:32.407 --> 28:34.041
and then who's gonna
look after you then,

28:34.642 --> 28:35.842
Bachelorette number 3?

28:35.843 --> 28:38.044
Slow down there.

28:38.445 --> 28:40.379
Let's not go buying rings
anytime soon.

28:40.380 --> 28:41.847
It's just a date.
I know.

28:41.848 --> 28:44.848
And she seems nice and all,
but... if that's who you date,

28:44.849 --> 28:46.250
I mean, are you really
gonna find happiness

28:46.251 --> 28:48.252
with the kind of person
who's a number on a list?

28:48.953 --> 28:49.853
Well, I already have.

28:50.953 --> 28:52.288
You're number one on mine.

28:53.789 --> 28:55.356
Look, it's my job
to worry about you,

28:55.357 --> 28:56.690
not the other way around.

28:57.091 --> 28:58.892
I'll be fine.
Yeah.

28:58.993 --> 29:01.494
That's what you said when you
tried to deep-fry a turkey.

29:01.895 --> 29:03.463
And we all know
how that turned out.

29:04.064 --> 29:06.031
I just don't want you
to get hurt...

29:06.532 --> 29:10.067
or burn your eyebrows off...
Again.

29:10.068 --> 29:13.836
♪

29:13.837 --> 29:15.471
I'm glad they grew back.

29:16.372 --> 29:17.773
They're finally matching.

29:26.347 --> 29:28.984
I've heard this place
is impossible to get into.

29:28.985 --> 29:29.689
Excuse me.

29:29.690 --> 29:32.191
Ricky.
Frankie! Come here.

29:32.192 --> 29:33.994
It's nice to see you again.
And you.

29:34.595 --> 29:36.162
Um, your table
will be ready momentarily.

29:36.163 --> 29:37.364
Castle?

29:41.000 --> 29:42.169
Beckett?

29:44.373 --> 29:47.041
I take it you two know each other?
Uh, yeah.

29:47.042 --> 29:49.411
Brad, this is Richard Castle.
We work together.

29:49.412 --> 29:51.712
Uh, Amanda, this is
Kate Beckett. We work together.

29:51.812 --> 29:53.913
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

29:53.914 --> 29:55.648
Ah.
What are you doing here?

29:55.649 --> 29:56.751
You knew
that I was coming here.

29:56.752 --> 29:58.152
I knew you wanted
to come here.

29:58.252 --> 29:59.853
I didn't think you could get
a table last-minute.

29:59.854 --> 30:01.154
You got a table last-minute.

30:01.354 --> 30:02.423
Yeah. I've got connections.

30:02.424 --> 30:04.824
So do I.
City Health Inspector.

30:04.924 --> 30:07.358
Wow.
Nice abuse of power.

30:07.659 --> 30:09.593
So, Richard,
you a cop, too?

30:09.594 --> 30:11.562
No. He's a novelist
who's been shadowing me

30:11.563 --> 30:12.632
on my murder cases.

30:12.633 --> 30:14.333
Oh, I do a little more
than shadowing.

30:15.033 --> 30:16.767
Your table is ready.

30:21.203 --> 30:22.770
So you two working
a homicide?

30:22.771 --> 30:24.138
Um, a double homicide.

30:24.139 --> 30:27.208
It's actually a rather tricky
case because the killer is...

30:27.209 --> 30:29.410
I like to call him
the third man.

30:29.411 --> 30:31.745
Very mysterious. It sounds
like one of your books.

30:31.746 --> 30:33.346
Yeah, it kinda does.

30:33.347 --> 30:35.415
Anyway,
he and his two partners...

30:35.416 --> 30:37.316
Were gonna rob a bank,

30:37.516 --> 30:39.251
only he turned on the other two
and killed them

30:39.252 --> 30:41.185
before they even finished
the job.

30:41.186 --> 30:42.754
I mean, it doesn't
even make any sense.

30:42.755 --> 30:44.622
Usually you'd wait
until you got the money

30:44.623 --> 30:46.024
before you double-crossed
your partners.

30:46.025 --> 30:47.725
I mean, they didn't even
have the right equipment

30:47.725 --> 30:48.826
to rob a bank.

30:48.827 --> 30:50.627
Well, I'm sure you'll
figure it out eventually.

30:50.927 --> 30:52.294
You know, speaking of
great mysteries,

30:52.295 --> 30:54.396
I saw an incredible play
off broadway the other night.

30:54.497 --> 30:55.497
I just wish I could figure out

30:55.597 --> 30:56.930
what they were doing
with the ketamine.

30:57.631 --> 30:59.166
Maybe it had something to do
with the pet store.

31:01.167 --> 31:02.734
You gonna eat that?

31:02.735 --> 31:05.136
It's not like there was really
anything to steal there.

31:05.137 --> 31:08.272
Unless the pet store was just
a front for something else.

31:10.607 --> 31:12.777
Waiter. Could I have
another glass of wine, please?

31:12.778 --> 31:14.781
In which case, the owner
might have been lying

31:14.782 --> 31:16.083
when he said that nothing
was stolen.

31:17.984 --> 31:19.284
You want to have sex
with me later?

31:19.384 --> 31:20.987
I'm sorry. Would you mind
if I made a telephone call?

31:21.788 --> 31:22.788
Nah.

31:22.588 --> 31:23.688
Thanks.

31:26.358 --> 31:30.059
Um... the bathrooms are up
by the front, right?

31:30.060 --> 31:32.661
Pardon me.

31:35.230 --> 31:36.065
Have you got something?

31:36.466 --> 31:37.966
I was just having
Ryan and Esposito

31:38.066 --> 31:38.833
run something down for me.

31:38.834 --> 31:39.934
The pet shop.

31:40.034 --> 31:41.303
Yes! How did you know?

31:41.304 --> 31:42.904
I was thinking
the exact same thing

31:43.004 --> 31:44.338
It's probably
a front for something.

31:44.339 --> 31:45.239
Okay, so they're gonna dig up

31:45.339 --> 31:46.273
everything they can
on the owner.

31:46.274 --> 31:47.508
It could be
that he's hiding something.

31:47.509 --> 31:48.509
Right.

31:49.609 --> 31:51.344
Well, I should get back
to this date.

31:51.345 --> 31:52.345
How's yours going?

31:52.445 --> 31:54.145
Great. Yours?
Fantastic.

31:54.146 --> 31:56.614
Well, I'll, uh, see you.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.882
The pheasant is amazing.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.954
I'm sorry.
That's the station.

32:06.955 --> 32:08.623
Yeah. Go ahead.

32:09.892 --> 32:11.627
Would you pardon me?

32:11.628 --> 32:14.529
Bathroom again?

32:22.768 --> 32:23.769
So what'd they find out?

32:23.770 --> 32:24.704
Yo.

32:24.705 --> 32:26.639
We ran the pet shop owner--
Noel du Preez.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.507
He came up clean.
Really?

32:28.508 --> 32:30.642
What about in the past
couple of days?

32:30.743 --> 32:32.677
Anything unusual?
The day before yesterday,

32:32.778 --> 32:34.512
customs has him
taking possession

32:34.613 --> 32:37.280
of a half a dozen
African gray parrots,

32:37.281 --> 32:39.015
four baboon spiders

32:39.216 --> 32:41.316
and two black-tailed pythons,

32:41.317 --> 32:42.418
all from South Africa.

32:42.419 --> 32:43.519
Wait a minute. Did you--

32:44.219 --> 32:46.753
Did you say black-tailed pythons
from South Africa?

32:47.154 --> 32:49.221
Yeah. Why?
Because black-tailed pythons,

32:49.322 --> 32:50.856
also know as Indian Rock pythons,

32:50.857 --> 32:52.193
are not indigenous
to that area.

32:52.194 --> 32:53.496
Why would they be coming
from Africa?

32:53.897 --> 32:55.597
Why do you care about
some motherfreaking snakes

32:55.697 --> 32:56.531
on a motherfreaking plane?

32:56.932 --> 32:58.532
Because as a murder mystery
novelist,

32:58.632 --> 33:00.500
I am highly paid
to think like a bad guy.

33:00.501 --> 33:03.070
Here are a few fun facts
about snakes.

33:03.271 --> 33:05.473
They are cold-blooded,
they swallow huge amounts,

33:05.474 --> 33:08.175
and they digest their food
very slowly.

33:08.276 --> 33:09.278
Perfect for smuggling.

33:09.279 --> 33:10.479
And it wouldn't be
the first time.

33:10.579 --> 33:11.947
If these snakes are coming in
from South Africa...

33:12.848 --> 33:15.182
there are two things in
abundance in South Africa--

33:15.683 --> 33:17.919
Racial hatred and diamonds.

33:18.020 --> 33:20.556
Smuggling diamonds
in live snakes.

33:20.557 --> 33:22.757
Mickey's attacker said that
there were millions at stake.

33:22.857 --> 33:24.659
And the dumbwaiter goes
right down into the pet store.

33:24.760 --> 33:26.661
That's why the Maitlands' trip
had to be this week.

33:26.762 --> 33:29.296
They knew the shipment was
coming in. And the ketamine--

33:29.297 --> 33:30.097
was to dope the snakes

33:30.097 --> 33:31.898
so they could take 'em
up the shaft without a fight,

33:31.899 --> 33:32.700
and then when we came
to the store--

33:32.701 --> 33:33.801
the owner couldn't say a word,

33:33.701 --> 33:35.536
otherwise he'd implicate himself
in smuggling.

33:35.537 --> 33:36.637
So we find out
who robbed him--

33:36.737 --> 33:37.738
We find the third man.

33:37.739 --> 33:39.939
Do they know they're finishing
each other's sentences?

33:40.639 --> 33:43.006
Have uniforms pick up the owner.
We'll meet you at the store.

33:45.307 --> 33:47.241
Hey, is this seat taken?

33:47.442 --> 33:48.642
What should we tell them?

33:48.643 --> 33:49.811
This is gonna be awkward.

33:52.912 --> 33:54.179
They'll be okay.

34:04.956 --> 34:06.123
Is the owner in custody?

34:06.124 --> 34:07.391
Wife said he was here
working late.

34:07.492 --> 34:08.393
Place looks closed.

34:08.393 --> 34:10.393
Okay, Castle,
hold my purse.

34:11.194 --> 34:12.527
Follow me.

34:22.436 --> 34:24.005
Ready? Let's go.

34:30.641 --> 34:32.243
Room all clear.

34:32.344 --> 34:33.645
Here too.

34:34.047 --> 34:35.647
Whoa!

34:35.848 --> 34:38.181
NYPD!
drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon!

34:38.283 --> 34:40.551
drop the gun!
Drop your weapon!
Drop the gun!

34:40.552 --> 34:42.786
Drop the gun!
Get down! Down!

34:45.255 --> 34:46.956
Hey. You okay?

34:47.058 --> 34:47.958
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.326
It takes a lot more
than that to scare me.

34:50.127 --> 34:51.728
What about a big,
hairy spider on your shoulder?

34:51.730 --> 34:53.530
Yeah, that would do it.

35:00.975 --> 35:02.475
I didn't know
you were the police.

35:03.376 --> 35:04.877
I have a right
to defend my store.

35:04.878 --> 35:07.313
Defend from who,
Mr. du Preez?

35:07.314 --> 35:08.782
According to customs,

35:08.783 --> 35:12.184
you took possession
of two black-tailed pythons.

35:13.185 --> 35:14.287
Which is not a crime.

35:14.288 --> 35:17.055
No, but black-tailed pythons
are indigenous to India.

35:17.056 --> 35:19.424
So why ship them in
from South Africa?

35:19.525 --> 35:20.658
My suppliers are there.

35:21.459 --> 35:23.061
There's nothing illegal
about my business.

35:23.362 --> 35:24.497
Then where are the snakes?

35:24.898 --> 35:25.931
They weren't in the store,

35:26.032 --> 35:28.534
And we didn't find any invoices
indicating that they were sold.

35:28.835 --> 35:29.636
You know what we did find?

35:30.037 --> 35:33.273
A color grader, a UV  lamp
and a carat weight scale.

35:33.274 --> 35:34.374
All tools
of the diamond trade.

35:34.474 --> 35:36.308
So what happened,
Mr. du Preez?

35:36.709 --> 35:39.143
Because we think
someone broke into your store,

35:39.244 --> 35:40.844
came down the dumbwaiter shaft

35:40.845 --> 35:42.612
and stole your shipment
of diamonds.

35:43.813 --> 35:44.714
Now that's your problem.

35:44.715 --> 35:47.550
My problem is that they left
two bodies behind.

35:51.686 --> 35:53.688
Okay, fine. You don't want
to implicate yourself.

35:53.689 --> 35:54.256
I get it.

35:54.457 --> 35:57.459
I'm simply gonna ask,
who knew about the shipment?

36:00.460 --> 36:02.628
Come on, Mr. du Preez.
Don't you want us to find them?

36:02.629 --> 36:04.564
Who knew?
Who did you tell?

36:04.565 --> 36:05.565
I told no one.

36:05.665 --> 36:06.300
Mr. du Preez--

36:06.301 --> 36:08.301
I picked up my cargo
at the airport personally,

36:09.201 --> 36:10.569
And I locked 'em
in my office.

36:13.570 --> 36:14.504
The next day,
they were gone.

36:18.809 --> 36:20.310
Do you recognize
either of these men?

36:21.511 --> 36:24.513
No. I've never seen
any of them in my life.

36:25.114 --> 36:26.481
It's the truth.

36:26.582 --> 36:29.484
Robbing a smuggler.
It's almost a perfect crime.

36:29.685 --> 36:31.386
The victim
can't go to the police

36:31.387 --> 36:33.122
without admitting
his own crime.

36:33.223 --> 36:35.357
Someone knew that shipment
was coming in.

36:35.458 --> 36:36.826
Someone had it planned.

36:38.127 --> 36:39.628
Where are we
on Doug's client list?

36:39.629 --> 36:42.263
We ran every client
Doug ever had, and we got nada.

36:42.264 --> 36:44.530
Just to be thorough, we showed
their D.M.V. photos to Mickey.

36:45.031 --> 36:46.797
None of them were
our mysterious third man.

36:46.898 --> 36:49.265
Well, it had to be someone
du Preez would never expect.

36:49.266 --> 36:51.567
Someone connected to
his pet store in some capacity,

36:51.868 --> 36:53.068
an old employee perhaps?

36:53.069 --> 36:54.872
He would have to know when
the shipment was coming in.

36:54.873 --> 36:57.373
Yeah, someone who knew
his timetable.

36:58.374 --> 37:01.109
Maybe someone du Preez had sent
to the airport previously

37:01.110 --> 37:03.344
to pick up a shipment.
Out to the airport.

37:03.445 --> 37:04.113
What was that?

37:04.214 --> 37:06.314
Run all of the paperwork
from du Preez's last shipment--

37:06.414 --> 37:09.583
Customs, fish and wildlife,
shipping company, everything.

37:09.684 --> 37:11.153
I want to know
who knew what and when.

37:11.154 --> 37:12.354
You think
someone at the airport

37:12.454 --> 37:14.088
caught on
to du Preez's smuggling,

37:14.189 --> 37:15.658
Decided to rob him
instead of report him?

37:15.659 --> 37:17.959
Not only that.
I think I know who.

37:19.259 --> 37:21.393
Mr. And Mrs. Kopek,
thank you for coming in so late.

37:21.394 --> 37:22.329
Please.

37:23.230 --> 37:24.330
Oh, sorry it took so long.

37:24.430 --> 37:25.630
Stan was at work
when you called.

37:25.631 --> 37:26.731
Oh, right.

37:27.232 --> 37:29.834
You said that the last time
that you saw your brother

37:29.835 --> 37:32.737
was at the agency's party
around where Stan works?

37:32.738 --> 37:33.738
That's right.

37:34.638 --> 37:35.939
Could you refresh my memory,
Mr. Kopek?

37:36.040 --> 37:37.007
Where is it that you work?

37:37.308 --> 37:38.308
It--it's late.

37:38.508 --> 37:40.209
Could--could you just please
tell us what you found out?

37:40.610 --> 37:43.378
Well, I didn't really
put everything together

37:43.379 --> 37:44.379
until I remembered

37:44.480 --> 37:46.781
your wife's story
about the party

37:47.582 --> 37:49.084
at the airport.

37:50.085 --> 37:51.019
What's this?

37:51.620 --> 37:53.554
It's a customs form,
Mr. Kopek,

37:54.055 --> 37:55.789
authorizing the release
of cargo

37:55.790 --> 37:57.690
to a Mr. Noel du Preez,

37:57.691 --> 37:59.092
signed by you.

37:59.393 --> 38:02.160
Yeah. So?
I-I work for customs.

38:02.161 --> 38:03.661
What's--
what's the big deal?

38:04.062 --> 38:05.196
What's going on, Stan?

38:05.297 --> 38:07.198
I have no idea.
Sure you do.

38:07.299 --> 38:09.733
When you realized
what Mr. du Preez was doing--

38:09.934 --> 38:11.734
Smuggling diamonds--
you said to yourself,

38:11.835 --> 38:14.336
"why should I give him up
to those ungrateful bastards?

38:14.437 --> 38:16.572
Why not just take care of it myself?"
Stan--

38:16.673 --> 38:17.708
then all you needed to do

38:17.709 --> 38:20.142
was pull the import permits
from fish and wildlife

38:20.143 --> 38:21.511
to determine when
the next shipment would be.

38:22.512 --> 38:25.546
But you needed someone
with connections

38:25.547 --> 38:26.747
to fencing stolen goods.

38:26.748 --> 38:29.283
And so you contacted
Anton Francis--

38:29.384 --> 38:31.217
A con man
and an old high school buddy

38:31.218 --> 38:33.352
who'd been in and out of jail
for years.

38:33.653 --> 38:36.255
The easy score
was money to his ears,

38:36.256 --> 38:37.791
but you needed to get
the Maitlands out of town

38:37.792 --> 38:39.297
for a couple of days first.

38:39.298 --> 38:41.398
And that's when your
brother-in-law Doug came in.

38:41.498 --> 38:42.498
What did you do, Stan?

38:43.399 --> 38:46.367
Did you play on his dreams,
tell him he could finally afford

38:46.368 --> 38:47.739
that scuba shop
he always wanted?

38:48.340 --> 38:50.440
Stan, what did you do?

38:50.540 --> 38:51.507
Nothing. Nothing.
I-I don't know--

38:51.608 --> 38:53.975
Mrs. Kopek, your husband
killed your brother.

38:54.176 --> 38:55.679
That's ri--
Stan...

38:55.680 --> 38:57.415
They're lying. That's--
that's ridiculous.

38:57.416 --> 38:59.616
We have a witness,
Mr. Kopek.

39:00.116 --> 39:01.116
The squatter
you tried to kill

39:01.217 --> 39:02.552
identified you
from a photo array

39:02.653 --> 39:04.587
less than an hour ago.

39:05.088 --> 39:06.188
Oh, God.

39:06.288 --> 39:08.989
No, no, it was--it wasn't
supposed to happen like this.

39:09.090 --> 39:10.391
N-no one
was supposed to get hurt.

39:10.492 --> 39:13.559
I mean, Doug--he just--
he wouldn't listen.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.028
And I-I didn't mean...

39:15.129 --> 39:17.797
And--and Anton,
he came after me.

39:17.898 --> 39:20.767
He--that was self-defense.
I'm not--I'm not a killer.

39:20.768 --> 39:22.435
We have two bodies
that prove otherwise.

39:23.636 --> 39:27.403
It just got out of hand.
Things just spun out of control.

39:27.404 --> 39:29.304
Get him away from me.
Honey, it's--

39:32.107 --> 39:34.372
On your feet.

39:36.107 --> 39:37.708
I did it for us.

39:39.177 --> 39:41.277
It was all for us, baby.

39:41.278 --> 39:42.845
This way.

39:44.348 --> 39:46.982
And you guys thought
I made the whole thing up.

39:46.983 --> 39:48.451
I believed you
the whole time.

39:50.152 --> 39:51.619
So what--what happens
to me now?

39:51.820 --> 39:52.921
I'll go back
to the holding cell

39:52.922 --> 39:53.990
or am I headed to the tombs?

39:53.991 --> 39:56.291
Neither. For your cooperation
in the apprehension

39:56.391 --> 39:58.726
of Stan Kopek,
the A.D.A. Has agreed to a deal.

39:59.027 --> 40:00.895
Five years probation
for all your sins.

40:01.096 --> 40:01.996
No jail time?

40:02.196 --> 40:03.831
You have a shot
at a second chance, Mickey.

40:03.832 --> 40:04.832
Don't blow it.

40:05.232 --> 40:08.866
I won't.
Hey, thanks for everything.

40:09.167 --> 40:10.901
Really, thank you.
All right.

40:14.571 --> 40:15.872
Whew.

40:15.873 --> 40:17.974
Oh, man.
I can't wait to go home

40:17.975 --> 40:19.876
and just slip into a warm bath and--
I--

40:19.977 --> 40:22.543
Don't. Please don't.

40:22.644 --> 40:26.079
I was just going to say,
I'm starving.

40:26.080 --> 40:27.281
We left the restaurant
before I had a chance

40:27.282 --> 40:27.849
to finish my entree.

40:27.950 --> 40:29.350
Oh yeah. Well, it wouldn't
have mattered if you did.

40:30.250 --> 40:32.417
The portions there were tiny.
Ugh.

40:33.118 --> 40:34.918
You know,
Remy's is open all night.

40:34.919 --> 40:36.320
They've got those burgers...

40:36.421 --> 40:37.955
Oh, and those shakes...

40:44.160 --> 40:45.796
Oh, why not?
Mm.

40:48.301 --> 40:50.302
So how did your date go?

40:50.303 --> 40:52.303
She was kind of boring.

40:52.304 --> 40:54.305
Didn't talk much.
Oh.

40:54.306 --> 40:56.307
Mr. July?

40:56.308 --> 40:58.775
A little self-absorbed.
Looked it.

40:58.776 --> 41:00.777
Really?
You can tell.

41:00.778 --> 41:03.779
Some people just don't know
how  behave on a date.

41:03.780 --> 41:06.015
Especially on a first date.
Exactly.
