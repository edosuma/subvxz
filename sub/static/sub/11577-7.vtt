[BO narrating]
Last time on Lost Girl:

00:07.175 --> 00:09.211
[DYSON] I found this
symbol on all of their bodies.

00:09.427 --> 00:10.633
It's a triskele.

00:10.845 --> 00:13.427
[BO] Three humans. All killed
in the elevator crash.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.175
And then possessed
by some kind of Fae.

00:15.391 --> 00:16.096
What can I get you?

00:16.309 --> 00:16.923
Coquetel.

00:17.143 --> 00:20.180
The Ancients called this drink
the drink of prophecy.

00:20.396 --> 00:22.637
It's my husband.
He died a few weeks ago.

00:22.857 --> 00:23.687
[ALICIA] I saw him.

00:23.900 --> 00:24.514
Hello again.

00:24.734 --> 00:25.849
Well, you just keep popping up.

00:26.068 --> 00:29.026
Everything is gonna go boom.

00:29.238 --> 00:30.774
[BO] You're
feeding off the crowd.

00:31.824 --> 00:32.779
[TRICK] The Ancients
are the most powerful

00:32.992 --> 00:34.948
Fae family that ever lived.

00:36.495 --> 00:46.496
[sirens]

00:54.430 --> 00:59.970
[distant helicopter]

01:00.186 --> 01:19.653
[groans and yelling]

01:19.872 --> 01:25.287
[WOMAN moaning]

01:25.503 --> 01:26.492
[BO] Over here.

01:26.712 --> 01:31.422
[WOMAN moaning]

01:31.634 --> 01:33.090
[yelling]

01:33.302 --> 01:34.337
--[BO] Dyson.
--[WOMAN] Please help us!

01:34.553 --> 01:35.258
[WOMAN] Please!

01:35.471 --> 01:36.756
Hasn't every annoying
person ever told you,

01:36.973 --> 01:38.634
lift with your legs.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.181
[DYSON] Way to make
light of a heavy situation.

01:44.105 --> 01:48.018
[WOMAN] Oh my god. Go.
Go, go. Go, go, go, go, go.

01:48.567 --> 01:49.818
[WOMAN] Thank--Thank you.

01:50.027 --> 01:52.143
[WOMAN grunting]

01:52.363 --> 01:53.853
[BO] Here.
Give me your hand.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.278
[BO] You're okay.

02:05.126 --> 02:06.161
[TAMSIN] Tornado's headed east.

02:06.377 --> 02:08.083
I've got ambulances
in the safe zone on Fifth.

02:08.296 --> 02:10.207
[DYSON] Good work.
I'll take care of them.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.169
Looks like a
battlefield out here.

02:14.385 --> 02:15.841
[TAMSIN] And I've seen my share.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.259
Shit got real.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.678
I have never seen
anything like this.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.176
As long as we're together,
we can take on anything.

02:22.393 --> 02:23.803
You're my girl.

02:24.020 --> 02:24.884
Tamsin.

02:25.104 --> 02:26.514
Yeah, girl?

02:27.440 --> 02:28.395
Never mind.

02:28.607 --> 02:36.696
[distant sirens]

02:44.081 --> 02:45.161
Oh my gods.

03:03.768 --> 03:07.681
Oh Pythia, Dedona, Cassie!

03:07.897 --> 03:11.230
[ZEE] Come on! Up!

03:11.442 --> 03:14.275
It's almost time.

03:14.487 --> 03:17.695
Look alive oracles.

03:17.907 --> 03:20.319
Oraclettes.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.492
My little eyeless wonders.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.319
hhundeﬂ

03:40.346 --> 03:41.756
[ALL gasp]

03:45.434 --> 03:48.141
[ORACLES] Only in the
darkness can we see the light.

03:48.354 --> 03:50.845
Only in the darkness
can we see the light.

03:51.065 --> 03:54.057
Ready. Set.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.268
Bo.

03:57.488 --> 04:02.482
[opening theme]

04:03.577 --> 04:06.034
[NEWS ANCHOR] The wind is
constant and more rain is forecast.

04:06.247 --> 04:09.239
And lightning continues to
touch down across the city.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.915
Meteorologists are
still stumped as to why

04:12.128 --> 04:14.289
there are no warnings
and so far,

04:14.505 --> 04:17.622
no explanation for this
bizarrely localized storm.

04:17.842 --> 04:19.503
The department of safety
is urging the public

04:19.718 --> 04:22.710
to remain indoors
until further notice.

04:22.930 --> 04:23.885
Apocalypse anyone?

04:24.098 --> 04:25.963
Sounds like somebody's
trying to send us a message.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.013
Oh, good.
'Cause we're not equipped

04:27.226 --> 04:28.011
for the end of the world.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.012
[SAM] Even with Cassie missing,

04:29.228 --> 04:30.809
we only have room
for one more patient.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.522
How about three?

04:32.731 --> 04:33.686
Give me the four-one-one.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.355
The Ancients are behind this.

04:35.568 --> 04:36.728
We saw their symbol.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.480
What? The same ones that
were on the victims' bodies?

04:38.696 --> 04:39.151
Exactly.

04:39.363 --> 04:40.648
And now a mark from the storm.

04:40.865 --> 04:42.275
Like a big ass crop circle.

04:42.491 --> 04:43.321
[TAMSIN] At least we
know they aren't subtle.

04:43.534 --> 04:44.865
[DYSON] Yeah, but we
still can't find them.

04:45.077 --> 04:45.862
I'm workin' on it.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.614
Hey, whaddya say we
go sweep the streets?

04:47.830 --> 04:49.570
Make sure no one's left behind.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.654
It's okay. Go, go, go.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.240
[SAM] Doctor L.,
I need you, stat.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.700
And about ten more of ya.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.125
I'm worried that someone's
gonna use this chaos

04:55.337 --> 04:58.500
to try and take Lauren's serum.

04:58.716 --> 05:00.752
I'll stay. You guys be careful.

05:02.511 --> 05:03.887
[TAMSIN] Bye.

05:04.096 --> 05:12.014
[commotion]

05:12.229 --> 05:15.517
[WOMAN screams]

05:15.733 --> 05:16.518
About that apocalypse?

05:16.734 --> 05:17.849
[LAUREN] Okay, you know what?
Don't anybody panic.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.808
We have everything
completely under control.

05:20.029 --> 05:21.565
[MALE NURSE] No, well, get
'em down there right now.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.190
[FEMALE NURSE]
Everybody stay calm.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.649
You were saying?

05:26.869 --> 05:28.655
It's Evony's cryo-box.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.912
[MARK] O-ho.
Yes. I love storms.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.867
[VEX] Ughhh... Enthusiasm.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.462
[water dropping]

05:37.671 --> 05:39.582
[TRICK] Uh. Bucket!

05:43.636 --> 05:46.799
Zeus was so frustrated
with the humans' impiety,

05:47.014 --> 05:49.801
that he flooded the
Earth to destroy mankind.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.132
[TRICK] He used
Hera's messenger,

05:51.352 --> 05:53.934
Iris the Rainbow God,
to do it.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.647
Wait, wait, wait. Lemme
get something straight.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.266
When you say "god"
you actually mean...?

05:57.483 --> 06:01.317
Fae... so powerful
that a long time ago,

06:01.529 --> 06:02.393
[TRICK] humans worshiped them.

06:02.613 --> 06:05.025
Whoa, hold the lift. If Zeus
and his Ancient bunch

06:05.241 --> 06:06.856
are wreakin' havoc
on our colony's skies,

06:07.076 --> 06:10.113
why am I stuck here
in Cheers with you lot?

06:10.329 --> 06:11.944
[VEX] I feel like I've
picked the worst lane

06:12.164 --> 06:15.201
in the shittiest
traffic of all time.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.247
Fickle.

06:16.460 --> 06:19.543
hhundeﬂ

06:19.755 --> 06:20.710
Get me some candles?

06:20.923 --> 06:22.288
[VEX] Oh, by all means.

06:22.508 --> 06:25.545
I love takin' orders from
the man with the leaky roofs.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.798
And the piss sticky floors!

06:31.600 --> 06:33.386
Wha--? I-I mop, I swear.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.649
[VEX] Well, if it's
the end of the world...

06:42.861 --> 06:45.819
I may as well get tipsy.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.441
Wa-ha-ha.

06:52.371 --> 06:53.952
Oh, that's lovely.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.039
Surprise.

06:58.252 --> 06:59.913
Um, surprise, yes.

07:00.129 --> 07:02.586
hhundeﬂ

07:02.798 --> 07:05.039
Man, I really do love storms.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.045
Yeah, so we've heard.

07:08.137 --> 07:10.594
You do know Trick is gonna
blame me for that, right?

07:10.806 --> 07:13.138
Eh...

07:13.350 --> 07:15.432
All right, then.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.350
We don't wanna get
you in trouble now,

07:17.563 --> 07:19.394
do we, Danny Zuko?

07:19.607 --> 07:21.017
C'mon, let's go.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.688
Is the weather
effectin' your noggin'?

07:25.904 --> 07:28.065
Atmospheric pressure
or something?

07:28.741 --> 07:30.106
| feel great.

07:30.326 --> 07:33.363
[VEX] M'kay. Good then.
Let's go and get candles.

07:33.579 --> 07:35.035
[MARK] What kind do you want?

07:35.247 --> 07:35.906
[VEX] Um...

07:36.123 --> 07:38.705
Thick or... long?

07:38.917 --> 07:39.747
[chuckles]

07:39.960 --> 07:42.121
Ideally a little bit
of both, actually.

07:47.468 --> 07:50.084
Where're you...?

07:50.304 --> 07:52.465
Oh, that.

07:53.390 --> 07:53.970
No, no, no--

07:54.183 --> 07:55.343
[zipper unzips]

07:55.559 --> 07:56.969
But yes.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.262
Oh, l--l d--

08:01.482 --> 08:04.474
I don't think your father
would be too pleased if he knows

08:04.693 --> 08:08.151
what you're taking
at the moment. Oh...

08:10.032 --> 08:13.490
Oh... sweet storm.

08:13.702 --> 08:16.193
That feels...

08:16.413 --> 08:17.823
wrong.

08:24.421 --> 08:27.128
That's so wrong.

08:27.341 --> 08:33.758
Do you know Dyson despises every
fiber of my wretched being?

08:33.972 --> 08:35.257
[MARK] You talk too much.

08:35.474 --> 08:36.884
Yeah, well--

08:43.399 --> 08:45.355
If I were a god,
where would I be?

08:45.567 --> 08:48.434
[TAMSIN] Duh. Big fluffy
white cloud in the sky.

08:48.654 --> 08:50.315
Do you have any cream cheese?

08:50.531 --> 08:52.396
[BOTH chuckle]

08:52.616 --> 08:54.572
[DYSON]
You smell good wet.

08:54.785 --> 08:58.073
[TAMSIN]
Yeah I do. Thanks.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.243
Streets are under control.

08:59.456 --> 09:00.992
Surprisingly no fatalities.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.290
Then why unleash a tornado?

09:03.502 --> 09:05.709
[TAMSIN] Mmm. Maybe
it's not about the tornado.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.582
Maybe it's about the aftermath.

09:07.798 --> 09:09.004
Destruction, chaos.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.127
Blackout. And not the wake
up on a Saturday morning

09:11.343 --> 09:12.332
at the Four Seasons kind.

09:12.553 --> 09:15.215
I rechecked our human
body's residence. Empty.

09:15.431 --> 09:16.420
So is the PR firm.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.222
Well, I did find this.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.684
[DYSON]
Alicia must've put these up.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.936
I asked her to leave town.

09:29.153 --> 09:31.394
She saw her supposedly
dead husband walking around

09:31.613 --> 09:34.355
after he died
in an elevator crash.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.440
I wouldn't leave town if
I was her; I'd want answers.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.161
She's human. I can't
just say his body was

09:38.370 --> 09:40.486
taken over by an Ancient.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.617
[DYSON] I need you to wipe
the city clean of any evidence

09:42.833 --> 09:45.575
of the gods, their
symbols, those posters.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.750
Whatever you can find.

09:47.963 --> 09:49.248
I'm gonna go check the clinic.

09:49.465 --> 09:50.079
Tamsin.

09:50.299 --> 09:51.789
I am not jealous of Lauren.

09:54.970 --> 09:59.259
Bo's a Succubus. There's always
gonna be other people.

09:59.475 --> 10:00.965
It's in her nature.

10:01.185 --> 10:03.722
It's not the other people
that I'm worried about.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.973
It's just the one.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.359
Hey, where're you going?

10:13.572 --> 10:15.528
[DYSON] To see about a girl.

10:19.912 --> 10:22.119
[beeping]

10:22.331 --> 10:23.946
[LAUREN] Come on!
This thing's on a generator

10:24.166 --> 10:25.576
that has its own
backup generator.

10:25.793 --> 10:26.999
That's on a backup generator?

10:27.211 --> 10:29.122
How? How is it
not enough power?

10:29.338 --> 10:31.579
Uh, with Evony,
nothing is ever enough.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.505
Oh... Please tell me
this thing is about to

10:33.717 --> 10:36.959
unleash a lifetime
supply of froyo.

10:37.179 --> 10:38.965
Try one of the oldest,
most dangerous Fae

10:39.181 --> 10:40.671
to ever walk the Earth.

10:40.891 --> 10:43.303
Lovely. What do we do?

10:43.519 --> 10:46.431

Evacuate. Evacuate.
Evacuate. Evacuate.

10:50.192 --> 10:51.352
Evacuate it is.

Evacuate. Evacuate.

Evacuate. Evacuate. Evacuate.

Robot voice lady
can shut the Fae up.

11:00.619 --> 11:01.483
[LAUREN] Sam's
getting everybody out

11:01.703 --> 11:02.909
and ambulances
are routing patients

11:03.121 --> 11:04.531
to the nearest hospitals.

Evacuate. Evacuate. Evacuate.

All my life.

11:18.887 --> 11:23.927

11:34.319 --> 11:35.104
Huh...?

11:35.320 --> 11:38.687
[LAUREN] | see your
"huh" and I raise you--

11:38.907 --> 11:40.693
are you freaking kidding me?

11:46.290 --> 11:49.498
Evony Fleurette Marquise,
I despise you.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.496
Yet you continue
to work for her.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.419
All of this is for her.
To make her Fae again.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.498
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

12:04.683 --> 12:09.677
[soulful song begins]

12:09.897 --> 12:11.137
Don't you think we should
save the generator power

12:11.356 --> 12:13.062
for something more important?

12:20.073 --> 12:23.065
She could be listening.

12:23.285 --> 12:25.526
[LAUREN]
I know what I'm doing.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.953
You need to trust me.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.791
[LAUREN] I'm getting
to live my lifelong dream.

12:33.003 --> 12:36.666
Treating humans. Fae.
Conducting research.

12:36.882 --> 12:42.127
And none of this has anything to
do with turning Evony Fae again.

12:42.346 --> 12:44.883
[LAUREN] I don't work
for anybody but myself.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.804
[BO] You know how
to seize an opportunity.

12:47.017 --> 12:53.434
[LAUREN] Mmm. Well, for
some of us, life is shorter.

12:53.649 --> 12:55.355
[BO] Then let's make it count.

12:55.567 --> 13:05.568
[music continues]

13:22.260 --> 13:23.716
[knock on door]

13:25.222 --> 13:27.463
[footsteps]

13:33.271 --> 13:34.397
Can I help you?

13:34.606 --> 13:35.561
What are you doing here?

13:35.774 --> 13:38.811
[ALICIA] Kevin. Who is it?

13:42.447 --> 13:45.063
[ALICIA] Detective Dyson.

13:45.283 --> 13:48.025
[HERATIO]
Oh, you know him?

13:48.245 --> 13:50.611
[DYSON] I was, uh,
assigned to your case.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.072
I thought I'd check in.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.031
Your department told me I
couldn't see Kevin's body

13:55.252 --> 13:56.583
because it was too damaged.

13:56.795 --> 13:58.001
They handed me an urn.

13:58.213 --> 14:01.046
My husband's supposed ashes were
sitting on my fireplace mantle.

14:01.258 --> 14:05.342
[HERATIO] Sh, shhh, shh.

14:05.554 --> 14:07.090
I appreciate your
concern, Detective,

14:07.305 --> 14:09.637
but as you can see,
I'm home safe.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.637
[HERATIO] No thanks to you and
your department, I might add.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.138
So where were you?

14:15.605 --> 14:18.096
Well, I woke up on
the side of highway six

14:18.316 --> 14:20.523
and I stumbled around
until I got my bearings

14:20.736 --> 14:24.274
and then... found Alicia.

14:26.575 --> 14:30.067
Do you mind if I come inside
and take your statement?

14:30.287 --> 14:33.700
Well, we were in the
middle of making hot cocoa.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.040
Well, I'd love some.

14:38.253 --> 14:43.919
[indie pop song plays]

14:44.134 --> 14:45.670
Bo?

14:45.886 --> 14:47.092
Lauren?

14:47.304 --> 14:48.464
Soul singer?

14:48.680 --> 15:06.520
[indie pop song continues]

15:06.740 --> 15:07.320
[WOMAN 1] Surprised?

15:07.532 --> 15:08.612
[WOMAN 2] I couldn't believe it.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.076
[MARK] Hey.
Help me unload again?

15:10.285 --> 15:11.741
[VEX spits out drink]

15:11.953 --> 15:13.079
I beg your pardon?

15:13.288 --> 15:15.370
Come on, man. Just give
me a quick hand.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.447
Now? Right here?

15:17.667 --> 15:18.952
I'm sorry. Are there
other dishes to unload

15:19.169 --> 15:21.000
somewhere in the future
that I don't know about?

15:21.213 --> 15:22.544
Oh, oh. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:22.756 --> 15:25.498
Dishes. Yeah, I could
certainly help you with that.

15:25.717 --> 15:28.629
Yeah, I thought you were
referring to the, uh, you know.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.927
The thing that
happened in the keg room.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.014
Bobbing for candles.

15:35.227 --> 15:36.808
hhundeﬂ

15:37.020 --> 15:39.056
Ugh, I need another drink.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.478
[EVONY] It's on me.

15:40.690 --> 15:44.148
Wow. Dim lights does
wonders for this crowd.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.101
Except for you.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.403
Your eyes still look sunken in.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.823
[VEX] Mark, meet Evony,
whose only redeeming feature

15:52.035 --> 15:53.491
is her filthy rich husband.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.568
Mmm. Means I should
get a good tip then.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.996
Speaking of tips,
what bronzer do you use?

15:58.208 --> 16:00.449
[EVONY] It is so Saint Tropez.

16:00.669 --> 16:02.205
I'm sorry. What's bronzer?

16:02.420 --> 16:03.205
Dyson's offspring.

16:03.421 --> 16:05.582
[EVONY] Hm. Explains the face.

16:05.799 --> 16:11.294
J'adore storms. Now that
I'm human, they make me feel so...

16:11.513 --> 16:13.378
mmm, quivery.

16:15.809 --> 16:18.346
Not over role playing
are we Mrs. Robinson?

16:22.149 --> 16:24.356
you wouldn't be over it either.

16:27.279 --> 16:30.897
Mesmer me shocked.
You have a crush on Teen Wolf.

16:31.116 --> 16:33.152
This is Fae territory.
You're not meant to be here.

16:33.368 --> 16:36.075
Oh Vex. Once Fae, always Fae.

16:36.288 --> 16:39.496
Now put your little Wellies on.
We're going singing in the rain.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.244
I don't take orders
from you anymore.

16:41.459 --> 16:42.960
I need you.

16:43.170 --> 16:46.128
Power outage means
you-know-what is on the loose.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.749
[sighs]

16:47.966 --> 16:49.126
Has he killed the Monopoly Man?

16:49.342 --> 16:54.427
Hubby and his monocle are safe.
I had it stored at my clinic.

16:54.639 --> 16:58.723
Oh, you want to gain
control over your little serum.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.020
And Lauren?

17:01.229 --> 17:06.849
What she doesn't see
will most definitely hurt her.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.480
[indie pop song plays]

17:09.696 --> 17:12.483
| wish we could
lie here forever.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.914
Well...

17:20.123 --> 17:24.366
Since tonight is about
seizing the moment,

17:24.586 --> 17:29.205
why don't I pop open my
Chateau Mouton Rothschild.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.507
I have no idea
what you just said.

17:32.719 --> 17:42.720
[indie pop song continues]

17:50.695 --> 17:53.812
Oh, hey. I didn't
know you were back.

17:54.032 --> 17:56.114
Ah, we were just, um.

17:58.328 --> 17:59.738
Sam?

18:02.958 --> 18:04.368
Sam?

18:05.794 --> 18:07.204
Sam?

18:09.047 --> 18:19.890
[intense music]

18:20.100 --> 18:21.840
He's dead.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.927
Evony wasn't lying after all.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.432
[BO] There is a monster.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.059
And it's invisible.

18:32.612 --> 18:36.901
And I was like,
"I must be dreaming."

18:37.117 --> 18:38.857
There he was.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.989
[ALICIA]
Standing outside my door.

18:42.205 --> 18:44.787
The man I
fell in love with.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.161
Who I thought died.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.673
All right. Kevin.

18:55.885 --> 18:59.252
How 'bout I take your statement?
For the police record.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.805
In your own words,
what exactly happened?

19:03.018 --> 19:03.848
Well, like I said,

19:04.060 --> 19:06.312
I don't know
what happened or...

19:06.521 --> 19:07.476
where I had been.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.680
I just woke up on a side street.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.935
I thought you said highway.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.359
Yes, yes. Highway seven.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.607
Uh. He means six.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.233
[chuckles]

19:18.450 --> 19:21.738
You have to forgive me,
I'm still a bit out of it.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.486
Excuse me.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.166
I know who you are.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.873
Well then you'll know
to keep your distance.

19:37.093 --> 19:41.257
Murders. Kidnapping oracles.
Destroying the city.

19:41.473 --> 19:44.215
This all stops. Tonight.

19:44.434 --> 19:47.141
I'm not done playing house yet.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.647
[ALICIA'S footsteps]

19:52.859 --> 19:58.604
Oh, god. Marshmallows.
I love these little things.

19:58.823 --> 20:02.691
So, what were
you two talking about?

20:02.911 --> 20:05.869
Mmm. Well.

20:06.081 --> 20:12.293
I was jsut telling
Dyson, here, how...

20:12.504 --> 20:13.960
I'm about to kill you.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.287
[ALICIA gasps]

20:15.507 --> 20:16.747
[DYSON] Let her go!

20:16.966 --> 20:18.706

20:18.927 --> 20:20.508

20:20.720 --> 20:23.962
My name is Hera.

Gadflies.
Always a crowd pleaser.

20:36.569 --> 20:40.107
Now. Where were we?

20:40.323 --> 20:42.689
Oh, yes. Kill her.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.586
I'll be back for yours.

[LAUREN]
First Lisa. Now Sam.

21:18.153 --> 21:20.314
[BO] Hey.
This was not your fault.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.816
[LAUREN]
I know, I know, I know.

21:23.032 --> 21:23.862
I haven't felt this guilty since

21:24.075 --> 21:26.452
my Karen Beattie days.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.777
[BO] Seriously? Now?

21:28.997 --> 21:30.908
You choose now to tell me
about your former identity?

21:31.124 --> 21:33.240
It--It's the trauma.
It ixnays my filter.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.620
[BO] Hey, I'll take
whatever I can get.

21:34.836 --> 21:37.327
Karen Beattie all over me.

21:37.547 --> 21:41.335
[LAUREN] It was a long time ago.
People died. It was my fault.

21:41.551 --> 21:44.167
[BO] I guess we have more
in common than I thought.

21:46.264 --> 21:49.427
Lauren, you need to go.
I'll take care of this.

21:49.642 --> 21:50.802
I'm not leaving you alone.

21:51.019 --> 21:51.974
It is too dangerous.

21:52.187 --> 21:54.599
Bo, look. I may not be
as strong as you and Tamsin,

21:54.814 --> 21:57.146
[LAUREN] but that
doesn't mean I can't fight.

22:01.863 --> 22:03.854
I'm not scared anymore.

22:11.206 --> 22:14.573
[DYSON] You sure you
don't wanna stay at a hotel?

22:14.792 --> 22:17.499
If you don't mind,
I'd feel safer here.

22:17.712 --> 22:19.418
hhundeﬂ

22:19.631 --> 22:21.917
It's a little lacking
on charm, but...

22:22.133 --> 22:23.748
stay as long as you'd like.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.592
Dyson .

22:33.811 --> 22:38.180
[ALICIA] I know you saw it too.

22:38.399 --> 22:41.015
What happened?

22:41.236 --> 22:43.318
He's not Kevin anymore.

22:43.530 --> 22:46.237
Then who is he?

22:46.449 --> 22:49.657
What is he?

22:49.869 --> 22:51.825
I don't know.

22:52.539 --> 22:53.949
[sniffs]

22:57.126 --> 22:59.538
But I'll help you find out.

22:59.754 --> 23:02.791
[ALICIA sighs] I think
I need to lie down.

23:03.007 --> 23:04.508
Okay.

23:17.272 --> 23:19.809
You get some rest.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.936
[DYSON] Everything's always
better in the morning, right?

23:23.152 --> 23:25.188
Yeah.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.145
[ALICIA] Thank you.

23:45.842 --> 23:47.503
Bo.

23:47.719 --> 23:51.553
Shhh. She's sleeping.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.345
[BO] She's pretty.

23:55.351 --> 23:57.728
Who is she?

23:57.937 --> 24:01.179
A human that needs protection.

24:01.399 --> 24:04.891
Strange. I can usually smell
you coming from a mile away.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.897
Do I not smell like me?

24:09.282 --> 24:11.694
Yeah, you do.

24:11.909 --> 24:13.945
Must be the storm.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.410
Can I tell you a secret?

24:20.627 --> 24:22.709
I didn't think we had any.

24:25.381 --> 24:28.669
I think about you.

24:28.885 --> 24:30.716
Every day.

24:33.431 --> 24:34.796
I think about you too.

24:35.016 --> 24:37.507
I just can't be
with you right now.

24:37.727 --> 24:39.388
I know.

24:39.604 --> 24:41.344
[DYSON] Same old game.

24:41.564 --> 24:44.226
Well, maybe it's time
you change your rules.

24:46.194 --> 24:49.857
Gotta say, this is
a bit of a curve ball.

24:50.073 --> 24:51.984
I'll give you a curve ball.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.565
[grunts]

24:53.785 --> 24:54.820
Not attractive?

24:55.036 --> 24:56.742
No, a bit more
on the painful side.

24:56.954 --> 24:58.364
[BOTH chuckle]

24:58.581 --> 25:00.196
[DYSON] Shhh.

25:00.416 --> 25:01.201
She's sleeping.

25:01.417 --> 25:04.250
I'll be quiet.

25:04.462 --> 25:06.418
Can't promise you'll be.

25:17.517 --> 25:20.054
Even if you find
your little serum,

25:20.269 --> 25:21.099
[VEX] don't you think
you're still gonna need

25:21.312 --> 25:22.893
Doctor Boring
to help you with it?

25:23.106 --> 25:25.188
[EVONY] She's not helping me,
she's using me.

25:25.400 --> 25:26.264
And I let her
because I thought

25:26.484 --> 25:27.974
I didn't have a choice.

25:28.194 --> 25:31.903
Now, I'm taking
things into my own

25:32.115 --> 25:34.822
rapidly wrinkling
human hands.

25:35.034 --> 25:39.027
And uh, do you know
another doctor that treats Fae?

25:39.247 --> 25:42.535
I will find one.
A witch. A druid.

25:42.750 --> 25:45.617
[EVONY] A sorcerer with
a rope for a belt if I have to.

25:45.837 --> 25:47.998
[VEX] What is that?

25:48.214 --> 25:48.999
[gaSPSI

25:49.215 --> 25:50.716
Is that a skin tag?

25:50.925 --> 25:51.755
[laughs]

25:51.968 --> 25:56.086
See?! This is precisely why I
need to be Fae again. Skin tags!

25:56.305 --> 26:01.845
[distant crash]

26:02.061 --> 26:05.849
If it gets close,
you remember what to do.

26:06.065 --> 26:09.023
How could I forget?
It's how you and I met.

26:10.987 --> 26:16.323
Yeah. You were a
shattered little mess.

26:16.534 --> 26:20.277
[EVONY] Yes, yes.
I know. You saved me.

26:20.496 --> 26:23.033
Now get off your
half-ass and help me.

26:24.709 --> 26:27.291
[EVONY] Of course
the serum's behind a bush.

26:27.503 --> 26:28.959
When will I learn?

26:29.172 --> 26:31.504
Vex?

26:31.716 --> 26:33.957
Vex!

26:34.177 --> 26:35.917
You looking for something?

26:36.137 --> 26:37.502
Give.

26:37.722 --> 26:39.963
Your monster killed one of my
doctors and you have the nerve

26:40.183 --> 26:42.265
to come in here and
try and steal my work?

26:42.477 --> 26:45.514
When that thing finds us,
it's going to eat you both alive

26:45.730 --> 26:49.268
and then use me as a toothpick.
'Cause I'm the skinniest.

26:49.484 --> 26:52.191
We are done taking shots
in the dark here, Evony.

26:52.403 --> 26:54.189
How do we stop this thing
before it does any more damage?

26:54.405 --> 26:56.066
[EVONY] Nothing
on this Earth can kill it.

26:58.659 --> 27:01.275
Not even, Lumberbutch over here.

27:05.875 --> 27:06.830
I have an idea.

27:07.043 --> 27:08.954
What?

27:09.170 --> 27:10.580
What?!

27:12.715 --> 27:14.797
[BO] How are
your throwing skills?

27:15.009 --> 27:18.126
Uh, it's at an eighty two
percent. On a good day.

27:18.346 --> 27:19.882
[BO] Good enough.

27:20.097 --> 27:23.931
The question is,
what does it want most?

27:27.438 --> 27:28.723
Oh, no.

27:28.940 --> 27:30.555
Oh, yes.

27:30.775 --> 27:33.642
You don't know what
you're dealing with.

27:33.861 --> 27:35.647
And I'm not talking
invisible monster.

27:35.863 --> 27:37.979
With the Ancients back,
we are all ground meat.

27:38.199 --> 27:39.814
Steak freakin' tartar.
And hold the capers

27:40.034 --> 27:41.399
because there won't
be time for condiments.

27:41.619 --> 27:43.029
Oh, what a bunch
of dusty old Fae.

27:43.246 --> 27:44.736
What makes you think
they're so dangerous?

27:44.956 --> 27:47.163
[EVONY] I don't think, I know.

27:47.375 --> 27:48.615
[BO] How?

27:48.835 --> 27:50.120
I used to date one.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.452
[ORACLES] Only in the
darkness can we see the light.

27:52.672 --> 27:55.254
Only in the darkness
can we see the light.

27:55.466 --> 27:58.048
Only in the darkness
can we see the light.

28:02.139 --> 28:05.927
[EVONY] Sure. I don't mind being
the dangling freaking carrot.

28:06.143 --> 28:09.180
Rain is great for my human hair.

28:09.397 --> 28:11.888
[sighs]
What are you waiting for?

28:15.152 --> 28:17.313
[EVONY]
Come and get me!

28:20.783 --> 28:24.822
For the love of
Mike Nichols. Now!

28:25.037 --> 28:26.652
[growl in the distance]

28:26.873 --> 28:28.454
[EVONY] Oh, come on.
I had to share a room

28:28.666 --> 28:30.281
with my sisters growing up.

28:30.501 --> 28:32.457
At least you got your own.

28:33.629 --> 28:34.163
Now.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.540
[LAUREN grunts]

28:35.756 --> 28:38.133
[monster growls]

28:45.516 --> 28:49.134
You kept me in
the dark for so long.

28:49.353 --> 28:51.139
It was your turn.

28:52.857 --> 28:55.815
I was a big girl, Eros.

28:56.027 --> 28:58.814
[EVONY] You should've just
told me how you really felt.

28:59.030 --> 29:03.899
Instead of stringing
me along. Humiliating me.

29:04.118 --> 29:05.528
[sniffs]

29:09.040 --> 29:11.782
I loved you.

29:12.001 --> 29:15.539
And you chose
that doormat, Psyche.

29:28.726 --> 29:30.967
And I hate to lose.

29:31.687 --> 29:33.097
[EVONY] Ah!

29:59.382 --> 30:02.374
Did she say Eros?
As in Greek God?

30:02.593 --> 30:04.424
Zeus' lightning.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.844
Takes the power of an
Ancient to kill an Ancient.

30:07.056 --> 30:09.843
I guess everybody has
their monsters. Even Evony.

30:19.110 --> 30:19.724
Trick.

30:19.944 --> 30:20.899
[TRICK] Isabeau.

30:21.112 --> 30:25.731
It's so good to
see you. In fine form.

30:25.950 --> 30:28.783
I miss you too much.

30:28.995 --> 30:31.407
I've been fooled
like this before.

30:31.622 --> 30:34.614
It's different
this time. It's true.

30:34.834 --> 30:38.952
I'm true. We'll be
together again.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.581
Soon.

30:40.798 --> 30:42.959
What do you mean "soon"?

30:44.010 --> 30:46.501
Holy orgy, Trick.

30:46.721 --> 30:50.384
This isn't real. This isn't you.

30:50.599 --> 30:51.554
[CASSIE]
You are not the light.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.428
Only in the darkness
can we see the light.

30:53.644 --> 30:55.555
[ORACLES] Only in the
darkness can we see the light.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.727
Only in the darkness
can we see the light.

30:57.940 --> 30:59.976
Only in the darkness
can we see the light.

31:00.192 --> 31:04.356
[ORACLES continue]

31:06.782 --> 31:08.238
Trick, you all right?

31:08.451 --> 31:12.660
Has anybody else had an unusual
interaction with someone today?

31:12.872 --> 31:16.865
[TRICK] Something,
perhaps sexual in nature?

31:20.504 --> 31:22.415
That's what I feared.

31:22.631 --> 31:23.916
[TRICK] Oracle visions.

31:24.133 --> 31:26.294
What do the visions mean?

31:26.510 --> 31:29.547
They're trying to... arouse us.

31:29.764 --> 31:33.177
So they can get close to
our lips and extract our truth.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.759
But these visions,
they're just a ruse, right?

31:36.979 --> 31:40.471
Not quite. Within each vision,
the oracles are required

31:40.691 --> 31:44.479
to deliver truth in
order to extract truth.

31:44.695 --> 31:47.903
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
I didn't see Kate Upton today.

31:48.115 --> 31:50.231
I mean, why didn't these
oracles try to get up on me?

31:50.451 --> 31:53.113
Yeah, why us? I mean,
what've I got in common

31:53.329 --> 31:55.820
with Trick and Frack, here?

31:56.040 --> 32:00.534
Bo. Her blood.
It's in each of us.

32:00.753 --> 32:03.995
When we bound ourselves
to her to defeat the Garuda?

32:04.215 --> 32:07.298
"Only in the darkness
can they see the light."

32:07.510 --> 32:09.922
The light is Bo's blood.

32:10.137 --> 32:13.220
Yeah, that storm wasn't
meant to flood the Earth.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.172
They simply wanted
a power outage.

32:15.392 --> 32:18.099
[DYSON] So the oracles
could see what they needed to.

32:18.312 --> 32:20.428
If Bo is the light,
at least we kept them

32:20.648 --> 32:22.513
off her track for a while.

32:22.733 --> 32:25.645
[TRICK] Zeus is known for
giving oracles their vision.

32:25.861 --> 32:28.193
He sent them.

32:28.405 --> 32:30.782
He wants her truth, but why?

32:30.991 --> 32:33.448
Heh. How do these,
uh, oracles, you know,

32:33.661 --> 32:34.901
choose who they appear as?

32:35.121 --> 32:37.032
I mean, it's just random, right?

32:37.248 --> 32:39.204
You know, theyjust
pick a name out of a hat?

32:39.416 --> 32:41.327
[TRICK]
Oracles are all knowing, Vex.

32:41.544 --> 32:45.662
They appear to us as the
person our heart most desires.

32:47.591 --> 32:52.381
Why? Who'd you see?

32:52.596 --> 32:54.132
[sighs]

33:10.322 --> 33:12.574
Tamsin? Are you home?

33:33.262 --> 33:35.127
Any luck finding the Ancients?

33:35.347 --> 33:39.807
No. I was looking for you.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.431
[DYSON] Sometimes
it feels that's all I do.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.730
What is that supposed to mean?

33:49.028 --> 33:53.146
[DYSON] You chose
me first for a reason.

33:53.365 --> 33:59.076
Everything we've gone through.
Everything we've sacrificed.

33:59.288 --> 34:02.576
That was love.

34:02.791 --> 34:05.624
[DYSON] And it's still there.

34:05.836 --> 34:07.997
It doesn't go away.

34:08.214 --> 34:15.757
No, it doesn't. But it changes.

34:15.971 --> 34:19.179
It does.

34:19.391 --> 34:23.930
But know that I will
always be there for you.

34:24.146 --> 34:29.015
I am strong for you.

34:29.235 --> 34:34.400
Dyson, why all this now?

34:34.615 --> 34:36.606
Because now is all we have.

34:36.825 --> 34:39.783
Whoa. Wait.

34:39.995 --> 34:42.111
I'm pretty sure I was
just talking to Dyson.

34:42.331 --> 34:45.915
Oh, Bo. You're tired.
We both are.

34:46.126 --> 34:48.503
[LAUREN] I think the blackout's
gotten the best of all of us.

34:48.712 --> 34:49.997
This isn't real.

34:50.214 --> 34:54.548
[LAUREN]
It's true, Bo. I'm true.

34:54.760 --> 34:55.624
As long as we're alive,

34:55.844 --> 34:57.175
as long as we're
walking the Earth,

34:57.388 --> 34:59.800
we can't not be together.

35:04.853 --> 35:07.595
Looks like Lauren.

35:07.815 --> 35:09.771
Smells like Lauren.

35:09.984 --> 35:14.478
I even taste like me.
Give it a try.

35:15.531 --> 35:21.652
hhundeﬂ

35:21.870 --> 35:23.997
[MAN] Don't be afraid.

35:27.710 --> 35:29.496
Dad?

35:39.722 --> 35:41.132
[TRICK] Enough!

35:49.023 --> 35:50.308
What was that?

35:50.524 --> 35:53.891
The Ancients sent
them for your truth.

35:54.111 --> 35:56.568
What do they want
with my granddaughter?

36:04.580 --> 36:06.571
My father is Hades.

36:11.211 --> 36:12.587
That's not possible.

36:12.796 --> 36:15.003
[BO] He took Aife
from the dark dungeons

36:15.215 --> 36:16.341
and brought her to Tartarus.

36:16.550 --> 36:20.668
I saw where I was
born, Trick. In Hell.

36:21.430 --> 36:24.092
Persephone, my stepmother, she told me

36:24.308 --> 36:25.889
to take that candle
from my father.

36:26.101 --> 36:29.059
[BO] She told me to
light it for her family.

36:30.981 --> 36:35.190
What if lighting it
brought them here?

36:35.402 --> 36:37.643
And it caused the
elevator to crash...

36:37.863 --> 36:41.947
allowing them to take
over human vessels.

36:42.159 --> 36:44.696
It's time for us to meet
the other side of the family.

36:53.045 --> 36:55.707
[ZEE] Took you long enough.

36:55.923 --> 36:57.333
[CASSIE gasps]

37:01.678 --> 37:03.088
She has it.

37:05.182 --> 37:09.425
She has it.
She doesn't even know.

37:13.607 --> 37:16.940
You've chained me. Used me.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.108
[CASSIE] Showed me things that
made me take out my own eyes.

37:19.321 --> 37:22.358
I have given you
everything you asked for.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.906
Now please, let me go.

37:29.081 --> 37:31.072
Okay.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.498
You can go.

37:33.710 --> 37:36.622
[CASSIE screaming]

37:42.302 --> 37:42.336
So.

37:42.344 --> 37:44.881
So.

37:45.097 --> 37:46.177
Why did you leave Evony?

37:46.390 --> 37:49.052
[chuckles]

37:49.268 --> 37:50.929
Eh...

37:54.022 --> 37:57.856
Well, she had to face
the music once and for all.

37:58.068 --> 37:59.478
Eros broke her heart.

38:01.530 --> 38:04.021
And instead of dealing
with it all those years ago,

38:04.241 --> 38:06.027
I helped lock him up.

38:06.243 --> 38:09.610
And she's been her
evil self ever since.

38:09.830 --> 38:12.196
So, she's the one
you saw in your vision?

38:14.376 --> 38:15.786
[h uffs]

38:19.965 --> 38:21.250
Who was it then?

38:21.467 --> 38:23.128
Who does your heart desire most?

38:23.343 --> 38:24.628
[chuckles]

38:24.845 --> 38:26.426
My heart's been
locked and chained

38:26.638 --> 38:29.505
and dropped to the
deepest, darkest ocean.

38:33.270 --> 38:36.854
Eh, I haven't got a bloody clue
what my heart wants anymore.

38:41.737 --> 38:43.193
[sighs]

38:43.822 --> 38:46.313
Let Dyson and
Tamsin know I'm okay.

38:46.533 --> 38:49.115
Just need some time
alone to process all this.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.698
Bye Lauren.

38:52.915 --> 38:54.325
[beep]

38:55.918 --> 38:57.909
Hey, should I leave you alone?

38:58.128 --> 39:02.121
No, Tamsin. You live here.
I didn't mean you.

39:02.341 --> 39:03.751
Okay.

39:06.553 --> 39:08.168
Are you okay?

39:08.388 --> 39:12.301
Um... Not really.

39:16.563 --> 39:19.054
We need to talk.

39:19.274 --> 39:22.562
Bo, |--| know what
you're gonna say and um...

39:22.778 --> 39:25.269
I just want you to know
that I'm okay with it.

39:25.489 --> 39:27.901
As hard as that is,
I'm okay with it.

39:29.952 --> 39:31.738
You are?

39:31.954 --> 39:33.660
Yeah.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.614
You're a Succubus.
Y'know, you're gonna need

39:36.833 --> 39:38.789
to sleep with other people.

39:39.002 --> 39:42.711
[TAMSIN] Even if those
people happen to be Lauren.

39:44.049 --> 39:47.792
I know where your
heart truly lies.

39:48.011 --> 39:49.512
It's with me.

39:52.641 --> 39:55.223
[TAMSIN] | just need
you to say it once so I know.

40:02.693 --> 40:04.524
Tamsin...

40:06.280 --> 40:09.317
[BO] I care about you.

40:09.533 --> 40:12.275
More than you know.

40:12.494 --> 40:13.574
But?

40:13.787 --> 40:16.449
And I know it seems
like we're a couple,

40:16.665 --> 40:20.078
because we live together
and we take cases together--

40:20.294 --> 40:21.875
And we sleep together.

40:22.087 --> 40:25.250
Look, Tamsin.
I think that deep down,

40:25.465 --> 40:28.047
you feel the same way.

40:28.260 --> 40:33.721
Don't patronize me.
I'm wise beyond my lives.

40:33.932 --> 40:36.469
Don't tell me I'm making this
up. Don't tell me I'm stupid.

40:36.685 --> 40:39.301
I'm not. I'm just saying that...

40:39.521 --> 40:41.682
living with someone
and being close to them

40:41.898 --> 40:44.230
all the time, it's...

40:47.321 --> 40:49.312
It can be confusing.

40:49.531 --> 40:52.773
[TAMSIN]
I am not confused.

40:52.993 --> 40:55.279
I'm not.

40:55.495 --> 40:57.406
I'm in love with you.

40:58.457 --> 41:05.044
Tamsin. I love you. I do.

41:07.883 --> 41:09.589
[BO] But not like that.

41:13.013 --> 41:14.549
[BO] I'm sorry.

41:18.560 --> 41:22.724
So, Lauren's good enough.

41:22.939 --> 41:25.021
[TAMSIN]
Dyson's good enough.

41:25.233 --> 41:28.100
Even Rainer is good enough.

41:28.320 --> 41:31.357
What's wrong with me?
Why not me?

41:31.573 --> 41:33.404
[TAMSIN crying]
What's wrong with me?

41:33.617 --> 41:38.702
There is nothing wrong with you.

41:38.914 --> 41:41.997
[sniffs]

41:42.209 --> 41:45.121
You know,
I though that finally...

41:45.337 --> 41:48.170
[TAMSIN] in my last life
that I'd found the one.

41:51.677 --> 41:53.838
Your eyes are both
brown and blue.

41:57.808 --> 41:59.548
[sniffs]

41:59.768 --> 42:01.304
[sighs]

42:03.230 --> 42:07.394
--[BO] Tamsin.
--[TAMS|N] Don't follow me.

42:07.609 --> 42:09.691
--[BO] Tamsin.
--[TAMS|N] Don't!

42:15.200 --> 42:16.940
[door slams shut]

42:17.160 --> 42:27.161
[dream pop song plays]

42:52.571 --> 42:58.237
[distant sirens]

43:04.583 --> 43:09.577
[dream pop song continues]
