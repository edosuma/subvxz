01:09.736 --> 01:12.105
<i>Sometimes,
I think I'm cursed.</i>

01:12.108 --> 01:15.740
<i>Because of something that
happened before I was even born.</i>

01:15.742 --> 01:19.094
<i>See, a long time ago,
there was this family.</i>

01:20.248 --> 01:23.115
<i>The</i> papa, <i>he was a musician.</i>

01:23.117 --> 01:26.968
<i>He and his family would sing and
dance and count their blessings.</i>

01:28.124 --> 01:31.757
<i>But he also had a dream.
To play for the world.</i>

01:34.661 --> 01:37.130
<i>And one day,</i>

01:37.133 --> 01:41.133
<i>he left with his guitar
and never returned.</i>

01:49.409 --> 01:51.144
<i>And the</i> mama...

01:51.147 --> 01:53.813
<i>She didn't have time to cry
over that walk-away musician.</i>

01:56.283 --> 02:01.255
<i>After banishing all music from
her life she found a way...</i>

02:01.257 --> 02:02.871
<i>to provide for her daughter.</i>

02:06.694 --> 02:10.162
<i>She rolled up her sleeves
and she learned to make shoes.</i>

02:15.336 --> 02:17.602
<i>She could have made candy,</i>

02:17.604 --> 02:20.705
<i>or fireworks,
or sparkly underwear...</i>

02:20.707 --> 02:26.026
<i>for wrestlers,
but no, she chose shoes.</i>

02:28.582 --> 02:30.898
<i>Then she taught her daughter
to make shoes.</i>

02:32.288 --> 02:34.869
<i>And later,
she taught her son-in-law.</i>

02:35.858 --> 02:37.858
<i>Then her grandkids
got roped in.</i>

02:39.495 --> 02:42.510
<i>As her family grew,
so did the business.</i>

02:43.866 --> 02:46.781
<i>Music had torn
her family apart.</i>

02:47.569 --> 02:49.917
<i>But shoes held
them all together.</i>

02:51.472 --> 02:53.239
<i>You see, that woman was</i>

02:53.241 --> 02:55.789
<i>my great-great-grandmother,</i>
Mama <i>Imelda.</i>

02:56.778 --> 02:59.612
<i>She died
way before I was born.</i>

02:59.614 --> 03:01.781
<i>But my family
still tells her story</i>

03:01.783 --> 03:04.350
<i>every year
on</i> Dia de los Muertos...

03:04.352 --> 03:05.851
<i>the Day of the Dead.</i>

03:05.854 --> 03:07.752
<i>And her little girl,</i>

03:07.754 --> 03:10.204
<i>she's my great-grandmother,</i>
Mama <i>Coco.</i>

03:10.892 --> 03:12.793
<i>Hola, Mama</i> Coco.

03:12.795 --> 03:15.329
How are you, Julio?

03:15.331 --> 03:17.495
<i>Actually, my name is Miguel.</i>

03:17.497 --> 03:21.335
Mama <i>Coco has trouble
remembering things.</i>

03:21.337 --> 03:23.369
<i>But it's good
to talk to her anyway.</i>

03:23.371 --> 03:25.504
<i>So, I tell her
pretty much everything.</i>

03:25.507 --> 03:27.240
I used to run like this.

03:27.242 --> 03:30.244
But now I run like this
which is way faster.

03:30.246 --> 03:34.412
And the winner
is <i>Luchadora</i> Coco!

03:34.414 --> 03:36.549
I have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.

03:36.551 --> 03:38.517
Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.752
Miguel, eat your food.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.388
<i>My</i> abuelita,
<i>she's</i> Mama <i>Coco's daughter.</i>

03:43.390 --> 03:46.524
Oh, you're a twig, <i>mijo.</i>
Have some more.

03:46.527 --> 03:47.660
No, <i>gracias.</i>

03:47.662 --> 03:50.895
I asked if you would
like more tamales!

03:50.898 --> 03:52.265
<i>Si?</i>

03:52.267 --> 03:54.835
That's what
I thought you said!

03:54.837 --> 03:56.401
Abuelita <i>runs our house</i>

03:56.403 --> 03:58.271
<i>just like</i> Mama <i>Imelda did.</i>

04:00.843 --> 04:02.275
No music!

04:03.578 --> 04:04.810
No music!

04:04.812 --> 04:06.679
<i>♪ Y aunque la vida ♪</i>

04:06.681 --> 04:07.981
No music!

04:07.983 --> 04:10.416
<i>I think we're
the only family in Mexico</i>

04:10.418 --> 04:12.386
<i>who hates music.</i>

04:12.388 --> 04:15.388
<i>And my family's fine
with that. But me...</i>

04:15.390 --> 04:17.738
- Be back by lunch, <i>mijo.</i>
- Love you, <i>Mama.</i>

04:18.692 --> 04:21.309
<i>I am not like
the rest of my family!</i>

04:22.564 --> 04:23.963
- <i>Hola,</i> Miguel!
<i>- Hola!</i>

04:29.736 --> 04:32.153
<i>- Muchas gracias.</i>
- <i>De nada,</i> Miguel.

04:36.077 --> 04:38.727
Hey! Dante!

04:39.813 --> 04:43.898
Sit. Down.
Roll over. Shake.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.685
Fist bump!

04:45.687 --> 04:47.901
Good boy, Dante!

04:51.558 --> 04:54.093
<i>I know I'm not
supposed to love music.</i>

04:54.095 --> 04:57.662
<i>But it's not my fault!
It's his!</i>

04:57.664 --> 04:59.564
<i>Ernesto de la Cruz.</i>

04:59.566 --> 05:02.501
<i>The greatest musician
of all time.</i>

05:02.504 --> 05:04.437
Right here
in this very plaza,

05:04.439 --> 05:08.006
Ernesto de la Cruz
took his first steps...

05:08.008 --> 05:12.578
toward becoming the most beloved
singer in Mexican history.

05:12.580 --> 05:17.482
<i>He started out a total
nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me.</i>

05:17.484 --> 05:21.520
<i>But when he played music, he made
people fall in love with him.</i>

05:21.523 --> 05:24.623
<i>He starred in movies.</i>

05:24.625 --> 05:28.927
<i>He had the coolest guitar!
He could fly!</i>

05:28.929 --> 05:31.496
<i>And he wrote the best songs.</i>

05:31.498 --> 05:33.733
<i>But my all-time favorite,
it's...</i>

05:33.735 --> 05:35.768
<i>♪ Remember me</i>

05:35.770 --> 05:37.035
<i>♪ Remember me</i>

05:37.037 --> 05:38.903
<i>♪ Though I have
to say goodbye</i>

05:38.906 --> 05:40.773
<i>- ♪ Remember me
- ♪ Remember me</i>

05:40.775 --> 05:44.677
<i>♪ Don't let it make you cry

05:44.679 --> 05:48.382
<i>♪ I hold you in my heart

06:06.066 --> 06:08.882
<i>He lived the kind

06:12.539 --> 06:14.287
<i>Until 1942.</i>

06:15.977 --> 06:19.227
<i>When he was crushed
by a giant bell.</i>

06:19.981 --> 06:22.697
<i>I want to be just like him.</i>

06:28.655 --> 06:30.855
<i>Sometimes,
I look at de la Cruz</i>

06:30.858 --> 06:35.093
<i>and I get this feeling
like we're connected.</i>

06:35.095 --> 06:40.047
<i>Like if he could play music,
maybe someday, I could too.</i>

06:40.701 --> 06:42.702
If it wasn't for my family.

06:42.704 --> 06:45.104
- <i>Ay-ay-ay, muchacho.</i>
- Huh?

06:45.106 --> 06:47.540
I asked for a shoe shine
not your life story.

06:47.542 --> 06:49.575
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

06:49.577 --> 06:52.845
I just can't really talk about
any of this at home. So...

06:52.847 --> 06:53.845
If I were you,

06:53.847 --> 06:56.015
I'd march right up
to my family and say...

06:56.017 --> 06:58.618
"Hey, I'm a musician.
Deal with it."

06:58.620 --> 07:00.553
I could never say that.

07:00.555 --> 07:02.088
You are a musician, no?

07:02.090 --> 07:03.489
I don't know.

07:03.491 --> 07:06.025
I mean, I only
really play for myself.

07:06.027 --> 07:09.094
Ah! Did de la Cruz become
the world's best musician

07:09.096 --> 07:10.997
by hiding his skills?

07:10.999 --> 07:14.133
No! He walked out
onto that plaza

07:14.135 --> 07:16.134
and he played out loud.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.604
<i>Mira, mira,</i> they're
setting up for tonight!

07:18.606 --> 07:21.007
The music competition
for <i>Dia de Muertos.</i>

07:21.009 --> 07:23.743
You want to be like your hero?
You should sign up!

07:23.745 --> 07:26.646
Uh-uh.
My family would freak!

07:26.648 --> 07:30.332
Look, if you're too scared then,
well, have fun making shoes.

07:31.119 --> 07:34.035
Come on, what did
de la Cruz always say?

07:34.189 --> 07:36.037
Seize your moment?

07:37.157 --> 07:39.157
Show me what
you got, <i>muchacho.</i>

07:40.628 --> 07:42.477
I'll be your first audience.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.218
Miguel!

07:52.907 --> 07:55.041
- <i>Abuelita!</i>
- What are you doing here?

07:56.544 --> 07:57.977
You leave my grandson alone.

07:57.979 --> 07:59.078
<i>Dona,</i> please!

07:59.080 --> 08:00.246
I was just getting
a shine.

08:00.248 --> 08:03.517
I know your tricks, mariachi.
What did he say to you?

08:03.519 --> 08:05.050
He was just
showing me his guitar.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.852
Shame on you.

08:06.855 --> 08:12.158
My grandson is a sweet little
<i>angelito querido cielito.</i>

08:12.160 --> 08:14.894
He wants no part
of your music, mariachi.

08:14.896 --> 08:16.227
You keep away from him.

08:19.933 --> 08:23.669
<i>Ay, pobrecito.</i>
Oh, <i>estas bien, mijo.</i>

08:25.672 --> 08:27.907
You know better than to
be here in this place!

08:27.909 --> 08:31.293
You will come home. Now.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.953
How many times
have we told you?

08:42.956 --> 08:45.323
That plaza is
crawling with mariachis.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.560
Yes, <i>Tio</i> Berto.

08:47.562 --> 08:50.695
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Ah! Go away, you. Go!

08:50.697 --> 08:51.963
It's just Dante.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.099
Never name a street dog.

08:54.101 --> 08:57.151
They'll follow you forever.
Now, go get my shoe.

09:03.278 --> 09:06.012
I found your son
in Mariachi Plaza.

09:06.014 --> 09:07.078
<i>Ay,</i> Miguel!

09:07.080 --> 09:09.714
You know how <i>Abuelita</i>
feels about the plaza.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.017
I was just shining shoes.

09:11.019 --> 09:12.584
A musician's shoes!

09:14.254 --> 09:16.722
But the plaza's where
all the foot traffic is.

09:16.724 --> 09:20.358
If <i>Abuelita</i> says no more
plaza, then no more plaza.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.762
- But what about tonight?
- What's tonight?

09:22.764 --> 09:25.597
Well, they're having
this talent show.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.833
And I
thought I might...

09:27.836 --> 09:30.368
- Sign up?
- Well, maybe?

09:30.370 --> 09:33.738
You have to have
talent to be in a talent show.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.708
What are you gonna do?
Shine shoes?

09:36.710 --> 09:38.176
It's <i>Dia de los Muertos.</i>

09:38.178 --> 09:41.613
No one's going anywhere.
Tonight is about family.

09:41.615 --> 09:44.432
<i>Ofrenda</i> room. <i>Vamonos.</i>

09:55.163 --> 09:57.029
Don't give me that look.

09:57.031 --> 09:59.865
<i>Dia de los Muertos</i>
is the one night of the year

09:59.868 --> 10:01.901
our ancestors
can come visit us.

10:01.903 --> 10:04.136
We've put their photos
on the <i>ofrenda</i>

10:04.138 --> 10:06.038
so their spirits
can cross over.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.006
That is very important.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.909
If we don't put them up,
they can't come.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.645
We made all this food,

10:12.647 --> 10:15.280
set out the things
they loved in life, <i>mijo.</i>

10:15.282 --> 10:18.650
All this work
to bring the family together.

10:18.652 --> 10:21.920
I don't want you sneaking
off to who knows where.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.355
Where are you going?

10:23.357 --> 10:24.890
I thought
we were done.

10:24.893 --> 10:28.026
<i>Ay, Dios mio.</i> Being part
of this family means

10:28.028 --> 10:29.895
being here for this family.

10:29.898 --> 10:32.164
I don't want
to see you end up like...

10:32.167 --> 10:33.332
Like <i>Mama</i> Coco's <i>papa?</i>

10:33.334 --> 10:36.801
Never mention that man!
He's better off forgotten.

10:36.803 --> 10:37.902
But you're the one who...

10:37.905 --> 10:39.070
I was just...

10:39.072 --> 10:40.338
But... I...

10:40.340 --> 10:43.708
<i>Papa? Papa</i> is home?

10:43.710 --> 10:46.679
<i>Mama, calmese, calmese.</i>

10:46.681 --> 10:48.447
<i>Papa</i> is coming home?

10:48.449 --> 10:51.565
No, <i>Mama.</i>
It's okay. I'm here.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.318
Who are you?

10:54.320 --> 10:57.924
Rest, <i>Mama.</i>

10:57.926 --> 11:01.093
I'm hard on you
because I care, Miguel.

11:01.095 --> 11:03.277
Miguel? Miguel?

11:06.234 --> 11:09.367
What are we going
to do with that boy?

11:09.369 --> 11:13.421
You're right.
That's just what he needs.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.097
It's you. Get in here.

11:39.099 --> 11:42.167
Come on, Dante. Hurry up!

11:42.169 --> 11:44.136
You're gonna
get me in trouble, boy.

11:44.138 --> 11:45.720
Someone could hear me.

11:50.445 --> 11:52.410
I wish someone
wanted to hear me.

11:53.748 --> 11:56.730
Other than you. Ew. Okay.

11:58.319 --> 12:00.468
<i>Perfecto!</i>

12:33.888 --> 12:36.454
<i>I have to sing.
I have to play!</i>

12:36.456 --> 12:41.207
<i>The music, it's not
just in me, it is me.</i>

12:42.997 --> 12:46.113
<i>When life gets me down,
I play my guitar.</i>

12:47.034 --> 12:49.234
<i>The rest of the world
may follow the rules,</i>

12:49.236 --> 12:52.119
<i>but I must follow my heart.</i>

12:52.506 --> 12:54.173
Ugh!

12:54.175 --> 12:56.974
<i>You know that feeling like
there's a song in the air and...</i>

12:56.976 --> 12:59.093
<i>it's playing just for you?</i>

13:02.216 --> 13:05.384
<i>♪ A feeling so close...</i>

13:05.386 --> 13:09.703

<i>Oh, but,</i> Padre,
<i>he will never listen.</i>

13:21.368 --> 13:23.401
<i>He will listen. To music.</i>

13:23.403 --> 13:27.005
<i>♪ Only a song,

13:27.007 --> 13:29.690
<i>♪ Has the power

13:33.947 --> 13:36.831
<i>Never underestimate

13:41.221 --> 13:44.556
<i>But my father, he will
never give his permission.</i>

13:44.558 --> 13:46.191
<i>I am done
asking permission.</i>

13:46.193 --> 13:49.362
<i>When you see your moment, you
mustn't let it pass you by.</i>

13:49.364 --> 13:51.262
<i>You must seize it!</i>

13:51.265 --> 13:52.497
Senor <i>de la Cruz,</i>

13:52.499 --> 13:55.548
<i>what did it take for you
to seize your moment?</i>

13:57.105 --> 14:00.006
<i>I had to have
faith in my dream.</i>

14:00.008 --> 14:01.973
<i>No one was going
to hand it to me.</i>

14:01.975 --> 14:04.276
<i>It was up to me
to reach for that dream.</i>

14:04.278 --> 14:06.245
<i>Grab it tight
and make it come true.</i>

14:06.247 --> 14:07.862
<i>...and make it come true.</i>

14:12.387 --> 14:16.021
No more hiding, Dante.
I got to seize my moment!

14:17.192 --> 14:20.192
I'm gonna play in Mariachi
Plaza if it kills me.

14:23.565 --> 14:27.266
<i>Dia de los Muertos</i> has begun!

14:27.268 --> 14:30.535
No, no. We have to make
a clear path.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.170
The petals guide
our ancestors home.

14:33.172 --> 14:35.207
We don't want
their spirits to get lost.

14:35.210 --> 14:37.910
We want them to come
and enjoy all the food

14:37.912 --> 14:39.527
and drinks on the <i>ofrenda.</i>

14:40.614 --> 14:41.979
<i>Mama!</i>

14:41.981 --> 14:43.347
Where should we
put this table?

14:43.349 --> 14:45.050
In the courtyard, <i>mijos.</i>

14:45.052 --> 14:46.218
You want it
down by the kitchen?

14:46.221 --> 14:48.620
<i>Si.</i> Next to the other one.

14:51.191 --> 14:54.160
- Get under! Get under!
- Miguel?

14:54.162 --> 14:57.597
Nothing! <i>Mama, Papa.</i> I...

14:57.599 --> 15:02.467
Miguel, your <i>abuelita</i> had
the most wonderful idea.

15:02.469 --> 15:06.705
We've all decided. It's time
you joined us in the workshop!

15:06.707 --> 15:09.175
- What?
- No more shining shoes.

15:09.177 --> 15:12.110
You'll be making them
every day after school.

15:12.112 --> 15:15.180
Oh! Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to

15:15.182 --> 15:17.649
carrying on
the family tradition.

15:17.651 --> 15:20.318
And on <i>Dia de los Muertos!</i>

15:20.320 --> 15:23.121
Your ancestors
will be so proud.

15:23.123 --> 15:26.525
You'll craft huaraches
just like your <i>Tia</i> Victoria.

15:26.528 --> 15:29.194
And wingtips
like your <i>Papa</i> Julio.

15:29.196 --> 15:31.730
But what if
I'm no good at making shoes?

15:31.732 --> 15:36.102
Ah, Miguel. You have your
family here to guide you.

15:36.104 --> 15:40.689
You are a Rivera.
And a Rivera is...

15:41.375 --> 15:44.242
A shoemaker.
Through and through.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.280
That's my boy!
Berto!

15:47.282 --> 15:50.247
Break out the good stuff.
I want to make a toast.

16:00.160 --> 16:03.877
Dante! No, Dante. Stop!

16:14.142 --> 16:17.459
No, no, no, no, no! No.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.589
De la Cruz's guitar?

16:31.592 --> 16:35.041
<i>Papa? Papa?</i>

16:36.195 --> 16:40.166
<i>Mama</i> Coco, is your <i>papa</i>
Ernesto de la Cruz?

16:40.168 --> 16:42.801
<i>Papa! Papa!</i>

16:54.415 --> 16:56.549
<i>Papa! Papa!</i> It's him!

16:56.551 --> 16:58.416
I know who my
great-great-grandfather was.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.453
Miguel, get down
from there.

17:00.455 --> 17:03.221
<i>Mama</i> Coco's father
was Ernesto de la Cruz!

17:03.223 --> 17:04.521
What are you talking about?

17:04.525 --> 17:06.606
I'm gonna be a musician!

17:08.327 --> 17:09.628
What is all this?

17:09.631 --> 17:11.730
You keep secrets
from your own family?

17:11.732 --> 17:14.065
It's all that time
he spends in the plaza.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.468
Fills his head
with crazy fantasies.

17:15.470 --> 17:17.069
It's not a fantasy.

17:17.070 --> 17:19.336
That man was
Ernesto de la Cruz!

17:19.338 --> 17:21.207
The greatest musician
of all time!

17:21.209 --> 17:22.741
We've never known anything
about this man!

17:22.742 --> 17:26.478
But whoever he was, he still
abandoned his family.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.113
This is no future
for my son.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.650
But, <i>Papa,</i> you said
my family would guide me.

17:30.652 --> 17:33.219
Well, de la Cruz
is my family.

17:33.221 --> 17:34.754
I'm supposed to play music.

17:34.756 --> 17:37.089
Never! That man's music
was a curse.

17:37.091 --> 17:39.091
I will not allow it.

17:39.093 --> 17:40.624
- If you would just let...
- Miguel...

17:40.626 --> 17:42.228
You will listen
to your family.

17:42.230 --> 17:43.527
No more music.

17:43.529 --> 17:46.679
- Just listen to me play!
- End of argument.

17:48.502 --> 17:51.169
You want to end up
like that man? Forgotten?

17:51.171 --> 17:53.573
Left off
your family's <i>ofrenda?</i>

17:53.575 --> 17:55.707
I don't care if I'm on
some stupid <i>ofrenda.</i>

17:59.546 --> 18:00.711
- No!
- <i>Mama!</i>

18:05.420 --> 18:09.254
There. No guitar.
No music.

18:11.526 --> 18:16.460
Oh, come. You'll feel better
after you eat with your family.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.579
I don't want
to be in this family!

18:18.799 --> 18:21.047
Miguel! Miguel!

18:39.486 --> 18:42.354
I want to play in the plaza,
like de la Cruz.

18:42.356 --> 18:43.555
Can I still sign up?

18:43.557 --> 18:45.223
You got an instrument?

18:45.225 --> 18:47.559
No. But if I
can borrow a guitar...

18:47.561 --> 18:49.427
Musicians got to bring
their own instruments.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.896
You find a guitar, kid,

18:50.899 --> 18:52.613
I'll put you on the list.

18:54.836 --> 18:58.303
- Can I borrow your guitar?
- Sorry, <i>muchacho.</i>

18:58.305 --> 19:01.305
- You guys have a spare guitar?
- No.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.440
I need a guitar
just for a little bit.

19:03.442 --> 19:06.025
Get out of here, kid.

19:17.858 --> 19:22.208
Great-great-grandfather,
what am I supposed to do?

19:59.901 --> 20:01.399
No, no, no, no.

20:01.401 --> 20:04.269
Dante, stop! <i>Callate!</i> Shh!

20:25.727 --> 20:27.241
I'm sorry.

21:03.498 --> 21:07.332
<i>Senor</i> de la Cruz,
please don't be mad.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.699
I'm Miguel.

21:08.701 --> 21:13.286
Your great-great grandson.
I need to borrow this.

21:16.310 --> 21:18.843
Our family thinks
music is a curse.

21:18.845 --> 21:22.746
None of them understand
but I know you would have.

21:22.748 --> 21:25.517
You would have told me
to follow my heart.

21:25.519 --> 21:27.033
To seize my moment!

21:28.323 --> 21:31.324
So, if it's
all right with you,

21:31.326 --> 21:34.041
I'm gonna play in the plaza.
Just like you did!

21:41.768 --> 21:44.736
The guitar! It's gone!

21:44.738 --> 21:47.037
Somebody stole
de la Cruz's guitar!

21:47.039 --> 21:49.342
The window's broken.
Look!

21:53.747 --> 21:55.513
All right, who's in there?

21:55.515 --> 21:57.350
I'm sorry.
It's not what it looks like.

21:57.352 --> 21:58.866
De la Cruz is my...

21:59.952 --> 22:02.235
There's nobody here.

22:17.671 --> 22:19.036
- Miguel!
<i>- Mama!</i>

22:19.038 --> 22:23.675
Miguel, come home.
Where are you, Miguel?

22:26.913 --> 22:30.515
<i>Dios mio!</i>
Little boy. Are you okay?

22:30.517 --> 22:32.232
Here. Let me help you.

22:33.121 --> 22:34.901
Thanks. I...

22:45.097 --> 22:47.413
Do you mind? Whoa!

23:07.954 --> 23:10.689
Look how big she's getting.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.727
Dante!

23:15.729 --> 23:18.729
You can see me? Wait!

23:18.731 --> 23:21.782
What's going on? Dante!

23:23.671 --> 23:25.969
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Miguel?

23:25.972 --> 23:27.755
- Miguel?
- Miguel?

23:31.143 --> 23:34.845
You're here? Here, here.
And you can see us?

23:34.847 --> 23:37.481
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to!

23:37.483 --> 23:38.984
Remind me how I know you.

23:38.986 --> 23:41.968
We're your family, <i>mijo.</i>

23:42.923 --> 23:45.773
<i>- Tia</i> Rosita?
<i>- Si.</i>

23:47.661 --> 23:49.943
<i>- Papa</i> Julio?
<i>- Hola.</i>

23:50.697 --> 23:52.130
<i>Tia</i> Victoria?

23:52.132 --> 23:54.631
He doesn't
seem entirely dead.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.535
He's not quite alive either.

23:57.538 --> 24:00.138
We need <i>Mama</i> Imelda.
She'll know how to fix this.

24:00.140 --> 24:04.141
<i>Oye!</i> It's <i>Mama</i> Imelda.

24:04.143 --> 24:05.543
She couldn't cross over.

24:05.546 --> 24:07.978
- She's stuck!
- On the other side!

24:07.980 --> 24:10.782
<i>Tio</i> Oscar? <i>Tio</i> Felipe?

24:10.784 --> 24:12.883
Oh. Hey, Miguel.

24:12.885 --> 24:15.519
I have a feeling this has
something to do with you.

24:15.521 --> 24:17.655
But if <i>Mama</i> Imelda
can't come to us...

24:17.657 --> 24:19.923
Then we are going to her.
<i>Vamonos!</i>

24:33.839 --> 24:35.206
Whoa.

24:35.209 --> 24:37.957
Come on, Miguel.
It's okay.

24:50.656 --> 24:55.141
Dante? Dante!
Dante, wait up!

24:57.564 --> 25:02.415
You got to stay with me, boy.
We don't know... where...

25:22.823 --> 25:26.256
This isn't a dream then.
You're all really out there.

25:26.259 --> 25:28.226
- You thought we weren't?
- Well, I don't know.

25:28.228 --> 25:30.094
I thought it might've been
one of those

25:30.096 --> 25:32.029
made up things
that adults tell kids.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.598
Like vitamins.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.734
Miguel,
vitamins are a real thing.

25:35.736 --> 25:37.901
Well, now I'm thinking
maybe they could be.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.970
<i>Mija,</i> it's not nice to stare at...

25:39.972 --> 25:41.640
<i>Ay!</i> Santa Maria!

25:49.316 --> 25:53.718
Are those...
Alebrijes! But those are...

25:53.720 --> 25:56.254
Real alebrijes.
Spirit creatures.

25:56.256 --> 25:58.122
They guide souls
on their journey.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.592
Watch your step. They
make <i>caquitas</i> everywhere.

26:00.594 --> 26:02.794
<i>Welcome back
to the Land of the Dead.</i>

26:02.796 --> 26:05.630
<i>Please have all offerings
ready for re-entry.</i>

26:05.632 --> 26:07.865
Welcome back.
Anything to declare?

26:07.867 --> 26:09.333
Some churros.
From my family.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.335
How wonderful. Next.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.204
<i>If you are
experiencing travel issues,</i>

26:13.207 --> 26:14.940
<i>agents at
the Department of Family...</i>

26:14.942 --> 26:17.175
<i>Reunions are
available to assist you.</i>

26:17.177 --> 26:18.959
Next family, please.

26:22.449 --> 26:25.016
Oh! Your photos
are on your son's <i>ofrenda.</i>

26:25.018 --> 26:26.383
Have a great visit.

26:26.385 --> 26:27.651
<i>Gracias.</i>

26:27.653 --> 26:29.688
<i>And remember
to return before sunrise.</i>

26:29.690 --> 26:30.889
<i>Enjoy your visit.</i>

26:30.891 --> 26:33.224
Next.

26:33.227 --> 26:36.760
Your photo's on your dentist's <i>ofrenda.</i>
Enjoy your visit.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.544
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- Next?

26:40.834 --> 26:43.067
Yes! It is I.
Frida Kahlo.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.635
Shall we skip
the scanner?

26:44.637 --> 26:48.354
I'm on so many <i>ofrendas</i> it'll just
overwhelm your blinky thingy.

26:50.076 --> 26:54.646
Well, shoot, looks like no one
put up your photo, Frida.

26:54.648 --> 26:58.917
Okay, when I said I was Frida,
just now, that was a lie.

26:58.919 --> 27:00.317
And I apologize
for doing that.

27:00.319 --> 27:03.188
No photo on an <i>ofrenda,</i>
no crossing the bridge.

27:03.190 --> 27:06.973
I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.

27:07.928 --> 27:10.109
Hey!

27:15.669 --> 27:19.403
Almost... there.
Just a little further.

27:24.211 --> 27:25.275
Upsy-daisy...

27:25.278 --> 27:29.680
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?
Dumb flower bridge!

27:29.682 --> 27:33.785
Aw. I don't know what I'd do
if no one put up my photo.

27:33.787 --> 27:36.086
- Next?
- Oh! Come, <i>mijo.</i> It's our turn.

27:36.088 --> 27:39.024
Welcome back, <i>amigos.</i>
Anything to declare?

27:39.026 --> 27:42.443
As a matter of fact, yes.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.143
<i>Hola.</i>

27:50.970 --> 27:53.138
<i>Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos.</i>

27:53.140 --> 27:56.022
<i>Please report to Level Seven.</i>

28:00.314 --> 28:02.061
Whoa!

28:05.251 --> 28:07.300
I miss my nose.

28:16.329 --> 28:18.295
Come on, help us out, <i>amigo.</i>

28:18.297 --> 28:19.764
We got to get to
a dozen <i>ofrendas</i> tonight.

28:19.766 --> 28:23.901
We are not visiting your ex-wife's
family for <i>Dia de Muertos!</i>

28:23.903 --> 28:26.438
I demand to speak
to the person in charge!

28:26.440 --> 28:29.341
I'm sorry, <i>senora,</i> it says
here no one put up your photo.

28:29.343 --> 28:33.911
My family always puts my
photo on the <i>ofrenda.</i>

28:33.913 --> 28:37.014
That devil box tells
you nothing but lies!

28:37.016 --> 28:41.785
- <i>Mama</i> Imelda?
- Oh, <i>mi familia!</i>

28:41.787 --> 28:43.387
They wouldn't let me
cross the bridge.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.890
Tell this woman
and her devil box

28:45.893 --> 28:48.426
that my photo
is on the <i>ofrenda.</i>

28:48.428 --> 28:51.896
Well, we never
made it to the <i>ofrenda.</i>

28:51.899 --> 28:55.615
- What?
- We ran into...

28:58.304 --> 29:01.422
- Miguel?
<i>- Mama</i> Imelda.

29:01.842 --> 29:04.175
What is going on?

29:04.177 --> 29:06.478
You the Rivera family?

29:08.081 --> 29:09.447
Well, you're cursed.

29:09.449 --> 29:10.582
What?

29:10.584 --> 29:13.218
<i>Dia de los Muertos</i> is the
night to give to the dead.

29:13.220 --> 29:14.819
You stole from the dead!

29:14.821 --> 29:16.187
But I wasn't
stealing the guitar.

29:16.190 --> 29:17.321
Guitar?

29:17.323 --> 29:18.922
It was my
great-great-grandfather's.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.225
He would have
wanted me to have it.

29:20.227 --> 29:23.361
Ah, ah, ah. We do not speak
of that musician.

29:23.363 --> 29:25.095
He is dead to this family.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.064
Uh,
you're all dead.

29:28.134 --> 29:30.802
I am sorry.
Whose alebrije is that?

29:30.804 --> 29:32.069
That's just Dante.

29:32.071 --> 29:34.205
He sure doesn't
look like an alebrije.

29:34.208 --> 29:35.806
He just looks
like a plain old dog.

29:35.808 --> 29:38.074
Or a sausage someone dropped
in a barbershop.

29:38.076 --> 29:41.845
Whatever he is, I am
terribly allergic.

29:41.847 --> 29:43.515
But Dante
doesn't have any hair.

29:43.517 --> 29:46.217
And I don't have a nose,
and yet, here we are.

29:47.421 --> 29:51.121
But none of this explains
why I couldn't cross over.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.805
Oh!

29:54.260 --> 29:56.994
You took my photo
off the <i>ofrenda?</i>

29:56.996 --> 29:59.095
- It was an accident!
- How do we send him back?

29:59.097 --> 30:01.833
Well,
since it's a family matter...

30:01.835 --> 30:04.268
the way to undo
a family curse

30:04.270 --> 30:07.004
- is to get your family's blessing.
- That's it?

30:07.006 --> 30:08.406
Get your family's blessing

30:08.408 --> 30:11.007
and everything should
go back to normal.

30:11.009 --> 30:13.044
But you got
to do it by sunrise.

30:13.046 --> 30:14.978
What happens at sunrise?

30:14.981 --> 30:16.830
<i>Hijole!</i> Your hand!

30:21.989 --> 30:24.855
Whoa, Miguel, can't have
you fainting on us.

30:24.857 --> 30:27.425
But not to worry.
Your family's here.

30:27.427 --> 30:29.460
You can get
your blessing right now.

30:29.462 --> 30:34.431
<i>Cempasuchil, cempasuchil.</i>
Aha! <i>Perdon, senora.</i>

30:34.433 --> 30:35.400
Oh.

30:35.402 --> 30:38.319
Now, you look at the living
and say his name.

30:39.205 --> 30:40.237
Miguel.

30:40.239 --> 30:43.541
Nailed it. Now say,
"I give you my blessing."

30:43.544 --> 30:45.592
I give you my blessing.

30:48.015 --> 30:51.414
I give you my blessing
to go home...

30:51.416 --> 30:54.585
to put my photo
back on the <i>ofrenda,</i>

30:54.587 --> 30:57.022
and to never
play music again.

30:57.024 --> 30:58.890
What? She can't do that!

30:58.892 --> 31:02.159
Well, technically, she can
add any condition she wants.

31:02.161 --> 31:04.294
Fine.

31:04.297 --> 31:06.513
Then you hand
the petal to Miguel.

31:19.046 --> 31:20.393
No skeletons!

31:24.483 --> 31:26.765
Mariachi Plaza,
here I come.

31:30.990 --> 31:33.189
Two seconds and you already
break your promise.

31:33.191 --> 31:37.062
This isn't fair. It's my life.
You already had yours.

31:37.064 --> 31:39.130
<i>Papa</i> Julio,
I ask for your blessing.

31:39.132 --> 31:42.233
<i>Tia</i> Rosita? Oscar?

31:42.236 --> 31:45.102
Felipe? <i>Tia</i> Victoria?

31:45.104 --> 31:49.506
Don't make this hard, <i>mijo.</i>
You go home my way or no way.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.374
You really hate
music that much?

31:51.376 --> 31:54.526
I will not let you go down
the same path he did.

31:56.950 --> 32:01.151
The same path he did.
He's family.

32:01.153 --> 32:02.954
Listen to your <i>Mama</i> Imelda.

32:02.956 --> 32:04.220
She's just
looking out for you.

32:04.222 --> 32:05.289
Be reasonable.

32:05.291 --> 32:08.625
<i>Con permiso,</i>
I need to visit the restroom.

32:08.628 --> 32:10.410
Be right back.

32:11.265 --> 32:13.364
Uh, should we tell him
there are no restrooms

32:13.366 --> 32:14.680
in the Land of the Dead?

32:27.713 --> 32:28.880
<i>Vamonos.</i>

32:28.882 --> 32:31.583
We got a family
looking for a living boy.

32:31.585 --> 32:34.318
If I want to be a musician,
I need a musician's blessing.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.388
We got to find
my great-great-grandpa.

32:36.390 --> 32:38.439
Hold it, <i>muchacho.</i>

32:42.028 --> 32:43.394
I found that living boy!

32:43.396 --> 32:45.629
Oh, whoa, excuse me.
Excuse me, folks.

32:45.631 --> 32:46.981
Excuse me.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.248
Oh.

32:53.006 --> 32:55.272
No, no. Dante!

32:55.274 --> 32:58.308
Disturbing the peace.
Fleeing an officer.

32:58.311 --> 33:00.177
Falsifying a unibrow.

33:00.179 --> 33:02.446
- That's illegal?
- Very illegal.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.547
You need to clean up
your act, <i>amigo.</i>

33:04.549 --> 33:08.285
<i>Amigo?</i> Oh, that's so nice
to hear you say that

33:08.287 --> 33:10.086
because I have just had a...

33:10.088 --> 33:13.024
really hard <i>Dia de Muertos</i>
and I could really use

33:13.026 --> 33:14.025
an <i>amigo</i> right now.

33:14.027 --> 33:16.760
And <i>amigos,</i>
they help their <i>amigos.</i>

33:16.762 --> 33:19.462
You get me across
that bridge tonight,

33:19.464 --> 33:21.065
and I'll make it
worth your while.

33:21.067 --> 33:24.169
Oh! You like de la Cruz?
He and I go way back.

33:24.171 --> 33:27.505
I can get you front row seats to
his Sunrise Spectacular show.

33:27.507 --> 33:29.708
I'll get you backstage.
You can meet him.

33:29.710 --> 33:31.442
You just got to let me
cross that bridge!

33:31.444 --> 33:33.612
I should lock you up
for the rest of the holiday.

33:33.614 --> 33:37.716
But my shift's almost up and I
want to visit my living family.

33:37.718 --> 33:40.433
So I'm letting you off
with a warning.

33:41.386 --> 33:43.521
Can I at least
get my costume back?

33:43.524 --> 33:45.322
Uh... No.

33:45.324 --> 33:47.807
Some <i>amigo.</i>

33:50.263 --> 33:53.731
Hey! Hey!
You really know de la Cruz?

33:53.733 --> 33:56.367
Who wants to... Ahh!
<i>Ay!</i> You're alive!

33:56.369 --> 33:58.069
Shh! Yeah, I'm alive.

33:58.071 --> 34:00.137
And if I want to get back
to the Land of the Living...

34:00.139 --> 34:01.604
I need de la Cruz's blessing.

34:01.606 --> 34:03.208
That's weirdly specific.

34:03.210 --> 34:04.742
He's my
great-great-grandfather.

34:04.744 --> 34:07.326
He's your Gr... What?

34:07.748 --> 34:09.679
Ugh.

34:09.681 --> 34:13.534
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

34:14.387 --> 34:16.487
Wait. No, wait, wait, wait.

34:16.489 --> 34:20.623
Wait! Yes! You're going back
to the Land of the Living!

34:20.625 --> 34:22.625
You know what? Maybe this
isn't such a good...

34:22.627 --> 34:25.360
No, no, <i>nino! Nino, nino,</i> I can help you.
You can help me.

34:25.362 --> 34:26.496
We can help each other.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.364
But most importantly,
you can help me.

34:28.366 --> 34:29.867
- Miguel!
- I'm Hector.

34:29.869 --> 34:31.417
That's nice.

34:36.109 --> 34:37.757
<i>Esperame, chamaco!</i>

34:45.585 --> 34:48.152
<i>Ay,</i> he is going
to get himself killed.

34:48.155 --> 34:51.771
I need my spirit guide...
Pepita.

35:03.468 --> 35:05.537
Who has that petal
Miguel touched?

35:05.539 --> 35:08.654
Here. Nice alebrije.

35:21.687 --> 35:26.004
<i>Ay, ay,</i> hold still. Look up. <i>A ver, a ver.</i>
Look up, up, up.

35:27.293 --> 35:32.428
<i>Aqui arriba, eso...</i>
Eh, <i>la rayita.</i>

35:32.430 --> 35:35.013
Okay. Hey! Ta-da!

35:35.701 --> 35:37.550
Dead as a doorknob.

35:38.504 --> 35:41.605
So listen, Miguel,
this place runs on memories.

35:41.607 --> 35:42.840
When you're well remembered,

35:42.842 --> 35:44.707
people put up your photo
and you get to...

35:44.709 --> 35:46.310
cross the bridge
and visit the living

35:46.312 --> 35:48.779
on <i>Dia de Muertos.</i>
Unless you're me.

35:48.781 --> 35:50.581
You don't get
to cross over?

35:50.583 --> 35:51.849
No one's ever
put up my picture.

35:51.851 --> 35:53.632
But you can change that!

35:53.853 --> 35:55.618
This is you?

35:55.620 --> 35:57.254
Eh, <i>muy guapo,</i> eh?

35:57.256 --> 36:00.357
So, you get me
to my great-great-grandpa...

36:00.359 --> 36:03.259
then I put up your photo
when I get home?

36:03.261 --> 36:06.931
Such a smart boy! Yes!
Great idea, yes! One hiccup.

36:06.934 --> 36:08.867
De la Cruz is
a tough guy to get to

36:08.869 --> 36:10.668
and I need to
cross the bridge soon.

36:10.670 --> 36:11.670
Like, tonight.

36:11.672 --> 36:13.636
So, you got any other
family here, you know?

36:13.638 --> 36:15.773
Someone a bit more,
eh, accessible?

36:15.775 --> 36:17.608
Mmm... Nope.

36:17.610 --> 36:18.942
Don't yank my chain,
<i>chamaco.</i>

36:18.945 --> 36:20.544
You got to have
some other family.

36:20.546 --> 36:21.880
Only de la Cruz.

36:21.882 --> 36:23.913
If you can't help me,
I'll find him myself.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.786
Oh! Okay. Okay, kid.
Fine! Fine!

36:27.788 --> 36:29.668
I'll get you to your
great-great-grandpa.

36:31.357 --> 36:32.823
It's not gonna
be easy, you know?

36:32.825 --> 36:35.961
He's a busy man.
What are you doing?

36:35.963 --> 36:38.629
I'm walking like a skeleton.
Blending in.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.432
No. Skeletons
don't walk like that.

36:40.434 --> 36:44.500
- It's how you walk.
- No, I don't! Stop it!

36:44.502 --> 36:48.440
Whoa! Ernesto de la Cruz's
Sunrise Spectacular?

36:48.442 --> 36:50.241
<i>Que padre!</i>

36:50.244 --> 36:53.377
Every year your great-great-grandpa
puts on that dumb show...

36:53.379 --> 36:54.813
to mark the end
of <i>Dia de Muertos.</i>

36:54.815 --> 36:57.381
- And you can get us in!
- Um...

36:57.383 --> 36:59.650
Hey, you said you have
front row tickets!

36:59.652 --> 37:02.853
That... was a lie.
I apologize for that.

37:02.855 --> 37:05.022
Cool off, <i>chamaco.</i>
Come on. I'll get you to him.

37:05.024 --> 37:06.123
How?

37:06.125 --> 37:08.241
Because I happen to know
where he's rehearsing.

37:18.803 --> 37:22.988
<i>♪ Remember me
Don't let it make you cry ♪</i>

37:24.277 --> 37:26.542
You better have
my dress, Hector.

37:26.544 --> 37:27.926
<i>Hola,</i> Ceci.

37:33.753 --> 37:38.023
- <i>Hola.</i>
- Ceci, I lost the dress.

37:38.025 --> 37:39.690
<i>Ya lo sabia!</i>

37:39.692 --> 37:41.959
I got to dress
forty dancers by sunrise.

37:41.961 --> 37:45.828
Thanks to you, I'm one Frida
short of an opening number!

37:45.830 --> 37:49.916
Dante!
We shouldn't be in here.

38:04.850 --> 38:07.166
No, no, Dante! <i>Ven aca!</i>

38:15.995 --> 38:17.861
You! How did you
get in here?

38:17.863 --> 38:22.031
- I just followed my...
- Oh! The mighty Xolo dog!

38:22.033 --> 38:25.002
Guider of wandering spirits.

38:25.004 --> 38:28.038
And whose spirit
have you guided to me?

38:28.040 --> 38:30.406
I don't think
he's a spirit guide.

38:30.408 --> 38:31.408
Ah, ah, ah.

38:31.410 --> 38:34.478
The alebrijes of this world
can take many forms.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.797
They are as mysterious
as they are powerful.

38:43.388 --> 38:47.239
Or maybe he's just a dog.
Come, I need your eyes.

38:48.493 --> 38:52.663
You are the audience.
Darkness.

38:52.665 --> 38:56.883
And from the darkness,
a giant papaya.

38:57.838 --> 39:00.838
Dancers emerge
from the papaya,

39:00.840 --> 39:04.908
and the dancers are all me.

39:04.911 --> 39:07.643
And they go to drink from
the milk of their mother,

39:07.646 --> 39:08.847
who is a cactus.

39:08.849 --> 39:10.581
But who is also me.

39:10.583 --> 39:14.900
And her milk is
not milk but tears.

39:15.856 --> 39:16.920
Is it too obvious?

39:16.923 --> 39:20.656
I think it's just
the right amount of obvious?

39:20.659 --> 39:24.060
It could use some music.
Oh, what if you did like...

39:27.466 --> 39:28.931
Oh! And then it could go...

39:34.540 --> 39:37.409
And what if
everything was on fire?

39:37.411 --> 39:39.610
Yes! Fire! Everywhere!

39:39.612 --> 39:43.814
Inspired! You have
the spirit of an artist.

39:45.750 --> 39:48.686
The dancers exit. The music
fades, the lights go out.

39:48.688 --> 39:52.022
And Ernesto de la Cruz
rises to the stage!

39:55.828 --> 39:57.127
Huh?

39:57.129 --> 39:59.462
He does a couple of songs, the
sun rises, everyone cheers...

39:59.464 --> 40:01.998
Excuse me,
where's the real de la Cruz?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.100
Ernesto doesn't do
rehearsals!

40:04.102 --> 40:08.019
He's too busy hosting that fancy
party at the top of his tower.

40:11.344 --> 40:13.644
<i>Chamaco,</i> you can't run off
on me like that.

40:13.646 --> 40:15.478
Stop pestering
the celebrities.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.648
You said my great-great-grandpa
would be here!

40:17.650 --> 40:20.516
He's halfway across town
throwing some big party.

40:20.518 --> 40:22.921
That bum. Who doesn't show up
to his own rehearsal?

40:22.923 --> 40:25.855
If you're such good friends,
how come he didn't invite you?

40:25.857 --> 40:28.726
He's your great-great-grandpa,
how come he didn't invite you?

40:28.728 --> 40:31.729
Hey, Gustavo! You know
anything about this party?

40:31.731 --> 40:33.163
It's the hot ticket!

40:33.165 --> 40:34.765
But if you're not
on the guest list,

40:34.767 --> 40:37.202
you're never
getting in, <i>Chorizo.</i>

40:37.204 --> 40:40.002
Hey! It's <i>Chorizo! Choricito!</i>

40:40.005 --> 40:41.638
A-ha. Very funny, guys.
Very funny.

40:41.641 --> 40:42.873
<i>Chorizo?</i>

40:42.875 --> 40:45.007
Oh, this guy's famous!

40:45.010 --> 40:47.143
Go on, go on.
Ask him how he died.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.779
I don't want
to talk about it.

40:48.781 --> 40:51.915
He choked on some <i>chorizo!</i>

40:54.019 --> 40:55.753
I didn't choke, okay?

40:55.755 --> 40:57.755
I got food poisoning
which is a big difference.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.524
This is why
I don't like musicians.

41:00.526 --> 41:02.158
Bunch of
self-important jerks.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.662
- Hey! I'm a musician!
- You are?

41:04.664 --> 41:07.499
If you really want
to get to Ernesto,

41:07.501 --> 41:08.899
there is that
music competition...

41:08.901 --> 41:10.567
at the Plaza de la Cruz.

41:10.570 --> 41:13.119
Winner gets
to play at his party.

41:14.073 --> 41:17.074
No, no. <i>Chamaco,</i>
you're <i>loco</i> if you think...

41:17.076 --> 41:19.510
I need to get my
great-great-grandfather's blessing!

41:19.512 --> 41:21.393
You know where
I can get a guitar?

41:21.981 --> 41:25.263
I know a guy.

41:36.795 --> 41:39.929
Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?

41:41.133 --> 41:43.933
- A footprint!
- It's a Rivera boot.

41:43.935 --> 41:45.802
- Size seven!
- And a half.

41:45.804 --> 41:48.254
- Pronated.
- Miguel.

41:57.750 --> 41:59.683
Why the heck would
you want to be a musician?

41:59.685 --> 42:01.552
My great-great-grandpa
was a musician!

42:01.554 --> 42:03.086
Who spent his life
performing like a monkey

42:03.088 --> 42:04.888
for complete strangers.

42:04.890 --> 42:07.291
No thank you.
No! <i>Guacala!</i>

42:07.293 --> 42:09.158
What do you know?

42:09.160 --> 42:11.563
So, how far is
this guitar anyway?

42:11.565 --> 42:12.945
We're almost there.

42:17.770 --> 42:19.351
Keep up, <i>chamaco.</i> Come on.

42:28.014 --> 42:32.716
- Cousin Hector!
- Hey! These guys! Hey, <i>Tio!</i>

42:32.718 --> 42:33.851
<i>¿Que onda?</i>

42:33.853 --> 42:35.319
These people are
all your family?

42:35.321 --> 42:36.687
Uh...

42:36.689 --> 42:40.023
In a way. We're all the ones
with no photos or <i>ofrendas.</i>

42:40.025 --> 42:43.160
No family to go home to.
Nearly forgotten, you know?

42:43.162 --> 42:47.313
So, we all call each other
cousin, or <i>tio,</i> or whatever.

42:51.736 --> 42:54.252
- Hector!
- <i>Tia</i> Chelo!

42:56.041 --> 42:58.141
<i>Muchas gracias!</i>

42:58.143 --> 43:00.676
Hey! Save some for me!
Is Chicharron around?

43:00.679 --> 43:01.844
Eh, in the bungalow.

43:01.846 --> 43:04.348
I don't know if he's in
the mood for visitors.

43:04.350 --> 43:07.632
Who doesn't like
a visit from Cousin Hector?

43:16.795 --> 43:18.661
<i>Buenas noches,</i> Chicharron!

43:18.663 --> 43:21.098
I don't want to see
your stupid face, Hector.

43:21.100 --> 43:23.166
Come on.
It's <i>Dia de Muertos.</i>

43:23.168 --> 43:24.768
I brought you
a little offering.

43:24.770 --> 43:26.837
- Get out of here.
- I would, Cheech.

43:26.839 --> 43:29.488
But the thing is,
me and my friend, Miguel...

43:30.643 --> 43:32.341
We really need
to borrow your guitar.

43:32.344 --> 43:33.911
- My guitar?
- Yes.

43:33.913 --> 43:36.212
My prized beloved guitar?

43:36.214 --> 43:38.047
I promise
we'll bring it right back.

43:38.049 --> 43:40.717
Like the time you promised
to bring back my van?

43:40.719 --> 43:42.186
- Uh...
- Or my mini-fridge?

43:42.188 --> 43:43.921
- Ah, you see...
- Or my good napkins?

43:43.923 --> 43:45.756
My lasso? My femur?

43:45.758 --> 43:46.989
Well, no,
not like those times.

43:46.992 --> 43:49.326
Where is my femur?
You...

43:49.328 --> 43:51.328
Whoa, whoa.

43:51.330 --> 43:55.247
- You okay, <i>amigo?</i>
- I'm fading, Hector.

43:55.835 --> 43:58.268
I can feel it.

43:58.271 --> 44:01.453
I couldn't even play
that thing if I wanted to.

44:04.676 --> 44:07.211
You play me something.

44:07.213 --> 44:09.279
No. You know
I don't play anymore, Cheech.

44:09.282 --> 44:11.215
The guitar is for the kid.

44:11.217 --> 44:15.000
You want it,
you got to earn it.

44:16.389 --> 44:19.271
<i>Ay,</i> only for you, <i>amigo.</i>

44:21.826 --> 44:23.226
Any requests?

44:23.228 --> 44:27.312
You know my favorite, Hector.

44:44.784 --> 44:48.500
<i>♪ Well,
everyone knows Juanita</i>

44:49.455 --> 44:53.072
<i>♪ Her eyes

44:54.759 --> 44:59.444
<i>♪ Her teeth stick out

45:00.399 --> 45:03.047
<i>♪ And her...</i>

45:04.002 --> 45:07.136
<i>♪ Knuckles they
drag on the floor</i>

45:07.138 --> 45:09.772
- Those aren't the words.
- There are children present.

45:09.774 --> 45:13.524
<i>♪ Her hair is like a briar</i>

45:14.480 --> 45:18.464
<i>♪ She stands in

45:20.151 --> 45:24.469
<i>♪ And if I weren't so ugly</i>

45:26.158 --> 45:31.677
<i>♪ She'd possibly

45:37.369 --> 45:40.084
Brings back memories.

45:44.243 --> 45:46.225
<i>Gracias.</i>

46:17.143 --> 46:19.475
Wait. What happened?

46:19.477 --> 46:21.512
He's been forgotten.

46:21.514 --> 46:23.078
When there's no one left
in the living world

46:23.080 --> 46:24.414
who remembers you...

46:24.416 --> 46:27.216
you disappear
from this world.

46:27.218 --> 46:30.153
We call it
the final death.

46:30.155 --> 46:32.355
Where did he go?

46:32.357 --> 46:33.624
No one knows.

46:33.626 --> 46:37.828
But I've met him. I could
remember him when I go back!

46:37.830 --> 46:40.164
No, it doesn't work
like that, <i>chamaco.</i>

46:40.166 --> 46:43.132
Our memories,
they have to be passed down

46:43.134 --> 46:44.968
by those
who knew us in life...

46:44.971 --> 46:48.839
in the stories
they tell about us.

46:48.841 --> 46:51.690
But there's no one left alive
to pass down Cheech's stories.

46:54.012 --> 46:56.179
Hey, it happens
to everyone eventually.

46:56.181 --> 46:59.163
Come on, de la Cruzcito,
you've got a contest to win.

47:11.264 --> 47:13.263
You told me
you hated musicians.

47:13.266 --> 47:14.566
You never said you were one.

47:14.568 --> 47:17.033
How do you think I
knew your great-great-grandpa?

47:17.035 --> 47:18.268
We used to play
music together.

47:18.271 --> 47:20.236
Taught him
everything he knows.

47:20.238 --> 47:23.506
<i>No manches!</i> You played
with Ernesto de la Cruz...

47:23.508 --> 47:25.408
the greatest musician
of all time?

47:25.410 --> 47:27.176
Ah, you're funny.

47:27.178 --> 47:29.145
Greatest eyebrows
of all time maybe.

47:29.147 --> 47:31.147
But his music?
Eh, not so much.

47:31.149 --> 47:33.331
You don't know
what you're talking about.

47:35.288 --> 47:38.254
Welcome
to the Plaza de la Cruz!

47:38.256 --> 47:40.505
Showtime, <i>chamaco!</i>

47:46.531 --> 47:49.916
<i>Llevelo!</i>
T-shirts! Bobbleheads!

47:56.174 --> 47:59.910
<i>Bienvenidos a todos!</i>

47:59.912 --> 48:01.911
Oh!

48:01.913 --> 48:06.449
Who's ready for some <i>musica?</i>

48:06.451 --> 48:09.085
It's a battle
of the bands, <i>amigos.</i>

48:09.087 --> 48:12.155
The winner gets to play
for the maestro himself,

48:12.157 --> 48:14.190
Ernesto de la Cruz...

48:14.192 --> 48:17.027
at his <i>fiesta</i> tonight!

48:17.029 --> 48:18.560
That's our ticket, <i>muchacho.</i>

48:18.562 --> 48:20.697
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

48:20.699 --> 48:23.600
Let the competition begin!

48:40.118 --> 48:42.186
So, what's the plan?
What are you gonna play?

48:42.188 --> 48:43.585
Definitely <i>Remember Me.</i>

48:43.587 --> 48:44.987
No! Not that one. No.

48:44.990 --> 48:47.056
Come on.
It's his most popular song!

48:47.058 --> 48:48.358
Ah, it's too popular.

48:48.360 --> 48:50.461
<i>♪ Remember me
Though I have to travel far ♪</i>

48:50.463 --> 48:51.627
<i>♪ Remember me... ♪</i>

48:51.630 --> 48:53.629
<i>♪ Don't let it
make you cry... ♪</i>

48:58.204 --> 49:01.638
- What about <i>Poco Loco?</i>
- <i>Epa!</i> Now that's a song!

49:01.641 --> 49:03.540
De la Cruzcito?
You're on standby.

49:03.542 --> 49:05.557
Los Chachalacos,
you're up next.

49:06.746 --> 49:08.645
Los Chachalacos!

49:19.759 --> 49:21.758
You always this nervous
before a performance?

49:21.760 --> 49:25.094
I don't know.
I've never performed before.

49:25.096 --> 49:27.030
What? You said
you were a musician!

49:27.032 --> 49:28.998
I am!
I mean, I will be.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.400
- <i>Ay!</i>
- Once I win.

49:30.402 --> 49:33.002
That's your plan?
No. You have to win.

49:33.004 --> 49:34.571
Your life
literally depends on...

49:34.574 --> 49:36.139
you winning. And you've
never done this before!

49:36.141 --> 49:37.306
I'll go up there.

49:37.309 --> 49:39.641
- No! I need to do this.
- Why?

49:39.643 --> 49:42.111
If I can't go out
and play one song,

49:42.113 --> 49:44.013
how can I call
myself a musician?

49:44.015 --> 49:45.382
What does that matter?

49:45.384 --> 49:47.283
Because I don't just want to
get de la Cruz's blessing...

49:47.285 --> 49:51.789
I need to prove
that I'm worthy of it.

49:51.791 --> 49:54.691
Oh, that's such
a sweet sentiment

49:54.693 --> 49:57.161
at such a bad time!

49:59.464 --> 50:01.730
Okay! Okay.
You want to perform?

50:01.732 --> 50:03.534
Then you got to perform!

50:03.536 --> 50:06.537
First, you have to loosen up.
Shake off those nerves.

50:10.674 --> 50:12.275
Now give me
your best <i>grito.</i>

50:12.277 --> 50:15.026
- My best <i>grito?</i>
- Come on, yell! Belt it out.

50:18.184 --> 50:21.633
Ah, it feels good.
Okay, now you.

50:26.626 --> 50:28.640
Oh, come on, kid.

50:39.337 --> 50:41.304
De la Cruzcito,
you're on now!

50:41.306 --> 50:43.574
Miguel, look at me.
Hey, look at me.

50:43.576 --> 50:44.774
You can do this.

50:44.776 --> 50:47.311
Grab their attention
and don't let it go.

50:47.313 --> 50:49.511
Make them listen, <i>chamaco.</i>
You've got this.

50:49.513 --> 50:52.115
De la Cruzcito

51:00.659 --> 51:03.326
What's he doing?
Why isn't he playing?

51:03.328 --> 51:05.627
Bring back
the singing dogs!

51:17.677 --> 51:20.827

Not so bad yourself,
<i>gordito! Eso!</i>

53:20.598 --> 53:23.080
What? Are you crazy? We're
about to win this thing.

53:24.237 --> 53:25.768
<i>Damas y caballeros,</i>

53:25.770 --> 53:27.804
I have an emergency
announcement.

53:27.806 --> 53:31.507
Please be on the lookout
for a living boy.

53:31.509 --> 53:33.408
Answers to the name
of Miguel.

53:33.410 --> 53:36.646
Earlier tonight
he ran away from his family.

53:36.648 --> 53:39.781
They just want to send him back
to the Land of the Living.

53:39.783 --> 53:41.350
Wait, wait.

53:41.353 --> 53:43.019
You said de la Cruz
was your only family.

53:43.021 --> 53:44.953
The only person
who could send you home.

53:44.955 --> 53:46.121
I do have other family,
but...

53:46.123 --> 53:48.390
You could have taken my
photo back this whole time?

53:48.392 --> 53:51.362
But they hate music!
I need a musician's blessing.

53:51.364 --> 53:53.663
- You lied to me!
- Oh, you're one to talk.

53:53.665 --> 53:55.665
Look at me.
I'm being forgotten, Miguel.

53:55.667 --> 53:57.667
I don't even know
if I'm gonna last the night.

53:57.669 --> 53:59.035
I'm not gonna
miss my one chance

53:59.037 --> 54:00.104
to cross that
bridge because...

54:00.106 --> 54:03.307
you want to live out
some stupid musical fantasy.

54:03.309 --> 54:04.406
It's not stupid!

54:04.408 --> 54:05.641
I'm taking you
to your family.

54:05.644 --> 54:06.877
- Let go of me!
- You'll thank me later.

54:06.879 --> 54:10.380
You don't want to help me.
You only care about yourself!

54:10.382 --> 54:13.515
Keep your dumb photo.
Stay away from me!

54:13.517 --> 54:15.952
No!

54:15.954 --> 54:19.170
Hey, <i>chamaco!</i>
Where did you go?

54:20.325 --> 54:23.975
<i>Chamaco!</i> I'm sorry!
Come back!

54:33.571 --> 54:38.440
Dante, <i>callate!</i> No!
Dante, stop it.

54:38.442 --> 54:39.857
He can't help me.

54:41.578 --> 54:42.944
Dante! Stop!

54:42.946 --> 54:45.480
Stop it! Leave me alone!

54:45.482 --> 54:47.617
You're not a spirit guide.
You're just a dumb dog!

54:47.619 --> 54:49.819
Now get out of here!

54:49.821 --> 54:52.622
- It's him!
- It's that living boy!

54:52.624 --> 54:54.624
- I heard about him. Look!
- He's alive!

54:54.626 --> 54:56.826
- He's alive.
- The boy is alive!

55:06.004 --> 55:08.706
This nonsense
ends now, Miguel!

55:08.708 --> 55:11.574
I am giving you my blessing
and you are going home.

55:11.576 --> 55:13.225
I don't want your blessing!

55:14.379 --> 55:16.360
Miguel, stop!

55:18.515 --> 55:22.366
Come back! Miguel!

55:26.790 --> 55:28.890
I am trying
to save your life!

55:28.892 --> 55:31.027
- You're ruining my life!
- What?

55:31.029 --> 55:33.596
Music's the only thing
that makes me happy.

55:33.598 --> 55:35.765
And you want to
take it away.

55:35.767 --> 55:38.049
You'll never understand.

55:41.005 --> 55:45.875
<i>♪ Y aunque la vida
me cueste, Llorona</i>

55:45.877 --> 55:49.961
<i>♪ No dejare de quererte... ♪</i>

55:50.915 --> 55:53.015
I thought you hated music.

55:53.018 --> 55:58.654
Oh, I loved it!
I remember that feeling...

55:58.657 --> 56:02.424
when my husband would play,
and I would sing

56:02.426 --> 56:05.075
and nothing else mattered.

56:06.030 --> 56:08.431
But when we had Coco,

56:08.433 --> 56:10.933
suddenly there was something
in my life that...

56:10.935 --> 56:17.073
mattered more than music.
I wanted to put down roots.

56:17.075 --> 56:20.125
He wanted
to play for the world.

56:21.078 --> 56:24.580
We each made a sacrifice
to get what we wanted.

56:24.582 --> 56:26.915
Now you must make a choice.

56:26.917 --> 56:29.819
But I don't
want to pick sides!

56:29.821 --> 56:32.187

01:03:54.265 --> 01:03:56.966

you'd take back my photo.

01:04:30.167 --> 01:04:31.567

01:04:31.569 --> 01:04:33.603
You know this, uh, man?

01:04:33.605 --> 01:04:37.355
Uh, I just met him tonight.
He told me he knew you.

01:04:37.575 --> 01:04:39.608
Hector?

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:42.893
Please, Miguel.
Put my photo up.

01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:49.052
My friend,
you're being forgotten.

01:04:49.054 --> 01:04:50.685
- And whose fault is that?
- Hector, please...

01:04:50.688 --> 01:04:53.489
Those were my songs you took.
My songs that made you famous.

01:04:53.491 --> 01:04:54.556
What?

01:04:54.558 --> 01:04:56.190
If I'm being forgotten,
it's because you never

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:58.061
told anyone
that I wrote them!

01:04:58.063 --> 01:05:01.297
That's crazy! De la Cruz
wrote all his own songs.

01:05:01.299 --> 01:05:03.198
You want to tell him
or should I?

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.600
Hector, I never meant
to take credit.

01:05:05.602 --> 01:05:09.171
We made a great team,
but you died...

01:05:09.173 --> 01:05:11.205
and I only sang your songs

01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:14.208
because I wanted to keep
a part of you alive.

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:15.944
Oh, how generous!

01:05:15.946 --> 01:05:18.180
You really did
play together.

01:05:18.182 --> 01:05:20.515
I don't want
to fight about it.

01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:22.350
I just want you
to make it right.

01:05:22.353 --> 01:05:26.403
Miguel can put my photo up, and
I can cross over the bridge.

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:29.123
I can see my girl.

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:32.095
Ernesto,
remember the night I left?

01:05:32.097 --> 01:05:33.629
That was a long time ago.

01:05:33.632 --> 01:05:35.263
We drank together
and you told me

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:37.232
you would move
Heaven and Earth...

01:05:37.234 --> 01:05:41.204
for your <i>amigo.</i>
Well, I'm asking you to now.

01:05:41.206 --> 01:05:43.504
Heaven and Earth?
Like in the movie?

01:05:43.506 --> 01:05:46.241
- What?
- That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

01:05:46.243 --> 01:05:48.744
In the de la Cruz movie,
<i>El Camino a Casa.</i>

01:05:48.746 --> 01:05:50.145
I'm talking about
my real life, Miguel.

01:05:50.147 --> 01:05:52.982
No! It's in there. Look!

01:05:52.984 --> 01:05:54.350
<i>Never were
truer words spoken.</i>

01:05:54.352 --> 01:05:57.518
<i>This calls for a toast.
To our friendship!</i>

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.222
<i>I would move Heaven and Earth
for you,</i> mi amigo.

01:06:00.224 --> 01:06:03.359
But in the movie, Don
Hidalgo poisons the drink.

01:06:03.361 --> 01:06:06.310
- Salud!
<i>- Poison!</i>

01:06:08.265 --> 01:06:12.769
That night, Ernesto.
The night I left...

01:06:12.771 --> 01:06:15.370
<i>We'd been performing
on the road for months.</i>

01:06:15.372 --> 01:06:16.672
<i>I got homesick...</i>

01:06:16.675 --> 01:06:18.457
<i>and I packed up my songs.</i>

01:06:19.009 --> 01:06:20.043
You want to give up now

01:06:20.045 --> 01:06:22.512
when we're this close
to reaching our dream?

01:06:22.514 --> 01:06:24.545
This was your dream.
You'll manage.

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:26.547
I can't do this
without your songs, Hector.

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:27.716
I'm going home, Ernesto.

01:06:27.718 --> 01:06:30.468
Hate me if you want,
but my mind is made up.

01:06:33.525 --> 01:06:36.793
Oh, I could never hate you.
If you must go,

01:06:36.795 --> 01:06:39.909
then I'm sending you off
with a toast.

01:06:43.466 --> 01:06:44.733
To our friendship.

01:06:44.735 --> 01:06:49.352
I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, <i>mi amigo. Salud!</i>

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:55.445
<i>You walked me
to the train station.</i>

01:06:55.447 --> 01:06:58.312
<i>But I felt
a pain in my stomach.</i>

01:06:58.314 --> 01:07:00.582
<i>I thought it must have been
something I ate.</i>

01:07:00.584 --> 01:07:03.086
Perhaps it was
that <i>chorizo,</i> my friend.

01:07:03.088 --> 01:07:05.636
<i>Or something I drank.</i>

01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:10.908
<i>I woke up dead.</i>

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:14.763
You poisoned me.

01:07:14.765 --> 01:07:18.300
You're confusing movies
with reality, Hector.

01:07:18.302 --> 01:07:21.951
All this time, I thought
it was just bad luck.

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:27.058
<i>I never thought that

01:07:30.849 --> 01:07:32.714

01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:34.066

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:38.803
You took everything
away from me! You rat!

01:07:39.757 --> 01:07:43.325
Have him taken care of.
He's not well.

01:07:43.327 --> 01:07:48.112
I just wanted to go back home.
No! No!

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:52.601
I apologize.
Where were we?

01:07:52.603 --> 01:07:54.803
You were going to give me
your blessing.

01:07:54.805 --> 01:07:57.456
Yes. Uh, <i>si.</i>

01:08:00.377 --> 01:08:04.212
Miguel, uh,
my reputation...

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:07.683
It is
very important to me.

01:08:07.686 --> 01:08:09.786
I would hate
to have you think...

01:08:09.788 --> 01:08:13.821
That you murdered Hector
for his songs?

01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:18.559
You don't think that.
Do you?

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:23.546
I... No. Everyone
knows you're the good guy.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:32.857
<i>Papa</i> Ernesto, my blessing?

01:08:34.812 --> 01:08:39.581
Security? Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:42.719
What? But I'm your family!

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.287
And Hector
was my best friend.

01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:48.689
Success doesn't
come for free, Miguel.

01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:50.858
You have to be willing to do
whatever it takes

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:54.328
to seize your moment.

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:55.912
I know you understand.

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.848
No! No!

01:09:00.537 --> 01:09:03.471
Let go! No!

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:30.233
Help!
Can anyone hear me?

01:09:30.234 --> 01:09:32.683
I want to go home.

01:09:51.221 --> 01:09:52.889
- Hector?
- Kid?

01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:55.756
Oh, Hector!
You were right.

01:09:55.758 --> 01:09:58.360
I should have gone
back to my family.

01:09:58.362 --> 01:10:00.929
They told me not
to be like de la Cruz,

01:10:00.931 --> 01:10:02.764
but I didn't listen.

01:10:02.766 --> 01:10:05.766
I told them I didn't care
if they remembered me.

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:09.337
I didn't care if I was
on their stupid <i>ofrenda.</i>

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:12.241
Hey, <i>chamaco.</i>
It's okay. It's okay.

01:10:12.243 --> 01:10:14.860
I told them I didn't care.

01:10:18.549 --> 01:10:21.731
Hector! Hector?

01:10:22.418 --> 01:10:25.654
She's forgetting me.

01:10:25.656 --> 01:10:28.938
- Who?
- My daughter.

01:10:31.362 --> 01:10:35.796
She's the reason you wanted
to cross the bridge.

01:10:35.798 --> 01:10:39.301
I just wanted
to see her again.

01:10:39.303 --> 01:10:41.986
I never should have
left Santa Cecilia.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.040
I wish I could apologize.

01:10:45.042 --> 01:10:49.044
I wish I could tell her that her
<i>papa</i> was trying to come home.

01:10:49.046 --> 01:10:51.630
That he loved her so much.

01:10:53.951 --> 01:10:55.865
My Coco...

01:10:57.788 --> 01:10:59.603
Coco?

01:11:15.472 --> 01:11:18.806
Where did you get this?

01:11:18.808 --> 01:11:22.625
That's my <i>Mama</i> Coco.
That's my <i>Mama</i> Imelda.

01:11:23.579 --> 01:11:26.664
Is that you?

01:11:30.321 --> 01:11:33.803
- We're...
- Family?

01:11:46.004 --> 01:11:48.703
I always hoped
I'd see her again.

01:11:48.706 --> 01:11:51.105
That she'd miss me.

01:11:51.107 --> 01:11:55.191
Maybe put up my photo.
But it never happened.

01:11:56.348 --> 01:11:58.479
You know the worst part?

01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:00.748
Even if I never got to see
Coco in the living world...

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:04.353
I thought at least
one day I'd see her here.

01:12:04.356 --> 01:12:06.070
Give her the biggest hug.

01:12:08.026 --> 01:12:11.859
But she's the last person
who remembers me.

01:12:11.861 --> 01:12:14.129
The moment she's gone
from the living world...

01:12:14.131 --> 01:12:18.033
You disappear...
from this one.

01:12:18.035 --> 01:12:19.900
You'll never get to see her.

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:21.919
Ever again.

01:12:24.908 --> 01:12:28.043
You know,
I wrote her a song once.

01:12:28.045 --> 01:12:32.047
We used to sing it every
night at the same time.

01:12:32.049 --> 01:12:34.797
No matter
how far apart we were.

01:12:35.754 --> 01:12:38.420
What I wouldn't give
to sing it to her

01:12:38.422 --> 01:12:41.371
one... last... time.

01:12:43.394 --> 01:12:47.095
<i>♪ Remember me</i>

01:12:47.097 --> 01:12:51.949
<i>♪ Though I have to say
goodbye Remember me</i>

01:12:52.902 --> 01:12:55.937
<i>♪ Don't let it make you cry</i>

01:12:55.939 --> 01:13:01.809
<i>♪ For even if I'm far away

01:13:01.811 --> 01:13:07.764

01:13:08.686 --> 01:13:11.051

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:12.386

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:16.739

01:13:17.593 --> 01:13:21.530

01:13:21.532 --> 01:13:27.418
<i>♪ Know that I'm with you

01:13:29.573 --> 01:13:34.057

01:13:35.979 --> 01:13:42.732
<i>♪ Remember me ♪</i>

01:13:48.491 --> 01:13:52.594
He stole your guitar.
He stole your songs.

01:13:52.596 --> 01:13:56.230
You should be the one the world
remembers, not de la Cruz!

01:13:56.232 --> 01:13:59.000
I didn't write <i>Remember Me</i>
for the world.

01:13:59.003 --> 01:14:00.918
I wrote it for Coco.

01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:05.607
I'm a pretty sorry excuse
for a great-great-grandpa.

01:14:05.609 --> 01:14:08.876
Are you kidding? A minute ago I
thought I was related to a murderer.

01:14:08.878 --> 01:14:11.145
You're a total upgrade.

01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:13.782
My whole life,
there's been something...

01:14:13.784 --> 01:14:15.516
that made me different.

01:14:15.518 --> 01:14:17.802
And I never knew
where it came from.

01:14:18.622 --> 01:14:22.157
But now I know.
It comes from you.

01:14:22.159 --> 01:14:27.028
I'm proud we're family!
I'm proud to be his family!

01:14:34.038 --> 01:14:36.805
I'm proud to be
his family!

01:14:51.754 --> 01:14:53.654
Dante?

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:56.090
Dante!

01:14:58.662 --> 01:15:00.244
It's Dante!

01:15:11.842 --> 01:15:15.126
- Imelda!
- Hector.

01:15:15.547 --> 01:15:17.128
You look good.

01:15:28.293 --> 01:15:31.560
Dante! You knew he was my
<i>Papa</i> Hector the whole time!

01:15:31.562 --> 01:15:33.563
You are a real spirit guide.

01:15:33.565 --> 01:15:36.096
Who's the good spirit guide?
You are!

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:48.325
Whoa!

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:57.267
Dante!

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:22.211
There they are!

01:16:22.213 --> 01:16:26.564
Miguel! Miguelito! Look, it's Miguel!
He's all right.

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:31.067
<i>Gracias, Dios mio.
Que bueno.</i>

01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:47.202
<i>Mijo,</i> I was so worried!

01:16:47.204 --> 01:16:49.453
Thank goodness
we found you in time.

01:16:50.406 --> 01:16:53.942
And you... How many times
must I turn you away?

01:16:53.944 --> 01:16:55.210
Imelda.

01:16:55.212 --> 01:16:58.412
I want nothing to do with you!
Not in life, not in death!

01:16:58.414 --> 01:17:02.050
I spent decades protecting
my family from your mistakes.

01:17:02.052 --> 01:17:04.051
He spends
five minutes with you

01:17:04.053 --> 01:17:05.787
and I have to fish him
out of a sinkhole!

01:17:05.789 --> 01:17:07.322
I wasn't in there
because of Hector.

01:17:07.324 --> 01:17:09.957
He was in there
because of me.

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:12.227
He was just
trying to get me home!

01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:16.697
I didn't want to listen,
but he was right.

01:17:16.699 --> 01:17:18.982
Nothing's more
important than family.

01:17:19.937 --> 01:17:22.620
I'm ready
to accept your blessing.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.072
And your conditions.

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:27.375
But first,
I need to find de la Cruz.

01:17:27.378 --> 01:17:29.243
To get Hector's photo.

01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:30.945
- What?
- So he can see Coco again.

01:17:30.947 --> 01:17:32.847
Hector should be
on our <i>ofrenda.</i>

01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:34.315
He's part of our family.

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:35.783
He left this family!

01:17:35.785 --> 01:17:37.452
He tried to go home
to you and Coco.

01:17:37.454 --> 01:17:39.436
But de la Cruz
murdered him!

01:17:40.391 --> 01:17:42.239
It's true, Imelda.

01:17:42.993 --> 01:17:44.458
And so what if it's true?

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:46.962
You leave me alone
with a child to raise...

01:17:46.964 --> 01:17:49.064
and I'm just
supposed to forgive you?

01:17:49.066 --> 01:17:50.998
Imelda, I...

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.234
Hector!

01:17:54.838 --> 01:17:58.588
I'm running out of time.
It's Coco.

01:17:59.743 --> 01:18:01.424
She's forgetting you.

01:18:02.378 --> 01:18:05.212
You don't have
to forgive him.

01:18:05.214 --> 01:18:07.530
But we shouldn't
forget him.

01:18:09.953 --> 01:18:13.355
I wanted to forget you.

01:18:13.357 --> 01:18:16.257
I wanted Coco
to forget you too, but...

01:18:16.259 --> 01:18:19.309
This is my fault.
Not yours.

01:18:21.365 --> 01:18:23.513
I'm sorry, Imelda.

01:18:27.404 --> 01:18:31.139
Miguel, if we help you
get his photo,

01:18:31.141 --> 01:18:32.873
you will return home?

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:34.458
No more music?

01:18:35.412 --> 01:18:38.061
Family comes first.

01:18:39.749 --> 01:18:43.199
I can't forgive you.

01:18:45.422 --> 01:18:47.371
But I will help you.

01:18:48.324 --> 01:18:51.307
So, how do we get
to de la Cruz?

01:18:52.262 --> 01:18:55.078
I might know a way.

01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:48.097
- Good luck, <i>muchacho.</i>
- <i>Gracias,</i> Frida.

01:19:56.592 --> 01:19:59.861
- Here, let me help you with...
- Don't touch me!

01:19:59.863 --> 01:20:02.130
- Everyone clear on the plan?
- Find Hector's photo.

01:20:02.132 --> 01:20:03.965
- Give it to Miguel.
- Send Miguel home.

01:20:03.967 --> 01:20:05.816
Got your petals?

01:20:06.837 --> 01:20:08.469
Now, we just
have to find de la Cruz.

01:20:08.471 --> 01:20:09.786
Yes?

01:20:10.606 --> 01:20:12.556
Don't I know you?

01:20:13.409 --> 01:20:16.144
That's for murdering
the love of my life!

01:20:16.146 --> 01:20:18.212
- Who... Who the...
- She's talking about me!

01:20:18.214 --> 01:20:19.514
I'm the love of your life?

01:20:19.516 --> 01:20:21.283
I don't know.
I'm still angry at you.

01:20:21.285 --> 01:20:22.617
Hector!
How did you...

01:20:22.619 --> 01:20:25.554
And that's for trying
to murder my grandson.

01:20:25.556 --> 01:20:27.956
- Grandson?
- She's talking about me!

01:20:27.958 --> 01:20:32.126
You! Wait.
You're related to Hector?

01:20:32.128 --> 01:20:33.677
The photo!

01:20:35.398 --> 01:20:37.032
Uh...

01:20:37.034 --> 01:20:38.748
After him!

01:20:40.904 --> 01:20:43.105
Security! <i>Ayudenme!</i>

01:20:43.107 --> 01:20:46.174
- You said love of your life.
- I don't know what I said.

01:20:46.176 --> 01:20:47.590
That's what I heard.

01:21:00.891 --> 01:21:02.873
Places, <i>Senor.</i>
You're on in thirty seconds.

01:21:09.432 --> 01:21:12.349
<i>Ay!</i> Miguel! I have it!

01:21:21.044 --> 01:21:22.359
Oh!

Get her off the stage.

You still got it.

01:23:56.065 --> 01:23:58.715
Oh.

01:24:01.236 --> 01:24:04.320
Miguel,
I give you my blessing.

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:09.510
To go home,
to put up our photos

01:24:09.512 --> 01:24:11.278
and to never...

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.696
Never play music again.

01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:19.601
To never forget how much
your family loves you.

01:24:21.824 --> 01:24:23.605
You're going home.

01:24:27.130 --> 01:24:29.131
You're not going anywhere.

01:24:30.799 --> 01:24:31.867
Imelda!

01:24:31.869 --> 01:24:33.300
Stay back!
Stay back!

01:24:33.302 --> 01:24:37.537
All of you, stay back.
Not one more step.

01:24:39.308 --> 01:24:40.825
Dante!

01:24:42.212 --> 01:24:46.515
Ernesto, stop!
Leave the boy alone.

01:24:46.517 --> 01:24:48.448
I've worked too hard, Hector.

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:50.786
Too hard to let him
destroy everything.

01:24:50.788 --> 01:24:52.854
He's a living child, Ernesto.

01:24:52.856 --> 01:24:54.455
He's a threat!

01:24:54.457 --> 01:24:56.290
<i>You think
I'd let him go back</i>

01:24:56.292 --> 01:24:58.291
<i>to the Land of the Living
with your photo?</i>

01:24:58.293 --> 01:25:01.363
To keep
your memory alive? No.

01:25:01.365 --> 01:25:04.232
- You're a coward!
- I am Ernesto de la Cruz.

01:25:04.234 --> 01:25:06.167
The greatest musician
of all time!

01:25:06.169 --> 01:25:08.135
Hector's the real musician.

01:25:08.137 --> 01:25:09.438
<i>You're just the guy
who murdered him</i>

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.671
<i>and stole his songs!</i>

01:25:10.673 --> 01:25:11.839
Murdered?

01:25:11.841 --> 01:25:13.773
I am the one
who's willing to do

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:15.792
what it takes
to seize my moment.

01:25:16.212 --> 01:25:17.927
Whatever it takes.

01:25:18.648 --> 01:25:21.415
No!

01:25:23.485 --> 01:25:25.654
Miguel!

01:25:25.656 --> 01:25:29.406
Apologies, old friend.
But the show must go on.

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:14.235
Please,
please, <i>mi familia.</i>

01:26:14.237 --> 01:26:16.304
Murderer!

01:26:16.306 --> 01:26:18.805

01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:25.881
Hey!

01:26:26.983 --> 01:26:28.498
Look!

01:26:48.638 --> 01:26:51.006
Nice kitty.

01:26:54.244 --> 01:26:58.746
Put me down! No, please! I beg of you!
Stop! Stop! No!

01:27:07.423 --> 01:27:09.038
No! No!

01:27:20.571 --> 01:27:21.868
What did I miss?

01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:23.672
Good boy, Dante!

01:27:23.674 --> 01:27:24.989
Miguel!

01:27:26.409 --> 01:27:30.746

The photo... I lost it!

Coco.

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:41.056
No! We can still
find the photo.

01:27:41.058 --> 01:27:43.007
Miguel, it's almost sunrise.

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:45.725
No, no. I can't leave you.

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:48.296
I promised
I'd put your photo up.

01:27:48.298 --> 01:27:50.431
I promised you'd see Coco.

01:27:50.433 --> 01:27:52.816
We're both
out of time, <i>mijo.</i>

01:27:53.771 --> 01:27:57.037
Oh no! No!
She can't forget you!

01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:01.223
I just wanted her to know
that I loved her.

01:28:02.378 --> 01:28:03.444
Hector!

01:28:03.446 --> 01:28:05.761
You have our blessing,
Miguel.

01:28:05.982 --> 01:28:08.516
No conditions.

01:28:08.518 --> 01:28:11.633
No! <i>Papa</i> Hector, please!

01:28:17.794 --> 01:28:18.960
Go home.

01:28:18.962 --> 01:28:22.178
I promise I won't let Coco forget you!

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:50.772
There he is!

01:28:51.793 --> 01:28:53.876
Miguel! Stop!

01:28:58.835 --> 01:29:00.401
Where have you been?

01:29:00.403 --> 01:29:02.068
I need to see
<i>Mama</i> Coco, please.

01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:05.139
What are you doing with that...
Give it to me!

01:29:05.141 --> 01:29:08.944
Miguel, stop!
Miguel! Miguel!

01:29:10.879 --> 01:29:15.416
<i>Mama</i> Coco? Can you hear me?
It's Miguel.

01:29:15.418 --> 01:29:20.086
I saw your <i>papa.</i>
Remember? <i>Papa?</i>

01:29:20.088 --> 01:29:26.494
Please! If you forget him,
he'll be gone. Forever.

01:29:26.496 --> 01:29:27.995
Miguel,
open this door!

01:29:27.997 --> 01:29:30.831
Here. This was
his guitar, right?

01:29:30.833 --> 01:29:32.315
He used to play it to you?

01:29:34.972 --> 01:29:39.005
See? There he is! <i>Papa!</i>

01:29:39.007 --> 01:29:41.223
Remember? <i>Papa?</i>

01:29:44.646 --> 01:29:45.713
Miguel!

01:29:45.715 --> 01:29:48.798
<i>Mama</i> Coco, please!
Don't forget him.

01:29:55.091 --> 01:29:57.056
What are you doing
to that poor woman?

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:58.559
It's okay, <i>Mamita.</i>
It's okay.

01:29:58.561 --> 01:29:59.827
What's gotten into you?

01:30:06.502 --> 01:30:08.170
I thought
I'd lost you, Miguel.

01:30:08.172 --> 01:30:09.836
I'm sorry, <i>Papa.</i>

01:30:09.838 --> 01:30:13.188
We're all together now.
That's what matters.

01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:15.176
Not all of us.

01:30:15.178 --> 01:30:17.577
It's okay, <i>Mamita.</i>

01:30:17.579 --> 01:30:20.829
Miguel, you apologize
to your <i>Mama</i> Coco.

01:30:22.685 --> 01:30:25.835
<i>Mama</i> Coco?

01:30:30.159 --> 01:30:32.341
Well? Apologize!

01:30:36.032 --> 01:30:38.498
<i>Mama</i> Coco?

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:42.185
Your <i>papa,</i>

<i>Papa</i> was a musician.

When I was a little girl...

The home of the esteemed

01:33:34.677 --> 01:33:36.143
The letters Hector wrote home

01:33:36.145 --> 01:33:38.312
