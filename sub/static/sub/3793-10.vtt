01:21.714 --> 01:23.579
Good morning, Mr. Murphy.
This is Amy Miller's office.

01:23.616 --> 01:25.641
I have Charlie Williams
on the line.

01:25.685 --> 01:28.347
- Can you please hold for Amy?
- Sure, what's up, Charlie?

01:28.388 --> 01:31.050
- Yo, E, what's up?
- What, are you working out?

01:31.091 --> 01:34.060
No, man, no no no.
Just was up all night.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.789
Didn't get no sleep.
A little nervous.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.592
Nothing to be nervous about.
Your script is great.

01:37.630 --> 01:39.461
Oh yeah.

01:39.499 --> 01:40.591
Jesus, Charlie.

01:41.634 --> 01:43.124
- Gentlemen.
- Hey, Amy.

01:43.169 --> 01:44.761
Hey, Amy.
What's up?

01:44.804 --> 01:46.101
I loved your script
is what's up.

01:46.139 --> 01:48.471
- Are you serious?
- That's phenomenal.

01:48.508 --> 01:49.975
Cool.
When do we shoot?

01:50.009 --> 01:52.375
Okay, slow down.
We need to cast the other roles first.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.642
- All right, we can do that.
- You got anybody in mind?

01:54.681 --> 01:56.945
I do for the owner
of the surf shop.

01:56.983 --> 01:59.679
And, Eric, I hope you don't mind that
I already spoke with him about it.

01:59.719 --> 02:02.313
- Who?
- Seth Green.

02:02.355 --> 02:05.552
- Seth Green?
- Shit, I love Seth Green.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.150
Great, we have
an overall with him,

02:07.193 --> 02:08.888
so we just think it would
be a perfect fit.

02:08.928 --> 02:11.590
- He could be. What you think, E?
- Uh-huh.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.656
Eric, he said you guys
were really good friends

02:13.700 --> 02:16.225
and that you should just
call him to lock it down.

02:16.269 --> 02:18.396
Yeah, E, I think you
should do that.

02:18.438 --> 02:19.803
You should definitely
lock it down.

02:19.839 --> 02:22.273
Lock it down.

02:24.844 --> 02:27.005
Fuck Seth Green.

02:27.046 --> 02:29.105
I still got a piece of his friend's tooth
lodged in my knuckles.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.810
Seth Green is a punk.

02:30.850 --> 02:32.841
Yeah, a punk that Charlie
and the studio want to do the show with.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.820
So I got to be professional
and put the shit aside.

02:34.854 --> 02:38.187
Hear hear, no more wasting
energy on gripes and grudges.

02:38.224 --> 02:39.782
- How you feeling?
- Rejuvenated.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.351
Did you sleep on that Tempur-Pedic
pillow I put on your bed?

02:42.395 --> 02:43.555
I sure did, Johnny.
Thank you.

02:43.596 --> 02:45.325
Oh, they dropped off
your sides this morning.

02:45.365 --> 02:46.764
Thank you, Turtle.

02:46.799 --> 02:48.892
So E's got to kiss
Seth Green's ass

02:48.935 --> 02:51.563
and we don't get to take down
the douche director.

02:51.604 --> 02:52.935
Sorry to ruin
the dream, Drama.

02:52.972 --> 02:54.701
- I don't believe it.
- What's wrong?

02:54.741 --> 02:56.368
He give away
more of your lines?

02:56.409 --> 02:58.934
No, he just cut out
most of them.

02:59.946 --> 03:02.744
Cocksucking Nazi bastard.

03:02.782 --> 03:04.841
Jesus Christ!
Is it too much to ask

03:04.884 --> 03:06.681
for a goddamn egg
in the house?

03:06.719 --> 03:08.949
- What's your problem?
- What's your problem?

03:08.988 --> 03:11.081
Be more immature.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.058
If a man can't have
breakfast cooked for him,

03:13.092 --> 03:15.754
is it too much to expect a trip
to the store so he can cook it for himself?

03:15.795 --> 03:18.787
Mom cooks us breakfast every morning.
You're always at work.

03:18.831 --> 03:20.230
Let me get
this straight.

03:20.266 --> 03:23.064
All women defend
each other blindly?

03:23.102 --> 03:25.070
- Daddy!
- There he is.

03:25.104 --> 03:28.164
Finally a man
who can understand me.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.675
Hey, Jonah, you hungry?

03:29.709 --> 03:31.199
Mm-hmm.

03:31.244 --> 03:33.508
Ah, how about...

03:33.546 --> 03:35.275
some eggs?

03:35.315 --> 03:37.044
Yes, please.

03:37.083 --> 03:38.607
You want to tell me what's
really bothering you?

03:38.651 --> 03:40.380
You would not understand.

03:40.420 --> 03:43.048
You are a delightful,
unspoiled little girl.

03:43.089 --> 03:45.819
I'm 15 and obviously
more adult than you.

03:45.858 --> 03:48.486
So what's your problem?

03:48.528 --> 03:50.291
Okay, little Miss Adult.

03:50.330 --> 03:53.697
My problem is that I can't run
my business the way I want to.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.564
Not with that woman
as my partner.

03:55.602 --> 03:58.901
Your mother controls me at home,
she controls me at work.

03:58.938 --> 04:00.565
Where can a man
be a man?

04:00.607 --> 04:02.598
A man can be a man

04:02.642 --> 04:05.270
when he stops whining
and asks for things nicely.

04:05.311 --> 04:07.939
- I asked her.
- You asked her or you told her?

04:07.981 --> 04:09.915
You need to
convince a woman.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.247
Listen, Andrew Klein
is a good agent with good clients.

04:12.285 --> 04:13.912
Barbara shouldn't
need convincing.

04:13.953 --> 04:16.250
So explain that
to her... nicely.

04:16.289 --> 04:19.257
Really?
You think that'll work?

04:19.291 --> 04:21.452
You pretended you were nice
and you got Mom.

04:21.494 --> 04:23.621
Oh, is that what
she told you? Huh?

04:23.663 --> 04:24.960
Mom said she fixed you.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.831
Ha ha ha, little man.
Girls have cooties.

04:27.867 --> 04:30.802
Nuh-uh. Mia doesn't have cooties.
I like her.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.362
No, she has cooties.
She has cooties. Come here.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.244
Oh oh, it's him.
It's him.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.110
Hello?

04:43.149 --> 04:44.980
Hello, is Seth in?

04:45.018 --> 04:47.350
- Who's calling
- It's Eric Murphy.

04:47.387 --> 04:50.049
Oh, is your pussy wet,
Eric Murphy?

04:50.089 --> 04:52.023
Come on, Seth.

04:52.058 --> 04:55.050
Tell me, Eric Murphy,
do you have a wet pussy?

04:55.094 --> 04:56.425
Well?

04:56.462 --> 04:58.430
No, Seth, I don't have
a wet pussy.

04:58.464 --> 04:59.954
My God.

04:59.999 --> 05:01.660
Well, that's too bad,

05:01.701 --> 05:03.965
because who's gonna want
to fuck your dry pussy?

05:06.272 --> 05:08.832
That's hysterical, Seth.
You want to talk about this pilot or not?

05:08.875 --> 05:11.503
I do, E, because
I really like it, man.

05:11.544 --> 05:13.409
But I got to ask, do you really feel like
we can work together

05:13.446 --> 05:15.311
after everything
that we've been through?

05:15.348 --> 05:18.044
Yeah, I can put personal
shit aside for business. Can you?

05:18.084 --> 05:20.552
I don't know. I don't know.
I'd really feel more comfortable

05:20.586 --> 05:22.315
if we could just meet
face to face and discuss it.

05:22.355 --> 05:23.720
I'm up in Big Bear.

05:23.756 --> 05:26.657
How about 1:00 P.M.
Village Pizza on Larchmont?

05:26.693 --> 05:28.160
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to make it, Seth.

05:28.194 --> 05:30.321
You should make it there
if you want me to do your pilot, E.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.194
Later, E!

05:32.231 --> 05:34.665
That sounded like
it went well.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.862
He wants me to drive into
the city and meet him today.

05:36.903 --> 05:38.928
- That's okay. Go.
- You sure?

05:38.971 --> 05:41.531
Yeah, I can handle
Herr Director.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.201
There he is.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.676
Should I gun it
and run him over?

05:45.712 --> 05:47.805
Or should we take the slow

05:47.847 --> 05:50.941
and painful approach
and piss in his OJ?

05:50.983 --> 05:53.383
It's cool, guys.
I got this.

05:53.419 --> 05:56.183
Yo, E, why don't you
go get us a TV show

05:56.222 --> 05:58.816
just in case I don't
have a career as a silent film star?

05:58.858 --> 06:00.223
All right, I'll talk
to you guys later.

06:00.259 --> 06:01.920
Call me if you
need reinforcements.

06:01.961 --> 06:03.451
I can be down there
in two and a half hours.

06:03.496 --> 06:05.361
- Thanks, Drama.
- Morning, Vincent.

06:05.398 --> 06:07.366
- What a wonderful day.
- Not really.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.425
No?

06:09.469 --> 06:12.336
I'm sorry to hear that.
Can I help you?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.272
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Of course.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.865
What's troubling you?

06:15.908 --> 06:18.604
Well, I'm not
exactly happy

06:18.644 --> 06:20.339
with the way things
are starting off.

06:20.380 --> 06:24.111
Ah, don't you think it's
just the insecurities of an artist?

06:24.150 --> 06:25.674
I have those days myself.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.243
No, I'm speaking more to
the fact that you gave away

06:28.287 --> 06:30.653
all my lines and let me believe
that they'd been stolen.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.658
Not exactly
a good first day.

06:32.692 --> 06:34.592
I think it was a good day.

06:34.627 --> 06:37.425
It was an excellent day except
for the little misunderstanding.

06:37.463 --> 06:39.693
Is that why you took
all my lines away today?

06:42.068 --> 06:44.730
Vincent,
I don't understand

06:44.771 --> 06:47.433
why everything has
to be so personal.

06:47.473 --> 06:49.270
- Really, you don't?
- No.

06:49.308 --> 06:51.299
The captain is the leader

06:51.344 --> 06:53.312
and I needed those
lines for the leader.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.371
Well, you should have
just told me.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.542
Yes, I know I should have told you.
I'm sorry, I forgot.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.778
Are we okay?
Good?

06:59.819 --> 07:01.150
Well, what about
today's lines?

07:01.187 --> 07:03.951
Well, they're gone
but your character is in.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.550
Verner, without that big
monologue from yesterday

07:06.592 --> 07:08.253
my character has
no redemption.

07:08.294 --> 07:10.285
And without the lines
from this morning's scene

07:10.329 --> 07:12.297
he's got no point
of view either.

07:12.331 --> 07:14.993
I love your passion.
I can see that you care.

07:15.034 --> 07:16.797
You're an inspiration.

07:16.836 --> 07:18.394
That's great, but I'd like
to do the scene

07:18.438 --> 07:20.998
as it was originally intended,
as it's supposed to be.

07:23.342 --> 07:26.505
Actors and their words.

07:26.546 --> 07:28.480
I understand.
You'll have your words.

07:28.514 --> 07:29.845
You'll do the scene
as written?

07:29.882 --> 07:31.509
Yes, I'll do it as written
so we have that.

07:31.551 --> 07:34.019
Then we do it the other way
so we have that too.

07:34.053 --> 07:37.489
Okay?

07:40.426 --> 07:43.327
Any word from the Wicked
Witch of the East Wing?

07:43.362 --> 07:45.193
Shh!
She's in your office.

07:45.231 --> 07:47.222
She came over to thank you personally
for your lovely flowers.

07:47.266 --> 07:48.665
Good work, Lloyd.

07:48.701 --> 07:50.134
- And Andrew Klein called twice.
- What did he want?

07:50.169 --> 07:52.364
He wants to know if you know
any good moving companies.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.569
Good morning, Barbara.

07:55.608 --> 07:57.473
Thank you
for the flowers, Ari.

07:57.510 --> 07:59.478
Was that your idea
or Lloyd's?

07:59.512 --> 08:03.141
My partner has been named the 33rd
most powerful woman in Hollywood

08:03.182 --> 08:05.150
and you think I wouldn't
care enough to send flowers?

08:05.184 --> 08:07.345
- I'm hurt.
- Just checking.

08:07.386 --> 08:09.650
What time is the luncheon, by the way?
I'd love to show up.

08:09.689 --> 08:11.520
No men allowed.

08:11.557 --> 08:14.151
So it's more of a rugmuncheon
than a luncheon?

08:14.193 --> 08:16.753
Okay, this has been
a nice morning so far,

08:16.796 --> 08:18.855
but I'm gonna leave before
it takes a bad turn.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.525
It's not gonna take
a bad turn, Babs.

08:20.566 --> 08:23.535
I just want to apologize
for putting you on the spot last night.

08:23.569 --> 08:27.130
I don't get put on the spot,
but apology accepted.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.004
That's very kind of you.
Would you please,

08:29.041 --> 08:32.203
as a favor to me, consider meeting
Andrew and giving him a chance?

08:32.245 --> 08:35.111
- Please.
- Please?

08:35.147 --> 08:37.274
Yes, sincerely, Barbara.
Please.

08:37.316 --> 08:40.615
Okay, I'll meet
the schnook.

08:40.653 --> 08:41.881
With an open mind, please.

08:41.921 --> 08:44.219
Yes, with an open mind.

08:44.256 --> 08:45.622
But I'm not making
any promises.

08:45.658 --> 08:48.559
Okay, your consideration
is all I can ask for.

08:48.594 --> 08:50.118
Have a good day, Ari.

08:50.162 --> 08:51.993
You too.
And congrats again, Babs.

08:53.332 --> 08:54.697
You nasty twat.

08:54.734 --> 08:56.065
"I can't make any promises."

08:56.102 --> 08:58.434
"I can't make any..."
Lloyd!

08:59.872 --> 09:01.430
Call Andrew.
Tell him to clear his schedule.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.965
We got a meeting with Barbara.
We have three hours

09:04.010 --> 09:06.240
to make him look like an agent
from this side of the hill.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.373
Oh, "Extreme Makeover"
Miller Gold edition.

09:09.415 --> 09:10.746
I'm so excited!

09:36.542 --> 09:38.134
Hey, Seth.
I'm here.

09:38.177 --> 09:40.907
- Well, that is hilarious.
- Oh yeah? Why's that?

09:40.947 --> 09:44.280
Because this morning you were in
the mountains and I was in L.A.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.615
And now you're in L.A.
And I'm on the beach.

09:46.652 --> 09:48.779
Oh yeah,
that is funny, Seth.

09:48.821 --> 09:50.652
No, it's not funny.
It's hilarious.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.851
Eric, if you just had a sense
of humor, you would get that.

09:52.892 --> 09:55.452
Okay. Well, it's been great
catching up with you.

09:55.494 --> 09:57.587
Oh, so cold.
So cold, E.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.962
Listen, man, I really want
to do your guy's show.

09:59.999 --> 10:01.967
I really think it's a hit.
I just...

10:02.001 --> 10:04.526
dude, I don't want to work with a guy
that sucker punched me.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.162
I didn't
sucker punch you, Seth.

10:06.205 --> 10:08.537
We were face to face and you were
saying some not-so-nice things.

10:08.574 --> 10:10.303
You're still sensitive
about your girl Sloan?

10:10.343 --> 10:12.004
Sloan's not
my girl anymore.

10:12.044 --> 10:13.511
Really?
That's too bad.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.138
- Yeah, well...
- You know what, Eric?

10:15.181 --> 10:17.649
You should call Sloan
and you should tell her

10:17.683 --> 10:19.708
to call me and ask me
to do your show.

10:19.752 --> 10:22.220
Oh, yeah, right.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do, Seth.

10:22.254 --> 10:23.983
Well, you should do that.
That's what you will do

10:24.023 --> 10:26.719
if you want me to do your pilot.
Click.

10:29.395 --> 10:31.260
Watch how high I can go.

10:32.264 --> 10:34.289
Oh, that's great, Drama.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.267
I bet you can't do it.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.633
I don't want
to do it.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.001
Pussy.

10:39.038 --> 10:41.563
- Fine, how much?
- 50 bucks.

10:41.607 --> 10:43.097
Give me one
of these nuts.

10:45.378 --> 10:48.108
That's how it's done.
You owe me 50.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.138
Who are you people with?

10:50.182 --> 10:52.707
- We're with Vince.
- Verner, I'm Vince's brother.

10:52.752 --> 10:55.880
Maybe you
recognize me from...

10:59.125 --> 11:02.026
- Okay, you guys got to go.
- Go where?

11:02.061 --> 11:04.325
- Anywhere, but not near the monitors.
- You serious, bro?

11:04.363 --> 11:06.331
Yeah, go. Come on, you too.
Let's go.

11:06.365 --> 11:08.424
- Now.
- Come on, guys, here we go.

11:08.467 --> 11:11.436
Quiet, please.
Picture is up.

11:11.470 --> 11:13.597
- Roll camera.
- Rolling!

11:13.639 --> 11:16.039
Give me some passion
here now.

11:16.075 --> 11:18.100
And action.

11:19.578 --> 11:22.513
I have $50 for whoever
goes first.

11:22.548 --> 11:24.607
I'll give you 200
if it's you.

11:24.650 --> 11:25.947
You think I won't?

11:25.985 --> 11:27.816
I think you've never seen
something like this

11:27.853 --> 11:30.720
and you'll piss your pants
before your feet hit the skids.

11:30.756 --> 11:33.281
- What's your problem?
- What's up with you?

11:33.325 --> 11:35.850
This is serious,
you make bets and jokes.

11:35.895 --> 11:38.659
You've never seen a fire like this.
None of us have.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.030
My father did
and he's fine.

11:41.067 --> 11:43.399
If they want to laugh, let 'em.
You'll be fine.

11:43.436 --> 11:46.371
I'll give you 300 bucks
if you can guarantee that.

11:46.405 --> 11:48.236
I'll go first.

11:50.009 --> 11:51.943
Cut!

11:51.977 --> 11:53.911
Thank you.
Excellent.

11:53.946 --> 11:55.937
Now let's do
the shorter version.

11:55.981 --> 11:57.608
We didn't get
through this one.

11:57.650 --> 12:00.915
- I saw enough.
- One partial take?

12:00.953 --> 12:02.443
Vincent, I gave it a try.

12:02.488 --> 12:04.922
Give me another one.
The whole scene.

12:06.258 --> 12:07.691
Roll again.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.251
Going again.

12:09.295 --> 12:12.594
- Roll sound!
- Rolling!

12:12.631 --> 12:15.156
And action.

12:15.201 --> 12:17.965
I have $50 for whoever
goes first.

12:18.003 --> 12:19.834
I'll give you 200 if it's you.

12:19.872 --> 12:21.601
You don't think I will?

12:23.142 --> 12:25.440
- Stop freaking out.
- I just don't understand this.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.742
Is Barbara Miller some kind
of a fashion guru?

12:27.780 --> 12:30.578
Not if you ask me, she isn't.
When I think of Barbara Miller

12:30.616 --> 12:32.641
the first thing I think of
is way too much skin.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.585
You just want to make
a good first impression.

12:34.620 --> 12:37.487
That bitch knows me for 20 years.
Does she claim she doesn't know me?

12:37.523 --> 12:40.014
- No, she knows you.
- Then this is not a first impression.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.856
No, it's a first working
for her impression.

12:41.894 --> 12:43.759
Am I working for her
or am I working for you?

12:43.796 --> 12:46.822
You're working for you. Her name just
happens to appear on your check also.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.356
- Where are we going?
- Right here.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.368
- Ta-da!
- This should be cheap.

12:50.402 --> 12:52.836
Listen, it's on me.
It's a welcoming gift.

12:59.545 --> 13:01.172
- Eric.
- Jesus.

13:01.213 --> 13:04.307
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.681
What are you doing here?

13:05.718 --> 13:07.982
I just came by
to talk to you.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.885
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

13:09.922 --> 13:11.514
I mean, is this okay?
I could come back.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.115
Or call. I mean, I probably
should have called.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.593
- No, it's fine. Come in.
- Okay.

13:19.265 --> 13:21.563
Wow, the place
looks amazing.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.761
Thanks.
I've been redecorating.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.498
I think maybe
you're done.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.699
Oh, sadly
I'll never be done.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.674
- You want a drink?
- I'm okay.

13:29.708 --> 13:32.404
- Are you?
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.048
So what's up?

13:38.184 --> 13:40.516
Okay, this is...
wait, are we alone?

13:40.553 --> 13:42.453
- Is my boyfriend here?
- Yeah.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.718
- He works.
- Okay.

13:44.757 --> 13:47.089
- And we broke up.
- Really?

13:47.126 --> 13:48.525
- Mm-hmm.
- When?

13:48.561 --> 13:50.222
A couple months ago.

13:50.262 --> 13:51.923
That's too bad.
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:51.964 --> 13:54.398
Yeah, well, anyway...

13:54.433 --> 13:56.060
Actually, can I have
that water?

13:56.101 --> 13:58.069
Yeah, of course.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.871
So what did you
want to talk about?

14:02.908 --> 14:04.398
Okay, this is so stupid.

14:04.443 --> 14:07.344
Look, you're here
and you've got me curious.

14:07.379 --> 14:09.472
- So...
- Okay.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.279
I'm trying to get
a TV pilot greenlit

14:12.318 --> 14:14.411
and the studio really
really wants Seth Green.

14:14.453 --> 14:17.286
And he says the only way
he'll be in it

14:17.323 --> 14:18.620
is if you call him
and ask him to be.

14:20.826 --> 14:22.418
Is this a joke?

14:22.461 --> 14:24.224
Probably, but it's all I got.

14:24.263 --> 14:26.857
Eric, you can't
seriously be here

14:26.899 --> 14:28.526
because you want me
to call Seth Green.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.626
I told you it was stupid.
But the guy's got a thing for you.

14:30.669 --> 14:32.603
I think he's got
a thing for you

14:32.638 --> 14:34.196
and you keep
falling for it.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.572
Yeah, I know.
No, you're right.

14:36.609 --> 14:39.407
Well, you can tell me now, though.
Did you guys ever...

14:39.445 --> 14:42.039
Are you kidding?
Really?

14:42.081 --> 14:44.572
- You didn't believe me?
- No, I did. I do.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.107
I mean...

14:46.151 --> 14:48.381
look, I appreciate
the time.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.752
And the water.
Thanks.

14:50.789 --> 14:53.724
Do you want me
to call Seth Green?

14:53.759 --> 14:55.420
No no. Not at all.
It's just...

14:55.461 --> 14:57.088
I hadn't seen you in a while
and thought it was a good excuse.

14:57.129 --> 14:59.563
- Not a good one.
- Well, an excuse.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.668
You don't have
a girlfriend?

15:08.908 --> 15:11.274
Actually...

15:11.310 --> 15:13.972
I have a fiancée.
Getting married in June.

15:15.547 --> 15:17.276
I'm only kidding.

15:17.316 --> 15:19.511
I just wanted to see
if you still cared.

15:19.551 --> 15:22.349
- Can you tell if I do?
- I don't know.

15:22.388 --> 15:24.686
I probably should have let
it sit there for a little while longer.

15:24.723 --> 15:27.590
- Anyway, I've got to...
- Yeah, anyway.

15:27.626 --> 15:29.491
I've got to get
back to Big Bear.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.826
- Vince is waiting for me.
- As always.

15:33.899 --> 15:36.367
Yeah, well, we'll be back soon.
Maybe I'll call you.

15:36.402 --> 15:38.267
Maybe I'll answer.

15:38.304 --> 15:40.397
Okay, bye.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.304
Thanks for the...

15:42.341 --> 15:44.036
I'll see you.

15:46.712 --> 15:48.839
Yo, Vin.
Great job.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.678
- You killed it.
- Moving shit, bro.

15:50.716 --> 15:52.343
You guys didn't
watch either.

15:52.384 --> 15:54.011
It's not our fault.

15:54.053 --> 15:56.453
Seems Vermin's a little
possessive of video village.

15:56.488 --> 15:59.013
- Why, what happened?
- He threw us out like dogs.

15:59.058 --> 16:00.992
Here he comes.

16:01.026 --> 16:03.654
- Vincent.
- Yes, sir?

16:03.696 --> 16:05.891
You're not happy
with me.

16:05.931 --> 16:07.956
You walked off in
the middle of my take.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.831
That take was for you.
It wasn't for me.

16:09.868 --> 16:11.665
Maybe it would have been
for you if you watched it.

16:13.672 --> 16:15.731
Can we talk alone,
please?

16:21.880 --> 16:24.246
Vincent, today
I wanted your body

16:24.283 --> 16:25.944
to feel the part

16:25.985 --> 16:28.453
and not be distracted
by the words.

16:28.487 --> 16:31.012
But you wouldn't trust me.
You won't trust me.

16:31.056 --> 16:32.489
- I'm trying.
- No.

16:32.524 --> 16:34.321
You're trying to decide
what is good

16:34.360 --> 16:35.725
for Vincent Chase
the actor,

16:35.761 --> 16:37.524
not what is good
for my film.

16:37.563 --> 16:38.928
I thought it was
our film.

16:38.964 --> 16:40.932
No, it's not our film.

16:40.966 --> 16:44.197
Filmmaking is collaboration
but it's not democracy.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.397
You're on this film maybe
eight weeks.

16:46.438 --> 16:47.962
Then you fly off
to something.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.202
I work on this film
for maybe two years.

16:50.242 --> 16:53.234
It's got to be my film,
my decisions.

16:53.278 --> 16:55.769
If you trust me I will
get from you the performance

16:55.814 --> 16:58.408
that enhances my film
the most.

16:58.450 --> 17:01.248
And thus enhances
your performance the most.

17:01.286 --> 17:03.948
But you have to trust me.
You can't work against me.

17:03.989 --> 17:05.580
I understand.
I'll try.

17:05.624 --> 17:07.090
I'll do my best.
Whatever you say.

17:07.126 --> 17:08.855
Okay.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.724
That's good, Vincent.

17:10.762 --> 17:13.060
Why don't you go and change
and meet me at the screening trailer?

17:13.098 --> 17:14.588
I'll show you some dailies.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.430
I'll teach you a few things
that will be good for us.

17:16.468 --> 17:18.459
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:26.845 --> 17:28.972
- Why's everybody looking at me?
- 'Cause you look good.

17:29.014 --> 17:30.572
I feel like a douche.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.982
Andrew, my voice must be heard.
You do not look like a douche.

17:33.018 --> 17:36.181
You look like a powerful, handsome
new Miller Gold partner.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.745
You stick with me, Andrew,

17:37.790 --> 17:40.918
and that won't be the last offer
you have for a blowjob today.

17:42.094 --> 17:44.324
You guys are late.

17:44.363 --> 17:46.729
I didn't know we had
a formal time set.

17:46.765 --> 17:49.928
Wow, Babs, that color
really makes your eyes pop.

17:53.672 --> 17:55.640
So how have you
been, Andrew?

17:55.674 --> 17:57.335
Oh, I've been...
I've been good.

17:57.376 --> 17:58.502
I've been really good.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.845
- Is it hot in here?
- No.

18:03.882 --> 18:05.349
I don't think so.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.477
I've gone over
your company's numbers

18:07.519 --> 18:08.986
and it's pretty impressive
what you've done.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.251
Very impressive.
From the Valley.

18:11.290 --> 18:13.281
Can you imagine
what this guy does

18:13.325 --> 18:15.486
with a 90210 zip
on his business card?

18:15.527 --> 18:18.189
Well, some people are
big stars in the minors

18:18.230 --> 18:20.892
and can't swing the bat
when they get called up.

18:20.933 --> 18:24.198
I wouldn't consider
what I've been doing the minors, Barbara.

18:24.236 --> 18:25.498
Nor would I.

18:25.537 --> 18:27.004
Well, you represent,
it seems,

18:27.039 --> 18:28.802
every working
staff writer in town.

18:28.841 --> 18:31.605
- How did you sign them?
- Barbara.

18:31.643 --> 18:34.168
Okay, let me rephrase.

18:34.213 --> 18:37.080
How do you feel you could
tailor your successful approach

18:37.116 --> 18:39.710
to signing staff writers
to signing say...

18:39.751 --> 18:42.049
Julia Roberts?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.114
It's hot in here.

18:46.158 --> 18:48.285
Pretend I'm Julia Roberts,
Andrew.

18:48.327 --> 18:51.626
Tell me what you'd say
to impress me.

18:51.663 --> 18:53.130
What?
What do you mean?

18:53.165 --> 18:55.429
What do you mean
what do I mean?

18:55.467 --> 18:57.264
Pitch me.

18:59.505 --> 19:00.938
Wow, Julia,
it's amazing how much

19:00.973 --> 19:03.373
you look like
Eric Roberts.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.572
Do you mind if I just
step out for a moment?

19:06.612 --> 19:08.079
- Andrew.
- I just need a fucking breath.

19:08.113 --> 19:09.740
Listen, you can
use my office.

19:09.781 --> 19:12.147
- Ari.
- He just needs a fucking breath.

19:12.184 --> 19:15.483
- I need a moment.
- Lloyd, take him to my office.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.751
- Are you joking with this?
- Are you?

19:17.789 --> 19:19.814
- He's having a panic attack.
- Not he's not, and you're being mean.

19:19.858 --> 19:22.418
Not since my second husband
have I seen such a loser.

19:22.461 --> 19:24.656
- The answer is no.
- Barbara!

19:24.696 --> 19:26.391
Ari, I don't think
he's okay.

19:26.431 --> 19:27.864
- I'll be back.
- I'll be gone.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.367
You wait for me, Barbara!

19:30.536 --> 19:32.367
Oh my God, Andrew.
Andrew.

19:32.404 --> 19:34.372
I haven't had a fucking
panic attack since 1993.

19:34.406 --> 19:35.634
Just breathe.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.539
I thought this was a done
deal, not an interview.

19:37.576 --> 19:39.043
Listen, everything's
gonna be fine.

19:39.077 --> 19:41.136
My wife is already looking
for houses in Beverly Hills.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.205
My clients all think
they're repped by Miller Gold now.

19:43.248 --> 19:45.478
Oh my God.
I can't go home.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.179
Yes you can. Right after you pick out
a new fucking office.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.812
All right?
I'll be right back.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.920
Barbara!
Barbara!

19:53.959 --> 19:57.156
I'm sorry, Mr. Gold.
Ms. Miller left for her big luncheon.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.130
What's the fucking address?

19:59.164 --> 20:00.791
Why you hating on
Seth Green for, huh?

20:00.832 --> 20:02.697
I just don't believe
he wants to do it.

20:02.734 --> 20:04.759
- I feel like he's fucking with me.
- Why would he do that?

20:04.803 --> 20:06.964
- We have issues.
- Well, fix them.

20:07.005 --> 20:09.530
'Cause I think the dude
is funny, all right?

20:09.575 --> 20:12.203
And according to you,
if we get Seth Green

20:12.244 --> 20:13.575
the network
will make the show.

20:13.612 --> 20:15.637
I need this bad.
You feel me?

20:15.681 --> 20:17.649
I do.
Hold on a second, Charlie.

20:17.683 --> 20:20.481
- Hello?
- Eric, it's Amy.

20:20.519 --> 20:22.111
Just got off the phone
with Seth Green.

20:22.154 --> 20:23.644
Sounds like you guys
had a terrific call.

20:23.689 --> 20:25.987
Uh...

20:26.024 --> 20:28.720
He wants to sit down
with me you and Charlie today.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.728
Uh...

20:30.762 --> 20:32.059
Can you make it
in here by 4:00?

20:34.733 --> 20:36.291
Yeah, sure.

20:36.335 --> 20:38.565
Great.
See you here.

20:38.604 --> 20:41.164
Charlie, 4:00 PM
at the studio.

20:41.206 --> 20:43.106
Me, you, Amy
and Seth Green.

20:43.141 --> 20:45.200
- Are you for real?
- I sure am. I'll see you there.

20:49.047 --> 20:51.208
Yo, fuck you crew neck
wearing motherfuckers.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.411
I just got my own TV show.

20:53.452 --> 20:56.114
- What's your problem?
- What's up with you?

20:56.154 --> 20:58.884
Do you see what
I'm talking about?

20:58.924 --> 21:00.892
No, I don't
really see it.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.587
Look there now.

21:02.628 --> 21:06.120
You see your head?
It's leaning to the side.

21:06.164 --> 21:08.860
You look like a dog.
A dog trying to understand

21:08.900 --> 21:11.391
what it's master is saying.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.926
Really?

21:12.971 --> 21:16.202
Seems like a whole generation
of actors have taken to this

21:16.241 --> 21:19.267
George Clooney
head-tilt acting.

21:19.311 --> 21:22.974
Verner, I really
don't see a head tilt.

21:23.015 --> 21:25.210
Shall I get a protractor?
It's there.

21:25.250 --> 21:28.583
Vincent, you've developed
some bad habits.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.019
We have to
get rid of them.

21:30.055 --> 21:32.182
Okay. I mean, what other bad
habits are you seeing?

21:33.625 --> 21:34.819
You have a lip quiver.

21:39.331 --> 21:40.923
See there?

21:40.966 --> 21:43.992
Every time you pause
I see your lip quiver.

21:44.036 --> 21:47.130
And then I think,
"Why is the character's lip quivering?"

21:47.172 --> 21:49.367
Then I think,
"It's not the character's lip quivering.

21:49.408 --> 21:50.898
It's Vincent's
lip quivering."

21:50.942 --> 21:53.968
- The lip is quivering.
- I don't see it.

21:54.012 --> 21:55.775
But I see it.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.805
Tomorrow when you're
in front of my camera

21:57.849 --> 22:00.841
I want you to feel it
and I want you to get rid of it.

22:00.886 --> 22:04.344
It's an important scene.
We have to make it work.

22:04.389 --> 22:07.517
It could be
an Oscar scene, Vincent.

22:07.559 --> 22:09.925
But you have to follow me.

22:11.296 --> 22:12.854
Sir, you can't
go in there.

22:12.898 --> 22:14.923
I'm the guest
motivational speaker.

22:14.966 --> 22:16.695
...the women in this room.
So thank you.

22:21.206 --> 22:24.073
- What the hell?
- I wanted to congratulate you in person.

22:24.109 --> 22:25.576
- Ari, Ari.
- Attention, everyone.

22:25.610 --> 22:27.202
- I'd like to make a toast, ladies.
- Ari.

22:27.245 --> 22:31.204
To Barbara Miller,
number 33 on your prestigious list.

22:31.249 --> 22:33.080
And you know what?
It's actually amazing to me

22:33.118 --> 22:36.212
that at her advanced aged
this is the first time she's made the list.

22:36.254 --> 22:38.381
She probably thought
this is never gonna happen.

22:38.423 --> 22:40.357
But this little lady
is sharp.

22:40.392 --> 22:44.055
She went out and she found herself
a man to partner up with

22:44.096 --> 22:46.223
and look what she
was able to accomplish.

22:46.264 --> 22:47.595
Ari, you're making
an ass of yourself.

22:47.632 --> 22:49.259
It's gonna be
interesting though,

22:49.301 --> 22:51.201
once she's lost that man

22:51.236 --> 22:53.932
to see how she's going
to claw her way

22:53.972 --> 22:55.963
back into
this banquet room.

22:56.007 --> 22:58.908
But anyway,
cheers to you, Babs,

22:58.944 --> 23:02.641
and to all of you out there who have
saddled up next to powerful men

23:02.681 --> 23:04.774
just so that you can
stand in our way.

23:04.816 --> 23:06.807
But remember this:

23:06.852 --> 23:08.615
Although you can
stand in our way,

23:08.653 --> 23:10.985
you will never
keep us down.

23:11.022 --> 23:12.887
Thank you.

23:17.062 --> 23:20.293
Do you honestly think
this is the way to get what you want?

23:20.332 --> 23:22.391
No, I'm not trying to get what I want.
I'm taking.

23:22.434 --> 23:24.163
- Oh really? How?
- Yeah.

23:24.202 --> 23:26.170
I'm gonna split the agency
down the middle.

23:26.204 --> 23:28.263
Civil war, Babs.
Arm your troops.

23:28.306 --> 23:31.833
- All over Andrew Klein?
- No, all over your lack of respect.

23:31.877 --> 23:35.074
And you think that behaving like a spoiled
five-year-old is the way to earn it?

23:35.113 --> 23:37.047
I don't give a fuck.
Kiss my ass.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.879
Been nice knowing you.

23:38.917 --> 23:41.351
Fine, hire your buddy.

23:41.386 --> 23:43.946
But it's on your column
when he turns out to be a complete zero.

23:43.989 --> 23:46.617
- Fine.
- I want an apology.

23:46.658 --> 23:48.182
Fine.

23:48.226 --> 23:49.659
Now.

23:51.296 --> 23:52.695
Ladies, I'm sorry.

23:52.731 --> 23:55.529
I would love to congratulate
each and every one of you,

23:55.567 --> 23:58.627
but unfortunately Barbara's
cock is all I can handle.

23:58.670 --> 24:00.763
Congrats again.

24:09.848 --> 24:11.679
What up, E?

24:11.716 --> 24:13.741
What up, Seth?

24:14.886 --> 24:17.821
So, um, how do you guys
know each other anyway?

24:17.856 --> 24:19.915
- We used to date the same girl.
- No we didn't.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.619
- I didn't know you had a girl, E.
- I don't.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.821
- It was a long time ago.
- You still talk to her.

24:23.862 --> 24:25.853
No, not in a while.

24:25.897 --> 24:28.730
You talked to her today.

24:28.767 --> 24:30.667
What up, E?

24:30.702 --> 24:32.829
- How do you know I spoke to her?
- 'Cause I spoke to her.

24:32.871 --> 24:34.236
- Oh, you spoke to her?
- Yeah.

24:34.272 --> 24:36.172
Didn't you tell her
to speak to me?

24:36.208 --> 24:38.369
- Isn't that how we ended up here?
- Wait, hold on.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.970
You guys got to cut
the tension before we go in there.

24:41.012 --> 24:42.809
No no, there's no
tension, Charlie.

24:42.848 --> 24:44.713
It's just two tough
white guys

24:44.749 --> 24:46.717
being true to
their primal nature.

24:46.751 --> 24:48.548
I can't believe
she called you.

24:48.587 --> 24:50.885
She did.
And then she came over.

24:50.922 --> 24:53.720
- Don't push me, Seth.
- And if I do?

24:53.758 --> 24:55.692
We've been down that
road before, haven't we?

24:55.727 --> 24:58.719
Yes, we have. And that road ends
with you sucker punching me.

24:58.763 --> 25:01.163
Damn, E.
You sucker punched the man?

25:01.199 --> 25:03.064
Does it look like I need
to sucker punch this kid?

25:03.101 --> 25:05.092
I'll take him out in the parking lot
right now and throw him a beating.

25:05.136 --> 25:06.535
- Whoo.
- But that's what he wants.

25:06.571 --> 25:08.061
And I'm not gonna
let him get to me.

25:08.106 --> 25:09.368
I've already
gotten you to, Eric,

25:09.407 --> 25:12.399
and your impossibly hot
girlfriend multiple times.

25:13.578 --> 25:15.341
And your show is next.

25:15.380 --> 25:16.711
Hold on.
What you mean by that, Seth?

25:16.748 --> 25:18.648
Charlie, what if
I told you

25:18.683 --> 25:21.345
that I won't do your show
unless you get rid of Eric?

25:21.386 --> 25:24.480
I'd say E's my boy
and he ain't going nowhere.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.855
Maybe you are.
Maybe I'll just tell Amy

25:26.892 --> 25:28.223
that I really want
to do this show

25:28.260 --> 25:30.455
but I'd much rather do it
with my close personal friend

25:30.495 --> 25:32.224
international sensation
Nick Cannon.

25:37.068 --> 25:40.037
- You son of a bitch.
- Guys, enough. Enough enough enough.

25:40.071 --> 25:42.403
- Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, get off him.
- It's my show, motherfucker!

25:42.440 --> 25:44.908
- Motherfucker!
- Why, will you hit me?

25:44.943 --> 25:46.934
- You got to be professional.
- Shut up!

25:51.950 --> 25:53.440
You've played
this game before.

25:53.485 --> 25:56.147
Nope.
It's my natural athletic talent.

25:56.187 --> 25:58.246
I'd like to see you maneuver
your lazy ass on a real court.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.757
Oh yeah?

26:03.328 --> 26:05.296
How do you do that?
How do you hit it so hard?

26:05.330 --> 26:07.264
I don't know.
You just hit it hard. Time it.

26:09.134 --> 26:10.965
Match point.

26:12.737 --> 26:14.136
You're a cheater.
What buttons?

26:14.172 --> 26:16.106
Oh, it's not a button.
It's skill.

26:16.141 --> 26:18.507
- And you, sir, have none.
- You little shit.

26:18.543 --> 26:21.307
- Oof!
- What button is it?

26:21.346 --> 26:23.678
Hey, what's up? You guys get sick
of jerking each other off?

26:23.715 --> 26:24.943
You're crazy, Drama.

26:24.983 --> 26:27.008
Yeah, you name the sport,
I'll bust you up.

26:27.052 --> 26:29.816
A real sport, not this.

26:29.854 --> 26:31.549
So you got a TV show
or what, E?

26:31.590 --> 26:33.751
We're gonna continue to look for cast.
How'd it go here?

26:33.792 --> 26:36.625
- It's been weird today.
- Yeah.

26:36.661 --> 26:38.856
- How so?
- Yo yo!

26:38.897 --> 26:41.195
20 minutes,
it hasn't moved.

26:41.232 --> 26:44.201
- What's up?
- What's up?

26:44.235 --> 26:45.566
You tell me.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.072
Just trying to keep my head straight.
Good day?

26:48.106 --> 26:50.870
- I've seen better.
- Yeah, me too.

26:50.909 --> 26:53.776
But you know what?
Tomorrow's a new sunrise.

26:53.812 --> 26:56.610
Big scene in the morning.
Got to kill it.

26:56.648 --> 26:58.912
Need to rest.

27:06.124 --> 27:08.251
Told you it's been
a weird day.
