WEBVTT

00:27.822 --> 00:29.158
Luke!

00:29.191 --> 00:30.795
Hey, Luke, wake up!
Come on!

00:30.828 --> 00:32.197
Luke, wake up!

00:32.231 --> 00:33.568
Did we get 'em?
Is he dead?

00:33.601 --> 00:35.505
Yes.

00:35.538 --> 00:36.607
...And no.

00:38.611 --> 00:39.513
We gotta go.
Can you move?

00:39.546 --> 00:41.482
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41.517 --> 00:42.484
Run!

00:43.721 --> 00:45.390
Come on, come on!

01:10.474 --> 01:11.409
Woah!

01:11.442 --> 01:12.278
Jesus Christ!

01:12.311 --> 01:13.748
They're everywhere!

01:13.781 --> 01:15.818
Did you know we had this many
dead people in town?

01:15.852 --> 01:18.256
I never thought about
that until today.

01:25.137 --> 01:27.141
I think there's a fire escape
off that alley.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.176
If we can make it there

01:28.209 --> 01:29.345
we can take the roof tops
back towards the store.

01:29.378 --> 01:29.913
Ok.

01:29.947 --> 01:30.648
Alright, let's do this.

01:30.682 --> 01:31.550
Go, go, go.

01:42.639 --> 01:43.774
Oh, shit!

01:45.444 --> 01:47.414
Woah, woah, woah!

01:47.816 --> 01:49.118
Where's the fire escape?

01:49.151 --> 01:50.187
You said there was
a fire escape!

01:50.220 --> 01:52.358
I said I think there's
a fire escape.

01:54.161 --> 01:55.397
Oh, shit!

01:58.904 --> 02:01.376
Uh, listen. Cam?

02:01.409 --> 02:06.119
Hey, it's ok.
We're good.

02:19.278 --> 02:20.113
Mom?!

02:20.581 --> 02:22.151
Get in the car, boys.

02:27.762 --> 02:28.764
You like that?

02:28.798 --> 02:31.637
How's the second amendment
taste, motherfuckers?!

02:33.808 --> 02:35.645
Mayor Bowman,
we gotta go!

02:44.763 --> 02:46.667
Wait, Lauren,
stop the car!

02:46.700 --> 02:48.504
Why are we stopped?
Just go!

02:57.856 --> 02:59.458
That's my dad.

04:55.591 --> 04:57.695
What the hell was that?

05:12.457 --> 05:14.428
Someone's gonna have
to go down there.

05:14.696 --> 05:16.332
Where's the new guy?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.571
Blackwood!

05:20.808 --> 05:22.979
What the hell?
Why me?

05:23.012 --> 05:25.317
'Cause you're the new guy.

05:26.653 --> 05:28.657
Shit.

06:02.625 --> 06:03.661
Dammit.

06:06.198 --> 06:08.036
Oh, come on.

06:16.653 --> 06:18.089
Ahhhhhh!!!!!

06:42.805 --> 06:44.441
What the hell?

07:31.703 --> 07:33.741
Hey Dad, I'm leaving.

07:34.876 --> 07:36.780
For work.

07:38.182 --> 07:40.086
Whatever, asshole.

08:01.563 --> 08:02.565
McDermott.

08:02.598 --> 08:03.934
Sorry to wake you.

08:03.967 --> 08:06.005
No, no, I was up.

08:06.038 --> 08:08.677
Cam and I got into it
last night.

08:08.711 --> 08:09.946
Captain
College thing again?

08:09.979 --> 08:13.587
Yeah, same shit.
So what's up?

08:13.620 --> 08:16.225
Got a call from the Cleargenix
drill site.

08:16.258 --> 08:18.831
Said they found a body.
I need you to go take a look.

08:18.864 --> 08:21.002
Twenty bucks says it's one of
their dipshit frackers

08:21.035 --> 08:23.974
that came to work drunk
and took a header into a well.

08:24.008 --> 08:25.010
Don't get into the politics,

08:25.043 --> 08:26.913
just see what the hell
they're talking about, ok?

08:26.947 --> 08:31.255
Oh, and uh, just tell Cam
you're an asshole

08:31.288 --> 08:33.059
and that you're sorry.

08:33.092 --> 08:34.929
Captain He's your
son, McDermott.

08:34.963 --> 08:37.735
He's all you got left.
Don't fuck it up.

09:12.070 --> 09:14.609
No, I know you can't control
the weather, Mom.

09:14.642 --> 09:16.580
It's just, maybe if you would
have flown in

09:16.613 --> 09:19.051
a little earlier.

09:19.084 --> 09:21.222
No, no. Please don't make
this about Amy's parents

09:21.255 --> 09:22.825
and their money.

09:22.859 --> 09:24.763
Mom! Mom!

09:24.796 --> 09:27.134
No, she did not put them on
Instagram to torture you,

09:27.167 --> 09:29.138
it was her wedding shower!

09:36.152 --> 09:37.287
Mom.

09:37.320 --> 09:40.961
I am getting married today
and it would mean an awful lot

09:40.995 --> 09:45.069
if you and dad could be there
so just let me know

09:45.103 --> 09:48.944
the minute your plane
can take off, ok?

09:48.977 --> 09:50.915
Yeah, I love you, too.

09:58.997 --> 10:01.636
I am in control
of my life.

10:01.670 --> 10:02.471
I am in control of my life.

10:02.505 --> 10:03.172
By the choices
I make.

10:03.206 --> 10:05.276
By the choices I make.

10:05.310 --> 10:07.782
I am a powerful
presence.

10:07.815 --> 10:11.723
I am a powerful presence!

10:11.857 --> 10:13.326
Jesus Christ!

10:15.865 --> 10:18.369
I am calm
and relaxed.

10:18.402 --> 10:23.179
I am calm and relaxed.

11:15.016 --> 11:17.354
Sweetheart?

11:17.387 --> 11:20.059
Today is a very big day,

11:20.093 --> 11:23.299
not just for me but
for our entire family.

11:23.332 --> 11:27.942
I'm in a very tight race
and it would be unfortunate

11:27.975 --> 11:30.480
if the mayor's son got caught
drinking underage

11:30.514 --> 11:32.952
with his dickhead friends.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.937
Do we have an understanding?

11:41.970 --> 11:43.406
Yes, ma'am.

11:43.439 --> 11:46.913
Oh, m'gosh, I sure do
appreciate it.

11:46.947 --> 11:48.149
Great.

11:48.482 --> 11:51.121
Oh, and Luke, honey,
you're 18 now.

11:51.155 --> 11:53.159
Don't forget to vote.

11:53.192 --> 11:55.163
Who should I vote for?

12:03.145 --> 12:05.049
Are you in charge
of this site?

12:05.083 --> 12:06.018
No.

12:06.051 --> 12:07.087
Then why the hell do you think
it was your job

12:07.120 --> 12:09.224
to call the cops?

12:09.258 --> 12:10.159
We found a body.

12:10.193 --> 12:11.997
That's what you're supposed
to do.

12:12.030 --> 12:14.334
Oh really, Blackwood?

12:14.368 --> 12:17.040
You find a lot of dead bodies
in your life?

12:17.073 --> 12:18.075
No.

12:18.109 --> 12:20.480
Then how do you know
what you're supposed to do?

12:22.183 --> 12:24.822
Half the town doesn't want us
here as it is.

12:24.856 --> 12:27.127
They think we're contaminating
their water,

12:27.160 --> 12:29.966
causing earthquakes
or some bullshit,

12:29.999 --> 12:31.836
and the last thing
we need to do

12:31.870 --> 12:34.107
is give them a reason
to shut us down.

12:34.141 --> 12:37.848
You weren't there!
You didn't see it!

12:37.882 --> 12:41.355
That's a person and somebody did
some messed up shit to him!

12:41.388 --> 12:42.525
We're on a time table.

12:42.558 --> 12:44.328
We go off schedule,
it's my ass!

12:44.361 --> 12:47.535
I'm sorry but I can't un‐call
the police!

12:47.568 --> 12:49.171
They're on their way.

12:52.812 --> 12:53.981
You're right.

12:54.014 --> 12:57.521
Um... I'm under a lot
of pressure

12:57.555 --> 13:02.497
and you did the right thing,
ok?

13:02.531 --> 13:05.571
Why don't you take the rest
of the day off?

13:05.604 --> 13:07.575
Rhodes, I'm fine.
I can work.

13:07.608 --> 13:08.710
Well, we don't even know

13:08.744 --> 13:11.048
when we're gonna be up
and running again,

13:11.081 --> 13:15.390
and besides, after what
you've been through

13:15.423 --> 13:19.264
you deserve a break, hmm?

13:19.297 --> 13:20.834
See you tomorrow?

13:22.070 --> 13:23.105
Hmm?

13:28.349 --> 13:30.053
Hey.

13:30.086 --> 13:31.355
I'll deal with the police.

13:31.388 --> 13:37.000
I want the men back to work
and making holes by lunch!

13:57.240 --> 13:58.242
Hey Lauren,

13:58.275 --> 14:00.313
smoking that cigarette
makes you look real cool.

14:01.448 --> 14:02.618
Thanks, Cam.

14:02.651 --> 14:07.293
I've always wanted cool tips
from a guy wearing cargo shorts.

14:07.327 --> 14:08.462
Why aren't you at school?

14:08.496 --> 14:10.466
Senior skip day.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.037
And you're here mowing
the lawn?

14:12.070 --> 14:13.439
Mmmhmm.

14:13.472 --> 14:14.441
Don't you have any friends?

14:14.474 --> 14:16.278
I'm trying to make as much money
as I can

14:16.311 --> 14:17.447
before the end of summer.

14:17.480 --> 14:18.950
I barely have enough to pay
for first semester as it is.

14:18.984 --> 14:21.990
Dad's still not down with
the whole Hawaii thing, huh?

14:22.023 --> 14:23.092
That depends.

14:23.125 --> 14:24.494
Ripping my acceptance letter
in half and throwing it

14:24.529 --> 14:27.233
in the garbage in front of
my face sound down to you?

14:27.267 --> 14:28.402
It does not.

14:32.578 --> 14:33.479
Great.

14:33.513 --> 14:35.149
Wasted my whole smoke break
talking to you.

14:35.183 --> 14:38.255
Ahhh, so I'm saving you
from lung cancer.

14:38.289 --> 14:39.491
Would you call me your hero?

14:39.525 --> 14:45.403
No, I'd call you the asshole
who made me miss my smoke break.

14:45.436 --> 14:47.173
This uh, this thing we do,

14:47.207 --> 14:48.442
it's gonna be one of the things
I miss most

14:48.476 --> 14:50.981
when I get out of this
shit‐hole town.

14:51.014 --> 14:51.950
Don't kid yourself.

14:51.983 --> 14:54.622
You're never getting out
of this shit‐hole town.

15:02.671 --> 15:04.942
Is there a body under there?

15:04.976 --> 15:09.484
No, it's a six‐foot party
sub named... Jerry.

15:10.486 --> 15:13.560
I do not know how you work
with dead bodies.

15:13.593 --> 15:17.066
I'll take the dead
over the living any day.

16:33.452 --> 16:33.954
Jesus!

16:33.987 --> 16:36.458
Lauren, take it easy.

16:36.491 --> 16:38.597
Why are you creeping up
on me?

16:38.630 --> 16:42.270
I'm not creeping up on you,
I'm checking up on you, hmm?

16:42.303 --> 16:44.307
See how everything's going.

16:45.777 --> 16:48.415
Look at this piece of crap.

16:48.449 --> 16:50.219
Think of the poor wife, hmm?

16:50.253 --> 16:52.691
Could you imagine doing it
with this guy?

16:52.725 --> 16:55.196
I'd rather not.

16:56.666 --> 16:58.269
Oh, hey, I gotta run out
a little bit later.

16:58.302 --> 16:59.304
Do you think you can take care

16:59.337 --> 17:01.776
of this bastard's services
on your own?

17:01.809 --> 17:04.247
My first solo funeral?
Are you serious?

17:04.281 --> 17:06.184
Yeah, you're ready.

17:06.218 --> 17:09.157
Lazlo, this is awesome.
Thank you.

17:09.190 --> 17:11.461
Hey, maybe we can go out
for drinks tonight.

17:11.495 --> 17:12.497
We can celebrate.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.138
Lazlo, I'm 90 days sober.

17:16.171 --> 17:19.779
Congratulations, there's another
reason to celebrate.

17:19.812 --> 17:20.714
Look.

17:22.685 --> 17:24.354
Bro.

17:24.387 --> 17:26.391
Um, it's not you,

17:26.425 --> 17:29.064
I just have this strict
no boning my boss policy.

17:29.097 --> 17:30.534
Huh.

17:30.567 --> 17:32.103
Also, it's a little bit you.

17:33.205 --> 17:37.313
Well hey, that's cool.
I just thought it'd be nice.

17:40.253 --> 17:43.425
Oh, uh, I can't believe I forgot
to tell you this.

17:43.459 --> 17:45.597
I got a message from
your parole officer,

17:45.631 --> 17:46.633
he wants me to call
him back.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.837
Probably just wants
to check up on

17:48.870 --> 17:50.707
how everything's going
at work.

17:50.741 --> 17:58.222
Make sure I'm... satisfied
with your performance.

17:58.255 --> 17:59.558
I better go call him.

18:04.167 --> 18:04.802
Lazlo!

18:07.508 --> 18:11.649
One drink, and I'm getting
a Diet Coke.

18:11.683 --> 18:13.185
It's a date.

18:38.937 --> 18:40.641
Yo, I can't believe
you got busted.

18:40.674 --> 18:42.578
I told everybody we're
pulling up with brews.

18:42.611 --> 18:44.314
Please don't call them brews,
ok man?

18:44.347 --> 18:45.517
You sound like my dad.

18:45.550 --> 18:47.721
Do you know what the difference
is between me and your dad?

18:47.755 --> 18:50.126
He's got a fridge
full of brews.

18:51.596 --> 18:55.269
And... he gets to plug
your mom.

18:55.303 --> 18:56.906
Damn, she is fine
for an old lady.

18:56.939 --> 18:59.679
Yeah, well, she'd probably
blow you for your vote.

18:59.712 --> 19:01.481
What, are you serious?

19:01.516 --> 19:03.152
Oh, damn.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.287
I wish I was old enough
to vote.

19:04.321 --> 19:05.456
Man, she's so up my ass

19:05.489 --> 19:08.630
about not embarrassing
the family, you know?

19:08.663 --> 19:11.736
She thinks she's like
a Bush or something.

19:11.769 --> 19:13.506
Ok, well now I can't stop
thinking about her‐

19:13.540 --> 19:14.775
Dude, if you say "bush"
I swear to god

19:14.809 --> 19:16.779
I will kick you out of this car
right now, man.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.618
Look man, relax, ok?

19:19.652 --> 19:21.589
I got a cousin who works
at a liquor store.

19:21.622 --> 19:24.294
I can ask him to hook us up
with a keg or something.

19:24.327 --> 19:25.964
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

19:25.997 --> 19:27.968
'Cause he's an asshole,
that's why.

19:28.002 --> 19:30.507
Yeah, he's not the only one
in your family.

20:05.443 --> 20:07.313
Got a call about a body?

20:07.346 --> 20:07.915
Oh.

20:09.518 --> 20:10.854
That, yeah.

20:10.887 --> 20:14.427
Sorry to drag you
all the way out here.

20:14.461 --> 20:16.231
Just a dead deer.

20:16.264 --> 20:20.272
Female crew, she saw it,
freaked out.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.376
I don't know how many times
I told corporate

20:22.410 --> 20:24.849
a drill site ain't no place
for a lady.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.489
I'm here, might as well
check it out.

20:28.523 --> 20:29.725
Hey, look man.

20:29.759 --> 20:34.367
This misunderstanding, it's
really put us behind schedule,

20:34.400 --> 20:38.008
so can you just work
with me here?

20:38.041 --> 20:42.417
I ain't leaving until I see
that thing with my own eyes.

20:42.450 --> 20:46.458
You wanna get back on schedule,
I suggest you get out of my way.

20:48.696 --> 20:49.932
Have at it.

20:51.468 --> 20:54.407
Oh, but you're
gonna need this.

20:54.441 --> 20:57.480
A drill site's a
dangerous place.

20:57.514 --> 21:00.019
Hate to see anything
happen to you.

21:00.887 --> 21:02.323
Appreciate it.

21:18.055 --> 21:20.359
Shit, I'm gonna have to go
down there.

21:20.392 --> 21:22.798
You fellas got a rope
or something?

21:27.875 --> 21:29.410
Ok.

21:41.669 --> 21:42.671
Yeah?

21:42.704 --> 21:43.573
Captain Turns out
it was a false alarm.

21:43.606 --> 21:46.512
Why don't you head back
to the station?

21:46.546 --> 21:48.783
But I haven't seen it yet.
It'll take me 10 minutes.

21:48.817 --> 21:50.821
Captain I just got a call
from the mayor's office.

21:50.854 --> 21:53.392
It's been strongly suggested
that we back off

21:53.425 --> 21:55.429
so that's what we're doing.

21:55.462 --> 21:59.070
I thought you said to leave
the politics out of this.

21:59.103 --> 22:01.474
Captain
Just let it go.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.065
Thank you for coming out,
Officer.

22:13.098 --> 22:15.604
The people of Mawinhaken
sure are lucky

22:15.637 --> 22:17.708
to have you on the force.

22:18.576 --> 22:19.945
It's Detective.

22:20.847 --> 22:25.557
Have yourself a good day...
Detective.

22:31.602 --> 22:32.838
Let's go!

22:38.148 --> 22:39.585
Excuse me.

22:40.152 --> 22:42.023
Are you the one
who called it in?

22:42.056 --> 22:43.660
A lot of good it did.

22:43.693 --> 22:46.064
Looks like we're both
getting sent home.

22:46.097 --> 22:48.703
That depends.

22:48.736 --> 22:51.441
Can you get me down
in that hole?

23:05.503 --> 23:07.574
Why aren't you wearing
your gun?

23:07.608 --> 23:09.511
'Cause I'm going to vote.

23:09.545 --> 23:10.981
Jesus Christ, Trey.

23:11.014 --> 23:13.620
One of the cornerstones of
my campaign is open carry.

23:13.653 --> 23:14.622
You need to be carrying.

23:14.655 --> 23:15.924
In the open.

23:15.957 --> 23:18.997
Between you and Luke it's like
neither of you give a shit

23:19.030 --> 23:20.767
about the political future
of this family.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.403
Babe, calm down.

23:22.436 --> 23:24.842
You got nothing
to worry about.

23:24.875 --> 23:26.679
You're gonna win.

23:26.712 --> 23:28.181
Nicole says it's close.

23:28.215 --> 23:31.789
The whole town is divided
over this fracking thing.

23:31.822 --> 23:32.958
It was supposed to be
a landslide.

23:32.991 --> 23:34.728
Everything's gonna be fine.

23:34.762 --> 23:38.903
Even if you don't win,
I won't love you any less.

23:38.937 --> 23:40.774
Why do you say shit
like that?

23:40.807 --> 23:43.045
Is that supposed to make me
feel better?

23:43.078 --> 23:43.880
Christ.

23:43.913 --> 23:45.082
Mayor.

23:45.115 --> 23:46.017
Trey.

23:46.051 --> 23:46.652
Hey, Nicole.

23:46.686 --> 23:47.587
Oh, tell me something good.

23:47.621 --> 23:50.794
The press is here
ready to go live.

23:50.827 --> 23:52.631
Let's do this.

23:52.931 --> 23:54.735
I love Mawinhaken.

23:54.768 --> 23:56.037
I was born here.

23:56.071 --> 23:57.507
Raised here.

23:57.541 --> 23:59.979
And god willing,
I will die here.

24:00.012 --> 24:01.649
But hopefully not
any time soon.

24:05.924 --> 24:08.495
Now I know some of you folks
have some concerns

24:08.529 --> 24:14.508
about Cleargenix coming to town,
but fracking creates jobs.

24:14.541 --> 24:17.013
Jobs this town sorely needs.

24:17.046 --> 24:19.918
And without the money
that drilling brings in

24:19.952 --> 24:22.123
Mawinhaken would be
a ghost town.

24:22.156 --> 24:24.060
It's as simple as that.

24:24.093 --> 24:28.235
But the work here isn't done.

24:28.268 --> 24:32.043
I have been proud
to serve as your mayor

24:32.076 --> 24:33.946
for the last four years

24:33.980 --> 24:39.992
and I would be honored
to serve you for four more.

24:40.025 --> 24:43.700
Now, if you all will excuse me,
I'm gonna go vote.

24:56.892 --> 24:57.694
Hello, hello.

25:17.233 --> 25:19.237
Looking good, Jerry.

26:14.013 --> 26:16.050
Somebody there?

26:48.749 --> 26:50.987
If we have rats again...

27:27.026 --> 27:28.930
Son of a bitch!

28:02.196 --> 28:03.064
Um...

28:03.733 --> 28:06.070
Uh, these roses are white.

28:06.104 --> 28:08.976
Uh, my‐ my fiancé, she
specifically asked for‐

28:09.010 --> 28:10.178
for cream roses.

28:10.212 --> 28:13.184
I... I know most people
can't tell the difference

28:13.218 --> 28:16.124
but Amy... Amy can tell
the difference.

28:16.157 --> 28:18.763
She's very particular.

28:18.796 --> 28:21.200
Um, so I mean, if it's‐
if it's not too late

28:21.234 --> 28:22.403
maybe we could just‐

28:22.436 --> 28:23.471
Give me a hand?

28:23.506 --> 28:25.910
There's six more of these
in the back of my truck.

28:25.944 --> 28:30.787
S‐Shawn, are‐ are
those cream roses?

28:30.820 --> 28:31.755
Yeah, yeah.

28:31.789 --> 28:33.425
I had to drive to Philly
at the crack of dawn.

28:33.458 --> 28:34.460
I was dropping off chairs
last night

28:34.493 --> 28:35.930
and I saw all these
white roses

28:35.964 --> 28:40.840
and I was like Amy is gonna
flip out so I took care of it.

28:40.873 --> 28:45.516
Wow. Wow, thanks, man.
That's, um, that's huge.

28:45.550 --> 28:48.088
I'm the man of honor.

28:48.121 --> 28:50.325
Somebody's gotta keep our girl
happy, right, buddy?

30:00.132 --> 30:01.367
Hey, check it out.

30:01.401 --> 30:03.873
There's Cam.

30:03.906 --> 30:06.411
God. Man, I hate that kid.

30:06.444 --> 30:09.083
Always acting like he's better
than the rest of us.

30:09.116 --> 30:11.555
Bitching about how he can't wait
to get out of this town.

30:11.588 --> 30:12.991
Such a prick.

30:13.024 --> 30:14.928
Man, screw that guy.
Forget him.

30:18.936 --> 30:20.506
Check this out.

30:20.540 --> 30:22.109
Hey man, what're you doing?

30:23.178 --> 30:26.017
What're you doing?
Luke, what are you‐

30:27.987 --> 30:29.023
Luke!

30:35.636 --> 30:36.905
What the hell, Luke?

30:36.939 --> 30:38.909
Did I scare ya, lawn boy?

30:38.943 --> 30:40.445
I think he crapped
his cargo shorts.

30:44.086 --> 30:46.592
See you around, dickhead.

30:46.625 --> 30:47.594
Bye, loser!

30:57.580 --> 30:59.450
Oh, shit!

31:04.961 --> 31:06.464
What're we doing, bro?

31:17.052 --> 31:18.388
There he is!

31:27.039 --> 31:28.976
Goddammit! Shut it down!

32:21.147 --> 32:23.451
God.

32:23.485 --> 32:25.388
Shit.

32:53.746 --> 32:55.448
What the hell?

33:02.764 --> 33:04.200
Hey, can we go now?

33:04.233 --> 33:05.770
He's gotta be around
here somewhere.

33:05.803 --> 33:07.206
Luke.

33:07.239 --> 33:09.176
Look, forget the window.

33:09.210 --> 33:11.748
Just tell your mom that a rock
hit it or something.

33:11.782 --> 33:13.719
Man, I don't care about
the window.

33:13.752 --> 33:16.224
Ok, then why are we here?

33:16.257 --> 33:17.627
Oh, shit!

33:25.576 --> 33:28.682
Nice.

33:28.716 --> 33:31.187
You're joking.

33:31.220 --> 33:32.624
Look at my jacket.

33:34.794 --> 33:36.598
It's good.
You look good.

33:36.632 --> 33:38.034
Oh, thanks, dick.

33:40.138 --> 33:40.740
Oh my...

33:56.672 --> 33:59.778
Hi. You must be Bobby.

33:59.811 --> 34:02.349
I'm so sorry for your loss.

34:02.382 --> 34:03.519
I'm Lauren.

34:03.552 --> 34:07.527
I'll be taking care of your
grandfather's service today.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.263
Where's Lazlo?

34:09.296 --> 34:11.267
We made all the arrangements
through him.

34:11.300 --> 34:12.336
He had to step out

34:12.369 --> 34:15.408
but I assure you I have
everything under control.

34:15.442 --> 34:16.645
Huh.

34:19.350 --> 34:22.624
I'd like to see my Peepaw
before everyone arrives.

34:22.657 --> 34:24.393
Yeah, of course.

34:24.426 --> 34:25.295
Just give me a moment.

34:25.328 --> 34:26.297
Uh‐huh.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.538
Lazlo, you asshole.

34:55.488 --> 34:56.692
Hurry up!

35:13.291 --> 35:14.460
Hey! Hey!

35:14.493 --> 35:15.896
Wha‐ what're you doing?

35:15.930 --> 35:17.667
They're coming.
Just chill.

35:21.340 --> 35:23.311
I sent you home.

35:39.376 --> 35:43.384
‐It's ok. You got this.
‐Thanks, honey.

35:48.662 --> 35:49.731
Hi.

35:50.633 --> 35:53.639
Okay. Let's do this.

36:05.362 --> 36:06.464
Nicole.

36:06.497 --> 36:08.635
What're you doing?

36:14.279 --> 36:16.250
Are you trying
to get us busted?

36:16.283 --> 36:18.187
You gotta admit,
it's pretty hot.

36:18.221 --> 36:22.897
Your wife is right
in the next booth.

36:22.930 --> 36:27.673
If we make too much noise
she'll catch us.

36:27.707 --> 36:29.644
You crazy girl.

36:35.723 --> 36:37.459
Dammit, Lazlo!

36:37.492 --> 36:39.396
This isn't funny!

36:45.843 --> 36:47.914
Come on, come on.

37:12.362 --> 37:13.966
Lazlo?

37:41.086 --> 37:42.723
Lazlo?

37:48.702 --> 37:49.838
Oh, my god!

37:49.871 --> 37:51.641
Oh, my god!!

37:52.877 --> 37:54.681
Uh, lady, people are
starting to show up here.

37:54.714 --> 37:57.352
Ok, I'll be up in a minute.

38:00.826 --> 38:02.462
Damn basement.

38:21.568 --> 38:22.570
Christ.

38:36.598 --> 38:39.938
Stop! Hey!
I'm still here!

39:01.982 --> 39:03.317
Thank you.

39:05.021 --> 39:07.392
Is my husband still
in there?

39:07.827 --> 39:09.463
You'd think with his wife
on the ballot

39:09.496 --> 39:10.566
it wouldn't be such
a tough decision.

39:16.143 --> 39:17.112
Trey?

39:28.100 --> 39:31.407
Christ, Paula, you can't just
open the curtain like that!

39:31.440 --> 39:33.411
It's a violation of
my civil rights.

39:35.883 --> 39:38.589
Mayor, we should probably
get going.

39:38.622 --> 39:39.624
Let's do it.

40:05.776 --> 40:07.379
Come on.

40:13.859 --> 40:15.596
What the hell is that?

40:19.737 --> 40:21.908
Oh, my god,
that's a bone.

40:34.701 --> 40:35.769
Fuck.

41:36.190 --> 41:37.092
Help!

42:35.809 --> 42:38.047
Uh, ma'am?

43:07.773 --> 43:09.342
Woo‐hoo!

43:14.921 --> 43:16.390
Woo!

43:27.112 --> 43:29.116
Oh shit, oh shit!

43:35.896 --> 43:38.033
Uh, hey, yo!
You good?

43:38.067 --> 43:40.071
Is something going
on down there?

43:48.354 --> 43:49.256
No!

43:50.424 --> 43:52.128
No, you don't.

43:58.407 --> 44:03.217
Stop! Stop! No!

44:05.789 --> 44:07.626
What the hell is happening?!

45:16.965 --> 45:18.334
Die!

45:18.367 --> 45:19.336
You piece!

45:19.369 --> 45:20.271
Of!

45:20.304 --> 45:21.306
Shit!

45:40.779 --> 45:42.983
Hey, everyone.

45:43.017 --> 45:46.323
What in the hell did you do
to my Peepaw?

45:50.264 --> 45:54.039
I'm gonna call your boss
and get you fired.

45:54.306 --> 45:56.778
Lauren, you're not gonna
believe this.

45:56.811 --> 45:57.245
The dead‐

45:57.278 --> 45:59.115
Not dead anymore?

46:05.294 --> 46:05.896
It's them.

46:05.929 --> 46:08.367
Ok, everybody, follow me.

46:10.271 --> 46:11.440
Come on! Come on!

46:11.473 --> 46:13.177
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

46:13.210 --> 46:15.147
Get in the basement!

46:23.898 --> 46:25.535
What is going on?

46:25.569 --> 46:26.537
Fucking zombies!

46:26.571 --> 46:27.438
Zombies?

46:27.472 --> 46:30.144
Just calm down, alright?

46:30.177 --> 46:31.213
We're safe down here.

46:31.246 --> 46:33.283
There's bars on the windows,
the door is bolted,

46:33.317 --> 46:35.555
nothing can get in here.

46:46.310 --> 46:48.147
Unless they're already here.
