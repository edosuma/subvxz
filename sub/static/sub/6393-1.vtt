02:12.000 --> 02:16.300
<i>Middlebury College, 1969,</i>
<i>the year of walking on the moon -</i>

02:16.600 --> 02:19.400
<i>- "Yellow Submarine"</i>
<i>and Woodstock.</i>

02:19.800 --> 02:24.300
<i>Also the year that Pope Paul the VI</i>
<i>eliminated 200 saints. Amen.</i>

02:24.700 --> 02:29.500
<i>And I, along wlth my three best</i>
<i>friends, graduated from college.</i>

02:29.900 --> 02:33.900
Where's Cynthia? We've got
to get going. I mean, shouldn't we?

02:34.300 --> 02:37.400
Calm down, Annie.
She said she had a surprise.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.800
How is this?
Is this heaven?

02:40.100 --> 02:45.700
Elise, you are so gorgeous. Really!
Oh, my. It's lovely.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.000
- It's solid.
- Oh, girls.

02:49.300 --> 02:51.700
- Cynthia.
- Here. Open. Put them on.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.700
Oh, my God!

02:55.000 --> 02:58.800
Oh, my God.
You shouldn't have done this.

02:59.300 --> 03:02.500
- It's too much.
- I don't think so. It's just enough.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.700
You'll all write me nice notes,
but now we need a toast.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.100
- Got it.
- Pour, pour! It's picture time.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.100
- Champagne!
- From my folks.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.600
To Annie, Elise and Brenda.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.300
And Cynthia,
I mean our valedictorian.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.700
All right. We're all bound together
forever by friendship and love.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.300
And jewelry!

03:23.600 --> 03:27.400
And we're always going
to be there for each other.

03:27.800 --> 03:32.300
- Oh, God! I'm gonna cry!
- Here! For the rest of our lives.

03:32.700 --> 03:34.700
- One, two, three...
- How's my hair?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.300
It's good.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.400
Mrs. Cynthia?

04:28.700 --> 04:30.000
Teresa...

04:31.900 --> 04:34.100
- I want you to have these.
- No, no, no.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.700
-Yes, yes, yes.
- I cannot take...

04:36.000 --> 04:39.400
- You just think of it as a raise, OK?
- Thank you.

04:39.700 --> 04:42.200
Now, you take the rest of the day off.
Go on.

04:42.500 --> 04:46.900
- Thank you.
- Would you mind mailing these?

05:39.700 --> 05:43.700
<i>Of the four of us, Cynthia was</i>
<i>certainly the most likely to succeed.</i>

05:44.100 --> 05:46.900
<i>When she decided to do something -</i>

05:47.200 --> 05:49.700
<i>- she just went ahead and did it.</i>

05:58.800 --> 06:02.400
Roachie. Come on, honey.
It's Mommy. Mommy's home.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.300
Gosh, think we got any messages?

06:04.700 --> 06:07.900
- What do you think, huh?
- Annie, dear, it's your mother.

06:08.300 --> 06:12.500
<i>It's 6am. Please call me urgently.</i>

06:12.800 --> 06:15.900
Chris!...Honey, I thought you
were going to campus yesterday.

06:16.300 --> 06:20.200
My classes were cancelled.
I slept here. Where were you?!

06:20.600 --> 06:22.400
I was... I was at a friend's.

06:22.600 --> 06:26.700
You were with that man again.
Mother, I am so disappointed.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.100
I'm sorry, but he <i>is</i> your father.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.900
He's using you.
You shouldn't let him.

06:32.200 --> 06:38.000
It's not that simple.
The truth is I love your father.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.000
- I'm sure he loves me.
- You're a doormat!

06:41.300 --> 06:43.700
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so crabby today?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.300
Is it school?.. I know what it is.

06:47.800 --> 06:51.600
- It's a boy.
- I'm a lesbian, mom.

06:51.900 --> 06:54.500
I'm a lesbian.
But that's not the issue here.

06:54.900 --> 06:57.600
- When you say "lesbian"...
- Don't tell Daddy.

06:57.900 --> 07:01.200
I want to tell him myself when the time
is right. Like Father's Day.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.800
- Or Christmas morning.
- Chris...

07:03.100 --> 07:05.400
Thank God, you're all right.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.400
Where were you?
Who saw you?

07:07.700 --> 07:10.300
- Who saw me what?
- She was sleeping with Daddy.

07:11.500 --> 07:16.200
Muffin, you've come
to your senses. I'm so happy.

07:16.700 --> 07:21.600
Mother, I don't sleep with Aaron.
He has problems with his partners.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.200
He's very conflicted, and he
needed somebody to talk to.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.400
- Doormat!
- Lesbian.

07:31.900 --> 07:36.400
Do it, Morris.
Do it to me now. I need it.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.800
You're the only one who does it
the way I like it. You're the king.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.900
Any more collagen, your lips will look
like they were stuck in a pool drain.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.100
I haven't worked in 18 months.

07:48.600 --> 07:52.300
I have a meeting with a director
for a part I would kill for.

07:52.700 --> 07:56.200
- I have to look sexy.
- Elise, you are sexy!

07:56.600 --> 07:59.700
Look at yourself. You're incredible.
You're my masterpiece.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.300
- There's not one line on your face.
- Really? What do you call that?

08:03.700 --> 08:07.300
- And these? What are these?
- You're 45.

08:07.700 --> 08:10.800
One more facelift,
you'll be able to blink your lips.

08:11.100 --> 08:14.000
- Don't you want to play your age?
- My own age?!

08:14.300 --> 08:18.600
You don't understand. There are only
three ages for women in Hollywood:

08:19.000 --> 08:22.400
Babe, district attorney
and "Driving Miss Daisy".

08:22.800 --> 08:27.000
And right now, I want to be young.
Science Fiction "young"!

08:27.400 --> 08:31.900
This is good. Maybe you should
also cut down on the booze.

08:36.700 --> 08:39.000
I know you're upset about the divorce.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.400
- Upset?
- You're upset about Bill's movie.

08:41.799 --> 08:45.900
This isn't about him!
This is about my lips! Look at me.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.600
I want Tina Turner. I want Jagger.

08:50.900 --> 08:52.400
Fill 'em up.

08:54.100 --> 08:59.600
Really? This is fabulous news.
Thank you. Bye... Jason!

09:00.900 --> 09:02.900
Jason! Honey!

09:03.700 --> 09:07.200
Yoo-hoo! "Burning Sensation"
just confirmed.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.200
Jason!

09:09.500 --> 09:11.600
- What?
- "Burning Sensation" confirmed.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.900
- I got the band you wanted.
- Cool!

09:14.900 --> 09:16.200
Affection!

09:18.500 --> 09:20.000
Gimme that!

09:23.700 --> 09:25.700
- What is this?
- Hebrew!

09:26.000 --> 09:29.100
Your Bar Mitzvah's in 3 weeks...
the one thing your father will pay for.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.000
- Learn it!
- Mom!

09:31.300 --> 09:34.600
Don't "but, Mom" me! Learn it.
Don't shame me in the synagogue.

09:37.200 --> 09:40.100
The separation from Aaron is absurd.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.600
How will you fix things
if you're not together?

09:42.900 --> 09:46.600
We're practically together.
We're seeing the same therapist.

09:46.900 --> 09:50.200
- What?
- Her name is Dr. Leslie Rosen.

09:50.600 --> 09:55.300
She's incredible. She helps
Aaron with commitment issues.

09:55.700 --> 09:58.100
We're working on my self-esteem.

09:58.400 --> 10:02.900
You're married with a daughter.
You're happy. Who needs self-esteem!

10:03.300 --> 10:05.800
Mother!

10:06.100 --> 10:08.700
Dr. Rosen says that...

10:10.200 --> 10:11.900
She says you're very controlling.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.300
Me? Controlling?

10:14.600 --> 10:16.400
That is ridiculous.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.900
- Mother, I...
- Roach...

10:19.300 --> 10:21.300
Go!

10:22.800 --> 10:26.000
What if I found somebody else,
mother? It's possible.

10:26.500 --> 10:32.700
You're 46. You're more likely
to be slaughtered by a psycho.

10:33.100 --> 10:36.700
<i>Cynthia Swann Griffin is dead. The</i>
<i>former wife of Wall Street wizard...</i>

10:37.100 --> 10:39.500
Didn't you go to school with her?

10:39.800 --> 10:41.500
<i>...jumped from her</i>
<i>fashionable penthouse apartment.</i>

10:41.900 --> 10:44.500
<i>Mrs. Griffin had recently divorced</i>
<i>her longtime husband -</i>

10:44.800 --> 10:49.000
<i>- Gilbert Griffin. The Wall Street</i>
<i>baron remarried only yesterday.</i>

10:56.900 --> 10:59.900
- Morning, Mohammed.
- Morning, Miss Eliot.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.700
Elise!

11:30.100 --> 11:32.400
- Oh, God. What a tragedy!
- Poor Cynthia.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.500
And your lips!

11:36.500 --> 11:39.800
<i>Elise arrived with</i>
<i>Gunilla Garson-Goldberg.</i>

11:40.200 --> 11:43.700
<i>The queen of New York society.</i>
<i>Nobody gets anywhere -</i>

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
<i>- in this town without</i>
<i>Gunilla's say-so.</i>

11:54.500 --> 11:56.400
Hey, Elise!

12:04.200 --> 12:07.600
She looks wonderful.
Has she had any work done?

12:07.900 --> 12:09.300
Honey, she's a quilt.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.900
<i>Then came Cynthia's</i>
<i>former husband Gilbert Griffin.</i>

12:17.300 --> 12:20.300
<i>A man made rich by</i>
<i>his first wife's connections and now -</i>

12:20.600 --> 12:24.000
<i>- made happy by his</i>
<i>second wife's youthful good looks.</i>

12:26.400 --> 12:29.400
The vampire Lestat. And Louis.

12:40.300 --> 12:44.000
What a nerve!
He should be hanging his head.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.700
You don't know
what he feels right now.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.500
I knew you would be here.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.100
Alice!

13:05.400 --> 13:07.700
- No, Annie.
- Annie!

13:08.300 --> 13:12.200
It's so wonderful to see you.
You're wearing our pearls.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.200
Yeah.

13:14.600 --> 13:17.400
- Hi. It's Brenda. Brenda Morang.
- Brenda!

13:17.700 --> 13:19.700
Annie. Remember me!

13:22.400 --> 13:25.000
- You look wonderful.
- You do too. You look just...

13:25.300 --> 13:27.500
- ...uncanny.
- Thank you.

13:28.900 --> 13:31.500
Dear, sweet, funny, yearning Brenda.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.700
What?

13:40.700 --> 13:43.700
- She's such a bitch.
- I hate that guy.

13:44.100 --> 13:49.300
This might sound horrible after
that but I would really...

13:50.400 --> 13:51.700
- I'd love to...
- Lunch?

13:52.100 --> 13:54.600
No, you're right. It's not right.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.100
Why? We gotta eat. I have a car.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.300
- A limo.
- Yeah.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.600
It is so wonderful seeing you all.

14:06.900 --> 14:08.200
- Elise.
- What?

14:08.500 --> 14:11.800
You have not changed a bit in 20 years.

14:12.100 --> 14:15.400
Not one little bit.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.800
It's utterly bizarre.

14:18.100 --> 14:19.500
- Brenda!
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.300
Ladies, would anyone like a drink?

14:21.600 --> 14:25.100
- Yes, I would like a Virgin Mary.
- Bloody Mary.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.900
- Vodka rocks, please.
- Now, I just want to...

14:28.200 --> 14:32.500
...get this out of the way.
I'm the most terrible person.

14:32.900 --> 14:37.000
I tried to stay in touch.
I should have written every month.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.200
Annie you had a life to lead.

14:40.500 --> 14:44.300
It must have been time-consuming,
churning out those newsletters.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.400
It's a terrible excuse for a reunion -

14:47.700 --> 14:51.500
- but here we all are.
How are you guys, huh?

14:51.800 --> 14:53.900
Just fine. Couldn't be better.

14:54.200 --> 14:57.300
- Things are rolling along for me.
- Same here. Knock wood.

14:57.700 --> 14:59.500
Knock wood.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.400
- It's great to see you guys again.
- Cheers.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.700
Why'd she do it? I don't understand.
Could I have helped her?

15:08.100 --> 15:11.100
What would make her want to?

15:11.600 --> 15:16.600
She gave Gil the best years
of her life. Sacrificed her youth...

15:17.000 --> 15:21.900
Always put herself last to bolster
his ego, his drive, his ambition.

15:22.300 --> 15:28.900
Just as her dignity hung by a thread,
he ran off with a pre-schooler.

15:31.700 --> 15:34.100
- I'm guessing.
- Elise...

15:34.400 --> 15:36.200
You too?

15:37.500 --> 15:38.900
You...Brenda?

15:39.200 --> 15:41.600
- Brenda?
- Morty was a big shot on TV.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
He sold electronics. On our 20th
wedding anniversary, it hits...

15:46.400 --> 15:51.500
...mid-life crisis...Major! He starts
working out, grows a mustache.

15:51.900 --> 15:55.400
He gets an earring. I said:
"Morty, what are you...a pirate?"

15:55.800 --> 15:57.100
"What's next? A parrot?"

15:57.300 --> 16:02.500
Suddenly, I'm a drag. I'm holding
him back because I won't rollerblade.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.900
- What's her name?
- Shelly.

16:06.200 --> 16:10.500
Shelly the barracuda. She's 12.

16:12.800 --> 16:15.600
Bren... Elise.

16:15.900 --> 16:19.100
I am so sorry about
both of your marriages.

16:19.400 --> 16:23.200
I wish I could have helped or
been there in some way.

16:23.600 --> 16:28.000
- What about your marriage?
- Everything's just fine.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.000
Aaron is so terrific...

16:31.400 --> 16:35.300
Now, let's think...we've been
married for 25 years...

16:37.100 --> 16:41.900
Chris is perfect. I mean,
lesbians are great...nowadays!

16:42.300 --> 16:46.300
The marriage is going...
It's going to be really fine.

16:46.700 --> 16:49.600
Aaron and I...we're...

16:49.900 --> 16:54.500
..temporarily sort of...
We're separated!

16:56.500 --> 16:59.100
- Separated.
- Separated?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.700
Separated.

17:16.099 --> 17:18.900
OK, Elise, the time has come...

17:19.200 --> 17:22.000
Spill! Those lips...what's in 'em?

17:22.300 --> 17:25.300
- Are they wax?
- Excuse me?

17:25.700 --> 17:28.099
What else did you have done?
You can tell me.

17:28.400 --> 17:33.000
The cheeks, the jawline...
Have just a little or the full enchilada?

17:33.400 --> 17:36.900
I work out daily, watch my diet.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.200
- I haven't had plastic surgery!
- Good for you!

17:40.600 --> 17:42.300
- You look terrific.
- Come on!

17:42.600 --> 17:45.600
You're lying through your caps!

17:45.900 --> 17:49.100
OK, I have been refreshed a little.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.400
- Oh, God, does it hurt?
- No.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.600
The stuff they take off...
Can you keep it?

17:55.900 --> 17:58.100
Come on, it's the 90s.

17:58.400 --> 18:04.100
Plastic surgery is like good grooming.
It's like brushing your teeth.

18:04.700 --> 18:11.200
Elise, you've been yanked, stitched,
stuffed and pulled. You're a turkey.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.600
- And to please your ex-husband?
- No...

18:14.900 --> 18:19.300
...to please everybody.
To please everybody!

18:19.700 --> 18:25.000
Men, women, studio executives.
Come on, youth and beauty.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.200
Men, that's the ticket!

18:27.600 --> 18:31.500
When men... No, when women
get to be a certain age...

18:32.000 --> 18:36.100
- ...bye, bye love. Hello, poptarts.
- That's right, baby.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.700
It's a holocaust.

18:39.700 --> 18:44.200
God, I wish I had the courage
to give it all up. To say...

18:44.600 --> 18:50.800
...who gives a rat's ass.
Just let myself go like you two did.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.500
No offense.

18:53.900 --> 18:57.200
- None taken.
- Speak for yourself, OK!

18:57.500 --> 19:01.200
Elise, you're gifted,
talented and successful.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.500
Brenda, you're wonderfully verbal.

19:04.800 --> 19:08.300
And I am seeing
a very talented therapist.

19:08.700 --> 19:14.800
We're in our prime! By the way,
my marriage is fine, thank you.

19:15.300 --> 19:20.600
Annie, you have an amazing attitude.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.300
You are...so cheerful.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.800
- You are...
- Look at me.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.100
You are genuinely happy.

19:31.400 --> 19:34.700
- It's a beautiful thing.
- Thank you.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.600
Lithium?

19:43.800 --> 19:49.000
You'd have been proud of me, Leslie.
I was the only positive one there.

19:49.500 --> 19:55.300
There were traces of the wonderful,
witty women I knew before -

19:55.700 --> 20:02.900
- but they're just so angry.They're so
confused. When we were young...

20:03.400 --> 20:05.800
- ...we had such spirit.
- Say it, honey.

20:06.100 --> 20:11.400
- Work from love.
- OK, work from love.

20:11.900 --> 20:15.400
- Grow from love.
- Grow from love.

20:15.700 --> 20:17.100
Screw the world.

20:17.400 --> 20:22.300
- I can't say that. I'm sorry.
- Annie, you are still doing it.

20:22.700 --> 20:24.900
- I know.
- You have a problem with anger.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.500
You're absolutely right.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.900
It's my... I don't know what it is!
It's my mother. It's Connecticut.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.500
- It's all these loud noises.
- And Aaron.

20:32.800 --> 20:36.800
I know we're separated.
But I think this is really a rest period.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.600
We're just getting our...

20:39.800 --> 20:43.700
- Do it, Annie! Get angry.
- I couldn't. I know that I should...

20:44.100 --> 20:45.300
- It's just...
- Hit me.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.200
Stand up and hit me.

20:47.400 --> 20:52.600
I can't. I'm so sorry. Maybe...

20:53.200 --> 20:57.500
Let it out. I want you to hit me.
Trust me. It's OK.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.300
OK.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.700
Rambo!

21:06.000 --> 21:09.700
A real tough guy.
Come on, Annie...

21:10.100 --> 21:13.500
- Hit me!
- I love that.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.600
- My God.
- That was better.

21:19.900 --> 21:24.200
- I'm sorry. Please don't tell Aaron.
- Time's up.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.200
- Time to go. Do you feel better?
- Thank you.

21:30.700 --> 21:34.800
He hasn't the guts to tell me he wants
a divorce. I have to hear it on TV.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.600
- Elise, be cool. Be calm.
- I am!

21:37.900 --> 21:40.800
- I saw that show. It was interesting.
- I don't want to hear it.

21:41.100 --> 21:45.400
My client's and Miss Eliot's marriage
resulted in many successful films -

21:45.900 --> 21:49.000
- including "Inner Urges",
"Human lnstinct" -

21:49.400 --> 21:55.200
- and "Animal Nature" in which she
played a sensuous veterinarian.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.100
- Thank you.
- My idea!

21:57.400 --> 21:59.300
- Was not.
- Was too.

21:59.600 --> 22:02.800
My client produced these films
which enhanced Miss Eliot's career.

22:03.300 --> 22:06.400
- Therefore, she is indebted to him.
- I produced these films!

22:06.800 --> 22:08.700
You knew nothing when I met you.

22:09.100 --> 22:11.900
I taught you everything! What?

22:12.200 --> 22:14.200
Those were your best years, Elise.

22:14.500 --> 22:20.300
Therefore, we request half of Miss
Eliot's assets and a monthly stipend.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.200
He wants alimony?

22:22.400 --> 22:26.400
As for the sculpture, art, Japanese
porcelain and <i>objets d'art-</i>

22:26.800 --> 22:30.100
- collected during the marriage,
my client thinks it fair for Miss Eliot -

22:30.600 --> 22:34.000
- to dispose of the items
and divide the proceeds evenly.

22:34.300 --> 22:35.900
They were anniversary presents -

22:36.200 --> 22:38.300
- Xmas presents. I gave him
everything. Now he wants more?!

22:42.900 --> 22:49.000
Now, Duarto, I ask you: who's this
for? An anorexic teen? A fetus?

22:49.600 --> 22:53.200
It's a conspiracy. I know it is. I've
had enough. I'm leading a protest.

22:53.500 --> 22:58.100
I'm not buying any more clothes until
designers come to their senses.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.600
<i>Brenda worked for a</i>
<i>man named Duarto Feliz -</i>

23:02.000 --> 23:05.700
<i>- one of the ten worst</i>
<i>interior decorators in New York.</i>

23:06.000 --> 23:09.200
<i>I think his real name</i>
<i>was Duane Hemelwitz.</i>

23:09.600 --> 23:12.700
- It's electric. Look at this hideous...
- I can't afford it.

23:13.100 --> 23:17.300
You've got to have it. Try it on.
You could sell a broach, your son...

23:17.700 --> 23:19.500
Duarto...

23:20.200 --> 23:25.100
- Morty! Look at you.
- Brenda, don't embarrass me.

23:25.500 --> 23:28.300
Don't embarrass me.
Don't make a scene.

23:28.800 --> 23:32.000
You've got nerve.
Know what's embarrassing?

23:32.300 --> 23:36.000
Being hassled by Mr. Zaworsky
because I'm behind in the rent.

23:36.500 --> 23:40.600
That's embarrassing. Worrying about
how to pay for my kid's college.

23:41.100 --> 23:44.600
You know what? You never listened.
20 years and you never listened.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.200
Here! Try this on in the fitting
room. It looks very nice.

23:48.600 --> 23:51.300
I could use this. It's very
beautiful. I love the color...

23:51.700 --> 23:54.000
But what can I use for money?
How am I gonna pay for it?

23:54.300 --> 23:59.200
The company is expanding. Not me!
I'm a mere laborer.

23:59.600 --> 24:03.300
- You're a liar and a fraud.
- I have no money. I'm not rich.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.400
- Why don't you look in your purse?
- Very funny.

24:05.700 --> 24:08.900
- They're stunning, Morton. I want 'em.
- Morton?

24:10.300 --> 24:13.600
- Oh, God, make it go away.
- Shelly, look at you.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.900
- The bulimia has paid off.
- Don't start.

24:18.300 --> 24:21.500
What's the matter, Morty?
Can't you buy her a whole dress?

24:21.800 --> 24:25.200
Why don't you try these on
in your size?

24:29.500 --> 24:33.200
- It was a delight running into you.
<i>- You've read the script.</i>

24:35.400 --> 24:39.800
Yes, it is so original. It's so good.

24:40.300 --> 24:43.100
You're so gifted, Brett.

24:45.700 --> 24:48.700
And Monique... "Monique"...

24:51.100 --> 24:53.600
She is a great character.

24:54.300 --> 24:57.500
Thank you. Man, what a kick!

24:58.900 --> 25:01.300
Elise Eliot in a Brett Artounian film.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.100
So, tell me how do you see her?

25:06.500 --> 25:09.500
Well, uh, I think we go for...

25:09.800 --> 25:12.600
- ...grotesque.
- What?

25:13.000 --> 25:17.400
All the way. No make-up, overhead
lighting. Bring out every wrinkle...

25:17.800 --> 25:20.500
Every crag.
With you in the part -

25:21.000 --> 25:24.500
- Monique's mother won't be another
Jurassic fleshbag in a wheelchair.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.800
She's epic.

25:28.300 --> 25:32.200
Elise Eliot,
the crypt-keeper. Wow!

25:59.200 --> 26:02.100
Mom, I'm spending the night
at Dad's. Don't worry, I'm studying.

26:02.500 --> 26:05.200
<i>Baruch atta adonoy...</i>
Happy now?

26:17.100 --> 26:18.500
Maurice?

26:20.600 --> 26:24.500
I want another one.
They want me to play the mother.

26:25.700 --> 26:28.400
- Sorry.
- The mother!

26:28.800 --> 26:30.400
Let me ask you something.

26:31.800 --> 26:34.800
- Is this the face of a mother?
- No, ma'am.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.400
Certainly not mine.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.200
So I thought.

26:45.100 --> 26:48.100
Not to be critical,
but you've no feeling for noodles.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.300
Thank you, Mom.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.500
Hello.

26:56.800 --> 27:02.400
Aaron... Nothing...
Just having pasta with mother.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.700
No, you say... Sure!

27:04.900 --> 27:07.500
That would be good. Bye.

27:08.800 --> 27:13.100
We're going to have dinner!
Can you believe that? Oh my God!

27:13.600 --> 27:17.100
Do you know what this means?
It means he's re-prioritized.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.700
He's worked through his
relationship phobias -

27:20.000 --> 27:24.100
- his fear of intimacy, his thing about
my poisoning his food.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.100
He's ready to recommit.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.300
Excuse me, so sorry.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.500
<i>Una?</i>
By yourself?

27:47.900 --> 27:49.100
<i>Si.</i>

28:22.600 --> 28:25.500
- How are you?
- Hello. Allow me.

28:52.400 --> 28:58.700
I'm not Monique's mother. Angela
Lansbury's Monique's mother.

28:59.100 --> 29:02.500
- Shelley Winters is Unique's mother.
- Now, that's good.

29:02.900 --> 29:08.400
- Sean Connery's Unique's mother.
- Perhaps some coffee now.

29:08.900 --> 29:14.600
I take that back. Sean Connery
is Monique's boyfriend.

29:15.100 --> 29:19.300
He's 300 years old,
but he's still a stud.

29:24.600 --> 29:29.700
- I'm not happy, Maurice.
- I'm going to get you that coffee.

29:39.900 --> 29:44.300
- Honey... I think I should go.
- I know.

29:44.700 --> 29:51.500
Tomorrow, we could start moving
your things back in...if that's okay?

29:52.000 --> 29:56.200
I hated seeing your side
of the closet all empty.

29:57.900 --> 30:03.700
Dr. Rosen...she would be proud of us.
I wish she were here.

30:04.200 --> 30:10.200
Not literally. I can't wait to tell her
how we worked it all out.

30:10.700 --> 30:14.300
We should get therapy gold stars.

30:14.600 --> 30:15.800
Annie...

30:18.200 --> 30:19.900
I love you.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.200
Come here.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.000
Yes.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.600
I love you.

30:44.700 --> 30:46.800
I want a divorce.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.100
- Stay calm.
- But we just made love!

30:54.400 --> 30:57.000
You asked me out.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.900
I asked you out to tell you,
but you looked so great.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.700
I thought: "How romantic.
One last time."

31:03.000 --> 31:07.100
- A goodbye kiss.
- But this wasn't just a kiss.

31:07.500 --> 31:10.400
Don't be childish.
You know how you manipulate me.

31:10.700 --> 31:13.200
- What?! Manipulate?
- Don't.

31:13.500 --> 31:16.000
What?.. Oh my God.

31:16.800 --> 31:20.300
- Is there someone else?
- No. This is about us.

31:20.700 --> 31:22.000
It's really not you.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.200
Babe?

31:25.400 --> 31:26.700
Oh my God!

31:27.000 --> 31:29.600
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God.

31:29.900 --> 31:32.500
- This is very awkward.
- No, Annie was just leaving.

31:32.800 --> 31:35.100
- You told her?
- I was totally upfront.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.400
What? Excuse me!

31:37.700 --> 31:39.900
Annie, this is rough.
I know that.

31:40.200 --> 31:43.300
Rough?! Wait a minute.
I don't understand. You're my therapist?

31:43.700 --> 31:47.200
- I'm a woman.
- He is my husband.

31:47.500 --> 31:52.000
We've been separated for months.
Let's not overdramatize, OK?

31:52.400 --> 31:55.600
She's allowed to be angry.
- Annie, let's use this.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.600
He's found someone new.
You're free! Closure!

31:58.900 --> 32:03.000
I'm sorry,
but that isn't what this is.

32:03.400 --> 32:06.400
You're not helping us out here.

32:06.700 --> 32:09.200
- Now, I'm sorry.
- So am I!

32:09.500 --> 32:15.900
Very sorry I ever met you!
Sorry I loved you for all those years!

32:16.400 --> 32:19.700
I'm sorry I was there
for you every minute -

32:20.100 --> 32:23.900
- of every day and supported
you in your every move.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.500
I'm sorry!

33:20.300 --> 33:21.700
Oh, my God.

33:38.700 --> 33:42.700
"I wish I had talent like Elise"-

33:43.200 --> 33:45.300
- "Brenda's humor" -

33:47.500 --> 33:50.100
- "or your strength, Annie."

33:51.100 --> 33:55.000
"Most of all I wish
I still had our friendship."

33:55.400 --> 33:59.900
"Perhaps Gil isn't the problem."
Oh, God...

34:00.300 --> 34:03.200
"Perhaps loneliness is."

34:06.900 --> 34:10.199
"Please take care of each other.
Love, Cynthia."

34:14.400 --> 34:20.000
- And on such pretty stationery.
- I have to make some calls, Mom.

34:25.699 --> 34:30.199
- God, poor Cynthia.
- If only she had called me.

34:30.600 --> 34:31.800
If only I were listed.

34:32.100 --> 34:35.300
You know what? She was right.
In college we were focused.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.600
We were brave.
We couldn't wait.

34:37.900 --> 34:41.300
It's all over. I'm alone.
I don't have anything.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.300
I don't have anything!

34:43.600 --> 34:49.199
You have a son who adores you.
I'm alone! I'm Monique's mother.

34:49.699 --> 34:53.100
But Jason's off to college pretty
soon. I'll be even more alone.

34:53.500 --> 34:55.400
Plus I'll be a lot older.

34:55.699 --> 34:58.500
Any more plastic surgery,
I won't be able to sleep.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.200
I'll have to work at McDonalds!

35:00.600 --> 35:04.100
-I'll have to do ads for adult diapers.
- I'll have to wear them.

35:04.900 --> 35:06.200
I just spent 25 years -

35:06.500 --> 35:11.800
- with a self-absorbed man
who is marrying my therapist...

35:12.200 --> 35:15.800
- ...who lectured me on self-esteem.
- You win!

35:16.200 --> 35:19.200
I won't be that woman anymore.
It's unacceptable.

35:19.500 --> 35:23.200
It is unacceptable! I made
all those stupid movies with Bill.

35:23.600 --> 35:26.000
I gave him a career
and he stole mine.

35:26.300 --> 35:29.700
I worked behind the cash register
at his first store...in his first 15 stores!

35:30.100 --> 35:32.800
I gave Aaron a home
and a daughter.

35:33.100 --> 35:36.300
- I washed and ironed his shorts.
- You did?

35:36.600 --> 35:38.700
Well, I supervised.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.100
What do we want? Revenge?

35:42.500 --> 35:45.900
No! We are not talking about revenge.
I am talking about justice.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.600
I'm going to give Aaron so much
justice he won't see straight...

35:49.000 --> 35:51.700
- ...if he thinks partners are trouble.
- Bill's always had it easy.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.200
That's right. Bill's had it easy
every inch of the way.

35:55.600 --> 35:57.200
He's always had a woman
look after him.

35:57.500 --> 35:59.600
What would happen one day
if he didn't?

35:59.900 --> 36:02.400
What do you think, Brenda?

36:02.700 --> 36:05.600
I love Morty. Very deeply.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.600
- I wouldn't want to see him harmed.
- You don't?

36:10.000 --> 36:13.400
I want him dumped!
By Little Miss Midriff.

36:13.800 --> 36:16.100
By that Stairmastered
L'Orealed crotch jockey.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.700
In front of
the whole Western Hemisphere.

36:17.900 --> 36:24.400
On the 6 o'clock news. Okay!
After that I want world peace.

36:24.900 --> 36:28.300
Let's get serious. We helped them rise.
We can help them fall.

36:28.700 --> 36:30.900
How are we going to do that.

36:31.200 --> 36:34.400
We're has-beens, hanging on
by a thread. We're discards.

36:34.800 --> 36:39.300
We're not hanging on by a thread.
Look, by being together - us - unity.

36:39.800 --> 36:42.300
If all the first wives of the world
got together...

36:42.700 --> 36:45.400
- ...what else do we need?
- Just one amazing attorney.

36:45.700 --> 36:48.800
All we need is us.
Three women who aren't afraid to fight.

36:49.100 --> 36:55.100
Stand up for dignity and self-esteem!
Then we'll let 'em have it.

36:57.300 --> 36:58.600
- See this?
- What?

36:58.800 --> 37:00.600
- Wait, right here, OK?
- OK.

37:00.900 --> 37:03.500
See this? Put it in there.

37:07.200 --> 37:10.400
All right. First Wives Club,
come to order.

37:10.700 --> 37:12.400
<i>Starting the club was easy.</i>

37:12.800 --> 37:15.700
<i>Figuring out what to do next</i>
<i>was much harder.</i>

37:16.000 --> 37:19.300
<i>We each decided to gather</i>
<i>information about our husbands.</i>

37:19.700 --> 37:22.900
- Elise, Elise...
- Yeah...

37:23.200 --> 37:24.100
<i>I went in search of a spy.</i>

37:26.100 --> 37:29.500
Why can't we call Chris
and ask her to help us?

37:29.900 --> 37:33.600
I want her to know I support
her lifestyle completely.

37:34.100 --> 37:37.600
- I've never been to a gay bar!
- Here we go.

37:37.900 --> 37:40.700
Hi, I think you're just terrific.

37:48.400 --> 37:53.100
Look at this. My God!
Isn't this great? All these women.

37:53.500 --> 37:54.900
Yeah, maybe we'll get lucky.

37:55.100 --> 37:58.900
Elise Eliot, right?
You're from the movies.

37:59.300 --> 38:01.300
- Yeah...
- I knew you were gay!

38:01.600 --> 38:05.900
I said Elise Eliot is so hot!
You're like the most -

38:06.400 --> 38:08.400
- amazing babe on this planet.

38:08.700 --> 38:11.700
God bless you!

38:12.000 --> 38:15.700
- You wanna dance?
- Uh, yeah.

38:18.100 --> 38:19.400
Hi, Sweetie.

38:19.700 --> 38:23.200
Mom! Hi...

38:23.600 --> 38:25.700
We wanted to have a little...

38:26.000 --> 38:27.400
What's the matter?

38:27.700 --> 38:30.700
I thought we could have a little chat
about our plans.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.300
Mom...

38:32.700 --> 38:35.600
- You know you're in a gay bar.
- That's what's so great.

38:35.900 --> 38:39.800
It's very women-identified and...
by the way...

38:40.200 --> 38:42.800
I'm Chris' Mom.

38:43.100 --> 38:45.000
Are you gay?

38:45.400 --> 38:46.800
Sorry!

38:53.100 --> 38:54.800
What's wrong?

38:55.600 --> 39:01.100
My lover left mer after 18 years
for some teenager who weighs 12 lb.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.000
What am I going to do?

39:03.200 --> 39:07.100
- God! That's just like me and Morty.
- Who?

39:07.500 --> 39:09.600
Morty.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.700
She's butch.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.500
Nail Daddy and those
other low-lifes?

39:16.800 --> 39:20.800
I don't mean "nail 'em".
I mean, just teach and help them.

39:21.300 --> 39:23.800
- Vaporize them!
- Yeah, sure.

39:24.100 --> 39:26.300
Yes! Yes! Yes!

39:26.600 --> 39:29.200
I'm in. I'm really in.

39:38.800 --> 39:41.000
Elise...

39:41.300 --> 39:44.200
Elise, Chris is in!

39:44.500 --> 39:47.300
Can you believe it? Mission
accomplished. We'd better go.

39:47.800 --> 39:49.000
She's staying!

39:49.200 --> 39:52.200
She's with me, babe!
Come on, honey, my place.

39:55.300 --> 39:57.700
Brenda, you're so possessive!

39:59.200 --> 40:02.400
Something I was just
thinking about...my resume.

40:02.800 --> 40:08.800
Wouldn't interfere with school.
Something part-time until I graduate.

40:09.200 --> 40:12.100
Come on, Dad.
How about a little nepotism?

40:12.500 --> 40:13.800
I'll hire you.

40:14.000 --> 40:19.700
I'm surprised. You've never
shown interest in advertising.

40:20.300 --> 40:23.100
I know, Daddy.
I'm here to learn.

40:24.700 --> 40:26.400
That's great.

40:31.600 --> 40:35.800
<i>Elise decided to pull the rug</i>
<i>out from under Bill...literally.</i>

40:36.100 --> 40:39.600
<i>After all, his lawyer told her</i>
<i>to dispose of their common property.</i>

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Miss Eliot, you know
he hates interruptions.

40:42.300 --> 40:45.400
Please let me
tell him you're here. Please...

40:48.500 --> 40:50.700
Elise...what a kick!
But I'm on with the Coast.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.200
All the good stuff goes.
The Lampico, the Ming vase.

40:54.500 --> 40:59.700
Amari horsemen, Fabergé eggs, the
Wingback chair, the green Tiffany lamp.

41:00.100 --> 41:02.100
Babe...what's going on?

41:02.400 --> 41:06.600
As requested, I'm consolidating
the matrimonial assets for liquidation.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.300
That includes these antiques
I bought for you.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.600
- You are the best.
- Love tokens, anniversary gifts.

41:13.900 --> 41:18.200
- Junk. Here, take that desk too.
- Elise, this hurts me.

41:18.600 --> 41:21.300
I care about you...about us.
About the magic.

41:21.600 --> 41:24.500
- What exactly is going on here?
- And this Japanese secretary.

41:24.800 --> 41:27.000
- I want that to go.
- Back off, Jacko!

41:27.500 --> 41:30.400
Elise, this isn't right. It's hormonal.
You can't do this.

41:30.700 --> 41:33.300
- Watch me!
- But this is my stuff!

41:33.700 --> 41:36.800
It's the 90s, Bill. Downsize!

41:42.900 --> 41:44.900
<i>At Jason's Bar Mitzvah</i>
<i>2 weeks later-</i>

41:45.200 --> 41:48.300
<i>- First Wives Club</i>
<i>got its first big break.</i>

41:48.700 --> 41:53.000
<i>Thanks to Brenda's dear,</i>
<i>dear Sicilian uncle.</i>

41:56.100 --> 41:59.300
Uncle Carmine. My father's side.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.400
Morty and I have planned for this day
since Jason was born.

42:05.700 --> 42:09.500
- But Morty's going to be here.
- But next to me.

42:09.900 --> 42:12.100
We're not a family anymore.

42:12.400 --> 42:15.100
It's OK. I'll be fine.

42:17.900 --> 42:19.600
Excuse me.

42:26.900 --> 42:28.400
He brought her...

42:29.300 --> 42:31.900
...to my son's Bar Mitzvah!

42:32.200 --> 42:33.400
Is she a gift?

42:37.200 --> 42:41.200
- Brenda, can I speak freely?
- Sure. Annie's cool.

42:41.600 --> 42:45.900
I speak for the entire family and your
late father - my beloved brother -

42:46.300 --> 42:53.100
- when I say Morty is garbage.
I'd be honored to take him out.

42:54.100 --> 42:59.300
No, don't you dare. Morty the
Garbage is my problem.

42:59.800 --> 43:03.100
I'll work it out myself.
Thanks for the thought anyway.

43:03.500 --> 43:04.800
My angel.

43:05.100 --> 43:08.500
For Morty to treat you this way after
what your father did for him...

43:08.800 --> 43:11.100
Where would he be?

43:11.500 --> 43:16.000
The first year of his business,
all his merchandise -

43:16.500 --> 43:20.200
- fell off one of our trucks.

43:20.600 --> 43:22.100
You're not serious?

43:22.400 --> 43:25.600
We were happy
to help you newlyweds.

43:25.900 --> 43:28.800
My Morty a crook?

43:29.300 --> 43:33.200
Check his books.
They're fiction. Bestsellers!

43:33.900 --> 43:37.100
<i>- Ciao.</i>
<i>- Ciao. Grazie.</i>

43:39.900 --> 43:41.900
Really liked your uncle.

43:45.900 --> 43:50.100
- Mother! Mother! Where are you?
- Over here, bitch.

43:50.500 --> 43:54.300
Mother, I met a man. He's an angel.

43:54.700 --> 43:57.400
He's a God. He's a doctor.

43:58.300 --> 43:59.700
It's perfect.

44:02.800 --> 44:06.600
- Do I really have the part?
- Baby, you know it.

44:08.100 --> 44:09.700
Pizza!

44:12.200 --> 44:14.900
- Oh my God!
- Elise!

44:15.200 --> 44:18.000
- There's the Lichtenstein.
- What the hell are you doing?

44:18.400 --> 44:20.700
- The Dine. Take that.
- This is so cool.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
- All the gym equipment.
- I'm getting a restraining order.

44:23.300 --> 44:27.200
No, Bill, this is great.
- Hi, I'm Phoebe.

44:27.500 --> 44:31.000
I've seen all your movies
and I want to be just like you, only me!

44:31.400 --> 44:35.600
Phoebe, some advice...
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.400
- Pheebs, she's bitter.
- And take the cappuccino machine!

44:39.700 --> 44:41.600
Bill, I have a great idea.

44:41.900 --> 44:44.700
Wouldn't she be great
to play opposite me?

44:45.200 --> 44:46.900
Bill is producing this new,
incredible movie -

44:47.100 --> 44:49.700
- with this young, hot director.
I'm the star of it.

44:50.100 --> 44:52.800
- I'm Monique.
- What?

44:53.100 --> 44:55.200
And you can be my Mom!

45:00.300 --> 45:04.600
<i>While Elise cleaned out Bill's office,</i>
<i>loft and house in the Hamptons -</i>

45:05.000 --> 45:08.700
<i>Brenda and I looked for an office.</i>
<i>A base for the Club.</i>

45:13.400 --> 45:15.300
Come in.

45:18.200 --> 45:22.100
Look at this.
It's early everything, huh.

45:22.500 --> 45:26.100
Oh, my goodness.
Look at this.

45:28.100 --> 45:30.500
You know what it says?
"I beat Meryl."

45:30.800 --> 45:34.300
- It does not. Put that down.
- Is there chocolate inside?

45:34.700 --> 45:36.600
- Put it down!
- OK, OK.

45:36.900 --> 45:42.400
Put it gently down.
Look. Do you believe this stuff?

45:42.900 --> 45:45.300
I don't know where to put it.
There's no room in my warehouse.

45:45.700 --> 45:48.800
I could have put it in my
building downtown.

45:49.100 --> 45:50.800
- You own a building?
- Yeah, I do.

45:51.100 --> 45:53.000
I sublet it normally, but...

45:53.300 --> 45:55.700
...now it's...vacant.

46:07.100 --> 46:10.500
There's a lot of work to be done.
You have to see it.

46:10.900 --> 46:13.000
Look at this.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.800
All right, this is perfect.

46:21.100 --> 46:25.900
All right, girls!
This is fabulous.

46:28.800 --> 46:33.900
<i>While Brenda and I worked like crazy</i>
<i>gathering information -</i>

46:34.400 --> 46:37.200
<i>- Elise spent most of her time</i>
<i>on the phone to her agent.</i>

46:38.000 --> 46:41.600
Dan Carlin, please.
Elise Eliot calling.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.700
- Elise Eliot!
<i>- And finally it came through for her.</i>

46:46.700 --> 46:52.000
- This is a great play!
- I told her she had to do it.

46:52.400 --> 46:55.600
I don't want to do theater!
I haven't done theater in years!

46:55.900 --> 46:59.700
Bill always said theater
was bad for my career...

47:00.100 --> 47:03.100
- ...which actually I agree with.
- Excuse me, but this is a great role.

47:03.400 --> 47:07.000
This is about a bitter, unloved,
emotionally barren woman.

47:07.400 --> 47:09.700
- That's not me!
- It's you!

47:10.500 --> 47:11.900
Thank you.

47:15.500 --> 47:18.100
- Hello.
<i>- It's Bill. Where's Elise?</i>

47:18.500 --> 47:21.100
- It's for you... Bill.
- Hello.

47:21.400 --> 47:24.400
<i>- Listen to me, you piece of garbage.</i>
- I can't hear you.

47:24.700 --> 47:27.600
I'll sue you. I'll break you.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.500
You vindictive sack of silicone!

47:30.800 --> 47:35.200
<i>- That's my car, you piece of plastic!</i>
- Oh, darn.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.800
Bill... Lamborghini.

47:38.100 --> 47:39.700
The Lamborghini.

47:39.900 --> 47:41.200
He's mad. Whoo!

47:44.400 --> 47:46.500
Elise, can I ask you a question?

47:46.800 --> 47:50.400
Aren't you frustrated? You climb
and climb and go nowhere.

47:50.800 --> 47:55.600
I love it! Burns off the booze.
You want to know something?

47:56.000 --> 48:00.100
- I get my best ideas when I work out.
- You get ideas?!

48:00.500 --> 48:03.500
It clears out my head. I think straight.
Everything makes sense.

48:03.800 --> 48:06.800
Better start thinking because
we need Morty's books to prove fraud.

48:07.300 --> 48:10.900
I know where they are!
Morty just bought Shelly a penthouse.

48:11.200 --> 48:14.500
- Now, figure out how to get in.
- Duarto.

48:14.900 --> 48:17.900
Shelly has a new apartment
that needs to be decorated.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.900
Gunilla, I'd adore it.

48:24.800 --> 48:28.300
<i>Enchantée. Au revoir, jolie!</i>

48:28.600 --> 48:34.900
Gunilla Garson-Goldberg personally
invited me to her society luncheon.

48:35.400 --> 48:37.100
Why?

48:39.100 --> 48:44.400
<i>Gunilla Goldberg was happy helping</i>
<i>us, she being a first wife herself.</i>

48:44.800 --> 48:48.700
<i>Indeed, Gunilla was a 1st, 2nd, 3rd -</i>

48:49.100 --> 48:53.500
<i>- and 4th wife, which accounted for</i>
<i>her very comfortable surroundings.</i>

48:54.000 --> 48:56.800
This is delicious!
Usually I bring my own dressing.

48:57.100 --> 49:01.000
That fat-free ranch stuff,
but this is restaurant quality.

49:01.400 --> 49:04.100
- Thank you.
- Can I tell you something?

49:04.400 --> 49:06.500
When I first got your call,
I said to Morty...

49:06.800 --> 49:11.300
"This just feels so right."
Me and Gunilla.

49:11.700 --> 49:15.900
I used to work for Morty
as his executive assistant.

49:16.300 --> 49:18.900
He was married to that
nightmare then...Brenda -

49:19.200 --> 49:21.800
- a completely class-free
dumpster woman.

49:22.100 --> 49:25.400
I said to him: "Morty, you' ve got to
move on and move up."

49:25.800 --> 49:29.900
Now, here I am! Taste Central.

49:30.300 --> 49:36.800
The moment I saw you...my first
impression was she's someone...

49:37.400 --> 49:41.100
See, that's what I told him.
But he doesn't get it.

49:41.400 --> 49:44.700
- He doesn't get a lot of things.
- Are you finished?

49:45.100 --> 49:48.000
- Yeah, I'm done.
- Take the fork.

49:50.500 --> 49:52.200
Fork!

49:54.300 --> 50:01.300
All you need to enter society
is some advice and a guiding hand.

50:01.800 --> 50:03.500
Like what?

50:03.900 --> 50:07.800
The correct florist
and the utterly ideal chef.

50:08.100 --> 50:11.400
Of course, a decorator...of death.

50:13.300 --> 50:16.600
Your house is your calling card.
It has to be perfected -

50:17.000 --> 50:19.500
- photographed, published.

50:19.800 --> 50:22.300
Can you really help me?
I would kill for that.

50:22.600 --> 50:29.000
That's unnecessary.
Just two words: Duarto Feliz.

50:29.500 --> 50:32.900
He is a genius. A gem!

50:34.500 --> 50:38.100
Of course, he's impossible to get.
He works all the time.

50:43.900 --> 50:45.200
Oh, my God!

50:46.900 --> 50:48.600
There she is! Princess Pelvis.

50:48.900 --> 50:51.200
- Gunilla says she went for it.
- Fabulous!

50:51.500 --> 50:53.300
Johnny, let's go.

50:53.600 --> 50:56.400
So, Duarto makes his move
and Shelly falls for it.

50:56.700 --> 50:59.600
- Let's synchronize our watches.
- Just like "Mission Impossible".

51:01.700 --> 51:04.800
- These people are always late.
- Shut up, Morty, and stay shut up.

51:05.200 --> 51:08.500
- Take it easy.
- What if he doesn't like us?

51:08.800 --> 51:12.200
- What are you worried about?
Go on, answer the bell.

51:17.600 --> 51:19.500
- Okay!
- Fine.

51:27.000 --> 51:31.000
Hello!
Please, do come in.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.600
It's an honor and beyond.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
Gunilla Garson-Goldberg informs me
you are my new best friend.

51:38.300 --> 51:41.700
- I hope!
- Duarto Feliz...And may I?

51:42.100 --> 51:43.600
Please!

51:45.100 --> 51:46.900
Extraordinary!

51:49.100 --> 51:52.300
Interesting little touches everywhere.

51:53.600 --> 51:58.500
- What?
- That chair is agony.

51:58.900 --> 52:00.800
- Morty, do something!
- What?

52:01.100 --> 52:05.400
- Just cover it up. Get rid of it!
-Take it easy.

52:05.900 --> 52:08.000
It's his chair.
I didn't want that chair.

52:08.300 --> 52:10.700
- It's covered.
- Thanks ever so much.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.500
Now, then...

52:14.900 --> 52:16.500
I feel...

52:16.800 --> 52:18.100
You feel...

52:18.400 --> 52:20.400
Light...

52:30.700 --> 52:32.400
- Get out.
- What?!

52:32.700 --> 52:36.000
I need to be alone
in this space for an hour, at least.

52:36.300 --> 52:38.600
It is very delicate.
I must bond.

52:38.900 --> 52:41.900
- We understand.
- I must have total access.

52:42.300 --> 52:45.200
- What is upstairs?
- That's just the office.

52:45.500 --> 52:46.800
<i>Le office.</i>

52:47.200 --> 52:49.400
Stay out of
<i>le office!</i>

52:49.700 --> 52:52.600
- Leave me one hour.
- We understand.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
One hour!
Thank you.

53:01.300 --> 53:02.900
Bye bye.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.200
Girls... Girls!
Come on, hurry.

53:08.500 --> 53:13.300
- Ow, my knee, damn it.
- We don't have much time.

53:13.900 --> 53:18.500
- Where are we going?
- Honey, don't worry about it.

53:18.900 --> 53:20.800
Let's go in here.

53:21.700 --> 53:23.300
Here we go!
In here.

53:35.200 --> 53:36.500
Brenda!

53:38.500 --> 53:40.300
There's an office upstairs.

53:40.500 --> 53:42.200
There's an office upstairs!

53:42.600 --> 53:44.400
- Let's go upstairs.
- Good girl!

53:48.100 --> 53:50.000
I feel dizzy.

53:54.800 --> 53:56.800
Annie, check the computer.
I'll check the files.

53:57.100 --> 53:59.400
I need the key.
Where's the key?

54:05.700 --> 54:07.000
- Hello!
<i>- Ready.</i>

54:11.500 --> 54:13.000
Come on, tax returns.

54:31.400 --> 54:32.600
What is this stuff?

54:42.600 --> 54:43.800
Got 'em!

54:46.300 --> 54:48.300
Come on, hustle, Morty.

54:48.700 --> 54:50.400
Social climbers on the rise.

54:50.700 --> 54:52.900
Oh, God!

54:53.200 --> 54:56.200
- They're back! They're back!
- Stall them.

54:56.700 --> 54:59.400
- With what?
- Make something up. lmprovise.

54:59.700 --> 55:01.100
- What's the matter with you?
- I can't improvise.

55:01.400 --> 55:03.400
I'm putting
the files right in here.

55:03.700 --> 55:07.200
Keep them away from the front door.

55:07.500 --> 55:11.100
- I'm clean. I'm clean. I'm clean.
- Slap her. Slap her.

55:17.900 --> 55:19.200
Hello!

55:19.500 --> 55:23.300
I know you said an hour, but it's cold
today and I couldn't stay away.

55:23.700 --> 55:24.900
- Tell me everything!
- How much?

55:25.200 --> 55:28.900
I'll tell you what. We're going to
look out the living room windows.

55:29.400 --> 55:32.600
Why? Because I'll tell you why.

55:33.000 --> 55:37.400
Windows are the eyes of a room.

55:37.800 --> 55:40.000
-So?
- Oh, Duarto.

55:40.300 --> 55:44.400
The valance...
The valance is our eyebrows.

55:44.900 --> 55:46.700
- The drapes are...
- I gotta pee.

55:46.900 --> 55:48.900
You can't, you can't!

55:50.300 --> 55:54.800
Where was l?
Oh, the drapes...are the eyelashes.

55:55.200 --> 55:58.600
You said windows were eyelashes.

56:01.500 --> 56:05.800
What do we do?
Where do we go?

56:06.200 --> 56:08.500
The window. Come on.

56:14.900 --> 56:17.300
What do we do now?

56:21.800 --> 56:25.500
We'll get into this window
washing thing and ride it down.

56:30.700 --> 56:34.100
- Annie...
- You gotta go down, honey.

56:34.500 --> 56:38.200
- It's the only way out!
- I have a fear of everything.

56:39.200 --> 56:43.000
- Come on, you're the new Annie.
- Annie, watch!

56:43.400 --> 56:47.400
I'm going in first.
I do all my own stunts.

56:55.100 --> 56:57.400
Gimme the controls!

56:59.100 --> 57:02.900
I can't do this!
I can't stand this!

57:03.300 --> 57:05.200
Gotham's my inspiration.

57:05.500 --> 57:09.800
The white of the snow
pelting the trees of Central Park.

57:10.200 --> 57:13.800
The yellow of the taxis.
The blue...

57:14.100 --> 57:19.300
But who cares about blue?
No one feels blue with my design.

57:19.700 --> 57:22.800
- Forget about that.
- What about those drapes?

57:23.200 --> 57:25.800
The window meeting is over.
It's time to consider the stairs.

57:26.100 --> 57:28.400
- What about that dumb fountain?
- I rather like it.

57:28.700 --> 57:30.800
I'd rather look at the window.

57:34.800 --> 57:36.000
Oh, my God!

57:37.600 --> 57:42.700
-Is that Elise Eliot?
- Elise, you look great!

57:43.100 --> 57:45.900
You look great! !

58:14.300 --> 58:15.600
You want to go again?

58:17.700 --> 58:21.900
- Oh, my God!
- I've never been so petrified.

58:22.300 --> 58:26.200
No, really, really...except for
that one time.

58:26.600 --> 58:30.500
- I'm not going to tell you.
- Why not? We won't judge you.

58:30.900 --> 58:33.500
We're your buddies. We cherish you.

58:33.800 --> 58:36.700
We would never ever make fun of you.
Ever! Would we, hon?

58:37.000 --> 58:38.800
- No, no.
- OK.

58:39.100 --> 58:44.400
All right. You remember
Cynthia's 21st birthday?

58:44.800 --> 58:48.300
Her parents rented that big hall.

58:48.800 --> 58:51.200
We wanted to do
something special for her.

58:51.500 --> 58:54.300
Elise thought we should be
the entertainment.

58:54.600 --> 58:57.500
We were supposed
to sing to her like a girl group.

58:57.900 --> 59:01.500
We sang that Leslie Gore song.
Remember? We were a big hit.

59:01.800 --> 59:05.100
I hated it. I can't sing.
I was terrified before all those people.

59:05.500 --> 59:08.300
I'd ratherjump off that building.

59:08.600 --> 59:11.200
- You were wonderful.
- But it was for Cynthia.

59:11.500 --> 59:14.500
I remember that.
We were a group.

59:14.900 --> 59:17.600
We are a group!
We should do it and sing again.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.100
- Let's do it again. I wanna sing.
- Why?

59:20.400 --> 59:22.600
Why not? We'll blend.
We'll sing with you.

59:22.900 --> 59:26.200
- We'll blend!
- All of us altogether, real loud, OK?

59:26.600 --> 59:29.300
You're gonna sing with me, all right?

59:29.700 --> 59:34.200
To Cynthia.
Happy birthday wherever you are.

59:36.800 --> 59:38.500
All right, I'm ready.

59:41.400 --> 59:43.700
- Go!
- Pick a note!

59:44.100 --> 59:46.100
You don't own me!

59:47.400 --> 59:50.300
I'm not just one of your many toys

59:50.600 --> 59:55.800
You don't own me!
Don't say I can't go with other boys

59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.100
And don't tell me what to do!

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.700
And don't tell me what to say!

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.500
I sound horrible.
I hate you for this.

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:17.600
<i>Hi, Mom, it's your little spy</i>
<i>at the ad agency.</i>

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.200
<i>I can't talk now,</i>
<i>but have I got news for you!</i>

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:26.000
<i>I think it's time you got back</i>
<i>into the ad business. Call me.</i>

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.200
<i>Bren? It's Annie. Listen to this.</i>
<i>Aaron's partners want to sell-</i>

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:36.800
<i>- their share of the ad agency.</i>
<i>I could buy it if I had the money.</i>

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:40.500
<i>Can you imagine?</i>
<i>God, Aaron would die.</i>

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.200
<i>It's Brenda. Annie needs a</i>
<i>down payment for an ad agency.</i>

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.100
<i>Any idea where</i>
<i>she can get the money?</i>

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.600
<i>So, Elise sold me Bill's things</i>
<i>at a very reasonable price.</i>

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.200
<i>And I put it all up for auction.</i>

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:02.700
Your sale has generated
a great deal of excitement.

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:05.600
I want to raise funds
for my organization.

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:08.500
However, some lots
may fail to sell.

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:10.700
I wouldn't worry about that.

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.400

for the Lichtenstein.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.100

Absolutely sublime.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.500
It doesn't look very comfy.

Some Euro-trash. Shelly, you
can't let that plate leave the US.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.700

Thank you, thank you.

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:12.600
Shelly, what happened here?
$140,000 for a plate?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.300
$47,000 for a carpet?
A used carpet?

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:19.800
$300,000 for a Lamborghini?
Are you crazy?

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:23.900
I bought the car for you.
It was only 300 grand. It was a gift.

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.200
With my money you bought it!
I bought me the gift!

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.600
Jesus, I want a lifestyle!

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:32.000
With some ambiance and some
classic, eternal good taste.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:35.200
But not for $300,000, Shelly!

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.500
I can leave if you like.

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:51.800
It's not like you've
asked me to marry you.

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.000
Would you...

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.100
...unzip me?

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.200
Thank you.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:09.700
Shel, I lost my temper. I'm sorry.
The Lamborghini is a very good deal.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.900
- Hi, Jase. How was the game?
- Knicks lose again.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:23.100
Every player on that team is
a millionaire. They can't really lose.

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.500
- What do you think?
- That's not new, is it?

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:29.200
It's better than new.
It's the first time it's fit me in 3 years.

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:32.700
Look at me!
I have a waist, legs... Who knew?

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.500
How's your father?
Did you have fun?

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:38.600
- Yeah, but don't let that bother you.
- What a thing to say!

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:43.700
Jason, look. I remember how great
it was when we were a family.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.900
Even though we're not together now,
you still have both of us.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.700
You guys can't even pick out
my birthday card without a lawyer.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Jason, I know you worry
about your father.

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:59.000
He's a very good man.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:04.300
He's a very good,
very confused man.

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:08.500
But you don't have to
worry about me -

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:12.200
- because I'm going to be fine.
I'm lightening up, literally.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:17.300
And you know what?
Your father and I love you to pieces.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:21.600
- There, did I embarrass you?
- Almost.

01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:25.300
You want to go to a movie?
Me and you?

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:29.200
- Together...in public?
- Mom, I'm sorry.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:34.000
I was a little freaked out
by Dad getting engaged to Shelly.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:42.500
Oh, well... I can see how
that would rip your heart out.

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.800
Thanks, Mom.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.700
We gotta nail Bill.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.400
We gotta...slaughter him.

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.600
Right off the face of the planet.

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:16.800
Him and that tramp. That infant.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.300
- I need a drink.
- Holy moly, she's loaded.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.900
I know. I'm really worried.
She had me look at Bill's records -

01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:26.100
- and the guy's a saint.
He's clean.

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:30.500
- He's a saint with a great lawyer.
- What?

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:34.500
Are you saying
you can't find anything on him?

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:38.400
- I'm really sorry. I'll look again.
- This isn't fair.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:42.900
Aaron's going to be massacred.
Morty's won't know what hit him -

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:46.300
- and Bill's just gonna walk away.
With alimony!

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.200
We'll keep trying, Elise.

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:53.000
You'd better keep trying because
this is my life and my money!

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.500
What do you know?
You don't get it. You're civilians.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.700
You're just housewives.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
- That's it!
- No, wait.

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.900
You'll never understand.

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.000
Gimme that.
Excuse me. Give that back.

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:09.200
I say this with love compassion
and true sisterhood.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.800
You are full of shit!

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.500
What?

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.100
OK, alimony sucks.

01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:19.200
OK, you didn't get to play
a policewoman in a Wonderbra.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:20.899
But you grew up gorgeous.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:24.399
Thanks to Cher's pioneering efforts,
you still haven't hit puberty.

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.600
Once you were a terrific actress.

01:08:26.899 --> 01:08:28.600
You even got an Oscar to prove it.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.500
You spent your whole life
with people sucking up to you.

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:36.800
I'm sure Annie agrees with me that
your perception of life is a bit altered.

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:41.700
- Annie, do you agree with her?
- Come on!

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:43.899
Brenda, she's very upset.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.700
- Two pinheads!
- Wait a minute.

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.899
You've got some nerve.

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:52.200
I drink because I'm a sensitive
and highly strung person.

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.600
No! That's why your co-stars drink!

01:08:54.899 --> 01:08:56.600
I am not a drunk!

01:08:56.899 --> 01:09:00.100
Really?
Let's examine the evidence.

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:02.800
Look, all bottles!

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:05.300
And gallon jugs.

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:08.300
- I had guests.
- Who? Guns 'N' Roses?

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.100
Come on, you two.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:14.300
The enemy's out there, not in here,
and we are best friends!

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.100
After all those years,
you never called me.

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:20.200
- You were unlisted!
- You always gossip behind my back.

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:21.800
- You deserve it!
- You didn't invite me...

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:25.000
- ...to your son's Bar Mitzvah.
- You wouldn't have come.

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:28.000
- Yeah, it was in Hebrew.
- Oh, shut up!

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:31.000
You think a movie star
doesn't have feelings.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.800
You're wrong!
I do have feelings.

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:36.600
I'm an actress!
I have all of them.

01:09:36.899 --> 01:09:42.000
I wouldn't understand. I'm just a
housewife and a child to raise.

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:46.500
You were always jealous of me 'cause
I was blonde, beautiful and talented.

01:09:46.899 --> 01:09:50.000
- And I could have any guy I wanted.
- And did! Every guy!

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:52.700
Most of the senior class
and half the faculty.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.300
It was the 1960s.

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.200
Look at this place.
Is this where your fan club meets?

01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:59.400
Do you have ritual sacrifices?

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.800
Put that down!

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:03.900
- I won that!
- I remember.

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.400
- Your first "talkie".
- What did you ever win?

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:10.200
A pie-eating contest?
Best Ingestion.

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:14.600
Oh, no...

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:16.500
Brenda!

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.700
This is a Golden Globe.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.300
It's sacred!

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.800
It's...trademarked!

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:28.700
- Are you crazy?
- Stop it. Both of you!

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.200
Annie. You choose!
Who's your friend? Me or Brenda?

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.000
For once, make a decision.
Who's your buddy?

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:37.800
Some Beverly Hills science project...

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:40.200
...or a woman with her own aisle
at the supermarket.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:42.900
I'm sorry,
but I'm not getting involved with this.

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:45.300
You both have severe
psychological problems.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:50.300
I'm... I'm the nice one here.
I'm not like this.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.000
- What?
- Yes.

01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:54.100
- The nice one?
- Well, I mean I...

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.700
- You mean the rag mop, don't ya?
- Excuse me!

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.700
The one who can't manage
a simple declarative sentence!

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.100
The wimp! The wuss!

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:05.800
Well...I changed.
I'm much stronger than I used to be.

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:08.600
You are self-righteous!
You pipsqueek.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.600
Shut up, you arthritic sex kitten.

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:13.200
- Shut up, Morty's girl.
- Monique's mom!

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:16.600
Stop it!
You're both selfish assholes.

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:25.600
- Oh, my face! Oh, my God.
- That is enough.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.400
Have we forgotten
what we're doing here?

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:29.800
What has happened to us?

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:35.900
We're supposed to help each other,
not rip each other to shreds.

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.100
She's right.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:45.500
You know, I gotta say
I always wondered -

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:48.800
- how drunk Cynthia was
when she decided -

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:52.000
- to do a jackknife onto Park Ave.

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.000
- Mom.
- What's wrong? I came right over.

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:33.200
Things are not working out
the way I planned.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.600
And you called me?

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:38.700
Oh, my God!

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:57.700
I don't know.
It's just completely falling apart.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.700
We're at each other's throats.

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:04.600
It's like it's all my fault.
I'm just useless.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.100
- You are not!
- Honey, I am.

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:12.100
The past few weeks you've been
a totally different person.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:15.500
You've stopped apologizing
for yourself all the time.

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:17.400
I know. I'm sorry, honey.

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.600
This First Wives Club thing
can't work and it never could.

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:23.900
You make it work. It can.
You can make it work.

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.000
Call Brenda and Elise.

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:29.000
I can't call them.
What will I say to them?

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.500
This is just...
I should have seen this.

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:33.200
I should've seen this coming.

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:37.300
I know.
Why not write each of them a note!

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:41.500
Or maybe send a hanging plant.

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.400
Just a suggestion.

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.500
No, Mom.

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:52.600
No, it's over. It's over.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.600
Brenda?

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.800
I don't want to be like Cynthia.

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.600
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:26.500
Come on in.

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:31.200
- I've never been to your apartment.
- I know.

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:37.100
- Annie!
- Annie!

01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:42.600
Annie, what are you doing?

01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:44.200
Elise, it's your loft.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.100
I'm storing some things
or I'll burn them if you want.

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.700
- But why?
- Why? Are you kidding?

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.700
We've completely
embarrassed ourselves.

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:55.200
We've become exactly what
the world thinks we are.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.800
And our ex-husbands!
We are "The Three Witches".

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.500
Witches?
Well, I'll tell you something!

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:04.200
- Witches have powers.
- What?

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.800
They do!
They've powers for good <i>and</i> evil.

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.400
Brenda and I are OK now.

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:12.100
We've figured out what
we <i>think</i> we know what we want.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.100
I know what went wrong.
The whole crackpot idea went wrong.

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.700
Revenge and egos...
Thinking we could fix our silly lives.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.700
- Exactly! We were thinking too small.
- What are you talking about?

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.800
We were trying to get back
at our ex's, which is a start -

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.700
- but it isn't enough.
It's so petty and limited!

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.300
No wonder
we're snarling at each other.

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.700
No wonder we're
at each other's throats. Listen!

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:34.100
We have to take our plan
and expand it.

01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.100
First thing, we take care of
our own guys -

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.600
- because they really
have it coming. Then...we go global!

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.300
How?

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.000
Are you interested
because I'll tell you.

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:44.600
I don't know if I'm interested.

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:46.200
What if we erupt again?

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.300
Or Elise, what if you start drinking,
and, Brenda, you start sniping?

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:50.900
- Been there!
- Done that!

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.800
- It's not enough for me.
- Annie...

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:55.700
Take a good look at Elise.
Look at her!

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.500
I'm sober.
And I'm going to do the play.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
- Really?
- I'll be there front row opening night.

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:05.200
Our friendship is everything.
Don't leave.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.200
We can't fall apart now.

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:10.100
But even if we want to,
we don't have enough information.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.300
Of course, we do have stuff
on Aaron and Morty.

01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:16.400
But what about Bill?
We're still on square one.

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:21.700
No, not exactly.
I admit all he's done so far is legal...

01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:24.100
...as far as he knows.

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:27.900
- What do you mean?
- It's all a question of angles.

01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:30.400
- Are you in?
- Are you back?

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:36.000
- Talk.
- Well... After you.

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:46.000
I'm seriously thinking of taking
the role of Monique's Mom.

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:51.000
And I've been thinking
about who she is -

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:55.100
- what she's about. I'm sure you're
doing the same thing with Monique.

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:59.100
Sure. I've been thinking like,
streaks...

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.000
...just around my face.

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:02.800
Oh!

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:06.900
And what a beautiful face.

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:11.700
Anyway, the reason I called is
if we're going to work together -

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:15.100
- I think we should get to
know one another.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:16.700
It's important.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.600
Bill is so wrong.

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:23.200
- You are not Satan.
- Oh, stop!

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:30.200
Do you need a TV or a VCR
or a personal computer?

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:33.000
Who's the first name in top quality -

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:34.800
- low-cost appliances?

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:37.400
Let's ask this beautiful
young lady here.

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:39.700
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Why, hello!

01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:41.500
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:46.300
I'm in the market for a
low-quality, top-cost appliance.

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:48.200
- Cut!
- Shelly.

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.000
Top-quality, low-cost.

01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:54.600
- Morton Cushman.
- Yeah, why?

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.200
You have the right to remain silent.

01:18:56.500 --> 01:19:00.000
What's going on here?
I'm shooting a commercial.

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.600
Federal Marshals
acting on behalf of the IRS.

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:04.200
Bobby, call my lawyer.

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:13.900
<i>On November 28th,</i>
<i>at exactly 1400 hours -</i>

01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:18.400
<i>- Operation Hell's Fury</i>
<i>swung into action.</i>

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.900
- Morning.
- Hi.

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:37.800
- How's my day shaping up?
- Poor Daddy, it's going to be hell.

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:40.400
Your 9 o'clock's waiting
in the conference room.

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:41.900
Okie-dokie.

01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:50.200
So, where do I stand here now?

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:54.100
We'll also bill the expenses
including but not limited to...

01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:58.400
What is this?

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.500
Miss Eliot. Please...

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.600
- I'm begging you. Please.
- Brett, we love the new draft...

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:23.500
Phoebe's crazy about it.
She's going to read it.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.300
Elise, I'm trying
to make a movie here.

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.700
- Hold your calls.
- That was an important phonecall.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.200
- Where's my first check?
- Just sit down and shut up! OK?

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:35.400
Now, let's take a meeting.

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:42.900
- Hello, Sunshine!
- Welcome.

01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.700
This is kidnaping.

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:46.500
I will crucify you.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.700
You want to talk crucifixion?

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:50.900
Happy Easter, Morty.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.900
- Big deal!
- Letters from Brenda's father...

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:01.000
...about stocking your stores
with stolen merchandise.

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:04.800
- What do they call it in the tabloids?
- "Hot stuff".

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:08.400
Criminal activity.
You should be ashamed.

01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:11.300
Wake up and smell the audit.

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:15.400
Aaron, I just had
a little talk with Erik and Marc.

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:18.300
It seems the business
is very dysfunctional.

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:20.800
Sort of like our marriage.

01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:22.700
So...

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.500
I bought them out.

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:27.600
What?

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:32.100
- Yeah, I think we ought to go.
- That's a good idea.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.000
- Goodbye, Erik.
- Good luck to you.

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:37.600
- Annie
- Oh, Marc.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.400
- Love ya.
- I do love that suit.

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:48.300
You couldn't possibly pull off
something like this.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:49.900
Where did you get
this kind of money?

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:53.300
As agreed, I sold our assets
to a friend of mine.

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:55.600
Here's your half.

01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:58.100
Fifty cents?

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:02.600
Considering our history together,
I thought a dollar was very fair.

01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:08.900
Oh, all right!
Take it all.

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:11.200
- What do you want? Money?
- Every cent.

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.000
You're out of your mind.

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:15.000
You can hand it over and live
happily ever after.

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.700
You can give it to the government
and get 10 to 20.

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:19.700
Maybe Duarto can do your cell.

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:23.300
I see...bars.

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:25.300
You can't do this to me.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.500
- But I have done it.
- You wouldn't.

01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:29.800
You...couldn't.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.300
It seems I could and I did.

01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:37.100
You know what, Aaron?
I forgot how much fun work can be.

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:39.800
If you take my agency from me,
I'll walk.

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:42.700
- I'll take my clients with me.
- Be my guest.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.400
I'm not kidding!
I will take every single account.

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:49.400
This place without me....

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:53.100
- It would be worthless.
- I don't think so, babe.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:57.600
Not after the new
$45,000,000 account I just landed.

01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:00.800
New account?
What account?

01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:03.000
Morty's Electronics will be
under my control.

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:05.800
Advertising, marketing strategy...
Everything!

01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:11.000
You will stay on as President,
because after all...you are Morty.

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:14.600
You will receive a salary which will
keep you in the lifestyle -

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.300
- to which <i>I</i> think <i>you</i> should
become accustomed.

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:22.200
I don't see what else you can do.
It's this orjail.

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:25.900
So I dumped you for another woman.
Get over it!

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:28.600
Lift something. Wax something.
Have something peeled.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.100
You're right!
I hate to admit it, but I'm jealous.

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:36.600
Miss Lavelle is absolutely gorgeous.
She's a bright new star.

01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:40.000
lnterested, Elise?
Want to drink her blood?

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:43.700
How old is she, Bill? 25? 26?

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:46.400
- 21.
- Yeah.

01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:51.600
In about five years!
She's 16.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.800
- What?
- Two years ago...

01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:58.300
...she left high school
in Newkirk, Idaho.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:01.700
Should've done your homework, Bill.
I did.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:07.200
- A copy of her birth certificate.
- Oh, God. I didn't know.

01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:10.200
My God!
What are you going to do?

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:14.200
What am I going to do?

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:20.300
Right now, I'm just using the "f" word.
Felony!

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:24.200
I think we should continue
this discussion in my office.

01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:26.300
In your office?
Is that all you can do?

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:28.000
Think of yourself, yourself, yourself!

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:30.700
If you go through with this,
I'll have nothing.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.600
Everyone in town is looking
for the new guy.

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:34.100
How can I compete?

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:37.100
Who else is going to want me?
I'm 46 years old.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:39.100
I'd have to start from scratch.

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.800
I know just how you feel.

01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:45.300
Oh, Aaron...

01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:51.400
Grow from love.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.300
Annie McDuggan
FIRST WIVES CLUB

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:02.900
I don't hate you. I wish I could.
But you're still kind of cute -

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:07.700
- for a overbearing, cradle-robbing
Spandex-sucking criminal.

01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:09.900
So, I'm not going to take
all your money.

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.800
Don't misunderstand.
I'm going to take plenty.

01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:16.300
And I'm going to hang onto these
because I have a favor to ask.

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:18.800
Be there in two hours!

01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:21.900
While we were married,
I helped you.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.200
Now it's your turn to help others.

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:26.400
- Where are you going?
- To see Barbara Walters.

01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:29.300
- Oh, my God!
- Scared?

01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:31.200
You won't talk about this,
will you?

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.700
That depends on you.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.300
Be there at that address
in two hours, babe!

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.500
<i>What Brenda meant by</i>
<i>thinking globally-</i>

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:45.400
<i>- was that it wasn't enough</i>
<i>to make our ex-husbands suffer.</i>

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.800
<i>To do the truly charitable,</i>
<i>unselfish thing -</i>

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.800
<i>- we'd have to make them</i>
<i>suffer over and over again.</i>

01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:54.100
- So, what are you guys in for?
- Gentlemen!

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:56.900
And Daddy.

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:11.700
Honey...what's going on?
I can't handle more surprises today.

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.500
Oh, Daddy...

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:20.900
I'm a lesbian...

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.300
A big one.

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:30.700
Gentlemen, we've brought you
here today for a specific reason.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.400
This is not about
retaliation or negotiation -

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:38.200
- and this is not about
men versus women.

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.700
What is it then?
I'm sick of this, OK.

01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:45.600
- Please don't make her mad.
- No, no, this is not a revenge thing.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
This is about justice.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:51.100
Halfway through this operation
we realized -

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:55.100
- the only people who'd be
helped by revenge would be us.

01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:58.600
- We'd be no better than you.
- Happier but no better.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.100
Exhilarated but no better!
Ecstatic but no better!

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:03.700
So we thought again.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.800
A very dear friend of ours
died from neglect.

01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:10.100
You're going to help us make
sure that never happens again.

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.700
- Like hell we are.
- Can't make us.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.200
No... but Vito can. Joey can.

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:18.800
And Uncle Carmine can.

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.900
- What do we have to do?
- You have to pay.

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.200
<i>The funny thing was when we finally</i>
<i>had our ex's just where we wanted -</i>

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:07.000
<i>- revenge didn't seem so important.</i>

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:10.500
<i>So, we came up</i>
<i>with something better.</i>

01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:19.200
It's an important day here
in New York City for all women -

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:24.100
- at the opening of the Cynthia Griffin
Crisis Center for Women.

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:28.900
It's an amazing facility and I'm
here talking to three amazing women.

01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:31.600
Please tell me about your facility.

01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:36.600
This center is dedicated in memory
to our very dear friend Cynthia Swann.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.600
We plan on offering counseling -

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.900
- family therapy and, of course,
abuse intervention for all.

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:46.800
So many women are
in need here in Manhattan.

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:51.600
Can I ask whether it's true that the
idea for this center started because -

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.300
- each of you had a husband
that left you for a younger woman?

01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:57.000
Yes, yes.

01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:00.300
They really are amazing women.
Good for you!

01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:04.600
Congratulations for all the great work.
New York thanks you.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.700
I'm asking you as a favor.
Come in for one minute with me.

01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:20.200
- We have to talk about the wedding.
- What are you talking about?

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.200
- You won't even set a date.
- Exactly.

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:25.300
Because this isn't working.
I am not feeling special.

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:29.400
I am not feeling loved.
And now this place.

01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:32.600
Morty, I am not Brenda.

01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:36.800
- No, you're not!
- Duh!

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:07.300
Ivana...

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.900
I want to thank you
for coming so much.

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.900
- You're an angel.
- Of course, Elise.

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:14.600
Thank you so much again.

01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:17.100
Ladies, you have to be strong
and independent.

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.200
- And remember?
- What?

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:21.900
Don't get mad.
Get everything!

01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.600
- Mrs. Goldberg?
- Yes.

01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:31.500
Carmine Morelli...
Brenda's uncle.

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:35.800
- Yes, of course.
- Nice to meet you.

01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:49.200
What a wonderful occasion!
Helping people through a buffet!

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.900
- Mom, it's a great party.
- Thank you, sweetie.

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:56.900
You know, Annie,
this place is terrific.

01:32:57.300 --> 01:33:01.100
I think you did the right thing,
divorcing Aaron.

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:03.400
I salute you.

01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:05.100
I have something to add.

01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:09.500
Annie, you're not
getting any younger. Or thinner.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.600
- You know what I think you need?
- No.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.900
Absolutely nothing!

01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:22.300
Baby...
Sweetheart!

01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:32.700
Come on, Jason.
Just one time around the floor.

01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:36.600
- Come on. Get real.
- I'm your mother. I command you.

01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:39.600
You gotta have something
to tell your shrink.

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:46.200
Look at this.
Isn't this fantastic? I'm so proud.

01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:47.800
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Morty.

01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:51.200
Dad, save me.
She's trying to dance with me.

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:52.900
Leave him alone.
He's a good kid.

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:55.900
- I know that.
- Not like his Dad.

01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:59.400
- What?
- I'm getting out of the line of fire.

01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:07.700
- You look good, Bren.
- You too.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.300
- Thank you.
- Where's Shel?

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:13.100
- In the car.
- Glove compartment?

01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:15.800
Trunk.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.800
Let me ask you a question.

01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:21.400
Was I this old
when we were married?

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:24.800
Yes. But I liked you this old.

01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:26.800
Me too.

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.800
- Wanna?
- Sure.

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:57.400
<i>It was clear that Brenda and Morty</i>
<i>were headed for a reconciliation.</i>

01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:00.400
<i>Elise was dating an actor</i>
<i>in her hit play.</i>

01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:04.100
<i>As for me,</i>
<i>Aaron and Dr. Rosen split up.</i>

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:07.300
<i>He wants to come home again</i>
<i>and he feels emotionally ready-</i>

01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:11.800
<i>- to recommit to an equitable</i>
<i>and caring relationship.</i>

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.500
<i>I told him to drop dead.</i>

01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:27.000
- Excuse me, got a light?
- Sure.

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:31.400
- Nice car. Used to have one myself.
- Thanks.

01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:35.500
So, what's going on in there? Is it just
lot of battered women dancing?

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.400
Yeah, sort of.
Not really my scene.

01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:40.400
Me, neither.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
So, you here with anybody?

01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:49.000
- Not really.
- How old are you?

01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:55.400
Look at this place.
It's just a total mess.

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:59.600
- But a gorgeous mess.
- You know, I can't believe it.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.300
We actually did it.
We accomplished it together.

01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:06.800
I know. We did it.

01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:10.500
Oh, God,
I wish Cynthia was here.

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:13.300
She is...
She is in a way.

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:18.900
OK, we're 1990s women.
What is it we really, really need?

01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:22.700
- You are never going to change.
- And I hope not.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.900
I hope we never change
and we always stay the same...

01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:28.300
Tired and happy.

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:31.600
- Maybe a little bit brave.
- Brave?

01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:34.900
- You mean, "brave".
- What do you mean?

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.900
- You don't own me
-You're not funny!

01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:41.700
No way. I'm out.

01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:45.400
Stop it! No, I'm not gonna...

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:48.700
- You don't own me
- Leave me alone.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.400
Don't say I can't go
with other boys

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:01.800
And don't tell me what to do

01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:04.600
And don't tell me what to say

01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:07.600
And when I go out with you

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.200
Don't put me on display

01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:13.000
- Pretty good!
- You remembered!

01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:18.300
You don't own me!
Don't try to change me in any way

01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:21.100
You don't own me

01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:24.400
Don't tie me down
'cause I'll never stay

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.600
I don't tell you what to say

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.500
I don't tell you what to do

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:34.500
So just let me be myself

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:37.200
That's all I ask of you

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.900
I'm young and I love to be young

01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:42.800
I'm free and I love to be free

01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:45.600
To live my life the way that I want

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.500
To say and do whatever I please
