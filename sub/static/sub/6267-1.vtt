01:22.547 --> 01:23.882
Clear your mind.

01:25.583 --> 01:27.853
Clear your mind of all thought.

01:30.556 --> 01:32.091
Now, go back.

01:33.324 --> 01:37.529
Go back in time to
where it all began.

01:38.630 --> 01:39.999
And tell me a story.

01:42.267 --> 01:44.235
Tell me what happened.

02:06.925 --> 02:08.693
Police,
open the door.

02:09.961 --> 02:12.865
I repeat, this is the
police. Open the door.

02:14.065 --> 02:16.968
If you can hear me,
stand back from the door.

02:18.069 --> 02:19.671
Stand back from the door!

02:28.980 --> 02:30.049
Power's out.

02:56.742 --> 02:57.877
I found somethin'.

02:59.143 --> 03:00.313
What is it?

03:02.213 --> 03:03.148
Blood.

03:12.690 --> 03:14.026
Door's locked from the inside.

03:16.128 --> 03:17.630
Shoot out the lock.

03:17.996 --> 03:18.863
Stand by.

03:43.921 --> 03:44.889
My God.

03:53.831 --> 03:55.000
What's happening?

03:56.267 --> 03:57.937
Where are you now?

03:59.438 --> 04:01.240
The book is called
The Fear of Darkness

04:01.272 --> 04:04.109
and it is best described
as the rational explanation

04:04.141 --> 04:05.943
of our fear of ghosts,
spirits, and things

04:05.976 --> 04:07.779
that go bump in the night.

04:07.813 --> 04:09.048
That's right.

04:09.081 --> 04:11.183
These things, they don't
really exist outside

04:11.216 --> 04:12.850
our imagination.

04:12.884 --> 04:14.420
They're phantoms of the mind

04:14.452 --> 04:17.356
and the reason they're there
is that we have this deep

04:17.387 --> 04:19.390
unconscious fear of death

04:19.423 --> 04:21.959
and they are projections
of that fear.

04:21.993 --> 04:24.930
Hallucinations projected
into the external world.

04:24.962 --> 04:26.130
Okay,
so what would you like

04:26.164 --> 04:28.099
people to take out of this?

04:28.133 --> 04:30.169
My goal is to make
sense of the world

04:30.202 --> 04:32.037
and as a clinical psychologist,

04:32.070 --> 04:34.272
I do that through seeking
scientific explanation

04:34.306 --> 04:37.075
for a range of
experiences and emotions.

04:37.109 --> 04:38.978
Like
our fear of darkness.

04:39.311 --> 04:41.947
You were afraid of the dark
when you were young, right?

04:41.979 --> 04:42.813
Terrified.

04:42.847 --> 04:45.083
It's one of our
most basic fears.

04:45.116 --> 04:46.984
Hardwired into our
brains from a time

04:47.017 --> 04:49.253
when we feared
predators of the night.

04:49.287 --> 04:50.988
Sleeping around a campfire,

04:51.022 --> 04:54.125
it wasn't just for comfort,
it was for protection.

04:54.159 --> 04:57.096
And children have
wonderful imaginations.

04:57.128 --> 04:58.296
When we're young,
we create all kinds of

04:58.330 --> 05:01.433
fantastic monsters that might
be out there waiting for us.

05:01.465 --> 05:04.102
Research has shown
that as we grow older,

05:04.135 --> 05:06.171
our fear of monsters
grows less and less,

05:06.203 --> 05:08.873
but not our fear
of the darkness.

05:12.077 --> 05:13.378
Spokesman
for the weather bureau

05:13.411 --> 05:15.012
explains the phenomenon.

05:15.046 --> 05:17.750
The sun is about 400 times

05:17.782 --> 05:19.984
wider than the moon,
but it's also

05:20.017 --> 05:23.087
about 400 times further away.

05:23.121 --> 05:24.957
So, at the height
of a total eclipse,

05:24.989 --> 05:28.126
the moon will completely
block out the sun's lines.

05:28.159 --> 05:29.962
This
rational explanation

05:29.995 --> 05:31.764
of what happens
during a solar eclipse

05:31.796 --> 05:34.499
is in stark contrast
to ancient beliefs.

05:34.532 --> 05:37.001
The Inka's, for example,
thought an eclipse

05:37.034 --> 05:39.003
was a demon devouring the sun.

05:44.008 --> 05:45.276
The blood is definitely his?

05:45.310 --> 05:47.747
Yeah. Jeremy Winter's.

05:48.046 --> 05:49.548
He was up there
with Sky Williams.

05:49.580 --> 05:53.184
Blood's DNA matches his
parents. It's definitely his.

05:53.217 --> 05:54.552
But you still
haven't found him.

05:54.585 --> 05:55.887
Searched everywhere.

05:55.921 --> 05:58.022
I even dragged
the lake. Nothing.

05:59.291 --> 06:00.492
There's the keys
to the lake house

06:00.525 --> 06:02.294
if you'd like to
have a look yourself.

06:04.395 --> 06:05.997
We found evidence that
they're experimenting

06:06.030 --> 06:07.198
with DMT.

06:07.231 --> 06:09.167
Dimethyltryptamine?

06:09.200 --> 06:10.902
What do you know about it?

06:11.402 --> 06:14.039
Only that it's a very
powerful hallucinogen.

06:14.539 --> 06:16.909
What did she say when you
first interviewed her?

06:18.476 --> 06:20.079
She won't talk to us.

06:21.111 --> 06:23.214
When she came in, she was

06:23.882 --> 06:25.117
completely out of it.

06:25.549 --> 06:27.118
We've now got her
heavily sedated,

06:27.152 --> 06:29.854
but she's still not
saying anything.

06:31.121 --> 06:32.457
What do you think happened?

06:33.491 --> 06:35.193
Well, the simplest
explanation is usually

06:35.226 --> 06:36.294
the correct one.

06:36.327 --> 06:37.897
And that is?

06:39.630 --> 06:41.000
She murdered him.

06:42.601 --> 06:44.470
It's not that
simple though, is it?

06:45.303 --> 06:46.839
No.

06:47.137 --> 06:49.508
No, Jeremy Winters
called emergency services

06:49.541 --> 06:51.410
at 10:45 pm.

06:52.544 --> 06:56.113
Exactly 17 minutes later,
two of our uniform

06:56.147 --> 06:57.315
were on the scene.

06:58.416 --> 07:00.118
See, that's just not
enough time for one person

07:00.150 --> 07:02.386
to kill him and then
dispose of the body

07:02.419 --> 07:04.289
somewhere where
we can't find him.

07:04.322 --> 07:06.191
In the cellar where
this photo was taken,

07:06.224 --> 07:08.027
the door was locked
from the inside.

07:10.061 --> 07:11.996
She definitely did it but,

07:12.029 --> 07:12.998
she didn't act alone.

07:13.030 --> 07:14.432
Someone helped her.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.037
And we want you to find out who.

07:40.592 --> 07:41.493
Sky?

07:45.597 --> 07:47.933
My name is Sarah Faithforth

07:48.233 --> 07:50.469
and I'm a clinical psychologist.

07:52.003 --> 07:53.539
I'm here to help you.

07:55.239 --> 07:56.941
To find out what happened.

08:00.412 --> 08:02.548
Sky, you have some
marks on your face.

08:03.647 --> 08:05.150
Like birth marks.

08:06.183 --> 08:07.986
They're most likely
an allergic reaction

08:08.019 --> 08:09.655
to the drug you took.

08:12.390 --> 08:14.993
Your mind is blocking
out what happened

08:15.025 --> 08:19.163
to protect you and this
can affect you physically.

08:20.597 --> 08:23.401
But those memories
are still in there.

08:25.370 --> 08:27.039
So, what I'm gonna
do is I'm going

08:27.072 --> 08:28.173
to bring them to the surface

08:28.205 --> 08:30.174
in a carefully managed way.

08:31.176 --> 08:33.111
A way that will not hurt you.

08:36.179 --> 08:37.448
Is that okay?

08:48.193 --> 08:50.095
Sky, this is nurse Roke.

08:52.697 --> 08:55.100
She's gonna make you feel
a bit more comfortable.

09:14.452 --> 09:16.587
Sky, we're going to
put this sensor on.

09:16.621 --> 09:18.723
It will measure
your brain waves.

09:32.236 --> 09:33.404
Just your hand.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.174
Thank you.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.489
I'm gonna
turn the lights out now.

10:03.201 --> 10:06.138
Sky, I want you to focus on
the flame of this candle.

10:09.707 --> 10:14.212
You need to trust me.
Please try.

10:18.850 --> 10:21.119
Imagine that the
flame of the candle

10:21.151 --> 10:24.489
is drawing you in closer

10:25.090 --> 10:26.258
and closer,

10:27.391 --> 10:29.060
until you're one with it.

10:32.697 --> 10:34.131
Sky, I want you
to take your mind

10:34.164 --> 10:35.601
back to the other night

10:35.866 --> 10:38.202
when you were with
your friend, Jeremy.

10:41.773 --> 10:46.145
You took a drug called
Dimethyltryptamine, DMT.

10:48.679 --> 10:50.149
What happened next?

11:06.463 --> 11:08.132
What have you taken?

11:08.632 --> 11:11.302
Acting crazy.
Come back.

11:12.603 --> 11:13.671
Come back inside.

11:14.872 --> 11:16.541
Sky, where are you?

11:45.636 --> 11:47.872
There, let's go inside.

11:50.475 --> 11:51.409
Let's go.

11:55.947 --> 11:57.116
You see that?

11:59.384 --> 12:00.351
Right there.

12:02.220 --> 12:03.555
There's nothing there.

12:05.689 --> 12:06.858
No, I swear.

12:07.324 --> 12:08.626
There's something
coming out of the water.

12:09.660 --> 12:12.296
Sky, I cannot see anything.

12:16.668 --> 12:17.802
Call the police.

12:17.834 --> 12:18.703
Sky.

13:00.712 --> 13:01.580
Sky.

13:03.448 --> 13:04.650
Sky, what are you doing?

13:06.550 --> 13:08.219
You're really
startin' to scare me.

13:11.422 --> 13:12.724
Emergency services.

13:12.756 --> 13:13.991
What service do you require?

13:14.025 --> 13:14.927
Police.

13:24.468 --> 13:25.636
Where
are you calling from?

13:25.669 --> 13:28.406
My parents. The Winters.

13:29.439 --> 13:31.642
Holiday house on
Lake Providence,

13:31.675 --> 13:33.578
Lake Providence Drive.

13:34.044 --> 13:37.949
You have to help. Please.

13:38.949 --> 13:39.850
Hello?

13:41.586 --> 13:42.520
Hello?

13:45.423 --> 13:46.291
Sky.

13:48.659 --> 13:49.928
Sky, where are you?

13:51.862 --> 13:53.931
Sky, where are you?

13:59.971 --> 14:01.273
Sky.

15:18.750 --> 15:19.951
Sky, listen to me.

15:20.918 --> 15:23.020
Who is doing this to you?

15:23.053 --> 15:25.023
Help me!

15:25.722 --> 15:28.025
Sky, listen to me.
Who is doing this to you?

15:28.793 --> 15:30.495
Who is doing this to you?

15:30.528 --> 15:33.932
Help me please! Help!

15:42.840 --> 15:44.009
She's flat lined.

15:45.175 --> 15:46.377
Okay, that's enough.

15:46.410 --> 15:47.345
Hold on.

15:47.911 --> 15:48.712
She knows what she's doing.

15:48.746 --> 15:49.948
Just let her handle it.

15:54.084 --> 15:55.753
How long since we lost her?

15:55.786 --> 15:57.020
20 seconds.

15:57.053 --> 15:59.023
Okay, Sky, you're
going to listen to me.

15:59.055 --> 16:01.992
It is all over.
No one is attacking you.

16:03.961 --> 16:05.029
Where are you now?

16:05.062 --> 16:06.063
30.

16:06.097 --> 16:07.631
What can you see?

16:07.932 --> 16:10.534
Sky, listen to me.
What is happening now?

16:11.535 --> 16:12.737
Answer me.

16:13.036 --> 16:14.605
Sky, can you hear me?

16:15.173 --> 16:17.142
Listen to me. Listen
to what I'm saying.

16:17.174 --> 16:18.943
50 seconds.
Get her out of there.

16:20.077 --> 16:21.645
You are going to move forward

16:21.678 --> 16:22.981
to when you were conscious.

16:23.014 --> 16:24.082
Still nothing.

16:24.115 --> 16:26.484
Okay, I am going to
count backwards from seven

16:26.516 --> 16:29.453
and when I get to one, you
are going to wake up, okay?

16:29.821 --> 16:33.758
Seven, six, five, four,

16:33.790 --> 16:37.561
three, two, one.

16:38.228 --> 16:39.130
One.

16:40.097 --> 16:41.566
One!

16:41.598 --> 16:43.033
Okay, we're gonna
have to move her.

17:02.053 --> 17:02.986
I've got something.

17:03.020 --> 17:04.855
Still no signal.

17:23.673 --> 17:24.809
You're fine.

17:25.041 --> 17:26.178
Pulse back to normal.

17:28.178 --> 17:28.947
Where am I?

17:28.979 --> 17:29.948
You're okay.

17:31.082 --> 17:32.551
Everything's fine now Sky.

17:37.287 --> 17:39.089
What is the last
thing you remember?

17:41.993 --> 17:43.160
I took this drug.

17:43.861 --> 17:45.063
And then what happened?

17:49.132 --> 17:51.101
It was really beautiful.

17:54.671 --> 17:56.040
And then it all ended.

17:59.043 --> 18:00.712
It was like a nightmare.

18:03.714 --> 18:05.082
I tried to turn on the light

18:10.955 --> 18:12.991
and then it started
coming towards me.

18:13.024 --> 18:15.159
What was attacking you Sky?

18:15.191 --> 18:17.027
I don't know.

18:17.061 --> 18:19.030
Why were you trying
to turn on the lights?

18:19.063 --> 18:21.131
I wanted to keep it out.

18:22.198 --> 18:25.035
I didn't want it to come inside.

18:25.335 --> 18:26.837
What was it Sky?

18:30.740 --> 18:32.042
Darkness.

19:08.044 --> 19:12.217
Hi Mom. Mom, it's Sarah.

19:13.918 --> 19:15.186
No, it's Sarah.

19:18.823 --> 19:21.025
It's good. Yep.

19:21.792 --> 19:22.659
No, it's going well.

19:22.692 --> 19:25.129
I got a new case today.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.064
And it's interesting.

19:31.168 --> 19:32.270
What did you say?

19:36.040 --> 19:37.142
I know.

19:38.141 --> 19:39.977
I know. I wish I was there too.

19:41.344 --> 19:42.279
Yeah.

19:43.246 --> 19:45.115
But I'll see you really soon.

19:46.883 --> 19:47.818
Okay.

19:52.055 --> 19:53.057
Do you have to go?

19:54.691 --> 19:55.326
Okay.

19:57.093 --> 19:58.095
Alright.

19:58.329 --> 20:00.065
Well, I'll speak
to you tomorrow.

20:01.998 --> 20:03.066
I love you.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.669
I know. I miss you too.

20:04.701 --> 20:08.105
Okay, bye Mom.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.314
That scar's not new?

21:26.082 --> 21:28.085
My Dad gave it
to me when he died.

21:30.019 --> 21:31.188
What happened?

21:32.389 --> 21:35.860
He was driving
us home one night

21:37.894 --> 21:39.163
and had too much to drink.

21:41.031 --> 21:43.168
Drove off the road into a tree.

21:46.469 --> 21:48.105
Killed himself and Mom.

21:50.807 --> 21:54.211
I was in the back with Emily.

21:54.945 --> 21:56.014
Who's Emily?

21:57.180 --> 21:58.850
She was like my best friend.

22:00.083 --> 22:02.320
Like a imaginary
friend type thing.

22:03.053 --> 22:04.089
I see.

22:13.429 --> 22:14.466
When was this?

22:16.100 --> 22:17.034
I was seven.

22:19.169 --> 22:20.237
It was my birthday.

22:23.908 --> 22:27.211
Yes, I'm still mad at him.

22:27.244 --> 22:28.813
I still hate him.

22:32.582 --> 22:34.052
For what he did to Mom,

22:37.588 --> 22:38.890
what he did to Emily.

22:40.123 --> 22:41.358
What happened to her?

22:42.293 --> 22:43.527
She disappeared.

22:46.596 --> 22:48.031
Never saw her again.

22:57.440 --> 22:58.876
Where's Jeremy?

23:00.945 --> 23:02.380
Well, we were hoping
you might know that.

23:06.316 --> 23:08.051
Sky, when you were
under hypnosis,

23:08.084 --> 23:10.087
you called out for
someone to help you.

23:11.589 --> 23:12.957
Was that Jeremy?

23:14.123 --> 23:15.092
No.

23:15.124 --> 23:16.126
Who was it?

23:22.065 --> 23:22.900
It was you.

23:26.469 --> 23:28.305
Sky is presenting
with all the symptoms

23:28.339 --> 23:30.107
of a drug-induced psychosis.

23:30.140 --> 23:31.508
Caused by the DMT.

23:31.542 --> 23:32.342
Right.

23:32.575 --> 23:33.977
It makes the most sense.

23:34.011 --> 23:35.413
The hallucinations, the
belief that there was

23:35.446 --> 23:36.948
another entity with them,

23:36.980 --> 23:38.849
but that's only a projection.

23:38.882 --> 23:41.552
Okay, with all due respect,
what the hell does that mean?

23:41.584 --> 23:44.389
Her hallucination
makes her unconscious.

23:46.055 --> 23:48.592
Okay, so there was
nobody else there?

23:49.192 --> 23:50.894
So, she must have done it.

23:51.160 --> 23:53.464
Look, the best
thing we can do is

23:53.496 --> 23:55.632
allow Sarah more time with her.

23:55.666 --> 23:57.068
She's only had one
session with her.

23:57.101 --> 23:58.135
Well how long is
that gonna take?

23:58.168 --> 23:59.637
I don't know.

23:59.669 --> 24:01.605
It's very hard to put a
timeline on this sort of thing.

24:01.639 --> 24:03.875
Well, I'm sorry,
I don't have time.

24:03.908 --> 24:05.575
I've got a dead boy
lying out there somewhere

24:05.609 --> 24:07.477
and lots of people
asking lots of question.

24:07.511 --> 24:09.180
So, I need some answers.

24:14.118 --> 24:16.020
Okay, you've got 48 hours.

24:18.022 --> 24:19.123
We'll review the situation then.

24:19.156 --> 24:20.158
Fine.

24:30.034 --> 24:31.268
Entity.

24:33.169 --> 24:37.007
The DMT took Sky into a
completely different world.

24:37.041 --> 24:38.909
One in which her
boyfriend was killed

24:38.942 --> 24:40.110
and she was attacked.

24:40.143 --> 24:41.444
You mean she believes

24:41.477 --> 24:43.247
they went into another world?

24:43.680 --> 24:45.283
That's what I just said.

24:45.315 --> 24:46.483
No you didn't.

24:46.516 --> 24:48.186
You said they were taken
into another world.

24:49.285 --> 24:52.390
Sarah, Sky nearly
died under your care.

24:52.422 --> 24:54.090
I do know what I'm doing.

24:54.123 --> 24:56.126
I just want you to
be careful, that's all.

24:57.628 --> 24:59.397
Sky could be very dangerous.

25:00.163 --> 25:01.598
She's confused.

25:03.367 --> 25:05.904
She lost both her parents
when she was very young.

25:06.736 --> 25:08.104
She blames her father for that

25:08.138 --> 25:10.041
and for what happened to Emily.

25:10.073 --> 25:11.141
Who's Emily?

25:12.142 --> 25:13.643
She's an early
manifestation of a possible

25:13.677 --> 25:16.113
dissociative identity disorder.

25:16.380 --> 25:18.448
You mean imaginary friend.

25:19.082 --> 25:21.218
Didn't you have one of those
when you were a little girl?

25:22.285 --> 25:24.087
Would that be a problem?

25:24.287 --> 25:25.689
Of course not.

25:25.723 --> 25:27.959
But what happened with
your father might be.

25:30.561 --> 25:34.398
Look Sarah, I just
want you to be careful.

25:34.430 --> 25:36.700
That's all. Please.

26:20.343 --> 26:22.545
Sky, listen to
me. Who is doing this to you?

26:22.579 --> 26:25.149
Help me!

26:27.450 --> 26:29.687
Help me!

26:51.240 --> 26:53.576
Sky, listen to
me. Who is doing this to you?

26:53.610 --> 26:56.781
Help me!

26:59.115 --> 27:01.518
Help me!

27:32.248 --> 27:33.217
Hi.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.455
Yes, yes, I'll...

27:38.221 --> 27:39.256
I'll go out there tomorrow.

27:40.490 --> 27:43.093
Okay. I'll come and
see you afterwards.

27:44.194 --> 27:44.796
Sure.

27:47.698 --> 27:49.100
Nick, this...

27:50.200 --> 27:52.102
there's something a little
bit strange going on.

27:56.140 --> 27:56.841
No, that's fine.

27:56.873 --> 27:58.275
We can talk about it tomorrow.

27:58.742 --> 28:01.512
Okay. Sure.

28:02.778 --> 28:03.713
Bye.

32:20.836 --> 32:23.706
So, surrealism as an
artistic movement began

32:23.739 --> 32:27.844
in the early 1920's
and it drew heavily

32:27.878 --> 32:30.948
on Froyd's relatively
new concept at the time

32:30.980 --> 32:33.116
of the unconscious mind,

32:33.917 --> 32:36.986
but more than half a
century before Froyd,

32:37.019 --> 32:41.057
before surrealism,
we have Louis Carol's

32:41.091 --> 32:43.561
Adventures of Alice
and Wonderland.

32:43.826 --> 32:45.028
Perhaps you've heard of it.

32:46.028 --> 32:48.931
Now, this can be interpreted

32:48.965 --> 32:52.002
as an exploration
of similar concepts

32:52.936 --> 32:55.872
where Alice journeys
from the real world

32:55.906 --> 32:59.076
of her conscious mind
into the surreal world

32:59.109 --> 33:00.778
of her unconscious.

33:02.545 --> 33:03.980
Louis Carol is said
to have suffered

33:04.014 --> 33:08.851
from quite severe migraines,
which in certain circumstances

33:08.884 --> 33:10.553
are known to cause
hallucinations,

33:10.586 --> 33:14.824
which may be responsible
for some of this imagery.

33:15.559 --> 33:19.630
Either that or he was
just really, really high.

33:21.063 --> 33:24.000
Okay, that's it. Your
assignments are due on Friday.

33:24.868 --> 33:27.138
Be good. Don't do
anything I wouldn't do.

33:35.078 --> 33:36.980
The only difference
between a mad man

33:37.013 --> 33:39.683
and me is that I'm not mad.

33:39.716 --> 33:41.083
Salvador Dali.

33:41.117 --> 33:42.586
I'm Sarah Faithforth.

33:42.619 --> 33:43.788
Matt Sorinsen.

33:44.653 --> 33:47.525
You're definitely
not what I expected.

33:49.926 --> 33:52.429
I told the police
everything that I know.

33:52.629 --> 33:53.964
They were both in my class.

33:54.898 --> 33:57.034
She was obviously
incredibly intelligent.

33:58.067 --> 33:59.235
He seemed like a sweet kid.

33:59.268 --> 34:01.037
I didn't know they
were going out but,

34:01.938 --> 34:03.006
I don't know what else to say.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.042
Did you know they
were experimenting

34:05.074 --> 34:07.076
with a powerful hallucinogen?

34:07.110 --> 34:07.911
What?

34:08.210 --> 34:10.079
Dimethyltryptamine.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.081
Is that what happened?

34:14.217 --> 34:15.985
Do you have any idea where
they might have got it?

34:16.887 --> 34:17.822
No.

34:19.889 --> 34:21.025
God, that's -

34:21.291 --> 34:22.860
- What?

34:23.693 --> 34:24.960
It's just awful to
think that they would have

34:24.994 --> 34:26.697
taken such a risk.

34:27.197 --> 34:28.565
I don't know.

34:29.099 --> 34:31.101
The idea of travelling
to inner space,

34:31.132 --> 34:33.070
to a reality beyond this world,

34:34.036 --> 34:34.972
might sound pretty
exciting if it came

34:35.005 --> 34:38.074
from someone you really
respected and admired.

34:39.943 --> 34:41.710
Nice talking to you, Sarah.

34:42.579 --> 34:43.514
Wait.

34:44.981 --> 34:45.983
I'm sorry.

34:46.916 --> 34:48.117
Look, I really need your help.

34:49.818 --> 34:50.719
How?

34:50.753 --> 34:52.956
Tell me everything
you know about DMT.

34:54.956 --> 34:56.994
It's manufactured in home labs

34:58.128 --> 35:02.066
then turned into
small crystal cubes.

35:02.932 --> 35:07.604
Then it's ingested orally,
smoked or injected.

35:08.905 --> 35:10.908
What do you tell
your students about it?

35:11.640 --> 35:13.876
It was first
synthesized in the west

35:13.910 --> 35:17.981
by British chemists,
Richard Mensk in 1931,

35:18.014 --> 35:20.017
but its active
ingredients are ancient

35:20.050 --> 35:24.053
used by Amazonian Indians
in their spiritual rituals.

35:24.253 --> 35:27.525
Do you tell your
students you've taken it?

35:27.990 --> 35:28.958
Yes I do.

35:29.858 --> 35:32.094
I was part of a controlled study

35:32.128 --> 35:34.131
at the University of New Mexico

35:34.164 --> 35:35.999
where I was doing my doctorate.

35:36.599 --> 35:37.834
Three of us took it.

35:38.200 --> 35:39.602
And what happened?

35:43.106 --> 35:46.810
One of us, very
straight, science mind

35:47.644 --> 35:49.313
said that he saw God

35:50.046 --> 35:51.814
and that she was beautiful.

35:52.715 --> 35:56.853
Another saw the world
as it really is,

35:57.988 --> 36:01.725
primeval energies colliding.

36:03.093 --> 36:06.797
No use for language
or rational thought.

36:07.363 --> 36:08.865
That was you.

36:11.401 --> 36:15.238
In here is an almost
impenetrable shield

36:15.271 --> 36:18.342
that protects the brain
from any bad stuff

36:18.374 --> 36:20.643
that can get into your blood.

36:21.110 --> 36:25.148
But DMT crushes that barrier.

36:28.050 --> 36:30.053
Once that happens, your mind...

36:32.956 --> 36:34.191
it's not as you knew it.

36:37.293 --> 36:38.896
What about the third?

36:44.367 --> 36:45.836
He was a nice guy.

36:48.003 --> 36:51.874
Not the sort of person
to make things up.

36:52.709 --> 36:53.777
What does that mean?

37:00.050 --> 37:02.785
DMT, it can

37:03.419 --> 37:05.055
open your mind

37:05.822 --> 37:07.858
to other planes of existence

37:08.925 --> 37:12.363
where humans can interact
with other beings.

37:13.329 --> 37:15.064
You don't believe that.

37:15.932 --> 37:16.867
Why not?

37:18.101 --> 37:19.903
That was his experience.

37:21.970 --> 37:23.974
He described in detail

37:25.075 --> 37:27.111
the presence of an alien

37:28.010 --> 37:30.980
and I'm not talkin' about
a little green martian.

37:32.782 --> 37:37.153
I'm talkin' about a
force, malevolent,

37:38.822 --> 37:40.024
terrifying.

37:45.028 --> 37:46.964
It doesn't mean
that it happened.

37:48.298 --> 37:51.401
Maybe DMT allows you to
cross over the barrier

37:51.434 --> 37:54.303
between the unconscious
and the conscious mind.

37:55.137 --> 37:56.706
It's like when you're dreaming.

37:57.139 --> 38:00.142
What you experience
feels real at the time.

38:00.175 --> 38:01.210
Then you wake up.

38:01.244 --> 38:02.412
Exactly.

38:04.046 --> 38:06.115
Yes well, that's
what happened to me.

38:07.349 --> 38:10.086
But, that's not what
happened to him.

38:12.155 --> 38:13.390
He's never coming back.

38:19.061 --> 38:20.096
Okay.

38:22.398 --> 38:23.767
I'm Sky.

38:24.334 --> 38:26.236
I find out about
this incredible drug.

38:26.269 --> 38:28.505
I also find out that I
have a one in three chance

38:28.537 --> 38:31.006
of having a
terrifying experience.

38:31.039 --> 38:32.074
Why take it?

38:32.108 --> 38:33.010
Right.

38:34.209 --> 38:35.713
Well, you met her.

38:36.246 --> 38:37.814
She's a risk taker.

38:39.948 --> 38:42.151
She first took ecstasy
when she was 13.

38:46.356 --> 38:47.791
How do you know that?

38:51.026 --> 38:52.262
She told me.

38:56.099 --> 38:57.468
Did you have an
affair with her?

38:59.001 --> 39:00.070
No I didn't.

39:04.039 --> 39:06.075
It's been nice talking to you

39:07.276 --> 39:08.412
but I have to go.

39:19.856 --> 39:22.258
Help me!

39:32.267 --> 39:33.470
So what are you saying?

39:38.340 --> 39:40.043
What if Sky made
contact with something

39:40.075 --> 39:41.278
from another world?

39:41.610 --> 39:42.945
Something alien.

39:43.178 --> 39:44.381
Sarah please.

39:45.514 --> 39:47.850
Perhaps you interact
with it when you take DMT.

39:47.883 --> 39:49.952
I mean, DMT penetrates
these very, very

39:49.985 --> 39:51.121
primitive parts of our brains

39:51.153 --> 39:55.057
and it perhaps allows you
to perceive other dimensions

39:55.325 --> 39:58.195
and maybe something in
Sky drew this being to her

39:58.227 --> 40:00.130
and through her,
it crossed over.

40:00.162 --> 40:01.264
Stop.

40:01.296 --> 40:02.465
'Cause this is
some teenage girls

40:02.497 --> 40:04.066
psycho sexual fantasy.

40:05.168 --> 40:07.903
Symptomatic of a severe
clinical psychosis

40:07.936 --> 40:08.971
obviously related to her father.

40:09.005 --> 40:11.541
I know that that is
the rational explanation.

40:12.075 --> 40:13.843
So, this guy she's with

40:13.876 --> 40:15.012
is killed

40:16.079 --> 40:19.515
while Sky is only attacked
by the same being.

40:19.548 --> 40:21.083
I know. I know all of this.

40:23.218 --> 40:26.088
I just wonder if what
we're dealing with here

40:26.122 --> 40:29.025
is something else,
something that cannot be

40:29.057 --> 40:32.228
explained through
behavioral science.

40:32.262 --> 40:34.898
Okay, so maybe DMT
will open the mind to

40:34.930 --> 40:37.333
other planes of existence,

40:38.034 --> 40:40.470
which is why she was able to
see this malevolent being,

40:40.503 --> 40:42.972
but that still only
exists in her mind.

40:44.407 --> 40:45.976
I saw it too.

40:48.043 --> 40:49.045
What?

40:49.311 --> 40:50.947
I saw it.

40:52.048 --> 40:54.618
Sarah, that's some sort
of electrical interference.

40:57.419 --> 40:59.188
Look, don't do this to yourself.

40:59.222 --> 41:00.557
What?

41:00.590 --> 41:01.358
Well,
you're taking on Sky's

41:01.390 --> 41:02.592
delusional beliefs.

41:02.624 --> 41:03.994
No. I'm not.

41:04.026 --> 41:06.061
When I was at the
lake house, I saw this

41:06.095 --> 41:07.930
black shape

41:09.999 --> 41:11.201
and then this happened.

41:13.568 --> 41:14.938
It cannot be an
allergic reaction

41:14.970 --> 41:17.240
because I've never
taken DMT before.

41:19.242 --> 41:22.245
Well, there's some sort
of contamination there.

41:22.278 --> 41:24.514
A bacteria infection
from the lake.

41:30.253 --> 41:31.555
I hope you're right.

41:31.954 --> 41:32.989
I know I am.

41:34.157 --> 41:36.059
Look Sarah, I need to know that

41:36.092 --> 41:38.160
this is not going to affect you.

41:39.195 --> 41:40.162
Okay?

41:41.264 --> 41:42.999
I need you to be strong.

41:45.168 --> 41:46.403
Of course.

44:35.171 --> 44:38.442
I went to see your lecturer
yesterday, Matthew.

44:40.776 --> 44:42.546
You had an affair
with him, didn't you?

44:44.780 --> 44:45.816
He told you that?

44:46.816 --> 44:48.318
No, he didn't have to.

44:52.755 --> 44:54.724
What else didn't he tell you?

44:59.227 --> 45:01.298
Sky, I'd like to
tell you a story.

45:03.231 --> 45:06.602
It's about a little girl
who had an imaginary friend

45:06.635 --> 45:10.673
like yours, only he was a boy.

45:11.240 --> 45:13.142
A little boy called Sebastian.

45:15.845 --> 45:17.180
Let me guess.

45:18.180 --> 45:19.883
Is the girl's name Sarah?

45:21.184 --> 45:22.119
Yes.

45:24.452 --> 45:25.855
What happened to her?

45:27.657 --> 45:29.892
One day, we were
on our way to school.

45:29.925 --> 45:32.895
We went together every
day and caught the bus.

45:34.197 --> 45:37.300
On this day, he stopped
to drop his shoe laces

45:37.532 --> 45:39.201
and I got on the bus before him

45:39.235 --> 45:41.336
and the door was shut behind me

45:41.369 --> 45:43.205
and Sebastian couldn't get on.

45:44.307 --> 45:46.609
I cried out to the bus
driver to open the doors

45:46.642 --> 45:48.845
but he looked around, he
couldn't see anyone there,

45:48.878 --> 45:51.213
so he just drove off.

45:52.847 --> 45:54.650
I ran to the back of the bus

45:55.483 --> 45:56.852
and the last I ever
saw of Sebastian

45:56.885 --> 46:00.923
was this little boy with
this big floppy hat,

46:00.956 --> 46:02.725
his big backpack on his back

46:04.894 --> 46:09.232
just all alone waiting
for the next bus.

46:17.372 --> 46:18.641
That's sad.

46:22.010 --> 46:24.346
I lost my father too.

46:26.381 --> 46:28.918
He just disappeared one
day without saying goodbye.

46:33.488 --> 46:36.226
But that's not why
I lost Sebastian.

46:38.360 --> 46:40.829
He disappeared because
eventually, I grew up.

46:45.668 --> 46:46.903
I see what you're doing.

46:49.572 --> 46:51.006
I know that I can't blame my Dad

46:51.039 --> 46:52.875
for what happened to Emily.

46:56.012 --> 46:58.247
But I can for what
happened to my Mom.

47:18.434 --> 47:19.903
It's not in my head.

47:23.338 --> 47:24.373
It's real.

47:27.309 --> 47:28.477
It comes to me.

47:29.912 --> 47:31.348
It's darkness.

47:35.885 --> 47:37.954
I made contact with something

47:39.954 --> 47:42.258
and now it's come into my world.

47:48.631 --> 47:50.300
Do you understand?

47:51.633 --> 47:54.938
No you don't. No you don't.

48:12.722 --> 48:14.024
You won't leave me.

48:15.523 --> 48:16.592
Will you?

48:19.461 --> 48:20.697
No I won't.

50:45.974 --> 50:48.777
It is now a
life and death struggle.

50:49.811 --> 50:53.015
For the victorious
male, the right to mate.

50:53.816 --> 50:57.119
For the loser, a
slow agonizing death.

51:13.102 --> 51:14.838
You shouldn't be here.

51:17.106 --> 51:19.108
I need to know
what's going on.

51:22.010 --> 51:22.978
Dear.

51:24.012 --> 51:25.848
What happened to you?

51:27.282 --> 51:28.584
It's okay.

51:31.019 --> 51:32.488
It's okay.

51:36.224 --> 51:37.259
It's okay.

51:46.735 --> 51:47.704
Hello?

51:50.139 --> 51:51.006
Okay.

51:52.974 --> 51:54.510
Okay, where are you?

52:14.729 --> 52:15.998
She's on her way.

52:17.967 --> 52:19.702
You have to go back, Sky.

52:20.235 --> 52:21.671
No.

52:23.738 --> 52:26.008
Not until you tell me
what's happening to me.

52:28.977 --> 52:30.213
Well, there's no formula.

52:33.182 --> 52:34.984
It's different for each person.

52:35.784 --> 52:38.021
Depends what's in
here and in here.

52:39.088 --> 52:41.823
No two people are gonna
have the same experience.

52:44.126 --> 52:45.695
Where did you get it?

52:46.160 --> 52:47.563
It doesn't matter.

52:50.965 --> 52:52.300
You tell the police about us?

52:56.171 --> 52:58.174
Jeremy's missing, okay?

53:01.376 --> 53:02.978
I don't wanna talk about us.

53:07.950 --> 53:10.119
I don't know what's real

53:10.753 --> 53:12.622
and what's not any more.

53:15.390 --> 53:17.026
Is that what happened to you?

53:18.026 --> 53:19.227
For a while.

53:20.896 --> 53:22.631
I've always had a fairly
casual relationship

53:22.664 --> 53:24.099
with reality.

53:28.970 --> 53:29.805
Hey.

53:34.242 --> 53:35.777
Think about it

53:37.012 --> 53:39.082
like going to another dimension,

53:39.847 --> 53:41.784
one that you can't usually see.

53:43.785 --> 53:45.153
Is there something else there?

53:46.421 --> 53:47.823
You can tell me.

53:48.956 --> 53:50.258
Was there something else there?

53:51.894 --> 53:52.794
Yeah.

53:52.827 --> 53:54.096
Did it make contact with you?

53:56.432 --> 54:01.638
Whatever it was, it only
exists in your mind.

54:04.439 --> 54:05.340
No.

54:06.809 --> 54:07.910
This is real.

54:15.084 --> 54:16.886
Sarah sees it too.

54:17.985 --> 54:19.320
Sarah.

54:23.325 --> 54:24.694
You okay?

54:27.796 --> 54:29.966
I thought there
was something there.

54:30.264 --> 54:31.667
There's nothing there.

54:32.166 --> 54:33.201
It's just the...

54:33.968 --> 54:35.838
it's just the chemistry
of your brain.

54:36.472 --> 54:37.273
No.

54:38.072 --> 54:39.340
It's okay. It's okay.

54:39.374 --> 54:41.110
Listen, it's just your mind

54:41.142 --> 54:44.012
trying to make sense of
the experience, okay?

54:44.046 --> 54:45.181
Just needs to pass.

54:45.213 --> 54:46.882
Let it pass through you.

54:47.983 --> 54:49.385
Let it pass through you.

54:59.762 --> 55:00.697
What are you doing?

55:09.104 --> 55:09.972
Come on.

55:15.410 --> 55:16.479
Stop!

55:18.313 --> 55:19.881
I'm not gonna hurt you.

55:21.115 --> 55:22.418
No one's gonna hurt you.

56:29.918 --> 56:30.887
Matt?

56:34.990 --> 56:36.025
Sky?

56:40.461 --> 56:41.429
Sky?

56:46.901 --> 56:49.472
Sky. You alright?

56:52.106 --> 56:53.809
Hey. You're okay.

56:54.175 --> 56:56.044
Listen, there's a blackout.

56:56.077 --> 56:58.146
Okay? From the storm.

56:58.180 --> 56:59.415
Everything's fine.

57:00.883 --> 57:01.584
See?

57:37.418 --> 57:39.020
Where are you taking her?

57:41.490 --> 57:43.192
Where are you taking her?

57:43.392 --> 57:45.294
Look, she needs to be with me.

57:47.028 --> 57:49.297
Wrong. She's ours now.

58:06.014 --> 58:07.216
There's no body.

58:08.983 --> 58:11.219
There's blood everywhere
but there's no body.

58:13.956 --> 58:15.191
Are you okay?

58:16.358 --> 58:19.394
You know, you think you've
got everything worked out.

58:20.561 --> 58:21.930
That you've got
everything under control

58:21.963 --> 58:24.032
and then something
like this happens.

58:27.269 --> 58:28.169
Yeah.

58:28.202 --> 58:30.171
Nothing feels real any more.

58:33.675 --> 58:36.544
Police. Did they
take your statement?

58:37.412 --> 58:38.547
Yes.

58:42.017 --> 58:44.153
You should go home. Rest up.

58:44.452 --> 58:45.655
You look exhausted.

58:49.758 --> 58:51.093
You're taking me off her case.

58:51.126 --> 58:52.128
Yes I am.

58:53.095 --> 58:54.096
I thought you were on my side.

58:54.128 --> 58:55.430
I am on your side.

58:57.099 --> 58:58.367
I'm doing this for you.

59:00.135 --> 59:01.437
I can't afford to
lose you Sarah.

59:02.303 --> 59:04.173
No please.

59:04.206 --> 59:05.039
Please Nick, don't do this.

59:05.073 --> 59:08.110
Just go home and
rest up please.

59:10.077 --> 59:11.079
Please.

01:04:31.532 --> 01:04:33.001
Mind if we take a look around?

01:04:34.068 --> 01:04:35.436
Okay.

01:04:42.443 --> 01:04:44.746
Now, let's talk
about last night again.

01:04:45.914 --> 01:04:48.017
How long have you known
Matt Sorensen for?

01:04:48.816 --> 01:04:50.084
Just a few days.

01:04:55.622 --> 01:04:58.494
Yeah, sorry I gotta take this.

01:05:07.668 --> 01:05:08.970
Hello darling.

01:05:10.905 --> 01:05:12.707
Yeah, Daddy can't
talk right now.

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:13.876
Daddy's at work.

01:05:19.814 --> 01:05:22.651
Yes, I'll be home soon.

01:05:24.718 --> 01:05:26.387
Well why don't you
play with your friend?

01:05:30.492 --> 01:05:32.026
Okay, I will.

01:05:36.597 --> 01:05:38.032
Yes, I promise.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.002
Alright, Daddy's
gotta go now darling.

01:05:41.035 --> 01:05:42.638
I'll see you soon.

01:05:43.003 --> 01:05:44.539
Bye bye sweetheart.

01:05:47.041 --> 01:05:48.943
Hey, what are you doing?

01:05:52.646 --> 01:05:54.549
I have these marks.

01:05:54.849 --> 01:05:57.119
I have them all over my body.

01:05:57.151 --> 01:05:58.787
Okay, let us see.

01:06:03.023 --> 01:06:04.392
I have them all here.

01:06:07.028 --> 01:06:09.131
You know, if I
was a psychologist,

01:06:09.997 --> 01:06:13.001
I'd say you're unconsciously
trying to confess to us.

01:06:13.434 --> 01:06:14.369
What do you mean?

01:06:15.436 --> 01:06:17.038
You admit what you did.

01:06:17.939 --> 01:06:19.141
What I did?

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:20.909
We know that you were
with Jeremy Winters

01:06:20.941 --> 01:06:22.610
the night that he disappeared

01:06:22.943 --> 01:06:23.811
and last night, you
snuck out the clinic

01:06:23.845 --> 01:06:26.115
and paid a little
visit to Matt Sorensen

01:06:26.514 --> 01:06:28.784
and the only thing left of
him now is a pool of blood.

01:06:29.684 --> 01:06:31.686
Sky Williams, we're
formally charging you

01:06:31.718 --> 01:06:33.988
with the murders of Matt
Sorensen and Jeremy Winters.

01:06:34.021 --> 01:06:36.090
Hang on, hang on, what
did you just call me?

01:06:36.724 --> 01:06:37.959
Sky Williams.

01:06:37.992 --> 01:06:39.995
No, you're confused.
I'm not Sky Williams.

01:06:40.028 --> 01:06:41.129
I'm Sarah Faithforth.

01:06:41.162 --> 01:06:43.064
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:06:43.097 --> 01:06:43.965
No, I'm Sarah Faithforth.

01:06:43.997 --> 01:06:45.733
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:06:45.767 --> 01:06:47.403
I'm Sarah Faithforth.

01:06:48.068 --> 01:06:50.738
You don't understand!
I'm Sarah Faithforth!

01:06:51.171 --> 01:06:53.007
I'm Sarah Faithforth!

01:07:22.836 --> 01:07:24.005
Hello, it's Sarah.

01:07:24.972 --> 01:07:26.608
Is Doctor Trangrove there?

01:07:28.276 --> 01:07:29.178
What?

01:07:30.945 --> 01:07:32.713
Where have they taken her?

01:08:05.146 --> 01:08:06.948
Do that a couple times for me.

01:08:16.691 --> 01:08:18.693
Sky, we need to know the truth.

01:08:19.326 --> 01:08:20.795
You need to know.

01:08:22.263 --> 01:08:23.899
You can't kill them.

01:08:28.068 --> 01:08:29.837
We're just gonna
give you a small dose.

01:08:30.871 --> 01:08:33.274
It'll just help you
remember, that's all.

01:08:33.741 --> 01:08:35.210
I don't want to remember.

01:08:38.645 --> 01:08:41.983
Sky, you have to do this.

01:08:43.817 --> 01:08:47.622
Now if you don't, then we'll
know you're hiding something.

01:08:53.995 --> 01:08:55.930
Okay, no need
to be frightened.

01:08:55.964 --> 01:08:57.832
It's gonna be okay.

01:09:05.973 --> 01:09:08.274
Sky, I want you to start

01:09:08.308 --> 01:09:11.912
by telling me something
that you remember.

01:09:13.781 --> 01:09:16.018
Something you remember
about your father.

01:09:18.385 --> 01:09:20.022
I'm lying in bed.

01:09:22.889 --> 01:09:24.125
With Emily.

01:09:28.862 --> 01:09:31.299
I hear my Mom start to cry.

01:09:38.805 --> 01:09:40.041
Yelling at my Dad.

01:09:43.678 --> 01:09:44.979
He's yelling back at her.

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.156
Then it just gets quiet.

01:09:56.124 --> 01:09:57.992
Hi, you've called
Doctor Nicholas Trangrove.

01:09:58.026 --> 01:10:00.696
Please leave a message
after the beep.

01:10:01.129 --> 01:10:02.930
Nick, Nick, it's Sarah.

01:10:03.296 --> 01:10:05.099
Please be careful, okay?

01:10:05.133 --> 01:10:06.668
I know how I sound.

01:10:06.701 --> 01:10:08.870
I know that I sound
crazy, but I saw it again

01:10:08.902 --> 01:10:10.104
and it attacked me.

01:10:12.439 --> 01:10:15.943
It wants Sky and it
will destroy anything

01:10:15.977 --> 01:10:17.045
that tries to stop it.

01:10:17.077 --> 01:10:18.847
You have to believe me.

01:10:20.982 --> 01:10:22.250
Tell
me about Emily.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.656
She's telling me to be strong.

01:10:33.393 --> 01:10:36.097
And she'll always
be here with me.

01:10:43.004 --> 01:10:45.173
And then she got taken away.

01:10:47.174 --> 01:10:48.943
Is that why you killed Jeremy?

01:10:50.812 --> 01:10:52.381
I didn't kill Jeremy.

01:10:55.015 --> 01:10:56.718
Well you must have Sky.

01:10:57.218 --> 01:10:59.821
'Cause there was no one
else here at that time.

01:11:00.888 --> 01:11:02.024
There was.

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:08.263
Sky, that's just a
figment of your imagination

01:11:08.295 --> 01:11:09.865
just like Emily.

01:11:11.098 --> 01:11:12.333
Not to me.

01:11:14.268 --> 01:11:15.404
It branded me

01:11:18.205 --> 01:11:20.708
like a master brands his slave.

01:11:21.041 --> 01:11:22.910
It's just a hallucination.

01:11:23.911 --> 01:11:25.047
It doesn't exist.

01:11:26.113 --> 01:11:27.115
You're right.

01:11:34.088 --> 01:11:36.157
What if it's right here with us?

01:11:37.759 --> 01:11:39.027
Well, where is it?

01:11:40.495 --> 01:11:41.963
I can't see it.

01:11:44.064 --> 01:11:46.468
I can't see it because
it doesn't exist.

01:11:48.302 --> 01:11:49.371
Where is it?

01:11:55.009 --> 01:11:56.878
It's right behind you.

01:12:09.055 --> 01:12:11.125
Sky, there's nothing there.

01:12:12.559 --> 01:12:13.928
I'll show you.

01:12:57.071 --> 01:12:58.240
You stay right there.

01:14:25.092 --> 01:14:27.128
Get away from her!

01:14:28.963 --> 01:14:30.130
Stay back!

01:14:31.665 --> 01:14:33.067
Get out!

01:14:34.701 --> 01:14:36.003
Listen to me.

01:14:37.004 --> 01:14:38.607
Listen to what I'm saying.

01:14:39.173 --> 01:14:42.344
You don't need Sarah any more.

01:14:43.311 --> 01:14:45.080
Let her go.

01:14:59.527 --> 01:15:00.595
Who are you?

01:15:01.195 --> 01:15:02.229
It's alright.

01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:04.531
You're alright.

01:15:07.168 --> 01:15:08.370
Where's Sky?

01:15:09.036 --> 01:15:12.173
It's
okay. You're okay.

01:15:12.505 --> 01:15:13.642
Where's...

01:15:18.112 --> 01:15:20.248
Sky! Sky!

01:15:24.184 --> 01:15:24.986
It's Doctor Rosenthall.

01:15:25.553 --> 01:15:27.354
I need someone over
here right now.

01:15:30.156 --> 01:15:31.092
Sky.

01:15:42.169 --> 01:15:43.470
What have you done with her?

01:17:46.393 --> 01:17:49.330
That's right. It's you.

01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:52.199
Where's Sky?

01:17:53.134 --> 01:17:54.502
Where's Sky?

01:17:55.536 --> 01:17:57.238
You don't understand.

01:17:57.771 --> 01:17:59.840
I have to protect her.

01:18:01.474 --> 01:18:02.811
Where is she?

01:18:03.643 --> 01:18:04.611
Okay.

01:18:17.525 --> 01:18:19.227
Who do you see?

01:18:24.464 --> 01:18:25.833
I see myself.

01:18:35.808 --> 01:18:37.344
I was with her

01:18:37.945 --> 01:18:39.447
at the lake house.

01:18:40.613 --> 01:18:42.784
She went there with
Doctor Trangrove.

01:18:49.723 --> 01:18:50.892
Did something happen?

01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:55.362
Is that why I'm here?

01:18:56.563 --> 01:18:58.133
Try to remember.

01:19:11.911 --> 01:19:13.280
No.

01:19:39.473 --> 01:19:40.575
He's dead.

01:19:45.612 --> 01:19:47.548
So are the two police officers.

01:19:52.286 --> 01:19:53.488
And Matt.

01:19:57.424 --> 01:19:58.426
And Jeremy.

01:20:00.361 --> 01:20:01.595
You know.

01:20:04.497 --> 01:20:05.500
No.

01:20:08.035 --> 01:20:09.670
No.

01:20:09.702 --> 01:20:11.438
You didn't
know what you were doing.

01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:15.242
I didn't do anything.

01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:16.876
Listen to me.

01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:18.946
Sky didn't do anything.

01:20:18.978 --> 01:20:22.249
This is a huge misunderstanding.

01:20:22.816 --> 01:20:23.952
Listen to me.

01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:28.889
The darkness.

01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:31.358
This is darkness.

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:36.531
It's consuming all of
us. Do you understand?

01:20:37.363 --> 01:20:39.500
It's consuming all of us.

01:20:42.936 --> 01:20:44.371
Why am I here?

01:20:45.472 --> 01:20:47.742
You are in McPherson House.

01:20:48.008 --> 01:20:49.876
It's a medium security unit

01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:52.313
of Springbrook
Psychiatric Hospital.

01:20:53.379 --> 01:20:57.751
You've been here under a
custodial supervision order

01:20:57.951 --> 01:20:59.587
for the last 10 years.

01:21:01.354 --> 01:21:02.290
No.

01:21:06.794 --> 01:21:07.996
You stay away from me.

01:21:08.961 --> 01:21:12.032
You stay away from me.

01:21:12.066 --> 01:21:13.800
Listen to me.
You don't understand.

01:21:13.834 --> 01:21:15.436
I need to find Sky.

01:21:15.469 --> 01:21:16.637
I need to find Sky!

01:21:16.670 --> 01:21:19.640
So close, Sky.
You're almost there.

01:21:19.673 --> 01:21:21.409
Please!
You don't understand!

01:21:21.442 --> 01:21:23.444
You don't understand.
Please!

01:21:23.477 --> 01:21:24.945
This will take you
the rest of the way.

01:21:24.978 --> 01:21:27.882
Don't! No!
Don't touch me!

01:21:27.915 --> 01:21:29.984
Don't touch me.

01:21:47.668 --> 01:21:49.370
Sky, listen to me.

01:21:49.635 --> 01:21:51.339
Listen to what I'm saying.

01:21:54.607 --> 01:21:57.010
The dimethyltryptamine
caused a split

01:21:57.044 --> 01:21:59.380
in the way you perceive reality.

01:22:01.848 --> 01:22:03.750
What's going on in your head

01:22:03.784 --> 01:22:06.053
is completely different
from what's going on

01:22:06.085 --> 01:22:07.821
in the real world.

01:22:09.622 --> 01:22:13.928
You think you're Sarah
Faithforth, but you're not.

01:22:15.562 --> 01:22:18.032
You're Sky Williams.

01:22:19.532 --> 01:22:22.836
Sky! Come on!

01:22:23.536 --> 01:22:24.705
Come on!

01:22:26.039 --> 01:22:26.907
You need me.
Come on!

01:22:26.939 --> 01:22:29.610
Do not let her take
me away from you.

01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:35.849
I'm sorry.

01:22:37.918 --> 01:22:39.353
I can't help it.

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:41.788
What?

01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:46.561
I don't believe
in you any more.

01:22:47.995 --> 01:22:48.930
Sky.

01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:15.589
Seven, six, five,

01:23:16.055 --> 01:23:18.860
four, three,

01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:22.997
two, one.

01:24:00.567 --> 01:24:01.969
When you were 18,

01:24:02.902 --> 01:24:06.206
you suffered a complete
psychological breakdown

01:24:07.139 --> 01:24:08.976
triggered by the drug you took.

01:24:10.210 --> 01:24:12.780
You believed you
were being attacked.

01:24:13.213 --> 01:24:16.017
So you created Sarah,

01:24:17.518 --> 01:24:22.490
someone to believe in
you, to protect you.

01:24:52.952 --> 01:24:53.888
Sky?

01:24:57.857 --> 01:24:59.526
I'm not Sky.
