01:47.482 --> 01:49.162
He seemed a little uneven.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.570
He's more uneven sometimes than others.

01:51.637 --> 01:53.598
That's what makes him uneven, of course.

01:53.634 --> 01:56.387
Now you on the other hand,
with coaching, you could be terrific.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.076
Do you really think so?

01:58.160 --> 02:01.413
- Yes, you have a definite nose.
- I'm glad you like it.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.207
Do you like any of the rest of me?

02:03.290 --> 02:06.043
Oh, what I meant was
in the card playing...

02:06.126 --> 02:09.588
I know what you meant. I
was just flirting with you...

02:36.667 --> 02:38.795
Hey, there. Want some of that?

03:06.906 --> 03:08.241
Come on up, all right.

03:15.498 --> 03:16.958
Faint, are you?

03:18.042 --> 03:21.170
- That perfume.
- Oh.

03:23.464 --> 03:26.509
Do you think they're...
any place on board?

03:28.386 --> 03:30.513
Don't you think we ought to go to bed?

03:56.914 --> 03:58.624
I'll be up soon.

04:13.723 --> 04:15.850
You know you can't
just leave like that.

04:20.855 --> 04:21.939
Okay.

04:24.734 --> 04:26.110
All this, um...

04:26.694 --> 04:29.947
this behavior, it's just
not the adult thing to do.

04:31.449 --> 04:34.202
And you're suddenly the judge
of what being an adult is?

04:34.285 --> 04:36.120
Hey, seriously,
I'm done arguing with you...

04:36.204 --> 04:39.040
No, okay, let's not, I'm...

04:43.836 --> 04:46.172
It was just bad timing. I...

04:46.255 --> 04:48.633
I had a patient emergency. I...

04:51.594 --> 04:53.680
Even if we are not good...

04:55.598 --> 05:00.228
I want...
I need to know that you are okay.

05:00.895 --> 05:02.397
I was really worried.

05:02.772 --> 05:04.482
I know, I'm sorry.

05:14.241 --> 05:18.537
- I want us to be okay.
- We are.

05:21.708 --> 05:24.419
I know that birthday party
was a fucking nightmare for you.

05:24.502 --> 05:27.296
- And I didn't mean to...
- No, you weren't.

07:15.446 --> 07:16.447
What can I get you?

07:16.531 --> 07:18.658
Uh, Americano, please.

07:18.741 --> 07:20.075
- Name?
- Diane.

07:21.536 --> 07:22.704
I got this.

07:26.165 --> 07:28.584
- You're becoming an addict.
- Really?

07:28.668 --> 07:31.504
- And you're the authority?
- Maybe.

07:33.714 --> 07:34.955
Are you really here for coffee?

07:35.633 --> 07:38.636
Maybe. It's on my way to work.

07:38.719 --> 07:41.013
God, I can barely get a compliment.

07:41.597 --> 07:42.932
You like a challenge, right?

07:43.266 --> 07:45.935
- How do you know?
- Intuition.

07:47.686 --> 07:48.686
Come here.

07:57.238 --> 07:59.115
I really should get going.

07:59.198 --> 08:02.326
Where are you always off to?
It's so mysterious.

08:02.409 --> 08:05.412
Just chill, you only
live once, you know?

08:06.122 --> 08:09.208
Yeah, I'm reminded of that a lot.

08:11.210 --> 08:13.963
- How old are you?
- What?

08:14.380 --> 08:18.842
Well, for all I know,
you could be like 38 or 40.

08:18.926 --> 08:21.679
- Or 45?
- Now you know how to give a compliment.

08:21.763 --> 08:23.681
Let's just say I'm older than you.

08:25.683 --> 08:26.768
That's good.

08:28.018 --> 08:30.354
I've always had a thing for older women.

08:32.231 --> 08:35.693
I had a serious crush on my eighth
grade social studies teacher.

08:36.110 --> 08:40.073
Like, scary shit, madly in love.

08:40.155 --> 08:44.077
Would walk past her classroom
over and over again,

08:44.159 --> 08:45.661
just to catch a glimpse.

08:46.245 --> 08:47.245
Hmm.

08:48.498 --> 08:52.502
Well, I'll wax history
for you some other time.

08:53.043 --> 08:57.506
But for now, I noticed
you didn't have one...

08:58.841 --> 09:00.009
the other night.

09:03.971 --> 09:05.556
I had a good time.

09:06.891 --> 09:08.017
Me too.

09:10.061 --> 09:11.104
I love it.

09:11.396 --> 09:15.525
- Oh, it's nothing.
- No, it's something.

09:17.068 --> 09:18.152
Thank you.

09:23.157 --> 09:24.909
I want to know about you.

09:27.537 --> 09:28.788
What do you want to know?

09:29.371 --> 09:30.371
Everything.

09:32.333 --> 09:33.668
Intense.

09:34.794 --> 09:38.423
I can be, when I like
someone or something.

09:40.591 --> 09:43.719
Easy, tiger.

09:50.184 --> 09:53.521
- I think you're quite strange.
- Really?

09:53.604 --> 09:55.732
I actually think I'm quite normal.

09:55.814 --> 09:59.276
No. People who say
they're normal never are.

09:59.777 --> 10:01.945
They're always secretly
the dysfunctional ones.

10:03.739 --> 10:06.825
It's on the house today,
you ageless creature.

10:06.909 --> 10:07.994
Thanks.

10:17.586 --> 10:21.006
No, no, that's all he said,
she moved out six weeks ago.

10:21.090 --> 10:23.843
She never said anything to me,
can you believe it?

10:23.926 --> 10:25.678
I texted her millions of times.

10:25.762 --> 10:29.640
And after thinking she was
lying dead in the gutter,

10:30.057 --> 10:32.434
she finally says she'll get back to me.

10:33.018 --> 10:34.436
She'll get back to me?

10:34.520 --> 10:37.064
And I was feeling so good
about our session.

10:37.482 --> 10:40.943
I was gonna be honest with her
and tell her the truth like you said.

10:41.027 --> 10:43.654
And then, all of a sudden,
I realized something's really wrong.

10:44.238 --> 10:48.408
It's just proof that when you feel
something is really wrong,

10:48.493 --> 10:49.327
it probably is...

10:49.410 --> 10:51.537
Okay, Claire, just take a breath here.

10:51.621 --> 10:53.748
I think you're getting
way too ahead of yourself.

10:53.831 --> 10:55.833
I know something's wrong,
and I've got the proof!

10:55.916 --> 11:00.337
Okay, but for all you know,
she just wanted a better apartment.

11:01.172 --> 11:04.842
You don't lie when you're
not doing something wrong.

11:06.594 --> 11:08.471
Rebecca texted you, though, right?

11:08.554 --> 11:09.889
So you know she's safe.

11:09.972 --> 11:11.557
I mean, she could've been abducted.

11:11.640 --> 11:13.433
Let's just stay in the present.

11:13.517 --> 11:16.520
Do you really think
that she's in that kind of trouble?

11:16.603 --> 11:18.063
I don't know what I think.

11:18.730 --> 11:22.192
I moved her into that apartment.

11:22.276 --> 11:25.530
She had broken up with this boy
that was not good enough for her.

11:25.613 --> 11:29.534
She needed me, and
that's when Howard died.

11:30.868 --> 11:33.704
And I thought maybe life
had something else in store.

11:34.914 --> 11:36.999
Maybe he was taken from me.

11:38.835 --> 11:41.671
I have Rebecca, I had hope.

11:42.296 --> 11:44.716
I can't believe she's
shut me out like this.

11:44.799 --> 11:47.218
It's okay, Claire, it's okay.

11:48.344 --> 11:50.722
- Okay.
- We'll fix it.

12:02.942 --> 12:06.487
- Hi, Diane, you're back.
- Yeah, I was just in the area.

12:06.904 --> 12:09.406
I was wondering if you could fit me in
for a blowout.

12:10.074 --> 12:11.784
- Let me check the schedule.
- Okay.

12:11.867 --> 12:14.620
I could fit you in, in about
an hour with Jessica?

12:15.288 --> 12:16.914
Great, thanks.

12:38.144 --> 12:41.397
Hi, good to see you. Rebecca Rogers.

12:41.481 --> 12:42.648
Yes.

12:43.441 --> 12:44.484
Oh, hey!

12:47.527 --> 12:48.904
- Diane, right?
- Yeah.

12:49.489 --> 12:51.157
It's nice to see you again.

12:51.740 --> 12:54.660
It's the one thing I do
for myself these days.

12:55.703 --> 12:57.663
Can I switch my appointment, too?

12:57.747 --> 13:02.293
Yes, you moved it later,
and I have you down for Monday.

13:02.376 --> 13:03.543
- Okay?
- Thank you.

13:07.131 --> 13:08.841
But that's so far.

13:08.925 --> 13:14.097
I was afraid of the distance,
but, you know, it is not that bad.

13:14.179 --> 13:17.599
And it feels nice to be out
of the congestion.

13:17.683 --> 13:18.809
So, that was it?

13:18.892 --> 13:21.728
That feeling of entrapment,
that prompted the move?

13:23.147 --> 13:25.274
It's a little unorthodox.

13:25.733 --> 13:27.443
- What?
- My situation.

13:27.526 --> 13:29.319
Don't tell me you're living
in some brothel.

13:29.404 --> 13:30.321
No.

13:30.405 --> 13:32.365
I mean, seriously,
it's nothing dangerous, is it?

13:32.447 --> 13:35.575
No, no. It is this group,

13:36.035 --> 13:39.747
and we cook together
and spend time together,

13:39.831 --> 13:41.582
and you know, I don't, um...

13:41.666 --> 13:43.042
I don't have a partner.

13:43.625 --> 13:45.127
And I was... I was just...

13:45.920 --> 13:47.880
pretty miserable before.

13:48.923 --> 13:50.550
Before this place?

13:50.633 --> 13:53.845
Yeah, I mean,
I was living according to rules

13:53.927 --> 13:56.346
that I didn't necessarily agree with.

13:58.599 --> 14:01.227
Well, you seem so at peace.

14:02.269 --> 14:04.730
I am... I'm really happy.

14:06.357 --> 14:08.651
Can I ask what your family thinks of it?

14:08.735 --> 14:10.862
I just remember you mentioning...

14:10.945 --> 14:14.073
that they were
kind of like mine, judgmental.

14:14.614 --> 14:18.452
I actually haven't told them. My mom
would literally have me committed.

14:18.535 --> 14:20.120
- No, she wouldn't...
- I'm not kidding.

14:20.746 --> 14:22.581
Her love knows no bounds.

14:23.166 --> 14:24.625
Who knows? Maybe...

14:24.709 --> 14:28.796
maybe one day she'll surprise you.
Maybe she's grown.

14:28.880 --> 14:31.299
You clearly don't know my mother.

14:31.382 --> 14:32.717
Speak of the devil.

14:33.426 --> 14:35.219
She's called me eight times today.

14:38.431 --> 14:40.433
- Pick up.
- No.

14:41.183 --> 14:43.560
Come on, it'll make her day.

14:43.643 --> 14:45.520
Fine.

14:47.398 --> 14:48.398
Hi, Mom.

14:49.275 --> 14:50.651
I'm at the salon.

14:51.527 --> 14:52.945
Yes, I have time for that.

14:53.029 --> 14:54.906
I told you that I would get back to you.

14:54.988 --> 14:57.199
I'm sorry, I know that must
have been very hard for you,

14:57.282 --> 15:00.786
but you cannot call me eight times
in one day, that's too much.

15:01.703 --> 15:02.703
Okay.

15:05.166 --> 15:06.167
Okay.

15:07.292 --> 15:10.170
Well, she told me
she's working hard in therapy.

15:10.254 --> 15:11.964
I'm not sure she's treatable, but...

15:12.882 --> 15:15.176
Well, doing the work...

15:15.802 --> 15:17.470
it's the first step, right?

15:19.430 --> 15:20.807
Try to be forgiving.

15:26.729 --> 15:28.648
You're right.

15:30.441 --> 15:31.441
Thanks.

15:35.238 --> 15:38.116
Hey, if you ever want
to come check out the space,

15:38.199 --> 15:39.534
I think that you should.

15:40.367 --> 15:42.744
We often have people
come over for dinner.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.998
Well, I'm certainly curious.

15:46.791 --> 15:48.351
Let me just give you my info.

16:10.940 --> 16:14.068
- You know you can't park here.
- Go fuck yourself.

16:18.823 --> 16:19.907
Hey, sweetie.

16:23.118 --> 16:23.827
You're late.

16:23.852 --> 16:25.978
Yeah, sorry, I was...
Let's go, sweetie.

16:27.706 --> 16:29.666
- Bye, Sadie.
- Bye.

16:32.170 --> 16:33.296
Figure that out.

16:35.923 --> 16:36.923
Come on.

16:39.677 --> 16:40.677
Mommy?

16:40.720 --> 16:43.806
I don't ever want to grow up
and be like Michelle.

16:43.890 --> 16:46.768
Oh, honey, I can assure
you, you never will.

16:47.185 --> 16:50.688
Not in one million years.
But thanks for saying that.

16:52.648 --> 16:55.151
- Want to go get ice cream?
- Yeah!

16:58.321 --> 16:59.238
Daddy!

16:59.322 --> 17:01.074
- Hey, yeah.
- Hey!

17:01.157 --> 17:03.910
Ah, s'up, my little monster?

17:03.993 --> 17:05.578
What are you doing home so early?

17:07.789 --> 17:09.443
Um, I had to go over these tapes again,

17:09.454 --> 17:11.291
and I couldn't concentrate
at the office.

17:11.376 --> 17:13.836
Ah, so this is your detective work?

17:13.920 --> 17:15.755
Internal investigation.

17:15.838 --> 17:19.300
You know, maybe your
Nancy Drew obsession will come in handy.

17:19.384 --> 17:20.384
Tell me.

17:20.926 --> 17:24.097
Hey, you. Upstairs, please.

17:26.973 --> 17:28.184
Then movie?

17:29.143 --> 17:31.062
Maybe after, okay.

17:36.067 --> 17:40.113
So, I had a run-in
with Michelle today at school.

17:40.697 --> 17:42.532
She told me to figure it out.

17:43.116 --> 17:45.118
The whole Dolly, Sadie situation.

17:45.201 --> 17:46.494
Like I can control it.

17:46.577 --> 17:48.746
I'm happy to talk to her
myself at this point, really.

17:48.830 --> 17:51.457
No, it's fine, for now.

17:53.334 --> 17:57.130
- All right, explain it to me.
- Sure you want to help?

17:57.213 --> 18:00.633
- Yeah, are you kidding?
- Okay, obviously, this is confidential.

18:00.717 --> 18:03.052
- Oh, marriage clause, got it.
- All right.

18:03.134 --> 18:05.470
So these are employee interviews,

18:05.555 --> 18:07.390
and I need to figure out who's lying.

18:07.473 --> 18:10.059
And right now everybody is poised
and to the point.

18:10.435 --> 18:11.435
Hmm.

18:11.851 --> 18:16.731
Well, people lie all the time.
It's just not always that obvious.

18:17.984 --> 18:21.195
I mean, sometimes there's
just unnecessary detail,

18:21.279 --> 18:22.613
so you have to look for that.

18:23.780 --> 18:24.823
Okay, so, here.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.827
- Listen to these four statements.
- Mm-hmm.

18:29.287 --> 18:32.165
I wear argyle socks.

18:32.749 --> 18:36.002
I voted for Kerry in the '04 election.

18:36.502 --> 18:40.256
I haven't been to the
gym in three months.

18:40.840 --> 18:44.010
And I've been a vegetarian
since I was eight,

18:44.093 --> 18:46.346
after seeing The Little Mermaid.

18:46.429 --> 18:48.181
Which one is a lie?

18:48.264 --> 18:49.307
Well...

18:49.390 --> 18:51.150
I know you, and I know
you're not vegetarian.

18:51.225 --> 18:54.896
Right, but there was unnecessary
detail surrounding that fact.

18:54.979 --> 18:59.108
You're right, but we're asking them
to go into detail.

18:59.859 --> 19:01.611
Hmm. Well...

19:02.070 --> 19:04.364
You also need to look for behavior.

19:04.779 --> 19:08.033
See, when a person's flustered,
you know, they move their legs,

19:08.117 --> 19:11.454
their hands, twitching, blinking,
that kind of stuff.

19:11.537 --> 19:13.122
Those are all really important clues.

19:13.206 --> 19:16.334
But just the sight of a lawyer,
much less one asking you questions,

19:16.417 --> 19:17.627
is going to make you nervous.

19:17.709 --> 19:19.645
It's like when you go to the airport
and show 'em your ID,

19:19.669 --> 19:21.963
and immediately I feel guilty.

19:22.547 --> 19:24.799
I don't know, it's hard
to work off a tape.

19:24.883 --> 19:27.552
It's much better
to get the feeling in the room.

19:28.221 --> 19:29.931
Can you tell when your
patients are lying?

19:30.932 --> 19:34.560
Sometimes, but it's tricky,
especially if the person's calculated

19:34.644 --> 19:38.272
or starts to believe the
delusion or lie themselves.

19:38.356 --> 19:40.608
Oh, fuck. I don't know how you do it.

19:46.989 --> 19:48.658
You got your hair done again.

19:48.741 --> 19:50.201
Oh, is it too much?

19:52.286 --> 19:54.205
It looks really good. Looks really good.

19:54.288 --> 19:56.457
Now you're telling lies.

19:57.375 --> 19:59.752
You're not as good
at reading people as you think.

19:59.836 --> 20:01.587
Oh, okay, maybe.

20:02.629 --> 20:04.830
Did you really have a patient
emergency the other night?

20:05.133 --> 20:06.133
What?

20:07.343 --> 20:08.428
Yeah, of course.

20:09.095 --> 20:10.096
Where'd you go?

20:11.054 --> 20:12.138
The West Village.

20:13.516 --> 20:14.809
We met at a café.

20:15.101 --> 20:19.105
- At that hour?
- Yeah, it's open till, like, ten-ish.

20:19.647 --> 20:21.649
They serve beer and wine at night.

20:22.942 --> 20:24.777
And amazing coffee.

20:25.153 --> 20:26.154
What's it called?

20:27.447 --> 20:29.157
The... the Rabbit Hole.

20:32.869 --> 20:33.869
Cool.

20:37.206 --> 20:38.291
That's good.

20:39.125 --> 20:41.919
You could really make
someone nervous by writing.

20:44.881 --> 20:48.718
And not responding,
that could really throw someone off.

20:53.639 --> 20:55.892
See, if my leg started shaking...

20:56.766 --> 20:58.226
you'd think I was guilty.

21:13.783 --> 21:17.162
If you only had more secrets,
I'd be so on to you.

21:18.331 --> 21:20.416
I could totally crack you.

21:25.588 --> 21:28.508
- I'm gonna check on Doll.
- Okay.

22:39.162 --> 22:43.916
Stay the fuck away from me.

23:15.573 --> 23:16.699
Hey...

23:18.117 --> 23:21.079
Hey, you're talking in your sleep.
Are you okay?

23:21.704 --> 23:25.249
Yeah, I'm sorry I woke you.

23:27.917 --> 23:29.377
It's okay.

23:59.492 --> 24:01.619
- Hey, Sam.
- Oh, hey.

24:01.701 --> 24:04.621
- I've actually been excited to see you.
- That's always good to hear.

24:05.873 --> 24:07.917
So, what's the good news?

24:11.546 --> 24:12.922
Sidney called.

24:13.588 --> 24:17.133
Well, she texted first,
but we had a really good conversation.

24:17.717 --> 24:20.011
- Oh, yeah?
- She wants to see me.

24:20.096 --> 24:21.973
And she suggested Café Clooney,

24:22.055 --> 24:24.265
which is where we had one
of our first dates.

24:24.474 --> 24:25.725
What do you think she wants?

24:26.309 --> 24:28.937
She's done some soul-searching.

24:30.063 --> 24:31.439
Said she had a lot on her mind.

24:32.025 --> 24:33.192
When was this?

24:34.193 --> 24:36.112
Last weekend, Sunday.

24:39.157 --> 24:40.158
Why?

24:41.199 --> 24:42.951
Nothing. Sorry, go on.

24:43.536 --> 24:45.163
I get the feeling you're disappointed.

24:46.079 --> 24:49.666
- Why do you think that?
- Uh, you seem it.

24:50.918 --> 24:54.505
Well, I'm just playing out
the whole story here.

24:55.256 --> 24:58.926
I mean, what about our
contract, all our progress?

24:59.010 --> 25:01.137
Look, I get it, but I'm
doing really well.

25:01.220 --> 25:03.514
Yeah... without Sidney.

25:03.596 --> 25:05.723
But I can't pretend that part
of my life didn't exist.

25:06.307 --> 25:09.147
Obviously your contract worked to show
her I'm not just gonna be around.

25:09.227 --> 25:10.269
Your tactic worked.

25:10.353 --> 25:12.730
But the minute she calls,
you go running back to her?

25:12.815 --> 25:13.815
What does that suggest?

25:13.858 --> 25:16.694
And that wasn't a tactic
to lure her back in.

25:17.153 --> 25:18.488
It was to protect you.

25:21.114 --> 25:22.573
I already made up my mind.

25:23.157 --> 25:24.998
- I know it feels good.
- You don't understand.

25:25.078 --> 25:26.329
If you were in my shoes...

25:26.411 --> 25:28.579
Dinner will be great, but then what?

25:29.163 --> 25:30.644
Maybe she wants to get back together.

25:31.417 --> 25:32.710
Is that what she said?

25:34.585 --> 25:35.837
No.

25:37.215 --> 25:40.385
She said she wanted some advice,
and she knows I'm level-headed.

25:41.636 --> 25:43.805
Well, about everything except her.

25:44.764 --> 25:46.140
Play the tape, Sam.

25:46.933 --> 25:50.186
The best predictor
of future behavior is the past.

25:50.937 --> 25:53.773
I just don't want
history repeating itself here.

25:53.856 --> 25:55.942
S-so what, you think I should cancel?

25:56.025 --> 25:57.025
Can you?

25:57.402 --> 25:58.653
Do you have that restraint?

25:58.736 --> 26:00.196
Well, yeah, of course.

26:00.279 --> 26:04.283
For all you know, she could be texting
with two people, maybe more.

26:04.365 --> 26:06.617
Sidney never dates two people
at the same time.

26:06.701 --> 26:08.286
She puts all her admiration into one...

26:08.786 --> 26:10.079
till she gets bored.

26:14.043 --> 26:15.211
What about that woman?

26:16.587 --> 26:17.587
Diane?

26:20.258 --> 26:23.845
Once she reciprocates,
it'll be done. It's just a game.

26:37.108 --> 26:38.317
Take your phone out.

26:39.567 --> 26:40.567
Excuse me?

26:41.320 --> 26:44.032
I want to see if you have that ability,
to cancel.

26:44.115 --> 26:45.199
Text her.

26:46.993 --> 26:48.286
It's a good test.

26:56.250 --> 26:57.418
What do I say?

26:58.002 --> 27:01.297
Tell her something's come up,
and you can't make it.

27:03.634 --> 27:04.634
But...

27:04.675 --> 27:08.763
Trust me. Go on, Sam, be strong.

27:18.149 --> 27:20.318
It's her calling.

27:23.446 --> 27:24.489
Answer it.

27:25.530 --> 27:26.906
- Now?
- Mm-hmm.

27:29.994 --> 27:30.995
Hey, Sid.

27:32.495 --> 27:34.122
I actually can't.

27:36.124 --> 27:38.501
I'm actually with my therapist.

27:42.922 --> 27:43.922
It's a long story.

27:48.721 --> 27:50.473
She says she wants to talk to you.

27:51.432 --> 27:52.934
It's against the rules.

27:54.018 --> 27:55.561
She said it's against the rules.

27:56.896 --> 27:59.065
All right, okay, bye.

28:06.698 --> 28:07.865
What did she say?

28:09.450 --> 28:10.952
That you're a cunt.

28:15.621 --> 28:19.792
No, it was at Crate and Barrel,
of all places, shopping for a bed.

28:19.877 --> 28:20.878
It was super awkward.

28:20.962 --> 28:21.879
What'd you do?

28:21.963 --> 28:25.383
Oh, my God, I just, like,
hid under some bedroom furniture.

28:25.466 --> 28:27.051
I once saw a patient at the movies.

28:27.135 --> 28:29.262
- The movies?
- He was on a date.

28:29.345 --> 28:31.825
So I moved all the way to the back
so I wouldn't blow his spot.

28:31.889 --> 28:33.558
The worst is on the subway.

28:34.100 --> 28:35.100
It's like,

28:35.516 --> 28:38.895
how do you wave politely
and still get the fuck out of there?

28:39.478 --> 28:41.856
I'm still waiting for a patient
to become obsessed with me.

28:42.356 --> 28:45.443
You do not want that. Ask Jean.

28:47.947 --> 28:49.907
Yeah, it was a bad
situation with a patient.

28:49.991 --> 28:52.827
She became really co-dependent.

28:52.910 --> 28:54.704
- With you?
- Mm-hmm.

28:54.787 --> 28:55.913
She was obsessed.

28:57.165 --> 28:58.458
It got really bad.

29:00.168 --> 29:01.888
She ended up burning
her family's house down

29:01.961 --> 29:04.201
and blamed Jean as part
of the reason for why she did it.

29:05.296 --> 29:07.590
- That's insane.
- Yeah.

29:08.217 --> 29:09.719
It was a long time ago.

29:11.304 --> 29:14.223
You know,
classic borderline, many factors.

29:15.224 --> 29:17.810
Wow, that's scary.

29:18.436 --> 29:21.064
She is now at an
institution, thankfully.

29:23.024 --> 29:25.401
And I got on this roller coaster.

29:26.319 --> 29:28.821
I sat alone, waiting.

29:30.488 --> 29:33.741
My dad, watching in the crowd.

29:34.577 --> 29:38.498
As we went around and around,
we started to go faster.

29:38.581 --> 29:41.542
So fast that my mouth was like this.

29:42.541 --> 29:45.419
Agape, frozen in fear.

29:45.797 --> 29:51.636
It was like, for that brief moment,
all time had just stopped.

29:54.470 --> 29:57.598
I felt completely out of control,
like I couldn't see anymore,

29:57.682 --> 30:00.184
or I couldn't feel anymore.

30:04.691 --> 30:06.776
Yeah, I get that
that's the way you want to run it,

30:06.859 --> 30:09.112
but I'm not gonna compromise the truth.

30:09.737 --> 30:13.199
Okay, fine. I'll get
it to you by Tuesday.

30:14.156 --> 30:15.156
Hey.

30:16.369 --> 30:18.621
I was beginning to think
you were gonna stand me up.

30:19.036 --> 30:21.372
Sorry, I got stuck at a work thing.

30:21.457 --> 30:23.167
They fucked up my article.

30:23.668 --> 30:25.211
Right. Work.

30:26.379 --> 30:28.631
So, when am I gonna get
to read something of yours?

30:29.048 --> 30:30.383
You can read whatever you want.

30:30.965 --> 30:32.466
I can't.

30:32.885 --> 30:34.345
I don't even know your last name.

30:35.763 --> 30:38.933
If I give you too much information,
are you gonna run?

30:39.600 --> 30:42.520
- What?
- You like to fuck with people.

30:43.602 --> 30:45.396
Lure them in and kick 'em to the curb.

30:46.607 --> 30:50.111
- Does that scare you, Diane?
- Not at all.

30:50.194 --> 30:53.865
It's impressive, actually,
the power you seem to hold.

30:54.907 --> 30:59.412
But, just so you know,
I'm not gonna fall for that.

31:03.958 --> 31:06.419
- Hi.
- Chardonnay, please.

31:09.714 --> 31:11.215
You think this is a game?

31:12.592 --> 31:14.177
That I was trying to fuck with you?

31:15.968 --> 31:17.803
I just want to get to know you.

31:18.556 --> 31:23.269
I mean, it's hard to invest emotionally
when I don't even know where you live.

31:25.271 --> 31:26.397
Upper West.

31:27.065 --> 31:29.108
- What else?
- Where are you from?

31:29.192 --> 31:31.486
I grew up Upstate.

31:31.569 --> 31:33.571
Moved to Connecticut
when I was about eight.

31:34.447 --> 31:37.533
- Your parents?
- Divorced, messy.

31:37.909 --> 31:38.910
Mine, too.

31:40.078 --> 31:41.537
No siblings.

31:41.621 --> 31:45.166
Went to grad school in the city,
undergrad at Stanford.

31:45.247 --> 31:48.584
- Smart.
- No, I just studied a lot.

31:49.128 --> 31:50.421
You satisfied?

31:59.222 --> 32:00.640
We're not doing anything wrong.

32:01.849 --> 32:05.269
Nobody gives a shit, trust me.

32:07.353 --> 32:09.146
Although, you're cute
when you're nervous.

32:10.983 --> 32:12.151
It's not that.

32:13.150 --> 32:15.236
Have you ever been with a woman before?

32:21.494 --> 32:22.662
That's okay.

32:27.125 --> 32:29.252
It's just,
I'm going through a lot right now.

32:29.335 --> 32:30.837
It's hard to explain.

32:32.213 --> 32:34.382
I don't want to make your life
more difficult.

32:36.384 --> 32:38.636
This doesn't have to be complicated.

32:42.390 --> 32:43.891
Nice nails.

32:47.437 --> 32:49.939
You know why I like it? Indigo?

32:51.065 --> 32:53.192
Because it barely exists.

32:54.277 --> 32:56.237
They call it the sixth color
of the rainbow,

32:56.320 --> 33:00.366
but, really, it's just
kind of a fantasy.

33:05.038 --> 33:06.164
Shit.

33:06.748 --> 33:07.790
What?

33:07.874 --> 33:10.960
Um, I reached out to Sam the
other day, kind of randomly,

33:11.044 --> 33:13.921
and I have some of his shit
to give back to him.

33:14.005 --> 33:15.565
We're supposed to grab dinner tomorrow,

33:15.631 --> 33:17.633
but I kind of just want
to get it over with.

33:18.342 --> 33:19.469
What do you mean?

33:20.178 --> 33:21.554
Well, he lives in the area.

33:21.637 --> 33:23.765
He's just gonna come and grab his shit.

33:24.432 --> 33:26.851
I think you'll be amazed
I dated such a square.

33:27.433 --> 33:29.185
Wait, he's coming here right now?

33:29.268 --> 33:31.145
God, you look so nervous.

33:32.565 --> 33:35.902
- What are you doing?
- No, this is inappropriate.

33:35.985 --> 33:38.237
Like, insanely inappropriate.

33:38.780 --> 33:40.698
- Okay...
- Reframe it.

33:40.779 --> 33:45.409
You like me, and you're telling your
ex-boyfriend to come here right now?

33:45.870 --> 33:48.081
Think about that for a second.
It's totally fucked up.

33:48.164 --> 33:49.957
Honestly, I don't need a lecture.

34:19.821 --> 34:21.531
Allison, this is Jean.

34:21.614 --> 34:25.201
Uh, we had an appointment
15 minutes ago, actually.

34:26.077 --> 34:28.371
I'm just wondering what's going on.

34:28.746 --> 34:30.498
Can you call me back, please?

34:30.581 --> 34:36.420
We can't do this if you're not willing
to do the work or show up.

34:36.877 --> 34:38.462
Okay, thank you.

34:43.678 --> 34:46.764
Oh, hey. I didn't think
you were gonna come back in today.

34:46.844 --> 34:49.806
Yeah, I, I just wanted to
go over the HR complaints.

34:50.268 --> 34:51.268
Huh.

34:51.853 --> 34:53.646
Never seen you in glasses before.

34:53.730 --> 34:56.649
I wear contacts to work.

34:58.776 --> 35:00.236
You know, um...

35:00.653 --> 35:03.072
we're actually going
over to the Gingerman

35:03.156 --> 35:06.993
to celebrate Lee's 40th,
if you want to come.

35:08.453 --> 35:10.538
Uh, sure. Sounds like fun.

35:15.334 --> 35:19.380
- Hey, is everything okay?
- Yeah, totally.

36:07.968 --> 36:09.845
That's not what I said, Scott.

36:10.014 --> 36:11.516
We should toast you.

36:12.767 --> 36:15.395
Did you know that this one
was a writer-performer?

36:16.270 --> 36:18.272
You should do a story hour at the firm.

36:18.356 --> 36:19.732
Yeah, right.

36:19.816 --> 36:23.444
Anyway, it's not a big deal.
It's kind of like The Moth.

36:23.903 --> 36:25.196
And what is, what is that?

36:25.279 --> 36:27.448
Oh, wow, you're really out of touch.

36:27.532 --> 36:30.118
No, shit, all right? Enlighten me.

36:30.284 --> 36:33.204
It's a showcase
for storytellers to perform.

36:33.287 --> 36:35.123
Huh. And what's it about?

36:36.374 --> 36:39.627
It's just a story about my dad,
the ups and downs.

36:40.209 --> 36:41.460
Oh, were you guys close?

36:42.004 --> 36:43.798
Depends how you define close.

36:43.881 --> 36:45.591
I mean, he lived for me and my sister.

36:46.676 --> 36:49.470
I don't think I realized
how lucky I was as a kid

36:49.554 --> 36:51.764
until I got to college
and realized that...

36:52.390 --> 36:56.019
almost everybody
had a completely fucked up childhood.

36:57.184 --> 37:00.354
And all I wanna do is shelter Dolly
for a little while.

37:00.938 --> 37:02.815
She's made me completely soft.

37:02.900 --> 37:04.652
All I hear are words.

37:04.736 --> 37:06.779
That's because you're an asshole, okay?

37:06.863 --> 37:09.449
And you got two boys,
so your vote doesn't count.

37:09.532 --> 37:12.118
- Thank you.
- Guys, I gotta take off.

37:12.577 --> 37:14.495
- All right. Later.
- Cheers, brother.

37:15.119 --> 37:16.639
- Bye.
- See you soon.

37:21.753 --> 37:23.921
Hey, you wanna stay
for another drink? I'll buy.

37:24.672 --> 37:25.673
Clearly.

37:26.630 --> 37:29.508
Feisty tonight.
Glasses really bring it out in you.

37:29.591 --> 37:30.884
Maybe.

37:31.429 --> 37:32.638
I'll take a Jack and Coke.

38:46.879 --> 38:49.632
Hi. I'm looking for Allison.

38:49.716 --> 38:51.634
- She's not here.
- Wait, Tom?

38:53.136 --> 38:54.136
How do you know my name?

38:54.887 --> 38:58.057
I'm a friend of Allison's.
I just want to talk to her.

38:59.100 --> 39:02.937
Well, um... she's not expecting you, and
we're kind of in the middle of some...

39:03.021 --> 39:04.605
- Allison?
- Whoa.

39:05.356 --> 39:06.357
You fucking kidding me?

39:06.939 --> 39:08.649
I told you, I just
want to see her, okay?

39:08.735 --> 39:11.821
I'm not here to arrest you
or whatever it is you're afraid of.

39:13.197 --> 39:14.782
Oh...

39:15.491 --> 39:16.993
You're her fucking shrink.

39:17.994 --> 39:19.662
She told me she started seeing you.

39:20.202 --> 39:22.079
Just a bunch of crap, I told her.

39:22.957 --> 39:24.083
Tom!

39:24.167 --> 39:25.668
Don't you fucking say another word.

39:25.749 --> 39:27.668
Wait, she's in the bathroom?
What's she doing?

39:27.751 --> 39:30.295
She won't come out,
even if you ask her to.

39:31.299 --> 39:32.300
Why is that?

39:32.633 --> 39:34.677
'Cause she's trying to fuck with me.

39:35.592 --> 39:36.592
Pretend that I hurt her.

39:37.221 --> 39:38.639
Another story she invented.

39:40.597 --> 39:43.350
But, uh, be my guest, lady.

39:56.324 --> 39:57.324
Hey!

39:58.117 --> 39:59.452
Good luck with that bitch.

40:03.998 --> 40:05.166
Allison?

40:06.918 --> 40:08.378
Allison, it's Jean.

40:09.128 --> 40:10.463
I just want to talk to you.

40:24.602 --> 40:28.481
I don't like to talk about it,
let alone think about it, but, um...

40:29.482 --> 40:31.609
he ended up going back
to his ex-girlfriend.

40:31.943 --> 40:33.069
It was pretty awful,

40:33.444 --> 40:35.947
and they were married two months later.

40:36.030 --> 40:38.866
Oh, that is rough. I'm so sorry.

40:38.947 --> 40:41.491
It was forever ago. It's fine.

40:42.995 --> 40:47.125
I dated this woman
when Jean and I were on a break.

40:47.208 --> 40:49.168
I was ready to settle down, but...

40:49.669 --> 40:51.879
she needed to work some issues out.

40:51.963 --> 40:53.673
And I met Catherine.

40:54.841 --> 40:58.761
And I thought that she was
everything I ever wanted.

41:00.263 --> 41:02.765
But, um... you know,

41:02.846 --> 41:08.727
the fantasy doesn't last forever,
hard as you try.

41:09.311 --> 41:11.813
I get that, trust me.

41:12.442 --> 41:15.570
Hey, listen,
I am sure there are tons of guys

41:15.653 --> 41:18.364
who are interested in you
and who are not gonna fuck it up.

41:18.448 --> 41:20.283
I am not so sure.

41:21.242 --> 41:23.082
You should see what the guys
on Tinder send me.

41:23.161 --> 41:26.664
Oh, I don't understand how you
meet someone on Tinder.

41:26.748 --> 41:29.375
Oh, that's easy, you just swipe
right if you like someone.

41:30.668 --> 41:33.087
Thank you, Alexis.
I understand the technology.

41:33.168 --> 41:34.168
I appreciate that.

41:34.672 --> 41:36.257
I'll spare you the countless dick pics.

41:36.507 --> 41:38.587
No, come on.
Guys don't actually send those, do they?

41:38.634 --> 41:39.969
Oh, you have no idea.

41:44.849 --> 41:46.851
Okay, Nick. Yeah.

41:47.891 --> 41:48.892
And he likes it rough.

41:48.976 --> 41:51.853
He couldn't save that for some
porn forum or something like that?

41:51.939 --> 41:53.024
Is that what you do?

41:54.815 --> 41:56.775
Kidding, completely kidding.

41:59.238 --> 42:01.240
It's fine, it's fine. I'm just kidding.

42:02.033 --> 42:03.701
Actually, uh,

42:03.785 --> 42:06.704
I took some adorable pictures
of Dolly from the party.

42:06.788 --> 42:09.457
- Oh, that disaster?
- I didn't want to pry.

42:09.540 --> 42:12.460
No, it's, uh... it was fine,
just mom politics.

42:12.543 --> 42:14.045
I'm sure you'll see it some day.

42:14.126 --> 42:15.126
Maybe.

42:19.509 --> 42:22.595
- Aww, send me that one.
- Sure.

42:23.385 --> 42:24.803
- Shit.
- All right.

42:24.886 --> 42:26.054
Nope, didn't see anything.

42:26.641 --> 42:27.684
Yeah, right.

42:27.767 --> 42:30.353
On that note,
I think it's time to call it a night.

42:30.436 --> 42:31.437
Um...

42:32.146 --> 42:34.399
I've had three beers.
I'm pretty buzzed. It's pathetic.

42:34.482 --> 42:35.858
Yeah, me too.

42:39.362 --> 42:41.656
Just to be clear,
that was a shot for Nick, right?

42:42.448 --> 42:46.119
You're such a smartass, you know that?

42:49.956 --> 42:51.749
He's unpredictable,

42:53.000 --> 42:54.001
you're right.

42:58.881 --> 43:00.800
I tried to flush everything.

43:02.468 --> 43:04.137
My shit, his shit.

43:05.138 --> 43:08.391
He got angry, and he was coked
up, so he just came at me.

43:10.893 --> 43:14.313
It's like, if I don't do what he says
he's a wild animal.

43:18.276 --> 43:19.944
Why don't you just leave?

43:21.279 --> 43:22.279
Thanks.

43:22.864 --> 43:24.073
Where am I gonna go?

43:27.618 --> 43:28.786
Tom loves me,

43:30.202 --> 43:33.914
and he takes care of me
in his own fucked up way.

43:34.498 --> 43:35.415
It might not be ideal,

43:35.501 --> 43:39.255
but I figure it's just easier
to hide until he calms down.

43:42.550 --> 43:43.801
When I was still at Fordham,

43:43.885 --> 43:46.387
just when all this shit
started to take over,

43:48.097 --> 43:53.686
I'd sit in the park over there
and just swing for hours.

43:55.646 --> 43:57.607
It was the only place I felt safe.

43:59.189 --> 44:02.359
Well, if he's violent,
there are always other options.

44:03.946 --> 44:04.947
Like what?

44:06.491 --> 44:08.826
Don't you have a friend
that you could stay with?

44:09.577 --> 44:11.662
Maybe for a few nights, but then what?

44:12.538 --> 44:15.541
It's not like I have any money
to get my own place.

44:19.379 --> 44:21.506
I just want to go back to my mom,

44:21.964 --> 44:23.925
but we're not even talking, so...

44:25.468 --> 44:29.639
Well, we can deal with that, but we
need to get you to a meeting first.

44:29.803 --> 44:32.055
I don't even want her
to see me like this.

44:35.311 --> 44:37.522
I mean, you wouldn't even recognize me.

44:38.815 --> 44:42.985
I worked on the yearbook.
I was editor-in-chief of the paper.

44:46.489 --> 44:49.200
People always said I
had a bright future.

44:50.198 --> 44:51.533
That's great.

44:51.869 --> 44:54.872
Whatever. It's nothing now.
I'm not even at school.

44:59.001 --> 45:00.878
And the way that she looks at me,

45:04.590 --> 45:07.009
I can see how much she hates me.

45:09.387 --> 45:13.975
It's in her eyes, you know?
Just... complete disdain.

45:21.274 --> 45:24.444
I don't have a great relationship
with my mother, either.

45:28.320 --> 45:33.617
All I ever wanted when I was young was
to just get out of that house,

45:34.078 --> 45:35.246
and I did.

45:36.581 --> 45:38.583
I made something of my life.

45:40.918 --> 45:42.795
You just have to be strong,

45:43.588 --> 45:45.840
and find an outlet that isn't drugs.

45:47.380 --> 45:49.591
Please, just tell me, and I'll do it.

45:52.764 --> 45:56.893
Well, for me, I realized
I could help people.

45:57.977 --> 46:00.563
But sometimes it's easier
to live for others

46:00.646 --> 46:05.026
than it is to figure out
how to live for yourself.

46:08.863 --> 46:09.947
It's hard.

46:11.908 --> 46:13.826
And I make mistakes.

46:17.997 --> 46:20.541
I have to make tough judgment calls.

46:22.085 --> 46:23.211
Like...

46:24.587 --> 46:26.839
I shouldn't even be here right now.

46:27.173 --> 46:28.674
I'm happy you came.

46:32.133 --> 46:34.302
I don't think I should leave you.

46:35.640 --> 46:37.100
I'll be okay.

46:38.518 --> 46:39.519
I promise.

46:42.480 --> 46:44.065
It'll be our secret.
