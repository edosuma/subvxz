00:31.083 --> 00:32.753
About two minutes.

Look, I know DeLamb,
Baron Bedlam, staged a coup.

00:36.923 --> 00:39.459

11:21.967 --> 11:24.437
And so should you!

11:24.504 --> 11:28.075
Tara, I dedicated my life
to rescuing you,

11:28.140 --> 11:29.808
but you lied to me

11:29.875 --> 11:32.644
and nearly betrayed us all.

11:32.711 --> 11:34.514
You are an assassin!

11:34.581 --> 11:36.917
I am a hero!

11:36.982 --> 11:39.086
[Conner] Heroes don't do
what you did.

11:39.152 --> 11:40.486
The people would disagree.

11:40.553 --> 11:43.123
Would you condemn
a soldier in war?

11:43.190 --> 11:46.759
No, you'd call him <i>Varonis,
a hero.</i>

11:46.826 --> 11:48.595
And I'd call this hero

11:48.660 --> 11:49.696

11:49.763 --> 11:53.734
-A King.
-King? But Gregor...

Kings make hard decisions
for the sake of their people.

11:57.370 --> 11:59.572
You know I supported Gregor,

11:59.639 --> 12:03.110
but Gregor isn't strong
enough for these times.

12:03.176 --> 12:06.947
Only you have the strength
to rule Markovia.

12:07.013 --> 12:11.051
With the full support
of the Military.

12:11.118 --> 12:14.221

the tyrant, DeLamb,

what our country needs.

12:54.995 --> 12:57.230
Brion, you cannot
betray Gregor.

12:57.297 --> 13:00.567
Unlike you, I betray no one.

13:00.634 --> 13:05.004
Gregor's 16 minutes is
no justification for his Rule.

An Outsider executing an enemy

the argument now

because we're all afraid
of the same tired old story.

21:53.233 --> 21:55.368
"The hero gets lost
fighting the good fight

21:55.435 --> 21:58.404
"and becomes the very thing
he or she is fighting against."

21:58.471 --> 22:00.272
And, sure, it happens.

22:00.339 --> 22:02.742
Vandal Savage, Teth Adam,

22:02.808 --> 22:07.446
Ra's al Ghul. And now,
sadly, Geo-Force.

22:07.513 --> 22:09.682
But it will not
happen again.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.551
Not to any of us.

22:11.618 --> 22:14.820
Because from here on out,
we will not keep secrets
from each other.

22:14.887 --> 22:17.723
We need each other
to know each others' secrets

22:17.790 --> 22:20.027
to keep each other
on the straight and narrow.

22:20.094 --> 22:22.863
No more making decisions
to protect each other

22:22.930 --> 22:25.365
from the choices
we might be forced to make.

22:25.432 --> 22:29.502
In this League, the ends
will not justify the means!

22:29.569 --> 22:33.306
We will not sink to using
the methods of our enemies.

22:33.373 --> 22:35.075
We will keep our covert Team,

22:35.142 --> 22:37.576
not for the sake
of it being covert,

22:37.644 --> 22:39.578
but because it affords
our young heroes

22:39.645 --> 22:41.615
a place to learn
out of the spotlight.

22:41.681 --> 22:44.050
But, otherwise,
like the Outsiders,

22:44.117 --> 22:46.852
we must live
in each others' spotlights.

22:46.919 --> 22:47.721
[groans]

22:47.788 --> 22:49.289
If we fail while doing right,

22:49.355 --> 22:52.792
then at least we went down
swinging on our own terms.

22:52.858 --> 22:55.796
But in the long term,
we will not fail.

22:55.862 --> 22:57.864
Holding firm
to our principles

22:57.931 --> 23:01.567
will guide us
to an honorable victory!

23:01.634 --> 23:06.434
Now, let's get down
to business.
