00:18.127 --> 00:19.196
Niles, what are you doing?

00:19.807 --> 00:22.844
This fruit-nut muffin contains
a number of things I don't care for.

00:24.287 --> 00:27.245
Currants, a husk of something...

00:27.407 --> 00:29.921
Away, wrinkly thing.

00:31.647 --> 00:33.877
You know, if you and Maris
ever reconcile,

00:34.047 --> 00:36.607
I'm going to miss
these tranquil mornings.

00:36.767 --> 00:40.919
I reading my newspaper,
you tweezing your muffin.

00:42.207 --> 00:43.481
- Hey, boys.
NILES: Hello, Dad.

00:43.647 --> 00:45.922
Hey, I got a letter from
my old Army pal, Bud Farrell.

00:46.127 --> 00:48.880
The whole platoon's getting together
next weekend in Rattlesnake Ridge.

00:49.047 --> 00:50.526
FRASIER:
Good for you.

00:50.687 --> 00:55.044
Speaking of old chums, Daphne,
a Clive called for you a little earlier.

00:55.247 --> 00:57.841
Clive? Did he sound British?

00:58.527 --> 01:01.166
No, he was one of those
fiery Mexican Clives.

01:03.047 --> 01:05.402
- He said he'd call back.
DAPHNE: Yeah, I'll bet he will.

01:05.567 --> 01:07.683
MARTIN: Oh, boy, I can't wait
to see the old gang.

01:07.847 --> 01:10.566
Dad, you're not thinking of driving
all the way to Rattlesnake Ridge?

01:10.727 --> 01:12.445
It's five hours away.
Your hip stiffens up.

01:12.607 --> 01:15.167
No problem. They said
I can bring a guest.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.756
So who's the lucky one?

01:18.247 --> 01:21.000
Well, by my count,
two of us get to be lucky.

01:21.207 --> 01:22.799
Come on, they're great guys.

01:22.967 --> 01:25.197
Stinky, Wolfman, Boom-Boom,

01:25.407 --> 01:27.045
Jim. Of course, his name's
not really Jim.

01:27.207 --> 01:29.198
We call him that because he likes
to drink Jim Beam.

01:29.367 --> 01:31.881
Just like we call Hank "Bud"
because he drinks Budweiser.

01:32.047 --> 01:33.765
Come on, you'd love these guys.

01:33.967 --> 01:37.039
We're sherry drinkers, Dad.
Think about it.

01:39.607 --> 01:41.245
Anyway, I have a conference
that weekend.

01:41.407 --> 01:43.762
Yeah, and I have me friend Megan's
birthday party.

01:43.967 --> 01:44.956
Fras?

01:45.127 --> 01:46.116
[PHONE RINGING]

01:46.287 --> 01:49.040
Oh, please let that be Megan
needing a clown for her party.

01:51.607 --> 01:53.325
Hello?

01:53.847 --> 01:55.405
Oh, Clive.

01:56.527 --> 01:58.916
Yes, it has been a long time, hasn't it?

02:00.327 --> 02:04.161
Oh, I am sorry.
I have dinner plans tonight.

02:04.647 --> 02:09.003
Well, maybe just a drink, then.
Say 6:30?

02:09.607 --> 02:11.677
Me too. Bye.

02:13.127 --> 02:14.321
Oh, hell.

02:15.047 --> 02:16.878
So who is this Clive?

02:17.247 --> 02:19.522
- An ex-boyfriend?
DAPHNE: Worse.

02:19.727 --> 02:21.080
Ex-fiancë.

02:21.287 --> 02:22.606
You were engaged?

02:22.767 --> 02:26.157
For years.
Oh, we were mad for each other.

02:26.367 --> 02:29.564
He was very sweet and had
the most gorgeous eyes you ever saw.

02:29.847 --> 02:32.645
- But?
- Oh, yes, that too.

02:36.727 --> 02:41.198
I just couldn't see a future with him.
I mean, the man was a total layabout.

02:41.407 --> 02:44.126
No ambition, no drive.
He couldn't hold a job.

02:44.327 --> 02:46.682
All he wanted to do
was tinker about with his car.

02:46.847 --> 02:48.997
His hands were always black
from the motor oil.

02:49.207 --> 02:50.322
What a brutish habit.

02:50.487 --> 02:52.239
If God had intended me
to work on my Mercedes,

02:52.407 --> 02:54.363
he wouldn't have given me Horst.

02:55.607 --> 02:58.883
I had to break it off.
But I wanted to let him down easily,

02:59.047 --> 03:03.563
so I said if we were still free
in five years, we could try again.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.440
And here he is, right on schedule.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.718
What do I say to him?

03:08.927 --> 03:10.360
Be honest. Tell him how you feel.

03:10.567 --> 03:12.285
What, to break
the poor thing's heart again?

03:12.487 --> 03:15.285
In the long run, honesty's the best way
to avoid unnecessary anguish.

03:15.447 --> 03:16.675
Well, case in point.

03:17.167 --> 03:19.601
Dad, I do not have plans
for next weekend,

03:19.767 --> 03:21.997
but I do not intend to spend it
in the middle of nowhere

03:22.167 --> 03:26.001
with Budweiser and Boilermaker
and their liver-damaged friend, Seltzer.

03:28.007 --> 03:30.396
Well, that's fine.
There will be other reunions.

03:30.567 --> 03:33.127
There, you see? No evasions,
no convenient conferences,

03:33.287 --> 03:34.959
just simple honesty.

03:35.167 --> 03:37.078
Course, I don't suppose
Jim'll make it next time.

03:37.247 --> 03:39.522
Says here he just had
his third bypass.

03:39.687 --> 03:42.247
- But I guess I'll see him at his funeral.
- Off to work.

03:42.607 --> 03:44.086
MARTIN:
Unless I go first!

03:44.287 --> 03:46.403
All right! I'll drive you
to your stupid reunion.

03:46.567 --> 03:48.319
MARTIN:
Thanks, son.

03:48.527 --> 03:52.042
I guess I better wait a few days
to tell him about Stinky needing a ride.

04:00.207 --> 04:04.678
And in closing, this goes out to Keith,
the narcoleptic I spoke to earlier.

04:04.847 --> 04:07.566
I'd be glad to resume our conversation
when you feel a bit more alert.

04:07.727 --> 04:09.240
But in the meantime,

04:09.407 --> 04:13.639
I suggest that you reconsider applying
for that air-traffic-control position.

04:14.767 --> 04:18.646
This is Dr Frasier Crane,
KACL 780 AM.

04:18.807 --> 04:22.516
Brilliant show, Frasier.
Chock-full of pithy insight.

04:22.727 --> 04:24.479
- What do you want?
GIL: A favour.

04:24.687 --> 04:26.518
Bonnie Weems, the Auto Lady,
just asked me

04:26.687 --> 04:28.803
to another one
of her wretched dinner parties.

04:29.007 --> 04:31.726
I'm planning on saying that you and I
have ballet tickets that night,

04:31.887 --> 04:33.957
- so do back me up.
- I'm sorry, I can't.

04:34.127 --> 04:37.278
No, you've got to. Have you any idea
how vile her food is?

04:37.447 --> 04:41.281
The local raccoons have posted
warning signs on her trash bin.

04:41.807 --> 04:43.206
Yes, you see,
she already invited me,

04:43.367 --> 04:46.677
and I told her I was driving my father to
his Army reunion at Rattlesnake Ridge.

04:46.887 --> 04:47.922
Oh, very clever.

04:48.087 --> 04:49.315
Well, I'd use it myself,

04:49.487 --> 04:52.479
only I killed my father off
to escape her Labor Day clambake.

04:54.407 --> 04:57.399
Oh, Roz. Listen, I'm going
to the opera tomorrow night.

04:57.607 --> 05:00.041
- You didn't happen to remember my...?
- Oh, your opera glasses.

05:00.207 --> 05:02.641
I'm so sorry.
They completely slipped my mind.

05:02.847 --> 05:04.565
I wouldn't mind
if you hadn't borrowed them

05:04.727 --> 05:06.524
to ogle that bodybuilder
across the street.

05:06.727 --> 05:08.718
I've looked once or twice.

05:09.887 --> 05:11.798
It's not like I copied his name
off his mailbox

05:11.967 --> 05:14.561
so I could look up his number
and call him while he's in the shower

05:14.727 --> 05:17.480
so I could watch him cross the room
naked to answer the phone.

05:17.887 --> 05:19.366
That would be wrong.

05:20.127 --> 05:22.243
<i>I want them back. I refuse
to squint through Pagliacci</i>

05:22.407 --> 05:24.875
<i>while you're trying to watch
The Magic Flute.</i>

05:28.647 --> 05:30.126
[PLAYING PIANO]

05:30.287 --> 05:33.757
DAPHNE: Dr Crane,
I need your opinion on this outfit.

05:33.927 --> 05:38.682
I wanted something that sent
no romantic signals whatsoever.

05:41.167 --> 05:45.046
Well, short of a cactus corsage,
I think you've captured it.

05:46.327 --> 05:47.840
You know, Daphne,
it's been five years.

05:48.007 --> 05:49.804
That's an awfully long time
to carry a torch.

05:49.967 --> 05:52.925
- Maybe he just wants to say hello.
- Oh, I certainly hope so.

05:53.087 --> 05:56.204
The thought of having to reject the poor
thing again is more than I can bear.

05:56.367 --> 05:57.436
[DOORBELL RINGS]

05:57.607 --> 05:59.723
Oh, dear. It's him.

05:59.887 --> 06:01.605
- Anything between me teeth?
- No.

06:01.767 --> 06:03.405
Do we have any spinach
in the fridge?

06:03.567 --> 06:05.797
Just answer the door.

06:10.087 --> 06:13.159
Oh, Dr Crane.
I was afraid you were Clive.

06:13.327 --> 06:14.965
Clive? Oh, Clive.

06:15.127 --> 06:17.357
Oh, was that tonight?

06:18.127 --> 06:22.757
Oh, well, don't I feel silly bringing over
this thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle.

06:24.887 --> 06:27.606
Niles, I'm sure that Daphne doesn't
want us horning in on her reunion.

06:27.767 --> 06:29.678
- We're going to dinner.
- Well, can we order in?

06:29.847 --> 06:32.236
I've already assembled one kitten
and two yarn balls.

06:34.567 --> 06:36.717
I'm getting my jacket.

06:36.887 --> 06:38.366
[DOORBELL RINGS]

06:38.847 --> 06:41.042
Niles, for God's sake,
will you give them some privacy.

06:49.247 --> 06:51.761
- Hello.
- Hello.

06:51.967 --> 06:53.639
Look at you. You look wonderful.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.680
- Oh, go on!
- No, no, I mean it.

06:56.887 --> 06:58.605
Very pretty and warm.

07:01.007 --> 07:02.486
So...

07:02.647 --> 07:03.921
So...

07:07.647 --> 07:08.636
- Oh, God.
- What?

07:08.807 --> 07:10.718
I've gotten a spot of axle grease
on your sweater.

07:10.887 --> 07:14.197
Oh, no, it's all right, really.
It's just a ratty old thing.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.164
Please, come in.

07:16.327 --> 07:20.206
- Same old Clive, I see.
- I suppose so.

07:20.367 --> 07:23.439
So, what brings you to Seattle?

07:23.847 --> 07:25.166
My undying love for you.

07:25.327 --> 07:28.319
Oh, damn! I meant
to lead up to that. Sorry.

07:28.767 --> 07:31.884
- No, it's all right. Just a bit...
- Abrupt.

07:32.047 --> 07:34.322
No "how are you,"
no "nice place you have here."

07:34.487 --> 07:38.036
By the way, it is lovely.
Is that the Space Needle?

07:38.207 --> 07:40.482
- Clive.
- Big.

07:41.287 --> 07:44.324
Anyway, I remembered
what you told me five years ago,

07:44.887 --> 07:46.525
and I thought my feelings
might change.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.605
- Five years is a long time, but...
- Oh, Clive.

07:49.767 --> 07:51.086
No, no, let me finish.

07:51.327 --> 07:53.045
My feelings for you haven't changed.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.482
I think about you every day,
every night.

07:55.647 --> 07:57.239
And there comes a time
in every man's life

07:57.407 --> 08:00.319
when he's gotta summon the courage
to look a woman in the eye and say...

08:00.527 --> 08:02.358
NILES:
Cheese Nips?

08:06.727 --> 08:09.002
I'm sorry. Is this a bad moment?

08:09.207 --> 08:11.596
- Well, actually, I was...
- No, no, not at all.

08:12.447 --> 08:16.156
Well, this is my very dear old friend,
Clive Roddy.

08:16.327 --> 08:19.000
Clive, I'd like you to meet
Dr Niles Crane...

08:19.727 --> 08:21.763
...my husband.

08:26.647 --> 08:28.205
- Your husband?
- Oh, yes.

08:28.407 --> 08:30.682
Six months next week.

08:30.847 --> 08:33.202
Well, congratulations.

08:33.366 --> 08:34.958
You're a very lucky man.

08:35.167 --> 08:36.361
[GIGGLES]

08:41.527 --> 08:43.756
CLIVE: Six months? You two
are practically newlyweds.

08:43.927 --> 08:46.566
Yes, we're still
at that honeymoon stage.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.321
It's sickening, really.

08:52.487 --> 08:54.557
Revolting.

08:57.287 --> 09:00.359
- Positively stomach-turning.
- Darling!

09:00.567 --> 09:02.080
- Well, I should be going.
NILES: No!

09:02.247 --> 09:03.362
I mean...

09:04.087 --> 09:06.043
...we're so enjoying having you here.

09:08.007 --> 09:09.156
I did promise you a drink.

09:09.327 --> 09:11.636
Oh, well, I suppose I could
stay for a beer.

09:11.807 --> 09:13.445
Oh, good.

09:13.607 --> 09:15.916
Darling, would you give me a hand
in the kitchen, please?

09:16.087 --> 09:18.521
Certainly, my angel.

09:21.047 --> 09:22.685
Dr Crane, I'm so sorry.

09:22.847 --> 09:24.883
It seemed the kindest way
to let him down.

09:25.087 --> 09:27.282
I didn't mean to put you
in such an awkward position.

09:27.447 --> 09:30.644
When it comes to you,
no position is too awkward.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.798
Oh, hello. You must be Clive.

09:35.967 --> 09:38.162
- Yeah. And you're?
- Dr Frasier Crane.

09:38.367 --> 09:39.800
Oh, Niles' brother.

09:40.007 --> 09:42.521
- Yes. You've met Niles?
- Just now.

09:42.727 --> 09:45.241
Though I used to know
his wife quite well.

09:48.487 --> 09:50.876
Really, you know his wife?

09:51.087 --> 09:54.523
- She's one of a kind, that one.
- Isn't she?

09:56.527 --> 09:57.960
Certainly can light up a room.

09:58.167 --> 10:00.681
Oh, yes. Usually by leaving it.

10:02.367 --> 10:04.358
- Frasier!
DAPHNE: Clive!

10:04.567 --> 10:07.206
I see you've met
my husband's brother.

10:07.407 --> 10:10.638
CLIVE: Yeah. I'm not intruding
on some family occasion, am I?

10:10.847 --> 10:12.121
Oh, no, not at all.

10:12.287 --> 10:14.562
Frasier lives here.
I mean, temporarily.

10:14.767 --> 10:18.476
- You see, he's...
- He's had a spat with his wife.

10:19.927 --> 10:21.406
Maris.

10:25.607 --> 10:26.801
Sorry to hear that.

10:27.007 --> 10:28.998
Yes, me too.

10:29.327 --> 10:30.601
You know, Daphne, I'm parched.

10:30.807 --> 10:34.038
Could you show me again
where we keep the wine?

10:34.207 --> 10:36.243
Of course.
Could you spare me a minute?

10:36.407 --> 10:39.922
Oh, wait.
You have to pay the love toll.

10:42.367 --> 10:43.925
Too much. Here's your change.

10:50.767 --> 10:52.962
Can you stay for dinner?

10:54.567 --> 10:56.398
I told you to be honest,
but did you listen? No.

10:56.567 --> 10:58.717
No, instead, you subject us
to this charade.

10:58.927 --> 11:00.280
Just play along, please.

11:00.447 --> 11:02.722
I swear, one drink
and he's out the door.

11:02.927 --> 11:05.157
- He's staying for dinner.
- What?

11:05.727 --> 11:08.161
- Well, how did that happen?
- He just sort of invited himself.

11:08.327 --> 11:10.841
Pretty damn cheeky, if you ask me.

11:11.287 --> 11:12.276
Dear God.

11:12.447 --> 11:14.165
Obviously he has hopes
of winning you back.

11:14.327 --> 11:18.036
We must keep these displays
of affection as realistic as possible.

11:18.967 --> 11:21.197
What will I serve?
Do we still have that lasagne?

11:21.367 --> 11:23.927
You don't expect me to endure
an entire evening of this nonsense.

11:24.087 --> 11:25.156
DAPHNE:
Just do this for me,

11:25.327 --> 11:27.238
and anything you want,
name anything, it's yours.

11:27.847 --> 11:29.803
Anything?

11:30.007 --> 11:31.963
Except Rattlesnake Ridge.

11:32.287 --> 11:34.847
- Oh, Clive?
- All right, I'll take him.

11:35.327 --> 11:38.125
- Lasagne all right for dinner?
- Super.

11:38.687 --> 11:41.485
I'm warning you, one thing goes wrong
and the whole deal's off.

11:41.647 --> 11:42.762
Oh, it can't go wrong.

11:42.927 --> 11:45.839
We just have to stick to our stories
and avoid unnecessary complications.

11:46.007 --> 11:47.884
MARTIN:
Well, I see we got company!

11:48.247 --> 11:49.396
NILES: Dad!
FRASIER: Dad!

11:49.567 --> 11:51.125
DAPHNE:
Dad!

11:55.367 --> 11:59.076
Clive, I'd like you to meet
my new husband's father.

11:59.287 --> 12:03.246
Or as we sometimes say
in this country, father-in-law.

12:03.687 --> 12:06.884
- I'm Clive Roddy.
- Yeah, hi, Marty Crane.

12:07.047 --> 12:08.480
Somebody tell me what's...

12:08.687 --> 12:11.884
Daphne, we've been so remiss.
We haven't even given Clive the tour.

12:12.047 --> 12:15.357
Oh, yes, quite right.
Well, this is the living room.

12:15.527 --> 12:18.439
Well, I think he'd be more interested
in the master bathroom.

12:19.367 --> 12:23.758
The shower being so large,
and Manchester being so rainy.

12:25.287 --> 12:27.437
DAPHNE: Right this way.
- There you go.

12:27.607 --> 12:29.518
- Oh, you forgot to pay the toll.
FRASIER: Niles!

12:29.687 --> 12:31.006
NILES:
Never mind.

12:33.407 --> 12:35.045
- All right, now go away.
- What for?

12:35.207 --> 12:36.356
What the hell's going on here?

12:36.567 --> 12:38.080
Clive is Daphne's old boyfriend.

12:38.247 --> 12:40.841
She's letting him down easily by
pretending to be married to Niles.

12:41.047 --> 12:42.275
NILES:
So this is my place.

12:42.447 --> 12:45.564
Frasier is staying here temporarily
because he's separated from Maris.

12:45.767 --> 12:47.883
You couldn't stand her either, huh?

12:52.967 --> 12:55.003
That's very amusing.

12:55.207 --> 12:57.038
- Do I still live here?
- Yes, of course you do.

12:57.247 --> 12:59.556
For this evening, it might be best
if you excused yourself.

12:59.767 --> 13:02.042
You see, it requires quick thinking,
improvisational skills

13:02.247 --> 13:04.158
- and a knack for remembering details.
- Well,

13:04.327 --> 13:06.318
never used any of those skills
as an undercover cop.

13:06.487 --> 13:08.717
- Please, Dad, don't be offended.
- I'm not offended. No.

13:08.887 --> 13:11.481
My two sons have just said
I have oatmeal for brains.

13:11.647 --> 13:14.286
So Daphne tells me you're both
psychiatrists.

13:14.487 --> 13:16.239
- Yes.
CLIVE: Fascinating.

13:16.447 --> 13:19.917
- You a psychiatrist as well, Marty?
- Oh, me? No, no, I'm retired.

13:20.127 --> 13:21.799
And what did you do?

13:22.367 --> 13:24.722
I was an astronaut.

13:28.487 --> 13:30.000
CLIVE:
Were you?

13:30.207 --> 13:32.562
- You actually flew space missions?
- Yeah, a few.

13:32.727 --> 13:35.082
Me and Neil Armstrong.
Buzz Aldrin.

13:35.487 --> 13:38.206
Yeah, I was the one who gave him
his nickname Buzz, you know.

13:38.807 --> 13:41.640
Yeah, most people think
it's because he flew fast. Not true.

13:41.807 --> 13:43.365
He was scared of bees.

13:44.967 --> 13:46.685
[DOORBELL RINGS]

13:59.927 --> 14:01.645
Who is it?

14:01.807 --> 14:03.445
ROZ:
Open up, Frasier, it's me.

14:03.647 --> 14:05.842
What do you know, it's Maris!

14:11.567 --> 14:14.286
Here are your stupid opera glasses.
Are we friends again?

14:14.447 --> 14:15.675
FRASIER:
Darling!

14:15.847 --> 14:17.121
FRASIER: You're Maris.
- What?

14:17.287 --> 14:18.276
FRASIER: We're married.
- What?

14:18.447 --> 14:19.596
FRASIER:
Play along.

14:20.007 --> 14:21.759
Well, their little tiff's over.

14:21.927 --> 14:25.556
Maris Crane, this is Mr Clive Roddy.

14:25.847 --> 14:28.839
- It's a pleasure.
- It certainly is.

14:29.447 --> 14:31.915
- So how long will you be in Seattle?
- Oh, Cupcake.

14:32.087 --> 14:34.317
If you'd excuse us,
we could use a moment alone.

14:34.487 --> 14:35.966
Just come with me, darling.

14:36.127 --> 14:38.595
So now you've met
the whole Crane clan.

14:38.807 --> 14:40.604
Although, Daphne, I noticed
in the phone book

14:40.767 --> 14:42.041
you're still listed as Moon.

14:42.207 --> 14:44.801
That must be an old book.
Now she hyphenates.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.844
It's Moon-Crane.

14:47.767 --> 14:50.804
I remember the first time
I ever drove a moon crane.

14:50.967 --> 14:54.039
Damn near rolled it
into the Sea of Tranquillity.

14:56.687 --> 14:58.882
So, Clive, what do you do?

14:59.247 --> 15:01.238
Still mucking about with cars, I see.

15:01.407 --> 15:05.559
Oh, me hands? No, I helped a lady
change a tire on the way over here.

15:05.927 --> 15:07.883
Don't have as much time for cars
as I used to,

15:08.087 --> 15:09.361
what with my business and all.

15:09.967 --> 15:11.685
- Your business?
- Yeah.

15:11.847 --> 15:14.156
After you left, I remembered
the advice you used to give me,

15:14.327 --> 15:15.726
and I decided
some of it made sense.

15:15.927 --> 15:17.485
- What advice?
CLIVE: Well, you know...

15:17.687 --> 15:20.440
"Get a job, you lazy git,"
that sort of thing.

15:20.967 --> 15:22.320
So I took a few business courses

15:22.527 --> 15:24.165
and opened up
a little sporting-goods shop.

15:24.327 --> 15:25.965
Next thing you know,
I had three of them.

15:26.127 --> 15:29.358
Well, isn't this ironic.

15:32.807 --> 15:36.402
All these years, I nagged him
to make something of himself.

15:36.567 --> 15:37.716
And now look at him:

15:37.887 --> 15:41.436
A captain of industry
and still as handsome as ever.

15:42.007 --> 15:45.522
Yes, well, send in the clowns.

15:46.687 --> 15:48.803
Don't bother, they're here.

15:49.287 --> 15:50.402
Well, bad news.

15:50.567 --> 15:53.843
It seems my Maris has to run off.
She's got a previous engagement.

15:54.047 --> 15:55.878
Oh, forget about
your engagement, Maris.

15:56.047 --> 15:57.162
Stay for dinner.

15:57.367 --> 15:58.516
- Actually...
- I'd love to!

15:58.687 --> 16:01.884
Lovely. We can celebrate
you two being reconciled.

16:02.047 --> 16:03.685
That is still tentative.

16:04.407 --> 16:06.045
It could go either way.

16:09.007 --> 16:12.204
CLIVE:
Hello there. What's his name?

16:16.287 --> 16:17.640
ALL:
Eddie!

16:20.607 --> 16:24.486
So there I was,
floating 20 feet up in the chamber,

16:24.647 --> 16:26.683
when some idiot turns off
the weightless button

16:26.847 --> 16:27.916
and down I come,

16:28.087 --> 16:30.920
right on this big pickaxe
we used for moon rocks.

16:32.887 --> 16:34.445
And you still walk with a cane?

16:34.647 --> 16:36.000
<i>Que será será.</i>

16:36.807 --> 16:38.604
Well, I'd better turn in, boys.

16:38.807 --> 16:41.401
Don't forget your
warm glass of Tang.

16:44.167 --> 16:45.680
It was an honour meeting you,
commander.

16:45.847 --> 16:46.962
Yeah, I had fun too.

16:48.047 --> 16:50.083
- Well, good night, all.
NILES: Good night, Dad.

16:50.607 --> 16:52.120
Delicious meal, Daphne.

16:52.287 --> 16:54.243
Can't remember the last time
I ate so much.

16:54.727 --> 16:57.366
Well, that explains
your fantastic physique.

16:57.567 --> 17:00.286
Yes, you are looking
wonderfully firm.

17:01.207 --> 17:02.799
You used to have that little tummy.

17:02.967 --> 17:05.527
- Do you work out?
- Yeah, when I can.

17:05.686 --> 17:07.996
Actually, my shops keep me
pretty busy.

17:08.207 --> 17:10.117
Daphne and I have our own
little exercise regimen.

17:10.287 --> 17:13.244
We work up quite a sweat,
don't we, darling?

17:14.887 --> 17:16.286
DAPHNE:
I can't get over it.

17:16.487 --> 17:19.001
It's like you're
a whole different person.

17:19.367 --> 17:21.198
A whole different person.

17:21.367 --> 17:23.278
Well, who's for coffee?

17:23.487 --> 17:25.443
I'll give you a hand.

17:27.607 --> 17:29.723
Would you please tell Roz
to stop flirting?

17:29.887 --> 17:31.400
Has she forgotten
she's a married woman?

17:31.567 --> 17:32.682
Oh, you're one to talk.

17:32.887 --> 17:35.879
If you batted your eyelashes any
harder, you'd blow out the candles.

17:36.367 --> 17:39.086
You get rid of her now,
or it's Rattlesnake Ridge for you.

17:39.287 --> 17:41.198
- You wouldn't!
- Oh, wouldn't I?

17:41.367 --> 17:43.244
And by the way,

Maris, darling, I don't know about you,
but I'm exhausted.

17:54.487 --> 17:55.966
- You know...
- See you at home.

17:58.087 --> 17:59.440
More wine, please.

17:59.607 --> 18:01.962
Oh, are you sure that's wise, dear?

18:02.167 --> 18:04.601
Remember that blackout
you had last month?

18:04.807 --> 18:06.160
[CHUCKLES]

18:06.327 --> 18:09.364
What am I saying?
Of course you don't.

18:12.127 --> 18:14.595
That's what I love about her,
her sense of humour.

18:14.767 --> 18:16.837
- Cookie, darling?
- Oh, no, thank you.

18:17.127 --> 18:18.924
Some of us do look after our weight.

18:19.407 --> 18:21.796
Now, now, Daphne,
you have to keep your strength up.

18:21.967 --> 18:24.401
You are eating for two.

18:27.367 --> 18:28.846
You're having a baby?

18:29.007 --> 18:31.601
Well, when were you planning
on springing that news?

18:31.807 --> 18:33.604
We don't like to bring that up.

18:33.767 --> 18:36.122
It's a sore point around here,

18:36.287 --> 18:40.121
what with my sister-in-law
being barren and all.

18:42.487 --> 18:47.242
Now, now, it's not her fault.
You see, my brother is impotent.

18:52.967 --> 18:56.084
Well, congratulations.

18:56.247 --> 18:57.441
Is there a loo I could?

18:57.607 --> 18:59.757
Yes, yes, right there
by the front door.

18:59.927 --> 19:01.246
We call that Frasier's bathroom.

19:01.407 --> 19:04.604
That's why we've monogrammed
all the towels with his initials.

19:05.327 --> 19:06.840
Have you all taken leave
of your senses?

19:07.007 --> 19:08.884
DAPHNE: She started it!
Hanging all over him.

19:09.047 --> 19:11.845
What is your problem? Frasier said
the only reason we're doing this

19:12.007 --> 19:13.963
was because you wanted
to give him the brush-off.

19:14.167 --> 19:16.476
Well, I changed me mind.
Didn't you see my signals?

19:16.687 --> 19:20.123
Gee, I must have missed them. It must
have been during one of my blackouts!

19:20.327 --> 19:21.601

Wait, wait, wait.

- Oh, good news, Roz.
- Oh, sod off!

You'd think, with all your dozens
and dozens of men,

19:28.887 --> 19:30.320
you could at least leave one for me.

19:30.487 --> 19:31.920
Dozens? Did you tell her that?

19:32.087 --> 19:34.555
Well, forgive me for keeping track.

19:35.087 --> 19:36.679
Why are you fighting
over the man anyway?

of a cricket bat.

You're right. You know what, Daphne,
you want him, you can have him.

- You can have him, he's yours!
- Oh, yes.

Fat chance I've got,
now that you've told him I'm pregnant.

How am I supposed to get rid
of this bloody baby?

but I'm sorry, I must speak.

You're the most appalling family

You, breaking up with your wife
over a pair of opera glasses.

your nose at me

I don't think there's anything remotely
special about your bathrooms.

And you two women,

20:30.487 --> 20:33.081
flirting shamelessly with me
right in front of your husbands.

20:33.247 --> 20:35.078
You, having just reconciled
with Frasier,

20:35.287 --> 20:37.164
and you, carrying Niles' baby.

20:37.327 --> 20:39.204
Well, I pity your child, Daphne.

20:39.407 --> 20:40.726
And I pity
any good Manchester girl

20:40.887 --> 20:42.639
that comes to this vile,
coffee-swilling Sodom

20:42.807 --> 20:44.559
and lets it change her
like it's changed you.

20:44.727 --> 20:46.638
But I haven't changed. Really.

you think we are.

lying to you all night.

to be lied to anymore.

how two men like you
