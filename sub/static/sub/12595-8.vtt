06:37.264 --> 06:39.433
<b>- An Empire State Building.</b>

06:39.533 --> 06:41.453
<b>- You don't get much coverage</b>
<b>out of one pushpin,</b>

06:41.502 --> 06:43.136
<b> <i>so it's a multiple amount</i> </b>
<b> <i>of pushpins</i> </b>

30:33.546 --> 30:34.786
<b>- Japanese is not my specialty.</b>

30:34.880 --> 30:37.149
<b> <i>- Water is something</i> </b>
<b> <i>that is prevalent</i> </b>

30:37.249 --> 30:38.951
<b> <i>in more than Japanese tattooing.</i> </b>

30:39.051 --> 30:39.919
<b>It's really rough</b>
<b>when you see somebody</b>

30:40.019 --> 30:42.121
<b>that's a really</b>
<b>high-gloss tattooer</b>

30:42.221 --> 30:45.691
<b>not know how to do water</b>
<b>or not know how to do scales.</b>

30:45.724 --> 30:47.284
<b>- You definitely show</b>
<b>a lot of struggle.</b>

30:49.595 --> 30:52.031
<b>- Sausage.</b>

30:52.131 --> 30:53.833
<b> <i>- The legibility</i> </b>
<b> <i>of this tattoo is lost</i> </b>

30:53.933 --> 30:55.301
<b> <i>just in the way you shaded it.</i> </b>

30:55.401 --> 30:57.281
<b> <i>You put black right up</i> </b>
<b> <i>to the edge of the dragon</i> </b>

30:57.336 --> 30:59.205
<b> <i>and then black right inside</i> </b>
<b> <i>the dragon.</i> </b>

30:59.305 --> 31:00.906
<b>The same tones inside the head</b>
<b>as there are</b>

31:01.006 --> 31:02.942
<b>outside of the head...</b>
<b>it makes it overall messy.</b>

31:03.042 --> 31:04.977
<b>- The problem with skin</b>
<b>that has weight loss,</b>

31:05.077 --> 31:06.245
<b>it's much harder</b>
<b>when it's deflated.</b>

31:06.345 --> 31:07.713
<b>- That being said, you do</b>
<b>have some anatomy issues.</b>

31:07.813 --> 31:10.349
<b> <i>The neck is so thick,</i> </b>

31:10.449 --> 31:11.951
<b> <i>and then you really taper down</i> </b>
<b> <i>to this thin body.</i> </b>

31:12.051 --> 31:15.521
<b> <i>It makes it seem like the head</i> </b>
<b> <i>is way in the foreground,</i> </b>

31:15.654 --> 31:16.889
<b> <i>and the rest of the dragon's</i> </b>
<b> <i>way off in the background.</i> </b>

31:16.989 --> 31:19.291
<b>Your big downfall</b>
<b>is the drawing.</b>

31:21.660 --> 31:22.895
<b>- James.</b>

31:22.995 --> 31:25.764
<b>- From the head all the way</b>
<b>to the top,</b>

31:25.865 --> 31:28.300
<b>the flow of the spine,</b>
<b>I love that,</b>

31:28.400 --> 31:30.369
<b>and the really nice</b>
<b>scaling that you did</b>

31:30.469 --> 31:33.205
<b>and the way that the plates fall</b>
<b>over each other on the turns.</b>

31:33.305 --> 31:34.940
<b>Overall, man,</b>
<b>you definitely show off</b>

31:35.040 --> 31:36.041
<b>and do a lot of great things</b>
<b>in this.</b>

31:36.142 --> 31:38.344
<b>- But when you look</b>
<b>at the whole tattoo,</b>

31:38.444 --> 31:39.678
<b>where's the [bleep] face?</b>

31:39.745 --> 31:40.813
<b> <i>Which part of the body</i> </b>
<b> <i>is which part of the body?</i> </b>

31:40.913 --> 31:43.149
<b>When you back up on this thing</b>
<b>five feet,</b>

31:43.249 --> 31:43.949
<b>what the [bleep]</b>
<b>is going on with it?</b>

31:44.049 --> 31:45.951
<b>You have that eyebrow fur,</b>

31:46.051 --> 31:48.187
<b>and then the spine</b>
<b>of the other body coming around</b>

31:48.287 --> 31:50.790
<b>is directly right where</b>
<b>that eyebrow is.</b>

31:50.890 --> 31:52.491
<b>Then you've got the nose,</b>
<b>and where the body</b>

31:52.625 --> 31:54.827
<b>comes off the nose is</b>
<b>perfectly right off that nose...</b>

31:54.927 --> 31:56.295
<b>it's the same green.</b>

31:56.395 --> 31:57.997
<b>It's so on top of itself</b>

31:58.097 --> 32:00.266

32:01.934 --> 32:03.969

32:04.069 --> 32:07.139
<b>who had the best tattoo</b>
<b>of the day.</b>

32:07.239 --> 32:08.941
<b>- Every one of 'em</b>
<b>has challenges.</b>

32:09.041 --> 32:11.777
<b>Which one would I side with?</b>
<b>James.</b>

32:11.877 --> 32:13.946
<b>Just because</b>
<b>it's the most comprehensive</b>

32:14.046 --> 32:15.514
<b>background and foreground.</b>

32:15.648 --> 32:16.916
<b>- I can't tell what the [bleep]</b>
<b>is going on with that, man.</b>

32:17.016 --> 32:18.984
<b>He lost it.</b> <b>- I can't either.</b>

32:19.084 --> 32:20.386

<b>- But the water's nice.</b>

32:20.486 --> 32:22.288
<b> <i>The clouds are nice.</i> </b>
<b> <i>The background's nice.</i> </b>

32:22.388 --> 32:25.157
<b>- You're looking at traditional</b>
<b>Japanese elements.</b>

32:25.257 --> 32:26.959
<b>That's one thing, but we're</b>
<b>looking at overall legibility.</b>

32:27.059 --> 32:29.295
<b>- And when you look at</b>
<b>the whole tattoo,</b>

32:29.395 --> 32:30.763
<b>I think it's confusing</b>
<b>as [bleep] hell.</b>

32:30.863 --> 32:32.865

<b>big, solid, bright, bold.</i> </b>

32:46.011 --> 32:47.113

<b>I would question whether</b>
<b>that person knows how to tattoo.</b>

37:38.691 --> 37:39.291
<b>- But I do feel that mine</b>
<b>was more legible.</b>

37:39.391 --> 37:41.694
<b>- I don't.</b>

37:41.727 --> 37:44.964
<b>- Megan, your tattoo,</b>
<b>you have a lot of camouflaging.</b>

37:45.064 --> 37:47.433
<b>Your water is very similar</b>
<b>to your dragon's beard.</b>

37:47.533 --> 37:49.902
<b>- I did the best I could</b>
<b>with making sure I got black</b>

37:50.002 --> 37:52.404
<b>in the dragon to try and</b>
<b>separate 'em out from the water.</b>

37:52.505 --> 37:54.039
<b>I was trying to hit</b>
<b>the challenge.</b>

37:54.140 --> 37:55.241
<b>- You made this up.</b>

37:55.341 --> 37:56.375
<b>You put the head</b>
<b>where you put it.</b>

37:56.475 --> 37:57.710
<b>You put the body</b>
<b>where you put it.</b>

37:57.810 --> 38:01.213
<b>It was your choices</b>
<b>that made it hard to read.</b>

38:01.313 --> 38:02.114
<b>- Matti.</b>

38:02.214 --> 38:03.649
<b>- You have kind of the weird,</b>

38:03.682 --> 38:05.117
<b>over-top-of-each-other</b>
<b>body thing</b>

38:05.217 --> 38:07.219
<b>that makes it hard to read</b>
<b>where the body's going.</b>

38:07.319 --> 38:08.654
<b>- Um, I get what you say</b>
<b>about it being...</b>

38:08.721 --> 38:11.081
<b>it looks like a really nicely</b>
<b>finished weird tattoo, though.</b>

38:11.123 --> 38:14.560
<b>- It's definitely a poorly drawn</b>
<b>design that's tattooed well.</b>

38:14.660 --> 38:17.863
<b>- I want to win,</b>
<b>and I want to battle Sausage.</b>

38:17.963 --> 38:22.001
<b>- If you make it through,</b>
<b>you've got to [bleep] swing.</b>

38:22.101 --> 38:23.369
<b>- Jime.</b>

38:23.469 --> 38:24.904
<b>- Your head stands out</b>
<b>as being legible</b>

38:25.004 --> 38:27.540
<b>but doesn't really fall under</b>
<b>the traditional Japanese style.</b>

38:27.673 --> 38:30.342
<b>- I think I hit a lot more</b>
<b>of the challenge</b>

38:30.443 --> 38:32.678
<b>by doing my style of drawing</b>
<b>than people doing</b>

38:32.711 --> 38:34.480
<b>more traditional of a drawing.</b>

38:34.580 --> 38:36.682
<b>Jime, today is Japanese,</b>
<b>and it's your job to know it.</b>

38:36.715 --> 38:37.483
<b>You got to study for the test.</b>

38:37.583 --> 38:41.420
<b>If not, I got to fail you.</b>

38:41.520 --> 38:43.456
<b>- Judges, it's time to decide</b>

38:43.556 --> 38:45.825
<b>who is going to be</b>
<b>packing their machines.</b>

38:45.925 --> 38:46.992
<b>Of the four that are down here,</b>

38:47.092 --> 38:49.829
<b>Matti's might be</b>
<b>the most legible of the four.</b>

38:49.929 --> 38:51.530
<b>- Because the actual application</b>

38:51.697 --> 38:53.299
<b>is still appealing to the eye.</b>

38:53.399 --> 38:55.267
<b>- And, Jime, I don't like</b>
<b>the composition,</b>

38:55.367 --> 38:56.635
<b>but I can still see it.</b>

38:56.735 --> 38:59.638
<b>- It's a bigger, simpler design,</b>
<b>and it's a smart move</b>

38:59.705 --> 39:01.640
<b>if you're not familiar</b>
<b>with the style to go simpler.</b>

39:01.707 --> 39:03.409
<b>And the people today</b>
<b>that went the most complex,</b>

39:03.509 --> 39:05.778
<b>it was hard to read.</b>

39:05.878 --> 39:08.159
<b>- Are we talking between Megan</b>
<b>Jean and Sausage right now?</b>

39:08.247 --> 39:09.915
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- For sure.</b>

39:10.015 --> 39:11.450
<b>Both have problems</b>
<b>with legibility.</b>

39:11.550 --> 39:14.253
<b>- As far as</b>
<b>a Japanese dragon goes,</b>

39:14.353 --> 39:15.654
<b>Megan, your execution's cleaner,</b>

39:15.754 --> 39:17.923
<b>but yours is really camouflaged.</b>

39:18.023 --> 39:19.825
<b>Sausage, I commend you</b>
<b>for the application</b>

39:19.925 --> 39:21.293
<b>and for everything that went in,</b>

39:21.393 --> 39:24.029
<b>but the anatomy failed you.</b>

39:24.130 --> 39:24.964
<b>- Final decision.</b>

39:25.064 --> 39:25.898
<b>- Megan's is falling</b>
<b>short for me.</b>

39:25.998 --> 39:28.000
<b>It's hard to tell</b>
<b>what's going on,</b>

39:28.100 --> 39:29.668
<b>and it doesn't hit the real,</b>
<b>traditional Japanese.</b>

39:29.702 --> 39:32.438
<b>- When I look</b>
<b>at Megan Jean's tattoo,</b>

39:32.538 --> 39:34.240
<b>it appears cleaner to me.</b>

39:34.340 --> 39:35.941
<b>My vote is for Sausage.</b>

39:36.041 --> 39:37.810
<b>Chris.</b>

39:43.249 --> 39:44.316
<b>- Megan Jean.</b>

39:44.416 --> 39:45.416
<b>- Okay.</b>

39:45.484 --> 39:46.986
<b>- The judges have decided.</b>

39:47.086 --> 39:50.990
<b>Megan Jean, you do not have</b>
<b>what it takes to be Ink Master.</b>

39:51.090 --> 39:52.090
<b>- Okay.</b>

39:52.158 --> 39:53.392
<b>- You're a great tattooer.</b>

39:53.492 --> 39:55.252
<b>In this season, we brought</b>
<b>back all the best,</b>

39:55.294 --> 39:56.395
<b>and you stood strong.</b>

39:56.495 --> 39:57.730
<b>- Honestly, it was</b>
<b>really, really close.</b>

39:57.830 --> 40:01.400
<b>- Megan Jean, please pack</b>
<b>your machines and close shop.</b>

40:01.500 --> 40:05.638
<b>♪</b>

40:05.704 --> 40:07.706

<b>I don't feel like I deserve</b>
<b>to be going home.</b>

40:08.741 --> 40:11.644

40:14.146 --> 40:14.880
