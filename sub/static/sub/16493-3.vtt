We've got class.

We're gonna climb right up your glass!

00:50.834 --> 00:53.583
Go, Geckos!

00:53.667 --> 00:56.667
I never understood why people
need a rally to get peppy.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.000
Does that make you feel peppier?

00:58.750 --> 01:00.291
[groaning]

01:00.375 --> 01:01.875
Yeah, it kinda does.

01:01.959 --> 01:04.542
Oh, hey, Melissa.
Mind if I join you?

01:04.625 --> 01:06.417
Sure, Bradley, have a seat.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.458
[grunting]

01:08.542 --> 01:10.625
-Hello, Milo.
-Hi, Bradley.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.959
[clears throat] All right listen
up, Geckos.

01:15.041 --> 01:17.000
[sighs] I'm not
gonna lie to you.

01:17.083 --> 01:20.542
We're gonna lose today
and we're gonna lose hard.

01:20.625 --> 01:22.959
Middletown Middle School
has intentionally failed

01:23.041 --> 01:26.250
all its best eighth grade players
for six years straight now,

01:26.333 --> 01:27.333
so we're basically playing

01:27.417 --> 01:29.458
against a group of angry adults.

01:29.542 --> 01:31.959
We'll be lucky if we make it
out of there with all our limbs.

01:32.041 --> 01:33.792
But that's no reason
not to get out there

01:33.875 --> 01:36.333
-and give it the old middle school try!
-It isn't?

01:36.417 --> 01:40.458
If you need me,
I'll be in my office staring into space.

01:40.542 --> 01:43.875
Oh, yeah, and in the meantime,
let's enjoy some peppy songs

01:43.959 --> 01:47.458
from our Jefferson County Middle
School defunded marching band.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.875
[playing out of tune]

01:49.959 --> 01:51.875
Now that makes me feel peppy.

01:51.959 --> 01:54.709
No, Milo, don't tap.
Remember what happened last time?

01:54.792 --> 01:55.875
[Milo] What happened last time?

01:55.959 --> 01:57.166
[all yelling]

01:57.250 --> 01:58.667
Oh, now I remember.

01:58.750 --> 02:00.667
[Melissa] Dude, you're on my didgeridoo.

02:00.750 --> 02:04.208
You guys are coming, right?
It is my first game as part of the team.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.709
Oh, my gecko, I would love to.
I haven't been in years.

02:07.792 --> 02:09.500
Last time he came,
there was a llama stampede.

02:09.583 --> 02:10.917
Llama stampede?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.750
You know, they can spit 15 feet.

02:12.834 --> 02:14.458
I haven't been to a game since.

02:14.542 --> 02:17.000
I do get nice thank you
notes from the team, though.

02:17.083 --> 02:19.750
You know, for staying away.

Milo and I have had a "Not Football
Friday" tradition for years.

02:28.417 --> 02:30.083
"Not Football Friday"?

02:30.166 --> 02:32.083
Yep. We used to bowl, but now we do things

02:32.166 --> 02:35.250
without dangerously heavy round objects.
Like, play cards.

02:36.959 --> 02:39.041
[gorilla grunting]

02:39.125 --> 02:41.083
It's still safer than bowling!

But it's my first game, guys.

02:49.250 --> 02:53.041
It sounds fun, but I try to
support the team by staying away.

02:53.125 --> 02:55.041
Hey, Milo, Coach said you
could come to this game,

02:55.125 --> 02:56.875
'cause it's the one game you can't ruin,

02:56.959 --> 02:58.208
on account of we're gonna lose.

02:58.291 --> 03:00.083
-Really? Oh, yeah.
-They're better than us.

03:00.125 --> 03:02.792
Plus, I've got a blockage
in my fourth chakra.

03:02.875 --> 03:05.917
Can't argue with a blocked chakra.
I'm going!

03:10.083 --> 03:12.125
Sorry, Mort!

03:12.208 --> 03:14.917
No, I don't think that was Murphy's Law.
I think that was my chakra.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.834
[Milo] This is gonna be awesome.

03:16.917 --> 03:18.959
You know how they say the
twelfth man is the crowd?

03:19.041 --> 03:20.792
Well, I'm 12.5!

03:20.875 --> 03:23.125
Whoo! It's the wave!

03:23.208 --> 03:24.959
'Course, it works better
with the whole crowd.

03:25.041 --> 03:27.208
Are you sure you wanna go to this game?

03:27.291 --> 03:31.083
'Cause we could go to the empty
pistachio warehouse and explore.

03:31.166 --> 03:34.125
It's Zack's first game
and they're gonna lose.

03:34.208 --> 03:35.542
It'll be great!

04:00.792 --> 04:04.166
Oh, sorry, Diogee. No dogs at the
football game. You have to stay home.

[doorbell rings]

04:09.959 --> 04:11.417

04:18.917 --> 04:20.959

04:21.041 --> 04:22.166

Hey, Milo. I just got the
cast off from last time.

04:58.125 --> 05:00.750
Hi, Principal Milder. Melissa. Milo?

05:00.834 --> 05:02.667
-[chuckles] Good to see ya.
-[groans]

05:02.750 --> 05:05.208
I was under the impression
you promised Coach Mitchell

05:05.250 --> 05:06.667
you would never show up at a game.

05:06.750 --> 05:08.667
No, it's okay,
'cause we're gonna lose anyway.

05:08.750 --> 05:10.083
The coach said so at the pep rally.

05:10.166 --> 05:14.083
Did he? I'm gonna have to
explain "pep" to that man.

05:14.166 --> 05:16.625
Oh, look, there's the band! Hi, band!

Hey, Melissa, you can sit with
us if you value your life.

05:29.291 --> 05:31.125
We're outside the splatter zone.

05:31.208 --> 05:33.750
No thanks. I've got an
adequate buffer zone here.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.917
Hey! Do you mind?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.208
Oh, Diogee. You should go home.

-Oh, I'll take two.

06:17.250 --> 06:18.375
Sorry, we are closed.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.750
Wow, French food at a football game?

06:20.834 --> 06:23.250
They tried selling German
sausages but they were the worst.

06:23.333 --> 06:25.083
[drum roll]

06:25.166 --> 06:26.917
Check it out! I found a snare drum!

06:31.250 --> 06:33.291
If he can't do it... Look out!

06:33.375 --> 06:36.625
Creme brulee. Get your creme brulee. Ooh!

06:36.709 --> 06:38.417
That was probably my bad.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.125
That should count for something.

06:40.208 --> 06:41.750
We could still win.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.875
You know, if the Tigers all suddenly
came down with a really bad cold

06:43.959 --> 06:45.291
or if they suddenly decided

06:45.375 --> 06:47.291
they wanted to be folk musicians
instead of athletes or...

06:47.375 --> 06:48.667
You know, you can stop me any time.

06:48.750 --> 06:51.583
Yeah! Who would've guessed
the game would be ruined?

06:51.667 --> 06:54.125
Color me surprised. Hmm.

06:54.208 --> 06:56.583
What's the one thing that's
different at this game?

06:56.667 --> 06:58.834
I don't know. I'm not usually here.

06:58.917 --> 07:01.667
Maybe things would've gone better
if you'd cheered for the other team.

07:01.750 --> 07:04.417
Yeah. [chuckles] Go Tigers!

listen to you starting now

us not to listen to you?
