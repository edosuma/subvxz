00:00.168 --> 00:02.027
Previously, on "The Path"...

00:02.028 --> 00:03.097
- Where were you?
- Can we talk about this alone?

00:03.098 --> 00:04.127
He's been seeing a girl.

00:04.128 --> 00:05.967
- What girl?
- An IS girl.

00:05.968 --> 00:07.127
You need to deal with this, Sarah.

00:07.128 --> 00:09.097
You don't know what it's
like to lose a child.

00:09.098 --> 00:11.097
Go up to your room, and
we'll handle this later.

00:11.098 --> 00:13.027
Is that where you were, with an IS?

00:13.028 --> 00:15.047
Hawk says he doesn't
want to leave school.

00:15.048 --> 00:17.117
It's exactly what had
happened with Tessa.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.017
She was almost 16.

00:19.018 --> 00:21.157
- Let me pray with you.
- Alison Kemp?

00:21.158 --> 00:24.057
And how are you so certain your
husband didn't kill himself?

00:24.058 --> 00:25.967
On the morning that he jumped

00:25.968 --> 00:27.167
he told me he was having doubts.

00:27.168 --> 00:28.977
Jason and Alison Kemp.

00:28.978 --> 00:32.067
Check it out. Lima, Lima, Lima.

00:32.067 --> 00:33.167
Feels like trafficking to me.

00:33.168 --> 00:36.017
Your wife and son are in Peru.

00:36.018 --> 00:37.087
My wife is a desperate woman.

00:37.088 --> 00:38.947
You prey on people like that.

00:38.948 --> 00:41.047
My colleague is a fucking angel,

00:41.048 --> 00:43.147
and you are lucky your son
crossed paths with her.

00:43.148 --> 00:45.117
Get the fuck out of my house!

01:44.958 --> 01:46.157
John Ridge did this to you?

01:46.158 --> 01:50.037
He has a guy who does it for him.

01:50.038 --> 01:52.987
This is all my fault. I am so, so...

01:52.988 --> 01:54.068
No.

01:56.068 --> 01:58.137
You got me to do the right thing.

01:58.138 --> 02:00.017
I'm gonna have to give
you a butterfly stitch.

02:00.018 --> 02:01.168
I'll be right back.

02:09.088 --> 02:11.008
You look terrible.

02:34.058 --> 02:36.137
Boko Haram has claimed responsibility

02:36.138 --> 02:38.137
for the 18 missing schoolgirls.

02:38.138 --> 02:41.167
In local news, yesterday, in
Harmon, upstate New York...

02:41.168 --> 02:43.087
That's right near us.

02:43.088 --> 02:46.157
A factory that makes gift
boxes was raided by ICE.

02:46.158 --> 02:49.087
Over 40 illegal workers were arrested.

02:49.088 --> 02:50.997
Many of the workers had children

02:50.998 --> 02:52.987
who were born in the United States.

02:52.988 --> 02:55.087
Such a disgrace to separate families.

02:55.088 --> 02:57.017
Local Church of the Sacred
Heart is providing refuge

02:57.018 --> 02:58.967
for three of the workers
and their children,

02:58.968 --> 03:00.087
although they're expected
to comply with ICE

03:00.088 --> 03:02.077
and turn over the families
to local authorities.

03:02.078 --> 03:03.977
And then they have no backbone.

03:03.978 --> 03:05.987
Well, that's organized
religion for you.

03:05.988 --> 03:08.007
You know, good intentions

03:08.008 --> 03:10.988
but no follow-through.

03:42.118 --> 03:44.137
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:44.138 --> 03:46.057
You need that car?

03:46.058 --> 03:47.137
Uh, no, you can take it.

03:47.138 --> 03:49.057
Everything okay?

03:51.048 --> 03:52.997
Just some UR business with a Denier.

03:52.998 --> 03:55.147
You need some help with that, Cal?

03:55.148 --> 03:57.018
'Cause I'd love to come.

04:09.168 --> 04:11.938
Should I take my shirt off?

04:14.138 --> 04:16.028
What?

04:21.017 --> 04:22.987
Hawk, you can't keep hating yourself

04:22.988 --> 04:26.127
for the way that you feel about me.

04:26.128 --> 04:28.077
It's just, I'm...

04:28.078 --> 04:29.977
What?

04:29.978 --> 04:34.027
What if this isn't real and...

04:34.028 --> 04:38.017
I'm ruining my whole life?

04:38.018 --> 04:41.947
Hawk, it's not gonna be
real if we keep hiding

04:41.948 --> 04:44.097
or if you, like, can't
tell your parents about me

04:44.098 --> 04:47.938
or if you have to plant ten
trees every time we make out.

04:52.168 --> 04:54.167
You think my parents found
out I'm still seeing you?

04:54.168 --> 04:55.967
I don't know.

04:58.148 --> 05:00.097
Ma'am, I'm afraid you've
had 72 hours notice.

05:00.098 --> 05:02.017
I have two children.

05:02.018 --> 05:03.087
You have ten minutes to
evacuate the property.

05:03.088 --> 05:04.937
Where am I gonna go with two kids...

05:04.938 --> 05:06.027
If you don't evacuate the property,

05:06.028 --> 05:08.007
I'll have to forcibly remove you.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.117
What's happening, Mommy?

05:09.118 --> 05:11.947
We are... we are not leaving our home.

05:11.948 --> 05:13.067
- It's not your home, Ma'am.
- Mom, we should listen to him.

05:13.068 --> 05:14.167
Zak, we're gonna get your stuff, okay?

05:14.168 --> 05:16.057
I told the bank I would get the money.

05:16.058 --> 05:17.147
Mom, stop fighting.
Don't be an asshole.

05:17.148 --> 05:19.057
You should listen to your daughter.

05:19.058 --> 05:21.027
Otherwise, I'm gonna be
forced to take you in

05:21.028 --> 05:23.027
and turn your children over
to Protective Services.

05:23.028 --> 05:24.117
We're gonna go get your stuff

05:24.118 --> 05:25.947
and get your schoolbooks

05:25.948 --> 05:29.077
and get some clothes, okay?

05:37.448 --> 05:39.577
So what exactly are we doing?

05:39.578 --> 05:41.477
The higher you climb,

05:41.478 --> 05:44.447
the more The Movement asks of you.

05:44.448 --> 05:45.617
Sometimes it isn't pleasant,

05:45.618 --> 05:47.598
but it's for the greater good.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.457
You took quite a beating.

05:53.458 --> 05:54.607
Yeah, well, it's a perfect example.

05:54.608 --> 05:56.587
It wasn't fun to get the
shit kicked out of me,

05:56.588 --> 06:00.648
but it was for the right thing.

06:23.478 --> 06:27.597
Whatever happens today,
keep it between us.

06:54.598 --> 06:56.558
They need our help.

07:02.578 --> 07:04.477
Does this mean you've been seeing her

07:04.478 --> 07:07.607
and lying to us the whole time?

07:07.608 --> 07:11.497
We're just friends, Mom.

07:11.498 --> 07:13.507
They'll find someplace
else to go, but it...

07:13.508 --> 07:15.488
it might take a couple days.

07:18.508 --> 07:20.488
We're supposed to help people.

07:24.438 --> 07:26.628
You raised me to believe that.

07:29.538 --> 07:30.607
Okay.

07:30.608 --> 07:32.587
Thank you.

07:32.588 --> 07:36.567
Um, one other thing.

07:36.568 --> 07:38.567
Could we be a little low-key

07:38.568 --> 07:40.567
with the Movement thing around them?

07:40.568 --> 07:42.617
You can't be ashamed of who you are.

07:42.618 --> 07:44.617
I'm not, it's just...

07:44.618 --> 07:49.537
it's... freaks her mom out.

07:49.538 --> 07:52.518
Please.

08:17.518 --> 08:19.637
So, uh, what are we doing here?

08:19.638 --> 08:21.668
Looking for something.

08:25.468 --> 08:26.647
How did you get a key?

08:26.648 --> 08:29.447
I rented it for 10 bucks
from the front desk.

08:29.448 --> 08:30.647
Got to love America.

08:30.648 --> 08:33.547
So what are we looking for?

08:33.548 --> 08:35.616
Why don't you make sure there
isn't anybody hiding in here?

08:35.618 --> 08:37.578
Just check the bathroom.

08:47.548 --> 08:50.567
Nope. So, uh, who's staying here?

08:50.568 --> 08:52.548
What did they do?

08:55.468 --> 08:58.467
Stole $40,000 from the
center in San Diego.

08:58.468 --> 09:01.448
Why don't you check the balcony?

09:07.648 --> 09:11.437
Please.

09:25.448 --> 09:27.458
Nothing.

09:31.508 --> 09:33.437
Mm, yeah.

09:33.438 --> 09:34.567
Mommy and Daddy are gonna
give you a little treatment.

09:35.568 --> 09:37.517
Babe, can you bring the
mouth thing over here?

09:37.518 --> 09:40.457
Yeah, give me a second. This
thing is all twisted up.

09:40.458 --> 09:42.577
Okay, sweetie.

09:42.578 --> 09:45.497
It's gonna make you
feel so much better.

09:45.498 --> 09:47.497
- God, I hate this.
- Well...

09:47.498 --> 09:49.497
We should've just done the operation.

09:49.498 --> 09:52.567
The doctor said give her the
medication for a few weeks.

09:52.568 --> 09:55.547
The ductus arteriosus might
close up on its own.

09:55.548 --> 09:57.547
Oh, someone's been researching.

09:59.558 --> 10:01.657
I'm gonna put this over
your mouth, okay, Lucy-Lou?

10:01.658 --> 10:03.617
- Okay.
- All right.

10:03.618 --> 10:04.667
Good girl.

10:04.668 --> 10:06.487
- Okay.
- Good girl.

10:06.488 --> 10:08.437
Okay.

10:08.438 --> 10:09.547
We should've moved.

10:09.548 --> 10:12.557
The house didn't make her a preemie,

10:12.558 --> 10:14.477
and it didn't cause her PDA.

10:14.478 --> 10:16.437
But Sandy might have.

10:16.438 --> 10:18.557
All the toxins and stuff, pollution,

10:18.558 --> 10:21.517
and the other kids were
healthy, full-term.

10:21.518 --> 10:22.637
Jack was two weeks late.

10:22.638 --> 10:24.637
Ah, it wasn't the storm either.

10:24.638 --> 10:27.667
Anyway, everything is gonna be fine.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.527
I know it is.

10:29.528 --> 10:32.517
How do you know?

10:32.518 --> 10:36.467
I saw it when I looked in the light.

10:36.468 --> 10:37.657
You're not using this, are you?

10:37.658 --> 10:40.487
I mean, to get in with the cult people.

10:40.488 --> 10:41.597
You're not using our baby?

10:46.498 --> 10:48.597
I thought you and Zak
could take this room.

10:48.598 --> 10:51.607
Ashley can have the couch.

10:51.608 --> 10:53.577
We don't have a lot of room.

10:53.578 --> 10:55.657
You know, if this is
too much trouble...

10:55.658 --> 10:58.547
No, of course not.

10:58.548 --> 11:00.588
Thank you.

11:11.468 --> 11:13.537
- Do you see Hawk a lot?
- What?

11:13.538 --> 11:17.497
Does he come to your house often?

11:17.498 --> 11:19.627
Once in a while.

11:19.628 --> 11:22.657
Zak wants to try the M Machine.

11:22.658 --> 11:25.447
What is the M Machine?

11:25.448 --> 11:26.547
It's electrostimulation.

11:26.548 --> 11:27.607
We use it for a lot of things.

11:27.608 --> 11:29.477
It's great for stress.

11:29.478 --> 11:30.557
- I want to try it.
- It's a machine?

11:30.558 --> 11:33.527
Yeah.

11:33.528 --> 11:36.647
It's great for their immune system.

11:36.648 --> 11:37.667
It tickles.

11:37.668 --> 11:39.497
It does tickle.

11:39.498 --> 11:40.657
I don't think so.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.587
- But I want to.
- No.

11:42.588 --> 11:45.627
You know, Meg's not
comfortable with that,

11:45.628 --> 11:47.567
so why don't we find
something else to do, huh?

11:47.568 --> 11:48.667
It's just,

11:48.668 --> 11:50.587
I'm not a very religious person, so...

11:50.588 --> 11:53.447
Why don't you finish

11:53.448 --> 11:54.447
getting settled in?

11:54.448 --> 11:56.447
We forage on Friday,

11:56.448 --> 11:58.477
so you can just go ahead
and help yourself

11:58.478 --> 11:59.537
to whatever you find in the cabinets

11:59.538 --> 12:01.477
or the refrigerator.

12:01.478 --> 12:02.637
Thank you.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.618
You're so kind.

12:07.438 --> 12:09.457
So where am I sleeping?

12:09.458 --> 12:11.457
With us.

12:11.458 --> 12:13.438
A sleepover!

12:23.538 --> 12:26.647
Yes?

12:26.648 --> 12:30.457
Kemp never came back to The Pine Wood.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.507
She doesn't usually go far.

12:32.508 --> 12:34.637
We'll keep looking.

12:34.638 --> 12:36.527
I don't get it.

12:36.528 --> 12:38.437
If I was her, I'd be
hiding out in Mexico,

12:38.438 --> 12:40.527
not 2 miles from the people
she stole money from.

12:40.528 --> 12:41.577
You know, I keep thinking it means

12:41.578 --> 12:43.667
she wants to be found.

12:43.668 --> 12:48.567
You know, she wants help in some way.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.647
Sit down. I was about to make tea.

12:50.648 --> 12:53.487
Uh, I got to get home.

12:53.488 --> 12:54.587
Wife and kids.

12:54.588 --> 12:56.467
All right.

12:58.468 --> 13:01.637
Her husband killed himself, you know?

13:01.638 --> 13:04.627
Alison's.

13:04.628 --> 13:08.487
I heard that.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.578
I imagine she's in a lot of pain.

13:16.558 --> 13:18.637
You know, maybe we've been
going about this wrong.

13:18.638 --> 13:20.557
We've been so eager to
get our money back,

13:20.558 --> 13:25.457
but maybe if we stop pushing her,

13:25.458 --> 13:26.657
she'll come to us.

13:26.658 --> 13:28.657
You want me to stop looking for her?

13:28.658 --> 13:30.637
No, no, no. Just, you know,

13:30.638 --> 13:33.537
next time we find her,
we'll alter our approach.

13:33.538 --> 13:35.627
Okay.

13:35.628 --> 13:37.527
Good night.

13:37.528 --> 13:40.457
Unless there's something...

13:40.458 --> 13:41.537
No, no, no, go home.

13:41.538 --> 13:43.598
Enjoy your family.

14:14.618 --> 14:17.457
Can we have lots of stories

14:17.458 --> 14:21.487
and stay up very, very late?

14:21.488 --> 14:23.538
She's never gonna sleep.

14:25.478 --> 14:28.577
Hey, I'm upset too.

14:28.578 --> 14:30.537
I think he was seeing her

14:30.538 --> 14:32.467
the whole time he was
telling us he wasn't.

14:32.468 --> 14:33.637
Let me talk to Hawk about this.

14:33.638 --> 14:35.447
I tried.

14:35.448 --> 14:36.537
He literally came into the chapel

14:36.538 --> 14:37.627
and said that his friends needed help,

14:37.628 --> 14:39.447
and they were standing outside

14:39.448 --> 14:41.437
with their suitcases.

14:41.438 --> 14:43.477
Is Hawk in trouble?

14:43.478 --> 14:44.607
No, honey.

14:44.608 --> 14:47.497
Mommy and Daddy are having
some grown-up time.

14:47.498 --> 14:49.517
Is Ashley the girl

14:49.518 --> 14:50.667
who wants to take Hawk away from us?

14:50.668 --> 14:53.637
- Where did you hear that?
- Joy.

14:53.638 --> 14:56.567
You've got to talk to Nicole.

14:56.568 --> 14:57.667
No, honey.

14:57.668 --> 15:00.597
No one's gonna take Hawk away from us.

15:00.598 --> 15:03.497
Now get under the covers
and do your G & I,

15:03.498 --> 15:07.577
and then I will read you three stories.

15:07.578 --> 15:10.547
I have gratitude for my mom

15:10.548 --> 15:13.507
and my dad and Hawk

15:13.508 --> 15:16.657
and the rest of my family
and my new friend, Zak.

15:16.658 --> 15:19.527
Look, we just need to talk to Hawk

15:19.528 --> 15:21.507
before we jump to conclusions

15:21.508 --> 15:23.447
- about what's going on.
- Why do you insist

15:23.448 --> 15:24.617
on being so naive about this?

15:24.618 --> 15:26.627
I'm not naive. I'm just
sick of pretending

15:26.628 --> 15:29.467
that we know the truth when maybe

15:29.468 --> 15:31.567
we don't have a fucking clue.

15:31.568 --> 15:34.497
What does that mean?

15:34.498 --> 15:35.557
Are you guys fighting?

15:35.558 --> 15:36.637
No, we're not fighting.

15:36.638 --> 15:39.487
I just...

15:47.568 --> 15:48.667
Hi.

15:48.668 --> 15:51.587
Hi. Didn't mean to interrupt.

15:51.588 --> 15:53.597
- You weren't.
- We were just talking.

15:53.598 --> 15:55.578
Did you need me, Cal?

15:57.648 --> 16:00.577
No. No.

16:00.578 --> 16:04.517
Actually, I was looking for Sean.

16:04.518 --> 16:08.647
I need a good man on
the ground in Milton.

16:08.648 --> 16:11.577
- We're opening an office there.
- Milton?

16:11.578 --> 16:15.447
It's... it's in Delaware.

16:15.448 --> 16:18.577
Um... okay.

16:43.568 --> 16:46.547
Hey.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.627
Mm, I can't sleep either.

16:48.628 --> 16:52.567
I know it's a tense situation,

16:52.568 --> 16:55.637
but maybe it's a good thing

16:55.638 --> 16:58.597
Ashley and her family are here.

16:58.598 --> 17:02.668
At least nothing's happening
behind our backs.

17:07.498 --> 17:11.467
You know that work that
Cal and I did earlier?

17:11.468 --> 17:14.497
Yeah.

17:14.498 --> 17:19.446
We went to a cheap motel

17:19.448 --> 17:22.458
and basically broke into a room.

17:24.518 --> 17:29.547
Cal was looking for somebody

17:29.548 --> 17:31.507
who apparently stole a bunch of money

17:31.508 --> 17:32.657
from the center in San Diego.

17:32.658 --> 17:34.507
Do you know anything about this?

17:34.508 --> 17:35.597
No.

17:35.598 --> 17:37.477
Yeah, I mean,

17:37.478 --> 17:39.597
they ended up not being there,

17:39.598 --> 17:41.667
but what if they were?

17:41.668 --> 17:44.667
I mean, what were...
what were we gonna do?

17:44.668 --> 17:50.657
What, like, threaten them
for the money or hurt them?

17:50.658 --> 17:54.497
We don't hurt people.

17:54.498 --> 17:56.478
You sure about that?

17:58.568 --> 18:02.567
Because it sure seemed
like something serious

18:02.568 --> 18:05.547
was gonna go down if someone was there.

18:05.548 --> 18:09.467
Eddie, that's insane.

18:09.468 --> 18:10.657
Is it?

18:10.658 --> 18:15.597
Because I don't know.

18:15.598 --> 18:19.437
Maybe that's what we do,

18:19.438 --> 18:23.458
hurt people, now that Cal's in charge.

18:25.468 --> 18:27.567
No, we don't.

18:52.538 --> 18:54.477
Morning.

18:54.478 --> 18:56.507
Eddie told me about yesterday.

18:56.508 --> 18:58.467
Of course he did.

18:58.468 --> 19:00.467
What were you doing?

19:00.468 --> 19:01.607
You heard of Alison Kemp?

19:01.608 --> 19:03.517
Vaguely, from our San Diego Center.

19:03.518 --> 19:04.537
Her husband took his life.

19:04.538 --> 19:06.477
And she stole $40,000 from us.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.547
I was trying to get it back.

19:07.548 --> 19:09.657
By breaking into a room?

19:09.658 --> 19:12.517
What would you have
done if she was there?

19:12.518 --> 19:14.447
I'm trying to run things here, Sarah.

19:14.448 --> 19:16.507
I'm not gonna let people think
they can steal from us.

19:16.508 --> 19:17.597
Breaking into rooms and
intimidating people

19:17.598 --> 19:19.507
is not who we are.

19:19.508 --> 19:20.657
No, we're also not an
organization that can

19:20.658 --> 19:23.567
afford to let a Denier
walk off with 40 grand.

19:23.568 --> 19:26.487
Believe me, the last thing I
want is to bang on doors,

19:26.488 --> 19:28.467
but if we send the message
that people can just

19:28.468 --> 19:30.447
walk into our house and rob it,

19:30.448 --> 19:32.487
we not only lose every
ounce of dignity,

19:32.488 --> 19:34.437
but the very limited resources we have

19:34.438 --> 19:36.537
to do good in the world.

19:36.538 --> 19:39.487
Her husband committed suicide, Cal.

19:39.488 --> 19:41.657
Screw the money.

19:56.498 --> 19:58.437
Where do we keep the Denier files?

19:58.438 --> 20:00.487
I hear you have that girl's
family at your house.

20:00.488 --> 20:02.527
What's going on? Is
Hawk still seeing her?

20:02.528 --> 20:05.497
I don't know, I'm just
trying to figure it out.

20:05.498 --> 20:07.537
I need to see a whole file on someone.

20:07.538 --> 20:09.518
You need a key.

20:11.508 --> 20:14.488
- Thank you.
- It's that.

20:20.538 --> 20:22.477
Who are you looking for?

20:22.478 --> 20:23.577
Alison Kemp.

20:23.578 --> 20:25.577
I took too long trying to

20:25.578 --> 20:27.607
figure it out with Tessa.

20:27.608 --> 20:29.507
Your dad knew.

20:29.508 --> 20:34.577
He tried to get me to
do something, but I...

20:34.578 --> 20:38.527
I had this faith that
Light would win out,

20:38.528 --> 20:41.628
and now it's been almost 20 years.

20:47.468 --> 20:48.567
Can you get me a new folder?

20:48.568 --> 20:50.637
This one's damaged.

20:59.478 --> 21:00.577
New folder.

21:00.578 --> 21:02.558
Thank you.

21:04.658 --> 21:06.638
Key.

21:15.628 --> 21:19.637
♪ She wore blue velvet ♪

21:19.638 --> 21:23.517
Hey.

21:23.518 --> 21:24.587
You sure you weren't followed?

21:24.588 --> 21:26.437
Pretty sure.

21:26.438 --> 21:28.577
Thanks for coming.

21:28.578 --> 21:31.577
Thanks for not giving me up to Cal.

21:31.578 --> 21:35.438
Why didn't you tell me about
the 40 grand you stole?

21:36.528 --> 21:37.587
I didn't think it was relevant.

21:37.588 --> 21:39.467
Really?

21:39.468 --> 21:41.447
'Cause you told me they
were following you

21:41.448 --> 21:42.607
because they killed your husband

21:42.608 --> 21:43.657
'cause you wanted to leave.

21:43.658 --> 21:47.527
Seems pretty fucking relevant.

21:47.528 --> 21:49.487
I'm sorry.

21:49.488 --> 21:52.488
I thought it would
hurt my case with you.

21:54.588 --> 21:55.667
So where's the money?

21:55.668 --> 21:57.517
Is that why you're here?

21:57.518 --> 21:58.637
To get the money back from me?

21:58.638 --> 22:01.508
No, I just want to know the truth.

22:06.508 --> 22:09.487
There was 40 grand in my bank
account when Jason died.

22:09.488 --> 22:11.487
Granted, yes, it was theirs,

22:11.488 --> 22:12.627
but it was in my account,

22:12.628 --> 22:15.457
and I felt that I had
the right to take it.

22:15.458 --> 22:17.457
Okay, what was it doing there?

22:17.458 --> 22:19.437
They were always putting money in

22:19.438 --> 22:20.587
for his missions in Peru.

22:20.588 --> 22:22.657
And what kind of missions?

22:22.658 --> 22:24.597
I don't know.

22:24.598 --> 22:27.537
I mean, was it good missions
like cleft palates,

22:27.538 --> 22:29.637
helping the poor, or bad shit?

22:29.638 --> 22:31.487
What are you asking me, Eddie?

22:31.488 --> 22:33.587
I'm asking if we are good.

22:33.588 --> 22:36.538
If we are good people doing
good things for this world.

22:42.658 --> 22:45.527
Jason was good.

22:45.528 --> 22:47.537
I know that.

22:47.538 --> 22:51.507
I know he wouldn't have
done bad things to people,

22:51.508 --> 22:55.437
so whatever it is that he was
doing, I know it was good.

22:55.438 --> 22:56.567
Did you ever go to Peru with him?

22:56.568 --> 22:57.627
A few times.

22:57.628 --> 23:00.557
And you saw him doing these things

23:00.558 --> 23:01.617
like feeding the poor?

23:01.618 --> 23:03.507
Yeah, taking care of sick people.

23:03.508 --> 23:05.498
I did.

23:08.478 --> 23:11.457
That's good.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.537
That's great.

23:13.538 --> 23:16.487
That helps because, you know,

23:16.488 --> 23:21.467
I have tried... am trying.

23:21.468 --> 23:25.467
Doing everything to be back in,

23:25.468 --> 23:28.557
to believe that what
we are doing is right,

23:28.558 --> 23:30.567
but I don't know.

23:30.568 --> 23:32.627
Ever since Peru, since the medicine,

23:32.628 --> 23:38.527
since meeting you, I'm just...

23:38.528 --> 23:41.527
I'm just messed up.

23:42.588 --> 23:44.587
Once you see the first crack,

23:44.588 --> 23:47.477
you begin to realize
it's cracked all over.

23:47.478 --> 23:49.657
It's like my grandpa used to say,

23:49.658 --> 23:52.457
"Once you've seen the freak
show, you can't unsee it."

23:52.458 --> 23:56.577
Yeah, well, I don't
want to see the cracks.

23:56.578 --> 23:59.587
Okay, I don't have that luxury.

23:59.588 --> 24:02.447
I just have to be
vigilant about the work

24:02.448 --> 24:05.578
and stay on top of it.

24:08.538 --> 24:12.507
I mean, why don't you
just get out of here,

24:12.508 --> 24:14.588
you know, get the hell away from us?

24:19.448 --> 24:21.608
I was the one that brought
him into The Movement.

24:24.448 --> 24:27.637
It's my fault.

24:27.638 --> 24:29.618
He didn't kill himself.

24:36.548 --> 24:38.648
Stay safe, Alison.

24:43.568 --> 24:46.567
You can't fake belief, you know?

24:59.548 --> 25:03.487
Jason could've been
the top of his field.

25:03.488 --> 25:05.477
He was first of his class at Yale.

25:05.478 --> 25:07.667
He was a great doctor.

25:07.668 --> 25:10.518
Could have been a great doctor.

25:12.528 --> 25:17.457
His widow, Alison, doesn't
believe he committed suicide.

25:17.458 --> 25:19.487
That's because she killed him.

25:19.488 --> 25:22.587
She... she got him involved
in that crazy cult.

25:22.588 --> 25:24.607
He wouldn't speak to us once he joined.

25:24.608 --> 25:29.507
We were, um... Ignorant Systemites.

25:29.508 --> 25:32.537
Systemites?

25:32.538 --> 25:35.527
You hadn't spoken to your
son in years when he died.

25:35.528 --> 25:40.477
Strangely, he called a month bef...

25:40.478 --> 25:43.467
He asked for a colleague's
phone number,

25:43.468 --> 25:44.647
Dr. Alan Rothstein.

25:44.648 --> 25:48.467
He's a researcher at Stanford.

25:48.468 --> 25:50.668
And what did your son want
with Dr. Rothstein?

25:53.438 --> 25:56.587
I didn't ask questions.

25:56.588 --> 26:00.447
I don't know, somewhere I had
this hope, this stupid hope

26:00.448 --> 26:05.597
that the call was a sign
that he wanted out, that...

26:05.598 --> 26:11.557
to come back, to be a real doctor,

26:11.558 --> 26:16.507
and I didn't want to push.

26:16.508 --> 26:19.517
Next thing I knew, he was dead.

26:40.438 --> 26:41.607
Come on, hurry up.

26:41.608 --> 26:44.477
Come on, we're gonna
be late for karate.

30:40.668 --> 30:43.497
I have something to say to you.

30:43.498 --> 30:45.607
Apparently, the whole Lane family does.

30:45.608 --> 30:48.507
Look, I am here for a reason,

30:48.508 --> 30:50.447
and I want to stay here,

30:50.448 --> 30:54.457
but I'm not doing shit
like we did the other day.

30:54.458 --> 30:55.557
Okay?

30:55.558 --> 30:56.607
Because if that's the kind of thing

30:56.608 --> 30:59.647
that goes on around here,

30:59.648 --> 31:01.517
I'm done.

31:01.518 --> 31:05.497
Understood.

31:05.498 --> 31:08.667
I was a man who followed orders

31:08.668 --> 31:11.667
for a long time,

31:11.668 --> 31:14.627
and now I've been put in charge,

31:14.628 --> 31:20.528
and I will make mistakes.

31:23.508 --> 31:24.557
All right.

31:24.558 --> 31:26.667
You want some tea?

31:26.668 --> 31:30.437
No, I got, uh... I got dinner.

31:30.438 --> 31:32.587
You know, Hawk has
brought his girlfriend

31:32.588 --> 31:35.497
and her family to stay with us.

31:35.498 --> 31:36.647
They got evicted.

31:36.648 --> 31:39.537
It's a whole crazy situation,

31:39.538 --> 31:41.467
but, um, next time.

31:41.468 --> 31:42.597
All right, well, if there's
anything I can do...

31:42.598 --> 31:44.517
Yeah, no, I think we're gonna be...

31:44.518 --> 31:46.537
we're gonna be fine,

31:46.538 --> 31:47.637
but if you want to do something,

31:47.638 --> 31:49.457
turn on the radio.

31:49.458 --> 31:50.507
Check out what's going on

31:50.508 --> 31:51.607
with the nuns down at Sacred Heart.

31:51.608 --> 31:53.598
It's all fucked.

31:56.498 --> 31:59.528
It is fucked.

32:24.548 --> 32:26.537
- Grandpa.
- Hm?

32:26.538 --> 32:28.587
Could you...

32:28.588 --> 32:30.568
What's up?

32:35.568 --> 32:37.617
Nothing.

32:37.618 --> 32:40.467
Okay.

32:40.468 --> 32:41.657
Is your grandpa smoking pot?

32:41.658 --> 32:44.497
It's sacred herb.

32:44.498 --> 32:45.667
It's not for recreation.

32:45.668 --> 32:47.637
It's a medicinal compound that provides

32:47.638 --> 32:49.577
a superhighway to deeper consciousness.

32:54.438 --> 32:55.617
Hey, would you mind taking

32:55.618 --> 32:58.487
some of that stuff over to the table?

32:58.488 --> 32:59.517
Thanks.

32:59.518 --> 33:00.577
Hey.

33:00.578 --> 33:02.547
Uh, sorry I'm late.

33:02.548 --> 33:03.597
Where were you?

33:03.598 --> 33:05.557
I got held up at work.

33:05.558 --> 33:06.617
How was your day?

33:06.618 --> 33:08.607
It was good.

33:08.608 --> 33:10.587
I need you to help me manage

33:10.588 --> 33:12.507
the situation with Hawk and Ashley.

33:12.508 --> 33:16.497
Sarah, shouldn't we let
him find his own way?

33:16.498 --> 33:18.478
No.

33:20.538 --> 33:22.518
- No.
- Sarah.

33:31.588 --> 33:33.557
You're leaving already?

33:33.558 --> 33:34.567
Yeah.

33:34.568 --> 33:36.467
I have a good idea.

33:36.468 --> 33:37.527
What's that?

33:37.528 --> 33:38.627
I could come with you.

33:38.628 --> 33:41.567
- I don't, uh, think so.
- Why not?

33:41.568 --> 33:45.537
Because I should, um, focus on work.

33:45.538 --> 33:47.497
Am I too distracting for you?

33:47.498 --> 33:49.477
I promise not to bother...

33:49.478 --> 33:52.447
Please, just...

33:52.448 --> 33:54.567
What?

33:54.568 --> 33:58.457
What?

33:58.458 --> 34:00.527
Does he want you?

34:00.528 --> 34:03.447
- Cal.
- No.

34:03.448 --> 34:04.547
Why was he coming in your bedroom

34:04.548 --> 34:06.557
in the middle of the night?

34:06.558 --> 34:08.487
Did you two have a thing or...

34:08.487 --> 34:09.577
Not really.

34:09.578 --> 34:10.647
- Not really?
- It's not a thing.

34:10.648 --> 34:12.577
- Then what?
- Nothing.

34:12.578 --> 34:14.467
Seemed like something.

34:14.467 --> 34:16.476
Enough of something to
send me to Delaware.

34:16.478 --> 34:19.507
He told me to be with you.

34:22.608 --> 34:24.607
Is that why you asked me on a date?

34:24.608 --> 34:27.527
Yes.

34:27.527 --> 34:30.617
So this... this whole
thing, us, it's ju...

34:30.618 --> 34:32.627
- No.
- No?

34:32.628 --> 34:33.647
No, because now I... I...

34:33.648 --> 34:36.607
Okay, what?

34:36.608 --> 34:39.647
You what?

34:39.648 --> 34:43.647
I saw you when I looked into The Light.

34:55.467 --> 34:56.617
Oh, you're doing so good.
You're doing so good.

34:56.618 --> 34:59.437
Look, it's only ten more seconds left.

34:59.438 --> 35:00.507
Ten more seconds, go!

35:00.508 --> 35:01.607
Make sure you get the back ones.

35:01.608 --> 35:03.537
Okay, that's pretty good.

35:03.538 --> 35:07.617
All ri...

35:07.618 --> 35:09.587
- Hey, Joce!
- Yeah?

35:09.588 --> 35:11.477
Hey, I got to take this.

35:11.478 --> 35:14.537
It's after hours. It's after hours.

35:14.538 --> 35:17.537
Uh, yes, Dr. Rothstein.

35:17.538 --> 35:19.457
Thank you for getting back to me.

35:19.458 --> 35:20.637
Jason called me about nine months ago.

35:20.638 --> 35:22.567
He was inquiring

35:22.568 --> 35:24.587
about a clinical test we're running here

35:24.588 --> 35:26.577
for fourth stage pancreatic cancer.

35:26.578 --> 35:28.577
Was he looking for a job?

35:28.578 --> 35:29.667
No, he wanted to buy the drug.

35:29.668 --> 35:31.477
Was he sick?

35:31.478 --> 35:33.537
I don't think it was for him.

35:33.538 --> 35:35.467
Well, did he say who it was for?

35:35.468 --> 35:37.578
No, but it must've been
for a person with means.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.627
Dr. Rothstein...

35:42.628 --> 35:46.437
how much would a drug like that
go for on the black market?

35:46.438 --> 35:48.658
How much is a person's life worth?

35:52.508 --> 35:54.587
I didn't even know where
our bank accounts were

35:54.588 --> 35:57.437
when my husband died.

35:57.438 --> 35:59.487
He was in control of everything.

35:59.488 --> 36:00.667
I keep thinking that

36:00.668 --> 36:02.647
if he had died in a more normal way

36:02.648 --> 36:06.437
like cancer or a heart attack,

36:06.438 --> 36:07.577
I could have asked for support.

36:07.578 --> 36:09.467
You poor thing.

36:09.468 --> 36:11.647
You should've been
supported no matter what.

36:11.648 --> 36:13.647
That's the problem with Systemites.

36:13.648 --> 36:16.547
They lack compassion.

36:16.548 --> 36:19.507
- Mom.
- It's true.

36:19.508 --> 36:21.537
Meg here is walking proof.

36:21.538 --> 36:25.647
We support each other no matter what.

36:25.648 --> 36:30.577
His blood alcohol level was
2.0, which is very high.

36:30.578 --> 36:32.527
Mom, no one wants to know that.

36:32.528 --> 36:34.497
That's not true, honey.

36:34.498 --> 36:36.647
It is so good for your mom to
be getting this stuff out.

36:36.648 --> 36:40.477
We call it unburdening.

36:40.478 --> 36:43.617
Sometimes I wonder if he wanted to die.

36:43.618 --> 36:47.597
Alcoholism is a disease, Mrs. Fields.

36:47.598 --> 36:50.577
A Systemites' disease.

36:50.578 --> 36:52.517
They want us to be alcoholics.

36:52.518 --> 36:53.647
It's the way his Damage

36:53.648 --> 36:55.667
chose to work its way through the body.

37:02.488 --> 37:05.487
You should come to one
of our gatherings.

37:05.488 --> 37:06.557
You should.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.517
Oh, well, as I said,

37:08.518 --> 37:10.657
I'm not very religious.

37:10.658 --> 37:13.607
That's why you're alone now.

38:27.108 --> 38:28.937
They came.

38:33.148 --> 38:36.017
Hey, you okay?

38:36.018 --> 38:38.967
Mom was totally in
their face last night.

38:38.968 --> 38:40.117
I can't believe she invited them.

38:40.118 --> 38:42.027
Well, maybe they wanted to come, kid.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.157
No.

38:43.158 --> 38:45.037
She's staying with us.

38:45.038 --> 38:47.037
How was she supposed to say no?

38:47.038 --> 38:51.028
Your mom is just trying to do
what's best for you, all right?

38:53.098 --> 38:55.057
So easy to lose our way,

38:55.058 --> 39:00.107
to be distracted by our egos,

39:00.108 --> 39:05.137
our desires, our anger, and...
and fears,

39:05.138 --> 39:09.017
and forget what we're meant to do,

39:09.018 --> 39:13.057
and by forgetting, we hurt others.

39:13.058 --> 39:16.017
We... we hurt ourselves.

39:16.018 --> 39:18.087
It happened to me this week.

39:18.088 --> 39:20.167
I had revenge

39:20.168 --> 39:24.017
in my heart, and, uh, you
know where it left me?

39:24.018 --> 39:26.157
Angrier.

39:26.158 --> 39:29.157
Sadder. Lonelier.

39:29.158 --> 39:31.117
Because I forgot.

39:31.118 --> 39:32.167
I forgot.

39:32.168 --> 39:36.037
I forgot that we have it all.

39:36.038 --> 39:39.107
Right, the road, the map, the
compass is all right here.

39:39.108 --> 39:42.037
We have The Ladder, The Light.

39:46.168 --> 39:49.087
But still we forget

39:49.088 --> 39:51.087
because the human condition

39:51.088 --> 39:56.107
is to strive for my fulfillment.

39:56.108 --> 39:58.047
Screw the environment.

39:58.048 --> 40:01.057
Screw, uh, people in far off lands.

40:01.058 --> 40:02.937
Screw your neighbors.

40:02.938 --> 40:05.937
Live for ourselves today.

40:05.938 --> 40:11.027
Well, maybe... maybe that's
what the human experience is,

40:11.028 --> 40:16.127
but I refuse for that to
be my human experience.

40:16.128 --> 40:20.017
I don't want to live for this moment.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.087
I want to live forever

40:22.088 --> 40:26.947
in The Garden that we are
creating here together.

40:26.948 --> 40:29.168
Yeah.

40:31.168 --> 40:34.957
That's... that's not to
say it won't be sad too.

40:34.958 --> 40:37.097
All right, there will be tears to shed

40:37.098 --> 40:41.077
for the ones we love
who choose the shadows

40:41.078 --> 40:43.017
and who will be left

40:43.018 --> 40:48.077
to the floods and the
fires and violence.

40:48.078 --> 40:51.937
They'll be lost to us forever,

40:51.938 --> 40:56.097
but we will remain in love

40:56.098 --> 41:00.097
and light and warmth,

41:00.098 --> 41:04.068
and that will see us
through the pain of loss.

41:11.158 --> 41:13.007
I hate organized religion.

41:13.008 --> 41:15.127
We're not a religion.

41:15.128 --> 41:17.067
Yeah, you are.

41:17.068 --> 41:19.047
It's always the same.

41:19.048 --> 41:20.097
If you're in, you're saved.

41:20.098 --> 41:21.937
If you're not, you're damned.

41:21.938 --> 41:23.007
That's not true.

41:23.008 --> 41:24.037
I just heard your preacher.

41:24.038 --> 41:25.167
He's not a preacher.

41:25.168 --> 41:28.967
I'm gonna burn or drown

41:28.968 --> 41:30.107
or get raped and shot,

41:30.108 --> 41:32.967
and you guys are all gonna
be gardening together.

41:32.968 --> 41:34.937
Okay, it's this equation
where you all think

41:34.938 --> 41:36.127
that you're... you're
better than the rest of us,

41:36.128 --> 41:38.017
and it's just... it's bullshit.
It's ridiculous.

41:38.018 --> 41:39.947
I don't think I'm better, honestly.

41:39.948 --> 41:41.067
Well, what about my dad?

41:41.068 --> 41:42.957
What happens with that?

41:42.958 --> 41:45.967
What happens if I ever
want to see him again?

41:45.968 --> 41:48.007
I mean, even if I join your stupid cult,

41:48.008 --> 41:52.007
I can't because he's an
alcoholic and an Ignorant.

41:52.008 --> 41:54.098
I'm... I'm so sorry.

41:57.128 --> 42:00.157
I don't even know what's
real anymore and what I...

42:00.158 --> 42:03.077
You need to figure it out
because you're real to me.

43:03.058 --> 43:05.957
Yes to The Light.

43:07.138 --> 43:09.067
Yes to The Light.

43:09.068 --> 43:13.047
Yes to The Ladder. Yes to The Light.

43:13.048 --> 43:15.087
Yes to The Ladder.

43:15.088 --> 43:16.977
Yes to The Light.

43:16.978 --> 43:19.017
Yes to The Ladder.

43:19.018 --> 43:21.017
Yes to The Light.

43:21.018 --> 43:23.157
Now, as we all know,

43:23.158 --> 43:27.947
Steve is away transcribing the
next three rungs of The Ladder,

43:27.948 --> 43:31.967
but, uh, I think he would
be incredibly excited

43:31.968 --> 43:34.127
about some special guests

43:34.128 --> 43:37.957
that will be staying here for a while.

43:37.958 --> 43:40.937
Evelyn Hernandez and
her three children,

43:40.938 --> 43:43.987
Gabriel, Clarissa, and Miguel,

43:43.988 --> 43:47.137
and this is Maria and Silvio Gomez

43:47.138 --> 43:50.967
and their American-born
daughter, Betty.

43:50.968 --> 43:55.107
Sadly, the sisters of the
Church of the Sacred Heart

43:55.108 --> 43:58.037
couldn't take the risk,

43:58.038 --> 44:02.008
but I told them we will.

44:16.128 --> 44:19.117
Hey, what'd you think?

44:19.118 --> 44:22.007
Yeah, it's very interesting.

44:22.008 --> 44:24.147
Yeah, so I, um, I have great news.

44:24.148 --> 44:27.137
I spoke with my dentist, and
he needs a receptionist.

44:27.138 --> 44:28.997
- Really?
- Yeah.

44:28.998 --> 44:30.027
Wow, I could do that.

44:30.028 --> 44:31.057
I could be a receptionist.

44:31.058 --> 44:32.117
That's what I told him.

44:32.118 --> 44:34.057
That's amazing. Thank you.

44:34.058 --> 44:35.057
Oh, my God, you're welcome.

44:35.058 --> 44:36.067
It's my pleasure.

44:47.128 --> 44:50.097
- I can't find Hawk anywhere.
- I'm sorry.

44:50.098 --> 44:51.987
I couldn't let you go after him.

44:51.988 --> 44:53.968
Why not?

45:02.058 --> 45:03.977
I'm impressed.

45:03.978 --> 45:06.117
Well, actually, it was your husband

45:06.118 --> 45:08.077
who got me back on track.

45:08.078 --> 45:10.097
The magic of 7R.

45:10.098 --> 45:14.087
Still, you did it.

45:14.088 --> 45:16.977
Is Hawk okay? I saw him leave.

45:16.978 --> 45:18.958
I don't know.

45:23.998 --> 45:25.157
Hey.

45:25.158 --> 45:28.067
That was pretty amazing in there.

45:28.068 --> 45:30.137
I mean, you guys are right
to take that stand.

45:30.138 --> 45:33.117
We're a country of immigrants.

45:33.118 --> 45:35.047
We weren't shackled and brought here.

45:35.048 --> 45:38.937
We braved seas.

45:38.938 --> 45:40.957
- Yeah.
- Mm.

45:40.958 --> 45:45.127
You know, how long has Steve
been away writing those rungs?

45:45.128 --> 45:46.957
Months.

45:46.958 --> 45:48.987
