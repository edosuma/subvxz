00:10.303 --> 00:12.847
We have already seen...

00:13.056 --> 00:16.142
<i>...chaos on the stock exchange.</i>

00:17.018 --> 00:19.062
<i>Extortion.</i>

00:20.230 --> 00:23.483
<i>This gentle minstrel is a threat?</i>

00:25.860 --> 00:27.695
<i>You bet.</i>

00:30.156 --> 00:31.908
<i>How to trace him?</i>

00:33.493 --> 00:36.704
<i>Perhaps by this ingenious bird.</i>

00:38.581 --> 00:40.792
<i>Affirmative.</i>

00:42.335 --> 00:44.671
<i>How to gain entry?</i>

00:46.381 --> 00:48.258
<i>But it's a trap.</i>

00:48.925 --> 00:52.303
<i>Batman prepares for another trap.</i>

00:52.887 --> 00:55.223
<i>Not a trap door.</i>

00:57.308 --> 01:00.311
<i>And a rotating spit.</i>

01:00.770 --> 01:05.984
<i>Rare, medium, well done?</i>

01:06.985 --> 01:11.698
<i>While a musical monster
supplies his accompaniment.</i>

01:13.324 --> 01:17.787
<i>Can the Dynamic Duo survive this?</i>

01:19.122 --> 01:23.126
<i>Are they and their goose
to be permanently cooked?</i>

01:26.296 --> 01:28.298
<i>Hang on and find out...</i>

01:28.506 --> 01:32.093
<i>...in just one sizzling minute.</i>

<i>Batman and Robin rotate and revolve</i>

03:00.807 --> 03:02.475
<i>As the heat mounts</i>

03:02.684 --> 03:04.644
<i>You'll lose all resolve</i>

03:04.852 --> 03:08.106
<i>In a few minutes, we will be prepared</i>

03:08.523 --> 03:12.652
<i>To leave you here cooking and exit this lair</i>

03:13.444 --> 03:15.071
I've about had it, Batman.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.365
I know. Try to hang on, old chum.

03:19.492 --> 03:21.369
- What's that?
-Sounded like an explosion.

03:21.577 --> 03:22.912
Well, let's find out.

03:28.835 --> 03:30.712
It's the Bat Bombs I planted.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.464
It caused the distraction I needed.

03:42.014 --> 03:45.560
If we could just shake this turnspit
pole and snap.

03:51.858 --> 03:53.693
Looks like we've been bombed, boss.

03:53.901 --> 03:57.989
Obviously a diversionary tactic,
let's get back down to quarters.

04:02.243 --> 04:05.747
Our barbecue chef will be right back.
Let's surprise him.

04:11.961 --> 04:14.464
Minstrel, they're gone.

04:15.256 --> 04:16.716
Now.

04:36.235 --> 04:38.446
Holy fireworks.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.865
Look.

04:42.575 --> 04:44.660
<i>A wandering minstrel I</i>

04:44.869 --> 04:47.747
<i>And now's the time to wander</i>

04:47.955 --> 04:50.374
<i>To give me time to ponder</i>

04:50.583 --> 04:53.085
<i>For my men have gotten their lumps</i>

04:53.294 --> 04:57.965
<i>I don't indulge in fisticuffs
or vulgar brawling</i>

04:58.174 --> 05:00.927
<i>I hear far places calling</i>

05:01.135 --> 05:03.971
<i>I'll come back when I hold all the trumps</i>

05:04.180 --> 05:08.351
<i>I'll come back when I hold all the trumps</i>

05:09.227 --> 05:11.521
I have yet to admit defeat, Robin...

05:11.729 --> 05:16.108
...but I do find him somewhat frustrating.
-At least we've captured his headquarters.

05:16.317 --> 05:19.153
His headquarters, but certainly not
his broadcasting studio...

05:19.362 --> 05:21.906
...nor his henchmen, apparently.

05:24.075 --> 05:25.785
- Let's go after them.
-No, Robin.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.996
Why bother with riffraff,
it's the Minstrel we want.

05:29.205 --> 05:32.083
He may've taken some
of the wind out of my sails...

05:32.291 --> 05:36.087
...with that murderous barbecue-- Some...

05:39.215 --> 05:41.008
...but not all.

05:42.635 --> 05:46.097
Hello, I'm Octavia.

05:47.932 --> 05:50.560
Your purse.

05:50.768 --> 05:53.604
I didn't mean that. I mean, I surrender.

05:53.813 --> 05:55.773
That's hardly necessary.

05:55.982 --> 05:59.318
Just from looking at you,
I'm sure your presence here is innocent.

05:59.861 --> 06:01.779
Appearances are deceiving, Batman.

06:01.988 --> 06:04.323
Appearances, perhaps.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.450
Instinct, seldom.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.703
That's nice.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.997
You're nice.

06:11.289 --> 06:13.624
I think I might like it better
being on your side.

06:13.833 --> 06:17.753
It's always a satisfactory feeling
knowing you're on the side of right, Octavia.

06:19.505 --> 06:21.007
I wasn't talking about right.

06:23.175 --> 06:24.969
I know.

06:25.553 --> 06:28.848
- Are you taking me in?
-Where?

06:29.557 --> 06:33.978
- Why?
-Thank you, Batman.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.481
Perhaps some other time,
some other place.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.109
I hope so.

06:42.153 --> 06:44.363
Then goodbye for now.

06:52.663 --> 06:54.749
You're letting her go?

06:55.458 --> 06:58.044
Well, I admit she's gorgeous, Batman, but...

06:58.252 --> 07:00.254
...what did she have the others didn't?

07:00.463 --> 07:04.425
Well, Robin, for one thing,
she has a tracking device which I...

07:04.634 --> 07:06.427
...just placed in her handbag.

07:08.012 --> 07:10.556
But Batman found the
heterodyning counter oscillator...

07:10.765 --> 07:12.433
...that was planted by the Minstrel.

07:12.642 --> 07:16.020
We're not after bugs.
We're after the Minstrel himself...

07:16.228 --> 07:19.690
...and he walked out of the
stock-exchange building as free as a bird.

07:19.899 --> 07:24.362
- What are you trying to say, Chief O'Hara?
-We haven't heard from the Caped Crusader.

07:24.570 --> 07:27.281
And the Minstrel's been on the air
with another warning.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.116
He also warned Batman.

07:29.325 --> 07:32.370
Or could it be some kind of a signal?

07:32.787 --> 07:35.915
Have you the temerity to imply
that Batman...

07:36.123 --> 07:37.917
...was working with the Minstrel?

07:38.125 --> 07:41.170
I don't want to imply it,
but mother machree, commissioner...

07:41.379 --> 07:43.923
...what do we really know
about Batman and Robin?

07:44.131 --> 07:45.967
Two-- Two masked figures.

07:46.175 --> 07:48.177
Two voices on the telephone.

07:48.386 --> 07:51.055
Whence did they come?
Whither do they go?

07:51.263 --> 07:53.349
Whence and whither
be dashed, Chief O'Hara.

07:53.557 --> 07:56.185
Isn't it enough to know
they're saviors of Gotham City?

07:56.352 --> 07:58.813
Ahh. And helped out from time to time...

07:59.021 --> 08:01.857
...from a department of which
I am the chief, may I add.

08:02.066 --> 08:04.068
You may not.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.988
As a matter of fact,
I have a darn good mind to--

08:13.202 --> 08:15.621
- Yes, Batman?
-I would've called you sooner...

08:15.788 --> 08:18.165
...but I have nothing tangible to report.

08:18.374 --> 08:19.834
I still don't.

08:20.042 --> 08:22.545
As a matter of fact,
we were a little concerned.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.424
And rightly so,
Minstrel is tricky and cunning.

08:26.632 --> 08:28.467
But I would like to assure you now...

08:28.676 --> 08:32.221
...that Robin and I won't rest
until he's safely behind bars for good.

08:32.429 --> 08:36.475
<i>Would you pass that on to your stalwart
co-fighter in crime, Chief O'Hara?</i>

08:36.642 --> 08:38.977
Uh, yes, indeed, Batman.

08:48.738 --> 08:50.614
Now, Chief O'Hara.

08:50.823 --> 08:54.952
It's hard for a proud man
like meself to...

08:55.369 --> 08:58.581
...ask forgiveness and to admit mistakes...

08:58.789 --> 09:00.332
...but Commissioner Gordon...

09:00.541 --> 09:04.003
...I was foolish and wrong, and I'm sorry.

09:04.211 --> 09:09.383
Spoken like the upstanding gentleman
and officer of the law that...

09:09.592 --> 09:15.514
...all Gotham City has come
to love and admire, Chief O'Hara.

09:16.891 --> 09:20.478
To defame the Dynamic Duo,
even by implication...

09:20.686 --> 09:23.898
...is both unjust and reprehensible.

09:24.106 --> 09:27.693
They are the guardian angels of this city.

09:27.902 --> 09:30.654
Those two masked figures...

09:30.863 --> 09:34.200
...those two voices on the telephone.

09:37.036 --> 09:38.871
What do you think the boss is gonna do?

09:39.080 --> 09:40.664
I don't know. He's pretty angry.

09:40.873 --> 09:43.417
Yeah. He sure hates to lose.

09:51.300 --> 09:54.053
What happened?
Didn't Batman take you to jail?

09:54.261 --> 09:56.472
No, of course not.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.600
As a matter of fact,
he was very considerate.

10:00.476 --> 10:03.646
- Very <i>nice.</i>
- I'm sure.

10:03.813 --> 10:06.982
<i>Well, he was. He's quite</i> a <i>gentleman.</i>

10:07.191 --> 10:09.110
- Think you've got it?
-Pretty close.

10:09.318 --> 10:13.030
- Shall we send the Bat-drone Plane again?
-That won't be necessary, Robin.

10:13.239 --> 10:16.867
<i>Minstrel, you don't really
have to be so drastic.</i>

10:17.076 --> 10:20.121
Batman's reasonable,
maybe you could make a deal with him.

10:20.329 --> 10:24.083
A deal? Me, make a deal
with that paragon of propriety.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.253
That righteous reformer,
that enemy of enterprise...

10:27.461 --> 10:28.796
...that thorn in my flesh?

10:29.004 --> 10:30.381
Never.

10:30.589 --> 10:32.883
Anyhow, he wouldn't do it.

10:34.844 --> 10:37.346
What gave you that idea anyhow?

10:37.555 --> 10:40.850
You must've had a very
cozy little chat with Batman...

10:41.058 --> 10:43.894
...or should I say, warm, intimate.

10:44.103 --> 10:47.189
He was a perfect gentleman, I tell you.

10:47.773 --> 10:50.109
I see what you meant
when you said she was special.

10:58.576 --> 10:59.952
What did you say?

11:00.786 --> 11:04.331
I said he was a perfect gentleman.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.125
Ha!

11:11.297 --> 11:13.382
That's what the
perfect gentleman was doing...

11:13.591 --> 11:16.010
...when he was being so considerate...

11:16.218 --> 11:19.513
- ...bugging your purse.
-Why, that spy.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.390
<i>That spy fink.</i>

11:21.599 --> 11:23.726
That does it. Listen to me, Batman.

11:23.934 --> 11:26.270
We go to plan High C.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.856
Oh no, boss. Not plan High C.

11:29.064 --> 11:30.524
What if it gets out of control?

11:30.733 --> 11:32.818
Yeah. It could bring the whole world down.

11:33.485 --> 11:36.113
The world? Holy cosmos.

11:36.322 --> 11:38.324
That's a big order, Robin.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.702
Who cares? So what? It's their world.

11:41.911 --> 11:43.579
Here me again, Batman.

11:43.787 --> 11:46.081
You thought you were
being so very clever...

11:46.290 --> 11:49.710
...bugging the lady's purse to
track down the location of this studio.

11:49.919 --> 11:51.712
Well, better than finding my studio...

11:51.921 --> 11:55.549
...I suggest you might want
details of my plan, High C.

11:55.758 --> 11:59.178
Join your broker friends in the
conference room of the stock exchange...

11:59.386 --> 12:01.680
...in <i>exactly 30 minutes,
and I wouldn't be late.</i>

12:01.889 --> 12:04.934
Have Commissioner Gordon,
Chief O'Hara and Mr. Cortland too.

12:05.142 --> 12:09.855
I'm sure they'll find it most interesting.
Over and out.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.360
I'm sorry to bother you, sir.
It's Mrs. Cooper.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.196
She was quite concerned
when you were away last night.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.449
I trust you supplied her with
a plausible excuse, Alfred.

12:20.658 --> 12:22.076
I did my best, sir.

12:22.284 --> 12:25.287
But could you tell me,
perhaps, when you will be home?

12:25.496 --> 12:28.123
We have a brief stop first,
we're trying to prevent--

12:28.332 --> 12:30.417
The end of the world.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.588
End of the world?

12:55.442 --> 12:57.278
- Is it time yet?
-Close.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.196
One minute, 45 seconds.

12:59.405 --> 13:01.282
What do you think he'll do, Batman?

13:01.490 --> 13:02.825
I wish I could guess.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.577
Maybe we should've gone
along with him from the first.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.913
You mean give into blackmail? That's ruin.

13:08.122 --> 13:10.874
- What is it if we don't?
-You suppose he's bluffing?

13:11.083 --> 13:12.293
I wouldn't count on it.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.838
- What's that?
-What's what?

13:16.046 --> 13:17.965
I don't know, but look.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.264
And the chandelier.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.061
The whole room be going.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.314
It's an earthquake.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.487
What's happening, Batman?

13:40.904 --> 13:42.906
Nothing's shaking. It's not an earthquake.

13:43.115 --> 13:45.034
It's the Minstrel.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.413
- It stopped.
-What--?

13:49.621 --> 13:52.041
How could it have happened, Batman?
How did he do it?

13:52.249 --> 13:54.043
I don't know how he did it.

13:54.251 --> 13:55.878
I do know what he did.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.839
He must've determined
the frequency of this building...

13:59.048 --> 14:01.967
...using the ventilating shafts
as resonant chambers...

14:02.176 --> 14:04.887
...he generated a corresponding frequency.

14:05.095 --> 14:08.474
I see. The same way a singer
can shatter a crystal glass...

14:08.682 --> 14:10.559
...by hitting its resonant note, right?

14:10.768 --> 14:14.521
Right. Precisely, Robin.
It's called "sympathetic vibration."

14:14.730 --> 14:17.024
Of course, that would be a high note.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.985
His must've been subsonic.

14:20.194 --> 14:23.947
Impossible for the
human ear to detect. Too low.

14:24.156 --> 14:27.576
Then if he hadn't stopped,
the building would've shaken itself apart.

14:27.785 --> 14:29.203
- Right.
-That means he could--

14:29.411 --> 14:31.288
Batman, everybody.

14:31.497 --> 14:32.956
He's on the air.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.169
<i>Well, gentlemen,
how did you like the sample?</i>

14:38.837 --> 14:42.883
<i>- And now, this message.
- He's so suave.</i>

14:43.342 --> 14:45.928
<i>I am the Minstrel
And</i> a <i>mastermind</i>

14:46.136 --> 14:48.347
<i>I'm a modern genius crook</i>

14:48.555 --> 14:51.308
<i>In electronics, I cannot be surpassed</i>

14:51.517 --> 14:54.103
<i>And that's why your building shook</i>

14:54.311 --> 14:55.854
<i>To my terms you must agree</i>

14:56.063 --> 14:59.149
<i>Or vibration, consternation, desolation</i>

14:59.358 --> 15:01.193
<i>Throughout the nation</i>

15:01.402 --> 15:05.948
<i>Accept my terms or there will be
Irreversible calamity</i>

15:06.156 --> 15:09.618
<i>You have until nightfall
To prevent a frightful downfall</i>

15:11.286 --> 15:12.496
Here are <i>the</i> terms.

15:12.663 --> 15:13.956
One:

15:14.123 --> 15:16.708
<i>The certified checks made
out as you were instructed...</i>

15:16.917 --> 15:19.002
<i>...will be turned over
to Commissioner Gordon.</i>

15:19.336 --> 15:22.423
<i>Two: Commissioner Gordon
will deliver them to my men...</i>

15:22.631 --> 15:24.049
<i>...when I so request.</i>

15:24.258 --> 15:27.261
<i>Three: Announcement
of your agreement to this...</i>

15:27.469 --> 15:29.972
<i>...will be made on this channel
at 6 o'clock sharp...</i>

15:30.180 --> 15:32.891
...or <i>the stock exchange
becomes</i> a <i>pile of rubble.</i>

15:33.475 --> 15:36.145
<i>And there is nothing
Batman can do to stop it.</i>

15:36.353 --> 15:39.690
<i>Remember, 6 o'clock sharp.</i>

15:42.276 --> 15:43.986
- We've got to do it.
-We can't do it.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.529
Are you mad? He means it.

15:45.696 --> 15:47.656
Yes, but a quarter million dollars a week?

15:47.823 --> 15:52.661
- Is there any alternative, Batman?
-There just may be, commissioner.

15:52.870 --> 15:55.456
It's not true, gentlemen, that your building...

15:55.664 --> 15:58.000
...will inevitably be disintegrated.

15:58.625 --> 16:02.379
For no matter what exotic
and brilliant devices...

16:02.588 --> 16:07.259
...the Minstrel's installed,
he cannot operate without power.

16:07.468 --> 16:09.470
Holy kilowatts, of course.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.805
- Cut off the power.
-How simple.

16:12.014 --> 16:15.142
Not so simple, to locate
all the circuits in this building...

16:15.350 --> 16:19.438
...and connect them to one
master switch in the allotted time.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.231
But it can be done.

16:21.440 --> 16:25.486
Then at the first sign of vibration,
you just throw the switch? Marvelous.

16:25.694 --> 16:28.280
What if he does something else?
We can't risk it.

16:28.489 --> 16:30.824
If you knuckle under
to this extortionist now...

16:31.033 --> 16:33.619
...do you think he'll stop
at a quarter million a week?

16:33.827 --> 16:36.038
- He may demand anything.
-That's it, Robin.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.373
Gentlemen, even at the risk of seeing...

16:38.582 --> 16:41.627
...this entire neighborhood
collapse under your feet...

16:41.835 --> 16:45.839
...would you spend the rest of your lives
in the shadow...

16:46.048 --> 16:50.677
...living in subservience
to this rascally ruthless tyrant?

16:50.886 --> 16:52.471
Go ahead, Batman...

16:52.679 --> 16:54.097
...we'll stand fast.

16:54.306 --> 16:58.227
Good. I'll need your building engineer
and your entire electrical crew.

16:58.435 --> 16:59.978
You have them, Batman.

17:00.979 --> 17:04.023
We'll assemble here before 6 o'clock,
with our board of governors.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.449
More here than I expected.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.577
Blind faith in the Batman, I guess.

17:56.785 --> 17:59.204
Well, the way I see it,
if Batman can't help us...

17:59.413 --> 18:02.291
...there's no hope anyhow.
Oh. Oh, there he is now.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.296
- Everything's set.
-I think so.

18:07.462 --> 18:08.922
- That the open line?
-That's it.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.550
Good. This is Batman.
Are the switches ready?

18:12.426 --> 18:15.846
- Ready, Batman.
-Good. Standby.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.848
- We made it.
-And in the nick of time.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.641
Light the candles.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.773
- Do you think he might change his mind?
-No chance.

18:26.982 --> 18:28.525
Time.

18:30.193 --> 18:32.321
- Throw the switches.
-Right.

18:37.576 --> 18:40.746
Wait. What's that? Look at the chandelier.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.601
- Turn it off.
-I can't. He's broadcasting.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.728
Here he is.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.314
<i>Do I have you attention?</i>

19:07.522 --> 19:11.193
<i>Batman, your world will tumble down,
Just wait and see</i>

19:11.610 --> 19:14.738
<i>Your city will disintegrate,
It matters not to me</i>

19:14.946 --> 19:18.867
<i>Batman's and Robin's strength
Will not avail no matter what they do</i>

19:19.076 --> 19:20.619
<i>They're bound to fail</i>

19:20.994 --> 19:23.246
<i>They can't evade my sonic beam</i>

19:23.455 --> 19:25.540
<i>And they'll become a vapor trail</i>

19:25.749 --> 19:29.628
<i>Which should be evident to
the most obtuse by now, I think.</i>

19:29.836 --> 19:32.339
<i>However, there's still time
to change your minds...</i>

19:32.547 --> 19:33.882
<i>...though not much.</i>

19:34.091 --> 19:38.220
<i>If you wish my protection,
simply say so, I'll get the word.</i>

19:38.428 --> 19:42.140
<i>But I'm warning you, do not delay.</i>

19:43.850 --> 19:46.061
- He's got us.
-Batman has obviously failed.

19:46.269 --> 19:48.480
- We've got to do it.
-All right. We give up.

19:48.689 --> 19:50.857
You've got a deal, Minstrel.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.069
Well, at least we're still alive...

19:54.277 --> 19:56.071
...in spite of this devious devil.

19:56.279 --> 19:59.741
But for what? To knuckle under
to the scoundrel all our lives?

19:59.950 --> 20:02.119
Fortunately, that won't be necessary.

20:02.327 --> 20:04.162
- What?
-That is correct.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.873
For, as it happens, gentlemen...

20:07.082 --> 20:10.377
...we have located Minstrel.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.963
- Just a minute.
-That's the Minstrel?

20:13.171 --> 20:14.965
That nice looking young man?

20:15.173 --> 20:18.593
But how can he be here in this room
and on TV at the same time?

20:18.802 --> 20:21.138
- It was a prerecording.
-This is ridiculous.

20:21.304 --> 20:23.306
- We knew he'd be here.
-To signal a cutoff.

20:23.515 --> 20:25.684
Why destroy a 10 million dollar building...

20:25.892 --> 20:27.894
...belonging to people
he wanted money from?

20:28.103 --> 20:30.188
We went through with it
so he would suspect--

20:30.397 --> 20:32.733
But I'm not the Minstrel.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.069
All right, Batman. You asked for it.

20:36.278 --> 20:38.113
Bass, Treble. All the rest of you.

21:46.890 --> 21:49.267
It won't work, Minstrel.

21:49.476 --> 21:52.270
We're wearing our
Particle Bat Accelerator units.

21:52.479 --> 21:55.524
To create an anti-charge
and deflect your static bolts.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.734
So there's no way out, Minstrel.

21:57.943 --> 22:00.195
All right, Chief O'Hara.
You can take him away.

22:02.447 --> 22:05.784
And this time, Minstrel, no song, please.

22:05.992 --> 22:09.579
I don't think you'd be doing any
singing in public for a long, long time.

22:09.788 --> 22:11.373
Come along, you.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.684
<i>Good evening. Late this evening...</i>

22:30.892 --> 22:32.769
<i>...that melodic master of crime...</i>

22:32.978 --> 22:37.232
<i>...who, earlier, came within a tremble
of subjugating all of Gotham City...</i>

22:37.440 --> 22:40.151
<i>...is now on his way to the city jail...</i>

22:40.360 --> 22:42.988
<i>...thanks, once again,
to our savior Batman.</i>

22:43.530 --> 22:47.492
<i>You may be interested to know
that bail has been denied.</i>

22:48.034 --> 22:50.495
<i>However, before he is incarcerated...</i>

22:50.704 --> 22:54.624
...we <i>have been granted
this exclusive interview.</i>

22:54.833 --> 22:56.543
Oh, look.

22:56.751 --> 22:59.504
They've arrested that charming man.

22:59.713 --> 23:00.922
<i>REPORTER".
Tell me, Minstrel Man.</i>

23:01.631 --> 23:06.094
<i>Due to the fact that you have
been defeated by the Dynamic Duo...</i>

23:06.303 --> 23:07.971
<i>...despite your electronic genius...</i>

23:08.179 --> 23:10.599
<i>...do you have any plans
in your future for crime?</i>

23:10.807 --> 23:12.976
<i>Why, yes. As a matter of fact, I have.</i>

23:13.184 --> 23:16.730
<i>Wait till the jail break Batman</i>

23:16.938 --> 23:20.108
<i>You've not seen the last of me</i>

23:20.317 --> 23:23.862
<i>I'll clobber you and Robin</i>

23:24.070 --> 23:27.449
<i>Wait and see</i>

23:27.657 --> 23:31.161
<i>You'll vibrate both together</i>

23:31.369 --> 23:34.456
<i>I'll shake off your heads</i>

23:34.664 --> 23:38.627
<i>Oh, just you wait
Till the jail break Batman</i>

23:38.835 --> 23:41.588
<i>You'll be dead</i>

23:41.963 --> 23:44.466
Uh... <i>Thank you very much,
Mr. Minstrel Man.</i>

23:44.674 --> 23:47.844
<i>And ladies and gentlemen,
that concludes our program for tonight.</i>

23:48.053 --> 23:50.055
<i>Take him out. Now.</i>

23:53.266 --> 23:57.103
Surely a man with such a voice
can't be all bad.

23:57.729 --> 24:02.025
Perhaps he can learn to make an
honest living when he comes out of prison.

24:02.233 --> 24:05.403
If only someone would help.

24:05.612 --> 24:08.907
Commissioner Gordon
is a friend of yours, isn't he?

24:09.115 --> 24:11.493
Why, yes, he is, Aunt Harriet. In a way.

24:11.701 --> 24:15.580
And even though Minstrel
might sneer at such a suggestion...

24:15.747 --> 24:17.415
...I will bring it to his attention.

24:17.582 --> 24:19.918
Who knows? It just might work.
