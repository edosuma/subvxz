00:13.668 --> 00:15.169

00:15.170 --> 00:18.004

by someone on our side.

00:23.477 --> 00:24.912
- Ah.
- Morning.

00:24.913 --> 00:26.547
When did you get home?

00:26.548 --> 00:27.915
Oh, about half an hour ago.

00:27.916 --> 00:29.917
But I'm just here to take a shower,

00:29.918 --> 00:32.186
then I got to head
right back over there.

- Absolutely.

00:54.042 --> 00:55.409
Oh.

00:55.410 --> 00:58.445
- No word yet on Nafisa?
- No.

00:58.446 --> 01:00.514
But intelligence finally
combed through all the data

01:00.515 --> 01:02.416
from the leak at the Kabul embassy.

01:02.417 --> 01:04.285
Uh, the report came out last night.

01:04.286 --> 01:06.086
I know... it was my bedtime reading.

01:06.087 --> 01:07.321
Plenty of hacked e-mails

01:07.322 --> 01:09.223
revealing the safe house location,

01:09.224 --> 01:12.159
but nothing about Nafisa's identity.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.895
She must have been burned
by another source.

01:14.896 --> 01:16.430
The most obvious explanation is

01:16.431 --> 01:19.466
their asset, Osip Bakunin,
was a double agent.

01:19.467 --> 01:20.501

01:30.545 --> 01:32.880

and, believe it or not...

01:32.881 --> 01:35.400
We haven't been in the same room together
for three days? Yeah, we're aware.

01:35.401 --> 01:37.051

- Work stuff.

01:37.052 --> 01:39.319
Yeah, it's... I get it. Um...

01:40.254 --> 01:42.957
Okay, so there's not
really an easy way to...

01:42.958 --> 01:44.225

01:47.995 --> 01:49.862
Um...

01:52.433 --> 01:54.501
Jareth and I broke up.

01:54.502 --> 01:57.004
- Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
- Oh. What happened?

01:57.005 --> 01:59.906
Lots of stuff, but mainly just...

02:00.641 --> 02:02.710
I don't know, it wasn't right.

02:02.711 --> 02:05.446
We were really trying
to make it work, and...

02:05.447 --> 02:09.149
I guess he just decided
to stop... trying,

02:09.150 --> 02:10.550
so...

02:10.551 --> 02:12.419
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

02:12.420 --> 02:14.388

02:14.389 --> 02:16.590
Oh.

02:16.591 --> 02:19.627

I'm gonna make your favorite.

- No, Mom, it's okay.

I got to... I have to get to
work, but, uh, I'll be fine.

02:25.734 --> 02:28.035
I just hope you guys
aren't too disappointed.

You know? I-I just know how much

02:30.438 --> 02:33.007
you liked him, and... and you were...

02:33.008 --> 02:34.608

02:34.609 --> 02:35.843
We're over him already.

02:35.844 --> 02:37.978
- (CHUCKLES)

02:37.979 --> 02:40.180

02:40.181 --> 02:43.083

I pass a relationship landmark,

02:43.084 --> 02:45.319

02:45.320 --> 02:48.054
something.

02:49.490 --> 02:53.227

02:55.597 --> 02:59.366

- Well, that's...
- That's... Mm.

03:11.646 --> 03:15.916

03:48.850 --> 03:51.051

03:51.052 --> 03:53.120
NAFISA (ON VIDEO): <i>My name</i>

03:53.121 --> 03:55.723
is Nafisa Samadi.

03:55.724 --> 03:58.692
I am an agent of the CIA,

03:58.693 --> 04:01.628
sent by the corrupt
American government

04:01.629 --> 04:04.031
to spy on the Afghan people.

04:04.032 --> 04:06.000
As a prisoner of the Taliban,

04:06.001 --> 04:08.535
my captors have demands for my return:

04:08.536 --> 04:11.739
$100 million...

04:11.740 --> 04:14.975
and the release
of six Taliban fighters

04:14.976 --> 04:17.411
currently being held
in Parwan Detention Center.

04:17.411 --> 04:20.481
Ebadullah Gulbaz, Abdul Sadat...

04:20.482 --> 04:22.282
It was uploaded an hour ago

04:22.283 --> 04:23.884
somewhere in the Wardak Province.

04:23.885 --> 04:26.653
(SIGHS): Media will run
wild with the CIA angle.

04:26.654 --> 04:29.523
Nafisa's cover was as
an English teacher in Kabul.

04:29.524 --> 04:32.426
The press will have a trail to
follow to Chindawal High School.

04:32.427 --> 04:35.129
But that doesn't change the
fact that the Taliban knows

04:35.130 --> 04:37.898
exactly who she is and how
much she's worth to us.

04:37.899 --> 04:40.768
We need to get her back
as quickly as possible.

04:40.769 --> 04:42.102
HENRY: Then I think

04:42.103 --> 04:43.804
we should consider paying the ransom.

04:43.805 --> 04:45.506
RUSSELL: The United States government

04:45.507 --> 04:48.342
does not give in to extortion
demands from terrorists.

04:48.343 --> 04:50.110
I understand the policy, Russell.

04:50.111 --> 04:52.679
If we pay, Americans abroad will
have a target on their backs,

04:52.680 --> 04:54.314
we'll be working
against our own interests

04:54.315 --> 04:57.117
by potentially funding the very
groups we're trying to destroy.

04:57.118 --> 04:58.098
What's your quibble?

04:58.099 --> 04:59.816
The world is not so black
and white anymore.

04:59.817 --> 05:03.223
Americans have always
been taken by radical groups.

05:03.224 --> 05:06.560
Only now, when we don't pay,
they're more likely to be murdered.

05:06.561 --> 05:09.496
And their execution videos
become a recruiting tool.

05:09.497 --> 05:12.733
France, Italy, Germany,
Spain, Switzerland,

05:12.734 --> 05:14.201
South Africa, they all pay...

05:14.202 --> 05:16.937
directly or by proxy.

05:16.938 --> 05:18.372
And their people come back alive.

05:18.373 --> 05:21.508
Yes, we are holding the
line for a principle,

05:21.509 --> 05:23.277

05:23.278 --> 05:24.812
And Americans are dying.

how complicated it is.

05:27.315 --> 05:29.716
It's just...

a rethink on policy might not
be helpful at this juncture.

05:33.988 --> 05:36.423
DALTON: I appreciate your
alternative view, Henry,

05:36.424 --> 05:39.426
but it's a nonstarter.

05:39.427 --> 05:41.962
The United States does not
negotiate with terrorists.

05:41.963 --> 05:44.565
And that's a policy I'm
not prepared to end today.

05:44.566 --> 05:46.500
Let's talk about other options.

05:46.501 --> 05:48.769
There's a SEAL team in
Bagram that's ready to go.

05:48.770 --> 05:50.237
All we need is a location.

05:50.238 --> 05:52.396
Our contacts on the ground
have yielded nothing.

05:52.397 --> 05:54.341

05:54.342 --> 05:55.642
would shake something loose.

05:57.112 --> 05:59.279
authorize up to $5 million

French are denying it,

ten million euros.

08:58.784 --> 09:00.652
and believed he could be trusted.

09:00.653 --> 09:01.786
If a seasoned agent

09:01.787 --> 09:03.088
can be fooled, then anyone can.

09:03.089 --> 09:04.355
Our job is to find her...

09:04.356 --> 09:06.391
let's stay focused on that.

09:06.392 --> 09:08.793
Okay?

09:08.794 --> 09:10.929
I think the last time
we saw each other,

09:10.930 --> 09:13.665
you were digging your
car out of a snowbank

09:13.666 --> 09:15.533
at the top of the Dorah Pass.

09:15.534 --> 09:17.602
I appreciate you
pitching in with a shovel.

09:17.603 --> 09:20.105
It's all part of the unwritten rule...

09:20.106 --> 09:22.874
be willing to help out a fellow spy

09:22.875 --> 09:24.342
whenever possible.

09:24.343 --> 09:27.110
You are here for a favor.

09:27.979 --> 09:31.883
An American woman was
kidnapped in Afghanistan.

09:31.884 --> 09:35.220
We want to get her back
as quickly as possible.

09:35.221 --> 09:39.758
I need you to convince President
Sahi to intercede on our behalf.

09:39.759 --> 09:41.559
It will be expensive.

09:41.560 --> 09:44.662
Money isn't changing hands.

09:44.663 --> 09:47.699
If we financially compensate Pakistan,

09:47.700 --> 09:49.167
there's a good chance

09:49.168 --> 09:51.402
the cash will be passed along

09:51.403 --> 09:54.672
to the Taliban through weapons or aid.

09:54.673 --> 09:58.109
Ah, such sticklers, you Americans.

09:58.110 --> 10:02.346
It's your Puritan heritage.

10:03.681 --> 10:05.150
Look, it would be one thing

10:05.151 --> 10:07.028
if this kidnapped woman
were an aid worker

10:07.029 --> 10:09.788
- or a journalist, but she is CIA.
- She was in Kabul teaching

10:09.789 --> 10:12.590
English literacy to high schoolers.

10:12.591 --> 10:14.524
- Elizabeth.

10:20.965 --> 10:22.567
(SIGHS)

10:22.568 --> 10:24.736
This is an opportunity

10:24.737 --> 10:27.639
for Pakistan to stand on
the world stage with us

10:27.640 --> 10:29.741
and condemn terrorism.

10:29.742 --> 10:34.278
Yes, well, we've been looking
for a way to do that.

10:38.016 --> 10:40.384
I will do my best.

10:41.119 --> 10:44.222
Hey. Can you guys
check me on something?

10:44.223 --> 10:45.825
All right, look,

10:45.826 --> 10:47.492
she's clearly reading
from a scripted statement,

10:47.493 --> 10:48.593
and there's no way to tell

10:48.594 --> 10:49.894
where she's being held.

10:49.895 --> 10:51.569
So maybe I'm looking too hard

10:51.570 --> 10:53.838
for clues, but look at her hands.

10:53.839 --> 10:55.940
You see how they're moving
on the table? And then her eyes.

10:55.941 --> 10:58.877
It's almost imperceptible,

10:58.878 --> 11:01.079
how they're glancing to the side.

11:01.080 --> 11:03.114
It's not CIA tap code.

11:03.115 --> 11:04.883
DMITRI: Maybe...

11:04.884 --> 11:06.785
maybe Morse.

11:06.786 --> 11:11.556
You know, I-I remember there's a
story from the Vietnam War era.

11:11.557 --> 11:14.058
There was a P.O.W.,
Jerry Denton, who...

11:14.059 --> 11:16.227
was forced to film a piece
telling the American government

11:16.228 --> 11:18.897
that prisoners in Hanoi
were being treated well.

11:18.898 --> 11:20.932
He used Morse code.

11:20.933 --> 11:24.001
He blinked out the word "torture."

11:30.375 --> 11:33.411
She's trying to send us a message.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.884
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I'm down here in the kitchen!

11:57.885 --> 11:59.686
Come have dinner with me?

11:59.687 --> 12:01.354
- Please?
- Hi.

12:01.355 --> 12:02.555
Hi.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.524
Dad just texted me from work,

12:04.525 --> 12:06.259
asking how I was doing.

12:06.260 --> 12:07.961
It was very sweet.

12:07.962 --> 12:12.031
Oh, uh, also, Jason
is having dinner at Piper's.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.132
Again?

12:13.133 --> 12:14.634
Well, Piper's mom said that he's

12:14.635 --> 12:16.002
the son she never had, so...

12:16.003 --> 12:18.404
But he's the son I did have.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.806
I'd like him to start

12:19.807 --> 12:21.607
hanging out here more.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.009
Well,

12:23.010 --> 12:25.310
I'm happy to see you.

12:26.045 --> 12:28.847
What did Jareth do?

12:30.450 --> 12:33.453
It's creepy how you do that, Mom.

12:33.454 --> 12:36.456
Okay, so I'm scrolling
through Facebook,

12:36.457 --> 12:37.623
- just to relax, you know.
- Uh-huh.

12:37.624 --> 12:40.360
And I see that Jareth has posted

12:40.361 --> 12:42.228
some pictures
from his grandma's birthday.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.796
This is the first time
he's posted anything

12:43.797 --> 12:44.764
since we broke up.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.466
- He's smiling.
- Yeah!

12:46.467 --> 12:48.234
He's smiling.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.370
Really, really big. And he's wearing

12:50.371 --> 12:52.705
the Ted Baker shirt I got
him for his birthday.

12:52.706 --> 12:55.074
I mean, just, like, h-how can you end

12:55.075 --> 12:57.510
- a two-year relationship
- I-I don't know.

12:57.511 --> 12:59.445
And then smile big,

12:59.446 --> 13:01.781
wearing the shirt that I bought him

13:01.782 --> 13:03.082
like it's nothing?

13:03.083 --> 13:04.317
Here's the thing,

13:04.318 --> 13:07.286
you're gonna have to unfriend Jareth.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.654
I can't do that.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.256
Well, you're never gonna be happy

13:10.257 --> 13:12.625
as long as you're staring
at pictures of him

13:12.626 --> 13:15.995
smiling too big in
shirts you bought him.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.740
It does.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.879
And...

13:32.880 --> 13:35.214
it's gonna suck for a while.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.250
You can't let yourself do things

13:37.251 --> 13:39.951
that are just gonna make it suck more.

13:41.587 --> 13:43.056
Yeah, I know.

13:43.057 --> 13:44.957
But I still have to go
to his apartment

13:44.958 --> 13:46.993
and pack up all my stuff,

13:46.994 --> 13:48.194
leave my key.

13:52.733 --> 13:54.534

13:54.535 --> 13:56.801
I won't.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.341
Morning. What do you got?

14:01.342 --> 14:03.143
DYLAN: This is it. It was Morse code.

14:03.144 --> 14:04.911
This is what Nafisa
was trying to communicate.

14:04.912 --> 14:08.114
Yeah, it turns out she wasn't
using her eyes, just her hands.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.449
The question is, what does it mean?

14:09.450 --> 14:11.318
And they're not
geographical coordinates.

14:11.319 --> 14:13.787
It could be part of an address
or-or a phone number.

14:13.788 --> 14:15.188
But then what's the "M" for?

14:15.189 --> 14:17.190
She risked her life
to get us this message.

14:17.191 --> 14:19.125
Let's have Interpol run a search.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.061
Let's get it out to the
entire intelligence community.

14:21.062 --> 14:22.628
We've got to figure this out.

together for my upcoming speech

14:37.278 --> 14:38.612
was, uh...

14:38.613 --> 14:40.780
was very helpful.

14:40.781 --> 14:42.882
Who told you?

14:42.883 --> 14:44.884
What?

14:44.885 --> 14:47.220
About my breakup. Was it my mom?

14:47.221 --> 14:48.989
ADELE: I didn't mean
to speak out of turn.

14:48.990 --> 14:50.490
I just thought we should
all be sensitive.

14:50.491 --> 14:51.691
No, no, it-it's okay.

14:51.692 --> 14:53.793
And I'm fine.

14:53.794 --> 14:55.095
Of course you're fine.

14:55.096 --> 14:56.730
And in a few months,
you're gonna be saying

14:56.731 --> 14:58.064
this was the best thing

14:58.065 --> 14:59.232
that ever happened to you.

14:59.233 --> 15:02.801
Well, I don't know about that.
(CHUCKLES)

15:05.438 --> 15:07.073
Let me tell you a little story.

15:07.074 --> 15:10.176
I was dating this,
uh... this woman once.

15:10.177 --> 15:11.945
A world-class political operative.

15:11.946 --> 15:14.381
We were just at the point
where I needed to figure out

15:14.382 --> 15:16.416
if we were going to the next level.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.284
And she went out of town,

15:18.285 --> 15:19.953
and I agreed to watch her dog.

15:19.954 --> 15:22.288
A little teacup... something.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.523
Name of Gigi.

15:23.524 --> 15:26.760
Anyway, one day, I'm
walking Gigi, and she gets

15:26.761 --> 15:28.895
spooked by a cab.

15:28.896 --> 15:31.498
Starts chasing it, yanks
the leash right out of my hand.

15:31.499 --> 15:33.767
I'm running down the
street yelling, "Gigi!

15:33.768 --> 15:35.101
- Come back, Gigi" (BOTH CHUCKLING)

15:35.102 --> 15:37.737
But... she's gone.

15:37.738 --> 15:41.975
Well, my girlfriend came home,
and she was furious.

15:41.976 --> 15:44.144
And after an hour

15:44.145 --> 15:46.913
of her shrieking about my immaturity

15:46.914 --> 15:48.948
and lack of good sense, I finally

15:48.949 --> 15:52.619
got down on one knee and begged her...

15:52.620 --> 15:54.454
to marry me.

15:54.455 --> 15:56.222
Wh...

15:56.223 --> 15:59.259

16:00.594 --> 16:02.162
she was right... I was not yet

16:02.163 --> 16:03.697

16:03.698 --> 16:07.867
But it took six miserable years
of marriage to figure that out.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.138
is... don't think of this period

16:12.139 --> 16:15.108
of your life as an engagement
ending... think of it as...

16:15.109 --> 16:17.811
the time you dodged a bullet.

16:17.812 --> 16:19.579
Okay.

16:19.580 --> 16:21.280

Well, let's get him back.

Uh, apparently, a return
call isn't necessary.

he's unable to help.

- Gisele Durand.
- That's this morning.

someone who not only knows

17:49.195 --> 17:51.563
where Nafisa is being
held, but will walk her

17:51.564 --> 17:55.100
out of the Taliban hideout and
deliver her to us personally.

magician want in return?

17:57.300 --> 18:00.608
$50 million and amnesty.

18:01.473 --> 18:02.775
Okay, who is this guy?

18:02.776 --> 18:05.878
Akbar Haq Raquib.

18:05.879 --> 18:08.814
The Taliban deputy minister
of foreign affairs.

18:08.815 --> 18:10.149

18:11.951 --> 18:13.619
Or it could be a trap.

18:13.620 --> 18:15.821
Either way, the U.S. doesn't

18:15.822 --> 18:18.157
negotiate with terrorists,

18:28.968 --> 18:30.235
Morning, Matt.

18:30.236 --> 18:33.272
You didn't happen to see
a stray bear claw, did you?

18:33.273 --> 18:35.040
I-I missed breakfast.

18:35.041 --> 18:37.408
- Ma'am, it's me.
- (MICROWAVE BEEPS)

18:38.343 --> 18:39.745
I skipped breakfast in the hopes

18:39.746 --> 18:41.980
that I might <i>find</i> a stray bear claw.

18:41.981 --> 18:43.648
But... (CLEARS THROAT)

18:45.017 --> 18:46.518
Oh, here's one.

18:46.519 --> 18:48.420
Oh, thank you.

18:48.421 --> 18:51.056
Oh, now can you find me
a new policy advisor?

18:51.057 --> 18:54.159
Well, actually, uh, I do have
a friend who's interested

18:54.160 --> 18:56.562
in the position. Ashley Haines.
I think you'd really like her.

18:56.563 --> 18:59.898
Ma'am, the SVTC call
with Gisele Durand is ready,

18:59.899 --> 19:01.700
and Dr. McCord is on his way up.

19:01.701 --> 19:04.703
Okay. Thank you, Maggie.

19:04.704 --> 19:06.271
Sorry.

19:06.272 --> 19:09.408
Give her information to Blake
and he'll set it up, okay?

19:09.409 --> 19:11.143
Thank you, ma'am.

19:11.144 --> 19:13.078
Ms. Durand, thank you so
much for talking with us.

19:13.079 --> 19:15.447
You're very welcome, Madam Secretary.

19:15.448 --> 19:18.784
I am happy to do whatever
I can to help Nafisa.

19:18.785 --> 19:21.220
How long were you two held together?

19:21.221 --> 19:23.889
Just my last few days
before being released.

19:23.890 --> 19:26.291
I am praying you can get her out soon.

19:26.292 --> 19:27.860
We're doing the best we can.

19:27.861 --> 19:30.162
Did the American consul
give you a code to look at?

19:30.163 --> 19:33.699
Yes, uh, the numbers with
the letter "M" in the middle,

19:33.700 --> 19:36.534
but I'm afraid it didn't
mean anything to me.

19:37.769 --> 19:40.405
Uh, if you can tell us anything
else that you remember

19:40.406 --> 19:44.042
about your time in captivity,
uh, no detail

19:44.043 --> 19:45.077
is too small.

19:45.078 --> 19:47.145
They kept us in a windowless room,

19:47.146 --> 19:49.748
usually in the dark,
so I didn't see much.

19:49.749 --> 19:52.084
But...

19:52.085 --> 19:55.220
sometimes we heard things.

19:55.221 --> 19:56.455
Explosions.

19:56.456 --> 19:59.625
You mean...
like there was combat nearby?

19:59.626 --> 20:00.859
I don't know.

20:00.860 --> 20:04.830
We would hear a huge
boom in the distance,

20:04.831 --> 20:07.666
and then nothing.

20:07.667 --> 20:08.934
For hours.

20:08.935 --> 20:10.536
Sometimes not for a day or two.

20:10.537 --> 20:12.970
Then there would be another.

20:13.906 --> 20:16.008
(QUIETLY):
That's controlled detonations.

20:16.009 --> 20:18.277
The code that Nafisa
tapped out had no context

20:18.278 --> 20:19.912
until we put it together
with the sound

20:19.913 --> 20:21.947
that Gisele Durand heard
during her captivity.

20:21.948 --> 20:23.282
Land mines

20:23.283 --> 20:25.851
- going off.
- There are old minefields

20:25.852 --> 20:27.920
in eastern Afghanistan,

20:27.921 --> 20:30.589
some even left over
from the Soviet occupation.

20:30.590 --> 20:31.757
Army Corps of Engineers

20:31.758 --> 20:33.525
has been working for
decades to clear 'em.

20:33.526 --> 20:35.961
HENRY: We believe that Nafisa caught
a glimpse of a control marker

20:35.962 --> 20:39.231
when she was being transported
that indicated a field

20:39.232 --> 20:42.000
200 meters away at a magnetic bearing

20:42.001 --> 20:44.436
- of 130 degrees.
- I'll have the DoD

20:44.437 --> 20:45.871
synthesize the information,

20:45.872 --> 20:48.840
and once we pinpoint
the location we can discuss

20:48.841 --> 20:51.510
- the option of a raid.
- SEAL Team 4 can transport

20:51.511 --> 20:53.577
to Chapman and be
ready to go in 12 hours.

20:54.346 --> 20:56.048
Do we have any other options

20:56.049 --> 20:58.617
- to discuss?
- Well, I've hit a diplomatic

20:58.618 --> 21:01.086
- brick wall.
- HENRY: There is an analyst

21:01.087 --> 21:02.921
in my department who's identified

21:02.922 --> 21:04.256
a possible source in Afghanistan,

21:04.257 --> 21:06.325
one who's intimately
connected with the Taliban

21:06.326 --> 21:07.793
and their methods.

21:07.794 --> 21:10.069
We're still verifying the information.

21:10.070 --> 21:11.496
DALTON: Well, as soon as
you've vetted the contact,

21:11.497 --> 21:14.099
we'll get into it. In the meantime...

21:14.100 --> 21:16.001
it looks like a, uh, military rescue

21:16.002 --> 21:17.302
is the most expedient way

21:17.303 --> 21:19.437
to get Nafisa Samadi back home, so...

21:20.672 --> 21:22.973
...let's do it.

21:29.450 --> 21:31.085
What's the word from the
recon team, Admiral?

21:31.086 --> 21:32.653
Two guards are posted out front.

21:32.654 --> 21:34.054
Our fireteam will take them out

21:34.055 --> 21:36.104
- <i>and breach the door.
- Before we risk any lives,</i>

21:36.105 --> 21:38.864
is there a way to determine for
a fact that Nafisa's in there?

21:38.865 --> 21:40.146
HILL: No visuals,

21:40.147 --> 21:42.882
but IC surveilled a phone
conversation from this location

21:42.883 --> 21:44.951
in which Nafisa's name was mentioned.

21:44.952 --> 21:46.652
Heat signatures indicate
three people congregated

21:46.653 --> 21:49.187
in a back room.
We think she's one of 'em.

21:50.456 --> 21:52.158
Let's go.

21:52.159 --> 21:53.693
Take the house.

21:53.694 --> 21:55.994
Copy. Go, Team.

21:58.331 --> 21:59.498

21:59.499 --> 22:01.534
(GUNFIRE)

22:01.535 --> 22:03.902
(GUNFIRE CONTINUING)

22:06.172 --> 22:07.740
TEAM MEMBER:
Front clear. Two tangos EKIA.

22:07.741 --> 22:09.407

22:10.609 --> 22:12.778
(RAPID GUNFIRE)
(SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)

22:12.779 --> 22:14.412
Go!

22:21.153 --> 22:22.855
HENRY: Where is she?

22:22.856 --> 22:25.390
(GUNFIRE CONTINUING)

22:27.159 --> 22:28.461
Room two clear.

(HELICOPTER BLADES

22:32.264 --> 22:34.566
RUSSELL: Come on, come on.

22:35.935 --> 22:38.136
It's a torture room.

22:39.972 --> 22:42.974
TEAM MEMBER:
Sir, I think I found something.

22:47.113 --> 22:49.981
That's Nafisa.

22:50.750 --> 22:51.917
What's next?

22:51.918 --> 22:53.219
It's possible we could track them

22:53.220 --> 22:54.620
if they're still in country.

22:54.621 --> 22:57.189
Possible but not likely.

22:57.190 --> 22:59.091
Henry, where are we on your informant?

22:59.092 --> 23:01.460
Well, my guys have
confirmed he's legitimate,

23:01.461 --> 23:03.195
but it's... complicated.

23:03.196 --> 23:05.398
He's close enough that
he would have been read in

23:05.399 --> 23:07.533
to Nafisa's current
location. And he claims

23:07.534 --> 23:09.402
he could walk her out
and deliver her right to us.

23:09.403 --> 23:11.837
Anyone that close would have
to be a member of the Taliban.

23:11.838 --> 23:13.139
RUSSELL: Yeah, I suspect that's why

23:13.140 --> 23:15.541
Henry's saying it's complicated.

23:15.542 --> 23:18.077
It's Akbar Haq Raquib.

23:18.078 --> 23:20.679
HILL: You're suggesting
that we engage the services

23:20.680 --> 23:22.319
of a Taliban minister?

23:22.320 --> 23:24.617
HENRY: I'm suggesting
that we take advantage

23:24.618 --> 23:26.685
of a loophole.
He's looking to leave the group.

23:26.686 --> 23:28.821
How much does he want for Nafisa?

23:28.822 --> 23:30.222
$50 million. And amnesty.

23:30.223 --> 23:31.590
Oh, is that all?

23:31.591 --> 23:33.626
Wh-What about a Domino's franchise,

23:33.627 --> 23:35.861
- get him started in his new home?
- Look, we're talking about

23:35.862 --> 23:37.763
someone who could give us intelligence

23:37.764 --> 23:40.433
that would be impossible
for us to gather otherwise.

23:40.434 --> 23:41.667
True.

23:41.668 --> 23:44.503
But... he could also take our money

23:44.504 --> 23:46.338
and form his own terrorist faction.

23:46.339 --> 23:48.207
Nixon paid airline hijackers.

23:48.208 --> 23:50.242
Jimmy Carter unfroze eight billion

23:50.243 --> 23:52.244
in Iranian assets during

23:52.245 --> 23:54.346
- the embassy crisis.
- That was before 9/11.

23:54.347 --> 23:56.248
I just have to ask...
is holding to the letter

23:56.249 --> 23:58.150
of this policy more important

23:58.151 --> 23:59.952
than saving citizens that it was

23:59.953 --> 24:01.053
designed to protect?

24:01.054 --> 24:03.622
DALTON: I understand your frustration.

24:03.623 --> 24:05.958
But as commander in chief,

24:05.959 --> 24:07.526
I can't, on the one hand,

24:07.527 --> 24:11.097
ask our military and
intelligence communities to risk

24:11.098 --> 24:13.632
their lives in pursuit of these
criminals, and with the other

24:13.633 --> 24:16.734
potentially fund attacks against them.

24:18.637 --> 24:21.739
Let's keep looking.

24:28.147 --> 24:30.014
Hey.

24:32.184 --> 24:34.485
I could have used
a little help in there.

24:35.387 --> 24:37.156
Well, I'm not gonna support

24:37.157 --> 24:40.592
the abandonment of a
policy that I agree with.

24:42.161 --> 24:44.864
15 years ago it could have
been me in Nafisa's position.

24:44.865 --> 24:47.566
I was in Iraq when John
Marino was kidnapped.

24:47.567 --> 24:50.970
In 1997, Conrad was
stationed in Beirut.

24:50.971 --> 24:54.037
None of us are armchair
warriors, Henry.

24:54.038 --> 24:58.578
We all know that there are
real, real-life consequences

24:58.579 --> 24:59.695
to holding the line.

24:59.696 --> 25:01.275
And yet, if the worst
had happened in Iraq

25:01.276 --> 25:03.816
and you'd been taken, I can
tell you without hesitation

25:03.817 --> 25:05.685
that I would have paid the ransom.

25:05.686 --> 25:07.453
Somehow I would have found a way.

25:07.454 --> 25:09.022
Yes, and if, God forbid,

25:09.023 --> 25:11.891
your brief time on the
ground in Pakistan with José

25:11.892 --> 25:13.593
hadn't had a happy ending,

25:13.594 --> 25:15.795
and someone had come to me
and said, "I can get him out.

25:15.796 --> 25:17.230
I can bring him home," well, then

25:17.231 --> 25:18.531
I would have moved heaven and Earth

25:18.532 --> 25:20.600
to make that happen.

25:20.601 --> 25:23.670
But that's my heart, Henry.

25:23.671 --> 25:26.839
That's why policy is written
in the cold light of day.

25:26.840 --> 25:30.476
Handing over millions of dollars

25:30.477 --> 25:32.712
to the people that I
was fighting against,

25:32.713 --> 25:34.847
that wouldn't have been what I wanted.

25:34.848 --> 25:37.216
And yet you and Conrad are fine
handing over millions of dollars

25:37.217 --> 25:38.985
to an informant with some details

25:38.986 --> 25:41.220
- about Nafisa's whereabouts.
- Because that person

25:41.221 --> 25:43.381
- If it goes through rewards for Justice.
- wouldn't be a terrorist.

25:43.382 --> 25:44.649
You're certain about that.

25:44.650 --> 25:46.594
Or do you think it's possible

25:46.595 --> 25:49.420
that during the time this
program has been in existence,

25:49.421 --> 25:52.123
money might have gone to a wrong guy?

25:52.124 --> 25:54.249
- I mean...
- Yes. Yeah, I know.

25:54.250 --> 25:57.362
I know. It's complicated.

25:57.363 --> 25:59.330
I got to go back to work.

25:59.331 --> 26:01.966
And by the way,

26:01.967 --> 26:06.336
policy can be rewritten
in the cold light of day.

26:13.051 --> 26:16.128
- Hey, do you have Ashley Haines' résumé?
- Yeah.

26:16.129 --> 26:17.430
Why?

26:17.431 --> 26:18.976
Matt pitched her to the secretary,

26:18.977 --> 26:20.043
I'm supposed to get her information,

26:20.044 --> 26:21.282
but Matt's not here,

26:21.283 --> 26:23.122
so I just thought...

26:23.123 --> 26:25.757
I'm sensing none of this
is okay with you. Okay.

26:27.994 --> 26:30.162
What about asking India

26:30.163 --> 26:32.465
to remove non-tariff trade
barriers that block Pakistan

26:32.466 --> 26:34.837
from doing more pharmaceutical
business in the area?

26:34.838 --> 26:39.599
India considers Pakistani visa
restrictions a security issue.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.494
You can add it to the wish list,

26:41.495 --> 26:43.541
but it's too big of an ask right now.

26:43.542 --> 26:44.881
MATT: Since we're on the subject

26:44.882 --> 26:46.716
of Pakistan, um,

26:46.717 --> 26:50.086
I spoke to a friend of mine
from my mother's mosque.

26:50.087 --> 26:52.655
Guy's uncle is pretty
tight with President Sahi

26:52.656 --> 26:54.190
from their university days.

26:54.191 --> 26:58.561
Now, word is, an ISI agent
was captured in India

26:58.562 --> 27:01.664
almost ten years ago, Maarif Baqri.

27:01.665 --> 27:03.400
Now, it turns out he

27:03.401 --> 27:06.002
and President Sahi are cousins.

27:06.003 --> 27:09.939
Now, the family matriarch
is dying and is, uh,

27:09.940 --> 27:14.044
looking to say good-bye to
her nephew one last time.

27:14.045 --> 27:16.346
Sahi's been using back channels,

27:16.347 --> 27:20.116
trying to get India to cut him
loose, but so far no dice.

27:20.117 --> 27:21.918
So your idea is that we could

27:21.919 --> 27:23.753
put pressure on India to release him.

27:23.754 --> 27:26.156
And they're so grateful

27:26.157 --> 27:27.557
to get this one guy back,

27:27.558 --> 27:29.359
they agree to leverage
the Taliban on our behalf?

27:29.360 --> 27:31.861
Doesn't that seem somewhat naive?

27:31.862 --> 27:35.532
Well, it's a, it's an
unspoken exchange of favors,

27:35.533 --> 27:37.133
no money involved.

27:37.134 --> 27:39.235
- A loophole.
- Yeah.

27:39.236 --> 27:42.872
But how are we gonna get the
Indians to release Baqri?

27:42.873 --> 27:45.442
I haven't worked out that part yet.

27:45.443 --> 27:46.976
Yeah, well, that's a very big part.

27:46.977 --> 27:49.412
If you'd come to me beforehand,

27:49.413 --> 27:51.381
we could have worked out
a genuine proposal.

27:51.382 --> 27:52.882
I don't know what you're
hoping to accomplish,

27:52.883 --> 27:54.584
but not for the first time today,

27:54.585 --> 27:57.854
you're wasting the secretary's time.

27:57.855 --> 27:59.656
Okay, I think it's a
good time to take ten.

27:59.657 --> 28:02.024
(CLEARS THROAT) Let's chat.

28:05.495 --> 28:08.731
So is there something going on
that I should know about?

28:08.732 --> 28:10.934
Matt's been bypassing
the chain of command.

28:10.935 --> 28:12.635
I'll take care of it.

28:12.636 --> 28:15.004
Okay. Maybe, uh,

28:15.005 --> 28:18.073
in a more appropriate fashion.

28:19.008 --> 28:20.543
Sorry, ma'am.

28:20.544 --> 28:22.245
I'm just, you know, uh,

28:22.246 --> 28:25.048
still working the kinks out.

28:25.049 --> 28:27.349
No. I-I get it.

28:28.618 --> 28:33.356
You know, when I'd been
at CIA for about...

28:33.357 --> 28:35.959
I don't know, five years,
I was promoted

28:35.960 --> 28:37.293
to task force leader.

28:37.294 --> 28:39.729
That meant that I oversaw
a small department.

28:39.730 --> 28:41.631
I already knew most of the agents.

28:41.632 --> 28:45.802
And they were all very smart,

28:45.803 --> 28:48.938
talented people, great at their jobs.

28:48.939 --> 28:52.342
So I decided that I would stand back

28:52.343 --> 28:54.878
and let them do their work.

28:54.879 --> 28:58.414
I'd help out where I could but
otherwise leave them to it.

28:58.415 --> 29:00.683
And how'd that go?

29:00.684 --> 29:02.685
Huge disaster.

29:02.686 --> 29:04.888
No one knew what was expected of them,

29:04.889 --> 29:06.623
or what the boundaries were.

29:06.624 --> 29:09.092
Everyone was miserable.

29:09.093 --> 29:10.493
And in the end,

29:10.494 --> 29:13.563
I realized that, smart and
talented as they were,

29:13.564 --> 29:16.699
they still wanted a leader,
so I had to give myself

29:16.700 --> 29:18.568
permission to lead.

29:18.569 --> 29:20.670
Yes, ma'am.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.238
I understand.

29:22.239 --> 29:26.042
And I like Matt's crazy idea.

29:26.043 --> 29:28.877
Think you would, too, if you
weren't so pissed at him,

29:30.680 --> 29:35.484
That's why I'm tasking you
with making it work.

30:08.151 --> 30:09.852
Uh, look.

30:09.853 --> 30:12.822
I wanted to, uh, apologize

30:12.823 --> 30:14.524
for losing my cool

30:14.525 --> 30:16.259
in the staff meeting. That was wrong.

30:16.260 --> 30:18.895
You had a bad day.

30:18.896 --> 30:20.597
No.

30:20.598 --> 30:22.365
You did an end run around
me to the secretary

30:22.366 --> 30:24.400
about your friend Ashley,
and that ticked me off.

30:24.401 --> 30:26.736
If you had come to me,
I would have told you

30:26.737 --> 30:28.905
that I did look at her
résumé, and while she has

30:28.906 --> 30:30.139
a lot of great qualities,
she just didn't rise

30:30.140 --> 30:31.574
to the same level of expertise

30:31.575 --> 30:33.142
and experience as the
other five candidates.

30:33.143 --> 30:34.811
The secretary and I

30:34.812 --> 30:36.446
were in the break room together.

30:36.447 --> 30:39.315
I-I honestly didn't think
it was that big of a deal.

30:39.316 --> 30:41.751
Well, it was.

30:41.752 --> 30:44.554
Look, a week ago, you told me
I needed to step up if I wanted

30:44.555 --> 30:46.589
to do this job, and, as
tough as it was to hear,

30:46.590 --> 30:48.258
I appreciated the advice.

30:48.259 --> 30:49.759
But I don't think
either of us realized

30:49.760 --> 30:51.661
that meant me acting like your boss.

30:51.662 --> 30:53.796
Outside of here? I'm your buddy.

30:53.797 --> 30:57.132
In here? Your boss.

30:57.834 --> 30:59.369
Copy.

30:59.370 --> 31:01.271
You need to.

31:01.272 --> 31:02.839
Because if you go around me again...

31:02.840 --> 31:05.141
Unemployed buddy. I got it.

31:05.142 --> 31:07.442
Good.

31:08.945 --> 31:11.014
Also, I think I figured out

31:11.015 --> 31:14.683
how to make your crazy
Pakistan idea work.

31:16.819 --> 31:20.056
I called my counterparts in
India, and they were emphatic.

31:20.057 --> 31:22.325
They won't just give
Maarif Baqri to Pakistan

31:22.326 --> 31:24.294
without something in return,
so we started thinking about

31:24.295 --> 31:26.296
- what they might want.
- What they might want. And ever since

31:26.297 --> 31:28.498
India agreed to stricter
carbon emission protocols,

31:28.499 --> 31:30.533
they've been desperate

31:30.534 --> 31:33.770
- for clean, cheap, energy sources.
- Mostly solar panels.

31:33.771 --> 31:35.571
Solar panels, but guess what.

31:35.572 --> 31:37.073
Surprise, surprise,
China's gouging them.

31:37.074 --> 31:38.908
But then I remembered Rafaeli Solar.

31:38.909 --> 31:42.011
Yeah, after they lit up that
Lebanese refugee camp for us,

31:42.012 --> 31:44.480
we basically told them they
had a return favor coming.

31:44.481 --> 31:46.582
So I arranged for some
cheap loans for India

31:46.583 --> 31:48.484
through U.S. banks,
and they agreed to a contract

31:48.485 --> 31:50.253
with Rafaeli to build
these solar fields

31:50.254 --> 31:51.654
- in Andhra Pradesh for half - Half.

31:51.655 --> 31:53.022
What the Chinese are charging.

31:53.023 --> 31:54.691
And in exchange they'll release Baqri.

31:54.692 --> 31:56.959
- JAY: Okay, well, they're willing
- MATT: Sh...

31:56.960 --> 31:58.695
- to release him and it will...
- Yeah.

31:58.696 --> 32:00.330
- Coincidentally be around the same time
- Coincidentally.

32:00.331 --> 32:01.564
That these solar deals get made.

32:01.565 --> 32:02.965
Publicly, they'll say

32:02.966 --> 32:04.367
that Baqri was cooperating
with the government,

32:04.368 --> 32:05.601
and they're, you know,

32:05.602 --> 32:07.270
JAY AND MATT: commuting
his sentence in return.

32:07.271 --> 32:09.572
But I know what you're thinking:
How do we get the Pakistanis

32:09.573 --> 32:11.941
to keep up their end of
this unsigned agreement?

32:11.942 --> 32:14.243
The details of which no one
is willing to spell out,

32:14.244 --> 32:16.512
and most importantly,
aren't enforceable.

32:16.513 --> 32:17.780
So we were hoping...

32:17.781 --> 32:19.115
- That you...
- Might have...

32:19.116 --> 32:21.951
- JAY: The answer to that.

38:19.044 --> 38:21.546
Although, taking it with me

38:21.547 --> 38:23.481
just so that I don't come off
as hostile

38:23.482 --> 38:26.683
feels like I'm trying to appease him.

38:29.020 --> 38:32.423
And I don't have to do that anymore.

38:32.424 --> 38:34.025
(EXHALES)

38:34.026 --> 38:36.293
I should leave the box.

38:38.129 --> 38:40.298
I should leave the box, right?

38:40.299 --> 38:43.001
(CRYING): Right.

38:43.002 --> 38:45.502
Mom?

38:47.205 --> 38:48.439
Are you okay?

38:48.440 --> 38:50.941
I'm fine. I'm totally fine.

38:53.578 --> 38:54.779
- No, you're not.
- (SIGHS)

38:54.780 --> 38:58.149
Are you Cr... are you crying?

38:58.150 --> 38:59.651
I just... I think it's really...

38:59.652 --> 39:02.553
It's mostly the wine that's...

39:02.554 --> 39:04.522
- No, it's the boots.
- (SIGHS)

39:04.523 --> 39:06.691
Mom, I knew that you were upset.

39:06.692 --> 39:09.694
Well, I wasn't until...

39:09.695 --> 39:12.697
- until I saw the boots.
- Aw.

39:12.698 --> 39:15.900
And it's-it's not about
me missing Jareth.

39:15.901 --> 39:17.435
Or the boots.

39:17.436 --> 39:21.072
It's about me missing the time
when you were so happy.

39:21.073 --> 39:22.774
- Aw.
- And I know you are...

39:22.775 --> 39:25.777
totally going to be
happy again. I just...

39:25.778 --> 39:27.679
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

39:27.680 --> 39:30.315
he did only wear those boots, like...

39:30.316 --> 39:32.250
maybe once.

39:32.251 --> 39:35.320
He said they pinched his toes.

39:35.321 --> 39:37.387
Okay, now I really am over him.

39:41.159 --> 39:42.927
(LAUGHS)

39:42.928 --> 39:44.028
- Wow.
- (PHONE BUZZES)

39:44.029 --> 39:45.463
Yeah.

39:45.464 --> 39:46.731
Is that work?

39:46.732 --> 39:50.368
Well, sort of.

39:50.369 --> 39:52.236
Everybody's going to go see Daisy.

39:52.237 --> 39:54.172
- Aw.
- But I'm gonna go see her tomorrow, so...

39:54.173 --> 39:55.807
- No.
- let's finish up.

39:55.808 --> 39:57.675
Go now. W-We're almost done.

39:57.676 --> 40:01.145
And I'm fine. Go... go
hold the baby, Mom.

40:01.146 --> 40:04.315
Well, she's probably
not even gonna let us hold it.

40:04.316 --> 40:06.517
Just have to look at it
through the glass

40:06.518 --> 40:09.287
- Mom. Mom.
- In the nursery with everybody, so...

40:09.288 --> 40:11.922
- (SIGHS)
- Go look at a baby.

40:14.025 --> 40:16.594
It's okay. It's okay.

40:16.595 --> 40:19.364
- (SIGHS)
- I'm okay, I promise.

40:19.365 --> 40:21.013
DMITRI:
Well, thanks for having me over

40:21.014 --> 40:23.067
and kicking my ass at <i>Future Slayers.</i>

40:23.068 --> 40:24.969
I told you, man, you've got
to kill all the vampires

40:24.970 --> 40:26.270
before you activate the time jump.

40:26.271 --> 40:28.172
(LAUGHS)

40:28.173 --> 40:29.841
You know, if someone
told me a year ago

40:29.842 --> 40:31.275
that this is the life I'd be living,

40:31.276 --> 40:32.543
I wouldn't have believed it.

40:32.544 --> 40:35.713
- I still can't believe it.
- Well, believe it.

40:35.714 --> 40:38.515
- Good night, Alexander.
- Good night, Dr. McCord.

40:40.651 --> 40:42.586
- See you.
- See you.

40:45.223 --> 40:47.492
Alexander?

40:47.493 --> 40:50.128
Hi. (CHUCKLES)

40:50.129 --> 40:51.829
Were you having dinner with my dad?

40:51.830 --> 40:55.166
I, uh, was stuck on an assignment

40:55.167 --> 40:57.135
that's-that's due tomorrow.

40:57.136 --> 41:00.938
Uh, you are back from a trip?

41:00.939 --> 41:04.876
The trip that was gonna
be the rest of my life.

41:04.877 --> 41:07.478
Sorry. Uh, no.

41:07.479 --> 41:10.848
- Yeah, my fiancé and I, we...
- Oh.

41:10.849 --> 41:14.018
I'm so sorry to hear that.
Are you okay?

41:14.019 --> 41:16.054
(CHUCKLES)

41:16.055 --> 41:18.923
Could be the wine talking, but yeah.

41:18.924 --> 41:20.591
I don't know.

41:20.592 --> 41:23.394
Well, it's his loss.

41:23.395 --> 41:26.030
That's... that's for sure.

41:26.031 --> 41:29.266
Thanks.

41:31.002 --> 41:33.970
Take care, Stevie.

41:35.673 --> 41:37.874
Hey, um...

41:38.609 --> 41:40.978
Do you want to get some coffee?

41:40.979 --> 41:43.281
It's just, if I go to bed
like this, I'll...

41:43.282 --> 41:45.750
get a headache.

41:45.751 --> 41:47.118
I... I can't.

41:47.119 --> 41:49.754
Caffeine this late,
I'll be up all night.

41:49.755 --> 41:51.956
Drink?

41:51.957 --> 41:54.459
(CHUCKLES) Keep the party going.

41:54.460 --> 41:56.561
I really can't.

41:56.562 --> 41:59.196
I have to be up very early.

42:01.532 --> 42:05.002
Maybe another time?

42:05.003 --> 42:08.306
- Can I see your phone?
- What?

42:08.307 --> 42:10.840
Can you unlock... unlock your phone?

42:19.917 --> 42:21.518
Now you have my number.

42:22.253 --> 42:25.522
Call me sometime.

42:33.464 --> 42:35.098
