00:01.301 --> 00:03.237
Tonight on "Shark Tank"...

00:03.237 --> 00:04.605
Sharks, I stole a spoon

00:04.605 --> 00:06.507
and turned it
into money-making madness.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.709
Ahh! <i>- Y Chihuahua, caramba!</i>

00:08.709 --> 00:11.178
Oh, my God!
That is very cool.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.146
Say hello to HiccAway.

00:13.146 --> 00:15.649
The only scientific
hiccup remedy.

00:16.617 --> 00:17.918
Please let it work.

00:17.918 --> 00:21.054
I turned my trauma
into triumph.

00:21.054 --> 00:23.190
I turned my bullies
into bucks.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.825
Yeah!

00:24.825 --> 00:26.860
This is not a typical
swimsuit company.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.695
I don't think
we've ever had anybody

00:28.695 --> 00:31.532
in 13 years of "Shark Tank"
stand on that carpet

00:31.532 --> 00:32.866
that have achieved
what you have.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.168
You're half courageous,
half crazy.

00:35.168 --> 00:38.171
I really want to take
this business as far as I can

00:38.171 --> 00:39.339
and reach
the full potential.

00:39.339 --> 00:41.508
It's hard to make
Mr. Wonderful humble,

00:41.508 --> 00:43.043
but I am humbled.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.011
You're a rock star.

00:44.011 --> 00:45.112
You will be sitting here

00:45.112 --> 00:46.547
in a couple of years
in one of these chairs.

00:55.789 --> 00:59.426
First into the Tank is a product
born from a personal need.

01:09.269 --> 01:11.872
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Tania Speaks.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.541
I'm 19 years old,
from Baltimore, Maryland,

01:14.541 --> 01:17.044
and I'm here seeking $400,000

01:17.044 --> 01:19.212
for 10% equity
in my company.

01:19.212 --> 01:20.647
Oh.

01:20.647 --> 01:23.283
In elementary school,
everyone looks forward

01:23.283 --> 01:25.319
to playing outside
during recess.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.720
Me too.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.422
Until on the playground,

01:28.422 --> 01:32.993
I was bullied for something
I couldn't control and hated --

01:32.993 --> 01:36.597
my bushy, thick,
unruly eyebrows.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.399
The torture of my peers
was exhausting

01:39.399 --> 01:43.604
until I finally decided
to make my haters my motivators

01:43.604 --> 01:45.906
and embrace my beautiful brows.

01:45.906 --> 01:49.977
I searched for brow products,
but nothing worked for me.

01:49.977 --> 01:51.278
So what did I do?

01:51.278 --> 01:53.313
Decided to make my own.

01:53.313 --> 01:56.617
Introducing Tania Speaks Organic Skincare,

01:56.617 --> 01:59.353
a powerful plant-based brow gel

01:59.353 --> 02:03.590
that tames thick brows
and grows thin brows.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.792
It's organic, lightweight,

02:05.792 --> 02:07.427
contains no harsh chemicals,

02:07.427 --> 02:08.962
and actually works

02:08.962 --> 02:11.031
for brow growth and styling.

02:11.031 --> 02:14.034
And it's not just
our brow gel thriving.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.770
We created other products,
like our foaming cleanser,

02:16.770 --> 02:19.573
resurfacing toner,
facial moisturizer,

02:19.573 --> 02:22.476
and for the guys,
the organic beard oil.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.578
Our products
are carefully formulated

02:24.578 --> 02:27.681
with natural ingredients
like aloe vera,

02:27.681 --> 02:30.417
carrot seed,
and oatmeal vanilla honey.

02:30.417 --> 02:33.854
I turned my trauma
into triumph.

02:33.854 --> 02:37.824
I turned my bullies into bucks
by blending innovation,

02:37.824 --> 02:41.161
beauty, and confidence
in one organic package.

02:41.161 --> 02:45.165
So, Sharks, who's ready
to join me on my mission

02:45.165 --> 02:49.436
to inspire everyone
to embrace the skin they're in?

02:49.436 --> 02:52.673
In front of you are your own
products to try for yourself.

02:54.141 --> 02:56.443
So, now,
you made the comment

02:56.443 --> 02:59.880
that the brow gel
tames thick brows...
Yes.

02:59.880 --> 03:03.250
...but also helps
thin ones grow.
Yes.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.752
Can you explain to us why?

03:05.752 --> 03:08.388
The brow gel
has a dual purpose.

03:08.388 --> 03:11.324
If you just want to tame
your thick brows, like mine,

03:11.324 --> 03:14.027
you only apply it once a day,
just to style them,

03:14.027 --> 03:16.496
lay them in place.
But if you want growth,

03:16.496 --> 03:18.465
you have to be consistent
and apply it twice a day.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.033
So you sleep in the gel,

03:20.033 --> 03:21.301
let it stimulate the growth
while you're sleeping.

03:21.301 --> 03:23.036
What agent helps
the hair growth?

03:23.036 --> 03:24.404
So what we have is the sap

03:24.404 --> 03:27.274
from the aloe vera plant
and vitamin E.

03:27.274 --> 03:30.410
The aloe vera plant is normally
used for cuts, burns.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.345
So when I was making
my formula,

03:32.345 --> 03:34.948
I thought maybe it could heal
my eyebrows,

03:34.948 --> 03:36.783
because I cut my brows.

03:36.783 --> 03:40.587
I could not take it anymore.
I cried to my mom every day,

03:40.587 --> 03:43.090
"Can I please
get my brows serviced?"

03:43.090 --> 03:46.126
I wanted these bushy
caterpillars off of my face.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.028
And she would not allow me.
She said,

03:48.028 --> 03:50.464
"You're too young
to get your brows done."

03:50.464 --> 03:53.633
So I decided to cut them myself
with a sharp razor.

03:53.633 --> 03:56.036
I had to go to the hospital.
I had to get stitches.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.404
It was
a traumatic experience.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.039
Wow.
I went to the stores,

03:59.039 --> 04:00.807
tried to find something
to grow them back,

04:00.807 --> 04:02.242
and nothing worked.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.311
And so I just started
researching natural ingredients,

04:04.311 --> 04:06.780
like what works to grow hair,
what works --

04:06.780 --> 04:08.115
Good for you.
And it was just very random.

04:08.115 --> 04:09.850
And I would actually
just bring stuff home,

04:09.850 --> 04:12.352
any type of ingredient, and
I would just mix it together.

04:12.352 --> 04:14.621
And that formula
started to work for me,

04:14.621 --> 04:17.124
just the aloe vera plant
that was in my house.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.692
Mm. That's what it feels like.
Vitamin E
that was in my house.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.894
I didn't have to do much.
So you're, like,
your own clinical study?

04:20.894 --> 04:23.697
Basically. I like to think
of myself as a little chemist.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.665
And today is the --
Tania, with all this work
and all this effort,

04:25.665 --> 04:26.700
how are sales going?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.535
Sales are amazing.

04:28.535 --> 04:31.738
Okay, so last year, I did
a million dollars in sales.

04:31.738 --> 04:32.973
- Whoa!
- What?!

04:32.973 --> 04:35.008
And you're 19?!
19.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.676
Let me borrow something.
$1 million?

04:36.676 --> 04:38.712
$1 million in sales last year,

04:38.712 --> 04:41.715
and this year,
we have done $1.4 million.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.683
Yeah!
How are you doing that?

04:43.683 --> 04:44.918
Year to date?
How are you doing that?

04:44.918 --> 04:47.821
All of our sales
are fully online.
What?!

04:47.821 --> 04:50.123
How I started
was sharing my story.
Oh, my God.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.591
I went to vending events.

04:51.591 --> 04:52.859
I went to trade shows.

04:52.859 --> 04:55.195
I even sold
in my high-school bathroom.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.998
I had the line wrapping
around the school.
Oh, that's awesome.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.533
And they would buy it.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.101
So amazing!
They would really buy it.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.370
And so I started my website.

05:03.370 --> 05:05.705
I made everything myself
and got it going.

05:05.705 --> 05:08.175
You've got to be making
a fortune if it's all online.
And what about school?

05:08.175 --> 05:10.177
So last year,
I netted $700,000.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.379
Oh, my God!
Yeah!

05:12.379 --> 05:14.414
- Not only that. There's more.
- Holy cow!

05:14.414 --> 05:16.950
$700,000?
You're 19 years old?

05:16.950 --> 05:18.618
Yes. Yes.
What does your mother say?

05:18.618 --> 05:20.921
Kevin, Kevin. Get out of the
chair. Let her sit there.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.656
No kidding.
You can sit in my chair.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.391
What does your mother say?
What does your mother say?

05:24.391 --> 05:25.659
- What did my mom say?
- Yeah.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.260
She said,
"Buy me another house."
She loved it.

05:27.260 --> 05:30.397
She's like, "I am the proudest
mom in the world."
Wow.

05:30.397 --> 05:31.832
What is the cost
to make it,

05:31.832 --> 05:32.899
and what price
do you sell it at?

05:32.899 --> 05:34.868
It's amazing.
For the brow gel,

05:34.868 --> 05:37.204
it costs us $1.10 to make.

05:37.204 --> 05:39.272
And we sell it for $29.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.907
Oh!
Yeah, Tania!

05:40.907 --> 05:42.843
Highway robbery.
Shame on you.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.644
That's like talking dirty.
Whoa!

05:44.644 --> 05:46.446
Tania, how'd
you get started?

05:46.446 --> 05:48.548
So, my mom didn't have any money
to give me.

05:48.548 --> 05:50.350
So she actually made
the investment

05:50.350 --> 05:53.086
and took out $10,000
from her 401
Wow.

05:53.086 --> 05:56.122
And I was able to pay her
back immediately.

05:56.122 --> 05:58.592
And so I feel very proud
about that.

05:58.592 --> 06:01.361
In regards to this,
how do you protect yourself

06:01.361 --> 06:04.164
against,
obviously, the trolls...
I was wondering about that.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.266
...the legal trolls
who say there's claims?
Yeah.

06:06.266 --> 06:07.300
How do you do that
in this world?

06:07.300 --> 06:08.668
Well, that's
what I was wondering.

06:08.668 --> 06:12.405
To be able to make the claim
that it helps thin brows,

06:12.405 --> 06:15.242
have you done any third-party
accredited lab testing?

06:15.242 --> 06:16.610
We have not done that yet.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.578
If not, you need to, right?
Okay.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.380
Because the reality
of this world is,

06:20.380 --> 06:22.249
when you're climbing up
the ladder,

06:22.249 --> 06:25.585
everybody just roots for you
and holds the ladder for you.

06:25.585 --> 06:28.388
When you get to the top,
people you've never seen before

06:28.388 --> 06:30.523
in your entire life
will take potshots

06:30.523 --> 06:32.692
and try to pull the ladder
out from underneath you.

06:32.692 --> 06:34.561
You make a claim, right,

06:34.561 --> 06:36.730
and you don't have the research,
they will sue you.

06:36.730 --> 06:40.567
And so you've got to be really,
really, really careful.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.969
It's insane how good you are
at what you're doing.

06:42.969 --> 06:44.471
And if this was
my core competency,

06:44.471 --> 06:46.573
I'd be all over it to help you,
but it's not.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.441
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

06:48.441 --> 06:49.876
Thank you so much.

06:49.876 --> 06:52.178
And that's why I'm here --
because I'm only 19.

06:52.178 --> 06:54.748
So there's only
so much information I have,

06:54.748 --> 06:56.249
and I really need help.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.919
You're only 19,
but you're rich.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.020
Yeah.
I mean, it's --

07:00.020 --> 07:01.755
I don't think
we've ever had anybody

07:01.755 --> 07:03.256
in 13 years of "Shark Tank"

07:03.256 --> 07:06.293
stand on that carpet that
have achieved what you have.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.395
But, you know, Tania,
I don't think I'm your Shark.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.397
This is -- This is not
a product category

07:10.397 --> 07:11.865
where I can be
a spokesperson.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.233
I mean,
I try and do my deals

07:13.233 --> 07:16.503
where I can actually
speak out and support...

07:16.503 --> 07:18.338
...you know,
what the product is.

07:18.338 --> 07:20.573
It's hard to make
Mr. Wonderful humble,

07:20.573 --> 07:22.242
but I am humbled.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.576
Thank you so much.
I'm amazed.

07:23.576 --> 07:25.011
But I'm out.

07:25.011 --> 07:27.147
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.449
I don't see,
with that amount of cash

07:29.449 --> 07:31.451
that you've accrued
from your business,

07:31.451 --> 07:34.421
why you would have any need
for any Shark.

07:34.421 --> 07:37.490
You've done well so far.
So why would I even advise you?

07:37.490 --> 07:39.793
But because I don't feel
like I could help you,

07:39.793 --> 07:42.395
and I really don't think
you need the help, I'm out.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.630
Thank you.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.232
I am so damn proud of you.
I don't even know you.

07:46.232 --> 07:47.267
The fact about bullies --

07:47.267 --> 07:49.235
People are gonna find ways
to bully you.

07:49.235 --> 07:52.439
I don't care if it's
your age, sex, gender, hair.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.407
You know, having hair,
not having hair, bushy hair.

07:54.407 --> 07:57.811
But you know what? For you to be
able to even overlook that,

07:57.811 --> 07:59.713
overcome that, and then say,
"By the way,

07:59.713 --> 08:01.414
you know what you
were bullying me about?

08:01.414 --> 08:03.016
Why don't you buy this?"

08:03.016 --> 08:07.120
I mean,
it is absolutely incredible.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.855
You're a rock star.
You will be sitting here

08:08.855 --> 08:11.324
in a couple of years
in one of these chairs.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.294
But there's no place here
for me to add value,

08:14.294 --> 08:16.596
and I really wish I could.

08:16.596 --> 08:18.131
I'm proud of you.
I'm out.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.499
Thank you.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.302
If you had said that you knew
that this works,

08:22.302 --> 08:25.138
that you had trials,
that we knew the efficacy,

08:25.138 --> 08:26.606
I would have given you
an offer,

08:26.606 --> 08:28.541
but you don't have
that proof yet.

08:28.541 --> 08:29.743
So it's early for me.

08:29.743 --> 08:33.279
I'll be watching,
and I'll be a customer.

08:33.279 --> 08:35.915
But at this moment,
I'm out.

08:35.915 --> 08:38.618
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

08:38.618 --> 08:41.121
Find a lab
and do that testing.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.323
Thank you, Tania,
but we're all out.
Thank you.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.891
Okay, but I still thank you

All Sharks have passed
on investing

12:30.817 --> 12:32.518
in Tania's brow gel company,

12:32.518 --> 12:34.120
Tania Speaks,

12:34.120 --> 12:35.088
but Mark has

12:35.088 --> 12:36.155
something left to say.

12:36.155 --> 12:38.491
Wait, wait. Tania, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.126
Whoa.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.462
Honestly, I thought somebody
was gonna make you an offer.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.863
You know, when I said,
"Okay,

12:43.863 --> 12:45.832
this isn't my wheelhouse
and everything,"

12:45.832 --> 12:48.134
but my wheelhouse
is helping guide

12:48.134 --> 12:50.370
amazing entrepreneurs
like yourself

12:50.370 --> 12:51.771
and helping them deal

12:51.771 --> 12:54.007
with the legal land mines
that come along.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.742
Maybe I can't help
with eyebrow cream

12:55.742 --> 12:58.945
and some of the other stuff,
but I can give you guidance

12:58.945 --> 13:01.814
that can help you avoid
a lot of the pitfalls.

13:01.814 --> 13:03.583
So I'm gonna make you
an offer.

13:03.583 --> 13:04.784
Alright?
Okay.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.452
I'm gonna offer you
the $400,000.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.887
I want 20%.

13:07.887 --> 13:10.323
But there's also two
other contingencies.

13:10.323 --> 13:13.926
I have a daughter who's 14...

13:13.926 --> 13:16.095
and a daughter who's 17.

13:16.095 --> 13:18.431
Alyssa and Alexis.
And I want them to meet you,

13:18.431 --> 13:21.100
and I want them
to learn from you.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.303
And maybe you'll even
learn something from them.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.973
So those are my two
contingencies,

13:26.973 --> 13:29.208
and that's my offer.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.778
Thank you. I'm honored
to meet your daughters.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.247
I really would love that.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.082
My counter...

13:36.082 --> 13:39.018
is $400,000 for 15%.

13:41.287 --> 13:42.588
Oh, Mark, you've met
your match.

13:42.588 --> 13:45.058
Alright, I'm a sucker.
You got a deal.
Yeah!

13:45.058 --> 13:46.726
Yay!

13:46.726 --> 13:48.161
Yay.
Thank you!

13:48.161 --> 13:49.262
- Congrats.
- Oh, my God.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.030
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.

13:51.030 --> 13:53.333
Thank you so much, Tania.
You're amazing.
Thank you.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.901
I'm so excited. Thank you.
Me too. Me too.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.736
Thank you, everyone, for your
advice. I really appreciate it.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.137
Congrats, Tania.
You're the fire.

13:58.137 --> 14:00.306
Thank you. Thank you!

14:01.708 --> 14:02.842
I'm just so excited!

14:02.842 --> 14:04.544
I can't believe this
just happened to me.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.346
Like...

14:06.346 --> 14:07.947
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.

14:07.947 --> 14:10.016
I couldn't have asked
for a better outcome.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.919
Like, it was amazing. They even
said I would sit there one day

14:12.919 --> 14:14.120
and be a Shark.

14:14.120 --> 14:17.190
Like, that's the highest
compliment I've ever had.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.860
I have never seen you
emotional in an offer.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.662
What was that about?
Well, when I talk
about my kids, yeah.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.264
I saw my daughters,
and my son, for that matter,

14:25.264 --> 14:27.433
you know, in her,
and, you know,

14:27.433 --> 14:29.602
every father has aspirations
for their kids.

14:29.602 --> 14:32.939
You know, if I can get her
to connect to my kids,

14:32.939 --> 14:34.774
that's more important
than the money involved.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.276
So that's
why I came back in.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.115
In Season 12, Aaron Powell

14:42.115 --> 14:43.483
made a deal
with Barbara Corcoran

14:43.483 --> 14:45.985
for his cargo bikes
for families, Bunch Bikes.

14:45.985 --> 14:47.153
You got a deal.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.321
Yeah!
Yo!

14:48.321 --> 14:50.022
Let's see
what he's up to now.

14:50.022 --> 14:52.725
After signing the deal
with Barbara, I expected

14:52.725 --> 14:54.927
it would be life-changing.
But what I didn't expect

14:54.927 --> 14:57.497
was that I would get two Sharks
for the price of one.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.266
When Robert saw that I had made
the deal with Bunch Bikes,

15:00.266 --> 15:01.801
he was so jealous.

15:01.801 --> 15:03.403
He begged me
to come into the deal,

15:03.403 --> 15:04.804
so I gave him half the deal.

15:04.804 --> 15:07.373
Robert was a perfect partner
for this deal.

15:07.373 --> 15:09.175
He loved the brand.
He owned two bikes.

15:09.175 --> 15:11.477
Robert's gonna help
this company grow

15:11.477 --> 15:13.346
because he knows how
to do licensing deals.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.881
I'm gonna give straight talk,

15:14.881 --> 15:16.416
see what's wrong
with the business,

15:16.416 --> 15:18.184
and fix it
before it's a real problem.

15:18.184 --> 15:21.587
Having two Sharks that are
both enthusiastic about bikes,

15:21.587 --> 15:24.123
they're using the product
and giving me feedback.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.092
Robert's riding around
with his twins,

15:26.092 --> 15:27.794
Barbara's riding around
Central Park.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.395
It's great to have investors

15:29.395 --> 15:31.564
that are also users
of the product.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.900
Unfortunately, I wasn't
on the panel

15:33.900 --> 15:35.902
the day you came
into the Shark Tank.

15:35.902 --> 15:39.005
If I was, there would be
no Barbara on this call.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.339
Oh, really?

15:40.339 --> 15:42.708
After "Shark Tank"
aired, our sales exploded.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.911
One week after airing,
we received a purchase order

15:44.911 --> 15:47.046
for a literal truckload
of bikes.

15:47.046 --> 15:50.316
Since "Shark Tank,"
we've made $1.8 million.

15:50.316 --> 15:51.784
After "Shark Tank,"
we got noticed

15:51.784 --> 15:53.553
by a company
called Lucca & Livvy,

15:53.553 --> 15:55.288
a premium
exotic beverage company

15:55.288 --> 15:56.923
that uses cargo bikes
to sell products

15:56.923 --> 15:59.125
at local markets.
Over the next five years,

15:59.125 --> 16:00.793
they're going to buy 500 bikes,

16:00.793 --> 16:03.429
amounting to about $2 million
worth of sales.

16:03.429 --> 16:06.065
Barbara, thank you for having me
as part of the deal.

16:06.065 --> 16:10.803
Now let's go out there and
achieve world bike domination.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.038
Whoo!

16:12.038 --> 16:13.473
Whee!

16:13.473 --> 16:15.908
What I love most about biking
with my family

16:15.908 --> 16:18.211
is the memories
that we've created together.

16:18.211 --> 16:21.314
We've become more connected
with our city and our community.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.982
What I would tell
other entrepreneurs

16:22.982 --> 16:25.251
is that it's possible
to change your path.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.285
I used to be a teacher.

16:26.285 --> 16:27.753
That's what I'd always
wanted to do.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.288
But when family
came into the picture,

16:29.288 --> 16:31.591
I took a leap of faith
and made it work.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.494
I'm showing my kids that
if you dream it, you can do it.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.863
And getting them to see that
in real time

16:36.863 --> 16:38.431
makes this all worth it.

Hi baby, Huggies here.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.616
That weird thing you’re tasting,
it’s called skin.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.150
It’s super sensitive.

18:38.150 --> 18:41.587
But with your mom here, we’ll
help keep it clean and healthy.

18:41.587 --> 18:44.056
Huggies. We got you, baby.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.310
to have your cake
and still look great.

20:52.384 --> 20:54.120
Hi.
My name is Leila Shams.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.055
I'm a fashion designer
from Los Angeles.

20:56.055 --> 20:58.190
And I'm here seeking $500,000

20:58.190 --> 21:00.893
in exchange for 10%
of my company.

21:00.893 --> 21:04.096
Sharks, we all want to look
amazing in a swimsuit,

21:04.096 --> 21:07.166
and when we don't,
we blame our bodies.

21:07.166 --> 21:10.369
Well, it's time we start
blaming the real enemies.

21:10.369 --> 21:13.205
First up, the bikini.

21:13.205 --> 21:17.476
This flimsy thing
is doing us no favors. Ugh!

21:17.476 --> 21:21.013
And next, we have
the typical one-piece.

21:21.013 --> 21:24.416
No support. They're either
too short or too long.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.619
No, thank you.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.687
And the suits
that do have support

21:28.687 --> 21:30.322
like to hide your curves.

21:30.322 --> 21:32.958
So much fabric.
So much draping.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.094
Oh, it hurts my eyes!

21:36.462 --> 21:38.330
Sharks,
I believe that your suit

21:38.330 --> 21:40.866
should support
and enhance your body.

21:40.866 --> 21:44.570
And that's why I created TA3,

21:44.570 --> 21:47.273
the world's
most flattering swimsuit.

21:52.278 --> 21:53.546
Simply pull...

21:54.747 --> 21:56.515
Oh Sorry.
Ooh. Sorry, sorry.

21:59.752 --> 22:00.853
Wait.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.221
Best part
of the presentation.

22:02.221 --> 22:03.622
Oh, God.

22:03.622 --> 22:05.858
The world's most flattering
swimsuit. What I do say next?

22:05.858 --> 22:07.660
- "Don't believe me?"
- "Don't believe me, Sharks."

22:07.660 --> 22:09.528
Okay. Start over? Okay.
Pick it up -- Pick it up
from the previous thing.

22:09.528 --> 22:10.496
Yeah, don't worry.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.933
And that's why
I created TA3,

22:13.933 --> 22:16.569
the world's
most flattering swimsuit.

22:16.569 --> 22:19.438
Don't believe me, Sharks?
See it for yourself.

22:19.438 --> 22:22.842
Simply pull the ties
on the back of the suit...
Wow.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.644
Yowza.
...to reveal a gorgeous,
sculpted shape.

22:25.644 --> 22:27.112
And that's it.
Oh.

22:27.112 --> 22:31.016
Let the compression and lacing
do the hard work for you.

22:31.016 --> 22:34.386
Sharks, my suits are not
just a piece of clothing --

22:34.386 --> 22:35.788
They're freedom.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.858
Freedom to relax
and indulge

22:38.858 --> 22:41.493
without swimsuit stress.

22:41.493 --> 22:47.166
So, Sharks, who wants to suit up
and cinch in a deal with me?

22:47.166 --> 22:48.367
- Great job.
- Yay!

22:48.367 --> 22:50.502
Great job, great job.
Terrific.

22:50.502 --> 22:54.673
Is TA3 specifically designed
for Rubenesque women?

22:54.673 --> 22:56.842
No, it's size-inclusive.

22:56.842 --> 23:00.145
So, right now,
I offer extra small to 3X.

23:00.145 --> 23:01.780
It's thick-enough material,

23:01.780 --> 23:03.415
so it's gonna suck you in
a bit,

23:03.415 --> 23:04.617
which is nice.
Exactly.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.352
We all want suck-in.
Exactly.

23:06.352 --> 23:09.154
And then, here, you can do it
to as tight as you want,

23:09.154 --> 23:11.156
but it's gonna help
accentuate your waist.

23:11.156 --> 23:12.758
Exactly.
Right? Okay.

23:12.758 --> 23:14.026
So you did a good job
of that.

23:14.026 --> 23:15.294
Thank you so much.
It's nice.

23:15.294 --> 23:17.663
It's really
the interior construction,

23:17.663 --> 23:19.999
where there's
double-layer lining

23:19.999 --> 23:22.868
along the waist and the front.
So it's a corset, right?

23:22.868 --> 23:25.771
Yes, it's similar to a corset,
but you'll never find a corset

23:25.771 --> 23:28.440
that is one piece.
A corset is always --

23:28.440 --> 23:30.676
It just goes to here.
Just a thing
to jam in your ribs.

23:30.676 --> 23:33.279
Yeah, and they're woven.
They're non-stretch.

23:33.279 --> 23:34.947
Oh, this is very nice.
So these are stretch.

23:34.947 --> 23:37.383
Let's say you've solved
a problem here. Okay?
Uh-huh.

23:37.383 --> 23:41.487
I want to get into this,
$500,000 for 10% imputes
a $5 million valuation.

23:41.487 --> 23:43.155
Yep.
Now, what would tell me

23:43.155 --> 23:45.357
that you've solved
a problem would be sales.

23:45.357 --> 23:46.825
Yep. And I have sales.

23:46.825 --> 23:48.661
I've been in business
for 13 months,

23:48.661 --> 23:51.630
and I've done $1.4 million.
Whoa.

23:51.630 --> 23:53.432
- Good for you. Nice.
- Good job.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.501
Thank you.
What did you make
on that $1.4 million?

23:55.501 --> 23:56.735
$800,000 gross.

23:56.735 --> 23:59.171
That's your profit?
And $500,000 operating.

23:59.171 --> 24:01.206
How did you do that?
Wow.

24:01.206 --> 24:02.441
I'm amazing.

24:02.441 --> 24:05.010
Like, $500,000-
into-the-bank-type profit?

24:05.010 --> 24:06.879
Yeah. Well, I put most of it
into inventory.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.514
Back in inventory, yeah.
Yeah.

24:08.514 --> 24:11.116
Now, Leila, I want to understand
your background a little bit.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.852
I've been a fashion designer
for over 20 years.

24:13.852 --> 24:16.221
I was a design director
in New York

24:16.221 --> 24:18.290
for multimillion
and billion-dollar brands.

24:18.290 --> 24:22.161
So DKNY Jeans,
Express, Bebe.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.762
So I worked for
those kind of, like, big...
Okay.

24:23.762 --> 24:25.030
So you've been around.

24:25.030 --> 24:26.265
So who are you selling to?

24:26.265 --> 24:27.433
And how are you selling it
to them?

24:27.433 --> 24:28.834
Direct to consumer.
Retail? Direct?

24:28.834 --> 24:31.170
I'm only direct to consumer,
so I sell through my website.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.439
So what did you do
to get those sales?

24:33.439 --> 24:34.773
I do a couple things.

24:34.773 --> 24:36.742
The first thing
was Instagram ads,

24:36.742 --> 24:38.377
but what's been amazing
is TikTok.

24:38.377 --> 24:40.245
People see it, and they're just
like

24:40.245 --> 24:42.348
You know?
So, I mean, I had a customer --

24:42.348 --> 24:44.116
I didn't pay a dime for this --

24:44.116 --> 24:47.019
and she got 4 million views.
I sold out. Pssh!

24:47.019 --> 24:49.488
Now, do you have a patent
on this lining?

24:49.488 --> 24:51.490
I noticed. There's a different
lining that you mentioned.
Yes.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.325
I have a patent pending.
You do have a patent pending?

24:53.325 --> 24:54.827
Yes.
So, Leila,

24:54.827 --> 24:57.463
it's difficult
to do any clothing, right?

24:57.463 --> 25:01.600
So what is your return rate off
of the sales of the $1.4?

25:01.600 --> 25:04.003
My return rate is 20%,
which is...

25:04.003 --> 25:06.138
20%.
...pretty on par...

25:06.138 --> 25:08.407
For a bathing suit.
...if not a little better,
for a bathing suit.

25:08.407 --> 25:09.942
I think that's
a little low.

25:09.942 --> 25:12.745
It's pretty low.
Usually, women buy two sizes,

25:12.745 --> 25:14.646
and then they return the one
that doesn't fit.
Right.

25:14.646 --> 25:18.584
My retail is quite high,
which doesn't make people

25:18.584 --> 25:20.386
that enthusiastic
to buy a ton of them.

25:20.386 --> 25:22.154
What does it sell for?
We don't even know.

25:22.154 --> 25:23.655
What does a bathing suit cost?
Let's talk about your business.

25:23.655 --> 25:25.024
What's the sales?
What's your margins?

25:25.024 --> 25:26.558
What's your cost landed?
All that.

25:26.558 --> 25:29.128
So my cost altogether
is $45.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.929
Okay,
what do you sell it for?

25:30.929 --> 25:33.766
$178.
Whoa.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.868
I invested in a swimwear company
called Raising Wild.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.470
Uh-huh.
You know what
the overreaching lesson

25:38.470 --> 25:39.605
I learned?

25:39.605 --> 25:41.206
That we couldn't
make the customers happy.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.509
We had a return rate
of about 25%.

25:43.509 --> 25:46.245
By the time we developed
one suit season

25:46.245 --> 25:49.448
and nipped and tucked it,
we were into a new color line.

25:49.448 --> 25:52.851
We had so much excess inventory
that we could not unload.

25:52.851 --> 25:54.219
I think
you're courageous,

25:54.219 --> 25:55.554
now that I've walked
down that road.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.923
You're half courageous,
half crazy.

25:57.923 --> 25:58.824
Okay?

25:58.824 --> 26:00.092
But, for me,
I'm going to go out

26:00.092 --> 26:02.494
because I just don't want to
go down that road once again.

26:02.494 --> 26:03.962
Okay, but I will say...
Okay.

26:03.962 --> 26:06.465
...this is not a typical
swimsuit company at all.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.934
I believe you.
It's shaping swimwear.

26:08.934 --> 26:10.936
I see that.
And I don't think
you would find those problems

26:10.936 --> 26:12.237
in the shapewear industry.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.205
- You know what?
- Perhaps.

26:13.205 --> 26:14.473
Congratulations on your success.

26:14.473 --> 26:15.741
I mean, it's enormous.
Thank you.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.676
I mean, just what you've
been able to accomplish

26:17.676 --> 26:20.779
in such a short period of time
and make money at it.

26:20.779 --> 26:23.415
Amazing progress,
but it's just not a fit for me.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.117
So I'm out.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.652
Okay.

26:26.652 --> 26:28.487
This is not a product category
I'm going to invest in,

26:28.487 --> 26:30.022
because I have no connection with it.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.256
I have an Adonis body.

26:31.256 --> 26:34.059
I don't need any compression.
I'm pretty happy.

26:34.059 --> 26:35.561
Listen, I'm out.
Sorry.

26:37.229 --> 26:40.132
What are you thinking to do
with the money?

26:40.132 --> 26:41.967
Buy more inventory.

26:41.967 --> 26:43.669
I've been sold out
almost the whole time

26:43.669 --> 26:46.738
I've been in business, so I want
to be prepared for next year.

26:46.738 --> 26:48.273
I'm not going through this
again.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.642
I want to have
all the inventory

26:50.642 --> 26:53.011
I need to meet my demand,
and my demand is huge.

26:53.011 --> 26:54.379
I'm gonna look at my phone
after this,

26:54.379 --> 26:57.182
and I'm telling you,
I've probably sold out again.

26:57.182 --> 26:58.884
I've got to tell you
about this inventory thing.

26:58.884 --> 27:00.752
So, Barbara touched on it
a little.

27:00.752 --> 27:03.188
Inventory has killed
more people in our business

27:03.188 --> 27:05.457
than smallpox
have killed people.
Right.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.159
Once you get to a level of,
let's say,

27:07.159 --> 27:09.094
you were doing
$100 million a year...

27:09.094 --> 27:10.629
Yeah.
...and $5 million of that

27:10.629 --> 27:14.566
was extra inventory,
times 10 years,

27:14.566 --> 27:16.735
now you have $50 million
of excess inventory

27:16.735 --> 27:18.337
that's taking up
warehouse space.

27:18.337 --> 27:21.006
It's seasonal, and you have to
have what we call a second door.

27:21.006 --> 27:23.809
That means a T. J. Maxx
or Burlington to get rid of it.

27:23.809 --> 27:27.146
And when you say that you paid
$12 for it initially, they say,

27:27.146 --> 27:28.981
"I'll give you 75 cents."
Right.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.649
What that does is,
that kills

27:30.649 --> 27:32.317
all of your profit
over the years.

27:32.317 --> 27:35.521
So I'm really worried
about the inventory.

27:35.521 --> 27:36.955
So I'm out.

27:36.955 --> 27:39.191
Oh!
I can't believe this!

27:39.191 --> 27:41.160
Wait, there's still
one Sharkette left.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.061
Talk to me, Lori.

27:43.061 --> 27:46.932
Listen, I think you are
a great designer.

27:46.932 --> 27:49.334
If you get a patent,
I think your play

27:49.334 --> 27:53.105
is going to a major player
and licensing that technology,

27:53.105 --> 27:55.941
that thought in all sorts
of different outfits.

27:55.941 --> 27:57.776
I would never do that.
You would never do that?

27:57.776 --> 28:00.112
No.
Well, unfortunately,
that would be my vision.

28:00.112 --> 28:01.580
So I'm sorry.

28:01.580 --> 28:04.249
I'm out.

28:04.249 --> 28:05.817
Thank you very much, Leila.
Leila, thank you very much.

28:05.817 --> 28:07.286
Thank you.
Good luck,

28:07.286 --> 28:08.554
but you don't need it.
You're gonna do well.

28:11.323 --> 28:14.660
I cannot believe the Sharks
would not give me a deal.

28:14.660 --> 28:16.295
They are going to regret this.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.096
This is just gonna be
like Ring,

28:18.096 --> 28:20.532
like that doorbell
that none of them invested in.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.734
And it went
That's gonna be me.

28:22.734 --> 28:24.970
I'm gonna be the Ring
of swimsuits.

28:30.576 --> 28:31.410
Your eyes.

28:31.410 --> 28:32.744
Beautiful on the outside,

28:32.744 --> 28:34.079
but if you have diabetes,

28:34.079 --> 28:35.581
there can be some
not-so-pretty stuff

28:35.581 --> 28:37.149
going on inside.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.384
It's true, with diabetic
retinopathy,

28:39.384 --> 28:41.420
excess sugar
can damage blood vessels,

28:41.420 --> 28:43.855
causing vision loss
or even blindness.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.458
NOW is the time to get

28:46.458 --> 28:47.693
your eyes checked.

I'm Amanda.

Sharks, are you ever in
an important meeting

32:30.782 --> 32:33.485
in front
of pretty important people,

32:33.485 --> 32:35.587
and all of a sudden

32:35.587 --> 32:37.122
you get the hiccups?

32:37.122 --> 32:39.324
Hiccups can be really embarrassing.

32:39.324 --> 32:41.193
They can be annoying
and

32:41.193 --> 32:43.328
sometimes even painful.

32:43.328 --> 32:46.598
Amanda, here, try this.
Pinch your nose,

32:46.598 --> 32:49.267
drink this glass of water
all down in one gulp,

32:49.267 --> 32:52.270
and stand on one leg
and balance.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.574
It didn't work.

32:55.574 --> 32:57.909
Um, try this. Uh...

32:57.909 --> 32:59.878
Boo!

32:59.878 --> 33:01.646
Oh, my gosh, Sharks.
I'm so sorry.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.114
I don't know
what's happening.

33:03.114 --> 33:05.851
Guys, allow me, a doctor,
to help.

33:05.851 --> 33:09.054
It's time to say goodbye
to all of these silly tricks

33:09.054 --> 33:10.222
and instead say hello

33:10.222 --> 33:13.758
to HiccAway,
the most effective way

33:13.758 --> 33:15.727
that you can stop
your hiccups.

33:15.727 --> 33:17.762
Amanda, just take this.

33:17.762 --> 33:19.364
Give me
that glass of water.

33:19.364 --> 33:20.832
Just put...

33:20.832 --> 33:22.601
And drink through it.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.270
That easy.

33:25.270 --> 33:27.639
Wow! My hiccups are gone.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.140
- Amazing.
- How does that work?

33:29.140 --> 33:30.208
Shocking how that happens.

33:30.208 --> 33:32.043
You know, hiccups are
a repeated cycle

33:32.043 --> 33:33.745
of spasms
in a diaphragm,

33:33.745 --> 33:36.014
and drinking through
the HiccAway generates

33:36.014 --> 33:39.618
enough pressure that can stop
those spasms in the diaphragm.

33:39.618 --> 33:43.088
It may sound complicated,
but HiccAway does all the work.

33:43.088 --> 33:44.890
Dr. Ali here created it,

33:44.890 --> 33:47.859
the only scientific
hiccup remedy.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.528
Sharks,
who's ready to put an end

33:49.528 --> 33:51.696
to those farfetched
folk remedies

33:51.696 --> 33:55.166
and solve an age-old problem
that affects everyone with...

33:55.166 --> 33:56.868
HiccAway!

33:56.868 --> 33:58.069
Okay, I got a question.

33:58.069 --> 34:00.005
Dr. Ali,
what's the effectiveness rate?

34:00.005 --> 34:03.575
So there is actually a study
that we did a year ago,

34:03.575 --> 34:04.943
and we published in <i>JAMA,</i>

34:04.943 --> 34:06.378
<i>Journal of the
American Medical Association.</i>

34:06.378 --> 34:07.479
Yeah, I actually subscribe
to <i>JAMA.</i>

34:07.479 --> 34:09.481
We show 90% effectiveness.
90% effectiveness.

34:09.481 --> 34:10.782
But, Doc,
I don't understand this,

34:10.782 --> 34:11.950
because I have --

34:11.950 --> 34:13.818
Honestly, I have
a really bad hiccup problem.

34:13.818 --> 34:15.687
It's happened to me
about four times in my life

34:15.687 --> 34:18.990
where I have them for
probably about 12 hours.

34:18.990 --> 34:21.927
I have to even take
muscle relaxers or Valium.
No. Wow.

34:21.927 --> 34:23.194
I just took a sip of this.

34:23.194 --> 34:24.963
It's just like,
I don't understand.

34:24.963 --> 34:27.933
It felt like just
regular water going in.

34:27.933 --> 34:30.001
Sure. I can show you,
how does it work?

34:30.001 --> 34:31.436
Several things
can cause hiccups,

34:31.436 --> 34:33.538
such as acid reflux disease,

34:33.538 --> 34:38.877
carbonated soda, alcoholic
beverage, or spicy food, right?

34:38.877 --> 34:42.714
So any of these can trigger
the diaphragm here.

34:42.714 --> 34:44.583
And then this is spasm.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.651
Then it quick send a message
to the brain

34:46.651 --> 34:48.086
through the phrenic nerve

34:48.086 --> 34:50.822
and then send a quick message
to our throat

34:50.822 --> 34:52.490
and gonna close the valve.

34:52.490 --> 34:56.261
And this is the time you hear
the sound of "hic-cup," right?

34:56.261 --> 35:00.932
And this gonna go again
and again as a vicious cycle.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.601
When you drink
through the HiccAway,

35:02.601 --> 35:05.270
we calculated the length
and the diameter

35:05.270 --> 35:07.639
and the valve here
to reach out

35:07.639 --> 35:10.542
when you drink water through it
to reach a certain pressure.

35:10.542 --> 35:13.745
And this keeps the diaphragm
for, like, let's say,

35:13.745 --> 35:17.749
5 to 10 seconds,
pull it down and keep it there.

35:17.749 --> 35:21.319
So for 5 to 10 seconds,
these two, the diaphragm

35:21.319 --> 35:22.954
and the valve, are closed.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.823
The brain resets the cycle,

35:24.823 --> 35:27.626
so the spasms stop,
and it goes away.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.728
Wow. Interesting.
Dr. Ali, do
you have any testimonials??

35:29.728 --> 35:30.829
Yes.

35:30.829 --> 35:34.265
<i>I have very strange hiccups.</i>

35:34.265 --> 35:36.334
<i>They sound more like burps.</i>

35:36.334 --> 35:38.103
<i>And they're very painful.</i>

35:38.103 --> 35:40.338
Wow.

35:40.338 --> 35:44.576
<i>And the only thing that has
actually worked is this straw.</i>

35:45.810 --> 35:47.612
<i>So I'm gonna drink it now.</i>

35:49.347 --> 35:51.216
Please let it work.

35:55.720 --> 35:56.821
<i>No hiccups.</i>

35:56.821 --> 35:58.323
- Wow.
- That's crazy.

35:58.323 --> 36:01.059
Wow.
So why can't I get a straw...

36:01.059 --> 36:02.827
Right. Mm-hmm.
...and close it down

36:02.827 --> 36:05.430
so it's taking me
a lot more pressure...
Right.

36:05.430 --> 36:07.699
...and I don't need this thing?
Very good question.

36:07.699 --> 36:11.369
You know, the thing is that,
to control that diaphragm,

36:11.369 --> 36:14.305
you need to reach
to a certain pressure.

36:14.305 --> 36:16.508
But you feel free to try --
So I can't emulate this
with a straw?

36:16.508 --> 36:19.177
I've got to get this?
Right.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.513
So, I'm just curious
about your background.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.248
What kind of medical doctor
are you?
Sure. Sure.

36:23.248 --> 36:24.716
I'm a neurointensivist.

36:24.716 --> 36:27.318
Neurointensivist means
the brain ICU doctors.

36:27.318 --> 36:30.555
I work with patients with head
trauma, stroke, brain aneurysm,

36:30.555 --> 36:32.023
bleeding into the head.
Wow.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.025
Anything related
to brain and spine.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.527
Do you own 100%
of the business?

36:35.527 --> 36:38.797
Victor and I,
we have 50%-50% share

36:38.797 --> 36:40.031
of the business of HiccAway.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.300
What happened to Amanda?
She's the best-looking one here.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.269
My niece. Actually
she works with our marketing.

36:44.269 --> 36:46.104
So, yeah.
So I'm the head of marketing,

36:46.104 --> 36:47.405
and I get a commission
on sales.

36:47.405 --> 36:49.641
I didn't put up any money.
I don't have equity.

36:49.641 --> 36:52.777
I'd love to one day,
but I'm very involved in this,

36:52.777 --> 36:55.346
and it seemed --
It is like my baby.

36:55.346 --> 36:57.148
So what
do you sell them for?

36:57.148 --> 36:59.084
Yeah.
We sell them for $14,

36:59.084 --> 37:01.319
and they are wholesale
for $6.

37:01.319 --> 37:02.887
And what does it
cost you to make?

37:02.887 --> 37:05.323
It costs 70 cents.

37:05.323 --> 37:07.358
And where are you
selling them?

37:07.358 --> 37:09.427
Currently on Amazon and our website.

37:09.427 --> 37:12.330
And then we're actually
at a big box retailer in Texas.

37:12.330 --> 37:15.734
We've sold 21,000 units
so far...
Wow.

37:15.734 --> 37:18.002
...which is $300,000
in sales

37:18.002 --> 37:20.805
since we launched
July of last year.

37:20.805 --> 37:22.874
Let me get
the bidding going here

37:22.874 --> 37:26.010
because I'm sure you're gonna
have a lot of interested people.

37:26.010 --> 37:29.581
I'm not gonna be one of them.
I'll tell you why.

37:29.581 --> 37:32.217
I'm one of those moms,
whenever my kid was sick,

37:32.217 --> 37:34.152
I could never find
the thermometer.

37:34.152 --> 37:35.286
I'm just having a problem

37:35.286 --> 37:37.188
thinking that I'm gonna get
my hands on this.

37:37.188 --> 37:39.457
Yeah.
It's gonna be readily there
when I need it.

37:39.457 --> 37:42.060
So I wish you luck,
but I'm out.

37:42.060 --> 37:44.362
Thank you, Barbara,
but let me tell you this.

37:44.362 --> 37:47.432
You know, I was surprised when
I found in <i>Forbes</i> magazine --

37:47.432 --> 37:49.567
Actually,
they published in 2019

37:49.567 --> 37:52.670
that hiccups was
the third most common search

37:52.670 --> 37:54.339
in the whole world.
For health.

37:54.339 --> 37:55.573
And this is --
For the healthcare.

37:55.573 --> 37:56.674
People are looking for it.

37:56.674 --> 37:58.243
But I wonder,
at the point of purchase,

37:58.243 --> 38:01.246
how much skepticism
there would be seeing it there.

38:01.246 --> 38:02.747
I'm not saying
it doesn't have merit.

38:02.747 --> 38:04.182
Clearly, it does.

38:04.182 --> 38:05.884
I'm just thinking
it's a tough sell

38:05.884 --> 38:08.720
to convince people
that it actually is...

38:08.720 --> 38:10.555
I think
it seems intuitive, though.

38:10.555 --> 38:12.757
I mean, I think when people
see something out

38:12.757 --> 38:14.793
on the market like this,
I mean, it is so unique.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.294
I don't think
there's other ones out there.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.629
I haven't done the research.
No.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.063
But I don't think there's
anything else out there like it.

38:19.063 --> 38:20.398
- No, there isn't.
- There is not.

38:20.398 --> 38:22.934
The issue for me
really is need.

38:22.934 --> 38:26.237
I'm just not sure
how many people feel

38:26.237 --> 38:27.505
they need to have it.

38:27.505 --> 38:31.342
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

38:31.342 --> 38:32.844
Guys, look,
I'll save a lot of time.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.112
I love it.

38:34.112 --> 38:35.914
Anything that solves
a medical problem

38:35.914 --> 38:38.550
that really bothers people
in one way or the other

38:38.550 --> 38:40.919
and has the science
to back it up

38:40.919 --> 38:42.987
is a good thing,
right?
Yeah.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.456
It's not something that
you're just gonna blow up

38:45.456 --> 38:49.460
and have 100,000 units sold
in a day, right?

38:49.460 --> 38:51.062
It's a slow burn
and you want it.

38:51.062 --> 38:52.430
It's only been around
how many years?

38:52.430 --> 38:53.531
- One year.
- One year.

38:53.531 --> 38:55.200
One year.
So it's gonna take time

38:55.200 --> 38:56.968
for people to know
that it's there.

38:56.968 --> 38:58.403
But this,
I guarantee you,

38:58.403 --> 39:01.272
this will become part of
everybody's medicine cabinet.

39:01.272 --> 39:02.273
Guarantee it, right?
Yeah.

39:02.273 --> 39:04.042
So I'll make you
an offer, right,

39:04.042 --> 39:05.677
and I just want
a yes or no.

39:05.677 --> 39:08.012
The offer is the $250,000
that you asked for,

39:08.012 --> 39:09.547
for 20%.

39:13.751 --> 39:15.353
I'll do it for 15%.

39:17.722 --> 39:19.123
Good, and now we have
two offers.

39:19.123 --> 39:21.726
Well, no, you're about to have
one offer,

39:21.726 --> 39:22.694
so you've got to tell me
if you want to work with me.

39:22.694 --> 39:23.728
I'll do it for 15%.

39:23.728 --> 39:24.963
Yeah, I'm not going
to wait around,

39:24.963 --> 39:25.964
so you guys can decide.

39:25.964 --> 39:27.665
Sorry, you -- one second.
So you --

39:27.665 --> 39:28.666
Sorry.

39:38.042 --> 39:40.511
Mark, would you do 15%?
No.

39:40.511 --> 39:42.914
No, because I know
where I can get you placed.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.883
You know, I can get you
where you would be seen.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.252
I know if I put my name on it
and get it out there

39:47.252 --> 39:48.453
and said
people should buy it --

39:48.453 --> 39:49.487
All the same for me.

39:49.487 --> 39:51.356
I have products in every
big box retailer.

39:51.356 --> 39:53.791
Yeah, but he's Chef Wonderful
and he's everything else.

39:53.791 --> 39:56.227
Of course.
What about -- Okay.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.929
How about you, Daymond?
Daymond,
what are you doing?

39:57.929 --> 39:58.796
Guys, and I'm not
gonna tell you

39:58.796 --> 40:00.164
I'm gonna be here
waiting.

40:00.164 --> 40:01.466
Yeah, I'm not going
to wait around.

40:01.466 --> 40:03.902
That's okay.
So it's your decision
to make.

40:06.571 --> 40:10.174
18%?
No.

40:10.174 --> 40:13.177
Mark,
you have a deal.
You have a deal!

40:13.177 --> 40:14.112
- Alright.
- Yes.

40:15.446 --> 40:17.081
Crazy.
Well done. Well done.
Thank you. Thank you.

40:17.081 --> 40:18.449
Yes,
absolutely.

40:18.449 --> 40:20.218
That was
horrible negotiating.

40:21.185 --> 40:23.488
I tried! I tried!
You tried. You tried.

40:23.488 --> 40:25.223
We tried.
He's a tough cookie.

40:25.223 --> 40:26.891
Congrats, guys.
Thank you.

40:26.891 --> 40:28.960
Yes! We did it!
Good job, guys.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.229
Good job.
Yay!

40:31.229 --> 40:33.498
Yay, yay, yay.
We got the deal!

40:33.498 --> 40:36.234
I'm so excited that
Mark understood

40:36.234 --> 40:38.069
the vision of HiccAway,
that we wanted

40:38.069 --> 40:41.239
every household to have
a device in their drawer,

40:41.239 --> 40:43.441
and I think that vision
really drew us in there,

40:43.441 --> 40:45.009
and we're really excited
to work with him

40:45.009 --> 40:46.177
to get us there.

40:52.650 --> 40:56.120
Napoleon was born
and raised to conquer.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.690
But he was just kind of
over it, you know.

41:00.191 --> 41:02.160
Watching Prime Video
he realized

41:02.160 --> 41:04.696
he should follow his dreams.

41:04.696 --> 41:08.199
So he ordered a microphone
with Prime next day delivery.

41:08.199 --> 41:10.501
Now the only thing he cared
about conquering

41:10.501 --> 41:11.869
was his audience.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.912
Prime changes everything.

41:38.262 --> 41:40.798
What is...
an overpass?

41:40.798 --> 41:42.400
Come on!

41:42.400 --> 41:44.369
<i>Nobody wants more robot tests.</i>

41:44.369 --> 41:46.070
<i>But we could all use
more ways to save.</i>

41:46.537 --> 41:47.538
Argh!

42:37.055 --> 42:40.892
It's my 5:52 woke-up-like-this
migraine medicine.

42:40.892 --> 42:42.126
It's UBRELVY.

42:42.126 --> 42:44.695
For anytime,
anywhere migraine strikes.

42:44.695 --> 42:47.398
Without worrying if it's
too late or where I am.

42:47.398 --> 42:48.733
One dose can
quickly stop my

42:48.733 --> 42:51.669
migraine in its tracks
within 2 hours.

42:51.669 --> 42:52.937
<i>Unlike older medicines,</i>

42:52.937 --> 42:54.105
<i>UBRELVY is a pill that</i>

42:54.105 --> 42:56.007
<i>directly blocks CGRP protein,</i>

42:56.007 --> 42:57.775
<i>believed to be
a cause of migraine.</i>

42:57.775 --> 43:00.078
<i>Do not take with strong
- CYP3
- A4 inhibitors.</i>

43:00.078 --> 43:01.112
<i>Most common side effects</i>

43:01.112 --> 43:02.447
<i>were nausea and tiredness.</i>

43:02.880 --> 43:05.850
<i>Ask about UBRELVY and learn

Next up is an accessory line

45:07.038 --> 45:09.707
made from
a unique recycled material.

45:17.548 --> 45:18.883
Hi, Sharks.

45:18.883 --> 45:20.718
My name is Tristen Amal

45:20.718 --> 45:22.453
Ikaikamaikai'ikaneokalani
Persons.

45:22.453 --> 45:25.623
I'm from Orem, Utah,
and I'm seeking $250,000

45:25.623 --> 45:27.091
in exchange for 5%
of my business.

45:28.125 --> 45:29.961
Sharks, what if I told you

45:29.961 --> 45:33.397
that I stole a spoon
from my mom's kitchen drawer,

45:33.397 --> 45:36.667
created a ring, and turned it
into money-making madness?

45:36.667 --> 45:38.135
You probably wouldn't
believe me,

45:38.135 --> 45:40.071
but that's exactly
what I've done.

45:40.071 --> 45:41.038
Here's the tea --

45:41.038 --> 45:42.707
I travel all around the world

45:42.707 --> 45:44.942
collecting spoons and
inspiration, and I create

45:44.942 --> 45:48.079
customized collections based
specifically on my experiences.

45:48.079 --> 45:50.248
Through my social media,
I do a drop once a month,

45:50.248 --> 45:52.450
and guess what?

45:52.450 --> 45:53.884
Guess what?
What?

45:53.884 --> 45:56.954
It sells out in minutes.
Mi-nutes.

45:56.954 --> 45:58.823
My drops created
these online frenzies --

45:58.823 --> 46:00.925
and when I say "frenzies,"
I mean I literally

46:00.925 --> 46:03.327
have people camping out
in their work bathrooms,

46:03.327 --> 46:04.629
fighting thumb and thumb

46:04.629 --> 46:06.564
just to try to secure a ring
before it sells out.

46:06.564 --> 46:08.733
Do you realize
how crazy that is?

46:08.733 --> 46:11.969
I just woke up one day and
I was the ring freaking king.

46:11.969 --> 46:14.605
This is because I have utilized
the power of branding,

46:14.605 --> 46:16.741
social media,
and the unique world of Gen Z

46:16.741 --> 46:19.377
to build a fire brand
off of myself.

46:19.377 --> 46:21.245
Sharks, I am such
a branding genius

46:21.245 --> 46:22.747
that I can even take a spoon

46:22.747 --> 46:25.516
that's been
in Mr. Wonderful's mouth...

46:26.784 --> 46:28.019
...and turn it
into a work of art

46:28.019 --> 46:30.154
that any of you Sharks
would be obsessed with.

46:30.154 --> 46:31.389
So, Sharks,

46:31.389 --> 46:33.924
who wants to put a ring on it
and spoon with me?

46:33.924 --> 46:35.459
Let's see 'em.

46:35.459 --> 46:37.495
Sharks, you each have your own
customized press boxes

46:37.495 --> 46:38.696
in front of you.

46:38.696 --> 46:40.798
You're gonna open it
and dump that cup of water

46:40.798 --> 46:43.267
behind the box
with your name on it.

46:43.768 --> 46:45.770
Ahh!

46:45.770 --> 46:48.439
<i>Y Chihuahua, caramba!</i>
Whoa!

46:48.439 --> 46:50.975
Oh, my God.
That is very cool.

46:50.975 --> 46:53.210
Thank you. Open it up.
See what's inside.

46:53.210 --> 46:54.979
Open it up, yeah.
Ahh.
Wow.

46:54.979 --> 46:57.848
Oh, that is beautiful.
Wow.

46:57.848 --> 47:00.551
So this was
a press box I did.
That is nice.

47:00.551 --> 47:02.286
So you're getting
the full experience.
Hey!

47:02.286 --> 47:04.388
Oh,
that's a presentation.

47:04.388 --> 47:06.023
Thank you, guys.
These were all
made from spoons?

47:06.023 --> 47:09.293
So that's where it started,
and then it eventually evolved,

47:09.293 --> 47:10.895
but when I was 12 years old,

47:10.895 --> 47:12.563
I saw a family friend
with a spoon ring,

47:12.563 --> 47:14.532
and I told my dad I thought
it was the coolest thing,

47:14.532 --> 47:16.033
and he took me to the garage.

47:16.033 --> 47:18.102
We literally stole
one of my mom's spoons

47:18.102 --> 47:20.204
and we just beat it into a ring.

47:20.204 --> 47:22.139
Well, I wore
that ring for years.

47:22.139 --> 47:24.942
Fast forward to when I was 17
and my dad had a heart attack.

47:26.344 --> 47:28.145
Um...
Sorry.

47:28.145 --> 47:29.313
I remember
sitting there with him

47:29.313 --> 47:31.349
right before he went into
open heart surgery,

47:31.349 --> 47:34.618
and I just understood
how short life was.

47:34.618 --> 47:37.421
He got through it,
and things were really rough,

47:37.421 --> 47:39.957
and then my mom got diagnosed
with breast cancer.
No.

47:39.957 --> 47:43.561
And in that moment,
I had made a promise to myself

47:43.561 --> 47:45.830
that I was never gonna
be a burden to them.

47:45.830 --> 47:48.366
I was gonna do everything
in my power to take care of them

47:48.366 --> 47:51.502
physically,
emotionally, financially.

47:51.502 --> 47:53.304
So I stole my sister's camera --

47:53.304 --> 47:54.538
so I would use it to make money,

47:54.538 --> 47:56.240
and I had this dream
of traveling the world,

47:56.240 --> 47:57.875
and I would just hustle
and go on a trip

47:57.875 --> 47:59.043
and then be broke again.

47:59.043 --> 48:00.177
And I noticed a comment

48:00.177 --> 48:01.545
on one of my Instagram pictures
that says,

48:01.545 --> 48:03.514
"Does anyone know
where Tristen gets his rings?"

48:03.514 --> 48:05.516
And I was like,
"Okay, maybe I can sell some,

48:05.516 --> 48:06.550
make some for the people
who want them,

48:06.550 --> 48:07.918
and then I'll figure out
my next step."

48:07.918 --> 48:10.621
Now, how long ago was this,
Tristen?
This was in 2017.

48:10.621 --> 48:14.892
So I went to the thrift store,
bought some 25 cent spoons,

48:14.892 --> 48:16.660
threw them on my website,
and that night,

48:16.660 --> 48:18.729
I sold out of 155 rings.

48:18.729 --> 48:19.663
Wow.

48:19.663 --> 48:21.866
And I made $4,000,

48:21.866 --> 48:23.901
and I literally thought
I was ready to retire.

48:23.901 --> 48:25.870
Like, I was coming
for your chair right there.

48:27.037 --> 48:28.572
Eventually, I had to evolve.

48:28.572 --> 48:30.307
Bending thousands
of spoon rings by hand

48:30.307 --> 48:32.076
wasn't a sustainable
business model,

48:32.076 --> 48:34.745
so I really focused
on manufacturing.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.547
I work with
a supply chain company.

48:36.547 --> 48:39.483
I design them start to finish,3 -D CADs, all that.

48:39.483 --> 48:40.785
We send them over.
They're made.

48:40.785 --> 48:42.353
How many followers do
you have on Instagram?

48:42.353 --> 48:44.922
70,000.
And what about
other platforms?

48:44.922 --> 48:46.624
I just started posting
on TikTok.

48:46.624 --> 48:48.092
I have 15,000 there.

48:48.092 --> 48:49.894
Fast forward to today.
Yes.

48:49.894 --> 48:51.595
What are your sales
overall?

48:51.595 --> 48:54.465
So, sales overall
are $2.1 million.

48:54.465 --> 48:55.433
Whoa!
$2.1.

48:55.433 --> 48:56.667
Good for you.

48:56.667 --> 48:59.036
What about
year to date?
Year to date, $575,000.

48:59.036 --> 49:01.272
Okay, so people know --
drops is like,

49:01.272 --> 49:02.573
is a sale
that you have.

49:02.573 --> 49:04.141
Yeah. Yeah.
And it's just
a one-time sale,

49:04.141 --> 49:05.709
and you put out
your collection

49:05.709 --> 49:07.445
or whatever it is
you're dropping...
Yes.

49:07.445 --> 49:09.413
...and when they're gone,
they're gone.
They're gone.
Absolutely.

49:09.413 --> 49:10.648
How often
do you have your drops?

49:10.648 --> 49:12.116
So I have my drops
once a month right now.

49:12.116 --> 49:14.985
Okay, so do you sell outside
of the drops at all?
No.

49:14.985 --> 49:16.720
And what's the average
price of a ring?

49:16.720 --> 49:17.988
$50.

49:17.988 --> 49:20.024
So for your last drop,
how many pieces...
Yeah.

49:20.024 --> 49:22.159
...and what was the total
revenue from those pieces?

49:22.159 --> 49:26.831
So I sold 3,200 units,
and the revenue was $155,000.

49:26.831 --> 49:28.766
Wow.
Tristen,
when you do a drop,

49:28.766 --> 49:30.634
how quickly do
your rings sell out?

49:30.634 --> 49:33.003
This last one was just about
24 hours.

49:33.003 --> 49:35.306
I've had some that
are like 20 minutes.

49:35.306 --> 49:37.274
Tristen, you're unique.
I get it.

49:37.274 --> 49:39.210
You're a one-man band.

49:39.210 --> 49:43.013
I give you a $250,000, and then
you get run over by a bus.

49:43.013 --> 49:44.515
How's that gonna work out?

49:44.515 --> 49:47.751
So, you'd be out of money,
and I'd be so sorry for you.

49:47.751 --> 49:50.754
But...

49:50.754 --> 49:53.090
Infrastructure.
The most honest answer
we've ever heard in the Tank.

49:54.258 --> 49:55.993
I mean, that is a problem
here, right?

49:55.993 --> 49:58.295
Yeah. So right now,
it's a very lean team.

49:58.295 --> 49:59.964
I'm really proud of myself
for how far

49:59.964 --> 50:01.131
I've been able
to take things.

50:01.131 --> 50:02.166
I'm very resourceful.

50:02.166 --> 50:04.134
So I think from
watching this show --

50:04.134 --> 50:05.936
literally from when
I was 10 years old --

50:05.936 --> 50:08.572
I think instilled in me
to believe in myself.

50:08.572 --> 50:10.374
No matter the cards
you are dealt,

50:10.374 --> 50:11.842
you're allowed
to work hard.

50:11.842 --> 50:14.178
So the challenge, Tristen,
is how do you grow?

50:14.178 --> 50:15.212
Yeah.
Right?

50:15.212 --> 50:16.614
Because if you do
too many drops,

50:16.614 --> 50:18.549
it kind of defeats the whole
purpose of doing a drop.
Yeah.

50:18.549 --> 50:20.518
Is it new lines?
Is it new brands?

50:20.518 --> 50:21.619
How do you
scale this?

50:21.619 --> 50:23.120
One would be
a core collection

50:23.120 --> 50:25.222
that is a good introduction
to the brand.

50:25.222 --> 50:27.291
It doesn't take away from drops,
because I've worked so hard

50:27.291 --> 50:29.560
to build that hype and I want
to be careful with it.

50:29.560 --> 50:30.995
But I'm leaving money
on the table

50:30.995 --> 50:32.763
when people come to my site
and there's nothing to buy.

50:32.763 --> 50:35.432
Tristen, how old were you
when you started the business?

50:35.432 --> 50:37.468
And how old
are you now?
I was 19.

50:37.468 --> 50:39.803
I was fresh out of high school,
and now I'm 22.

50:39.803 --> 50:42.806
I think that you have
a very cool model here,

50:42.806 --> 50:45.643
and this is
a great business for you,

50:45.643 --> 50:48.345
but I don't think
it's investable for me.

50:48.345 --> 50:51.115
I'm sorry, I'm out.

50:51.115 --> 50:52.583
You know,
I continue to evolve.

50:52.583 --> 50:55.519
I really want to take
this business as far as I can

50:55.519 --> 50:57.187
and reach
the full potential with it.

50:57.187 --> 51:01.258
It's obvious that this is a very
emotional business for you.

51:01.258 --> 51:03.661
Absolutely.
For me to
give you an offer,

51:03.661 --> 51:07.131
it would take a sufficient
amount of your company,

51:07.131 --> 51:09.233
the proper valuation,

51:09.233 --> 51:10.434
and then I'm gonna
break your heart.

51:10.434 --> 51:12.369
Well, I'm here to talk.

51:12.369 --> 51:13.771
Listen, we've all been here
long enough,

51:13.771 --> 51:15.906
and I know
the proper valuation,

51:15.906 --> 51:17.074
so I'm not going
to insult you.

51:17.074 --> 51:18.642
I'm out.
Okay.

51:18.642 --> 51:22.346
Last year,
I did $720,000 in sales,

51:22.346 --> 51:24.848
and I netted close
to 60% of that,

51:24.848 --> 51:26.216
like $440,000.

51:26.216 --> 51:28.118
So I understand that scale,
that margin won't stay the same.

51:28.118 --> 51:29.186
For me, it's also about --

51:29.186 --> 51:30.788
I mean, you solved
your original problem,

51:30.788 --> 51:31.956
worried about
being broke.

51:31.956 --> 51:34.124
I mean, I look at this
as a really unique deal.

51:34.124 --> 51:36.493
I mean, you're it.
There's nobody else.

51:36.493 --> 51:38.028
I'm really intrigued.

51:38.028 --> 51:39.663
So I'm gonna
make you an offer.
Okay.

51:39.663 --> 51:42.733
But it reflects the risk
inherent in this deal.

51:42.733 --> 51:44.835
Yeah.
I have a lot more
followers than you do.

51:44.835 --> 51:47.237
Maybe some percentage of them,
I can turn into buyers.

51:47.237 --> 51:48.572
I don't know how many.
Yeah.

51:48.572 --> 51:50.774
Because I can tell, you guys
both hit the same demographic.

51:50.774 --> 51:52.343
Yeah, definitely. Definitely.
Absolutely.

51:52.343 --> 51:56.380
I'm gonna give you the $250,000.
It has some terms to it.

51:56.380 --> 51:59.016
I want to be your partner.
It's 50/50. I want 50%.

52:00.384 --> 52:02.419
Wait a second. Silence.
I don't need the noise.

52:02.419 --> 52:03.621
Oh, my Lord.

52:03.621 --> 52:05.889
You're gonna have to buy
keyman insurance

52:05.889 --> 52:07.524
in case the bus
does you in,

52:07.524 --> 52:09.293
because I am worried
about that.
Okay.

52:09.293 --> 52:11.228
And then I'm gonna work
with you to blow this up.

52:11.228 --> 52:13.764
I have a lot of people I can
work with to make that happen.

52:13.764 --> 52:17.801
I've got so many businesses that
are synergistic to what you do.

52:17.801 --> 52:20.004
And he's gonna take insurance
out on you as well,

52:20.004 --> 52:21.572
which --
that worries me, too.

52:21.572 --> 52:23.807
Why is that good for me,
for you to get run over?

52:23.807 --> 52:25.843
Obviously, you are
the whole business.

52:25.843 --> 52:27.978
Not <i>some</i> of it.
You're 100%.

52:27.978 --> 52:29.413
Yeah.
Okay?

52:29.413 --> 52:32.282
I love that offer.
Very creative.
Of course you do.

52:32.282 --> 52:33.617
But Tristen,
you know,

52:33.617 --> 52:35.719
fashion's
a very talent-driven business.
Mm-hmm.

52:35.719 --> 52:37.721
You've got to have the talent,
the eye, the feel

52:37.721 --> 52:40.024
on both the product side
and the marketing side.

52:40.024 --> 52:42.926
Right? And to Lori's point,
is a great business for <i>you,</i>

52:42.926 --> 52:46.296
but you haven't really been able
to communicate what's next.

52:46.296 --> 52:47.297
What can you do
to make this

52:47.297 --> 52:49.366
a $5 million or $10 million
business?

52:49.366 --> 52:51.402
Because it's not just having
more drops and more rings.

52:51.402 --> 52:54.438
So this year, I'm projecting
$1.6 million on just the drops.

52:54.438 --> 52:55.706
Where the scaling
will come from,

52:55.706 --> 52:58.776
I think, is the core
collection of rings,

52:58.776 --> 53:01.278
and then I really want to
break into other categories,

53:01.278 --> 53:02.713
and that category expansion

53:02.713 --> 53:04.682
will just make the brand
bigger and wider.

53:04.682 --> 53:07.951
And...
Well, are you ready to give
somebody 50% for that?

53:07.951 --> 53:09.319
I am not. Not 50%.

53:09.319 --> 53:10.688
Well, but think of
the value I bring.

53:10.688 --> 53:12.690
Here you are on "Shark Tank,"
right in front of Mr. Wonderful,

53:12.690 --> 53:14.892
who gave you
a fantastic offer.

53:14.892 --> 53:16.760
50% is too much.

53:16.760 --> 53:18.095
Counter.
Well, you can counter.

53:18.095 --> 53:19.263
Would you be willing to go...

53:20.464 --> 53:23.167
I have an offer
for you.

53:23.167 --> 53:25.135
Okay.

53:31.008 --> 53:33.210
How did Olay top Expensive
creams?

53:33.210 --> 53:35.179
By staying on top of our game

53:35.179 --> 53:37.848
With derm-recommended
ingredients in every jar

53:37.848 --> 53:40.784
Olay Regenerist with Niacinamide
has hydration

53:40.784 --> 53:45.222
THAT beats the 100, 200, even
$400 cream

53:45.222 --> 53:49.460
For smooth skin, try Retinol24

53:49.460 --> 53:53.197
For visibly firm skin, get
Collagen Peptide

53:53.197 --> 53:57.034
- For 2
- X brighter skin, get new Vitamin C

53:57.034 --> 53:58.302
Can’t top this skin

53:58.302 --> 54:00.237
Shop now at Olay.com

54:01.705 --> 54:05.843
For me, one of the best things
about life is that

54:05.843 --> 54:07.845
we keep moving forward.

54:08.679 --> 54:11.014
We discover exciting new
technologies.

54:13.083 --> 54:17.287
Redefine who we are and how we
want to lead our lives.

54:17.287 --> 54:20.624
Basically, choose what we want
our future to look like.

54:21.625 --> 54:23.627
So what's yours going to be?

54:30.901 --> 54:32.269
<i>People today...</i>

54:32.269 --> 54:34.538
<i>they could spend
half their lives over 50.</i>

54:34.538 --> 54:36.073
<i>But it's gonna to take
some planning.</i>

54:36.073 --> 54:38.509
What can you do for me?

54:38.509 --> 54:41.578
<i>Make sure your money lives
as long as you do.</i>

54:41.578 --> 54:42.780
<i>The younger you are,</i>

54:42.780 --> 54:44.615
<i>the more you need AARP.</i>

54:44.615 --> 54:45.449
<i>Join today.</i>

54:46.250 --> 54:48.085
Aha, looks like you’re in the

54:48.085 --> 54:50.587
‘dancing to the beat of my
own drum’ stage, baby.

54:50.587 --> 54:51.421
We’re Huggies.

54:51.421 --> 54:52.990
We got just what you need.

54:52.990 --> 54:55.392
And we’ll keep you comfy
through all your moves.

54:55.392 --> 54:58.395
That’s it kid, dance like
nobody’s watching.

54:58.395 --> 55:00.397
Huggies, we got you, baby.

55:00.898 --> 55:03.801
You booked a sunny
Vrbo ski chalet.

55:03.801 --> 55:06.203
With endless views
of snow-covered peaks.

55:06.203 --> 55:08.138
But the thing
they’ll remember forever?

55:08.138 --> 55:09.807
Grandpa coming out
of retirement

55:09.807 --> 55:11.575
to give a few ski lessons.

55:11.575 --> 55:14.278
The time to plan
your get together is now.

55:14.278 --> 55:15.512
Find it on Vrbo.

55:15.879 --> 55:18.248
Ready to shine
from the inside out?

55:18.248 --> 55:21.385
Try Nature's Bounty
Hair, Skin and Nails Gummies.

55:21.385 --> 55:22.853
The number one brand

55:22.853 --> 55:24.354
to support beautiful hair,

55:24.354 --> 55:25.622
glowing skin,

55:25.622 --> 55:27.391
and healthy nails.

55:27.391 --> 55:28.625
Try jelly bean vitamins

55:28.625 --> 55:30.561
with two times the biotin.

55:31.195 --> 55:34.198
I would consider us a
collective of designers.

55:34.198 --> 55:36.266
Being able to work
anywhere is important,

55:36.266 --> 55:37.501
especially now.

55:37.501 --> 55:39.870
With Windows 11, we all do
different things.

55:39.870 --> 55:41.238
Nils is doing illustration.

55:41.238 --> 55:42.372
What’s awesome

55:42.372 --> 55:44.374
is to be able to combine the
fingers and the pen.

55:44.374 --> 55:45.876
Ferdy is doing editing.

55:45.876 --> 55:48.579
It’s so much faster for
me to render these clips.

55:48.579 --> 55:50.314
Carlos is doing
animations.

55:50.314 --> 55:52.850
You have the snap tools,
and it’s so responsive.

55:52.850 --> 55:53.851
We’ve been working
together

55:53.851 --> 55:55.819
from pretty much everywhere.

55:55.819 --> 55:58.655
With Windows 11, we're
just doing it better.

56:00.958 --> 56:03.126
As a DJ, I know all
about customization.

56:03.126 --> 56:04.728
That’s why I love
Liberty Mutual.

56:04.728 --> 56:06.129
They customize
my car insurance,

56:06.129 --> 56:07.497
so I only pay
for what I need.

56:07.497 --> 56:08.498
How about a throwback?

56:08.498 --> 56:11.301
<i>♪ Liberty, Liberty,
Liberty, Liberty ♪</i>

56:11.301 --> 56:12.736
<i>Only pay for what you need.</i>

56:12.736 --> 56:15.505
<i>♪ Liberty, Liberty,
Liberty, Liberty ♪</i>

57:25.876 --> 57:27.778
Two Sharks are out.

57:27.778 --> 57:29.880
Tristen has an offer
on the table from Kevin

57:29.880 --> 57:33.951
for 50% of his spoon ring
company, Tristen Ikaika.

57:33.951 --> 57:36.320
But Barbara is also interested.

57:36.320 --> 57:40.791
I'll give you the $250,000
for only 20%.

57:40.791 --> 57:43.126
I'll do it for 15%.
Oh,
what a creepy guy.

57:43.126 --> 57:43.927
Whoa!

57:43.927 --> 57:45.062
- Ooh.
- Wow.

57:45.062 --> 57:46.163
Wow, Kevin!

57:46.163 --> 57:48.198
You came down 35%?

57:48.198 --> 57:49.232
Why did
you do that?

57:49.232 --> 57:51.068
I just feel
a real connection here.

57:51.068 --> 57:53.637
Suddenly,
a connection.
You know the old style of,
in the Renaissance period,

57:53.637 --> 57:55.939
you remember the patron
and the young artist?

57:55.939 --> 57:57.207
That's how
I feel about it.

57:57.207 --> 57:59.009
Now you're in
a funding frenzy.

57:59.009 --> 58:00.610
Okay. Um...

58:00.610 --> 58:01.912
Okay, so....

58:01.912 --> 58:03.981
You got two Sharks
wrapped around your finger.

58:03.981 --> 58:05.515
Yeah, and, Tristen,
I'll simplify it.

58:05.515 --> 58:07.417
I just don't see
your path to scale.

58:07.417 --> 58:09.019
In order for me
to get involved,

58:09.019 --> 58:12.356
I've got to see a path to
$5 million, $10 million,
$15 million in sales.

58:12.356 --> 58:15.092
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

58:15.092 --> 58:16.793
Okay. Um...

58:16.793 --> 58:19.196
$250,000 for --
you're at 20%?

58:19.196 --> 58:21.698
Yes, I am.
And you're at 15%.

58:21.698 --> 58:23.300
Okay, um...

58:23.300 --> 58:25.168
This definitely is...

58:25.168 --> 58:29.006
You know what, Kevin is willing
to take a deal 5% under

58:29.006 --> 58:30.707
just to undercut me
because he's a bastard,

58:30.707 --> 58:32.776
That's the way rolls.
No, he's not.
He's Mr. Wonderful.

58:32.776 --> 58:33.977
Yes. Kevin, you do it
all the time.

58:33.977 --> 58:35.212
There's nothing
wonderful about you.

58:35.212 --> 58:37.280
That's why that name
is so preposterous.

58:37.280 --> 58:39.483
He's not the cool
you want to be.

58:39.483 --> 58:42.019
He's an animal.
He's after the buck.

58:42.019 --> 58:44.955
It's very bad when you have
to talk down your competitor.
That's exactly
what he focuses on.

58:44.955 --> 58:47.557
I never do that with Barbara.
I celebrate her.

58:47.557 --> 58:48.692
You just undercut
your competitor.

58:48.692 --> 58:49.726
And you should
know something.

58:49.726 --> 58:50.894
The only reason
she's here today is

58:50.894 --> 58:53.196
I bought her a new broom.

58:53.196 --> 58:54.698
I'll tell you where
I'll stick that broom.

58:58.301 --> 59:00.070
Listen, I don't know
why you'd give up 20%

59:00.070 --> 59:01.338
when you can do a deal for 15%.

59:01.338 --> 59:02.305
That makes no sense.

59:02.305 --> 59:04.941
Okay. Um...

59:04.941 --> 59:06.777
The 5% is not going
to change your life.

59:06.777 --> 59:07.811
It really will not.
You're right.

59:07.811 --> 59:08.979
Very expensive,
long-term.

59:08.979 --> 59:10.147
If you're
a $20 million company,

59:10.147 --> 59:12.816
5%, you won't
even know you gave it.

59:12.816 --> 59:15.352
Yeah. Um...

59:17.821 --> 59:19.389
What do you want to do,
Tristen?

59:19.389 --> 59:21.992
Okay. Um...

59:23.293 --> 59:24.961
Um...

59:28.632 --> 59:29.566
Kevin, you have a deal.

59:29.566 --> 59:30.967
- Oh!
- Aw!

59:30.967 --> 59:31.968
Yes, sir!
Congratulations.

59:31.968 --> 59:33.537
It's like
sleeping with a dragon.

59:33.537 --> 59:34.838
- No.
- Oh!

59:34.838 --> 59:36.606
I can't wait to
work with you, man.
Thank you.

59:36.606 --> 59:39.009
I'm really excited.
Thank you so much.
That's fantastic.
Really interested.

59:39.009 --> 59:40.343
Go call your dad.

59:40.343 --> 59:41.812
Good luck, guys.
Thanks for the rings.
Congrats.

59:41.812 --> 59:43.613
Thank you.
I like that guy.

59:43.613 --> 59:46.583
Oh, what just happened?

59:46.583 --> 59:48.618
Holy crap.

59:48.618 --> 59:50.187
Oh, I feel like I'm in a dream.

59:50.187 --> 59:53.056
Oh! Wow.

59:53.056 --> 59:54.391
At the end of the day,
the deal with Kevin

59:54.391 --> 59:57.694
was the right deal for me
because it was less equity,

59:57.694 --> 59:59.763
and I'm really protective
of everything that I've built,

59:59.763 --> 1:00:01.098
but I'm really excited
to just take things

1:00:01.098 --> 1:00:02.232
to the next level with him.

1:00:02.232 --> 1:00:04.234
I know he is amazing
at what he does

1:00:04.234 --> 1:00:05.802
and we'll just be unstoppable.

1:00:05.802 --> 1:00:07.771
I'm shocked. Did you think
he was gonna take my offer?

1:00:07.771 --> 1:00:08.939
I can't believe it.
He did a deal
with somebody

1:00:08.939 --> 1:00:10.740
who would take him off
of life support

1:00:10.740 --> 1:00:12.075
to charge their cellphone.

1:00:12.075 --> 1:00:13.777
Oh, come on.
It's horrible.

1:00:13.777 --> 1:00:16.780
You just wanted to win.
You went from 50% to 15%.
From 50% to 15%.

1:00:16.780 --> 1:00:19.015
This was because you
wanted to beat me out.
Don't be
a sore loser.

1:00:19.015 --> 1:00:20.484
That's all.
There was no love there.

1:00:20.484 --> 1:00:22.152
50% to 15%?
Come on.
Barbara, don't be
a sore loser.

1:00:22.152 --> 1:00:23.153
I'll send you a ring.
