Left 2 and right 3
into left 1 straight 150.

01:10.584 --> 01:14.001
Cut to left 3
into left 5 and back, up and 80.

01:14.376 --> 01:15.626
Watch out, left 5 and back.

01:15.917 --> 01:19.709
Right 6 and left 2 full gear,
release for 50 then right 6.

01:20.084 --> 01:22.458
Invisible, cut to
left 2 and cut to right 3

01:22.459 --> 01:24.792
into U-turn 200 left 7.

01:25.042 --> 01:27.458
Watch out for the dangerous post-slope

01:27.459 --> 01:30.542
left 4 and right 4, straight 100 meter

01:30.626 --> 01:31.875
This is the dangerous post-slope

01:31.876 --> 01:34.584
left 4 then right 4,
straight 100 meter.

01:36.167 --> 01:36.751
ladies and gentlemen

01:36.752 --> 01:39.208
This is the final stage of the

01:39.209 --> 01:40.792
2022 China Rally Championship.

01:40.959 --> 01:43.125
Xu Tailang has taken

01:43.126 --> 01:45.251
a commanding lead!

01:45.501 --> 01:47.833
Last year, Lang won the first stage

01:47.834 --> 01:49.751
as a low-ranked driver.

01:50.001 --> 01:51.541
Who could have predicted
this eye-popping performance

01:51.542 --> 01:53.209
after he transferred teams?

01:53.501 --> 01:54.084
Lang!

01:54.334 --> 01:57.126
He has taken the rally world by storm!

02:11.001 --> 02:12.209
Oil temperature?

02:12.292 --> 02:13.959
Oil, 100 normal.

02:15.417 --> 02:16.542
3.5 bar turbo boost,

02:16.667 --> 02:18.542
push the Anti-Lag to the max.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.876
I'd first like to thank
my crew and sponsors.

04:07.542 --> 04:09.209
I'd also like to thank my co-driver,

04:09.501 --> 04:11.001
who's always got my back!

04:11.084 --> 04:11.459
C'mon,

04:11.501 --> 04:13.001
let's get a shot of him!

04:16.875 --> 04:18.791
Finally, I want to thank

04:18.959 --> 04:21.416
the most important person in my life.

04:21.666 --> 04:23.209
I know he's here, somewhere.

04:23.251 --> 04:24.667
I want to tell him...

04:27.084 --> 04:28.001
Dad...

04:28.834 --> 04:29.917
Thank you.

04:31.751 --> 04:33.209
Thank you...

04:34.042 --> 04:36.042
For being ever so supportive.

04:36.626 --> 04:37.876
Thank you...

04:38.626 --> 04:40.626
For discouraging my dreams.

04:41.167 --> 04:44.417
And thank you for disrespecting my career.

04:45.834 --> 04:48.001
I invited you here today

04:48.334 --> 04:50.251
to prove you were wrong.

04:50.917 --> 04:53.417
I'm the champion.

04:53.751 --> 04:55.126
I've made it.

04:57.251 --> 04:59.001
Interesting words for your father.

04:59.042 --> 05:00.001
What about your mother?

05:00.042 --> 05:01.667
I never met her.

05:03.209 --> 05:04.709
She died after my birth.

05:05.251 --> 05:06.584
I'm sorry.

05:07.917 --> 05:08.709
Alright.

05:08.751 --> 05:10.376
Thank you, that's all.

05:12.876 --> 05:20.542
Lang!

05:30.959 --> 05:32.209
Congratulations.

05:33.209 --> 05:36.001
You didn't have to dress up.

05:41.792 --> 05:43.459
When you first learned to drive,

05:43.584 --> 05:45.959
I never thought you'd turn out this good.

05:48.251 --> 05:50.876
You always forced me to do stuff I hated.

05:51.709 --> 05:53.084
First, math.

05:53.209 --> 05:54.959
Then medicine.

05:55.876 --> 05:57.876
And when I told you I loved driving,

05:58.001 --> 06:00.251
You made me an ambulance driver.

06:01.126 --> 06:02.542
Before she died, your mother said

06:02.959 --> 06:05.834
It'd be great if you could become a doctor.

06:05.876 --> 06:07.542
Did she also say it'd be great

06:07.626 --> 06:09.626
if her husband got into some fucked up shit

06:09.709 --> 06:11.292
and got locked up for six years

06:11.417 --> 06:14.209
right before she gave birth?

06:17.709 --> 06:18.417
Follow me.

06:47.209 --> 06:48.417
Slow down, Lang...

06:48.459 --> 06:49.126
Not too fast...

06:49.167 --> 06:50.001
Careful...

07:04.292 --> 07:05.667
I'm gonna be sick.

07:05.834 --> 07:06.917
Go ahead.

07:07.084 --> 07:08.626
That's my co-driver's anyways.

07:36.084 --> 07:37.001
There was someone else in the car!

07:37.002 --> 07:39.334
They say right before you die...

07:41.667 --> 07:44.917
your whole life flashes in front of you.

07:46.459 --> 07:48.292
Let's see.

07:59.334 --> 08:01.251
"Have a sip, son."

08:07.417 --> 08:10.876
"What are these good for?"

08:19.292 --> 08:21.584
"Is this your signature?"

08:27.542 --> 08:28.834
"Boy, what you looking at?"

08:32.833 --> 08:35.251
"Mom..."

08:39.501 --> 08:41.126
"Lang, I love you."

08:43.501 --> 08:45.334
"Sorry..."

08:47.834 --> 08:50.292
"I found someone else."

09:00.542 --> 09:03.251
"How do you feel?"

09:07.584 --> 09:09.667
"It's my first time. Pretty nervous."

09:15.792 --> 09:17.292
"Fucking idiot! You crashed
on a straightaway!"

09:17.876 --> 09:20.084
"I quit!"

09:22.751 --> 09:24.167
"That was your last chance!"

09:27.334 --> 09:29.292
"Get out!"

09:31.334 --> 09:34.126
"I got you a job driving an ambulance."

09:40.959 --> 09:42.376
"Emergency Medical Dispatch speaking."

09:42.417 --> 09:43.667
"We need an ambulance."

09:48.376 --> 09:50.126
"Didn't take you long to fuck that up!"

09:52.459 --> 09:54.417
"Cheer up..."

09:59.501 --> 10:00.959
"Oops..."

10:06.584 --> 10:08.542
"Stop drinking,
and you can drive for my boss."

10:14.584 --> 10:15.751
"Drive!"

10:24.334 --> 10:26.501
"You drive well!"

10:28.209 --> 10:31.709
"This rally car's yours."

10:46.292 --> 10:48.501
"Steady, almost there!"

11:00.626 --> 11:02.834
"Mom, this is for you."

13:29.542 --> 13:30.834
Mrs. Chen?

13:34.917 --> 13:37.001
I'm sorry, do I know you?

13:37.167 --> 13:38.542
I was Class of 2004.

13:38.584 --> 13:39.459
Xu Tailang.

13:39.542 --> 13:40.959
You were my teacher.

13:41.084 --> 13:42.626
You used to tell me.

13:42.751 --> 13:43.792
Tailang, oh Tailang...

13:43.834 --> 13:45.542
Don't be so headstrong...

13:45.709 --> 13:47.126
Class of 2004?

13:47.209 --> 13:48.709
It's 1998.

13:48.959 --> 13:50.042
Weirdo...

13:53.542 --> 13:54.667
1998?

13:55.209 --> 13:56.501
1998...

13:56.626 --> 13:57.626
Really?

13:58.001 --> 13:59.959
Thief!

14:23.334 --> 14:24.126
I'm already dead.

14:24.167 --> 14:25.584
Why should I be afraid?

14:42.376 --> 14:43.751
Fucking Batman?

15:05.876 --> 15:07.126
Isn't that a little unfair?

15:17.001 --> 15:17.584
Don't get excited.

15:30.792 --> 15:31.501
Take off my belt!

15:31.876 --> 15:32.959
My belt!

15:33.459 --> 15:34.376
Quickly!

15:37.501 --> 15:38.501
Tie him up!

15:50.584 --> 15:51.417
Dad?

15:52.667 --> 15:53.376
Dad?

15:55.084 --> 15:55.959
Police!

15:57.751 --> 15:58.709
What are you doing?

15:59.167 --> 15:59.917
Brother

16:00.501 --> 16:01.417
We'll meet again.

16:04.751 --> 16:05.834
Stop!

16:15.334 --> 16:17.376
It's been hours,

16:17.959 --> 16:20.626
and you still haven't told
me where you're from.

16:22.792 --> 16:24.751
I already did!

16:24.876 --> 16:26.167
You just don't get it.

16:26.209 --> 16:27.376
This is your ID?

16:27.417 --> 16:28.959
Yea, obviously.

16:31.959 --> 16:33.376
This is a fucking ID.

16:33.501 --> 16:35.001
See?

16:38.126 --> 16:39.792
What year were you born?

16:40.084 --> 16:41.251
I...

16:44.042 --> 16:44.792
Next year.

16:47.709 --> 16:49.459
You think because you
helped us catch a bad guy

16:49.501 --> 16:51.834
We're all close and shit now.

16:53.042 --> 16:54.876
You may have the right to remain silent,

16:54.959 --> 16:57.459
but you don't have the right
to bullshit me, got it?

16:58.417 --> 16:59.292
Where the hell are you from?

16:59.376 --> 17:01.251
I told you, from here!

17:01.626 --> 17:02.917
Take me to where you live.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.376
If no one can vouch for you,

17:05.584 --> 17:07.251
I'll send you straight to the nut house.

17:09.834 --> 17:13.251
I can't make 24 with these cards...

17:16.666 --> 17:18.001
I can't do it.

17:22.376 --> 17:23.791
Boss, you keep losing.

17:40.292 --> 17:42.626
You don't have to kill yourself
just because you can't do the math!

17:45.667 --> 17:46.376
Sir...

17:46.834 --> 17:48.084
What's up with the diver?

17:48.792 --> 17:49.792
You know him.

17:49.834 --> 17:50.792
That's Liu Yi.

17:50.834 --> 17:52.292
He and his pops are street vendors.

17:52.792 --> 17:55.001
They're terrified of the cops.

17:55.126 --> 17:56.084
Wu Yi's son?

17:56.167 --> 17:57.001
Yeah.

17:57.334 --> 17:58.126
He shot up quickly.

17:58.251 --> 17:59.251
Yeah.

18:00.376 --> 18:01.209
And who are you?

18:02.376 --> 18:03.501
Officer, my name is Ma.

18:03.584 --> 18:05.959
Zheng's been looking after me.

18:06.667 --> 18:07.667
What do you do?

18:07.834 --> 18:09.626
Programming and software development.

18:10.417 --> 18:11.917
So, unemployed.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.251
Get out of here.

18:18.751 --> 18:19.709
Do you know this man?

18:20.251 --> 18:21.334
How are you two related?

18:26.001 --> 18:27.042
Big brother!

18:29.584 --> 18:30.792
Sir...

18:31.001 --> 18:32.126
Don't "Sir" me.

18:32.292 --> 18:33.708
Just 'cause you've got a video hall

18:33.709 --> 18:34.584
with some Hong Kong movies...

18:34.959 --> 18:36.459
This is our Chief...

18:36.542 --> 18:37.167
Call him Chief.

18:37.376 --> 18:38.042
Chief...

18:38.167 --> 18:38.917
Show some respect.

18:38.959 --> 18:39.709
Save it.

18:39.876 --> 18:41.376
Who is he?

18:43.542 --> 18:44.084
Brother...

18:44.584 --> 18:45.251
Yeah?

18:45.626 --> 18:47.792
It's the anniversary of dad's death.
Where've you been?

18:48.459 --> 18:50.626
Get in there and pay your respects to him!

18:51.459 --> 18:52.084
Yes, yes.

18:52.209 --> 18:53.709
Hold on, hold on!

18:53.792 --> 18:55.167
Keep your mouth shut.

18:56.917 --> 18:58.959
What's your father's name?

19:01.001 --> 19:03.042
Shit, Gramps died when I was little.
I don't remember his name.

19:04.167 --> 19:05.709
What are you mumbling about?

19:07.167 --> 19:07.792
Sir...

19:08.292 --> 19:09.834
My brother Zheng...

19:10.792 --> 19:12.417
He was always my dad's favorite.

19:12.709 --> 19:13.792
He never really liked me,

19:14.126 --> 19:16.209
so I left home early to make it on my own.

19:16.542 --> 19:18.084
To be honest,

19:19.376 --> 19:21.292
his death never really felt like a loss,

19:21.501 --> 19:24.084
because he never loved me.

19:24.376 --> 19:25.417
It's true.

19:25.709 --> 19:28.376
Go inside and check if
you don't believe me.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.709
He's wearing a checkered
shirt in his portrait.

19:31.542 --> 19:33.542
His ashes are next to the TV in a red urn.

19:33.584 --> 19:35.209
The TV is covered by a white cloth.

19:35.251 --> 19:36.542
Go and see for yourself.

19:37.834 --> 19:40.709
Fine, wait here.

19:45.584 --> 19:47.251
How do you know my name?

19:47.417 --> 19:48.584
It's written on your forehead.

19:51.459 --> 19:53.209
What are you scheming about?

19:53.334 --> 19:54.542
Come here.

19:55.126 --> 19:56.417
Tell me,

19:56.751 --> 19:59.334
what brand is your TV?

20:03.959 --> 20:05.042
Hitachi...

20:05.501 --> 20:09.084
Or is it Toshiba?

20:11.584 --> 20:13.251
What's the brand?

20:13.667 --> 20:14.292
Hitachi!

20:14.376 --> 20:16.292
Everything else checks out.

20:18.501 --> 20:19.376
You're a lousy son.

20:22.042 --> 20:23.167
Take care, Chief Jin!

20:23.251 --> 20:24.251
Take care, Chief Jin!

20:29.126 --> 20:30.292
Come with me.

20:45.667 --> 20:47.292
When did you sneak into my house?

20:48.167 --> 20:49.334
You know it so well.

20:49.959 --> 20:50.792
I...

20:52.001 --> 20:53.167
Buddy,

20:54.042 --> 20:55.626
Quit stealing.

21:00.709 --> 21:01.334
Okay.

21:01.917 --> 21:02.792
What's your name?

21:03.167 --> 21:04.251
Xu Tailang.

21:04.334 --> 21:05.417
But you can just call me Lang.

21:06.001 --> 21:07.167
What was your dad thinking,

21:07.584 --> 21:09.084
giving you such a stupid name?

21:09.334 --> 21:10.292
Tailang?

21:10.501 --> 21:11.334
Tailang...

21:12.542 --> 21:14.084
Your dad's an idiot.

21:19.959 --> 21:20.959
You know, given his IQ,

21:20.960 --> 21:22.876
to produce a son this awesome...

21:24.042 --> 21:26.001
My mother must've been pretty smart.

21:28.667 --> 21:30.251
I can meet my mom...

21:31.667 --> 21:33.334
I can meet my mom!

21:34.584 --> 21:35.709
Hey, are you married?

21:36.001 --> 21:36.959
What's her name?

21:38.376 --> 21:40.792
You haven't even asked my name
and you want hers...

21:41.042 --> 21:42.501
What are you after?

21:42.626 --> 21:44.001
So used to stealing,

21:44.126 --> 21:45.626
you wanna steal her too?

21:45.650 --> 21:46.875
Aah..yah...

21:46.876 --> 21:47.251
My bad...

21:47.334 --> 21:48.334
Okay Zheng,

21:48.501 --> 21:49.792
What's your full name?

21:51.251 --> 21:51.751
It's funny.

21:52.376 --> 21:53.084
We have the same surname.

21:54.417 --> 21:55.084
Xu Zhengtai.

21:56.542 --> 21:57.709
Not bad, huh?

21:57.917 --> 21:58.959
My dad was smart, right?

21:59.001 --> 22:00.876
Gave me a great name.

22:01.584 --> 22:04.584
That's why I call my
gang the Zhengtai Gang.

22:04.626 --> 22:05.626
Awesome, right?

22:05.792 --> 22:06.459
Join us.

22:07.459 --> 22:09.542
I'll introduce you to my girl.

22:10.001 --> 22:11.292
I'm in!

22:12.251 --> 22:14.709
Hey, didn't one of your guys
just jump into the river?

22:15.167 --> 22:16.001
Oh, it's fine.

22:18.001 --> 22:18.667
Mumu!

22:18.959 --> 22:19.584
Mumu!

22:20.084 --> 22:21.209
Mumu!

22:22.542 --> 22:23.792
Mumu, come here!

22:24.209 --> 22:25.584
Mumu, come here!

22:26.376 --> 22:27.459
Oh, there you are!

22:28.834 --> 22:30.167
Easy, Mumu. Good boy.

22:30.376 --> 22:31.876
Go find Liu Yi.

22:32.584 --> 22:33.334
Go!

22:35.167 --> 22:36.709
He's a Golden Retriever.

22:37.334 --> 22:38.584
The first in town.

22:38.709 --> 22:39.959
And the only in town.

22:40.376 --> 22:42.084
They're used as search dogs abroad.

22:42.751 --> 22:43.501
You'll see.

22:44.542 --> 22:45.751
Mumu!

22:46.001 --> 22:47.000
Mumu...

22:47.084 --> 22:47.667
Mumu...

22:47.917 --> 22:48.792
Mumu!

22:50.459 --> 22:51.167
Mumu...

22:53.334 --> 22:54.459
Mumu...

22:54.584 --> 22:55.251
Mumu!

22:55.792 --> 22:56.459
Mumu...

22:58.042 --> 22:58.709
Mumu...

23:00.542 --> 23:01.876
Louder!

23:01.959 --> 23:03.417
It's because of you Mumu got lost!

23:04.167 --> 23:04.917
Mumu!

23:05.417 --> 23:06.334
Louder!

23:06.376 --> 23:07.126
Mumu!

23:09.626 --> 23:10.667
Mumu!

23:27.376 --> 23:29.542
Mumu, how'd you get so skinny?

23:30.042 --> 23:32.001
That's clearly not Mumu.

23:32.167 --> 23:33.126
Wait, Lang.

23:33.667 --> 23:34.292
Look.

23:34.626 --> 23:35.542
That guy...

23:35.876 --> 23:38.542
The one in the middle is Luo Li.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.417
Our sworn enemy.

23:40.501 --> 23:43.001
Didn't realize he'd gotten into
the car smuggling business.

23:44.917 --> 23:46.917
These rats are armed with guns, boss.

23:47.001 --> 23:48.584
Should we load some cannons?

23:49.751 --> 23:51.751
That can't be a real gun.

23:52.126 --> 23:53.501
Real or fake, we ain't afraid.

24:00.501 --> 24:02.459
Well, if it's okay,
can I get going?

24:02.584 --> 24:04.667
I'm halfway through coding a program.

24:05.209 --> 24:06.876
Coding a program?

24:10.834 --> 24:12.459
Hey, let's go eat at my girl's place!

24:12.501 --> 24:12.751
Okay.

24:17.584 --> 24:18.251
Lang,

24:18.292 --> 24:19.834
My girl makes quite the fish

24:21.959 --> 24:23.042
Here comes the fish!

24:26.042 --> 24:26.751
Oops

24:26.792 --> 24:28.376
Oh, I forgot vinegar.

24:28.959 --> 24:29.626
C'mon,

24:30.209 --> 24:31.584
it's just a fish.

24:32.251 --> 24:33.292
Lang...

24:34.501 --> 24:35.542
She is coming...

24:35.751 --> 24:36.917
Hurry!

24:42.501 --> 24:43.084
Hot, too hot!

24:45.834 --> 24:46.626
Ma'am...

24:47.001 --> 24:48.251
Just call me Hua.

24:48.501 --> 24:49.376
What's your full name?

24:49.501 --> 24:50.751
Leave it! Hua is good.

24:50.834 --> 24:51.959
I don't like my real name.

24:52.501 --> 24:53.584
Just call me Hua.

24:53.626 --> 24:54.667
Names come from our parents.

24:54.751 --> 24:56.584
It's not your fault.

24:56.709 --> 24:57.584
What's your name?

24:59.417 --> 25:00.292
Niu Aihua.

25:00.376 --> 25:01.917
You're better off with just Hua.

25:04.626 --> 25:06.792
I have no recollections of my mother,

25:07.126 --> 25:09.876
except for some blurry
black and white photos.

25:10.459 --> 25:11.917
When I was born,

25:12.001 --> 25:13.792
my dad was already locked up.

25:14.501 --> 25:16.626
My mom's name was Zhang Suzhen,

25:17.126 --> 25:18.376
not Niu Aihua.

25:19.501 --> 25:21.584
But their faces are kinda similar.

25:22.334 --> 25:25.584
Seems like my dad has a type.

25:27.126 --> 25:27.751
No!

25:28.584 --> 25:30.959
I can't let this go on.

25:31.417 --> 25:33.001
I've got to find my mom, Zhang Suzhen,

25:33.084 --> 25:34.501
and introduce her to my dad.

25:34.792 --> 25:36.626
Otherwise,

25:37.542 --> 25:39.376
I won't exist anymore!

25:41.542 --> 25:43.751
How serious are you two?

25:44.292 --> 25:45.209
We're getting married next month.

25:46.959 --> 25:47.584
Have a drink.

25:47.626 --> 25:48.417
C'mon.

25:51.459 --> 25:52.792
Marriage is a big step.

25:53.209 --> 25:54.417
You should really take it seriously.

25:54.709 --> 25:57.376
It takes at least a year
or two to truly know someone...

25:57.709 --> 25:59.209
To know what you're getting into...

25:59.709 --> 26:01.126
How long have you known each other?

26:01.209 --> 26:02.042
Over twenty years.

26:05.042 --> 26:07.417
I wasn't even four years old
when I met Hua for the first time.

26:07.501 --> 26:08.751
I was living next door.

26:08.792 --> 26:10.167
Her mom had just given birth

26:10.501 --> 26:11.501
and was breastfeeding her.

26:11.709 --> 26:12.459
It was love at first sight.

26:12.542 --> 26:13.667
What do you know at four?

26:13.834 --> 26:15.542
A lot. I knew I wasn't three.

26:15.792 --> 26:16.542
Right.

26:20.084 --> 26:21.209
I'll get it!

26:23.001 --> 26:24.084
You got it?

26:24.334 --> 26:24.917
Found it!

26:25.042 --> 26:25.917
Muah...

26:28.626 --> 26:30.751
They really are in love.

26:31.251 --> 26:33.542
Seems like I have no choice
but to step in myself.

26:34.001 --> 26:36.667
Dad, forgive me.

26:40.334 --> 26:41.709
I feel like I've seen you before.

26:43.376 --> 26:44.459
Really?

26:46.001 --> 26:47.292
Maybe.

26:51.251 --> 26:52.584
Do you like watching movies?

26:52.792 --> 26:53.876
Yeah.

26:54.542 --> 26:56.084
Wanna go see one together?

26:57.376 --> 26:58.459
Sure.

27:00.292 --> 27:01.834
7 pm tomorrow.

27:02.459 --> 27:03.876
I'll wait for you at the bridge.

27:04.917 --> 27:05.792
Sounds good.

27:06.376 --> 27:08.001
I'm off work.

27:13.126 --> 27:13.834
Alright, Zheng...

27:13.876 --> 27:14.917
I gotta go!

27:14.959 --> 27:16.251
Enjoy your meal.

27:34.209 --> 27:35.667
Honey, are you okay?

27:38.459 --> 27:39.667
Son of a bitch!

27:43.292 --> 27:44.126
Why

27:44.709 --> 27:46.001
Did you hit my car?

27:46.209 --> 27:47.501
This is your car?

27:47.626 --> 27:50.042
Zhiqiang gave you this car to drive.

27:50.209 --> 27:52.376
He can't keep waiting.

27:53.709 --> 27:54.876
Soon.

27:55.417 --> 27:57.042
It'll be settled in a day or two.

27:57.417 --> 27:59.376
Get it done right away.

28:00.001 --> 28:01.542
How do you still find time

28:02.167 --> 28:03.542
to fuck some chick?

28:03.876 --> 28:04.959
Not some chick.

28:05.084 --> 28:06.251
My wife.

28:15.542 --> 28:16.959
Sorry honey.

28:18.917 --> 28:19.626
Let's go home.

29:09.251 --> 29:10.209
Zheng,

29:11.292 --> 29:14.917
Do you know a girl named Zhang Suzhen?

29:15.251 --> 29:16.501
Of course.

29:16.834 --> 29:19.001
At the foot of Mt. Qingcheng...

29:19.126 --> 29:21.042
That's Bai Suzhen.

29:21.959 --> 29:23.126
Honey...

29:25.626 --> 29:26.542
Umm...

29:26.584 --> 29:28.459
How many guys are there in the gang?

29:28.959 --> 29:30.292
Four.

29:30.459 --> 29:31.916
The average Joe can't get past

29:31.917 --> 29:34.292
my special initiation test.

29:34.667 --> 29:36.001
Most just give up.

29:36.126 --> 29:38.167
Only Liu Yi and Ma made it to the end.

29:39.126 --> 29:41.376
Does that mean I've already passed?

29:43.709 --> 29:45.001
It hasn't started yet.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.876
This is just a trial period.

29:47.667 --> 29:49.001
Hear that, Jiayi?

29:49.042 --> 29:50.209
Nothing is too hard for me!

29:50.251 --> 29:51.542
Liu Yi, move your head!

29:51.584 --> 29:53.209
I can't see Leslie Cheung.

29:56.042 --> 29:57.042
Be right back.

30:07.251 --> 30:10.292
Three times in one movie? What the hell?

30:10.584 --> 30:12.001
How are we supposed to watch this crap?

30:12.917 --> 30:13.417
What a waste!

30:13.459 --> 30:14.292
I'm never coming back here!

30:14.334 --> 30:15.001
Never, never!

30:16.126 --> 30:16.542
Let's go!

30:16.667 --> 30:17.084
Excuse me!

30:17.126 --> 30:18.001
I'm never coming back here!

30:18.292 --> 30:19.084
Never again!

30:21.667 --> 30:22.417
What happened?

30:22.459 --> 30:23.334
Liu Yi,

30:23.876 --> 30:25.084
what's that stick for?

30:28.251 --> 30:29.292
Jiayi...

30:29.542 --> 30:30.417
For you.

30:32.334 --> 30:33.084
Liu Yi,

30:33.292 --> 30:34.667
I have someone already.

30:34.959 --> 30:35.709
Well where is he now?

30:35.834 --> 30:36.751
I'm gonna kick his ass.

30:40.417 --> 30:41.542
Uh, Hua...

30:41.584 --> 30:42.626
I've gotta run.

30:42.876 --> 30:43.542
I'll see ya.

30:43.584 --> 30:44.417
Thanks for your hard work.

30:44.917 --> 30:45.542
Jiayi...

30:45.626 --> 30:46.459
Let her go.

30:47.167 --> 30:48.876
She's got someone else already.

30:49.001 --> 30:51.001
If a girl's not into you,

30:51.126 --> 30:52.042
there's nothing you can do.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.126
Liu Yi...

30:58.917 --> 31:01.542
You two clearly didn't have chemistry.

31:01.834 --> 31:02.917
Liu Yi,

31:03.834 --> 31:05.959
stay cool when you tell
a girl you like her.

31:06.042 --> 31:06.834
Keep it casual.

31:06.959 --> 31:07.917
Exactly.

31:08.126 --> 31:10.626
Surprises only come when
they're not forced.

31:11.709 --> 31:12.917
Like this!

31:14.667 --> 31:15.667
Marry me.

31:24.001 --> 31:25.376
It's got a diamond.

31:26.917 --> 31:27.792
Kneel down.

31:31.042 --> 31:32.042
Okay.

31:32.126 --> 31:33.126
Let's do it.

31:39.792 --> 31:40.792
Let's go home!

31:45.001 --> 31:46.376
Three bowls of noodles!

31:46.542 --> 31:48.292
We've got a new member
today so make them good!

31:53.792 --> 31:54.959
Zheng...

31:55.751 --> 31:56.709
What does your...

31:56.751 --> 31:57.459
No.

31:58.001 --> 32:00.667
What does our group actually do?

32:01.917 --> 32:04.042
Well now that you've reached
the top level of management.

32:04.126 --> 32:05.501
Let me tell you what's
under our jurisdiction.

32:05.542 --> 32:06.626
Hold on.

32:06.876 --> 32:08.084
You're that shorthanded,

32:08.251 --> 32:09.959
I already made it to the top?

32:10.001 --> 32:11.376
This entire town is ours.

32:12.167 --> 32:15.501
But right now, the most important thing

32:15.751 --> 32:16.709
is our negotiation with Luo Li.

32:16.751 --> 32:19.959
And, we've got to hold onto
the Beloved Karaoke Bar.

32:20.542 --> 32:23.084
We can't let him take it.

32:23.292 --> 32:26.501
Every girl there comes from
a good local family.

32:26.584 --> 32:27.876
We've gotta look after them.

32:29.042 --> 32:29.834
My dream is to keep these places safe.

32:29.876 --> 32:32.209
Karaoke bars just for singing,

32:32.834 --> 32:34.709
Bathhouses just for bathing.

32:36.084 --> 32:37.376
That is a dream.

32:39.084 --> 32:40.501
Look, this is the man we want to be like.

32:40.584 --> 32:41.667
Du Yuesheng!

32:42.417 --> 32:43.167
That's 6 yuan!

32:48.042 --> 32:50.167
Boss, bring us some more pickles!

32:50.292 --> 32:51.167
Okay.

32:51.667 --> 32:53.667
Last month I owed you 20 yuan.

32:53.792 --> 32:55.917
Let's say this is 10 yuan.

32:56.501 --> 32:57.751
Here's 10 yuan and we're settled.

32:58.126 --> 32:58.917
Okay.

32:59.084 --> 33:01.501
By the way,
our circuit breaker is shot,

33:01.876 --> 33:03.584
and the roof is leaking.

33:03.751 --> 33:04.709
Can you get them fixed?

33:04.917 --> 33:05.876
Alright.

33:08.459 --> 33:09.501
See?

33:10.042 --> 33:11.084
Protection money.

33:12.584 --> 33:14.001
How is that protection money?

33:14.501 --> 33:15.667
More like property management fee

33:18.792 --> 33:19.917
Stay cool in there.

33:20.501 --> 33:22.542
Welcome!

33:26.834 --> 33:28.292
Come on, sing whatever.

33:30.834 --> 33:32.084
I know this song.

33:32.792 --> 33:37.459
There is laughter and there are tears

33:37.501 --> 33:43.917
Who can, who can get away?

33:44.626 --> 33:49.667
You say life is rosy and I never contested

33:49.792 --> 33:54.959
You say life is dark and I had no words

33:55.501 --> 33:59.834
Only in silence can I bare it all

34:00.251 --> 34:06.251
Bare the countless coming of the seasons

34:08.167 --> 34:10.167
Come on in, girls!

34:10.626 --> 34:11.917
Pick out a couple.

34:12.083 --> 34:14.501
These are all good girls.

34:14.708 --> 34:15.751
Even a touch on the leg isn't allowed.

34:15.792 --> 34:16.292
What?

34:17.417 --> 34:19.458
Then why open a karaoke
bar in the first place?

34:19.501 --> 34:20.501
Liu Yi, you pick one.

34:21.001 --> 34:22.501
It's so embarrassing.

34:23.042 --> 34:24.792
I'm still a virgin.

34:25.958 --> 34:27.417
Then choose the one from last time.

34:27.501 --> 34:28.667
Okay, that one.

34:28.708 --> 34:29.708
Jiayi!

34:30.501 --> 34:31.917
Jiayi, come here!

34:34.501 --> 34:34.917
Take this.

34:34.958 --> 34:36.083
It's gonna be dangerous in here.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.001
There may be a shootout.

34:38.083 --> 34:40.251
Sing for us outside,
and don't come in!

34:40.333 --> 34:41.792
Here's 50 yuan.

34:44.751 --> 34:45.667
Take it.

34:46.501 --> 34:47.417
Don't come in.

34:48.126 --> 34:48.626
Everyone out.

34:48.792 --> 34:49.542
Go, go.

34:49.751 --> 34:50.583
Quickly!

34:55.458 --> 34:57.126
Watch how you handle yourselves.

34:58.001 --> 34:59.501
Don't talk shit.

34:59.626 --> 35:01.542
Keep your voices low.

35:02.292 --> 35:04.417
If we speak quietly,

35:04.584 --> 35:06.584
they'll have to lean it to listen.

35:07.084 --> 35:10.251
That way we'll have the upper hand.

35:11.251 --> 35:12.042
Got it.

35:13.209 --> 35:14.042
Do you think

35:14.084 --> 35:16.334
this could be the end of the Zhengtai Gang?

35:16.751 --> 35:18.292
Then we need a gang sign.

35:18.959 --> 35:20.751
Whoever makes it out alive

35:20.834 --> 35:23.626
must continue to expand the Zhengtai Gang.

35:27.001 --> 35:28.459
I haven't thought of one.

35:28.959 --> 35:30.001
How about this?

35:32.001 --> 35:33.876
That's too simple.

35:38.501 --> 35:39.084
Then this?

35:53.501 --> 35:54.834
Don't touch me!

35:57.959 --> 35:59.209
Fuck, that's my girl!

36:00.334 --> 36:03.126
Turn off the music, join in the singing.

36:08.042 --> 36:09.376
You've got a girl?

36:11.001 --> 36:13.792
Remember, silence is a
source of great strength.

36:23.292 --> 36:25.167
What, cat got your tongue?

36:34.584 --> 36:35.959
The guy in green is new.

36:36.084 --> 36:37.376
He is pretty calm, huh?

36:37.876 --> 36:40.126
But you're also blind, boy.

36:40.751 --> 36:42.584
Why serve this loser?

36:44.084 --> 36:45.959
You're not even on the cops' radar.

36:46.251 --> 36:47.251
What a waste of time!

36:48.751 --> 36:50.209
This karaoke bar

36:50.667 --> 36:51.876
has always been ours.

36:51.917 --> 36:54.126
The girls do nothing but sing.

36:54.709 --> 36:56.334
Sexing them up like this

36:56.459 --> 36:58.251
is false advertising.

36:58.334 --> 36:59.001
Am I right?

36:59.834 --> 37:01.209
If the girls aren't willing to do it,
How to do?

37:01.292 --> 37:03.126
Then don't tease your customers.

37:04.042 --> 37:06.917
You want both money and reputation?

37:06.959 --> 37:08.042
No fucking way.

37:08.167 --> 37:10.167
That is a bit bad...

37:15.459 --> 37:17.459
But not as bad as you.

37:19.376 --> 37:20.834
All the girls here

37:20.917 --> 37:22.001
are under my protection.

37:22.042 --> 37:22.792
Yeah, yeah.

37:23.084 --> 37:24.042
You

37:24.167 --> 37:25.917
gotta stop watching so
many Hong Kong movies.

37:28.334 --> 37:29.417
These glasses...

37:31.751 --> 37:32.917
Look familiar?

37:33.001 --> 37:35.001
Think over carefully what I've said.

37:35.584 --> 37:36.792
I'll give you...

37:37.751 --> 37:39.084
One week.

37:48.501 --> 37:50.084
What do the glasses mean?

37:57.709 --> 37:59.417
That he's blown away by our vision.

38:11.876 --> 38:14.251
Can you give me my glasses?

38:14.792 --> 38:16.959
Shut up and eat!

38:28.584 --> 38:29.751
Boss...

38:30.709 --> 38:31.792
Stop feeding him.

38:31.876 --> 38:33.792
You're gonna develop a bond with him.

38:43.917 --> 38:46.917
We probably didn't get someone
in core management.

38:49.459 --> 38:50.834
But supposedly,

38:51.084 --> 38:52.626
in this line of business,

38:53.001 --> 38:54.834
even if you snatch a nobody,

38:55.001 --> 38:57.334
the boss would come and save him!

38:58.292 --> 39:00.626
They respond passively to our aggression.

39:01.251 --> 39:02.376
Kinda put us in an awkward position.

39:02.417 --> 39:03.417
Let's just kill him!

39:03.459 --> 39:04.709
One clean shot

39:04.792 --> 39:06.626
and dump his body outside the bar!

39:06.667 --> 39:08.167
You fucking stupid?

39:08.876 --> 39:10.334
Murder is illegal!

39:10.501 --> 39:12.126
You wanna end up on death row?

39:13.584 --> 39:14.542
I'm telling you.

39:14.792 --> 39:17.209
We can't kill him.

39:17.292 --> 39:18.126
Thank you.

39:23.751 --> 39:26.292
Fuck, now I've shown my hand.

39:33.167 --> 39:34.667
Boss! Boss!

39:37.417 --> 39:40.084
Did I ask for your fucking advice?

40:06.709 --> 40:09.542
Boss, I don't think they're
using any strategy.

40:09.792 --> 40:12.959
They probably don't even realize
they're missing a man.

40:13.417 --> 40:14.709
I agree.

40:16.501 --> 40:17.459
Boss...

40:17.501 --> 40:20.084
What if we take that girl?

40:20.251 --> 40:21.584
We don't touch women!

40:22.584 --> 40:24.792
Then how about that Liu Yi?

40:25.792 --> 40:27.042
No virgins either.

40:27.209 --> 40:29.834
What if we take their boss?

40:30.292 --> 40:32.876
Have you no respect for the rules?

40:33.417 --> 40:34.834
What is our stance?

40:34.917 --> 40:37.792
We solve problems through negotiation.

40:38.001 --> 40:40.751
That's why all we need
is a bargaining chip.

40:40.959 --> 40:42.792
If we kidnap the negotiator,

40:43.042 --> 40:44.167
how bad is it gonna look?

40:44.751 --> 40:45.751
How embarrassing!

40:46.417 --> 40:48.667
How shameful!

40:50.292 --> 40:52.626
They'll never think of me
as more than a petty criminal.

40:52.959 --> 40:55.459
What happens when I want to
transit to business and politics?

40:56.792 --> 40:57.709
Boss...

40:59.042 --> 41:01.626
Then there's only one guy left to take.

41:11.209 --> 41:12.709
That one.

41:12.792 --> 41:13.959
Top Gun

41:14.751 --> 41:15.584
Lang...

41:16.001 --> 41:16.751
Look.

41:17.501 --> 41:19.334
I bet you've never seen
so many videotapes, huh?

41:21.417 --> 41:22.292
Not bad, right?

41:22.876 --> 41:23.876
Try 'em on.

41:24.042 --> 41:24.792
You'll look good!

41:24.959 --> 41:25.667
Come,

41:27.959 --> 41:28.667
Follow me.

41:32.334 --> 41:33.501
Cinemas

41:33.584 --> 41:35.584
have no future.

41:35.709 --> 41:38.292
Video halls like mine will rule.

41:38.584 --> 41:42.209
But aren't DVDs all the rage now?

41:42.501 --> 41:43.876
VCDs are nothing.

41:44.084 --> 41:46.126
My boss just installed an A.C.
in the video hall.

41:46.167 --> 41:48.334
You think most video halls
can afford an A.C.?

41:48.376 --> 41:50.792
That's right, they'll still
have to watch it here.

41:51.834 --> 41:54.376
You gotta invest more to earn more.

41:55.459 --> 41:56.209
Lang...

41:56.959 --> 41:57.501
You got money?

41:57.542 --> 41:58.167
Yeah.

41:58.584 --> 42:00.084
Let's open one together.

42:00.126 --> 42:00.917
I didn't bring any.

42:02.292 --> 42:03.709
Listen, video halls are dead.

42:03.751 --> 42:05.042
Open a cinema.

42:05.251 --> 42:06.792
How can I be wrong?

42:06.959 --> 42:08.709
You'll see when you grow up.

42:11.126 --> 42:11.417
Lang,

42:11.459 --> 42:12.209
Come here!

42:13.334 --> 42:14.209
I talk to you

42:14.501 --> 42:16.209
I just got 500 more video cassettes,

42:16.292 --> 42:17.501
and I'm fixing up the place in a few days.

42:17.542 --> 42:18.751
Just wait and see!

42:21.334 --> 42:23.376
No wonder we were so poor.

42:24.584 --> 42:26.959
You've been with the same woman
for over twenty years.

42:27.417 --> 42:28.459
Aren't you bored?

42:28.542 --> 42:29.292
Sure.

42:30.251 --> 42:31.001
I gotta piss!

42:31.084 --> 42:31.917
Me too!

42:38.501 --> 42:41.084
But I like the boredom.

42:42.376 --> 42:43.251
Listen,

42:43.709 --> 42:44.959
in a man's life...

42:47.084 --> 42:47.834
I say

42:48.709 --> 42:51.292
We take the guy for a ride this time,
should be more important than Ma

42:56.501 --> 42:57.792
You took Ma?

42:58.376 --> 42:59.084
Shut up!

43:17.334 --> 43:18.209
Gas!

43:19.917 --> 43:20.751
Turn!

43:41.042 --> 43:41.542
Lang,

43:41.667 --> 43:42.459
you can drive?

43:43.126 --> 43:44.251
They took Ma!

43:45.209 --> 43:46.001
Get in, I'll drive.

43:46.209 --> 43:46.959
Come on, let's go.

43:47.251 --> 43:47.917
Let's go!

43:49.459 --> 43:50.292
Let's go!

44:04.126 --> 44:05.542
Follow them!

44:18.667 --> 44:19.709
Honey...

44:19.792 --> 44:21.334
How do you like

44:21.501 --> 44:22.376
the Japanese food today?

44:24.209 --> 44:25.667
Baby, you're the best!

44:28.626 --> 44:30.126
Huang Zhiqiang promised

44:30.376 --> 44:32.001
after this batch of smuggled cars,

44:32.334 --> 44:34.417
he'll quit the business

44:34.667 --> 44:36.126
and bring me into the real estate game.

44:36.626 --> 44:39.209
Then I won't have to watch cars all day.

44:40.667 --> 44:42.501
You won't have to work so hard.

44:45.126 --> 44:46.834
But... will you still break the law?

44:47.792 --> 44:49.876
Maybe just a little.

44:50.751 --> 44:52.001
A man like me

44:52.876 --> 44:55.459
has to take some risk to drive a nice car

44:55.584 --> 44:57.209
and take my girl out for a spin.

45:01.376 --> 45:03.001
One day when I'm rich,

45:03.667 --> 45:05.292
I'll get you a real gold chain.

45:16.792 --> 45:18.042
Honey...

45:19.459 --> 45:21.167
I know you love Japan...

45:22.459 --> 45:24.667
but right now,

45:25.792 --> 45:28.334
I can only give you this world.

45:30.126 --> 45:31.501
I learned a Japanese song.

45:31.542 --> 45:32.834
Let me sing it for you.

45:35.709 --> 45:37.334
<i>♪ Oh my love ♪</i>

45:37.792 --> 45:42.917

47:45.376 --> 47:47.542
Here's to Ma's safe return,

47:47.834 --> 47:49.709
eliminating our main rival,

47:49.876 --> 47:51.292
and taking control of the town!

47:51.792 --> 47:52.334
Cheers!

47:52.417 --> 47:53.251
Cheers!

47:57.584 --> 47:58.209
Your rescue

47:58.251 --> 47:59.209
was just like in the movies,

47:59.292 --> 48:00.209
Why didn't you take me?

48:00.334 --> 48:01.501
Think about it, Liu Yi!

48:02.126 --> 48:03.792
If we brought you, what would happen

48:03.959 --> 48:05.542
if they took us all out?

48:05.667 --> 48:07.001
It'd be the end of Zhengtai Gang.

48:07.792 --> 48:08.792
I'm that important?

48:09.959 --> 48:10.667
Ma...

48:11.459 --> 48:13.376
Fortune favors those
who survive the kiss of death!

48:15.417 --> 48:16.709
Actually, these past few days

48:16.876 --> 48:20.667
I've been thinking about the importance of
real-time information and communication.

48:21.584 --> 48:22.459
Know what I mean?

48:22.501 --> 48:25.376
I'm working on an online
communication program.

48:25.501 --> 48:26.542
Oh, please...

48:26.792 --> 48:28.084
You lose your dial-up connection

48:28.167 --> 48:29.709
whenever a phone call comes in.

48:30.667 --> 48:31.501
We all use this now.

48:31.542 --> 48:32.834
Beepers.

48:33.792 --> 48:35.292
No one needs your computer program.

48:36.459 --> 48:37.459
You can't fight,

48:37.501 --> 48:38.792
and you have no actual skills.

48:39.501 --> 48:40.834
How will you survive?

48:41.876 --> 48:43.501
The world is a bleak place.

48:43.834 --> 48:44.959
No it's not.

48:46.167 --> 48:47.584
People aren't glued to their cell phones.

48:48.042 --> 48:51.584
They're not constantly
checking WeChat or Weibo.

48:51.667 --> 48:53.001
They have to use tracking dogs

48:53.292 --> 48:54.876
instead of stalking each other with a GPS!

48:55.251 --> 48:56.126
Not bleak at all.

48:58.167 --> 48:59.959
Lang, you're drunk. I
didn't get any of that.

49:00.042 --> 49:00.959
You understand him?

49:01.084 --> 49:03.334
Boss, if you don't, how could I?

49:06.584 --> 49:08.209
How far along with the program are you?

49:08.292 --> 49:09.709
The kidnapping gave me to time to think.

49:09.792 --> 49:11.417
I was able to focus

49:11.667 --> 49:14.459
and I figured out the problem.

49:14.584 --> 49:15.959
I'll be done in a few days.

49:16.001 --> 49:17.417
Got a name yet?

49:17.459 --> 49:18.459
I think I'll call it

49:18.626 --> 49:20.459
OICQ.

49:23.417 --> 49:24.542
Ma...

49:25.709 --> 49:27.084
that's your surname?

49:27.417 --> 49:29.417
Obviously.

49:29.501 --> 49:30.167
And your first name?

49:30.209 --> 49:30.959
Huateng

49:32.834 --> 49:33.459
Lang,

49:33.542 --> 49:35.376
The toilet's in the back.

49:38.251 --> 49:40.417
But I gotta tell you guys,

49:40.584 --> 49:40.876
Say

49:40.917 --> 49:43.834
I'm still pretty lost.

49:43.876 --> 49:44.792
Here.

49:44.959 --> 49:46.126
Don't be lost.

49:47.042 --> 49:48.167
How about

49:48.459 --> 49:49.709
working at my video hall?

49:49.876 --> 49:51.292
500 yuan a month!

49:51.792 --> 49:53.126
Please don't!

49:53.876 --> 49:55.167
Ma, listen to me...

49:55.292 --> 49:56.917
Sell your computer.

49:57.376 --> 49:59.542
Stockpile a ton of beepers.

50:00.084 --> 50:02.667
A good beeper number will be worth
a fortune in the future.

50:02.792 --> 50:04.667
Maybe all of us should just stock beepers.

50:05.709 --> 50:07.584
In five years, we'll sell 'em

50:07.959 --> 50:08.917
and we'll be fucking loaded!

50:09.084 --> 50:10.751
Liu Yi, that ain't half bad.

50:12.167 --> 50:13.208
You're usually dumb as a rock.

50:13.209 --> 50:14.792
Who'd have thought

50:14.959 --> 50:16.542
you actually have some business sense?

50:16.626 --> 50:17.167
Yeah!

50:17.209 --> 50:20.209
I'm gonna be the richest
out of all you guys.

50:20.251 --> 50:20.584
Yeah!

50:20.667 --> 50:21.834
Let's drink to that. Cheers!

50:23.376 --> 50:25.251
I guess I'll be the poorest then.

50:25.959 --> 50:26.667
How's this?

50:26.876 --> 50:29.459
I'll join your beeper scheme
after I'm done with my program.

50:29.501 --> 50:30.126
Ma...

50:30.542 --> 50:31.959
Follow you own path.

50:32.001 --> 50:34.792
I think he should follow mine.

50:35.334 --> 50:36.376
It's for his own good.

50:36.834 --> 50:39.001
You haven't change at all.
Still the fucking same.

50:39.334 --> 50:40.042
What'd you say?

50:40.376 --> 50:40.917
Louder...

50:40.959 --> 50:42.334
You never change!

50:44.292 --> 50:45.126
That's right!

50:48.876 --> 50:49.667
Liu Yi...

50:49.876 --> 50:51.251
What's that line again?

51:00.501 --> 51:03.126
I'm just like this world!

51:03.626 --> 51:06.709
This world will never change!

51:10.876 --> 51:14.042
This world is going to change.

51:16.042 --> 51:17.792
This world will definitely change.

51:18.501 --> 51:19.959
You don't belong here.

51:20.334 --> 51:21.542
Time to go.

51:50.792 --> 51:51.709
Looking for me?

51:52.042 --> 51:53.501
The TV's broken.

52:01.251 --> 52:01.876
All good.

52:01.917 --> 52:03.334
Good.

52:06.876 --> 52:08.751
Wanna watch together?

52:20.126 --> 52:22.792
Am I supposed to be watching
TV or watching you?

52:26.084 --> 52:27.792
Um... where's Zhengtai?

52:28.792 --> 52:30.167
He's out.

52:30.626 --> 52:32.917
He won't be back for awhile.

52:36.084 --> 52:37.251
Come over here.

52:43.167 --> 52:44.876
I knew this woman had issues.

52:45.001 --> 52:45.876
Dad,

52:46.709 --> 52:49.209
For your happiness and my existence...

52:49.376 --> 52:50.417
Today...

52:50.459 --> 52:52.876
Let me handle this.

52:53.626 --> 52:54.917
So stuffy.

52:55.792 --> 52:57.459
Lemme open the window.

53:28.334 --> 53:29.584
Wanna change the channel?

53:43.542 --> 53:44.751
This one's good.

53:56.834 --> 53:58.126
Niu Aihua...

53:59.376 --> 54:01.417
I really hate that name.

54:08.334 --> 54:10.501
I hate my father too.

54:13.834 --> 54:18.084
He was never around.

54:18.376 --> 54:19.792
Shh...

54:22.167 --> 54:24.667
I never liked my father either.

54:27.126 --> 54:29.917
I really like the name Bai Suzhen.

54:32.167 --> 54:37.459
I think our lots in life
are pretty similar.

54:39.626 --> 54:42.251
I'm gonna go to the police station
before I get married...

54:44.167 --> 54:45.834
And change my name.

54:47.251 --> 54:49.209
I want to take my mother's surname.

54:50.126 --> 54:53.667
What do you think of this?

54:55.792 --> 54:57.209
Zhang Suzhen...

55:06.834 --> 55:07.584
How...

55:07.626 --> 55:09.751
How can we do this? What about Zhengtai?

55:10.959 --> 55:11.917
It doesn't matter.

55:11.959 --> 55:13.126
It does!

55:14.084 --> 55:15.417
A lot!

55:16.209 --> 55:17.126
Good.

55:18.001 --> 55:19.251
You've passed the test.

55:22.459 --> 55:23.792
Come out now, honey!

55:26.751 --> 55:27.709
Lang...

55:28.042 --> 55:29.376
You're a real man!

55:32.501 --> 55:34.084
You guys are so fucked up!

55:34.542 --> 55:35.834
Don't say that.

55:35.959 --> 55:36.959
We had to.

55:39.209 --> 55:40.584
You needed a test.

55:40.709 --> 55:42.251
A difficult test.

55:42.376 --> 55:44.376
How else could I know
what you're really about?

55:44.751 --> 55:46.626
I know you're pretty confused right now.

55:46.792 --> 55:48.126
I know exactly how you feel.

55:49.376 --> 55:50.751
You don't know jack shit!

55:51.292 --> 55:52.626
Honey, how was my performance?

55:52.917 --> 55:55.126
Perfect! You were really into it.

55:57.542 --> 55:59.042
Very few have passed this test.

55:59.334 --> 56:00.251
That's why the Zhengtai Gang

56:00.292 --> 56:02.084
is so select.

56:04.209 --> 56:05.459
The idea is...

56:05.792 --> 56:07.834
Just in case anything happens to me,

56:08.584 --> 56:11.251
the Zhengtai Gang has someone
to carry on our name.

56:14.334 --> 56:15.459
I...

56:17.876 --> 56:21.376
I'm not sure how long I can stay here.

56:21.834 --> 56:23.376
What about Liu Yi?

56:23.709 --> 56:24.792
He's good.

56:25.417 --> 56:26.626
Liu Yi?

56:27.959 --> 56:29.167
He's too slow.

56:29.917 --> 56:31.251
He'll never make it.

56:33.501 --> 56:35.542
He could never be a leader.

56:58.584 --> 56:59.209
Liu Yi

56:59.334 --> 56:59.834
Get down here!

56:59.876 --> 57:01.126
No, you come up!

57:02.501 --> 57:03.626
Tell me the truth,

57:03.917 --> 57:05.042
how long were you hiding?

57:05.334 --> 57:07.042
And why the fuck were you in there?

57:09.709 --> 57:11.584
I was looking for you earlier.
The door was open,

57:11.626 --> 57:12.751
so I came in,

57:12.959 --> 57:14.292
but no one was there.

57:14.751 --> 57:17.084
Then I saw Hua bring Lang in,

57:17.501 --> 57:19.001
so I snuck into the closet.

57:23.167 --> 57:25.667
Thank god we didn't hide
in the same closet.

57:26.792 --> 57:27.542
Boss,

57:27.584 --> 57:29.251
do you really think so little of me?

57:35.042 --> 57:36.167
Liu Yi...

57:37.167 --> 57:39.167
Everyone brings something to the table.

57:39.251 --> 57:41.667
Then tell me, what do I bring?

57:48.459 --> 57:49.959
There's gotta be something...

57:52.084 --> 57:52.959
Lang...

57:53.626 --> 57:56.209
Tell me, what do I bring?

58:14.542 --> 58:15.751
I see...

58:16.209 --> 58:17.584
Just wait.

58:20.876 --> 58:21.834
Liu Yi!

58:23.751 --> 58:25.416
One of these days,

58:25.417 --> 58:26.709
I'll show you what I can bring!

58:28.084 --> 58:29.209
What?

58:30.001 --> 58:31.417
What did you say?

58:37.959 --> 58:39.209
What's the matter, Lang?

58:41.209 --> 58:42.751
I need a moment.

58:44.167 --> 58:45.209
Sure.

58:47.001 --> 58:48.626
You know, I love the 90s.

58:49.584 --> 58:51.334
When you ask for a moment,

58:51.667 --> 58:54.459
no one asks you why.

58:56.376 --> 58:58.167
Plus, I get to see my mom.

58:59.001 --> 59:00.167
Who's your mom?

59:05.042 --> 59:05.792
I've gotta

59:05.834 --> 59:07.001
find someone.

59:07.667 --> 59:08.459
Promise me,

59:08.501 --> 59:09.834
don't go anywhere.

59:09.959 --> 59:11.251
Wait for me, okay?

59:15.751 --> 59:16.501
Lang!

59:17.834 --> 59:19.292
Don't go anywhere.

59:21.042 --> 59:22.751
Okay, I promise.

59:23.042 --> 59:26.501
I'm always a man of my word.

59:26.792 --> 59:27.709
Go.

01:00:50.501 --> 01:00:52.334
Lang, what are you doing here?

01:00:53.042 --> 01:00:54.917
I've been looking for you all night.

01:00:55.417 --> 01:00:56.834
I had the night shift.

01:00:57.501 --> 01:00:58.876
What's up?

01:00:59.376 --> 01:01:00.542
Nothing.

01:01:00.709 --> 01:01:01.959
Nothing really.

01:01:03.167 --> 01:01:05.376
Still not over yesterday, huh?

01:01:07.459 --> 01:01:10.459
Zheng likes a babe

01:01:10.626 --> 01:01:14.126
I had no idea he was this goofy
when he was younger...

01:01:15.584 --> 01:01:17.042
Especially after you were gone.

01:01:17.584 --> 01:01:19.167
What do you mean after I was gone?

01:01:19.334 --> 01:01:20.500
Sometime I feel like me and you

01:01:20.501 --> 01:01:22.876
are walking in completely separate worlds.

01:01:24.542 --> 01:01:27.584
You never talk about your family...

01:01:29.126 --> 01:01:30.167
I...

01:01:31.667 --> 01:01:34.292
My mom passed away when I was little.

01:01:34.876 --> 01:01:36.501
She jumped off a building.

01:01:36.709 --> 01:01:37.959
Postpartum depression.

01:01:38.167 --> 01:01:40.334
I never even got to call her mom.

01:01:40.459 --> 01:01:41.834
And your dad?

01:01:42.084 --> 01:01:44.001
He spent six years in jail.

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:46.751
He was released when I was six.

01:01:48.334 --> 01:01:50.709
He went from an immature boy...

01:01:50.792 --> 01:01:53.501
to an irritable man.

01:02:00.667 --> 01:02:02.834
My father is a test pilot.

01:02:04.251 --> 01:02:06.542
He wasn't around much when I was young.

01:02:07.376 --> 01:02:09.459
And eventually split with my mom.

01:02:12.209 --> 01:02:14.417
I invited him to the wedding.

01:02:15.501 --> 01:02:20.209
He declined, but said to gaze into the sky
and he'd be looking down.

01:02:30.251 --> 01:02:31.542
Do you think,

01:02:31.626 --> 01:02:34.084
the moment she left from that building,

01:02:35.584 --> 01:02:36.792
she felt regret?

01:02:39.167 --> 01:02:41.584
If she could see how her
son has turned out today,

01:02:42.376 --> 01:02:44.167
she'd be filled with regret.

01:02:49.084 --> 01:02:50.542
I think so too.

01:02:52.167 --> 01:02:53.667
I gotta go.

01:02:56.459 --> 01:02:57.251
Lang,

01:02:57.376 --> 01:02:58.959
I waited the whole night!

01:02:59.084 --> 01:03:01.501
I quit the bottle, but now I'm back at it.

01:03:17.001 --> 01:03:18.917
Can you promise me two things?

01:03:20.167 --> 01:03:21.042
Sure.

01:03:21.126 --> 01:03:22.417
What?

01:03:23.667 --> 01:03:26.584
Stay out of trouble the next few months.

01:03:28.792 --> 01:03:31.626
If no one pushes me, I won't push back.
But if someone pushes me...

01:03:31.667 --> 01:03:33.709
You still won't push back.

01:03:34.709 --> 01:03:36.667
Promise me.

01:03:39.709 --> 01:03:40.959
And the second thing?

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:43.251
Your wedding ceremony...

01:03:44.042 --> 01:03:45.667
Let me help plan it?

01:03:47.792 --> 01:03:49.876
Sure, whatever you say.

01:03:51.292 --> 01:03:53.126
Anything else I can promise you?

01:03:53.376 --> 01:03:54.459
Nope.

01:03:55.417 --> 01:03:56.001
Oh yeah,

01:03:56.126 --> 01:03:56.876
there is.

01:03:57.251 --> 01:03:58.459
Promise me,

01:03:58.709 --> 01:03:59.667
When you have a kid,

01:03:59.709 --> 01:04:01.542
don't kick him in the face
when you get mad.

01:04:02.126 --> 01:04:03.042
Why not?

01:04:04.084 --> 01:04:05.792
'Cause my dad always
kicked me in the face.

01:04:07.084 --> 01:04:09.167
Your dad sounds like a real asshole!

01:04:11.209 --> 01:04:12.459
Yeah, he is.

01:04:16.709 --> 01:04:18.292
Hey, there's smoke
coming from your house.

01:04:19.667 --> 01:04:20.917
Nah, that's not my house.

01:04:21.042 --> 01:04:22.876
Pretty sure it is.

01:04:23.834 --> 01:04:25.042
Let me check.

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:33.459
It really is my house!

01:05:18.584 --> 01:05:19.334
Zheng,

01:05:19.459 --> 01:05:21.166
I always thought you

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:22.667
valued money more than life.

01:05:23.084 --> 01:05:24.501
I never expected

01:05:24.626 --> 01:05:27.542
you'd risk your life
to save Grandpa's...

01:05:31.209 --> 01:05:33.251
I mean your father's portrait.

01:05:33.584 --> 01:05:35.459
I helped you save the urn.

01:05:37.126 --> 01:05:38.959
Although he's already dead.

01:05:39.084 --> 01:05:41.001
What's a little more fire gonna do.

01:05:43.167 --> 01:05:44.501
From this moment on,

01:05:44.834 --> 01:05:46.626
I have a whole new level
of respect for you.

01:05:46.959 --> 01:05:48.501
You're a great fucking son!

01:05:48.667 --> 01:05:50.334
Strong family values.

01:05:51.501 --> 01:05:52.834
Not entirely.

01:05:58.126 --> 01:05:59.334
Look...

01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:03.834
It's for my wedding.

01:06:04.417 --> 01:06:06.792
I was scared I'd blow it so I hid it there.

01:06:10.917 --> 01:06:12.001
Boss!

01:06:12.917 --> 01:06:14.209
Are you okay, boss?

01:06:14.501 --> 01:06:15.376
I'm fine.

01:06:15.459 --> 01:06:16.834
Where'd you run off to?

01:06:17.501 --> 01:06:18.334
I...

01:06:18.459 --> 01:06:19.042
What, cat got your tongue?

01:06:19.084 --> 01:06:19.709
C'mon,

01:06:20.001 --> 01:06:20.834
Follow me.

01:06:21.209 --> 01:06:22.167
Where are we going?

01:06:22.917 --> 01:06:23.417
Quickly!

01:06:31.334 --> 01:06:33.709
I think we're being followed.

01:06:34.209 --> 01:06:35.792
Then what should we do?

01:06:36.001 --> 01:06:37.084
The three of us

01:06:37.251 --> 01:06:38.167
must act together.

01:06:38.584 --> 01:06:39.084
Why?

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:45.917
Look...

01:06:47.209 --> 01:06:47.876
See?

01:06:48.292 --> 01:06:49.417
One chopstick...

01:06:57.167 --> 01:06:58.667
This is its fate.

01:07:03.376 --> 01:07:04.959
But three chopsticks together...

01:07:05.209 --> 01:07:06.084
Go on, try.

01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:18.751
Anyways...

01:07:19.042 --> 01:07:21.292
I was kidnapped when I was by myself,

01:07:21.334 --> 01:07:22.167
Right?

01:07:22.667 --> 01:07:23.626
So if we all act together,

01:07:23.667 --> 01:07:25.084
the three of us,

01:07:25.126 --> 01:07:26.876
we'll be safe.

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:27.959
Right?

01:07:32.167 --> 01:07:34.667
Boss! Boss! Boss!

01:07:39.209 --> 01:07:40.626
You burnt down my house, didn't you?

01:07:41.209 --> 01:07:43.084
You drove my car,

01:07:43.459 --> 01:07:44.959
crashed into my gate,

01:07:45.209 --> 01:07:47.001
and hurt my men.

01:07:47.209 --> 01:07:49.334
You own me quite a lot.

01:07:49.459 --> 01:07:53.126
I'd say burning down your
house makes us even.

01:07:57.376 --> 01:07:59.167
I do business in Hong Kong.

01:07:59.292 --> 01:08:02.084
I know the future lies in real estate.

01:08:02.292 --> 01:08:04.292
And the most important
thing for real estate is

01:08:04.459 --> 01:08:07.709
location, location, location.

01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:11.334
Your karaoke bar has the perfect location.

01:08:11.834 --> 01:08:13.542
What's "location"?

01:08:16.584 --> 01:08:17.542
Geographical position.

01:08:19.084 --> 01:08:20.501
Lang, you're so smart.

01:08:20.834 --> 01:08:23.001
I'm gonna make sure my son
busts his ass studying.

01:08:25.459 --> 01:08:29.042
Luo Li was a disappointment.

01:08:29.251 --> 01:08:30.626
Come work for me,

01:08:30.834 --> 01:08:32.334
Once my project is done,

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:36.334
I'll give everyone in your gang two houses.

01:08:36.584 --> 01:08:37.584
Seriously?

01:08:37.667 --> 01:08:39.167
You wanna bribe us?

01:08:39.542 --> 01:08:40.626
Who do you think we are?

01:08:41.167 --> 01:08:43.001
We are men of honor.

01:08:43.626 --> 01:08:46.626
My friend, who are you

01:08:46.876 --> 01:08:48.542
to talk to me about honor?

01:08:48.751 --> 01:08:50.709
Just take the offer.

01:08:51.001 --> 01:08:54.209
You'll realize in ten years that

01:08:54.251 --> 01:08:56.334
you made the right decision for them.

01:08:57.042 --> 01:09:00.084
In ten years,
a couple of houses won't mean shit!

01:09:00.417 --> 01:09:01.584
Isn't that right, Lang?

01:09:01.667 --> 01:09:02.501
Not exactly.

01:09:04.126 --> 01:09:04.751
Hello

01:09:05.542 --> 01:09:07.334
You got the balls to turn around?

01:09:18.417 --> 01:09:19.292
You got the balls to open your eyes?

01:09:19.334 --> 01:09:21.501
My eyes are wide fucking open.

01:09:24.126 --> 01:09:28.626
Seems like the only right thing
to come out of your mouth is your spit.

01:09:28.959 --> 01:09:30.501
Boss, what should we do?

01:09:34.126 --> 01:09:36.376
I tried to reason with you.

01:09:37.251 --> 01:09:39.042
Not anymore.

01:09:39.459 --> 01:09:40.417
Break their legs.

01:09:40.501 --> 01:09:42.084
Zheng!

01:09:42.251 --> 01:09:42.876
Zheng!

01:09:44.792 --> 01:09:46.375
Lang...

01:09:48.167 --> 01:09:48.834
Lang...

01:09:49.792 --> 01:09:50.459
Lang...

01:09:52.167 --> 01:09:53.167
Lang...

01:10:00.751 --> 01:10:02.167
Dad...

01:10:07.959 --> 01:10:09.250
What would I do

01:10:09.251 --> 01:10:10.209
if something happened to you two?

01:10:10.376 --> 01:10:11.501
Don't worry.

01:10:11.667 --> 01:10:13.917
We're both really good at fighting!

01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:16.001
It's just this time we were tied up!

01:10:16.292 --> 01:10:16.834
Honey,

01:10:16.917 --> 01:10:18.876
Give me one good reason
not to take revenge.

01:10:19.042 --> 01:10:20.001
Just one.

01:10:21.084 --> 01:10:22.084
I'm pregnant.

01:10:23.834 --> 01:10:24.709
Good enough?

01:10:25.001 --> 01:10:25.917
Yes!

01:10:28.251 --> 01:10:30.001
Yes, yes...

01:10:33.042 --> 01:10:34.001
Honey...

01:10:37.792 --> 01:10:39.292
Holy shit!

01:10:40.167 --> 01:10:40.959
You're pregnant..

01:10:41.376 --> 01:10:43.126
Just admit defeat this time.

01:10:43.542 --> 01:10:45.167
Don't fight any more.

01:10:45.251 --> 01:10:45.959
Okay.

01:10:46.209 --> 01:10:48.042
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

01:10:48.084 --> 01:10:49.042
Lang,

01:10:51.042 --> 01:10:52.251
What the fuck?

01:10:53.292 --> 01:10:54.917
Sorry... I...

01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:56.792
You're acting like you're the father.

01:10:57.042 --> 01:10:58.251
No, no.

01:10:58.501 --> 01:10:59.501
You're stealing all my moves.

01:10:59.501 --> 01:11:00.501
Now what should I do?

01:11:02.917 --> 01:11:05.042
Do you think it's a boy or a girl?

01:11:05.376 --> 01:11:06.292
Honey...

01:11:06.959 --> 01:11:07.501
I think...

01:11:07.542 --> 01:11:08.292
A boy!

01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:11.459
A boy!

01:11:11.542 --> 01:11:15.126
Can't you just let me have this moment?

01:11:15.459 --> 01:11:16.209
Go on.

01:11:16.667 --> 01:11:17.917
I think it's a girl.

01:11:18.042 --> 01:11:19.334
A girl just like you.

01:11:19.376 --> 01:11:20.751
If it's a boy, I'll kick him every day.

01:11:24.334 --> 01:11:25.917
Now what is it?

01:11:26.959 --> 01:11:27.792
What's wrong, Liu Yi?

01:11:28.209 --> 01:11:29.376
Ma's gone.

01:11:29.459 --> 01:11:30.501
He left us a letter.

01:11:31.334 --> 01:11:32.334
Read it.

01:11:34.584 --> 01:11:37.459
My dearest Zhengtai,

01:11:38.626 --> 01:11:41.417
Liu Yi, Hua, and Lang...

01:11:44.251 --> 01:11:46.667
If you're reading this,

01:11:47.167 --> 01:11:49.834
I'm already gone...

01:11:49.917 --> 01:11:51.334
Gone?

01:11:51.584 --> 01:11:52.584
Is he dead?

01:11:54.792 --> 01:11:57.084
The rest has been washed away by the rain.

01:12:00.876 --> 01:12:03.126
<i>If you're reading this,</i>

01:12:04.084 --> 01:12:05.959
<i>I'm already gone.</i>

01:12:07.667 --> 01:12:09.751
<i>I'm trying my luck down south.</i>

01:12:11.459 --> 01:12:14.167
<i>Thank you all for
looking after me this past year.</i>

01:12:15.334 --> 01:12:19.251
<i>But I've realized that my interests
are quite different than yours.</i>

01:12:20.959 --> 01:12:23.626
<i>And I've found it difficult to
fit in with the gang.</i>

01:12:24.751 --> 01:12:26.251
<i>Someone like me</i>

01:12:27.001 --> 01:12:28.292
<i>would just drag you down.</i>

01:12:30.834 --> 01:12:32.001
<i>To be honest,</i>

01:12:34.292 --> 01:12:36.501
<i>I don't know what the future will be bring.</i>

01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:40.542
<i>But I know I don't want to be
a typist or projectionist.</i>

01:12:41.709 --> 01:12:46.459
<i>I've always felt like
something bigger awaits me.</i>

01:12:48.084 --> 01:12:49.501
<i>My friends...</i>

01:12:50.917 --> 01:12:52.251
<i>Farewell.</i>

01:12:52.667 --> 01:12:54.167
<i>Write to me in the future...</i>

01:12:54.417 --> 01:12:58.417

Is it about to start?

01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:05.751
They're scarfing down the food.

01:15:08.334 --> 01:15:10.084
Maybe for the guests,

01:15:10.459 --> 01:15:13.084
the all-you-can-eat buffet

01:15:13.292 --> 01:15:15.542
really was ahead of its time.

01:15:16.334 --> 01:15:18.334
Well that was your great idea.

01:15:21.334 --> 01:15:22.626
Why is Liu Yi still not here?

01:15:23.417 --> 01:15:24.751
Not sure.

01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:29.792
How about this?

01:15:30.042 --> 01:15:31.251
I'll get up there

01:15:31.876 --> 01:15:33.542
and try to stall for time.

01:15:36.042 --> 01:15:36.959
Looking sharp!

01:16:22.209 --> 01:16:23.626
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:16:23.751 --> 01:16:25.001
Friends and family!

01:16:25.501 --> 01:16:26.709
Thank you for coming to

01:16:26.751 --> 01:16:29.584
Zheng and Hua's wedding.

01:16:30.001 --> 01:16:32.292
Today will be the most unforgettable day

01:16:33.334 --> 01:16:34.917
of my entire life.

01:16:35.751 --> 01:16:37.834
It will also probably be
the most unforgettable day

01:16:38.084 --> 01:16:39.501
of my other life.

01:16:40.209 --> 01:16:41.167
I never imagined

01:16:41.209 --> 01:16:43.834
I could personally bear
witness to their love.

01:16:45.126 --> 01:16:46.584
Don't smudge my makeup!

01:16:47.626 --> 01:16:48.751
Zheng...

01:16:49.876 --> 01:16:51.876
I used to hate him more than anything.

01:16:52.876 --> 01:16:54.376
But now he's my closest friend.

01:16:55.459 --> 01:16:56.542
It's our day.

01:16:56.626 --> 01:16:58.626
Why is he making this all about himself?

01:16:59.167 --> 01:17:01.209
Get used to it. That's just who he is.

01:17:03.001 --> 01:17:04.167
Hua...

01:17:08.334 --> 01:17:10.376
She's the most beautiful woman

01:17:11.001 --> 01:17:12.417
in this entire world.

01:17:14.167 --> 01:17:15.834
I never imagined

01:17:15.876 --> 01:17:17.042
I could...

01:17:19.251 --> 01:17:21.042
I could have the chance

01:17:22.584 --> 01:17:24.917
to look at her with my own eyes.

01:17:28.876 --> 01:17:29.959
A woman...

01:17:32.126 --> 01:17:33.376
A woman who's blurry...

01:17:33.417 --> 01:17:35.042
in all my photos...

01:17:36.834 --> 01:17:37.667
But today...

01:17:38.334 --> 01:17:41.167
She stands in front of me so clearly.

01:17:45.001 --> 01:17:47.584
Who knows what the future will bring?

01:17:48.584 --> 01:17:49.584
So Zheng...

01:17:49.626 --> 01:17:51.834
Cherish Hua...

01:17:52.584 --> 01:17:54.501
Every second, every minute...

01:17:55.001 --> 01:17:56.126
Every day.

01:17:59.126 --> 01:18:00.709
Life is a dream.

01:18:01.876 --> 01:18:03.626
A flash of lightning.

01:18:04.001 --> 01:18:05.667
What's in this area around here?

01:18:05.709 --> 01:18:06.626
This part.

01:18:06.876 --> 01:18:08.792
Is the contract ready?

01:18:14.292 --> 01:18:16.001
Go save that window cleaner.

01:18:22.292 --> 01:18:23.376
Liu Yi?

01:18:24.251 --> 01:18:26.542
Go through my secretary
if you wanna make an appointment.

01:18:26.876 --> 01:18:28.417
What are you doing?

01:18:33.376 --> 01:18:34.084
Your men

01:18:34.126 --> 01:18:35.667
broke my boss's leg.

01:18:35.834 --> 01:18:36.626
Remember?

01:18:36.667 --> 01:18:37.542
Of course.

01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:40.834
Today is his wedding day.

01:18:41.084 --> 01:18:41.792
Either

01:18:41.959 --> 01:18:43.209
I take a leg of yours...

01:18:43.626 --> 01:18:44.251
Or...

01:18:44.292 --> 01:18:46.001
You come with me to beg

01:18:46.126 --> 01:18:46.709
for his forgiveness.

01:18:46.917 --> 01:18:48.001
Liu Yi...

01:18:49.001 --> 01:18:49.917
You should leave.

01:18:50.251 --> 01:18:51.501
You're...

01:18:51.876 --> 01:18:52.959
Not a bad guy.

01:18:53.376 --> 01:18:54.376
Just dumb.

01:18:57.167 --> 01:18:58.417
Huang Zhiqiang!

01:18:59.209 --> 01:19:00.417
Today your leg

01:19:00.501 --> 01:19:01.542
will be my wedding gift!

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:09.542
Mr. Qiao...

01:19:10.459 --> 01:19:11.334
This...

01:19:11.376 --> 01:19:13.126
counts as justified self-defense, right?

01:19:13.376 --> 01:19:14.251
Of course.

01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:19.542
Music!

01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:29.501
Before we get married

01:19:30.126 --> 01:19:32.126
There's something I want to say

01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:34.251
Perhaps these words

01:19:35.292 --> 01:19:37.042
Will be difficult to hear

01:19:37.959 --> 01:19:39.709
Still you should listen

01:19:40.501 --> 01:19:42.292
Listen to what's in my heart

01:19:43.167 --> 01:19:44.959
Still listen carefully

01:19:45.792 --> 01:19:47.667
Listen to what's in my heart

01:19:48.417 --> 01:19:50.251
Every single night

01:19:51.042 --> 01:19:52.626
Don't sleep before me

01:20:05.292 --> 01:20:08.042
You bastard...

01:20:09.167 --> 01:20:12.626
These eyes will be watching
you from the grave...

01:20:14.626 --> 01:20:18.501
Don't you forget

01:20:19.167 --> 01:20:23.667
I haven't accomplished anything in my life

01:20:24.251 --> 01:20:28.667
It's all on you, it's all on you

01:20:28.834 --> 01:20:34.709
It's all on you, it's all on you.

01:20:43.876 --> 01:20:46.126
Guess I'll hide out in Hong Kong again.

01:21:38.042 --> 01:21:41.584
I'm gonna be the richest
out of all you guys.

01:23:20.042 --> 01:23:21.084
Zheng!

01:23:22.501 --> 01:23:23.501
This one's faster.

01:23:25.001 --> 01:23:25.876
Whatever.

01:23:26.042 --> 01:23:27.251
I'll drive.

01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:28.417
Let me.

01:23:28.626 --> 01:23:29.501
Your leg's broken.

01:23:30.001 --> 01:23:31.126
Fine. You drive.

01:23:31.459 --> 01:23:32.917
I'll be your co-driver.

01:23:36.751 --> 01:23:37.792
Where's the key?

01:23:38.876 --> 01:23:39.876
Should be here.

01:23:56.292 --> 01:23:58.417
This is Huang's location.

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:00.251
Go.

01:24:00.792 --> 01:24:02.584
Get him before he goes to Hong Kong.

01:24:08.751 --> 01:24:10.126
Alright, we'll take care of him.

01:24:11.792 --> 01:24:13.292
We're all nobodies.

01:24:13.584 --> 01:24:15.209
Don't be heroes.

01:24:17.626 --> 01:24:18.626
Just stay alive.

01:24:19.584 --> 01:24:20.501
Thanks.

01:24:40.167 --> 01:24:41.084
Take a right there.

01:24:59.292 --> 01:25:00.001
Left.

01:25:00.126 --> 01:25:01.042
Nope, turn right.

01:25:11.042 --> 01:25:12.917
How'd you do that?

01:25:48.542 --> 01:25:49.751
You just don't give up.

01:26:29.167 --> 01:26:29.792
Go.

01:26:51.292 --> 01:26:52.501
Huang Zhiqiang!

01:27:33.501 --> 01:27:34.126
Get them!

01:28:58.542 --> 01:28:59.542
Zheng!

01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:00.709
Zheng!

01:29:21.334 --> 01:29:22.751
It fuckin' hurts...

01:29:23.959 --> 01:29:25.209
I'm gonna die...

01:29:25.959 --> 01:29:27.584
You'll survive.

01:29:30.751 --> 01:29:31.876
Even if I do,

01:29:31.917 --> 01:29:34.084
I'll have to spend some time in jail.

01:29:36.459 --> 01:29:37.584
Six years.

01:29:41.084 --> 01:29:42.376
Zheng!

01:29:43.417 --> 01:29:44.459
Hua...

01:29:44.751 --> 01:29:45.542
Hua...

01:29:46.542 --> 01:29:47.251
Lang!

01:29:47.709 --> 01:29:48.792
What happened to you two?

01:29:48.834 --> 01:29:49.709
Sorry.

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:51.042
Honey, listen.

01:29:51.834 --> 01:29:52.209
I...

01:29:52.251 --> 01:29:53.959
I've prepared some stuff for our kid.

01:29:54.084 --> 01:29:54.917
They're in

01:29:54.959 --> 01:29:56.667
the chest by your bed.

01:29:57.417 --> 01:29:58.251
Listen to me.

01:29:58.292 --> 01:29:59.501
In the future,

01:29:59.584 --> 01:30:01.542
they'll be worth a fortune.

01:30:03.334 --> 01:30:05.251
You can't say I was good-for-nothing.

01:30:05.626 --> 01:30:06.417
Lang,

01:30:09.751 --> 01:30:11.334
While I'm in jail...

01:30:12.209 --> 01:30:14.959
Take care of my wife and kid.

01:30:16.459 --> 01:30:17.709
Actually...

01:30:18.584 --> 01:30:20.459
Don't take care of my wife.

01:30:22.501 --> 01:30:24.042
Treat my kid as your own.

01:30:24.334 --> 01:30:24.876
No,

01:30:24.917 --> 01:30:26.376
I can't do that.

01:30:26.876 --> 01:30:28.001
Enough.

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:49.876
Hereby is the verdict,

01:30:50.209 --> 01:30:52.126
Defendant Xu Tailang

01:30:52.251 --> 01:30:53.792
committed the crime of intentional injury

01:30:54.001 --> 01:30:56.167
and sentenced him to a fixed-term
imprisonment of 6 years

01:30:57.376 --> 01:30:58.459
Xu Zhengtai.

01:30:58.792 --> 01:30:59.792
Not bad, huh?

01:31:18.751 --> 01:31:19.584
In the future,

01:31:19.626 --> 01:31:22.584
we could be like Du Yuesheng.

01:31:32.751 --> 01:31:34.626
It's normal for businesses to go under.

01:31:35.167 --> 01:31:37.501
Don't be sad, I'll take care of you!

01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:43.792
Dad...

01:33:26.501 --> 01:33:27.626
Lang...

01:33:28.501 --> 01:33:30.709
You really drive like a pro.

01:33:31.251 --> 01:33:32.626
You're not so bad yourself.

01:33:33.667 --> 01:33:35.209
I was born to drive.

01:33:36.959 --> 01:33:38.751
What about you?

01:33:40.417 --> 01:33:41.709
I got it from my dad.

01:34:15.251 --> 01:34:16.667
What's all this for?

01:34:16.959 --> 01:34:19.251
Just wait, there's something
I wanna show you.

01:34:31.501 --> 01:34:33.917
Honey, come on out!

01:34:45.667 --> 01:34:47.751
Madame Hua...

01:34:59.001 --> 01:35:00.667
Let me introduce to you.

01:35:00.917 --> 01:35:03.084
This is Lang. Please say hello.

01:35:03.292 --> 01:35:04.959
Hello, Lang...

01:35:06.584 --> 01:35:07.959
And this...

01:35:08.126 --> 01:35:10.251
is my man Xu Zhengtai.

01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:12.376
You all know him.

01:35:13.334 --> 01:35:15.542
I wanted to tell everyone today...

01:35:16.001 --> 01:35:17.084
We're getting married.

01:35:19.209 --> 01:35:20.251
Thank you.

01:35:22.751 --> 01:35:24.667
Get back to work now.

01:35:24.792 --> 01:35:25.917
Now you go back to work.

01:35:29.959 --> 01:35:30.542
Lang,

01:35:30.584 --> 01:35:32.251
This is Hua's job.

01:35:32.667 --> 01:35:34.334
She's like the mommy here.

01:35:34.792 --> 01:35:36.501
You had no idea, right?

01:35:37.251 --> 01:35:38.626
Call her mommy.

01:35:44.792 --> 01:35:46.042
Mother...

01:35:51.751 --> 01:35:53.417
Hey, Lang...

01:35:56.292 --> 01:35:57.167
Lang!

01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:58.334
Lang!

01:35:58.417 --> 01:36:01.334
That's enough!

01:36:01.376 --> 01:36:03.126
Lang!
