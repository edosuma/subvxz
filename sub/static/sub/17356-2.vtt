00:07.508 --> 00:10.509
- ¶

00:10.511 --> 00:12.111
- Chloe, breakfast!

00:12.113 --> 00:13.512
- CHLOE:
[whooshes]

00:13.514 --> 00:16.315
Thunder Baby,
reporting for duty.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.217
- Aw, Chloe,
you look so cute.

00:18.219 --> 00:22.721
- I'm not cute. I'm
a villain's worst nightmare.

00:23.624 --> 00:24.490
- Well, cute or not,

00:24.492 --> 00:27.226
you still can't wear your
supersuit to preschool.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.695
- Why not? Everyone knows
we're superheroes.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.330
- Yeah, everything's
different now.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.098
Last week Max was
an evil villain.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.034
Now he's a superhero--

00:35.036 --> 00:37.202
who just stole my bacon.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.571
- I just saved the world
from watching

00:39.573 --> 00:41.206
the weird way you eat bacon.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.175
- Okay, it is not weird.

00:43.177 --> 00:46.211
[imitates machine
chomping bacon]

00:46.213 --> 00:48.380
- I'll tell you what
else is different.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.315
- We get up when
we speak now?

00:50.317 --> 00:52.418
This changes everything!

00:52.420 --> 00:53.285
- No, look at your phone.

00:53.287 --> 00:56.622
We both have fan pages
with tons of followers.

00:56.624 --> 00:57.623
- You know, in my prime,

00:57.625 --> 01:00.726
my fan club had over
a thousand Thunder Fans.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.328
- I have a quarter million!

01:03.330 --> 01:05.497
- No eggs for you.

01:07.068 --> 01:11.503
- Let's please all remember this
is family breakfast time.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.371
- Mom's right.

01:12.373 --> 01:15.107
We should send our fans pictures
of the family breakfast.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.175
- HANK: No.
- [phone cameras click]

01:16.177 --> 01:18.310
- Your mom means we shouldn't
let being exposed

01:18.312 --> 01:22.247
prevent us from living
perfectly normal lives.

01:22.249 --> 01:22.848
- This just in--

01:22.850 --> 01:25.751
the Thundermans are determined
to live perfectly normal lives.

01:25.753 --> 01:29.521
Next up, are you eating
bacon the right way?

01:29.523 --> 01:32.391
- BARB & HANK:
Get out!

01:32.393 --> 01:35.594
- ¶

01:35.596 --> 01:37.362
- And then I flipped
him with my TK.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.798
That's superhero
for telekinesis.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.434
Then I blasted him
with my freeze breath,

01:42.436 --> 01:44.403
and that's superhero for..

01:44.405 --> 01:46.271
freeze breath.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.173
[frosty air blowing]

01:48.175 --> 01:49.141
- ALL:
[gasping]

01:49.143 --> 01:50.142
- Guys, what's going on?

01:50.144 --> 01:52.311
- That's your sister.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.279
- Yes, I know that.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.180
What's she doing?

01:55.182 --> 01:56.682
- She's telling everyone
about her latest save.

01:56.684 --> 02:00.686
Did you know she has
telekinesis and freeze breath?

02:00.688 --> 02:02.654
- So do I!

02:02.823 --> 02:05.624
- Yeah, I don't
think so, bro.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.161
- Well, if they
like her stories,

02:09.163 --> 02:10.329
they're gonna love mine.

02:10.331 --> 02:13.665
Excuse me! Pardon me!
Hero comin' through!

02:13.667 --> 02:14.533
So, there I was...

02:14.535 --> 02:18.570
face-to-face with history's
greatest villain Dark Mayhem.

02:18.572 --> 02:19.872
- Wait, weren't you working
for Dark Mayhem?

02:19.874 --> 02:22.441
- Haven't you only been
good for like a week?

02:22.443 --> 02:25.711
- Are you using
a new moisturizer?

02:25.713 --> 02:27.713
- Do you wanna hear
the story or not?

02:27.715 --> 02:29.581
- [bell rings]

02:29.583 --> 02:31.450
- Wait! Hey, come back!

02:31.452 --> 02:32.351
It is a new moisturizer,

02:32.353 --> 02:34.620
and I'm just as good
a superhero as Phoebe.

02:34.622 --> 02:37.422
- Whoa! Let's not get
carried away.

02:37.424 --> 02:39.358
I've been training my whole
life to be a superhero,

02:39.360 --> 02:42.361
while you've been training
to be a super villain?

02:42.363 --> 02:43.262
- That was a phase.

02:43.264 --> 02:46.231
I tried to tell you guys.
No one would listen to me.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.333
You seriously don't
think I'm as good as you?

02:48.335 --> 02:50.202
- Well, how do I put this?

02:50.204 --> 02:51.336
No.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.939
Max, being a superhero
isn't just about power.

02:53.941 --> 02:57.309
It's about training,
experience.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.911
Seriously, what moisturizer
are you using?

02:58.913 --> 03:00.746
You are just glowing.

03:00.748 --> 03:04.750
- I'll never tell that it's
lavender body butter.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.852
Dang it!

03:06.854 --> 03:07.686
- I'll tell you what.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.655
Why don't I take you out on
a few training missions,

03:09.657 --> 03:10.789
show you the ropes?

03:10.791 --> 03:13.825
- Keep your ropes.
I've got a mission right here.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.327
I bet you didn't even
notice the janitor

03:15.329 --> 03:18.897
with the "VL" necklace,
as in "Villain League."

03:18.899 --> 03:21.667
He's clearly here
to take us down.

03:21.669 --> 03:22.467
Watch how I work.

03:22.469 --> 03:23.735
- Wait, wait, wait, Max.
No, don't--

03:23.737 --> 03:25.370
- [powers whooshing]
- JANITOR: Oh!

03:25.372 --> 03:26.338
- MAX:
Ha, ha, ha!

03:26.340 --> 03:29.208
Now let's see what's in your
little cart of villainy.

03:29.210 --> 03:29.975
A-a--a...

03:29.977 --> 03:32.511
toilet plunger?

03:32.513 --> 03:34.379
- Whew, that was close.

03:34.381 --> 03:37.449
You thwarted his evil
plan to unclog toilets.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.884
- Well, what does
"VL" stand for?

03:38.886 --> 03:42.854
- Vladimir Lushenko
is very angry with you!

03:45.926 --> 03:47.526
- Due to a change
in circumstances,

03:47.528 --> 03:51.363
I'd like you to show
me those ropes, please.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.533

04:30.771 --> 04:32.738
- What's wrong? Is it serious?
- Yes!

04:32.740 --> 04:36.008
Could you open
this pickle jar?

04:36.710 --> 04:38.844
- [lid "pops"]

04:39.980 --> 04:41.346
- [door slams]

04:41.348 --> 04:42.681
- Ever since we were exposed,

04:42.683 --> 04:43.982
our neighbors keep asking me

04:43.984 --> 04:46.618
to use my superpowers for
the slightest things.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.454
- Gee, I have no idea
what that's like.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.923
[powers zapping steak]

04:54.795 --> 04:58.463
Here's your steak,
Mr. Walters.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.367
- [whooshing]
Will you guys draw with me?

05:02.369 --> 05:04.336
- Sorry, Chloe, but we're
in the middle of

05:04.338 --> 05:06.071
a live chat with our fans.

05:06.073 --> 05:06.938
- Live chat with me.

05:06.940 --> 05:11.476
- We'd love to, but you're
not really trending right now.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.644
- [huffing]

05:12.646 --> 05:14.446
- Just play with your sister.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.982
- Yeah, I know being
famous is exciting,

05:16.984 --> 05:19.351
but in this house,
family comes first.

05:19.353 --> 05:22.487
- Chloe, would you rather
we played with you now

05:22.489 --> 05:25.691
or play unicorn tea party
with you tomorrow morning?

05:25.693 --> 05:28.894
- Unicorn tea party!
[whooshing]

05:28.896 --> 05:31.396
- Guys, that was not okay.

05:31.398 --> 05:32.497
- He's right, Billy.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.333
We could give you
a quick apology now,

05:34.335 --> 05:36.968
or a heartfelt one
tomorrow morning.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.037
- Oh, I guess
tomorrow morning.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.039
- BARB: [silently]
No.

05:41.041 --> 05:41.973
- Great.

05:41.975 --> 05:42.708
Come on, Billy.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.911
We promised the fans that we'd
show them your webbed toe.

05:45.913 --> 05:46.645
- Bye, Mom and Dad.

Taking Max out on patrol to
teach him how to be a superhero.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.616
- I know how
to be a superhero.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.352
Now does anyone
have a spare cape?

05:53.354 --> 05:55.387
I shrank mine in the wash.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.022
- HANK: [silently]
Oh.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.524
- Bye, guys. Don't wait up.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.060
- NORA:
What is that?

06:02.062 --> 06:05.530
- Sorry. Sometimes stuff
gets caught in my web.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.798
- No, look.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.533
- Hank, is that what
I think it is?

06:08.535 --> 06:10.035
- A message from
the Z Force.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.037
- MALE VOICE: Congratulations,
Phoebe Thunderman.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.740
You are a finalist for
the newly-opened slot

06:14.742 --> 06:16.441
on the legendary Z Force.
- PHOEBE: [gasps]

06:16.443 --> 06:18.710
- We'll be watching you
over the coming weeks

06:18.712 --> 06:20.479
as we make our decision.

06:20.481 --> 06:21.079
Good luck!

06:21.081 --> 06:22.447
- Oh, my gosh,
I can't believe

06:22.449 --> 06:24.049
I'm being considered for
a slot in the Z Force!

06:24.051 --> 06:27.552
- I know! It's amazing!
What's the Z Force?

06:27.554 --> 06:30.489
- They're the most elite
superheroes in the Hero League.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.558
They get the assignments
no one else can handle.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.993
- Yeah, they're who
the superheroes call

06:34.995 --> 06:36.094
when they need saving.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.096
- Oh, like that time
Dad got his cape stuck

06:38.098 --> 06:39.631
on the Statue of Liberty.

06:39.633 --> 06:43.835
- Ohhhhh!
This is Phoebe's moment.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.036
- Well, it makes sense.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.772
You're the protector
of Hiddenville,

06:46.774 --> 06:48.440
you defeated King Crab,

06:48.442 --> 06:49.474
you helped save the prom.

06:49.476 --> 06:52.110
Somebody raised ya right!
- HANK: [laughs]

06:52.112 --> 06:54.179
It's time to celebrate.

I'll get the ice cream cake.

07:02.122 --> 07:02.721

07:02.723 --> 07:05.524
- Yeah, pretty cool.
Now let's go.

07:05.692 --> 07:08.460
- Aw, you still think
we're doin' that?

07:08.462 --> 07:09.528
- Yeah. Why not?

07:09.530 --> 07:10.328
- The Z Force is watching.

07:10.330 --> 07:14.032
I can't risk you making
a rookie mistake on my patrol.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.000
No offense.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.936
- Uh...lots of offense.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.138
What makes you think I'd
make a rookie mistake?

07:20.140 --> 07:21.640
- Max, you make
the janitor quit.

07:21.642 --> 07:24.476
Every toilet in
the school is backed up.

07:24.478 --> 07:27.946
- Max, I'm taking Chloe to
the playground tomorrow.

07:27.948 --> 07:31.483
Maybe I can help train
you by the monkey bars.

07:31.485 --> 07:34.119
- Keep your monkey bars.
I'm not a child.

07:34.121 --> 07:38.089
Now get outta my way
so I can go on my slide!

07:45.899 --> 07:47.933

¶ You got ditched
by Phoebe ¶

07:51.638 --> 07:52.270
- It's not funny.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.638
And how'd you even
hear that?

07:53.640 --> 07:55.740
- Rabbits have
remarkable hearing.

07:55.742 --> 07:59.611
Plus, I attached a transmitter
under your armpit.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.779
- [transmitter beeping]

08:00.781 --> 08:01.913
- Colosso, we talked
about this.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.748
Keep your paws
outta my pits.

08:03.750 --> 08:06.084
- Don't you see
what's happening, Max?

08:06.086 --> 08:09.921
The universe is telling you to
come back to the dark side.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.190
- No, Colosso.
I'm not evil anymore.

08:12.192 --> 08:16.127
- Well, maybe this
will change your mind.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.029
- The Brainwash XL?
[laughs]

08:18.031 --> 08:22.033
I used that to make Principal
Bradford think he could fly.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.201
He could not.

08:23.203 --> 08:27.038
- Now you can use it to turn
everyone in Hiddenville

08:27.040 --> 08:28.540
into your own private army.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.775
- I thought I put all
my evil gadgets in storage.

08:30.777 --> 08:34.212
- Well, maybe I hid this
somewhere you'd never guess.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.780
- The bottom drawer?

08:35.782 --> 08:38.149
- Wow, that is a good guess.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.852
- I'm throwing this away
without touching it.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.854
- [powers whooshing]

08:42.856 --> 08:43.989
- [garbage can clanks]

08:43.991 --> 08:45.991
- Is this because
I bugged your pits?

08:45.993 --> 08:48.226
Because it was no picnic
for me, either.

08:48.228 --> 08:53.231
- No, Colosso, it's because
I am a superhero now.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.935
- Phoebe thinks
you're a superzero.

08:56.937 --> 08:57.936
- Everybody does--

08:57.938 --> 08:59.104
which is why I'm
gonna prove to them

08:59.106 --> 09:04.743
that I am an amazing superzero,
zuperhero, herozero.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.211
- You can't even say it.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.748
- I don't have to say it.
I'm gonna show it.

09:12.152 --> 09:15.320
- Well, at least I can listen
to the "Hank & Barb Show."

09:15.322 --> 09:19.090
- BARB: Hank, when are you gonna
fix those holes in the ceiling,

09:19.092 --> 09:23.228
and why is your armpit blinking?
- COLOSSO: [chuckling]

09:23.230 --> 09:26.064
Good stuff!
[chuckling]

09:26.266 --> 09:31.336
- My wrists are sore from
autographing all these bows.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.105
- BILLY:
[zooming]

09:34.107 --> 09:35.740
Your wrists are sore?

09:35.742 --> 09:39.277
I just accepted 43,000
friend requests.

09:39.279 --> 09:44.983
- Hey, this unicorn tea party
isn't gonna have itself.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.885
- Oh, no, I totally forgot.

09:46.887 --> 09:50.221
Sorry, Chloe, we'll just
have to do it later.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.258
- Our fans need us.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.628
- But I made so much
pretend tea.

09:56.630 --> 10:01.333
- Forget it, Chloe.
They're obviously not coming.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.639
- I feel bad for her,
but there's just not enough time

10:07.641 --> 10:10.775
to respond to all our fans.

10:10.777 --> 10:11.943
- Unless...

10:11.945 --> 10:13.678
we gather all of
our fans in one place.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.281
We could greet them
all at the same time.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.315
Like a convention.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.851
We could call it
"ThunderCon."

10:19.853 --> 10:21.052
- Billy, that's brilliant!

10:21.054 --> 10:24.789
Why don't you come up with
ideas like this all the time?

10:24.791 --> 10:26.992
- Ow! Brain pain!

10:26.994 --> 10:30.128
- I'll send a ThunderCon
invite to our fans.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.062
- I don't think so.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.198
- Chloe just said
you ditched her again,

10:33.200 --> 10:36.801
and now you're planning
some sort of ThunderCon?

10:36.803 --> 10:38.336
- We could get you
in at half price.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.805
- [gasps] Half price, Barb!
- Hank!

10:40.807 --> 10:41.673
- Uh, I mean, no!

10:41.675 --> 10:43.808
We warned you about putting
fame before family

10:43.810 --> 10:45.944
and you obviously
did not listen.

10:45.946 --> 10:46.945
- Yeah, no ThunderCon

10:46.947 --> 10:49.347
and no more chatting
with your fans.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.350
- Electress? A big fan.
- BARB: Oh?

10:52.352 --> 10:53.351
- Can you charge my tablet?

10:53.353 --> 10:54.753
- Okay, citizen,
but remember,

10:54.755 --> 10:58.657
you won't need my zaps
if you close your apps.

10:58.659 --> 11:01.960
[laughing]
[powers zapping]

11:04.031 --> 11:05.697
- What a bummer.
- I know.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.699
Especially since this
ThunderCon invite

11:07.701 --> 11:08.867
is all ready to go.

11:08.869 --> 11:14.005
It'd be a real "oopsie"
if someone sent it out.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.007
Oopsie!
- [phone "bloops"]

11:16.009 --> 11:18.009
- Technically,
that wasn't an "oopsie"

11:18.011 --> 11:20.345
because you did it on
purpose to deceive--

11:20.347 --> 11:23.114
Ow! Brain pain!

11:29.823 --> 11:31.723
- Oh, according to
"Supe!" magazine,

11:31.725 --> 11:35.326
this is the first opening on
the Z Force in nine years.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.862
- Oh, ho, ho, and our
little girl might get it!

11:37.864 --> 11:43.101
- Aw, come on, guys, we'll
have to "zee" if I get in.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.903
But it's quite "zee" honor.

11:44.905 --> 11:45.937
- HANK:
[laughing]

11:45.939 --> 11:47.872
- Yeah, I "zee" what
she did there.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.841
- BARB & HANK:
[laughing]

11:49.843 --> 11:52.444
- I have returned!

11:53.046 --> 11:54.879
- Hey, son, where ya been?

11:54.881 --> 11:58.049
- Just pullin' off one
of the most epic saves

11:58.051 --> 11:59.084
Hiddenville's ever seen.

11:59.086 --> 12:02.153
- Aw, baby's first saves.

12:02.155 --> 12:05.890
- Could a baby save
three hikers from a bear?

12:05.892 --> 12:10.161
Could a baby save students
on a runaway school bus?

12:10.163 --> 12:14.766
Could a baby save
an actual baby?

12:14.768 --> 12:15.900
His first words were,

12:15.902 --> 12:18.403
"You're my hero,
Max Thunderman."

12:18.405 --> 12:22.073
- Is that a Ricky's Sticky Buns
I saw in the background?

12:22.075 --> 12:24.776
- You know it is, big guy.

12:24.778 --> 12:27.912
- You're my hero,
Max Thunderman.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.781
- So, Phoebs,

12:29.783 --> 12:32.317
ready to admit I'm as
good a superhero as you?

12:32.319 --> 12:34.319
- I think you're
off to a great start.

12:34.321 --> 12:38.256
You saved some smelly hikers
and a clumsy baby.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.991
You still have
quite a way to go

12:39.993 --> 12:42.127
before anyone thinks
you're as good as me.

12:42.129 --> 12:42.861
- [whooshes, clunks]

12:42.863 --> 12:45.063
- MALE VOICE: Congratulations,
Max Thunderman.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.465
You are a finalist for
the newly-opened slot

12:47.467 --> 12:49.300
on the legendary Z Force.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.236
- BARB: [gasps]
- Good luck!

12:51.238 --> 12:54.372
- We're up for
the same slot.

12:54.808 --> 12:57.375
- This can't
"zee" happening.

13:02.415 --> 13:05.150
- ¶

13:05.152 --> 13:07.285
- Oh, you're both
being considered

13:07.287 --> 13:09.287
for the same Z Force slot.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.155
That's amazing!

13:10.157 --> 13:13.291
- I know. It's been
a dream of mine since...

13:13.293 --> 13:14.893
yesterday.

13:14.895 --> 13:18.029
- It's my dream!
Get outta my dream!

13:18.031 --> 13:22.433
- [quietly] Who are we rooting
for? I'm so confused.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.136
- Guys, this is crazy.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.771
Max has one lucky
night of saves

13:26.773 --> 13:27.472
and all of a sudden,

13:27.474 --> 13:28.940
he's being considered
for the Z Force?

13:28.942 --> 13:33.077
- Looks like someone's joining
the J Force--for jealousy.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.846
Am I right?
[laughs]

13:34.848 --> 13:36.815
- I am not jealous.
- You are so, jealous.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.751
- You don't have the training.
- BARB: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

13:39.753 --> 13:41.753
I know you're both vying
for the same spot,

13:41.755 --> 13:44.989
but you're still family
and family comes first.

Outta my way! Phoebe!
- No, I saw it first!

13:53.466 --> 13:54.499
Ow!

We're rooting for Phoebe?

Our fans love us.

dressed up like us, Nora.

14:09.816 --> 14:12.217

14:23.363 --> 14:25.530
And your breakfast pix.
Amazing!

14:25.532 --> 14:27.432
- You know, I actually
made that toast

14:27.434 --> 14:28.366
with my lasers.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.235
Check it out.
[lasers zapping]

- Oops. Sorry, Billy.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.106
- She lasered Billy!

14:35.108 --> 14:37.375
- It's cool, guys.
It happens all the time.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.243
- You hear that?

14:38.245 --> 14:40.178
Little Bow Creep
has zapped him before.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.281
- Hey, no one talks about
our queen like that!

14:43.283 --> 14:45.984
Right, Noranators?
- ALL: Right!

14:45.986 --> 14:48.253

lasers our king!

Wha-a-a-at am I saving?

15:10.877 --> 15:14.412
- Thank goodness,
the Thundermans will save us.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.548
The tube at table 7
is jammed.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.284

15:21.054 --> 15:23.554
It's the furthest
from the bathroom.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.356

you got it.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.292
No problem's too small
for a real hero.

15:27.294 --> 15:30.561

blabbing your mouth?

He's already on it.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.431

15:33.433 --> 15:35.600
loosen the clog
until it shoots out.

you stick to, uh,

15:38.004 --> 15:39.370

19:01.608 --> 19:04.542
- Did that just come
from your watch?

19:04.544 --> 19:05.376
- Uh, what watch?

19:05.378 --> 19:08.112
- --a finalist for
the newly-opened slot

19:08.114 --> 19:09.714
on the legendary Z Force.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.249
Good luck!

19:11.251 --> 19:13.584
- You faked your
Z Force message?

19:13.586 --> 19:15.119
They're no considering
you at all.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.755
- To be fair,
you guys fell for it.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.657
We all played our part.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.792
- [thunderous rumbling
continues]

19:21.794 --> 19:26.097
- We've gotta get outta here!
The place is gonna blow!

19:27.167 --> 19:30.568
- [massive explosion]

19:31.604 --> 19:35.406
- [debris thuds]
- [electrical zapping]

19:35.408 --> 19:37.308
- BOTH:
Whew!

19:37.310 --> 19:39.210
- Good thing everyone
made it out.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.646
- You're welcome,
Mrs. Wong.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.548
Wait, where's Mrs. Wong?

19:43.550 --> 19:48.286
- [coughing, sputtering]

19:48.288 --> 19:50.154
- Mrs. Wong,
are you okay?

19:50.156 --> 19:53.691
- Oh...come closer...

19:54.594 --> 19:56.727
closer...

19:57.263 --> 20:00.464
I hate you losers!

20:01.568 --> 20:04.535
[snarling]

20:04.537 --> 20:09.540
- ¶

20:09.542 --> 20:12.843
- Blowing up a restaurant?

20:13.580 --> 20:17.181
Causing a fan riot?

20:17.450 --> 20:20.585
And where, may I ask,
were you two?

20:20.587 --> 20:22.453
- Opening pickle jars, ma'am.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.488
- Grilling steaks, ma'am.

20:24.490 --> 20:29.193
- Well, since being exposed
has obviously prevented you

20:29.195 --> 20:31.495
from being effective
superheroes,

20:31.497 --> 20:33.197
there's only one
thing to do.

20:33.199 --> 20:33.931
- Never tell the Z Force

20:33.933 --> 20:37.868
and also don't
tell the Z Force?

20:37.870 --> 20:40.471
- Oh, I told the Z Force.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.340
I meant, I'm going to
have to relocate you

20:42.342 --> 20:44.875
somewhere where you
can be undercover again.

20:44.877 --> 20:45.910
- Wait, we have to move?

20:45.912 --> 20:48.746
- We're getting up
when we talk again?

20:48.748 --> 20:51.182
- Isn't moving
a little extreme?

20:51.184 --> 20:52.883
This town loves
the Thundermans.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.619
- PRESIDENT KICKBUTT:
[snaps fingers]

20:54.621 --> 20:57.888
- CROWD:
[angry shouting]

20:57.890 --> 21:01.592
- MAN: Where's Phoebe?
They said she was here!

21:01.594 --> 21:04.262
- [door slams]

21:04.264 --> 21:05.463
- Continue.

21:05.465 --> 21:09.500
- Beam in
the Wheel of Relocation.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.502
- [powers whooshing]

21:11.504 --> 21:14.739
- Well, that's a fun way
to ruin our lives.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.774
- What about my friends?
- What about Allison?

21:16.776 --> 21:20.678
- What about me?
I just learned our address.

21:21.648 --> 21:25.950
- I'm sorry, but superheroes
are supposed to save people,

21:25.952 --> 21:27.618
not endanger them.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.721
- You blew it, babies!

21:32.659 --> 21:35.926
- Hank, please
spin the wheel.

21:38.798 --> 21:45.636
- ¶

21:45.638 --> 21:46.704
- I can't believe this.

21:46.706 --> 21:49.940
Wherever it lands
will be our new home.

21:49.942 --> 21:54.011
- [dramatic music]
- [wheel clicking]

21:54.781 --> 22:06.557
- ¶

22:10.697 --> 22:14.465
- [dramatic music continues]
- [wheel clicking]

22:14.867 --> 22:15.766
- I'm so nervous.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.368
I wonder where
it's gonna stop?

22:17.370 --> 22:19.003
- Or when it's
going to stop.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.772
It's been spinning
for 15 hours.

22:23.810 --> 22:26.944
Did you have to spin
the wheel so hard, Thunder Man?

22:26.946 --> 22:30.481
- Hank has trouble controlling
his superstrength

22:30.483 --> 22:31.949
when he's emotional.

22:31.951 --> 22:35.653
- I do not!
- [object shatters]

22:36.723 --> 22:39.690
- We've played so many
fun games here.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.492
"Laser the Boy."
"Zap the Billy."

22:41.494 --> 22:45.029
"Hold still, Billy,
I'm going to zap you."

22:45.398 --> 22:46.764
- Do you wanna play
one last time?

22:46.766 --> 22:48.966
- NORA: [powers zapping]
- BILLY: Ow!

22:48.968 --> 22:50.801
Good times.

22:51.304 --> 22:53.304
- Chloe, why haven't
you packed yet?

22:53.306 --> 22:55.706
- 'Cause I can come
back whenever I want--

22:55.708 --> 22:57.375
with my powers.

22:57.377 --> 22:58.876
- I'm afraid not,
Small Thunder.

22:58.878 --> 23:02.446
If any of you defy my orders
and return to Hiddenville,

23:02.448 --> 23:05.716
I'll be forced to remove
your powers permanently.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.618
- Permanently?
- What?

23:07.620 --> 23:08.285
- Nice, Max.

23:08.287 --> 23:09.587
Not only did you ruin
the Z Force for me,

23:09.589 --> 23:10.821
now we're banned
from Hiddenville.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.456
- Hey, this is
all your fault.

23:12.458 --> 23:13.591
You should hear how angry

23:13.593 --> 23:15.292
Allison is at me
that I'm moving.

23:15.294 --> 23:18.629
- ALLISON:
[speed-chattering]

23:19.832 --> 23:20.398
[screams]

23:20.400 --> 23:23.501
- I know, I know.
I hate Phoebe, too.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.636
- It's gonna be so hard
saying goodbye to Cherry.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.738
I don't know when I'm
gonna see her again.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.473
- Surprise!

23:29.475 --> 23:33.577
Your new house looks just
like your old house.

23:33.579 --> 23:34.578
- Cherry...

23:34.580 --> 23:37.882
look, I know this is hard,
but you can't come with us.

23:37.884 --> 23:39.750
- Oh, Phoebe!

23:39.752 --> 23:40.785
We'll always be besties.

23:40.787 --> 23:44.488
Nothing will ever
take me away from you.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.090
- Take her away!

23:46.092 --> 23:48.025
- [powers whooshing]

23:48.027 --> 23:51.061
- You just sent
her home, right?

23:51.063 --> 23:53.497
- Oh, good.

23:53.499 --> 23:55.666
The new undercover
superhero family

23:55.668 --> 23:58.936
who'll be moving
in just pulled up.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.604
- Wait, you're giving
our house away?

24:00.606 --> 24:04.074
- Yes, the Hero League put
a lot of money into this place.

24:04.076 --> 24:05.810
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

24:05.812 --> 24:08.479
I cost $3 million.

24:10.983 --> 24:14.485
- Hi! We're the new,
normal, non-supe family

24:14.487 --> 24:16.654
moving into this house.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.757
- Secret maintained.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.025
Thunder Man!

24:21.027 --> 24:22.026
Nice to finally meet ya.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.695
I'm Falcon Man.
This is my wife, Iron Grip.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.464
- A pleasure to meet
you, Iron Gri--

24:26.466 --> 24:28.933
[bones crunching]

24:28.935 --> 24:30.568
- Nice place you got here.

24:30.570 --> 24:33.103
Come on, honey, let's see
if there's room upstairs

24:33.105 --> 24:35.873
for my "supernest."

24:36.843 --> 24:37.808
- That's strange.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.377
I wonder where
their daughter is?

24:40.379 --> 24:42.580
- Does anyone
smell bubble gum?

24:42.582 --> 24:44.515
- ALL:
[sniffing]

24:44.517 --> 24:46.083
- That's me!

24:46.085 --> 24:47.952
My name is Candi.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.954
Oh, what a lovely family.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.622
Who are these cuties?

24:51.624 --> 24:55.993
- Great, a girl finally thinks
I'm cute and we're moving.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.829
- I bet you guys
would like some treats.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.966
Hold out your hands.
[giggles]

25:01.968 --> 25:05.135
- [powers "popping"]

25:05.137 --> 25:07.438
- Cool! Candy powers.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.107
- Do you need a sidekick?
- Or a boyfriend?

25:10.109 --> 25:14.612
- Oh, aren't you the sweetest
little gooey gumdrops.

25:14.614 --> 25:15.112
[giggles]

25:15.114 --> 25:17.982
- Ugh, I officially
have a cavity.

25:17.984 --> 25:20.117
Going to get Colosso.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.852
- Hank:
[clearing throat]

25:21.854 --> 25:23.921
I did not get a gum ball.

25:23.923 --> 25:27.858
- Oh...
[giggles]

25:30.129 --> 25:33.597
- ¶

25:33.599 --> 25:35.165
- Colosso, you packed yet?

25:35.167 --> 25:36.000
What are you doing?

25:36.002 --> 25:37.868
- What I always do
when I'm depressed--

25:37.870 --> 25:40.738
buy something
I can't afford.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.907
- Quit foolin' around
and let's go.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.875
- Yeah, about that.

25:44.877 --> 25:45.976
No!

25:45.978 --> 25:47.511
If you insist
on being good,

25:47.513 --> 25:50.481
I insist on hating you
and staying here!

25:50.483 --> 25:51.782
- Just 'cause I'm good now

25:51.784 --> 25:53.851
doesn't mean we're
not best friends.

25:53.853 --> 25:56.787
- That's exactly
what it means.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.155
Good talk.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.124
- Wheeee!
[giggles]

26:00.126 --> 26:04.495
Oh, jumping jellybeans,
I love my new room.

26:04.497 --> 26:08.032
- You'd rather live here
with Wendy Wonka?

26:08.034 --> 26:11.702
- Anything's better
than you--traitor.

26:11.704 --> 26:15.573
- Oh, a talking bunny.
How adorable.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.875
- I'm not adorable, girlie.

26:17.877 --> 26:21.512
I'm the Fast
and the Furriest.

26:21.948 --> 26:26.817
- Well, I can see someone
has to learn their manners.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.185
- COLOSSO:
[gasps]

26:28.187 --> 26:32.156
- BARB: Come back upstairs, Max.
The wheel is slowing down.

26:32.158 --> 26:35.559
- Well, if you're really
not coming, Colosso,

26:35.561 --> 26:38.662
I guess this is good--
- [horn blaring]

26:38.664 --> 26:40.064
- Fine. Goodbye.

26:40.066 --> 26:42.533
- What?
- I said goodb--

26:42.535 --> 26:45.769
- [horn blaring]

26:49.542 --> 26:51.175
- Ah...

26:51.811 --> 26:54.912
- NORA: This is it.
Goodbye, house.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.814
- PHOEBE:
Goodbye, friends.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.115
- Goodbye, penguin.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.918
- BILLY:
Goodbye, Hiddenville.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.988
Hello...

27:05.224 --> 27:08.192
- ALL:
Antarctica?

27:13.299 --> 27:18.369
- ¶

27:18.371 --> 27:22.239
- There--all
the comforts of home.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.044
- Yeah? Well, at home,
I didn't have to eat

27:27.046 --> 27:30.681
my cereal like an ice pop.

27:30.683 --> 27:33.651
- Well, I'm lovin'
these pancakes.

27:33.653 --> 27:35.719
- [syrup cracking]

27:36.055 --> 27:38.656
Nope, they're frozen.

27:39.058 --> 27:41.358
- [wind howling]

27:43.095 --> 27:45.896
- [door slams]

27:47.133 --> 27:49.700
- How was patrol, honey?

27:49.702 --> 27:50.267
- Pointless!

27:50.269 --> 27:53.771
Unless you count breaking
up a seal fight as a "save."

27:53.773 --> 27:54.705
- [seals barking]

27:54.707 --> 27:57.775
- Don't make me come
back out there!

27:57.977 --> 28:00.277
- Yes, I was able to
super-charge the modem

28:00.279 --> 28:01.278
and give us internet!

28:01.280 --> 28:05.816
Now I can update
my status to "Freezing!"

28:06.786 --> 28:09.119
- Mommy, Daddy,
I miss Hiddenville.

28:09.121 --> 28:10.888
- BARB: Awww.
- I know, honey.

28:10.890 --> 28:14.324
But we live here now.

28:14.326 --> 28:15.325
- Come on, sweetie,

28:15.327 --> 28:18.262
let's go free your
dolly from its...

28:18.264 --> 28:20.864
ice prison.

28:22.268 --> 28:23.467
- I feel bad.

28:23.469 --> 28:24.868
If it wasn't for us,

28:24.870 --> 28:26.136
Chloe would still
be in Hiddenville

28:26.138 --> 28:28.972
and wouldn't have to
play with doll cubes.

28:28.974 --> 28:31.008
- Hey, what if we recreated

28:31.010 --> 28:33.744
Chloe's favorite things
about Hiddenville

28:33.746 --> 28:35.245
right here in Antarctica?

28:35.247 --> 28:36.180
- That's a great idea.

28:36.182 --> 28:39.049
I'm gonna take
my breakfast to go.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.291
- You got
the internet working?

28:47.293 --> 28:48.759
That's amazing.
- Thank you.

28:48.761 --> 28:50.728
- 'Cause, you know, usually
you just destroy things,

28:50.730 --> 28:52.429
you know, like you
destroyed Splatburger

28:52.431 --> 28:55.099
and my Z Force dream!

28:55.101 --> 28:57.334
- I seem to remember
Mrs. Wong shaking her fist

28:57.336 --> 29:00.370
at both of us
from the ambulance.

29:00.372 --> 29:03.907
- [watch ringing]
- Colosso's calling.

29:03.909 --> 29:06.744
Well, look who
came hoppin' back.

29:06.746 --> 29:09.313
- Max, you've gotta get
back to Hiddenville!

29:09.315 --> 29:10.314
Your friends are in danger,

29:10.316 --> 29:15.018
and that Candi girl is trying
to brainwash the whole to--ah!

29:16.455 --> 29:17.788
- Colosso!

29:17.790 --> 29:18.756
Did you hear that, Phoebe?

29:18.758 --> 29:20.457
He said all our
friends are in danger.

29:20.459 --> 29:21.925
- Please, your little
dress-up buddy

29:21.927 --> 29:23.761
would say anything
to get you back.

29:23.763 --> 29:26.430
- Just do me a favor
and call Cherry.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.064
- [sighing]

29:27.066 --> 29:31.201
Fine, but only so
I can stop talking to you.

29:31.937 --> 29:34.338
Call declined?
That's weird.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.439
Cherry always
answers my calls.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.908
She even answered that one
time she went scuba diving.

29:37.910 --> 29:41.011
Her phone was
in rice for months.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.881
- Well, that proves it.
Something is seriously wrong.

29:43.883 --> 29:46.316
- I guess it wouldn't hurt
to tell Mom and Dad.

29:46.318 --> 29:47.351
- Tell them what?

29:47.353 --> 29:48.552
My rabbit's a drama queen

29:48.554 --> 29:51.088
and Cherry doesn't
understand how phones work?

29:51.090 --> 29:53.223
I'm going back
to Hiddenville to help.

29:53.225 --> 29:54.057
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Max!

29:54.059 --> 29:55.893
If President Kickbutt
catches you back in Hiddenville,

29:55.895 --> 29:58.829
you'll lose your powers and
you'll never be a superhero.

29:58.831 --> 30:00.130
- I'm willing to
take that risk.

30:00.132 --> 30:03.000
I'm not letting Hiddenville
down a second time.

30:03.002 --> 30:06.203
If you wanna stay here,
that's on you.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.839
- Max, wait!

30:08.841 --> 30:09.940
I'm going with you.

30:09.942 --> 30:11.041
What good is being
a superhero,

30:11.043 --> 30:13.143
if you're not gonna protect
the people you care about?

30:13.145 --> 30:17.981
- [seals barking]
- Just share the fish!

30:18.350 --> 30:19.316
- All right, if we do this,

30:19.318 --> 30:22.252
we have to try our best
to not get caught.

30:22.254 --> 30:27.591
Lucky for us,
I'm a master of disguise.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.360
- [whooshing]

30:30.362 --> 30:31.528
- Glasses, Max?

30:31.530 --> 30:33.363
- Who is this Max
you speak of?

30:33.365 --> 30:36.600
I'm just a boy
with poor eyesight.

30:37.469 --> 30:38.869
- Thanks for
the ride, Chloe.

30:38.871 --> 30:40.871
Remember, don't tell
anyone we're here.

30:40.873 --> 30:43.240
- Duh! I'm not
losing my powers.

30:43.242 --> 30:45.309
[whooshing]

30:46.178 --> 30:48.912
- Okay, Candi, let's
find out what you're up to.

30:48.914 --> 30:52.149
- Don't knock.
- It's not our house anymore.

30:52.151 --> 30:53.951
- Just go in.
- Okay.

30:53.953 --> 30:56.420
- [party music]

30:56.422 --> 30:59.256
- We risked our powers
to go to a party?

30:59.258 --> 31:02.459
- Allison hates parties.

31:02.461 --> 31:05.162
Let's find out
what's going on.

31:05.164 --> 31:08.131
Hey, Allison.

31:08.133 --> 31:09.266
Are you guys okay?

31:09.268 --> 31:11.535
- ALL: [robotically]
Candi Falconman is my bestie

31:11.537 --> 31:15.339
and the sweetest person
I've ever met.

31:16.575 --> 31:19.243
- It's like
they're hypnotized.

31:19.245 --> 31:24.648
- Candi Falconman
is my Wolfgang und Wolfgang.

31:26.318 --> 31:29.152
- Oh, no, she got
Wolfgang, too.

31:29.154 --> 31:30.520
- We need to find Candi.

31:30.522 --> 31:33.056
- CANDI: You found her.
[giggling]

31:33.058 --> 31:35.325
Welcome to my party.

31:35.327 --> 31:38.896
Raspberry pixie dust?
[blowing air]

31:38.898 --> 31:41.231
- MAX & PHOEBE:
[groan, thud]

31:41.233 --> 31:44.401
- [giggling]

31:49.375 --> 31:52.476
- ¶

31:52.478 --> 31:54.044
- Max?
- MAX: [snoring loudly]

31:54.046 --> 31:55.612
- PHOEBE: Max, wake up!
- MAX: Huh?

31:55.614 --> 31:57.648
[sniffing]
What smells so good?

31:57.650 --> 31:59.316
- Us.

32:02.988 --> 32:06.556
She trapped us in
sticky cotton candy.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.292
- Oh, forget about us.

32:08.294 --> 32:11.328
Look what she did
to my sweet lair!

32:13.532 --> 32:16.199
- [dramatic music]

32:16.201 --> 32:20.404
- It's my sweet lair now.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.639
- Okay, freeze this freak.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.508
- BOTH:
[blowing frosty air]

32:24.510 --> 32:27.611
- Oh, powers
don't work on me.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.080
[giggles]
I'm candy-coated.

32:30.082 --> 32:31.048
[giggles]

32:31.050 --> 32:32.015
- Colosso, help us.

32:32.017 --> 32:33.216
You're the one who
called us here.

32:33.218 --> 32:38.422
- That was before I decided
Candi's my sugar mama.

32:38.424 --> 32:41.291
- But Max is your sugar mama.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.994
You know it's true.

32:45.331 --> 32:46.697
- You used my Brainwash XL

32:46.699 --> 32:49.166
to turn everyone
into your besties?

32:49.168 --> 32:50.467
- That's right.

32:50.469 --> 32:53.303
And after I hook it up to
your satellite on the roof,

32:53.305 --> 32:56.440
I'll use it on
all of Hiddenville.

32:56.442 --> 32:57.074
[giggling]

32:57.076 --> 32:59.309
- Why can't you just make
friends the normal way?

32:59.311 --> 33:02.746
- Oh, I try, but no
matter how sweet I am,

33:02.748 --> 33:06.750
they refuse to worship me!

33:06.752 --> 33:09.052
- Huh, who'd have thought
a child of superheroes

33:09.054 --> 33:10.554
could become a supervillain.

33:10.556 --> 33:13.457
[gasps]
Oh, right. That's me.

33:13.459 --> 33:17.027
- Just be glad I didn't turn
you into gingerbread cookies--

33:17.029 --> 33:19.629
like I did to my parents.
[giggling]

33:19.631 --> 33:22.165
They live there now.

33:22.167 --> 33:25.068
- FALCON MAN: Let us
out of here, Princess!

33:25.070 --> 33:27.604
- No-o-o-o-o!

33:27.606 --> 33:28.372
[sighing]

33:28.374 --> 33:30.374
Off to brainwash the town.

33:30.376 --> 33:32.709
[giggling]

33:33.746 --> 33:37.180
- PHOEBE:
[straining]

33:37.182 --> 33:38.448
- MAX:
[strains]

33:38.450 --> 33:39.082
- It's no use.

33:39.084 --> 33:40.450
This was my one chance
to redeem myself

33:40.452 --> 33:42.486
for endangering
the town and I failed.

33:42.488 --> 33:45.589
- Phoebe, we can't let some
sugar-crazed twerp

33:45.591 --> 33:47.224
take over Hiddenville.

33:47.226 --> 33:48.558
- You won't!

33:48.560 --> 33:49.659
'Cause I'm gonna save ya!

33:49.661 --> 33:52.162
- You are? I thought you
were on Candi's side.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.264
You're even dressed
like her furry twin.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.633
- I was just pretending
to be on Candi's side--

33:56.635 --> 33:59.403
so she wouldn't turn
me into a chocolate bunny.

33:59.405 --> 34:02.272
- But you said you hated
me for turning good.

34:02.274 --> 34:02.773
- I did.

34:02.775 --> 34:04.775
But I miss my best friend.

34:04.777 --> 34:08.545
And I want
my sugar mama back!

34:08.714 --> 34:10.714
- Aw, I missed you, too, buddy.
- Okay, cool.

34:10.716 --> 34:13.617
If you guys are done with
your couples' counselling,

34:13.619 --> 34:14.751
could we get outta here?

34:14.753 --> 34:18.121
- Ah! Time to
eat you free.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.824
Good thing it's
my treats day.

34:20.826 --> 34:23.760
[gnawing]

34:24.363 --> 34:26.463
- Okay, Chloe, we know
you miss Hiddenville

34:26.465 --> 34:31.101
and since it's dinnertime,
we thought we could eat at...

34:31.103 --> 34:33.236
- BILLY & NORA:
Splatburger!

34:33.238 --> 34:34.671
- Cool!

34:34.673 --> 34:35.672
- BILLY:
[zooming]

34:35.674 --> 34:37.407
- Aw, the kids
are so thoughtful.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.576
- I can't believe
she's gettin' served.

34:39.578 --> 34:42.245
We were here first.

34:43.182 --> 34:47.818
- One hamburger, please?
- [tablet bleeps]

34:47.820 --> 34:51.221
- Billy, that's your cue.

34:51.223 --> 34:54.124
- [ice, snow,
Billy thudding]

34:58.197 --> 34:58.862
- [groans]

34:58.864 --> 35:01.798
Would you like
fries with that?

35:04.470 --> 35:06.703
- ALL: Candi Falconman
is my bestie

35:06.705 --> 35:09.206
and the sweetest person
I've ever met.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.640
- Wolfgang.

35:10.642 --> 35:13.577
- Aw, you guys don't
have to say that.

35:13.579 --> 35:17.514
Oh, actually you do
because I made you!

35:17.516 --> 35:18.415
[giggling]

35:18.417 --> 35:22.452
- Candy may be sweet,
but so is ice cream.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.454
- Hold on a second, Candi.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.323
What?!

35:26.325 --> 35:27.424
- You two escaped?

35:27.426 --> 35:30.193
Crush them like
peanut brittle!

35:32.598 --> 35:35.265
- We've gotta stop them
without hurting our friends.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.234
- [powers whooshing]

35:38.537 --> 35:40.203
- MAX:
Excuse me.

35:40.205 --> 35:41.905
Allison, you've
been brainwashed,

35:41.907 --> 35:44.241
but I know deep-down
you're still my bae--

35:44.243 --> 35:46.576
- [punches]
- MAX: [groans]

35:46.578 --> 35:48.745
- [powers whooshing]
- [pillow thuds]

35:48.747 --> 35:51.348
- ALL: Candi Falconman
is my bestie

35:51.350 --> 35:53.850
and the sweetest
person I've ever met.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.852
- We're surrounded.
There's too many of them.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.220
- PHOEBE:
Wait!

35:57.222 --> 35:59.422
How can you all be Candi
Falconman's bestie, huh?

35:59.424 --> 36:02.325
A person can only
have one bestie.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.194
- Which means everyone here

36:04.196 --> 36:07.230
is trying to steal
your new best friend.

36:07.232 --> 36:09.966
- [gasps] Candi Falconman
is my bestie.

36:09.968 --> 36:11.902
- Candi Falconman
is my bestie.

36:11.904 --> 36:13.770
- Candi Falconman
is my bestie.

36:13.772 --> 36:16.740
- Candi Falconman
is my Wolfgang.

36:16.742 --> 36:22.512
- ALL: [angrily]
Candi Falconman is my bestie.

36:23.682 --> 36:24.915
- Okay, Chloe,
let's move on to

36:24.917 --> 36:28.285
another of your favorite
things about Hiddenville--

36:28.287 --> 36:30.654
Max's slide!

36:30.656 --> 36:32.656
- Is that thing safe?

36:32.658 --> 36:37.360
- Don't know. That's
why I sent Billy first.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.762
- BILLY:
[screaming]

36:38.764 --> 36:42.265
- [heavy thud,
ice cracking]

36:42.267 --> 36:44.935
- I'll pass.

36:46.405 --> 36:51.341
- Brrr! I'm gonna
put some ice on my head.

36:53.912 --> 36:56.246
- I still miss Hiddenville.

36:56.248 --> 36:57.847
- Me, too.
I wanna go home.

36:57.849 --> 37:01.484
- Look, guys,
home isn't a place on a map.

37:01.486 --> 37:03.820
Home is where
your family is.

37:03.822 --> 37:06.690
Home's in your heart.
- BARB: Mm-hm.

37:06.692 --> 37:09.259
- Our hearts are freezing.

37:09.661 --> 37:10.794
- The kids are right, Hank.

37:10.796 --> 37:12.562
Our family belongs
in Hiddenville.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.664
- I know, but you heard
President Kickbutt.

37:14.666 --> 37:17.334
We can't ever go back.
- BARB: [sighing]

37:17.336 --> 37:20.303
- Why not? I took
Max and Phoebe.

37:20.305 --> 37:24.341
- Chloe, you teleported
Max and Phoebe

37:24.343 --> 37:27.277
back to Hiddenville?

37:29.481 --> 37:31.715
- This is awkward.

37:31.717 --> 37:35.585
- ¶

37:35.587 --> 37:38.488
[dramatic music]

37:38.490 --> 37:40.390
¶

37:40.392 --> 37:41.358
- MAX:
There's Candi.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.326
We can't let her
get that signal out.

37:43.328 --> 37:45.629
- Okay, let's quietly
sneak over and see--

37:45.631 --> 37:46.730
Whoa!

37:46.732 --> 37:49.733
- ALL: Candi Falconman
is my bestie.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.735
Candi Falconman is my...

37:51.737 --> 37:52.869
- PHOEBE:
[sighing]

37:52.871 --> 37:55.505
Why did we let Dad
fly through this roof?

37:55.507 --> 37:57.741
- Oh, back for more candy?

37:57.743 --> 38:02.012
- [licorice whipping]
- How about a licorice whip?

38:02.014 --> 38:04.981
- [dramatic music]

38:04.983 --> 38:06.383
- MAX:
[gasps]

38:06.385 --> 38:08.351
- I'll get her, Max.

38:08.353 --> 38:09.753
- [roof cracks]
- Oh!

38:09.755 --> 38:14.624
- The only thing you'll get
is a candy-canderang.

38:14.626 --> 38:15.925
- Whoa!

38:15.927 --> 38:17.093
Oh, is that all you got?

38:17.095 --> 38:18.928
- [boomerang thuds]
- Ow!

38:18.930 --> 38:21.498
No, you got more.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.066
- MAX:
Whoa!

38:23.068 --> 38:25.902
- [gum splats]
- [straining]

38:25.904 --> 38:28.038
Trapped in gum.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.472
[slurping]

38:29.474 --> 38:31.908
It's banana flavored. Ugh!

38:31.910 --> 38:32.942
- [licorice whipping]

38:32.944 --> 38:34.944
- [powers whooshing]
- Oops!

38:34.946 --> 38:37.047
Looks like you
dropped something.

38:37.049 --> 38:38.748
- Oh, that reminds me.

38:38.750 --> 38:42.919
Have some lemon drops.
- [candies clattering]

38:42.921 --> 38:45.922
- Hope you don't fall.

38:45.924 --> 38:46.756
- Ha!

38:46.758 --> 38:48.391
- [roof cracks]
- Whoa!

38:48.393 --> 38:49.125
- [giggling]

38:49.127 --> 38:53.063
- I don't know what's more
dangerous--you or this roof.

38:53.065 --> 38:54.631
- [gum splats]

38:54.633 --> 38:58.134
- Aw, did I gum
up your plans?

38:58.136 --> 39:00.070
[giggling]

39:00.072 --> 39:02.572
- [flicks switch]

39:02.741 --> 39:05.141
- All I have to do
is enter the coordinates

39:05.143 --> 39:06.076
and this satellite dish

39:06.078 --> 39:07.811
will turn all
of Hiddenville

39:07.813 --> 39:10.980
into my mindless besties!

39:11.383 --> 39:14.617
- Okay, maybe I can hit
that satellite dish

39:14.619 --> 39:15.685
with my heat breath.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.087
- No, we should
use our freeze breath.

39:17.089 --> 39:18.088
- Heat breath.
- Freeze brea--

39:18.090 --> 39:21.691
Wait, why don't we just do what
we did back at Splatburger?

39:21.693 --> 39:22.826
- Make fun of Mrs. Wong?

39:22.828 --> 39:24.394
How will that
help us now?

39:24.396 --> 39:27.664
- No, combine our heat
and freeze breath.

39:27.666 --> 39:30.934
- [frosty air blowing]
- [fiery air blowing]

39:30.936 --> 39:33.069
- No, no!
What's happening?

39:33.071 --> 39:36.139
- [electrical zapping]

39:36.141 --> 39:37.841
- [satellite dish
powers down]

39:37.843 --> 39:39.142
- Oh, butterscotch.

39:39.144 --> 39:42.979
- [explosion]
- [candies clattering]

39:42.981 --> 39:45.448
- ALL:
...is my bestie!

39:46.184 --> 39:47.851
- What's going on?

39:47.853 --> 39:49.853
- Wolfgang?

39:49.855 --> 39:52.122
- Why am I at a party?
I hate parties!

39:52.124 --> 39:55.592
- Ah! Do you also
hate my arm?

39:57.629 --> 40:00.497
- Max, we did it.
- MAX: [laughs]

40:00.499 --> 40:04.067
Wait. What happened
to Candi?

40:05.437 --> 40:05.902
- There!

40:05.904 --> 40:09.739
Splatburger is
as good as new.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.074
- [object whistling]

40:11.076 --> 40:14.144
- [heavy thud]
- [plaster splatters]

40:16.748 --> 40:19.048
- I hate this town!

40:19.785 --> 40:22.085
- Me, too.

40:24.523 --> 40:27.657
- PHOEBE: Yay, party's over.
Everybody out.

40:27.659 --> 40:32.529
- Sweetcious. I found
a lemon drop in my hair.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.899
- Wolfgang confuzen.

40:35.901 --> 40:38.168
- Wolfgang goodbyezen.

40:38.170 --> 40:39.903
- [door slams]

40:39.905 --> 40:40.770
- Good party--

40:40.772 --> 40:43.173
except for all the brainwashing
and the crazy girl.

40:43.175 --> 40:45.909
- Thanks for making
us come back here.

40:45.911 --> 40:46.810
I'm sorry I doubted you.

40:46.812 --> 40:49.145
You actually are
a pretty good superhero.

40:49.147 --> 40:50.180
- Thanks.

40:50.182 --> 40:50.980
It means a lot.

40:50.982 --> 40:54.150
- Now we should probably
get outta here before--

40:54.152 --> 40:56.052
- [whooshing]

40:56.054 --> 40:56.853
- They show up?

40:56.855 --> 40:59.656
- I was gonna say "before
President Kickbutt shows up."

40:59.658 --> 41:01.691
- [door opens]

41:02.928 --> 41:04.928
- I thought I was clear.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.029
If you came back
to Hiddenville,

41:06.031 --> 41:08.531
I'd be forced
to take your powers.

41:08.533 --> 41:10.066
- President Kickbutt, wait.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.501
I know we disobeyed
your orders,

41:11.503 --> 41:13.670
but our town
and our friends needed us.

41:13.672 --> 41:17.207
- They came back because
they love Hiddenville.

41:17.209 --> 41:19.075
We all do.
- Yeah.

41:19.077 --> 41:21.077
If you wanna punish
a family of heroes

41:21.079 --> 41:24.914
for loving their home,
then go ahead,

41:24.916 --> 41:25.615
take our powers.

41:25.617 --> 41:27.550
- PRESIDENT KICKBUTT:
We are gathered here

41:27.552 --> 41:32.088
to take
the Thundermans' powers.

41:32.090 --> 41:34.924
- Great speech, Phoebe.

41:34.926 --> 41:36.059
- I meant every word of it.

41:36.061 --> 41:37.994
Hiddenville is safe
because of us.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.063
We won't be
superheroes anymore,

41:40.065 --> 41:42.866
but at least we'll be home.

41:43.869 --> 41:45.702
- Is this gonna hurt them?

41:45.704 --> 41:46.836
- No.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.571
- Can it?

41:49.841 --> 41:53.009
- I'm sorry I have
to do this.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.678
- [powers zapping]

41:57.849 --> 42:00.016
- There. It is done.

42:00.018 --> 42:01.851
- And, so, the once
mighty Thundermans

42:01.853 --> 42:05.688
have been rendered powerless
and completely uninteresting.

42:05.690 --> 42:09.859
Next up, a dog who
can salsa dance.

42:10.028 --> 42:15.632
- Well, I guess that's it.
We're no longer supes.

42:15.634 --> 42:17.867
- What do normal people do?

42:17.869 --> 42:18.868
- Can we figure this out

42:18.870 --> 42:22.005
while we're watching
the salsa-dancing dog?

42:22.007 --> 42:24.240
- ¶

42:24.242 --> 42:29.245
- I just wish I could have
lasered Billy one last time.

42:29.247 --> 42:31.714
[lasers zapping]
- Ow!

42:31.716 --> 42:32.615
- Nora?

42:32.617 --> 42:34.851
Did you just use
your powers?

42:34.853 --> 42:36.119
- I think so.

42:36.121 --> 42:38.121
- Let's see if I still
have mine, too.

42:38.123 --> 42:39.756
[zooms, thuds]

42:39.758 --> 42:41.024
[groaning]

42:41.026 --> 42:43.860
I mean, yay.

42:43.862 --> 42:47.130
- [blowing frosty air]
- [blowing fiery air]

42:47.132 --> 42:50.767
- [whooshing]

42:50.769 --> 42:51.868
- [metal whines]

42:51.870 --> 42:54.604
- [powers zapping]

42:55.173 --> 42:57.807
- President Kickbutt,
what's going on?

42:57.809 --> 42:59.909
- I didn't take your powers.

42:59.911 --> 43:01.911
I just needed to
convince the town

43:01.913 --> 43:02.745
you're not supes anymore,

43:02.747 --> 43:06.082
so things can go back
to the way they were.

43:06.084 --> 43:09.185
- But I don't get it.
We disobeyed your orders.

43:09.187 --> 43:11.988
- Just say "thank you."

43:13.391 --> 43:14.824
- It's like you
said, Phoebe,

43:14.826 --> 43:17.794
you and Max risked everything
to save the town--

43:17.796 --> 43:21.331
and that's what makes you
both true superheroes.

43:21.333 --> 43:22.131
- Great speech, Phoebe.

43:22.133 --> 43:26.970
- Just make sure you keep your
family secret safe this time.

43:26.972 --> 43:29.772
- [toilet flushes]

43:32.210 --> 43:35.378
- Sorry.
Didn't hear a thing.

43:35.380 --> 43:37.947
[quietly]
I heard everything.

43:37.949 --> 43:39.248
Call me.

43:39.250 --> 43:42.685
- We're so proud of you guys
for working together

43:42.687 --> 43:45.088
to save Hiddenville.

43:45.090 --> 43:45.888
- No problem.

43:45.890 --> 43:49.092
Just don't expect us to
make this a regular thing.

43:49.094 --> 43:50.960
- MALE VOICE:
Congratulations,

43:50.962 --> 43:52.295
Max and Phoebe Thunderman.

43:52.297 --> 43:54.797
You are now both
finalists for a slot

43:54.799 --> 43:57.734
on the legendary Z Force--

43:57.736 --> 43:59.335
as a team!

43:59.337 --> 44:02.238
- PHOEBE & MAX:
A team?

44:04.109 --> 44:07.777
- Now this is awkward.

44:13.385 --> 44:29.499
- ¶
