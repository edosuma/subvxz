00:40.074 --> 00:42.307
I'm kicking mad butt
in this game!

00:42.343 --> 00:44.309
I just unlocked
the bunny bazooka!

00:44.345 --> 00:47.046
I almost have enough points
to get the bunny rattle...

00:47.081 --> 00:49.314
to smash my opponents
into the ground!

00:49.350 --> 00:50.949
Wait till you get to the end

00:50.985 --> 00:52.885

00:52.920 --> 00:54.453
It's so cute!

00:54.488 --> 00:56.755
You already beat the game?

00:56.791 --> 00:59.072
I didn't have to beat it.
I <i> made</i> it.

00:59.927 --> 01:02.194
You made "Baybee Bunnies"?!

01:02.229 --> 01:03.862
Yeah, I love to make games.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.297
Remember two weeks ago

01:05.331 --> 01:08.100
when I made that Mojo
meme generator?

01:08.135 --> 01:09.135
That was you?

01:10.438 --> 01:12.004
Or when I made
that Pug-Yer-Mug app?

01:12.039 --> 01:13.439
Wow!

01:13.474 --> 01:15.774
I really gotta start paying
more attention to Bubbles!

01:15.810 --> 01:17.276
Right after I beat this level...

01:17.311 --> 01:19.411
Bubbles, I didn't know
you could program.

01:19.480 --> 01:23.015
Yeah. But I can only make
silly stuff like games.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.950
This... is... amazing!

01:24.985 --> 01:26.819
If you nurture your talent,

01:26.854 --> 01:30.122
you could be a software engineer
or work for NASA!

01:31.492 --> 01:33.892
Uh, that sounds like a lot
of pressure.

01:33.928 --> 01:36.829
No way! It's like a game, too...
in space!

01:36.864 --> 01:39.498
With human lives at stake!

01:39.533 --> 01:42.868
Amoeba boys,
did ya hear the news?

01:42.903 --> 01:45.143
Yeah, did ya hear the news?

01:45.172 --> 01:47.239
Yeah! Ha!

01:47.274 --> 01:49.308
I can lower my blood pressure

01:49.343 --> 01:51.743
just by reducing salt
in my diet.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.278
No, ya dummy!

01:53.314 --> 01:56.181
That new game the
Powerpuff Girls made,

01:56.217 --> 01:58.250
everyone in Townsville loves it.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.885
Now if we screw it up,

01:59.920 --> 02:02.888
those girls will look like
a bunch of muttonheads.

02:02.923 --> 02:06.458
And we'll be the baddest
baddies around.

02:06.494 --> 02:09.961
Now, let's figure out how to
screw up that game.

02:12.366 --> 02:15.000
Perhaps you could use some help?

02:15.035 --> 02:17.336
Huh? Oh, yeah?

02:17.371 --> 02:19.204
What's it to you, bub?

02:19.240 --> 02:21.807
I believe we share
a common enemy...

02:21.842 --> 02:24.176
You are the Amoeba Boys,
correct?

02:24.211 --> 02:27.379
The most notorious villains
in Townsville?

02:27.414 --> 02:28.881
Who's asking?

02:28.916 --> 02:31.884
You can call me "Silico."

02:31.919 --> 02:36.355
And I have just what you need to
get your heads in that game.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.490
Hey!
What's this?

02:38.526 --> 02:40.893
It will not only
destroy the game,

02:40.961 --> 02:45.364
but it will wipe out
the entire Internet.

02:47.001 --> 02:49.835
It will be a worldwide
catastrophe.

02:51.071 --> 02:55.007
Which will really annoy
the Powerpuff Girls.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.842
- Aw, yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

02:56.877 --> 02:58.110
Give it up, Blossom.

02:58.145 --> 02:59.778
I'm three levels ahead of you.

02:59.813 --> 03:02.447
Argh!
The beaver boss is too hard!

03:02.483 --> 03:04.183
Block! Block!

03:04.218 --> 03:06.251
Come on, block!

03:06.287 --> 03:09.254
Try exchanging 50 power pellets
for flight ability.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.789
Oh, yeah!
Thanks!

03:12.793 --> 03:14.193
Thanks, Bubbles!

03:14.228 --> 03:17.462
Man, I wish I could fly
on a triceratops in real life.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.731
One day, Blossom.

03:19.767 --> 03:20.866
One day.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.035
Oh, great.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.303
<i>New challenger!</i>

The Amoeba Boys?
I didn't put them in the game!

03:28.842 --> 03:31.176
How is this possible?

03:31.212 --> 03:33.345
Take that, you losers!

03:33.380 --> 03:34.346
Ha ha!

03:34.381 --> 03:35.914
<i>- Ow!
- Hey!</i>

03:35.950 --> 03:37.216
This isn't funny, guys!

03:37.251 --> 03:39.251
If the Amoeba Boys
are in "Baybee Bunnies,"

03:39.286 --> 03:41.853
it means they have access
to the entire Internet!

03:41.889 --> 03:44.823
So what?
Those dudes are beyond harmless.

03:44.858 --> 03:47.092
What damage could <i> they</i>
possibly cause?

03:47.127 --> 03:48.760
Come on, boys.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.964
Let's see what damage
we can possibly cause.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.131
- Hey!
- All right!

03:53.167 --> 03:54.199

04:21.394 --> 04:25.063
<i>And that's how you make
a good-luck pie.</i>

04:25.099 --> 04:27.499

04:39.813 --> 04:42.447

it could create an E.M.P.

04:42.483 --> 04:45.183

back into the dark ages!

04:45.219 --> 04:46.385

10:02.402 --> 10:04.803
<i>The end, the end!</i>

10:04.838 --> 10:07.772
Oh, like the end of the game!
That's it!

10:07.808 --> 10:09.874
Don't worry, guys,
I know what to do!

10:09.910 --> 10:11.843
Sorry, Bossman.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.445
Game over!

10:15.449 --> 10:16.715
Huh?

10:18.385 --> 10:20.318
Mommy Bunny!
Mommy Bunny!

10:20.354 --> 10:21.753
No!

10:24.124 --> 10:26.825
Ah, forget it.

10:26.860 --> 10:30.328
We ain't cut out for this modern
technology stuff, boys.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.065
Bla-bbles!

10:34.101 --> 10:35.834
You're back!

10:35.869 --> 10:38.036
That was amazing!

10:38.071 --> 10:39.371
Dude, you killed it!

10:39.406 --> 10:40.972
Thanks, guys!

10:41.008 --> 10:43.208
But what were the Amoeba Boys
doing in there

10:43.276 --> 10:44.843
in the first place?

10:51.218 --> 10:53.218
Ah, Powerpuff Girls.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.387
You may have won the battle...

10:55.422 --> 10:57.288
But you've already lost...

10:57.324 --> 10:59.190
the war.
