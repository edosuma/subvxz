of some Vietnamese intelligence agents,

15:44.819 --> 15:46.988
men he believed were double agents.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.741
So he took matters into his own hands.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.954
Well, you see, Willard,

15:56.706 --> 15:58.124
in this war, things get...

15:59.959 --> 16:01.169
confused out there.

16:02.962 --> 16:08.092

and practical military necessity.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.097
But out there with these natives,

16:14.974 --> 16:18.186
it must be a temptation to...

16:19.687 --> 16:20.563
be God.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.195
Because there's a conflict
in every human heart,

16:28.863 --> 16:30.573
between the rational and irrational,

16:32.533 --> 16:33.618
between good and evil,

16:35.995 --> 16:37.788
and good does not always triumph.

17:19.497 --> 17:20.373
Yes, sir.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.000
[clears throats] Very much so, sir.
Obviously insane.

17:27.922 --> 17:31.676
Your mission is to proceed
up the Nung River, in a Navy patrol boat.

17:31.759 --> 17:32.635
[clears throat]

17:33.427 --> 17:35.972
Pick up Colonel Kurtz's path
at Nu Mung Ba,

17:36.806 --> 17:38.724
follow it, learn what you can
along the way.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.311
When you find the colonel,
infiltrate his team

17:42.436 --> 17:45.022
by... [clears throat]
...whatever means available

17:46.023 --> 17:47.775
and terminate the colonel's command.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.909
Terminate... the colonel?

17:58.035 --> 18:01.872
He's out there
operating without any decent restraint,

18:02.456 --> 18:07.295
totally beyond the pale of
any acceptable human conduct

18:08.671 --> 18:10.881
and he's still in the field,
commanding troops.

18:12.883 --> 18:13.843
Terminate...

18:14.802 --> 18:16.095
with extreme prejudice.

18:18.014 --> 18:21.601
[Lucas] You understand, Captain,
that this mission does not exist...

18:23.352 --> 18:24.812
nor will it ever exist.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.286
[Willard] How many people
had I already killed?

19:24.246 --> 19:26.415
There were those six
that I knew about for sure...

19:28.209 --> 19:30.795
close enough to blow their last breath
in my face.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.050
But this time, it was an American

19:37.385 --> 19:38.427
and an officer.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.233
That wasn't supposed to make
any difference to me,

19:53.192 --> 19:54.193
but it did.

19:57.029 --> 19:57.905
Shit...

19:58.739 --> 20:00.574
charging a man with murder in this place

20:00.658 --> 20:03.494
was like handing out speeding tickets
at the Indy 500.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.373
I took the mission.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.875
What the hell else was I going to do?

20:12.336 --> 20:14.797
But I really didn't know
what I'd do when I found him.

20:28.811 --> 20:31.939
I was being ferried down the coast
in a Navy PBR,

20:32.398 --> 20:34.108
a type of plastic patrol boat,

20:34.358 --> 20:35.818
pretty common sight on the rivers.

20:37.111 --> 20:39.155
They said it was a good way
to pick up information

20:39.238 --> 20:41.031
and move without drawing
a lot of attention.

20:42.116 --> 20:43.117
That was okay.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.494
I needed the air and the time.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.415
Only problem was, I wouldn't be alone.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.499
Morning, Captain.

20:53.836 --> 20:55.796
The crew were mostly just kids,

20:57.047 --> 20:59.467
rock 'n' rollers with one foot
in their graves.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.261
How old are you?

21:02.803 --> 21:03.721
Seventeen.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.808
[Willard] The machinist, the one they
called "Chef", was from New Orleans.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.311
He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam...

21:11.395 --> 21:13.272
probably wrapped too tight
for New Orleans.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.525
Lance, on the forward 50s,
was a famous surfer

21:16.609 --> 21:18.194
from the beaches south of L.A.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.947
To look at him, you wouldn't believe
he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.

21:24.950 --> 21:29.205
"Clean", Mr. Clean, was from
some South Bronx shit-hole

21:29.288 --> 21:31.415
and I think the light and space of Vietnam

21:31.499 --> 21:32.917
really put the zap on his head.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.255
Then there was Phillips, the chief.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.466
It might have been my mission...

21:40.883 --> 21:42.635
but it sure as shit was the chief's boat.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.136
There's about two points

21:44.220 --> 21:46.597
where we can draw enough water
to get into the Nung River.

21:47.723 --> 21:48.641
They're both hot.

21:48.933 --> 21:49.850
Belong to Charlie.

21:51.977 --> 21:52.978
Don't worry about it.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.356
I don't smoke.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.735
You know,
I pulled a few special ops in here.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.321
About six months ago,

22:03.656 --> 22:06.450
I took a man who was going up
past the bridge at Do Lung.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.411
He was regular army, too.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.250
I heard he shot himself in the head.

with this man.

maybe too impressive,

25:00.207 --> 25:01.333
I mean perfect.

25:11.802 --> 25:15.848

with Advisory Command in Vietnam,

25:15.973 --> 25:17.057
and things started to slip.

25:18.392 --> 25:22.438

what he had to tell 'em.

Georgia,

25:34.867 --> 25:36.285

Well, it's an honor to meet you, Lance.
I've admired your nose-riding for years.

30:54.519 --> 30:57.314
I like your cutback, too.
I think you're the best cutback there is.

30:57.522 --> 30:58.482
Hey, thank you, sir.

30:58.732 --> 31:02.194
Well, you cut the "sir" crap, Lance.
I'm Bill Kilgore, I'm a goofy foot.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.779
-This guy with you?
-Yeah.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.158
-This is Mike from San Diego,
-Far out.

31:08.408 --> 31:09.409
Johnny from Malibu.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.536
-John, hi. Far out.
-We're pretty solid surfers.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.705
None of us are
anywhere near your class, though.

31:13.789 --> 31:14.664
No way!

31:15.207 --> 31:18.752
We do a lot of surfing around here, Lance,
I like to finish operations early,

31:18.960 --> 31:21.338
fly down to Yung Tau
for the evening glass.

31:31.181 --> 31:33.809
[priest] Through him in the unity
of the holy spirit.

31:34.017 --> 31:37.813
All glory and honor is yours,
almighty Father. Amen.

31:37.938 --> 31:40.148
-[explosion]
-Let us pray with confidence in the father

31:40.232 --> 31:42.025
and the words our savior gave us.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.694
-[helicopters whirring]
-[all] Our father who art in heaven,

31:44.820 --> 31:46.196
hallowed be thy name.

31:46.530 --> 31:50.909
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.163
[cow moos]

32:11.972 --> 32:14.349
[Willard] Kilgore'd had a pretty good day
for himself.

32:15.183 --> 32:17.436
They choppered in the T-bones and the beer

32:17.519 --> 32:19.396
and turned the L.Z. Into a beach party.

32:21.064 --> 32:23.400
The more they tried to make it
just like home,

32:23.900 --> 32:25.694
the more they made everybody miss it.

32:26.319 --> 32:29.281
[Kilgore] Make my meat rare.
Rare, but not cold!

32:29.781 --> 32:32.284
[singing and playing guitar]

32:35.829 --> 32:38.290
Well, he wasn't a bad officer, I guess.

32:38.582 --> 32:39.499
[clapping]

32:39.583 --> 32:42.502
He loved his boys
and you felt safe with him.

32:43.253 --> 32:46.131
He was one of those guys that had
that weird light around him.

32:46.756 --> 32:49.718
You just knew he wasn't going to get
so much as a scratch here.

32:50.010 --> 32:51.511
What happened to your mission, Captain?

32:51.887 --> 32:54.514
-Nha Trang forget all about you?
-[laughing]

33:02.397 --> 33:03.982
-[Kilgore] Here, boy.
-[laughs]

33:05.275 --> 33:06.193
Sir?

33:06.902 --> 33:09.404
-Two places we can get into the river.
-Yep.

33:09.696 --> 33:11.698
-Here and here.
-[Kilgore] Mm-hmm.

33:11.781 --> 33:14.743
It's a pretty wide delta, but these are
the only two spots I'm really sure of.

33:16.828 --> 33:19.206
Well, that village you're pointing at
is kinda hairy, Willard.

33:20.081 --> 33:21.208
What do you mean hairy, sir?

33:21.333 --> 33:23.627
It's hairy,
got some pretty heavy ordnance.

33:24.252 --> 33:26.588
I lost a few recon ships in there,
now and again.

33:27.297 --> 33:29.633
What's the name of that God damn village?
Vinh Drin...

33:30.258 --> 33:31.468
-[soldier] Drap?
-Dop or Lop

33:32.677 --> 33:34.596
Damn Gook names all sound the same.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.975
Mike, you know anything about
this point at Vinh Drin Dop?

33:40.143 --> 33:41.686
That's a fantastic peak.

33:42.270 --> 33:43.146
Peak?

33:43.230 --> 33:45.732
About 6 foot.
Yeah, it's an outstanding peak.

33:45.857 --> 33:49.194
It's got both a long right and left
slide, with a bowl section.

33:49.277 --> 33:50.946
It's unbelievable. It's just tube city.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.033
[distant explosions]

33:55.784 --> 33:57.869
Well, why didn't you tell me that before?
A good peak.

33:57.953 --> 34:00.121
There aren't any good peaks
in this whole shitty country.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.457
It's all God damn beach break.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.918
It's really hairy in there, sir.
That's where we lost McDonald.

34:05.001 --> 34:08.129
They shot the hell out of us there.
That's Charlie's point.

34:08.296 --> 34:09.798
[distant explosions]

34:09.923 --> 34:11.883
Sir, we can go in there tomorrow at dawn.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.761
There's always a good offshore breeze
in the morning.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.180
It'd mean I'd be able
to get the boat in,

34:17.264 --> 34:19.558
the draft at the mouth of that river
may be too shallow.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.978
Hell, we'll pick your boat up
and put it down like a baby

34:23.061 --> 34:26.273
right where you want it.
This is the 1st of the 9th. Air Cav, son.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.274
Air Mobile.

34:28.275 --> 34:30.860
I can take that point and hold it
just as long as I like

34:30.944 --> 34:33.572
and you can get anyplace up that river
that suits you, young Captain.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.449
Hell, a 6-foot peak.
[laughs]

34:36.533 --> 34:37.784
[soldier laughs]

34:38.034 --> 34:39.995
I'd like to take a gunship
back to the division.

34:40.078 --> 34:40.954
Lance, go with Mike.

34:41.037 --> 34:44.124
Let him pick out a board for you
and bring me my Yater Spoon, the 8'6".

34:44.207 --> 34:46.209
-[soldier] I don't know, sir, it's--
-What is it, soldier?

34:46.793 --> 34:49.337
Well, I mean, it's pretty hairy in there.
That's Charlie's point.

34:49.546 --> 34:50.880
Charlie don't surf!

34:51.673 --> 34:55.010
[helicopters whirring]

35:15.572 --> 35:18.033
Hey, Jesus, Clean,
you ain't going to believe this. Look.

35:19.909 --> 35:22.495
[Clean] Hey, man,
they're picking up the boat!

35:25.874 --> 35:27.292
[Kilgore] How're you feeling, Jimmy?

35:27.459 --> 35:29.294
Like a mean motherfucker, sir!

35:31.838 --> 35:33.673
All right, son, let her rip.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.217
-[bugle sounds charge]
-[Kilgore] Let's go!

36:58.800 --> 37:00.885
[Kilgore]
I never have got used to a light board.

37:01.261 --> 37:03.471
I can't get used to 'em,
I'm used to a heavy board.

37:03.596 --> 37:04.723
I know, it's a real drag.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.934
Do you use--
Do you prefer a heavy or a light board?

37:08.017 --> 37:08.893
Heavier.

37:08.977 --> 37:10.228
-Really?
-Yeah.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.564
I thought
the young guys liked lighter boards?

37:12.689 --> 37:16.025
-You can't ride the nose on those things--
-[man over radio] Big duke 6, this is

37:16.151 --> 37:17.944
Eagle Thrust 7. We've got it spotted.

37:18.027 --> 37:21.281
Big Duke 6 to Eagle Thrust.
Put on heading 2-7-0.

37:21.364 --> 37:22.782
Assume attack formation.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.701
[man over radio]
That's a roger, Big Duke.

37:24.826 --> 37:26.494
-Okay, we're going in.
-Hey, Lance.

37:27.287 --> 37:29.497
We'll come in low out of the rising sun

37:29.914 --> 37:32.167
and about a mile out,
we'll put on the music.

37:32.375 --> 37:33.251
Music?

37:33.418 --> 37:36.713
Yeah, I use Wagner.
It scares the hell out of the slopes.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.339
My boys love it.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.884
[Lance] Hey! They're going to play music!

37:47.974 --> 37:50.310
How come all you guys sit on your helmet?

37:51.561 --> 37:54.022
So we don't get our balls blown off.

37:55.857 --> 37:57.776
[Chef laughs]

38:05.617 --> 38:07.368
Big Duke 6 to Eagle Thrust.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.455
Put on psy-war-op. Make it loud.

38:10.955 --> 38:13.792
Bit of the Romeo Foxtrot, shall we dance?

38:14.125 --> 38:17.587
["Ride of the Valkyries" by Wagner plays]

down in the courtyard.

This L.Z.'s still pretty hot, sir.
Maybe you ought to surf somewhere else.

46:33.958 --> 46:37.378
What do you know about surfing, Major?
You're from God damn New Jersey.

46:39.588 --> 46:41.590
[Kilgore whistles] Come here. Come here!

46:44.802 --> 46:45.678
Change.

46:45.886 --> 46:47.221
You mean right now, sir?

46:47.346 --> 46:50.141
I want to see how rideable that stuff is.
Go change!

46:50.266 --> 46:52.018
It's still pretty hairy out there, sir.

46:52.101 --> 46:53.352
You want to surf, soldier?

46:53.477 --> 46:54.353
Yes, sir.

46:54.437 --> 46:56.897
That's good, son,
'cause you either surf or fight.

46:56.981 --> 46:58.899
Is that clear? Now, get going.

46:59.400 --> 47:01.944
I'll cover for 'em.
Let's bring a board for Lance.

47:02.528 --> 47:03.404
[Kilgore whistles]

47:03.571 --> 47:05.698
[Willard] We can't do shit
until the boat gets here!

47:06.115 --> 47:06.991
Lance.

47:07.992 --> 47:09.660
I'll bet you can't wait to get out there.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.579
-What?
-See how they break both ways?

47:11.829 --> 47:15.750
One guy can break right, one left,
simultaneously. What do you think of that?

47:15.875 --> 47:18.127
I think we ought to wait
for the tide to come up.

47:18.252 --> 47:19.754
Hey, hey, Lance, come here. Look! Look!

47:19.837 --> 47:20.838
[soldier] Incoming!

47:20.963 --> 47:22.089
[explosion]

47:23.758 --> 47:26.218
The tide doesn't come in for six hours.

47:28.429 --> 47:30.264
You want to wait here for six hours?

47:34.268 --> 47:36.228
Yo! Hey! Chief!

47:44.111 --> 47:49.116
Okay, fellas, quit hiding.
Come on. Let's go, dickheads, take off.

47:49.200 --> 47:52.620
God damn it! Don't you think
it's a little risky for R and R?

47:53.079 --> 47:57.625
If I say it's safe to surf this beach,
Captain, it's safe to surf this beach.

47:57.708 --> 47:59.502
I mean, I'm not afraid to surf this place.

47:59.585 --> 48:01.796
-[explosion]
-I'll stay and surf this fucking place.

48:03.339 --> 48:04.215
[gunshots]

48:04.590 --> 48:05.883
Give me that R.T. soldier.

48:07.259 --> 48:08.260
[gunshots]

48:08.344 --> 48:09.845
Dove-4. This is Big Duke 6.

48:10.513 --> 48:13.349
God damn it. I want that tree line bombed.

48:13.557 --> 48:16.102
[pilot] Big Duke 6, roger.
Dove 13, standby.

48:16.477 --> 48:18.187
[Kilgore] Bomb it into the stone age, son.

48:18.396 --> 48:20.064
[pilot 1] Hawk 12, Dove 13, roger.

48:20.147 --> 48:21.941
They need some napalm
down near the tree line.

48:22.024 --> 48:23.901
Can you guys twist around
and put it down there?

48:23.984 --> 48:26.487
[pilot 2] Right, 1-3. We're fixed
to fuck with them, what's the target?

48:26.904 --> 48:29.865
[pilot 1] Trying to suppress some mortar
fire off the tree line down there.

48:30.157 --> 48:31.325
[pilot 2] Roger, here we come.

48:31.492 --> 48:35.079
[pilot 1] Good. Give it all you got.
Bring in all your ships, wing abreast.

48:37.373 --> 48:39.083
Don't worry.
We'll have this place cleaned up

48:39.166 --> 48:41.377
and ready for us in a jiffy, son,
don't you worry.

48:42.670 --> 48:45.089
[pilot] Big Duke 6, this is Dove 13.
The jets are inbound now.

48:45.172 --> 48:47.091
They got about 30 seconds to bomb station.

48:47.174 --> 48:48.634
Get your people back and heads down.

48:48.717 --> 48:49.844
This is gonna be a big one.

48:51.554 --> 48:55.099
[jet engines roaring]

48:57.768 --> 49:00.354
[Kilgore] Do you see that? Look.

49:00.479 --> 49:02.940
[explosions]

49:12.950 --> 49:13.868
Do you smell that?

49:15.035 --> 49:16.245
Do you smell that?

49:16.328 --> 49:17.204
What?

49:17.913 --> 49:18.998
Napalm, son.

49:20.082 --> 49:22.001
Nothing else
in the world smells like that.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.045
[soldier] Come on.
Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it!

49:25.379 --> 49:26.464
[helicopters whirring]

49:27.089 --> 49:28.966
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

49:30.009 --> 49:32.636
You know, one time,
we had a hill bombed for 12 hours.

49:32.761 --> 49:34.305
When it was all over, I walked up.

49:35.347 --> 49:36.223
[distant explosion]

49:36.307 --> 49:38.934
We didn't find one of them,
not one stinking dink body.

49:41.479 --> 49:44.023
But the smell,
you know, that gasoline smell.

49:44.648 --> 49:45.608
The whole hill...

49:47.568 --> 49:48.444
it smelled like...

49:51.822 --> 49:52.740
victory.

49:55.826 --> 49:57.077
[explosion]

49:58.412 --> 49:59.872
Someday this war's going to end.

50:22.645 --> 50:23.521
Lance.

50:24.021 --> 50:26.690
[Clean] Chef, light up, man.
Come on, come on. Let's get high.

50:26.774 --> 50:28.692
-Wanna Smoke?
-[Clean] What you doing man, light up.

50:28.817 --> 50:30.444
[Willard] Someday this war's going to end.

50:32.238 --> 50:34.240
That'd be just fine
with the boys on the boat.

50:35.241 --> 50:37.326
They weren't looking for anything more
than a way home.

50:37.451 --> 50:38.410
[Chef] Captain?

50:39.203 --> 50:41.622
[Willard]
Trouble is, I've been back there,

50:42.706 --> 50:44.750
and I knew
that it just didn't exist anymore.

50:49.255 --> 50:50.214
[Lance] Buddha time.

50:51.840 --> 50:54.510
[Clean] All right. That's grass.
That's shit.

50:54.677 --> 50:55.553
Yeah.

51:00.391 --> 51:02.351
[Willard]
If that's how Kilgore fought the war,

51:03.018 --> 51:05.479
I began to wonder
what they really had against Kurtz.

51:07.022 --> 51:09.233
It wasn't just insanity and murder.

51:10.025 --> 51:12.027
There was enough of that to go around
for everyone.

51:20.744 --> 51:22.788
[Lance] The lady became his mistress...

51:23.831 --> 51:25.457
I mean, he never was hurting for pussy.

51:25.541 --> 51:27.793
-[Chef] Not here
-[soldier laughs]

51:28.335 --> 51:30.963
[Chef] I'm walking through the jungle
gathering mangoes.

51:32.339 --> 51:34.049
I meet Raquel Welch.

51:34.508 --> 51:36.385
[insects chirping]

51:36.760 --> 51:39.221
Make a nice mango cream pudding.

51:41.932 --> 51:44.977
Just, you know,
kind of spread it around on us.

51:46.812 --> 51:48.606
Hey, Captain, I want to get some mangoes.

51:50.024 --> 51:51.525
Just don't go out there by yourself.

51:52.901 --> 51:54.653
You don't want to go
in there alone,

51:56.405 --> 51:58.032
not unless you really know the territory.

51:58.282 --> 52:00.075
Any poisonous snakes around here?

52:00.659 --> 52:03.454
Fuck it.
I'm gonna go eat some mango.

52:11.879 --> 52:12.755
[Willard] Chef.

52:13.547 --> 52:14.465
Yes, sir?

52:14.757 --> 52:16.216
[Willard] How come they call you that?

52:16.550 --> 52:18.052
[Chef] Call me what, sir?

52:18.636 --> 52:20.679
[Willard] Chef.
Because you like mangoes and stuff?

52:20.929 --> 52:22.598
No, sir. I'm a real chef.

52:23.807 --> 52:25.142
I'm a saucier.

52:26.268 --> 52:27.227
[Willard] Saucier?

52:27.936 --> 52:28.812
[Chef] Yes, sir.

52:29.897 --> 52:31.440
See, I come from New Orleans.

52:31.774 --> 52:33.776
I was raised to be a saucier.

52:34.485 --> 52:35.611
A great saucier.

52:36.403 --> 52:37.863
[Willard] What's a saucier?

52:38.030 --> 52:39.907
[Chef] We specialize in sauces.

52:43.661 --> 52:46.080
[Chef] There's got to be
a mango tree here somewhere.

52:53.003 --> 52:57.508
Then I was supposed to go to Paris,
study at the Escoffier school.

52:58.842 --> 53:01.762
Then I got orders for my physical.

53:14.900 --> 53:17.986
Hell, I joined the navy.
Heard they had better food.

53:19.446 --> 53:21.448
Cook school, that did it.

53:21.907 --> 53:23.117
[Willard] Oh, yeah? How's that?

53:23.909 --> 53:25.786
[Chef] Oh, you don't want
to hear about that.

53:28.539 --> 53:31.917
They lined us up in front
of a hundred yards of prime rib.

53:32.751 --> 53:35.295
All of us, you know,
lined up looking at it.

53:36.004 --> 53:38.132
Magnificent meat, really,

53:38.757 --> 53:39.883
beautifully marbled.

53:41.051 --> 53:42.386
Magnifique.

53:43.011 --> 53:45.889
Next thing they're throwing the meat
into these big cauldrons.

53:46.807 --> 53:48.642
All of it. Boiling it.

53:50.144 --> 53:52.354
I looked inside, man,
it was turning gray.

53:54.106 --> 53:55.858
I couldn't fucking believe that one,

53:56.942 --> 53:58.736
that's when I applied
for radioman's school,

53:58.819 --> 54:00.320
but then they gave me the engine ma...

54:10.122 --> 54:13.041

Never get out of the fucking boat!

-Clean, bring that 60 forward!
-What?

[Chef] Never get out of the boat,
never get out of the boat!

55:26.907 --> 55:28.450
I got to remember,
never get out of the boat!

55:28.534 --> 55:30.369
-[Chief] Clean, on the 60.
-[Chef] Never get out of the boat!

55:30.452 --> 55:32.746
-[machine gun fire]
-[Clean] Get out of here now!

55:32.996 --> 55:34.248
What happened? How many is it?

55:34.456 --> 55:35.874
Fucking tiger!

55:36.124 --> 55:37.751
-What?
-[Chef] Fucking tiger!

55:37.835 --> 55:40.379
-Tiger?
-Yeah! I didn't come here for this!

55:40.504 --> 55:44.049
I'm done with this God damn fucking shit,
man!

55:44.132 --> 55:48.470
You can kiss my ass for the county square
because I'm fucking bugging out!

55:48.554 --> 55:50.514
I didn't come here for this!

55:50.973 --> 55:53.267
I don't fucking need it! I don't want it!

55:53.684 --> 55:57.020
I didn't get on the God damn A-train
for this kind of shit!

55:58.230 --> 56:00.232
All I want to do is fucking cook!

56:00.607 --> 56:02.901
I just want to learn to fucking cook, man!

56:03.151 --> 56:04.528
It's all right. You're all right.

56:04.653 --> 56:06.738
[Clean] For God's sake, man,
what happened, bro?

56:06.905 --> 56:09.116
[Chef laughs manically]

56:09.283 --> 56:10.659
[Lance] It's going to be all right.

56:10.909 --> 56:14.746
[Chef] All right. It's gonna be
all right, it's gonna be all right.

56:14.997 --> 56:18.625
Never get out of the fucking boat.
Never get out of the fucking boat.

56:18.709 --> 56:21.837
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger! Goodbye!

56:23.630 --> 56:25.382
[Willard] Never get out of the boat.

56:26.425 --> 56:28.385
Absolutely God damn right.

56:30.220 --> 56:31.889
Unless you were going all the way.

56:37.811 --> 56:39.271
Kurtz got off the boat.

56:41.315 --> 56:43.400
He split from the whole fuckin' program.

56:47.070 --> 56:48.447
How did that happen?

56:49.740 --> 56:52.075
What did he see here that first tour?

56:59.041 --> 57:01.168
Thirty-eight fucking years old.

57:02.628 --> 57:06.340
If you joined the green berets, there was
no way you'd ever get above colonel.

57:08.050 --> 57:09.426
Kurtz knew what he was giving up.

57:11.929 --> 57:14.097
The more I read and began to understand,

57:14.890 --> 57:16.141
the more I admired him.

57:17.517 --> 57:19.853
His family and friends couldn't
understand it,

57:20.187 --> 57:21.688
and they couldn't talk him out of it.

57:24.149 --> 57:27.486
He had to apply three times
and he put up with a ton of shit,

57:27.611 --> 57:30.489
but when he threatened to resign,
they gave it to him.

57:34.868 --> 57:38.163
The next youngest guy
in his class was half his age.

57:39.623 --> 57:43.001
They must have thought he was some far-out
old man humping it over that course.

57:44.878 --> 57:47.631
I did it when I was 19
and it damn near wasted me.

57:50.926 --> 57:52.678
A tough motherfucker.

57:54.554 --> 57:55.555
He finished it.

57:58.684 --> 58:00.310
He could have gone for general...

58:02.312 --> 58:04.106
but he went for himself instead.

58:07.567 --> 58:08.819
[Chef] Dear Eva,

58:09.569 --> 58:11.488
Today was really a new one.

58:12.447 --> 58:15.158
Almost got eaten alive by a fucking tiger.

58:17.285 --> 58:19.246
Really un-fucking-believable, you know?

58:19.663 --> 58:22.165
We're taking this guy, Captain Willard,
up the river,

58:22.541 --> 58:23.834
but he hasn't told us yet

58:23.917 --> 58:25.502
-where we're taking him.

They were going to nail his ass
to the floorboards for that one,

but after the press got a hold of it,
they promoted him to full colonel instead.

Ah, man.

1:01:44.868 --> 1:01:47.162

where I'm taking this boat, so I don't,

but one look at you, and I know
it's going to be hot, wherever it is.

I have been officially accused of murder
by the army."

The alleged victims were four Vietnamese
double agents.

We spent months uncovering them
and accumulating evidence.

1:12:58.165 --> 1:13:02.086
When absolute proof was completed,
we acted. We acted like soldiers.

1:13:03.671 --> 1:13:05.464
The charges are unjustified.

1:13:06.215 --> 1:13:07.091
They are, in fact,

of this conflict,

quite completely insane.

In a war, there are many moments
for compassion and tender action.

There are many moments
for ruthless action,

1:13:30.448 --> 1:13:32.199
what is often called ruthless,

1:13:33.075 --> 1:13:35.870

be only clarity,

and doing it...

[Chief] Chef! I said now!

1:14:43.187 --> 1:14:45.022
Chef! Knock it off!

1:14:45.106 --> 1:14:47.316
Give him a break!
What do you think I said?

1:14:47.817 --> 1:14:49.360
And give your jaws a rest!

1:14:50.277 --> 1:14:53.239
And this ain't the army.
You're a sailor!

1:14:53.948 --> 1:14:56.033
So get out of that frizzly
army looking shit

1:14:56.283 --> 1:14:58.911
and stop smoking that dope!
You hear me?

1:15:03.791 --> 1:15:06.293
Lance, what's with all the green paint?

1:15:06.419 --> 1:15:07.586
Camouflage.

1:15:07.795 --> 1:15:08.879
[Chief] How's that?

1:15:09.171 --> 1:15:11.090
So they can't see you.
They're everywhere, Chief.

1:15:11.757 --> 1:15:14.593
I want you to stay awake up there, man.
You got a job to do.

1:15:31.777 --> 1:15:33.362
Sand pan off the port bow.

1:15:33.863 --> 1:15:36.824
Sand pan off the port bow.
Let's take a look.

1:15:37.658 --> 1:15:39.869
-Lance, bring 'em in!
-[claxon sounding]

1:15:39.994 --> 1:15:41.704
Clean, on the 60.
Chef, get a 16.

1:15:42.455 --> 1:15:44.623
Clean, get on that 60!

1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:49.086
What's up, Chief?

1:15:51.213 --> 1:15:53.424
A junk boat, Captain.
We're gonna take a routine check.

1:15:54.425 --> 1:15:56.635
[Willard] Well, let's forget routine now
and let them go.

1:15:56.719 --> 1:15:59.263
These boats are running supplies
in this delta, Captain.

1:15:59.346 --> 1:16:00.723
I'm going to take a look.

1:16:02.308 --> 1:16:03.768
Chief, my mission's got priority here.

1:16:03.851 --> 1:16:06.896
Hell, you wouldn't even be in this part
of the river, if it wasn't for me.

1:16:07.313 --> 1:16:10.316
Until we reach your destination, Captain,
you're just on for the ride.

1:16:11.317 --> 1:16:12.610
[Chief] Stand by, Lance.

1:16:12.693 --> 1:16:14.361
[Chef] Come on, throw the rope! Asshole.

1:16:14.445 --> 1:16:16.697
[Chief] All right, come on.
Let's bring it over.

1:16:19.492 --> 1:16:22.369
[ducks quacking]

1:16:30.628 --> 1:16:33.297
Look in that forward hooch.
Bring the people out of there.

1:16:33.714 --> 1:16:34.840
[Chef] ID?

1:16:36.092 --> 1:16:39.011
[Chef speaking Vietnamese]

1:16:40.137 --> 1:16:42.723
Come on. Hurry up, motherfucker!
Move it! Can couc!

1:16:42.848 --> 1:16:44.767
[man speaking Vietnamese]

1:16:44.934 --> 1:16:46.811
-You too!
-Keep your eyes open, Clean.

1:16:47.478 --> 1:16:48.604
I got you, Chief.

1:16:53.317 --> 1:16:55.486
[pigs oinking]

1:17:02.201 --> 1:17:04.286
[Chef] That's them.
That's them, they're okay.

1:17:04.411 --> 1:17:05.287
Board and search it.

1:17:06.497 --> 1:17:08.457
That's the fucking boat,
ain't nothing on it, Chief.

1:17:08.541 --> 1:17:09.667
Board it and search it.

1:17:10.042 --> 1:17:11.085
Just baskets and ducks.

1:17:11.460 --> 1:17:13.629
Fucking bananas. Ain't nothing on it.

1:17:13.754 --> 1:17:16.090
Shit, Chef, what's wrong with you?
Go ahead and search it.

1:17:16.173 --> 1:17:18.008
Just a goat and some fish.

1:17:18.467 --> 1:17:20.386
-Chef--
-Bunch of fuckin' veg, there's nothing--

1:17:20.469 --> 1:17:21.470
Get on that boat!

1:17:21.637 --> 1:17:24.056
-There's nothing on it, man! All right!
-Get on it!

1:17:24.765 --> 1:17:27.059
[Chef] Move it, asshole!
Move it, God damn it!

1:17:27.560 --> 1:17:29.645
Pigs. Look. Mangoes.

1:17:29.728 --> 1:17:31.230
[Chief] What's in the rice bag?

1:17:31.355 --> 1:17:32.231
Fucking rice.

1:17:32.314 --> 1:17:33.816
Well, look in there, Chef,
look in it!

1:17:33.899 --> 1:17:36.610
[Chef] Fucking fish. More coconuts.

1:17:36.902 --> 1:17:38.445
Rice. Here's rice.

1:17:39.989 --> 1:17:41.282
What's in that vegetable basket?

1:17:41.448 --> 1:17:43.200
Get out of here! Come on.

1:17:43.284 --> 1:17:44.660
-[screams]
-Get over there, God damn it!

1:17:44.952 --> 1:17:47.246
-Chef, check that vegetable basket.
-[Chef] All right!

1:17:47.329 --> 1:17:48.289
Shut up, slope.

1:17:48.414 --> 1:17:49.498
There ain't nothing in here!

1:17:49.623 --> 1:17:51.500
-[Chief] What's in the boxes?
-Nothing.

1:17:51.667 --> 1:17:53.669
-Look in that tin can. That rusty can.
-[Chef] Nothing!

1:17:53.794 --> 1:17:55.462
Just fucking rice! That's all!

1:17:55.546 --> 1:17:57.590
[Chief] Check the yellow can.
Check the yellow can.

1:17:57.756 --> 1:17:59.508
-She was sitting on it. What's in it?
-Nothing!

1:17:59.800 --> 1:18:02.636
[machine gun fire]

1:18:03.220 --> 1:18:04.221
Chef!

1:18:07.183 --> 1:18:11.061
[Lance] Motherfuckers! Motherfuckers!

1:18:14.064 --> 1:18:17.234
Motherfuckers! Cock-suckers!

1:18:19.820 --> 1:18:22.281
[Chef] Come on! Let's kill them all!
Huh, idiots?

1:18:22.364 --> 1:18:23.657
Fucking cock-sucking mothers!

1:18:23.824 --> 1:18:24.950
Hold it! Hold it!

1:18:25.075 --> 1:18:27.912
Let's kill all the assholes. Let's shoot
the shit out of all of them, huh!

1:18:28.037 --> 1:18:30.873
-[Phillips] Hold it!
-[Chef] Why not? Jesus Christ!

1:18:31.457 --> 1:18:33.417
[Chef crying]
Why the fuck not?

1:18:35.252 --> 1:18:36.795
-[Chief] Clean?
-I'm good.

1:18:45.346 --> 1:18:47.264
-[Phillips] You Okay, Lance?
-[Chef] Fucking shit!

1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:49.934
Look what she was hiding, huh?

1:18:50.100 --> 1:18:51.060
[Chief] You all right?

1:18:51.352 --> 1:18:52.895
See what she was running for?

1:18:53.687 --> 1:18:55.648
[Chef laughs manically]

1:18:56.565 --> 1:18:58.192
It's a fucking puppy.

1:18:59.318 --> 1:19:00.819
It's a fucking puppy.

1:19:02.238 --> 1:19:03.280
Give me that dog!

1:19:03.405 --> 1:19:05.324
-Give me that dog!
-No! You're not gonna get it!

1:19:05.407 --> 1:19:08.327
-Fucking give it to me!
-No! Give me the fucking dog, asshole!

1:19:08.410 --> 1:19:09.578
Fuck you!

1:19:10.829 --> 1:19:12.331
Take the fucking mango, too!

1:19:12.414 --> 1:19:13.916
-Chef!
-You want that?

1:19:13.999 --> 1:19:16.252
Chef, she's moving behind you.
She's alive. Check her out.

1:19:16.502 --> 1:19:17.419
[Chef] Fucking--

1:19:17.503 --> 1:19:20.005
Chef! She's moving behind you!
Check her out!

1:19:20.214 --> 1:19:21.674
[Chef] All right. All right.

1:19:21.966 --> 1:19:24.051
Come on, Clean. Give me a hand.

1:19:24.260 --> 1:19:25.344
Clean, give him a hand.

1:19:25.427 --> 1:19:26.512
[Chef] Fucking...

1:19:27.054 --> 1:19:28.973
[Chief] Hey, take it easy.
Take it easy.

1:19:29.723 --> 1:19:32.393
Slow down and take it easy.
Calm down.

1:19:32.643 --> 1:19:34.353
[Clean] Wait a minute, Chef,
bring her up here.

1:19:34.478 --> 1:19:36.605
-[Chief] Is she breathing, chef?
-[Chef] She's hurt.

1:19:37.439 --> 1:19:38.440
She's bleeding.

1:19:38.607 --> 1:19:40.693
Bring her on board.
We're taking her to an ARVIN

1:19:41.485 --> 1:19:42.695
What are you talking about?

1:19:42.987 --> 1:19:45.990
We're taking her to some friendlies,
Captain. She's wounded. She's not dead.

1:19:46.573 --> 1:19:47.700
Get out of there, Chef.

1:19:47.783 --> 1:19:49.118
-[Phillips] The book says, Captain--
-[gunshot]

1:19:49.368 --> 1:19:50.244
[Chef screams]

1:19:56.417 --> 1:19:58.711
[Chef cries]

1:19:59.753 --> 1:20:02.089
Fuck you. Fuck them.

1:20:02.589 --> 1:20:04.550
I told you not to stop. Now, let's go.

1:20:05.467 --> 1:20:07.261
[bird caws]

1:21:05.861 --> 1:21:08.572
[Willard] It was a way we had over here
of living with ourselves.

1:21:09.948 --> 1:21:12.868
We'd cut them in half with a machine gun
and give them a band-aid.

1:21:15.579 --> 1:21:16.580
It was a lie.

1:21:17.915 --> 1:21:19.458
And the more I saw of them,

1:21:20.626 --> 1:21:22.419
the more I hated lies.

1:21:24.838 --> 1:21:27.716
Those boys were never gonna look
at me the same way again,

1:21:29.551 --> 1:21:33.430
but I felt like I knew one or two things
about Kurtz that weren't in the dossier.

1:21:35.891 --> 1:21:38.394
[explosion]

1:21:39.478 --> 1:21:43.023
Do Lung bridge was the last army outpost
on the Nung River.

1:21:45.067 --> 1:21:46.443
[explosion]

1:21:47.945 --> 1:21:49.738
Beyond it, there was only Kurtz.

1:21:52.282 --> 1:21:53.283
[Chef] Lance.

1:21:53.742 --> 1:21:55.994
Hey, Lance, what do you think?

1:21:56.620 --> 1:21:57.663
It's beautiful.

1:21:58.497 --> 1:22:02.292
Huh? I mean, what's the matter with you?
You're acting kind of weird.

1:22:03.544 --> 1:22:06.130
Hey, you know that last tab
of acid I was saving?

1:22:06.422 --> 1:22:07.339
Yeah.

1:22:08.048 --> 1:22:08.966
[Lance] I dropped it.

1:22:09.133 --> 1:22:10.134
[Chef] You dropped acid?

1:22:10.551 --> 1:22:11.760
Far out.

1:22:13.929 --> 1:22:15.639
[soldier] Hey, friendly!

1:22:15.722 --> 1:22:17.307
[soldiers] Friendly! Friendly!

1:22:18.809 --> 1:22:22.354
[soldiers shouting]

1:22:23.564 --> 1:22:26.900
[soldier] Take me home! God damn it!

1:22:26.984 --> 1:22:29.945
Fucking shore police! Shit!
You want to die?

1:22:30.070 --> 1:22:31.864
[soldier] Take me home!

1:22:32.448 --> 1:22:34.450
[soldier 2] Motherfuckers!

1:22:34.533 --> 1:22:36.201
[soldier 3] Hey! You fucking police!

1:22:36.285 --> 1:22:38.912
-[soldier 4] Don't leave me!
-[soldier 5] Fuck you!

1:22:39.079 --> 1:22:41.123
You'll get what you deserve!

1:22:41.874 --> 1:22:44.293
[soldiers shouting]

1:22:49.131 --> 1:22:51.967
[Carlson]
Is there a Captain Willard on board?

1:22:52.050 --> 1:22:52.926
[Willard] Yeah.

1:22:53.010 --> 1:22:54.761
-[Carlson] Captain Willard?
-Yeah, who's that?

1:22:54.928 --> 1:22:57.890
Lieutenant Carlson, sir.
Get that light off me!

1:22:59.641 --> 1:23:02.436
I was sent here from Nha Trang with these
three days ago, sir.

1:23:02.603 --> 1:23:05.397
Expected you here a little sooner.
This is mail for the boat.

1:23:06.273 --> 1:23:08.025
You don't know how happy
this makes me, sir.

1:23:08.150 --> 1:23:09.902
-Why?
-Now I can get out of here,

1:23:09.985 --> 1:23:11.195
if I can find a way.

1:23:13.071 --> 1:23:15.199
[explosion]

1:23:15.491 --> 1:23:18.118
You're in the asshole of the world,
Captain!

1:23:23.081 --> 1:23:24.374
Captain, where you going?

1:23:24.708 --> 1:23:27.419
I gotta find somebody.
I need some information.

1:23:29.046 --> 1:23:30.756
Pick me up the other side of the bridge.

1:23:30.881 --> 1:23:32.799
Somebody go with him. Chef.

1:23:33.091 --> 1:23:33.967
[Lance] I'll go.

1:23:34.968 --> 1:23:36.845
-I want to go.
-[explosion]

1:23:39.932 --> 1:23:41.266

[soldiers shouting]

1:23:49.566 --> 1:23:52.152
[soldier over speakerphone]
Contact, will you get your ass in gear?

1:23:54.321 --> 1:23:57.157
[indistinct speakerphone announcement]

1:23:57.991 --> 1:24:00.369

1:24:19.972 --> 1:24:21.431
[soldiers screaming]

1:24:28.981 --> 1:24:31.191
[Lance] Man, listen to the music, man.

1:24:31.692 --> 1:24:33.360
[Willard] Where can I find the CO?

1:24:33.443 --> 1:24:35.654
[soldier] You came right to it,
son of a bitch!

1:24:35.737 --> 1:24:38.824
[Willard] Lance! Get down here!

1:24:41.994 --> 1:24:43.954
[Willard] You still got
a commanding officer here?

1:24:44.830 --> 1:24:45.914
[soldier] Beverly Hills.

1:24:46.206 --> 1:24:47.124
[Willard] What?

1:24:47.457 --> 1:24:48.750
[soldier] Straight up the road,

1:24:48.875 --> 1:24:52.004
there's a concrete fucking bunker
called Beverly Hills.

1:24:52.421 --> 1:24:54.840
Where the fuck else
do you think it would be?

1:24:54.965 --> 1:24:57.009
[soldier 2] I don't want to die.

1:25:00.887 --> 1:25:04.349

1:25:30.292 --> 1:25:32.169
[soldier 3] God damn it!
You stepped in my face.

1:25:32.336 --> 1:25:34.963
-[Lance] Thought you were dead.
-[soldier 3] You thought wrong, damn it.

1:25:36.465 --> 1:25:38.800
[machine gun fire]

1:25:39.009 --> 1:25:41.094
[gunner] I told you to stop
fucking with me! Didn't I?

1:25:41.178 --> 1:25:42.596
Think you're so bad, huh, nigga?

1:25:42.804 --> 1:25:44.931
-[machine gun fire]
-What are you shooting at, soldier?

1:25:45.015 --> 1:25:47.142
Gooks, man. What the fuck
do you think I'm shootin' at?

1:25:47.476 --> 1:25:50.145
I’m sorry, sir.
There are gooks out there by the wire.

1:25:50.437 --> 1:25:51.772
But I think I killed them all.

1:25:51.938 --> 1:25:53.982
You ain't shot shit, man.
Listen.

[gunner] You think you so bad, nigga?
You think you bad, huh?

1:26:10.207 --> 1:26:13.251
They're all dead, stupid.
There's one alive underneath them bodies.

1:26:14.211 --> 1:26:15.921
Who's the commanding officer here?

1:26:16.546 --> 1:26:17.589
Ain't you?

1:26:18.298 --> 1:26:19.174
[gunshot]

1:26:20.384 --> 1:26:22.636
-You think you so bad, huh?
-[machine gun fire]

1:26:22.719 --> 1:26:25.847
I got something for your ass now, nigga!
I got something for you now! [laughs]

1:26:28.225 --> 1:26:29.935
[spotter] He's underneath the bodies,
man.

1:26:30.102 --> 1:26:31.269
[explosion]

1:26:33.271 --> 1:26:35.482
Go get the roach, man.
Go get the roach, nigga!

1:26:36.066 --> 1:26:38.110
-[spotter] I'll get the roach.
-[gunner] Go get him.

1:26:38.860 --> 1:26:41.488
[rock music playing]

1:26:42.114 --> 1:26:43.115
[spotter] Roach.

1:26:43.490 --> 1:26:44.574
Roach.

1:26:44.908 --> 1:26:45.826
Roach.

1:26:46.576 --> 1:26:48.745
You got slopes on the wire, man
You hear 'em?

1:26:49.204 --> 1:26:50.122
Lance!

1:26:50.330 --> 1:26:51.498
[spotter] Do you hear them?

1:26:52.666 --> 1:26:56.253
[Viet Cong yelling]

1:26:56.503 --> 1:26:57.504
Well, bust him.

1:27:00.841 --> 1:27:03.301
[Viet Cong] Hey, GIs! Fuck you!

1:27:07.514 --> 1:27:08.390
[music stops]

1:27:09.224 --> 1:27:10.684
[distant explosions]

1:27:10.851 --> 1:27:13.061
[Viet Cong yelling]

1:27:13.186 --> 1:27:15.147
[gunner] You hear him out there
on the wire, man?

1:27:16.273 --> 1:27:17.399
Yeah.

1:27:18.024 --> 1:27:19.818
[Viet Cong] I'll kill you, GIs!

1:27:20.152 --> 1:27:21.153
You need a flare?

1:27:21.653 --> 1:27:22.529
[gunshots]

1:27:22.988 --> 1:27:23.864
No.

1:27:25.407 --> 1:27:26.783
He's close, man.

1:27:27.951 --> 1:27:29.619
He's real close.

1:27:37.586 --> 1:27:40.714
[Viet Cong yelling]

1:27:51.975 --> 1:27:54.019
[Viet Cong] GIs, fuck you!

1:27:55.479 --> 1:27:56.938
GIs!

1:27:57.606 --> 1:27:59.941
-GIs! Fuck y--
-[explosion]

1:28:04.321 --> 1:28:05.447
Motherfucker.

1:28:06.907 --> 1:28:07.824
[Willard] Hey, soldier.

1:28:12.788 --> 1:28:14.456
Do you know who's in command here?

1:28:17.459 --> 1:28:18.335
Yeah.

1:28:23.715 --> 1:28:24.800
[distant gunshots]

1:28:29.471 --> 1:28:30.472
[explosion]

1:28:30.597 --> 1:28:32.224
[soldier screaming]

1:28:32.849 --> 1:28:35.018
Holy shit.

1:28:35.185 --> 1:28:36.645
[explosion]

1:28:40.148 --> 1:28:42.984
Chief, two guys just got blown off that
bridge.

1:28:43.109 --> 1:28:45.362
You hang on, man. You're going to be okay.

1:28:48.824 --> 1:28:49.699
[explosion]

1:28:49.991 --> 1:28:50.951
[Clean] What's that?

1:28:51.034 --> 1:28:51.952
[Chef] Mail, man.

1:28:52.035 --> 1:28:54.037
Later on the mail. Watch them trees.

1:28:56.581 --> 1:28:58.917
There's no diesel fuel,
but I picked up some ammo.

1:28:59.501 --> 1:29:00.502
Let's move out.

1:29:01.419 --> 1:29:02.879
Did you find the CO, Captain?

1:29:02.963 --> 1:29:04.631
[Willard] There's no fucking CO here.

1:29:07.217 --> 1:29:08.718
Let's just get going.

1:29:09.386 --> 1:29:10.387
Which way, Captain?

1:29:16.685 --> 1:29:18.019
You know which way, Chief.

1:29:19.729 --> 1:29:21.189
You're on your own, Captain.

1:29:23.149 --> 1:29:24.317
Still want to go on?

1:29:25.151 --> 1:29:28.780
Like this bridge, we build it every night,
Charlie blows it right back up again.

1:29:29.197 --> 1:29:31.449
Just so the generals can say
the road's open.

1:29:32.409 --> 1:29:33.285
Think about it.

1:29:36.872 --> 1:29:38.790
-Who cares?
-Just get us upriver!

1:29:44.004 --> 1:29:46.089
Chef. On the bow.

1:29:47.591 --> 1:29:48.758
Stand by, Clean.

1:29:48.842 --> 1:29:49.718
[Chef] Let's go!

1:29:57.851 --> 1:30:00.896
[explosions]

1:30:04.149 --> 1:30:05.483
[explosion]

1:30:12.115 --> 1:30:13.116
[explosion]

1:30:46.274 --> 1:30:47.525
[Clean] Whose package is that?

1:30:47.776 --> 1:30:49.235
Shit, you got another one, Clean.

1:30:49.402 --> 1:30:51.613
No shit. Wait a minute, is that it?

1:30:52.322 --> 1:30:54.240
That's it for you. Lance!

1:30:54.783 --> 1:30:56.826
Mr. L.B. Johnson. There you go.

1:30:58.662 --> 1:31:01.289
Far out, man. All right!
I've been waiting for this one.

1:31:02.040 --> 1:31:05.001
[Chef] I got another one.
I got a box from Eva.

1:31:05.335 --> 1:31:10.090
[Lance] "Lance, I'm fine.
Sue and I went tripping in Disney Land.

1:31:10.465 --> 1:31:11.716
Sue skinned her knee."

1:31:12.008 --> 1:31:13.969
[Chef]
Man, I I'm gonna get back to Antoine's.

1:31:14.052 --> 1:31:16.680
[Lance] Course I remember the time,
how could I fucking forget, man?

1:31:16.763 --> 1:31:17.847
Beautiful!

1:31:18.932 --> 1:31:21.518
"There could never be
a place like Disneyland, or could there?

1:31:21.601 --> 1:31:22.560
Let me know."

1:31:22.852 --> 1:31:26.189
Jim, it's here. It really is here.

1:31:30.735 --> 1:31:33.279
[Willard] "There has been
a new development regarding your mission

1:31:33.363 --> 1:31:35.115
which we must now communicate to you.

1:31:35.699 --> 1:31:38.952
Months ago, a man was ordered on a
mission which was identical to yours.

1:31:40.036 --> 1:31:43.331
We have reason to believe that he is
now operating with Colonel Kurtz.

1:31:45.458 --> 1:31:48.336
Saigon was carrying him MIA
for his family's sake,

1:31:49.295 --> 1:31:50.630
but they assumed he was dead.

1:31:51.673 --> 1:31:54.342
Then they intercepted a letter
he tried to send to his wife."

1:31:59.055 --> 1:32:00.181
Captain Richard Colby.

1:32:03.059 --> 1:32:04.185
He was with Kurtz.

1:32:04.310 --> 1:32:05.311
[Lance] Look at this guy!

1:32:06.146 --> 1:32:07.397
Disneyland.

1:32:08.356 --> 1:32:10.525
Fuck, man, this is better than Disneyland.

1:32:11.234 --> 1:32:15.822
[Chef] "Charles Miller Manson ordered
the slaughter of all in the home anyway

1:32:15.947 --> 1:32:17.323
as a symbol of protest."

1:32:17.449 --> 1:32:19.534
-That's really weird, ain't it?
-[flare popping]

1:32:20.160 --> 1:32:23.329
-Purple haze. Look.
-[Chief] Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.

1:32:23.413 --> 1:32:24.831
[Clean] I got a tape from my mom.

1:32:24.914 --> 1:32:29.127
Chief, rainbow reality, man.
Hey, chief, get a good whiff.

1:32:29.586 --> 1:32:32.005
[Chef] Eva can't picture me in Vietnam.

1:32:33.173 --> 1:32:37.010
She pictures me at home
having a beer, watching TV. [laughs]

1:32:38.011 --> 1:32:39.012
Hey, Lance, man.

1:32:39.471 --> 1:32:41.139
Ooh! Hot potato! Hot potato!

1:32:42.098 --> 1:32:44.476
[Clean's mother on tape]
I'm so glad you decided to join the...

1:32:44.684 --> 1:32:47.353
[Chef] Eva's not sure she could have
a relationship with me, you know.

1:32:47.479 --> 1:32:50.607
[laughs] Here I am,
13,000 fucking miles away,

1:32:50.690 --> 1:32:53.109
trying to keep a relationship up
with my ass.

1:32:54.027 --> 1:32:55.987
[Clean's mother]
...that's much more than I can say

1:32:56.071 --> 1:32:57.405
for some of your friends.

1:32:57.989 --> 1:32:59.824
If this tape is any good,

1:33:00.116 --> 1:33:02.702
I will have Dad and the family
send you a tape

1:33:02.786 --> 1:33:04.204
-...of their own.
-[Chef] Hey, Lance.

1:33:26.768 --> 1:33:27.685
[Chef] Damn it!

Captain, he's hit, he's hit!
Clean's hit!

1:33:56.172 --> 1:33:57.882
Where'd the dog go?

1:33:58.133 --> 1:34:00.927
[Chief] Lance! Lance, check out Clean!

1:34:01.344 --> 1:34:04.305
Where's the dog?
We got to go back and get the dog!

1:34:04.597 --> 1:34:05.640
Hey, Clean!

1:34:05.723 --> 1:34:08.434
[Clean's mother]
It's always been my dream to have a boy...

1:34:08.518 --> 1:34:09.853
Hey, Bubber!

1:34:10.436 --> 1:34:12.981
Bubber, you can't die, you fucker!

1:34:14.691 --> 1:34:16.151
Hey, Bubber!
[cries]

1:34:16.401 --> 1:34:20.905
[Clean's mother] ...I'm hoping that
pretty soon, not too soon,

1:34:21.447 --> 1:34:25.660
but pretty soon, I'll have a lot
of grandchildren to love and spoil.

1:34:26.411 --> 1:34:30.623
Then when your wife gets them back,
she'll be mad with me. Ha ha ha.

1:34:31.916 --> 1:34:37.213
Even Aunt Jessie and Mama will come
to celebrate your coming home.

1:34:37.755 --> 1:34:41.050
Granny and Dad are trying to get
enough money to get you a car,

1:34:41.426 --> 1:34:44.637
but don't tell them
because that's our secret.

1:34:46.264 --> 1:34:48.516
Anyhow, do the right thing,

1:34:49.225 --> 1:34:50.852
stay out of the way of the bullets,

1:34:51.603 --> 1:34:55.315
and bring your heinie home
all in one piece,

1:34:55.815 --> 1:34:57.400
because we love you very much.

1:34:58.234 --> 1:34:59.652
Love, Mom.

1:36:48.136 --> 1:36:50.596
[Chief] Can't see nothing.
We're stopping.

1:36:51.139 --> 1:36:53.349
[Willard] You're not authorized
to stop this boat, Chief.

1:36:53.558 --> 1:36:56.769
[Chief] I said I can't see a thing,
Captain. I'm stopping this boat.

1:36:57.145 --> 1:36:58.771
I ain't risking no more lives.

1:36:58.896 --> 1:37:01.357
[Willard] I'm in command here,
God damn it. You'll do what I say.

1:37:01.733 --> 1:37:03.526
[howling noise]

1:37:03.943 --> 1:37:05.320
[Chief] You see anything, Chef?

1:37:05.611 --> 1:37:07.030
[howling noise]

1:37:08.072 --> 1:37:10.158
Why don't they fucking attack, man?

1:37:10.783 --> 1:37:12.744
[Lance howling]

1:37:13.953 --> 1:37:16.956
[Lance howling]

1:37:29.552 --> 1:37:31.137
[Chef] Watch it over here, Chief!

1:37:32.889 --> 1:37:34.057
Gotta stoop.

1:37:36.559 --> 1:37:38.144
Lance, on the 50s.

1:37:39.145 --> 1:37:40.188
[Willard] He was close.

1:37:42.857 --> 1:37:44.525
He was real close.

1:37:46.986 --> 1:37:48.946
I couldn't see him yet,
but I could feel him,

1:37:49.906 --> 1:37:51.783
as if the boat were being sucked upriver

1:37:51.866 --> 1:37:54.077
and the water was flowing
back into the jungle.

1:37:57.330 --> 1:37:58.873
Whatever was going to happen,

1:37:59.832 --> 1:38:02.710
it wouldn't be the way they called it
back in Nha Trang.

1:38:07.423 --> 1:38:08.466
[arrows whistling]

1:38:08.549 --> 1:38:09.425
Arrows!

1:38:11.511 --> 1:38:12.553
[arrows whistling]

1:38:13.346 --> 1:38:15.264
Chef, open up fire!

1:38:15.765 --> 1:38:17.392

Chef!

1:38:30.822 --> 1:38:32.615
Chef, it's okay! Quit firing!

-Cut it out! Quiet!
-[machine gun fire]

1:38:37.286 --> 1:38:39.539
Chief, tell them to hold their fire!

1:38:39.664 --> 1:38:42.333
They're just little sticks,
they're just trying to scare us.

1:38:42.458 --> 1:38:44.836
-[machine gun fire]
-Quiet!

1:38:45.086 --> 1:38:47.672
You got us into this mess
and now you can't get us out,

1:38:47.755 --> 1:38:49.841
because you don't know where the hell
you going, do ya?

1:38:50.425 --> 1:38:51.342
Do ya?

1:38:52.343 --> 1:38:55.179
-[machine gun fire]
-You son of a bitch! You bastard!

1:38:55.972 --> 1:38:57.348

A spear?

1:40:05.082 --> 1:40:06.125
[Willard pants]

1:40:45.331 --> 1:40:47.583
[Willard] My mission is to make it
up into Cambodia.

1:40:48.668 --> 1:40:51.045
There's a Green Beret colonel up there
who's gone insane.

1:40:51.128 --> 1:40:52.380
I'm supposed to kill him.

1:40:54.507 --> 1:40:55.967
That's fucking typical.

1:40:56.467 --> 1:40:59.262
Shit! Fucking Vietnam mission.

1:40:59.762 --> 1:41:02.932
I'm short, and we got to go up there
so you can kill one of our own guys.

1:41:03.641 --> 1:41:04.934
That's fucking great!

1:41:05.268 --> 1:41:07.061
That's just fucking great, man!

1:41:08.396 --> 1:41:11.274
Shit! That's fucking crazy!

1:41:11.691 --> 1:41:14.527
I mean, I thought you were going in
to blow up a bridge

1:41:14.860 --> 1:41:17.613
or some fucking railroad tracks
or something.

1:41:18.531 --> 1:41:19.407
Sorry.

1:41:19.574 --> 1:41:22.577
No. No, wait, wait.
We'll go together on the boat.

1:41:22.785 --> 1:41:23.744
We'll go with you.

1:41:24.161 --> 1:41:25.997
We'll go up there, but on the boat.

1:41:27.123 --> 1:41:28.040
Okay?

1:42:34.774 --> 1:42:36.942
[Willard] Part of me was afraid
of what I would find

1:42:37.026 --> 1:42:38.736
and what I would do when I got there.

1:42:41.864 --> 1:42:43.157
I knew the risks...

1:42:44.784 --> 1:42:46.243
or imagined I knew.

1:42:48.913 --> 1:42:50.498
But the thing I felt the most,

1:42:51.540 --> 1:42:53.209
much stronger than fear,

1:42:54.669 --> 1:42:56.796
was the desire to confront him.

1:44:09.410 --> 1:44:10.745
Just keep moving.

1:44:11.537 --> 1:44:14.999
Lance, keep your hands away from the guns.

1:45:39.625 --> 1:45:41.752
[tin drums playing]

1:45:41.877 --> 1:45:43.754
[photographer]
It's all right! It's all right!

1:45:43.838 --> 1:45:45.464
It's all been approved!

1:45:46.131 --> 1:45:47.550
I ain't coming in there!

1:45:48.008 --> 1:45:49.385
Them bastards attacked us!

1:45:50.094 --> 1:45:52.471
[photographer]
Come on! Zap them with your siren, man!

1:45:52.555 --> 1:45:54.056
Zap them with your siren!

1:45:56.016 --> 1:46:00.271
[siren sounds]

1:46:04.483 --> 1:46:06.694
There's mines over there
and mines over there, too!

1:46:06.861 --> 1:46:09.238
And watch out. Those God damn monkeys bite
you, I'll tell you.

1:46:09.864 --> 1:46:12.491
Wow. That's a pretty one.
Move it right in toward me.

1:46:13.659 --> 1:46:17.621
I'm an American.
Yeah! I'm an American civilian. Hi, Yanks.

1:46:18.497 --> 1:46:19.915
Hi. American.

1:46:20.457 --> 1:46:22.001
American civilian. It's all right.

1:46:22.793 --> 1:46:25.379
And you've got the cigarettes
and that's what I've been dreaming of.

1:46:26.714 --> 1:46:27.590
Chef...

1:46:28.465 --> 1:46:29.425
Who are you?

1:46:30.384 --> 1:46:34.221
Who are you? [laughs]

1:46:35.389 --> 1:46:37.057
I'm a photojournalist.

1:46:37.766 --> 1:46:39.560
I've covered the war since '64.

1:46:40.144 --> 1:46:42.146
I've been in Laos, Cambodia, Nam.

1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:45.065
A-phew-wee!

1:46:45.691 --> 1:46:46.859
Phew-wee, baby!

1:46:47.526 --> 1:46:50.696
I'll tell you one thing.
This boat is a mess, man. Woo.

1:46:51.071 --> 1:46:52.323
Who are all these people?

1:46:52.573 --> 1:46:55.200
Yeah, well,
they think you've come to, uh...

1:46:56.619 --> 1:46:58.996
To take him away
and I hope that isn't true.

1:46:59.830 --> 1:47:00.873
Take who away?

1:47:03.042 --> 1:47:03.959
Him!

1:47:04.793 --> 1:47:05.878
Colonel Kurtz.

1:47:06.712 --> 1:47:09.673
These are all his children,
man, as far as you can see.

1:47:10.758 --> 1:47:13.469
Hell, man, out here,
we're all his children.

1:47:14.345 --> 1:47:17.640
Could we, uh, talk to Colonel Kurtz?

1:47:18.098 --> 1:47:21.352
Hey, man, you don't talk to the colonel.

1:47:22.436 --> 1:47:23.938
Well-- Well, you listen to him.

1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:27.316
Uh... the man's enlarged my mind.

1:47:27.942 --> 1:47:31.278
He's a poet-warrior in a classic sense.

1:47:31.862 --> 1:47:34.657
I mean, sometimes,
you'll say hello to him, right,

1:47:34.782 --> 1:47:36.283
and he'll just walk right by you.

1:47:36.408 --> 1:47:38.827
He won't even notice you
and then suddenly he'll grab you,

1:47:38.911 --> 1:47:41.121
and he'll-- He'll throw you in a corner,
and he'll say,

1:47:41.246 --> 1:47:43.290
"Do you know that "if"
is the middle word in life?"

1:47:43.374 --> 1:47:45.501
If you can keep your head
when all about you are losing theirs

1:47:45.584 --> 1:47:47.628
and blaming it on you, if you can
trust yourself when all men doubt you,"

1:47:47.711 --> 1:47:51.966
I mean, I know I can't-- I'm a little man.
I'ma little man. He's a great man.

1:47:52.257 --> 1:47:55.260
Uh, I should have been
a pair of ragged claws,

1:47:55.469 --> 1:47:58.097
uh, scuttling across floors
of silent seas.

1:47:58.180 --> 1:47:59.515
-I mean, uh--
-Stay with the boat.

1:47:59.682 --> 1:48:02.184
Don't go any-- Don't go without me, okay?

1:48:02.851 --> 1:48:04.144
I want to get a picture.

1:48:06.814 --> 1:48:09.441
He can be terrible,
and he can be mean...

1:48:09.566 --> 1:48:11.443
-[camera clicks]
-...and he can be right.

1:48:12.236 --> 1:48:13.529
He's fighting the war.

1:48:14.405 --> 1:48:15.656
He's a great man.

1:48:16.115 --> 1:48:17.032
[camera clicks]

1:48:17.366 --> 1:48:19.410
[laughs] I mean...

1:48:22.997 --> 1:48:24.623
I wish I had words, man.

1:48:25.541 --> 1:48:26.500
I wish I had words.

1:48:26.667 --> 1:48:29.545
I can tell you something,
like the other day, he wanted to kill me.

1:48:29.837 --> 1:48:30.879
Something like that.

1:48:31.130 --> 1:48:32.423
Why did he want to kill you?

1:48:32.589 --> 1:48:34.216
[laughs]
Because I took his picture.

1:48:35.342 --> 1:48:37.469
He said, "If you take my picture again,

1:48:39.013 --> 1:48:39.930
I'm going to kill you."

1:48:41.348 --> 1:48:42.725
And he meant it.

1:48:45.394 --> 1:48:47.771
So you just lay cool, play it cool.

1:48:48.063 --> 1:48:49.398
Lay back, dig it?

1:48:49.982 --> 1:48:51.859
He gets friendly again. He really does.

1:48:53.277 --> 1:48:55.988
But, uh, you don't--
You don't judge the colonel.

1:48:56.822 --> 1:48:58.782
You don't judge the colonel
like an ordinary man.

1:48:59.324 --> 1:49:01.452
[birds cawing]

1:49:04.413 --> 1:49:05.372
[photographer whistles]

1:49:05.539 --> 1:49:08.792
Okay, watch it now.
These are Americans! Americans!

1:49:09.209 --> 1:49:10.878
Feel the vibe of this place.

1:49:11.420 --> 1:49:12.546
Let me take your picture.

1:49:13.005 --> 1:49:15.966
Hey, could you-- Hello?
Hello? Could you hold it a minute?

1:49:18.844 --> 1:49:21.221
[camera shutter clicks repeatedly]

1:49:38.989 --> 1:49:40.157
[Willard] Colby.

1:49:56.507 --> 1:49:57.633
[photographer] The heads...

1:49:58.884 --> 1:50:00.385
You're looking at the heads.

1:50:00.803 --> 1:50:04.014
Hey, sometimes he goes too far.

1:50:05.057 --> 1:50:06.433
He's the first one to admit it.

1:50:07.851 --> 1:50:08.936
[Chef] He's gone crazy.

1:50:09.061 --> 1:50:10.187
Wrong! Wrong!

1:50:12.189 --> 1:50:14.900
If you could have heard the man
just two days ago...

1:50:15.025 --> 1:50:16.944
If you could have heard him then, God...

1:50:17.903 --> 1:50:19.655
You're gonna call him crazy?

1:50:20.405 --> 1:50:21.281
Fuckin' A.

1:50:22.950 --> 1:50:24.451
I just want to talk to him.

1:50:26.870 --> 1:50:28.497
Well, man, he's gone away.

1:50:30.207 --> 1:50:32.793
He's gone away, disappeared
out in the jungle with his people.

1:50:32.876 --> 1:50:33.794
I'll wait for him.

1:50:33.877 --> 1:50:35.754
He feels comfortable with his people.

1:50:36.505 --> 1:50:38.382
He forgets himself with his people.

1:50:40.551 --> 1:50:41.885
He forgets himself.

1:50:42.136 --> 1:50:45.013
Captain.
Maybe we should wait back at the boat.

1:50:46.348 --> 1:50:47.891
-I think--
-[Willard] Okay, Chef.

1:50:48.308 --> 1:50:50.060
We'll go back to the boat for a while.

1:50:50.477 --> 1:50:52.813
Yeah. Stay with Lance.

1:51:03.157 --> 1:51:07.161
[chopping tree]

1:51:14.585 --> 1:51:15.586
[splash]

1:51:16.170 --> 1:51:18.547
[Chef]
This colonel guy, he's wacko, man.

1:51:18.630 --> 1:51:20.841
He's worse than crazy, he's evil.

1:51:21.800 --> 1:51:24.094
I mean, that's what the man's got
set up here, man,

1:51:24.178 --> 1:51:26.471
it's fucking pagan idolatry!
Look around you.

1:51:27.890 --> 1:51:29.183
Shit, he's loco.

1:51:29.516 --> 1:51:30.684
[Willard] Then you'll help me?

1:51:31.143 --> 1:51:34.396
[Chef] Help you? Fuckin' A, I'll help you.
I'll do anything to get out of this joint.

1:51:35.898 --> 1:51:37.566
We could blow
all them assholes away.

1:51:37.691 --> 1:51:39.902
They're so fucking spaced out,
they wouldn't even know it.

1:51:41.195 --> 1:51:45.741
I ain't afraid of all them fucking skulls
and altars and shit.

1:51:47.784 --> 1:51:51.455
I used to think if I died
in an evil place,

1:51:51.997 --> 1:51:54.166
then my soul wouldn't be able
to make it to heaven.

1:51:55.125 --> 1:51:56.251
But now...

1:51:56.793 --> 1:51:58.045
Fuck.

1:51:59.838 --> 1:52:02.507
I mean, I don't care where it goes
as long as it ain't here.

1:52:03.091 --> 1:52:04.426
So what do you want to do?

1:52:05.010 --> 1:52:06.511
-I'll kill the fuck.
-[Willard] No, no.

1:52:06.803 --> 1:52:07.721
Get out of here.

1:52:07.804 --> 1:52:09.723
[Willard]
I'm going to need you to wait here, Chef.

1:52:10.307 --> 1:52:13.769
I'll go up with Lance, scrounge around,
check the place out,

1:52:14.436 --> 1:52:16.647
see if I can find the colonel. Okay?

1:52:17.898 --> 1:52:19.858
[Chef] Well, what do you want me to do?

1:52:19.983 --> 1:52:20.984
Damn it.

1:52:21.193 --> 1:52:23.195
Here. Here, take the radio,

1:52:24.613 --> 1:52:27.574
and if I don't get back by 22:00 hours...

1:52:30.452 --> 1:52:31.662
you'll call in the air strike.

1:52:34.164 --> 1:52:35.374
[Chef] Air strike?

1:52:37.626 --> 1:52:42.339
The code is Almighty,
coordinates 0-niner-2-6-4-7-1-2.

1:52:43.382 --> 1:52:44.508
It's all in there.

1:52:46.134 --> 1:52:49.179
[Chef] 0-niner-2-6-4-7-1-2.

1:52:57.604 --> 1:53:00.816
[Willard] Everything I saw told me
that Kurtz had gone insane.

1:53:05.028 --> 1:53:06.947
The place was full of bodies,

1:53:07.531 --> 1:53:11.326
North Vietnamese, Viet Cong, Cambodians.

1:53:18.834 --> 1:53:21.920
If I was still alive, it was
because he wanted me that way.

1:53:23.171 --> 1:53:26.883
[chanting]

1:53:32.180 --> 1:53:33.098
Hey!

1:53:39.062 --> 1:53:41.315
[Willard shouting]

1:53:47.487 --> 1:53:48.989
[Willard shouting]

1:53:56.288 --> 1:53:58.665
[Willard] It smelled like slow death
in there.

1:54:00.250 --> 1:54:01.335
Malaria.

1:54:02.419 --> 1:54:03.295
Nightmares.

1:54:06.340 --> 1:54:08.342
This was the end of the river, all right.

1:54:17.434 --> 1:54:18.560
[coughing]

1:54:22.564 --> 1:54:24.107
[Kurtz] Where are you from, Willard?

1:54:29.738 --> 1:54:31.365
[Willard] I'm from Ohio, sir.

1:54:33.533 --> 1:54:34.576
[Kurtz coughing]

1:54:37.287 --> 1:54:38.538
[Kurtz] Were you born there?

1:54:39.247 --> 1:54:40.332
[Willard] Yes, sir.

1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:43.251
[Kurtz] Whereabouts?

1:54:44.086 --> 1:54:45.253
[Willard] Toledo, sir.

1:54:52.177 --> 1:54:53.762
How far are you from the river?

1:55:00.852 --> 1:55:02.187
[Willard] The Ohio river, sir?

1:55:03.647 --> 1:55:04.523
[Kurtz] Uh-huh.

1:55:04.981 --> 1:55:06.483
[Willard] About 200 miles.

1:55:14.825 --> 1:55:17.327
[Kurtz] I went down that river once
when I was a kid.

1:55:22.582 --> 1:55:25.001
There's a place in the river,
I can't remember...

1:55:25.752 --> 1:55:30.674
Must have been a gardenia plantation
or a flower plantation at one time.

1:55:31.007 --> 1:55:33.885
It's all wild and overgrown now,

1:55:33.969 --> 1:55:36.638
but for about 5 miles,

1:55:36.721 --> 1:55:40.267
you'd think that heaven just fell
on the earth...

1:55:41.560 --> 1:55:43.562
in the form of gardenias.

1:55:59.995 --> 1:56:01.329
Have you ever considered...

1:56:03.623 --> 1:56:05.041
any real freedoms?

1:56:10.797 --> 1:56:13.717
Freedoms from the opinion
of others...

1:56:17.304 --> 1:56:19.222
even the opinions of yourself?

1:56:20.640 --> 1:56:25.896
[water dripping]

1:56:29.733 --> 1:56:32.777
[water dripping]

1:56:35.447 --> 1:56:39.034
Did they say why... Willard?

1:56:41.244 --> 1:56:45.916
Why they want to terminate my command?

1:57:01.598 --> 1:57:03.892
I was sent on a classified mission, sir.

1:57:08.104 --> 1:57:09.648
[Kurtz] It's no longer classified...

1:57:10.649 --> 1:57:11.525
is it?

1:57:18.698 --> 1:57:19.908
What did they tell you?

1:57:23.203 --> 1:57:24.496
[Willard] They told me...

1:57:25.705 --> 1:57:26.831
that you had gone...

1:57:28.416 --> 1:57:29.584
totally insane.

1:57:32.504 --> 1:57:33.630
And, uh...

1:57:34.005 --> 1:57:37.050
that your... methods were...

1:57:38.176 --> 1:57:39.052
unsound.

1:57:42.764 --> 1:57:44.599
Are my methods unsound?

1:57:50.814 --> 1:57:52.148
I don't see...

1:57:53.191 --> 1:57:54.192
any method...

1:57:56.111 --> 1:57:57.028
at all, sir.

1:58:03.910 --> 1:58:05.203
[Kurtz] I expected...

1:58:06.663 --> 1:58:07.747
someone like you.

1:58:10.917 --> 1:58:12.335
What did you expect?

1:58:20.510 --> 1:58:22.053
Are you an assassin?

1:58:27.100 --> 1:58:28.143
I'm a soldier.

1:58:32.022 --> 1:58:33.023
You're neither.

1:58:35.775 --> 1:58:37.360
You're an errand boy...

1:58:39.029 --> 1:58:40.947
sent by grocery clerks...

That's dialectic. Physics, okay?

2:07:35.690 --> 2:07:37.608
Dialectic logic is
there's only love and hate.

[Willard] On the river, I thought that
the minute I looked at him

2:08:28.618 --> 2:08:29.785
I'd know what to do.

2:08:31.454 --> 2:08:32.747
But it didn't happen.

2:08:34.624 --> 2:08:36.417

2:08:37.251 --> 2:08:38.211

2:08:39.086 --> 2:08:40.004
I was free.

2:08:41.255 --> 2:08:43.174
But he knew I wasn't going anywhere.

2:08:44.634 --> 2:08:47.303
He knew more about what I was
going to do than I did.

2:08:55.144 --> 2:08:58.481
If the generals back in Nha Trang
could see what I saw,

2:08:59.523 --> 2:09:01.234
would they still want me to kill him?

2:09:03.402 --> 2:09:04.904
More than ever, probably.

2:09:06.656 --> 2:09:08.699
And what would his people back home want

2:09:08.783 --> 2:09:11.577
if they ever learned just how far
from them he'd really gone?

2:09:14.413 --> 2:09:15.289
He broke from them,

2:09:16.374 --> 2:09:17.917
and then he broke from himself.

2:09:19.418 --> 2:09:21.754
I'd never seen a man so broken up and...

2:09:22.797 --> 2:09:23.798

2:09:24.548 --> 2:09:25.841
[Kurtz] I've seen horrors.

Horrors that you've seen.

2:09:31.389 --> 2:09:33.599

a murderer.

You have a right to do that.

2:09:40.940 --> 2:09:42.692
But you have no right to judge me.

2:09:49.949 --> 2:09:51.909
It's impossible for words...

2:09:53.828 --> 2:09:55.204

2:09:57.415 --> 2:10:00.251
what is... necessary...

2:10:02.670 --> 2:10:06.382
to those who do not know

2:10:07.800 --> 2:10:10.720
what horror means.

2:10:12.930 --> 2:10:13.848
Horror.

2:10:17.226 --> 2:10:19.729
Horror has a face...

2:10:22.356 --> 2:10:24.150
and you must make a friend of horror.

2:10:25.943 --> 2:10:30.781
Horror and moral terror are your friends.

2:10:31.490 --> 2:10:36.120
If they are not, then they are enemies to
be feared.

2:10:37.788 --> 2:10:39.165
They are truly enemies.

2:10:44.712 --> 2:10:47.506
I remember
when I was with Special Forces.

2:10:52.094 --> 2:10:55.931
Seems... a thousand centuries ago.

2:10:59.477 --> 2:11:05.316
We went into a camp
to inoculate... some children.

2:11:10.029 --> 2:11:11.280
We'd left the camp,

2:11:12.865 --> 2:11:15.618
after we had inoculated the children
for polio,

2:11:17.953 --> 2:11:21.499
and this old man came running after us,
and he was crying, he couldn't say.

2:11:24.919 --> 2:11:26.545
We went back there

2:11:27.296 --> 2:11:32.843
and they had come and hacked off
every inoculated arm.

2:11:35.304 --> 2:11:37.139
There they were in a pile,

2:11:37.723 --> 2:11:38.682
a pile of...

2:11:41.060 --> 2:11:41.936
little arms.

2:11:44.355 --> 2:11:46.690
And I remember...

2:11:48.651 --> 2:11:49.527
I-- I...

2:11:50.611 --> 2:11:53.155
I cried, I wept like...

2:11:55.282 --> 2:11:57.326
some... grandmother.

2:12:00.246 --> 2:12:03.582
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

2:12:05.292 --> 2:12:07.628
And I want to remember it,
I never want to forget it.

2:12:08.546 --> 2:12:09.922
I never want to forget.

2:12:11.966 --> 2:12:16.512
And then I realized... like I was shot,

2:12:17.096 --> 2:12:19.056
like I was shot with a diamond,

2:12:20.516 --> 2:12:23.602
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead

2:12:25.729 --> 2:12:28.774
and I thought,
"My God! The genius of that,

2:12:29.692 --> 2:12:34.697
the genius, the will to do that."

2:12:36.365 --> 2:12:41.287
Perfect, genuine, complete,
crystal and pure.

2:12:43.456 --> 2:12:49.003
Then I realized they were stronger than we
because they could stand it.

2:12:49.086 --> 2:12:53.132
These were not monsters,
these were men, trained cadres.

2:12:54.508 --> 2:12:56.927
These men fought with their hearts,

2:12:57.094 --> 2:12:59.013
who have families, who have children,

2:12:59.346 --> 2:13:00.723
who are filled with love,

2:13:01.432 --> 2:13:03.309

2:13:04.894 --> 2:13:06.228
the strength...

2:13:10.357 --> 2:13:11.484
to do that.

2:13:12.401 --> 2:13:16.864
If I had 10 divisions of those men,

2:13:17.781 --> 2:13:20.701
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly.

2:13:22.536 --> 2:13:23.787
You have to have men

2:13:26.040 --> 2:13:26.999
who are moral,

2:13:29.251 --> 2:13:30.836
and at the same time,

2:13:31.712 --> 2:13:36.592
who are able to utilize their...

2:13:39.178 --> 2:13:41.263
primordial instincts to kill,

2:13:43.098 --> 2:13:45.434
without feeling, without passion,

2:13:47.269 --> 2:13:49.813
