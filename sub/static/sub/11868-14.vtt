WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:03.204
CARTER: Previously on Eureka.

00:03.837 --> 00:05.122
JO: Stuff's been going
missing all over town.

00:05.881 --> 00:07.496
CARTER: This is
who's building it?

00:07.633 --> 00:09.965
The signal that
we've been tracking
is getting stronger.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.128
CARTER: Meaning closer?

00:11.970 --> 00:12.959
Whoa!

00:14.097 --> 00:15.086
It's not a weapon.

00:15.224 --> 00:17.089
The end point
for a high-velocity
space jump.

00:25.817 --> 00:26.852
It's one of ours.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.324
(CHATTERING ON RADIO)

00:48.840 --> 00:50.455
I didn't see
this coming.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.049
Henry did. He knew
that half the town and I
were brainwashed

00:53.178 --> 00:54.418
into building
this landing site.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.261
No, I didn't. I mean,
itnevereven
occurred to me

00:56.390 --> 00:57.800
that the ship
still existed,

00:57.933 --> 00:59.889
much less that
it could find
its way back.

01:00.018 --> 01:03.055
From where?
And who built this thing?

01:03.939 --> 01:06.180
I did. 20 years ago.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.978
It's the Columbus,
isn't it?
HENRY: Yeah.

01:09.111 --> 01:10.726
The Columbus?
That's impossible.

01:10.862 --> 01:12.989
The Columbus was
an unmanned prototype.

01:13.115 --> 01:16.073
G.D.'s early research
into interstellar
exploration.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.782
It was lost
three years after launch.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.744
The project was scrapped,
the facility repurposed.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.373
We went a completely
different direction.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.285
Yeah, and apparently
so did this ship.

01:24.418 --> 01:28.127
(CHUCKLING)
It's amazing.
And a little disturbing.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.712
I mean, speaking
for those of us who
turned into zombies.

01:31.008 --> 01:33.044
Yeah, that's a good point.
Do l have to worry about it

01:33.176 --> 01:34.165
telling people
to do something else?

01:34.303 --> 01:35.964
Oh, I don't think so.
I mean, it was programmed

01:36.096 --> 01:40.806
to send out
a pre-arrival signal
to alert ground control.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.765
Yeah, that's
what we started to
pick up a week ago.

01:42.894 --> 01:47.308
Exactly, but it appears
that in the absence of
landing facilities,

01:47.441 --> 01:49.602
the ship improvised

01:49.735 --> 01:52.192
and somehow
got us to build
the next-best thing.

01:52.321 --> 01:53.811
Why didn't we recognize
the transmission?

01:53.947 --> 01:56.484
Why use
a completely foreign
handshake frequency?

01:56.617 --> 01:57.732
Well,
the antenna array
is damaged,

01:57.868 --> 01:59.654
and who knows what
this ship has gone through

01:59.786 --> 02:02.903
and what other onboard systems
have been affected
along the way?

02:03.040 --> 02:04.325
I mean, it's possible

02:04.458 --> 02:06.494
that it sent out the
only signal that it could.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.414
So I do have to worry
about the zombie problem.

02:09.546 --> 02:10.752
No, no.
I don't think so.

02:10.881 --> 02:14.794
I mean, now
that it's returned,
its mission is over.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.793
And its
onboard computers
have powered down. Yes?

02:17.929 --> 02:18.884
Yeah.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.847
So it's good. Right?

02:21.975 --> 02:22.725
Sure.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.352
I mean, still
what that thing did,

02:24.478 --> 02:26.639
it definitely left
a bad taste in my brain.

02:27.898 --> 02:28.853
Henry?

02:31.652 --> 02:32.641
ALLISON: Let's check
these figures.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.314
HENRY: Yeah,
sure, absolutely.

02:39.618 --> 02:43.531
A little disappointed
it's an American flag
instead of a Martian one?

02:43.664 --> 02:48.328
Well, it's not exactly
the first contact
l was hoping for,

02:48.460 --> 02:53.124
but, you know, considering
where this ship has been
over the past 20 years,

02:53.256 --> 02:54.462
its computer
could hold answers

02:54.591 --> 02:58.049
to questions
we can't even imagine.
Secrets of the universe.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.008
Yeah, it's
pretty cool.

03:03.558 --> 03:04.547
Yeah, it is.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.104
But it's a long-term
project, though.
Yeah, yeah.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.937
I mean,
it's going to take years
to analyze all that data.

03:11.066 --> 03:14.058
Kind of blows a hole
in my weekend plans, but...

03:14.194 --> 03:15.559
I hear you.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.813
No, no, I mean
there's a meteor
shower on Friday,

03:18.949 --> 03:21.031
but it's not like you
haven't seen one of
those, so...

03:21.159 --> 03:25.277
Yeah, well...
I mean, I haven't, but yes,
| get the gist of it.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.530
Really?
Yeah. But it
sounds cool.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.873
It sounds great.
It is cool.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.583
So, you want to go?

03:37.843 --> 03:38.878
Okay.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.388
Okay!

03:42.514 --> 03:44.425
I'm gonna...
Okay, yeah.

03:50.021 --> 03:53.263
Can you imagine
how excited Nathan would
have been to see this?

03:53.400 --> 03:54.936
Oh, he fought
the decommissioning
tooth and nail,

03:55.068 --> 03:56.933
said that we should
never give up hope.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.152
VVeH,lguess
he was right.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.611
You met Kim
on this project,
didn't you?

04:03.744 --> 04:06.861
Yeah, we designed
the computer systems.

04:06.997 --> 04:10.831
You know, she had a way
of finding a path
or solution that was just

04:12.377 --> 04:13.583
unexpected.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.627
Well, the way
I understand it,

04:15.756 --> 04:17.087
it was the way
the two of you
worked together

04:17.215 --> 04:19.672
that was so productive
and unique.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.416
We were a good team.

04:23.972 --> 04:28.841
(WARBLING)

04:28.977 --> 04:30.933
Hey! Do you hear that?

04:31.062 --> 04:32.051
What?

04:32.189 --> 04:33.895
The...
lt's making noise!

04:34.024 --> 04:35.855
HENRY:
Jack, I told you,
it's powered down.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.020
A protocol
has been initiated
to open the door.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.859
Initiated? From where?
From there!

04:40.655 --> 04:42.361
(RUMBLING)

04:43.867 --> 04:45.698
Okay, I need security here
right now!

05:19.903 --> 05:21.439
Hold your fire!

05:32.165 --> 05:33.541
lt's human?

05:45.929 --> 05:46.918
lt's Kim.

06:08.451 --> 06:12.160
Well, she is dehydrated.
Her electrolyte count is down.

06:12.289 --> 06:15.702
Probably the result
of plasma field exposure
after landing.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.449
OthenNise,
she's fine.

06:17.878 --> 06:21.086
Henry, you said this was
an unmanned mission, right?

06:21.214 --> 06:22.203
Absolutely, yeah.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.877
But the DNA tests
match Kim Yamazaki.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.672
Guys, Kim died
two years ago.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.544
I mean,
I saw her body.

06:29.681 --> 06:32.343
And her cellular structure
isn't human. That's not Kim.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.011
Okay, then,
what's going on?

06:34.144 --> 06:36.305
Well, look, this ship
has been traveling
through deep space

06:36.438 --> 06:39.100
for 20 years. That's
20 years of cosmic rays

06:39.232 --> 06:41.143
and primordial
particle radiation.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.857
Who knows what
could have happened?

06:42.986 --> 06:45.648
The biological mainframe.
I mean, it should be
able to tell us

06:45.780 --> 06:47.031
what occurred
on the trip.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.772
What's a...

06:48.909 --> 06:51.366
An organic computer
based on neural net
architecture,

06:51.494 --> 06:52.745
like the human brain.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.782
Instead of circuits
and wires,

06:54.915 --> 06:57.031
it processes information
using living cells.

06:57.167 --> 07:00.409
It can modify its structure
to solve any problem
that's presented.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.706
Great! How long
to boot it up?

07:02.839 --> 07:06.081
Yeah, might want
to go to plan B.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.424
l tapped into the ship
using my own organic rig.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.883
The onboard computer's
completely fried.
There's nothing left.

07:12.015 --> 07:13.971
KIM: I'm what's left.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.891
I'm what's left.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.727
Well, if a computer
can have a baby,

07:19.856 --> 07:22.142
then I definitely missed
a day in Mrs. Sebert's
health class.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.766
Like I said, the ship's
computer was made up
of living cells.

07:24.903 --> 07:25.983
Well, it doesn't
exactly explain

07:26.112 --> 07:28.444
where Kim 2.0
came from, or why.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.779
The ship's original system
was designed

07:29.908 --> 07:31.489
for a shorter
mission, right?

07:31.618 --> 07:32.824
That means
limited storage.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.489
Maybe when the computer
started to run out of room

07:34.621 --> 07:36.953
it realized it needed
a more complex
recording medium

07:37.082 --> 07:38.492
and the human body
was the best suited.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.741
Hold on, let's take
this one huge step
at a time.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.333
Tess, is your bio-lab
up and running?

07:42.462 --> 07:44.703
Oh, yeah,
but I was expecting
a little more E.T.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.215
and a little less
Henry's ex-girlfriend.

07:46.341 --> 07:48.627
All right, start scanning her
all the way down to the
molecular level.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.715
Got it.
Zane,

07:49.844 --> 07:52.631
I want you to do exactly
the same thing to the ship.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.800
Now, you said
the onboard computer
was non-functioning?

07:54.933 --> 07:56.218
I said it was fried.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.636
Well, get to work
on it anyway.

07:57.769 --> 07:58.758
There might be
something left,

07:58.895 --> 08:00.851
and ifthere is, it'll
give us more to go on
than we have now.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.178
I'm on it.
I'll talk to Henry.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.271
No. Henry has enough
on his plate.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.309
Okay.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.894
That was
something, huh?
Mmm-hmm.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.362
(SIGHING)

08:11.491 --> 08:13.903
You feeling okay?

08:14.035 --> 08:18.699
Yeah, she's just been
kicking me all morning.

08:19.791 --> 08:20.906
Whoo!

08:21.543 --> 08:24.080
She? It's a girl?

08:25.880 --> 08:28.872
I found out yesterday.
Yes, I'm having a girl.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.877
Congratulations.
I love little girls.

08:34.014 --> 08:34.969
I mean, no, I...
(LAUGHING)

08:35.098 --> 08:36.713
Oh! Oh. Here.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.390
That's her?

08:39.978 --> 08:42.094
Well, maybe
she likes excitement.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.310
Oh!

08:43.523 --> 08:45.104
(LAUGHING)
Just like her mother.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.734
Excitement. Well,
that's one word for it.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.944
Well, let me know
if there's something
I can do.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.783
Well, actually, there is
something that you can
do for me.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.698
It's very important.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.823
Well, I'm your guy.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.659
JO: Hey! You'll get
all your stuff back!

09:06.463 --> 09:09.079
Everybody, please
just calm down.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.872
WOMAN: Excuse me!

09:11.843 --> 09:14.209
I need a toaster oven,
bagel-capable.

09:14.345 --> 09:15.960
Right. White
or chrome?

09:16.097 --> 09:17.553
It's bisque.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.258
(CLEARS THROAT)

09:22.395 --> 09:24.556
Okay, I need to
just check you off.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.763
The system is
totally overloaded.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.016
First somebody
steals my toaster oven

09:29.152 --> 09:30.983
to build whatever it was
out there in the woods,

09:31.112 --> 09:33.945
and now I have to wait here
for two hours to get it back.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.907
Huh? Here you go.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.991
This is better
than the one I had!

09:39.788 --> 09:42.450
No, wait, that's
not how this works.

09:42.665 --> 09:46.249
Dr. Lieber.
L-I-E-B-E-R.

09:46.377 --> 09:48.584
And what can we get
for you, Dr. Lieber?

09:48.713 --> 09:51.500
I'm here to pick up
my 200-petavolt
boost converter.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.874
And what would that
look like, exactly?

09:54.010 --> 09:56.251
It's about that big.
It's got lots of
circuit boards.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.844
Kind of looks
like any other
boost converter.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.888
(MUTTERING)
I can go look...

10:01.893 --> 10:03.508
"Lieber." Uh...

10:03.686 --> 10:04.641
(SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION)

10:04.771 --> 10:06.181
I hate this thing.

10:06.648 --> 10:09.606
Probably got a virus.
PCs are very susceptible.

10:09.734 --> 10:12.316
That's why I switched
to organic computer years ago.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.481
Whoopee for you.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.901
Is this what
you're looking for?

10:19.244 --> 10:20.654
Perfect.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.237
It's going to be
a long day.
It already is.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.739
Next!
What can we
get for you?

10:26.751 --> 10:29.618
There was a malfunction
with the primary machine.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.542
the original
organic computer?
Yes.

10:33.675 --> 10:36.838
The primary machine
experienced voltage
irregularities.

10:36.970 --> 10:40.929
In order to
continue its mission,
it created a replacement.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.046
You.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.719
I became
the primary machine.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.808
What do you mean,
created?
I was grown.

10:45.937 --> 10:48.849
Grown from what?
Your ship was constructed
in a clean room.

10:48.982 --> 10:52.145
The primary machine
was the only
organic material onboard.

10:52.277 --> 10:57.317
Actually, that's probably
not true. No environment
is ever perfectly clean.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.063
Now, we took level-one
precautions, but...

10:59.200 --> 11:01.361
A few strands of hair,
an eyelash...

11:01.494 --> 11:02.700
Askin cell.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.411
It was fortunate
that the DNA strands
were intact

11:05.540 --> 11:07.781
and I had
such a detailed
profile on Dr. Yamazaki

11:07.917 --> 11:09.782
due to her involvement
on the project.

11:09.919 --> 11:10.908
Henry, is this
possible?

11:11.045 --> 11:13.957
The computer
was programmed
for self-preservation,

11:14.090 --> 11:17.207
to keep itself operating
under any circumstances.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.585
So it found
a flake of skin

11:19.721 --> 11:21.131
and created
a whole other Kim?

11:21.431 --> 11:23.717
Well, it evolved,
adapted.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.341
It made an
incredible leap.

11:26.477 --> 11:29.389
But why didn't it
model anyone else who
worked on the ship?

11:29.522 --> 11:31.683
Why didn't it
choose you, Henry?

11:32.108 --> 11:34.565
Kim Yamazaki's sample
was the most viable.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.231
We designed it
to improvise,
Kim and I.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.565
I look fon/vard to
working with you, Henry.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.153
It was always
a great pleasure

11:47.749 --> 11:48.864
for Kim.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.837
I need something
to write with.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.515
Well. we're in
the home stretch.

12:08.645 --> 12:09.930
I don't want to see
another toaster again.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.805
(SCOFFS) I don't want
to eat toast again.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.647
But we are
going to have to do
another inventory.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.937
(GROANS) Maybe
in a few minutes?

12:17.070 --> 12:18.606
Okay.

12:19.989 --> 12:24.198
So much stuff.
So many wack jobs...

12:24.327 --> 12:25.863
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
Very funny.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.031
What do you want, Fargo?
We already gave you back
your thingy.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.702
This is not my thingy.
This has a ZX-21 chip.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.995
Idont
want to know
about this stuff.

12:34.128 --> 12:37.962
My boost converter
has a ZY-21 chip.
This is clearly inferior.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.043
You pulled the old
bait and switch.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.417
Fargo, look around.
There's not much left.

12:42.553 --> 12:43.804
No, we...

12:43.930 --> 12:46.296
Yeah, we did give out
something that looked
like this earlier today.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.387
To who?

12:47.517 --> 12:50.429
Um... Oh, God. Uh...

12:50.561 --> 12:51.721
Lieber.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.686
Yeah. Yeah,
that's the guy.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.806
He's been eyeing my
converter for months.

12:55.942 --> 12:59.685
Easy, Fargo. It was
absolutely crazy earlier.

12:59.821 --> 13:00.936
Could have been
an honest mistake.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.939
There's nothing honest
about Tom Lieber.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.033
I'm going to get back
what's mine.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.202
Have a nice day!
(GRUNTING)

13:11.499 --> 13:13.865
Add it to
the to-do list?

13:15.878 --> 13:16.867
Yeah.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.634
Brought your
blender back.
Thank you.

13:26.889 --> 13:27.878
What's that?

13:28.016 --> 13:32.510
It's my organic computer.
This gel uses electrical
impulses from my hands

13:32.645 --> 13:35.261
to interface with
what's left of the ship's
onboard data system.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.605
I'm using it
to try and pull
any remaining data

13:37.734 --> 13:39.395
out of the
biological mainframe.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.143
It has a light-pulse-based
transfer system.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.235
It's pretty cool.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.604
Didn't you say
earlier...

13:44.741 --> 13:47.824
Yeah, I know I said
what was on the ship
was DOA.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.329
I can confirm
that what's in there
made Kim,

13:50.455 --> 13:53.037
but that's about it.
20 years of discoveries,

13:53.166 --> 13:56.624
more knowledge than
what mankind has learned
since the beginning of time

13:56.753 --> 13:59.039
is locked inside Kim
and nowhere else?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.254
We've never encountered
anything like her before.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.418
It's not like
we can just download her.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.963
I'm still saying,
we need Henry on this.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.841
Well, now that I've
finished my deliveries,

14:09.974 --> 14:11.714
think I might be able
to help with that.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.263
Carter?
Yeah?

14:15.938 --> 14:17.223
This isn't my blender.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.346
What?

14:31.287 --> 14:33.869
If Lieber says that
that boost converter
isn't his,

14:33.998 --> 14:37.081
I say
we let Fargo and him
settle it in a cage match.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.746
I put five bucks
on Fargo.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.209
Nice.
He's scrappy.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.124
(KNOCKING)
Dr. Lieber!

14:44.884 --> 14:46.294
Dr. Lieber?

14:48.262 --> 14:50.924
We got your
boost converter.

14:52.475 --> 14:55.888
This looks more
like a haunted house
than a physics lab.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.635
Dr. Lieber?

14:57.772 --> 14:58.852
(GRUNTS IN PAIN)

15:03.653 --> 15:04.768
Do you smell that?

15:04.904 --> 15:06.690
It's like
something's burning.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.070
Yeah.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.836
Or someone.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.291
Okay.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.138
(SIGHING)

15:34.267 --> 15:37.725
So looks like
Dr. Lieber there
was electrocuted.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.219
Yeah, probably.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.812
I still have to do
an autopsy, but yeah.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.182
You know which piece of
equipment malfunctioned?

15:44.318 --> 15:47.902
Dr. Lieber was an expert
in electromagnetic physics.

15:48.239 --> 15:49.729
Pick one.

15:50.658 --> 15:51.818
I'm sorry.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.237
I rebooted
the power regulators

15:54.370 --> 15:55.701
so you guys
don't have to
worry about it.

15:55.830 --> 15:59.618
Fargo might.
The boost converter he
accused Lieber of stealing?

15:59.750 --> 16:02.457
It's gone. Yanked
out of the panel.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.456
Tell me he didn't
cause this.

16:04.589 --> 16:08.878
Well, I'll run
a few diagnostics,
but it's possible.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.090
(SIGHS) Great.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.884
So how you doing
with the whole Kim thing?

16:23.983 --> 16:25.348
It's not Kim.

16:26.611 --> 16:30.354
I mean, I know
it seems that it is,
but it's not Kim.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.868
I'm a scientist.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.741
So whatever happened
on that ship

16:43.711 --> 16:45.326
is a scientific issue.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.751
Good. Then, um,

16:49.967 --> 16:52.674
they're gonna need
your help dealing with it
back at G.D.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.511
Okay, I took it.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.972
Don't look at me
like that!

17:02.730 --> 17:04.937
It's not stealing
when you take
something that's yours.

17:05.066 --> 17:06.101
Fargo...

17:06.234 --> 17:07.690
What, was I supposed
to ask him?

17:07.818 --> 17:09.319
Lieber? That weasel?

17:09.445 --> 17:12.858
Fargo,
that weasel is...

17:13.574 --> 17:14.859
He's dead.

17:16.827 --> 17:17.816
Come again?

17:17.954 --> 17:21.742
We think
that Dr. Lieber
was electrocuted.

17:22.124 --> 17:26.663
And we're thinking maybe
it had something to do with
the missing boost converter.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.754
Uh-oh.
Yeah.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.838
Oh, my God.
I'm going to jail,
aren't I?

17:35.346 --> 17:37.382
The big house.
The slammer.
The hoosegow.

17:37.515 --> 17:40.973
I'm going to spend the rest
of my life president of the
Attica Physics Club!

17:41.269 --> 17:42.975
Man up, Fargo.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.685
(GASPING)

17:46.315 --> 17:48.806
Henry's doing
an autopsy right now.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.808
We're going to have
a lot more information
after that,

17:50.945 --> 17:53.732
but if you
could walk us through
everything that you did...

17:53.864 --> 17:56.947
And, um,
deep breaths, okay?

17:58.578 --> 18:01.741
Still no luck
coming up with any kind
of data transfer protocol.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.487
Well,
we've connected people
to computers before.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.740
The prosthetics department
has been doing it for years.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.868
Well, yeah,
but the information in Kim
isn't centralized to a brain.

18:09.005 --> 18:11.371
Every cell
in the entire organism
is a data recorder.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.169
A hundred trillion cells,
each with something
to tell us.

18:14.302 --> 18:17.135
I mean, how much data
do you think we're
talking about here?

18:18.639 --> 18:20.755
ZANE: I'm
guessing a lot.

18:20.891 --> 18:24.099
She's been at it
for hours, ever since
we gave her that marker.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.014
ALLISON: Well,
that's one way
to access her data.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.933
Writing and speech
are the slowest methods

18:28.065 --> 18:30.056
of information transfer
on the planet.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.729
Imagine
if I asked you
about Shakespeare

18:32.862 --> 18:36.525
and you just started
writing out his plays.
It would take you forever.

18:37.617 --> 18:41.280
2,135 years
and 69 days.

18:41.412 --> 18:44.495
The time it will take me
to download my data
using this method.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.830
I've run
alternate simulations,

18:45.958 --> 18:48.665
but so far
this scenario has
the shortest timeline.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.747
Well, we will need
a better solution
than that.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.962
Oh, believe me,
it'll be worth it.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.838
Take a look
at this.

18:55.343 --> 18:58.210
These are, what,
gravity field
distortion readings?

18:58.346 --> 19:01.463
Exactly. Taken from
beyond the heliopause,

19:01.599 --> 19:06.844
indicating the existence
of four Earth-like planets
within 10 light years of us.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.220
Oh, my God. That's
right in the neighborhood.

19:09.357 --> 19:10.722
All right, pull in any
department that you need.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.895
I want information transfer
options on my desk as soon
as possible.

19:14.028 --> 19:16.815
It might be beneficial to
assemble my original team.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.484
Dr. Deacon
and my co-designer,
Kim Yamazaki.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.159
Dr. Yamazaki died
two years ago.
I'm sorry.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.166
That's unfortunate.
I was looking fonNard
to meeting her.

19:40.971 --> 19:44.429
I've examined
Dr. Lieber's remains

19:44.558 --> 19:47.470
and the electron
generator in his lab.

19:47.603 --> 19:48.809
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

19:48.938 --> 19:52.726
And all the
voltage transfer limits
are within material tolerance.

19:53.401 --> 19:56.768
Yes! Thank you!
Thank you!
Yeah.

19:56.904 --> 20:02.399
And Dr. Lieber's machine
did not malfunction
or electrocute him.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.867
So, I guess
you're free to go.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.658
Freedom! Lunch
is on me, boys.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.287
So, what
did happen?

20:16.424 --> 20:18.756
Lieber electrocuted
his machine.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.341
(STAMMERING)
A voltage pathway analysis
indicates that his body

20:21.470 --> 20:24.462
generated a bolt of current
that overloaded everything
in his lab.

20:24.598 --> 20:27.761
It was like
some sort of internal
electrical storm.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.269
Is that even possible?

20:29.395 --> 20:32.558
I have no idea. It's one
of the strangest things
I've ever seen.

20:32.690 --> 20:33.850
Yeah.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.689
An SDS scan will
not be effective

20:35.818 --> 20:38.059
in decoding
my amino acid constructs.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.856
I've tweaked
the polarities.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.695
I'm thinking
we've got a shot.

20:41.824 --> 20:43.280
In addition, there's
the risk the procedure

20:43.409 --> 20:45.274
could harm
my neural pathways.

20:45.411 --> 20:49.450
Come on. Trust me.
I'm one of the smart ones.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.366
You could damage me
and my data.

20:54.837 --> 20:56.452
We'll take it
nice and slow.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.750
You let me know if
there's a problem, okay?

20:58.883 --> 21:00.373
ALLISON: Lieber produced
an electrical charge

21:00.509 --> 21:03.876
strong enough
to short out his entire
office and himself.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.762
Yeah, was he connected
to that ship that landed,

21:06.891 --> 21:08.381
or to Kim or Henry?

21:08.517 --> 21:09.973
No, he wasn't
at the landing site

21:10.102 --> 21:11.808
and he wasn't even
at G.D. today.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.265
ZANE: Initiating
the SDS scan.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.022
(WARBLING)

21:17.526 --> 21:19.812
(RAPID BEEPING)

21:23.365 --> 21:24.445
That was
a neural spike.

21:24.575 --> 21:25.860
It wasn't me.

21:26.744 --> 21:27.733
Oh!

21:28.329 --> 21:29.614
What are you doing?

21:31.916 --> 21:33.531
You're creating
a feedback loop!

21:36.378 --> 21:37.504
Stop!

21:38.881 --> 21:40.337
(SCREAMING)

21:43.385 --> 21:44.670
Shut the power
down! Now!

21:51.101 --> 21:53.888
(GASPING)

22:03.489 --> 22:07.448
Last thing I remember,
I was trying to get
the data out of her, and...

22:07.952 --> 22:09.738
And boom,

22:10.454 --> 22:12.570
I hit the ground
seeing fireworks.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.992
Was it some kind
of seizure?
Not in the usual sense.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.207
His convulsions
were extremely violent

22:17.336 --> 22:20.169
and his
electroencephalogram
is still off the charts.

22:20.297 --> 22:23.084
Is this the same thing
that Lieber had?

22:23.217 --> 22:24.297
I'll have to do
more tests.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.291
Wait a minute,
didn't Lieber die?

22:26.428 --> 22:27.759
Lieber was alone,
you weren't.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.298
We got to you
in a matter of seconds

22:29.431 --> 22:32.639
and we were able to dissipate
your internal voltage spike.

22:32.768 --> 22:36.386
So can I get
back to work?

22:40.860 --> 22:43.067
We're gonna need you
to stay here
a little longer.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.696
Why? I thought you guys
caught it in time.

22:44.822 --> 22:47.655
We're suppressing his
neuro-electrical activity,

22:47.783 --> 22:50.490
but there's
another electrical wave
already building.

22:50.619 --> 22:51.699
Meaning...

22:52.246 --> 22:53.702
Is this going
to keep happening?

22:53.831 --> 22:55.037
We're going to find out
what caused this.

22:55.165 --> 22:57.781
I know what
caused this. Kim.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.078
Oh...

23:00.129 --> 23:01.665
Where are you going?
To shut it down.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.708
The information is
too valuable for that.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.502
It attacked Zane.

23:05.634 --> 23:09.843
Jo, we're doing
an investigation,
and there are rules.

23:09.972 --> 23:13.339
Now, we have a suspect there
who we're going to talk to.

23:13.475 --> 23:16.638
Your suspect
is a computer
from outer space.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.146
Yes.

23:18.272 --> 23:19.261
Carter.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.443
I've reviewed
the incident,

23:29.575 --> 23:32.408
and although I understand
why you draw
a different conclusion,

23:32.912 --> 23:34.743
my assessment is that
your colleague suffers

23:34.872 --> 23:36.533
from a congenital
brain abnormality.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.405
He was fine until
he got in there
with you.

23:38.542 --> 23:39.827
CARTER: Easy.

23:39.960 --> 23:43.123
Let's just
run through this
one more time, okay?

23:44.131 --> 23:48.465
So the spaceship lands
and you come out.

23:48.594 --> 23:52.257
A few hours later,
Lieber is electrocuted
in his own lab

23:52.389 --> 23:54.596
and then
the exact same thing
happens to Zane,

23:55.267 --> 23:57.303
right here
in front of you.

23:58.312 --> 23:59.301
And if! may say,

23:59.855 --> 24:03.473
you weren't too excited
about the test
that he was doing.

24:04.318 --> 24:06.434
Perhaps there
was a malfunction
with his equipment.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.606
A short in
the monitoring module.

24:08.948 --> 24:12.236
That's a good idea,
and we checked that,

24:12.368 --> 24:13.904
and the machines
were fine.

24:14.536 --> 24:16.697
How would I be connected
with Dr. Lieber?

24:16.830 --> 24:18.491
We haven't
figured that out yet.

24:20.084 --> 24:23.872
Perhaps proximity
is not a factor
in this equation.

24:25.130 --> 24:29.590
Are you saying
that you could zap
anyone, anywhere?

24:29.969 --> 24:31.925
That might explain
what happened.

24:32.054 --> 24:34.386
And I have no memory
of such an act.

24:34.515 --> 24:36.130
I'm not programmed
for aggression.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.552
No, but
you are programmed
for self-preservation.

24:38.936 --> 24:40.597
Yes, you're right.

24:41.563 --> 24:42.552
Thanks.

24:44.274 --> 24:45.354
You should shut me down.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.652
Eradicate my
voluntary functions.

24:50.781 --> 24:52.817
And do your best
to preserve my data.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.908
Perhaps immersion in a slurry
of liquid nitrogen and argon.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.742
That's what I'm
talking about.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.246
Kim,

25:03.544 --> 25:05.956
is this
your way of, um,

25:07.756 --> 25:09.007
admitting

25:09.383 --> 25:10.873
that you attacked Zane?

25:11.010 --> 25:15.845
No. But a man is dead
and another man is
in danger,

25:16.348 --> 25:18.930
and you just presented
a logical explanation.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.633
Whether due to
a programming error

25:21.770 --> 25:23.886
or degradation caused
by my journey home,

25:24.732 --> 25:26.848
I might be
a serious threat.

25:29.570 --> 25:30.559
Terminate me.

25:39.455 --> 25:40.786
She really
said that?

25:42.875 --> 25:43.990
Yeah.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.079
It was spooky.

25:48.630 --> 25:50.962
I mean, you've got
to help me out here.

25:54.970 --> 25:57.052
Is there a person
in there?

25:57.181 --> 25:59.763
I mean, is that Kim?

26:02.519 --> 26:04.475
Okay. Yes, I know,

26:04.605 --> 26:07.722
it's an organic computer
programmed to act
like a human.

26:07.858 --> 26:09.143
I get it.

26:11.487 --> 26:12.442
But

26:15.491 --> 26:17.152
what is a person?

26:19.286 --> 26:20.992
I mean, could there be

26:23.248 --> 26:25.159
a piece of Kim
in there?

26:26.710 --> 26:27.950
Scientifically,

26:30.714 --> 26:32.124
impossible.

26:37.221 --> 26:40.964
But don't you think I've been
asking myself that question
since I saw her?

26:45.854 --> 26:46.889
I don't think
she did it.

26:48.524 --> 26:52.358
Well, apparently, she does.

26:55.364 --> 26:57.275
Bottom line,
we gotta figure out
what's going on

26:57.407 --> 26:59.238
before someone else
gets hurt.

26:59.368 --> 27:02.485
So, obviously,
I'm gonna need you

27:02.621 --> 27:05.579
to compare what you're
learning about Zane

27:06.166 --> 27:08.077
to what you know
about Lieber.

27:11.505 --> 27:16.499
And I'm going
to need you

27:17.970 --> 27:20.507
to examine Kim.

27:23.350 --> 27:27.764
You know, we don't
have to save Kim

27:31.066 --> 27:32.226
(SNIFFS SHARPLY)

27:32.442 --> 27:33.431
for me.

27:35.279 --> 27:36.394
I know.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.323
Okay, then. Fine.

28:11.481 --> 28:15.065
Henry. I'm glad
to see you.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.985
(CURTLY) Sit down, please,
and roll up your sleeves.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.154
Yes, of course.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.284
I'm glad they sent you.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.528
VVhy?

28:28.665 --> 28:32.578
It's only appropriate
that you would be the one
to terminate me.

28:34.171 --> 28:37.584
No, I'mjust going
to take a fresh
blood sample.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.586
What type of analysis
are you going to perform?

28:40.719 --> 28:42.380
The usual.

28:42.512 --> 28:45.595
Will you be requiring
more than one blood sample?

28:45.724 --> 28:47.840
I'd be very interested
in going over the results
with you.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.092
Just, please,
let me...

28:50.229 --> 28:51.560
You always liked
collaborating.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.349
Stop it.

28:57.110 --> 28:59.317
This is very confusing,
isn't it?

29:09.373 --> 29:10.453
Ouch!

29:10.582 --> 29:11.867
What?

29:12.918 --> 29:14.158
lthun.

29:17.589 --> 29:21.298
Allison! Jack!
I did a static comparison
of Zane's test results

29:21.426 --> 29:24.042
against everything
from Lieber, and there is
a connection.

29:24.179 --> 29:25.760
Well, we know that.
Yeah, the
electrocutions.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.720
No, no, no. It's a virus.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.841
Wait, what type of virus
could cause this kind
of electrical disturbance?

29:30.978 --> 29:34.516
Well, just think about it.
It doesn't so much reproduce
as it backs itself up,

29:34.648 --> 29:38.186
creating identical copies
over and over again
without mutation.

29:38.318 --> 29:40.855
Every living thing mutates.
That's how nature works.

29:40.988 --> 29:42.774
Well, is it
possible, then,

29:42.906 --> 29:44.362
that this isn't
from nature?

29:44.491 --> 29:47.324
Well, all this talk about
electricity and backups
and overloads.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.943
I mean, it sounds
like you're talking
about a computer virus.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.286
And that's exactly right.

29:51.415 --> 29:55.283
A biological organism encoded
with binary information
instead of DNA,

29:55.419 --> 29:56.875
and we have no defense
against it.

29:57.004 --> 30:01.088
And, how does itjump
from computer
to living person?

30:01.216 --> 30:02.331
Oh, you already
said it.

30:02.467 --> 30:05.550
It came from
an organic computer.
A living organism.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.306
So it was Kim?
The Kim clone?

30:08.432 --> 30:12.220
No, she's been under full
bio-containment protocol
since we got her here.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.432
But the virus
still got out.

30:13.562 --> 30:15.427
No, I did a full workup.
She's clean.

30:15.564 --> 30:16.679
She's not the source
of the virus.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.727
Henry, only
one organic computer
walked off that ship.

30:20.986 --> 30:22.101
True,

30:22.696 --> 30:24.277
but there is another one
still onboard.

30:25.866 --> 30:26.946
Right.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.576
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
Decontamination complete.

30:45.719 --> 30:47.300
Shouldn't you
be wearing a mask?

30:47.429 --> 30:48.418
I am.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.422
It's one of those
high-tech ones
of Henry's.

30:52.976 --> 30:54.637
We've all got them.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.313
So what's all this?

31:01.193 --> 31:03.730
Treats. I brought
your favorite foods.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.774
Uh, all of your
favorite foods.

31:06.907 --> 31:09.114
Olives stuffed
with blue cheese...

31:09.242 --> 31:11.494
Awesome.
Mmm-hmm.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.952
Toasted peanut butter
and bacon,

31:14.915 --> 31:16.121
egg salad

31:17.167 --> 31:18.953
and rocky road
ice cream.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.289
I love you, Jo.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.502
I love you, too.

31:39.815 --> 31:41.100
CARTER: That was heavy.

31:41.233 --> 31:44.191
HENRY: It's the motherboard
from the ship's
organic computer.

31:44.319 --> 31:48.938
Or what's left of it.
The entire biological matrix
has been burned up.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.154
Overloaded.

31:50.283 --> 31:54.026
Yeah, it looks like
exactly the same thing
that happened to Dr. Lieber.

31:54.162 --> 31:57.950
It's got the virus,
and we have definitely
found the source.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.539
Zane jacked
directly into it.

31:59.668 --> 32:01.875
It must have jumped
to his organic computer.

32:02.003 --> 32:03.743
Well, he was in it
up to his elbows.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.586
And how did Lieber
get infected?

32:05.715 --> 32:07.171
He went organic
years ago.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.427
The computers,
not the food.

32:09.553 --> 32:10.963
Well, if he had
a first-generation
device,

32:11.096 --> 32:12.836
he would have been
more susceptible
to attack.

32:12.973 --> 32:14.713
The infection is traveling
through the network.

32:14.850 --> 32:16.556
Wait, hold on. How many
organic computers are there?

32:16.685 --> 32:19.643
Well, there's 25 labs
that are equipped,
so that's

32:21.148 --> 32:23.855
200 people.
200 people?

32:24.276 --> 32:26.813
We've got a potential
epidemic on our hands.

32:39.416 --> 32:42.954
Well, the virus is causing
Zane's neuro-electrical
charge to build up.

32:43.086 --> 32:45.668
I'd say two hours before
he has another seizure.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.379
And this time I don't know
if we'll be able to stop it.

32:49.843 --> 32:51.003
So, is this
all of them?

32:52.304 --> 32:54.590
Yeah, yeah,
it's everyone who had
an organic computer.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.554
Yeah, we quarantined
all the computers.

32:56.683 --> 32:59.720
So far we've
detected symptoms
in 69 people.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.812
Now, does that mean
all of them are
going to get sick?

33:03.940 --> 33:04.690
Well, like
with any virus,

33:04.816 --> 33:07.728
we have to assume that
some will be affected
more than others.

33:07.861 --> 33:08.816
But the more
they get hit,

33:08.945 --> 33:11.652
the harder time
we're going to have
suppressing the symptoms.

33:11.781 --> 33:14.693
Now, what happens
when or if

33:14.951 --> 33:17.488
people without organic
computers get sick?

33:17.621 --> 33:21.455
Well, if transmission only
occurs with direct contact
to the computer,

33:21.583 --> 33:23.949
there's no reason
to believe that's
going to happen.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.877
Other than this.

33:31.009 --> 33:31.998
(SIGHING)

33:34.721 --> 33:37.963
We're all infected.
The virus is jumping from
human to human via touch,

33:38.099 --> 33:39.430
using our own
electrical impulses.

33:39.559 --> 33:41.095
I'm instituting
a level-one
quarantine.

33:41.228 --> 33:42.934
All entrances
to the town need
to be sealed,

33:43.063 --> 33:44.052
no one comes
in or out.

33:44.189 --> 33:45.349
Right, what about the
people already here?

33:45.482 --> 33:47.689
The safest thing
that anyone can do
is stay indoors.

33:47.817 --> 33:48.852
Will that keep them
from getting it?

33:48.985 --> 33:51.852
Well, for now, but we're
dealing with a new form
of infection here.

33:51.988 --> 33:52.977
One that is
adapﬂng.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.981
Our body has no
inherent immunities
and no way to fight it.

33:56.117 --> 33:58.369
I developed
a crude test.

33:58.495 --> 34:01.077
The infection rate
is already climbing.

34:01.706 --> 34:02.821
How long
do we have?

34:02.958 --> 34:06.246
Well, based
on the timeline
for Zane and Lieber,

34:06.378 --> 34:09.745
in 12 hours
we won't be able to find
anyone who isn't infected.

34:09.881 --> 34:12.338
Twelve... Well,
what about Kim?

34:12.467 --> 34:15.049
I mean, you tested her,
right? You said that
she wasn't the source,

34:15.178 --> 34:19.091
so that means
she's immune, right?

34:19.224 --> 34:23.809
Maybe. Well,
probably. I mean,
the original computer

34:23.937 --> 34:25.677
could have written
some sort of immunity
into its code

34:25.814 --> 34:28.681
to protect itself,
so she could be
our answer.

34:32.904 --> 34:36.863
Henry.
You're disregarding
your isolation protocols.

34:36.992 --> 34:40.530
We realize
that you no longer pose
a threat to us.

34:40.662 --> 34:41.742
Are you sure?
Mmm-hmm.

34:41.871 --> 34:45.455
Sheriff Carter
presented a very logical
and compelling argument.

34:45.584 --> 34:47.700
Well, he worked just
as hard to prove that
you had nothing to do

34:47.836 --> 34:49.372
with what was
happening to us,

34:49.504 --> 34:50.869
and that you
might even be
able to help us.

34:51.006 --> 34:51.995
Oh!

34:52.132 --> 34:56.842
I believe that there are
antibodies in your cells
that could save Eureka.

34:56.970 --> 34:58.301
Do you need any more
tissue samples, or...

34:58.430 --> 35:02.423
Actually, I think
we should work together.

35:06.563 --> 35:08.099
I'd like that very much.

35:08.982 --> 35:12.224
Just so I know
what I've got
to look fonNard to,

35:12.360 --> 35:14.146
are you
experiencing
any symptoms,

35:14.279 --> 35:16.315
tingling
in your extremities,
blurred vision?

35:16.448 --> 35:18.734
Being able to
power a flashlight
without batteries?

35:18.867 --> 35:19.856
Yeah, like that.

35:19.993 --> 35:20.982
No. I'm good.
Okay.

35:21.995 --> 35:24.486
It's not looking good
for the meteor shower.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.498
Um, this will keep you
from having to be hooked up
to a suppression unit

35:28.627 --> 35:31.164
for a few more
hours. It's an
electro-resistant gel.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.708
Sounds good.
Bad news is,
it's going to hurt.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.626
Oh, well, how much?

35:35.759 --> 35:36.874
Jo didn't complain.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.341
Well, let's not...

35:38.470 --> 35:39.880
(EXHALING FORCEFULLY)

35:42.265 --> 35:44.506
Yeah,
now I've got tingling
in my extremities.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.758
I'm sorry.

35:45.894 --> 35:47.805
Jack. We found something.

35:50.440 --> 35:53.853
Jack was right. Before the
original computer on the ship
was destroyed by the virus,

35:53.985 --> 35:56.897
it designs and encodes
an immunity
for its replacement.

35:57.030 --> 35:58.361
Have you been able
to isolate it?

35:58.490 --> 36:00.822
Yes, yeah,
we have.

36:00.950 --> 36:03.862
Great! What you got?
A booster shot,
a patch...

36:03.995 --> 36:05.280
Ow! That's
getting old.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.870
Yeah, it's not
going to be that easy.
There's a big difference

36:07.999 --> 36:10.991
between our
immune system and
that of an organic computer.

36:11.127 --> 36:14.244
Traditional methods
of immunization's
just not gonna work.

36:14.381 --> 36:17.669
Well, what about
Zane's goo thing?

36:17.801 --> 36:20.383
It was
attached to the ship.
He said he used light?

36:20.512 --> 36:23.345
The human optic system
is a lot like that
of a computer.

36:23.473 --> 36:25.555
It's a light-based
information transfer
system.

36:25.934 --> 36:28.801
So can we use
eyes to transfer
the information?

36:28.937 --> 36:32.225
Well, our eyes process visual
information and turn it into
a series of signals...

36:32.357 --> 36:33.938
That the brain
can understand.

36:34.067 --> 36:36.558
Which means
we might be able
to distribute immunity

36:36.695 --> 36:38.777
with an intense
beam of...
Of spectrum-tuned light.

36:38.905 --> 36:40.816
Hold on, that's
a lot of power.

36:40.949 --> 36:44.737
Maybe 30 to 40 petavolts
per byte of distributed
information.

36:44.869 --> 36:47.861
That's the output
of the North American
power grid for a year.

36:47.997 --> 36:50.704
We've got maybe
10 hours. Suggestions?

36:50.834 --> 36:53.576
Well, we have
fusion cells in
chemical storage,

36:53.712 --> 36:56.294
but it'll take days
to get up and running.
Antimatter generator.

36:56.423 --> 36:58.084
ALLISON: Prototype's
not ready.
Well, how about plasma?

36:58.216 --> 37:00.832
That's good
for big, high-energy
bursts of power, right?

37:03.096 --> 37:05.553
What? I pay
attention.

37:06.975 --> 37:09.842
Plasma might do it,
but we don't have
the components

37:09.978 --> 37:11.843
to build one
anywhere near big enough.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.720
I think we do.

37:14.107 --> 37:16.063
But I'm going to need
the blender back.

37:22.031 --> 37:23.737
MAN: Please form
an orderly line.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.823
Your items will
be returned to you
as soon as possible.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.488
CARTER: Next!
WOMAN: I am going
to get this toaster

37:27.620 --> 37:30.282
returned to me, right?
Okay.

37:36.004 --> 37:38.495
Lawn sprinkler, 15 inches,
looks like titanium alloy.

37:38.631 --> 37:39.586
Excellent, thank you.

37:39.716 --> 37:40.751
Tower three,
fifth bay.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.340
Just above the
resonance coupler.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.245
MAN: We're hooked up
and good to go.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.579
We got 60 more cases
in the last hour.

38:20.715 --> 38:23.502
Relay the immunization data
into a pulse generator

38:23.635 --> 38:25.421
at 510 nanometers.
500...

38:25.553 --> 38:26.668
Green light.
God, thank you.

38:26.805 --> 38:29.638
I've alerted
all departments to shield
their optical equipment.

38:29.766 --> 38:31.381
What about our
optical equipment?

38:31.518 --> 38:33.679
This wavelength of light
won't cause ocular damage,

38:33.812 --> 38:34.801
it should only
affect the virus.

38:34.938 --> 38:36.053
Here's hoping.

38:36.439 --> 38:39.431
All right,
here we go.
60%.

38:40.401 --> 38:41.811
(WHIRRING)

38:42.821 --> 38:44.607
HENRY: 70.

38:44.739 --> 38:46.946
Henry, it's
powering down.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.989
Yeah.
It powered down
to 30%.

38:49.202 --> 38:50.237
What's wrong?

38:50.370 --> 38:51.610
We're missing
a component.

38:51.746 --> 38:52.861
Did you collect
all the pieces?

38:52.997 --> 38:55.613
(STAMMERING) Yeah.
No, I went...

38:56.918 --> 38:58.658
Are you kidding me?

39:01.756 --> 39:03.257
What happened to respect
for personal property?

39:03.383 --> 39:05.169
What happened to trying
to save peoples' lives?

39:05.301 --> 39:06.711
Better late
than never?

39:06.970 --> 39:10.212
(SIGHING) He has
some good qualities.

39:11.057 --> 39:13.799
Okay, are we ready
to try this again?

39:13.935 --> 39:15.596
Cross your fingers.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.395
(WHIRRING)

39:19.524 --> 39:20.513
HENRY: 80.

39:22.944 --> 39:24.150
90.

39:25.154 --> 39:26.485
100.

40:13.786 --> 40:17.278
(POWERING DOWN)

40:29.010 --> 40:30.295
(SIGHS)

40:30.428 --> 40:31.713
All checked out.

40:33.306 --> 40:35.422
I was really
worried about you.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.219
Me, too.

40:39.604 --> 40:40.969
How are you feeling?

40:41.731 --> 40:43.141
(SIGHING) Mmm...

40:43.274 --> 40:44.775
You tell me.

40:56.371 --> 40:57.827
Any sparks?

40:59.207 --> 41:00.242
No.

41:02.835 --> 41:04.496
Just the good kind.

41:27.193 --> 41:31.357
Iboughtyou
a change of clothes.

41:36.869 --> 41:38.370
Thank you, Henry.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.861
You're welcome.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.325
What happens now?

41:46.671 --> 41:47.660
Uh...

41:47.797 --> 41:50.584
Well, there's still
an incredible amount
of information

41:50.717 --> 41:52.173
locked inside of you,

41:52.301 --> 41:55.839
and we have to figure
a way of getting it
out safely,

41:55.972 --> 41:57.712
so we have a lot
of work to do.

41:58.391 --> 41:59.380
Together.

42:11.571 --> 42:13.436
Then let's
get started.

42:25.168 --> 42:26.749
Oldest story
in the world.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.410
Boy meets girl,
boy loses girl,

42:29.547 --> 42:31.378
boy meets computer.

42:31.507 --> 42:33.884
Well, everybody needs
a hand to hold.

42:34.761 --> 42:36.843
This is a really
weird town.

42:36.971 --> 42:38.427
Mmm.

42:38.556 --> 42:39.921
But I like it.

42:40.683 --> 42:41.672
Kind of.

42:49.817 --> 42:50.977
(TESS CHUCKLING)

42:51.944 --> 42:54.606
I can't believe
I've never done
this before.

42:54.739 --> 42:57.071
I mean, it's amazing.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.532
Yeah, it is.

43:02.622 --> 43:03.828
UNHAUNG)

43:03.956 --> 43:04.911
Mmm.
