WEBVTT

00:02.510 --> 00:03.850
‐ Previously on "The Path"...

00:03.851 --> 00:06.686
‐ I'm sorry for everything
I have done that is wrong

00:06.687 --> 00:09.564
and everything wrong
that I do next,

00:09.565 --> 00:11.733
but you weren't supposed to die.

00:11.734 --> 00:13.110
I'm Looking into
the Meyerist Movement.

00:13.111 --> 00:14.486
I'm putting them on Cultwatch.

00:14.487 --> 00:16.238
We're talking about
a potential murder

00:16.239 --> 00:18.281
that these people
have committed.

00:18.282 --> 00:20.784
I mean, at least one.
Maybe more.

00:20.785 --> 00:23.829
‐ Silas, it's Sarah.
I've been calling you for days.

00:23.830 --> 00:26.123
I hope you come back soon.

00:26.124 --> 00:28.583
‐ Is there anything
between you and Cal?

00:28.584 --> 00:29.793
‐ No.

00:29.794 --> 00:30.000
Let the bonding of these hands

00:30.001 --> 00:32.212
Let the bonding of these hands

00:32.213 --> 00:35.257
be a symbol of the bond
that you have to each other.

00:35.258 --> 00:38.218
‐ Steve has finished writing
the last three rungs.

00:38.219 --> 00:39.594
He wants you to help shape

00:39.595 --> 00:41.221
the next phase
of The Movement with me.

00:41.222 --> 00:43.598
He wants us to be Guardians
of The Light together.

00:43.599 --> 00:45.475
‐ You wrote the rungs.
‐ What are you gonna do?

00:45.476 --> 00:47.769
‐ I'm just gonna have
to figure something else out,

00:47.770 --> 00:49.646
like where the fuck Silas is.

00:49.647 --> 00:51.606
I believe in the work
that we do,

00:51.607 --> 00:55.485
but the rest‐‐
it's just fucking fairy tales.

00:55.486 --> 00:57.445
‐ You are talking about
everything‐‐

00:57.446 --> 00:59.573
everything in my soul.

00:59.574 --> 01:00.000
‐ You don't actually
believe that.

01:00.001 --> 01:02.033
‐ You don't actually
believe that.

01:02.034 --> 01:03.451
‐ You don't know me.

01:03.452 --> 01:06.663
Daddy's gonna be living
somewhere else from now on.

01:06.664 --> 01:08.248
‐ I love you guys.

01:08.249 --> 01:11.543
Ever since I left,
I have been seeing things.

01:11.544 --> 01:14.129
‐ I think
you're having visions, Eddie.

01:14.130 --> 01:17.967
You have to find out
what they mean.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074

01:45.578 --> 01:48.539
‐

01:58.799 --> 01:59.999
‐

02:00.000 --> 02:06.265
‐

02:51.560 --> 02:54.187
‐ You!
‐ Doc.

02:54.188 --> 02:56.606
‐ Why are you here?
‐ You're sick.

02:56.607 --> 02:58.066
‐ Is someone else coming?

02:58.067 --> 02:59.999
‐ You're dying.
‐ Where is he?

03:00.000 --> 03:00.111
‐ You're dying.
‐ Where is he?

03:00.112 --> 03:01.903
‐ Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

03:01.904 --> 03:03.571
I had visions
that you were sick.

03:03.572 --> 03:05.949
‐ Visions?
‐ Yeah, so I came,

03:05.950 --> 03:08.202
and I was right.

03:10.913 --> 03:12.080
‐ We have to go.

03:12.081 --> 03:15.292
We have to go.
‐ Doc.

03:15.293 --> 03:17.252
Doc! Doc!

03:17.253 --> 03:19.671
Doc! I am not letting
you out of here.

03:19.672 --> 03:21.589
The people don't know
that you're sick.

03:21.590 --> 03:24.509
They think that you are
some immortal ball of light.

03:24.510 --> 03:26.344
You have to tell them the truth!

03:26.345 --> 03:27.762
‐ That is not the truth!

03:27.763 --> 03:29.999
‐ Look at you!
You are dead!

03:30.000 --> 03:30.307
‐ Look at you!
You are dead!

03:30.308 --> 03:32.600
You are dying!
You have to end this!

03:32.601 --> 03:34.477
End this bullshit right now!

03:34.478 --> 03:39.691
‐ We have to see what
The Light asks!

03:39.692 --> 03:40.735
‐ Doc!

03:46.949 --> 03:51.203
There is no fucking Light!

04:32.078 --> 04:35.497
We mark this sacred site,

04:35.498 --> 04:39.667
the place of Steve's
transformation.

04:39.668 --> 04:42.504
We humbly thank The Light

04:42.505 --> 04:45.716
for making him one with it.

04:47.093 --> 04:48.760
And we will do our best

04:48.761 --> 04:52.807
to be Guardians
of Steve's message.

04:59.814 --> 05:00.000
I can't believe Steve's gone.

05:00.001 --> 05:02.732
I can't believe Steve's gone.

05:02.733 --> 05:06.027
We were wrong to keep
his illness from you.

05:06.028 --> 05:09.864
But you understand why it's
important the others don't know.

05:09.865 --> 05:12.575
Maybe it was
all a part of the plan.

05:12.576 --> 05:16.037
Maybe Cal was meant
to write those rungs.

05:16.038 --> 05:18.790
Steve prophesied a miracle.

05:18.791 --> 05:22.043
Sarah, people in the village
saw him walk the streets,

05:22.044 --> 05:25.880
up this mountain,
and completely vanish.

05:25.881 --> 05:28.925
‐ That doesn't explain
where Silas is.

05:28.926 --> 05:29.999
‐ They say Steve walked
with someone.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.386
‐ They say Steve walked
with someone.

05:31.387 --> 05:34.889
Maybe Silas became one
with The Light too?

05:34.890 --> 05:37.100
‐ Richard's agreed
to stay in Cuzco

05:37.101 --> 05:39.352
to get things running again.

05:39.353 --> 05:42.814
‐ We're all dedicated
to the transition.

05:42.815 --> 05:44.691
‐ Thanks, Felicia.

05:44.692 --> 05:48.695
‐ I also asked Kodiak
to take on a bigger role.

05:48.696 --> 05:51.322
We need someone with gifts
to sit on the Council.

05:51.323 --> 05:54.367
‐ Well, Sarah, he's‐‐
‐ Controversial.

05:54.368 --> 05:59.080
‐ And has been living in Siberia
for the last 12 years.

05:59.081 --> 06:00.000
‐ He's also a 10R
who I can trust.

06:00.001 --> 06:02.459
‐ He's also a 10R
who I can trust.

06:02.460 --> 06:05.253
‐ Decisions always went
through Steve.

06:05.254 --> 06:08.256
We did what we thought was best.

06:08.257 --> 06:10.091
You'll see what it's like

06:10.092 --> 06:12.427
to have the weight
of The Movement's future

06:12.428 --> 06:13.970
on your shoulders.

06:13.971 --> 06:16.307
‐ Yes I will, Felicia.

06:32.156 --> 06:36.701
‐ How are we gonna do this
if you can't even look at me?

06:36.702 --> 06:39.454
‐ When the center opens
in the city,

06:39.455 --> 06:47.455
I imagine you'll be spending
most of your time there.

07:00.000 --> 07:08.000
I imagine you'll be spending
most of your time there.

‐ We're thankful
for all you've done,

07:59.034 --> 08:00.000
but it's not just
our livestock anymore.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.703
But it's not just
our livestock anymore.

08:00.704 --> 08:06.374
It's us.
We're sick.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.876
It's cancer.

08:08.877 --> 08:11.087
I got it.

08:11.088 --> 08:15.758
My neighbor's neighbor.

08:15.759 --> 08:21.764
Babies being born
with neurological problems.

08:21.765 --> 08:24.767
Went to the newspaper‐‐says they
can't do anything without proof.

08:24.768 --> 08:26.728
They're in DeKaan's pockets.

08:26.729 --> 08:28.604
Local government won't listen.

08:28.605 --> 08:29.999
‐ We don't involve ourselves
in government or politics.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.025
‐ We don't involve ourselves
in government or politics.

08:33.027 --> 08:35.028
We look to The Light,

08:35.029 --> 08:38.030
and we will
look to The Light for you.

08:38.032 --> 08:40.241
Okay, what do you want
to do about

08:40.241 --> 08:42.659
insulating the barn for winter?

08:42.660 --> 08:44.996
‐ Let's discuss that
at the next Council meeting.

08:44.997 --> 08:46.998
‐ Good.
You've got four new requests

08:46.999 --> 08:49.250
for speaking engagements
in Schenectady,

08:49.251 --> 08:51.169
Saratoga, Harrison,

08:51.170 --> 08:52.920
and Oberlin College.

08:52.921 --> 08:55.715
‐ Wait, Ohio?
‐ Yeah, right?

08:55.716 --> 08:57.759
The mainstream.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.999
I know I shouldn't,

09:00.000 --> 09:00.596
I know I shouldn't,

09:00.597 --> 09:05.350
but... it's almost May 14th.

09:05.351 --> 09:07.185
Firsts are rough
with any kind of loss.

09:07.186 --> 09:09.520
‐ Are you asking me if I'm gonna
let the kids see Eddie

09:09.521 --> 09:11.064
on his birthday?

09:11.065 --> 09:12.940
‐ It's just
they're finally adjusting,

09:12.941 --> 09:15.109
and everyone knows
how deeply he insulted us.

09:15.110 --> 09:17.070
It wouldn't reflect
well on you‐‐

09:17.071 --> 09:21.282
‐ I have been living according
to the word for months now, Mom.

09:21.283 --> 09:23.159
Let's bottle
200 more gallons of water

09:23.160 --> 09:27.622
and see what testing of the
water at Clarksville will cost.

09:27.623 --> 09:29.999
If The Light is
the fire, then we are the wood!

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
If The Light is
the fire, then we are the wood!

09:31.001 --> 09:34.712
Feeding the fire
until we become one with it.

09:34.713 --> 09:36.547
You've all been Possibles,

09:36.548 --> 09:39.759
and you've made the choice
to take the next step.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.762
Now we begin the real work, 1R,

09:42.763 --> 09:45.807
because when Steve
received The Ladder,

09:45.808 --> 09:48.351
the climb began with shedding

09:48.352 --> 09:51.145
all connection
to the Shadow World.

09:51.146 --> 09:53.898
So we leave behind
our possessions,

09:53.899 --> 09:58.736
our technology,
our friends and family.

09:58.737 --> 09:59.999
And it can be deeply painful‐‐

10:00.000 --> 10:01.197
And it can be deeply painful‐‐

10:01.198 --> 10:03.741
some say the most painful
rung of The Ladder.

10:03.742 --> 10:05.827
But for everything
that is left behind,

10:05.828 --> 10:07.912
something is gained,
a deeper union

10:07.913 --> 10:09.747
with truth and‐‐yes!

10:09.748 --> 10:11.374
That's the process
of letting go!

10:11.375 --> 10:13.501
We fall, but we get
back up again.

10:13.502 --> 10:18.131
'Cause when you finish 1R,
no longer will you fall.

10:18.132 --> 10:21.300
No longer will you
straddle two worlds.

10:21.301 --> 10:24.512
You will wake
from your liminal twilight

10:24.513 --> 10:26.932
and live The Ladder!

10:31.311 --> 10:36.816
How can you love
God, whom you do not see,

10:36.817 --> 10:40.486
if you do not love
your neighbor,

10:40.487 --> 10:42.656
whom you see?

10:45.367 --> 10:47.285
‐ If you need a meal...

10:47.286 --> 10:49.872
we can help.

10:56.086 --> 10:58.672
If you're looking
for another way.

11:00.132 --> 11:06.512
Love, to be true, has to hurt.

11:06.513 --> 11:09.933
It hurt Jesus to love us.

11:10.934 --> 11:13.312
It hurt.

11:14.688 --> 11:20.151
And so He made himself
the bread of life

11:20.152 --> 11:23.864
to satisfy our hunger
for His love.

12:06.657 --> 12:08.866
‐ Hi. Mary.

12:08.867 --> 12:11.118
What are you doing
in the city center?

12:11.119 --> 12:13.079
‐ I asked for a transfer
to work here.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.289
‐ Oh, great.
‐ Yeah, I think it's better

12:15.290 --> 12:17.959
for me to be close to Sean
in my condition.

12:17.960 --> 12:21.379
‐ Your condition?

12:21.380 --> 12:23.215
Pregnant?

12:24.883 --> 12:26.300
That's wonderful.

12:26.301 --> 12:29.136
Uh, how far along?

12:29.137 --> 12:30.000
‐ About five months.

12:30.000 --> 12:30.639
‐ About five months.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.557
‐ Uh‐huh.

12:32.558 --> 12:34.642
You‐‐you doin' okay with it?

12:34.643 --> 12:36.936
‐ Well, it's tough being in
the dorms, sharing a bathroom

12:36.937 --> 12:38.646
and not being able
to have food on hand.

12:38.647 --> 12:40.231
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ But, um, you know,

12:40.232 --> 12:41.649
we're making it work.

12:41.650 --> 12:45.027
‐ Hey, I was just hearing
your good news.

12:45.028 --> 12:47.822
‐ Oh, thanks.
‐ Yeah. Congratulations.

12:47.823 --> 12:55.823
‐ Yeah.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.712
‐ Yeah.

13:02.713 --> 13:05.965
Sometimes the truth
we hear inside of us

13:05.966 --> 13:09.844
is more truth than the one
written in our book,

13:09.845 --> 13:13.764
and that's the message
we have to listen to.

13:13.765 --> 13:21.765
‐ Don't worry, Mom.
I promise never to tell.

13:21.899 --> 13:23.733
‐ Get over here.

13:23.734 --> 13:27.112
Ohh! It's so good to see you.

13:32.701 --> 13:36.203
‐ Happy Birthday, Dad.
‐ Thanks, kid.

13:36.204 --> 13:38.206
Shall we?

13:59.102 --> 14:00.000
When Steve finished
the word to us,

14:00.001 --> 14:01.771
When Steve finished
the word to us,

14:01.772 --> 14:04.231
he was exhausted,

14:04.232 --> 14:05.733
be‐‐because

14:05.734 --> 14:07.318
to write the message

14:07.319 --> 14:09.028
was to live it.

14:09.029 --> 14:12.239
‐ He climbed for us,
our transgressions,

14:12.240 --> 14:13.741
our damage.

14:13.742 --> 14:18.162
‐ And Steve wasn't alone
when he made that climb.

14:18.163 --> 14:20.373
Silas walked with him.

14:20.374 --> 14:25.795
Our great shaman became one with
The Light as well,

14:25.796 --> 14:29.999
and now our Light
is more powerful than ever.

14:30.000 --> 14:38.000
And now our Light
is more powerful than ever.

14:41.770 --> 14:44.397
So how's everything?

14:44.398 --> 14:47.983
Good.

14:47.984 --> 14:51.570
‐ How's your mom?

14:51.571 --> 14:54.740
Okay, fine, I won't...

14:54.741 --> 14:58.619
ask about your mom.

14:58.620 --> 14:59.999
How's 1R?
Did you start yet?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.080
How's 1R?
Did you start yet?

15:01.081 --> 15:04.792
‐ I don't really wanna talk
about that with you either.

15:04.793 --> 15:06.001
‐ Why not?

15:06.002 --> 15:09.630
Look, just because I'm not‐‐

15:09.631 --> 15:12.758
I wanna know what's going on
in your life, kid.

15:12.759 --> 15:16.929
‐ Really? 'Cause
everyone thinks you hate us.

15:16.930 --> 15:18.556
‐ Hey.

15:18.557 --> 15:20.141
I do not hate you.

15:20.142 --> 15:23.269
‐ You're a Denier.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.729
‐ I never signed that form.

15:24.730 --> 15:27.441
‐ It doesn't matter.
You walked out.

15:31.111 --> 15:32.820
‐ So what kind of cake
you gonna have

15:32.821 --> 15:34.071
for your birthday tomorrow?

15:34.072 --> 15:36.323
‐ Mmm...

15:36.324 --> 15:40.077
what kind of cake?

15:40.078 --> 15:42.788
I think I might skip out
on the cake this year.

15:42.789 --> 15:44.165
‐ But you have to have cake.

15:44.166 --> 15:50.963
It keeps you sweet
for the rest of the year.

15:50.964 --> 15:54.341
‐ Eddie?

15:54.342 --> 15:56.135
Eddie Lane?

15:56.136 --> 15:57.136
‐ Yeah.

15:57.137 --> 15:58.971
‐ Oh, my God.
It‐‐

15:58.972 --> 15:59.999
It's‐‐it's me.
It's... it's Chloe.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.849
It's‐‐it's me.
It's... it's Chloe.

16:01.850 --> 16:04.435
It's Chloe Jones.

16:04.436 --> 16:07.104
‐ Holy shit.
‐

16:07.105 --> 16:15.105
This is, uh, my son, Johnny.

16:15.989 --> 16:19.700
We are growing
at a thrilling rate.

16:19.701 --> 16:23.621
We have over 15 people
signing up for workshops

16:23.622 --> 16:26.540
and retreats a day.

16:26.541 --> 16:29.543
We have new outposts
in Upstate New York,

16:29.544 --> 16:30.000
Bethesda, Maryland,
and outside Seattle.

16:30.001 --> 16:32.171
Bethesda, Maryland,
and outside Seattle.

16:32.172 --> 16:35.883
‐ That's great.
‐ Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

16:35.884 --> 16:38.052
Uh, and, uh, now...

16:38.053 --> 16:41.305
the opportunity to own
a building in New York City.

16:41.306 --> 16:43.849
‐ Where are we
with our finances?

16:43.850 --> 16:46.310
Well, excellent.
Current assets,

16:46.311 --> 16:49.313
not including the value
of our real estate

16:49.314 --> 16:52.024
or the investments
Cal made on our behalf,

16:52.025 --> 16:53.734
have us at about 4.2.

16:53.735 --> 16:57.446
The problem that I foresee
is we need 800 grand

16:57.447 --> 16:59.323
to pay back taxes on this place.

16:59.324 --> 17:00.000
‐ Right, except that
we are about to be

17:00.001 --> 17:01.075
‐ Right, except that
we are about to be

17:01.076 --> 17:03.077
a legitimate religion
in the eyes of the nation!

17:03.078 --> 17:04.869
‐ But we never intended
to be a religion.

17:04.871 --> 17:06.413
‐ Well, no,
it's semantics, Sarah‐‐

17:06.414 --> 17:08.082
‐ But Steven didn't want us

17:08.083 --> 17:10.166
beholden to government
regulations.

17:10.167 --> 17:13.087
‐ Religious status will not
only legitimize us

17:13.088 --> 17:16.298
but free us from the shitload
of property tax we have to pay,

17:16.299 --> 17:18.425
and we can thrive.

17:18.425 --> 17:20.301
In three years,
the building in the city

17:20.303 --> 17:21.971
will be worth a fortune.

17:21.972 --> 17:25.098
All I need is the Council
to come up with $2 million.

17:25.099 --> 17:26.809
I have the rest.
‐ Steve didn't want that.

17:26.810 --> 17:28.644
‐ Yeah, well, Steve isn't here.

17:28.645 --> 17:29.999
All right? We have to make
the decisions now.

17:30.000 --> 17:38.000
All right? We have to make
the decisions now.

17:43.451 --> 17:46.245
We can't keep going on
like this.

17:46.246 --> 17:47.955
The Council thinks we're a mess,

17:47.956 --> 17:49.623
and soon everyone else
will think that too.

17:49.624 --> 17:52.168
‐ Look, I have learned to live
with most of your lies,

17:52.169 --> 17:57.006
but I won't accept
your story about Silas.

17:57.007 --> 17:59.999
‐ People... saw it happen,
Sarah.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.302
‐ People... saw it happen,
Sarah.

18:00.303 --> 18:03.262
‐ You should have just
put yourself in charge, Cal.

18:03.263 --> 18:07.474
It's what you really wanted.

18:07.475 --> 18:14.398
‐ Sarah‐‐

18:14.399 --> 18:16.609
‐

18:16.610 --> 18:18.444
Mr. Pinto.
‐ Pinto.

18:18.445 --> 18:19.987
‐ He taught algebra, right?

18:19.988 --> 18:21.363
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yes.

18:21.364 --> 18:23.157
Yes, I remember him.
Oh, my God.

18:23.158 --> 18:25.701
We used to make all those
fart sounds around him.

18:25.702 --> 18:27.286
‐ We were so dumb.
‐ Remember that?

18:27.287 --> 18:29.999
Oh, my God.
We were so dumb.

18:30.000 --> 18:30.123
Oh, my God.
We were so dumb.

18:30.124 --> 18:32.208
‐ I... I don't...

18:32.209 --> 18:33.584
I don't get it.

18:33.585 --> 18:35.336
‐ It's‐‐
‐ Oh, there's nothing to get.

18:35.337 --> 18:36.837
‐ Yeah.
‐ It's like 'cause his name

18:36.838 --> 18:39.840
was Pinto, you know, like
the bean, so we just‐‐

18:39.841 --> 18:42.635
We made so much fun of him.
‐ It was so stupid.

18:42.636 --> 18:47.681
Pinto and Butkiss
got such crap, right?

18:47.682 --> 18:49.516
‐ Yeah.
‐ Remember Benson Butkiss?

18:49.517 --> 18:52.061
‐ Yeah, I do.
I sure do.

18:52.062 --> 18:53.896
I married him.

18:53.897 --> 18:55.272
‐ No.
‐ Yeah.

18:55.273 --> 18:57.691
‐ You married Benson?
‐ Yes, I did.

18:57.692 --> 18:58.859
Yes.
‐ Wow.

18:58.860 --> 18:59.999
‐ He's the father of my child.

19:00.000 --> 19:00.570
‐ He's the father of my child.

19:00.571 --> 19:05.157
‐ Wow. Wow.
‐ Yeah, I just, uh...

19:05.158 --> 19:08.077
I needed something...

19:08.078 --> 19:11.205
solid, I guess, after Johnny.

19:11.206 --> 19:14.166
‐ Yeah.
‐ It was good for a while,

19:14.167 --> 19:16.418
but we just...

19:16.419 --> 19:22.549
we weren't soul mates, you know?

19:22.550 --> 19:24.385
Johnny, honey,
you're getting all burned.

19:24.386 --> 19:26.553
Can you come sit with us
under the umbrella

19:26.554 --> 19:27.888
for a second, please?

19:27.889 --> 19:29.999
‐ I didn't even
pack anything for Summer.

19:30.000 --> 19:30.475
‐ I didn't even
pack anything for Summer.

19:30.476 --> 19:31.934
‐ Oh, it's all right. I got‐‐
‐ You okay?

19:31.935 --> 19:34.228
‐ I got some. Here.

19:34.229 --> 19:35.980
‐ Thank you.

19:35.981 --> 19:38.816
‐ Guess your wife didn't pack
your beach bag this morning.

19:38.817 --> 19:41.402
‐ Actually...

19:41.403 --> 19:44.655
I'm separated.

19:44.656 --> 19:47.783
‐ Oh.
‐ Let's go in the water, Daddy.

19:47.784 --> 19:51.120
‐ Okay.
‐ Come on, let's go!

19:51.121 --> 19:54.748
Come on, let's go in the water!

19:54.749 --> 19:57.001
‐ Dad, what happened
to your arm?

19:57.002 --> 19:59.999
‐ Oh, it's, um... accident, work.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.425
‐ Oh, it's, um... accident, work.

20:04.426 --> 20:06.719
- How is it?
- Mm!

20:06.720 --> 20:08.429
We express deepest gratitude

20:08.430 --> 20:10.431
for this day and every day,

20:10.432 --> 20:12.308
for the gift of this passage

20:12.309 --> 20:14.268
and that we have found
The Ladder.

20:14.269 --> 20:19.606
There is one spirit
whose name is Truth.

20:19.607 --> 20:22.776
‐ And let's send some extra Love
and Light to Joy,

20:22.777 --> 20:24.737
who leaves tomorrow for 3R.

20:24.738 --> 20:29.950
‐ Love and Light.
‐ We are so proud of you, hon.

20:29.951 --> 20:30.000
‐ I'm gonna actually miss you.
‐ Actually miss me?

20:30.001 --> 20:33.496
‐ I'm gonna actually miss you.
‐ Actually miss me?

20:34.622 --> 20:35.914
‐ Are you crying?

20:35.915 --> 20:37.333
‐ Who's crying?
‐ I'm not crying!

20:37.334 --> 20:39.626
‐ Mom, I'm gonna see you
in three months.

20:39.627 --> 20:42.296
‐ No, I...
I am so happy for you.

20:42.297 --> 20:44.798
It's just
who am I gonna talk to now?

20:44.799 --> 20:47.176
‐ Well, what about me?
You can talk to me.

20:47.177 --> 20:48.970
Jeez, thanks a lot.

20:51.639 --> 20:55.142
‐ Are you going with Cal
to the auction tomorrow?

20:55.143 --> 20:57.853
I'd like you to keep
an eye on him for me.

20:57.854 --> 20:59.855
‐ I'm not your spy, Sarah.

20:59.856 --> 21:00.000
‐ What are you guys
fighting about?

21:00.000 --> 21:00.982
‐ What are you guys
fighting about?

21:00.983 --> 21:02.524
‐ Nothing.

21:02.525 --> 21:04.651
I just found out my wife
hates talking to me

21:04.652 --> 21:06.362
and my sister
wants me to spy for her.

21:06.363 --> 21:09.948
‐ Oh, yeah?
Who does she want you to spy on?

21:09.949 --> 21:11.283
‐ Cal.

21:11.284 --> 21:13.410
You have a problem with him,
you deal with it.

21:13.411 --> 21:14.995
‐ Why don't you trust Cal,
Sarah?

21:14.996 --> 21:17.706
‐ I just asked Russel to keep
an eye on him for me tomorrow

21:17.707 --> 21:19.083
at the auction, that's all‐‐

21:19.084 --> 21:21.210
‐ You know, I'm starting not
to trust him either.

21:21.211 --> 21:23.962
I just can't shake
Kodiak's words.

21:23.963 --> 21:26.340
He said, "The building
will consume us."

21:26.341 --> 21:28.509
‐ Your mother's always had
a thing for Kodiak.

21:28.510 --> 21:29.999
‐ That is so‐‐don't.

21:30.000 --> 21:30.595
‐ That is so‐‐don't.

21:30.596 --> 21:32.721
‐ This is the worst
send‐off dinner ever.

21:32.722 --> 21:34.932
‐ It's hard to have
two people in charge.

21:34.933 --> 21:36.517
Steve should have
just picked one of you.

21:36.518 --> 21:40.771
‐ Steve doesn't pick, Mom.
The Light picks.

21:40.772 --> 21:44.400
‐ You look like you got
some sun, honey.

21:44.401 --> 21:45.692
You got sun? What?

21:45.693 --> 21:47.486
Why are you
looking at me like that?

21:47.487 --> 21:50.322
‐ I went somewhere.
‐ I took Summer to the beach.

21:50.323 --> 21:52.699
‐ Oh, that's fun.
Where'd you guys go?

21:52.700 --> 21:54.451
‐ Down by the river.

21:54.452 --> 21:58.163
So not...
not really the beach.

21:58.164 --> 21:59.665
‐

21:59.666 --> 22:00.000
‐ Just down by the river.

22:00.001 --> 22:01.750
‐ Just down by the river.

22:01.751 --> 22:07.841
‐ Cool.

22:13.972 --> 22:19.226
‐ Some people from the village
found him two days ago.

22:19.227 --> 22:22.479
‐ What about Silas?
‐ The word was...

22:22.480 --> 22:26.567
is that he became one
with The Light with Steve.

22:26.568 --> 22:29.999
Only Steve... didn't become
one with The Light.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.840
Only Steve... didn't become
one with The Light.

22:41.166 --> 22:44.918
He must have fallen.

22:44.919 --> 22:48.213
This puts the entire Movement
in jeopardy.

22:48.214 --> 22:52.259
I paid the locals
to keep it quiet.

22:52.260 --> 22:54.636
We'll cremate him tonight,

22:54.637 --> 22:57.264
but I wanted you
to see him first.

22:57.265 --> 22:59.999
I don't know who else
we can trust.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.562
I don't know who else
we can trust.

23:44.896 --> 23:47.564
‐ Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
Can you look at my baby?

23:47.565 --> 23:48.480
‐ Well, I'm sorry, ma'am,
we're not doctors.

23:48.480 --> 23:49.400
‐ Well, I'm sorry, ma'am,
we're not doctors.

23:49.401 --> 23:51.735
We're just came to bring water.
‐ But look at her skin.

23:51.736 --> 23:57.741
It doesn't look right, does it?

23:57.742 --> 24:00.702
‐ Ma'am, if you'd like,
we can take you to the hospital.

24:00.703 --> 24:04.831
‐ We've already been.
They sent us home.

24:04.832 --> 24:08.627
‐ Listen, don't let her drink
from the tap.

24:08.628 --> 24:13.549
Nowhere near it.
Not even baths, do you hear me?

24:13.550 --> 24:18.345
Go back to the van and get her
some more water, okay?

24:18.346 --> 24:18.480
‐ This is so messed up.
We should be doing more.

24:18.481 --> 24:20.931
‐ This is so messed up.
We should be doing more.

24:20.932 --> 24:22.140
‐ Like what?
‐ I don't know.

24:22.141 --> 24:23.767
You're supposed
to have the answers.

24:23.768 --> 24:26.144
Distributing water is cool,
but it's just a Band‐Aid.

24:26.145 --> 24:27.688
It does nothing
to fix the wound.

24:27.689 --> 24:29.940
If it were up to me,
I'd blow up the DeKaan house

24:29.941 --> 24:34.861
or force them to drink
their own poison water.

24:34.862 --> 24:37.114
What?

24:37.115 --> 24:41.201
‐ You're intense.

24:41.202 --> 24:43.996
‐ I got sick
of just sitting around NYU

24:43.997 --> 24:45.872
talking about the shit wrong
with the world,

24:45.873 --> 24:48.479
and I actually wanted
to do something about it.

24:48.480 --> 24:49.835
And I actually wanted
to do something about it.

24:49.836 --> 24:52.254
It must have been nice
growing up in a family

24:52.255 --> 24:57.134
that was actually committed
to the stuff that matters.

24:57.135 --> 24:59.511
Oh, right, your dad.
I've heard the rumors.

24:59.512 --> 25:01.722
He's like a heathen, right?

25:01.723 --> 25:02.973
‐ I guess.

25:02.974 --> 25:10.974
‐ Well, at least you have
one kick‐ass parent.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.736
Bidding will begin
on the building at 899 Flatbush,

25:15.737 --> 25:17.654
starting at 3.5 million.

25:17.655 --> 25:18.480
Do I hear 3.5 million?

25:18.481 --> 25:24.578
Do I hear 3.5 million?

25:24.579 --> 25:26.913
3.5 million.

25:26.914 --> 25:29.124
3.6 million.

25:29.125 --> 25:31.084
‐ I guess
there's another bidder.

25:31.085 --> 25:32.586
‐ Do I hear 3.8 million?

25:32.587 --> 25:34.254
‐ All right. That should do it.
‐ 3.8 million.

25:34.255 --> 25:35.756
I have 3.8 million.

25:35.757 --> 25:37.424
4 million. 4 million.
I have 4 million dollars.

25:37.425 --> 25:40.719
‐ I think we should stop there.
‐ Do I hear 4.2? 4.2?

25:40.720 --> 25:43.347
‐ We don't have the cash.
‐ 4.4?

25:43.348 --> 25:45.098
Do I hear 4.4?
‐ This is it, all right?

25:45.099 --> 25:46.308
‐ Please‐‐okay.
‐ Stop, stop.

25:46.309 --> 25:48.185
‐ 4.6?
‐ What are you doing, Cal?

25:48.186 --> 25:48.480
‐ Do I have 4.8?

25:48.481 --> 25:50.604
‐ Do I have 4.8?

25:50.605 --> 25:52.022
4.8. I have 4.8.
‐ No. Okay.

25:52.023 --> 25:53.440
Just leave it at that, please.

25:53.441 --> 25:54.691
‐ Okay, we're done.
‐ 5.

25:54.692 --> 25:56.568
‐ We're done.
‐ $5 million,

25:56.569 --> 25:58.612
going once...

25:58.613 --> 26:00.447
going twice,

26:00.448 --> 26:02.949
going three times.

26:02.950 --> 26:05.952
Sold property at 899 Flatbush.

26:05.953 --> 26:08.789
Sold to bidder number 137.

26:08.790 --> 26:11.124
Next thing we have on our list

26:11.125 --> 26:15.296
are the Brooklyn Condominiums,
property 8532.

26:23.888 --> 26:27.307
‐ Hey. What's going on?

26:27.308 --> 26:30.686
‐ This isn't good for us.

26:30.687 --> 26:32.771
Lying to everyone.
It's not good for me.

26:32.772 --> 26:34.272
I don't think it's easy
for you to live with,

26:34.273 --> 26:38.819
and it is definitely
not good for Summer.

26:38.820 --> 26:40.904
‐ I don't know
what's good anymore, Hawk.

26:40.905 --> 26:42.656
‐ That's not fair.

26:42.657 --> 26:44.616
‐ Things got more complicated‐‐
‐ No, you cannot

26:44.617 --> 26:47.327
say that to me,
not after everything.

26:47.328 --> 26:48.479
‐ What do you want me to say?

26:48.480 --> 26:49.247
‐ What do you want me to say?

26:49.248 --> 26:52.124
You want me to say that you
can't see your father anymore?

26:52.125 --> 26:57.337
Because I can't do that.

26:57.338 --> 27:00.507
Hawk?

27:00.508 --> 27:05.470
Hawk?

27:05.471 --> 27:07.723
‐ Hey, Nicole.
‐ Hey.

27:07.724 --> 27:09.516
‐ Nice dress.
‐ Thank you.

27:09.517 --> 27:11.393
‐ Got the new T‐shirts.
‐ Good.

27:11.394 --> 27:15.772
Yeah, Cal wanted the collars.

27:15.773 --> 27:17.023
I don't know.

27:17.024 --> 27:18.479
‐ Oh.
‐ They seem so corporate.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.193
‐ Oh.
‐ They seem so corporate.

27:19.194 --> 27:21.319
‐ No, I kind of like 'em.
I think they're cool.

27:21.320 --> 27:23.531
‐ Yeah?
‐ Yeah, if you play golf.

27:24.991 --> 27:27.325
Do you want me to stock 'em?
‐ Oh, my God. Would you?

27:27.326 --> 27:29.703
‐ Okay.
‐ I am comatose.

27:29.704 --> 27:31.329
The baby kept me up all night.

27:31.330 --> 27:36.418
I swear, I was this close to
shoving a pillow over her face.

27:36.419 --> 27:39.296
Oh, I‐‐I'm sorry.

27:39.297 --> 27:41.715
I am so sorry.
‐ No, hey, listen‐‐

27:41.716 --> 27:43.383
No. It's‐‐
‐ Horrible.

27:43.384 --> 27:45.135
Horrible to say that to you.

27:45.136 --> 27:46.887
‐ Nicole‐‐ ‐ I love my children.

27:46.888 --> 27:48.479
I should remember how blessed
I am and not say stupid jokes.

27:48.480 --> 27:49.307
I should remember how blessed
I am and not say stupid jokes.

27:49.308 --> 27:51.224
‐ I'm relieved that you make
stupid jokes.

27:51.225 --> 27:52.893
Really, I am.
The rest of the world

27:52.894 --> 27:55.562
treats me
like they're on eggshells.

27:55.563 --> 27:58.648
‐ Well, I just...

27:58.649 --> 28:01.109
think about you all the time.

28:01.110 --> 28:03.153
What it must have been like.

28:03.154 --> 28:05.197
You leave the hospital,

28:05.198 --> 28:13.198
you think everything is better,
and...

28:18.480 --> 28:26.480
you think everything is better,
and...

28:30.431 --> 28:33.058
‐ I can't.
‐ Yeah. Yeah.

28:33.059 --> 28:37.646
I'm sorry.
I just...

28:37.647 --> 28:39.940
I feel so close to you
these last few months.

28:39.941 --> 28:44.277
‐ No, I know.
I know, but...

28:44.278 --> 28:46.530
Uh, it's... it's not right.

28:46.531 --> 28:48.479
I have to... go.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.033
I have to... go.

28:49.034 --> 28:57.034
‐ Okay.

29:01.462 --> 29:03.505
Man, I'm gonna need
a beer after today.

29:03.506 --> 29:06.216
‐ You mind if I come
join you guys?

29:06.217 --> 29:09.386
‐ Hey, he wants to have
a beer with us.

29:09.387 --> 29:11.680
And I thought you were
too good for us,

29:11.681 --> 29:15.976
being one with The Light
and all that.

29:15.977 --> 29:18.311
‐ You know what?
It's fine.

29:18.312 --> 29:18.480
I don't need to.

29:18.481 --> 29:20.146
I don't need to.

29:20.147 --> 29:22.065
And I'm not too good for anyone.

29:22.066 --> 29:24.318
‐ Dude, I'm fucking with you.

29:28.322 --> 29:29.990
‐ All right. Great.

29:29.991 --> 29:34.703
And just so you know, I'm not
one of them anymore either, so‐‐

29:34.704 --> 29:40.125
‐ Come on.
I'll give you a ride.

29:40.126 --> 29:43.169
‐ It's not much, but our guests
always find it comfortable.

29:43.170 --> 29:45.589
I don't know
where they'll stay now.

29:45.590 --> 29:46.923
Look at this bed.

29:46.924 --> 29:48.479
It'll actually fit
the both of us.

29:48.480 --> 29:49.051
It'll actually fit
the both of us.

29:49.052 --> 29:51.636
‐ Thank you so much.
‐ Oh, don't thank me.

29:51.637 --> 29:53.471
We got urgent word
from up on high

29:53.472 --> 29:56.474
that the expectant parents
needed to be out of the dorms.

29:56.475 --> 29:57.851
‐ Up on high?

29:57.852 --> 30:04.149
‐ I guess someone's
making an impression.

30:04.150 --> 30:05.692
‐ The thing you got to do,

30:05.693 --> 30:09.362
what's really important is
to get back out there.

30:09.363 --> 30:11.906
My first divorce,
I let it wreck me.

30:11.907 --> 30:14.409
I spent, like,
two years just crying.

30:14.410 --> 30:17.662
I think about that now,
and I'm not gonna get

30:17.663 --> 30:18.480
that time back, you know?
‐ Yeah.

30:18.481 --> 30:19.914
That time back, you know?
‐ Yeah.

30:19.915 --> 30:21.708
‐ Anyway, that's my advice
to you.

30:21.709 --> 30:23.084
‐ How many times
you been married?

30:23.085 --> 30:24.711
‐ He's on three.

30:24.712 --> 30:26.921
‐ See, I just get
back out there.

30:26.922 --> 30:31.217
‐ There you go.
Well, thank you.

30:31.218 --> 30:34.220
You know, on that note, I...

30:34.221 --> 30:37.141
I'm gonna go make a call.

30:54.575 --> 30:55.742
Hey.

30:55.743 --> 30:59.871
Um... hi.

30:59.872 --> 31:05.669
It was, uh‐‐it was great
to see you the other day.

31:05.670 --> 31:07.128
Um...

31:07.129 --> 31:09.422
‐ Sarah!

31:09.423 --> 31:12.050
‐ Hey, I was just going
to pick up Summer for dinner.

31:12.051 --> 31:13.426
‐ You're not gonna believe this.

31:13.427 --> 31:15.970
I just came from the auction.
Cal‐‐

31:15.971 --> 31:18.473
‐ Shit.
What did he buy it for?

31:18.474 --> 31:18.480
‐ 5.
‐ 5? $5 million?

31:18.481 --> 31:20.642
‐ 5.
‐ 5? $5 million?

31:20.643 --> 31:22.227
We don't have $5 million.

31:22.228 --> 31:26.022
Jesus Russel, how could you
let this happen?

31:26.023 --> 31:27.941
‐ How could you put me
in that position?

31:27.942 --> 31:30.276
‐ I was trying to delegate
some responsibility, Russel‐‐

31:30.277 --> 31:34.614
‐ No, you were giving me
your dirty work, and it's dirty.

31:34.615 --> 31:36.950
All right, whatever the hell
is going on between you guys,

31:36.951 --> 31:38.118
you need to figure it out

31:38.119 --> 31:39.704
because it's messing
all of us up.

31:43.332 --> 31:46.084
‐ I have to go.
‐ Sarah, wait‐‐

31:46.085 --> 31:48.479
‐ Just‐‐
‐ Who is it? Are you okay?

31:48.480 --> 31:56.480
‐ Just‐‐
‐ Who is it? Are you okay?

32:13.904 --> 32:18.479
Hey. Um, hi.

32:18.480 --> 32:18.743
Hey. Um, hi.

32:18.744 --> 32:20.410
It was, uh...

32:20.411 --> 32:22.662
it was great
to see you the other day.

32:22.663 --> 32:24.205
Listen, I just wanted to call

32:24.206 --> 32:30.086
and say thanks
for letting me see the kids.

32:30.087 --> 32:33.507
I know it must be hard
breaking the rules.

32:35.509 --> 32:37.469
I mean, it's not in your DNA,

32:37.470 --> 32:39.596
so I just wanted to...

32:39.597 --> 32:42.932
just thank you, Sarah.

32:42.933 --> 32:45.852
Anyways, I, um,

32:45.853 --> 32:46.812
you know‐‐

32:46.813 --> 32:47.855
‐

33:22.389 --> 33:24.642
Oh, no.

34:10.062 --> 34:12.938
‐ Sarah, are you okay?

34:12.940 --> 34:14.357
What happened?

34:14.358 --> 34:17.944
‐ I hit her.
‐ Okay.

34:17.945 --> 34:20.697
‐ I killed her.

34:20.697 --> 34:24.742
Because of you.

34:24.743 --> 34:30.290
‐ Because of me?
‐ Yes, because of you.

34:30.291 --> 34:34.377
Because you just spent
$5 million that we don't have,

34:34.378 --> 34:37.630
because I don't know
what I believe anymore,

34:37.630 --> 34:37.712
and I don't know who I am.

34:37.713 --> 34:39.132
And I don't know who I am.

34:39.132 --> 34:40.800
‐ No, that's not true.
You know who you are‐‐

34:40.801 --> 34:44.554
‐ No! You have turned me
into a fucking hypocrite,

34:44.554 --> 34:46.806
and I'm standing there
in front of people

34:46.806 --> 34:49.266
telling some story
I don't even know is true.

34:49.268 --> 34:51.686
‐ No, I‐I didn't know
if it was true either.

34:51.687 --> 34:54.313
Believe me,
when‐‐when Steve got sick,

34:54.315 --> 34:56.940
I was terrified
that it was all a story,

34:56.942 --> 35:01.571
that... that I had devoted
my life to a story.

35:01.572 --> 35:05.575
But then Steve
went into The Light.

35:05.576 --> 35:07.660
He vanished!

35:07.661 --> 35:07.712
So it has to be true.
That's proof, isn't it?

35:07.713 --> 35:11.789
So it has to be true.
That's proof, isn't it?

35:11.790 --> 35:14.167
‐ What about Silas?
‐

35:14.168 --> 35:22.168
‐ Look at me and tell me
you believe Silas went with him.

35:23.052 --> 35:24.552
‐ I don't know about Silas,

35:24.553 --> 35:28.473
but as long
as the work is real...

35:28.474 --> 35:30.059
‐ You sound just like Eddie.

35:32.186 --> 35:34.479
You took the truth from me.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.689
I am so lost now.

35:36.690 --> 35:37.711
And I killed a fucking deer,

35:37.712 --> 35:39.984
And I killed a fucking deer,

35:39.985 --> 35:42.237
and all I want is the truth,

35:42.238 --> 35:45.616
and I have this feeling
in my gut‐‐

36:25.656 --> 36:33.656
‐ Come on. Get in.
‐ Where are we going?

36:37.712 --> 36:39.752
‐ Come on. Get in.
‐ Where are we going?

36:39.753 --> 36:41.296
‐ Hey.
‐ Hi.

36:41.297 --> 36:47.593
‐ What's going on?

36:47.594 --> 36:50.263
Can I have a puff?

36:50.264 --> 36:57.770
‐ Sure.

36:57.771 --> 36:59.647
‐

36:59.648 --> 37:01.524
‐

37:01.525 --> 37:07.711
Try again.
I don't think you got anything.

37:07.712 --> 37:12.785
Try again.
I don't think you got anything.

37:12.786 --> 37:20.786
‐
‐

37:32.264 --> 37:35.016
Since I was a little kid,
I always, like,

37:35.017 --> 37:37.310
had too much empathy.

37:37.311 --> 37:37.712
I would see pictures
in the newspaper of people...

37:37.713 --> 37:41.647
I would see pictures
in the newspaper of people...

37:41.648 --> 37:49.648
in an earthquake or a war
and just obsess.

37:49.823 --> 37:53.534
I can't stop thinking
about that baby today.

37:53.535 --> 37:54.994
I think that's maybe
why I want to do

37:54.995 --> 37:57.121
something so bad, you know?

37:57.122 --> 38:05.122
Maybe if I do something, it'll
keep me from feeling so much.

38:06.256 --> 38:07.711
‐ I can feel the lives
of so many dead people

38:07.712 --> 38:08.841
‐ I can feel the lives
of so many dead people

38:08.842 --> 38:12.178
under the ground.

38:12.179 --> 38:14.306
‐ You're totally stoned.

38:30.406 --> 38:37.711
‐ Let's do something.

38:37.712 --> 38:38.712
‐ Let's do something.

39:08.444 --> 39:16.444
They're gonna lose their shit.

39:16.743 --> 39:18.244
Hawk.

39:18.245 --> 39:19.704
‐ That is so messed up.

39:19.705 --> 39:21.456
They get to live in this castle

39:21.457 --> 39:23.916
while their factories
are poisoning people's water.

39:23.917 --> 39:29.422
I mean, who gets
to make these choices?

39:29.423 --> 39:31.424
Some of us are just
like these pawns

39:31.425 --> 39:34.385
and just victims
of everyone else's shit!

39:34.386 --> 39:37.221
‐ Wait, Hawk,
what are you doing?

39:37.222 --> 39:37.712
We're gonna get caught.
You can't do that.

39:37.713 --> 39:39.600
We're gonna get caught.
You can't do that.

39:48.442 --> 39:49.902
‐ Fuck you, DeKaans!

39:58.869 --> 40:02.038
Where are we going?

40:02.039 --> 40:03.956
Cal, stop.
‐ We're almost there.

40:03.957 --> 40:07.711
‐ No.
I don't want to go any further.

40:07.712 --> 40:08.295
‐ No.
I don't want to go any further.

40:08.296 --> 40:10.838
Where are we going?

40:10.839 --> 40:12.799
You're scaring me.

40:25.854 --> 40:28.481
‐ Uh...

40:28.482 --> 40:36.482
Silas is here.

40:37.324 --> 40:37.712
It was an accident,
but‐‐but he was already gone.

40:37.713 --> 40:40.701
It was an accident,
but‐‐but he was already gone.

40:40.702 --> 40:42.119
He was gonna end The Movement.

40:42.120 --> 40:44.998
‐ What?
‐ Um...

40:46.333 --> 40:48.834
He looked inside me

40:48.835 --> 40:51.837
and he was telling me
that I was nothing,

40:51.838 --> 40:59.011
I was an alcoholic salesman,
and I‐I‐I, um...

40:59.012 --> 41:01.514
It was an accident‐‐
‐ Are you saying you killed‐‐

41:01.515 --> 41:03.558
‐ No, I didn't mean to‐‐ ‐ You‐‐

41:03.559 --> 41:07.687
‐ My‐my mind just went black
with‐‐with rage, a‐and...

41:07.688 --> 41:07.712
‐ Are you fucking crazy?

41:07.713 --> 41:10.022
‐ Are you fucking crazy?

41:10.023 --> 41:11.899
‐ I‐I‐it's complicated
to explain,

41:11.900 --> 41:17.572
but I didn't mean to do it.

41:17.573 --> 41:20.533
Now I live with it...

41:20.534 --> 41:22.410
and it is hell.

41:22.411 --> 41:25.871
I don't‐‐I don't want to live
like this anymore.

41:25.872 --> 41:28.207
‐ Oh, my God.

41:28.208 --> 41:31.253
‐ I don't want to live with
the way that you look at me.

41:33.672 --> 41:37.711
‐ He's here?

41:37.712 --> 41:37.884
‐ He's here?

41:37.885 --> 41:40.636
Silas is here?

41:40.637 --> 41:46.892
I don't believe you.

41:46.893 --> 41:51.147
Dig him up.

41:51.148 --> 41:54.567
I need to know.

41:54.568 --> 41:59.323
Dig him up!

42:40.656 --> 42:45.576
‐ There's a boy who says
his grandfather saw the fall.

42:45.577 --> 42:53.577
The grandfather drew a picture.

42:54.709 --> 43:02.709
The grandfather drew a picture.

43:53.437 --> 43:54.708
‐ Hey. You look good.

43:54.709 --> 44:00.860
‐ Hey. You look good.

44:00.861 --> 44:02.611
‐ Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
‐ Ohh!

44:02.612 --> 44:05.365
They got me!
They got me! They got me!

44:07.200 --> 44:14.039
Oh, I missed you guys so much.

44:14.040 --> 44:22.040
Where's the baby?

44:24.709 --> 44:29.388
Where's the baby?

44:29.389 --> 44:33.642
Ohh...

44:33.643 --> 44:35.978
Hello, little love.

44:35.979 --> 44:37.229
Mmm.

44:37.230 --> 44:40.316
Oh, my God,
you've gotten so big.

44:40.317 --> 44:43.152
I missed you so much.

44:43.153 --> 44:50.534
I did.

44:50.535 --> 44:54.708
I missed you so much too, baby.

44:54.709 --> 45:01.837
I missed you so much too, baby.

45:01.838 --> 45:03.422
I had to go back in.

45:03.423 --> 45:07.843
They put me on a desk job,
and I was just‐‐I was gonna die.

45:07.844 --> 45:13.015
This was my shot to do something
big with my life,

45:13.016 --> 45:15.267
with our life.

45:15.268 --> 45:23.268
‐ If we still have a life, Abe.

45:24.069 --> 45:24.709
‐ I promise it's almost over.

45:24.710 --> 45:26.946
‐ I promise it's almost over.

45:26.947 --> 45:34.947
Okay? I promise you
I will be home soon.

47:21.937 --> 47:24.708
‐ He's deaf.

47:24.709 --> 47:24.773
‐ He's deaf.

47:24.774 --> 47:27.107
‐ Who is this?

47:27.108 --> 47:35.108
Is this a shaman?

47:37.744 --> 47:40.371
‐ He didn't fall.
He was pushed.

47:40.372 --> 47:45.126
He says it was a white man.
‐ The man who killed Steve.

47:57.681 --> 47:59.723
‐ You woke me!

47:59.724 --> 48:01.475
I was dead, and you woke me.

48:01.476 --> 48:05.438
I picked a son,
but he was the wrong son.

48:07.273 --> 48:11.193
I thought I was being punished,
but it was a test.

48:11.194 --> 48:12.695
It must have been a test.

48:12.696 --> 48:16.115
And now I will receive
the last three rungs!

48:16.116 --> 48:19.034
‐ Doc! Doc! This is crazy.

48:19.035 --> 48:21.495
‐ The son would come

48:21.496 --> 48:24.708
and the message
would be finished!

48:24.709 --> 48:25.083
And the message
would be finished!

48:25.084 --> 48:29.003
And I would become
one with The Light!

48:29.004 --> 48:33.590
‐ What son?

48:33.591 --> 48:35.843
‐ You.

48:35.844 --> 48:38.387
You're the son.

48:38.388 --> 48:42.766
You.

48:42.767 --> 48:44.018
The chosen son!

48:44.019 --> 48:45.644
Chosen... chosen...

48:45.645 --> 48:46.895
son.

48:46.896 --> 48:48.690
