01:31.807 --> 01:33.247
Is that them?

01:36.287 --> 01:37.814
Jesus Christ.

01:37.887 --> 01:40.255
Are they going to do it right here?

01:45.847 --> 01:47.767
You guys ever been through this before?

01:48.367 --> 01:49.446
No.

01:50.247 --> 01:53.766
It's best to ignore it, keep your
head down, and go back to work.

01:53.767 --> 01:54.814
Go on.

02:01.367 --> 02:02.775
Don't watch.

02:21.607 --> 02:23.047
Timothy Singh?

02:23.606 --> 02:26.171
- Yes.
- I'm afraid we have to speak with you.

02:26.246 --> 02:27.294
Come.

02:41.846 --> 02:43.166
Eric Dale?

02:43.846 --> 02:44.966
Excuse me?

02:44.967 --> 02:46.134
Eric Dale?

02:47.406 --> 02:48.770
- No.
- Sorry?

02:49.367 --> 02:50.567
I'm not Eric Dale.

02:50.846 --> 02:52.691
I'm so sorry.

02:52.766 --> 02:53.846
He's my boss.

02:54.446 --> 02:56.093
He's down the hall.

02:56.166 --> 02:57.290
Thanks.

03:11.646 --> 03:13.926
Excuse me, Mr. Dale?

03:14.885 --> 03:16.129
This way.

03:24.526 --> 03:25.769
Okay.

04:03.845 --> 04:06.813
I am obviously sorry
that we are here today.

04:06.885 --> 04:11.130
But these are extraordinary times,
as you very well must know.

04:11.845 --> 04:14.124
Look, I run Risk Management.

04:14.125 --> 04:17.324
I don't really see how that's a
natural place to start cutting jobs.

04:17.325 --> 04:19.692
We hope you understand
this is in no way personal.

04:19.694 --> 04:22.729
The majority of this floor
is being let go today.

04:25.165 --> 04:28.689
Ms. Bratberg is now going to run through
the details of what the firm is offering.

04:30.365 --> 04:31.609
Okay.

04:31.684 --> 04:36.006
Mr. Dale, the firm is offering you
a six-month severance at half your salary.

04:36.325 --> 04:39.844
You will keep all unvested options
that you currently hold.

04:39.845 --> 04:41.765
Health will be extended
through that period.

04:41.844 --> 04:47.485
You have until tomorrow at 4:47 to either
take the offer or it will be revoked.

04:48.004 --> 04:49.171
Do you understand?

04:50.685 --> 04:51.732
Yes.

04:52.404 --> 04:53.923
Unfortunately, Mr. Dale,

04:53.924 --> 04:56.412
due to the highly sensitive nature
of your work here,

04:56.485 --> 04:59.843
the firm has to take certain precautions
for security purposes

04:59.844 --> 05:03.403
that may seem punitive in nature.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.324
I hope, considering your

05:07.204 --> 05:09.644
over 19 years of service to the firm,

05:09.645 --> 05:12.843
you will understand that these measures
are in no way a reflection

05:12.844 --> 05:15.289
of the firm's feelings
towards your performance

05:15.724 --> 05:17.404
or your character.

05:18.165 --> 05:19.845
I don't understand.

05:20.724 --> 05:23.932
She's apologizing
for what's about to happen.

05:24.684 --> 05:28.405
Your company e-mail, access to the server,
access to the building,

05:28.484 --> 05:33.165
and your mobile data and phone service
will all be severed as of this meeting.

05:33.644 --> 05:36.972
And this gentleman
will take you to your office

05:37.044 --> 05:39.412
so you can clear out
your personal belongings.

05:43.164 --> 05:47.092
What about what I'm currently working on?
I'm in the middle of something that...

05:47.164 --> 05:51.725
The firm has worked out its transition plan
and is prepared to move forward.

05:51.804 --> 05:54.248
But we do appreciate your concern.

05:54.324 --> 05:58.372
We understand that this is difficult.
And here is my card.

05:59.004 --> 06:00.325
Please contact me in the next few weeks

06:00.326 --> 06:02.724
if you need any assistance
with this transition in your life.

06:08.923 --> 06:09.927
Sir.

06:16.684 --> 06:17.764
Okay.

06:19.203 --> 06:20.327
Okay.

06:22.123 --> 06:23.203
Okay.

06:48.683 --> 06:49.730
Hey.

06:55.163 --> 06:56.603
I'm sorry.

06:58.243 --> 07:00.524
- You still alive?
- For now.

07:01.283 --> 07:02.811
Congratulations.

07:04.083 --> 07:05.802
It was a bloodbath.

07:05.803 --> 07:07.004
I heard.

07:09.443 --> 07:10.883
Listen, Eric,

07:11.603 --> 07:13.805
if there was something I could have done,
I would have done it.

07:13.806 --> 07:14.882
- I know.
- All right?

07:14.883 --> 07:17.283
Yeah, I know. I know.

07:18.042 --> 07:19.166
Okay.

07:19.843 --> 07:20.890
Just tell me,

07:21.643 --> 07:22.723
who was it?

07:23.363 --> 07:25.491
- Come on, Eric.
- Come on, Will.

07:25.563 --> 07:27.211
- Rogers?
- I'm not going to say, you know.

07:27.283 --> 07:28.603
- You know me.
- Robertson?

07:32.483 --> 07:34.562
That cunt. I knew it.

07:34.563 --> 07:36.003
I knew I shouldn't have
fucking gone to her last year.

07:36.083 --> 07:37.925
It wasn't anyone.
Eric, you know what it was?

07:37.926 --> 07:39.243
It was bad luck, and that's all it was.

07:39.244 --> 07:40.290
Yup.

07:40.923 --> 07:41.883
Yup.

07:43.962 --> 07:45.523
All right, well, good luck.

07:45.602 --> 07:46.682
Will?

07:47.483 --> 07:48.771
Come here.

07:51.203 --> 07:53.003
I was just in the middle
of a lot of shit right here

07:53.083 --> 07:54.883
that I think somebody needs
to take a look at.

07:55.682 --> 07:57.123
Eric, listen,

07:58.323 --> 08:00.210
they're telling us
everybody needs to get out of here.

08:00.211 --> 08:02.282
Just leave their stuff.

08:02.283 --> 08:04.803
And while we appreciate your concern,

08:06.563 --> 08:08.886
this is not your problem anymore.

08:13.642 --> 08:14.646
Good luck.

08:19.522 --> 08:20.810
Thank you.

08:28.042 --> 08:30.083
Right this way, Mr. Murphy.

08:49.762 --> 08:51.890
- Eric, I'm very sorry.
- Yeah.

08:52.442 --> 08:55.049
Did they say what was going
to happen with us?

08:55.122 --> 08:57.163
- Jesus, Seth.
- What?

08:57.242 --> 08:59.680
It's going to get pretty ugly
around here for a while.

08:59.681 --> 09:02.409
But, you know, you guys will be all right.

09:03.361 --> 09:05.402
- Good luck, Eric.
- All right.

09:08.002 --> 09:11.406
I'll see you around, okay?
All right. Thank you.

09:31.361 --> 09:32.321
Eric.

09:35.081 --> 09:36.641
I wanted to say thanks.

09:37.482 --> 09:39.282
- It's not necessary.
- Well, it is.

09:39.962 --> 09:42.281
You were the person around here that I...

09:42.316 --> 09:43.569
I know.

09:47.001 --> 09:48.640
Hey, look,

09:48.641 --> 09:51.085
I was working on something,
but they wouldn't let me finish it.

09:51.161 --> 09:53.649
So, take a look at it.

09:55.361 --> 09:56.365
Be careful.

10:16.880 --> 10:17.928
<i>We're sorry.</i>

10:17.929 --> 10:21.849
<i>The telephone you are calling from
is not in service at this time.</i>

10:28.520 --> 10:29.644
Robertson!

10:29.721 --> 10:31.281
Sarah Robertson.

10:31.560 --> 10:32.727
Sarah.

10:34.121 --> 10:35.965
You shut off my phone?

10:36.480 --> 10:38.521
Eric, I didn't do anything.

10:38.801 --> 10:39.848
Fuck you.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.041
Well, that was fucking hideous.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.168
It's gonna get worse before it gets better.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.728
You think?

11:12.160 --> 11:13.207
Much.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.320
You got any Nicorettes?

11:17.440 --> 11:19.284
I'm out of Nicorettes.

11:20.760 --> 11:24.285
Which means in about 10 minutes
I'm going to kill someone.

11:29.279 --> 11:30.403
You all right, Sam?

11:31.560 --> 11:33.120
My dog is dying.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.488
I'm sorry.

11:39.200 --> 11:43.041
Just got off the phone with the vet.
Fucking tumor on her liver.

11:43.800 --> 11:48.088
I was spending, like, $1,000 a day
already just trying to keep her alive.

11:48.160 --> 11:49.240
Yeah,

11:49.840 --> 11:52.884
I don't have a fucking clue
what to do about it.

11:55.919 --> 11:57.883
Well, they're all gone.

11:59.919 --> 12:00.967
So...

12:04.519 --> 12:06.279
How many do we have left?

12:06.280 --> 12:07.524
About 33.

12:07.599 --> 12:11.408
Well, make sure they're all out there.
I've gotta say something.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.540
Yeah, no, they're ready.

12:13.575 --> 12:15.600
They're ready for you.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.280
All right, let's hear it.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.278
You're all still here for a reason.

12:38.279 --> 12:41.519
80% of this floor
was just sent home, forever.

12:42.439 --> 12:44.958
We spent the last hour
saying our goodbyes.

12:44.959 --> 12:47.878
They were good people
and they were good at their jobs,

12:47.879 --> 12:49.122
but you were better.

12:50.079 --> 12:53.118
Now they're gone,
they're not to be thought of again.

12:53.119 --> 12:55.563
This is your opportunity.

12:56.839 --> 12:58.277
On every floor of this building

12:58.278 --> 13:00.198
and in every office,
from Hong Kong to London,

13:00.279 --> 13:01.762
the same thing is happening.

13:01.839 --> 13:03.367
By the time we're done,

13:03.439 --> 13:07.880
three of every seven guys who were
standing between you and your boss' job

13:08.519 --> 13:09.839
are gone.

13:10.719 --> 13:13.446
That is your opportunity.

13:16.438 --> 13:19.123
I've been with this place for 34 years,

13:19.639 --> 13:22.557
and I can tell you this is not the last
time that you're gonna go through this.

13:22.558 --> 13:24.522
But you are all survivors.

13:25.279 --> 13:30.717
And that is how this firm, over 107 years,
has continued to grow stronger.

13:30.718 --> 13:34.200
So keep your heads high. Get back to work.
Let's hear it.

14:24.318 --> 14:26.598
Everyone's going out, man.
You should... Come on.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.605
No, man. I'm cool. Thanks.

14:30.398 --> 14:32.796
Okay. Well, if you change your mind,
just give me a call.

14:32.797 --> 14:34.958
I will.

14:35.038 --> 14:36.118
Come.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.478
- Where you guys going?
- The Grand.

14:41.277 --> 14:43.516
I will call you when I am done.

14:43.517 --> 14:44.838
All right.

14:45.397 --> 14:47.678
Hey, be glad you're still alive.

14:50.038 --> 14:51.118
I am.

15:01.037 --> 15:03.361
- Have a good night, man.
- You, too.

18:00.595 --> 18:01.916
Come on. Come on. Come on.

18:01.995 --> 18:03.043
<i>We're sorry.
You've reached a number...</i>

18:03.115 --> 18:05.439
<i>- Fuck me. Fuck!
- ...that has been disconnected.</i>

18:16.475 --> 18:17.958
- Hello?
- Hey.

18:19.595 --> 18:21.440
<i>- I can't hear you.
- What?</i>

18:21.915 --> 18:23.520
Can you go outside? It's too loud.

18:23.595 --> 18:26.879
Hold on a second. It's loud.
Just give me a second.

18:30.395 --> 18:31.835
<i>- All right, what's up?
- Hey, where are you?</i>

18:32.035 --> 18:34.643
<i>- Lugo.
- Okay. Are you with Will?</i>

18:34.714 --> 18:36.482
<i>- Yeah. Will Emerson?
- Yeah.</i>

18:36.555 --> 18:38.399
Yeah. I think he's still here. Why?

18:39.794 --> 18:43.199
All right. I need you to get Will,
and I need you guys to come back up here.

18:43.275 --> 18:44.955
<i>- Where?
- To the office.</i>

18:45.035 --> 18:46.595
<i>- What?
- I'm serious.</i>

18:47.754 --> 18:50.873
Wait a sec... You want me
to get our boss' boss out of a club

18:50.874 --> 18:53.198
and bring him back to the office
at 10:00 on a Thursday night?

18:53.514 --> 18:55.915
Well, our boss got axed,
so technically he is our boss,

18:55.994 --> 18:58.918
<i>- and yes, that is what I want you to do.
- Why?</i>

18:59.355 --> 19:01.843
Look, man. Just trust me, okay?
I need you guys back here now.

19:01.914 --> 19:04.118
<i>All right. We'll be there in 10.</i>

19:06.114 --> 19:07.194
Fuck.

19:23.034 --> 19:25.958
Have I ever told you
how much I love your bag?

19:26.034 --> 19:27.081
No, really.

19:27.154 --> 19:30.078
- Do you have a little dress that matches it?
- Yeah, I do.

19:30.154 --> 19:33.593
Because you could bounce around in it
like a fucking girl.

19:33.594 --> 19:34.641
Hey!

19:35.194 --> 19:37.758
Look who's burning the candle
at both ends.

19:37.834 --> 19:40.033
Why didn't you come out with us?

19:40.034 --> 19:43.353
There's no more cuts planned.
You don't have to kiss my arse.

19:43.354 --> 19:45.436
I frankly don't even know
what it is you guys do.

19:45.437 --> 19:47.518
Well, I'm really sorry
I had to bring you guys back here,

19:47.519 --> 19:49.358
- but...
- That's all right.

19:49.433 --> 19:51.757
- What's going on?
- Look at this.

19:51.834 --> 19:54.753
- Eric gave me this file before he left.
- Eric...

19:54.754 --> 19:57.122
Dale. And he told me
that he couldn't quite figure it out.

19:57.123 --> 19:58.958
And the last thing he said to me

19:59.033 --> 20:01.478
before the elevator doors closed was,
"Be careful".

20:02.394 --> 20:04.792
- He said, "Be careful"?
- Yeah. So, obviously, I'm a little curious.

20:04.793 --> 20:05.960
I start to get into it a little bit,

20:06.033 --> 20:08.237
and I realize that the only thing
that he's missing...

20:08.314 --> 20:11.402
- This is not good, Will.
- All right. Okay. So what is he doing here?

20:12.434 --> 20:14.562
No, no. Go to model four.
It makes more sense.

20:14.634 --> 20:16.312
Okay. All right.

20:16.313 --> 20:17.754
What is this?

20:18.273 --> 20:21.481
This is basically everything that
we have in our books at any given time.

20:21.553 --> 20:24.041
But, what Eric was trying to do
was to work these numbers

20:24.114 --> 20:27.354
for levels of volatility that fall
outside of the standard VAR model.

20:27.433 --> 20:29.912
- What are those levels?
- It's fairly complicated.

20:29.913 --> 20:30.993
Simplify.

20:31.514 --> 20:34.918
The volatility levels are set
using historic patterns, basically,

20:34.993 --> 20:37.315
and then stretching those patterns
out another 10, 15% roughly.

20:37.316 --> 20:38.273
All right, so?

20:38.353 --> 20:41.922
So, we are starting
to test those historic patterns.

20:43.073 --> 20:44.120
When?

20:44.513 --> 20:46.072
- Today.
- Tuesday.

20:46.073 --> 20:49.041
Monday. Last Friday and Wednesday.

20:49.113 --> 20:50.880
Two Fridays ago.

20:51.153 --> 20:52.833
All right. I get it.

20:54.873 --> 20:56.152
Fuck me.

20:56.153 --> 20:59.192
Once this thing gets going
in the wrong direction,

20:59.193 --> 21:00.672
this is fucking huge.

21:00.673 --> 21:01.994
How huge?

21:03.513 --> 21:05.641
Well, the losses are greater than
the current value of the company.

21:05.713 --> 21:08.277
Projected losses.
The projected losses, Will.

21:08.832 --> 21:11.200
- And this is just our floor?
- Yes.

21:13.833 --> 21:14.880
Where the fuck is Eric Dale?

21:14.953 --> 21:16.513
I don't know. I tried to call him.
His phone is off.

21:16.593 --> 21:17.595
What do you mean?

21:17.596 --> 21:19.874
They turned everybody's phone off
that they axed today.

21:19.875 --> 21:21.193
Fucking ruthless.

21:21.872 --> 21:25.157
- Did you try his personal cell?
- Yeah, I called his cell phone. it's not on.

21:25.233 --> 21:27.556
- Call his home.
- At this hour?

21:27.632 --> 21:29.836
Yeah. Do we even know if he's right?

21:29.913 --> 21:32.761
- Looks pretty fucking right to me.
- It does.

21:35.513 --> 21:37.631
Mrs. Dale, it's Will Emerson.

21:37.632 --> 21:40.436
I'm fine, thank you. May I speak with Eric?

21:42.793 --> 21:44.953
No, we've tried that.
His phone appears to be off.

21:44.954 --> 21:48.717
Listen, could you have him call me
the moment he comes in?

21:48.792 --> 21:51.193
The moment he walks through the door.

21:51.272 --> 21:52.991
Thank you so much.

21:52.992 --> 21:54.312
Goodbye.

21:54.392 --> 21:55.396
Where the fuck is he?

21:55.472 --> 21:57.120
- Doesn't he have, like, three kids?
- So?

21:57.155 --> 21:59.676
Fuck, I don't know, would you go home?

22:01.312 --> 22:02.993
I know where he is.

22:04.112 --> 22:05.595
I need you two to go and get him.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.516
There will be a car
waiting for you downstairs.

22:07.592 --> 22:09.272
- You need to go.
- Right now?

22:09.352 --> 22:10.956
Yeah, right now.

22:11.032 --> 22:12.320
What are you going to do?

22:12.321 --> 22:14.113
I'm going to call Sam.

22:18.112 --> 22:19.432
Fuck me.

22:35.111 --> 22:36.836
<i>- Yes?
- It's Will.</i>

22:37.592 --> 22:39.476
It's 11:00 at night.

22:39.511 --> 22:41.431
I know. I'm sorry. I wouldn't have called.

22:42.352 --> 22:43.880
What's the problem?

22:44.632 --> 22:46.399
I think you need to get back here.

22:47.031 --> 22:48.232
What?

22:48.831 --> 22:50.239
<i>Sam, listen...</i>

22:50.312 --> 22:51.990
it's 11:00 at night.

22:51.991 --> 22:56.159
I'm well aware of the fucking time, Sam.
I'm telling you, you need to see this.

22:56.231 --> 22:57.311
<i>See what?</i>

22:57.672 --> 22:58.676
It's...

22:59.271 --> 23:00.679
E- mail it to me.

23:01.112 --> 23:04.080
I don't think that, that
would be a good idea.

23:06.951 --> 23:08.512
I'm on my way.

23:14.032 --> 23:15.636
Look at these people.

23:17.592 --> 23:21.716
Wandering around with absolutely no idea
what's about to happen.

23:25.111 --> 23:26.116
Right?

23:26.951 --> 23:29.919
Well, I try to not let
work get to me like that.

23:30.632 --> 23:32.672
I've noticed that about you.

23:34.192 --> 23:36.515
Come on. We're 23 years old.

23:37.471 --> 23:39.230
- I'm 28.
- All right, 28.

23:39.231 --> 23:40.475
Whatever, it's the same thing,

23:40.551 --> 23:45.352
but I made nearly a quarter
of a million dollars last year.

23:46.631 --> 23:47.678
Fuck. For what?

23:48.311 --> 23:50.559
I push numbers around
on a computer screen.

23:50.911 --> 23:53.519
A bunch of glorified crack addicts
are willing to take that information,

23:53.591 --> 23:54.551
and they pretend to understand it,

23:54.631 --> 23:56.670
and they bet it against some other jock
halfway around the world

23:56.671 --> 23:57.992
who, you know, if he wasn't doing this,

23:58.070 --> 24:01.278
he'd be in an OTB somewhere,
putting it all on number seven, you know?

24:02.271 --> 24:05.392
At the end of the day,
one guy wins, one guy loses.

24:06.831 --> 24:09.832
You do know it's a little more
complicated than that, right?

24:10.231 --> 24:11.311
Yeah.

24:17.950 --> 24:20.510
It's Will. He wants to know if we found him.
What do I say?

24:20.511 --> 24:22.998
Let's say that we haven't found him yet.

24:23.710 --> 24:24.757
Okay.

24:47.190 --> 24:48.510
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:48.511 --> 24:49.590
So?

24:50.870 --> 24:51.874
Eric Dale.

24:51.951 --> 24:53.239
Oh, Jesus.

24:54.070 --> 24:56.558
Before he leaves the building,
escorted by fucking security, by the way...

24:56.630 --> 24:58.070
- I had nothing to do with that.
- I know.

24:58.150 --> 24:59.230
I'm sorry. Go on.

24:59.310 --> 25:01.918
Before he leaves the building,
he hands this disk to Peter Sullivan.

25:01.990 --> 25:03.396
- Who's Peter Sullivan again?
- Doesn't matter.

25:03.397 --> 25:04.994
- He's one of Eric's guys.
- All right.

25:04.995 --> 25:10.555
But before the elevator doors are closing,
the last thing that he says is, "Be careful".

25:11.709 --> 25:13.314
"Be careful"?

25:13.390 --> 25:14.394
Yeah.

25:14.470 --> 25:15.517
- "Be careful"?
- Yeah.

25:15.590 --> 25:17.270
- Why?
- Take a look.

25:20.190 --> 25:22.231
Oh, Jesus. You Know
I can't fucking read these things.

25:22.232 --> 25:23.670
Just speak to me in English.

25:23.671 --> 25:27.674
All right. Basically, this Kid, Peter Sullivan,
he gets all inspired by your pep talk.

25:27.750 --> 25:29.469
Nice job, by the way.

25:29.470 --> 25:32.148
And he delves straight in after work.

25:32.149 --> 25:33.350
And I think he nailed it.

25:33.789 --> 25:34.913
Nailed it?

25:34.990 --> 25:38.109
Yeah, I think he figured out
what Eric was missing.

25:38.110 --> 25:39.517
And?

25:39.589 --> 25:41.357
It's not good, Sam.

25:41.909 --> 25:45.598
These here are
the historical volatility index limits

25:45.670 --> 25:49.109
which, of course, our entire trading model
relies on pretty fucking heavily.

25:49.110 --> 25:53.234
Well, we're now so levered up
that once it gets outside of these limits,

25:55.109 --> 25:56.550
it gets ugly in a hurry.

25:56.909 --> 25:59.397
And how close to those limits
have we gotten?

25:59.469 --> 26:01.597
Sam, we're beyond close.

26:02.069 --> 26:05.429
We broke through these limits
five or six days in the last two weeks.

26:05.590 --> 26:08.317
Now, somehow we've managed to
stay on the right side of it for now.

26:08.389 --> 26:09.590
For now.

26:09.990 --> 26:13.394
Well, look what happens
when we get on the wrong side of it.

26:18.989 --> 26:21.838
- Wait a minute. What am I looking at?
- You're looking at this figure here.

26:25.189 --> 26:26.630
- Whoa. Is that...
- Yeah.

26:26.709 --> 26:29.950
And that would not be a bad day for us,
historically speaking.

26:30.309 --> 26:32.349
- Is that figure right?
- I don't know. I can't be sure.

26:32.749 --> 26:33.797
Where's Eric Dale?

26:33.869 --> 26:35.396
- We shut his phone off.
- Of course we did.

26:35.397 --> 26:37.909
Yeah. So I called his wife,
who says he's not home.

26:37.989 --> 26:39.593
Yeah, he's probably crying
in some fucking beer somewhere.

26:39.669 --> 26:41.109
Yeah, or worse.

26:41.189 --> 26:42.313
Where's the kid that did this?

26:42.469 --> 26:43.910
I sent him out looking for Eric.

26:43.989 --> 26:45.594
You think he knows what he's doing?

26:46.748 --> 26:47.828
I don't know. What do I know?

26:47.909 --> 26:49.753
Get him back here. Get him back here.

27:01.509 --> 27:04.390
What do you think these girls
make in a night?

27:04.709 --> 27:05.910
$1,500?

27:12.828 --> 27:14.269
Two grand?

27:15.828 --> 27:17.236
Two grand.

27:18.068 --> 27:21.909
Fuck. That's... That's pretty great.

27:22.628 --> 27:24.473
I mean, all considered.

27:29.268 --> 27:30.387
Shit.

27:30.388 --> 27:31.512
Will.

27:33.428 --> 27:34.552
Yep.

27:35.348 --> 27:37.913
No. No, we asked, and nobody's seen him.

27:40.788 --> 27:42.392
Okay, yep.

27:55.388 --> 27:58.716
All right, so what do you think
Rogers makes in a year?

27:59.948 --> 28:02.076
- I don't know, I have no idea.
- Come on. Play along.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.593
- What year? I don't know.
- Last year.

28:05.067 --> 28:07.108
Three quarters of a million.

28:08.988 --> 28:10.232
Come on.

28:10.788 --> 28:12.947
- What?
- Oh, it's not even close.

28:12.948 --> 28:14.715
- More?
- Much more.

28:15.668 --> 28:17.108
A million?

28:17.188 --> 28:19.588
Will Emerson made
two and a half million last year.

28:19.668 --> 28:21.467
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me.

28:21.468 --> 28:23.672
Fuck you. How do you know that?

28:24.827 --> 28:26.388
- He told me.
- He just told you?

28:26.467 --> 28:29.348
I asked him, and yeah, he told me.

28:29.428 --> 28:31.272
You think that's true?

28:31.748 --> 28:33.352
Yeah, probably.

28:33.428 --> 28:35.195
That's fucked up.

28:35.267 --> 28:39.076
- Why is that fucked up?
- I don't know, does it seem right to you?

28:39.428 --> 28:41.948
Right? I mean, right is... Right is...

28:44.067 --> 28:45.234
Jesus.

28:46.507 --> 28:48.035
So what do you think
that means Rogers puts away?

28:48.036 --> 28:51.508
I have no idea, Seth.
This traffic is a fucking nightmare.

29:06.667 --> 29:07.834
Sorry.

29:14.347 --> 29:15.351
Gentlemen.

29:16.227 --> 29:18.266
Will. Mr. Rogers.

29:18.267 --> 29:20.035
Come with us, please.

29:26.227 --> 29:28.305
Sam, this is Seth Bregman
and Peter Sullivan.

29:28.306 --> 29:29.430
Sir.

29:32.307 --> 29:33.474
Will?

29:34.667 --> 29:36.111
Where are we going?

29:36.146 --> 29:39.551
We're going to get a second opinion
on your work, Peter.

30:14.507 --> 30:16.547
So, Sam, what do you have for us?

30:16.626 --> 30:17.630
It'll be here in a minute.

30:17.706 --> 30:20.508
Finding somebody in the copy room at this
hour was a little bit of a challenge.

30:20.509 --> 30:22.067
Okay, let's go right
into the introductions.

30:22.146 --> 30:23.510
This is Sarah Robertson, who you know.

30:23.586 --> 30:26.905
Chief Risk Management Officer
Ramesh Shah from upstairs.

30:26.906 --> 30:29.230
And David Horn,
one of the firm's in-house counsel.

30:29.506 --> 30:32.985
Nice to meet you all. This is my Head
of Trading, Will Emerson, and this is...

30:32.986 --> 30:36.391
Peter Sullivan and Seth Bregman.
They work in our Risk Department.

30:36.466 --> 30:37.906
Where's Eric Dale?

30:38.266 --> 30:39.990
He was let go today.

30:42.226 --> 30:44.985
Who do you have left
in your Risk Department?

30:44.986 --> 30:48.794
As of today that would be
Peter and our Junior Analyst, Seth.

30:51.145 --> 30:52.313
Really?

30:53.386 --> 30:54.586
Will Emerson?

30:54.666 --> 30:56.914
Yes, please. Just hand them out.

30:57.386 --> 30:58.390
Thank you.

31:09.545 --> 31:11.672
Apparently, Eric had been working on this
for some time,

31:11.707 --> 31:12.954
but he wasn't able to finish it.

31:13.026 --> 31:14.586
This morning, as he left the building,

31:14.587 --> 31:17.313
he handed the program to Peter here
and asked him to take a look at it.

31:17.385 --> 31:21.030
Peter did. He put a few things in
that Eric seemed to be missing,

31:21.106 --> 31:23.025
and this is what came out.

31:24.826 --> 31:26.069
Peter, is this your work?

31:28.146 --> 31:29.434
Mostly Mr. Dale's.

31:30.025 --> 31:31.825
But is this your draft?

31:31.826 --> 31:32.905
Yes.

31:33.945 --> 31:37.273
Again, expanded on the original work
by Mr. Dale. But, yes.

31:37.585 --> 31:38.709
What's your background?

31:38.785 --> 31:40.193
- My background?
- Your CV?

31:40.265 --> 31:41.584
I've been with the firm
for two and a half years,

31:41.585 --> 31:42.633
working with Eric that whole time.

31:42.705 --> 31:44.549
But I hold a doctorate in engineering,

31:44.625 --> 31:47.544
specialty in propulsion, from MIT
with a bachelor's from Penn.

31:47.545 --> 31:49.913
What is a specialty in propulsion, exactly?

31:50.145 --> 31:52.829
My thesis was a study
in the ways that friction ratios

31:52.905 --> 31:55.666
affect steering outcomes in aeronautical
use under reduced gravity loads.

31:57.025 --> 31:59.153
So, you're a rocket scientist?

31:59.505 --> 32:00.946
I was. Yeah.

32:01.985 --> 32:03.109
Interesting.

32:03.345 --> 32:04.633
How did you end up here?

32:04.705 --> 32:07.432
It's all just numbers, really.
Just changing what you're adding up.

32:07.505 --> 32:10.987
And to speak freely, the money here is
considerably more attractive.

32:19.744 --> 32:21.144
What time is it?

32:21.145 --> 32:22.192
2215.

32:22.624 --> 32:25.548
Fuck me. Fuck me.

32:26.025 --> 32:28.393
And I'm guessing by the fact
that you two haven't said anything

32:28.465 --> 32:30.104
that the math checks out.

32:30.105 --> 32:33.270
Look, we'd need some time to go over this.

32:33.344 --> 32:36.629
But Mr. Sullivan here seems like
he knows what he's doing.

32:36.705 --> 32:38.385
So, it would appear we have a problem.

32:38.585 --> 32:39.984
Thank you for that.

32:39.985 --> 32:41.263
What time is it?

32:41.264 --> 32:42.869
- 2:16.
- Fuck me.

32:44.464 --> 32:45.665
Fuck me.

32:53.624 --> 32:56.663
Sam, how long under normal operations

32:56.664 --> 32:58.945
would it take your people
to clear that from our books?

33:02.384 --> 33:03.704
What?

33:04.425 --> 33:06.105
- All of it?
- Yes.

33:07.744 --> 33:09.143
I don't know. Weeks.

33:09.144 --> 33:10.911
- Weeks?
- Yeah. Weeks.

33:11.824 --> 33:15.393
But you certainly know
that our business is selling and buying?

33:16.584 --> 33:18.428
It doesn't work for very long
without both components.

33:18.504 --> 33:20.064
We suddenly stop buying for a day or two,

33:20.144 --> 33:23.183
that's not something you can hide
under the rug. That gets out.

33:23.184 --> 33:27.385
And when it does, this whole thing
comes to an end, and right quick.

33:28.504 --> 33:30.424
- I understand.
- Do you?

33:33.504 --> 33:34.508
Yes.

33:36.704 --> 33:40.031
How many traders do we have left
between your floor and Peterson's?

33:40.103 --> 33:41.991
- I don't know, what...
- 60.

33:42.064 --> 33:43.545
Jared, as I look at this more closely,

33:43.546 --> 33:45.824
it is these VAR numbers
that are setting this thing off.

33:45.904 --> 33:47.192
Excuse me.

33:58.864 --> 34:00.662
I warned you about this last year.

34:00.663 --> 34:02.747
We would not be in this position
if we had done what I...

34:02.748 --> 34:03.703
Please.

34:03.784 --> 34:06.263
As I was saying,
and I speak completely off the record,

34:06.264 --> 34:08.063
it's only a matter of time
before someone else

34:08.143 --> 34:11.068
starts putting these in and
they come up with exactly the same results

34:11.143 --> 34:12.824
and look at exactly
what we're looking at right now,

34:12.902 --> 34:13.949
if they haven't already.

34:13.951 --> 34:15.342
Understood.

34:15.342 --> 34:18.703
And, Sarah, what value would you allow
to be placed on those assets

34:18.783 --> 34:21.101
that might remain on the books,
if they had to?

34:21.103 --> 34:22.748
Why would they still be on the books?

34:22.750 --> 34:24.389
Because suddenly nobody wants
to fucking buy them.

34:24.463 --> 34:25.748
Fuck you, Sam. Will you give me

34:25.750 --> 34:26.944
- a fucking break here?
- Excuse me, Jared...

34:27.023 --> 34:28.943
Without an active market,
it would take weeks or months

34:29.023 --> 34:30.943
for me to come up with
an accurate value on them.

34:31.023 --> 34:32.387
You would have to go block by block.

34:32.464 --> 34:34.864
Look, Jared, it's a very simple business,
right? We talked about this.

34:34.944 --> 34:36.110
Sam.

34:36.983 --> 34:39.187
Will, Peter, and...

34:39.263 --> 34:40.507
- What the fuck is his name?
- Seth.

34:40.507 --> 34:43.908
Thank you. Seth. Could you please
give us a few moments?

34:45.822 --> 34:47.143
And, Peter?

34:47.583 --> 34:48.826
Has anyone else seen this?

34:49.143 --> 34:50.703
No, no one aside from us.

34:50.783 --> 34:52.387
- And Eric Dale.
- Yes.

34:52.463 --> 34:56.462
And can it really be possible that
we don't know where Eric Dale is?

34:56.463 --> 34:58.591
I called his wife, he hasn't come home yet,

34:58.663 --> 35:01.141
and we turned off his phone today.

35:01.142 --> 35:02.190
Perfect.

35:02.783 --> 35:04.388
Well, I'd like to know where he is.

35:14.342 --> 35:17.302
Jesus fucking Christ. Who is that guy?

35:17.303 --> 35:18.624
Sam's boss.

35:19.623 --> 35:21.784
He looks like he's 15 years old.

35:21.862 --> 35:23.270
He's 40.

35:23.343 --> 35:25.351
Yeah, how does that happen?

35:25.862 --> 35:27.903
Oh, it happens all the time.

35:30.782 --> 35:32.266
Except to me.

35:34.342 --> 35:36.229
Kid's a fucking killer.

35:38.622 --> 35:41.187
What are they talking about in there?

35:45.423 --> 35:47.027
It ain't pretty.

35:48.142 --> 35:49.790
What ain't pretty?

35:51.022 --> 35:53.750
If people stop buying what we're selling.

35:57.742 --> 35:58.909
Jared.

36:00.182 --> 36:02.910
You cannot be doing
what you're thinking of doing.

36:02.982 --> 36:04.466
Well, I don't see any other choice.

36:04.542 --> 36:05.950
What does that mean,
we don't have a choice?

36:06.022 --> 36:07.101
Fuck you, you don't have a choice.

36:07.182 --> 36:10.381
Fuck me?
Did you even look at the numbers, Sam?

36:10.382 --> 36:11.861
Yeah, but what do I know?

36:11.862 --> 36:13.270
Correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Shah,

36:13.342 --> 36:15.661
but these numbers, they don't add up.

36:15.662 --> 36:17.102
One and one no longer makes two.

36:17.182 --> 36:18.860
Look, if I may,
I would like a little bit more time.

36:18.861 --> 36:20.181
Jared, we can't tell you yet.

36:20.182 --> 36:22.428
Are you fucking kidding me?
We have talked about this.

36:22.429 --> 36:24.790
We need a little more time
to give you our conclusion.

36:24.791 --> 36:27.347
Okay. We meet again in 45 minutes.

36:27.821 --> 36:30.189
- Sam, do you have the file?
- Yeah.

36:46.741 --> 36:48.705
What are you going to do?

36:51.342 --> 36:53.186
Are you gonna call him?

36:57.702 --> 36:59.185
I already have.

37:13.421 --> 37:14.545
Jesus.

37:18.861 --> 37:20.585
Wow, that's gorgeous.

37:29.501 --> 37:31.226
It's a long way down.

37:32.061 --> 37:33.382
Yes, it is.

37:44.620 --> 37:46.748
Will, don't do that. Come on.

37:49.741 --> 37:51.508
You know the feeling that people experience

37:51.509 --> 37:55.385
when they stand on the edge like this
isn't a fear of falling.

37:55.460 --> 37:57.861
It's the fear that they might jump.

37:58.541 --> 38:01.422
That's very deep and depressing.
Thank you.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.660
Yeah, well, I'm a little dark sometimes.

38:03.661 --> 38:05.985
All right. Come down, please, Will.
Please, come on.

38:06.060 --> 38:07.304
Will.

38:07.581 --> 38:09.021
Yeah, fuck it.

38:11.940 --> 38:13.261
Not today!

38:19.981 --> 38:22.305
It looks like they're going to
make us dump this shit.

38:22.500 --> 38:23.547
What?

38:24.341 --> 38:25.740
You watch.

38:25.741 --> 38:26.865
How?

38:27.501 --> 38:28.659
You'll see.

38:28.660 --> 38:30.099
How could they do that?

38:30.100 --> 38:32.828
They can't. It's impossible.
But they'll figure a way.

38:33.100 --> 38:34.748
I've been at this company for 10 years,

38:34.749 --> 38:37.948
and I've seen things you wouldn't believe.

38:38.660 --> 38:41.267
When all is said and done,
they do not lose money.

38:41.340 --> 38:43.980
They don't mind if everybody else does,

38:44.060 --> 38:45.828
but they don't lose.

38:53.780 --> 38:54.860
Will?

38:56.100 --> 38:59.179
Did you really make
two and a half million last year?

38:59.180 --> 39:00.501
Yeah, sure.

39:03.660 --> 39:05.580
How did you spend it all?

39:06.020 --> 39:07.384
It goes quite quickly.

39:07.459 --> 39:09.302
You know,
you learn to spend what's in your pocket.

39:09.303 --> 39:10.860
Two and a half million goes quickly?

39:10.940 --> 39:12.784
All right, let's see.

39:12.860 --> 39:14.899
So the taxman takes half up front,

39:14.900 --> 39:16.263
so you're left with one and a quarter.

39:17.100 --> 39:19.378
My mortgage takes another 300 grand.

39:19.379 --> 39:22.587
I send 150 home for my parents,
you know, keep them going.

39:22.660 --> 39:23.859
- So what's that?
- 800.

39:23.860 --> 39:25.104
All right, 800.

39:25.940 --> 39:27.664
Spent 150 on a car.

39:28.380 --> 39:32.308
About 75 on restaurants.
Probably 50 on clothes.

39:33.419 --> 39:36.339
- I put 400 away for a rainy day.
- That's smart.

39:36.340 --> 39:39.821
Yeah, as it turns out,
'cause it looks like the storm's coming.

39:40.499 --> 39:42.027
You still got 125.

39:43.939 --> 39:48.380
Yeah, well, I did spend $76,520
on hookers, booze, and dancers.

39:48.459 --> 39:50.107
But mainly hookers.

39:51.259 --> 39:52.460
76,5007

39:53.259 --> 39:55.387
I was a little shocked initially,
but then I realized

39:55.459 --> 39:58.699
that I could claim most of it back
as entertainment. it's true.

40:03.940 --> 40:05.107
- Holy shit!
- Goddamn!

40:05.180 --> 40:07.907
The cavalry is here!
Come on, we should go.

40:14.499 --> 40:16.060
How old are you?

40:17.619 --> 40:19.224
- 43.
- Jesus.

40:24.819 --> 40:26.423
This is bizarre.

40:28.778 --> 40:30.787
It's like a dream.

40:34.619 --> 40:38.667
I don't know, seems like we actually
may have just woken up.

40:41.258 --> 40:42.338
Come in.

40:43.659 --> 40:45.142
How do we look?

40:45.818 --> 40:48.306
- I should go.
- No. You should stay.

40:48.379 --> 40:49.503
So?

40:50.139 --> 40:51.857
It's legit.

40:51.858 --> 40:53.463
The kid killed it.

40:54.139 --> 40:56.300
The formula's worthless.

40:56.378 --> 40:58.223
- What does that mean?
- It's broken.

40:59.179 --> 41:02.103
There are eight trillion dollars of paper
around the world

41:02.179 --> 41:03.706
relying on that equation.

41:03.778 --> 41:05.022
Well, we were wrong.

41:05.099 --> 41:07.303
No, you mean you were wrong.

41:07.378 --> 41:09.419
Now, don't get me started.
We discussed this.

41:09.499 --> 41:10.546
I'm heading for the conference room.

41:10.618 --> 41:12.058
No, I want you to hear this.

41:13.978 --> 41:15.857
I don't want to hear this.

41:15.858 --> 41:19.186
How do you think I've stuck around
this place so long?

41:26.378 --> 41:27.818
I called Tuld.

41:30.298 --> 41:32.186
Do we have a contingency plan here?

41:32.187 --> 41:34.382
- A contingency plan?
- Yes.

41:34.738 --> 41:36.986
No, we went all in on this one.

41:38.058 --> 41:41.505
So we've gotten ourselves
quite exposed here, haven't we?

41:43.498 --> 41:45.507
To Tuld or the market?

41:47.338 --> 41:48.626
To both.

42:10.498 --> 42:11.981
He's here?

42:41.457 --> 42:44.456
- Tuld's helicopter just landed.
- I know. Come with us.

42:44.457 --> 42:46.541
- Where's Sam?
- I don't know. You sure you want all of us?

42:46.617 --> 42:47.784
Yes.

42:53.777 --> 42:57.137
One piece of advice for everyone
before we go in there.

42:57.657 --> 42:59.185
This could get a little ugly.

42:59.257 --> 43:01.657
But whatever you do, just tell the truth.
No sugarcoating

43:01.737 --> 43:03.176
Do not change a word of it.

43:03.177 --> 43:06.779
No one here is smart enough,
including the rocket scientist.

43:13.417 --> 43:15.501
- Mr. Cohen.
- Morning.

43:17.297 --> 43:18.857
This way, please.

43:23.537 --> 43:25.740
He's already in there waiting for you.

43:25.817 --> 43:27.018
Excellent.

43:49.576 --> 43:50.656
John.

43:51.977 --> 43:53.581
Please, sit down.

43:56.296 --> 43:57.944
Welcome, everyone.

43:58.017 --> 44:00.624
I must apologize for dragging you all here
at such an uncommon hour.

44:00.696 --> 44:04.864
But from what I've been told, this
matter needs to be dealt with urgently.

44:04.936 --> 44:07.860
So urgently, in fact, it probably
should have been addressed weeks ago.

44:07.936 --> 44:10.097
But that is spilt milk under the bridge.

44:10.176 --> 44:14.181
So, why doesn't somebody tell me
what they think is going on here?

44:15.136 --> 44:17.744
Mr. Tuld, as I mentioned earlier,

44:17.816 --> 44:20.500
if you compare the figure
at the top of page 13...

44:20.576 --> 44:23.980
Jared, it's a little early for all that.
Just speak to me in plain English.

44:25.216 --> 44:26.255
Okay.

44:26.256 --> 44:28.297
In fact, I'd like to speak to
the guy who put this together.

44:28.376 --> 44:30.699
Mr. Sullivan, is it? Does he speak English?

44:30.776 --> 44:32.020
Sir?

44:32.096 --> 44:33.656
I'd like to speak with the analyst

44:33.736 --> 44:35.263
who seems to have
stumbled across this mess.

44:35.336 --> 44:38.260
Certainly. That would be Peter Sullivan.
Right here.

44:38.336 --> 44:40.497
Oh, Mr. Sullivan, you're here.
Good morning.

44:40.575 --> 44:43.215
Maybe you could tell me
what you think is going on here.

44:43.216 --> 44:47.100
And please,
speak as you might to a young child

44:47.175 --> 44:49.575
or a golden retriever.

44:49.576 --> 44:53.177
It wasn't brains that got me here.
I can assure you of that.

44:57.175 --> 45:00.176
Well, sir, as you may or may not know,
I work

45:00.256 --> 45:03.660
here for Mr. Rogers as an associate
in the Risk Assessment

45:03.736 --> 45:05.574
and Management Office at MBS.

45:05.575 --> 45:09.177
Please. Just relax. Stand up.
Tell us in a clear voice.

45:09.255 --> 45:11.536
What is the nature of the problem?

45:13.576 --> 45:14.623
Okay.

45:16.295 --> 45:19.654
As you probably know,
over the last 36 to 40 months

45:19.655 --> 45:22.743
the firm has begun packaging

45:22.815 --> 45:27.736
new MBS products that
combine several different tranches

45:27.815 --> 45:30.936
of rating classifications
in one tradable security.

45:31.815 --> 45:33.895
This has been enormously profitable,

45:33.896 --> 45:36.024
as I imagine you noticed.

45:36.096 --> 45:37.263
I have.

45:37.455 --> 45:39.584
The firm is currently doing
a considerable amount

45:39.655 --> 45:40.660
of this business every day.

45:40.735 --> 45:44.494
Now the problem, which is, I guess,
why we are here tonight,

45:44.495 --> 45:47.496
is that is takes us, the
firm, about a month

45:48.015 --> 45:52.174
to layer these products correctly,
thereby posing a challenge

45:52.175 --> 45:54.378
from a Risk Management standpoint.

45:54.615 --> 45:56.383
And, Mr. Sullivan, that challenge is?

45:56.775 --> 46:00.814
We have to hold these assets on our books
longer than we might ideally like to.

46:00.815 --> 46:01.982
Yes.

46:02.055 --> 46:04.782
But the key factor here is
these are essentially just mortgages.

46:04.855 --> 46:08.613
So that has allowed us to push
the leverage considerably beyond

46:08.614 --> 46:12.139
what you might be willing or allowed to do
in any other circumstance,

46:12.215 --> 46:16.023
thereby pushing the risk profile
without raising any red flags.

46:17.694 --> 46:19.419
Now... Thank you, Mr. Sullivan. Sit down.

46:19.495 --> 46:21.818
What I'm guessing your report here says,

46:21.895 --> 46:24.219
and give me some rope here.

46:24.294 --> 46:28.135
What I'm guessing it says is that
considering the, shall we say,

46:28.215 --> 46:31.259
bumpy road we've been on
the last week or so,

46:31.335 --> 46:35.974
that the figures your brilliant co-workers
up the line ahead of you have come up with

46:36.009 --> 46:38.253
don't make much sense any more

46:38.254 --> 46:40.655
considering what's taking place today.

46:40.734 --> 46:42.414
Actually, not what's taking place today,

46:42.415 --> 46:45.142
but what's already taken place
over the last two weeks.

46:45.215 --> 46:48.455
So, you're saying
this has already happened?

46:48.534 --> 46:49.854
Sort of.

46:51.255 --> 46:52.455
Sort of.

46:53.614 --> 46:58.142
And, Mr. Sullivan, what does your model
say that, that means for us here.

46:59.294 --> 47:01.782
Well, that's where it becomes a projection.

47:02.014 --> 47:03.181
But...

47:05.414 --> 47:07.978
You're speaking with me, Mr. Sullivan.

47:08.374 --> 47:09.738
Well, sir,

47:10.374 --> 47:14.093
if those assets decrease by just 25%

47:14.094 --> 47:15.981
and remain on our books,

47:16.574 --> 47:20.622
that loss would be greater than
the current market capitalization

47:20.694 --> 47:22.538
of this entire company.

47:25.894 --> 47:28.742
So, what you're telling me

47:30.254 --> 47:33.374
is that the music is about to stop

47:34.613 --> 47:37.657
and we're going to be left
holding the biggest bag

47:37.734 --> 47:39.022
of odorous excrement

47:39.293 --> 47:41.901
ever assembled in the history of

47:43.693 --> 47:45.057
capitalism.

47:48.934 --> 47:53.014
Sir, I'm not sure that I would put
it that way. But let me clarify.

47:53.533 --> 47:55.653
Using your analogy,

47:55.654 --> 47:57.454
what this model shows

47:58.493 --> 48:01.221
is the music, so to speak, just slowing.

48:02.534 --> 48:04.812
If the music were to stop, as you put it,

48:04.813 --> 48:07.978
then this model wouldn't be even close
to that scenario.

48:08.054 --> 48:10.661
It would be considerably worse.

48:14.533 --> 48:17.141
Let me tell you something, Mr. Sullivan.

48:18.133 --> 48:22.542
Do you care to know why
I'm in this chair with you all?

48:22.613 --> 48:24.937
I mean, why I earn the big bucks?

48:26.213 --> 48:27.173
Yes.

48:27.254 --> 48:30.374
I'm here for one reason
and one reason alone.

48:30.853 --> 48:36.701
I'm here to guess what the music might do
a week, a month, a year from now.

48:37.973 --> 48:39.261
That's it.

48:40.093 --> 48:41.217
Nothing more.

48:43.493 --> 48:45.577
And standing here tonight,

48:46.373 --> 48:51.741
I'm afraid that I don't hear a thing.

48:54.333 --> 48:55.500
Just

48:57.852 --> 48:59.336
silence.

49:14.492 --> 49:18.497
So, now that we Know the music has
stopped, what can we do about it?

49:19.252 --> 49:21.413
Mr. Cohen? Ms. Robertson?

49:22.773 --> 49:26.254
I'm afraid I think this is where
you're supposed to step back in.

49:26.692 --> 49:30.053
Lord knows we've relied enough
on Mr. Sullivan tonight.

49:31.652 --> 49:33.661
What do you have for us?

49:41.293 --> 49:45.297
What have I told you since
the first day you stepped into my office?

49:46.172 --> 49:48.976
There are three ways to make a living
in this business,

49:49.052 --> 49:52.293
be first, be smarter, or cheat.

49:53.172 --> 49:54.852
Now, I don't cheat.

49:55.332 --> 49:59.576
And although I like to think we have
some pretty smart people in this building,

50:00.172 --> 50:03.577
it sure is a hell of a lot
easier to just be first.

50:04.332 --> 50:06.057
Sell it all. Today.

50:08.772 --> 50:10.780
Is that even possible, Sam?

50:11.252 --> 50:13.096
Yes, but at what cost?

50:14.812 --> 50:16.372
I'll have to pay.

50:18.052 --> 50:19.491
Really?

50:19.492 --> 50:20.855
I think so.

50:22.012 --> 50:24.260
Where is this going to come back to us?

50:25.012 --> 50:26.059
Everywhere.

50:26.851 --> 50:31.260
Sam, I don't think you seem to understand
what your boy here has just said.

50:34.851 --> 50:36.456
If I made you,

50:37.212 --> 50:38.859
how would you do this?

50:44.492 --> 50:47.580
You call the traders in for their normal
6:30 meeting and you be honest with them.

50:47.652 --> 50:50.052
Because they're going to know
it's the end either way.

50:50.252 --> 50:53.132
You're going to have to throw them a bone,
and a pretty big one.

50:53.211 --> 50:55.535
And then you've got to
come out of the gates storming.

50:55.612 --> 50:57.772
No swaps. No nothing.

50:57.851 --> 51:00.055
40% done by 10:15. By 11:00,

51:00.131 --> 51:01.570
all your trades have to be gone

51:01.571 --> 51:03.895
because by lunchtime,
word's going to be out.

51:04.851 --> 51:08.810
And by 2:00 you're going to be selling
at 65 cents on the dollar, if you're lucky.

51:08.811 --> 51:11.692
And then the feds are going to be in here,
up your ass, trying to slow you down.

51:11.771 --> 51:12.938
Ramesh?

51:13.011 --> 51:15.530
They can slow you down.
They can't stop you.

51:15.531 --> 51:16.810
It's yours to sell.

51:16.811 --> 51:18.895
But, John, even if

51:19.811 --> 51:22.931
we manage to pull that off,
and that's saying something,

51:24.451 --> 51:27.331
the real question is,
who are we selling this to?

51:27.811 --> 51:30.299
Same people we've been selling it to
the last two years,

51:30.371 --> 51:31.970
and whoever else will buy it.

51:31.971 --> 51:34.219
But, John, if you do this,

51:35.570 --> 51:38.419
you will kill the market for years.
It's over.

51:40.571 --> 51:43.375
And you're selling something
that you know has no value.

51:43.810 --> 51:48.098
We are selling to willing buyers
of the current fair market price.

51:48.771 --> 51:52.130
So that we may survive.

51:52.131 --> 51:55.819
You will never sell anything
to any of those people ever again.

51:55.890 --> 51:57.134
I understand.

51:57.250 --> 51:58.975
- Do you?
- Do you?

52:00.171 --> 52:01.730
This is it!

52:01.731 --> 52:03.935
I'm telling you. This is it.

52:14.850 --> 52:16.171
Now, it's 4:00.

52:16.770 --> 52:19.775
Jared, you've got till 5:00 to
break this down and draw me up a plan.

52:19.810 --> 52:23.935
Is there anybody else who knows what's
in here at the moment, block by block?

52:24.610 --> 52:25.898
Eric Dale.

52:26.450 --> 52:27.574
And where is he?

52:27.970 --> 52:30.610
As of today, he's no longer with the firm.

52:30.930 --> 52:33.298
We have been trying to locate him.

52:37.050 --> 52:38.054
- Carmelo.
- Yes.

52:38.130 --> 52:40.138
Get me Eric Dale here by 6:30.

52:40.610 --> 52:41.811
It's done.

52:42.090 --> 52:44.010
We meet back here in an hour.

52:46.370 --> 52:48.050
Sam, let's talk.

53:00.770 --> 53:02.734
This is a hell of a town.

53:04.490 --> 53:07.371
I've always loved this place,
since the day I arrived.

53:07.449 --> 53:08.770
Everything about it.

53:17.290 --> 53:19.974
Sam, are you going to go with me on this?

53:21.770 --> 53:23.494
I don't know, John.

53:25.210 --> 53:27.010
This one is very ugly.

53:28.609 --> 53:30.573
You and I, we're salesmen.

53:31.329 --> 53:33.889
We sell. That's what we do.
It's not complicated.

53:33.890 --> 53:35.134
Exactly.

53:35.930 --> 53:38.417
And you know damn well
you don't sell anything to anybody

53:38.489 --> 53:40.333
unless you think they're gonna
come back for more.

53:40.409 --> 53:43.530
That's the lesson we learned.
And tomorrow, we're done.

53:44.050 --> 53:45.130
But this is it, Sam.

53:45.209 --> 53:47.337
You keep saying that.
What's that supposed to mean?

53:47.649 --> 53:49.329
This is the big one.

53:49.969 --> 53:52.653
Most of us aren't going to
make it out of this one.

53:52.729 --> 53:54.693
- Us?
- The Street.

53:55.649 --> 53:57.057
What are you talking about?

53:57.409 --> 53:59.973
This isn't the last situation
I'm gonna have to deal with this week.

54:00.049 --> 54:01.216
This is just the start.

54:01.729 --> 54:03.497
It's the start 'cause you're starting it.

54:03.809 --> 54:06.733
Maybe. But I don't believe that.
Not this time.

54:07.489 --> 54:09.617
The numbers,
they just don't add up any more.

54:09.689 --> 54:13.127
I agree with you there.
I've been saying that for years.

54:13.128 --> 54:16.293
If this kid out there can
come up with this, then...

54:17.248 --> 54:19.889
Look, I just don't think I can
walk in there knowing what I know

54:19.969 --> 54:21.574
and put the hammer down on these guys.

54:22.529 --> 54:24.613
When did you start getting so soft, Sam?

54:25.129 --> 54:27.856
Fuck you, soft. You're panicking

54:30.529 --> 54:34.774
If you're the first out of the door,
that's not called panicking.

54:40.448 --> 54:44.137
You're obviously operating
with more information than I have.

54:45.889 --> 54:48.496
But I think this will destroy this firm.

54:48.968 --> 54:50.528
No one will ever trust you again.

54:50.529 --> 54:53.256
You're knowingly putting people
out of business, full stop.

54:55.808 --> 54:58.012
You let me deal with that, Sam.

55:12.448 --> 55:13.495
How'd it go?

55:14.488 --> 55:16.529
This is a fucking shit show.

55:17.328 --> 55:19.772
- They're gonna go with it?
- Probably.

55:20.608 --> 55:21.732
Jesus.

55:23.408 --> 55:25.252
Remember this day, boys.

55:27.328 --> 55:28.932
Remember this day.

55:43.968 --> 55:46.052
So, what's the strategy here?

55:46.127 --> 55:47.328
That's where I'm headed right now.

55:47.408 --> 55:49.175
Downstairs to work on it with my guys.

55:49.248 --> 55:51.649
No, no. You and I with John.

55:57.168 --> 56:01.447
I'm not sure that we need one, Sarah.
That's not the way I do things.

56:01.448 --> 56:02.649
Please.

56:04.767 --> 56:07.528
Listen, he knows where we've stood on this

56:07.608 --> 56:08.928
all along.

56:09.567 --> 56:11.454
That's exactly my point.

56:11.968 --> 56:15.536
And knowing what was discussed
by both you and I,

56:16.007 --> 56:19.007
I don't see how this could
provide you with anything

56:19.008 --> 56:21.648
other than a false sense of comfort.

56:21.728 --> 56:24.848
I'm not looking for
a sense of comfort here, Sarah.

56:25.887 --> 56:28.451
I don't think there's one to be found.

56:38.527 --> 56:40.491
So, again, what's the strategy here?

56:42.887 --> 56:45.287
I'm just not sure
there's much more to do on this.

56:46.287 --> 56:47.892
It's very simple.

56:48.407 --> 56:51.168
Don't even think about fucking me on this.

56:52.167 --> 56:54.208
'Cause if we're going down,

56:55.287 --> 56:57.371
then you damn well know it'll be together.

56:58.927 --> 56:59.975
No.

57:00.767 --> 57:02.611
I'm not sure that I do know that.

57:23.847 --> 57:24.927
Hey.

57:25.566 --> 57:27.007
Oh, I'm sorry.

57:40.086 --> 57:42.847
What do you guys think
Tuld made last year?

57:44.847 --> 57:46.451
Would you shut the fuck up?

57:46.526 --> 57:47.934
86 million.

57:49.126 --> 57:51.046
In bonuses and salary.

57:51.966 --> 57:53.767
- Really?
- Sure, it's public record.

57:53.846 --> 57:56.050
That is a lot of fucking money.

57:57.207 --> 57:58.854
He was worth a billion.

57:58.926 --> 57:59.886
Was?

58:01.086 --> 58:02.374
Till today.

58:03.166 --> 58:04.367
Really?

58:05.886 --> 58:07.206
You'll see.

58:10.046 --> 58:12.774
I'm going to get some coffee.
You guys want anything else?

58:12.846 --> 58:15.574
- I'm all right.
- I could use some real air.

58:15.646 --> 58:17.566
- Probably a good idea.
- Is it all right, Will?

58:17.646 --> 58:19.534
- Is what all right?
- If I get out of here for a minute?

58:19.535 --> 58:21.245
Of course, it's not a prison.

58:21.246 --> 58:23.406
You want me to hold your hand?

58:27.846 --> 58:30.410
Why did they put all this fruit on it?

58:39.406 --> 58:41.404
Hello, Will Emerson.

58:41.405 --> 58:42.529
Hello.

58:46.006 --> 58:47.207
Right.

58:48.486 --> 58:50.766
No, thank you. I understand.

58:53.246 --> 58:55.133
No, we'll be discreet.

58:56.605 --> 58:57.893
Thank you.

58:58.525 --> 59:00.173
- What?
- Eric's wife.

59:00.686 --> 59:02.725
He's alive, he's home,
he doesn't want to speak to us,

59:02.726 --> 59:04.133
and he doesn't know that she rang me.

59:04.205 --> 59:05.810
- Where's he live?
- Heights.

59:06.205 --> 59:07.809
- Shall I call Tuld's guy?
- No.

59:08.285 --> 59:10.533
It's Eric. The last thing we need
is those guys going over there.

59:10.605 --> 59:12.011
No, you two go get him
and try to bring him here.

59:12.012 --> 59:14.373
- But you got to be back by 6:00 a.m.
- All right.

59:17.525 --> 59:19.130
I hate Brooklyn.

59:24.005 --> 59:25.010
May I come in?

59:25.085 --> 59:27.169
Of course. Please, sit down.

59:32.805 --> 59:33.809
So...

59:37.805 --> 59:39.933
We're going to do this thing.

59:42.925 --> 59:44.049
Okay.

59:45.284 --> 59:47.204
It's going to be tight.

59:48.925 --> 59:50.409
Is Sam on board?

59:50.765 --> 59:52.009
Not yet.

59:55.645 --> 59:56.933
Sarah,

59:57.525 --> 01:00:01.365
I need a head to feed to the traders
on the floor and the board.

01:00:05.884 --> 01:00:07.803
Is it me or Cohen?

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:09.092
It's you.

01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:22.128
Of course, you're well aware
that I filtered several warnings

01:00:22.204 --> 01:00:24.769
to you and Cohen about this a year ago.

01:00:25.204 --> 01:00:29.449
I really don't think that's the best path
for you to take at this point.

01:00:33.324 --> 01:00:36.128
You're going to be well taken care of here.

01:00:38.724 --> 01:00:40.449
Obviously, it is

01:00:41.444 --> 01:00:42.404
quite complicated.

01:00:42.484 --> 01:00:44.525
John, I was told under
no uncertain terms...

01:00:44.604 --> 01:00:46.723
It was always a very gray area.

01:00:46.724 --> 01:00:51.612
Actually, it was made very clear
at the time by you, me, and Cohen.

01:00:53.444 --> 01:00:56.891
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't fight me on this.

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:11.084
We all fucked this one up pretty good.

01:01:11.884 --> 01:01:13.008
Yes.

01:01:15.284 --> 01:01:17.283
We need you to stay here
until this is finished

01:01:17.284 --> 01:01:19.522
and the market's closed.

01:01:19.523 --> 01:01:20.931
I understand.

01:01:23.164 --> 01:01:26.568
They'll go over the numbers
with you downstairs.

01:01:26.643 --> 01:01:27.931
Good luck.

01:01:44.883 --> 01:01:46.803
Oh, fuck. Jared's coming.

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:50.045
What's the boy wonder want?

01:01:55.643 --> 01:01:57.967
- You got a minute?
- Just off to pick up Eric.

01:01:58.043 --> 01:01:59.723
Yeah. I know. It will only take a second.

01:01:59.804 --> 01:02:01.092
All right, what is it?

01:02:01.403 --> 01:02:03.684
Tuld and I have concerns that Sam

01:02:03.763 --> 01:02:06.612
may not be willing to step up
and do the right thing here.

01:02:07.003 --> 01:02:08.367
This has never been a problem.

01:02:08.444 --> 01:02:09.448
No, it hasn't.

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:12.808
But sometimes,
in acute situations such as this,

01:02:12.883 --> 01:02:18.044
often what is right can take on
multiple interpretations.

01:02:21.883 --> 01:02:23.324
Sam will step up.

01:02:23.403 --> 01:02:26.044
Oh, I know he will. But if he doesn't...

01:02:27.522 --> 01:02:30.566
But if he doesn't,
we need to know that you will.

01:02:32.643 --> 01:02:33.603
Thank you.

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:36.007
You need to know that I will what?

01:02:36.083 --> 01:02:37.763
That you'll step up.

01:02:39.363 --> 01:02:42.124
I have no doubt that
Sam will make the right decision.

01:02:42.202 --> 01:02:43.841
But just to make it clear,

01:02:43.842 --> 01:02:46.450
he and I have always had
the same interpretation of what's right,

01:02:48.443 --> 01:02:50.843
no matter how acute the situation.

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.839
Jesus, that's a nice place.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.044
Yeah, it is. He just bought it.

01:05:35.601 --> 01:05:37.281
I hope it was with cash.

01:05:38.361 --> 01:05:40.925
Fuck me,
you're a heartless little shit sometimes.

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.121
And it wasn't.

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.128
Don't touch any of the buttons.

01:05:54.281 --> 01:05:56.441
- What are you doing here?
- Hey.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.044
So, Peter finished the model
you were working on.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.804
Really?

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.681
It caused a shit storm.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.568
I bet it did.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.888
You think he's right?

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.244
I know he's right.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.447
Fuck.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.688
All right.

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.888
So Jared Cohen called
an emergency meeting

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.521
with the senior partners last night.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.080
And based on your findings,

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:37.248
they've decided to liquidate
our entire position.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.760
Today.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.124
I'm very sorry about that.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:52.364
They're worried about you being out here
and they want me to bring you back.

01:06:53.039 --> 01:06:54.206
Please.

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.478
I'm just saying.

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:58.039
- Fuck them. Fuck them.
- Eric...

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.604
- Don't be rash.
- Forget it. I signed my paper. I'm out.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.080
- They'll pay you.
- They got nothing on me.

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.207
They'll pay you.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.168
I've been paid enough already.

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.159
Fuck.

01:07:15.319 --> 01:07:17.687
Do you know I built a bridge once?

01:07:18.439 --> 01:07:20.087
- Sorry?
- A bridge.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.920
No, I didn't know that.

01:07:22.999 --> 01:07:25.127
I was an engineer by trade.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:31.164
It went from Dilles Bottom, Ohio,
to Moundsville, West Virginia.

01:07:31.239 --> 01:07:33.918
It spanned 912 feet above the Ohio River.

01:07:33.919 --> 01:07:36.407
12,100 people use this thing a day.

01:07:37.159 --> 01:07:40.367
And it cut out 35 miles
of extra driving each way

01:07:40.439 --> 01:07:42.763
between Wheeling and New Martinsville.

01:07:42.839 --> 01:07:47.564
That's a combined 847,000 miles
of driving a day.

01:07:48.999 --> 01:07:52.643
Or 25,410,000 miles a month.

01:07:54.199 --> 01:08:00.168
And 304,920,000 miles a year saved.

01:08:01.399 --> 01:08:05.404
Now, I completed that project in 1986.
That's 22 years ago.

01:08:06.439 --> 01:08:08.523
So over the life of that one bridge,

01:08:08.598 --> 01:08:14.447
that's 6,708,240,000 miles

01:08:14.518 --> 01:08:17.237
that haven't had to be driven at...

01:08:17.238 --> 01:08:19.562
What? Let's say 50 miles an hour.

01:08:19.639 --> 01:08:21.647
So that's what?

01:08:21.719 --> 01:08:25.243
That's 134,164,800 hours.

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:28.243
Or 559,020 days.

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:31.517
So that one little bridge
has saved the people

01:08:31.518 --> 01:08:32.805
of those two communities a combined

01:08:32.877 --> 01:08:36.206
1,531 years of their lives

01:08:37.198 --> 01:08:39.327
not wasted in a fucking car.

01:08:42.999 --> 01:08:46.118
1,531 years.

01:08:46.679 --> 01:08:47.803
Jesus.

01:08:58.837 --> 01:09:01.446
I guess you better get back over there.

01:09:05.318 --> 01:09:06.398
Yeah.

01:09:10.078 --> 01:09:11.877
Thanks for coming by.

01:09:11.957 --> 01:09:13.441
You're welcome.

01:09:17.478 --> 01:09:18.886
Who the fuck is this?

01:09:18.957 --> 01:09:21.397
I would imagine it's the firm's people.

01:09:21.398 --> 01:09:22.564
What?

01:09:22.997 --> 01:09:25.246
They don't want any loose ends.

01:09:26.718 --> 01:09:29.086
They fired me. Fuck them. Fuck them.

01:09:29.358 --> 01:09:32.685
I totally agree. Fuck them.
So come back, take the money,

01:09:32.758 --> 01:09:34.397
you'll be home by 5:00.

01:09:34.398 --> 01:09:36.002
Otherwise, they're going to
fight you on everything.

01:09:36.002 --> 01:09:39.206
They're going to fight you
on your package, your options, everything.

01:09:39.837 --> 01:09:41.081
Be smart.

01:09:47.158 --> 01:09:49.526
Well, you're a better man than me.

01:09:50.198 --> 01:09:52.761
- That's always been true.
- Yes, it has.

01:09:58.037 --> 01:09:59.521
House looks good.

01:10:01.117 --> 01:10:02.285
Thanks.

01:10:03.717 --> 01:10:05.005
Hey, Eric.

01:10:05.798 --> 01:10:08.886
Don't beat yourself up too much
about this stuff, all right?

01:10:10.157 --> 01:10:13.245
Some people like driving
the long way home.

01:10:13.317 --> 01:10:15.281
Who the fuck knows, right?

01:10:46.237 --> 01:10:47.645
There he is.

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:50.001
John.

01:10:51.557 --> 01:10:53.161
How's it looking?

01:10:53.837 --> 01:10:56.445
Cohen's doing a nice job. It could work.

01:10:56.876 --> 01:10:58.557
What does that mean?

01:10:59.917 --> 01:11:01.204
It means,

01:11:01.717 --> 01:11:03.484
as you very well know,

01:11:04.436 --> 01:11:07.524
that you're a very important piece
of this puzzle.

01:11:38.236 --> 01:11:39.841
That's very generous.

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:41.717
It's not a gift.

01:11:41.996 --> 01:11:44.560
I need to know you're with me on this.

01:11:47.716 --> 01:11:49.277
I'm with the firm, John.

01:11:51.956 --> 01:11:54.237
I won't get what I need from your boys
on the floor

01:11:54.316 --> 01:11:55.517
unless they believe you.

01:11:57.596 --> 01:12:00.237
Unless they believe in you completely.

01:12:04.316 --> 01:12:06.041
Are you in on this?

01:12:07.635 --> 01:12:09.240
I've told you my reservations.

01:12:09.555 --> 01:12:11.400
You can't have reservations.

01:12:12.636 --> 01:12:14.523
And I need to know now.

01:12:16.756 --> 01:12:20.444
Well, John, I am completely with the firm,
as I always have been.

01:12:20.516 --> 01:12:21.804
Excuse me.

01:12:48.835 --> 01:12:51.083
All right, Will, am I getting fired?

01:12:51.876 --> 01:12:53.283
I don't know.

01:12:56.475 --> 01:12:57.555
Yeah.

01:12:58.675 --> 01:13:00.519
Almost definitely. Yes.

01:13:02.995 --> 01:13:04.556
- Are you?
- No.

01:13:07.075 --> 01:13:08.439
Seth, it's nothing you did.

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.596
You're just in the wrong firm
at the wrong time.

01:13:10.675 --> 01:13:13.076
Young guys are always
the first to get culled.

01:13:13.475 --> 01:13:15.843
Listen, nothing I'm gonna say
is going to make you feel any better.

01:13:15.844 --> 01:13:19.436
It's just going to suck for a while,
and then you'll be fine.

01:13:23.555 --> 01:13:24.756
You all right?

01:13:26.595 --> 01:13:28.123
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:13:28.715 --> 01:13:32.196
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry this is happening to you.

01:13:33.715 --> 01:13:35.994
Don't be. You didn't do it to me.

01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:38.876
Still, at least you're going to have
some nice cash to walk away with.

01:13:39.315 --> 01:13:40.755
I guess.

01:13:40.835 --> 01:13:42.363
Shit, this is really
going to affect people.

01:13:42.435 --> 01:13:43.962
Yeah, it's going to affect people like me.

01:13:44.035 --> 01:13:46.763
No. No. Real people.

01:13:47.395 --> 01:13:48.922
Jesus, Seth.

01:13:48.994 --> 01:13:50.837
Listen, if you really want to
do this with your life,

01:13:50.838 --> 01:13:52.919
you have to believe you're necessary.
And you are.

01:13:53.435 --> 01:13:55.037
People want to live like
this, in their cars

01:13:55.038 --> 01:13:57.402
and the big fucking houses
they can't even pay for,

01:13:57.475 --> 01:13:58.916
then you're necessary.

01:13:58.994 --> 01:14:01.714
The only reason that they all get to
continue living like kings

01:14:01.715 --> 01:14:04.596
is because we've got our fingers
on the scales in their favor.

01:14:04.674 --> 01:14:06.673
I take my hand off,

01:14:06.674 --> 01:14:10.393
then the whole world gets really
fucking fair really fucking quickly,

01:14:10.394 --> 01:14:13.122
and nobody actually wants that.
They say they do, but they don't

01:14:13.194 --> 01:14:15.159
They want what we have to give them,

01:14:15.234 --> 01:14:17.602
but they also want to play innocent

01:14:17.674 --> 01:14:19.398
and pretend they have no idea
where it came from.

01:14:19.474 --> 01:14:21.274
That's more hypocrisy
than I'm willing to swallow.

01:14:21.354 --> 01:14:23.918
So fuck... Fuck normal people.

01:14:24.554 --> 01:14:28.199
The funny thing is, tomorrow,
if all of this goes tits up

01:14:28.514 --> 01:14:31.679
they're going to crucify us
for being too reckless.

01:14:31.755 --> 01:14:33.555
But if we're wrong

01:14:33.634 --> 01:14:36.155
and everything gets back on track,

01:14:36.234 --> 01:14:38.673
then the same people are going to
laugh till they piss their pants,

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:40.158
'cause we're gonna look like
the biggest pussies

01:14:40.234 --> 01:14:42.362
God ever let through the door.

01:14:46.354 --> 01:14:47.762
You think we're going to be wrong?

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:51.994
No, they're all fucked.

01:15:07.153 --> 01:15:08.277
Good morning.

01:15:08.994 --> 01:15:10.118
Peter.

01:15:10.674 --> 01:15:12.114
You want one?

01:15:12.793 --> 01:15:13.917
I don't smoke.

01:15:13.994 --> 01:15:16.155
Oh, that's good. I don't much either.

01:15:28.354 --> 01:15:29.642
You tired?

01:15:30.594 --> 01:15:33.398
Of what? Remember,
I don't work as hard as you.

01:15:33.474 --> 01:15:34.521
That's not true.

01:15:34.593 --> 01:15:36.273
No, it is, actually.

01:15:40.073 --> 01:15:41.601
We all getting fired tonight?

01:15:41.674 --> 01:15:42.874
Probably.

01:15:44.113 --> 01:15:46.232
Are they going to fire you?

01:15:46.233 --> 01:15:48.481
They won't exactly call it that.

01:15:50.073 --> 01:15:51.633
It'll be a mercy killing, really.

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:54.518
You don't have to stand out here for me.

01:15:54.594 --> 01:15:55.957
No, I don't

01:15:56.593 --> 01:15:59.321
really want to go back in there just yet.

01:15:59.793 --> 01:16:01.398
I understand that.

01:16:03.633 --> 01:16:05.314
I think I know your son.

01:16:05.673 --> 01:16:06.917
Really?

01:16:06.993 --> 01:16:10.081
Not well, but he always seemed
like a nice person.

01:16:10.673 --> 01:16:12.320
He is a nice person.

01:16:12.793 --> 01:16:15.761
I guess you could say worse things
about a guy.

01:16:16.553 --> 01:16:18.997
Does he know what's about to happen?

01:16:19.473 --> 01:16:20.913
What do you mean?

01:16:21.993 --> 01:16:23.673
Did you talk to him?

01:16:24.753 --> 01:16:26.794
No, I hadn't even thought...

01:16:33.473 --> 01:16:35.481
They are all coming in now.

01:16:36.673 --> 01:16:38.157
Yes, they are.

01:16:43.113 --> 01:16:45.633
Have you ever done anything like this?

01:16:46.233 --> 01:16:48.436
No, never. Not even close.

01:16:51.873 --> 01:16:52.952
Yeah.

01:16:55.832 --> 01:16:58.200
Are you sure it's the only,

01:16:59.672 --> 01:17:01.592
or the right thing to do?

01:17:04.793 --> 01:17:06.037
For who?

01:17:08.513 --> 01:17:09.921
I'm not sure.

01:17:10.712 --> 01:17:12.152
Neither am I.

01:17:45.151 --> 01:17:46.395
Oh, God.

01:18:51.991 --> 01:18:53.432
You all right?

01:18:55.511 --> 01:18:57.398
You're about to fire me.

01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:16.272
This is all I ever wanted to do.

01:19:23.190 --> 01:19:24.434
Really?

01:19:51.951 --> 01:19:54.198
They're almost ready for you,
Ms. Robertson. Couple of minutes.

01:19:58.831 --> 01:20:00.194
You as well?

01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:02.034
Yes.

01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:04.030
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

01:20:06.791 --> 01:20:08.471
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:26.071
I didn't think they were going to
be able to get you back here.

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:29.592
Well, they told me they were going to

01:20:29.593 --> 01:20:31.838
drag me through hell on everything
over the next two years,

01:20:31.909 --> 01:20:33.918
my options, my health care.

01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:36.917
Or I could come back here and make

01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:41.591
$176,471 an hour

01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:44.033
to sit quietly in this room.

01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:47.674
Didn't seem like much of a choice.

01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:50.030
It never is.

01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:58.071
Obviously, looking back,
it was expressed with

01:20:59.069 --> 01:21:00.869
insufficient urgency,

01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:05.070
but your point was passed on.
I need you to know that.

01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:06.634
Eric.

01:21:07.149 --> 01:21:09.594
It's okay. I understand.

01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:12.310
Believe me. There was nothing else
you could have done.

01:21:13.069 --> 01:21:14.357
I guess.

01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:20.478
At the time, it didn't seem like
there was much of a choice.

01:21:21.269 --> 01:21:22.752
It never does.

01:21:32.949 --> 01:21:34.673
You have kids, yeah?

01:21:44.269 --> 01:21:46.997
So, what's your package going to be like?

01:21:49.429 --> 01:21:52.113
I don't know.
That's what I'm waiting for now.

01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:54.989
It's probably going to be pretty good.

01:21:56.269 --> 01:21:57.709
It better be.

01:22:12.749 --> 01:22:16.267
Thank you all for coming in
a little early this morning.

01:22:16.268 --> 01:22:17.469
I know yesterday was pretty bad,

01:22:17.548 --> 01:22:19.468
and I wish I could say that
today's gonna be less so,

01:22:19.469 --> 01:22:21.716
but that isn't going to be the case.

01:22:21.788 --> 01:22:23.708
Now, I'm supposed to read
this statement to you all here.

01:22:23.789 --> 01:22:25.229
But why don't you just
read it on your own time,

01:22:25.309 --> 01:22:27.829
and I'll just tell you
what the fuck is going on here.

01:22:28.829 --> 01:22:32.909
I've been here all night
meeting with the executive committee,

01:22:33.909 --> 01:22:36.948
and the decision has been made
to unwind a considerable portion

01:22:36.949 --> 01:22:40.189
of the firm's holdings
and several key asset classes.

01:22:42.989 --> 01:22:45.716
The crux of it is, in the firm's thinking,

01:22:46.348 --> 01:22:48.868
the party is over as of this morning.

01:22:49.588 --> 01:22:53.909
There's gonna be considerable turmoil
in the markets for the foreseeable future,

01:22:53.988 --> 01:22:58.996
and they believe it is better
that this turmoil begin with us.

01:23:00.588 --> 01:23:02.268
As a result,

01:23:02.348 --> 01:23:04.792
the firm has decided to liquidate

01:23:04.868 --> 01:23:08.993
its majority position
of fixed income MBS today.

01:23:10.987 --> 01:23:12.471
These are your packets.

01:23:12.548 --> 01:23:15.952
You will see what accounts
you're responsible for today.

01:23:17.068 --> 01:23:19.436
I'm sure it hasn't taken you long

01:23:20.828 --> 01:23:23.346
to understand the implications of this sale

01:23:23.347 --> 01:23:25.266
on your relationships
with your counterparties

01:23:25.267 --> 01:23:26.872
and, as a result,

01:23:28.308 --> 01:23:29.355
on your careers.

01:23:30.028 --> 01:23:34.033
I have expressed this reality
to the executive committee,

01:23:34.108 --> 01:23:35.548
and they understand.

01:23:35.827 --> 01:23:37.267
As a result,

01:23:37.268 --> 01:23:40.786
if you achieve a 93% sale of your assets,

01:23:40.787 --> 01:23:45.708
you will receive
a $1.4 million one-off bonus.

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:49.871
If the floor as a whole
achieves a 93% sale,

01:23:50.308 --> 01:23:55.437
you will get an additional
$1.3 million apiece.

01:23:56.748 --> 01:23:59.672
For those of you who have
never been through this before,

01:23:59.747 --> 01:24:02.355
this is what the beginning
of a fire sale looks like.

01:24:02.587 --> 01:24:06.068
I cannot begin to tell you how important
the first hour and a half is gonna be.

01:24:06.147 --> 01:24:08.592
I want you to hit every bite you can find.

01:24:08.667 --> 01:24:12.586
Dealers, brokers, clients.
Your mother, if she's buying.

01:24:12.587 --> 01:24:14.671
And, no swaps.

01:24:15.507 --> 01:24:17.548
It's outgoing only. Today.

01:24:20.787 --> 01:24:25.074
Obviously, this is not going down
the way that any of us would have hoped.

01:24:25.787 --> 01:24:28.586
But the ground is shifting below our feet,

01:24:28.587 --> 01:24:31.315
and apparently there's no other way out.

01:24:49.346 --> 01:24:50.394
Guys,

01:24:53.067 --> 01:24:56.111
this is obviously
a very, very unique situation.

01:24:57.026 --> 01:24:59.465
If we are successful today,

01:24:59.466 --> 01:25:02.914
we will have been successful
in destroying our own jobs.

01:25:04.426 --> 01:25:07.350
I cannot promise that
any of you, all of you,

01:25:08.187 --> 01:25:11.231
some of you will be
repositioned within the firm.

01:25:12.506 --> 01:25:17.351
But I can tell you that I am very proud of
the work that we have done here together.

01:25:19.426 --> 01:25:23.147
I've been at this place 34 years,

01:25:24.226 --> 01:25:26.594
and I can tell you from experience
that people are going to say

01:25:26.666 --> 01:25:29.705
some very nasty things
about what we do here today

01:25:29.706 --> 01:25:33.275
and about what you've dedicated
a portion of your lives to.

01:25:34.026 --> 01:25:35.030
But,

01:25:36.186 --> 01:25:40.791
have faith that in the bigger picture,
our skills have not been wasted.

01:25:41.546 --> 01:25:43.505
We have accomplished much,

01:25:43.506 --> 01:25:46.310
and our talents have been used

01:25:48.586 --> 01:25:50.430
for the greater good.

01:25:51.266 --> 01:25:53.547
Here's your packets. Get to work.

01:26:27.626 --> 01:26:29.546
<i>- City this is Eric.
- Give me Elliot.</i>

01:26:30.825 --> 01:26:32.471
<i>- City.
- Hey, it's Will Emerson.</i>

01:26:32.472 --> 01:26:33.543
<i>William, how are you?</i>

01:26:33.544 --> 01:26:35.311
I'm all right.
How's the trouble and strife?

01:26:35.312 --> 01:26:36.473
<i>Busting my ass, as always.</i>

01:26:36.546 --> 01:26:39.066
You see, that's what I tried to tell you,
John. Why do you think I'm single?

01:26:39.146 --> 01:26:40.944
<i>I know you did.
What can I do for you?</i>

01:26:40.945 --> 01:26:42.593
Listen. I just got the tap on my shoulder,

01:26:42.665 --> 01:26:44.585
and we've got some risk over here
that we need to move.

01:26:44.586 --> 01:26:46.864
So today it looks like
my loss is your gain.

01:26:46.865 --> 01:26:48.153
<i>What kind of size are we talking?</i>

01:26:48.225 --> 01:26:50.344
It should be on your screen.
I just sent it.

01:26:50.345 --> 01:26:51.993
<i>Jesus! Where does this land?</i>

01:26:52.065 --> 01:26:53.864
<i>- 96 on the dollar.
- 91.</i>

01:26:53.865 --> 01:26:55.349
All three and we're done at 94.

01:26:55.425 --> 01:26:57.389
<i>- Ninety-three and a half
- Done.</i>

01:26:59.306 --> 01:27:00.669
<i>- Trading.
- Hello, gorgeous.</i>

01:27:00.745 --> 01:27:02.349
<i>Will, what's happening over there?</i>

01:27:02.425 --> 01:27:03.866
Well, today's moving day.

01:27:03.945 --> 01:27:05.713
<i>Fuck are you guys so
worked up about?</i>

01:27:05.714 --> 01:27:09.469
You think they tell me anything? All I know
is that today, my loss is your gain.

01:27:09.545 --> 01:27:11.629
Now you're a friendly,
so I've come to you first.

01:27:11.705 --> 01:27:15.504
I got 270 mil at 15 year
paying out a point and a half above par.

01:27:15.539 --> 01:27:18.232
<i>- Where's it from?
- Where's it from? Do you care?</i>

01:27:18.625 --> 01:27:19.792
<i>No, not really.</i>

01:27:19.865 --> 01:27:21.588
<i>Now, where's the trade?
I'm hearing things...</i>

01:27:21.589 --> 01:27:23.309
<i>- Alexis...
- You guys are scaring me a little.</i>

01:27:23.385 --> 01:27:26.353
I'm only sharing this
with you right now. 85.

01:27:27.705 --> 01:27:28.709
<i>Done.</i>

01:27:30.864 --> 01:27:33.112
<i>- Deutsche.
- It's Will Emerson.</i>

01:27:33.185 --> 01:27:34.985
<i>Fuck you, you limey bastard.</i>

01:27:35.065 --> 01:27:36.593
Come on, are you still angry about that?

01:27:36.594 --> 01:27:38.833
<i>Word is out. I'm hanging up now.</i>

01:27:40.145 --> 01:27:41.553
<i>- Merrill.
- Lawrence!</i>

01:27:41.625 --> 01:27:43.512
<i>What the fuck are
you guys doing over there?</i>

01:27:43.585 --> 01:27:45.746
<i>- Just a little spring cleaning.
- That is not what I'm hearing.</i>

01:27:45.824 --> 01:27:47.385
All right, Lawrence, are you a buyer?

01:27:47.464 --> 01:27:49.264
<i>I'm not sure any more. Where at?</i>

01:27:49.345 --> 01:27:50.949
Well, it sounds like
I should be asking you where at.

01:27:51.105 --> 01:27:52.152
<i>What are we talking about here?</i>

01:27:52.225 --> 01:27:54.503
Three hundred seventy-five mil
at 30 year mixed.

01:27:54.504 --> 01:27:56.872
<i>- Fuck me.
- Are you with me on this?</i>

01:27:57.504 --> 01:27:59.708
<i>- Sixty-three cents.
- Oh, fuck you. I'm hanging up.</i>

01:27:59.785 --> 01:28:01.225
<i>Sixty-three.</i>

01:28:01.985 --> 01:28:04.113
Let me call my man here.
I'll come back to you in five.

01:28:04.114 --> 01:28:06.224
<i>It may be 55 in 5.</i>

01:28:06.225 --> 01:28:08.986
Well, all right, then. Stay on the line.

01:28:09.064 --> 01:28:11.183
Sam, pick up the phone.

01:28:11.184 --> 01:28:13.552
<i>- Sam, get on the line!
- Yeah.</i>

01:28:13.625 --> 01:28:15.152
<i>- I got Lawrence at Merrill.
- Where are we?</i>

01:28:15.224 --> 01:28:16.904
<i>- Sixty-three cents.
- Jesus.</i>

01:28:16.984 --> 01:28:19.343
<i>- On what?
- 375 mix 30.</i>

01:28:19.344 --> 01:28:20.904
<i>Get him to 65 and hit it.</i>

01:28:20.905 --> 01:28:22.825
Are you fucking kidding me? That's...

01:28:22.904 --> 01:28:26.189
What is that? That's a $131
million loss on a single trade.

01:28:26.265 --> 01:28:28.349
<i>I understand. Hit it.</i>

01:28:29.584 --> 01:28:32.268
Hey, Lawrence. We're fill or kill at 65.

01:28:32.584 --> 01:28:33.708
<i>It's filled.</i>

01:28:56.384 --> 01:28:57.628
Well done.

01:29:04.384 --> 01:29:05.868
I just want to give you a heads up.

01:29:05.943 --> 01:29:09.064
They're going to start sending
a few people home now.

01:29:11.464 --> 01:29:12.468
Now?

01:29:12.543 --> 01:29:14.431
Yes, Sam. No loose ends.

01:29:20.583 --> 01:29:21.871
Of course.

01:29:23.144 --> 01:29:25.031
And for what it's worth,

01:29:26.024 --> 01:29:27.628
you're still good.

01:29:30.424 --> 01:29:33.544
Yeah, I guess someone upstairs
really likes you.

01:30:25.783 --> 01:30:26.862
Sam.

01:30:28.263 --> 01:30:29.746
Please, sit.

01:30:29.823 --> 01:30:32.311
Congratulations are clearly in order.

01:30:33.022 --> 01:30:35.150
They did the best they could.

01:30:35.943 --> 01:30:39.707
You did a hell of a job.
And I thank you for it. Come on, sit.

01:30:40.422 --> 01:30:41.666
Excuse me for eating,

01:30:43.462 --> 01:30:45.143
but it's been a long day.

01:30:45.222 --> 01:30:48.146
- Can I get you something?
- No, nothing. Thanks.

01:30:51.262 --> 01:30:53.106
So, what can I do for you?

01:30:53.182 --> 01:30:54.623
I want out.

01:30:56.102 --> 01:30:57.947
I'm done. I want out.

01:31:00.182 --> 01:31:02.986
- It's been a very difficult day for everyone.
- I need you to release my options,

01:31:02.987 --> 01:31:05.541
if they're worth anything after today.
I want my bonus. I'm out.

01:31:05.542 --> 01:31:08.303
You'll get your bonus, your options,
and keep your current base.

01:31:08.382 --> 01:31:11.666
But I need you to stay with me
for the next 24 months, okay?

01:31:15.462 --> 01:31:17.381
Oh, come on, Sam.

01:31:17.382 --> 01:31:18.506
Put a smile on your face.

01:31:18.507 --> 01:31:21.381
You did some good today.
You said that yourself.

01:31:21.382 --> 01:31:24.590
Do you know, I'm starting to feel
a little better about this whole thing.

01:31:26.662 --> 01:31:29.423
You're one of the luckiest guys
in the world, Sam.

01:31:29.501 --> 01:31:31.269
Could have been digging
ditches all these years.

01:31:32.422 --> 01:31:33.710
That's true.

01:31:33.782 --> 01:31:37.503
And if I had, at least there'd be
some holes in the ground to show for it.

01:31:39.142 --> 01:31:40.141
Jesus.

01:31:40.142 --> 01:31:43.470
I just don't know
how we fucked this up quite so much.

01:31:47.302 --> 01:31:49.266
When did you start feeling
so sorry for yourself?

01:31:49.267 --> 01:31:51.061
It's unbearable. What?

01:31:51.622 --> 01:31:54.862
So you think we might have put
a few people out of business today.

01:31:54.942 --> 01:31:56.742
That's all for naught.

01:31:57.621 --> 01:32:01.505
But you've been doing that every day
for almost 40 years, Sam.

01:32:02.741 --> 01:32:06.506
And if this is all for naught,
then so is everything out there.

01:32:09.141 --> 01:32:10.789
It's just money.

01:32:11.381 --> 01:32:12.909
It's made up,

01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:15.225
pieces of paper with pictures on it

01:32:15.301 --> 01:32:19.065
so that we don't have to kill each other
just to get something to eat.

01:32:19.621 --> 01:32:21.062
It's not wrong.

01:32:21.541 --> 01:32:24.585
And it's certainly no different today
than it's ever been.

01:32:25.901 --> 01:32:28.662
1637, 1797,

01:32:28.741 --> 01:32:32.941
1819,1837, 1857,1884,

01:32:34.781 --> 01:32:36.745
1901, 1907,

01:32:37.181 --> 01:32:40.105
1929, 1937, 1974,

01:32:40.861 --> 01:32:43.785
1987, Jesus.
Didn't that fucker fuck me up good.

01:32:43.861 --> 01:32:46.862
1992, 1997, 2000,
and whatever we want to call this.

01:32:46.941 --> 01:32:50.705
It's all just the same thing, over and over.
We can't help ourselves.

01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:54.980
And you and I can't control it

01:32:54.981 --> 01:32:57.742
or stop it or even slow it.

01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:59.981
Or even ever so slightly alter it.

01:33:00.901 --> 01:33:02.384
We just react.

01:33:03.221 --> 01:33:05.425
And we make a lot of money
if we get it right.

01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:08.349
And we get left by the side of the road
if we get it wrong.

01:33:08.421 --> 01:33:10.188
And there have always been
and there always will be

01:33:10.261 --> 01:33:11.865
the same percentage of winners and losers,

01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:13.228
happy fucks and sad sacks,

01:33:13.301 --> 01:33:15.985
fat cats and starving dogs in this world.

01:33:17.941 --> 01:33:18.988
Yeah.

01:33:20.421 --> 01:33:23.339
There may be more of us today
than there's ever been.

01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:26.625
But the percentages,
they stay exactly the same.

01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:49.059
I'll do it, John,
but not because of your little speech.

01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:51.189
But because I need the money.

01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:56.942
Hard to believe after all these years,
but I need the money.

01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:01.427
This is the executive dining room.

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:04.020
- Do you want coffee or tea?
- No.

01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:09.947
You gonna keep the kid?

01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:13.704
Keep him? He's getting promoted.

01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:16.267
It's all hands on deck now, Sam.

01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:18.664
There's going to be a lot of money
to be made coming out of this mess,

01:34:18.665 --> 01:34:22.228
and we're gonna need
all the brains we can get around here.

01:35:42.979 --> 01:35:44.267
Hello.

01:35:45.659 --> 01:35:47.307
I've called the police.

01:35:47.379 --> 01:35:48.503
Mary.

01:35:49.139 --> 01:35:50.579
- Sam.
- Yep.

01:35:53.299 --> 01:35:54.979
What are you doing?

01:36:10.299 --> 01:36:12.186
Sam, what are you doing?

01:36:14.218 --> 01:36:15.702
Ella died.

01:36:40.258 --> 01:36:44.546
I was driving home from the vet
and I couldn't think of where else to go.

01:36:45.978 --> 01:36:48.663
- She belongs here.
- I know.

01:36:48.738 --> 01:36:50.942
But, Sam, you don't live here anymore.

01:36:56.858 --> 01:36:58.505
Are you all right?

01:36:59.618 --> 01:37:01.462
You don't look so good.

01:37:03.178 --> 01:37:05.262
Yeah, it's been a rough day
all the way around.

01:37:05.338 --> 01:37:07.063
I know, Sammy called.

01:37:07.458 --> 01:37:08.462
Is he all right?

01:37:08.538 --> 01:37:11.462
They got hammered, but they got out alive.

01:37:11.537 --> 01:37:12.585
Good.

01:37:20.098 --> 01:37:22.421
Well, I'm gonna go back inside

01:37:24.498 --> 01:37:25.906
and go back to bed.

01:37:27.057 --> 01:37:29.818
The alarm is on, so don't try and break in.

01:37:38.817 --> 01:37:40.617
Take care of yourself.
