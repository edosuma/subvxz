♪

00:06.297 --> 00:08.799
(laughing)

00:08.799 --> 00:11.392
Let's recap today's PE class.

00:11.392 --> 00:14.225
We see Frankie Wong
in deep right field,

00:14.225 --> 00:17.638
a made up position created
especially for her!

00:17.638 --> 00:19.900
Here's the pitch!
It's a high fly ball!

00:19.900 --> 00:21.692
Wong is under it...

00:21.692 --> 00:23.604
but she's facing
the wrong way!

00:23.604 --> 00:26.357
And we've never
seen this before!

00:26.357 --> 00:28.409
She catches the ball!

00:28.409 --> 00:30.781
With her face!

00:30.781 --> 00:32.073
(laughs)

00:32.073 --> 00:34.365
That was so funny.

00:34.365 --> 00:35.786
I want to remember this forever.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.459
I'll e-mail
this memory to myself,

00:38.459 --> 00:40.000
then I'll start
a shared document

00:40.000 --> 00:42.253
that we can both update
whenever we...

00:42.253 --> 00:43.714
And you're just writing
on the wall.

00:45.426 --> 00:47.258
The Wall of Memories.

00:47.258 --> 00:49.970
Not to be confused
with the Wall of Aggression.

00:52.633 --> 00:54.385
Wow.

00:54.385 --> 00:57.178
Your parents
really don't have any rules
about the walls here, do they?

01:00.231 --> 01:02.853
Three years worth
of priceless memories

01:02.853 --> 01:04.444
and inside jokes.

01:04.444 --> 01:07.278
(both sniff, sigh)

01:07.278 --> 01:08.649
Smells like friendship.

01:08.649 --> 01:11.492
And semi-toxic markers.

01:11.492 --> 01:14.245
(gasps) Oh! The time
I lost at baseball

01:14.245 --> 01:15.536
but won at faceball.

01:15.536 --> 01:18.159

01:41.602 --> 01:43.644
Don't your parents ever get mad
at you for doing that?

Oh no, she answered
a question with a question.

02:52.553 --> 02:54.295
Let's go before she ropes us in.

02:54.295 --> 02:56.387
My fans requested
a Best Friend Tag.

02:56.387 --> 02:58.599
Agh!

02:58.599 --> 03:00.971
And I have
to upload it this week.

03:00.971 --> 03:03.564
In my seven years
of making videos,

03:03.564 --> 03:05.896
I've never missed
posting one.

03:05.896 --> 03:07.187
Not even during

03:07.187 --> 03:11.232
The Great Eyeshadow
Shortage of 2012.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.234
How hard is it to do
a Best Friend Tag?

03:13.234 --> 03:15.526
You just grab your best friend
and answer questions about them.

03:15.526 --> 03:17.117
Watch.

03:17.117 --> 03:19.700
-What's my favorite--
-Arbor Day, penguins,
ugly babies,

03:19.700 --> 03:21.662
and the smell of pizza
when you're not expecting it.

03:21.662 --> 03:22.783
Nailed it!

03:26.497 --> 03:28.038
I've been trying to get
my best friend Becky

03:28.038 --> 03:31.332
to shoot the Best Friend Tag
with me, but she's been
super busy.

03:31.332 --> 03:32.673
Becky?

03:32.673 --> 03:34.635
I've never heard you
mention a Becky before.

03:34.635 --> 03:36.967
Oh, yeah.
We've been friends forever.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.929
I mean, I'm sure
I've mentioned Megan before.

03:38.929 --> 03:41.051
I thought you said
her name was Becky.

03:41.051 --> 03:43.143
Oh. Yeah, it is.

03:43.143 --> 03:46.056
Well, her name's really Megan,
but she just goes by Becky.

03:46.056 --> 03:47.478
Suspicious.

03:48.939 --> 03:50.941
So where does
this Becky-Megan live?

03:50.941 --> 03:53.063
Um, she moves around a lot.

03:53.063 --> 03:54.945
Right now, she's in...

03:54.945 --> 03:56.277
What's that island?

03:56.277 --> 03:57.948
-Uh, Fiji?
-Yeah!

03:59.700 --> 04:01.452
I miss her so much.

04:01.452 --> 04:04.455
So do you have
a picture of Becky?

04:04.455 --> 04:05.866
Of course.

04:07.458 --> 04:10.210
Here's a picture
of her and her cat.

04:10.210 --> 04:11.542
All I see is the cat.

04:11.542 --> 04:13.634
Well, that's Becky's thumb.

04:13.634 --> 04:15.296
Aww...

04:15.296 --> 04:17.468
I miss her thumb so much.

04:23.844 --> 04:25.646
All right, Dareheads,

04:25.646 --> 04:29.440
we've souped-up
a ball return machine...

04:29.440 --> 04:31.892
and signed all
the legal paperwork!

04:31.892 --> 04:34.024
It's time to launch
a bowling ball

04:34.024 --> 04:36.357
directly into my man-belly.

04:36.357 --> 04:37.358
Here we go!

04:40.110 --> 04:41.822
I didn't hear
the launch word.

04:41.822 --> 04:43.073
My bad.

04:43.073 --> 04:44.284
Launch word!

04:44.284 --> 04:45.616
Fire in the hole!

04:47.578 --> 04:48.869
Yes!

04:48.869 --> 04:51.792

04:53.624 --> 04:55.586
(quietly)
Aah!

04:55.586 --> 04:56.797
I don't remember ordering

04:56.797 --> 04:59.219
an infernal racket
 with my lunch.

04:59.219 --> 05:01.882
I am trying to enjoy
 my chimichangas.

05:03.474 --> 05:06.767
"Chimichangas."
That would have been
a good launch word.

05:06.767 --> 05:07.558
Fire in the hole!

05:08.889 --> 05:11.231
- Aah!
 -(glass shattering)

05:11.231 --> 05:13.934
This is bad, man.

05:13.934 --> 05:15.776
We just killed
the boss of Vuuugle.

05:15.776 --> 05:17.818
I'm not letting
you go like this,

05:17.818 --> 05:20.150
you big, beautiful,
English machine!

05:21.612 --> 05:24.705
Wow. This looks pretty bad...

05:24.705 --> 05:26.707
for you.

05:26.707 --> 05:29.410
You could get
in a lot of trouble for this.

05:29.410 --> 05:31.331
What are you gonna do?

05:31.331 --> 05:32.503
You.

05:32.503 --> 05:34.625
Hey, we're in this together.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.627
You fired the ball
that took him out.

05:36.627 --> 05:40.170
I think you mean
the ball that now has
your fingerprints all over it.

05:40.170 --> 05:42.723
I think you mean
the ball that has

05:42.723 --> 05:46.427
"Property of Bernie Schotz"
engraved next to these
tiny finger holes.

05:46.427 --> 05:49.349
I didn't even know they made
three-pound bowling balls.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.471
It's so light.

05:50.471 --> 05:52.853
Lighter balls are more
forgiving off the bumpers.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.435
I mean, doesn't matter.

05:55.566 --> 05:56.647
No one's ever

05:56.647 --> 05:59.069
gonna find out
about what we did.

05:59.069 --> 06:01.862
We're gonna
get rid of the body.

06:01.862 --> 06:06.987
(laughs evilly)

06:06.987 --> 06:09.249
If you're not joining
in the laugh, I'm gonna stop.

06:09.249 --> 06:10.621
It's awkward
with only one person.

06:13.584 --> 06:15.836
I'm telling you,
Becky doesn't exist.

06:15.836 --> 06:17.998
But why would Amelia
make up a person?

06:17.998 --> 06:19.880
Also, more sprinkles.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.802
She made Becky up

06:21.802 --> 06:24.675
because her Best Friend Tag
is missing a key ingredient:

06:24.675 --> 06:25.886
a best friend.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.889
Well, this hot chocolate's
missing a key ingredient:

06:28.889 --> 06:30.100
more sprinkles!

06:30.100 --> 06:31.722
-Yeah, girl!
-Yeah!

06:33.103 --> 06:35.646
Trust me, I'm right
about Amelia.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.728
I know all
about fake best friends.

06:37.728 --> 06:38.979
Story. Now.

06:38.979 --> 06:40.781
Also, whipped cream. Now.

06:42.072 --> 06:45.075
When I was seven,
I made up a best friend.

06:46.527 --> 06:47.908
Was her name Frankie Wong

06:47.908 --> 06:50.701
and that's how
I magically came to be?

06:50.701 --> 06:53.794
Her name was
Wendy Butterfly-Pants.

06:53.794 --> 06:55.876
Wendy Butterfly-Pants?

06:55.876 --> 06:57.998
I said I was seven!

06:57.998 --> 07:01.091
I had to lie about her
for an entire year.

07:01.091 --> 07:03.303
Once you dig yourself
into a fake best friend hole,

07:03.303 --> 07:04.595
it's hard to dig yourself out.

07:04.595 --> 07:07.678
So how'd you get rid of
this Wendy Butterfly-Pants?

07:07.678 --> 07:09.640
I told people
she was allergic to Earth

07:09.640 --> 07:10.851
and had to go live on Mars.

07:10.851 --> 07:13.223
-And they believed you?
-Everybody was seven!

07:14.645 --> 07:15.856
I don't get it.

07:15.856 --> 07:18.519
Why would someone
with over three million fans

07:18.519 --> 07:19.820
have to make up
a best friend?

07:19.820 --> 07:21.482
That's exactly why.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.323
Have you ever seen
Amelia with friends?

07:23.323 --> 07:24.985
She's always making videos.

07:24.985 --> 07:27.447
She has fans,
not friends.

07:29.119 --> 07:31.031
I have a crazy idea.

07:31.031 --> 07:33.874
Oh no, it's
your smiley thinky face.

07:33.874 --> 07:35.956
I'm gonna go
before you roll me into s--

07:35.956 --> 07:37.958
Let's do
the Best Friend Tag
with her!

07:37.958 --> 07:39.920
Agh!

07:39.920 --> 07:41.041
Do we have to?

07:41.041 --> 07:43.343
I mean, we're not even
totally sure Becky's fake.

07:43.343 --> 07:45.005
Becky canceled again.

07:45.005 --> 07:46.967
She's at bobsled practice.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.549
Here's a pic.

07:48.549 --> 07:50.851
She's the one in the back
who you can't see.

07:50.851 --> 07:52.933
Fine.

07:52.933 --> 07:56.306
Hey, Amelia, why don't we do
the Best Friend Tag with you?

07:56.306 --> 07:57.357
We can't do that.

07:57.357 --> 07:59.269
It's a best friend tag.

07:59.269 --> 08:01.441
I mean, yes, we're close.

08:01.441 --> 08:03.313
If someone asked me
who my favorite people

08:03.313 --> 08:07.658
at Vuuugle are, I'd say
Frankie Wong and Paige...

08:07.658 --> 08:09.700
Wong.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.912
Sure. Let's go with that.

08:12.953 --> 08:15.415
But a BFT has to be authentic,

08:15.415 --> 08:18.789
and it's not like we can
become best friends overnight.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.792
-Unless...
-(both gasp)

08:21.792 --> 08:24.585
-Sleepover!
-Paige changes
her last name to Wong!

08:24.585 --> 08:25.926
Oh.

08:25.926 --> 08:28.258
Okay, sleepover.

08:31.391 --> 08:32.842
Sleepover checklist.

08:32.842 --> 08:33.974
-Cheesy Doodles?
-Check.

08:33.974 --> 08:35.765
-Cheesy movies?
-Check.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.017
Anything else
with cheese in it?

08:37.017 --> 08:42.142
Only these ankle boots
designed by Antonio Marcheesmo!

08:43.193 --> 08:44.905
-Hey, Amelia!
-Come on in!

08:48.909 --> 08:50.611
That's a lot of stuff
for one night.

08:50.611 --> 08:51.992
Oh, it's not just for me.

08:51.992 --> 08:53.864
It's for all of us.

08:53.864 --> 08:54.955
I brought snacks.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.540
(bowl shatters)

09:00.540 --> 09:02.332
And I made sleepover schedules

09:02.332 --> 09:05.716
broken down into
15-minute increments.

09:05.716 --> 09:07.588
-Schedules?
-Increments?

09:07.588 --> 09:09.880
And most important...

09:12.012 --> 09:15.305
perfectly perfect pajamas!

09:16.516 --> 09:18.478
Both:
Yay.

09:24.645 --> 09:26.817
There. Your closet's organized.

09:26.817 --> 09:28.949
How fun was that?

09:28.949 --> 09:32.242
Half my wardrobe's
on the driveway.

09:32.242 --> 09:33.573
You're welcome.

09:33.573 --> 09:37.658
Up next, we can test out
my new DIY cleaning products.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.332
As much as we love cleaning,

09:42.332 --> 09:45.165
why don't we skip ahead
on the schedule?

09:45.165 --> 09:47.297
Ooh! Make up a dance routine.

09:47.297 --> 09:48.879
That actually sounds fun.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.050
That's a great idea!

09:50.050 --> 09:51.091
Oh! Sad robot!

09:51.091 --> 09:53.213
Both:
Boop, beep...

09:53.213 --> 09:56.176
(whines)

09:56.176 --> 09:58.809
That's the best
you can do?

09:58.809 --> 10:01.982
Uh, even sadder robot?

10:01.982 --> 10:04.985
Both:
Beep, boop...

10:04.985 --> 10:07.107
(whines louder)

10:07.107 --> 10:09.730
No, no, no,
I'll show you
how it's done.

10:09.730 --> 10:12.903
Becky and I do dance routines
at all of our sleepovers.

10:12.903 --> 10:16.947
Ah yes, Becky's moves
must be unreal.

10:16.947 --> 10:18.538
They are.

10:18.538 --> 10:21.121
We'll start off
with somethin' fun and easy.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.913
(dance music playing)

10:24.044 --> 10:25.625
You're killin' me, people.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.748
We'll do this
till we get it right.

10:27.748 --> 10:30.090
Shoulders back,
chin up, smiles bright,

10:30.090 --> 10:32.052
and a five,
six, seven, eight!

10:34.214 --> 10:37.597
Passé, battement.
Passé, battement.

10:37.597 --> 10:39.519
Whoo! Whoo!

10:39.519 --> 10:41.141
Kick the moon!
Kick the moon!

10:41.141 --> 10:42.763
Kick that moon
a little closer to me

10:42.763 --> 10:43.974
and I'll kick it
something good!

10:43.974 --> 10:45.686
(panting)

10:45.686 --> 10:49.109
Chattanooga!
Chattanooga! Chattanooga!

10:49.109 --> 10:51.772
Ankles breaking.
Ankles breaking.
Ankles breaking.

10:51.772 --> 10:54.775
Ring, ring.
Oh, who could this be?

10:54.775 --> 10:57.988
Why, it's Paige and Frankie
because they're phonin' it in!

10:57.988 --> 11:01.621
Chattanooga!
Chattanooga! Chattanooga!

11:03.704 --> 11:06.286
Okay, the quicker
we chop Liam up,

11:06.286 --> 11:08.208
the quicker we can
dispose of the body parts

11:08.208 --> 11:10.290
in various local rivers
and drainage ditches.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.133
(gags)

11:13.133 --> 11:14.795
I'm not feeling so good, Bern.

11:14.795 --> 11:16.797
I've never seen
a dead body before.

11:16.797 --> 11:18.298
It's not a real dead body.

11:18.298 --> 11:20.060
It's a machine.

11:20.060 --> 11:22.973
Okay, we can start
by sawing through Liam's neck,

11:22.973 --> 11:25.105
then we can move on
to chopping off his legs.

11:25.105 --> 11:26.937
(sputters)

11:26.937 --> 11:29.019
You can handle this, Dirk.

11:29.019 --> 11:30.310
You're tough. Okay.

11:32.612 --> 11:34.945
(screams)
He's still alive!

11:34.945 --> 11:36.156
It's just a glitch.

11:36.156 --> 11:37.367
He's a goner.

11:37.367 --> 11:39.029
Pay no attention to his eyes

11:39.029 --> 11:40.700
staring directly at you.

11:45.876 --> 11:47.037
Whoa!

11:47.037 --> 11:49.089
You sawed
right through his guts.

11:50.791 --> 11:52.042
Uh-oh!

11:52.042 --> 11:53.213
We've got a gusher!

11:53.213 --> 11:54.965
That makes two of us!

11:59.970 --> 12:01.972
(both groan)

12:01.972 --> 12:04.554
I think you girls have
earned yourselves a snack.

12:04.554 --> 12:07.187
Who's ready
for some delicious s'mores?

12:07.187 --> 12:09.019
Food! Starving!

12:09.019 --> 12:11.942
I make my own special s'mores.

12:11.942 --> 12:14.194
Instead of yucky melted
marshmallows and chocolate,

12:14.194 --> 12:17.447
I put soy cheese
in between two kale leaves...

12:17.447 --> 12:19.950
unmelted.

12:19.950 --> 12:23.824
Mmm. We're gonna need some
refreshing seaweed juice
to wash it down.

12:23.824 --> 12:25.625
Paige, can you show me
where the kitchen is

12:25.625 --> 12:27.247
even though
this is my house?

12:32.132 --> 12:34.134
Hurry up and eat
before she catches us!

12:34.134 --> 12:37.928
Mmm! Corn, cheese, and other
artificial ingredients.

12:37.928 --> 12:40.380
That's the stuff.

12:40.380 --> 12:43.763
I say we go back in there and
tell her we know Becky's fake
and end this whole thing.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.595
No! You can't expose
a fake best friend.

12:45.595 --> 12:47.187
It would crush her.

12:47.187 --> 12:48.648
Come on,
we can do this.

12:48.648 --> 12:49.769
It's not so bad.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.232
I'm sitting on a toilet
eating Cheesy Doodles

12:52.232 --> 12:54.314
while wearing Amelia's face.

12:54.314 --> 12:56.446
This is the lowest moment
of the night.

12:56.446 --> 12:57.858
And my life.

12:59.199 --> 13:00.570
-Are you done?
-Yes.

13:00.570 --> 13:02.572
Good. Now shove those
in my mouth!

13:02.572 --> 13:04.074
We don't have a lot of time!

13:10.170 --> 13:13.253
Okay, we just need
to get to the dumpster

13:13.253 --> 13:14.334
without looking suspicious.

13:14.334 --> 13:16.336
-Yeah, okay.
-No one has to know

13:16.336 --> 13:17.757
we've got Liam
in this rug.

13:18.758 --> 13:20.380
Uh-oh. It's the two dudes

13:20.380 --> 13:22.132
from the Two Dudes
With a Metal Detector channel.

13:22.132 --> 13:24.764
Nothing to see here, boys!

13:24.764 --> 13:26.056
Look! Dimes!

13:26.056 --> 13:27.517
(metal detectors beep)

13:28.929 --> 13:30.100
Those were pennies.

13:31.271 --> 13:33.313
I see what's going on here.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.104
(gasps)

13:34.104 --> 13:36.146
You're obviously fans
of my channel:

13:36.146 --> 13:39.149
Talking Rugs
with Rug Doug.

13:39.149 --> 13:40.240
Seriously?

13:40.240 --> 13:42.242
Can anything be
a channel at this place?

13:43.994 --> 13:47.207
Oh my, is that a Persian carpet
from the Safavid era?

13:47.207 --> 13:48.328
Uh-huh.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.750
-It's a that from then.
-(gasps)

13:50.750 --> 13:52.212
-Please unroll it.
-No!

13:52.212 --> 13:54.664
-We can't!
-I must see it
in all its splendor!

13:54.664 --> 13:57.167
-No!
-Dirk did it!

13:58.508 --> 14:00.460
This is obviously a fake.

14:00.460 --> 14:03.013
Thanks for wasting my time.

14:05.305 --> 14:06.226
I thought you put Liam in here.

14:06.226 --> 14:07.767
I thought you did!

14:07.767 --> 14:10.060
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

14:18.148 --> 14:20.400
Oh, my-- New curtains!

14:20.400 --> 14:22.192
A pink shag rug?

14:22.192 --> 14:23.193
(gasps)

14:23.193 --> 14:25.115
You gave my yeti a makeover?

14:27.577 --> 14:31.831
I understand if you never speak
to me again, Dennis.

14:31.831 --> 14:34.494
Frankie! The Wall of Memories!

14:34.494 --> 14:35.755
It's gone!

14:36.997 --> 14:38.048
What'd you do?

14:38.048 --> 14:40.630
I tested out my new
DIY cleaning products.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.923
They worked, obvi'.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.505
Didn't you even read
what was on that wall?

14:45.505 --> 14:49.309
Well, I didn't want
to overstep my boundaries.

14:49.309 --> 14:51.681
That wall was our lives.

14:51.681 --> 14:54.064
It had three years worth
of inside jokes

14:54.064 --> 14:55.855
and special moments
from our friendship,

14:55.855 --> 14:59.149
-and you ruined it.
-Just like you ruined
this sleepover.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.981
Oh.

15:00.981 --> 15:02.822
Well, if that's the case,

15:02.822 --> 15:05.575
I think we can skip to
the conclusion of our schedule:

15:05.575 --> 15:07.907
Amelia leaves
with her dignity.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.969
Hey, Dirk.
Have you seen Amelia?

15:28.969 --> 15:32.352
Liam? No. Why?
What have you heard?

15:32.352 --> 15:34.264
Uh, nothing.

15:34.264 --> 15:35.725
We're just looking for Amelia.

15:35.725 --> 15:36.977
We kind of had
a rough night.

15:36.977 --> 15:41.321
At least your soul isn't heavy
with the sins of your past.

15:42.522 --> 15:44.154
-What?
-What?

15:46.826 --> 15:48.698
-Do we even want to--
-No.

15:49.909 --> 15:53.493
Girls, I'm really sorry
I erased your Wall of Memories.

15:53.493 --> 15:56.286
Wow. Thanks, Amelia.

15:56.286 --> 15:58.038
I know if Becky
and I had a memory wall

15:58.038 --> 16:00.540
and someone erased it,
I'd be devastated,

16:00.540 --> 16:02.462
especially considering
Becky and I have

16:02.462 --> 16:04.464
so many more memories
than you two.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.965
Okay, I can't do this anymore.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.967
Amelia, we know the truth.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.219
There is no Becky.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.850
Amelia?

16:10.850 --> 16:12.182
Becky?

16:12.182 --> 16:13.223
Both:
Becky?

16:13.223 --> 16:14.394
(Amelia and Becky scream)

16:16.356 --> 16:19.149
Both: Chattanooga!
Chattanooga! Chattanooga!

16:19.149 --> 16:20.310
(both scream)

16:20.310 --> 16:22.312
Is this really happening?

16:22.312 --> 16:25.815
I'm so happy
to see you, A-me-me-pie!

16:25.815 --> 16:27.407
"A-me-me-pie"?

16:27.407 --> 16:29.159
Hi! I'm Becky Megan.

16:29.159 --> 16:30.370
But you can call me Becky.

16:30.370 --> 16:32.322
Or Megan.

16:32.322 --> 16:34.324
"A-me-me-pie"?

16:34.324 --> 16:37.917
Are you ready to make
the best Best Friend Tag ever?

16:37.917 --> 16:39.829
Wait! I need to grab my things!

16:42.292 --> 16:44.544
Both:
Uh...

16:44.544 --> 16:47.387
I'm sorry, what were
we talking about?

16:47.387 --> 16:50.300
Oh, right,
Becky's not real.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.511
Please, continue.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.093
We're sorry
we doubted you.

16:53.093 --> 16:54.514
We just thought that--

16:54.514 --> 16:56.015
I had to make up
a best friend?

16:56.015 --> 16:57.227
No, no, no, no, no.

16:57.227 --> 16:58.938
Well, yeah.

17:00.310 --> 17:01.441
We thought there was no Becky

17:01.441 --> 17:03.273
and we didn't want
to embarrass you.

17:03.273 --> 17:07.277
Oh, right, because
being called a liar
isn't embarrassing at all.

17:09.909 --> 17:12.412
Becky, I thought
you were staying one night.

17:12.412 --> 17:15.535
I am, but this is all
they would let me bring
on the plane.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.497
All right, we'll just have
to work with what you've got.

17:18.958 --> 17:19.959
(both scream)

17:23.542 --> 17:26.586
♪ Hey! Hey! ♪

17:28.338 --> 17:30.670
-(garbage truck humming)
-And there goes the dumpster.

17:30.670 --> 17:33.973
Wow, we're actually
gonna get away with this.

17:33.973 --> 17:35.595
I don't know, Bern.

17:35.595 --> 17:37.347
I've got a bad feeling
in my stomach.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.519
Not here where
the bowling ball hit me,

17:39.519 --> 17:40.940
but here.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.184
I think we did
a really bad thing last night.

17:44.184 --> 17:46.236
That's not how
I remember it.

17:46.236 --> 17:48.898
Pretty sure I was hanging out
with my friend John last night.

17:48.898 --> 17:51.571
-Oh look,
he left me a voice mail.
-(phone beeps)

17:51.571 --> 17:55.905
Bernie's voice:
 Hey, Bernie. This is
 your buddy, John, uh, Alibi.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.539
Just wanted to confirm
 you and I were together

17:59.539 --> 18:01.161
lifting weights last night.

18:01.161 --> 18:03.503
A normal night
 where nothing happened

18:03.503 --> 18:05.585
except for you
 benching two-fiddy.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.507
You are yolked, brah!

18:09.339 --> 18:11.090
I have to confess.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.882
Maybe the judge
will go easy on me.

18:12.882 --> 18:14.924
Guys like me
don't do well in prison.

18:14.924 --> 18:16.806
You know, 'cause I like
to post videos

18:16.806 --> 18:18.598
and the Wi-Fi
is not good.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.100
Dirk, no!
You can't confess.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.642
I've worked too hard for this.

18:22.642 --> 18:25.605
The DareMeBro code
is very clear

18:25.605 --> 18:27.147
on its stance
toward robot murder.

18:27.147 --> 18:30.400
It's only allowed
after all peaceful avenues

18:30.400 --> 18:31.861
have been explored.

18:33.493 --> 18:35.365
I've got some serious
thinking to do.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.578
(ominous music plays)

18:38.578 --> 18:43.663
Looks like it might be
a gettin'-rid-of-two-bodies
kind of day.

18:46.506 --> 18:47.707
(laughing)

18:49.128 --> 18:50.550
Hey, guys.

18:50.550 --> 18:52.752
Amelia? What are you doing here?

18:52.752 --> 18:54.804
I had somethin'
I needed to fix.

18:54.804 --> 18:57.387
If your face
is on my sheets,

18:57.387 --> 18:59.259
-I swear I will--
-Frankie!

18:59.259 --> 19:01.561
The Wall of Memories.

19:01.561 --> 19:02.932
It's back.

19:02.932 --> 19:05.395
It's exactly the same
as it was.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.476
How'd you do that?

19:06.476 --> 19:08.438
I took 400 selfies
at our sleepover

19:08.438 --> 19:10.480
and the wall
was in the background.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.732
But my smile was
always in the foreground.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.576
Why would you do this for us
after what we said to you?

19:17.657 --> 19:19.539
Becky and I tried
to do a Best Friend Tag,

19:19.539 --> 19:21.491
but it was a disaster.

19:21.491 --> 19:23.663
We haven't seen
each other in so long,

19:23.663 --> 19:26.416
we barely know anything
about each other anymore.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.378
Then I read
what was on your memory wall

19:28.378 --> 19:30.590
and I realized...

19:30.590 --> 19:33.793
I want a friendship
like you guys have.

19:33.793 --> 19:38.558
But now, I don't even know
if I have any friends at all.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.602
-Amelia, we're--
-You're right!

19:42.602 --> 19:44.564
I have two friends right here!

19:48.648 --> 19:51.611
Hey, Amelia, do you, uh,
want to do another sleepover?

19:51.611 --> 19:52.692
Tonight?

19:52.692 --> 19:54.314
But I don't have any pajamas.

19:54.314 --> 19:56.276
I haven't choreographed
any dance routines.

19:56.276 --> 19:59.699
I think we can take care
of both of those things.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.661
Beep, beep, beep...

20:01.661 --> 20:02.912
(small whimper)

20:02.912 --> 20:05.124
Aw, you call that
a sad robot?

20:05.124 --> 20:06.626
Show me sadder!

20:06.626 --> 20:11.040
Sad-anooga!
Sad-anooga! Sad-anooga!

20:11.040 --> 20:13.293
Beep, beep, beep...

20:13.293 --> 20:14.504
(whimpers louder)

20:19.799 --> 20:21.891
Hey, big guy.

20:21.891 --> 20:23.763
I know you've been
having a hard time,

20:23.763 --> 20:26.726
so I built you
this sleep chamber
to help you get rest

20:26.726 --> 20:29.018
and put this whole
Liam thing behind you.

20:29.018 --> 20:31.230
Wow. Thanks, Bern-man.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.152
I don't know what I'd do
without a friend like you.

20:36.065 --> 20:38.318
I also set up
some soothing sounds

20:38.318 --> 20:40.490
of waves crashing
and ship horns,

20:40.490 --> 20:42.782
so expect to hear those.

20:44.123 --> 20:45.575
Hello, boys.

20:45.575 --> 20:46.786
(screaming)

20:46.786 --> 20:49.168
Ghost Liam!
Please don't eat me!

20:49.168 --> 20:50.330
Good luck, buddy!

20:54.674 --> 20:57.136
I know what happened
 yesterday...

20:57.136 --> 20:59.719
I am so sorry.

20:59.719 --> 21:01.260
...up until I came in
 to see you and Bernie,

21:01.260 --> 21:03.763
and then my screen
 suddenly went black,
 and I have no idea why.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.345
Huh?

21:05.345 --> 21:06.766
I mean, what?

21:06.766 --> 21:08.097
I mean, huh?

21:09.389 --> 21:11.811
The IT guys said it would take
 a few hours to fix,

21:11.811 --> 21:13.062
so I took the rest
 of the day off.

21:13.062 --> 21:15.945
I ate scones by a pond
 and I met a duck!

21:17.357 --> 21:19.489
It was the best day
 of my life.

21:19.489 --> 21:22.532
And for some reason,
 they upgraded my robot.

21:22.532 --> 21:23.703
Do you have any idea why?

21:23.703 --> 21:27.787
Uh... 'cause you're
more handsome now?

21:27.787 --> 21:30.039
Ah, I like you, Dirk!

21:30.039 --> 21:32.712
Let me buy you a hot chocolate.

21:32.712 --> 21:34.874
Okay.

21:34.874 --> 21:36.716
Here we... go?

21:36.716 --> 21:38.007
Indeed!

21:43.132 --> 21:45.635
(muffled rock music playing)

21:45.635 --> 21:47.477
Bernie: Hey!
What's happening?

21:47.477 --> 21:48.808
There's someone in here!

21:48.808 --> 21:50.690
Dude! Dude! Dude!

21:52.352 --> 21:53.893
(phone dials, line rings)

21:53.893 --> 21:56.986
Grandma, I'm in a box.

21:56.986 --> 21:58.438
Again.

21:58.438 --> 22:00.940
Can you pick me up
at the docks?

22:03.783 --> 22:06.366
Okay, Amelia,
 what's my favorite--

22:06.366 --> 22:07.827
Tie-dye,
 ripped jeans,

22:07.827 --> 22:10.079
ironic T-shirts,
 and old sneakers.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.251
Those are
 her favorite clothes...

22:12.251 --> 22:15.585
(quietly)
 that she should
 never wear again.

22:15.585 --> 22:16.956
I can hear you.

22:16.956 --> 22:18.167
Yeah, I'm not doing this.

22:20.259 --> 22:23.463
First question
for our Best Friend Tag.

22:23.463 --> 22:25.805
What's the worst thing
I've ever done?

22:25.805 --> 22:28.307
This one time,
 you shot a bowling ball--

22:28.307 --> 22:29.639
What did I say?

22:29.639 --> 22:31.350
We take that to our grave!

22:32.305 --> 22:38.866
