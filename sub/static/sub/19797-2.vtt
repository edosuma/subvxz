00:37.901 --> 00:39.634
Hello!

00:39.701 --> 00:41.334
-You all right? -Yeah, good, thanks.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.734
Oh. See that film last night?

00:44.801 --> 00:46.300
-Denzel Washington? -No.

00:46.367 --> 00:49.100
Aw, he's brilliant. He's a brilliant actor.

00:49.167 --> 00:51.434
I know, he's very good. Very good.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.167
-Aw, dear. -I like him.

00:53.234 --> 00:54.634
He's got it.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.734
(SIGHS) See you later.

00:57.801 --> 00:59.334
Yeah. See you later.

01:03.167 --> 01:06.133
Listen, he's not my favourite actor of all time, by the way.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.634
-Oh, no? -No.

01:07.701 --> 01:11.033
My favourite actor of all time is Mr Sidney Poitier.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.667
-Oh. -So, that's all right?

01:15.734 --> 01:17.901
Yes. That's amazing.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.367
Gareth, what... Are you building up your wrists?

01:28.434 --> 01:29.601
Yes.

01:29.667 --> 01:31.000
Oh.

01:31.067 --> 01:33.567
When is the charity wank-athon?

01:35.234 --> 01:36.767
I don't know, but you'd win it.

01:36.834 --> 01:38.400
(CHUCKLES) That's good.

01:38.467 --> 01:40.300
-Good. -No, seriously, what are you doing?

01:40.367 --> 01:42.367
Orienteering, aren't I, with the TAs.

01:44.167 --> 01:45.234
All right.

01:47.701 --> 01:51.000
Uh, yeah. Just come to, um... Come to apologise.

01:51.067 --> 01:53.033
Oh, mate, don't worry about it.

01:53.100 --> 01:55.634
Look, I was out of order. I'd had a bad time, was really wound up, so...

01:55.701 --> 01:57.067
-No, I understand, mate. -I shouldn't have done it.

01:57.133 --> 01:58.367
Well, I'm...

01:59.901 --> 02:01.133
So we're cool, yeah?

02:01.200 --> 02:03.267
Yeah. Absolutely, yeah. Totally cool.

02:03.334 --> 02:06.000
What's that? Is that for me?

02:06.067 --> 02:08.400
-Yeah. -Ah, cheers. Thanks.

02:08.467 --> 02:11.901
Just to put your mind at rest. There's nothing going on between 'em.

02:11.968 --> 02:14.400
'Cause I would know, I've been watching him like a hawk.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.567
And I imagine you've been watching her at your end.

02:16.634 --> 02:19.033
So between us we've got it covered.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.934
All right, yeah. See you later, mate, yeah?

02:26.000 --> 02:29.100
Yeah. All right. Thanks for that, mate. Cheers.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.567
Probably a bottle of something.

02:35.634 --> 02:37.334
You reckon?

02:37.400 --> 02:38.667
Look at the shape.

02:43.267 --> 02:47.300
Today I'm doing our staff appraisals.

02:47.367 --> 02:49.767
And some people can get a little bit nervous about that,

02:49.834 --> 02:52.000
'cause they think they're walking the long mile

02:52.067 --> 02:54.100
to put their head on the block, which is wrong.

02:54.167 --> 02:57.133
They fill out a form in advance

02:57.200 --> 03:01.100
and they don't only sort of list their strengths and weaknesses,

03:01.167 --> 03:03.267
um, but also mine as a boss.

03:03.334 --> 03:08.234
So it's a chance for them to tell me where we're going wrong.

03:08.300 --> 03:11.000
And we can, you know... It's very much an opportunity...

03:11.067 --> 03:12.801
To separate the wheat from the chaff.

03:12.868 --> 03:16.200
No. That sounds bad. It's not a witch-hunt.

03:16.267 --> 03:18.300
We're not trying to find out who the worst people are.

03:18.367 --> 03:19.734
Mmm. Well, we know who they are already.

03:19.801 --> 03:21.968
-Well, no... -I've written them on my form.

03:22.033 --> 03:23.968
You shouldn't have written it on your form, um...

03:24.033 --> 03:25.100
I've underlined the worst ones.

03:25.167 --> 03:27.267
You're missing the point. Yeah.

03:31.334 --> 03:33.968
-Hello, David. -Here he is.

03:34.033 --> 03:37.167
Tim Canterbury. A good man. The Canterbury Tales.

03:38.133 --> 03:40.601
-Of Chaucer. -Yup.

03:40.667 --> 03:42.234
And Shakespeare.

03:45.868 --> 03:47.701
-Pleased with you. Very proud. -Thank you.

03:47.767 --> 03:49.434
New leaf, etcetera.

03:49.500 --> 03:53.834
Trust, encouragement, reward, loyalty, satisfaction.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.667
That's what I'm, you know...

03:55.734 --> 03:58.767
Probably wondering why I am so generous with encouragement?

04:00.601 --> 04:03.234
Trust people and they'll be true to you.

04:03.300 --> 04:06.334
Treat them greatly and they will show themselves to be great.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.334
That's...

04:09.634 --> 04:11.901
So happier now? No looking back?

04:11.968 --> 04:14.133
Well, I am still eventually going to go back to uni

04:14.200 --> 04:15.601
and do a psychology degree, but, yeah...

04:15.667 --> 04:18.067
No point. No point. No point. No point.

04:18.133 --> 04:21.601
Sure, 18-19, go to university, get it out of your system.

04:21.667 --> 04:24.968
Waste time mucking around, getting drunk, getting up at midday.

04:25.033 --> 04:27.133
-Having casual sex. -Having casual sex, you know.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.667
But we're in our 30s now.

04:28.734 --> 04:31.467
Well, I'm only just 30. Are you... You must be 39?

04:31.534 --> 04:35.167
No. Both in our 30s is the fact. Yeah?

04:37.267 --> 04:40.934
And who's to say, you know, you keep your head down,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.100
in a few years time you could be in the hot seat,

04:44.767 --> 04:46.968
like me, so...

04:47.033 --> 04:50.367
-When I'm nearly 40. -Well, we're both in our 30s at the moment is what I'm...

04:50.434 --> 04:52.434
Just chewing the fat. You know, but...

04:53.534 --> 04:55.534
Good. You're on the right lines.

04:55.601 --> 04:57.634
Can I just...

04:57.701 --> 05:01.367
-If we're facing in the right direction... -Mmm?

05:01.434 --> 05:04.033
...all we have to do is keep on walking.

05:06.334 --> 05:09.133
Yeah. Very nice. You're quite a philosopher.

05:09.200 --> 05:13.701
Well, it's just that I think our greatest glory

05:13.767 --> 05:17.300
is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.

05:17.367 --> 05:18.701
-Are you reading these? -Am I what?

05:18.767 --> 05:19.801
Reading the quotes.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.467
Confucius. Oh, Bernard Shaw...

05:24.534 --> 05:28.133
It doesn't matter who said them first. I'm passing on my wisdom.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.634
-Don't tell those I've just been reading these. -I'm not gonna.

05:31.701 --> 05:34.267
It's an insult. I'll put it down there if it's obvious.

05:38.067 --> 05:40.801
I always wanted to be a children's illustrator.

05:40.868 --> 05:43.467
And when people said to me, "What do you do?" I would say,

05:43.534 --> 05:47.300
"Well, I'm an illustrator, but I do some reception work for a bit of extra cash."

05:47.367 --> 05:51.534
And for years I was an illustrator who did some reception work.

05:51.601 --> 05:56.133
And then Lee thought it would be a good idea for us to both get full-time jobs.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.601
And, you know, then you're knackered after work

05:58.667 --> 06:02.901
and it's hard to fit in time with the illustrating. You know, so...

06:02.968 --> 06:06.567
Now, when people say, "What do you do?" I say, "I'm a receptionist."

06:10.234 --> 06:12.167
And a bloody good one, you know.

06:12.234 --> 06:13.801
And you'll always have the art.

06:13.868 --> 06:17.067
Keep up... Keep up the doodling always.

06:17.133 --> 06:19.534
Pipe dreams are good in a way.

06:19.601 --> 06:21.834
Well, I still hope it will happen, to be honest.

06:21.901 --> 06:26.467
Keep the dream alive because otherwise one day you'll go, "Oh! Could I have made it?"

06:26.534 --> 06:28.734
Yeah.

06:28.801 --> 06:31.133
And if you keep trying, at least then, when it, when it doesn't happen,

06:31.200 --> 06:33.133
you can go, "At least I gave it a go."

06:33.200 --> 06:34.200
You know?

06:41.133 --> 06:43.267
Are you settling in all right? Yeah. I think it's...

06:43.334 --> 06:44.834
Having fun?

06:44.901 --> 06:46.868
Uh, yeah.

06:46.934 --> 06:49.868
Not much fun. Not as much fun as you can have at Wernham Hogg.

06:50.968 --> 06:52.133
How long were you at Swindon?

06:52.200 --> 06:53.868
Uh, two years.

06:53.934 --> 06:56.567
-Right. -Two years.

06:56.634 --> 07:00.500
Okay, if you had to name a role model,

07:00.567 --> 07:02.567
someone who's influenced you, who would it be?

07:02.634 --> 07:04.400
What, like a historical person?

07:04.467 --> 07:06.400
No, someone in sort of general life.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.334
Just someone who's been an influence on you.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.500
I suppose my mum. She's just... She's strong,

07:13.434 --> 07:15.834
calm in the face of adversity.

07:15.901 --> 07:19.167
(SIGHS) God, I remember when she had a hysterectomy...

07:19.234 --> 07:21.701
If it wasn't your mother, though...

07:21.767 --> 07:24.534
It doesn't even have to be a woman. It could be a...

07:24.601 --> 07:26.701
Man? Um, okay.

07:26.767 --> 07:29.968
Well, I suppose if it was a man it'd be my father.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.901
Not your father. Let's take your parents as read.

07:32.968 --> 07:36.200
I'm looking for someone in the work-related arena

07:36.267 --> 07:37.400
-who's influenced... -Right. Okay.

07:37.467 --> 07:40.267
Well, I suppose Tim, then. He's always...

07:40.334 --> 07:42.567
Well, he's a friend, isn't he? Not a friend.

07:42.634 --> 07:45.167
Someone in authority. Maybe I didn't... You know...

07:45.234 --> 07:46.801
Well, then, I suppose Jennifer.

07:46.868 --> 07:50.601
I thought we said not a woman. Didn't we? Or am I...

07:50.667 --> 07:54.500
Er, okay, well, I suppose you're the only one who...

07:54.567 --> 07:57.000
Oh.

07:57.067 --> 08:02.033
Embarrassing. It's backfired, isn't it? Oh, dear. Very flattering.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.567
-Can we put me as a... -Okay. Tim, then.

08:04.634 --> 08:06.734
We said not Tim. So, do you want to put me or not?

08:06.801 --> 08:08.167
-Okay. -Right.

08:08.234 --> 08:09.534
So shall I put strong role model?

08:09.601 --> 08:10.567
-Okay. -Yeah.

08:16.634 --> 08:18.167
(ALARM RINGS)

08:23.500 --> 08:27.100
Just a drill. Just a... Do not panic. Okay?

08:27.167 --> 08:28.801
GARETH: Come on, people, let's get moving.

08:28.868 --> 08:31.868
-They're trained. Good man. -Just as if it was real.

08:31.934 --> 08:34.934
-I'd be the last one out in these situations. -Do not run and do not panic.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.167
Not that this is in my job description. That's just what I do.

08:37.234 --> 08:38.234
Leave your personal possessions. Come on.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.901
I do this every couple of months.

08:39.968 --> 08:43.000
Not that we have to by law. But that's not what I do.

08:43.067 --> 08:47.000
It's because even though I'm always cool in a situation like this,

08:47.067 --> 08:48.634
some people are not.

08:48.701 --> 08:51.601
And so, I try to make sure... I'll do that. It's all right.

08:51.667 --> 08:54.367
-No, no, no, no. I've got it. Go! -We were...

08:57.534 --> 08:59.734
I'm going to get you out of here, all right?

09:03.968 --> 09:05.367
(ALARM CONTINUES RINGING)

09:10.767 --> 09:14.701
Obviously the lifts are out of bounds in a fire situation,

09:14.767 --> 09:18.167
so the important thing is... Put her down.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.334
(SIGHING)

09:21.667 --> 09:23.567
This isn't worth it. It's stupid.

09:23.634 --> 09:25.634
Obviously, in a real situation we'd take her all the way down,

09:25.701 --> 09:27.834
but this is just a drill, so we can leave her here.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.400
-Can't I just use the lift? -No, not even in a drill. Never use the lift.

09:31.467 --> 09:33.734
We'll be out, maybe one minute. We'll be back.

09:46.901 --> 09:48.133
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

09:55.234 --> 09:57.834
I've got no problem at all with him visiting every single child in the world

09:57.901 --> 09:59.601
on a single night.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.234
What I can't believe is that he's gonna stand up there

10:01.300 --> 10:02.801
in Barnardo's arguing with old women.

10:02.868 --> 10:05.400
(LAUGHING)

10:05.467 --> 10:09.801
I don't know if you're aware of the situation that's arising here.

10:09.868 --> 10:11.834
I usually steer clear of ladies at work,

10:11.901 --> 10:14.834
but there is someone I've got my eye on.

10:14.901 --> 10:19.100
I won't say who. I don't know what Tim's playing at, moving in.

10:19.167 --> 10:21.767
He's already embarrassed himself once before asking Dawn out,

10:21.834 --> 10:24.400
so this is only going to end in tears.

10:24.467 --> 10:28.434
Whereas I, you probably notice, play it cool.

10:28.500 --> 10:32.500
He's not a man of the world like me.

10:32.567 --> 10:36.234
I can read women. And you've got to know their wants and their needs.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.934
And that can be anything from

10:38.133 --> 10:41.500
making sure she's got enough money to buy groceries each week,

10:41.567 --> 10:45.767
to making sure she's gratified sexually after intercourse.

10:47.334 --> 10:49.434
(ALARM CONTINUES RINGING)

10:51.767 --> 10:53.534
(ALL CHATTING)

11:05.634 --> 11:08.834
Noticed you were using all your best lines on Rachel.

11:08.901 --> 11:11.300
-(LAUGHING) Best lines? I was just being friendly. -Yeah.

11:11.367 --> 11:15.601
Hmm. It was friendly, sort of, more than.

11:15.667 --> 11:17.467
-More than? -Friendly.

11:22.534 --> 11:27.467
Under "Strengths," you've just put "Accounts".

11:27.534 --> 11:28.634
Yeah.

11:31.567 --> 11:35.234
-That's your job, though. That's just... that's just... -Mmm.

11:35.300 --> 11:39.601
No, Keith. I'm sort of looking for your skills within your job.

11:39.667 --> 11:42.100
So, is there anything else you could've put there?

11:45.767 --> 11:47.667
-No. -Okay. Um...

11:49.300 --> 11:51.601
Under "Weaknesses" you've put "Eczema".

11:56.500 --> 11:59.033
You had a fantastically welcoming buffet.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.167
(LAUGHING)

12:00.234 --> 12:02.267
-The wine was something else. -Hmm.

12:02.334 --> 12:05.067
-Everyone's sort of quite friendly. -Yeah, everyone's...

12:05.133 --> 12:06.801
And Tim... Tim seems nice.

12:06.868 --> 12:10.200
Yeah. He's a good laugh.

12:10.267 --> 12:14.534
I've just got to, um... Has he got a girlfriend, or...?

12:14.601 --> 12:17.868
-Tim? No. -Why? What's up with the...

12:17.934 --> 12:19.868
Oh, nothing. Why, why?

12:21.300 --> 12:23.334
Would you? Hmm?

12:23.400 --> 12:25.534
Um, out of the equation.

12:25.601 --> 12:28.500
Yeah. I know, but if you weren't, would he be...

12:28.567 --> 12:31.500
If I weren't? (SNORTS) Madness.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.868
Keith.

12:35.934 --> 12:38.567
You've left this section completely blank, Keith.

12:38.634 --> 12:40.500
You haven't done the Q and A.

12:40.567 --> 12:42.334
I thought that you filled that in.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.200
No, no, no, no. This is aimed at you.

12:45.267 --> 12:49.100
"To what extent do you believe that you have the skills and knowledge

12:49.167 --> 12:50.767
"to perform your job effectively?"

12:50.834 --> 12:52.667
And then, you just tick one of the boxes.

12:52.734 --> 12:56.267
"Not at all. To some extent. Very much so. Don't know."

12:56.334 --> 12:57.734
What would you tick?

12:59.734 --> 13:00.601
Don't know.

13:01.434 --> 13:02.534
Okay.

13:03.734 --> 13:06.033
Um, question two.

13:06.100 --> 13:10.834
"Do you feel you have received adequate training to use your computer effectively?"

13:16.000 --> 13:17.601
What are the options?

13:17.667 --> 13:20.000
Same as... They're always the same. Always the same.

13:20.067 --> 13:23.634
"Not at all. To some extent. Very much so. Don't know."

13:23.701 --> 13:26.167
-Don't know. -Don't know again. Okay.

13:28.534 --> 13:31.334
"Do you feel you are given the flexibility to decide

13:31.400 --> 13:33.868
"how best to accomplish your goals?"

13:38.500 --> 13:39.968
-Do you want the options again? -Yeah.

13:40.033 --> 13:43.801
"Not at all. To some extent..." Always the same.

13:43.868 --> 13:45.767
-"Very much so. Don't know." -Don't know.

13:45.834 --> 13:49.000
If "Don't know" wasn't there, what would you put?

13:54.667 --> 13:57.767
-What are the options? -"Not at all. To some extent.

13:57.834 --> 14:00.467
-"Very much so. Don't know." -Very much so.

14:00.534 --> 14:02.000
-Do you remember what the question was? -No.

14:02.067 --> 14:04.400
Okay. "Do you..." Let's...

14:04.467 --> 14:06.200
We're going to leave that there.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.734
Just going to give the new Swindon lot a bit of a...

14:14.801 --> 14:17.834
I mean, it's not an appraisal as such, but, you know...

14:17.901 --> 14:21.300
(ALL LAUGHING)

14:21.367 --> 14:23.434
Sorry. Just showing them...

14:23.500 --> 14:27.367
Keep them occupied for the main event.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.767
I hope you warmed 'em up better than last time!

14:29.834 --> 14:31.267
Doesn't look like it.

14:33.067 --> 14:35.734
-Okay. See you later. -EMPLOYEES: See you. Bye.

14:37.267 --> 14:40.100
Anyway, good. Um, hello.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.434
Uh, obviously, I can't give you an appraisal as such.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.334
You've only been here a week.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.467
But I did want to try and get a flavour of how you're settling in.

14:49.534 --> 14:52.500
Um, I know it's probably not the same vibe you're used to.

14:52.567 --> 14:55.934
Neil ruled with a bit more of an iron fist than me.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.067
But, uh, settling in? Having a good time?

15:02.868 --> 15:03.868
How is it different?

15:05.934 --> 15:07.300
More laid back, presumably.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.334
Think it's more laid back?

15:11.400 --> 15:13.467
-Yeah? Yes? -Yeah...

15:13.534 --> 15:17.667
Say yes, then, if you think it's more laid back. More laid back, more fun.

15:17.734 --> 15:19.067
-Well... -Huh?

15:19.133 --> 15:20.200
-Nothing. -Go on.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.500
We're actually used to doing stuff,

15:24.567 --> 15:28.234
like working hard, being motivated.

15:28.300 --> 15:30.000
There's not much dynamism out there, is there?

15:30.067 --> 15:32.767
No, I mean, people look like they're getting away with murder.

15:32.834 --> 15:34.367
Having a laugh, yes.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.234
Well, I think quite a few of us are bored.

15:38.133 --> 15:41.434
Oh. What, you preferred Swindon?

15:41.500 --> 15:43.934
-More of a laugh. -You're having a laugh saying that.

15:45.667 --> 15:48.567
What's so good about Swindon? Neil?

15:48.634 --> 15:50.901
-Yeah, for one. -What, you preferred Neil to me?

15:54.200 --> 15:57.167
Who thinks Neil's more of a laugh than me? Hands up.

15:57.234 --> 15:59.801
So... That's mental!

15:59.868 --> 16:02.901
Come off it. You...

16:03.100 --> 16:06.300
We're gonna have a drink. Come out for a drink with me and see who's more of a laugh.

16:06.367 --> 16:07.834
Put your money where your mouth is...

16:07.901 --> 16:09.767
We'll go for... We'll go for a drink at lunchtime.

16:09.834 --> 16:11.100
We'll go... Right.

16:13.968 --> 16:15.534
Right. Here we are.

16:15.601 --> 16:18.000
Mike, there's an outing, okay? Lunchtime.

16:18.067 --> 16:20.500
Show that lot what Slough lot are like, yeah?

16:20.567 --> 16:22.367
Keith, what are you doing lunchtime?

16:29.634 --> 16:31.767
Welcome to Alcoholics Anonymous!

16:31.834 --> 16:33.801
No. Purely social.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.968
I know someone who is an alcoholic and it's no laughing matter.

16:37.033 --> 16:38.968
Particularly for his wife, so...

16:39.033 --> 16:42.500
And she's got alopecia, so not a happy home life.

16:42.567 --> 16:44.934
And their eldest is like that Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man.

16:45.133 --> 16:50.667
So, that's probably what turned him to it in the first place.

16:50.734 --> 16:52.367
So, looking forward to the weekend?

16:53.934 --> 16:55.701
-Yeah. -Cheers.

16:55.767 --> 16:57.467
Cheers.

16:57.534 --> 17:00.801
Mmm. That's a lovely drop of ale. That's Courage.

17:00.868 --> 17:02.567
See, you get a lot of that round here

17:02.634 --> 17:06.400
'cause the main brewery's in Reading, so... They do it

17:06.467 --> 17:10.100
all over. They do it in London and everything, so...

17:10.167 --> 17:14.100
What's the, um, brewery in Swindon? Is there a big...

17:15.500 --> 17:16.934
It might be Courage actually.

17:17.133 --> 17:18.367
Don't know.

17:18.434 --> 17:21.300
No. This is all right, though, innit?

17:23.133 --> 17:25.067
Nice pub... Ah?

17:25.133 --> 17:28.100
No. Just a private joke.

17:28.167 --> 17:32.434
I was saying, this is nice. There's a lovely pub near me, the Gardener's Arms.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.868
-(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) -What? What are you doing?

17:34.934 --> 17:38.167
Oh. It's just a bloke over there looks like someone we know.

17:38.234 --> 17:40.968
Okay. One at a time. Focus, yeah?

17:41.033 --> 17:43.901
You'll get more out of it in the long run, I promise you that.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.300
Um...

17:50.067 --> 17:51.267
I forgot what I was saying, then.

17:51.334 --> 17:53.534
That's what happens when you...

17:54.801 --> 17:56.133
Courage.

17:57.801 --> 18:00.734
-Three points. -What? Don't do that on my head.

18:00.801 --> 18:03.901
-Yeah. Unless you've changed into a dart... -From past experience,

18:03.968 --> 18:06.334
-the dartboard being there makes no difference to you. -Listen!

18:06.400 --> 18:09.701
I could be here and I'll still get 180.

18:09.767 --> 18:11.567
-Ooh! -Hiya.

18:11.634 --> 18:13.968
-Phew. Phew. Straight. -You all right?

18:14.033 --> 18:17.801
Um, a couple of mates of mine are going down to Yates', um...

18:17.868 --> 18:20.734
-The wine lodge? Classy. Joking. -(RACHEL CHUCKLES)

18:20.801 --> 18:24.601
Well, I was wondering if you'd like to come down with us or not.

18:24.667 --> 18:27.067
And you, Dawn. You could bring Lee if you like.

18:27.133 --> 18:28.500
Oh. I don't think we'll be able...

18:28.567 --> 18:30.767
Okay, but, um, you can come?

18:32.367 --> 18:34.133
Yeah, yeah, I'll be coming. Thanks.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.934
Great. Okay, um...

18:36.000 --> 18:39.033
-You meant tonight? Yeah. Brilliant. -Yeah. Just after work.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.067
TIM: Yeah, all right. We'll have a couple of drinks, yeah.

18:41.133 --> 18:43.267
-RACHEL: Cool. Okay. -Excellent.

18:43.334 --> 18:46.601
-Good luck. See you in a bit, all right. -Um, later.

18:48.067 --> 18:49.834
-That'll be fun. -Yeah.

18:49.901 --> 18:52.100
Yes. Yeah.

18:52.167 --> 18:54.801
It'll be cool. Cool as a cucumber.

Hmm. No, I've eaten here, so...

It's been a washout, ain't it?

You know, I don't know why I bothered if no one else is going to make the effort.

19:48.133 --> 19:50.000
-We have made the effort. -Huh?

19:50.067 --> 19:52.400
We have made the effort.

19:52.467 --> 19:55.200
Yeah. I'm not having a go at you. It's just...

19:55.267 --> 19:57.901
Obviously the best people haven't turned up. Let's just...

Um, I'm confused. I don't know what just happened there.

21:04.167 --> 21:06.434
But obviously you've got a problem with something. What is it?

I've been trying to deal with this situation delicately

21:31.334 --> 21:34.133
and I'm now your boss, but that's the deal, live with it.

Watch your back. Slagging you off.

22:29.567 --> 22:31.234
-What? -Slagging you off, yeah.

22:31.300 --> 22:32.868

22:37.767 --> 22:40.801
Just going, "Oh, you lot are rubbish."

I was going, "Our lot are rubbish? Your Swindon lot are shit."

22:45.033 --> 22:47.334

22:47.400 --> 22:49.167
Did you hit him?

If I had, don't you think he'd have come through that wall?

22:58.534 --> 23:00.734
Just like slagging you lot off.

I went, "Your Swindon lot are little slugs.

"Little slugs with no personality.

24:14.534 --> 24:16.367
-All right? -Thanks.

24:16.434 --> 24:19.267
That's... That's good to know I have something to fall back on.

24:19.334 --> 24:22.634
What if I do go all the way with Tim but I want a little bit more with you?

24:24.667 --> 24:27.567
I don't usually do sloppy seconds,

24:27.634 --> 24:29.567
but I judge everything on its individual merit,

24:29.634 --> 24:32.567
so we'll cross that river when we come to it.

24:33.567 --> 24:35.534
Thanks. That's good to know.

24:35.601 --> 24:36.934
No problem.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.067
(SIGHS)

24:41.133 --> 24:45.367
-One in the kettle? -Yeah. It's actually just boiled, so...

24:45.434 --> 24:48.133
One moment. If you do go all the way with Tim

24:48.200 --> 24:54.000
and you expect me to go in there afterwards, make sure he wears a condom.

24:54.067 --> 24:55.667
All right? It's sort of a rule.

24:59.567 --> 25:01.734
-Is there any milk? -Yeah. It's in the fridge.

25:14.100 --> 25:15.634
-See ya. -See you later, mate.

25:20.334 --> 25:21.634
-You going home? -Yeah.

25:28.434 --> 25:29.567
DAWN: That's for you.

25:29.634 --> 25:31.000
Cheers.

25:31.067 --> 25:34.234
Um, oh, can you call Millson's

25:34.300 --> 25:40.400
and get that credit breakdown faxed over or emailed or whatever?

25:40.467 --> 25:42.100
-Sure. -And, uh,

25:42.167 --> 25:46.634
do you mind typing up those appraisal contracts ASAP?

25:46.701 --> 25:47.868
I want to get them back to them.

25:47.934 --> 25:50.734
-Sure. Okay. See you Monday. -See you.

25:50.801 --> 25:52.968
Dawn, I'm fed up.

25:53.033 --> 25:55.734
I'm fed up, to be honest. It's just, I...

25:55.801 --> 25:57.267
-Oh! Why? -This place.

25:57.334 --> 25:59.067
I don't want to say anything, but this...

25:59.133 --> 26:01.601
Sometimes, I think it's a right shithole.

26:01.667 --> 26:02.868
-Do you? -Yeah.

26:07.267 --> 26:09.167
Do you think I'm funny?

26:10.767 --> 26:12.467
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

26:12.534 --> 26:15.267
Do you think Neil's funny? Sit down.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.601
-Do I think Neil's funny? -Yeah.

26:18.667 --> 26:21.434
Um, you know, I don't really know him, David.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.334
But he's not funnier than me?

26:23.400 --> 26:25.367
(SIGHS) No. Definitely not.

26:25.434 --> 26:29.334
Right. I wish you'd tell that to the Swindon lot, miserable bunch of...

26:29.400 --> 26:31.534
-Aren't they? Some of them? Boring. -Mmm.

26:32.534 --> 26:33.567
Mmm.

26:35.367 --> 26:38.434
What's your favourite stuff that I do, comedy-wise?

26:38.500 --> 26:44.000
Um. Oh, there's too much.

26:44.067 --> 26:46.601
-The impressions? -Oh! Yeah.

26:46.667 --> 26:47.601
Which ones?

26:47.667 --> 26:49.634
Uh...

26:49.701 --> 26:52.634
Oh! Which ones are there again?

26:52.701 --> 26:55.434
-Kermit? -Kermit. Brilliant.

26:55.500 --> 26:59.367
"Welcome to The Muppet Show." "Hai-ya, Frog!"

26:59.434 --> 27:03.601
Miss Piggy. Do you know Kermit's nephew, Robin?

27:03.667 --> 27:08.133
# Halfway up the stair is the stair where I sit #

27:08.200 --> 27:10.334
-Do you do Gonzo? -No.

27:10.400 --> 27:12.400
Do you want a beer?

27:12.467 --> 27:14.434
Um, I can't go to the pub.

27:14.500 --> 27:17.767
No, no, no. I've got some here ready.

27:18.934 --> 27:20.234
For emergencies.

27:27.901 --> 27:29.634
Cheers. Oh!

27:34.400 --> 27:36.701
I was looking through

27:39.467 --> 27:41.234
some old poems I used to do.

27:41.300 --> 27:43.334
-Oh? Did you? I didn't know. -Yeah.

27:43.400 --> 27:46.100
-Yeah. What sort of... -Big time.

27:46.167 --> 27:49.767
Quite sort of powerful. Here's one.

27:49.834 --> 27:53.334
Shall I read one to you? This one's called Excalibur.

27:56.334 --> 27:59.234
"I froze your tears and made a dagger

27:59.300 --> 28:02.033
"and stabbed it in my cock forever.

28:02.100 --> 28:04.234
"It stays there like Excalibur.

28:04.300 --> 28:06.334
"Are you my Arthur? Say you are."

28:06.400 --> 28:07.500
Good.

28:07.567 --> 28:10.100
"Take this cool, dark, steeled blade.

28:10.167 --> 28:12.701
"Steal it, sheath it in your lake.

28:13.734 --> 28:16.200
"I'd drown with you to be together.

28:16.267 --> 28:18.868
"Must you breathe? 'Cause I need heaven."

28:24.234 --> 28:27.701
-Um. It's powerful. -Very.

28:27.767 --> 28:29.400
And double meanings. Did you get the double meanings?

28:29.467 --> 28:30.567
I did.

28:32.734 --> 28:34.500

28:51.300 --> 28:54.601
# So what becomes of you, my love

28:56.934 --> 29:01.634
# When they have finally stripped you of

29:01.701 --> 29:04.067
# The handbags and the gladrags
