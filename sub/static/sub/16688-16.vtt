WEBVTT

00:10.040 --> 00:11.620
( All screaming )

00:11.720 --> 00:14.300
Quiet, everyone!
Muscle Man, status report!

00:14.400 --> 00:17.620
Okay, okay!
We're out of range!

00:17.720 --> 00:19.720
I can't believe
what just happened!

00:19.120 --> 00:22.020
Sureshot, Rawls!
Do you think they're...

00:22.120 --> 00:23.700
Let's not think about that
now.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.780
I...
I'm sure they're fine.

00:25.880 --> 00:27.820
But what's the deal
with that AntiâPops guy?

00:27.920 --> 00:29.140
Why is he out to get us?!

00:29.240 --> 00:31.260
Not <i>usââ Pops!</i>

00:31.360 --> 00:33.100
I don't know
why he'd be after me.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.220
Does he think
I owe him money or something?

00:35.320 --> 00:38.320
( Makes "I don't know" hum )
We've got our coordinates ââ

00:37.520 --> 00:39.520
we should keep going
on our mission.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.020
Full systems check!

00:40.120 --> 00:42.100
Dome integrity at 100%!

00:42.200 --> 00:43.500
No damage to engines!

00:43.600 --> 00:45.620
Power systems and shields
at full capacity.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.860
Whoa, seriously?
We didn't get hit at all?

00:47.960 --> 00:49.660
Wait a sec...

00:49.760 --> 00:52.760
It actually looks like there's
one place we sustained damage.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.240
My bed!
How did this happen?

00:59.160 --> 01:03.100
( Laser pinging )

01:03.200 --> 01:05.200
( Toilet flushes )

01:09.080 --> 01:10.980
I guess we'll never know.

01:11.080 --> 01:12.900
Ugh, I need a new bed.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.340
You know, I need one, too.

01:14.440 --> 01:16.260
I never had a bed
at the park!

01:16.360 --> 01:18.460
My bed
turned into a computer.

01:18.560 --> 01:22.180
Ugh! As if it wasn't enough for
them to blow up the Space Tree

01:22.280 --> 01:24.420
and chase us
halfway into the next sector,

01:24.520 --> 01:26.460
most of us don't even
have a place to sleep!

01:26.560 --> 01:30.860
Before we continue our mission,
we're gonna get new beds.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.660
Eileen, plot a course
to the closest bed store!

01:33.760 --> 01:36.620
Uh, I'm not 100% sure
how to do that.

01:36.720 --> 01:40.580
Eileen, figure out how to plot a
course to the closest bed store!

01:42.720 --> 01:46.260
Whoa! This is the biggest UMAK
I've ever seen!

01:46.360 --> 01:48.460
I can't wait to have
some of their meatballs.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.740
Okay, you guys guard the dome
while we're gone.

01:50.840 --> 01:53.060
All right,
Captain Benson, bro!

01:53.160 --> 01:54.620
Maggie?

01:54.720 --> 01:58.780
Maggie?!
Has anybody seen my girlfriend?!

01:58.880 --> 02:00.940
Now stick together.
We don't want to get lost

02:01.040 --> 02:02.580
Howdy, folks!
( All scream )

02:02.680 --> 02:05.500
Welcome to UMAK's
intergalactic flagship ââ

02:05.600 --> 02:10.420
your source for modern furniture
that's not only inexpensive,

02:10.520 --> 02:12.060
it's durable, too!

02:12.160 --> 02:14.420
Both: ( Chuckling )
Wooden butt.

02:14.520 --> 02:15.740
( Chuckling )

02:15.840 --> 02:18.140
And make sure
you check out our cafe

02:18.240 --> 02:20.940
and have one of
our famous meatball subs.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.300
It's meat!

02:23.400 --> 02:24.820
What's the question mark
for?

02:24.920 --> 02:27.560
Never mind that!
Here's a map!

02:30.320 --> 02:32.940
There ââ beds ââ sector 1â15âZ.
Is that far?

02:33.040 --> 02:35.860
Yes! Now,
you better get moving!

02:49.720 --> 02:52.600
( Upbeat synthâpop playing )

03:11.000 --> 03:13.380
Rigby, there's no way
I'm buying that bed!

03:13.480 --> 03:18.140
Aw, come on! It's the thrill
you've always wanted in a bed!

03:18.240 --> 03:21.880
Hmm.
I'm not sure about this one.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.020
This one's cheap.
I'll take it!

03:29.120 --> 03:30.420
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:30.520 --> 03:32.520
Don't just buy
the first bed you see!

03:32.080 --> 03:33.820
You gotta sleep on it
every night.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.180
This is one thing
you don't skimp on!

03:36.280 --> 03:39.180
You know what,
you're right!

03:39.280 --> 03:40.380
I'll take the full!

03:40.480 --> 03:43.220
Uh, excuse me,
we're ready to check out.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.180
( Sighs )
Then go to the checkout.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.740
What?

03:46.840 --> 03:48.840
You take the card
with your bed's item number

03:48.440 --> 03:49.820
down to the warehouse,

03:49.920 --> 03:51.540
and that's
where you get your beds.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.140
Where's the warehouse?

03:53.240 --> 03:56.660
So, ya know, all the way
back where you came in?
Yeah.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.580
Further than that.
( All groan )

03:58.680 --> 04:01.380
Hey! You know
what I could use right now?

04:01.480 --> 04:03.700
Some meatballs!

04:03.800 --> 04:07.380
Pops: It does feel good
to rest a bit.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.820
We shouldn't be out in the open
this long!

04:09.920 --> 04:11.860
This was supposed to be
a quick mission!

04:11.960 --> 04:13.960
What if there's somebody
after us?

04:13.200 --> 04:15.100
Oh, lighten up, Benson.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.460
( Munching )

04:16.560 --> 04:18.560
Mmm! Mmm! Nice.
Oh, yeah. Real good.

04:21.640 --> 04:22.940
Ugh!

04:23.040 --> 04:26.260
It's only two space creds ââ
what do ya expect?!

04:26.360 --> 04:28.140
Enough with the meatballs
already!

04:28.240 --> 04:30.240
Let's get those beds!

04:33.600 --> 04:36.940
( Munching )

04:37.040 --> 04:38.660
Ma'am, you need to
bus your tray.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.760
Bus this!

04:43.040 --> 04:44.820
Come on!
I don't make the rules!

04:55.320 --> 04:57.260
I think someone
is following us!

04:57.360 --> 04:58.740
Really?

04:58.840 --> 05:00.620
Eileen: Eh, it's just
a really ugly chair.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.980
Let's keep moving.
Phew!

05:03.080 --> 05:06.060
Hey, have you seen
a girl named Maggie around here?

05:06.160 --> 05:07.940
Shh!

05:08.040 --> 05:10.820
You see, I went to the bathroom
a couple months ago, andââ

05:10.920 --> 05:12.540
( Screams )
( All gasp )

05:12.640 --> 05:14.140
Pops,
you're coming with me!

05:14.240 --> 05:16.460
What?!
Run!

05:16.560 --> 05:18.820
( All panting )

05:25.080 --> 05:27.080
( Growls )

05:29.080 --> 05:31.080
( Panting )

05:33.680 --> 05:35.820
Man, who buys
this stuff?!

05:35.920 --> 05:38.660
Benson: Who cares?!
Come on!

05:38.760 --> 05:42.780
You can't run forever!
( Laughs )

05:42.880 --> 05:44.900
Aagh! A dead end!
What are we gonna do?!

05:45.000 --> 05:48.780
Oh, man, the bounty I'm gonna
collect after catching you guys

05:48.880 --> 05:51.740
is gonna be
as big as this big furniture.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.100
( Screams )
We're trapped!

05:53.200 --> 05:54.700
Glomb: Get in!

05:54.800 --> 05:56.920
What?!
I said get in!

05:59.840 --> 06:01.740
Don't worry,
you're safe now.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.020
Who are you?
Show yourself!

06:04.120 --> 06:06.220
I am the armoire
you're hiding in.

06:06.320 --> 06:08.340
My name is Glomb.

06:08.440 --> 06:09.700
What's going on?

06:09.800 --> 06:12.020
( Gasps )
I can't believe my drawers!

06:12.120 --> 06:15.100
It is you ââ
the chosen one.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.580
It's an honor.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.260
The chosen one?
But I'm Pops.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.740
Heh!
What an unusual name.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.180
Yeah, whatever you say,
Glomb.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.620
Who are you, anyways?

06:25.720 --> 06:29.420
I'm one of many operatives
stationed throughout the galaxy

06:29.520 --> 06:33.780
sworn to protect
the chosen onââ er, Pops.

06:33.880 --> 06:37.460
The galaxy?
They all know who I am?

06:37.560 --> 06:38.660
Of course!

06:38.760 --> 06:40.860
The resistance exists
solely to aid you

06:40.960 --> 06:43.900
in your quest to defeat
He Who Will Erase Us.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.660
AntiâPops.
AntiâPops? Oh, yes!

06:47.760 --> 06:49.140
( Chuckles )
I get it.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.020
How do we know
we can trust you?

06:51.120 --> 06:53.740
And why do you think our Pops
is the "Chosen One"?

06:53.840 --> 06:57.100
I recognized him
from the sacred mark I bear ââ

06:57.200 --> 06:59.740
the symbol
of the resistance.

06:59.840 --> 07:04.300
A tattoo of me? Oh, my!
So permanent.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.980
And it hurt like heck ââ
which will go the same for you

07:07.080 --> 07:08.820
if that bounty hunter
catches you

07:08.920 --> 07:11.260
and delivers you to
He Who Will Eraseââ

07:11.360 --> 07:13.620
AntiâPops.
Yes, exactly!

07:13.720 --> 07:16.540
It's imperative we get you out
of here as soon as possible!

07:16.640 --> 07:19.140
Here! Behind me
is a shortcut to the exit.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.820
( Grunts )

07:21.920 --> 07:24.020
Sorry, it gets stuck
sometimes.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.860
I'm very cheaply made.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.900
Go! Go quickly!

07:29.000 --> 07:30.540
I...

07:30.640 --> 07:34.140
I don't know what to say but,
thank you very much!

07:34.240 --> 07:35.620
The honor was mine.

07:35.720 --> 07:38.020
Now, fly! Fly, you fool!

07:41.320 --> 07:42.820
We're almost to the exit!
Come on!

07:42.920 --> 07:44.940
Wait!

07:45.040 --> 07:47.260
We're not leaving
without those beds.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.240
( Rock music plays )

07:52.440 --> 07:54.440
( Grunts )

07:58.160 --> 08:00.940
Okay, last one,
then we're out of here.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.460
( Straining )

08:02.560 --> 08:04.020
( Grunting )

08:04.120 --> 08:07.700
Why'd you have to get
a metal bed, Pops, hmm?

08:07.800 --> 08:09.580
I heard
it's good for your back.

08:09.680 --> 08:12.580
( All gasp )
You should've left
when you had the chance.

08:12.680 --> 08:16.260
I know.
Well, now you don't have to
worry about it.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.380
Because
even without those beds,

08:18.480 --> 08:21.500
I'll make sure
you get a good night's sleep.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.060
Oopsy daisy!

08:23.160 --> 08:25.340
Looks like we've been getting
some complaints

08:25.440 --> 08:28.860
from our employees ââ what
with you shooting 'em and all.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.180
Run for it!

08:31.280 --> 08:33.180
Hey!

08:33.280 --> 08:35.060
See what I mean?

08:35.160 --> 08:37.940
Quick!
Into the clearance section!

08:40.120 --> 08:42.700
Everybody, split up!

08:51.160 --> 08:52.740
( Gasps )

08:52.840 --> 08:54.980
Just give me Pops
and this'll all be over!

08:55.080 --> 08:56.740
Never!

08:56.840 --> 08:58.660
( Grunts )

08:58.760 --> 09:00.760
Uhâoh.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.960
( Grunts )

09:09.120 --> 09:11.260
Pops, can you use your powers
to try and stop her?

09:11.360 --> 09:13.300
( Groans )

09:13.400 --> 09:14.540
It's not working!

09:14.640 --> 09:16.980
Never mind!
Just keep running, Pops!

09:17.080 --> 09:19.340
You might be the only one
who can defeat AntiâPops!

09:19.440 --> 09:20.740
We'll try to hold her off!

09:20.840 --> 09:22.420
I'm not running!

09:22.520 --> 09:25.560
If all my friends are fighting,
I'm fighting, too!

09:28.760 --> 09:30.540
( Screams )
Oh!

09:30.640 --> 09:31.460
( Gasps )

09:31.560 --> 09:33.060
Get ready.
( Grunts )

09:40.040 --> 09:42.040
( Grunts )

09:43.360 --> 09:46.820
Rigby, watch out!

09:46.920 --> 09:50.420
Let me out of here!

09:50.520 --> 09:51.700
( Whirring )

09:51.800 --> 09:53.800
No!
( Grunts )

09:59.040 --> 10:00.300
So how was the store?

10:00.400 --> 10:02.400
We got chased by a bounty hunter
and almost died.

10:02.320 --> 10:03.740
How was it here?
Oh, wow!

10:03.840 --> 10:05.840
Me and Muscle Man
were gonna eat burritos,

10:05.680 --> 10:07.140
and we thought
there was only one.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.240
But turns out there was
a second one hiding underneath,

10:08.960 --> 10:10.500
so it all worked out.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.860
That was a close call, guys.
Glad we got out of there.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.660
Yeah, for <i>now!</i>

10:15.760 --> 10:17.760
How many more bounty hunters
are on the lookout for Pops?

10:17.640 --> 10:19.340
It doesn't matter!

10:19.440 --> 10:21.440
As long as we're working
together and we got
each other's backs,

10:20.800 --> 10:22.300
I think we'll be fine.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.400
Yeah, like how Muscle Man and I
worked together

10:24.320 --> 10:26.320
to fix that thing
with our burritos!

10:25.960 --> 10:27.220
Yeah, that's
sort of the idea!

10:27.320 --> 10:28.820
Great!

10:28.920 --> 10:31.940
Now, does anybody know
how to assemble these beds?

10:32.040 --> 10:33.700
All: Uh...

10:47.640 --> 10:50.440
( Laughing )
