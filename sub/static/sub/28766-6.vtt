00:06.796 --> 00:08.671
Was he paid to be at her birthday? Hey, was there no other solution?

00:13.213 --> 00:17.588
A therapist, a retreat,
something nice to stroke like a jumper?

00:18.046 --> 00:19.838
A stripper, a hamster, I don't know!

00:20.463 --> 00:23.255
-You're crazy.
-Go back to stroking your blogger, then!

00:23.338 --> 00:25.546
Watch out, jealousy is a couple thing.

00:26.296 --> 00:29.421
-Don't tell the others or I'll...
-Or what? You'll leave me?

00:30.005 --> 00:32.588
Tricky. We're not together,
so you can't leave me.

00:32.671 --> 00:34.213
-Shut up.
-It's true!

00:34.296 --> 00:35.880
-Were we together...
-Shut up!

00:36.921 --> 00:39.546
-So, you're never going to tell Elsa?
-See you!

00:40.046 --> 00:42.505
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:42.588 --> 00:44.546
THE LAME PLAN

00:44.630 --> 00:46.296
THE CRAZY PLAN

00:46.380 --> 00:48.921
THE BOOTY PLAN

00:49.005 --> 00:50.880
THE HOOK-UP PLAN

00:51.505 --> 00:54.463
You don't have his address?
Any other way of contacting him?

00:54.546 --> 00:57.005
-No email, no Snapchat, no Skype?
-Nothing.

00:57.296 --> 00:59.046
If he hasn't replied yet, that's it.

01:00.005 --> 01:01.588
I mean... honestly.

01:01.671 --> 01:04.713
Nowadays, who can be phoneless
for more than an hour? An Amish?

01:05.296 --> 01:08.713
What's weird is the empty contact list
and the deleted texts.

01:08.796 --> 01:11.046
-It's really weird.
-A friendless Amish.

01:11.963 --> 01:13.796
-Or a terrorist.
-Do you think so?

01:14.338 --> 01:16.796
-Or he wants to dump you.
-Still no news?

01:18.046 --> 01:19.296
Honestly, forget it.

01:19.963 --> 01:20.963
-You OK?
-Yes.

01:29.046 --> 01:31.880
You'd say if you'd told him
something at the party, right?

01:35.671 --> 01:36.671
Speak of the devil. Is it him?

01:41.130 --> 01:42.171
Is it him or not?

01:43.755 --> 01:44.755
Shit...

01:45.588 --> 01:46.963
AnaÃ¯s just showed up.

01:53.421 --> 01:54.713
My little sister!

01:57.713 --> 01:58.921
-Hey...
-Hi!

02:00.463 --> 02:01.463
My dumpling!

02:02.130 --> 02:05.088
I'm passing through for work.
I'm in Paris for the afternoon.

02:05.171 --> 02:08.630
-Oh, right...
-I couldn't miss the birthday girl!

02:08.713 --> 02:09.713
No.

02:11.296 --> 02:14.171
I've just told your mom.
I think I woke her.

02:14.588 --> 02:15.796
BIZET HOSPITAL

02:30.046 --> 02:30.880
Pretty.

02:33.505 --> 02:34.713
Thanks. You too.

02:35.880 --> 02:36.880
Emilie, right?

02:39.421 --> 02:40.796
What's going on between you?

02:43.713 --> 02:44.713
I don't know.

02:45.213 --> 02:46.046
You?

02:47.546 --> 02:49.380
From what I read, you know everything.

02:55.421 --> 02:57.505
I almost got married, aged 20.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.421
My boyfriend at the time said no.

03:01.505 --> 03:02.505
At the altar.

03:03.671 --> 03:05.755
He couldn't have told you,
he doesn't know.

03:06.588 --> 03:07.588
I'm sorry.

03:08.380 --> 03:12.546
What's crazy is that, 12 years later,
I'm scared it will happen again.

03:16.755 --> 03:17.796
Nothing happened.

03:20.713 --> 03:22.130
Is he unhappy with me?

03:25.046 --> 03:27.921
You should ask him, don't you think?

03:39.380 --> 03:43.005
-At least the party didn't destroy you.
-I'm a machine.

03:43.838 --> 03:46.338
You'll never be ready,
the marathon is in two weeks.

03:46.421 --> 03:47.713
Don't worry about me.

03:47.796 --> 03:50.588
He's seen Elsa's new man,
he wants to get back into shape.

03:50.671 --> 03:53.255
Totally unrelated. Why do you say that?

03:53.338 --> 03:55.505
-Jules is pretty ripped.
-Ripped?

03:55.921 --> 03:59.380
Nonsense! Have you seen him?
He's a shrimp. Did you see his calves?

03:59.463 --> 04:02.880
-He boxes so I reckon--
-You reckon what?

04:03.380 --> 04:04.630
Go get my water.

04:05.505 --> 04:08.213
Come on, dammit!
So sluggish! I need more energy!

04:08.296 --> 04:10.671
Matt had sex all night
and he's operational.

04:10.755 --> 04:11.880
I didn't have sex.

04:20.171 --> 04:22.255
By the way, Jules is a really nice guy.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.588
Show-off, douchebag,
shitty sense of humor.

04:26.046 --> 04:28.005
Are you kidding me? He's a sweetheart.

04:28.380 --> 04:31.505
-He has it all. He's a teacher...
-Good for him.

04:31.588 --> 04:33.421
It's about sacrificing yourself.

04:33.505 --> 04:35.755
Sacrificing your salary on shoes,
more like. Max, don't fuck this up.

04:38.630 --> 04:39.463
What?

04:40.380 --> 04:42.588
-Are you doing your lap or what?
-I'm going!

04:45.838 --> 04:47.088
Look at this, Anita.

04:48.255 --> 04:49.255
Relax.

04:50.796 --> 04:52.838
Amazing! It looks so real!

04:53.380 --> 04:55.755
-Whoa!
-Isn't it great, Anita?

04:56.713 --> 04:59.213
A getaway in Lisbon
without leaving Paris.

04:59.296 --> 05:00.546
Is that luxury or what?

05:01.338 --> 05:02.671
And the final touch...

05:03.338 --> 05:04.171
Click.

05:19.005 --> 05:20.255
Thinking about Elsa?

05:23.588 --> 05:25.671
Remember who you started this job for?

05:27.671 --> 05:28.671
This amazing woman.

05:30.380 --> 05:32.380
Bide your time, OK?

05:33.046 --> 05:36.296
Keep saving for her old age,
then you can play it romantic.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.463
Faster! You lost two seconds.
You're sluggish!

05:42.880 --> 05:43.921
But he gained three.

05:44.755 --> 05:46.796
-Keep him on his toes.
-Yeah.

05:47.130 --> 05:50.755
-Is there something going on with Jules?
-No, I don't think so.

05:51.088 --> 05:54.963
"Sweetheart, teacher, self-sacrifice."
My sister gave me the same spiel.

05:55.046 --> 05:56.796
-Did she brief you?
-No.

05:57.130 --> 05:58.713
She's done something stupid.

05:58.796 --> 06:00.421
-I don't know.
-You're lying.

06:01.130 --> 06:04.463
That's ugly, man, after ten years.
Is there anything I should know?

06:04.546 --> 06:07.505
No. I don't know.
There's nothing you should know. Really.

06:08.255 --> 06:09.755
OK, I believe you.

06:10.588 --> 06:13.130
If you want to know anything,
just go and see Jules.

06:13.755 --> 06:16.630
-So there <i>is</i> something I should know?
-No, there isn't.

06:17.088 --> 06:19.546
But if I wanted to know something,
I would ask him.

06:21.088 --> 06:23.796
-Why would I ask him if there's nothing?
-Oh, please!

06:23.880 --> 06:25.963
I'm kicking his ass
with his stupid calves!

06:26.463 --> 06:27.463
You're losing time!

06:28.088 --> 06:29.380
OK, I'll go and see him.

06:30.213 --> 06:32.046
Enough with the memories for now.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.630
I need to move forward.

06:41.588 --> 06:42.880
What's wrong, Mom?

06:45.630 --> 06:47.338
I have to leave the apartment.

06:47.796 --> 06:48.963
What do you mean?

06:49.046 --> 06:51.171
I didn't want to bother you again but...

06:52.255 --> 06:55.380
They've been nice,
my contract ended two months ago.

06:58.296 --> 07:01.463
-New caretaker in three months.
-In three months?

07:01.546 --> 07:04.463
They can't kick you out like this,
where will you go?

07:06.546 --> 07:07.546
I don't know. Fuck...

07:18.546 --> 07:20.171
-Thanks, Daddy.
-I'm tired.

07:24.046 --> 07:25.880
-I forgot!
-What?

07:28.463 --> 07:30.796
Well, yeah. And a little one for Mom too.

07:31.296 --> 07:35.588
-I couldn't resist the duty-free.
-We'd said no extravagance!

07:35.671 --> 07:37.755
Oh, honey, that's so sweet.

07:40.130 --> 07:41.505
You shouldn't have.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.671
It's beautiful. See that, Elsa?

07:44.755 --> 07:45.963
For fuck's sake, Mom.

07:46.046 --> 07:48.213
Right. I need a cigarette.

07:50.130 --> 07:51.963
-She smokes now.
-She fucks, too.

08:00.796 --> 08:01.796
Wow...

08:03.963 --> 08:06.213
This makes a change from Eminem posters.

08:08.838 --> 08:09.838
So...

08:10.296 --> 08:13.130
How's City Hall? Not too much of a pain?

08:13.213 --> 08:14.671
-No...
-Not too much sun?

08:21.880 --> 08:23.005
And with your man?

08:25.963 --> 08:28.630
I don't know, you're dolled up,
you're answering back.

08:29.296 --> 08:30.463
There must be a reason.

08:33.880 --> 08:34.880
Well...

08:36.171 --> 08:38.130
-Tell me.
-I don't know.

08:38.213 --> 08:39.630
-What?
-I don't know...

08:40.380 --> 08:42.713
-He forgot his phone at my party.
-Yeah...

08:42.796 --> 08:46.255
It was my only way
of contacting him so it sucks.

08:46.338 --> 08:48.296
-Yeah, that sucks.
-Totally.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.880
There must be a way of finding him.

08:53.921 --> 08:55.046
You could have called.

08:56.630 --> 08:58.796
I'm 6,000 miles away,
always between flights.

08:59.630 --> 09:02.130
You know me and jetlag,
I don't know what day it is.

09:03.046 --> 09:05.963
-Well, I'm between Mom and Dad.
-Ouch.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.046
Now that's jetlag.

09:10.338 --> 09:12.130
Singapore is cool but...

09:13.921 --> 09:15.255
I miss Paris a bit.

09:18.213 --> 09:19.213
And... your sister?

09:23.713 --> 09:25.005
What about my sister?

09:26.463 --> 09:27.838
Do you miss her a bit too?

09:30.880 --> 09:32.838
If she's asking, I don't say it enough.

09:34.588 --> 09:36.338
Are you mad I left, my dumpling?

09:37.213 --> 09:38.588
No, it's just...

09:39.046 --> 09:42.130
We don't have the same idea
of travel, that's all.

09:48.005 --> 09:50.755
-And stop calling me your dumpling!
-What?

09:50.838 --> 09:53.880
I'm not a dumpling anymore.
I "undumpling'ed" recently.

09:54.171 --> 09:55.296
I can see that.

09:56.046 --> 09:57.088
You're beautiful.

09:59.588 --> 10:02.588
Right. Is there no way we can find
your man's address?

10:03.421 --> 10:04.713
I don't know...

10:05.463 --> 10:07.296
Did he bring anyone to the party?

10:08.713 --> 10:09.713
Yes.

10:10.255 --> 10:11.380
Yes, he did!

10:27.921 --> 10:31.880
"Roman Karic, Julio Saldenha.
Back of courtyard."

10:46.796 --> 10:48.088
Sorry, am I disturbing you?

10:48.171 --> 10:49.296
No, not at all.

10:49.380 --> 10:51.838
I was preparing a lesson.
I'm the Latin Bunny.

10:52.505 --> 10:55.796
The kids love it, they go crazy.
Did Jules tell you to come over?

10:55.880 --> 10:57.755
-No.
-He's not here.

10:57.838 --> 10:59.255
He's left for the evening.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.255
And how did you find out...

11:01.963 --> 11:04.005
-Good old Chantal.
-What?

11:04.088 --> 11:07.546
Chantal.
You shared an Uber with her last night.

11:07.630 --> 11:09.713
-Yes.
-And she dropped you off.

11:12.671 --> 11:13.671
Julio Saldenha.

11:14.838 --> 11:17.963
No, Julio was my previous roommate.
He was great.

11:18.046 --> 11:20.505
But the real Jules Dupont, yours,

11:20.588 --> 11:22.963
he gets his mail sent to his mom, Anita.

11:26.796 --> 11:27.921
Anita...

11:29.130 --> 11:31.130
-Anita Dupont?
-Not at all.

11:32.380 --> 11:34.796
Yes. Yes, of course, Jules Dupont.

11:35.171 --> 11:38.380
So, yeah, Anita Dupont, obviously.

11:41.046 --> 11:43.546
Could you give him this? It's...

11:44.421 --> 11:45.421
his phone.

11:45.838 --> 11:48.421
So he can call me -
I haven't heard from him.

11:49.338 --> 11:51.046
Cool. Great.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.380
OK.

11:55.921 --> 11:57.713
-See you. <i>TschÃ¼ss!</i>
<i>-TschÃ¼ss!</i>

12:13.546 --> 12:16.005
Boxing. Every Sunday, 5 p.m., in the 8th.

12:21.630 --> 12:24.130
You're no Tyson yet but it looks like fun.

12:24.755 --> 12:26.546
Why are you here? To train?

12:26.630 --> 12:29.546
No. I never came,
you didn't see me, I'm at work.

12:31.213 --> 12:32.213
So...

12:32.796 --> 12:35.463
Elsa's into you.
I'd be pissed if you were a liar.

12:36.671 --> 12:38.255
You came to her birthday.

12:38.630 --> 12:40.921
So you're either dumb or into her.

12:43.421 --> 12:44.421
I'm into her.

12:46.130 --> 12:47.796
I just don't know what to do.

12:49.505 --> 12:50.713
I can help you.

12:51.505 --> 12:52.546
But I need the truth.

12:53.880 --> 12:54.880
What you do. Who you are.

12:58.630 --> 12:59.463
Huh?

13:02.046 --> 13:03.338
I'll buy you a drink.

13:07.046 --> 13:09.255
You spoke to him towards the end. Why?

13:09.338 --> 13:10.588
I've seen him before.

13:11.296 --> 13:12.296
You know Jules?

13:12.671 --> 13:14.630
Seriously? And you didn't say anything?

13:14.713 --> 13:18.213
You're so obsessed
with this new boyfriend, it's unbearable.

13:18.921 --> 13:22.046
-Where do you know him from?
-A hotel bar, three or four day ago.

13:22.130 --> 13:26.088
I was debriefing a really annoying author.
Jules sat down at the next table.

13:26.171 --> 13:27.171
Was he alone?

13:28.171 --> 13:29.796
-Was he alone or not?
-No!

13:30.463 --> 13:33.213
And she wasn't his mom.
Or they're really close.

13:33.296 --> 13:34.296
Fuck, I knew it!

13:35.546 --> 13:38.338
-Max, we're getting married in 332 days.
-Yes.

13:38.421 --> 13:43.046
So deal with this ambiguity with your ex
and focus on sending the invites, OK?

13:43.796 --> 13:45.713
-I'm all or nothing, GaÃ¯a.
-Me too.

13:45.796 --> 13:47.380
No, you don't get it.

13:48.505 --> 13:51.296
-Why are we together, then?
-Because you love me.

13:53.963 --> 13:56.421
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-I'm sorry.

14:03.838 --> 14:06.213
-Elsa!
-My name is GaÃ¯a, asshole!

14:10.130 --> 14:11.963
<i>OK. Thank you.</i>

14:16.630 --> 14:18.255
No Julio Saldenha at Simone Veil.

14:20.171 --> 14:21.588
No Jules Dupont either.

14:22.255 --> 14:23.380
I'm such an idiot!

14:24.671 --> 14:26.713
And my mates act weird when I mention him.

14:27.463 --> 14:29.630
OK, operation "Time's Up for Jules".

14:30.046 --> 14:32.171
Three phases. One, go back to his place.

14:32.838 --> 14:34.130
Two, beat him up.

14:34.755 --> 14:35.588
And?

14:36.880 --> 14:39.296
Well... you'll have beaten him up.

14:42.671 --> 14:43.671
OK...

15:09.046 --> 15:10.213
Good afternoon, madam.

15:14.255 --> 15:15.546
-Hello.
-How are you?

15:18.088 --> 15:19.088
I'm OK.

15:20.380 --> 15:22.963
-You wore the shirt. Nice.
-Yeah.

15:24.046 --> 15:25.046
Thanks.

15:31.255 --> 15:33.130
This summer, I have Fati till the 15th.

15:33.630 --> 15:36.005
So, I was thinking Capri
as I've never been.

15:36.088 --> 15:37.213
Capri is nice.

15:38.005 --> 15:40.296
I got you some Gucci trunks,
you'll love them.

15:41.796 --> 15:42.796
Thanks.

15:46.838 --> 15:48.671
ValÃ©rie, I need your help.

15:48.755 --> 15:51.421
Well, a favor. For my mother.

15:52.088 --> 15:54.380
-As a friend.
-Shit, is she sick?

15:54.755 --> 15:56.463
No, that's not it...

15:57.338 --> 15:58.588
No school today?

16:00.671 --> 16:01.671
Private tuition?

16:01.755 --> 16:03.005
Elsa, I can explain.

16:03.088 --> 16:05.088
No need, it's very clear.

16:07.005 --> 16:08.005
Julio Saldenha?!

16:10.296 --> 16:12.630
ValÃ©rie Ziegler-Lagarde,
Department of Education.

16:12.713 --> 16:15.546
Innovative programs, Montessori,
London, Paris, New York.

16:16.255 --> 16:17.255
Hello.

16:18.213 --> 16:19.713
-Hello.
-So...

16:19.796 --> 16:21.713
I work with Julio.

16:22.380 --> 16:25.963
Well, I used to. I've found him
less engaged recently.

16:26.046 --> 16:30.046
It turns out he's setting up
his own structure, such a dark horse.

16:30.130 --> 16:33.046
So we're celebrating him leaving
like old friends.

16:34.255 --> 16:35.546
-Right?
-Yeah.

16:36.338 --> 16:37.338
Of course.

16:39.755 --> 16:41.130
Elsa, we could meet, us two.

16:42.505 --> 16:43.963
I don't know, tonight?

16:44.046 --> 16:46.421
8 o'clock at the Chics Types?
Does that work?

16:49.088 --> 16:50.088
OK.

16:51.505 --> 16:53.046
-Have a good evening.
-You too.

16:57.963 --> 16:58.963
Shit... Thank you.

17:08.088 --> 17:09.088
Pick up...

17:10.838 --> 17:14.796
<i>Hello, you've reached Emilie ChÃ¢taigne.</i>
<i>Leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>

17:15.838 --> 17:17.880
Milou, it's me, I...

17:19.713 --> 17:21.546
I'm totally lost.

17:23.338 --> 17:24.338
I'm coming over.

17:25.296 --> 17:26.505
I need to talk to you.

17:31.130 --> 17:32.588
I know you miss me.

17:34.296 --> 17:37.505
Start the site meeting without me,
I'll be there. OK?

17:44.505 --> 17:46.255
Yeah, we'll see about that.

17:46.338 --> 17:48.713
-Excuse me.
-But... Sorry, just a sec.

17:49.713 --> 17:51.630
So, in 30 minutes.

17:51.713 --> 17:52.880
OK, see you.

17:54.421 --> 17:57.630
-Hello. Is this for prenatal yoga?
-Yes, it is.

17:57.713 --> 17:59.921
-Does that ring hurt?
-What are you doing here?

18:00.796 --> 18:03.880
I just... What are <i>you</i> doing here?

18:04.338 --> 18:06.463
-Namaste, Emilie.
-Namaste, Elise.

18:07.796 --> 18:09.713
Emilie? No, I'm Emilie.

18:10.588 --> 18:12.796
-Oh, you're the surrogate mother!
-I'm sorry?!

18:13.171 --> 18:15.421
What you're doing is really beautiful.

18:16.088 --> 18:18.421
-Do I look--
-You've skipped class for months.

18:18.505 --> 18:19.671
Someone needs the info.

18:19.755 --> 18:22.838
I dealt with the sun salutations,
the perineum obsession...

18:22.921 --> 18:24.005
You have no limits.

18:24.088 --> 18:27.255
It's going to be great.
The three of us can do yoga! The <i>familia!</i>

18:27.630 --> 18:30.088
-Can I have a second towel, please?
-Of course.

18:30.171 --> 18:31.380
-You went all out.
-Wait.

18:31.463 --> 18:32.296
Thanks.

18:35.255 --> 18:36.630
It's Antoine.

18:36.713 --> 18:38.171
-Elsa's at home.
-Really?

18:38.255 --> 18:40.380
Come on, let's get changed. Thanks.

18:40.713 --> 18:43.046
-Namaste! Come on, let's go.
-Namaste...

18:50.921 --> 18:52.338
What did you just do?

18:52.963 --> 18:54.838
Did you just shake your head?

18:56.880 --> 18:59.171
He didn't want to say anything.
What's going on?

19:03.755 --> 19:05.130
Go ahead, tell her.

19:13.338 --> 19:14.546
OK, I fucked up.

19:14.963 --> 19:17.255
You're going to hate me
but you should know--

19:17.338 --> 19:18.505
She's dating Matt.

19:18.838 --> 19:20.463
-What?
-Everyone knows.

19:20.796 --> 19:21.963
It's been two months.

19:22.046 --> 19:24.296
-For fuck's sake, Milou.
-Matt, come down!

19:24.380 --> 19:26.755
-We all know you're there.
-He is?

19:26.838 --> 19:29.463
-It was bound to come out one day.
-Seriously, Milou?

19:29.546 --> 19:31.296
How could you not tell me?

19:31.380 --> 19:33.880
We're not really together,
it's early days...

19:33.963 --> 19:34.880
Hello!

19:37.755 --> 19:39.963
-OK...
-Right.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.046
Now tell her the truth.

19:42.630 --> 19:45.921
Like what? She knows Milou goes
to work every day, not yoga.

19:46.005 --> 19:47.213
-What?
-Well, yeah.

19:49.713 --> 19:50.880
And Matt got fired.

19:50.963 --> 19:51.963
What?!

19:52.921 --> 19:55.796
I'm sorry, are we really talking
about me? Seriously?

19:56.505 --> 19:58.338
What about taking responsibility?

19:59.421 --> 20:00.463
What about Jules?

20:04.421 --> 20:05.255
Why?

20:05.338 --> 20:08.255
Wait a minute, what's going on with Jules?

20:09.796 --> 20:11.338
Do you know something about him?

20:13.213 --> 20:14.213
Huh?

20:16.338 --> 20:18.880
-It was Charlotte's idea.
-Are you kidding me?

20:19.421 --> 20:21.630
A shit idea. Like all your ideas.

20:21.713 --> 20:23.963
-You paid for the third date!
-Paid?

20:24.046 --> 20:25.046
Of cou--

20:26.338 --> 20:29.380
What do you mean
you paid for a date? I don't get it.

20:29.463 --> 20:31.755
You... paid Jules?

20:32.588 --> 20:33.588
I don't get it.

20:34.296 --> 20:36.296
-And...
-And what?

20:38.130 --> 20:39.921
Because you all know?

20:42.421 --> 20:44.421
Come on, spit it out!

20:48.380 --> 20:49.755
Fucking talk!

20:53.213 --> 20:56.005
-Well... Jules is...
-Jules is what?

20:56.088 --> 20:58.213
-It's his job.
-What's his job?

20:58.296 --> 21:02.005
I don't get it, what are you
talking about? What's his job?

21:03.838 --> 21:06.630
-A prostitute. Jules is a man-whore.
-Nonsense...

21:07.505 --> 21:09.171
No, Jules isn't...

21:11.255 --> 21:12.255
a man-whore. Right...

21:24.380 --> 21:26.796
-It's OK, this is all wrong.
-We meant well.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.546
-You were so sad.
-We're sorry.

21:29.630 --> 21:32.005
-We didn't know how to save you.
-Save me?!

21:32.630 --> 21:36.213
Save me from what? Am I that pathetic?

21:36.296 --> 21:37.130
No.

21:40.421 --> 21:41.421
Don't touch me.

21:42.505 --> 21:46.963
You know what? I never want
to see you again. Any of you. Ever.

21:47.046 --> 21:48.421
I want you out of my life.

22:30.921 --> 22:32.171
It's all your fault.

22:33.046 --> 22:34.046
I'm sorry?

22:34.505 --> 22:37.588
Are you serious?
"Let's call him back." Ring any bells?

22:38.546 --> 22:42.046
The unemployment, the overdraft,
the half-assed plans.

22:42.130 --> 22:44.505
You needed a good old fuck-up
to spice things up!

22:45.255 --> 22:47.171
Fuck off with your scorn!

22:48.671 --> 22:51.505
What? Do you have any life plans
other than pissing about?

22:51.588 --> 22:53.130
Depending on your brother?

22:53.213 --> 22:54.796
Fucking up Elsa's love life?

22:54.880 --> 22:56.255
Secretly blowing Matt?

22:56.796 --> 22:58.546
Go ahead, I'm listening.

23:00.588 --> 23:01.421
Nothing.

23:02.255 --> 23:04.921
A failure. That's what you are.
You're a failure.

23:08.213 --> 23:11.713
-I'm such an idiot.
-For once, we agree.

23:11.796 --> 23:13.921
I'm the only one who defends you!

23:14.005 --> 23:17.796
"No, Emilie isn't a bitch who treats
her man and friends like shit."

23:17.880 --> 23:20.130
"She's not a rich kid
with fascist parents."

23:20.213 --> 23:23.546
-They're not fascists.
-Sorry, they're just very conservative.

23:23.630 --> 23:26.671
Well, you're going to leave
my very conservative parents' flat.

23:28.630 --> 23:29.963
I was wrong actually.

23:31.338 --> 23:32.755
You see yourself as a mother?

23:34.838 --> 23:37.088
You're nothing, man, you're hollow.

23:37.171 --> 23:38.963
You have no heart. You're empty.

23:40.463 --> 23:41.505
You're the worst.

23:42.213 --> 23:45.713
If you weren't dating my brother,
I wouldn't look at you, you disgust me.

23:46.463 --> 23:48.213
On the contrary, look at me closely.

23:48.296 --> 23:50.921
This is the last time
I waste my energy talking to you.
