00:54.055 --> 00:56.099
You've hidden the Kragle well, old man.

00:56.349 --> 00:58.268
Robots, destroy him!

00:58.518 --> 01:00.228
Yes, Lord Business.

01:00.478 --> 01:02.480
Your robots are no match

For I see everything!

01:05.900 --> 01:06.985
Unh! My eyes! Ow!

Can you feel me?

01:21.082 --> 01:22.082
I can feel you.

01:22.167 --> 01:24.127
Whoo! Nothing's gonna stop me now.

Wait. There was a prophecy.

01:26.129 --> 01:27.672
Oh, now there's a prophecy.

01:27.922 --> 01:29.382

Oh, yes! The supposed
missing Piece of Resistance...

01:32.802 --> 01:35.138
that can somehow magically
disarm the Kragle.

01:35.388 --> 01:36.973
Give me a break!

01:38.558 --> 01:41.352
One day, a talented lass or fellow

01:41.603 --> 01:43.855
A Special One with face of yellow

01:44.105 --> 01:46.733
Will make the Piece of Resistance found

All of this is true

02:04.083 --> 02:05.668
Because it rhymes

02:05.919 --> 02:07.670
Oh, wow.

02:07.921 --> 02:10.715
That was a great, inspiring legend...

02:10.965 --> 02:12.050
that you made up.

02:14.928 --> 02:16.387
A "Special One"?

02:16.638 --> 02:20.308
What a bunch of hippie-dippie baloney.

Breathe."

03:00.223 --> 03:01.349
Okay, got that one down.

Greet the day,
smile and say..."

Brush your teeth.

03:35.008 --> 03:36.885
Comb your hair. Hmm.

03:38.136 --> 03:39.136
"Wear clothes."

03:39.304 --> 03:41.389
Oop! I almost forgot that one!

03:41.639 --> 03:43.182
No. No. Uh-uh. No.

03:43.433 --> 03:44.642
Not that. Wrong.

03:44.893 --> 03:46.269

Drop off dry-cleaning before noon.

Instructions coming in from Central.

05:44.429 --> 05:47.223
Okay, it says here to take
everything weird and blow it up.

05:51.060 --> 05:52.228
All right, Cylinderheads...

05:52.478 --> 05:54.147
let's make it look
like it does in the instructions!

Hey, buddy!

05:55.231 --> 05:56.607
I need a 1-by-2 key hole.

05:56.858 --> 05:57.858
No problem, Michael.

05:58.026 --> 05:59.360
We need a 2-by-2 macaroni.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.446

When we're living our dream

06:23.426 --> 06:25.106

Everyone's talkin'</i>

Yeah!

06:43.112 --> 06:45.823
I'm going to the sports bar
after work tonight.

06:46.074 --> 06:49.452
Who wants to eat some delicious
chicken wings and get crazy?

06:49.702 --> 06:51.142
Chicken wings? I love chicken wings!

06:51.287 --> 06:53.247
Hey, who wants to share a croissant
with this guy?

06:53.289 --> 06:54.489
Croissants? I love croissants.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.417
Oh, yeah! I sure do love giant sausages.

06:56.667 --> 06:57.667
Giant sausages? No way!

06:58.294 --> 06:59.420
You know what I love to do?

06:59.670 --> 07:01.670

07:09.764 --> 07:11.682
Oh, there you are.

07:15.061 --> 07:17.021
I think I heard a whoosh.

07:24.737 --> 07:26.239
Hey, pal, I hate to tell you this...

07:26.489 --> 07:28.449
but, uh, I don't think
you're supposed to be here.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.910
Yeah, the rules specifically state...

07:31.160 --> 07:33.830
work site closes at 6,
it's a hard-hat area only.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.916
That's not official safety orange.

07:38.084 --> 07:41.045
"If you see anything weird,
report it immediately."

07:41.671 --> 07:43.214
Well, I guess I'm gonna...

07:43.756 --> 07:47.760

Come here.

08:50.448 --> 08:53.409
What do I do?
I don't have my instructions.

08:53.659 --> 08:56.245
Touch the Piece.

08:56.495 --> 08:59.957
Touch the Piece. Touch the Piece.

09:01.334 --> 09:04.503
I feel like maybe I should touch that.

09:04.754 --> 09:06.547
It's so...

09:06.797 --> 09:07.965
<i>interesting.</i>

09:08.216 --> 09:09.467
Touch the Piece.

09:12.178 --> 09:14.388
It's so interesting.

09:14.639 --> 09:16.766
Touch the Piece.

09:17.016 --> 09:18.559
Touch the Piece.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.020
- Touch the Piece.
- Uh...

09:21.646 --> 09:23.064
Touch the...

09:25.650 --> 09:28.110
A Special One with face of yellow

09:28.361 --> 09:30.613
Will make the Piece of Resistance found

09:30.863 --> 09:33.449
From its hiding refuge underground

09:33.699 --> 09:34.992
What's going on down here?

09:35.243 --> 09:38.412
This MasterBuilder will thwart
The Kragle and save the realm

09:38.663 --> 09:39.663
Come on, Emmet!

09:39.830 --> 09:40.873
The Special has arisen.

09:41.165 --> 09:42.917
It's your turn to be the hero.

09:44.252 --> 09:45.753
- Wake up.
- Ugh.

09:46.003 --> 09:47.129
Come on, wake up!

09:47.380 --> 09:48.540
Where are the MasterBuilders?

09:48.714 --> 09:50.549
How did you find
the Piece of Resistance? Eh?

09:50.800 --> 09:53.041
- Where are the others hiding?
- Good morning, apartment?

09:53.219 --> 09:54.262
- Aah!

09:54.512 --> 09:56.113
How did you find
the Piece of Resistance?

09:56.222 --> 09:57.222
The piece of what?

09:57.431 --> 09:59.267
The Piece of Resistance.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.820
<i>I... I don't... Where</i> am <i>I?
What's happening?</i>

10:03.980 --> 10:04.980
"What's happening?"

10:05.147 --> 10:06.941
Playing dumb, MasterBuilder.

10:07.191 --> 10:08.567
No. I... "MasterBuilder"?

10:08.818 --> 10:11.404
- Oh. So you've never heard of the prophecy?
- No.

10:11.654 --> 10:12.238
Or The Special?

10:12.488 --> 10:13.155
No, no!

10:13.406 --> 10:14.991
You're a liar! We'll kill you!

10:16.909 --> 10:20.746
Look, urn,
I watch a lot of cop shows on TV.

10:21.497 --> 10:23.374
Isn't there supposed to also be...?

10:24.583 --> 10:26.627
Isn't there supposed to be a good cop?

10:27.920 --> 10:30.631
Oh, yes. But we're not done yet.

10:31.299 --> 10:33.968
Hi, buddy! I'm your friendly
neighborhood police officer!

10:34.218 --> 10:36.499
- Would you like a glass of water?
- Yeah. Yeah, actually.

10:36.554 --> 10:37.554
Too bad.

10:37.555 --> 10:39.056
Security cameras picked up this.

10:39.307 --> 10:43.060
Unh! You were found at the construction
site convulsing with a strange piece.

10:43.311 --> 10:44.311
That's disgusting!

10:44.478 --> 10:46.814
Then why is it permanently stuck
to your back?

10:49.400 --> 10:50.985
Get it off me! Get it off me! Aah!

10:51.235 --> 10:52.635
It won't come off! It's chasing me!

10:52.653 --> 10:54.030
Look, it's not my fault!

10:54.280 --> 10:56.040
I have no idea how this thing
got on my back!

10:56.198 --> 10:57.950
Of course, buddy. I believe you.

10:58.200 --> 10:58.868
Great. Aah!

10:59.118 --> 11:00.578
I "believe" you too.

11:00.828 --> 11:03.247
You see the quotations
I'm making with my claw hands?

11:03.497 --> 11:05.708
It means I don't believe you!

11:05.958 --> 11:07.626
Why else would you show up
with that thing on your back...

11:07.877 --> 11:09.718
just three days before
President Business...

11:09.795 --> 11:12.006
is going to use the Kragle
to end the world?

11:12.256 --> 11:14.300
President Business is gonna end the world?

11:14.550 --> 11:15.843
But he's such a good guy.

11:16.093 --> 11:18.262
And Octan, they make good stuff.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.890
Music, dairy products, coffee, TV shows...

11:21.140 --> 11:24.352
surveillance systems,
all history books, voting machines.

11:24.602 --> 11:25.602
Wait a minute.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.980
Come on, you can't be this stupid.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.607
This is a misunderstanding.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.650
I'm just a regular, normal, ordinary guy.

11:31.901 --> 11:33.986
I'm late to meet my best friends
in the whole world.

11:34.236 --> 11:35.029
They're probably missing me right now.

11:35.279 --> 11:36.739
They're probably out looking around.

11:36.989 --> 11:39.190
"Hey, where's Emmet?
Hey, where's my best friend Emmet?"

11:39.367 --> 11:41.619
Hey, you know what?
Ask all my friends. They'll tell you.

11:42.328 --> 11:44.538
Oh, we asked them, all right.

11:44.789 --> 11:45.789
Boom!

11:45.873 --> 11:47.958
That guy's not a criminal mastermind.

11:48.209 --> 11:49.209
See?

11:49.251 --> 11:52.671
Yeah. You know, he's kind of
an average, normal kind of guy.

11:52.922 --> 11:53.922
Thank you.

11:54.090 --> 11:54.799
But, you know, he's not, like...

11:55.049 --> 11:57.218
normal like us. No.

11:57.468 --> 12:00.179
He's not that special.

12:00.429 --> 12:03.182
Wait, I'm so confused.
Who are we talking about?

12:05.101 --> 12:06.394
Wait, does he work with us?

12:06.644 --> 12:07.978
Gail doesn't remember me?

12:08.229 --> 12:09.229
Look at Randy here.

12:09.355 --> 12:11.857
He likes sausage. That's something.

12:12.108 --> 12:14.652
Gail is perky. That's something.

12:14.902 --> 12:15.444
And Harry...

12:15.694 --> 12:17.863
<i>- ...well...</i>-

12:19.907 --> 12:22.493
When you say the other guy, I go:

12:23.661 --> 12:24.662
Harry's the best!

12:24.912 --> 12:27.039
- Harry's got personality.
- He's weird! He's weird!

12:27.289 --> 12:30.459
I know that guy but I know, like,
zippy-zap about him.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.169
We just talked earlier.

12:32.420 --> 12:34.213
I mean, all he does is say yes...

12:34.463 --> 12:36.507
to everything everybody else is doing.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.884
You know, he's just sort of a "Hmm!"

12:39.135 --> 12:41.846
Little bit of a blank slate, I guess.

12:42.513 --> 12:44.890
<i>That'll be $42, please.</i>

12:45.141 --> 12:49.103
We all have something that makes us
something and Emmet is...

12:51.564 --> 12:52.731
nothing.

12:54.525 --> 12:55.860
There you go.

12:56.527 --> 12:59.113
- I told you I was a nobody.
- Oh.

12:59.363 --> 13:00.906
It's the perfect cover.

13:01.157 --> 13:02.825
Cover? Cover for what?

13:03.075 --> 13:05.661
I can't break him.
Take him to the melting chamber.

13:05.911 --> 13:07.746
What? Aah!

13:10.916 --> 13:13.127
You're gonna melt me'? Am I gonna die?

13:13.377 --> 13:14.712
You'll live. You'll be fine.

13:16.130 --> 13:18.424
President Business.
I have him right here, sir.

13:18.674 --> 13:22.636
Yes, we've told him he'll live
so he doesn't try to escape, but, um...

13:22.887 --> 13:24.138
we're lying to him.

13:24.388 --> 13:25.890
Wait, what did he just say?

13:26.140 --> 13:27.140
Hold still.

13:27.308 --> 13:30.227
Wait! There's obviously been a mix-up here.
You've got the wrong...

13:30.478 --> 13:32.271
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

13:33.689 --> 13:35.107
That is gonna start hurting...

13:35.357 --> 13:36.400
pretty soon.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.342
Ow, ow, ow!

14:04.845 --> 14:05.845
No, no, no!

14:08.098 --> 14:09.850
Whoa. Who are you?

14:14.188 --> 14:15.606
It's you?

14:15.856 --> 14:17.608
Come with me if you wanna not die.

14:21.237 --> 14:23.239
Hi, everybody! How's the melting goi...?

14:23.489 --> 14:24.489
Hey, hey, he)”

14:25.324 --> 14:26.324
Red alert, red alert.

14:26.492 --> 14:29.954
Everyone, to go after The Special.

14:32.331 --> 14:33.332
The tunnel's that way.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.418
Oh, boy!

14:37.086 --> 14:38.254
Oh, sir, you're brilliant.

14:38.921 --> 14:42.258
- We'll build a motorcycle out of the alleyway.
- Ow. Oh.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.436
So, uh, didn't catch your name...

14:54.937 --> 14:58.023
or anything about
what you're, uh, up to.

14:58.274 --> 14:59.692
Or what we're doing here.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.502
It's brilliant, sir, that you pretended
to be a useless nobody...

15:02.945 --> 15:05.072
but you can drop the act with me.
It's cool.

15:05.322 --> 15:06.782
Oh, the act.

15:07.283 --> 15:08.409
Whoa.

15:10.536 --> 15:11.536
Whoa!

15:11.745 --> 15:13.455
Jump on. Let's go!

15:18.210 --> 15:20.379
Hey, uh, I...
Hang on, sir.

15:20.629 --> 15:21.629
All units...

15:21.714 --> 15:23.424
cut him off on Elm, now!

15:23.674 --> 15:24.800
Or whenever you can.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.385
10-4, Bad Cop.

15:26.635 --> 15:27.928
- Watch out!
- Hold on.

15:31.307 --> 15:32.391
We need to meet up with Vitruvius...

15:32.641 --> 15:34.310
- ...and tell him the Piece has been found.
Uh-huh.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.728
They're up on the monorail.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.438
Release the copper choppers.

15:46.488 --> 15:47.488
Oh, no!

15:49.325 --> 15:51.410
Will you please tell me what is happening?

15:51.702 --> 15:54.121
I'm rescuing you, sir.
You're the one the prophecy spoke of.

15:54.371 --> 15:55.371
You're The Special.

15:55.789 --> 15:56.789
Me?

15:58.792 --> 16:00.502
You found the Piece of Resistance.

16:00.753 --> 16:02.046
And the prophecy states...

16:02.296 --> 16:04.465
that you are the most important,
most talented...

16:04.715 --> 16:05.841
most interesting...

16:06.091 --> 16:10.095
and most extraordinary person
in the universe.

16:10.763 --> 16:12.139
That's you. Right?

16:13.390 --> 16:16.518
Uh, yes. That's me.

16:16.769 --> 16:17.769
Great. You drive.

16:17.978 --> 16:18.978
What?

16:27.655 --> 16:28.864
I wanna go home!

16:30.699 --> 16:31.700
This is not what I meant!

16:40.728 --> 16:41.728
Oh, no.

16:41.752 --> 16:42.752
Look out, Special!

16:42.795 --> 16:45.381
Uh, sorry. Never driven a motorcycle.
Sorry!

16:49.343 --> 16:50.761
- Wow, he's amazing.
- Aah!

16:56.225 --> 16:57.351
That was incredible!

16:57.601 --> 16:59.853
You're even better
than the prophecy said you'd be.

17:00.104 --> 17:01.271
Oh. Really?

17:01.522 --> 17:03.148
I'm, uh... I'm Wyldstyle.

17:03.399 --> 17:05.150
- Oh, I'm sorry, what was it?
- Wyldstyle.

17:05.401 --> 17:06.484
- "Wyldstyle"?
- Yep.

17:06.734 --> 17:07.778
- What are you, a DJ?
- No.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.071
- Oh, that's your name? "Wyldstyle"?
- Yeah.

17:10.321 --> 17:11.865
Like on your birth certificate,
it says "Wyldstyle."

17:12.116 --> 17:12.782
Let's not talk about my name!

17:13.032 --> 17:14.410
Don't let The Special get away.

17:14.660 --> 17:15.900
Sir, we've blocked the freeway.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.121
Hang on, sir!

17:17.996 --> 17:18.997
What are you doing?

17:21.083 --> 17:22.083
Let's fly!

17:22.084 --> 17:23.836
Whoa!

17:24.086 --> 17:25.628
Head for the secret tunnel.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.172
Uh, these are the city limits.

17:27.423 --> 17:28.663
Let's just head for the tunnel.

17:29.717 --> 17:31.301
You want me to drive
into that weird swirly hole?

17:31.552 --> 17:32.136
Are you insane?

17:32.386 --> 17:34.096
Don't brake! Go! Don't stop! Go! Now!

17:34.346 --> 17:35.346
I can't do this!

17:35.431 --> 17:37.850
That is against the instructions!

17:39.184 --> 17:40.728
Wait, what's your favorite restaurant?

17:40.978 --> 17:41.978
Any chain restaurant.

17:42.020 --> 17:42.521
Favorite TV show?

17:42.771 --> 17:43.272
Where Are My Pants?

17:43.522 --> 17:44.022
Favorite song?

17:44.273 --> 17:45.315
Everything ls Awesome

17:45.566 --> 17:46.567
Oh, no!

17:55.284 --> 17:57.953
Darn, darn, darn, darny-darn!

18:37.242 --> 18:39.328
Wait. Where are we?

18:41.830 --> 18:43.415
This is so weir...! Ow!

18:43.665 --> 18:45.709
You're not The Special! You lied to me!

18:45.959 --> 18:47.586
It really kind of depends on...

18:47.836 --> 18:49.476
You're not even a MasterBuilder, are you?

18:49.713 --> 18:51.799
Uh, I mean, I know what a MasterBuilder is.

18:52.049 --> 18:55.010
Why don't you tell me what it is?
That way I could see if you're right.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.513
You've ruined the prophecy.

18:58.514 --> 19:01.016
Look, I'm sorry, okay? You just...

19:01.266 --> 19:03.477
You made being special sound so good.

19:03.727 --> 19:06.480
And to think I was going to follow you
to the end of the universe.

19:07.272 --> 19:08.524
You were?

19:09.191 --> 19:10.191
Here's the thing.

19:10.234 --> 19:12.736
How do we know for sure
that I'm not The Special?

19:12.986 --> 19:14.446
- We just don't know it yet.
- Quiet.

19:14.696 --> 19:16.281
Y'all want a giant turkey leg?

19:16.532 --> 19:18.492
Do you have any idea
what that does to your colon?

19:20.869 --> 19:23.872
- Oh, my G-O-S-H.
- Just put the hat on.

19:24.122 --> 19:24.748
Oh...

19:24.998 --> 19:26.667
and this. And this. And this.

19:26.917 --> 19:28.460
- And this.
- Aah!

19:28.710 --> 19:30.337
And, by the way, I have a boyfriend.

19:30.629 --> 19:32.673
Uh, I'm not sure exactly
why you'd bring that up.

19:32.923 --> 19:33.923
It's super serious.

19:34.091 --> 19:35.509
You do not want to mess with him.

19:35.759 --> 19:36.260
Okay)'-

19:36.510 --> 19:37.678
So don't get any ideas.

19:37.928 --> 19:39.596
I never have any ideas.

19:40.491 --> 19:41.491
Wait!

19:41.515 --> 19:43.559
- Stick them up.
- Hands where I can see them.

19:43.809 --> 19:46.770
Hey, uh, listen. You think you can
explain why I'm dressed like this...

19:47.020 --> 19:48.480
and what those big words
in the sky were all about?

19:48.730 --> 19:51.191
And, like, where we are in time.

19:53.694 --> 19:56.488
Your home, Bricksburg,
is one of many realms in the universe.

19:56.738 --> 19:57.738
There's also this one...

19:57.906 --> 20:00.426
Pirate's Cove, Knight's Club,
Viking's Landing, Clown Town...

20:00.492 --> 20:01.702
a bunch of others
we don't need to mention.

20:01.952 --> 20:02.536
Mm-hm.

20:02.786 --> 20:04.587
Lord Business,
or as you think you know him...

20:04.746 --> 20:05.873
President Business...

20:06.123 --> 20:08.959
stole the Kragle,
the most powerful object in the universe.

20:09.501 --> 20:10.878
Blah, blah, blah.

20:11.128 --> 20:13.922
Proper name. Place name. Backstory stuff.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.383
- ...Piece of Resistance is The Special.
Mm-hm.

20:16.633 --> 20:19.011
I'm so pretty. I like you.

20:19.261 --> 20:21.555
But I'm angry with you for some reason.

20:21.805 --> 20:23.056
- ...tower at the end of the universe...
Mm-hm.

20:23.307 --> 20:25.227
Put the Piece of Resistance
onto the Kragle...

20:25.267 --> 20:26.894
and disarm it forever.

20:27.144 --> 20:28.144
Great.

20:28.353 --> 20:29.396
I think I got it...

20:29.646 --> 20:30.689
but just in case...

20:30.939 --> 20:33.019
tell me the whole thing again.
I wasn't listening.

20:34.818 --> 20:38.071
Okay. All the people
of the universe were once free to travel...

20:38.322 --> 20:41.283
and mingle and build
whatever they wanted.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.660
But President Business
was confused by all the chaos.

20:44.745 --> 20:46.496
So he erected walls between the worlds...

20:46.747 --> 20:49.416
and became obsessed
with order and perfection.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.043
And he stole the mysterious...

20:51.293 --> 20:53.128
secret super weapon called...
The Kragle!

20:53.378 --> 20:54.546
And he hired Bad Cop...

20:54.796 --> 20:57.796
to hunt down all the MasterBuilders,
who were always changing everything.

20:58.425 --> 20:59.676
And those of us who remained...

20:59.927 --> 21:03.555
<i>well, we went into hiding.
Built the tunnels to survive.</i>

21:03.805 --> 21:05.485
And we search for the Piece of Resistance.

21:05.724 --> 21:08.310
The only thing that can stop the Kragle.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.728
Kragle. I know that.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.022
It might have been that cop.
He said something about the Kragle.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.441
President Business
was going to use the Kragle...

21:14.691 --> 21:16.052
to end the world in three days.

21:16.193 --> 21:17.353
I can't make any sense of it.

21:17.486 --> 21:18.570
Taco Tuesday.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.989
I knew that was suspicious.
There's no time to lose.

21:21.239 --> 21:24.201
We must find Vitruvius and get to
the Office Tower before it's too late.

21:24.451 --> 21:25.452
Okay)'-

21:25.702 --> 21:27.829
Heh. How scary can someone's office be?

21:37.089 --> 21:39.370
President Business,
we're trying to locate the fugitive...

21:39.591 --> 21:42.886
but his face is so generic it matches
every other face in our database.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.680
Diabolical.

21:44.930 --> 21:47.891
Okay, have Bad Cop meet me in my office...

21:48.141 --> 21:49.742
- ...in 23 seconds. Ciao.
- Will do, sir.

21:49.935 --> 21:51.728
Coffee sales are through the roof, sir.

21:51.979 --> 21:54.299
Glad to hear it.
Let's rebuild that roof to be even higher!

21:54.523 --> 21:55.649
The roof team is on it.

21:55.899 --> 21:58.110
Sir, can you approve this poster
for Taco Tuesday?

21:58.360 --> 21:59.403
Perfect. Whoo!

21:59.653 --> 22:01.653
- I love everyone in this room.
- We love you, sir!

22:01.655 --> 22:04.074
- Great job on the radio station.
- Thank you, sir.

22:04.324 --> 22:06.368
We love listening to this song
over and over again.

22:06.618 --> 22:07.618
Keep it up, GUYS-

22:07.661 --> 22:09.663
Honey, where are my...

22:09.913 --> 22:10.913
- ...pants?
Ha-ha-ha!

22:11.081 --> 22:12.124
Cut! Ha, ha!

22:12.374 --> 22:14.001
Hilarious. That never gets old.

22:14.251 --> 22:15.251
It does not.

22:15.419 --> 22:17.754
Bad Cop is waiting for you
in your office.

22:18.005 --> 22:19.256
Wonderful. Fantastic.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.299
Would you cancel my 2:00?

22:21.550 --> 22:23.677
This next meeting could run a little bit...

22:23.927 --> 22:24.928
deadly.

22:32.811 --> 22:33.895
Activate helmet.

22:35.188 --> 22:36.481
Light sequence.

22:36.732 --> 22:37.732
Flame test.

22:38.984 --> 22:40.485
- Engage dramatic entrance.
- Aah!

22:40.736 --> 22:41.945
Bad Cop.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.197
Lord Business.
I know The Special got away, but...

22:44.448 --> 22:46.199
Don't be so serious.

22:46.450 --> 22:47.576
Where's the other guy?

22:47.826 --> 22:49.661
- Hey, friend.
- Hey, buddy!

22:49.911 --> 22:51.663
- I missed you.
- Aw, did you really?

22:51.913 --> 22:53.593
Have I ever shown you my relic collection?

22:53.665 --> 22:54.833
Nope. I don't think you have.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.723
Nobody knows where this stuff comes from.

22:56.918 --> 22:57.918
This one...

22:58.045 --> 22:59.504
is the Cloak of Ban Da'ld.

22:59.755 --> 23:01.275
I hear it's super painful to take off.

23:01.339 --> 23:02.883
- You wanna try it on?
- Well, um...

23:03.133 --> 23:04.593
No, but thank you.

23:04.843 --> 23:07.345
We've done some great work
over the years together, Bad Cop...

23:07.596 --> 23:09.473
capturing all those MasterBuilders...

23:09.723 --> 23:11.349
and torturing them and whatnot.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.309
Thank you, sir.

23:12.559 --> 23:13.602
Although...

23:13.852 --> 23:15.413
you did let the Piece of Resistance go.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.064
The one thing that can ruin my plans.

23:17.314 --> 23:19.566
The one thing that I asked
you to take care of.

23:20.275 --> 23:21.860
That's super frustrating.

23:22.110 --> 23:24.821
It makes me just wanna pick up whoever...

23:25.072 --> 23:26.865
is standing closest to me...

23:27.115 --> 23:28.825
and throw them through this window...

23:29.076 --> 23:32.746
and out into the infinite abyss
of nothingness!

23:35.832 --> 23:37.667
I wanna do it so bad.

23:37.918 --> 23:39.961
I know you do, sir. Please don't.

23:40.212 --> 23:43.507
And it's not just you, Bad Cop,
that keeps messing up my plans.

23:43.757 --> 23:47.385
People everywhere
are always messing with my stuff.

23:47.886 --> 23:50.472
But I have a way to fix that.

23:50.764 --> 23:54.142
A way to keep things exactly
the way they are supposed to be.

23:54.935 --> 23:56.478
Permanently.

23:56.728 --> 23:58.313
Behold...

23:58.647 --> 24:00.482
the most powerful weapon...

24:00.732 --> 24:02.234
of all the relics:

24:03.360 --> 24:05.695
The Kragle!

24:10.200 --> 24:13.161
As you can see, they're loading the
Kragle in a big machine upstairs.

24:13.411 --> 24:14.411
I call it...

24:14.454 --> 24:16.957
the Tentacle Arm Kragle Outside Sprayer.

24:17.207 --> 24:18.500
Or TAKOS.

24:18.750 --> 24:19.960
The "S" is silent.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.546
So on Taco Tuesday...

24:22.796 --> 24:24.965
it's going to spray the Kragle
over everyone and everything...

24:25.215 --> 24:28.593
with a bunch of super-scary nozzles
like this one!

24:28.844 --> 24:31.805
- I'll show you how it works.
- Sir, I don't know if this is necessary.

24:32.055 --> 24:34.266
Oh, don't worry. I won't test it on you.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.017
I'll do it on your parents!

24:37.394 --> 24:38.394
What?

24:38.562 --> 24:39.896
- Hi, son.
- Hi!

24:40.147 --> 24:41.648
How's it going in the big city?

24:41.898 --> 24:44.025
Mommy. Daddy.
What are you doing here?

24:44.276 --> 24:46.695
Okay, Pa. I just want you to act naturally.

24:46.945 --> 24:48.989
- Like you're going about your day.
- Gotcha.

24:49.239 --> 24:50.699
Yeah. Keep your hand up like that.

24:50.949 --> 24:51.949
Ma, scoot...

24:52.033 --> 24:53.702
two steps in to the right.

24:53.952 --> 24:55.871
- Pa, whenever I talk to Ma...
- Uh-huh?

24:56.121 --> 24:57.247
- ...you start to move.
- Sorry, sir.

24:57.497 --> 24:58.665
Get back to where you were!

24:58.915 --> 24:59.624
- Here?
- Perfect.

24:59.875 --> 25:02.252
That's great. You can't do anything better.
No reason why you should move.

25:02.502 --> 25:03.003
Right.

25:03.253 --> 25:03.753
Now, Ma...

25:04.004 --> 25:05.505
hand on his shoulder. And you...

25:05.755 --> 25:08.091
- Pa, you just moved and you've just wrecked it!
- Uh-huh.

25:08.341 --> 25:09.009
You wrecked it!

25:09.259 --> 25:11.428
Bad Cop, you see what I'm talking about?

25:11.678 --> 25:15.432
All I'm asking for is total perfection.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.100
Send in a Micro-manager!

25:20.228 --> 25:21.396
Commencing micro-management.

25:24.691 --> 25:25.691
Hold still, you guys.

25:28.778 --> 25:29.778
And then...

25:29.821 --> 25:31.072
I just spray them...

25:31.323 --> 25:32.532
With the TAKOS.

25:34.159 --> 25:35.452
Oh, Pa, hold me.

25:35.702 --> 25:38.788
Oh, darling, I can't move me legs.

25:39.039 --> 25:41.041
- Does that upset you, Bad Cop?
- Um...

25:41.291 --> 25:44.544
Surely you feel bad for your parents,
and you wanna help them, don't you?

25:44.794 --> 25:48.590
We're okay, son. Just a
little stuck, is all.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.425
Go ahead...

25:52.093 --> 25:53.678
finish the job.

25:53.929 --> 25:55.222
Of course, sir.

25:55.472 --> 25:56.556
No, I don't want to.

25:56.806 --> 25:58.308
- You have to.
- I don't want to.

25:58.558 --> 26:00.078
- Would you please be quiet?
- I can't.

26:00.310 --> 26:01.631
- You must. Shut it!
- But they...

26:01.686 --> 26:03.647
- it's not nice.
- It's your job, man.

26:03.897 --> 26:05.023
I can't do it.

26:05.273 --> 26:06.858
- They're innocent.
- Just as I thought.

26:07.108 --> 26:09.861
Your Good Cop side's
making you soft, Bad Cop.

26:10.111 --> 26:10.779
Robots!

26:11.029 --> 26:13.406
Bring me the ﬂeece-crested
Scepter of Q-Teep...

26:13.657 --> 26:15.575
and the Pé-Lish Remover of Na-ll.

26:15.825 --> 26:18.078
You've already let The Special
get away once.

26:18.328 --> 26:18.912
Sir.

26:19.162 --> 26:21.206
I'm just gonna make sure
it doesn't happen again.

26:21.456 --> 26:23.625
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

26:28.922 --> 26:29.922
Oh, son!

26:30.131 --> 26:33.843
On Taco Tuesday, I'm going to
Kragleize the entire universe...

26:34.094 --> 26:37.138
so that everyone
will stop messing with my stuff!

26:37.389 --> 26:39.015
Are you gonna be with me...

26:39.266 --> 26:40.725
or are you gonna be stuck...

26:40.976 --> 26:43.895
having a tea party
with your mom and dad?

26:44.145 --> 26:45.145
Son?

26:46.356 --> 26:47.356
Sorry, Dad.

26:48.817 --> 26:50.318
I have a job to do.

27:08.128 --> 27:10.488
All you have to do is blend in
and act like you belong here.

27:10.547 --> 27:11.548
Ah, perfect.

27:11.798 --> 27:14.175
Well, hi there, I'm a cowboy!

27:14.426 --> 27:15.706
Bang, bang, bang-bang-bang-bang!

27:16.386 --> 27:17.637
Shoot, shoot, shoot. Bullet, bullet, gun.

27:17.887 --> 27:19.931
Zap, zap, zap, pow. Zap, pow.

27:20.181 --> 27:22.267
- What are they looking at?
- I made a mistake.

27:22.517 --> 27:23.935
You should just be still. Act like a stool.

27:24.185 --> 27:25.353
- Wait!
- Howdy, guys!

27:25.603 --> 27:27.603
- Quiet. Nope, stools don't talk.
- Come sit on me.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.024
Okay, shh.

27:29.274 --> 27:30.775
Let me show you how it's done.

27:36.114 --> 27:37.114
What a lady!

27:38.700 --> 27:41.161
Okay, let me just find the wizard...

27:41.411 --> 27:43.204
and get this over with.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.670
- Ooh!
- There he is.

27:51.129 --> 27:52.714
- Vitruvius.
- Who?

27:52.964 --> 27:55.467
I've never heard of that man,
whom I am not.

27:55.717 --> 27:57.344
- Who are you?
- It's me.

27:57.677 --> 28:00.180
I am a blind man and cannot see.

28:00.430 --> 28:01.431
- It's Wyldstyle.
- Oof.

28:01.681 --> 28:02.681
Are you a DJ?

28:02.891 --> 28:04.771
- What? Why does everybody...?
- Oh, wait, wait.

28:04.934 --> 28:06.414
Are you the student I used to have...

28:06.561 --> 28:08.402
who was so insecure
she kept changing her name?

28:08.521 --> 28:09.105
No, no, no.

28:09.356 --> 28:10.732
- First Darkstorm, then Geminizzle.
- No. Never.

28:10.982 --> 28:12.942
Then Neversmile, then Freakface,
then Snazzypants.

28:13.151 --> 28:14.151
Okay. All right, yes.

28:14.319 --> 28:16.196
Meet me upstairs in 10 seconds.

28:25.038 --> 28:26.790
Oh, man.

28:27.665 --> 28:29.084
You have a very weirdly...

28:29.334 --> 28:30.960
- ...decorated place.
- Thank you.

28:31.211 --> 28:34.381
Vitruvius, we have found
the Piece of Resistance.

28:34.631 --> 28:36.216
- Is it true?
- Yes, but...

28:36.466 --> 28:38.593
Wyldstyle. The prophecy states that...

28:38.843 --> 28:40.512
you are The Special.

28:40.762 --> 28:43.139
The embodiment of good, foiler of evil.

28:43.390 --> 28:45.308
The most talented, most brilliant...

28:45.558 --> 28:48.395
most important person in the universe.

28:48.645 --> 28:50.897
That would be great...

28:51.606 --> 28:53.326
but Emmet is the one
who found the Piece.

28:54.401 --> 28:55.402
Oh, okay. Emmet!

28:55.652 --> 28:56.861
The prophecy states that...

28:57.112 --> 28:58.738
you are The Special.

28:58.988 --> 29:01.449
- The most talented...
- I'm not sure he's The Special.

29:01.699 --> 29:03.201
Because he's not even
a MasterBuilder. Watch.

29:03.451 --> 29:04.971
Emmet, just given what's around you...

29:05.203 --> 29:06.121
- ...build something simple.
- Okay.

29:06.371 --> 29:07.288
- Like an awesome race car.
- Great.

29:07.539 --> 29:09.040
- Go.
- Do you have the instructions?

29:09.290 --> 29:12.710
No. You must create the instructions
in your mind, my liege.

29:12.961 --> 29:15.296
Ah. Okay. Race car.

29:15.547 --> 29:16.547
Um...

29:16.714 --> 29:19.300
Well, there's a lot of
really cool stuff here.

29:19.551 --> 29:22.429
Don't see a wheel...

29:22.679 --> 29:24.347
OI'...

29:28.476 --> 29:29.978
three more wheels.

29:30.228 --> 29:32.939
See? He can't do it.
He will never be a MasterBuilder.

29:33.189 --> 29:35.483
Of course not.
Not if you keep telling him he can't.

29:35.733 --> 29:37.235
He needs to see that he can.

29:37.485 --> 29:38.485
What are you doing?

29:38.653 --> 29:40.447
- We are entering your mind...
- What?

29:40.697 --> 29:42.740
To prove that you have
the unlocked potential...

29:42.991 --> 29:44.409
to be a MasterBuilder.

29:44.659 --> 29:45.869
Ujjayi breath.

29:52.125 --> 29:53.918
Whoa, are we inside my brain right now?

29:54.169 --> 29:56.838
- It's big. I must be smart.
Mm-hm.

29:57.088 --> 29:59.757
I'm not hearing a lot of activity here.

30:00.008 --> 30:02.510
I don't think he's ever had an
original thought. In his life.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.760
Ha, ha. That's not true.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.805
For instance, one time I wanted to have...

30:06.055 --> 30:08.016
a bunch of my friends over to watch TV...

30:08.266 --> 30:11.686
Not unlike this TV
that just showed up magically.

30:11.936 --> 30:13.771
And not everybody
can fit on my one couch...

30:14.022 --> 30:15.103
and I thought to myself:

30:15.315 --> 30:17.195
"What if there was such a thing
as a bunk bed...

30:17.317 --> 30:18.443
but as a couch?"

30:18.693 --> 30:20.987
Introducing the double-decker couch.

30:21.237 --> 30:24.073
So everyone could watch TV together
and be buddies!

30:24.949 --> 30:26.989
That is literally the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

30:27.202 --> 30:29.537
Please, Wyldstyle, let me handle this.

30:29.787 --> 30:32.624
That idea is just the worst.

30:32.874 --> 30:34.584
There must be something around here...

30:34.834 --> 30:36.002
that proves his potential.

30:36.252 --> 30:38.671
If The Man Upstairs
chose him to be The Special...

30:38.922 --> 30:40.048
there must be a reason.

30:40.298 --> 30:41.549
- Who's The Man Upstairs?
- See?

30:41.799 --> 30:43.519
He doesn't even know about
The Man Upstairs.

30:43.551 --> 30:45.152
Does he have, like, super-gross hands...

30:45.178 --> 30:47.379
that look like they're made
out of big pink sausages?

30:47.388 --> 30:49.390
Like eagle talons mixed with squid?

30:49.641 --> 30:52.185
Wait. You've seen the...?

30:52.871 --> 30:53.871
Whoa!

30:53.895 --> 30:55.730
That's what I was just thinking about.

30:55.980 --> 30:56.648
How did you...?

30:56.898 --> 30:58.024
I had this weird dream
when I touched the Piece.

30:58.274 --> 31:00.276
Well, I mean, I wasn't asleep,
so it wasn't really a dream.

31:00.527 --> 31:02.570
Emmet, you had a vision.

31:02.820 --> 31:03.820
I did?

31:03.863 --> 31:05.323
MasterBuilders spend years...

31:05.573 --> 31:07.533
training themselves
to clear their minds enough...

31:07.617 --> 31:10.870
to have even a fleeting glimpse
of The Man Upstairs...

31:11.120 --> 31:14.791
and yet, your mind is already
so prodigiously empty...

31:15.041 --> 31:18.044
that there is nothing in it
to clear away in the first place.

31:18.294 --> 31:19.379
With proper training...

31:19.671 --> 31:22.048
you could become a great MasterBuilder.

31:22.298 --> 31:23.298
I could?

31:23.466 --> 31:25.718
The prophecy chose you, Emmet.

31:26.302 --> 31:27.929
But I can't do any of the stuff...

31:28.179 --> 31:29.939
that the prophecy
says I'm supposed to do.

31:30.181 --> 31:33.768
All you have to do is to believe.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.060
Then...

31:35.520 --> 31:37.605
you will see everything.

31:38.481 --> 31:39.857
Are you ready, my son?

31:42.986 --> 31:44.654
Yes, I am.

31:45.488 --> 31:46.739
I think.

31:46.990 --> 31:48.783
Then we haven't a moment to lose.

31:49.033 --> 31:50.493
We must assemble...

31:51.160 --> 31:52.495
the MasterBuilders.

31:53.121 --> 31:55.164
Do you think Zeppelins
are a bad investment?

32:07.719 --> 32:09.846
Any of you fellas seen this guy?

32:12.599 --> 32:13.808
Wait a minute, partner.

32:14.058 --> 32:15.727
Draw a cowboy hat on him.

32:22.442 --> 32:24.360
These mechanical birds
will get our message out.

32:24.611 --> 32:26.112
They will go to an Internet cafe...

32:26.362 --> 32:28.002
and e-mail the remaining
MasterBuilders...

32:28.114 --> 32:31.159
who will meet us in the secret realm
of Cloud Cuckooland.

32:31.409 --> 32:33.995
Cuckooland? Wait.
What happened to that whole training part?

32:34.245 --> 32:35.830
Don't worry, Emmet.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.749
Your training begins now.

32:39.250 --> 32:40.250
Piano man...

32:40.293 --> 32:41.293
mope" UP-

32:41.294 --> 32:42.754
Your training begins later!

32:45.006 --> 32:46.006
On three.

32:46.215 --> 32:47.215
One...

32:53.806 --> 32:56.392
- Whew. I think we're in the clear.
- Freeze, turkeys.

32:57.810 --> 32:59.354
All I want is the Piece of Resistance.

32:59.604 --> 33:01.689
We would rather he died
than give it to you.

33:01.939 --> 33:04.233
I would not rather he died.

33:04.484 --> 33:07.403
Look, everybody, we can do this
the easy way, or we can do it...

33:07.654 --> 33:08.321
Go, run!

33:08.571 --> 33:09.947
They took the hard way. Fire!

33:10.198 --> 33:11.199
Fire!

33:12.200 --> 33:14.160
Vitruvius, which way to Cloud Cuckooland?

33:14.410 --> 33:16.204
Head for the big bright thing in the sky.

33:16.454 --> 33:18.289
- You mean the sun?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

33:18.539 --> 33:19.707
Let's get out of here. Here, use this.

33:19.957 --> 33:20.957
What? Wait, hey...

33:21.125 --> 33:22.835
- What are you doing? Aah!
- Let's go!

33:24.295 --> 33:26.047
I don't know what I'm doing.

33:29.384 --> 33:30.384
Good bye.

33:30.551 --> 33:31.678
Boom!

33:38.101 --> 33:39.268
Oh, dang!

33:43.064 --> 33:45.358
Aah! I've got pigs! I hate pigs!

33:45.608 --> 33:47.276
Quit playing around in the mud.
I could use your help.

33:47.527 --> 33:49.404
Wyldstyle, we could really use...

33:49.654 --> 33:50.238
your help!

33:50.488 --> 33:51.488
Oink, oink, oink.

34:08.547 --> 34:09.590
Oink!

34:10.717 --> 34:12.677
Vitruvius, they're gaining on us.
Build something!

34:12.760 --> 34:13.760
Let Emmet try!

34:13.969 --> 34:16.514
No, let's not let Emmet try!
I haven't had any training.

34:16.764 --> 34:17.348
That's okay.

34:17.598 --> 34:19.600
We'll start with
how to become a MasterBuilder.

34:19.851 --> 34:22.395
Trust your instincts.

34:22.645 --> 34:23.645
Okay, okay. Um...

34:23.688 --> 34:25.106
Build something! Build something!

34:25.356 --> 34:26.524
Aha. Take that!

34:30.945 --> 34:33.572
Unless your instincts are terrible.

34:39.871 --> 34:40.871
No! The wheel!

34:46.085 --> 34:48.295
I can't control it much longer!

34:48.545 --> 34:51.632
Emmet, we need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

34:51.882 --> 34:52.467
Um...

34:52.717 --> 34:54.719
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

34:54.969 --> 34:56.763
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

34:57.013 --> 34:59.515
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

34:59.766 --> 35:02.602
Something that spins around.
Spins around. Spins around.

35:03.144 --> 35:04.312
Oh.

35:05.646 --> 35:07.648
Emmet, where are you going?

35:10.359 --> 35:11.359
Oh, this better work.

35:11.527 --> 35:12.820
Hang tight!

35:14.071 --> 35:16.532
Dagnabit!

35:18.534 --> 35:19.702
Well done, Emmet.

35:20.578 --> 35:21.662
Hey! I did it.

35:21.913 --> 35:23.998
Wow. You actually did it.

35:26.501 --> 35:27.501
Train!

35:34.842 --> 35:36.052
Oh, no.

35:36.302 --> 35:37.845
Get off my train.

35:38.095 --> 35:39.095
Run!

35:44.435 --> 35:45.435
Wyldstyle!

35:48.314 --> 35:49.690
Owie!

35:49.941 --> 35:51.067
He's gonna ram us.

35:51.651 --> 35:53.361
Quick, quick, quick! That piece!
Give me that piece.

35:53.611 --> 35:54.862
Huh?

35:55.112 --> 35:56.614
Build a ramp!

36:02.870 --> 36:03.913
What the heck?

36:04.205 --> 36:05.748
Rest in pieces.

36:07.834 --> 36:08.834
- Uh...
- Oh, no.

36:08.918 --> 36:09.918
Wait. No, no, no.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.262
Hey)'-

36:19.762 --> 36:21.556
Thanks for saving my life back there.

36:21.806 --> 36:23.182
Even if, you know...

36:23.432 --> 36:26.561
eventually it turned
out to be pointless.

36:27.270 --> 36:29.522
Well, for what it's worth...

36:29.772 --> 36:32.859
this has been about the greatest
15 minutes of my life.

36:39.782 --> 36:40.782
What the...?

36:43.744 --> 36:45.246
Relax, everybody, I'm here.

36:45.496 --> 36:46.122
Batman!

36:46.372 --> 36:47.498
- What's up, babe?
- Babe!

36:47.748 --> 36:49.542
- What?
- Oh, sorry. Batman, this is Emmet.

36:49.792 --> 36:51.878
Emmet, this is my boyfriend, Batman.

36:52.128 --> 36:53.588
I'm Batman.

36:53.838 --> 36:56.549
That's your boyfriend? Aah!

36:58.551 --> 37:00.219
Batman, huh? Where'd you guys meet?

37:00.469 --> 37:02.847
It's actually a funny story, right, Bat?

37:03.097 --> 37:04.097
There he is.

37:04.307 --> 37:06.392
- "Police" to meet you, Bad Cop.
- Batman!

37:06.642 --> 37:07.310
The pleasure...

37:07.560 --> 37:08.560
is all "spine."

37:08.603 --> 37:09.645
Guess what...

37:09.896 --> 37:10.896
you big dumb baby.

37:10.980 --> 37:13.316
Your car is a baby carriage.

37:14.775 --> 37:16.235
Oh, no, your boyfriend's gone.

37:16.485 --> 37:17.528
- Hey, babe.
- What?

37:17.778 --> 37:18.779
Let's hold hands.

37:21.741 --> 37:23.075
So, uh...

37:23.326 --> 37:25.578
Hey, guys, I think we're about
to crash into the sun.

37:25.828 --> 37:27.914
Yeah, but it's gonna look really cool.

37:33.961 --> 37:36.631
Uh, is this Cloud Cuckooland?
I don't see any clouds.

37:36.881 --> 37:38.591
- Or cuckoos.
- No, no, this is...

37:38.841 --> 37:39.841
Middle Zealand.

37:39.884 --> 37:41.177
A wondrous land...

37:41.427 --> 37:42.947
<i>full of knights, castles, mutton...</i>

37:43.095 --> 37:45.348
torture weapons, poverty,
leeches, illiteracy...

37:45.598 --> 37:46.974
and, um...

37:47.224 --> 37:48.267
Dragon!

37:49.352 --> 37:51.103
Yeah, that too.

37:53.898 --> 37:56.359
Once we arrive at Cloud Cuckooland,
we'll raise an army...

37:56.609 --> 37:57.276
of MasterBuilders to...

37:57.526 --> 38:00.655
Anyway, you guys gotta check out
these new subwoofers I installed.

38:00.905 --> 38:02.907
I call them the dogs. Listen to them bark!

38:04.825 --> 38:05.826
Can you turn that down a little bit?

38:06.077 --> 38:08.663
This is a song I wrote for Wyldstyle.

38:08.913 --> 38:10.289
Darkness

38:10.539 --> 38:11.958
It's about how I'm an orphan.

38:12.208 --> 38:13.709
No parents

38:13.960 --> 38:15.461
This is real music, Emmet.

38:15.711 --> 38:18.339
Batman's a true artist. Dark, brooding.

38:18.589 --> 38:20.549
Well, I'm dark and brooding too.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.677
Guys, look, a rainbow.

38:22.927 --> 38:24.647
So you're gonna drive up the curved part...

38:24.720 --> 38:25.429
Super rich

38:25.680 --> 38:27.120
take it all the way to the top...

38:27.139 --> 38:28.599
Kind of makes it better

38:28.849 --> 38:30.101
and park the car.

38:30.351 --> 38:34.146
Friends, welcome
to Cloud Cuckooland. Now...

38:37.441 --> 38:39.819
I just need to give the secret knock.

38:51.288 --> 38:52.873
Okay)'-

39:00.131 --> 39:01.048
I'm just gonna come right out.

39:01.298 --> 39:04.093
I have no idea what's going on,
or what this place is at all.

39:04.343 --> 39:07.555
Hi! I am Princess Unikitty...

39:07.805 --> 39:11.058
and I welcome you all
to Cloud Cuckooland.

39:13.477 --> 39:15.604
There's no signs or anything.

39:15.855 --> 39:17.773
How does anyone know what not to do?

39:18.024 --> 39:19.233
Here in Cloud Cuckooland...

39:19.483 --> 39:20.568
there are no rules.

39:20.818 --> 39:22.194
There's no government...

39:22.486 --> 39:23.779
no babysitters...

39:24.030 --> 39:25.197
no bedtimes...

39:25.448 --> 39:26.991
no frowny faces...

39:27.283 --> 39:29.076
no bushy mustaches...

39:29.326 --> 39:31.537
and no negativity of any kind.

39:31.787 --> 39:33.747
You just said the word "no"
like a thousand times.

39:33.914 --> 39:36.167
And there's also no consistency.

39:36.459 --> 39:38.210
I hate this place.

39:38.461 --> 39:40.337
Any idea is a good idea...

39:40.588 --> 39:42.214
except the not happy ones.

39:42.465 --> 39:44.341
Those you push down deep inside...

39:44.592 --> 39:46.802
where you'll never, ever, ever...

39:47.053 --> 39:47.636
ever...

39:47.887 --> 39:49.597
find them.

39:49.847 --> 39:52.224
Your fellow MasterBuilders
are gathered in the Dog.

39:52.475 --> 39:53.601
The what?

39:56.395 --> 39:57.897
Ah! Is that Superman?

39:59.125 --> 40:00.125
Girl, what are you doing?

40:00.149 --> 40:01.984
- Hey, Superman!
- Oh, hey. What's up?

40:02.234 --> 40:04.070
- Lantern. Green Lantern.
- Yeah, yeah.

40:04.320 --> 40:05.840
You wanna sit together at the meeting?

40:06.072 --> 40:08.616
Um, I have to go back to Krypton.

40:08.866 --> 40:09.909
Didn't Krypton blow up?

40:10.159 --> 40:13.329
My fellow MasterBuilders,
including but not limited to...

40:13.579 --> 40:14.779
Robin Hood, Mermaid Lady...

40:14.830 --> 40:15.331
Gandalf...

40:15.581 --> 40:16.082
Swamp Creature...

40:16.332 --> 40:18.084
- ...1980-something Space Guy...
- Hello!

40:18.334 --> 40:20.169
2002 NBA All-Stars...

40:20.419 --> 40:22.004
- ...and Wonder Woman.
- Unh!

40:22.254 --> 40:25.549
You have traveled far to be here
for a moment of great import.

40:25.800 --> 40:26.800
We have learned...

40:26.967 --> 40:28.886
that Lord Business plans to unleash...

40:29.136 --> 40:30.721
a fully weaponized Kragle...

40:30.971 --> 40:32.431
on Taco Tuesday...

40:32.681 --> 40:35.059
to end the world as we know it.

40:36.310 --> 40:37.436
Please, calm yourselves.

40:37.686 --> 40:38.187
Green Ninja...

40:38.437 --> 40:38.938
Milhouse...

40:39.188 --> 40:39.897
Nice Vampire...

40:40.147 --> 40:41.427
Michelangelo, Michelangelo...

40:41.649 --> 40:42.650
and Cleopatra.

40:42.900 --> 40:44.610
There is yet one hope.

40:44.860 --> 40:46.737
The Special has arisen.

40:48.572 --> 40:50.241
Have the young man step forward.

40:50.491 --> 40:51.492
As you wish, Dubbledore.

40:51.742 --> 40:52.451
I'm Gandalf!

40:52.701 --> 40:54.745
- It's pronounced "Dumbledore."
- Dubbadore?

40:54.995 --> 40:56.247
No, "Dumbledore."

40:56.497 --> 40:57.206
Thought you said "Dubbadore."

40:57.456 --> 40:58.040
Vitruvius!

40:58.290 --> 41:00.650
You gotta write that down.
I'm not gonna remember any of it.

41:00.751 --> 41:01.961
But here we go.

41:03.587 --> 41:07.174
The Special will now give
an eloquent speech.

41:11.470 --> 41:13.055
Go ahead, man. You got this.

41:14.849 --> 41:15.850
Okay)'-

41:22.273 --> 41:24.525
Hello. I'm Emmet.

41:24.984 --> 41:26.902
Oh, and this is the Piece of Resistance.

41:36.412 --> 41:37.580
Thank you.

41:38.122 --> 41:40.916
Well, uh, I know that I, for one...

41:41.167 --> 41:43.419
am very excited to work with you guys...

41:43.669 --> 41:45.629
to get into the Octan Tower,
find the Kragle...

41:45.838 --> 41:47.840
and put this thing on the thing.

41:48.090 --> 41:50.593
And I know it's going to
be really hard, but...

41:50.843 --> 41:52.094
"Really hard"?

41:53.470 --> 41:56.807
Wiping ye burn with a hook
for a hand is really hard.

41:57.057 --> 41:58.726
This be impossible.

41:58.976 --> 42:01.812
The last time we tried to storm
Lord Business' office...

42:02.062 --> 42:04.231
we used every plan we could conceive.

42:04.481 --> 42:07.735
The result was a massacre
too terrible to speak of.

42:08.319 --> 42:09.319
Who are you?

42:09.361 --> 42:11.447
The name be Metal Beard.

42:11.697 --> 42:14.200
And I'll tell you me tale of woe.

42:14.450 --> 42:16.076
Oh, great, here we go again.

42:16.327 --> 42:16.952
I arrived...

42:17.203 --> 42:18.403
<i>at the foot of the Tower...</i>

42:18.621 --> 42:21.290
with me hearty MasterBuilder crew...

42:21.540 --> 42:25.544
<i>only to find the Kragle was all
the way up on the infinityeth floor...</i>

42:25.794 --> 42:28.130
guarded by a robot army...

42:28.380 --> 42:29.461
and security measures...

42:29.590 --> 42:30.799
of every kind...

42:31.050 --> 42:32.176
imaginable:

42:32.426 --> 42:33.469
Lasers...

42:34.220 --> 42:35.554
sharks...

42:35.971 --> 42:37.765
laser sharks...

42:38.015 --> 42:39.516
overbearing assistants...

42:40.851 --> 42:42.853
and strange, dangerous relics...

42:43.103 --> 42:44.103
that entrap...

42:44.146 --> 42:44.730
<i>II-Snap...</i>

42:44.980 --> 42:45.980
and zap.

42:46.190 --> 42:50.110
And there be a mysterious room
called the Think Tank.

42:51.153 --> 42:52.571
I barely made it out of that...

42:52.821 --> 42:53.447
<i>I"OOfT7...</i>

42:53.697 --> 42:54.697
with just me head!

42:56.617 --> 42:58.744
And organs.

42:58.994 --> 42:59.662
Okay)'-

42:59.912 --> 43:02.665
I had to replace every part
of my once-strapping...

43:02.915 --> 43:04.333
virile pirate body...

43:04.583 --> 43:08.128
with this useless hunk of garbage
ye see before ye.

43:08.379 --> 43:12.007
So if ye think it'd be a
good idea to return...

43:12.258 --> 43:13.379
to that forsaken place...

43:13.550 --> 43:14.635
Special...

43:14.885 --> 43:16.929
what idea have ye that be better...

43:17.179 --> 43:18.722
than the ideas of 100...

43:18.973 --> 43:21.433
of our fallen MasterBuilder brothers?

43:21.976 --> 43:23.310
Well, uh...

43:23.560 --> 43:26.438
Well, technically I'm not exactly
a MasterBuilder yet.

43:26.689 --> 43:27.689
What?

43:29.024 --> 43:31.610
Please! Everyone! Please!

43:32.278 --> 43:33.279
Rubbish!

43:33.529 --> 43:35.155
Yes, it's true.

43:35.406 --> 43:38.075
I may not be a MasterBuilder.

43:38.325 --> 43:40.244
I may not have a lot of experience...

43:40.494 --> 43:43.622
fighting or leading
or coming up with plans.

43:44.206 --> 43:46.166
Or having ideas in general.

43:47.001 --> 43:49.962
In fact, I'm not all that smart.

43:50.212 --> 43:53.841
And I'm not what you'd call
a "creative type."

43:54.383 --> 43:55.551
Plus...

43:55.801 --> 43:57.886
generally unskilled.

43:58.887 --> 43:59.930
Also...

44:00.180 --> 44:02.850
scared and cowardly.

44:03.976 --> 44:05.394
I know what you're thinking:

44:05.978 --> 44:08.022
"He is the least qualified person...

44:08.272 --> 44:10.482
in the world to lead us."

44:11.525 --> 44:12.901
And you are right.

44:13.152 --> 44:16.113
This is supposed to make us feel better?

44:16.363 --> 44:18.532
No, there was about to be a "but."

44:18.782 --> 44:20.617
- You're a butt!
- Yes.

44:20.868 --> 44:23.078
You all be on your own!

44:23.329 --> 44:25.831
I be leaving this lost cause!

44:28.083 --> 44:29.084
Why are you leaving?

44:29.335 --> 44:32.254
A house divided against itself
would be better...

44:32.504 --> 44:33.589
than this.

44:33.839 --> 44:35.132
Abraham Lincoln!

44:35.382 --> 44:37.301
You bring your space chair right back here!

44:37.551 --> 44:39.178
Come on, guys!

44:39.428 --> 44:42.139
We can still do this. Right?

44:42.389 --> 44:44.016
You're not even a bit special.

44:44.266 --> 44:46.810
Well, you were right about him
being a ding-dong.

44:47.061 --> 44:48.645
You're a huge disappointment.

44:49.396 --> 44:52.107
Get him out of here.
I don't wanna look at him.

44:55.694 --> 44:57.905
Well, at least it can't get any worse.

45:00.115 --> 45:01.283
I was wrong.

45:04.870 --> 45:06.288
It's the Orb of Tee-ti-list!

45:07.456 --> 45:09.291
Ruh-roh. It's the bad guys.

45:10.250 --> 45:11.335
Whoa. How did he...?

45:11.585 --> 45:14.296
Go! Run! Come on, everyone!
Protect The Special.

45:14.546 --> 45:15.923
What's that on his ankle?

45:17.132 --> 45:18.717
It's a tracking device.

45:20.052 --> 45:20.928
Take the MasterBuilders prisoner.

45:21.178 --> 45:22.679
Oh, he led them right to us.

45:22.930 --> 45:25.099
Guys, no, no, no. It's not my fault.

45:25.349 --> 45:28.435
You are the worst leader I've ever seen.
To the Batmobile!

45:30.164 --> 45:31.164
Dang it.

45:31.188 --> 45:32.189
To the invisible jet!

45:34.108 --> 45:35.984
- Dang it!
- Every man for himself.

45:36.235 --> 45:38.028
No, we must protect the Piece.

45:38.278 --> 45:39.655
Shaq, do you know what time...

45:39.905 --> 45:41.782
- ...it is?
- It's game time.

45:44.952 --> 45:46.662
Y'all ready for this?

45:48.622 --> 45:50.374
Oh, no! They were ready for that.

45:50.624 --> 45:51.250
It didn't break!

45:51.500 --> 45:53.252
Because it's Kragled. Machine gum!

45:54.795 --> 45:55.795
Fire!

45:55.963 --> 45:56.963
No!

45:57.047 --> 45:58.632
Aah! I can't move!

45:58.882 --> 45:59.591
Don't worry, Superman.

45:59.842 --> 46:01.443
- I'll get you out of there.
- No! Don't!

46:01.593 --> 46:05.514
Aah! Oh, my gosh. My hands are stuck.
My legs are stuck as well.

46:05.764 --> 46:06.765
I super hate you.

46:07.057 --> 46:10.352
- Ow! You're pulling my torso off.
- Babe...

46:10.602 --> 46:11.723
help me get him out of here.

46:11.728 --> 46:12.980
I said "every man for himself."

46:13.272 --> 46:14.857
Hey, you gotta be there for me.

46:18.902 --> 46:19.902
Fine!

46:20.028 --> 46:21.530
Fine. Fine. Fine.

46:21.780 --> 46:23.657
- I need you to have a better attitude.
- I have a great...

46:23.907 --> 46:25.534
- ...attitude.
- Ouch.

46:25.784 --> 46:27.411
The Special's in the northwest quadrant.

46:27.661 --> 46:28.912
We've got him cornered.

46:29.932 --> 46:30.932
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.

46:30.956 --> 46:31.956
Where'd he go?

46:36.712 --> 46:37.712
Oh, no!

46:37.754 --> 46:39.506
They've hit our silly cloud stabilizers!

46:39.756 --> 46:41.592
Let's go!
We need to get Emmet out of here.

46:41.842 --> 46:44.845
- Can't we build something?
- Hey! I'm Ben. But you can call me Benny.

46:45.095 --> 46:46.335
I can build a spaceship. Watch.

46:46.513 --> 46:48.724
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship
Spaceship, spaceship

46:48.974 --> 46:50.851
No! You can't. The skies are surrounded.

46:51.101 --> 46:53.145
That's okay. I didn't really wanna build...

46:53.395 --> 46:54.795
a spaceship anyway. That's cool.

46:54.897 --> 46:56.458
Where can we go
where we can't be found?

46:56.648 --> 46:58.150
Maybe we could go underwater?

46:58.400 --> 47:00.027
What if we went underwater?

47:00.277 --> 47:00.986
Great idea, babe!

47:01.236 --> 47:02.916
Thank you, Batman.
Your ideas are the best.

47:03.155 --> 47:03.864
But I just said that.

47:04.114 --> 47:07.075
- We could build a submarine.
- A Bat-Submarine, patent pending.

47:07.326 --> 47:08.326
With rainbows!

47:08.327 --> 47:10.204
And dream catchers, in case we take a nap.

47:10.454 --> 47:11.788
Like an underwater spaceship!

47:12.039 --> 47:13.640
But you can't build all of them at once.

47:13.707 --> 47:15.083
Ready? Break.

47:15.334 --> 47:15.959
Okay)'-

47:16.210 --> 47:19.296
Blue razzleberry and sour apple!

47:19.546 --> 47:21.381
If anybody has black parts,
I need them, okay?

47:21.632 --> 47:22.758
I only work in black.

47:23.008 --> 47:25.010
And sometimes, very, very dark gray.

47:25.260 --> 47:26.428
- Use the yellow bricks!
- Hey, guys, can I help?

47:26.678 --> 47:28.680
- No! It has to be this way!
- No, I need that!

47:28.931 --> 47:29.640
Where is he?

47:29.890 --> 47:32.059
Anyone know what this is,
and do you need it?

47:32.309 --> 47:34.150
I think we could use wings
and rocket boosters.

47:34.228 --> 47:35.729
Ew. Get your retro space stuff
out of my area.

47:35.979 --> 47:38.941
You guys, hey, just tell me exactly
what to do. And how to do it.

47:39.191 --> 47:42.361
Emmet, don't worry about
what the others are doing.

47:42.819 --> 47:46.490
You must embrace
what is special about you!

47:55.100 --> 47:56.100
There he is!

47:56.124 --> 47:58.085
All units, attack the sub!

48:02.589 --> 48:03.882
Emmet, get in here!

48:09.179 --> 48:11.557
Stop him! Stop him! Don't let him...

48:11.807 --> 48:12.807
get to the water!

48:13.016 --> 48:14.256
Dive, dive, dive! Everybody in!

48:14.309 --> 48:15.309
We're going under!

48:32.995 --> 48:34.246
Oh, no.

48:54.391 --> 48:55.809
My home.

48:57.728 --> 48:59.479
It's gone.

49:02.858 --> 49:05.569
I feel something inside.

49:05.819 --> 49:07.821
It's like the opposite of happiness.

49:08.071 --> 49:11.575
I must stay positive.

49:14.494 --> 49:15.494
Ah. Bubble gums.

49:17.331 --> 49:18.331
Butterflies.

49:23.003 --> 49:24.963
Cotton candy.

49:25.839 --> 49:27.883
Gosh, I'm so sorry, Unikitty.

49:29.801 --> 49:32.137
Do you want to sit down
and talk about it?

49:32.846 --> 49:36.516
What the heck is that?

49:36.767 --> 49:38.518
It's a double-decker couch.

49:38.769 --> 49:40.489
Which seemed like a good idea
at the time...

49:40.520 --> 49:43.857
but I now realize
it's not super helpful.

49:44.358 --> 49:46.652
But, you know, it has cup holders.

49:46.902 --> 49:49.446
Seats flip up with coolers underneath.

49:50.781 --> 49:53.575
You are so disappointing
on so many levels.

49:53.825 --> 49:56.578
- Why are my pants cold and wet?
- Ew.

49:56.828 --> 49:58.163
Uh...

49:59.058 --> 50:00.058
Hull breach.

50:00.082 --> 50:01.166
The walls are crying!

50:01.416 --> 50:03.502
We're coming apart at the seams!

50:04.795 --> 50:06.213
This is not how Batman dies.

50:07.422 --> 50:08.423
Emmet!

50:08.674 --> 50:10.509
- Hold on, hold on!
- Wyldstyle!

50:12.552 --> 50:14.429
Deep breath! Deep breath, everybod...!

50:32.239 --> 50:35.325
Micro-managers,
what's going on down there?

50:36.118 --> 50:38.161
Scanning submarine wreckage.

50:39.246 --> 50:41.331
No survivors detected.

50:41.581 --> 50:44.584
Scuba cops,
dredge the entire ocean if you have to.

50:44.835 --> 50:46.753
We have got to find that Piece.

50:47.003 --> 50:48.964
Let's get these prisoners
back to Lord Business...

50:49.214 --> 50:50.465
and give him the good news.

50:50.716 --> 50:53.427
The Special is no more.

50:57.806 --> 50:59.099
Hello, everybody!

50:59.349 --> 51:02.227
Superman. Wonder Woman,
I had no idea you'd be here.

51:02.477 --> 51:03.770
Mr. Shaquille O'Neal.

51:04.020 --> 51:05.856
Greetings, all!

51:06.106 --> 51:08.358
Welcome to my Think Tank.

51:08.775 --> 51:10.694
Help us!

51:10.944 --> 51:13.145
All the MasterBuilders
you've captured over the years...

51:13.155 --> 51:14.276
you've brought them here.

51:14.281 --> 51:16.825
You're a very perceptive person, Superman.

51:17.075 --> 51:20.370
They come up with all the instructions
for everything in the universe.

51:20.746 --> 51:21.746
Robots!

51:21.872 --> 51:24.166
No! No! Grr!

51:28.462 --> 51:29.963
Can't get much worse than this.

51:30.213 --> 51:32.382
- Uh, hello, neighbor.
- Oh, no.

51:32.632 --> 51:33.632
It's Green Lantern.

51:33.800 --> 51:36.887
Oh, my gosh, we're roommates!
How crazy is that?

51:37.137 --> 51:39.765
Does anyone have some Kryptonite
that they could give me?

51:40.474 --> 51:43.351
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where is The Special?

51:43.602 --> 51:46.521
The Special and the Piece of Resistance
are at the bottom of the ocean.

51:46.772 --> 51:48.523
Wait, are you telling me
you don't have him?

51:48.774 --> 51:52.402
Sir, my scuba team is looking
for his remains as we speak.

51:52.652 --> 51:56.615
Bad Cop, he could still be alive!
The Piece could still be out there.

51:56.865 --> 52:00.327
The only remnant of The Special
was a double-decker couch.

52:00.619 --> 52:01.870
Wait, hold on.

52:02.120 --> 52:03.997
A double-decker couch?

52:04.247 --> 52:04.790
Yes, sir.

52:05.040 --> 52:08.960
Really? So it's like a bunk-bed couch?
Is that what it's like?

52:09.211 --> 52:10.420
That's weird.

52:10.670 --> 52:12.190
If you're sitting in the top middle...

52:12.422 --> 52:14.782
how are you gonna get down
without climbing over someone?

52:14.800 --> 52:17.177
If you're sitting on the bottom
and you're watching TV...

52:17.427 --> 52:20.055
are you gonna have to watch
through a bunch of dangling legs?

52:20.305 --> 52:22.057
Who's gonna want to sit on the bottom?

52:22.307 --> 52:23.558
It is literally...

52:23.809 --> 52:27.813
the most useless idea
I have ever heard.

52:30.816 --> 52:33.026
- Well, we're still alive.
- Yeah!

52:33.276 --> 52:35.445
Heh. The double-decker couch.

52:35.695 --> 52:37.405
It wasn't totally pointless after all.

52:37.656 --> 52:39.491
It's the one thing that stayed together.

52:39.741 --> 52:41.493
I always believed in you, Emmet.

52:41.743 --> 52:44.538
I don't mean to spoil the party,
but does anyone else notice...

52:44.788 --> 52:46.998
we're stuck in the middle
of the ocean on this couch?

52:47.249 --> 52:49.125
I mean, it's not like a
big gigantic ship...

52:49.376 --> 52:50.752
is gonna come out of nowhere
and save us...

52:51.002 --> 52:52.087
My gosh!

52:56.299 --> 52:58.260
Avast, mateys!

53:05.433 --> 53:08.228
Metal Beard, I thought you said
we were a lost cause!

53:08.478 --> 53:09.479
Ye are!

53:09.729 --> 53:11.606
Did ye not hear me whole story...

53:11.857 --> 53:15.068
circumscribing the folly
of this whole enterprise?

53:15.318 --> 53:17.654
Well, it's kind of hard not to hear
when you're yelling everything.

53:17.904 --> 53:19.322
So why did you come back?

53:19.573 --> 53:21.950
This be-doubled land couch.

53:23.076 --> 53:26.872
I watched Lord Business' forces
completely overlook it.

53:27.122 --> 53:29.249
Which means we need more ideas like it!

53:29.499 --> 53:30.166
Oh, thank you.

53:30.417 --> 53:32.335
Ideas so dumb and bad...

53:32.586 --> 53:36.464
that no one would ever think
they could possibly be useful.

53:36.715 --> 53:38.300
Oh. Thank you.

53:38.550 --> 53:41.094
So, Special, what do we do?

53:44.431 --> 53:46.182
Uh...

53:47.225 --> 53:48.435
Well...

53:48.894 --> 53:52.814
what's the last thing Lord Business
expects MasterBuilders will do?

53:53.064 --> 53:53.690
Build a spaceship?

53:53.940 --> 53:54.441
Kill a chicken?

53:54.691 --> 53:55.691
Marry a marshmallow.

53:55.775 --> 53:56.359
Why, this:

53:56.610 --> 54:00.113
How you gonna keep 'em down on the farm?

54:00.363 --> 54:03.241
No! It's follow the instructions.

54:04.618 --> 54:05.939
- Don't like that.
- Sounds weird.

54:06.077 --> 54:07.996
Now, listen. Wait, listen.

54:10.206 --> 54:13.919
Guys, you're all so talented
and imaginative.

54:14.502 --> 54:17.505
But you can't work together as a team.

54:18.632 --> 54:20.634
I'm just a construction worker.

54:20.884 --> 54:23.845
But when I had a plan and we were
all working together...

54:24.095 --> 54:26.640
I mean, we could build a skyscraper.

54:28.767 --> 54:31.478
Now, you're MasterBuilders.

54:31.728 --> 54:35.732
Just imagine what could happen
if you did that.

54:37.067 --> 54:39.110
You could save the universe.

54:39.611 --> 54:42.280
Well said, Emmet. Well said.

54:42.739 --> 54:43.739
Really?

54:43.782 --> 54:46.076
She be a fine speech there, laddie.

54:46.701 --> 54:47.702
Okay)'-

54:49.412 --> 54:51.665
Somebody get me some markers...

54:53.500 --> 54:55.502
some construction paper...

54:57.712 --> 55:00.340
and some glitter glue!

55:03.218 --> 55:04.218
I call this:

55:04.344 --> 55:06.429
"Emmet's plan to get
inside the Tower...

55:06.680 --> 55:08.400
put the Piece of Resistance
on the Kragle...

55:08.431 --> 55:09.891
and save the world."

55:10.141 --> 55:12.310
I've built a hundred just like them
back in the city.

55:12.769 --> 55:15.271
If we can just get in, I know where
the air ducts and wiring are located.

55:15.522 --> 55:16.522
I can get us anywhere.

55:16.690 --> 55:17.899
How will we get inside?

55:18.608 --> 55:19.734
In a spaceship.

55:19.985 --> 55:22.570
- Spaceship! Ha, ha!
- Great idea. A Bat-Spaceship.

55:22.821 --> 55:24.948
No, they're expecting us to show up...

55:25.198 --> 55:28.410
in a Bat-Spaceship, or a pirate
spaceship or a rainbow-sparkle spaceship.

55:28.660 --> 55:30.021
One of those sounds awesome to me.

55:30.036 --> 55:32.080
My idea is to build a spaceship...

55:32.330 --> 55:35.000
that's exactly like all the other
Octan delivery spaceships.

55:35.250 --> 55:38.420
So not the special spaceship that
I'm building for all of you right now?

55:38.670 --> 55:40.046
Sorry, Benny. Maybe next time.

55:40.296 --> 55:43.174
Ooh, you're really letting the oxygen
out of my tank here.

55:44.551 --> 55:46.591
Yeah, but according
to your precious instructions...

55:46.720 --> 55:48.221
this ship needs a hyperdrive.

55:48.471 --> 55:49.471
We don't have that part.

55:49.597 --> 55:50.597
Maybe we could find one!

55:50.682 --> 55:53.363
What do you think, a spaceship
is just gonna appear out of the blue?

55:53.435 --> 55:54.519
Are you kidding me?

55:54.769 --> 55:55.854
The same thing!

56:00.627 --> 56:01.627
- Chewie!
- Mm!

56:01.651 --> 56:04.029
We're supposed to be halfway
to Naboo for a sweet party!

56:04.279 --> 56:05.947
This hyperdrive keeps malfunctioning...

56:06.197 --> 56:07.991
taking us to loser systems like this.

56:08.241 --> 56:09.784
Captain Solo, we must go.

56:10.035 --> 56:12.075
You know how perturbed I get
if we are not punctual.

56:12.078 --> 56:13.455
The Droid's right. Let's roll.

56:13.705 --> 56:15.331
Now hold on, Han.

56:15.582 --> 56:18.001
This might be the right galaxy after all.

56:18.251 --> 56:20.545
Because I see a heavenly body.

56:20.795 --> 56:24.299
Ooh, whoa, I have a boyfriend.
And it is super serious. Right, babe?

56:24.549 --> 56:25.884
- Of course it's serious.
- Yeah!

56:26.134 --> 56:28.053
- Got room for just one dude?
- Whoa! Babe!

56:28.303 --> 56:30.346
If he's a cool dude like you.

56:30.597 --> 56:31.718
You're trying to bail on us!

56:31.931 --> 56:32.557
I'm not trying to bail!

56:32.807 --> 56:34.559
You asked them if you could go
with them on their party ship!

56:34.809 --> 56:36.329
That thing is filled with bon vivants.

56:36.352 --> 56:37.352
You speak French now?

56:37.437 --> 56:40.565
Babe, look, if this relationship
is ever gonna work between us...

56:40.815 --> 56:42.192
I need to feel free to party...

56:42.442 --> 56:44.402
with a bunch of strangers
whenever I feel like it.

56:44.486 --> 56:44.986
What?

56:45.236 --> 56:46.236
Babe!

56:47.405 --> 56:48.990
I will text you.

56:49.240 --> 56:52.452
Where'd you get that
sweet space cape, brother?

56:53.369 --> 56:55.705
It's party time!

56:56.748 --> 56:57.832
Babe?

57:06.925 --> 57:10.095
Wyldstyle, you're such an amazing person.

57:10.345 --> 57:14.349
And, you know,
if Batman can't see that, then he's just...

57:14.599 --> 57:18.603
Well, he's just as blind as a guy...

57:19.187 --> 57:21.731
whose eyes stopped working.

57:22.982 --> 57:24.526
And I'm gonna tell you something:

57:24.776 --> 57:27.112
Batman is the worst person I've ever met.

57:27.362 --> 57:29.114
- Need a hyperdrive?
- No way.

57:29.364 --> 57:30.990
- Babe!
- I knew it! I knew that.

57:31.241 --> 57:32.492
You really had me there!

57:32.742 --> 57:35.495
Those guys were so lame.
All they did was play space checkers.

57:35.745 --> 57:37.539
Plus, it turns out the hairy one's a dude.

57:37.789 --> 57:39.332
And the metal one too. All dudes.

57:39.582 --> 57:41.543
But won't they notice
their hyperdrive is missing?

57:41.793 --> 57:44.879
Come on, Chewie, hit the hyperdrive.

57:47.423 --> 57:49.008
Nah, they'll be fine.

57:53.471 --> 57:56.808
All right, we need a red four-piece
unit over at the...

57:57.058 --> 57:57.642
Unikitty...

57:57.892 --> 58:00.979
you're supposed to follow
the instructions, remember?

58:01.229 --> 58:01.855
Sorry.

58:02.105 --> 58:03.356
Ugh, this gives me the jeebies.

58:03.606 --> 58:05.150
What do I even...? I can't...!

58:08.361 --> 58:09.529
Nice!

58:11.072 --> 58:12.490
We pilot the ship to the
service entrance...

58:12.740 --> 58:14.659
so we can get past the dangerous...

58:14.909 --> 58:16.286
but also kind of cool...

58:16.536 --> 58:17.579
laser gate.

58:18.621 --> 58:19.621
Space ID.

58:19.664 --> 58:20.664
I have a drive-on.

58:20.832 --> 58:22.041
Who are you here to see?

58:22.292 --> 58:23.710
I'm here to see Your Butt.

58:23.960 --> 58:26.337
Is that last name "Butt,"
first name "Your," or is it...?

58:26.588 --> 58:27.588
Oh, my gosh!

58:30.258 --> 58:32.927
Pow. Wham. Ka-zap.

58:37.265 --> 58:38.308
First try!

58:39.517 --> 58:42.645
Step three."
We break into Lord Business' office...

58:42.896 --> 58:45.315
and we'll plunder his collection
of relics for disguises.

58:46.274 --> 58:47.274
Step four:

58:47.317 --> 58:48.526
Benny and Metal Beard...

58:48.776 --> 58:50.069
will sneak their way
into the master control room.

58:50.320 --> 58:52.405
Motion sensors triggered in Sector 12.

58:52.655 --> 58:53.655
10-4.

58:54.073 --> 58:55.073
Uh-oh.

58:59.037 --> 59:01.206
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Oh!

59:01.456 --> 59:02.665
Do it.

59:07.253 --> 59:08.453
Metal Beard, that was awesome!

59:08.630 --> 59:10.340
First law of the sea...

59:10.590 --> 59:13.760
never place your rear end
on a pirate's face.

59:14.010 --> 59:16.137
Once inside,
they'll use their technical know-how...

59:16.387 --> 59:17.667
to disable the Kragle shield.

59:17.889 --> 59:18.889
I am the computer.

59:19.098 --> 59:21.267
Cool! Talking computer.

59:21.517 --> 59:24.687
Please disable the shield systems.

59:24.938 --> 59:26.064
Of course.

59:26.564 --> 59:28.691
There are no movies
in your area with that title.

59:31.069 --> 59:33.363
Vitruvius will provide lookout
and make sure we're not being followed.

59:33.613 --> 59:34.739
Okay.

59:35.365 --> 59:37.951
Batman and Unikitty go
into the boardroom...

59:38.201 --> 59:40.453
to make one last change
to Lord Business' plan.

59:40.703 --> 59:43.456
I move that we freeze the universe.
Can I get a second on that?

59:43.706 --> 59:44.374
BRUCE I second.

59:44.624 --> 59:47.085
Bruce Wayne, CEO of Wayne Enterprises.

59:47.335 --> 59:49.921
Bruce Wayne? Uh, who's that?

59:50.171 --> 59:52.382
Sounds like a cool guy.

59:54.384 --> 59:55.824
We'd like to invest in your company.

59:55.843 --> 59:58.388
Your weapon to control
the universe sounds super sweet...

59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.807
- ...I must say.
- It is, indeed, super sweet.

01:00:01.057 --> 01:00:03.559
Cool. What kind of sound system
does it have?

01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:06.604
Uh, sound system?
Well, I mean, we have an iPod Shuffle.

01:00:06.854 --> 01:00:07.854
Wait a second.

01:00:08.022 --> 01:00:09.899
You're telling me you have
a machine to control the universe...

01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:12.149
and you can't listen to tunes
in surround sound?

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.360
Embarrassing.

01:00:13.528 --> 01:00:14.528
Well, I mean...

01:00:14.737 --> 01:00:16.938
we need to get that done.
I want eight-foot speakers.

01:00:17.073 --> 01:00:17.740
Great call.

01:00:17.991 --> 01:00:21.035
Yeah, I want speakers that you can hug
with your arms and your legs...

01:00:21.286 --> 01:00:22.829
and just feel the beat.

01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:27.417
Listen up! We need new instructions
for a speaker system for the TAKOS.

01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:28.667
We'll never help.

01:00:28.835 --> 01:00:29.836
Whatever you say, boss.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.560
Then once the instructions are printed...

01:00:32.714 --> 01:00:34.799
Wyldstyle and I
will enter the Kragle room...

01:00:35.049 --> 01:00:36.801
place the thing on the other thing...

01:00:37.051 --> 01:00:38.845
and save the universe.

01:00:39.095 --> 01:00:41.615
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, I didn't draw that.
Is that me exploding?

01:00:41.848 --> 01:00:43.349
Uh, I didn't mention that earlier?

01:00:43.599 --> 01:00:46.477
When you reunite the Piece
with the Kragle, it might explode?

01:00:46.728 --> 01:00:48.521
No! But it might not, right?

01:00:49.689 --> 01:00:52.150
Sure, sure, sure. Let's go with that.

01:00:52.567 --> 01:00:55.028
Attention, everybody!
Incoming speaker delivery!

01:01:03.578 --> 01:01:04.704
Ow!

01:01:05.496 --> 01:01:06.496
Who are you two?

01:01:06.664 --> 01:01:08.875
We are transfers from downstairs.

01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:10.125
- What?
- Excuse me?

01:01:10.293 --> 01:01:13.046
Your robot voice
sounds an awful lot like a human voice.

01:01:13.296 --> 01:01:15.298
Give me a break.
I've never been a robot before.

01:01:15.548 --> 01:01:17.592
What do you mean?
You have always been a robot!

01:01:17.842 --> 01:01:19.719
No, no, no, do not listen to her.

01:01:19.969 --> 01:01:21.721
What are your robot serial numbers?

01:01:28.603 --> 01:01:29.937
Everything is awesome

01:01:30.938 --> 01:01:32.648
No way. This is my jam.

01:01:32.899 --> 01:01:34.484
This is also my jam.

01:01:34.734 --> 01:01:36.444
Everything is awesome

01:01:36.694 --> 01:01:38.821
Everything is cool
When you're part of a team

01:01:39.072 --> 01:01:41.753
- Needs great harmonies.
- I don't want to sing the song. I'm not...

01:01:41.949 --> 01:01:44.243
Everything is awesome

01:01:44.911 --> 01:01:47.914
Everything is cool
When you're part of a team

01:01:48.164 --> 01:01:50.500
Everything is awesome

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:53.419
When we're living our dream

01:01:54.003 --> 01:01:55.046
Quick, let's go.

01:01:55.296 --> 01:01:56.547
Everything is awesome

01:01:56.798 --> 01:01:58.508
Hmm, I thought you didn't like that song.

01:01:58.758 --> 01:01:59.758
I don't.

01:02:00.218 --> 01:02:01.427
Mm-hm.

01:02:02.762 --> 01:02:04.263
I know you put on this tough act...

01:02:04.514 --> 01:02:05.973
but I don't think you're as mean
as you're trying to seem.

01:02:06.224 --> 01:02:07.558
I'm not mean. What are you talking about?

01:02:07.809 --> 01:02:10.561
I'm just saying, you were all,
"He's not The Special, Vitruvius.

01:02:10.812 --> 01:02:13.606
He can't possibly be The Special.
This guy? Are you kidding me?"

01:02:15.066 --> 01:02:17.318
Anyways, I don't think that's you.

01:02:17.652 --> 01:02:19.237
The real you, anyway.

01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:29.122
Look, Emmet.

01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:32.458
I wanted it to be me, okay?

01:02:33.668 --> 01:02:35.253
I wanted to be The Special.

01:02:35.878 --> 01:02:39.382
And I know that sounds super mature.
It's just...

01:02:39.966 --> 01:02:43.136
ever since I heard the prophecy,
I wanted to be the One.

01:02:44.262 --> 01:02:46.639
I was right there in that
construction site...

01:02:47.265 --> 01:02:49.308
right on top of it, and then...

01:02:50.893 --> 01:02:52.270
it turned out to be you.

01:02:58.985 --> 01:03:02.071
That night in the city,
when you thought I was The Special...

01:03:05.366 --> 01:03:08.411
and you said I was talented
and important...

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:12.623
that was the first time anyone
had ever really told me that.

01:03:13.708 --> 01:03:15.468
And it made me
wanna do everything I could...

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:17.545
to be the guy you were talking about.

01:03:21.132 --> 01:03:22.132
Lucy.

01:03:22.216 --> 01:03:23.384
What?

01:03:24.051 --> 01:03:25.887
That was my real name.

01:03:26.137 --> 01:03:28.681
You asked earlier, and it's...

01:03:29.891 --> 01:03:31.058
."Lucy.

01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:36.063
I really like that name.

01:03:40.003 --> 01:03:41.003
Hey)'-

01:03:41.027 --> 01:03:42.945
- What are you two losers talking about?
- Huh? What? Oh, nothing.

01:03:43.196 --> 01:03:45.948
Thought I'd help you guys.
Left the weird cat thing to stall.

01:03:46.199 --> 01:03:48.242
Business, business, business. Numbers.

01:03:48.493 --> 01:03:50.161
- Is this working?
- Yes.

01:03:50.411 --> 01:03:51.411
Yay!

01:03:51.412 --> 01:03:52.705
There's Bad Cop.

01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:56.542
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes...

01:03:56.792 --> 01:03:58.544
Okay. Wait for my signal.

01:03:58.794 --> 01:04:00.213
Good luck, Emmet.

01:04:00.713 --> 01:04:01.714
Lucy.

01:04:03.007 --> 01:04:04.675
I guess this might be goodbye.

01:04:05.218 --> 01:04:08.304
I don't like goodbyes.
Let's just call this:

01:04:08.763 --> 01:04:10.640
"See you later, alligator."

01:04:11.307 --> 01:04:13.518
"See you later, alligator"?

01:04:15.436 --> 01:04:17.522
After a while, crocodile.

01:04:20.775 --> 01:04:21.775
Who's Lucy?

01:04:21.984 --> 01:04:23.545
Batman, when we get inside this room...

01:04:23.653 --> 01:04:25.112
there are gonna be
audio sensors everywhere.

01:04:25.363 --> 01:04:27.240
We have to be really, really quiet.

01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:30.409
Don't worry, Dad, I read your dumb
instructions. Stop yelling at me.

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:31.953
Benny, what's our status with the shield?

01:04:32.203 --> 01:04:33.443
Oh, yeah, no, it's going great.

01:04:33.579 --> 01:04:35.957
It's just going great,
if somebody would listen to me!

01:04:36.207 --> 01:04:38.334
Downloading latest episode
of Where Are My Pants?

01:04:38.584 --> 01:04:41.087
Where are you
getting "pants" from? You know what I want!

01:04:41.337 --> 01:04:42.380
The pipes are calling...

01:04:43.316 --> 01:04:44.316
Bad Cop.

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.133
Hi, this is Lord Business' assistant.

01:04:46.384 --> 01:04:48.424
He would like you to come
to his office immediately.

01:04:48.553 --> 01:04:49.178
Copy that.

01:04:49.428 --> 01:04:51.264
- Thanks.
- You are welcome, sir.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.601
Hey, who is that?

01:04:58.854 --> 01:04:59.855
That's the signal...

01:05:00.106 --> 01:05:02.024
but the shield is still up.

01:05:02.275 --> 01:05:03.609
We'll wing it.

01:05:04.777 --> 01:05:06.612
That's a bat pun.

01:05:08.864 --> 01:05:09.865
Shh. Benny...

01:05:10.116 --> 01:05:11.576
disable the shield.

01:05:11.826 --> 01:05:12.907
- Disable the shield.
- Now.

01:05:13.119 --> 01:05:14.161
Disable the shield.

01:05:14.412 --> 01:05:16.172
- Searching for Albanian restaurants.
- What?

01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:19.170
- No! I never once said anything...!
- I don't understand what you mean.

01:05:19.542 --> 01:05:20.668
Disable the shield!

01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:21.918
Benny, what's going on?

01:05:22.128 --> 01:05:23.588
Disable the shield! Come on!

01:05:23.838 --> 01:05:25.298
You are undermining me!

01:05:25.548 --> 01:05:27.383
Which phrase
would you like me to underline?

01:05:27.633 --> 01:05:28.676
Disable the shield!

01:05:28.926 --> 01:05:30.136
Let me try.

01:05:30.469 --> 01:05:34.473
Be ye disabling of yon shield.

01:05:34.724 --> 01:05:35.433
Disabling shield.

01:05:35.683 --> 01:05:36.683
What?

01:05:40.271 --> 01:05:42.815
Okay, in three...

01:05:44.525 --> 01:05:45.525
two...

01:05:46.986 --> 01:05:47.987
one.

01:05:49.322 --> 01:05:50.781
Let's do this.

01:05:52.158 --> 01:05:53.158
Lucy!

01:05:56.287 --> 01:05:57.287
Lucy!

01:05:58.581 --> 01:05:59.582
No!

01:06:01.125 --> 01:06:02.460
Oh, man.

01:06:02.835 --> 01:06:03.919
Oh, no.

01:06:04.503 --> 01:06:05.503
Uh-oh.

01:06:05.504 --> 01:06:08.257
Sneaking around the corner...

01:06:10.051 --> 01:06:11.844
- Unh!
- Vitruvius.

01:06:12.094 --> 01:06:15.514
I see you've accidentally
wandered into my Think Tank.

01:06:15.765 --> 01:06:17.933
And by the way,
I found a few of your friends.

01:06:18.184 --> 01:06:21.062
- By which I mean all of them!
- Sorry!

01:06:21.312 --> 01:06:22.980
Acceptable work, Bad Cop.

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:23.898
Thank you, sir.

01:06:24.148 --> 01:06:26.734
Robots, destroy this old man at once.

01:06:26.984 --> 01:06:28.277
Did you just call me "old"?

01:06:28.527 --> 01:06:29.737
Yeah. So what?

01:06:30.488 --> 01:06:33.532
Well, Junebug, I really prefer the word...

01:06:33.783 --> 01:06:34.784
"experienced"!

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.800
Aha.

01:06:51.842 --> 01:06:52.842
You see, Emmet?

01:06:52.885 --> 01:06:56.097
A corrupted spirit is no match
for the purity of imagina...

01:06:59.767 --> 01:07:00.851
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Vitruvius!

01:07:01.102 --> 01:07:02.561
No!

01:07:04.897 --> 01:07:05.898
Vitruvius.

01:07:07.149 --> 01:07:10.069
My sweet Emmet. Come closer.

01:07:10.361 --> 01:07:12.655
You must know something
about the prophecy.

01:07:12.905 --> 01:07:14.657
I know, I'm doing my best...

01:07:14.907 --> 01:07:15.616
but I don't...

01:07:15.866 --> 01:07:17.284
The prophecy...

01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:19.036
I made it up.

01:07:19.537 --> 01:07:20.579
What?

01:07:21.122 --> 01:07:23.791
I made it up. It's not true.

01:07:24.667 --> 01:07:26.293
But that means I'm just...

01:07:26.794 --> 01:07:28.295
I'm not The Special?

01:07:28.838 --> 01:07:29.838
You must listen.

01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:32.258
What I'm about to tell you...

01:07:32.508 --> 01:07:35.136
will change the course of history.

01:07:39.473 --> 01:07:40.808
No.

01:07:41.559 --> 01:07:42.643
No.

01:07:51.402 --> 01:07:52.403
Hey.

01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:54.321
Not so special anymore, huh?

01:07:56.949 --> 01:07:57.992
Well, guess what.

01:07:58.242 --> 01:08:00.536
No one ever told me I was special.

01:08:00.786 --> 01:08:04.123
I never got a trophy just for showing up!

01:08:04.373 --> 01:08:07.543
I'm not some special little snowflake...

01:08:07.793 --> 01:08:08.793
“HO.

01:08:09.003 --> 01:08:11.130
But as unspecial as I am...

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:14.425
you are a thousand-billion times...

01:08:14.675 --> 01:08:16.135
more unspecial than me.

01:08:16.385 --> 01:08:19.471
Robots, bring me the Sword of Exact Zero.

01:08:19.721 --> 01:08:21.015
Yes, Lord Business.

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:23.225
It must be weird.

01:08:23.475 --> 01:08:27.188
One minute, you're the most
special person in the universe.

01:08:27.438 --> 01:08:30.483
And the next minute, you're nobody.

01:08:33.068 --> 01:08:35.654
Oh, I have a nice spot
for this in my relic room.

01:08:36.363 --> 01:08:37.990
Uh-oh! My mistake!

01:08:38.491 --> 01:08:39.700
There it goes!

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:40.451
No!

01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:42.661
Bye-bye forever!

01:08:42.912 --> 01:08:46.707
Well, I guess
there's only one thing left to do!

01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:50.586
Release the Kragle!

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:53.839
- Computer!
- Yes, sir.

01:08:54.089 --> 01:08:56.091
Set the electric shocker
to 100 Mississippi.

01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:57.341
<i>No problem.</i>

01:08:57.343 --> 01:08:59.386
- Then terminate everyone.
- Already on it.

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:01.596
Emmet, that should give you enough time...

01:09:01.846 --> 01:09:03.727
to witness the first
location to be Kragled.

01:09:03.933 --> 01:09:05.434
- Your hometown.
- No!

01:09:05.684 --> 01:09:08.395
Bad Cop, unfortunately,
I'm gonna have to leave you here to die.

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:09.729
What? Sir.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.482
It's not personal.

01:09:11.732 --> 01:09:13.651
It's just business.

01:09:14.193 --> 01:09:16.237
Lord Business.

01:09:16.487 --> 01:09:17.738
Ciao.

01:09:19.323 --> 01:09:21.283
Beginning zapping termination...

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:23.202
in 99 Mississippi...

01:09:23.452 --> 01:09:25.203
98 Mississippi...

01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:27.206
97 Mississippi...

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:28.957
and so on.

01:09:48.602 --> 01:09:50.395
Attention, everyone.

01:09:51.313 --> 01:09:53.314
This is President Business.

01:09:54.817 --> 01:09:55.817
Hello.

01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:57.862
- Hi, welcome to Taco Tuesday!
- Whoa.

01:09:58.571 --> 01:10:00.698
Don't worry about this big black...

01:10:00.948 --> 01:10:02.867
monolith thing that's
blocking out the sun.

01:10:03.617 --> 01:10:04.857
What you need to worry about...

01:10:05.077 --> 01:10:07.496
is this question that
I'm about to ask you:

01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:10.124
Who wants a taco?

01:10:13.085 --> 01:10:14.461
Yeah! I know!

01:10:14.712 --> 01:10:17.131
Tacos, tacos! We're going crazy! Yeah.

01:10:17.631 --> 01:10:19.216
All right, everyone.

01:10:19.466 --> 01:10:20.843
Act normal.

01:10:22.845 --> 01:10:23.929
Perfect.

01:10:24.179 --> 01:10:26.765
Now, everybody say "Freeze!"

01:10:30.311 --> 01:10:33.480
So I guess running around
and screaming is normal.

01:10:33.731 --> 01:10:36.317
Micro-managers,
commence micro-management.

01:10:36.567 --> 01:10:38.986
Commencing micro-management.

01:10:40.988 --> 01:10:43.073
What's going on? I can't move!

01:10:45.409 --> 01:10:48.162
Please, please! Won't somebody help us?

01:10:48.412 --> 01:10:52.291
Emmet, you'll think of something,
right? Like you always do.

01:10:53.334 --> 01:10:54.960
Didn't you hear him?

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:57.004
The prophecy's made-up.

01:10:58.088 --> 01:10:59.798
I'm not The Special.

01:11:00.799 --> 01:11:03.510
And to think for a moment
I thought I might be.

01:11:05.471 --> 01:11:07.890
- Emmet.
- Who said that?

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:09.391
I did.

01:11:09.642 --> 01:11:12.436
I am Ghost Vitruvius.

01:11:12.686 --> 01:11:15.522
Woo!

01:11:16.023 --> 01:11:18.734
Emmet, you didn't let me finish earlier.

01:11:18.984 --> 01:11:20.361
Because I died.

01:11:20.611 --> 01:11:22.237
The reason I made up the prophecy...

01:11:22.488 --> 01:11:24.949
was because I knew that
whoever found the Piece...

01:11:25.199 --> 01:11:26.825
could become The Special.

01:11:27.076 --> 01:11:29.745
Because the only thing
anyone needs to be special...

01:11:29.995 --> 01:11:32.539
is to believe that you can be.

01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:36.251
I know that sounds like a cat poster,
but it's true.

01:11:37.044 --> 01:11:40.547
Look at what you did
when you believed you were special.

01:11:40.798 --> 01:11:43.217
You just need to believe it some more.

01:11:43.467 --> 01:11:46.720
But how can I just decide
to believe that I'm special...

01:11:46.971 --> 01:11:48.013
when I'm not?

01:11:49.348 --> 01:11:52.059
Because the world depends on it.

01:11:54.103 --> 01:11:56.939
Woo!

01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:59.900
Zapping termination in 35 Mississippi...

01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:00.734
What?

01:12:00.985 --> 01:12:02.111
34 Mississippi...

01:12:02.987 --> 01:12:04.113
33 Mississippi...

01:12:04.989 --> 01:12:06.323
32 Mississippi...

01:12:06.991 --> 01:12:08.909
31 Mississippi...

01:12:09.702 --> 01:12:10.702
30 Mississippi...

01:12:10.828 --> 01:12:12.663
29 Mississippi...

01:12:12.913 --> 01:12:15.165
28 Mississippi, 27 Mississippi...

01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:18.710
26 Mississippi...

01:12:18.919 --> 01:12:21.255
25 Mississippi...

01:12:21.505 --> 01:12:22.505
24 Mississippi...

01:12:30.639 --> 01:12:31.765
Emmet!

01:12:32.016 --> 01:12:33.016
What are you...?

01:12:33.183 --> 01:12:34.643
18 Mississippi...

01:12:34.893 --> 01:12:36.979
- ...17 Mississippi...
- Oh!

01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:38.731
- ...16 Mississippi...
- Lucy!

01:12:38.981 --> 01:12:40.822
- ...15 Mississippi...
- Wait! What are you...?

01:12:40.899 --> 01:12:42.776
Now it's your turn to be the hero.

01:12:43.027 --> 01:12:44.653
- 13 Mississippi...
- No!

01:12:44.903 --> 01:12:46.363
12 Mississippi...

01:12:46.613 --> 01:12:48.282
See you later, alligator.

01:12:48.532 --> 01:12:49.532
Don't!

01:12:51.577 --> 01:12:53.162
No, Emmet!

01:12:53.412 --> 01:12:55.664
- Aah!
- 7 Mississippi...

01:12:55.914 --> 01:12:57.291
6 Mississippi...

01:12:57.666 --> 01:12:59.376
5 Mississippi...

01:12:59.626 --> 01:13:00.919
4 Mississippi...

01:13:01.545 --> 01:13:02.921
3 Mississippi...

01:13:03.547 --> 01:13:04.631
2 Mississippi...

01:13:05.758 --> 01:13:06.758
1 Mississippi...

01:13:07.301 --> 01:13:08.719
0 Missi... Error.

01:13:08.969 --> 01:13:10.471
Termination failure.

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:12.430
Emmet!

01:13:19.730 --> 01:13:21.106
No.

01:13:27.154 --> 01:13:29.740
He... He saved us.

01:13:30.866 --> 01:13:32.242
Well, what do we do now?

01:13:32.493 --> 01:13:33.814
There's gotta be a bright side...

01:13:34.036 --> 01:13:34.745
here somewhere.

01:13:34.995 --> 01:13:36.538
Does anyone have any ideas?

01:13:37.456 --> 01:13:38.999
Emmet had ideas.

01:13:39.249 --> 01:13:43.253
Arr, if only there were more people
in the world like he.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.134
Maybe there are.

01:13:49.593 --> 01:13:51.178
Meet me downstairs in 10 seconds.

01:13:53.263 --> 01:13:55.182
Honey, where are my...

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:57.226
pant“?

01:13:57.726 --> 01:13:58.769
- Hi!
- Hey, guess what.

01:13:59.019 --> 01:14:01.438
Found your pants. Series is over. Benny...

01:14:01.688 --> 01:14:03.941
send this out to
everyone in the universe.

01:14:04.191 --> 01:14:05.943
1980-something technology?

01:14:06.193 --> 01:14:07.569
Now you're talking!

01:14:10.489 --> 01:14:13.367
Uh... Ahem. Hey, everybody.

01:14:13.617 --> 01:14:17.204
You don't know me,
but I'm on TV, so you can trust me.

01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:19.915
I know things seem kind of bad right now.

01:14:20.415 --> 01:14:22.584
But there is a way out of this.

01:14:23.585 --> 01:14:25.087
This is Emmet.

01:14:25.587 --> 01:14:27.464
And he was just like all of you.

01:14:27.714 --> 01:14:29.174
A face in the crowd...

01:14:29.424 --> 01:14:31.468
following the same instructions as you.

01:14:32.261 --> 01:14:35.055
He was so good at fitting in,
no one ever saw him.

01:14:35.722 --> 01:14:37.307
And I owe you an apology...

01:14:37.808 --> 01:14:39.935
because I used to look down
on people like that.

01:14:40.185 --> 01:14:42.855
"I used to think they were followers...

01:14:43.105 --> 01:14:45.691
with no ideas or vision."

01:14:45.941 --> 01:14:48.235
Because it turns out Emmet had great ideas.

01:14:48.485 --> 01:14:50.612
And even though they seemed weird...

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:52.861
and kind of pointless...

01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:54.533
they actually came closer...

01:14:54.783 --> 01:14:57.286
than anyone else to saving the universe.

01:14:57.619 --> 01:15:00.455
And now we have to finish
what he started...

01:15:00.706 --> 01:15:04.042
by making whatever weird thing
pops into our heads.

01:15:04.293 --> 01:15:07.337
All of you have the ability
inside of you to be a groundbreaker.

01:15:07.588 --> 01:15:08.797
And I mean literally!

01:15:09.673 --> 01:15:10.924
Break the ground!

01:15:11.175 --> 01:15:12.175
Peel up the pieces...

01:15:12.342 --> 01:15:13.343
tear apart your walls!

01:15:13.594 --> 01:15:15.304
Build things only you could build.

01:15:15.554 --> 01:15:16.680
Defend yourselves.

01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:19.600
We need to fight back
against President Business'...

01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:21.852
plans to freeze us!

01:15:22.311 --> 01:15:25.022
Today will not be known as Taco Tuesday.

01:15:25.522 --> 01:15:28.567
It will be known as Freedom Friday!

01:15:30.694 --> 01:15:32.487
But still on a Tuesday!

01:15:39.244 --> 01:15:40.913
End of the line.

01:15:43.665 --> 01:15:44.750
Bad Cop?

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.085
I hope there's still a Good Cop
in me somewhere.

01:15:48.962 --> 01:15:52.883
I'll hold these guys off.
You go stop them. Yay!

01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:55.552
Great idea, but how will we get there?

01:15:55.802 --> 01:15:57.679
T-minus one.

01:15:57.930 --> 01:16:00.182
Ten, nine, eight...

01:16:00.432 --> 01:16:01.793
- ...seven, six...
- I could, uh...

01:16:02.517 --> 01:16:04.037
- ...five, four...
- I could build a...

01:16:04.686 --> 01:16:05.686
three, two, one.

01:16:06.313 --> 01:16:07.689
I could build a spaceship!

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:11.693
You're not gonna say no?

01:16:11.944 --> 01:16:13.695
Build away, whatever your name is.

01:16:13.946 --> 01:16:15.405
- Whoa! Yay!
- Ha-ha-ha!

01:16:18.158 --> 01:16:20.244
Okay. Spaceship! Spaceship!

01:16:23.205 --> 01:16:24.205
Spaceship!

01:16:25.666 --> 01:16:26.666
Spaceship!

01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:27.542
Spaceship!

01:16:27.793 --> 01:16:28.793
Spaceship!

01:16:29.002 --> 01:16:30.170
Spaceship!

01:16:30.879 --> 01:16:31.879
Spaceship!

01:16:32.130 --> 01:16:32.631
Spaceship!

01:16:32.881 --> 01:16:34.341
All units, attack that spaceship.

01:16:36.134 --> 01:16:37.134
Spaceship!

01:16:38.239 --> 01:16:39.239
Where'd he go?

01:16:39.263 --> 01:16:40.263
Spaceship!

01:16:43.141 --> 01:16:44.184
Wyldstyle, look...

01:16:44.434 --> 01:16:46.561
it's the citizens!

01:16:52.109 --> 01:16:53.527
Tallyho!

01:16:54.152 --> 01:16:55.445
Yee-haw!

01:16:55.696 --> 01:16:58.156
And don't forget us MasterBuilders.

01:16:58.407 --> 01:17:00.284
What is going on?

01:17:00.534 --> 01:17:01.743
You stop...

01:17:01.994 --> 01:17:03.078
building that stuff!

01:17:03.328 --> 01:17:04.413
Just stop it!

01:17:08.644 --> 01:17:09.644
Great job!

01:17:09.668 --> 01:17:10.752
This might actually work.

01:17:11.003 --> 01:17:13.964
'Twas your speech
which roused this hearty crew.

01:17:15.090 --> 01:17:16.925
If only Emmet were here to see this.

01:17:17.175 --> 01:17:19.344
He'd say something adorable like...

01:17:23.724 --> 01:17:25.976
Am I just gonna keep...

01:17:26.226 --> 01:17:27.227
falling...

01:17:28.228 --> 01:17:31.189
forever?

01:17:42.492 --> 01:17:44.161
Is this another vision?

01:17:46.913 --> 01:17:47.998
Where am I?

01:17:49.041 --> 01:17:52.127
Is that the Office Tower?

01:17:58.675 --> 01:17:59.675
Bricksburg!

01:18:01.303 --> 01:18:02.304
What was that?

01:18:04.848 --> 01:18:05.848
No, no, no.

01:18:05.974 --> 01:18:06.974
<i>No!</i>

01:18:09.019 --> 01:18:10.562
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship!

01:18:10.812 --> 01:18:13.106
- Pew!
- What in the world is that?

01:18:15.233 --> 01:18:17.361
It's adorable.

01:18:20.238 --> 01:18:21.531
Uh-oh.

01:18:21.782 --> 01:18:23.784
No. No. Whoa, no, no, no.

01:18:24.034 --> 01:18:25.314
Hey, don't eat me. Don't eat me.

01:18:25.410 --> 01:18:26.828
Do not eat me. Please.

01:18:27.412 --> 01:18:28.747
Hi, Emmet.

01:18:29.664 --> 01:18:30.957
Uh...

01:18:31.208 --> 01:18:32.626
Hi?

01:18:35.712 --> 01:18:38.048
Is this The Man...?

01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:47.057
The Man Upstairs?

01:18:54.731 --> 01:18:56.024
What happened?

01:18:57.025 --> 01:18:59.403
No, no, no, this is a disaster.

01:19:00.362 --> 01:19:03.031
Why...? Why...? What? What?

01:19:03.281 --> 01:19:04.281
What?

01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:08.286
Why is the dragon on top
of the luxury condo development?

01:19:08.787 --> 01:19:09.871
But I was just playing...

01:19:10.372 --> 01:19:11.706
I know it's hard to understand...

01:19:11.957 --> 01:19:14.084
but this is Dad's stuff, okay?

01:19:14.376 --> 01:19:16.628
All of this that you see before you...

01:19:16.878 --> 01:19:18.630
is all your father's.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.757
And everything is thought-out very...

01:19:21.466 --> 01:19:22.506
What did you do down here?

01:19:22.551 --> 01:19:24.071
Did you take the top off of the tower?

01:19:24.553 --> 01:19:25.887
It was an accident.

01:19:26.138 --> 01:19:28.515
You accidentally...

01:19:28.765 --> 01:19:30.183
expertly...

01:19:30.434 --> 01:19:33.270
carefully took the entire top
off of that tower?

01:19:33.956 --> 01:19:34.956
Yes.

01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:36.648
You know the rules. This isn't a toy.

01:19:37.023 --> 01:19:39.609
- Um, well, it kind of is.
- No.

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:43.363
Actually, it's a highly sophisticated
interlocking brick system.

01:19:43.613 --> 01:19:45.866
- But we bought it at the toy store.
- We did.

01:19:46.116 --> 01:19:49.119
But the way I'm using it
makes it an adult thing.

01:19:49.369 --> 01:19:51.371
The box for this one said ages 8 to 14.

01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:55.625
That's a suggestion.
They have to put that on there.

01:19:55.876 --> 01:19:59.087
You can't expect me to be able
to resist playing with all this.

01:19:59.337 --> 01:20:01.590
You have your stuff over near
the Christmas decorations.

01:20:02.174 --> 01:20:04.259
All those bricks,
you can build anything you want.

01:20:07.971 --> 01:20:11.224
Finn, we're gonna play a little game.
It's called:

01:20:11.475 --> 01:20:14.269
"Let's Put Everything Back
the Way You Found it."

01:20:14.519 --> 01:20:16.021
But, Dad, you don't understand.

01:20:16.271 --> 01:20:19.357
So I can make things
the way they're supposed to be.

01:20:22.611 --> 01:20:24.029
Permanently.

01:20:27.115 --> 01:20:28.366
More Kragles?

01:20:28.617 --> 01:20:31.119
This rebellion ends right now.

01:20:31.369 --> 01:20:32.746
Commencing...

01:20:32.996 --> 01:20:34.164
micro-management.

01:20:38.710 --> 01:20:40.337
Oh, no. No!

01:20:45.467 --> 01:20:47.010
Ha, ha! Fire in the hole!

01:20:51.431 --> 01:20:52.431
Wait, what's happening?

01:20:52.641 --> 01:20:55.310
No, wait! No, we're going down! Mayday!

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.937
<i>No!</i>

01:20:58.355 --> 01:20:59.355
Meow. Meow.

01:20:59.564 --> 01:21:01.399
Hold on, Jeff. We're coming for you!

01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:02.359
No!

01:21:02.609 --> 01:21:03.609
Stop!

01:21:03.944 --> 01:21:04.944
Oh, no!

01:21:14.287 --> 01:21:16.164
Arr, there be too many Micro-managers!

01:21:16.414 --> 01:21:17.707
What am I holding here?

01:21:17.958 --> 01:21:20.794
- It's a battleship.
- No, it's a hodgepodge. That's what it is.

01:21:21.044 --> 01:21:22.254
What's Batman doing on it?

01:21:23.088 --> 01:21:24.422
What is this, a robot pirate?

01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:26.590
Dang it.

01:21:27.801 --> 01:21:29.122
Stop! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop!

01:21:29.344 --> 01:21:31.346
You got glue all over
that construction worker.

01:21:32.806 --> 01:21:34.808
Here. Give that to me.

01:21:35.559 --> 01:21:37.561
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

01:21:37.811 --> 01:21:39.451
All of those are my friends! No, stop it!

01:21:39.604 --> 01:21:42.691
Ye were a hearty crew. But it be...

01:21:43.525 --> 01:21:45.277
It be over.

01:21:45.527 --> 01:21:47.362
No!

01:21:50.198 --> 01:21:51.533
The Piece of Resistance!

01:21:51.783 --> 01:21:53.285
I can still save them!

01:21:53.535 --> 01:21:56.955
Let's get this gunk
off this construction worker.

01:21:57.205 --> 01:21:59.499
He's not just a construction worker, Dad.
He's the hero.

01:21:59.749 --> 01:22:01.418
Nope, he's not.

01:22:01.668 --> 01:22:04.254
He is a ordinary, regular...

01:22:04.504 --> 01:22:06.089
generic construction worker...

01:22:06.339 --> 01:22:09.050
and I need to put him back
where he belongs.

01:22:10.302 --> 01:22:13.179
Now, where is my X-Acto knife?

01:22:16.016 --> 01:22:18.643
I gotta get the Piece of Resistance.

01:22:19.394 --> 01:22:22.522
If I could get the attention
of the smaller creature.

01:22:23.273 --> 01:22:24.357
I gotta move.

01:22:24.608 --> 01:22:26.735
Where is that?

01:22:26.985 --> 01:22:28.778
Move!

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.413
All right.

01:23:00.435 --> 01:23:01.435
Move!

01:23:06.608 --> 01:23:07.942
Now, I didn't move...

01:23:12.197 --> 01:23:13.197
OW.

01:23:15.575 --> 01:23:16.868
- Uh, Dad?
- Yeah.

01:23:17.118 --> 01:23:20.080
I think I saw the X-Acto over there
near Middle Zealand.

01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:21.665
Oh, great. Thank you.

01:23:21.915 --> 01:23:23.083
Welcome.

01:23:30.924 --> 01:23:32.509
It's up to you now, Emmet.

01:23:42.394 --> 01:23:43.728
Believe.

01:23:44.979 --> 01:23:47.399
I know that sounds like a cat poster...

01:23:47.649 --> 01:23:49.234
but it's true.

01:23:56.366 --> 01:23:58.493
Whoa!

01:24:11.297 --> 01:24:12.298
Sorry, street.

01:24:18.221 --> 01:24:19.514
Ho-ho!

01:24:24.644 --> 01:24:27.397
I can see everything.

01:24:30.836 --> 01:24:31.836
Ha, ha!

01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:33.319
What the heck is this?

01:24:33.570 --> 01:24:35.613
I am a MasterBuilder.

01:24:38.324 --> 01:24:41.035
Release every Micro-manager we have!

01:24:41.286 --> 01:24:42.871
Let's get him, fellas!

01:24:46.875 --> 01:24:48.042
Hey, everyone!

01:24:48.293 --> 01:24:50.170
- Emmet!
- Emmet! Yay!

01:24:53.173 --> 01:24:55.717
Lucy, I'm going inside that thing.

01:24:56.259 --> 01:24:57.259
You've got it, Emmet.

01:24:57.469 --> 01:25:00.013
Take that! Ha, ha!

01:25:00.263 --> 01:25:01.431
Good night! Come here!

01:25:01.681 --> 01:25:03.308
We'll help you out, kid.

01:25:03.558 --> 01:25:06.060
Here's how we do it pirate-style!

01:25:08.772 --> 01:25:09.772
Yes! Emmet! That's it!

01:25:12.901 --> 01:25:13.901
Take him down, boys!

01:25:17.655 --> 01:25:18.656
Emmet!

01:25:21.242 --> 01:25:22.869
Stay positive.

01:25:23.995 --> 01:25:25.163
They're tearing me apart!

01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.791
Stay positive.

01:25:28.208 --> 01:25:29.208
Come on!

01:25:29.334 --> 01:25:30.752
Oh, forget it!

01:25:36.299 --> 01:25:38.968
You all need to be more friendly!

01:25:41.596 --> 01:25:42.597
Emmet, go!

01:25:42.847 --> 01:25:43.932
Go! Now's your...

01:25:44.182 --> 01:25:45.558
- ...chance!
- She's right!

01:25:45.809 --> 01:25:48.645
- You can do it, me laddie!
- Go on, kid. Get in there!

01:25:56.319 --> 01:25:57.319
Sir, we got an intrud...!

01:25:59.239 --> 01:26:00.365
Lord Business.

01:26:00.615 --> 01:26:02.283
Back from the dead, Brickowski?

01:26:02.534 --> 01:26:03.660
Well, you're too late!

01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:05.286
Skeletrons, get him!

01:26:16.256 --> 01:26:17.799
Argh! I can't move!

01:26:18.925 --> 01:26:20.093
You see, your friends...

01:26:20.343 --> 01:26:21.343
oh, they're finished!

01:26:22.512 --> 01:26:23.721
My world is almost finished.

01:26:25.348 --> 01:26:27.934
The last thing I need to do is finish...

01:26:28.184 --> 01:26:29.644
- ...you.
- No, stop! Please!

01:26:29.894 --> 01:26:32.522
If you do one more thing,
I'm gonna unleash my secret weapon.

01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:34.399
Your secret weapon?

01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:37.527
Yes, it's called:

01:26:37.777 --> 01:26:39.779
The Power of The Special.

01:26:40.029 --> 01:26:41.281
That sounds dumb.

01:26:42.073 --> 01:26:45.451
All right, here it comes.
My secret weapon...

01:26:46.411 --> 01:26:47.745
is this.

01:26:49.038 --> 01:26:51.624
What is that? Is it super small?
I don't see anything.

01:26:51.875 --> 01:26:54.043
It's my hand. I want you to take it.

01:26:54.294 --> 01:26:55.670
You want me to take your hand off?

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:58.590
No, I want you to join me.

01:26:59.048 --> 01:27:02.135
Look at all of these
things that people built.

01:27:02.427 --> 01:27:03.720
You might see a mess...

01:27:03.970 --> 01:27:06.598
Exactly. And a bunch
of weird, dorky stuff...

01:27:06.848 --> 01:27:09.100
that ruined my perfectly good stuff!

01:27:10.059 --> 01:27:11.936
Okay. What I see...

01:27:12.437 --> 01:27:15.607
are people inspired by each other...

01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:17.567
and by you.

01:27:18.693 --> 01:27:21.237
People taking what you made...

01:27:21.779 --> 01:27:24.032
and making something new out of it.

01:27:40.506 --> 01:27:42.216
Finn, did you make all of this?

01:27:45.011 --> 01:27:47.597
The people are trying to stop
President Business...

01:27:47.847 --> 01:27:49.724
from using the Kragle.

01:27:50.558 --> 01:27:51.893
What's the Kragle?

01:27:52.602 --> 01:27:55.355
Um, it's in there.

01:27:57.523 --> 01:27:59.025
In here?

01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:40.775
So President Business is the bad guy?

01:28:48.741 --> 01:28:49.993
If...

01:28:51.452 --> 01:28:53.955
If the construction guy...

01:28:55.123 --> 01:28:56.763
said something
to President Business...

01:29:00.712 --> 01:29:02.463
what would he say?

01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:10.430
You...

01:29:11.723 --> 01:29:14.100
don't have to be...

01:29:15.018 --> 01:29:16.352
the bad guy.

01:29:18.896 --> 01:29:19.896
You...

01:29:20.356 --> 01:29:22.108
are the most talented...

01:29:23.151 --> 01:29:24.485
most interesting...

01:29:25.903 --> 01:29:29.198
and most extraordinary person
in the universe.

01:29:30.825 --> 01:29:33.995
And you are capable of amazing things...

01:29:34.746 --> 01:29:38.499
because you are The Special.

01:29:41.878 --> 01:29:43.212
And so am I.

01:29:46.174 --> 01:29:47.884
And so is everyone.

01:29:49.343 --> 01:29:51.387
The prophecy is made-up...

01:29:52.221 --> 01:29:54.057
but it's also true.

01:29:54.724 --> 01:29:55.975
It's about all of us.

01:29:56.684 --> 01:29:59.062
Right now, it's about you.

01:30:00.396 --> 01:30:01.731
And you...

01:30:02.857 --> 01:30:04.317
still...

01:30:05.068 --> 01:30:07.236
can change everything.

01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:34.347
Oh, we got a hugger.

01:30:36.891 --> 01:30:37.975
Be careful.

01:30:38.226 --> 01:30:41.604
I have been told it might explode.

01:30:52.615 --> 01:30:53.699
Phew.

01:30:54.742 --> 01:30:57.078
Emmet, thank you.

01:30:57.328 --> 01:30:59.789
And I just want you to know,
from the bottom of my heart...

01:31:00.248 --> 01:31:01.791
from this moment forward...

01:31:02.041 --> 01:31:04.377
I solemnly promise that I will never...

01:31:13.970 --> 01:31:15.429
Emmet!

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.974
Hey, everyone! ls everyone okay?

01:31:18.766 --> 01:31:19.767
Where's Lucy?

01:31:20.309 --> 01:31:21.309
Emmet!

01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:22.728
Lucy!

01:31:25.898 --> 01:31:27.191
We did it.

01:31:33.239 --> 01:31:35.491
Oh. Uh, Emmet, wait.

01:31:36.075 --> 01:31:38.744
Batman, there's something
I need to say to you.

01:31:38.995 --> 01:31:40.580
No. Wyldstyle...

01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:42.039
I mean...

01:31:42.748 --> 01:31:44.125
."Lucy.

01:31:45.251 --> 01:31:47.378
He's the hero you deserve.

01:31:50.506 --> 01:31:52.550
- Uh...
- Thanks, Batman.

01:32:04.103 --> 01:32:06.772
I liked Emmet before it was cool.

01:32:07.607 --> 01:32:09.650
Whoops, I have the antidote for the Kragle.

01:32:09.901 --> 01:32:11.360
How did that happen?

01:32:11.611 --> 01:32:13.029
Yay!

01:32:13.279 --> 01:32:14.447
- De-Kragler.
- Watch this.

01:32:14.697 --> 01:32:15.823
- Yay!
- Oh, Mommy, Daddy.

01:32:16.073 --> 01:32:17.073
You're okay!

01:32:17.241 --> 01:32:18.826
- Oh, son!
- Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

01:32:20.328 --> 01:32:22.079
We're okay, son. Ha, ha.

01:32:22.330 --> 01:32:24.971
Guys, time to come up for dinner.
It's Taco Tuesday, your favorite.

01:32:25.208 --> 01:32:28.336
- Okay, honey. We'll be up in a sec.
- Yeah, we'll be up in a sec!

01:32:28.836 --> 01:32:30.504
- I gotta tell you something.
- What?

01:32:30.755 --> 01:32:32.755
Now that I'm letting you
come down here and play...

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:34.720
guess who else gets to
come down here and play'?

01:32:34.759 --> 01:32:36.135
- Who?
- Your sister.

01:32:36.385 --> 01:32:37.385
What?

01:32:37.386 --> 01:32:39.466
Well, things sure have a way
of working out smoothly.

01:32:39.597 --> 01:32:40.306
Am I right, GUYS?

01:32:40.556 --> 01:32:42.308
What?

01:32:47.605 --> 01:32:50.024
We're from the Planet Duplon.

01:32:50.274 --> 01:32:53.486
We are here to destroy you.

01:32:55.071 --> 01:32:56.614
Oh, man.

01:37:57.248 --> 01:37:59.542
Yes, this is real music.

01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:02.336
Dark, brooding...

01:38:02.795 --> 01:38:04.421
important...

01:38:04.672 --> 01:38:06.006
groundbreaking.

01:38:07.633 --> 01:38:08.676
Check out the lyrics.

01:38:11.345 --> 01:38:12.763
Darkness

01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:16.433
No parents

01:38:19.144 --> 01:38:20.938
Continued darkness

01:38:21.188 --> 01:38:22.940
More darkness. Get it?

01:38:23.190 --> 01:38:25.067
The opposite of light

01:38:25.776 --> 01:38:27.194
Black hole

01:38:27.987 --> 01:38:29.196
Curtains drawn

01:38:30.781 --> 01:38:32.366
In the basement

01:38:33.492 --> 01:38:35.077
Middle of the night

01:38:36.453 --> 01:38:38.455
<i>Blacked-out windows</i>

01:38:40.124 --> 01:38:41.542
Other places that are dark

01:38:43.794 --> 01:38:45.004
Black suit

01:38:46.213 --> 01:38:47.715
Black coffee

01:38:48.465 --> 01:38:50.634
You get it. That's just the first verse.

01:38:50.884 --> 01:38:52.720
Darkness

01:38:54.013 --> 01:38:55.889
No parents

01:38:57.141 --> 01:38:58.392
Super rich

01:38:59.935 --> 01:39:01.604
Kind of makes it better
