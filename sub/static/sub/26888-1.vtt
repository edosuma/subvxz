02:56.932 --> 02:59.834
I'm particularly excited
to taste this harvest,

02:59.836 --> 03:01.668
because I've followed
these grapes

03:01.670 --> 03:03.937
from a tiny,
little grape seedling.

03:03.939 --> 03:07.411
Oh! Who's that handsome stranger
hiding over there?

03:07.843 --> 03:09.109
Hi, Billie.

03:09.111 --> 03:10.980
Sorry. Hi Liza viewers!

03:11.447 --> 03:12.546
Did I ruin it?

03:12.548 --> 03:14.080
No, no, it's okay.
I can do it later.

03:14.082 --> 03:15.149
- Okay.
- No problem.

Fuck, that's good!

03:33.468 --> 03:35.104
Yeah, but you say that
about all the wines.

03:35.504 --> 03:37.471
- I'll take it, though.
- You should.

03:37.473 --> 03:39.072
Did you see
our new save the date?

03:39.074 --> 03:40.343
Ah, no.

03:40.943 --> 03:42.746
Ooh.

03:43.445 --> 03:44.448

- How good does it look?
- Very good.

03:48.016 --> 03:49.449
- So good.
- Mm-hm.

03:51.454 --> 03:53.019
I have work to do

03:53.021 --> 03:55.022
for that stupid
strawberry presentation

03:55.024 --> 03:56.690
- No.
- I know, it sucks.

03:58.527 --> 04:00.096
Can't you just make up
some shit?

04:00.729 --> 04:02.596
Tell them about how the seeds
are on the outside, or...

04:02.598 --> 04:04.697
And Janey put me
on cold calls today.

04:04.699 --> 04:06.900
Then all the more reason
for you to relax.

04:06.902 --> 04:08.903
You're like a tiny,
adorable devil.

04:08.905 --> 04:10.137
Yes, and you love it.

04:11.706 --> 04:14.710
No, no. I have to focus
on strawberries.

04:14.911 --> 04:16.810
Maybe when I have
my own situation,

04:16.812 --> 04:17.913
I can make my own rules.

04:18.447 --> 04:20.149
Or you could break
your own rules.

04:20.649 --> 04:22.983
Until then,
it's all strawberries for me.

04:22.985 --> 04:24.084
- No.
- Come on.

04:24.086 --> 04:26.019
Give it back!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon...

- Can I not eat it now?
- Later.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.663
- What?
- It's my birthday.

05:07.896 --> 05:09.096
No, it's not.

05:10.867 --> 05:12.966
Okay, happy birthday, Cynthia.

05:12.968 --> 05:15.870
- Cyn. My name's Cyn.
- I'm not calling you that.

05:15.872 --> 05:17.805
Why not?
Everyone else is doing it.

05:17.807 --> 05:19.443
Who? Who else is doing it?

- You always call me Cyn, right?
- Okay.

05:26.516 --> 05:28.582
- See?
- See what?

05:28.584 --> 05:29.949
She doesn't know
why she's saying okay.

05:29.951 --> 05:32.051
- She's on autopilot.
- Probably just looking

05:32.053 --> 05:33.856
at that stupid candy company
of hers.

05:34.156 --> 05:35.522
Leave her alone.

05:35.524 --> 05:37.524
She's busy dying
like everybody else.

05:37.526 --> 05:39.827
You always call me Cyn, Joanne.

05:39.829 --> 05:41.695

06:13.829 --> 06:16.296

- Joanne, I'll need more candy.

06:16.298 --> 06:17.566
Okay.

06:21.903 --> 06:23.202
- Janey...
- Billie, hi.

06:23.204 --> 06:25.072
Ah, just the person
I wanted to see.

06:25.074 --> 06:26.240
Come on in.

06:26.242 --> 06:27.240
Sit down.

06:30.178 --> 06:31.780
Oh, damn...

06:32.014 --> 06:33.747
I noticed
that you've been working

06:33.749 --> 06:34.981
- lots of late nights.
- Yeah.

06:34.983 --> 06:36.349
And we can't have that anymore.

06:38.153 --> 06:40.589
No one's really working
over 35 hours a week.

06:40.889 --> 06:42.526
- What? 35?
- Starting now.

06:42.925 --> 06:43.927
Later, Larry.

06:45.961 --> 06:47.060
So, technically,

06:47.062 --> 06:49.363
that means that everyone
is part-time.

06:49.365 --> 06:51.098
- But what about...
- Which technically means

06:51.100 --> 06:53.099
that you don't have
any more health insurance.

06:55.670 --> 06:57.837
Oh, I hope you've been
to the dentist.

06:57.839 --> 06:59.808
And listen,
we've had to let Sandra go.

07:00.276 --> 07:03.276
So I'm going to need you
to handle the Hunterman account.

07:03.278 --> 07:04.613
Okay? Okay.

07:06.348 --> 07:08.214
Yeah? Yeah. Here.

07:08.216 --> 07:09.716
Have a candy.

07:09.718 --> 07:11.288
Oh! There we go!

07:12.788 --> 07:14.788
Look at my big, blue ball.

07:14.790 --> 07:16.225
Isn't it cute?

07:38.747 --> 07:39.682
Oh, wow.

07:40.682 --> 07:43.349
Oh, fuck, you ate so much of it!

07:43.351 --> 07:44.418
Give it to me!

07:44.420 --> 07:46.019
Everything's being taken away.

07:46.021 --> 07:47.387
I said eat it later.

07:47.389 --> 07:49.055
Janey's taking away
our health insurance

07:49.057 --> 07:50.358
and our hours. It's like,

07:50.360 --> 07:52.925
"Why am I working this shit job
if there aren't any benefits?

07:52.927 --> 07:54.363
- What's the point?"
- Oh, boy.

07:54.930 --> 07:56.130
I mean, I'm stupid.

07:56.132 --> 07:57.798
I don't think
I can do this anymore.

07:57.800 --> 07:58.865
You'll be fine.

07:58.867 --> 08:00.370
It's a presentation
on strawberries.

08:00.802 --> 08:02.072
I said don't eat any more!

08:02.937 --> 08:04.038
It's an edible.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.072
- This is pot cake?
- Yeah!

08:06.074 --> 08:07.274
Why would you bring that?

08:07.276 --> 08:09.375
Janey's taking away
our health insurance?

08:09.377 --> 08:12.046
Yes, but now
I've got to give presentation

08:12.048 --> 08:13.113
- fucking high!
- I'm sorry.

08:13.115 --> 08:15.683
- Why would you do that to me?
- It's my birthday.

08:15.685 --> 08:17.418
It's not your birthday!

08:17.420 --> 08:19.118
It's your half birthday.

08:19.120 --> 08:21.021
How much more clear could I be?

08:21.023 --> 08:22.158
Cynthia!

08:22.425 --> 08:24.627
I said eat it later.

08:24.826 --> 08:27.226
Later, as in, not now.

08:27.228 --> 08:28.695
When you say "special,"

08:28.697 --> 08:30.230
- that doesn't mean pot!
- It doesn't matter,

08:30.232 --> 08:31.498
because you have to do it!

08:31.500 --> 08:33.131
- I won't fucking do it!
- You're fucking ready!

08:33.134 --> 08:34.368
You got all the shit

08:34.370 --> 08:35.469
- It doesn't fucking...
- A fucking binder!

08:35.471 --> 08:36.770
Great.

08:36.772 --> 08:38.136
- No.
- Take a deep breath.

08:38.139 --> 08:39.373
- You take a deep breath!
- A deep breath.

Uh... Hillsbury Farms.

08:48.817 --> 08:50.052
Strawberries...

08:50.418 --> 08:51.919
are a fruit.

08:51.921 --> 08:53.054
I love them.

08:53.056 --> 08:55.425
They're the only fruit
with the seeds on the outside.

08:56.357 --> 08:57.991
And, uh... You love them.

08:57.993 --> 08:59.763
Uh, everybody
loves strawberries.

09:08.236 --> 09:10.673
Strawberries.

09:12.107 --> 09:14.743
Strawberries.

09:16.577 --> 09:20.316
Imagine that one strawberry
equals one day of your life.

09:21.884 --> 09:25.922
We have 28,835 strawberries
to live.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.387
Some people more,
some people less.

09:28.389 --> 09:30.092
This is just an average.

09:31.927 --> 09:36.966
We sleep for 8,477 strawberries.

09:37.432 --> 09:38.766
And we eat and we drink

09:38.768 --> 09:41.838
and we prepare food for 1,635.

09:42.370 --> 09:45.339
We work for 3,202.

09:45.341 --> 09:47.040
And we commute to work

09:47.042 --> 09:48.978
for 1,635.

09:50.078 --> 09:52.813
So we have time for social media

09:52.815 --> 09:54.547
- and church, and...
- I think she's high.

09:54.549 --> 09:56.049
...community service.

09:56.051 --> 09:59.855
That means that we have
2,740 strawberries left.

10:00.355 --> 10:01.287
That's it.

10:07.296 --> 10:08.230
<i>Fuck.</i>

10:11.200 --> 10:12.469

I quit!

10:20.375 --> 10:23.145
I'm not gonna give you
one more of my strawberries.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.750
Fucking do this.

10:28.283 --> 10:30.086
My God, she's really high.

11:01.850 --> 11:04.017

- I'm so sorry.

11:04.019 --> 11:05.986

Babe, we're really late.

11:13.863 --> 11:15.465

- We're really late.

11:16.865 --> 11:18.431
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

11:18.433 --> 11:21.069
It's crazy.
Patty has been driving me crazy.

11:21.503 --> 11:23.136
The wedding party

11:23.138 --> 11:25.571
would line up here and here

11:25.573 --> 11:28.076
- during the ceremony.
- Great! That's what I thought.

11:28.543 --> 11:29.879
- Billie!
- Huh?

11:30.613 --> 11:33.113
Um, I was thinking
the flowers...

11:33.115 --> 11:36.019
- But maybe we don't need...
- ...would go in each pew.

11:37.019 --> 11:38.488
...all the flowers.

11:39.587 --> 11:42.522
I mean, this place
is pretty much good as-is.

11:42.524 --> 11:43.556
I mean, right?

11:43.558 --> 11:47.230
I mean, look at the colors
in the lines, and...

11:48.096 --> 11:49.228
the architecture.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.498
God did a great job
with this place,

11:51.500 --> 11:53.467
- am I right?
- We need flowers.

11:53.469 --> 11:55.201
- He knows what I mean.
- It'll look terrible.

11:55.203 --> 11:56.670
- No offense, but...
- Yeah.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.604
- Not terrible, but...
- Totally.

11:58.606 --> 12:00.475
We'll have flowers.
Patty, I trust you.

12:02.177 --> 12:03.312
Billie?

12:05.480 --> 12:06.982
What is going on?

12:07.448 --> 12:09.583
- Nothing.
- You're acting really weird.

12:09.585 --> 12:11.550
- Are you okay?
- I'm great.

12:11.552 --> 12:12.551
I'm so great.

12:12.553 --> 12:14.954
I'm thinking maybe we don't need
all the flowers.

12:14.956 --> 12:16.924
Or any.
Maybe we don't need any flowers.

12:16.926 --> 12:19.128
You know,
minimalist is very in right now.

12:19.327 --> 12:21.695
Yeah.
Ooh, that could be our theme.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.633
You know:
"If it doesn't bring you joy,

12:24.133 --> 12:25.201
get rid of it."

12:26.168 --> 12:27.633
Flowers don't bring you joy?

12:27.635 --> 12:30.036
We're having...
we're having flowers.

12:30.038 --> 12:32.204
Absolutely.
Let's keep the flowers.

12:32.206 --> 12:34.074
But hey,
what about not having cake?

12:34.076 --> 12:35.675
- What?
- People could bring their own.

12:35.677 --> 12:37.279
It would be like BYOC.

12:38.212 --> 12:39.147
No.

12:40.048 --> 12:41.417
What is going on...?

12:42.518 --> 12:43.550
Oh!

12:43.552 --> 12:44.954
Shit!

12:46.322 --> 12:48.157
Your presentation. I'm sorry.

12:48.657 --> 12:50.960
Ah... How did it go?
Were people confused?

12:51.360 --> 12:54.427
Did you remember to tell them
about the seeds on the outside?

12:54.429 --> 12:55.899
I quit my job.

12:56.532 --> 12:57.631
What? You what?

12:57.633 --> 12:59.569
It was
a giant, sinking turd, Gayle.

13:00.402 --> 13:02.038
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

13:02.337 --> 13:03.372
Um...

13:04.307 --> 13:05.439
I've been doing
the work of three people,

13:05.441 --> 13:07.541
and they're going to take away
our health insurance.

13:07.543 --> 13:08.742
I did mention the seeds,

13:08.744 --> 13:11.078
but nobody cared,
except for fucking Larry.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.382
Again, I'm so sorry.

13:12.748 --> 13:13.747
But look at me.

13:13.749 --> 13:15.248
- Okay.
- I'm so sorry.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.483
I'll fix it, I promise.

13:16.485 --> 13:18.986
I'm gonna find my thing.
I'm gonna find my...

13:18.988 --> 13:20.323
Life is a Cabernet.

13:20.556 --> 13:23.059
It's going to be amazing.
I'll work on my own terms.

13:26.695 --> 13:28.362
Wait,
what were we talking about?

13:28.364 --> 13:29.465
Are you high?

13:30.331 --> 13:31.301
No...

13:49.350 --> 13:50.419
Hey you.

13:51.386 --> 13:52.421
Hey you.

13:55.024 --> 13:56.091
Gayle, don't worry.

13:58.559 --> 14:00.062
I made a spreadsheet.

14:00.395 --> 14:02.094
Mm, I love it
when you talk dirty.

14:02.096 --> 14:04.698
It's for our wedding bills
and our expenses.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.369
Mm-hm. Keep going.

14:09.138 --> 14:11.107
I'm gonna have to deal
with my mom tomorrow.

14:11.572 --> 14:13.108
It's gonna be okay.

14:14.610 --> 14:16.209
Don't worry, Gayle.

14:16.211 --> 14:17.580
I know what I'm doing.

14:20.783 --> 14:22.018
Okay.

14:22.418 --> 14:23.385
Okay.

14:28.423 --> 14:29.992
So, what are you gonna do?

14:48.277 --> 14:49.412
<i>This sucks.</i>

14:50.546 --> 14:52.248
<i>Running around like a squirrel
for some peanuts.</i>

14:52.480 --> 14:54.381
<i>Elephants dance for peanuts.</i>

14:54.383 --> 14:56.285
<i>I wish I was dancing.
Or stripping.</i>

14:56.684 --> 14:58.020
<i>That pays well, right?</i>

14:58.287 --> 15:00.152
<i>Okay, maybe not,
like, pole dancing,</i>

15:00.154 --> 15:01.521
<i>but something fun.</i>

15:01.523 --> 15:02.792
<i>Something meaningful.</i>

15:03.692 --> 15:05.661
<i>Like this 14-year-old kid.</i>

15:05.860 --> 15:07.227
<i>Fuck this kid!</i>

15:07.229 --> 15:08.361
<i>This kid was lucky.</i>

15:08.363 --> 15:09.563
<i>I have ideas.</i>

15:09.565 --> 15:11.098
<i>I can be resourceful.</i>

15:11.100 --> 15:12.299
<i>I can do anything,</i>

15:12.301 --> 15:14.203
<i>dance to my own tune,
be my own boss.</i>

15:15.269 --> 15:17.539
<i>I can be a lion.
Yeah, I can be a giver.</i>

15:19.173 --> 15:20.442
<i>Uh, sorry, man.</i>

15:23.312 --> 15:25.380
<i>Yeah, that's...
That's all I got.</i>

15:33.754 --> 15:36.623
...all around me,
but I only see my surroundings.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.157
I only feel my own heartbeat.

15:38.159 --> 15:39.493
Uh, hello.

15:39.495 --> 15:40.730
- Hi.
- Oh! Oh, my!

15:41.163 --> 15:43.497
Oh, a new person! Hello!

15:43.499 --> 15:44.598
No, no, no.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.537
You are the unstable one
from yesterday, aren't you?

15:48.370 --> 15:49.438
Yeah.

15:49.904 --> 15:51.740
- Yeah, that is her.
- Welcome.

15:52.173 --> 15:53.839
Hi, dear.
What is your name?

15:53.841 --> 15:54.874
- Billie.
- Billie.

15:54.876 --> 15:56.078
Billie.

15:56.677 --> 15:58.210
Sounds like a fake name.

15:58.212 --> 16:00.216
It's... My real name is Billie.

16:00.581 --> 16:03.349
Billie,
why don't we get you a nametag?

16:03.351 --> 16:05.187
- Okay.
- Come on over here. Oh!

16:05.620 --> 16:08.320
I brought some new markers,

16:08.322 --> 16:09.789
but just be careful,

16:09.791 --> 16:12.224
because I think
they're the kind you...

16:12.226 --> 16:13.826
You know?

16:13.828 --> 16:14.862
Ooh, let's see, now.

16:14.864 --> 16:17.397
Oh, I don't...
Now where could they have gone?

16:17.399 --> 16:18.898
Why don't you get
some coffee cake

16:18.900 --> 16:20.166
- while I'm looking?
- Oh.

16:20.168 --> 16:21.401
Sam made it.

16:21.403 --> 16:22.502
Oh, hi.

16:22.504 --> 16:23.402
- I'm Sam.
- Hi.

16:23.404 --> 16:25.272
- I made the coffee cake.
- Okay.

16:25.274 --> 16:27.373
If you're vegan, don't eat it.
I didn't make it vegan.

16:27.375 --> 16:28.610
Oh, I'm not vegan.

16:28.876 --> 16:30.212
You can eat it, then.

16:30.511 --> 16:31.877
- Cool mug, right?
- Yeah.

16:31.879 --> 16:33.546
Fucking love the aquarium.

16:33.548 --> 16:34.516
Yeah.

16:35.384 --> 16:36.483
Here they are!

16:39.721 --> 16:41.490
Ah, there you go, darling.

16:42.624 --> 16:43.625
Billie...

16:45.293 --> 16:46.528
'cause that's...

16:48.496 --> 16:50.430
- ...my real name.
- Oh, no, no, dear.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.668
On our left shoulder.
Like that.

16:54.669 --> 16:56.538
- Okay, I think it's on.
- Okay.

17:00.975 --> 17:02.342
Oh!

17:02.344 --> 17:03.810
My flyer.

17:03.812 --> 17:05.411
Did you get it?

17:05.413 --> 17:07.646
Freelancers, not a mouse.

17:07.647 --> 17:09.248
Oh, yeah.

17:09.250 --> 17:11.287
I see the rat
that you put on it.

17:13.588 --> 17:14.690
Larry?

17:15.891 --> 17:17.627
You know, if you're gonna join,
then you need to sign in.

17:18.259 --> 17:19.362
Uh, okay.

17:20.929 --> 17:21.830
Yeah.

17:24.967 --> 17:26.301
Like, your real name.

17:27.269 --> 17:29.372
All right, I'm going to go
with Billie...

17:29.938 --> 17:32.305
- Kingston.
- Still sounds fake.

17:32.307 --> 17:33.573
Sounds like a real name.

17:33.575 --> 17:35.278
Maybe a nickname.

17:35.711 --> 17:36.742
I thought this was a place

17:36.744 --> 17:38.577
to find
employment opportunities.

17:38.579 --> 17:39.446
It is.

17:39.448 --> 17:41.584
Why do you all
have to sign in and out?

17:41.849 --> 17:42.817
What's it to you?

17:43.451 --> 17:44.854
It's for the church.

17:45.287 --> 17:47.886
Yeah, she's in AA,
so we get the space for free.

17:47.888 --> 17:48.856
Wow.

17:49.490 --> 17:51.658
Thanks for sharing my secrets
with everybody.

17:51.660 --> 17:53.526
- Appreciate it.
- What?

17:53.528 --> 17:55.394
So, what is this, exactly?

17:55.396 --> 17:58.600
I'm starting to think that maybe
my flyer wasn't clear enough.

17:58.834 --> 18:00.836
Yeah, I think it was probably
the mouse.

18:03.404 --> 18:04.440
Yeah.

18:05.574 --> 18:07.343
This is our safe space.

18:07.576 --> 18:10.043
We network with each other
to find jobs.

18:10.045 --> 18:13.779
You know what they say:
"Resourcefulness is a resource."

18:13.781 --> 18:16.218
Great. So... where are they?

18:17.352 --> 18:18.384
What, dear?

18:18.386 --> 18:19.621
The resources.

18:20.756 --> 18:21.757
Do you not have any?

18:22.723 --> 18:25.392
It's better to come here
and search for a job

18:25.394 --> 18:27.360
than go
to some frou-frou coffee shop

18:27.362 --> 18:29.498
with a bunch
of elitist assholes, Billie.

18:30.432 --> 18:32.332
We used to have
more freelancers.

18:32.334 --> 18:33.702
Then they started freelancing.

18:34.001 --> 18:35.035
What?

18:35.037 --> 18:36.872
Yeah, I gotta say, I...

18:37.439 --> 18:38.837
I don't like your tone.

18:38.839 --> 18:41.341
Yeah, you starting to sound
kinda toney.

18:41.343 --> 18:43.776
- No I don't, I...
- You're doing it there again.

18:43.778 --> 18:44.913
Just... right there.

18:45.579 --> 18:47.546
Mm, yeah,
I kinda hear it now, too.

18:47.548 --> 18:49.815
- Yeah, I heard it, too.
- Okay, hang on!

18:49.817 --> 18:51.817
Why don't we just get
another slice

18:51.819 --> 18:53.819
of Sam's coffee cake, shall we?

18:53.821 --> 18:54.853
I'm so sorry.

18:54.855 --> 18:56.623
I can't eat it,
I'm trying vegan.

18:56.625 --> 18:57.993
Don't eat it, it's not vegan.

18:58.693 --> 19:02.461
Why don't we all
just share in a circle

19:02.463 --> 19:03.765
why we're all here.

19:04.031 --> 19:05.033
No.

19:05.767 --> 19:06.936
That will be depressing.

19:14.108 --> 19:16.742
This is gorgeous.

19:16.744 --> 19:18.745
- Yeah?
- Absolutely!

19:18.747 --> 19:20.113
- It's not bad.
- Honey...

19:20.115 --> 19:22.748
It's just not what we planned
for a Sonoma wedding.

19:22.750 --> 19:24.918
Then it's a good thing
we'll get married here.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.120
Well, there's still time
for a venue change.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.888
What!
I thought we were getting...

19:28.890 --> 19:30.390
Oh, my life is here, Mom.

19:30.392 --> 19:33.296
Well, whose choice was that?

19:33.894 --> 19:36.062
I mean, wow.
This A-line silhouette

19:36.064 --> 19:38.030
is absolutely stunning.

19:38.032 --> 19:39.567
- You look beautiful.
- Yeah...

19:39.835 --> 19:41.671
It's super pretty, but...

19:42.371 --> 19:44.403
I don't know.
It's, like, 5,000 dollars.

19:44.405 --> 19:45.974
Oh, I can ask
about a payment plan.

19:46.540 --> 19:49.709
If you consider Sonoma,
I'd be happy to help.

19:49.711 --> 19:51.811
You know,
I'm Orbitz platinum status now,

19:51.813 --> 19:53.546
all the times
coming to visit you.

19:53.548 --> 19:55.984
I could probably get
some hotel rooms...

19:56.417 --> 19:58.852
they might even throw in
a suite for me.

19:58.854 --> 20:00.519
Hell, they might throw in
a puppy.

20:00.521 --> 20:01.990
Well, it's my life, Mom.

20:02.624 --> 20:04.593
But does it look like this?

20:04.992 --> 20:06.526
It looks like my life.

20:06.528 --> 20:08.331
Look, I'm only suggesting.

20:08.663 --> 20:10.396
I don't need your suggestions.

20:10.398 --> 20:11.700
Okay, okay, okay.

20:36.924 --> 20:40.093
What are you playing?

20:40.095 --> 20:41.630
Oh, it's a game I designed.

20:41.829 --> 20:44.063
Shooting aliens
always make me feel better.

20:44.065 --> 20:45.634
You fixed the code already?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.699
This is
an all pointer exception.

20:47.701 --> 20:48.567
You know how to code?

20:48.569 --> 20:51.506
Yeah, I do weekend availability.

20:52.673 --> 20:54.774
Sam, can you work
character changes

20:54.776 --> 20:56.442
- in the final bid?
- I won't go over

20:56.444 --> 20:57.379
six times.

20:58.646 --> 21:00.979
Too much customer concentration,
it wouldn't be worth my while.

21:04.819 --> 21:06.518
Well, you tell them that.

21:06.520 --> 21:07.953
I'm about to re-gram
this page

21:07.955 --> 21:09.021
- right here.
- Re-what?

21:09.023 --> 21:10.090
- Wait.
- Re-gram.

21:10.092 --> 21:12.661
- When you repost...
- Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

21:13.961 --> 21:16.132
Oh, my God, you're my...
my thing.

21:16.498 --> 21:18.030
The things. All this here.

21:18.032 --> 21:19.132
You, you, you.

21:19.134 --> 21:20.068
You.

21:20.469 --> 21:21.601
What are you doing?

21:21.603 --> 21:22.701
Don't you see it?

21:22.703 --> 21:24.871
- No.
- This place, you people.

21:24.873 --> 21:26.072
This is what happens
when you bring

21:26.074 --> 21:27.039
those smelly markers.

21:27.041 --> 21:28.074
This office
has more talent in it

21:28.076 --> 21:29.107
than the one I left.

21:29.109 --> 21:30.545
I feel like that's sad.

21:30.811 --> 21:32.180
No, it is, it's very sad.

21:32.547 --> 21:34.581
Don't you see?
You all have something to offer.

21:34.583 --> 21:36.716
Don't waste time waiting
for some place to hire you.

21:36.718 --> 21:38.884
We can create a small business
right here.

21:38.886 --> 21:41.120
- At Freelancers Anonymous?
- Yes!

21:41.122 --> 21:42.255
Does that even make sense?

21:42.257 --> 21:44.923
It's better than dicking around
with smelly markers.

21:44.925 --> 21:47.125
Oh no, I have a degree
in graphic design...

21:47.127 --> 21:49.128
- ...from Yale University.
- Nobody cares.

21:49.130 --> 21:50.563
You have a degree, too?

21:50.565 --> 21:52.498
I thought you just enjoyed
being on Twitter.

21:52.500 --> 21:55.000
A B.S.
in social media and marketing.

21:55.002 --> 21:56.102
Definitely a degree.

21:56.104 --> 21:57.871
- Instagram is a job?
- You wanna fight?

21:59.074 --> 22:00.773
Somebody hold my milk.
Not you. Hold this.

22:00.775 --> 22:01.874
Come here! Come at me!

22:01.876 --> 22:03.276
- Okay.
- Bring it here!

22:03.278 --> 22:05.711
You have to come at me.
That's how I engage.

22:05.713 --> 22:07.680
You see, can you see... Oh, wow.

22:07.682 --> 22:09.248
See what's happening, William?
See what you did?

22:09.250 --> 22:10.552
How is this my fault?

22:11.554 --> 22:12.585
'Cause you come here
and stir everything up,

22:12.587 --> 22:15.521
and you ask all these questions
about resources.

22:15.523 --> 22:16.825
I was curious.

22:17.057 --> 22:18.190
Why don't you take

22:18.192 --> 22:20.192
your 1,000 questions
and your fake name

22:20.194 --> 22:21.230
and you just leave.

22:21.663 --> 22:22.929
Billie is my real name.

22:22.931 --> 22:24.596
I don't care
if your name is William

22:24.598 --> 22:25.664
or Charles or Chuckie.

22:25.666 --> 22:26.665
I think you should go.

22:26.667 --> 22:28.901
- That's what I think. Get out.
- Cake, anyone?

22:28.903 --> 22:29.969
She doesn't get cake!

22:29.971 --> 22:31.840
- I can eat it if I want to.
- No.

22:32.606 --> 22:33.907
No, it's for members only.

22:33.909 --> 22:35.678
Oh, I signed in. So...

22:36.144 --> 22:37.813
- There you go.
- Oh.

22:38.212 --> 22:39.214
Okay.

22:40.115 --> 22:41.847
Let's just see here...

22:41.849 --> 22:43.615
Oh! Fake name.

22:45.086 --> 22:46.818
I think we should have cake now.

22:46.820 --> 22:49.087
- I thought we hated Sam's cake.
- Wait, what?

22:49.089 --> 22:50.757
I mean, love it.

22:50.759 --> 22:53.159
I'm vegan, but I love it.

22:53.161 --> 22:54.760
I can't... I want more.

22:54.762 --> 22:56.094
You can't tell me what to do.

22:56.096 --> 22:57.663
You may scare everybody else,

22:57.665 --> 22:59.734
but you don't scare me.

23:00.801 --> 23:01.903
Fuck you, Billie.

23:03.005 --> 23:05.241
Oh, things are really getting
out of hand.

23:09.243 --> 23:10.776
Hey!

23:10.778 --> 23:12.745
My face!

23:12.747 --> 23:15.180
- My face!
- Oh, I'm so sorry!

23:15.182 --> 23:17.283
It's in my mouth!

23:19.688 --> 23:21.019
You happy now, William?

23:21.021 --> 23:22.854
No! Don't you people get it?

23:22.856 --> 23:24.056
I'm completely not happy,

23:24.058 --> 23:25.158
that's why I came
in the first place.

23:25.160 --> 23:27.596
You're all a bunch of losers.

23:27.929 --> 23:30.330
Did she just...?
Shit, I lost my nametag.

23:51.685 --> 23:52.788
- Hey.
- Ah!

23:53.188 --> 23:54.754
Oh, hello.

23:56.924 --> 23:58.991
Anne Westgate's back.

23:58.993 --> 24:00.258
Westgate's back?

24:00.260 --> 24:02.894
- Oh, yes.
- I thought you hated being her.

24:02.896 --> 24:04.966
She makes you feel
cheap and dirty inside.

24:06.134 --> 24:08.267
Yeah, I know.
Anne's the worst.

24:08.269 --> 24:09.969
But we need the money, so...

24:09.971 --> 24:11.403
What's it called?

24:11.405 --> 24:15.408
It is called
<i>Submission: A Howling Tail.</i>

24:15.410 --> 24:17.376
"Tail?" Like, T-A-I-L?

24:17.378 --> 24:19.845
- Mm-hm. Book one.
- Book one?

24:19.847 --> 24:21.213
- There are six.
- Six tails?

24:21.215 --> 24:23.718
It turns out werewolf
erotica is really popular.

24:24.352 --> 24:26.956
- Let's hear some Ms. Westgate.
- Mm. Okay.

24:29.089 --> 24:31.326
- Don't mind if I do.
- Okay.

24:32.292 --> 24:34.262
I need to find a sexy voice.

24:34.796 --> 24:37.130
"'Don't you know who you are?'

24:38.098 --> 24:41.034
Randall whispered into her ear,

24:41.036 --> 24:43.872
- luring her under his spell."
- Oh.

24:44.405 --> 24:48.708
"'Oh, yes, deeper!'

24:48.710 --> 24:50.209
She moaned."

24:50.211 --> 24:52.411
Just... flip, flip, flip.

24:52.413 --> 24:53.682
Okay.

24:56.317 --> 24:58.051
"His shaft lengthened

24:58.053 --> 25:00.420
and slipped through
her moist center."

25:00.422 --> 25:01.254
Ugh!

25:01.256 --> 25:04.990
"Until the screams
turned from 'Oh!'

25:04.992 --> 25:09.027
to 'Corn!', stopping Randall
in his tracks."

25:09.029 --> 25:11.165
Wait, wait, wait.
The safe word is "corn"?

25:13.034 --> 25:15.137
Oh, my God,
should we change our safe word?

25:17.705 --> 25:18.740
Ah!

25:20.174 --> 25:21.175
Corn.

25:22.042 --> 25:24.178
I fucking love you.

25:28.316 --> 25:29.382
How was work?

25:29.384 --> 25:30.449
It sucked.

25:46.934 --> 25:48.302
I brought donuts.

25:49.002 --> 25:50.071
Oh!

25:51.105 --> 25:52.438
Fuck.

25:52.440 --> 25:53.972
Didn't you say we were losers?

25:53.974 --> 25:54.940
Yep, she did.

25:54.942 --> 25:56.345
Yeah, but I didn't mean that.

25:57.377 --> 25:58.844
That doesn't make me
feel better.

25:58.846 --> 26:00.246
'Cause it's not an apology.

26:00.248 --> 26:02.217
- I'm sorry.
- I don't believe you.

26:03.284 --> 26:04.953
- Neither does Larry.
- Nametag.

26:07.087 --> 26:10.158
Remember that you almost killed
Charlotte by way of coffee cake?

26:12.292 --> 26:14.259
Oh, I am so sorry.

26:14.261 --> 26:16.898
That was an accident,
I was trying to defend myself.

26:17.198 --> 26:19.034
You hit me in my face.

26:19.267 --> 26:21.400
- Your face was in the way.
- Of what?

26:21.402 --> 26:23.771
Safe space! Starting now.

26:24.138 --> 26:25.440
I brought the donuts.

26:25.973 --> 26:27.041
We can't be bought.

26:27.442 --> 26:28.844
I can be bought.

26:30.878 --> 26:32.980
I am so glad you're back.

26:35.884 --> 26:37.917
Who's a loser now,
huh, Chuckie B.?

26:37.919 --> 26:39.251
Probably still us.

26:39.253 --> 26:40.553
No, don't say that.

26:40.555 --> 26:41.953
You guys aren't losers.

26:41.955 --> 26:44.859
Sam, you coded
an entire videogame.

26:46.124 --> 26:47.459
I just used
an open-sourced game engine

26:47.461 --> 26:50.228
and applied linear algebra
to some preexisting 3D models

26:50.230 --> 26:51.467
to turn them into pixels.

26:51.932 --> 26:53.799
And the wrapper
over the HLSL shader

26:53.801 --> 26:55.069
to render things onscreen.

26:55.403 --> 26:56.371
It's very simple.

26:56.837 --> 26:58.106
Charlotte helped, too.

26:59.173 --> 27:01.343
I... I designed the aliens.

27:02.376 --> 27:05.944
See? You made aliens!
You brought aliens to life.

27:05.946 --> 27:07.814
Surely we can bring ourselves
to life!

27:07.816 --> 27:09.015
Yeah...

27:09.017 --> 27:10.917
We don't do that here,
it's not our thing.

27:10.919 --> 27:13.018
Yes you do, you just do it
on your own terms.

27:13.020 --> 27:14.487
- That's true.
- Let's do it.

27:14.489 --> 27:16.021
Let's work on our own terms.

27:16.023 --> 27:17.291
Let's do something fulfilling.

27:18.492 --> 27:19.894
I want to be fulfilled.

27:20.461 --> 27:21.497
But, like...

27:22.431 --> 27:24.330
- what will we do?
- Should we make a list?

27:24.332 --> 27:25.768
List! Yes!

27:26.000 --> 27:27.566
Ugh.

27:27.568 --> 27:30.038
Yeah, a list
is gonna get us in <i>Forbes.</i>

27:30.438 --> 27:31.807
Oh, ah...

27:32.173 --> 27:33.174
Gayle.

27:34.474 --> 27:35.778
Gayle.

27:36.376 --> 27:37.378
Honey, are you ready?

27:38.980 --> 27:40.546
I know it's not on the list,

27:40.548 --> 27:44.150
but the concierge said there's
an amazing florist uptown.

27:44.152 --> 27:46.017
- Randall leaned in...
- On Broadway.

27:46.019 --> 27:48.190
Sounds fancy.

27:48.957 --> 27:50.392
"Oh!" Simone howled.

27:55.230 --> 27:57.196
Gayle Anne Preston!
What are you doing?

27:57.198 --> 27:58.133
Mom!

27:58.398 --> 27:59.534
What the fuck?

28:00.034 --> 28:01.334
- Language!
- Oh, fuck.

28:01.336 --> 28:03.337
I'll have to record
this part all over again.

28:03.938 --> 28:05.103
You're recording that?

28:05.105 --> 28:06.407
Yeah, it's kinda my job.

28:07.040 --> 28:09.609
But, what about
that Liza Minelli thing

28:09.611 --> 28:12.080
- with the wine?
- "Life is a Cabernet"?

28:13.213 --> 28:14.316
It's my other job.

28:14.915 --> 28:17.315
Well, this job
sounds like pornography.

28:17.317 --> 28:18.987
I know, I'm the one saying it.

28:20.454 --> 28:22.388
I don't even know
what you do here.

28:22.390 --> 28:24.092
Well, now you know.

28:26.426 --> 28:27.626
Ta-dah!

28:32.432 --> 28:33.602
You need jobs.

28:35.169 --> 28:36.434
That's the company.

28:36.436 --> 28:38.536
Oh, inadequacies
are the company?

28:38.538 --> 28:40.375
Wait, so we are losers?

28:41.075 --> 28:42.076
Safe space.

28:42.676 --> 28:45.277
Freelancers Anonymous

28:45.279 --> 28:47.013
- is the company.
- I don't get it.

28:47.015 --> 28:48.116
Oh.

28:48.615 --> 28:50.251
Okay, I see what you did there.

28:51.184 --> 28:52.921
The diagram was kinda confusing.

28:53.121 --> 28:55.121
Oh, my God. This is ridiculous.

28:55.123 --> 28:56.622
There is no company.

28:56.624 --> 28:58.524
There is, right here.

28:58.526 --> 29:01.126
A way to connect businesses
with the freelancers

29:01.128 --> 29:02.094
- who need them.
- How?

29:02.096 --> 29:04.196
It's like a freelancing app
for freelancers.

29:04.198 --> 29:06.364
Great. There's already
a thousand of them.

29:06.366 --> 29:08.467
- We'll be a competitor.
- Hm. Okay.

29:08.469 --> 29:10.239
Do you know
how to create an app?

29:11.038 --> 29:12.273
Not necessarily...

29:12.707 --> 29:14.209
I probably could.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.409
It depends
on what kind of features

29:16.411 --> 29:17.642
you want to add.

29:17.644 --> 29:19.378
And development time increases

29:19.380 --> 29:21.550
if you want
both iOS-Android technology.

29:22.016 --> 29:23.352
And we would have to have...

29:23.617 --> 29:26.254
registration, profile creation,
payment integration.

29:26.621 --> 29:28.720
Depending on how many
interactive elements you want,

29:28.722 --> 29:31.026
like SMS integration,
push notifications...

29:31.392 --> 29:33.562
we're looking at a few months
for development.

29:35.529 --> 29:37.697
Okay, an app. Duh.
My followers would love that.

29:37.699 --> 29:39.565
- Yes!
- And it could be searchable

29:39.567 --> 29:41.636
by job or location or something.

29:42.002 --> 29:43.135
- Amazing!
- Or something!

29:43.137 --> 29:45.470
We could vet both the parties
that register with it.

29:45.472 --> 29:47.472
We would be
a safe space for everyone.

29:47.474 --> 29:49.174
- Right?
- Exactly. Let's do it.

29:49.176 --> 29:50.543
Let's get investors
and launch an app.

29:50.545 --> 29:52.047
Investors?

29:53.047 --> 29:55.284
Oh. Yeah, we don't know
how to do that.

29:55.549 --> 29:57.251
Yeah, that's Gillian's thing.

29:58.019 --> 29:58.921
Gillian?

30:00.555 --> 30:01.456
Oh.

30:01.722 --> 30:03.258
I'm on lunch.

30:09.329 --> 30:12.300
The owner of this place
is James from hot yoga.

30:12.767 --> 30:16.038
He promised me a killer deal
during downward dog.

30:16.503 --> 30:17.471
Ooh!

30:18.271 --> 30:19.572
What about this one?

30:19.574 --> 30:22.576
It's got a wonderful,
bouncy attitude about it.

30:23.277 --> 30:24.375
I don't know.

30:24.377 --> 30:27.182
Does that fit into
a verbal pornographer's budget?

30:27.448 --> 30:28.550
Oh, my God.

30:29.017 --> 30:30.516
That's an interesting question.

30:30.518 --> 30:32.086
I don't actually know.

30:32.487 --> 30:34.723
Ooh. Hydrangeas!

30:37.057 --> 30:39.560
So is Billie also taking on
a second job?

30:40.694 --> 30:41.596
Gayle?

30:42.730 --> 30:44.199
Um, she quit her job.

30:45.098 --> 30:46.033
What?

30:46.500 --> 30:48.034
Quit her job.

30:48.036 --> 30:49.638
What?

30:50.505 --> 30:52.240
- Bees!
- It's fine.

30:52.707 --> 30:54.042
It's fine.

30:54.241 --> 30:56.741
So you are whoring
yourself out...

30:56.743 --> 30:59.644
Oh, my God, Mom,
I'm not whoring myself out!

30:59.646 --> 31:00.648
Okay?

31:01.449 --> 31:03.451
Jesus Christ.

31:03.750 --> 31:06.721
Can't you just be supportive
for once in your fucking life?

31:07.622 --> 31:09.458
This is exactly
what you did to Dad.

31:10.124 --> 31:11.724
I have everything under control.

31:11.726 --> 31:14.093
Watch out!

31:18.432 --> 31:20.102
Gayle.

31:20.401 --> 31:22.137
You'll never fucking guess...

31:22.369 --> 31:24.836
Oh, God, angry tap dancing.
What happened?

31:24.838 --> 31:26.838
- Mom.
- Oh, no.

31:26.840 --> 31:29.208
She found out
about Anne Westgate.

31:29.210 --> 31:31.076
She won't shut the fuck up
about Sonoma,

31:31.078 --> 31:32.777
and then she dragged my ass
to uptown,

31:32.779 --> 31:34.712
which is a bullshit forest.

31:34.714 --> 31:36.481
Did you at least find
pretty flowers?

31:36.483 --> 31:37.651
Oh. Yeah.

31:38.152 --> 31:39.418
We found flowers.

31:39.420 --> 31:42.289
We found 900 dollars' worth
of flowers.

31:46.426 --> 31:48.126
I'll break
that broomstick in half

31:48.128 --> 31:49.630
and shove it
up your ass, Norman!

31:50.163 --> 31:51.497
Okay.

31:51.499 --> 31:53.164
Well hey, guess what?

31:53.166 --> 31:55.567
I'm starting my own company.

31:55.569 --> 31:56.671
You're what?

31:57.704 --> 31:58.536
I'm starting my own company.

31:58.538 --> 32:00.206
This morning
you didn't have a job,

32:00.208 --> 32:01.539
and now you have a company?

32:01.541 --> 32:04.178
Um, yeah.
Freelancers Anonymous.

32:04.811 --> 32:06.313
Freelancers Anonymous?

32:06.646 --> 32:07.712
You're starting a company

32:07.714 --> 32:09.317
with the unemployed
church people?

32:10.317 --> 32:12.551
They're not unemployed,
they're just freelancers.

32:12.553 --> 32:13.822
...who aren't freelancing!

32:14.721 --> 32:16.324
I'm fucking freelancing!

32:18.859 --> 32:20.892
I can't have
this conversation right now.

32:20.894 --> 32:22.463
I have a pot roast in the oven.

32:22.797 --> 32:24.330
Stop eating chips.

32:30.137 --> 32:31.839
This pot roast is a little dry.

32:33.807 --> 32:35.343
No, it's good.

32:37.644 --> 32:39.080
No, it needs carrots.

32:41.883 --> 32:43.218
Maybe some...

32:44.251 --> 32:45.353
corn?

32:46.887 --> 32:48.289
No? Okay.

33:16.483 --> 33:18.551

33:18.553 --> 33:19.884
Shit! Jesus.

33:19.886 --> 33:21.623
Sorry. My... bad.

33:22.890 --> 33:23.889
Come on, girl.

33:23.891 --> 33:25.391
It's app day.

33:25.393 --> 33:27.229
Okay, calm down.

33:29.529 --> 33:32.901
You do know that 90 percent
of apps fail, right?

33:33.733 --> 33:35.537
So? That's what we got Sam for.

33:35.736 --> 33:37.539
Has Sam ever even created
an app?

33:37.837 --> 33:39.406
- Sure she has.
- Huh?

33:39.640 --> 33:41.276
Have you ever created an app?

33:41.576 --> 33:43.278
- No.
- Wait...

33:44.311 --> 33:45.212
You haven't?

33:45.645 --> 33:46.548
No.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.682
But it shouldn't be that hard.

33:50.351 --> 33:51.286
Great.

33:52.420 --> 33:54.756
So you've actually never created
an app?

33:55.256 --> 33:56.625
Like, actually, actually?

33:57.557 --> 33:59.161
No, I haven't...

33:59.559 --> 34:01.829
...actually, actually.

34:03.330 --> 34:04.398
Actually.

34:04.932 --> 34:06.300
Actually, actually.

34:07.835 --> 34:08.902
She hasn't ever...

34:09.335 --> 34:11.239
- It's a double negative.
- Yeah, I get it.

34:11.472 --> 34:13.306
I got it, I got you.

34:13.641 --> 34:14.842
Exciting!

34:15.943 --> 34:18.309
I have brought my sketchpad
for designing app ideas.

34:18.311 --> 34:20.945
Okay, so you've designed apps
before, then?

34:20.947 --> 34:22.815
No.

34:22.817 --> 34:23.818
Sam has.

34:24.751 --> 34:26.721
Huh. Actually, Sam hasn't.

34:27.822 --> 34:29.724
- Not yet.
- Really?

34:30.023 --> 34:32.724
What about you? You have
the B.S. degree in social media.

34:32.726 --> 34:34.295
I, uh...

34:34.762 --> 34:35.730
I mean...

34:36.030 --> 34:37.795
I can distribute an app.

34:37.797 --> 34:39.864
I'll distribute
the fuck out of an app.

34:39.867 --> 34:41.835
But I have to have
an app... first,

34:42.570 --> 34:43.938
before I can distribute it.

34:44.438 --> 34:45.606
- Does June know?
- No.

34:46.273 --> 34:47.039
Know what, dear?

34:47.041 --> 34:48.474
June doesn't know.

34:48.476 --> 34:49.577
I could know.

34:49.876 --> 34:51.409
- How to make an app?
- No, dear.

34:51.411 --> 34:52.746
I don't know that.

34:53.813 --> 34:55.679
Wow. Okay, so...

34:55.681 --> 34:57.383
So you guys want to start
a company

34:57.385 --> 34:58.720
with someone you don't know.

34:59.619 --> 35:01.019
Oh, Billie? We know her.

35:01.021 --> 35:03.557
- She brought donuts.
- One time.

35:04.025 --> 35:05.760
She brought donuts one time.

35:05.992 --> 35:07.628
They were crappy donuts,
let's be real.

35:09.697 --> 35:11.896
Going into business
with someone you don't know

35:11.898 --> 35:14.465
is like getting married
to someone you don't know.

35:14.467 --> 35:16.302
It's commitment, it's trust,

35:16.304 --> 35:18.840
it's focus,
it's having each other's back.

35:19.507 --> 35:20.875
We don't know this person.

35:23.577 --> 35:25.747
Hey, guys. Ready to get started?

35:26.547 --> 35:28.546
- You didn't bring any donuts?
- Huh?

35:28.548 --> 35:29.847
That was a one-day thing.

35:31.552 --> 35:33.021
Does everyone know
where to start?

35:42.496 --> 35:43.898
...makes me feel better.

35:44.965 --> 35:46.465
Wait, so you own a company?

35:46.467 --> 35:47.865
Yeah, well, sort of.

35:47.867 --> 35:49.635
Currently I may have
zero employees.

35:49.637 --> 35:50.936
So you don't own a company.

35:50.938 --> 35:52.740
No, I do, it's just that...

35:53.340 --> 35:54.773
I may not be very good at it...

35:54.775 --> 35:55.907
- Let me in?
- ...yet.

35:55.909 --> 35:58.010
I need you to get it together.
Please.

35:58.012 --> 36:00.412
Do you know that Janey
has us at 30 hours a week?

36:00.414 --> 36:01.612
That's not sustainable.

36:01.614 --> 36:02.817
I need your company.

36:03.384 --> 36:04.849
Save me from this hellhole!

36:06.653 --> 36:07.853
I think somebody has me
in an experiment

36:07.855 --> 36:09.623
designed
to make people go insane!

36:09.923 --> 36:11.559
Wait, what does your company do?

36:11.958 --> 36:13.425
- We're...
- It doesn't matter.

36:13.427 --> 36:14.760
Do they have health insurance?

36:14.762 --> 36:16.564
- Yes.
- Okay!

36:16.864 --> 36:18.930
I'm on board. Let's do it.

36:18.932 --> 36:20.898
You go build your empire.

36:20.900 --> 36:22.101
- Get those employers.
- But...

36:22.103 --> 36:23.871
Be their Oprah. Say it with me.

36:24.371 --> 36:25.637
- Yes.
- Yes.

36:25.639 --> 36:26.972
- Yes.
- Yes.

36:26.974 --> 36:28.507
- Yes.
- Go. Go!

36:28.509 --> 36:29.575
- Go!
- No, I mean, go.

36:29.577 --> 36:30.508
- Go!
- Go now.

36:30.510 --> 36:31.579
Oh, go now...

36:33.681 --> 36:35.717
Okay, guys,
I'm here to be your Oprah.

36:38.619 --> 36:39.988
Troops are on lunch, Oprah.

36:41.722 --> 36:43.057
What is your problem?

36:43.858 --> 36:45.557
- Excuse me?
- Ever since I got here,

36:45.559 --> 36:46.958
you've been a huge asshole.

36:46.960 --> 36:48.659
You've been here,
like, two days.

36:48.661 --> 36:49.596
So?

36:50.431 --> 36:53.001
So?
Tried to kill me with your bike.

36:53.634 --> 36:54.967
That's what this is about?

36:54.969 --> 36:56.702
You tried to kill me
with your bike,

36:56.704 --> 36:57.802
and now you want me to go
to business with you.

36:57.804 --> 37:00.472
I didn't try to...
How can I kill you with a bike?

37:00.474 --> 37:02.077
I don't know.
You came at me hard.

37:04.512 --> 37:06.577
You know,
you don't even know these women.

37:06.579 --> 37:07.646
You think you do, but you don't,

37:07.648 --> 37:09.851
and if you don't know them,
you can't help them.

37:10.717 --> 37:12.753
Where were you leading them
before I got here?

37:15.054 --> 37:16.724
Gillian, I need you.

37:17.157 --> 37:18.025
Please.

37:18.893 --> 37:20.362
You know these women.

37:20.927 --> 37:23.364
Do you want to try?
Create something?

37:23.963 --> 37:25.632
Do you want to see
what they can do?

37:26.434 --> 37:27.569
Please.

37:32.139 --> 37:33.871
You're really going to take
a phone call?

37:33.873 --> 37:34.975
Yeah, hang on one sec.

37:36.143 --> 37:37.512
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

37:37.878 --> 37:39.478
I'm at work.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.746
<i>What? You were supposed to be
here 45 minutes ago.</i>

37:41.748 --> 37:43.384
<i>Look at what
you've left me with!</i>

37:44.585 --> 37:46.784
Oh, wow. Okay. Um...

37:46.786 --> 37:49.021
- I'm on my way, stay there.
- <i>I'm at the caterer's.</i>

37:49.023 --> 37:51.793
- Where are you?
- <i>The catering company.</i>

37:51.992 --> 37:53.595
Okay, you're good. Copy that.

37:53.927 --> 37:55.827
I gotta go. It's my fiancée.

37:55.829 --> 37:58.032
Congratulations.

37:59.099 --> 38:00.132
Yay.

38:03.237 --> 38:04.606
Hey. Hey.

38:05.039 --> 38:06.704
Hey, hey, I'm sorry.

38:06.706 --> 38:07.741
I'm sorry.

38:07.942 --> 38:09.074
I was late.

38:09.076 --> 38:11.108
Can Glenn reschedule?
He loves Patty.

38:11.110 --> 38:12.244
I'm his favorite.

38:12.246 --> 38:13.979
Do you need me to talk to him?

38:13.981 --> 38:15.046
Why don't you let me speak?

38:15.048 --> 38:17.751
No. No one needs to talk to you
right now, Mom.

38:18.117 --> 38:19.784
Can't we just come back later?

38:19.786 --> 38:21.720
No. Later I have to read about

38:21.722 --> 38:24.626
how Randall's quivering member
makes Simone fucking submit.

38:25.226 --> 38:27.762
Oh, yeah. I'm at the climax.

38:28.161 --> 38:29.797
Hey, I said I'm sorry.

38:30.764 --> 38:33.264
- I have feelings too, you know.
- Oh, like I don't?

38:33.266 --> 38:34.967
No, obviously you have
all of them.

38:34.969 --> 38:38.237
I have to read
a 400 page book right now

38:38.239 --> 38:40.873
that I am actually
losing money on

38:40.875 --> 38:43.809
because I want to stop and vomit
every time I have to act

38:43.811 --> 38:46.878
like I'm being fucked
by a throbbing shaft.

38:46.880 --> 38:47.945
- Jesus, Gayle.
- I'm trying to keep up

38:47.947 --> 38:48.914
with "Life is a Cabernet,"

38:48.916 --> 38:50.782
and I'm trying to plan
our fucking wedding

38:50.784 --> 38:52.117
all by myself, Billie!

38:52.119 --> 38:53.751
Jesus, Gayle, just calm...

38:53.753 --> 38:54.787
All by myself!

38:54.789 --> 38:57.759
I told you I would help
with our stupid wedding.

38:58.259 --> 38:59.891
I needed you today.

38:59.893 --> 39:02.159
I was at work.
I came right over.

39:02.161 --> 39:03.929
No, you were
with the church people.

39:03.931 --> 39:05.764
The church people have names.

39:05.766 --> 39:07.798
It's a fake fucking company,
Billie.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.735
- They're...
- They don't pay you there!

39:09.737 --> 39:12.070
It's real,
I'm just not paying myself yet.

39:12.072 --> 39:13.137
Are...?

39:13.139 --> 39:14.840
That means it's not real!

39:14.842 --> 39:16.110
We are making an app.

39:16.844 --> 39:19.847
It's like when I say words,
you don't hear them.

39:21.114 --> 39:24.048
Just find
a real fucking job, Billie!

39:27.221 --> 39:29.090
Mom, Patty, come on!

39:31.759 --> 39:33.025
Bye, Billie.

39:45.672 --> 39:47.040
Let's make a fucking app.

39:54.213 --> 39:55.916
You heard her.
Let's make an app.

39:58.786 --> 39:59.885
Now?

39:59.887 --> 40:01.219
Yeah, I've got plans.

40:01.221 --> 40:02.923
Also, we need to make
a demo first.

40:03.289 --> 40:05.257
Okay, fine.
Then let's make a demo.

40:05.259 --> 40:08.762

40:14.001 --> 40:15.900
And in getting them
to the launch party.

40:15.902 --> 40:17.235
Most important thing: financing.

40:17.237 --> 40:18.003
It all makes sense,

40:18.005 --> 40:19.905
but if financing
equals investors,

40:19.907 --> 40:22.206
how does that equate
to social media and sharing?

40:22.208 --> 40:24.008
Once we have the launch party...

40:24.010 --> 40:25.213

41:37.684 --> 41:39.383
We'll have good people there.

41:39.385 --> 41:41.686
I'm good with investors,
trust me on this.

41:41.688 --> 41:42.787
You think I'm an asshole
and I'm not,

41:42.789 --> 41:43.988
I'm actually
a really great person.

41:43.990 --> 41:45.691
- I think you are great.
- Thank you.

41:45.693 --> 41:47.191
- See you later. Wonderful.
- It's just...

41:48.461 --> 41:49.963
Here. Wait a minute.

41:50.764 --> 41:51.963
Just... wait.

41:54.001 --> 41:55.367
Holy fuck! It's a bag of money!

41:55.369 --> 41:57.769
You don't need to scream,
we get it.

41:57.771 --> 42:00.041
- Why is this in your car?
- 'Cause I...

42:00.273 --> 42:01.440
Stop asking questions.

42:01.442 --> 42:02.744
None of your business.

42:03.876 --> 42:05.744
Why are you giving me
a bag of money?

42:05.746 --> 42:07.382
Okay, I'm not giving it to you.

42:08.148 --> 42:09.416
I'm giving it to everyone.

42:09.916 --> 42:11.749
I want us to have
a good launch party.

42:11.751 --> 42:13.387
Just use it wisely.

42:15.489 --> 42:16.724
Thank you.

42:17.190 --> 42:18.925
I'll take care of it.

42:25.132 --> 42:26.398
So, put it in the bank?

42:26.400 --> 42:27.898
Is that a statement
or a question?

42:27.900 --> 42:29.202
Don't worry, I got it.

42:30.070 --> 42:31.405
Oh, God.

42:49.856 --> 42:51.458
Where were you last night?

42:55.362 --> 42:56.898
What time is it?

42:57.364 --> 42:59.701
I don't think
I can do this anymore.

43:00.800 --> 43:03.070
You know, maybe we should
just postpone the wedding.

43:03.936 --> 43:04.806
No.

43:05.271 --> 43:06.907
No, don't say that.

43:08.775 --> 43:10.242
Well, why not, Billie?

43:10.244 --> 43:12.814
I mean,
our bills are fucking piling up,

43:13.079 --> 43:14.782
You never fucking come home.

43:15.548 --> 43:17.085
You don't even have a job.

43:17.351 --> 43:18.419
I have a job.

43:19.152 --> 43:20.385
I have a... I got a job.

43:20.387 --> 43:21.989
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

43:26.059 --> 43:27.858
Yeah! I mean, the...

43:27.860 --> 43:29.496
They paid me last night, and...

43:30.030 --> 43:31.199
Look.

43:41.440 --> 43:43.108
Really? They paid you already?

43:43.110 --> 43:44.175
Yeah.

43:44.177 --> 43:46.146
It's under the table, but...

43:46.579 --> 43:48.882
we're going to have enough
for the wedding.

43:51.952 --> 43:53.020
I can take care of it.

43:58.358 --> 43:59.494
Come here.

44:02.295 --> 44:03.163
Come here.

44:05.097 --> 44:06.166
I've got you.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.099
All right.

44:15.141 --> 44:16.508
<i>The biggest risk
you can take</i>

44:16.510 --> 44:17.845
<i>is by doing nothing.</i>

44:21.315 --> 44:22.517
<i>I'll pay it all back.</i>

44:24.050 --> 44:25.119
<i>Fuck.</i>

44:26.619 --> 44:28.855
<i>I shouldn't spend
any more of that money.</i>

44:30.590 --> 44:31.793
<i>Shit.</i>

44:34.228 --> 44:36.030
<i>Okay, it's investment.</i>

44:37.364 --> 44:38.465
<i>Seed money.</i>

44:40.032 --> 44:41.201
<i>Yeah, I read about that.</i>

44:42.603 --> 44:44.305
<i>Development funds.</i>

44:45.405 --> 44:47.508
<i>Stop worrying
about what you have to lose...</i>

44:48.342 --> 44:50.478
<i>and start focusing
on what you have to gain.</i>

44:54.414 --> 44:55.883
<i>What do I have to lose?</i>

45:13.400 --> 45:15.532
I'm still updating the CSS code
for the app

45:15.534 --> 45:17.434
so we can navigate it
for the launch.

45:17.436 --> 45:19.172
We're still in beta,
not live yet.

45:19.438 --> 45:22.007
- Pretty straightforward.
- Sam, this is awesome!

45:22.009 --> 45:24.943
So, we just make that bigger,
and that not look like that.

45:24.945 --> 45:26.480
Hey, let's take a break.

45:31.952 --> 45:32.954
Hey.

45:34.221 --> 45:35.119
Hey.

45:35.121 --> 45:37.224
- So, uh, slight hitch.
- Shoot.

45:37.590 --> 45:38.925
I need the money back.

45:39.293 --> 45:41.528
- Huh?
- I need the money back.

45:42.128 --> 45:43.964
Uh... how much of it?

45:44.398 --> 45:45.963
- All of it.
- All of it?

45:45.965 --> 45:46.697
Yeah.

45:46.699 --> 45:47.766
It seems like people

45:47.768 --> 45:49.266
don't want to invest in an app
until they see it.

45:49.268 --> 45:50.568
Like a physical demo,

45:50.570 --> 45:52.637
which makes sense
when you think about it.

45:52.639 --> 45:55.276
- So...
- Well, ah... um...

45:55.675 --> 45:56.541
What...

45:56.543 --> 45:58.543
Are you having a stroke?
Are you okay?

45:58.545 --> 45:59.644
No, no, not a stroke.

45:59.646 --> 46:01.916
Why do we need all of it?

46:02.315 --> 46:05.115
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
We need all of it.

46:05.117 --> 46:06.019
That's all.

46:06.519 --> 46:07.889
Don't get mad...

46:09.056 --> 46:09.956
I'm not mad.

46:10.891 --> 46:12.425
Okay, so here's the thing,
is that, um...

46:13.260 --> 46:15.429
I possibly don't have all of it.

46:17.063 --> 46:18.932
You don't have it?

46:19.398 --> 46:20.298
Uh, possibly.

46:20.300 --> 46:22.370
- How possibly?
- Very possibly.

46:22.668 --> 46:24.271
- Where is it?
- Um...

46:24.704 --> 46:26.007
Okay, so...

46:27.606 --> 46:30.277
- Tell me where the money is.
- So I gave it to Gayle.

46:31.010 --> 46:32.376
So you gave it to Gayle?

46:32.378 --> 46:33.512
We've been struggling,

46:33.514 --> 46:36.117
and she told me I wasn't allowed
to come here anymore.

46:36.349 --> 46:38.316
So I kinda made up a fake job,

46:38.318 --> 46:40.684
and I've maybe used the money
as my fake paycheck.

46:40.686 --> 46:42.519
But it's fine,
I can figure this out,

46:42.521 --> 46:43.657
there's no need to panic.

46:46.159 --> 46:48.425
You lied to me. Nuh-uh.

46:48.427 --> 46:50.295
You're going to get
your money back.

46:50.297 --> 46:52.229
We'll make it up
with the investors,

46:52.231 --> 46:53.430
it only takes one yes.

46:53.432 --> 46:56.570
Look, I know how it works,
but we don't have any investors.

46:57.403 --> 46:59.072
We don't have any investors?

46:59.405 --> 47:01.405
What about the demo?
Shh. Hold on.

47:01.407 --> 47:03.340
<i>What's happening, Marti?</i>

47:03.342 --> 47:04.611
I told you guys.

47:05.177 --> 47:06.677
I told you
this wasn't a good idea,

47:06.679 --> 47:08.545
and you got excited
to make your own company,

47:08.547 --> 47:10.048
and now look what we have.

47:10.050 --> 47:11.516
So there will be
no launch party?

47:11.518 --> 47:15.019
No, there is no launch party
because you spent all the money.

47:15.021 --> 47:17.088
- She spent all the money.
- You spent it?

47:17.090 --> 47:18.757
- <i>She spent the money?</i>
- Okay...

47:18.759 --> 47:20.492
Wait, how much money?

47:20.494 --> 47:21.726
Why would you do that?

47:21.728 --> 47:23.597
I can explain. I have a plan.

47:24.097 --> 47:25.299
I trusted you.

47:25.798 --> 47:27.432
- We all trusted you.
- <i>Billie.</i>

47:27.434 --> 47:28.436
And you ripped us off.

47:29.202 --> 47:30.668
- So...
- <i>Billie...</i>

47:30.670 --> 47:32.373
I think you should just go.

47:33.239 --> 47:34.375
We don't need you.

47:35.576 --> 47:37.445
- We never needed you.
- <i>I'm so disappointed.</i>

47:59.432 --> 48:00.632
Billie?

48:00.634 --> 48:02.135
You home?

48:08.641 --> 48:09.643
Billie?

48:12.278 --> 48:13.380
Billie?

48:18.117 --> 48:19.219
Hey.

48:22.422 --> 48:23.657
Hey, what happened?

48:24.123 --> 48:25.525
I have to tell you something.

48:27.661 --> 48:28.561
Okay.

48:34.367 --> 48:35.269
It's okay.

48:37.237 --> 48:39.173
I'm sure whatever it is,
it'll be okay.

48:55.856 --> 48:57.792
<i>You are not cut out for this.</i>

48:58.492 --> 48:59.593
<i>Just get it back.</i>

48:59.860 --> 49:01.394
<i>Smile, and nod.</i>

49:02.195 --> 49:03.330
<i>And kill me.</i>

49:03.896 --> 49:07.264
<i>You can pay it all back
in 2,536 days</i>

49:07.266 --> 49:09.135
<i>if you cut
your Netflix subscription.</i>

49:09.902 --> 49:11.337
<i>And Amazon.</i>

49:12.639 --> 49:13.841
<i>You can fix this.</i>

49:14.875 --> 49:17.610
<i>Oh, God. It still smells
like bleach in here.</i>

49:17.878 --> 49:19.080
<i>Suck it up.</i>

49:19.346 --> 49:20.612
<i>Push through.</i>

49:20.614 --> 49:21.548
<i>You can beg.</i>

49:22.181 --> 49:23.583
<i>No shame in begging.</i>

49:25.184 --> 49:26.217
Billie!

49:26.219 --> 49:27.552
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

49:27.554 --> 49:28.853
I came to beg for my old job.

49:28.855 --> 49:31.421
What? No, you're supposed
to work on your company

49:31.423 --> 49:32.624
so I can get out.

49:32.626 --> 49:33.492
Yeah, just forget it.

49:33.494 --> 49:35.927
You know,
I can't keep lying to Gayle.

49:35.929 --> 49:38.662
Yeah, I need a job... Here.
I can help you right now.

49:38.664 --> 49:40.264
- What is this?
- It's, uh...

49:40.266 --> 49:41.633
the Hunterman packet.

49:41.635 --> 49:43.434
I have to redo it
because they gave it to a temp

49:43.436 --> 49:45.172
who doesn't know what to do.
Again.

49:45.804 --> 49:47.707
Janey really needs
a new vetting process.

49:50.342 --> 49:51.611
Wait, like an app?

49:51.844 --> 49:53.778
Do you think Janey
would invest in that?

49:53.780 --> 49:55.349
- I would.
- What?

49:55.782 --> 49:57.882
That would connect
small businesses

49:57.884 --> 49:59.583
with qualified workers.

49:59.585 --> 50:01.885
It would make quick matches
with swiping.

50:01.887 --> 50:04.391
- Like every other app.
- Okay, that sounds good.

50:04.958 --> 50:06.824
Awesome. Great. I gotta go.

50:06.826 --> 50:07.858
Thank you.

50:13.967 --> 50:15.269
Ditto.

50:15.768 --> 50:17.334
<i>Hello? Hi.</i>

50:17.336 --> 50:18.735
My name's Billie Kingston,

50:18.737 --> 50:21.241
I reserved a church
for my wedding on November 13th.

50:21.942 --> 50:23.641
Yeah, the two women. That's us.

50:23.643 --> 50:25.976
Would it be possible
to get into the reception space

50:25.978 --> 50:28.381
a little earlier in the day,
like 3 or 4 p.m.?

50:29.748 --> 50:31.518
Awesome. Thank you so much!

50:36.690 --> 50:37.956
Crashing in cars?

50:37.958 --> 50:40.425
Yeah, they're together
when they crash in the car...

50:40.427 --> 50:42.693
Have you ever been
outside of town, June?

50:42.695 --> 50:45.229
- What?
- Outside of our town.

50:45.231 --> 50:47.664
- Have you ever been outside of...
- Well, Charlie's been.

50:47.666 --> 50:49.434
Is Charlie someone in your head?

50:49.436 --> 50:50.437
Maybe.

50:51.503 --> 50:52.103
I think you need
to see somebody, June.

50:52.105 --> 50:53.706
Do you not know, or...?

50:54.306 --> 50:55.708
- Okay, no. No.
- Billie!

50:57.710 --> 51:00.446
Do you always apologize
via donuts, or...?

51:01.014 --> 51:02.479
Not just donuts.

51:02.481 --> 51:04.581
I have an idea
on how to save this company.

51:04.583 --> 51:05.719
There isn't a company.

51:06.318 --> 51:07.584
There is, and I want to add

51:07.586 --> 51:10.722
a swiping feature to the app,
just like all the other apps.

51:10.724 --> 51:11.956
It'll be great.

51:11.958 --> 51:14.827
Do you not understand that you
was the one that fucked up?

51:15.527 --> 51:17.864
Yeah, I spent some of the money.

51:18.264 --> 51:19.799
That wasn't cool,
I'll admit that.

51:20.666 --> 51:22.702
I'm so sorry, guys. I...

51:23.402 --> 51:24.969
I've been living
a personal low point

51:24.971 --> 51:25.873
right now, and...

51:27.039 --> 51:30.476
But you know what stopped me
from begging for my old job?

51:30.943 --> 51:32.677
What?

51:32.679 --> 51:34.447
You're a huge liar and a thief?

51:35.047 --> 51:36.282
No...

51:37.284 --> 51:38.419
You guys.

51:39.485 --> 51:41.288
And Market Media Outreach.

51:41.721 --> 51:44.054
They could be
the one yes that we need.

51:44.056 --> 51:46.057
They want to buy
what we're selling.

51:46.059 --> 51:47.925
I have
a marketing director friend

51:47.927 --> 51:49.329
who loves it.

51:49.862 --> 51:52.365
Did she like the reactive UI/UX?

51:52.766 --> 51:54.398
Yeah! That, too.

51:54.400 --> 51:57.003
Market Media Outreach
is the one yes that we need.

51:58.704 --> 52:00.338
Oh! And also, um...

52:00.340 --> 52:02.706
I have the money
that's left over,

52:02.708 --> 52:04.842
and we can get the rest of it
after the launch.

52:04.844 --> 52:06.010
There won't be a launch.

52:06.012 --> 52:07.878
Yes, there is, on November 13th.

52:07.880 --> 52:10.815
Thirteen is great
for businesses.

52:10.817 --> 52:14.418
It's all about being connected
and breaking new ground,

52:14.420 --> 52:15.454
and on the new moon...

52:15.456 --> 52:17.791
And it's also the day
that I'm getting married.

52:18.324 --> 52:20.691
How are you going to be
in two places at once?

52:20.693 --> 52:23.360
Well, I booked the church
from 4 to 10 p.m.,

52:23.362 --> 52:25.329
and my wedding's at 5 p.m.
in the sanctuary

52:25.331 --> 52:26.563
and should be done by 5:30,

52:26.565 --> 52:29.066
and it's followed
by the cocktail hour after,

52:29.068 --> 52:30.804
so the wedding reception
is at 6:30.

52:31.338 --> 52:33.403
So that means we can use
the reception hall

52:33.405 --> 52:35.873
for the launch party,
from 4 to 6 p.m.

52:35.875 --> 52:37.541
I already confirmed
that we can be here

52:37.543 --> 52:40.280
at 3:30 p.m. to set up.
It's easy-peasy.

52:41.380 --> 52:43.748
Oh, my God, that was
so many numbers at one time.

52:43.750 --> 52:45.983
Oh! And we'll have
extra hands on deck

52:45.985 --> 52:46.920
with the caterers.

52:48.454 --> 52:49.489
Gillian?

52:49.989 --> 52:50.958
What do you think?

53:04.838 --> 53:05.773
Fine.

53:05.972 --> 53:06.840
Okay.

53:07.907 --> 53:09.977
Don't... Don't fuck up again,
though. All right?

53:11.510 --> 53:12.579
I won't.

53:15.748 --> 53:17.914
No more donuts.
No one likes donuts.

53:17.916 --> 53:18.985
- I...
- No.

53:20.119 --> 53:22.753
And Charlotte,
you can create the invites.

53:22.755 --> 53:23.787
To the wedding?

53:23.789 --> 53:25.523
No, for the launch.

53:25.525 --> 53:26.824
Oh, sure.

53:26.826 --> 53:28.525
- Oh, Marti...
- What?

53:28.527 --> 53:30.830
You wanna post
some stuff to your followers?

53:32.030 --> 53:33.067
Hell yeah.

53:34.768 --> 53:35.766
I can do your makeup.

53:35.768 --> 53:37.337
Yeah, yeah. That'd be great.

53:37.603 --> 53:38.672
Make you look pretty.

53:41.074 --> 53:43.708
Yes, I will be a bridesmaid.

53:44.811 --> 53:46.113
Can I bake a cake?

53:46.512 --> 53:47.681
You can try.

53:50.516 --> 53:51.648
Thanks, Larry.

53:51.650 --> 53:52.618
Always there.

54:05.597 --> 54:06.900
Seven dollars in here.

54:08.168 --> 54:11.034
<i>♪ Maybe this time ♪</i>

54:11.036 --> 54:14.040
<i>♪ I'll be happy ♪</i>

54:14.574 --> 54:19.443
<i>♪ Maybe this wine will stay ♪</i>

54:19.445 --> 54:21.545
Oh! Hello there, darlings.

54:21.547 --> 54:23.079
I didn't see you there.

54:23.081 --> 54:26.150
It's me, Liza with a "z,"
and I'm here to tell you

54:26.152 --> 54:28.920
all about my new,
perky little Pinot.

54:28.922 --> 54:32.557
You see, it's got
a lovely, bitter aftertaste

54:32.559 --> 54:33.490
that reminds me...

54:33.492 --> 54:34.691
...of my mother sometimes.

54:34.693 --> 54:35.996
But that...

54:36.728 --> 54:37.630
Billie?

54:38.764 --> 54:39.799
It's just me.

54:43.570 --> 54:45.135
I don't want you to think
I'm not supportive.

54:45.137 --> 54:46.539
I am, I just...

54:47.840 --> 54:49.476
want you to be happy.

54:50.777 --> 54:51.945
I have a peace offering.

54:54.646 --> 54:56.079
I shipped a couple
of cases home,

54:56.081 --> 54:57.914
I thought it would be fun
to feature your wine

54:57.916 --> 54:59.516
at the winery this summer.

55:03.523 --> 55:04.425
Really?

55:05.224 --> 55:06.559
Of course.

55:07.594 --> 55:08.159
Who doesn't like wine

55:08.161 --> 55:09.193
fashioned after Liza?

55:09.195 --> 55:12.630
Oh, that's... Hm.
That's almost as good as mine.

55:12.632 --> 55:14.701
We'll work on it.

55:16.969 --> 55:17.971
Thanks, Mom.

55:23.576 --> 55:24.911
It's awesome.

55:26.846 --> 55:29.045
Oh, shit!
I'm totally still recording.

55:35.121 --> 55:37.655
Um, I've rerouted

55:37.657 --> 55:39.789
our contact info
so that when someone calls

55:39.791 --> 55:41.728
for the business,
it goes to our cells.

55:42.094 --> 55:43.129
- Oh, great.
- Great.

55:46.099 --> 55:48.164
It looks like
you just met online.

55:48.166 --> 55:50.700
- Looks good.
- Make sure you get the logo in.

55:50.702 --> 55:51.802
Girl, don't worry.

55:51.804 --> 55:53.104
I know how to make
an Instagram post.

55:53.106 --> 55:55.142
- She's certified.
- Verified!

56:02.949 --> 56:03.951
Um...

56:07.286 --> 56:08.286
What do I do?

56:08.288 --> 56:10.490
- Answer it, answer it!
- Yeah, answer the phone.

56:14.092 --> 56:15.027
Hello?

56:16.996 --> 56:18.097
Yes?

56:19.565 --> 56:20.567
Yes.

56:22.034 --> 56:23.002
Hold.

56:25.737 --> 56:27.137
It's a freelancer.

56:27.139 --> 56:28.574
Told you!

56:28.942 --> 56:30.141
Wow, that was very fast.

56:30.143 --> 56:31.809
- In no time at all.
- It was quick.

56:31.811 --> 56:34.278
She wants to sign up,
but we're on online yet.

56:34.280 --> 56:36.583
- What should I do?
- Make a list.

56:38.885 --> 56:40.284
Can I have your name, please?

56:42.922 --> 56:44.287
- Answer, answer!
- Okay, okay.

56:44.289 --> 56:45.925
- Calm down.
- Answer!

56:46.259 --> 56:48.027
- Be nice.
- Hello?

56:49.996 --> 56:52.532
Uh... Yes, this is
Freelancers Anonymous.

56:53.032 --> 56:55.168
Yes, I'm Gillian,
the president and CFO.

56:56.835 --> 56:59.539
Ah, hold just one moment,
please. Thank you so much.

57:01.007 --> 57:02.809
It's an investor.

57:04.309 --> 57:05.913
Okay, okay, okay.

57:06.346 --> 57:07.847
Hello. Sorry about that.

57:09.916 --> 57:11.315
Yeah, hello?

57:11.317 --> 57:13.217
Welcome to Freelancers
Anonymous. This is Billie,

57:13.219 --> 57:15.052
the CEO and the founder.

57:15.054 --> 57:16.954
- It's still ringing!
- Just a sec.

57:19.759 --> 57:20.758
Yeah.

57:20.760 --> 57:22.095
Hello, this is June.

57:24.097 --> 57:26.900
- Mm. Smell it.
- No, you don't smell.

57:27.934 --> 57:30.034
Remember, if you see something
you don't like,

57:30.036 --> 57:31.267
look away.

57:31.269 --> 57:33.340
- Okay, it's gonna be good.
- Okay. Yep.

57:34.273 --> 57:36.273
- You went out of your way...
- Oh!

57:36.275 --> 57:40.047
Okay, so I know that there is
traditionally a groom's cake,

57:41.280 --> 57:42.950
but this is...

57:43.181 --> 57:47.219
the bridegroom... groom...
bride... bride-bride cake.

57:47.920 --> 57:49.387
Oh, wow.

57:49.389 --> 57:51.325
Yeah, I mean,
I see the resemblance...

57:52.090 --> 57:53.023
- there.
- Wow.

57:53.025 --> 57:55.059
- Wow.
- The toast?

57:55.061 --> 57:56.394
- Yes, toast, please.
- Yeah.

57:56.396 --> 57:57.427
Okay.

57:57.429 --> 58:00.296
To my beautiful daughter

58:00.298 --> 58:02.001
and her gorgeous bride.

58:02.235 --> 58:04.735
May tomorrow start the beginning

58:04.737 --> 58:07.374
of your happy,
happy journey together.

58:08.206 --> 58:11.675
You are both brides, right?
I'm still...

58:11.677 --> 58:13.012
You know, I must admit, when...

58:13.413 --> 58:14.811
When Gayle first came out,

58:14.813 --> 58:16.447
I sobbed for weeks.

58:16.449 --> 58:18.885
I thought I'd never welcome in

58:19.152 --> 58:21.686
a handsome, dashing young man

58:21.688 --> 58:23.186
and have grandbabies, but...

58:23.188 --> 58:26.724
I realize...
we can still have grandbabies.

58:26.726 --> 58:28.025
Not right now,

58:28.027 --> 58:31.163
but it's all really just about
the love between you, I mean...

58:31.898 --> 58:33.097
It's just love, right?

58:33.099 --> 58:34.898
- It's...
- To love!

58:34.900 --> 58:36.166
To love. Yes.

58:37.469 --> 58:39.005
It's a nice speech.

58:39.405 --> 58:41.005
Not weird at all.

58:41.007 --> 58:43.909
To the happy, happy brides

58:44.342 --> 58:46.112
and their very special cake.

58:47.713 --> 58:49.246
- Thank you, dear.
- On that note...

58:49.248 --> 58:51.048
Oh, it's Cyn.
I don't know if we...

58:51.050 --> 58:52.115
I'm Cyn.

58:52.117 --> 58:53.150
Sin?

58:53.152 --> 58:55.720
- That doesn't sound good.
- It's C-Y-N.

58:55.722 --> 58:57.454
- It's not her name.
- Yeah.

58:57.456 --> 58:58.623
Keeping with tradition,

58:58.625 --> 59:01.825
we thought that Billie
would stay at my place tonight.

59:01.827 --> 59:04.260
Really? I didn't think
we were going that traditional.

59:04.262 --> 59:06.130
Uh, we're kinda traditional.

59:06.132 --> 59:07.231
- Yeah.
- You know, I mean,

59:07.233 --> 59:08.199
we're getting married
in the church,

59:08.201 --> 59:09.099
- and I was thinking about...
- Really?

59:09.101 --> 59:10.200
Yeah.

59:10.202 --> 59:12.436
I was thinking about staying
with Cynthia tonight.

59:12.438 --> 59:14.505
Well, I don't want
to sleep alone.

59:14.507 --> 59:17.010
Oh, but, you know,
I have a date tonight.

59:18.077 --> 59:20.681
But remember, your date's
tomorrow night, you told me?

59:21.179 --> 59:22.448
No, it's tonight.

59:22.949 --> 59:24.017
Your date's tomorrow.

59:25.784 --> 59:27.952
Oh! You know... You're so right,

59:27.954 --> 59:30.854
'cause I had the other thing
with the calendar...

59:30.856 --> 59:31.921
- It's tonight.
- Yeah.

59:31.923 --> 59:33.389
Tonight I'm free.
So you're welcome.

59:33.391 --> 59:35.126
Uh, well,
if that's what you want.

59:35.128 --> 59:36.427
- I mean...
- Your father and I

59:36.429 --> 59:38.394
spent the night
before our wedding together

59:38.396 --> 59:40.299
and look how that turned out.

59:40.900 --> 59:42.932
You know what, though?
Are you sure?

59:42.934 --> 59:45.034
Because you can definitely
stay with me

59:45.036 --> 59:46.970
anytime, actually. Anytime.

59:46.972 --> 59:48.338
Like, there's a roll-away...

59:48.340 --> 59:49.773
It's comfortable.

59:49.775 --> 59:50.807
Plenty of room.

59:50.809 --> 59:52.112
But you know what? Um...

59:52.911 --> 59:54.211
I have five turtles.

59:54.213 --> 59:57.481
One of them escaped recently.

59:57.483 --> 59:59.282
I can hear him,

59:59.284 --> 01:00:01.151
so I know he's somewhere around.

01:00:01.153 --> 01:00:03.320
And be a bit careful
when you go to the bathroom

01:00:03.322 --> 01:00:04.822
'cause that's usually
where he ends up.

01:00:04.824 --> 01:00:07.226
You're like, "Whoo!" You know?

01:00:07.492 --> 01:00:09.028
Oh, I love turtles.

01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:11.795
Yeah, one summer in high school

01:00:11.797 --> 01:00:13.733
I ran over several of them
with my car.

01:00:14.233 --> 01:00:16.202
Um, and we buried them
in the backyard.

01:00:16.402 --> 01:00:18.070
Ah, along with the...

01:00:18.503 --> 01:00:21.007
the mice, and the fish, and...

01:00:21.407 --> 01:00:22.907
several cats, and...

01:00:22.909 --> 01:00:25.108
A little cemetery
going back there,

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:27.279
and you know, that's
where they are, with my mom.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.847
Not that my mom
is in the backyard,

01:00:29.849 --> 01:00:30.880
it's my mom's house.

01:00:30.882 --> 01:00:32.016
I was in high school.

01:00:32.018 --> 01:00:33.516
- Can I cut the cake?
- Yeah, please.

01:00:33.518 --> 01:00:35.452
- Please.
- Please cut it.

01:00:35.454 --> 01:00:37.420
I think it's time.

01:00:37.422 --> 01:00:39.456
Let them eat cake.

01:00:39.458 --> 01:00:42.262
- You just cut my face...
- It's okay. Look away.

01:00:45.463 --> 01:00:46.563
Sure you don't want
to get in

01:00:46.565 --> 01:00:48.000
on that roll-away action?

01:00:48.367 --> 01:00:49.436
Ah, no, thanks.

01:00:49.869 --> 01:00:50.934
God, what a weirdo.

01:00:50.936 --> 01:00:53.172
She would flip her shit
if she knew about this.

01:00:53.505 --> 01:00:55.206
I cannot believe
you haven't told Gayle.

01:00:55.208 --> 01:00:57.842
Well, the lie won't matter
if tomorrow works.

01:00:57.844 --> 01:00:58.979
Okay, well...

01:00:59.244 --> 01:01:00.311
Glad we're at a church,

01:01:00.313 --> 01:01:02.847
so there's a priest
who can do your Last Rites.

01:01:02.849 --> 01:01:04.514
Oh, it's not a priest,
it's a pastor.

01:01:04.516 --> 01:01:05.518
I don't care.

01:01:07.052 --> 01:01:09.255
- Well, have a great date.
- I don't have a date.

01:01:10.289 --> 01:01:11.956
Why would you tell me that?

01:01:11.958 --> 01:01:17.030
Because I didn't want to have
all the smells in my house.

01:01:17.429 --> 01:01:19.229
So many smells.

01:01:19.231 --> 01:01:22.302
You know how I feel about that.
I just didn't want you there.

01:01:25.070 --> 01:01:27.271
- Billie! Billie.
- Yeah?

01:01:27.273 --> 01:01:29.472
Do you know what time it is?

01:01:29.474 --> 01:01:32.179
Jesus... Jesus Christ.

01:01:33.112 --> 01:01:34.481
Love you!

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.056
Okay, what is all this?

01:01:44.322 --> 01:01:46.456
Charlotte and Marti,
you'll be stationed here,

01:01:46.458 --> 01:01:48.594
in the long hallway
by the sanctuary side door.

01:01:49.128 --> 01:01:50.994
Wait, why am I the salt?

01:01:50.996 --> 01:01:53.199
Did you have a saltshaker
in your purse?

01:01:53.599 --> 01:01:55.298
We should just focus, okay?

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.300
Your job is to keep an eye
on the bridal party

01:01:57.302 --> 01:01:58.635
and make sure nobody wanders

01:01:58.637 --> 01:02:00.070
to the other side
of the building

01:02:00.072 --> 01:02:01.237
before we're ready.

01:02:01.239 --> 01:02:02.907
Sam, you and June will be here

01:02:02.909 --> 01:02:04.307
at the entrance
to the launch party,

01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:05.476
just outside the door

01:02:05.478 --> 01:02:07.144
at the other end of the hallway.

01:02:07.146 --> 01:02:09.112
You'll be in charge
of giving nametags

01:02:09.114 --> 01:02:10.313
to our investors.

01:02:10.315 --> 01:02:12.416
Gillian, you'll be here
inside the room

01:02:12.418 --> 01:02:13.486
running the show.

01:02:14.519 --> 01:02:16.220
- I'll be here at 15:00.
- You couldn't say three?

01:02:16.222 --> 01:02:18.222
Directly following my ceremony,

01:02:18.224 --> 01:02:20.257
in the sanctuary
there'll be wedding photos,

01:02:20.259 --> 01:02:22.392
and a cocktail hour
along the side the church

01:02:22.394 --> 01:02:23.494
here in the garden.

01:02:23.496 --> 01:02:25.929
I'll be running back and forth

01:02:25.931 --> 01:02:28.132
between the wedding photos
and the launch party

01:02:28.134 --> 01:02:30.434
using the long hallway
that connects the two spaces.

01:02:30.436 --> 01:02:31.369
Holy shit.

01:02:31.371 --> 01:02:33.637
Now, directly following
the launch party,

01:02:33.639 --> 01:02:35.572
we'll help the caterers
flip the room

01:02:35.574 --> 01:02:37.407
by gently shoving our investors

01:02:37.409 --> 01:02:39.078
out through the back door here.

01:02:39.577 --> 01:02:41.280
Oh! And we'll communicate

01:02:41.713 --> 01:02:43.115
- using these.
- Yes!

01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:45.282
Charlotte and Marti,
you share one.

01:02:45.284 --> 01:02:47.153
Sam, you and June get the other.

01:02:47.954 --> 01:02:49.987
I should probably
be in charge of that.

01:02:49.989 --> 01:02:51.891
- I was in the Girl Scouts.
- No.

01:02:52.224 --> 01:02:54.090
One, two, three, test.

01:02:54.092 --> 01:02:55.626
What if something goes wrong?

01:02:55.628 --> 01:02:58.095
Yeah, what if, miraculously,
something happens?

01:02:58.097 --> 01:03:00.500
Do we have some sort of, like,
code of distress?

01:03:01.434 --> 01:03:02.435
Corn.

01:03:03.436 --> 01:03:04.400
- What?
- We'll alert each other

01:03:04.402 --> 01:03:06.637
without arousing suspicion
by saying "corn."

01:03:06.639 --> 01:03:07.907
It's clear and concise.

01:03:08.239 --> 01:03:09.440
Okay, so you don't think

01:03:09.442 --> 01:03:11.275
that we're just going
to arouse suspicion?

01:03:11.277 --> 01:03:12.244
Anything else?

01:03:13.045 --> 01:03:14.914
Yeah. What's Larry gonna do?

01:03:15.614 --> 01:03:18.481
Oh, I'm so sorry, Larry.
I totally forgot about you.

01:03:18.483 --> 01:03:20.420
Oh!
Larry can be the salt.

01:03:21.219 --> 01:03:22.686
That's cool.

01:03:22.688 --> 01:03:25.057
Is that too tight?

01:03:30.262 --> 01:03:31.595
<i>Très</i> vintage.

01:03:31.597 --> 01:03:33.664
<i>Très</i> vintage. Okay.

01:03:33.666 --> 01:03:35.365
- Grab the poster.
- Bit of shimmer.

01:03:35.367 --> 01:03:37.300
And grab
the flowers and things.

01:03:37.302 --> 01:03:39.605
Make sure you get the fuzzies.

01:03:42.608 --> 01:03:44.945
Okay, we on our way!

01:03:45.777 --> 01:03:47.478
Stop.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.778
Where the fuck is Billie?

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:50.646
I knew
she should have stayed with me.

01:03:50.648 --> 01:03:51.749
- Wait, wait!
- Come on.

01:03:51.751 --> 01:03:53.219
Let's... Let's... Billie!

01:03:53.753 --> 01:03:55.284
- I'm here!
- Great. Go!

01:03:55.286 --> 01:03:57.588
Hey, grooms, go, go, go!

01:03:57.590 --> 01:03:59.590
- Let's go, parents.
- My cousins aren't here.

01:03:59.592 --> 01:04:02.228
Traffic, march, whatever.
Go, Grace!

01:04:02.527 --> 01:04:05.095
When I fluff this,
I want you to run!

01:04:05.097 --> 01:04:05.865
Go get married!

01:04:06.264 --> 01:04:08.201
Go!

01:04:28.253 --> 01:04:30.656
Billie's marrying a woman?

01:04:31.523 --> 01:04:32.655
She was wearing a tux.

01:04:32.657 --> 01:04:34.326
What'd you think
was gonna happen?

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.397
I don't know. I mean,
Diane Keaton wears tuxes.

01:04:43.402 --> 01:04:44.604
Nametag?

01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:46.271
Oh! It's Joseph.

01:04:47.373 --> 01:04:48.738
He's not on the list.

01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:51.575
Oh, he's my baker,
and my neighbor.

01:04:51.577 --> 01:04:52.708
He's not on the list.

01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:54.478
It's okay, Sam.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.679
He smells nice,
and he looks good.

01:04:56.681 --> 01:04:58.384
Thanks, Joseph. Have a nice day.

01:05:09.527 --> 01:05:12.362
By the power vested in me
by the state of Illinois,

01:05:12.364 --> 01:05:14.764
I now pronounce you
life partners.

01:05:14.766 --> 01:05:17.236
Pronounce you life partners!

01:05:17.836 --> 01:05:20.570
- Did she say yes?
- May you go in peace.

01:05:20.572 --> 01:05:22.375
They're going in peace.

01:05:34.519 --> 01:05:35.686
Firm yes on the altar.

01:05:35.688 --> 01:05:36.854
Ferret on the move, people.
Be ready.

01:05:36.856 --> 01:05:38.588
That's a confirmed yes
on the altar.

01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:40.423
Ferret is on the move, people.

01:05:40.425 --> 01:05:41.527
<i>Let's go. Confirm.</i>

01:05:42.161 --> 01:05:44.164
- Who is Ferret?
- I don't know.

01:05:44.597 --> 01:05:46.229
Yes, we confirm.

01:05:46.231 --> 01:05:48.298
Ferret is on the move. Over.

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:50.336
- Who are you calling Ferret?
- Billie.

01:05:50.603 --> 01:05:52.769
Literally the only person
we care about now.

01:05:52.771 --> 01:05:54.338
But why are you calling
her Ferret?

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:55.341
Because she's...

01:05:55.708 --> 01:05:56.740
She's ferry.

01:05:56.742 --> 01:05:59.309
Ferret is on the move, people!
Can I get a copy?

01:05:59.311 --> 01:06:01.213
- Who's Ferret?
- Billie!

01:06:01.547 --> 01:06:02.612
She's ferrety.

01:06:02.614 --> 01:06:04.414
I got it under control.

01:06:07.318 --> 01:06:08.552
Oh, dear.

01:06:08.554 --> 01:06:09.853
There's no call for that.

01:06:09.855 --> 01:06:11.554
They sound very stressed.

01:06:11.556 --> 01:06:13.490
Ah, they need raspberry.

01:06:13.492 --> 01:06:14.724
Raspberry marker.

01:06:14.726 --> 01:06:16.228
No, really, Sam, it'll help.

01:06:16.427 --> 01:06:17.760
It'll help calm you down, Sam.

01:06:17.762 --> 01:06:18.829
Sam, what...? Sam.

01:06:18.831 --> 01:06:20.363
<i>...in control.</i>

01:06:21.699 --> 01:06:23.666
It's not about you,
Mom. Just be nice.

01:06:23.668 --> 01:06:25.269
Time for family pictures.

01:06:25.271 --> 01:06:26.903
Step lively, folks.

01:06:26.905 --> 01:06:29.673
We've got a lot
of family pictures here, so...

01:06:29.675 --> 01:06:31.510
Are you going to tell me
what's going on?

01:06:32.411 --> 01:06:33.378
What? Nothing.

01:06:34.213 --> 01:06:35.479
Why were you late?

01:06:35.481 --> 01:06:36.713
Did you get caught up
in the march?

01:06:36.715 --> 01:06:38.916
Patty's been freaking out
about traffic.

01:06:38.918 --> 01:06:40.217
Step lively!

01:06:40.219 --> 01:06:41.851
- Lots of family pictures
- Uh, no.

01:06:41.853 --> 01:06:43.889
I just... I had to...
I had to poop.

01:06:44.556 --> 01:06:45.856
Groom's family first.

01:06:45.858 --> 01:06:47.858
So... Billie,
you're the groom-bride.

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:48.795
Let's go.

01:06:50.628 --> 01:06:51.597
Are you okay?

01:06:52.532 --> 01:06:54.798
Yeah, I just have to...
I have to poop.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.735
Again.

01:06:56.467 --> 01:06:57.601
I'll be right back.

01:06:57.603 --> 01:06:59.606
Billie!
Billie, where are you going?

01:07:01.639 --> 01:07:04.243
Did she eat something weird
at your place last night?

01:07:04.476 --> 01:07:05.411
Yeah.

01:07:06.311 --> 01:07:08.213
Yeah, she ate something
really weird.

01:07:08.447 --> 01:07:10.282
Like...

01:07:15.721 --> 01:07:16.686
Really bad.

01:07:16.688 --> 01:07:18.290
Gayle, come line up, dear.

01:07:18.556 --> 01:07:20.893
Okay, that's... gross.

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:23.762
You know what?
Get a hold of yourself!

01:07:29.534 --> 01:07:31.170
Okay, just...

01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:32.572
How we doing?

01:07:32.871 --> 01:07:33.936
Good. We're great.

01:07:33.938 --> 01:07:36.005
People are starting to show up,
so that's good.

01:07:36.007 --> 01:07:38.307
Did you know there was
a parade in Chicago?

01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:39.775
Gayle's wondering
what's going on.

01:07:39.777 --> 01:07:41.545
Oh, ah, okay. So what'd you say?

01:07:41.547 --> 01:07:43.449
That I had to poop.
And then I ran away.

01:07:43.916 --> 01:07:45.548
Okay, that's specific and gross.

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:47.386
- Poop happens.
- Yeah, well, I poop, too.

01:07:47.585 --> 01:07:49.521
I think you should
just tell her the truth.

01:07:49.822 --> 01:07:51.257
You know? Stop the lying.

01:07:51.724 --> 01:07:52.692
Soon.

01:07:53.525 --> 01:07:54.860
Okay.

01:07:56.795 --> 01:07:57.894
Larry.

01:07:57.896 --> 01:07:59.566
I need you to go. For Gayle.

01:07:59.831 --> 01:08:01.433
Gayle. Remember? Gayle.

01:08:01.666 --> 01:08:03.202
Gayle. Bride. Please?

01:08:03.568 --> 01:08:05.401
Isn't Billie beautiful?

01:08:05.403 --> 01:08:06.436
I know, it's...

01:08:06.438 --> 01:08:08.607
No, no, no! You guys
need to be doing nametags.

01:08:08.907 --> 01:08:10.340
Oh, we did nametags.

01:08:10.342 --> 01:08:11.474
But there weren't
that many people.

01:08:11.476 --> 01:08:12.876
This parade came out of nowhere.

01:08:12.878 --> 01:08:13.880
Yes, okay.

01:08:14.847 --> 01:08:16.045
If they have a nametag,
give them another.

01:08:16.046 --> 01:08:17.913
Give everyone a nametag.

01:08:17.916 --> 01:08:19.415
What if they're not on the list?

01:08:19.417 --> 01:08:20.916
It's not a club,
so we let people in.

01:08:20.917 --> 01:08:23.221
Just smile. Okay? Be warm.

01:08:23.587 --> 01:08:24.754
- No hugs.
- Oh.

01:08:24.756 --> 01:08:26.622
No hugs for me
or anyone else.

01:08:26.625 --> 01:08:28.560
Okay. But what if I know them?

01:08:28.859 --> 01:08:30.828
Still kinda creepy,
I'm sure, somewhere.

01:08:31.563 --> 01:08:32.497
Nope.

01:08:34.365 --> 01:08:35.264
Okay, right.

01:08:35.265 --> 01:08:37.800
Then swing it
all the way to the right.

01:08:37.801 --> 01:08:39.435
Push me. Yeah, like that! Yeah!

01:08:39.438 --> 01:08:41.437
- Like this, like that...
- Stop fighting!

01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:43.341
Well, you know, I was...

01:08:43.774 --> 01:08:45.608
Okay, she's stressed.
She's stressed.

01:08:45.609 --> 01:08:47.477
Oh wait, I think she needs lips.

01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:48.944
- No, she doesn't need...
- Lips!

01:08:48.947 --> 01:08:50.647
- She's not here, so...
- I'm here.

01:08:50.649 --> 01:08:52.948
- I'm here.
- Ooh, great. Okay.

01:08:52.951 --> 01:08:54.785
So, just... You ready?

01:08:54.787 --> 01:08:55.852
Yeah, sorry.

01:08:55.854 --> 01:08:57.321
What! Don't...

01:08:59.890 --> 01:09:01.758
Okay. Great, okay.

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:03.496
George, can we just snap a few?

01:09:03.895 --> 01:09:05.796
How was your second poo?

01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:07.332
It was great.

01:09:07.599 --> 01:09:08.635
- Very satisfying.
- Mm.

01:09:08.934 --> 01:09:10.533
It's a yin and a yang.

01:09:10.536 --> 01:09:11.701
You have to have a yin and yang,

01:09:11.703 --> 01:09:13.903
and you can't have two yangs
or two yins.

01:09:13.904 --> 01:09:15.638
Smile.

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.341
That's fine, I'm seeing someone.

01:09:17.676 --> 01:09:20.109
Did you eat something weird
at Cynthia's last night?

01:09:20.112 --> 01:09:21.144
- Smile.
- Smile.

01:09:21.145 --> 01:09:23.548
You think it was the tilapia?

01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:26.450
Let's get a few
with the two of you

01:09:26.452 --> 01:09:27.951
- facing each other.
- Lips!

01:09:31.457 --> 01:09:32.488
Stop.

01:09:34.493 --> 01:09:35.528
God!

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.930
And are you okay now?

01:09:38.497 --> 01:09:40.767
Yeah.
I just need about 28 minutes.

01:09:41.466 --> 01:09:43.366
That's... specific.

01:09:43.368 --> 01:09:44.835
Uh, here.

01:09:44.837 --> 01:09:45.935
- Hold my spot.
- What?

01:09:45.938 --> 01:09:47.636
- Oh...
- Oh, no, sir!

01:09:47.639 --> 01:09:49.038
- No, excuse me, no, sir.
- No.

01:09:49.041 --> 01:09:50.473
- Ah, Billie...
- Sir, no.

01:09:50.475 --> 01:09:52.008
- You can't be there.
- Um... okay.

01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:53.509
I just want her to look pretty!

01:09:53.511 --> 01:09:54.844
Get your ass...!

01:09:54.846 --> 01:09:56.979
Eyes here!

01:09:56.981 --> 01:09:58.180
I need you to focus!

01:09:58.182 --> 01:10:00.987
The fuck is wrong with you guys?
I told you to be discreet.

01:10:02.421 --> 01:10:04.086
I am discreet!

01:10:04.088 --> 01:10:05.792
I just wanted to...

01:10:06.158 --> 01:10:08.023
The Ferret is on the move.

01:10:08.025 --> 01:10:09.558
Now you like the word "ferret."

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.460
This one is honeysuckle rose,

01:10:11.462 --> 01:10:13.562
but it really has
a raspberry tone to it.

01:10:13.564 --> 01:10:15.665
<i>The Ferret is on the move!</i>

01:10:15.667 --> 01:10:16.732
- I played a trick on you,
- Uh-oh

01:10:16.734 --> 01:10:17.968
but I think it was strawberry.

01:10:17.970 --> 01:10:19.835
Thank you, thank you so much
for coming.

01:10:19.837 --> 01:10:21.036
If you just step inside,

01:10:21.038 --> 01:10:23.005
our CFO will get you
a welcome packet.

01:10:23.007 --> 01:10:24.040
Thank you.

01:10:24.042 --> 01:10:25.545
- Enjoy.
- Thank you for coming.

01:10:26.912 --> 01:10:27.843
- June!
- What?

01:10:27.845 --> 01:10:29.513
Stop smelling the markers!

01:10:29.515 --> 01:10:30.548
They're for the nametags.

01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:32.915
Billie, it helps calm people.

01:10:32.917 --> 01:10:34.116
We are calm!

01:10:34.118 --> 01:10:35.785
Just... stop.

01:10:35.787 --> 01:10:37.420
You don't have a calm tone.

01:10:37.422 --> 01:10:39.125
You look lovely.

01:10:40.759 --> 01:10:41.560
I'm sorry.

01:10:42.594 --> 01:10:44.561
Who let her have the markers?

01:10:44.563 --> 01:10:46.028
What?
You pick your battles, okay?

01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:47.731
She likes the markers,
I let her sniff them.

01:10:47.733 --> 01:10:48.868
What are you doing here?

01:10:49.768 --> 01:10:50.901
Spit out the cookie.

01:10:50.903 --> 01:10:52.739
You're supposed to be
with Gayle. Spit out the cookie.

01:10:53.538 --> 01:10:55.474
Go, go. Find her, find Gayle.

01:10:56.041 --> 01:10:57.540
- Okay, that was mean.
- Whew.

01:10:57.542 --> 01:10:58.607
- I didn't mean to be aggressive.
- No...

01:10:58.609 --> 01:11:00.509
I'm just, ah... It's hot.

01:11:00.511 --> 01:11:01.678
Okay!

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.580
So, since the groom-bride
is M.I.A.,

01:11:04.582 --> 01:11:07.584
I guess we'll just do some
with the bride-bride

01:11:07.586 --> 01:11:10.490
and the mother and father
of the bride-bride.

01:11:10.922 --> 01:11:12.789
Okay, uh, where's your father?

01:11:12.791 --> 01:11:15.025
Oh, where he always is,
in the bar.

01:11:15.027 --> 01:11:17.527
Apparently, he felt a scotch

01:11:17.529 --> 01:11:18.894
was more important than photos.

01:11:18.896 --> 01:11:20.162
- Mom...
- I can step in.

01:11:20.164 --> 01:11:21.665
- I'll do that.
- Cynthia.

01:11:21.667 --> 01:11:22.799
- Happy to.
- Cynthia.

01:11:22.801 --> 01:11:23.733
- Just be a...
- No.

01:11:23.735 --> 01:11:25.168
- Three ladies?
- Get out of there.

01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:26.139
Okay.

01:11:27.072 --> 01:11:29.104
I need a drink.

01:11:29.106 --> 01:11:31.040
- Okay... smile!
- Just like your father.

01:11:31.042 --> 01:11:33.610
Mm, I don't think so.

01:11:33.612 --> 01:11:35.845
I don't know why you would have
a parade in Chicago

01:11:35.847 --> 01:11:37.781
just to have a parade
because it's a city.

01:11:37.783 --> 01:11:39.752
- You know? You have...
- Gillian?

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.789
Mom. Hi.

01:11:44.989 --> 01:11:47.426
Did you put all
of this together?

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.763
- Well... we did.
- We did.

01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:53.064
This is
my business partner, Billie.

01:11:53.631 --> 01:11:54.731
I'm so happy to see you

01:11:54.733 --> 01:11:57.601
finally doing something
productive with your life!

01:11:57.603 --> 01:11:58.535
Thanks.

01:11:58.537 --> 01:12:00.603
Oh, so nice to meet you...

01:12:00.605 --> 01:12:01.771
Vivian.

01:12:01.773 --> 01:12:03.109
Nice to meet you, too.

01:12:03.641 --> 01:12:04.976
I'm actually here to invest.

01:12:05.577 --> 01:12:06.512
Invest?

01:12:06.811 --> 01:12:07.977
You really want to invest?

01:12:07.979 --> 01:12:10.115
- Of course!
- Wait, this is your mom?

01:12:12.551 --> 01:12:14.284
My family owns
Hillsbury Farms, so...

01:12:14.286 --> 01:12:15.721
Hillsbury Farms?

01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.853
Part of Big Strawberry.
Do you know it?

01:12:17.855 --> 01:12:20.223
We work with Cyn
over at Market Media Outreach,

01:12:20.225 --> 01:12:22.025
she mentioned
that an app like yours

01:12:22.027 --> 01:12:23.596
would help us tremendously.

01:12:23.962 --> 01:12:26.095
I made a few initial inquiries,

01:12:26.097 --> 01:12:27.966
and, bottom line,

01:12:28.634 --> 01:12:30.599
Big Strawberry
is prepared to offer you

01:12:30.601 --> 01:12:33.003
seventy-five thousand dollars
to develop your app.

01:12:33.005 --> 01:12:34.138
Seventy-five...

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.539
- Seventy-five thousand dollars?
- Oh, oh...

01:12:36.675 --> 01:12:37.810
Excuse me.

01:12:38.710 --> 01:12:40.480
This is high priority.

01:12:41.012 --> 01:12:42.012
Thank you.

01:12:42.014 --> 01:12:43.682
Wait, your family's rich?

01:12:43.981 --> 01:12:45.048
We're very rich.

01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:46.782
Why do you drive
such a shitty car

01:12:46.784 --> 01:12:48.183
if your family's part
of Big Strawberry?

01:12:48.185 --> 01:12:51.090
My therapist said
it would make me more relatable.

01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:53.990
Here I thought
you were all tough and scrappy

01:12:53.992 --> 01:12:55.925
like some sort
of grown-up Oliver Twist,

01:12:55.927 --> 01:12:58.327
but really you're like
the anti-Oliver Twist.

01:12:58.329 --> 01:13:00.030
You're, like, not a child

01:13:00.032 --> 01:13:02.768
who was taught how to steal
things by a creepy old man.

01:13:03.001 --> 01:13:04.668
I bet you're not an alcoholic.

01:13:04.670 --> 01:13:06.271
I'm a raging alcoholic.

01:13:07.038 --> 01:13:09.242
Yes. Since she was 12.

01:13:13.744 --> 01:13:15.711
- Here, here. I'm here.
- Oh, yay!

01:13:26.792 --> 01:13:28.794
Hi, hello. Hi.

01:13:29.161 --> 01:13:31.594
I want to thank everyone
for coming this evening.

01:13:31.596 --> 01:13:33.162
And before we get started,

01:13:33.164 --> 01:13:36.165
I just wanted to take a minute
to introduce someone

01:13:36.167 --> 01:13:38.737
that without
we wouldn't be here right now.

01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:41.004
So, let me welcome to the stage

01:13:41.006 --> 01:13:43.042
the CEO
of Freelancers Anonymous,

01:13:43.341 --> 01:13:46.077
and my friend, Billie Kingston.

01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:55.085
- I'm starving.
- Bride-bride is hungry?

01:13:55.087 --> 01:13:57.890
Don't worry. I have some candies
in the back room.

01:13:58.823 --> 01:14:00.889
Excuse me, sir. Do me a favor.

01:14:00.891 --> 01:14:02.058
Run to the back room

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:05.064
and bring me back my box
of beautifully wrapped candies.

01:14:05.329 --> 01:14:07.998
They're in a blue, reusable bag
under the corner table.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:08.898
It has a picture

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:10.834
of a cartoon bird
playing the harmonica.

01:14:10.836 --> 01:14:14.771
It's about yea big,
and it's next to a green bag.

01:14:14.773 --> 01:14:17.139
But don't touch the green bag.
That's personal.

01:14:17.141 --> 01:14:18.344
Only the blue bag.

01:14:19.711 --> 01:14:21.247
- Well, go.
- I need a...

01:14:21.646 --> 01:14:23.146
Can we go
into the reception hall

01:14:23.148 --> 01:14:25.147
and grab some hors d'oeuvres
or something?

01:14:25.149 --> 01:14:26.318
Paul?

01:14:27.485 --> 01:14:31.120
My timeline says some group
called Freelancers Anonymous

01:14:31.122 --> 01:14:32.222
- reserved the room...
- Freelancers...?

01:14:32.224 --> 01:14:34.824
...right up
until we start the reception.

01:14:34.826 --> 01:14:35.994
Shit!

01:14:36.795 --> 01:14:38.727
Gayle, where are you going?
Stop!

01:14:38.729 --> 01:14:40.098
Bride-bride on the loose!

01:14:47.005 --> 01:14:50.009
<i>Otter's on the loose!
Come in, come in, come in!</i>

01:14:50.375 --> 01:14:51.907
There's an otter loose.

01:14:51.909 --> 01:14:52.811
Oh, no.

01:14:59.685 --> 01:15:00.886
...mobile force.

01:15:01.153 --> 01:15:03.119
Here at Freelancers Anonymous,

01:15:03.121 --> 01:15:05.821
our mission is to connect women

01:15:05.823 --> 01:15:07.993

01:15:08.225 --> 01:15:10.994
with businesses that share
in our goal

01:15:10.996 --> 01:15:13.196
to close the gender and pay gap

01:15:13.198 --> 01:15:15.098
for women in technology.

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:17.133
Thing is,

01:15:17.135 --> 01:15:19.068
we want to provide resources

01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:21.172

looking for employment,

01:15:21.439 --> 01:15:24.909
and the opportunity for you
to be a part of the solution.

01:15:26.243 --> 01:15:29.914
<i>Our strategy is to curate

<i>A women-driven startup</i>

01:15:40.292 --> 01:15:41.927
at Freelancers Anonymous.

01:15:42.493 --> 01:15:44.259
- Corn!
- Billie!

01:15:49.266 --> 01:15:50.935
Billie!

01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:53.906
The Otter is here!

01:15:54.805 --> 01:15:55.907
What the hell is this?

01:15:56.975 --> 01:16:00.880
Everyone, this is my wife Gayle.

01:16:01.412 --> 01:16:03.012
She's beautiful.

01:16:03.014 --> 01:16:04.147
Stop... stop clapping.

01:16:05.382 --> 01:16:07.219
Would you like a nametag, dear?

01:16:07.819 --> 01:16:09.285
What? No.

01:16:09.287 --> 01:16:10.519
- Never mind.
- So...

01:16:10.521 --> 01:16:11.957
So, I can explain.

01:16:13.091 --> 01:16:14.927
Oh, you can explain?
You don't have to go poo again?

01:16:15.292 --> 01:16:17.160
That's a specific question.

01:16:17.162 --> 01:16:18.861
- You can take something for it.
- Uh...

01:16:18.863 --> 01:16:20.129
You have spent
the last few months

01:16:20.131 --> 01:16:21.531
lying to my face!

01:16:21.533 --> 01:16:23.369
- Gayle, what is going on?
- Not now, Mom!

01:16:25.537 --> 01:16:26.706
Who are these people?

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:30.106
- They're here for my company.
- What company?

01:16:30.108 --> 01:16:31.844
Freelancers Anonymous.

01:16:32.109 --> 01:16:34.510
Billie, please stop lying.

01:16:34.512 --> 01:16:35.611
It's true.

01:16:35.613 --> 01:16:37.914
I was waiting until
the launch party to tell you,

01:16:37.916 --> 01:16:39.281
but I wanted to show you
what I could do.

01:16:39.283 --> 01:16:41.183
I lied, but I lied for the good.

01:16:41.185 --> 01:16:42.384
What does that mean?

01:16:42.386 --> 01:16:44.456
It means
I was doing something for us.

01:16:45.055 --> 01:16:47.456
This isn't a game, Billie!
This is our life!

01:16:47.458 --> 01:16:49.828
I know.
Are you happy we got married?

01:16:50.261 --> 01:16:51.294
Ooh...

01:16:51.296 --> 01:16:54.133
Am I happy we got married?

01:16:57.502 --> 01:16:59.468
I fucking love you, you moron!

01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:00.903
Well, I love you, too!

01:17:00.905 --> 01:17:02.839
- Well then, great!
- Great!

01:17:02.841 --> 01:17:04.440
- Okay!
- Awesome!

01:17:04.442 --> 01:17:05.575
Why are we yelling?

01:17:05.577 --> 01:17:08.314
Because you yelled at me,
so I'm yelling back at you!

01:17:08.846 --> 01:17:09.948
That's fair!

01:17:10.515 --> 01:17:12.315
- Okay.
- Okay...

01:17:12.317 --> 01:17:15.184
Yes, so we have
investors, is the thing, so...

01:17:15.186 --> 01:17:16.889
Nice to meet you,
you look stunning.

01:17:20.158 --> 01:17:21.924
So, this is,
like, a real company?

01:17:21.926 --> 01:17:24.829
Yeah, this is really happening.

01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:26.396
I found my thing.

01:17:26.398 --> 01:17:28.197
You can say goodbye
to Anne Westgate.

01:17:30.402 --> 01:17:32.037
I fucking love you.

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:36.909
You know Anne Westgate?

01:17:37.609 --> 01:17:39.308
Who is Anne Westgate?

01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:40.512
Are they in a threesome?

01:17:40.979 --> 01:17:42.411
That's hot, actually.

01:17:44.315 --> 01:17:46.148
We have so much to celebrate

01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:48.052
at the office on Monday.

01:17:48.286 --> 01:17:50.021
- I'll make a cake.
- No.

01:17:52.591 --> 01:17:54.994
Oh. Okay, that resolved quickly.

01:17:56.027 --> 01:17:57.328
I found them!

01:17:58.430 --> 01:18:00.065

- You'll be late. Go!
- All right.

01:18:21.051 --> 01:18:22.822
- Go be a boss lady.
- Okay.
