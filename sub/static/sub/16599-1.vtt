No, you're not.

You're gonna be all right.

anyone was in here.

01:21.148 --> 01:22.314
That's all right.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.682
Hey, I can leave if...

01:23.684 --> 01:25.684
No, it's okay. I...

01:25.686 --> 01:27.619
I can use the company.

01:27.621 --> 01:31.156
Okay.

01:31.158 --> 01:33.859
My wife's in surgery.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.461
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:35.463 --> 01:38.263
She beat cancer
a few years back,

01:38.265 --> 01:41.400
and put up with me
for 45 years,

01:41.402 --> 01:43.869

a walk in the park.

Work related injury.

01:55.216 --> 01:59.618
If you don't mind me asking,
what type of work do you do?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.620
I'm, uh...
I'm in law enforcement.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.222
Five-O task force.

02:03.224 --> 02:06.258
Hmm.

02:06.260 --> 02:09.194
What?

02:10.164 --> 02:12.898
I was a cop, too.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.801
Long time ago.

02:16.770 --> 02:19.138
Okay, I'm sorry.

02:19.140 --> 02:22.141
You were a cop?

02:22.143 --> 02:24.309
You've been married
for 45 years?

02:24.311 --> 02:25.777
What's your secret?

02:25.779 --> 02:27.746
No secret.

02:27.748 --> 02:31.250
I just met the right gal.

02:32.219 --> 02:34.453
Huh.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.821
What about you?

02:35.823 --> 02:38.190
You married? Girlfriend?

02:38.192 --> 02:40.926
No.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.228
Well, I'm sure
the right woman's

02:43.230 --> 02:44.730
out there for you somewhere.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.667
What if I already met
the right woman,

02:48.669 --> 02:51.270
and, uh, and I couldn't
hang on to her?

02:52.606 --> 02:53.772
Then she wasn't the right woman.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.641
Yeah, see,
I'm not so sure about that.

03:00.915 --> 03:03.649
Sometimes it feels like

03:03.651 --> 03:08.820
this job of mine has taken
everything good from me.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.824
I've been wearing the badge
for six years,

03:12.826 --> 03:15.194
and I'm really
starting to wonder whether...

03:15.196 --> 03:17.196
whether any of it's worth it.

03:17.198 --> 03:21.433
Son, what we do
can't be quantified.

03:21.435 --> 03:24.970
Your worth is measured
in the closure you bring,

03:24.972 --> 03:26.638
the people you save.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.208
That's your real legacy.

03:29.210 --> 03:32.344
And the best legacy
a man can leave behind

03:32.346 --> 03:35.647
is the people whose
lives he's changed.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.253
Trust me.

04:08.315 --> 04:10.315

04:10.317 --> 04:12.351

04:12.353 --> 04:14.286

04:14.288 --> 04:16.555

04:22.696 --> 04:24.830
Italy?

04:24.832 --> 04:27.466
No, no, no, no.
Look. That's a T-Rex.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.372

04:33.374 --> 04:34.640
I thought that was Venice.

04:34.642 --> 04:38.310
That... How do you even know
where Venice...?

04:38.312 --> 04:40.479

11:57.250 --> 11:59.017
I'm not the person
who almost died, okay?

11:59.019 --> 12:00.051
That was you.
(clears throat)

12:00.053 --> 12:01.603
And you heard what
the doctor said,

12:01.604 --> 12:03.154
you are still
in the evaluation period.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.823
That's two to three months, okay?
Mm-hmm.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.441
You're not supposed to even be
driving a car.

12:06.442 --> 12:08.058
You're not supposed to operate
any machinery. Oh, no, no...

12:08.061 --> 12:09.728
Uh, no, that's a suggestion.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.129
That's-- they make suggestions.
Oh, yeah?

12:11.131 --> 12:12.647
Let me tell you something.

12:12.648 --> 12:14.164
If your body rejects my liver
because you're not

12:14.167 --> 12:15.900
taking this seriously,
I'm gonna be very upset.

12:15.902 --> 12:19.003
You're gonna be very
upset if it takes or not.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.906
Six hours.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.843
"Six hours." Six hours I
laid on an operating table,

12:24.845 --> 12:27.011
while a team of doctors
picked at my insides

12:27.013 --> 12:29.180
and took out a vital organ
to give to you.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.149
Be grateful. Don't be ungrateful.
Here we go.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.884
Here we go. "Here we go," what
does that mean, "Here we go"?

12:32.886 --> 12:34.252
This is donor's remorse.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.920
"Donor's remorse"? It's-it's
classic donor's remorse.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.323
What are you talking-- I'm just
saying show some respect!

12:38.325 --> 12:41.126
Have some genuine respect
for my liver, okay?

12:41.128 --> 12:42.861
And follow the rules,
that's all.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.229
(mutters): Your liver. Yeah.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.830
Let me tell you something,
all right?

12:45.832 --> 12:46.831
Possession

12:46.833 --> 12:48.166
is nine-tenths of the law,

12:48.168 --> 12:50.185
okay, buddy?

12:50.186 --> 12:52.203
And now since your liver
is in my body, Mm-hmm.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.873
you got no say in how I
treat it, how about that?

12:54.875 --> 12:57.175
That's the stupidest thing I've
ever heard in my entire life.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.227
Okay?

12:59.228 --> 13:01.278
I don't think that goes
for, uh, organ donations, okay?

13:01.281 --> 13:03.298
I don't think it applies!

13:03.299 --> 13:05.316
But if it does, I think
that we should change the law.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.819
In the meantime,
I'd like my liver back please.

13:07.821 --> 13:08.987
(tires screech)

13:09.890 --> 13:10.955
What are you doing?

13:11.458 --> 13:12.991
(seat belt alarm beeps)

13:12.993 --> 13:14.325
We're switching places.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.063
(groans)

13:19.065 --> 13:20.298
Let's go.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.333
You're gonna let me drive?

13:22.335 --> 13:24.169
No, I'm gonna shut you
up, is what I'm gonna do.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.170
Let's go.

13:25.172 --> 13:28.039
I can't drive.
What?

13:28.041 --> 13:29.040
I just-- I can't drive.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.041
Can't drive?
No.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.043
All these years

13:32.045 --> 13:34.179
you're on at me about
driving and now you say no?

13:34.181 --> 13:35.547
(clicks tongue)
Yeah.

13:35.549 --> 13:38.183
Doctor said I can't drive
for about a week. Ah.

13:38.185 --> 13:41.853
Okay, well, I guess we'll just
backburner this case until then.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.254
That's obviously not an option.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.390
Very good, what do
you suggest we do?

13:47.994 --> 13:50.061
(sighs)

13:51.231 --> 13:53.464
Oh, this thing handles great.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.271
<i> (engine shuts off, doors open)</i>

14:03.343 --> 14:06.144
Door left open.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.412
Clearly signs of a struggle.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.447
He could've been killed here.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.053
DANNY:
Steve.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.888
Yeah?
Got a torn dry cleaning bag.

14:16.890 --> 14:17.956
(glove snaps)

14:22.295 --> 14:23.962
(gasping)

14:23.964 --> 14:26.931
Chin was right,
this is our primary crime scene.

14:26.933 --> 14:31.236
This guy Hein, he, uh,
worked at a car wash, right?

14:31.238 --> 14:32.637
Wh-why's he got
a hotel uniform?

14:33.607 --> 14:36.241
I got two keys here from
the Palekaiko Resort and Spa.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.943
This one's got blood on it.

14:42.616 --> 14:45.350
All right, guys, the manager
just confirmed the keys we found

14:45.352 --> 14:46.918
belong to two rooms
currently occupied.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.987
All right, let's go.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.457
All right, we'll check out
the 12th floor.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.925
You guys hit 21.
(elevator bell dings)

14:53.927 --> 14:55.360
Let us know what you find.

14:59.432 --> 15:02.400
(phone rings)

15:02.402 --> 15:03.668
Lieutenant Kelly.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.552
What was that about?

15:21.554 --> 15:26.357
Child Services found
Sara's family in Mexico.

15:26.359 --> 15:29.394
And you're doing your
own background check.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.362
I know, I know,

15:31.364 --> 15:34.666
I'm being overprotective,
but she's 'ohana now, right?

15:34.668 --> 15:37.201
You got the bug, cuz.

15:37.203 --> 15:39.637
(elevator bell dings)
What are you talking about?

15:39.639 --> 15:41.239
Sara's given you a taste
of fatherhood

15:41.241 --> 15:43.308
and now you want
a little one of your own.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.344
I'm not gonna lie,

15:46.346 --> 15:48.046
it has crossed my mind.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.515
Well, now that Abby's
here for good,

15:50.517 --> 15:53.284
what are you waiting for?

15:53.286 --> 15:55.453
Auntie Kono.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.522
Ooh, I like the sound of that.
(chuckles)

15:58.725 --> 16:01.059
(softly):
Okay.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.528
Mr. and Mrs. Goodman?

16:03.530 --> 16:05.430
STEVE:
<i> My name is</i>

16:05.432 --> 16:07.732
Commander Steve McGarrett,
I'm with the Five-O task force.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.651
Mr. and Mrs. Goodman,

16:09.652 --> 16:11.569
you mind if we come in
and ask you a few questions?

16:18.678 --> 16:20.578
(beeps)

16:28.488 --> 16:30.455
WOMAN (on TV):
Aloha.

16:30.457 --> 16:34.459
I'm Keiko Mahoe, newly elected
governor of Hawaii.

16:34.461 --> 16:38.029
And I am here to personally
welcome you

16:38.031 --> 16:41.566
to a Oahu, the third largest
of the Hawaiian Islands.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.505
You're not just a tourist,
(phone rings)

16:47.507 --> 16:49.574
you're 'ohana.

16:51.077 --> 16:54.145
With over 250 properties...
Chin, what do we got?

16:54.147 --> 16:55.480
We got two dead bodies here.

16:55.482 --> 16:59.183
They've each had
their eyes gouged out.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.419
We got exactly
the same thing here.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.555
Anthony Hein was
a serial killer.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.492
You know, maybe whoever
murdered him knew that

17:07.494 --> 17:09.727
before we did. MAHOE (on TV):
When you come to Hawaii,

17:09.729 --> 17:10.795
you're not just a tourist,
you're 'ohana.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.089
Are we sure these murders
are connected?

17:38.091 --> 17:40.158
Yes, ma'am,
they're the same M.O.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.094
(indistinct radio chatter,
camera shutter clicking)

17:48.735 --> 17:51.169
We believe it's
the work of this man.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.071
Who is he?

17:53.073 --> 17:54.672
I'm sure you heard
about the body

17:54.674 --> 17:56.340
we found at the Palace
this morning.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.542
That was this guy?

17:57.544 --> 17:59.661
Yes, ma'am.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.779
Lab found traces of all four
victims' blood on his clothing.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.849
It doesn't appear that

18:04.851 --> 18:07.752
either of the couples
knew each other.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.654
There were no valuables missing
at either of the crime scenes.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.657
So far, everything's pointing
towards this being serial.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.394
Why the eyes?

18:16.396 --> 18:18.429
We believe it has something
to do with the fact

18:18.431 --> 18:20.315
that they were tourists.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.200
Here to admire
our beautiful island.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.835
Yes, ma'am.

18:23.837 --> 18:25.536
(Mahoe sighs)

18:25.538 --> 18:27.805
So this guy murders four people
within days of each other

18:27.807 --> 18:30.808
at the same hotel,
then turns up dead?

18:30.810 --> 18:32.577
What's going on here, Commander?

18:32.579 --> 18:34.095
We're not sure.

18:34.096 --> 18:35.612
Could be a vigilante,
maybe this guy had a partner

18:35.615 --> 18:38.249
who turned on him, we just...
we don't know yet.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.594
We need to keep what
happened here from the press.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.829
If people think they can't be
safe in their hotel rooms,

18:51.831 --> 18:55.366
we jeopardize the one thing
this island relies on the most.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.902
We cover this up and
another tourist is killed,

18:57.904 --> 18:59.604
then what?

18:59.606 --> 19:01.239
What do we do then?

19:01.241 --> 19:03.774
Commander, Governor Denning
told me two things

19:03.776 --> 19:05.143
when I moved into this office.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.329
The first was,

19:07.330 --> 19:09.514
"Never go to an event without
two copies of a speech."

19:09.516 --> 19:10.848
The second was,

19:10.850 --> 19:14.919
"Don't ever underestimate
the Five-O task force."

19:14.921 --> 19:18.289
That's why I'm here, to tell you
that you have my full support.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.825
So do your job and make sure
this doesn't happen again.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.334
ERIC:
<i> CSU recovered</i>

19:30.336 --> 19:31.736
Hein's cellphone from his house.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.571
And it turns out he recorded
both hotel murders

19:33.573 --> 19:35.706
and sent the recordings
to someone via e-mail.

19:35.708 --> 19:36.741
You know who?

19:36.743 --> 19:38.643
No, not yet.

19:38.644 --> 19:40.544
Hein used a secure e-mail
provider to send the files,

19:40.547 --> 19:41.879
so everything's encrypted.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.581
McGarrett thinks
he may have had a partner,

19:43.583 --> 19:45.416
so maybe that's who
he sent the recordings to.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.751
Something else.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.286
The hotel murders
weren't the only recordings

19:48.288 --> 19:49.620
stored on the phone.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.655
There was a third recording.

19:50.657 --> 19:53.291
Another murder?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.864
♪ ♪

20:20.687 --> 20:22.687
Sounded like
two different screams.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.255
Could be two more victims
out there.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.656
I also heard some
noise in the background.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.925
Waves crashing,
maybe a plane overhead.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.560
You both have
very good ears, Lieutenant.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.262
Based on the acoustic analysis

20:31.264 --> 20:32.597
I'm thinking that recording
took place

20:32.599 --> 20:34.699
underneath the Honolulu Airport
flight path.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.769
<i> Probably in a house</i>
<i> near Ewa Beach.</i>

20:47.480 --> 20:49.547
Talk about
a needle in a haystack.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.983
(softly):
Yeah.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.355
Chin?

20:59.592 --> 21:01.492
I see it.
Yeah.

21:22.015 --> 21:23.514
WOMAN:
<i> Can you believe this view?</i>

21:23.516 --> 21:25.316
Amazing, right?

21:25.318 --> 21:26.651
Wish you guys were here.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.519
Wait, Justin wants to say hi.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.787
Aloha.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.054
KONO: I talked to the company
that rents the house.

21:31.057 --> 21:33.391
Vics are Justin
and Michelle Lowe.

21:33.393 --> 21:35.426
They're from Bloomington,
Minnesota.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.361
Two more tourists.

21:37.363 --> 21:38.996
Yeah, M.E. estimates that they
were murdered five days ago,

21:38.998 --> 21:41.699
so we have to assume that they
were Hein's first victims.

21:41.701 --> 21:42.767
Right, unless there's
other bodies out there.

21:42.769 --> 21:43.768
STEVE: Tell me
you got something.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.569
Struck out on identifying

21:45.571 --> 21:46.737
who Hein sent the e-mails to.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.172
But I did manage to figure out

21:48.173 --> 21:49.606
that the recipient
opened the account

21:49.607 --> 21:51.040
two days before the
Ewa Beach murders.

21:51.044 --> 21:52.894
Well, that's not a coincidence.

21:52.895 --> 21:54.745
Whoever opened that account
was expecting those e-mails.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.013
All right, so maybe
you were right.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.448
Hein has a partner.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.487
I'm going worldwide
with it, Chicago.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.488
It's time to spread
that aloha.

22:04.490 --> 22:05.489
Mm.

22:05.491 --> 22:06.857
I'm calling it
the Kamekona Klub.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.926
For a very low
subscription rate,

22:08.928 --> 22:11.462
you get a new island
delicacy every month.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.366
Malasadas, garlic shrimp,

22:15.368 --> 22:17.935
local grown coffee, shave ice.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.103
Ooh, shave ice.
Sounds delicious.

22:19.105 --> 22:20.638
How you gonna ship that?

22:20.640 --> 22:22.640
Well, it's still in R&D.

22:22.642 --> 22:25.476
Which is what I'd be using
your capital for.

22:25.478 --> 22:28.346
Mm. Let me explain something
to you, big fella.

22:28.348 --> 22:31.449
I have not one,
but two kids

22:31.451 --> 22:33.451
that have to be put
through college.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.052
All of my capital

22:35.054 --> 22:37.588
is going right into
that bottomless pit.

22:37.590 --> 22:40.991
Bruddah, if you had a chance
to get in

22:40.993 --> 22:44.762
on the ground floor of Google,
you would of taken it, right?

22:44.764 --> 22:47.465
Yes, and what does that
have to do with you?

22:47.467 --> 22:51.001
This is gonna be bigger.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.571
Bigger than Google?

22:53.573 --> 22:56.807
The most valuable
company in the world?

22:56.809 --> 22:58.542
For now.
For...

22:58.544 --> 23:00.878
(laughs)

23:00.880 --> 23:02.012
I got to hand it to you,
big fella.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.013
I tell you what--

23:03.015 --> 23:04.982
let me think about it.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.718
Okay, but
don't take too long.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.054
This friends and family
offer won't last long.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.055
Yeah...

23:11.057 --> 23:12.056
Captain Grover.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.759
Yeah, have a seat.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.028
Give us a minute,
big fella.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.797
You got it.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.870
I don't have much time,
I'm on a deadline.

23:25.872 --> 23:27.171
Yeah, about that.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.873
Um...

23:28.875 --> 23:32.009
look, I know your plan to run
with what happened at the hotel.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.781
On behalf of Five-O, I'm here
to ask you to hold off.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.949
And why would I do that?

23:38.951 --> 23:41.719
Well, for starters,

23:41.721 --> 23:43.654
you're gonna create a panic.

23:43.656 --> 23:44.855
(scoffs)
Or maybe you're worried

23:44.857 --> 23:48.125
that it would embarrass
your task force?

23:48.127 --> 23:49.994
I'd be happy to include
your statement...

23:49.996 --> 23:51.128
for the record.

23:51.130 --> 23:54.665
That's not what
this is about. (sighs)

23:54.667 --> 23:58.836
Captain, Five-O has investigated
over a hundred homicide cases.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.638
The only reason you'd be trying
to suppress this

24:00.640 --> 24:03.974
is because it's more complicated
than just four dead tourists.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.878
Okay, Mr. Reporter,

24:07.880 --> 24:09.513
(recorder beeps)
you're right.

24:09.515 --> 24:10.815
It is more complicated.

24:10.817 --> 24:13.050
Which is why I'm here right now,

24:13.052 --> 24:17.021
asking you to just hold off
for a little while.

24:17.023 --> 24:19.190
When this thing is over,
I promise you,

24:19.192 --> 24:21.959
we will give you
everything you want.

24:23.763 --> 24:24.962
Please.

24:29.836 --> 24:30.901
(car alarm beeps)

24:34.841 --> 24:37.241
Hey, show me your hands!

24:39.779 --> 24:42.246
Buddy, do you want to get shot?

24:42.248 --> 24:44.515
Get out!

24:50.656 --> 24:53.057
STEVE:
We got another one.

24:55.061 --> 24:56.494
Ugh.

24:56.496 --> 24:57.728
What the hell
is the killer

24:57.730 --> 24:59.196
trying to say to us?

24:59.198 --> 25:01.532
I'm afraid I can't help you
with that.

25:01.534 --> 25:02.833
(scanner trills)

25:02.835 --> 25:04.902
But I did get a hit
on this guy's prints.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.672
David Larsen.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.174
<i> (tires screeching)</i>

25:28.995 --> 25:31.695
(gasping)

25:31.697 --> 25:33.898
Call the M.E.'s office.

25:33.900 --> 25:34.932
Tell her we might
have another body.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.901
(exhales)

25:53.753 --> 25:56.787
(flies buzzing)

26:01.961 --> 26:04.929
(muffled breathing)

26:10.970 --> 26:12.036
Oh, my God.

26:20.346 --> 26:22.179
We're hearing
that a total of eight bodies

26:22.181 --> 26:23.213
were found in the basement

26:23.215 --> 26:24.915
of this house in Manoa.
However,

26:24.917 --> 26:26.917
HPD is not responding
to questions at this time.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.053
It's all over the news.
Every station.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.889
Networks on the mainland
have picked up this story.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.691
Multiple airlines are reporting
And what happened at the hotel.

26:33.693 --> 26:34.725
that many travelers are now
cancelling their flights

26:34.727 --> 26:35.893
to Hawaii.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.261
If you're planning
on visiting the islands,

26:37.263 --> 26:39.063
you should probably
ask yourself,

26:39.065 --> 26:40.764
"Is it really worth the risk?"

26:40.766 --> 26:42.933
What the hell is going
on here, Commander?

26:42.935 --> 26:45.336
Were Larsen and Hein
working together?

26:45.338 --> 26:47.004
So far, we have no
evidence of that.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.806
Right now, the only
thing connecting them

26:48.808 --> 26:50.007
is whoever killed them

26:50.009 --> 26:51.609
<i> and dumped their bodies</i>
<i> in our lap.</i>

26:51.611 --> 26:52.810
Commander,

26:52.812 --> 26:55.679
is there a vigilante
on the loose?

26:55.681 --> 26:57.715
We're not sure yet.
But both killers

26:57.717 --> 26:59.917
were murdered the same away.
Both asphyxiated.

26:59.919 --> 27:01.786
That's a pattern, right?

27:01.787 --> 27:03.654
Well, we can't rule out
a serial killer

27:03.656 --> 27:06.340
murdering serial killers.

27:06.341 --> 27:09.025
You said you found photos
on Larsen's phone.

27:09.028 --> 27:10.861
Yeah.
Tell me about those.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.896
David Larsen photographed
all eight victims

27:12.898 --> 27:15.432
before and after
he killed them.

27:15.433 --> 27:17.967
Also, we believe that all
of these vics were local.

27:17.970 --> 27:21.071
Why would he take pictures?
For his own amusement?

27:21.073 --> 27:22.172
It's possible.

27:22.174 --> 27:24.642
These images were graphic,
ma'am.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.713
Much like the audio recordings

27:29.715 --> 27:31.215
that Anthony Lee Hein made.

27:31.217 --> 27:32.934
And like Hein,

27:32.935 --> 27:34.652
we believe that Larsen
was sharing these images

27:34.654 --> 27:37.021
with somebody, possibly the
person who murdered him.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.322
But you can't be sure?

27:38.324 --> 27:39.957
No, ma'am.

27:39.959 --> 27:42.893
But it's safe to say we have
a serial killer on the loose

27:42.895 --> 27:45.029
who is targeting people
like himself.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.997
And somehow, he's onto them

27:46.999 --> 27:48.866
before our own damn
police department.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.100
Like I said, ma'am, we believe

27:50.102 --> 27:51.835
that he was working
with these men.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.270
Which would explain
how he knows.

27:53.272 --> 27:54.738
Commander,

27:54.740 --> 27:57.841
I just spent
the last three hours

27:57.843 --> 27:58.976
with my cabinet, discussing

27:58.978 --> 28:00.811
putting a quarantine
on this island.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.880
But if I do that,

28:02.882 --> 28:04.381
it'll be years before people

28:04.383 --> 28:06.817
think it's safe
to come back here. So,

28:06.819 --> 28:08.686
before I bankrupt this place

28:08.688 --> 28:11.422
and put the fear of God
in our locals,

28:11.424 --> 28:14.158
do for me what you did
for Governor Denning

28:14.160 --> 28:17.361
and make problems like this
go away.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.431
Yes, ma'am.

28:24.003 --> 28:25.903
Hey.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.971
Hey. Just in time. Jerry
says he's got something

28:27.973 --> 28:29.223
on those ivory carvings.

28:29.224 --> 28:30.474
What do you got?
After much digging,

28:30.476 --> 28:32.710
I've come to the conclusion
that those carvings

28:32.712 --> 28:35.245
are modeled after 11th century
chess pieces.

28:35.247 --> 28:36.980
Pawns, to be exact.

28:36.982 --> 28:38.716
Chess?

28:38.718 --> 28:40.884
GROVER: Maybe whoever
knocked off Hein and Larsen

28:40.886 --> 28:41.885
thinks this thing is a game.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.220
Or, he was somehow

28:43.222 --> 28:45.122
using both men to commit murder.

28:45.124 --> 28:46.490
Maybe he considered them
as instruments.

28:46.492 --> 28:47.925
His pawns.

28:47.927 --> 28:48.992
Right, and after they
served their purpose,

28:48.994 --> 28:50.260
he got rid of 'em.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.029
JERRY: Hold that thought.
There's more.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.732
In the course of my research,
I came across an open case

28:54.734 --> 28:55.733
from eight years ago.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.000
A young Kahala couple--

28:57.002 --> 28:59.436
Steve and Marissa Blake--
disappeared,

28:59.438 --> 29:01.905
along with several
high priced items, including

29:01.907 --> 29:04.808
an 11th century-style
walrus ivory chess set.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.411
Look familiar?

29:07.413 --> 29:10.114
Yeah, those are identical
to the ones we recovered.

29:11.784 --> 29:12.916
Any suspects in this case?

29:12.918 --> 29:15.018
One, a Pierre Shaw,
32 years old.

29:15.020 --> 29:18.188
Recently paroled
for possession of stolen goods.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.457
(sobbing):
Please don't hurt me.

29:20.459 --> 29:23.761
Please,
I'll do whatever you want.

29:23.763 --> 29:26.029
(sobbing):
Please.

29:27.032 --> 29:29.199
(breathing shakily)

29:34.974 --> 29:37.374
That's interesting, Steve.

29:40.913 --> 29:43.080
(knocking, door opens)

29:43.082 --> 29:45.516
Sorry, I was on the phone.
Can I, uh,

29:45.518 --> 29:47.484
help you guys?
Yeah, Five-O, Mr. Shaw.

29:47.486 --> 29:50.053
Just wondering if we could
ask you a couple of questions.

29:50.055 --> 29:51.822
Now's not really a good time.
I was just on my way out.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.123
It won't take long at all.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.458
Couple questions.
I'm kind of in a rush.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.392
Maybe we could do this later?

29:55.394 --> 29:57.094
The conditions of your parole

29:57.096 --> 29:58.529
allow us to drop in
whenever we want.

29:58.531 --> 29:59.830
We want to drop in right now.

29:59.832 --> 30:02.199
Is that gonna
be a problem?

30:02.201 --> 30:03.534
(softly):
No.

30:03.536 --> 30:05.102
Thanks.

30:15.481 --> 30:18.048
Anybody else here besides you?

30:18.050 --> 30:19.550
No, sir,
I live alone.

30:19.552 --> 30:22.052
(chains rattling, whimpering)

30:22.054 --> 30:24.521
Look, I really don't know
why you guys are here.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.190
I've been clean
since I got out.

30:26.192 --> 30:27.558
(muffled crying)

30:27.560 --> 30:29.359
Steven and Marissa Blake.

30:29.361 --> 30:32.963
Young couple, went missing
about eight years ago.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.064
You were a suspect in the case.

30:35.067 --> 30:37.334
Yeah, that's right.
(woman grunting)

30:37.336 --> 30:39.336
HPD accused me
of ripping 'em off,

30:39.338 --> 30:40.404
and making 'em disappear.

30:40.406 --> 30:42.039
But it was crap.
And they never found

30:42.041 --> 30:44.041
no bodies or any of the stuff
that went missing.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.175
(chains rattling)

30:45.177 --> 30:47.077
Yeah, till now.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.979
STEVE: Yeah, one of the things
that went missing

30:48.981 --> 30:50.914
was an ivory chess set.

30:50.916 --> 30:52.616
And that right there
is one of the pieces.

30:52.618 --> 30:54.451
(muffled crying)

30:54.453 --> 30:56.220
Somebody!

30:56.222 --> 30:57.855
(pounding)
Help!

30:57.857 --> 30:59.056
I'm in here!

30:59.058 --> 31:00.324
Danny!

31:12.171 --> 31:13.570
(woman screams)

31:13.572 --> 31:15.572
You okay?

31:15.574 --> 31:16.573
Okay, hey.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.008
(inhales sharply)
Hey.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.376
You're safe, okay?
You're safe.

31:19.378 --> 31:20.510
I'm with Five-O.
Everything's gonna be all right.

31:20.512 --> 31:21.578
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

31:22.915 --> 31:26.083
(grunting)

31:29.521 --> 31:31.121
(grunting)
Ah!

31:34.126 --> 31:36.260
Guys!
Shaw's on the move.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.961
Copy.

31:38.664 --> 31:39.930
(tires screeching)
I got him!

31:39.932 --> 31:41.064
Lou, see if you can
cut him off.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.266
(engine revs)

31:43.202 --> 31:45.302
(grunting)

31:47.206 --> 31:49.306
Chin, go around.
Got it!

31:51.210 --> 31:53.010
(panting)

31:56.916 --> 31:58.415

32:39.525 --> 32:41.191
Chin, head him off!

Duke, we have a suspect
in the Pua Lei.

36:03.629 --> 36:05.495
We need a perimeter set.
Bring everyone you got.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.531
(sirens approaching)

36:07.533 --> 36:09.599
Five-O. We need
to seal the hotel.

36:09.601 --> 36:10.901
No one gets in or out.

36:10.903 --> 36:12.602
Excuse me?
Did you hear the man?

36:12.604 --> 36:14.171
Pick up the phone
and call security right now.

36:14.173 --> 36:17.574
Gentlemen, I have
1,500 guests in this hotel.

36:17.576 --> 36:18.909
What do I tell them?

36:18.911 --> 36:20.443
You tell them if
they want to enjoy

36:20.445 --> 36:21.545
the rest of
their vacation,

36:21.547 --> 36:22.846
they go back to
their hotel rooms,

36:22.848 --> 36:24.247
lock their doors
and stay inside

36:24.249 --> 36:25.315
until we say it's safe
to come back out.

36:38.263 --> 36:39.880
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Attention all guests.

36:39.881 --> 36:41.498
On orders from HPD,
please remain in your rooms

36:41.500 --> 36:44.968
with the doors locked
until further notice.

36:44.970 --> 36:47.437
What's happening is
almost unimaginable.

36:47.439 --> 36:49.639
A suspected serial killer
connected to the murders

36:49.641 --> 36:52.342
of 14 people,
including half a dozen tourists,

36:52.344 --> 36:54.578
is loose inside a popular hotel

36:54.580 --> 36:56.279
with 1,500 guests
trapped inside.

36:56.281 --> 36:57.781
Hey. How's the girl?

36:57.783 --> 36:59.482
Locked in a room
for five days.

36:59.484 --> 37:00.717
How do you think she is?

37:00.719 --> 37:01.851
Listen, you should go
to the hospital

37:01.853 --> 37:03.520
and get that looked
at properly, okay?

37:03.522 --> 37:04.788
I'm fine.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.356
You're fine?
That's good.

37:06.358 --> 37:07.757
I'm gonna put that
on your tombstone.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.209
"He said he was fine.
He was wrong."

37:09.210 --> 37:10.660
What's the matter with you?
Do me a favor.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.696
Give us a second, would you?

37:12.698 --> 37:14.231
What's the matter?

37:15.000 --> 37:16.766
I love you.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.219
I love you, too.

37:19.220 --> 37:20.703
Okay, then, give me a break.
Would you give me a break?

37:20.706 --> 37:22.239
You want a break?
All right, I'll step aside,

37:22.241 --> 37:23.457
watch where you
get yourself killed.

37:23.458 --> 37:24.674
Is that what you want?
Not trying to get myself killed.

37:24.676 --> 37:25.675
No? Are you sure?
No.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.110
Because it's a relief.

37:27.111 --> 37:28.544
Because it seems like,
for the last five, six years,

37:28.547 --> 37:29.913
that's... that's
been the goal.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.280
Again, I think you're being
a little overdramatic.

37:31.283 --> 37:33.850
Okay. You know what?
Forget about it.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.552
Good luck. Good luck!
Hey, hey, wait.

37:35.554 --> 37:36.886
Wait. Wait.
Wait for what?

37:36.888 --> 37:38.922
Danny... What do you want? What?

37:42.527 --> 37:44.628
Thank you.

37:45.631 --> 37:46.863
You're welcome.

37:46.865 --> 37:49.532
All right, building's secure.
We're going in.

37:49.534 --> 37:50.700
All right, where's my vest?

37:50.702 --> 37:52.269
What do you mean
where's your vest?

37:52.271 --> 37:53.570
Where you going?

37:53.572 --> 37:55.538
Where am I going?
I'm going across the street

37:55.540 --> 37:56.873
for a cappuccino...
Where am I going?

37:56.875 --> 37:58.408
Where do you think?

37:58.410 --> 38:00.193
What about the talk
we just had?

38:00.194 --> 38:01.977
It was a very nice talk,
and I meant everything I said.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.713
I didn't say I was
gonna stand down.

38:05.484 --> 38:06.616
You're an idiot.
I'm done.

38:06.618 --> 38:07.651
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second.

38:07.653 --> 38:09.119
Before you strap
up, listen.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.586
We got more more than
enough guys in here.

38:10.587 --> 38:12.053
These guys are right. You know what?
Save your breath,

38:12.057 --> 38:14.758
'cause he's determined
to have my noble sacrifice

38:14.760 --> 38:16.326
be in vain.
Don't give me that look.

38:16.328 --> 38:17.627
That's good.
You know what?

38:17.629 --> 38:19.362
If you need
anybody else's organs,

38:19.364 --> 38:20.897
talk to Chin,
'cause I'm done.

38:20.899 --> 38:23.533
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

38:24.736 --> 38:27.470
GROVER: Detective Dunn,
good to see you.

38:27.472 --> 38:28.605
Thought you guys
could use a hand.

38:28.607 --> 38:29.839
Yeah.

38:40.786 --> 38:42.485
KONO (over radio):
All right, guys,

38:42.487 --> 38:43.887
I have eyes on every floor.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.831
LUKELA:<i> My guys have been</i>
<i> checking the elevators.</i>

38:54.833 --> 38:57.867
They say a service car is not
responding to the call button.

39:00.806 --> 39:02.339
KONO:
It's empty.

39:02.341 --> 39:04.341
What was the last
floor it was on?

39:04.343 --> 39:06.009
17th floor.

39:06.011 --> 39:09.546
Chin, check the service
elevator on the 17th floor.

39:16.655 --> 39:18.955
(grunting)

39:22.994 --> 39:24.060
I got him two flights up.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.802
(hinges squeaks)

39:32.804 --> 39:35.472
Hey!

39:44.916 --> 39:47.417
(helicopter approaching)

39:51.857 --> 39:53.923
Hey!

39:56.528 --> 39:57.961
Eh, here we go again.

40:10.142 --> 40:11.541
Steve! Don't do it!

40:16.748 --> 40:19.149
(screaming)

40:22.854 --> 40:24.587
(thud)

40:31.129 --> 40:32.796
Didn't see that coming.

40:35.967 --> 40:39.102
♪ ♪

41:04.996 --> 41:06.863
Well, I don't know
about you guys,

41:06.865 --> 41:08.198
but I could sure use a beer.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.833
Oh, we're in.
Definitely.

41:09.835 --> 41:11.134
Yeah, I'm in, too.
How about you two?

41:11.136 --> 41:12.735
No, we can't drink.
We can't drink.

41:12.737 --> 41:14.938
Yeah, doctor's orders.
A couple months, can't drink.

41:14.940 --> 41:17.874
Makes sense. You each
only have half a liver.

41:17.876 --> 41:19.476
How about we get you
some wings from Side Street?

41:19.478 --> 41:20.577
That sounds good.

41:20.579 --> 41:22.011
Tell you what,
you guys have at it.

41:22.013 --> 41:25.748
I'm gonna, uh...
I'm gonna head home.

41:25.750 --> 41:26.850
Eh, I've broken
pretty much

41:26.852 --> 41:28.785
every post-op rule
there is to break.

41:28.787 --> 41:29.853
I think I'm
gonna go rest up

41:29.855 --> 41:31.120
a little bit, you know?

41:31.122 --> 41:32.989
Might even take
a couple days off.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.724
GROVER: What?
(Abby chuckles)

41:41.933 --> 41:43.533
You two.
(laughter)

42:03.922 --> 42:05.989
(quiet thump)

42:27.779 --> 42:28.845
(loud bang)
