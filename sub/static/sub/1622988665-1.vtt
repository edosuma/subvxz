01:27.997 --> 01:30.536
Aria.

01:35.004 --> 01:36.971
Help!

01:37.006 --> 01:38.775
Help!

03:43.165 --> 03:45.638
Help! Help!

03:47.103 --> 03:48.674
Help me!

03:48.709 --> 03:51.941
Help!

03:51.976 --> 03:56.044
Help! Help!

03:56.079 --> 03:58.013
Help!

04:16.099 --> 04:19.704
Emergency
evacuation activated.

05:02.981 --> 05:05.586
System error.

05:11.154 --> 05:13.891
System error.

07:02.397 --> 07:05.200
Level 52.

07:58.992 --> 08:03.797
Ca... Can anyone hear me?
Can anyone hear me?

08:03.832 --> 08:05.161
Hello!

08:05.196 --> 08:07.801
Hello?

08:07.836 --> 08:11.739
Hello? Someone get me
out of here!

08:13.875 --> 08:16.810
Hello? Hello?

08:19.177 --> 08:20.781
Hello?

08:24.919 --> 08:26.919
Hello?

09:32.052 --> 09:33.920
Oh, thank God.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.771
I'm calling her
one more time.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.432
No, Barbara!

09:51.467 --> 09:53.302
Aria, where are you?
Why aren't you picking up?

09:53.337 --> 09:54.842
Barbara, come on!

09:54.877 --> 09:56.239
Why isn't she
picking up?

09:56.274 --> 09:58.076
- Hurry!
- Oh, there she is!

09:58.111 --> 10:00.441
- There she is!
- What's wrong?

10:00.476 --> 10:03.851
Move, move!
Get in. Get in!

10:03.886 --> 10:06.051
Hey, hey, watch out!

10:06.086 --> 10:08.284
Stay down!

10:08.319 --> 10:09.923
Dad!

10:09.958 --> 10:11.485
Stay down both of you!

10:11.520 --> 10:13.289
Richard, what's going on?

10:13.324 --> 10:15.060
Dr Thompson,
they found us.

10:15.095 --> 10:17.557
- Mom?
- Aria, just keep down.

10:17.592 --> 10:19.900
Lie across the seat.
Richard, watch...

10:19.935 --> 10:21.869
Watch the road!

10:21.904 --> 10:23.871
We knew this day
would come, Richard.

10:23.906 --> 10:26.335
Tell Zara we love her.
If Aria makes it out of this...

10:26.370 --> 10:29.404
I'll look out
for her. Goodbye, my friend.

10:29.439 --> 10:32.110
Mom, what's going on?
Dad?!

10:34.048 --> 10:35.883
- Who are you calling now?
- Jack.

10:35.918 --> 10:37.544
Hide your phones.
Do it!

10:37.579 --> 10:39.216
- But why?
- Do it!

10:40.615 --> 10:43.385
Richard.
This is my personal line.

10:43.420 --> 10:45.057
It's not encrypted.

10:45.092 --> 10:46.487
We've been
compromised.

10:46.522 --> 10:48.291
- What?
- How did they find me?

10:48.326 --> 10:50.557
I need to make
some calls. Is Aria with...

10:50.592 --> 10:52.394
What if they know
the truth, Jack?

10:52.429 --> 10:54.330
Dad, the van, watch out!

11:04.243 --> 11:07.541
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

11:09.314 --> 11:12.887
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

11:16.585 --> 11:18.453
System error.

11:21.194 --> 11:23.997
System error.

11:48.254 --> 11:49.484
OK.

12:03.104 --> 12:04.972
OK.

12:05.007 --> 12:06.633
911,
what is your emergency?

12:06.668 --> 12:08.976
You have to help me!
I'm trapped in an elevator.

12:09.011 --> 12:11.374
Help me, please!

12:11.409 --> 12:13.145
- Ma'am...
- Please help me!

12:13.180 --> 12:15.048
..can you tell me
where you're calling from?

12:15.083 --> 12:16.951
- Shanghai!
- I'm losing you.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.579
Hello?

12:18.614 --> 12:20.020
Hello?

12:22.453 --> 12:24.387
No!

12:30.428 --> 12:33.627
Can anyone see me?
Can anyone see me?

12:33.662 --> 12:36.234
Hello? Hello?

12:57.587 --> 12:59.290
Oh, my God!

12:59.325 --> 13:01.556
Oh, my God!

13:03.329 --> 13:05.428
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

13:06.958 --> 13:08.958
Hello, what is your emergency?

13:10.105 --> 13:13.238
Hello?

13:13.273 --> 13:15.339
Do you speak English?

13:18.146 --> 13:21.378
Hel... Hello? No, wait!
Goddammit!

13:21.413 --> 13:23.710
Hello, this is Emergency.
How can I help you?

13:23.745 --> 13:26.515
I'm trapped in an elevator.
Please help me.

13:26.550 --> 13:28.649
- Get me out of here, please.
- Please, I'm sorry,

13:28.684 --> 13:31.487
could you speak
a little more slowly for me?

13:31.522 --> 13:35.062
I'm trapped. Kidnapped.

13:39.299 --> 13:41.761
Oh, my God, get me out of here.

13:41.796 --> 13:43.466
Where... where... where
are you?

13:43.501 --> 13:46.601
I'm in your elevator.
It's going to fall.

13:46.636 --> 13:48.702
You need to send somebody.
Hurry!

13:48.737 --> 13:51.441
- What is your name?
- Aria Wolf.

13:51.476 --> 13:53.146
And which building
are you in?

13:53.181 --> 13:54.774
Shouldn't you know this
on your system?

13:54.809 --> 13:56.611
Oh, you are
in our elevator?

13:56.646 --> 13:58.217
Yes!

13:58.252 --> 13:59.746
OK, just wait one moment,
please.

13:59.781 --> 14:02.287
no! no, no, wait!

14:08.592 --> 14:11.296
Hello, Aria.

14:11.331 --> 14:15.135
All our elevators are wired
into our system.

14:15.170 --> 14:17.071
Your location is not appearing.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.732
- What?
- Wait one moment.

14:18.767 --> 14:22.769
♪ Deck
the halls with boughs of holly

14:22.804 --> 14:24.342
♪ Fa, la, la, la, la... ♪

14:26.115 --> 14:28.478

14:41.130 --> 14:43.625
They're
different from other children.

14:48.830 --> 14:52.337
Don't let
Dad tell them it was me, Aria.

14:52.372 --> 14:54.834
The world
is dying.

14:54.869 --> 14:56.473
We need to stop.

14:56.508 --> 14:59.410
We can't stop.
We're here for a reason.

14:59.445 --> 15:00.642
I just sense something.

15:00.677 --> 15:02.281
Aria can see things.

15:02.316 --> 15:05.119
Bad things that don't care
about anything.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.188
They won't be stopped.
We must stop them.

15:08.223 --> 15:11.323
Wake up. What do you see
in your nightmares?

15:11.358 --> 15:14.326
- Wake up. They need to die.
- Death.

15:14.361 --> 15:16.394
Aria. Wake up.

15:16.429 --> 15:18.858
Wake up. Remember.

15:28.441 --> 15:30.771
This will help
you control your nightmares...

15:30.806 --> 15:32.377
..experiment.

15:32.412 --> 15:35.281
You'll lose your memory.
You'll lose your memory.

15:50.661 --> 15:52.397
Help!

16:39.578 --> 16:41.347
System error.

16:43.945 --> 16:46.451
System error.

16:48.389 --> 16:50.158
System error.

16:51.854 --> 16:54.723
Going down.

17:08.343 --> 17:10.871
We should tell them
who we really are.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.906
It's getting stronger.

17:12.941 --> 17:17.515
I'm starting to understand more
day by day.

17:17.550 --> 17:18.944
I see things.

17:18.980 --> 17:21.519
What things?

17:21.554 --> 17:23.257
You, Zara.

17:24.656 --> 17:26.523
Shhh.

17:26.559 --> 17:29.494
There's something
different about our children.

17:29.529 --> 17:33.267
They never get sick, those
odd marks on their wrists.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.400
What's that about?

17:36.437 --> 17:38.239
Unless I'm losing my mind,

17:38.274 --> 17:40.604
those trees weren't there
this morning.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.807
There's some connection
to Nature.

17:47.008 --> 17:50.416
The plants, they responded
to them like...

17:51.419 --> 17:53.254
..like they were
talking to them.

17:53.289 --> 17:56.290
They're connected to the Earth.

17:57.018 --> 17:58.556
What are you saying?

17:58.591 --> 18:01.658
They're some kind of
Mother Nature?

18:03.728 --> 18:05.860
What if they are?

18:21.845 --> 18:23.482
Aria.

19:05.955 --> 19:07.922
- Aria?
- Mom.

19:07.957 --> 19:09.561
Aria, thank God
you're alive.

19:09.596 --> 19:12.091
Listen to me.
I don't have much time.

19:12.126 --> 19:15.930
You need to hide your phone.
No matter what, don't lose it.

19:15.965 --> 19:17.767
- Mom!
- Don't let anyone find it.

19:17.802 --> 19:19.934
They've taken me.

19:19.969 --> 19:22.574
None of this is going to
make any sense to you right now, OK?

19:22.609 --> 19:25.940
We tried. We tried to avoid it.
It didn't work.

19:25.975 --> 19:28.943
What do I do?
Who are these people?

19:28.978 --> 19:31.385
You warned us
this could happen.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.080
Don't ever blame yourself, OK?

19:34.115 --> 19:36.390
You have a twin sister, Zara.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.853
If you live, find her.

19:37.888 --> 19:40.119
You need to be strong,
you hear me?

19:40.154 --> 19:41.387
Mom?

19:41.422 --> 19:43.529
Your dad left a voicemail.

19:43.564 --> 19:45.366
No!

19:45.401 --> 19:47.093
Mom?

19:52.441 --> 19:55.640
- No, no, no!
- No. No, no, no.

19:55.675 --> 19:57.807
No! Mom!

19:57.842 --> 19:59.380
Get down!

20:03.749 --> 20:06.585
Mom! Mom! Mom!

20:06.620 --> 20:07.850
- Mom!
- Nina?

20:07.885 --> 20:09.984
- Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!
- It's OK.

20:10.019 --> 20:13.053
Oh, oh, baby.
Oh, baby, you're shaking.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.791
She has nightmares.

20:14.826 --> 20:18.091
Oh, baby, it's OK.
They're only nightmares.

20:18.126 --> 20:20.093
You... You're gonna be OK.

20:20.128 --> 20:22.964
But it's the same nightmare.

20:22.999 --> 20:26.935
- Oh? What is it about, Nina?
- You.

20:26.970 --> 20:28.805
Shut up, Zara! It's your fault!

20:28.840 --> 20:32.446
Nina, Nina. I know that I've
not been around much lately

20:32.481 --> 20:36.516
but we'll be together soon, OK?
OK?

20:36.551 --> 20:38.683
Just lie down, baby.

20:40.181 --> 20:42.753
I need to go to work.
Are you OK?

20:42.788 --> 20:45.492
It's OK. It's OK, darling.

20:47.826 --> 20:50.497
I got it.

20:50.532 --> 20:52.158
Bye.

20:58.067 --> 20:59.803
Hey.

21:01.543 --> 21:06.810
I hear ice-cream is the only
cure for nightmares.

21:06.845 --> 21:10.209
- Do I get some?
- Did you have a nightmare?

21:10.244 --> 21:12.046
No.

21:18.252 --> 21:20.692
What's going on
with you and Zara?

21:22.630 --> 21:24.498
Hmm?

21:33.036 --> 21:34.838
You know, um...

21:37.645 --> 21:40.646
..if you need to
tell me anything

21:40.681 --> 21:42.747
no matter how strange.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.181
She's watching us.

21:48.216 --> 21:50.788
Who's watching us?

21:52.957 --> 21:55.628
Zara?

21:55.663 --> 21:57.663
My older self.

21:58.864 --> 22:00.468
Aria.

22:01.603 --> 22:04.230
She's trying to understand.

22:39.135 --> 22:40.904
Aria.

22:40.939 --> 22:42.301
It's Jack.

22:42.336 --> 22:43.973
Your voice...

22:44.008 --> 22:46.239
It's a bad line.
I'm in Afghanistan.

22:46.274 --> 22:48.582
I can't get through
to your dad.

22:48.617 --> 22:51.783
You have to help us.
You have to help us.

22:51.818 --> 22:55.952
Please. We've been taken.
They killed Mom.

22:55.987 --> 22:57.921
Here's what
you should do.

23:01.223 --> 23:02.563
Hello?

23:02.598 --> 23:04.026
..what you should do.

23:04.061 --> 23:07.029
Hello?

23:08.802 --> 23:10.736
Here is what
I need you to do.

23:15.336 --> 23:18.238
Come on.

23:30.384 --> 23:32.923
Where is
the Engineer?

24:14.098 --> 24:15.801
Dad?

24:15.836 --> 24:18.133
Aria?

24:18.168 --> 24:19.706
- Aria!
- Dad!

24:19.741 --> 24:22.236
You alright? You motherfu-

24:22.271 --> 24:25.844
- Get him
up, get him up!

24:25.879 --> 24:28.946
I thought you'd recognise
my voice.

24:28.981 --> 24:33.786
You're a hard man to find
but you are getting rusty.

24:33.821 --> 24:35.953
I'm getting old.

24:35.988 --> 24:39.022
And look at you, a father.

24:39.057 --> 24:42.091
And what a beautiful daughter
you have, huh?

24:42.126 --> 24:45.094
How did that happen?

24:45.129 --> 24:49.164
Something very familiar
about this situation.

24:49.199 --> 24:51.397
Can you guess what?

24:53.467 --> 24:55.401
You have no idea
what you're dealing with!

24:55.436 --> 24:57.403
Hold him up! Hold him up.

25:00.144 --> 25:03.717
You've got to be the dumbest,
most out of luck...

25:05.446 --> 25:07.248
Look at her!

25:07.283 --> 25:14.255
All alone, nowhere to go
except straight down.

25:14.290 --> 25:16.796
Bit by bit.

25:16.831 --> 25:19.194
Watch her suffer!

25:19.229 --> 25:25.233
Watch her suffer
like my men suffered!

25:28.238 --> 25:33.076
Let her see the monster
that you really are.

25:39.018 --> 25:41.018
Hello.

25:41.053 --> 25:46.485
Nina Aria Davis.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.861
I bet you didn't know that.

25:51.998 --> 25:53.998
Aria Wolf.

25:54.033 --> 25:56.363
I don't usually
introduce myself this way

25:56.398 --> 26:00.741
but sometimes you gotta roll
with it.

26:00.776 --> 26:02.204
Look up.

26:02.239 --> 26:06.340
Look up, look up at the CCTV.

26:06.375 --> 26:08.408
There you are!

26:10.000 --> 26:10.958
Drop the elevator.

26:12.821 --> 26:14.755
Don't do it! Don't!

26:16.022 --> 26:17.054
Aria!

26:47.581 --> 26:48.987
Dad.

26:54.357 --> 26:55.928
Is that
what these marks are?

27:07.876 --> 27:11.405
And the trees?
That was you guys?

27:16.445 --> 27:19.050
That was Zara.

27:19.085 --> 27:20.447
Do you think I'm a freak?

27:22.385 --> 27:24.957
No. Never.

27:28.028 --> 27:30.160
It's just a lot to take in.

27:35.497 --> 27:37.068
There's something else.

27:39.303 --> 27:41.270
I can see the future.

27:45.243 --> 27:46.814
What do you see?

27:56.892 --> 27:58.859
Going up.

28:17.176 --> 28:20.111
No, no, no.

28:20.146 --> 28:22.014
No, no.

28:45.237 --> 28:47.171
Do you hate me?

28:48.438 --> 28:50.944
No! Never!

29:20.107 --> 29:22.041
We got cut off. Aria?

29:22.076 --> 29:25.077
Uncle Jack! We've been taken.
We've been taken.

29:25.112 --> 29:26.210
They've got Dad.

29:26.245 --> 29:27.343
Who are they?

29:27.378 --> 29:30.379
Some men. I don't know.

29:30.414 --> 29:31.677
Aria...

29:31.712 --> 29:33.580
You have to help us.

29:33.615 --> 29:37.155
I will. Now listen.
I need details.

29:37.190 --> 29:38.717
What happened?

29:38.752 --> 29:41.159
You're wasting time,
you have to...

29:41.194 --> 29:42.721
- Aria...
- ..call the embassy

29:42.756 --> 29:45.064
or someone
who can actually help.

29:45.099 --> 29:48.100
Aria, stop! The more you
tell me the more I can help.

29:48.135 --> 29:50.168
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

29:51.270 --> 29:53.402
We've been in China
for a holiday.

29:53.437 --> 29:56.405
We were at the airport,
we were coming back home.

29:56.440 --> 29:58.308
All of a sudden,

29:58.343 --> 30:01.146
Dad just started acting
all weird, in a panic.

30:01.181 --> 30:03.478
He just... He just ran
towards me

30:03.513 --> 30:07.152
and he said, "They've found us,
they've found us."

30:07.187 --> 30:10.584
He stole a cab and we got in.

30:10.619 --> 30:13.554
They were chasing us,
they were shooting at us.

30:13.589 --> 30:15.655
And then we crashed.

30:15.690 --> 30:19.593
And I woke up here and I was
blindfolded and tied up.

30:21.102 --> 30:24.037
- Shanghai?
- Mm-hm. Yes.

30:24.072 --> 30:27.172
Somewhere.
I'm trapped in an elevator.

30:27.207 --> 30:29.438
- An elevator?
- You've gotta help me.

30:29.473 --> 30:31.275
You're sure Dad
is still alive?

30:31.310 --> 30:34.773
I can see him on a screen.
They're beating him so bad.

30:34.808 --> 30:37.776
This is hard, I know.
Focus on my voice.

30:37.811 --> 30:42.187
Is there an older man, Russian,
glasses, with them?

30:42.222 --> 30:43.683
What do they want with us?

30:43.718 --> 30:46.389
They want your dad.

30:46.424 --> 30:50.459
- Your dad is CIA.
- What?

30:50.494 --> 30:52.626
You've been
in witness protection

30:52.661 --> 30:54.595
since you were seven.

30:54.630 --> 30:57.730
I think it's safe to say
I'm not your real uncle.

31:01.208 --> 31:03.406
I've been protecting you
and your family

31:03.441 --> 31:05.804
for over 12 years now.

31:05.839 --> 31:10.116
The man who has your father
is Yaroslav Krupnov.

31:10.151 --> 31:11.447
He's after what your dad knows.

31:11.482 --> 31:13.317
What does he know?
What does he know?

31:13.352 --> 31:14.615
That's classified, Aria.

31:14.650 --> 31:17.222
Why doesn't he just tell them?

31:17.257 --> 31:20.654
He's hoping I might find
you so we don't have a lot of time.

31:20.689 --> 31:22.590
Can they see you now?

31:22.625 --> 31:24.559
I'm under...
I'm under the CCTV.

31:24.594 --> 31:27.100
- Hear you?
- There's a red light.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.794
I think it's switched off
right now.

31:28.829 --> 31:31.467
- Keep your phone hidden.
- They are going to come back.

31:31.502 --> 31:33.271
This is our only chance
of finding you.

31:33.306 --> 31:35.207
They are going to come back.

31:35.242 --> 31:37.341
If they see you have it
they'll kill him. Understand?

31:39.180 --> 31:41.246
Uncle Jack?

31:44.317 --> 31:46.449
Level 76.

31:52.457 --> 31:54.721
You know, I could
kill for a cheeseburger.

31:57.264 --> 32:01.266
Hey, two cheeseburgers
and Coke.

32:05.206 --> 32:06.799
Where's the Engineer?

32:06.834 --> 32:09.670
You tell me,
I'll be good to you.

32:09.705 --> 32:12.178
Get you some food, alright?

32:12.213 --> 32:15.412
Get your daughter some food.

32:15.447 --> 32:16.875
You're never going to find him.

32:16.910 --> 32:21.583
You know how this works,
Richard.

32:21.618 --> 32:24.190
Bit by bit, huh?

32:24.225 --> 32:28.326
Keep watching.

32:30.528 --> 32:32.462
Take your clothes off.

32:34.235 --> 32:35.366
What?

32:35.401 --> 32:37.731
- Dad?
- Take your clothes off!

32:37.766 --> 32:39.535
Don't!

32:39.570 --> 32:41.636
Press it.

32:41.671 --> 32:44.276
No, no!

33:11.404 --> 33:13.338
Take your clothes off.

33:16.673 --> 33:18.607
Do it.

33:19.676 --> 33:21.181
Do it!

33:27.651 --> 33:30.256
- Press it.
- Go to hell.

33:32.986 --> 33:34.722
Drop it!

33:41.792 --> 33:42.792
Did I not warn you all?

33:47.704 --> 33:50.276
Richard, Richard, Richard.

33:50.311 --> 33:54.214
You are my American James Bond.

33:57.714 --> 33:59.582
We're running out of time.

33:59.617 --> 34:02.915
- What do you want?
- Remove your masks.

34:02.950 --> 34:05.885
Ah, Richard, old boy.

34:05.920 --> 34:08.920
You know what they will do
to her if I wasn't here?

34:08.956 --> 34:13.761
What kind of father
does this to his child?

34:13.795 --> 34:16.599
You tell me, huh?

34:27.579 --> 34:33.978
You see, Anton here, his father
was in that elevator in Paris.

34:35.587 --> 34:39.886
They called it poetic justice.

34:42.396 --> 34:44.627
Captain Cologne?

34:44.661 --> 34:47.333
His dad was a dick.

34:47.368 --> 34:50.335
Please stop hurting him.
Please let us go.

34:50.371 --> 34:52.569
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi.

34:52.603 --> 34:55.539
Please let you go?

35:02.680 --> 35:06.682
I was hoping
for five fingers.

35:06.717 --> 35:09.047
What happened?

35:09.082 --> 35:10.719
I lost 'em.

35:10.754 --> 35:11.951
"I lost 'em."

35:11.986 --> 35:14.822
Richard, you are my favourite.

35:14.857 --> 35:18.056
Aria, here's a little story
for you.

35:18.091 --> 35:20.366
I know it's a little
before your time

35:20.401 --> 35:22.467
but what the hell?

35:22.502 --> 35:28.572
In 1945, a B-25 bomber
had crashed

35:28.607 --> 35:31.377
into the great
Empire State Building.

35:31.412 --> 35:33.643
Its engines sliced through it

35:33.678 --> 35:36.976
like a warm knife
through butter

35:37.011 --> 35:41.684
and eventually it got stopped
by the elevator shaft.

35:41.719 --> 35:44.654
The cables of two elevators
were severed,

35:44.689 --> 35:50.528
including one containing
a 19-year-old operator,

35:50.563 --> 35:53.058
Betty Lou Oliver.

35:53.093 --> 35:57.700
The elevator plummeted
75 floors...

35:57.735 --> 36:00.505
Boom!

36:00.540 --> 36:03.640
..and crashed into
the sub-basement.

36:03.675 --> 36:06.511
But luckily for Betty,

36:06.546 --> 36:11.912
about 1,000 feet
of the severed elevator cable

36:11.947 --> 36:16.983
coiled at the bottom
and cushioned the blow.

36:17.018 --> 36:20.657
Betty broke her back

36:20.692 --> 36:21.658
and her neck...

36:23.057 --> 36:25.728
..but survived.

36:25.763 --> 36:27.565
Aria, look away.

36:32.066 --> 36:36.607
This building is
20 storeys taller

36:36.642 --> 36:41.579
than the Empire State Building
and there are no cables.

36:50.920 --> 36:53.558
You're a pawn.

36:53.593 --> 36:56.594
Pawns get taken first.

36:56.629 --> 36:59.729
You are an innocent daughter
caught in the middle of it

36:59.764 --> 37:02.930
but your father is
a very bad man.

37:02.965 --> 37:06.505
He's assassinated
a lot of people.

37:06.540 --> 37:08.166
My people.

37:08.201 --> 37:11.070
And now he is doing this
to you.

37:11.105 --> 37:13.545
He has no love in his heart.

37:13.580 --> 37:15.008
Uh-uh.

37:15.043 --> 37:17.780
He enjoys seeing you suffer.

37:17.815 --> 37:19.716
No, you've got
the wrong family.

37:19.751 --> 37:22.521
I like her.
She's trying.

37:24.591 --> 37:26.492
Don't listen to him, honey.

37:27.220 --> 37:29.627
This doesn't hurt.

37:29.662 --> 37:32.124
Keep looking away.

37:32.159 --> 37:38.097
Level 85. That's ten floors
higher than Betty.

37:38.132 --> 37:40.572
I need you to do me a favor.

37:40.607 --> 37:44.939
You see, your daddy
is hiding someone from us,

37:44.974 --> 37:48.173
someone who does not
belong to him.

37:48.208 --> 37:49.944
We want him.

37:49.979 --> 37:52.078
You're never gonna find him.

37:59.593 --> 38:01.153
I'll never talk.

38:01.188 --> 38:03.463
Oh, yes.

38:03.498 --> 38:04.761
You will.

38:26.246 --> 38:28.554
Our birthmarks are
becoming different.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.154
Why do you think it's me?

38:36.190 --> 38:37.596
I would never do that.

38:38.830 --> 38:40.225
You do.

38:40.260 --> 38:42.535
I don't know when yet.

38:42.570 --> 38:45.802
Promise me. Walk away
no matter what he does.

38:46.838 --> 38:49.575
I promise.

38:49.610 --> 38:52.006
We need to stop doing
what we're born to do.

38:52.041 --> 38:54.074
We can't hide who we are.

38:54.109 --> 38:56.714
We might have to. For them.

38:56.749 --> 38:58.617
How?

39:01.050 --> 39:04.117
Mom and Dad's lives
depend on it.

39:09.190 --> 39:10.893
Aria.

40:28.973 --> 40:30.302
No, no, no, no, no.

40:30.337 --> 40:32.205
Come on!

42:21.888 --> 42:24.724
Aria, guess where I am?

42:26.992 --> 42:28.728
So, I'm at the beach.

42:28.763 --> 42:31.764
Do you see why I need you?
I'm actually a mess.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.359
I mean, look,

42:33.394 --> 42:35.064
I know you're probably having
the best time in China

42:35.099 --> 42:36.802
but the beach, girl!

42:36.837 --> 42:39.805
Like, come on!
And I really miss you.

42:39.840 --> 42:41.466
So can you come back soon?

42:41.501 --> 42:44.436
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

43:00.894 --> 43:04.929
♪ Happy birthday to you

43:04.964 --> 43:09.032
♪ Happy birthday to you

43:09.067 --> 43:15.368
♪ Happy birthday
dear Aria... ♪

43:15.403 --> 43:19.438
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

43:19.473 --> 43:22.144
- Hip, hip...
- Hooray!

44:49.937 --> 44:52.872
- What have you done?
- Why did you stop me?

44:52.907 --> 44:53.972
You killed him!

44:54.007 --> 44:55.941
He was beating that dog!

44:55.976 --> 44:59.043
- I warned you.
- Humans are disgusting.

44:59.078 --> 45:01.309
Can't you see that?

45:01.344 --> 45:05.610
They're cruel. They pollute.
They destroy.

45:05.645 --> 45:08.954
Everything you do has
consequences.

45:08.989 --> 45:12.551
Wake up, Nina!
He deserved to die.

45:12.586 --> 45:14.927
They'll come for us.

45:14.962 --> 45:16.555
You killed Mom and Dad.

45:16.590 --> 45:19.228
You can't control the future,
Nina.

45:19.263 --> 45:21.065
You can't control me.

45:21.100 --> 45:23.001
We're not the same.

45:23.036 --> 45:24.904
I'm not you.

45:29.537 --> 45:32.142
Do you even care about them?

45:35.708 --> 45:37.609
You have to go.

45:37.644 --> 45:39.677
Forever.

45:39.712 --> 45:41.514
No.

45:44.288 --> 45:47.223
Don't tell them it was me.

45:49.392 --> 45:51.898
What are YOU gonna do?

45:55.464 --> 45:59.103
I'm going to try and change
their future.

46:07.509 --> 46:09.575
Thank God.

46:18.388 --> 46:20.388
Did you do it?

46:21.490 --> 46:23.160
Did you do it, kiddo?

46:23.195 --> 46:26.262
You can tell me, OK?
I won't be mad.

46:26.297 --> 46:28.165
I did it.

47:11.078 --> 47:13.639
Aria Wolf!

47:13.674 --> 47:16.312
Speak.

47:16.347 --> 47:18.116
This is bigger than all of us.

47:23.189 --> 47:28.555
Your poor wife.
Chopped up. Decapitated.

47:31.296 --> 47:32.493
For what?

47:32.528 --> 47:36.167
Some engineer? Some girl?

47:37.137 --> 47:39.038
Watch this.

47:40.767 --> 47:42.371
Hang on tight.

47:43.638 --> 47:45.242
Going down!

47:50.777 --> 47:53.580
Death. You.

47:53.615 --> 47:55.747
You're death.

47:58.521 --> 48:01.093
You kill millions of people.

48:06.199 --> 48:08.628
But you're much older.

48:08.663 --> 48:12.302
You blame everyone
for what they do to Earth.

48:51.574 --> 48:53.640
Aria.

48:53.675 --> 48:57.512
We have men in Shanghai
but we can't find you.

48:57.547 --> 49:01.846
I don't know how much
I can take.

49:03.421 --> 49:06.224
Is there a 3G or 4G
on your phone?

49:11.264 --> 49:13.198
No.

49:13.233 --> 49:14.562
OK, we're gonna need
to pinpoint your location.

49:14.597 --> 49:16.894
What did my father do
for the CIA?

49:16.929 --> 49:19.798
Our prime objective
is to get you out.

49:19.833 --> 49:21.206
This can wait.

49:21.241 --> 49:22.768
Tell me.

49:24.376 --> 49:28.312
He was a field agent
assigned to high-risk cases,

49:28.347 --> 49:30.182
mostly top secret.

49:30.217 --> 49:31.843
He murdered people?!

49:31.878 --> 49:33.581
Do you think you're
helping him right now?

49:33.616 --> 49:36.848
He breaks, you're both dead.
Time is running out.

49:36.883 --> 49:39.686
The more accurate
the information you provide,

49:39.721 --> 49:41.391
the faster my men find you.

49:41.426 --> 49:43.360
What can you see?

49:45.298 --> 49:48.563
- Aria?
- Nothing.

49:48.598 --> 49:51.401
It's under construction,
I think.

49:51.436 --> 49:54.206
It must be nearly finished.
It's modern.

49:54.241 --> 49:55.834
There's a new
building development...

49:55.869 --> 49:57.341
What?

49:57.376 --> 49:58.771
..outskirts of the city,
eight of them.

49:58.806 --> 50:00.542
This could be where you are.

50:00.577 --> 50:02.874
Does Dad look like
he's gonna break?

50:02.909 --> 50:06.185
Does it look like he's gonna
give them what they want?

50:06.220 --> 50:08.550
What type of torture
are they using?

50:08.585 --> 50:09.848
They beat him.

50:09.883 --> 50:13.654
They... electrocute him.

50:13.689 --> 50:16.195
They pulled out
his fingernails.

50:18.991 --> 50:21.233
Be strong for him, Aria.

50:25.536 --> 50:29.208
But he's... But he's all alone.

50:29.243 --> 50:31.738
And he's all I've got.

50:31.773 --> 50:33.476
You've got to get him
out of there,

50:33.511 --> 50:35.313
you've got to help him.

50:35.348 --> 50:38.943
Before Dad called me
he made an encrypted call.

50:38.978 --> 50:41.286
Do you know who he spoke with?

50:45.886 --> 50:47.655
How do you know that?

50:47.690 --> 50:49.261
Who did he call?

50:49.296 --> 50:51.857
Can you recall
what they spoke about?

50:54.301 --> 50:56.862
He called some doctor.

50:56.897 --> 50:58.732
Oh, yeah, good,
that's good.

50:58.767 --> 51:01.273
Now, what did Dad say to him?

51:02.408 --> 51:04.309
I think he just said goodbye
to him.

51:04.344 --> 51:06.476
- Was there someone else?
- No.

51:06.511 --> 51:08.478
Was there anything
unusual about the call?

51:08.513 --> 51:10.348
No, there wasn't.

51:10.383 --> 51:11.778
Did your father ever
mention an engineer to you?

51:11.813 --> 51:13.846
Or a man
and a little blonde girl

51:13.881 --> 51:15.485
your dad accompanied to Paris?

51:15.520 --> 51:17.388
Why are you asking me
all this?

51:17.423 --> 51:20.622
Did your mom ever speak
about a doctor, Dr Thompson?

51:20.657 --> 51:22.888
Did you ever see your dad meet
anyone at home

51:22.923 --> 51:25.660
you felt was unusual?
Think, Aria.

51:25.695 --> 51:28.025
- Mention an experiment?
- No.

51:28.060 --> 51:31.699
A child? An engineer?
Come on, think.

51:33.472 --> 51:35.901
We're just a normal family.

51:40.578 --> 51:43.348
Can you get us out of here
or not?

51:44.714 --> 51:46.945
Get us the data signal.

51:48.421 --> 51:51.521
All we need is 15 seconds.

51:54.856 --> 51:56.526
Can you do that?

51:58.332 --> 52:00.332
- I know how to get it.
- That's good.

52:00.367 --> 52:02.664
We'll be watching for it.

52:24.457 --> 52:26.556
Miss Wolf?

52:28.527 --> 52:31.693
Ready for
another ride?

52:32.927 --> 52:35.499
Dad, tell them.

52:35.534 --> 52:38.766
Richard, why don't
you listen to your daughter,

52:38.801 --> 52:40.735
make a deal?

52:40.770 --> 52:43.639
Look what you're doing to her!

52:46.578 --> 52:49.942
Why such a sad face?

52:49.977 --> 52:51.977
It's not that bad.

52:54.421 --> 52:57.389
She'll never see you
the same way.

52:57.424 --> 53:01.360
Did you see her face? Her eyes?

53:01.395 --> 53:03.593
Betrayed.

53:03.628 --> 53:05.859
Oh, my beloved daddy.

53:05.894 --> 53:07.058
A liar.

53:07.093 --> 53:09.632
A killer.

53:09.667 --> 53:11.128
Your own little daughter.

53:11.163 --> 53:14.604
Your own flesh and blood.

53:14.639 --> 53:16.034
Look what you put her through.

53:16.069 --> 53:17.706
Why?

53:17.741 --> 53:19.609
To save a traitor.

53:19.644 --> 53:21.380
Give me his location.

53:21.415 --> 53:25.648
Give me his location!
Ease her suffering.

53:29.786 --> 53:31.456
Dad.

53:34.560 --> 53:39.057
Seems like your silence is
more important than your life

53:39.092 --> 53:40.993
or your mother's.

53:42.062 --> 53:44.733
You disappoint me, Richard.

53:44.768 --> 53:47.131
You're a failed father.

53:48.541 --> 53:51.036
The next drop will be a big one.

53:51.071 --> 53:53.676
Pray he talks.

54:02.555 --> 54:04.423
Aria?

54:15.766 --> 54:17.898
Aria.

54:17.933 --> 54:19.163
I'm here.

54:19.198 --> 54:22.100
That's him.
That's Yaroslav.

54:22.135 --> 54:24.443
He and your dad
have a long history.

54:24.478 --> 54:26.808
He's a former FSB operative,

54:26.843 --> 54:29.481
now a hired gun
for big corporations.

54:29.516 --> 54:32.209
A complete nut job, bipolar.

54:32.244 --> 54:35.520
So don't get caught up
in his mind games.

54:38.085 --> 54:41.086
If they get what they want
it's over.

54:43.090 --> 54:45.563
Do you understand?

54:45.598 --> 54:47.466
If they get
the Engineer's location,

54:47.501 --> 54:49.567
everything your dad has spent
his life protecting

54:49.602 --> 54:51.162
will be for nothing.

54:51.197 --> 54:53.703
Who is this engineer?

54:53.738 --> 54:55.067
I've said too much.

54:55.102 --> 54:57.168
Should I ask Yaroslav?

54:57.203 --> 54:58.906
Jack, tell me.

55:02.978 --> 55:04.483
Jack?

55:04.518 --> 55:06.210
Your dad was transporting
a child

55:06.245 --> 55:09.983
with extraordinary abilities.

55:10.018 --> 55:13.690
A girl with a power
beyond anything

55:13.725 --> 55:15.186
we could possibly imagine.

55:15.221 --> 55:17.056
A girl.

55:17.091 --> 55:19.795
Officially and likely
a more plausible explanation,

55:19.830 --> 55:23.667
he was helping her father,
a chemical engineer,

55:23.702 --> 55:27.099
who found a way to advance
the human condition.

55:27.134 --> 55:30.542
He was referred to as
the Engineer.

55:30.577 --> 55:33.842
Your dad was helping them to
resettle somewhere in Europe.

55:33.877 --> 55:35.844
Russian intelligence
learned of it

55:35.879 --> 55:39.144
and sent Yaroslav and his crew
to Paris.

55:39.179 --> 55:40.684
Something happened.

55:40.719 --> 55:42.180
It's unclear exactly what

55:42.215 --> 55:44.985
but Yaroslav woke up
in the hospital

55:45.020 --> 55:46.855
and his men were all dead,

55:46.890 --> 55:50.628
found in a busted-up elevator
at the bottom of a shaft.

55:50.663 --> 55:53.565
The Engineer and his child
vanished,

55:53.600 --> 55:55.094
never seen again.

55:55.129 --> 55:57.635
Only Dad knows where they are.

56:02.004 --> 56:03.773
Low battery.

56:03.808 --> 56:05.907
Shit!

56:07.779 --> 56:09.141
Level 95.

56:18.152 --> 56:19.184
Anton.

56:23.542 --> 56:24.792
Why is that elevator moving?

56:31.208 --> 56:32.417
Go and sort it out.

57:26.352 --> 57:29.122
Level 95.

57:41.675 --> 57:42.338
Hey, hey!

57:42.375 --> 57:43.583
This place is
a restricted area.

57:45.208 --> 57:46.625
What are you doing
inside of here?

57:52.884 --> 57:54.180
No.

57:54.215 --> 57:55.984
No, no. No, no.

57:56.019 --> 57:57.414
You need to go.

57:57.449 --> 57:59.922
You need to get out of here.
It's not safe!

57:59.957 --> 58:00.989
Go!

58:01.024 --> 58:02.320
Hey! Get out of here!

58:02.625 --> 58:03.656
What are you doing
inside of here?

58:03.697 --> 58:06.027
Go! No, get out of here!

58:06.062 --> 58:07.897
No. No, no, no!

58:07.932 --> 58:10.295
No! No, go, go!

58:10.330 --> 58:11.901
Go. Go now!

58:21.440 --> 58:24.881
No escape for you.

58:30.383 --> 58:31.855
Again!

58:35.157 --> 58:36.992
Again!

58:39.898 --> 58:41.997
- Again!
- No!

58:44.034 --> 58:47.464
Naive. Stupid.

58:47.499 --> 58:49.301
Do you think this is a game?

58:49.336 --> 58:53.041
Just give me his location.

59:12.029 --> 59:17.263
Your daughter
is a piece of work.

59:17.298 --> 59:20.266
You taught her well.

59:24.625 --> 59:25.667
30 minutes.

59:28.208 --> 59:29.417
Start packing up.

59:42.323 --> 59:43.388
Did you get a signal?

59:44.792 --> 59:46.000
Check him again.

59:56.370 --> 59:57.402
Are you dead?

59:58.625 --> 01:00:00.000
You checked her, right?

01:00:06.182 --> 01:00:08.413
OK. Is this on?

01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:25.771
They heard you calling me.

01:00:27.973 --> 01:00:30.204
- Did you get my signal?
- No.

01:00:32.307 --> 01:00:34.142
We're down to four buildings.

01:00:34.177 --> 01:00:37.013
Don't give up.
We will find you.

01:00:37.048 --> 01:00:38.784
Low battery.

01:01:16.219 --> 01:01:19.418
Level 86.

01:01:28.132 --> 01:01:29.901
Oh, God.

01:05:18.758 --> 01:05:21.363
- Aria.
- Jack.

01:05:22.795 --> 01:05:25.367
Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:05:26.865 --> 01:05:29.338
I think I've found a way out.

01:05:31.210 --> 01:05:34.640
There's a panel. It's loose.

01:05:34.675 --> 01:05:38.512
There are beams
going down and across and...

01:05:39.911 --> 01:05:41.614
..I think I can make it.

01:05:41.649 --> 01:05:44.353
I think I can get out
and I can get help.

01:05:44.388 --> 01:05:46.784
It's too late for that.

01:05:46.819 --> 01:05:48.720
You being there
is keeping him alive.

01:05:48.755 --> 01:05:50.590
What do you mean?

01:05:50.625 --> 01:05:52.394
You want me to sit here
and do nothing?

01:05:53.727 --> 01:05:55.265
You can't abandon him,

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:57.564
not when we're this close
to finding you.

01:05:57.599 --> 01:05:59.170
I can't sit here.

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:00.897
If you leave,
they'll extract him.

01:06:00.932 --> 01:06:02.800
We'll never find him.

01:06:02.835 --> 01:06:04.307
No.

01:06:04.342 --> 01:06:06.210
Don't abandon him.

01:06:06.245 --> 01:06:07.607
We need you there.

01:06:07.642 --> 01:06:09.675
So you need to ask yourself...

01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:13.184
..can you live with all that?

01:06:15.419 --> 01:06:18.156
We're down to three buildings
now, Aria.

01:06:18.191 --> 01:06:19.553
Don't give up.

01:06:19.588 --> 01:06:21.621
We will find you.

01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:24.558
OK.

01:07:08.934 --> 01:07:12.573
God.

01:07:24.015 --> 01:07:27.588
You have to find her.
Stop her.

01:07:36.830 --> 01:07:39.435
Aria.

01:07:41.901 --> 01:07:44.869
We're nothing alike.

01:07:44.904 --> 01:07:46.772
You destroyed our family.

01:07:46.807 --> 01:07:49.445
You can't stop me.

01:07:50.844 --> 01:07:53.746
You can't change the future.

01:07:57.851 --> 01:08:00.390
I'll be in Paris
with Dad.

01:08:07.927 --> 01:08:09.894
What if you fail?

01:08:09.929 --> 01:08:11.900
I'll never forgive you.

01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:17.638
You did this.

01:08:17.673 --> 01:08:20.575
The world needs to change.

01:08:27.814 --> 01:08:30.255
Where is
the Engineer?

01:08:37.495 --> 01:08:39.462
- You shoot like shit.
- Dad!

01:08:39.497 --> 01:08:43.026
Oh, really?
Next one, you'll be dead.

01:08:43.962 --> 01:08:45.666
Drag him out.

01:08:57.613 --> 01:08:59.581
No.

01:12:44.577 --> 01:12:46.170
System error.

01:12:48.042 --> 01:12:50.042
- System error.
- No!

01:12:51.782 --> 01:12:53.144
System error.

01:12:55.313 --> 01:12:56.917
System error.

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:00.822
System error.

01:13:02.595 --> 01:13:04.254
System error.

01:13:06.357 --> 01:13:08.159
System error.

01:13:54.273 --> 01:13:59.210
WHO are you
talking to?

01:14:01.082 --> 01:14:03.280
CIA?

01:14:10.375 --> 01:14:11.792
We should go.

01:14:13.208 --> 01:14:14.208
Bring him here.

01:14:27.779 --> 01:14:28.976
No! Dad!

01:14:31.112 --> 01:14:32.947
No.

01:14:32.982 --> 01:14:37.215
You choose now who dies first.

01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:40.053
You or him.

01:14:40.088 --> 01:14:43.628
Why the charade?
Why not just shoot me?

01:14:47.128 --> 01:14:51.394
She's so like you.

01:14:51.429 --> 01:14:54.738
But I'm afraid
we're out of time.

01:14:54.773 --> 01:14:56.707
You just killed your father.

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:58.742
They're not even coming!
They can't find us!

01:14:58.777 --> 01:15:00.975
Don't hurt him! Stop!

01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:20.324
Call that CIA and get me
the Engineer's location.

01:15:20.359 --> 01:15:22.733
You've got five minutes.

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:24.768
FIVE MINUTES!

01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:34.041
Going up.

01:15:46.319 --> 01:15:48.891
Aria.

01:15:48.926 --> 01:15:51.289
Jack, they know
I've been talking to you.

01:15:51.324 --> 01:15:53.324
We've got your signal.

01:15:55.328 --> 01:15:57.427
- What?
- Building 8. We've got you.

01:15:57.462 --> 01:16:00.034
Entering the ground floor.

01:16:00.069 --> 01:16:02.366
Well... Well, what if
they see you coming?

01:16:02.401 --> 01:16:03.367
Trust me. They won't.

01:16:03.402 --> 01:16:05.303
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
What do I tell them?

01:16:05.338 --> 01:16:06.571
I've got to tell them something.

01:16:06.606 --> 01:16:10.473
Get your dad on his own.
Say you need to talk to him.

01:16:10.508 --> 01:16:14.015
That maybe you can help them.
You have to stall.

01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:17.887
There's no way. He won't talk.

01:16:17.922 --> 01:16:19.185
If this operation fails,

01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:20.857
we could also lose the Engineer.

01:16:20.892 --> 01:16:22.958
We can't take that chance, Aria.

01:16:22.993 --> 01:16:25.257
You have to try, find a way.

01:16:25.292 --> 01:16:27.028
This wasn't easy.

01:16:27.063 --> 01:16:29.261
I moved heaven and earth
to make this operation happen.

01:16:29.296 --> 01:16:33.463
I know
it's hard to trust anyone.

01:16:33.498 --> 01:16:35.773
But we're out of time.

01:16:35.808 --> 01:16:38.369
Your life depends upon it.

01:16:39.438 --> 01:16:41.405
I'll be on the line.

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.506
I'm not leaving you.

01:16:46.852 --> 01:16:48.082
You're his little girl.

01:16:48.117 --> 01:16:50.018
He loves you.

01:16:54.024 --> 01:16:56.189
You have the Engineer?

01:17:00.833 --> 01:17:02.459
I will... Please don't...

01:17:02.494 --> 01:17:04.164
They don't know where he is.

01:17:04.199 --> 01:17:07.365
My father is the only person
who knows.

01:17:08.434 --> 01:17:10.874
Just wait. Wait, wait, wait.

01:17:11.943 --> 01:17:15.208
Just let me talk to him. Alone!

01:17:15.243 --> 01:17:17.881
If he's going to talk
to anyone, he'll talk to me.

01:17:17.916 --> 01:17:20.345
You mean nothing to them.

01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:22.182
You know this, don't you?

01:17:22.217 --> 01:17:25.416
Your own people
can't even protect you.

01:17:26.584 --> 01:17:29.552
How do I know
that you don't call them

01:17:29.587 --> 01:17:30.927
and tell them first?

01:17:30.962 --> 01:17:33.226
You promise me you'll let us go.

01:17:33.261 --> 01:17:35.261
That's the trade.

01:17:35.296 --> 01:17:36.460
Sure.

01:17:36.495 --> 01:17:39.804
You have... three minutes!

01:17:50.509 --> 01:17:52.245
Dad.

01:17:56.449 --> 01:17:58.988
Dad.

01:18:05.326 --> 01:18:07.029
Dad.

01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:10.098
Dad.

01:18:11.398 --> 01:18:13.596
It's me. Can you hear me?

01:18:23.014 --> 01:18:24.343
Little Bee.

01:18:29.614 --> 01:18:31.548
I had no choice.

01:18:41.626 --> 01:18:43.934
I'm sorry.

01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:58.080
The first day I held you

01:18:58.115 --> 01:19:02.447
was the most incredible day
of my life.

01:19:07.289 --> 01:19:09.993
I thought I could have
prevented...

01:19:11.964 --> 01:19:14.162
Kept you all safe.

01:19:21.303 --> 01:19:25.503
Dad... I know.

01:19:25.538 --> 01:19:29.078
We need to fix this, OK?

01:19:29.113 --> 01:19:32.510
I need you to tell me
where he is.

01:19:38.254 --> 01:19:40.320
He doesn't exist.

01:19:44.557 --> 01:19:46.458
It's a hoax.

01:19:51.267 --> 01:19:52.937
What?

01:19:55.106 --> 01:19:57.205
There's no engineer.

01:19:59.770 --> 01:20:03.475
I created him to protect you.

01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:06.049
You told us this would happen.

01:20:08.449 --> 01:20:11.087
Wait, wait, wait. Me?

01:20:11.122 --> 01:20:13.584
You're not making any sense.

01:20:16.556 --> 01:20:21.328
I've kept everything you can do
hidden,

01:20:21.363 --> 01:20:25.563
hoping to prevent them
from finding you.

01:20:25.598 --> 01:20:29.270
After the experiment,
when you lost your memory

01:20:29.305 --> 01:20:34.341
I didn't know what to do
for us to survive.

01:20:34.376 --> 01:20:35.738
What am I?

01:20:37.115 --> 01:20:39.478
Some kind of freak?

01:20:39.513 --> 01:20:42.151
No. No.

01:20:44.650 --> 01:20:48.553
Everything you need to know
is in you...

01:20:49.688 --> 01:20:53.129
..waiting to get out.

01:20:53.164 --> 01:20:57.463
The experiment locked it away.

01:20:57.498 --> 01:21:02.039
You tried to save us,
to give us a fighting chance.

01:21:02.074 --> 01:21:03.700
Where is Zara?

01:21:05.275 --> 01:21:07.143
She's alive.

01:21:08.377 --> 01:21:10.377
Safe.

01:21:10.412 --> 01:21:13.017
When you killed that man, I...

01:21:14.218 --> 01:21:16.482
I remember.

01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:20.585
She made me promise.

01:21:22.589 --> 01:21:25.062
Promise what?

01:21:25.097 --> 01:21:28.626
I tried to stop her when
she tried to kill that man.

01:21:33.204 --> 01:21:37.404
But Dad, Dad, I need you
to help me.

01:21:37.439 --> 01:21:39.538
OK? I need to give them
something.

01:21:39.573 --> 01:21:42.376
I need to give them something,
anything.

01:21:42.411 --> 01:21:44.840
I lied...

01:21:44.875 --> 01:21:47.480
..to everybody.

01:21:47.515 --> 01:21:49.482
Aria.

01:21:54.885 --> 01:21:58.359
- Jack.
- Jack?

01:21:58.394 --> 01:21:59.789
Where did you get your phone?

01:21:59.824 --> 01:22:03.331
They wouldn't have let you.

01:22:07.139 --> 01:22:12.406
Don't I feel the fool
chasing a ghost

01:22:12.441 --> 01:22:14.309
all this time.

01:22:14.344 --> 01:22:19.380
Twins with unstoppable power.

01:22:19.415 --> 01:22:23.219
Why separate you both?

01:22:23.254 --> 01:22:27.256
But why?
Why go through all this?

01:22:34.298 --> 01:22:37.266
You can't change
the future.

01:22:37.301 --> 01:22:39.631
- You can't change the future.
- Listen to me!

01:22:40.865 --> 01:22:43.140
There's a...

01:22:43.175 --> 01:22:44.702
..voice memo.

01:22:44.737 --> 01:22:48.178
It's encrypted... on your phone.

01:22:48.873 --> 01:22:50.543
- Play it.
- What?

01:22:50.578 --> 01:22:52.743
- Play it now!
- What?

01:22:52.778 --> 01:22:55.251
There's no time, just do it!

01:22:55.286 --> 01:22:57.418
Press the damn memo!

01:22:57.453 --> 01:22:59.585
I can't protect you any longer.

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:02.192
Voice recognition
required.

01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:03.919
Aria Wolf.

01:23:03.954 --> 01:23:05.888
Voice accepted.

01:23:46.898 --> 01:23:50.570
What is happening to me?
What's happening to me?

01:23:52.871 --> 01:23:54.871
Dad, what is this?

01:24:07.523 --> 01:24:10.986
This future's just
a possibility.

01:24:11.021 --> 01:24:15.727
Once we've done this it's
important you never tell me.

01:24:17.533 --> 01:24:19.698
How will we know it worked?

01:24:21.471 --> 01:24:25.605
There'll be no elevator.
No torture.

01:24:26.707 --> 01:24:28.509
Mom will still be alive.

01:24:31.811 --> 01:24:34.746
It's not every day
you learn you're gonna die.

01:24:36.453 --> 01:24:38.651
That's why we must do this.

01:24:38.686 --> 01:24:42.325
It's the only chance
we may have to survive.

01:24:44.956 --> 01:24:46.956
Can she see us?

01:24:48.729 --> 01:24:50.960
Yes. She's listening right now.

01:24:52.568 --> 01:24:55.404
- Am I with her?
- Yes.

01:25:03.975 --> 01:25:07.383
Our times are now aligned.

01:25:07.418 --> 01:25:08.780
There's no more time.

01:25:17.692 --> 01:25:21.595
Aria. I'm sorry I couldn't
protect you.

01:25:23.335 --> 01:25:24.532
It's time, Dad.

01:25:27.735 --> 01:25:29.999
I love you, my little Bee.

01:25:31.607 --> 01:25:33.541
I love you, Dad.

01:25:41.012 --> 01:25:43.320
I'm sorry.

01:26:41.809 --> 01:26:43.512
Stop!

01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:52.752
This is the hard bit, kiddo.

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:06.634
- I see things.
- What things?

01:27:08.066 --> 01:27:11.408
Death.

01:28:24.978 --> 01:28:29.211
Level 120.

01:28:54.304 --> 01:28:56.678
System override.

01:28:59.542 --> 01:29:01.417
Bring her to me.

01:29:11.833 --> 01:29:13.375
How did she do that?

01:29:20.770 --> 01:29:23.672
There's something
different about our children.

01:29:29.878 --> 01:29:31.240
What are you saying?

01:29:31.275 --> 01:29:33.616
They're some kind of
Mother Nature?

01:29:33.651 --> 01:29:35.849
What if they are?

01:29:53.231 --> 01:29:55.803
We will
always love you.

01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:00.577
Don't forget who you are.

01:30:03.648 --> 01:30:05.681
Remember.

01:31:16.833 --> 01:31:17.833
Let's go!

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.958
Nothing can be done.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.333
Is the mother still alive?

01:31:38.375 --> 01:31:40.917
It's somehow related
to his children.

01:32:14.306 --> 01:32:15.338
Going down.

01:32:26.792 --> 01:32:27.958
That's impossible!

01:32:38.583 --> 01:32:40.792
I need a new team.

01:33:00.187 --> 01:33:01.923
Dad!

01:33:16.401 --> 01:33:18.368
I'm sorry.

01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:25.243
I've failed.

01:33:26.345 --> 01:33:27.949
Aria.

01:33:30.052 --> 01:33:32.789
It's you, you...

01:33:34.122 --> 01:33:36.221
..life.

01:33:36.256 --> 01:33:40.390
You... are... life.

01:33:48.532 --> 01:33:51.500
Don't be afraid.

01:34:00.379 --> 01:34:06.548
Some... things... you...
just can't change.

01:34:20.872 --> 01:34:24.874
Find... your... sister.

01:34:38.648 --> 01:34:42.056
You're... stronger...

01:34:44.126 --> 01:34:46.027
..together.

01:35:00.307 --> 01:35:05.310
Help... us be better.

01:35:13.683 --> 01:35:16.288
Love...

01:35:18.193 --> 01:35:19.929
..you.
