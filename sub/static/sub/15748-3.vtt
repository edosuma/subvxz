00:00.210 --> 00:02.550
Firstly, let's deal with
the surplus women.

00:02.600 --> 00:06.270
- We've all been changed by the war.
- I don't work for Selfridge's any more.

00:06.320 --> 00:08.510
I'll come to you when
I'm ready, Violette.

00:08.560 --> 00:11.150
A huge hotel bill for her.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.550
- I'm his wife now.
- Maybe there are some things he can't share.

00:14.600 --> 00:17.390
- What's he talking to Victor about?
- He's had enough.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.510
I know a man looking for
oblivion when I see one.

00:19.560 --> 00:22.830
- Where does that leave us?
- Changed, I fear, Mr. Selfridge.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.510
I got my book deal. What it's
like for our soldiers now.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.950
The field goes to auction
and I'm going to bid.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.230
- To build houses for heroes.
- Nothing in that for you.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.310
- On the contrary.
- Loxley?

00:33.360 --> 00:36.100
- You know him?
- Stay away from him.

01:05.519 --> 01:07.870
Welcome to the Roof Garden.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.630
Selfridge's is launching our
biggest beauty event ever

01:10.680 --> 01:16.270
and, to celebrate, we have 50 very
generous gift vouchers ready to fly.

01:16.320 --> 01:21.310
- Luxury treats on us in skincare, perfume...
- And cosmetics.

01:21.360 --> 01:25.120
Mrs. Edwards, the head of Beauty.
You do the honors, please.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.390
This beauty event is very
important for Selfridge's.

01:37.440 --> 01:40.590
- What's the application demonstration?
- Color cosmetics.

01:40.640 --> 01:43.990
I've worked with renowned
cosmepologists from Paris and America.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.870
I'll be giving our customers
some expert advice.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.510
- Congratulations.
- Oh.

01:49.560 --> 01:52.630
Head of Accessories. I
gather it's official now?

01:52.680 --> 01:55.150
- Really?
- And Miss Mardle's running Fashion.

01:55.200 --> 01:58.630
- And Miss Calthorpe has proved
herself more than capable.
- Oh...

01:58.680 --> 02:01.110
You must be our youngest
head of department.

02:01.160 --> 02:04.240
- You'll get the hang of it in no time.
- Thanks.

02:05.200 --> 02:09.400
There are days when I wish I had a nice,
small department like Accessories.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.870
- Seriously, Grace, that's great news.
- Oh, I wasn't sure I was good enough.

02:18.920 --> 02:22.640
- Course you are. Anyone says any
different, you send them to me.
- Ooh.

02:24.480 --> 02:28.910
- We should go out and celebrate.
- Oh, if you say so... Mr. Selfridge.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.710
On busy days, it's like
Piccadilly Circus in here.

02:35.760 --> 02:39.110
Women need to see the clothes so here
we have models showing garments,

02:39.160 --> 02:42.790
like the Lanvin collection, while
the customers sit and watch.

02:42.840 --> 02:45.830
- You've surpassed yourself.
- Just a few changes.

02:45.880 --> 02:48.960
No, really. Selfridge's wasn't
the same without you.

02:51.560 --> 02:55.670
Now, I have a favor to ask.
Tomorrow is my wife's birthday.

02:55.720 --> 02:58.630
I'd like to do something
special for her.

02:58.680 --> 03:01.910
Could Doris come in, pick
out a few new dresses?

03:01.960 --> 03:03.790
Yes, of course, Mr. Grove.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.200
Thank you, Miss Mardle.

03:09.080 --> 03:13.870
- So, this loan will be for a housing estate?
- That's right.

03:13.920 --> 03:19.350
- That won't make any profit?
- Well, it'll be homes for
ex-servicemen and their families.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.310
Â£30,000.

03:21.360 --> 03:25.670
- That's a lot of money for
a personal loan, even for you.
- That's why you're here.

03:25.720 --> 03:29.190
A lot of money for a man
with very few assets.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.190
Your townhouse is leased.

03:32.240 --> 03:37.920
- Mm. I own the largest store in London.
- You own 51% as a shareholder.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.030
I just wondered if
he'd said anything...

03:43.080 --> 03:45.430
since the board meeting?

03:45.480 --> 03:48.190
Not to me.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.190
Things are...

03:50.240 --> 03:52.190
uncomfortable.

03:52.240 --> 03:55.320
You did the right thing, Arthur.
I know it wasn't easy.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.280
And nor is this.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.830
We let the women go today.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.550
The chief won't like that either.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.830
- You can have your loan, Mr. Selfridge.
- Thank you.

04:09.880 --> 04:15.190
- But with so few assets, the bank will
insist on a higher rate of interest.
- Mm.

04:15.240 --> 04:18.240
- How high?
- Around 15%.

04:26.160 --> 04:29.480
- Cigarette, sir?
- Yes.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.950
Spare any change for a soldier?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.350
Makes you count your
blessings, don't it?

04:36.400 --> 04:40.200
Some of us come back without
so much as a scratch.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.760
Yes. We were lucky.

04:47.760 --> 04:51.520
- Thanks, guv.
- We're in the wrong game.

04:53.720 --> 04:58.310
- The bank manager? Nobody told me.
- Mr. Selfridge's personal
bank manager, Mr. Crabb.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.830
Nothing concerning the store.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.960
- We'll be in touch.
- Mm.

05:06.080 --> 05:11.630
- Mr. Grove, Mr. Crabb.
- Chief, the surplus female
staff, it's their last day.

05:11.680 --> 05:15.030
- I haven't forgotten.
- Shall I ask them to assemble
in the loading bay?

05:15.080 --> 05:18.640
Have them come to my office. A personal
farewell is the least we owe them.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.790
We need to agree who's doing
what for this beauty event.

05:26.840 --> 05:30.800
There's the window, something for the
Palm Court and all of the displays.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.710
- Henri?
- I heard you.

05:36.760 --> 05:39.120
That's a relief (!)

05:41.800 --> 05:44.200
I'm sorry. It's just that...

05:45.400 --> 05:48.230
- Well, it's been like this for weeks now.
- Like what?

05:48.280 --> 05:50.630
Me talking to myself.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.040
You not talking at all.

05:54.600 --> 05:59.070
Look, I just want to help, if
you'll tell me what's wrong.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.480
There's nothing wrong.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.990
When you starting working
with us in the loading bay,

06:11.040 --> 06:14.470
we thought it would only be for a
few months. It's been four years.

06:14.520 --> 06:17.270
I wanted to say thank you.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.990
You'll get references, of course.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.910
Sorry. It's just...

06:25.960 --> 06:30.160
references won't mean nothing out there.
There's hundreds of women looking for jobs.

06:31.160 --> 06:35.060
- And a month's wages in hand.
- And when they run out?

06:37.680 --> 06:41.920
- I loved it here and I
was good at what I did.
- Yes, you were.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.640
Miss Hawkins.

07:22.280 --> 07:27.310
Well, Myra says there's jobs in the East
End, if you can use a sewing machine.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.510
I want a job doing what I'm
good at, lifting and driving.

07:30.560 --> 07:33.560
- But that's all men now.
- You want a job?

07:36.640 --> 07:39.390
- What's wrong with that?
- Four years we was out in France.

07:39.440 --> 07:43.190
Now look at us. Left selling
fags on the street.

07:43.240 --> 07:47.390
Why don't you go home? Stick to what you're
good at. Keeping house and having kids.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.790
Yeah, and other things.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.190
And what are you good at?

07:51.240 --> 07:54.030
Come 'ere and I'll show you.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.680
- Oh, leave 'em, Connie.
- That's right, run along.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.640
- You're pathetic.
- Ooh.

08:07.560 --> 08:12.310
- Well, that's it. They're all gone.
- Mr. Crabb says a month's
pay is very generous.

08:12.360 --> 08:15.920
Well, your mom would say, 'Have
you done all you could to help?'

08:17.000 --> 08:21.150
This housing estate. THAT
will help, won't it?

08:21.200 --> 08:28.070
- I mean, not the women who've gone today
but... other women, families in need.
- Mm.

08:28.120 --> 08:30.990
Your mother might say that too.

08:31.040 --> 08:35.150
Listen, Gordon, I appreciate you stood
up for me at that board meeting.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.429
Sometimes maybe I'm
a little hard on you.

08:37.480 --> 08:39.549
It meant a lot to me.

08:42.200 --> 08:45.390
Mr. Selfridge, your car is outside.
The auction's at six.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.740
Come on. Let's show 'em
what we're made of.

08:49.240 --> 08:54.750
Who do they think they are? Harassing
innocent women like that.

08:54.800 --> 08:58.350
- There are lots of ex-servicemen out of work.
- Peas are for everyone, Connie.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.430
So, you're saying they were right?

09:00.480 --> 09:02.630
No, just jobs are thin on the ground.

09:02.680 --> 09:05.710
- Don't I know it.
- Well, what are you going to do?

09:05.760 --> 09:08.500
You can't sit around here all day.

09:10.680 --> 09:14.400
I could help keep house...
while you're out.

09:16.680 --> 09:19.040
You need another job.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.910
Isn't there anything at Selfridge's?
What about your beauty event?

09:24.960 --> 09:26.790
You could put a word in.

09:26.840 --> 09:30.110
Pull strings. You're always
saying how important you are.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.390
- Could we leave this-
- I worked my way up the
ladder to get where I am.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.990
Nobody did me any favors.
You want work, Connie?

09:37.040 --> 09:40.440
You get up off your behind
and you start looking.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.120
Lovely chops.

09:56.320 --> 10:01.070
Lot 43. An opportunity to purchase
undeveloped land in Acton, west London.

10:01.120 --> 10:06.750
Ten acres of prime arable land just
five miles from the center of London.

10:06.800 --> 10:12.190
Easily accessible from the Uxbridge Road
with transport links to the west and south.

10:12.240 --> 10:15.470
With multiple access points
and a lake at the heart of it,

10:15.520 --> 10:20.190
it's an attractive proposition for housing
developers or commercial property.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.430
Offered for sale freehold.

10:22.480 --> 10:26.510
(It shouldn't go for more than
14,000. 15 at the most.)

10:26.560 --> 10:30.030
- (That's my limit.)
- Bids are invited to start at Â£10,000.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.430
Â£10,000 anyone?

10:32.480 --> 10:34.830
10,200?

10:34.880 --> 10:37.240
10,400?

10:38.600 --> 10:40.960
10,600?

10:41.880 --> 10:44.240
10,800?

10:46.040 --> 10:49.040
(They'll all be out
by 14. You watch.)

10:49.520 --> 10:51.880
11,000?

10:58.040 --> 11:03.360
Gentlemen, we have Â£14,000.
Who'll give me 14,200?

11:05.920 --> 11:08.280
14,400?

11:11.240 --> 11:15.920
- I told you.
- Any advance? 14,200?

11:18.520 --> 11:20.880
15,000.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.960
15,000 from Lord Loxley,
a new bidder.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.440
15,200?

11:30.360 --> 11:32.030
Mr. Selfridge?

11:34.800 --> 11:37.160
16,000.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.990
Pa, you said 15 was your limit.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.400
16,500?

11:43.280 --> 11:45.430
17.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.840
17,500?

11:50.240 --> 11:52.350
20,000.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.070
- Â£20,000.
- Pa, what are you doing?

11:55.680 --> 11:58.040
Lord Loxley?

12:03.680 --> 12:05.600
25.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.400
27,000.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.400
Do we have a sale?

12:17.960 --> 12:20.320
28.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.760
Mr. Selfridge?

12:28.240 --> 12:31.390
(Your mom would have
wanted this to happen.)

12:31.440 --> 12:33.950
30,000.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.350
Â£30,000.

12:36.400 --> 12:40.320
Gentlemen, are there any
more bids? Lord Loxley?

12:44.560 --> 12:49.150
For the first time,
for the second time...

12:49.200 --> 12:51.150
Third and final time.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.560
Sold.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.270
Loxley.

13:13.320 --> 13:16.480
- I heard you were back.
- Did you miss me?

13:17.640 --> 13:20.110
- Why were you bidding?
- It's a public auction.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.670
- You didn't want that land.
- And you don't know when to stop.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.950
In business, Selfridge, never
let your heart rule your head.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.390
Stay away from me, Loxley,
me and my family.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.380
Why so unfriendly?

13:33.800 --> 13:36.160
You got what you wanted.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.960
And so will I.

13:52.440 --> 13:56.870
- Pa, where have you been? We're meant
to be having a family dinner. I told you.
- Where's Serge?

13:56.920 --> 13:58.550
- Getting dressed.
- Serge!

13:58.600 --> 14:00.230
- Pa?
- What's the matter?

14:00.280 --> 14:03.510
We went to an auction for the
land. Lord Loxley was there.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.920
What's all the shouting?

14:08.200 --> 14:11.510
- Did you tell Lord Loxley
about the housing project?
- Why?

14:11.560 --> 14:14.510
Because he just bid against
me, pushing the price up.

14:14.560 --> 14:18.150
- Maybe we've discussed business affairs.
- You've what?

14:18.200 --> 14:24.150
- Loxley's interested in my passenger plane.
- I told you to have nothing
to do with Loxley.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.630
- And I told you it was none of your business.
- Serge!

14:26.680 --> 14:31.230
You're married to my daughter, you live
under my roof. That makes it my business.

14:31.280 --> 14:35.150
- Then why don't you back me?
- I'm sure this is all a misunderstanding.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.990
- Loxley is using you to get at me.
- He believes in me.

14:39.040 --> 14:43.710
- He is trying to undermine me and my family.
- You're doing a pretty
good job of that yourself.

14:43.760 --> 14:46.990
Serge!

14:50.080 --> 14:51.710
- Serge, come with me.
- But I am in the -

14:51.760 --> 14:53.350
I think you've said enough.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.520
Serge!

15:04.760 --> 15:08.800
- I will not be made a fool of.
- I understand but you must calm down.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.560
I'll talk to Rosalie.

15:19.400 --> 15:22.900
We should do these family
dinners more often!

15:34.640 --> 15:38.950
- You're busy.
- Oh, yes. Doing my homework.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.510
Is Henri back?

15:41.560 --> 15:43.910
No. I thought you were out together.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.310
I needed a walk.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.550
Well, it's... It's not late.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.540
- He could be home any minute now.
- Yes.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.240
- Good night.
- Good night, Agnes.

16:32.680 --> 16:35.710
- I have to say, it's a relief
to be at work today.
- Hm.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.110
Good morning, Miss Plunkett.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.510
Can you sent a card to Miss Webb?

16:40.560 --> 16:43.470
Just say, 'I won the field.'

16:43.520 --> 16:45.880
She'll understand.

17:09.119 --> 17:10.460
Agnes?

17:12.720 --> 17:15.079
I need to talk to you.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.600
I heard you got married.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.630
Congratulations.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.040
Thank you.

17:38.480 --> 17:42.480
- Henri's one of my regulars now.
- That's why I'm here.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.840
Erm... he isn't himself.

17:47.880 --> 17:50.430
He hasn't been since he
erm... since he got back.

17:50.480 --> 17:55.870
And he won't talk to me about
what happened to him so I erm...

17:55.920 --> 17:59.420
I thought he might have
said something to you.

18:00.040 --> 18:02.400
No, he hasn't.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.110
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have come. I...

18:08.160 --> 18:11.160
I just didn't know
who else to... ask.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.800
Henri was in Verdun.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.790
I don't know what that means.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.880
What happened?

18:23.360 --> 18:25.790
Thousands of 'em died.

18:25.840 --> 18:29.320
- Shelled, shot, gassed and starved.
- Starved?

18:31.920 --> 18:35.800
I heard some stuff here and there.
Supply lines got cut off.

18:37.600 --> 18:41.840
They were trapped, no food
or water, no way out.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.870
Agnes, there are some things
you don't wanna know.

18:46.920 --> 18:50.440
I have to... please.

18:55.720 --> 18:58.070
One soldier talked about bodies.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.550
Mounds of them piled up
and left there to rot.

19:00.600 --> 19:04.800
The living lying next to the dead.
Hell on earth he called it.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.700
So... So, that's what
happened to Henri?

19:14.120 --> 19:17.400
- I dunno.
- And what happened to you?

19:33.720 --> 19:37.000
- I've a club to run.
- Of course.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.480
Thank you.

19:48.080 --> 19:51.680
- This color is perfect for you.
- It's beautiful.

19:54.200 --> 19:58.310
- And how's little Ernest?
- Oh, he's a happy dumpling. I'm very lucky.

19:58.360 --> 20:01.660
Beautiful children and
a wonderful husband.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.550
And now this.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.960
Mr. Grove is so good to me.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.390
- Is everything all right, Doris?
- Yes.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.800
Perfectly.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.880
Morning.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.070
Have you been here all night?

20:34.640 --> 20:37.920
- I've been working on the beauty event.
- I was worried.

20:39.560 --> 20:43.470
I'm sorry. I just kept sketching,
thinking about the window and...

20:43.520 --> 20:46.190
.. and then I had all these ideas.

20:46.240 --> 20:49.520
- Can I see?
- When they're ready, yes.

20:50.920 --> 20:55.080
You used to do that all the time.
'Don't look, it's not ready.'

20:56.360 --> 20:58.710
Yes, I did.

20:58.760 --> 21:01.360
I feel like I used to. Excited.

21:03.240 --> 21:07.230
Well, do you want to go home and
get some sleep? Have some breakfast?

21:07.280 --> 21:09.640
When I'm finished.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.440
Thank you.

21:31.480 --> 21:34.950
- I've had a lovely time. Thank you.
- It was my pleasure.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.360
Goodbye.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.000
No! Go away!

21:44.640 --> 21:46.230
- Let go!
- Doris?

21:46.280 --> 21:48.640
Just leave me alone!

21:51.360 --> 21:53.550
- Are you all right? Who was that?
- I don't know.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.670
- Was it one of those men from outside?
- I'm sure he was harmless.

21:56.720 --> 22:00.320
Now, please, I'm quite all right.
I'll get a taxi home. Don't worry.

22:13.280 --> 22:19.950
Ma'am, I took the liberty of visiting
Princess Marie's flat yesterday.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.590
- Go on.
- Well, she said it was being redecorated.

22:24.640 --> 22:29.110
While she racks up a huge hotel
bill in Mr. Selfridge's name. Yes.

22:29.160 --> 22:35.880
I saw no sign of renovation and
the family who live there now
would find it most inconvenient.

22:36.840 --> 22:41.790
They rented the apartment when
the previous resident moved out,

22:41.840 --> 22:45.230
leaving several unpaid
bills behind her.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.640
Princess Marie?

22:50.360 --> 22:52.830
Thank you, Fraser. Good work.

22:53.520 --> 22:55.880
Ma'am.

23:14.880 --> 23:17.230
Can I help?

23:17.280 --> 23:19.640
I need to do this myself.

23:20.680 --> 23:23.880
I need to know if I
still have it in me.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.070
You haven't slept in 24 hours now.

23:27.120 --> 23:34.120
Please, this is the first time I've felt like
I'm really here... doing what I used to.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.560
See you later.

24:34.900 --> 24:38.210
Cosmetics demonstrations
are in the Palm Court.

24:38.260 --> 24:41.690
If you'd like to make your
way up, we'll begin shortly.

24:41.740 --> 24:44.060
Morning. Morning.

24:45.940 --> 24:47.050
Hello. Morning.

24:47.100 --> 24:51.610
Most of us learn about
beauty from our mothers.

24:51.660 --> 24:55.250
But these products are all new.

24:55.300 --> 24:57.850
Well, my mother wouldn't
know where to begin.

24:57.900 --> 25:03.250
She might also wonder if
it was all entirely proper.

25:05.060 --> 25:09.770
I'd like to show you that the right
product, applied correctly,

25:09.820 --> 25:12.970
can enhance your natural beauty.

25:13.020 --> 25:15.890
If you'd all like to choose a table.

25:17.300 --> 25:21.570
Creme rouge can add a healthy
glow, brightening the complexion

25:21.620 --> 25:24.900
and giving the skin a more
youthful appearance.

25:26.740 --> 25:30.530
An elegant eyebrow
will frame the face.

25:30.580 --> 25:35.180
While darkening the lash-line
will make eyelashes seem longer.

25:36.340 --> 25:41.460
And this, this is our
greatest innovation.

25:42.900 --> 25:45.260
A stick of lip color...

25:47.820 --> 25:49.860
.. in a tube.

26:06.700 --> 26:09.100
Can I help, Madam Selfridge?

26:09.940 --> 26:13.890
May I ask, does the Bureau deal
with personal information?

26:13.940 --> 26:19.100
- We deal with everything.
- It's an inquiry of a rather delicate nature.

26:23.340 --> 26:26.410
Princess Marie Wiasemsky.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.770
I wanna know when she left Russia,

26:28.820 --> 26:31.860
how long she was in Paris, where
she has lived in England,

26:32.940 --> 26:35.290
.. who her creditors are.
Everything about her.

26:35.340 --> 26:38.130
I want to know who
this woman really is.

26:38.180 --> 26:41.890
Mr. Selfridge, Miss Webb is here.

26:41.940 --> 26:43.220
Ah.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.850
It's good to see...

26:46.900 --> 26:49.260
Have a seat, please.

26:49.860 --> 26:54.770
- I got your note.
- Ah. So, then you know I'm now the
proud owner of an expensive field.

26:54.820 --> 26:56.570
- It's wonderful.
- Hm.

26:56.620 --> 27:01.650
- Now you have the land, you'll need
architects, engineers, construction firms...
- I think what I need is you.

27:01.700 --> 27:05.930
Hear me out. I know you have your own interests,
your own company but I need a manager.

27:05.980 --> 27:08.180
I'll pay you, of course.

27:10.300 --> 27:14.810
- Mr. Selfridge, I would be delighted.
- Oh. Then we have a lot to talk about.

27:14.860 --> 27:17.770
- Er, tomorrow afternoon?
- Done.

27:17.820 --> 27:22.290
If we're going to be working together, there
are some people that I'd like you to meet.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.770
Ladies, I'm glad that you made it.

27:24.820 --> 27:28.210
I thought a bit of shopping would
be a welcome distraction.

27:28.260 --> 27:30.730
I would like you to
meet Miss Nancy Webb.

27:30.780 --> 27:33.210
Miss Webb, this is Princess Marie.

27:33.260 --> 27:37.770
- Proud mother-in-law to Rosalie.
- And this is Violette.

27:37.820 --> 27:42.530
I'm not married, I don't have a job so
shopping is pretty much all I'm good for.

27:42.580 --> 27:45.290
- I'm sure that's not true.
- No.

27:45.340 --> 27:49.770
- Do you work here?
- Actually, Miss Webb is going to be
managing the Homes For Heroes Scheme.

27:49.820 --> 27:55.370
Ah, yes, all those little
houses. How exciting.

27:55.420 --> 27:59.290
- We must go to cosmetics demonstration.
- Are you coming?

27:59.340 --> 28:01.890
I wanna look like Gloria Swanson.

28:01.940 --> 28:08.450
- Oh, that awful nose, such
long face, like horse.
- Oh, no.

28:08.500 --> 28:12.130
No. She has such a
natural aristocracy.

28:12.180 --> 28:15.770
- You'd be most welcome.
- Thank you.

28:15.820 --> 28:18.180
Please.

28:23.380 --> 28:27.530
Mrs. Leclair? These came in this morning.
They should have been in Monday.

28:27.580 --> 28:28.930
They need to go in the window.

28:28.980 --> 28:32.370
- Er... I'll ask Mr. Leclair when he comes in.
- Where is he?

28:32.420 --> 28:36.570
- He was up all night working.
I'm sure he won't be long.
- Then I'll do it myself.

28:36.620 --> 28:39.300
No. I'll... I'll do it.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.820
Oh, as quick as you can, please.

29:07.740 --> 29:10.100
What are you doing?

29:10.900 --> 29:14.050
- Kitty asked me to put these in.
- It's my window.

29:14.100 --> 29:17.650
- You weren't here so...
- Cos you didn't wake me.

29:17.700 --> 29:20.570
Well, I thought you needed the sleep.

29:23.260 --> 29:26.650
- I worked all night on this.
- It's just powder.

29:26.700 --> 29:28.850
- Boxes of powder.
- No, no, no, no. It was mine.

29:28.900 --> 29:32.220
- I was just trying to help.
- I don't want your help!

29:34.260 --> 29:37.530
Then what do you want?

29:37.580 --> 29:41.890
- Please tell me because
I can't go on like this.
- Like what?

29:41.940 --> 29:45.170
- You barely say a word to me.
- What do you want me to say?

29:45.220 --> 29:48.450
- You spent four years at war.
- Yeah, and now it's over.

29:48.500 --> 29:55.210
Something's changed. We're like
strangers and it's... killing me.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.610
Don't say that, please!

29:57.660 --> 30:00.020
I even went to see Victor.

30:04.620 --> 30:07.380
- What?
- I asked him about Verdun.

30:09.780 --> 30:13.330
- And what would he know?
- He's told me more than you have.

30:13.380 --> 30:17.970
- Oh, I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment.
- Stop it. That's not what I'm trying to say.

30:18.020 --> 30:20.380
Then what?

30:21.420 --> 30:23.780
What's going on?

30:26.620 --> 30:29.370
I lie next to you every night.

30:29.420 --> 30:34.370
I hear you cry in your sleep and
when I hold you, you hold onto me

30:34.420 --> 30:37.860
but when you wake up,
you push me away.

30:39.620 --> 30:44.500
- I know that you've been
through some awful things.
- You don't know anything!

30:51.900 --> 30:54.260
That's enough!

31:16.740 --> 31:19.090
No. I'll do it. Please.

31:19.140 --> 31:22.380
It's my fault. I'll put it all right.

31:30.860 --> 31:33.210
Henri?

31:33.260 --> 31:35.620
Oh, for God's sake.

31:36.700 --> 31:39.060
Oh, my God. Come here.

31:49.140 --> 31:52.460
C'est moi. C'est moi.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.740
Hey, Henri. It's Harry. It's Harry.

31:59.900 --> 32:02.260
Who did you think I was?

32:05.060 --> 32:07.260
- They're dying.
- Who are?

32:08.140 --> 32:11.370
- All of them. My men.
- No, no. There's no-one here.

32:11.420 --> 32:14.650
- It's just you and me.
- They're everywhere.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.060
They beg me for water.

32:18.100 --> 32:20.450
I can't help them.

32:20.500 --> 32:25.010
- I hear them crying.
- Henri, where are you going?

32:25.060 --> 32:27.420
Henri?

32:47.560 --> 32:50.710
- You're up late.
- I thought you were Henri.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.360
- Have you seen him?
- Not tonight.

32:55.280 --> 32:58.230
- What are you doing?
- I have to go and find him.

32:58.280 --> 33:01.480
It's three in the morning,
don't be daft. Oi!

33:06.080 --> 33:10.000
- What happened?
- We had an argument.

33:11.440 --> 33:15.710
- Well, more than that.
- He'll be back when he's ready.

33:15.760 --> 33:18.630
What if something happens to him?

33:18.680 --> 33:21.960
He survived four years
in France. He'll be fine.

33:24.880 --> 33:27.920
George? I didn't mean to...

33:30.720 --> 33:32.920
- Are you all right?
- Me?

33:33.800 --> 33:36.160
Course I am.

33:38.200 --> 33:41.700
You know, you never talk
to me about the war.

33:43.800 --> 33:47.920
Some days... I hardly think about it.

33:48.760 --> 33:54.320
Others, everything around you looks
the same but it's like it's not real.

33:56.040 --> 33:59.550
It could all break apart any minute.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.670
So, what do you do?

34:01.720 --> 34:04.240
You get through the day...

34:05.480 --> 34:07.840
.. hope it gets better.

34:11.920 --> 34:15.480
Just wait for him.
That's all you can do.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.280
Sorry.

34:57.120 --> 35:00.630
Have we heard from Henri? Miss Mardle
said he didn't go home last night.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.760
- No.
- If I may...

35:03.480 --> 35:08.160
I have seen something similar
in my former regiment.

35:09.080 --> 35:11.430
Extreme behavior out of character.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.270
This...

35:13.320 --> 35:17.760
The euphoria of getting home
and then one realizes...

35:19.000 --> 35:24.550
memories, feelings, simply have
no place in day-to-day life.

35:24.600 --> 35:29.670
What about a period of leave? Time to
reflect away from the pressures of work?

35:29.720 --> 35:32.070
Perhaps.

35:32.120 --> 35:38.120
Sometimes, making a chap feel useless,
the worst thing you can do.

35:39.440 --> 35:43.520
Well, I can't just close the door
on him. Henri is my closest friend.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.830
I'll find a role where
he's right beside me.

35:46.880 --> 35:49.350
Where I can look out for him.

35:50.360 --> 35:52.720
We have to find him first.

35:54.480 --> 35:57.800
All the products you saw at the beauty
event are on sale today, madam.

36:00.440 --> 36:05.550
- What are you doing here?
- Your sister spends an hour
in the bathroom SINGING.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.830
Then she reads MY paper
and eats breakfast,

36:07.880 --> 36:12.030
getting crumbs over as much of the table
as she can, all while I'm trying to work.

36:12.080 --> 36:16.310
- She needs to find another
job, get her own place.
- I've got a book to write.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.720
I'll talk to her.

36:27.800 --> 36:30.160
Read all about it!

36:31.360 --> 36:34.190
- Come and get your paper!
- One, please.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.720
- All right.
- Thank you.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.700
There you are.

37:00.920 --> 37:03.310
- Mr. Edwards.
- I need a favor.

37:03.360 --> 37:07.150
Somewhere to interview these two for a couple
of hours. It's for a book I'm writing.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.790
- Life after the war.
- Will I be in it?

37:09.840 --> 37:13.280
- You never know.
- Hm. We don't open till six.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.160
I won't tell if you don't.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.880
Come on.

37:25.800 --> 37:30.120
Please. Mrs. Edwards, beauty
sales are through the roof.

37:31.160 --> 37:35.040
Have a think about what your department
needs and if I can help, it's yours.

37:36.880 --> 37:41.470
Erm, well, actually, erm...
there is something.

37:41.520 --> 37:44.590
It's... it's my sister Connie.

37:44.640 --> 37:47.910
She used to work here in the
loading bay and then Fashion.

37:47.960 --> 37:51.870
She needs a firm hand
but she's bright

37:51.920 --> 37:55.990
and she learns fast and...

37:56.040 --> 37:59.670
I'm being ever so bold, Mr. Selfridge,

37:59.720 --> 38:03.510
but I know that family is the
most important thing to you

38:03.560 --> 38:09.600
and the store is one big family,
in a way, and she needs a job.

38:11.760 --> 38:14.920
Jobs go on merit not
family connection.

38:17.160 --> 38:20.190
But isn't it wonderful
when they can be both?

38:20.240 --> 38:26.070
I know you must feel that way
about Mr. Gordon, your son.

38:26.120 --> 38:30.400
He's done ever so well here, hasn't he?
He's a chip off the old block, isn't he?

38:36.760 --> 38:40.320
No-one but YOU could
get away with THAT.

38:41.600 --> 38:44.150
I'm sure Miss Mardle
would welcome the help.

38:44.200 --> 38:48.230
- Your sister can have the job.
- Thank you, Mr. Selfridge.

38:48.280 --> 38:49.790
Thank you.

38:49.840 --> 38:52.990
- What did you do before the war?
- I worked in a laundry.

38:53.040 --> 38:55.110
I was a warehouseman.

38:55.520 --> 39:00.080
- We were slow getting demobbed. By the
time we got back, there were no jobs.
- They gave my job to a girl.

39:01.840 --> 39:05.390
Said she was just as good
and they could pay her less.

39:05.440 --> 39:09.510
- They should have kicked 'em
all out when we come home.
- Elsa?

39:09.560 --> 39:13.190
- Who? The women?
- How's it right that we're
out on the streets scraping by

39:13.240 --> 39:16.950
while they swan around giving themselves
airs and graces for pin money?

39:17.000 --> 39:20.190
You have this idea of home
when you're in the trenches.

39:20.240 --> 39:23.550
- It keeps you going.
- Yeah.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.710
And then you come back.

39:25.760 --> 39:28.360
Nowhere to live...

39:29.440 --> 39:31.800
Heroes, my arse.

39:36.320 --> 39:38.720
Someone oughta do something.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.520
Henri?

40:18.440 --> 40:22.070
- Your wife's designs.
- And the Selfridge Estate.

40:22.120 --> 40:25.310
- They're really quite similar.
- It's a good start.

40:25.360 --> 40:29.030
I'm off home now, Mr. Selfridge.

40:29.080 --> 40:31.310
Of course. Thank you, Miss Plunkett.

40:31.360 --> 40:34.430
- Don't forget. You have
tickets for the theater.
- I won't.

40:34.480 --> 40:37.590
Now, it's women who
run these households

40:37.640 --> 40:41.430
- and no-one ever asks them
what they want so I did.
- Hm.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.670
Here's some research
and a survey I ran

40:43.720 --> 40:47.350
shows that what these people really
want is hot and cold running water.

40:47.400 --> 40:50.670
Electricity throughout
each and every house,

40:50.720 --> 40:54.280
a private lavatory inside,
and a private garden...

41:15.880 --> 41:17.820
- Victor.
- Violette.

41:18.600 --> 41:22.910
- Your French gentleman not with you?
- No, and he's not mine.

41:22.960 --> 41:25.310
So, you're on your own?

41:25.360 --> 41:29.510
You're thinking no decent girl
would come out without an escort.

41:29.560 --> 41:35.190
- That's not what I'm thinking.
- You have no idea what kind of girl I am.

41:35.240 --> 41:39.480
And you don't know anything about
me so I guess that makes us equal.

41:45.960 --> 41:48.790
Let's start over again.
What do you want to drink?

41:48.840 --> 41:52.470
- Sorry we had to stop.
- Oh, no, you must go to the theater.

41:52.520 --> 41:56.470
- At least let me get you a cab.
- You're very kind, Mr. Selfridge.

41:56.520 --> 41:59.560
- Harry, please.
- Nancy.

42:05.400 --> 42:07.760
Here we go.

42:09.600 --> 42:14.120
- I've looked everywhere for him.
- He'll come back to you, my dear.

42:15.160 --> 42:18.280
Because he loves you
and you love him.

42:20.240 --> 42:25.470
Maybe that's not enough. Whatever's happened
to him in the war's changed him.

42:25.520 --> 42:27.870
I don't know him any more.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.960
He frightens me.

42:32.160 --> 42:34.520
Oh, Agnes.

42:47.360 --> 42:49.390
Can you spare a copper?

42:49.440 --> 42:51.800
You bitch.

42:53.200 --> 42:58.110
- What did you say?
- You can't spare a penny for a man
who fought for King and country?

42:58.160 --> 43:01.360
Did you spend it all
on drawers and rouge?

43:02.400 --> 43:07.390
- I wasn't shopping. I'm working late.
- Oh, we knew a few working
girls back in France.

43:07.440 --> 43:10.190
Yeah, they made a pretty penny
lying flat on their backs.

43:10.240 --> 43:13.670
- You'd make a fortune.
- I'm head of department!

43:13.720 --> 43:16.870
- Oh, get lady muck.
- And you still can't spare a copper?

43:16.920 --> 43:21.310
- Keeping honest men out of a job.
- I work in Beauty.

43:21.360 --> 43:24.950
I sell lip color and creams and
I've just worked a 14-hour day.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.740
It's no wonder you can't get jobs.

43:28.120 --> 43:30.790
- Drinking on the street. You're a disgrace.
- Shut it!

43:30.840 --> 43:33.200
Get your hands off!

43:39.440 --> 43:41.800
You go and keep watch now.

43:43.480 --> 43:45.840
Come here.

43:52.160 --> 43:56.110
Hey! Hey! What the hell
are you - Hey! Hey!

43:56.160 --> 43:58.470
Police! Police!

43:58.520 --> 44:02.030
- Police.
- What happened? Oh, my God.

44:16.200 --> 44:19.110
A young lady was attacked
yesterday evening.

44:19.160 --> 44:24.110
I've also got a witness says he saw some
men leaving this club drunk as lords.

44:24.160 --> 44:27.550
- I'm almost scared to walk home tonight.
- Then don't.

44:27.600 --> 44:30.910
We've been saying we'll go
out for ages, so, let's.

44:30.960 --> 44:34.110
- You must make her understand
what you're going through.
- I can't.

44:34.160 --> 44:38.670
- You must tell her. Let
her know what's going on.
- Tell her what? That she's
married to a coward?

44:38.720 --> 44:41.110
He's so different from
the man that he was.

44:41.160 --> 44:43.550
He needs you now more than ever.

44:43.600 --> 44:46.190
Don't give up on him.
