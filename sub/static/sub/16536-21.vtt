00:01.419 --> 00:03.129
<i>Previously on "Designated Survivor"...</i>

00:03.254 --> 00:05.256
<i>Abe Leonard asserts Al-Sakar
was not responsible</i>

00:05.381 --> 00:06.966
<i>for the attack of the Capitol.</i>

00:07.091 --> 00:08.634
The jackals are at the door,
Mr. President.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.302
I think we're really close
to cracking this thing.

00:10.428 --> 00:13.514
Your lead investigator is missing. The
man who tried to kill you is still alive.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.850
And the mole in the White House
remains unknown.

00:15.975 --> 00:18.602
I am relieving you of your command,
effective immediately.

00:18.728 --> 00:20.646
- What?
- General, you are fired.

00:22.606 --> 00:25.943
- You kill my family... I kill yours.
- Jason...

00:28.571 --> 00:31.323
It's all working.
Everyone's focused on the FBI, not us.

00:31.449 --> 00:33.325
- Where is Hannah?
- On assignment.

00:33.451 --> 00:36.328
I want every container
opened and searched.

00:42.585 --> 00:45.129
- Get your hands behind your head!
- Hands behind your head!

00:46.130 --> 00:47.298
On the ground right now!

00:47.423 --> 00:49.341
Hands above your head!
Get on your knees!

00:49.467 --> 00:51.635
- You don't understand!
- Now! On the ground!

00:51.761 --> 00:54.847
Put your hands where I can see them!
Get on the ground! Do it!

00:54.972 --> 00:56.849
- Okay.
- Get on your knees!

00:56.974 --> 01:00.394
I said get on the ground!
I'm not gonna ask you again!

01:00.519 --> 01:02.480
Get back, or I'll detonate it!

01:03.689 --> 01:07.151
Get back or I'll blow it!
Put your guns down!

01:07.276 --> 01:08.903
- I mean it!
- Stop. Nobody fires.

01:09.028 --> 01:10.196
Get back!

01:10.321 --> 01:11.947
Get back!

01:15.326 --> 01:17.578
Go, go!

01:17.703 --> 01:19.663
Go back! Up the stairs!

01:24.001 --> 01:25.711
Get out of the way!

01:44.021 --> 01:44.980
Come on!

02:27.773 --> 02:30.192
Freeze! Let me see your hands!
Hold it right there!

02:41.287 --> 02:44.165
- Sir.
- What have you got?

02:44.290 --> 02:46.083
The FBI has her in custody.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.085
I want to talk to her
as soon as possible.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.253
Yes, sir.

02:52.548 --> 02:55.259
I already told you;
I had nothing to do with this.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.178
I woke up in the back of the van--

02:57.303 --> 02:59.013
What about the schematics
we found in your apartment?

02:59.138 --> 03:01.348
The structural blueprints to the garage?

03:01.473 --> 03:03.475
You parked your van right under
a load-bearing beam,

03:03.601 --> 03:06.812
which is exactly where you'd want to park
if you want to take the building down.

03:06.937 --> 03:11.150
Hannah. Thank God you're okay.
Get those cuffs off her right now.

03:11.275 --> 03:12.818
She's a lead suspect
in a terrorist attack.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.154
- The hell she is. Let her go.
- Under whose authority?

03:15.279 --> 03:16.697
The president of the United States.

03:16.822 --> 03:17.990
Yeah, right.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.075
- He wants her in his office ASAP.
- Yeah.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.245
Dan, I got the White House on the line.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.165
You were saying?

03:31.128 --> 03:32.463
You all right?

03:38.761 --> 03:40.095
They killed Jason.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.309
All right, we have to tell
the president what we know.

04:03.035 --> 04:06.413
They wanted to blame me for an attack,
so they planted evidence in my apartment.

04:06.538 --> 04:09.708
They called the FBI, said that
I'd be in the garage with a bomb.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.085
We're interrogating the suspects

04:11.210 --> 04:14.004
that we arrested on the freighter.
They're giving up intel on the cells.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.256
What about Lloyd?

04:15.381 --> 04:17.757
The only link that we've managed to find
is between the ship

04:17.882 --> 04:21.220
and a defunct subsidiary of
Browning Reed. It's not a smoking gun.

04:21.345 --> 04:24.056
So what? You need to bring
that bastard in, Tom.

04:24.181 --> 04:25.057
I agree, sir.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.226
There's no point
in bringing him in today

04:27.351 --> 04:28.852
if we have to let him out tomorrow.

04:28.978 --> 04:30.938
We need to play this the same way
that we did MacLeish.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.189
Look how that turned out.

04:38.070 --> 04:38.988
Sir?

04:39.989 --> 04:41.198
I agree with them.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.202
Especially given the fact
that we don't know

04:45.327 --> 04:47.913
who the traitor is in the White House.
Bring him in.

04:48.038 --> 04:51.625
Our target is Patrick Lloyd.
We believe that he is responsible

04:51.750 --> 04:53.043
for the bombing on our Capitol.

04:53.168 --> 04:57.339
He currently resides on a 100-acre
horse farm west of Warrenton, Virginia.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.551
We should assume he is heavily armed.

05:02.177 --> 05:04.471
He killed our friends,
and he killed our leaders.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.765
We will take him alive
and we will make him pay

05:06.890 --> 05:09.059
for everything he took from us.
Is everyone clear on that?

05:09.184 --> 05:10.102
Yes.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.729
<i>All right. Let's move out.</i>

05:20.112 --> 05:23.282
<i>Is there an FBI conspiracy
in the Kirkman Administration?</i>

05:23.407 --> 05:25.784
<i>It's very concerning, Nate,
very concerning.</i>

05:25.909 --> 05:27.619
<i>I mean, what we now know,
it casts doubt</i>

05:27.745 --> 05:29.455
<i>on</i> everything <i>the president
has ever told us.</i>

05:29.580 --> 05:30.998
<i>How are we supposed to trust him?</i>

05:31.123 --> 05:32.875
Come in.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.294
What have you got?

05:35.419 --> 05:38.797
So far, we've identified cells
in Montana, Arizona,

05:38.922 --> 05:40.924
Pennsylvania, New Jersey
and New Mexico.

05:41.050 --> 05:44.303
Now, the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force
on Domestic Threats is moving teams

05:44.428 --> 05:47.473
into position so we can coordinate
the raids, not tip them off.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.600
You know, I read their manifesto.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.769
It was ridiculous.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.271
They use just the right amount
of historical quotes

05:54.396 --> 05:55.814
to try and make themselves
sound legitimate.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.274
They're not political.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.485
This was a power grab, an attempted coup.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.862
- Where are we at with Lloyd?
- Tactical team's en route.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.655
We'll have him in custody
within the hour.

06:03.781 --> 06:06.283
- I want updates as soon as they come in.
- Yes, sir.

06:06.408 --> 06:09.411
- Great work, Director Foerstel. Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

06:11.914 --> 06:13.290
<i>That's an excellent argument,
Senator Bowman,</i>

06:13.415 --> 06:16.710
<i>but I'm sure my next guest
will probably disagree,</i>

06:16.835 --> 06:19.338
recent White House
chief of staff Aaron Shore.

06:19.463 --> 06:20.506
Thank you, Nate.

06:20.631 --> 06:24.301
So, what do you say to all the Americans
out there who are worried

06:24.426 --> 06:27.346
- about a government conspiracy?
- I'd say that President Kirkman is

06:27.471 --> 06:29.723
probably the most honest man
I've ever met.

06:29.848 --> 06:33.352
And I think you and Senator Bowman
are both trying to score political points

06:33.477 --> 06:35.020
over matters of national security.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.898
Are you saying this story
isn't true, then, Mr. Shore?

06:38.023 --> 06:40.526
I'm saying I haven't been fully briefed,
and neither has the senator,

06:40.651 --> 06:43.028
so neither one of us should be
making any kind of accusations.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.531
Well, the fact remains - if these are
matters of national security -

06:45.656 --> 06:47.199
the president should just say so.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.410
But so far, he's said nothing.
That's a disservice.

06:49.535 --> 06:52.371
<i>Knowing the president as well as I do,</i>

06:52.496 --> 06:55.082
<i>I'm sure if he's holding on
to any kind of secret,</i>

06:55.207 --> 06:57.668
<i>it's for the safety
of the American people.</i>

06:58.001 --> 07:00.254
<i>If anyone is doing a disservice here,
it's</i> you.

07:00.379 --> 07:04.258
<i>Stay tuned tomorrow, folks.
This story's not going anywhere.</i>

07:06.844 --> 07:09.096
<i>- Moore.</i>
- It's Wells. You have eyes on Lloyd?

07:09.221 --> 07:11.348
<i>- Yeah, he's still in the house.</i>
- All right, good.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.183
- Hold your position. We're en route.
<i>- Copy.</i>

08:46.235 --> 08:47.402
Agent Wells!

08:50.072 --> 08:52.574
- All clear here.
- We got nothing here too.

09:03.919 --> 09:07.673
I want a list of every plane,
truck, car, ship, helicopter

09:07.798 --> 09:10.133
registered to Browning Reed
or their subsidiaries,

09:10.259 --> 09:11.468
and I want it tracked <i>now.</i>

09:11.593 --> 09:13.887
- That means FAA, it means state DMV--
- Agent Wells!

09:14.012 --> 09:16.848
--it means ATL, law enforcement.
Whatever you have to do, you get it done.

09:16.974 --> 09:17.891
- Agent Wells.
- Yeah.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.727
Virginia highway patrol said they
spotted a vehicle registered to Lloyd

09:20.852 --> 09:23.021
- driving south on the interstate.
- Open the walkie.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.440
Agent Wells!

09:26.858 --> 09:29.570
I got a Patrick Lloyd sighting
at a traffic stop in Chesapeake.

09:29.695 --> 09:32.864
TSA says they got eyes on him
over at Raleigh-Durham International.

09:32.990 --> 09:36.034
They're now saying his credit card was
just used at a bus station in Pittsburgh.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.495
I got a hit on his ATM card
in Plano, Texas.

09:38.620 --> 09:39.830
Shell game.

09:40.622 --> 09:41.957
Damn it!

09:45.168 --> 09:47.004
Everyone's asking
when the next briefing is.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.881
Well, until I can give them
something more than a "No comment,"

09:50.007 --> 09:52.843
I'm gonna stay away from the press
for as long as possible.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.053
How's that working out for you?

09:55.178 --> 09:56.847
And I'm gonna start
locking my office door.

09:56.972 --> 09:59.391
Oh, that's not gonna slow <i>me</i> down.
Trust me.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.852
- What do you want, Abe?
- A White House comment.

10:01.977 --> 10:04.730
I already gave your story a "No comment."
Haven't we done this before?

10:04.855 --> 10:06.189
I feel like it's Groundhog Day with you.

10:06.315 --> 10:09.192
Al-Sakar was yesterday's story.
I'm talking about tomorrow's edition.

10:09.318 --> 10:11.862
"No comment" is not gonna
cut it this time.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.989
It's a good movie, though.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.244
Mr. President.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.539
- Major flag for you, sir.
- What is it?

10:22.664 --> 10:25.125
Abe Leonard is running a story claiming

10:25.250 --> 10:27.586
that FBI Deputy Director Jason Atwood

10:27.711 --> 10:31.089
was arrested in the Oval
for the murder of Majid Nassar.

10:31.214 --> 10:34.509
He says the White House covered it up.
How do you want to respond to this?

10:38.889 --> 10:40.599
Tell Mr. Leonard I want to see him.

10:40.724 --> 10:42.059
Sorry?

10:42.184 --> 10:44.436
Set up a meeting, face-to-face.

10:44.561 --> 10:45.896
Thank you.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.069
<i>I can't get through to him.</i>

10:52.194 --> 10:53.987
<i>He needs to address
the Abe Leonard story.</i>

10:54.112 --> 10:57.115
I know you want Tom
to behave like a politician,

10:57.240 --> 10:59.451
but that's just not who he is, Emily.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.828
But he is the president
of the United States, Alex.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.455
He needs to defend the office.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.541
Yes, I know, and he will...
in his own way.

11:08.251 --> 11:10.837
How long are you in town for?
I miss our lunches.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.464
I got to head back tonight.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.634
I'm just gonna grab a bite
with a friend at The Hay-Adams.

11:15.759 --> 11:16.968
<i>And, Emily?</i>

11:17.094 --> 11:18.720
It's gonna be okay.

11:19.262 --> 11:20.972
Right.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.269
- How did he get by us?
- Don't know.

11:26.395 --> 11:28.689
The working theory is
that the traitor tipped him off.

11:28.814 --> 11:31.358
And, unfortunately,
we're still no closer to finding him.

11:31.483 --> 11:34.486
We need to freeze his assets,
bleed the son of a bitch dry.

11:34.611 --> 11:37.614
Contact Treasury.
We'll have an executive order drafted.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.324
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.748
Every president has a defining crisis.

11:48.125 --> 11:51.128
You, Tom, have had several.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.880
But you are going to weather this.

11:54.005 --> 11:57.384
Because one way or another,
it's all coming to an end.

11:57.509 --> 11:58.969
And in the meantime?

11:59.094 --> 12:00.679
Brace for impact.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.433
Well, at least I'm getting better
at that.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.901
<i>- Ritter.</i>
- It's Chuck. Get to Hannah's office now.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.004
What is it?

13:17.214 --> 13:20.759
Okay, remember the hack that was used
to deliver the Majid Nassar video?

13:20.884 --> 13:23.386
Yeah. That attack destroyed
half the computers in the West Wing.

13:23.512 --> 13:26.389
Also left behind
a serious digital footprint.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.309
Now, working under the assumption
that our traitor was responsible

13:29.434 --> 13:33.313
for that hack as well, I've been keeping
an eye out for that same code

13:33.438 --> 13:36.149
in case it was used again.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.443
Our traitor just accessed SIPRNET.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.570
The Pentagon? What for?

13:40.695 --> 13:42.614
I don't know.
He's not in the mainframes.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.741
Looks like he just wanted
to create an I.D.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.701
An I.D. for who?

14:30.745 --> 14:33.123
- Sir? Aaron Shore.
- Thank you, Ava.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.877
- Mr. President.
- Aaron. Great to see you again.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.503
- You as well, sir.
- Please.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.505
I saw you on television earlier.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.507
I really appreciated
what you had to say.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.175
You know I'll always protect you, sir.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.136
I know, which is
why I've asked you here.

14:46.261 --> 14:49.431
What I'm about to tell you
is strictly classified.

14:51.641 --> 14:54.477
We know that there's a traitor
in the White House.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.397
We haven't been able to identify him,

14:57.522 --> 14:59.482
but we know he was involved
in the Capitol bombing

14:59.608 --> 15:02.986
and was instrumental in having me
appointed as the Designated Survivor.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.864
You were part
of President Richmond's staff.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.199
Do you have any idea who this could be?

15:08.325 --> 15:11.578
- So, it wasn't Langdon?
- Langdon's in custody.

15:11.703 --> 15:14.956
The person we're looking for is actively
destroying evidence of the conspiracy.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.542
I know this is a lot to take in.

15:19.836 --> 15:23.214
But I would like you to go back over
your records, see if anything stands out.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.176
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

15:27.135 --> 15:30.513
- Aaron, we don't have a lot of time.
- I'll get right to it, sir.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.896
<i>He created an I.D. for Lozano
to access the Pentagon.</i>

15:38.021 --> 15:39.189
What?

15:39.564 --> 15:41.566
You need to alert Pentagon
Force Protection right now.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.610
It's already done.
We've sent over his picture.

15:43.735 --> 15:47.614
- They're locking the building down now.
- Yeah, but the Pentagon's 583 acres.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.908
That gives him plenty of places to hide.

16:42.252 --> 16:45.922
- Mr. Leonard. Tom Kirkman.
- Mr. President.

16:46.047 --> 16:48.049
- Please.
- Thank you.

16:48.758 --> 16:51.886
So, Seth told me about
the story you wanted to run.

16:53.722 --> 16:56.182
Mr. President, if you think you're gonna
get me to back down,

16:56.307 --> 16:58.810
you're wasting your time. And you can send
all the goons you want,

16:58.935 --> 17:00.770
but I'm not staying silent.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.939
Well, I don't know exactly
what you're talking about.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.983
I haven't sent anyone anywhere.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.777
In fact, I've been perfectly clear
with the FBI:

17:07.902 --> 17:10.446
I will not tolerate
any intimidation of the press.

17:10.571 --> 17:13.324
Besides, apparently, if I want,
I can just throw you in jail.

17:13.450 --> 17:18.329
- Are you threatening me?
- No. The opposite.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.665
I'm trying to tell you
that I won't do that.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.666
I'm not gonna try
and make you do anything.

17:23.292 --> 17:24.544
Okay.

17:24.669 --> 17:28.089
I am asking you:
please, just hold your story.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.508
Are you saying it's wrong?

17:31.301 --> 17:32.677
It's incomplete.

17:33.470 --> 17:36.347
Well... how about
you fill in the blanks for me?

17:36.473 --> 17:38.141
I wish I could.

17:38.266 --> 17:41.144
Unfortunately, it's a matter
of national security.

17:45.648 --> 17:48.943
- Can I ask you a question, Mr. President?
- Yeah.

17:49.778 --> 17:52.822
If you were sitting on a story about
a government cover-up, would you

17:52.947 --> 17:55.116
trust a word the president said?

17:56.493 --> 17:57.660
Maybe not.

17:57.786 --> 18:01.122
But do you honestly believe if
a president was involved in a cover-up,

18:01.498 --> 18:05.043
that he'd be stupid enough to sit across
from a journalist such as yourself?

18:06.294 --> 18:08.838
My favorite president is
Franklin Roosevelt.

18:08.963 --> 18:10.965
I wanted to show you something.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.137
When do you think this picture was taken?

18:17.013 --> 18:20.892
Uh... oh...
I expect during the war.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.852
Any idea when it was published?

18:24.020 --> 18:26.356
Just after the president passed away.

18:26.689 --> 18:29.359
You see, during the war,
there was an understanding.

18:29.484 --> 18:31.611
It was more important
to project American strength

18:31.736 --> 18:33.613
than describe the president's frailties.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.199
The press had the photos,
but they chose not to use them.

18:37.158 --> 18:40.411
Now, you might not think that we're
in a war, but I promise you that we are,

18:40.537 --> 18:41.871
and if you publish that article,

18:41.996 --> 18:44.958
it's going to make it
that much more difficult for us to win.

18:45.083 --> 18:48.336
Now, I honestly wish I could tell you
what I know, but I can't.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.382
So... here we are.

18:53.716 --> 18:57.262
You're gonna have to make a choice;
whether you believe me or not.

19:14.445 --> 19:15.655
General Cochrane.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.158
Well. You're not the cable repairman.

19:21.870 --> 19:25.415
- How are you handling retirement?
- It's not retirement.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.418
It's house arrest.

19:29.127 --> 19:30.795
Well, you didn't leave Kirkman
a choice there.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.631
I don't blame Kirkman.
He did what he had to do.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.675
Well, that's quite the reversal.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.594
Opinions change.

19:37.719 --> 19:40.263
What are you doing here, Aaron?

19:41.890 --> 19:43.266
There's a traitor in the White House.

19:43.933 --> 19:47.437
And I'm looking into anyone with
high-level access who had any involvement

19:47.562 --> 19:50.815
- in choosing the Designated Survivor.
- That's not a long list.

19:51.232 --> 19:54.110
- Can you help?
- Why me?

19:54.944 --> 19:57.322
You served eight years
in the White House:

19:57.447 --> 20:00.783
NSC, military office, Joint Chiefs.

20:00.909 --> 20:03.620
No one knows more about security access
than you do.

20:12.587 --> 20:14.797
I need these systems back online
right away.

20:14.923 --> 20:16.841
Pentagon Force Protection.
This is Powell.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.677
This is FBI Agent Hannah Wells.
Have you found Lozano yet?

20:19.802 --> 20:21.971
No. And we're having trouble
with our security system.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.514
All of our surveillance cameras

20:23.640 --> 20:25.975
<i>are being scrambled somehow.
But we're working on it.</i>

20:38.321 --> 20:40.573
Let me tell you something
about the man you're looking for.

20:40.698 --> 20:43.034
Before the CIA, he worked
for the Pentagon for two years

20:43.159 --> 20:45.370
in the Counterintelligence
Field Activities Office.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.872
<i>He knows every single corner
of that building.</i>

20:47.997 --> 20:50.792
You need to get those cameras
up and running. We have to find him.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.871
I met with General Cochrane.
He helped me put together

21:28.997 --> 21:31.040
this list of staffers
inside the Richmond Administration

21:31.165 --> 21:32.750
that fit the criteria we're talking about:

21:32.875 --> 21:36.087
high-level access, involvement
in choosing the Designated Survivor.

21:36.212 --> 21:39.090
Great work. Get these to Agent Ritter
as quickly as possible.

21:39.215 --> 21:42.343
Yes, sir.
Uh... Mr. President, I do have to say:

21:43.177 --> 21:45.305
I couldn't have done this
without the general's help.

21:45.430 --> 21:47.724
I don't think he had anything to do
with the attack.

21:49.225 --> 21:50.768
Neither do I.

22:35.646 --> 22:38.649
<i>In pursuit of suspect,
heading towards Georgetown Rail Yard.</i>

22:38.775 --> 22:39.942
<i>Send backup.</i>

26:08.109 --> 26:09.652
It's not over.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.197
No victory...

26:13.698 --> 26:15.825
without sacrifice.

26:36.387 --> 26:38.014
Hey, Dennis!

26:39.348 --> 26:41.225
Uh... I think Dennis stepped away.

26:42.476 --> 26:45.229
You know, as far as gatekeepers go,
there's a lot to be desired here.

26:45.354 --> 26:47.064
I think maybe it's time
to trade up, Seth.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.275
You know, you should just
move in at this point.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.861
I prefer the view
from my side of the street.

26:52.403 --> 26:53.863
What do you want, Abe?

26:53.988 --> 26:55.948
Look... I want you to tell the president

26:56.073 --> 26:58.200
I thought long and hard
about what he said to me.

27:00.161 --> 27:02.079
I'm going to honor his request.

27:02.872 --> 27:05.708
But... not indefinitely.

27:06.834 --> 27:09.003
I'm... speechless.
I don't know what to say.

27:09.879 --> 27:12.882
Huh. Not the best quality
for a press secretary.

27:13.007 --> 27:14.508
Uh...

27:15.009 --> 27:17.219
Well, I-let me just say "thank you."

27:18.095 --> 27:19.513
That'll work.

27:20.014 --> 27:21.807
Don't think for a second
I'm going soft here.

27:21.932 --> 27:24.143
I'll still be kicking your ass
all over the schoolyard.

27:24.268 --> 27:25.436
You know where to find me.

27:40.576 --> 27:41.619
Hannah.

27:42.244 --> 27:43.704
Hey, Chuck.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.791
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

27:46.916 --> 27:49.293
Yeah.

27:51.128 --> 27:54.465
Can I get you a... hospital?

27:54.590 --> 27:57.301
- Or something?
- They already checked me out.

27:58.302 --> 28:02.181
Did you guys find out why Lozano
was at the Pentagon yet?

28:02.306 --> 28:03.933
Hopefully, we'll get answers soon.

28:06.060 --> 28:07.144
Yeah.

28:08.145 --> 28:09.605
Do you want me to stay?

28:10.940 --> 28:14.944
No. No, Foerstel needs you.
But check in as soon as you can.

28:15.486 --> 28:16.612
Yeah.

28:21.283 --> 28:23.327
Hey, before I forget, I wasn't...

28:23.452 --> 28:24.995
you know, snooping around or anything,

28:25.121 --> 28:26.956
but you got about
a thousand unread e-mails.

28:27.081 --> 28:29.959
Yeah, I've been busy.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.839
There's one from Jason Atwood.

28:38.342 --> 28:39.760
I thought you'd like to know.

28:41.971 --> 28:43.305
Thank you.

29:09.331 --> 29:12.835
<i>The operation is still viable.
Right now, I'm brooming any connection</i>

29:12.960 --> 29:15.045
<i>between you, Browning Reed,
and the Capitol mission.</i>

29:15.171 --> 29:16.881
<i>Then I want to know
why there were</i>

29:17.006 --> 29:19.008
<i>two federal investigators
on my property.</i>

29:19.383 --> 29:21.385
<i>Don't worry about it. I'm on it.</i>

29:21.844 --> 29:24.054
<i>Soon, there'll be
no paper trail whatsoever.</i>

29:24.180 --> 29:27.016
<i>And Agent Wells is contained.</i>

29:29.018 --> 29:31.187
<i>Everything is proceeding as planned.</i>

29:31.312 --> 29:34.899
<i>And you're sure that the FBI has
no idea what's coming?</i>

29:35.024 --> 29:37.234
<i>- We have operational control.
- Good.</i>

29:37.359 --> 29:40.070
<i>Just make sure that the narrative
is what we want it to be.</i>

29:40.196 --> 29:43.574
<i>We are so close.
We might not have the presidency,</i>

29:43.699 --> 29:47.036
<i>but you can be damn sure that before
long, we will have the country.</i>

29:48.412 --> 29:49.830
Mr. Whitaker.

29:50.664 --> 29:52.416
Can I have a word, please?

30:25.241 --> 30:26.784
<i>Come in.</i>

30:29.036 --> 30:31.956
Deputy Director Atwood?
I'm Agent Hannah Wells.

30:32.081 --> 30:33.707
Yes, from Chicago.

30:35.084 --> 30:38.963
Agent Merritt tells me to tell you...
that he's still very pissed at you.

30:41.423 --> 30:43.843
Sir, Agent Merritt and I
didn't always see eye-to-eye.

30:43.968 --> 30:47.137
He also tells me that you disobeyed
practically every order he gave you.

30:47.263 --> 30:50.391
No, sir,
only the orders worth disobeying.

30:52.434 --> 30:55.312
He also says that you were
one of the best agents he's ever had,

30:55.437 --> 30:57.898
which is why he's mad at you for leaving.

30:58.440 --> 31:01.318
Well, like I was saying,
he was a great boss.

31:04.905 --> 31:09.743
Agent Wells... in all honesty,
will you cause me any trouble?

31:10.995 --> 31:12.496
Probably, sir.

31:18.836 --> 31:20.504
Welcome to D.C.

31:45.321 --> 31:47.031
<i>We are so close.</i>

31:47.156 --> 31:49.825
<i>We might not have the presidency,
but you can be damn sure</i>

31:49.950 --> 31:52.494
<i>that before long,
we will have the country.</i>

31:52.620 --> 31:55.998
And that's it. That's everything.

31:58.334 --> 32:01.337
I am very sorry for keeping you
in the dark for so long.

32:02.838 --> 32:05.841
But I didn't feel like I had any other
choice. I hope you can forgive me.

32:06.342 --> 32:08.969
- I understand, Mr. President.
- Same here, sir.

32:09.345 --> 32:12.222
So, Whitaker made you
Designated Survivor?

32:12.348 --> 32:15.059
Yes, as Homeland Security Advisor,
he was well-positioned

32:15.184 --> 32:17.019
to carry out a number
of operations for Lloyd.

32:17.144 --> 32:19.521
- Where's Lloyd now?
- We're still searching for him.

32:19.647 --> 32:22.608
But as the most wanted man on the planet,
it's just a matter of time.

32:22.733 --> 32:27.571
In the meantime, the FBI raided cells
from his organization across the country.

32:27.696 --> 32:32.034
<i>They've arrested over 200 people,
seizing firearms, bomb-making materials,</i>

32:32.159 --> 32:35.579
<i>including explosives, the same kind
that were used at the Capitol bombing.</i>

32:36.413 --> 32:37.581
Seth...

32:38.582 --> 32:40.584
it's time to tell
the American people the truth.

32:40.709 --> 32:43.545
Absolutely, I'll inform the networks,
make sure they clear some time.

32:43.671 --> 32:45.089
I don't want to speak from the Oval.

32:45.214 --> 32:47.591
I want to address Congress,
a joint session.

32:48.926 --> 32:50.928
Thank you, all of you.

32:53.055 --> 32:57.101
- For everything. Let's get back to work.
- Yes, sir.

33:00.771 --> 33:02.564
Aaron, can I borrow you for a moment?

33:05.359 --> 33:07.027
- Sir?
- What are your plans?

33:07.903 --> 33:10.614
I'm still figuring that out.

33:11.949 --> 33:14.118
I'd like you back here
at the White House.

33:14.243 --> 33:15.911
This is where you belong.

33:16.912 --> 33:20.749
I appreciate the gesture, Mr. President,
but... my position's been filled.

33:20.874 --> 33:23.460
- And Emily's doing a fantastic job.
- I couldn't agree with you more.

33:23.585 --> 33:27.423
- We'll find you another position.
- Frankly, sir, none exist.

33:27.548 --> 33:31.468
Then I'll make one up. Aaron, I want
you here. I'll draft you if I have to.

33:31.593 --> 33:34.763
But I won't take no for an answer.
What do you say to that?

33:38.267 --> 33:41.645
I say I serve at the pleasure
of the president.

33:42.104 --> 33:46.025
Good. 'Cause legally,
I actually don't think I can draft you.

33:46.150 --> 33:48.444
Welcome back.

33:48.902 --> 33:50.946
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank <i>you.</i>

33:57.286 --> 34:00.289
You ready for tonight?
Happy with your speech?

34:00.914 --> 34:03.167
I better be.
I wrote it myself this time.

34:04.918 --> 34:06.670
Well, I'm proud of you, son.

34:07.463 --> 34:11.550
And I'm going to be even prouder
when I watch you from my seat tonight.

34:11.675 --> 34:14.178
- I wanted to talk to you about that.
- Yeah.

34:14.303 --> 34:16.346
This is gonna be
the first time since the attack

34:16.472 --> 34:19.308
that the entire government
will be under the same roof.

34:19.433 --> 34:21.268
Now I have to make a decision...

34:22.603 --> 34:24.188
who to leave behind.

34:24.313 --> 34:26.398
I can't think of anyone
I would want more

34:26.523 --> 34:28.692
to be my Designated Survivor than you.

34:31.027 --> 34:33.906
You know, I used to think
that being Designated Survivor

34:34.031 --> 34:36.867
was a punishment, a joke.

34:36.992 --> 34:38.327
Me too.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.996
Not anymore.

34:44.458 --> 34:45.833
No, not anymore.

34:48.295 --> 34:51.380
- It would be my honor, Mr. President.
- Thank you.

35:01.683 --> 35:06.063
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of Congress,

35:06.188 --> 35:07.731
my fellow Americans.

35:08.357 --> 35:10.984
At the very beginning
of my presidency,

35:11.693 --> 35:14.404
in the shadow
of that terrible, fateful night,

35:14.905 --> 35:16.073
I spoke to you,

35:16.198 --> 35:20.536
and I promised absolute transparency,
absolute truth.

35:21.203 --> 35:24.957
<i>I betrayed that pledge in an effort
to protect an ongoing investigation</i>

35:25.082 --> 35:27.376
<i>by the FBI and the Secret Service.</i>

35:27.751 --> 35:31.088
<i>But tonight, I speak to you
with a lightened heart</i>

35:31.213 --> 35:33.465
<i>because I can finally
tell you the truth</i>

35:33.590 --> 35:35.592
<i>about what really happened to us.</i>

35:36.385 --> 35:37.594
<i>A recent article written</i>

35:37.719 --> 35:41.682
by one of our nation's most respected
journalists was correct:

35:42.224 --> 35:45.727
Al-Sakar did not attack our Capitol.

35:45.853 --> 35:47.479
Even though at the time,

35:47.604 --> 35:50.274
overwhelming evidence
suggested just that.

35:50.399 --> 35:52.651
We can tell you now,
with absolute certainty,

35:52.776 --> 35:56.238
that this horrific act was carried out

35:56.363 --> 35:59.783
by a domestic terror group,
led by a man named Patrick Lloyd.

36:00.409 --> 36:04.913
Lloyd and his followers believed that
American greatness was in its decline

36:05.038 --> 36:07.291
and that somehow,
we were no longer heirs

36:07.416 --> 36:10.919
to the generations
that pushed back the tide of fascism,

36:11.044 --> 36:12.880
put men on the moon,

36:13.797 --> 36:16.925
and relegated the Berlin Wall
to the pages of history.

36:17.050 --> 36:19.344
In short, these people believed

36:19.469 --> 36:21.263
that our best days were behind us

36:21.388 --> 36:25.434
and that they, themselves,
knew better how to remake our country.

36:25.809 --> 36:27.352
They were wrong

36:27.477 --> 36:29.855
<i>in every possible way.</i>

36:29.980 --> 36:33.317
<i>They debased the American Dream
and disrespected</i>

36:33.442 --> 36:36.320
<i>the incredible sacrifices
made by so many</i>

36:36.445 --> 36:38.530
<i>to build and sustain our nation.</i>

36:38.655 --> 36:41.200
<i>And even though the fabric of America
may have been frayed</i>

36:41.325 --> 36:43.368
<i>by their violence and hatred,</i>

36:43.493 --> 36:47.998
<i>I stand here rejoicing in the fact
that it was never torn.</i>

36:48.123 --> 36:52.252
In a time of unprecedented fear,
we did not abandon one another.

36:52.794 --> 36:54.963
Nor did we abandon our ideals,

36:55.088 --> 36:57.007
our sense of community,

36:57.132 --> 36:59.092
our commonalities.

36:59.801 --> 37:02.471
From the first responders
who answered the call,

37:02.596 --> 37:05.974
<i>racing into the flames
when tragedy struck,</i>

37:06.099 --> 37:08.727
<i>to the men and women
who fulfilled their civic duties</i>

37:08.852 --> 37:12.231
<i>by casting their ballots
even under the threat of attack,</i>

37:12.356 --> 37:14.858
<i>our better angels have shined through.</i>

37:15.776 --> 37:19.529
<i>Now, I know that there are times
when our country appears to be divided,</i>

37:19.655 --> 37:23.283
but I have seen the one thing
that will bind us together forever:

37:24.326 --> 37:25.661
love.

37:26.328 --> 37:30.249
Love of country,
love of hope, love of dreams,

37:30.374 --> 37:33.543
love of life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.

37:33.669 --> 37:36.755
I am a husband, I am a father,
and I am a son of this nation,

37:36.880 --> 37:40.926
and never before have I been
more proud, more optimistic.

37:44.471 --> 37:47.724
And I do not need you to tell me
that you feel the same way, too,

37:47.849 --> 37:51.520
because I can see it in your eyes
and hear it in your hearts.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.730
As Saint Paul admonished us,

37:53.855 --> 37:58.402
"Let us not be overcome by evil,
but overcome evil with good."

37:58.527 --> 38:01.113
<i>You see, America is not just simply
a country,</i>

38:01.238 --> 38:03.699
<i>nor is it the sum of its 50 states.</i>

38:04.324 --> 38:06.034
<i>It's an idea.</i>

38:06.159 --> 38:08.287
A bold and righteous idea,

38:08.412 --> 38:11.081
a guiding light
that can never be extinguished.

38:11.206 --> 38:13.583
So let us say to the rest of the world:

38:13.709 --> 38:16.461
we welcome your friendship
and extend an open hand

38:16.586 --> 38:20.048
to anyone who wants
to make lives freer and better.

38:24.511 --> 38:27.472
And to those who oppose us,
I can only simply warn you:

38:27.597 --> 38:30.142
your days are numbered,
for our time has come!

38:30.267 --> 38:34.396
I say again, our time has come.

38:37.441 --> 38:40.485
And to the American people, let me say

38:40.610 --> 38:43.488
that it has been the privilege
of my lifetime to serve you,

38:43.613 --> 38:47.451
and I promise to continue serving
until I am asked of service no more.

38:54.458 --> 38:56.376
Thank you for the honor.

38:56.793 --> 38:58.295
God bless you.

38:58.420 --> 39:00.922
And God bless
these United States of America.

39:02.215 --> 39:03.592
<i>Thank you.</i>

39:19.149 --> 39:20.317
Hey!

39:21.068 --> 39:22.277
Daddy!

39:23.278 --> 39:24.321
Little pea!

39:24.446 --> 39:26.365
Oh, my gosh!
What are you doing here? Leo!

39:26.490 --> 39:29.368
- Mom brought us.
- I couldn't keep them away any longer.

39:29.493 --> 39:31.620
Oh, my gosh. I missed you so much.

39:31.745 --> 39:33.372
You look so pretty.

39:33.497 --> 39:34.998
Excuse me, sir. Ma'am.

39:35.123 --> 39:36.166
What is it, Mike?

39:36.291 --> 39:37.959
You're needed in Command Ops right away.

39:39.795 --> 39:41.338
I promise I'll be right back, okay?

39:41.463 --> 39:43.632
- I love you.
- I love you, too, sweetheart.

39:44.174 --> 39:46.134
I'll be right back. I'm sorry.

39:52.849 --> 39:54.017
Mr. President.

39:54.142 --> 39:55.685
- At ease.
- Yes, sir.

39:55.811 --> 39:56.853
What's going on?

39:56.978 --> 39:59.564
Sir, we know what Lozano
was accessing at the Pentagon.

39:59.689 --> 40:03.026
He hacked the Defense Department's
most highly classified server.

40:03.485 --> 40:04.528
What does that mean?

40:04.653 --> 40:08.573
It means every single aspect
of our country's defense superstructure

40:08.698 --> 40:10.742
is now vulnerable: troop movements,

40:10.867 --> 40:14.287
intel on our nuclear arsenal,
identities of our covert assets.

40:14.663 --> 40:16.164
My God.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.918
We think that Lozano sent
the data to Patrick Lloyd.

40:20.043 --> 40:21.378
<i>Lloyd could hold us to ransom,</i>

40:21.503 --> 40:23.755
<i>sell off the information in pieces
to the highest bidder,</i>

40:23.880 --> 40:27.634
<i>- even militarize the intel himself.</i>
- Are we any closer to finding him?

40:28.802 --> 40:29.886
No, sir.

40:30.011 --> 40:32.556
<i>He has the resources to get himself
anywhere in the world</i>

40:32.681 --> 40:34.683
<i>without setting off any trip wires.</i>
