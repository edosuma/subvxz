00:07.551 --> 00:10.618
Yo, beemo, you done charging
up that phone, or what?

00:10.620 --> 00:14.253
Almost... finished.

00:14.255 --> 00:17.354
Thanks, beemo.

00:17.356 --> 00:19.520
All right, man. We're
gonna figure this out

00:19.523 --> 00:23.456
right... Now.

00:23.457 --> 00:26.256
<i>Yo, yo, yo, yo, check it!
This is Jake on my camera</i>

00:26.259 --> 00:29.057
<i>phone! Wh-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oa!</i>

00:29.059 --> 00:31.058
<i>Whoa, whoa! Yo, finn!</i>

00:31.061 --> 00:34.226
<i>- Say hi to my new camera phone.
- What up, camera phone?</i>

00:34.229 --> 00:36.727
<i>Lalalalalalalalalalala
lalalalalalalalalalalalalala...</i>

00:36.730 --> 00:39.795
<i>Lalalalalalalalalalalalala!</i>

00:39.798 --> 00:42.096
<i>Marceline! You guys
want to come party</i>

00:42.099 --> 00:45.264
<i>in the nightosphere with me?
I'm visiting with my dad, and</i>

00:45.265 --> 00:47.332
<i>- it's crazy boring.
- Whoa!</i>

00:47.333 --> 00:50.432
<i>Wait a minute, marceline.
Last time I saw your dad, I</i>

00:50.434 --> 00:53.634
<i>sliced open his soul sack.
Oh, no, he's totally chill</i>

00:53.635 --> 00:55.201
<i>- now.
- Okay, but I'm keeping</i>

00:55.202 --> 00:57.567
<i>an eye out for your old man
in case he pulls any...</i>

00:57.570 --> 00:59.970
<i>Sneak attacks.</i>

00:59.971 --> 01:02.303
<i>Don't be a wiener dog.
Jake, you coming?</i>

01:02.304 --> 01:06.072
<i>Whoo! Yeah, baby!</i>

01:06.073 --> 01:09.441
<i>All right, so... This is
the nightosphere, I guess.</i>

01:09.442 --> 01:12.841
<i>It looks banaynays. Marceline
says they got tons of</i>

01:12.842 --> 01:15.341
<i>crazy ways out here.</i>

01:15.343 --> 01:16.710
<i>Right, marceline?</i>

01:16.711 --> 01:23.312
<i>Marceline! Marcy!</i>

01:23.313 --> 01:26.013
<i>There you are, marceline.</i>

01:26.014 --> 01:27.480
<i>Hmm?</i>

01:27.481 --> 01:29.179
<i>- Rrragh!
- Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!</i>

01:29.182 --> 01:33.249
<i>- Oh. Hello, dog. Hello, finn.
- Stay away from me,</i>

01:33.250 --> 01:35.350
<i>old man!</i>

01:35.351 --> 01:38.717
<i>Nice one. Now, finn.</i>

01:38.720 --> 01:40.684
<i>Come on, there's no bad blood</i>

01:40.687 --> 01:41.784
<i>here. Come here.</i>

01:41.787 --> 01:44.785
<i>Let's bury the hatchet. See
how I'm not killing you?</i>

01:44.788 --> 01:47.220
<i>Dad, stop.</i>

01:47.221 --> 01:49.388
<i>All right. I don't
want to embarrass my</i>

01:49.389 --> 01:51.788
<i>little girl. So,
young lady, have you</i>

01:51.789 --> 01:53.889
<i>thought about my offer? Ugh!</i>

01:53.891 --> 01:55.756
<i>What offer, marceline's dad?</i>

01:55.759 --> 01:58.758
<i>I want marceline to take over</i>

01:58.759 --> 02:02.559
<i>the nightosphere... finally
join the family business.</i>

02:02.562 --> 02:05.659
<i>Business? Dad, what
do you even do?</i>

02:05.662 --> 02:07.729
<i>Oh! Ha! Come on, come
on, come on, come</i>

02:07.731 --> 02:10.995
<i>on. Check it out, sweetie.</i>

02:10.997 --> 02:13.163
<i>See how chaotic it is out there?</i>

02:13.164 --> 02:16.465
<i>How everyone's confused and</i>

02:16.466 --> 02:19.000
<i>frustrated? The
nightosphere is sustained</i>

02:19.001 --> 02:24.735
<i>by chaos. Eh, I just
don't see myself</i>

02:24.736 --> 02:27.869
<i>doing this biz. Okay,
but I know you'll come</i>

02:27.870 --> 02:30.168
<i>around eventually.
Or maybe you won't.</i>

02:30.170 --> 02:32.336
<i>I don't know. You're
an independent woman.</i>

02:32.338 --> 02:34.572
<i>Aaah!</i>

02:34.573 --> 02:39.907
<i>Well, I'm gonna take a nappy.
Oh! I almost forgot.</i>

02:39.908 --> 02:41.408
<i>Dad!</i>

02:41.409 --> 02:43.641
<i>Whoops!</i>

02:43.644 --> 02:46.942
<i>You should put this amulet on.
It'll Grant you wishes for,</i>

02:46.943 --> 02:49.442
<i>like, ponies... or
whatever kids like.</i>

02:49.445 --> 02:53.312
<i>Dad, I'm 1,000 years old. Ha!
Yes, you are, sweetie.</i>

02:53.313 --> 02:56.279
<i>Daddy's little monster.</i>

02:56.282 --> 02:59.481
<i>Look, let's just play
something, okay?</i>

02:59.482 --> 03:02.881
<i>Okay. ♪ I know you just want to</i>

03:02.884 --> 03:04.917
<i>give your little
girl the world ♪</i>

03:04.918 --> 03:07.817
<i>♪ but, daddy, I'm not
just your little girl ♪</i>

03:07.818 --> 03:10.317

03:13.288 --> 03:16.754

03:20.957 --> 03:27.091
<i>Pffft! Whatever, dad.</i>

03:27.092 --> 03:29.225
<i>Ooh... aaaaaaarrgh!</i>

03:30.793 --> 03:32.960
<i>Jake, grab the amulet! Oof!</i>

03:32.961 --> 03:37.595
<i>Ow! My hippocampus!</i>

03:37.596 --> 03:40.629
Well, that explains how

03:40.630 --> 03:43.029
we got amnesia'ed. But
what about banana?

03:43.032 --> 03:45.497
Hey, man, there's another video.

03:49.134 --> 03:52.000
<i>We got mad prison-overcrowding
down here, fellas.</i>

03:52.001 --> 03:54.534
<i>So, I got to put you in
the cage with the stuff.</i>

03:54.537 --> 03:56.835
<i>Sorry about that. But,
you know, not really.</i>

03:59.072 --> 04:02.703
<i>Oh, my stomach!</i>

04:07.674 --> 04:10.206
- Yeeeee!
- That amulet's

04:10.207 --> 04:15.308
controlling marceline! We
have to go back and help her!

04:15.311 --> 04:20.410
We're gonna get back using
that one portal spell we know.

04:20.413 --> 04:25.545
Hah! Maloso vobiscum
et cum spiritum!

04:25.548 --> 04:29.047
Whoa, dude. She told
us never to come back.

04:29.048 --> 04:32.847
Oh, yeah. Oh!

04:32.850 --> 04:35.115
Jake, can you turn
into a gross demon?

04:35.118 --> 04:39.484
Mm-hmm. - Grosser!

04:39.485 --> 04:42.485
- Raaaaaah!
- What's your

04:42.486 --> 04:45.687
- disguise?
Paper-plate mask, yo!

04:45.689 --> 04:47.955
- Nice!

04:47.957 --> 04:49.855
Let's go! Hyah!

04:52.756 --> 04:59.658
Who's next? Who's next? Uh...
Me, my lord aberdeer.

04:59.660 --> 05:05.461
What do you desire, cowering speck...
pain, pleasure, or

05:05.462 --> 05:09.761
weird punishment?
Uh... Pleasure?

05:09.764 --> 05:13.463
No! Weird punishment!

05:13.466 --> 05:20.700
<i>And what do you desire...</i>

05:20.702 --> 05:24.534
"p," "p," or "w.P."? I...

05:24.537 --> 05:28.936
Pain? Okay.

05:28.937 --> 05:32.571
Aw. Come on! Come on! Next!

05:32.572 --> 05:35.471
I'm just gonna go.
You sure, dude?

05:35.474 --> 05:40.908
Don't you want abs?
Yeah, give me abs.

05:40.909 --> 05:43.140
I think we can charge

05:43.143 --> 05:46.509
up there and rip the
amulet off her neck.

05:49.812 --> 05:54.045
Hey! What are you guys doing?!
You can't run up to the front of

05:54.047 --> 05:56.280
the line! These good
people have been

05:56.282 --> 05:58.614
waiting forever!
Shame on you both!

05:58.617 --> 06:01.915
Everybody, shame them!

06:01.917 --> 06:04.315
Boo, sir! I boo
what you're doing!

06:04.318 --> 06:09.251
Step back... back! You will
not cut the line again!

06:09.253 --> 06:14.820
You stay back here and wait
your turn like the rest of us!

06:14.822 --> 06:18.054
- Understand?!
- Yeah, okay! Okay!

06:18.056 --> 06:21.889
I'll be watching you.
Sorry, dude.

06:21.890 --> 06:24.889
You got out of line. Dang it!

06:32.062 --> 06:34.526
- Who are you?!
- Waah!

06:34.529 --> 06:36.061
- Don't kill us, marceline!
- It's us...

06:36.062 --> 06:37.361
- Finn and Jake!
- Your friends,

06:37.363 --> 06:40.463
remember?! Eh.

06:40.465 --> 06:43.296
Oh, grob!

06:43.299 --> 06:45.364
Aaaaaah!

06:48.466 --> 06:50.466
Run!

06:57.602 --> 07:03.671
Marceline. What are you doing?

07:03.674 --> 07:06.840
Just grabbing a midnight snack.

07:06.841 --> 07:09.174
It's marceline.
That's her out there!

07:09.176 --> 07:11.374
I know. Isn't it fantastic?

07:11.377 --> 07:13.743
No! We have to save her!

07:13.745 --> 07:15.976
- Save her?
- From the amulet!

07:15.977 --> 07:19.342
But this is what I've always wanted...
my girl following in

07:19.344 --> 07:22.212
<i>- her daddy's footsteps.
- But that's not what she</i>

07:22.214 --> 07:24.512
wants! That's balderdash, baby.

07:24.514 --> 07:28.113
The wearer of the amulet is
filled with chaotic evil, which

07:28.116 --> 07:32.514
is how I grew up, so...

07:37.884 --> 07:40.386
Maybe we can get these
dudes to help us.

07:44.522 --> 07:46.553
These guys won't help you.

07:46.554 --> 07:53.224
They're all complacent sheeple.

07:53.226 --> 07:56.290
Wait. That's it! We're
gonna freestyle a

07:56.292 --> 07:59.592
political rap to get these guys
to rise out of their systemized

07:59.594 --> 08:01.892
- demon apathy!
- Okay.

08:01.895 --> 08:06.395
Yeah. Unh.

08:06.397 --> 08:09.294
Political rap! Yo, yo!

08:09.296 --> 08:11.897
Demon apathy! Yo, zappity!

08:11.899 --> 08:14.197
Get ready! Government!

08:14.198 --> 08:17.533
Where you went! Yo!
Farmer's market!

08:17.534 --> 08:21.668
Ride bikes! Get on it!
Geodesic domes!

08:21.669 --> 08:24.068
Science! You heard?

08:24.070 --> 08:28.636
I never thought of it that

08:28.638 --> 08:32.072
way before. This
system is broke, yo!

Marceline.

08:51.714 --> 08:59.281
Ugh. Sick.

08:59.283 --> 09:01.982
- Jake! The tree house!
- Aaaah!

09:01.984 --> 09:03.850
I'm too freaked out
to move, finn!

09:03.851 --> 09:08.351
These demons are
nibbling my legs!

09:08.353 --> 09:11.451
- Jake, take her!
- No, finn!

09:11.454 --> 09:17.722
You'll be filled
with chaotic evil!

09:17.724 --> 09:25.257
Aaaaah!

09:36.697 --> 09:43.130
Marceline. No one leaves
the nightosphere!

09:43.131 --> 09:50.733
Wh-o-o-o-oa!

09:50.735 --> 09:54.436
Oh! Marceline!

09:54.437 --> 09:56.401
Uh, I wonder what
happened to him.

09:56.403 --> 09:59.170
Kids these days. Am I right?

09:59.172 --> 10:03.706
Dude. Seriously.
Dad, you tricked me.

10:06.040 --> 10:09.840
Dad, that sucks! I know.
I'm sorry.

10:09.841 --> 10:13.141
But I thought you'd want to...
Want to make your old man proud

10:13.143 --> 10:15.508
and, you know, take
over the nightosphere.

10:15.511 --> 10:20.011
<i>Yeah, I want you to be proud!
I want you to be proud of me!</i>

10:20.013 --> 10:24.080
No, I didn't mean... Baby,
of course I'm proud of

10:24.082 --> 10:25.412
you. Dad.

10:25.415 --> 10:28.147
And your friends,
they're all right!

10:28.149 --> 10:30.948
That political rap?
Pretty great!

10:30.950 --> 10:34.216
Okay, okay. I got
to go now, dad.

10:34.217 --> 10:39.284
Woof! What a nightmare. Man,
finn, my dad actually likes

10:39.286 --> 10:40.585
you.

10:40.588 --> 10:42.852
I don't want to hang out with

10:42.854 --> 10:45.021
- you anymore.
