00:05.036 --> 00:06.714
Previously on E.R.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.888
- Paul Sobriki?
- Yeah.

00:11.294 --> 00:12.995
- Hold him!
- ¡What are you doing to me!

00:13.030 --> 00:13.892
- ¡Carter!
- No now, Lucy.

00:13.897 --> 00:17.416
Paul Sobriki? He doesn't have a CNS
infection. I think he might be schizophrenic.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.579
Somebody!

00:37.605 --> 00:39.265
Lucy!

00:41.551 --> 00:44.421
E.R. 6x14 "ALL IN THE FAMILY"

00:49.350 --> 00:51.556
Dr Weaver you better hurry up!
You're gonna miss the party!

00:51.769 --> 00:52.848
What?

00:57.024 --> 00:59.147
- Dr. Weaver.
- Cleo! You're off?

00:59.360 --> 01:02.029
Dr. Kovac gave me 15 to grab
my dry-cleaning before closes.

01:02.196 --> 01:04.402
- We're slow, I take it?
- We are now.

01:04.515 --> 01:06.406
What's that music?

01:09.745 --> 01:12.532
- Looks like nail polish.
- It's buffed!

01:12.748 --> 01:14.539
You got a manicure, Malik?

01:14.708 --> 01:17.378
The ladies check out
your hands first.

01:17.586 --> 01:19.911
I check out the butt, myself.

01:20.130 --> 01:22.917
- That's a myth. I tested it.
- Tested what?

01:23.133 --> 01:25.090
It's so not worth explaining.

01:25.302 --> 01:29.002
- Kerry, happy Valentine's Day.
- It's a little loud!

01:29.222 --> 01:30.717
Sorry!

01:31.933 --> 01:33.392
What are you doing?

01:34.353 --> 01:36.511
Oh. Hi, chief. You on?

01:36.730 --> 01:39.185
Someone went overboard
with the hearts.

01:39.399 --> 01:40.430
What's wrong with them?

01:40.650 --> 01:43.485
- Want some pizza?
- No. Isn't Mark still on?

01:43.695 --> 01:45.320
He left at 8. Double date.

01:45.530 --> 01:48.068
I'm on till 9. Mighty fine.

01:48.283 --> 01:50.952
We slowed down.
No one's waiting to be seen.

01:51.161 --> 01:53.402
I took over the board.

01:53.580 --> 01:58.242
Okay. Another five minutes
and then back to work, all right?

02:01.796 --> 02:05.746
I'm sorry, Mrs. Minear,
it was a mistake. It won't-

02:05.967 --> 02:08.719
I was expecting some money, and it-

02:09.262 --> 02:13.342
I was expecting a check to clear,
and it didn't. I promise-

02:14.892 --> 02:20.598
I promise I'll get it to you. Thanks.
Teach me to check my messages.

02:20.773 --> 02:23.098
- Everything okay?
- No.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.606
- But it'll work out.
- I'm beat.

02:25.778 --> 02:26.809
You're leaving?

02:27.029 --> 02:31.940
I've been here since 7. I just want
to go home and hug my girls.

02:32.451 --> 02:35.156
- Lose a patient today?
- Yeah.

02:36.914 --> 02:38.823
Nice to have someone at home.

02:41.168 --> 02:44.584
- Alex and I broke up.
- I thought he was The Man.

02:44.797 --> 02:46.706
- Yeah, so did my neighbor.
- Ouch.

02:46.924 --> 02:50.293
- Luka, do have anyone to hand off?
- If you want.

02:50.469 --> 02:54.383
Ankle films are back on Cupid.
A Singing Telegram slipped.

02:54.598 --> 02:58.014
I need a doc in Radiology
for a patient named Rodriguez.

02:58.227 --> 03:00.303
- That's Carter's.
- Find Carter.

03:00.479 --> 03:03.515
- Can I have a bath?
- Let me look at your foot.

03:03.732 --> 03:06.353
- Pablo, you're alive?
- Yeah, I'm alive.

03:06.568 --> 03:09.320
- We haven't seen you.
- They put me on a bus.

03:09.529 --> 03:11.652
- What kind of a bus?
- A green one.

03:11.865 --> 03:14.534
- Where did it take you?
- I need a bath.

03:14.743 --> 03:17.115
I think Pablo got deported.

03:17.329 --> 03:19.405
- How'd he get back?
- That part's fuzzy.

03:19.623 --> 03:21.911
- It took a long time.
- Welcome back.

03:22.125 --> 03:23.667
Yeah, welcome back.

03:23.835 --> 03:27.121
Kerry, happy Valentine's Day-
Or night, I guess.

03:27.297 --> 03:28.328
Yeah, you too.

03:28.548 --> 03:31.039
- You know where Sobriki is?
- Who?

03:31.259 --> 03:35.257
- I got called down for a consult.
- I just got on. Check the board.

03:39.517 --> 03:44.677
- You must be Mr. Morris.
- How'd you guess? Is that my x-ray?

03:44.856 --> 03:47.429
Yep. Let's take a look.

03:49.402 --> 03:51.359
- Is the bone broken?
- Hold on.

03:52.071 --> 03:55.155
Gotta find another board.
I'll be right back.

03:55.366 --> 03:57.323
Could you talk to Toxicology?

03:57.535 --> 04:00.073
What's the problem?
"Bare Butt Booty Oil"?

04:00.287 --> 04:03.324
Kid drank it, isn't symptomatic
so they won't test it.

04:03.541 --> 04:05.866
- No ingredient list.
- "Bare Butt Booty Oil."

04:06.085 --> 04:08.706
- Okay, I'll talk to them.
- Thanks.

05:25.705 --> 05:30.331
- Is it just me, or are they dreadful?
- No, it's not just you.

05:55.484 --> 05:56.978
Surgery's on its way!

05:57.194 --> 06:00.064
- Spin a crit right away!
- Watch it on the right!

06:00.280 --> 06:02.273
No, I can't stay on the line!

06:02.491 --> 06:04.697
This guy could still be here!

06:04.910 --> 06:06.190
Get them here!

06:06.411 --> 06:08.238
John, can you hear me?

06:08.455 --> 06:11.456
- Airway looks clear.
- John, open your eyes.

06:11.625 --> 06:14.791
No response to command.
Glasgow coma-scale 7.

06:14.961 --> 06:17.168
- How long were they there?
- Long enough.

06:17.380 --> 06:20.215
- I can't believe no one noticed.
- Later.

06:20.425 --> 06:23.675
One, two, three. Push Etomidate
and sux now.

06:23.887 --> 06:28.513
Stab wounds to neck and chest.
Two more to the belly.

06:28.725 --> 06:30.682
Number 8 ET tube. What's her BP?

06:30.894 --> 06:34.726
- Pulse ox is low. 82.
- Get me a blood pressure!

06:34.939 --> 06:37.228
- Chest tube tray.
- No, start a central line.

06:37.442 --> 06:39.269
BP is 90/50.

06:39.485 --> 06:43.483
Four units of O-neg,
hang two on the rapid infuser.

06:45.033 --> 06:46.064
You okay?

06:48.202 --> 06:52.152
- I got it. Start the central line now.
- Betadine and a sterile drape.

06:52.373 --> 06:55.908
People are having parties while
they're bleeding to death.

07:00.214 --> 07:01.756
Two stab wounds to left flank.

07:01.966 --> 07:05.050
First one is at L-2,
4 centimeters off the midline.

07:05.261 --> 07:07.253
Second one is
in the mid-scapular line.

07:07.471 --> 07:10.258
- He hit the spinal cord?
- Depends on the angle.

07:10.474 --> 07:13.760
- BP's 70/50. Pulse, 120.
- Set me up for a subclavian.

07:13.978 --> 07:16.682
Good breath sounds bilaterally.
Pulse ox, 93.

07:16.897 --> 07:19.768
- Should we intubate?
- No. Ten liters by mask.

07:19.983 --> 07:24.112
Send a trauma panel, type and cross
for 4. Get X-ray for a chest.

07:24.321 --> 07:26.444
And one shot IVP.

07:26.657 --> 07:28.566
I was just talking to him.

07:31.078 --> 07:33.450
Right here. The patient's gone.

07:41.254 --> 07:42.535
What's his name?

07:42.756 --> 07:44.583
- Paul Sobriki.
- Who are you?

07:44.800 --> 07:47.966
Carl DeRaad, chief of psychiatry.

07:48.178 --> 07:50.301
- What's he look like?
- I hadn't seen him.

07:50.513 --> 07:51.889
- I'll get his chart.
- I will.

07:52.098 --> 07:54.138
This is a crime scene.

08:06.863 --> 08:08.654
It's okay. He's a doctor.

08:08.823 --> 08:10.365
- First crit is 31.
- Is he conscious?

08:11.326 --> 08:14.529
- Is he conscious?!
- No, but he is responding.

08:14.746 --> 08:16.987
It was a psych patient. Got Lucy too.

08:17.206 --> 08:19.958
Roll him, let me see. Oh, man!

08:20.126 --> 08:21.157
Pressure's up to 90.

08:21.377 --> 08:23.334
Why wasn't he in restraints?

08:23.504 --> 08:25.082
- Where's the Foley?
- That's next.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.498
- Pulse ox is 83.
- Give it a minute.

08:27.717 --> 08:30.172
The police are sealing off Curtain 3.

08:30.344 --> 08:33.594
They need someone who took
care of the patient.

08:34.056 --> 08:36.013
Look at this! Look at this!

08:36.225 --> 08:38.681
- Tracheal laceration.
- She needs a crike.

08:38.894 --> 08:44.184
No, a trach. Get Benton in here.
Prep the neck, open a Melker kit.

08:45.234 --> 08:46.313
- Dr. Benton!
- Hold on.

08:46.527 --> 08:50.904
No spinal injury. Hang the next
two units on the infuser.

08:51.115 --> 08:53.191
- It's not set up.
- Get it set up!

08:53.367 --> 08:55.573
Probably got the descending colon.

08:55.786 --> 08:59.155
Peter, Dr. Weaver needs you now.
She has to trach Lucy.

08:59.873 --> 09:04.037
- Book an O.R. Where's the Foley?
- I'm working on it.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.545
Clear the field of blood.
Hemostat!

09:10.384 --> 09:13.384
- Where's the infuser kit?
- It should be there.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.393
- They're not here!
- Well, try the top shelf.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.271
- What is it?
- A knife.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.279
Don't touch it. We got a weapon.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.115
- Any blood?
- Some.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.575
We were gonna use it to cut the cake.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.950
I have to go find some tubing.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.330
- Are you working on a victim?
- Yeah.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.092
- Will he make it?
- I don't know.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.418
- Is he awake?
- Got it!

09:57.680 --> 09:59.388
Second unit's in.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.434
- Pressure's up to 100.
- Give a gram of cefotetan.

10:02.601 --> 10:05.805
Right pupil is 5 mm and reactive.
Left is-

10:06.021 --> 10:07.302
John? John!

10:12.111 --> 10:14.816
- Deb?
- Do you know where you are?

10:17.283 --> 10:18.563
My back.

10:18.784 --> 10:21.109
You were stabbed. Your pressure's up.

10:21.286 --> 10:22.567
Lucy?

10:22.788 --> 10:24.448
Did you see the man who-?

10:24.623 --> 10:26.663
- Not now!
- It's better if I-

10:26.875 --> 10:28.583
You'll have to wait!

10:28.794 --> 10:30.122
- What?
- Nothing.

10:30.295 --> 10:31.790
He missed your spinal cord.

10:33.549 --> 10:34.580
BP's 80 palp.

10:38.470 --> 10:41.839
- Is that Lucy?
- Yes. She's alive.

10:42.724 --> 10:44.302
- Dr. Kovac.
- What?

10:44.768 --> 10:47.259
What? What is it?

10:48.522 --> 10:50.229
Get Benton. He needs to go up!

10:51.608 --> 10:53.399
Dr. Benton, we need you!

10:53.610 --> 10:55.353
Hook up the Thora-Seal!

10:55.570 --> 11:00.861
Dr. Benton, Carter's got a bad
renal lac. Foley output is bright red.

11:01.076 --> 11:02.653
Got another surgeon coming?

11:02.869 --> 11:06.653
We're outside! I'll be right there!

11:06.831 --> 11:09.287
Dad, wait for us inside.

11:11.586 --> 11:14.587
- Register in front.
- I'm a surgeon!

11:14.797 --> 11:18.166
- We don't have time for this!
- You must move your vehicle.

11:18.843 --> 11:20.836
- There!
- Okay, go ahead.

11:21.846 --> 11:24.419
Dad, I need you to move the van.

11:24.932 --> 11:28.017
- Where do I park it?
- You're asking me?

11:28.936 --> 11:32.021
You stay awake until you get up there.

11:32.189 --> 11:34.763
- FFP?
- Two units. Carter, stay with me!

11:34.984 --> 11:38.519
- How is he?
- We're red-lining him to the O.R.

11:38.738 --> 11:40.860
- A patient did this?
- Yeah.

11:41.031 --> 11:43.522
- What's his pressure?
- Kerry needs you.

11:43.701 --> 11:47.117
Carter! Look at me, right in the eye.

11:47.329 --> 11:48.788
Stay with me, man.

11:48.998 --> 11:52.413
- Xeroform and Elastoplast.
- Probably intra-abdominal bleed.

11:52.626 --> 11:55.247
- Why wasn't this guy sedated?
- I don't know.

11:55.462 --> 11:58.748
- Was there a sitter with him?
- I never saw him!

11:59.383 --> 12:03.463
- Where are we?
- Stab wounds to neck, chest, abdomen.

12:03.679 --> 12:06.680
- We had to trach her.
- And blood loss?

12:06.890 --> 12:10.306
400 here. Maybe another 2000
before we found her.

12:10.519 --> 12:12.926
Looks deep. How long was the blade?

12:13.522 --> 12:16.013
- Pressure's 60.
- She needs volume now.

12:16.233 --> 12:19.234
- It could be tamponade.
- No, wait! Check the CVP.

12:19.444 --> 12:21.484
- Lost her pulse!
- We're in P.E.A.

12:21.696 --> 12:23.772
Starting compressions.

12:23.990 --> 12:28.118
- We need to crack her. Prep her chest.
- Amp of epi. Sterile gloves.

12:28.328 --> 12:30.617
Stab wound is near the midline.

12:30.830 --> 12:33.582
- Sternal saw. Now, Lily.
- Go! Go! Go!

12:33.792 --> 12:35.950
- Ultrasound is ready.
- In a minute.

12:36.169 --> 12:38.494
Ten blade. Stand back.

12:39.005 --> 12:40.879
Sats are down to 85.

13:00.443 --> 13:04.440
- Almost got it. Okay.
- Rib spreader.

13:06.115 --> 13:07.395
Suction.

13:15.374 --> 13:17.201
- V-fib!
- Start internal compressions.

13:20.170 --> 13:22.080
There's an effusion.

13:23.966 --> 13:24.997
Metz.

13:25.384 --> 13:27.507
Prep the internal paddles.

13:27.720 --> 13:31.219
- We've got a major hemorrhage.
- Looks like the proximal aorta.

13:31.431 --> 13:35.014
I need a 4.0 prolene
on a n RB-1 needle now.

13:35.352 --> 13:37.345
Belly's full of blood.

13:37.563 --> 13:39.970
- Clamp the aorta.
- First things first.

13:40.148 --> 13:42.106
Autotransfuse from the cell saver.

13:42.317 --> 13:45.104
- Charge the paddles to 15.
- Cut! Cut!

13:46.279 --> 13:47.311
Clear!

13:49.741 --> 13:51.449
We're still in V-Fib.

13:51.660 --> 13:53.486
Another amp of EPI.

13:53.703 --> 13:55.363
Clear.

14:00.085 --> 14:01.662
- Sinus tach.
- Check pressure!

14:01.878 --> 14:04.665
We're moving her to the O.R. now.

14:04.881 --> 14:06.874
Pulse ox is up to 92.

14:07.091 --> 14:08.883
- Pressure's 90.
- Let's go!

14:10.512 --> 14:13.133
- Pulse ox cable!
- Is she making urine?

14:13.348 --> 14:16.432
- Only 50 cc's.
- That's better than nothing.

14:16.643 --> 14:19.098
Tell O.R. we have an open chest wound.

14:19.312 --> 14:22.348
- We're waiting on the type-specific.
- Have it sent up.

14:22.565 --> 14:25.898
- Are you putting her on bypass?
- Have a perfusionist.

14:26.694 --> 14:29.861
Don't bag so fast. We don't
want her alkalotic.

14:30.031 --> 14:32.356
- Need anyone else?
- I hope not.

14:32.533 --> 14:34.858
Don't forget the drug box. Go!

14:41.208 --> 14:42.786
I can't believe this.

14:44.837 --> 14:46.829
You think we got it in time?

14:47.548 --> 14:49.955
- She has a good chance.
- Kerry?

14:50.801 --> 14:53.043
You're the one who found them?

14:53.220 --> 14:55.711
We got a problem
with the Medevac chopper.

14:55.931 --> 14:57.674
- Try to divert.
- I did but-

14:57.891 --> 14:59.220
Whatever.

15:38.014 --> 15:40.766
Peter! I just heard.
What happened?

15:40.934 --> 15:43.769
This is O-neg.
I asked for type-specific.

15:43.937 --> 15:45.016
He is O-negative.

15:45.230 --> 15:47.851
I'll scrub in.
Hang in there, Dr. Carter!

15:50.151 --> 15:54.777
- How many units is that?
- Five, but you shouldn't be counting.

15:56.282 --> 15:58.109
It's bad, isn't it?

15:59.285 --> 16:02.985
Well, we're having problems
keeping your crit up.

16:03.205 --> 16:04.949
That's from the renal lac.

16:05.166 --> 16:08.914
I'm giving you Versed to relax you
before I intubate.

16:10.796 --> 16:14.296
- It could be the aorta.
- Or mesenteric vessels.

16:14.467 --> 16:15.795
Oh, God.

16:16.010 --> 16:21.170
Don't worry. I'll explore the abdomen
and check out everything, okay?

16:22.766 --> 16:24.474
I'm glad it's you.

16:24.977 --> 16:29.805
I'm getting you through this, man.
You hear me?

16:33.152 --> 16:34.978
Okay, ready to intubate.

16:35.195 --> 16:39.524
- I want to cut in 2 minutes. I mean it.
- You got it.

16:44.997 --> 16:47.950
- Lac to the proximal aorta.
- What happened?

16:48.166 --> 16:50.325
- We had to crack her.
- I got this.

16:50.544 --> 16:52.750
- Who's on anesthesia?
- I got her.

16:52.963 --> 16:56.166
Put her on the table supine.
Keep her chest covered.

17:12.648 --> 17:15.650
You need a six-inch
butcher knife to cut a cake?

17:15.859 --> 17:18.565
They just told me that's what we use.

17:18.780 --> 17:20.737
- We just leave it out?
- I didn't.

17:20.948 --> 17:24.992
- Was it in the lounge?
- I don't know. I couldn't find it.

17:25.203 --> 17:28.406
Go get Security to open up
the personnel office.

17:28.623 --> 17:30.911
I need contact numbers
for Carter and Lucy.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.698
I want you to bring the files down.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.375
- He presented with a headache.
- Who?

17:36.547 --> 17:39.548
Paul Sobriki. Please tell me
that you saw him.

17:39.717 --> 17:42.552
Yeah. Lucy worked him up,
Carter supervised.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.549
- Who supervised him?
- The LP came back negative.

17:45.723 --> 17:48.178
You could have rounded before leaving.

17:48.392 --> 17:51.227
- I ran the board with Dr. Kovac.
- For 30 seconds?

17:51.437 --> 17:54.354
- He was up to speed.
- You didn't say he was psychotic.

17:54.565 --> 17:56.937
I didn't know.
Did he present to you?

17:57.151 --> 18:01.896
- We wait on psych consults.
- Unless his status changes!

18:02.072 --> 18:05.940
- I was managing the whole board.
- You were having a party!

18:06.160 --> 18:09.244
We thought that Lucy
and Carter had it covered.

18:09.454 --> 18:11.661
- Well, they didn't.
- Excuse me.

18:11.873 --> 18:14.993
We use the Residents
to keep us informed.

18:15.210 --> 18:18.377
- You're blaming Carter?
- I'm not blaming anyone.

18:18.588 --> 18:22.752
I have Samantha Sobriki here.
She's looking for her husband.

18:24.261 --> 18:27.048
I got a message from Lucy Knight.

18:28.682 --> 18:32.929
She said to come down.
She didn't say what was wrong.

18:38.441 --> 18:39.983
You'd better come with me.

18:42.070 --> 18:45.604
That chopper's landing right now.
The Medevac from Whiting.

18:45.782 --> 18:48.533
Kerry, go and change. I'll take it.

18:48.993 --> 18:50.452
What happened?

18:50.662 --> 18:52.571
The air squad's here.

18:52.789 --> 18:55.493
- Was there a bomb scare?
- I wish.

18:58.628 --> 19:01.997
- It's not true. I want to see him.
- He's not here.

19:02.215 --> 19:04.540
Paul couldn't hurt anyone.

19:04.759 --> 19:07.878
- He needs help.
- There's been a mistake.

19:08.554 --> 19:11.804
We believe he may have schizophrenia.

19:13.517 --> 19:14.680
What?

19:15.603 --> 19:19.470
The first psychotic break can happen
in your 20s.

19:20.983 --> 19:23.521
You're wrong, okay? You're wrong.

19:28.699 --> 19:32.198
- The kidney won't tamponade.
- You couldn't get an IVP?

19:32.411 --> 19:34.736
I didn't want to chance it.

19:35.330 --> 19:39.410
The colon's lacerated, all right.
3.0 silk on a GI needle.

19:39.626 --> 19:42.746
There's blood welling in the hilum.

19:42.963 --> 19:45.668
Isolate the renal artery.
Get a clamp on it.

19:45.841 --> 19:49.423
- He's hypotensive.
- We gotta get this kidney out!

19:49.636 --> 19:52.672
Let me finish suturing
before we do something drastic.

19:52.848 --> 19:56.133
- I'll dissect out the arteries. Move!
- I said wait!

19:56.351 --> 19:59.020
He's lost too much blood.
His hilum's trashed.

19:59.187 --> 20:02.722
He's getting shocky.
Pressure's 78 palp.

20:02.941 --> 20:04.435
- We have time.
- We don't!

20:04.651 --> 20:07.189
Peter, calm down and listen to me!

20:07.404 --> 20:10.440
Let's check the source
of the bleeding once more.

20:10.657 --> 20:14.026
- Too many vessels are injured.
- Let's be sure.

20:19.040 --> 20:21.875
I can't identify the source
of the bleeding.

20:22.085 --> 20:26.663
- I'll pack off the liver.
- BP's 105/70.

20:26.881 --> 20:28.921
- Angled Potts now.
- What're you doing?

20:29.133 --> 20:31.885
Pringle maneuver.
Have to cut this blood loss.

20:32.261 --> 20:34.799
- The spleen's still bleeding.
- Okay.

20:35.014 --> 20:37.552
- BP's falling, 80/60.
- Run another unit.

20:37.767 --> 20:41.432
- She loses it as fast as we give it.
- Then quickly!

20:43.731 --> 20:48.274
A and O times 4.
BP, 132/82. Pulse 110.

20:48.486 --> 20:51.023
You sure there wasn't a projectile?

20:51.238 --> 20:53.776
Just oil. Must've been
a loose fitting.

20:53.991 --> 20:58.238
A small stream at that pressure will
cut through you like a. 22.

20:58.412 --> 21:00.239
- Hey, Dad.
- What's going on?

21:00.456 --> 21:05.367
Get a trauma panel. Type and cross
for 4, I'll be there in a minute.

21:05.586 --> 21:08.919
- A couple of our staff were hurt.
- I heard. Who's that?

21:09.131 --> 21:11.420
I'm covering.
Things are off-balance.

21:11.633 --> 21:14.420
- Where's Elizabeth?
- She's up in Surgery.

21:14.636 --> 21:18.219
An MVA's coming, auto vs. pedestrian,
in five minutes.

21:18.432 --> 21:21.136
Grab Chen and Malucci.
Weaver should be around.

21:21.351 --> 21:25.894
- What do I do with her mother?
- I'll drive you home in a half-hour.

21:26.106 --> 21:27.683
- Will they be okay?
- Who?

21:27.899 --> 21:30.271
- Your friends.
- I don't know, Dad.

21:30.485 --> 21:33.605
You're acting like you know
he did it. You don't.

21:33.822 --> 21:36.823
You're right. But we still
need to find him.

21:37.033 --> 21:40.283
He's not at home.
Nobody's seen him at the diner.

21:40.495 --> 21:43.116
Is there any other place
he would feel safe?

21:43.289 --> 21:46.658
He was depressed.
It doesn't make him crazy.

21:46.876 --> 21:52.119
Maybe. But we have to assume he could
be a danger to himself or others.

21:52.674 --> 21:56.374
If he was dangerous, why did
they leave him alone?

21:59.764 --> 22:03.631
I understand. This doesn't
make sense to any of us.

22:03.809 --> 22:06.810
But if Paul is in trouble,
he needs help.

22:06.979 --> 22:09.814
And it's better if we can
find him now.

22:17.031 --> 22:20.115
Sometimes he goes to the roof
to be alone.

22:20.326 --> 22:22.995
- The roof?
- Of our apartment building.

22:25.331 --> 22:27.122
He didn't do this.

22:27.333 --> 22:29.456
Bleeding's under control.

22:29.668 --> 22:30.997
Pean clamp.

22:31.670 --> 22:33.663
- Watch the pancreas.
- Hold on.

22:33.839 --> 22:36.674
I'll enlarge the incision
in the peritoneum.

22:36.842 --> 22:39.000
Watch for splenic flexure.

22:40.053 --> 22:43.339
- Got it. I'll clamp, you cut.
- Metz.

22:48.228 --> 22:50.517
Bastard sliced the hell
out of it.

22:50.689 --> 22:53.939
It's senseless
to cut up this poor girl.

22:54.151 --> 22:56.523
It's better than the alternative.

22:56.862 --> 23:00.990
Let the renal artery flush retrograde
before closing the defect.

23:01.199 --> 23:03.358
There. Think we got it?

23:03.577 --> 23:08.404
There's one way to know. Release
the clamp, let the kidney perfuse.

23:08.623 --> 23:11.873
Okay. Go ahead.

23:16.714 --> 23:18.173
No bleeding.

23:19.217 --> 23:23.464
Hilum's intact. And the kidney
is pinking up.

23:23.680 --> 23:27.380
All right, we did it.
You were right. Thanks.

23:29.102 --> 23:32.221
He could've lived without a kidney.

23:32.438 --> 23:34.265
Pressure's still down, 80/62.

23:34.482 --> 23:36.973
- We caught up on volume?
- Almost.

23:37.193 --> 23:39.600
Why is he still hypotensive?

23:39.820 --> 23:43.604
There's swelling in the periaortic
area. A hematoma's forming.

23:43.824 --> 23:45.817
- From the lumbar artery?
- I hope.

23:46.035 --> 23:49.404
- It could paralyze him!
- It's better than his aorta.

23:50.122 --> 23:52.031
Dissect down to the artery.

23:56.462 --> 23:59.581
- Some kind of life.
- I hope this isn't normal.

23:59.757 --> 24:02.248
No, I don't think so.

24:03.719 --> 24:06.673
You've got quite a girl there
in Elizabeth.

24:06.889 --> 24:10.258
I can't take the credit.
The boarding school raised her.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.597
I was teasing.

24:21.194 --> 24:25.903
- Her father passed on?
- He was alive, the last I heard.

24:28.326 --> 24:31.280
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. It wasn't your fault.

24:32.289 --> 24:34.780
- Have you heard anything?
- They're in the O.R.

24:34.958 --> 24:39.419
- Think we should go up?
- They'll call when everything's okay.

24:40.964 --> 24:43.799
- What have you got?
- John Doe hit by a van.

24:43.967 --> 24:47.466
- No head trauma, repeated questions.
- I called a cab!

24:47.679 --> 24:49.967
- I think we got a looney-toon.
- Why?

24:50.139 --> 24:53.224
He was running around naked
in the freezing cold.

24:54.310 --> 24:55.804
You can't do this!

24:55.979 --> 24:57.971
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, it's him!

24:58.147 --> 25:00.638
Trauma panel, C-spine,
chest and pelvis.

25:00.858 --> 25:04.642
- Is he combative?
- I'm not taking any chances.

25:04.862 --> 25:07.947
- Get the police detective in here!
- Get X-ray.

25:08.157 --> 25:12.071
- Abdomen is soft, non-tender.
- I won't talk! I made promises!

25:12.286 --> 25:13.864
Pupils equal and reactive.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.653
- Paul, do you know where you are?
- Who told you my name?!

25:16.874 --> 25:21.417
- Paul, do you remember what happened?
- You can't trick me!

25:21.629 --> 25:23.420
- No deformity.
- I'm not deformed!

25:23.631 --> 25:25.006
Temperature's 95-

25:26.467 --> 25:30.334
Get off of me! Leave me alone.
Don't stick me.

25:30.554 --> 25:32.179
You want some Haldol?

25:32.431 --> 25:35.136
Dr. Weaver, do you want some Haldol?

25:37.102 --> 25:39.854
Two liters of saline
and five of Haldol.

25:40.022 --> 25:42.228
Where are you going?

25:42.441 --> 25:44.517
- Can you take this patient?
- You okay?

25:44.735 --> 25:48.483
He's the guy. He's the psych patient.
He got hit by a car.

25:48.697 --> 25:49.860
Can you just take him?

25:50.073 --> 25:51.532
- Okay.
- Thank you.

25:51.992 --> 25:53.866
BP 120/82 after a liter.

25:54.077 --> 25:56.747
Probably venous oozing.
Can you take him?

25:56.955 --> 25:59.031
- Who's our surgeon?
- Whoever's free.

25:59.958 --> 26:02.366
He has a chest tube and head CT.

26:02.586 --> 26:04.377
I don't want you to touch me!

26:04.546 --> 26:06.289
Stop sticking me!

26:07.215 --> 26:10.382
- Let me go!
- Keep that mask on him!

26:10.593 --> 26:13.547
Don't cut me! Don't cut me! No!

26:23.731 --> 26:26.057
Hell of a Valentine's Day.

26:26.234 --> 26:28.807
She's satting at 98 on 30% oxygen.

26:29.028 --> 26:32.397
Can't ask for better than that.
Good work.

26:34.700 --> 26:36.360
How's Carter?

26:37.495 --> 26:40.200
Took a while to control the bleeding.

26:40.414 --> 26:43.119
They saved his kidney
and are doing a colostomy.

26:44.043 --> 26:45.241
Unbelievable.

26:46.045 --> 26:49.580
County supervisor's on the phone.
He heard what happened.

26:49.757 --> 26:52.758
- Tell him I'm in surgery.
- I told him you got out.

26:53.219 --> 26:54.547
Thank you.

26:54.929 --> 26:56.589
Appreciate that.

26:57.681 --> 26:59.259
I'll be right back.

27:01.393 --> 27:03.433
Dr. Corday, she's waking up.

27:08.859 --> 27:10.022
Lucy...

27:10.611 --> 27:12.437
Lucy, can you hear me?

27:13.864 --> 27:15.940
Do you know what happened?

27:18.410 --> 27:23.119
There's several stab wounds.
One lacerated your proximal aorta.

27:23.290 --> 27:26.623
We performed a thoracotomy
after you arrested.

27:27.210 --> 27:31.457
They gave you a trach
to maintain your airway.

27:31.673 --> 27:36.382
Your liver was damaged,
but we were able to repair it.

27:36.595 --> 27:39.512
However, we removed your spleen.

27:41.641 --> 27:43.052
I'm sorry.

27:46.855 --> 27:48.183
You can't speak.

27:51.818 --> 27:55.815
You can whisper if I plug the trach.
Want to try?

28:00.868 --> 28:02.695
Remember, only whisper.

28:06.958 --> 28:08.333
Thank you.

28:17.551 --> 28:21.003
Bring the proximal colon
to skin surface.

28:21.847 --> 28:26.675
- Hanging in there? You look ragged.
- I'm fine. Metz.

28:27.520 --> 28:31.138
I think young Dr. Carter
is very fortunate.

28:31.357 --> 28:33.017
Depends on how you see it.

28:33.192 --> 28:36.193
- We need a surgeon in O.R. 3.
- What is it?

28:36.362 --> 28:39.279
Penetrating trauma.
Something about oil.

28:39.490 --> 28:41.399
- Where's Corday?
- Should I page her?

28:41.617 --> 28:44.534
- We're busy.
- Take a look. I can finish.

28:44.703 --> 28:47.538
I've come this far.
Is the patient stable?

28:47.748 --> 28:49.206
- Who's with the patient?
- Dr. Finch.

28:49.416 --> 28:51.658
Have her stay until Corday shows.

28:57.424 --> 29:00.460
They need me in the O.R. I'll be back.

29:02.012 --> 29:04.550
Hold on. Her sat's down to 82.

29:04.764 --> 29:07.801
What is it? Chest pain?
Sudden onset.

29:08.018 --> 29:11.303
Put her at 100%.
We must do a spiral CT now.

29:11.521 --> 29:13.644
PE is a possibility.

29:13.857 --> 29:15.766
- What is it?
- Sudden chest pain.

29:15.984 --> 29:18.653
Dropped her sats.
We'll scan for a PE.

29:18.862 --> 29:21.862
Bolus 5000 heparin.
Start a drip, 1000 an hour.

29:22.073 --> 29:24.694
Hold on. Keep going. Come here.

29:24.909 --> 29:26.902
Don't thin her blood if
we don't have to.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.744
I think she threw a massive clot.

29:28.955 --> 29:31.660
We don't want her to bleed out.

29:31.874 --> 29:36.287
If it's PE and we don't thin her
blood, she'll throw another clot.

29:36.504 --> 29:39.505
We won't heparinize
for more than two hours.

29:39.715 --> 29:41.625
- I won't need that long.
- Let's go.

29:45.721 --> 29:47.761
Were you working on my husband?

29:47.974 --> 29:51.556
He was hit by a car. Collapsed lung,
but we fixed it.

29:52.044 --> 29:53.441
No head trauma.

29:53.476 --> 29:56.430
- He's with the psychiatrist now.
- Can I see him?

29:57.650 --> 30:02.525
You should wait a minute.
We gave him a drug to calm him down.

30:03.030 --> 30:04.821
I really need to see him.

30:06.742 --> 30:08.153
Right pulmonary artery.

30:08.369 --> 30:12.865
Get her into angiography. I'll meet
you there. Get the room ready.

30:13.081 --> 30:15.833
Chest and abdominal dressings
soaked through.

30:16.043 --> 30:19.044
Watch her BP.
Send her for a hematocrit.

30:19.254 --> 30:22.006
There's some oozing from the incision.

30:22.215 --> 30:27.127
Happens with heparin. Blood pressure's
fine. No major hemorrhage.

30:27.345 --> 30:29.836
CT shows a pulmonary embolism.

30:30.056 --> 30:34.006
We'll take you to Angiography
and put in a filter.

30:34.227 --> 30:38.640
We'll reverse the heparin.
You may need another transfusion.

30:40.525 --> 30:42.518
Lucy, are you with me?

30:47.282 --> 30:49.607
I'll get you through this.
All right?

30:53.955 --> 30:54.986
All right.

31:01.254 --> 31:03.045
- Want anything?
- Coffee.

31:03.256 --> 31:05.083
Two coffees, please.

31:06.592 --> 31:09.379
- You didn't want to go home either?
- Yeah. Sit down.

31:09.595 --> 31:13.545
We thought it was better than
waiting upstairs.

31:13.766 --> 31:16.684
- Pretty scary, huh?
- Pretty scary.

31:17.520 --> 31:20.521
I was complaining about my day.

31:20.690 --> 31:23.359
BP's 112/78.
Pulse 102.

31:23.526 --> 31:27.855
AC 14, tidal volume 600,
100% Fl-O2.

31:28.072 --> 31:32.899
Another two of Versed.
To relax you a bit during procedure.

31:34.995 --> 31:36.454
Want to stay awake?

31:38.874 --> 31:43.500
I'll numb the inguinal area and put
a catheter in the femoral vein.

31:43.712 --> 31:45.918
- I'll prep.
- Spun crit's 32.

31:46.131 --> 31:49.085
- Good. Go.
- I'll be right back, Lucy.

31:52.387 --> 31:56.599
We put too much time and energy
into your training to lose you.

31:58.477 --> 32:01.846
Filters are a snap.
I've done 100 of them.

32:02.063 --> 32:04.139
I'll talk you through it.

32:07.736 --> 32:10.571
BP's down to 60. Pulse ox 72.

32:11.573 --> 32:14.858
- No carotid pulse.
- She threw a clot.

32:16.661 --> 32:18.737
Start chest compressions.

32:18.913 --> 32:22.958
Bag her! Lizzie, I need you!
Get me a staple remover!

32:23.168 --> 32:25.374
Throw some betadine on the chest.

32:26.588 --> 32:28.794
- You're opening her?
- She won't make it to O.R.

32:29.007 --> 32:30.584
We need two more nurses.

32:30.758 --> 32:33.249
- What happened?
- She's in PEA. Get wire cutters.

32:33.469 --> 32:36.672
- Wire cutters?
- We wired the breastbone.

32:37.223 --> 32:38.503
- Corday's tied up.
- Why?

32:38.724 --> 32:41.097
- She's in CT.
- Can you take it?

32:41.269 --> 32:43.226
- I'm suturing.
- I gotta run the bowel.

32:43.437 --> 32:47.684
He needs an exp-lap. Go.
I'll page you if anything changes.

32:50.945 --> 32:53.732
- Vitals?
- BP's 125/85. Pulse 92.

32:53.906 --> 32:54.937
- Crit?
-42.

32:55.116 --> 32:58.781
Prep for an exp-lap.
Stay here until the surgeon comes.

32:58.953 --> 33:01.657
- You can't stay?
- I'm operating on Carter.

33:01.872 --> 33:04.031
Start internal compressions.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.954
- Right ventricle's dilated.
- Side clamp.

33:07.169 --> 33:11.665
- Want a fogarty?
- No, just a yankauer. Scalpel.

33:13.008 --> 33:15.464
- We'll suck out what we can.
- Suction.

33:21.850 --> 33:23.724
- Right side.
- We've got a few clots.

33:23.936 --> 33:25.975
Maybe she'll get some oxygen.

33:26.188 --> 33:28.809
- Pressure's dropping.
- He can't wait. Where are they?

33:29.024 --> 33:31.063
Probably tore a mesenteric artery.

33:31.276 --> 33:33.814
Lost the pulse. Starting compressions.

33:34.029 --> 33:35.143
Betadine!

33:35.322 --> 33:37.480
- What are you doing?
- Thoracotomy tray.

33:37.699 --> 33:40.949
- He only needs a laparotomy.
- I don't know how to do that.

33:41.161 --> 33:43.153
You can't operate here.
Wait for the surgeon.

33:43.371 --> 33:47.416
He can take over.
Get me a scalpel! Get Benton!

33:48.334 --> 33:50.410
- Pulse ox?
-68 on 100%.

33:50.628 --> 33:53.713
- We're not oxygenating.
- Removing side clamp.

33:53.923 --> 33:56.331
- V-fib! Resuming compressions.
- Internal paddles.

33:56.509 --> 33:58.336
Charge to 15.

33:59.095 --> 34:00.423
Clear!

34:01.014 --> 34:02.674
Still in v-fib.

34:02.890 --> 34:04.598
- Charge to 30.
- Push an amp of epi.

34:04.809 --> 34:06.054
Clear.

34:06.728 --> 34:08.850
- Nothing.
- Again.

34:09.063 --> 34:10.344
Clear.

34:10.940 --> 34:15.068
- Sat down to 62.
- Charge again. 100 of lidocaine.

34:15.277 --> 34:16.558
Clear.

34:19.282 --> 34:21.570
Again. Clear.

34:22.034 --> 34:24.525
- What are you doing?
- Saving his life.

34:24.745 --> 34:27.699
- He needed a laparotomy.
- You should've been here.

34:27.873 --> 34:30.495
- Should've called me.
- Aorta's cross-clamped.

34:30.918 --> 34:33.326
This was unnecessary.
What were you thinking?

34:33.545 --> 34:37.164
- There was no pressure. Now there is.
- I've got it.

34:37.382 --> 34:41.250
- He was about to arrest.
- Step the hell back now!

34:41.469 --> 34:44.803
- Pulse is down to 90.
- Move, people.

34:45.014 --> 34:49.891
- I'm sorry Carter's hurt-
- Irrigate the chest with warm saline.

34:50.062 --> 34:51.141
Clear!

34:51.355 --> 34:53.264
- Asystole.
- Amp of atropine.

34:53.482 --> 34:55.106
- When was the last epi?
- Four minutes ago.

34:55.317 --> 34:58.484
Push another 7 mg now! Clear!

35:05.911 --> 35:08.236
We've done everything we can.

35:11.750 --> 35:13.374
Holding compressions.

35:23.970 --> 35:25.429
Damn it.

35:33.771 --> 35:35.100
Son of a bitch!

35:41.821 --> 35:45.605
Give a minute for the last epi
to circulate. Charge.

35:46.784 --> 35:49.405
- Lizzie, let's go!
- Robert...

36:06.762 --> 36:07.793
Call it.

36:11.684 --> 36:14.850
Time of death 2:56.

36:30.077 --> 36:31.785
When can I go home?

36:32.954 --> 36:34.152
I don't know.

36:34.331 --> 36:38.459
I want to go home.
I need to feed my dog.

36:38.752 --> 36:42.251
Paul, we have someone
here to see you.

36:42.464 --> 36:44.088
- Paul.
- Sam.

36:50.013 --> 36:51.424
I want to go home.

36:51.639 --> 36:55.388
- What happened?
- They took my clothes. My shoes.

36:55.602 --> 36:57.974
- Who took your clothes?
- Them.

36:58.188 --> 36:59.646
Who's them?

37:00.481 --> 37:03.435
They had a blue cake.

37:03.651 --> 37:07.483
- Is that where you got the knife?
- They were gonna open me.

37:07.697 --> 37:10.864
- The knife?
- They were gonna take my organs.

37:11.075 --> 37:14.159
- What organs?
- My internal organs!

37:14.495 --> 37:18.160
Don't you understand?
I had to protect them!

37:18.624 --> 37:21.827
Don't try to tell me I don't know.
I know.

37:22.044 --> 37:25.994
They tried to take them.
I had to stop them!

37:34.974 --> 37:36.302
Is he ready?

37:37.518 --> 37:38.549
Yeah.

37:42.898 --> 37:47.809
- Do you want to take him upstairs?
- Can I please go home now?

38:03.251 --> 38:07.747
I'll meet you in recovery.
Is Carter out of the O.R.?

38:07.964 --> 38:12.673
He's extubated in recovery.
Vitals are stable.

38:16.097 --> 38:19.098
- Peter-
- You were right.

38:19.309 --> 38:22.144
I put you in a tough position.

38:23.938 --> 38:25.101
What's wrong?

38:27.650 --> 38:30.437
There was a complication with Lucy.

38:32.780 --> 38:37.276
- Not "Vanessa" Vanessa!
- The one and only. You know her?

38:37.452 --> 38:39.444
I saw her in medical school.

38:39.620 --> 38:42.456
She had abdominal pain.
Carter orders a pelvic.

38:42.957 --> 38:45.626
Tells Lucy the patient's more
comfortable with a woman.

38:45.793 --> 38:48.165
- Oh, man!
- Who's Vanessa?

38:48.379 --> 38:52.044
Lucy's official, polite.
She gets her tray...

38:52.258 --> 38:55.294
...puts on her gloves,
pulls back the curtain-

38:55.511 --> 38:58.084
- Carter's outside waiting.
- For what?

38:58.305 --> 39:00.678
- The scream.
- I don't get it.

39:00.891 --> 39:04.723
Carter sent her in to do a pelvic
on a drag queen.

39:04.937 --> 39:06.312
He did not!

39:07.856 --> 39:09.516
- Terrible.
- She didn't know?

39:09.733 --> 39:13.980
Hand it to Vanessa,
he's got a better figure than I do.

39:17.324 --> 39:18.653
What is it?

39:20.828 --> 39:22.156
Lucy.

39:34.966 --> 39:37.339
Tell me when the vibration stops.

39:37.594 --> 39:41.923
- What about the pancreas?
- Intact. He got the colon.

39:42.140 --> 39:46.138
- How long will I have the colostomy?
- A month. We'll do a take-down.

39:47.228 --> 39:48.509
Now.

39:49.731 --> 39:53.016
Good. Sensation's intact.

39:55.779 --> 39:58.614
- You were lucky.
- I know.

40:01.201 --> 40:02.860
Thank you.

40:04.120 --> 40:08.829
You're welcome. I'll test your
motor strength. Lift your leg.

40:11.294 --> 40:14.164
- How's Lucy doing?
- Come on. Lift.

40:18.926 --> 40:20.586
- That hurts.
- I know.

40:20.803 --> 40:23.175
Don't let me push it down.

40:23.389 --> 40:25.263
Hold it. Hold it.

40:28.269 --> 40:29.300
Good, good.

40:32.148 --> 40:34.473
- My back is killing me.
- I know.

40:34.692 --> 40:37.361
Hematoma on lumbar plexus.
I'll give you morphine.

40:37.570 --> 40:40.107
I want you walking in 12 hours.

40:47.913 --> 40:49.822
Lucy's dead, isn't she?

41:12.521 --> 41:14.928
Oh, you're home.

41:16.900 --> 41:18.727
Everything all right?

41:19.235 --> 41:20.860
No.

41:22.447 --> 41:27.358
- Do you want to tell me about it?
- Not particularly.

41:30.371 --> 41:32.198
I'll make breakfast.

42:01.444 --> 42:05.572
We need a pressure transducer for
Trauma. Get two units of O-neg.

42:05.781 --> 42:08.817
- We're out of Ancef.
- Call the pharmacy.

42:11.662 --> 42:16.158
I just heard. How did this happen?

42:16.959 --> 42:20.873
- Can we talk about it later?
- Sure.

42:24.424 --> 42:27.675
- Something coming in?
- Multi-victim trauma.

42:27.844 --> 42:30.845
Assembly-line accident.
We'll take 2 major, 6 minors.

42:31.014 --> 42:34.383
- ETA?
- Now, but we're short a doc.

42:34.601 --> 42:35.846
- Abby, you on?
- No.

42:36.061 --> 42:39.181
- We're short. Can you cover?
- Sure.

42:39.523 --> 42:42.192
We need someone to cover triage.

42:48.740 --> 42:51.934
42-year-old male.
Crush injury, right arm.

42:51.969 --> 42:55.654
Gave him morphine and two liters.
Shocky, 90/60.

42:55.872 --> 42:56.903
Neuro-circ intact?

42:57.123 --> 43:00.991
Couldn't get a pulse.
Multiple fractures.

43:01.211 --> 43:05.540
Call Ortho and Vascular. Type
and cross for four. Trauma 2.

43:17.226 --> 43:19.219
I had to close her chest.

43:31.824 --> 43:33.104
Thank you.

43:44.086 --> 43:47.170
- The nurses can do that.
- I know.
