12:36.046 --> 12:36.881
Arby's.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.508
Anywhere at all.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.468
Arby's.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.929
-Any place you want.
-Arby's.

12:45.723 --> 12:49.852
Hey, is there a chance that I could
get into Har-vard or Dart-mouth?

12:50.936 --> 12:53.189
Honey, it's Harvard and Dartmouth.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.649
Hmm. Nah. That doesn't sound right.

12:58.694 --> 12:59.528
Hey.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.322
This can't be right.

13:01.405 --> 13:03.491
Jackson, it says you got an "F."

13:05.576 --> 13:06.619
What?

13:07.077 --> 13:10.372
How is this possible?
You knew that material inside and out.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.999
I don't know what happened.

13:12.082 --> 13:15.169
Something isn't right.
And I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.797
We're gonna go down
to your school right now.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.717
I am so upset.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.845
I may exceed the speed limit
by three to five miles an hour.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.057
But I probably won't.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.896
[Becky] Yay!

13:35.689 --> 13:38.484
You were awfully quiet on the way home.
Are you OK?

13:40.236 --> 13:41.070
Yeah.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.447
Yeah, I've just been thinking.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.448
You know.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.576
I mean, what if I go to all this trouble

13:48.160 --> 13:50.663
and find a donor, and then a surrogate,

13:51.247 --> 13:53.499
and after all that, it still doesn't work?

13:54.208 --> 13:55.042
Oh, Steph.

13:55.709 --> 13:59.338
It's one thing to look back and say,
"I wish this would have worked."

14:00.464 --> 14:03.300
But you don't want to say,
"I wish I would have tried."

14:04.051 --> 14:04.969
Because who knows?

14:05.803 --> 14:07.179
You might just get...

14:07.930 --> 14:09.431
one of these!

14:11.892 --> 14:13.561
Come here, you!

14:17.523 --> 14:19.191
[Stephanie] That's not fair.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.318
I don't even know how much all this costs.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.653
It's got to be expensive.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.364
Before you make a decision,
get the facts.

14:25.948 --> 14:26.782
All right.

14:27.491 --> 14:28.325
But...

14:28.742 --> 14:30.369
can we keep this just between us?

14:30.744 --> 14:32.663
I don't want to get everyone's hopes up.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.039
Especially mine.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.417
I understand.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.878
And if anyone can keep a secret,
it's me and Tommy.

14:38.961 --> 14:39.795
Right, Tommy?

14:39.879 --> 14:40.963
Shh.

14:41.505 --> 14:42.756
Shh.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.679
-Down.
-There you go. Down, down.

14:48.762 --> 14:51.015
-Go, go, go! Hurry!
-[Stephanie] Go down the slide.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.099
[Becky] Not too fast.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.315
Hey!

14:59.398 --> 15:00.774
What you doing?

15:03.777 --> 15:04.904
[Tommy] Slide down.

15:05.613 --> 15:06.822
[Pamela babbles]

15:09.074 --> 15:10.826
Welcome to our staged reading

15:10.910 --> 15:13.162
of "The Diary of Max Fuller."

15:14.371 --> 15:18.709
I can't believe we got front-row seats,
last minute!

15:25.591 --> 15:28.677
Get. Me. Down.

15:30.804 --> 15:31.889
Hush!

15:32.473 --> 15:35.309
No talking during the performance.

15:35.392 --> 15:36.435
Wait. I'm sorry. I--

15:44.818 --> 15:46.403
"Dear Diary,

15:46.487 --> 15:48.614
when I marry my girlfriend, Rose,

15:48.697 --> 15:51.492
I'll wear a slim-fit tux by Hugo Boss,

15:51.575 --> 15:54.036
with a turned-out lapel
and a third button.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.794
Will I outshine the bride?

16:01.877 --> 16:02.962
Not my problem."

16:04.046 --> 16:05.923
She would not like that...

16:06.006 --> 16:07.383
[Lewis] No, she would not.

16:08.008 --> 16:10.511
OK, Joey.
There's a new sheriff in town.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.972
His name is Tough Love Gladstone.

16:13.430 --> 16:14.682
I can do this.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.601
[in cowboy voice] I'm gonna run
those bad-behaving varmints

16:17.685 --> 16:19.603
right out of this here town.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.274
[laughing]

16:25.609 --> 16:27.403
[as cowboy]
Listen, you whippersnappers.

16:31.490 --> 16:34.493
Things are gonna change
around these here parts.

16:36.495 --> 16:37.371
They are?

16:38.539 --> 16:39.540
I can't do this.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.423
Sheriff Tough Love isn't very tough.

16:49.133 --> 16:52.261
You know what happens to spoiled kids
who do whatever they want?

16:52.886 --> 16:55.139
-What?
-They become Kardashians!

16:57.516 --> 17:00.352
And they build a brand,
and they become millionaires.

17:01.478 --> 17:02.855
That sounds pretty good.

17:03.397 --> 17:04.440
Watch this.

17:06.316 --> 17:08.277
All right Gladstones, listen up!

17:08.736 --> 17:10.237
No more messing around.

17:10.821 --> 17:14.450
If any of you misbehave
even one more time,

17:14.533 --> 17:16.577
there will be no Disneyland.

17:16.660 --> 17:17.661
[all gasp]

17:19.538 --> 17:20.789
Am I clear?

17:20.873 --> 17:22.166
-Yes, Dad.
-[Lewis] Of course.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.167
Yes, Daddy.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.085
That's more like it.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.462
[Max squealing]

17:26.545 --> 17:28.255
[Gladstone Four squealing]

17:31.842 --> 17:34.928
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you guys doing?

17:35.387 --> 17:36.972
It's our secret language.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.891
-It means we love you.
-Yeah.

17:38.974 --> 17:41.727
[Max squealing]

17:42.311 --> 17:44.396
Well, then I...

17:44.772 --> 17:47.191
[squealing]

17:49.526 --> 17:51.403
...you, too. [laughs]

17:59.912 --> 18:01.747
You have no idea what you've done.

18:02.122 --> 18:04.750
You will rue the day
you awoke the sleeping dragon.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.710
[shouts] Vengeance will be--

18:10.464 --> 18:11.298
[Lewis] See ya!

18:11.673 --> 18:12.925
-[Joan] See ya forever!
-Bye!

18:13.008 --> 18:14.676
[Phyllis] Bye-bye. Toodles!

18:16.428 --> 18:18.597
[sobs]

18:25.020 --> 18:26.146
Mr. Byenberg.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.315
My tuna fish sandwich.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.151
This is...

18:31.235 --> 18:33.403
Oh! You're not really gonna eat that?

18:33.987 --> 18:34.822
No.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.323
That would be disgusting.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.499
Excuse me.
I'm here to talk about my son.

18:45.582 --> 18:46.875
Can I just wait in the car?

18:46.959 --> 18:47.793
No.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.380
Jackson's grade did not reflect
the work that he put in.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.423
He is smart and capable,

18:53.507 --> 18:55.926
and he already had his sights set
on Har-vard.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.345
Harvard.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.514
Look, Jackson was ready for that test,

19:00.597 --> 19:02.766
and I know because I quizzed him.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.184
And yet, he failed.

19:05.018 --> 19:05.853
So...

19:06.353 --> 19:08.397
If it wasn't his fault
and it wasn't mine,

19:08.480 --> 19:09.982
then whose fault could it be?

19:10.065 --> 19:11.817
Jackson's score was not my fault.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.068
How do you explain it?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.570
I was confused, too.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.613
So, I regraded it by hand.

19:17.531 --> 19:21.076
It turns out, he started on line two,
instead of line number one.

19:22.953 --> 19:24.079
You knucklehead.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.624
Which means he actually got a 94.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.419
You genius!

19:31.879 --> 19:34.381
I'm so happy for Jackson, I could smile.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.010
Go ahead.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.512
He is.

19:42.723 --> 19:43.557
I'm proud of you.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.061
I am so sorry, that I just...

19:48.437 --> 19:52.399
You know, you teachers are underpaid,
and you're doing God's work.

19:52.482 --> 19:54.860
You're a good man, Mr. Byenberg.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.654
I'm actually dating someone.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.034
She's a very lucky woman.

20:02.117 --> 20:02.951
Yeah, I...

20:04.036 --> 20:05.162
[Jackson] Yeah. Let's...

20:07.623 --> 20:09.625
Oh, Kimmy, look at them clean.

20:10.500 --> 20:14.338
All because they're scared
they won't get to go to Disneyland.

20:16.506 --> 20:17.716
I told you.

20:17.799 --> 20:20.886
The secret to good parenting
is to figure out what they love most

20:20.969 --> 20:22.638
and then threaten to take it away.

20:24.848 --> 20:28.101
Father, you have lint on your shirt.
May we?

20:30.395 --> 20:33.315
Yes, you may, my little fuzz-busters.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.572
Can we go to Disneyland now?

20:41.907 --> 20:42.866
Father?

20:44.910 --> 20:46.703
Yes, we can!

20:46.787 --> 20:48.038
[excited screaming]

20:48.622 --> 20:51.750
Joey, look what the Badstones did
to my dinosaur.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.336
And my collectible Cabbage Patch dolls.

20:55.629 --> 20:58.298
They ripped their heads off
and switched their bodies.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.301
We did not do that.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.762
[mockingly] "We did not do that."

21:08.475 --> 21:10.519
It's not cute when you do it.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.817
"It's not cute when you do it."

21:17.693 --> 21:19.069
OK. All right. All right. OK.

21:19.486 --> 21:22.698
Max, Ramona, I'm sorry about your toys.

21:23.573 --> 21:24.908
I'll get them replaced, OK?

21:25.867 --> 21:27.494
As for you four,

21:28.078 --> 21:29.913
there will be no Disneyland.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.373
-What?
-[Jerry] That's not fair!

21:31.957 --> 21:33.083
[Joey] Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.460
That's right. We're staying here tonight.

21:35.544 --> 21:36.586
Wait a minute!

21:39.673 --> 21:40.799
They're staying?

21:41.883 --> 21:45.512
So, we destroyed a pterodactyl
and a Cabbage Patch doll for nothing?

21:47.973 --> 21:48.849
Hold on.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.851
You ripped the heads off?

21:51.435 --> 21:52.352
That's right.

21:52.436 --> 21:53.687
And we'd do it again.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.984
Anything to get back at these creatures
from the Blond Lagoon.

22:01.028 --> 22:01.903
Wait a minute.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.656
That means my kids were good,

22:05.282 --> 22:08.785
and that means we're going to Disneyland!

22:08.869 --> 22:10.746
[excited squealing]

22:15.000 --> 22:16.668
What are you two so happy about?

22:18.253 --> 22:19.671
They're leaving!

22:23.884 --> 22:25.635
Get your party hats on.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.138
I made Jackson wait until we were ready.

22:28.722 --> 22:31.433
[shouts] Jackson!
Your surprise party's starting again!

22:31.516 --> 22:32.476
Act surprised!

22:35.103 --> 22:36.688
-Hey, guys.
-Hi.

22:36.772 --> 22:37.606
[Becky] Hey!

22:38.565 --> 22:40.025
Congratulations?

22:40.609 --> 22:42.819
You told them there's a chance
I could have a baby?

22:45.155 --> 22:46.031
Stephanie...

22:46.114 --> 22:48.158
This is exactly what I was afraid of.

22:48.241 --> 22:52.287
You guys would make way too big a deal
out of it, with balloons and party hats

22:52.370 --> 22:55.165
and a cake that says
"Congratulations, Jackson!"

22:58.376 --> 23:00.629
Oh! You know. Never mind.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.006
There's a chance you could have a baby?

23:03.090 --> 23:05.133
And I'm going to Disneyland?

23:08.345 --> 23:09.304
What a day!

23:11.890 --> 23:14.893
Well, there's a possibility,
with the help of a surrogate,

23:14.976 --> 23:16.478
that Stephanie can have a baby.

23:16.937 --> 23:17.938
[Joey] That is amazing.

23:18.021 --> 23:18.897
Amazing news!

23:18.980 --> 23:20.232
No, just hold on, OK?

23:20.315 --> 23:23.443
Don't get too excited, because
I've decided that I'm not doing it.

23:23.527 --> 23:24.820
-[Becky] Steph.
-[all] What?

23:24.903 --> 23:26.113
-[Joey] Wait.
-[DJ] Hey.

23:26.196 --> 23:27.364
Why not?

23:27.447 --> 23:28.573
Wow!

23:28.657 --> 23:30.742
A Jackson-is-a-genius party?

23:32.244 --> 23:33.411
I had no idea.

23:33.495 --> 23:34.788
You guys.

23:37.791 --> 23:41.461
Hey, if I'm gonna act surprised,
you guys can at least act happy.

23:47.050 --> 23:49.344
Steph, I need to talk to you.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.638
As long as it's not about a baby.

23:52.305 --> 23:53.348
It's about a baby.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.601
You have to give it a try.

23:57.185 --> 23:58.478
Isn't that my decision?

23:58.562 --> 24:00.856
Not if you're hesitating because of money.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.066
Becky, I looked into this.

24:03.441 --> 24:04.985
There's no way I can afford it.

24:05.902 --> 24:07.404
Yes, there is a way.

24:07.487 --> 24:08.697
Come on in, guys!

24:11.283 --> 24:12.117
[Joey] Hey.

24:12.826 --> 24:14.202
-[Kimmy] Hey.
-Hi.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.120
[Stephanie] Hey.

24:15.495 --> 24:16.663
What's going on?

24:17.164 --> 24:19.416
Well, we all want to chip in and help out.

24:20.041 --> 24:22.961
I spoke to Jesse, we're supporting you
every step of the way.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.006
And the Gladstones are in.

24:26.590 --> 24:27.841
The Gibblers are in, too.

24:27.924 --> 24:29.301
And so is Fernando.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.305
I know Kimmy was speaking for both of us,

24:33.388 --> 24:34.973
but I just wanted to talk.

24:36.892 --> 24:37.934
And I talked to Dad.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.145
He said, "Whatever Stephanie needs."

24:43.523 --> 24:44.482
Wow.

24:45.734 --> 24:46.651
[Tommy] Steph.
