00:59.314 --> 01:00.315
God.

01:05.254 --> 01:06.255
Hello.

01:07.823 --> 01:08.824
Hi, Mom.

01:10.893 --> 01:11.894
Yeah.

01:12.995 --> 01:13.996
Thank you.

01:14.963 --> 01:17.443
Of course you're the first one.
Why wouldn't you be?

01:18.867 --> 01:21.347
Yeah, I look forward to seeing you, too.

01:22.571 --> 01:25.518
Yeah, honey, I'll see you later today. Okay.

01:28.277 --> 01:30.848
Does your mother always call you
at the crack of dawn?

01:31.246 --> 01:32.725
Only on my birthday.

01:34.249 --> 01:36.195
You didn't tell me it was your birthday.

01:36.318 --> 01:38.059
Huh. Didn't I?

01:38.387 --> 01:40.128
Well, I think I would've remembered.

01:41.557 --> 01:44.128
Okay, how old?

01:46.094 --> 01:47.095
Forty-six.

01:48.730 --> 01:50.300
Forty-six?

01:50.432 --> 01:52.241
That's not... That's not old.

01:54.303 --> 01:56.749
Okay. What are we gonna do?

01:57.072 --> 01:58.574
Shooters at The Cove, baby.

01:58.874 --> 02:03.987
My buddy hooked up with a waitress,
so if we take him, we drink for free.

02:04.580 --> 02:09.291
Okay.

02:19.494 --> 02:20.495
Senna?

02:22.698 --> 02:26.237
- Senna?
- Yeah. Hi.

02:26.368 --> 02:27.813
Theo, you better hit the road.

02:29.705 --> 02:31.026
Can we hang out again?

02:31.106 --> 02:33.450
Oh. Yeah.

02:35.077 --> 02:36.078
Hi, how's it going?

02:38.680 --> 02:40.387
So my band's playing
at The Whiskey on Saturday.

02:40.482 --> 02:42.928
Wow, that's so great.

02:46.622 --> 02:48.568
He wanted to spend my birthday with me.

02:49.124 --> 02:51.547
The nerve.
That is a relationship killer, for sure.

02:51.627 --> 02:53.916
- He's not a relationship.
- Oh. Okay.

02:53.996 --> 02:54.997
He's a hookup.

02:56.598 --> 02:59.602
And anyway, I have plans
with you on my birthday.

02:59.968 --> 03:01.777
Movies and a tattoo, right?

03:02.904 --> 03:05.227
- Who are you calling?
- My friend from Boston.

03:05.307 --> 03:06.562
The one I told you about.

03:06.642 --> 03:11.500
Recently separated,
just moved to LA, very handsome.

03:11.580 --> 03:12.581
No setups.

03:13.081 --> 03:15.721
Oh, my God!

03:16.685 --> 03:18.961
You're engaged. Why didn't you tell me?

03:20.389 --> 03:22.644
You're afraid you can't be happy
in front of me.

03:22.724 --> 03:25.295
No, I just... It wasn't a big deal. I mean...

03:25.394 --> 03:27.049
- Come on!
- Plus, it's your birthday.

03:27.129 --> 03:28.335
I was gonna wait until...

03:29.665 --> 03:31.620
You're right. It kind of makes you
wanna scream, doesn't it?

03:31.700 --> 03:33.101
Yeah.

03:37.406 --> 03:39.784
That felt good. Oh, my gosh.

03:44.146 --> 03:46.268
- He did good.
- He did, right?

03:46.348 --> 03:48.021
- You wanna try it on?
- No!

03:49.251 --> 03:52.858
Why? Are you afraid you're gonna want one?

03:53.088 --> 03:54.624
Try it on. Try it on. Try it on.

03:56.992 --> 03:59.734
Look. It doesn't fit. How metaphorical.

04:01.396 --> 04:03.740
What are you gonna do now, buy a toaster?

04:04.299 --> 04:06.822
Get towels with your name on them?
Move to the Valley?

04:06.902 --> 04:09.405
I'm gonna meet his parents.
They're flying in Friday.

04:09.705 --> 04:11.708
We're having dinner at the Highland Tower.

04:11.840 --> 04:12.841
Fancy.

04:13.575 --> 04:16.579
Look, why don't you come to work
with me, and I'll suit you up.

04:16.945 --> 04:18.390
You should get a dog.

04:19.348 --> 04:21.003
Really? And why should I get a dog?

04:21.083 --> 04:23.038
Because a dog will help you quit smoking.

04:23.118 --> 04:27.089
You smoke because you're either
lonely or unsatisfied in your life.

04:27.789 --> 04:30.929
I smoke because people are annoying.

04:31.493 --> 04:32.494
Unsatisfied then.

04:34.496 --> 04:35.839
And a dog would help me how?

04:36.398 --> 04:39.846
It's not. It was for the loneliness.
Your thing is way worse.

04:44.673 --> 04:48.712
Whether you wade through hazardous waste
or just want to look like you do,

04:49.978 --> 04:52.857
Nicoletta Fumagalli has the boot for you.

04:53.148 --> 04:54.149
Orange!

04:55.117 --> 04:59.122
It's so vibrant and holy

05:00.355 --> 05:01.343
and preppy and...

05:01.423 --> 05:03.335
Oh, you look like a lemon.

05:04.426 --> 05:08.417
I love orange.
You can color-block it like Rothko...

05:08.497 --> 05:10.204
The dinner's not in Florida.

05:11.133 --> 05:12.134
Oh. No.

05:13.368 --> 05:15.245
Yeah, there you go.

05:15.437 --> 05:17.917
- Really?
- Come on, where's the trust?

05:18.340 --> 05:19.979
Okay, okay.

05:21.042 --> 05:24.683
Those boots are an inspiration.
I'll take 'em.

05:25.113 --> 05:26.114
You're the buyer.

05:27.115 --> 05:29.027
No. Senna, no.

05:29.317 --> 05:32.093
Yes. Yes, Darla, yes.

05:32.287 --> 05:34.062
- Pins.
- Sure.

05:35.891 --> 05:37.495
- Let's see.
- Here, babe.

05:38.093 --> 05:42.405
Right. I think we just pull this in.

05:42.531 --> 05:44.686
When are you gonna design
your own line of evening wear?

05:44.766 --> 05:50.080
You know, when I get a pony and gold
medal at the Olympics for skateboarding.

05:50.472 --> 05:53.995
You can pretend you're happy hawking
other people's crappy designs,

05:54.075 --> 05:57.352
but your stoner lifestyle suggests otherwise.

05:58.780 --> 06:01.659
So let's keep this in the A-line shape.

06:02.050 --> 06:04.496
You're the Picasso of design. Look.

06:04.920 --> 06:10.063
Yeah, well, Picasso didn't have two
decades of credit card debt to pay off.

06:16.364 --> 06:18.207
- Senna.
- Mommy.

06:18.333 --> 06:19.642
My baby.

06:20.635 --> 06:23.081
My beautiful birthday girl.

06:23.638 --> 06:25.083
Just look at you.

06:25.407 --> 06:28.786
- Jack, I'd like another green tea, please.
- Absolutely.

06:30.345 --> 06:32.086
Jack asked me how old you are.

06:32.314 --> 06:35.420
- People do that on your birthday, Mom.
- When you're five.

06:37.252 --> 06:38.424
Happy birthday, baby.

06:48.663 --> 06:49.664
Open it.

06:50.932 --> 06:52.377
Oh, Mom.

06:53.101 --> 06:55.707
Your father gave that to me
on our wedding day.

06:55.971 --> 07:00.352
It brought me 10 years of the best
love any woman could ever want.

07:01.142 --> 07:03.816
Kind of hoping it'll bring you
luck in that department.

07:05.514 --> 07:06.515
Put it on.

07:08.149 --> 07:09.184
Want me to help you?

07:09.684 --> 07:10.685
Got it.

07:11.453 --> 07:13.763
There. It's beautiful on you.

07:15.257 --> 07:17.863
Um, Darla told me that you're dating a fetus.

07:18.293 --> 07:21.035
- You talked to Darla?
- So it's true.

07:21.329 --> 07:23.571
Yes, Mom, I'm dating a fetus.

07:23.965 --> 07:27.469
It's kind of hard for us to get serious
with his mom always tagging along.

07:27.903 --> 07:31.510
- Let me tell you something about men.
- Oh, please do.

07:32.207 --> 07:36.519
Men don't fall in love with women
who don't take themselves seriously.

07:37.078 --> 07:41.652
They'll have sex with them, but then
they'll have sex with just about anybody.

07:42.551 --> 07:47.330
But when it comes to love, they want
a woman who's got her act together.

07:50.025 --> 07:56.636
I'm trying to acknowledge that
without sarcasm, but it's hard.

07:56.765 --> 08:00.304
Don't eat the bread.
If you're hungry, we'll order.

08:00.869 --> 08:03.577
By the way, just asking.

08:04.339 --> 08:06.928
What image do you think you project

08:07.008 --> 08:09.511
when you wear a top that you can see through?

08:10.245 --> 08:13.249
- It's Christian Dior, Mom.
- I don't care who it is.

08:14.115 --> 08:16.527
Showing your nipples
doesn't make you look chic.

08:16.718 --> 08:18.755
It just makes you look like a tart.

08:36.837 --> 08:38.078
Senna, come in.

08:41.509 --> 08:43.648
I have just one question.

08:44.946 --> 08:48.003
Are you kidding me?
Do you know who my customers are?

08:48.083 --> 08:50.839
Have you seen them?
Have you noticed what they're wearing?

08:50.919 --> 08:53.399
- Yes. The boot...
- Is orange!

08:53.822 --> 08:55.911
- Well, I thought...
- I know what you thought.

08:55.991 --> 08:59.063
That it would be fun and unique and daring.

08:59.361 --> 09:00.704
My customers are not daring!

09:00.829 --> 09:02.951
And it's not your job to reinvent them.

09:03.031 --> 09:05.409
It's your job to buy what they want to wear.

09:07.302 --> 09:09.491
I can't keep having
this conversation with you.

09:09.571 --> 09:11.676
I'm sorry, but we're done.

09:12.707 --> 09:15.882
- What do you mean?
- I mean you're fired.

09:22.984 --> 09:25.974
- You said we were staying in.
- I just ordered a ton of takeout,

09:26.054 --> 09:27.576
and I need help carrying it out.

09:27.656 --> 09:30.679
- It's really good.
- Surprise!

09:30.759 --> 09:31.760
Happy birthday!

09:32.861 --> 09:37.867
<i>Happy birthday, dear Senna</i>

09:38.933 --> 09:44.406
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

09:44.739 --> 09:46.946
- Make a wish.
- Don't waste it.

09:52.280 --> 09:53.281
Come on!

10:01.056 --> 10:03.712
- Senna!
- Lars.

10:03.792 --> 10:06.773
I got you something. It's on the house.

10:06.928 --> 10:09.135
Happy, happy birthday.

10:11.633 --> 10:12.634
Okay.

10:13.001 --> 10:14.002
Up-up-up.

10:14.202 --> 10:16.773
- Gonna need to see some ID.
- Oh, you.

10:16.971 --> 10:17.972
Mmm.

10:18.173 --> 10:20.595
- Sore subject?
- Little bit.

10:20.675 --> 10:23.698
Mmm. How about you, bud?
Can I get you something?

10:23.778 --> 10:27.726
Um... A frozen strawberry daiquiri, please.

10:29.451 --> 10:31.522
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

10:34.089 --> 10:36.968
It's the palm trees.
They make me feel like I'm on vacation.

10:38.059 --> 10:41.598
- Where are you from?
- Boston. Yeah.

10:42.263 --> 10:46.487
I moved out here a week ago.
I'm hoping to get discovered.

10:47.767 --> 10:50.213
Really? Actor or rock star?

10:51.106 --> 10:52.107
Rock star, obviously.

10:53.308 --> 10:56.221
- So what do you play?
- Nothing yet.

10:56.978 --> 11:00.323
It's really more of a backup plan
in case my day job doesn't work out.

11:01.182 --> 11:04.095
- What do you do?
- I'm a lawyer.

11:04.252 --> 11:05.253
Oh.

11:05.420 --> 11:08.299
My firm has offices out here.
They offered to relocate me,

11:09.624 --> 11:12.380
and I didn't want to turn down
a free trip to California.

11:12.460 --> 11:17.535
Well, when the inner rock star
beckons, better listen.

11:17.632 --> 11:19.771
You know what? That is so true.

11:20.468 --> 11:23.540
And my inner rock star
is extremely temperamental.

11:24.205 --> 11:28.085
One frozen strawberry daiquiri,
extra umbrella for you.

11:28.176 --> 11:29.951
Wow, thank you.

11:30.645 --> 11:32.147
So where are you squatting?

11:33.281 --> 11:34.282
Santa Monica.

11:34.916 --> 11:37.672
That is a long way to come for a daiquiri.

11:37.752 --> 11:41.700
It was. I'm supposed to meet someone
I knew from Boston, a woman I worked with.

11:42.290 --> 11:44.736
She's having a birthday party
for a friend of hers.

11:45.026 --> 11:48.283
Sei... Set... Sierra? Sierra or Henna.

11:48.363 --> 11:51.742
Some hippie, crunchy name
you only hear in California.

11:52.367 --> 11:54.711
I'm actually kind of relieved
I missed the party.

11:55.870 --> 11:58.544
Really? And why is that?

11:58.807 --> 12:00.695
- My friend Darla...
- Mmm-hmm.

12:00.775 --> 12:02.687
She kind of fancies herself as a matchmaker.

12:03.478 --> 12:05.967
- Does she? Uh-huh.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:06.047 --> 12:08.618
- And I hate to be set up.
- You do?

12:08.817 --> 12:10.972
Don't you? It's awful.

12:11.052 --> 12:12.759
So why'd you do it?

12:13.688 --> 12:14.689
She begged.

12:16.491 --> 12:19.267
- She begged?
- She kind of did.

12:19.427 --> 12:21.407
She begged!

12:22.897 --> 12:23.898
Oh.

12:24.499 --> 12:25.842
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:26.634 --> 12:27.989
- Her friend...
- Uh-huh.

12:28.069 --> 12:29.946
Kind of sounds like a train wreck.

12:30.939 --> 12:33.328
Yeah, she went to art school
for a couple of years.

12:33.408 --> 12:36.321
That obviously didn't work out,
and now she's working some...

12:36.945 --> 12:39.585
I don't know. Some kind of,
like, nowhere job in retail.

12:40.849 --> 12:45.161
She just sounds really unhappy,
like she's floundering around, so...

12:45.687 --> 12:49.635
So you don't really want to get set up.
You wanted a hookup.

12:51.359 --> 12:52.580
Yeah! You met her! Look at you!

12:52.660 --> 12:54.449
You're here! I looked all over for you.

12:54.529 --> 12:57.510
Oh, well, I am very small.
You have to look hard.

12:58.499 --> 13:00.502
I see that you've met Senna.

13:01.636 --> 13:05.015
- Not officially.
- Okay, well, let me do the honors.

13:05.206 --> 13:07.209
- Adam, this is Senna.
- Hi, Senna.

13:07.508 --> 13:09.030
Senna, this is Adam from Boston.

13:09.110 --> 13:11.466
We worked together briefly
during my confused period.

13:11.546 --> 13:15.653
He is a lawyer, but he has many
other attractive qualities.

13:16.818 --> 13:21.324
It was four years at FIDM
and a masters at Parsons,

13:21.689 --> 13:25.246
but I did get fired today
from that nowhere job,

13:25.326 --> 13:29.001
so I am officially
an unemployed hippie hookup.

13:29.430 --> 13:32.387
- I am so sorry. I had no idea.
- Wait. What? You're not a hippie.

13:32.467 --> 13:35.312
- You know what? I'm gonna go.
- Wait, what did I miss?

13:35.436 --> 13:36.891
I got these, okay?

13:36.971 --> 13:38.143
What did you talk about?

13:38.840 --> 13:39.828
Keep the change.

13:39.908 --> 13:42.320
- Adam!
- I'll call you, okay?

13:43.144 --> 13:44.933
What? What just happened?

13:45.013 --> 13:47.391
- I just said no setups.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

13:47.815 --> 13:49.317
Did you just say you got fired?

13:50.318 --> 13:51.695
Oh, God. Today?

13:52.320 --> 13:55.324
Oh, no. I'm sorry. But you know what?

13:55.757 --> 14:00.114
That's good because now you can start
your career as a designer.

14:00.194 --> 14:03.017
Yeah, people just wake up and say,

14:03.097 --> 14:05.453
"You know what? I'm gonna
start a new career today

14:05.533 --> 14:11.292
"because I have startup capital
and distribution and marketing..."

14:11.372 --> 14:13.761
Blah-blah-blah-blah. Negativity!

14:13.841 --> 14:16.253
You know what you are?
You're a raisin in the sun.

14:16.511 --> 14:19.890
- I'm a raisin?
- You are a talented, terrified raisin

14:20.048 --> 14:23.962
festering in your own self-doubt.
But I believe in you.

14:24.118 --> 14:26.274
I've always believed in you.
I believe in you.

14:26.354 --> 14:31.429
<i>I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe</i>

14:31.759 --> 14:33.432
<i>I believe in you</i>

14:33.561 --> 14:35.483
<i>Senna, I believe in you</i>

14:35.563 --> 14:37.886
<i>Everybody, I believe in you</i>

14:37.966 --> 14:40.021
<i>Lars, I believe in you</i>

14:40.101 --> 14:41.089
<i>Come on!</i>

14:41.169 --> 14:42.156
<i>I believe in you</i>

14:42.236 --> 14:43.758
<i>I don't see hands I believe in...</i>

14:43.838 --> 14:45.260
Okay, okay, it's a serious moment.

14:45.340 --> 14:47.582
I'm kidding. I'll get my purse! Just wait!

15:02.423 --> 15:03.424
Senna.

15:04.692 --> 15:07.468
Forgive me. Darla didn't beg.

15:08.696 --> 15:09.731
I wanted to come.

15:10.465 --> 15:13.344
When I walked in and I didn't
see her, I felt like an idiot.

15:13.568 --> 15:14.877
I was on my way out.

15:16.304 --> 15:18.477
Then I saw you sitting
at the bar by yourself.

15:20.408 --> 15:23.164
I just... I didn't want you to think I was
the kind of guy who needed a setup.

15:23.244 --> 15:25.247
It was stupid. I'm so sorry.

15:28.349 --> 15:29.350
It's cool.

15:33.654 --> 15:34.963
Happy birthday.

15:36.090 --> 15:37.091
Thanks.

15:46.034 --> 15:49.379
<i>What did I wish for?
You know I can't tell you that.</i>

15:49.937 --> 15:54.113
No, not a man or my name up in lights

15:55.276 --> 15:57.620
or bring back people from the dead

15:58.446 --> 16:02.019
or a pile of money on my doorstep,
though that would be nice.

16:03.418 --> 16:05.921
No, truth is, I'm good right where I am.

16:06.821 --> 16:10.645
I mean, little things would be nice,
like a flawless complexion,

16:10.725 --> 16:15.197
or my mother stopped making me
feel like I'm a disappointment to her.

16:17.165 --> 16:19.941
But I didn't waste my wish on those things.

16:31.112 --> 16:32.113
Hello?

16:34.315 --> 16:35.316
Yeah.

16:37.351 --> 16:39.831
Of course you're the first to call, Mom.

16:40.455 --> 16:42.401
It's the middle of the night.

16:46.227 --> 16:47.228
Thanks, Mom.

16:48.763 --> 16:49.764
I love you, too.

16:57.672 --> 17:00.209
- What's up?
- Sorry.

17:03.111 --> 17:04.750
I got some pancakes over here.

17:05.079 --> 17:06.455
Want some coffee?

17:08.316 --> 17:10.387
I forgot she was staying with you.

17:18.759 --> 17:21.035
- That's a good one. Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

17:22.029 --> 17:25.532
- Oh, I love this one.
- You can't have that. I need to sell that.

17:26.467 --> 17:28.656
You don't want me to live here
forever, do you?

17:28.736 --> 17:29.737
No. Good point.

17:31.873 --> 17:35.396
- <i>Bonjour, bonjour!</i>
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

17:35.476 --> 17:36.853
Yes, yes, yes!

17:37.712 --> 17:38.884
You're gonna love these.

17:39.180 --> 17:41.302
I already love the 14 you already brought me.

17:41.382 --> 17:44.989
Yes, but you said they weren't selling,
so I made some more.

17:46.821 --> 17:48.664
Look at this.

17:52.193 --> 17:54.833
- Jean-Michel!
- Dede!

17:54.996 --> 17:55.997
I have five minutes.

17:58.366 --> 18:00.121
- Show me something I have to have.
- This is kismet.

18:00.201 --> 18:03.011
Dede Zeller, meet Senna Berges.

18:04.038 --> 18:06.360
If she likes you, the world likes you.

18:06.440 --> 18:09.182
- Congratulations on your new store.
- Stores.

18:09.644 --> 18:10.645
Stores!

18:11.412 --> 18:12.413
Mmm.

18:13.781 --> 18:16.037
- Are these yours?
- Yes. They're prototypes.

18:16.117 --> 18:20.156
I have 21 that I've made so far.

18:20.688 --> 18:23.863
- Who's carrying them?
- Well, no one yet.

18:24.125 --> 18:26.380
- So you're in production?
- Well, no.

18:26.460 --> 18:29.717
I mean, I didn't know which ones
would catch on, so I just made them,

18:29.797 --> 18:32.744
and I thought I'd make more
when we see how they go.

18:34.769 --> 18:37.658
But, you know, I could design
exclusively for you

18:37.738 --> 18:42.330
for a little while or for
a long while, if you like.

18:42.410 --> 18:44.287
- I need to see those coats.
- Sure.

18:45.513 --> 18:46.514
Here.

18:49.217 --> 18:50.821
<i>Have you sold any of your purses?</i>

18:52.185 --> 18:55.743
Well, I had a meeting
with Dede Zeller this morning.

18:55.823 --> 18:58.736
- And?
- She seemed interested.

18:58.960 --> 19:02.183
Well, you have to stay on it. Be aggressive.

19:02.263 --> 19:03.435
I'm on it, Mom.

19:07.668 --> 19:08.669
Oh.

19:10.104 --> 19:11.674
You got me a place setting.

19:11.906 --> 19:15.354
Well, I believe every woman
should have a set of fine china.

19:15.843 --> 19:19.901
Since it doesn't look like you're ever gonna
get married, I thought I'd better start now.

19:19.981 --> 19:22.689
In 11 years, you'll have a complete set.

19:23.484 --> 19:25.225
Do you like that pattern? I love it.

19:26.787 --> 19:27.788
Are you sure?

19:31.158 --> 19:34.448
You know, we're gonna have
to talk about what you're gonna do

19:34.528 --> 19:36.405
once Darla gets married.

19:36.897 --> 19:40.572
I mean, she's not gonna be able to keep
a second apartment for you, you know.

19:40.968 --> 19:43.591
- I'll figure it out, Mom.
- Now, don't be a martyr.

19:43.671 --> 19:46.277
You know I've got plenty of extra room.

19:54.115 --> 19:56.322
Senna, what a surprise.

19:57.652 --> 19:59.825
- Is that one of yours?
- It is.

20:00.087 --> 20:03.865
Wow. It's gorgeous. I knew you had it in you.

20:03.991 --> 20:05.813
It's not for Elodie, of course.

20:05.893 --> 20:08.049
You know what?
You should talk to Dede Zeller.

20:08.129 --> 20:11.770
- She could really put you on the map.
- She is on my list.

20:11.899 --> 20:15.904
She likes edgy,
off-kilter stuff in weird colors.

20:16.270 --> 20:20.294
Well, in the meantime, just while
I'm getting this all going...

20:20.374 --> 20:22.396
It's taking a little longer than I thought,

20:22.476 --> 20:27.468
so, you know, I'm gonna need
a part-time job as a sales person,

20:27.548 --> 20:28.822
and I was just thinking...

20:30.217 --> 20:33.756
What, here? No, you don't want a job here.

20:33.921 --> 20:36.959
You finally found your calling.
Absolutely not.

20:44.632 --> 20:45.633
Shit.

21:08.022 --> 21:10.378
There she is, the guest of honor!
Happy birthday!

21:10.458 --> 21:14.372
Do you have any reflections on the past,
projections for the future?

21:14.695 --> 21:16.368
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

21:17.732 --> 21:20.679
- Hey. Place looks great.
- Hey. Thanks.

21:21.836 --> 21:24.392
- This is Bianca. Bianca, Darla.
- Very nice to meet...

21:24.472 --> 21:27.715
Oh, nice to meet you. Is she your colleague?

21:27.842 --> 21:30.049
Dance partners. We met at El Floridita.

21:30.745 --> 21:33.817
- Oh. You're teaching him how to dance.
- Oh, he's teaching me.

21:34.749 --> 21:36.228
Oh, look, right now.

21:37.218 --> 21:38.219
Okay.

21:40.721 --> 21:43.759
Save it for the party, you guys. Oh, my.

21:50.030 --> 21:51.886
- She's going to the bathroom.
- Whatever.

21:51.966 --> 21:55.470
- You remember my friend Senna, right?
- Oh. She left her drink.

21:56.003 --> 21:59.382
Oh. Okay, here, Adam.
She's on the poofy chair.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.683
Give it to her and say happy birthday.

22:02.743 --> 22:04.518
Hey, man. What's up, buddy?

22:07.848 --> 22:11.694
- Special order from Steve.
- Oh, thank you.

22:11.919 --> 22:14.729
- Adam.
- I remember you. The rock star.

22:14.922 --> 22:16.595
- Right.
- Get discovered yet?

22:17.024 --> 22:19.231
Sadly, I don't think
it's gonna happen for me.

22:19.393 --> 22:21.515
Well, not with that attitude.

22:21.595 --> 22:24.485
- The truth is, I'm tone-deaf.
- Oh, say it isn't so.

22:24.565 --> 22:28.206
Yeah, when I was in second grade,
my music teacher, Mr. Ponte,

22:28.702 --> 22:31.859
told me that some people
are meant to just mouth the words.

22:31.939 --> 22:35.045
- Ponte told you to lip-sync?
- He did.

22:35.309 --> 22:37.619
When I told my mom about it,
she went ballistic.

22:38.312 --> 22:40.451
And the strange thing, Mr. Ponte disappeared.

22:40.648 --> 22:43.322
- What a coincidence.
- That's what she told the police.

22:44.151 --> 22:45.858
- Crafty.
- She's crafty.

22:47.354 --> 22:49.630
- So you going to the wedding?
- Maid of honor.

22:49.890 --> 22:53.099
- I wanted to be maid of honor.
- Hope you didn't tell your mother.

22:53.394 --> 22:54.395
Lucky for you.

22:57.198 --> 23:00.087
So your date's pretty.
Is she worthy of a relationship

23:00.167 --> 23:02.044
or just hookup material like me?

23:02.169 --> 23:04.877
Don't let anyone ever accuse you
of holding on to things.

23:05.473 --> 23:08.648
- No judgment from me.
- I'll settle down eventually.

23:09.743 --> 23:11.699
I certainly don't want to grow old alone.

23:11.779 --> 23:15.056
- Eh. It's not so bad.
- You are not old.

23:15.616 --> 23:17.289
I am not young.

23:19.653 --> 23:22.276
You got a little pull

23:22.356 --> 23:25.428
on your sweater right there, I think. Shit.

23:26.060 --> 23:29.016
- Here, forget it.
- No, don't pull out. Pull in.

23:29.096 --> 23:31.552
- Pull in?
- Yes, pull in from the... You know.

23:31.632 --> 23:33.305
- Poke it?
- Yeah, no, you put it...

23:34.468 --> 23:37.057
You've just got to push it into the inside,

23:37.137 --> 23:39.708
and you've got to find the loose thread.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.444
And kind of... Take the...

23:41.609 --> 23:45.216
Pull like the whole thing right down...

23:48.048 --> 23:49.049
Hey.

23:54.288 --> 23:58.134
Um... Masters of fashion. Parsons.

23:58.759 --> 24:02.298
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

24:02.763 --> 24:06.438
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

24:06.567 --> 24:10.845
<i>Happy birthday, dear Senna</i>

24:10.971 --> 24:14.995
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

24:15.075 --> 24:16.076
Yay!

24:22.082 --> 24:24.722
Bianca, I could use your help
in the kitchen. You mind?

24:27.021 --> 24:30.594
Okay, let's get this party started.
Would you like a shot now?

24:30.724 --> 24:35.002
Oh, I would like one for me and one for you.

24:35.095 --> 24:37.439
- How could I turn that offer down?
- All righty.

24:39.066 --> 24:41.603
- <i>L'chaim!</i>
- <i>L'chaim!</i>

24:44.605 --> 24:45.726
Oh!

24:45.806 --> 24:50.152
Oh, shit! Oh, Steve. Yeah, I'm just... I'm...

24:51.378 --> 24:54.101
- You got it?
- Stinky. I'm just gonna...

24:54.181 --> 24:55.703
- You all right?
- Yeah. Fine.

24:55.783 --> 24:59.162
- You don't look it.
- Oh, no. I'm good. You kidding me?

25:00.120 --> 25:03.444
- I already know how to dance.
- Look out for the...

25:03.524 --> 25:04.525
Whoa!

25:04.692 --> 25:06.814
- Okay, I got you.
- If you wanted to dance...

25:06.894 --> 25:08.883
- You all right?
- ...you just had to say so.

25:08.963 --> 25:11.118
Here, let me just give you a hand.

25:11.198 --> 25:13.354
Here, hold that.
I'm just gonna get a T-shirt.

25:13.434 --> 25:14.421
Okay.

25:14.501 --> 25:17.958
And then I just want to lie down
for a little sec 'cause I'm...

25:18.038 --> 25:20.041
- You sure you're all right?
- You know...

25:21.208 --> 25:22.653
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.353
- Oh, that's good.
- Senna?

25:26.914 --> 25:27.915
You okay?

25:37.057 --> 25:38.058
Happy birthday.

25:39.126 --> 25:43.336
My friend Charlene threw me
a surprise party for my 40th birthday.

25:44.031 --> 25:48.302
She told my then husband to tell me he was
taking me out for dinner just the two of us.

25:49.236 --> 25:51.773
The morning of, he tells me
he'll pick me up at 8:00.

25:52.539 --> 25:55.729
At 8:30 he calls me from work,
tells me he's stuck with a client,

25:55.809 --> 25:57.618
and can I meet him at the restaurant?

25:58.412 --> 26:00.449
I tell him, "I don't want to go by myself."

26:00.714 --> 26:03.470
He says, "You have to.
Charlene's there with all your friends.

26:03.550 --> 26:05.154
"It's supposed to be a surprise."

26:06.520 --> 26:08.329
So I go.

26:09.056 --> 26:10.729
My friends shout, "Surprise!"

26:11.659 --> 26:13.764
I burst out crying.

26:16.196 --> 26:18.519
He was supposed to pick up
the cake on his way.

26:18.599 --> 26:21.910
He forgot, so we didn't have one.

26:25.272 --> 26:28.549
I let it ruin my whole birthday.

26:33.747 --> 26:35.556
I let it ruin my whole marriage.

26:37.151 --> 26:38.630
I don't even eat cake.

26:42.856 --> 26:43.857
What do I wish now?

26:47.628 --> 26:49.073
That I'd forgiven him.

27:03.243 --> 27:04.244
Hello?

27:07.247 --> 27:10.638
Thanks, Mom. Of course,
you're the first. Yeah, yeah.

27:10.718 --> 27:13.494
I'll meet you there. Okay. Bye-bye.

27:19.026 --> 27:21.233
Wow! Hey.

27:22.129 --> 27:24.518
I can't believe you're doing this
all by yourself.

27:24.598 --> 27:26.202
Well, believe it, baby.

27:26.533 --> 27:30.174
Here, drink this coffee.
I will paint. Trade you.

27:30.471 --> 27:33.384
- That's you. This is me.
- All right. All right.

27:33.907 --> 27:37.013
So you just dip it on one side.
Kind of shake it.

27:38.245 --> 27:41.192
Uh... This looks like high-gloss acrylic.

27:41.548 --> 27:44.529
High-gloss acrylic is for
bathrooms and indoor pools.

27:46.086 --> 27:48.623
- Oh, no!
- We can take my car.

27:48.922 --> 27:50.401
Oh, that's all right.

27:51.391 --> 27:53.313
I was supposed to take this back
first thing this morning.

27:53.393 --> 27:56.150
I took somebody else's order by accident.

27:56.230 --> 27:58.938
All right. And you return that.
I'll go get the paint.

27:59.166 --> 28:02.489
- Great.
- Give me the key. Key to the store.

28:02.569 --> 28:06.278
Don't worry about it. Just...
I never lock it. There's nothing to take.

28:07.407 --> 28:10.582
You already lost your keys. Oh, my God!

28:11.478 --> 28:15.756
Dude, record time. Record time.
Okay, I'll see you.

28:28.629 --> 28:29.664
This is...

28:29.763 --> 28:32.334
This is everything, I think.

28:33.367 --> 28:35.370
Definitely. That's all of it.

28:37.271 --> 28:39.842
Oh, my God, that coat.

28:42.276 --> 28:44.188
It's just my mother's favorite color.

28:44.311 --> 28:47.850
I can sell it to you for $600.
That's at cost.

28:51.819 --> 28:52.820
Sold.

28:53.187 --> 28:55.509
- Okay, listen, your order's over there.
- Okay.

28:55.589 --> 28:58.045
It's $9,200. $9,800 with the coat.

28:58.125 --> 29:00.114
Okay. And you're gonna bill me in 90 days.

29:00.194 --> 29:02.649
Not unless you have a lot of
credit from the factor.

29:02.729 --> 29:06.153
When I was with Elodie K,
you let me defer for 90 days.

29:06.233 --> 29:10.375
Yes, but I've been in business
with Elodie K for 15 years.

29:15.676 --> 29:18.054
I just... I don't have the credit.

29:19.213 --> 29:21.435
If you don't give them to me,
I can't open my store.

29:21.515 --> 29:24.394
Nobody else is gonna do this, either.
It's not just me.

29:24.551 --> 29:27.054
Listen, I'll give you the coat. I'm sorry.

29:29.456 --> 29:31.265
- Okay?
- Yeah. Thanks.

29:33.527 --> 29:35.837
How am I gonna get $10,000?

29:36.597 --> 29:38.634
Here. Happy birthday.

29:39.466 --> 29:42.914
- Ooh. What, no china?
- Come on, open it.

29:45.505 --> 29:47.382
It's an accounting program!

29:47.975 --> 29:50.731
Well, your gifts just keep
getting better and better and better.

29:50.811 --> 29:52.484
Thank you. I'm glad you like them.

29:52.679 --> 29:53.988
And I have one for you.

29:54.381 --> 29:56.088
- You didn't.
- I did.

29:56.750 --> 29:57.751
Senna!

29:59.887 --> 30:02.766
That is so beautiful.

30:03.257 --> 30:07.467
I can't believe you got that for me.
Thank you, honey.

30:07.861 --> 30:10.284
- How much was it? I'll reimburse you.
- A present.

30:10.364 --> 30:12.686
No, no, no. I don't want you
spending money on me

30:12.766 --> 30:14.454
when you're getting your business together.

30:14.534 --> 30:15.535
Mom, one coat.

30:17.771 --> 30:19.978
Then you're all right for money?

30:21.041 --> 30:25.786
I underestimated my startup costs.

30:26.613 --> 30:27.614
Uh-oh.

30:27.748 --> 30:28.749
How much?

30:30.951 --> 30:33.774
- A few thousand.
- A few thousand?

30:33.854 --> 30:38.064
- $10,000.
- You're $10,000 short?

30:40.394 --> 30:42.670
Senna, what are you gonna do?

30:43.430 --> 30:47.469
I was thinking of asking you for a loan.

30:49.069 --> 30:52.847
You want me to loan it to you?
Absolutely not.

30:54.041 --> 30:55.611
I'll give it to you.

31:00.147 --> 31:03.651
- You will?
- Of course I will. We'll be partners.

31:05.352 --> 31:09.042
- How did it go?
- Oh, my God, it was fabulous!

31:09.122 --> 31:10.277
- Really?
- It was perfect.

31:10.357 --> 31:11.802
She's gonna give me the money.

31:12.025 --> 31:14.028
- Great!
- Yeah, she wants to be partners.

31:14.895 --> 31:15.836
What?

31:21.268 --> 31:24.147
- This is wet paint, isn't it?
- Yeah.

31:26.673 --> 31:29.051
I am so fucked.

31:30.110 --> 31:33.533
- How much do you need?
- Like, $10,000.

31:33.613 --> 31:34.853
$50,000.

31:36.183 --> 31:38.105
What? Who are you talking to?

31:38.185 --> 31:40.131
Okay, she'll be right there. Thanks.

31:42.856 --> 31:45.029
Hey. Happy birthday.

31:46.493 --> 31:49.167
- Thanks.
- Good to see you. Come on in.

31:51.298 --> 31:54.643
- Have a seat.
- I, um... I can't.

31:57.337 --> 31:58.338
Oh.

31:58.739 --> 32:02.050
- Still a little tacky. Yeah.
- Got it. Okay.

32:03.210 --> 32:05.452
Darla told me about
your little credit problem.

32:05.879 --> 32:09.224
Oh. Problem's a bit of
an overstatement. It's...

32:11.551 --> 32:14.327
- What's that?
- It's an application for a line of credit.

32:14.955 --> 32:16.628
$50,000 preapproved.

32:17.424 --> 32:18.425
How...

32:19.826 --> 32:23.283
It's really not a big deal. And now
you'll have access to enough money

32:23.363 --> 32:25.352
so you and your mom don't kill each other.

32:25.432 --> 32:27.674
- Hey. Your mom's the killer.
- Alleged killer.

32:29.202 --> 32:31.079
If you need a minute to look it over...

32:32.672 --> 32:34.242
No, it...

32:36.243 --> 32:38.519
- Yeah, it looks good.
- Okay.

32:39.079 --> 32:43.450
So all you've got to do is sign
right here, and we're good.

32:57.097 --> 32:59.737
- Perfect.
- Thank you for bailing me out.

33:00.233 --> 33:02.270
Well, I wasn't going to, but Darla begged.

33:08.341 --> 33:12.790
Oh... Darla and Steve are taking me
to dinner for my birthday.

33:13.380 --> 33:17.556
I'd be delighted if you'd like to join us.
You can bring Charo.

33:18.318 --> 33:20.298
- Bianca.
- Bianca.

33:20.954 --> 33:23.264
If it's all right,
I'd rather just bring myself.

33:26.359 --> 33:28.703
- Wonderful.
- Great.

33:30.397 --> 33:31.398
Just push.

33:36.937 --> 33:37.938
Thanks.

33:41.775 --> 33:43.397
To the birthday girl
and future fashion mogul.

33:43.477 --> 33:47.868
Oh, no, no. To all of you
for collectively saving my ass,

33:47.948 --> 33:49.791
though I didn't deserve it. Thank you.

33:50.250 --> 33:51.251
You're welcome.

33:52.285 --> 33:54.925
I see you're wearing your
magic love karma necklace.

33:55.088 --> 33:59.537
Oh, yes, my mother gave this to me
for my birthday a couple of years ago

33:59.893 --> 34:03.602
when she still had hopes that I could
find a man to have sober sex with.

34:05.031 --> 34:07.671
It's endowed with special powers
to help her find love.

34:08.101 --> 34:09.205
Yeah, it's not working.

34:10.170 --> 34:13.326
Your soulmate is out there.
You'll find him when the time is right.

34:13.406 --> 34:16.096
Soulmate? Aren't we a little
old to believe in soulmates?

34:16.176 --> 34:18.864
You're just skeptical 'cause
you haven't found yours yet.

34:18.945 --> 34:22.202
- You do remember I was married?
- Yes, I do remember you were married.

34:22.282 --> 34:25.105
And if she was your soulmate,
you'd still be married to her.

34:25.185 --> 34:27.174
There are billions of people in the world.

34:27.254 --> 34:29.632
Surely, I could be happy with,
I don't know, five?

34:30.157 --> 34:32.262
True love only happens once.

34:32.458 --> 34:34.199
You realize how infantile you sound?

34:35.094 --> 34:36.734
Was your ex the love of your life?

34:36.996 --> 34:40.120
I was 25 when we got married.
We didn't even know who we were yet.

34:40.199 --> 34:43.422
What, you think there's a magic age
where you arrive at who you are?

34:43.503 --> 34:44.690
If there is, it's not 25.

34:44.771 --> 34:46.760
If she was the love of
your life, you would know it.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.829
You've been married for
how long now, six months?

34:48.909 --> 34:51.731
- I've... Seven.
- Talk to me in seven years.

34:51.811 --> 34:54.701
If I get married again,
and I'm not sure I will, but if I do,

34:54.781 --> 34:57.204
I will vet my future wife
much more thoroughly.

34:57.284 --> 34:59.924
- You'll vet her?
- Yes.

35:00.187 --> 35:03.794
- For smallpox?
- If necessary.

35:04.591 --> 35:08.061
No, for values, interests,
intellect, sense of humor.

35:08.528 --> 35:09.950
- He has a list.
- He has a list.

35:10.030 --> 35:13.409
Being in love is not some magical feeling
that suddenly comes over you.

35:13.833 --> 35:16.643
Relationships are work.
Your priorities have to be aligned.

35:17.137 --> 35:20.585
My problem when I got married was
I didn't know my priorities. Now I do.

35:20.974 --> 35:23.296
Love has never sounded so logical.

35:23.376 --> 35:25.265
Easy to judge. You've never been married.

35:25.345 --> 35:27.757
Senna doesn't believe in marriage, right?

35:27.881 --> 35:31.795
Well, I just don't think that you need
a contract to prove that you love somebody.

35:32.018 --> 35:34.708
- We don't need it.
- Then why did you do it?

35:34.788 --> 35:39.179
Because it's a tradition recognized
by virtually every civilization

35:39.259 --> 35:42.263
on the face of the planet
for the last 4,000 years.

35:43.196 --> 35:46.177
As with most traditions,
I agree that marriage is unnecessary.

35:46.633 --> 35:48.455
But isn't it the unnecessary things in life

35:48.535 --> 35:51.573
that make the human experience
so fascinating?

35:54.641 --> 35:58.145
So who do you think Steve and Darla
would vote most unromantic, me or you?

35:58.245 --> 36:00.225
- Oh, you.
- Me?

36:01.214 --> 36:03.036
I'm not the one who said,
"I don't believe in marriage."

36:03.116 --> 36:07.674
Oh, yeah. "Love is a vetting
process" is way more romantic.

36:07.754 --> 36:10.210
Look, I want to be with someone
who lights me up.

36:10.290 --> 36:11.745
I'm just realistic about the fact

36:11.825 --> 36:13.880
that there's more than
one woman out there who can.

36:13.960 --> 36:17.117
Well, then you just keep on
sampling until you find them.

36:17.197 --> 36:18.585
Isn't that what you're doing?

36:18.665 --> 36:22.272
No, I am enjoying my body until it craps out.

36:22.802 --> 36:24.858
Maybe you're setting your standards too low.

36:24.938 --> 36:28.943
Or too high. Maybe I haven't met
anybody who really appreciates me.

36:29.042 --> 36:30.146
Oh.

36:30.877 --> 36:32.220
So you want to be worshipped.

36:32.445 --> 36:36.069
Well, I'm not gonna give myself
to someone who thinks I'm one in five.

36:36.149 --> 36:38.672
- You know what your problem is?
- I have a myriad of problems.

36:38.752 --> 36:41.028
You think you're so incredibly unique

36:41.721 --> 36:44.911
that any man who isn't struck by lightning
the moment he lays eyes on you

36:44.991 --> 36:46.179
doesn't deserve you.

36:46.259 --> 36:48.899
- And how is that a problem?
- You expect him to know

36:49.496 --> 36:50.650
the minute he meets you.

36:50.730 --> 36:55.488
It is called living in the moment,
and maybe you, sir, should give it a try.

36:55.568 --> 36:56.842
I am plenty in the moment.

36:57.937 --> 37:00.179
You are the opposite of in the moment.

37:17.957 --> 37:18.958
Not always.

37:29.769 --> 37:32.716
<i>There's certainly no shortage
of things to want.</i>

37:33.173 --> 37:35.915
Better house, better car, better boobs.

37:38.478 --> 37:40.973
I suppose,

37:41.854 --> 37:44.240
at one point in my youth,

37:44.984 --> 37:46.827
I wished for all of those things.

37:48.455 --> 37:49.764
Every woman does.

37:50.457 --> 37:52.630
And if they tell you
otherwise, they're lying.

37:53.526 --> 37:56.769
I mean, we all feel inadequate.
It's the American way.

37:58.198 --> 37:59.199
But,

38:01.201 --> 38:02.510
somehow, when...

38:04.204 --> 38:05.877
When Senna was born,

38:07.407 --> 38:09.182
all those things just...

38:10.443 --> 38:13.288
Not that I don't appreciate them anymore.
Of course I do.

38:13.880 --> 38:17.987
But she just filled me up.

38:21.788 --> 38:24.064
Everything I wanted, I wanted for her.

38:27.293 --> 38:28.602
What can I say?

38:29.262 --> 38:31.401
She stole all my wishes.

39:09.469 --> 39:10.812
- You okay?
- Yeah, I just...

39:11.237 --> 39:12.726
- What?
- What if she tried to call?

39:12.806 --> 39:14.961
I mean, it's late,
and I haven't heard from her...

39:15.041 --> 39:18.250
- Honey, it's just been like 10 seconds.
- I know, but...

39:18.411 --> 39:19.866
- You know.
- Okay.

39:19.946 --> 39:22.736
- Just, I'm worried and...
- You wanna call her, you should call her.

39:22.816 --> 39:26.573
Do you mind? I just... Do you think
she'd be mad if I call her before she...

39:26.653 --> 39:27.654
No. No.

39:27.987 --> 39:28.988
Okay.

39:34.627 --> 39:36.732
It's ringing. All right.

39:37.197 --> 39:38.198
Okay.

39:42.268 --> 39:43.804
Room 507, please.

39:46.072 --> 39:49.349
Mom! Mom, hi.

39:50.376 --> 39:54.290
Yeah, I just wanted you to be
the first to wish me...

39:55.281 --> 39:56.282
Yeah.

39:59.319 --> 40:01.492
I'll come by and see you
in a couple of hours.

40:03.089 --> 40:04.090
Of course.

40:05.058 --> 40:07.732
All right. You get some rest.

40:08.761 --> 40:09.762
I love you, too.

40:12.131 --> 40:13.132
Bye.

40:14.801 --> 40:17.475
- She sounds so tired.
- Yeah, what'd she say?

40:17.904 --> 40:20.248
You know, "Happy birthday."

40:20.673 --> 40:22.949
- You'll feel better when you see her.
- I know.

40:25.345 --> 40:28.053
- God, I love you.
- I love you.

40:28.414 --> 40:30.291
No, you don't understand.

40:31.551 --> 40:34.054
It's ground-breaking for me.

40:34.554 --> 40:39.060
I mean, it's hard for me to find someone
I want to spend the weekend with,

40:40.426 --> 40:42.531
let alone the rest of my life.

40:44.564 --> 40:46.544
Why are you smiling?

40:49.569 --> 40:52.243
- I've got to go to work.
- Okay.

40:57.877 --> 40:59.065
I don't have any clean underwear here, do I?

40:59.145 --> 41:00.133
Uh...

41:00.213 --> 41:02.955
You can only turn the same pair
inside out so many times.

41:03.883 --> 41:05.226
Really, only once.

41:06.286 --> 41:07.925
Maybe in your gym bag?

41:14.160 --> 41:15.161
Sorry, I didn't hear.

41:16.095 --> 41:17.096
Uh...

41:17.363 --> 41:18.774
- Did you find any?
- No.

41:19.532 --> 41:20.533
Uh-uh.

41:21.401 --> 41:22.402
Okay.

41:34.847 --> 41:37.828
How's your baby? It's a baby in there.

41:39.185 --> 41:41.427
- He's going to ask me to marry him.
- What?

41:42.388 --> 41:45.745
I found the ring. Well, not the ring,
but the ring box. It was in his gym bag.

41:45.825 --> 41:48.014
- He got you a ring?
- He didn't mention it to you?

41:48.094 --> 41:49.095
No.

41:49.829 --> 41:51.604
Well, he probably knew you'd tell me.

41:52.899 --> 41:55.436
- What's with the face?
- Nothing, it's just my face.

41:56.269 --> 41:57.976
No, I'm just surprised.

41:58.237 --> 42:00.593
- That he would want to marry me?
- Honey, no.

42:00.673 --> 42:04.297
That he would ask, knowing
how strongly you felt about marriage.

42:04.377 --> 42:06.733
Maybe he realized he cannot live without me.

42:06.813 --> 42:09.555
Well, maybe.

42:09.749 --> 42:13.253
It's just, you've always been clear
that you never wanted to get married.

42:14.420 --> 42:18.778
Well, that was because I never thought
anyone would want to marry me,

42:18.858 --> 42:21.338
but he does.

42:21.861 --> 42:24.603
- And he's willing to fight for me.
- Oh, yeah.

42:25.732 --> 42:27.177
That makes all the difference.

42:28.001 --> 42:30.657
Senna. Senna! 12:00, you've got to go.

42:30.737 --> 42:31.738
Oh.

42:34.040 --> 42:36.496
Okay, look, don't go into labor.

42:36.576 --> 42:40.183
I just... I can't handle any more
excitement for today, okay?

42:41.381 --> 42:45.090
- Are you feeling something?
- What? Oh, no. I'm okay.

42:53.893 --> 42:55.395
Mother of the birthday girl.

42:56.896 --> 42:57.966
Happy birthday, honey.

43:00.733 --> 43:02.713
I don't have a present for you.

43:03.136 --> 43:07.107
I thought about going down
to the gift shop here,

43:08.007 --> 43:11.716
but I wouldn't want anything
from this hellhole.

43:11.878 --> 43:13.199
Mom, come on.

43:13.279 --> 43:16.089
Except what they've already taken from me.

43:21.154 --> 43:24.363
I asked the doctor if I could
take them home, he said no.

43:25.692 --> 43:28.468
Well, your father got to keep
his kidney stone.

43:32.799 --> 43:35.780
And I worked so hard to keep them perky.

43:38.071 --> 43:40.142
But that's not why I didn't breastfeed you.

43:44.210 --> 43:45.917
Get some water, Mom.

43:52.452 --> 43:53.988
- That's good.
- All right?

43:59.992 --> 44:02.234
Have you ever wondered
why it took you so long?

44:03.529 --> 44:06.066
To start my business?

44:06.499 --> 44:09.503
Yeah, it was my fault.

44:10.403 --> 44:12.076
I was too protective.

44:12.672 --> 44:15.243
When you cried, I came running.

44:16.409 --> 44:20.619
I probably screwed up your love life, too.

44:22.415 --> 44:27.740
But then I think a lot of women
these days are forgoing marriage

44:27.820 --> 44:30.926
in favor of a career, huh?

44:36.362 --> 44:38.569
Adam and I might be getting engaged.

44:39.432 --> 44:42.641
He proposed? Oh, when? Where?

44:42.769 --> 44:46.959
You have to tell me all about it.
We have to have Mario do the cake.

44:47.039 --> 44:50.897
You know, one of those profiterole towers
like he did for Annie Glenn's daughter.

44:50.977 --> 44:54.823
It's nothing official.
I just... I saw the ring in his gym bag.

44:54.914 --> 44:58.259
Well, he's gonna ask you. He's not an idiot.

45:00.186 --> 45:02.462
I always knew you'd get married.

45:02.555 --> 45:05.912
Yeah, and that's why you gave me
wedding china for my birthday.

45:05.992 --> 45:08.438
Well, we both knew that china was a lie.

45:10.163 --> 45:12.166
You'll make such a beautiful bride.

45:13.733 --> 45:16.270
We'll do it at the house
like your father and I did,

45:16.569 --> 45:18.991
with white orchids and moonlight.

45:19.071 --> 45:21.961
It's not official at all,
so you know you can't tell anybody.

45:22.041 --> 45:24.248
I won't. Okay.

45:24.877 --> 45:27.455
- I know you.
- I promise!

45:29.182 --> 45:31.355
- Yes?
- Ms. Berges?

45:31.684 --> 45:34.028
Hi, I have your lunch from Bel-Air Gardens.

45:34.120 --> 45:37.363
- My daughter's getting married.
- Congratulations.

45:37.924 --> 45:38.925
Thank you.

45:47.700 --> 45:50.476
All right. You ready?

45:58.110 --> 45:59.111
I don't hear singing.

46:00.079 --> 46:02.502
You're not going to
because you know I don't sing.

46:02.582 --> 46:04.604
It's not a birthday if there's not singing.

46:04.684 --> 46:07.859
It's for your own protection, my darling.
Now blow out your candle.

46:09.055 --> 46:10.056
Make a wish.

46:10.990 --> 46:11.991
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

46:12.892 --> 46:13.893
Aw.

46:18.231 --> 46:19.232
Happy birthday.

46:22.435 --> 46:23.744
- I love you.
- I love you.

46:30.409 --> 46:31.410
Where's my present?

46:32.712 --> 46:34.453
I was supposed to get you a present?

46:35.882 --> 46:38.070
You are gonna get it.

46:38.150 --> 46:39.686
Didn't I give it to you earlier?

46:40.720 --> 46:41.721
Oh.

46:42.355 --> 46:44.143
Oh, wait!

46:44.223 --> 46:46.799
- I remember where I put it.
- Oh, you do?

46:46.863 --> 46:48.698
- Mmm-hmm. Come here.
- Really?

46:49.796 --> 46:51.297
Come.

46:51.364 --> 46:53.303
Keep your eyes closed.

46:54.533 --> 46:58.276
Eyes closed. Closed, closed, and turn.

46:59.372 --> 47:00.373
Sit.

47:00.806 --> 47:03.810
Do not open your eyes. Okay?

47:05.711 --> 47:07.088
- You ready?
- Okay.

47:07.179 --> 47:10.336
Do not freak out. Do not panic. I have
not forgotten who I fell in love with.

47:10.416 --> 47:11.486
- Open your eyes.
- Okay.

47:14.921 --> 47:17.731
- What's that?
- This is a key to my house.

47:18.090 --> 47:19.729
I'm asking you to move in with me.

47:20.626 --> 47:22.799
- That's my birthday present?
- Not all of it.

47:23.996 --> 47:27.273
I got you an armoire and half a closet.

47:30.736 --> 47:33.159
Just this morning, I told you that I wanted

47:33.239 --> 47:36.311
to spend the rest of my life with you.

47:37.276 --> 47:38.550
You want the whole closet?

47:39.578 --> 47:41.455
Not as roommates.

47:42.448 --> 47:45.104
Marriage? But it's only been a year!

47:45.184 --> 47:48.341
We haven't talked about where we'd want
to live or our priorities for the future.

47:48.421 --> 47:51.744
Stop it! You don't have to do every detail.

47:51.824 --> 47:53.880
But you're the one who said
you never wanted to get married!

47:53.960 --> 47:57.683
- I know what I said.
- Moving in together is a big step.

47:57.763 --> 47:59.709
We'll try it out. We'll see how it goes.

48:03.169 --> 48:04.170
Senna!

48:05.137 --> 48:07.481
Senna, wait a minute! What are you doing?

48:07.907 --> 48:12.049
Senna, wait! Senna, stop! This is crazy!

48:12.211 --> 48:14.667
Oh, I know. I'm the crazy one!

48:14.747 --> 48:17.091
- Baby, you're being irrational.
- Really?

48:17.216 --> 48:20.539
Well, maybe you should go out and find
someone else you can work this out with!

48:20.619 --> 48:23.109
'Cause you know what? I don't
need to be on probation

48:23.189 --> 48:26.045
while you figure out what kind
of relationship you want to have.

48:26.125 --> 48:28.731
Sen, please come back inside.

48:29.729 --> 48:31.971
- You need to turn the key.
- I turned the key!

48:32.498 --> 48:35.206
God damn it! Shit!

48:36.635 --> 48:39.692
What are you doing? What, are you
gonna walk it all the way home?

48:39.772 --> 48:42.912
I had a perfectly good life
before I ever met you,

48:43.109 --> 48:47.421
Mr. "Thanks a Lot for
the Key for My Birthday."

49:10.836 --> 49:12.491
- Senna?
- Go away!

49:12.571 --> 49:14.016
Not until I see you.

49:17.309 --> 49:18.310
Senna!

49:18.811 --> 49:22.435
There, you saw me! Now go away!
God damn it, Adam!

49:22.515 --> 49:24.961
Sen, please. Come on.

49:28.721 --> 49:30.977
- I don't want to talk to you.
- You don't have to talk.

49:31.057 --> 49:32.431
I will do all the talking.

49:33.626 --> 49:35.648
There's something I need
to ask you right this minute.

49:35.728 --> 49:36.729
So ask.

49:37.163 --> 49:38.870
- Can I come in?
- No!

49:40.599 --> 49:41.600
Okay.

49:47.339 --> 49:48.943
- Senna.
- What?

49:49.909 --> 49:50.910
Will you marry me?

49:54.080 --> 49:57.255
- Where'd you get that ring?
- 7-Eleven gumball machine.

50:00.052 --> 50:03.431
- How many tries before you got the ring?
- I don't know.

50:05.991 --> 50:11.317
One, two... Six, seven...

50:11.397 --> 50:14.469
Nine, ten, eleven... Thirteen...

50:15.801 --> 50:16.802
Fourteen.

50:21.807 --> 50:22.808
Ow!

50:24.710 --> 50:27.691
- I prefer the floating eyeball.
- It's yours.

50:29.548 --> 50:32.996
So what do you say? Will you marry me?

50:33.686 --> 50:35.875
You're just asking
'cause you feel bad for me.

50:35.955 --> 50:38.731
Why would I feel bad for you?
You're having a great night.

50:39.091 --> 50:40.400
You got a floating eyeball.

50:42.528 --> 50:45.441
You can't fault me for not knowing
this was important to you.

50:47.233 --> 50:49.406
Even soulmates can't read each other's minds.

50:53.606 --> 50:54.607
So is that a yes?

50:59.145 --> 51:00.419
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

51:07.286 --> 51:09.766
What changed your mind
about wanting to get married?

51:11.657 --> 51:13.034
You did, stupid.

51:24.436 --> 51:27.393
Wishes are a funny thing.
When you wish for something,

51:27.473 --> 51:30.830
you are announcing to the universe
that there is a hole in you

51:30.910 --> 51:32.082
that needs to be filled.

51:33.112 --> 51:36.821
And the more wishes that you make,
the more holes you open up.

51:37.850 --> 51:40.763
There was a time in my life
when I was so full of holes.

51:42.555 --> 51:44.194
I wished for a lot of things.

51:45.491 --> 51:48.336
So this is what I did. I stopped wishing,

51:48.627 --> 51:52.017
and I started saying thank you
for the things I already had.

51:52.097 --> 51:57.046
I started with the big things,
like my friends, my family, my hair.

51:58.270 --> 52:03.618
And there were also little things,
like a smile from a stranger,

52:04.109 --> 52:08.615
a strong cup of coffee, not hitting
one red light on my way home.

52:09.515 --> 52:12.257
Pretty soon, I was so full of gratitude,

52:13.385 --> 52:16.161
there wasn't any room for holes.
I'd crowded them all out.

52:18.557 --> 52:20.298
I don't make birthday wishes.

52:21.460 --> 52:22.962
I want what I got.

53:01.967 --> 53:02.968
Happy birthday.

53:06.639 --> 53:08.360
I keep waiting for her to call.

53:08.440 --> 53:09.441
I know.

53:10.009 --> 53:11.511
She always had to be the first.

53:14.913 --> 53:16.950
You know, when I was in the third grade,

53:19.285 --> 53:21.629
I had a sleepover with Molly Myerson.

53:23.389 --> 53:25.926
She called at 5:00 a.m.,
woke up the whole house.

53:26.125 --> 53:27.331
She wanted to beat Molly.

53:29.561 --> 53:33.407
Let it suffice to say I never had
any more sleepovers on my birthdays.

53:37.369 --> 53:39.508
We argued about profiteroles.

53:42.941 --> 53:45.945
She said profiteroles were inspiring.

53:46.679 --> 53:48.158
I said they were prissy.

53:50.683 --> 53:52.959
I don't even know what a profiterole is.

53:57.823 --> 54:00.360
I insisted we have a winter wedding

54:02.294 --> 54:04.283
because the colors were better!

54:04.363 --> 54:05.637
You had no way of knowing.

54:12.771 --> 54:16.776
- I can't even deal with all this stuff.
- Then let's just toss it.

54:17.276 --> 54:20.086
We'll do it at Steve and Darla's.
Just our closest friends.

54:22.414 --> 54:24.826
I'm leaving for Boston in two weeks.

54:25.984 --> 54:26.985
I just...

54:27.986 --> 54:31.910
Just can't do a whole different
wedding in two weeks!

54:31.990 --> 54:34.698
- Then let me do it.
- Fine.

54:35.361 --> 54:36.362
You do it.

55:14.633 --> 55:15.634
Senna?

55:20.906 --> 55:23.546
She bought me the entire set of china.

55:24.910 --> 55:26.480
All 11 boxes.

55:27.746 --> 55:29.726
I found them in the closet.

55:29.882 --> 55:32.692
Honey, you didn't have to do this today.

55:36.688 --> 55:38.099
What am I gonna do with them?

55:39.525 --> 55:40.936
Well, you could eat off them,

55:41.126 --> 55:43.248
or you can put them behind glass
and just look at them.

55:43.328 --> 55:45.171
That's what Steve and I did with ours.

55:46.932 --> 55:49.242
She was saving them for my wedding.

55:49.735 --> 55:51.476
So we'll save them for your wedding.

55:52.404 --> 55:54.407
If there even is a wedding.

55:55.774 --> 55:59.631
What if I was just doing all
this because she was sick?

55:59.711 --> 56:04.970
No. I saw you the day that
you got engaged, very excited.

56:05.050 --> 56:08.674
I was excited because she was excited.

56:08.754 --> 56:11.997
Mmm. I call bullshit.

56:14.426 --> 56:18.033
- I was kind of excited, too.
- You were a lot excited.

56:19.865 --> 56:22.368
He took the consulting job in Boston.

56:23.335 --> 56:25.791
He's gonna be gone for 10 months.

56:25.871 --> 56:29.027
So he'll visit you here,
and you'll fly over there once in a while.

56:29.107 --> 56:31.383
He asked me how I'd feel
about moving to Boston.

56:32.244 --> 56:34.850
Could you picture me in Boston

56:35.180 --> 56:38.203
and all those... Lawyer dinners?

56:38.283 --> 56:39.284
No.

56:40.252 --> 56:42.341
I don't even exist in Boston.

56:42.421 --> 56:45.425
- So you'll tell him no.
- But he likes it there.

56:45.724 --> 56:47.067
Well, he likes it here, too.

56:49.661 --> 56:53.085
He's probably got some kind of flow chart

56:53.165 --> 56:56.855
with all of the pros on one side
and all the cons on the other side.

56:56.935 --> 56:59.677
Okay, you know what, honey, you are

57:01.173 --> 57:03.915
in it, and that's okay

57:04.576 --> 57:06.453
because you are gonna get through this.

57:15.521 --> 57:17.433
- Hey.
- Hey.

57:21.426 --> 57:23.702
- What's with the suitcases?
- I packed for you.

57:24.696 --> 57:27.905
- I think I did a very good job.
- Where are we going?

57:29.334 --> 57:31.256
- Vegas!
- Vegas?

57:31.336 --> 57:32.337
Yeah.

57:33.205 --> 57:34.309
Dinner at the Bellagio.

57:35.607 --> 57:37.052
And a show at Caesar's Palace.

57:37.976 --> 57:39.615
- And then...
- And then?

57:40.312 --> 57:42.258
Because I want your 50th to be special,

57:43.115 --> 57:47.587
really, really, really, really special,

57:48.720 --> 57:50.529
- know what I did?
- No.

57:54.793 --> 57:55.794
I...

57:56.929 --> 57:59.000
booked a chapel for midnight,

57:59.464 --> 58:01.954
so that our anniversary never falls
on the same day as your birthday.

58:02.034 --> 58:04.708
And I promise you will always
get two separate presents.

58:05.771 --> 58:08.060
I know Vegas is kitschy,
but we've been wanting to go.

58:08.140 --> 58:10.562
For fun, not to get married.

58:10.642 --> 58:15.023
This wedding planning is killing us!
Let's just get it over with.

58:16.882 --> 58:18.953
- Get it over with?
- You know what I mean.

58:19.718 --> 58:20.719
No.

58:22.387 --> 58:23.661
I'm not certain that I do.

58:24.056 --> 58:27.003
I mean, if you want to do it,
let's do it already!

58:29.394 --> 58:32.534
- You do still want to marry me?
- Not when you're acting like this.

58:33.632 --> 58:35.554
I'm sorry. How would you like me to act?

58:35.634 --> 58:37.422
Oh, I don't know.
A little bit less like an asshole.

58:37.502 --> 58:38.891
You're the one who keeps putting this off.

58:38.971 --> 58:42.361
We agreed when I took the job in Boston
that we'd do this before I left.

58:42.441 --> 58:46.932
Well, I don't want to get married at
a chapel that you picked off the Internet.

58:47.012 --> 58:48.700
You didn't want to get married
at the Bel-Air Club.

58:48.780 --> 58:50.369
You didn't want to get married
at the Chateau.

58:50.449 --> 58:52.471
You didn't want to get married
at Steve and Darla's.

58:52.551 --> 58:55.374
- Why are you pressuring me?
- Because we had a plan, Sen,

58:55.454 --> 58:57.058
and I put my whole heart into it.

58:58.156 --> 58:59.999
If you're backing out, I need to know.

59:05.931 --> 59:06.932
Oh.

59:14.406 --> 59:15.407
What are you doing?

59:19.578 --> 59:23.788
I really, really wanted
to share my life with you,

59:25.050 --> 59:27.929
but all you do is put up walls,
and I can't take it anymore.

59:29.021 --> 59:31.524
- So you're going without me?
- I paid for the room.

59:32.357 --> 59:34.746
Vegas is just as fun for singles,
or so I've heard.

59:34.826 --> 59:36.032
Oh, so now you're single?

59:36.828 --> 59:37.829
Aren't I?

59:38.597 --> 59:41.737
I mean, isn't that what you wanted,
for me to stop pressuring you?

59:42.167 --> 59:44.579
Guess what, babe? Pressure's off.

59:52.277 --> 59:53.916
<i>Last birthday, I was still with Senna.</i>

59:54.646 --> 59:56.468
I guess you'd call it the honeymoon period.

59:56.548 --> 59:58.619
She wouldn't let me out of bed
the whole morning.

59:59.484 --> 01:00:02.007
I was late to my deposition.
I never got breakfast,

01:00:02.087 --> 01:00:03.691
and then we worked through lunch.

01:00:04.856 --> 01:00:05.857
When I got home,

01:00:06.992 --> 01:00:10.015
she'd hidden all these little presents
around the house, like a treasure hunt

01:00:10.095 --> 01:00:12.718
with funny little poems for clues.

01:00:12.798 --> 01:00:14.334
The last present was in the bed.

01:00:16.601 --> 01:00:18.774
I'm not going to tell you what it was,

01:00:20.939 --> 01:00:22.441
but we never made it to dinner.

01:00:23.642 --> 01:00:27.146
I didn't have a meal the entire day.
I think I wished for a cheeseburger.

01:00:29.981 --> 01:00:30.982
This year?

01:00:33.518 --> 01:00:36.192
Look, if I thought it could
work, I'd still be with her.

01:00:37.255 --> 01:00:39.011
I do not wish for her back.

01:00:39.091 --> 01:00:40.695
It was exhausting being with her.

01:00:44.029 --> 01:00:45.804
I wish I would feel that way again,

01:00:47.599 --> 01:00:49.272
the way I felt when I was with her,

01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:52.540
but with someone else.

01:01:12.424 --> 01:01:14.597
Thank you, Jack. The usual.

01:01:58.804 --> 01:02:02.377
The samples from Hong Kong shipped
today, and you got some flowers.

01:02:02.674 --> 01:02:03.662
From who?

01:02:03.742 --> 01:02:05.230
"My wife loves her coat.

01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:09.281
"I'd love to speak with you
about bringing your line to Paris."

01:02:10.415 --> 01:02:13.760
Paris? Oh, my God!
We are going international!

01:02:14.019 --> 01:02:16.494
My God, my coats are going to France!

01:02:19.624 --> 01:02:21.313
Okay, so wait.
Where are you going to celebrate?

01:02:21.393 --> 01:02:22.647
Darla makes all the plans.

01:02:22.727 --> 01:02:24.983
Call Darla! You've got to celebrate!
I'm coming.

01:02:25.063 --> 01:02:26.667
Celebrate! Now! Call!

01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:38.988
You look so hot! Yeah!

01:02:39.344 --> 01:02:42.655
Okay, I'm gonna go check on the table.
You need to check out the bar.

01:02:51.323 --> 01:02:54.346
- Hey, nice art.
- Thanks.

01:02:54.426 --> 01:02:56.702
- Why a dragonfly?
- I don't know.

01:02:57.062 --> 01:02:58.405
I've got one on my shoulder.

01:02:59.598 --> 01:03:02.636
I couldn't decide what color,
so I picked clear.

01:03:03.368 --> 01:03:04.369
That's a joke, right?

01:03:08.273 --> 01:03:09.274
Yeah.

01:03:11.643 --> 01:03:12.644
You wanna dance?

01:03:13.378 --> 01:03:15.221
No, I have a clubfoot.

01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:20.495
<i>We got you a little something,
and I hope you like it.</i>

01:03:22.621 --> 01:03:27.179
- Yay!
- You guys! Come on.

01:03:27.259 --> 01:03:29.205
- You look so pretty!
- Are you kidding me?

01:03:29.527 --> 01:03:30.982
- Beautiful.
- Right?

01:03:31.062 --> 01:03:34.066
- Thank you. You're the best.
- You're welcome. You're welcome.

01:03:34.733 --> 01:03:37.076
Oh, look what the cat dragged in all late!

01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:42.194
What's up? I left my child with a stripper,
but you're worth it.

01:03:42.274 --> 01:03:44.516
Happy birthday! Hold this.

01:03:45.543 --> 01:03:46.988
- Thank you.
- I'm so excited.

01:03:47.913 --> 01:03:49.415
Drum roll, please.

01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:53.471
Oh, no!

01:03:53.551 --> 01:03:54.791
Ta-da.

01:03:55.086 --> 01:03:57.509
You can't give me something that's alive.

01:03:57.589 --> 01:04:00.579
- But I just did, though.
- Come on, you guys. We've got to go dance!

01:04:00.659 --> 01:04:01.847
Come on! I'm gonna leave this here.

01:04:01.927 --> 01:04:03.148
- Okay.
- I'm so excited.

01:04:03.228 --> 01:04:05.071
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

01:04:16.207 --> 01:04:18.763
This can't be good for the dog.

01:04:19.711 --> 01:04:23.586
There goes my phone. Hold on.

01:04:23.915 --> 01:04:26.938
Hello? Stop licking my face. Stop licking me.

01:04:27.018 --> 01:04:29.863
- <i>Senna? Hi, is this a bad time?</i>
- Adam!

01:04:30.155 --> 01:04:33.845
Hi. This place is a little noisy. I just...

01:04:33.925 --> 01:04:36.235
I'll get out of here. Just hold on a second.

01:04:36.728 --> 01:04:39.217
- Hi.
- <i>Hi. Sorry to call so late.</i>

01:04:39.297 --> 01:04:40.719
<i>I just want to wish you a happy birthday.</i>

01:04:40.799 --> 01:04:42.954
You know, we just got here. It's still early.

01:04:43.034 --> 01:04:44.022
You can come by.

01:04:44.102 --> 01:04:47.626
- <i>Senna? Senna, can you hear me?</i>
- Adam?

01:04:47.706 --> 01:04:50.595
- <i>Sorry, I'm losing you.</i>
- Adam, we're still here.

01:04:50.675 --> 01:04:51.676
- You could...
- <i>Senna?</i>

01:04:53.712 --> 01:04:54.713
You could...

01:04:55.447 --> 01:04:57.427
Aw... Can I?

01:04:58.116 --> 01:05:03.430
Oh... Oh, she does not like
the club scene at all.

01:05:04.489 --> 01:05:05.934
- Who are you calling?
- Adam.

01:05:06.424 --> 01:05:08.700
I was just talking to him.
We got cut off and...

01:05:09.094 --> 01:05:11.836
<i>Hey, it's Adam.
Leave a message so I can call you back.</i>

01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:15.407
His phone is turned off. It's so weird.

01:05:15.734 --> 01:05:18.056
- We were just talking like one second ago.
- Okay.

01:05:18.136 --> 01:05:19.124
- We just got cut off.
- I have to tell you something.

01:05:19.204 --> 01:05:20.258
- I was already talking to him.
- Hang up. Hang up.

01:05:20.338 --> 01:05:22.994
Don't call him again.
I have to tell you... Hang up!

01:05:23.074 --> 01:05:26.364
I have to tell you something.
I was supposed to tell you before today,

01:05:26.444 --> 01:05:28.967
but your birthday was coming up,
so I decided not to.

01:05:29.047 --> 01:05:31.425
And then I just forgot, and so...

01:05:32.984 --> 01:05:33.985
What?

01:05:34.652 --> 01:05:38.797
Adam was seeing this girl when he was is
Boston, but I didn't think It was a big deal.

01:05:39.591 --> 01:05:43.095
But apparently she's moved
to LA to be with him.

01:05:43.528 --> 01:05:45.667
I'm sorry, honey. I should've told you.

01:05:46.431 --> 01:05:49.310
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:05:53.938 --> 01:05:56.783
<i>It's Adam. Leave me a message
so I can call you back.</i>

01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:00.046
Hey, it's Senna.

01:06:01.279 --> 01:06:04.658
Um... Darla told me that you

01:06:05.817 --> 01:06:09.765
moved out here with your girlfriend,
and I'm just... I'm really happy for you.

01:06:10.855 --> 01:06:11.856
Um...

01:06:13.224 --> 01:06:16.205
So, if you want to get together as friends,

01:06:17.162 --> 01:06:18.163
just call me.

01:06:19.731 --> 01:06:20.732
Okay.

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:32.513
Every year until I turned 15,
I am sure I wished for a horse.

01:06:33.745 --> 01:06:34.746
What a waste.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.355
And then, once I got into high school,
I started wishing to get into Stanford.

01:06:39.584 --> 01:06:40.585
Go Trees!

01:06:41.419 --> 01:06:45.231
In college, you wish for good grades
and then a good job.

01:06:46.057 --> 01:06:47.058
But now?

01:06:47.992 --> 01:06:52.517
Well, things and accomplishments
don't mean anything

01:06:52.597 --> 01:06:54.634
unless you have someone to share them with.

01:06:56.401 --> 01:06:58.176
Other than that whole horse period,

01:06:59.604 --> 01:07:02.744
I would say I'm doing
pretty well on the wish front.

01:07:11.716 --> 01:07:14.754
Senna, she's here. Shall I rally the troops?

01:07:23.294 --> 01:07:24.295
Okay, Squeak.

01:07:27.365 --> 01:07:30.744
Ladies. Everybody gather around.
We're going to have a couple of words.

01:07:33.238 --> 01:07:35.582
Okay. Good morning, everybody.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:40.298
As you know, I sold the shop
because I'll be moving to Paris

01:07:40.378 --> 01:07:43.723
where I'll be designing. Yay!

01:07:44.516 --> 01:07:49.192
I'd like you to meet the woman
who got me started in this business.

01:07:49.954 --> 01:07:52.161
Your new boss, Vanessa.

01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:55.213
Thank you. I just want to tell you

01:07:55.293 --> 01:07:57.830
how much I'm looking forward
to working with you all.

01:07:58.096 --> 01:07:59.871
Senna's built an incredible business.

01:08:00.532 --> 01:08:03.741
A bit of a late bloomer, but worth the wait.

01:08:04.102 --> 01:08:06.309
And I'm honored she's handing
the torch to me.

01:08:06.538 --> 01:08:07.539
Make us proud.

01:08:08.907 --> 01:08:09.908
You bet.

01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:13.912
Mommy's phone.

01:08:19.783 --> 01:08:22.321
- Hello.
- <i>Congratulations. You're a free woman.</i>

01:08:22.886 --> 01:08:24.209
Yes, I did it.

01:08:24.288 --> 01:08:26.778
<i>Let's go celebrate your last birthday in LA</i>

01:08:26.858 --> 01:08:30.203
- <i>by doing something really Californian.</i>
- Like what?

01:08:30.694 --> 01:08:32.649
Beach volleyball!

01:08:34.432 --> 01:08:36.421
Beach volleyball!

01:08:36.501 --> 01:08:39.357
I knew you'd be so happy.
It's a great idea, right?

01:08:39.437 --> 01:08:41.859
- Yeah!
- Too bad all the courts are taken.

01:08:41.939 --> 01:08:43.895
We're just gonna have to nap it up.

01:08:43.975 --> 01:08:46.683
No, that's Alison.
She's holding the second one. Come on.

01:08:47.212 --> 01:08:48.433
You knew about this, didn't you?

01:08:48.513 --> 01:08:50.033
I did, but we don't have to play.

01:08:50.113 --> 01:08:54.586
Yeah, and you let me wear my bikini
when you knew the thing was gonna be here.

01:08:54.953 --> 01:08:57.263
Let me tell you, my boobs pop out...

01:08:59.890 --> 01:09:02.080
Hey, guys! Birthday girl!

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:05.884
Oh, you are very brave in this outfit. Hi.

01:09:05.964 --> 01:09:08.252
- All right, sunscreen, sunscreen?
- No, thank you.

01:09:08.332 --> 01:09:09.334
Here.

01:09:10.268 --> 01:09:12.023
I got really badly burned sailing one time

01:09:12.103 --> 01:09:14.591
so now I always bring enough
to share. Keep it.

01:09:14.671 --> 01:09:16.810
And I brought something for you, too.

01:09:17.242 --> 01:09:21.554
Whoa, look! Hey, Stevie,
wanna build a sand city?

01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:23.201
- Yeah!
- Yeah? Okay.

01:09:23.281 --> 01:09:24.602
Bye, baby. Go, go, go.

01:09:24.682 --> 01:09:27.104
- Have fun, Stevie.
- So nice. You didn't have to do that.

01:09:27.185 --> 01:09:30.008
Oh. It's nothing.
I used to summer in Nantucket,

01:09:30.087 --> 01:09:32.343
and me and my brothers used to
build these huge sand castles

01:09:32.423 --> 01:09:35.404
and pretend we lived in them.
It was so much fun.

01:09:36.227 --> 01:09:38.917
Anyway, very impressed
you guys are game to play.

01:09:38.997 --> 01:09:42.706
Yeah, well, you know, we haven't
been put out to pasture just yet.

01:09:43.067 --> 01:09:44.376
- Let's do it.
- All right.

01:09:47.071 --> 01:09:48.072
Get it, Sen!

01:09:49.874 --> 01:09:51.796
- Senna, you okay?
- God, you okay?

01:09:51.876 --> 01:09:53.219
- That had to hurt. You all right?
- You all right?

01:09:53.344 --> 01:09:56.000
- Here, let me help you up.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, great.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.389
You know, volleyball

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:04.199
and full body exfoliation
on the same day, it's perfect.

01:10:04.689 --> 01:10:05.677
Your serve.

01:10:05.757 --> 01:10:07.566
- Come on. Let's go.
- Come on, Senna!

01:10:08.526 --> 01:10:09.527
Damn it!

01:10:11.462 --> 01:10:14.085
- I got it! I got it!
- Get it! Get it! Get it!

01:10:14.165 --> 01:10:15.166
Okay, come on!

01:10:19.804 --> 01:10:21.943
- Up there.
- You got it. All right.

01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:27.111
You got it, girl!

01:10:27.745 --> 01:10:28.746
Yeah!

01:10:29.147 --> 01:10:30.353
No problem.

01:10:34.018 --> 01:10:35.190
- I got it.
- There you go.

01:10:37.121 --> 01:10:39.192
Get it. Get it. Hit it. Hit it!

01:10:43.328 --> 01:10:46.184
Is it just me, people, or do you think
maybe it wasn't just Adam

01:10:46.264 --> 01:10:48.005
who picked volleyball today?

01:10:52.036 --> 01:10:54.539
There you are! Ready to go?

01:10:54.806 --> 01:10:57.480
- Already?
- We have to bring Stevie and Cameron home.

01:10:57.709 --> 01:11:00.690
Oh, I was hoping we could stay
and watch the sun set.

01:11:00.845 --> 01:11:02.467
Well, I don't mind staying a little longer.

01:11:02.547 --> 01:11:05.003
We have a reservation at 7:00.
I need to get ready.

01:11:05.083 --> 01:11:07.639
Oh, well, we can drop you off.
You're like five minutes from us.

01:11:07.719 --> 01:11:11.098
- And then you ride with Adam?
- Is that okay with you?

01:11:13.624 --> 01:11:15.866
All right. See you later, birthday girl.

01:11:16.027 --> 01:11:18.200
Okay. Bye, big man.

01:11:27.505 --> 01:11:29.178
I'm really gonna miss this.

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.483
Yup. Paris is gonna suck.

01:11:33.111 --> 01:11:34.799
You gonna make all your models wear, like,

01:11:34.879 --> 01:11:37.869
10-foot-tall hats made out of
feathers and old car parts?

01:11:37.949 --> 01:11:41.973
I was thinking more like faux fur
with big tree branches

01:11:42.053 --> 01:11:45.125
- sticking out of their heads.
- Oh, yeah, I totally feel that one.

01:11:47.992 --> 01:11:50.281
Just make sure, when you become
a big fashion designer,

01:11:50.361 --> 01:11:53.274
you don't forget all the little people
you left behind, okay?

01:11:59.137 --> 01:12:00.810
You're really digging in here, huh?

01:12:06.477 --> 01:12:08.013
We can't all have Paris.

01:14:02.326 --> 01:14:04.101
Come on! Come on! Open!

01:14:11.869 --> 01:14:12.870
Come on!

01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:20.811
Okay.

01:14:29.353 --> 01:14:30.889
Senna!

01:14:31.989 --> 01:14:33.764
I'm having a little problem!

01:14:38.195 --> 01:14:39.538
Oh, my God.

01:14:39.664 --> 01:14:42.440
Can you get your ass
over here quickly, please?

01:14:44.869 --> 01:14:46.657
I somehow locked the trunk.

01:14:46.737 --> 01:14:51.080
Would you please open the door and just pull
the thing on the side of the steering wheel?

01:14:57.848 --> 01:14:58.849
You're not serious.

01:15:02.286 --> 01:15:03.287
This is really bad.

01:15:04.188 --> 01:15:05.633
All right, give me your phone.

01:15:05.723 --> 01:15:07.645
Get your phone out of the bag
and give it to me.

01:15:07.725 --> 01:15:10.331
We're supposed to meet them
in, like, 20 minutes.

01:15:11.028 --> 01:15:12.302
You don't have your phone?

01:15:14.999 --> 01:15:17.741
Are you kidding me?
You know where my phone is?

01:15:18.102 --> 01:15:19.775
It's right there!

01:15:20.538 --> 01:15:23.678
Okay, what are we going to do?
We need to find a phone.

01:15:24.375 --> 01:15:26.287
We need to find a phone!

01:15:28.245 --> 01:15:32.717
Senna, stop! I'm stark naked!
What am I gonna do?

01:15:33.384 --> 01:15:36.607
<i>Come on, Eileen, please</i>

01:15:36.687 --> 01:15:38.342
<i>Everybody do my part!</i>

01:15:38.422 --> 01:15:42.200
<i>Come on, Eileen...</i>

01:15:52.637 --> 01:15:53.911
Are my balls sticking out?

01:15:54.772 --> 01:15:57.252
- Define "sticking out."
- Can you see them?

01:15:58.142 --> 01:16:00.987
- Depends on where you're looking.
- Nice.

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.002
How's it going? How are you?

01:16:05.082 --> 01:16:07.790
Oh, my goodness.

01:16:08.052 --> 01:16:10.362
- He's good.
- It's karaoke night.

01:16:11.722 --> 01:16:13.725
- <i>I almost got the note!</i>
- Love that song.

01:16:14.525 --> 01:16:18.416
Hey, man, I locked my keys
in my car across the street.

01:16:18.496 --> 01:16:20.151
Could I possibly use your phone?

01:16:20.231 --> 01:16:22.677
- Sure, buddy.
- Thanks, man, I appreciate it.

01:16:25.469 --> 01:16:26.470
I'll be right back.

01:16:27.271 --> 01:16:29.114
Hey, Ali, it's me.

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:32.597
<i>Come on, Eileen, oh, I swear what I mean</i>

01:16:32.677 --> 01:16:36.300
<i>In that moment you mean everything</i>

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:38.451
- Can I leave my bag?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:16:40.551 --> 01:16:42.807
<i>Well, they're dirty</i>

01:16:42.887 --> 01:16:45.493
<i>Come on, Eileen</i>

01:16:45.856 --> 01:16:48.579
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa Backup! Whoa, whoa, whoa...</i>

01:16:48.659 --> 01:16:50.639
<i>Everybody!</i>

01:16:50.761 --> 01:16:51.762
<i>Whoa</i>

01:16:52.363 --> 01:16:53.364
<i>Okay, do it again!</i>

01:16:53.998 --> 01:16:54.999
<i>Whoa</i>

01:16:55.833 --> 01:16:59.679
There you are! I thought
maybe you took off with Eileen.

01:16:59.870 --> 01:17:01.850
Well, the night is young.

01:17:02.973 --> 01:17:06.263
<i>All right, all right, all right.
Jody was supposed to be up next,</i>

01:17:06.343 --> 01:17:08.799
<i>but we have a birthday in the house,</i>

01:17:08.879 --> 01:17:11.335
<i>and our birthday girl
wants her special friend</i>

01:17:11.415 --> 01:17:14.726
<i>to be allowed to come up here
and sing her a song. What do y'all say?</i>

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:19.593
<i>All right, so let's give a big hand to Adam!
Where's Adam?</i>

01:17:20.224 --> 01:17:24.915
<i>To Adam as he serenades his birthday girl!
Come on up, Adam!</i>

01:17:24.995 --> 01:17:26.998
- No! No, that's not gonna happen!
- Adam!

01:17:27.465 --> 01:17:29.153
Adam! Adam! Adam!

01:17:29.233 --> 01:17:33.024
I do not do that. I don't do it.
You don't want to hear it.

01:17:33.104 --> 01:17:35.346
- Adam! Adam! Adam!
- Hilarious!

01:17:35.573 --> 01:17:38.713
- <i>Come on, Adam, we don't bite! Come on!</i>
- You want me to do this?

01:17:40.845 --> 01:17:41.846
You bitch.

01:17:48.119 --> 01:17:50.207
Dude, I hope you sing better than you dress!

01:17:50.287 --> 01:17:53.097
- I don't. I'm worse.
- You hear this guy?

01:17:53.324 --> 01:17:55.895
- All right! Take the stage.
- <i>Forgive my wardrobe. It's a long story.</i>

01:17:56.393 --> 01:17:58.382
- Looking great. You're looking great.
- <i>What do I do?</i>

01:17:58.462 --> 01:17:59.532
Oh, that was your cue!

01:17:59.797 --> 01:18:01.834
<i>How have you been?</i>

01:18:02.299 --> 01:18:03.300
Come on! Come on!

01:18:03.734 --> 01:18:06.271
<i>Changed your style?</i>

01:18:06.704 --> 01:18:09.026
- You do not want me to sing.
- No, no, no, you're doing great.

01:18:09.106 --> 01:18:10.661
- Please, I don't wanna do this.
- You're doing great.

01:18:10.741 --> 01:18:13.297
- Come on, just keep singing.
- Please! I swear to God, I don't do this.

01:18:13.377 --> 01:18:16.300
<i>Don't seem the same
Seems you've lost your feel</i>

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:17.768
I don't do this. This is just not my thing.

01:18:17.848 --> 01:18:19.904
Come on, join me! Let's do it together.

01:18:19.984 --> 01:18:21.405
<i>You're all being really nice
in a mean sort of way.</i>

01:18:21.485 --> 01:18:23.897
Let's do it. Let's do it.
You're doing great. Just follow along.

01:18:24.054 --> 01:18:26.677
<i>So let's leave it alone</i>

01:18:26.757 --> 01:18:28.379
<i>I'm going to kick your ass!</i>

01:18:28.459 --> 01:18:31.201
Come on, finish it. For your birthday girl.

01:18:31.762 --> 01:18:32.763
Seriously.

01:18:37.368 --> 01:18:41.578
<i>There's only you and me and we just disagree</i>

01:18:43.574 --> 01:18:48.888
<i>Oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh</i>

01:18:52.283 --> 01:18:53.270
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:55.589
<i>There's more where that came from!</i>

01:18:58.622 --> 01:19:00.499
<i>I'm going away</i>

01:19:02.393 --> 01:19:04.839
<i>Back to a place that's far away</i>

01:19:05.696 --> 01:19:06.684
<i>How about you?</i>

01:19:06.764 --> 01:19:07.868
Maybe Paris, huh?

01:19:08.532 --> 01:19:10.671
<i>Have you got a place to stay?</i>

01:19:11.268 --> 01:19:12.941
<i>Why should I care?</i>

01:19:13.571 --> 01:19:16.609
<i>Look at me. I'm just trying
to get along, all right?</i>

01:19:17.474 --> 01:19:19.347
<i>We were friends</i>

01:19:21.011 --> 01:19:25.517
<i>And now it's the end of our love song</i>

01:19:29.286 --> 01:19:32.426
<i>So let's leave it alone</i>

01:19:33.858 --> 01:19:36.668
<i>'Cause we can't see eye to eye</i>

01:19:37.328 --> 01:19:39.774
<i>There ain't no good guy</i>

01:19:39.964 --> 01:19:42.720
<i>There ain't no bad guy</i>

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:47.545
<i>There's only you and me and we just disagree</i>

01:19:49.473 --> 01:19:52.613
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:56.858
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

01:19:58.148 --> 01:20:00.287
- Yeah!
- You happy?

01:20:01.819 --> 01:20:03.628
Well, happy birthday.

01:20:04.989 --> 01:20:07.526
- Adam?
- Alison! Hey, guys.

01:20:07.825 --> 01:20:11.215
- Hi.
- I locked my clothes in the car.

01:20:11.295 --> 01:20:14.140
Hey, Hoss. From the gals down the end

01:20:14.598 --> 01:20:18.307
in appreciation of your
inspired vocal performance.

01:20:18.502 --> 01:20:19.503
- You sang?
- You sang?

01:20:20.604 --> 01:20:22.777
- You told me you were tone-deaf.
- Oh, he is.

01:20:24.742 --> 01:20:27.264
Um, I brought you a spare key.
You can change in the car.

01:20:27.344 --> 01:20:28.599
- Thanks.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:20:28.679 --> 01:20:31.524
We can't let a free pitcher
of beer go to waste.

01:20:31.916 --> 01:20:34.726
And look! A table opened up. Come on.

01:20:35.152 --> 01:20:36.153
Hmm.

01:20:40.057 --> 01:20:41.627
Thanks. I'll go change.

01:20:45.262 --> 01:20:46.673
<i>I got you a little something.</i>

01:20:47.064 --> 01:20:48.052
Oh.

01:20:48.132 --> 01:20:50.908
I spent my junior year in Paris,
and I love the city.

01:20:51.235 --> 01:20:54.648
They really know how to live there.
You may never come back.

01:20:57.408 --> 01:20:59.897
- What are you doing, Darla?
- We're gonna play a game.

01:20:59.977 --> 01:21:03.000
It's called "Never have I ever."
It's really simple.

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:06.619
We go around in a circle,
and when it's your turn, you say

01:21:06.917 --> 01:21:10.241
something that you've never done,
like, "I've never driven a Ferrari."

01:21:10.321 --> 01:21:13.510
And if someone else in the circle has,
they hand you a match.

01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:16.901
And whoever has all the matches
at the end of the game is the winner.

01:21:17.061 --> 01:21:18.249
What do we get if we win?

01:21:18.329 --> 01:21:20.366
- You're not gonna win so I wouldn't worry.
- She always wins.

01:21:20.965 --> 01:21:22.911
All right, I'll start.

01:21:23.133 --> 01:21:24.703
I have never been to Paris.

01:21:25.736 --> 01:21:27.978
- So I give you that.
- Yes. Thank you.

01:21:28.138 --> 01:21:30.380
- Steve, you go.
- I have, um,

01:21:32.276 --> 01:21:35.966
- never been to a nudie beach.
- Oh, good one, Steve!

01:21:36.046 --> 01:21:38.369
We went on this corporate
retreat in Saint Barts.

01:21:38.449 --> 01:21:39.436
It was so awful!

01:21:39.516 --> 01:21:42.740
- Darla instantly ripped her clothes off.
- That's not true!

01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:45.409
We all just had to take pictures.
We were embarrassed for her.

01:21:45.489 --> 01:21:47.711
Oh, my God! You've seen
everybody at this table naked.

01:21:47.791 --> 01:21:49.179
That's an accomplishment, my friend.

01:21:49.259 --> 01:21:51.136
- Thank you for sharing that, Darla.
- Yeah. You're welcome.

01:21:51.628 --> 01:21:52.698
Wait.

01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:56.153
- Steve? You've seen Steve naked?
- I steam after racquetball.

01:21:56.233 --> 01:21:58.611
That's true. We like to do that.

01:21:59.336 --> 01:22:00.576
All right, it's your turn.

01:22:01.305 --> 01:22:05.583
Oh, I have never, ever locked
my keys in my car.

01:22:06.810 --> 01:22:11.936
- You are a perfect person.
- Well, I wouldn't say perfect, but...

01:22:12.016 --> 01:22:13.017
Yes, I would.

01:22:16.086 --> 01:22:18.999
- Adam?
- Okay, I have

01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:22.002
never seen <i>Gone with the Wind.</i>

01:22:23.527 --> 01:22:25.716
None of you at this table have seen
<i>Gone with the Wind?</i>

01:22:25.796 --> 01:22:28.385
- I saw, like, half.
- What's the matter with you people?

01:22:28.465 --> 01:22:29.466
Okay, your turn.

01:22:30.868 --> 01:22:34.247
I have never had sex with a woman.

01:22:34.671 --> 01:22:35.672
Okay.

01:22:35.906 --> 01:22:38.595
- You're killing me.
- Darla! You're the adventurous one.

01:22:38.675 --> 01:22:41.699
- Yeah, yeah, let's all discuss it.
- Okay.

01:22:41.779 --> 01:22:44.624
No, that was a joke. Thank you, Senna.

01:22:44.848 --> 01:22:45.849
Okay, it's my turn.

01:22:46.984 --> 01:22:49.726
I have never been to Vegas.

01:22:50.621 --> 01:22:53.101
- Yeah, well, there goes mine.
- Anybody else?

01:22:53.257 --> 01:22:57.069
Give him your match,
Mr. "I'm Single, I've Got a Ticket."

01:22:57.161 --> 01:22:58.162
I didn't go.

01:22:59.329 --> 01:23:04.210
I had tickets... A ticket once for a trip
to Vegas. Never got on the plane.

01:23:05.903 --> 01:23:08.892
- They were going to elope.
- She knows we were engaged, Darla.

01:23:08.972 --> 01:23:12.249
I was engaged once, too.
My high school quarterback.

01:23:12.543 --> 01:23:13.817
Ooh, we all make mistakes.

01:23:15.312 --> 01:23:17.815
- I think it's your turn.
- Mine? Oh.

01:23:20.451 --> 01:23:22.260
I have never smoked pot.

01:23:23.187 --> 01:23:24.188
Ooh!

01:23:25.122 --> 01:23:27.044
- Strategical.
- You know what?

01:23:27.124 --> 01:23:28.626
I should probably give you two.

01:23:30.327 --> 01:23:32.933
- All right. Adam?
- Okay.

01:23:34.431 --> 01:23:35.432
I...

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:40.524
have never intentionally humiliated a friend
in front of a crowd of rowdy cowboys.

01:23:40.604 --> 01:23:43.676
Oh, you loved every minute of it.

01:23:45.242 --> 01:23:46.243
We all did.

01:23:47.377 --> 01:23:48.378
Give me my match.

01:23:51.682 --> 01:23:52.683
Okay.

01:23:53.484 --> 01:23:54.485
It's your turn.

01:24:09.133 --> 01:24:11.704
I've never loved any man but Adam,

01:24:14.738 --> 01:24:16.479
and I don't think I ever will.

01:24:21.778 --> 01:24:24.268
We may have seen each other naked,
but that's the extent of it.

01:24:24.348 --> 01:24:26.123
I think I've had enough of this game.

01:24:44.935 --> 01:24:46.847
I mean, I know it's her birthday,

01:24:48.372 --> 01:24:49.373
but she had no right.

01:24:51.408 --> 01:24:53.047
That was completely inappropriate.

01:25:03.787 --> 01:25:04.788
What are you doing?

01:25:07.891 --> 01:25:08.892
Adam.

01:25:15.499 --> 01:25:16.500
I'm sorry.

01:25:19.570 --> 01:25:20.776
Adam, what are you doing?

01:25:21.638 --> 01:25:23.880
Where are you going? Adam!

01:25:29.513 --> 01:25:32.221
I don't know whether to hug you
or punch you in the face.

01:25:32.316 --> 01:25:33.317
Adam!

01:25:36.286 --> 01:25:38.926
- Where's Alison?
- I left her on the side of the road.

01:25:40.090 --> 01:25:41.296
- What?
- In the car!

01:25:41.391 --> 01:25:42.995
Don't worry. She's not gonna die.

01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:44.261
She might kill me.

01:25:46.597 --> 01:25:47.598
Sorry about that?

01:25:47.731 --> 01:25:51.543
"I've never loved any other man,
and I don't think I ever will"?

01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:55.474
Isn't that a little melodramatic?

01:25:55.939 --> 01:25:59.250
- I'm a little melodramatic.
- So, you didn't mean it?

01:26:00.143 --> 01:26:01.932
No, I meant it, absolutely.

01:26:02.012 --> 01:26:06.222
I'm in a relationship with Alison.
She moved here to be with me.

01:26:07.384 --> 01:26:10.240
- So?
- I don't feel the same way about her

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:11.321
as I do about you!

01:26:16.927 --> 01:26:17.928
So...

01:26:26.937 --> 01:26:30.316
- You'll meet somebody else.
- Oh, would you stop it already with that!

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.163
What, you want me to admit I was wrong?
Okay, I was wrong!

01:26:33.243 --> 01:26:36.713
I thought there'd be five or three
or at least one other, but guess what.

01:26:37.314 --> 01:26:41.319
I obviously don't feel that way anymore
because here I am with you!

01:26:41.985 --> 01:26:46.161
The problem is, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do about that!

01:26:47.424 --> 01:26:48.425
Marry me.

01:26:51.928 --> 01:26:54.534
- You're not serious.
- Hey, I took a knee here.

01:27:07.377 --> 01:27:08.378
Is that a yes?

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:11.081
Yes.

01:27:14.584 --> 01:27:16.962
- Once again, I don't have a ring.
- I don't care.

01:27:31.401 --> 01:27:33.210
Can I ask you something?

01:27:34.304 --> 01:27:35.305
Anything.

01:27:36.106 --> 01:27:40.452
What changed your mind
about there being only one?

01:27:41.778 --> 01:27:43.451
You did, stupid.

01:27:51.855 --> 01:27:55.200
<i>I have wished for the same thing
since I was 10 years old.</i>

01:27:56.059 --> 01:28:00.940
I just kind of closed my eyes and imagined,

01:28:01.898 --> 01:28:05.311
I guess you'd call it, a moment.

01:28:06.703 --> 01:28:12.517
A moment where all
of my screw-ups and heartaches

01:28:13.944 --> 01:28:16.600
would just kind of fade into the background

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:20.025
and who I was meant to be would emerge.

01:28:24.354 --> 01:28:25.993
I got my moment.

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:39.142
- Olga! Where's Olga?
- I don't know!

01:28:39.403 --> 01:28:42.248
Help me find Olga,
or I will have a heart attack!

01:28:42.372 --> 01:28:44.761
- Olga? Where's Olga?
- Come on!

01:28:44.841 --> 01:28:47.151
- I need to find Olga!
- Come on, sweetie.

01:28:47.344 --> 01:28:48.345
This hat.

01:28:49.413 --> 01:28:53.486
Gorgeous. Okay, smile. Out there. Okay, go.

01:28:54.084 --> 01:28:56.573
- Senna, what are you doing?
- I am sewing

01:28:56.653 --> 01:28:58.809
- this button back on that.
- No, we're done!

01:28:58.889 --> 01:29:00.410
You can't send them out there without a coat.

01:29:00.490 --> 01:29:01.478
Get out there!

01:29:01.558 --> 01:29:04.129
- Do you need me to do something?
- Babe, do whatever.

01:29:04.461 --> 01:29:05.982
Do you want me to do something? I'll go out.

01:29:06.062 --> 01:29:08.819
- Oh, you are so cute.
- Hat! Get it. Gray hat!

01:29:08.899 --> 01:29:11.121
Here, here's a red hat! Do you need this hat?

01:29:11.201 --> 01:29:12.589
- No, the gray hat. The gray hat.
- Is she ready?

01:29:12.669 --> 01:29:14.091
- Ready? Come on. She's coming back.
- Here's another hat.

01:29:14.171 --> 01:29:15.172
Is she ready?

01:29:15.372 --> 01:29:20.219
- Go, go, go. Smile. Smile, smile.
- Okay. Smile.

01:29:20.844 --> 01:29:25.054
Whoo! Good girl. God, I love this.
No, no, not me, Tom!

01:29:25.215 --> 01:29:26.660
- Me.
- Oh, yes.

01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:28.872
- Coat, coat, coat.
- Coat, coat, coat.

01:29:28.952 --> 01:29:30.363
- Coat!
- Fast, fast, fast, go!

01:29:31.655 --> 01:29:33.157
You look beautiful, honey.

01:29:33.623 --> 01:29:34.693
Hold on. Teeth check.

01:29:36.159 --> 01:29:39.916
Yeah, don't be nervous, okay?
Everybody out there loves you.

01:29:39.996 --> 01:29:42.301
I wouldn't have invited them if they didn't.

01:29:43.867 --> 01:29:44.855
They're clapping.

01:29:44.935 --> 01:29:47.177
Shh. They love it. They love you.

01:29:49.239 --> 01:29:50.240
Okay.

01:29:51.041 --> 01:29:54.648
- All right. No, wait, wait. Wait for it.
- Okay.

01:29:55.278 --> 01:29:58.953
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Senna Berges-Price.</i>

01:30:00.050 --> 01:30:01.051
Yay!
