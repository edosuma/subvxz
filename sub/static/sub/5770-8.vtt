WORTH IT TO GO HOME.

00:26.852 --> 00:29.420

WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.

02:32.195 --> 02:33.631
I'M SORRY, DANNY,

02:33.675 --> 02:35.111
THAT I DON'T LOOK LIKE
A RUNWAY MODEL THIS MORNING.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.069

GOES UNDER,

03:23.115 --> 03:24.726
TO OTHER DOCTORS,
BUT TO THOSE CHARLATANS?

03:24.769 --> 03:26.075

03:33.387 --> 03:34.431

03:34.475 --> 03:35.476

INDIVIDUALLY.

THAT IDEA?

03:41.438 --> 03:43.048
HE PRACTICALLY OOZES
LEADERSHIP.

03:43.092 --> 03:45.747
PLUS, IT WAS HIS IDEA TO ME AS
THE FACE OF THOSE TAXI CAB ADS.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.749
WHAT TAXI CAB ADS?

03:47.792 --> 03:50.534

WE DO TAXI CAB ADS NOW?
YEAH.

ISN'T IT?

WITH HANDSOME FACES.

A LEADER HERE.

OF OUR BUILDING? MM-HMM.

04:04.548 --> 04:05.636
I WAS THE ONE
THAT WENT DOWN THERE,

04:05.680 --> 04:07.464
AND I SAID, "LOOK, MAN,
HERE, TAKE $20.

04:07.508 --> 04:10.119

04:36.232 --> 04:37.494

OKAY.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.496
I'VE MADE REPEATED CALLS
AND INQUIRIES

04:39.540 --> 04:41.542
ABOUT GETTING
YOUR FORMER PATIENTS' FILES

04:41.585 --> 04:42.804
TRANSFERRED
TO US UPSTAIRS.

04:42.847 --> 04:44.327
WE'LL GET TO IT
WHEN WE GET TO IT.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.503
IF YOU WANT THOSE FILES,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PRY THEM

04:46.547 --> 04:48.331
OUT OF OUR COLD, DEAD HANDS.EASY, BETS.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.463
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH...

04:49.506 --> 04:53.380
SCRAM.

04:53.423 --> 04:55.469
[scoffs]

04:56.861 --> 05:00.038
HEY, GUYS, I AM NOT GOING
TO TAKE MY DAY OFF TOMORROW.

05:00.082 --> 05:02.040
I FEEL GUILTY--THERE'S TOO MUCH
TO DO AROUND HERE.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.825
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO HAVE
BEST FRIEND DAY?

05:03.868 --> 05:05.522
DANNY, YOU HATE
BEST FRIEND DAY.

05:05.566 --> 05:06.567
THE LAST TIME I TALKED
TO YOU ABOUT IT,

05:06.610 --> 05:08.656
YOU CALLED IT
"BARF FRIEND DAY."

05:08.699 --> 05:10.527
I LOVE BEST FRIEND DAY.
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO DO IT.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.442
WAIT.

05:12.486 --> 05:14.488
WHY ARE YOU MOVING
ALL THIS MEDICAL JUNK IN HERE?

05:14.531 --> 05:16.794
TURNING SHULMAN'S OFFICE
INTO STORAGE.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.274
NO, WE'RE NOT.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.406
WE'RE TURNING IT

05:19.449 --> 05:21.059
INTO MY PRENATAL PATIENT
RESOURCE CENTER.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.496
WE VOTED.
IT'S STORAGE.

05:22.539 --> 05:23.671
YEAH, IT'S TWO TO ONE.

05:23.714 --> 05:24.933
I WASN'T PART OF ANY VOTE.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.891
GUYS,
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.589
AND IT'S ALREADY GETTING
A LOT OF BUZZ IN THE MEDIA.

05:28.632 --> 05:29.894
IT IS?

05:29.938 --> 05:31.374
YEAH. I RAN INTO KELLY RIPA
AT SEPHORA,

05:31.418 --> 05:32.984
AND I TOLD HER ABOUT IT,
AND SHE SAID, "GOOD FOR YOU!"

05:33.028 --> 05:34.246
SORRY, BUT WE VOTED.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.900
IT'S TWO TO ONE.TWO TO ONE.

05:35.944 --> 05:37.902
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU
TO TAKE THE DAY OFF TOMORROW,

05:37.946 --> 05:39.251
AND WE'LL BE FINE
WITHOUT YOU.

05:39.295 --> 05:40.514
YOU KNOW, TOO MANY COOKS--
YOU GET IT.

05:40.557 --> 05:42.254
YEAH.
JUST TOO MANY COOKS.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.561
IT'S--

05:44.605 --> 05:46.433
SO YOU DON'T NEED ME HERE
AT ALL?

05:46.476 --> 05:48.609
OKAY, SURE.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.872
THEN I WILL TAKE TOMORROW OFF
AND SPEND IT WITH MY FRIENDS.

05:50.915 --> 05:52.743
COOL.

05:54.745 --> 05:56.747
WITH THAT, I WILL LEAVE,

05:56.791 --> 05:59.576
BECAUSE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
NO REASON FOR ME TO STAY.

05:59.620 --> 06:00.795
WAIT.

06:03.972 --> 06:05.669
I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.498
JUST...
IT'S KIND OF IN THE WAY.

06:08.542 --> 06:11.196
ET TU,MORGAN?

06:11.240 --> 06:14.112
NO, THAT'S THE ONLY ONE,
I THINK.

06:14.156 --> 06:16.680
HAVE FUN.

06:20.336 --> 06:21.424
[sighs]

06:21.468 --> 06:24.427
IS YOUR NECK HURTING?

06:24.471 --> 06:26.603
YEAH.
I MAYBE GOT A LITTLE CRICK.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.170
MM.

06:28.213 --> 06:29.432
LET'S SEE.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.347
MAY I?
SURE.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.089
WHY DON'T WE CLOSE YOUR EYES,
TAKE A DEEP BREATH?

06:34.132 --> 06:36.831
COUNT TO THREE IN YOUR HEAD
BUT NOT OUT LOUD.

06:36.874 --> 06:38.180
WHOOP!

06:38.223 --> 06:39.355
OOP.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.791
THAT'S BETTER.

06:40.835 --> 06:42.140
I THINK THE PROBLEM
WAS YOUR CHAIR.

06:42.184 --> 06:44.012
IT TOOK BILLIONS OF YEARS
OF EVOLUTION

06:44.055 --> 06:45.317
TO PERFECT THE HUMAN NECK.

06:45.361 --> 06:47.319
CHAIRS HAVE ONLY BEEN AROUND
FOR A MERE EYE-BLINK

06:47.363 --> 06:49.191
OF THAT TIME FRAME.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.715
BRENDAN DESLAURIER.

06:51.759 --> 06:54.457
FROM DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S
HOLISTIC BIRTH CENTER.

06:54.501 --> 06:55.893
OH, NO.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.460
OH, YES. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
WE WORK RIGHT UP THERE,

06:57.504 --> 06:59.331
AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE MET, RIGHT?

06:59.375 --> 07:00.681
[sighs]

07:00.724 --> 07:02.639
THIS IS MY BROTHER,
BUSINESS PARTNER, BEST FRIEND,

07:02.683 --> 07:04.119
AND TENNIS COACH,
DUNCAN.

07:04.162 --> 07:05.642
HI.
HI.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.905
WHAT KIND OF PLANT
YOU GOT THERE, BUDDY? CHECKING.

07:07.949 --> 07:10.430
DOES THIS PLANT HAVE A UTILITY,
OR IS IT STRICTLY DECORATIVE?

07:10.473 --> 07:12.780
ONE TIME I PUT SUNGLASSES
AND A HAT ON IT.

07:12.823 --> 07:14.477
THAT'S HILARIOUS.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.436
I THINK
YOU TWO SHOULD LEAVE.

07:16.479 --> 07:19.917
BUT THANKS AGAIN FOR FIXING
MY NECK, DR. DESLAURIER.

07:19.961 --> 07:22.746
[Danny]
THEY'RE NOT DOCTORS,
THEY'RE MIDWIVES.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.008
OH, HELLO, DANNY.

07:24.052 --> 07:26.750
I'D PREFER
IF YOU CALL ME DR. CASTELLANO.

07:26.794 --> 07:29.057
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND "DOCTOR"
TO BE SUCH A FORMALITY.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.493
IT'S SO DISTANCING.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.190
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT. IT IS DISTANCING.

07:32.234 --> 07:36.368
IT'S THE DISTANCE
BETWEEN ACTUAL DOCTORS LIKE ME

07:36.412 --> 07:38.370
AND QUACKS
LIKE YOU AND YOUR BROTHER.

07:38.414 --> 07:40.460
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, DR. REED?

07:40.503 --> 07:41.461
DR. REED?

07:41.504 --> 07:42.940
HE LEFT.

07:42.984 --> 07:45.116
I THINK HE WAS EMBARRASSED
ABOUT BEING A DRUG DEALER.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.336
NOT THIS AGAIN.
THEY'RE PRESCRIPTIONS.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.294
AND PRESCRIPTIONS
ARE LITTLE PIECES OF PAPER

07:49.338 --> 07:51.514
THAT ONE TRADES IN
FOR NARCOTICS,

07:51.558 --> 07:53.516
MAKING THIS LOVELY ESTABLISHMENT
NOT DIFFERENT

07:53.560 --> 07:54.822
FROM THE HACIENDA
OF PABLO ESCOBAR.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.302
HEY, PAL, I WENT
TO COLUMBIA MEDICAL SCHOOL.

07:57.346 --> 07:59.435
I GOT INTO COLUMBIA.
DIDN'T GO.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.481
WALKED THE CAMPUS,
GOT A BAD VIBE.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.526
DID YOU KNOW THAT MIDWIFERY
PREDATES OBSTETRICS

08:03.570 --> 08:05.615
BY MULTIPLE MILLENNIA?MM-HMM.

08:05.659 --> 08:08.139
SO I ASK YOU THIS, DANNY--
CONFUCIUS, THE BUDDHA,

08:08.183 --> 08:10.533
JESUS CHRIST,
EVEN STING HIMSELF--

08:10.577 --> 08:12.796
WERE THEY BIRTHED BY OB-GYNS?

08:14.842 --> 08:16.321
SHOULD'VE BEEN.
MM.

08:16.365 --> 08:19.499
SHOULDA, WOULDA, COULDA.
IS THAT DOCTOR TERMINOLOGY?

08:19.542 --> 08:22.284
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
THAT STUFF, SO...

08:22.327 --> 08:23.720
BY THE WAY,
I HEAR THERE'S A HOLDUP

08:23.764 --> 08:27.376
ON TRANSFERRING SOME FILES
UPSTAIRS TO OUR NEW CLIENTS.

08:27.419 --> 08:29.117
BUT YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT,
RIGHT, DANNY?

08:29.160 --> 08:31.902
IT'S A GREAT PLACE YOU GOT HERE.
NICE LAYOUT.

08:31.946 --> 08:34.296
GOOD TO KNOW
IN CASE WE DECIDE TO EXPAND.

08:34.339 --> 08:37.038
DUNCAN, SHALL WE?

08:37.081 --> 08:38.561
TOODLES.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.302
DR. C!

08:40.345 --> 08:42.347

08:42.391 --> 08:43.566
THEY'RE MIDWIVES,
SO LET'S NOT--

08:43.610 --> 08:44.959
THEY'RE NOT COOL.

08:45.002 --> 08:46.526
THEY'RE MIDWIVES
WITH ATTITUDE.

08:46.569 --> 08:48.136
ALL RIGHT,
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

08:48.179 --> 08:49.267
YOU KEEP UP YOUR GOOD WORK.

08:49.311 --> 08:50.921
HA!

08:50.965 --> 08:52.793
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

08:55.491 --> 08:56.971
GUYS, LISTEN, THEY JUST DECIDED
THAT THEY'RE GONNA MAKE

08:57.014 --> 08:58.363
ALL THE DECISIONS
FOR THE PRACTICE.

08:58.407 --> 09:00.191
AND THEY TOOK A VOTE,
MAJORITY RULE.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.976
HELLO? I THOUGHT WE LIVED
IN A DEMOCRACY.

09:02.019 --> 09:03.847
WELL, WE'RE JUST HAPPY
THAT YOU COULD MAKE OUR DAY OUT.

09:03.891 --> 09:04.848
OKAY,
MAY I SAY SOMETHING?

09:04.892 --> 09:06.241
IT'S JUST MY OPINION.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.591
YOUR CO-WORKERS SOUND SEXIST,
MISOGYNIST--

09:08.635 --> 09:10.767
AND, YEAH, I'LL SAY IT--
BORDERLINE RACIST.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.595
YOU THINK EVERYONE'S
BORDERLINE RACIST.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.249
GWEN, WE SHOULD LISTEN TO HER,
ALL RIGHT?

09:14.292 --> 09:16.033
SHE IS THE WORLDLY ONE.MM-HMM.

09:16.077 --> 09:19.167
I'M LIKE THE KIND OF FUN,
COOL, SINGLE ONE.

09:19.210 --> 09:20.472
AND YOU'RE THE, UM--
THE COOL MOM.

09:20.516 --> 09:23.475
EXCUSE ME. I DID DATE
A DRUG DEALER IN COLLEGE.

09:23.519 --> 09:24.955
YOU HAVE BEEN MILKING THAT
FOR YEARS.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.175
MINDY, YOU NEED TO MOVE
TO EUROPE.

09:27.218 --> 09:28.611
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.
DO YOU LIKE GOOD FOOD?

09:28.655 --> 09:30.308
MM-HMM.DO YOU LIKE ART?

09:30.352 --> 09:31.701

UNCIRCUMCISED PENISES?

09:31.745 --> 09:32.833
HEY.

09:32.876 --> 09:33.834
EXCUSE ME. HELLO.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.618
I MEAN,

09:35.662 --> 09:36.706
HERE'S THE THING
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

09:36.750 --> 09:37.925
I GET THERE,
NO ONE SPEAKS ENGLISH,

09:37.968 --> 09:39.100
MY HAIR DRYER DOESN'T WORK,

09:39.143 --> 09:40.492
SOMEONE TRIES TO PIN
A DRUG THING ON ME.

09:40.536 --> 09:41.624
OH.
IT HAPPENS.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.278
GUYS, I'M GETTING
A LITTLE WORRIED.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.366
I SHOULD GO BACK TO WORK.

09:44.409 --> 09:45.889
ABSOLUTELY NOT.NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.413
YOU NEED ONE DAY WHERE YOU
SUCK THE MARROW OUT OF LIFE

09:48.457 --> 09:50.067
AND, LIKE, LET IT SLOSH AROUND
IN YOUR MOUTH.

09:50.111 --> 09:51.460
EW! GROSS!

09:51.503 --> 09:53.027
YOU NEED THIS.

09:53.070 --> 09:56.030
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHE'S RIGHT. YOU NEED THIS.

09:56.073 --> 09:58.685

10:02.645 --> 10:03.907
OKAY.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.431
THIS COUNTRY IS SUCCUMBING

10:06.475 --> 10:08.738
TO AN EPIDEMIC
OF OVER-MEDICATION.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.132
THAT'S WHAT THE MIDWIVES SAID.

10:11.175 --> 10:13.613
ALSO, THEY PUT SMOOTH ROCKS
IN THEIR BATHROOM SINK.

10:13.656 --> 10:14.744
YOU WANT ROCKS?

10:14.788 --> 10:16.616
I'M GOING TO A QUARRY
AFTER WORK.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.661
I'LL HAVE ROCKS COMING OUT
YOUR FREAKIN' EYES.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.271
NO, NO, NO.

10:20.315 --> 10:22.534
MRS. DESOUZA, COULD WE HAVE
BUT FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR TIME?

10:22.578 --> 10:24.667
LEGALLY, WE HAVE TO GIVE
YOUR FILE BACK.

10:24.711 --> 10:27.583
BUT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA LIKE
WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.715
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

10:28.758 --> 10:30.717
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW STUPID THAT SOUNDS.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.022
WHOA!
OH, ALL RIGHT.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.720
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S IN THESE VACCINES.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.069
EXCUSE ME?
WHOA, DANNY.

10:35.112 --> 10:36.679
UH, OKAY.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.812
YOU'RE NOT STUPID, OBVIOUSLY.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.465
NO, OF COURSE.
I'M--I'M--I'M--

10:40.509 --> 10:41.728

10:46.297 --> 10:47.777
UH, ALLOW ME...

10:47.821 --> 10:49.083

10:52.173 --> 10:55.829
SHULMAN & ASSOCIATES--

I DIDN'T SEE YOUR AD.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.528

NEVER MIND.

10:59.571 --> 11:01.922
THE POINT IS WE BOTH KNOW YOU'RE
NOT GOING ANYWHERE, ALL RIGHT?

11:01.965 --> 11:03.663
SO WHY DON'T WE POP
YOU IN THOSE STIRRUPS

11:03.706 --> 11:05.403

ALL THE DECISIONS

12:57.559 --> 12:59.256

THE PRACTICE IS SCREWED,
DANNY, OKAY?

13:00.997 --> 13:02.825
NO OTHER PRACTICE

13:02.869 --> 13:04.305
MEN ARE TOO THREATENED
BY MY GOOD LOOKS,

13:04.348 --> 13:06.960

13:38.513 --> 13:39.949
MY GRANDPARENTS

14:05.322 --> 14:06.889
THEY SAID
THEY DIDN'T NEED ME.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.196

14:48.191 --> 14:50.063
[Alex]
I'LL TRY NOT TO.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.240
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
I'M DONE.

14:53.283 --> 14:54.632
OKAY, GOOD.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.288
[Danny]
WHY DID MRS. BAKER CANCEL?

14:58.332 --> 14:59.855
DR. LAHIRI!

14:59.899 --> 15:02.205
SHAUNA, GET ME

15:02.249 --> 15:03.511
OKAY.WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:03.554 --> 15:04.642
I AM DOING
WHAT YOU COULD NOT DO.

15:04.686 --> 15:05.948
MINDY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

15:05.992 --> 15:07.167
TO THE HORNET'S NEST.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.429
NOT THE HORNET'S NEST
THAT'S ON THE ROOF

15:08.472 --> 15:10.083
THAT WE SAW THAT TIME--
I MEANT THE MIDWIVES.

15:10.126 --> 15:11.562

15:18.613 --> 15:19.875
â™ª

15:19.919 --> 15:21.442
WELL, WELL, WELL...

15:21.485 --> 15:23.096
DEBBIE, EMILY, LAUREN--
SO MANY FAMILIAR FACES.

15:23.139 --> 15:27.274
[gong ringing loudly]MIDWIVES!
MIDWIVES!

15:27.317 --> 15:29.058
GOD!
MIDWIVES!

15:29.102 --> 15:30.277
EASY, THERE.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.539
THAT GONG WAS A GIFT
FROM ME TO MYSELF

15:31.582 --> 15:33.149
AFTER A PARTICULARLY
ROUGH FLIGHT.

15:33.193 --> 15:34.411
HEY, I HAVE A QUESTION
FOR YOU.

15:34.455 --> 15:35.630
WHO THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

15:35.673 --> 15:37.110
OH, THAT'S A BIG,
COMPLEX QUESTION,

15:37.153 --> 15:38.459
BUT MY NAME
IS BRENDAN DESLAURIER.

15:38.502 --> 15:39.634
IT'S NICE TO MEET Y--I DON'T THINK SO, PAL.

15:39.677 --> 15:40.765
ALL RIGHT?

15:40.809 --> 15:42.245
I'M NOT GONNA FALL
FOR THAT SMOOTH, CALM,

15:42.289 --> 15:45.205
NAMASTE B.S. THAT EVERYONE ELSE
SEEMS TO FALL FOR,

15:45.248 --> 15:46.815
'CAUSE GUESS WHAT--
I KNOW YOUR TYPE.

15:46.858 --> 15:48.121
LET'S SAY I HAVE
A HEART ATTACK.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.384
HOW WOULD YOU HANDLE THAT?

15:50.427 --> 15:54.214
WOULD YOU, UH, RUB EUCALYPTUS
LEAVES ALL OVER MY CHEST?

15:54.257 --> 15:56.172
HUH?
IS THAT WHAT YOU WOULD DO...

15:56.216 --> 15:57.478
WHILE, UH, YOUR BROTHER
OVER HERE,

15:57.521 --> 16:00.002
HE, UH, PLAYS A RAINSTICK
OR SOMETHING?

16:00.046 --> 16:01.830
YEAH. HIS RAINSTICK?YEAH. RAINSTICK.

16:01.873 --> 16:03.310
LET'S LEAVE DUNCAN
OUT OF THIS.

16:03.353 --> 16:04.354
WHEN YOU HAVE MORE TIME,

16:04.398 --> 16:05.877
I'D LOVE TO TELL YOU
ABOUT WHAT WE DO

16:05.921 --> 16:07.357
SO THAT YOU CAN SPEAK
FROM A PLACE OF KNOWLEDGE

16:07.401 --> 16:09.011
RATHER THAN IGNORANCE.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.621
AND I'M SURE YOU'D LOVE
TO EDUCATE ME...

16:10.665 --> 16:13.233
ALL AFTERNOON,
JUST OVER AND OVER.

16:13.276 --> 16:14.712
JUST MAKING ME LEARN
ABOUT MIDWIFERY.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.279
I WOULD LOVE TO EDUCATE YOU.

16:18.455 --> 16:19.891
LISTEN UP, LADIES.
I GET IT.

16:19.935 --> 16:22.546
IT IS VERY HARD NOT TO GET
SEDUCED BY THESE TWO.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.374
THIS OFFICE IS DOPE.

16:24.418 --> 16:25.985
DIANA SEEMS REALLY COOL.

16:26.028 --> 16:28.378
AND, YEAH, I'M GONNA SAY IT.
THESE TWO--

16:28.422 --> 16:31.077
SUPER-GOOD-LOOKING,
SUPER-HOT GUYS.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.209
MUCH BETTER-LOOKING THAN THE
TWO OLD, GRIZZLED, BEAT-UP GUYS

16:33.253 --> 16:34.297
THAT WORK IN OUR OFFICE.

16:34.341 --> 16:35.907
WHAT?
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:35.951 --> 16:39.172
AND, YEAH, IF YOU ARE A HEALTHY
22-YEAR-OLD PREGNANT WOMAN,

16:39.215 --> 16:41.217
THAT BABY IS GONNA SLIDE
RIGHT OUT OF YOU...

16:41.261 --> 16:42.958
WHETHER IT'S BY US...

16:43.002 --> 16:45.091
OR WHETHER IT'S
BY THESE TWO MIDWIVES

16:45.134 --> 16:46.962
OR WITH A JITTERY TRAIN
CONDUCTOR DURING A BLIZZARD.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.747
BUT WHAT
IF THERE'S COMPLICATIONS?

16:49.791 --> 16:50.966
IF YOU'RE MIDDLE-AGED...

16:51.010 --> 16:52.315
YOU HAVE DIABETES,
IF YOU'RE OBESE--

16:52.359 --> 16:54.404
NO OFFENSE,
ALL RIGHT?

16:54.448 --> 16:57.146
THEN NO AMOUNT OF BREATHING
TECHNIQUES AND SCENTED OILS

16:57.190 --> 16:58.278
IS GONNA HELP YOU.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.454
I AM.
AND THESE GUYS ARE.

17:00.497 --> 17:02.412
THEY MIGHT NOT BE EASY
ON THE EYES...

17:02.456 --> 17:03.326
WHAT? NO.
THAT'S NOT COOL.

17:03.370 --> 17:04.545
BUT THEY'RE GOOD DOCTORS.

17:04.588 --> 17:06.068
MEANWHILE, THESE TWO--

17:06.112 --> 17:07.896
THEY'RE GONNA DROP YOU CURBSIDE
AT COLUMBIA PRESBYTERIAN

17:07.939 --> 17:09.463
ON THEIR WAY TO COACHELLA.

17:09.506 --> 17:10.855
WE HAVE NEVER BEEN

17:10.899 --> 17:12.466
TO THE COACHELLA VALLEY
MUSIC AND ARTS FESTIVAL.

17:12.509 --> 17:13.989
TELL ME THIS,
DESLAURIERS.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.425
IS IT TRUE
OR IS IT NOT TRUE

17:15.469 --> 17:18.037
THAT IF YOUR PATIENTS
HAVE COMPLICATIONS,

17:18.080 --> 17:20.256
YOU DROP THEM OFF
WITH OBSTETRICIANS LIKE US?

17:20.300 --> 17:22.389
YES, WE EXPLAIN UP FRONT
TO ALL OF OUR PATIENTS--

17:22.432 --> 17:23.564
I'M SORRY, YOUR WHAT?

17:23.607 --> 17:26.219
[whispering]
WE HAVE TO SAY "CLIENTS."

17:26.262 --> 17:27.394
TO OUR CLIENTS.

17:27.437 --> 17:28.482
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.136
ALL RIGHT, LADIES...

17:30.179 --> 17:31.485
LET'S GO DOWNSTAIRS.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.400
LET'S SET UP APPOINTMENTS
WITH SOME REAL DOCTORS.

17:33.443 --> 17:34.575
AND IN A MONTH OR SO,

17:34.618 --> 17:36.881
WE'RE GONNA DEBUT
THE SHULMAN & ASSOCIATES

17:36.925 --> 17:38.579
PRENATAL RESOURCE CENTER.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.015
KELLY RIPA'S A BIG FAN.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.452
SO WE GOT A-A LOT OF BIG THINGS
ON THE HORIZON.

17:42.496 --> 17:44.280
ARE YOU GOOD?
YEAH.

17:44.324 --> 17:45.673
OKAY.
GREAT JOB.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.242
NO, DIANA!
I'M HOLDING ON TO THIS MALLET.

17:49.285 --> 17:50.895
ALL RIGHT?

17:50.939 --> 17:52.114
AND IF YOU STEAL
ANOTHER PATIENT,

17:52.158 --> 17:54.116
I'M GONNA COME BACK
FOR THIS GONG.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.379
DOCTOR?

18:03.386 --> 18:04.692
MAKE A WISH.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.436
[both exhale sharply]

18:10.828 --> 18:13.614
OKAY, THAT WAS
KIND OF HOT.

18:13.657 --> 18:14.658
REMEMBER...

18:14.702 --> 18:15.964
NO MORE STEALING PATIENTS.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.618
BURN YOU.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.315
PLEASURE MEETING YOU.

18:19.359 --> 18:20.708
LATER, MAN.

18:20.751 --> 18:21.796
BYE, DUNCAN.
I'LL EMAIL YOU.

18:21.839 --> 18:23.276
HEY, DON'T TALK TO HIM.
LET'S GO.

18:28.237 --> 18:29.978
HEY.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.980
LISTEN, WE OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.

18:32.023 --> 18:33.851
YEAH, YOU DO.
LET'S HEAR IT.

18:33.895 --> 18:35.462
I JUST DID IT.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.594
NO, YOU SAID,
"I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY."

18:37.638 --> 18:40.728
SAYING YOU OWE ME $10
IS DIFFERENT THAN GIVING ME $10.

18:40.771 --> 18:43.165
YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE YOU $10?

18:43.209 --> 18:44.471
YEAH, OKAY.

18:45.733 --> 18:46.951
THERE YOU GO.

18:46.995 --> 18:48.170
I APOLOGIZE.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.650
WE APOLOGIZE.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.478
YOU GUYS, YOU CANNOT GANG UP
ON ME ANYMORE.

18:51.521 --> 18:52.957
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT,
I WANT TO BE INVOLVED,

18:53.001 --> 18:54.263
AND I WANT YOU
TO LISTEN TO MY INPUT.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.482
FAIR ENOUGH.

18:55.525 --> 18:57.048
LISTEN, MINDY, DANNY,
YOU WILL BE IN CHARGE,

18:57.092 --> 18:58.920
AND I WILL REMAIN
AS THE FACE OF THE COMPANY.

18:58.963 --> 19:01.052
NO, NO, NO.
YOU ALSO HAVE TO BE INVOLVED.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.053
THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP.

19:02.097 --> 19:04.099
UGH, MISERABLE.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.187
AND YOU CAN'T BE
ON THE PHONE ALL THE TIME.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.145
YES.LIGHT TEXTING?

19:06.188 --> 19:07.320
NO, YOU CAN'T,
RIGHT, DANNY?

19:07.363 --> 19:08.408
RIGHT.

19:08.451 --> 19:09.713
TWO TO ONE.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.019
[scoffs]
FINE.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.500
THERE YOU GO.

19:14.892 --> 19:17.417
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD CALL THE PLACE?

19:17.460 --> 19:19.158
[all suggesting
different names]

19:23.640 --> 19:25.816
HOW ABOUT
SHULMAN & ASSOCIATES?

19:26.904 --> 19:28.515
IT'S GOT A NICE RING
TO IT.

19:28.558 --> 19:31.039
HEY-OH![camera shutter clicks]

19:31.082 --> 19:32.780
WOW, THAT IS A NICE MOMENT.

19:32.823 --> 19:36.523
I'M GONNA CALL IT
THE FOUNDING OF A NEW DYNASTY.

19:36.566 --> 19:40.135
I'M GONNA SELL YOU GUYS THE
PRINTS ONCE I GET 'EM DEVELOPED.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.441
[sighs] THERE'LL BE
A LITTLE MARKUP FOR MY TROUBLE.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.225
[pager beeping]

19:43.269 --> 19:45.271
[sighs]
DAMN IT.

19:45.314 --> 19:47.708
OKAY, UM, I GOT TO GO.
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS TOMORROW.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.493

19:50.537 --> 19:52.321
OH, I THINK I JUST TWEETED SOMETHING.

19:52.365 --> 19:53.975
[Mindy]
PLEASE DON'T TAKE
ANY MORE PHOTOS OF ME.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.455
WE'RE BETTER-LOOKING
THAN THOSE MIDWIVES, RIGHT?

19:55.498 --> 19:57.761
THANK YOU.
WE'RE SO MUCH BETTER-LOOKING.

19:57.805 --> 19:59.372
â™ª TAKE ONE,
SWALLOW IT DOWN â™ª

19:59.415 --> 20:02.592
â™ª LET IT MELT DOWN
INTO YOUR BLOOD, AND YOU â™ª

â™ª FLY AWAY
INTO THE NEST â™ª

20:07.684 --> 20:10.513
THE PEOPLE ARE REPRESENTED
BY TWO SEPARATE YET EQUALLY...

20:10.557 --> 20:12.428
GOD, THIS PLACE
IS DEPRESSING.

20:12.472 --> 20:13.908
JOSH!

20:13.951 --> 20:15.518
WHY DO HOSPITALS ALWAYS HAVE
THE WORLD'S UGLIEST POSTERS?

20:15.562 --> 20:18.042
INDIANAPOLIS
HAS A JAZZ FEST? GROSS.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.566
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:19.609 --> 20:21.263
WELL, I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN A FEW DAYS.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.483
I THOUGHT I'D BETTER
COME TO YOU.

20:23.526 --> 20:26.007
BROUGHT YOU SOME THAI FOOD,
BUT I THREW OUT THE RICE.

20:26.050 --> 20:28.052
IT HAD LITTLE PEAS IN IT.
IT WAS BUMMING ME OUT.

20:28.096 --> 20:31.578
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
THIS IS SO SWEET.

20:31.621 --> 20:33.014
GOD, I WISH I GOT
TO SEE YOU MORE.

20:33.057 --> 20:35.582
WELL, I THINK YOU CAN HAVE
