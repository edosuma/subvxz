07:51.558 --> 07:53.516
MAKING THIS LOVELY ESTABLISHMENT
NOT DIFFERENT

07:53.560 --> 07:54.822
FROM THE HACIENDA
OF PABLO ESCOBAR.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.302
HEY, PAL, I WENT
TO COLUMBIA MEDICAL SCHOOL.

07:57.346 --> 07:59.435
I GOT INTO COLUMBIA.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.481
WALKED THE CAMPUS,
GOT A BAD VIBE.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.526
DID YOU KNOW THAT MIDWIFERY
PREDATES OBSTETRICS

08:03.570 --> 08:05.615
BY MULTIPLE MILLENNIA?MM-HMM.

08:05.659 --> 08:08.139
SO I ASK YOU THIS, DANNY--
CONFUCIUS, THE BUDDHA,

JESUS CHRIST,
EVEN STING HIMSELF--

08:10.577 --> 08:12.796
WERE THEY BIRTHED BY OB-GYNS?

08:14.842 --> 08:16.321

MM.

08:16.365 --> 08:19.499
SHOULDA, WOULDA, COULDA.

08:19.542 --> 08:22.284
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
THAT STUFF, SO...

08:22.327 --> 08:23.720
BY THE WAY,
I HEAR THERE'S A HOLDUP

08:23.764 --> 08:27.376
ON TRANSFERRING SOME FILES
UPSTAIRS TO OUR NEW CLIENTS.

08:27.419 --> 08:29.117
BUT YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT,
RIGHT, DANNY?

08:29.160 --> 08:31.902
IT'S A GREAT PLACE YOU GOT HERE.
NICE LAYOUT.

08:31.946 --> 08:34.296
GOOD TO KNOW
IN CASE WE DECIDE TO EXPAND.

08:34.339 --> 08:37.038

08:57.014 --> 08:58.363
ALL THE DECISIONS
FOR THE PRACTICE.

08:58.407 --> 09:00.191
AND THEY TOOK A VOTE,
MAJORITY RULE.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.976
HELLO? I THOUGHT WE LIVED
IN A DEMOCRACY.

09:02.019 --> 09:03.847
WELL, WE'RE JUST HAPPY
THAT YOU COULD MAKE OUR DAY OUT.

09:03.891 --> 09:04.848
OKAY,
MAY I SAY SOMETHING?

09:04.892 --> 09:06.241
IT'S JUST MY OPINION.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.591
YOUR CO-WORKERS SOUND SEXIST,
MISOGYNIST--

09:08.635 --> 09:10.767
AND, YEAH, I'LL SAY IT--
BORDERLINE RACIST.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.595
YOU THINK EVERYONE'S
BORDERLINE RACIST.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.249
GWEN, WE SHOULD LISTEN TO HER,

YOU HAVE BEEN MILKING THAT
FOR YEARS.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.175
MINDY, YOU NEED TO MOVE

HERE'S THE THING
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

09:36.750 --> 09:37.925
I GET THERE,
NO ONE SPEAKS ENGLISH,

09:37.968 --> 09:39.100
MY HAIR DRYER DOESN'T WORK,

09:39.143 --> 09:40.492
SOMEONE TRIES TO PIN
A DRUG THING ON ME.

09:40.536 --> 09:41.624
OH.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.278
GUYS, I'M GETTING
A LITTLE WORRIED.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.366
I SHOULD GO BACK TO WORK.

09:44.409 --> 09:45.889
ABSOLUTELY NOT.NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.413
YOU NEED ONE DAY WHERE YOU
SUCK THE MARROW OUT OF LIFE

09:48.457 --> 09:50.067
AND, LIKE, LET IT SLOSH AROUND
IN YOUR MOUTH.

09:50.111 --> 09:51.460
EW! GROSS!

09:51.503 --> 09:53.027
YOU NEED THIS.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.738
TO AN EPIDEMIC
OF OVER-MEDICATION.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.132
THAT'S WHAT THE MIDWIVES SAID.

10:11.175 --> 10:13.613
ALSO, THEY PUT SMOOTH ROCKS
IN THEIR BATHROOM SINK.

10:13.656 --> 10:14.744
YOU WANT ROCKS?

10:14.788 --> 10:16.616
I'M GOING TO A QUARRY
AFTER WORK.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.661
I'LL HAVE ROCKS COMING OUT

BUT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA LIKE
WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.715
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

10:28.758 --> 10:30.717
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW STUPID THAT SOUNDS.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.022
