00:00.930 --> 00:02.800
<i>[narrator] Previously on
Worst Cooks in America...</i>

00:02.800 --> 00:04.060
<i>[Cliff] Who has what
it takes to be the next</i>

00:04.070 --> 00:05.700
<i>culinary warrior?</i>

00:05.700 --> 00:07.000
[screaming] Let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

00:07.000 --> 00:09.400
It turned into a melee.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.840
- [groans in pain]
- [man 1] Oh!

00:10.840 --> 00:12.840
<i>[Anna] Cliff and I are
gonna teach you guys</i>

00:12.840 --> 00:15.780
<i>a dish that is
bursting with flavor.</i>

00:15.780 --> 00:17.110
Oh, my God, why is it smoking?

00:17.110 --> 00:18.710
Listen! No, wait. Listen.

00:18.710 --> 00:19.950
I can't think!

00:20.720 --> 00:21.580
This is unexpected.

00:21.580 --> 00:22.820
Denise, I'm so sorry

00:22.820 --> 00:24.080
but I'm gonna have
to ask for your apron.

00:24.090 --> 00:24.750
[whispers] Thank you so much.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.150
<i>I think I improved.</i>

00:26.160 --> 00:28.660
I'm gonna have a picture
of Chef Cliff in my kitchen.

00:28.660 --> 00:29.820
Yes, I will.

00:30.790 --> 00:32.760
<i>[narrator] You're about to
enter another dimension.</i>

00:32.760 --> 00:34.860
<i>A dimension of time and space.</i>

00:34.860 --> 00:38.970
<i>A dimension of overcooked
meat and bad knife cuts.</i>

00:38.970 --> 00:42.170
<i>You've crossed over
into the bad food zone.</i>

00:42.170 --> 00:42.970
<i>Picture if you will...</i>

00:42.970 --> 00:44.070
Oh, that's a fire!

00:44.070 --> 00:45.940
All of it,
it just disintegrated.

00:45.940 --> 00:47.070
<i>[narrator] Two master chefs...</i>

00:47.080 --> 00:50.380
This is not what I thought...

00:50.380 --> 00:50.910
<i>[narrator] Anne Burrell...</i>

00:50.910 --> 00:52.980
Yeah!

00:52.980 --> 00:54.480
[narrator] And newcomer,
<i>Chef Cliff Crooks</i>

00:54.480 --> 00:55.950
<i>as himself...</i>

00:55.950 --> 00:57.520
<i>[Cliff] Feel like I'm living
my worst nightmare right now.</i>

00:57.520 --> 00:59.750
Oh, damn it! It's still on.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.360
<i>[narrator] ...who must
transform these poor souls</i>

01:01.790 --> 01:02.960
<i>from TV dinners...</i>

01:02.960 --> 01:05.230
- [Anne] Are you stirring with a fork?
- No.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.560
[narrator]
<i>to kitchen winners.</i>

01:06.560 --> 01:07.800
This is delicious.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.600
<i>[narrator] Some
are total strangers.</i>

01:09.600 --> 01:11.400
- Pop, pop, pop, pop.
- These hips don't shake.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.570
<i>[narrator] Others, old friends.</i>

01:12.570 --> 01:14.200
No, no, no.
It's that one up there.

01:14.200 --> 01:18.740
<i>[narrator] But only one person
will escape with $25,000.</i>

01:18.740 --> 01:19.540
[all cheering]

01:19.540 --> 01:21.010
I'm living my dream.

01:21.010 --> 01:23.410
<i>[narrator] A culinary
nightmare so bad...</i>

01:23.410 --> 01:25.980
- Get the water in.
- Water, water.

01:25.980 --> 01:27.950
<i>[narrator] I can't even do
this impression anymore.</i>

01:27.950 --> 01:30.080
Ew! Salmonella everywhere.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.850
I am having a heart attack.

01:31.850 --> 01:32.750
<i>[narrator] Next stop...</i>

01:32.760 --> 01:34.190
I'm a goblin in the kitchen.

01:34.190 --> 01:36.090
[narrator]
Worst Cooks in America,

01:36.090 --> 01:38.230
The Disaster Zone.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.700
Oh, my goodness!

01:42.700 --> 01:45.300
- [all cheering]
- [woman] Take a dip!

01:46.800 --> 01:50.900
Welcome, welcome, recruits
to the very exclusive

01:50.910 --> 01:53.740
Worst Cooks
Beach Club and Marina.

01:53.740 --> 01:55.340
It's bougie here.

01:55.340 --> 01:57.040
You've made it through
the first two weeks here

01:57.050 --> 02:00.550
but we don't want you thinking
life at boot camp is a picnic.

02:00.550 --> 02:01.850
We do not actually think that.

02:01.850 --> 02:03.850
[Cliff] We're throwing
you in the deep end today

02:03.850 --> 02:08.220
to see which team can make us
the tastiest beach picnic basket.

02:08.220 --> 02:09.960
All in a head-to-head
relay race.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.360
Oh!

02:11.360 --> 02:13.190
Here's how this
is going to work.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.900
Two recruits from each team
are gonna start the relay race

02:16.900 --> 02:19.100
at station one.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.770
The team must
successfully recreate

02:21.770 --> 02:25.570
- a classic lobster roll.
- [all exclaiming]

02:25.570 --> 02:28.080
But to get to the lobsters,
you'll need to find

02:28.080 --> 02:30.010
and grab them
from the tank of seaweed.

02:30.010 --> 02:31.150
[man gags]

02:31.150 --> 02:32.450
[Cliff] Once a dish
is completed,

02:32.450 --> 02:34.980
the dish must be placed
in your team's picnic baskets.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.820
And then, the next recruits
can start on their dish.

02:37.820 --> 02:39.750
Next up is station two.

02:39.760 --> 02:43.020
Recruits must recreate a classic

02:43.030 --> 02:43.820
chicken club sandwich.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.590
[all] Ooh!

02:45.590 --> 02:50.760
But you must retrieve your
ingredients from the sand pits.

02:50.770 --> 02:53.700
I wore my good hair today.
This is trouble.

02:53.700 --> 02:54.870
You hair's not going in there.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.100
- Says you.
- [all chuckling]

02:56.110 --> 02:57.770
Then, for the final station,

02:57.770 --> 03:00.810
the recruits must make
a watermelon and feta salad

03:00.810 --> 03:01.780
with a lime vinaigrette.

03:01.780 --> 03:03.110
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:03.110 --> 03:04.750
Butt your ingredients
are in these boats.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.880
[all exclaiming]

03:06.880 --> 03:09.920
You have 35 minutes to get
through all three stations

03:09.920 --> 03:12.120
and assemble
your picnic baskets.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.390
But that's not all.

03:13.390 --> 03:15.820
Before you guys
dive into this race,

03:15.820 --> 03:18.690
you guys will have to make
a whole pitcher of lemonade.

03:18.690 --> 03:19.730
By hand.

03:19.730 --> 03:20.890
- Are you ready?
- [all] Yes.

03:20.900 --> 03:21.460
Great, time starts now.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.130
[all shouting]

03:23.130 --> 03:25.200
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- [Al] Let's go, let's go, let's go.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.070
Quick, quick, quick!

03:26.070 --> 03:27.400
Oh we got it!

03:27.400 --> 03:28.900
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

03:28.940 --> 03:30.100
That's it, go!

03:30.110 --> 03:31.810
- [screaming]
- Get them, get them, get them.

03:31.810 --> 03:34.270
[indistinct shouting]

03:35.840 --> 03:37.080
[Al] Oh, we gotta cut that one.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.480
We're squeezing lemons, okay?

03:38.480 --> 03:41.150
<i>Melody's over there,
she's cutting the lemons up.</i>

03:41.150 --> 03:43.750
Peachez and I, you know, we're
trying to get the juicers going.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.150
[Cliff] This is real.

03:45.150 --> 03:47.390
This is gonna be one
big comedy of errors.

03:47.390 --> 03:49.220
[Peachez] We are killing
it, y'all. Let's go, blue team!

03:49.230 --> 03:50.060
[screams]

03:50.060 --> 03:52.230
[indistinct shouting]

03:52.590 --> 03:54.130
Squeeze this, baby!

03:54.130 --> 03:56.900
Although, we are a team,
don't work well as a team

03:56.900 --> 03:57.530
<i>at all.</i>

03:57.530 --> 03:58.570
Shoot.

03:58.570 --> 04:00.400
Come on, we're almost there,
we're almost there.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.240
[Peachez screaming]
Ice and sugar, ice and sugar!

04:03.810 --> 04:04.710
You're good, go go go!

04:04.710 --> 04:06.010
We're good, go go go go!

04:06.770 --> 04:08.110
- Water, water!
- One more bottle.

04:08.710 --> 04:10.310
Don't spill it, oh, my God!

04:10.980 --> 04:12.850
Pure chaos right now.

04:12.850 --> 04:14.820
[indistinct shouting]

04:14.820 --> 04:15.620
There you go!

04:15.620 --> 04:18.390
[indistinct shouting]

04:18.390 --> 04:21.790
Get in, where are you,
little lobster?

04:21.790 --> 04:23.390
<i>[Peachez] First up,
it's me and Eddie</i>

04:23.390 --> 04:26.290
<i>and we are playing
a game called Clawed Out.</i>

04:27.900 --> 04:29.730
My little pincher, come on baby!

04:29.730 --> 04:30.830
Go, get that lobster!

04:30.830 --> 04:32.770
Al and I are up first
for the red team.

04:32.770 --> 04:34.700
[Al] Can you use two hands?

04:34.700 --> 04:37.740
We have to dig through this
big aquarium of seaweed

04:37.740 --> 04:39.170
<i>to get to our lobsters claws.</i>

04:39.170 --> 04:40.740
Come on, dig girl!

04:40.740 --> 04:42.140
Dig, girl. Dig!

04:42.140 --> 04:44.750
Who knew seaweed was so dense?

04:44.750 --> 04:46.050
[Al] I got a claw.
I got a claw.

04:46.050 --> 04:47.210
Good, good, good.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.380
- Go, go, go!
- Yes, yes, yes!

04:49.390 --> 04:50.150
Are we good?

04:50.150 --> 04:51.790
No, we need more.

04:51.790 --> 04:52.950
You got it? You got it!

04:53.020 --> 04:54.890
[screams] Yeah!

04:54.890 --> 04:55.820
[Peachez] We need more,
we need more.

04:55.820 --> 04:59.730
[all shouting]
Right there! It's right there!

04:59.730 --> 05:00.690
So, I'm digging
through this thing.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.100
Seaweed, more seaweed.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.600
They put baby in the corner,
honey. Take her out, take her out.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.600
I finally get enough lobster.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.840
- [woman] Great!
- [Peachez] Let's go, let's go!

05:09.840 --> 05:11.540
- Okay, okay.
- [Peachez] Crack those babies open.

05:11.540 --> 05:13.540
It's time to get cracking.

05:13.540 --> 05:16.080
Try not to murder the meat.
Get the milk and the butter.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.840
It seems like there's
a little bit of tension

05:17.850 --> 05:19.880
between Kara and Al.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.350
- Grab me a little coriander--
- It's right there.

05:21.350 --> 05:22.980
Give me the damn lemon.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.420
<i>[Kara] As I'm trying to
follow the ingredients...</i>

05:25.420 --> 05:26.620
Half cup of mayo.

05:26.620 --> 05:30.420
I don't know that Al
is doing exactly the same.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.960
I don't know if I'm doing
this right, but...

05:31.960 --> 05:34.830
Stop talking and work, let's go!

05:34.830 --> 05:36.660
[Melody] Let's go,
let's stay ahead.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.830
You're gonna think
we're down in Maryland

05:38.830 --> 05:41.900
'cause we are making
lobster rolls, baby.

05:41.900 --> 05:44.600
Oh wait, that's crab.
I'm in a different place.

05:44.610 --> 05:46.410
I'm bringing these over to you.

05:46.410 --> 05:48.140
<i>[Eddie] Peachez and I
work so well together</i>

05:48.140 --> 05:49.710
because we love each other.

05:49.710 --> 05:50.910
Yeah, lemon juice
is going in there.

05:50.910 --> 05:52.910
The celery salt also
needs to go in there

05:52.920 --> 05:54.380
and then you also
need the mayonnaise.

05:54.380 --> 05:56.320
She is always encouraging me.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.050
Eddie, honestly,
you are killing it.

05:58.050 --> 06:00.290
I need those
words of affirmation,

06:00.290 --> 06:01.560
especially in the kitchen.

06:01.560 --> 06:02.790
Oh, this hair, honey.

06:02.790 --> 06:04.560
It may look good
but it is not functional.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.090
Let's get your mayo, Eddie.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.700
Is this... Hey, is this one
cup? This is one cup, right?

06:08.700 --> 06:10.500
No, did you-- Measure it.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.770
[Al] Kara, we gotta taste this.

06:11.770 --> 06:15.070
The lobster isn't tasting
like the original.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.800
Oh, my God!
There's way too much salt.

06:16.810 --> 06:17.970
Where's that lemon?

06:17.970 --> 06:19.740
-Okay, that's enough.
-How much butter? How much butter?

06:19.740 --> 06:21.910
I have to get this roll toasted

06:21.910 --> 06:23.710
and we cannot toast
a roll without butter.

06:23.710 --> 06:25.010
Three tablespoons.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.850
As soon as that
butter hits that pan...

06:27.850 --> 06:29.080
I don't know,
do you have everything?

06:29.080 --> 06:29.820
Oh, boy!

06:29.820 --> 06:33.190
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

06:33.190 --> 06:35.920
A week ago,
if there was a fire like that,

06:35.920 --> 06:37.020
<i>it would have been over.</i>

06:37.030 --> 06:37.860
Not my good hair.

06:37.860 --> 06:39.730
Not my good hair
around that fire.

06:39.730 --> 06:41.230
- Okay.
- [Melody] Put a top on.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.300
- Atta, baby!
- That's okay.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.900
We know how to work with this.

06:46.900 --> 06:48.500
[Peachez] Just a little bit,
we're gonna be good.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.570
We're going to be good.

06:49.570 --> 06:52.870
This is the longest
lobster roll ever, let's go!

06:52.880 --> 06:55.010
Oh, you have too much
mayonnaise on that thing.

06:55.010 --> 06:57.780
Let's go, come on, red team.
Let's go!

06:57.780 --> 06:59.550
It's hard to hear Chef Anne

06:59.550 --> 07:02.180
when a lot
of people are talking.

07:02.180 --> 07:04.020
- Let's go, let's go.
- All right, let's go.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.150
Got it?

07:06.750 --> 07:07.750
Eddie, taste it.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.890
I like all of it, chef.

07:09.890 --> 07:11.830
No. Get yours to
taste just like that.

07:11.830 --> 07:14.090
Peachez, did you taste it?

07:14.900 --> 07:16.830
It's a lot of lemon
and a lot of mayo.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.270
You gotta decide.

07:18.270 --> 07:19.570
Do you wanna fix it
or do you wanna move on?

07:19.570 --> 07:21.400
- No, let's just go for it.
- We're going for it.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.140
- We gotta go for it, come on.
- Yeah. Let's go. This way.

07:23.140 --> 07:24.740
Come on, you gotta come with me.

07:24.740 --> 07:26.040
[Hilda] Tag out, tag out.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.840
The red team
has this fabulous lead.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.540
[Marti] All right,
good job, good job, good job.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.050
Go, Hector, go, Hector.

07:32.050 --> 07:34.650
<i>[Hilda] Hector and I have to put
together a chicken club sandwich.</i>

07:34.650 --> 07:40.050
But first, we have to dig
for the ingredients.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.820
[Marti] Come girl. Hey, hey!
Oh, that's the lettuce.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.160
[Hector] I saw some bacon.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.960
I got tomato.
I got tomatoes in here.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.930
<i>[Hilda] When I go to
the beach, I don't dig.</i>

07:48.930 --> 07:49.760
[chuckles] No.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.000
Dig, yes, let's go!

07:52.000 --> 07:53.530
<i>[Hilda] But you better
believe right now,</i>

07:53.540 --> 07:55.100
<i>when I'm in competition,</i>

07:55.100 --> 07:57.270
I'll dig all the way
to China, if I have to.

07:59.210 --> 08:01.780
Let's dig for our club, ladies.

08:01.780 --> 08:02.910
[Peachez] Come on, Bianca.

08:02.910 --> 08:03.810
Work! [slurps]

08:03.810 --> 08:05.610
[Cheyenne] The mayo, the mayo!

08:05.610 --> 08:07.850
<i>Why are all these ingredients
in the sand?</i>

08:07.850 --> 08:10.220
This doesn't seem too sanitary.

08:11.220 --> 08:12.620
- Is that everything?
- [Cheyenne] The chicken.

08:12.620 --> 08:14.960
Bianca, you start
cooking the chicken.

08:14.960 --> 08:18.060
Hector, let's see third gear,
maybe! Let's go, come on!

08:18.060 --> 08:19.690
- Let's go, come on!
- Start with bacon.

08:19.700 --> 08:20.990
Start the doggone bacon!

08:21.000 --> 08:22.800
[Hilda] I'm doing all
<i>the cooking.</i>

08:22.800 --> 08:25.000
Hector, you just
put it together.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.730
<i>How easy is that?</i>

08:26.740 --> 08:27.870
No brain cells needed.

08:27.870 --> 08:28.740
Little faster, Hector.
Let's go.

08:28.740 --> 08:31.040
- [clapping]
- Hector, move faster, babe.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.340
-[Hector] Like this? Like this?
-[Cliff] Second gear.

08:33.340 --> 08:34.770
Do the bacon, do the bacon.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.810
<i>[Cheyenne] It's time to start
cooking out chicken club.</i>

08:36.810 --> 08:39.880
She's making the chicken,
I'm making the bacon.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.010
[Bianca] We're making
the cheese.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.820
[Cliff] Oh, you're gonna
find it. You can get it.

08:42.820 --> 08:44.850
We realize, we have no cheese.

08:44.850 --> 08:46.790
<i>She runs back to the sand pit</i>

08:46.790 --> 08:48.590
and I take over
cooking the station.

08:48.590 --> 08:50.820
Hector, taste the original.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.760
<i>[Hector] Sandwiches are
kind of my specialty.</i>

08:52.760 --> 08:54.560
I got this, I got this.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.400
I'm getting cheese,
I'm getting cheese.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.630
I'm gonna get the cheese.
You got this?

08:57.630 --> 09:00.030
[Peachez] Come on, Bianca.
You're gonna find that cheese.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.500
[Eddie] You'll find it, there's
gotta be one over there.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.500
Freaking cheese!

09:03.510 --> 09:06.910
Bianca hates cheese.
The cheese knows this.

09:06.910 --> 09:09.310
Look in the front too, Bianca.
The front area.

09:10.180 --> 09:11.210
Got them, got them.

09:11.550 --> 09:12.510
Got it.

09:12.950 --> 09:16.120
The cheese felt
my love for it and just...

09:16.120 --> 09:17.520
came to me.

09:17.520 --> 09:18.650
Where the h...

09:18.650 --> 09:20.050
<i>[Bianca] Did you
steal all the cheese?</i>

09:20.060 --> 09:23.990
I found my cheese because
I know how to look for things.

09:23.990 --> 09:25.630
[Peachez] Oh, you did it!

09:25.630 --> 09:27.060
Oh, just kidding.
That was the bucket.

09:27.060 --> 09:28.660
[Bianca] Yeah,
that's the bucket.

09:28.660 --> 09:29.560
That's not true.

09:29.570 --> 09:30.630
Okay, I know how
to look for food.

09:30.630 --> 09:33.000
- Okay.
- Okay? Not things but food.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.540
[Peachez] Cheyanne, it looks
like you're doing really well.

09:35.540 --> 09:37.840
Beautiful crispy bacon. Yeah.

09:37.840 --> 09:41.040
I'm flipping chicken,
flipping bacon.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.610
I don't wanna
see sand ever again.

09:43.610 --> 09:45.110
We have 12 minutes.

09:45.110 --> 09:48.820
Cheyenne, start building,
we will wait for the cheese

09:48.820 --> 09:49.920
for a little bit longer.

09:49.920 --> 09:53.150
I don't like cheese
for a reason.

09:55.820 --> 09:57.990
I hate cheese and I guess
cheese hates me too.

09:57.990 --> 09:59.290
Cheese!

10:04.870 --> 10:06.730
I don't wanna
see sand ever again.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.400
We have 12 minutes.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.370
My scavenge hunting skills
are not very good

10:11.370 --> 10:12.940
but I'm here for this.

10:12.940 --> 10:16.410
Cheyenne, start building,
we will wait for the cheese

10:16.410 --> 10:17.810
for a little bit longer.

10:17.810 --> 10:20.050
<i>[Cheyenne] So, I'm here with
these knives and these pans</i>

10:20.050 --> 10:21.950
<i>and all of these ingredients.</i>

10:21.950 --> 10:24.880
Bianca, where is the cheese?

10:24.890 --> 10:26.990
[Cliff] Bianca, abort.
Wash your hands.

10:26.990 --> 10:27.720
Wash your hands.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.060
When you assemble the sandwich,

10:29.060 --> 10:31.990
look at the original and make
sure you assemble it the same way.

10:31.990 --> 10:33.560
[Hilda] Bread. First bread.

10:33.560 --> 10:34.960
Dress it.
Mayonnaise, mayonnaise.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.000
- Gotta put the mayo--
- Mayo, mayo.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.830
[Hilda in accent]
<i>Put some mayonnaise on it.</i>

10:37.830 --> 10:40.070
Not butter, mayonnaise.

10:40.070 --> 10:42.040
[Anne] All right,
you two, let's go.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.800
Beautiful sandwich assembling.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.670
Beautiful, there you go.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.780
[Marti] That is
a beautiful sandwich.

10:48.780 --> 10:51.240
<i>[Hector] Once again,
I find myself worthy...</i>

10:51.750 --> 10:53.380
<i>of calling myself...</i>

10:53.380 --> 10:55.820
[whispers]
Master Sandwich Baker.

10:55.820 --> 10:56.820
Good, we got it.
Go wash your hands.

10:56.820 --> 10:57.780
[indistinct chatter]

10:57.790 --> 10:59.820
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on!

10:59.820 --> 11:02.090
Bianca, just concentrate
on making sure

11:02.090 --> 11:04.620
that the rest of
the sandwich is built

11:04.630 --> 11:05.830
and it matches the original.

11:05.830 --> 11:07.990
Does it look like the original?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.530
[Eddie] This is
the Bianca special.

11:09.530 --> 11:11.900
- This is the Bianca special.
- [Eddie] The cheese-less sandwich.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.700
- It is cheese-less.
- We got nine minutes, guys.

11:13.700 --> 11:15.940
We got nine minutes,
we got this.

11:15.940 --> 11:17.640
[Eddie] Gentle with
the place, good.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.410
The sandwich is looking great.

11:19.410 --> 11:22.110
We don't have the cheese
but it's time to move on.

11:22.110 --> 11:23.080
Does that look
like the original?

11:23.080 --> 11:24.280
Yes?

11:24.980 --> 11:25.910
[Marti] Go, let's go!

11:25.910 --> 11:27.880
[indistinct shouting]

11:27.880 --> 11:29.980
We're going fishing,
we're going fishing.

11:30.620 --> 11:31.650
Catch a big one.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.520
<i>[Peachez] For the last
run of the relay race,</i>

11:33.520 --> 11:39.060
we are making a fresh
watermelon feta summer salad.

11:39.060 --> 11:43.500
But all of our ingredients are
out to sea in these little boats.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.860
Get on there, let's go!

11:44.870 --> 11:48.100
No! Get up. It's sinking,
it's sinking. Come on.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.140
Oh, it's the Titanic, girl.

11:50.140 --> 11:51.600
Okay, let's go, let's go.

11:51.610 --> 11:53.070
Nice, nice, nice!

11:53.080 --> 11:55.180
Come on, they're still
fishing over there. Come on.

11:55.180 --> 11:58.010
You gotta be patient while
you're fishing, Peachez.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.780
Okay, okay, okay!

11:59.780 --> 12:01.580
Okay, okay!

12:01.580 --> 12:04.820
- [screams in excitement]
- Nice, Peachez.

12:04.820 --> 12:06.720
<i>[Melody] I've never
been fishing in my life.</i>

12:06.720 --> 12:07.920
I'm just wheeling and squatting,

12:07.920 --> 12:09.520
wheeling and squatting.

12:09.520 --> 12:13.090
<i>♪ Fishing
Oh, I'm fishing ♪</i>

12:13.100 --> 12:15.800
Look at the original,
taste it, taste it.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.200
- Don't use your fingers.
- Too late.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.870
Oh, that's good.

12:19.870 --> 12:21.740
[Kara] Hey,
y'all have eight minutes.

12:21.740 --> 12:22.840
You have eight minutes.

12:22.840 --> 12:23.870
- [Al] Marti...
- What, baby?

12:23.870 --> 12:25.840
Make those balls look pretty.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.410
Did you guys eat some balls?

12:27.410 --> 12:29.410
- What?
- [Anne] Did you eat some watermelon balls?

12:29.410 --> 12:31.280
[Angie] Eat your ball,
eat your ball, eat your ball.

12:31.710 --> 12:32.950
[Peachez] Work!

12:34.010 --> 12:34.780
Finally get all the boats out.

12:34.780 --> 12:36.650
It's time to get
the ingredients.

12:36.650 --> 12:39.020
Good job guys, good job.
Good job, blue team.

12:39.020 --> 12:40.750
<i>[Melody] Peaches is gonna
do the watermelon.</i>

12:40.760 --> 12:42.690
<i>I'm gonna do the vinaigrette.</i>

12:42.690 --> 12:44.590
Why do I have
to do the vinaigrette?

12:44.590 --> 12:45.860
Who invited you here?

12:45.860 --> 12:47.360
Yeah, you need
to taste the original.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.430
[munching]

12:50.160 --> 12:51.160
Oh, that's bomb!

12:51.230 --> 12:53.570
[chuckling] Now get yours
to taste just like that.

12:53.570 --> 12:54.730
You got us. Yes, Chef.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.800
[Anne] Six minutes, 25 seconds.

12:56.810 --> 13:00.740
Angie, put the zester
on the bowl and then zest.

13:00.740 --> 13:03.110
- Into the bowl.
- Ah, there we go.

13:03.110 --> 13:05.910
Just the green part,
just the green part.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.010
Oh, that's how you zest.

13:07.020 --> 13:07.750
<i>Okay.</i>

13:07.750 --> 13:09.650
[Cliff] Come on, guys!

13:09.650 --> 13:12.720
- Feta cheese crumble.
- Yeah. Crumbling. Hands.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.420
I don't like it but I am
gonna love it right now.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.590
<i>[Marti] I love my daughter.</i>

13:16.590 --> 13:17.890
I want all the success
in the world

13:17.890 --> 13:19.960
but this is mother's
game to win.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.630
[Cliff] Perfect crumble,
Peachez.

13:21.630 --> 13:23.160
That's what she thinks.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.960
<i>'Cause the way that
I'm crumbling this feta,</i>

13:24.970 --> 13:27.300
ain't nobody doing it better.

13:30.140 --> 13:32.040
Let me taste it too,
just to make sure.

13:32.940 --> 13:33.910
Ooh!

13:33.940 --> 13:35.070
Honey!

13:35.080 --> 13:36.840
Okay, let's get
back to building.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.410
[Melody] Okay,
let's just throw it in.

13:38.410 --> 13:39.550
[Angie] "Cheese,
butter, honey--"

13:39.550 --> 13:41.710
It doesn't have olive oil
measurement on here at all.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.950
- It just says-- - [Hilda]
There's no measurement.

13:42.950 --> 13:45.890
[all] Three tablespoons.

13:45.890 --> 13:47.750
Three tablespoons, measure it.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.560
I got you. I got you.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.560
We're just garnishing
on top of the salad.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.860
<i>[Melody] I'm horrible
with my cuts.</i>

13:54.860 --> 13:57.630
<i>I roll it up
and I just slice and slice</i>

13:57.630 --> 14:00.030
and really take my time.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.730
[Cliff] Watching Melody
cut this basil right now

14:01.740 --> 14:03.940
is a combination of all
my fears and nightmares.

14:04.940 --> 14:05.470
[Anne] All right, there we go.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.140
Ladies...

14:07.140 --> 14:08.580
[Angie] "Dress the salad
tossing into..." Okay, that's perfect.

14:08.580 --> 14:09.780
Yeah.

14:09.780 --> 14:11.640
- [Cliff] Are we good?
- [Melody] Yeah, we're good.

14:11.650 --> 14:12.950
- Come on, let's go.
- Strongly strut.

14:12.950 --> 14:14.710
It puts the salad in the basket.

14:14.720 --> 14:19.390
Five, four, three, two, one,

14:19.390 --> 14:21.720
that's it, hands up,
you're done.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.890
<i>[Marti] The salad
is looking so gorgeous.</i>

14:23.890 --> 14:25.890
<i>The dressing tastes incredible.</i>

14:25.890 --> 14:28.860
The red team
is gonna bring this home.

14:28.860 --> 14:29.830
<i>- [Eddie] Voila!
- Yay!</i>

14:29.830 --> 14:30.930
Good job.

14:30.930 --> 14:31.970
- [Marti] Come on! Come on!
- [Al] We did it.

14:31.970 --> 14:33.870
[Kara] Good job, awesome job.

14:33.870 --> 14:35.570
<i>[Marti] It is
the moment of truth.</i>

14:35.570 --> 14:38.000
<i>Are we gonna be
too baked in the sun,</i>

14:38.010 --> 14:40.940
<i>or are we gonna be
golden, tan and delicious?</i>

14:40.940 --> 14:41.540
We'll find out.

14:41.540 --> 14:43.240
Let's go see how they did.

14:48.850 --> 14:52.990
Recruits, we asked you to make
us a beach picnic basket.

14:52.990 --> 14:55.460
Now, let's see which team
had fun in the sun

14:55.460 --> 14:58.090
and which one needs a life raft.

14:58.090 --> 15:00.260
<i>[Marti] The red team
is gonna bring this one home.</i>

15:00.590 --> 15:01.690
Sorry, blue.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.800
All right, first up,
lobster roll.

15:03.800 --> 15:06.770
Al and Kara
and Eddie and Peachez,

15:06.770 --> 15:08.400
both teams were
fans of mayonnaise.

15:08.400 --> 15:12.010
[Cliff] Blue team hasn't
toasted the bun properly.

15:12.010 --> 15:15.810
[Anne] Because of the bun
toast here, the lobster roll round

15:15.810 --> 15:17.040
red team.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.380
Rocking Red Stars!

15:18.380 --> 15:20.580
[woman] Toasted bun!

15:20.580 --> 15:22.820
[Cliff] Okay, let's take a look at
these club sandwiches, shall we?

15:22.820 --> 15:25.050
Hilda and Hector,
Bianca and Cheyenne.

15:25.820 --> 15:27.090
[Anne] Do you guys have cheese?

15:27.860 --> 15:29.020
No, we're cheese shy.

15:29.020 --> 15:33.790
I would say because the red
team's sandwich is complete,

15:33.800 --> 15:35.900
this one will go
to the red team as well.

15:35.900 --> 15:36.900
[all cheering]

15:36.900 --> 15:37.860
[Kara] Let's go, y'all!

15:37.870 --> 15:40.800
And lastly, watermelon salad.

15:40.800 --> 15:44.970
Marti and Angie
and Peachez and Melody.

15:45.670 --> 15:46.970
This dressing is really
nicely balanced

15:46.980 --> 15:48.810
between the acid and the honey.

15:48.810 --> 15:50.840
I feel like the knife
cuts on the basil

15:50.850 --> 15:53.150
might be a little
rough over here.

15:53.150 --> 15:56.880
The winner of
the watermelon feta salad

15:56.890 --> 15:58.050
is the red team.

15:58.050 --> 16:00.390
Watermelon salad,
Red team again.

16:00.390 --> 16:01.820
Really getting tired of this.

16:01.820 --> 16:05.990
The team whose picnic basket
made us the happiest

16:05.990 --> 16:07.430
is the Rocking Red Stars!

16:07.430 --> 16:09.330
[all cheering]

16:10.660 --> 16:13.670
Congratulations.
From my heart.

16:13.670 --> 16:17.400
We're gonna pick one
MVP duo from each team.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.910
These two teams must
go head to head

16:20.910 --> 16:23.180
to win the advantage
in the Skill Drill cook.

16:23.180 --> 16:28.950
The MVP duo from
the Rocking Red Stars is...

16:29.120 --> 16:30.080
Marti and Angie.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.180
[all cheering]

16:31.820 --> 16:33.190
[Kara] Angie!

16:33.190 --> 16:35.120
That vinaigrette was spot on.

16:35.120 --> 16:38.990
And the MVP duo from
the Blue team is...

16:38.990 --> 16:40.830
Bianca and Cheyenne.

16:40.830 --> 16:43.730
[all cheering and clapping]

16:43.730 --> 16:46.700
- How can you be an MVP if you're running...
- I ripped my...

16:46.700 --> 16:48.630
<i>- and you're gonna get a touch down...
- looking...</i>

16:48.640 --> 16:50.540
- and you fumble the ball.
- through the sand.

16:50.540 --> 16:52.470
In this case,
fumbling the cheese.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.740
Although, the sandwich
was incomplete,

16:54.740 --> 16:58.750
- you never gave up looking for the actual cheese.
- [chuckles]

16:58.750 --> 17:02.080
And you didn't give up on
completing the actual dish.

17:02.720 --> 17:06.090
To win the advantage
in this Skill Drill cook,

17:06.090 --> 17:10.690
you ladies must eat as much
watermelon as you can

17:10.690 --> 17:11.820
in one minute.

17:11.830 --> 17:14.260
Let's go, let's go! Come on!

17:14.260 --> 17:16.060
[indistinct shouting]

17:16.630 --> 17:18.660
Oh, but it gets juicier.

17:18.670 --> 17:21.870
You have to eat your watermelon

17:21.870 --> 17:23.140
with your hands tied
behind your back.

17:23.140 --> 17:25.410
[all screaming]

17:27.140 --> 17:28.410
I feel like Gallagher.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.780
Are you ladies ready?

17:30.780 --> 17:32.110
<i>[Angie] I'm ready to do this.</i>

17:32.110 --> 17:33.850
I'm ready to kick
Cheyenne's butt, too.

17:33.850 --> 17:34.880
[all] Yes!

17:34.880 --> 17:36.580
<i>[Hector] Red team, focus.</i>

17:36.580 --> 17:39.090
Bianca is hungry
and likes watermelons.

17:39.090 --> 17:41.720
[Anne] On your mark,
get set, go!

17:41.720 --> 17:44.420

17:47.900 --> 17:50.030
<i>[Peachez] Bianca looks

17:50.030 --> 17:52.770

18:03.110 --> 18:05.340
<i>[Marti] There was a moment where
my entire life flashed before my eyes.</i>

18:05.350 --> 18:09.180
I never wanna see
a watermelon again.

18:09.180 --> 18:11.750
<i>[Peachez] Marti looks like
that little girl from The Exorcist,</i>

18:11.750 --> 18:13.650
Just... [retches]

18:13.660 --> 18:20.030
Five, four, three,
two, one, stop!

18:21.060 --> 18:24.460
Congratulations, Blue team.
You crushed it.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.400
<i>[Peachez] Blue team wins!</i>

18:26.400 --> 18:29.770
Cheyenne and Bianca, you both
have just earned yourselves

18:29.770 --> 18:32.170
the Palate Pal Advantage.

18:32.170 --> 18:33.770
So, this means that
you can ask me to taste

18:33.780 --> 18:37.810
any component of your dish
during the Skill Drill cook.

18:37.810 --> 18:40.580
And I'll be more than happy to
give you feedback and advice

18:40.580 --> 18:42.380
on your flavors.

18:42.380 --> 18:44.850
I am ecstatic because
I need that help, you know?

18:44.850 --> 18:46.590
I need it. [giggles]

18:46.590 --> 18:49.090
[Anne] For today's
Skill Drill cook,

18:49.090 --> 18:51.690
Cliff and I will each
teach you guys

18:51.690 --> 18:53.660
how to make crab cakes,

18:53.660 --> 18:56.100
with a summer salad and a sauce.

18:56.100 --> 18:59.030
Rocking Red Stars,
step into my crab pot.

18:59.030 --> 19:00.830
Blue team, anchors away!

19:00.840 --> 19:02.200
Oh, aye aye, captain!

19:03.070 --> 19:05.400
So recruits, today I'm gonna
show you how to make

19:05.410 --> 19:07.810
a crab cake with dijonnaise

19:07.810 --> 19:10.140
and frisee, fennel
and radish salad.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.410
That's a lot of words.

19:11.410 --> 19:13.150
[giggling]

19:13.150 --> 19:15.720
I am going to teach
you guys to make

19:15.720 --> 19:20.090
crab cakes with a corn
and pepper salad

19:20.090 --> 19:21.820
with a creole mustard sauce.

19:21.820 --> 19:23.060
Oh...

19:23.060 --> 19:25.220
I grew up in Maryland
on a river.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.660
Crab cakes are in my blood.

19:27.660 --> 19:29.530
I am the queen
of the crab cakes.

19:29.530 --> 19:32.870
I am so excited to take
it home to my family

19:32.870 --> 19:36.270
and say, "Hey, you don't have to be the
only one making crab cakes anymore."

19:37.040 --> 19:38.040
Bring them up.

19:38.040 --> 19:38.840
Grill the corn.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.670
Red onion, red pepper.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.710
So, when your pepper
is black everywhere...

19:43.710 --> 19:46.580
<i>[Angie] Chef Anne is asking
us to actually burn a pepper.</i>

19:46.580 --> 19:49.980
Like, aren't we here learn
not to burn our food?

19:49.980 --> 19:52.020
[Anne] And that charred
skin of the pepper,

19:52.020 --> 19:53.420
will fry right off.

19:54.090 --> 19:55.690
[Cliff] The crab cake mix.

19:55.690 --> 19:58.120
Chop tarragon as fine as I can.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.890
Parsley.
Just the leaves, no stems.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.130
And chopped cilantro.
Mayonnaise.

20:03.730 --> 20:04.730
A minced shallot.

20:04.730 --> 20:06.770
Now, I am going to take my crab.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.600
I am going to add breadcrumb.

20:08.600 --> 20:09.840
Now, for the gentle part,

20:09.840 --> 20:11.640
I'm going to fold,
top to bottom.

20:11.640 --> 20:12.970
That's awesome.

20:12.970 --> 20:15.880
[Anne] Mayonnaise,
Worcestershire sauce,

20:15.880 --> 20:17.910
seafood seasoning.

20:17.910 --> 20:19.380
This is creole mustard.

20:19.810 --> 20:20.910
One egg.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.320
Chives. My crackers...

20:23.920 --> 20:27.120
My crab cake mix is ready,
here we go.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.660
[Cliff] Crab is already cooked.

20:29.660 --> 20:31.890
This is gonna go in
the oven, five minutes.

20:31.890 --> 20:35.530
I'm just going to do my
little sauce situation now.

20:35.530 --> 20:39.400
Mayonnaise, cornichon,
creole mustard.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.730
The very last thing that's
going in there is...

20:41.740 --> 20:43.170
half a shallot.

20:43.170 --> 20:45.640
Just mix it up
and guess what? Finish.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.070
Dijonnaise.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.610
Mayonnaise, Dijon mustard
and lemon juice.

20:49.610 --> 20:51.010
We're gonna adjust
this one slightly

20:51.010 --> 20:52.350
with the addition of cornichon.

20:53.980 --> 20:56.150
[Anne] My corn, my pepper.

20:56.950 --> 20:58.050
Watch.

20:58.150 --> 20:58.990
[Marti gasps]

20:58.990 --> 21:00.620
- Oh!
- What?

21:00.620 --> 21:03.060
[Anne] All that
skin comes right off.

21:04.420 --> 21:06.160
All right, now we
have our onions.

21:06.790 --> 21:08.660
Let's just finish it up

21:08.660 --> 21:10.860
with a little
tiny bit of cilantro.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.630
Red wine vinegar and olive oil.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.670
Doesn't it all look pretty?

21:14.670 --> 21:16.000
And it's only a few ingredients

21:16.000 --> 21:17.170
and look how fast I made it.

21:17.170 --> 21:18.970
This is a mandolin.

21:18.970 --> 21:20.740
[woman screaming]

21:20.740 --> 21:23.010
Respect the mandolin.

21:23.010 --> 21:25.650
<i>We are the Worst Cooks
in America, Chef Cliff.</i>

21:25.650 --> 21:28.280
Do you really trust
us with that?

21:28.280 --> 21:30.780
<i>[Eddie] I am so
petrified of the mandolin.</i>

21:30.790 --> 21:33.220
I already almost cut my
thumb off with a knife.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.190
[Cliff] And we're
gonna slice them.

21:35.190 --> 21:36.390
Everyone in the pool together.

21:37.960 --> 21:38.990
Let's plate.

21:38.990 --> 21:40.260
My corn salad.

21:40.590 --> 21:41.960
My crab cake.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.230
And then, we'll give
it a salty smiley face.

21:45.670 --> 21:46.400
And that's all she wrote.

21:47.770 --> 21:49.040
[Cliff] So, our dijonnaise.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.000
I'm going to put the crab
cake right in the middle.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.870
Take a nice little push.

21:52.870 --> 21:54.140
Put it right on top
of my crab cake.

21:54.840 --> 21:55.370
Taste these.

21:56.980 --> 21:57.540
Oh, man!

21:59.010 --> 21:59.910
Makes me think of home.

21:59.910 --> 22:01.210
Aw, nice!

22:01.550 --> 22:02.980
You will have 45 minutes

22:02.980 --> 22:06.090
to replicate my crab
cake dish exactly.

22:06.690 --> 22:09.020
Your time starts right now.

22:09.690 --> 22:11.390
[Peachez] Let's do this,
Blue team.

22:13.590 --> 22:15.900
[Marti] I need a pepper,
need a pepper, need a pepper.

22:15.900 --> 22:17.160
Marti, your shoes
aren't tied, doll.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.430
Thank you, mama!

22:19.570 --> 22:22.770
The tarragon is the one that
looks like the field of dreams.

22:22.770 --> 22:24.040
[Cliff] It looks like
Kevin Costner?

22:24.040 --> 22:26.710
[Peachez] No, it looks like
little baby corn stalks

22:26.710 --> 22:28.740
where angles show up and say,

22:28.740 --> 22:33.380
"It's okay, your mother's not
dead. She's watching from above."

22:34.010 --> 22:36.280
I didn't see that
movie to be honest.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.020
Al, shake your--
Shake your hips.

22:38.020 --> 22:39.890
Shake your... pop, pop, pop.

22:39.890 --> 22:40.750
These hips don't shake.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.020
[Al laughs]

22:42.020 --> 22:43.720
Al, I can get those
hips to shake.

22:43.730 --> 22:46.060
I am so excited to make these

22:46.060 --> 22:47.660
because this is something
that I grew up eating.

But you had it,

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That would've been way too much mayonnaise.

[Marti] Your mayonnaise
roll that you made.

23:07.950 --> 23:10.050
Working next to Al
is a lot of fun.

23:10.150 --> 23:11.380
I didn't make that.

I love big Al.

23:13.050 --> 23:14.950
I'm sorry, Al.

24:54.090 --> 24:55.220
Hilda.

24:55.420 --> 24:58.320
Oh, my gosh, why are you so
onion-cutting challenged?

24:58.730 --> 24:59.630
It's in the brain.

24:59.630 --> 25:01.830
We just cut slices
of the onion, remember?

25:01.830 --> 25:03.660
Oh boy, here we go.

25:03.660 --> 25:05.900
I am not an onion queen.

25:05.900 --> 25:09.170
Ready to cut that onion,
cut that onion.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.870
Slice through it.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.440
Push your knife--
Oh my Gosh! Okay.

25:17.110 --> 25:18.340
Okay, okay. I got you.

25:18.980 --> 25:20.080
Jeez!

25:23.180 --> 25:24.250
Melody, did you taste it?

25:25.690 --> 25:27.390
Uh... No.

25:27.390 --> 25:28.850
Lie to me and tell
me you tasted it.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.760
Mmm...

25:30.760 --> 25:32.690
[sarcastically] Yes, Chef.
I tasted those crab cakes.

25:32.730 --> 25:33.790
But I hadn't.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.100
Well, now really taste it
and check your seasoning.

25:38.900 --> 25:39.700
No salt.

25:39.700 --> 25:40.770
Oh, my God!

25:40.770 --> 25:42.430
No flavor.
It just tastes like fish.

25:45.110 --> 25:46.270
[Melody] Better.

25:48.810 --> 25:51.140
Hector, how's it going?

25:51.150 --> 25:53.210
- [Hector] Going good, it's going good.
- [Anne] Hector...

25:53.810 --> 25:54.380
Hector.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.020
Second gear.

25:57.020 --> 25:58.420
<i>[Hector] I don't know,
I just wanna...</i>

25:58.620 --> 26:00.520
feel the atmosphere.

26:00.520 --> 26:03.820
<i>The environment before
I go into that second gear</i>

26:03.820 --> 26:06.860
<i>because it could be very intimidating
for other people, you know?</i>

26:06.860 --> 26:09.930
[whispers] Second gear,
Hector. Second gear.

26:11.030 --> 26:13.100
I got this.
I think I got this.

26:13.100 --> 26:15.800
<i>♪ Brown food tastes good ♪</i>

26:15.800 --> 26:17.840
[all laughing]

26:17.840 --> 26:22.370
<i>♪ Brown food tastes good ♪</i>

26:22.380 --> 26:23.880
I'm a song.

26:23.880 --> 26:26.750
I really feel like there might
be an album coming soon.

26:26.750 --> 26:27.980
You know, such hits as

26:27.980 --> 26:29.920
"Brown Food Tastes Good",

26:29.920 --> 26:32.950
"Bring to Boil,
Reduce to Simmer",

26:36.090 --> 26:38.990
<i>♪ Thank you for coming

26:38.990 --> 26:40.290
I can't wait.

26:41.130 --> 26:42.760
Eddie, get closer to the board.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.970
Eddie's working on his station
like his station has cooties.

26:45.970 --> 26:47.570
[kid screaming]

26:47.570 --> 26:48.670
<i>His hands are out here</i>

26:48.670 --> 26:50.140
and he's trying
to manipulate things.

26:50.140 --> 26:52.500
Get in it. Get in it. Hips.

26:52.510 --> 26:53.410
- Right?
- Yes.

26:53.410 --> 26:54.670
<i>[Cliff] That's where
you need to be.</i>

26:54.680 --> 26:57.640
So, you are close to the
product you are trying to work on.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.650
Nice, Eddie.
It's exactly what I did.

26:59.650 --> 27:00.910
[Eddie] Thank you. Thank you.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.510
Just give me
some encouragement...

27:02.520 --> 27:03.780
[Peachez] How you doing, Eddie?

27:03.780 --> 27:04.950
I'm doing great now.
I just got coached up.

27:04.950 --> 27:06.420
[Peachez] Good.

27:06.420 --> 27:10.720
"Yeah, you got this! Keep
going. You can do it, Eddie."

27:10.730 --> 27:12.090
Just breathe, brother.
Just breathe.

27:13.890 --> 27:14.890
[Anne] Ten minutes.

27:14.960 --> 27:18.000
You guys should be almost
done with your corn salad

27:18.000 --> 27:21.070
and you should be thinking
about cooking crab cakes.

27:21.070 --> 27:23.140
Hilda, you only
need one crab cake.

27:23.770 --> 27:25.740
Oh, no!

27:25.740 --> 27:27.610
Chef, can you come
taste my crab cakes?

27:27.610 --> 27:30.340
Wait, but it's already--
I'm gonna--

27:31.810 --> 27:33.380
You want me
to taste it now but...

27:33.380 --> 27:35.010
you've already
floured the outside.

27:35.020 --> 27:36.120
- No? Okay.
- No, I don't--

27:36.120 --> 27:36.920
Sorry, Cheyenne.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.350
How you doing?

27:38.350 --> 27:40.390
I haven't gotten
frazzled yet, Hilda.

27:40.390 --> 27:42.390
Good. That a girl! You go.

27:42.390 --> 27:44.890
Next, I have to get started
assembling my salad.

27:44.890 --> 27:47.090
Go ahead and do
these corns first.

27:47.090 --> 27:49.830
So, I grabbed my grilled
corn and I shave it off.

27:49.830 --> 27:51.060
That's the good stuff.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.600
Now, it's time for my onions.

27:52.600 --> 27:53.470
That's these.

27:56.870 --> 27:59.670
I look back and realize
that my corn

27:59.670 --> 28:01.770
is still on the sheet
pan behind me.

28:01.780 --> 28:04.040
Hey Angie, I think
I used your corn.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.580
Here. Sorry, you can use mine.

28:05.580 --> 28:07.150
What?

28:07.150 --> 28:08.710
Kara, I didn't cook
mine like yours.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.680
They looked pretty
much the same.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.820
You took my corn?
Who does that?

28:12.820 --> 28:13.920
What happened, Angie?

28:13.920 --> 28:16.390
Kara took my corn
so I have to use hers.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.560
- I didn't mean to.
- Well, apologize to her.

28:18.560 --> 28:19.930
I'm sorry, Ang.

28:19.930 --> 28:22.060
My corn was perfect, I
spent a lot of time on my corn.

28:22.060 --> 28:22.800
I'm sorry.

28:22.800 --> 28:23.830
[grunts]

28:23.900 --> 28:25.800
<i>She took her corn off
the grill before mine.</i>

28:25.800 --> 28:28.030
<i>So, I'm thinking,
"It's not cooked."</i>

28:28.040 --> 28:29.200
And I got stuck with hers.

28:29.470 --> 28:30.500
[grunts]

28:30.700 --> 28:34.140
I am feeling stressed.
This is horrible, like...

28:34.710 --> 28:36.010
[sighs]
The next part...

28:42.550 --> 28:43.920
[Bianca] Almost, almost.
Thank you.

28:43.920 --> 28:47.390
- Dang it!
- [Cliff] Recruits, five minutes.

28:47.390 --> 28:48.790
Finished the rest of your
salad component, yes?

28:48.790 --> 28:50.690
Yeah. Salad, fennel.

28:50.690 --> 28:52.420
[Cheyenne] Okay, here we
go with the mandolin.

28:53.630 --> 28:54.730
[Melody] I'm so
scared about that.

28:54.730 --> 28:56.400
I can't tell which
way it's going.

28:56.400 --> 28:59.430
It's like a faucet,
righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.

29:00.130 --> 29:00.900
Oh, well there we go.

29:00.900 --> 29:03.200
[Peachez] Ai, yai,
yai, yai, yai.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.740
<i>[Eddie] The mandolin is scary.</i>

29:05.740 --> 29:08.210
They say it's like
the guillotine of the kitchen.

29:09.680 --> 29:12.010
Bianca... angle it back more.

29:12.850 --> 29:14.680
No, no, no. Turn it around.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.750
- Like that?
- The other way.

29:16.750 --> 29:19.020
Me and the mandolin
are not friends.

29:19.020 --> 29:20.720
So, the blade is facing
away from you.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.090
Oh, okay. Like this?

29:22.860 --> 29:24.720
It's backwards,
it's upside down.

29:24.730 --> 29:26.260
It's like three ring circus.

29:26.260 --> 29:28.330
- Like that?
- Now, angle it back.

29:28.800 --> 29:29.800
Yes.

29:29.800 --> 29:32.200
- It's not that hard.
- [Bianca] Oh, I see it.

29:32.900 --> 29:34.000
[Anne] All right,
let's finish up.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
Come on, Al.
Get your sauce done.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.870
I'm begging you,
I'm begging you.

29:38.870 --> 29:41.110
- 30 seconds, recruits.
- 30 seconds.

29:41.110 --> 29:43.010
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

29:45.410 --> 29:47.150
- There you go, Sugar.
- Thank you, baby.

29:48.010 --> 29:50.620
[Peachez] <i>♪ Oh this is
some greasy lettuce ♪</i>

29:50.620 --> 29:54.090
Yeah, that's good.

29:54.090 --> 29:55.820
[Kara] Come on. You're
my only hope, little guy.

29:55.820 --> 29:57.060
You got this.

29:57.290 --> 29:59.220
This is hard. This is hard.

30:03.930 --> 30:09.200
[Cliff and Anne] Five, four,
three, two, one, that's it.

30:09.200 --> 30:11.300
[Anne] Hands up, you're done.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.970
Oh, my God!

30:12.970 --> 30:16.310
My Rocking Red Stars, you
gave me a heart attack today.

30:16.910 --> 30:18.380
[Marti] Same. Ha!

30:18.380 --> 30:19.950
[Al] Me too. [giggles]

30:19.950 --> 30:21.110
[Anne] All right.

30:22.850 --> 30:23.920
Melody, you're up first.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.420
[Cheyenne] Melody!

30:25.420 --> 30:26.350
[Cliff] Come on, Melody.

30:26.350 --> 30:27.550
I feel like I'm on a runway.

30:27.560 --> 30:28.490
Land it right in here.

30:30.020 --> 30:34.060
I am missing the vinaigrette
on my salad.

30:34.660 --> 30:36.660
Well, the sauce is delicious.

30:36.660 --> 30:39.730
The crab cake is delicious.
It's beautifully seared.

30:39.730 --> 30:42.030
I would give you a solid seven.

30:44.670 --> 30:46.310
I take a seven. Thank you.

30:46.810 --> 30:48.410
[Cliff] Cheyenne. [giggles]

30:51.480 --> 30:53.750
The salad itself,
it's a little overdressed

30:53.750 --> 30:56.380
and that's why you have
the pooling on the side here.

30:57.620 --> 30:58.950
Your crab cake's delicious.

30:59.050 --> 31:01.050
- It's a great job.
- Thank you.

31:02.020 --> 31:03.960
- Peachez, come to me.
- Yes?

31:03.960 --> 31:06.090
Oh, it's beautiful, this runway.

31:06.090 --> 31:08.060
Visually, all
the components are here.

31:09.560 --> 31:10.660
Your crab cake is delicious.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.030
The sauce is delicious.
This is an excellent plate.

31:13.070 --> 31:15.300
Ha! Ho! Hoo!

31:15.300 --> 31:17.000
Who is he talking to?

31:17.000 --> 31:18.370
It could-- [stammers]

31:19.070 --> 31:20.670
[giggles]

31:20.670 --> 31:23.580
- Eddie.
<i>- Voila.</i>

31:23.580 --> 31:24.710
[Cliff] Your cuts
are great here.

31:24.710 --> 31:27.210
Thank you. I wanted
to have good cuts.

31:28.480 --> 31:29.950
And your crab cake's
freaking delicious.

31:29.950 --> 31:32.050
What's going on right now?
Is he talking to me?

31:32.050 --> 31:33.050
Thank you, Chef.

31:33.050 --> 31:34.220
[Angie] Great job, Eddie.

31:34.220 --> 31:36.320
This is a good day.

31:36.760 --> 31:38.190
Bianca...

31:41.030 --> 31:43.400
- How do you feel?
- I was confident as [bleep] today.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.400
[all laughing]

31:45.400 --> 31:46.700
[Bianca] I just
came in and I said,

31:46.700 --> 31:48.700
"You know what?
I'm just gonna do it."

31:48.700 --> 31:50.900
The crab cake's delicious,
the sauce is delicious.

31:50.910 --> 31:53.870
All the components that
make the salad are here.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.010
Where's the vinaigrette?

31:55.040 --> 31:56.280
I forgot.

31:56.280 --> 31:57.180
Everything is beautiful.

31:57.180 --> 31:57.880
Just want to tie it together.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.310
Thank you, Chef.

32:00.950 --> 32:05.280
All right, Rocking Red Stars.
Al, you're up first.

32:09.860 --> 32:11.420
Your crab cake is browned.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.390
It feels a tiny bit
on the dry side.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.730
I feel like your crab cakes,
we have like chunks of crab

32:17.730 --> 32:19.770
and then chunks
of the other stuff

32:19.770 --> 32:22.730
rather than having it be
mixed all the way through.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.940
- Correct.
- But your food tastes good.

32:24.940 --> 32:27.270
- Good.
- Marti Party, come on.

32:27.410 --> 32:29.740
Let's go!

32:29.740 --> 32:31.880
As I told you, I grew up in
Maryland, so Chesapeake Bay...

32:31.880 --> 32:34.710
Crabs are in my blood stream.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.720
I was gonna say, like,
"Crabs are where?"

32:36.720 --> 32:38.720
Yeah well, not that kinda crab.

32:38.720 --> 32:42.490
I mean, all the stuff that you
have on your plate tastes nice.

32:42.490 --> 32:45.990
I will say, as fabulous
as you and Peachez are,

32:45.990 --> 32:49.030
you show us your fabulous
by what's on your plate.

32:49.030 --> 32:50.400
- Nice job.
- Whoa! Thank you so much.

32:50.860 --> 32:52.530
Hector!

32:52.530 --> 32:53.730
Let's see, let's see.

32:53.730 --> 32:55.400
[Anne] How do you
feel about this plate?

32:55.400 --> 32:57.370
I can't believe I made it.
I was surprised.

32:57.840 --> 33:00.870
This is absolutely...

33:00.870 --> 33:04.280
the best plate of food
that you have given me, yet.

33:04.280 --> 33:07.150
[all cheering and clapping]

33:07.850 --> 33:08.950
Yes!

33:08.980 --> 33:10.220
[Anne] Hilda!

33:12.050 --> 33:14.090
Your crab cake looks very nice.

33:14.090 --> 33:15.490
Got a nice brown on it.

33:15.490 --> 33:16.590
I learned from the best.

33:18.120 --> 33:20.730
I am so proud of myself.
I can pat myself on the back.

33:20.730 --> 33:22.830
I'm finally doing
something right.

33:22.830 --> 33:24.800
[Anne] This could have
a little more dressing

33:24.800 --> 33:26.370
and I think it might be
just a hair heavy

33:26.370 --> 33:27.870
on the crushed dry pepper.

33:27.870 --> 33:30.040
- Okay.
- 'Cause my mouth is a little on fire.

33:30.040 --> 33:32.400
Okay. Nice job, Hilda.

33:32.410 --> 33:34.110
Thank you, Chef.
I appreciate it.

33:34.110 --> 33:35.210
[Anne] Kara, come on up.

33:35.210 --> 33:37.280
- [Hilda] Come on, Kara.
- [Marti] Girl, you got this.

33:37.910 --> 33:38.840
What happened with the corn?

33:38.850 --> 33:42.950
I accidentally
grabbed Angie's corn.

33:42.950 --> 33:45.920
- But you cooked it.
- Yeah, but she's claiming it.

33:45.920 --> 33:47.790
Angie, I'm doing
you a favor, girl.

33:47.790 --> 33:48.920
Mine looked better anyway.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.760
- This is Kara's corn?
- No, she took it.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.790
- Whose corn is this?
- That was Angie's corn.

33:53.790 --> 33:55.390
Oh, you took it off the grill.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.600
- No.
- No, she took it from right here.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.660
So, now that it's on
her plate, it's her corn.

33:59.670 --> 34:01.400
We'll let Chef Anne decide that.

34:01.400 --> 34:04.200
I mean, it's like I might
have to put these two girls

34:04.200 --> 34:05.570
in separate corners.

34:05.570 --> 34:07.970
Dra-ma! Drama.

34:15.920 --> 34:18.350
- Whose corn is this?
- That was Angie's corn.

34:19.090 --> 34:20.390
This corn is undercooked.

34:21.790 --> 34:23.860
Sharing is caring, Angie.

34:23.860 --> 34:24.790
You did a nice job plating.

34:24.790 --> 34:25.890
Thank you.

34:25.890 --> 34:27.730
[Anne] I think this is
the best plate of food

34:27.730 --> 34:30.000
that you have
given me, thus far.

34:30.000 --> 34:30.860
- Good job.
- Thank you, Chef.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.960
[indistinct cheering]

34:33.070 --> 34:34.930
Angie, come on up.

34:40.010 --> 34:42.210
A lot of crushed red pepper.

34:42.710 --> 34:43.940
[whispers] I like it spicy.

34:43.940 --> 34:44.880
[Anne] A lot of crushed
red pep--

34:44.880 --> 34:46.650
Oh, my God, whoa!

34:46.650 --> 34:48.810
- [Angie] Yeah.
- Like, you're killing me.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.080
Like right in the back
of my throat.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.180
[giggles]

34:52.050 --> 34:53.850
Oops!

34:53.850 --> 34:55.420
So, this is your corn?

34:55.420 --> 34:56.860
Yes.

34:56.860 --> 34:59.020
This corn is a little bit more
cooked than that corn,

34:59.030 --> 34:59.620
I will say.

34:59.690 --> 35:01.760
[grunts]

35:01.760 --> 35:03.560
- [Anne] Your plating however looks nice.
- [Angie] Thank you.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.230
There you go, thank you.

35:05.700 --> 35:07.970
- [Al] Good job, Angie.
- [Hilda] Good job, Ang.

35:07.970 --> 35:11.240
So, the winner of the Skill
Drill challenge this week is

35:11.840 --> 35:12.840
Peachez!

35:12.940 --> 35:16.210
- [all cheering]
- [Cliff] Peachez, great job.

35:16.210 --> 35:19.810
He said my name.
He said, "Peachez."

35:19.810 --> 35:23.250
I am so happy!

35:23.250 --> 35:27.090
The winner of this week's
Skill Drill cook is

35:27.350 --> 35:27.850
Hector!

35:27.860 --> 35:31.160
[all cheering]

35:31.160 --> 35:34.360
That's awesome.
I feel heaven right now.

35:34.790 --> 35:35.990
Cloud nine.

35:40.600 --> 35:41.630
Welcome back, recruits.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.900
We hope you've had
some fun in the sun

35:43.900 --> 35:47.810
because we've got another
Summertime Challenge right on deck.

35:47.810 --> 35:50.310
[Anne] Nothing seems
more like summertime

35:50.310 --> 35:52.510
than firing up the grill.

35:52.510 --> 35:53.810
Oh!

35:53.810 --> 35:57.820
So today, Cliff and I are
gonna each teach you

35:57.820 --> 36:02.450
how to make a grilled fish
dish with a summery side.

36:02.460 --> 36:04.190
[Anne] And not to go overboard,

36:04.190 --> 36:06.960
I think this would be best
served with a summery drink.

36:06.960 --> 36:10.560
- [Anne] Cocktails! Yes!
- Booz-ay!

36:10.560 --> 36:12.000
My Rocking Red Stars, remember,

36:12.000 --> 36:14.500
this is a Red team
elimination week.

36:14.500 --> 36:18.200
So, one of you will be
walking the plank today.

36:19.870 --> 36:23.010
Meanwhile, the recruit with
the best dish on the Blue team

36:23.010 --> 36:25.110
will take home $1,000.

36:25.110 --> 36:26.810
[all clapping]

36:26.810 --> 36:28.010
I'm getting money today.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.120
Red team, step into my office.

36:30.120 --> 36:31.750
Blue team, step into my galley.

36:31.750 --> 36:32.880
Oh, the galley!

36:32.890 --> 36:34.920
I'm gonna teach you how to make

36:34.990 --> 36:38.420
a grilled swordfish with an
olive, pine nut, resin relish.

36:38.430 --> 36:41.060
A grilled romaine salad

36:41.060 --> 36:43.930
as well as a mezcal
strawberry smash.

36:44.830 --> 36:46.730
I am going to be
showing you guys

36:46.730 --> 36:52.040
how to make grilled Mahi-Mahi
with an orzo salad

36:52.040 --> 36:54.410
with a boozy Tuscan lemonade.

36:54.410 --> 36:55.710
Mmm!

36:55.710 --> 36:57.310
[Cliff] First thing we're
gonna do, my sauce.

36:57.310 --> 36:58.910
Pine nuts need to be toasted.

36:58.910 --> 37:01.650
Now I'm gonna start
my mise en place with lemon.

37:01.650 --> 37:03.110
- I'm gonna take its clothes off.
- [gasps]

37:03.120 --> 37:05.020
Run the knife along the outside.

37:05.020 --> 37:05.780
Oh, my gosh.

37:05.790 --> 37:07.990
[Cliff] Just till
I hit the flesh.

37:08.620 --> 37:10.860
This is gonna go on one side.
I'm gonna vee it out.

37:10.860 --> 37:13.090
I'm gonna do that with
the entirety of the lemon.

37:13.090 --> 37:15.830
To the sauce pot,
butter, our best friend,

37:15.830 --> 37:17.400
captain shallot, olives.

37:17.400 --> 37:18.400
I'm gonna add my pine nuts.

37:18.860 --> 37:19.800
My raisins.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.270
We're gonna reduce this.

37:22.030 --> 37:23.000
[Anne] Let's work on sauce.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.140
These garlic cloves
are mostly staying whole.

37:26.140 --> 37:30.010
The juice and zest of one lemon.

37:30.010 --> 37:32.810
Capers and let this cook down

37:32.810 --> 37:35.880
until the lemon juice has
reduced by about half.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.150
We have our lettuce.

37:37.150 --> 37:38.420
Guess where this is going?

37:38.420 --> 37:39.950
On the grill.

37:39.950 --> 37:42.320
Welcome to the church
of vegetables.

37:42.790 --> 37:44.060
"Lettuce" pray.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.830
So ow this, chary char char.

37:46.830 --> 37:48.860
Get that other side toasty.

37:48.860 --> 37:50.700
Nice and grilled, smokey smokey.

37:50.700 --> 37:51.700
Now, I'm gonna cut my lettuce.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.400
About inch and a half pieces.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.030
And everything,
goes right in the bowl.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.000
My vinaigrette, radishes.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.900
I'm gonna gently toss my salad.

37:58.910 --> 37:59.970
[Anne] Now, orzo salad.

37:59.970 --> 38:02.970
When we're talking about
cooking green vegetables,

38:02.980 --> 38:07.380
we think about
the blanch and shock.

38:07.380 --> 38:11.780
We cook our green vegetable
in the boiling salty water

38:11.790 --> 38:14.950
and then we go
directly into ice water.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.090
All right in there.

38:16.090 --> 38:19.860
This one is a really fast
in the water and right out.

38:19.860 --> 38:23.960
I'm going to use that same
water to cook my orzo in.

38:23.960 --> 38:26.030
Now, I'm gonna think
about the other stuff

38:26.030 --> 38:29.570
that I want to put
in my orzo salad.

38:29.570 --> 38:32.040
These are like the base on which

38:32.040 --> 38:34.740
so many big flavors
are built on.

38:34.740 --> 38:36.110
This is ready.

38:36.710 --> 38:38.140
Be sure to get it all.

38:38.150 --> 38:40.010
Because let's just
make it right in here.

38:40.010 --> 38:41.750
I'm gonna add my onions.

38:41.750 --> 38:43.110
My garlic, tomatoes.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.650
I have cannellini beans.

38:44.650 --> 38:45.920
My broccoli rabe.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.990
I'm gonna chop
this up a little bit.

38:47.990 --> 38:48.790
Orzo is done.

38:48.790 --> 38:49.820
Our fish.

38:49.820 --> 38:52.120
We have this fish. Mahi-Mahi.

38:52.130 --> 38:53.290
Olive oil, salt. pepper.

38:53.860 --> 38:55.160
[Anne] We lay it down gently.

38:55.160 --> 38:56.290
[Cliff] Ready for this?

38:57.700 --> 38:59.060
My thermometer.

38:59.070 --> 39:01.870
We're gonna take the temperature
in the thickest part of the fish.

39:01.870 --> 39:05.000
Between 130 and 140,

39:05.010 --> 39:06.770
take it off and then
we'll just let it rest.

39:06.770 --> 39:08.670
Oh, wait, there's more.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.880
Because we have
a cocktail to make.

39:10.880 --> 39:12.610
Does a shot count as a cocktail?

39:12.610 --> 39:14.850
- [laughing]
- [Anne] No.

39:14.850 --> 39:18.950
I'm making a simple syrup
infused with rosemary and thyme.

39:18.950 --> 39:20.190
Equal parts.

39:20.820 --> 39:21.950
Sugar and water.

39:21.960 --> 39:25.420
And I'm just heating it up
until the sugar dissolves

39:25.430 --> 39:27.590
and let it sort
of steep like tea.

39:27.590 --> 39:29.930
I'm gonna quarter
the strawberries.

39:29.930 --> 39:31.330
Get all our strawberries
in at once.

39:31.800 --> 39:33.100
Basil.

39:33.100 --> 39:34.400
I'm gonna take this bad boy.

39:34.400 --> 39:37.400
This is gonna break up
the strawberry and the basil.

39:37.400 --> 39:38.870
And infuse the flavors together.

39:38.870 --> 39:41.570
Agave. Mezcal.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.810
I'm gonna top it with club soda.

39:42.810 --> 39:45.740
Nothing says "Drink me"
like an umbrella.

39:45.750 --> 39:47.950
[Anne] I'm gonna
juice two lemons.

39:47.950 --> 39:50.580
I'm gonna add
simple syrup to this.

39:50.580 --> 39:51.880
Bring out the fun stuff.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.990
Vodka. Shake it
around for a sec.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.960
Here we go. Tuscan lemonade.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.190
Let's start plating.

39:59.190 --> 40:01.190
[Cliff] My swordfish
and then this.

40:01.760 --> 40:02.860
My salad here.

40:02.960 --> 40:04.860
And then I'll finish the top
with a little feta cheese.

40:04.930 --> 40:06.230
Here we go.

40:07.070 --> 40:08.630
Gonna lean my
fish right on there.

40:08.640 --> 40:09.800
My sauce.

40:09.800 --> 40:12.270
<i>And go right around. Voila!
You guys wanna try it?</i>

40:13.040 --> 40:14.070
Thank you, Chef.

40:14.070 --> 40:15.240
That's yummy.

40:15.240 --> 40:17.040
Oh, the fish is good.

40:18.140 --> 40:19.080
[coughs]

40:19.080 --> 40:22.250
All right recruits,
you have 75 minutes...

40:22.250 --> 40:24.880
To recreate my fish and sauce...

40:24.890 --> 40:27.950
And put your own spin
on a grilled side dish...

40:27.950 --> 40:30.190
And your own
urban fused cocktail.

40:30.460 --> 40:31.020
Time has started.

40:31.020 --> 40:32.720
Oh no!

40:32.730 --> 40:34.390
[Marti] Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

40:38.160 --> 40:40.230
Right... right here
with you, hon.

40:41.300 --> 40:42.430
Behind you.

40:43.840 --> 40:46.040
<i>♪ That's gonna be
So good in my drink ♪</i>

40:46.040 --> 40:47.410
Nice and organized.

40:47.410 --> 40:48.640
<i>♪ Hey yeah ♪</i>

40:48.640 --> 40:50.910
I want this $1,000 so bad.

40:50.910 --> 40:52.340
You know what?
If we stay focused,

40:52.450 --> 40:53.850
you're getting it.

40:53.980 --> 40:57.520
But ultimately, you just are gonna
get a beautiful completed plate.

40:57.520 --> 40:59.120
We're not worried
about this money.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.550
[Melody] Speak for
yourself on the money.

41:00.550 --> 41:01.520
[giggles]

41:03.460 --> 41:05.760
[Hilda] Awesome!
I'm getting so good at this.

41:05.760 --> 41:08.260
Look at the onions. See
the hair? That's a wiggly hair.

41:08.260 --> 41:11.000
<i>Now, cut the butt off, zap!</i>

41:11.230 --> 41:12.860
Hilda...

41:12.870 --> 41:14.770
Claw on top of
that onion. Yeah!

41:14.770 --> 41:15.670
There you go!

41:15.670 --> 41:17.240
Hold that head still.

41:17.240 --> 41:19.740
And then just chop,
chop, chop, chop, chop.

41:19.740 --> 41:20.770
<i>Done.</i>

41:20.770 --> 41:22.840
Hilda, did you nail your onion?

41:22.840 --> 41:24.680
I'm nailing it now, baby.

41:24.680 --> 41:25.680
Yeah!

41:25.680 --> 41:27.780
Perfect. Happy with this.

41:27.780 --> 41:30.380
My strategy going
into this challenge

41:30.380 --> 41:33.890
<i>is to get everything put
together as fast as I can</i>

41:33.890 --> 41:35.990
and then take my time
with the cocktails

41:35.990 --> 41:38.420
since that's the element
I'm mostly unsure about.

41:38.430 --> 41:39.420
Need to do my shallot.

41:40.590 --> 41:42.160
<i>[Cheyenne] I'm cutting
the shallots.</i>

41:42.160 --> 41:44.930
Really going to town
on them when bang!

41:45.760 --> 41:46.970
Oh, I cut myself.

41:46.970 --> 41:47.900
I'm bleeding.

41:47.900 --> 41:48.970
Medic!

41:50.870 --> 41:52.000
[grunts]

41:52.010 --> 41:52.540
[Cliff] You okay, Cheyenne?

41:52.540 --> 41:53.970
Yeah,

41:53.970 --> 41:55.940
<i>[Cheyenne] Right out the gate,
I've already nicked my hand</i>

41:55.940 --> 41:57.640
<i>and I'm waiting on a medic.</i>

41:57.640 --> 42:00.140
I don't know if I'm gonna have
time to get this dish done.

42:00.150 --> 42:01.710
[Cheyenne] Yeah. Both fingers.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.010
Right on my knuckles.

42:09.790 --> 42:14.330
Everybody,
we got one hour left! Ow!

42:29.210 --> 42:30.880
Oh, I cut myself.

42:30.880 --> 42:32.080
I'm bleeding.

42:32.780 --> 42:34.680
This is not a good start.

42:34.680 --> 42:36.710
Both fingers.
Right on my knuckles.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.350
Oh no! Cheyenne,
are you all right?

42:38.780 --> 42:40.750
- Delightful.
- Delightful.

42:40.750 --> 42:42.990
It's delightful when
I cut myself, right?

42:42.990 --> 42:44.290
[Cheyenne] Nothing
but a scratch.

42:44.620 --> 42:45.660
Okay, thank you.

42:45.660 --> 42:48.160
<i>[Cheyenne] This is costing
me so much time.</i>

42:48.160 --> 42:49.760
But I will complete this cook.

42:49.760 --> 42:50.700
Hell or high water.

42:50.700 --> 42:52.860
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

42:52.870 --> 42:54.930
Great news, it was the hand
I don't usually use, so...

42:55.000 --> 42:56.230
[laughs]

42:58.770 --> 42:59.370
Oh, I love you.

42:59.940 --> 43:00.710
Come on, honey.

43:00.710 --> 43:02.840
Get bubbly, girl.

43:02.840 --> 43:06.010
There is so much happening
in this 75-minute cook.

43:06.010 --> 43:09.710
<i>We have to make
a Mahi-Mahi, orzo salad.</i>

43:09.720 --> 43:10.780
<i>Our own version.</i>

43:10.780 --> 43:13.380
Not even the one that
Chef Anne taught us.

43:13.390 --> 43:15.990
<i>Get a sauce together,
make a mocktail.</i>

43:15.990 --> 43:17.590
Mise en place, mise en place.

43:17.590 --> 43:19.790
That sounds like a song
almost, "mise en place."

43:19.790 --> 43:21.730
What are you gonna
flavor your orzo with?

43:21.730 --> 43:25.030
I'm going to use
tomatoes and jalapeño

43:25.030 --> 43:26.860
with broccoli rabe
I'm gonna saute.

43:26.870 --> 43:27.870
All right, sounds yummy.

43:27.870 --> 43:29.630
I am putting my blinders on

43:29.640 --> 43:32.070
<i>and the only person
in this kitchen is me.</i>

43:32.070 --> 43:34.810
Ooh, these onions
are making me tear up. Ooh!

43:34.810 --> 43:37.080
Do not fall off, eye lashes.

43:37.740 --> 43:39.980
Don't be afraid to season
aggressively, my friend.

43:39.980 --> 43:41.880
In the past,
I know I've messed up.

43:41.880 --> 43:43.780
[Eddie] I cut myself, I did it.

43:43.780 --> 43:45.920
- [Cliff] Throw your hand up.
- Medic.

43:45.920 --> 43:46.880
Is this yours or mine?
This is mine, isn't it?

43:46.890 --> 43:48.550
That's yours.

43:48.560 --> 43:50.860
[Cliff] This looks like
a complete rush hack job.

43:50.860 --> 43:52.860
- [Eddie] Chef Cliff...
- Eddie, talk to me.

43:52.860 --> 43:54.630
Do I put the chicken back
in here and cover it?

43:54.630 --> 43:56.130
What is that?

43:56.960 --> 44:01.900
I want him to know that I am
his most coachable recruit.

44:01.900 --> 44:03.870
Chef Cliff,
is this ready to flip?

44:03.870 --> 44:06.000
- What do you think?
- You know...

44:06.010 --> 44:08.740
I'm not second
guessing myself here.

44:08.740 --> 44:10.070
[Cliff] All right, I like that.

44:10.080 --> 44:11.910
Come here, come here.

44:11.910 --> 44:12.980
Chest bump, baby!

44:13.210 --> 44:14.180
Yes!

44:14.180 --> 44:15.750
Now, finish.

44:15.750 --> 44:17.420
<i>[Eddie] I almost
made it to Chef Cliff.</i>

44:18.280 --> 44:20.050
Not quite but it felt good.

44:20.050 --> 44:21.920
Okay, calm down, Edward.

44:21.920 --> 44:25.660
Ah, fish. Fish, fish, fish.

44:25.660 --> 44:27.690
I grew up fishing
so I eat a lot of fish

44:27.690 --> 44:29.990
since I've been
a little kid, so...

44:32.460 --> 44:35.800
Have I tried making fish?
I tried one time.

44:35.800 --> 44:39.000
And I damn near burned my
grandmother's house down.

44:42.840 --> 44:46.380
So like... Let's see
how this goes. [giggles]

44:49.380 --> 44:51.420
They're horizontal
but they're grill marks.

44:52.990 --> 44:55.150
Oh, I don't like this at all.

44:55.160 --> 44:56.990
- Oh boy!
- Use a smaller knife.

44:56.990 --> 44:58.790
Smaller knife. Smaller knife.

44:58.790 --> 44:59.860
Use a smaller knife.
Look at that.

44:59.860 --> 45:02.430
[Peachez] That's gonna be
so much easier to control.

45:02.430 --> 45:04.830
Okay. This feels like
anatomy class to me.

45:04.830 --> 45:07.800
I feel like I am
<i>on Grey's Anatomy.</i>

45:07.800 --> 45:09.270
I am a doctor, honey.

45:09.740 --> 45:11.900
I'mma save a life today.

45:11.910 --> 45:14.040
<i>[telephonic voice] Paging
Dr. Peachez. Dr. Peachez.</i>

45:14.040 --> 45:15.940
<i>Your car is about to be towed.</i>

45:15.940 --> 45:18.810
[Peachez] Pop out.
Goodbye, pith!

45:18.810 --> 45:21.150
Next time I write
a romance novel,

45:21.150 --> 45:22.980
that's the name of my villain.

45:22.980 --> 45:24.980
The Bitter Pith.

45:24.980 --> 45:27.250
[evil laugh]

45:27.250 --> 45:29.050
It's me, Pith.

45:29.060 --> 45:31.420
Ahh...

45:32.020 --> 45:33.660
I did it. Whoo!

45:33.660 --> 45:36.090
What about the grill marks, Ang?

45:36.100 --> 45:38.260
Anne told us the grill
marks should be an X.

45:38.260 --> 45:39.860
Put it on ten and two.

45:39.870 --> 45:40.770
Ugh!

45:40.770 --> 45:41.830
<i>I'm pretty good
at reading a clock.</i>

45:41.830 --> 45:44.300
So, it went this way,
so it needs to go this way.

45:44.300 --> 45:47.070
But I'm really awkward when
it came to flipping my fish.

45:48.270 --> 45:50.310
Oh no, wait. I gotta turn it
over on the same side.

45:52.380 --> 45:54.850
<i>I got it off two
and I gotta get it on ten.</i>

45:54.850 --> 45:56.080
[Angie grunting]

45:56.820 --> 45:58.750
Where does it go?

45:58.750 --> 46:01.050
These lines go this way,
I need to make them this way.

46:01.190 --> 46:02.420
It's just not happening.

46:02.420 --> 46:03.820
[groans]

46:03.820 --> 46:05.960
Please please, let's focus.
Let's focus.

46:05.990 --> 46:07.260
Okay.

46:08.860 --> 46:09.860
[Cliff] Bianca, don't do that.

46:09.860 --> 46:11.300
- [Bianca] I--
- A-ha! I saw you.

46:11.630 --> 46:12.960
I saw you.

46:12.970 --> 46:15.800
I've attempted to cook
fish in the past.

46:15.800 --> 46:20.000
<i>We had a barbeque and I didn't
think it was possible</i>

46:20.010 --> 46:22.970
<i>to set your house
on fire from outside.</i>

46:23.940 --> 46:25.240
You turned the flame down, yes?

46:25.250 --> 46:26.080
Yes, I did.

46:26.080 --> 46:29.350
The flames were like... vroom!

46:29.350 --> 46:30.550
It-- [sighs in exasperation]

46:30.550 --> 46:33.180
Thank goodness, my mom
is like my savior

46:33.190 --> 46:36.090
because she saved me
from my disasters.

46:36.090 --> 46:37.890
She's like FEMA, you know?

46:37.890 --> 46:38.920
Okay, go.

46:38.930 --> 46:40.220
Yeah, wait. You see that?

46:40.230 --> 46:42.630
The fish just gave...
It gave itself to you.

46:42.630 --> 46:43.800
Quarter turn.

46:43.800 --> 46:45.100
Life it up and then turn it.

46:47.870 --> 46:49.130
[Bianca] Thank you.

46:50.900 --> 46:53.070
We're not in our
mother's kitchen.

46:53.070 --> 46:54.840
Use a real kitchen utensil.

46:54.840 --> 46:56.770
I think I'm in a good gear.

46:56.780 --> 46:58.780
Details, details, you guys.

46:58.780 --> 47:00.780
All right? I know you
can do this. Okay?

47:00.780 --> 47:02.380
Not all the way up to two

47:02.380 --> 47:03.880
but I think I got
things moving already.

47:03.880 --> 47:06.750
<i>Orzo's there, I got my fish.</i>

47:06.750 --> 47:09.190
<i>I just gotta get
the caper sauce running.</i>

47:09.190 --> 47:10.990
<i>I put the oil.</i>

47:12.420 --> 47:13.290
[Anne] Careful.

47:13.290 --> 47:14.330
Ooh!

47:14.830 --> 47:15.430
Whoo!

47:15.730 --> 47:18.500
Fire. Fire.

47:18.500 --> 47:20.700
[Hector] Burning
everything over here.

47:20.700 --> 47:23.070
<i>I am gonna use an eyebrow
one of these days.</i>

47:23.070 --> 47:24.740
Get a new pan, start over.

47:24.740 --> 47:25.800
Can I not clean it?

47:25.810 --> 47:27.910
[Hector] I don't have
<i>time to get a pan.</i>

47:27.910 --> 47:30.040
So, I am just gonna
clean this sucker over

47:30.040 --> 47:31.810
and just try to
do something with it.

47:31.810 --> 47:34.880
Quick, quick, quick, Hector.
All right? Commit to it.

47:34.880 --> 47:37.950
<i>[Hector] I was cruising.
But this sauce, man.</i>

47:37.950 --> 47:40.820
<i>It got me all riled up.</i>

47:40.820 --> 47:42.290
This thing is not looking good.

47:43.090 --> 47:43.960
Melody and Peachez...

47:43.960 --> 47:44.860
[Melody and Peachez] Yes.

47:44.860 --> 47:46.190
[Cliff] Fish flip, please.

47:47.930 --> 47:50.800
Peachez, Peachez,
go from the side.

47:50.800 --> 47:51.800
You see the way the grill
grates are going?

47:51.800 --> 47:54.170
-Yeah.
-[Cliff] Follow that. So, yeah.

47:55.670 --> 47:58.000
- [Cliff] Thank you. Beautiful.
- [Peachez] Oh!

47:58.000 --> 48:01.270
Those are some
sexy grill marks, baby!

48:01.940 --> 48:05.110
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

48:05.110 --> 48:07.350
- [chuckles]
- [Cliff] Melody, same thing.

48:08.750 --> 48:10.250
Flip it, flip it.

48:11.020 --> 48:12.420
[Cliff] Flip. Thank you.

48:13.050 --> 48:14.550
It's good. I got it.

48:14.550 --> 48:15.920
Both of them look beautiful.

48:15.920 --> 48:19.360
-Because brown food what?
-[Melody and Peachez] Tastes good.

48:20.390 --> 48:21.560
[Angie] So, I'm making
sundried tomato,

48:21.560 --> 48:24.800
artichoke and squash orzo.

48:24.800 --> 48:28.670
I buy pre-made orzo salad at
the grocery store all the time.

48:28.670 --> 48:30.330
Al, do I put
the tomatoes in cold?

48:31.040 --> 48:32.270
I put the tomatoes in, right?

48:32.940 --> 48:34.610
Uh, I'm not sure.

48:34.610 --> 48:36.940
So, I'm gonna
replicate that here.

48:36.940 --> 48:39.310
<i>I'm cutting this onion
and all of a sudden...</i>

48:45.780 --> 48:46.920
Wha-what?-what?

48:46.920 --> 48:48.620
[Anne] Everyday now.

48:48.620 --> 48:49.850
[Angie] I just wanted
you to come visit me.

48:49.860 --> 48:51.820
- I'm right here with you.
- [chuckling]

48:51.820 --> 48:53.590
This is all my
master plan, Chef Anne,

48:53.590 --> 48:55.330
for you and I to
be just best friends.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.000
This is basil that
I am chopping up

48:59.000 --> 49:01.570
because I am putting a twist
on this vinaigrette, baby!

49:01.570 --> 49:05.000
And it is going to be delicious.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.810
One part acid, two parts fat.
One part acid, two parts fat.

49:09.810 --> 49:13.180
<i>[Peachez] I have many hits
on my imaginary album.</i>

49:13.180 --> 49:14.950
<i>But the piece de resistance</i>

49:15.010 --> 49:16.180
is gonna be...

49:17.280 --> 49:18.620
<i>♪ Acid and fat ♪</i>

49:18.620 --> 49:19.650
<i>♪ Mmm, mmm ♪</i>

49:19.650 --> 49:21.520
<i>♪ Acid and fat
Mmm, mmm ♪</i>

49:21.520 --> 49:24.020
<i>♪ You like acid?
Well, I'm fat ♪</i>

49:24.020 --> 49:26.420
<i>♪ I like acid and fat
Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪</i>

49:27.830 --> 49:29.030
Work.

49:29.190 --> 49:30.730
That's a vinaigrette, honey.

49:30.730 --> 49:32.960
[Hilda] Scrap,
little, burnt [bleep].

49:33.670 --> 49:35.170
<i>[Hilda] As I'm stirring my orzo,</i>

49:35.170 --> 49:37.770
<i>I notice on the bottom
of that pot,</i>

49:37.770 --> 49:38.640
<i>it's burnt!</i>

49:38.640 --> 49:41.870
Oh, my goodness,
I gotta take care of this.

49:41.870 --> 49:43.870
[Hilda] That's some burnt
stuff going on in here, Chef.

49:43.880 --> 49:46.940
<i>Every time I do something
wrong, Chef Anne...</i>

49:47.880 --> 49:49.880
She comes right
behind me, you know?

49:49.880 --> 49:51.080
Like a... Like a tick.

49:51.080 --> 49:53.020
Some burnt stuff? Oh!

49:53.020 --> 49:54.450
I don't want that in there.

49:54.450 --> 49:56.050
I don't want you to taste that.

49:56.920 --> 49:58.590
[mouths] She's right there.
Shh. Don't tell her.

49:58.590 --> 50:00.620
I need to get that out of there.

50:00.630 --> 50:02.660
- Maybe I should-- - Why don't
you just go and get a new pan?

50:02.660 --> 50:05.100
I think I'll do that.
Thank you, Chef Anne.

50:05.800 --> 50:07.830
Don't try to hide it.
She's gonna find it.

50:07.830 --> 50:10.170
I burnt some rice by accident

50:10.170 --> 50:12.840
and I just cannot have
the chef tasting that.

50:12.840 --> 50:15.010
Hello, are you grilling it?

50:15.010 --> 50:17.640
[Cheyenne] Yeah. I...
Actually, my family,

50:17.640 --> 50:19.780
in the summertime
and what we eat is

50:19.780 --> 50:22.810
salty cucumber and watermelon,
like at the pool.

50:22.820 --> 50:24.450
[Cliff] Are we grilling
the cucumber too?

50:24.450 --> 50:27.920
[Cheyenne] Yeah, cucumbers and
watermelon are both getting grilled.

50:27.920 --> 50:30.020
We're gonna try it out. Never
done it but you know what?

50:30.020 --> 50:31.760
I love this. I love this.

50:31.760 --> 50:32.920
We're gonna be creative today.

50:32.930 --> 50:33.620
[Cliff] I love it.

50:33.630 --> 50:35.560
[Cheyenne] Ten minutes left.

50:35.560 --> 50:39.830
Rocking Red Stars, I want
you guys to finish up strong.

50:39.830 --> 50:41.870
Come on, little sauce.
Let's get going, let's go.

50:41.900 --> 50:43.300
Come on.

50:43.300 --> 50:45.770
I've got my pan
all nice and garlic-y.

50:45.770 --> 50:48.110
[Kara] Okay,
lemon juice and capers.

50:48.110 --> 50:50.240
<i>I go to add my lemon juice.</i>

50:51.010 --> 50:52.280
Oh, shoot!

50:53.550 --> 50:55.880
Whoosh!

50:55.880 --> 50:58.050
I think my chances
of staying at boot camp

50:58.050 --> 51:00.250
<i>just went up in flames.</i>

51:06.690 --> 51:07.590
[Kara] Oh, shoot!

51:09.030 --> 51:11.830
Oh, my God, my wig
almost went up, girl!

51:11.830 --> 51:13.130
Sorry. Sorry, Marti.

51:13.130 --> 51:14.370
[imitates whooshing sound]

51:14.370 --> 51:15.470
Are you guys all right?

51:15.470 --> 51:18.970
Yes, baby! I'm feeling good.
You got me feeling alive.

51:18.970 --> 51:20.940
[giggles] All right, now you
can put it back on the fire.

51:20.940 --> 51:21.940
Fire's hot.

51:21.940 --> 51:24.080
- [Anne] Got it a little hot.
- [Kara] Got it.

51:24.080 --> 51:26.380
Recruits, five minutes!

51:26.380 --> 51:27.410
Don't forget the cocktail.

51:35.490 --> 51:37.820
I need some more alcohol.

51:37.820 --> 51:41.130
If you are muddling, pretend
you are angry with the fruit.

51:43.100 --> 51:44.400
Oh, that was a little strong.

51:45.060 --> 51:46.230
[giggles]

51:46.600 --> 51:48.170
One for the fallen...

51:48.570 --> 51:50.400
comrades here
<i>at the Worst Cooks.</i>

51:52.040 --> 51:54.110
Can I drink this whole thing
and make another one?

51:56.410 --> 51:57.370
[Eddie] I got this.

51:58.180 --> 52:00.480
[Anne] All right,
we have one minute left.

52:00.480 --> 52:02.950
Plate, plate, plate.

52:02.950 --> 52:05.420
[Cliff] If there is something
you are not pleased with,

52:05.420 --> 52:06.420
make it right.

52:11.020 --> 52:12.090
It's pretty good.

52:14.430 --> 52:16.060
[bleep]

52:16.130 --> 52:17.260
Oh no!

52:19.870 --> 52:21.400
Cheyenne, what happened?

52:21.400 --> 52:24.670
I drank out of my glass
instead of using a spoon.

52:24.670 --> 52:27.400
Okay. Well, you got a minute.
Do it again.

52:27.410 --> 52:29.840
I have faith in you.
You can do this.

52:29.840 --> 52:31.180
[Eddie] I'm sorry.
Go, go, go, go.

52:31.180 --> 52:32.080
[Cheyenne] Anybody
have a muddler?

52:32.080 --> 52:33.180
Here, here, here.

52:33.180 --> 52:34.310
[Cheyenne] Thank you, baby.

52:35.480 --> 52:36.750
25 seconds.

52:36.750 --> 52:38.850
- [Cheyenne] Herbs, herbs.
- [Peachez] What kinda herbs?

52:38.850 --> 52:40.280
[Cheyenne] Any kind
at this point.

52:41.620 --> 52:43.950
Muddle, [bleep].
I mean, girl.

52:45.860 --> 52:50.730
[Cliff and Anne] Five, four,
three, two, one.

52:50.730 --> 52:52.130
[Anne] That's it, hands up!

52:52.130 --> 52:55.130
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You're good. You're good.

52:55.130 --> 52:56.000
[Cheyenne] I'm not good.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
[Peachez and Eddie cheering]

53:01.970 --> 53:04.010
Can I have what they had?

53:04.040 --> 53:05.380
We're happy over here.

53:05.980 --> 53:08.110
Let's go try some fish.

53:08.110 --> 53:09.580
- Let's go it.
- And a cocktail.

53:09.580 --> 53:10.510
I'm ready for a cocktail.

53:10.520 --> 53:12.780
I need a beverage
right now, Chef.

53:12.790 --> 53:15.090
Recruits, let's see
how you did. Bianca.

53:15.090 --> 53:16.390
What's your cocktail?

53:16.390 --> 53:18.660
Blackberry, mint and vodka.

53:18.660 --> 53:20.090
That is definitely tequila.

53:20.090 --> 53:21.430
- Yes, tequila. I'm sorry.
- [Cliff] Tequila.

53:22.760 --> 53:23.360
The cocktail's delicious.

53:24.100 --> 53:25.060
Our swordfish.

53:25.730 --> 53:27.230
The swordfish
is cooked very well.

53:27.800 --> 53:28.770
That's freaking delicious.

53:28.770 --> 53:30.700
I'm really,
really proud of this fish.

53:30.700 --> 53:32.100
I'm so proud of myself.

53:32.100 --> 53:33.740
- Peachez, come and teach me.
- Me?

53:33.740 --> 53:34.870
[Peachez] The cocktail...

53:34.870 --> 53:38.880
you've got mezcal,
jalapeño, cilantro,

53:38.880 --> 53:42.580
lime juice, ooh,
it's a party in your mouth.

53:42.580 --> 53:45.750
It's actually surprisingly good.

53:45.750 --> 53:48.890
You know, I knew I gave
him what he needed.

53:48.890 --> 53:50.390
The texture of the fish...

53:51.690 --> 53:52.960
it's an A.

53:52.960 --> 53:54.860
It tastes great
and it's seasoned very well.

53:54.860 --> 53:56.960
What is our grilled salad?

53:56.960 --> 53:59.930
Grilled romaine, strawberry,
roasted walnuts

53:59.930 --> 54:03.000
and feta cheese
with a basil vinaigrette.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.900
It's seasoned very well.

54:04.900 --> 54:08.340
That $1,000 is in the bag, baby!

54:09.270 --> 54:10.470
Eddie, please join me.

54:10.480 --> 54:12.080
Oh, this is challenging.

54:12.080 --> 54:15.810
<i>♪ There he is
Eddie bringing me food ♪</i>

54:15.820 --> 54:17.010
What's in this cocktail?

54:17.020 --> 54:19.820
Mezcal, two raspberries,
two strawberries.

54:19.820 --> 54:20.880
Also, thyme.

54:20.890 --> 54:22.290
There's just a lot of thyme.

54:22.950 --> 54:24.260
Your proportions are off.

54:25.660 --> 54:26.920
All the ingredients made it

54:26.930 --> 54:28.990
and the fish itself
is seasoned very well

54:29.000 --> 54:30.390
and the sauce is
seasoned very well.

54:30.400 --> 54:31.660
- Thank you.
- Great.

54:31.660 --> 54:32.830
Great freaking job.

54:32.830 --> 54:34.500
That is what we call growth.

54:34.500 --> 54:35.870
Melody, come hither.

54:35.870 --> 54:37.940
<i>[Melody] I'm feeling
really strong for the tasting.</i>

54:37.940 --> 54:41.040
My drink tastes A1.
I got this.

54:41.040 --> 54:44.410
In the cocktail,
it's raspberries, mint,

54:44.410 --> 54:46.640
vodka and seltzer.

54:46.650 --> 54:47.950
That's delicious.

54:48.850 --> 54:50.210
Temperature on the fish, A plus.

54:50.220 --> 54:51.520
Seasoning on the fish, C.

54:51.520 --> 54:52.480
Why C?

54:52.480 --> 54:54.390
- Not enough salt.
- Maybe I'm scared of salt.

54:54.390 --> 54:58.020
I never know if I should add
more salt or less salt.

54:58.020 --> 55:00.560
- Welcome salt into your life.
- Welcome the salt.

55:00.560 --> 55:01.590
Cheyenne, come here.

55:01.590 --> 55:04.700
Blue team has done great.
I may be the downfall.

55:04.700 --> 55:06.660
<i>[Cheyenne] Looking at
my plate and my cocktail,</i>

55:06.670 --> 55:08.000
things aren't looking too good.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.030
The seasoning on
the fish is a C.

55:10.040 --> 55:11.970
Okay. More salt?

55:11.970 --> 55:13.800
- Yes. The crime scene...
- Okay. [laughs]

55:13.810 --> 55:16.070
lies within the cocktail

55:16.080 --> 55:18.880
because some of
the cocktail is splattered

55:18.880 --> 55:20.240
on the plate.

55:20.250 --> 55:23.250
It's true. I did it, Your Honor.
I murdered this cocktail.

55:24.680 --> 55:25.720
[coughs]

55:25.720 --> 55:27.120
That is straight vodka.

55:27.120 --> 55:29.550
The salad, visually,
this is dope.

55:29.560 --> 55:30.920
Thank you.

55:30.920 --> 55:32.360
[Cliff] The texture
of the fish...

55:32.890 --> 55:34.120
- it's an A.
- Oh, yay!

55:34.130 --> 55:36.690
All right, my Rocking Red Stars.

55:36.700 --> 55:38.760
Hector, you're up first.

55:38.760 --> 55:42.800
My cocktail is a rum
infused with mint.

55:42.800 --> 55:46.070
I put two straws there so you
can enjoy it with somebody else.

55:46.070 --> 55:47.100
Was that you and me?

55:47.710 --> 55:48.810
Maybe.

55:48.840 --> 55:51.410
I gotta get her into the mood.

55:51.410 --> 55:55.750
Your cocktail I will say is
a hair on the sweet side.

55:55.750 --> 55:57.850
Talk to me about what you made.

55:57.850 --> 56:00.680
The orzo salad, I added
olives, cherry tomatoes,

56:00.690 --> 56:02.520
and baby spinach.

56:02.520 --> 56:05.660
All good things that
go along with the mahi

56:05.660 --> 56:08.730
but I feel like the orzo
feels a bit greasy.

56:08.730 --> 56:12.130
And your fish is cooked nicely

56:12.130 --> 56:14.400
but we had some
trouble with the sauce.

56:14.400 --> 56:15.670
It burned, yes.

56:15.670 --> 56:18.870
You know, this is where
the first gear situation

56:18.870 --> 56:20.800
- comes into play.
- [sighs]

56:20.810 --> 56:21.810
Hilda, come on up.

56:21.810 --> 56:23.710
[chuckles]

56:23.710 --> 56:26.040
So, talk to me about what
you did with your orzo.

56:26.050 --> 56:28.580
I have the green onions, tomato.

56:28.580 --> 56:29.950
And I roasted a pepper.

56:29.950 --> 56:34.150
Your orzo is almost
exactly like mine.

56:34.150 --> 56:36.050
- Right.
- Your fish is hammered.

56:36.060 --> 56:37.390
Like cooked to death.

56:37.390 --> 56:40.820
Holy hell, did you
really mess this up?

56:40.830 --> 56:41.830
All right, talk to me
about your cocktail.

56:41.830 --> 56:45.800
Vodka with sugar
and water and lemon.

56:45.800 --> 56:48.130
So, basically it was
just like mine as well.

56:48.130 --> 56:49.730
I didn't try hard enough.

56:49.740 --> 56:50.830
Oh, my gosh!

56:50.840 --> 56:53.800
- You have way more in you than that.
- I do.

56:53.810 --> 56:57.210
I really need to see you
a lot more focused.

56:57.210 --> 56:59.680
I'm feeling very nervous.

56:59.680 --> 57:01.410
One of us is going home.

57:01.410 --> 57:03.250
And I'm hoping it's not me.

57:09.720 --> 57:12.160
Angie, come on up.

57:12.160 --> 57:14.630
Your fish, we missed
the cross hatches

57:14.630 --> 57:15.860
of the grill marks.

57:15.860 --> 57:16.830
- Remember ten to two?
- One one side. Yes.

57:16.830 --> 57:18.960
Talk to me about what
you put in your orzo.

57:18.960 --> 57:22.670
Sundried tomatoes,
zucchini, garlic, onion.

57:22.670 --> 57:24.670
Oh and there's
artichokes in there too.

57:24.670 --> 57:27.140
The flavor direction that you
went in was really good.

57:27.140 --> 57:28.970
Your fish is a hair
on the dry side.

57:28.970 --> 57:29.940
Figured that.

57:29.940 --> 57:33.580
The wheels were,
you know, wobbly.

57:33.580 --> 57:34.750
But you got them
back on the wagon.

57:34.750 --> 57:36.750
- Yeah.
- [Anne] Big Al, come on up.

57:36.750 --> 57:38.680
Come on, Al.
Wiggle those hips, baby.

57:38.680 --> 57:41.080
Marti has been hounding
me to shake my hips.

57:41.590 --> 57:44.920
- [Anne] Oh, there we go.
- Okay, just once.

57:44.920 --> 57:45.920
Right there. That's it, Marti.
That's all you get.

57:45.930 --> 57:49.490
I made orzo with fresh cucumber,

57:49.500 --> 57:51.830
roasted eggplant,
tomatoes, onions and garlic.

57:51.830 --> 57:54.730
I like what you did
with the grilled eggplant.

57:54.730 --> 57:57.230
Your orzo is seasoned nicely.

57:57.240 --> 57:58.640
Your fish is cooked nicely.

57:58.640 --> 58:00.040
What's up with your sauce?

58:00.040 --> 58:03.670
We're missing capers.
I don't see any chives.

58:03.680 --> 58:04.810
I did not plate them.

58:04.810 --> 58:05.840
[Anne] What's your cocktail?

58:05.850 --> 58:08.250
Mint infused vodka
and I used a simple syrup

58:08.250 --> 58:09.680
for the mint to seep into.

58:09.750 --> 58:10.810
So sweet.

58:11.220 --> 58:14.020
You could have really
toned down that simple syrup.

58:14.020 --> 58:14.790
Oops!

58:14.790 --> 58:16.850
All right, Kara. Come on up.

58:16.860 --> 58:20.860
Well, my orzo has black
beans and roasted pepper

58:20.860 --> 58:22.660
and garlic and onions.

58:22.660 --> 58:24.860
Your orzo is seasoned
very nicely.

58:24.860 --> 58:26.700
Your fish is very nicely cooked.

58:26.700 --> 58:27.830
Your sauce... Ooh!

58:27.830 --> 58:30.000
That is very bright lemon.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.700
Wants to take
the enamel off your teeth.

58:31.700 --> 58:33.000
Talk to me about your cocktail.

58:33.010 --> 58:36.010
It is a mint infused
simple syrup

58:36.010 --> 58:38.340
with bourbon and orange.

58:38.340 --> 58:39.240
Really yum!

58:39.250 --> 58:41.850
Very nice job on that.
Big steps forward.

58:41.850 --> 58:42.650
Thank you.

58:42.650 --> 58:44.250
Marti, come on up.

58:45.420 --> 58:47.020
[Marti] The orzo
has hot red pepper

58:47.020 --> 58:49.420
with onion and tomato
and garlic.

58:49.420 --> 58:51.120
[Anne] The flavor
of this is nice.

58:51.120 --> 58:53.320
Your fish is succulent,
it's really nicely cooked.

58:53.330 --> 58:54.260
Oh, cool.

58:54.260 --> 58:57.060
Your sauce looks lovely.
Great consistency.

58:57.060 --> 58:58.660
Talk to me about your mocktail.

58:58.660 --> 59:00.460
[Marti] So, I love grapefruit,

59:00.470 --> 59:02.800
I love mint
and I love ginger beer.

59:02.800 --> 59:05.870
Ginger and the grapefruit
are delicious together.

59:05.870 --> 59:08.010
But I'm missing
the herbaceousness.

59:08.010 --> 59:10.940
- Oh. Okay.
- But a very good effort.

59:10.940 --> 59:12.240
Yeah? [chuckles]

59:14.080 --> 59:16.250
- [whispers] You got this.
- Okay, good luck.

59:17.750 --> 59:19.780
Well done, recruits.

59:19.790 --> 59:22.420
This week in bootcamp
was smooth sailing

59:22.420 --> 59:23.350
for most of you.

59:23.360 --> 59:26.020
Let's start with the Blue team.

59:26.030 --> 59:28.690
There was one recruit whose
fish had me shell-shocked.

59:28.690 --> 59:31.090
[all giggle]

59:31.100 --> 59:34.300
The winner of the main dish
challenge on the Blue team this week is...

59:40.200 --> 59:41.710
Bianca.

59:41.710 --> 59:43.440
[all clapping]

59:44.580 --> 59:46.480
Oh, my God! [giggles]

59:46.480 --> 59:49.750
[Cliff] Your fish flavors
were ridiculously spot on.

59:49.750 --> 59:51.920
And since you had
the best dish of the bunch,

59:51.920 --> 59:54.150
you have won $1,000.

59:54.750 --> 59:56.020
[all cheering]

59:56.020 --> 59:57.320
Congrats, Bianca.

59:58.060 --> 1:00:00.090
You're gonna share
that $1,000 right?

1:00:00.090 --> 1:00:01.590
<i>[Bianca] Maybe.</i>

1:00:01.590 --> 1:00:03.060
May I send some bills your way?

1:00:03.060 --> 1:00:04.530
I'm gonna give
you like 50 bucks.

1:00:04.600 --> 1:00:05.860
And you're good.

1:00:05.860 --> 1:00:09.130
As for the rest of you, you
all have been given life jackets

1:00:09.130 --> 1:00:11.940
and can float into
the next week of bootcamp.

1:00:12.200 --> 1:00:13.200
Yay!

1:00:13.570 --> 1:00:16.910
[Anne] On the Red team,

1:00:16.910 --> 1:00:21.080
the dish whose fish
was certainly star quality

1:00:21.080 --> 1:00:23.050
belongs to...

1:00:25.180 --> 1:00:26.320
Marti.

1:00:27.050 --> 1:00:29.050
[all cheering]

1:00:30.920 --> 1:00:33.920
[mimics airhorns]

1:00:33.930 --> 1:00:39.030
I won a main dish challenge.

1:00:40.030 --> 1:00:43.900
Your dish was 100% complete.

1:00:43.900 --> 1:00:45.300
It was delicious.

1:00:45.870 --> 1:00:47.370
How do you feel?

1:00:47.770 --> 1:00:49.210
I feel great.

1:00:49.210 --> 1:00:51.910
Also safe this week
on the red team,

1:00:51.910 --> 1:00:52.780
Kara.

1:00:52.780 --> 1:00:54.850
[Angie] Yay, Kara.

1:00:54.850 --> 1:00:58.050
-Angie.
-[groans] Thank God. Thank you.

1:00:58.120 --> 1:00:59.950
Big Al.

1:00:59.950 --> 1:01:00.920
[all clapping]

1:01:00.920 --> 1:01:02.650
[sighs in relief]

1:01:02.660 --> 1:01:05.790
Unfortunately,
that means Hector,

1:01:05.790 --> 1:01:07.620
and Hilda,
you are in the bottom.

1:01:07.630 --> 1:01:08.590
Please step forward.

1:01:10.500 --> 1:01:13.830
Hector, we got you out
of first gear finally.

1:01:13.830 --> 1:01:16.870
And then you were like,
"All right, I got this."

1:01:16.870 --> 1:01:19.540
And it turns out,
for the main dish challenge,

1:01:19.540 --> 1:01:22.540
you didn't have
it quite so much.

1:01:22.540 --> 1:01:26.610
Hilda, yes, you technically
made different stuff than I did

1:01:26.610 --> 1:01:30.210
- but you know, squeaking by.
- [Hilda] Okay. Okay.

1:01:30.220 --> 1:01:32.780
All right? I feel like you have
way more in you than that.

1:01:32.790 --> 1:01:36.390
This was an incredibly
hard decision.

1:01:36.390 --> 1:01:40.860
Because I've seen really good
things from both of you.

1:01:40.860 --> 1:01:46.000
But the recruit that will
be leaving us today is...

1:01:51.070 --> 1:01:52.240
Hector.

1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:53.440
[sighs in relief]

1:01:54.810 --> 1:01:58.410
Unfortunately, I'm gonna have
to ask you for your apron.

1:01:58.410 --> 1:02:02.410
<i>[Hector] I'm leaving a
bootcamp with my head held high.</i>

1:02:02.410 --> 1:02:04.680
<i>You know, I think I can
get cooking at home</i>

1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:05.950
<i>with my own time.</i>

1:02:05.950 --> 1:02:07.850
And I think I can do that good

1:02:07.850 --> 1:02:10.790
now that I have the basics.

1:02:10.790 --> 1:02:11.860
[Anne] Now, you can tell
your mother-in-law

1:02:11.860 --> 1:02:13.890
that you can help
sometimes in the kitchen.

1:02:13.890 --> 1:02:15.830
-Definitely. Definitely.
-Right? And your wife. [laughs]

1:02:15.830 --> 1:02:16.590
[Hector] Thank you. Chef.

1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:18.200
[all clapping]

1:02:21.130 --> 1:02:23.670
Bianca, you just gotta
bring it everyday

1:02:23.670 --> 1:02:25.400
just like you have.

1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:27.740
Don't worry about the kids.
Don't worry about home.

1:02:27.740 --> 1:02:30.110
<i>You gotta bring home the bacon.</i>

1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:33.610
<i>[narrator] Next time on
Worst Cooks in America...</i>

1:02:33.610 --> 1:02:36.780
<i>[Anne] Today is all about
understanding flavor.</i>

1:02:36.780 --> 1:02:39.850
You know those flavors,
you know those ingredients.

1:02:39.850 --> 1:02:41.990
I've never stuck
my head in pasta.

1:02:41.990 --> 1:02:42.750
I've always wanted to.

1:02:42.760 --> 1:02:44.720
Oh, honey.

1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:47.090
<i>[Anne] We are going
to make a elegant dish</i>

1:02:47.090 --> 1:02:48.590
<i>sure to impress.</i>

1:02:48.590 --> 1:02:50.260
Yeah! Come on!

1:02:51.900 --> 1:02:53.760
You know that throbbing
sensation you get

1:02:53.770 --> 1:02:54.530
when you get a small burn?

1:02:54.530 --> 1:02:56.230
Oh, my God, it hurts.

1:02:56.240 --> 1:02:59.240
This is how my hand was
feeling times a thousand.

1:02:59.240 --> 1:03:00.240
I'm running out of time.
