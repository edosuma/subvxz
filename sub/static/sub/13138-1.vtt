00:34.159 --> 00:35.702
Dad, give me five dollars.

00:35.744 --> 00:38.413
Listen to me, young lady, I've had
just a battle I'm gonna take.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.707
Mom, what's he talking about?
Give me 5 dollars.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.668
Listen to your father
when he's talking to you.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.877
What's he talking about?

00:43.919 --> 00:45.587
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.256
Maria, you've been
thrown out of school.

00:47.297 --> 00:50.425
I was not thrown out. I quit.
Now give me 5 dollars.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.385
You little—

00:51.426 --> 00:52.886
John, stop it.
- You wouldn't dare.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.847
If I had my way—
- John, shut up!

00:54.888 --> 00:57.391
Well, what's gonna happen?
What's she gonna do with her life?

00:57.474 --> 00:58.767
I'm gonna get married.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.519
To who?
- To Anthony.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.436
Terrific.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.647
Maria, don't be silly,
Anthony's going to college.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.399
Only to play football.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.318
When he gets out, he'll be going to
work with his father doing construction

01:08.360 --> 01:10.904
...and be pullin' in
a really bitchin' salary...

01:12.197 --> 01:16.368
Don't smoke in the house.
- Besides, he's gonna marry me.

01:16.994 --> 01:18.662
I'm gonna have a baby.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.372
That's it!
- That's what?

01:20.414 --> 01:23.375
I will not have a goddamned tramp
living in my house!

01:23.417 --> 01:25.377
Mom, did you hear
what he called me?

01:25.919 --> 01:27.421
Bastard!
- Slut!

01:27.546 --> 01:29.923
Daddy!
- Get out!

01:39.766 --> 01:41.727
So there!

01:49.818 --> 01:52.070
John...

01:56.742 --> 02:00.245
Mom, I'm home.

02:01.914 --> 02:04.499
Mom?
- John?

02:04.791 --> 02:08.127
What happened?
- John!

02:13.467 --> 02:16.345
He's dead.

03:17.239 --> 03:19.867
Slaughter, what did I tell you
about smoking on the premises?

03:19.908 --> 03:20.909
Lay off, Ed.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.787
What's a PKE doing over here?
- Drop dead. Hand me those pliers.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.664
What's this?

03:26.707 --> 03:29.251
This is a lost cause, Ed.
- What is?

03:29.293 --> 03:31.378
This!
- You're gonna pay for that!

03:31.420 --> 03:33.255
This crap isn't worth
the time we put into it.

03:33.297 --> 03:34.798
What's wrong with it?
- It's cheap!

03:34.840 --> 03:36.550
So?
- Cheap!

03:36.592 --> 03:38.385
Well, can't you fix it?
- No!

03:38.427 --> 03:39.887
- Why not?

03:42.264 --> 03:43.724
Some things shouldn't be fixed.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.726
Well, you don't have a choice
in the matter, now, do you?

03:45.809 --> 03:48.353
The company employs you to
oversee the fabrication of these units...

03:48.395 --> 03:49.730
Ed!
- No, no, no, you listen to me!

03:49.771 --> 03:51.857
The company employs you
to oversee the fabri...

04:28.519 --> 04:30.771
Hi!
- What the fuck are you doing here?

04:30.812 --> 04:32.022
I got to tell you something.

04:32.064 --> 04:33.857
You get tossed out of school again?
- Yeah.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.859
What the hell did you do now?
- Come upstairs.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.152
No!
- Always up...

04:37.194 --> 04:39.905
Listen, Maria, this isn't the time
to be bugging me right now, OK?

04:39.947 --> 04:43.408
I got a game tonight and I've got
my college entrance exams tomorrow.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.661
This is important.
- Yeah, well, so is this!

04:45.702 --> 04:49.331
This is more important,
this is more important than football.

04:49.373 --> 04:53.460
Really?
- I mean I'll have a baby.

04:53.502 --> 04:56.380
What?
- A baby, stupid.

05:02.678 --> 05:07.140
Whose baby?
- Yours, you jerk!

05:19.403 --> 05:23.740
How could you be so stupid?
- Oh, thanks a lot.

05:23.824 --> 05:27.035
What are my parents gonna say?
I've got a scholarship on the line.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.329
What about me?
- Oh, what about you?

05:29.371 --> 05:30.747
How could you let this happen?

05:30.789 --> 05:33.250
- I didn't just let this happen
all by myself, you know.

05:33.292 --> 05:35.252
Oh, try to pin the blame on me?

05:35.294 --> 05:37.129
I'm not blaming you, it's just...

05:37.171 --> 05:39.131
You did this on purpose.
- I did not!

05:39.173 --> 05:41.049
You did this to keep me
from going away to college.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.342
Anthony!

05:44.720 --> 05:48.974
You said we'd get married.
- What?

05:49.057 --> 05:53.896
You did. You said we'd get married.
- Do you think I'd marry you now?

05:54.646 --> 06:00.444
Why would I marry you now?
High school drop-out, pregnant...

06:03.947 --> 06:09.620
You know, you squeeze that bread out and
you sit around watching TV all day long,

06:09.661 --> 06:12.873
and you know how you look like
by the time you're 21? Huh?

06:12.915 --> 06:15.209
Eew! You think I need that?
I don't need that!

06:15.250 --> 06:18.462
These are the most important years
of my life as a football player.

06:18.504 --> 06:21.006
This arm...
this arm is gonna make me famous.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.550
It's gonna take me
straight through college and into the NFL.

06:23.634 --> 06:27.346
And people say that I'm a smart player.
They say I'm good with strategy.

06:27.387 --> 06:31.266
That's why I practice so much.
That's why I've got to be devoted.

06:31.308 --> 06:34.603
I wake up every morning
at 6 o'clock and I run 3 miles.

06:34.645 --> 06:41.652
And I do 60 sit-ups and 80 push-ups, and
then I drink this mixture of 1 raw egg...

07:00.712 --> 07:04.675
Matthew?
Matthew, is that you?

07:05.008 --> 07:08.345
It's me.
-What?

07:17.688 --> 07:21.567
Why aren't you at work?

07:21.608 --> 07:25.237
Well, I...
- Speak up, for Christ's sakes!

07:26.113 --> 07:29.658
I quit.
- You what?

07:29.825 --> 07:31.743
I quit.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.621
You quit?
- I got fired.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.623
Well, which is it, Matthew,
you quit or you got fired?

07:36.665 --> 07:37.541
It's not that simple.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.877
Yes it is, you quit or you got fired.
Which one?

07:40.586 --> 07:42.171
I quit.

07:43.505 --> 07:48.093
You sure about that?
- Yes. I quit.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.565
You got a lot of fucking
nerve, you know that?

08:01.607 --> 08:04.276
You go through jobs
like most people go through underwear.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.195
I'll get another job.

08:06.236 --> 08:09.448
Expect me to support you your whole
goddamn life, is that it?    - No.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.409
What was that?
- I said no.

08:13.035 --> 08:15.704
When are you gonna wake up
and stand on your own two feet, huh?

08:15.746 --> 08:16.622
You're a grown man.

08:16.663 --> 08:20.334
When I was your age, I was on my own.
I was makin' a damn good livin'.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.669
I'll move out, then.

08:23.795 --> 08:29.134
What was that? Tell me what you said.
- You heard what I said.

08:29.176 --> 08:36.308
Tell me what you said, coward! Come on!
- I said "I'll move out, then".

08:46.068 --> 08:50.489
That's a joke! You would not know
how to take care of yourself.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.326
You're to thank God
I've been here to look after you.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.787
And when're you gonna clean
that bathroom like I ask, eh?

08:56.870 --> 09:00.541
But I did. I did it before I went to work.
- Hm, you call that clean?

09:01.375 --> 09:03.252
Yeah.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.046
Do it again.

09:12.636 --> 09:15.848
You eat yet?
- I'm not hungry.

09:18.642 --> 09:21.311
Fucking kid's gonna waste away.

09:47.004 --> 09:51.800
How many times I gotta tell you
to clean that goddamn bathroom?

09:51.842 --> 09:55.762
But I...
- Do it! Now!

10:24.583 --> 10:26.835
That would look great on you.

10:26.877 --> 10:29.254
I like this one, too.
- Try on both.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.007
Can I charge my parents' credit card?
- Sure.

10:32.049 --> 10:34.635
The dressing room is right over there.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.472
What's the problem?

11:20.514 --> 11:23.600
Oh, I wish I knew.
This damn car— it's always something.

11:23.809 --> 11:26.019
Sounds like the battery.

11:44.830 --> 11:49.501
Hey, Mr. Slaughter.
- Hi, Grace, Joey, how are you?

11:49.543 --> 11:50.419
Fine.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.296
That's nothing serious, Mrs. Black,

11:52.337 --> 11:54.965
just all the corrosion
here on your battery terminals.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.176
Joey, you wanna do
me a favor, please?

11:57.217 --> 12:00.304
Go in the garage and give me
a peace of sandpaper and a screwdriver, OK?

12:00.345 --> 12:02.431
OK.
- Grace...

12:08.979 --> 12:18.238
Save our children!
Close it down!

12:35.464 --> 12:39.551
What kind of questions do you have?
- I don't know.

12:40.385 --> 12:43.096
Do you want to have an abortion?
- I don't know.

12:43.138 --> 12:46.016
Do you have a boyfriend?
- No.

12:46.058 --> 12:51.772
Who is the father?
- There is no father.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.625
You?

13:12.417 --> 13:14.878
Sure.

13:40.195 --> 13:46.201
You know,
I'm looking at this guy, right?

13:46.410 --> 13:49.580
And I've looked at him a lot before.

13:49.746 --> 13:54.543
So now, I know that I have
this little piece of him actually in me.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.379
Physically in me, and it makes me feel...

13:57.421 --> 14:02.092
...completely different, I don't know,
sort of special or something.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.512
So I'm talking to him...

14:05.804 --> 14:11.476
I'm talking to him and I realize...
I'm...

14:12.895 --> 14:17.816
I'm talking to him and I realize
that he doesn't even see me.

14:18.233 --> 14:21.695
And I'm wondering
what it was he was seeing...

14:21.737 --> 14:26.283
...when we did this.
I go over it in my head...

14:26.700 --> 14:30.746
And now I know
what it was he was seeing.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.292
It's really simple.

14:36.835 --> 14:42.841
He's seeing my legs,
he's seeing my breasts...

14:43.342 --> 14:45.344
...my ass...

14:46.011 --> 14:48.180
...my mouth...

14:49.848 --> 14:53.936
...he's seeing my cunt.

15:00.067 --> 15:07.199
How could I've been so stupid?
It's really all there is to see, isn't it?

15:07.574 --> 15:09.618
That's not true.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.161
I don't know.

15:11.370 --> 15:14.831
That's not true.
And you know that.

15:16.542 --> 15:20.087
I don't know anything.

16:24.109 --> 16:27.529
Who the hell do you think you are?
- I don't think I'm anybody.

16:27.613 --> 16:29.489
You think
you're somebody special, don't you?

16:29.531 --> 16:30.908
Just tell me what I've done.

16:30.949 --> 16:33.202
You think you shit
ice cream cone, is that it?

16:33.243 --> 16:36.413
All I want to do is
clean the bathroom.

16:43.545 --> 16:47.174
I've seen your kind.
I've seen them all my life.

16:47.257 --> 16:50.302
You just keep taking, taking,
like everything was owe to you,

16:50.344 --> 16:52.763
like the rest of us
owed you something.

16:53.180 --> 16:56.225
You're like a little kid.
"Gimme this! Gimme that!"

16:56.266 --> 16:58.519
Other people need things,
too, you know, Matthew, huh?

16:58.560 --> 16:59.686
Do you ever think about that?

16:59.728 --> 17:02.731
Do you ever think about other people?
Do you ever think about me?

17:03.148 --> 17:06.734
I think about you all the time.
- What was that?

17:06.777 --> 17:08.362
Did you say something?

17:08.779 --> 17:11.698
I don't know what you want!

17:11.906 --> 17:15.327
I want a little cooperation.

17:24.627 --> 17:27.631
I don't know,
maybe it's my fault.

17:28.924 --> 17:33.679
It's not your fault.
- But then whose fault is it, huh?

17:34.054 --> 17:36.181
Whose fault is it, Matthew?

17:36.223 --> 17:40.227
If it isn't my fault,
whose fault is it?

17:41.353 --> 17:43.730
It's my fault.
- What was that?

17:43.772 --> 17:44.773
It's my fault.

17:44.815 --> 17:48.527
It's your fault.
- It's my fault!

17:51.238 --> 17:53.866
That's real big of you, Matthew.

17:55.534 --> 17:58.745
Do you think that changes anything?

18:02.416 --> 18:06.837
Mom? Anybody home?

18:10.465 --> 18:14.052
Aunt Faye, Uncle Leo,
what's going on, having a party?

18:14.094 --> 18:16.263
Hey, Peg,
you're having a party?

18:16.597 --> 18:21.685
[*]
Where's Mom?

18:26.398 --> 18:28.859
Mom?

18:35.365 --> 18:38.243
What happened?

18:40.829 --> 18:43.874
Where's Dad?

18:45.542 --> 18:48.378
He's dead.

18:48.921 --> 18:51.632
Dead?

18:52.132 --> 18:54.843
Dead.

18:56.887 --> 18:59.848
You killed him.

19:06.855 --> 19:11.109
Get out of my house.

19:24.748 --> 19:28.252
Hi, Carol. It's me, Maria.

19:28.836 --> 19:34.466
How do I know? I just...
I didn't... I didn't mean to...

19:34.967 --> 19:37.553
I don't know!

19:37.719 --> 19:40.889
Look, I don't have any place to go.

19:41.640 --> 19:47.062
What?
Because you're my best friend!

20:13.922 --> 20:20.429
Excuse me. Maybe it's none of
my business but... are you all right?

20:20.971 --> 20:27.019
I only ask because you seem a little pale.
Are you hungry?

20:27.227 --> 20:31.523
Has something happened
or you're hurt?

20:35.569 --> 20:40.449
Now, now... Everything will be
all right, everything will be OK.

20:40.866 --> 20:44.536
It's just a stupid thing to say,
really stupid...

20:44.578 --> 20:46.788
How the hell do you know?

20:46.997 --> 20:50.250
I'm sorry,
it just seemed like the thing to say.

20:50.501 --> 20:53.921
Why say anything?
- I don't know.

20:54.546 --> 20:58.383
There's nothing to say.
- Maybe.

20:58.884 --> 21:01.220
Give me five dollars.

21:11.605 --> 21:17.277
I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Go ahead, take it.

21:17.819 --> 21:21.073
I want you to have it.

21:27.412 --> 21:29.790
I killed my father this morning.

21:29.831 --> 21:33.043
My daughter would've been
just about your age.

21:33.085 --> 21:36.630
I didn't mean to, honest...
It was an accident; we were just arguing.

21:37.214 --> 21:40.050
I spent some time in a
psychiatric hospital.

21:40.092 --> 21:42.886
I didn't even know
he had a bad heart.

21:42.928 --> 21:45.722
After that my husband
just didn't want children.

21:45.764 --> 21:48.225
He always seemed healthy enough.

21:48.267 --> 21:51.436
Wonder if deep down
he blames me for her death.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.564
I just slapped him.

21:57.901 --> 22:01.446
I hate my husband.
- You just never know...

22:01.488 --> 22:03.532
He's just like a child himself.

22:03.574 --> 22:08.203
How can a slap on the face kill a man?
- He's so absurdly like a little boy.

22:08.662 --> 22:13.750
Every summer we have to go to this
ridiculous resort called Cape Holiday.

22:13.876 --> 22:15.085
What?

22:15.127 --> 22:18.714
I hate Cape Holiday.
- I'm sorry.

22:19.131 --> 22:24.887
The days are like clockwork.
The same routine year in and year out.

22:25.512 --> 22:30.058
Him off to the city every morning,
with his briefcase and his pipe.

22:30.142 --> 22:34.438
And back again each evening
on the 17:15 train.

22:35.314 --> 22:38.734
Me at home, dusting a house
that never gets dirty...

22:38.775 --> 22:40.819
...never gets messed up.

22:41.445 --> 22:44.656
There's no one there to mess it up.

22:45.782 --> 22:47.242
Sometimes I come home...

22:47.284 --> 22:50.454
...and I find myself hoping
that the house is a wreck...

22:50.871 --> 22:54.458
...filthy. Complete disarray.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.627
Sometimes I come home...

22:56.668 --> 23:01.632
...and I find myself hoping that
the house has been destroyed by fire.

23:08.180 --> 23:11.808
Well, thanks for the 5 dollars.

23:23.362 --> 23:27.574
I don't care about any of that!
What am I supposed to pay the rent with?

23:28.116 --> 23:29.868
Are you still sleeping with that slut?

23:29.910 --> 23:33.497
Yeah, will you tell her I'm gonna rip
her lungs out the next time I see her!

23:33.580 --> 23:35.249
<i>Oh, what?</i>

23:36.917 --> 23:39.419
Let me see some proof.
- What?

23:39.461 --> 23:42.923
Come on!
- I buy beer here all the time.

23:42.965 --> 23:46.343
Not from me, adult.
- Oh, where's that other guy, that lady?

23:46.426 --> 23:48.387
Look, they're not working right now.
I am.

23:48.428 --> 23:51.849
You wanna buy beer now,
you gotta show me proof.

23:58.480 --> 24:04.361
Look, mister, I've had a really bad day.
Just take the money. Please?

24:20.460 --> 24:24.006
Come back here a minute.

24:24.548 --> 24:26.300
Come on, you want the beer?

24:26.341 --> 24:29.845
Yeah, I want the beer.
Why do I have to go back there?

24:30.345 --> 24:33.891
I don't want you going at the front,
somebody might see you.

24:33.932 --> 24:36.768
They could close me down
for selling you beer.

24:54.703 --> 24:57.497
There is no back door here.
- Come on, give me a kiss.

24:57.539 --> 25:00.167
Oh, gross!
- Hey, you want the beer, you gotta give me a kiss.

25:00.209 --> 25:02.252
Okay, just give me back the money.
- No way!

25:02.294 --> 25:03.295
Come on, it's not fair.

25:03.337 --> 25:06.173
Well, you think it's fair you coming
in here jeopardizing my business?

25:06.215 --> 25:08.383
Ain't jeopardizing anything,
I wanna do business.

25:08.425 --> 25:09.885
Right, so give me a kiss.

25:09.927 --> 25:12.137
Ah, let me out of here.
You can keep the money.

25:12.221 --> 25:14.056
Hey, I don't want the money.
I want the kiss.

25:14.097 --> 25:15.557
You can't have both.

25:16.099 --> 25:20.270
All right. Here's the 5 dollars,
Now give me a kiss. On the lips.

25:20.312 --> 25:21.855
Drop dead!

25:22.022 --> 25:23.732
You have to. I gave you
back the 5 dollars.

25:23.774 --> 25:24.566
It's mine to begin with!

25:24.608 --> 25:28.195
Listen, do you want the beer or not?
- If you don't let me go I'm gonna scream.

25:28.237 --> 25:30.113
Go ahead!
My brother's chief of police.

25:30.155 --> 25:33.075
I'll say you were stealing.
They're gonna believe me, not you.

25:33.242 --> 25:36.119
Come on!
- Just a little kiss.

25:37.371 --> 25:42.084
Listen, I'm not gonna kiss you, face it!
- Look I don't have to be nice about this.

25:42.125 --> 25:45.170
I want that you just make it easy on yourself.

25:46.713 --> 25:47.673
Give me a cigarette.

25:47.714 --> 25:50.592
Hmm, if I give you a cigarette,
you have to take off your shirt.

25:50.634 --> 25:52.135
You're really disgusting.

25:52.177 --> 25:56.765
Just business, honey, free trade.
- Shut up and give me a cigarette.

26:03.438 --> 26:06.441
Now take off your shirt.
- Just wait a minute, will ya?

26:07.818 --> 26:12.281
Let me see you touch yourself.
- I bet that gets you really excited, huh?

26:12.322 --> 26:13.991
Sure does. How about you?

26:23.083 --> 26:25.711
They stole my baby!

26:28.755 --> 26:31.550
Fuck!

28:12.067 --> 28:14.736
What do you want?

28:18.740 --> 28:20.701
I don't want anything.

28:20.742 --> 28:23.453
Really?
- Yeah.

28:25.330 --> 28:26.790
Why?

28:26.832 --> 28:28.959
Because I don't think
anything's gonna help.

28:29.251 --> 28:34.548
What do you mean by that?
- Did you drink all that beer by yourself?

28:36.258 --> 28:40.053
Do you live around here?
- Not far.

28:40.554 --> 28:45.726
I don't have anywhere to go.
- So?

28:46.185 --> 28:48.061
Forget it.

28:51.273 --> 28:56.612
So what do you want?
- I said I didn't want anything.

28:56.653 --> 29:00.157
Then get lost!
- What do you want?

29:00.324 --> 29:03.076
I don't want anything from you,
that's for sure.

29:03.118 --> 29:05.621
Really?
- Yeah, really.

29:23.472 --> 29:26.016
Say it.

29:33.232 --> 29:35.317
I...

29:41.865 --> 29:45.410
I need some place to sleep.

30:47.764 --> 30:50.767
What are these?

30:50.976 --> 30:53.604
Make your stomach feel better.

30:58.525 --> 31:01.236
Where are you from?
- Around.

31:01.278 --> 31:03.155
Have you run away or something?

31:03.238 --> 31:06.158
I'm a murderer.
- Really? Who'd you kill?

31:06.491 --> 31:10.370
I'm not actually a murderer,
but I thought about killing myself.

31:10.954 --> 31:14.917
I know what you mean.
- You do?

31:15.375 --> 31:18.504
I carry this with me at all times.
- A hand grenade?

31:18.545 --> 31:20.797
Yeah.
- Is it real?

31:20.839 --> 31:23.967
My dad brought it back from Korea.
- What for?

31:24.009 --> 31:25.469
Souvenir, I would guess.

31:25.552 --> 31:28.430
No, I mean why do you carry
it about you all the time?

31:28.472 --> 31:30.891
Just in case.
- Just in case what?

31:30.933 --> 31:33.018
Just in case.

31:33.060 --> 31:35.646
Are you emotionally disturbed?

31:36.063 --> 31:40.025
Look, I just showed it to you
because of what you said.

31:40.108 --> 31:42.861
Forget what I said,
put it away.

31:45.822 --> 31:49.576
Do you think it's good idea
to drink soda for breakfast?

31:50.327 --> 31:52.037
Keeps my skin clear.

31:52.079 --> 31:54.665
What?
- It's true.

31:54.748 --> 31:57.543
In ten years your bones are
gonna snap like twigs.

31:57.584 --> 31:58.961
Gotta have a glass of milk.

31:59.002 --> 32:00.128
Milk gives me pimples.

32:00.170 --> 32:03.632
You'll probably get more pimples
from all the makeup you're wearing.

32:03.674 --> 32:07.135
Makeup hides my pimples.
- Sorry.

32:07.636 --> 32:10.931
You live here alone?
- With my Dad.

32:11.014 --> 32:14.184
Where's he?
- Visiting his sister.

32:19.064 --> 32:22.150
Well, I gotta go
see this jerk about a job.

32:22.985 --> 32:26.113
Can I take a shower?
- Sure.

32:26.738 --> 32:28.657
Thanks.

32:29.199 --> 32:31.076
It's OK.

32:48.802 --> 32:50.596
So what's wrong with it?

32:50.637 --> 32:55.767
- Listen, cookie-puss, your warranty's
expired. So just shut up and blow!

32:56.852 --> 33:00.314
What do you want?
- I'm here to see Mr. Santiago.

33:00.355 --> 33:02.858
He ain't in.
- Get him.

33:02.900 --> 33:04.276
What do you want?

33:04.318 --> 33:09.448
What is it, Bruce?
- Nothing. Nothing much at all.

33:11.533 --> 33:14.912
So, Matthew, your father tells me
you need a job.

33:14.995 --> 33:16.455
He tells me you need help.

33:16.496 --> 33:19.625
Don't start it with me, Matthew,
I'm only doing this for your father.

33:20.042 --> 33:24.046
I don't do TVs.
- But TVs is what we fix.

33:24.463 --> 33:28.509
Television is the opium of the masses.
- Matthew, be reasonable...

33:29.051 --> 33:31.637
I know you need a job.
You know you need a job.

33:31.678 --> 33:35.098
It may not be what you're used to,
but a paycheck's a paycheck.

33:37.351 --> 33:41.605
Radios. I'll do radios...
phone answering machines, calculators.

33:41.647 --> 33:43.732
I don't need help with that stuff.
Look...

33:43.774 --> 33:47.319
300 a week, I'll give you all the
radios and appliances you want, but...

33:47.361 --> 33:48.695
you got to work on TVs.

33:48.737 --> 33:50.948
200 a week,
and I only do radios and appliances.

33:51.156 --> 33:54.076
But I need help with the TVs!

33:57.621 --> 33:59.164
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

33:59.206 --> 34:02.626
Jesus Christ, I'm just trying
to do your old man a favor.

34:02.835 --> 34:05.337
I'm sure he appreciates it.

34:14.471 --> 34:17.766
It was busted anyway.

35:01.226 --> 35:05.731
<i>Infant kidnapped at bus stop.</i>

36:31.441 --> 36:32.901
Hi!

36:33.527 --> 36:36.947
Who the hell are you?
- I'm a friend of your son's.

36:36.989 --> 36:39.867
My son doesn't have any friends.

36:57.634 --> 37:00.304
What the hell's
goin' on around here?

37:00.345 --> 37:01.388
Answer me!
- Hey!

37:01.430 --> 37:03.974
You keep out of this!
Answer me, Matthew!

37:04.016 --> 37:05.601
Why don't you just leave him alone?

37:05.642 --> 37:07.603
Listen, missy, you just better
put your clothes back on...

37:07.644 --> 37:09.313
and get the hell out of my house.

37:09.354 --> 37:11.190
I'll need all my
clothes in the dryer,

37:11.231 --> 37:14.193
and I'm gonna wait till they're dry,
and then I'll leave.

37:14.693 --> 37:16.904
Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right!

37:16.945 --> 37:20.073
Well, I got news
for you, you little harlot.

37:21.325 --> 37:24.661
Hey, you all right?

37:25.204 --> 37:28.749
Matthew, where're you going?
Matthew, get back here!

37:29.208 --> 37:33.128
You better be gone when I get back.

37:59.446 --> 38:02.616
<i>Man and the Universe
Ned Rifle</i>

38:39.069 --> 38:42.573
I hate Van Gogh.

38:47.494 --> 38:52.165
Matthew, really s-sorry.
Look, I'm turning it off.

38:52.499 --> 38:55.586
Play it and shut up.
Bring me a bottle of Scotch.

38:56.211 --> 38:57.796
What the hell are you looking at?

38:57.838 --> 39:00.799
Here you go, Matthew. It's on the house.
- Shut up!

39:13.562 --> 39:16.773
How did you know what I was drinking?
- Get lost.

39:17.065 --> 39:19.651
Your friend, the bartender
warned me about you.

39:19.693 --> 39:20.986
I don't have any friends.

39:21.028 --> 39:23.155
Aha, he says that women
aren't very safe in here.

39:23.280 --> 39:23.906
Is that so?

39:23.947 --> 39:26.408
I know some people who think
that you ought to be locked up!

39:26.450 --> 39:29.578
You gonna drink, or you gonna talk?
- Damn, you really are fucked up.

39:29.620 --> 39:30.537
And you are not?

39:30.579 --> 39:32.748
Well, at least I'm a grown-up.

39:32.956 --> 39:35.792
Listen, I don't wanna
discuss your problems.

39:35.834 --> 39:38.295
OK, let's discuss yours.
- Why are you dressed in black?

39:38.337 --> 39:39.671
Is that a problem for you?

39:39.713 --> 39:43.342
No, I just think if a woman comes into
a bar like this, dressed in black...

39:43.383 --> 39:46.220
may not be the kind of woman
who likes to talk much.

39:46.553 --> 39:48.680
Oh, but I love to talk.

39:51.934 --> 39:54.728
OK. What do you want to talk about?

39:54.770 --> 39:57.564
Oh, I don't know... Nothing
in particular... The weather, maybe?

39:57.606 --> 39:58.398
The weather sucks.

39:58.440 --> 40:00.692
I think it's kind of warm
for this time of the year, don't you think?

40:00.734 --> 40:02.653
Damage to the ozone.
- What is that?

40:02.694 --> 40:04.530
Ozone.
- What is that?

40:05.155 --> 40:08.116
Keeps the Sun's ultraviolet rays
from burning us up.

40:08.158 --> 40:10.160
Where the hell have you
been the last 10 years?

40:10.369 --> 40:11.954
Married.

40:11.995 --> 40:13.997
I don't think
this conversation is going anywhere.

40:14.039 --> 40:16.834
Well, sure it is. I am learning
all this great stuff about the ozone.

40:16.875 --> 40:17.835
Great!

40:19.545 --> 40:25.342
So, do you have a girlfriend?
- What's that got to do with anything?

40:25.634 --> 40:27.177
Maybe that's your problem.

40:27.219 --> 40:29.221
I have a problem?
- Of course you do!

40:29.263 --> 40:32.724
Oh, and what do you think that is?
- I— I think you don't get laid enough.

40:32.766 --> 40:33.767
Is that so?

40:33.809 --> 40:37.354
What kind of a relationship could a guy
as screwed up as you possibly have?

40:37.396 --> 40:40.065
I don't have relationships.
- So you just love'em and leave'em?

40:40.107 --> 40:42.818
I don't love anybody.
- So you just have a girl?

40:42.860 --> 40:44.194
I take what I can get.

40:44.236 --> 40:47.573
Now, if you're through talking,
do you wanna go out back and fuck?

40:51.618 --> 40:54.037
Baby, you're talking
to the mother of two.

40:54.079 --> 40:58.375
You know that? You can't be talking to
somebody's mother like that. Bastard!

40:58.417 --> 40:59.793
Here, have a drink with me.

40:59.835 --> 41:02.504
Oh, fuck off!
- No, seriously. I mean it. Stay.

41:08.760 --> 41:11.263
And I think it's been very
screwed up since my divorce.

41:11.305 --> 41:14.183
They took the kids away from me
like I'm unfit or something...

41:14.266 --> 41:14.975
Do you get a car?

41:15.017 --> 41:17.352
Here you are? I've been
looking all over for you.

41:17.394 --> 41:19.146
Maria?
- Peg?

41:19.229 --> 41:21.273
Where did you get that dress?
- Do you know him?

41:21.315 --> 41:22.441
Matthew, come home with us.

41:22.482 --> 41:24.026
What?
- He has to, Peg.

41:24.067 --> 41:25.444
Maria, if you come home right now,

41:25.485 --> 41:28.071
mom is gonna stab you
in the heart with a steak knife, OK?

41:28.113 --> 41:31.033
You two are sisters?
- Don't go back to your father's house.

41:31.074 --> 41:32.951
I have to go back.
- Why?   - I have to.

41:32.993 --> 41:35.370
Matthew, he's a monster.
- What is going on here?

41:35.412 --> 41:37.581
Matthew is coming home
to live with us for a while.

41:37.623 --> 41:40.501
Maria, do you know who this guy is?
- I don't care who he is.

41:40.542 --> 41:41.793
Who are you?

41:41.835 --> 41:43.545
Maybe he doesn't want
to come home with us.

41:43.587 --> 41:45.672
Leave me alone.
- There! OK?

41:45.881 --> 41:48.175
Maria, come on, let's
get out of here.

41:48.217 --> 41:49.843
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

41:49.885 --> 41:51.345
Maria, come on.

41:51.386 --> 41:53.931
Please come home with me.
- Why?

41:53.972 --> 41:55.807
I'm afraid of my mother.

42:33.428 --> 42:36.265
Oh, Jesus Christ!

42:36.682 --> 42:40.853
I'm never gonna forgive you.
- I know.

42:41.395 --> 42:44.731
As long as I live,
I'm gonna work your fingers to the bone.

42:44.940 --> 42:46.191
OK.

42:48.694 --> 42:51.446
Did you eat anything today?
- No.

42:51.655 --> 42:54.867
Sit down,
I'll fix you something.

42:59.746 --> 43:02.624
Who's your friend?

43:03.292 --> 43:07.379
So, then he gives me back the five dollars,
and he still wants me to kiss him.

43:07.421 --> 43:08.922
Gross!
- Disgusting!

43:08.964 --> 43:12.551
I was so scared. He's like sweating and
rubbing his crotch and everything.

43:12.593 --> 43:14.469
So what did you do?
- What do you think I did?

43:14.511 --> 43:17.055
You burned him with a cigarette.
- Right in the eye.

43:17.097 --> 43:19.266
Ouch!
- That man is going straight to hell.

43:19.308 --> 43:21.226
And he's threatening
he'd call the cops on me.

43:21.268 --> 43:23.437
So was this before or after
the baby disappeared?

43:23.478 --> 43:26.064
Just before it.
- You've got to go to the police, Maria.

43:26.106 --> 43:27.649
Yes, that man should be punished.

43:27.691 --> 43:28.901
You know, that the baby...

43:28.942 --> 43:31.653
Well, I don't know, I can't be sure.
I didn't see anything.

43:31.778 --> 43:35.365
Well, maybe they can talk to her.
- She seemed so sad, so mixed up.

43:35.407 --> 43:38.243
We're all mixed up, Maria.
We don't go around stealing babies.

43:38.285 --> 43:40.412
You see, you're already
convinced that she did it.

43:40.454 --> 43:42.623
So what are you gonna do?
- About what?

43:42.664 --> 43:45.042
About being pregnant.
-You ain't the father, are you?

43:45.083 --> 43:46.710
No, ma'am.
- Mom!

43:46.752 --> 43:48.378
Eat your sandwich.

43:48.420 --> 43:51.423
I went to the clinic yesterday,
and I spoke to this lady.

43:51.465 --> 43:54.176
How much?
- I need about 250 bucks.

43:54.218 --> 43:55.552
What? For an abortion?

43:55.594 --> 43:59.223
Don't look at me! I spent everything
we had on your father's casket.

43:59.264 --> 44:01.642
The divorce lawyers took all my money.

44:01.683 --> 44:02.935
I'll get a job.

44:02.976 --> 44:04.436
I've got money.
- No, thank you.

44:04.478 --> 44:07.022
It's OK.
- Why don't you get it from Anthony?

44:07.064 --> 44:08.815
I never want to see
that jerk again.

44:08.857 --> 44:11.902
Take the money from me.
- No... You don't have a job, either.

44:11.944 --> 44:17.658
I'm gonna take this job fixing TVs.
- Maria, where did you get that dress?

44:19.284 --> 44:21.870
Belonged to my mother.

44:50.315 --> 44:52.693
Fixed it?
- Yeah.

44:52.776 --> 44:55.737
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

44:58.574 --> 45:01.076
Do you want some TV?
- I don't watch TV.

45:01.118 --> 45:02.661
Why not?
- It gives you cancer.

45:02.703 --> 45:05.539
It does not!
- Well, see for yourself.

45:05.747 --> 45:08.667
Do you know
what the word "empirical" means?

45:08.709 --> 45:10.794
Don't ask him,
he thinks TV gives you cancer.

45:10.878 --> 45:15.591
Means... information
based on experience.

45:18.719 --> 45:23.182
You can't know something
unless you experience it first.

45:26.977 --> 45:31.565
I borrowed it. Do you mind?
- No.

45:31.648 --> 45:34.193
I put a bed in here for you.

45:36.862 --> 45:40.240
Where do you sleep?
- I sleep in there.

45:44.536 --> 45:49.041
There's no bed in here.
- I don't need a bed.

45:51.376 --> 45:55.339
Are you nearsighted?
- Yeah.

45:55.422 --> 46:01.470
Why don't you wear your glasses?
- They make me look stupid.

46:01.512 --> 46:05.891
How do you mean?
- You know, brainy, like a librarian.

46:06.433 --> 46:09.102
I like librarians.

46:36.255 --> 46:40.759
Give me your hand grenade.
- Why?

46:40.801 --> 46:43.387
Give it to me.

46:51.854 --> 46:54.147
Maria!

46:59.695 --> 47:03.073
I don't want you getting any ideas.

47:03.198 --> 47:05.242
Ideas about what?

47:05.409 --> 47:10.664
You know what. Tomorrow you find
some place else to sleep. Got it?

47:10.706 --> 47:11.832
OK.

47:11.874 --> 47:15.961
I don't know what your problem is,
but I got problems of my own.

47:29.433 --> 47:31.602
<i>I am ashamed.</i>

47:33.353 --> 47:44.865
<i>I am ashamed of being young.</i>

47:45.699 --> 47:58.962
<i>I am ashamed of being stupid.</i>

48:28.534 --> 48:32.454
So have you been over to the clinic?
- Yes.

48:32.788 --> 48:35.624
You gonna have an abortion?
- Suppose.

48:35.916 --> 48:39.920
I think that's the right move.
- Did you ever have one?

48:39.962 --> 48:41.588
An abortion?
- Yeah.

48:41.630 --> 48:43.257
Sure.
- When?

48:43.298 --> 48:44.716
A couple of years ago.

48:44.758 --> 48:47.052
After you'd already had children?
- Exactly.

48:47.094 --> 48:47.803
Why?

48:47.845 --> 48:51.557
Because I already had two kids I couldn't
handle, and I hated my husband.

48:51.640 --> 48:55.644
My second baby saved my marriage...
- No, my marriage is beyond saving.

48:55.769 --> 48:58.146
Did you have the baby
because your marriage needed help?

48:58.188 --> 49:03.360
Definitely... And I really liked to have
another baby. I like being pregnant.

49:03.402 --> 49:05.946
Did you want to
get pregnant the first time?

49:05.988 --> 49:08.574
I suppose. I mean
I didn't think about it.

49:09.032 --> 49:12.327
When we first got married, we'd
just spend the whole time fucking.

49:12.369 --> 49:14.955
What the hell,
we're married, right? So...

49:15.455 --> 49:17.291
And pretty soon I got pregnant.
That was OK...

49:17.332 --> 49:20.335
...except I was already
kind of bored of my husband.

49:20.919 --> 49:22.546
I was 17.

49:22.588 --> 49:25.424
How old were you when you got married?
- 20.

49:25.465 --> 49:29.052
Did you want to have kids right away?
- Oh, yeah, I couldn't wait.

49:29.219 --> 49:32.139
Did you ever think about
what you life might've been like...

49:32.181 --> 49:35.100
...if you never got
married and had kids?

49:35.434 --> 49:38.520
No.
- Never?

49:38.562 --> 49:42.274
What's the point of
thinking about that now?

49:42.316 --> 49:47.696
Well, did you think about it then?
- Of course not. Did you, Peg?

49:49.823 --> 49:53.619
Who thinks about that
when you're 17 years old?

49:54.786 --> 49:57.831
OK, you stand here like this,
you take one of the slugs

49:57.873 --> 49:59.750
...and put it right in there
where the groove is.

49:59.791 --> 50:02.711
Put your foot on the pedal down here so,
like this, and then you press down.

50:02.753 --> 50:04.630
You take the arm,
you bring it down slowly

50:04.671 --> 50:06.924
...until the drill goes
all the way through to the mark.

50:06.965 --> 50:08.217
You got that?
- Right.

50:08.258 --> 50:11.762
OK, then you take the arm, you let it go,
you take your foot off the pedal.

50:11.803 --> 50:13.764
You gotta let go of the arm first.
Remember that!

50:13.805 --> 50:14.765
Let go of the arm first.

50:14.806 --> 50:17.351
Let go of the arm first,
or you break the entire the machine.

50:17.392 --> 50:19.144
As soon as you take
your foot off the pedal,

50:19.186 --> 50:22.731
...you slide the slug off
the plating to the barrel like that.

51:10.362 --> 51:12.447
Hi!
- How was work?

51:12.489 --> 51:15.659
Do you know how to type?
- Not very good at it.

51:15.701 --> 51:17.160
I gotta learn how to type.

51:17.202 --> 51:22.040
Typing's gotta be a lot better than drilling
little holes in pieces of aluminum all day.

51:22.207 --> 51:26.003
What time is it?
- 17:05.

51:33.427 --> 51:36.096
Who are we waiting for?

51:36.138 --> 51:39.766
The husband of the lady
I met on the bench.

51:40.392 --> 51:42.227
How do you know what he looks like?

51:42.269 --> 51:46.315
I remember her saying
he carries a briefcase and smokes a pipe.

51:46.940 --> 51:49.234
A lot of men fit that description.

51:49.276 --> 51:51.653
Yeah, but I think we'll
know his kind when we see him.

51:51.695 --> 51:56.658
Why?
- He seem childish... like a boy.

51:57.826 --> 52:00.913
Kind of nave.
- Kind of what?

52:01.413 --> 52:06.293
<i>Nave.</i>
- Nave?

52:11.340 --> 52:15.052
Naïve.
- Naïve.

52:15.093 --> 52:17.095
Naïve.

52:37.407 --> 52:40.369
Still here, huh?
- Mom, he has nowhere to go.

52:40.410 --> 52:42.454
Shut up, you!
Finish those potatoes!

52:42.496 --> 52:44.748
Mom, if I eat anything else,
I'll explode.

52:44.790 --> 52:48.502
Eat them. And when you finish,
get started on the dishes.

52:48.794 --> 52:51.213
This is a well built piece of machinery.

52:51.255 --> 52:52.965
They don't make things like they used to.

52:53.006 --> 52:54.883
Mom, you never told us
you were a secretary.

52:54.925 --> 52:56.718
I hated it.
I hated working.

52:56.760 --> 52:58.804
I was so glad
when your father proposed.

52:58.846 --> 53:00.931
Don't you consider
being a wife and mother work?

53:00.973 --> 53:03.350
With the likes of
you two it was torture.

53:03.392 --> 53:05.352
Do you ever think of
going back out to work?

53:05.394 --> 53:07.396
Never!
<i>You are going to support me.</i>

53:07.521 --> 53:09.648
The rest of my life you'll
have to make sure

53:09.690 --> 53:12.025
there's food in my mouth
and clothes on my back.

53:12.109 --> 53:15.362
Got it? Now finish those potatoes.
- Okay, okay.

53:15.404 --> 53:18.031
It's not gonna be easy.
- I know.

53:18.073 --> 53:19.908
You'll have to work
every minute of your life.

53:19.950 --> 53:22.202
Mom, ease up.
Maybe you lie down.

53:22.244 --> 53:25.163
Peg, don't play up to me.

53:25.497 --> 53:28.542
OK, I think that's it.

53:32.838 --> 53:36.925
I didn't want any daughters
in the first place.

53:39.219 --> 53:44.558
You'll have to type faster than that,
to keep us out of poorhouse.

54:02.492 --> 54:05.495
Good night, Mom.

54:18.675 --> 54:22.554
Do you miss your kids?
- Sure.

54:23.055 --> 54:25.891
Do you hate your husband?
- Absolutely.

54:25.974 --> 54:30.354
Would you ever get married again?
- Of course.

54:35.692 --> 54:39.112
Why aren't you asleep?
- I don't sleep.

54:39.363 --> 54:43.242
Aren't you a little old to be
running around with a 17-year-old?

54:43.408 --> 54:45.869
You want me to go?
- I don't know.

54:45.911 --> 54:48.997
I'm not here to cause trouble.
- There's no avoiding trouble.

54:50.123 --> 54:51.583
You ride Maria pretty hard.

54:51.625 --> 54:54.336
How I raise my kids
is none of your business.

54:54.378 --> 54:56.129
Sorry.

54:56.296 --> 55:00.926
You like her more than Peg, don't you?
- Who said anything about Peg?

55:00.968 --> 55:02.386
I think Peg's prettier.

55:02.427 --> 55:05.222
They're both pretty.
- Peg's more level-headed, too.

55:05.264 --> 55:08.016
She's wild—always has been—,
made a mess of a marriage.

55:08.308 --> 55:09.977
Maria sleeps on the floor.

55:10.018 --> 55:13.313
You really do like her more, huh?
- I don't like to see her torture herself.

55:13.355 --> 55:15.649
Have you two been screwing around?

55:19.570 --> 55:20.946
Want a cigarette?

55:20.988 --> 55:24.032
Don't change the subject.
- I haven't touched her.

55:24.241 --> 55:26.702
I don't think she knows much
about how to make love to a man.

55:26.743 --> 55:28.996
She must know something.
She's pregnant.

55:29.037 --> 55:30.080
That's what I mean.

55:30.122 --> 55:33.292
A girl who knows hot to make love
to a man would never let that happen.

55:33.333 --> 55:34.334
You think so?

55:34.376 --> 55:40.549
You stand a better chance with Peg,
you know? And I bet she's great in bed.

55:44.094 --> 55:47.806
We don't have much in common.

55:51.268 --> 55:54.938
When was the last time
you were with a woman?

55:55.898 --> 55:58.567
I don't remember.

56:03.947 --> 56:06.742
I'm never gonna let you
take Maria away from me.

56:06.783 --> 56:09.119
I never said I wanted to.
- She's gotta pay.

56:09.161 --> 56:10.746
Your husband died of a heart attack.

56:10.787 --> 56:14.082
No one dies of a heart attack.
They die of disgust... disappointment.

56:14.458 --> 56:17.002
You're not the first woman in the world
who's had a hard time.

56:17.044 --> 56:19.630
You're an outsider,
you don't understand.

56:19.671 --> 56:24.593
A family's gotta stick together,
come hell or high water.

56:29.723 --> 56:31.183
Family's like a gun.

56:31.225 --> 56:34.978
You point it in the wrong direction,
you're gonna kill somebody.

56:35.020 --> 56:37.147
Exactly.

56:44.530 --> 56:47.950
You gotta leave this house.
- I have to take care of my mother.

56:47.991 --> 56:52.204
Your mother is a psychopath.
- She's just in pain.

56:53.080 --> 56:55.040
What are you doing in here?

56:55.082 --> 56:56.708
How does this work?

56:56.750 --> 56:59.336
What do you want to know that for?
Give me that thing.

56:59.545 --> 57:01.338
No. How's it work?

57:01.380 --> 57:05.008
Why?
- I just wanna know.

57:15.143 --> 57:18.105
See this pin?

57:18.230 --> 57:23.610
You pull that, wait 8 seconds, and...
- Boom.

57:24.194 --> 57:26.321
Sleep in here tonight.

57:26.363 --> 57:30.534
I don't mean with me,
I just mean sleep here...

57:30.576 --> 57:35.664
...in a bed.
- Peg says you have a reputation.

57:35.706 --> 57:39.459
What kind of reputation?
- Dangerous reputation.

57:39.960 --> 57:42.504
Peg's got a reputation herself.

57:42.546 --> 57:45.883
I want to become a nun.
- No, you don't.

57:45.924 --> 57:48.385
Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

57:48.427 --> 57:52.764
You're just having
some kind of severe reaction.

57:53.098 --> 57:56.059
I don't wanna feel anything.

57:56.185 --> 57:59.396
Well, I bet nuns feel things.

58:00.022 --> 58:06.486
You have to be dead not to feel things.
You don't wanna be dead, do you?

58:24.505 --> 58:28.383
I'm gonna go to the clinic
tomorrow to have the abortion.

58:28.425 --> 58:30.344
Will you come with me?

58:35.015 --> 58:37.142
If you want me to.

58:37.476 --> 58:40.437
Why do you do this?
- Do what?

58:40.479 --> 58:42.773
Why do you hang around here
and look after me like this?

58:42.814 --> 58:44.566
Somebody has to.

58:44.900 --> 58:47.569
Why you?

58:51.073 --> 58:54.493
How long do you think it'll take?
- I don't know, not long, I guess.

58:54.535 --> 58:56.578
Are you OK?
- Yeah. You?

58:56.620 --> 58:57.829
Feel like smashing things up.

58:57.871 --> 59:00.832
Relax. There's nothing to worry about.
Why don't you go for a walk?

59:00.874 --> 59:01.959
I don't wanna take a walk.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.210
You sure you wanna
go through with this?

59:03.252 --> 59:04.628
What do you mean?
- Marry me.

59:04.670 --> 59:06.463
Don't be crazy!
- Marry me!

59:06.505 --> 59:08.882
Have the baby, we'll be a family.
- You're delirious.

59:08.924 --> 59:10.717
Sorry.
- It's OK.

59:12.803 --> 59:17.140
How long do you think it'll take?
- I don't know, not long, I guess.

59:17.182 --> 59:19.101
Are you OK?
- Yeah. You?

59:19.142 --> 59:24.439
I feel like tearing somebody's head off.
<i>- Maria Coughlin?</i>

59:42.541 --> 59:45.711
How're you doing?
- I feel like smashing things up.

59:45.752 --> 59:47.462
Yeah, sometimes it gets like that.

59:47.504 --> 59:49.464
It's first time?
- What?

59:49.506 --> 59:51.592
It's first time here?
- Of course.

59:51.633 --> 59:54.052
That's some...
- Who the hell are you?

59:54.094 --> 59:55.762
John— John Bill. How're you doing?

59:55.804 --> 59:58.307
I already told you I feel like
punching somebody's lights out.

59:58.348 --> 01:00:01.018
Yeah, first time's kinda tough.
But you know what's an amazing thing?

01:00:01.059 --> 01:00:04.563
You come in here the first time, your
whole life's a mess, all this tension stuff...

01:00:04.605 --> 01:00:08.525
And then she goes in there,
and when she comes out, everything's fixed.

01:00:20.996 --> 01:00:26.001
What time is it?
- 5:03

01:00:26.084 --> 01:00:28.837
Did you mean that?
Would you marry me?

01:00:28.879 --> 01:00:30.005
Yes.

01:00:30.047 --> 01:00:33.091
Why?
- Because I want to.

01:00:33.133 --> 01:00:36.345
Not because you love me
or anything like that, huh?

01:00:36.386 --> 01:00:38.347
I respect and admire you.

01:00:38.639 --> 01:00:42.434
Isn't that love?
- No, that's respect and admiration.

01:00:42.643 --> 01:00:46.396
I think that's better than love.
- How?

01:00:46.438 --> 01:00:51.193
When people are in love, they do
all sorts of crazy things... They...

01:00:51.401 --> 01:00:56.073
...get jealous,
they lie, they cheat...

01:00:56.323 --> 01:01:00.160
...they kill themselves, kill each other.

01:01:00.494 --> 01:01:05.707
It doesn't have to be that way.
- Maybe.

01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:10.629
You'd be the father of a child
who you know isn't yours.

01:01:10.671 --> 01:01:14.383
Kids are kids. What does it matter?

01:01:14.424 --> 01:01:20.764
Do you trust me?
- If you trust me first.

01:01:20.889 --> 01:01:24.518
I trust you.
- Sure?

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.645
Yes.

01:01:35.654 --> 01:01:38.156
Then marry me.

01:01:38.866 --> 01:01:45.831
I'll marry you if you admit that
respect, admiration and trust equal love.

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:53.046
OK. They equal love.

01:02:32.628 --> 01:02:37.341
Good. I trust you.
Now it's your turn.

01:02:37.799 --> 01:02:40.552
What?
- Go on up.

01:02:40.928 --> 01:02:42.763
Maria, that's pretty high.

01:02:42.804 --> 01:02:44.890
Don't you trust me?
- Of course I do.

01:02:44.932 --> 01:02:46.141
You go on up!

01:02:46.183 --> 01:02:49.186
Maria, I'm twice your size.

01:02:49.228 --> 01:02:51.813
If I fall on you from that
height, I'll kill you.

01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:53.273
Trust me.

01:02:53.315 --> 01:02:55.192
This isn't a matter of trust!

01:02:55.234 --> 01:03:00.155
Matthew, go up!
I will break your fall, I promise.

01:03:19.174 --> 01:03:22.219
If I do this,
will you leave your mother?

01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:24.555
What?
- You heard me.

01:03:25.639 --> 01:03:28.016
Maybe.
- Not good enough.

01:03:28.058 --> 01:03:29.476
You're being selfish.

01:03:29.518 --> 01:03:33.188
The woman's a sadist.
- She's just in shock.

01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:34.815
What's a sadist?

01:03:34.857 --> 01:03:40.112
Your mother or me?
- Wait a minute, look!

01:03:45.284 --> 01:03:46.243
What is it?

01:03:46.285 --> 01:03:49.413
The lady said her and her husband
go to Cape Holiday every summer.

01:03:50.247 --> 01:03:52.958
There's another one.

01:03:58.297 --> 01:04:02.301
And over there, too.
There might be dozens.

01:04:02.342 --> 01:04:08.765
But how many of them many belong
to men who take the 5:15 train?

01:04:12.853 --> 01:04:14.313
Seven.

01:04:14.354 --> 01:04:18.609
There were ten before
the 5:15 came through.

01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:20.235
The white fancy one is gone.

01:04:20.277 --> 01:04:23.906
- The yellow pickup truck,
the Japanese model, 3...

01:04:24.156 --> 01:04:25.199
Three.

01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:28.744
What're you gonna do
when you find this man?

01:04:28.911 --> 01:04:31.622
I don't know yet.

01:04:39.254 --> 01:04:42.424
Peg, don't you think
Matthew is a handsome man?

01:04:42.466 --> 01:04:43.467
He's OK.

01:04:43.509 --> 01:04:45.636
Why hadn't you made a play for him?
- Mom?

01:04:45.677 --> 01:04:47.095
What?
- You're unbelievable.

01:04:47.137 --> 01:04:49.598
He's too old for Maria.
- So what do you want me to do about it?

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:50.641
Throw yourself at him.

01:04:50.682 --> 01:04:52.893
I do not throw myself
at men, Mom, OK?

01:04:52.935 --> 01:04:54.770
You used to.
- Shut up and watch TV!

01:04:54.811 --> 01:04:56.855
Don't you snap at me like that!

01:04:58.607 --> 01:05:00.817
He's not interested in me.

01:05:00.859 --> 01:05:02.736
That's what you think.
- What do you mean?

01:05:02.778 --> 01:05:04.029
I've seen the way he looks at you.

01:05:04.071 --> 01:05:05.906
Oh, right, and I've seen
the way he looks at Maria.

01:05:05.948 --> 01:05:08.742
Oh, you're just imagining it.
He likes you, I can tell.

01:05:08.784 --> 01:05:12.120
You can?
- She's not giving him any.

01:05:12.162 --> 01:05:13.539
What can I do for you, Matthew?

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:16.667
I want my job back.
- It's impossible.

01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:19.211
I'm sorry about vicing Ed's head.

01:05:19.253 --> 01:05:22.089
It's not what I'm talking about.
- What?

01:05:22.464 --> 01:05:25.008
You lied to us.
- When?

01:05:25.092 --> 01:05:28.846
When you applied for this job,
you said you had attended MIT.

01:05:28.887 --> 01:05:29.847
Did I say that?

01:05:29.888 --> 01:05:33.392
You never told us about your police record
and four years of reform school.

01:05:33.433 --> 01:05:34.434
You never asked.

01:05:34.476 --> 01:05:36.812
I gave you a lot of responsibility.
- I did a good job.

01:05:36.854 --> 01:05:38.146
That's besides the point.

01:05:38.188 --> 01:05:41.191
What difference does it make?

01:05:41.233 --> 01:05:43.819
I can't do it.
- Why not?

01:05:43.861 --> 01:05:48.240
People are afraid of you.
- I'll be nice. Really, I promise.

01:05:48.282 --> 01:05:49.825
Are you working now?
- Yes.

01:05:49.867 --> 01:05:52.035
For a competitor?
- I fix televisions.

01:05:52.077 --> 01:05:53.287
Well, work is work.

01:05:53.328 --> 01:05:58.292
I need something stable, with benefits.
Pension plan type stuff, you know?

01:05:58.333 --> 01:06:00.169
Why the sudden interest in stability?

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:02.713
I'm getting married.
- Really?

01:06:04.423 --> 01:06:08.802
Listen, I promise
I won't lose my temper any more...

01:06:08.844 --> 01:06:14.850
I won't make a fuss about
bad manufacturing or faulty designs...

01:06:15.642 --> 01:06:18.312
I won't care about quality at all.
I just...

01:06:18.353 --> 01:06:22.357
...need a job, with the normal
benefits for me and my dependents.

01:06:22.774 --> 01:06:25.611
I can't give your old job back.
- I'll take anything.

01:06:25.652 --> 01:06:28.405
Eligibility for benefits
starts after six months.

01:06:28.447 --> 01:06:31.325
Fine.
- You'll have to take a few steps down.

01:06:52.387 --> 01:06:55.807
Can I help you?
- Yeah, my TV is busted.

01:06:55.849 --> 01:07:00.145
Let's leave it here,
I'll have a look at it later on.

01:07:02.314 --> 01:07:05.108
Where's Matthew?
- He doesn't work here any more.

01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:07.528
What?
- Yeah, he got fired.

01:07:07.569 --> 01:07:10.322
You mean he quit?
- No, I mean he got fired.

01:07:10.364 --> 01:07:13.617
Bullshit! Nobody in the right mind would
fire Matthew. He can fix anything.

01:07:13.659 --> 01:07:16.870
Look, I'm telling you.
He got fired. He scared the customers.

01:07:16.912 --> 01:07:19.748
Well, what the hell do customers know?
Matthew is a genius!

01:07:19.831 --> 01:07:23.168
We don't need a genius.
We need somebody who can fix TVs.

01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:25.796
Yeah?
Well, that's your problem, pal!

01:07:27.631 --> 01:07:31.802
What do you want me to do with this TV?
- Get the damn thing out of my sight!

01:07:36.223 --> 01:07:42.521
"Vicissitude – 1. a) The quality
or state of being changeable;

01:07:42.563 --> 01:07:44.940
<i>...mutability.</i>

01:07:44.982 --> 01:07:50.279
<i>...b) Natural change or mutation visible

<i>...2. a) A favorable or unfavorable event

01:07:58.328 --> 01:08:05.377
<i>...A fluctuation of state or condition;

01:09:02.017 --> 01:09:04.310
Hey, mister?

01:09:13.278 --> 01:09:15.822
Who are you?
- My name's Maria.

01:09:15.863 --> 01:09:17.198
What do you want?

01:09:17.241 --> 01:09:20.160
I think I know your wife.

01:09:31.129 --> 01:09:32.923
What do you intend to do?

01:09:32.965 --> 01:09:36.301
I was in trouble
and she gave me some money.

01:09:36.385 --> 01:09:39.763
I just want to return it.

01:09:42.683 --> 01:09:44.643
What's her name?
- Who?

01:09:44.685 --> 01:09:47.395
Your wife's.
- Rachel.

01:09:47.563 --> 01:09:51.441
Will you tell her I say thank you?
- Yes.

01:10:15.799 --> 01:10:17.634
Ed...
- What... uh... what is it?

01:10:17.676 --> 01:10:18.802
Calm down, Ed.

01:10:18.844 --> 01:10:20.262
What do you want?

01:10:20.429 --> 01:10:22.014
I just happen to notice...

01:10:22.055 --> 01:10:26.351
...that these boards they were wiring
into the new models of the A67–9s.

01:10:26.393 --> 01:10:28.437
Brilliant. So what?

01:10:28.478 --> 01:10:31.148
We manufactured
these boards last year,

01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:34.151
...and too high a percentage of them
checked out faulty...

01:10:34.193 --> 01:10:38.280
in these higher powered, larger
memory units, so we stored them out back.

01:10:38.322 --> 01:10:39.990
I know that, Slaughter.

01:10:40.032 --> 01:10:44.328
Well, I just thought maybe there's been
some kind of a mistake or something—

01:10:44.411 --> 01:10:47.831
Why do you always have to be
such a pain in the neck, hm?

01:10:47.873 --> 01:10:49.082
Because it's my job.

01:10:49.124 --> 01:10:53.253
No! Your job is to put these together
the way we tell you to.

01:10:53.462 --> 01:10:55.547
Right.

01:11:02.179 --> 01:11:08.477
There. You see?
A67–9. See?

01:11:08.852 --> 01:11:12.981
Yeah, I see it.
- Satisfied?

01:11:19.112 --> 01:11:23.825
Since when do you watch TV?
- It was on when I came in.

01:11:24.034 --> 01:11:27.454
How was work today?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

01:11:27.955 --> 01:11:29.790
I decided to go back
to high school.

01:11:29.831 --> 01:11:33.627
Why?
- 'Cause I don't wanna work in a factory.

01:11:34.044 --> 01:11:36.463
When we get married,
you won't have to work at all.

01:11:36.505 --> 01:11:38.882
But I want to,
just not in a factory.

01:11:38.924 --> 01:11:42.344
How can you go to high school pregnant?
- Plenty of girls do it.

01:11:42.386 --> 01:11:45.430
I can teach you everything
you can learn in high school.

01:11:46.014 --> 01:11:47.975
I don't want that.
- Why not?

01:11:48.016 --> 01:11:50.227
'Cause I just don't want it.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.146
I met the man today.

01:11:53.355 --> 01:11:56.483
What man?
- The husband of the lady on the bench.

01:11:56.942 --> 01:12:00.070
All right, and what was he like?
- He was nervous.

01:12:00.112 --> 01:12:04.157
Did you ask him if his wife stole the baby?
- You don't care, do you?

01:12:04.199 --> 01:12:05.242
Care about what?

01:12:05.284 --> 01:12:07.369
Can you stop watching TV for a moment?
- No.

01:12:07.411 --> 01:12:10.372
Why?
- I had a bad day.

01:12:11.331 --> 01:12:14.793
I had to subvert my principles
and kowtow to an idiot.

01:12:15.085 --> 01:12:18.338
Television makes
these daily sacrifices possible.

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:21.258
Deadens the inner core of my being.

01:12:27.598 --> 01:12:29.474
Let's move away then.

01:12:29.516 --> 01:12:33.520
They have television everywhere.
There's no escape.

01:12:33.562 --> 01:12:35.647
Besides,
you won't leave your mother.

01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:38.525
I will if you quit your job.
- What?

01:12:38.567 --> 01:12:40.027
I don't like
what's happening with you.

01:12:40.068 --> 01:12:42.237
If you don't like your job,
then you shouldn't do it.

01:12:42.613 --> 01:12:46.783
Did you leave your mother?
- I'm not doing her any good staying.

01:12:48.118 --> 01:12:50.204
After the baby.
- No. Now.

01:12:50.245 --> 01:12:53.665
Maria, having a baby costs money.

01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:57.503
In six months I'll have full medical
coverage down at the plant.

01:12:57.544 --> 01:12:59.588
Just try to be practical.
Level-headed.

01:12:59.630 --> 01:13:02.174
What's so practical
about being level-headed?

01:13:02.216 --> 01:13:04.092
Would you move away
from the television?

01:13:04.134 --> 01:13:07.054
The news is on, and I wanna
hear about the earthquake victims.

01:13:07.095 --> 01:13:10.390
Why? What are you gonna do for them?
- Commiserate.

01:13:10.432 --> 01:13:11.683
What's commiserate?

01:13:11.725 --> 01:13:15.062
To express sympathy. Now move aside.
- Is that like compassion?

01:13:15.145 --> 01:13:17.523
Now, compassion means
to suffer with,

01:13:17.564 --> 01:13:20.400
which is different than
just feeling pity.

01:13:20.609 --> 01:13:23.070
You need a thesaurus.
- A what?

01:13:23.111 --> 01:13:27.241
A thesaurus.
It's like a dictionary of synonyms.

01:13:27.824 --> 01:13:29.243
Would you get me another beer?

01:13:29.284 --> 01:13:31.578
You're already drunk.
- No, I'm not. I don't get drunk.

01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:34.039
Your job is making you
boring and mean.

01:13:34.081 --> 01:13:37.584
My job is making me
a respectable member of society.

01:13:45.008 --> 01:13:47.427
Where are you going?

01:13:51.056 --> 01:13:54.476
Where're you going?
- To the supermarket. We need stuff.

01:13:54.518 --> 01:13:57.479
Come here,
your hair needs brushing.

01:13:58.730 --> 01:14:00.482
Did you clean the bathroom?
- Yes.

01:14:00.524 --> 01:14:02.484
I want you to do
this kitchen floor.

01:14:02.526 --> 01:14:04.444
I'll do it tonight
when everyone's asleep.

01:14:04.486 --> 01:14:06.071
Did you back him upstairs?
- Yes.

01:14:06.113 --> 01:14:08.532
Change all the bed sheets tomorrow,
before you go to work,

01:14:08.574 --> 01:14:10.868
and hang out the clothes
that are in the washing machine.

01:14:10.909 --> 01:14:12.035
OK...

01:14:12.077 --> 01:14:14.121
When's he gonna fix my sewing machine?

01:14:14.162 --> 01:14:18.375
You never use it.
- I don't use it because it's broken.

01:14:22.129 --> 01:14:25.257
He'll get around to it.

01:14:28.093 --> 01:14:31.054
Don't forget milk.
We need milk.

01:14:37.853 --> 01:14:39.980
I want you out of my house.

01:14:40.022 --> 01:14:42.733
Fine. But if I leave,
Maria leaves with me.

01:14:42.774 --> 01:14:43.734
No chance!

01:14:43.775 --> 01:14:47.279
We can go on like this for ever, Mom.
- Don't call me "Mom"!

01:14:47.321 --> 01:14:49.907
Like it or not, I'm here to stay.
- Freeloader!

01:14:49.948 --> 01:14:52.534
My paycheck kicks in to run
this household, too, you know.

01:14:52.576 --> 01:14:54.786
Who asked you for help, anyway?
- Maria did.

01:14:54.828 --> 01:14:57.998
Maria is a child.
- Soon to be my wife.

01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:01.126
Over my dead body.

01:15:01.168 --> 01:15:06.048
It's all set. We go to Town Hall
on Monday... You want a beer?

01:15:07.341 --> 01:15:09.218
What the hell's wrong with Peg?

01:15:09.259 --> 01:15:13.764
There is nothing wrong—with Peg.
I just don't wanna marry her.

01:15:13.972 --> 01:15:16.600
Peg would take a punk like you
and make a real man out of ya.

01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:19.728
I don't think I could stand bein'
a real man, to tell you the truth.

01:15:19.770 --> 01:15:22.272
You may be able to convince
Maria to marry you.

01:15:22.314 --> 01:15:25.192
But you'll never be able
to take her away from me.

01:15:25.234 --> 01:15:29.112
I know how to deal with Maria.
- You're a selfish bitch.

01:15:29.238 --> 01:15:31.823
I brought her into this
world, don't you forget that.

01:15:31.865 --> 01:15:33.867
You don't deserve her.
- Neither do you.

01:15:33.909 --> 01:15:37.287
You wanna arm-wrestle about it?

01:15:45.963 --> 01:15:50.092
We'll drink for it.
- What?

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:53.887
We'll drink for it.
Whoever's left standing, wins.

01:15:54.304 --> 01:15:57.850
Jean, I can drink you under the table.
- That's what you think.

01:15:58.058 --> 01:16:01.103
Scotch is your poison,
isn't it? Mine's gin.

01:16:03.105 --> 01:16:04.815
Jean, this is
gonna be way too easy.

01:16:04.857 --> 01:16:07.317
We'll get you out of
my house one way or another.

01:16:07.359 --> 01:16:10.237
You won't do it this way.
- You're a fool of high ideal, pal.

01:16:10.279 --> 01:16:12.656
You're gonna regret
this whole thing in the morning, Mom.

01:16:12.698 --> 01:16:15.701
Shot for shot. There's
two more bottles under the sink.

01:16:15.742 --> 01:16:18.704
And don't you ever call me Mom!

01:16:19.079 --> 01:16:23.876
To motherhood!
- Bastard!

01:16:35.929 --> 01:16:39.057
Coffee.
- Look, I don't want any trouble.

01:16:39.099 --> 01:16:40.434
Coffee.
- We're closing up.

01:16:40.475 --> 01:16:42.394
Milk, no sugar.

01:16:42.769 --> 01:16:44.813
Hi!
- Hi!

01:16:44.855 --> 01:16:46.023
You work late?

01:16:46.064 --> 01:16:49.443
They smashed my car up again:
tipped it over to the street.

01:16:49.484 --> 01:16:51.904
Bastards!
- I'm doing what I believe in.

01:16:51.945 --> 01:16:56.158
And if you're gonna do that, you got to be
ready to take a certain amount of shit.

01:16:56.909 --> 01:16:58.911
I'm going to have an abortion.

01:16:58.952 --> 01:17:01.747
Are you sure it's what you want?
- Yes.

01:17:01.997 --> 01:17:03.081
You have to be sure.

01:17:03.123 --> 01:17:05.709
You have to be sure
or nothing ever changes.

01:17:05.834 --> 01:17:09.421
People spend their entire lives
making the same mistakes again and again.

01:17:09.463 --> 01:17:10.172
I'm sure.

01:17:10.214 --> 01:17:12.633
Are you alone?
- I met a man.

01:17:12.674 --> 01:17:15.719
He knows you're pregnant?
- He wants to marry me.

01:17:15.761 --> 01:17:16.929
Do you want that?

01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:20.641
Sometimes I'm sure I do,
other times I'm not so certain.

01:17:20.682 --> 01:17:23.852
He's a good man,
but he's out of control. It seems like...

01:17:23.894 --> 01:17:26.063
...meeting me has made him
capable and ready.

01:17:26.104 --> 01:17:28.732
I mean to give himself
completely, you know.

01:17:28.815 --> 01:17:31.777
Isn't that a good thing?
- I like him the way he is.

01:17:31.818 --> 01:17:32.945
How is he?

01:17:32.986 --> 01:17:36.698
Dangerous... but sincere.

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:41.286
Sincerely dangerous?
- No. Dangerous because he's sincere.

01:17:41.328 --> 01:17:47.084
I see... And now he's becoming insincere?
- Not exactly, he's just sort of numb.

01:17:47.125 --> 01:17:49.753
You changed him.
- I didn't mean to, honest.

01:17:49.795 --> 01:17:53.632
No, you didn't mean to, but still it happens.
People change each other.

01:17:53.674 --> 01:17:56.009
People start becoming
what others want them to be.

01:17:56.051 --> 01:17:58.303
I just want him to be himself.

01:17:58.345 --> 01:18:00.514
Impossible.
- Really?

01:18:00.556 --> 01:18:03.725
How can you expect him to stay
the same when you've come into his life?

01:18:03.767 --> 01:18:05.310
Then you think I should leave him?

01:18:05.352 --> 01:18:08.897
Look... hasn't he changed you?
- I guess so.

01:18:08.939 --> 01:18:12.025
There you go.
- I don't understand.

01:18:12.067 --> 01:18:15.904
You don't have to understand.
Here's my husband.

01:18:16.113 --> 01:18:17.739
I'll be there tomorrow.

01:18:17.781 --> 01:18:21.368
As long as you know what you're doing.
- I know what I'm doing.

01:18:28.625 --> 01:18:33.130
Here...
let me pour you another one, Jean.

01:18:35.007 --> 01:18:36.675
Thanks.

01:18:43.348 --> 01:18:44.808
Shit!

01:18:45.184 --> 01:18:49.605
I've been meaning to ask you something.
- What's that?

01:18:49.897 --> 01:18:54.109
What's your mother like?
- I don't remember her.

01:18:54.234 --> 01:18:59.573
You were that young when she died?
- She died giving birth to me.

01:18:59.615 --> 01:19:01.909
No!
- It's the truth.

01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:04.745
That's terrible.
- I agree.

01:19:04.786 --> 01:19:07.331
It's so unfair.
- Of course.

01:19:07.372 --> 01:19:11.293
I feel so sorry for your father.
- I had a feeling you two had hit it off.

01:19:11.335 --> 01:19:14.630
You can't blame him for hating you.
- I never said he hated me.

01:19:14.671 --> 01:19:17.966
But you don't get along.
- No, we don't get along.

01:19:18.008 --> 01:19:19.468
But, then, neither do you and Maria.

01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:23.472
Me and Maria will get along
just fine once you're out of the picture.

01:19:23.805 --> 01:19:25.349
She'll waste away here with you.

01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:27.726
And what the hell kind of life are
<i>you gonna be able to give her?</i>

01:19:27.768 --> 01:19:29.603
Any kind of life she wants.

01:19:29.645 --> 01:19:32.022
She wants to stay with me.
- Says who?

01:19:32.064 --> 01:19:33.815
Look, let me tell you something, 'cause...

01:19:33.857 --> 01:19:36.693
...you know, it's not like I hated you
right off the bat or anything.

01:19:36.735 --> 01:19:38.195
Appreciate that.

01:19:40.322 --> 01:19:44.409
It's just that I don't wanna see Maria make
the same mistake I made—and that Peg made.

01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:45.827
What mistake is that?

01:19:45.869 --> 01:19:47.120
Men.
- Ah.

01:19:47.162 --> 01:19:50.499
Children are OK, but
marriage is always a last resort.

01:19:50.541 --> 01:19:52.876
A woman can have anything she wants.
Anything!

01:19:52.918 --> 01:19:56.797
But we always make the mistake of
thinking we need a man to do it.

01:19:57.172 --> 01:20:00.676
Well, correct me if I'm wrong but...

01:20:00.717 --> 01:20:04.680
...isn't it sort of impossible to have
a baby without a man around the house?

01:20:04.721 --> 01:20:10.435
Wake up, Matthew, this is the 20th century.
You can be artificially inseminated.

01:20:10.477 --> 01:20:13.897
With that sperm banks and everything
the possibilities are endless.

01:20:13.939 --> 01:20:17.192
You're out of your mind.
- I'm fed up, that's all.

01:20:17.401 --> 01:20:18.902
You know, when my husband died, I—

01:20:18.944 --> 01:20:22.656
...sure, I was in shock, but...
what I really felt was relief.

01:20:22.698 --> 01:20:24.783
What?
- Relief, yeah.

01:20:25.367 --> 01:20:28.203
That man poisoned
the past 20 years of my life.

01:20:28.412 --> 01:20:31.790
Some nights I'd lay awake
hoping he'd just sort of—

01:20:31.832 --> 01:20:34.293
...well, disappear or something,
and then, whack...!

01:20:34.334 --> 01:20:37.588
...Maria, with one slap,
knocks him right out of my life.

01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:40.883
Incredible! I was amazed.
The girl's a genius!

01:20:43.343 --> 01:20:47.681
Do you love him?
- Who?

01:20:47.723 --> 01:20:51.018
Your father.
- I don't love anybody.

01:20:51.059 --> 01:20:56.356
Yeah, right, I keep forgetting.
Drink up!

01:21:06.491 --> 01:21:08.994
You know...

01:21:09.578 --> 01:21:12.789
...with me and my dad...

01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:19.963
...it's like our... relationship is a
record album... you know?

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:24.468
And the phonograph
that the record is playing on...

01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:31.391
...has a very old and worn-out needle.
You know what I'm saying?

01:21:32.768 --> 01:21:37.648
There are these... skips...

01:21:38.982 --> 01:21:42.194
...bad skips...

01:21:43.028 --> 01:21:46.198
...painful gouges...

01:21:46.657 --> 01:21:51.495
But in your head
you compensate for it, you know.

01:21:51.995 --> 01:21:56.291
You keep the beat
because you know the song.

01:22:00.337 --> 01:22:06.093
Most people buy laser disks now,
you know, CDs...

01:22:06.134 --> 01:22:09.054
they don't wear out.

01:22:09.638 --> 01:22:16.478
You can't damage the surface of CDs.
They are digital, not analog.

01:22:17.104 --> 01:22:22.192
Would you like...
for me to explain you, Jean,

01:22:22.484 --> 01:22:25.571
...the difference between
digital and analog recording?

01:22:25.863 --> 01:22:26.905
No.

01:22:26.947 --> 01:22:31.368
It's really fascinating stuff.
- I'm sure it is.

01:22:38.083 --> 01:22:40.586
Jean...
- Huh?

01:22:41.170 --> 01:22:44.131
I think...

01:22:44.548 --> 01:22:47.926
I think I'm actually drunk.

01:22:49.845 --> 01:22:53.807
I think so, too.

01:22:59.021 --> 01:23:02.649
Matthew...
- What?

01:23:52.658 --> 01:23:56.328
What's goin' on here, mom?
- None of your business. Pick up that bottle!

01:23:56.411 --> 01:23:58.705
You should've been
home half an hour ago.

01:23:58.747 --> 01:24:01.458
The other girl got sick. What is this?
- What?

01:24:01.542 --> 01:24:03.544
This isn't gin.
- Oh, that.

01:24:03.585 --> 01:24:05.712
This is water.
- Give me that.

01:24:05.754 --> 01:24:07.339
Why are you watering down the gin, Mom?

01:24:07.381 --> 01:24:10.217
I'm not watering down the gin,
I'm using that to water the plants.

01:24:10.259 --> 01:24:11.635
Ah—what plants?

01:24:11.677 --> 01:24:15.097
Will you stop asking stupid questions
and just go on up to bed?

01:24:15.389 --> 01:24:18.183
Oh, this is Scotch, it's real!

01:24:38.495 --> 01:24:41.206
Maria!

01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:44.459
What do you want?
- I just wanted to apologize.

01:24:44.543 --> 01:24:47.921
Oh, great. What happened
to your football scholarship?

01:24:47.963 --> 01:24:50.632
I didn't get it,
I failed my college entrance exam.

01:24:50.674 --> 01:24:52.718
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:24:52.759 --> 01:24:58.140
Maria, I want you to forgive me.
- Sure. Here, give me a lift.

01:24:58.182 --> 01:25:01.268
Let me take these.
- Thanks.

01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:05.647
What did you do to your hair?
- Nothing.

01:25:06.106 --> 01:25:08.483
I didn't know you wore glasses.

01:25:12.237 --> 01:25:14.740
Matthew!
- Hmmmh...

01:25:38.764 --> 01:25:41.266
Get your hands off me, Anthony.

01:25:41.308 --> 01:25:43.185
Don't get so high on Maria
with me, Maria.

01:25:43.227 --> 01:25:46.605
I'm not being high on Maria, just
don't want your hands anywhere near me.

01:25:46.647 --> 01:25:48.440
Now get me my groceries
out of the trunk.

01:25:48.482 --> 01:25:50.526
It's true about you and
that psycho case, isn't it?

01:25:50.567 --> 01:25:52.778
What psycho case?
- Matthew Slaughter.

01:25:52.819 --> 01:25:55.447
Yes. As a matter of fact, it is.
We're getting married on Monday.

01:25:55.489 --> 01:25:59.076
Now get me my groceries out of the trunk!
- What?

01:25:59.117 --> 01:26:01.411
Give me the keys, I can't do this—
- You can't do that!

01:26:01.453 --> 01:26:03.956
Why not?
- What about us?

01:26:07.084 --> 01:26:08.627
It's about time...

01:26:08.669 --> 01:26:12.256
I wanted a cup of tea,
but there's no milk.

01:26:27.396 --> 01:26:32.985
Maria, I left my hairclip up in Peg's room.
Can you go get it for me?

01:26:36.196 --> 01:26:37.990
Did you hear me?

01:26:38.031 --> 01:26:41.827
Why can't you get it yourself?
- What?

01:26:41.869 --> 01:26:43.495
Mom, you're a normal, healthy woman.

01:26:43.537 --> 01:26:47.457
I don't see why I have to do
every little thing for you.

01:26:48.625 --> 01:26:50.043
What's gotten into you?

01:26:50.085 --> 01:26:54.047
Nothing's gotten into me.
I'm just—telling you the way it is.

01:27:00.596 --> 01:27:03.432
Go get my hairclip.

01:27:07.436 --> 01:27:09.980
Listen, Mom...

01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:13.233
I'm sorry about Dad.

01:27:13.442 --> 01:27:15.569
Are you going to marry Matthew?

01:27:15.819 --> 01:27:17.487
Maybe.

01:27:19.114 --> 01:27:21.533
It's your life.
You can do what you want with it.

01:27:21.575 --> 01:27:24.578
That's right, it's my life,
I'll do what I want with it.

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:26.955
Go get my hairclip!

01:28:11.625 --> 01:28:15.712
Here you go.
I'm going to bed. Good night.

01:29:07.222 --> 01:29:12.686
Emphysema? Heart disease? Venereal disease?
- No.

01:29:12.728 --> 01:29:15.063
Are you allergic to penicillin?
- No.

01:29:15.105 --> 01:29:17.691
Any other prescribed medication?
- No.

01:29:17.733 --> 01:29:19.568
Other allergies?
- No.

01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:23.113
Have you been hospitalized
for any illness in the past 6 months?

01:29:23.155 --> 01:29:24.072
No.

01:29:24.114 --> 01:29:28.118
Have you had an abortion before?
-No.

01:29:28.368 --> 01:29:31.288
Soc. Security number?
- Is Nurse Paine here?

01:29:31.330 --> 01:29:33.457
Why?
- No reason.

01:29:33.498 --> 01:29:37.085
She's off today.
Soc. Security number?

01:29:37.544 --> 01:29:43.717
081-50-9199.
- O.K.

01:29:46.678 --> 01:29:49.306
Drink this.

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:53.685
What is it?
- Just drink it and lean back.

01:29:59.191 --> 01:30:04.238
Will this hurt?
- Don't worry, it's a simple procedure.

01:30:50.492 --> 01:30:51.535
Yes, Matthew?

01:30:51.577 --> 01:30:54.788
Have you got a minute?
- Sure. What is it?

01:31:00.586 --> 01:31:03.589
I just have a question.
I was a little confused.

01:31:03.630 --> 01:31:08.677
The specifications manual for the new model
reassembling calls for a particular piece,

01:31:08.886 --> 01:31:13.515
...a circuit board, No. A67–9—
- I know the piece.

01:31:13.682 --> 01:31:18.937
Oh, it's just that I remember that we...
manufactured that piece last year, and

01:31:18.979 --> 01:31:22.149
...an unusually high number of them
checked out to be faulty.

01:31:22.357 --> 01:31:23.859
I'm aware of that.

01:31:23.901 --> 01:31:29.198
It was a defect in the pressing of the b—
- Matthew, I understand!

01:31:31.074 --> 01:31:32.534
Oh.

01:31:38.290 --> 01:31:42.169
Matthew, listen.
I appreciate your diligence.

01:31:42.211 --> 01:31:46.798
But there are people in this company,
highly qualified people,

01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:51.887
...people in important positions, who are
making decisions about these things.

01:31:51.929 --> 01:31:55.349
And they know what they're doing!
- Mm-hmm.

01:31:55.474 --> 01:32:01.271
Yeah. If these people saw fit
to include part A67-9 in the new model,

01:32:01.855 --> 01:32:06.068
...well, then we have to trust
that they have reasons for doing so.

01:32:06.109 --> 01:32:07.986
Agreed?

01:32:15.577 --> 01:32:17.246
Yes.

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:27.631
So, Matthew, once again, thank you
for your diligence and dedication.

01:32:27.673 --> 01:32:33.136
But please, just go back
down there. Do your job!

01:32:34.513 --> 01:32:36.348
Yes, sir.
- Excuse me?

01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:38.725
I'm sorry.
- Good.

01:32:39.268 --> 01:32:41.812
I quit.

01:32:53.156 --> 01:32:55.117
Do you want to go home now?

01:32:55.158 --> 01:32:58.871
No, I have some things to do.

01:33:02.749 --> 01:33:05.794
I'll be home later.

01:34:14.196 --> 01:34:16.532
They found him this morning.

01:34:16.573 --> 01:34:21.203
The police got an unidentified
phone call, apparently.

01:34:21.370 --> 01:34:25.541
They say he's okay.
Just fine.

01:35:30.522 --> 01:35:35.277
What are you doing here?
- I live here.

01:35:35.485 --> 01:35:38.280
Come on home, Matthew.
- No.

01:35:38.697 --> 01:35:41.617
Matthew, I spent all my life
lookin' out after you. Now you desert me?

01:35:42.034 --> 01:35:45.204
The two of us are
better off on our own.

01:35:46.038 --> 01:35:51.251
You're selfish.
- I'm just trying to be responsible.

01:35:52.085 --> 01:35:53.712
You're a fool, Matthew.

01:35:54.713 --> 01:35:58.550
I've heard all about his, I mean
everybody knows that girl's kid isn't yours.

01:35:58.592 --> 01:35:59.384
Big deal.

01:35:59.426 --> 01:36:01.845
Big deal? She's just
taking advantage of you.

01:36:01.887 --> 01:36:03.722
We better not talk about this, Dad.

01:36:03.764 --> 01:36:07.643
Matthew, you'll always be a fool,
you need somebody to look after you.

01:36:07.684 --> 01:36:09.269
Why don't you just say it?
- Say what?

01:36:09.311 --> 01:36:11.522
That you want me to come home
because you're—lonely.

01:36:11.563 --> 01:36:12.731
Oh, bullshit!

01:36:12.773 --> 01:36:14.233
Why don't you just say
that you're sorry...

01:36:14.274 --> 01:36:16.151
...for the way things never seemed
to work out between us?

01:36:16.193 --> 01:36:18.445
What are you saying? It's my fault?
- It's nobody's fault.

01:36:18.487 --> 01:36:21.281
It's that little slut's fault. That's whose fault it is!
- Watch it, Dad.

01:36:21.323 --> 01:36:22.908
Fucking, low-life bitch!

01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:25.577
You better get out of here, Dad.
- What're you gonna do about it?

01:36:25.619 --> 01:36:27.788
I'm warning you, Dad.
- Come on, what're you gonna do about it?

01:36:27.829 --> 01:36:30.707
I swear to god, I'm gonna knock you out.

01:36:32.209 --> 01:36:36.797
Try it. I'll knock
your ass through your face.

01:36:36.839 --> 01:36:38.632
Come on, try it.

01:36:38.674 --> 01:36:41.969
What's the matter?
You afraid, huh?

01:37:39.735 --> 01:37:43.280
Are you okay?

01:37:43.822 --> 01:37:45.365
I quit.

01:37:45.407 --> 01:37:48.410
What?
- I quit my job.

01:37:48.452 --> 01:37:51.246
Why?

01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:02.382
You're right. We got to get out of here.
This is no place to raise a child.

01:38:07.888 --> 01:38:11.058
Maria...

01:38:12.059 --> 01:38:17.439
I woke up in Peg's...
bed this morning...

01:38:18.273 --> 01:38:22.277
I don't know—
- Stop.

01:38:26.657 --> 01:38:29.493
I've had an abortion.

01:38:32.579 --> 01:38:36.542
I don't want to get married.

01:38:59.773 --> 01:39:03.026
I bought you this.

01:39:06.572 --> 01:39:09.241
And who do you think you are?
- Leave me alone!

01:39:09.283 --> 01:39:11.118
What you've done to my cabinets?

01:39:11.159 --> 01:39:14.913
So get a hammer, I'll fix it.
- Do you want something to eat?

01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:57.748
That man physically socked me,
and you rehired him!

01:39:57.789 --> 01:39:59.583
Look! Look what I'm dealing with!

01:39:59.625 --> 01:40:01.668
I need you to get in there
and get the guy out!

01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:04.838
Going back in there?
Are you out of your mind?

01:41:05.232 --> 01:41:10.404
What happened?
- I don't know. It must not be any good.

01:41:10.779 --> 01:41:13.782
Are you sure?

01:41:14.324 --> 01:41:16.201
No.

01:41:16.577 --> 01:41:20.789
You mean it might still go off?

01:41:21.748 --> 01:41:24.626
I guess so.

01:42:26.563 --> 01:42:30.609
I'm sorry. I lost my head.
- It's okay.

01:42:30.651 --> 01:42:32.444
What are we gonna do now?

01:42:32.486 --> 01:42:35.489
We could run.
- We'd never make it.

01:42:35.531 --> 01:42:38.617
I'll tell them that was my fault.
- They'd never believe you.

01:42:38.659 --> 01:42:40.744
I don't care
if they believe me or not.

01:42:41.828 --> 01:42:43.622
Why've you done this?

01:42:43.914 --> 01:42:47.501
Done what?
- Why'd you put up with me like this?

01:42:47.543 --> 01:42:52.172
Somebody had to.
- But why you?

01:42:52.798 --> 01:42:57.135
I just happened to be here.
