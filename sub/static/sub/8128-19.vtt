05:57.357 --> 06:00.158
Hey, you don't have to rush back
to the store, do you, hey?      

06:00.160 --> 06:02.226
     You can take a little break
          from work, George.    

06:02.228 --> 06:04.628
Oh, I don't know, Mr. Bunker.   
            Oh, come on, George.

06:04.630 --> 06:07.031
          Don't let no bosses   
    push you around that way.   

06:07.033 --> 06:09.233
  You see, that's why these guys
    hires kids like this.       

06:09.235 --> 06:10.901
            To take advantage   
                    of them.    

06:10.903 --> 06:12.803
         Now, you just tell them

06:12.805 --> 06:14.405
        the customer's always   
            right, George,      

06:14.407 --> 06:15.606
          and I'm Archie Bunker,
            the customer,       

06:15.608 --> 06:17.475
            and I'm telling you 
        you can take a break.   

06:17.477 --> 06:19.210
Okay, Mr. Bunker.               

06:19.212 --> 06:20.644
        Arch, what if he        
        gets in trouble?        

06:20.646 --> 06:22.380
            He ain't going to   
              get in no trouble.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.514
         I'll handle everything.

06:23.516 --> 06:24.715
        Just stay out of this   

06:24.717 --> 06:27.218
     and hold the door will you,
            you meathead?       

06:27.220 --> 06:30.054
        Oh! Meat! I forgot      
 to put the meat in the freezer.

06:32.757 --> 06:34.025
          ARCHIE:               
  There's something here.       

06:34.027 --> 06:37.261
I don't think                   
it's working, Mr. Bunker.       

06:38.630 --> 06:40.031
              Listen.           

06:40.033 --> 06:43.701
    You don't understand.       
    It's a very tricky job here.

06:43.703 --> 06:45.103
Yeah, but you got to have       

06:45.105 --> 06:47.838
little curly bits of wood       
coming out up there.            

06:47.840 --> 06:51.175
      I know. I know all about  
the curly bits of wood there.   

06:51.177 --> 06:52.443
              But you see, uh...

06:52.445 --> 06:54.479
        I tell you what, George.
          See the chair there?  

06:54.481 --> 06:57.281
     Why don't you just sit down
         in the chair. Go on.   

06:57.283 --> 07:00.385
      And you just watch me work
         and don't talk, see?   

07:00.387 --> 07:02.786
Okay, Mr. Bunker.               
I like watching.                

07:02.788 --> 07:05.556
      Yeah, you watch, George.  
Maybe you'll learn something.   

07:05.558 --> 07:06.590
          Here we go.

07:24.343 --> 07:27.845
        Hey, George, do you know
            some other song?    

07:29.348 --> 07:31.849
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Bunker.      
                     Oh, no, no.

07:31.851 --> 07:34.652
    Don't worry about it, kid.  
 I ain't mad at you or anything.

07:34.654 --> 07:37.988
  It's just that that one kind  
    of grapes on my nerves.     

07:37.990 --> 07:41.259
Would you like me to fix        
that plane for you, Mr. Bunker? 

07:41.261 --> 07:42.460
            Heh-heh, no, George.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.695
            I tell you what.    
                 Here, here.    

07:44.697 --> 07:46.497
      Give me your hand, George.
          Give me your hand.    

07:46.499 --> 07:48.732
I'm going to take you right into
      the kitchen in here.      

07:48.734 --> 07:51.169
See, George, when you           
get into the kitchen,           

07:51.171 --> 07:53.938
you ask Gloria to give          
you a cookie.                   

07:53.940 --> 07:58.543
And then you tell Gloria to give
you a can of beer for me.       

07:58.545 --> 08:00.178
You think you can do            
them two things?                

08:00.180 --> 08:02.746
            Sure, Mr. Bunker.   
Good! Good.                     

08:02.748 --> 08:04.449
          You go ahead, Georgie.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.884
        Yeah, good boy, Georgie.
            Good boy.           

08:06.886 --> 08:09.287
 That's the way you got to talk 
    to them. Keep them calm.    

08:09.289 --> 08:11.089
            You talked to him   
              like he was a dog.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.490
What are you talking about?     

08:12.492 --> 08:15.093
 I thought you were going to pat
     him and toss him a bone.   

08:15.095 --> 08:18.796
If I did, at least              
he'd fetch it. You'd eat it.    

08:21.333 --> 08:24.902
    It's nice the way George    
    is always smiling.          

08:24.904 --> 08:26.770
He always looks so happy.       

08:26.772 --> 08:28.906
Edith, you don't understand     
them people, you see?           

08:28.908 --> 08:31.509
Being happy is just             
a part of being crazy.          

08:31.511 --> 08:33.910
                     What? What?

08:33.913 --> 08:35.480
That's right.                   

08:35.482 --> 08:38.349
Why do you think them people    
go around smiling all the time? 

08:38.351 --> 08:42.686
Because they ain't smart enough 
to know how lousy everything is.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.888
I'm going to go check           
on that beer in there.          

08:44.890 --> 08:47.057
You see, he don't move          
as fast as you do.              

08:47.059 --> 08:49.760
Uh, George,                     
I can't reach.                  

08:49.762 --> 08:50.794
                 Oh, I'll do it.

08:50.796 --> 08:52.130
         Okay.                  

08:52.132 --> 08:54.064
         Oh.                    

08:54.066 --> 08:56.167
             Hey, hey, hey, hey!
                 What's this?   

08:56.169 --> 08:58.102
                    What's this?
Oh, hiya, Daddy.                

08:58.104 --> 09:00.104
You can put me down now,        
George. Thank you.              

09:00.106 --> 09:02.006
George is helping me            
put the groceries away.         

09:02.008 --> 09:04.775
That's right, Mr. Bunker.       
I'm just helping my girlfriend. 

09:04.777 --> 09:05.843
    You're helping your what?   

09:05.845 --> 09:08.212
My girlfriend.                  
                Your girlfriend?

09:08.214 --> 09:10.314
      That's right, Daddy,      
         we're friends.         

09:10.316 --> 09:12.049
                Uh, George,     
                  do me a favor.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.952
            Don't lift her up in
        the air no more, huh?   

09:14.954 --> 09:16.154
Okay, Mr. Bunker.               

09:16.156 --> 09:17.555
            Yeah. Remember that,
                huh, George?    

09:17.557 --> 09:18.956
Hey, you, you jerk.             

09:18.958 --> 09:21.259
You better get out in the       
kitchen and protect your wife.  

09:21.261 --> 09:22.726
                        What?   

09:22.728 --> 09:25.163
He's lifting her up in the air. 
She's getting him excited.      

09:25.165 --> 09:26.864
You know what                   
he's calling her?               

09:26.866 --> 09:28.699
He's calling her                
his girlfriend!                 

09:28.701 --> 09:30.134
Do you like that?               

09:30.136 --> 09:32.703
    Oh, Arch, it doesn't mean   
    the same thing to George.   

09:32.705 --> 09:33.771
Oh, ho, ho, listen.             

09:33.773 --> 09:35.173
Them people                     
ain't got much mind,            

09:35.175 --> 09:39.310
but what mind they got          
is all on the one track.        

09:39.312 --> 09:41.379
What do you mean, Archie?       

09:41.381 --> 09:43.247
This ain't for you.             

09:43.249 --> 09:46.917
         He's talking about sex.
Shush in front of Edith.        

09:46.919 --> 09:48.452
            Arch, that's a myth!

09:48.454 --> 09:51.389
 Retarded people have no more of
  a sex drive than anybody else.

09:51.391 --> 09:55.560
Oh, yeah, then why are you      
on automatic all the time?      

09:59.698 --> 10:03.267
Archie, I've got to talk to you.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.902
          Why? What do you      
        want to talk about?     

10:04.904 --> 10:06.437
Well, it's private.             

10:06.439 --> 10:09.073
 Oh, Edith, come on, will you?  
    What? What? What?           

10:09.075 --> 10:12.176
I've got to go                  
to the bathroom.                

10:12.178 --> 10:14.878
                    Well, go to 
                the bathroom.   

10:14.880 --> 10:16.747
I can't.                        

10:16.749 --> 10:18.349
                  Why can't you?

10:18.351 --> 10:21.018
You got the door.               

10:28.493 --> 10:29.893
                    What do you 
                  want me to do?

10:29.895 --> 10:32.129
    Carry it all the way back   
             upstairs here?     

10:32.131 --> 10:36.267
I got to have privacy.          
Suppose somebody comes by?      

10:38.870 --> 10:42.573
    Tell you what you do. Sing, 
  and nobody will come near you.

10:46.811 --> 10:48.713
          Gloria, could I have  
         Mr. Bunker's beer now? 

10:48.715 --> 10:50.781
             I think I'd better 
              be getting back.  

10:50.783 --> 10:52.750
Oh, sure. Here                  
you go, George.                 

10:52.752 --> 10:54.652
                         Thanks.
[LAUGHS]                        

10:54.654 --> 10:58.055
          Gloria, can I carry   
        your bags next time too?

10:58.057 --> 10:59.923
Oh, of course                   
you can, George.                

10:59.925 --> 11:02.159
        Thanks, Gloria.         

11:02.161 --> 11:03.327
        I wasn't talking        
        no different...         

11:03.329 --> 11:05.329
                          Shush!
            Shush, you!         

11:05.331 --> 11:07.398
Here you go, Mr. Bunker.        
                Oh!             

11:07.400 --> 11:09.900
      George, you brung me      
    back out my beer, here.     

11:09.902 --> 11:11.969
            George,             
      you done a good job!      

11:11.971 --> 11:13.170
                  Come on, Arch.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.005
I guess I'd better              
be going now.                   

11:15.007 --> 11:16.507
              No, wait a minute.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.709
There's something I want to tell
     you. Hang on to that.      

11:18.711 --> 11:21.178
      George, I want to give you
        a little advice.        

11:21.180 --> 11:24.282
 You shouldn't go lifting girls 
 up in the air no more, George. 

11:24.284 --> 11:25.316
                  See?          

11:25.318 --> 11:27.318
                 Because they're
                  very delicate.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.186
        And you're strong.      
    You might hurt them, see?   

11:29.188 --> 11:30.821
      You heard that old saying,
                George?         

11:30.823 --> 11:33.791
         Girls are made of sugar
            and spice--         

11:33.793 --> 11:35.826
              All right, Arch.  
            Will you cut it out?

11:35.828 --> 11:39.730
    Will you shut up? I know how
    to talk to a D-U-M-M-Y.     

11:39.732 --> 11:42.333
         I'm not dumb!          

11:42.335 --> 11:44.835
I know how to spell             
and I'm not dumb.               

11:44.837 --> 11:46.970
    Oh, jeez, I didn't know     
      you spelled, George.      

11:46.972 --> 11:50.107
 You're making fun of me like   
some bad boys on my street do.  

11:50.109 --> 11:51.509
                    No, I ain't.
         Yes, you are.          

11:51.511 --> 11:55.946
Well, I can show you something, 
          Mr. Bunker.           

11:55.948 --> 11:57.648
      I'm gonna show you.       

11:57.650 --> 11:59.983
    I'm gonna show you all.     

11:59.985 --> 12:01.952

17:39.792 --> 17:41.625
You don't know the half of it.  

17:41.627 --> 17:43.293
Let me ask you something.       

17:43.295 --> 17:45.228
     Could you hire my boy      
      down where you work?      

17:45.230 --> 17:48.331
    Where I work? No.           

17:48.333 --> 17:51.234
  To start with, you got to be  
    on your toes, you know?     

17:51.236 --> 17:55.639
And to be on your toes, you got 
  to know where your toes are.  

17:57.208 --> 17:58.809
              Funny.            

17:58.811 --> 18:00.110

18:00.112 --> 18:02.146
    Everybody's got excuses.    

18:02.148 --> 18:03.647
 You see, that's why these kids 

18:03.649 --> 18:06.016
    don't have a real chance    
    to hold onto jobs.          

18:06.018 --> 18:08.318
    Now, if they did,           
      they would do great.      

18:08.320 --> 18:11.655
Yeah, but after all, you know   
the reverse advice is true.     

18:11.657 --> 18:15.192
I mean, uh, people do get       
a little scared of them kids.   

18:15.194 --> 18:17.494
You know, they don't know       
what they're going to do.       

18:17.496 --> 18:18.796
Maybe they'd play               
with matches.                   

18:18.798 --> 18:19.830
            Matches?            

18:19.832 --> 18:21.231
Yeah, there was a kid like that 

18:21.233 --> 18:23.801
    where Edith and me used     
    to live on Union Street.    

18:23.803 --> 18:26.236
    He set fire to a canary.    

18:28.106 --> 18:30.507
    You're not talking about    

18:30.509 --> 18:32.475
        somebody who was        
     mentally handicapped.      

18:32.477 --> 18:34.178
You're talking about pyromania. 

18:34.180 --> 18:37.781
 No, no. I think the family was 
 from Hungaria. Where is that?

these things.

of yours in one of them homes?

    My kid doesn't have to weave
      baskets, you understand?

        He's going to make it   
    on his own like his brother.

     another one like that?

      passed his bar exam.

     I'm trying to make, Bunker,

19:45.651 --> 19:47.151
          is it's not inherited.

         about George.          

20:06.172 --> 20:08.038
        I mean, how did         
      that happen to him?       

20:08.040 --> 20:09.439
      When he was a baby,       

20:09.441 --> 20:12.776
did someone throw him up in the 
  air and forget to catch him?  

20:14.112 --> 20:16.680
  It's a common birth defect.   

20:16.682 --> 20:18.515
 The doctors call it "anoxia."  

20:18.517 --> 20:20.918
 It means he didn't get enough  
    oxygen when he was born.    

20:20.920 --> 20:22.786
Now, that's what happened       
        to George.              

20:22.788 --> 20:26.423
      What's your excuse?       

20:26.425 --> 20:28.826
