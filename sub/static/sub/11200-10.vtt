WEBVTT

00:02.068 --> 00:04.263
NARRATOR: Previously, on Stargate SG-1.

00:04.371 --> 00:06.771
What say you to the promise of the Ori?

00:06.873 --> 00:09.341
We will hear no more of false gods.

00:09.442 --> 00:13.469
MAN: So we had to make a choice:
Follow the Ori, or be destroyed.

00:13.580 --> 00:16.105
In moments, our city was Ieveled.

00:16.449 --> 00:18.713
If a Prior visits your world,

00:20.086 --> 00:21.314
Ieave.

00:21.421 --> 00:24.822
Is great knowledge,
power, understanding,

00:25.158 --> 00:27.956
not enough for you to revere the Ori?

00:28.061 --> 00:30.621
That doesn't mean I would murder
innocent people in their name.

00:30.730 --> 00:32.163
LANDRY: If we don't continue
to work together,

00:32.265 --> 00:34.893
the victory that we worked
so long and hard for

00:35.001 --> 00:36.901
could result in chaos.

00:37.037 --> 00:40.871
My name is Orlin.
I'm from the planet you just visited.

00:41.608 --> 00:44.668
Actually, the truth is I Iove you.

00:45.178 --> 00:46.543
Oh, my God.

00:50.517 --> 00:51.984
MITCHELL: I'm just saying it's pure ego.

00:52.085 --> 00:54.383
Pure ego? I don't know.
At that level of enlightenment?

00:54.487 --> 00:56.011
I mean, arrogance is about pleasure, right?

00:56.122 --> 00:58.682
Wallowing in the pride
of one's achievements.

00:58.925 --> 01:02.361
Well, you don't think that getting
a whole galaxy to bow down

01:02.462 --> 01:03.986
and worship you
is something to write home about?

01:04.097 --> 01:05.724
No, I'm just saying
that the ascended beings I've met

01:05.832 --> 01:07.493
have pretty much all the satisfaction
anyone can need.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.431
They don't need to lord it over us.

01:09.536 --> 01:11.868
They kind of look at us the way
we look at bugs,

01:11.972 --> 01:13.132
insignificant, amusing, at best.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.969
Yeah, no, look,
I get what you're saying, but...

01:16.076 --> 01:17.065
(SNIFFS)

01:17.177 --> 01:18.303
Damn.

01:18.979 --> 01:21.846
-That smell, is that you?
-Nope, uh-uh. Don't think so.

01:21.948 --> 01:25.645
Oh, Barnes! Right. Of course.
I should have known that stench was you.

01:25.752 --> 01:29.779
Very funny, Mitchell.
We've been undercover on P2X-885.

01:29.889 --> 01:32.790
10,000 poverty-stricken peasants,
only one fresh-water well.

01:32.892 --> 01:35.360
Not to mention 130 degrees in the shade.

01:35.462 --> 01:38.260
Well, you might want to think about
taking a shower before you debrief Landry.

01:38.365 --> 01:40.424
-Right after Lam clears us.
-Yeah, lucky her.

01:40.533 --> 01:43.297
Maybe if we're lucky
she'll give us all a sponge bath.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.996
I wouldn't repeat that around
the General, Lieutenant.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.266
I wouldn't repeat that around me.

01:48.875 --> 01:50.069
Sorry, sir.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.479
Let's go.

01:58.485 --> 02:00.510
Okay, seriously, what's his problem?

02:00.620 --> 02:03.612
Aside from the fact that's
a completely inappropriate comment,

02:03.723 --> 02:05.714
Lam is Landry's daughter.

02:06.159 --> 02:07.956
-Sir, I'm sorry.
-Know when to shut up, Lieutenant.

02:08.061 --> 02:10.962
MlTCHELL: Hey, Colonel.
How'd it go, by the way?

02:11.731 --> 02:14.291
Not good. 885's gone Ori.

02:18.405 --> 02:20.168
Third planet this month.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.681
GERAK: I asked not to be disturbed.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.945
Forgive me, but he is here.

02:43.129 --> 02:44.494
Greetings.

02:47.934 --> 02:50.596
Have you contemplated your destiny?

02:50.837 --> 02:54.933
I have read from the book
and I find it to be most illuminating.

02:55.608 --> 02:57.473
Antares and the river.

02:58.044 --> 03:01.480
How the people of the low valley
were freed from the yoke

03:01.581 --> 03:05.415
of an iron serpent who ruled over them
without mercy.

03:06.453 --> 03:09.183
Do you see this
as more than mere coincidence?

03:10.156 --> 03:11.953
You suggest it is prophecy?

03:12.058 --> 03:14.891
Such is the wisdom
granted by true enlightenment

03:14.994 --> 03:17.258
and the road we all must take.

03:17.363 --> 03:21.993
Many Jaffa are without faith and direction,

03:22.769 --> 03:26.227
hurt by the lies and betrayal
of those who have enslaved us.

03:26.372 --> 03:29.773
You have been burned by evil,
but do not let that keep you

03:29.876 --> 03:33.073
from the warmth and light
of the eternal flame.

03:33.313 --> 03:35.508
Let Origin show you the way.

03:35.715 --> 03:40.652
I'm merely saying
that it may still take some time

03:41.621 --> 03:45.648
for other Jaffa to see Origin
as I have come to see it.

03:48.428 --> 03:54.025
But I vow to spread the word of the Ori
to all Jaffa.

03:56.002 --> 03:58.368
Hallowed are the Ori.

03:58.471 --> 04:00.837
Hallowed are the Ori.

05:13.713 --> 05:16.546
-Colonel Carter, I've read your proposal.
-And?

05:16.649 --> 05:19.914
And I'm not exactly sure
what an aneurysm feels like,

05:20.019 --> 05:21.646
but I suspect I'm pretty close.

05:21.788 --> 05:25.246
-Boy, I'm glad I'm not the only one.
-Can you put this in layman's terms?

05:25.358 --> 05:28.327
Well, simply speaking, sir,
based on the research that was done

05:28.428 --> 05:30.362
on Anubis' genetic experiment, Khalek,

05:30.463 --> 05:32.795
we believe we may be close
to developing a technology

05:32.899 --> 05:34.833
that could inhibit a Prior's special abilities.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.559
Are we talking about
an anti-Prior gun here?

05:37.670 --> 05:40.764
Because I don't remember seeing
the word "gun" anywhere in here.

05:40.873 --> 05:42.306
Well, it wouldn't be a gun, exactly,

05:42.408 --> 05:44.569
but that is kind of what made us think
it was possible.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.510
Because I was able to shoot Khalek
while he was focused on defending himself

05:47.614 --> 05:48.706
from you.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.282
CARTER: Which meant
he wasn't omnipotent.

05:50.383 --> 05:52.078
You think the Priors are the same?

05:52.185 --> 05:54.949
We've identified specific portions
of the brain that were active

05:55.054 --> 05:56.851
when Khalek was using
his unique abilities.

05:56.956 --> 05:59.390
Now, he had those abilities because he
was at a much more evolved state,

05:59.492 --> 06:00.481
very close to Ascension.

06:00.593 --> 06:03.528
Now we're hoping the Ori are affecting
the Priors in much the same way.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.190
Dr. Lee and I are working on a way
of targeting and neutralizing

06:06.299 --> 06:08.597
those higher brain functions
using a field generator

06:08.701 --> 06:11.135
emitting fluctuating
ultrasonic frequencies.

06:11.237 --> 06:13.569
And my headache was just going away.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.998
I don't wanna sound overly optimistic, sir,

06:16.276 --> 06:19.109
but I think we may be close
to testing within a couple of days.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.213
I would like to report
that something positive

06:21.314 --> 06:23.714
-came out of that whole Khalek situation.
-Yes, sir.

06:23.816 --> 06:25.113
Keep me posted.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.718
-He didn't look too impressed.
-Oh, trust me,

06:32.825 --> 06:35.453
anti-Prior gun
would have gone down better.

06:41.701 --> 06:45.159
If the Jaffa at Kallana had heeded
the wisdom of the Priors,

06:45.271 --> 06:46.636
they'd all still be alive today.

06:46.739 --> 06:51.438
The Jaffa at Kallana were defending
themselves against a military incursion.

06:52.011 --> 06:54.479
The Ori were attempting
to construct a means

06:54.580 --> 06:57.640
by which to invade our galaxy
and attack us.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.981
They offered us the wisdom of the ages
and everlasting life,

07:01.087 --> 07:02.748
and we met that with force.

07:02.855 --> 07:05.119
Were their actions not justified?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.727
Thousands of lives were lost.

07:08.961 --> 07:11.020
All the more reason
why we should respect their power.

07:11.130 --> 07:14.258
If you are suggesting
we have no other choice but to acquiesce,

07:14.367 --> 07:15.994
that would be cowardice.

07:16.769 --> 07:17.861
TEAL'C: Gerak.

07:24.844 --> 07:27.312
I believe their intentions are pure.

07:27.980 --> 07:31.609
They offer us enlightenment,
knowledge, salvation.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.754
All of these things can be ours

07:35.855 --> 07:40.792
if we have the courage
to embrace our destiny.

07:43.930 --> 07:46.228
I believe a recess is in order.

07:46.366 --> 07:49.494
The Council will deliberate
on Gerak's proposal.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.145
I came as soon as I heard.

08:10.857 --> 08:12.290
(SIGHING)

08:14.260 --> 08:19.027
Gerak has proposed that the religion of
the Ori should be adopted by all Jaffa.

08:19.298 --> 08:20.663
As law?

08:21.167 --> 08:23.032
To be taught to our children,

08:23.236 --> 08:26.728
its benedictions and traditions
followed to the letter.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.202
Should it be ratified by the Council,

08:29.308 --> 08:33.142
all Jaffa would have no choice
but to accept the Ori as gods.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.214
True belief cannot be legislated.

08:35.314 --> 08:37.908
Surely the Council must know
this is beyond their purview.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.985
But Gerak seems to have swayed many.

08:40.420 --> 08:43.412
He is convinced that the Ori
represent the true gods

08:43.523 --> 08:47.152
we have all sought for generations,
and that only by worshipping them

08:47.260 --> 08:50.491
can we finally find
peace and enlightenment.

08:50.596 --> 08:53.429
Then he is a fool
and must be revealed as such.

08:53.533 --> 08:57.492
Gerak is many things,
but he's no fool, Teal'c.

08:59.105 --> 09:03.098
Because of us, too many Jaffa now know
that the Ancients of this galaxy

09:03.209 --> 09:05.643
will never offer us
a quick path to Ascension.

09:06.946 --> 09:10.746
-Still, the Ori are not the answer.
-No,

09:11.784 --> 09:15.311
but Gerak is old,
as are many of the Council.

09:15.655 --> 09:20.149
For them, the Ori represent hope for life
beyond that which we now know.

09:20.259 --> 09:23.695
For that reason alone,
this proposal will carry weight.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.066
A couple of days?

09:34.240 --> 09:37.641
We'll just have to roll up our sleeves
and burn some midnight oil if we have to.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.142
Oh, midnight oil.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.542
Why didn't you just tell him
we'd come up with

09:40.646 --> 09:43.615
a viable means of creating cold fusion
while you were at it?

09:43.850 --> 09:45.442
Sure, if you've got something.

09:45.551 --> 09:46.518
(LAUGHING)

09:46.652 --> 09:51.146
Look, I mean, all we have is a bunch
of uncorrelated data and a theory.

09:51.257 --> 09:55.318
Yeah, I mean,
I admit it's a pretty sound theory,

09:55.428 --> 09:57.089
(LAUGHING) if you'll pardon the pun.

10:00.366 --> 10:04.029
Ultrasonic waves. That's good.

10:04.136 --> 10:07.299
Anyway, I mean, it's gonna be
a matter of months before we get it...

10:08.274 --> 10:11.766
Oh, I see. I understand.

10:11.878 --> 10:14.244
This is your first project
back from Area 51,

10:14.347 --> 10:16.747
and you just wanna
impress everybody, right?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.985
Can you hear me?

10:23.756 --> 10:24.882
What?

10:27.026 --> 10:28.425
(STUTTERING) No... Right.

10:29.595 --> 10:33.691
Sleeves up and working.

10:42.408 --> 10:43.432
LAM: It's Colonel Barnes.

10:43.543 --> 10:44.510
(HEART MONITOR BEEPING)

10:44.610 --> 10:46.942
About three hours ago,
he came in complaining of fatigue.

10:47.046 --> 10:49.708
About an hour after that
he could barely stand.

10:50.016 --> 10:53.747
High fever, chest pain,
respiratory distress. Sound familiar?

10:53.853 --> 10:55.218
You're certain it's the same?

10:55.354 --> 10:59.950
He's displaying identical symptoms
as the people who were infected on 412.

11:00.192 --> 11:01.557
It's a Prior plague.

11:04.463 --> 11:07.330
We have to find Lieutenant Fischer,
and fast.

11:08.434 --> 11:09.992
GENERAL HAMMOND:
In my many years of service,

11:10.102 --> 11:13.936
I've met with our men and women
in uniform around the world.

11:14.040 --> 11:18.636
Active, guard and reserve, those on
the front Iines and those here at home.

11:19.512 --> 11:23.471
And then, as now,
I am continually amazed

11:23.583 --> 11:27.542
by your courage,
dedication and patriotism.

11:27.753 --> 11:31.314
Our airmen, soldiers, sailors and marines

11:31.424 --> 11:37.329
are symbols of the pride and strength
of this nation.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.531
Be proud of what you do.

11:41.200 --> 11:45.261
You make our nation stronger
and our world safer.

11:46.138 --> 11:47.298
Thank you.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.342
(CAR TIRES SCREECHING)

12:25.378 --> 12:26.675
WOMAN: What's going on?

12:30.416 --> 12:31.883
MAN: Come on, sir.

12:33.452 --> 12:34.976
SOLDIER: Back away, back away.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.714
-Lieutenant Fischer?
-Yes, sir.

12:36.822 --> 12:38.847
You're gonna have to
come with me immediately.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.185
Come on, back away. In here, please.

12:49.335 --> 12:52.236
LANDRY: You cleared SG-6
when they returned from 885.

12:52.338 --> 12:53.737
I approved their clearance, yes.

12:53.839 --> 12:56.831
We've been taking extra precautions
since the outbreak on 412,

12:56.942 --> 12:59.843
but you can't test for a virus
that you don't know exists.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.936
This strain has a completely different
genetic makeup,

13:02.048 --> 13:05.108
and what's worse, it seems to be mutating
right before our eyes.

13:05.217 --> 13:06.309
Sir!

13:06.419 --> 13:07.909
They found Fischer.
They're bringing him in.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.215
And everyone at the speech
has been quarantined.

13:10.322 --> 13:13.780
Barnes says he thinks Fischer was the one
who made direct contact with the Prior.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.952
Airman Ryan is showing early symptoms.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.223
Lieutenant Brooks
has been quarantined as well.

13:18.330 --> 13:19.957
Sir, we have no way of knowing

13:20.066 --> 13:22.626
who Fischer may have come
in contact with prior to leaving this base,

13:22.735 --> 13:24.327
or how far this thing has spread.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.268
FlSCHER: It was a couple of days
before we left the planet.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.040
Airman Ryan
and I went to morning prostration.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.082
The Prior was there, preaching.

13:39.185 --> 13:41.119
You had no idea
your cover had been blown?

13:41.220 --> 13:42.847
No, sir. There was no way

13:42.955 --> 13:45.822
anybody from that planet
could have known we were from Earth.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.721
The Prior walked among us,
touching people on the head

13:48.828 --> 13:51.524
-as some sort ofbenediction.
-Wait, wait, wait. He touched...

13:52.131 --> 13:54.224
Sorry, he touched you on your head?

13:54.333 --> 13:55.300
(SIGHING)

13:55.801 --> 13:58.326
I'm sorry, sir.
IfI'd realized it was so important

13:58.437 --> 14:00.200
I would have put it in my report.

14:00.439 --> 14:02.304
That's all right, Lieutenant. Thank you.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.238
So how come he isn't sick?

14:05.344 --> 14:07.938
I'm guessing it's because
he's just a carrier.

14:08.047 --> 14:11.608
If he got sick and died from the virus,
it wouldn't spread very far, would it?

14:11.717 --> 14:12.843
(DOOR OPENING)

Colonel, Dr. Lam. A word.

14:19.091 --> 14:21.958
-LANDRY: What have you got?
-He's definitely patient zero.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.386
The team on sight at Peterson
just reported

14:25.498 --> 14:28.592
that two of the people in the crowd
at General Hammond's speech

14:28.701 --> 14:31.261
are displaying symptoms
and have tested positive.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.565
-The General himself is fine.
-That's good, sir.

14:33.672 --> 14:37.438
What about the restaurant and gas station
Fischer stopped at on his way into town?

14:37.543 --> 14:40.944
The CDC has mobilized units
to try and contain the situation.

14:41.046 --> 14:44.846
They've sent out bulletins to every
hospital and medical facility in the state.

14:44.950 --> 14:48.386
Anyone showing plague symptoms
will be referred to us.

14:48.487 --> 14:51.456
-Do we have a cover story?
-A new influenza that first appeared

14:51.557 --> 14:53.752
at St. Francis Medical Centre
two days ago.

14:53.859 --> 14:56.487
We're issuing a press release in an hour.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.629
Colonel, I'd like you in the field,

14:58.731 --> 15:01.359
following up on
Lieutenant Fischer's activities,

15:01.467 --> 15:02.134
-just to be sure.
-Yes, sir.

15:02.134 --> 15:03.158
-just to be sure.
-Yes, sir.

15:03.302 --> 15:06.237
You'll have to get scrubbed
and stay in hazmat on the outside.

15:06.539 --> 15:07.528
Yes, ma'am.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.972
Twelve infected base personnel
have been quarantined.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.474
Four of them are showing early symptoms.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.307
Now, half of those people came in
direct physical contact with SG-6

15:14.413 --> 15:15.744
after they came back.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.316
However, the rest of them didn't,
which means we should assume

15:18.417 --> 15:20.544
-the worst-case scenario.
-Which is?

15:20.786 --> 15:23.311
The virus may be airborne and persistent.

15:23.489 --> 15:26.856
So we have no idea how many people
this will ultimately affect.

of the situation.

15:49.448 --> 15:52.212
-May I be of any assistance?
-Not at the moment.

15:52.318 --> 15:56.084
We've restricted gate travel in and out
of the base for the time being.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.413
-Understood.
-How did it go with the Council?

15:58.524 --> 16:00.856
-Have they made a decision?
-They have not.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.259
But I have been told they are Ieaning
towards accepting Gerak's proposal

16:04.363 --> 16:07.059
-despite our warnings.
-Doesn't sound good.

16:07.166 --> 16:11.000
Bra 'tac and I no Ionger believe this battle
can be won through diplomacy alone.

16:11.103 --> 16:13.663
The Council must know of our resolve
by other means.

16:13.772 --> 16:15.069
Such as?

16:15.341 --> 16:17.741
We will tra vel to Chulak
to meet with other Jaffa Ieaders

16:17.843 --> 16:19.367
who feel as we do.

16:19.478 --> 16:23.107
No matter what the Council decides,
we will resist any alliance with the Ori.

16:23.215 --> 16:26.776
So your fight for freedom may end up
in an all-out civil war?

16:28.387 --> 16:31.652
-Indeed.
-Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.102
MITCHELL: It's a self-serve station, sir.

16:45.604 --> 16:49.700
According to receipts, 22 people
have used the pump that Fischer used.

16:50.142 --> 16:54.044
We're tracking down the folks
that used credit cards, but six used cash.

16:54.146 --> 16:57.445
We've called in the National Guard.
I'm staying in touch with the Governor,

16:57.549 --> 17:00.746
but it looks like we may need
to close down the state, Colonel.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.320
MITCHELL: Yes, sir. It's pretty bad.

17:02.488 --> 17:07.050

17:46.298 --> 17:48.266
-How's it coming?
-Not well.

17:48.367 --> 17:52.303
I mean, we all know our auditory senses
are a direct line to certain brain functions,

17:52.404 --> 17:55.305
and we know they respond differently
to different sonic frequencies,

17:55.407 --> 17:59.275
but, you know,
trying to achieve something as specific

17:59.378 --> 18:02.745
as isolating one small part of the brain,
that's like...

18:03.582 --> 18:09.043
I mean, it's like trying to do something

18:09.154 --> 18:12.055
that's impossible.

As far as I can tell,
he's a normal human adolescent.

20:39.338 --> 20:43.468
Who claims he's an Ancient who has
descended and taken human form.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.571
There really is no other explanation, sir,

20:45.677 --> 20:48.373
for how he could've gotten into the base
or know the things he knows.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.745
I'm pretty sure he's given us the key
to finishing the anti-Prior technology

20:51.850 --> 20:53.442

20:53.552 --> 20:57.318
According to the mission report
on your first encounter with Orlin,

20:57.422 --> 21:01.916
you two had an intimate relationship?

21:03.562 --> 21:08.022
Well, we did, but he didn't look like that.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.095
-He was...
-Taller?

21:12.171 --> 21:13.763
He was a grown man.

21:15.007 --> 21:18.909
-So why come back as a boy this time?
-CARTER: He said he had no choice, sir.

21:19.311 --> 21:21.370
He had to take a younger form
in order to preserve

21:21.480 --> 21:23.277
as many of the Ancient memories
as possible.

21:23.382 --> 21:25.077
The knowledge he possessed
as an ascended being

21:25.184 --> 21:26.913
was too massive
for a normal human brain to handle.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.782
We're guessing that
having a younger brain gave him

21:28.887 --> 21:31.219
a slightly better chance
of retaining the knowledge a little longer.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.018
That makes sense, actually.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.717
The normal makeup
of a still-developing mind

21:34.826 --> 21:37.556
has a potential for better
memory retention than that of an adult.

21:37.863 --> 21:40.798
Ultimately, sir, he says
he will lose most of the knowledge.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.466
Sir, I think he's taken a huge risk
just to be here.

21:44.603 --> 21:46.298
We should at least hear him out.

21:46.438 --> 21:47.405
Mmm-hmm.

21:51.043 --> 21:54.137
I'm sorry, aren't you breaking
some major cosmic rules here?

21:54.246 --> 21:58.012
I mean, why did the others let you go
without wiping your memory clean?

21:59.651 --> 22:01.585
Honestly, I don't really know.

22:01.753 --> 22:03.983
I guess enough of them
felt it was necessary

22:04.089 --> 22:06.489
for someone to step out of line
and warn you.

22:06.592 --> 22:08.924
I'm assuming you're talking about
the Ori.

22:09.027 --> 22:12.121
We're already aware of the threat
they pose.

22:12.364 --> 22:14.764
Believe me, you don't know everything.

22:15.801 --> 22:19.237
A long time ago, the Ori
and the Alterans were one society,

22:19.338 --> 22:22.466
human, on an evolutionary path
to Ascension,

22:22.741 --> 22:25.073
but a philosophical division grew.

22:25.244 --> 22:28.805
The Ori grew more and more fervent
in their religious belief.

22:29.047 --> 22:33.814
The Alterans, for lack of a better way
of putting it, believed in science.

22:34.753 --> 22:36.482
The Ori tried to wipe them out.

22:36.588 --> 22:38.715
JACKSON: So, instead of going to war,
the Alterans built a ship,

22:38.824 --> 22:40.485
Ieft their galaxy and came here.

22:40.592 --> 22:42.822
We know that both the Alterans
and the Ori eventually ascended,

22:42.961 --> 22:44.929
and that the Ori passed on a religion
called Origin

22:45.030 --> 22:46.725
to the next evolution of humans
they created.

22:46.832 --> 22:50.393
Yes, but the central promise
of the religion,

22:50.569 --> 22:53.936
everything Origin's followers
devote themselves to, is a lie.

22:58.043 --> 23:01.479
Are you saying that the Ori don't offer
their followers Ascension?

23:01.580 --> 23:04.708
No, most certainly not.
Then they'd have to share.

23:04.816 --> 23:05.976
Share what?

23:06.151 --> 23:08.551
The power they sap
from those who worship them.

23:08.754 --> 23:10.483
How is that possible?

23:11.523 --> 23:14.822
Are you saying there's a real physical
transfer of energy to the Ori

23:14.926 --> 23:17.190
that occurs simply through
a human being's belief in them?

23:17.296 --> 23:21.630
"Simply" is not how I would put it.
It's quite complicated, but possible.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.633
And for it to have a measurable effect,

23:23.735 --> 23:27.227
it requires massive numbers of humans
relinquishing their will.

23:27.839 --> 23:32.469
Nevertheless, it is one of the main reasons
the Ancients have so strongly believed

23:32.577 --> 23:35.239
in strict non-interference
in the lower planes.

23:35.347 --> 23:38.145
Because the temptation to manipulate
and align lower life forms in some order

23:38.250 --> 23:41.583
for your own purposes could result
in exactly this type of abusive corruption.

23:41.687 --> 23:44.679
The Ori empower themselves
by sapping the life force

23:44.790 --> 23:47.452
of those willing
to surrender themselves to them.

23:47.559 --> 23:48.685
JACKSON: Unknowingly.

23:48.794 --> 23:50.955
And this promise of salvation in return...

23:51.063 --> 23:54.123
Leads to nothing
but death of the most meaningless kind.

23:54.232 --> 23:57.167
Because there's no conscious effort
to achieve enlightenment

23:57.269 --> 23:59.032
without being spoon-fed by the Ori.

23:59.137 --> 24:02.197
Do the Priors know this?
I mean, are they complicit?

24:02.307 --> 24:04.537
No, they are merely pawns.

24:04.843 --> 24:09.678
The more worlds the Priors convert,
the more powerful the Ori become.

24:10.015 --> 24:11.573
They must be stopped.

24:11.683 --> 24:16.814
Why don't the Ancients, Alterans,
whatever you call yourselves now,

24:16.955 --> 24:20.118
-why don't you stop them?
-I'm one of them no longer.

24:20.225 --> 24:25.754
And even if I was, it is unclear whether
such action would result in victory.

24:25.864 --> 24:29.925
Nor is such an endeavor at that level
necessarily the next best step

24:30.035 --> 24:31.559
to further enlightenment.

24:31.670 --> 24:34.867
All I can say for sure is that
if this galaxy were to succumb

24:34.973 --> 24:37.999
and bow to the Ori,
it would be very bad for everyone.

24:49.454 --> 24:53.151
You have spread the word
of the Ori well, Gerak.

24:53.992 --> 24:57.393
I believe that their wisdom
was worthy of my efforts.

24:57.496 --> 25:01.899
And yet such wisdom
still falls upon deaf ears.

25:03.602 --> 25:06.537
A group of unbelievers, Jaffa

25:07.272 --> 25:10.435
who would stand against
your leadership and the Ori,

25:10.542 --> 25:13.340
are meeting, as we speak, on Chulak.

25:13.578 --> 25:16.274
The true belief
cannot be forced upon others.

25:17.616 --> 25:20.744
The offering of Origin speaks for itself.

25:23.088 --> 25:28.048
I believe that, in time, they will come
to believe that this is true.

25:28.393 --> 25:32.420
As you have said,
the Jaffa are strong-willed.

25:33.532 --> 25:38.469
You are a people that understands
the nobility of bloodshed,

25:38.637 --> 25:41.367
the necessity of sacrifice.

25:42.641 --> 25:44.575
What would you have me do?

25:44.709 --> 25:51.171
Go to Chulak, mark it as the last place
a Jaffa will ever defy the power of the Ori,

25:51.349 --> 25:55.786
and destroy all those who will not
walk the path to enlightenment.

25:59.458 --> 26:03.588
We're hoping that as long as you're here,
you may be able to help us.

26:04.529 --> 26:07.521
ORLlN: I no longer possess the power
to simply cure this plague

26:07.632 --> 26:09.862
as I could have as an ascended being.

26:09.968 --> 26:12.129
However, with the knowledge I still retain

26:12.237 --> 26:16.367
I believe I can synthesize a cure
using your medical technology.

26:16.741 --> 26:20.939
You built a stargate in my basement
with spare parts from a toaster.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.506
Actually, this will be
a little harder than that.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.489
Gerak,

26:41.566 --> 26:44.660
the battle at Kallana, I lost a cousin there.

26:46.371 --> 26:48.396
Their deaths still haunt me today.

26:50.041 --> 26:52.407
But it does not cause me
to doubt my decision.

26:54.846 --> 26:57.371
I have read from the Book of Origin,

26:57.582 --> 27:00.574
searched for the wisdom
you speak so highly of,

27:00.685 --> 27:05.019
and I do see fables meant to fill
a soul bereft of hope with purpose.

27:05.423 --> 27:08.915
-Stories of morality and righteousness.
-And this is not worthy of your respect?

27:09.060 --> 27:11.528
So are the traditions of the Jaffa.

27:11.763 --> 27:13.890
Are we just supposed to abandon
all that we are?

27:13.999 --> 27:15.057
No!

27:18.436 --> 27:21.337
But if you are to look real close,

27:21.439 --> 27:24.966
you'll find that everything that we want
is in here.

27:25.076 --> 27:28.603
Everything that we've ever desired
is in here.

27:47.866 --> 27:49.299
CARTER: How's it going?

27:49.601 --> 27:51.728
Basically, I know what I need to make,

27:51.836 --> 27:54.930
I just don't have any of the right materials
or tools.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.003
This is the best we have.

27:58.643 --> 28:02.272
-I can get you a toaster if you need it.
-Not unless you're hungry for toast.

28:03.548 --> 28:04.416
Waffle iron?

28:04.416 --> 28:05.041
Waffle iron?

28:06.384 --> 28:09.353
Look, I hate to be pushy, but do you
ha ve any kind of time frame on this?

28:09.454 --> 28:11.183
Honestly, time from your perspective

28:11.289 --> 28:13.348
is not something
I'm all that used to dealing with.

28:14.926 --> 28:17.360
-Is there anything I can do?
-You can keep me company.

28:18.430 --> 28:19.624
Right.

28:20.231 --> 28:21.755
WOMAN ON T.V. :
Hospitals are struggling to cope

28:21.866 --> 28:22.958
with an influx ofpeople who suspect...

28:23.068 --> 28:25.298
HARRlMAN: Sir, I have Colonel Mitchell
on the line for you.

28:25.403 --> 28:28.463
...contracted the virus.
As a result, crowded waiting rooms

28:28.573 --> 28:32.270
are now serving only to exacerbate
an already difficult...

28:32.377 --> 28:34.971
Put him on speaker.
What have you got, Colonel?

28:37.349 --> 28:39.180
Sir, we have a problem.

28:39.317 --> 28:41.785
Looks like one of the people
who used the gas pump Fischer touched

28:41.920 --> 28:45.185
got onto a plane
before the quarantine went into effect.

28:45.290 --> 28:46.587
LANDRY: To where?

28:47.659 --> 28:51.356
It's bad. He caught a flight to Denver,

28:51.529 --> 28:53.759
with connections to Chicago
and New York.

28:53.898 --> 28:57.026
Sir, I'm afraid we've Iost control
of the situation.

28:57.602 --> 28:58.933
(SIGHING)

29:03.541 --> 29:07.944
I have to admit it's nice being out
of that uncomfortable suit for a while.

29:08.046 --> 29:10.640
I know I'm vulnerable now as a human,

29:10.749 --> 29:14.082
yet, I still can't quite get my head around
my own frailty.

29:14.185 --> 29:17.484
Well, you've been at it
nearly nine hours straight.

29:17.689 --> 29:20.658
-You need something to eat.
-I am hungry.

29:21.493 --> 29:26.328
Maybe it's just me. It has been a while
since I experienced human senses,

29:26.431 --> 29:29.025
but this food doesn't smell very good.

29:29.134 --> 29:30.999
That's because it's not very good.

29:35.273 --> 29:38.401
I remember eating pretty well
the last time I did this.

29:40.378 --> 29:42.778
This is a one-way trip for you this time,
isn't it?

29:43.014 --> 29:45.778
The others, they're not gonna help you
ascend again, are they?

29:45.917 --> 29:47.441
I don't think so.

29:50.655 --> 29:53.886
I know it must be kind of weird,
my appearing this young.

29:54.225 --> 29:56.489
A little, but I understand.

29:58.063 --> 30:01.430
My only regret in all this
is that human social conventions

30:01.533 --> 30:04.001
preclude us from showing affection
the way I wish I could.

30:07.038 --> 30:08.505
Excuse me?

30:08.773 --> 30:12.573
My feelings haven't changed for you
since we last saw each other, Sam.

30:12.677 --> 30:14.508
Maybe in a few years...

30:14.779 --> 30:17.509
It's okay.
We don't need to talk about it any further.

30:17.615 --> 30:23.019
I just wanted you to know that taking
human form at this age, while necessary,

30:23.321 --> 30:27.951
didn't come easy, because of how I knew
I would feel being here with you again.

30:33.932 --> 30:36.901
Is it me, or is this food not very good?

30:37.535 --> 30:39.935
-Are you making a joke?
-No.

30:40.138 --> 30:44.268
It has been a while since I tasted food,
but this seems terrible.

30:45.243 --> 30:48.679
-We just talked about that.
-Oh, right, I'm sorry.

30:48.780 --> 30:51.408
I'm used to hearing my own thoughts
in my mind,

30:51.516 --> 30:55.418
and sometimes it's hard to distinguish
which ones I say out loud.

30:57.555 --> 31:01.286
-Did I tell you I still have feelings for you?
-Yes, thank you.

31:01.559 --> 31:03.151
Yeah, we don't need to go into that again.

31:03.261 --> 31:04.353
(CHUCKLING)

31:13.104 --> 31:14.799
5,000 confirmed cases of infection.

31:14.906 --> 31:17.204
Now, the bulk of those are from
the Colorado Springs and Denver areas.

31:17.308 --> 31:18.900
LANDRY: What about New York
and Chicago?

31:19.010 --> 31:22.605
45 new cases have been reported in Utah,
36 in New York, 20 in Chicago,

31:22.714 --> 31:24.045
and now 20 in San Diego.

31:24.149 --> 31:27.118
-The country is in a panic.
-President's preparing an address.

31:27.218 --> 31:29.482
What the hell happened
at JFK and Salt Lake?

31:29.587 --> 31:33.079
The CDC had the manifest
and the names of the flight crew.

31:33.191 --> 31:35.455
And because we moved fast,
most of the passengers were quarantined.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.084
A few still remain unaccounted for.

31:37.195 --> 31:39.254
They're doing the best they can
to track them down now.

31:39.364 --> 31:42.663
We're now hearing about cases
in new locations

31:43.067 --> 31:45.365
every hour now as opposed
to three or four a day.

31:45.470 --> 31:48.769
-What about casualties?
-There are only eight people dead so far.

31:48.873 --> 31:51.068
-Five of them are SGC personnel.
-So far?

31:51.176 --> 31:53.940
I say "so far" because
of the reasonably long incubation period.

31:54.045 --> 31:56.411
Again, this virus was designed
to avoid detection

31:56.514 --> 31:58.482
and for maximum spreading capability.

31:58.583 --> 32:02.349
And we know it's deadly.
So with over 5,000 people infected

32:02.453 --> 32:04.614
and no effective treatment as of yet,

32:04.722 --> 32:07.850
that number of casualties will climb
very quickly, very soon.

32:11.229 --> 32:15.290
Colonels, please tell me something good
is happening somewhere.

32:15.867 --> 32:18.893
Dr. Lee has finished
the anti-Prior prototype.

32:19.370 --> 32:22.601
-Of course, without a Prior on hand...
-lt does need to be field tested,

32:22.707 --> 32:24.334
but we think
we have a good reason to try it.

32:24.442 --> 32:26.876
-How's that?
-Orlin seems to have hit a dead end

32:26.978 --> 32:30.311
with his work on a cure.
He says there's a vital component missing.

32:30.415 --> 32:32.212
I told you, anything he needs.

32:32.317 --> 32:34.717
What he needs is a blood sample
from the Prior

32:34.819 --> 32:36.616
who infected Lieutenant Fischer.

32:37.155 --> 32:40.591
Orlin thinks the Prior
essentially manipulated his own DNA

32:40.692 --> 32:42.057
to create the virus.

32:42.160 --> 32:45.823
It's mutated several times since then,
but he still thinks having the root DNA

32:45.930 --> 32:47.397
that it was based on may help.

32:47.498 --> 32:51.798
You're talking about using an untested
technology to try and capture a Prior?

32:51.903 --> 32:55.930
No, not just any Prior.
The Prior who infected Fischer.

32:56.941 --> 32:59.432
It was our intel
from our friends on the Sodan planet

32:59.544 --> 33:01.068
who led us to 885 in the first place.

33:01.179 --> 33:04.171
Apparently, they're expecting
the same Prior back there tomorrow.

33:04.282 --> 33:06.113
And you're sure they can be trusted?

33:06.317 --> 33:10.310
As far as we know, the Sodan are the ones
who blew SG-6's cover.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.954
-I don't believe that, sir.
-Seems awful risky

33:14.058 --> 33:17.221
given that Orlin doesn't even sound
positive this will help him.

33:17.328 --> 33:20.354
Orlin's attempt to find a cure might
not be the only reason to do this.

33:20.465 --> 33:23.229
He thinks the Priors don't know
the truth about the Ori.

33:23.334 --> 33:26.167
Maybe if we enlighten them for a change...

33:27.205 --> 33:29.366
You wanna try and turn this Prior.

33:29.474 --> 33:31.965
Well, maybe not a complete 180,
but he might give us something,

33:32.076 --> 33:34.977
especially once he finds out
his gods aren't gonna ascend him.

33:35.079 --> 33:36.239
If he believes you.

33:36.347 --> 33:37.780
JACKSON: We won't know until we try, sir.

33:37.882 --> 33:40.373
In the meantime
we can at least get a blood sample.

33:43.554 --> 33:47.320
So how does it work?
Assuming it actually does work.

33:47.592 --> 33:49.719
(CHUCKLING) You know, I keep
telling myself that one of these days

33:49.827 --> 33:52.159
I'm gonna do something
that actually gets me a little respect...

33:52.263 --> 33:53.924
We're all waiting for that day, Bill.

33:55.166 --> 33:57.862
Theoretically, once activated,
the device will emit

33:57.969 --> 33:59.698
an omni-directional ultrasonic field.

33:59.804 --> 34:02.466
And that will prevent a Prior
from accessing

34:02.573 --> 34:05.770
the highly-evolved area of his brain
that gives him the super-human ability.

34:05.877 --> 34:09.540
Of course, we're presuming
that the staff weapons the Priors carry

34:09.647 --> 34:12.741
are also mentally activated
and will also be neutralized.

34:12.850 --> 34:16.081
While we're at it,
why don't we just assume that I can fly?

34:16.187 --> 34:17.984
Oh, actually,
I've been working on a theory...

34:18.089 --> 34:19.647
You said yourself it would be risky.

34:19.757 --> 34:22.692
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know I said that,
but the more I'm hearing,

34:22.794 --> 34:25.058
the more it's crossing over into crazy.

34:25.563 --> 34:28.464
Don't get me wrong, I like crazy.
That's why I asked for this job.

34:28.766 --> 34:32.930
One more thing. There's a range of
frequencies programmed into the emitter.

34:33.037 --> 34:35.835
If one doesn't work at first, try the others.

34:46.718 --> 34:48.913
Even if the Kal'jok region commits
to our cause,

34:49.020 --> 34:51.614
we will still be outnumbered
in ships and armies.

34:53.091 --> 34:57.027
-Nearly six to one.
-Hopefully, no shots will ever be fired.

34:57.228 --> 34:59.492
Do you believe our mere willingness
to battle our brothers

34:59.597 --> 35:02.964
-will force the Council to hear us?
-The Council is lost.

35:03.601 --> 35:07.162
It is the hearts and minds of our brothers
and sisters that will take notice.

35:07.271 --> 35:10.001
They must be made aware
of the threat the Ori pose.

35:10.808 --> 35:12.241
(WHISPERING)

35:12.744 --> 35:15.235
If he is unarmed, let him enter.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.324
You are not welcome here.

35:28.459 --> 35:31.053
The powers of the Ori cannot be denied.

35:31.529 --> 35:34.532
I have come to beg you
to cease this madness or be destroyed.

35:34.532 --> 35:35.760
I have come to beg you
to cease this madness or be destroyed.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.228
By whose hand?

35:37.335 --> 35:39.860
My Ha'tak is in orbit above this planet.

35:39.971 --> 35:43.407
You would murder your brothers
and sisters, innocent children,

35:43.508 --> 35:47.171
-for choosing the life of a free Jaffa?
-You leave me no alternative.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.612
You have been warned.

36:08.566 --> 36:11.399
What are you doing?
I thought you were gonna get some rest.

36:11.702 --> 36:14.432
As soon as I finish
the DNA sequencing program.

36:14.539 --> 36:16.769
That way when we get the sample
from the Prior,

36:16.874 --> 36:20.571
we can plug in the decoded strand
and we'll know if it's going to help.

36:22.847 --> 36:26.305
-Orlin, you've already done it.
-What?

36:26.451 --> 36:28.681
The sequencing program.
You finished it a couple of hours ago.

36:28.786 --> 36:30.515
You were gonna get some rest.

36:30.755 --> 36:36.716
I was on my way,
and I felt like I had forgotten something.

36:37.528 --> 36:38.722
Orlin?

36:38.830 --> 36:39.797
(ORLIN SIGHING)

36:39.897 --> 36:40.864
It's okay.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.759
-I'm just tired.
-No, you're not.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.359
I want you to go see Dr. Lam.

36:47.105 --> 36:49.573
I think she has enough
to deal with right now.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.870
Orlin, you're our best hope
for finding a cure.

36:53.344 --> 36:55.312
We need you to be okay.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.888
I have them targeted. Shall I open fire?

37:15.166 --> 37:18.067
The only true darkness lives in the hearts

37:18.169 --> 37:21.104
of those who will not follow the path.

37:21.205 --> 37:24.641
Otherwise, there is always
some measure of light,

37:24.742 --> 37:30.237
and where there is light, the Ori see all.

37:32.884 --> 37:35.216
I spared their lives
because I believe they will soon see.

37:35.319 --> 37:37.184
You defied me!

37:37.455 --> 37:41.118
We do not serve the Ori at our whim.

37:41.225 --> 37:43.659
You cannot win the hearts of the Jaffa

37:43.761 --> 37:46.889
by needlessly spilling the blood
of the innocent.

37:46.998 --> 37:51.059
We are mere mortals.
We cannot begin to question

37:51.169 --> 37:54.798
those with the knowledge
and understanding of the infinite universe.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.101
If a few Jaffa must give their lives

37:57.208 --> 37:59.972
so that all Jaffa
from now until the end of time

38:00.077 --> 38:04.639
can find true enlightenment,
then who are you to stand in the way?

38:08.152 --> 38:09.449
Would you forgive me?

38:11.088 --> 38:14.182
Ask me not for forgiveness.

38:15.860 --> 38:18.090
I sense your doubt, Gerak,

38:19.964 --> 38:21.261
but fear not,

38:21.365 --> 38:25.859
the Ori do not require blind obedience.

38:26.604 --> 38:29.164
They will show you their power.

38:37.748 --> 38:39.010
Where are we?

38:39.317 --> 38:42.013
Your physical form remains on Dakara.

38:42.220 --> 38:44.780
The power of the Ori
has brought your mind here

38:44.889 --> 38:47.824
to Celestis, city of the gods.

38:51.362 --> 38:52.420
Come.

38:58.135 --> 39:00.160
(FIRE CRACKLING)

39:23.127 --> 39:25.823
Hallowed are the Ori.

39:32.703 --> 39:33.670
(LAUGHING)

39:34.071 --> 39:35.800
Relax, Jackson.

39:36.107 --> 39:39.406
I spent two weeks with these guys.
We got nothing to worry about.

39:39.510 --> 39:41.740
Well, considering what happened
the last time we were here,

39:41.846 --> 39:44.872
-you'll forgive me if I'm a little cautious.
-We'll be fine.

39:50.521 --> 39:51.488
(GROANS)

39:59.530 --> 40:01.998
-We still fine?
-Yeah, we're fine.

40:02.099 --> 40:03.657
Good, just checking.

40:04.135 --> 40:05.102
(PANTING)

40:07.204 --> 40:09.536
LAM: It's the most active scan
we've seen since Khalek.

40:09.640 --> 40:12.006
That device you brought back
from Anubis' genetic lab

40:12.109 --> 40:14.703
-shows his actual synaptic interaction.
-And?

40:14.812 --> 40:17.474
Looks like pockets of cells
are just shutting down.

40:17.581 --> 40:19.515
I can't say for certain,
but I can hazard a guess

40:19.617 --> 40:22.085
they're wearing out
from extremely unnatural overuse.

40:22.186 --> 40:24.484
Well, he said he would
lose the memories eventually.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.852
The human brain isn't meant
to hold that much information.

40:26.957 --> 40:28.549
This looks worse than that.

40:29.727 --> 40:31.786
It's like the cells are literally dying

40:31.896 --> 40:34.160
because they can't handle
all the synaptic activity.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.733
-What?
-Hey, this is way beyond my experience.

40:36.834 --> 40:40.031
-Still.
-(CLEARING THROAT) As you said,

40:40.371 --> 40:43.465
the human brain
wasn't supposed to be used this way.

40:45.509 --> 40:46.999
I don't know if it's conscious or not,

40:47.111 --> 40:50.103
but it's possible
he's trying to hold on to the knowledge.

40:50.214 --> 40:52.682
And holding on to that much knowledge
is causing brain damage?

41:05.529 --> 41:07.724
That's right.
Have him contact me as soon as he lands.

41:07.832 --> 41:10.392
We're tracking a new outbreak in Florida.

41:13.337 --> 41:14.634
-Walter.
-Sir.

41:14.739 --> 41:17.139
Just received a communiqué
from the White House.

41:19.810 --> 41:21.607
Can I have your attention, please?

41:21.712 --> 41:28.379
At last count, we have reports
of over 8,000 people infected in 13 states.

41:28.486 --> 41:32.286
As a result of these numbers,
as of 0800 this morning,

41:32.656 --> 41:36.319
the President has ordered that all borders
in the United States be closed

41:36.427 --> 41:37.826
until further notice.

41:38.262 --> 41:41.823
All inbound planes and ships
and other traffic

41:42.066 --> 41:45.399
will be ordered to divert
to alternate destinations.

41:46.137 --> 41:51.131
Our country is now
entirely under quarantine.

41:54.011 --> 41:55.979
You cannot ratify this proposal

41:56.080 --> 41:58.878
until all members of this council
have been heard from.

41:58.983 --> 42:02.214
-So far six...
-You merely seek to delay the inevitable!

42:02.319 --> 42:07.916
If and when all Jaffa wish to embrace
the Ori, then we shall act accordingly.

42:08.225 --> 42:11.251
If our brothers refuse to accept Origin
into their hearts,

42:11.362 --> 42:13.159
then they seal their own fate.

42:13.264 --> 42:17.223
We cannot turn our backs on our own
salvation because of indecisiveness.

42:17.334 --> 42:21.930
And they will see their way to the path.

42:32.583 --> 42:39.318
It is the destiny of all Jaffa
to follow Origin.
