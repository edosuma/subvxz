WELL, THANKS--
THANKS FOR COMING OVER.

00:17.867 --> 00:20.233

00:20.267 --> 00:22.367

BETTER IN YOUR LIFE.

00:24.300 --> 00:27.700
- OH, THANK YOU.

YOU'RE A BLESSED MAN.

00:27.733 --> 00:30.467
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I TOOK, UH--

00:30.500 --> 00:33.267
I TOOK CARE OF MYSELF.
I WAS NEVER AN ALCOHOLIC

00:33.300 --> 00:34.900
OR A DRUG ADDICT.

00:34.933 --> 00:37.733
NEVER SLEPT
WITH A LOT STRANGE WOMEN.
ALTHOUGH I WANTED TO,

00:37.767 --> 00:40.567
THEY WOULDN'T--
YOU KNOW...

00:40.600 --> 00:42.667
I NEED A KIDNEY, MAN.

00:42.700 --> 00:45.667
WHERE AM I GONNA FIND
SOMEONE WHO LOVES ME ENOUGH
JUST TO GIVE ME A KIDNEY?

00:45.700 --> 00:49.533
COME ON, YOU TOOK THE TEST.
YOU'RE A MATCH. ARE YOU GONNA
GIVE ME THE KIDNEY OR NOT?

00:49.567 --> 00:51.733
- I'M STRUGGLING.
- WELL, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH LOUIS LEWIS?

00:51.767 --> 00:53.133
- I MEAN, HE'S--
HE'S IN THIS...
- OH, PLEASE.

00:53.167 --> 00:55.500
COMA IN THE HOSPITAL.
HOW LONG CAN HE GO ON?

00:55.533 --> 00:58.133
- AND HE'S FAMILY.
- HE'S IN A COMA.

00:58.167 --> 01:00.133
COMAS ARE UNPREDICTABLE
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

01:00.167 --> 01:02.067
WHO THE HELL
FUCKING KNOWS?

01:02.067 --> 01:04.233
FAMILY.
FUCK FAMILY.

01:04.267 --> 01:07.667
YOU KNOW, AND YOU KNOW
WHAT'S PISSING ME OFF?
I'M SO LOW ON THAT LIST,

01:07.700 --> 01:10.700
THAT KIDNEY
TRANSPLANT LIST.
IT'S SO UNFAIR.

01:10.733 --> 01:13.200
LOOK AT THE MICK.
I MEAN, THE MICK--
I LOVE THE GUY,

01:13.233 --> 01:15.833

MANTLE GOT HIS LIVER
JUST LIKE THAT--

01:15.867 --> 01:17.233
- BOOM.
- YEAH. WELL,

01:17.267 --> 01:18.967
IF YOU WERE A LITTLE
BIGGER CELEBRITY,

01:19.067 --> 01:21.867
YOU'D BE ON THE TOP
OF THE LIST TOO.

01:21.900 --> 01:26.333
JESUS CHRIST.
BY THE WAY, THAT--
SEE THAT BALL?

01:26.367 --> 01:29.300

01:29.333 --> 01:31.367
YEAH, I'M LEAVING IT--
IT'S IN MY WILL.
IT'S YOURS.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.833
- NO KIDDING.

ABOUT 20 GRAND. I MEAN--

01:33.867 --> 01:35.200
- WHAT?!
- AND YOU GET THE MONEY TOO.

01:35.233 --> 01:37.067
I'M GIVING YOU THE BREAD
AND THE BALL.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.167
HEY.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.533
HEY, REMEMBER IN CAMP,
WHEN YOU USED TO DO--

01:42.567 --> 01:44.833

01:44.867 --> 01:46.733

01:50.067 --> 01:51.667
YEAH, THAT'S MANTLE.

01:51.700 --> 01:54.567
- WELL, I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.
- WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK?

01:54.600 --> 01:56.200
- YEAH, I'LL COME BACK.
- SOON?

01:56.233 --> 01:57.467
YEAH.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.400
AND LET ME
ASK YOU A QUESTION:
YOU LIKE THIS SWEATER?

02:00.433 --> 02:02.167
- HOW'S IT LOOK?
- YOU KNOW,

02:02.200 --> 02:04.400
IF YOU'RE DOING
AN ANDY WILLIAMS
SUMMER SHOW.

02:04.433 --> 02:07.100
( laughs )
SEE, YOU STILL GOT
YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR.

02:07.133 --> 02:10.767
- YOU STILL GOT IT.
- I LOVE YOU, LARRY.
I REALLY LOVE YOU.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.367
AND IF MY COUSIN
STAYS IN THAT COMA,

02:13.400 --> 02:15.433
I'M DEPENDING ON YOU.

02:16.833 --> 02:18.300
- Woman: HI.
- Larry: HI.

02:18.333 --> 02:21.700
- I'M LISA, HIS NURSE.
- OH, I'M LARRY.

02:21.733 --> 02:24.633
IT WAS NICE OF HIM
TO GIVE YOU HIS BALL
LIKE THAT.

02:24.667 --> 02:27.267
- THE BALL, YEAH--
THAT'S WAS VERY NICE.
- IT WAS VERY GOOD.

02:27.300 --> 02:30.467
- YEAH.
- HEY, I WANTED
TO TELL YOU, YOU KNOW?

02:30.500 --> 02:33.967

ACQUAINTANCE.
I KNOW JEFF.

02:34.067 --> 02:36.867
- YOU KNOW JEFF?
- I DO. YEAH YEAH.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.700
WE ACTUALLY DATED

02:38.733 --> 02:40.833
- REALLY?!
- YEAH, NOT TOO LONG.
BUT UH...

02:40.867 --> 02:43.200
- YEAH.
- WOW. SO DID YOU HAVE
A GOOD TIME WITH HIM?

02:43.233 --> 02:45.933
WELL, UNTIL THINGS GOT,
YOU KNOW, INTIMATE,

02:45.967 --> 02:47.600
IT WAS FUN.
YOU KNOW, HE'S--

02:47.633 --> 02:50.200
HE'S KIND OF A "SLAM,
BAM, THANK YOU, MA'AM"
KIND OF GUY, RIGHT?

02:50.233 --> 02:51.700
- NO, NOT REALLY AT ALL.
- NO?

02:51.733 --> 02:53.100
- OH!
- NO. NO SLAMMING,
NO BAMMING.

02:53.133 --> 02:56.067
- ( chuckles )
- NO THANKING THE MA'AM.

02:56.067 --> 02:58.067
HE'S WAS A LITTLE--
IT WAS SHORT LIVED,

02:58.100 --> 03:00.333
WAS THE PROBLEM.

03:00.367 --> 03:03.933
HE WAS LIKE THAT.

03:03.967 --> 03:06.633
I MEAN, IT WAS DARK,
BUT HONEST TO GOD

03:06.667 --> 03:08.733
IT WAS LIKE THAT.

03:08.767 --> 03:10.533
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

03:10.567 --> 03:12.667
UH, NO, I'M NOT
KIDDING.

03:12.700 --> 03:16.267
- JEFF?!
- YEAH, VERY SMALL,
VERY SMALL.

03:16.300 --> 03:17.900
- IT WAS LIKE A PEANUT.
THAT LITTLE--
- ALL RIGHT.

03:17.933 --> 03:21.067
THIS IS A VERY--
YOU KNOW, WAY TOO MUCH
INFORMATION HERE, OKAY?

03:21.100 --> 03:22.933
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW--
WOULD'VE KNOWN THAT.

03:22.967 --> 03:24.767
- HOW CAN I
KNOW SUCH A THING?
- I JUST WOULD THINK

03:24.800 --> 03:27.500
THAT THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT FRIENDS--

03:27.533 --> 03:28.867
MEN WOULD TALK ABOUT.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.600
- NO, NOBODY EVER
TALKS ABOUT THAT.
- REALLY?

03:30.633 --> 03:32.833
- NO.
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

03:32.867 --> 03:35.533
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO YOU,
BUT...

03:35.567 --> 03:38.667
- I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.
- YEAH YEAH.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.967
- YEAH.
- HUH.

03:47.133 --> 03:50.067
COMAS ARE VERY
UNPREDICTABLE.

03:50.067 --> 03:53.100
COULD WAKE UP
IN FIVE SECONDS,
FIVE MINUTES,

03:53.133 --> 03:55.467
FIVE YEARS!
YOU DON'T KNOW.
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW.

03:55.500 --> 03:58.333
THEY'RE UNPREDICTABLE.

03:58.367 --> 04:02.100
- OH! DIDN'T
EVEN TELL YOU!
- WHAT?

04:02.133 --> 04:04.833
RAN INTO SOMEBODY
YOU WENT OUT WITH.

04:04.867 --> 04:07.767
- OH.
- SHE'S LEWIS'S NURSE.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.600
- LISA THOMPSON?
- YEAH. YOU HAD
A LITTLE UH--

04:09.633 --> 04:12.133
- A LITTLE THING. YEAH.

DIDN'T YOU?

04:12.167 --> 04:14.500
- YEAH YEAH YEAH.
- HMM...

04:14.533 --> 04:16.800
- DIDN'T WORK OUT.
- YEAH.

04:18.067 --> 04:20.367
SHE TOLD ME
YOU HAD...

04:21.433 --> 04:23.567
- UH...
- WHAT?

04:25.967 --> 04:28.800
NO NO NO.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.067
- BIG VAGINA?!
- GIGANTIC VAGINA!

04:31.100 --> 04:34.233
- WHAT?!
- BIGGEST VAGINA
KNOWN TO MAN!

04:34.267 --> 04:35.633
- HUGE!
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

04:35.667 --> 04:39.700
- ARE YOU
TELLING ME THE TRUTH?
- IT'S GIGANTIC.

04:39.733 --> 04:42.633
- GIGANTIC.
- SO WHY IS SHE GOING AROUND
MAKING THIS ACCUSATION?

04:42.667 --> 04:44.733
BECAUSE MAYBE SHE'S
AFRAID THAT YOU'LL
FIND OUT

04:44.767 --> 04:46.233
SHE HAS A BIG VAGINA.
WHY WOULD WOULD SHE
EVEN DO THAT?

04:46.267 --> 04:48.200
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW.
- NIPPING IT IN THE BUD?

04:48.233 --> 04:50.667
HOW DARE SHE?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

04:50.700 --> 04:53.233
I BET YOU THERE'S
A TON OF GUYS OUT THERE

04:53.267 --> 04:55.400
WHO'VE BEEN LABELED
WITH "SMALL PENIS."

04:55.433 --> 04:57.400
- I BET YOU 50%--
- IT'S THE VAGINA, ISN'T IT?

04:57.433 --> 04:59.400
- AND IT'S THE BIG VAGINA.
- YEAH. THINK OF IT
BIOLOGICALLY--

04:59.433 --> 05:03.200
WHY SHOULD THERE BE AS MANY
BIG VAGINAS AS THERE ARE
SMALL PENISES, RIGHT?

05:03.233 --> 05:05.733
THESE BIG VAGINA LADIES
ARE GETTING AWAY
WITH MURDER.

05:05.767 --> 05:08.133
SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAN
BE DONE,

05:08.167 --> 05:09.967
- BUT SOMETHING SHOULD
BE DONE. EITHER--
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:10.067 --> 05:11.733
- WE'RE A HELL OF LOT MORE
DISCRETE THAN THEY ARE, RIGHT?
- OH, MAN, THEY--

05:11.767 --> 05:13.633
- Larry: THEY CAN'T DO
THIS ENOUGH, CAN THEY?
- OH, THEY LOVE IT,

05:13.667 --> 05:16.700
- THEY LOVE IT.
- THEY LOVE THIS THING.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:16.733 --> 05:18.700
THIS IS ME FROM NOW ON.

05:19.933 --> 05:22.167
YEAH.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.800
- EXCUSE ME.
- THE FREQUENT VISITS,

05:37.833 --> 05:39.767
THE QUESTIONS

05:39.800 --> 05:43.067
I'M NOT CRAZY.
I'M CHIEF OF STAFF HERE.
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

05:43.067 --> 05:45.700
WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:45.733 --> 05:49.300
I THINK YOU'VE
BEEN WAITING FOR
THIS MAN TO DIE

05:49.333 --> 05:53.100
SO YOU CAN GET
ONE OF HIS ORGANS,
PREFERABLY HIS KIDNEY,

05:53.133 --> 05:55.500
SO YOU WON'T HAVE
TO GIVE UP ONE,

05:55.533 --> 05:57.500
SO THAT MR. LEWIS
CAN GET IT.

05:57.533 --> 05:59.533
WHAT KIND OF PERSON
WOULD DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

05:59.567 --> 06:02.167
I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT
KIND OF PERSON WOULD
DO THAT, MR. DAVID.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.233
- A KIND OF PERSON
LIKE ME?!
- YES.

06:04.267 --> 06:06.400
( sighs )

06:07.933 --> 06:10.400

I MEAN, WITHOUT IT,

07:04.067 --> 07:06.133

SO WHAT DO YOU THINK

07:21.400 --> 07:23.667
WELL, IF YOU'RE THE BOTTOM

08:01.233 --> 08:02.800
Larry:
HEY, MR. JONES.

08:02.833 --> 08:05.667
THERE'S
ACTUALLY SOMETHING ELSE
YOU COULD DO FOR ME TOO.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.567
- REALLY?
- IT'S UNRELATED
TO THE ADOPTION.

08:07.600 --> 08:11.333

08:11.367 --> 08:14.133
- HE'S THE HEAD OF
THE KIDNEY CONSORTIUM.

08:14.167 --> 08:17.100
ANYTHING YOU CAN

13:05.467 --> 13:08.667
WHAT A MITZVAH IT WAS
FOR YOU TO LEAVE THAT NOTE

13:08.700 --> 13:11.067
WELL, HOW COULD I DO
ANYTHING LESS THAT THAT?

13:11.100 --> 13:14.200
I'D HAVE TO BE
A SOCIOPATH TO HIT
SOMEBODY'S CAR

13:14.233 --> 13:17.300
AND THEN, AND THEN
GO AWAY INTO THE NIGHT
AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED.

13:17.333 --> 13:20.067
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
- WHAT HAPPENED,

13:20.100 --> 13:22.733
I WAS LISTENING
TO JEWISH RADIO

13:22.767 --> 13:24.300
AND THEY WERE TALKING
ABOUT ISRAEL

13:24.333 --> 13:27.533
AND I GOT SO WORKED UP
I LOST CONTROL OF MY CAR.

13:27.567 --> 13:29.067
- MAY I OFFER YOU
SOME LUNCH?
- PLEASE.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.533
MORTY, MENUS, PLEASE.

13:31.567 --> 13:33.467

UH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU
FOR THAT INVITATION,

13:42.833 --> 13:46.600
BUT I CANNOT GO
TO THE BASEBALL GAME
ON THE SABBATH,

13:46.633 --> 13:48.867
I'M SORRY.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

13:48.900 --> 13:51.633
I'LL TAKE A RAIN CHECK,
HOWEVER.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.900
HO HO HO HO,
OKAY.

13:55.433 --> 13:57.367
I'D LOVE TO GO TO THE GAME,
BUT NOT ON THE SABBATH.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.333
THE YANKEES ARE PLAYING
AND I WOULD--

13:59.367 --> 14:01.367
- I WOULD KILL
TO GO DOWN THERE.
- YOU'RE A YANKEE FAN.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.367
OH, I'M A YANKEE FAN--
I'M A HUGE YANKEE FAN.

14:04.400 --> 14:08.233
- I LOVE THE YANKEES.
- YOU LOVE THE YANKEES?!

14:08.267 --> 14:10.533
THERE'S SO MANY TIMES
WHEN THE YANKEES WERE
PLAYING IN ANAHEIM

14:10.567 --> 14:12.467
THAT I'VE SO MUCH
WANTED TO GO TO SEE IT.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.900
I EVEN CHEAT
BY WATCHING IT ON TELEVISION.
I SHOULDN'T DO THAT.

14:14.933 --> 14:17.433
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA...
- SHH.

14:17.467 --> 14:19.867

14:19.900 --> 14:23.333

14:23.367 --> 14:26.533

14:29.633 --> 14:31.433

( stammers )

14:36.067 --> 14:38.267
MY YARMULKE
ALMOST FELL OFF,
I'M SO TAKEN ABACK.

14:38.300 --> 14:41.067
- WHAT?

SKIING?

14:41.100 --> 14:43.500
- YEAH. WELL, I'M NOT
THAT GOOD, BUT I LIKE--
- I'M NOT SO GOOD MYSELF,

14:43.533 --> 14:45.400
- BUT I LOVE IT.
- YOU LOVE IT?

14:45.433 --> 14:47.667
OH-- MY FAVORITE THING
TO DO IN LIFE.

14:47.700 --> 14:51.233
- ( speaks Hebrew )
- ( mimics Hebrew )

14:51.267 --> 14:53.633
ISN'T THAT
A WONDERFUL COINCIDENCE?

14:53.667 --> 14:55.767
- I HAVE A LITTLE SKI LODGE.
- REALLY?

14:55.800 --> 14:59.400
YES. I WOULD LOVE
TO INVITE YOU

14:59.433 --> 15:03.067
- TO GO SKIING
- MY GOODNESS, WHAT
A WONDERFUL GESTURE.

15:05.700 --> 15:07.167
- Larry: HELLO.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.367
- WELCOME BACK.
- SO...

15:09.400 --> 15:12.067
YOU KNOW, I SPOKE
TO OUR MUTUAL FRIEND.

15:12.100 --> 15:14.200
- OH, GOOD. DID YOU SAY
HELLO FOR ME?
- I DID.

15:14.233 --> 15:16.333
- OH, GREAT, THANK YOU.
- I DID SAY HELLO,

15:16.367 --> 15:21.133
AND I COULDN'T HELP
BUT MENTION THE--

15:21.167 --> 15:24.967
THE WHOLE KIND
OF SMALL PENIS THING.
IT CAME OUT.

15:25.067 --> 15:28.233
- OH MY GOSH, WAS HE UPSET?
- NOT AT ALL, NOT AT ALL.

15:28.267 --> 15:29.800
- NO.
- REALLY?

15:29.833 --> 15:33.533
IN FACT, HE HAD
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
TAKE ON IT THAN YOU.

15:35.300 --> 15:38.933
HE SAID
THE PROBLEM DIDN'T LIE
WITH HIS SMALL PENIS,

15:38.967 --> 15:40.967
BUT RATHER...

15:41.067 --> 15:42.967
WITH YOUR BIG VAGINA.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.367
- IS THAT WHAT HE DID?!
- YEAH.

15:49.567 --> 15:51.267
- BIG.
- THIS IS MY VAGINA?

15:51.300 --> 15:54.100
HUGE. HUGE.

15:54.133 --> 15:56.400
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I DON'T HAVE A BIG VAGINA.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.700
- YOU GOT THE HUGE VAGINA.
- OH, DO I?

15:58.733 --> 16:00.233
- YOU'RE BLAMING
THE SMALL PENIS,
- YEAH--

16:00.267 --> 16:03.500
YOU GOT THE HUGE VAGINA.
IT'S NOT NECESSARY.

16:03.533 --> 16:05.133
I MADE A LITTLE--
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT EGGED IT--

16:05.167 --> 16:08.067
METHINKS THE LADY DOTH
PROTEST TOO MUCH.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.400
HM.

16:12.900 --> 16:16.367
THIS GUY IS
THE HEAD OF THE WHOLE
KIDNEY CONSORTIUM.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.367
I CAN GET YOU
TO THE TOP OF THE LIST.
I'M NOT KIDDING.

16:19.400 --> 16:22.233
I GOT HIM
EATING OUT OF MY HAND.
HE'S GOING SKIING WITH ME.

16:22.267 --> 16:24.400
HOLY SHIT. THAT WOULD
BE UNBELIEVABLE!

16:24.433 --> 16:26.267
YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD REALLY CINCH IT?

16:26.300 --> 16:28.700
HE'S A YANKEE FAN--
BIG MICKEY MANTLE FAN.

16:28.733 --> 16:30.267
LET ME GIVE HIM
THE MICKEY MANTLE BALL.

16:30.300 --> 16:33.467
YOU'RE OUT
OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?
YOU DON'T WANT IT?

16:33.500 --> 16:35.333
- I'M NUTS?
- YOU DON'T WANT IT ANYMORE?

16:35.367 --> 16:38.067

IT'S DONE, IT'S OVER.

16:38.067 --> 16:39.567
ALL RIGHT, GIVE IT TO HIM.

16:43.167 --> 16:45.700
- HEY.

16:45.733 --> 16:48.867
- WHERE'S THE BALL?
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:48.900 --> 16:50.767
WHAT? LOOK,
MAYBE IT ROLLED OFF.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.667
LOOK BEHIND THE PICTURE.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.700
- IS IT THERE?
- NO.

16:54.733 --> 16:56.967
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
- NO.

16:57.067 --> 16:59.133
JESUS CHRIST.

16:59.167 --> 17:01.067
OH, MICKEY.

17:01.067 --> 17:03.433
GODDAMN IT!
( coughs )

17:03.467 --> 17:05.700
- OH, SHIT.
- WHO'S BEEN HERE?

17:05.733 --> 17:09.400
WHO'S BEEN HERE?
LISA, THE NURSE, A COUPLE
OF CLOSE FRIENDS AND YOU.

17:09.433 --> 17:11.433
IT'S NO WAY
MY FRIENDS ARE GONNA
TAKE ANYTHING,

17:11.467 --> 17:13.867
AND HER-- I SEE HER LEAVE
WITH THE SAME UNIFORM.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.400
SHE HAS NO POCKETS.
I MEAN, IF SHE, IF SHE
HID A BALL IN THERE,

17:16.433 --> 17:18.367
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE
AN ELEPHANT TUMOR.

17:19.367 --> 17:20.867
UNLESS...

17:21.900 --> 17:23.933
OH, HEY.

17:26.167 --> 17:27.600
THERE WAS
A MICKEY MANTLE BALL,

17:27.633 --> 17:30.400
HIS 500th HOME RUN

17:30.433 --> 17:32.500
RIGHT OVER OVER THERE,

17:32.533 --> 17:35.600
AND IT'S MISSING.

17:35.633 --> 17:39.900
- HAVE YOU SEEN IT?
- NO, I HAVE NOT.

17:39.933 --> 17:43.633
HMM, IT'S KIND OF CURIOUS,
GIVEN THAT...

17:43.667 --> 17:47.067
NOBODY ELSE HAS
BEEN IN THE HOUSE,
SAVE FOR A FEW FRIENDS.

17:51.733 --> 17:56.067
COULD A BALL WORTH
AN EXCESS OF $20,000

17:56.067 --> 17:58.767
JUST DISAPPEAR
INTO THIN AIR?

18:00.800 --> 18:03.200
WANNA TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE DRIVING AT?

18:03.233 --> 18:05.333
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'M DRIVING AT.

18:05.367 --> 18:08.067
I SUBMIT YOU TOOK
THAT BASEBALL,

18:08.067 --> 18:11.133
STASHED IT IN YOUR
UNUSUALLY LARGE VAGINA,

18:11.167 --> 18:13.200
AND WALKED RIGHT ON
OUT OF HERE!

18:19.967 --> 18:21.600

SEEN MY CELL PHONE?

18:28.733 --> 18:30.700
- NO.
- NO?

18:30.733 --> 18:32.867
- YOU CAN'T FIND IT?
- NO.

18:32.900 --> 18:34.600
- NO, IT'S GONE.
- WE'LL LOOK AGAIN
WHEN WE GET HOME.

18:34.633 --> 18:38.400
OH, REMEMBER?

18:38.433 --> 18:41.533
- YOU INVITED ME
TO THE SKI LODGE?
- YEAH.

18:41.567 --> 18:43.933
- I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

18:43.967 --> 18:45.733

18:45.767 --> 18:48.700
- Susie: GREAT.
OH THAT'LL BE GREAT.

18:48.733 --> 18:51.200
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A GREAT TIME SKIING,
SNOWBOARDING MAYBE.

18:51.233 --> 18:53.300
- I WOULD LOVE
TO TRY SNOWBOARDING.
- YEAH, I'M GONNA TRY IT.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.767
- I'M GONNA TAKE A LESSON.
- YES, WE'LL TAKE A LESSON.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.733
- THAT'S GOOD.
- THAT'S FUN.
YOU'LL LIKE THAT.

18:57.767 --> 19:00.067
- Cheryl: OH MY GOSH.
- I'M NOT GONNA SNOWBOARD.

19:00.067 --> 19:02.500
- Cheryl: THAT'S OKAY.
- OH, AND I HOPE YOU
DON'T MIND,

19:02.533 --> 19:05.133
BUT, AHEM...
I'VE ALSO

19:05.167 --> 19:07.167
TAKEN THE LIBERTY,
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,

19:07.200 --> 19:10.633
OF INVITING AN ORTHODOX
JEW AND HIS DAUGHTER.

19:10.667 --> 19:13.700
WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
AN ORTHODOX-- AN ORTHODOX
JEW AND HIS DAUGHTER?

19:13.733 --> 19:15.600
WHERE? TO STAY
IN THE CHALET WITH US?

19:15.633 --> 19:16.800
- OKAY.

19:16.833 --> 19:18.600
- THE GUY, YEAH.
- Women: WHAT GUY?

19:18.633 --> 19:22.533
OKAY, HE'S THE HEAD
OF THE KIDNEY CONSORTIUM

19:22.567 --> 19:26.200
AND I'M TRYING TO GET
RICHARD LEWIS MOVED UP
ON THE LIST.

19:26.233 --> 19:29.400
LET'S BE REALISTIC.
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET
LEWIS MOVED UP ON THE LIST

19:29.433 --> 19:32.433
- OR YOU'RE TRYING
TO SAVE YOUR OWN KIDNEY?
- WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

19:32.467 --> 19:35.067
- LET'S BE CLEAR HERE
ON WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
- OKAY, FINE.

19:35.067 --> 19:36.700
- I DON'T WANNA
GIVE HIM MY OWN KIDNEY.
- I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT

19:36.733 --> 19:38.767
- TO SPEND A WEEKEND
WITH THESE PEOPLE.
- WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THEM--

19:38.800 --> 19:41.067
FORGET THE WHOLE THING.
I DON'T WANT MY KIDNEY.

19:41.067 --> 19:43.133
- Susie: YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU--
- HE CAN HAVE MY KIDNEY!

19:43.167 --> 19:45.500
I'LL WALK AROUND
WITH A DIALYSIS MACHINE.
THAT WILL BE FINE!

19:45.533 --> 19:49.300
- THAT'S FINE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
- IF YOU GOTTA DO IT,

19:49.333 --> 19:52.267
- YOU GOTTA DO IT.
IT IS OKAY. FINE.
- THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

19:52.300 --> 19:53.533
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
YOU INVITED THEM.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.567
Jeff:
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE,
BUT IT'S A MITZVAH.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.667
- YOU SPEND TIME WITH THEM.
- Cheryl: I'M NOT GOING TO HANG
OUT WITH THEM ALL DAY.

19:59.700 --> 20:04.333
- UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S NOT
THE WORST OF THE SITUATION.
- Jeff: WHAT?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.700
- SHE'S A WONDERFUL COOK,
ISN'T SHE? MY SUSIE?
- Susie: MY PLEASURE.

20:13.733 --> 20:18.100
- ISN'T SHE?
ISN'T SHE SOME COOK?
- HOW DID YOU TWO MEET?

20:18.133 --> 20:21.367
- Larry:
INTERESTING, INTERESTING.
- UH, WE MET AT A HILLEL--

20:21.400 --> 20:23.667
- MIXER, A FUNCTION.
- OH, IN COLLEGE?

20:23.700 --> 20:28.300
YES, A SINGLES AND HE WAS
THERE TRYING TO PICK UP
EVERY GIRL IMAGINABLE.

20:28.333 --> 20:30.867
- I WAS PRETTY SWINGING
IN THOSE DAYS.
- Susie: YES.

20:30.900 --> 20:33.133
Larry:
I WAS IN THE BAND, OKAY?

20:33.167 --> 20:36.300
THE GIRLS WERE PRETTY
INTERESTED, YOU KNOW?

20:36.333 --> 20:38.000
WITH THE GUITAR,
THEY LIKED THAT.

20:38.033 --> 20:39.700
- Susie: NOT TRUE, NOT TRUE.
- LIKE A ROCK BAND?

20:39.733 --> 20:41.467
- Larry: JEWISH FOLK MUSIC,
JEWISH FOLK SONGS.
- Susie: FOLK, FOLK.

20:41.500 --> 20:46.733
- Girl: LIKE WHAT SONGS?
- UM, "GEFILTE FISH BLUES"...

20:46.767 --> 20:50.167
UM, "MY FREAKING BACK
IS KILLING ME AND

20:50.200 --> 20:51.933
IT'S MAKING IT
HARD TO KVELL"...

20:51.967 --> 20:55.733
- UH, WHAT WAS THE NAME
OF YOUR BAND?
- "THE HIPSTERS."

20:55.767 --> 20:57.167
Susie:
YES, IT WAS
"THE HIPSTERS."

20:57.200 --> 20:59.267
- "LARRY DAVID
AND THE HIPSTERS."
- Susie: YEAH.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.700
AND THEN,
I LEFT THE HIPSTERS,

21:01.733 --> 21:03.367
- AND I JUST
BECAME LARRY DAVID.
- Susie: LARRY DAVID.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.233
Larry:
AND THE HIPSTERS
WENT OUT ON THEIR OWN.

21:05.267 --> 21:07.967
- AND THEY BECAME
QUITE SUCCESSFUL.
- Susie: YES.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.667
Susie: BUT I WASN'T
ATTRACTED TO HIM
FROM THE BAND.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.800
- HONESTLY, I FELT
SORRY FOR HIM.
- Ben: WHY?

21:12.833 --> 21:15.633
THAT'S WAS THE--
( speaks Hebrew )

21:15.667 --> 21:18.733
IT WAS AN ATTRACTION
OUT OF PITY 'CAUSE I'M
ALWAYS THE ONE

21:18.767 --> 21:20.533
TO TAKE IN STRAY ANIMALS,
YOU KNOW, THAT'S--

21:20.567 --> 21:22.567
YOU REMIND ME
A LITTLE OF MY WIFE--
( speaks Hebrew )

21:22.600 --> 21:25.333
- OH, HOW LOVELY.
- I WOULD LIKE TO MEET HER
AT SOME POINT.

21:25.367 --> 21:28.167
WELL, SHE'S PASSED AWAY
A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.333
- Girl: SIX YEARS.
- Susie: SIX YEARS?
DIFFICULT.

21:30.367 --> 21:33.600
- EH...
- Girl: VERY.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.933
Larry:
SO, ANYWAY,
ENOUGH ABOUT US.

21:37.967 --> 21:41.767
- WHAT DO YOU DO?
- I'M THE HEAD OF
A FOUNDATION

21:41.800 --> 21:45.067
THAT FINDS KIDNEYS
FOR...

21:45.100 --> 21:47.200
- NEEDY RECIPIENTS.
- Girl: GLOBAL.

21:47.233 --> 21:51.600

21:58.100 --> 21:59.700

21:59.733 --> 22:02.100
- Susie: YES, YEAH.

22:02.133 --> 22:04.767
- IF ONLY WE WERE A MATCH,
BUT UNFORTUNATELY...
- Girl: YEAH.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.567
- THAT'S ALAS,
THAT IS NOT THE CASE.
- Ben: THAT'S GOD'S WILL.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.067
- Girl: OF COURSE.

22:09.067 --> 22:12.133
( mimics Hebrew )

22:12.167 --> 22:15.900
- EXCUSE ME?
- ( mimics Hebrew )

22:46.967 --> 22:49.833
( gasping )

23:13.933 --> 23:16.067
( hisses )
WHAT THE FUCK?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

23:16.100 --> 23:18.267
- WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?
- I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

23:18.300 --> 23:20.400
- WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN BED WITH ME?
- MY BACK HURTS.

23:20.433 --> 23:22.300
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.
DO YOU THINK I CARE
ABOUT YOUR BACK?

23:22.333 --> 23:24.567
- COME ON.
- YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I'VE DONE
FOR YOU THIS WEEKEND?

23:24.600 --> 23:25.900
- GET THE FUCK OUT OF BED.
- IT'S COLD.

23:25.933 --> 23:27.067
GET THE FUCK
OUT OF BED!

23:40.167 --> 23:42.200
- WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
- WHAT? EGGS.

23:42.233 --> 23:44.633
WHAT?! BACON?!

23:44.667 --> 23:46.700
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?
YOU'RE MAKING BACON?!

23:46.733 --> 23:48.200
- WHY?
- WHY?

23:48.233 --> 23:51.067
- WHAT?
- HUH?

23:51.067 --> 23:53.800
PEOPLE DON'T EAT BACON.
WHAT, ARE YOU NUTS?

23:53.833 --> 23:55.400
IT'S NOT KOSHER.
PEOPLE-- KOSHER,

23:55.433 --> 23:57.867
- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
- WELL, THEY DON'T HAVE
TO EAT IT.

23:58.967 --> 24:00.667
HOW DID YOU DO
LAST NIGHT?

24:02.200 --> 24:03.833
I DID FINE.
HOW DID YOU DO?

24:03.867 --> 24:06.200
I MISSED YOU, HONEY.

24:06.233 --> 24:09.067
I MISSED YOU TOO.

24:09.067 --> 24:11.200
- GOOD MORNING.
- GOOD MORNING.

24:11.233 --> 24:13.400
- Cheryl: GOOD MORNING.
- UH, WERE THESE NOT
THE PLATES

24:13.433 --> 24:15.200
(A
WE ATE THE POT ROAST ON
LAST NIGHT?

24:15.233 --> 24:18.933
THEY ARE THE SAME PLATES,
BUT THEY'VE BEEN WASHED.

24:18.967 --> 24:22.067
- WHAT?!
- I SHOULDN'T BE HAVING DAIRY
ON THESE KIND OF PLATES.

24:22.067 --> 24:24.600
YOU KNOW, AS YOU KNOW,
THE DAIRY AND THE MEAT ARE
ON TWO SEPARATE PLATES.

24:24.633 --> 24:26.267
THAT'S A NECESSARY RULE
OF BEING KOSHER.

24:26.300 --> 24:29.067
WHERE ARE THE MILCHIG PLATES?
WHERE ARE THEY?

24:29.067 --> 24:31.067
- THE MILCHIG PLATES!
- WHERE ARE THEY?

24:31.067 --> 24:34.167
THE MILCHIG PLATES--
WELL, THEY SHOULD BE
IN THE CABINET.

24:34.200 --> 24:38.433
YOU WERE TOLD ABOUT
THE MILCHIG PLATES,
WERE YOU NOT?

24:38.467 --> 24:41.100
- OKAY. WELL, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE UH--
- THAT'S FINE,

24:41.133 --> 24:44.633
- I HAVE TO BURY THE PLATE AND
WE'RE GONNA BE DONE WITH IT.
- YOU'RE GONNA DO WHAT?

24:44.667 --> 24:48.467
- YOU HAVE TO BURY THE PLATE.
- WHY WOULD YOU BURY A PLATE?

24:52.900 --> 24:55.800
WHY WOULD YOU
BURY A PLATE?

24:55.833 --> 24:58.200
TELL HER.

24:58.233 --> 25:00.467
YOU HAVE TO BURY
THE PLATE TO PURIFY IT.
IT HAS TO GO UNDERGROUND.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.433
- PURIFY, YOU HAVE TO PURIFY.
- I'M SURE YOU PROBABLY HAVE
A WHOLE SET OF CHINA

25:03.467 --> 25:06.900
- IN YOUR BACKYARD.
- YOU CAN'T JUST WASH IT
AND CALL IT A DAY?

25:06.933 --> 25:10.200
- UH, NO WE CAN'T.
I GUESS WE'LL STARVE TONIGHT.
- NO, NO, YOU CAN'T WASH IT

25:10.233 --> 25:14.633
AND CALL IT A DAY, NO.
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

25:14.667 --> 25:16.700
- DO YOU WANNA BURY IT
AS THE MAN OF THE HOUSE?
- NAH, YOU BURY.

25:16.733 --> 25:19.100
- AS A RESPECT--
- YOU BURY, YOU BURY.

25:19.133 --> 25:21.133
IT'S A LITTLE
EARLY FOR BURYING.

25:21.167 --> 25:24.467
I DON'T LIKE TO BURY
BEFORE COFFEE.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.967
- DO I SMELL BACON?
- BACON?

25:27.067 --> 25:28.800
- WELL--
- NO. OH, I WAS
A LITTLE GASSY.

25:28.833 --> 25:30.767
I LIT A MATCH.

25:34.733 --> 25:35.800
YOU ARE A GUEST
IN THIS HOUSE.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.100
Cheryl:
LARRY, COME ON.

25:59.333 --> 26:01.333
LARRY.

26:07.067 --> 26:10.367
( grunts,
groaning )

26:10.400 --> 26:12.833
GET OFF MY SKIS.

26:15.867 --> 26:17.767
( groans )

26:23.733 --> 26:25.900
- HOW ABOUT COMING
FOR ONE MORE RUN?
- OH, SWEETHEART,

26:25.933 --> 26:28.067

FOR ONE MORE.

26:28.067 --> 26:29.700
- WHOA-HO.
HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY.

26:29.733 --> 26:32.900

26:32.933 --> 26:34.433
- HELLO, BEN.
- HELLO..

26:34.467 --> 26:36.500
- HELLO, RACHEL.
- HI, LARRY.

26:36.533 --> 26:39.300
- BOY, THAT WAS HARD.
- Larry: HUH?

26:39.333 --> 26:41.333
- HOW MUCH FUN IS THIS?
- I'M HAVING A GOOD TIME.

26:41.367 --> 26:44.500
- ISN'T THIS FUN?
- BUT I'M GOING HOME
BECAUSE I'M BUSHED.

26:44.533 --> 26:45.767
- I'M GONNA GO
FOR ANOTHER RUN.
- GO GO, SWEETHEART, GO.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.400
- ALL RIGHT.
- WHY DON'T YOU GO WITH HER?

26:47.433 --> 26:49.233
- YOU GOT TIME
FOR ONE MORE RUN.
- ONE MORE?

26:49.267 --> 26:51.900
- GO AHEAD.
- ONE MORE RUN. OKAY.

26:51.933 --> 26:53.800
- I'M JUST GONNA GO BACK.
- NO, THERE'S TIME.

26:53.833 --> 26:55.767
NO NO, WE'RE LOSING TIME.
NO NO, IT'S FINE.
I'M TIRED.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.200
- ONE MORE RUN.
- ONE MORE.

26:57.233 --> 26:59.267
WE'LL DO ONE MORE.
RACHEL, UH...

26:59.300 --> 27:02.367
HE'LL KEEP YOU COMPANY.
( speaks Hebrew )

27:02.400 --> 27:03.867
- ( mimics Hebrew )
- ( Ben laughs )

27:03.900 --> 27:06.833
LARRY, INCIDENTALLY,
THE THING WE WERE
DISCUSSING EARLIER.

27:06.867 --> 27:10.400
I'M THINKING ABOUT IT,
AND I THINK I CAN ACTUALLY
HELP YOUR FRIEND.

27:11.700 --> 27:14.967
I THINK I CAN
MOVE HIM UP ON THE LIST.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.633
I'M FAINTING.
I'M GONNA FAINT.

27:18.667 --> 27:20.767
- Ben: WELL, DON'T DO THAT.
- I'M GOING TO FAINT.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.467
( speaks Hebrew )
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO DO IT FOR YOU.

27:23.500 --> 27:26.367
I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING--
WHEN HE DIES--

27:26.400 --> 27:29.400
RIGHT, RIGHT UPSTAIRS
HE'S GOING. RIGHT UPSTAIRS.

27:29.433 --> 27:31.500
- GOD BLESS YOU.
- YOU'RE TAKING AN ESCALATOR
UP THERE.

27:31.533 --> 27:34.100
GOD BLESS YOU.
NOW YOU TWO KIDS GO.
GO SKI.

27:34.133 --> 27:37.367
RACHEL, COME.
COME.

27:44.633 --> 27:48.167
( Larry whistles )

27:48.200 --> 27:50.200
WHAT DO PEOPLE HAVE
AGAINST WHISTLERS?

27:50.233 --> 27:53.333
- CAN YOU
ANSWER ME THIS QUESTION?
- I THINK IT'S ANNOYING.

27:53.367 --> 27:56.567
I THINK IT'S 'CAUSE
THEY DON'T LIKE TO SEE
PEOPLE HAPPY.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.967
AND WHO CAN BLAME THEM?
IT'S LIKE A HAPPY COUPLE.

27:59.067 --> 28:02.067
IS THERE ANYTHING
MORE DISGUSTING THAN THAT?

28:03.433 --> 28:05.433
YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND
VERY INTERESTING?

28:05.467 --> 28:08.067
I CAN'T DRAW
TO SAVE MY LIFE,

28:08.100 --> 28:10.633
BUT YET, I'M A VERY
GOOD DOODLER.

28:10.667 --> 28:12.633
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S IRONIC?

28:12.667 --> 28:14.300
IT'S SOMEWHAT IRONIC.

28:14.333 --> 28:16.200
HEY, WHEN WE GET
BACK TO THE LODGE,

28:16.233 --> 28:18.800
HOW ABOUT
YOU AND I HAVING
A DOODLING CONTEST, HUH?

28:18.833 --> 28:22.167
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- I'M FEELING NAUSEOUS
RIGHT NOW.

28:26.733 --> 28:28.667
OH, YOU'VE GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.533
- Larry: WHAT'S GOING ON?
- DON'T WORRY.

28:30.567 --> 28:32.433
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

28:32.467 --> 28:34.833
( sighs )

28:34.867 --> 28:37.133
SHOULD ONLY BE
A FEW MINUTES.

28:50.067 --> 28:52.433
IT'S BEEN 15 MINUTES
ALREADY.

28:52.467 --> 28:53.967
WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:54.067 --> 28:57.300
SHKIYAS HACHAMA.
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON.

28:58.367 --> 29:01.400
- WHAT?
- SHKIYAS HACHAMA.

29:01.433 --> 29:03.233
SUNDOWN.

29:03.267 --> 29:06.900
I CAN'T BE HERE
ALONE WITH YOU
AFTER SUNDOWN.

29:06.933 --> 29:09.133
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE YOU'RE A MAN

29:09.167 --> 29:11.133
AND I'M A SINGLE WOMAN.

29:11.167 --> 29:15.433
- SO?
- SO IT'S NOT ALLOWED.

29:15.467 --> 29:17.700
- WHO SAYS SO?
- THE LAW, THE TORAH
SAYS SO.

29:17.733 --> 29:20.267
- HASHEM SAYS SO.
- HASHEM?

29:20.300 --> 29:23.067
- DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING?
- NO, HASHEM, I KNOW.

29:23.067 --> 29:25.633
ANYWAY, IT'S OKAY.
THERE'S EXTENUATING
CIRCUMSTANCES HERE.

29:25.667 --> 29:28.933
NO SUCH THING
AS EXTENUATING
CIRCUMSTANCES.

29:30.067 --> 29:32.133
WELL, YOU GOT
ANOTHER HALF HOUR.

29:32.167 --> 29:34.700
- 5:41. SHKIYAS HACHAMA
IS AT 5:41.
- ALL RIGHT.

29:34.733 --> 29:36.867
- WELL, THAT'S
A HALF HOUR.
- FINE.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.333
THEY'LL FIX IT.

29:53.367 --> 29:55.933
- FREEZING!
- ( snorts )

29:55.967 --> 29:57.933
( sighs )

29:57.967 --> 30:00.467
I'M HUNGRY TOO.

30:00.500 --> 30:04.233
- YOU HUNGRY?
- YES, I'M VERY HUNGRY.

30:10.567 --> 30:12.500
WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

30:16.633 --> 30:18.700
HEY!

30:18.733 --> 30:21.433
EDIBLE UNDERWEAR!

30:21.467 --> 30:24.033
I MUST--
THE PRIVATE
INVESTIGATOR--

30:24.067 --> 30:27.433
WHEN I WENT--
UNREAL!

30:39.733 --> 30:42.333
- THEY'RE NOT BAD.
- ( sighs )

30:42.367 --> 30:44.000
- HOW MUCH TIME
DO WE HAVE LEFT--
- WANT SOME?

30:44.033 --> 30:45.267
- NO, THANK YOU.
- TAKE A BITE.

30:45.300 --> 30:46.467
- I'M FINE.
- TAKE A BITE.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.533
MOVE THAT AWAY FROM ME.

30:53.067 --> 30:55.800
JUST TELL ME
