10:27.827 --> 10:29.886
She was nice,
if that's what you mean.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.291
- Did you drug her?
- No.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.726
Did you get her off drugs?

10:32.899 --> 10:34.628
We just talked and we hit it off.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.292
I even did my Marcia Brady
impression for her. Yeah.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.960

Oh, I think I know
where that came from.

11:21.114 --> 11:25.175
All I can figure is that somehow
Baby K2K and I switched personalities.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.047
What do you mean, "somehow"?
Did you cast a spell?

11:28.221 --> 11:31.622
No. Well, maybe a little one.
But believe me, you would have too.

11:31.791 --> 11:33.850
- She was scary.
- How scary?

Nothing, really.
I just said to make her like me.

11:42.168 --> 11:45.433
Oh, my God, I wanted her to like me,
not become like me.

11:45.605 --> 11:48.870
And somehow I ended up like her.
Except without the money and fame.

11:49.475 --> 11:50.772
Well, it happened,

11:50.944 --> 11:53.412

He's a peeping Tom who doesn't like
music, children or dogs.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.160
And he is the reason
that the ice-cream man

19:28.334 --> 19:29.926
doesn't come
to our neighborhood anymore.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.729
Isn't that right, sir?

19:31.904 --> 19:35.806
How many times can any human being
listen to "It's a Small World"?

19:35.975 --> 19:36.999
[SPECTATORS MURMURING]

19:37.176 --> 19:38.700
JUDGE:
All right, quiet.

19:38.878 --> 19:42.507
You, young lady,
have to control your attitude.

19:43.649 --> 19:46.345
- Thank you.
- And you, pencil neck,

19:46.519 --> 19:48.146
need to stop complaining
to your neighbors

19:48.320 --> 19:51.778
about every little thing
and accusing people willy-nilly.

19:51.957 --> 19:54.221
It could have been anyone
who scratched your car.

19:54.393 --> 19:58.295
In fact, if I lived next to a jerk like you,
I might have done it too.

19:58.464 --> 20:00.432
Case dismissed.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.870
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.437
Hey, what are friends for?

20:07.606 --> 20:11.303
But if it turns out you poisoned
his rose bushes, I don't know you.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.672
Oh, here you are.
Sorry it took so long.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.643
Don't worry about it.
Lift the spell already.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.407
What do you mean?
I fixed it an hour ago.

20:17.583 --> 20:18.607
- Sign here.
- But...

20:18.784 --> 20:21.150
That other girl's spell
should be winding down any minute.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.515
Do you want me to read it again,
sweetie?

20:25.024 --> 20:27.049
Do I look like I want to read it again?

20:27.226 --> 20:31.959
I am not LeVar Burton,
and this is not Reading Rainbow.

20:32.131 --> 20:34.497
Okay, that should do it.
Here's my card.

20:34.667 --> 20:38.535
Don't forget, I also fix faulty hexes,
potions and garbage disposals.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.604
One thing I can't figure out.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.402
If the spell was lifted,
what just happened here?

20:44.910 --> 20:46.434
I guess it was all me.

20:46.612 --> 20:49.172
It turns out if I really want to
and my friends are on the line,

20:49.348 --> 20:50.838
I can kick some serious butt.

20:52.118 --> 20:54.985
Yeah, that felt good. I was smoking.

20:55.154 --> 20:57.714
I hope I didn't hurt anyone's feelings.

21:02.561 --> 21:06.395
Annie, I just wanted to say I'm sorry
I had to bail on the Baby K2K story.

21:06.565 --> 21:07.589
That's it?

21:07.767 --> 21:11.134
You're not gonna get all up in my face
and snap your witty street talk at me?

21:11.303 --> 21:14.466
No, and, you know,
I feel really awful about that too.

21:14.673 --> 21:15.697
Oh, that's too bad.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.002
I thought you might have been
getting interesting.

21:18.177 --> 21:22.511
You know, a word of advice,
find a personality and stick with it.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.580
I don't know
what makes her think she's all that.
