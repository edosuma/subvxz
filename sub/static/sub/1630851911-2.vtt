00:11.200 --> 00:14.720
BASED ON AN UNSOLVED CRIME

00:21.240 --> 00:23.760
-Stig, may we come in?
-Of course.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.680
Yes, we…

00:26.440 --> 00:28.200
we heard about your contribution.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.560
After such an incident,
how… how does it feel?

00:35.040 --> 00:36.960
How it feels? Well…

00:38.080 --> 00:39.800
I guess I feel hollow…

00:41.800 --> 00:43.120
and guilty.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.040
Guilty?

00:47.120 --> 00:49.880
Yes, we tried, but we lost him.

00:50.720 --> 00:54.600
-That's something I have to live with.
-But you…

00:54.680 --> 00:56.560
You're a hero.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.160
A lot of people say that, but I…

00:59.880 --> 01:02.000
It's hard for me to see it that way.

01:02.640 --> 01:05.040
I heard that you ran after the murderer.

01:05.120 --> 01:07.480
Yes, to no avail, I'm afraid.

01:09.880 --> 01:12.600
We won't keep you.
It was great talking to you.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.280
-Thank you, Stig.
-Thank you.

01:18.440 --> 01:19.680
This is Engström.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.880
Hello, I'm Göran Fors,
and I'm calling from the police.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.480
Okay, hello.

01:25.560 --> 01:29.440
We need to go through your memories
from the evening of the murder,

01:29.520 --> 01:33.080
just to get
as complete a picture as possible.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.680
-Do you have time to talk?
-Yes, of course.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.200
Okay, great.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.280
Let's start at the beginning.

01:40.360 --> 01:44.680
You were at work
just before the murder, right?

01:44.760 --> 01:47.800
Yes, it was after 11:00 p.m.

01:49.720 --> 01:53.560
I was in a hurry to finish up
to go on a ski trip with my wife.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.440
What were you wearing?

01:55.520 --> 01:58.520
I was wearing a dark coat…

01:59.400 --> 02:02.080
that went below my knees.

02:02.760 --> 02:05.160
The coat was buttoned up.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.200
As you might know,

02:07.280 --> 02:09.520
it was a rather cold… cold night.

02:10.480 --> 02:12.000
Were you wearing a hat?

02:13.120 --> 02:18.720
A normal cap of mixed shades,
without fasteners or ear flaps.

02:19.880 --> 02:22.920
At what time did you leave Skandia?

02:23.400 --> 02:27.800
I left Skandia at 11:21 p.m.,

02:27.880 --> 02:34.400
but I was in a hurry
to catch the last subway,

02:34.480 --> 02:36.200
so I'm almost running.

02:37.480 --> 02:40.080
Suddenly, I hear a bang.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.400
At first, I thought it was fireworks,

02:43.480 --> 02:47.160
but then I see a body lying on the ground.

02:47.960 --> 02:51.760
At the time,
I had no idea that it was Olof Palme,

02:51.840 --> 02:54.880
but then I heard that he had been shot.

02:54.960 --> 02:58.000
And Lisbeth Palme, what did she do?

02:58.080 --> 03:02.720
She was obviously in despair and shock,

03:03.440 --> 03:08.080
but still calm at times.
I could communicate with her.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.520
-So you spoke to her?
-Yes, sure.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.840
-What was he wearing?
-A blue…

03:13.880 --> 03:15.240
A quilted jacket.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.000
Then what happened?

03:19.960 --> 03:22.240
He… He ran that way.

03:23.120 --> 03:27.320
I realized I should've told the policemen
about the blue quilted jacket,

03:27.400 --> 03:31.720
so I ran after them
to inform them about it.

03:32.760 --> 03:37.000
But the policemen were already gone,

03:37.680 --> 03:40.080
so I decided to return.

03:40.840 --> 03:44.120
That's when I heard a witness…

03:45.360 --> 03:49.000
give a description
that matched my clothes.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.560
Did you inform the policemen at the scene?

03:52.640 --> 03:55.720
My name is Stig Engström.
I was one of the first ones here.

03:55.800 --> 04:00.200
There seems to have been a mix-up
between me and the murderer.

04:00.280 --> 04:03.240
We have enough testimonies. Please leave.

04:05.480 --> 04:08.480
At that point, it seemed better to leave.

04:12.880 --> 04:17.640
Okay. I don't have any more questions.

04:18.640 --> 04:22.160
-Unless you have something to add.
-No, that was all.

04:22.240 --> 04:25.000
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you. Thanks. Bye.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.360
Hi, my name is Thomas Pettersson.

05:01.440 --> 05:05.200
I'm a journalist,
and I'm interested in the Palme murder.

05:05.280 --> 05:09.240
I have a theory. Do you have time
to meet up someday so I can run it by you?

05:09.760 --> 05:11.840
-Sven?
-Well, hello.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.120
-Hi, Thomas.
-Hi.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.920
I'm so glad you wanted to meet me.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.920
You may be able
to help me with an article.

05:20.520 --> 05:26.560
It's almost touching that a normal person
still has an interest in the Palme murder.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.960
I don't know if I'm normal.

05:29.040 --> 05:32.720
I've only been digging for two years,
so you have a head start.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.400
I've worked on it for about 20 years,

05:35.480 --> 05:39.200
so I've become a kind of doyen
among the private investigators.

05:39.960 --> 05:43.720
For me, it all started
when I read that Olof Palme

05:43.800 --> 05:46.080
worked with the CIA when he was young.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.760
And…

05:48.880 --> 05:54.280
I can't shake this feeling
that it's connected to the murder somehow.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.760
But how?

05:57.840 --> 06:02.040
After World War II,
Stay-behind was formed.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.680
It was a secret resistance movement

06:03.760 --> 06:06.120
formed to prevent Russian aggression
and directed by NATO.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.200
It was present everywhere
in the Western world, in Sweden too.

06:09.280 --> 06:12.760
The Social Democrats
helped build Stay-behind.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.080
-That's correct.
-Yes.

06:14.920 --> 06:18.400
One name keeps popping up everywhere…

06:19.920 --> 06:20.840
Skandia.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.600
Really?

06:23.680 --> 06:26.840
Stay-behind's base
was located in Skandia's basement.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.320
The first head of Stay-behind Sweden
was the CEO of Skandia.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.480
Palme's father and grandfather
were heads of Skandia,

06:33.560 --> 06:36.480
and he was murdered
outside the Skandia building.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.120
That can't be a coincidence.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.960
Have you heard the name Stig Engström?

06:45.520 --> 06:47.160
"I WAS MISTAKEN FOR THE MURDERER"

06:47.240 --> 06:49.720
The Parliament's plenary hall was full…

06:49.800 --> 06:52.360
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.560
…political veterans.

06:54.640 --> 06:58.880
Ulla Lindström, Gunnar Sträng,
Torsten Nilsson, and Jarl Hjalmarson.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.160
It should be known that our opinions about
what was the best solution often diverged.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.160
But the gap between us…

07:09.920 --> 07:11.600
I'll be home at six o'clock.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.200
-Okay. You've got a breadcrumb on…
-Okay.

07:15.280 --> 07:16.760
-Have a nice day.
-Thanks.

07:16.840 --> 07:20.360
…that separate us from the forces,

07:20.440 --> 07:24.480
the ideologies and the men
who have orchestrated this crime.

07:24.560 --> 07:25.600
TRIBUTE TO PALME

07:25.680 --> 07:29.360
Olof Palme's family
was also present at the memorial,

07:30.240 --> 07:34.120
where the Prime Minister's empty seat
was filled with flowers.

07:36.720 --> 07:40.440
-What was your impression of Engström?
-A bit of a know-it-all.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.840
But he's probably just a dork.

07:43.920 --> 07:48.560
Did any of the witnesses
see Engström run after the police?

07:49.240 --> 07:50.280
No.

07:52.880 --> 07:58.360
Okay, so Engström leaves Skandia
and hurries towards the subway.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.720
He hears a shot
and sees Palme on the ground.

08:02.680 --> 08:05.680
Then he must have passed
the witness Anders Björkman,

08:05.760 --> 08:08.200
who stood behind the Palme couple.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.160
How could he have missed him?

08:14.920 --> 08:17.320
-So Engström is lying?
-Of course he is.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.800
We can't leave it like this.

08:21.480 --> 08:23.320
We have to call Engström again.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.880
This time you'll call, Lennart.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.000
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Stig.

08:37.800 --> 08:39.560
Here's a number for you to call.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.120
The police.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.640
-Good morning.
-Morning.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.160
-Lennart Granström.
-Good day.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.600
-It's Stig Engström.
-Hello, Stig!

09:26.680 --> 09:28.360
Thanks for calling.

09:28.440 --> 09:32.200
We've got a few additional questions.

09:33.280 --> 09:35.560
Just so we don't misunderstand each other.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.440
-I understand.
-Great.

09:39.480 --> 09:43.040
So, let me ask you, when you left Skandia

09:43.120 --> 09:48.960
the night of February 28th, did you happen
to see anyone before the shots were fired?

09:49.480 --> 09:52.680
-You mean if I saw the murderer?
-Did you?

09:54.280 --> 09:55.720
-No.
-Nobody else?

09:55.800 --> 09:57.680
Witnesses close by or…?

09:58.200 --> 10:00.560
No, I didn't see anyone, and…

10:01.160 --> 10:04.720
if I missed anyone,
there is a natural explanation because…

10:05.640 --> 10:11.240
about where the advertising pillar is,
I stopped to look at my watch.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.840
Because of its black face,

10:14.920 --> 10:17.840
it was difficult to tell the time,

10:18.360 --> 10:22.800
so I might've missed
any people on the sidewalk.

10:24.640 --> 10:28.280
So Engström claims that he was looking
at his watch all this time?

10:28.360 --> 10:32.560
Apparently, he was checking to see
if he was going to make it to the subway.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.880
Therefore he missed people walking by
as well as the murder.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.480
Okay, wait a minute.

10:40.200 --> 10:44.920
So, for a distance of 50 meters,
he was only staring at his watch.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.280
He can explain that as well. Listen…

10:48.240 --> 10:50.640
The face of the watch is black.

10:51.440 --> 10:55.480
So he had to look at it for a long time
in order to tell the time.

10:55.560 --> 10:58.040
-Right.
-So it was because of the darkness.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.240
So Engström was staring at his watch

11:01.320 --> 11:05.800
and didn't see the witness Björkman
or when Palme got shot.

11:11.080 --> 11:14.840
He also mentioned the witness
who mistook him for the murderer

11:15.440 --> 11:17.600
and said he was wearing a wrist bag.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.600
That would prove that he was at the scene.

11:20.680 --> 11:25.600
Yes, but the wrist bag
was first seen on David Bagares gata.

11:26.480 --> 11:30.800
That's where the witness
Yvonne Nieminen spots it.

11:31.640 --> 11:34.560
Nobody mentioned a wrist bag
at the murder scene.

11:35.280 --> 11:40.120
Also, Mårten Palme's description
of the man at Grand is very interesting.

11:40.200 --> 11:45.000
According to him,
a man outside Grand was staring at them.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.480
He described him as being 180 cm tall,

11:49.560 --> 11:54.000
wearing a blue quilted jacket,
and a cap with some kind of clasp…

11:54.920 --> 11:56.360
That sounds familiar.

11:56.440 --> 11:57.640
And…

11:58.720 --> 12:01.280
round wire-rimmed glasses.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.480
We should bring him in.

12:08.720 --> 12:09.680
We've got the suspect.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.120
-Who?
-He's being questioned.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.600
What did you think about Palme?

12:28.680 --> 12:29.680
Mixed feelings.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.320
You didn't like him, right?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.040
No.

12:34.800 --> 12:35.880
How certain is it?

12:39.440 --> 12:40.440
We'll see.

12:41.800 --> 12:45.920
You were sitting at the café Mon Chèri,
two blocks from the murder scene.

12:46.920 --> 12:48.840
You were speaking to some girls,

12:49.560 --> 12:52.240
and you said
some harsh things about Palme…

12:52.320 --> 12:55.080
That 33-year-old is a fucking nutjob.

12:55.160 --> 12:56.760
…that you wished him dead.

12:57.680 --> 13:00.680
He wished Palme dead,
hours before the murder.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.360
Isn't that right?

13:02.440 --> 13:04.280
And he was in the neighborhood.

13:22.240 --> 13:24.800
-They have a suspect.
-What?

13:24.880 --> 13:27.360
The Palme murder!
Gunhild went to buy Expressen.

13:39.360 --> 13:43.680
"The police won't reveal
any details about the suspect,

13:43.760 --> 13:46.360
but confirm that he has been questioned."

13:47.280 --> 13:50.080
"According to Expressen's sources,

13:50.160 --> 13:53.240
the man has expressed
hatred towards Palme."

13:54.320 --> 13:59.640
"During most of the night of the murder,
the man was close to Sveavägen."

14:01.360 --> 14:04.320
"The man comes from
the southern part of Sweden

14:04.400 --> 14:08.560
and has a connection
to the fascist organization EAP."

14:08.640 --> 14:10.120
PALME FOLLOWED DAY BEFORE MURDER

14:10.200 --> 14:11.760
33-YEAR-OLD SUSPECT IN THE PALME MURDER!

14:11.840 --> 14:13.560
Wouldn't it be nice if it was over?

14:15.360 --> 14:17.720
-It sounds as if it's him.
-Yes.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.040
Hi.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.880
We've found gunpowder residue
on the 33-year-old's jacket.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.440
And we have a new witness.

14:30.520 --> 14:34.960
A French guy who claims that Gunnarsson
tried to force his way into his car

14:35.040 --> 14:38.160
and escape from Brunkebergsåsen
just after the murder.

14:41.120 --> 14:44.760
How credible is
this French guy's testimony?

14:44.840 --> 14:47.280
He identified Gunnarsson in a photo.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.680
Come on, Hasse.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.840
A Palme hater
with gunpowder residue on his jacket

14:57.920 --> 15:01.520
who wants a quick ride
out of the area of the murder?

15:01.600 --> 15:03.600
I'm not looking for a lone nutjob.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.920
I'm looking for a conspiracy.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.400
A conspiracy?

15:32.240 --> 15:33.920
THE MURDER SUSPECT
IT WAS HERE HE MET PALME

15:34.000 --> 15:36.640
THE HATRED FORCED US TO MOVE TO THE USA

15:44.800 --> 15:46.200
"PALME OUGHT TO BE SHOT"

16:32.280 --> 16:36.120
THE FIGHT FOR PEACE TAKES COURAGE,
BUT PEACE IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR

16:36.200 --> 16:37.800
THANK YOU, OLOF
THE KURDS

16:37.880 --> 16:40.000
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE

16:40.080 --> 16:42.480
OLOF PALME, FOREVER IN OUR HEARTS
PERU

17:04.400 --> 17:06.840
It turns out one of our teams

17:06.920 --> 17:10.000
had shown the French guy
pictures of the 33-year-old,

17:10.080 --> 17:11.920
and he hadn't recognized him.

17:12.000 --> 17:17.040
But the following day, other investigators
showed him new photos of the 33-year-old

17:17.120 --> 17:20.560
not knowing
what had happened the day before.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.400
And that time,
he identified the 33-year-old.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.480
What the hell do you mean?

17:29.840 --> 17:34.440
The problem is
that we no longer know if the French guy

17:34.520 --> 17:39.200
only recognized him because he had
seen photos of him the day before, so…

17:40.120 --> 17:42.680
Then the French guy
is useless as a witness.

17:43.280 --> 17:45.080
-You realize that, right?
-Yes.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.600
What should I tell the press?

17:51.480 --> 17:54.960
They're down there waiting
for me to arrest the 33-year-old.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.080
But now I have to stand there
and say what?

17:58.640 --> 17:59.720
What should I say?

18:01.560 --> 18:04.400
Tell me what to say
because I don't fucking know.

18:13.800 --> 18:14.880
Here he comes.

18:21.880 --> 18:26.520
Welcome to yet another press conference.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.680
It'll be fairly short.

18:29.680 --> 18:32.040
Today we've decided to…

18:32.560 --> 18:36.240
release a person
who previously had been a suspect.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.720
That doesn't mean
that the investigation in any way…

18:41.880 --> 18:47.960
has lost momentum. On the contrary,
we are following several interesting leads

18:48.720 --> 18:51.560
at the same time
as new leads keep coming in.

18:52.600 --> 18:57.800
However, this particular person is,
as of today, no longer of interest.

18:57.880 --> 18:58.920
Thank you.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.880
The past weeks have shown

19:12.960 --> 19:17.520
that the ideas
Olof Palme ferociously fought for…

19:18.480 --> 19:23.560
remain strong
in the soul of the Swedish people.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.160
Through his passing,

19:28.240 --> 19:32.320
a Swedish voice
has been stilled in the entire world.

19:32.400 --> 19:36.800
A voice that spoke
of peace, freedom, and justice.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.840
The whole world will miss this voice.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.400
Which end is the right one?

19:46.400 --> 19:47.440
Engström.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.000
The guy from Skandia?

19:50.600 --> 19:53.200
Yes, that's right. Stig Engström.

19:53.280 --> 19:56.960
-His version doesn't make sense.
-A corpulent graphic designer?

19:59.760 --> 20:01.600
Does he have access to weapons?

20:02.520 --> 20:03.920
You never know.

20:04.520 --> 20:08.000
According to descriptions
of the perpetrator's clothing…

20:09.040 --> 20:11.720
They're in line with what he was wearing.

20:11.800 --> 20:12.840
Hey, Arne.

20:13.840 --> 20:16.320
This always happens in big investigations.

20:17.720 --> 20:19.520
You don't just find the perps.

20:20.480 --> 20:24.720
You also find a lot of nutjobs
who see their chance to get attention.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.360
Believe me. It happens all the time.

20:28.440 --> 20:30.160
We have to keep them in line

20:31.320 --> 20:33.200
so they don't take over.

20:35.640 --> 20:36.720
Do you understand?

20:39.560 --> 20:41.840
I felt it all along, in my gut.

20:42.520 --> 20:43.600
The 33-year-old…

20:45.360 --> 20:46.840
is not our guy.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.600
That mistake… I won't make that again.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.000
Leave a note.

21:57.480 --> 21:58.800
What the hell?

22:00.600 --> 22:02.200
I told you to leave a note!

22:03.360 --> 22:04.960
-Arne…
-Hello, there.

22:06.480 --> 22:09.840
-Do you miss working with the police?
-No, I don't know.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.000
Nobody dislikes me here.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.120
Goddamn…

22:20.000 --> 22:21.040
Arne…

22:22.160 --> 22:23.800
what if it is Engström?

22:23.880 --> 22:27.000
I can't figure out what he was doing
on the night of the murder.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.280
I don't even know if he was at the scene.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.800
He might even be the perpetrator.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.280
How well do you know Engström?

22:39.560 --> 22:41.440
Here everyone knows who he is.

22:42.640 --> 22:43.680
Or was.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.240
He's like…

22:47.440 --> 22:49.680
a star that's burned out.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.200
Could you do me a favor?

22:52.320 --> 22:56.080
Could you dig around
here at Skandia and see what…?

22:57.160 --> 22:59.160
What people think about Engström?

23:00.520 --> 23:01.640
What he's up to.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.880
You know, regular…

23:05.800 --> 23:07.240
decent police work.

23:16.440 --> 23:18.120
Stig Engström?

23:19.440 --> 23:21.120
Of course I remember him.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.360
I was his boss for many years.

23:26.160 --> 23:29.320
I assume that you'd
rather call him the Skandia Man.

23:31.240 --> 23:35.120
Do you remember if Stig
was part of any organization at Skandia?

23:35.760 --> 23:38.440
Yes, he was president of the social club.

23:39.360 --> 23:42.320
He was overly proud of that,

23:43.240 --> 23:45.600
until he was insufferable even there.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.240
I'm going to tell you what Stig was like.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.840
In the early '80s,

23:52.920 --> 23:55.600
we were looking for
a new head of advertising.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Stig thought that he
was going to get the position.

24:01.240 --> 24:05.560
He wasn't close to being considered,
so I brought him to my office to…

24:05.640 --> 24:07.440
clear up the misunderstanding.

24:09.840 --> 24:12.960
I liked Stig,
so I was very gentle with him.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.320
But Stig, he…

24:16.480 --> 24:18.640
changed and became like a…

24:19.800 --> 24:21.720
like a hurt child.

24:22.960 --> 24:25.480
His eyes went black with hatred, and he…

24:27.760 --> 24:29.320
started threatening me.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.800
It was unsettling. I realized
there was something wrong with him.

24:36.120 --> 24:38.400
He felt as if he'd been chosen.

24:39.400 --> 24:43.200
Just like he was dying
to be a part of the upper class in Täby.

24:45.480 --> 24:46.960
What happened in Täby?

24:49.080 --> 24:50.000
Well…

24:50.520 --> 24:54.520
He loved bragging about their titles.

24:55.960 --> 24:58.520
Everything had to be so damn fancy.

25:00.920 --> 25:01.920
Honey.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.720
Well, hello, there. Come in.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.200
-Hello.
-Punctual, as always.

25:07.280 --> 25:08.360
Yes.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.880
It was a lieutenant colonel and his wife.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.440
-Hello! Welcome.
-Hello.

25:13.520 --> 25:16.920
They often played at Stig's old friend's.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.080
-Brother.
-Welcome.

25:18.160 --> 25:20.360
That man was sort of the leader.

25:20.440 --> 25:21.840
I also brought my rapier.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.360
International affairs.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.840
He was wealthy, of course.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.360
But the real VIP
was the embassy counselor.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.760
Good of you to come.

25:32.840 --> 25:36.440
-Margareta, can I borrow you for a second?
-Yes, sure.

25:36.520 --> 25:38.600
-I wasn't sure…
-What?

25:38.680 --> 25:40.720
I haven't worn this dress before.

25:40.800 --> 25:44.080
I feel like I should've worn high heels.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.720
This was proper upper class.

25:46.800 --> 25:47.960
-Yes.
-Thank you.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.560
Täby was a stronghold for the Moderates,

25:50.640 --> 25:53.920
so this gang was, of course,
die-hard Palme haters.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.560
-How are you?
-Same old.

25:58.640 --> 26:02.160
So, how did Stig manage
to wiggle his way into this group?

26:04.040 --> 26:07.600
He was lucky.
It turned out that he was good at bridge.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.680
And this gang loved bridge.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.440
What about this one? No…

26:17.520 --> 26:19.000
That didn't do much good.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.560
Sonja.

26:23.640 --> 26:25.080
Do you have some…?

26:25.160 --> 26:27.120
Of course. Excuse me.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.880
-There you go.
-Thank you.

26:37.200 --> 26:38.400
Where were we?

26:40.440 --> 26:41.760
Not more than that.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.640
Dear friends!

26:47.080 --> 26:48.400
Let me show you…

26:49.800 --> 26:51.440
what I found.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.800
A business card.

26:54.560 --> 26:55.920
Do you recognize it?

26:56.000 --> 26:59.280
"Stig Engström.
Head of advertising at Skandia."

27:02.600 --> 27:06.320
-But you never got that job, did you?
-That was a long time ago.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.080
Why do you still have that card?

27:09.160 --> 27:11.800
I found it among the decks of cards,

27:11.880 --> 27:16.440
but I'm just wondering
why you'd order business cards

27:16.520 --> 27:19.560
before you knew you got the job.

27:19.640 --> 27:21.400
No, it wasn't like that at all.

27:21.480 --> 27:27.440
That's curious. Because I'm holding
a card that says "head of advertising."

27:27.520 --> 27:29.520
But you're a graphic designer.

27:29.600 --> 27:33.840
That position turned out
to be more administrative than creative,

27:33.920 --> 27:35.560
so it didn't suit me.

27:35.640 --> 27:39.440
-So I turned it down.
-You turned down a leadership position?

27:39.520 --> 27:41.120
At least you deserve a drink.

27:49.480 --> 27:52.920
I have a feeling
that you're going to turn me down.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.720
Make up your mind. Yes or no?

27:58.040 --> 27:59.080
What do you say?

28:02.800 --> 28:06.160
-Yes. Yes, please.
-That's good, Stig. Here you go.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.280
I'm just messing with you.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.080
You can keep this.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.320
-Is anyone else thirsty?
-Yes.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.640
-Anyone?
-I have a small spade.

28:21.720 --> 28:22.760
Yes, please.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.400
Let's see…

28:32.400 --> 28:34.760
Stig, why are you sitting here?

28:36.880 --> 28:38.160
Petronella.

28:39.240 --> 28:40.920
So you're at home after all?

28:41.480 --> 28:43.640
Yes, you know the rules.

28:43.720 --> 28:47.640
-If Mother and Father have guests…
-The children stay in their rooms.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.400
Are you smoking in secret?

28:51.480 --> 28:52.520
No.

28:53.680 --> 28:55.120
I'm just taking a break.

28:59.640 --> 29:00.760
A break from Dad?

29:05.000 --> 29:07.720
I was driving my taxi.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.120
He was lying in the recovery position.

29:10.200 --> 29:13.520
When I got a green light,
I heard the first shot.

29:13.600 --> 29:16.160
They wanted to know who was at the scene.

29:16.240 --> 29:21.280
Lisbeth said, "Don't you recognize me?
I'm Lisbeth Palme. My Olof has been shot."

29:31.160 --> 29:32.200
Stig?

29:33.680 --> 29:35.120
Aren't you at Sveavägen?

29:36.000 --> 29:39.240
-What?
-The police are doing the reconstruction.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.560
-Today?
-Yes.

29:40.640 --> 29:43.040
They've closed off Sveavägen. There's…

29:43.600 --> 29:45.800
police and witnesses everywhere.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.320
Haven't they called you?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.440
You're a witness, right?

29:59.560 --> 30:00.720
-Stig!
-What?

30:01.920 --> 30:03.960
What are you, if not a witness?

30:06.560 --> 30:09.800
I'll… I'll contact them. Thank you.

30:09.880 --> 30:11.280
Thank you for telling me.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.520
My name is Stig Engström.

30:50.600 --> 30:54.000
I'd like to speak to Rapport's editor,
Folke Rydén.

30:56.960 --> 31:01.960
No, at that point,
none of us knew it was Olof Palme.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.840
The investigation hadn't intensified yet…

31:07.520 --> 31:11.480
so they were more than happy
with the witnesses they already had.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.320
-The police had no interest in you?
-No.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.160
-Despite what you had to say?
-No.

31:18.240 --> 31:21.480
And you wanted to say
that you were being described?

31:22.000 --> 31:25.800
Yes, it was disinterest all the way.

31:27.040 --> 31:31.120
The police have conducted several
reconstructions of the Palme murder.

31:31.880 --> 31:33.560
The area was closed off.

31:33.640 --> 31:35.480
Some ten-odd witnesses were called in,

31:36.080 --> 31:39.200
but Stig Engström,
one of the first ones on the scene,

31:39.280 --> 31:40.360
was not called in.

31:42.480 --> 31:45.160
Say that you're trying to do a puzzle…

31:45.800 --> 31:49.600
and try to remove the pieces
that aren't a part of the puzzle,

31:50.200 --> 31:54.000
you shouldn't remove the pieces
that you know are a part of it.

31:55.680 --> 31:59.200
So, maybe the police
aren't very good at puzzles.

32:01.240 --> 32:06.400
Skandia is located on Sveavägen,
50 meters from where Palme was murdered.

32:06.480 --> 32:09.240
That's the first time
you ran without limping.

32:09.320 --> 32:13.360
…February 28th,
Stig Engström left his office at Skandia

32:13.440 --> 32:17.320
to catch the last subway home.
He was in a hurry.

32:24.880 --> 32:27.880
ADVERTISING CONSULTANT

33:06.960 --> 33:08.960
"I WAS MISTAKEN FOR THE MURDERER"

33:09.040 --> 33:14.080
-And that was the first time you saw him?
-Yes, he left for dinner around eight.

33:19.280 --> 33:22.080
-Are you going home?
-I'm just going for dinner.

33:27.360 --> 33:29.520
So Engström went out to eat?

33:30.720 --> 33:32.120
When did he come back?

33:32.200 --> 33:33.560
Sometime after nine.

33:33.640 --> 33:36.360
But it's more likely he went out to drink.

33:41.280 --> 33:42.320
Are you full now?

33:50.040 --> 33:53.840
-And then you see him when he clocks out.
-Yes, at 11:19 p.m.

33:53.920 --> 33:54.960
Then what?

33:55.640 --> 33:58.480
Well, what was it, 20 minutes later?

33:59.960 --> 34:03.120
He came back,
and he was upset, to say the least.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.320
I mean, really fucking upset.

34:08.120 --> 34:10.440
We talked about it afterwards.

34:11.880 --> 34:15.960
It would be tough to see Palme get shot,
but this was more than shock.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.200
As if he had been shot at too.

34:52.280 --> 34:55.040
Engström went out to eat around eight.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.960
He returned to Skandia
after Palme's film had started.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.040
So Engström knew
the Palmes were at the movies

35:02.120 --> 35:04.600
simply because he saw them go in.

35:04.680 --> 35:05.720
Exactly.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.960
And he's lying about an important detail.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.280
The time he clocked out.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.560
-At 11:21 p.m.
-According to him.

35:13.640 --> 35:16.960
In reality, he went out at 11:19 p.m.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.480
But he's smart enough to not mention that.

35:20.560 --> 35:25.080
The less time he spent on Sveavägen,
the less likely it is that he shot Palme.

35:25.160 --> 35:28.120
Engström must've seen
the Palme couple three times.

35:29.200 --> 35:32.120
The first time
just before the movie started.

35:33.440 --> 35:35.240
Engström was out to eat dinner

35:35.320 --> 35:38.600
and happened to see
the Palme couple enter Grand.

35:39.200 --> 35:42.560
The second time after the movie,
at eleven o'clock.

35:44.040 --> 35:46.240
Then Engström stands outside Grand.

35:47.120 --> 35:49.320
That's when Mårten Palme sees him.

35:50.480 --> 35:54.360
The third time was when he clocked out
and ran into Palme…

35:56.920 --> 35:58.080
and shot him.

36:00.960 --> 36:05.680
But how can Engström stand
outside Grand at eleven o'clock

36:05.760 --> 36:10.440
when the security personnel swear
that he came back to Skandia at nine?

36:11.080 --> 36:14.800
And they then didn't see him
until he clocked out at 11:19 p.m.?

36:16.280 --> 36:18.200
He must've gone out again.

36:19.640 --> 36:20.680
How?

36:22.800 --> 36:25.120
That's the decisive question, isn't it?

36:26.600 --> 36:29.440
How could Engström stand outside Grand…

36:30.800 --> 36:32.240
at eleven o'clock?

36:34.640 --> 36:37.840
-Can you please fill out these forms?
-No!

36:37.920 --> 36:41.000
-Please, Stig, it'll be quick.
-I refuse.

36:41.640 --> 36:44.560
-It's the same for everyone. It--
-No!

36:44.640 --> 36:47.120
What's wrong with you? This-- Get a grip.

36:47.200 --> 36:50.400
-It's to give management insight into--
-I refuse!

36:50.480 --> 36:51.760
Get a grip!

36:54.320 --> 36:55.480
Yes, Engström.

36:55.560 --> 36:59.040
My name is Arne Irvell.
I'm calling from the police station.

36:59.560 --> 37:02.960
-Regarding the Palme investigation.
-Okay?

37:03.040 --> 37:04.680
We need to speak to you.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.560
Again?

37:07.640 --> 37:12.720
Yes, unfortunately. This time you need to
come to us so that we can tape everything.

37:13.440 --> 37:17.760
-I suggest tomorrow at ten.
-Yes, okay.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.840
If it's necessary then…

37:19.920 --> 37:23.840
Yes, and wear the clothes
that you wore on the night of the murder.

37:25.360 --> 37:27.480
We need it for the photo, you see.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.640
Sure, of course.

37:30.720 --> 37:33.360
Good, see you tomorrow at ten.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.200
Yes. Thank you.

37:58.080 --> 38:01.000
Didn't they want you
to wear the same clothes?

38:04.360 --> 38:05.680
See you later.

38:49.560 --> 38:53.120
Hello. Arne Irvell, chief inspector.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.600
Yes, Stig Engström.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.680
-I called earlier.
-Yes.

38:56.760 --> 38:57.840
-Welcome.
-Thanks.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.760
Thanks for stopping by.

38:59.840 --> 39:04.680
I'll leave you with my colleagues,
but I wanted to come down and say hi.

39:05.240 --> 39:06.280
Well, this way.

39:22.320 --> 39:27.360
So this night, February 28th,
you were working late at Skandia.

39:28.480 --> 39:33.480
Yes, I had to finish some things
before going on a ski trip with my wife.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.800
What about earlier that evening?

39:36.560 --> 39:38.560
You mean that same evening?

39:38.640 --> 39:40.840
I was in my office.

39:42.080 --> 39:45.240
You didn't leave the building at all?

39:45.760 --> 39:46.800
No.

39:57.120 --> 40:00.200
You didn't connect the blast
with Palme laying there?

40:00.960 --> 40:05.240
No, it took a few seconds.
His face was quite bloody.

40:07.880 --> 40:12.040
I was trying to put the person,
who turned out to be Olof Palme,

40:12.120 --> 40:17.480
in the recovery position
so that the blood would flow out.

40:18.040 --> 40:21.440
My first thought was that…

40:22.320 --> 40:25.480
some drug gangs were settling things.

40:30.760 --> 40:33.000
What did you see around you?

40:34.880 --> 40:40.320
A young girl on my left, and a guy…

40:41.840 --> 40:42.800
on my right.

40:43.480 --> 40:48.040
When I looked up towards Luntmakargatan,

40:48.680 --> 40:50.400
I saw a person's silhouette.

40:50.480 --> 40:52.080
He stood very still.

40:52.160 --> 40:56.880
He stood surprisingly still
for about five or six…

40:56.960 --> 40:58.160
-This…
-…seconds.

40:58.240 --> 40:59.480
…silhouette?

40:59.560 --> 41:02.880
-It was a younger person.
-Can you describe that person?

41:03.480 --> 41:06.800
There was something
relatively puffy around the torso.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.720
Let's go back to what Lisbeth Palme said
about also being shot.

41:14.400 --> 41:17.960
Yes, she repeated that a few times.

41:18.560 --> 41:22.520
She said, "They have shot me too."

41:23.880 --> 41:27.360
Later she said,
"They have shot me in the back."

41:27.440 --> 41:31.440
Is that what she said? Did she say "they"?

41:31.520 --> 41:35.600
Yes. "They have shot me too.
They have shot me in the back."

41:39.360 --> 41:42.960
Okay, Stig.
We're going to show you a few pictures.

42:09.160 --> 42:12.440
He identified Lars Jeppsson
and Anders Björkman,

42:12.520 --> 42:15.840
the only witnesses
the perpetrator would've seen.

42:17.000 --> 42:22.120
Yes, and he totally mixed up Anna Hage,
the young woman who gave Palme first aid.

42:22.880 --> 42:26.200
Instead he identified her friend,
Karin Johansson.

42:26.280 --> 42:29.760
Probably because Karin Johansson
has been all over the press.

42:29.840 --> 42:32.040
Anna Hage has kept out of it.

43:05.800 --> 43:06.800
Leave a note!

43:34.080 --> 43:35.160
What the hell?

43:36.160 --> 43:41.240
-Why the hell didn't you say this earlier?
-You didn't ask, so… yeah.

43:43.440 --> 43:46.040
The alarm sounded
on the night of the murder?

43:46.120 --> 43:47.400
-Yes.
-From when?

43:47.920 --> 43:52.200
From… Wait, let me…

43:54.080 --> 43:56.760
Between 10:35 p.m. and 11:22 p.m.

43:56.840 --> 43:58.200
And then I locked it.

43:58.840 --> 44:02.480
So someone could've used this door
without you noticing?

44:03.400 --> 44:04.240
Yes.

44:14.600 --> 44:15.640
Shit.

44:27.040 --> 44:29.600
Based on the book The Unlikely Murderer
by Thomas Pettersson.

44:29.680 --> 44:32.280
It has not been proved
that Stig Engström murdered Olof Palme,

44:32.360 --> 44:35.080
but the Swedish police
and Prosecution Authority suspect him.
