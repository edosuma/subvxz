THE TIME MACHINE

02:16.038 --> 02:18.398
Aren't you
Forgetting something?

02:18.583 --> 02:22.583
I know. It's something to do with
The third differential coefficient.

02:22.797 --> 02:25.196
- Not that, Tonight,
- What?

02:25.341 --> 02:27.740
Emma?

02:27.927 --> 02:30.887
- What time is it?
- Almost 5:00,

02:31.097 --> 02:33.496
Oh, God.

02:42.403 --> 02:45.562
My proposal for utilizing
Solar power, rejected,

02:45.781 --> 02:48.660
My concepts for harnessing
Micro-energy waves, rejected,

02:48.867 --> 02:52.667
The dean suggests that I focus on
Something that might actually help mankind,

02:52.914 --> 02:54.914
Like his study on the benefits
Of tobacco consumption,

02:55.041 --> 02:58.561
Alex, the problem is
Your ideas are a bit too... radical,

02:58.796 --> 03:01.476
The problem is with
The faculty. They're dinosaurs.

03:01.674 --> 03:03.793
They're already extinct;
they just don't know it.

03:03.968 --> 03:07.808
They'll be discovered by some future archaeologist,
And he won't know what to make of them.

03:08.056 --> 03:10.296
Their dim little eyes,
Devoid of any curiosity--

03:10.434 --> 03:12.713
Alex, it's your first year
As associate professor.

03:12.853 --> 03:15.973
You might want to play things
A little more conservatively.

03:16.190 --> 03:18.470
You sound just like my father.

03:18.651 --> 03:22.291
Look at them, Philby. All alike.
All in identical bowler hats.

03:22.531 --> 03:24.651
Do you want your students
To turn out like that?

03:24.825 --> 03:28.545
I want my students prepared
For the realities of the world
They're about to greet.

03:28.746 --> 03:32.985
Well, I don't. I want them to run along
This street and knock off every bowler they see.

03:36.171 --> 03:38.130
Mrs. Watch it!

03:38.257 --> 03:40.457
Oh, huzzah, the master's home.

03:40.635 --> 03:42.474
- Did you get it?
- Hello, Mr. Philby.

03:42.596 --> 03:45.155
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.
You're looking in the pink.

03:45.349 --> 03:48.588
Must be all the exercise I get scampering
Up and down these stairs like a wee lad.

03:48.811 --> 03:50.730
- Don't torture me. Did you get it?
- I got it.

03:50.896 --> 03:53.215
- Good. Let me see.
- But don't you think for one moment...

03:53.399 --> 03:55.959
I'm going to let you go out
In that filthy jacket.

03:56.111 --> 03:59.550
Now, go in there and change.

04:05.205 --> 04:08.924
And you've got another letter
From that annoying little man.

04:09.125 --> 04:12.404
Well, go ahead,
Switch it on,

04:12.630 --> 04:16.949
- It'll help people keep
Their teeth well into their 40s,

04:17.218 --> 04:20.817
- You might think about having that cleaned.
- Oh, who has the time?

04:21.055 --> 04:24.255
- How did you know with Molly?
- Know what?

04:24.477 --> 04:28.436
- You were meant to be together.
- She made the best
Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.

04:28.690 --> 04:30.569
Don't you have a single
Romantic bone in your body?

04:30.733 --> 04:34.452
No. I'm all bowler hat.

04:37.283 --> 04:40.481
Why do you waste your time
On that crack pot?

04:40.661 --> 04:43.060
Because he has some
Very interesting ideas.

04:43.205 --> 04:47.004
A professor at Columbia should not be
Corresponding with a crazy German bookkeeper.

04:47.253 --> 04:49.333
He's a patent clerk,
Not a bookkeeper.

04:49.504 --> 04:53.184
I think Mr. Einstein deserves
All the support I can give him.

04:53.384 --> 04:56.263
I wonder if we'll ever
Go too far?

04:56.471 --> 04:58.351
- With what?
- With this.

04:58.514 --> 05:01.434
With all of this.

05:01.643 --> 05:03.682
No such thing.

05:06.524 --> 05:08.963
All right. How do I look?

05:09.152 --> 05:11.912
Practically decent. Really, Alex.
Good luck tonight.

05:12.113 --> 05:15.153
She's a fine girl. She's done
Wonderful things for you.

05:15.368 --> 05:19.008
Don't worry. You still have that
Alluring smell of chalk.

05:19.205 --> 05:22.165
Oh, got to hurry.

05:22.375 --> 05:26.374
Now, that's more like it.
You look a proper gentleman for once.

05:26.631 --> 05:29.030
Well, you better hope so. If Emma
Turns me down, you'll be next.

05:29.216 --> 05:32.337
- Oh, I'm already swooning.

05:32.512 --> 05:35.752
All right. Wish me luck.

05:40.729 --> 05:42.609
Thank you.

05:50.741 --> 05:54.820
Fresh flowers. Fresh flowers.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.401
- Have some flowers, sir.
- Not tonight, thanks.

06:01.544 --> 06:04.744
No. I promised her flowers.

06:13.810 --> 06:15.649
Spectacular.

06:15.812 --> 06:19.491
Spectacular waste of money.
Damn thing's always breaking down.

06:19.731 --> 06:22.211
- Do you need a lift?
-Yes, yes.

06:22.402 --> 06:25.601
- How do you keep
The water temperature stable?
- There's a cantilevered gasket...

06:25.823 --> 06:28.023
- on the fuel regulator--

06:28.200 --> 06:31.120
Oh, God. Uh--

06:31.288 --> 06:35.127
Much obliged.
I'm always forgetting the damn brake.

06:35.376 --> 06:39.055
Hop in. I'll give you a perambulation
Before it breaks down again.

06:39.297 --> 06:42.297
Oh, uh, I'm afraid
I have a prior engagement.

06:42.509 --> 06:45.068
Well, another time then.
We perambulate here most every night.

06:45.262 --> 06:46.862
Certainly.

06:49.433 --> 06:53.232
- Get a horse!

06:53.479 --> 06:55.398
Yes.

07:29.061 --> 07:31.221
Alexander?

07:39.113 --> 07:41.954
- Oh! Whoa.

07:42.159 --> 07:47.518
- You're late, Professor.
- I got here as soon as I could.

07:47.832 --> 07:52.071
Well, they say it's all the rage
in Paris. But I just picked it up--

07:52.338 --> 07:57.457
- Five dollars at Macy's.
Silly, isn't it?
- Very silly. I like it.

07:57.719 --> 08:01.199
Well, where are they?

08:01.390 --> 08:03.590
- What?
- The flowers.

08:03.726 --> 08:06.006
You promised me flowers tonight.
Don't you even remember?

08:06.187 --> 08:09.346
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-- Well, I was distracted.

08:09.525 --> 08:11.804
Well, there's something new.

08:11.943 --> 08:15.422
- Uh, Emma, I need to talk to you.

08:23.081 --> 08:27.521
-Oh, uh, shall we walk through the park?
-Yes.

08:32.009 --> 08:35.847
Professor, you're shivering. I hope
you're not coming down with something.

08:37.931 --> 08:40.451
Well, I'm afraid I am.

08:40.642 --> 08:45.362
I'm not sleeping very well, and even
When I'm awake, I'm not much use.

08:45.607 --> 08:49.446
I can't eat or think
Or do much of any thing anymore.

08:51.780 --> 08:55.780
And the worst part is,
I don't know that I'll ever be well.

08:56.036 --> 09:00.355
I think there's only one remedy,
And that's for you to marry me...

09:00.624 --> 09:05.264
- And spend the rest
Of your life with me.

09:08.091 --> 09:12.050
Oh, Emma, I know it's right.
I know we're meant to be together.

09:12.262 --> 09:16.222
It's the only thing in my entire life
I've never had to think about.

09:16.433 --> 09:18.473
Oh, Alex.

09:20.271 --> 09:23.031
Uh-Uh, wait.
I have something for you.

09:29.240 --> 09:33.239
You know,
The moment is rather dying here.

09:33.495 --> 09:36.174
I-I know.
Hold on. Oh.

09:47.009 --> 09:50.209
- I know it's not a diamond.
- A moonstone.

09:50.430 --> 09:53.270
Well, it's your birthstone.
I thought--

09:53.476 --> 09:56.195
You thought right.

10:06.699 --> 10:10.018
I just might cry,

10:10.245 --> 10:14.084
I couldn't help but overhear.

10:14.333 --> 10:19.932
Two fine young people starting out
On the road of life.

10:20.214 --> 10:22.493
- I wish you the very best.

10:22.675 --> 10:26.074
- Well, thank you.
- And as much as I hate to do this--

10:26.306 --> 10:30.785
Moved as I am by your...
Protestations of love--

10:31.059 --> 10:34.180
I'll need your money now.

10:34.397 --> 10:37.356
- Sir?
- And your jewelry too.

10:37.567 --> 10:41.966
I guess we could cal this your first little bump
On the road to marital bliss.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.759
- I don't understand--
- Don't make a scene. There's no cause for that.

10:45.994 --> 10:49.193
-Just give me your wallet, will you?
- Hmm?

10:50.915 --> 10:52.755
Did you hear me, lad?

10:52.877 --> 10:56.596
Uh, all right, all right.
Here. That's everything.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.990
And your watch.

11:04.513 --> 11:07.113
And the gloves.

11:12.148 --> 11:15.947
- And the ring.
- No.

11:16.194 --> 11:18.993
I'm afraid so, darling.

11:19.198 --> 11:24.077
- And maybe he'll
Buy you a diamond now.
- Please, please. Not that.

11:24.371 --> 11:26.771
Don't!

11:36.468 --> 11:40.988
Why did you do that?
It's only a ring.

11:45.977 --> 11:47.618
Emma?

11:56.156 --> 11:59.196
Emma?

11:59.410 --> 12:02.290
Oh!

12:39.164 --> 12:42.683
- What?

12:49.634 --> 12:55.073
Oh. Oh, sir,
Mr. Philby's here.

12:55.390 --> 12:58.550
- Here?
- Yes, sir, He insisted on coming--

12:58.729 --> 13:03.048
- Tell him to go away, I'm busy,
- I won't go away, Alex.

13:04.902 --> 13:08.101
My God.
What's happened to you?

13:10.157 --> 13:12.836
I've been--
I've been working.

13:13.036 --> 13:16.516
You remember that?
You used to care about your work.

13:16.749 --> 13:20.268
I care more about my life.
And yours.

13:20.503 --> 13:22.902
I came by the house every day
After the funeral...

13:23.047 --> 13:25.846
And every week
And every other month.

13:26.051 --> 13:30.051
Then I stopped coming.
Did you even notice?

13:30.264 --> 13:34.823
- It hurt me, Alex... very much.
- Then why are you here now?

13:35.103 --> 13:38.382
- There are some things I have to
Say you may not like hearing--
- I know. I know.

13:38.606 --> 13:42.405
You're concerned. I know.
I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.

13:42.654 --> 13:46.213
But really...
I need you to go.

13:46.448 --> 13:49.128
- I won't leave. Not with
You hiding down here.
- I'm not hiding.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.635
Alex, will you please
Stand still and look at me!

13:59.047 --> 14:02.607
It wasn't your fault.

14:04.886 --> 14:09.526
No. It wasn't my fault.

14:09.809 --> 14:15.128
Maybe we should blame Mrs. Watchit for
picking up the ring from the jeweler.

14:15.441 --> 14:18.561
Or the jeweler for making it.

14:18.777 --> 14:23.577
Or the poor bastard who tore
The stone from the earth.

14:23.825 --> 14:28.024
Maybe I should blame you
For introducing me to Emma
In the first place. Yes.

14:28.288 --> 14:32.848
Alexander, nothing will
Ever change what happened.

14:33.127 --> 14:38.246
No, you're wrong,
Because I will change it.

14:38.507 --> 14:42.507
David, I appreciate
Your concern. I do.

14:42.764 --> 14:45.763
But I ask you to have faith in me.

14:45.975 --> 14:49.014
Well, I-I want to have
Faith in you, Alex, but--

14:49.188 --> 14:53.267
What-- What are--
What are you doing here?

14:53.524 --> 14:58.284
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you come by for dinner
In a week, and I'll show you?

14:58.572 --> 15:02.771
- Why don't you come home
With me now? Molly--
- Did you not hear me, David?

15:04.747 --> 15:07.586
I can't leave
When I'm so close.

15:10.127 --> 15:13.327
All right. We'll continue
This conversation in a week.

15:19.388 --> 15:22.548
In a week, we'll never even
Have had this conversation.

18:33.108 --> 18:36.107
Ah. Thank you, my good man.

19:00.807 --> 19:04.647
You're early.
That's a first.

19:04.895 --> 19:08.775
I wanted to see you.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.302
Well, where are they?

19:11.485 --> 19:15.685
- What?
- The flowers.

19:17.450 --> 19:20.650
You promised me flowers tonight.
Don't you even remember?

19:32.300 --> 19:36.340
You never cease
to surprise me.

19:41.394 --> 19:44.834
Emma, I need to talk to you.

19:45.065 --> 19:48.344
- Shall we walk through the park?
- No!

19:48.527 --> 19:50.807
No,

19:52.614 --> 19:56.254
No. Let's go into the city.

19:56.495 --> 19:59.055
- Alex, what is it?
- Nothing. Let's just hurry.

19:59.206 --> 20:03.966
Running along is all very well for you.
You're not wearing a corset.

20:08.341 --> 20:11.181
-Bleecker Street, and be quick about it.

20:35.955 --> 20:38.355
Now you're all gallant.

20:46.218 --> 20:50.858
Professor, you're shivering. I hope
You're not coming down with something.

20:51.099 --> 20:55.497
No, no. I'm fine.

20:55.730 --> 21:00.329
I'm wonderful. I'm walking down
The street with you again.

21:00.610 --> 21:03.290
But we took a walk
Three days ago.

21:03.488 --> 21:08.007
Well, not like this.
Never like this.

21:08.285 --> 21:12.524
- Heavens, look at that car.
- Oh, I've seen it.

21:12.791 --> 21:17.430
Now I know you're ill. You're passing up
The chance to explore some new gadget.

21:17.711 --> 21:22.351
- It's only a machine.
- Alexander, tell me what's going on.

21:22.592 --> 21:26.311
- Is something wrong?
- No.

21:26.556 --> 21:29.435
No.
Emma, listen to me.

21:29.642 --> 21:32.881
I need to leave you now, but I want you
to go straight home and stay there.

21:33.105 --> 21:37.744
I promise you I'll come by sometime later tonight,
And I won't make any sense.

21:37.986 --> 21:41.185
I'll be all upset that you didn't meet
Me in the park, but you must trust me.

21:41.407 --> 21:44.286
Everything will be all right.

21:45.910 --> 21:50.510
Just know how much I love you,
How much I'll always love you.

21:56.506 --> 21:59.826
All right.

22:00.051 --> 22:03.371
But first, where are my flowers?

22:08.519 --> 22:12.119
- Flowers it is.

22:12.358 --> 22:14.557
Wait right there.
Don't move.

22:24.623 --> 22:27.942
- Oh, can I help you, sir?
- Yes, a dozen roses. White.

22:28.167 --> 22:30.007
- No, no. Red.
- Look out!

22:50.902 --> 22:55.061
- Easy. Easy.

23:17.765 --> 23:21.125
I'm looking for
Professor Hartdegen.

23:28.111 --> 23:32.070
Alex, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

23:33.616 --> 23:37.577
- This was not supposed to happen.
- Of course not.

23:39.708 --> 23:43.547
- I know there's nothing I can say.
- We were out of the park, Philby.

23:43.755 --> 23:46.034
We were safe.

23:48.925 --> 23:51.765
Why can't I change it?

23:55.559 --> 23:58.758
I could come back
A thousand times.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.818
See her die a thousand ways.

24:04.234 --> 24:07.274
I don't--
I don't understand.

24:07.488 --> 24:10.687
I can't find the answer here.

24:12.703 --> 24:15.103
Not here.

24:21.505 --> 24:24.065
Not now.

27:47.322 --> 27:51.042
The future is now.

27:51.243 --> 27:54.003
Certain restrictions apply.
Blackout periods on availability

Hi, friends, the latest update
From Lunar Leisure Living,

Golfing on our championship course,
Home of the Neil Armstrong Open.

- Hello.

28:45.472 --> 28:47.272
Nice suit.

28:47.432 --> 28:50.272
Very retro.

28:50.477 --> 28:52.356
Thank you.

28:55.482 --> 28:58.522
Bet that makes
A hell of a cappuccino,

29:00.281 --> 29:02.280
That thing.

29:05.286 --> 29:06.886
I'll see you.

29:06.996 --> 29:10.635
Hi, friends. The latest update
From Lunar Leisure Living.

29:10.834 --> 29:14.114
Our engineers are currently preparing
For the first 20-megaton detonation...

29:14.337 --> 29:17.617
To create the subterranean living
Chambers for Lunar Leisure Living,

29:42.328 --> 29:45.247
- Alright,
Attention, everyone,

29:45.457 --> 29:49.096
Class 23, could we gather, please?
Our next stop is Antiquities.

29:49.336 --> 29:52.175
Please make sure that your micro scans
Are charged for download.

29:52.380 --> 29:55.220
- Two by two. Let's look lively.
Two by two.
- Stop! Quit!

29:55.426 --> 29:59.785
Tommy, if you do that again,
I will re-sequence your D.N.A.,
So help me! Now, march.

30:00.058 --> 30:02.937
March, March,
Two by two, please, look lively,

30:12.570 --> 30:17.210
Welcome to Vox System,
How may I help you?

30:17.493 --> 30:20.292
I didn't see you there.

30:20.497 --> 30:23.336
I always seem to have that effect.
How may I help you, sir?

30:25.586 --> 30:29.425
- What is that thing?
- That is my photonic memory core,

30:29.674 --> 30:31.873
Or P.M.C.,
As we say in the trade.

30:43.815 --> 30:46.655
Over here, sir.

30:49.445 --> 30:51.285
What are you?

30:51.448 --> 30:56.247
I'm the Fifth Avenue
Public Library information
Unit, Vox registration NY-114.

30:56.538 --> 30:58.697
How may I help you?

30:58.875 --> 31:04.074
- A stereopticon of some sort.
- Stereopticon? Oh, no, sir,

31:04.379 --> 31:06.459
I am a third-generation,
Fusion-powered photonic,

31:06.632 --> 31:09.472
With verbal and visual link capabilities
Connected to every database...

31:09.678 --> 31:13.197
On the planet,

31:13.431 --> 31:15.471
Photonic?

31:15.642 --> 31:19.802
A compendium
of all human knowledge.

31:20.064 --> 31:24.384
- Oh.
- Area of inquiry?

31:24.652 --> 31:28.012
- Do you know anything about physics?
- Ah, accessing physics.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.999
Mechanical engineering.

31:31.160 --> 31:33.959
Dimensional optics.
Chronography.

31:34.163 --> 31:38.602
Temporal causality,
Temporal paradox.

31:38.877 --> 31:40.996
- Time travel?
- Yes.

31:41.130 --> 31:43.650
Accessing science fiction.

31:43.842 --> 31:48.601
No, no. Practical application.
My question is why can't
One change the past?

31:50.806 --> 31:54.487
Because one cannot travel
into the past.

31:58.524 --> 32:01.404
- What-What if one could?
- One can not.

32:01.612 --> 32:05.292
Excuse me, this is something
You should trust me on.

32:05.491 --> 32:08.371
Accessing the writings
Of Isaac Asimov, H.G. Wells,

32:08.577 --> 32:10.697
Harlan Elison,
Alexander Hartdegen--

32:10.872 --> 32:14.792
- Tel me about him.
- Alexander Hartdegen, 1869 to 1903,

32:15.001 --> 32:17.801
American scientist
Given to eccentric postulation.

32:18.005 --> 32:21.164
Found writings include treatise
On the creation of a time machine.

32:21.385 --> 32:24.984
- Tel me about the time machine.
- Time Machine was written by H.G. Wells in 1894.

32:25.221 --> 32:28.980
It was a motion picture by
George Pal and a stage musical
by Andrew Lloyd Webber--

32:29.184 --> 32:32.304
- That's not what I mean.
- Would you like to hear
Selections from the score?

32:32.522 --> 32:36.122
- No.
- There's a place called tomorrow

32:36.359 --> 32:39.639
A place of joy
Not of sorrow

32:39.863 --> 32:42.703
Can't you see
It's a place for you and--

32:42.867 --> 32:45.346
Thank you.
That's quite enough.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.600
Will there be anything else?

32:49.749 --> 32:52.949
Uh, no. No, I think I'll have better
Luck in a few hundred years.

32:53.171 --> 32:56.050
Live long and prosper.

33:43.811 --> 33:47.010
Sir, where is your
designated evacuation center?

33:47.232 --> 33:49.191
Sir, you are subject
To arrest under martial law--

33:49.317 --> 33:51.637
Please put your hands out,
Palms together.

33:51.779 --> 33:54.298
You will be held in detention until your
Evacuation center clears you for transport.

33:54.491 --> 33:56.970
- Wait, wait!
-Just take it easy.

33:57.118 --> 34:00.837
- Hey, we got to get out of here!
- Wait. How did this happen?

34:01.039 --> 34:03.758
The moon. Come on.
Move it.

34:03.960 --> 34:09.078
- That's impossible, what happened?
- You been living under a rock?

34:09.340 --> 34:12.460
Yes, I've been living
Under a rock. Now, tell me.

34:14.929 --> 34:17.609
The demolitions for the lunar colonies
Screwed up the orbit, okay?

34:17.808 --> 34:21.608
The moon's breaking up.
All right? Come on.

34:24.984 --> 34:28.703
- Hey! Forget him! Come on!

36:35.340 --> 36:37.740
Emma?

37:06.876 --> 37:09.275
Shh!

38:10.574 --> 38:13.573
Hello?

38:48.157 --> 38:50.797
Hello.

38:50.995 --> 38:54.315
- Don't be afraid.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.701
Oh, wait.
Don't-- Don't go.

39:26.368 --> 39:30.447
Wait. I just want to talk to you.

40:03.243 --> 40:07.922
- Hello.

40:08.207 --> 40:11.886
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't understand you.

40:12.086 --> 40:14.406
- Do you know my words?
- Yes.

40:19.554 --> 40:22.993
The lex,
The stone language.

40:23.224 --> 40:26.783
The stone language? But do you
Understand me? Do you understand me?

40:27.021 --> 40:29.900
We all learn it
When we're young,

40:30.107 --> 40:33.666
They tor'jen,
Forget. They forget it.

40:33.903 --> 40:36.502
- But I teach,

40:47.084 --> 40:50.404
- What is he saying?
- They're trying to decide if we
Should throw you in the river.

40:50.630 --> 40:55.029
Tel me quickly, and tell me the truth.
Where do you come from?

40:57.471 --> 41:00.871
Well, actually, I'm from here.
Uh, just not from now.

41:01.099 --> 41:06.259
You see, I built a machine that allows
Me to travel through time.

41:06.565 --> 41:09.245
I'm from the past.

41:09.443 --> 41:11.203
Oh.

41:29.466 --> 41:31.706
I told them you hit your head...

41:31.844 --> 41:35.484
And you are a wandering idiot.

41:50.447 --> 41:53.647
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready for the moor,

41:53.868 --> 41:58.867
- The night.
- Oh. I'll come with you.

42:20.065 --> 42:23.705
- Eloi?
- What are your people named?

42:23.902 --> 42:28.061
Well, I-I guess
You'd call us New Yorkers.

42:28.325 --> 42:31.604
New Yorkers.
Are they friendly?

42:31.829 --> 42:34.869
Until you talk to them.

42:37.042 --> 42:41.682
- Tell me about your village.
- It's a very busy place.

42:41.923 --> 42:45.522
Everyone seems to be in a hurry.
And they all wear identical bowler hats.

42:47.055 --> 42:49.535
Little black round things
On their heads.

42:49.724 --> 42:54.444
- What do you do there?
- Well, I was a teacher like Mara.

42:54.730 --> 42:57.729
- And I make things,
- Me also,

43:03.156 --> 43:04.877
A sess'quin'tan?

43:05.033 --> 43:08.552
Mara, der'enjen'wen len?

43:08.745 --> 43:13.384
Sess'quin'tan,
Steps of rope.

43:13.626 --> 43:16.626
Oh, a rope ladder.

43:16.838 --> 43:18.918
We can make one.
I will teach you.

43:22.052 --> 43:25.252
Will you tell me more lon'el
On the next day?

43:25.473 --> 43:28.513
Tomorrow?
Yes, I will.

43:28.727 --> 43:32.087
Why don't you take care
Of this for me tonight?

43:32.314 --> 43:35.554
- Thank you.

43:47.415 --> 43:50.934
- Good night.
- Good night.

43:57.801 --> 44:02.121
Kalen will tire you if you let him.
He's always been questioning.

44:02.390 --> 44:05.749
Our parents were firm,
But it is his way.

44:11.734 --> 44:16.414
- Where are your parents?
- They've gone from this place.

44:16.698 --> 44:19.898
Oh, I'm sorry.

44:41.392 --> 44:45.872
You were right,
Philby. I did go too far.

44:48.318 --> 44:50.717
Sit with me.

44:56.327 --> 45:00.246
Mara, why do you
pull the boats up at night?

45:00.498 --> 45:02.418
Afraid they'll be stolen?

45:02.541 --> 45:06.261
Stolen?
I do not know that word.

45:06.504 --> 45:09.144
Well, are you afraid that
Someone will take them?

45:09.342 --> 45:12.621
- It is just more safe this way.
- Oh.

45:12.845 --> 45:17.165
- You must do things to be safe
Where you come from?
- Of course,

45:20.645 --> 45:23.845
Or when you come from.

45:24.067 --> 45:27.106
Ah, so I'm not just
A wandering idiot.

45:36.914 --> 45:40.193
Col'mar,

45:40.418 --> 45:42.218
Maybe we could
Find some tomorrow.

45:44.714 --> 45:46.993
Flowers?

46:16.834 --> 46:19.834
Alexander, Alexander,

46:41.528 --> 46:45.528
Ah! Morlock!

47:28.917 --> 47:31.756
- Is he all right?
- He had a dream.

47:31.920 --> 47:34.799
Oh. So did I.

47:39.554 --> 47:42.034
I was moving
Through a jungle--

47:42.223 --> 47:45.063
And you saw a shape
Ahead of you.

47:45.269 --> 47:49.708
Well, a face that...
called my name.

47:49.982 --> 47:52.942
We all have that dream.

47:55.280 --> 47:58.879
- All of you?
- Yes. Now go back asleep.

47:59.076 --> 48:02.596
You're still not well,

48:02.829 --> 48:06.029
What does that mean,
"Morlock"?

48:06.251 --> 48:11.010
A child's dream.
No more.

48:11.256 --> 48:14.016
Go back asleep,

48:36.534 --> 48:40.054
We keep these stones
In many places,

48:40.289 --> 48:44.088
This is the room where my parents
Taught me for the first time.

48:53.846 --> 48:57.125
Why do you learn this language
if you don't use it?

48:57.351 --> 49:00.710
It's a tradition we hand down.

49:00.937 --> 49:04.737
It meant something once.
Must be here for a reason.

49:07.153 --> 49:10.833
"One generation passed away,
And another comes.

49:11.033 --> 49:14.152
But the earth abided forever."

49:17.540 --> 49:21.779
Why have you come here?

49:22.004 --> 49:24.403
Why have you traveled
Through time?

49:24.548 --> 49:27.428
To have a question answered.

49:27.634 --> 49:30.034
Question?

49:30.221 --> 49:32.941
Yes. Why can't I change the past?

49:33.142 --> 49:35.342
Why would you want to?

49:41.943 --> 49:44.623
You've lost someone.

49:47.408 --> 49:49.807
Someone you loved very much.

50:00.506 --> 50:04.186
- Mara, why are there
No older people here?
- What do you mean?

50:04.427 --> 50:08.387
Older people, your parents' age
Or grandparents' age.

50:08.640 --> 50:11.480
They've gone from this place.

50:11.684 --> 50:13.884
You mean, they're dead?

50:14.063 --> 50:16.862
Yes.

50:17.067 --> 50:21.346
All of them?
How is that possible?

50:21.613 --> 50:24.653
There are things
Better left not said.

50:24.866 --> 50:29.426
We don't dwell
On the past, Alexander.

50:29.705 --> 50:32.424
- We do something else.
- What?

50:32.583 --> 50:36.102
We remember them...

50:36.297 --> 50:38.697
With these,

50:54.818 --> 50:58.457
Alexander!

51:06.288 --> 51:08.848
Alexander.

51:12.796 --> 51:15.475
- Are you coming to work now?
Come with me--
- No.

51:15.632 --> 51:18.512
Alexander's not well enough.
We're going to see his machine.

51:18.678 --> 51:24.837
- Now?
- Stay with Toren.

51:25.143 --> 51:29.862
- Go the next day, tomorrow.
- I need to see that it's all right.

51:30.150 --> 51:33.509
- This way.

51:35.196 --> 51:37.996
Will you tell me more about
N-New York tonight?

51:38.200 --> 51:40.400
I will.

52:25.087 --> 52:29.366
Oh, good.
It seems fine.

52:29.633 --> 52:32.513
We had quite a ride together.

52:33.721 --> 52:37.400
- It's ready?
- Appears so.

52:37.602 --> 52:41.121
Will you use it now?
Go back to your own time?

52:43.065 --> 52:46.424
Well, I-- I guess I could.

52:49.072 --> 52:50.912
Uh...

52:52.743 --> 52:54.584
It seems so long ago.

52:54.745 --> 52:56.785
No. You should go.

52:56.957 --> 53:01.797
And I need to ask,
Will you take Kalen with you?

53:02.087 --> 53:06.686
- Why?
- Alexander, take him away,
Back to your time. Will you?

53:06.926 --> 53:10.286
- Mara, why?
- Please. You don't know.

53:10.514 --> 53:13.594
- Take him away from here.

53:13.768 --> 53:16.608
Kalen!

53:25.364 --> 53:27.124
Mara, what's going on?

53:27.283 --> 53:29.723
They're early!
We must get Kalen!

54:15.796 --> 54:17.875
Kalen!

54:19.884 --> 54:22.644
Kalen! Kalen!

56:26.987 --> 56:29.308
Mara!

56:41.045 --> 56:43.004
- Kalen!
- No, stay here.

56:43.171 --> 56:45.531
Stay in the group!

56:58.314 --> 57:00.314
Run!

59:07.545 --> 59:09.745
Mara!

59:20.977 --> 59:23.217
Mara!

59:37.370 --> 59:42.291
Where did they take them?

59:42.543 --> 59:46.143
- We have to follow them.
We have to find them.
- We do not. Col'quin tor,

59:46.381 --> 59:50.580
- Why not?
- This is nem Eloi'tas, our life here.

59:53.890 --> 59:57.969
- How can you just do nothing?
- How can tor'tasal'mor,

59:58.227 --> 01:00:00.466
- It is the day and the night.
- The day and the night.

01:00:00.647 --> 01:00:04.247
- This is the world.

01:00:04.485 --> 01:00:08.605
- Why don't you fight back?

01:00:08.864 --> 01:00:12.264
Fight back. Why not?

01:00:12.494 --> 01:00:17.894
Those who farquil'pax...
Fight--

01:00:18.208 --> 01:00:20.808
Are taken first.

01:00:26.426 --> 01:00:28.666
- Kalen, do you know
Where they're taken?
- No.

01:00:28.846 --> 01:00:30.726
- Do they ever come back?
- No.

01:00:30.848 --> 01:00:32.967
- Has anyone ever followed them?
- I don't know.

01:00:33.101 --> 01:00:35.381
- Well, what about the Morlocks?
There must be a leader.
- We're not supposed to talk.

01:00:35.561 --> 01:00:37.641
Kalen, listen to me.
Listen.

01:00:37.815 --> 01:00:40.694
Sometimes we need to
Accept what's happening to us
Even if we don't want to.

01:00:40.901 --> 01:00:45.300
And other times we have to fight,
Even if we're afraid.

01:00:45.574 --> 01:00:49.293
Now, it's difficult
To understand, I know.

01:00:49.536 --> 01:00:53.016
Believe me, I know.
Now, they're afraid,

01:00:53.248 --> 01:00:56.368
And I'm asking you not to be.

01:00:56.585 --> 01:00:59.345
So will you tell me what you know?

01:00:59.546 --> 01:01:03.146
We can save her.
Please.

01:01:04.887 --> 01:01:09.766
When they go,
We're not supposed to talk about it.

01:01:12.811 --> 01:01:16.531
- But we all know the place.
- What place?

01:01:16.775 --> 01:01:21.295
Where the ghosts are.

01:01:43.179 --> 01:01:46.019
Here it is.

01:02:21.682 --> 01:02:26.082
Welcome to VOX system,
How may I help you?

01:02:26.354 --> 01:02:30.394
- It's all right.
- How may I serve you?

01:02:30.608 --> 01:02:33.848
What can I get you?
Oh, let's see.

01:02:34.071 --> 01:02:36.871
Um, Henry James.
Oh, no. Yes?

01:02:37.075 --> 01:02:42.034
No, no, no, Too depressing, Hemingway,
Perhaps? No, Too sweaty,

01:02:42.331 --> 01:02:45.451
Plato, Proust, Pinter,
Poe, Pound?

01:02:45.667 --> 01:02:48.427
No. Complete Works
of Martha Stewart?

01:02:48.588 --> 01:02:53.827
Ah, I have it!
Jules Verne.

01:02:54.136 --> 01:02:57.176
- Right up your alley, I would think,
- Photonic, right?

01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:00.949
Or what's left of one,
What's left of all of them?

01:03:01.143 --> 01:03:06.063
I am the last, and "these fragments
I have shored against my ruins."

01:03:06.358 --> 01:03:08.239
T.S. Eliot.

01:03:08.401 --> 01:03:12.760
You wouldn't know him yet,
But he is so depressing, yet so divine.

01:03:15.868 --> 01:03:19.748
Oh, I'm sorry. The lending library
is temporarily out of service.

01:03:19.999 --> 01:03:24.758
Not to worry. I have them all right
here-- every page of every volume.

01:03:25.046 --> 01:03:27.966
Can you tell me
What's happening here?

01:03:28.132 --> 01:03:31.172
Well, my sources are
No longer fully annotated,

01:03:31.387 --> 01:03:35.666
And my information is somewhat
Anecdotal, but I believe
What was once one race...

01:03:35.892 --> 01:03:38.013
is now two.

01:03:38.186 --> 01:03:41.545
One above
And one below.

01:03:41.774 --> 01:03:44.813
Two distinct species
That have evolved.

01:03:44.986 --> 01:03:48.946
- And how do those below survive?
- That is the real question, isn't it?

01:03:55.872 --> 01:03:59.912
- I don't believe it.
- Well,

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:04.168
If you don't like the answers,
You should avoid asking the questions.

01:04:07.595 --> 01:04:11.075
Look at them.
They have no knowledge of the past,

01:04:11.306 --> 01:04:14.826
No ambition for the future,

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:19.179
- So lucky.
- Why would you say something like that?

01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:26.828
Can you even imagine what it's like
to remember everything?

01:04:27.117 --> 01:04:31.316
I remember a six-year-old girl
Who asked me about dinosaurs
800,000 years ago.

01:04:31.581 --> 01:04:36.700
I remember the last book
I recommended: Look Homeward,
Angel, by Thomas Wolfe.

01:04:37.003 --> 01:04:41.202
And yes,
I even remember you,

01:04:46.723 --> 01:04:50.402
Time travel:
Practical application.

01:04:50.643 --> 01:04:54.682
How do you know about the Morlocks
if you can't leave this place?

01:04:54.939 --> 01:04:59.458
There was one Eloi who managed
to escape, He told me everything,

01:05:03.991 --> 01:05:08.510
We spent years together,
Just talking.

01:05:10.208 --> 01:05:14.567
The conversation's a little spotty now,
But I do remember.

01:05:14.837 --> 01:05:19.677
-It's good to have a friend.
-Then you can help us find the Morlocks,

01:05:19.927 --> 01:05:21.847
Find Mara.

01:05:24.557 --> 01:05:28.717
And if the truth is so horrible,
And will haunt your dreams for all time?

01:05:30.523 --> 01:05:34.162
Well, I think I'm used to that.

01:05:38.948 --> 01:05:44.028
My friend said he came from the east,
From the jungle.

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:49.299
- will you describe it?
- I don't have to.

01:05:51.672 --> 01:05:55.231
Just follow the breathing.

01:06:28.045 --> 01:06:33.325
In the dream, we're moving toward it,
But I think it was meant to keep us away,

01:06:39.142 --> 01:06:42.021
- I might just go in by myself.
- No.

01:06:42.188 --> 01:06:46.947
Mara would be very cross with me
if you got hurt. Now, I'll find her,

01:06:47.193 --> 01:06:51.152
But I need you to go back
To the village and light a fire
So we can find our way home.

01:06:51.406 --> 01:06:54.245
- All right? Will you do that for me?
- I lost your pocket watch.

01:06:54.451 --> 01:06:58.490
They took it from my room.

01:06:58.748 --> 01:07:01.068
I'm sorry.

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:08.388
Why would they take it?

01:08:01.903 --> 01:08:04.703
Oh. Stupid.

01:09:10.689 --> 01:09:12.529
[ Grunting ]

01:10:11.425 --> 01:10:13.505
Mara?

01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:40.010
Mara?

01:11:40.192 --> 01:11:42.152
Mara.

01:11:44.239 --> 01:11:46.079
Mara?

01:11:53.166 --> 01:11:57.685
Come a little closer.
I don't bite.

01:12:13.105 --> 01:12:15.944
Do I surprise you?

01:12:16.108 --> 01:12:19.388
- A little. Yes.
- Hmm.

01:12:19.613 --> 01:12:25.212
We weren't always like this.
After the moon fell from the sky,

01:12:25.536 --> 01:12:29.456
The Earth could no longer
Sustain the species.

01:12:29.707 --> 01:12:32.547
Some managed to stay above,

01:12:32.753 --> 01:12:36.112
The rest of us
Escaped underground,

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:41.539
Then centuries later,
When we tried to reemerge
Into the sun again, we couldn't,

01:12:41.847 --> 01:12:47.366
So we bred ourselves
Into castes.

01:12:47.644 --> 01:12:51.084
Some to be our eyes and ears.

01:12:51.273 --> 01:12:55.433
- Some to be our muscles and sinews.
- You mean you're hunters.

01:12:57.656 --> 01:13:03.174
Yes. Bred to be predators,
But bred also to be controlled.

01:13:03.454 --> 01:13:07.374
You see,
My caste concentrated...

01:13:07.625 --> 01:13:10.785
On expanding
Our cerebral abilities.

01:13:10.963 --> 01:13:16.082
- You control their thoughts.
- Not just theirs.

01:13:18.054 --> 01:13:21.173
The Eloi.

01:13:21.349 --> 01:13:25.548
So it's not enough that you hunt
Them down like animals.

01:13:25.813 --> 01:13:29.612
- That's their role here.
- To be your food?

01:13:31.736 --> 01:13:33.777
Yes.

01:13:33.947 --> 01:13:38.146
And for those who are suitable,
To be breeding vessels...

01:13:38.369 --> 01:13:41.409
For our other colonies.

01:13:41.622 --> 01:13:45.742
You see,
I'm just one of many,

01:13:46.002 --> 01:13:50.122
I don't understand how you can sit there
And speak so coldly about this.

01:13:53.678 --> 01:13:57.597
Have you not considered the human
Cost of-- of what it is you're doing?

01:13:57.849 --> 01:14:00.849
We all pay a price...

01:14:02.813 --> 01:14:04.653
Alexander.

01:14:15.243 --> 01:14:18.283
Don't worry.
You're safe.

01:14:19.791 --> 01:14:22.710
I control them.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:26.199
Without that control,

01:14:26.381 --> 01:14:29.940
They would
Exhaust the food supply...

01:14:30.178 --> 01:14:32.937
in a matter of months.

01:14:33.098 --> 01:14:36.937
Food supply?
They're human beings!

01:14:37.187 --> 01:14:39.267
Who are you...

01:14:39.396 --> 01:14:43.156
To question 800,000 years...

01:14:47.155 --> 01:14:48.915
Of evolution?

01:14:49.074 --> 01:14:52.794
-This is-- This is a perversion
Of every natural law.

01:14:53.037 --> 01:14:58.677
And what is time travel
But your pathetic attempt to
Control the world around you,

01:14:59.002 --> 01:15:03.921
-your futile effort to have
A question answered?

01:15:04.217 --> 01:15:07.576
Do you think I don't know you,
Alexander?

01:15:09.306 --> 01:15:13.425
I can look
Inside your memories,

01:15:13.645 --> 01:15:17.724
Your nightmares,
Your dreams.

01:15:17.941 --> 01:15:23.140
You're a man haunted by
Those two most terrible words:

01:15:23.446 --> 01:15:27.246
What if?

01:16:14.463 --> 01:16:17.302
Look at you!

01:16:17.507 --> 01:16:20.507
- And along ponytail--
- Daddy!

01:16:20.679 --> 01:16:25.039
- Who's that? Is it Daddy?
- Daddy!
- Long ponytail,

01:16:25.309 --> 01:16:29.589
And we're still having lots of fun,

01:16:29.856 --> 01:16:33.216
- Right, Right.

01:16:46.375 --> 01:16:49.334
Da-da! Daddy.

01:16:50.755 --> 01:16:54.915
You built your time machine
Because of Emma's death.

01:16:55.176 --> 01:16:58.575
If she had lived,
It would never have existed.

01:16:58.764 --> 01:17:02.404
So how could you use your machine
To go back to save her?

01:17:02.642 --> 01:17:07.082
You are
The inescapable result...

01:17:07.357 --> 01:17:10.036
Of your tragedy,

01:17:10.235 --> 01:17:12.634
Just as I...

01:17:12.821 --> 01:17:17.940
Am the inescapable result...
Of you.

01:17:57.371 --> 01:18:01.451
You have your answer.
Now go.

01:18:35.415 --> 01:18:39.295
I believe you have something
That belongs to me.

01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:49.869
- We all have our time machines,
Don't we?

01:18:52.477 --> 01:18:55.557
Those that take us back
Are memories...

01:18:56.731 --> 01:18:59.971
And those that
Carry us forward...

01:19:02.822 --> 01:19:05.141
Are dreams.

01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:13.850
- You're forgetting one thing.
- Huh?

01:19:18.714 --> 01:19:21.754
- What if?

01:22:49.079 --> 01:22:53.398
- What are you doing with it?
- Changing the future.

01:22:56.211 --> 01:22:58.332
Come on.

01:23:37.843 --> 01:23:40.923
Wait. Wait here.

01:25:12.617 --> 01:25:14.496
Go.

01:25:28.093 --> 01:25:30.213
- Hurry!

01:25:36.727 --> 01:25:39.047
Huh?

01:25:51.619 --> 01:25:53.699
Alexander!

01:26:40.717 --> 01:26:44.436
I'm sorry
You lost your machine.

01:26:46.308 --> 01:26:51.306
Oh, it's all right.
It was only a machine.

01:27:13.589 --> 01:27:16.748
"The congregation rose and stared...

01:27:16.967 --> 01:27:20.926
"While the three dead boys
Came marching up the aisle:

01:27:21.138 --> 01:27:24.138
"Tom in their lead,
Joe next,

01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:28.190
"And Huck,
A ruin of drooping rags,

01:27:28.438 --> 01:27:31.638
- "sneaking sheepishly in the rear.

01:27:31.817 --> 01:27:36.936
"They had hid in an unused gallery,
Listening to their own funeral sermon.

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:40.440
Aunt Poly, Mary and the Harpers
Threw themselves upon them--"

01:27:40.661 --> 01:27:43.620
This is the place.

01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:46.390
So it is.

01:27:51.923 --> 01:27:55.883
- But there's nothing here.
- Well, it was different then.

01:27:56.136 --> 01:27:59.136
My laboratory
was all around here.

01:27:59.306 --> 01:28:03.105
The kitchen was up there
Where that tree is.

01:28:05.146 --> 01:28:08.386
Not that Mrs. Watchit
Ever let me go in there.

01:28:12.196 --> 01:28:16.036
I don't know
What to tell you, sir.

01:28:16.285 --> 01:28:19.084
He's been gone
This whole week.

01:28:19.289 --> 01:28:22.248
And you've no idea
Where he went?

01:28:22.457 --> 01:28:25.298
- No, sir.
- This would be my green house,

01:28:25.503 --> 01:28:28.823
There was a garden outside.

01:28:29.007 --> 01:28:32.007
Gren 'tormar'tas?

01:28:32.177 --> 01:28:34.218
Yes.

01:28:34.388 --> 01:28:37.868
- I'm glad.
- Sir?

01:28:38.058 --> 01:28:40.619
I'm glad he's gone.

01:28:40.812 --> 01:28:44.771
Maybe he's finally found someplace
Where he can be happy.

01:28:46.153 --> 01:28:49.912
- This was my home.
- His home.

01:28:50.156 --> 01:28:52.476
Long ago.

01:28:55.037 --> 01:28:59.035
You know, Molly and I were talking
About engaging a housekeeper,

01:28:59.292 --> 01:29:02.291
Someone to live with us
And help take care of Jamie.

01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:05.263
Would you be interested?

01:29:07.635 --> 01:29:11.954
- Perhaps just until the master returns.
- Of course.

01:29:12.222 --> 01:29:16.062
- But there'd be some changes made.
I run a tight house.

01:29:16.311 --> 01:29:21.070
Oh, I have no doubt of that. I'll call
By in the morning, and we'll arrange it.

01:29:21.359 --> 01:29:25.158
- Good night, Mrs. Watchit.
- Good night, Mr. Philby.

01:29:40.297 --> 01:29:45.016
- Godspeed, my fine lad.

01:29:45.302 --> 01:29:47.181
Godspeed.
