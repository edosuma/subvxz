12:34.587 --> 12:35.850

12:37.090 --> 12:38.114
HE'S ALL RIGHT,
MRS. BAYLES.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.453
I JUST PUT HIM
DOWN FOR HIS NAP,

12:39.592 --> 12:40.525
AND HE'S
ALL RIGHT.

12:40.660 --> 12:41.923
<i>BUT I'M NOT.</i>

12:42.061 --> 12:43.324
I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
SHAKING FOR 2O MINUTES

12:43.463 --> 12:44.658
THINKING ABOUT WHAT
MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.424
VVHAT MIGHT HA\/E HAPPENED, MR.
PETERSON?

12:46.566 --> 12:49.001
<i>YOUR SON ALMOST
GOT HIMSELF KILLED.</i>

12:49.135 --> 12:51.467
RAN RIGHT OUT IN FRONT
OF MY OAR FROM NOVVHERE.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.902
<i>LUCKY THING I'M A CAUTIOUS DRIVER, MR.
BAYLES.</i>

12:54.040 --> 12:55.098
OH, EXCUSE ME.

12:55.241 --> 12:56.640
BILLY DOESN'T PLAY
IN THE STREETS.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.369

ANYTHING VVHEN HE VVENT OUT.

12:59.979 --> 13:01.208
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:01.347 --> 13:02.473
<i>WELL, HE PLAYED
IN THE STREETS TODAY.</i>

13:02.615 --> 13:03.980
HE RAN RIGHT OUT
IN FRONT OF MY CAR--

13:04.117 --> 13:05.881
DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TIME
TO PUT THE BRAKES ON.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.283
I COULDN'T HAVE MISSED HIM
BY MORE THAN A FEW INCHES.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.788
IT WASN'T MY FAULT,
MR. BAYLES, HONEST.

13:10.923 --> 13:13.187
APPARENTLY IT WASN'T
ANYBODY'S FAULT.

13:42.922 --> 13:45.653
MR. BAYLES...

13:45.792 --> 13:47.851
I THINK YOU'D BETTER HA\/E
A TALK VVITH YOUR BOY.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.053

WHAT ABOUT?

13:50.196 --> 13:53.131
WELL... WHEN I SAW
THAT HE WAS ALL RIGHT,

13:53.266 --> 13:56.099
I ASKED HIM WHY HE DID
A CRAZY THING LIKE THAT,

13:56.235 --> 13:58.829
RUNNING OUT IN THE
MIDDLE OF A BUSY STREET.

13:58.971 --> 14:01.838
HE SAID SOMEBODY
TOLD HIM TO.

14:01.974 --> 14:06.002
SOMEBODY TOLD
HIM TO?

14:06.145 --> 14:06.873
WHO?

14:07.013 --> 14:08.503

14:08.648 --> 14:10.878
MR. BAYLES, YOU KNOW
I'D NEVER TELL BILLY

14:11.017 --> 14:12.485
TO DO A THING
LIKE THAT.

14:12.618 --> 14:14.382
WHO ELSE DID HE
TALK TO, SHIRLEY?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.682
NO ONE, HE DIDN'T
TALK TO NO ONE.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.951
HE JUST SAT UP IN HIS
ROOM ALL DAY LONG

14:19.092 --> 14:21.584
JUST TALKING ON
THAT TOY TELEPHONE.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.093
