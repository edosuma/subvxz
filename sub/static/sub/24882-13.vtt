Oh, there's a great one in here
about dinosaurs,

00:25.266 --> 00:28.066
and, oh, that's my favorite one
about painting pictures,

00:28.066 --> 00:30.300
and, oh, this one
is all about fishing,

00:30.300 --> 00:34.166
and the one of the top--
let's see-- I can't
quite see it.

00:34.166 --> 00:36.867
Oh, whoa, whoa!

Um...

01:19.033 --> 01:20.967
Huh.

01:20.967 --> 01:23.633
- Um...

01:23.633 --> 01:26.433
Oh, ho ho!
Hi, guys. Huh?

01:26.433 --> 01:29.767
Oh, hi there.
Welcome to Sesame Street.

01:29.767 --> 01:32.834
- Hey, Elmo.
How you doing today?
- Hi, Alan.

01:32.834 --> 01:35.000
Oh, Elmo's very excited
and happy.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.333
Oh, well, you don't seem
excited or happy.

01:38.333 --> 01:40.100
Oh, sorry, Alan.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.967
Elmo's just thinking
very hard.

01:42.967 --> 01:46.233
You know, Elmo's friend Zuzu
is coming to visit him.

01:46.233 --> 01:48.567
She's coming
from very far away.

01:48.567 --> 01:50.266
- Oh, that's great.
- Uh-huh.

01:50.266 --> 01:52.433
So, far away like
from another street,

01:52.433 --> 01:54.166
far away like
from another town?

01:54.166 --> 01:56.433
South Africa.

01:56.433 --> 01:59.400
- Wait.
The country South Africa?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.767
That is very,
very far away.

02:01.767 --> 02:03.633
Yeah, Elmo thought so.

02:03.633 --> 02:06.600
Boy, Elmo was thinking
about how he would feel

02:06.600 --> 02:09.200
if Elmo was far away
from home.

02:09.200 --> 02:12.300
Boy, Elmo might miss it
a little bit.

02:12.300 --> 02:15.200
Oh, so you're thinking about
how you could make Zuzu

02:15.200 --> 02:18.467
feel more at home
when she gets to Sesame Street.

02:18.467 --> 02:20.633
Right, but, you know,
Elmo doesn't know anything

02:20.633 --> 02:22.166
about Zuzu's home.

02:22.166 --> 02:24.900
Well, you know, Elmo,
there is a place

02:24.900 --> 02:27.700
that can help you learn more
about South Africa.

02:27.700 --> 02:29.734
It's not
South Africa, is it?

02:29.734 --> 02:31.967
- No.
- Because South Africa is...

02:31.967 --> 02:34.567
- Both: Very, very far away.

02:34.567 --> 02:37.967
No. This place is not far,
and I'm going there now.

02:37.967 --> 02:39.600
- Yeah, sure, okay.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.934
- All right, let's go.
- Okay. Ha ha ha!

02:44.233 --> 02:47.333
- Hello. I brought
another box of books.
- Ha ha ha!

02:47.333 --> 02:49.967
- Elmo, I never
throw away books.
- Oh.

02:49.967 --> 02:52.333
When I finish reading them,
I bring them here

02:52.333 --> 02:54.834
because there's always
somebody else who'd enjoy
reading them.

02:54.834 --> 02:57.967
Oh, boy,
that's very kind
of you, Alan.

02:57.967 --> 02:59.200
Oh...

02:59.200 --> 03:01.233
Good morning, Alan.

03:01.233 --> 03:02.934
- Hello, Frankie.
- Hey, Frankie!

03:02.934 --> 03:07.133
Oh, hi, Elmo.
Welcome to Frankie's Book Nook.

03:07.133 --> 03:10.667
- Elmo is here to learn
about South Africa.
- That's right.

03:10.667 --> 03:13.633
Elmo wants
to get some ideas
for things to do

03:13.633 --> 03:16.700
with his friend Zuzu
so she won't miss home.

03:16.700 --> 03:19.667
Well, this place
is loaded with ideas.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.233
Oh, oh, oh,
where are the ideas?

03:21.233 --> 03:22.767
Where?
Are they under the table?

03:22.767 --> 03:26.300
Oh, Elmo,
you're surrounded by them.

03:26.300 --> 03:29.200
Books are filled
with great ideas.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.600
Oh, that's so cool.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.600
Elmo thought that books were
only full of made-up stories.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.667
Oh.

03:36.667 --> 03:39.100
Well, some books
are storybooks,

03:39.100 --> 03:41.066
- but there are also
picture books...
- Elmo: Uh-huh.

03:41.066 --> 03:43.934
Books about real people,
and information books.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.900
It's time for me to go
open up Hooper's Store,

03:47.900 --> 03:50.467
so, Elmo, Frankie
will help you out.

03:50.467 --> 03:53.433
She loves books.
She's a real bookworm.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.467
Alan,
you're such a card.

03:55.467 --> 03:57.266
- All right.
See you guys later.
- Elmo: Bye-bye, Alan.

03:57.266 --> 03:58.400
- Frankie: See you later.
- Bye.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.166
All right, Elmo.

04:00.166 --> 04:03.400
I know I have a book about
South Africa here somewhere.

04:03.400 --> 04:07.100
- Elmo, Zuzu's coming
today, right?
- Yeah.

04:07.100 --> 04:10.900
- It sure is, Abby.

04:10.900 --> 04:13.233
Elmo and Frankie
are looking for a book

04:13.233 --> 04:14.867
about South Africa
for her.

04:14.867 --> 04:17.033
Ooh! Well, what time
is she coming?

04:17.033 --> 04:19.166
- Lunchtime.

04:19.166 --> 04:21.467
That's soon!
Let's get wiggling.

04:21.467 --> 04:23.100
I'll help.
Can I help?

04:23.100 --> 04:25.333
You've got the job.
Now let's hurry.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.800
Oh, ho ho! Yeah.

04:27.800 --> 04:33.066
Oh, here's a book of cars
and one about maze puzzles.

04:33.066 --> 04:36.867
Mmph! No!
Keep looking.

04:36.867 --> 04:39.734
Oh, wow.
Heavy. Ha ha!

04:39.734 --> 04:42.066
Here's one with
a big, white whale on it.

04:42.066 --> 04:44.333
Ha! Looks like
no one's ever read it.

04:44.333 --> 04:47.000
Ugh, keep looking.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.767
Oh, ho ho!

04:48.767 --> 04:51.533
Whoa. Ha ha ha!
Oh. Ha ha!

04:51.533 --> 04:55.834
- Ah, this book has all kinds
of interesting food on it.
- Yeah.

04:55.834 --> 04:59.400
That's a cookbook of recipes
from around the world.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.066
- Keep looking.
- Oh, well, wait a minute,
Frankie.

05:01.066 --> 05:04.433
Does that book have recipes
from South Africa?

05:04.433 --> 05:06.967
Maybe we can make Zuzu

05:06.967 --> 05:09.166
the kind of food
she eats at home.

05:09.166 --> 05:10.967
That's a great idea,
Elmo.

05:10.967 --> 05:12.734
Ha ha!
Thank you, Abby.

05:12.734 --> 05:15.100
Now let's see.
Zuzu's favorite food is, um...

05:15.100 --> 05:18.200
Oh, oh, oh,
pap and tomato gravy.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.100
Well, let's see.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.533
Ha ha ha!

05:22.533 --> 05:23.900
Bingo!
It's here.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.533
Elmo:
Oh, ho ho! Cool.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.767
Hey, maybe Alan
can make it for her.

05:27.767 --> 05:29.266
Oh, boy.

05:29.266 --> 05:31.600
Well, I'll take
the cookbook to him...

05:31.600 --> 05:32.867
♪ Hmm hmm. ♪

05:32.867 --> 05:35.300
...and you keep looking
for more ideas.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.600
Okay, Abby.
Ha ha ha!

05:37.600 --> 05:39.200
Now let's see here.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.433
- Alan! Alan! Alan!

05:42.433 --> 05:44.133
- Alan.

05:44.133 --> 05:45.767
Ahh...

05:45.767 --> 05:50.200
Can you make
this recipe here
for our friend Zuzu?

05:50.200 --> 05:52.800
Let's see.
It says, "paap."

05:52.800 --> 05:54.266
- Abby: "Pahp."

05:54.266 --> 05:55.934
- Abby: "Pahp."
- And tomato gravy.

05:55.934 --> 05:57.867
Yeah.
It's a South African food.

05:57.867 --> 06:00.166
All right. You know,
I've never made it before,

06:00.166 --> 06:03.667
but we have
all the ingredients,

06:03.667 --> 06:05.066
- so, yes, I can make it.
- Oh...

06:05.066 --> 06:06.500
We just have to follow
the recipe.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.433
Ha ha!
Cookbooks are so magical.

06:09.433 --> 06:11.333
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm...

06:11.333 --> 06:13.500
Oh, I just know
there's a book

06:13.500 --> 06:15.867
about South Africa
here somewhere.

06:15.867 --> 06:18.667
Oh, oh, Frankie, Elmo found
pictures of clothes

06:18.667 --> 06:20.433
that look very different.

06:20.433 --> 06:24.367
Ah, that's it!
Elmo, you found the book.

06:24.367 --> 06:25.400
Oh, ho ho!

06:25.400 --> 06:27.467
Hmm, let's see.

06:27.467 --> 06:30.600
Dashiki-- worn
in parts of Africa,

06:30.600 --> 06:32.500
including South Africa.

06:32.500 --> 06:36.133
Ah, so some people
in South Africa wear dashikis.

06:36.133 --> 06:39.066
Oh, oh, and look--
musicians.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.100
Oh, that gives Elmo
an idea.

06:41.100 --> 06:44.767
What if Elmo, Abby,
and Frankie throw a party

06:44.767 --> 06:48.266
to make Zuzu feel at home
when she gets to Sesame Street?

06:48.266 --> 06:52.333
Yes, with South African food
and South African music.

06:52.333 --> 06:56.200
Hey, there's
some musical penguins
that play down the street.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.300
Boy, Elmo wonders
if the penguins

06:58.300 --> 06:59.934
could play
South African music.

06:59.934 --> 07:01.900
Oh, they might.
Look.

07:01.900 --> 07:05.166
It says here,
black-footed penguins
live in South Africa.

07:05.166 --> 07:07.333
Elmo will ask them
about their feet.
Be right back.

07:14.800 --> 07:18.467
Ha ha ha! Oh.
Oh, musical penguins, hello?

07:20.133 --> 07:21.467
Oh, hi, guys.

07:21.467 --> 07:24.500
Elmo has
three questions for you.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.834
One-- do you play
different kinds of music?

07:27.834 --> 07:32.967
Sure-- jazz, R&B,
country, whatever.

07:32.967 --> 07:34.600
Oh, cool!

07:34.600 --> 07:37.800
Oh, question number two--
do the musical penguins

07:37.800 --> 07:39.867
know South African music?

07:41.633 --> 07:43.300
- That's where we're from.
- Mm-hmm.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.767
We're black-footed
penguins.

07:45.767 --> 07:47.266
Oh, great!

07:47.266 --> 07:49.367
That was Elmo's
next question.

07:49.367 --> 07:50.600
Oh, come on, guys.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.433
Elmo has a job for you.
This way.

07:54.133 --> 07:56.266
You got it!

07:56.266 --> 07:58.567
Oh, oh.

08:00.734 --> 08:02.333
- Alan:
Careful, Abby. It's hot.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

08:02.333 --> 08:03.934
Look. Ta-da!

08:03.934 --> 08:05.934
Pap and tomato gravy.

08:05.934 --> 08:09.133
Ah, pap and tomato gravy
smells so yummy.

08:09.133 --> 08:10.834
It does.
All right, you know what?

08:10.834 --> 08:15.300
We better get over
to the community center
before Zuzu gets here, okay?

08:15.300 --> 08:17.867
- Yeah, yeah. Let's go.
- All right, let's go,
let's go.

08:19.367 --> 08:22.700
Oh, ho ho!
Yeah, baby!

08:22.700 --> 08:25.100
Ha ha ha!
Huh?

08:25.100 --> 08:29.433
- Oh, Alan, hi.
- This music is great, Elmo,
and you are looking good.

08:29.433 --> 08:33.300
Thank you, Alan.
Elmo's wearing a dashiki.

08:33.300 --> 08:35.867
Some people in South Africa
wear them.

08:35.867 --> 08:37.200
Alan:
Yeah.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.734
Oh! It's Zuzu!
Hi, Zuzu!

08:40.734 --> 08:42.100
Elmo!

08:42.100 --> 08:46.166
Zuzu, hi!
Welcome to Sesame Street.

08:46.166 --> 08:48.066
Thank you.
Ngiyabonga.

08:48.066 --> 08:50.734
Zuzu, Elmo wants you
to meet Elmo's friends

08:50.734 --> 08:53.433
Frankie, Alan,
and Abby.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.033
Hello.

08:55.033 --> 08:57.133
- Oh, Elmo...

08:57.133 --> 08:59.166
- I was just thinking
I'm missing home, na.

08:59.166 --> 09:02.000
And then I saw
all of this.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.066
- And I heard the music.
- Uh-huh.

09:04.066 --> 09:05.734
Oh, Elmo...

09:05.734 --> 09:07.900
I smell that food.

09:07.900 --> 09:11.200
I didn't know you made
pap and tomato gravy here.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.967
It is my favorite!

09:12.967 --> 09:16.433
Ah, well,
Elmo got the idea
from this cookbook.

09:16.433 --> 09:17.934
- Zuzu: Oh, wow.
- Yeah, that's right.

09:17.934 --> 09:19.533
- And you know, Zuzu...

09:19.533 --> 09:21.800
Elmo got the idea
for the clothes,

09:21.800 --> 09:24.500
oh, and for the music
in another book.

09:24.500 --> 09:28.300
- Oh, wow!
- And Elmo got
musical penguins.

09:28.300 --> 09:29.500
Mm mm.
Mm mm mm.

09:32.567 --> 09:35.567
Wait. How do penguins
know South African music?

09:35.567 --> 09:38.600
Well, Alan,
black-footed penguins

09:38.600 --> 09:40.600
live in South Africa.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.667
Yebo.

09:41.667 --> 09:43.033
Elmo found that
in a book, too.

09:43.033 --> 09:45.700
- Yeah, but, Elmo...

09:45.700 --> 09:49.200
How could you know
this would make me
feel so happy?

09:49.200 --> 09:52.000
Well, you know, Zuzu,
Elmo thought

09:52.000 --> 09:55.333
about how he would feel
if he was far away from home.

09:55.333 --> 09:58.600
- Mm-hmm.
- Boy, Elmo thought that he
might miss home a little bit.

09:58.600 --> 10:01.600
Ah, you are right, Elmo.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.834
- I was missing home
a little.

10:03.834 --> 10:06.367
- But this--
this is perfect.
- Oh, ho ho!

10:06.367 --> 10:09.800
You know, I wanted ideas
for things to see and do here,
