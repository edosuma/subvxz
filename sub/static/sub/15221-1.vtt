you kicked 'em out of the tank...

11:01.861 --> 11:04.659

been struck by lightning...

Ah.

11:09.902 --> 11:12.097
I remember a big bolt
just as we leaped.

11:12.171 --> 11:15.504
Okay, well, see, the lightning strike
could have been misread by Ziggy...

11:15.574 --> 11:20.011
as a catastrophic collapse
of the radium accelerator ring
surrounding the imaging chamber.

11:20.079 --> 11:22.206
Ziggy would've automatically
sealed the chamber...

11:22.281 --> 11:24.340
to protect the project
from radium radiation.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.750
But when they realize
that the ring didn't collapse,
then they're gonna open the door!

11:27.820 --> 11:31.813
Well, see, once the door has been sealed,
it can't be reopened by Ziggy...

11:31.891 --> 11:36.191

of the radium ring has expired.

38:51.762 --> 38:53.696
Part of me is Al.

38:56.300 --> 39:01.169
- One minute and counting.
- How will you get back?

39:01.238 --> 39:04.173
Use the retrieval program.

39:04.241 --> 39:06.971
It didn't work
the first time you leaped.

39:08.612 --> 39:10.603
I've updated it.

39:10.681 --> 39:13.741
Ziggy, what are the odds
of retrieving Dr. Beckett?

39:13.818 --> 39:16.252
9.6 percent.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.948
Donna. Donna.

39:20.624 --> 39:22.558
I can't let him die.

39:22.626 --> 39:26.619
And I can't let you go.
Not when you've just come back to me.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.722
How many times has Al saved my life?

39:28.799 --> 39:30.733
<i>[ Ziggy ]</i>
<i>Twenty-three.</i>

39:30.801 --> 39:33.065
I don't care!

39:35.940 --> 39:40.536
It isn't fair, Sam.
It just isn't fair.

39:40.611 --> 39:42.545
I know.

39:44.115 --> 39:48.848
Please don't leave me again.
I don't think I could stand it
if you left me again.

39:50.121 --> 39:52.817
<i>[ Ziggy ]</i>
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>
[ Exhales ]

39:52.890 --> 39:58.658
<i>Twenty-nine, 28, 2 7</i>-

39:58.729 --> 40:00.890
Go.
What?

40:00.965 --> 40:02.899
<i>Twenty-six</i>-
Go.

40:02.967 --> 40:05.265
<i>Twenty-five</i>-
I'll be back.

40:05.336 --> 40:09.295
I swear to God I'll be back.
<i>Twenty-four, 23</i>-

40:09.373 --> 40:11.307
<i>Sam, I love you.</i>

40:11.375 --> 40:13.969
<i>Twenty-two, 2 1</i>-

40:14.044 --> 40:16.239
I love you too.

40:16.313 --> 40:19.805
<i>Twenty seconds. Nineteen</i>-

40:29.460 --> 40:33.658
Eleven. Ten seconds.

40:33.731 --> 40:36.529
<i>Nine</i>-
Synchotron on line.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.535
Affirmative.
<i>[ Gooshie ]</i>
<i>Stand by to fire.!</i>

40:39.603 --> 40:41.628
<i>[ Ziggy ]</i>
<i>Seven</i>-
<i>Fire.!</i>

40:41.705 --> 40:43.639
<i>Six</i>-
<i>Fire.!</i>

40:43.707 --> 40:48.269
<i>Five, four</i>-

[ Grunts ]

41:03.761 --> 41:05.695
<i>[ Clifford Screaming ]</i>

41:05.763 --> 41:07.287
<i>[ Thud ]</i>

41:09.600 --> 41:13.661
[ Groaning ]
Al, honey. Are you okay?

41:13.737 --> 41:16.467
<i>Am I okay?</i>
<i>I'll tell you about it later.</i>

41:16.540 --> 41:20.067
When we're in bed.
Oh, Al.
[ Giggles ]

41:20.144 --> 41:22.374
Ready to retrieve.

41:22.446 --> 41:24.380
Ready.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.477
Retrieving.

42:02.086 --> 42:05.351
Gooshie?

42:05.422 --> 42:08.084
Gooshie, come on! This is-

42:27.545 --> 42:30.173
- <i>He leaped.</i>
- When?

42:30.247 --> 42:34.547
Just after that girl Suzanne
regained consciousness.

42:34.618 --> 42:37.086
And where is he now?

42:37.154 --> 42:41.955
Oh, he's a stand-up comic
playing the Catskills in 1 956.

42:44.228 --> 42:46.355
Does he remember me?

42:46.430 --> 42:50.799
Oh, no. No. He doesn't even remember
him and me leaping together.

42:53.203 --> 42:55.899
So he doesn't
remember coming home?

42:55.973 --> 42:58.942
No. No.

43:00.444 --> 43:04.210
Why does Ziggy think Sam
leaped into this stand-up comic?

43:05.749 --> 43:09.685
Oh, um, well,
there's a little girl...

43:09.753 --> 43:12.984
that's being torn apart
by a divorce.

43:15.426 --> 43:18.987
So Sam is there to put this comic
and his wife back together?

43:19.063 --> 43:23.500
No, not exactly. He's there
to put the comic with this waitress...

43:23.567 --> 43:27.025
so that the two of them
could raise the little girl.

43:27.104 --> 43:29.197
Can he do it?

43:29.273 --> 43:31.833
Oh, sure. Yeah.
The waitress is-

43:31.909 --> 43:36.005
She's nuts about him.
I mean- Um-

43:36.080 --> 43:39.072
I know exactly what you mean.

43:40.918 --> 43:45.685
Sam couldn't do what he has to do
if he remembered us.

43:50.060 --> 43:53.552
You'll tell him nothing, Al.

43:53.631 --> 43:58.091
He came back to me once.
He'll come back again.

44:04.008 --> 44:05.942
You're an amazing woman.

44:10.781 --> 44:13.409
1 956.

44:15.352 --> 44:18.287
Ziggy?
<i>Yes, Dr. Eleese?</i>

44:20.824 --> 44:25.227
Locate a star
43 light-years from Earth.

44:25.295 --> 44:27.855
<i>Talitha in Ursa Major.</i>

44:27.931 --> 44:30.559
