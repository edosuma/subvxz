00:04.038 --> 00:05.971
NARRATOR: Previously
on "Hell's Kitchen"--

00:06.075 --> 00:08.698
Please welcome
the one and only--

00:08.801 --> 00:10.079
Mr. Potato Head.

00:10.182 --> 00:11.597
I haven't seen one of thesethings in 30 fucking years.

00:11.701 --> 00:12.978
GORDON RAMSAY: Go!

00:13.082 --> 00:14.738
NARRATOR: Chef Ramsay challengedthe chefs to create a dish

00:14.842 --> 00:16.223
with potatoes as the star--

00:16.326 --> 00:17.603
Oh yeah, that's perfect.

00:17.707 --> 00:19.950
NARRATOR: --to be judged byoutspoken chef Richard Blake.

00:20.054 --> 00:22.815
Sometimes people are beautifulin jeans and a t-shirt.

00:22.919 --> 00:25.577
I wanted more jeans and
a t-shirt in this dish.

00:25.680 --> 00:28.166
NARRATOR: Rookie Mia continuedher excellence in challenges,

00:28.269 --> 00:29.443
earning another perfect score.

00:29.546 --> 00:30.651
- Five.
- Five.

00:30.754 --> 00:31.548
Congrats.

00:31.652 --> 00:32.480
Great job.

00:32.584 --> 00:34.103
I got a ten on my dish.

00:34.206 --> 00:35.828
NARRATOR: On the red
team, Chris surprised

00:35.932 --> 00:37.485
everyone with his perfect dish.

00:37.589 --> 00:38.728
Look, I have goosebumps.

00:38.831 --> 00:39.867
That's how good this dish is.

00:39.970 --> 00:41.075
Thank you, chef.

00:41.179 --> 00:42.456
NARRATOR: And when bothteams ended the challenge

00:42.559 --> 00:43.353
in a tie, it was--

00:43.457 --> 00:44.492
Chris

00:44.596 --> 00:45.873
NARRATOR: --who had the
best dish of the day

00:45.976 --> 00:47.392
and won the challenge
for the men.

00:47.495 --> 00:48.289
Good job, Chris.

00:48.393 --> 00:49.428
Thank you.

00:49.532 --> 00:50.809
NARRATOR: But shockingly,only hours later,

00:50.912 --> 00:53.501
it became clear that theintensity of the competition

00:53.605 --> 00:55.227
was too much for Chris.

00:55.331 --> 00:56.918
I'm starting to feel,
like, certain emotions.

00:57.022 --> 00:58.161
It's bringing back a demon.

00:58.265 --> 00:59.369
Then you need to
go and get help.

00:59.473 --> 01:00.646
- Yes, sir.
- Go.

01:00.750 --> 01:01.820
Head out.

01:01.923 --> 01:03.373
NARRATOR: And he made a
very difficult decision.

01:03.477 --> 01:05.789
GORDON RAMSAY: Chris has
left the competition.

01:05.893 --> 01:07.239
NARRATOR: At dinner service--- All right.

01:07.343 --> 01:08.413
Let's do this one for Chris.

01:08.516 --> 01:09.793
NARRATOR: --although
friction arose

01:09.897 --> 01:11.036
between Trevor and Scotley--

01:11.140 --> 01:12.106
GORDON RAMSAY: Who scored these?

01:12.210 --> 01:13.142
SCOTLEY: Trevor.

01:13.245 --> 01:14.453
Same team, bro.

01:14.557 --> 01:16.352
NARRATOR: --and Motto tookhis time to find his voice--

01:16.455 --> 01:17.353
GORDON RAMSAY: We need to talk.

01:17.456 --> 01:18.664
Let's Go.

01:18.768 --> 01:20.218
I wanted to show ChefRamsay that I do have a voice.

01:20.321 --> 01:21.426
Two filet, one
chicken, one ribeye.

01:21.529 --> 01:22.599
Heard.

01:22.703 --> 01:24.084
NARRATOR: --the men had
their best service yet.

01:24.187 --> 01:26.120
GORDON RAMSAY: Trevor, you'recooking has been on point.

01:26.224 --> 01:28.950
Fuck, yeah, I
love meat station.

01:29.054 --> 01:30.090
It feels good, man.

01:30.193 --> 01:32.126
NARRATOR: In the blue
kitchen, unbelievably,

01:32.230 --> 01:34.715
season 16 runner-up
Heather and season

01:34.818 --> 01:38.201
14 runner-up T were adisaster on the meat station--

01:38.305 --> 01:41.204
GORDON RAMSAY: T, Heather, theydefinitely need more cooking.

01:41.308 --> 01:42.861
Right here.

01:42.964 --> 01:43.965
Heather and T--

01:44.069 --> 01:45.450
[inaudible] refired.

01:45.553 --> 01:46.416
GORDON RAMSAY: Heather, T--

01:46.520 --> 01:47.797
NARRATOR: --and
their meat meltdown

01:47.900 --> 01:49.902
got the entire teamkicked out of the kitchen.

01:50.006 --> 01:51.214
Get out!

01:51.318 --> 01:53.182
NARRATOR: Not surprisingly,the blue team nominated--

01:53.285 --> 01:54.493
T Chef--
NARRATOR: And--

01:54.597 --> 01:55.494
Heather.

01:55.598 --> 01:57.220
NARRATOR: Chef
Ramsay decided on--

01:57.324 --> 01:59.774
T. Take off your
jacket, young lady.

01:59.878 --> 02:02.639
NARRATOR: --ending her dreamof becoming the executive chef

02:02.743 --> 02:04.883
at Gordon Ramsay's "Hell'sKitchen" restaurant

02:04.986 --> 02:06.678
at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

02:11.579 --> 02:14.858
And now, the continuationof "Hell's Kitchen."

02:14.962 --> 02:15.997
Get out of there.

02:16.101 --> 02:16.895
Yes, chef.

02:20.692 --> 02:22.245
Can I puke now?

02:22.349 --> 02:23.419
Holy shit.

02:23.522 --> 02:25.938
I made it the entire
season 16 without having

02:26.042 --> 02:27.526
to feel the way I did tonight.

02:27.630 --> 02:30.357
And let me tell you, it'senough fuel to never,

02:30.460 --> 02:32.945
ever want to fuck up
in dinner service.

02:33.049 --> 02:35.155
Yeah, Ken, can I get a
fucking shot of Jack?

02:38.088 --> 02:40.677
SCOTLEY: Hey, Trev,
good way of holding

02:40.781 --> 02:43.301
down that meat station today.

02:43.404 --> 02:45.613
It was nice to be ableto actually work a station

02:45.717 --> 02:47.063
for you guys, you know?

02:47.167 --> 02:50.653
Show you the old man
knows what he's doing.

02:50.756 --> 02:52.758
Sometimes you started
talking so much, though,

02:52.862 --> 02:56.762
and you're like, "Yo,
shut the fuck up."

02:56.866 --> 02:58.316
Yeah, catch your
breath, too, man.

02:58.419 --> 02:59.489
I repeat, man.

02:59.593 --> 03:00.697
MOTTO: I looked at
Scotley one time.

03:00.801 --> 03:02.009
I'm like, "I'm going to
punch this mother-fucker

03:02.112 --> 03:03.079
in the mouth."

03:03.183 --> 03:04.701
He adds one more time,
this same ticket.

03:04.805 --> 03:05.599
Look.

03:05.702 --> 03:06.496
All right.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.601
Last time.

03:07.704 --> 03:12.295
[music playing]

03:12.399 --> 03:13.745
This has been my
entire life, you know.

03:13.848 --> 03:14.746
I get teased and picked on

03:14.849 --> 03:19.095
Two strips, one video.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.615
Just like I did the last timeI was here in "Hell's Kitchen."

03:21.718 --> 03:23.064
And I'm branzino.

03:23.168 --> 03:24.445
When you're getting
picked on, it's

03:24.549 --> 03:26.620
because somebody is afraid ofyou or they're intimidated.

03:26.723 --> 03:28.311
So go right ahead becausethat just means I'm

03:28.415 --> 03:29.519
playing the game the right way.

03:29.623 --> 03:31.003
[theme music]

04:07.454 --> 04:08.386
GORDON RAMSAY:

04:09.594 --> 04:11.078
Come on.

04:11.181 --> 04:11.975
Good morning, Chef.

04:12.079 --> 04:13.045
Good morning.

04:13.149 --> 04:14.323
Let's go.

04:14.426 --> 04:16.739
Line up, please.

04:16.842 --> 04:21.813
If I asked you what the keyelement is to a kitchen running

04:21.916 --> 04:23.366
smoothly, what would you say?

04:23.470 --> 04:24.505
Time management.

04:24.609 --> 04:25.713
Communication, Chef.

04:25.817 --> 04:26.611
Interesting.

04:26.714 --> 04:28.578
Consistency, Chef.

04:28.682 --> 04:33.790
All good answers, but
nobody said teamwork.

04:33.894 --> 04:36.414
If you have it, that's
when your kitchen

04:36.517 --> 04:39.451
runs like a well-oiled machine.

04:39.555 --> 04:49.979
[car revving]

04:50.082 --> 04:52.809
ROE: Seeing that stock car justwhipping around the parking lot

04:52.913 --> 04:55.847
puts a little pep in your step.

04:55.950 --> 04:59.126
My heart's racing because I'ma huge Fast and Furious fan,

04:59.229 --> 05:02.267
but the other part of me is justlike, "Dude, I just woke up.

05:02.371 --> 05:04.787
It is very, very earlyfor this to be happening."

05:04.890 --> 05:22.529
[car revving]

05:22.632 --> 05:24.531
Now that is what
I call teamwork.

05:24.634 --> 05:26.498
Never in my life
would have compared

05:26.602 --> 05:28.742
a pit crew to a kitchen--

05:28.845 --> 05:30.053
All of you, head
into kitchens.

05:30.157 --> 05:31.469
Let's go.

05:31.572 --> 05:34.334
--but it is exactly like howa kitchen is ran, actually.

05:34.437 --> 05:39.856
Minus the tires and the
nuts and the screws.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.376
Line up, please.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.791
OK.

05:43.895 --> 05:48.658
As you can see, there are fiveamazing dishes in front of you.

05:48.762 --> 05:52.352
Spaghetti meatball marinara,veal scallopini piccata,

05:52.455 --> 05:57.667
crispy fried chicken, shrimp anddelicious grits, and cioppino.

05:57.771 --> 05:58.634
Recognize those?

05:58.737 --> 05:59.807
ALL: Yes, Chef.

05:59.911 --> 06:01.533
I made all these things,in every restaurant

06:01.637 --> 06:02.500
I've ever worked in.

06:02.603 --> 06:04.916
These are staple dishes.

06:05.019 --> 06:07.815
For your next
challenge, each team

06:07.919 --> 06:12.544
will have 40 minutes to recreatethese five incredible dishes.

06:12.648 --> 06:15.064
It seems deceptively easy.

06:15.167 --> 06:18.378
As always, it's importantto be aware of what

06:18.481 --> 06:20.863
every member of your
brigade is doing,

06:20.966 --> 06:23.175
just like the pit crew outside.

06:23.279 --> 06:27.076
Staying connected is the
key to great teamwork.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.285
Blue team, you
have an extra chef.

06:29.389 --> 06:33.841
So which one of you six
sits out the challenge?

06:33.945 --> 06:35.256
I don't want to
sit out, [inaudible]..

06:35.360 --> 06:36.154
I don't want to sit out.

06:36.257 --> 06:37.258
I don't want sit out, either.

06:37.362 --> 06:38.156
I'll do it.

06:38.259 --> 06:39.537
Are you sure?

06:39.640 --> 06:40.952
Dude, right away.

06:41.055 --> 06:42.125
I'll sit out.

06:42.229 --> 06:44.093
A little odd to me, but
I'm in this challenge.

06:44.196 --> 06:44.990
I'm in it until we win.

06:45.094 --> 06:45.888
Blue team.

06:45.991 --> 06:46.889
Who sitting out?

06:46.992 --> 06:47.821
I am, Chef.

06:47.924 --> 06:49.443
You don't know those five?

06:49.547 --> 06:51.963
Yeah, I know all of the five.

06:52.066 --> 06:53.136
Well, fine.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.586
Come on.

06:54.690 --> 06:57.762
This side of the pass, and youcan support your team verbally.

06:57.865 --> 06:59.142
I know that I can cook.

06:59.246 --> 07:00.730
The thing that I need to workon, especially with my team,

07:00.834 --> 07:01.697
is communication.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.043
This is my opportunity
right here.

07:03.146 --> 07:07.806
Your 40 minutes starts now.

07:07.910 --> 07:09.152
CHEF: Let's do it now.
Come here.

07:09.256 --> 07:10.844
I want to do the spaghettiand meatballs so I can knock

07:10.947 --> 07:12.432
it out and float after I do.

07:12.535 --> 07:14.434
The fish dish is going to takeme the least amount of time,

07:14.537 --> 07:15.400
so I can--
- Right.

07:15.504 --> 07:16.505
Same thing with the
veal scallopini.

07:16.608 --> 07:18.127
I can drive with you guys.So there it is.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.162
All right.
Everybody's clear?

07:19.266 --> 07:20.440
I can make this in my sleep.

07:20.543 --> 07:21.924
Let's do it.
- Motto, you're good.

07:22.027 --> 07:23.132
Right?
- Yes, sir.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.961
Shrimp and grits, wasn'tthat his signature dish?

07:25.065 --> 07:26.031
It is.
That's what he's got it.

07:26.135 --> 07:27.826
I want to make this
shrimp and grits again.

07:27.930 --> 07:30.691
I want to redeem myself fromthe first batch of grits.

07:30.795 --> 07:32.659
GORDON RAMSAY: The shrimp[inaudible] is amazing,

07:32.762 --> 07:34.039
destroyed by the grits.

07:34.143 --> 07:35.489
That's a three out of five.

07:35.593 --> 07:38.803
You could've got four haddo you nailed those grits.

07:38.906 --> 07:40.736
I'm going to show
Chef that I'm improving

07:40.839 --> 07:41.840
and nail these grits.

07:41.944 --> 07:43.048
Just like straight up grits.Right?

07:43.152 --> 07:44.015
Yeah.

07:44.118 --> 07:45.188
It's just grits,
cream, and butter.

07:45.292 --> 07:46.811
What is that, a pork and beef?

07:46.914 --> 07:48.260
Look like veal and beef.

07:48.364 --> 07:49.158
OK.

07:49.261 --> 07:50.228
I got this bitch right here.

07:50.331 --> 07:51.816
Nobody stepped up
and wanted cioppino.

07:51.919 --> 07:53.265
So I'm like, all
right, I'll take it.

07:53.369 --> 07:55.164
As much seafood as I've beendoing, it should be nothing.

07:55.267 --> 07:56.717
That's probably one
of the easier dishes

07:56.821 --> 07:57.684
to make right now.

07:57.787 --> 07:58.581
Everyone knows
what they're doing.

07:58.685 --> 07:59.996
Right?
ALL: Yes, Chef.

08:00.100 --> 08:04.311
GORDON RAMSAY: Good newsbecause one chef from each team

08:04.414 --> 08:08.522
is going to leave the
kitchen, right now.

08:08.626 --> 08:09.419
Hurry up.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.800
I have to stay right here.

08:10.904 --> 08:12.043
I'm not going anywhere.

08:12.146 --> 08:13.182
I'm staying.
- I'll go.

08:13.285 --> 08:14.079
I'm saying I'll go.

08:14.183 --> 08:15.667
This is good to go.

08:15.771 --> 08:18.083
Spaghetti and meatballs,definitely not a problem,

08:18.187 --> 08:20.707
so I feel that I can leave
the kitchen right now

08:20.810 --> 08:23.503
and be able to talksomeone through where I am.

08:23.606 --> 08:24.573
Decide.

08:24.676 --> 08:26.436
I mean, the picatta
is fairly simple.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.817
What else do you need to do?- Hey, go.

08:27.921 --> 08:28.749
Go.

08:28.853 --> 08:30.164
I got it.

08:30.268 --> 08:33.098
I was waiting to see who wasgoing to volunteer to go out?

08:33.202 --> 08:34.065
Bret?

08:34.168 --> 08:34.997
Wow.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.136
It's, like, why
would you remove

08:36.239 --> 08:37.447
yourself from the competition?

08:37.551 --> 08:38.828
The less people in
the kitchen right now,

08:38.932 --> 08:40.105
the more I get to shine.

08:40.209 --> 08:42.142
The only thing that vealneeds, Trevor, is salt

08:42.245 --> 08:43.695
and pepper before the sear.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.939
I opted to leave the kitchenfirst because I literally could

08:46.042 --> 08:47.423
walk my daughter
through this dish,

08:47.527 --> 08:49.321
so I can definitely
walk Trevor through it.

08:49.425 --> 08:53.118
But the picatta is searedhard, so you get the crisp.

08:53.222 --> 08:55.742
That has a nice
yellow tint to it, yeah?

08:55.845 --> 08:56.812
The [inaudible]?

08:56.915 --> 08:58.089
They're pretty white.

08:58.192 --> 08:59.504
Listen up.

08:59.608 --> 09:03.543
One more member of your teamhas to leave the kitchen now.

09:03.646 --> 09:04.889
Decide.

09:04.992 --> 09:06.200
It's shrimp and grits, guys.What do you want me to do?

09:06.304 --> 09:07.512
- Heather, Heather.
- Yeah?

09:07.616 --> 09:08.686
You're going to have tocream it out a little bit more.

09:08.789 --> 09:09.583
Yeah?
- All right.

09:09.687 --> 09:10.170
I got it.
- A little bit more

09:10.273 --> 09:11.654
I got it.

09:11.758 --> 09:13.069
- You want to take over, Motto?- I got it.

09:13.173 --> 09:14.381
I got it.
- The chick is down.

09:14.484 --> 09:15.796
This back-up chicken here.- Heard.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.039
Got you.
Go.

09:17.142 --> 09:18.143
Wake up, all of you.

09:18.247 --> 09:20.249
Let's go.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.146
Five people.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.044
Four people.

09:22.147 --> 09:23.045
Now three people.

09:23.148 --> 09:24.046
Red team, blue team.

09:24.149 --> 09:25.219
Do you understand
what's happening?

09:25.323 --> 09:26.220
Yes, Chef.

09:26.324 --> 09:28.119
I'm not liking
where this is going.

09:28.222 --> 09:30.259
CHEF: Meatballs about to
come off in 30 seconds.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.157
Extra flavor on
those meatballs, baby?

09:32.261 --> 09:33.711
Nice and fluffy

09:33.814 --> 09:35.885
Put the shallot down first,Mia, and then the peppers.

09:35.989 --> 09:37.128
You got the shrimp, Mia?

09:37.231 --> 09:38.370
Not yet.
OK.

09:38.474 --> 09:40.303
I'm going to season itwith some Korean peppers.

09:40.407 --> 09:41.891
Who got white wine?

09:41.995 --> 09:43.065
White wine right here.

09:43.168 --> 09:44.031
Here.
- We got some of that.

09:44.135 --> 09:44.963
Take it.
Go.

09:45.067 --> 09:45.861
Calm down.

09:45.964 --> 09:46.827
All right?

09:46.931 --> 09:47.932
This fish is
getting on my nerve.

09:48.035 --> 09:48.967
Red team, blue team.

09:49.071 --> 09:50.382
Listen up.

09:50.486 --> 09:54.386
One more member of your teamneeds to exit the kitchen now.

09:54.490 --> 09:55.525
Let's go.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.735
I'll stay on this side
because I got this good.

09:57.838 --> 09:59.426
So one of you guys has to go.

09:59.529 --> 10:00.323
Mia.

10:00.427 --> 10:01.221
I'm leaving.

10:01.324 --> 10:03.706
I have-- asparagus is on.

10:03.810 --> 10:05.225
My meatballs is in.
All right?

10:05.328 --> 10:06.226
That's what I'm saying.

10:06.329 --> 10:07.227
I'm doing my
thing to the sauces.

10:07.330 --> 10:07.917
[interposing voices]
Which, dog.

10:08.021 --> 10:08.815
Let's do it.

10:08.918 --> 10:09.747
Now.

10:09.850 --> 10:11.058
Add the white
wine to the sauce.

10:11.162 --> 10:11.645
All right?
- Heard.

10:11.749 --> 10:12.542
Heard.

10:12.646 --> 10:13.647
Drop the potatoes.

10:13.751 --> 10:15.062
Get those potatoes
in the fryer right now.

10:15.166 --> 10:16.029
All right.

10:16.132 --> 10:17.340
No more white wine.
It's enough.

10:17.444 --> 10:18.238
All right.

10:18.341 --> 10:19.135
Talk to me.

10:19.239 --> 10:20.102
Don't yell at me.

10:20.205 --> 10:21.448
Just do it.

10:21.551 --> 10:23.105
You know what you got todo for the cioppino, Trevor,

10:23.208 --> 10:24.175
correct?

10:24.278 --> 10:25.176
Yeah, the cioppino,
I'm getting ready

10:25.279 --> 10:26.073
so I can just boom and go.

10:26.177 --> 10:27.040
Perfect.

10:27.143 --> 10:28.282
Motto's got shrimp
and grits going.

10:28.386 --> 10:29.732
[interposing voices]
- Looking good.

10:29.836 --> 10:30.975
Shrimp and grits.

10:31.078 --> 10:34.392
Salty, buttery, creamy,sexy, like bang-bang, baby.

10:34.495 --> 10:36.256
Bret, I've got you,
buddy, but you're

10:36.359 --> 10:38.051
getting way too into this dish.

10:38.154 --> 10:40.709
Sexy, cheesy,
buttery, salty grits.

10:40.812 --> 10:41.917
TREVOR: Nice and silky, baby.

10:42.020 --> 10:43.021
Beautiful.

10:43.125 --> 10:45.299
The last member your
team needs to leave.

10:45.403 --> 10:46.231
Now.

10:46.335 --> 10:47.681
Decide, quickly.
- Really?

10:47.785 --> 10:49.269
Get out, Trev.
Who's coming out?

10:49.372 --> 10:49.959
GORDON RAMSAY: Who's coming out?Decide.

10:50.063 --> 10:50.960
Trevor's getting out.

10:51.064 --> 10:52.721
Trevor has to go
because when it comes

10:52.824 --> 10:57.070
down to being under pressure,he really can't handle it.

10:57.173 --> 10:58.347
One member, out now.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.244
All right.

10:59.348 --> 11:00.590
Coming out.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.834
There's no way you coulddrag me out of this kitchen.

11:02.938 --> 11:03.732
This is mine.

11:03.835 --> 11:04.836
I got this.

11:04.940 --> 11:06.562
That's not the way
I wanted him to do it.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.150
- What do you want to do, Kanae?- I'm good.

11:08.253 --> 11:09.185
- Decide.
- Kanae.

11:09.289 --> 11:10.739
Kanae.
Kanae.

11:10.842 --> 11:11.878
OK.

11:11.981 --> 11:14.639
I'm 100% prepared to
kick it into high gear

11:14.743 --> 11:16.158
and win this challenge.

11:16.261 --> 11:17.987
You got that veal
in the pan, correct?

11:18.816 --> 11:19.402
Not yet.
He's good.

11:19.506 --> 11:20.369
Get it in.
Heard.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.301
He's good.
[interposing voices]

11:21.404 --> 11:22.336
He's good.
He's good [inaudible].

11:22.440 --> 11:23.579
Trevor's running
his mouth too much.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.581
You need to have a flameif you're going to cook.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.169
Trev, I got that part, buddy.

11:27.272 --> 11:30.172
That shit is really
getting on my nerves.

11:30.275 --> 11:31.069
I'm looking out for you.

11:31.173 --> 11:31.967
Heard that.

11:36.903 --> 11:38.870
It feels like
I'm on fire inside.

11:38.974 --> 11:40.527
I'm just going to hitit with butter at the end.

11:40.630 --> 11:42.874
I don't need any
help from anyone.

11:42.978 --> 11:45.394
Meatballs are going in
the sauce, [inaudible]..

11:45.497 --> 11:47.396
Red team, blue team.

11:47.499 --> 11:48.949

Oh, yeah.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.543

11:56.646 --> 11:59.408
I really think I could havegot it all together myself.

11:59.511 --> 12:02.066
At the same time, I am
welcoming my teammates.

12:02.169 --> 12:03.308
- Take it easy.

12:03.412 --> 12:04.447
Everybody focus.

Yeah, I'll do the pasta.

12:08.486 --> 12:09.452
Where's the parm?

12:09.556 --> 12:10.591
GORDON RAMSAY:
Everybody's plating.

NARRATOR: In today's Last ChefStanding challenge, each team

12:57.086 --> 13:01.194
is scrambling to plate fivepopular classic entrees,

13:01.297 --> 13:02.298
while one chef--

13:02.402 --> 13:03.265
GORDON RAMSAY: Come on, Bret.

13:03.368 --> 13:04.887
NARRATOR: --is
running out of time.

13:04.991 --> 13:05.715
Sauce it.
GORDON RAMSAY: Five.

13:05.819 --> 13:06.647
Four.

13:06.751 --> 13:07.579

You had it.

13:13.758 --> 13:14.759
CHEF: I got to sauce, though.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.076
Before this challenge
I told all of you

13:21.179 --> 13:23.216
how important it was
to stay connected

13:23.319 --> 13:24.838
and to work as a team.

13:24.942 --> 13:25.874
Let's face it.

13:25.977 --> 13:28.152
Every dinner service,
there's always

13:28.255 --> 13:30.810
one chef that has to pickup the slack from another.

13:30.913 --> 13:32.742
That happens in mykitchen on a daily basis.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.227
Someone gets in theweeds, you help them out.

13:34.330 --> 13:35.711
Right?
ALL: Yes, Chef.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.195
OK.
Good.

13:37.299 --> 13:38.645
Let's start off with
the shrimp and grits.

13:38.748 --> 13:40.095
Pass them down, please.
Thank you.

13:40.198 --> 13:41.510
CHEF: OK.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.408
GORDON RAMSAY: Blue team, whowas responsible for this one?

13:44.168 --> 13:44.858
CHEF: Chef, I was.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.037
Grits slightly anemic.

13:51.140 --> 13:52.176
Yeah.

13:52.279 --> 13:56.111
So I don't see that
mature cheddar in that.

13:56.214 --> 14:01.150
Please tell me the man fromBaton Rouge nailed this.

14:01.254 --> 14:02.565
Wow.

14:02.669 --> 14:05.223
I mean, that is extraordinary.

14:05.327 --> 14:08.295
Winner of this round, by
a mile, is the red team.

14:08.399 --> 14:09.503
Nice job, Motto.

14:09.607 --> 14:11.678
One point and
I'm feeling good.

14:11.781 --> 14:13.853
I wasn't going to fuck upmine in the midst of cooking

14:13.956 --> 14:15.233
all these other ones.

14:15.337 --> 14:17.477
NARRATOR: As Motto gets the redteam off to a strong start--

14:17.580 --> 14:18.374
OK.

14:18.478 --> 14:19.755
Let's go.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.619
NARRATOR: --Kanae we'll tryto bring the blue team back

14:21.722 --> 14:25.347
as she faces off with Jose inthe battle of fried chicken.

14:29.903 --> 14:30.697
Chicken's delicious.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.699
Wow.

14:32.802 --> 14:33.596
OK.

14:37.566 --> 14:39.257
It tastes good.

14:39.361 --> 14:41.190
Really nicely seasoned.

14:41.294 --> 14:43.537
That point goes to red team.

14:43.641 --> 14:45.022
Thank you, Chef.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.368
And the blue team.

14:46.471 --> 14:47.645
Thank you, Chef.

14:47.748 --> 14:51.614
GORDON RAMSAY: Next
up, veal scallopini.

14:51.718 --> 14:52.512
OK.

14:52.615 --> 14:53.582
Visually, they both look great.

14:53.685 --> 14:54.479
Yeah.

14:54.583 --> 14:55.791
I'm not feeling good.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.137
The veal picatta is somethingI do often, you know.

14:57.241 --> 14:58.483
It's a banging-assed
dish, and it's

14:58.587 --> 15:01.590
served on every Italian-Americanrestaurant in the country.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.557
Slightly concerned,
the fact that I've got

15:03.661 --> 15:05.180
no color on here whatsoever.

15:05.283 --> 15:06.043
Oh, dear.

15:09.287 --> 15:12.290
That's chewy and that
doesn't have the magic

15:12.394 --> 15:16.432
of a delicate, melting veal.

15:16.536 --> 15:18.331
Bret, you're supposed
to be Mr. Italian.

15:18.434 --> 15:20.160
This is an Italian dish, man.

15:20.264 --> 15:21.058
Where are you at?

15:21.161 --> 15:22.749
What happened to your veal?

15:22.852 --> 15:24.578
Blue team, who cooked
the veal on here?

15:24.682 --> 15:25.476
I did, Chef.

15:29.031 --> 15:31.516
The plate, by a
mile, is the blue team.

15:31.620 --> 15:32.586
Great job.
- Thank you.

15:32.690 --> 15:33.484
That is delicious.

15:33.587 --> 15:34.623
Really good.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.694
We have a tie with two left.

15:36.797 --> 15:37.971
Spaghetti and meatballs.

15:38.075 --> 15:39.283
Let's good.

15:39.386 --> 15:40.215
OK.

15:40.318 --> 15:41.147
Thank you.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.562
Red team, the meatballs.

15:42.665 --> 15:43.943
Who cooked them?

15:44.046 --> 15:46.255
I cooked them, Chef, andit was finished off by Motto.

15:49.949 --> 15:50.742
Wow.

15:50.846 --> 15:52.020
That's good.

15:52.123 --> 15:52.952
Delicious.

15:53.055 --> 15:55.368
It's soft and it's really good.

15:55.471 --> 15:57.542
Could've done with
a bit more sauce.

15:57.646 --> 15:58.612
Right.

15:58.716 --> 15:59.751
Who was responsible
for the meatballs?

15:59.855 --> 16:00.649
I was, Chef.

16:02.892 --> 16:03.686
Wow.

16:03.790 --> 16:05.895
That's soft as well.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.138
Wow.

16:07.242 --> 16:08.968
This is really tough.

16:09.071 --> 16:13.144
The point goes to the redteam and the blue team.

16:13.248 --> 16:14.042
Yes.

16:14.145 --> 16:15.008
Right.

16:15.112 --> 16:16.734
So we have a tie
with one dish left.

16:16.837 --> 16:17.942
Cioppinos.

16:18.046 --> 16:19.737
Let's go.
OK.

16:19.840 --> 16:20.772
Blue team.

16:20.876 --> 16:23.844
Visually, it looks beautiful.

16:23.948 --> 16:25.122
Beautifully seasoned.

16:25.225 --> 16:27.952
Really good, indeed.

16:28.056 --> 16:28.849
Wow.

16:28.953 --> 16:30.575
Thank you, Chef.

16:30.679 --> 16:33.164
Red team, who plated
the ingredients?

16:33.268 --> 16:34.165
I did, Chef.

16:34.269 --> 16:35.063
All of it?

16:35.166 --> 16:35.960
Yes, chef.

16:39.136 --> 16:40.378
They're actually
cooked juicily.

16:40.482 --> 16:41.517
Did use any of
the cooking juices

16:41.621 --> 16:42.760
from the clams and the mussels?- Oh, yeah.

16:42.863 --> 16:44.210
I did.
Everything was in there.

16:44.313 --> 16:45.107
That's the essence.

16:45.211 --> 16:46.936
That's the magic you can't buy.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.248
Delicious.
- Thank you.

16:48.352 --> 16:49.146
Really good, indeed.

16:49.249 --> 16:50.802
The dish of the day.

16:55.876 --> 16:57.085
Thank you, chef.

16:57.188 --> 16:59.018
It's just a shame you'remissing a key ingredient.

17:03.263 --> 17:05.024
Oh, mother f--

17:05.127 --> 17:06.473
GORDON RAMSAY: What's
wrong with your dish?

17:06.577 --> 17:08.027
I forgot to put the
fish on the plate.

17:11.754 --> 17:15.310
It's sitting right there, too.

17:15.413 --> 17:16.173
Oh my god.

17:16.276 --> 17:17.484
I can't believe this guy.

17:17.588 --> 17:19.590
He was the first person
to put his dish up,

17:19.693 --> 17:21.626
and he left out
the friggin' fish.

17:21.730 --> 17:24.319
Don't act like the bossif you not the boss, man.

17:24.422 --> 17:25.837
What a shame.

17:25.941 --> 17:28.495
I'm having flashbacks
to my season.

17:28.599 --> 17:29.634
Where is your puree?

17:29.738 --> 17:31.740
Sitting behind you.

17:31.843 --> 17:33.673
Why did you make astunning puree like that,

17:33.776 --> 17:35.123
and then not put
it on the plate?

17:35.226 --> 17:36.158
Spaced out.

17:36.262 --> 17:38.229
You would've been
the only one right.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.162
You're supposed tolearn from your mistakes.

17:40.266 --> 17:41.681
I guess I don't.

17:41.784 --> 17:43.096
The winner is the blue team.

17:43.200 --> 17:43.993
Congratulations.

17:44.097 --> 17:44.891
Yes.

17:47.238 --> 17:48.964
It feels amazing right now.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.311
I feel like we've worked
really well as a team.

17:51.415 --> 17:53.762
Yet again I've pulled myweight during a challenge,

17:53.865 --> 17:55.971
and I want to just keep
this momentum going.

17:56.075 --> 18:00.009
I hope you're ready for afast-paced, hilarious day.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.045
Go-kart racing.

18:01.149 --> 18:02.046
Yes

18:03.047 --> 18:03.841
That's awesome.

18:03.944 --> 18:04.738
Excited?

18:04.842 --> 18:06.015
Yes, Chef.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.845
Men, any tips for the
girls before they go?

18:07.948 --> 18:09.985
Crash.

18:10.089 --> 18:10.882
Man.

18:10.986 --> 18:13.920
Crash like you guys did today?

18:14.023 --> 18:15.370
Man.

18:15.473 --> 18:16.785
Give a round of applause.Come on.

18:16.888 --> 18:17.993
Off you go.
Well done.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.581
Ariel, good job.
Kanae, great job.

18:19.684 --> 18:20.478
Well done.

18:20.582 --> 18:21.790
Thank you.

18:21.893 --> 18:23.964
Men, you're in
for a difficult day.

18:24.068 --> 18:26.001
Today, Scotley,
would you believe,

18:26.105 --> 18:28.072
is delivery day here
in "Hell's Kitchen."

18:28.176 --> 18:30.868
Bushels and bushels ofcorn on the cob and peas.

18:30.971 --> 18:33.664
Shucking every little
ear of corn by hand.

18:33.767 --> 18:35.562
And those peas-- well,they're still in the pot,

18:35.666 --> 18:37.081
so remove them gently.

18:37.185 --> 18:38.358
It's a tough day ahead.

18:38.462 --> 18:40.429
Trev, just come
down here a minute.

18:40.533 --> 18:41.810
Bring that cioppino.

18:41.913 --> 18:44.709
You've got al little
pit stop here.

18:44.813 --> 18:45.952
On my say, go.

18:46.055 --> 18:46.849
Yeah.

18:46.953 --> 18:47.850
Stop what you got.

18:47.954 --> 18:49.300
Stop watch is on.
Ready?

18:49.404 --> 18:50.301
Remember the pit crew?

18:50.405 --> 18:53.304
I'm pulling in, vroom,
and 3, 2, 1, go.

18:53.408 --> 18:54.202
Time?

18:54.305 --> 18:57.101
1.16.

18:57.205 --> 18:59.379
Amazing.

18:59.483 --> 19:01.312
I'm feeling pretty beat down.

19:01.416 --> 19:03.142
I worked up a big
sweat just now,

19:03.245 --> 19:06.248
so Trev leaving the fish offis kind of disappointing.

19:06.352 --> 19:07.525
What the fuck, man.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.565
Start handing
me stuff, please,

19:12.668 --> 19:13.635
and I'll put it on the tables.

19:13.738 --> 19:15.671
Make sure those 10
of the corn, please.

19:15.775 --> 19:16.603
[inaudible]

19:16.707 --> 19:20.159
This is all on Trevor.

19:20.262 --> 19:21.643
He knows he fucked up today.

19:24.715 --> 19:25.716
I'm breaking out
from something.

19:25.819 --> 19:26.648
Peas?

19:26.751 --> 19:27.787
You think it's the peas?

19:27.890 --> 19:29.029
I don't know, butit's-- yeah, it's running

19:29.133 --> 19:30.514
all the way up my arms now.
- Itchy?

19:30.617 --> 19:31.756
Yeah.

19:31.860 --> 19:34.311
First, I left my dish offthe plate, and now this.

19:34.414 --> 19:36.934
Sometimes enough's enoughand a man needs a break.

19:37.037 --> 19:38.556
- Oh, shit what is that?
- I don't know.

19:38.660 --> 19:39.868
- Are you allergic?
- Something is.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.007
OK.

19:41.110 --> 19:42.457
You need to just get
looked at real quick.

19:42.560 --> 19:43.389
Hold on one second.

19:46.840 --> 19:50.292
Trevor's doing anythingto kind of mask his fuck up.

19:50.396 --> 19:53.571
You know, he's running aroundwith his arms itching him,

19:53.675 --> 19:55.780
and he's acting like
he's about to die.

19:55.884 --> 19:58.058
My hands, they're bleeding.

19:58.162 --> 19:59.405
Stop acting like a baby girl.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.415
NARRATOR: The red team is inthe midst of a punishing day

20:09.518 --> 20:10.312
at "Hell's Kitchen."

20:10.416 --> 20:11.589
Oh, shit what is that?

20:11.693 --> 20:12.521
I don't know.

20:12.625 --> 20:13.419
Are you allergic?

20:13.522 --> 20:14.420
Something is.

20:14.523 --> 20:15.869
SCOTLEY: My hands,
they're bleeding.

20:15.973 --> 20:18.424
NARRATOR: And the tensionbetween Scotley and Trevor

20:18.527 --> 20:21.012
has finally hit a fever pitch.

20:21.116 --> 20:24.050
SCOTLEY: Stop like a baby girl.

20:24.153 --> 20:25.016
All right.

20:25.120 --> 20:27.226
Scotley, just shut the fuck up.

20:27.329 --> 20:28.882
I got a little
bit of a irritation,

20:28.986 --> 20:30.298
a little rash going on here.

20:30.401 --> 20:32.127
The itching is getting
more and more pronounced

20:32.231 --> 20:33.577
as time's ticking by.

20:33.680 --> 20:34.509
Both sides?

20:34.612 --> 20:35.544
Yeah, both sides.

20:35.648 --> 20:36.649
Clear gels.

20:36.752 --> 20:37.891
They tend to work a
little bit quicker.

20:37.995 --> 20:39.272
- OK.- We'll start with just one.

20:39.376 --> 20:40.377
I'm allergic to something.

20:40.480 --> 20:43.242
Maybe it's all
these punishments.

20:43.345 --> 20:44.691
Where prima donna at, man?

20:44.795 --> 20:48.730
He's still got his
pussy looked at?

20:48.833 --> 20:50.594
You all right, baby girl?

20:50.697 --> 20:51.767
Funny.

20:51.871 --> 20:53.182
I was wondering what's
wrong with [inaudible]..

20:53.286 --> 20:54.908
Well, they had to make
sure it was going away.

20:55.012 --> 20:56.289
- Is it?
- Yeah.

20:56.393 --> 20:58.671
Now I don't like this babygirl shit, and any of the crap

20:58.774 --> 21:00.017
that comes out of his mouth.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.088
I haven't come at you withany name calling or anything.

21:02.191 --> 21:03.469
This isn't high school.

21:03.572 --> 21:04.677
Grow up.

21:04.780 --> 21:06.851
Busted that out
pretty fast, I think.

21:06.955 --> 21:10.579
Yeah, after you had to dealwith your little rash and shit.

21:10.683 --> 21:12.305
Oh, you saying that youguys took care of all this

21:12.409 --> 21:12.857
without me?

21:12.961 --> 21:13.686
I don't care.

21:13.789 --> 21:15.032
Baby girl, we got your back.

21:15.135 --> 21:16.620
I see how it is.

21:16.723 --> 21:19.657
If I call Trevor
one more name,

21:19.761 --> 21:22.488
he's going to explode
because baby girl

21:22.591 --> 21:24.455
really gets under his skin.

21:24.559 --> 21:26.423
Baby girl, come on, you
ain't doing nothing.

21:30.496 --> 21:31.290
Haters going to hate.

21:37.054 --> 21:37.848
Come on, ladies.

21:37.951 --> 21:39.884
Let's do this.

21:39.988 --> 21:41.300
- Blue team.
- [inaudible]

21:41.403 --> 21:41.817
- The need.
- [inaudible]

21:41.921 --> 21:43.025
The need

21:43.129 --> 21:45.234
The need for speed.

21:45.338 --> 21:47.513
This is absolutely amazing.

21:47.616 --> 21:49.894
And I cannot wait to get
that helmet on and get

21:49.998 --> 21:50.826
in one of those cars.

21:56.384 --> 21:57.350
Oh, man.

21:57.454 --> 21:59.179
The whole time I'm
hugging every corner.

21:59.283 --> 22:01.665
I'm trying to stay on people'stails and lapping some people.

22:01.768 --> 22:02.976
So I was feeling
pretty good about that.

22:07.809 --> 22:11.295
It feels good to just
have a different type

22:11.399 --> 22:13.090
of adrenaline rush.

22:13.193 --> 22:17.612
Not with Chef Ramsay
in front of your face.

22:17.715 --> 22:19.545
Kanae is this
little wild child--

22:19.648 --> 22:21.305
I'm coming for you, Heather.

22:21.409 --> 22:24.998
--because she hits
me, it's like, this

22:25.102 --> 22:26.206
girl's going to spend me out.

22:34.007 --> 22:36.424
I was going really slow.

22:36.527 --> 22:37.770
I'm not a good driver.

22:37.873 --> 22:39.944
You know, I like this to speed,but I don't trust myself.

22:47.711 --> 22:48.815
NARRATOR: The
women have returned

22:48.919 --> 22:52.198
from their high-octanereward, and all the chefs

22:52.301 --> 22:54.787
are taking a rare moment
to relax before they

22:54.890 --> 22:56.754
prep for dinner service.

22:56.858 --> 22:58.135
I'm really looking
forward to service

22:58.238 --> 23:01.276
because I think the six of uscan do some serious damage.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.244
I actually really want
to be on the station

23:04.348 --> 23:06.868
alone because then you
have nobody to lean on.

23:06.971 --> 23:08.456
I have no expectation.

23:08.559 --> 23:09.905
It's just me.

23:10.009 --> 23:12.252
Earlier in the day, Gizzywas the first one to say,

23:12.356 --> 23:13.150
"I'll sit out."

23:17.326 --> 23:19.121
I think she gets inside
her own head still

23:19.225 --> 23:22.331
and that comfortableness in thekitchen comes from experience.

23:22.435 --> 23:26.405
My whole problem was that Ijust wasn't competent in it.

23:26.508 --> 23:27.613
And that will come, you know.

23:27.716 --> 23:29.166
You're going to get someservices under your belt.

23:29.269 --> 23:30.409
GIZZY: Roe definitely
has my back

23:30.512 --> 23:32.894
because she knows exactlywhat kind of mental game

23:32.997 --> 23:34.136
is happening right now.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.379
She's gone through this process.

23:35.483 --> 23:37.416
She knows how to
get around this.

23:37.519 --> 23:38.589
I think get so
wrapped up in that

23:38.693 --> 23:39.728
it's a competition,
that we forget

23:39.832 --> 23:40.626
it's a fucking restaurant.

23:40.729 --> 23:41.523
You know?

23:41.627 --> 23:42.662
Think about what you do at work.

23:42.766 --> 23:43.836
You know what I mean?

23:43.939 --> 23:46.390
Don't act any different
how you would at home.

23:46.494 --> 23:47.874
It's not that much different.

23:47.978 --> 23:49.393
It's the same as a
fucking restaurant.

23:49.497 --> 23:50.290
Exactly.

23:54.225 --> 23:55.468
Hello?

23:55.572 --> 23:57.366
I'd like to see everybodyin the dining room

23:57.470 --> 23:59.058
through the red
kitchen urgently.

23:59.161 --> 24:00.335
- Heard.
- That was Chef.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.232
Come on, guys.

24:03.925 --> 24:05.927
Good evening, Chefs.

24:06.030 --> 24:07.342
Good evening, Chef.
GORDON RAMSAY: Let's go.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.930
Chef.
GORDON RAMSAY: Line up.

24:09.033 --> 24:11.829
Right.

24:11.933 --> 24:13.935
What is going on
because obviously,

24:14.038 --> 24:15.902
it's not set for dinner service.

24:16.006 --> 24:18.664
Let me confirm something
very important.

24:18.767 --> 24:21.977
There's definitely no dinnerservice, but rest assured,

24:22.081 --> 24:25.153
minutes from now, the kitchensbehind you will be very busy.

24:25.256 --> 24:27.431
As you can see, your
sous chefs and I

24:27.535 --> 24:31.055
have transformed this diningroom into a beautiful farmer's

24:31.159 --> 24:35.059
market stocked with some ofthe most amazing hand-picked

24:35.163 --> 24:36.682
and seasonal
ingredients that you'll

24:36.785 --> 24:38.442
find anywhere in the country.

24:38.546 --> 24:41.618
As chefs, there
is no greater joy

24:41.721 --> 24:46.346
than walking through and lettingyour imagination run wild.

24:46.450 --> 24:49.557
Every chef's dream
is in front of us.

24:49.660 --> 24:54.147
This place just offers you thebest of the culinary world.

24:54.251 --> 24:55.873
Here's the thing.

24:55.977 --> 24:59.981
Tonight, I'm trimming the fat.

25:03.743 --> 25:07.678
Not all of you will be competingin this challenge tonight.

25:07.782 --> 25:11.924
This morning, the chefs
who stood their ground

25:12.027 --> 25:17.723
and stayed in the
kitchen are safe.

25:17.826 --> 25:23.418
The first three chefs who werewilling to leave their kitchen

25:23.522 --> 25:25.834
will be cooking for their lives.

25:25.938 --> 25:27.940
Shoot up, Sally, becausethings are about to get

25:28.043 --> 25:29.666
real, real fucking fast.

25:29.769 --> 25:31.115
Didn't see this one
coming, did you?

25:31.219 --> 25:32.669
Neither did I.

25:32.772 --> 25:33.566
[music playing]

25:43.334 --> 25:44.957
NARRATOR: The chefs
have arrived expecting

25:45.060 --> 25:46.855
a normal dinner
service, but Chef

25:46.959 --> 25:48.995
Ramsay has dropped a bomb--

25:49.099 --> 25:51.998
I'm trimming the fat.

25:52.102 --> 25:54.898
--introducing the secondchallenge of the day--

25:55.001 --> 25:59.178
This morning the chefs
who stood their ground

25:59.281 --> 26:04.079
and stayed in the
kitchen are safe.

26:04.183 --> 26:06.530
NARRATOR: --with one
very important twist.

26:06.634 --> 26:12.260
The first three chefs who werewilling to leave the kitchen

26:12.363 --> 26:15.125
will be cooking for their lives.

26:15.228 --> 26:16.678
Damn, Chef Ramsay.

26:16.782 --> 26:19.232
You dropped the bomb on me, man.

26:19.336 --> 26:21.614
And the weakest
performer tonight will

26:21.718 --> 26:23.927
be leaving "Hell's Kitchen."

26:24.030 --> 26:25.894
I know that I'm going to bein this challenge right here.

26:25.998 --> 26:27.689
That I've got to
fight for my bed right

26:27.793 --> 26:28.794
here in "Hell's Kitchen."

26:28.897 --> 26:30.312
Let's fucking do it.

26:30.416 --> 26:33.557
On the blue team, thethree cooking for your lives

26:33.661 --> 26:37.596
are Gizzy, Roe, and Heather.

26:37.699 --> 26:38.666
Yes, Chef.

26:38.769 --> 26:45.155
On the red team,
Bret, Jose, and Scotley.

26:45.258 --> 26:47.709
I'm cooking for my life.

26:47.813 --> 26:51.092
The game has just begun.

26:51.195 --> 26:52.714
Say goodbye to
your fellow chefs

26:52.818 --> 26:55.821
because this could be the lasttime you'll ever see them.

26:55.924 --> 26:57.201
Good luck, brothers.

26:57.305 --> 26:59.963
I cannot believe that justdoing what came naturally

27:00.066 --> 27:02.137
to me just earned me immunity.

27:02.241 --> 27:03.725
You got this, girl.

27:03.829 --> 27:06.555
It bites me in the ass tobe one of the first three

27:06.659 --> 27:10.352
to walk out of the kitchenon our previous challenge.

27:10.456 --> 27:13.114
I could kick myself inthe ass if I could reach.

27:13.217 --> 27:14.494
You six.

27:14.598 --> 27:18.637
You've all got 25 minutes tohead into this market, shop,

27:18.740 --> 27:23.055
and create one
spectacular entree.

27:23.158 --> 27:24.194
Is that clear?

27:24.297 --> 27:25.160
ALL: Yes, Chef.

27:25.264 --> 27:27.680
The time starts now.

27:27.784 --> 27:28.577
Good luck.

27:31.857 --> 27:33.306
BRET: Let it shine.

27:33.410 --> 27:35.170
We have the opportunity
to literally make

27:35.274 --> 27:38.587
whatever the fuck we
want to make sure we

27:38.691 --> 27:40.175
stay in "Hell's Kitchen."

27:40.279 --> 27:41.832
Shit.

27:41.936 --> 27:43.351
Gizzy, what are you doing?

27:43.454 --> 27:45.284
The snapper are a littlebigger than I thought, Chef.

27:45.387 --> 27:46.319
Wow.

27:46.423 --> 27:48.805
Complaining about
the snapper size.

27:48.908 --> 27:50.461
Feel good?

27:50.565 --> 27:51.600
- Yeah, I'm good.
- OK.

27:51.704 --> 27:52.878
Me, too.

27:52.981 --> 27:54.396
What are you making?

27:54.500 --> 27:57.745
A chorizo, a potato,
a charred corn hash.

27:57.848 --> 27:58.849
Back home, I have
a lot of people

27:58.953 --> 28:00.817
depending on me--
my wife and my kids.

28:00.920 --> 28:02.922
So in my mind, I'm notonly saving my life here,

28:03.026 --> 28:05.545
but I want to make my wife proudand show her I'm definitely not

28:05.649 --> 28:06.443
only here for me.

28:06.546 --> 28:07.340
Stay focused.

28:07.444 --> 28:08.272
Calm finesse on the plate.

28:08.376 --> 28:10.240
OK?

28:10.343 --> 28:12.380
Ladies, we're going tosend one of them home, yeah?

28:12.483 --> 28:14.762
Heather, this is
not a team challenge.

28:14.865 --> 28:16.418
This is me against the world.

28:16.522 --> 28:18.351
So I'm not going
to sacrifice even

28:18.455 --> 28:20.768
a millisecond of
my precious time

28:20.871 --> 28:21.907
to make sure that they're OK.

28:22.010 --> 28:23.253
What are you going
to do [inaudible]??

28:23.356 --> 28:25.531
I'm going to do a grilledswordfish, purple cauliflower

28:25.634 --> 28:26.739
puree.

28:26.843 --> 28:30.225
Then I'm going to slowroast these baby carrots.

28:30.329 --> 28:31.882
Oh, this is the best.

28:31.986 --> 28:34.195
I'm going to super-super rustic.

28:34.298 --> 28:35.196
What are you going to make?

28:35.299 --> 28:36.853
I'm going to
simply grill it whole

28:36.956 --> 28:38.061
and just be inspired
by the market

28:38.164 --> 28:39.718
because this is
what I love to do.

28:39.821 --> 28:40.788
Yep.

28:40.891 --> 28:42.548
This dish willdefinitely save me tonight

28:42.651 --> 28:45.171
because this is the first
time in this competition

28:45.275 --> 28:46.207
I'm not over thinking it.

28:46.310 --> 28:48.381
I'm just doing
what's true to me.

28:48.485 --> 28:50.590
Just over 25
minutes remaining.

28:50.694 --> 28:51.488
Yes, Chef.

28:51.591 --> 28:52.385
OK?

28:52.489 --> 28:55.009
One stunning portion.

28:55.112 --> 28:57.321
How's your oregano
coming into play?

28:57.425 --> 28:59.392
It's going to be cooked
in with my lentils.

28:59.496 --> 29:00.531
Nice.

29:00.635 --> 29:03.224
You don't see people
cook lentils when it

29:03.327 --> 29:05.260
comes to a fresh ahi tuna fish.

29:05.364 --> 29:06.192
You know?

29:06.296 --> 29:08.263
You see light salads.

29:08.367 --> 29:09.471
- Lentils?
- Yep.

29:09.575 --> 29:10.714
Fuck yeah.

29:10.818 --> 29:14.649
This is me as a
very unorthodox chef.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.169
I want to show Chef Ramsaythat I can step out the box.

29:17.272 --> 29:18.480
Go hard or go home.

29:18.584 --> 29:20.759
My squad ain't goingnowhere today, baby, let's go.

29:20.862 --> 29:21.967
Pick it up, Red-red.
- Yeah.

29:22.070 --> 29:22.968
Let's go, man.

29:23.071 --> 29:24.832
I'm making pasta tonight.

29:24.935 --> 29:27.317
And I put together a, truthof the matter, if you would,

29:27.420 --> 29:28.490
seafood pasta.

29:28.594 --> 29:29.871
Half of the
ingredients in my dish

29:29.975 --> 29:31.873
are literally
tattooed on my body.

29:31.977 --> 29:33.564
I'll be happy with thatin an Italian restaurant.

29:33.668 --> 29:34.945
19 minutes.

29:35.049 --> 29:37.292
Yes, Chef.

29:37.396 --> 29:38.604
What are you doing there?

29:38.707 --> 29:40.261
Chef, I'm going to do thebutter-poached lobster tail

29:40.364 --> 29:41.952
with a little bit of curry,and I'm going to finish

29:42.056 --> 29:42.988
it with a pineapple salsa.

29:43.091 --> 29:44.127
Yep.

29:44.230 --> 29:46.267
I want to be part of
Chef Ramsay's empire.

29:46.370 --> 29:47.924
I have a lot weighing
on me right now to try

29:48.027 --> 29:49.477
to better my life for my son.

29:55.138 --> 29:56.104
I'm going to be safe tonight.

29:56.208 --> 29:57.519
I'm not going home.

29:57.623 --> 29:58.589
Two minutes.

29:58.693 --> 29:59.521
ALL: Yes, Chef.

29:59.625 --> 30:00.384
[inaudible] at me.

30:00.488 --> 30:04.319
This thing is hot.

30:04.423 --> 30:05.424
60 seconds to go.

30:05.527 --> 30:06.494
Make it count.

30:06.597 --> 30:07.460
Ooh, that's hot.

30:10.325 --> 30:11.602
20 seconds to go.

30:11.706 --> 30:12.776
I'm there.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.813
Make sure you have
time to wipe down.

30:14.916 --> 30:15.710
GORDON RAMSAY: Ten.

30:15.814 --> 30:16.711
Nine.

30:16.815 --> 30:17.712
Eight.

30:17.816 --> 30:18.713
Seven.

30:18.817 --> 30:19.714
Six.

30:19.818 --> 30:20.715
Five.

30:20.819 --> 30:21.681
Four.

30:21.785 --> 30:23.166
Three.
Two.

30:23.269 --> 30:24.132
One.

30:24.236 --> 30:25.099
And serve.

30:25.202 --> 30:25.996
Well done.

30:29.034 --> 30:30.932
So who do we think's going?

30:31.036 --> 30:33.762
I'm torn between
Gizzy or Heather.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.178
I have no clue, either,
that's why I said,

30:35.281 --> 30:36.282
I was like, I'm
not leaving here.

30:36.386 --> 30:37.594
Jose's going to
be OK, I think.

30:37.697 --> 30:38.595
I think.
So too.

30:38.698 --> 30:39.734
Yeah.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.909
It's going to come
down to Scotley or Bret.

30:42.012 --> 30:43.945
Everybody knows I want
to see Scotley gone.

30:44.049 --> 30:45.326
Nobody likes a bully.

30:45.429 --> 30:46.948
You've got a big mouth, butyou're not really a listener.

30:47.052 --> 30:48.260
You're very fucking selfish.All right.

30:48.363 --> 30:49.192
Get out of here.

30:49.295 --> 30:51.504
It's getting real again.

30:51.608 --> 30:52.851
Right.

30:52.954 --> 30:55.267
Roe, please, bring your dish up.

30:55.370 --> 30:58.270
I'm here to be ChefRamsay's next head chef, so.

30:58.373 --> 30:59.202
I like this dish.

30:59.305 --> 31:00.617
I'm proud of this dish.

31:00.720 --> 31:01.790
Thank you.

31:01.894 --> 31:04.414
Hopefully it's not the
dish that I go home on.

31:04.517 --> 31:07.210
The swordfish, it's beenbasted in a kaffir-lime butter

31:07.313 --> 31:09.557
balanced with a raspberry,crabapple and pomegranate

31:09.660 --> 31:10.489
sauce.

31:10.592 --> 31:13.630
Visually, it looks beautiful.

31:13.733 --> 31:14.665
Delicious.

31:14.769 --> 31:15.563
Thank you.

31:15.666 --> 31:16.944
Thank you, Chef.

31:17.047 --> 31:18.773
The question is how doesit compare to everybody else?

31:18.877 --> 31:20.154
If you beat the
next person, then

31:20.257 --> 31:21.880
you have a pass to the door.

31:21.983 --> 31:22.777
Thank you, Chef.

31:22.881 --> 31:26.056
Next up, Bret.

31:26.160 --> 31:27.955
It's literally buffet
on the [inaudible]..

31:28.058 --> 31:31.406
You know, seafood,
pasta, sexy, simple.

31:31.510 --> 31:33.581
Chef, I've prepared
a frutti di Mare.

31:33.684 --> 31:36.342
Clams, mussels,
some grilled shrimp

31:36.446 --> 31:39.621
with pan-seared scallops,served in a Pomodoro sauce.

31:39.725 --> 31:41.209
This is plucked
straight from the sea.

31:41.313 --> 31:42.072
Thank you, Chef.

31:44.972 --> 31:47.146
Really good, Bret.

31:47.250 --> 31:48.044
Head back in line.

31:48.147 --> 31:49.631
Thank you, Chef.

31:49.735 --> 31:51.875
Wow.

31:51.979 --> 31:54.774
Two good dishes, butthere's one that highlights

31:54.878 --> 31:57.467
the skill beyond belief.

31:57.570 --> 31:58.951
Chef, you're killing me.

31:59.055 --> 32:00.228
I love this dish.

32:00.332 --> 32:03.162
It's gotta get me
back up to the dorms.

32:03.266 --> 32:05.820
So tough.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.202
The person moving on is--

32:08.305 --> 32:17.245
[music playing]

32:17.349 --> 32:19.385
NARRATOR: Six chefs
are battling to stay

32:19.489 --> 32:22.975
alive in tonight's intensecook for your life challenge--

32:23.079 --> 32:25.667
Two good dishes, butthere's one that highlights

32:25.771 --> 32:27.255
a skill beyond belief.

32:27.359 --> 32:29.499
NARRATOR: --and Chef
Ramsay must decide

32:29.602 --> 32:31.501
who will survive
between Bret's seafood

32:31.604 --> 32:35.091
pasta or Roe's swordfish.

32:35.194 --> 32:39.888
The person moving on, basedon the complexity of the dish--

32:39.992 --> 32:43.651
congratulations, Bret.

32:43.754 --> 32:44.548
Well done.

32:44.652 --> 32:45.825
Thank you, Chef.

32:45.929 --> 32:46.965
Head to the door.

32:47.068 --> 32:48.069
Thanks so much, Chef.
I appreciate you, Chef.

32:48.173 --> 32:49.277
- Let them know--
- Y'all kill me.

32:49.381 --> 32:50.209
Y'all both better come back.

32:50.313 --> 32:51.348
--you are continuing.

32:51.452 --> 32:52.246
Fuck, yeah, Mama.

32:52.349 --> 32:53.764
That was for you, Mama.

32:53.868 --> 32:55.628
That's a fuck yeah, yo.

32:55.732 --> 32:57.803
I know my parents are
proud of me right now.

32:57.906 --> 32:58.804
Everything.

32:58.907 --> 33:00.840
Without them, I'd
probably be dead.

33:00.944 --> 33:01.980
That was for you, Mama.

33:02.083 --> 33:03.326
That's Bret.

33:04.396 --> 33:05.569
What happened?

33:05.673 --> 33:07.157
I'm back, ain't I?

33:07.261 --> 33:08.400
I see tears.
What happened?

33:08.503 --> 33:09.366
They're tears of joy, yo.

33:09.470 --> 33:10.850
What did you do?
What did you do?

33:10.954 --> 33:12.093
Fruitti di Mare, [inaudible].

33:12.197 --> 33:14.095
Clams, mussels, scallops,shrimp, [inaudible],,

33:14.199 --> 33:16.925
tomatoes cooked down,
scallops, wine, garlic.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.134
This this is what I did.

33:18.237 --> 33:19.031
That's what I did.

33:19.135 --> 33:21.413
My parents on a fucking plate.

33:21.516 --> 33:22.310
Hell, yeah, Mama.

33:22.414 --> 33:24.174
That one's for you, right there.

33:24.278 --> 33:25.072
[inaudible]

33:25.175 --> 33:27.246
You gonna make me cry.

33:27.350 --> 33:28.144
This shit is emotional.

33:28.247 --> 33:29.041
You know?

33:29.145 --> 33:30.456
With passion comes emotion.

33:30.560 --> 33:37.636
Mad fucking highs,
mad fucking lows.

33:37.739 --> 33:39.396
That one's for you, Mama.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.985
There's really no
in-betweens with me.

33:42.089 --> 33:43.642
Right.
Next up.

33:43.745 --> 33:44.574
Heather, let's go.

33:44.677 --> 33:45.747
Yes, Chef.

33:45.851 --> 33:49.717
Roe stepped her game up
a lot in this challenge.

33:49.820 --> 33:53.721
So she's setting that bar high,but that's OK because my bar

33:53.824 --> 33:55.033
is one peg higher.

33:55.136 --> 33:58.967
I did a coconut-currypoached lobster tail and claw.

33:59.071 --> 34:00.417
Yeah, I mean,visually, it's beautiful.

34:00.521 --> 34:01.694
It pops like a rainbow.

34:01.798 --> 34:03.903
I tried to go completely outof the comfort zone, Chef,

34:04.007 --> 34:07.459
because I'm not trying
to play too safe.

34:07.562 --> 34:08.356
It's very good.

34:08.460 --> 34:09.909
[inaudible]

34:10.013 --> 34:11.187
Thank you.

34:11.290 --> 34:13.154
The only thing that'sslightly obscure in that dish

34:13.258 --> 34:15.191
is those French beans
because they didn't fit.

34:15.294 --> 34:16.295
Step back in line, please.

34:16.399 --> 34:17.400
Thank you, Chef.

34:17.503 --> 34:20.575
This is really tough.

34:20.679 --> 34:27.479
The person moving on inthe competition is Heather.

34:27.582 --> 34:28.376
Thank you, Chef.

34:28.480 --> 34:29.308
Yes.

34:29.412 --> 34:30.965
Oh my god.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.174
I'm here to stay.

34:33.278 --> 34:35.038
This is probably the
biggest high I will

34:35.142 --> 34:36.177
ever have in my entire life.

34:36.281 --> 34:37.075
Yes.

34:37.178 --> 34:38.006
I did a fucking--

34:39.007 --> 34:40.008
[inaudible]

34:40.112 --> 34:42.459
Are you OK?

34:42.563 --> 34:43.357
Right.

34:43.460 --> 34:44.254
Next up.

34:46.532 --> 34:48.293
Gizzy, let's go, please.

34:48.396 --> 34:50.502
I'm looking at my dish andI'm looking at everybody else's.

34:50.605 --> 34:54.195
It feels like everybody's dishwent a little bit more elegant,

34:54.299 --> 34:56.646
and I went clean and rustic.

34:56.749 --> 34:58.026
Describe the dish, please.

34:58.130 --> 35:03.687
So lightly grilled stripedbass with a delicata squash.

35:03.791 --> 35:05.793
Why so rustic?

35:05.896 --> 35:07.657
Chef, this is the
way that I cook.

35:07.760 --> 35:09.037
This is the way that I eat.

35:09.141 --> 35:13.041
And I feel like this is thebest way to show you who I am.

35:13.145 --> 35:15.320
These ingredients did
not say rustic to me.

35:15.423 --> 35:16.735
I'm feeling pretty
confident right now

35:16.838 --> 35:18.150
that I have this in the bag.

35:18.254 --> 35:19.496
I'm going up to the dorms.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.497
Put on a pot of coffee.

35:20.601 --> 35:22.050
Let's do this.

35:22.154 --> 35:23.983
Are you expected
to eat the skin?

35:24.087 --> 35:24.950
Yeah.

35:25.053 --> 35:28.195
So why have you
left the scales on?

35:28.298 --> 35:29.092
Did you scale the fish?

35:29.196 --> 35:30.093
I did.

35:30.197 --> 35:32.544
Well, there's
scales left on there.

35:32.647 --> 35:35.063
I'm sorry about that, Chef.

35:35.167 --> 35:39.723
Well, it's you on a plate.

35:39.827 --> 35:42.968
And it's delicious.

35:43.071 --> 35:45.281
Get back in line, please.

35:45.384 --> 35:49.112
Good job, Giz.

35:49.216 --> 35:52.011
The person moving on
in the competition--

35:55.567 --> 35:56.913
Roe.
Congratulations.

35:57.016 --> 35:57.810
Thanks, Chef.

35:57.914 --> 35:58.708
Head upstairs

35:58.811 --> 36:00.227
Thank you, Chef.

36:00.330 --> 36:01.159
Yes.

36:01.262 --> 36:02.850
I knew I had a winner of a dish.

36:02.953 --> 36:03.989
Whew.

36:04.092 --> 36:06.129
I've been the quietest
asset at this time.

36:06.233 --> 36:07.682
Now Chef knows that I'm here.

36:07.786 --> 36:08.718
I showed up.

36:08.821 --> 36:10.168
I want to be his next chef.

36:10.271 --> 36:12.584
ALL: Yeah.

36:12.687 --> 36:14.068
Yeah, finally.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.691

36:20.626 --> 36:21.558
She'll be all right

36:21.662 --> 36:22.525
Wow

36:22.628 --> 36:24.596
Scotley's plate
looks like a mess.

36:24.699 --> 36:26.977
Gizzy, good dish.

36:27.081 --> 36:29.325
Let's see if it's betterthan the two remaining chefs.

36:29.428 --> 36:30.947
Next up, Jose.

36:31.050 --> 36:33.812
I definitely put my heartand soul into this dish today.

36:33.915 --> 36:35.434
I mean, I believe
that I'm safe tonight.

36:35.538 --> 36:38.437
Here, I have for you, Chef,is a pan-seared salmon,

36:38.541 --> 36:41.647
chorizo hash, and someavocado salsa verde, Chef.

36:41.751 --> 36:42.890
All right.

36:42.993 --> 36:44.167
Visually, it looks beautiful.- Thank you, Chef.

36:44.271 --> 36:45.375
I love those colors.
They pop.

36:45.479 --> 36:46.411
Thank you, Chef.

36:46.514 --> 36:47.929
Let's get into that
salmon, shall we?

36:48.033 --> 36:49.483
Yes, Chef.

36:49.586 --> 36:50.898
Skin, really crispy.

36:51.001 --> 36:51.830
Thank you, chef.

36:51.933 --> 36:52.727
Can you hear that?

36:52.831 --> 36:53.625
Yeah.

36:55.834 --> 36:56.697
Back in line.

36:56.800 --> 36:57.836
Yes, Chef.

36:57.939 --> 36:59.562
I know I knocked this
one out of the park.

36:59.665 --> 37:01.219
Only the strong survive.

37:01.322 --> 37:06.534
[inaudible] change,
a touch more acidity.

37:06.638 --> 37:08.709
Just needs that pop underneath.

37:08.812 --> 37:10.504
[inaudible] now beautifully,let me tell you.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.476
The person moving on is--

37:25.415 --> 37:27.762
NARRATOR: With only three chefsremaining in tonight's cook

between Jose and Gizzy

37:33.147 --> 37:35.494
to see who will be
the next to survive.

37:35.598 --> 37:48.369
The person moving on is Jose.

37:48.473 --> 37:49.715
Congratulations.

37:49.819 --> 37:51.165
Thank you, Chef.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.062
Wow.

37:52.166 --> 37:53.581
Amazing.
Great dish.

37:53.685 --> 37:54.479
Thank you, Chef.

37:54.582 --> 37:55.583
Appreciate it.

37:55.687 --> 37:57.620
Your best dish so far
in this competition.

37:57.723 --> 37:58.517
Thank you, Chef.

37:58.621 --> 37:59.484
It means a lot to me, Chef.

37:59.587 --> 38:00.623
Keep it going.

38:00.726 --> 38:02.176
It will mean even more to me.- I will, Chef.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.246
Thank you.
- Good job.

38:03.350 --> 38:05.421
I gave that dish
everything I had today.

38:05.524 --> 38:06.663
I mean, I couldn't
feel any better.

38:06.767 --> 38:09.183
I kind of just wished Icould have phoned my kids

38:09.287 --> 38:11.668
and told them, "Daddy
is here to stay."

38:11.772 --> 38:13.014
What's up, baby?

38:13.118 --> 38:14.119
That's what's up?

38:14.222 --> 38:16.086
That I have what
it takes to stay here

38:16.190 --> 38:18.365
and to continue to proveto him that I'm that chef

38:18.468 --> 38:19.711
that he's looking for.

38:19.814 --> 38:21.333
That's for your kids
right there, homey.

38:21.437 --> 38:22.230
Yes, it was.

38:26.062 --> 38:26.856
OK.

38:26.959 --> 38:29.617
Scotley, let's go.

38:29.721 --> 38:31.101
Thank you for being so patient.

38:31.205 --> 38:32.793
It's life or death right now.

38:32.896 --> 38:34.415
Life or death.

38:34.519 --> 38:35.865
I choose life.

38:35.968 --> 38:36.969
What do we have here?

38:37.073 --> 38:39.489
What I have here
is a dry-cured

38:39.593 --> 38:45.253
ahi tuna with some red lentilscooked down with some oregano.

38:45.357 --> 38:48.429
Why red lentils with ahi tuna?

38:48.533 --> 38:49.637
I just wanted
to bring something

38:49.741 --> 38:51.915
more earthy to
the freshness of--

38:52.019 --> 38:54.401
Earthy?

38:54.504 --> 38:57.611
Just, just 360 for me.

38:57.714 --> 39:00.890
360 for me, and have alook at the freshness here.

39:00.993 --> 39:03.030
Look at those
vegetables over there.

39:03.133 --> 39:04.618
Yes, Chef.

39:04.721 --> 39:07.655
And you give me dry lentils?

39:07.759 --> 39:08.587
Yes, Chef.

39:08.691 --> 39:09.726
Because if I
was in your shoes,

39:09.830 --> 39:12.211
I would not be put in
lentils under the best

39:12.315 --> 39:13.868
tuna in the world.

39:13.972 --> 39:15.180
Really?

39:15.283 --> 39:17.285
You didn't pick a fuckingvegetable from the fucking

39:17.389 --> 39:18.666
farmer's market?

39:18.770 --> 39:19.909
Really?

39:20.012 --> 39:22.049
The sear on the
tuna is beautiful.

39:22.152 --> 39:23.050
I love evenness of it.

39:28.504 --> 39:29.850
Step back in line, please.

39:29.953 --> 39:32.646
I could have donesomething totally different,

39:32.749 --> 39:34.302
but I went with what I wanted.

39:34.406 --> 39:37.375
And at this point, I got tostand by my dish everything

39:37.478 --> 39:38.548
on it.

39:38.652 --> 39:41.137
Listen, it's a great dish.

39:41.240 --> 39:45.900
Personally, would I servelentils under tuna tonight?

39:46.004 --> 39:47.557
No.

39:47.661 --> 39:52.079
Two good dishes, but here'sthe ironic twist this evening.

39:52.182 --> 39:55.013
Didn't you replace
Gizzy in her job?

39:55.116 --> 39:56.842
Yes, Chef.

39:56.946 --> 39:59.327
How ironic is this?

39:59.431 --> 40:01.985
Before I even got
into South City Kitchen,

40:02.089 --> 40:03.642
everybody "GIzzy this.

40:03.746 --> 40:04.643
Gizzy that.

40:04.747 --> 40:06.921
Gizzy is talented,
and she can cook.

40:07.025 --> 40:08.026
And all of that."

40:08.129 --> 40:11.063
I have a battle of
Atlanta on my hands.

40:11.167 --> 40:14.412
And I'm going to beat Gizzy totake the title of fucking ATL.

40:17.553 --> 40:19.486
This is really tough.

40:19.589 --> 40:20.452
The person moving on--

40:23.282 --> 40:29.634
congratulations goes to Scotley.

40:36.675 --> 40:37.987
Thank you, Chef.

40:38.090 --> 40:40.127
I'm still here.

40:40.230 --> 40:42.405
I'm in this bitch,
mother fucker.

40:42.509 --> 40:46.305
[interposing voices]

40:46.409 --> 40:47.272
[wolf howl]

40:47.375 --> 40:49.343
Fuck about, baby.

40:49.447 --> 40:52.070
My teeth is
fucking showing now.

40:52.173 --> 40:53.727
The wolf is here.

40:53.830 --> 40:55.936
[inaudible]

40:56.039 --> 40:57.558
Only the strong survive.

40:57.662 --> 41:01.562
Gizzy, you came in
like a firecracker.

41:01.666 --> 41:04.358
And then something happened.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.222
You lost your confidence.

41:06.325 --> 41:10.537
And when I see young chefslose their confidence,

41:10.640 --> 41:13.712
that tells me that they're notready to be my executive chef.

41:13.816 --> 41:15.369
And I appreciate your passion.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.266
Thank you, Chef.

41:16.370 --> 41:17.164
OK.

41:17.267 --> 41:19.200
Come on over here.

41:19.304 --> 41:20.270
Thank you for
pushing me harder

41:20.374 --> 41:21.271
than I've ever been pushed.

41:21.375 --> 41:23.239
I just wish you'd
continue climbing

41:23.342 --> 41:24.136
that ladder, young lady.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.206
Absolutely.

41:25.310 --> 41:27.243
Please, give me your jacket.

41:27.346 --> 41:28.140
Thank you.

41:28.244 --> 41:29.038
Thanks so much.

41:29.141 --> 41:31.109
Good night.

41:31.212 --> 41:34.561
The funny thing
is I was confident.

41:34.664 --> 41:36.252
I was confident
walking in these doors,

41:36.355 --> 41:38.979
and I don't know why I
let my own light dim.

41:39.082 --> 41:40.428
I commanded to take charge.

41:40.532 --> 41:42.983
I just don't know why I
couldn't show it here.

41:43.086 --> 41:44.294
I mean, I held my own self back.

41:44.398 --> 41:46.331
That's the end of the story.

41:49.230 --> 41:51.025
GORDON RAMSAY [VOICEOVER]: Ihad such high hopes for Gizzy

41:51.129 --> 41:54.650
from day one, but if she doesn'ttruly believe in herself,

41:54.753 --> 41:55.996
then I can't believe
in her, either.

42:01.380 --> 42:03.279
NARRATOR: Next time,

42:03.382 --> 42:05.764
