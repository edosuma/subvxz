Front and back, front and back.
Hi.

00:22.665 --> 00:25.640
Oh god! I'm so excited
you came.

00:25.684 --> 00:27.401
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

00:27.446 --> 00:29.828
Listen, I hope you brought
your dancing blownics

00:29.864 --> 00:32.045
because Tasha, Jamie and I

00:32.089 --> 00:33.981

with you.

00:34.016 --> 00:36.792
Our routine kills.
It kills!

00:38.128 --> 00:39.450
Do you wanna know
what it is?

00:39.868 --> 00:41.012
Not really.

00:42.505 --> 00:43.773
Oh, I see.

00:43.808 --> 00:45.423
You're trying to psych me out.

00:45.457 --> 00:48.221
Acting like you don't care.
I know you care.

00:48.548 --> 00:51.050
Listen, you tell me yours,
I'll tell you mine.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.770
These your outfits?

00:53.816 --> 00:55.031
Don't touch that.

00:56.036 --> 00:57.303
What? Is that,

00:57.346 --> 00:58.640
is that all you've got?

00:58.675 --> 01:02.121
Oh, yeah, yeah. First of many.
So many more to come.

01:02.166 --> 01:03.462
Oh, good,
'cause I was worried.

01:04.715 --> 01:06.942
- What do they look like?
- Why would you like to know?

01:07.366 --> 01:09.563
- Why are you so competitive?
- Me?!

01:09.608 --> 01:10.830
What about you?

01:10.877 --> 01:12.630
Alright, I've got to tell you
something. Come here.

01:12.676 --> 01:14.202
Come here. I have a secret.

01:14.878 --> 01:17.141
- What?
- I plan to

01:17.186 --> 01:19.253
sweep this thing, okay?

01:19.288 --> 01:22.391
Win all three competitions,
best dance, most money raised,

01:22.426 --> 01:24.821
- last couple standing.
- Last couple standing?

01:24.857 --> 01:26.332
- You know, for charity.
- Okay.

01:26.928 --> 01:27.903
You're good?

01:29.066 --> 01:30.483
- Don't tell anybody.
- No.

01:35.156 --> 01:36.530
Look at what you've done.

01:37.765 --> 01:38.961
I know, right?

01:42.578 --> 01:44.411
Aw, so cute. Okay.

01:44.457 --> 01:46.531
- Okay, what did I say?
- Bette?

01:46.567 --> 01:49.771
Hey! Oh god, I'm so sorry.
I kinda forgot to call you back.

01:49.816 --> 01:51.063
I just that I had a

01:51.098 --> 01:53.740
major collector on the
other line. I just got distracted.

01:53.786 --> 01:55.341
- I'm sorry.
- Is Tina here?

01:56.017 --> 01:58.173
She's on her way.
She just had a meeting.

01:58.207 --> 01:59.973
Can I, can I, can I...

02:01.056 --> 02:03.400
I would like to talk to you
privately, please.

02:04.606 --> 02:05.483
Sure.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.320
For me? Thanks.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.120
Did you tell her what happened?

02:12.156 --> 02:14.782
- When?
- After the opening.

02:14.818 --> 02:16.401
When she was out of town.

02:16.438 --> 02:18.381
Yeah, I told her all about it.

02:18.425 --> 02:20.040
You told her
about you and Kelly?

02:20.777 --> 02:23.670
How she came back to you house
and you had sex with her?

02:25.418 --> 02:26.941
What?

02:28.057 --> 02:30.790
It's not funny.
I saw you through the window.

02:31.535 --> 02:33.251
You weren't even trying
to hide it, Bette.

02:33.276 --> 02:35.542
Look, I don't know what you think
you saw, but I can tell you

02:35.575 --> 02:37.550
that however it appeared,
nothing happened.

02:37.607 --> 02:39.492
- Then what did I see, Bette?
- I don't know. You tell me.

02:39.527 --> 02:40.871
What did you see, Jenny?

02:42.878 --> 02:44.503
I know this is hard.

02:45.126 --> 02:47.202
And I know that you're trying
to be better,

02:47.236 --> 02:49.593
- and this isn't easy...
- Look, nothing happened.

02:49.627 --> 02:52.280
Kelly came over, she was drunk,
she spilled her drink,

02:52.327 --> 02:53.931
I cleaned it up,
that's the end of the story.

02:54.018 --> 02:56.001
- Let it go.
- Tina's my friend.

02:58.536 --> 03:01.641
You know how it works.
People find out about these things.

03:05.416 --> 03:06.380
How did it go?

03:06.418 --> 03:07.921
Good. Really good.

03:08.988 --> 03:10.983
- I'll tell you about it later.
- Okay. Great.

03:11.666 --> 03:13.601
I think we should get you
registered.

03:13.636 --> 03:14.702
- Come on.
- Okay.

03:15.265 --> 03:16.440

{\a6}ready

04:31.546 --> 04:33.222
{\a6}I think
when that's finished,

04:33.258 --> 04:34.363
{\a6}we should just
move in upstairs.

04:34.367 --> 04:36.293
{\a6}We can finally have
a little bit of privacy.

04:37.037 --> 04:38.722
{\a6}Bette,
he offered me a job.

04:38.765 --> 04:41.180
{\a6}- James Chamas?
- Head of production.

04:42.597 --> 04:44.903

That's fucking fantastic!

04:44.925 --> 04:47.740
{\a6}- Did you know that he'd...
- No, no, no, I had no idea.

04:47.776 --> 04:49.750
{\a6}We were in our meeting and

04:49.756 --> 04:52.893
{\a6}he starts asking me questions
about producer credits and,

04:52.896 --> 04:55.231
{\a6}I don't know! He just looks
at me all of a sudden and he says,

04:55.268 --> 04:57.233
{\a6}"Hey,
are you happy at Shaolin?" and

04:57.267 --> 04:59.022
{\a6}he knows everything
that's going on,

04:59.055 --> 05:00.750
{\a6}he's totally cool
about everything and,

05:01.297 --> 05:03.533
{\a6}bam! He just offers me
a job, right there.

05:03.577 --> 05:08.373
{\a6}Shut up! Oh my god!
You are such a fucking rock star!

05:09.845 --> 05:11.221
{\a6}It's in New York.

05:11.938 --> 05:13.263
{\a6}The job's in New York.

05:14.088 --> 05:15.772
{\a6}They want you
to move to New York?

05:15.808 --> 05:17.400
Who's moving to New York?

05:17.856 --> 05:19.202
Not you, guys.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.212
No one, no one.
We were just...

05:21.217 --> 05:23.362
- I got offered a job and...
- Right.

05:23.367 --> 05:24.841
I'm not gonna take it.

05:28.035 --> 05:30.043
- I'm not.
- We still have to talk about it.

05:30.046 --> 05:31.813
Yeah, you do
have to talk about it.

05:32.705 --> 05:35.032
Look, our life is here.
We live here, okay?

05:35.066 --> 05:37.220
- It's crazy. It's crazy.
- Your friends are here. Hello?

05:37.268 --> 05:38.211
God!

05:39.066 --> 05:40.863
And Bette, by the way
your work is here.

05:40.907 --> 05:43.070
You just set a really big
gallery opening.

05:43.105 --> 05:44.981
And we just rebuilt our house.

05:45.025 --> 05:47.523
Yeah, about that, you guys.
Can we talk?

05:47.565 --> 05:49.680
Are you really sure you wanna
have this girl moving with you?

05:50.086 --> 05:52.380
This girl is
our birthmother, okay?

05:52.417 --> 05:54.663
Her name is Marci, and
we're picking her up tomorrow,

05:54.706 --> 05:56.251
- at 7' in the morning.
- At 7' in the morning.

05:57.058 --> 05:58.811
That's why we can't stay
for the whole marathon.

05:58.875 --> 05:59.980
Are you sure about that?

06:00.846 --> 06:02.102
Why?
What are you trying to say?

06:02.147 --> 06:03.802
Have you not seen "Baby Mama"?

06:03.836 --> 06:05.631
Oh my god, it is so truthful,
it's like,

06:05.667 --> 06:08.031
you're all gonna start happy
and then before you know it

06:08.078 --> 06:09.731
you'll be waiting on her
hand and foot.

06:09.767 --> 06:12.162
You're gonna be scared
to have sex in your own house.

06:12.708 --> 06:15.592
And she's a teenager. She's gonna
hate you guys out of principle.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.163
You know what?
She's 22 years old.

06:17.206 --> 06:19.991
Okay, so she's gonna wanna
down like 50 beers after dinner

06:20.028 --> 06:21.283
and you can't stop her.

06:21.327 --> 06:23.140
- Or worse...
- What?

06:23.888 --> 06:26.122
One of you guys could end up
having an affair with her.

06:26.828 --> 06:28.512
Oh my god!

06:28.556 --> 06:30.373
You guys, you could get on

06:35.078 --> 06:37.262
- Okay, that's enough.
- I'm just saying

06:37.298 --> 06:39.703
- it's a possibility.
- No, it's not a possibility.

06:39.795 --> 06:40.611
I'm not some

06:40.645 --> 06:43.093

fucks everything that walks, okay?

06:43.135 --> 06:44.320
I can be trusted.

06:45.404 --> 06:46.931
I didn't say
it was gonna be you.

06:50.576 --> 06:51.778
Is Marci hot?

06:52.524 --> 06:54.325
- Oh, you guys, you are...

Give what you can.

07:28.545 --> 07:30.161
Look, I'm sorry

07:30.208 --> 07:32.063

07:34.178 --> 07:35.843
I feel like we,

07:35.888 --> 07:37.991
we pushed you into it.

07:40.836 --> 07:42.981
Thank you for apologizing,
but,

07:43.877 --> 07:46.160
I was complicit.
I wanted to know.

07:46.397 --> 07:47.570
<i>Great.</i>

07:52.268 --> 07:53.703
She's in love with you.

07:53.745 --> 07:56.243
<i>I'm gonna love you, ladies
and gentlemen. Let's do this.</i>

07:56.998 --> 07:58.101
Then where is she?

07:58.145 --> 08:00.063
Now it's my great pleasure

08:00.098 --> 08:02.091
to introduce you
to the director of

08:02.155 --> 08:04.541
Children,
Youth and Family Services

08:04.575 --> 08:06.800
at the Los Angeles
Gay and Lesbian Center,

08:07.597 --> 08:08.560
Miss Jamie Chen.

08:14.646 --> 08:17.142
- Wow, thank you guys so much.
- Here.

08:17.177 --> 08:18.961
- Thank you.
- Come on.

08:19.545 --> 08:21.623
There are thousands
of lesbian and gay

08:21.628 --> 08:23.961
and bisexual and transgender
young people

08:23.995 --> 08:26.121
living on the streets
of Los Angeles.

08:26.216 --> 08:28.170
But we're here for them
to get them off the streets,

08:28.217 --> 08:30.373
provide them food, shelter,
and counceling,

08:30.375 --> 08:32.381
and just let them know
that they're not alone.

08:32.456 --> 08:34.962
We are a family
and we stick together.

08:38.577 --> 08:41.030
Okay. I would like to introduce
you now to someone

08:41.087 --> 08:44.152
who's had a huge impact
in making this event possible,

08:44.188 --> 08:47.573
our honoring co-chair and
I'm really proud to say my friend,

08:47.615 --> 08:49.223
Alice Pieszecki.

08:56.808 --> 08:58.751
Thank you so much.
I am not gonna bore you

08:58.787 --> 09:01.122
with a really long story.
I will give you the overview.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.881
Some of you might know that

09:02.896 --> 09:06.070
I received a letter that I read
to millions of people on the air

09:06.105 --> 09:07.233
when I worked on "The Look",

09:07.276 --> 09:09.431
and since then
I have lost my job,

09:11.048 --> 09:12.922
I met a really good friend,

09:12.965 --> 09:15.032
I love my girlfriend
more than ever and

09:15.065 --> 09:17.483
I owe this all
to someone very special.

09:17.527 --> 09:19.631
There, I see you.
Marie, come here.

09:22.017 --> 09:23.983
- Say hi.
- Hi.

09:24.027 --> 09:27.803
Mary taught me something
very important and that's that

09:27.837 --> 09:29.322
it's not a one-way street.

09:29.578 --> 09:31.631
We can really
influence these kids, but

09:31.668 --> 09:33.850
if you give them two seconds
of your time,

09:33.896 --> 09:35.480
they can really turn
your life around.

09:35.515 --> 09:37.631
And so I just wanted to thank you
for coming into my life, Marie.

09:37.727 --> 09:38.652
Thank you.

09:42.527 --> 09:46.210
Okay, our goal tonight is
to raise 250,000 dollars

09:46.246 --> 09:47.803
for the
Jeff Griffith Youth Center.

09:47.848 --> 09:50.611
Yes. I know you're all here
to have fun and dance

09:50.657 --> 09:52.281
and that's great, but we also
wanna encourage you

09:52.318 --> 09:54.652
to be very generous.
So if you feel like pledging,

09:54.686 --> 09:56.713
please come up on the stage,
grap a microphone

09:56.746 --> 09:57.820
and pledge.

10:02.628 --> 10:04.743
<i>So who wants to set the tone?</i>

10:04.778 --> 10:06.353
We do.

10:06.385 --> 10:08.122
- We do?
- Yeah, we do.

10:10.096 --> 10:11.930
Bette and Tina,
my really good friends.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.110
They're amazing.

10:22.096 --> 10:23.650
How much are you gonna donate?

10:24.388 --> 10:26.720
We pledge 1,500 dollars.

10:26.765 --> 10:29.622
Wow! That's amazing!

10:31.548 --> 10:33.653
Is this... Isn't this easy?

10:33.695 --> 10:36.192
You just come so
you can pick a microphone,

10:36.235 --> 10:38.503

you can give,

10:38.536 --> 10:41.111
and just shut out a number.

10:43.555 --> 10:45.013
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:45.056 --> 10:47.101
I'd like to bring to the stage

10:47.135 --> 10:51.201

the incomparable

10:51.508 --> 10:53.030

11:00.478 --> 11:02.072
Oh my, my, my, look at you.

11:02.105 --> 11:03.980
Oh no, look at you yourself.

11:04.056 --> 11:06.331
- Now, I have a question for you.
- Ask, go on, sexy.

11:06.376 --> 11:09.812
Would you be my dance partner
for this evening?

11:09.828 --> 11:11.792
I don't even have to
think about it. That will be a

11:11.838 --> 11:12.850
"yes" and then

11:13.327 --> 11:15.063
"oh yes"!

11:15.485 --> 11:16.820
Are you sure?

11:16.866 --> 11:18.100
Oh, I'm sure.

11:26.077 --> 11:28.651
I'm really sorry about
what happened the other day.

11:32.565 --> 11:34.411
Don't listen to anything
she says, Helena.

11:34.457 --> 11:35.901
She's certifiable. Really.

11:36.505 --> 11:37.630
Where is your number?

11:38.597 --> 11:40.422
Hey, how come you all wear
the same one?

11:40.468 --> 11:41.863
I thought it was 2 per team.

11:41.908 --> 11:43.701
I know people who know people.

11:44.035 --> 11:45.460
Helena,
you should dance with me.

11:45.466 --> 11:47.323
Oh my god, you should.
You have to dance.

11:47.418 --> 11:49.503
- Come on, you should do it. It'll be fun.
- Do it!

11:51.288 --> 11:53.950
I don't want to disappoint you.
I'm not ready to step all night

11:54.026 --> 11:55.893
- and dance?
- It's twelve little hours.

11:55.925 --> 11:57.161
You can do that.

11:57.196 --> 11:59.473
I stayed up all week
building my endurance.

11:59.475 --> 12:01.773
I did. I mean,
Tasha stayed up with me.

12:01.818 --> 12:02.830
Alright. And

12:02.875 --> 12:04.441
where do I get
one of the number things?

12:04.476 --> 12:06.502
It's your club? You don't know
where to get a number?

12:06.597 --> 12:07.911
Come on. This way.
This way.

12:12.527 --> 12:13.921
That was nice of you.

12:13.966 --> 12:16.160
It's no big deal.
I'm happy to dance with her.

12:19.407 --> 12:20.462
What?

12:23.048 --> 12:25.171
If you don't know,
I'm not gonna tell you.

12:27.528 --> 12:29.883
Now, the next twelve hours
we will dance the music

12:29.928 --> 12:32.973
from the seventies, eighties,
nineties, and beyond.

12:33.065 --> 12:34.751
The longer
you stay on your feet,

12:34.798 --> 12:37.372
the more money you make
from your sponsors.

12:37.456 --> 12:39.771
So the simple objective,
ladies and gentlemen,

12:39.817 --> 12:41.731
stay on your feet.

12:41.808 --> 12:43.852
Because if you sit,
you're out.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.763
If you stand still
for too long...

12:46.066 --> 12:47.311
...you're out.

12:47.357 --> 12:48.880
Every three hours,

12:48.916 --> 12:51.950
we're gonna have ourselves
a little dance contest.

12:51.995 --> 12:53.413
All of you, beautiful contestors,

12:53.446 --> 12:55.073
will be taught a simple dance.

12:55.178 --> 12:56.473
It could be

12:57.655 --> 12:58.970
the hustle.

13:03.258 --> 13:04.711
The electric style.

13:07.418 --> 13:08.841
A salsa.

13:10.167 --> 13:11.422
A tango.

13:16.075 --> 13:19.472
Now, now, if there is
no spring in your step...

13:19.918 --> 13:21.832
...and no funk in your trunk,

13:21.878 --> 13:23.721
you will be...

13:23.756 --> 13:26.661
- ... eliminated.
- By one of our judges.

13:29.518 --> 13:31.580
Well, the question is,

13:31.617 --> 13:34.430
do you have
the staying power, huh?

13:34.467 --> 13:36.360
Like can't you believe.

I doubt it.

You know, when I first got here,
Jenny came up to me,

14:57.126 --> 14:59.453
and she started talking to me
about...

14:59.925 --> 15:03.070
- Remember I had the opening and...
- Guys, guys, guys, guys.

15:03.118 --> 15:05.812
I have kind of a
weird feeling about tonight.

15:06.666 --> 15:08.980
- About what?
- I'm not sure exactly.

15:09.026 --> 15:11.993
You know what, Alice? I was just
really in the middle of something.

15:12.028 --> 15:13.533
Is Jamie acting weird?

15:18.576 --> 15:19.870
Not that I can tell.

15:20.428 --> 15:22.781
- Alright.
- No, she seems fine.

15:24.448 --> 15:26.062
Okay, cool. Thanks.

15:28.096 --> 15:30.033
So anyway, I was saying, uh...

15:30.067 --> 15:33.132
- After the opening...
- Like not even like,

15:33.175 --> 15:36.733
a little, like a little vibe,
like no vibe over there?

15:36.766 --> 15:37.753
Nothing weird?

15:40.158 --> 15:42.423
- Not that I can tell.
- They're just dancing.

15:42.466 --> 15:44.633
- Yeah, totally. Of course.
- I think.

15:45.048 --> 15:46.430
Okay, dance. Dance.

15:50.545 --> 15:51.760
What if they are?

15:51.795 --> 15:53.422
That would so suck.

15:54.558 --> 15:55.503
What were you saying?

15:58.506 --> 16:00.503
Nevermind, it's nothing.

I can't, uh, I can't...
I don't have rythm.

- What?!
- I've never had rythm.

25:23.987 --> 25:25.440
Okay? I don't... This is

25:25.487 --> 25:26.930
- What do you...
- ... a joke.

25:26.968 --> 25:29.411
- And I was thinking.
- What are you talking about?

25:29.468 --> 25:31.932
You were the lead in
"West Side Story".

25:31.975 --> 25:34.290
Yeah, you said, "We're number one,
we can't be number two".

25:34.337 --> 25:36.370
You guys,
everyone went traditional.

25:36.407 --> 25:39.163

- No, we don't.

We look good. Okay,
we look a little crazy, but,

25:42.006 --> 25:43.701
alright, that's not the point.
Listen.

25:43.745 --> 25:45.402
Alright? We can do this.

25:45.448 --> 25:47.120
You know the routine,

25:47.166 --> 25:49.473
you choreographed everything,
okay?

25:49.966 --> 25:52.712
Another problem.
Why did you let me do that?

25:52.757 --> 25:54.853
I don't know
how to choreograph shit.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.581
- Put your wig on, okay?
- Come on.

25:56.618 --> 25:59.132
- You're gonna do this.
- I was a terrible Maria by the way.

25:59.168 --> 26:02.612
You're gonna do this, okay?
Just think of one thing. Think...

26:02.657 --> 26:04.351
Think... Okay, look.

26:04.398 --> 26:07.062
Everybody out there?

Any regrets?

Not a one.

32:16.628 --> 32:19.582
Jodi got three tens!

32:19.628 --> 32:21.890
No, I don't know
how you get three tens.

32:21.928 --> 32:23.612
- I've never seen anything like that.
- Did you know

32:23.646 --> 32:26.840
- she could dance like that?
- I had no idea.

32:26.885 --> 32:28.590
She must have practised
the routine for months.

32:28.637 --> 32:30.471
You had us practising for months.

32:31.045 --> 32:32.673
Your sense of fairplay is

32:32.715 --> 32:33.863
annoying.

32:34.586 --> 32:36.601
I'm just saying
don't be so a loser.

- Yeah, I know.

No, I'm not lying.

Whatever, but she looked
so hot tonight.

- Nikki, twelve o'clock.

I'm not here to reprimand you.

33:47.916 --> 33:48.821
I know.

33:49.427 --> 33:52.483
So, you know
that this is a fundraiser.

33:52.525 --> 33:55.322
Obviously. Why would I wanna
be here 'til this hour?

33:55.356 --> 33:57.013
Right, exactly. So,

33:57.057 --> 33:58.733
I was down there
and I was thinking

33:58.757 --> 34:01.140
that the public is
very harsh with you.

34:01.187 --> 34:03.372
And that you have
a reputation

34:03.418 --> 34:05.112
for being shallow

34:05.156 --> 34:06.370
and vain.

34:06.417 --> 34:07.640
No, I don't.

34:07.678 --> 34:08.831
You do.

34:09.318 --> 34:11.170
And I was thinking that

34:11.206 --> 34:13.313
it would be really cool

34:13.344 --> 34:15.570
and great for your image

34:15.608 --> 34:17.531
and great for the cause
if you were

34:17.617 --> 34:19.523
to auction off a date
with yourself.

34:20.995 --> 34:22.621
- A date with me?
- Yeah.

34:23.877 --> 34:26.360
You would raise a ton of money
for the shelter,

34:26.408 --> 34:27.960
you would stand up
on the stage,

34:27.976 --> 34:29.690
you would start a bidding war.

34:29.726 --> 34:31.953
People would think
you are super cool.

34:31.996 --> 34:34.621
So much better
than just donating money.

34:35.786 --> 34:36.920
What do you think?

34:39.536 --> 34:40.820
I'll think about it.

34:41.976 --> 34:42.812
Thank you.

34:49.916 --> 34:50.880
What did she want?

34:51.514 --> 34:52.701
Are you okay?

34:59.178 --> 35:00.102
What?

35:02.816 --> 35:03.962
This just...

35:04.937 --> 35:07.162
This reminds me of
when I was about

35:07.197 --> 35:09.713
14 and I would

35:10.348 --> 35:12.330
sneak out of boarding school

35:12.378 --> 35:16.783
so I could snog with
Bridget Crossings. Oh god!

35:19.907 --> 35:21.702
Whatever happened to Bridget?

35:23.237 --> 35:24.530
Oh she

35:24.575 --> 35:28.611
hooked up with Jonathan Barcley,
this maths genius and

35:28.648 --> 35:31.730
It kind of
broke my heart actually.

35:34.957 --> 35:36.713
Doesn't really seem
that much has changed,

35:36.745 --> 35:39.603
does that just seem
I can't believe in my heart.

35:46.278 --> 35:48.233
Dylan, I'm sorry, okay?

35:48.278 --> 35:50.110
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, no.

35:50.847 --> 35:51.932
Listen.

35:56.345 --> 35:58.370
No, no more apologies.

36:00.157 --> 36:01.302
I think,

36:02.117 --> 36:04.912
I think that we need
to just start new.

36:07.355 --> 36:08.762
Can we do that?

36:11.587 --> 36:13.693
Alright. Yeah.

to auction off

36:44.648 --> 36:48.162
a date with myself
to the highest bidder.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.043
- Would you help me out?
- That'd be lovely.

36:52.085 --> 36:55.361
Oh, get ourselves ???
the 500 dollars.

36:55.406 --> 36:57.303
- Yeah, 500 dollars right here.
- Come on, guys!

36:57.345 --> 36:59.022

Do we have 600 dollars?

37:01.258 --> 37:02.793

Let's go over the 1,000.

37:02.836 --> 37:04.981
1,000! Oh, you know...

37:05.026 --> 37:06.840
Let make this really interesting

37:06.887 --> 37:09.062
and just go for 2,000 dollars.

37:09.097 --> 37:11.063
I make really good pancakes.

37:11.108 --> 37:13.483
Well, that sounds
what waking up for.

37:13.556 --> 37:15.420
They're not gonna get to 2,000.

37:15.497 --> 37:17.463
- This guy over here.
- 2,000?

37:17.495 --> 37:19.251
25,000 dollars.

37:19.786 --> 37:22.661
Could you repeat that again,
please?

37:22.697 --> 37:24.653

37:26.146 --> 37:28.570
25,000 dollars...

37:28.617 --> 37:30.880
Would you please
make your way up on stage?

37:31.677 --> 37:33.900
Unless someone
is willing to outbid.

37:33.997 --> 37:35.562
Motherfucker!

37:35.597 --> 37:39.563
I do believe we have the largest
single donation of this event.

37:40.396 --> 37:43.581
That's the second...
That's the second thing I lost.

37:43.627 --> 37:44.872
Let's give it up,

37:44.875 --> 37:46.471
- ladies and gentlemen.
- Can I just say something?

37:48.007 --> 37:50.010
You don't have to fuck her
in the bathroom anymore.

37:50.046 --> 37:51.823
You don't have to sneack around.

37:51.857 --> 37:53.473
I don't want you to do that.

37:53.477 --> 37:55.832
So I bought her for you.
So you can have her

37:55.866 --> 37:57.152

40:28.745 --> 40:30.833
Really? I'm gonna just...

40:55.835 --> 40:58.651
I was crazy to think
that a fifteen minutes nap

40:58.685 --> 41:00.022
would help.

41:01.765 --> 41:03.771
I have to ask you a question.

41:04.506 --> 41:05.883
What's up?

41:07.508 --> 41:10.511
Do you have feelings for Tasha?

41:17.145 --> 41:18.381
Oh god!

41:29.967 --> 41:32.001
I would never do anything...

41:37.975 --> 41:39.053
I know.

42:17.686 --> 42:19.883
Do we tell Marci about New York?

42:23.366 --> 42:25.370
You're really serious
about this?

42:25.405 --> 42:27.361
It just feels
really right to me.

You know, I don't know
when another opportunity like this

42:29.815 --> 42:31.101
might come along.

42:31.697 --> 42:33.332
What about the gallery?

42:34.806 --> 42:36.420
I can work from New York.

42:36.467 --> 42:38.610
I'll probably have to be there
half of the time anyway.

42:39.765 --> 42:41.041
And our friends?

42:47.598 --> 42:48.840
I love our friends.

42:49.475 --> 42:51.692
I love them a lot,
but, you know,

42:53.558 --> 42:56.313
at a certain point
I have to trust

42:56.346 --> 42:57.881
they're like a family.

42:58.907 --> 43:00.701
You know? And just because

43:01.268 --> 43:02.690
we leave L.A.,

43:02.735 --> 43:04.981
doesn't mean
that we're leaving them.

43:11.747 --> 43:13.642
It's really
gonna become healthy.

43:14.087 --> 43:15.882
It will be a fresh start.

43:15.925 --> 43:17.100
It's a new city.

43:17.146 --> 43:19.332
It's gonna be so exciting.

43:21.056 --> 43:22.331
Oh my god!

43:23.065 --> 43:25.063
We have to apply for schools.

43:26.385 --> 43:28.161
- Like right now.
- I know.

43:29.105 --> 43:30.192
- "Distant Dreamer" by Duffy -

43:30.245 --> 43:32.183
Who the hell is the guy
with the microphone?

43:32.196 --> 43:34.761
Oh my god, just hang on
a second. Wait, wait, you...

43:35.697 --> 43:38.440
You just can't come up
on the stage.

43:40.097 --> 43:43.130
You were
at my sister's gallery.

43:43.666 --> 43:44.832
I was.

43:46.946 --> 43:49.212
Most of you know me as

43:49.248 --> 43:51.053
Sunset Boulevard.

43:53.125 --> 43:54.742
But my real name

43:55.668 --> 43:56.960
is Sonny Benson

43:57.926 --> 43:59.923
and I'm a straight man

43:59.965 --> 44:02.653
who loves
this gay-lesbian family.

44:06.105 --> 44:08.741
And I hope that
you could still accept me.

44:12.486 --> 44:14.102
You lied to me.

44:16.105 --> 44:18.153
- I tried to tell you.
- You lied to me.

44:18.197 --> 44:20.460
- I never lied to you.
- You are a con man.

44:20.508 --> 44:22.853
I never lied to you, girlfriend.
You assumed...

44:22.885 --> 44:24.603
I trusted you!

44:24.638 --> 44:28.092
I trusted... I told you things
that I would never tell a man!

44:28.147 --> 44:29.570
What did you think I was?

44:29.646 --> 44:32.182
The dress didn't change the fact
that I was a man!

44:32.705 --> 44:34.501
You trusted me because

44:34.535 --> 44:37.160
you felt I could be trusted.

44:39.078 --> 44:42.723
Give me a chance. I know
I have you at a disadvantage.

44:43.396 --> 44:46.291
And I know I know more of
your stories than you know mine, but

44:46.327 --> 44:48.510
I'd love a chance to fix that.

44:53.666 --> 44:56.060
You're one of the most
beautiful women I've ever seen.

44:58.526 --> 45:00.513
And I'd love nothing better
than to

45:00.976 --> 45:02.581
take you to dinner,

45:02.617 --> 45:04.432
and to know you better.

45:06.775 --> 45:08.810
It's, uh... I don't know.

46:16.036 --> 46:18.100
Maybe she fell asleep
on the bus.

47:42.916 --> 47:44.780
I want you to know

47:45.957 --> 47:47.720
that I've never loved you more.

47:52.385 --> 47:54.490
And I want you to be happy.

47:59.756 --> 48:02.210
Do you wanna be with Jamie?

48:16.757 --> 48:18.080
I don't...

48:22.087 --> 48:23.983
- I don't know if...
- It's okay.

48:27.807 --> 48:29.563
I'm not ready to let you go.

48:44.505 --> 48:46.662
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

48:46.695 --> 48:50.823
<i>we have
our last couple standing.</i>
