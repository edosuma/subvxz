01:24.049 --> 01:26.924
Elevator arrived.

01:54.079 --> 01:55.425
Fuck you!

02:00.465 --> 02:02.132
Elevator arrived.

02:08.542 --> 02:10.475
Where is it?

02:31.944 --> 02:33.508
Come on!

02:44.060 --> 02:45.451
Come on!

02:45.475 --> 02:46.304
Come on!

03:10.673 --> 03:12.237
UCT monitor

03:12.261 --> 03:14.998
will self-destruct
in 10 minutes.

03:30.624 --> 03:34.524
UCT monitor will
self-destruct in nine minutes.

03:35.594 --> 03:36.837
Murphy, here.

03:37.907 --> 03:39.080
Cargo secured.

03:40.323 --> 03:41.921
Copy that, Murphy.

03:41.945 --> 03:46.340
They initiated self-destruct
in four minutes.

03:46.364 --> 03:48.169
You guys think you could get

03:48.193 --> 03:50.620
your fucking act together real
quick and get me out of here?

03:50.644 --> 03:52.104
We got your back, Murph.

03:52.128 --> 03:54.210
Stay frosty in there.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.281
We'll see you soon.

03:56.305 --> 03:57.892
Thank you, Murph.

03:59.618 --> 04:02.010
So that's the way it's gonna be.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.495
Correct.

04:11.803 --> 04:13.332
Yeah.

04:13.356 --> 04:15.255
I figured it would be you.

04:17.498 --> 04:18.430
How about you

04:20.466 --> 04:22.331
take good care of my kids, okay?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.850
I deserve that much.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.106
UCT monitor will self-destruct

04:29.130 --> 04:30.591
in eight minutes.

04:35.482 --> 04:37.943
Welcome to Sector Nine.

04:37.967 --> 04:39.462
Blue Collar Wing.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.087
Have a nice day.

04:44.111 --> 04:44.939
Woo!

04:45.871 --> 04:46.676
Call the team!

04:46.700 --> 04:47.987
I'm ready to work!

04:48.011 --> 04:49.195
Fighting fuck!

04:49.219 --> 04:51.681
I'm fucking ready, woo!

04:51.705 --> 04:52.854
Hello, boys.

04:52.878 --> 04:54.304
What's up?

04:54.328 --> 04:56.064
There's some blood and
some germs for the gentlemen.

04:56.088 --> 04:56.996
How're you guys
doing tonight, good?

04:57.020 --> 04:58.964
We're doing great, Amy.

04:58.988 --> 05:00.172
It's Amy, ain't it?

05:00.196 --> 05:01.863
It's Ashley.

05:01.887 --> 05:04.418
That ass looks like an
Amy, so I'm calling you Amy.

05:04.442 --> 05:06.834
Yeah, I like Amy.

05:06.858 --> 05:07.766
Yeah, right?

05:07.790 --> 05:09.561
I got a question for you?

05:09.585 --> 05:11.138
What can I get for you?

05:12.346 --> 05:13.841
What do you think
you can get for me?

05:13.865 --> 05:15.360
Yeah, tell her, Chulo.

05:15.384 --> 05:16.799
I want that neck.

05:18.076 --> 05:20.123
And when I'm done
with that neck,

05:20.147 --> 05:22.470
I wonder what time those
legs open or business.

05:22.494 --> 05:23.402
Yeah, what time?

05:23.426 --> 05:24.748
Fuck all night long.

05:24.772 --> 05:26.440
Actually, they're
closed for the holidays.

05:26.464 --> 05:27.717
Yeah right,

05:27.741 --> 05:30.754
you could be paying me
at the end of the night.

05:30.778 --> 05:32.584
Come on, mamacita.

05:32.608 --> 05:33.447
You're just turning me on.

05:33.471 --> 05:34.724
Fire it up!

05:34.748 --> 05:35.863
We'll have a good time.

05:35.887 --> 05:37.727
Keep fighting,
you're turning me on.

05:37.751 --> 05:38.579
Hey!

05:40.098 --> 05:41.524
Leave the girl alone,

05:41.548 --> 05:43.826
finish your drink
and get the hell out.

05:50.902 --> 05:53.214
I took shrapnel in the
ass during the war.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.389
Little pissants like you,

05:56.425 --> 05:58.126
you ain't never done shit.

05:58.150 --> 06:00.290
You ain't never worked
for a goddamn thing.

06:01.430 --> 06:02.603
Now get the fuck out!

06:03.432 --> 06:04.995
Whatever.

06:05.019 --> 06:06.583
You're a bitch.

06:06.607 --> 06:09.828
Gentlemen, I believe
you were asked to leave.

06:09.852 --> 06:11.726
You're headed the wrong way.

06:11.750 --> 06:12.579
Door's that way.

06:13.718 --> 06:16.248
Who are you, the busboy?

06:16.272 --> 06:17.722
Fist time here, guys?

06:18.999 --> 06:19.827
You know,

06:21.450 --> 06:24.636
I'm gonna go back to filling
up the salt shakers real quick,

06:24.660 --> 06:26.869
but first, you guys
need to learn the rules.

06:28.733 --> 06:29.813
Yeah, fucking right!

06:29.837 --> 06:30.666
Woo!

06:31.529 --> 06:32.713
That's strike one.

06:32.737 --> 06:35.267
Hit him again harder this time.

06:35.291 --> 06:36.119
Woo!

06:37.362 --> 06:38.328
That's two, yeah.

06:42.540 --> 06:44.587
You see that sign over
there on the wall?

06:44.611 --> 06:45.439
Yeah.

06:46.613 --> 06:48.349
I think this is a
good time to tell you,

06:48.373 --> 06:49.488
it's my sign.

06:49.512 --> 06:50.696
You're the boss, huh?

06:50.720 --> 06:52.008
I am, indeed.

06:53.309 --> 06:57.900
<i>♪ This time I have
made enough mistakes ♪</i>

07:08.669 --> 07:09.877
Fucking dead, old man.

07:12.052 --> 07:13.191
Ow, that hurt.

07:15.469 --> 07:16.722
How're you doing, Ryker?

07:16.746 --> 07:18.344
Call me Boss.

07:18.368 --> 07:19.967
It's not wartime anymore.

07:19.991 --> 07:20.819
It is here.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.270
Thank you.

07:25.928 --> 07:27.492
You okay, honey?

07:27.516 --> 07:29.114
I'm fine.

07:29.138 --> 07:30.702
Don't worry.

07:30.726 --> 07:32.117
Take the rest of
the night off, okay?

07:32.141 --> 07:32.945
I'll cover for you.

07:32.969 --> 07:35.569
Okay, thanks.

07:35.593 --> 07:36.456
Aw.

07:37.836 --> 07:39.711
Still extending the helping
hand to the unfortunate.

07:39.735 --> 07:41.253
How lovely of you, Adam.

07:42.945 --> 07:44.301
Some things never change.

07:44.325 --> 07:45.154
She's young.

07:46.086 --> 07:47.018
There's no family.

07:48.329 --> 07:49.134
It hasn't been that long.

07:49.158 --> 07:51.343
It's been 15 years.

07:55.923 --> 07:57.763
Why are you here, Weathers?

07:57.787 --> 07:59.385
I've got a job offer.

07:59.409 --> 08:00.663
No thanks, I've got a job.

08:00.687 --> 08:02.999
And your job sucks.

08:04.760 --> 08:05.830
No offense.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.592
And I hear you're
behind on your payments.

08:10.973 --> 08:11.801
Oh yeah?

08:12.802 --> 08:14.055
Where'd you hear that?

08:14.079 --> 08:16.299
The President of
the Unites States.

08:16.323 --> 08:18.957
President Henricksen,
ring a bell?

08:18.981 --> 08:21.397
Back in America, on
the planet Earth.

08:22.640 --> 08:23.617
Spins around, spins around.

08:23.641 --> 08:25.135
It's got one moon.

08:25.159 --> 08:26.620
Mercury, Venus,

08:26.644 --> 08:28.414
the one we fucked up
with the nuclear weapons.

08:28.438 --> 08:30.762
Were you unconscious
on your way up here, man?

08:30.786 --> 08:32.166
I don't live there anymore.

08:33.582 --> 08:34.799
Want a drink or something

08:34.823 --> 08:35.801
because I got a
lot of shit to do.

08:35.825 --> 08:37.700
I need two minutes, Adam.

08:37.724 --> 08:38.587
Hear me out.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.118
You were always
needy as fuck, man.

08:42.142 --> 08:43.808
You got two minutes.

08:43.832 --> 08:45.052
You look good too.

08:45.076 --> 08:46.329
New fall fashion, what
do you got on there?

08:46.353 --> 08:47.813
Two minute, asshole.

08:47.837 --> 08:48.849
Ron, I need a few.

08:48.873 --> 08:49.770
I got you.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.091
Last time I saw you, you
were sweet on Henricksen.

09:01.230 --> 09:02.483
You were still running
around the country

09:02.507 --> 09:04.899
soaking up all that
"war hero" bullshit.

09:04.923 --> 09:07.132
Yeah, well, I settled down.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.652
I got a wife and kid.

09:12.137 --> 09:13.104
Lost both.

09:15.969 --> 09:18.799
Came up here when they
started the settlement.

09:19.662 --> 09:21.157
Henricksen's president now?

09:21.181 --> 09:22.399
She is.

09:22.423 --> 09:23.608
Pretty good one too.

09:23.632 --> 09:25.126
You don't keep up
on much, do you?

09:25.150 --> 09:26.566
Not by choice.

09:28.982 --> 09:31.132
All right, Weathers, I'll bite.

09:31.156 --> 09:32.720
What's the job?

09:32.744 --> 09:36.310
Spacecraft UCT monitor
carrying an alien life form

09:36.334 --> 09:37.991
was commandeered by mercenaries.

09:39.233 --> 09:41.729
We need you to
bring it back, Adam.

09:41.753 --> 09:43.489
Who are the mercs?

09:43.513 --> 09:47.045
It was Murphy and
another team unknown.

09:47.069 --> 09:48.553
Okay, so where's Murph now?

09:49.485 --> 09:50.659
They killed him, Adam.

09:52.488 --> 09:54.259
The unknown team.

09:54.283 --> 09:56.848
And they made off
with the life form.

09:56.872 --> 09:57.700
Fuck me.

10:03.016 --> 10:04.407
Who hired the mercs?

10:04.431 --> 10:05.857
Omni Tech Universal.

10:05.881 --> 10:07.444
Omni Tech Universal shut
down, they're out of business.

10:07.468 --> 10:08.953
That's what we thought too.

10:10.368 --> 10:12.449
Intelligence tells us
that they have a satellite

10:12.473 --> 10:14.659
hovering around the earth,
right now, as we speak.

10:14.683 --> 10:16.626
We believe they're going
to use it as a platform

10:16.650 --> 10:18.801
to launch chemical weapons
against the United States.

10:18.825 --> 10:21.666
This is a matter of
national security, Adam.

10:21.690 --> 10:25.739
We need you to pick a team of
five men and bring it back.

10:25.763 --> 10:27.326
Why just five?

10:27.350 --> 10:29.605
This is a snatch
and grab, solider.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.630
Not a firefight.

10:37.844 --> 10:39.017
What's the pay?

10:40.778 --> 10:42.341
10 million credits
to be disbursed,

10:42.365 --> 10:44.516
as you wish, amongst your team.

10:44.540 --> 10:46.035
Yeah,

10:46.059 --> 10:47.508
that definitely takes care
of a few things around here.

10:48.889 --> 10:50.142
I'm in.

10:50.166 --> 10:52.006
Knew that you would.

10:52.030 --> 10:53.352
Here's my briefing.

10:53.376 --> 10:55.009
All the information you need.

10:55.033 --> 10:56.390
Thank you.

10:56.414 --> 10:57.208
No.

10:58.416 --> 10:59.313
Thank you, Adam.

11:02.247 --> 11:03.283
Don't think me yet.

11:04.525 --> 11:05.364
I'll take that drink now.

11:05.388 --> 11:06.918
I bet you will.

11:06.942 --> 11:07.770
It's on you.

11:09.772 --> 11:11.716
Always is.

11:33.796 --> 11:35.740
The mission has been accepted.

11:35.764 --> 11:36.602
Who took it?

11:36.626 --> 11:38.259
Our old pal, Ryker.

11:38.283 --> 11:39.112
Ryker.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.022
He still putting
on the stoic act?

11:42.046 --> 11:42.850
Indeed.

11:42.874 --> 11:44.541
Doesn't make me happy.

11:44.565 --> 11:45.784
This guy's got a rep.

11:45.808 --> 11:47.544
He's a decorated war hero

11:47.568 --> 11:49.650
and the prime reason
we're alive today

11:49.674 --> 11:51.169
and walking these halls.

11:51.193 --> 11:53.999
I know his record and I
know you served with him

11:54.023 --> 11:56.761
but this "war hero" is
now a citizen of the moon.

11:56.785 --> 11:58.521
That makes him a
deserter in my eyes.

11:58.545 --> 12:00.765
This isn't about nationalism.

12:00.789 --> 12:02.180
We need someone
who can do the job

12:02.204 --> 12:04.561
and Ryker is the best candidate.

12:04.585 --> 12:06.425
Best candidate, maybe,

12:06.449 --> 12:08.082
but that doesn't mean
he's upping our chances

12:08.106 --> 12:08.911
of pulling this off.

12:08.935 --> 12:09.877
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:09.901 --> 12:11.430
What do you mean?

12:11.454 --> 12:12.949
This isn't the same Omni
Tech that cloned game hens

12:12.973 --> 12:15.365
to feed the homeless
back in the 2020s.

12:15.389 --> 12:17.540
They're biological
revolutionaries.

12:17.564 --> 12:18.748
They're dangerous.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.854
If they're doing what
my intel suggests,

12:20.878 --> 12:23.373
should Ryker and his
team not pull this off,

12:23.397 --> 12:24.650
it could be bad.

12:24.674 --> 12:26.066
Bad?

12:26.090 --> 12:27.550
Why?

12:27.574 --> 12:30.726
I think that Miller's
concern lies with the cargo.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.074
It was taken from
the Sharak System.

12:34.098 --> 12:35.903
They're pirates at best.

12:35.927 --> 12:37.491
Interstellar revolutionaries.

12:37.515 --> 12:38.734
Thieves.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.909
But nevertheless, they
are quite dangerous.

12:41.933 --> 12:44.601
Then what are you
assuming, Miller?

12:44.625 --> 12:47.673
If you don't mind,
I'm kinda on a roll now.

12:47.697 --> 12:49.503
What Miller is suggesting

12:49.527 --> 12:51.954
is that if Ryker is
unsuccessful and that cargo

12:51.978 --> 12:54.359
does not end up in the
hands on the Sharak team,

12:55.533 --> 12:57.235
then most assuredly,

12:57.259 --> 12:59.917
World War Four will not
be instigated by mankind.

13:03.921 --> 13:05.001
Yeah.

13:05.025 --> 13:06.969
That's what I'm saying.

13:06.993 --> 13:09.202
Then Ryker has no
choice but to succeed.

13:11.342 --> 13:15.667
Set aside a bonus of
another 10 million credits.

13:15.691 --> 13:18.049
Don't let him know
until it's deposited.

13:18.073 --> 13:19.671
If he doesn't succeed,

13:19.695 --> 13:21.801
turn those credits
back into the military.

13:22.663 --> 13:23.526
You're dismissed.

17:28.392 --> 17:29.748

18:58.378 --> 19:01.381
Have a wonderful
evening, Ryker, Adam J.

19:38.901 --> 19:41.121
Ah, you're getting slow
in your old age, Stephenson.

19:41.145 --> 19:42.950
So is you, man,
don't you forget it.

19:42.974 --> 19:45.194
Okay, I got friends like
you keep reminding me.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.092
You haven't been down
to Earth in awhile, have you?

19:47.116 --> 19:48.508
No, I haven't.

19:48.532 --> 19:49.785
After we wrap this up, man,

19:49.809 --> 19:50.613
you should come back and visit.

19:50.637 --> 19:51.718
You should stay awhile.

19:51.742 --> 19:52.650
I can't, man, I can't.

19:52.674 --> 19:54.376
I've got the bar to look after.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.136
Settlers like to roughhouse.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.275
It's a mess.

19:57.299 --> 19:58.345
That's an unfortunate.

19:58.369 --> 19:59.277
It is, it is.

19:59.301 --> 20:00.036
How're the girls doing, man?

20:00.060 --> 20:01.521
How's Abby?

20:01.545 --> 20:02.936
Girls are doing good and
Abby about to go to college.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.179
Oh, come on.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.352
Trust me.
Kidding me?

20:05.376 --> 20:07.136
Grew up right in front
of my eyes, brother.

20:08.137 --> 20:09.253
That's hurtful.

20:09.277 --> 20:10.081
Yeah.

20:10.105 --> 20:11.013
Seriously.

20:11.037 --> 20:12.359
She don't any boyfriends yet.

20:12.383 --> 20:13.774
I hope not, man.

20:13.798 --> 20:15.431
I ain't old enough to be
handling the whole shotgun hand

20:15.455 --> 20:17.261
when some punk kid come
take my girl on a date.

20:17.285 --> 20:18.745
You're right and I tell
you, when that time comes,

20:18.769 --> 20:19.987
you let me know, I'll
send the porch with you.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.368
Hey man, I'm gonna
hold you to that.

20:21.392 --> 20:22.231
Please do.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.232
Seriously.

20:23.256 --> 20:24.164
Hey, it's good to see you, man.

20:25.085 --> 20:25.890
Roughneck.

20:25.914 --> 20:27.132
I missed you.

20:27.156 --> 20:27.823
Man, it's been
too long, brother.

20:27.847 --> 20:28.789
Too long.

20:28.813 --> 20:30.170
Too damn long.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.601
D!

20:47.625 --> 20:49.948
You son of a bitch!

20:49.972 --> 20:51.502
Where you been at, man?

20:51.526 --> 20:53.849
You still living up in that
strip club attic in Jersey?

20:53.873 --> 20:56.403
No, man, I got me a fine
piece of cybernetic ass

20:56.427 --> 20:57.335
up on the Kennedy Station.

20:57.359 --> 20:59.510
Holy shit.

20:59.534 --> 21:00.649
Is she the one?

21:00.673 --> 21:02.271
She's one of the ones.

21:02.295 --> 21:03.203
One of the girls in the club.

21:03.227 --> 21:04.894
I got me a fucking woman.

21:04.918 --> 21:05.826
Okay!

21:05.850 --> 21:07.138
That's enough, thank you.

21:07.162 --> 21:08.657
Mount up!

21:12.961 --> 21:13.765

21:13.789 --> 21:14.618

21:16.205 --> 21:17.034

21:32.325 --> 21:33.233
Noob.

21:33.257 --> 21:35.580
Hey, didn't you ever play Halo?

21:35.604 --> 21:36.823
What's that?

21:36.847 --> 21:38.583
That's you being a fucking noob.

21:39.884 --> 21:41.966
He is a noob, big time.

21:41.990 --> 21:43.830
Where's you find
the infant, boss?

21:43.854 --> 21:45.176
Bartender recommended him.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.522
Ron?

21:46.546 --> 21:48.248
Jesus Christ, I
hope he's stronger

21:48.272 --> 21:49.698
than Ron's old Bloody Marys.

21:51.033 --> 21:52.321
Yeah, like you handled them.

21:52.345 --> 21:53.805
All right, baby,

21:57.626 --> 21:58.810

Yes she did.

22:10.259 --> 22:11.789

22:23.859 --> 22:24.767

22:24.791 --> 22:26.010
That's what I like to hear.

22:26.034 --> 22:28.012
Talk to dirty to me, baby.

22:28.036 --> 22:30.186
So what's with the DNA coding?

22:30.210 --> 22:32.016
It's not coding.

22:32.040 --> 22:35.053
It's a highly committed,
physically explicit relationship.

22:35.077 --> 22:35.985
Give it a feel.

22:36.009 --> 22:37.401
Leave the kid alone, D.

22:37.425 --> 22:39.541
If you want, D can
give you some DNA coding.

22:39.565 --> 22:40.393
Look, Noob,

22:41.498 --> 22:43.165
just don't use
someone else's weapon.

22:43.189 --> 22:44.408
That's all you need to know.

22:44.432 --> 22:45.340
Okay.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.583
I said it's a physical.

22:47.607 --> 22:48.722
Okay!

22:48.746 --> 22:49.620
Thank you.

22:49.644 --> 22:50.507
Focus up!

22:52.992 --> 22:54.245
Gentlemen,

22:54.269 --> 22:56.281
this is a simple snatch...

22:58.377 --> 23:00.009
Sorry, boss.

23:00.033 --> 23:00.793
Sorry.

23:02.208 --> 23:04.428
I thought you at least
got out of the third grade.

23:04.452 --> 23:05.463
This is a snatch...

23:06.971 --> 23:08.742
And delivery.

23:08.766 --> 23:12.263
Omni Tech Universal
has a alien life form

23:12.287 --> 23:13.298
and our client
wants it returned.

23:13.322 --> 23:14.230
Alien life form, what kind?

23:14.254 --> 23:15.842
You're looking for an alien.

23:17.085 --> 23:17.913
Did I stutter?

23:19.812 --> 23:21.272
You'll know it's an alien

23:21.296 --> 23:24.551
because it's the only
alien in their laboratory.

23:24.575 --> 23:25.725
Need you guys sharp on this one.

23:25.749 --> 23:26.933
You need to pay attention.

23:26.957 --> 23:28.175
No one gets hurt.

23:28.199 --> 23:30.661
This is going to be
clean and by the book.

23:30.685 --> 23:32.248
No unnecessary casualties.

23:32.272 --> 23:34.458
The pay is 10 million credits.

23:34.482 --> 23:36.425
That's 2 million
credits a piece.

23:36.449 --> 23:39.704
That is a hell of a lot of
play money for all of us.

23:39.728 --> 23:41.119
Fuck yeah.

23:41.143 --> 23:42.880
Put my little girl
through college.

23:42.904 --> 23:44.122
I'm gonna pay my bar off

23:44.146 --> 23:45.330
and I'll share that
tuition with you.

23:45.354 --> 23:46.573
I'll hold you to that.

23:46.597 --> 23:48.161
I'll pitch in and get
a hooker for the kid.

23:50.498 --> 23:51.716
Right.

23:51.740 --> 23:52.821
Come on, kid, what's the matter?

23:52.845 --> 23:54.018
Don't you like hookers?

23:54.916 --> 23:56.721
Like them just fine.

23:56.745 --> 24:00.138
You know what a grapefruit
and a pussy have in common?

24:00.162 --> 24:01.416
Store the filth, D.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.486
I said cut the shit!

24:02.510 --> 24:04.419
You're not the kind of me.

24:04.443 --> 24:07.929
Actually, when I'm not
around, Slaughter's in charge.

24:08.895 --> 24:09.827
So he is the king.

24:10.863 --> 24:11.736
Fuck.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.220
Let's go.

24:13.244 --> 24:15.015
That's not funny.

24:15.039 --> 24:16.258
It's kinda funny.

24:16.282 --> 24:17.501
And what the fuck is
up with your hair?

24:17.525 --> 24:19.123
It's like sonic boom.

24:19.147 --> 24:21.470
<i>♪ 'Cause I'm a man</i>

24:21.494 --> 24:25.981

24:28.087 --> 24:29.409
Hey, scientists!

24:29.433 --> 24:32.516
Your lab is a fucking bastard.

24:32.540 --> 24:34.103
Really good to
have you, Mr. Ryker.

24:34.127 --> 24:35.519
Really, really good.

24:35.543 --> 24:38.142
Your reputation precedes you.

24:38.166 --> 24:38.970
You can stop now.

24:38.994 --> 24:40.558
Sorry.

24:40.582 --> 24:41.421
What's going on?

24:41.445 --> 24:42.629
Are we ready to roll?

24:42.653 --> 24:43.561
We're having a bit
of trouble hacking

24:43.585 --> 24:45.183
the OTU server at them moment.

24:45.207 --> 24:46.668
Okay, what does that mean?

24:46.692 --> 24:49.740
As soon as Gus, over
here, finishes up his work,

24:49.764 --> 24:51.155
you'll be golden.

24:51.179 --> 24:53.433
We're going in ahead of
schedule but I think we're fine.

24:53.457 --> 24:56.609
We don't need anyone
caught mid-particle stream.

24:56.633 --> 24:58.438
I've seen it happen,
it's not pleasant.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.327
Get it right.

25:03.778 --> 25:05.652
What happens
if you don't make it?

25:05.676 --> 25:09.345
You implode on
a molecular level.

25:09.369 --> 25:11.037
So basically, you're dead.

25:11.061 --> 25:12.038
Sorta dead.

25:12.062 --> 25:13.315
Sorta dead?

25:13.339 --> 25:15.248
Yeah, it means even
if they get you back,

25:15.272 --> 25:16.974
what comes back ain't sexy.

25:16.998 --> 25:19.286
Most people come
back turned inside out.

25:19.310 --> 25:20.633
It's kinda like
the end of Timecop.

25:20.657 --> 25:21.737
Have you seen that?

25:21.761 --> 25:23.636
Dude, Timecop, fucking classic.

25:23.660 --> 25:24.671
Hell yeah.

25:24.695 --> 25:25.603
Boom!

25:25.627 --> 25:27.225
I fucking love Timecop!

25:27.249 --> 25:28.157
Bros!

25:28.181 --> 25:30.021
No, I fucking hate Timecop.

25:30.045 --> 25:31.046
Fuck Timecop.

25:32.910 --> 25:33.922
So, anyway,

25:33.946 --> 25:35.440
once you're inside,

25:35.464 --> 25:37.201
there's a small window of
time before they figure out

25:37.225 --> 25:39.365
security is down and reboot so,

25:41.194 --> 25:42.333
hit the ground running.

25:43.265 --> 25:44.094
Okay.

25:50.618 --> 25:51.860
Ron swore by you.

25:53.103 --> 25:54.276
You have a job to do.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.038
Can you do your job?

25:59.730 --> 26:00.673
I...

26:00.697 --> 26:02.778
Yes or no, Noob?

26:02.802 --> 26:05.609
I didn't ask for
a goddamn speech.

26:05.633 --> 26:07.876
Can you do your job?

26:09.326 --> 26:10.614
Yes, I can do that job.

26:10.638 --> 26:12.926
That hesitation can
get people killed.

26:12.950 --> 26:14.203
My people.

26:14.227 --> 26:16.516
I need to know that
we can rely on you.

26:16.540 --> 26:18.887
That we can bank on you
and you got our backs.

26:19.957 --> 26:20.786
Yes, sir.

26:22.650 --> 26:23.512
All right.

26:27.206 --> 26:28.172
All right.

26:29.104 --> 26:30.288
Here's the deal.

26:30.312 --> 26:32.290
Lab rats are gonna
drop us into the room.

26:32.314 --> 26:34.845
We're gonna go down
directly to the laboratory.

26:34.869 --> 26:36.536
I've been assured that
there is no one down there,

26:36.560 --> 26:38.089
that we are in an empty space.

26:38.113 --> 26:40.575
We're going five in,
we're going five out.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.093
Got it?

26:42.117 --> 26:42.922
Hoo-wah!

26:42.946 --> 26:43.785
Hoo-wah!

26:43.809 --> 26:44.682
Ooogah!

26:46.777 --> 26:49.584
How long's it usually take?

26:50.781 --> 26:52.690
Digitizing initiated.

26:52.714 --> 26:56.832
Destination OTU Space Station.

26:56.856 --> 26:58.030
Noob, relax.

26:59.652 --> 27:01.285
In a matter of seconds,

27:01.309 --> 27:03.011
we'll all be digitized.

27:08.454 --> 27:10.352
Digitizing complete.

27:23.538 --> 27:24.826
Jesus.

27:24.850 --> 27:26.068
What the fuck is this shit?!

27:26.092 --> 27:27.276
Thought you said this
place would be empty.

27:27.300 --> 27:28.450
They said it would be.

27:28.474 --> 27:30.797
Drop the guns,
scientists, do it now!

27:30.821 --> 27:33.041
I don't think these
are fucking scientists!

27:33.065 --> 27:33.869
Hang on.

27:33.893 --> 27:35.837
All right, all right.

27:35.861 --> 27:37.355
Hello.

27:37.379 --> 27:38.943
Hi there.

27:38.967 --> 27:40.151
Hi there, hello, hello.

27:40.175 --> 27:42.188
Oh, hey, didn't
see you over there.

27:42.212 --> 27:44.949
Yeah, I'm gonna give you
folks a couple options.

27:44.973 --> 27:48.988
Either come back through the
way we came or we open fire.

27:49.012 --> 27:50.955
Yeah, choice is yours.

27:54.431 --> 27:55.270
Shit.

27:56.122 --> 27:57.582
Kill.

27:57.606 --> 27:58.376
Well, you can't say we
didn't give you any options.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.594
Move!

28:09.618 --> 28:10.665
Drop your weapon!

28:10.689 --> 28:11.517
Do it now!

28:13.001 --> 28:15.462
What're you doing
with a gun, scientist?

28:15.486 --> 28:16.695
I'm a physicist.

28:17.903 --> 28:21.158
I have a PHD in alien biology.

28:21.182 --> 28:23.988
I know nothing about these guns.

28:24.012 --> 28:26.059
Uh huh, all right.

28:26.083 --> 28:26.912
Okay.

28:28.948 --> 28:30.639
Tell me, physicist,

28:31.675 --> 28:33.618
you set off any alarms?

28:33.642 --> 28:35.137
No.

28:35.161 --> 28:36.242
Promise?

28:36.266 --> 28:37.761
I swear.

28:37.785 --> 28:39.821
I just need to go, aye?

28:40.788 --> 28:41.616
Okay.

28:42.686 --> 28:44.008
Kill.

28:44.032 --> 28:45.492
You said it would be empty!

28:45.516 --> 28:46.355
What the fuck?!

28:46.379 --> 28:47.805
I know.

28:47.829 --> 28:48.668
Well I almost
got shot by a physicist.

28:48.692 --> 28:51.074
Yeah, I know, I saw!

28:52.661 --> 28:53.846
They told me it would be empty.

28:53.870 --> 28:55.054
Oh, they told you?

28:55.078 --> 28:56.849
What, you trust the
fucking government now?

28:56.873 --> 28:57.919
No.

28:57.943 --> 28:59.437
But their checks clear

28:59.461 --> 29:00.300
and everybody seems to be
okay with that, aren't they?

29:00.324 --> 29:01.543
Bullshit!

29:01.567 --> 29:03.027
This is not what
we signed up for.

29:03.051 --> 29:04.649
This is not what any of
these guys signed up for.

29:04.673 --> 29:05.961
Adam,

29:05.985 --> 29:07.090
what're we going here?

29:10.714 --> 29:12.060
I don't wanna lose the bar.

29:13.096 --> 29:13.924
What?

29:17.617 --> 29:19.481
Ever since I lost
Mary and Bridget,

29:20.448 --> 29:22.806
the bar has become my family.

29:22.830 --> 29:26.154
It's all I got.

29:26.178 --> 29:27.179
I need this!

29:28.663 --> 29:30.665
We need to go, guys, let's move!

29:33.910 --> 29:34.773
Let's move out.

29:36.705 --> 29:39.167
Chances are our arrival
has been announced.

29:39.191 --> 29:40.571
Stay tight, stay on point.

29:53.550 --> 29:54.378
Well,

29:56.173 --> 29:58.003
at least we made it
through in one piece.

29:59.728 --> 30:00.557
Timecop, right?

30:02.145 --> 30:02.973
Yeah.

30:05.286 --> 30:06.114
Yeah.

30:08.703 --> 30:09.531
Let's go.

30:19.300 --> 30:20.449
Hey, Slaughter.

30:20.473 --> 30:21.692
Yeah, boss.

30:21.716 --> 30:23.097
You have those blueprints handy?

30:24.132 --> 30:25.696
Yep.

30:25.720 --> 30:26.548
Bring them up.

30:31.899 --> 30:33.083
We only have a 50 yard range

30:33.107 --> 30:34.947
with these kind of
walls and space.

30:34.971 --> 30:36.500
A 50 yard range is a hell

30:36.524 --> 30:39.434
of a lot better warning then
no warning at all, buddy.

30:39.458 --> 30:41.746
We're headed down to cargo
level five, gentlemen.

30:41.770 --> 30:42.817
That's where she's at.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.542
We're all clear.

31:00.203 --> 31:01.663
Check everybody.

31:01.687 --> 31:03.872
We need to find out
what happened here.

31:03.896 --> 31:05.691
They're all dead, sir.

31:07.866 --> 31:08.867
Overcheck!

31:09.729 --> 31:11.915
I want answers now!

31:11.939 --> 31:14.538
The digitizer logged
in arrival at 10:42.

31:14.562 --> 31:17.472
Were any arrives
cleared at 10:42?

31:17.496 --> 31:18.991
No, sir.

31:19.015 --> 31:20.613
Anything on camera?

31:20.637 --> 31:21.925
Nothing.

31:21.949 --> 31:23.754
Just a blackout logged.

31:23.778 --> 31:24.789
A blackout?

31:24.813 --> 31:25.642
Yes.

31:27.023 --> 31:28.310
That could only
be about four people

31:28.334 --> 31:29.587
on the planet.

31:29.611 --> 31:31.935
Three of them are incarcerated.

31:31.959 --> 31:34.489
I'm sure number
five will be next.

31:34.513 --> 31:36.101
Who's number five?

31:38.966 --> 31:40.736
That's not important.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.107
They're here for the cargo.

31:43.418 --> 31:45.776
Ovecheck, I want you
back to dispatch.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.364
Put everyone on alert.

31:47.388 --> 31:48.952
They guys are good.

31:48.976 --> 31:51.333
If they got the com tech,
and I'm thinking they did,

31:51.357 --> 31:52.956
then we have a serious problem.

31:52.980 --> 31:53.773
Copy.

31:55.430 --> 31:57.063
Come with me.

31:57.087 --> 31:59.894
Welcome to search and define

31:59.918 --> 32:01.471
medical research level.

32:25.909 --> 32:26.806
Very impressive.

32:41.338 --> 32:42.236
Hello, in there.

32:43.927 --> 32:46.250
You are about to do more
for modern science on Earth

32:46.274 --> 32:48.967
than anyone has ever done
in the last 500 years

32:50.692 --> 32:52.567
and I can retire.

32:56.146 --> 32:56.975
Continue.

33:01.807 --> 33:03.233
Have you ever fucked a steak?

33:03.257 --> 33:04.510
It's the most amazing thing.

33:04.534 --> 33:05.442
Here we go.

33:05.466 --> 33:06.961
You're all making me sick.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.686
I mean, I
didn't think it was awful.

33:08.710 --> 33:10.367
Don't act like
you haven't tried.

33:22.103 --> 33:23.080
Anything yet?

33:23.104 --> 33:24.323
Seriously?

33:24.347 --> 33:25.462
Shut the fuck up, Four-Eyes.

33:25.486 --> 33:26.625
Just A-B-B-A back.

33:27.833 --> 33:29.224
Remember that steak I
bought you last month?

33:29.248 --> 33:30.053
Mhmm.

33:32.217 --> 33:34.264
Up close and personal.

33:34.288 --> 33:35.403
A-B-B-A.

33:35.427 --> 33:36.255
A-B-B-A.

33:37.429 --> 33:39.441
It's looking a
little vacant in here.

33:39.465 --> 33:40.995
It's a big ship.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.513
Geeks don't hang
out in hallways.

33:42.537 --> 33:45.378
Geeks like labs and shit.

33:45.402 --> 33:46.621
Yeah, one of those geeks

33:46.645 --> 33:48.381
almost blew my fucking
head off back there.

33:48.405 --> 33:49.382
Okay, let it go!

33:49.406 --> 33:50.625
It was a lucky shot.

33:50.649 --> 33:52.213
Anybody can be lucky once.

33:52.237 --> 33:53.214
Yeah, that's true.

33:53.238 --> 33:54.653
Especially with your sister.

33:56.103 --> 33:58.012
You said you weren't
gonna talk about Tonya.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.116
I can't help it.

33:59.140 --> 34:00.635
She likes to fuck.

34:00.659 --> 34:01.705
Yeah, I like
to fuck, you like to fuck.

34:01.729 --> 34:02.626
So fucking what?

34:03.489 --> 34:04.949
She's fine, man,

34:04.973 --> 34:06.641
and I don't know anybody
here who hasn't fucked her.

34:06.665 --> 34:08.091
If I'm the only
one, I'll shut up.

34:08.114 --> 34:09.126
No, you're not the only one.

34:09.150 --> 34:10.645
Hell, I fucked her.

34:10.668 --> 34:12.094
Before I got married.

34:12.119 --> 34:14.407
And I fucked her too
but you already knew that.

34:14.431 --> 34:15.650
Yeah, that's because I
caught your ass with her.

34:15.674 --> 34:17.710
That's right but at
least you let me finish.

34:19.228 --> 34:20.413
All right.

34:20.437 --> 34:21.449
Is this all you
guys ever talk about?

34:21.473 --> 34:22.474
Sex?

34:23.440 --> 34:24.866
No, we don't talk about sex.

34:24.889 --> 34:26.661
We talk about fucking.

34:26.685 --> 34:28.076
Fucking and steak.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.170
Seem a little crude.

34:30.378 --> 34:31.804
Hey, when we get out
of here, we get back,

34:31.828 --> 34:34.150
I am going to buy you the best

34:34.175 --> 34:37.120
cyborg lap dance
that credits can buy.

34:38.248 --> 34:39.501
Yeah, man.

34:39.525 --> 34:40.916
Once you go neck,
you never go back.

34:41.768 --> 34:43.678
Okay, all right, hey.

34:43.702 --> 34:45.092
Break it up.

34:45.117 --> 34:46.129
That's enough.

34:46.152 --> 34:47.302
All right, Slaughter,

34:47.326 --> 34:48.614
taker Space Jesus,

34:48.638 --> 34:51.237
head on down to
security dispatch.

34:51.261 --> 34:52.652
I need eyes on the whole ship.

34:52.676 --> 34:53.583
Okay?

34:53.608 --> 34:55.344
Scum Bag One, Scum Bag Two,

34:55.369 --> 34:56.829
you're with me,
we're going to cargo.

34:56.853 --> 34:58.486
Let's get this bitch and let's
get the fuck out of here.

34:58.510 --> 34:59.418
Yes, boss.

34:59.442 --> 35:00.902
Roger that, boss.

35:00.926 --> 35:03.007
Come on, Space Jesus,
you're with me, let's go.

35:14.181 --> 35:16.469
Is Boss always such a hard ass?

35:16.493 --> 35:17.425
Shit gets real

35:18.633 --> 35:20.749
and you need someone
good in your corner,

35:20.773 --> 35:22.465
those are the guys
you wanna call.

35:24.260 --> 35:26.893
So D and Four-Eyes
are actually useful?

35:26.917 --> 35:30.852
Look, I trust those
assholes with my life.

35:32.889 --> 35:34.097
Let me tell you something.

35:35.995 --> 35:36.962
20 years ago,

35:38.584 --> 35:42.001
we were in a bar and I had
just asked my wife to marry me.

35:43.037 --> 35:43.934
Fight breaks out

35:44.832 --> 35:46.810
and someone pulls a gun.

35:46.834 --> 35:49.216
Four-Eyes clears the room
and kept my wife safe.

35:51.218 --> 35:54.013
D took a bullet for me.

35:55.394 --> 35:57.027
You don't know what
people are really like

35:57.051 --> 35:59.985
until you have to trust
them with your life.

36:03.644 --> 36:04.645
You ready for this?

36:08.787 --> 36:09.615
Yeah.

36:21.109 --> 36:22.225
Get out of way!

36:22.249 --> 36:24.296
How long you
looking at this for?

36:24.320 --> 36:25.952
Yeah, I thought so.

36:27.392 --> 36:28.334
Fix now!

36:28.358 --> 36:30.198
There's nothing to fix.

36:30.222 --> 36:31.682
Reboot! Reboot system!

36:31.706 --> 36:34.237
It's gonna reboot on its
own in like 20 minutes.

36:34.261 --> 36:35.238
It's not gonna reboot.

36:35.262 --> 36:36.584
We need to see now.

36:36.608 --> 36:38.448
We have breach, fix!

36:38.472 --> 36:41.554
We need to see when someone
gonna shoot in back of head!

36:41.578 --> 36:44.005
Maim.

37:13.300 --> 37:15.519
You are old as shit, man.

37:15.543 --> 37:17.659
Just watch the fucking door.

37:17.683 --> 37:18.626
Boss, come in.

37:18.650 --> 37:19.558
Here.

37:19.582 --> 37:20.800
We got to dispatch.

37:20.824 --> 37:22.216
Ran into some unfriendlies.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.458
That's a real shame.

37:23.482 --> 37:25.011
Sorry to hear that.

37:25.035 --> 37:26.323
Hey, patch that camera feed in

37:26.347 --> 37:28.774
so we can get eyes
on the whole place.

37:28.798 --> 37:30.455
Give me one minute.

37:32.595 --> 37:34.745
Overcheck, come in.

37:34.769 --> 37:36.668
Overcheck, do you copy?

37:43.364 --> 37:44.607
Sorry, comrade.

37:45.608 --> 37:47.448
Was held up.

37:47.472 --> 37:48.794
Doing what?

37:48.818 --> 37:50.302
Had to dehydrate

37:52.339 --> 37:54.040
around corner.

37:54.064 --> 37:55.249
That's disgusting.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.871
Are back at dispatch?

37:56.895 --> 37:58.148
Affirmative.

37:58.172 --> 38:00.184
Get those cameras back online.

38:00.208 --> 38:01.496
Understood.

38:01.520 --> 38:02.866
Over and out.

38:06.974 --> 38:08.883
Sounded a little more
German than Russian

38:08.907 --> 38:10.125
at the end there, pal.

38:10.149 --> 38:12.749
I didn't think it
sounded half bad.

38:12.773 --> 38:13.957
Ra'hmar,

38:13.981 --> 38:15.717
take them up to level
five, run a sweep.

38:15.741 --> 38:18.030
Report back to be
as soon as you can.

38:18.054 --> 38:19.618
Move out.

39:10.451 --> 39:11.314
Fuck!

39:30.022 --> 39:31.023
All right.

39:32.680 --> 39:33.509
Give it a shot.

39:35.752 --> 39:36.615
Tap the side

39:37.754 --> 39:40.136
and it should cycle
through all the cameras.

39:46.142 --> 39:47.385
Not bad, kid.

39:49.421 --> 39:51.882
All right, boss,
you're good to go.

39:51.906 --> 39:54.264
We're sending the feed
to your pieces now.

39:54.288 --> 39:55.427
Good job, kid.

39:58.637 --> 39:59.959
I ain't standing
around doing nothing.

39:59.983 --> 40:03.135
I want to shoot
some motherfuckers.

40:03.159 --> 40:04.792
I'm dying for a
fucking steak, man.

40:04.816 --> 40:06.093
Just settle down.

40:08.164 --> 40:10.142
All the other feeds are clear.

40:10.166 --> 40:11.385
Everything is clean.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.214
Except level five,
laboratory wing.

40:13.238 --> 40:14.422
Foggy as hell.

40:14.446 --> 40:15.699
Wow, that's fucking great.

40:15.723 --> 40:19.323
Elevator arrived.

40:29.668 --> 40:30.473
How many?

40:30.497 --> 40:31.335
What?

40:31.359 --> 40:33.683
I said, how many?

40:38.505 --> 40:39.551
I don't know.

40:39.575 --> 40:40.414
10?

40:40.438 --> 40:41.725
20?

40:43.475 --> 40:45.142
Five of the Russians.

40:45.166 --> 40:47.248
Come on, kid, you can
crack security feeds

40:47.272 --> 40:48.974
but your eyes can't count?

40:55.383 --> 40:56.833
All right, five.

40:59.491 --> 41:01.987
Negative, that's four.

41:06.325 --> 41:07.820
Degenerate,

41:07.844 --> 41:10.029
I really hope that that's the
nozzle of your gun on my leg.

41:10.053 --> 41:11.859
I'm just happy to see you.

41:18.579 --> 41:19.798
We need more.

41:19.822 --> 41:21.133
Get your ass some
target practice.

41:24.447 --> 41:25.631
Do you have my
camera feed up yet?

41:25.655 --> 41:26.484
Yes, sir.

41:34.146 --> 41:36.124
Keep the elevators on.

41:36.148 --> 41:38.195
I want to pin them on five.

41:38.219 --> 41:39.024
Yes, sir.

41:39.048 --> 41:39.956
Let's go.

41:43.570 --> 41:44.408
It stopped.

41:44.432 --> 41:45.755
No shit, it stopped.

41:47.090 --> 41:48.620
Shit, someone knows we're here.

41:48.644 --> 41:49.472
Put them in.

41:56.479 --> 41:59.009
Shit, is that an EMP grenade?

42:09.941 --> 42:10.769
Well,

42:12.012 --> 42:13.507
I win.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.533
Points for efficiency,
kid, but don't get cocky.

42:16.430 --> 42:17.396
Boss, we're good.

42:20.848 --> 42:21.677
Boss?

42:27.993 --> 42:29.177
Visual on elevators out.

42:29.201 --> 42:30.686
Guess we're taking the stairs.

42:43.837 --> 42:45.124
Come on!

43:21.046 --> 43:22.368
Shit.

43:22.392 --> 43:23.922
Come on.

43:23.946 --> 43:24.854
Come on!

43:24.878 --> 43:25.613
I'm coming.

43:39.237 --> 43:40.041
Come on!

43:40.065 --> 43:40.870
Yeah!

43:40.894 --> 43:41.802
Yeah!

43:55.771 --> 43:57.369
Kill.

44:13.133 --> 44:14.410
Jesus Christ.

44:16.861 --> 44:19.702
So that's how you got
your fucking call sign.

44:19.726 --> 44:22.314
I seen some shit in my time.

44:24.282 --> 44:25.317
We gotta go.

44:28.355 --> 44:29.770
Elevator arrived.

44:36.743 --> 44:39.066
That's enough, they're dead.

44:39.090 --> 44:41.333
Take the bodies to
the incinerator.

45:08.360 --> 45:09.268
Boss, can we spit

45:09.292 --> 45:11.639
these fucking things out now?

45:19.855 --> 45:21.833
You may get a shot off.

45:21.857 --> 45:23.627
You might no miss

45:23.651 --> 45:26.147
but I'll take all
three of you with me.

45:26.171 --> 45:27.966
You wanna make a
bet on that shit?

45:29.485 --> 45:30.876
Set the weapons down.

45:30.900 --> 45:31.808
Let's keep it civil.

45:31.832 --> 45:33.810
Look at the bodies, man.

45:33.834 --> 45:35.847
I think we're way
beyond being civil.

45:35.871 --> 45:37.641
They're just hired badges.

45:37.665 --> 45:39.264
They're not killers like you.

45:39.288 --> 45:40.472
Wait a minute.

45:40.496 --> 45:41.324
Wait a minute.

45:42.601 --> 45:43.820
I know you.

45:43.844 --> 45:44.707
You do?

45:46.398 --> 45:48.159
Bruce Miller.

45:49.022 --> 45:50.137
Biotech engineer.

45:50.161 --> 45:51.621
US Marines.

45:51.645 --> 45:53.347
Now Secretary of
Inter-planetary Relations.

45:53.371 --> 45:54.510
Is that it?

45:56.201 --> 45:57.420
How you been, Ryker?

45:57.444 --> 45:58.697
Cut the bullshit.

45:58.721 --> 46:00.181
Just being polite.

46:00.205 --> 46:01.458
This doesn't look like

46:01.482 --> 46:02.805
a government sanctioned
operation here, Miller.

46:02.829 --> 46:03.657
It's not.

46:05.555 --> 46:07.212
What the hell's going on?

46:08.282 --> 46:09.846
Gene splicing.

46:09.870 --> 46:11.814
Using alien DNA to benefit ours

46:11.838 --> 46:13.954
and it will pay me more
than an entire career

46:13.978 --> 46:15.393
in politics ever would.

46:16.566 --> 46:20.029
Take us to it and
we won't kill you.

46:20.053 --> 46:22.134
You're dumber than you look.

46:22.158 --> 46:24.136
That would be a federal crime.

46:24.160 --> 46:25.828
And that's why we're
calling the POTUS

46:25.852 --> 46:27.588
when this is all said and done.

46:27.612 --> 46:29.866
It'll be your word against mine.

46:29.890 --> 46:32.455
None of you have
the best reputation.

46:32.479 --> 46:34.284
You really don't know what
you're deal with here, do you?

46:37.587 --> 46:38.841
Wanna see if you
can drop that faster

46:38.865 --> 46:40.245
than I can pull the trigger?

46:42.316 --> 46:44.674
Francis, I knew it was you.

46:46.217 --> 46:47.252
Francis?

46:48.944 --> 46:50.853
Your name's fucking Francis?

46:50.877 --> 46:51.819
It's Frankie.

46:51.843 --> 46:52.671
Frank.

46:54.190 --> 46:54.984
Noob's fine.

46:56.986 --> 46:58.205
The only person I knew

46:58.229 --> 46:59.793
who could hack into
the network here.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.197
You know this asshole?

47:02.164 --> 47:03.520
Yeah,

47:03.544 --> 47:05.212
I did my grad school
internship at the White House.

47:07.859 --> 47:09.757
Well color me fucking impressed.

47:12.588 --> 47:14.531
Means a lot, D, thanks.

47:14.555 --> 47:15.878
You're welcome, Francis.

47:18.180 --> 47:19.743
I'm pulling the trigger now.

47:19.767 --> 47:20.848
Go ahead.

47:20.872 --> 47:22.436
I'll drop it anyway.

47:22.460 --> 47:24.151
Do it, I'm a good catch.

47:25.394 --> 47:26.612
Besides, I can tell by
the sweat in your brow

47:26.636 --> 47:27.672
that you're bluffing.

47:29.087 --> 47:31.376
I drop this, I
do you all a favor.

47:31.400 --> 47:32.584
But you won't.

47:32.608 --> 47:34.403
It's not your style.

47:35.645 --> 47:37.199
You like money too much.

47:40.064 --> 47:40.858
You got me.

47:44.344 --> 47:45.517
Damn good work, kid.

47:46.829 --> 47:47.657
Take us to it.

47:49.280 --> 47:50.108
Now.

48:03.190 --> 48:05.962
Welcome to Sub-level Five.

48:05.986 --> 48:06.849
Clear.

48:09.058 --> 48:09.887
Clear.

48:15.099 --> 48:16.272
What the hell?

48:24.108 --> 48:26.396
Is this the right room?

48:26.420 --> 48:27.249
Damn.

48:30.114 --> 48:31.712
I tried to warn you.

48:31.736 --> 48:33.196
Are you kidding me?

48:33.220 --> 48:36.406
This was supposed to be
a simple snatch and grab.

48:36.430 --> 48:38.546
What the hell is
going on here, Miller?

48:43.092 --> 48:44.266
Oh, God.

48:46.164 --> 48:47.728
You didn't put a lot of
thought into this mission

48:47.752 --> 48:49.133
before you took it, did you?

48:50.962 --> 48:52.802
So you're gonna lose the bar.

48:52.826 --> 48:53.965
Big fucking deal.

48:56.968 --> 48:57.865
Look around you!

48:59.557 --> 49:01.179
This is a fucking
suicide mission.

49:02.180 --> 49:03.009
Tell him.

49:04.217 --> 49:05.919
Come on, tell these guys!

49:05.943 --> 49:07.127
Tell them what
they're doing here,

49:07.151 --> 49:09.681
risking their lives for
a simple, what is it?

49:09.705 --> 49:10.706
"Snatch and grab?"

49:12.052 --> 49:13.996
This is bullshit, boss.

49:14.020 --> 49:14.882
All of it.

49:17.092 --> 49:19.208
We're not even
supposed to be here!

49:21.096 --> 49:22.269
Let's just go.

49:24.409 --> 49:27.009
You're on thin ice, my friend.

49:29.311 --> 49:30.771
Where else are we
supposed to go?

49:30.795 --> 49:31.565
You're gonna
get a shot in my fucking side.

49:31.589 --> 49:32.773
Seriously?

49:32.797 --> 49:33.981
Is that's what's gonna happen?

49:34.005 --> 49:35.465
Are you fucking kidding me?!

49:35.489 --> 49:36.397
There wasn't
supposed to be anybody here.

49:36.421 --> 49:37.433
That's what I was told.

49:37.457 --> 49:38.089
We already had
this conversation...

49:38.113 --> 49:39.021
Boss!

49:39.045 --> 49:40.505
This is horse shit!

49:40.529 --> 49:41.575
You know what's horseshit,
your fucking attitude!

49:41.599 --> 49:42.403
Boss!

49:42.427 --> 49:43.232
I can't look away!

49:43.256 --> 49:44.888
I can't look away!

49:52.575 --> 49:54.139
Son of a bitch!

49:54.163 --> 49:55.061
Goddamn it!

49:59.479 --> 50:00.628
D, no!

50:00.652 --> 50:01.457
Oh, no!

50:01.481 --> 50:02.309
Oh, no!

50:03.724 --> 50:05.771
Help me! Help me!

50:05.795 --> 50:07.463
Do something!

50:07.487 --> 50:08.315
D!

50:13.872 --> 50:15.195
No, no, no, no, no.

50:15.219 --> 50:16.047
Hey, hey.

50:17.083 --> 50:18.784
Hey, buddy.

50:18.808 --> 50:19.637
Come on.

50:20.603 --> 50:21.432
No.

50:22.743 --> 50:23.572
D, D!

50:29.854 --> 50:31.062
This is on you.

50:32.305 --> 50:34.238
This is on fucking you!

50:37.689 --> 50:40.116
We gotta keep moving.

50:40.140 --> 50:42.867
Five pieces down,
set the motion.

50:58.193 --> 51:00.022
Ah, D, come on, man.

51:01.472 --> 51:02.576
Come on, we gotta go.

51:04.682 --> 51:05.786
We gotta go, let's go.

51:12.138 --> 51:14.657
You gonna be all right, man?

51:22.665 --> 51:24.195
D?

51:34.608 --> 51:35.851
Son of a bitch.

52:24.106 --> 52:25.245
Keep moving.

52:41.261 --> 52:44.102
So what can you tell
me about this thing?

52:44.126 --> 52:45.748
You didn't see enough yet?

52:47.233 --> 52:48.441
Just talk.

52:49.890 --> 52:50.960
What is this thing?

52:52.479 --> 52:53.963
It's from the Sharak System.

52:55.724 --> 52:56.908
Warriors.

52:56.932 --> 52:58.002
Half truth.

52:59.245 --> 53:01.602
It's half Sharak Ti,
half something else.

53:01.626 --> 53:04.640
Crossbred with another
specials from the system.

53:04.664 --> 53:05.803
What species?

53:06.666 --> 53:07.988
We don't know.

53:08.012 --> 53:09.496
But something much worse.

53:10.704 --> 53:11.750
The Sharak Ti seem
to have created it

53:11.774 --> 53:14.167
as some sort of bio weapon.

53:14.191 --> 53:16.365
The Sharak Ti aren't
exactly happy.

53:17.573 --> 53:19.920
POTUS wants to sway an
interplanetary incident.

53:25.995 --> 53:27.387
Why?

53:27.411 --> 53:29.630
I know something more dangerous.

53:29.654 --> 53:30.483
Yeah,

53:31.346 --> 53:32.564
us and D.

53:44.324 --> 53:45.784
It knows we're here.

53:45.808 --> 53:47.269
It's smart.

53:47.293 --> 53:48.270
We're sitting ducks here.

53:48.294 --> 53:49.271
Shut up.

53:50.882 --> 53:51.711
Thank you.

54:02.308 --> 54:03.170
Shit.

54:09.176 --> 54:10.292
Left!

54:15.976 --> 54:19.301
Above! Up!

54:29.266 --> 54:30.173
Watch my back.

54:30.197 --> 54:31.830
Only if you watch mine!

54:31.854 --> 54:32.831
That thing killed my brother.

54:32.855 --> 54:33.660
He was my brother too.

54:33.684 --> 54:35.420
Don't get stupid!

55:08.374 --> 55:09.178
Get away! Get away!

55:09.202 --> 55:10.766
Get away from it!

55:15.381 --> 55:16.382
Four-Eyes!

55:18.694 --> 55:21.604
Four-Eyes, answer
me, goddamn it!

55:49.484 --> 55:50.347
Adam!

55:57.388 --> 55:58.641
I got you, I got you.

55:58.665 --> 55:59.470
I got you.

56:01.841 --> 56:02.669
Help me.

56:08.157 --> 56:08.986
Oh, man.

56:09.883 --> 56:13.035
Stay back, this is spreading.

56:13.059 --> 56:14.543
You're contagious.

56:17.719 --> 56:18.616
Can we help him?

56:19.928 --> 56:21.526
Yeah.

56:21.550 --> 56:23.666
We could put him
out of his misery.

56:23.690 --> 56:25.668
For Christ sakes, boss, we're
in a medical research lab.

56:25.692 --> 56:28.430
We'll never make it!

56:28.454 --> 56:29.282
He's dying.

56:30.456 --> 56:31.353
We have no choice.

56:34.287 --> 56:35.782
Alfonso,

56:37.808 --> 56:39.948
I am so sorry

56:41.639 --> 56:43.652
for throwing you into this.

56:45.471 --> 56:46.920
This is my fault.

56:49.233 --> 56:50.855
You were one hell of a solider.

56:53.513 --> 56:55.204
You were a better friend.

56:56.205 --> 56:57.414
I failed you, buddy.

57:07.285 --> 57:08.642
Slaughter.

57:08.666 --> 57:09.471
Yeah, boss.

57:09.495 --> 57:11.162
Come here, man.

57:11.186 --> 57:12.187
Pick him up.

57:13.119 --> 57:14.120
Pick him up.

57:30.412 --> 57:32.183
God speed, buddy.

57:48.672 --> 57:49.500
Oh.

57:53.539 --> 57:55.413
Motherfucking son of a bitch!

57:55.437 --> 57:56.897
This is all your fault!

57:56.921 --> 57:58.934
You knew about this! You knew!

57:58.958 --> 58:00.097
Boss!

58:04.515 --> 58:05.561
Slaughter.

58:05.585 --> 58:06.528
Yeah, boss.

58:06.552 --> 58:07.622
We gotta finish it.

58:08.968 --> 58:10.038
We gotta finish it.

58:11.867 --> 58:14.594
If we don't, I lose the bar.

58:17.563 --> 58:18.678
So that's what's up?

58:18.702 --> 58:20.403
Yeah, that's what's up.

58:20.427 --> 58:21.636
Alfonso was right?

58:23.051 --> 58:24.269
Yeah, man.

58:24.293 --> 58:26.030
He was right.

58:26.054 --> 58:28.653
If you were in trouble, why
didn't you come and talk to me?

58:28.677 --> 58:30.310
You got a little
girl, you got a family.

58:30.334 --> 58:31.898
I couldn't do that to you.

58:31.922 --> 58:33.624
I couldn't drag you into this.

58:33.648 --> 58:37.006
You've had my back
since we were kids.

58:37.030 --> 58:40.941
I say let's go turn this
asshole to the government

58:40.965 --> 58:42.460
and let's get the
fuck out of here.

58:42.484 --> 58:44.427
Maybe they can figure
something out to help you.

58:44.451 --> 58:45.981
Yeah, right.

58:46.005 --> 58:48.663
The last time I trusted
them I lost my family.

58:50.078 --> 58:51.952
But that doesn't mean we're
not making a phone call.

58:51.976 --> 58:53.012
Let's go asshole.

01:00:12.885 --> 01:00:14.345
What the fuck was that?!

01:00:14.369 --> 01:00:15.346
Keep down!

01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:16.278
Move!

01:00:16.302 --> 01:00:17.797
Go!

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.289
Once again, thank you, everyone.

01:00:27.313 --> 01:00:31.396
Prime Minister Girardi and I
are very proud to take credit

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:35.193
for our two nations forging
and unprecedented partnership

01:00:35.217 --> 01:00:38.231
through this strategic dialogue.

01:00:38.255 --> 01:00:42.649
But today I want to come
by and express my gratitude

01:00:42.673 --> 01:00:44.099
to all in attendance.

01:00:44.123 --> 01:00:46.688
Not only to Secretary Murdoch

01:00:46.712 --> 01:00:49.691
but to Prime Minister Girardi

01:00:49.715 --> 01:00:52.107
and everybody in this room

01:00:52.131 --> 01:00:56.974
who are actually doing the hard
word of advancing the goals

01:00:56.998 --> 01:01:00.460
set forward by the
Prime Minister and I

01:01:00.484 --> 01:01:02.393
in our bilateral meetings.

01:01:03.867 --> 01:01:04.764
Call her!

01:01:06.283 --> 01:01:07.077
Do it!

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.305
Unprecedented partnership?

01:01:18.329 --> 01:01:20.583
Is that what you
call a trade embargo

01:01:20.607 --> 01:01:23.897
that lines the pockets of
the prime ministers here?

01:01:23.921 --> 01:01:27.521
Children are being wasted
in sweatshops in Tyrone.

01:01:27.545 --> 01:01:29.282
Congressman Lawton,

01:01:29.306 --> 01:01:32.043
I can assure you that
this has been investigated

01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:34.632
and there has been
no evidence of these

01:01:34.656 --> 01:01:36.693
so-called sweatshops in Tyrone.

01:01:48.566 --> 01:01:50.061
Once again,

01:01:50.085 --> 01:01:51.442
thank you everyone

01:01:51.466 --> 01:01:54.676
and I look forward
to a positive future.

01:02:14.454 --> 01:02:16.432
Miller.

01:02:16.456 --> 01:02:17.388
What is this?

01:02:18.665 --> 01:02:22.266
There's been a malfunction.

01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:23.394
Good morning, Ellen.

01:02:25.431 --> 01:02:26.812
Call me Madam President.

01:02:28.227 --> 01:02:29.193
Madam President,

01:02:30.298 --> 01:02:32.310
got a bit of a problem up here.

01:02:32.334 --> 01:02:35.210
Your alien liaison hasn't
been entirely honest with you.

01:02:35.234 --> 01:02:36.038
Adam?

01:02:36.062 --> 01:02:37.764
You can call me Boss.

01:02:37.788 --> 01:02:38.755
Boss.

01:02:40.032 --> 01:02:41.319
What is the issue?

01:02:41.343 --> 01:02:42.735
The issue, Madam President,

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:45.151
is that Weathers
hired my team and I

01:02:45.175 --> 01:02:47.291
to extract an alien life form

01:02:47.315 --> 01:02:49.396
that we now know to
be a biological weapon

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.398
owned by the Sharak Ti.

01:02:51.422 --> 01:02:52.606
While returning it would be

01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:54.781
a really nice
gesture on our part,

01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:58.129
your friend, here,
has some other plans!

01:02:58.153 --> 01:03:00.925
Why don't you tell her
all about it, friend?

01:03:05.678 --> 01:03:08.681
What are your
other ideas, Miller?

01:03:11.063 --> 01:03:12.616
I moonlight with Omni Tech.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.170
Shit, I own the company now.

01:03:16.413 --> 01:03:17.631
I hired a mercenary team

01:03:17.655 --> 01:03:19.944
lead my former Navy
Seal Alexander Murphy.

01:03:19.968 --> 01:03:21.004
Who he killed.

01:03:22.177 --> 01:03:23.672
To board a Sharak Ti vessel

01:03:23.696 --> 01:03:25.605
and apprehend a bio-weapon
they were crossbreeding

01:03:25.629 --> 01:03:26.630
on their home world.

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:31.576
How do you know about
this crossbreeding?

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.200
Through a radio
transmission I intercepted.

01:03:34.224 --> 01:03:37.158
I am your Secretary of
Extraterrestrial Affairs after all.

01:03:38.262 --> 01:03:39.861
That's why you appointed me.

01:03:39.885 --> 01:03:41.310
You mean to tell
me that you hijacked

01:03:41.334 --> 01:03:43.992
a hostile alien
vessel for profit?

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.514
That I did.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:53.840
The American dream is
still alive and well.

01:03:53.864 --> 01:03:54.979
Oh,

01:03:55.003 --> 01:03:56.073
not anymore.

01:03:57.350 --> 01:03:59.594
I am relieving you
of your duties.

01:04:00.802 --> 01:04:02.884
If interplanetary
was was to happen,

01:04:02.908 --> 01:04:05.438
I'd rather have the guy
standing next to you,

01:04:05.462 --> 01:04:09.062
who has already saved our
asses once fighting for us,

01:04:09.086 --> 01:04:09.915
than you.

01:04:13.021 --> 01:04:14.851
Your services are
no longer needed.

01:04:16.197 --> 01:04:17.691
Goodbye, Miller.

01:04:17.715 --> 01:04:20.004
Real sorry to hear you lost
two jobs in one day, buddy.

01:04:20.028 --> 01:04:20.857
Let's go!

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:24.319
I don't know about you

01:04:24.343 --> 01:04:26.183
but I'm selling all my
shares at Omni Tech.

01:04:26.207 --> 01:04:27.046
Yeah.

01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:28.633
Fuck him.

01:05:19.674 --> 01:05:24.655
I guess we got no other choice
now but just to shoot you.

01:05:24.679 --> 01:05:25.483
Any objections?

01:05:25.507 --> 01:05:26.415
None from me.

01:05:26.439 --> 01:05:27.244
No.

01:05:46.218 --> 01:05:47.471
All right, Miller.

01:05:47.495 --> 01:05:49.369
Sorry to have to do this.

01:05:56.262 --> 01:05:59.103
This thing knows how to
operate a power generator now.

01:05:59.127 --> 01:06:00.104
Of course it does.

01:06:00.128 --> 01:06:01.623
It's smart.

01:06:01.647 --> 01:06:04.660
How many times do I got to
tell you to shut the fuck up?!

01:06:04.684 --> 01:06:06.731
Go ahead, pull the trigger.

01:06:06.755 --> 01:06:08.388
Why stop the inevitable?

01:06:24.152 --> 01:06:25.153
We got company.

01:06:28.329 --> 01:06:29.847
Real slow, guys.

01:06:31.125 --> 01:06:31.988
Real slow.

01:06:33.368 --> 01:06:35.174
Shit.

01:06:35.198 --> 01:06:37.855
We already saw what
this thing can do.

01:06:48.176 --> 01:06:49.074
I got an idea.

01:06:50.454 --> 01:06:53.733
Everybody behind Miller.

01:06:54.872 --> 01:06:56.160
Oh yeah, thanks.

01:06:56.184 --> 01:06:57.679
Consider this a
tax payer's thank you

01:06:57.703 --> 01:06:59.843
for all your years
of wonderful service.

01:07:11.268 --> 01:07:12.269
I'm sorry.

01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:23.429
Let's move, let's move,
let's move, let's move!

01:07:23.453 --> 01:07:25.948
Up those air holes now!

01:07:25.972 --> 01:07:28.848
Digitizer room's gotta
be around here somewhere.

01:08:04.425 --> 01:08:05.702
Through here.

01:08:11.156 --> 01:08:12.719
Come on, kid, so you know
what you're doing on that thing?

01:08:12.743 --> 01:08:13.720
Can you make it work?!

01:08:13.744 --> 01:08:14.825
I can figure it out.

01:08:14.849 --> 01:08:16.240
Let's go, don't get fancy.

01:08:16.264 --> 01:08:18.587
First coordinates you find
let's get the fuck out of here!

01:08:18.611 --> 01:08:20.624
Come on, kid, let's move!

01:08:20.648 --> 01:08:21.866
Got it!

01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:23.109
Come on, let's go, let's go!

01:08:23.133 --> 01:08:24.352
You guys ever been
to the White House?

01:08:24.376 --> 01:08:25.524
What house, yeah, that's great!

01:08:25.549 --> 01:08:26.768
Thank you, Space Jesus.

01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:28.551
Where the fuck is your gun, kid?

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:31.935
Boss!

01:08:34.524 --> 01:08:36.502
DNA recognition rejected.

01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:40.161
Boss, stay with me!

01:08:40.185 --> 01:08:41.013
Boss.

01:08:43.671 --> 01:08:44.751
Stay with me, boss.

01:08:44.774 --> 01:08:46.098
Stay with me.

01:09:01.585 --> 01:09:03.667
I think he's hit.

01:09:03.691 --> 01:09:05.358
Boss, are you okay?

01:09:05.381 --> 01:09:06.290
I'm fine.

01:09:06.314 --> 01:09:07.694
It's nothing, it's nothing.

01:09:09.109 --> 01:09:10.328
Come on, man.

01:09:10.353 --> 01:09:11.502
It's just a little
scratch, come on.

01:09:11.526 --> 01:09:13.631
I think we're under
the White House.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.197
Underground railroad.

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:17.059
Yes.

01:09:17.082 --> 01:09:18.233
What?

01:09:23.849 --> 01:09:24.850
It's here.

01:09:26.368 --> 01:09:27.415
It's here.

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:28.957
It's fucking here.

01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:32.212
Let's go, get the gun!

01:09:32.237 --> 01:09:33.938
Get my gun!

01:09:35.654 --> 01:09:36.758
Go! Go! Go!

01:09:40.348 --> 01:09:41.359
Come on, we gotta go.

01:09:41.384 --> 01:09:43.362
Come on, we can make it!

01:09:43.386 --> 01:09:44.948
Faster, come on!

01:10:03.164 --> 01:10:04.993
Slower, kid, slower.

01:10:16.557 --> 01:10:17.810
All right, we're almost
there, boss, almost there.

01:10:17.834 --> 01:10:19.501
Just a flesh wound.

01:10:48.451 --> 01:10:49.762
It's thinking.

01:10:51.454 --> 01:10:53.604
I can see it, it's thinking.

01:10:53.628 --> 01:10:54.664
Just like us.

01:11:01.498 --> 01:11:03.649
I can see it in its
eyes, it's thinking.

01:11:03.673 --> 01:11:04.995
Great.

01:11:05.019 --> 01:11:06.997
Kill the motherfucker.

01:11:11.543 --> 01:11:14.315
What's your plan, kid?

01:11:14.339 --> 01:11:15.350
You set him up

01:11:15.374 --> 01:11:16.962
and I'll take him out.

01:11:18.204 --> 01:11:20.113
Do it! Do it!

01:11:20.137 --> 01:11:21.529
Take him out!

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:32.298
Take him out!

01:11:32.322 --> 01:11:33.461
Take the shot!

01:11:35.049 --> 01:11:36.613
Take him out, goddamn it!

01:11:36.637 --> 01:11:37.476
You got it.

01:11:38.363 --> 01:11:40.064
Almost there.

01:11:40.088 --> 01:11:40.893
Fuck!

01:11:48.165 --> 01:11:49.246
Gun is jammed!

01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:50.730
Goddamn it!

01:11:50.754 --> 01:11:51.973
Slaughter!

01:11:51.997 --> 01:11:54.068
Drop the goddamn shooter.

01:11:56.588 --> 01:11:57.806
Save the kid!

01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:58.866
Save the kid!

01:12:05.113 --> 01:12:06.677
Adam! No! No!

01:12:09.532 --> 01:12:11.637
Come on, kid, let's move!

01:12:41.978 --> 01:12:44.439
Come on, kid,
let's go, let's go!

01:12:56.544 --> 01:12:57.935
What was that?

01:12:57.959 --> 01:13:00.144
I don't know but it definitely
came from underground.

01:13:00.168 --> 01:13:02.112
You think it's an attack?

01:13:02.136 --> 01:13:03.251
I've fought in wars.

01:13:03.275 --> 01:13:04.552
That was barely a tremor.

01:13:12.767 --> 01:13:14.193
Well, well, well.

01:13:14.217 --> 01:13:16.668
If it isn't fuck and you.

01:13:17.634 --> 01:13:19.854
How the hell did
you get in here?

01:13:19.878 --> 01:13:21.258
Same way Kennedy got out.

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:23.778
And each one after that.

01:13:24.779 --> 01:13:26.402
They all had their affairs.

01:13:28.093 --> 01:13:28.921
Where's Ryker?

01:13:30.233 --> 01:13:31.061
He's gone.

01:13:33.339 --> 01:13:34.168
Gone?

01:13:35.514 --> 01:13:36.377
Dead.

01:13:37.309 --> 01:13:38.137
I see.

01:13:39.829 --> 01:13:41.358
I'll mourn at the funeral.

01:13:41.382 --> 01:13:42.521
This is business.

01:13:45.075 --> 01:13:47.088
What kind of business?

01:13:47.112 --> 01:13:47.906
Payment.

01:13:49.735 --> 01:13:50.736
Where's the cargo?

01:13:51.944 --> 01:13:53.049
It's in the tunnels.

01:13:54.602 --> 01:13:56.028
That wasn't part of the deal.

01:13:56.052 --> 01:13:58.479
We really didn't
have much of a choice.

01:13:58.503 --> 01:14:02.127
We couldn't very well let
this thing follow us up here.

01:14:03.128 --> 01:14:03.956
Could we?

01:14:06.165 --> 01:14:08.696
The Sharak Ti are coming for it.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:09.962
You know that, right?

01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:12.758
Yes.

01:14:13.932 --> 01:14:15.381
There are still a
few pieces left.

01:14:18.384 --> 01:14:20.110
You're one of the
good ones, Ellen.

01:14:20.939 --> 01:14:21.905
You're not corrupt.

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.091
You're idealistic

01:14:25.115 --> 01:14:26.496
and I saw that in you.

01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:29.741
But if you wanna
win another term,

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.434
now's the time to prove
why you deserve it.

01:14:34.642 --> 01:14:35.988
And don't forget that pay.

01:14:38.266 --> 01:14:39.095
So that's

01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:43.789
two million credits for
each of your, right?

01:14:45.135 --> 01:14:46.423
Correct.

01:14:46.447 --> 01:14:48.736
Plus the shares from the others.

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:51.694
We need them to go to D
and Four-Eyes' next of kin.

01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:53.558
Okay.

01:14:55.352 --> 01:14:56.871
I have both of their files.

01:14:58.321 --> 01:14:59.391
I'll track them down.

01:15:00.979 --> 01:15:02.359
What about Ryker's share?

01:15:03.326 --> 01:15:04.579
Oh, don't worry.

01:15:04.603 --> 01:15:06.191
It's gonna be put to good use.

01:15:10.609 --> 01:15:11.472
Madam President.

01:15:12.818 --> 01:15:13.647
Thank you.

01:15:18.099 --> 01:15:19.629
Better prepare for war.

01:15:22.069 --> 01:15:22.897
Well played.

01:15:28.282 --> 01:15:30.156
Our old pal, Ryker.

01:15:58.174 --> 01:15:59.900
Yo, where's the old man?

01:16:02.143 --> 01:16:03.327
Hey busboy,

01:16:03.351 --> 01:16:04.915
where's boss!

01:16:08.978 --> 01:16:10.738
I ain't the busboy.

01:16:34.728 --> 01:16:36.246
Thank you, everyone.

01:16:58.821 --> 01:17:02.272
The Sharak Ti are going
to be looking for it.

01:17:03.273 --> 01:17:06.207
The Sharak Ti are coming for it.

01:17:07.519 --> 01:17:09.728
Does this mean war?

01:17:10.867 --> 01:17:13.501
