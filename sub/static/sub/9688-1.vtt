00:36.533 --> 00:38.442
This is a very old story...

00:39.002 --> 00:42.093
of a woman whose name was Lachchi.

00:44.458 --> 00:45.466
But, granny...

00:45.640 --> 00:47.714
...Laachi wished for a prince charming
from this very village, didn't she?

00:47.969 --> 00:49.875
Or someone who could live
with her family.

00:50.054 --> 00:51.996
Someone tall, dark and handsome.

00:52.451 --> 00:54.146
What made you settle for someone
from miles away?

00:54.538 --> 00:57.629
Actually the coconut (token) came from
Bhanwar Seth of Navalgarh.

00:57.838 --> 00:59.368
...for his son Kishanlal.

00:59.749 --> 01:03.295
That brought in this change of mind.

01:04.894 --> 01:06.589
Enough of the jokes.

01:10.768 --> 01:12.155
Lachchi, child!

01:24.774 --> 01:29.456
Your granny had offered these
at the time of my wedding.

01:30.059 --> 01:32.037
My o' my! lt's so beautiful!

01:32.422 --> 01:37.529
We both are so fortunate to deck
you up in these ornaments.

01:38.053 --> 01:40.302
And this drape as well.

01:42.709 --> 01:46.146
Don't lift the veil on your own!
Now it will be him who will lift it!

01:48.687 --> 01:51.780
What if he forgets to lift
the veil and goes to sleep?

01:54.249 --> 01:56.298
Who?
Your Kishan?

01:58.140 --> 02:00.676
Silly girl! No man sleeps
on his wedding night...

02:00.887 --> 02:02.937
...and neither does he lets
his partner sleep.

02:05.300 --> 02:09.425
When the moon sets at midnight
with no one around.

02:09.854 --> 02:14.641
Just don't relent,
remain steadfast.

02:15.136 --> 02:19.331
When the moon sets at midnight
with no one around.

02:19.898 --> 02:24.377
Just don't relent,
remain steadfast.

02:24.798 --> 02:28.827
What if he pleads?
- Don't concede.

02:29.699 --> 02:33.551
What if he begs?
- Don't yield

02:33.870 --> 02:38.622
lf he goes for an aye...
- Go for a nay.

02:39.430 --> 02:43.840
lf he goes for a nay...
- Go for an aye.

02:44.923 --> 02:48.560
What if he puts me under
an oath of his life?

02:49.232 --> 02:53.711
When the moon sets at midnight
with no one around.

02:54.305 --> 02:58.609
Just don't relent,
remain steadfast.

02:59.138 --> 03:03.202
Don't accede to his pleadings.

03:04.107 --> 03:07.925
Don't give in even if he begs.

03:33.651 --> 03:38.273
Don't let him remove your ornamenets
or lift your veil.

03:38.725 --> 03:42.850
Snub him with your gaze.

03:43.590 --> 03:47.963
lf he tries to sweet talk
and convince you...

03:48.458 --> 03:51.753
...just shake your head
in the negative.

03:52.975 --> 03:57.799
The friends would try to
eavesdrop at the door...

03:58.224 --> 04:02.347
...having shed all their inhibitions
for the occasion.

04:07.922 --> 04:11.735
lf he pleads?
- Don't budge.

04:12.647 --> 04:16.772
lf he begs?
- Don't cave in.

04:39.827 --> 04:41.935
Don't puzzle me...

04:42.259 --> 04:44.309
it's after many a years,
O' friend...

04:44.762 --> 04:48.235
The night to stay awake has arrived.

04:49.559 --> 04:51.500
Always had this dream...

04:52.061 --> 04:54.111
...and after a long wait...

04:54.459 --> 04:58.204
...the night to turn it into
reality has arrived.

04:59.498 --> 05:03.943
Don't be envious at others' nuptials.

05:04.505 --> 05:08.082
Better get married yourself.

05:08.848 --> 05:12.735
Stop speculating and
jump in the fray.

05:13.958 --> 05:18.022
When the moon sets at midnight
with no one around.

05:18.684 --> 05:23.165
Just don't relent,
remain steadfast.

05:24.001 --> 05:27.747
Don't accede to his pleadings.

05:28.416 --> 05:32.539
Don't give in even if he begs.

05:58.375 --> 06:03.483
Place my dolls and
toys in the palanquin.

06:05.639 --> 06:11.126
Tell brother to bring me
all of granny's stories.

06:13.009 --> 06:16.610
The palanquin awaits me.

06:18.082 --> 06:21.482
The palanquin awaits me.

06:35.148 --> 06:39.212
l wish to take mother along.

06:39.944 --> 06:44.424
Send my friends with me.

06:44.915 --> 06:49.286
O' father, your daughter
has never gone alone.

06:49.676 --> 06:53.386
Your daughter has never come alone.

06:54.889 --> 06:59.014
The palanquin awaits me.

06:59.512 --> 07:02.700
The palanquin awaits me.

07:04.516 --> 07:08.855
The palanquin awaits me.

07:09.487 --> 07:12.580
The palanquin awaits me.

07:53.661 --> 07:57.336
Fruits... flowers... rosewater...'

07:58.772 --> 08:00.050
...rosewater...'

08:16.149 --> 08:19.787
Fruits... flowers... rosewater...'

08:30.261 --> 08:32.311
Give it. Give it to me.

08:33.806 --> 08:35.854
Give it to me it might fall.

08:50.177 --> 08:53.576
Fruits... flowers... rosewater...'

08:54.658 --> 08:58.024
lt is burning hot.
You want to continue travelling?

08:58.830 --> 09:01.567
Our halting now would mean
reaching home late in the night.

09:02.131 --> 09:06.434
Yeah, sure! And continuing like this
we may never reach home...

09:07.658 --> 09:09.209
Keep quiet, Kanwar.

09:09.604 --> 09:12.757
Might as well eat something,
Bhanwar and take some rest.

09:13.150 --> 09:15.129
Yes. Aunt's right.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.207
Let's proceed after lunch, brother.

09:17.668 --> 09:20.168
You'll always talk about
spending money, Kanwarlal.

09:20.378 --> 09:21.314
Banwari!

09:21.804 --> 09:25.275
Yes, stop it! Stop!
Stop the carts!

09:40.538 --> 09:44.601
Uncle says 128 ghosts reside here!
He is saying not to stop here.

09:44.952 --> 09:49.538
Hand him a pipe and
all the ghosts will vanish.

09:50.233 --> 09:53.979
C'mon, fast.
Keep everything there.

09:54.336 --> 09:56.386
C'mon, hurry up.
What are you doing there?

09:59.235 --> 10:03.988
Was it necessary to halt here?

10:05.180 --> 10:07.538
C'mon. Come along.

10:12.270 --> 10:14.319
Go, daughter-in-law, freshen up.

10:15.468 --> 10:17.090
Let's go, Kamli.

10:30.517 --> 10:33.146
- What are you looking at?
- You are completely okay.

10:33.644 --> 10:36.239
Rakma fooled me saying that
you are squint-eyed.

10:48.242 --> 10:51.334
As if this crow was waiting for us!
Come, let's go and clean it fast.

11:14.309 --> 11:16.359
Seems he too has gone crazy.

11:37.180 --> 11:39.229
Wow! So beautiful!

11:39.889 --> 11:41.940
Shh... it might fly away.

11:43.158 --> 11:43.466
Kamli!

11:49.830 --> 11:51.880
Stuck at one spot? Massage here too.

11:52.820 --> 11:56.255
- Fruits... flowers...'
- What are you doing, brother?

11:56.468 --> 11:58.578
Oh, you messed it up.

12:02.205 --> 12:04.940
Fruits... flowers... rosewater...'

12:05.400 --> 12:07.902
- Sweets!
- l've already added that.

13:41.607 --> 13:43.857
- What happened? Why are you running?
- Where were you?

13:44.247 --> 13:46.297
l was... but what happened?

14:02.391 --> 14:04.442
C'mon, child, eat fast.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.351
Oh! Going now!'

14:54.768 --> 14:56.569
Will be out of sight forever'

14:56.784 --> 14:59.212
Who? Talking about the marriage party?

14:59.669 --> 15:01.884
lt was supposed to go.

15:02.137 --> 15:07.031
No, dear, he means the bride and
not the marriage party'

15:07.591 --> 15:08.801
l see.'

15:09.469 --> 15:12.421
Was she a moon during the day or the
sun spreading its light in the night?'

15:14.440 --> 15:16.241
l've seen many a beautiful faces.'

15:16.456 --> 15:19.027
But she was exceptional!
Her beauty was unparalleled.'

15:19.758 --> 15:21.311
But, she's going away.'

15:21.531 --> 15:24.231
What will l do if she goes away?
How will l be able to see her again?'

15:24.936 --> 15:28.752
l have always seen a ghost
entering a human being.

15:29.282 --> 15:31.531
How come the situation
has reversed today?

15:31.748 --> 15:36.193
Despite being a ghost he is talking
all nonsense like a human being.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.071
Take care of him, dear.

15:38.560 --> 15:42.518
This is going to change
all the equations.'

15:42.975 --> 15:44.670
Neither the sun nor
the moon will rise.'

15:45.061 --> 15:46.754
The rivers and the seas will dry up.'

15:47.145 --> 15:49.610
Lo, he has turned into a poet as well.

15:50.621 --> 15:52.672
l won't be able to live without her.'

15:54.132 --> 15:56.038
l won't be able to live.'

16:13.387 --> 16:14.393
Kamli!

17:21.090 --> 17:23.237
Brother... here, have some.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.181
No thanks. Better you only eat.

17:29.259 --> 17:31.795
And listen, Anusuya...
don't repeat it again.

17:32.493 --> 17:34.080
Good that father didn't spot you.

17:34.474 --> 17:36.866
Had he done so, he would have
been very upset with you.

17:40.069 --> 17:41.383
Eating berries, huh!

18:23.445 --> 18:25.032
Bless you, son!

18:25.564 --> 18:27.543
Wish you an everlasting wedded life!

18:39.746 --> 18:41.617
Bless you, brother-in-law!

18:41.898 --> 18:43.878
l wish eternal bliss
to the lovely couple!

18:45.653 --> 18:46.662
Come.

19:13.388 --> 19:14.939
Rose water...'

19:15.926 --> 19:18.556
Flowers and fruits are also done.'

19:19.993 --> 19:21.165
Turban...'

19:23.815 --> 19:30.025
lf we multiply two by
sixty or seventy five rather...'

19:31.113 --> 19:33.163
...still it doesn't reconcile...'

19:34.242 --> 19:36.708
Rosewater is here, even the turban...'

19:37.370 --> 19:39.419
...flowers, fruits...'

19:40.498 --> 19:42.193
...no it is rosewater, flowers... fruits...'

19:42.652 --> 19:45.675
- lt's so humid tonight, isn't it?
- What?

19:46.790 --> 19:47.796
Yeah

19:49.813 --> 19:52.136
- Should l open the window?
- What?

19:52.942 --> 19:54.992
Yeah.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.333
Won't you take off my veil?

20:08.582 --> 20:09.590
Oh!

20:33.607 --> 20:35.373
Why are you staring at me like this?

20:35.901 --> 20:38.079
- Coconut!
- What?

20:38.819 --> 20:43.407
Yes, l forgot to add the money
paid for buying coconuts.

20:46.186 --> 20:47.466
Listen...

20:48.586 --> 20:51.680
You were busy with the accounts
while on our way, and the same here?

20:53.418 --> 20:55.988
- ls this any time for accounts?
- Hey!

20:56.544 --> 20:59.212
Business and accounts are the foremost
duties of a trader.

21:00.057 --> 21:02.106
The marriage accounts
weren't tallying.

21:02.454 --> 21:05.191
My father can never
tolerate such blunders.

21:07.041 --> 21:09.021
One... Two...

21:09.440 --> 21:11.798
So you are scared of your father,
that's why you are tallying accounts?

21:14.271 --> 21:16.322
Enough of it now.

21:16.878 --> 21:19.447
Do the rest in the morning.

21:19.658 --> 21:20.902
No way.

21:21.569 --> 21:23.786
l am leaving town tomorrow morning.

21:25.393 --> 21:26.744
Leaving?

21:29.286 --> 21:31.952
- For what?
- For business what else?

21:33.040 --> 21:35.091
l'll leave early in the morning.

21:36.897 --> 21:37.903
Tomorrow!?

21:38.531 --> 21:41.340
You know it is one of the
most auspicious day tomorrow...

21:42.424 --> 21:45.966
which arrives only
once in seven years.

21:47.637 --> 21:49.688
The business will flourish.

21:50.765 --> 21:54.130
But l'd heard that this mansion
is filled with loads of wealth.

21:55.908 --> 21:57.959
Without a doubt.

21:58.343 --> 22:00.393
Diamonds, pearls,
precious jewels and what not...

22:01.122 --> 22:05.246
But it feels good only when the wealth
multiplies with each passing day.

22:06.407 --> 22:08.386
My father says...

22:09.463 --> 22:11.513
only wealth matters.

22:13.391 --> 22:17.172
Moreover it's just a matter
of five years.

22:20.307 --> 22:22.108
They will pass away in a snap...

22:22.324 --> 22:24.196
in a snap...

22:25.243 --> 22:27.292
they will just fly away.

22:32.959 --> 22:35.008
l too will accompany you.

22:35.531 --> 22:38.197
Will l do business there
or look after you

22:38.729 --> 22:40.221
These accounts...

22:41.788 --> 22:44.180
Will you leave me behind, all alone?

22:49.156 --> 22:51.584
Why alone?
Everyone's there in the house.

22:52.562 --> 22:54.541
There is no dearth of anything
in this house...

22:55.272 --> 22:57.773
l mean, eat the best of delicacies...

22:58.089 --> 22:59.580
wear silk and satin...

22:59.790 --> 23:02.184
serve and take care of mother
and father.

23:02.675 --> 23:06.456
And five years will pass in a snap...

23:07.783 --> 23:11.327
Pass in a blink. Hmm!

23:13.346 --> 23:17.682
Rather l would be the one staying
all alone in a new place.

23:24.224 --> 23:26.273
Hey, you... are crying?

23:28.430 --> 23:29.982
Don't cry.

23:30.411 --> 23:33.362
Come with me. Come.

23:35.658 --> 23:36.666
Listen...

23:36.980 --> 23:38.603
Listen to me... listen...

23:39.065 --> 23:41.114
Time will just fly by.

23:41.810 --> 23:46.006
And then it would be
this very mansion...

23:47.407 --> 23:50.143
everything would be the same
and we will be together again.

23:53.385 --> 23:55.292
Go to sleep, now.

23:55.748 --> 23:57.275
Go to sleep.

23:57.763 --> 23:59.813
l will take some time.

24:02.283 --> 24:07.448
l have to submit the account books to
father before leaving in the morning.

24:09.234 --> 24:11.285
And the accounts are still pending.

24:15.490 --> 24:17.018
Where are you going?

24:17.227 --> 24:19.965
l'll sleep near the window after
reconciling the accounts.

24:22.788 --> 24:24.376
Mother said...

24:26.542 --> 24:28.592
Why ignite passion...

24:29.045 --> 24:31.094
for only one night.

24:32.867 --> 24:34.918
Better go to sleep.

24:40.305 --> 24:41.513
Sleep.

25:14.262 --> 25:15.269
La...

25:24.620 --> 25:25.794
Lachchi?

25:28.754 --> 25:30.450
lt's late!?

25:48.984 --> 25:52.350
No one knows the pain of a solitary
life better than l do.

25:55.518 --> 25:57.912
Don't lose heart like this.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.385
C'mon, go and refresh yourself.

26:02.399 --> 26:04.793
You have to see Kisna
off before sunrise.

26:05.875 --> 26:07.084
Right?

26:08.483 --> 26:09.490
Come.

26:37.677 --> 26:40.249
The pleasure of business is
the biggest of all pleasures.

26:40.562 --> 26:42.328
Rest everything is a big trap.

26:42.544 --> 26:45.457
Even the Lord Himself is
the greatest of businessman.

26:45.948 --> 26:48.580
He keeps a count of every breath.

26:49.321 --> 26:52.234
Be it the raindrops or
the movement of the winds...

26:52.796 --> 26:55.331
He maintains a perfect account of each
and every particle in this universe.

26:55.924 --> 26:58.662
When there is no mistake
in His accounts...

26:59.053 --> 27:01.682
...how can there be a mistake in the
merchant Bhanwarlal's account books?

27:03.501 --> 27:06.238
Kanwarlal... talking calculations

27:07.325 --> 27:08.674
Banwari!

27:09.757 --> 27:11.452
Distribute sweets in the village!

27:11.668 --> 27:14.583
For the first time in his life
Kanwarlal has talked sense.

27:17.750 --> 27:20.524
- Where are you going?
- To distribute sweets.

27:25.397 --> 27:27.791
ls it necessary for
brother Kishan to go?

27:30.263 --> 27:33.355
There is a reason for his going.
But the best part is...

27:33.668 --> 27:36.062
your brother will definitely
come back.

27:36.623 --> 27:39.610
- C'mon.
- Will l too be required to go someday?

27:44.860 --> 27:47.326
No, l will never let you go.

27:49.032 --> 27:50.381
Come now.

27:54.941 --> 27:55.948
Listen...

27:56.783 --> 28:00.455
get back ten times of what
you are taking with you.

28:02.587 --> 28:03.938
Sure, father.

28:15.376 --> 28:17.699
Only if you had gone
after a few days...

28:18.157 --> 28:19.853
He is going with everyone's knowledge.

28:20.244 --> 28:22.638
Your husband went away
without informing anyone...

28:23.025 --> 28:25.074
and hasn't come back ever since.
God knows...

28:25.455 --> 28:28.550
Enough. The auspicious moment
is passing away.

28:29.036 --> 28:31.665
And not in the next seven years
will it come again.

28:32.059 --> 28:33.966
l have seen all of them in my lifetime.

28:42.347 --> 28:44.398
Bless you with a long life, son!

28:47.805 --> 28:49.854
Wish you everlasting happiness!

28:59.587 --> 29:01.911
Where is your Bhabhi (sister-in-law).

29:03.515 --> 29:04.686
Listen!

29:07.163 --> 29:09.144
He is still an amateur in business.

29:10.223 --> 29:13.764
Stay with Kisna, always.
Don't ever leave him alone.

29:20.650 --> 29:22.698
Keep sending your news, Kisna.

29:33.161 --> 29:35.899
Don't cry... don't.

29:42.650 --> 29:46.678
He's the same fellow, right?
Lachchi's better-half.

29:47.098 --> 29:50.356
- Yes, the husband of that pretty one.
- He is the same.

29:50.887 --> 29:52.510
But, how come he's here?

29:52.973 --> 29:55.022
He has already left home while...

29:55.231 --> 29:57.447
...the fragrance of the bride's henna
is still fresh.

30:01.662 --> 30:03.426
Let me see what it's all about.

30:13.547 --> 30:14.555
Greetings!

30:15.147 --> 30:16.155
Greetings!

30:17.268 --> 30:19.377
This is a killing heat wave, isn't it?

30:20.011 --> 30:23.271
Yes... but where did you come from?
l didn't see you coming.

30:24.183 --> 30:27.276
Coming and going are beyond
human control, brother.

30:33.568 --> 30:35.962
Such a nice well.

30:36.347 --> 30:38.740
Whoever got it made indeed
did a very virtuous deed.

30:39.198 --> 30:41.249
My grandfather got it made.

30:41.667 --> 30:44.996
Oh! Pardon me, sir!
My humblest regards, sir!

30:45.385 --> 30:47.256
You seem to be new to the area...

30:47.540 --> 30:50.728
or else you must have definitely
known of sir's glorious lineage.

30:51.293 --> 30:55.772
The glory of Seth Bhanwarlal
of Navalgarh is all over.

30:56.507 --> 30:58.900
l feel blessed to have seen you
in person, sir.

31:01.163 --> 31:02.407
- Sir...
- Yes?

31:03.040 --> 31:05.091
Should l ask you something
if you don't mind?

31:05.891 --> 31:08.391
You seem to be just married.
What makes you leave so soon?

31:08.671 --> 31:10.471
Doesn't matter if you don't want to
disclose. Pardon me, sir... if...

31:10.652 --> 31:11.658
No, no.

31:12.146 --> 31:13.841
The turmeric tan can wait
to fade away...

31:14.232 --> 31:17.325
...but my father says that auspicious
moments are hard to come by.

31:17.741 --> 31:19.993
l am going for business.
For five years.

31:20.488 --> 31:22.111
Leaving behind the bride alone?

31:22.574 --> 31:24.789
Sir, you are wasting time
by talking to strangers...

31:25.007 --> 31:27.056
...will result in our getting
affected by the heatstroke.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.350
As it is we have to still cover
a lot of distance. Come, let's go.

31:29.560 --> 31:30.567
Very true!

31:30.915 --> 31:35.394
Fool, not even the divine treasures
can get the passing moment back.

31:35.885 --> 31:37.935
You still have time to
go back to your bride.

31:38.318 --> 31:40.605
When overflowing youth has
failed to stop him...

31:40.822 --> 31:42.871
...what will he listen to you, dear?

31:43.427 --> 31:47.552
Nincompoop! ls wealth meant
for man or vice-versa.

31:48.017 --> 31:51.725
Poor bride! She has to abide
by her husband's wishes.

31:52.117 --> 31:55.139
Yeah! The son abides by
his father's wishes...

31:55.592 --> 31:59.550
...and the father by
the 'wish of the wealth'!

32:01.917 --> 32:03.968
lt's a great idea!'

32:04.630 --> 32:10.980
l will take on the guise of Seth's
son to enter the mansion.'

32:11.580 --> 32:13.974
And there would be no one to question
me for the next five years.'

32:19.191 --> 32:22.284
Despite being a ghost
he has loved truly.

32:22.980 --> 32:25.029
His love is genuine.

32:35.874 --> 32:40.034
O' God... this is incomprehensible?
Stop him, dear.

32:40.359 --> 32:44.138
My dear, the storm of love
is stoppable by none.

32:45.224 --> 32:47.548
ldiot, wear the turban at least.

32:48.735 --> 32:50.048
That's better.

32:57.387 --> 33:01.097
Phutarmal... what am l seeing?

33:01.559 --> 33:05.340
- Sir...
- He seems like our Kisanlal.

33:06.077 --> 33:08.885
Yes, sir, he does look
like our Kisanlal.

33:09.310 --> 33:12.189
But what makes him
come back from midway?

33:12.821 --> 33:15.699
Phutarmal, a man becomes useless
after marriage.

33:16.156 --> 33:17.851
All hopes of increased earning
have gone kaput!

33:18.242 --> 33:20.908
One can either do business
or cozy up to his wife.

33:21.370 --> 33:23.348
Father... father...

33:23.733 --> 33:26.470
father, listen to me first.
- What the heck do you want me to hear?

33:27.036 --> 33:29.086
lf you didn't wish to go for business
just for the sake of your wife...

33:29.225 --> 33:31.274
why did you waste these three days,
you no-gooder!

33:31.762 --> 33:36.207
No, father... l came back
to ask you something.

33:36.942 --> 33:40.543
lf you don't wish, l will return
without entering the house.

33:41.493 --> 33:44.197
Tell me! What did you want to ask?!

33:47.367 --> 33:51.920
l happened to meet a sage on my way.

33:52.582 --> 33:56.160
Kishanlal, there isn't any dearth of
sages and ascetics in this country.

33:57.795 --> 33:59.490
You haven't come back
by losing money...

33:59.880 --> 34:01.576
to some deceitful disguised sage,
have you?

34:01.966 --> 34:04.015
No, no... father... father...

34:04.259 --> 34:06.510
- Listen to the whole thing.
- Hmm!

34:07.179 --> 34:09.679
He was seated in deep meditation.
Since ages, l suppose.

34:10.308 --> 34:12.357
His whole body was covered
with termites.

34:12.739 --> 34:15.476
l removed all that very gently
and carefully.

34:16.042 --> 34:18.612
Then l drew water from the well,
gave him a nice bath...

34:18.822 --> 34:20.801
fed him to his heart's content and
served him as best as l could.

34:21.012 --> 34:22.399
- Bless you.
- He said the same.

34:22.748 --> 34:25.380
- What?
- Bless you.' And he granted me a boon.

34:25.878 --> 34:28.509
The sage granted me a boon
that every morning...

34:29.005 --> 34:30.701
Hold it! Hold it!

34:32.134 --> 34:33.829
Phutarmal-ji, make a move now.

34:34.219 --> 34:35.915
He will go on and on with his tall tale.

34:36.306 --> 34:38.355
- Make a move!
- Sir!

34:41.170 --> 34:42.178
Boon!

34:42.944 --> 34:44.257
Are you crazy?!

34:44.647 --> 34:46.696
One should be selective
of the audience.

34:47.877 --> 34:50.866
Tell me, what boon did he grant you?

34:52.119 --> 34:54.690
Father, he granted me a boon
that every morning...

34:55.072 --> 34:57.121
the moment l get down from my bed...

34:59.244 --> 35:01.294
...l will get five gold coins.

35:07.586 --> 35:10.322
Well, l will abide by your orders!

35:12.798 --> 35:13.971
Where?!

35:15.440 --> 35:19.362
Child... stay here... and help your father.

35:20.097 --> 35:22.765
- Now go and take some rest.
- As you order, father.

35:23.226 --> 35:24.754
And, listen...

35:25.241 --> 35:28.950
this boon thing shouldn't fall
on a second ear.

35:29.447 --> 35:31.035
No way! No first... no second!

35:31.498 --> 35:32.849
And, listen...

35:33.583 --> 35:36.675
go to bed early.
You have to get up early, right?

35:39.839 --> 35:42.506
- And l forgot something, child.
- Now what, father?

35:49.015 --> 35:50.745
Bless you, my son!

36:04.134 --> 36:05.971
- Brother Kishan has come!
- What?

36:06.255 --> 36:07.949
Mother... Kishan Bhaiyya (brother)
has come!

36:08.132 --> 36:09.682
- Come, let's tell everyone.
- C'mon.

36:10.077 --> 36:12.577
So soon?

36:15.047 --> 36:17.511
What's the matter, Kisna?
You returned midway?

36:18.176 --> 36:20.046
ls everything alright?

36:37.116 --> 36:40.210
Came back so soon?

36:47.580 --> 36:49.238
My dear son!

36:54.287 --> 36:55.983
- Brother-in-law!
- Kisna!

36:56.200 --> 36:58.250
Draw a few buckets of water
from the well.

36:59.012 --> 37:01.548
Son, have a bath. The food will be
ready in the meanwhile.

37:04.298 --> 37:08.634
Burn slowly...

37:09.892 --> 37:10.000
...on the flame of life.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.921
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
...on the flame of life.

37:13.921 --> 37:15.452
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:15.452 --> 37:19.826
Burn slowly...
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:19.826 --> 37:20.911
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:20.911 --> 37:22.000
...on the flame of life.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:22.000 --> 37:25.033
...on the flame of life.

37:27.165 --> 37:29.146
lt's a fragile dream...

37:29.565 --> 37:31.614
...lest it may shatter.

37:32.309 --> 37:36.992
Be careful while you light the flame.

37:37.628 --> 37:41.657
Burn slowly...

37:43.084 --> 37:46.307
Burn slowly...

37:48.297 --> 37:52.078
Burn slowly...

37:54.208 --> 37:56.635
The imminent is inevitable.

37:56.952 --> 38:01.468
The sky never descends.

38:04.980 --> 38:09.389
Burn slowly...

38:10.543 --> 38:15.364
on the flame of life.

38:57.810 --> 39:06.047
All l wish is to live a few moments
in the grace of your beauty.

39:09.211 --> 39:16.950
The dreams l saw through your eyes
continue to live in my heart.

39:20.158 --> 39:27.697
But the edges of those dreams
pierce in my eyes.

39:30.862 --> 39:33.851
Burn slowly...

39:36.251 --> 39:40.374
Burn slowly...

39:41.464 --> 39:43.894
The imminent is inevitable.

39:44.246 --> 39:49.768
The sky never descends.

39:55.505 --> 40:00.187
Burn slowly...

40:01.274 --> 40:06.442
on the flame of life.

40:07.323 --> 40:12.217
Burn slowly...

40:13.440 --> 40:18.677
on the flame of life.

40:28.106 --> 40:31.058
A request will be needed even
today to lift the veil!

40:52.019 --> 40:54.757
You're looking at me as
if for the first time.

41:00.639 --> 41:04.763
Yeah, you were too engrossed in
the accounts to even look at me!

41:08.284 --> 41:09.529
This...

41:11.379 --> 41:13.430
This face... this beauty...

41:15.238 --> 41:17.287
hope it's not an illusion.

41:18.816 --> 41:21.589
There would be no one more
beautiful than you...

41:21.841 --> 41:25.134
and more fortunate than me,
in the whole world.

41:27.122 --> 41:29.968
So you have calculated
the fortunes of the whole world!

41:31.224 --> 41:32.918
l am speaking the truth.

41:33.309 --> 41:35.596
Why did you go in the first place,
by breaking my heart?

41:36.437 --> 41:38.239
l cried so much.

41:38.524 --> 41:41.852
You would have drowned in my tears.

41:42.346 --> 41:44.396
l have indeed drowned.

41:46.518 --> 41:48.568
See l pulled you back.

41:49.054 --> 41:52.276
l knew that you would
be back from midway.

41:54.859 --> 41:57.951
The stars in the night would have
never allowed you to proceed further.

42:01.184 --> 42:03.436
- Why did you go?
- Where did l go?

42:05.287 --> 42:07.335
l was very much near you.

42:07.718 --> 42:09.768
Having seen you...

42:10.151 --> 42:12.201
l never separated from you
even for a moment...

42:12.585 --> 42:14.634
and nor do l ever want to separate.

42:16.823 --> 42:21.233
Can one see anything else having
seen the depth of your eyes?

42:23.358 --> 42:28.431
Can one go anywhere after getting
mesmerised with your lips?

42:33.784 --> 42:35.728
My wish was granted.

42:39.206 --> 42:41.671
Who knows whether your wish
was granted or not.

42:43.099 --> 42:45.150
Get to know the facts first.

42:45.881 --> 42:47.929
l may be someone else.

42:48.696 --> 42:53.591
An imposter in the guise
of your husband.

43:10.905 --> 43:13.997
The same frame... the same form...

43:18.413 --> 43:21.813
...the same moustache and
the same voice.

43:23.486 --> 43:26.510
Yes, this new way of words,
this flowery language...

43:26.893 --> 43:29.285
...is something that l am hearing
for the first time.

43:32.801 --> 43:34.497
To tell you the truth...

43:34.888 --> 43:36.938
instead of a husband engrossed
in accounts and figures...

43:37.320 --> 43:40.614
l would love an imposter
spouse like you.

43:42.186 --> 43:44.165
l would adore him much more!

43:49.414 --> 43:50.967
No, Lachchi.

43:52.544 --> 43:54.273
l'm not your husband.

43:59.147 --> 44:01.434
You spotted that unique bird
near the well, didn't you?

44:03.317 --> 44:05.711
And the squirrel that
stopped you on your way.

44:08.358 --> 44:10.607
All that... was me.

44:16.595 --> 44:22.045
l'm an illusionist. A spirit.

44:25.214 --> 44:28.994
l can assume any form as
and when l wish.

44:38.421 --> 44:40.472
l am in love with you.

44:40.750 --> 44:43.109
And that made me take on your
husband's guise to meet you.

44:44.676 --> 44:46.655
But for my own revelation...

44:47.040 --> 44:49.779
no one would have known the reality
of this form of mine.

44:50.864 --> 44:54.643
Father is only concerned with
his five gold coins everyday.

44:57.502 --> 44:59.861
But had l not disclosed
this to you, Lachho...

45:02.403 --> 45:04.903
it would have been impossible
for me to even breath.

45:07.547 --> 45:09.596
l would have been suffocated.

45:14.846 --> 45:16.896
My love is yours, Lachho.

45:19.016 --> 45:21.066
My love is true.

45:21.797 --> 45:24.191
When you felt someone's
presence near the pond...

45:25.793 --> 45:28.009
and your lips started to
tremble just like this...

45:29.443 --> 45:33.117
l lost myself.
l was totally transformed.

45:34.655 --> 45:36.706
l tuned into a deep longing...

45:37.888 --> 45:40.175
to spend every moment with you...

45:41.261 --> 45:43.310
to be one with you.

45:45.153 --> 45:47.476
A longing to become one
with your breaths.

45:48.212 --> 45:51.753
You fool, what's the need to tell
all this to Lachchi?

45:52.313 --> 45:54.528
She would have unhesitatingly
made love with you...

45:54.745 --> 45:57.175
taking you to be her real husband.
- Just see the irony, dear.

45:57.910 --> 45:59.959
The man who took the marriage
vows with her...

46:00.166 --> 46:02.702
of being her spouse for seven lives
left her in less than seven hours even.

46:03.087 --> 46:06.868
And look at him. Despite being a ghost
he couldn't lie to her.

46:08.648 --> 46:11.456
Love has made him go
total nuts, my dear.

46:14.210 --> 46:16.259
What's the need to speak the truth?

46:16.989 --> 46:20.426
Deception and betrayal are
like second nature to men.

46:21.091 --> 46:24.111
Even the divine beings have sinned.

46:25.470 --> 46:29.394
But no woman would have
ever faced such a dilemma.

46:30.962 --> 46:32.940
Life is difficult without you, now.

46:33.707 --> 46:38.151
And death is impossible.

46:41.319 --> 46:43.713
But if it's not your wish...

46:45.212 --> 46:47.536
l will go back, this very moment.

46:50.216 --> 46:52.195
How could l live a dream?

46:53.832 --> 46:55.811
l am a ghost, after all.

47:01.095 --> 47:06.237
Just let me know of your wish, Lachchi.

47:28.865 --> 47:33.487
Never thought...

47:34.426 --> 47:42.722
of getting to live such a life.

47:50.865 --> 47:58.996
The eyes would be thirsty
for their own tears

48:13.978 --> 48:16.029
Don't cry, Lachchi.

48:16.483 --> 48:17.762
Don't.

48:24.545 --> 48:28.918
No one ever asked me my wish.

48:32.086 --> 48:34.137
And you happen to ask it today.

48:35.111 --> 48:38.547
Do you know how difficult
it is to answer?

48:49.188 --> 48:52.862
You are asking me to be yours,
of a stranger, on my own will.

48:57.702 --> 48:59.160
No, Lachchi.

49:00.831 --> 49:02.879
l don't want to hurt you.

49:08.129 --> 49:13.295
lnstead of putting you to
any pain... l would...

49:15.428 --> 49:17.479
prefer to go away.

49:34.891 --> 49:36.941
Couldn't stop the one who was going!

49:38.366 --> 49:40.832
How can l stop the one who
wants to come?

49:41.601 --> 49:46.114
Burn slowly...

49:47.022 --> 49:50.423
on the flame of life.

49:52.617 --> 49:57.097
Burn slowly...

49:58.178 --> 50:01.543
on the flame of life.

50:04.155 --> 50:06.407
lt's a fragile dream...

50:06.798 --> 50:08.847
...lest it may shatter.

50:09.578 --> 50:14.746
Be careful while you light the flame.

50:15.209 --> 50:19.272
Burn slowly...

51:23.608 --> 51:24.960
Wake up!

51:25.937 --> 51:27.668
Get up! Get up!

51:28.059 --> 51:30.310
- lt's dawn!
- So?

51:31.083 --> 51:33.581
Everybody would be waiting for you.
What will they say?

51:37.095 --> 51:39.487
When nature couldn't inhibit
us last night...

51:40.221 --> 51:42.960
what will mere words embarrass us now?
- C'mon.

51:45.714 --> 51:47.763
Who gets to hear such sweet 'come ons'.

51:56.904 --> 51:58.527
What are you doing?

51:58.990 --> 52:02.084
- You told me that you're a ghost?
- Top to bottom.

52:02.849 --> 52:05.799
You can't be a ghost.
Ghosts can't be tickled.

52:06.359 --> 52:09.939
Really? What more do you
know about ghosts?

52:10.531 --> 52:13.895
They don't feel the tickling sensation.
Their shadow doesn't fall on ground.

52:14.631 --> 52:16.088
Their feet...

52:16.717 --> 52:18.519
- Let me see your feet!
- Hey!

52:20.958 --> 52:23.978
But do you know that
the love of a spirit...

52:24.292 --> 52:26.343
showers along with the clouds.

52:27.144 --> 52:29.194
lt glows with stars...

52:30.305 --> 52:33.777
and rises time and again in
the form of the sun and the moon.

52:35.485 --> 52:38.921
lt spreads its light in the skies.

52:53.211 --> 52:55.603
What?
Sozzled early in the morning?

52:55.886 --> 52:59.074
- No, brother.
- But if Kisna returned midway...

52:59.467 --> 53:01.161
why did he not bring Mangilal along?

53:01.969 --> 53:04.291
Who'll take care of
the new business in Jamnagar?

53:04.679 --> 53:05.817
You?

53:06.695 --> 53:10.405
Brother, l heard Phutarmal talking
about some boon...

53:10.865 --> 53:13.401
You never tend to hear what
is useful, Kanwarlal!

53:13.994 --> 53:17.289
But you certainly hear all
the bubbling gossips.

53:18.305 --> 53:19.725
Hey, Banwari!

53:32.207 --> 53:34.801
- So, it is dawn finally for you.
- Yes, father.

53:39.158 --> 53:41.066
- What?
- You are...

53:42.146 --> 53:45.239
lnstead of smoking pot,
give some thought to work as well.

53:46.316 --> 53:49.754
- l was thinking.
- Don't think! Do it! Kanwarlal, do it!

53:50.489 --> 53:51.840
Hey, Banwari!

53:54.068 --> 53:57.055
You were supposed to give me something?

53:57.858 --> 54:00.181
- What, father?
- Are you in your senses?

54:00.914 --> 54:02.610
Forgot about the sage's words?

54:06.164 --> 54:08.795
- Oh, yeah! About that boon?
- Speak softly.

54:09.812 --> 54:13.736
About that boon? Father, l've kept
those coins long back.

54:14.401 --> 54:16.451
Kept them!? Where?

54:17.527 --> 54:20.158
You were fast asleep when l came
downstairs in the morning.

54:20.655 --> 54:22.707
You could have woken me up, dear!

54:23.855 --> 54:28.368
- But where did you keep them?
- ln your vestment's pocket.

54:30.807 --> 54:33.130
- Nothing is here.
- ln that inside pocket.

54:39.773 --> 54:41.823
Bless you with a long life, my son!

54:53.745 --> 54:55.025
Greetings, uncle!

54:55.239 --> 54:56.697
Listen, Kisna...

54:57.151 --> 54:59.887
there were some loud noises
on the terrace last night.

55:00.278 --> 55:03.371
Because of the heavy rains.

55:03.824 --> 55:05.447
Rain! Here!?

55:05.910 --> 55:08.125
Have you also started to smoke pot?

55:08.619 --> 55:10.315
No, uncle! No!

55:14.808 --> 55:15.814
Rain?

55:16.196 --> 55:18.590
Heavy showers? Banwari!

55:30.482 --> 55:31.691
Lachchi!

55:33.575 --> 55:34.582
Lachchi...

55:41.985 --> 55:46.324
To my dear wife...

55:54.985 --> 55:58.979
Humblest greetings to respected Father!

56:15.282 --> 56:18.305
- ls this any time to scare?
- What to do?

56:19.454 --> 56:21.434
At a time when one normally
feels frightful...

56:21.644 --> 56:23.693
you run out of your senses and
immerse in a ghost's embrace.

56:31.896 --> 56:33.519
Mother must be waiting downstairs.

56:33.981 --> 56:35.677
Trying to scare me by
mentioning mother's name?

56:36.068 --> 56:38.696
- As if you ever get scared.
- l do get scared, Lachchi.

56:42.323 --> 56:44.917
l'm scared of the moment when the one
with whom you took the wedding vows...

56:46.842 --> 56:49.234
will return and snatch my
Lachchi from me.

56:59.145 --> 57:01.811
Let tomorrow remain a mystery
in today's pursuit.

57:10.000 --> 57:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:26.047 --> 57:27.741
Easy! Easy! l'll fall!

57:30.217 --> 57:31.223
Sit.

57:32.302 --> 57:37.018
- Brother, it tears repeatedly.
- So what? l'll fix it in a snap...

57:38.905 --> 57:41.193
Where's the glue? Ghanshyam...
give me the glue.

57:41.687 --> 57:43.736
Give that to me and l'll fix it.

57:44.815 --> 57:46.864
C'mon, you also apply some.

57:57.396 --> 57:58.783
Greetings.

57:59.934 --> 58:01.143
Who is it?

58:01.603 --> 58:04.171
ls this the mansion of Bhanwarlal Seth?

58:04.625 --> 58:07.091
- Yes, it is. What brings you here?
- Brother, this...

58:08.797 --> 58:10.146
Kishan seth?

58:10.881 --> 58:13.974
Kishan seth? You? Here?
When did you reach here?

58:14.358 --> 58:16.053
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

58:16.373 --> 58:17.725
- Did you not recognise me?
- Well?

58:17.903 --> 58:19.288
- l'm Bhoja!
- Bhoj...

58:19.536 --> 58:21.194
From Jamnagar!

58:22.283 --> 58:24.676
You gave me this letter
to deliver at your place.

58:25.411 --> 58:27.460
On the third day of the lunar month.

58:28.538 --> 58:30.233
- But if you...
- Come in that corner... there.

58:30.624 --> 58:32.675
When you had to come here...

58:33.056 --> 58:36.314
Well it is, you were standing
with your back to the sun...

58:36.880 --> 58:38.575
so l couldn't recognise you
all of a sudden.

58:38.966 --> 58:40.423
- Bhoji...
- Bhoja!

58:40.704 --> 58:42.611
l mean... Bhoja...

58:43.586 --> 58:45.174
Greetings, sir.

58:45.497 --> 58:48.900
But when you were planning to come here
what was the need to send the letter?

58:49.601 --> 58:51.438
lnvestigate about me later...

58:51.650 --> 58:54.078
first tell me what took you so long?
- So long!?

58:55.439 --> 58:58.141
Of course it takes so much time
to reach here on foot.

58:58.359 --> 58:59.367
l see.

58:59.506 --> 59:01.863
You must have arrived on
some carriage for sure.

59:03.990 --> 59:06.621
Give me this letter!
And proceed on your work.

59:07.118 --> 59:09.712
l've got a lot of work to do and l am
sure you too have a lot to attend to.

59:10.246 --> 59:11.798
- Bhoja...
- Yes, sir.

59:12.332 --> 59:13.339
Go.

59:14.104 --> 59:15.905
- Should l go?
- What else?

59:16.085 --> 59:18.026
You want to sit on my head?
Go.

59:22.411 --> 59:26.534
Surprising! He didn't offer any
refreshments or food to a guest!

59:28.945 --> 59:30.995
Kishan seth, when are you coming back?

59:48.060 --> 59:50.109
What are you tearing?

59:50.841 --> 59:52.048
Nothing.

59:53.204 --> 59:55.420
Hey, just now there was a letter
in your hand.

59:55.743 --> 59:59.343
Banwari, it seems you are making
it too strong these days.

01:00:14.233 --> 01:00:16.934
You've come back?
l was waiting for you.

01:00:18.054 --> 01:00:20.414
Did father give any letter for me?

01:00:28.552 --> 01:00:31.394
Bhoja... why are you staring at me?

01:00:31.851 --> 01:00:33.901
Do you not recognise me?

01:00:38.492 --> 01:00:40.292
What are you doing?

01:00:41.862 --> 01:00:45.987
Sir, tell me first,
how could you reach here so fast?

01:00:46.278 --> 01:00:47.629
By flying?

01:00:50.585 --> 01:00:52.731
Flying? Me!?

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:58.155
- From where?
- Your village.

01:00:58.545 --> 01:01:00.596
- My village?
- Yes!

01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:01.917
No.

01:01:02.475 --> 01:01:04.867
l haven't stepped out of here
in the last six months.

01:01:05.148 --> 01:01:07.198
Sir... sir...

01:01:07.721 --> 01:01:10.317
l met you in Navalgarh on the
fourteenth day of the lunar month...

01:01:10.503 --> 01:01:12.055
at your mansion!

01:01:12.276 --> 01:01:14.774
Okay. Okay. Bhoja, enough of the jokes.

01:01:15.228 --> 01:01:18.322
Tell me, did father give you anything
else along with the letter?

01:01:18.774 --> 01:01:22.031
Sir, it is rather you who
are playing jokes on me.

01:01:22.527 --> 01:01:24.221
- Am l joking? l am joking?
- Yes.

01:01:24.717 --> 01:01:26.245
Oh, l see.

01:01:27.671 --> 01:01:30.764
Just see, l dealt with a drunkard.

01:01:31.181 --> 01:01:33.539
- Am l a drunkard?
- Yes, drunkard!

01:01:34.171 --> 01:01:35.629
Hold the stick!

01:01:36.673 --> 01:01:38.722
l handed his letter... to him...
in his own village...

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:40.835
for which he is slandering me.

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:42.858
lt is rightly said,
Do good and forget it'!

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:44.871
He must have never reached Navalgarh.

01:01:45.085 --> 01:01:47.548
Must have dropped after drinking
on the way. And lost my letter!

01:01:48.524 --> 01:01:50.919
l handed your own letter in your
very hands!

01:01:51.097 --> 01:01:52.898
- Did l or did l not?
- ln my hands!?

01:01:53.079 --> 01:01:54.878
- Did l not hand it to you?
- Let go of my hand.

01:01:55.162 --> 01:01:57.342
l just fail to understand
this obsession of...

01:01:57.909 --> 01:02:03.182
dispatching a letter to self and
receiving it by self at the other end.

01:02:03.504 --> 01:02:05.270
No, brother... what obsession!?

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:07.878
Brothers, shedding tears in front
of a blind man is useless.

01:02:08.093 --> 01:02:11.185
- lt will only make you lose your eyes.
- Am l blind? You are calling me blind?

01:02:11.741 --> 01:02:15.108
15 days to go there!
15 days to come here!

01:02:15.739 --> 01:02:19.318
My throat had run dry and
you didn't offer me water even.

01:02:19.804 --> 01:02:22.128
How could l offer him water?
Was l here or was l there?

01:02:22.517 --> 01:02:26.368
This is what l too want to ask.
Were you here or were you there?

01:02:26.688 --> 01:02:28.381
lf you are here than who was that?

01:02:28.598 --> 01:02:33.316
- And if you were there than who are you?
- Who am l!? He's asking me who l am.

01:02:33.535 --> 01:02:35.964
Just see brother...
everyone knows l am Kishanlal.

01:02:36.175 --> 01:02:37.183
- You're Kishanlal?
- Yes.

01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:39.154
Then he too is Kishanlal.
l am also Kishanlal.

01:02:39.303 --> 01:02:42.219
He is also Kishanlal and even he
is Kishanlal. All of us are Kishalal.

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:43.918
Happy?

01:02:49.001 --> 01:02:51.051
All are Kishanlal?

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:53.823
Yes, l have to go.

01:02:55.013 --> 01:02:56.957
Brother is coming to take me along.

01:02:59.428 --> 01:03:01.749
Leaving me alone!? Where? Why?

01:03:02.973 --> 01:03:04.252
What why?

01:03:05.684 --> 01:03:07.734
The third lunar day of these monsoons
would be the first after my wedding.

01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:10.995
And it is a tradition to celebrate
it at one's maternal home.

01:03:11.314 --> 01:03:13.638
No, no! l don't believe in such
meaningless traditions!

01:03:14.235 --> 01:03:16.770
And without asking me?
- But, mother has given her consent.

01:03:17.154 --> 01:03:18.847
How can mother...

01:03:19.274 --> 01:03:21.739
Let her say anything,
but how can you not ask me...

01:03:22.367 --> 01:03:24.061
Coming, mother!
- Again calling for mother!

01:03:24.452 --> 01:03:25.459
Hey!

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:09.866
Will you go leaving me behind?

01:04:10.886 --> 01:04:11.893
Coming.

01:04:16.517 --> 01:04:19.610
Say it then, you will never go
anywhere leaving me behind.

01:04:19.992 --> 01:04:22.208
l won't go... l will never go,
l will go no where.

01:04:30.802 --> 01:04:32.295
What happened, daughter-in-law?

01:04:32.539 --> 01:04:34.755
Whom are you talking to?
- Nothing, that...

01:05:08.233 --> 01:05:09.762
Sir...

01:05:10.703 --> 01:05:12.882
we have to visit Purabmal
early in the morning.

01:05:13.205 --> 01:05:15.254
Velvet and silk has arrived
from across the border.

01:05:15.881 --> 01:05:17.575
Better catch some sleep.

01:05:27.003 --> 01:05:28.875
Uncle Jeevraj, it has been 8 months...

01:05:29.088 --> 01:05:31.136
of the new bride arriving
in this house...

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.570
and you never visited even once.

01:05:33.884 --> 01:05:36.208
Greetings, Kisan.
- Greetings, Jeevraj kaka.

01:05:37.708 --> 01:05:39.757
So long no see!
Hope everything is fine.

01:05:40.175 --> 01:05:42.877
What to say? Forget about me.

01:05:43.269 --> 01:05:45.663
l have brought such beautiful
bangles for the new bride...

01:05:46.119 --> 01:05:48.441
that you won't stop looking at them.

01:05:50.671 --> 01:05:52.722
How do l look?

01:05:53.348 --> 01:05:55.740
Just like a pretty Doll.

01:05:57.066 --> 01:05:59.566
Buy some bangles for Bhabhi as well.
- No way.

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:02.072
These ordinary bangles
won't suit her.

01:06:02.732 --> 01:06:05.825
One would require the seven colours
of the rainbow to make bangles for her.

01:06:06.902 --> 01:06:07.910
Come.

01:06:08.988 --> 01:06:11.418
Bhabhi, special bangles are
being made for you.

01:06:23.585 --> 01:06:25.980
Come, Bhabhi, take as many bangles
as you wish to take.

01:06:39.781 --> 01:06:41.761
The bangles...

01:06:42.285 --> 01:06:44.679
Made from the colours of the rainbow!

01:06:46.733 --> 01:06:48.948
The bangles...

01:06:49.236 --> 01:06:51.287
Made from the colours of the rainbow.

01:06:51.668 --> 01:06:55.791
Their tinkling should echo
all over the house.

01:06:56.116 --> 01:06:59.968
Their tinkling should echo
all over the house.

01:07:01.053 --> 01:07:03.102
When the bangles tinkle
and the wristlets jingle...

01:07:03.312 --> 01:07:05.776
they should wake the beloved up.

01:07:06.266 --> 01:07:07.961
The bangles...

01:07:12.869 --> 01:07:14.920
When the bangles tinkle
and the wristlets jingle...

01:07:15.129 --> 01:07:17.701
...they should wake up the beloved.

01:07:18.015 --> 01:07:20.063
The bangles...

01:07:30.247 --> 01:07:32.642
The wristlets don't tinkle unwillingly.

01:07:34.419 --> 01:07:37.854
They don't chime without a plea.

01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:43.003
The bangles hum a tune.

01:07:43.733 --> 01:07:46.826
The wristlets don't
tinkle unwillingly.

01:07:48.948 --> 01:07:52.549
They don't chime without a plea.

01:07:53.812 --> 01:07:57.249
They pacify those who are annoyed.

01:08:17.444 --> 01:08:20.538
None of these shades please me.

01:08:21.827 --> 01:08:24.849
l don't like anything that
you have chosen.

01:08:26.866 --> 01:08:29.081
Bangles, made of glass are breakable.

01:08:29.612 --> 01:08:31.308
And those made from lac wither away.

01:08:31.732 --> 01:08:35.890
l would need the bangles
made from the iris.

01:08:36.388 --> 01:08:39.377
The iridescent bangles.

01:08:40.734 --> 01:08:44.656
Let me tie it from one end while
you take care of the other.

01:08:45.216 --> 01:08:49.934
And we will tie a swing of
the seven shades to colour the skies.

01:08:50.395 --> 01:08:52.444
The bangles...

01:08:57.696 --> 01:09:00.325
The wristlets don't tinkle unwillingly.

01:09:02.456 --> 01:09:06.343
They don't chime without a plea.

01:09:07.634 --> 01:09:11.700
They hum a sweet tune...

01:09:12.292 --> 01:09:15.894
to convince those who are upset.

01:09:22.129 --> 01:09:26.845
The drums...

01:09:29.011 --> 01:09:34.152
The drums...

01:09:35.752 --> 01:09:39.982
The dark night of separation
doesn't end.

01:09:40.826 --> 01:09:45.200
All the colours of life are lost
in this shade of separation.

01:09:48.022 --> 01:09:52.845
The drums...

01:09:57.405 --> 01:10:01.708
Only when l get to see my beloved...

01:10:02.272 --> 01:10:07.437
would l deck up in ivory bangles.

01:10:09.571 --> 01:10:13.693
All the colours of life are lost
in this shade of separation.

01:10:14.262 --> 01:10:19.264
The drums...

01:10:32.508 --> 01:10:36.633
The hurricanes swirl around like
bees over the vast desert expanse.

01:10:37.063 --> 01:10:40.806
Fill them your arms.

01:10:42.276 --> 01:10:46.401
l will get you the jewellery made
of flowers, if you so wish.

01:10:46.794 --> 01:10:50.717
Let the fragrance spread
from your embellishments.

01:10:51.278 --> 01:10:55.864
Those flowers would feel
like thorns to me.

01:10:56.421 --> 01:11:00.546
Let us weave a garland of pearls
made of the teardrops.

01:11:00.941 --> 01:11:03.333
Colour the pearls with
the colours of the iris.

01:11:03.719 --> 01:11:05.769
The bangles...

01:11:09.976 --> 01:11:13.412
The wristlets don't
tinkle unwillingly.

01:11:15.259 --> 01:11:19.325
They don't chime without a plea.

01:12:24.147 --> 01:12:26.326
lf you've come to seek something,
forget about getting it.

01:12:27.170 --> 01:12:28.697
Sir is in a horrible mood.

01:12:30.332 --> 01:12:32.240
Greetings, Sir.

01:12:32.384 --> 01:12:34.327
Our Ram Lakhan have grown up.

01:12:35.093 --> 01:12:36.586
Ram Lakhan!?

01:12:36.762 --> 01:12:39.014
Whose kids are they?
- Our camels', sir.

01:12:39.231 --> 01:12:40.926
They have grown up.

01:12:41.108 --> 01:12:43.157
So, what should l do?
- Sir...

01:12:43.922 --> 01:12:46.838
your permission is needed for their
participation in this year's race.

01:12:47.051 --> 01:12:49.966
ldiot, try at least to speak sense
first thing in the morning?

01:12:50.145 --> 01:12:52.194
Kisna suggested it, sir. Pardon me.

01:12:52.542 --> 01:12:54.378
But Chhote Malik (the younger master)
said that...

01:12:54.558 --> 01:12:56.217
Chhote Malik?

01:12:56.957 --> 01:12:59.351
He's still fast asleep, right?

01:12:59.736 --> 01:13:01.785
Well, he's expected any moment.

01:13:02.586 --> 01:13:04.209
What did he say?

01:13:04.603 --> 01:13:07.696
He said that our Ram and Lakhan run
faster than the wind.

01:13:07.904 --> 01:13:09.777
Let alone the experienced riders,
they will win this year's race...

01:13:09.954 --> 01:13:11.542
...with kids riding over their back.
- Yes.

01:13:11.902 --> 01:13:14.473
Sunderlal also took the responsibility
on the same premise.

01:13:17.183 --> 01:13:20.335
And went away after losing.

01:13:22.016 --> 01:13:25.937
He left even his young wife
and infant behind.

01:13:28.098 --> 01:13:29.935
lt's been seven years...

01:13:31.192 --> 01:13:32.885
of life filled with...

01:13:33.797 --> 01:13:36.192
the embarrassment of
losing the race...

01:13:37.483 --> 01:13:39.497
and the pain of separation
from my younger brother.

01:13:40.611 --> 01:13:42.162
You dare mention 'race' again and...

01:13:44.398 --> 01:13:46.971
You have decided to abstain from
attending rituals, is it?

01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.394
My respects.

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:51.831
Races, my foot!

01:13:55.868 --> 01:13:59.055
There is not a single camel in all
of nearby villages...

01:13:59.447 --> 01:14:01.319
that can match up to our
Ram and Lakhan.

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.495
Grant me an opportunity to...

01:14:05.705 --> 01:14:07.575
...get rid of the disgrace of loss.

01:14:09.702 --> 01:14:10.709
Father...

01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:13.310
only your blessings are needed now.

01:14:15.887 --> 01:14:17.474
And, yes...

01:14:22.804 --> 01:14:25.470
Who knows? Maybe uncle Sunder
might come back...

01:14:25.862 --> 01:14:27.913
after hearing the news of our
winning the race.

01:14:35.734 --> 01:14:36.764
Done!

01:14:38.375 --> 01:14:39.382
Done!

01:14:42.545 --> 01:14:44.596
Just see how time flies!

01:14:45.326 --> 01:14:47.376
Master will be mighty pleased with...

01:14:48.106 --> 01:14:50.322
the way you have made his
investments flourish.

01:14:51.443 --> 01:14:52.936
Father will...

01:14:54.364 --> 01:14:56.234
Two years, Mangi kaka!

01:14:56.586 --> 01:14:59.122
Sometimes l feel the family
has forgotten me.

01:14:59.645 --> 01:15:04.681
No letter, no message, nothing at all.

01:15:05.658 --> 01:15:07.459
lf the situation persists...

01:15:07.639 --> 01:15:10.070
l might end up forgetting even
the taste of my mother's food.

01:15:16.085 --> 01:15:18.196
Uncle...
- Yes?

01:15:18.449 --> 01:15:20.392
Better make a trip
to Navalgarh yourself.

01:15:20.569 --> 01:15:22.583
Bring atleast some news from there.

01:15:23.871 --> 01:15:26.229
Gone crazy? l will be killed!

01:15:26.826 --> 01:15:28.840
He will demand an explanation for
neglecting my duties...

01:15:29.015 --> 01:15:30.400
by leaving you alone.

01:15:31.968 --> 01:15:35.606
You can go on the pretext of handing
over all this money to him, can't you?

01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:37.867
lnstead of looking out for pretexts...

01:15:38.051 --> 01:15:40.302
might as well write to him
and take his permission.

01:15:40.519 --> 01:15:42.392
Then we both will go together.

01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:44.475
Yes.
- Yeah!

01:15:46.322 --> 01:15:48.123
Right away.

01:15:49.903 --> 01:15:52.819
Respected father...

01:16:07.038 --> 01:16:09.088
Just check who is there.

01:16:09.263 --> 01:16:12.355
Who is it?

01:16:28.933 --> 01:16:30.983
l heard you're going
to Shekhawati tomorrow.

01:16:31.890 --> 01:16:34.283
Got to dispatch this letter
to Navalgarh, to my home.

01:16:35.572 --> 01:16:37.586
lt's an important letter.

01:16:37.762 --> 01:16:39.670
Make no mistake this time around.

01:16:43.706 --> 01:16:46.442
We've kept the wheat bag inside.
- For you.

01:16:47.702 --> 01:16:51.139
And bring an immediate reply from sir.
- Here, take it.

01:16:53.785 --> 01:16:55.835
You didn't offer me water even,
last time.

01:16:57.401 --> 01:16:59.451
But how could l...
- Please leave now!

01:17:00.805 --> 01:17:02.429
Let's go, sir.

01:17:09.355 --> 01:17:11.571
What are you doing?!
Hey!

01:17:12.623 --> 01:17:14.045
What are you doing?!

01:17:14.222 --> 01:17:16.272
Neither will you go to Navalgarh,
nor will you deliver any letter...

01:17:16.655 --> 01:17:18.704
to anyone!
- Hey! Why?!

01:17:19.574 --> 01:17:22.169
After calling you a drunkard in front
of the whole community...

01:17:22.355 --> 01:17:24.429
who wants a bread earned out of
compromising our dignity?

01:17:27.602 --> 01:17:29.475
Wanted to ask something more, father.

01:17:29.861 --> 01:17:30.870
Sure, go ahead!

01:17:31.254 --> 01:17:34.854
With your kind permission,
l was thinking of constructing...

01:17:35.423 --> 01:17:37.473
a water well with a travellers'
inn adjacent to it...

01:17:37.647 --> 01:17:39.698
for the benefit of village folks.
- Shucks!

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.674
Sir, talking of spending money,
the first thing in the morning!?

01:17:43.034 --> 01:17:44.764
Seems the imprudence of
the whole world...

01:17:44.945 --> 01:17:46.853
has been ordained to my Krishnalal.

01:17:47.067 --> 01:17:49.117
Till date we are required to slog...

01:17:49.326 --> 01:17:51.019
to collect revenues from the villagers.

01:17:51.237 --> 01:17:54.151
And here this guy seems to have
totally lost his head.

01:17:54.748 --> 01:17:57.627
But you said that my coming back
has proved auspicious.

01:17:58.606 --> 01:18:00.406
The rates of silver have
risen sharply...

01:18:01.141 --> 01:18:02.837
and even the business is prospering,
isn't it?

01:18:03.019 --> 01:18:04.050
So?

01:18:05.661 --> 01:18:07.639
There's something l need
to tell you, father...

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:09.722
Good wishes and blessings of
the deprived souls...

01:18:09.901 --> 01:18:11.809
multiplies a hundred times.

01:18:11.988 --> 01:18:13.054
Phutarmal...

01:18:13.238 --> 01:18:15.287
How many hands would the Lord have?
- May be a 100.

01:18:15.531 --> 01:18:17.580
Here you are! When those 100 hands
of the Lord...

01:18:17.754 --> 01:18:19.627
couldn't do any good for the deprived
ones what difference are your two...

01:18:19.806 --> 01:18:22.236
hands going to make?
- Easy, father. Easy.

01:18:22.831 --> 01:18:24.323
Here!

01:18:31.833 --> 01:18:33.004
Very naughty.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.355
That you should be fondly remembered
even after the passage of a century...

01:18:37.915 --> 01:18:40.307
or more, that's why l'm insisting
on constructing a well, father.

01:18:43.683 --> 01:18:46.742
Moreover... you did promise that sage...

01:18:48.514 --> 01:18:50.565
that from the five coins everyday...

01:18:50.774 --> 01:18:52.824
What's this mention of five coins
every now and then?

01:18:53.103 --> 01:18:54.241
Keep quiet, Kanwarlal!

01:18:54.632 --> 01:18:56.647
And l am really pleased to hear about
your consent for the race.

01:18:56.855 --> 01:18:58.207
Did l give my consent?

01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:01.857
We will make both Ram and Lakhan
participate in the race.

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:03.422
One will have to win, anyhow.

01:19:03.634 --> 01:19:05.505
Kids, applause!

01:19:06.066 --> 01:19:07.487
All of you have united.

01:19:07.665 --> 01:19:10.131
Father, with your permission...?
- Go, son.

01:19:10.308 --> 01:19:12.215
You've got to construct the well. Go.

01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:16.731
But one will not find a single
spot in the village...

01:19:16.945 --> 01:19:18.961
where one can strike water.

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.247
Applause!

01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:23.165
This is the second time that
Mr. Kanwarlal has said something wise.

01:19:23.445 --> 01:19:25.281
Get some sweets for him.

01:19:34.428 --> 01:19:35.779
Uncle Kanwar...

01:19:36.722 --> 01:19:39.315
just trust me and say 'yes'.

01:19:40.649 --> 01:19:41.751
Yes.

01:19:45.237 --> 01:19:47.666
And father, l am sure
of striking water...

01:19:47.844 --> 01:19:49.751
at the spot that l have identified.

01:19:50.346 --> 01:19:52.183
Don't spend a single penny...

01:19:52.432 --> 01:19:55.133
if he doesn't get water.

01:20:00.704 --> 01:20:02.611
But striking water is certain.

01:20:03.970 --> 01:20:05.913
And we will win the race, for sure.

01:20:09.601 --> 01:20:10.000
Uncle Kanwar has agreed.
lsn't it, father?

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.581
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
Uncle Kanwar has agreed.
lsn't it, father?

01:20:11.581 --> 01:20:21.313
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:21.313 --> 01:20:22.000
Seems everyone has gone nuts.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.044
Seems everyone has gone nuts.

01:20:33.793 --> 01:20:37.122
Come along. We would have together
prayed for our wishes to be granted.

01:20:38.726 --> 01:20:40.777
Only if l had any wishes!

01:20:48.598 --> 01:20:51.549
Hope and faith lead
to fulfilment of vows.

01:20:52.456 --> 01:20:54.327
l've seen it happening.

01:20:58.643 --> 01:21:00.693
What's the need to ask God to compel
someone to return...

01:21:01.666 --> 01:21:06.312
when he had gone out of his
own free will.

01:21:11.605 --> 01:21:14.593
Better you go. For you, it's just
the beginning of life.

01:22:00.265 --> 01:22:02.207
lt's been two years of marriage.

01:22:03.671 --> 01:22:05.722
Be merciful on my dear daughter-in-law.

01:22:07.425 --> 01:22:10.019
And grant a suitable groom and
nice in-laws to this crazy...

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:12.598
daughter of mine.

01:22:21.571 --> 01:22:23.858
Grant everyone's wishes!
Make their dreams come true!

01:22:24.074 --> 01:22:27.674
The last camel race brought
a storm along with it.

01:22:29.286 --> 01:22:31.301
Clear all the fog this time around.

01:22:32.589 --> 01:22:34.638
Protect the prestige of my family!

01:22:53.859 --> 01:22:55.661
Look there, Kanwarlal is coming.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.311
ls he here as a mere spectator
or is he competing?

01:22:59.907 --> 01:23:02.442
Well, is a trader's camel
meant to compete?

01:23:05.851 --> 01:23:07.900
Don't worry. We'll handle it.

01:23:08.421 --> 01:23:10.781
Wait! Behold it from far.

01:23:11.169 --> 01:23:13.384
Let him see it to his
heart's content.

01:23:13.670 --> 01:23:15.292
Anyway, we are going to claim
it as a prize.

01:23:15.476 --> 01:23:17.526
The poor boy won't get a chance
to see it for another year.

01:23:18.119 --> 01:23:21.900
Have a nice look at it, dear.
- Hey... where is your uncle?

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:28.155
Look there!

01:23:33.099 --> 01:23:35.149
Kanwarlal is right.

01:23:35.496 --> 01:23:37.546
We should let Banwari and Phutarmal...

01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:40.667
ride the camels instead of them.
- But, Banwari and Phutarmal!?

01:23:41.231 --> 01:23:43.803
Keep quiet. You're not aware of
Hari Singh's guile.

01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:47.274
Your father had fallen prey to the same
deceit of his in the last race!

01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:49.565
But this time we won't
let that happen!

01:23:49.782 --> 01:23:51.618
You go!
You too move!

01:23:54.857 --> 01:23:56.313
Go back!

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:58.748
Both of you have to ride the camels!
- No!

01:23:58.957 --> 01:24:02.560
But...
- lt's a matter of the family's prestige.

01:24:04.242 --> 01:24:05.519
Greetings!
- Greetings!

01:24:05.734 --> 01:24:07.084
Bhanwarlal-ji

01:24:07.507 --> 01:24:10.730
Really glad to see you after
so many years.

01:24:12.617 --> 01:24:15.424
lt's not something trivial, friends.

01:24:16.509 --> 01:24:18.204
The lord and the master of a family
whose camel left the race midway...

01:24:18.595 --> 01:24:20.645
and whose own brother showed
his back to him...

01:24:21.722 --> 01:24:23.701
needs real courage to participate
again in such a event.

01:24:23.911 --> 01:24:25.784
Courage! lsn't it?

01:24:34.791 --> 01:24:37.256
Here, Lajju... go and put
this necklace...

01:24:37.434 --> 01:24:39.826
around Arjun's neck even
before he wins.

01:24:40.003 --> 01:24:42.078
And whisper this in his ear that after
being victorious...

01:24:42.507 --> 01:24:44.272
he will get another
magnificent reward.

01:24:44.732 --> 01:24:46.781
A pearl necklace in the camel's neck.

01:24:47.234 --> 01:24:49.769
Arjun isn't a camel.
He is like my son, rather.

01:24:50.502 --> 01:24:53.239
Arjun! We have got to win!

01:25:34.363 --> 01:25:35.015
Bless you, Arjun! Bravo, my child!

01:25:58.728 --> 01:26:00.601
Banwari, c'mon! Banwari, c'mon!

01:26:02.307 --> 01:26:03.728
Phutarmal, buck up!

01:26:36.472 --> 01:26:37.717
Turn, Banwari!

01:26:40.365 --> 01:26:41.718
Banwari! Turn!

01:26:41.965 --> 01:26:45.887
Banwari... turn back or else l'll
make life difficult for you!

01:26:46.935 --> 01:26:47.965
Run!

01:26:55.033 --> 01:26:56.136
Run!

01:26:59.654 --> 01:27:02.048
C'mon, Banwari... buck up! Keep going!

01:27:19.222 --> 01:27:21.333
BANWARl!!!

01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:18.098
Phutarmal!

01:28:45.175 --> 01:28:46.703
They fell off!

01:29:01.963 --> 01:29:03.905
What's happened to them all
of a sudden?

01:29:08.427 --> 01:29:10.477
Come! Come, Banwari!

01:29:32.825 --> 01:29:35.112
They were running so well!
Don't know what went wrong?

01:29:41.515 --> 01:29:43.457
l'll see to it!

01:29:46.623 --> 01:29:48.673
Run, Arjun! Arjun, run!

01:29:49.857 --> 01:29:51.907
Keep going.

01:30:01.569 --> 01:30:02.575
Keep going.

01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:52.196
How dare the Thakurs hit Kisna
despite you all being there?!

01:30:52.938 --> 01:30:55.675
Sister, we were busy celebrating
when they took advantage...

01:30:58.187 --> 01:31:01.065
You quietly endured it then.
What's the use of screaming now?

01:31:01.871 --> 01:31:03.672
lt's not a serious injury anyway.

01:31:03.852 --> 01:31:06.803
But l just don't understand what
Kisna's fault was?

01:31:11.706 --> 01:31:14.621
Hey! lnstead of congratulating me
for victory, you are scolding me?

01:31:19.819 --> 01:31:21.586
Listen... listen... listen...

01:31:22.184 --> 01:31:25.240
lnstead of nursing my wounds
you are snubbing me.

01:31:26.979 --> 01:31:29.030
Give me the reason of your silence,
at least.

01:31:29.274 --> 01:31:32.367
l thought you too would be happy
with our winning the race.

01:31:33.235 --> 01:31:35.285
Ok, it was my mistake, forgive me.

01:31:36.398 --> 01:31:38.271
Want me to do sit-ups?

01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:41.396
l won't spare those Thakurs!

01:31:41.542 --> 01:31:42.964
Lachho... Lachho!

01:31:43.176 --> 01:31:46.613
What was the need to show your spells?
l have totally forgotten that...

01:31:47.868 --> 01:31:49.741
Please don't remind me that
you are a ghost

01:31:50.335 --> 01:31:52.871
Don't do any such thing which
might remind me...

01:31:53.604 --> 01:31:55.476
of you not being a human.

01:31:56.175 --> 01:31:58.083
What if everyone gets to know of it?

01:31:58.955 --> 01:32:01.206
You know everyone was discussing this...

01:32:01.492 --> 01:32:03.472
that there was some witchcraft
during the race.

01:32:08.825 --> 01:32:11.112
Lachho, let people talk anything
they wish to.

01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:14.075
But they can never prove it.

01:32:14.804 --> 01:32:16.499
Sit down.

01:32:16.889 --> 01:32:18.940
And see the 'Turban' is back
in the mansion.

01:32:22.173 --> 01:32:25.466
What if we had pay for it
with our relationship?

01:32:28.569 --> 01:32:31.033
Please don't do any such thing.
You are under my oath!

01:32:32.217 --> 01:32:33.982
Under an oath of my love.

01:32:39.343 --> 01:32:40.763
No, Lachho.

01:32:47.164 --> 01:32:49.105
l won't do it.

01:32:49.421 --> 01:32:51.188
l'll never do it.

01:33:09.302 --> 01:33:11.352
This is the punishment
to make me cry.

01:33:13.854 --> 01:33:15.169
What are you doing?

01:33:15.348 --> 01:33:17.399
And this is the punishment
of loving me so much.

01:33:19.104 --> 01:33:20.384
Lachho!

01:33:51.253 --> 01:33:54.026
Where are you lost, Seth-ji?
ln your wife's memory?

01:33:58.586 --> 01:34:00.980
Tomorrow or the day after...

01:34:01.576 --> 01:34:03.625
send in some berries while passing by.
- What?

01:34:05.676 --> 01:34:07.371
Mangi kaka likes them.

01:34:08.493 --> 01:34:10.543
Here... l'll keep them right away.

01:34:13.045 --> 01:34:16.625
Okay... here you account is settled.

01:34:17.147 --> 01:34:19.054
Manager, just wait.

01:34:26.601 --> 01:34:28.436
They are so nice, aren't they?

01:34:28.615 --> 01:34:30.594
Get me a handful.

01:34:31.361 --> 01:34:32.606
Berries?

01:34:32.787 --> 01:34:34.836
ls this something worth eating?

01:34:35.359 --> 01:34:37.408
lt's meant for animals.

01:34:55.412 --> 01:35:01.385
The eyes are blank without you.

01:35:01.564 --> 01:35:05.559
Where are you lost?

01:35:07.126 --> 01:35:12.849
The eyes are blank without you.

01:35:13.382 --> 01:35:17.020
Where are you lost?

01:35:18.352 --> 01:35:22.239
ln those blanks of the eyes...

01:35:22.905 --> 01:35:31.142
burns a flickering flame of your
separation, all night long.

01:35:35.522 --> 01:35:41.459
The eyes are blank without you.

01:35:42.195 --> 01:35:45.630
Where are you lost?

01:36:27.899 --> 01:36:34.050
When the dusk sets in...

01:36:35.128 --> 01:36:43.080
shadows of your memories
start wandering.

01:36:44.651 --> 01:36:52.947
lt has been days that l have spoken
to the moon about you.

01:37:00.361 --> 01:37:09.499
Do you remember those berries?

01:37:13.187 --> 01:37:18.875
The eyes are blank without you.

01:37:19.408 --> 01:37:23.044
Where are you lost?

01:37:35.674 --> 01:37:37.748
Lachho! Lachho!

01:37:38.664 --> 01:37:40.713
Mother! Mother, look what's
wrong with Lachho!?

01:37:41.373 --> 01:37:43.424
Aunt!
- What's wrong!?

01:37:44.259 --> 01:37:45.917
What happened?
- Get aside, Kisan. Let us see.

01:37:46.136 --> 01:37:47.663
Get aside. Get aside.

01:37:48.046 --> 01:37:49.883
Sit... sit, Lachho.

01:37:50.272 --> 01:37:52.666
What happened, daughter-in-law?
- l felt giddy.

01:37:54.443 --> 01:37:57.737
What are you staring at, standing here?
Go and ask your father to distribute...

01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:00.001
sweets in the village.

01:38:00.559 --> 01:38:01.981
She is expecting.

01:38:02.158 --> 01:38:04.693
We will have to protect her
from the evil eye.

01:38:04.869 --> 01:38:07.820
Rakma, you are going to become an aunt
and l would be a granny now.

01:38:09.457 --> 01:38:11.993
ln what play of nature are you stuck?

01:38:12.167 --> 01:38:14.076
Don't worry.

01:38:14.253 --> 01:38:16.848
Celebrate, rather.
His life has been fruitful.

01:38:17.382 --> 01:38:19.432
Even if he isn't there
his lineage will continue.

01:38:20.022 --> 01:38:21.893
A lineage of their love.

01:38:22.107 --> 01:38:24.014
The seed of Lachchi's love...

01:38:24.262 --> 01:38:25.886
and the inheritance of
a spirit's affection.

01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:28.666
The legacy of Lachchi's beauty...
- Enough, dear.

01:38:29.441 --> 01:38:32.321
What when the real husband comes back?

01:38:33.056 --> 01:38:35.106
Just think what all will Lachhi
have to go through?

01:38:35.733 --> 01:38:39.725
And what will happen to the offspring?

01:38:44.630 --> 01:38:46.679
Send the news to her maternal home...

01:38:46.855 --> 01:38:48.406
along with the sweets.

01:38:48.626 --> 01:38:51.542
Only if he could have his way,
he would go flying away...

01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:53.628
to deliver the news.

01:38:57.872 --> 01:38:59.366
Come, inside.

01:38:59.576 --> 01:39:01.342
Let's go.
- C'mon, Lachchi.

01:39:05.379 --> 01:39:07.703
Where have l reached walking
alongside you!

01:39:10.488 --> 01:39:15.525
l too wonder the same.
Had l not been to the pond that day...

01:39:17.162 --> 01:39:19.210
how would l have spent
these many years.

01:39:20.115 --> 01:39:23.861
How else? By wearing silk...

01:39:24.079 --> 01:39:26.129
and relishing the delicacies.

01:39:26.512 --> 01:39:28.382
Yeah, you would have learnt accounts.

01:39:35.132 --> 01:39:37.074
l'm leading such a strange life.

01:39:38.258 --> 01:39:42.004
Maybe l'll never know
as to what you are to me.

01:39:43.369 --> 01:39:45.347
Do you know this relation of ours...

01:39:49.972 --> 01:39:51.667
ls unbreakable.

01:39:58.765 --> 01:40:00.292
What are you doing!?

01:40:04.673 --> 01:40:06.545
This image of yours...

01:40:07.628 --> 01:40:09.678
never crossed my mind.

01:40:10.963 --> 01:40:15.231
Only a woman makes a man complete.

01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:24.445
You are saying this because
you are a ghost.

01:40:26.535 --> 01:40:30.529
Had you been a human being, you would
have never said anything so nice.

01:40:53.784 --> 01:40:55.479
Sit for a while.
Should l ask for something more?

01:41:01.117 --> 01:41:03.132
From me?
- Yeah.

01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:07.298
Give me a daughter, if possible.

01:41:10.257 --> 01:41:12.166
l also need a daughter.

01:41:12.344 --> 01:41:14.394
As if a son would guarantee us
a place in the heaven.

01:41:15.402 --> 01:41:17.026
l agree.

01:41:17.417 --> 01:41:19.468
A daughter who brings
light in our lives.

01:41:23.395 --> 01:41:24.676
Ujariya.

01:41:24.855 --> 01:41:28.151
We will name her as 'Ujariya' (light).

01:41:30.105 --> 01:41:31.632
Ujariya?
- Yes.

01:41:33.197 --> 01:41:36.148
Ujaali (light).
- Ujaali!?

01:41:36.325 --> 01:41:37.877
Ujaali (light).

01:41:39.107 --> 01:41:42.400
That's fine as well.
Ujaali! Fine!

01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:46.050
The one whose glow would light up
all the directions.

01:41:46.788 --> 01:41:47.796
Ujaali!

01:41:49.115 --> 01:41:53.346
Kisan Bhaiyya... we have struck water!

01:41:53.913 --> 01:41:56.484
We have hit upon water!
At the same spot that you suggested!

01:41:56.727 --> 01:41:58.741
The whole village is blessed.

01:41:59.264 --> 01:42:01.693
As if the river 'Looni' has
sprung in the village.

01:42:03.436 --> 01:42:05.341
Let's go and tell everyone!

01:42:08.649 --> 01:42:10.557
Auspicious signs of our
daughter's arrival?

01:42:10.735 --> 01:42:11.741
Yes.

01:42:12.924 --> 01:42:15.422
Listen...
We will name our daughter 'Looni Ma.'

01:42:23.107 --> 01:42:24.635
Looni Ma?

01:42:40.381 --> 01:42:42.881
The water has sprung to life.

01:42:47.576 --> 01:42:50.111
The water is showering abound.

01:42:58.246 --> 01:43:00.262
The earth isn't barren anymore.

01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:02.622
lt is lush with greenery now.

01:43:02.904 --> 01:43:04.704
The vessels and the ponds
are filled.

01:43:04.884 --> 01:43:06.792
And so are the maiden's eyes.

01:43:07.074 --> 01:43:09.397
The water has sprung to life.

01:43:14.441 --> 01:43:17.216
The water is showering abound.

01:43:47.494 --> 01:43:53.289
The flowers bloom and
celebrate in joy.

01:43:55.872 --> 01:44:01.111
The bushes and the barren land
appear contended and cheerful.

01:44:03.691 --> 01:44:07.200
The water has sprung to life.

01:44:07.724 --> 01:44:11.361
A new moment has risen from
this perishable body.

01:44:11.963 --> 01:44:16.064
The future has taken birth from
the womb of time.

01:44:16.621 --> 01:44:19.713
The water has sprung to life!

01:44:20.548 --> 01:44:23.879
Another moment is born!

01:44:24.963 --> 01:44:28.563
lt has sprung to life at
an opportune time.

01:44:28.750 --> 01:44:31.181
The water has sprung to life.

01:44:36.085 --> 01:44:38.822
The water is showering abound.

01:44:49.362 --> 01:44:54.563
lt was a drop of dew resting
on your eyelashes.

01:44:57.217 --> 01:45:03.426
Not yours but it was a strange
dream of mine, sweetheart!

01:45:05.559 --> 01:45:09.160
Wake up from your dream as it
has turned to reality.

01:45:09.798 --> 01:45:13.341
The dream resting in your
eyes has come true.

01:45:13.587 --> 01:45:17.685
Time which rested in your eyes
has risen now.

01:45:18.173 --> 01:45:21.682
The dream has arisen!

01:45:22.450 --> 01:45:25.850
A moment is born!

01:45:26.585 --> 01:45:30.023
lt has sprung to life at
an opportune time.

01:45:30.617 --> 01:45:32.974
The water has sprung to life.

01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:40.269
The water is showering abound.

01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:45.133
Gone crazy?

01:45:45.388 --> 01:45:46.598
What are you talking?

01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:49.657
Pardon me, sir.
But your wife is expecting.

01:45:49.907 --> 01:45:51.399
She must have already
delivered by now.

01:45:51.609 --> 01:45:52.996
How can she deliver?
- Easy. Easy.

01:45:53.174 --> 01:45:55.154
What crap is he talking?
Take this fool away.

01:45:55.537 --> 01:45:56.545
C'mon! C'mon!

01:46:00.924 --> 01:46:03.839
May you have an abundance of life's
blessings under the shade...

01:46:04.053 --> 01:46:06.102
of the nurturing sky!

01:46:09.092 --> 01:46:14.615
And the house should forever echo
with the jingling of kids' toys.

01:46:16.946 --> 01:46:20.526
May your lap never remain empty!

01:46:20.874 --> 01:46:24.689
May your nuptials remain everlasting!

01:46:25.218 --> 01:46:29.213
May you enjoy matrimonial
bliss for eternity!

01:46:29.633 --> 01:46:33.034
The water has sprung to life.

01:46:33.629 --> 01:46:37.209
The fruits are bearing.

01:46:37.801 --> 01:46:41.723
For once it has struck the full moon!

01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:44.680
The fruits are bearing.

01:46:49.235 --> 01:46:52.328
The water has sprung to life.

01:47:28.753 --> 01:47:30.732
Hey! Who are you!?

01:47:33.202 --> 01:47:35.004
Kanwar kaka, who is he?

01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:36.914
Who are you?

01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:41.784
Father... l am your Kishan.
Who is he?

01:47:44.638 --> 01:47:45.951
Banwari!

01:47:47.521 --> 01:47:50.116
Banwari, call the midwife urgently.

01:47:51.310 --> 01:47:53.253
But there are still two months to go.

01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:54.849
Go, Banwari!

01:47:55.585 --> 01:47:59.781
Seems the child wants to take
birth in this very house.

01:48:00.069 --> 01:48:02.143
That's why even before leaving for
her maternal home...

01:48:02.327 --> 01:48:04.023
Aunt...
There's nothing to worry, child.

01:48:06.221 --> 01:48:08.272
The moment the midwife arrives,
everything will be fine...

01:48:08.653 --> 01:48:09.862
Aunt...

01:48:12.337 --> 01:48:14.388
Why are you looking at me
like that, aunt?

01:48:15.119 --> 01:48:17.690
l'm Kisna. Your Kisna.

01:48:23.042 --> 01:48:24.809
Aunt! Aunt!

01:48:26.936 --> 01:48:28.629
Go inside, sister.
Near the daughter-in-law.

01:48:28.812 --> 01:48:30.719
You go in.

01:48:31.488 --> 01:48:33.917
What drama is this?
Who are you?

01:48:34.234 --> 01:48:36.140
Where have you come from?
- l've come from Jamnagar, father!

01:48:36.319 --> 01:48:38.013
l'm your son!
- Shut up!

01:48:38.196 --> 01:48:40.104
And go away from here!
Come, son. Let's go in.

01:48:40.526 --> 01:48:41.556
Father!

01:48:41.742 --> 01:48:43.365
Father, l...

01:48:43.549 --> 01:48:45.314
l'm Kishan...

01:48:46.051 --> 01:48:47.603
How can you be Kishan?

01:48:47.789 --> 01:48:51.570
Uncle... l'm indeed Kishan.
- Even your manner of speaking...

01:48:51.752 --> 01:48:53.730
is the same.
- How else would it be?

01:49:23.971 --> 01:49:24.978
Mother...

01:49:25.152 --> 01:49:27.201
Even you fail to recognise the one
whom you have given birth.

01:49:28.245 --> 01:49:29.275
This...

01:49:31.930 --> 01:49:33.908
Mother, go and ask your
daughter-in-law...

01:49:34.466 --> 01:49:36.896
about the berry incident...
she'll tell you everything.

01:49:37.421 --> 01:49:40.514
These... l plucked them myself.

01:49:40.897 --> 01:49:42.590
Go and ask her at least.

01:49:42.773 --> 01:49:44.680
ls this any time to ask
about berries?

01:49:44.893 --> 01:49:47.323
She is fighting with death there
and he is talking about berries.

01:49:47.535 --> 01:49:49.027
What the heck!

01:49:49.238 --> 01:49:50.931
ls she an ignorant fool
to eat berries?

01:49:51.149 --> 01:49:53.720
And if you are Kisna, where is
Mangilal? Why didn't he come along?

01:49:54.104 --> 01:49:55.633
Answer him.

01:49:56.676 --> 01:49:58.584
Who would have taken care
of business at Jamnagar?

01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.668
You? l mean... you, uncle?

01:50:00.846 --> 01:50:01.854
Banwari!

01:50:02.862 --> 01:50:04.842
Kisna never retorts and here
you are, arguing with elders?

01:50:05.018 --> 01:50:06.855
Why don't you say anything, child?

01:50:07.971 --> 01:50:10.021
What's the need for my Kishanlal
to say anything?

01:50:11.066 --> 01:50:13.116
And you imposter!
lf your self respect is dear to you...

01:50:13.324 --> 01:50:15.895
better leave right away or else...
l said go!

01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:17.621
Father...
- Get lost.

01:50:18.016 --> 01:50:19.260
Mother... l am Kishan... mother.

01:50:19.441 --> 01:50:21.100
Get lost from here with your berries!
Just get out.

01:50:21.526 --> 01:50:23.706
lnstead of questioning that imposter,
you are questioning me.

01:50:25.315 --> 01:50:28.408
Father, look. Just have a look.
Here is your daughter-in-law's ring.

01:50:28.791 --> 01:50:30.841
How can it be with me?
- How do l know!?

01:50:31.051 --> 01:50:32.578
Then go and ask her, father!

01:50:32.787 --> 01:50:34.802
When we were returning after
the wedding, she had given...

01:50:34.977 --> 01:50:37.442
this ring to me.
Better ask her. What's the harm?

01:50:39.114 --> 01:50:41.055
O God! Two men with similar faces?

01:50:41.232 --> 01:50:42.689
lt's the bad omen of the Dark Age.

01:50:43.074 --> 01:50:45.090
What drama is this!?
- Shut up!

01:50:45.509 --> 01:50:47.559
This is our internal matter!
We'll settle it ourselves!

01:50:47.907 --> 01:50:49.955
No need for the villagers to poke
their nose in between.

01:50:50.929 --> 01:50:52.482
Whom should we trust!?

01:50:52.703 --> 01:50:54.646
Don't know who is right and who is not.

01:50:54.858 --> 01:50:56.554
He must have come in greed of wealth.

01:50:56.736 --> 01:50:58.121
Get lost, all of you!

01:50:58.333 --> 01:50:59.860
Kishanlal, go inside.
- Yes, father.

01:51:00.035 --> 01:51:02.288
Not you!
You go inside, Kishanlal!

01:51:04.103 --> 01:51:05.523
Didn't l ask you to go?

01:51:07.229 --> 01:51:11.082
Lachchi child, the midwife is saying...
- No!

01:51:11.576 --> 01:51:13.861
Listen, Lachchi... listen...

01:51:21.308 --> 01:51:24.850
What's the matter?
- The child's stuck inside!

01:51:25.895 --> 01:51:29.497
The midwife is advising an operation.

01:51:30.378 --> 01:51:32.972
Or it would endanger Lachchi's life.

01:51:37.921 --> 01:51:39.508
Let me meet her once.

01:51:39.693 --> 01:51:42.360
Uncle Kanwar, that thug has
entered our mansion...

01:51:42.578 --> 01:51:45.492
and you people are...
- He is worried about his wife.

01:51:45.672 --> 01:51:47.578
He isn't like you.

01:51:48.903 --> 01:51:51.119
Kanwarlal, there's no need
to explain anything to this imposter.

01:51:51.301 --> 01:51:53.281
Rakma... take them inside!

01:52:00.478 --> 01:52:01.485
Lachho...

01:52:03.396 --> 01:52:04.949
my Lachho...

01:52:08.124 --> 01:52:10.174
Never leave me.

01:52:13.962 --> 01:52:15.728
l take an oath on our Looni Ma...

01:52:17.543 --> 01:52:19.380
no power in the world can...

01:52:21.296 --> 01:52:23.203
separate me from you.

01:52:26.683 --> 01:52:28.589
From both of you.

01:52:44.063 --> 01:52:46.112
lf this precedent of having
two husbands is set...

01:52:46.285 --> 01:52:48.051
the traditions will go for a toss.

01:52:48.266 --> 01:52:50.317
lt might not be a big deal
for people like you...

01:52:50.527 --> 01:52:52.743
but life would become
miserable for the poor?

01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:58.482
The point is of justice, Bhanwar Seth.
Everything should be crystal clear.

01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:05.077
When does one get a chance to disgrace
the rich and the mighty?

01:53:05.472 --> 01:53:09.950
lt is something rare.

01:53:10.545 --> 01:53:13.567
Just see, everyone will start
talking relentlessly now.

01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:17.879
And that devil with the berries just
don't know what vengeance he holds.

01:53:18.434 --> 01:53:20.828
Ask the Seth to fill his
mouth with money.

01:53:21.042 --> 01:53:22.950
Or else things would go beyond control.

01:53:23.232 --> 01:53:25.518
No matter what power
the money possesses...

01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:27.606
it can never hire four shoulders
to carry the bier.

01:53:27.924 --> 01:53:29.974
Justice should be meted out.
- Yes

01:53:30.287 --> 01:53:32.303
Or the whole community
will be disgraced.

01:53:33.381 --> 01:53:35.074
No one knows who the real one is.

01:53:35.465 --> 01:53:37.160
One has to be proved a fake.

01:53:37.342 --> 01:53:40.638
Since that camel race,
l have been suspicious.

01:53:41.375 --> 01:53:42.868
What race, brother?

01:53:44.607 --> 01:53:46.894
What would you gain by disgracing me?

01:53:47.735 --> 01:53:49.087
We live like brothers.

01:53:49.299 --> 01:53:51.584
And we help each others
in times of need.

01:53:52.079 --> 01:53:54.129
Everyone has been benefited
because of my son.

01:53:54.338 --> 01:53:56.448
You are full of praises for his work.

01:53:56.980 --> 01:53:59.304
Father...
- This berry guy is the imposter.

01:53:59.519 --> 01:54:01.497
Kick him out of here!

01:54:03.236 --> 01:54:04.658
No, uncle...

01:54:04.836 --> 01:54:09.836
Trust me! l'm your Kishan!

01:54:12.655 --> 01:54:14.977
l am... Kishan!

01:54:29.790 --> 01:54:32.184
Congratulations, brother-in-law!

01:54:35.488 --> 01:54:37.919
lt's a girl.
The ladyluck has smiled on this house.

01:54:55.406 --> 01:54:57.799
Both the mother and the child are fine.

01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:10.767
Mother!

01:55:16.502 --> 01:55:19.525
What's the matter?
- Mother, father has come back.

01:55:20.812 --> 01:55:22.507
What!?
- Yes!

01:55:22.655 --> 01:55:24.420
And, sister Rakma was saying that...

01:55:47.714 --> 01:55:49.620
Come here, son!

01:55:50.807 --> 01:55:52.395
Come here!

01:56:01.547 --> 01:56:03.526
Forgive me if possible...

01:56:09.263 --> 01:56:11.171
Please forgive me.

01:56:13.432 --> 01:56:16.550
Come... come here...

01:56:36.651 --> 01:56:40.774
Sunder kaka, there is so much
to call our own.

01:56:41.690 --> 01:56:43.421
Don't lose them ever.

01:56:49.162 --> 01:56:55.242
The moments of life just slip by.

01:57:14.013 --> 01:57:16.063
This can't be settled without
the intervention of the King.

01:57:16.273 --> 01:57:18.038
Better produce them to the King.

01:57:18.567 --> 01:57:20.260
Yes, let the King decide.

01:57:20.477 --> 01:57:22.005
Yeah, sure.

01:57:23.501 --> 01:57:25.374
Kindly consider my plea.

01:57:26.387 --> 01:57:30.450
Allow me to see my daughter
before going.

01:57:31.913 --> 01:57:33.928
What's the hurry?

01:57:34.693 --> 01:57:37.572
Once the justice is imparted,
you have all the time to be with her.

01:57:37.752 --> 01:57:39.303
That's right!

01:58:23.074 --> 01:58:25.468
What's happening here...?

01:58:25.993 --> 01:58:29.631
Brother, only God knows what is
in store for me.

01:58:30.233 --> 01:58:33.813
But, you very well know that,
l am Seth Bhanwarlal's real son.

01:58:34.368 --> 01:58:36.418
So who are you after all?

01:58:37.532 --> 01:58:41.800
Real... unreal! Truth and untruth!
We have such hollow beliefs.

01:58:42.432 --> 01:58:44.482
Hey, what rubbish are you talking?

01:58:45.004 --> 01:58:47.885
Tell me the truth!
Did you marry her at the wedding altar?

01:58:48.099 --> 01:58:50.148
Did you take the seven marital vows?

01:58:51.922 --> 01:58:53.793
What difference do the vows make?

01:58:54.179 --> 01:58:56.752
The plea of marriage doesn't last
for the lifetime.

01:58:57.344 --> 01:58:59.322
What revenge are you seeking from me?

01:59:00.263 --> 01:59:02.313
For God's sake, tell me,
who you are?

01:59:04.329 --> 01:59:05.431
l?

01:59:06.172 --> 01:59:09.607
l am the yearning that resides in
a woman's heart... that's who l am.

01:59:11.385 --> 01:59:13.436
l'm the love she wants

01:59:14.721 --> 01:59:16.735
Love?
- Hey, keep going.

01:59:17.119 --> 01:59:19.169
Did you hear?
He said he is 'love.'

01:59:56.707 --> 01:59:58.756
Where are so many people heading to?

01:59:59.277 --> 02:00:01.850
For some feast?
- We are going to the King.

02:00:02.407 --> 02:00:03.758
To the King?
- Yes.

02:00:03.972 --> 02:00:05.912
For what?
- For justice!

02:00:06.855 --> 02:00:08.798
Justice!? What justice?

02:00:09.010 --> 02:00:11.061
What will you do with it?
You won't understand a bit of it.

02:00:11.790 --> 02:00:13.486
May be.

02:00:13.945 --> 02:00:16.410
But l might settle the issue
right here.

02:00:21.872 --> 02:00:25.935
O' King of kings...
kindly give way and let us go.

02:00:26.111 --> 02:00:27.663
Go, sirs!

02:00:27.919 --> 02:00:29.897
But isn't it possible that a needle
can pull off something...

02:00:30.073 --> 02:00:31.494
which the sword can't achieve?

02:00:36.746 --> 02:00:38.795
Look... look at both of them.
- Who?

02:00:39.630 --> 02:00:41.395
Get aside.

02:00:43.175 --> 02:00:45.047
Aren't they identical?

02:00:53.984 --> 02:00:55.477
O gosh!

02:01:00.032 --> 02:01:05.032
Aren't they identical?
- Of course, they are.

02:01:05.593 --> 02:01:09.030
Then who's the real one?
- What's the issue of the real...

02:01:09.209 --> 02:01:11.116
and the duplicate?
Must be twins.

02:01:12.196 --> 02:01:13.548
The justice is done.

02:01:13.761 --> 02:01:15.811
l mean what's the problem if they
are identical?

02:01:16.855 --> 02:01:19.000
The problem is, l have only one son.

02:01:19.496 --> 02:01:21.889
And my daughter-in-law too has
only one spouse.

02:01:22.414 --> 02:01:24.038
Such a petty issue...

02:01:24.222 --> 02:01:27.280
and none of you could solve
this problem?

02:01:27.873 --> 02:01:30.575
Everyone's set for a march
to the King's palace!

02:01:31.069 --> 02:01:32.349
What's this?

02:01:39.932 --> 02:01:44.756
Both look so similar as if they
are reflections in the mirror.

02:01:46.258 --> 02:01:47.536
Brother... brother...

02:01:49.873 --> 02:01:52.124
Are both of them dumb and deaf?
- Not at all.

02:01:52.341 --> 02:01:53.797
On the contrary, both have
a gift of the gab.

02:01:53.973 --> 02:01:56.023
Then just ask them
who the fake one is.

02:01:57.762 --> 02:01:59.705
Brother, we're done with this
nincompoop's justice.

02:02:00.092 --> 02:02:03.528
Kanwarlal... had he been so wise,
he wouldn't have been a shepherd.

02:02:04.608 --> 02:02:07.347
Got it! Got it!

02:02:07.912 --> 02:02:11.512
They know how to talk but they have
learnt the art of lying as well.

02:02:11.699 --> 02:02:13.606
No problem! No problem at all!
Hold this.

02:02:13.993 --> 02:02:16.210
lt's a piece of cake for me to get
the truth out! Get aside!

02:02:18.061 --> 02:02:20.689
l'll solve this riddle in a jiffy!

02:02:22.162 --> 02:02:24.035
What's he doing?

02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:41.756
The one who will hold this
burning coal on his palm...

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:45.131
with be the real son.

02:02:45.691 --> 02:02:49.544
This is... this is absolute
injustice, father!

02:02:52.017 --> 02:02:55.727
And you? Do you think you are
the revered saint Valmiki...

02:02:58.969 --> 02:03:00.875
that you are putting us
to a test of fire?

02:03:16.347 --> 02:03:18.597
Now let me see...

02:03:33.134 --> 02:03:34.235
Father!

02:03:34.420 --> 02:03:39.172
Father, let this shepherd say anything.
But l am your real son.

02:03:55.482 --> 02:03:57.283
Bravo, courageous boy!

02:03:58.055 --> 02:04:00.588
Who else can dare to do that
other than the real son!?

02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:05.107
These fools needlessly harassed you!

02:04:06.326 --> 02:04:09.962
But, sir, what matters is the
satisfaction of the heart, isn't it?

02:04:10.496 --> 02:04:14.491
Come... come, buddy...
let me put you to another test.

02:04:15.709 --> 02:04:18.304
Come... you also come.
Come and join him here.

02:04:20.473 --> 02:04:23.350
Look... before my seventh clap...

02:04:24.086 --> 02:04:26.136
the one who can gather all my sheep...

02:04:26.518 --> 02:04:28.569
is the real husband of the bride.

02:04:29.474 --> 02:04:30.647
Fine?
- Yes.

02:04:30.829 --> 02:04:32.214
Yes?
- Yes!

02:04:32.392 --> 02:04:34.466
Run! Hey, fell down.

02:04:34.687 --> 02:04:37.945
Move.
- Kishanlal... hurry up.

02:04:39.137 --> 02:04:40.486
Kishanlal!

02:04:45.253 --> 02:04:48.831
Listen, the test should be such
which a trader can face.

02:04:49.597 --> 02:04:51.956
What else would a trader know
but to calculate?

02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:55.432
Six... seven

02:04:56.721 --> 02:04:58.736
Caught.
- Well done.

02:05:00.024 --> 02:05:02.075
Who else can have this courage
and ability other than...

02:05:02.493 --> 02:05:04.472
the real husband?

02:05:05.967 --> 02:05:07.946
But why should there be even
an iota of doubt left?

02:05:08.122 --> 02:05:11.073
Let us put them to one more test.
The last and the final.

02:05:11.354 --> 02:05:13.332
Father...
- Keep it down here!

02:05:13.648 --> 02:05:15.591
The final test!

02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:34.704
Kanwarlal, this shepherd
is wasting our time.

02:05:34.919 --> 02:05:35.927
Yes!

02:05:37.249 --> 02:05:39.298
Before the seventh snap of the finger...

02:05:40.305 --> 02:05:42.451
the real husband of the bride...

02:05:43.574 --> 02:05:45.410
will enter into this waterbag!

02:05:46.736 --> 02:05:49.402
You shepherd, have you gone mad!?

02:05:49.968 --> 02:05:51.664
ln that water bag...

02:05:51.846 --> 02:05:52.877
Father...

02:05:53.828 --> 02:05:55.971
That one would be the real
lover of the bride.

02:06:10.371 --> 02:06:16.937
Never do anything that would remind
me of your not being a human being.'

02:06:17.948 --> 02:06:19.474
'Of not being a human being!'

02:06:20.066 --> 02:06:23.124
'You are under my oath!
Under the oath of my love!'

02:06:28.895 --> 02:06:30.946
l will have to break the oath, Lachho.

02:06:33.102 --> 02:06:35.116
lt's the test of my love!

02:06:37.376 --> 02:06:40.113
lt's a trial in front of the world!

02:06:44.189 --> 02:06:46.511
Wait, don't fall for this
shepherd's trap.

02:06:46.898 --> 02:06:50.158
Don't trust a human being.
- He is digging his own grave.

02:06:50.722 --> 02:06:53.293
You don't have any idea of how
deceitful human beings are.

02:06:53.502 --> 02:06:56.037
Listen to me...
- Don't do a thing like this!

02:07:37.782 --> 02:07:38.990
That's it.

02:07:39.173 --> 02:07:41.768
Justice was delayed indeed...

02:07:42.161 --> 02:07:43.856
but wasn't it fair?

02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:45.948
Got him!

02:07:46.541 --> 02:07:50.049
Father...
- May that ghost rot in hell.

02:07:50.399 --> 02:07:53.170
He covered my eyes with gold...

02:07:53.421 --> 02:07:56.302
and, Kanwarlal, l couldn't
even identify my own son!

02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:58.381
Bless you, my son!

02:08:01.207 --> 02:08:03.257
Come...
- Here... take it.

02:08:05.727 --> 02:08:07.776
And this...
- No, brother!

02:08:08.506 --> 02:08:11.421
l'm no king to seek a price
for imparting justice.

02:08:12.052 --> 02:08:14.446
You had a problem and l solved it.

02:08:14.694 --> 02:08:18.544
Keep it.
lt would help buy food for your cattle.

02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:20.811
Sir... come here...

02:08:22.618 --> 02:08:25.840
My cattle are real fools, just like me.
They merrily eat grass...

02:08:26.024 --> 02:08:27.576
but don't even sniff gold.

02:08:27.866 --> 02:08:30.366
These useless things are fit for
rich people like you.

02:08:31.168 --> 02:08:32.789
For me... my stick suits the best.

02:08:32.975 --> 02:08:34.882
Give it to me, buddy!

02:09:28.273 --> 02:09:34.245
The midnight moon...

02:09:35.502 --> 02:09:38.417
remembers everything.

02:09:41.096 --> 02:09:49.392
Despite being awake in the dreams...

02:09:52.011 --> 02:09:55.552
No doubt the face is one...

02:09:56.459 --> 02:09:59.552
But l call out for two names.

02:10:00.734 --> 02:10:09.030
All l get to speak is with
the sand-dunes.

02:10:15.123 --> 02:10:16.925
But why are you so worried?

02:10:18.218 --> 02:10:20.268
We were the ones who had
given him birth.

02:10:21.274 --> 02:10:23.182
When we couldn't identify him...

02:10:23.394 --> 02:10:25.267
how could you have possibly done so?

02:10:26.038 --> 02:10:27.696
For us...

02:10:27.949 --> 02:10:30.128
you're still the same daughter who...

02:10:30.521 --> 02:10:32.571
entered this house as
the daughter-in-law.

02:10:32.745 --> 02:10:34.653
Everything will be fine.

02:10:35.421 --> 02:10:37.778
You are not at fault, child.

02:10:38.410 --> 02:10:41.953
And it's not even the fault
of the newborn.

02:10:42.234 --> 02:10:47.683
The eyes are blank without you.

02:10:48.419 --> 02:10:52.543
Where are you lost?

02:10:56.517 --> 02:10:58.569
God only knows how many lives...

02:10:58.743 --> 02:11:00.650
l would be required to live.

02:11:06.145 --> 02:11:11.074
All l can pray for you is that...

02:11:12.297 --> 02:11:15.593
you get the strength to face
life and take your decisions.

02:12:04.293 --> 02:12:05.396
Lachchi...

02:12:08.532 --> 02:12:10.085
only l know...

02:12:11.556 --> 02:12:13.572
how l had spent these four years...

02:12:16.424 --> 02:12:18.473
and how every night
passed for me!

02:12:20.558 --> 02:12:22.431
And then just think...

02:12:23.131 --> 02:12:25.559
let me lift this veil...

02:12:27.301 --> 02:12:29.209
Thinking that...

02:12:31.334 --> 02:12:33.384
Before starting life
afresh with you...

02:12:35.156 --> 02:12:37.206
l've got to fulfill
an obligation.

02:12:41.205 --> 02:12:43.111
Want to tell you something.

02:12:43.532 --> 02:12:46.235
l know it! l know it!

02:12:47.565 --> 02:12:51.106
That wretch cast his spell...
- No!

02:12:52.638 --> 02:12:55.448
Neither did he cast any spell,
nor did he try to deceive me.

02:12:57.505 --> 02:12:59.554
He told me everything.

02:13:00.180 --> 02:13:02.052
The whole truth!

02:13:03.136 --> 02:13:06.915
l had faced that
moment of dilemma.

02:13:10.052 --> 02:13:13.489
l trusted his love and truthfulness...

02:13:13.667 --> 02:13:15.608
and consented for the relationship.

02:13:18.497 --> 02:13:22.384
The love... the respect that
l got from him...

02:13:24.509 --> 02:13:26.204
will be hard to forget.

02:13:30.071 --> 02:13:35.237
Now how can l start a new
life with you?

02:13:37.301 --> 02:13:39.066
How can l possibly love you?

02:13:41.715 --> 02:13:47.924
You left a part of your other
life, downstairs?

02:13:51.272 --> 02:13:53.323
Didn't bring Ujaali with you?

02:13:55.931 --> 02:13:57.481
Her name isn't Ujaali.

02:13:57.875 --> 02:14:04.028
l know it! l know it!
That we will address her as Looni Ma...

02:14:05.835 --> 02:14:07.671
is what we had decided...

02:14:09.624 --> 02:14:11.674
on the day when the water
was found, isn't it?

02:14:21.163 --> 02:14:22.786
Looni Ma...

02:14:23.977 --> 02:14:29.215
Wasn't this the decision
we both took?

02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:40.516
But everyone told me that...

02:14:40.695 --> 02:14:43.291
the shepherd captured the ghost
in the waterbag.

02:14:43.685 --> 02:14:44.692
Huh!

02:14:45.109 --> 02:14:47.158
l entered it with my own free will.

02:14:48.203 --> 02:14:50.490
Since l had to prove my love!

02:14:54.285 --> 02:14:57.721
lf the shepherd really had the power
to separate us...

02:14:59.813 --> 02:15:04.778
it was a child's play
for me to enter...

02:15:05.163 --> 02:15:13.459
your husband's body in order
to be with you all my life.

02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:19.375
Moreover, l had taken an oath
on my daughter...

02:15:22.332 --> 02:15:24.383
of not separating
from both of you.

02:15:32.065 --> 02:15:33.974
Now will we ever separate?

02:15:34.985 --> 02:15:36.053
Never!

02:15:37.974 --> 02:15:39.881
Never for a moment!

02:15:40.338 --> 02:15:43.004
l'll keep you tied to me, always.

02:15:48.748 --> 02:15:51.865
This way their love continued
to shower with the clouds.

02:15:52.572 --> 02:15:54.621
Kept sparkling with the stars.

02:15:55.038 --> 02:15:58.298
And continued to rise in the form of
the sun and the moon.

02:15:58.724 --> 02:16:03.865
But this is a very old tale!
As old as a night filled with stars!

02:16:21.906 --> 02:16:24.999
The night passed away giving way to
the day and the day to the night.

02:16:25.381 --> 02:16:27.288
And love bloomed with each
passing night.

02:16:27.466 --> 02:16:29.160
lt's an eternal love story!

02:16:33.236 --> 02:16:34.585
When the moon travels beyond
the passing camels...

02:16:34.763 --> 02:16:36.531
and the night progresses along
with the moon...

02:16:36.710 --> 02:16:38.204
with stars following
in a procession...

02:16:38.379 --> 02:16:40.288
lt's an eternal love story!

02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:47.232
The story continues every night.
- The wind narrates a tale.

02:16:47.799 --> 02:16:51.058
And at times people recount it.
lt's an eternal love story!

02:16:55.062 --> 02:16:58.428
The night passed away giving way to
the day and the day to the night.

02:16:58.609 --> 02:17:00.230
And love bloomed with each
passing night.

02:17:00.415 --> 02:17:02.180
lt's an eternal love story!

02:17:21.026 --> 02:17:24.285
The body shall cease to exist.
- But, love shall be ever-lasting.

02:17:24.466 --> 02:17:26.303
Time shall pass away, brother.

02:17:26.552 --> 02:17:28.531
But the folklore will survive beyond
time.

02:17:35.657 --> 02:17:39.023
The body shall cease to exist.
- But, love shall be ever-lasting.

02:17:39.202 --> 02:17:41.110
Time shall pass away, brother.

02:17:41.288 --> 02:17:43.124
But the folklore will
survive beyond time.

02:17:43.303 --> 02:17:44.856
lt would become ancient with
the passage of time.

02:17:45.076 --> 02:17:46.429
But the names shall be immortal.

02:17:46.642 --> 02:17:48.691
Their names will continue to be
mentioned till such time the sand...

02:17:49.075 --> 02:17:50.424
exists in the deserts.

02:17:50.638 --> 02:17:53.731
The night passed away giving way
to the day and the day to the night.

02:17:54.288 --> 02:17:55.982
And love bloomed with each
passing night.

02:17:56.373 --> 02:17:58.066
lt's an eternal love story!

02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:15.722
Years passed by!
When many moons had set...

02:18:16.183 --> 02:18:19.727
a halt was made at the Pipal
tree and love was born.

02:18:27.307 --> 02:18:30.673
Years passed by!
When many moons had set...

02:18:30.884 --> 02:18:34.321
a halt was made at the Pipal
tree and love was born.

02:18:34.535 --> 02:18:38.316
Ever since they appear
in all love stories.

02:18:38.532 --> 02:18:40.404
Their names will continue to be
mentioned till such time the sand...

02:18:40.583 --> 02:18:41.790
exists in the deserts.

02:18:42.181 --> 02:18:45.273
The night passed away giving way to
the day and the day to the night.

02:18:45.691 --> 02:18:47.350
And love bloomed with
each passing night.

02:18:47.532 --> 02:18:49.441
lt's an eternal love story!

02:18:53.305 --> 02:18:54.655
When the moon travels beyond
the passing camels...

02:18:54.833 --> 02:18:56.739
and the night progresses
along with the moon...

02:18:56.918 --> 02:18:58.468
with stars following
in a procession...

02:18:58.864 --> 02:19:00.558
lt's an eternal love story!

02:19:04.250 --> 02:19:05.779
The story continues every night.

02:19:06.163 --> 02:19:07.857
The wind narrates a tale.

02:19:08.248 --> 02:19:11.341
And at times people recount it.
lt's an eternal love story!
