00:39.800 --> 00:41.560
The world
will have to deal with us.

00:42.880 --> 00:44.680
<i>Previously on The 4400...</i>

00:44.800 --> 00:46.120
<i>You're
the alternative we need</i>

00:46.320 --> 00:48.760
<i>to Collier and his
promicin-pushing radicals.</i>

00:49.160 --> 00:50.840
Does that mean you'll run
for city council?

00:50.920 --> 00:52.560
It means I'm gonna run
and I'm gonna win.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.200
I intend on attacking you
right up until the day of the election.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.600
There are a lot of people out there
that are afraid of what you represent.

00:58.800 --> 01:02.120
<i>I have my eye on something greater
than just city council.</i>

01:02.760 --> 01:04.680
<i>- You hate all the 4400.
- So what if I do?</i>

01:04.800 --> 01:07.320
<i>I have reason to believe
that you're capable of terrible things,</i>

01:07.440 --> 01:10.320
and that you have an evil
living inside of you.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.520
I'm supposed to eliminate
the 4400.

01:12.600 --> 01:16.080
All this talk of a catastrophe
the 4400 are supposed to prevent?

01:16.160 --> 01:18.200
- It's lies.
- So you keep telling me.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.400
<i>Everything in that book
is going to come true.</i>

01:22.520 --> 01:24.360
Collier will lead
the human race to salvation.

01:24.520 --> 01:25.560
You will help him.

01:30.280 --> 01:31.760
<I>I found the guy for the job.

01:34.640 --> 01:36.200
<i>His name's Robert Shaftoe.</i>

01:38.920 --> 01:40.120
<i>Ex-Marine.</i>

01:41.200 --> 01:42.240
<i>Dead-eye sniper.</i>

01:43.120 --> 01:44.480
<i>He did some work
for our...</i>

01:44.640 --> 01:46.960
<i>organization,
out of Kansas City.</i>

01:48.600 --> 01:50.160
<i>If you want someone killed,</i>

01:50.600 --> 01:52.400
<i>until they're completely dead,</i>

01:53.000 --> 01:54.440
<i>then Shaftoe's your man.</i>

01:57.240 --> 01:58.200
<i>Sounds good.</i>

01:58.680 --> 01:59.640
<i>Bring him in.</i>

01:59.720 --> 02:01.480
<i>Are you sure
you wanna go through with this?</i>

02:01.960 --> 02:04.280
<i>Because once I bring Shaftoe
through that door,</i>

02:04.600 --> 02:05.800
<i>there's no going back.</i>

02:06.200 --> 02:07.160
<i>The target...</i>

02:07.520 --> 02:08.479
<i>is a dead man.</i>

02:09.639 --> 02:11.320
<i>- Completely.
- Oh, my God.</i>

02:11.440 --> 02:14.000
Come on, the acting, the dialogue,
this is horrendous.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.040
- Marco, why are we watching this?
- Just, shh...

02:16.120 --> 02:17.520
The best part's coming up.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.120
<i>The assignment is dangerous.</i>

02:31.280 --> 02:33.440
<i>In fact, it might be
the most dangerous assignment</i>

02:33.560 --> 02:35.000
<i>you've ever been assigned.</i>

02:35.360 --> 02:36.480
<i>But if you succeed,</i>

02:37.120 --> 02:38.600
<i>the danger will be worth it.</i>

02:39.320 --> 02:40.320
<i>And the rewards?</i>

02:41.640 --> 02:43.680
<i>They will be worth...
the danger.</i>

02:46.320 --> 02:48.080
<i>Danger is my business.</i>

02:49.240 --> 02:50.720
<i>Consider the target dead.</i>

02:55.120 --> 02:56.160
<i>Completely...</i>

02:56.880 --> 02:57.840
<i>dead.</i>

02:58.280 --> 03:00.200
That's our guy.
That's Curtis Peck.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.000
He's an original recipe 4400.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.200
Correction...

03:04.320 --> 03:07.320
- He's our favorite original recipe.
- Before he disappeared,

03:07.480 --> 03:09.600
Curtis wrote, directed,
and starred in horror movies.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.480
Real low-Budget stuff.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.320
You know,
the sets were mostly in his house.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.400
The actors?

03:14.520 --> 03:16.200
Pretty much
just his friends and family.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.000
Really?
I never would have guessed.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.400
After he came back,

03:19.520 --> 03:20.720
Curtis kept on making movies,

03:20.880 --> 03:21.880
but he shifted genres.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.280
Each one of his movies
is about an unsolved mystery.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.400
He did one about
Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.160
He filmed a costume drama
in his backyard

03:29.280 --> 03:31.040
about the lost colonies at Roanoke.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.120
You just saw his take
on JFK's assassination.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.480
That's great, Marco.
I'm glad this guy has a hobby.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.120
It's not just a hobby.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.640
Some people think that
making these films

03:39.800 --> 03:42.360
- is Curtis's 4400 ability.
- Come on, guys,

03:42.440 --> 03:44.400
you're not telling us
that that movie...

03:44.520 --> 03:46.720
tells us what really happened
to president Kennedy?

03:46.840 --> 03:48.120
There's no way
to know for sure,

03:48.240 --> 03:49.960
but, I mean,
there really is an ex-Marine

03:50.080 --> 03:51.280
named Robert Shaftoe,

03:51.400 --> 03:54.640
and he really was in Dallas
on november 22nd, 1963.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.600
You can't prove Curtis is right,

03:56.720 --> 03:58.280
but you also can't deny

03:58.360 --> 04:00.320
that his theories are compelling.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.120
Some people want to think
everything is a conspiracy,

04:02.240 --> 04:04.040
and I'm sure that this guy
is really appealing to them,

04:04.120 --> 04:05.680
but, Marco,
we've got  a lot of stuff on our plate,

04:05.760 --> 04:07.720
and we just don't have time
to look into something

04:07.800 --> 04:09.600
that might be a 4400 ability.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.800
Don't think I could sit through
another one of those movies.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.760
We didn't ask you down here
to tell you about his ability.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.279
Curtis disappeared.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.519
Nobody can find him.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.079
About 10 days ago,
he stopped posting on his myspace page.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.280
We noticed, so we tried
to get in touch with him.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.800
He's not picking up the phone,
he's not answering emails.

04:27.040 --> 04:29.000
I know, I know,
no big deal, right?

04:29.320 --> 04:32.760
I wasn't really worried
until he missed his last NTAC check-in.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.600
Curtis Peck has dropped off the map.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.280
Somebody should look into it.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.160
- What is this place?
- I don't know,

04:48.240 --> 04:50.080
Cassie just said
we should come here.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.760
I think it's an old bomb shelter.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.880
We should be safe here. It doesn't look
like anyone's been here in years.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.080
I don't understand
why we came to Seattle.

05:02.240 --> 05:04.360
We just led a hundred people
into a city

05:04.440 --> 05:06.120
where everyone's looking for us.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.120
Nobody has a place to stay.
Nobody knows what to do next.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.360
Are you telling me
this is the answer?

05:12.600 --> 05:14.880
- This place is a mess.
- We'll repair it.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.040
Thank you for finding this for us.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.840
You have a truly
extraordinary ability.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.160
Get everyone settled in.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.280
This place is perfect.

05:26.640 --> 05:27.640
We begin here.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.240
How much you wanna bet
we're about to wake up a man

05:36.320 --> 05:37.680
with a crushing  hangover?

05:44.240 --> 05:45.160
Curtis!

05:45.560 --> 05:46.720
Curtis Peck!

05:56.080 --> 05:57.640
You think someone
broke into the place?

05:57.760 --> 05:59.800
Maybe, or else this guy's
as bad at housekeeping

05:59.880 --> 06:01.280
as he is at making movies.

06:03.360 --> 06:06.600
It doesn't look like anything's missing.
All his video equipment is sitting here.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.720
Are you looking for Curtis?

06:10.160 --> 06:11.880
Yes, we are.
We're from NTAC.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.720
- Do you know him?
- Of course.

06:13.880 --> 06:14.960
I'm Neal Handler.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.840
I live around back.
I'm Curtis' neighbor.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.880
And... his collaborator.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.440
I'm proud to say
I've been in more of his movies

06:23.600 --> 06:24.720
than anyone else.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.520
- Yeah, we've... seen your work.
- Thank you.

06:29.560 --> 06:32.400
I haven't seen Curtis in a few days.
Is he all right?

06:32.640 --> 06:34.880
Well, that's what
we're trying to find out.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.200
Do you know
if Curtis had any enemies,

06:37.320 --> 06:39.360
or anyone who might want
to break into his house?

06:39.480 --> 06:40.640
Enemies?

06:41.040 --> 06:42.000
Take your pick.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.400
The CIA, the mafia...

06:44.560 --> 06:45.840
the freemasons.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Curtis exposed
a lot of people.

06:48.360 --> 06:49.320
So you...

06:49.680 --> 06:51.200
you believe his movies are real?

06:51.840 --> 06:53.080
Of course.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.880
That's why
they brought him back

06:56.000 --> 06:57.840
in a ball of light.

06:58.320 --> 07:01.720
To tell the truth
to a reluctant world!

07:05.040 --> 07:06.080
I'll tell you what, though,

07:07.080 --> 07:08.720
if someone did toss this place,

07:09.200 --> 07:12.000
I can guarantee you they didn't find
what they were looking for.

07:12.840 --> 07:13.800
Curtis has...

07:14.280 --> 07:15.560
a secret hiding place.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.760
He keeps his journal in there.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.240
All his script notes.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.680
Could you show it to us?

07:21.440 --> 07:23.440
We just want to help out your friend,
That's all.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.320
We really like his movies, too.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.320
I mean,
we just saw the one on JFK,

07:27.440 --> 07:30.160
and it was... good.
You were really good.

07:31.240 --> 07:32.200
It's here.

07:36.000 --> 07:36.960
Here.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.440
Curtis uses those
for inspiration.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.920
<i>If you're watching this,
then that means I'm in trouble.</i>

07:51.400 --> 07:52.760
<i>Deep trouble.</i>

07:53.040 --> 07:55.920
<i>Don't believe anything you hear
about a car accident or a suicide.</i>

07:56.040 --> 07:58.240
<i>If I'm gone,
it's because they came after me.</i>

08:00.160 --> 08:02.560
<i>I have an idea for a new movie.</i>

08:02.680 --> 08:04.360
<i>It's big.
It's so big,</i>

08:04.440 --> 08:06.600
<i>it's going to change everything
if I get to make it,</i>

08:06.720 --> 08:08.320
<i>and that's
what they're scared of.</i>

08:13.880 --> 08:15.720
<i>That's them.
They're here now.</i>

08:15.920 --> 08:17.960
<i>You need to know,
Jordan Collier...</i>

08:18.080 --> 08:20.320
<i>the 4400... they're not the ones
you should be scared of.</i>

08:20.440 --> 08:22.600
<i>There's something else out there,
something worse,...</i>

08:22.680 --> 08:25.240
<I>it's much worse,
and they're coming for me now.

<i>...consider the target dead.</i>

09:27.570 --> 09:30.290
<i>Completely dead.</i>

09:31.450 --> 09:34.410
According to Curtis, Jimmy Hoffa
was buried in the Florida everglades.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.490
If you really believe that,
you should read this.

09:36.690 --> 09:38.130
I ran a background check
on Curtis.

09:38.290 --> 09:40.370
He owes money
to credit card companies, the IRS.

09:40.490 --> 09:42.490
He's three years behind
on his alimony payments.

09:42.610 --> 09:43.570
I talked to his ex-wife.

09:43.730 --> 09:45.970
She moved to Wisconsin
just to get away from Curtis.

09:46.090 --> 09:48.170
She hasn't heard from him
in nine months.

09:49.210 --> 09:51.650
Look, if anybody's coming
after this guy, it should be...

09:51.970 --> 09:54.090
creditors, or movie critics.

09:54.570 --> 09:56.450
But he has almost 6 figures
of outstanding debt.

09:56.570 --> 09:58.210
Isn't it possible
he just skipped town?

09:58.890 --> 10:00.170
I don't know.

10:00.290 --> 10:02.690
He looked genuinely scared
at the end of that video we found,

10:02.770 --> 10:05.090
and I don't think Curtis is
a good enough actor to fake that.

10:05.570 --> 10:06.530
Besides...

10:06.930 --> 10:09.930
if making movies is really
his 4400 ability...

10:10.930 --> 10:12.610
aren't you even just
a little bit curious ?

10:12.730 --> 10:15.250
Don't you want to know what's out there
that's bigger than Jordan Collier?

10:15.370 --> 10:17.570
Until we have evidence
that tells me this guy's legit,

10:17.650 --> 10:19.250
all I want to do
is make sure he's okay.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.250
Look at the credits.
Ever since Curtis got back,

10:22.370 --> 10:24.450
his movies have been produced
by a guy called Stuart Henley.

10:24.570 --> 10:25.610
I checked him out.

10:25.810 --> 10:27.690
He's a retired lawyer.
He lives nearby.

10:27.810 --> 10:30.610
Maybe he'd know something
about Curtis' latest movie idea.

10:30.730 --> 10:31.690
It's worth a shot.

10:32.250 --> 10:34.570
At the very least, I'd like to look
into the eyes of the man who put up...

10:34.690 --> 10:37.330
good money to pay for
"I dismembered Jimmy Hoffa."

10:37.650 --> 10:39.250
<i>No, I don't think that
my announcement</i>

10:39.410 --> 10:40.730
<I>that I intend to run for mayor

10:40.850 --> 10:42.290
<I>will mean that
I'll be spending less time

10:42.370 --> 10:44.490
<I>monitoring
Shawn Farrell's candidacy.

10:44.570 --> 10:45.970
<I>If anything,
I think that the mayor's office

10:46.090 --> 10:48.930
<I>would allow me a stronger platform
with which to oppose him...

10:50.450 --> 10:51.490
Mr. Farrell?

10:51.610 --> 10:53.690
- This just came by messenger.
- Thank you.

10:55.050 --> 10:57.690
We're going to be working together
every day. You can call me Shawn.

11:19.130 --> 11:20.850
<i>Hey, Shawn...
it's Kyle.</i>

11:25.370 --> 11:27.250
Where are you?
I've been worried about you.

11:27.850 --> 11:30.410
I'm fine, man.
I'm better than fine, actually.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.970
I'm as good as I've been
in a long time.

11:34.010 --> 11:34.970
Did you get the package?

11:37.130 --> 11:38.090
You sent this?

11:38.290 --> 11:39.250
<i>We did.</i>

11:39.410 --> 11:41.010
Look, it's really important, man.

11:41.130 --> 11:43.210
You need to read the whole thing
before your meeting.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.410
What meeting, Kyle?

11:45.650 --> 11:47.450
<i>Jordan's nearby.
He wants to see you.</i>

11:49.370 --> 11:50.370
You're with Jordan?

11:50.890 --> 11:52.250
What does he want
to see me about?

11:52.850 --> 11:54.210
It's important, okay?

11:55.050 --> 11:57.010
Call me on this number
after you finish the book.

11:57.130 --> 11:58.810
We'll send someone
to come get you.

12:10.890 --> 12:11.850
Mr. Henley?

12:12.330 --> 12:13.730
I can hear a radio
playing inside,

12:13.810 --> 12:15.890
and I swear I heard
someone moving around.

12:18.050 --> 12:19.170
Mr. Henley!

12:20.050 --> 12:21.010
He's back here.

12:21.770 --> 12:22.730
Stuart Henley, wait!

12:26.250 --> 12:27.210
Just wait!

12:27.930 --> 12:29.850
I promise
I won't tell anybody!

12:29.970 --> 12:31.210
- Don't kill me!
- Just relax.

12:31.330 --> 12:33.330
- Nobody's going to kill you.
- We're from NTAC.

12:33.450 --> 12:35.410
We're just trying to locate
Curtis Peck.

12:35.530 --> 12:37.130
You won't find him.
They got to him.

12:37.250 --> 12:38.850
Who are they?
Why'd you run from us?

12:38.930 --> 12:40.130
What are you so scared of?

12:40.210 --> 12:42.850
The people from Curtis' movie...
"The Marked."

12:43.410 --> 12:44.850
That's the name of his movie?

12:45.210 --> 12:46.210
Can you tell us about it?

12:48.090 --> 12:49.650
About a month ago,
he came to me,

12:49.770 --> 12:51.410
said he had an idea
for a new movie,

12:51.530 --> 12:52.610
called "The Marked."

12:53.370 --> 12:55.090
He said it was
his biggest film yet.

12:55.690 --> 12:56.650
I was fascinated,

12:56.770 --> 12:58.890
so I asked him to make me
a short trailer.

12:59.170 --> 13:01.810
I like to see what the movie's about
before I write a check.

13:03.770 --> 13:05.810
He gave me the trailer
about two weeks ago.

13:07.450 --> 13:08.450
Do you still have a copy?

13:10.290 --> 13:12.730
And you're more than welcome
to it, because...

13:13.330 --> 13:15.290
if what Curtis is saying is true,

13:15.610 --> 13:17.890
Then I wish to God
I had never watched it.

13:24.850 --> 13:26.010
<i>This is the world.</i>

13:26.530 --> 13:27.450
<i>Look familiar?</i>

13:28.170 --> 13:29.130
<i>It should,</i>

13:29.610 --> 13:30.690
<i>and it shouldn't.</i>

13:31.650 --> 13:35.010
<i>We all know it changed forever
when the 4400 came back.</i>

13:35.810 --> 13:36.770
<i>Their mission?</i>

13:37.050 --> 13:39.210
<i>They were sent back
by the future</i>

13:39.610 --> 13:41.250
<i>to stop a catastrophe.</i>

13:42.010 --> 13:43.610
<i>But not everyone
from the future</i>

13:43.690 --> 13:45.210
<i>thought they were
a good thing.</i>

13:45.850 --> 13:47.330
<i>There's a faction of elites</i>

13:47.650 --> 13:51.250
<I>who want the future
to stay exactly as it is.

13:51.690 --> 13:52.650
<i>I call them...</i>

13:54.290 --> 13:55.330
<i>The Marked.</i>

13:57.570 --> 13:59.250
<i>10 agents from the future,</i>

13:59.530 --> 14:01.050
<i>inserted into the bodies</i>

14:01.290 --> 14:03.530
<i>of 10 prominent people
from today.</i>

14:04.890 --> 14:06.930
<i>Their bodies and minds
have been hijacked</i>

14:07.050 --> 14:08.930
<i>to pursue the agenda
of the future.</i>

14:10.290 --> 14:11.250
<i>Their goal?</i>

14:11.570 --> 14:13.130
<i>To guide world events...</i>

14:13.530 --> 14:15.210
<i>and to stop the 4400.</i>

14:16.890 --> 14:18.730
<i>The only evidence they exist?</i>

14:19.930 --> 14:23.210
<i>a mark behind
their left earlobe.</i>

14:23.930 --> 14:25.450
<i>The remnant of the procedure</i>

14:25.890 --> 14:27.530
<i>that grafted
a new consciousness</i>

14:27.610 --> 14:29.010
<I>onto their victims.

14:29.930 --> 14:31.130
<i>My movie,
"The Marked",</i>

14:31.490 --> 14:34.610
<i>will tell the chilling tale
of this global conspiracy.</i>

14:34.850 --> 14:36.050
<i>It will name names,</i>

14:36.850 --> 14:40.050
<i>starting with the appearance
of the first marked,</i>

14:40.610 --> 14:42.170
<i>a man named...</i>

14:42.250 --> 14:44.050
<i>Matthew Ross.</i>

14:45.610 --> 14:49.130
<i>Matthew Ross was a lobbyist
with access to Jordan Collier.</i>

14:49.410 --> 14:50.530
<i>After he was marked,</i>

14:50.650 --> 14:53.090
<i>his job was to guide
The Marked's ultimate weapon,</i>

14:53.570 --> 14:54.770
<i>Isabelle Tyler,</i>

14:54.890 --> 14:56.290
<i>into accepting her role</i>

14:56.410 --> 14:59.170
<i>as the agent
of the 4400's destruction.</i>

14:59.250 --> 15:00.970
Isabelle, I told you.

15:01.090 --> 15:02.450
You have to accept your role

15:02.530 --> 15:05.730
as the agent
of the 4400's destruction.

15:06.170 --> 15:08.490
<i>But everything did not go
according to plan.</i>

15:08.610 --> 15:10.330
I don't think so, Matthew.

15:10.850 --> 15:12.570
Today's graduation day,

15:13.330 --> 15:14.290
and you're...

15:14.850 --> 15:16.010
my diploma.

15:36.090 --> 15:39.170
<i>But The Marked do not accept
defeat lying down.</i>

15:39.290 --> 15:40.650
<i>They continue to plan.</i>

15:41.010 --> 15:42.290
<i>They have their greedy fingers</i>

15:42.370 --> 15:44.690
<i>on the marionette strings
of the world,</i>

15:44.810 --> 15:47.970
<i>and we, their puppets,
don't even know it.</i>

15:50.810 --> 15:52.730
<i>The group gathered
for the first time</i>

15:52.810 --> 15:54.690
<i>at the behest of Drew Imroth.</i>

15:55.570 --> 15:56.610
<i>That's right.</i>

15:56.770 --> 16:00.170
<i>The CEO of the biggest
software company in the world</i>

16:00.290 --> 16:01.450
<i>is one of The Marked.</i>

16:01.610 --> 16:04.090
I know it's dangerous for us all
to meet like this,

16:04.650 --> 16:06.970
but the information I have
is important...

16:07.850 --> 16:10.170
Very, very important.

16:10.410 --> 16:13.050
It better be important,
Mr. Imroth.

16:13.170 --> 16:14.530
It's easter.

16:14.690 --> 16:17.130
Do you know how hard it is
to get away from the vatican

16:17.250 --> 16:18.330
at easter?

16:18.450 --> 16:20.210
Take it down a notch,
your eminence.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.010
I have big news.

16:24.330 --> 16:26.330
Jordan collier is back,

16:28.530 --> 16:30.450
and we need to stop him...

16:32.290 --> 16:34.730
completely stop him.

16:35.010 --> 16:35.970
<i>"The Marked."</i>

16:36.090 --> 16:38.890
<i>A direct market thriller
available in all territories</i>

16:39.010 --> 16:40.450
<I>in 2008.

16:42.850 --> 16:45.250
I am so buying that movie.

16:45.370 --> 16:47.890
So either that's
the ramblings of a madman,

16:48.010 --> 16:50.890
or Curtis Peck has just exposed
the biggest conspiracy of all time.

16:51.210 --> 16:52.250
According to that movie,

16:52.370 --> 16:54.450
Matthew Ross was one of these guys,
The Marked,

16:54.810 --> 16:56.010
and Isabelle Tyler killed him.

16:56.130 --> 16:58.010
And we always wondered
if that were true.

16:58.130 --> 16:59.090
What about Imroth?

16:59.210 --> 17:00.730
I mean, the CEO
of Ubient Software

17:00.850 --> 17:03.170
is supposed to be some kind
of double agent from the future?

17:03.290 --> 17:06.410
Everyone always says that company
is trying to take over the world.

17:06.569 --> 17:07.530
Now we know it's true.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.410
The only thing we know for sure
is that Curtis Peck is a horrible,

17:10.490 --> 17:11.450
horrible film-maker.

17:12.369 --> 17:13.450
Though, I do have to admit,

17:13.530 --> 17:15.690
there are a bunch of questions
I'd like to ask him.

17:16.730 --> 17:20.010
But since he's in the wind, I guess
we'll have to settle for his producer.

17:20.369 --> 17:21.770
Get Stuart Henley in here.

17:25.490 --> 17:27.569
Mr. Henley,
it's Diana Skouris from NTAC.

17:27.650 --> 17:29.490
We need to talk.
Can you open up?

17:37.090 --> 17:38.530
It smells like exhaust.

17:40.690 --> 17:41.650
Stand back.

17:56.710 --> 17:58.870
No big surprises
in the coroner's preliminary reports,

17:58.950 --> 18:01.230
Stuart Henley died
of carbon monoxide poisoning.

18:01.390 --> 18:04.270
There's no suicide note,
but there's no sign of foul play either.

18:05.790 --> 18:06.750
So...

18:07.150 --> 18:08.750
do you really think
he committed suicide?

18:10.550 --> 18:11.670
Henley was an odd guy.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.750
I mean, He'd have to be to pay
for Curtis' movies,

18:13.830 --> 18:15.030
so I guess it's possible.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.750
But I don't know,
the timing seems off.

18:17.870 --> 18:18.990
Why would he commit suicide

18:19.070 --> 18:20.990
right after NTAC
got in touch with him?

18:21.230 --> 18:22.190
So, what then?

18:22.990 --> 18:24.350
Executed by the marked?

18:25.670 --> 18:26.990
I'm not ready to go there yet.

18:27.110 --> 18:28.670
Yeah, me neither.
But I...

18:28.790 --> 18:30.390
I got a lot of questions.

18:30.790 --> 18:32.670
You know Drew Imroth
is in that movie.

18:32.870 --> 18:35.870
Ubient's based in Seattle. Maybe we can
get in and see him tomorrow morning.

18:36.230 --> 18:37.550
And ask him what exactly?

18:38.190 --> 18:39.310
Oh, I got it,
"Excuse me.

18:39.430 --> 18:42.030
"When you're not running the biggest
computer company in the world,

18:42.150 --> 18:44.150
"are you by any chance involved in
an enormous...

18:44.230 --> 18:45.590
"intercontinental conspiracy?"

18:46.070 --> 18:47.030
Maybe.

18:47.390 --> 18:49.230
Or maybe we could just ask him
whether

18:49.310 --> 18:51.670
Curtis Peck ever tried
to get in touch with him.

18:53.950 --> 18:55.590
Sounds good.
I'll see tomorrow.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.150
- What, you're not going home?
- No, not for a while.

18:59.230 --> 19:01.110
Meghan asked me to put all this
in an email.

19:01.190 --> 19:02.950
I told her I'd get it off
to her tonight.

19:03.270 --> 19:05.710
- Want a hand?
- No, I got it. Go ahead.

19:06.030 --> 19:07.670
Spend a little time with your daughter
while she's still awake.

19:07.790 --> 19:09.270
- Thanks.
- Good night.

19:14.350 --> 19:16.950
We appreciate you taking
the time to meet with us, Mr. Imroth.

19:17.070 --> 19:18.350
It's really not a problem.

19:18.470 --> 19:20.230
I'm a huge supporter of NTAC.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.030
You guys have tough jobs.

19:22.470 --> 19:23.510
Please,have a seat.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.790
I only wish I could be
more helpful.

19:26.350 --> 19:27.550
I've never heard of this guy.

19:27.630 --> 19:29.670
You said his name was
Curtis Peck ?

19:29.790 --> 19:31.110
Yeah, that's right. He's a...

19:31.230 --> 19:32.950
He's a 4400 who...

19:33.230 --> 19:34.350
who makes movies,

19:34.510 --> 19:36.110
and you,

19:36.230 --> 19:38.390
well, you're a character
in his latest film.

19:38.590 --> 19:39.550
Really?

19:39.710 --> 19:40.710
Who plays me?

19:40.830 --> 19:42.670
I always hoped
it would be Jeff Goldblum.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.430
It's more of a low-budget
kind of thing.

19:47.190 --> 19:48.230
What's it about?

19:48.590 --> 19:51.030
Well, it's interesting.
It's creative.

19:51.110 --> 19:54.470
It's a global conspiracy
in which agents from the future

19:54.550 --> 19:56.070
have taken over
the bodies of...

19:56.230 --> 19:58.310
prominent people
from all around the world.

20:02.150 --> 20:03.190
I have to say,

20:03.590 --> 20:06.190
I'm the subject of
a lot of conspiracy theories,

20:06.270 --> 20:09.430
but that's the most innovative
one I've heard yet.

20:09.950 --> 20:13.070
So, are you here to ask me
if it's true?

20:13.510 --> 20:16.030
Because you have to figure
I wouldn't tell you even if it was.

20:16.110 --> 20:18.950
No, actually, we came to see you
because Curtis Peck has gone missing.

20:19.070 --> 20:21.430
There's a chance one of his
investors may have been murdered.

20:21.550 --> 20:22.870
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

20:23.270 --> 20:25.230
Should I be worried for
my own safety?

20:25.790 --> 20:27.030
No, we don't think so,

20:27.150 --> 20:29.590
but if Curtis should try
and get in touch with you,

20:29.710 --> 20:31.590
or if anyone should ask you

20:31.710 --> 20:33.510
about a movie called
"The Marked",

20:33.830 --> 20:35.390
could you get in touch
with us?

20:35.750 --> 20:36.870
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

20:36.990 --> 20:38.790
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

20:39.590 --> 20:40.750
Actually...

20:43.470 --> 20:45.670
This may seem like
a really strange request.

20:46.030 --> 20:48.990
Do you think we could take a look
behind your left earlobe?

20:50.630 --> 20:51.590
Let me guess,

20:51.710 --> 20:53.870
this has something to do
with that movie.

20:55.750 --> 20:56.710
Have at it.

21:04.870 --> 21:06.510
Has that mole
always been there?

21:07.550 --> 21:09.030
Ever since I was born.

21:09.630 --> 21:13.230
My dermatologist tells me
I have to keep an eye on it.

21:14.750 --> 21:16.270
So give it to me straight.

21:16.390 --> 21:18.630
Does this mean I'm one of the...

21:19.230 --> 21:20.670
What was the name
of that movie?

21:20.910 --> 21:21.990
"The Marked?"

21:24.670 --> 21:26.790
Kyle, what's with all
the spy game stuff here?

21:27.470 --> 21:30.030
Am I really this far outside
of the Collier circle of trust?

21:30.110 --> 21:31.430
It's just a precaution.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.590
I need you to promise me that
you're not going to freak out, okay?

21:35.790 --> 21:37.830
I would just like
to take this thing off, please.

21:42.750 --> 21:43.790
Hi, Shawn.

21:47.030 --> 21:49.590
- What the hell is she doing here?
- She's with us. It's okay.

21:50.190 --> 21:52.270
She just wanted to talk to you
before you saw Jordan.

21:53.230 --> 21:54.350
I'm glad you're awake...

21:56.190 --> 21:57.190
and I'm sorry.

21:58.070 --> 21:59.070
For everything.

22:01.670 --> 22:02.910
I know I was wrong,

22:03.990 --> 22:05.790
and I know
what we had wasn't love.

22:05.870 --> 22:07.310
Yeah, you're right, it wasn't.

22:09.350 --> 22:11.070
I don't expect you
to forgive me...

22:12.230 --> 22:13.230
Ever...

22:15.110 --> 22:17.630
But I just needed you
to hear it.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.310
Well,
there's no one so far gone

22:25.390 --> 22:27.390
they can't find their way
back to the movement.

22:27.870 --> 22:30.550
Even if I told the world that you
were wrong to hand out promicin?

22:32.790 --> 22:34.990
I wasn't surprised
they had you speak against me.

22:35.390 --> 22:37.070
Politics is compromise.

22:38.030 --> 22:39.950
That's why
I never pursued it myself.

22:43.750 --> 22:46.470
I understand that you are
wanting to build a bridge

22:46.550 --> 22:48.350
between positives
and the rest of the world,

22:48.470 --> 22:50.110
but, Shawn, I'm telling you,

22:50.190 --> 22:52.110
events are moving past that.

22:52.790 --> 22:54.550
We have big plans here,

22:55.070 --> 22:57.630
and when we're finished,
the 4400 won't need the mainstream.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.270
The mainstream will come to us.

22:59.510 --> 23:00.950
Is that what your book told you?

23:01.310 --> 23:02.350
I've read it.

23:02.590 --> 23:03.590
Frankly, it scares me.

23:03.670 --> 23:06.030
Are you saying that you're gonna
bring God to the world?

23:06.150 --> 23:07.910
If the word "God" frightens you,

23:08.030 --> 23:09.390
substitute "paradise".

23:09.510 --> 23:11.550
We're gonna make it happen, Shawn.
You should be here with us.

23:11.630 --> 23:13.190
Yes, but who's
in charge of paradise?

23:13.670 --> 23:15.750
How many martyrs
will it take to create it?

23:15.870 --> 23:17.710
Jordan, you've done
great things for the 4400.

23:17.790 --> 23:19.110
You have done great things
for me, but...

23:19.230 --> 23:20.710
you are on the wrong path here.

23:20.790 --> 23:22.550
And you have always been rebellious.

23:23.710 --> 23:25.910
But I think you're afraid
of change, Shawn,

23:27.390 --> 23:28.510
or it is just me?

23:28.670 --> 23:30.670
I'm against anyone
who wants to accumulate power

23:30.790 --> 23:32.910
that won't tell me exactly
what they wanna do with it.

23:32.990 --> 23:34.470
Not just you, anyone.

23:36.190 --> 23:38.030
There's a man by the name
of Gabriel Hewitt.

23:38.190 --> 23:39.470
He's running for mayor.

23:39.870 --> 23:40.950
He's dangerous.

23:41.230 --> 23:42.910
Maia Skouris
saw him in a vision.

23:43.230 --> 23:44.510
He's in charge
of prison camps,

23:44.590 --> 23:46.190
and they're
rounding up 4400s.

23:47.870 --> 23:50.230
Even if I wanted to
drop out of the race,

23:50.350 --> 23:51.870
even if I wanted to join you,

23:52.350 --> 23:53.350
I can't,

23:53.590 --> 23:54.870
because I have to stop him.

23:58.630 --> 24:01.310
Well, it sounds like you have
your hands full already.

24:04.070 --> 24:05.870
Good luck
in your political career.

24:13.470 --> 24:14.590
I'm sorry.

24:16.110 --> 24:18.190
I don't know, but that birthmark
behind Imroth's ear?

24:18.270 --> 24:20.550
It was definitely
shaped like an "x".

24:20.910 --> 24:22.950
Exactly like the ones
in Curtis' movies.

24:23.070 --> 24:24.550
It was weird, yes,

24:24.630 --> 24:26.590
but it could be
a coincidence.

24:26.790 --> 24:28.350
We're looking for
a paranoid 4400.

24:28.470 --> 24:30.670
That doesn't mean we have to
become paranoid ourselves.

24:31.110 --> 24:32.790
This man is here to see you.

24:33.030 --> 24:34.070
My name's Walt Saperstein.

24:34.150 --> 24:35.870
I'm a psychiatrist
at Feeney Memorial.

24:37.630 --> 24:39.190
I have instructions
to bring you to the hospital.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.630
You're being placed under
a 72-hour psychiatric hold.

24:41.750 --> 24:43.070
What? Why?

24:43.190 --> 24:44.470
You sent an email last night.

24:44.590 --> 24:46.470
It alleged some of the most
powerful people in the world

24:46.590 --> 24:48.190
are united
in some kind of conspiracy.

24:48.270 --> 24:49.390
No, it didn't allege anything.

24:49.470 --> 24:51.110
It's a summary of our work
on a case.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.550
Well, nevertheless,
someone in Washington read it.

24:53.830 --> 24:55.710
They've reviewed your files,
agent Baldwin. They're worried

24:55.830 --> 24:57.470
- you've had a psychotic break.
- Shut up.

24:57.590 --> 24:58.950
You sent my email on to D.C.?

24:59.030 --> 25:00.870
I do that every time
we open a case. I'm sorry.

25:00.990 --> 25:03.230
I never would've done it
if I knew this was gonna happen.

25:04.030 --> 25:04.990
Get your hands off me!

25:05.070 --> 25:06.430
It's only going to
get worse for you

25:06.510 --> 25:08.430
if you put up a fight.
It's only temporary.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.550
You need to go with them. We'll do
everything we can to end this quickly.

25:15.950 --> 25:16.990
Fine.

25:26.590 --> 25:28.230
Well, I don't understand.

25:28.990 --> 25:31.110
What do you mean that no one
can get in to see him?

25:33.150 --> 25:35.110
Well, how long is Tom
going to be in isolation?

25:37.750 --> 25:39.630
Okay, forget it.
I'll call back in the morning.

25:56.670 --> 25:57.750
Don't move.

25:59.510 --> 26:00.710
What are you doing down here?

26:00.790 --> 26:01.870
Don't shoot me.

26:02.150 --> 26:03.630
I'm the one
you're looking for.

26:04.870 --> 26:05.870
Curtis?

26:06.710 --> 26:07.750
You're alive.

26:08.270 --> 26:09.350
I am.

26:10.550 --> 26:12.070
If you can keep me that way,

26:12.270 --> 26:14.230
I'll tell you
all about The Marked.

26:16.590 --> 26:18.150
So how did you find me?

26:19.510 --> 26:21.790
I've been in hiding ever since
I made that movie trailer.

26:21.910 --> 26:23.950
I knew they'd be coming for me.

26:25.150 --> 26:26.710
My buddy, Neal,
sent me an email

26:26.790 --> 26:29.190
after you and your partner
came by my house.

26:29.990 --> 26:31.310
He thought I could trust you.

26:33.510 --> 26:35.190
What can you tell me
about these people?

26:35.390 --> 26:36.590
Well, not everything.

26:37.150 --> 26:38.750
I haven't finished
writing the script.

26:39.470 --> 26:41.030
That's how
my ability works.

26:41.270 --> 26:43.750
Ideas just jump into
my head while I'm writing,

26:43.870 --> 26:46.350
but I don't know the whole story
until I write the end.

26:46.590 --> 26:47.630
Let's see,

26:48.670 --> 26:49.830
they don't have abilities.

26:49.910 --> 26:51.670
The procedure
doesn't work that way.

26:52.830 --> 26:56.550
I do know that all 10 of them
had a meeting in 2005.

26:56.670 --> 26:58.510
That was the only time
they were all together.

26:58.790 --> 26:59.990
It was in Tunis.

27:00.230 --> 27:01.750
That's a city in North Africa.

27:03.070 --> 27:05.510
No other names
other than Drew Imroth?

27:06.150 --> 27:07.270
Not yet.

27:07.790 --> 27:08.830
That's why I came to you.

27:08.910 --> 27:11.190
I need a safe place
where I can write.

27:18.230 --> 27:19.790
You're a fan of my movies.

27:19.950 --> 27:20.910
Cool.

27:21.030 --> 27:22.510
Yeah, I've seen them all.

27:23.430 --> 27:25.230
Uh, it's a pleasure
to have you here.

27:26.750 --> 27:29.270
Yeah, you can work right there
if you want.

27:29.750 --> 27:32.270
Thank you so much, Marco.
I really appreciate this.

27:32.390 --> 27:34.270
We were careful on the way
over here. We weren't followed.

27:34.390 --> 27:36.150
It's okay.
I'll keep him working.

27:37.030 --> 27:39.670
It's been a while since you've seen
the inside of my place, huh?

27:41.790 --> 27:43.190
We should make
a pot of coffee.

27:44.030 --> 27:46.550
Do you mind staying up with me?
I like to have somebody I can...

27:46.630 --> 27:48.030
bounce ideas off.

27:49.990 --> 27:51.030
Coffee.

27:56.390 --> 27:58.510
Hey, Joanna, I'm going to need you
to juggle around

27:58.590 --> 28:00.550
a couple of my healing
appointments for today.

28:00.870 --> 28:01.870
What is it?

28:03.110 --> 28:05.070
Gabriel Hewitt
had a stroke last night.

28:06.190 --> 28:07.230
- What?
- It's bad.

28:07.310 --> 28:08.710
I guess he has brain damage.

28:08.870 --> 28:10.390
They're saying he's going to
have to resign his seat

28:10.510 --> 28:11.470
on the city council,

28:11.790 --> 28:13.670
and withdraw
from the race for mayor.

28:58.630 --> 29:00.390
I just got off the phone
with the hospital.

29:01.070 --> 29:02.030
Tom is fine.

29:02.150 --> 29:03.710
If I keep the pressure on,
there's a chance

29:03.790 --> 29:05.870
they may end his psych hold
a day early.

29:06.750 --> 29:08.630
- What are you working on?
- You want me to tell you,

29:08.710 --> 29:10.470
or should I just
put it an email?

29:12.510 --> 29:13.510
That's not fair.

29:14.030 --> 29:15.470
I had nothing to do with
what happened to Tom.

29:15.550 --> 29:16.790
If I could've stopped it,
I would've.

29:16.870 --> 29:19.830
Tom's psych hold had nothing
to do with his state of mind.

29:20.350 --> 29:22.910
We were getting close to something,
and they sent us a warning.

29:23.110 --> 29:25.830
Who? The people from
Curtis' movie, The Marked?

29:26.430 --> 29:27.750
Well, I can't prove that,

29:28.110 --> 29:31.510
but I do know that Drew Imroth
was in Tunisia of June, 2005.

29:31.590 --> 29:33.470
If The Marked ever gathered,
that's when it happened.

29:33.550 --> 29:36.070
At the same time,
Wesley Burke was also there.

29:36.990 --> 29:38.790
The political advisor
to the president?

29:38.990 --> 29:40.430
What was he doing in Africa
while the White House

29:40.510 --> 29:42.150
was gearing up
for mid-term elections?

29:42.230 --> 29:43.590
I don't know,
but he had company.

29:43.750 --> 29:45.150
That's cardinal Emmanuel Calabria.

29:45.230 --> 29:47.790
Rumor is, he finished third
in the last papal election.

29:48.270 --> 29:50.350
This is all interesting,
but Drew Imroth heads up

29:50.430 --> 29:51.910
the world's largest
charitable foundation.

29:51.990 --> 29:53.670
He travels to Africa
all the time,

29:54.070 --> 29:55.470
and these other guys,
well...

29:55.750 --> 29:57.070
Who knows why they were there.

29:57.870 --> 29:59.350
Well, I'm going to find out,

30:00.030 --> 30:01.030
And I'm also gonna learn

30:01.110 --> 30:03.030
who else was there
to play that week.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.830
Let me know if I can help.

30:38.750 --> 30:41.230
The Marked have no way of
getting in contact with the future.

30:41.350 --> 30:42.990
It's a one-way ticket.
They're cut off here.

30:43.110 --> 30:44.470
Okay, Curtis,
that's very interesting,

30:44.550 --> 30:45.670
but there are
no new names here.

30:45.750 --> 30:47.910
We need some facts
and things that we can verify.

30:48.030 --> 30:50.190
They'll come.
I'm on a roll.

30:50.750 --> 30:52.110
Tom, are you okay?

30:52.230 --> 30:53.630
<i>They did something to me, Diana.</i>

30:54.070 --> 30:55.310
They changed me.

30:55.430 --> 30:57.190
Whoa, just take it easy.
Where are you?

30:58.350 --> 30:59.390
The hospital.

30:59.550 --> 31:00.750
<i>They just let me out.</i>

31:00.950 --> 31:02.030
<i>Can you come and get me?</i>

31:02.270 --> 31:03.910
Are you sure
it wasn't there before?

31:04.030 --> 31:05.070
I'm positive.

31:05.430 --> 31:06.670
They did something to me
last night, Diana.

31:06.790 --> 31:07.910
Those people who came into my room,

31:08.030 --> 31:09.390
They were dressed
for an operation.

31:09.790 --> 31:10.870
They put something into me.

31:10.990 --> 31:14.390
What? Like another person?
Another consciousness?

31:14.630 --> 31:16.590
Hey, Tom, I don't think
it works that way.

31:16.710 --> 31:18.150
Curtis is working on
his script right now,

31:18.270 --> 31:20.830
and according to him, The Marked
are cut off from the future.

31:20.910 --> 31:22.310
They can't just
make more of them.

31:22.430 --> 31:24.350
Yeah, but one of them's dead.
Matthew Ross.

31:24.470 --> 31:27.070
What if they took whatever was
inside of him and put it into me?

31:28.270 --> 31:30.470
No, you can't be sure of that.

31:34.150 --> 31:35.190
Tom, just...

31:35.390 --> 31:37.150
please just tell me
that you're still you.

31:40.230 --> 31:41.230
I think so.

31:42.070 --> 31:43.390
I mean, for now, anyway.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.430
It's crap.

31:46.950 --> 31:48.390
I can't get this scene right.

31:48.750 --> 31:50.430
they're at the meeting
in Tunisia.

31:50.990 --> 31:53.070
They're face to face
for the first time.

31:53.550 --> 31:55.870
Imroth is introducing them
to each other.

31:57.790 --> 31:59.710
I know what the scene is.
I just can't...

32:00.310 --> 32:01.510
- nail it.
- Look...

32:02.350 --> 32:04.310
I have to think creatively
for my job, too.

32:04.470 --> 32:06.030
I mean, I share an office

32:06.150 --> 32:08.470
with two of the most
annoying guys on the planet.

32:09.350 --> 32:11.190
Believe me,
I get stuck all the time.

32:12.430 --> 32:13.510
Know what I do?

32:14.710 --> 32:15.910
I shut my eyes,

32:16.790 --> 32:18.190
and I think of song lyrics.

32:19.950 --> 32:21.230
Sounds dumb, right?

32:21.350 --> 32:22.910
But I swear,
it almost always works.

32:29.870 --> 32:30.990
What are you thinking of?

32:31.310 --> 32:33.430
<i>"The trooper", Iron Maiden.</i>

32:36.630 --> 32:38.390
Hey, whatever gets you going.

32:38.710 --> 32:39.790
Be right back.

33:11.590 --> 33:12.630
Did you do this?

33:13.350 --> 33:14.430
Did you do this?
Did you order

33:14.550 --> 33:16.150
one of your followers
to give Hewitt a stroke?

33:16.270 --> 33:17.270
Have we grown that far apart?

33:17.390 --> 33:18.950
You actually believe
I'm capable of that?

33:19.030 --> 33:20.470
Jordan, I don't know what
you're capable of anymore.

33:20.550 --> 33:22.710
All I know I that two days ago
I came in here ad I told you

33:22.790 --> 33:25.590
that Hewitt as dangerous.
Now he has brain damage

33:25.670 --> 33:27.150
and he probably
won't have a career.

33:27.230 --> 33:30.030
Then it looks like
fate intervened on our behalf.

33:30.630 --> 33:32.110
You're not answering my question.

33:32.190 --> 33:34.230
Because I find it offensive!

33:34.310 --> 33:36.230
You're the one who's always
saying that we're at war.

33:36.310 --> 33:38.230
Why wouldn't Hewitt just
be another casualty to you?

33:38.350 --> 33:40.470
Just like all those people
that died taking your shot?

33:40.550 --> 33:41.910
Those people made a choice.

33:42.030 --> 33:43.790
They knew the risks.
I knew the risks.

33:46.550 --> 33:50.110
I did not order anyone
to attack Gabriel Hewitt.

33:52.990 --> 33:54.150
I don't believe you.

33:55.390 --> 33:57.950
I can't begin to tell you
how disappointing that is.

33:58.030 --> 33:59.070
Well, it's true.

33:59.870 --> 34:01.910
That's why
I can't follow you anymore.

34:08.750 --> 34:11.190
Did you see the license plate
on the car that took him away?

34:11.469 --> 34:13.350
I'm sorry.
What do we do now?

34:13.429 --> 34:15.469
We need to tell Meghan,
bring the whole building into this,

34:15.590 --> 34:17.550
hope we find Curtis
before the worst happens.

34:20.949 --> 34:22.550
They just told me
you were released.

34:22.710 --> 34:23.670
Are you okay?

34:23.830 --> 34:25.350
Yeah, yeah.
Pretty much.

34:25.590 --> 34:28.070
We were coming to see you. We need
to talk to you about Curtis Peck.

34:28.270 --> 34:30.550
He came to me for protection
a couple of nights ago.

34:30.870 --> 34:32.949
We tried to keep him safe,
but we lost him.

34:33.150 --> 34:34.630
We think The Marked took him.

34:36.670 --> 34:38.230
Guys, Curtis Peck is
in the building.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.389
He came in about an hour ago.

34:39.469 --> 34:41.670
He went straight down
to NTAC medical for his checkup.

34:42.350 --> 34:43.630
Sorry I had to rush out.

34:43.710 --> 34:45.710
I know this is going to
sound weird,

34:45.790 --> 34:48.030
but I got a call from this...

34:48.389 --> 34:50.190
from this big movie producer
who's in town.

34:50.510 --> 34:51.909
He's a big fan of my work.

34:52.150 --> 34:54.830
He offered me a deal to direct
a big Hollywood movie.

34:55.310 --> 34:57.710
Don Incubus, demon P.I.

34:57.950 --> 34:59.670
It's a comic book adaptation.

35:00.990 --> 35:02.150
It's perfect for me.

35:02.790 --> 35:04.350
I'm in business, guys.

35:04.630 --> 35:05.830
This is what I always wanted!

35:05.910 --> 35:07.390
But, Curtis,
what about the conspiracy?

35:07.510 --> 35:09.390
- What about The Marked?
- You were almost done.

35:09.470 --> 35:11.310
You were just about to
tell us all the names.

35:11.670 --> 35:13.030
The names?

35:13.390 --> 35:14.710
Well, there are no names.

35:15.510 --> 35:16.550
Not really.

35:16.950 --> 35:18.590
I made the whole thing up.

35:19.870 --> 35:22.430
I'm putting that project on the shelf.
I couldn't finish it.

35:27.310 --> 35:29.830
What, they got to you.
they bought you off, huh?

35:29.990 --> 35:32.310
You really believed that stuff,
didn't you?

35:32.630 --> 35:33.870
Look, I'm flattered,

35:34.630 --> 35:36.270
but you need to calm down.

35:36.790 --> 35:38.790
There's no such thing
as The Marked.

35:41.990 --> 35:45.110
Just like Robert Shaftoe
didn't shoot JFK.

35:46.110 --> 35:47.310
They're just movies.

35:50.030 --> 35:53.070
So... I'm sorry I missed my checkups.

35:53.310 --> 35:54.630
It won't happen again.

35:56.470 --> 35:57.590
Can I leave now?

35:57.950 --> 35:59.190
I gotta pack.

35:59.830 --> 36:01.030
I'm going to Hollywood.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.990
There's nothing unusual there.

36:13.270 --> 36:14.830
I spent all afternoon
in NTAC medical,

36:14.910 --> 36:16.950
and as far as they could tell,
there's nothing different with me.

36:17.070 --> 36:19.110
Well, that's good, Tom.
It's all a mind game.

36:19.190 --> 36:20.670
They just want us to back off.

36:20.910 --> 36:21.910
Well, it's not going to work.

36:22.030 --> 36:23.350
We're gonna find out
the truth about these people

36:23.430 --> 36:24.950
with or without Curtis Peck.

36:25.430 --> 36:28.190
Excuse me, agent Baldwin?
agent Skouris?

36:28.510 --> 36:29.790
Sorry for the surprise.

36:29.870 --> 36:31.870
I asked my driver to make a detour.

36:32.830 --> 36:35.710
I can't get that crazy movie
idea out of my head.

36:35.950 --> 36:37.870
What was it called,
The Marked?

36:38.030 --> 36:39.710
You know damn well
what it was called.

36:39.910 --> 36:41.150
I guess I do.

36:41.750 --> 36:43.950
I keep thinking
what it would be like

36:44.070 --> 36:46.830
to actually be
one of those guys.

36:47.190 --> 36:49.590
Imagine if you were
stuck in the past,

36:49.710 --> 36:52.150
just cut off from your friends
and your family.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.470
That'd be quite a sacrifice,
wouldn't it?

36:54.790 --> 36:56.670
They sound kind of like
heroes to me.

36:57.350 --> 36:59.190
Well,
heroes don't have people killed,

36:59.590 --> 37:02.150
They don't consume the personalities
of innocent men and women.

37:02.230 --> 37:03.870
I don't know exactly
what The Marked are up to.

37:03.990 --> 37:05.190
I haven't seen the movie.

37:05.510 --> 37:06.670
You never will now.

37:06.990 --> 37:07.990
No one will.

37:08.950 --> 37:10.390
Maybe it's better that way.

37:10.830 --> 37:13.630
Seems to me their work would be
best done in secret.

37:13.870 --> 37:15.230
If they are out there,

37:15.830 --> 37:16.790
I would think

37:16.990 --> 37:19.030
people like you
would consider them,

37:19.470 --> 37:21.470
I don't know, allies?

37:21.950 --> 37:24.870
After all, they'd have
the same goal as you, right?

37:25.230 --> 37:27.630
To stop Jordan Collier's
global revolution,

37:27.710 --> 37:30.030
and all the chaos
and unrest that it could bring.

37:30.270 --> 37:32.270
I'd just think of them
as back-up.

37:33.070 --> 37:34.270
Valuable back-up.

37:34.350 --> 37:35.350
If...

37:36.150 --> 37:37.630
- they exist.
- That's right.

37:38.270 --> 37:39.990
If they exist.

37:42.270 --> 37:44.230
Anyway, it was good
to see you two again.

37:44.310 --> 37:46.190
I have to pick up my wife.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.150
We're being honored
at the world

37:48.310 --> 37:49.990
health organization tonight.

37:51.790 --> 37:53.870
Those look like x-rays.
is everything okay with you?

37:56.110 --> 37:57.190
It didn't work.

37:57.990 --> 38:00.270
Whatever you tried to do to me,
it didn't take.

38:00.910 --> 38:02.030
I'm still me.

38:02.910 --> 38:04.270
Of course you're you.

38:05.230 --> 38:07.030
We're all ourselves, aren't we?

38:07.230 --> 38:10.270
I mean, who else would we be?

38:36.830 --> 38:38.510
He made you doubt me,
didn't he?

38:42.110 --> 38:43.670
Your cousin,
he made you doubt me.

38:44.910 --> 38:46.310
It's just weird timing,

38:47.190 --> 38:48.390
Hewitt's stroke.

38:50.190 --> 38:53.070
If you have something you want to
ask me, Kyle, I'll answer honestly.

38:55.910 --> 38:57.030
Was this you?

38:58.590 --> 38:59.750
Did you have this done?

39:00.830 --> 39:01.950
I did not.

39:04.630 --> 39:05.750
I believe you.

39:07.630 --> 39:09.030
I'm sorry Shawn didn't.

39:09.150 --> 39:10.230
I'm sorry, too.

39:11.670 --> 39:13.270
Shawn was like a son to me,

39:13.390 --> 39:14.350
and I've lost him.

39:17.070 --> 39:18.270
But I've found you.

39:49.550 --> 39:50.590
Thank you.

39:53.110 --> 39:54.710
Don't thank me, just change.

40:01.030 --> 40:02.550
I think we can rest easy.

40:02.630 --> 40:04.110
It's all going to be fine.

40:05.430 --> 40:07.990
Tell the others that I went to see
the NTAC agents.

40:10.430 --> 40:12.350
Baldwin thinks
it's some kind of ploy,

40:12.630 --> 40:13.830
a mind game...

40:17.710 --> 40:19.110
When we need him,

40:20.710 --> 40:22.110
he will be there for us.
