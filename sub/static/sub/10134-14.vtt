wedding at Graceland, won't you?

08:30.593 --> 08:33.972
Okay. Classy and elegant.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.974
Imagine yourself at Graceland.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.600
A luxurious, palatial estate

08:37.642 --> 08:41.438
of the late, great king

08:37.642 --> 08:41.438
of rock 'n roll, Elvis Presley.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.523
Where every corner

08:41.480 --> 08:43.523
oozes romance

08:43.564 --> 08:45.359
from the gold-plated

08:43.564 --> 08:45.359
racquetball courts

08:45.400 --> 08:47.735
to the newly astroturfed

08:45.400 --> 08:47.735
jungle room

08:47.777 --> 08:50.238
worth over nine zillion dollars.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.573
Picture it, picture it,

08:50.280 --> 08:52.573
picture it.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.870
[honking]

08:56.911 --> 08:58.413
(Jesse)

08:56.911 --> 08:58.413
'Where are you, darling?'

08:58.455 --> 09:00.999
Come out here, baby.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.999
Let me see you.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.583
Oh, yeah.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.628
You look like a hunk-a,

09:02.625 --> 09:05.628
hunk-a burning bride, baby.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.798
Jess, are you sure you

09:05.670 --> 09:08.798
like my hair like this?

09:08.840 --> 09:10.591
I can barely hold my head up.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.593
Oh, you look prettier

09:10.633 --> 09:12.593
than a fried peanut butter

09:12.635 --> 09:14.346
and 'nanner sandwich, Priscilla.

09:16.681 --> 09:20.601
Jess, my name

09:16.681 --> 09:20.601
is Rebecca.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.603
Sorry, 'scilla.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.899
Wise men say

09:22.645 --> 09:25.899
only fools rush in

09:25.940 --> 09:28.609
but I can't help

09:25.940 --> 09:28.609
falling in love with you, baby.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.573
Something doesn't feel right

09:31.612 --> 09:33.573
about this wedding.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.284
Yeah. You're absolutely

09:33.614 --> 09:36.284
right, Priscilla.

09:36.326 --> 09:37.702
That beehive ain't high enough.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.413
Let's jack that baby up

09:37.744 --> 09:39.413
a little bit.

09:39.454 --> 09:41.456
It's got to be fit for a king

09:39.454 --> 09:41.456
you know what I'm saying, baby?

09:41.498 --> 09:43.250
I think you do.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.295
Oh-h.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.425
Let's get a few things straight.

09:51.466 --> 09:54.010
My name is Rebecca,

09:51.466 --> 09:54.010
and I'm not getting married

09:54.052 --> 09:57.138
with a hairdo

09:54.052 --> 09:57.138
like Marge Simpson.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.181
- Marge Simpson?

09:57.180 --> 09:58.181
- Yes.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.224
What are you talking about?

09:59.266 --> 10:02.227
Okay, come on, you guys. Hey.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.520
Come on, that's enough.

10:03.562 --> 10:04.979
Listen, you're getting

10:03.562 --> 10:04.979
married real soon

10:05.021 --> 10:06.773
so you better learn

10:05.021 --> 10:06.773
to compromise.

10:06.814 --> 10:09.359
Now, call me

10:06.814 --> 10:09.359
totally nutty

10:09.401 --> 10:12.446
but what about having a wedding

10:09.401 --> 10:12.446
right here where you live?

10:12.487 --> 10:14.155
In San Francisco?

10:15.949 --> 10:18.243
Well, the kid's

10:15.949 --> 10:18.243
got something.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.453
I mean, this,

10:18.285 --> 10:19.453
this is where we met

10:19.494 --> 10:20.954
and this is where fell in love.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.997
Yeah, this is where

10:20.995 --> 10:22.997
all our friends are.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.707
- Let's do it.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.707
- Alright.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.335
And let's get married on the

10:24.749 --> 10:27.335
most romantic day of the year.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.963
Aw, perfect.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.963
Elvis' birthday.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.842
No. Valentine's day.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.470
Aw-w, I love it.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.349
Joey, thank you

10:39.264 --> 10:41.349
for all your help.

10:41.391 --> 10:42.934
You're welcome.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.852
Now would somebody

10:42.976 --> 10:44.852
please give me a credit card?

10:44.894 --> 10:49.232
If I call now, they'll throw in

10:44.894 --> 10:49.232
a free Bam-Bam's soap-on-a-rope.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.319
Oh, thanks, Fred.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.861
Ah ha ha.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.991
Oh, Jess, I feel so at peace

10:58.032 --> 10:59.700
now that we finally

10:58.032 --> 10:59.700
made this decision.

10:59.742 --> 11:03.830
Yeah. I can't believe we're

10:59.742 --> 11:03.830
getting married in six weeks.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.541
A-ah!

11:06.583 --> 11:08.335
Six weeks.

11:08.376 --> 11:09.836
We have a million things to do.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.421
Find a church, hire a hall

11:11.463 --> 11:12.880
buy a dress,

11:11.463 --> 11:12.880
pick out invitations

11:12.922 --> 11:14.466
a band, a caterer,

11:12.922 --> 11:14.466
cocktail napkins--

11:14.508 --> 11:17.636
- Becky, why don't we elope?

11:14.508 --> 11:17.636
- Oh, I don't know.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.471
Then we'd need

11:17.676 --> 11:19.471
a balcony, a ladder

11:19.513 --> 11:22.641
a getaway car,

11:19.513 --> 11:22.641
a flashlight.

11:25.477 --> 11:29.939
Come on, Anthony,

11:25.477 --> 11:29.939
smile for mommy. Please?

11:29.981 --> 11:33.360
Pretty please

11:29.981 --> 11:33.360
with ninja turtles on top?

11:35.445 --> 11:37.322
Just leave this to us

11:35.445 --> 11:37.322
professionals.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.739
Oh, happy helper.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.952
Here I am,

11:40.659 --> 11:42.952
happy to help.

11:42.994 --> 11:46.873
Great. Go get Anthony to give us

11:42.994 --> 11:46.873
a big tot-shot smile.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.626
Hi, Anthony.

11:49.668 --> 11:52.003
I'm DJ,

11:49.668 --> 11:52.003
the happy helper.

11:52.045 --> 11:55.840
Now, why don't you give me a big

11:52.045 --> 11:55.840
happy smile for your picture.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.551
No!

11:58.968 --> 12:02.556
Arr, mm-m, grrr.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.891
That's not funny.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.725
I know what you need.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.103
It's Howie the Hippo.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.147
Look at how he can zippo

12:11.189 --> 12:13.650
how he can flippo.

12:13.692 --> 12:16.403
I really feel like a dippo.

12:17.778 --> 12:20.739
That's not funny.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.576
Come on. I've had a rough week.

12:22.617 --> 12:25.036
Now, what can I do

12:22.617 --> 12:25.036
to make you laugh?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.913
Be a duck.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.792
Quack! Quack! Quack!

12:28.582 --> 12:31.792
Quack! Quack!

12:32.835 --> 12:35.004
Oh, what a beautiful child.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.590
Is that gonna be cash or charge?

12:36.631 --> 12:38.132
Check.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.301
Come on.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.097
Oh, happy helper.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.848
[chuckles]

12:45.890 --> 12:49.352
Kimmy, do you really have to by

12:45.890 --> 12:49.352
every day and laugh at me?

12:49.394 --> 12:51.812
I'm not laughing at you,

12:49.394 --> 12:51.812
I'm laughing with you

12:51.854 --> 12:54.773
only you're not joining in.

12:54.815 --> 12:56.234
Come on. Take a break.

12:56.276 --> 12:59.028
Those cute guys

12:56.276 --> 12:59.028
want to buy us pizza.

13:01.615 --> 13:04.451
I don't want anyone cute

13:01.615 --> 13:04.451
seeing me like this.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.160
What about after work?

13:06.202 --> 13:07.912
I have to go home, eat dinner

13:07.954 --> 13:09.372
and then try

13:07.954 --> 13:09.372
and stay awake long enough

13:09.414 --> 13:11.291
to study

13:09.414 --> 13:11.291
for my science test.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.875
Poor kid.

13:12.917 --> 13:16.170
You're working like a dog,

13:12.917 --> 13:16.170
and dressing like a dweeb.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.632
You must really want

13:16.212 --> 13:18.632
those "Blow-outs" bad.

13:18.673 --> 13:19.882
It's more than shoes.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.636
I'm trying to be

13:19.924 --> 13:22.636
a responsible adult.

13:22.677 --> 13:26.264
Then if I were you,

13:22.677 --> 13:26.264
I'd lose the clown suit.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.391
Come on, boys.

13:36.232 --> 13:39.986
Comet, it's not polite to beg.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.780
Now say "please."

13:41.820 --> 13:43.072
[dog barks]

13:45.408 --> 13:47.118
Very good, Comet.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.872
Hey, you forgot

13:49.203 --> 13:51.872
to say thank you.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.920
Good afternoon, ladies.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.381
Good afternoon, Michelle.

14:00.423 --> 14:01.508
Is dad home yet?

14:01.549 --> 14:04.636
No, but thank you

14:01.549 --> 14:04.636
for asking.

14:06.471 --> 14:09.349
Well, at least I'll stay out of

14:06.471 --> 14:09.349
trouble for a few more minutes.

14:09.390 --> 14:12.851
DJ, you don't have to show

14:09.390 --> 14:12.851
your dad that science test.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.270
Yes, I do.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.606
I promised him

14:14.312 --> 14:16.606
that I'd raise my grade.

14:16.648 --> 14:19.066
And he knows I'm getting

14:16.648 --> 14:19.066
my test back today.

14:19.108 --> 14:23.780
So when he sees this...I'm dead.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.951
The first F of my life.

14:28.993 --> 14:32.789
Excuse me, but no elbows

14:28.993 --> 14:32.789
on the table.

14:38.503 --> 14:41.548
When my dad finds out

14:38.503 --> 14:41.548
about this F

14:41.589 --> 14:44.342
he's gonna make me quit my job.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.720
You know,

14:44.384 --> 14:46.720
now that I look at it

14:46.761 --> 14:49.222
I don't think

14:46.761 --> 14:49.222
you got an F.

14:49.263 --> 14:54.143
I believe that you

14:49.263 --> 14:54.143
got an A.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.521
Kimmy, how could you do that?

14:56.563 --> 14:59.106
It's not polite to yell.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.319
Michelle, I have enough problems

15:00.734 --> 15:03.319
without the "polite police"

15:03.361 --> 15:04.654
on my tail.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.239
So just stay out of this.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.700
You forgot to say "please."

15:10.076 --> 15:12.036
That's it.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.037
This is not polite.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.372
This is not polite.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.667
This is not polite.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.544
Thank you.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.129
You are not welcome.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.425
[sighs]

15:23.172 --> 15:25.425
I have to go to work.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.051
You know, Kimmy,

15:25.466 --> 15:27.051
you really messed me up

15:27.093 --> 15:28.762
by giving me that A.

15:28.803 --> 15:30.722
Now I can't show it to my dad.

15:30.764 --> 15:33.600
Why not? It's a perfect forgery.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.518
Kimmy, don't you understand?

15:35.560 --> 15:37.103
What you did is wrong.

15:37.144 --> 15:40.481
It's dishonest,

15:37.144 --> 15:40.481
it's deceitful, it..

15:40.523 --> 15:42.316
...really does

15:40.523 --> 15:42.316
look like an A.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.112
Quack! Quack! Quack!

15:43.777 --> 15:46.112
Quack! Quack!

15:46.153 --> 15:49.949
Quack! Quack! Quack!

15:46.153 --> 15:49.949
Quack! Quack!

15:49.990 --> 15:51.743
[babies bawling]

15:53.620 --> 15:55.996
Smile, DJ.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.541
Oh, great.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.541
More humiliation.

15:58.583 --> 16:01.085
Excuse me.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.295
What are you guys doing here?

16:02.336 --> 16:03.421
Well, we were

16:02.336 --> 16:03.421
in the neighborhood

16:03.463 --> 16:04.631
and I had my camera.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.215
I thought we'd

16:04.672 --> 16:06.215
stop by to say "hi".

16:06.257 --> 16:08.802
- Hi.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.929
Well, thanks

16:08.843 --> 16:10.929
for stopping by.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.598
Do you know you have

16:10.970 --> 16:13.598
a mop on your head?

16:14.641 --> 16:17.477
Yes. It's part

16:14.641 --> 16:17.477
of my uniform.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.938
Can I borrow your uniform

16:17.518 --> 16:19.938
next Halloween?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.317
[sighs]

16:22.482 --> 16:24.317
Well, I should get back to work.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.903
Well, before we go, if I'm not

16:24.358 --> 16:26.903
mistaken and I'm not

16:26.945 --> 16:29.906
wasn't your science test

16:26.945 --> 16:29.906
due back today? How'd you do?

16:29.948 --> 16:31.282
I really should

16:29.948 --> 16:31.282
get back to work.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.534
Come on, Deej.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.534
Tell me how you did.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.328
Did you bring

16:33.576 --> 16:35.328
the test paper with you?

16:35.369 --> 16:37.997
Yeah. I'll show you

16:38.038 --> 16:40.583
but there's something

16:38.038 --> 16:40.583
I should really tell you.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.503
You got an A?

16:43.544 --> 16:45.004
Way to go.

16:45.045 --> 16:47.674
This is going right up

16:45.045 --> 16:47.674
there on the refrigerator.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.383
Dad, this isn't--

16:49.425 --> 16:52.136
You know, sweety, I'm a little

16:49.425 --> 16:52.136
embarrassed to tell you this.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.764
But I had my doubts

16:52.178 --> 16:54.764
about you

16:54.806 --> 16:56.641
but you just proved to me that

16:54.806 --> 16:56.641
you could hold on a job

16:56.683 --> 16:59.268
and actually improve

16:56.683 --> 16:59.268
on your schoolwork.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.855
I've never been

16:59.310 --> 17:01.855
so proud of you, sweetheart.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.439
Now, what was it

17:01.896 --> 17:03.439
you wanted to tell me?

17:03.481 --> 17:07.652
Uh, there's a sale on sponges

17:03.481 --> 17:07.652
down at Broom Barn.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.237
Oh, what beautiful

17:08.653 --> 17:10.237
children.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.865
Can I help

17:10.279 --> 17:11.865
you people?

17:11.906 --> 17:13.533
You're not gonna believe this,

17:11.906 --> 17:13.533
we had no intention

17:13.574 --> 17:15.034
of having any pictures taken

17:15.075 --> 17:16.953
but your bright young assistant

17:15.075 --> 17:16.953
here convinced me

17:16.995 --> 17:19.246
to get some shots of my sweet

17:16.995 --> 17:19.246
little Michelle over there.

17:19.288 --> 17:22.709
What a fine fine salesperson

17:19.288 --> 17:22.709
you have in this young lady.

17:22.750 --> 17:26.004
Okay, happy helper,

17:22.750 --> 17:26.004
start happy helping.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.672
Okay, little girl

17:27.714 --> 17:30.341
you're gonna get

17:27.714 --> 17:30.341
your picture taken.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.013
I've got to tell you that bright

17:32.552 --> 17:35.013
young lady in the clown costume

17:35.054 --> 17:36.597
she is fabulous.

17:36.639 --> 17:38.725
Better give her a raise.

17:36.639 --> 17:38.725
Uh, what the heck do I know?

17:38.766 --> 17:41.561
I've never seen her

17:38.766 --> 17:41.561
before in my life.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.479
Say cheese.

17:43.521 --> 17:47.025
You mean, "say cheese, please."

17:47.066 --> 17:49.068
Say cheese, please.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.406
- Cheese.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.406
- This is amazing.

17:53.447 --> 17:56.951
My sweet little Michelle has

17:53.447 --> 17:56.951
never smiled in her entire life.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.704
Cheese.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.206
Cheese.

18:09.047 --> 18:11.632
May I have

18:09.047 --> 18:11.632
that cupcake, please?

18:11.674 --> 18:13.384
No, you may not.

18:13.426 --> 18:17.013
But I was polite,

18:13.426 --> 18:17.013
and I said, "please."

18:17.055 --> 18:18.347
I was polite, too.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.934
I said, "no, you may not."

18:20.975 --> 18:22.476
Guess what?

18:24.353 --> 18:26.731
Politeness week is over.

18:28.691 --> 18:31.444
'How rude!'

18:37.366 --> 18:38.618
Whoa.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.914
Whoa.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.127
Whoa.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.088
Hey, Deej.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.672
Hi, Uncle Jesse.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.260
See you got an A here

18:53.758 --> 18:56.260
on your science.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.720
It was nothing.

18:57.762 --> 19:00.431
Let's hear what an A paper

18:57.762 --> 19:00.431
sounds like, shall we?

19:01.891 --> 19:03.183
"Photosynthesis."

19:03.225 --> 19:04.769
"Photosynthesis

19:03.225 --> 19:04.769
is the process

19:04.811 --> 19:06.771
in which photos

19:04.811 --> 19:06.771
are synthesized."

19:08.898 --> 19:11.818
Hmm, I wonder what

19:08.898 --> 19:11.818
an F paper looks like.

19:11.859 --> 19:16.196
Oh, well, actually maybe it

19:11.859 --> 19:16.196
looks something like this.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.157
How did you know?

19:18.198 --> 19:20.493
How did I know? Huh!

19:20.534 --> 19:23.454
You're talking to a guy who used

19:20.534 --> 19:23.454
to changed forties to nineties.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.917
Zeroes to hundreds.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.917
In fact this is beautiful.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.376
One time I actually

19:27.959 --> 19:29.376
got away with changing

19:29.418 --> 19:31.170
the word "awful" to "awesome."

19:31.211 --> 19:33.380
It was..

19:33.422 --> 19:34.632
The point is,

19:33.422 --> 19:34.632
it was wrong.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.134
It was wrong.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.134
The point is it was wrong.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.551
And what you did

19:36.175 --> 19:37.551
was wrong too.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.303
Same thing, wrong.

19:39.345 --> 19:42.056
I know, but Kimmy was

19:39.345 --> 19:42.056
the one who changed the grade.

19:42.098 --> 19:45.143
Yes, but you didn't do anything

19:42.098 --> 19:45.143
about it now, did you?

19:45.184 --> 19:47.645
So, you know what you have to do

19:45.184 --> 19:47.645
with this paper, don't you?

19:48.896 --> 19:51.024
Keep my mouth shut,

19:48.896 --> 19:51.024
and do better next time?

19:53.651 --> 19:55.402
Where's dad?

19:55.444 --> 19:58.781
He's in the living room.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.781
Rotating couch cushions.

20:05.830 --> 20:06.914
Hi, dad.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.916
Hey, Deej.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.916
Here's a helpful hint.

20:08.958 --> 20:12.086
Always rotate your couch

20:08.958 --> 20:12.086
cushions every 25,000 sits.

20:13.379 --> 20:14.714
Dad, we need to talk.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.843
You know what I like

20:16.716 --> 20:18.843
about you best?

20:18.885 --> 20:21.220
My charm,

20:18.885 --> 20:21.220
my rugged good looks?

20:21.261 --> 20:23.181
Your forgiving nature.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.432
What did you do?

20:25.474 --> 20:26.976
Here goes.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.853
My science grade

20:27.018 --> 20:28.853
was an F

20:28.895 --> 20:31.064
and Kimmy changed it

20:28.895 --> 20:31.064
to an A.

20:32.815 --> 20:36.610
I'm just guessing she doesn't

20:32.815 --> 20:36.610
have the authority to do this.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.987
Dad, I'm sorry.

20:38.029 --> 20:39.697
But with work

20:38.029 --> 20:39.697
and all my other classes

20:39.739 --> 20:42.700
I didn't have time

20:39.739 --> 20:42.700
to study for my science test.

20:42.742 --> 20:46.037
Then you should come to me

20:42.742 --> 20:46.037
and told me what was going on.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.206
DJ, we had an understanding.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.665
You wanted to be

20:48.247 --> 20:49.665
a responsible adult

20:49.707 --> 20:51.042
and this is the least

20:49.707 --> 20:51.042
responsible thing

20:51.084 --> 20:52.585
you could've done.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.921
I just wanted to prove

20:52.626 --> 20:54.921
that I could earn my own money.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.463
Well, that's all

20:54.962 --> 20:56.463
out the window now.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.216
Because you're going to

20:56.505 --> 20:58.216
have to quit your job

20:58.257 --> 21:01.427
and no hanging out at the mall

20:58.257 --> 21:01.427
until you pull up that grade.

21:01.468 --> 21:05.305
Okay. Guess I'll go back

21:01.468 --> 21:05.305
to being a kid again.

21:06.766 --> 21:11.353
Deej...there's nothing wrong

21:06.766 --> 21:11.353
with being a kid.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.022
You should enjoy it.

21:13.064 --> 21:16.234
You got the rest of

21:13.064 --> 21:16.234
your life to be an adult.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.153
Well, I guess if being an adult

21:16.275 --> 21:19.153
means wearing a red mop

21:19.195 --> 21:22.531
on my head, I could handle being

21:19.195 --> 21:22.531
a kid a little longer.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.158
[chuckles]

21:24.200 --> 21:27.870
In case I forgot to mention it,

21:24.200 --> 21:27.870
you're a pretty great kid.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.705
Thanks, dad.

21:33.292 --> 21:37.671
[sighs]

21:33.292 --> 21:37.671
Well, I guess this is my first

21:33.292 --> 21:37.671
and last paycheck.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.884
You're gonna use it to help pay

21:39.132 --> 21:41.884
for those "Blow-outs"?

21:41.926 --> 21:43.094
Are you kidding?

21:43.136 --> 21:46.180
Pay $160 for shoes?

21:46.222 --> 21:48.141
Do you know how much

21:46.222 --> 21:48.141
quacking and waddling

21:48.182 --> 21:50.517
I had to do to earn this money?

21:50.559 --> 21:52.186
It's going in the bank.

21:52.228 --> 21:53.604
That's good news.

21:53.646 --> 21:56.065
Sounds like you're learning

21:53.646 --> 21:56.065
the value of a dollar.

21:56.107 --> 21:59.359
I am, and I appreciate

21:56.107 --> 21:59.359
how you're going to feel

21:59.401 --> 22:01.237
when I ask you this.

22:01.279 --> 22:03.030
Dad, can I have a raise

22:01.279 --> 22:03.030
in my allowance?

22:03.072 --> 22:04.573
You know honey,

22:03.072 --> 22:04.573
back to those couch cushions--

22:04.615 --> 22:06.742
Things are really expensive

22:04.615 --> 22:06.742
these days, you know.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.410
The fluffiness

22:06.784 --> 22:08.410
a pillow must have.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.454
A dollar's not

22:08.452 --> 22:10.454
a dollar anymore.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.292
♪ Aah aah aah aah ♪

22:34.270 --> 22:38.065
♪ Aah aah aah aah ♪

22:38.107 --> 22:40.442
♪ Do-be-da-ba-ba-da ♪♪
