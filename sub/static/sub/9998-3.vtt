<i>The man wearing the mask is,</i>
<i>um, is raping the girl.</i>

00:07.945 --> 00:10.297
I'm almost certain
that's your brother.

00:10.381 --> 00:12.116
You raped her, didn't you,
you fat weasel?

00:12.183 --> 00:13.467
I didn't do it!

00:13.551 --> 00:15.568
Admit what you did,
I will stand by you.

00:15.637 --> 00:17.504
I'll get you help.

00:17.589 --> 00:19.122
I don't need help.

00:19.174 --> 00:21.842
I don't want help.

00:21.926 --> 00:23.560
KIRA:
You deserve this.

00:23.628 --> 00:25.729
You know that.

00:27.565 --> 00:29.316
She's going after
your brother.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.268
I just saw it, Lee.

00:31.319 --> 00:32.636
Okay, we've got it covered,
Allison.

00:32.686 --> 00:34.605
If Kira goes after Paul,
we'll pick her up.

00:39.744 --> 00:42.246
ALLISON:
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

00:42.313 --> 00:44.014
Please just tell me
everything's all right with you.

00:44.082 --> 00:46.517
Paul's dead, Allison.

00:46.584 --> 00:48.702
She got to him
before we could stop her.

00:54.192 --> 00:55.792
(birds chirping)

00:55.860 --> 00:58.529
BOY:
Dad's gonna kill me.

00:58.596 --> 01:02.132
Why? What'd you do
now, Mr. Good?

01:02.200 --> 01:05.669
I was in the garage
playing with Dad's tools,

01:05.720 --> 01:07.721
just looking at them, you know.

01:07.805 --> 01:11.775
And I picked up
the new ball-peen hammer.

01:11.842 --> 01:13.694
Well, it kind
of hit the Buick

01:13.778 --> 01:16.730
and made a big scratch.

01:16.814 --> 01:19.233
FATHER (yells):
Where the hell did
this scratch come from?!

01:19.317 --> 01:22.202
You kids hear me?!

01:22.270 --> 01:24.488
I know it must
have been one of ya!

01:24.556 --> 01:27.157
Who did this?!

01:30.228 --> 01:31.411
I did.

01:32.964 --> 01:34.331
What are you doing?

01:34.382 --> 01:35.716
It was me.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.417
I did it.

01:37.502 --> 01:39.869
I was the one
who ruined our car.

01:39.921 --> 01:41.255
All right,
get in here.

01:41.339 --> 01:42.573
Take what's
coming to you.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.508
Stop.

01:44.559 --> 01:47.094
Why are you doing this?

01:47.178 --> 01:48.929
Why not?

01:49.013 --> 01:51.732
I'm better at taking
a smack than you are.

01:53.735 --> 01:57.020
Pauly Scanlon, when I say
get your ass in here,

01:57.071 --> 01:59.156
I mean now!

02:02.026 --> 02:03.226
MAN:
You don't listen!

02:03.278 --> 02:04.561
You don't
listen, damn it!

02:04.612 --> 02:06.496
This is why he
doesn't listen!

02:06.564 --> 02:07.664
Get up here.

02:07.732 --> 02:09.366
I've had it
with you, Eric!

02:09.417 --> 02:11.518
Nice dream, huh?

02:11.586 --> 02:13.787
Nice memory.

02:13.855 --> 02:15.005
MAN:
You understand me?!
Get up here!

02:15.073 --> 02:16.673
How you doing?
You holding up okay?

02:16.741 --> 02:17.824
Get up here!
Stand up!

02:17.892 --> 02:19.075
I know I haven't
let you sleep much

02:19.127 --> 02:20.427
the past week or so.

02:20.511 --> 02:23.297
What can I tell you?
You know what
I ought to do?!

02:23.364 --> 02:25.749
Sleep is for pansies.

02:25.817 --> 02:27.935
MAN:
Get out of the way! Huh?

02:28.019 --> 02:30.220
(man yelling)
WOMAN:
Hey, don't grab him!

02:30.271 --> 02:31.921
Don't grab him!
(screams)

02:31.973 --> 02:34.141
MAN:
Shut your mouth!

02:34.225 --> 02:35.892
Stay down!

02:35.944 --> 02:37.561
Whoa, whoa, wait a second,
Mr. Good.

02:37.612 --> 02:39.262
You sure you want
to go in there?

02:39.314 --> 02:41.198
You haven't had enough sleep.

02:41.266 --> 02:42.833
(man shouting,
blows landing)

02:42.900 --> 02:45.452
Your judgment's not
what it should be.

02:45.536 --> 02:46.603
(loud knocking)

02:46.654 --> 02:47.955
What do you want?

02:48.039 --> 02:49.239
Remember me?

02:49.290 --> 02:50.958
I was here last week.

02:51.042 --> 02:53.293
Yeah, I know.
My wife called the cops.

02:53.378 --> 02:54.661
But that was last week.

02:54.746 --> 02:56.630
Some reason you're
here tonight?

02:58.115 --> 02:59.833
I don't like you.

03:02.003 --> 03:04.004
You guys okay?

03:04.088 --> 03:06.006
Hey! Nobody invited
you in here.

03:06.123 --> 03:07.507
This is America, man.

03:07.592 --> 03:10.344
Cops can't just bust into
your house for no reason.

03:10.428 --> 03:11.628
(bones cracking)
I got a reason.

03:11.679 --> 03:13.680
How about I know
the second I turn my back,

03:13.765 --> 03:16.767
I know you're going to beat him
and torture her?!

03:16.818 --> 03:18.318
How about that?!

03:18.403 --> 03:19.803
(groans)

03:22.357 --> 03:23.974
(man grunting in pain)

03:24.042 --> 03:26.193

JOE:
You okay?

03:32.983 --> 03:34.651
You all right?

03:34.702 --> 03:38.372
Yeah. Just had a dream. Just...

03:38.456 --> 03:40.007
A crazy dream.

03:40.091 --> 03:43.493
JOE:
What are you doing now?

03:43.544 --> 03:46.296
Nothing. It's crazy.

03:48.166 --> 03:50.550
There, see? I'm done.

Lee, you got a text.

04:19.414 --> 04:21.081
It's Allison.

04:21.165 --> 04:23.800
She wants to know
if you're okay.

04:26.554 --> 04:27.871
Uh...

04:27.922 --> 04:31.091
Yeah, sure.
Text her I'm fine.

Hello.

05:29.899 --> 05:31.199
WOMAN:
Is this Ariel Dubois?

05:32.212 --> 05:33.295
Oh, Did I wake you?

05:33.318 --> 05:34.001
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:34.014 --> 05:36.549
I knew I should have waited
another hour before I called.

05:37.458 --> 05:39.959
Who is this?

05:40.027 --> 05:41.044
Guess who just called?

05:41.128 --> 05:42.929
ALLISON:
You're still not dressed.

05:42.980 --> 05:44.297
I thought I told you--

05:44.364 --> 05:45.931
if you wanted to drive
Daddy's car today,

05:45.983 --> 05:49.185
that you had to be up and ready
to take Daddy and the girls at 7:45.

05:49.244 --> 05:50.627
I just talked
to my roommate.

05:50.695 --> 05:52.479
My college roommate.

05:52.564 --> 05:54.164
She just called me.

05:54.215 --> 05:56.233
She's from Texas.
Her name is Melissa,

05:56.300 --> 05:57.918
and she sounds really nice.

05:58.002 --> 06:00.437
Your college roommate?

06:00.504 --> 06:02.456
This is really
happening, isn't it?

06:02.524 --> 06:04.908
Well, congratulations, honey.

06:04.959 --> 06:07.844
I didn't even know that
they'd already assigned
rooms and roommates.

06:07.912 --> 06:09.279
I know. Me neither.

06:09.364 --> 06:12.516
But she got a letter yesterday
with my name and phone number.

06:12.584 --> 06:13.967
So I should be getting
one today.

06:14.052 --> 06:15.419
And she had
this really great idea

06:15.486 --> 06:17.754
that maybe instead of us
flying out to New Hampshire

06:17.805 --> 06:20.274
in two weeks, we could take
the money and use it

06:20.341 --> 06:22.209
to buy a car
and drive it out there.

06:23.811 --> 06:25.796
I mean a used car.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.831
BRIDGETTE:
This is my favorite part,

06:27.899 --> 06:31.635
where you say something so dumb
that no one knows what to say.

06:31.703 --> 06:34.054
Gonna miss this.

06:34.122 --> 06:35.606
A used car?
Drive out there?

06:35.673 --> 06:36.940
What are you
talking about?

06:36.991 --> 06:39.092
Why would we
want to do that?

06:39.177 --> 06:40.494
This is your roommate's idea?

06:40.562 --> 06:41.962
She doesn't have
a car either,

06:42.046 --> 06:44.448
and Dartmouth is kind of
in the middle of nowhere.

06:44.515 --> 06:46.967
So she thought if I had one,
she could pay for insurance

06:47.035 --> 06:48.435
and we could split the gas.

06:48.519 --> 06:49.570
That's very generous of her,

06:49.637 --> 06:50.837
letting you buy it and all.

06:50.905 --> 06:53.006
We're not doing it.

06:53.091 --> 06:54.541
But we already went online,

06:54.609 --> 06:56.510
started looking for used car
deals around here.

06:56.594 --> 06:58.328
I mean, they're actually
quite reasonable.

06:58.396 --> 06:59.513
No.

06:59.597 --> 07:01.281
Go on, go get dressed.

07:01.366 --> 07:04.901
Or I'm taking the girls
to school and myself to work.

07:04.969 --> 07:06.920
(elevator bell dings)

07:17.181 --> 07:19.232
MAN:
<i>This is America, man.</i>

07:19.317 --> 07:21.201
Cops can't just bust into
your house for no reason.

07:21.269 --> 07:22.352
(bones cracking)

07:22.403 --> 07:24.371
(elevator bell dings)

07:27.025 --> 07:27.924
We are going to
follow the process.

07:27.992 --> 07:29.076
Thank you very much
for coming in.

07:29.160 --> 07:33.246
Trust me.
Tell your boy
he's done. Done!

07:33.314 --> 07:35.198
Got it?

07:39.420 --> 07:42.372
(knocking on door)

07:42.440 --> 07:44.958
Do you mind if I ask you
what that was all about?

07:45.043 --> 07:47.828
An unhappy citizen,
I'm afraid.

07:47.895 --> 07:49.479
He's sworn out a complaint

07:49.547 --> 07:51.048
against our friend
Detective Scanlon.

07:51.115 --> 07:53.684
Seems there was some sort
of domestic violence incident

07:53.751 --> 07:55.335
at his home a week ago.

07:55.420 --> 07:57.454
Lee was the responding officer.

07:57.522 --> 07:59.756
According to him, Lee showed up
at his home again last night

07:59.824 --> 08:01.274
for no apparent reason,

08:01.342 --> 08:03.243
entered his house
completely uninvited

08:03.328 --> 08:06.997
and proceeded
to physically assault Mr....

08:07.064 --> 08:08.031
Laurence Raymond

08:08.099 --> 08:10.567
in front of his wife
and child.

08:10.618 --> 08:13.720
And now he wants
the good people of Phoenix

08:13.788 --> 08:16.840
to pay him for his pain
and anguish.

08:16.908 --> 08:20.010
And could they also please throw
that nasty Detective Scanlon

08:20.094 --> 08:21.645
off the force and into jail.

08:21.713 --> 08:23.997
Wow.

08:24.065 --> 08:27.067
So what happens now?

08:27.135 --> 08:28.819
Unfortunately, we have to go
through the charade

08:28.886 --> 08:30.554
of holding
a police trial board hearing.

08:30.621 --> 08:32.039
What do you mean charade?

08:32.106 --> 08:34.541
Mr. Raymond is no stranger
to the justice system

08:34.625 --> 08:35.892
here in Phoenix.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.994
He's got a rap sheet going back
over two decades.

08:38.046 --> 08:40.347
Now I'm not saying
that I don't believe him,

08:40.431 --> 08:42.082
but he wouldn't be
the first criminal

08:42.166 --> 08:43.750
with a grudge to have someone
beat him up

08:43.818 --> 08:45.869
and then claim a cop did it.

08:45.936 --> 08:48.822
I just resent the hoops
that we're all going to have

08:48.890 --> 08:51.174
to jump through
to make this go away.

08:51.225 --> 08:52.943
What do you mean?
What kind of hoops?

08:53.010 --> 08:55.829
Well, I'm sure Lee's going
to want me to defend him,

08:55.913 --> 08:58.165
friends like you to testify
on his behalf.

08:58.249 --> 09:01.184
It's... it's a lot of work,
a lot of time.

09:01.252 --> 09:04.104
These trial boards
are no cakewalk.

09:04.188 --> 09:06.807
It's pretty much a given that
they're going to bring up

09:06.874 --> 09:09.276
Lee's past substance
abuse problems.

09:09.343 --> 09:13.080
He's going to need
every positive character
witness he can get.

09:13.164 --> 09:16.616
I'm assuming he--
we-- can count on you?

09:17.652 --> 09:20.603
Of course.

09:36.537 --> 09:37.738
(loud thud, Ariel gasps)

09:37.822 --> 09:39.923
(muffled yelling)

09:49.550 --> 09:50.584
Yes?

09:50.668 --> 09:52.769
Uh...

09:52.820 --> 09:53.837
Can I help you?

09:53.888 --> 09:56.223
I'm sorry.

09:56.307 --> 09:59.760
Um... I'm looking for Rebecca.

09:59.844 --> 10:02.612
Is this a joke?

10:02.680 --> 10:04.464
Uh, no.

10:04.532 --> 10:07.267
I'm here about this ad.
About her car.

10:09.303 --> 10:12.989
When did you see this?
When did you speak to her?

10:13.057 --> 10:15.625
I... I didn't speak to her.

10:15.693 --> 10:17.928
A friend and I saw it
this morning online.

10:17.995 --> 10:20.430
My daughter hasn't
been home in three days.

10:20.481 --> 10:21.882
She or the car.

10:21.966 --> 10:24.351
You wouldn't happen to know
where she is, would you?

10:24.435 --> 10:29.372
No. Like I said, I, uh, I just
saw the ad online this morning.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.341
Sam, this girl doesn't
know Rebecca.

10:31.392 --> 10:32.909
You don't need
to grill her.

10:32.977 --> 10:34.444
I've got the police
on the phone.

10:34.512 --> 10:36.279
Why don't you go take over
for me.

10:36.330 --> 10:38.215
Tell them what you know.
I'll deal with this. It's okay.

10:38.266 --> 10:40.167
It's okay.

10:42.420 --> 10:43.436
Sorry about that.

10:43.504 --> 10:44.771
It's just really bad timing.

10:44.856 --> 10:47.107
We don't know where
Rebecca is at the moment,

10:47.175 --> 10:48.892
much less her car.

10:48.959 --> 10:51.027
I'm so sorry.

10:53.898 --> 10:56.016
I better get back in there.

10:56.083 --> 10:57.317
No, I-I understand.

10:57.401 --> 11:00.036
I just hope she turns up soon.

11:00.087 --> 11:01.404
Thanks.

11:07.094 --> 11:09.179
(loud thud, muffled yelling)

11:09.230 --> 11:11.481
(muffled yelling)

11:11.532 --> 11:13.517
(muffled yelling continues)

11:15.486 --> 11:17.137
Sorry, but I don't really
see the problem here.

11:17.221 --> 11:18.905
All they're gonna ask you
is whether you think

11:18.973 --> 11:20.056
Scanlon is a good cop.

11:20.107 --> 11:21.741
And all you got to say
is that you think

11:21.826 --> 11:22.776
Scanlon <i>is</i> a good cop.

11:22.844 --> 11:24.094
No, I know.

11:24.161 --> 11:26.713
But what, I just ignore
the rest of it?

11:26.781 --> 11:28.231
I mean, he's telling everybody

11:28.282 --> 11:30.183
that he never put a glove
on that guy,

11:30.268 --> 11:32.652
and I saw him beat
the hell out of him.

11:32.737 --> 11:35.338
No, you didn't see him
do anything.

11:35.406 --> 11:36.823
And you can't be certain

11:36.891 --> 11:38.091
whose thoughts
or impressions

11:38.175 --> 11:40.193
or imaginings
you might have
been channeling.

11:40.278 --> 11:42.245
And that's an important
distinction.

11:42.313 --> 11:44.881
Nobody actually saw
him do anything

11:44.949 --> 11:47.767
other than this guy and
supposedly his wife and kid,

11:47.852 --> 11:50.820
who are by no means unbiased.

11:50.888 --> 11:53.073
ARIEL:
Mom?

11:53.140 --> 11:55.609
I need to talk to you
about something.

11:55.676 --> 11:57.027
Look, I know that

11:57.078 --> 11:59.862
you and Dad told me not to even
go over there, but I went

11:59.914 --> 12:03.366
and I think that something bad
happened to her, okay?

12:03.434 --> 12:05.468
I think that somebody took her.

12:05.536 --> 12:07.070
Okay, we'll make some calls.

12:07.121 --> 12:09.839
I've been looking for an excuse
to call Lee.

12:09.907 --> 12:11.324
Maybe this is it.

12:12.426 --> 12:14.344
(phone rings)

12:14.412 --> 12:15.845
Mmm...

12:19.617 --> 12:21.284
Hello.

12:21.352 --> 12:22.852
MELISSA:
Oh, no.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.538
Did I seriously wake you up
twice in one day?

12:25.606 --> 12:29.576
Melissa? Is that you?

12:29.644 --> 12:32.228
It's, like, the middle
of the night in Texas.

12:32.296 --> 12:34.297
Sorry. I'm just a night owl,

12:34.365 --> 12:37.100
and I figured if you didn't want
to answer the phone,

12:37.168 --> 12:38.335
you wouldn't leave it on.

12:38.402 --> 12:40.303
And besides, I wanted
to hear about your day.

12:40.371 --> 12:43.907
My day turned out pretty weird,
actually.

12:43.975 --> 12:46.843
But how about I call you back
tomorrow

12:46.911 --> 12:49.079
and tell you all about it?

12:49.146 --> 12:51.281
Not now?

12:51.349 --> 12:53.900
I'm half asleep. (chuckles)

12:53.968 --> 12:58.872
Um, uh, give me your number

12:58.956 --> 13:00.724
'cause it doesn't come up
when you call.

13:00.791 --> 13:04.594
And I didn't get my roommate
letter from Dartmouth today.

13:07.648 --> 13:09.299
Melissa?

13:09.367 --> 13:12.402
Sorry. I thought I heard
something outside of my house.

13:12.453 --> 13:13.920
I guess it was nothing.

13:13.988 --> 13:14.921
(glass breaks)

13:14.989 --> 13:15.989
What was that?

13:16.057 --> 13:17.840
Oh, my God!
I think someone's trying

13:17.892 --> 13:19.092
to break into my house!

13:19.176 --> 13:21.511
Go away!
Melissa, can you see
who it is?

13:21.562 --> 13:23.697
I told you that I don't want
to see you!

13:23.781 --> 13:25.649
Hang up with me
and call the police.

13:25.716 --> 13:28.151
Melissa? Are you still there?
Can you hear me?

13:28.218 --> 13:29.619
(crashing sounds,
Melissa screams)

13:29.670 --> 13:31.037
Melissa! Melissa!

13:31.122 --> 13:32.622
(disconnected phone beeping)

13:32.673 --> 13:35.075
(distraught):
But how are you
supposed to find her?

13:35.142 --> 13:38.111
It's not like I have
her address or anything.

13:38.195 --> 13:40.013
Honey, Aurora
is a small town.

13:40.097 --> 13:42.782
The police will know
where she lives.

13:42.850 --> 13:43.950
Any luck?

13:44.018 --> 13:46.086
Do the police know
who Melissa was?

13:46.153 --> 13:49.356
Are they gonna send somebody
by her house to look?

13:49.423 --> 13:52.675
Absolutely. The Aurora police
knew exactly who she was.

13:52.727 --> 13:54.344
Honor roll student,

13:54.412 --> 13:56.096
getting ready
to go off to Dartmouth.

13:56.163 --> 13:59.766
Someone like that's pretty
conspicuous in a small town.

13:59.850 --> 14:01.634
But I don't think they're gonna
be sending somebody

14:01.702 --> 14:03.186
over to her house
to take a look.

14:03.254 --> 14:04.704
What are you saying?

14:04.772 --> 14:06.690
Why not?
Why wouldn't they?

14:06.757 --> 14:10.727
Because Melissa Drake's dead.

14:10.794 --> 14:12.979
She has been for 11 years.

14:13.047 --> 14:14.881
What?

14:23.036 --> 14:24.670
(phone beeps)

14:26.028 --> 14:29.680
(groggy):
What are you doing?

14:29.748 --> 14:33.601
Are you waiting on a call
from some deceased alumni

14:33.669 --> 14:35.870
from our old alma mater?

14:35.938 --> 14:37.872
Mmm.

14:37.940 --> 14:40.091
Just checking to see
if Lee called me back.

14:40.159 --> 14:41.492
Lee?

14:41.543 --> 14:43.861
Yeah, I called him earlier

14:43.929 --> 14:46.264
about that girl that Ariel's
worried about.

14:46.331 --> 14:47.548
You know, the first one.

14:47.616 --> 14:50.051
The one that hasn't been dead
for 11 years.

14:50.119 --> 14:51.919
Thank you for that.

14:52.004 --> 14:55.089
It's very hard
to keep the dead women
straight around here.

14:55.174 --> 14:57.041
That's not funny.

14:57.109 --> 15:00.762
He didn't call me back.

15:00.829 --> 15:03.214
I never see him
around the office anymore.

15:03.281 --> 15:05.283
He doesn't return my texts.

15:05.350 --> 15:06.750
I haven't even spoken with him

15:06.802 --> 15:08.469
since I had that awful dream
about him.

15:08.537 --> 15:10.788
Allison, it's the
middle of the night.

15:10.839 --> 15:12.473
Do you honestly expect
him to call you

15:12.541 --> 15:13.875
in the middle
of the night?

15:13.942 --> 15:18.029
No, I know. I just thought...

15:18.097 --> 15:21.916
I thought maybe I could
at least write him an e-mail.

15:25.421 --> 15:27.405
But I won't.

15:30.810 --> 15:32.377
YOUNG PAUL:
<i>I'm sorry!</i>
(belt lashing)

15:32.461 --> 15:33.862
I'm sorry!

15:33.913 --> 15:35.730
FATHER:
What do you say?

15:35.798 --> 15:37.332
(belt lashing,
Young Paul grunts)

15:37.400 --> 15:38.599
If you're really sorry,
then say it

15:38.651 --> 15:39.884
without that smirk on your face!

15:39.969 --> 15:42.303
YOUNG PAUL (grunts):
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

15:42.355 --> 15:44.456
But I'm not! Oh!
(belt lashing)

15:44.540 --> 15:47.208
(belt lashing,
Young Paul cries out)

15:47.276 --> 15:49.244
(grunts)

15:49.311 --> 15:51.262
(panting)

15:52.331 --> 15:53.798
What's the matter,
Mr. Good?

15:53.866 --> 15:56.284
Can't sleep?

15:56.335 --> 15:58.586
(door opens)

16:00.156 --> 16:02.424
(hushed):
Honey, what are you doing up?

16:02.491 --> 16:04.659
I saw your light on.
It's 2:00 in the morning.

16:04.727 --> 16:06.294
Can't sleep.

16:06.345 --> 16:09.748
Reading about Melissa Drake.

16:09.815 --> 16:10.832
What about you?

16:10.900 --> 16:12.050
What are you doing up?

16:12.118 --> 16:13.885
I don't know.

16:13.969 --> 16:15.153
Something's on my mind.

16:15.237 --> 16:18.256
I went to the kitchen,
wrote a e-mail.

16:21.861 --> 16:24.446
She was about to start
Dartmouth...

16:24.513 --> 16:27.415
just like me.

16:27.483 --> 16:28.883
And when they found her,

16:28.951 --> 16:30.735
she still had her phone
in her hand.

16:30.820 --> 16:32.454
The police thought
that maybe she was trying

16:32.521 --> 16:33.654
to call for help.

16:33.706 --> 16:37.008
I don't get it.

16:37.076 --> 16:38.977
This happened 11 years ago.

16:39.061 --> 16:41.279
So why was she calling me
tonight?

16:41.347 --> 16:44.215
I don't know, sweetie.

16:46.035 --> 16:48.703
You realize what you're saying
is crazy, right?

16:48.754 --> 16:50.405
MAN:
I don't think so.

16:50.472 --> 16:52.257
I don't think being
honest with someone

16:52.324 --> 16:54.859
about how you
feel is crazy.

16:54.944 --> 16:56.561
I'm going to college in a week.

16:56.629 --> 16:58.063
I'm packing my trunk.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.147
I'm selling my car.

16:59.214 --> 17:02.100
I love you,
Rebecca.

17:02.168 --> 17:03.952
You're twice my age.

17:04.002 --> 17:05.787
And you're my uncle.

17:05.855 --> 17:08.123
If you could just
listen to me, just...

17:08.190 --> 17:09.773
put off
going to school.

17:09.858 --> 17:11.376
Give us a chance!

17:11.460 --> 17:12.694
Us?

17:12.744 --> 17:16.013
There is no us.

17:16.082 --> 17:18.183
I need to call my mom.

17:21.270 --> 17:22.837
Rebecca...

17:22.887 --> 17:24.723
♪ ♪

17:24.807 --> 17:28.358
(grunts, gasping)

17:28.444 --> 17:31.246
(muffled yelling)

17:31.313 --> 17:33.965
(gasps, wheezing)

17:37.015 --> 17:38.249
(phone rings)
Here he is.

17:40.982 --> 17:42.599
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.

17:42.650 --> 17:43.967
Come on in, Lee.

17:46.554 --> 17:48.739
So how are you?

17:48.806 --> 17:50.874
You look sleep-deprived.

17:50.925 --> 17:52.726
What can I tell you?
I guess not being

17:52.794 --> 17:54.677
allowed to do my job
doesn't agree with me.

17:54.729 --> 17:57.631
Listen, I'm well-aware

17:57.698 --> 17:59.499
that pending the outcome
of your trial review

17:59.584 --> 18:02.602
that the department has ordered
you to refrain from any work

18:02.687 --> 18:05.472
that might put you in contact
with the general public, but...

18:05.540 --> 18:07.574
Nothing like a vote of
confidence from your peers.

18:07.658 --> 18:10.326
But Allison--

18:10.378 --> 18:11.995
or rather
Allison's daughter--

18:12.062 --> 18:14.748
thinks she might know
where that missing girl is...

18:14.832 --> 18:18.218
or more accurately, who might be
behind her disappearance.

18:18.302 --> 18:20.637
She has an uncle

18:20.688 --> 18:23.773
Ariel is convinced
abducted her.

18:23.825 --> 18:25.709
DEVALOS:
He's a contractor by trade.

18:25.760 --> 18:28.595
Made lots of money
by taking abandoned

18:28.679 --> 18:30.664
and rundown buildings
and fixing them up.

18:30.748 --> 18:33.300
He owns properties
under lots of names

18:33.367 --> 18:34.484
all over Phoenix.

18:34.535 --> 18:35.719
Our best guess is

18:35.787 --> 18:37.787
that he's keeping this girl
in one of them.

18:37.839 --> 18:40.841
Why you telling me all this?

18:40.908 --> 18:43.009
I'm on administrative furlough.

18:43.094 --> 18:44.811
I've asked the department
to give me permission

18:44.896 --> 18:46.179
to get you to follow him.

18:46.264 --> 18:50.367
Not to make any actual contact,
just keep tabs on him.

18:50.434 --> 18:51.868
See if he leads us to her.

18:53.310 --> 18:56.429
Why? I mean, why me?

18:56.513 --> 18:59.348
There's a lot
of other detectives.

18:59.416 --> 19:01.834
Lee, your trial starts
next week.

19:01.919 --> 19:04.504
As the man who's gonna go out
and plead your case,

19:04.588 --> 19:06.506
I'd like to be able
to tell the board,

19:06.573 --> 19:07.807
"Hey, this detective's
still out there.

19:07.875 --> 19:09.792
"He's doing
important work.

19:09.843 --> 19:11.394
Solving
difficult crimes."

19:13.830 --> 19:15.865
And actually,
it was Allison's idea.

19:20.671 --> 19:22.838
Thank you for that
in there.

19:22.890 --> 19:24.757
Hey, I want to
tell you something.

19:24.841 --> 19:27.376
I had a dream about you.

19:27.427 --> 19:30.279
It was about everything that
happened the other night.

19:30.347 --> 19:31.580
Really?

19:31.632 --> 19:34.650
It was a really weird dream.

19:34.718 --> 19:35.751
How weird?

19:35.802 --> 19:38.638
Your brother Paul was in it.

19:44.711 --> 19:46.295
Okay.

19:46.346 --> 19:48.114
You were behaving...

19:48.198 --> 19:51.867
well, it was exactly like
the man

19:51.935 --> 19:55.087
who brought charges against you
was describing.

19:55.172 --> 19:57.306
Okay, well,
now I'm a little confused.

19:57.374 --> 19:59.608
You tell Devalos
to twist my boss's arm,

19:59.660 --> 20:01.010
put me on this case.

20:01.061 --> 20:04.030
Then you tell me you had a dream
where I assault a citizen

20:04.097 --> 20:05.464
in front of his wife and kid.

20:05.532 --> 20:07.182
Yeah, with your
dead brother watching,

20:07.234 --> 20:08.234
which makes it

20:08.302 --> 20:09.802
a pretty easy
dream to dismiss.

20:09.870 --> 20:11.170
Plus the fact

20:11.238 --> 20:14.657
that I've never seen you act
like that in real life.

20:17.527 --> 20:20.012
Come on. Lee, this is the part

20:20.097 --> 20:22.898
you're supposed to say to me,
"No, I never plowed my knee

20:22.950 --> 20:26.635
"into that man's nose with his
little boy standing there

20:26.687 --> 20:28.387
just pleading for me to stop."

20:28.472 --> 20:31.774
I know how this sounds.

20:31.841 --> 20:33.826
I don't honestly know
what happened that night.

20:33.910 --> 20:35.261
I don't really remember.

20:35.345 --> 20:37.613
I was working on
about 45 minutes sleep,

20:37.681 --> 20:38.914
and I still am.

20:38.982 --> 20:42.051
And when I think about it,
I don't really care.

20:43.637 --> 20:45.237
Are you familiar
with the expression,

20:45.322 --> 20:47.023
"The end justifies the means"?

20:47.090 --> 20:49.742
I needed that guy to stop
beating on his wife and kid.

20:49.826 --> 20:52.578
I sat in my car for a week
and I watched him threaten

20:52.663 --> 20:55.998
and bully and brutalize them.

20:56.066 --> 20:58.634
And when you thought about it
as much as I have,

20:58.702 --> 21:01.337
you realize that whether I laid
a glove on him or not,

21:01.405 --> 21:02.838
that's really kinda beside
the point.

21:02.906 --> 21:06.058
What matters is there's no way
in hell that he could ever raise

21:06.143 --> 21:10.579
so much as a pinky to that lady
or that little boy ever again,

21:10.631 --> 21:12.682
not without blowing his case.

21:12.733 --> 21:15.167
Not without admitting
to the world

21:15.235 --> 21:16.969
that he needs to be locked away.

21:17.054 --> 21:18.254
(elevator bell dings)

21:19.839 --> 21:22.575
Hey, what about you?

21:22.642 --> 21:24.944
I'm worried about you.

21:25.011 --> 21:26.612
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

21:26.679 --> 21:28.464
I just need a little sleep.

21:32.052 --> 21:33.369
Thank you for this.

21:33.453 --> 21:35.521
I won't let you down.

22:11.958 --> 22:14.159
(sighs)

22:21.501 --> 22:22.835
Hello, Allison's voice mail.

22:22.902 --> 22:24.703
This is Lee Scanlon,
roving detective.

22:24.771 --> 22:26.322
Well, either our boy
definitely has

22:26.406 --> 22:27.890
an unexpected female houseguest

22:27.974 --> 22:29.408
or else he has a weird
propensity

22:29.459 --> 22:31.560
to load up on feminine
drugstore products.

22:31.628 --> 22:33.545
I'll call later.

22:39.352 --> 22:42.288
Come on, you son of a bitch,
make me a hero.

22:42.355 --> 22:44.056
Take me home.

22:44.124 --> 22:45.741
Show me
where you're keeping her.

23:11.213 --> 23:12.781
You're stopping at the dentist?

23:14.216 --> 23:15.950
It's almost 4:30.

23:16.018 --> 23:18.586
Don't you know your houseguest
needs her toothpaste?

23:20.689 --> 23:22.590
YOUNG PAUL:
<i>You're not crying, are you?</i>

23:31.650 --> 23:33.835
Wasn't so bad.

23:36.705 --> 23:39.957
PAUL:
Hey, Mr. Good.
How you feeling?

23:40.009 --> 23:42.560
Nice and refreshed
after your little nap?

23:46.682 --> 23:48.666
Oh, no.

23:48.717 --> 23:50.602
What's the matter,
you lose something?

23:56.876 --> 23:58.176
Damn!

24:00.479 --> 24:03.498
(beeping)

24:04.733 --> 24:06.067
WOMAN:
Phoenix Police Department.

24:06.135 --> 24:07.218
Dispatch, this is Scanlon.

24:07.286 --> 24:08.853
I need some help out there.

24:08.904 --> 24:12.240
Tell me if anyone's got eyes
on a gray Ford Focus.

24:12.324 --> 24:17.312
License
8-7-Bravo-Bravo-Golf-Hotel.

24:17.396 --> 24:20.648
(phone beeps)

24:21.356 --> 24:23.340
Anybody hear me?
Is anybody out there.

24:23.408 --> 24:25.309
MAN:
Detective, I think
I see the vehicle,

24:25.393 --> 24:27.010
making its way west
down Market.

24:27.095 --> 24:28.162
Great. Fantastic.

24:28.229 --> 24:29.980
Do you want me
to pull him over?

24:30.064 --> 24:31.982
No, no. We can't let him know
he's being followed.

24:32.066 --> 24:33.684
I need him to lead me
to this girl.

24:33.768 --> 24:35.068
Just keep eyes on him

24:35.120 --> 24:37.537
till I can get over there
and catch up with him, okay?

24:37.589 --> 24:38.722
Sorry, Detective, I didn't copy.

24:38.790 --> 24:40.274
You want me to pull him over?

24:40.341 --> 24:43.810
No! Do not stop him! Damn it!

24:44.894 --> 24:46.845
PAUL:
What's the matter, bro?
Forget to charge your phone?

24:46.855 --> 24:48.686
Detective, I'm not hearing you.
Used to happen to me all the time.

24:49.376 --> 24:50.493
He's getting ready
to enter the freeway.

24:50.667 --> 24:51.617
I'm pulling him over.

24:51.685 --> 24:54.170
No! Do not pull him over!

24:54.254 --> 24:55.888
Do not pull him over!

24:55.956 --> 24:57.506
Sir, I need you to step out
of the vehicle.

24:57.591 --> 24:59.909
(tires squealing)
No! Let him go!

24:59.976 --> 25:02.828
That's right, put your hands
on the vehicle, please.
Let that man go!

25:02.896 --> 25:06.282
Detective, if you can hear me,
suspect has been apprehended.

25:06.366 --> 25:10.202
We'll be waiting
for you here.

25:10.270 --> 25:12.388
What's the matter,
Mr. Good?

25:12.455 --> 25:14.857
Having a bad day?

25:14.925 --> 25:16.976
Well, don't you worry.

25:17.043 --> 25:20.179
I'm here for you,
little brother.

25:20.247 --> 25:23.115
Just like I always been.

25:26.552 --> 25:28.119
I mean, how could
Detective Scanlon do that?

25:28.732 --> 25:30.633
Doesn't he realize
that he ruined everything?

25:30.684 --> 25:31.734
I don't know, sweetie.

25:31.785 --> 25:33.402
I don't have a good answer.

25:33.470 --> 25:34.887
If that man knows
the police are following him,

25:34.972 --> 25:36.822
he's never going to go to where
he's keeping his niece.

25:36.890 --> 25:38.324
I mean, he'll leave her
there to rot.

25:38.392 --> 25:40.259
I realize that.

25:40.327 --> 25:43.429
I'm sure that Detective Scanlon
realizes that, too.

25:45.365 --> 25:46.565
So what now?

25:49.353 --> 25:51.821
I don't know.
Sleep, I guess.

25:56.076 --> 25:58.694
You okay?

25:58.762 --> 26:00.596
Yeah.

26:00.647 --> 26:03.065
Go back to sleep.

26:15.011 --> 26:16.462
(car alarm chirps)

26:50.046 --> 26:52.615
(sighs)

26:54.101 --> 26:56.151
PAUL:
Come on, Mr. Good.

26:57.938 --> 27:01.223
It's going to make you
feel so much better.

27:01.274 --> 27:04.243
Come on, smoke it.

27:16.172 --> 27:21.010
Oh, man, what the hell
is the matter with you?

27:21.078 --> 27:22.945
Are you sure
we're even brothers?

27:24.047 --> 27:25.681
REBECCA'S UNCLE:
I spent the day today

27:25.749 --> 27:29.001
leading police detectives
through all of my properties

27:29.069 --> 27:33.155
here in Phoenix, assuring them
that I have absolutely no idea

27:33.223 --> 27:35.925
where she might be.

27:35.976 --> 27:42.128
So now in order to get the
investigation back on track,
(knocking)

27:42.437 --> 27:45.806
I am funding a $100,000 reward

27:45.857 --> 27:47.307
for any kind of information...

27:47.375 --> 27:48.942
Bad time?

27:48.994 --> 27:50.127
...that might lead

27:50.195 --> 27:51.745
to her safe return...
Is there any other kind?

27:51.796 --> 27:53.530
Come on in.

27:53.615 --> 27:56.784
We just want our Rebecca...
Lynn's at work.
Baby's at day care.

27:56.851 --> 27:58.752
So if anyone out there
has any information,

27:58.803 --> 28:01.572
please come forward.
It's one of my many admirers.

28:01.656 --> 28:05.425
Call the hot line.
You can call anon...

28:05.477 --> 28:07.945
I had another dream about you.

28:08.029 --> 28:09.596
Was it a happy dream?

28:09.647 --> 28:12.066
Tell me it was a happy dream.

28:12.133 --> 28:16.170
Well... (chuckles)
I liked the ending.

28:16.237 --> 28:17.888
You were staring temptation
in the eye

28:17.972 --> 28:20.674
and you told it to go home.

28:20.742 --> 28:24.294
You put it back in the trunk
of your car.

28:24.362 --> 28:27.231
Back under the
wheel well.

28:27.298 --> 28:30.401
Wow.

28:30.468 --> 28:31.985
I know this dream.

28:32.053 --> 28:34.121
Was your brother
in your version?

28:34.189 --> 28:35.189
Excuse me?

28:35.256 --> 28:37.191
Your dead brother Paul.

28:37.258 --> 28:39.359
In my dream, he was
egging you on.

28:39.411 --> 28:40.728
He was pushing you

28:40.795 --> 28:43.096
to fall off the wagon
with all his might.

28:43.148 --> 28:47.851
No. My brother was not present
in my version of the dream,

28:47.936 --> 28:50.287
but then again,
I don't really need any help

28:50.371 --> 28:51.722
falling off wagons.

28:51.806 --> 28:55.225
I'm a BYOG,

28:55.310 --> 28:57.911
bring your own gravity
kind of a guy.

28:57.979 --> 29:01.965
Be that as it may--
you know, he's haunting you.

29:02.033 --> 29:04.535
If anyone deserves
to be haunted...

29:04.602 --> 29:06.854
You've done nothing
to deserve this.

29:06.921 --> 29:08.705
He's a bad guy, Lee.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.624
Bad in life, bad in death.

29:10.675 --> 29:12.626
Which is why I came here
to tell you,

29:12.694 --> 29:14.728
he is working you hard.

29:14.796 --> 29:17.598
So if you feel like...
like you're gonna fall,

29:17.649 --> 29:21.502
if you feel like you're going
to hurt yourself, call me.

29:21.569 --> 29:24.121
You know, I'll keep you steady.

29:24.189 --> 29:25.622
I'll help you.

29:25.690 --> 29:27.241
'Cause this isn't a fair fight.

29:29.625 --> 29:31.743
I don't know,
maybe it kind of is.

29:31.764 --> 29:33.231
Why would you say that?

29:33.299 --> 29:34.983
(chuckles)

29:35.067 --> 29:38.186
Well, I always just kind
of assumed you knew.

29:38.254 --> 29:39.604
Knew what?

29:39.672 --> 29:41.656
You remember that night
you dreamed

29:41.741 --> 29:43.308
that lady was going to kill
my brother?

29:43.376 --> 29:45.243
You called me to warn me.

29:45.311 --> 29:47.295
I told you that
it was too late--

29:47.363 --> 29:48.547
it already happened?

29:51.701 --> 29:53.168
I lied.

29:53.252 --> 29:56.371
It hadn't happened yet,

29:56.455 --> 30:00.659
but it sure sounded like
a good idea to me.

30:00.726 --> 30:03.094
Oh, my God.

30:03.162 --> 30:04.829
My God.

30:04.930 --> 30:07.098
You let him die.

30:07.166 --> 30:09.384
You-you let her kill him.

30:09.452 --> 30:11.520
Like I said,
the end justifies the means.

30:14.390 --> 30:16.858
You still going to be there
to help me?

30:19.278 --> 30:22.130
You still going
to keep me steady?

30:24.984 --> 30:26.751
I don't know.

30:34.026 --> 30:36.928
Give my best to Lynn
and the baby.

30:40.466 --> 30:41.633
I'm sorry, sir.

30:41.700 --> 30:43.768
I don't know if
I can go through with it.

30:43.836 --> 30:45.903
I mean, I know that there
are plenty of people

30:45.955 --> 30:47.305
willing to testify
on his behalf.

30:47.356 --> 30:50.008
I think it will
all be fine without me.

30:50.076 --> 30:51.810
I'm sorry, sir.

30:52.845 --> 30:54.846
Thank you.

30:54.897 --> 30:57.332
(water running)

30:57.400 --> 30:59.601
(water stops)

31:00.598 --> 31:02.850
Devalos?

31:02.934 --> 31:04.418
How'd he take it?

31:04.502 --> 31:06.036
He sounded, uh,

31:06.103 --> 31:09.656
disappointed, puzzled.

31:09.741 --> 31:12.593
Well, it is, you know, puzzling.

31:12.660 --> 31:14.844
Excuse me?

31:14.896 --> 31:18.031
Tell me again why
you're mad at the guy.

31:18.099 --> 31:20.250
Because I called him.

31:20.318 --> 31:23.020
I told him, "Your brother
is going to die tonight."

31:23.087 --> 31:24.338
He did nothing.

31:24.422 --> 31:25.756
He just let it happen.

31:25.823 --> 31:27.341
So?

31:27.408 --> 31:31.094
So a man died unnecessarily.

31:31.162 --> 31:34.047
A man who rapes
and tortures women.

31:34.115 --> 31:35.415
Young girls, actually.

31:35.500 --> 31:36.600
Who knows what else?

31:36.668 --> 31:38.685
I think that's beside
the point.

31:38.753 --> 31:40.938
Sorry, I disagree.
That is the point.

31:40.989 --> 31:43.690
Hey, I'm sorry.
I dreamt it for a reason.

31:43.758 --> 31:45.842
I dreamt it so I could warn him.

31:45.910 --> 31:47.244
Says you.

31:47.311 --> 31:50.497
I mean, it looks like
it was his destiny

31:50.582 --> 31:52.566
to perish that night, Allison.

31:52.634 --> 31:54.484
It sure looks like
it was his fate.

31:54.536 --> 31:56.770
Clearly it wasn't, or I wouldn't
have had that dream.

31:56.838 --> 31:59.222
I wouldn't have been able
to warn him.

31:59.274 --> 32:00.657
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

32:00.725 --> 32:02.943
So if for some reason we'd
stayed up late that night,

32:03.027 --> 32:05.862
if we hadn't gone to bed, one of
the kids was sick or something,

32:05.914 --> 32:07.314
you didn't have the dream,

32:07.382 --> 32:09.366
so you didn't call Scanlon,
and his brother still died,

32:09.434 --> 32:10.701
then that would have
been okay?

32:10.768 --> 32:13.387
But I-I did get to bed.

32:13.454 --> 32:15.722
I did have the dream,
I did make the call.

32:15.807 --> 32:17.391
Wow, so you're really important.

32:17.458 --> 32:19.059
You're like an instrument
of God or something.

32:19.127 --> 32:21.278
Hey, I didn't say
anything like that.

32:21.346 --> 32:22.980
Well, you did, kind of.

32:24.002 --> 32:26.704
You're saying that fate can have
one plan, but that if you have

32:26.772 --> 32:28.673
a dream that contradicts it
and people ignore it...

32:28.740 --> 32:31.559
This is a ridiculous
conversation.

32:31.643 --> 32:33.544
Yeah, you're right,
but I didn't start it.

32:33.612 --> 32:36.948
A friend of yours has a brother
who deserves to die, dies,

32:36.999 --> 32:39.500
but because you had a dream
about it and told him so

32:39.585 --> 32:41.518
and he did nothing to stop
what seems like

32:41.570 --> 32:43.838
a pretty fortuitous thing,
he's a bad guy?

32:43.922 --> 32:45.139
That's not all of it.

32:45.207 --> 32:47.091
What? You mad because
he didn't take drugs?

32:47.159 --> 32:48.960
He beat that guy up
the other night.

32:49.027 --> 32:51.161
He denied him
his basic civil rights.

32:51.213 --> 32:52.780
That's the bad guy's version.

32:52.864 --> 32:54.549
Your friend doesn't remember
what happened

32:54.616 --> 32:55.716
and he needs your help.

32:55.784 --> 32:57.552
Fine. Except I dreamt he did it.

32:57.636 --> 32:59.420
I'm sorry, there were
dead people in your dream

32:59.504 --> 33:00.905
that night, Allison.

33:00.972 --> 33:02.723
Doesn't that at least
give you pause?

33:02.808 --> 33:04.842
Okay.

33:04.893 --> 33:07.178
I'm going to sleep.

33:11.116 --> 33:12.717
(door closes)

33:12.784 --> 33:14.051
REBECCA'S UNCLE:
<i>Rebecca, don't panic.</i>

33:15.087 --> 33:17.788
It's me.

33:18.742 --> 33:19.893
(muffled screams)
Sorry I was gone so long.

33:19.944 --> 33:21.344
I know I said
I'd be back last night,

33:21.428 --> 33:22.529
and believe me,
I wanted to be.

33:22.580 --> 33:23.963
I know you must be hungry.

33:24.014 --> 33:25.031
(sobbing)

33:25.082 --> 33:25.999
I know, I know. Shh, shh.

33:26.050 --> 33:28.334
Hey, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

33:28.385 --> 33:29.869
I know.

33:29.920 --> 33:32.255
I'll take your gag off
in a minute.

33:32.339 --> 33:34.324
I also...

33:34.408 --> 33:36.342
I got you some pills.

33:36.410 --> 33:37.994
To calm you down.

33:38.078 --> 33:41.164
Went to a dentist and convinced
him that I needed a root canal.

33:41.248 --> 33:43.299
He kept saying he didn't see
anything on the X-ray,

33:43.384 --> 33:45.585
but I didn't care,
I just let him do it.

33:45.653 --> 33:47.921
'Cause I want you
to relax.

33:57.931 --> 33:59.732
(sighs)

33:59.783 --> 34:01.601
Let's talk for a second.

34:01.669 --> 34:06.055
Tell you something that
you don't know about your uncle.

34:10.393 --> 34:13.279
11 years ago, I was...

34:13.347 --> 34:15.281
(sighs)

34:15.331 --> 34:18.801
...doing some contracting work
out of state,

34:18.886 --> 34:21.821
and there was this girl.

34:24.475 --> 34:26.309
Did you ever hear
of that expression

34:26.377 --> 34:27.310
"love at first sight"?

34:27.378 --> 34:29.762
(sobbing)

34:29.830 --> 34:31.447
I approached her,

34:31.514 --> 34:32.815
couple of times, in fact,

34:32.882 --> 34:37.469
but... she acted like
she wasn't interested.

34:37.538 --> 34:39.806
Okay.

34:39.873 --> 34:41.940
But I knew...

34:41.992 --> 34:43.275
I knew what I knew.

34:43.342 --> 34:46.262
And I knew what I felt.

34:49.063 --> 34:53.134
So I just showed up
at her house one night.

34:53.202 --> 34:56.821
Kind of... broke in.

34:57.840 --> 35:01.926
Anyway, I made my case.

35:01.994 --> 35:04.012
I told her that I thought
that this was serious.

35:04.079 --> 35:06.080
Now, she was getting ready
to go off to college,

35:06.165 --> 35:07.966
kind of like you,

35:08.033 --> 35:12.770
and I asked her
if she would put that off.

35:15.224 --> 35:16.791
Well, she got
kind of hysterical.

35:16.859 --> 35:21.112
One thing led to another,
and I sort of broke her neck.

35:21.163 --> 35:23.765
(sobbing loudly)

35:23.849 --> 35:26.301
You want one of those pills now?

35:30.472 --> 35:32.990
What I'm trying
to tell you is that

35:33.042 --> 35:34.659
two really interesting things
happened to me

35:34.727 --> 35:36.377
when I killed that girl.

35:36.462 --> 35:38.646
One, obviously,
I got away with it.

35:41.984 --> 35:44.903
The other thing--

35:44.954 --> 35:49.640
and I don't know
what to tell you about this--

35:49.692 --> 35:51.075
no guilt.

35:51.143 --> 35:52.260
(sobbing)

35:52.328 --> 35:54.462
Zilch.

36:05.352 --> 36:08.087
I don't want to kill you.

36:09.473 --> 36:11.374
But I want you to listen.

36:14.795 --> 36:19.215
There's got to be a way
for you to convince me

36:19.283 --> 36:22.685
that if I let you go,

36:22.770 --> 36:27.724
you will never tell anyone
about any of this.

36:29.193 --> 36:31.210
I'm certainly not gonna
say anything. (chuckles)

36:31.261 --> 36:33.229
(gasps)

36:43.035 --> 36:43.668
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

36:43.701 --> 36:44.418
Is this...?

36:44.447 --> 36:46.648
Absolutely, Mr. Helling.

36:46.732 --> 36:49.034
My name is District Attorney
Manuel Devalos,

36:49.101 --> 36:50.435
and I've been waiting for you.

36:50.486 --> 36:53.855
When they called, they
said this had something

36:53.923 --> 36:55.640
to do with my niece,
so I came right over.

36:55.708 --> 36:57.075
Is this my garbage?

36:57.126 --> 36:58.610
DEVALOS (chuckles):
I certainly hope so.

36:58.661 --> 37:00.996
This garbage is really
the reason

37:01.080 --> 37:04.082
I asked you to come down here
this morning.

37:04.133 --> 37:06.751
I was hoping to get you
to sign an affidavit

37:06.802 --> 37:09.471
specifying that all this
is indeed yours.

37:09.555 --> 37:11.489
Or was yours.

37:11.557 --> 37:13.558
Technically, it becomes
city property once you put it

37:13.626 --> 37:15.227
in the can.
What's this about?

37:15.294 --> 37:17.062
DNA.

37:17.129 --> 37:18.597
Uh, your DNA.

37:18.648 --> 37:21.516
I'm still not following.

37:21.601 --> 37:24.185
Look... Mr. Helling,

37:24.270 --> 37:26.688
if I can get you to admit
that all this is yours--

37:26.772 --> 37:28.607
and I think we both know
that it is--

37:28.674 --> 37:31.109
then I don't have to get a
court order to swab your cheek.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.461
Of course, you could volunteer
to let me swab your cheek,

37:33.529 --> 37:36.031
but I'm guessing you might be
reluctant to do so.

37:36.115 --> 37:40.035
Why in the world would you want
to swab my cheek?

37:40.119 --> 37:41.670
You don't still think that I had

37:41.754 --> 37:43.705
something to do with
Rebecca's disappearance?

37:43.789 --> 37:45.423
Actually, Mr. Helling,

37:45.491 --> 37:47.759
this isn't about
your niece's disappearance.

37:47.826 --> 37:50.095
We're looking for evidence
to connect you to a murder

37:50.162 --> 37:51.596
that took place
in Aurora, Texas,

37:51.664 --> 37:53.498
a little over a decade ago.

37:53.549 --> 37:57.018
You remember
Melissa Drake.

37:57.086 --> 37:58.303
You did construction work

37:58.354 --> 37:59.837
for her parents.

38:00.856 --> 38:03.508
How-how do you know...?

38:03.576 --> 38:05.677
A little birdie
called me.

38:05.728 --> 38:09.147
Actually, it was
a little birdie's mother.

38:09.198 --> 38:12.484
I take it you remember Melissa.

38:12.535 --> 38:13.685
I remember Melissa.

38:13.736 --> 38:17.855
She was killed,
by a burglar.

38:17.907 --> 38:21.859
Maybe she was
and maybe she wasn't.

38:21.911 --> 38:24.796
But whoever entered that house
ended up in a hell of a fight.

38:24.863 --> 38:26.564
And we know this
because the coroner found

38:26.632 --> 38:28.450
someone else's skin
beneath her fingernails

38:28.517 --> 38:30.218
when he autopsied her.

38:32.221 --> 38:34.756
Of course, back then, DNA was
still a pretty exotic thing.

38:34.840 --> 38:37.542
If you actually found some
on the victim,

38:37.593 --> 38:40.378
there were no databases
of DNA to compare it to.

38:40.429 --> 38:43.014
You see where I'm going?

38:44.850 --> 38:47.268
You know,
they're rather aggressive

38:47.353 --> 38:49.521
with the death penalty down
there in Texas, Mr. Helling.

38:49.572 --> 38:53.942
Over 125 sentences
carried out

38:54.026 --> 38:56.277
in the last
five years alone.

38:56.362 --> 38:59.447
Tell me where Rebecca is,

38:59.532 --> 39:01.866
and I might be persuaded
to talk to my counterpart

39:01.917 --> 39:03.234
in the Lone Star State,

39:03.285 --> 39:05.420
recommend some form of leniency.

39:10.593 --> 39:14.179
She was very malnourished and
obviously in a state of shock,

39:14.246 --> 39:15.880
but other than that...

39:15.931 --> 39:17.799
Helling signed
a full confession.

39:17.883 --> 39:19.884
My only regret is that
the district attorney

39:19.935 --> 39:23.054
in Aurora, Texas, is going
to get first crack at him.

39:25.057 --> 39:26.591
(sighs)
Thank you.

39:26.642 --> 39:28.476
I honestly don't know

39:28.561 --> 39:31.146
how any of this would have
happened without you.

39:31.230 --> 39:32.664
Actually, I didn't
do anything.

39:32.732 --> 39:34.816
I just answered the phone
and had a dream.

39:34.900 --> 39:37.736
Be that as it may,
you sure I can't persuade you

39:37.787 --> 39:39.270
to attend a school
closer to home?

39:39.321 --> 39:40.455
Uh...
(laughs)

39:40.539 --> 39:44.042
You hear that?
Do you hear that?

39:44.109 --> 39:46.110
Okay. I'm going to go pack now.

39:48.113 --> 39:49.581
Bye.

39:50.666 --> 39:52.250
Well, I better get
back to the office.

39:52.301 --> 39:54.118
I still have a mountain
of work to do

39:54.170 --> 39:56.805
before the trial board
hearing for Lee tomorrow.

39:56.889 --> 40:01.159
Listen, um, if you're still
interested in me testifying,

40:01.227 --> 40:03.094
Joe and I have been
talking about it,

40:03.145 --> 40:06.964
and it's like, it's like when
we spoke the other morning.

40:07.016 --> 40:09.967
I mean, none of this
sounds like the man I know.

40:11.970 --> 40:14.189
And I am happy to
testify to that.

40:14.273 --> 40:16.658
And we'd be thrilled
to have you do it.

40:18.694 --> 40:21.646
(doorbell rings)

40:21.697 --> 40:23.815
Evening, Mrs. Raymond.

40:23.866 --> 40:25.083
You remember me, right?

40:25.150 --> 40:26.584
I'm the fellow
who came between

40:26.652 --> 40:28.369
your husband's fist
and your face.

40:28.454 --> 40:30.988
My husband's due home
any second.

40:31.040 --> 40:32.424
If he sees you standing here...

40:32.491 --> 40:35.160
Your husband's busy trying
to boost hot flat-screens

40:35.227 --> 40:38.113
off the back of a
semi on Route 60.

40:38.180 --> 40:40.014
I do my homework,
Mrs. Raymond.

40:41.500 --> 40:42.500
Why do you look so scared?

40:42.551 --> 40:44.135
You got no reason to
be frightened of me.

40:44.186 --> 40:46.421
If anything, I should
inspire confidence in you.

40:46.489 --> 40:48.106
(scoffs softly)
Maybe it's because

40:48.173 --> 40:49.841
I've seen
what you're capable of.

40:49.892 --> 40:51.526
Wow.

40:51.610 --> 40:53.578
You know, I heard that
that was your version

40:53.646 --> 40:55.980
of what happened
that night.

40:56.031 --> 40:59.768
Me? I honestly have
no recollection.

40:59.835 --> 41:02.070
I find that hard to believe.

41:02.154 --> 41:03.304
No, it's true.

41:05.357 --> 41:08.910
Memory is a funny
thing, you know?

41:08.994 --> 41:10.795
One day, everyone's
calling you Lisa Raymond.

41:10.863 --> 41:14.749
You can barely remember when
your name was Claudia Wallert.

41:14.817 --> 41:17.135
Busted twice
for possession,

41:17.202 --> 41:18.353
second time with
intent to sell.

41:18.420 --> 41:20.021
What do you get for
that in Cleveland?

41:20.089 --> 41:22.023
Three years minimum
if convicted.

41:22.091 --> 41:25.042
But then, uh, you
weren't convicted.

41:25.094 --> 41:29.814
In fact, you never even
showed up for your court date.

41:29.882 --> 41:32.717
No wonder there's still a
warrant out for your arrest.

41:32.768 --> 41:34.519
That was a long time ago.

41:34.570 --> 41:36.053
I was a different person then.

41:36.105 --> 41:37.405
Oh, no. Hey, I get it.

41:37.490 --> 41:38.640
You were a desperate woman.

41:38.707 --> 41:42.160
I'm a desperate guy.

41:42.227 --> 41:46.164
Yeah... memory's a funny thing.

41:46.232 --> 41:48.483
Are you testifying at
my trial board hearing tomorrow?

41:50.953 --> 41:52.370
Okay.

41:52.421 --> 41:53.371
Don't answer.

41:53.422 --> 41:55.340
I heard you were.

41:55.407 --> 41:58.176
Uh, new subject.

41:58.243 --> 42:00.929
So what do you think
would happen if I were to call

42:01.013 --> 42:02.380
the Cleveland PD
and let them know

42:02.431 --> 42:03.798
where you've been making
your home lately?

42:03.883 --> 42:05.934
How long do you think
it would take them

42:06.018 --> 42:08.269
to send someone here
to collect you?

42:10.139 --> 42:13.274
How long do you think
your little boy would last

42:13.342 --> 42:15.844
if you left him here
with his father?

42:20.599 --> 42:22.033
(sighs)

42:22.100 --> 42:23.601
(groans)

42:40.085 --> 42:40.134
Allison.

42:42.087 --> 42:44.255
Wow, this is great.
This is fantastic.

42:44.306 --> 42:46.341
You showed. You made it.
You're here to help me.

42:46.425 --> 42:48.009
You're here to
keep me steady.

42:48.093 --> 42:49.427
No, actually, I'm not.

42:49.478 --> 42:51.629
I'm here to have Devalos
take me off the witness list.

42:51.680 --> 42:53.598
Hey, I know about
your little visit

42:53.649 --> 42:56.234
with the wife of the man
that you assaulted.

42:56.301 --> 42:59.020
I know that you threatened
to put her child in harm's way.

42:59.104 --> 43:00.772
What?

43:00.823 --> 43:01.773
(chuckles)

43:01.824 --> 43:03.107
I never said
anything of the kind.

43:03.158 --> 43:04.609
No, no, you're right.

43:04.660 --> 43:06.578
You know what, you didn't say
it, but your meaning was clear.

43:08.614 --> 43:11.416
I'm fighting for my
life here, Allison.

43:11.483 --> 43:13.001
For my job.

43:13.085 --> 43:14.752
For my future.

43:14.820 --> 43:16.621
I haven't slept in--
what year is it?

43:16.672 --> 43:17.989
I thought you
understood.

43:18.040 --> 43:19.540
Hell, you're the one who
told me I'm being haunted,

43:19.625 --> 43:20.708
it's not a fair fight.

43:20.793 --> 43:22.710
I'm just trying
to even up the odds here.

43:22.795 --> 43:24.796
Well, I think you're doing
a great job of it.

43:24.847 --> 43:26.848
And you know what,
at the end of this thing,

43:26.932 --> 43:28.516
I think you'll get
your job back.

43:28.601 --> 43:30.051
And at the end of this thing,

43:30.135 --> 43:32.520
I think you'll get back
everything you started with,

43:32.605 --> 43:34.055
except for my friendship.

43:34.139 --> 43:36.774
And you want to know why?

43:36.842 --> 43:40.528
'Cause I can't even
recognize you now.
