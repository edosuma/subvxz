00:02.069 --> 00:03.534
Let's go!

00:05.038 --> 00:06.371
-I think it's dope.

<i> The sparks are</i>

00:16.649 --> 00:18.483
<i> Our first ever pop-up shop.</i>

00:18.518 --> 00:19.517
Yeah!

00:21.088 --> 00:22.920
And then look, watch.

00:22.956 --> 00:23.654
ERIN:
<i> Oh...</i>

00:23.690 --> 00:25.523
my God.

00:25.558 --> 00:27.325
It's very ballsy.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.526
I cannot go home yet.

00:28.561 --> 00:30.428
ALEX:
<i> If you are going to cry,</i>

00:30.464 --> 00:31.729
go outside.

00:31.764 --> 00:32.697
Just sit your (bleep) ass down

00:32.732 --> 00:33.698
and calm the (bleep) down.

00:33.733 --> 00:36.201
-Oh, hell no!
-(bleep)

00:36.236 --> 00:37.469

-Nina Dobrev.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.245
Emily Ratajkowski

00:47.280 --> 00:48.713
This was one of
my favorite pieces

00:48.748 --> 00:50.715
I've seen in many seasons.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.583
HEIDI:
And you did it here first.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.219
It's kind of sad.

00:54.254 --> 00:57.088
NINA: Who is this
bland person?

00:57.124 --> 00:58.423
Fashion isn't fair.

00:58.458 --> 00:59.824
Does that mean you gave up?

MAH-JING: <i> I can't believe this.</i>
<i> (laughs)</i>

01:14.774 --> 01:16.541
I cannot believe I'm here!

01:21.081 --> 01:22.880
NATHALIA:
<i> I'm absolutely a hustler.</i>

01:22.916 --> 01:26.518
I try every day to hustle harder
than the day before.

01:26.553 --> 01:29.454
BRIK: <i> I still don't even think</i>
<i> that it's fully hit me yet.</i>

01:29.489 --> 01:31.256
That I'm in New York.

01:31.291 --> 01:33.124
-(car horn beeping)
<i> -When my dad dropped me off</i>

01:33.160 --> 01:34.592
<i> at the airport,</i>

01:34.627 --> 01:36.761
his eyes starting tearing up,

01:36.796 --> 01:39.797
and he said, "Remember to say,
'yes ma'am,' and 'yes sir,'

01:39.832 --> 01:41.566
and... to win, (bleep) it!"

01:43.036 --> 01:44.669
DEXTER: <i> </i>
<i> Fashion's actually not</i>

01:44.704 --> 01:46.137
<i> what I first started out doing.</i>

01:46.173 --> 01:47.805
I actually studied herpetology
at Berkeley.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.376
<i> I thought, "I don't know</i>
<i> that I can fully commit</i>

01:51.411 --> 01:53.545
<i> to being bit everyday for</i>
<i> the rest of my life."</i>

01:53.580 --> 01:55.246
Which is funny that I moved into
fashion, because it's kind of

01:55.282 --> 01:56.914
a similar thing,
it's just, like,

01:56.950 --> 01:58.316
not actual blood, but people
are kind of cutthroat.

01:58.351 --> 02:00.251
IAN:
<i> The point of me being here,</i>

02:00.287 --> 02:02.587
<i> as far as I'm concerned,</i>
<i> is to show off my work.</i>

02:02.622 --> 02:04.422
<i> I'm gonna do what I want to do.</i>
<i> My mother has said</i>

02:04.458 --> 02:06.324
that she hasn't been able
to tell me what to do

02:06.359 --> 02:07.392
since I was nine years old.

02:09.329 --> 02:10.961
This is so nice!

02:10.997 --> 02:12.830
<i> I feel really special</i>
<i> walking into this room,</i>

02:12.865 --> 02:14.199
<i> (laughing): because I didn't</i>
<i> want to touch nothing,</i>

02:14.234 --> 02:15.666
<i> it looked so good.</i>

02:15.702 --> 02:17.802
-Hey, how you doing?
-Hi! Good, how are you?

02:17.837 --> 02:18.836
-I'm Tasha.
-I'm Ian, nice to meet you.

02:18.871 --> 02:20.405
Nice to meet you.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.939
-We're the first ones, right?
-Yes.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.674
<i> In my hometown,</i>
<i> Shreveport, Louisiana,</i>

02:23.710 --> 02:25.310
<i> the girls with all</i>

02:25.345 --> 02:28.346
the overdone makeup,
and skintight dresses,

02:28.381 --> 02:30.415
and that is not me. (laughs)

02:30.450 --> 02:32.783
<i> I design for the girls that</i>
<i> don't like to wear heels.</i>

02:32.819 --> 02:34.685
<i> The tomboys.</i>

02:34.721 --> 02:37.255
<i> The girls that like to</i>
<i> stay relaxed but look chic.</i>

02:37.290 --> 02:39.357
<i> A lot of people</i>
<i> have told me that,</i>

02:39.392 --> 02:41.192
"You don't seem like the type
to be designing."

02:41.228 --> 02:43.060
I never knew that
a designer had a look.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.996
-TASHA: Hey.
-Hey, guys!

02:45.031 --> 02:46.297
I was gonna wear
that same outfit.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.465
(laughter)

02:47.501 --> 02:49.434
So, what kind of stuff
do you do?

02:49.469 --> 02:50.668
I make clothes and art.

02:50.703 --> 02:52.203
(laughter)

02:52.239 --> 02:53.971
ERIN:
<i> My aesthetic is humorous.</i>

02:54.007 --> 02:55.406
Playful, but also, with, like,

02:55.442 --> 02:57.375
<i> a little bit of,</i>
<i> like, a seriousness to it.</i>

02:57.410 --> 02:59.577
<i> There's always like,</i>
<i> some twist.</i>

02:59.613 --> 03:01.613
-I just finished up school.
So, I just graduated. -Oh, cool.

03:01.648 --> 03:02.947
I grew up partially Mormon.

03:02.982 --> 03:05.350
<i> I didn't have a lot of exposure</i>
<i> to Internet.</i>

03:05.385 --> 03:07.285
<i> My ex-stepdad would lock</i>
<i> the computer away.</i>

03:07.320 --> 03:08.919
<i> But I'm smart.</i>

03:08.955 --> 03:10.622
I think I'm smart. (laughs)

03:10.657 --> 03:12.157
Hooray. (laughs)

03:12.192 --> 03:14.159
-I do like, all ready-to-wear.
-Oh, nice.

03:14.227 --> 03:15.693
My big panic is, like,
the avant-garde stuff.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.162
-Oh, really?
-Yeah. I'm like...

03:17.197 --> 03:18.663
We're the-we're
the polar opposites.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.898
Yeah, give me, like,
the shift dress challenge,

03:20.933 --> 03:22.733
and I'm gonna own that bitch.
(laughs)

03:22.769 --> 03:24.769
ROBERI:
<i> I've been designing</i>

03:24.804 --> 03:27.338
for almost ten years.

03:27.374 --> 03:30.475
<i> At the beginning, I wanted to</i>
<i> go to architecture school.</i>

03:30.510 --> 03:34.212
<i> But I wanted to</i>
<i> see results faster.</i>

03:34.247 --> 03:35.547
Hey, I'm Tasha.

03:35.582 --> 03:36.814
<i> I was a designer</i>

03:36.883 --> 03:38.550
in Venezuela,
back home in Caracas.

03:38.585 --> 03:40.785
<i> But political situation,</i>

03:40.820 --> 03:41.586
<i> it's kind of difficult</i>

03:41.621 --> 03:43.188
to succeed as

03:43.223 --> 03:44.355
<i> a fashion designer there.</i>

03:44.391 --> 03:45.956
-It must be so crazy.
-Yeah.

03:45.992 --> 03:48.526
There's, like, so much drama
going on over there.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.127
Well, welcome.
I'm happy you're here.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.563
-Cheers.
-Yes!

-And I don't want to blow it.
-I love your necklace.

04:16.623 --> 04:18.589
-Thank you!
-I've been saving it.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.757
You know what it is? Um,
I'm actually a handbag designer.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.660
-These are two, uh rounded
handles. -Different handles.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.729
-Handles. That's awesome -TASHA:
<i> And what brought you out here,</i>

04:24.764 --> 04:26.698
-when you was here? -I was
modeling, back in the days.

04:26.733 --> 04:28.600
-Yeah. -Yeah, you look like a
model. (laughs)

04:28.635 --> 04:30.901
-And you're, like, a model.
-(laughing): You're sweet.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.169
Modeling was just
a hustle for me

04:32.205 --> 04:33.771
when I was going
to design school.

04:33.806 --> 04:36.541
<i> And I think they liked me</i>
<i> because...</i>

04:36.576 --> 04:39.611
<i> I look like a little boy.</i>

04:39.679 --> 04:41.679
-What kind of stuff do you do?
-I'm known for leather work.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.649
Oh.
Does it come from, like, animals

04:44.684 --> 04:47.017
-that are overpopulating?
That kind of stuff? -(laughs)

04:47.053 --> 04:48.620
I absolutely want
to change the world.

04:48.655 --> 04:49.954
I mean, who doesn't want
to change the world?

04:49.989 --> 04:52.690
<i> The problem</i>
<i> in the fashion industry</i>

04:52.726 --> 04:55.727
<i> is that a lot of things</i>
<i> are being mass produced</i>

04:55.762 --> 04:57.094
<i> in a negative way.</i>

04:57.130 --> 04:59.797
<i> Not disposing of dyes properly.</i>

04:59.832 --> 05:01.999
<i> Abusing people, child labor.</i>

05:02.034 --> 05:03.501
I believe that fashion doesn't
have to hurt.

05:03.536 --> 05:05.836
Hi guy... oh, (bleep)!
Nathalia?

05:05.872 --> 05:07.805

05:07.840 --> 05:08.939
What's going on, girl?

05:08.975 --> 05:10.541
NATHALIA:
<i> I'm freaking out, because</i>

05:10.577 --> 05:13.043
I know Corey 'cause I went to
school with him.

05:13.079 --> 05:14.812
We did shows together,
we competed together.

05:14.847 --> 05:16.614
And I beat him.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.383
CORNELIUS: <i> Me and Nathalia do</i>
<i> have a little rivalry.</i>

05:18.418 --> 05:21.352
<i> So, it's gonna be...</i>
<i> really interesting.</i>

05:21.388 --> 05:23.321
Good, that's good, that's good!
(laughs)

05:23.356 --> 05:24.989
-Oh, that's amazing.
-Very nice.

05:25.024 --> 05:27.458
-Yeah. -I have a... actually,
I have a dragon on mine.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.360
-I have a bee on my shoulder.
-Oh, that's cute.

05:29.396 --> 05:30.861
It's so small.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.330

Your laugh is so infectious.

05:41.574 --> 05:42.740
I tried warning a bitch, but...

05:42.776 --> 05:45.176
(laughter)

05:45.211 --> 05:47.011
See what happens
when you come in last?

05:47.046 --> 05:48.379
I know, right? I'm sorry.

05:48.415 --> 05:49.947
There's no more
champagne glasses,

05:49.982 --> 05:51.616
and I had to use a mug.

05:51.651 --> 05:53.551
Shut up.

05:53.586 --> 05:55.186

-Did you guys really think

06:08.735 --> 06:10.568
-you were gonna have this party
without us? -(laughs)

06:10.603 --> 06:12.637

-TIM GUN: No way.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.806

Who is that

06:17.410 --> 06:18.876
It's Jenni.

We've still got it.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.527
-The magic.
-We do.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.529
We have a lot of surprises for
you this season.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.831
-Uh-oh.
-Uh-oh.

06:39.866 --> 06:42.299
And the first of which
is right now.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.535
-This is it.
-Your first challenge

06:44.571 --> 06:47.037
is starting immediately.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.807
ALEX:
<i> Oh, my God.</i>

06:49.843 --> 06:52.243
-Wow. -BRIK: <i> I've had two</i>
<i> glasses of champagne,</i>

06:52.278 --> 06:55.145
and I'm like, thank God
I put that second glass down.

06:55.181 --> 06:57.081
We want you to take the spirit,

06:57.116 --> 06:59.884
the aura and the vibe of this

06:59.919 --> 07:04.789
fabulous launch party,
and incorporate those elements

07:04.824 --> 07:06.156
-into your first look.
-ERIN: <i> I'm pretty excited.</i>

07:06.192 --> 07:08.559
<i> Like, to make</i>
<i> a cocktail dress is fun.</i>

07:08.595 --> 07:11.629
Like, yes!
Like, I can do this.

07:11.664 --> 07:13.030
We actually want you
to take a little bit more

07:13.065 --> 07:14.365
than just the spirit.

07:18.738 --> 07:20.170
Whatever we decorated
this beautiful party with...

07:24.010 --> 07:25.743
...are your materials.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.712
Oh, (bleep).

07:27.747 --> 07:30.681
<i> I've never worked with</i>
<i> unconventional materials.</i>

07:30.717 --> 07:33.250
KIMBER: <i> How the hell</i>
<i> am I sew through candy?</i>

07:33.286 --> 07:34.685
How am I take a piece of bread

07:34.721 --> 07:37.121
<i> and make a dress?</i>

07:37.156 --> 07:38.389
HEIDI:
So, you grab whatever you can.

07:38.425 --> 07:39.990
If it's not nailed down,
it's yours.

07:40.026 --> 07:42.326
-Now?
-Not yet.

07:42.361 --> 07:44.495
Immediately, I start looking
around the room.

07:44.531 --> 07:47.164
<i> Checking out all the different</i>
<i> materials.</i>

07:47.199 --> 07:49.467
I'm actually really excited. I
can see hella (bleep) right now

07:49.502 --> 07:51.903
<i> -that I'd like to work with.</i>
-SARAH: <i> I was really waiting</i>

07:51.938 --> 07:54.271
for that one to be, like,
<i> the second of third challenge.</i>

07:54.307 --> 07:57.909

It is an unconventional
materials challenge.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.316
But remember, this is your first
opportunity

08:05.351 --> 08:07.819
to make an impression
upon the judges.

08:07.854 --> 08:10.521
So, you need to be true
to who you are as a designer.

08:10.557 --> 08:13.825
HEIDI:
You have exactly five minutes.

08:13.860 --> 08:14.859
Are you ready?

08:14.894 --> 08:15.860
ALL:
Yes!

08:15.895 --> 08:16.694

-Okay! I mean...

<i> My strategy is just to</i>

08:39.919 --> 08:41.852
run like hell,

08:41.888 --> 08:43.488

08:43.523 --> 08:44.489

08:44.524 --> 08:46.156

08:46.192 --> 08:47.959
My bad!

08:47.994 --> 08:51.696
I'm glad you're laughing!

08:51.731 --> 08:53.564
I really want the Polaroids.

08:56.736 --> 08:59.303
ERIN: <i> I just go straight</i>

08:59.338 --> 09:00.805
And just went crazy with yellow.

09:00.840 --> 09:04.876
HEIDI: Guys, you have
three more minutes!

09:07.480 --> 09:10.548
ROBERI:

09:10.583 --> 09:12.583

09:20.226 --> 09:22.026

-'Cause who doesn't love
glitter? -30 seconds.

-You guys rocked it!<i> -I just ran</i>

a bunch of stuff off walls in
front of Heidi Klum. (laughs)

09:43.750 --> 09:45.315

09:45.351 --> 09:47.217
TIM:
All right, designers.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.819
I am sending you
to the work room

09:48.855 --> 09:50.287
to get settled in,

09:50.322 --> 09:52.122
and I will join you very soon.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.191
I'll see you on the runway.

-Head off to the work room!

09:57.063 --> 09:59.764
TASHA: <i> Oh, man, I probably</i>

09:59.799 --> 10:02.266
hopefully, this will work.

10:02.301 --> 10:04.969
HEIDI: My God,
they really bashed this place.

10:05.004 --> 10:06.103
I think we deserve a drink now.

10:06.138 --> 10:07.905
TIM:
Are there are any glasses?

10:07.941 --> 10:10.775
Mm. There are no glasses,
but there are two bottles.

10:10.810 --> 10:11.776
One for you,

10:11.811 --> 10:12.977
one for me!

10:13.012 --> 10:14.579

10:14.614 --> 10:15.613

10:15.648 --> 10:17.114

-Wow!

10:17.149 --> 10:18.049
Cheers, Heidi!

10:18.084 --> 10:19.584
-To season 15!
-15.

10:23.189 --> 10:24.922
Mmm.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.757
That's nice, and it cuts out
the middle man.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.292

-I like it.

This is official.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.690
SARAH:
<i> Another surreal moment.</i>

10:59.726 --> 11:01.258
It's something I have seen

11:01.293 --> 11:03.927
<i> on TV for so long, and now,</i>

11:03.963 --> 11:05.363
it's me standing there.

-It is!
-This is great, yeah! (laughs)

11:12.472 --> 11:15.473
IAN: <i> I'm totally dreading</i>

11:15.508 --> 11:17.608
Fashion designers don't
hot glue (bleep) together,

11:17.643 --> 11:18.776
like, they just don't.

11:18.811 --> 11:21.612
I definitely need a glue gun.

11:21.647 --> 11:23.547
I'm taking two,
what are you... hmm.

TASHA: <i> I don't know what it is.</i>
<i> I don't know if it's the room</i>

11:31.758 --> 11:34.024
that's intimidating me.
I don't know if it's

11:34.059 --> 11:35.860
<i> being around other designers,</i>
<i> that-- I don't know what it is.</i>

11:35.895 --> 11:37.762
<i> 'Cause it's almost like,</i>
<i> I got a</i>

11:37.797 --> 11:39.129
fashion fart.

11:39.164 --> 11:39.730
Like, my brain is like,

11:39.766 --> 11:41.732
<i> at a standstill.</i>

11:41.768 --> 11:44.668
-I think that looks really cool.
-Yellow's your color.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.671
ERIN: <i> There's color, texture,</i>
<i> and structure.</i>

11:47.707 --> 11:50.608
So, I try to just keep two
crazy, and then one chill.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.476

-Do you like it? Good.
-ALL: Yes!

Speaking of fabulous, we have
the JustFab accessories wall,

12:09.395 --> 12:11.495
for your use this entire season.

12:11.531 --> 12:12.730
We have the Brother sewing room,

12:12.765 --> 12:14.799
which is behind this wall.

12:14.834 --> 12:18.836
Now, this is a one-day
challenge.

12:18.871 --> 12:21.505

a model fitting

12:30.750 --> 12:32.983

-Okay. -And I will see you

-Yeah!

-Oh, the taffy?
-Yeah.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.166
BRIK:
<i> So, there's this theory that,</i>

12:49.201 --> 12:50.734
<i> from an evolutionary</i>
<i> standpoint,</i>

12:50.770 --> 12:52.536
<i> that humans are drawn toward</i>

12:52.572 --> 12:55.773
shiny objects, because of their
constant search for water.

12:55.808 --> 12:59.677
<i> So, I think, like anybody,</i>
<i> I'm attracted to glitter.</i>

12:59.712 --> 13:01.411

13:01.447 --> 13:02.513

<i> My ultimate way of expressing</i>
<i> who I am as a person.</i>

13:21.834 --> 13:23.901
<i> And as an artist,</i>

13:23.936 --> 13:25.769
expression is the priority.

13:27.239 --> 13:29.707
JENNI:
You were scared?

13:29.742 --> 13:30.741
'Cause I've never really done
anything unconventional before.

13:30.776 --> 13:32.342
JENNI:
Oh, really?

13:32.378 --> 13:34.444
Oh, God. That's how I made
most of my clothes

13:34.547 --> 13:35.913
through fashion school,
'cause I couldn't afford fabric.

DEXTER: <i> I'm starting my design</i>

13:58.004 --> 13:59.937
<i> that I think was used</i>
<i> for photography.</i>

13:59.972 --> 14:01.939
<i> And then, I grabbed pillows</i>

a little bit more
editorial fashion.

I'm gonna use some of them on

16:25.184 --> 16:26.917
I'm so used
to being the pit bull.

16:26.952 --> 16:29.086
Oh, not to my employees
at all, but like, to-to--

16:29.121 --> 16:32.890
I mean, manufacturing's
a difficult industry.

16:32.925 --> 16:34.324
I do own a company.

16:34.359 --> 16:36.526
I've got ten people
that work for me.

16:36.562 --> 16:39.496
<i> And then, I teach once a week</i>
<i> at a college.</i>

16:39.531 --> 16:41.031
Should I do it on the side,
you think?

16:41.067 --> 16:43.100
ALEX: <i> If you ask for help,</i>
<i> I'm gonna do it.</i>

16:43.135 --> 16:45.703
<i> I think that's really good</i>
<i> karma and good sportsmanship.</i>

16:45.738 --> 16:48.205
I would...
Maybe see what Tim thinks?

16:48.240 --> 16:49.639
-Right.
-Do you know what I mean?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.374
Mm-hmm.

16:51.410 --> 16:53.610
You're like my, um,
Tim Gunn spirit animal,

16:53.645 --> 16:55.079
-right now, though.
-I try.

16:55.114 --> 16:56.747
-Make it work.
-Make it work.

16:56.782 --> 16:58.782
-Hi.
-Hello.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.984
-Hey, Tim! -Hello!
-Hey, Tim!

17:01.020 --> 17:04.121
So, it's our first critique
session-- how exciting!

17:04.156 --> 17:06.056
-Yay.
-Is everyone feeling ready?

17:06.092 --> 17:07.758
-Yeah!
-Great! I can't wait!

17:07.792 --> 17:10.694
BRIK: <i> I definitely don't want</i>
<i> to let Tim Gunn down.</i>

17:10.730 --> 17:12.896
I'd be ashamed
if I were that person.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.531
-Brik.
-Hello, hi, Tim.

17:14.566 --> 17:16.333
I'm eager to hear
everything about this.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.901
I found these
big bowls of glitter.

17:17.936 --> 17:21.204
And I wanted to make
a fun, fitted,

17:21.240 --> 17:24.574
and with a little flare
at the bottom pant.

17:24.609 --> 17:26.143
How is the glitter adhered?

17:26.178 --> 17:27.877
A various cornucopia of glues.

17:27.913 --> 17:29.412
-(laughs)
-Um...

17:29.448 --> 17:31.749
it just wants to go
to the floor or on me.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.516
So, you are going
to put more on.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.651
Yes, yes.

17:34.686 --> 17:36.086
Good, 'cause quite frankly,

17:36.122 --> 17:37.721
this is a real wow factor.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.824
-Carry on, Brik, okay.
-I will, I will.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.526
IAN: <i> Going into Tim's critique,</i>
<i> I'm not nervous at all.</i>

17:43.562 --> 17:45.595
Part of being an artist
is, like, getting crit.

17:45.631 --> 17:47.164
-Ian.
-Hi, Tim.

17:47.199 --> 17:48.198
You don't take it personally.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.967
While I respect your aesthetic,

17:50.002 --> 17:52.636
it seems very basic.

17:52.671 --> 17:53.637
I mean, honestly,

17:53.672 --> 17:55.005
this is, like, a lot of work.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.107
I would just consider

17:57.143 --> 17:58.809
doing something
that makes it look

17:58.844 --> 18:00.677
more fully integrated
into the garment,

18:00.712 --> 18:02.445
as opposed to something
that's-that's Velcroed on,

18:02.481 --> 18:04.614
that we could just take off.

18:04.650 --> 18:05.816
IAN:
Well, aesthetically,

18:05.851 --> 18:08.252
I do not do avant garde,
like, at all.

18:08.287 --> 18:10.287
So, it would be difficult
for me to be true to myself

18:10.322 --> 18:12.022
as a designer, just like,
putting stuff on there

18:12.057 --> 18:13.456
for the sake
of putting it on there.

18:13.492 --> 18:14.958
I want you to be who you are.
It's just,

18:14.994 --> 18:16.760
if you think about

18:16.796 --> 18:19.797
expanding this
into more volume--

18:19.832 --> 18:20.998
I hate volume.

18:23.135 --> 18:25.335
<i> I respect Tim 100%,</i>

18:25.370 --> 18:26.770
but I don't really think
I'm gonna change much.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.305
Like, at all.

18:28.340 --> 18:30.808
I don't like to do (bleep)
over the top.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.844
CORNELIUS: <i> Tim says Ian's</i>
<i> outfit is missing flair.</i>

18:33.879 --> 18:35.879
Ding, ding, ding--
change your outfit, Ian.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.016
So, I was thinking
I could create

18:39.051 --> 18:41.484
a skirt out of this,
but I just don't want the judges

18:41.520 --> 18:44.288
to be like,
"Oh, it's the Tin Man's wife."

18:44.323 --> 18:46.056
It's a very over-the-top look.

18:46.091 --> 18:48.192
You made a commitment to this.

18:48.227 --> 18:50.460
Own the bride of Tin Man.

18:50.495 --> 18:51.995
Okay!

18:52.031 --> 18:53.463
Just stunning.

18:53.498 --> 18:55.232
I love how you've
used these plates.

18:55.267 --> 18:56.700
In fact, I wouldn't
even know what they were,

18:56.735 --> 18:58.936
-which is fantastic.
-Awesome!

18:58.971 --> 18:59.870
Alex.

18:59.905 --> 19:01.972
-Hi, Tim.
-So, talk to me.

19:02.007 --> 19:04.007
I'm kind of liking
the angular shapes on them.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.375
It's extremely elegant.

19:05.410 --> 19:07.777
And I like how
you've used the polka dot.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.513
And I like the overall
silhouette.

19:10.549 --> 19:11.815
And I like
the surprise element.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.616
(exhales)

19:13.652 --> 19:14.885
Tasha.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.153
Hey, bossman.

19:16.188 --> 19:18.388
(laughs)

19:18.423 --> 19:20.190
So, I wanted to do
the drop-crotch,

19:20.226 --> 19:21.624
and, um, this top
I completely

19:21.660 --> 19:23.994
started on it,
like, 55,000 times.

19:24.029 --> 19:25.963
-How it's gonna fit on her...
-So, it's like a little bib?

19:25.998 --> 19:28.365
-Yeah, kind of like, yeah.
-Okay, yeah.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.600
-Back to the topic
of this bottom. -Okay.

19:30.635 --> 19:32.135
Is it only finished
in the front?

19:32.171 --> 19:33.871
InYe
ro t.
nthe f t .acheInk,

19:33.906 --> 19:35.605
wa  a s I keep it
black-and-white, 'cause I ran

19:35.640 --> 19:36.806
out of pieces of the cut...

19:36.842 --> 19:38.141
Oh, you have no more of that?

19:38.177 --> 19:41.444
-Nothing but this.
-Oh, dear.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.013
-All right, can I make
a suggestion? -Yes, please.

19:43.048 --> 19:44.248
And you're gonna
probably kill me.

19:44.283 --> 19:46.516
Recut the drop-crotch pants.

19:46.551 --> 19:48.218
-Okay.
-And just use this.

19:48.254 --> 19:51.121
TASHA: My concern was just
looking like a garbage bag.

19:51.156 --> 19:52.555
Bu nt .'s The color may be you,

19:52.624 --> 19:54.791
-but you don't have
any more of it. -Yeah.

19:54.826 --> 19:58.061
And then it looks like
you have a bib and an apron.

19:58.097 --> 20:00.130
NATHALIA: <i> I think Tasha</i>
<i> might be in trouble,</i>

20:00.165 --> 20:01.198
<i> because her critique is</i>

20:01.233 --> 20:02.399
not good at all.

20:02.434 --> 20:03.533
-Thank you, thank you.
-All right.

20:03.568 --> 20:06.336
-Are you feeling okay?
-Mm-hmm, yep.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.938
<i> I got to start all over again.</i>

20:07.973 --> 20:09.006
I'm panicking right now, like,

20:09.041 --> 20:10.573
I'm out of my mind
panicking right now.

20:10.609 --> 20:14.511
<i> I don't want to go home.</i>

20:14.546 --> 20:16.113
HEIDI:
<i> Coming up on</i> Project Runway...

20:17.283 --> 20:19.116
Tim is a little nauseous.

20:19.151 --> 20:20.683
I might put you in the bottom.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.886
If you have that walk,
you're gonna regret it.

20:22.922 --> 20:23.987
That's what this is--
Project Panic.

20:27.093 --> 20:29.326
TIM:
<i> Erin, wow.</i>

20:29.361 --> 20:31.128
-Yeah.
-How are you doing?

20:31.163 --> 20:32.930
I'm doing pretty good.
I got the color that I wanted.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.065
You certainly did.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.433
So, I opened up these wigs,

20:36.502 --> 20:39.469
and started playing
around with them.

20:39.505 --> 20:41.171
What I want to do is kind of,
like this off the shoulder...

20:41.206 --> 20:43.373
and it will kind of
look like a fur coat.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.110
So, what's happening
down below?

20:46.145 --> 20:48.211
I've been, like,
cutting the tracks

20:48.280 --> 20:50.380
to be, like, fringe,
and then I use the gumballs,

20:56.155 --> 20:57.487
My stomach is turning,
because it,

20:57.589 --> 20:58.922
it looks like you have
a ton of work to do.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.958
Yeah.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.626
How are <i> you</i> feeling?

21:02.928 --> 21:04.928
I feel good.

21:04.997 --> 21:05.996
You're not worried about time,
like I am?

21:06.065 --> 21:07.297
Hmm-mm, no.

21:07.332 --> 21:09.399
<i> Tim is a little nauseous</i>

21:09.501 --> 21:10.600
about me, so...

21:10.636 --> 21:11.802
<i> But, like, in a good way.</i>

21:11.837 --> 21:14.304
All right, thank you.

21:14.339 --> 21:15.572
Talk to me.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.675
I got to work with the lanterns.

21:17.743 --> 21:19.009
Then, I discovered they were

21:19.045 --> 21:22.479
capable of doing
very interesting shapes.

21:22.514 --> 21:25.115
-Yeah. -And starting playing
with the shapes.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.650
ALEX:
<i> Roberi's look</i>

21:26.719 --> 21:28.185
is just insane.

21:28.220 --> 21:29.419
<i> I love it.</i>

21:29.454 --> 21:30.954
I'm eager to see

21:30.990 --> 21:33.490
how this continues
to evolve.

21:33.525 --> 21:36.160
Holy crap, this is who
I'm competing against.

21:36.228 --> 21:38.261
The beads, you're
using them as a necklace.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.665
It's the unconventional
materials challenge, and then,

21:41.701 --> 21:42.833
you've used it
very conventionally.

21:42.935 --> 21:46.103
If I were a judge,
I might put you in the bottom.

21:46.238 --> 21:47.938
I have a very positive response

21:47.973 --> 21:50.373
-to how organic this is.
-Okay, okay.

21:50.409 --> 21:53.543
I just think
this shoulder treatment,

21:53.579 --> 21:55.979
I don't know
that you want to go for

21:56.015 --> 21:57.614
that Madonna, Galliano moment.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.549
Hey.

21:59.618 --> 22:01.284
I'm getting a little

22:01.320 --> 22:04.154
Andy Warhol,
Jackson Pollock, Banksy.

22:04.190 --> 22:06.857
I'm now a painter;
your average Picasso.

22:07.827 --> 22:08.792
It's now become

22:08.861 --> 22:11.628
a fine arts painting project.

22:11.663 --> 22:15.065
Have you just given
lip service

22:15.101 --> 22:16.666
to unconventional materials?

22:16.702 --> 22:18.202
I did manage
to grab some boas.

22:18.237 --> 22:21.105
-Okay.
-And I was gonna create a fur.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.405
But it was too costume,
like a fur shroud...

22:22.441 --> 22:24.407
I mean, at least you're
introducing another material.

22:24.443 --> 22:26.777
Right.

22:26.812 --> 22:27.644
I'll make it work.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.512
-You have to.
-I have to.

22:29.548 --> 22:30.547
-Hi.
-How are you, Dexter?

22:30.582 --> 22:32.116
Good, how are you?

22:32.151 --> 22:33.784
Eager to hear
what you're doing.

22:33.819 --> 22:35.518
Well, I'm working
on this top right now.

22:35.621 --> 22:37.654
And it was a pillow.

22:37.723 --> 22:39.689
So, you took the bedding out,

22:39.725 --> 22:41.558
and you're sticking
her head through it.

22:41.627 --> 22:43.426
Um, kind of, sort of, yeah.

22:43.462 --> 22:46.196
And this was an umbrella.

22:46.265 --> 22:47.998
And so, I took it apart.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.233
It's more of,
like, a circle skirt.

22:49.268 --> 22:50.934
Can I make an observation

22:50.970 --> 22:52.202
-about the umbrella skirt?
-Mm-hmm.

22:52.238 --> 22:54.437
I feel identically

22:54.506 --> 22:56.740
about this that I feel
that this pillow top.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.776
-Okay.
-You've basically

22:58.811 --> 23:03.480
taken an umbrella, removed the
engineering structure of it.

23:03.515 --> 23:05.649
-Mm-hmm.
-And put it on your model.

23:05.684 --> 23:07.951
I mean, it's basically
an umbrella that's a skirt.

23:08.020 --> 23:10.487
I-I don't feel that
there's enough here and

23:10.555 --> 23:13.323
I just think if you have that
walk, you're gonna regret it.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.559
DEXTER: <i> It's a messy, messy,</i>
<i> messy situation.</i>

23:16.595 --> 23:17.594
Like, I'm (bleep).

23:17.629 --> 23:19.997
All right, designers.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.799
I'm very excited about
the work that you're doing.

23:21.834 --> 23:24.367
And for most of you,
you have a lot of work to do.

23:24.469 --> 23:27.204
You have two hours remaining.

23:27.273 --> 23:30.140
Your models will be in
in one hour.

23:30.209 --> 23:33.143
It's your first impression
upon the judges.

23:33.179 --> 23:35.545
It's gonna be
a big day tomorrow.

23:35.647 --> 23:36.546
All right, good night.
Thank you.

23:36.648 --> 23:38.648
(designers clamoring)

23:38.717 --> 23:40.450
JENNI:
How did you do on your review?

23:40.519 --> 23:42.619
DEXTER: I'm like, in
mid-meltdown right now.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.454
I'm definitely
having a bit of a panic.

23:44.489 --> 23:46.623
You want to go sit in the room
for two minutes? Come on.

23:46.658 --> 23:48.826
That's what this is--
Project Panic.

23:48.861 --> 23:51.561
-He hates everything.
-What do you mean?

23:51.596 --> 23:52.830
He just didn't seem
enthusiastic about anything.

23:52.898 --> 23:53.897
So I-I don't know what to do.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.398
You need to focus on you.

23:55.467 --> 23:57.835
Who is Dexter, and you got
to get that on the form.

23:57.903 --> 23:59.303
I am doing something that's me,
but on the same note,

23:59.338 --> 24:01.538
like, "me" doesn't always work.

24:01.573 --> 24:04.441
I'm just not sitting
as easy as I expected to be.

24:04.476 --> 24:05.442
Nobody is.

24:05.544 --> 24:08.011
You need to look at it
objectively now.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.379
But you know what?

24:09.414 --> 24:11.181
It's gonna make you stronger
for the next round.

24:12.751 --> 24:14.218
I'm trying to just take each
moment for what it is.

24:14.286 --> 24:17.855
So, I'm gonna sew
until my hands bleed.

24:23.829 --> 24:25.595
(sputters, groans)

24:25.630 --> 24:26.830
DEXTER: It looks good.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.698
JENNI:
<i> I have these boas that...</i>

24:28.734 --> 24:29.699
they're kind of
obnoxiously gold,

24:29.735 --> 24:30.834
<i> but I'm gonna kind of create</i>

24:30.903 --> 24:32.502
<i> like, a faux fur jacket.</i>

24:32.537 --> 24:33.670
I'm always
making (bleep) happen.

24:33.705 --> 24:35.772
It has to or else I'm gone.

24:35.841 --> 24:37.040
It does look lux.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.342
Yeah, and I want
to keep the lux,

24:38.377 --> 24:40.744
so I was thinking,
like, a cloth short.

24:40.812 --> 24:41.945
Okay. I try to give my advice

24:42.014 --> 24:43.680
<i> to Nathalia, because</i>

24:43.715 --> 24:45.983
<i> I know her weaknesses</i>
<i> and her strengths.</i>

24:46.051 --> 24:48.485
I mean, it's a competition,
but she's my really good friend,

24:48.520 --> 24:51.355
and I'm not gonna let her
fall down the gutter.

24:51.390 --> 24:52.722
All right.

24:52.791 --> 24:54.291
No.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.527
-How you going, Tasha?
Working? -Oh, yeah.

24:57.562 --> 24:59.629
I have to start all over again,
with these pants.

24:59.664 --> 25:02.432
I don't have enough material
to fill the back like that.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.867
I don't even know I'm gonna be
able to finish this or not.

25:05.437 --> 25:07.437
BRIK: <i> I'm working on</i>
<i> what I'm gonna build</i>

25:07.472 --> 25:09.672
<i>for the top portion of my look.</i>

25:09.741 --> 25:12.342
I'm playing
with the cap bills

25:12.378 --> 25:15.212
<i> and exploring the shapes</i>
<i> that they make.</i>

25:15.281 --> 25:17.480
<i> It looks cool,</i>
<i> it looks weird.</i>

25:17.549 --> 25:19.416
It looks unconventional.

25:19.518 --> 25:22.019
-MAH-JING: What you thinking?
-TASHA: I like it.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.387
-I just want to see how it
would look on her, first. -Yeah.

25:23.488 --> 25:25.455
Before I be like...
(exhales)

25:25.524 --> 25:26.689
<i> I definitely want to win.</i>

25:26.725 --> 25:28.658
<i> I'm here for my daughter.</i>

25:28.727 --> 25:30.360
<i> And my wife.</i>

25:30.429 --> 25:32.930
<i> And I'm here for my love</i>
<i> for fashion.</i>

25:32.998 --> 25:34.864
I want to change,
not just my life,

25:34.900 --> 25:35.832
but the lives around me.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.434
All right.

25:37.502 --> 25:41.305
¶ ¶

25:41.373 --> 25:44.341
Look at that.
(laughs)

25:44.410 --> 25:46.910
RIK: Erin has nothing
up on the dress form.

25:47.012 --> 25:48.711
She's over in the corner,

25:48.747 --> 25:49.813
just messing around
with trinkets.

25:49.881 --> 25:51.648
Eating Pixy Stix.

25:51.683 --> 25:53.750
If Erin gets the wrong girl,
it could be a problem.

25:53.785 --> 25:55.419
<i> If I got a super pale redhead,</i>

25:55.487 --> 25:57.520
<i>and I had to put yellow on her,</i>
<i> I would die.</i>

26:01.493 --> 26:02.725
(indistinct chatter)

26:02.828 --> 26:04.962

Yeah. You got booty, girl.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.205
<i> And I'm using that</i>
<i> to make my design.</i>

26:15.240 --> 26:18.175
I'm feeling much better,
but not great.

26:19.611 --> 26:21.578
I know that I only have,
like a skirt made,

26:21.646 --> 26:23.646

26:31.957 --> 26:32.956
I've been on both sides
of the game.

26:33.058 --> 26:34.124
I know how to fit a model,

26:34.193 --> 26:35.725
and I know how to be
a fit model.

26:35.794 --> 26:37.594
-Fabulous, girl; I love that.
-(giggles)

26:37.662 --> 26:40.030
<i>It looks just how I wanted it</i>
<i> to look.</i>

26:40.065 --> 26:41.631
If I were a girl,
I would wear that.

26:41.666 --> 26:42.866
'Cause I kind of want to play

26:42.968 --> 26:43.766
with the hem a little bit more.

26:43.802 --> 26:45.168
<i> What I wanted</i>

<i> I feel like she does that</i>

26:51.643 --> 26:53.477
<i> I'm making an impression.</i>

26:53.545 --> 26:55.078
I think we're good.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.014
<i> The plates kind of just look</i>
<i> like toenail clippings</i>

26:57.049 --> 26:58.548

<i> just like layered</i>

26:58.583 --> 26:59.516

¶ ¶

27:01.086 --> 27:03.020
Gorgeous.

27:04.656 --> 27:06.289
NATHALIA: <i> I think Roberi might</i>
<i> be in trouble,</i>

27:06.325 --> 27:07.690
<i> because his model's</i>

27:07.759 --> 27:08.758
a little bit exposed.

27:08.827 --> 27:11.028
SARAH:
<i> His dress is so interesting.</i>

co'sd  olo  ait--

27:13.765 --> 27:16.533
I have a voluminous shape
on the top,

27:16.635 --> 27:19.369
<i> so I don't mind if it's</i>
<i> a little bit shorter</i>

27:19.405 --> 27:21.971
than usual.

27:24.609 --> 27:25.742
-Be good.
-Bye.

27:27.579 --> 27:28.578
Okay. In 40 minutes,

27:28.613 --> 27:30.547
I can re-sew this entire thing.

27:30.582 --> 27:33.716
<i> If I can just knock this top</i>
<i> out in one hour,</i>

27:33.785 --> 27:35.052
I will be fine.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.853
If this top
takes me three hours,

27:36.922 --> 27:38.388
I am triple-(bleep).

27:38.457 --> 27:40.524
<i> Erin, I can't wait</i>
<i> to see your look.</i>

27:40.625 --> 27:42.159
ERIN: <i> I think people</i>
<i> are worried about</i>

27:42.261 --> 27:44.461
<i> whether or not I'm gonna</i>
<i> be done on time.</i>

27:44.530 --> 27:45.895
But I think a lot,
and then I act.

27:47.966 --> 27:49.999
<i> Glitter's everywhere.</i>

27:50.069 --> 27:52.536
<i> I think it'll look really cool</i>
<i> if the glue sticks,</i>

27:52.604 --> 27:54.971
<i> but they definitely</i>
<i> do look like</i>

28:01.113 --> 28:02.879
I guess a unicorn
<i> could</i> wear them.

28:02.981 --> 28:04.481
I'd have to make
some alterations.

28:04.550 --> 28:06.816
DEXTER (mimicking Tim):
Designers!

28:06.885 --> 28:08.051
You don't have to go home,

28:08.087 --> 28:09.018
but you have to get the hell
out of here.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.287
(chuckles)

28:10.322 --> 28:11.688
Time to go.
We're done!

28:11.790 --> 28:13.123
(whooping)

28:21.166 --> 28:22.532
NATHALIA: <i> I'm done.</i>

28:22.568 --> 28:23.666
<i> I'm so happy I'm done.</i>

28:23.768 --> 28:26.035
I have to do some sewing, still.

28:26.071 --> 28:28.771
We are gonna be the four people
that make it to the top, so.

28:28.840 --> 28:29.973
-CORNELIUS: Absolutely.
-Hey.

28:30.075 --> 28:31.475
CORNELIUS:
I already know that.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.710
ROBERI:
<i> I really love my look,</i>

28:33.778 --> 28:35.212
but you never know--
it's the first time

28:35.314 --> 28:37.180
we're going to be facing
the judges,

28:37.249 --> 28:39.349
so it could be very good,
or very bad.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.651
TASHA:
<i> I'm really, really nervous.</i>

28:41.753 --> 28:42.885
<i> I'm really scared.</i>

28:42.921 --> 28:46.789
I cannot go home
on the first episode.

28:46.825 --> 28:49.692
<i> If they have nothing good,</i>
<i> it'd just tear me to pieces.</i>

28:49.761 --> 28:50.960
That ain't a dream of mine.

28:50.996 --> 28:52.462
<i> Good night, ladies.</i>

28:52.531 --> 28:54.030
HEIDI: <i> Coming up</i>
<i> on</i> Project Runway...

28:54.065 --> 28:55.365
I'm panicking.

28:55.434 --> 28:56.933
<i> Is she gonna send her</i>

28:56.968 --> 28:58.768
<i> naked down the runway?</i>

28:58.803 --> 29:02.739
-This to me is a standout look.
-So wrong.

29:02.807 --> 29:03.773
What kind of a designer are you?

29:05.109 --> 29:05.608
¶

29:05.710 --> 29:08.311
Oh!

29:09.915 --> 29:11.781
JENNI: Time to work, everybody.

29:11.884 --> 29:14.684
DEXTER: <i> I have tunnel vision--</i>
<i> It's like you're drunk</i>

29:14.719 --> 29:16.286
on the way home, and you're
trying to get your key

29:16.321 --> 29:17.820
in the door, and you're just
trying to get there.

29:17.856 --> 29:19.189
<i> That's what it feels like.</i>
<i> All I can see</i>

29:19.258 --> 29:20.390
is that runway at the end.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.259
I feel so much better--
last night,

29:22.327 --> 29:24.127
at the end of the night,
I just got so much more done.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.568
<i> I really love</i>
<i> Brik's glitter pants.</i>

29:30.636 --> 29:33.070
-Brik's glitter pants are dope.
-Brik is amazing.

29:33.139 --> 29:35.573
<i> The entire room has decided</i>
<i> as a group</i>

29:35.674 --> 29:36.907
that they really like
those pants.

29:36.942 --> 29:38.509
<i> I don't get it.</i>

29:38.578 --> 29:39.643
<i> I step back from my pants,</i>

29:39.745 --> 29:41.178
<i> and I just looked at them.</i>

29:41.214 --> 29:44.047
And I was like, why don't I just
cover the front

29:44.083 --> 29:45.349
<i> a different pattern way,</i>
<i> and cover the back</i>

29:45.384 --> 29:46.683
<i> a different pattern way?</i>

29:46.785 --> 29:48.486
<i> It'll give me the effect</i>
<i> that I need,</i>

29:48.521 --> 29:50.321
so I just started working
as hard as I can.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.826
Come on, Cornelius.

29:55.861 --> 29:57.161
<i> He's using flowers up top.</i>

29:57.196 --> 29:59.730
To me, it seems a little bit
predictable.

30:07.706 --> 30:10.407
<i> Roberi's working with these</i>
<i> Chinese lanterns,</i>

30:10.510 --> 30:11.975
and it's very sculptural,

30:12.011 --> 30:14.178
<i> and kind of winds</i>
<i> around the body.</i>

30:14.213 --> 30:16.614
<i> He's made a really</i>
<i> beautiful form.</i>

30:16.649 --> 30:18.915
Good morning, everyone.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.551
ALL: Good morning!

30:20.620 --> 30:22.085
All right,
it's our first runway.

30:22.188 --> 30:23.554
-How exciting is this?
-Yay!

30:23.589 --> 30:25.022
Yes.

30:25.090 --> 30:27.391
You will have two hours

30:27.426 --> 30:29.126
<i> to send your models to the</i>

30:29.162 --> 30:31.529
<i>Mary Kay Color Design Studio,</i>

30:31.631 --> 30:34.165
<i>and to the Sally Beauty Studio,</i>
<i> all right?</i>

30:34.200 --> 30:39.036
Use the JustFab accessories wall
very thoughtfully.

30:39.071 --> 30:40.837
-Okay? Thank you!
-Thank you.

30:40.939 --> 30:41.805
TASHA: Bye, Tim!

30:44.877 --> 30:47.645
ALEX: <i> Erin is still</i>
<i> gluing gumballs on,</i>

30:47.680 --> 30:49.480
and we don't have
that much time left.

30:52.585 --> 30:55.686
-IAN: Hi!
-TASHA: Hey, girl.

30:55.754 --> 30:58.121
IAN:
Sorry, I'm like, so short.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.690
I need, like, a step stool.

30:59.725 --> 31:00.957
I don't even know if we even

31:01.026 --> 31:02.125
have to lace it up.

31:02.195 --> 31:04.795
-You're into it?
-Yes.

31:04.863 --> 31:05.829
It looks finished.

31:05.931 --> 31:08.832
I would not change anything.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.033
<i>You know, it's not Tim's dress.</i>

31:10.102 --> 31:11.435
<i> It's mine.</i>

31:11.470 --> 31:12.503
Hey, Brik.

31:12.538 --> 31:13.604
She looks good, no?

31:13.706 --> 31:15.472
-Yeah.
-I'm gonna kill it.

31:15.508 --> 31:17.774
¶ ¶

31:17.843 --> 31:19.443
Again.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.645
-It looks beautiful.
-Thank you.

31:22.615 --> 31:24.047
IA
<i> </i>
truggling.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.716
<i> He has his model</i>

31:25.751 --> 31:27.284
<i> attaching more glitter</i>
<i> to the pants,</i>

31:27.320 --> 31:28.085
<i> which I think is smart,</i>

31:28.221 --> 31:30.321
<i> but weird.</i>

31:30.356 --> 31:31.488
There's glitter
literally everywhere.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.358
-BRIK: Glitter.
-MODEL: I know.

31:37.162 --> 31:38.995
(laughter)

31:42.167 --> 31:43.166
So, you design for a hip girl,
huh?

31:43.236 --> 31:44.668
Mm-hmm.

31:44.770 --> 31:47.003
We have a collection,
Runway Bold.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.305
TASHA:
Yeah. Those colors are nice.

31:48.374 --> 31:49.506
That has all of these
sort of colors.

31:49.542 --> 31:50.907
TASHA:
Oh, that's beautiful.

31:50.943 --> 31:54.111
This looks so amazing on.

31:54.313 --> 31:55.879
cIt
a 'sd algemiatl -mte

31:55.948 --> 31:57.281
I'll have you put it on.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.849
-But look at that.
-TASHA: Yeah. I like that.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.050
(camera shutter clicks)

32:00.152 --> 32:01.252
I want deep fuchsia, bright lip.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.786
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
-And then, I would like

32:02.855 --> 32:04.488
the inside of the eye
to look yellow, if you have it.

32:04.523 --> 32:05.589
And then fade out,

32:05.625 --> 32:06.990
into, like, the same fuchsia.

32:07.092 --> 32:08.125
Okay. We feel you.

32:08.227 --> 32:09.593
(camera shutter clicks)

32:13.198 --> 32:15.999
I would like her to have
cotton candy hair.

32:16.034 --> 32:17.268
Almost cloudlike.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.770
Maybe collapse down
through the center...

32:19.805 --> 32:21.705
-Yes. -...so she gets kind
of an expansion this way?

32:21.807 --> 32:23.140
ROBERI:
<i> Yeah.</i>

32:23.175 --> 32:24.941
The outfit's kind of crazy,
so I want to go

32:25.010 --> 32:25.809
very simple with the hair.

32:25.844 --> 32:27.444
-Like, a middle part...
-Okay.

32:27.480 --> 32:29.146
...and then, just like a nice
simple bun in the back.

32:29.214 --> 32:30.213
Cool.
Less is more.

32:30.316 --> 32:31.715
(camera shutter clicks)

32:31.817 --> 32:32.916
So, I was thinking,

32:33.018 --> 32:34.184
some sort of braid.

32:34.253 --> 32:35.852
Maybe along the...

32:35.888 --> 32:36.953
the line right here?

32:37.022 --> 32:37.854
-Okay.
-Like, sort of a crown?

32:37.890 --> 32:40.157
<i> We got it.</i>

32:42.528 --> 32:43.794
-Ooh!
-Oh, oh, oh!

32:44.697 --> 32:45.962
(soft laughter)

32:45.998 --> 32:47.364
IAN:
She looks cool.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.732
Great. You want to be
her friend, huh?

32:48.801 --> 32:49.733
She's a cool chick.

32:49.802 --> 32:51.268
BRIK: <i> My main focus</i>

32:51.304 --> 32:54.004
<i> is to just construct this top,</i>

32:54.072 --> 32:55.272
and finish the edges.

32:55.308 --> 32:57.040
<i>I don't know if it's gonna be</i>

32:57.142 --> 32:58.509
<i> enough time, but I'm gonna</i>

32:58.577 --> 33:00.344
<i> figure out a way</i>
<i> to finish my look.</i>

33:01.146 --> 33:03.547
(bleep)

33:05.050 --> 33:06.249
<i> The bottom look,</i>

33:06.352 --> 33:08.218
I am saying Mah-Jing.

33:08.321 --> 33:10.354
<i>It's a muslin-back dress with</i>

33:10.356 --> 33:10.387
to <i> run a pamp c</i>
peled jur, ost <i> e.n ut</i>

33:12.858 --> 33:14.558
I think his days are numbered.

33:15.928 --> 33:16.927
MAH-JING:
It's looking good, Tash.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.895
I like it.

33:18.931 --> 33:19.896
I like Tasha's look.

33:19.932 --> 33:22.065
<i>She has a Jamaican reggae vibe.</i>

33:22.134 --> 33:23.701
<i> Like, that girl's</i>
<i> gonna just like,</i>

33:23.769 --> 33:25.469
wind all up on the party.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.237
And then, I'm gonna help my baby
into these shoes, honey.

33:27.340 --> 33:28.405
Right.

33:30.743 --> 33:32.609
RIK: <i> Erin is working</i>
<i> down to the wire.</i>

33:32.645 --> 33:34.345
There's nothing
on the dress form.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.246
<i> She's still gluing</i>
<i> her gumballs.</i>

33:36.281 --> 33:38.315
Everything is laid
out on the table in pieces.

33:39.385 --> 33:43.119
Ooh... like, I don't know, guys.

33:44.289 --> 33:45.756
<i> We're obviously</i>
<i> all very nervous,</i>

33:45.825 --> 33:47.224
because it's our first runway,

33:47.292 --> 33:49.192
<i>and it's our first impression</i>
<i> on the judges.</i>

33:49.228 --> 33:50.594
ROBERI:
I'm sewing,

33:50.629 --> 33:52.062
I'm gluing,
I'm drinking,

33:52.097 --> 33:53.196
I'm panicking.

33:53.232 --> 33:54.631
My heart is pounding.

33:54.667 --> 33:55.699
<i> I'm hot, I'm cold.</i>

33:55.768 --> 33:57.267
<i> I'm nervous.</i>

33:57.336 --> 33:58.635
Everyone's, like, stressed out.

34:04.677 --> 34:06.209
Designers, in ten minutes,

34:06.245 --> 34:07.745
you and your models

34:07.813 --> 34:09.913
and I are going down
to the runway,

34:09.947 --> 34:11.181
all right?

34:11.216 --> 34:12.215
(designers groaning)

34:12.284 --> 34:14.217
Ten minutes, everyone.

34:14.286 --> 34:15.284
Brik, he's running around

34:15.353 --> 34:16.987
like a crazy man
without a head on.

34:17.022 --> 34:17.888
I was like... Yeah.

34:17.956 --> 34:18.955
CORNELIUS:
<i> Erin...</i>

34:19.024 --> 34:20.891
NATHALIA:
<i> Still has a lot of work to do.</i>

34:20.926 --> 34:21.992
Is she gonna send her model

34:22.060 --> 34:23.025
naked down the runway?

34:24.196 --> 34:25.061
JENNI:
Do you have a clip?

34:25.097 --> 34:26.864
-No. No, it's done.
-Like a clamp?

34:32.804 --> 34:34.137
And then, turn towards me.

34:34.172 --> 34:35.338
Designers and models,

34:35.373 --> 34:37.172
we are going down to the runway

34:37.275 --> 34:39.743
for our first runway show.

34:39.844 --> 34:41.478
-(whooping)
-TIM: How exciting.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.213
All right, let's go, go, go!

34:45.317 --> 34:46.683
It's the point of no return,
at this point.

34:47.686 --> 34:48.719
All right.

34:48.754 --> 34:49.753
These are looking good.

34:49.789 --> 34:51.221
CORNELIUS:
<i> Oh, I made it.</i>

34:51.322 --> 34:52.121
<i> As long as I made it,</i>

34:52.224 --> 34:55.592
<i> I'm so happy.</i>

34:55.694 --> 34:57.428
HEIDI:
<i> Coming up on</i> Project Runway...

34:57.496 --> 34:59.195
-Wow.
-One of my favorite pieces

34:59.298 --> 35:00.363
in many seasons.

35:00.466 --> 35:01.932
And you did it here, first.

35:01.967 --> 35:03.300
(laughs)

35:03.368 --> 35:04.868
You're like...
(panting rapidly)

35:04.937 --> 35:07.504
-I definitely didn't think
it was fashion. -Ooh.

35:07.606 --> 35:10.874
-You should've pushed
yourself a little more. -Ah.

-(soft laughter)

35:45.836 --> 35:48.036
Welcome to the runway.

35:48.071 --> 35:49.337
As you know, in fashion,
one day you're in,

35:49.373 --> 35:50.973
and the next day, you're out.

35:51.008 --> 35:53.842
There are 16 of you here,
and after tonight,

35:53.878 --> 35:55.811
there will be 15.

36:36.671 --> 36:37.836
All right, let's say hello
to our judges.

Also, we love

having Tim Gunn here,

37:04.799 --> 37:06.332

37:10.070 --> 37:12.471
We also have an anonymous

37:12.506 --> 37:14.272
No favorites here.
Okay?

37:14.308 --> 37:15.941
Let's start the show.

37:21.148 --> 37:23.148
MAH-JING: <i> </i>
<i> I think my model looks dope.</i>

37:23.183 --> 37:25.617
<i> Sexy, confident.</i>

37:25.653 --> 37:27.319
<i> She killing it.</i>

37:27.355 --> 37:29.521
<i> I'm like, "Yeah. I'm making</i>
<i> an impression."</i>

37:44.505 --> 37:45.937
JENNI:
<i> I took backpacks and boas,</i>

37:45.973 --> 37:50.041
<i> and created</i>
<i> a three-piece garment.</i>

37:51.512 --> 37:52.911
<i> And it was all hand-painted.</i>

37:52.946 --> 37:55.113
<i> That (bleep) looks</i>
<i> like Picasso.</i>

37:55.148 --> 37:56.214
<i> It's cute.</i>

38:08.696 --> 38:11.497
SARAH: <i> The light hits it.</i>
<i> I think it is beautiful.</i>

38:11.532 --> 38:13.565
<i> I think it communicates</i>
<i> what I wanted to communicate.</i>

38:13.601 --> 38:14.833
<i> And this is what the judges</i>
<i> sort of want to see.</i>

38:14.869 --> 38:16.535
<i> They want to see variety.</i>

38:16.570 --> 38:19.405
<i> They want to see different</i>
<i> points of views.</i>

38:19.440 --> 38:21.172
<i> I'm feeling very good</i>
<i> about my piece in relation</i>

38:21.208 --> 38:22.374
<i> to everybody else's piece.</i>

38:25.379 --> 38:27.312
NATHALIA: <i> </i>
<i> I created</i>

38:27.347 --> 38:28.747
<i> a textile out of place mats,</i>

38:28.783 --> 38:30.883
<i> and it just</i>
<i> looks amazing.</i>

38:34.555 --> 38:36.187
<i> It has a great</i>

38:36.223 --> 38:37.656
<i> runway effect,</i>
<i> and the judges</i>

38:37.691 --> 38:38.590
<i> seem to enjoy it,</i>

38:38.626 --> 38:41.059
<i> so, I'm happy.</i>

38:45.566 --> 38:47.533
DEXTER: <i> I feel like my garment</i>
<i> definitely represents me</i>

38:47.568 --> 38:49.535
<i> as a designer.</i>

38:49.570 --> 38:51.870
<i> I do take a lot of risks,</i>
<i> and I hope that</i>

38:51.906 --> 38:55.441
<i> they keep me here,</i>
<i> so that I can give them</i>

38:55.476 --> 38:56.809
<i> 15 othe riskiest garment</i>
<i> in</i> Project Runway <i> history.</i>

39:05.486 --> 39:06.485
RIK:
<i> I feel extremely</i>

39:06.520 --> 39:08.219
<i> excited, and I love</i>

39:08.255 --> 39:10.255
<i> the way that she walks.</i>

39:10.290 --> 39:11.323
<i> She is definitely</i>
<i> working the runway.</i>

39:24.872 --> 39:25.938
IAN:
<i> It's beautiful.</i>

39:25.973 --> 39:27.506
<i> It's got just enough sparkle.</i>

39:27.541 --> 39:28.841
<i> I mean, texturally,</i>

39:28.876 --> 39:30.241
<i> it's, like, very strong.</i>

39:32.379 --> 39:35.213
<i> I think the palette is amazing.</i>

39:35.248 --> 39:36.281
<i> Like, I could base</i>

39:36.316 --> 39:38.149
<i> a collection off of that dress.</i>

39:45.258 --> 39:47.158
TASHA: <i> I'm loving the way</i>
<i> she's walking out.</i>

39:47.193 --> 39:48.293
<i> The attitude she's giving.</i>

39:48.328 --> 39:49.960
<i> She's really working</i>
<i> this outfit.</i>

39:50.029 --> 39:51.162
<i> She's working</i>
<i> that little handbag</i>

39:51.197 --> 39:52.764
<i> that I made.</i>

39:53.066 --> 39:54.333
<i> She's really selling</i>
<i> the type of girl</i>

39:54.602 --> 39:55.434
I
thig <i> es dr.fo</i>

40:05.346 --> 40:06.445
ERIN: <i> </i>
<i> I'm feeling so proud.</i>

40:06.480 --> 40:07.579
<i> Yellow is definitely</i>

40:07.615 --> 40:08.747
<i> one of those colors</i>

40:08.783 --> 40:10.282
<i> that's a hit or a miss color,</i>

40:10.318 --> 40:11.517
<i> and I'm feeling like</i>
<i> I'm sending something bold</i>

40:11.552 --> 40:13.118
<i> down the runway.</i>

40:27.034 --> 40:29.368
LINDA: <i> Wow.</i>
<i> She looks beautiful.</i>

40:29.403 --> 40:30.969
<i> She looks edgy.</i>

40:31.004 --> 40:32.471
<i> She looks innocent.</i>

40:32.506 --> 40:33.972
<i> Just fabulous.</i>

40:50.157 --> 40:51.523
KIMBER:
<i> I'm speechless.</i>

40:51.559 --> 40:52.591
<i> She's gorgeous.</i>

40:52.626 --> 40:53.859
<i> She's killing it.</i>

40:55.629 --> 40:58.630
<i> This explains everything</i>
<i> about me</i>

40:58.666 --> 41:01.400
<i> from head to toe.</i>

41:12.780 --> 41:14.179
LAURENCE:
<i> So, yeah, it-it's scary.</i>

41:14.214 --> 41:15.614
<i> I didn't use much color,</i>

41:15.649 --> 41:16.648
<i> and the top that I used</i>

41:16.684 --> 41:18.016
<i> is close to muslin.</i>

41:18.051 --> 41:19.050
<i> So, at this point,</i>

41:19.086 --> 41:20.051
<i> I'm just praying that I make it</i>

41:20.087 --> 41:22.020
<i> through the next round.</i>

41:31.632 --> 41:32.865
BRIK:
<i> I'm happy with my look.</i>

41:32.900 --> 41:34.600
<i> It looks cool.</i>
<i> It looks crazy.</i>

41:34.635 --> 41:35.967
<i> It looks unconventional.</i>

41:37.671 --> 41:39.638
<i> This is either gonna</i>
<i> be on the bottom,</i>

41:39.673 --> 41:42.374
<i> or on the top,</i>
<i> because I went all out for it.</i>

41:48.248 --> 41:49.748
CORNELIUS:
<i> I'm hoping the judges</i>

41:49.784 --> 41:51.283
<i> see that I took</i>

41:51.318 --> 41:53.552
<i> the plates and cut them</i>
<i> at angles,</i>

41:53.587 --> 41:56.154
<i> so that it</i>
<i> kind of reads as petals</i>

41:57.825 --> 41:59.090
<i> incorporated in the top piece.</i>

41:59.126 --> 42:01.126
<i> Because I love it.</i>

42:11.004 --> 42:11.804
ROBERI:
<i> I really feel that</i>

42:11.839 --> 42:13.705
<i> my design represents</i>

42:13.741 --> 42:17.509
<i> me as a designer.</i>

42:17.545 --> 42:20.211
It
at i <i> an Is tote we. cd </i>

42:20.247 --> 42:22.147
<i> It's quite</i>
<i> an amazing experience.</i>

42:30.991 --> 42:32.458
ALEX:
<i> The model turns the corner,</i>

42:32.493 --> 42:34.660
<i> and I about wet my basement,</i>

42:34.728 --> 42:36.161
<i> beuse it lks stunng,</i>
and my mel

42:36.196 --> 42:38.497
<i> was just shining.</i>

42:38.532 --> 42:41.533
<i> And I am extremely happy</i>
<i> with what I put forward.</i>

42:48.943 --> 42:53.512
I have to say this was a very,
very exciting runway show.

42:53.547 --> 42:55.013
I mean, this was the best
beginning that I've had

42:55.048 --> 42:57.483
in the five years
that I've been on the show.

42:57.518 --> 42:58.584
I love that we chose

42:58.619 --> 43:00.185
this unconventional challenge

43:00.220 --> 43:02.688
to start them off
and really get

43:02.723 --> 43:03.555
their creative juices flowing.

43:03.591 --> 43:04.623
Okay, designers.

43:04.658 --> 43:06.592
We have just learned
which designer

43:06.627 --> 43:08.393
created which look.

43:08.428 --> 43:09.895
If I call your name,
please step forward.

43:09.930 --> 43:12.364
Roberi.

43:12.399 --> 43:14.833
Dexter.

43:14.869 --> 43:16.902
Tasha.

43:16.937 --> 43:18.370
Erin.

43:18.405 --> 43:19.771
Ian.

43:19.807 --> 43:22.007
Brik.

43:22.042 --> 43:25.343
If I have not called your name,
congratulations.

43:25.379 --> 43:27.546
Your scores have qualified you
to move on

43:27.581 --> 43:29.481
to the next round.
You can leave the runway.

43:34.855 --> 43:37.288
JENNI:
Oh, my gosh.

43:37.324 --> 43:38.390
X:   r A-ALE
htllHA y.LIA: We did it.

43:38.425 --> 43:40.125
-SARAH: Yeah.
-KIMBER: Oh.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.527
SARAH: Neither the top
nor the bottom.

43:41.562 --> 43:42.628
I have to say,
this is gonna be...

43:42.663 --> 43:43.862
SARAH:
It's gonna be crazy.

43:43.898 --> 43:45.631
...one tough season.

43:45.666 --> 43:46.899
The six of you have the highest

43:46.934 --> 43:48.934
and the lowest scores.

43:48.969 --> 43:49.968
One of you will be named

43:50.004 --> 43:51.637
the winner, and one of you

43:51.672 --> 43:52.771
will be out.

43:56.443 --> 43:58.243
All right, I would like
to start with you, Tasha.

43:58.279 --> 43:59.278
Tell us how this look

43:59.313 --> 44:00.912
represents you

44:00.947 --> 44:02.581
as a designer and about

44:02.616 --> 44:03.749
the materials that you used.

44:03.784 --> 44:05.150
TASHA: I'm a designer

44:05.185 --> 44:06.151
for sexy and street.

44:06.186 --> 44:07.252
Loud, colorful.

44:07.288 --> 44:08.720
The urban girl.

44:08.756 --> 44:10.255
And, um, for the bag I used

44:10.291 --> 44:12.090
the director's chair.

44:12.125 --> 44:13.392
Uh-huh.

44:13.427 --> 44:15.226
I used Mood's reusable bags.

44:15.262 --> 44:16.961
I used Twizzlers.

44:16.997 --> 44:19.464
Um, a pillow case and backpacks

44:19.500 --> 44:21.199
atth we had in the room,
as well.

44:21.234 --> 44:23.302
I have to say, I love this look.

44:23.337 --> 44:24.670
-I see a girl like this
-(softly): Thank you.

44:24.705 --> 44:26.405
walking down the street
right now,

44:26.440 --> 44:28.340
and I would say,
"Wow, she looks really cool."

44:28.375 --> 44:29.474
She just looks like

44:29.510 --> 44:30.809
an urban girl that you

44:30.844 --> 44:31.943
would see today.

44:31.978 --> 44:33.812
-Great job.
-Thank you.

44:33.847 --> 44:37.716
-The look was very effective.
-Thank you.

44:37.751 --> 44:39.651
NINA: Her clothes say,
"I've got attitude."

44:39.687 --> 44:42.454
The shape of the pants,
the proportion.

44:42.489 --> 44:43.955
This is you.

44:43.990 --> 44:45.557
Thank you so much.

44:45.592 --> 44:47.526
My favorite thing is
that you made a bag

44:47.561 --> 44:48.927
with Tim and Heidi's
names on it.

44:48.962 --> 44:49.961
(laughs)

44:50.030 --> 44:51.830
I think the silhouette
is really cool,

44:51.865 --> 44:53.231
and you pulled it off.

44:53.266 --> 44:54.366
For us regular women,

44:54.401 --> 44:56.100
that's a tough one to wear,

44:56.136 --> 44:57.669
but she looks gorgeous.

44:57.705 --> 44:58.804
Mission accomplished.
You did it.

44:58.839 --> 45:00.539
Blessings. Thank y'all, so much.

45:00.574 --> 45:02.774
I love that you played with
the textile. It's very cool.

45:02.810 --> 45:04.343
-She's too legit to quit. Yeah.
-Exactly.

45:05.813 --> 45:06.712
It was very effective.

45:06.747 --> 45:08.347
-Well done.
-Thank you.

45:08.382 --> 45:09.314
Are you a little nervous?

45:09.350 --> 45:11.416
I'm anxious. (laughs)

45:11.452 --> 45:13.385
-You're anxious
for our feedback? -Mm-hmm.

45:13.420 --> 45:15.220
-Well, so far, so good, right?
-Thank God.

45:15.255 --> 45:18.156
(chuckles)

45:18.191 --> 45:19.758
Brik.

45:19.793 --> 45:20.792
Tell us about the materials

45:20.828 --> 45:22.060
that you used.

45:22.095 --> 45:23.395
So, I ended up finding

45:23.430 --> 45:25.129
these big tubs of glitter.

45:25.165 --> 45:29.300
I started off and drafted
a pant, uh, with a flare leg.

45:29.336 --> 45:31.269
And, um, I... luckily,

45:31.304 --> 45:32.871
collected all of these hats.

45:32.906 --> 45:34.138
Ah! That's what that is.

45:34.174 --> 45:35.173
So, I wanted something

45:35.208 --> 45:36.908
that was structured,

45:36.943 --> 45:39.310
and to show what I can do
as a tailor.

45:39.346 --> 45:40.512
I have to tell you,

45:40.547 --> 45:42.347
she looks mismatched to me.

45:42.416 --> 45:45.049
-On top, she looks
very futuristic. -Yeah.

45:45.085 --> 45:48.353
And the bottom
kind of looks retro, disco.

45:48.389 --> 45:50.021
I do have to say, what you did

45:50.056 --> 45:51.857
with the brims is terrific.

45:51.892 --> 45:52.858
I wish you would've

45:52.893 --> 45:54.292
stuck to one theme.

45:54.327 --> 45:56.160
-Yeah. -Take that theme
and run with it.

45:56.196 --> 45:57.896
I mean, it's like
Lady Gaga on top,

45:57.931 --> 45:59.364
ABBA on the bottom.

45:59.400 --> 46:00.999
She's got many personalities.

46:01.034 --> 46:02.267
-ZAC: She's got a lot--
and Heidi... -(laughs)

46:02.302 --> 46:03.402
-And <i> Rebecca of Sunnybrook</i>
<i> Farm...</i> -In the hills.

46:03.437 --> 46:04.403
-SAVANNAH: ...at the top...
-ZAC: Totally.

46:04.438 --> 46:05.904
...meets <i> Star Wars</i>

46:05.939 --> 46:07.606
meets Studio 54.

46:07.641 --> 46:10.275
But what is clear, is that
you play with construction.

46:10.310 --> 46:13.111
I think the texture
you created on the pant

46:13.146 --> 46:16.114
is kind of pretty and magical
and effective.

46:16.149 --> 46:16.981
It just doesn't work together.

46:17.017 --> 46:18.950
-Yes. (chuckles)
-Hot mess.

46:18.985 --> 46:20.285
(laughs)

46:20.320 --> 46:22.020
Ooh.

46:22.055 --> 46:23.154
Here's the dilemma that I have.

46:23.189 --> 46:24.188
I don't know

46:24.224 --> 46:25.323
who you are as a designer.

46:25.358 --> 46:27.125
-Okay.
-I'm not really sure

46:27.160 --> 46:29.294
what kind of designer are you.

46:29.329 --> 46:30.695
I-I understand

46:30.731 --> 46:32.431
what you're saying
about the off-ness of it.

46:32.466 --> 46:35.066
But thank y'all.

46:35.101 --> 46:36.601
Did you just say, "Y'all"?

46:36.637 --> 46:38.169
I'm from the South, y'all.

46:38.204 --> 46:39.471
(Brik laughs)

46:39.506 --> 46:41.139
Erin. Tell us about your look,

46:41.174 --> 46:43.341
and who you are as a designer.

46:43.376 --> 46:44.776
So, I love fun,

46:44.812 --> 46:46.244
and just, energy, in my work.

46:46.279 --> 46:47.446
-And I... I...
-(sarcastic): No.

46:47.481 --> 46:48.379
(laughs)

46:48.415 --> 46:50.248
-(laughter)
-Um...

46:50.283 --> 46:51.817
and this is actually,

46:51.852 --> 46:54.453
um, the wig, with, like,
the netting in it.

46:54.488 --> 46:56.488
And these are gumballs.

46:56.523 --> 46:58.490
And then, this is more
of the tracks that I just, like,

46:58.525 --> 47:00.959
trimmed to, like,
look like fringe.

47:00.994 --> 47:02.193
Wow.

47:02.228 --> 47:03.328
This, to me,

47:03.363 --> 47:05.363
is a standout look.

47:05.398 --> 47:06.498
I love the color.

47:06.533 --> 47:07.966
It shows me who you are.

47:08.001 --> 47:10.401
It shows me that
you're about fun, but also,

47:10.437 --> 47:12.604
you have great ideas,

47:12.639 --> 47:15.139
and you make it slick
and perfect looking.

47:15.175 --> 47:16.107
Thank you.

47:16.142 --> 47:17.542
Just a complete explosion

47:17.578 --> 47:19.578
of color walking
down the runway.

47:19.613 --> 47:21.446
I love that halter top.

47:21.482 --> 47:22.914
I think it's so pretty.

47:22.950 --> 47:25.550
It's so universally flattering.

47:25.586 --> 47:27.218
I think it looks beautiful.

47:27.253 --> 47:28.419
Thank you.

47:28.455 --> 47:29.588
NINA:
You know,

47:29.623 --> 47:31.255
this could've gone so wrong.

47:31.291 --> 47:34.058
This could've been Big Bird
on the runway,

47:34.094 --> 47:36.160
but it didn't.

47:36.196 --> 47:39.698
It's what we call, in the
magazine world, very editorial.

47:39.733 --> 47:42.166
It's inspirational
for the stylist,

47:42.202 --> 47:44.669
for the photographer,
for the magazine.

47:44.705 --> 47:47.071
Beautiful play of proportion.

47:47.107 --> 47:49.808
It's very tastefully done,

47:49.843 --> 47:52.010
-but with a punch.
-Thank you.

47:52.045 --> 47:53.444
This was one of
my favorite pieces

47:53.480 --> 47:56.481
I've seen on the show
in many seasons.

47:56.517 --> 47:58.349
Thank you. (chuckles)

47:58.385 --> 47:59.484
You played with texture,

47:59.520 --> 48:01.820
excellent wearable proportions,

48:01.855 --> 48:04.556
but it's made out of
gumballs and wig hair.

48:04.591 --> 48:05.724
It's, like, magically Muppety.

48:05.759 --> 48:07.425
Great start to the season.

48:07.460 --> 48:08.827
Dexter.

48:08.862 --> 48:10.395
-Hi.
-HEIDI: Tell us about

48:10.430 --> 48:12.096
the materials that you used.

48:12.132 --> 48:13.899
I used this, um, rug I found,

48:13.934 --> 48:17.068
um, and then these
are different pillows

48:17.103 --> 48:18.937
that I broke apart
and sewed together

48:18.972 --> 48:20.438
into different patterns.

48:20.473 --> 48:21.706
I kind of wanted to have that

48:21.742 --> 48:24.242
Alaskan mountain tribe,
like, um,

48:24.277 --> 48:25.810
girl's coming-of-age party,

48:25.846 --> 48:27.412
but I wanted to, like,
keep it current

48:27.447 --> 48:29.648
with more of, like,
a-a circle skirt.

48:29.683 --> 48:31.382
And, um, I took
little pieces of it

48:31.418 --> 48:33.384
and put it on the shoes, because
I thought the pop of color

48:33.420 --> 48:34.986
would really, like,
help bring it all together.

48:35.022 --> 48:37.388
Um, sorry, I'm nervous! Aah!

48:37.558 --> 48:39.691
I llca
n hn te yvoow.ouusre

48:39.726 --> 48:40.892
I'm dying right now. (laughs)

48:40.928 --> 48:42.694
You're like....
(imitates panting)

48:42.729 --> 48:46.064
I definitely got Alaskan poodle.

48:46.099 --> 48:48.366
You know, it had
that Inuit tribe references,

48:48.401 --> 48:51.570
and I'm happy that you had
a story behind it.

48:51.605 --> 48:54.639
I like how you played
with the pattern.

48:54.675 --> 48:57.475
And it was effective
when it went down the runway.

48:57.510 --> 49:00.045
But I think you can go
even further.

49:00.080 --> 49:02.413
-Good job.
-Thank you.

49:02.449 --> 49:03.715
It was a runway piece.

49:03.750 --> 49:07.586
It had this incredible volume,

49:07.621 --> 49:10.354
wh
eaisich ppy  rgenhainhi f
uiasotte q. l

49:10.390 --> 49:12.123
You used the rug and made it

49:12.158 --> 49:14.492
have volume and movement.

49:14.527 --> 49:16.928
It looks tribal.

49:16.964 --> 49:18.730
-And very chic.
-Thank you.

49:18.765 --> 49:21.399
And then, I love your little
details. I love the fact that

49:21.434 --> 49:23.568
you put those bracelets
on her ankle.

49:23.604 --> 49:25.336
I like this very much.

49:25.371 --> 49:27.438
Thank you so much. (sighs)

49:27.474 --> 49:29.574
Using a big fluffy rug...

49:29.610 --> 49:31.743
is kind of scary.

49:31.778 --> 49:33.311
It scared me a little bit.

49:33.346 --> 49:34.746
And it worked.

49:34.781 --> 49:37.983
It really did.
I loved this look.

49:38.018 --> 49:39.484
-(sighs) -I really did.
When it came around the corner,

49:39.519 --> 49:41.586
I was, like, "Wow."

49:41.622 --> 49:44.255
One, because it's super gutsy

49:44.290 --> 49:45.590
to use this kind of material,

49:45.626 --> 49:47.458
because she could
look like a big blimp.

49:47.494 --> 49:48.860
But she doesn't.

49:48.895 --> 49:50.729
If you would see that
walking down

49:50.764 --> 49:54.198
the runway in Paris somewhere,
I would go like, "Yeah."

49:54.234 --> 49:56.334
And you did it here first.

49:56.369 --> 49:59.004
Thank you. I'm really, really
happy-- you have no idea.

49:59.039 --> 50:00.571
It definitely has
this point of view,

50:00.607 --> 50:02.040
which you pulled
together so well,

50:02.075 --> 50:04.242
from the earrings
right down to her feet.

50:04.244 --> 50:06.444
in  'sk I thevo iterclhayo
tsopu thmet rie f

50:06.479 --> 50:08.913
almate
to get the shoess
rthe color you wanted..

50:08.949 --> 50:10.248
I just think that you had

50:10.283 --> 50:12.684
so much ingenuity
and resourcefulness.

50:12.719 --> 50:14.085
You did it.

50:14.121 --> 50:16.454
(sighs)

50:16.489 --> 50:19.390
Ian. Tell us what materials
you used for your look.

50:19.425 --> 50:21.192
I built a shift piece,
basically.

50:21.227 --> 50:23.628
And used, um,

50:23.664 --> 50:25.429
everything that I did to kind of

50:25.465 --> 50:27.699
try to give something
that doesn't move movement.

50:27.734 --> 50:30.035
What I grabbed were, um,

50:30.070 --> 50:31.936
those big screens,
the printed photographs

50:31.972 --> 50:33.805
that were hanging up
on the wall.

50:33.840 --> 50:35.840
I grabbed a couple of pillows

50:35.876 --> 50:38.342
that had, like, tassel detail,
which I really like.

50:38.378 --> 50:39.678
It's a little, like,
<i> My Little Pony</i> scheme,

50:39.713 --> 50:41.179
which is, like,
kind of my thing.

50:41.214 --> 50:43.081
And I grabbed
all of the Polaroids.

50:43.116 --> 50:44.382
I actually, like,
really love it.

50:44.417 --> 50:45.550
I think she looks fantastic.

50:45.585 --> 50:48.619
(sighs)
I did not love this dress.

50:48.655 --> 50:50.388
You just said it yourself.

50:50.423 --> 50:52.290
It's a basic shift dress.

50:52.325 --> 50:55.493
There's no magic for me
in this dress.

50:55.528 --> 50:57.796
You didn't create something
with the Polaroids.

50:57.798 --> 50:59.263
thLi
k ey, ,li loo

50:59.299 --> 51:01.299
ke
Yoboom, boom, there's twong
Polaroids glued on.

51:01.334 --> 51:02.701
It's such a great challenge.

51:02.736 --> 51:04.402
The sky's the limit.

51:04.437 --> 51:06.304
You could go nuts with this,

51:06.339 --> 51:07.772
and really show us something
that sings and dances.

51:07.808 --> 51:09.473
And this, to me,

51:09.509 --> 51:11.409
doesn't really have any of that.

51:11.444 --> 51:13.511
I feel like you didn't
use this opportunity.

51:13.546 --> 51:17.315
I-It was a risk, going minimal.

51:17.350 --> 51:19.250
Just because, I mean, that is
sort of true to who I am.

51:19.285 --> 51:22.386
I do not really work
with a lot of volume

51:22.422 --> 51:24.956
because I don't like it,
not because I can't.

51:24.991 --> 51:26.591
It just really fell short,
for me.

51:26.626 --> 51:30.394
And it also doesn't
look that neat.

51:30.430 --> 51:32.597
You know, on the back, when...
Can she turn, the model?

51:32.632 --> 51:35.066
You know,
everything's symmetrical,

51:35.102 --> 51:36.634
bu
ht    steromn, d waith  owey s,

51:36.669 --> 51:38.603
you know, to kind of
shift to the side.

51:38.705 --> 51:41.239
Part of that has to do with
the fact that I can't press it.

51:41.274 --> 51:43.641
There's nothing glued.
Like, the textile panels

51:43.710 --> 51:45.343
that are in it,
actually took, like, a lot...

51:45.378 --> 51:47.511
like, a large amount of time.

51:47.547 --> 51:49.347
You know, whether it's
hand-sewed or glued,

51:49.382 --> 51:50.782
it doesn't really matter.

51:50.817 --> 51:53.351
This is a challenge
that is about effect.

51:53.386 --> 51:56.788
I mean, maybe you hand-cut
each one, but I can't tell.

51:56.823 --> 51:59.190
I do think there is something
modern and interesting

51:59.226 --> 52:01.325
within the <i> My Little Pony</i>
color scheme.

52:01.361 --> 52:03.728
That, I think,
I'm gonna give you credit for.

52:03.764 --> 52:07.665
I just wish I had
had the chance here to see more.

52:07.700 --> 52:09.734
On the plus side,

52:09.770 --> 52:11.335
I thought the colors
were really pretty together.

52:11.371 --> 52:14.438
And I liked them
when they came down the runway.

52:14.474 --> 52:18.442
I actually thought the texture
was very interesting.

52:18.478 --> 52:24.115
I thought those icy colors that
you chose were very beautiful.

52:24.151 --> 52:28.419
Unfortunately, it doesn't feel
like you were creative enough.

52:28.454 --> 52:31.256
I feel like you should've
pushed yourself a little more.

52:31.291 --> 52:33.691
Roberi. Tell us about your look.

52:33.726 --> 52:35.960
I wanted to work
with the lanterns,

52:35.996 --> 52:40.899
because I-I really felt that
the material were very light.

52:40.934 --> 52:42.667
So for me was very interesting

52:42.702 --> 52:47.438
to twist the shapes,
swirl forms, very organic.

52:47.473 --> 52:50.441
And the fantasy of creating
something cloudlike

52:50.476 --> 52:52.443
started taking shapes

52:52.478 --> 52:57.816
inspired by, just, movements
in the clouds and the sky.

52:57.851 --> 52:59.784
I have to say, when this
came around the corner,

52:59.820 --> 53:02.787
I kind of gasped.
But not in a good way.

53:02.823 --> 53:05.589
I don't know. I didn't like
the colors together.

53:05.625 --> 53:08.359
I thought it was too short
when she walked out.

53:08.394 --> 53:12.797
I didn't even really
respond to it as fashion.

53:12.833 --> 53:15.733
I have seen this dress.

53:18.805 --> 53:20.905
An sd
ewith many different versions.is

53:20.941 --> 53:22.874
There is no balance.

53:22.909 --> 53:24.843
It's all, like, up there.

53:24.878 --> 53:26.711
I know that you two
didn't like it so much,

53:26.746 --> 53:28.412
but I actually
really love this dress.

53:28.448 --> 53:30.681
We have seen pretty much
everything already,

53:30.717 --> 53:33.084
and everything
gets reinvented again

53:33.253 --> 53:34.919
d   neeranso uyomes
inthgomomnget slshi

53:34.955 --> 53:37.822
e.
This, though,
we have not seen before.

53:37.858 --> 53:41.025
And it is the way
you interlocked them

53:41.061 --> 53:43.561
that created this
beautiful sculpture.

53:43.596 --> 53:44.996
I actually love
the colors together.

53:45.031 --> 53:46.297
I love the silver, the white,

53:46.333 --> 53:48.166
the gold and the blue.

53:48.235 --> 53:50.034
I also don't mind
that it is short.

53:50.070 --> 53:51.970
Will you turn around? Can I see
the back one more time?

53:52.005 --> 53:53.471
Let's do a little...

53:53.506 --> 53:54.839
I think it is really pretty.

53:54.875 --> 53:56.807
I mean, it does have
some poetry to it.

53:56.843 --> 53:59.010
The way it just
weaves and curls,

53:59.045 --> 54:03.047
and it leaves me wanting to see
more of what you can do.

54:03.083 --> 54:04.983
I thought it was
incredibly sensitive.

54:05.018 --> 54:07.051
I think it's actually
beautifully done.

54:07.120 --> 54:10.454
Yes. We have seen
many pieces on this show,

54:10.490 --> 54:15.126
uh, made out of, you know,
a circular piece.

54:15.161 --> 54:16.794
-Yeah.
-But it's <i> how</i> you do something.

54:16.829 --> 54:19.597
I like the colors,
like Heidi does.

54:19.632 --> 54:22.000
And, uh, you know,
is it wearable?

54:22.035 --> 54:23.634
No. But that's not the point.

54:23.669 --> 54:26.604
-I think it's really fun.
-Thank you.

54:26.639 --> 54:28.706
Okay. We've heard
what you had to say.

54:28.741 --> 54:30.674
We're gonna have a little chat

54:30.710 --> 54:33.044
and then I'm gonna call you
back. Thank you.

54:38.318 --> 54:40.518
CORNELIUS:
So what did the judges say?

54:40.553 --> 54:41.519
NATHALIA:
Who's on the bottom?

54:41.554 --> 54:42.987
-No.
-Really?

54:43.023 --> 54:45.656
-Hold on!
-We're all very shocked by that.

54:45.691 --> 54:47.558
They just tore me apart.

54:47.593 --> 54:48.826
(Brik chuckles)

54:48.861 --> 54:50.094
Like,<i> Star Wars</i>

54:50.130 --> 54:52.931
with prairie hair,
and, uh, like, uh...

54:52.966 --> 54:54.765
Which, I love <i> Star Wars.</i>

54:54.801 --> 54:57.868
-She hated yours?
-Hated it. Heidi hated it.

54:57.904 --> 54:59.737
I think that's (bleep).

54:59.772 --> 55:01.639
(crying quietly)

55:05.645 --> 55:07.845
-Hello, judges.
-Hi, Tim! -Hi, Tim!

55:07.881 --> 55:09.180
What a wonderful
kickoff challenge.

55:09.215 --> 55:11.515
-I know.
-HEIDI: Yes. Hello, ladies.

55:11.551 --> 55:14.085
-We couldn't have a better
beginning. -HEIDI: All righty.

55:14.120 --> 55:15.953
Okay, we have Keke
wearing Tasha.

55:15.989 --> 55:18.990
HEIDI: They look better
on the runway than up close!

55:19.025 --> 55:20.591
-It's... very cool.
-You know, because

55:20.626 --> 55:22.593
they're just really
hard to sew, and...

55:22.628 --> 55:24.495
-So are these plastic... Tim,
are these plastic... -TIM: Yes.

55:24.530 --> 55:25.663
-They're-they're Mood bags
that she cut up. -Mood bags.

55:25.699 --> 55:27.165
-ZAC: Wow.
-TIM: Yeah.

55:27.200 --> 55:28.599
-And these are Twizzlers. Yes.
-TIM: Yes.

55:28.835 --> 55:30.367
Th

55:30.403 --> 55:31.803
-t

55:31.838 --> 55:33.470
-Including the girl
with the bag. -How great.

55:33.506 --> 55:35.439
How fun.

55:35.474 --> 55:37.608
-I need that bag. (laughs)
-TIM: Director's chairs.

55:37.643 --> 55:39.510
My Tim and Heidi bag.

55:39.545 --> 55:40.945
(laughs)

55:43.683 --> 55:46.184
-TIM: And we have Sherica
wearing Erin. -ZAC: Yeah. Wow.

55:46.219 --> 55:47.885
Unbelievable.

55:47.921 --> 55:50.487
-Fanned out. -NINA: This is
what I love. -Wow.

55:50.523 --> 55:52.924
-The mesh that she did
right here. -Yeah.

55:52.959 --> 55:54.759
-ZAC: The wig mesh.
-I mean, how do you even cut

55:54.794 --> 55:56.227
those gumballs in half?

55:56.262 --> 55:57.762
-I don't know.
-Without cracking them?

55:57.797 --> 55:59.463
She didn't just use it
as crazy down here, again.

55:59.498 --> 56:02.133
-Yeah. -You know, she made it,
like, so...

56:02.168 --> 56:02.734
It-'s balanced.
-...precise.

56:02.769 --> 56:03.868
It's balanced.

56:06.172 --> 56:09.240
And we have Stacy
wearing Dexter.

56:09.275 --> 56:11.943
HEIDI: This, too, I thought
was very cool.

56:11.978 --> 56:13.611
I think this guy has good taste.

56:13.646 --> 56:16.748
-Yes. -Down to the little
detail of the bracelet,

56:16.783 --> 56:18.750
and he did the shoe...

56:18.785 --> 56:21.652
The whole styling...
He's got taste.

56:21.687 --> 56:22.887
-That's what I'm saying.
-For sure.

56:22.922 --> 56:24.388
-I loved it.
-I loved it, too.

56:27.160 --> 56:29.627
TIM: Coming up,
Paola's wearing Roberi.

56:29.662 --> 56:31.929
(sighs)

56:31.965 --> 56:34.132
NINA: I've seen this dress,
Tim Gunn...

56:34.167 --> 56:36.400
But out of, uh...
paper lanterns?

56:36.435 --> 56:39.536
This back is really,
really good.

56:39.572 --> 56:41.705
HEIDI:
It has poetry. It is beautiful,

56:41.741 --> 56:44.475
-it looks like hair.
-I'm impressed.

56:44.510 --> 56:47.945
And I just want to underscore
how incredibly complex

56:47.981 --> 56:49.680
-this was to engineer correctly.
-You bet.

56:51.785 --> 56:54.351
TIM:
And we have Anna, wearing Brik.

56:54.387 --> 56:56.220
-ZAC: Dancing queen.
-HEIDI: <i> Oy vey.</i>

56:56.256 --> 56:58.322
I mean, really,
the only cool thing

56:58.357 --> 57:00.591
about this whole thing

57:00.626 --> 57:01.926
is really the shoulders.

57:01.961 --> 57:03.560
That was really cool and new.

57:03.596 --> 57:05.997
I mean, you can say the pants
fit nice on the booty.

57:06.032 --> 57:07.398
I mean, I guess he can tailor

57:07.433 --> 57:09.000
a nice pair of pants.
But then, why...

57:09.035 --> 57:10.935
How can he not see
that they're too short?

57:10.970 --> 57:12.770
Well, it could've been
a mistake.

57:12.806 --> 57:14.605
NINA: That's not, that's not
even what worries me.

57:14.640 --> 57:16.774
It's the overall styling.

57:16.810 --> 57:19.677
-It's very disjointed.
-Mix-match.

57:19.712 --> 57:21.545
So is this just muslin, and then
just the confetti on the...?

57:21.580 --> 57:23.080
Yeah, he just glued confetti on.

57:23.116 --> 57:24.882
I mean, it's actually, for me,
and, you know...

57:24.918 --> 57:27.118
I don't know. Maybe the sparkly
person in me, I kind of...

57:27.153 --> 57:27.985
-Oh, yeah. -...there's something
fun in there.

57:28.021 --> 57:29.420
I-I don't mind the sparkles.

57:29.455 --> 57:30.621
-I don't mind the sparkles.
-As a textile...

57:30.656 --> 57:31.422
There's a spirit.

57:34.294 --> 57:37.795
TIM: And we have Priscilla
wearing Ian.

57:37.831 --> 57:40.298
-I'm sad about this.
-Oh.

57:40.333 --> 57:41.966
ZAC: So, he went into
a lot about, like,

57:42.001 --> 57:43.868
all the work
that he did in here.

57:43.903 --> 57:46.137
So how did he do this? Was that
the fringe around the...

57:46.172 --> 57:47.571
-one of the pillows?
-TIM: I'm not altogether certain

57:47.606 --> 57:49.540
where they came from.

57:49.575 --> 57:50.908
To me, this looks like
you can buy this

57:50.944 --> 57:52.944
-on a roll at Mood.
-(snoring)

57:52.979 --> 57:54.478
But you have
to respect a designer

57:54.513 --> 57:56.981
that has a minimalist stance.

57:57.016 --> 57:58.850
I think he has good taste.

58:01.087 --> 58:03.054
Thank you very much, judges.

58:03.223 --> 58:05.756
aAne.nd Kek

58:05.791 --> 58:07.491
Thank you, all!

58:07.526 --> 58:10.928
Really today,
it's between Dexter and Erin.

58:10.964 --> 58:13.797
Erin was, in a way,
more elegant.

58:13.833 --> 58:16.800
There was such balance
in her work. Beautiful.

58:16.836 --> 58:20.004
Dexter, in a way, has more
of a cooler vibe to it.

58:20.039 --> 58:22.539
-He had a vision.
-It was effective.

58:22.575 --> 58:24.641
Yeah. We have not seen anything
like this.

58:24.677 --> 58:26.610
He's very fashion-forward.

58:26.645 --> 58:29.680
Let's talk about the designers
that we did not like.

58:29.715 --> 58:31.282
-Brik was the worst.
-To me,

58:31.317 --> 58:34.252
Brik's was more creative
than Ian's.

58:34.287 --> 58:37.088
To me, Ian's was more
sophisticated than Brik's.

58:37.123 --> 58:39.056
Creative versus sophistication.

58:39.092 --> 58:41.325
That's where
we are coming to here.

58:41.361 --> 58:43.594
Okay.
So, we've made our decision.

58:46.832 --> 58:47.965
Let's bring them back out.

58:52.438 --> 58:54.738
Designers,

58:54.774 --> 58:58.509
the six of you had the highest
and the lowest scores.

58:58.544 --> 59:00.278
One of you will be named
the winner.

59:01.881 --> 59:02.914
And one of you will be out.

59:02.949 --> 59:05.182
¶ ¶

59:08.006 --> 59:11.307
Designers, one of you
will be named the winner,

59:11.343 --> 59:12.908
and one of you will be out.

59:15.079 --> 59:17.380
This was a really great
first runway show.

59:17.415 --> 59:20.450
We love starting

59:20.485 --> 59:23.052
with an unconventional
materials challenge.

59:26.057 --> 59:26.922
Erin.

59:30.529 --> 59:33.563
Congratulations, you are the
winner of the first challenge.

59:33.598 --> 59:36.666
Thank you.
Thanks, guys. (chuckling)

59:38.203 --> 59:39.335
Are you excited?

59:39.371 --> 59:41.404
It's a really good feeling.
Yeah.

59:41.439 --> 59:43.039
HEIDI:
<i> And-and we all can't wait</i>

59:43.074 --> 59:45.141
<i> to see</i>
<i> what you're gonna do next.</i>

59:45.177 --> 59:47.177
Congratulations.
You can leave the runway.

59:47.212 --> 59:48.511
Thank you.

59:48.547 --> 59:51.714
<i> It's so wild</i>
<i> being the first winner.</i>

59:51.749 --> 59:53.749
There's no better way
to start the season.

59:53.785 --> 59:56.286
-She did it really fast. (gasps)
-And then she just made it.

59:56.321 --> 59:57.587
-What happened?
-Are you the winner?

59:57.622 --> 59:59.389
Like, I was just like...

59:59.424 --> 01:00:01.123
"Cool." (chuckles)

01:00:01.159 --> 01:00:04.427
-Yes!
-(cheering and applause)

01:00:04.462 --> 01:00:06.596
Dexter, you're in.

01:00:06.631 --> 01:00:07.463
You can leave the runway.

01:00:07.499 --> 01:00:10.567
Thank you guys so much.

01:00:10.602 --> 01:00:13.503
Tasha, you did a great job.

01:00:13.572 --> 01:00:15.305
You're in.
You can leave the runway.

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.472
Thank y'all so much. Thank you.

Thank Roberi, you're in.nk you.

01:00:23.748 --> 01:00:25.081
You can leave the runway.

01:00:25.116 --> 01:00:26.048
Thank you.

01:00:30.955 --> 01:00:32.689
Ian,

01:00:32.724 --> 01:00:35.658
your dress was not our favorite.

01:00:36.961 --> 01:00:38.461
<i> The final look was uninspiring</i>

01:00:38.496 --> 01:00:39.929
<i> and underwhelming.</i>

01:00:40.932 --> 01:00:42.064
Brik.

01:00:43.568 --> 01:00:46.402
<i> There was</i>
<i> a really big disconnect</i>

01:00:46.438 --> 01:00:47.970
<i> to your look.</i>

01:00:48.005 --> 01:00:51.574
It just did not come together.

01:00:55.213 --> 01:00:55.978
Brik...

01:00:59.284 --> 01:01:00.283
...you're in.

01:01:02.354 --> 01:01:03.919
You can leave the runway.

01:01:03.955 --> 01:01:05.622
Thank y'all.

01:01:07.559 --> 01:01:10.660
(Heidi sighs heavily)

01:01:12.731 --> 01:01:14.096
Ian, I'm sorry.
That means you're out.

01:01:14.132 --> 01:01:16.532
It must be so hard
being the first one.

01:01:16.568 --> 01:01:18.301
It's all right.
I like the dress, so...

01:01:20.739 --> 01:01:22.472
We wish you the best of luck.

01:01:22.507 --> 01:01:26.008
<i> Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

01:01:26.043 --> 01:01:27.577
IAN:
<i> I love the dress.</i>

01:01:29.614 --> 01:01:32.148
<i> I, like, can't say it enough.</i>
<i> The people</i>

01:01:32.183 --> 01:01:35.951
that I met are, like, a nice
concession prize, I guess.

01:01:35.987 --> 01:01:38.655
-We're here.
-Yeah. -Yeah.

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:40.290
-Hey...
-No...

01:01:40.325 --> 01:01:41.524
It's all good.

01:01:41.559 --> 01:01:44.460
I loved it. So...

01:01:44.496 --> 01:01:46.028
If you're proud of it,
then that's all that matters.

01:01:46.063 --> 01:01:47.430
-That's all that matters.
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:47.465 --> 01:01:49.865
-Yeah!
-Okay, group hug!

01:01:49.901 --> 01:01:52.435
-Aw! I know you don't like hugs!
-Group hug!

01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:54.771
I'm really proud that I stood up
for myself in front of them.

01:01:54.806 --> 01:01:57.907
I mean, it's intimidating.
It really is. But...

01:01:57.942 --> 01:02:00.876
<i> I would be embarrassed</i>
<i> of myself</i>

01:02:00.912 --> 01:02:03.446
if I didn't stand up for myself
and my work.

01:02:03.481 --> 01:02:05.315
(indistinct chatter)

01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:08.418
-No...
-Hi. -Hello.

01:02:08.453 --> 01:02:11.020
Ian, we're gonna miss
your spunk.

01:02:11.055 --> 01:02:13.489
-(chuckles)
-Tremendously.

01:02:13.525 --> 01:02:16.158
I have to send you to the work
room to clean out your space.

01:02:16.194 --> 01:02:18.060
-Sure. Yeah.
-Okay?

01:02:18.095 --> 01:02:22.432
-It's been good, guys! Kill it!
-ALL: Bye.

01:02:22.467 --> 01:02:24.500
It was an experience,
that's for sure.

01:02:24.536 --> 01:02:26.803
I don't regret it for a second.

01:02:29.507 --> 01:02:32.842
Mywaor <i> tis k l.aufu</i>

01:02:32.877 --> 01:02:35.345
And I'll swear by that
till the day I die.

-the north side, south side.
-Oh, wow.

01:02:48.393 --> 01:02:50.460
NATHALIA: <i> Whatever drama you</i>
<i> guys have going, just, like,</i>

01:02:50.495 --> 01:02:52.562
I don't even want to be,
like, a part of it.

01:02:52.597 --> 01:02:54.597
DEXTER: <i> I'm trying to ignore</i>
<i> Cornelius, because he's always</i>

01:02:54.632 --> 01:02:56.799
-talking ... about someone.
-(chuckles)

01:02:56.835 --> 01:02:59.702
-My skirt has a hole in it and I
can't even repair it. -(yelping)

01:02:59.738 --> 01:03:02.238
This is not the time
for this kind of bull(bleep).

01:03:02.273 --> 01:03:04.607
-She looks great.
-That is my kind of girl.

01:03:04.642 --> 01:03:06.275
It looks shabby.

01:03:06.310 --> 01:03:08.511
It's like weird officewear.

01:03:08.546 --> 01:03:10.145
It's kind of sad.
