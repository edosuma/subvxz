WEBVTT

00:09.959 --> 00:10.750
HEY.

00:12.834 --> 00:14.750
YEAH. I GOT SOME STUFF

00:15.667 --> 00:17.708
3:00?

00:17.708 --> 00:20.834
YEAH, I KNOW WHEN
HETSON'S CLASS IS,
JOEY.

00:20.834 --> 00:22.708
I KNOW.
I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU

00:22.708 --> 00:24.333
TO FEEL WEIRD
OR SOMETHING.

00:24.333 --> 00:26.500
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NO FUN WITHOUT YOU.

00:26.500 --> 00:29.333
NO ONE
TO CONTEST MY OPINIONS
WITH SNARKY FEEDBACK.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.458
I'M STARTING TO FEEL
SMART OR SOMETHING.

00:30.458 --> 00:31.750
YEAH, WELL,
FINALS SHOULD NIP

00:31.750 --> 00:33.708
THAT PESKY EGO
IN THE BUTT.

00:35.291 --> 00:37.125
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS SEMESTER
IS ALMOST OVER.

00:37.125 --> 00:39.125
I KNOW.

00:39.125 --> 00:40.333
ARE YOU GOING HOME
FOR THE HOLIDAYS?

00:40.333 --> 00:44.250
WHAT COULD BE HOMIER
THAN THIS CLEAN,
WELL-LIGHTED PLACE?

00:44.250 --> 00:46.542
SERIOUSLY.
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

00:46.542 --> 00:47.875
DOES IT MAKE
A DIFFERENCE?

00:47.875 --> 00:50.041
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

00:50.041 --> 00:51.708
CAPESIDE.

00:51.708 --> 00:53.542
(CHUCKLES)
WHAT?

00:53.542 --> 00:55.583
NOTHING.
IT'S JUST...

00:55.583 --> 00:56.708
CAPESIDE.

00:56.708 --> 00:57.917
I GUESS
THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT.

00:57.917 --> 00:59.041
ABOUT RIGHT FOR WHAT?

00:59.041 --> 01:00.000
HEY, RELAX.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.041
NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

01:01.041 --> 01:02.208
HAVE YOU EVER EVEN
BEEN TO CAPESIDE?

01:02.208 --> 01:03.750
THEY DON'T LET MY KIND
GO THAT FAR EAST.

01:03.750 --> 01:06.000
WELL, THANK GOODNESS
WE HAVE NEUTRAL GROUND
TO SPAR ON.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.375
YEAH. YEAH.
WE'RE A REGULAR
SAM AND DIANE--

01:08.375 --> 01:09.708

FANCY BOOK LEARNING.

01:10.917 --> 01:13.041
YOU KNOW,
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG
ABOUT ME, EDDIE DOLING.

01:13.041 --> 01:14.542
I'M A GIRL FROM
THE WRONG SIDE OF THE TRACKS.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.041
YOU DON'T WANNA MESS
WITH THE LIKES OF ME.

01:16.041 --> 01:17.500
I DON'T KNOW.
I KINDA LIKE IT

01:17.500 --> 01:19.375
WHEN YOU GET
ALL "FOXFIRE" ON ME.

01:19.375 --> 01:21.500
NOTHIN' LIKE
A FANCY GIRL
SLUMMIN' IT.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.291

01:24.291 --> 01:26.041
YOU'RE VERY LUCKY
I HAVE CLASS RIGHT NOW,

01:26.041 --> 01:28.417

01:28.417 --> 01:31.083
I WILL BE HERE.
I'M WORKIN'
A DOUBLE TODAY,

01:31.083 --> 01:33.917
AND DON'T YOU HAVE
ANYTHING BETTER TO DO
ON YOUR NIGHT OFF

01:33.917 --> 01:35.583
THAN LOLL AROUND
YOUR PLACE OF WORK?

01:37.834 --> 01:39.917
YOU KNOW,
IT JUST SO HAPPENS
THAT HELL'S BELLES

01:39.917 --> 01:41.583
IS GOING TO THOROUGHLY
ROCK THE HOUSE DOWN.

01:41.583 --> 01:42.959
MMM.

01:42.959 --> 01:45.250
KINDA LIKE
THE ONION RINGS.

01:46.875 --> 01:47.959
I'LL SEE YOU
LATER, JOEY.

02:43.542 --> 02:46.291
SO WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH YOU AND
THIS DAVID FELLOW?

02:46.291 --> 02:48.000
KEEP TO YOUR OWN
FURTIVE GROPINGS,

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.834
OH, JACK.

02:51.834 --> 02:52.875
NO, IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

02:52.875 --> 02:54.542
I MEAN, THERE WAS--
THERE WAS COFFEE,

02:54.542 --> 02:55.542
THERE WAS TALKING,

02:55.542 --> 02:57.667
AND I DON'T
WANNA JINX IT.

02:57.667 --> 03:00.834
AW, WHY SO SHY?

03:00.834 --> 03:03.333
COME ON, SOMEBODY'S
GOTTA BE GETTING SOME.

03:03.333 --> 03:04.667
GOD.

03:04.667 --> 03:05.834
CRACKING THIS C.J. CASE

03:05.834 --> 03:07.625
IS PROVING
FAR TOO DIFFICULT

03:07.625 --> 03:08.834
FOR THE DELICATE
LIKES OF ME.

03:08.834 --> 03:10.000
EASY, EASY.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.667
YOUR SEXUAL
FRUSTRATION'S
HITTING A VEIN.

03:11.667 --> 03:15.834
ANYWAY, WE'RE MEETING
IN THE CAFETERIA
AFTER CLASS.

03:17.625 --> 03:18.542
CAN I COME?

03:19.500 --> 03:20.750
C.J. WILL
PROBABLY BE THERE.

03:20.750 --> 03:23.250
JEN, DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'VE GIVEN THIS ONE

03:23.250 --> 03:24.834
THE OLD COLLEGE TRY?

03:24.834 --> 03:26.291
THIS MUCH EFFORT'S
BENEATH YOU.

03:26.291 --> 03:27.834
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF,
DIDN'T YOU?

03:27.834 --> 03:32.375
OH, YOU CAN'T
HOLD THE ULTIMATUMS
OF PARTY JEN AGAINST ME.

03:32.375 --> 03:33.917
I WAS WEARING A WIG.
I WAS FEELING CRAZY.

03:33.917 --> 03:35.208
ALL RIGHT.

03:35.208 --> 03:36.375
HEY, I TELL YOU WHAT.
BRING GRAMS, TOO.

03:36.375 --> 03:38.000
MAYBE I WILL.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.417
Freeman:
AFTERNOON, EVERYONE.

03:39.417 --> 03:41.542
I WANTED TO
START CLASS TODAY
BY TELLING YOU ALL

03:41.542 --> 03:44.000
THAT YOU WON'T BE
SEEING ME AFTER FINALS.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.208
THE PUBLICATION
OF MY CRITICAL ESSAYS

03:46.208 --> 03:49.208
HAS SECURED MY ACADEMIC
VISITATION IN CHICAGO.

03:49.208 --> 03:50.667
SO I'LL BE
LEAVING BOSTON BAY

03:50.667 --> 03:51.792
AT THE END
OF THE SEMESTER.

03:51.792 --> 03:53.208
SINCE OUR TIME
IS LIMITED,

03:53.208 --> 03:54.750
I WANTED TO
INVITE ALL OF YOU

03:54.750 --> 03:57.208
TO THE BOOK-SIGNING
TONIGHT OVER AT
WINTHROP HALL.

03:57.208 --> 03:58.083
YOU'VE BEEN
A GREAT CLASS,

03:58.083 --> 03:59.208
ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

03:59.208 --> 04:01.625
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

04:03.500 --> 04:04.834
NO. I HAD NO IDEA.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.250
AAH.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.250
(SIGHS)

04:12.250 --> 04:13.125
OK, OK.

04:16.458 --> 04:17.959
YOU DECIDED TO BLESS
THE ORPHANS OF THE WORLD

04:17.959 --> 04:19.250
WITH YOUR BETSY JOHNSONS?

04:19.250 --> 04:21.250
HARDLY. I AM
AUDITIONING OUTFITS,

04:21.250 --> 04:22.750
AND EVERYTHING IS
FAILING MISERABLY.

04:22.750 --> 04:25.333
WHERE HAVE ALL
MY SEX CLOTHES GONE?

04:25.333 --> 04:28.291
PACEY WITTER
HAS PILLAGED
MY FASHION SENSE.

04:28.291 --> 04:29.542
YOU MEAN THERE
ARE CLOTHES OUT THERE

04:29.542 --> 04:30.875
THAT ACTUALLY SHOW OFF
YOUR CHEST EVEN MORE?

04:30.875 --> 04:31.917
YES.

04:31.917 --> 04:33.208
AND QUITE FRANKLY,

04:33.208 --> 04:35.041
THE GIRLS ARE
FEELING SHUNNED.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.542
THE BAND IS PLAYING
TONIGHT AT YOUR
LITTLE DIVE BAR,

04:36.542 --> 04:37.708
AND I WANT THEM
TO BE RESPLENDENT.

04:37.708 --> 04:39.125
I KNOW.
I WOULDN'T MISS IT
FOR THE WORLD.

04:39.125 --> 04:40.583
IN FACT, I'M NOT
EVEN WORKING TONIGHT.

04:40.583 --> 04:42.500
SO YOU WILL HAVE MY FULL
AND UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.041
OOH, WELL, MIGHT BE NICE

04:44.041 --> 04:45.375
IF YOU SHOWED YOUR FACE
AROUND THESE PARTS.

04:45.375 --> 04:46.959
I KNOW I'M USUALLY
LOW MAINTENANCE AND ALL.

04:46.959 --> 04:48.083
I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR.

04:48.083 --> 04:50.250
BESIDES, I FIGURE
THAT YOU AND PACEY

04:50.250 --> 04:51.792
WOULD APPRECIATE
THE PRIVATE TIME.

04:51.792 --> 04:52.959
YEAH, WELL.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.250
THAT WAS A GREAT HELP.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.375
NOW I'VE DUMPED PACEY
4 MONTHS TOO LATE

04:56.375 --> 04:58.083
AND NOT A SLUTTY FROCK
HAS SURVIVED.

04:58.083 --> 04:58.792
NOT A ONE, I TELL YOU.

04:58.792 --> 05:00.250
WHAT?

05:00.250 --> 05:01.792
WHEN DID YOU DUMP PACEY?

05:01.792 --> 05:04.500
HELLO? MID-MID-LIFE CRISIS,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.291
JEEZ, JOEY, WOULD IT
KILL YOU TO KEEP UP?

05:07.792 --> 05:10.125
LOOK, AUDREY, I'M SORRY.
I'VE BEEN--

05:10.125 --> 05:12.291
WAIT, WHEN DID
THIS HAPPEN?

05:12.291 --> 05:14.333
THE HORROR
THAT WAS HALLOWEEN.

05:14.333 --> 05:15.375
WHATEVER.

05:15.375 --> 05:16.625
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

05:16.625 --> 05:19.208
AUDREY, HOW COULD YOU
NOT TELL ME ABOUT THIS?

05:19.208 --> 05:21.625
LOOK, I KNOW
I'VE BEEN GONE A LOT,

05:21.625 --> 05:23.458
BUT A LITTLE
BATHROOM SIDEBAR
MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN ORDER.

05:23.458 --> 05:25.291
I DON'T KNOW.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.208
I GUESS I JUST FIGURED
THAT YOU'D HEAR IT
FROM PACEY

05:27.208 --> 05:29.458
IN SOME "HOW HAS LIFE
BEEN SINCE YOU?"
CONVERSATION.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.166
OF COURSE NOT.

05:31.166 --> 05:32.750
WE LIVE TOGETHER.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.500
I MEAN, JUST
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
RUNNING AROUND

05:34.500 --> 05:35.875
DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR YOU.

05:35.875 --> 05:36.959
YEAH, WELL, LISTEN,

05:36.959 --> 05:38.333
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT

05:38.333 --> 05:39.834
TO HEAR YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND
WISDOM AT THE TIME,

05:39.834 --> 05:42.208
BUT NOW, I'M KINDA DONE
RELIVING IT.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.708
OK.

05:47.708 --> 05:49.000
Jen: JACK, HAVE YOU
EVER NOTICED HOW
MUCH YOUR APARTMENT

05:49.000 --> 05:51.041
LOOKS LIKE THE ONE
ON MY TWO DADS?

05:51.041 --> 05:52.750
I THINK IT'S
THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE.

05:52.750 --> 05:54.792
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU AND PACEY
ARE EMBROILED

05:54.792 --> 05:56.500
IN SOME WHOSE SPERM
IS WHOSE BATTLE,

05:56.500 --> 05:58.333
BUT WOULD YOU MAYBE WANT
TO GO OUT TONIGHT, JACK?

06:00.458 --> 06:02.500
I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT YOU JUST DID THAT.

06:02.500 --> 06:03.583
WHAT?

06:03.583 --> 06:05.625
NO HEDGING,
NO SUBTEXT.

06:05.625 --> 06:07.000
NO HORRIBLE PUNS.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.667
GAYS HAVE IT SO EASY.

06:08.667 --> 06:10.166
STRAIGHT BOYS
ARE NEVER SO...

06:10.166 --> 06:11.166
STRAIGHT.

06:11.166 --> 06:13.708
LOVE TO.
COOL.

06:13.708 --> 06:15.500
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
EMMA AND AUDREY
ARE PLAYING TONIGHT.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.041
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:17.041 --> 06:18.250
WE SHOULD GO TO THAT.
IS THAT OK?

06:18.250 --> 06:19.542
AND THEN AFTERWARDS,
WE'LL DO SOMETHING ELSE?

06:19.542 --> 06:21.041
YEAH.
Jen: OK, WAIT, WAIT.

06:21.041 --> 06:22.875
GO WITH ME HERE
FOR A SECOND, UM,
BEFORE C.J. GETS HERE.

06:22.875 --> 06:25.041
SO WE'RE GONNA GO SEE
THE PRETTY GIRLS PLAY.

06:25.041 --> 06:26.500
WE CAN ASK C.J.
TO JOIN US ON THIS--

06:26.500 --> 06:29.208
THIS VERY INNOCENT
GROUP OUTING.

06:29.208 --> 06:31.542
OR, YOU KNOW, WHY BOTHER
WITH THE SUBTLETIES?

06:31.542 --> 06:33.041
WE CAN JUST, UH,
CLUB HIM OVER THE HEAD

06:33.041 --> 06:34.291
AND DRAG HIM OUT.

06:34.291 --> 06:35.417
JACK, WORK WITH ME HERE.

06:35.417 --> 06:36.542
David: NO, NO, NO.

06:36.542 --> 06:37.708
WE SHOULD DEFINITELY
ASK HIM TO COME.

06:37.708 --> 06:39.542
IT'D BE FUN
IF WE ALL WENT.

06:39.542 --> 06:41.375
IT'S JUST, UH...

06:41.375 --> 06:43.875
WELL, C.J. DOESN'T
REALLY DATE.

06:43.875 --> 06:46.500
WHAT? DOES HE JUST
JUMP STRAIGHT
INTO THE SACK?

06:46.500 --> 06:47.708
COFFEE TO CONDOMS?
WHAT ARE WE
TALKING HERE?

06:47.708 --> 06:49.166
UM, NO.

06:49.166 --> 06:50.834
YOU SEE, I MEAN,
HE DOESN'T DATE AT ALL.

06:50.834 --> 06:53.083
WELL, HIS LIFE IS
SORT OF COMPLICATED.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.208
HE, UM...

06:55.208 --> 06:57.000
NAH, I SHOULDN'T
REALLY TALK ABOUT IT.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.041
WHATEVER IT IS,
I'M SURE IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

06:58.041 --> 06:59.417
COME ON, BRING IT ON.
PLEASE?

06:59.417 --> 07:00.959
JEN, WILL YOU STOP
USING MY FRIEND

07:00.959 --> 07:02.041
AS YOUR DEEP THROAT,
PLEASE?

07:03.792 --> 07:05.208
UH, YEAH.

07:05.208 --> 07:06.792
F-F-FORGET I SAID
THAT ONE.

07:06.792 --> 07:07.792
(CLEARS THROAT)

07:07.792 --> 07:09.041
HERE COMES C.J.

07:09.041 --> 07:10.542
OH, HEY.
HEY.

07:10.542 --> 07:13.041
UM, LOOK, THIS IS
TOTALLY LAST MINUTE,

07:13.041 --> 07:15.125
BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE
THAT YOU'D WANNA
COME WITH US TONIGHT

07:15.125 --> 07:17.250
AND SEE OUR FRIEND
PLAY IN A BAND?

07:17.250 --> 07:19.291
IT'S AUDREY.
YOU KNOW AUDREY.

07:19.291 --> 07:20.917
THE ONE THAT'S
GUARANTEED TO ENTERTAIN.

07:20.917 --> 07:22.208
I RECALL.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.291
YEAH, SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

07:23.291 --> 07:24.667
EXCELLENT.

07:26.917 --> 07:28.250
JACK.

07:28.250 --> 07:31.083
UM, SOON-TO-BE-EXTINCT
FREEMAN APPROACHES

07:31.083 --> 07:33.917
AND KINDA LOOKS LIKE
HE NEEDS TO PEE.

07:33.917 --> 07:35.583
David: I THINK MAYBE
HE JUST WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.

07:35.583 --> 07:37.083
YEAH.

07:37.083 --> 07:38.250
UH, EXCUSE ME, GUYS.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.750
I'M SORRY.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.250
WANNA SIT?
YEP.

07:45.250 --> 07:47.166
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T
MEAN TO INTERRUPT
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.375
THAT'S OKAY.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

07:48.375 --> 07:49.667
I, UH--
PLENTY OF TIME TO EAT.

07:52.291 --> 07:53.750
SO CLASS TODAY,
HOW ABOUT THAT?

07:56.125 --> 07:58.959
UM, JACK...

07:58.959 --> 08:01.500
I KEEP THINKING
ABOUT THAT FIRST
CONVERSATION WE HAD,

08:01.500 --> 08:03.458
WHEN YOU SAID THAT
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME

08:03.458 --> 08:05.000
YOU'D FELT MOTIVATED
IN A LONG WHILE.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.583
I'D HATE TO THINK
THAT I'D TAKEN AWAY

08:06.583 --> 08:08.417
THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE
YOU DESERVE.

08:08.417 --> 08:10.291
WELL, I'LL KEEP ON
APPLYING MYSELF.

08:12.750 --> 08:15.458
LOOK, UM, NEXT WEEK
IS READING WEEK,

08:15.458 --> 08:16.583
AND AFTER THAT,
THERE'S FINALS,

08:16.583 --> 08:18.125
AND AFTER THAT, WELL...

08:18.125 --> 08:19.333
I'M GONE.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.542
IT WOULD JUST--

08:22.542 --> 08:23.542
IT WOULD MEAN
A LOT TO ME

08:23.542 --> 08:24.708
IF YOU WERE THERE
TONIGHT, JACK.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.458
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

08:35.667 --> 08:38.375
I HOPE YOU GUYS
PACKED CONDOMS AND
TOOTHPASTE THIS MORNING

08:38.375 --> 08:40.500
'CAUSE WE'RE TAKING
A LITTLE TRIP.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.375
YOU ALL PASSED
YOUR SERIES 7s,

08:43.375 --> 08:45.000
SOME OF YOU
WITH FLYING COLORS,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.333
YOU SMARTY-PANTS
PANSIES.

08:47.333 --> 08:49.750
SO TONIGHT,
WE CELEBRATE.

08:49.750 --> 08:51.166
NEW ORLEANS?
HOW ABOUT THAT, HUH?

08:51.166 --> 08:53.458
YES, WE ARE SO
OBNOXIOUSLY WEALTHY

08:53.458 --> 08:55.458
WE ARE FLYING
TO THE BIG EASY

08:55.458 --> 08:57.333
TO INDULGE IN
ALL ITS PLEASURES

08:57.333 --> 08:59.667
FOR 24 SICKENING HOURS.

08:59.667 --> 09:02.000
SO DON'T TELL ME
YOU HAVE TO CALL YOUR
MOMMIES OR ANYTHING.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.041
JUST ADMIT
THAT FIRST CLASS,
FREE HOTEL ROOMS,

09:05.041 --> 09:07.041
AND GOOD OLD
SOUTHERN GIRLS

09:07.041 --> 09:09.750
WHO LEARNED TO DRINK
BEFORE YOU
PLAYED NINTENDO

09:09.750 --> 09:11.875
ARE ALL TOO GOOD
TO PASS UP.

09:11.875 --> 09:12.875
PACK IT UP, GENTLEMEN.

09:12.875 --> 09:14.083
LOGAN, 1 HOUR.

09:15.083 --> 09:16.208
Man: YEAH, BABY.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.750
(MAN LAUGHS)

09:31.375 --> 09:33.417
Woman: SO YOU GUYS ARE HERE
FOR THE WEEKEND, HUH?

09:33.417 --> 09:34.417
Pacey: JUST THE NIGHT
ACTUALLY.

09:34.417 --> 09:35.667
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.500
THERE'S A LOT OF FUN
TO BE HAD HERE.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.375
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

09:39.375 --> 09:40.708
I COULD SHOW YOU AROUND.

09:40.708 --> 09:41.500
YOU KNOW, I'VE ACTUALLY
BEEN HERE BEFORE.

09:41.500 --> 09:42.500
OH.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.500
YEAH, MY GIRLFRIEND AND I,

09:43.500 --> 09:45.166
WE CAME THROUGH HERE
THIS SUMMER.

09:45.166 --> 09:46.125
SO YOU HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND.

09:46.125 --> 09:48.208
OH, NO. NO, NO.
SHE DUMPED ME.

09:48.208 --> 09:49.542
HEH.

09:49.542 --> 09:50.625
WELL, I THINK MY FRIENDS
ARE WAITING FOR ME,

09:50.625 --> 09:52.375
BUT IT'S NICE
MEETING YOU, PERCY.

10:00.041 --> 10:01.041
HI, THERE.

10:01.041 --> 10:03.417
I DON'T DO GUYS
IN MOURNING.

10:03.417 --> 10:05.125
Rich: WITTER, MAN.

10:05.125 --> 10:07.750
YOU ARE PATHETIC,

10:07.750 --> 10:10.417
AND HERE I THOUGHT YOU'D
BE MY ONLY COMPETITION.

10:10.417 --> 10:11.625
YOU'RE MAKING THIS
TOO EASY.

10:11.625 --> 10:13.583
WELL, LOOK, RINALDI,

10:13.583 --> 10:14.583
IT WOULD BE A LOT DIFFERENT

10:14.583 --> 10:15.750
IF I WAS ACTUALLY
IN THIS GAME,

10:15.750 --> 10:17.083
WHICH I'M NOT

10:17.083 --> 10:19.291
BECAUSE WOMEN DO ACTUALLY
LIKE THE SENSITIVE TYPE.

10:19.291 --> 10:21.917
YEAH, OK,

10:21.917 --> 10:23.834
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S
BEEN WORKING FOR ME.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.291
Rich: RIGHT?

10:26.291 --> 10:27.417
(RICH LAUGHS)

10:33.458 --> 10:35.959
EVERYTHING SEEMS MAGICAL

10:35.959 --> 10:37.959
WHEN YOU SEE IT FROM
THE OTHER SIDE, RIGHT?

10:37.959 --> 10:41.083
THE COMMAND WITH WHICH
YOU POUR IS STAGGERING.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.250
THANK YOU.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.625
HOW'S CLASS TODAY?

10:43.625 --> 10:45.583
THE USUAL.

10:45.583 --> 10:46.792
WE'RE ENDING
GRAVITY'S RAINBOW,

10:46.792 --> 10:48.458
AND HETSON SPENT
A GOOD 5 MINUTES

10:48.458 --> 10:49.625
INSISTING I'D
NEVER UNDERSTAND

10:49.625 --> 10:51.083
THE EXPERIMENTAL
RAMBLINGS.

10:51.083 --> 10:52.458
WELL, THAT'S SILLY.

10:52.458 --> 10:55.750
DIANE CHAMBERS
IS AN EXTREMELY
WELL-READ CHARACTER.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.250
I'M SURE
SHE WOULD HAVE
SCHOOLED HETSON.

10:57.250 --> 11:00.917
AND, YOU KNOW,
YOUR WHOLE SAM-DIANE
CLASS ARGUMENT THING,

11:00.917 --> 11:02.667
IT'S VERY WEAK.

11:02.667 --> 11:04.375
HE DEFINITELY MADE
MORE MONEY THAN HER.

11:04.375 --> 11:05.959
YEAH, AND I MAKE
MORE MONEY THAN YOUR
WORTHINGTON COLLEAGUES

11:05.959 --> 11:07.458
WHO DON'T NEED A JOB,
BUT THAT DOESN'T PUT US

11:07.458 --> 11:08.708
IN THE SAME BRACKET,
NOW DOES IT?

11:08.708 --> 11:10.458
HEY, CUTE BAR BOY.

11:10.458 --> 11:11.333
GIVE ME A SHOT,
WILL YA?

11:11.333 --> 11:13.333
I GOT THE SHAKES.

11:13.333 --> 11:17.333
YOU ARE SO AWESOME
FOR COMING
TO SEE ME PLAY,

11:17.333 --> 11:18.875
AND HERE,
BUY A ROUND OF SHOTS

11:18.875 --> 11:21.250
FOR THE FUTURE
BOYFRIENDS OF AMERICA.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.542
Audrey: MMM.

11:24.542 --> 11:26.708
(CHOKING)
OH, GOD. AH--

11:26.708 --> 11:27.834
GOD, WHO DID
HER PARENTS BUY OFF

11:27.834 --> 11:29.000
TO GET HER
INTO WORTHINGTON?

11:30.083 --> 11:31.959
YOU'RE MORE ACERBIC
THAN USUAL TONIGHT,

11:31.959 --> 11:33.708
IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.

11:33.708 --> 11:34.875
EVERYTHING OK?

11:34.875 --> 11:36.000
YEAH.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
I'M SORRY. I JUST--

11:37.000 --> 11:38.333
I HATE WORKING DOUBLES,

11:38.333 --> 11:40.333
AND I--I DON'T LIKE
WORKING WITH SAM.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.166
NO ONE TO FLIRT WITH, HUH?

11:42.166 --> 11:44.375
YEAH, OR CLUMSILY INSULT,

11:44.375 --> 11:45.834
WHICHEVER YOU PREFER.

11:47.625 --> 11:50.041
WELL, I'LL COME
BACK UP LATER.

11:50.041 --> 11:52.375
RIGHT NOW, I HAVE TO
GO STROKE AUDREY'S EGO.

11:52.375 --> 11:53.458
SOUNDS ENTICING.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.417
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)

11:56.417 --> 11:57.458
HEY.

11:57.458 --> 11:59.333
Audrey:
HI, SWEETIE.

11:59.333 --> 12:00.458
OH, GOOD, GOOD.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.375
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

12:02.375 --> 12:04.583
Freeman:
WELL, THANKS FOR COMING.
HOPE YOU ENJOY.

12:10.041 --> 12:11.041
JACK, YOU CAME.

12:11.041 --> 12:12.583
YEAH.

12:12.583 --> 12:14.000
I, UH...

12:14.000 --> 12:15.708
I DON'T LIKE TO LET
FREE FOOD GO TO WASTE.

12:15.708 --> 12:17.708
WELL, WHATEVER THE REASON,
I'M GLAD.

12:19.375 --> 12:21.208
IT LOOKS LIKE
A LOT OF PEOPLE
SUPPORT YOUR DECISION.

12:21.208 --> 12:24.417
EH, SLOW NIGHT
ON CAMPUS MAYBE.

12:24.417 --> 12:27.333
IT'S TRICKY PUTTING
TOGETHER PROJECTS
LIKE THIS BOOK.

12:27.333 --> 12:28.750
THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE
A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE

12:28.750 --> 12:30.083
WHO'LL THINK THAT IT'S
BATHROOM MATERIAL,

12:30.083 --> 12:32.417
BUT I ALWAYS HELD OUT
THE NAIVE BELIEF

12:32.417 --> 12:34.875
THAT THERE WOULD BE
A READER OR TWO

12:34.875 --> 12:37.291
WHO MIGHT FIND
SOMETHING STIMULATING

12:37.291 --> 12:38.959
BEYOND EASY
CULTURAL REFERENCES.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.417
YEAH, SOME OF
MY FRIENDS ASSUMED

12:40.417 --> 12:41.917
THAT YOUR CLASS WAS
CULTURAL CLIFF NOTES

12:41.917 --> 12:43.083
WHICH WOULD
PRETTY MUCH MAKE IT

12:43.083 --> 12:44.583
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY,
I GUESS.

12:46.208 --> 12:47.583
DID YOU FEEL THAT WAY?

12:47.583 --> 12:50.792
ALL THINGS ASIDE,
DID I EVER SEEM
LESS THAN RIVETED?

12:57.417 --> 13:00.250
UM, Y-YOUR WIFE, UM...

13:00.250 --> 13:01.417
MUST NOT BE TOO PSYCHED

13:01.417 --> 13:03.208
MOVING TO CHICAGO
IN THE HEIGHT OF WINTER.

13:03.208 --> 13:05.291
ACTUALLY, SHE'S NOT GOING
TO MAKE THE MOVE WITH ME.

13:08.417 --> 13:09.500
I'M--I'M SORRY.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.583
WELL, LET'S--LET'S NOT.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.625
I CAN TALK IN CIRCLES
ABOUT WHERE I WENT WRONG,

13:13.625 --> 13:16.291
AND A MAUDLIN FREEMAN
ISN'T GONNA DO
EITHER OF US ANY GOOD.

13:16.291 --> 13:17.291
YEAH.

13:18.458 --> 13:19.667
SO I GOTTA ASK.

13:19.667 --> 13:20.750
WHY DID YOU
DECIDE TO COME?

13:20.750 --> 13:22.458
DON'T YOU HAVE
SOMEWHERE TO BE?

13:22.458 --> 13:24.333
UM.

13:24.333 --> 13:25.792
NO, NO. I--

13:25.792 --> 13:26.959
I HAVE SOME TIME.

13:26.959 --> 13:28.291
THAT'S GREAT.

13:28.291 --> 13:30.041
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO SOME PEOPLE.

13:30.041 --> 13:32.166
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IS KEEPING JACK, DAVID.

13:32.166 --> 13:34.291
I'M SURE IT'S--
IT'S A HAIR-RELATED ISSUE.

13:34.291 --> 13:35.500
NAH, IT'S OK.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.583
IT'S FLATTERING TO THINK

13:36.583 --> 13:37.458
THAT EACH CAREFULLY
MISPLACED STRAND

13:37.458 --> 13:38.458
MIGHT BE FOR ME.

13:38.458 --> 13:39.834
AWW.

13:39.834 --> 13:41.333
I'M GONNA HEAD UP
TO THE BAR.

13:41.333 --> 13:42.333
YOU GUYS NEED ANYTHING?

13:42.333 --> 13:43.375
NO, I'M GOOD.
I'M FINE.

13:47.458 --> 13:50.250
WELL, I'M GLAD
THAT YOU CAME TONIGHT.

13:50.250 --> 13:53.291
I KNOW THAT
THIS MIGHT NOT
REALLY BE YOUR THING.

13:53.291 --> 13:54.291
HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT?

13:54.291 --> 13:56.625
I'VE NOTHING
AGAINST GOOD COMPANY...

13:56.625 --> 14:00.000
AND I GUESS I CAN'T
SPEAK TO THE QUALITY
OF THE MUSIC YET, BUT...

14:00.000 --> 14:04.500
OH, WELL, AUDREY
IS NOTHING IF NOT
A STELLAR PERFORMER.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.500
HOW'S SHE BEEN LATELY?

14:05.500 --> 14:07.166
Jen: AUDREY?

14:07.166 --> 14:08.208
YEAH.
GREAT. GOOD.

14:08.208 --> 14:10.708
WHOO! AAH!

14:12.375 --> 14:14.000
WELL, MAYBE NOT
THE GREATEST OF GREATS,

14:14.000 --> 14:15.750
BUT I WOULD GIVE HER
A SOLID GOOD.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.500
WHY DO YOU ASK?

14:20.500 --> 14:22.667
WELL, SHE SEEMS LIKE
SHE MIGHT BE
A LITTLE DEPRESSED.

14:24.959 --> 14:26.542
SHE DOESN'T
LOOK DEPRESSED.

14:26.542 --> 14:28.458
WELL, IT'S EASY
NOT TO LOOK IT

14:28.458 --> 14:31.291
WHEN YOU'RE DOING
YOU'RE DAMNDEST
NOT TO FEEL IT...

14:31.291 --> 14:33.250
OR ANYTHING,
FOR THAT MATTER.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.500
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

14:40.375 --> 14:41.375
HELLO.

14:41.375 --> 14:42.917
UH, DAVID, HEY.
UH, IT'S ME.

14:42.917 --> 14:44.208
LOOK, I AM SO SORRY.

14:44.208 --> 14:46.041
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY?

14:46.041 --> 14:48.583
UH, NO, NOT EXACTLY.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.375
SHOULD I CALL
THE POLICE MAYBE?

14:50.375 --> 14:51.417
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU CAN'T SAY

14:51.417 --> 14:52.458
IN FRONT OF
THE KIDNAPPERS?

14:52.458 --> 14:54.417
I'M COMING. I PROMISE.

14:54.417 --> 14:57.750
I JUST GOT SUCKED
INTO THIS NIGHTMARE
ACADEMIC SCHMOOZE-FEST.

14:57.750 --> 14:58.917
I HAVE, LIKE, 2 MORE
PROFOUND THINGS TO SAY,

14:58.917 --> 15:00.250
AND I'M OUT OF HERE.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.375
I SWEAR.

15:01.375 --> 15:02.458
HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

15:02.458 --> 15:03.583
UH, C.J.'s HERE,

15:03.583 --> 15:04.667
AND YOUR FRIENDS
HAVE ALL MASTERED

15:04.667 --> 15:06.000
THE ART OF POLITE
CONVERSATION.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.417
SO, I WILL SEE YOU
WHEN I SEE YOU.

15:07.417 --> 15:08.542
ALL RIGHT, COOL.
I'LL SEE YA.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.250
HOW YOU DOIN'?

15:22.250 --> 15:23.375
FINE.

15:23.375 --> 15:24.959
I DIDN'T ASK
HOW YOU WERE LOOKING.

15:24.959 --> 15:26.083
I ASKED HOW
YOU WERE DOIN'.

15:26.083 --> 15:28.250
OH, COME ON, RICH.

15:28.250 --> 15:29.750
EVEN I GOTTA STOP YOU
ON THAT ONE.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.250
I MEAN, WHO SAYS THAT?

15:31.250 --> 15:32.708
YOUR FRIEND
DOES APPARENTLY.

15:32.708 --> 15:34.583
OH, NO.
HE'S NOT MY FRIEND.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.000
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M HIS BOSS.

15:36.000 --> 15:36.917
RICH RINALDI.

15:38.417 --> 15:39.708
I'M DENISE.

15:39.708 --> 15:43.083
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL NAME
FOR A BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

15:43.083 --> 15:46.583
I THINK DENISE MEANS DRAMA
IN ITS GREEK ORIGIN,

15:46.583 --> 15:48.917
AND MIGHT I SAY, DENISE,

15:48.917 --> 15:51.917
THAT YOU HAVE BREASTS
THAT ARE BEGGING
TO BE TOUCHED.

15:51.917 --> 15:53.750
OH, THAT'S
A COINCIDENCE,

15:53.750 --> 15:55.458
SINCE YOU APPARENTLY
HAVE TESTICLES

15:55.458 --> 15:57.125
THAT ARE BEGGING
TO BE CASTRATED.

15:57.125 --> 15:58.917
OK, THEN.

15:58.917 --> 16:01.625
I'LL TAKE
MY GOODS ELSEWHERE.

16:01.625 --> 16:02.834
PLEASE DO.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.375
YOU KNOW, I THINK RICH
ACTUALLY MEANS SLIMEBALL

16:07.375 --> 16:08.458
IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM,

16:08.458 --> 16:09.875
BUT I'D HAVE TO CHECK
THE BOOKS ON THAT.

16:11.125 --> 16:12.083
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

16:12.083 --> 16:13.834
I'M PACEY,

16:13.834 --> 16:15.959
AND I AM TRULY
SORRY FOR THAT,

16:15.959 --> 16:17.625
THOUGH I'M SURE YOU'RE
USED TO HAVING MEN SAYING

16:17.625 --> 16:19.625
ALL KINDS OF
INAPPROPRIATE THINGS
TO YOU ALL THE TIME.

16:19.625 --> 16:21.166
I AM.

16:21.166 --> 16:22.291
I'M NOT USED
TO THEM LEAVING

16:22.291 --> 16:24.458
THEIR CONSIDERABLY
MORE ATTRACTIVE

16:24.458 --> 16:25.583
AND LIKABLE
FRIENDS BEHIND.

16:29.166 --> 16:30.333
MISS ME?

16:30.333 --> 16:31.792
HOW COULD I WHEN I'VE
BEEN WAITING ON YOU

16:31.792 --> 16:33.083
AND YOUR FRIENDS
ALL NIGHT, YOU KNOW?

16:33.083 --> 16:34.500
GOOD POINT.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.458
SO WHAT ARE YOU
DOING AFTER?

16:35.458 --> 16:36.667
TONIGHT?

16:36.667 --> 16:37.792
WELL, YEAH, I MEAN,

16:37.792 --> 16:38.792
I KNOW WHENEVER
I GET OFF WORK

16:38.792 --> 16:39.959
THERE'S NOTHING
MORE DEPRESSING

16:39.959 --> 16:41.333
THAN TRYING TO GO
DIRECTLY ASLEEP

16:41.333 --> 16:44.834
WITH VISIONS OF DRUNKARDS
DANCING IN MY HEAD, SO...

16:44.834 --> 16:46.667
I WAS THINKING SOME SORT
OF SOCIAL ACTIVITY

16:46.667 --> 16:48.083
WOULD BE A GOOD SEGUE.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.000
I DON'T KNOW.
WE COULD--

16:51.000 --> 16:52.792
HEY! LET ME HAVE ANOTHER
BEER FOR THE STAGE.

16:52.792 --> 16:54.125
NAH, I CAN'T LET YOU
TAKE THAT UP THERE.

16:54.125 --> 16:56.583
COME ON, YOU GUYS
BOTH WORK HERE,

16:56.583 --> 16:57.667
LIKE ANYONE CARES.

16:57.667 --> 16:58.834
WELL, I CARE ACTUALLY,

16:58.834 --> 17:00.291
AND IT SEEMS TO ME
YOU'RE ALREADY WASTED.

17:00.291 --> 17:01.625
WELL, WHO'S FAULT IS THAT?

17:01.625 --> 17:03.125
UH, YOURS.

17:04.165 --> 17:07.040
YEAH, WELL,
YOU SERVED ME, SUCKER.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.708
YEAH, NOW I'M
CUTTING YOU OFF.

17:08.708 --> 17:10.500
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO LISTEN
TO YOURSELF SING SOBER.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.541
SORRY.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.959
COME ON, EDDIE, I MEAN...

17:15.959 --> 17:17.000
IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE'S GOING OUT DRIVING.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.959
IT'S JUST--SHE'S NERVOUS.

17:18.959 --> 17:20.708
HAVEN'T YOU EVER
CONSIDERED OUR ASSES
MIGHT BE ON THE LINE

17:20.708 --> 17:22.000
FOR SERVING
UNDERAGE PEOPLE?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.416
OR DID THAT JUST
KINDA SLIP YOUR MIND

17:23.416 --> 17:24.416
'CAUSE YOU'RE
NOT WORKING TONIGHT?

17:24.416 --> 17:25.834
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:25.834 --> 17:27.375
THIS IS A COLLEGE BAR.

17:27.375 --> 17:30.208
I MEAN, YOU'VE
NEVER CARED BEFORE.

17:30.208 --> 17:32.208
YEAH, WELL, I CARE
WHEN AN UNDERAGE GIRL

17:32.208 --> 17:35.166
GETS DRUNK AND TRASHES
THE PLACE ON MY WATCH.

17:35.166 --> 17:36.542
I'M CUTTING HER OFF.
THAT'S IT.

17:36.542 --> 17:38.542
GAH, SOMEBODY
NEEDS TO GET LAID.

17:38.542 --> 17:39.834
AUDREY.
WHATEVER.

17:39.834 --> 17:42.500
HE CLEARLY
TAKES HIS JOB
TOO SERIOUSLY.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.083
TELL ME SOMETHING,
EDDIE.

17:44.083 --> 17:46.542
WHAT'S IT LIKE
LOOKING DOWN
THE BARREL OF A GUN

17:46.542 --> 17:49.041
AND SEEING
A JANITOR'S UNIFORM
AND A BUS PASS?

17:51.583 --> 17:53.375
YOU'LL GET ME ANOTHER BEER,
WON'T YOU, SWEETIE?

17:53.375 --> 17:54.750
I'M THINKING NO.

17:54.750 --> 17:56.375
JEEZ! IT'S LIKE
THIS BAR'S RUN

17:56.375 --> 17:59.375
BY DONNA REED
AND MR. ROGERS.

17:59.375 --> 18:00.875
ALL RIGHT,
GET HER OUT OF HERE.

18:00.875 --> 18:03.542
DID YOU NOT JUST WITNESS
MY MAGNIFICENT FORCE?

18:03.542 --> 18:05.625
YEAH, AUDREY,
DID YOU NOT HEAR US
WARMING UP UP THERE?

18:05.625 --> 18:06.583
THINK WE'RE DOING IT
FOR A LARK?

18:06.583 --> 18:08.125
GET UP THERE.

18:08.125 --> 18:10.375
Audrey: I LOVE YOU,
YOU CRAZY BIRD!

18:10.375 --> 18:12.750
Emma: HEY, SPREAD
THE JOY ON STAGE,
COURTNEY LOVE.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.291
OK? WE'RE ON.

18:14.291 --> 18:16.208
BAH!
GO, GO, GO.

18:18.708 --> 18:20.208
I'M NOT HER KEEPER.

18:20.208 --> 18:22.041
NO, IT'S WORSE ACTUALLY.
YOU'RE HER FRIEND.

18:26.959 --> 18:29.250
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

18:29.250 --> 18:31.250
HEY, HOW ARE WE ALL
DOIN' TONIGHT?

18:32.333 --> 18:34.542
WE'RE HELL'S BELLES,

18:34.542 --> 18:37.208
AND WE ARE HERE
TO THROW DOWN
THIS FASCIST REGIME.

18:37.208 --> 18:39.083
SEEMS LIKE
THE ESTABLISHMENT

18:39.083 --> 18:41.250
DON'T WANT US
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.959
WHO WANTS TO STICK IT
TO THE MAN?

21:13.708 --> 21:15.625
(VOMITING)

21:21.083 --> 21:23.542
(COUGHS)
OH. YEAH, OK.

21:23.542 --> 21:25.542
I THINK THAT'S EVERYTHING.

21:25.542 --> 21:28.917
I THINK THAT THERE IS
SOME INTESTINE IN THERE.

21:28.917 --> 21:31.041
OK. WHY DON'T WE GO
GET YOU SOME WATER?

21:35.959 --> 21:37.125
HOW MUCH
DID YOU DRINK?

21:37.125 --> 21:38.750
(WATER RUNS)

21:38.750 --> 21:40.750
(SIPS AND SPITS)

21:40.750 --> 21:42.291
CLEARLY,
I DON'T REMEMBER.

21:42.291 --> 21:44.500
WERE YOU DRINKING
IN THE CHANGING ROOM?

21:44.500 --> 21:46.500
BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE YOU
HAVE THAT MUCH AT THE BAR.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.291
I SAID
I DON'T REMEMBER.

21:48.291 --> 21:50.750
THIS--
AUDREY,

21:50.750 --> 21:52.291
NOT TO SOUND LIKE
AN AFTER SCHOOL SPECIAL,

21:52.291 --> 21:56.333
BUT THIS KIND OF
ISN'T LIKE YOU.

21:56.333 --> 21:58.959
AND WHAT EXACTLY
IS LIKE ME?

21:58.959 --> 22:02.125
YOU KNOW, I COULD'VE BEEN
AN ALKIE SINCE AGE 6.
YOU DON'T KNOW.

22:02.125 --> 22:03.125
IT'S JUST--

22:03.125 --> 22:04.417
I'M FINE!

22:04.417 --> 22:06.959
HAVE YOU NEVER
GOTTEN DRUNK BEFORE?

22:06.959 --> 22:08.750
YEAH, ACTUALLY, I HAVE,
AND IT'S USUALLY BEEN

22:08.750 --> 22:11.125
BECAUSE I FELT
PRETTY AWFUL
ABOUT SOMETHING, SO...

22:11.125 --> 22:13.792
LOOK, I WAS
JUST WONDERING
IF YOU FELT AWFUL.

22:13.792 --> 22:16.375
I FEEL LIKE I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE A SOULFUL EXCHANGE

22:16.375 --> 22:18.667
ABOUT HOW I'M BAD
AND YOU'RE GOOD,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.

22:18.667 --> 22:20.166
YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT
WHERE I WAS GOING.

22:20.166 --> 22:22.667
LIKE HELL IT WASN'T.
YOU KNOW,
YOU'VE MASTERED THE ART

22:22.667 --> 22:25.500
OF HOLIER THAN THOU, JOEY.
YOU KNOW, DON'T FEED ME
A BUNCH OF CRAP

22:25.500 --> 22:27.834
ABOUT HOW YOU DON'T NEED TO
DRINK OR DO DRUGS TO HAVE FUN

22:27.834 --> 22:30.041
BECAUSE I'VE GIVEN IT
SOME THOUGHT,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:30.041 --> 22:32.458
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
HAVE FUN A DAY IN MY LIFE.

22:32.458 --> 22:34.166
EXCEPT FOR THAT WHOLE
SINGING THING,

22:34.166 --> 22:36.125
AND EVEN THEN YOU
WERE JUST IMITATING ME.

22:36.125 --> 22:38.333
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST SAVE
THIS FOR THE MORNING

22:38.333 --> 22:39.834
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT
TO SAY ANYTHING
WE'LL REGRET.

22:39.834 --> 22:42.000
GOD! WILL YOU STOP
PROTECTING ME?!

22:42.000 --> 22:44.792
I'M SO SICK OF LIVING
IN THIS LITTLE ANTISEPTIC
UNIVERSE

22:44.792 --> 22:46.250
YOU'VE ALL CREATED.

22:46.250 --> 22:49.041
ALL WE DO IS WE SIT AROUND
AND WE DRINK SODA AND WE TALK

22:49.041 --> 22:50.792
ABOUT HOW GLAD WE ARE
THAT WE'RE ALL FRIENDS,

22:50.792 --> 22:52.667
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS, JOEY,

22:52.667 --> 22:55.125
BECAUSE WHAT KIND OF FRIEND
WOULDN'T KNOW THAT I BROKE UP
WITH MY BOYFRIEND?

22:55.125 --> 22:58.250
YOU KNOW WHAT, AUDREY?
I SAID I WAS SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

22:58.250 --> 23:02.166
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T EVEN CARE.

23:02.166 --> 23:07.708
I JUST DON'T WANT SOMEONE
WHO'S COMPLETELY DROPPED OUT
OF MY LIFE SUDDENLY JUDGING IT.

23:07.708 --> 23:09.333
I MEAN, DID YOU EVEN NOTICE
THAT I WAS DEPRESSED

23:09.333 --> 23:11.875
BEFORE I UPSET YOUR LITTLE
BOYFRIEND FROM SOUTHIE?

23:11.875 --> 23:13.041
EDDIE IS NOT
MY BOYFRIEND.

23:13.041 --> 23:15.083
RIGHT.

23:15.083 --> 23:17.542
I THINK IT'S REALLY
FRIGGING PATHETIC

23:17.542 --> 23:19.959
THAT THAT'S THE ONLY THING
YOU HAD THE NEED TO COMMENT ON.

23:26.041 --> 23:27.917
SO HAVE FUN TONIGHT,
WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING.

23:27.917 --> 23:30.708
TO BE HONEST, I DON'T KNOW
IF THERE'S SOMEWHERE
LEFT TO GO.

23:30.708 --> 23:33.500
I DIDN'T MEAN TO KEEP YOU
IN THERE WITH MY BORING
SCHOLASTIC JABBER.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.208
NO. NO, I WASN'T BORED.

23:35.208 --> 23:36.834
IT'S WHY I'M BRAVING
SOCIAL LEPROSY.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.834
I'M GLAD YOU CAME.

23:40.834 --> 23:44.417
THERE'S A PART OF MY BOOK
THAT I WROTE AFTER CLASS
EARLY IN THE SEMESTER,

23:44.417 --> 23:48.041
YOU'D MADE A COMMENT IN CLASS
ABOUT THE ASEXUALITY
OF GOOD GUYS IN FILM.

23:48.041 --> 23:51.208
IT WAS A SMALL THING I REMEMBER,
BUT IT SPARKED SOMETHING,

23:51.208 --> 23:54.917
AND I THOUGHT NO ONE
DOES THAT ANYMORE.
SPARKS SOMETHING.

23:54.917 --> 23:57.750
YOU WERE RIGHT.
NOT JUST IN CLASS.

23:57.750 --> 23:59.750
YOU WERE JUST...

23:59.750 --> 24:00.583
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT
A LOT OF THINGS.

24:02.458 --> 24:04.458
I WASN'T WAITING FOR YOU
TO TELL ME THAT,

24:04.458 --> 24:06.458
IF THAT'S WHY YOU THINK
I'M STANDING OUT HERE
IN THE COLD.

24:06.458 --> 24:07.583
THEN WHY ARE YOU?

24:11.250 --> 24:16.917
IT'S SAD...THAT YOU'RE
PROBABLY THE MOST
POPULAR PROFESSOR HERE,

24:16.917 --> 24:19.125
THE MOST INSPIRATIONAL,

24:19.125 --> 24:22.750
AND YET YOU FELT YOU HAD
TO HIDE THAT PART
OF YOURSELF THAT'S REAL.

24:22.750 --> 24:25.291
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:25.291 --> 24:30.875
HOWEVER LONG IT TOOK
FOR YOU TO GET HERE,
AT LEAST YOU DID IT.

24:32.333 --> 24:34.458
AND THAT'S WHY
I'M STANDING OUT HERE
IN THE COLD.

24:36.792 --> 24:39.417
A WEEK AGO I WAS THIS
UNAVAILABLE MARRIED MAN.

24:39.417 --> 24:43.125
THERE USED TO BE ABOUT
6 DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF MYSELF
I PRESENTED TO THE WORLD.

24:43.125 --> 24:46.083
NOW THERE'S JUST...THIS.

24:48.333 --> 24:50.250
AND NOW I KIND OF WISH
I'D NOTICED IT SOONER.

24:51.959 --> 24:53.417
OR THAT I'D NOTICED YOU.

25:04.208 --> 25:05.375
MAYBE IT'S TOO LATE.

25:07.041 --> 25:08.583
YOU TELL ME.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.333
I CAN'T.

25:19.333 --> 25:23.000
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.041
I'VE KEPT SOMEONE
WAITING ALL NIGHT

25:25.041 --> 25:26.792
THAT THE TIMING WAS
ACTUALLY RIGHT WITH.

25:29.667 --> 25:30.583
IT'S LATE.

25:34.208 --> 25:35.458
I GOTTA GO.

25:37.208 --> 25:39.458
YEAH, I GOTTA GO.

25:44.583 --> 25:46.875
GUESS YOU WEREN'T SO OFF BASE
WITH THE WHOLE AUDREY THING.

25:46.875 --> 25:49.917
YOU MEAN HER PERFORMANCES
AREN'T TYPICALLY
THAT INSPIRED?

25:49.917 --> 25:55.125
UH, NOT SO JENNIFER JASON LEIGH
IN GEORGIA,  NO.

25:55.125 --> 25:57.083
THANK YOU.

25:58.708 --> 26:01.542
AUDREY'S ONE OF THE FEW
PEOPLE THAT I KNOW

26:01.542 --> 26:07.250
WHO SEEMED TO ENTER THE FOLD
WELL ADJUSTED AND CONFIDENT.

26:07.250 --> 26:09.667
SHE MADE ALL OF US
SEEM DRAMATIC.

26:09.667 --> 26:10.667
IT'S HARD TO KEEP
PUTTING UP A FRONT
LIKE THAT,

26:10.667 --> 26:11.875
ONCE PEOPLE
EXPECT IT FROM YOU.

26:11.875 --> 26:13.875
YOU KNOW, YOU WAKE UP
IN THE MORNING,

26:13.875 --> 26:15.083
YOU DON'T FEEL SO GREAT,

26:15.083 --> 26:17.250
SO YOU NEED SOMETHING
TO TAKE OFF THE EDGE.

26:17.250 --> 26:19.000
THAT'S WHAT I USED TO DO.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.083
I TOOK MY FIRST DRINK
WHEN I WAS 12.

26:22.083 --> 26:26.291
WHEN I HIT HIGH SCHOOL,
I WAS SHAKING BY NOON
IF I WASN'T DRUNK.

26:26.291 --> 26:28.917
SO RATHER THAN THINKING
LIKE, "HEY,
THAT CAN'T BE NORMAL"

26:28.917 --> 26:30.750
I JUST KEPT DRINKING.

26:30.750 --> 26:35.917
PROVIDED A STEADY
NUMB RIDE THROUGH THOSE
AWKWARD TEEN YEARS.

26:35.917 --> 26:37.583
IT'S TOUGH
TO GET OFF OF.

26:37.583 --> 26:40.625
YEAH. YEAH, BUT YOU DID.

26:41.708 --> 26:43.458
SO YOU MUST'VE DONE
SOMETHING RIGHT.

26:43.458 --> 26:45.708
YEAH. YEAH.
I HIT ROCK BOTTOM.

26:45.708 --> 26:48.291
SURE FIRE WAY TO
SNAP OUT OF SOMETHING

26:48.291 --> 26:51.083
IS TO WAKE UP
FROM A BLACKOUT

26:51.083 --> 26:52.625
REALIZING
THAT YOU WERE THE GUY
AT THE PARTY

26:52.625 --> 26:54.750
WHO TOLD EVERYBODY
EXACTLY WHAT THEY
DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR

26:54.750 --> 26:59.708
AND THEN ALIENATING
THE ONE PERSON
THAT YOU CARED ABOUT.

27:02.750 --> 27:06.542
SO, THERE'S THAT,
WHICH IS WHY I
DON'T DATE ANYMORE.

27:09.458 --> 27:12.792
I REALLY--I DON'T THINK
YOU HAVE TO BE SO HARD
ON YOURSELF.

27:12.792 --> 27:15.083
I--WE ALL MESS UP.

27:15.083 --> 27:18.333
JEN, YOU REALLY DON'T
WANT TO KNOW THAT MUCH
ABOUT ME, I PROMISE.

27:26.834 --> 27:29.166
UH, PROBABLY GONNA NEED
A KEY FOR THIS.

27:29.166 --> 27:30.500
THAT MIGHT HELP.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.458
WHERE WOULD YOU
HAVE PUT THAT?

27:32.458 --> 27:33.708
UH, HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

27:34.792 --> 27:36.500
I'M NOT SO GOOD
AT WAITING.

27:41.625 --> 27:42.542
HERE WE GO.

27:43.625 --> 27:44.542
OK.

28:06.333 --> 28:07.500
SOME NIGHT, HUH?

28:07.500 --> 28:08.458
YEP.

28:11.333 --> 28:13.667
I'M SORRY ABOUT...

28:15.000 --> 28:17.959
SORRY ABOUT
THE WHOLE DRINKING,
SINGING DEBACLE.

28:17.959 --> 28:19.500
I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS GONNA GO THAT WAY.

28:19.500 --> 28:20.959
IT WASN'T YOUR PROBLEM,
RIGHT?

28:20.959 --> 28:22.542
YOU WEREN'T WORKING,
SO WHY SHOULD IT MATTER

28:22.542 --> 28:24.542
THAT YOUR FRIENDS WERE
GONNA TRASH THE PLACE?

28:24.542 --> 28:26.875
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY
INTENDED TO DO THAT.

28:26.875 --> 28:28.834
THAT'S NOT REALLY
THE POINT, JOEY.

28:28.834 --> 28:30.834
WELL, CARE TO FILL ME IN
ON WHAT THE POINT IS?

28:30.834 --> 28:32.875
WHY SHOULD I MAKE YOU
STAND HERE AND LISTEN
TO MY DIATRIBE

28:32.875 --> 28:35.333
WHEN YOU CLEARLY HAVE
BETTER THINGS TO DO?
EXCUSE ME.

28:35.333 --> 28:37.708
WHY ARE YOU SO INSISTENT
TONIGHT THAT I'M WASTING
MY TIME WITH YOU

28:37.708 --> 28:39.708
WHEN EVERY TIME
I APPROACH YOU,

28:39.708 --> 28:41.041
IT'S BEEN BECAUSE
I WANTED TO TALK?

28:41.041 --> 28:42.708
MAYBE I'VE HAD A HARD TIME
TALKING TO YOU

28:42.708 --> 28:44.250
BECAUSE I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHO I'M TALKING TO.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.375
IS THIS JOEY POTTER
MY BARTENDING BUDDY,

28:46.375 --> 28:48.834
OR IS THIS JOEY POTTER WHO RUNS
WITH THE WORTHINGTON ELITE?

28:50.208 --> 28:51.875
THAT'S FUNNY.

28:51.875 --> 28:53.708
I THOUGHT THERE WAS MORE OF
AN INTIMATE MIDDLE GROUND.

28:53.708 --> 28:55.708
LOOK, YOU JUST LEARN
A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE

28:55.708 --> 28:57.875
WHEN YOU SEE THEM
WITH THEIR FRIENDS, OK?

28:57.875 --> 28:59.917
YOU SEE ME WITH MY FRIENDS
IN HERE ALL THE TIME.

28:59.917 --> 29:01.208
HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT?

29:01.208 --> 29:02.375
IT'S DIFFERENT
WHEN YOUR FRIENDS

29:02.375 --> 29:03.542
ARE FLAUNTING
STATE DRINKING LAWS

29:03.542 --> 29:04.875
AND INSULTING ME
TO MY FACE.

29:04.875 --> 29:06.208
LOOK, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT, OK?

29:06.208 --> 29:07.875
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER,

29:07.875 --> 29:10.208
I JUST GOT A PRETTY
NASTY TONGUE LASHING
FROM AUDREY IN THERE.

29:10.208 --> 29:12.041
WHAT WOULD'VE MADE ME
FEEL BETTER IS IF YOU
WOULD'VE DEFENDED ME.

29:12.041 --> 29:15.208
IF YOU HAD MENTALLY
SHOWN UP THERE, JOEY,
THAT MIGHT'VE BEEN NICE.

29:15.208 --> 29:17.208
EDDIE, SHE WAS DRUNK.

29:17.208 --> 29:19.542
WE DEAL
WITH THOSE PEOPLE
ALL OF THE TIME.

29:19.542 --> 29:21.583
YOU'RE RIGHT, JOEY.
WHY SHOULD I MAKE YOU FEEL BAD

29:21.583 --> 29:23.708
FOR LETTING YOUR FRIEND RIDE OUT
HER HIGH-CLASS PROBLEMS?

29:23.708 --> 29:26.083
I SHOULD BE USED TO IT
BY NOW, RIGHT?

29:26.083 --> 29:28.375
MY MISTAKE WAS JUST
THINKING YOU WERE DIFFERENT
FROM THE REST OF THEM.

29:28.375 --> 29:31.542
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT
WHEN YOU'VE BARELY EVEN
TRIED TO FIND OUT?

29:31.542 --> 29:33.041
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE
YOU'RE JUST THREATENED

29:33.041 --> 29:35.083
BECAUSE I TRIED TO
FIND OUT MORE ABOUT YOU,

29:35.083 --> 29:36.291
BUT THAT'S JUST
BECAUSE I WAS TRYING
TO HELP YOU--

29:36.291 --> 29:38.750
I KNOW WHAT YOU WERE
TRYING TO DO, JOEY,

29:38.750 --> 29:40.458
AND I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BOTHER.

29:40.458 --> 29:43.583
I DON'T THINK EITHER OF US
SHOULD BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT,

29:43.583 --> 29:49.083
AND THIS LITTLE DANCE WE DO,
IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN THAT.
IT'S JUST FLIRTING.

29:51.917 --> 29:53.750
YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING MORE HERE?

29:53.750 --> 29:56.417
I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING GOOD.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.291
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

30:20.291 --> 30:21.917
ABSOLUTELY.

30:21.917 --> 30:24.458
THIS ISN'T YOUR FIRST TIME,
IS IT?

30:25.917 --> 30:27.500
AM I REALLY THAT BAD?

30:27.500 --> 30:32.500
NO. JUST MOST GUYS
DON'T BOTHER WITH
THE OBLIGATORY FOREPLAY.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.542
WHICH IS GREATLY
APPRECIATED AND ALL,

30:34.542 --> 30:37.041
BUT I'M KIND OF
A SURE THING.

30:40.166 --> 30:44.333
OK, WELL, I'LL DO
MY BEST TO NOT TEND
TO ANY OF YOUR NEEDS,

30:44.333 --> 30:46.834
BUT I CAN'T PROMISE
ANYTHING.

30:52.500 --> 30:55.959
SERIOUSLY, WE'VE BEEN
AT THIS FOR A WHILE NOW,

30:55.959 --> 30:57.625
AND YOUR FRIEND
DIDN'T PAY FOR THE NIGHT.

31:01.208 --> 31:03.083
MM...

31:03.083 --> 31:06.000
LISTEN IT WAS
A NICE THING HE WAS DOING.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.500
YOU SHOULD JUST ENJOY IT.

31:10.458 --> 31:12.417
BUT I REALLY...

31:12.417 --> 31:13.708
I CAN'T.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.125
I CAN'T. I'M SORRY.

31:18.750 --> 31:20.834
I DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE.

31:20.834 --> 31:23.375
NO. YOU ABSOLUTELY
DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE.

31:23.375 --> 31:24.875
YOU CAN STAY HERE
AS LONG AS YOU LIKE,

31:24.875 --> 31:27.625
BUT...I--I JUST...

31:27.625 --> 31:30.208
I CAN'T DO THIS.

31:30.208 --> 31:32.875
I JUST THOUGHT YOU
WERE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
THAT I MET DOWN IN THE BAR.

31:32.875 --> 31:35.417
AND THAT THERE WAS
A LITTLE...

31:35.417 --> 31:37.708
SOMETHING BETWEEN US,
BUT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT.
AND THAT'S FINE.

31:37.708 --> 31:42.000
BUT I NOW HAVE TO GO
TO TALK TO SOMEONE,
SO YOU STAY HERE AND...

31:42.000 --> 31:43.333
I'M REALLY SORRY.

31:52.417 --> 31:54.417
SO YOU'RE SURE DAVID'S
GONNA BE OK IN THERE
ALL BY HIMSELF?

31:54.417 --> 31:55.792
OH, YEAH. YEAH.
HE SAID HE'D HANG AROUND
FOR ANOTHER HALF HOUR,

31:55.792 --> 31:57.208
THEN CALL IT A NIGHT.

31:57.208 --> 31:59.417
GOD, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
JACK'S PROBLEM IS,

31:59.417 --> 32:01.083
BUT I'M GONNA KICK HIS ASS.

32:01.083 --> 32:04.542
WELL, LUCKILY DAVID'S
A VERY PATIENT MAN.

32:04.542 --> 32:07.917
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST REALLY GLAD
YOU CAME OUT TONIGHT.

32:07.917 --> 32:10.417
I WAS WORRIED YOU
WOULDN'T WANT TO.

32:10.417 --> 32:12.125
YOU KNOW, YOU KEEP
SAYING THAT.

32:12.125 --> 32:13.834
JUST 'CAUSE I DON'T
DRINK DOESN'T MEAN
I DON'T SOCIALIZE.

32:15.291 --> 32:17.083
BUT YOU DON'T DATE.

32:17.083 --> 32:18.750
NO.

32:18.750 --> 32:22.917
YOU TOLD ME ONCE THAT I SHOULD
CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT MYSELF,

32:22.917 --> 32:26.208
AND I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY DO THE SAME THING.

32:37.250 --> 32:38.250
JEN.

32:39.375 --> 32:40.750
I CAN'T.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.583
I'M SORRY, IT'S...

32:44.583 --> 32:46.583
IT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU,
I PROMISE.

32:46.583 --> 32:50.125
YOU'RE...
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL,
AND YOU'RE GREAT.

32:50.125 --> 32:52.333
I JUST REALLY CAN'T.

32:53.417 --> 32:54.333
OK.

32:57.959 --> 32:59.542
I'M GONNA GET YOU
A CAB HOME, OK?

32:59.542 --> 33:00.708
OK.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.458
YOU GONNA BE OK?

33:12.458 --> 33:14.667
YEAH. I'M FINE.

33:14.667 --> 33:16.917
NOTHING A LITTLE SLEEP
AND REGRET WON'T CURE.

33:19.333 --> 33:20.375
GOOD NIGHT.

33:20.375 --> 33:21.291
GOOD NIGHT.

33:38.542 --> 33:41.500
I ONLY HAD A COUPLE
OF PUFFS, I SWEAR.

33:41.500 --> 33:42.667
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU SMOKE.

33:42.667 --> 33:44.917
WELL, THAT'S SHOCKING.

33:44.917 --> 33:48.500
BECAUSE I THOUGHT FOR
SURE THERE WAS SOME SORT
OF LO-JACK SYSTEM ON ME,

33:48.500 --> 33:50.875
AND ANYONE
WITHIN A MILE RADIUS
WAS GONNA CHASTISE ME

33:50.875 --> 33:53.041
FOR PARTAKING IN
ANY SORT OF SUBSTANCE.

33:53.041 --> 33:54.875
YOU KNOW, I WONDER
IF SUGAR'S OK

33:54.875 --> 33:56.917
BECAUSE I HAVE
SOME SWEET TARTS
IN MY POCKET,

33:56.917 --> 33:59.500
AND I'M NOT AFRAID
TO EAT THEM.

33:59.500 --> 34:02.166
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
PRETTY HARD ON YOU TONIGHT,
HAVEN'T THEY?

34:02.166 --> 34:06.041
YOU KNOW THE FUNNY THING
IS THAT IT WAS ALL GREAT
WHEN I WAS DRUNK.

34:06.041 --> 34:08.041
THAT WAS
A SUPER OLD TIME.

34:08.041 --> 34:11.542
NOW I'M SOBER,
AND EVERYTHING'S
GONE TO HELL.

34:14.041 --> 34:16.041
YOU KNOW, YOUR FRIENDS
WERE JUST TRYING TO
LET YOU KNOW THEY CARED.

34:16.041 --> 34:18.333
MAYBE THEY DIDN'T GO
ABOUT IT THE RIGHT WAY.

34:21.208 --> 34:23.833
IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M A DRUNK, YOU KNOW.

34:23.833 --> 34:27.000
GOD, WE'RE IN COLLEGE,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.875
DOESN'T ANYONE JUST EVER
HAVE A WEEK THAT SUCKS,

34:28.875 --> 34:31.041
AND THEY WANT TO
FORGET ABOUT IT?

34:31.041 --> 34:32.375
DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER...

34:32.375 --> 34:35.417
WHEN YOU...DRINK?

34:38.041 --> 34:40.166
I FEEL NOTHING,
WHICH IS IDEAL.

34:40.166 --> 34:41.583
HOW LONG YOU GONNA
KEEP THAT UP FOR?

34:41.583 --> 34:42.958
I DON'T KNOW.

34:44.542 --> 34:46.375
I DON'T KNOW.

34:54.875 --> 34:56.375
IF YOU WANNA TALK OR...

34:56.375 --> 34:59.667
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIT
WITH ME, REALLY.

34:59.667 --> 35:01.583
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT.

35:03.542 --> 35:05.000
IF I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE,
I'D HAVE WALKED AWAY ALREADY.

35:12.083 --> 35:13.750
OK.

35:13.750 --> 35:15.667
SO WE'LL SIT.

35:19.083 --> 35:20.875
I DON'T WANNA TALK
FOR A WHILE.

35:47.834 --> 35:49.625
YOU OWE ME 20 BUCKS,
RINALDI.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.417
Pacey: RICH!

35:51.417 --> 35:53.625
HEY, RINALDI!
COME HERE.

35:53.625 --> 35:56.125
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, WITTER?

35:56.125 --> 35:58.667
MY PROBLEM IS THE
LITTLE TRICK YOU JUST
TRIED TO PLAY ON ME.

35:58.667 --> 36:01.917
YOU'RE NOT MORALLY OPPOSED
TO LADIES OF THE NIGHT,
ARE YOU?

36:01.917 --> 36:04.500
DUDE, WITTER STUFFED A WHORE!

36:04.500 --> 36:07.291
ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T,
KATZ, BUT YOU KEEP
TALKING.

36:07.291 --> 36:09.000
YOU WATCH
HOW QUICKLY
YOUR NIGHT ENDS.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.333
YOU DIDN'T EVEN DO IT?

36:10.333 --> 36:12.208
WHAT, YOU GOT A PROBLEM
DOWN THERE, WITTER,

36:12.208 --> 36:13.959
OR JUST HAVE TROUBLE TAKING
OFF YOUR LITTLE DRESS?

36:13.959 --> 36:17.291
IS THIS A JOKE TO YOU?
'CAUSE LET ME TELL YOU,
I'M NOT LAUGHING.

36:17.291 --> 36:19.500
TELL ME ABOUT IT. NO.
IT WAS MY IDEA OF
SHOWING YOU A GOOD TIME.

36:19.500 --> 36:21.708
BELIEVE ME.
SHE DIDN'T COME CHEAP.

36:21.708 --> 36:25.041
I FORGOT THAT ABOUT YOU.
IT ALL RELATES BACK
TO MONEY.

36:25.041 --> 36:26.708
YOU BUY YOUR FRIENDS,
YOU BUY YOUR WOMEN,

36:26.708 --> 36:28.875
YOU BUY WOMEN FOR
YOUR FRIENDS. THAT WAY
IT'S CLEAN, IT'S EASY.

36:28.875 --> 36:30.875
NO EMOTION, RIGHT? WELL,
LET ME TELL YOU, RICH.

36:30.875 --> 36:33.166
THE ONLY FAVOR
I WANT YOU TO DO FOR ME

36:33.166 --> 36:34.875
IS TAKE ME OFF
YOUR CHARITY LIST.

36:34.875 --> 36:36.125
'CAUSE YOU'RE PATHETIC,
MAN.

36:36.125 --> 36:38.125
HONESTLY, MAN,
I'M NOT GETTING IT.

36:38.125 --> 36:40.875
A COUPLE OF SOLID HOURS
WITH A REALLY HOT GIRL YOU
NEVER HAVE TO CALL AGAIN,

36:40.875 --> 36:42.542
AND WHAT,
YOU PLAY TIDDLY WINKS?

36:42.542 --> 36:46.208
I MUST BE REAL DUMB
BECAUSE IT SEEMS
LIKE YOU OWE ME.

36:48.166 --> 36:49.959
YOU'RE RIGHT. I DO.
I ABSOLUTELY--

36:49.959 --> 36:51.208
(OVERLAPPING SHOUTS)

36:51.208 --> 36:52.708
HOW DARE YOU
DO THAT TO ME?!

36:52.708 --> 36:54.917
I'M PISSED!
I'M REALLY PISSED AT
YOUR MORAL OUTRAGE.

36:54.917 --> 36:56.417
NO NEED TO GET VIOLENT.

36:58.375 --> 37:00.500
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA REALIZE
FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT'S
NOT WORTH IT?

37:11.041 --> 37:13.041
HEY, DAVID.

37:13.041 --> 37:15.875
DAVID, I AM SO SORRY.

37:15.875 --> 37:18.458
I--I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE STILL HERE.

37:18.458 --> 37:20.041
WHAT, YOU WERE
HOPING I'D BE GONE?

37:20.041 --> 37:23.041
NO! NO. NO. OF COURSE NOT.
I'M GLAD YOU STAYED.

37:23.041 --> 37:25.250
I JUST KEPT MISSING
MY WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY
TO GET OUT OF THERE.

37:25.250 --> 37:26.542
THAT MUST'VE BEEN ROUGH.

37:26.542 --> 37:27.875
YEAH.

37:30.667 --> 37:32.375
I'M NOT BEING
TOO CONVINCING, AM I?

37:32.375 --> 37:36.291
LOOK, JACK, I'M NOT SO NAIVE
COMING INTO THIS

37:36.291 --> 37:38.041
THAT I DIDN'T EXPECT THERE
TO BE SOME BAGGAGE.

37:38.041 --> 37:41.333
YOU CAN'T REALLY MOVE
INTO A NEW RELATIONSHIP

37:41.333 --> 37:45.083
UNTIL YOU KNOW THE OLD ONE
ISN'T GONNA LURCH UP
FROM THE DEAD ONE LAST TIME.

37:45.083 --> 37:47.708
SO, DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

37:47.708 --> 37:50.708
I DID. I MEAN, I DIDN'T.
I...

37:50.708 --> 37:52.250
I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

37:52.250 --> 37:54.417
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO REPORT TO ME.

37:54.417 --> 37:57.417
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THE BAGGAGE.

37:57.417 --> 37:59.083
IT'S JUST NOT...

37:59.083 --> 38:00.917
BEFORE WE GOT
INTO THIS, I JUST
WANTED TO MAKE SURE

38:00.917 --> 38:03.083
THAT I WAS DONE
REPEATING MY MISTAKES.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.208
AND I AM.

38:06.583 --> 38:07.583
THAT WORKS FOR ME.

38:07.583 --> 38:08.750
COOL.

38:08.750 --> 38:09.959
YEAH.

38:09.959 --> 38:11.583
COOL.

38:11.583 --> 38:14.792
SO WHY DID YOU
EVEN BOTHER STICKING
AROUND HERE?

38:14.792 --> 38:17.333
HEY, DON'T THINK I WAS WAITING
FOR THE CONFUSED LIKES OF YOU.

38:17.333 --> 38:18.625
(CHUCKLES)

38:18.625 --> 38:20.125
I WAS HAVING
A GOOD TIME,

38:20.125 --> 38:21.792
AND YOU MISSED
A HELL OF AN ACT.

38:21.792 --> 38:23.458
HUH. DID I?

38:23.458 --> 38:25.625
YES. IT WAS
ONE MAGICAL NIGHT
YOU'LL NEVER GET BACK.

38:25.625 --> 38:27.917
SO THIS ONE'S GONNA
BE TOUGH TO TOP.

38:27.917 --> 38:29.917
THAT'S AWFULLY
PRESUMPTUOUS TO ASSUME
WE'RE GOING OUT AGAIN.

38:29.917 --> 38:33.208
OH, HA! I SEE HOW IT IS.
I SEE HOW IT IS.

39:24.333 --> 39:26.125
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

39:35.166 --> 39:38.000
WOW! SO THIS IS HOW
THE OTHER HALF LIVES.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

39:40.041 --> 39:44.208
UH, YOUR LITTLE FRIEND
LEFT HER WALLET
AT THE BAR LAST NIGHT.

39:44.208 --> 39:45.708
CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW SHE FORGOT IT,

39:45.708 --> 39:48.750
WITH THE DRUNKEN
SPECTACLE AND
THE VOMITING AND ALL.

39:48.750 --> 39:50.041
THANKS.

39:50.041 --> 39:51.000
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT, JOEY.

39:54.917 --> 39:58.917
LAST NIGHT I SAID A LOT
OF THINGS I DIDN'T MEAN.

39:58.917 --> 40:01.000
YEAH, WHAT THINGS?

40:01.000 --> 40:02.708
MANY THINGS.

40:06.250 --> 40:10.041
IT COULD BE THAT I HAVE
SOME UNRESOLVED ANGER
TOWARDS SOCIETY

40:10.041 --> 40:13.000
THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.959
THAT'S GOOD.

40:16.250 --> 40:18.542
YEAH, I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON THAT ONE A WHILE.

40:18.542 --> 40:21.250
IT ALMOST RESEMBLED AN APOLOGY.

40:21.250 --> 40:26.375
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT ALL NIGHT.

40:26.375 --> 40:27.750
WHAT'S IT?

40:27.750 --> 40:28.417
THIS.

40:28.417 --> 40:29.834
ME, YOU.

40:31.125 --> 40:32.750
IT DIDN'T FEEL GOOD.

40:36.083 --> 40:39.166
WHAT PART?

40:39.166 --> 40:41.583
THE NOT PURSUING IT PART.

40:50.083 --> 40:51.834
YOU KNOW, UH...

40:54.291 --> 41:00.083
THE PUSHING AWAY USUALLY
COMES WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING
TO PUSH AWAY FROM.

41:00.083 --> 41:03.959
PLEASE, JOEY, I WOULD
LOVE TO GET TO THE POINT
WHERE I CAN RESENT YOU,

41:03.959 --> 41:06.250
IF YOU'LL ONLY
GIVE ME THE CHANCE.

41:08.750 --> 41:10.959
WE CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS.

41:10.959 --> 41:12.125
WHAT?

41:12.125 --> 41:15.792
THIS. THIS...SAYING THINGS
WE DON'T MEAN.

41:15.792 --> 41:18.792
DANCING AROUND THE SUBJECT.
I MEAN, DON'T YOU FIND IT
MADDENING?

41:18.792 --> 41:20.917
WELL, YEAH,
BUT I MEANT THAT THING
ABOUT THE RESENTMENT.

41:26.917 --> 41:30.417
OK. ALL RIGHT, I GET
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

41:32.750 --> 41:36.917
SO, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
IF YOU SAID WHAT YOU MEANT?

41:42.291 --> 41:43.959
I'D LIKE TO GO
ON A DATE WITH YOU.

41:43.959 --> 41:46.792
AN ACTUAL DATE.

41:46.792 --> 41:51.458
WITHOUT THE OBSTACLES
OF PRE-TEEN GIRLS
AND DRUNKEN ROOMMATES.

41:54.125 --> 41:55.291
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

41:58.959 --> 42:02.500
WELL, I'D LIKE TO GET
TO KNOW YOU AND PROVE
MYSELF WRONG.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.166
ABOUT?

42:07.166 --> 42:09.583
THINKING YOU REPRESENT
EVERYTHING I HATE.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.625
I THINK YOU JUST MIGHT
REPRESENT EVERYTHING
I'M MISSING.

42:20.959 --> 42:25.333
HOO, OK, SO...
IT'S A DATE.

42:36.208 --> 42:37.834
SEE YOU LATER, JOEY.
