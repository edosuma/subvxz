E. R.

00:04.575 --> 00:06.014
Previously on E. R.

00:06.015 --> 00:07.289
How long have you been sober?

00:07.390 --> 00:08.679
Almost five years.

00:08.780 --> 00:11.634
Your mother's not coming.
John, I'm gettind divorced.

00:11.635 --> 00:12.766
Stop!

00:12.896 --> 00:15.526
- You're hurting me. Stop.
- Check the stylet.

00:15.561 --> 00:17.848
We believe he may have schyzofrenia.

00:17.949 --> 00:20.501
Paul wouldn't hurt anyone. He couldn't.

00:25.956 --> 00:28.151
- I'm not deformed!
- Temperature's 95-

00:30.008 --> 00:31.072
Get off of me!

00:31.173 --> 00:32.882
- Get pregnant!
- I was pregnant!

00:33.570 --> 00:35.355
I had an abortion.

00:35.356 --> 00:37.672
You never even told Richard, did you?

00:39.941 --> 00:42.642
E. R. "BEYOND REPAIR"

00:42.857 --> 00:46.352
- You were supposed to wake me up!
- I'm not your damn mother, Brian!

00:46.523 --> 00:47.850
Why is it so cold in here?

00:48.022 --> 00:50.096
I called the super twice!
What have you done?

00:50.272 --> 00:53.435
I'm studying so I can get a job
that pays enough for us to move out!

00:53.605 --> 00:57.052
You don't even realize how you
talk to me sometimes! It's disgusting!

00:57.229 --> 00:59.551
You don't know when to stop!
You just keep pushing!

00:59.728 --> 01:02.761
I have a life too!
It's not waiting on you hand and foot!

01:02.936 --> 01:05.602
- You know what your problem is?
- We should work as a team.

01:05.768 --> 01:09.927
We don't because you don't treat me
as an equal. You treat me like crap!

01:10.101 --> 01:13.761
How do you think it makes me feel?
You're constantly belittling me-

01:13.933 --> 01:17.298
Give me at least five minutes
in the morning before you act like a bitch.

01:17.474 --> 01:19.263
- Shut up!
- Both of you shut up.

01:19.432 --> 01:22.264
You know what your problem is, Brian?
You don't need me!

01:22.431 --> 01:24.919
- You don't even like me.
- Keep it up!

01:25.097 --> 01:27.715
I just cook and clean
and pick up your dirty laundry.

01:27.888 --> 01:32.130
- But guess what, that's not why I'm here.
- Hi, this is Abby. Leave a message.

01:32.304 --> 01:36.167
Hello, Abby? Abby, are you there?
Hello? Abby?

01:36.345 --> 01:38.465
I thought I'd catch you before your shift.

01:38.636 --> 01:41.669
Anyway, I wanted to wish you
a happy birthday.

01:42.093 --> 01:43.586
Hi, Mom.

01:43.760 --> 01:45.797
No, I was just getting up.

01:45.968 --> 01:47.626
Thank you.

02:00.006 --> 02:02.245
Your feet are like ice.

02:02.422 --> 02:04.377
I'm sorry.

02:05.088 --> 02:07.541
- I put on some coffee.
- What time is it?

02:07.713 --> 02:09.667
It's about 7:30.

02:09.836 --> 02:13.415
- You sleep okay?
- Yeah. You?

02:13.795 --> 02:15.785
Except for the snoring.

02:16.586 --> 02:20.827
- I don't snore.
- Yeah, right. Like a truck driver.

02:21.001 --> 02:23.406
I don't snore.

02:25.084 --> 02:26.908
Stop it.

02:29.999 --> 02:31.871
Oh, no.

02:32.415 --> 02:35.033
Oh, yeah? Oh, wait a minute.

02:37.331 --> 02:40.079
I've arranged for a nurse's aide
for you while I'm at work.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.237
- A nurse?
- Just for a couple weeks.

02:42.413 --> 02:45.197
I've got half a dozen people
in this house every day.

02:45.371 --> 02:47.941
Well, then one more isn't gonna hurt.

02:48.120 --> 02:52.409
If it gets any colder
I'm going to winter in the Bahamas, alone.

02:52.577 --> 02:54.733
I thought I heard someone.

02:54.910 --> 02:57.576
Is it just me or is it freezing in here?

02:57.743 --> 02:59.070
Mom, what are you doing here?

02:59.242 --> 03:02.156
I assumed you could use a hand
while your grandmother recovered.

03:02.325 --> 03:04.362
How are you feeling, Millicent?

03:04.533 --> 03:06.440
I've been better.

03:06.616 --> 03:09.779
- Where's Jack?
- Kansas City, I think.

03:09.948 --> 03:13.029
- You don't know?
- He's on an extended business trip.

03:13.989 --> 03:16.477
We missed the pleasure
of your company at Christmas.

03:16.655 --> 03:19.321
- You know how the holidays can be.
- Where are you staying?

03:19.488 --> 03:21.395
- I was hoping to stay here.
- In the house?

03:21.571 --> 03:23.940
- Yes, if that's all right.
- Yeah.

03:24.112 --> 03:28.400
It is freezing in here. Would somebody
please turn up the furnace?

03:28.569 --> 03:30.275
I will go get Alger on it.

03:30.652 --> 03:32.228
- It won't start.
- Did you flood it?

03:32.402 --> 03:34.724
- No. It won't turn over.
- You leave your lights on?

03:34.901 --> 03:36.275
- No.
- You probably did.

03:36.442 --> 03:37.816
- No, I didn't. Hi.
- Hi.

03:37.984 --> 03:41.146
- Do you have any jumper cables?
- No, sorry. I take the El.

03:41.316 --> 03:44.148
I guess you're not the only one today.
Give me the keys.

03:46.023 --> 03:48.309
My husband's not really
a morning person.

03:48.481 --> 03:51.183
Hi, I'm Joyce. We moved here
a few weeks ago from Virginia.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.014
- Hi. Abby.
- We're in 205.

03:53.188 --> 03:55.226
I know. I think you guys
are right beside me.

03:55.813 --> 03:57.720
Nice meeting you.

03:57.896 --> 04:00.597
- So I guess we're neighbors.
- Just a wall between us.

04:00.770 --> 04:04.100
Well, maybe you could come over
for coffee or something sometime.

04:04.269 --> 04:07.469
- Sure.
- Hey, can we give you a ride somewhere?

04:07.644 --> 04:11.506
- No, thank you.
- Are you sure? It's really cold out there.

04:13.184 --> 04:15.091
I told you, you flooded it.

04:19.349 --> 04:21.470
Welcome to Chicago.

04:28.889 --> 04:31.969
Oh, son of a bitch.

05:23.769 --> 05:25.144
You're leaving?

05:25.312 --> 05:27.885
I phoned the Pediatric Cancer Society
to inform them...

05:28.065 --> 05:31.978
...she wasn't coming to their luncheon,
and they managed to corral me.

05:32.151 --> 05:36.397
You don't really have to do that. She
wasn't going. She just does it for effect.

05:36.572 --> 05:38.030
I'm aware of her behavior.

05:38.823 --> 05:40.899
But they actually were expecting her.

05:41.534 --> 05:44.285
- You'll be back tonight?
- You're really staying?

05:44.661 --> 05:47.282
Yes. Unless I'm not welcome.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.997
No, no.
It's just I thought you were covering.

05:51.167 --> 05:52.958
Dad's in Denver, actually.

05:56.463 --> 05:58.835
- Your father told you.
- Well, it was pretty obvious.

05:59.007 --> 06:01.961
He was here for two days
at Christmas without you.

06:02.927 --> 06:04.587
You thought he was still here.

06:05.846 --> 06:08.384
We left it a little open-ended.

06:08.848 --> 06:10.343
Really?

06:10.517 --> 06:14.300
I'm sorry, John. I should have phoned you
and let you know that I was coming.

06:14.478 --> 06:15.937
Yeah, well...

06:16.105 --> 06:17.978
It's good to see you.

06:25.488 --> 06:27.527
Sanitation guys found him in a dumpster.

06:27.697 --> 06:30.449
Minimally responsive to deep pain,
thready pulse in the 50s.

06:30.616 --> 06:32.823
- You sure he's not dead?
- He's still moving air.

06:32.994 --> 06:35.947
Barely.
Abby, can you bring this guy in?

06:36.121 --> 06:39.869
- I haven't even clocked in yet.
- I know, but you have a coat on.

06:40.250 --> 06:42.207
Hey, I know this guy.

06:42.377 --> 06:43.657
Oh, man.

06:43.836 --> 06:46.208
Is this great or what? Empty chairs.

06:46.380 --> 06:50.128
Empty racks. Nothing like subarctic
temperatures to keep the freaks at home.

06:50.300 --> 06:53.466
- Except it's freezing in here.
- Maintenance is checking the furnace.

06:53.636 --> 06:56.341
This is what we get for punching holes
in the ozone layer.

06:56.514 --> 06:58.553
Isn't the greenhouse effect
make it warmer?

06:58.723 --> 07:01.131
Greenhouse effect, my ass.
It's 40 below out there.

07:01.309 --> 07:03.515
- What's this?
- This is Icicle Andy. You want him?

07:03.687 --> 07:06.223
- He's yours.
- I thought he froze to death last year.

07:06.396 --> 07:09.231
- The Ice Man cometh back.
- Okay, Trauma 1 's open.

07:09.400 --> 07:14.025
Get his core temp, pump in some warm
saline and throw a heating blanket on him.

07:14.195 --> 07:16.318
I'd keep that on if I were you.

07:17.364 --> 07:19.024
He's bradying down.

07:19.199 --> 07:20.942
No luck. Now it's A-fib.

07:21.117 --> 07:23.275
Sounds like rhonchi on the right.

07:23.453 --> 07:26.406
- Probably pneumonia.
- I think he's decreased on the left.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.703
- Do you want to put in a chest tube?
- No.

07:28.873 --> 07:31.495
He's got bad vascular disease.
We'll never get a line in.

07:31.668 --> 07:35.534
- Fine. Prep for lavage.
- Oh, man. Look at this dude's hands.

07:35.755 --> 07:37.664
- Can you get a pulse ox?
- I don't know.

07:37.881 --> 07:39.256
I can barely get the monitor-

07:40.925 --> 07:42.669
What's wrong?

07:44.304 --> 07:47.387
- Snapped off.
- He gave you the finger, huh, Abby?

07:48.640 --> 07:51.427
- Can they re-attach that?
- Not without superglue.

07:51.602 --> 07:55.433
Okay, let's get a central-line kit, Betadine
and some warm blankets to start.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.561
No, you can't come in.
You have to go back.

07:57.731 --> 07:59.391
- Where's my mom?
- She's not in here.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.688
- Yes, she was.
- You got this?

08:01.860 --> 08:04.611
Yeah.
Warm liter of IV saline.

08:04.863 --> 08:06.689
- You lost your mom?
- A second line.

08:06.864 --> 08:10.066
- Not one of these two ladies right here?
- She was in there.

08:10.241 --> 08:13.740
Okay. Well, maybe she's all finished.
Do you want to see if we can find her?

08:13.911 --> 08:15.619
- I'm Abby. What's your name?
- Douglas.

08:15.788 --> 08:17.199
- Douglas what?
- Douglas Leeman.

08:17.373 --> 08:18.915
Okay, Douglas. Right this way.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.909
- What's your mom's name?
- Bee.

08:21.084 --> 08:24.084
Bee? Is that short for Beatrice?

08:24.253 --> 08:26.661
- Barbara? Betty?
- Just Bee.

08:26.839 --> 08:29.128
- Just Bee. Okay.
- Abby, can you help me?

08:29.300 --> 08:32.169
Sure. Frank, this is Douglas Leeman.
He's lost his mom.

08:32.344 --> 08:35.629
This is Frank.
He's very good at finding people's moms.

08:35.804 --> 08:37.679
Douglas, you like doughnuts?

08:37.847 --> 08:40.135
- When did the chest pains start?
- This morning.

08:40.308 --> 08:43.890
But I've been feeling crappy
for a couple of days.

08:44.062 --> 08:47.063
I thought it was just a cold
or maybe the flu.

08:47.231 --> 08:50.516
Bi-basilar rales. Have you experienced
any shortness of breath?

08:50.693 --> 08:53.361
Yeah. I thought I'd step outside...

08:53.528 --> 08:56.813
...catch a breath of fresh air.
I got so dizzy I fainted.

08:56.989 --> 08:58.981
Three-plus pitting edema on both feet.

08:59.408 --> 09:02.159
- Have you had anything like this before?
- Never.

09:02.327 --> 09:04.070
- Do you have a heart condition?
- No.

09:04.245 --> 09:08.990
- Are you on birth-control pills?
- No. I'm trying to get pregnant.

09:09.166 --> 09:11.704
I've been taking fertility drugs.

09:11.877 --> 09:14.083
- FSH.
- For how long?

09:15.172 --> 09:18.456
- What's today?
- Well, the 1 Oth.

09:18.841 --> 09:20.500
Yeah. Then I'm on my tenth.

09:20.676 --> 09:26.381
All right. Let's get a CBC, Chem-20,
a DIC panel, and a D-dimer.

09:26.973 --> 09:29.926
Am I having some sort of reaction
to the drugs?

09:30.101 --> 09:33.350
It's possible, but we need to run
some more tests to know for sure.

09:33.520 --> 09:37.137
You've got fluid in your lungs,
which could be a sign of a blood clot.

09:37.314 --> 09:38.345
A blood clot?

09:38.525 --> 09:41.525
It's unlikely,
but I just want to make sure.

09:41.693 --> 09:45.228
It could be a possible side effect
of the medication.

09:45.405 --> 09:48.441
Let's do a Doppler. I'll be back.

09:49.867 --> 09:52.274
- You want me to call your husband?
- I'm not married.

09:52.452 --> 09:54.741
Boyfriend?

09:55.121 --> 09:58.786
I decided to have a baby on my own.

09:58.958 --> 10:02.208
Got tired of waiting around for Mr. Right.

10:02.544 --> 10:04.583
I know that story.

10:07.674 --> 10:11.884
- Chest x-ray and EKG?
- Yeah. And set her up for a V/Q.

10:12.052 --> 10:15.551
- I haven't seen you around lately.
- I've been working nights.

10:15.763 --> 10:18.930
- How was your Christmas?
- Quiet. What did you do for New Year's?

10:19.100 --> 10:20.724
I worked.

10:20.893 --> 10:22.303
That's always fun.

10:22.477 --> 10:24.517
Did you make any resolutions?

10:24.688 --> 10:27.724
- I'm gonna help out more.
- Help out more where? Here?

10:27.899 --> 10:29.179
No. Europe.

10:29.359 --> 10:33.770
I've volunteered to go to Bosnia for two
months with Doctors Without Borders.

10:33.946 --> 10:36.234
- Bosnia?
- Yeah. I speak the language.

10:36.406 --> 10:40.450
- What brought this on?
- I don't know. Change of scenery.

10:43.161 --> 10:44.655
Good?

10:46.081 --> 10:47.326
Hey, nice hat, Snoop.

10:47.498 --> 10:49.574
Hey, Frank, you gonna
get the heat turned up?

10:49.751 --> 10:51.161
- They're working on it.
- Really?

10:51.335 --> 10:53.743
Is that why the thermostat
in the lounge says 56?

10:53.921 --> 10:56.542
Get used to it.
We're heading into another ice age...

10:56.715 --> 11:00.581
- ...like the one that killed the dinosaurs.
- Cold didn't kill them, cholesterol did.

11:00.759 --> 11:04.591
Mr. Ellison in Curtain 3 can go home.
Miss Renfew in 4 needs to be admitted.

11:04.764 --> 11:07.253
- Got a minute?
- No, not really.

11:07.432 --> 11:09.555
I hope your day's shaping up
better than mine.

11:09.726 --> 11:14.268
Doubt it. I picked up Rachel's laundry after
you left and this fell out of her jeans.

11:14.438 --> 11:17.273
- She's smoking.
- I doubt she uses it to light campfires.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.766
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

11:19.943 --> 11:22.647
- Did you find anything else in her pockets?
- No.

11:23.613 --> 11:25.023
What if it's not cigarettes?

11:25.197 --> 11:27.403
Her boyfriend tested positive
for marijuana.

11:27.574 --> 11:29.032
Ex-boyfriend.

11:29.201 --> 11:31.074
- I'll search her room.
- Is that wise?

11:31.244 --> 11:33.781
Well, if she's doing drugs,
I want to know about it.

11:33.955 --> 11:36.326
Asking her doesn't guarantee
I'm gonna get the truth.

11:36.498 --> 11:39.534
But searching her room,
that's such a violation of her privacy.

11:39.709 --> 11:41.500
You suggested I go through her pockets.

11:41.669 --> 11:43.708
- In the course of doing laundry.
- Dr. Greene?

11:43.879 --> 11:45.871
29-year-old male,
8- foot fall, no LOC.

11:46.048 --> 11:47.790
- Can we talk about this?
- Come find me.

11:47.966 --> 11:49.246
Normal vitals.

11:50.927 --> 11:54.129
This is adorable. Don't you think?

11:54.304 --> 11:56.511
It's pretty cute. You wanna buy it?

11:56.682 --> 11:59.765
No. They won't let me
send him any gifts.

12:00.685 --> 12:02.393
He must be getting pretty big now.

12:02.561 --> 12:07.306
Yeah. Oh, they sent a video of him
walking, just before Christmas.

12:08.399 --> 12:12.895
Won't be long now before he's asking
to borrow the keys to the car.

12:15.406 --> 12:19.023
You know, I'm starting to wonder
if I'm making any right decisions lately.

12:19.201 --> 12:21.240
It's mid-year.
Something will open by spring.

12:21.410 --> 12:23.652
Well, maybe they'll open back up
at County.

12:23.829 --> 12:25.537
Hey, cool.

12:26.374 --> 12:28.946
Have you seen these?
These are really neat.

12:30.627 --> 12:36.166
John, what would you say if I told you
I asked the waitress at Doc Magoo's...

12:36.340 --> 12:40.918
...if she remembered Weaver being paged
the night we lost the Marfan case?

12:41.094 --> 12:45.007
I'd say that place is full of people
with pagers.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.923
I know. I was desperate.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.766
So, what? She didn't remember?

12:50.769 --> 12:53.140
Not about Weaver getting paged.

12:53.437 --> 12:56.806
But she remembers Weaver coming back,
looking for her pager...

12:56.982 --> 12:58.725
...and finding it in the bathroom.

13:00.026 --> 13:03.690
She couldn't answer my page,
John, because she didn't have her pager.

13:03.947 --> 13:06.401
- Are you sure?
- I believe it.

13:07.199 --> 13:08.990
Don't you?

13:10.702 --> 13:12.694
Yeah, that explains it.

13:13.746 --> 13:15.703
What are you gonna do?

13:19.709 --> 13:23.042
- He died?
- Yep. Did you know him?

13:23.212 --> 13:25.288
Only as Icicle Andy.

13:25.465 --> 13:27.124
I think he was a Vietnam vet.

13:27.299 --> 13:29.872
I heard bums are reincarnated
as pigeons when they die.

13:30.051 --> 13:31.510
Really?

13:31.803 --> 13:33.926
I think it's the other way around.

13:35.431 --> 13:36.712
Check it out.

13:36.891 --> 13:39.926
Tickets to tonight's Blackhawks game.
And they're good seats too.

13:40.101 --> 13:42.971
Whoa. Where did he get those?

13:43.229 --> 13:44.723
Any ID?

13:44.897 --> 13:48.479
Just two dollars, some change
and matches.

13:48.650 --> 13:50.524
- Are you gonna keep the tickets?
- No.

13:50.693 --> 13:51.939
- Can I have them?
- No.

13:52.112 --> 13:54.603
- Why not?
- I think it's called grave robbing.

13:54.906 --> 13:59.116
- He ain't using them.
- Somebody might come to claim the body.

13:59.285 --> 14:01.775
- I'm serious.
- Yeah, right. Seriously, I need them.

14:01.953 --> 14:04.076
- No.
- Look, the tickets are only for tonight.

14:04.247 --> 14:06.204
- Nobody's coming for this guy.
- Forget it.

14:06.373 --> 14:08.081
Oh, come on, Abby.

14:08.292 --> 14:10.035
Abby, look. He's straight-up dead.

14:11.086 --> 14:13.755
- Abby, can you take a look at something?
- What patient?

14:13.921 --> 14:15.416
Mr. Paninski. Unstable angina.

14:15.590 --> 14:18.163
I called CCU.
I wanna make sure I didn't miss anything.

14:18.342 --> 14:19.586
- Did you do a rectal?
- No.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.040
- You better.
- Because...?

14:21.219 --> 14:25.596
- Because if his stool is heme positive-
- The heparin. Right. Thank you.

14:27.057 --> 14:28.600
- Frank.
- Yeah?

14:28.767 --> 14:31.140
- You said you were gonna find his mother.
- I tried.

14:31.311 --> 14:33.848
No Bee Leeman checked in today.

14:34.022 --> 14:37.141
I'm beginning to think
somebody dumped him.

14:37.483 --> 14:41.266
He said his mother was in Trauma 1. Can
you double-check it with the admit log?

14:41.445 --> 14:43.733
- Sure.
- Abby.

14:43.905 --> 14:45.280
- Hi.
- Richard.

14:45.448 --> 14:48.069
- How's it going?
- What are you doing here?

14:49.451 --> 14:52.286
I think it's colder in here than
it is outside.

14:53.622 --> 14:55.495
You look great.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.412
Thank you. Shift work becomes me.

14:59.418 --> 15:01.624
- So how are things?
- They're good.

15:01.795 --> 15:03.751
Good. That's good.

15:03.921 --> 15:06.293
You seeing anyone or...?

15:06.465 --> 15:10.462
Oh, yeah.
I'm breaking hearts all over town.

15:12.471 --> 15:14.878
What do you want, ex?

15:15.682 --> 15:19.299
- Ex?
- Yeah. Can I call you "ex"?

15:19.518 --> 15:23.467
Because it's almost like sexy, so people
might think it's short for "ecstasy"...

15:23.647 --> 15:26.896
...or "triple X,"
which stands for porn now.

15:27.066 --> 15:29.522
Except for in cartoons
where it stands for poison...

15:29.693 --> 15:32.398
...which I always thought
was funny, but...

15:33.072 --> 15:34.862
What do you want?

15:36.449 --> 15:38.322
Look, I...

15:38.910 --> 15:41.910
Well, I wanted to talk to you in person...

15:42.079 --> 15:44.616
...so you didn't hear this
through the grapevine.

15:44.789 --> 15:46.034
Oh, my God.

15:46.416 --> 15:48.455
- What?
- Are you going to jail?

15:49.751 --> 15:51.495
No.

15:54.380 --> 15:56.669
I'm getting married.

15:58.509 --> 16:00.797
- Married?
- Yeah.

16:00.969 --> 16:04.669
- You'd think I would've learned my lesson.
- I'm glad one of us did.

16:06.182 --> 16:09.681
- What, is she rich?
- Hardly. She's a teacher.

16:11.228 --> 16:15.273
- Not that one you had at the museum?
- No. No. No.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.938
Her name is Corrine. She's really great.
She's really down-to-earth.

16:19.110 --> 16:21.517
- I think you might even like her.
- How old is she?

16:21.695 --> 16:23.403
She's 34.

16:23.571 --> 16:28.279
She has a 6-year-old son, Adam.
Really great kid.

16:29.869 --> 16:31.328
You're gonna be a father?

16:31.787 --> 16:35.156
Stepfather, yeah.
It's kind of hard to believe.

16:35.332 --> 16:38.701
Yeah. Instant family.

16:38.877 --> 16:40.418
I always wanted kids. So...

16:41.086 --> 16:42.366
Since when?

16:44.340 --> 16:48.383
You know, just a while. I guess we just
never talked about it, you know?

16:53.055 --> 16:58.724
And you felt that today was the day
you had to tell me about all this?

16:58.893 --> 17:00.850
Is today a bad day?

17:05.397 --> 17:06.941
Nope.

17:09.359 --> 17:13.060
So, what?
Am I supposed to give you my blessing?

17:14.114 --> 17:17.530
- That's up to you.
- Well, I have to get back to work.

17:26.332 --> 17:28.040
Richard.

17:31.086 --> 17:32.995
I hope that it works out this time.

17:35.424 --> 17:36.581
Thanks.

17:42.249 --> 17:44.405
Aspen's great.
There's three separate mountains.

17:44.582 --> 17:46.822
So you don't have to be an expert.

17:50.041 --> 17:51.498
What is that?

17:51.665 --> 17:53.241
What?

17:54.916 --> 17:57.368
Yeah, they got runs for every level.

17:59.916 --> 18:01.705
Is that your jaw?

18:01.998 --> 18:03.871
- What?
- That click-click-click sound.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.947
- Oh, my God. You can hear that?
- Yeah.

18:06.123 --> 18:09.038
I can't help it.
I think I have this TMJ happening thing.

18:09.207 --> 18:10.747
Here. Chew.

18:11.082 --> 18:12.704
- No.
- Come on. Chew so I can hear.

18:12.873 --> 18:14.414
No.

18:15.082 --> 18:16.788
Get out of here.

18:20.582 --> 18:22.785
- I'm going back to work.
- I'll take care of this.

18:22.957 --> 18:24.154
You should see a dentist.

18:24.332 --> 18:27.531
Either that or you should find
someone else to eat lunch with.

18:31.206 --> 18:34.074
- I'm sorry about that.
- What?

18:35.206 --> 18:38.786
I should have said something sooner.
It just sort of snuck up on me.

18:39.498 --> 18:40.907
I hate it when that happens.

18:42.790 --> 18:45.704
It's really more about friendship
than anything else.

18:45.872 --> 18:47.117
Really?

18:48.248 --> 18:50.037
Never seen you kiss Frank like that.

18:51.206 --> 18:53.529
- Abby-
- Don't sweat it, Carter.

19:03.789 --> 19:06.243
- Where's Frank?
- Don't know.

19:09.580 --> 19:11.287
Hey, Douglas.

19:11.456 --> 19:13.576
Did you find your mom?

19:14.289 --> 19:16.529
- Are you getting hungry?
- Yeah.

19:16.706 --> 19:18.945
Would you like to eat pizza?

19:19.122 --> 19:20.284
A hamburger?

19:20.456 --> 19:23.406
My mom says
fast food isn't good for you.

19:24.205 --> 19:28.495
Well, she's right, but the fast food
we serve here at the hospital...

19:28.663 --> 19:32.408
...is specially formulated to be nutritious.
So would you like some French fries?

19:32.580 --> 19:34.369
Okay. Sit tight.

19:34.538 --> 19:36.410
Hey, Frank.

19:37.080 --> 19:40.031
- I'm working on it.
- Work harder. He's been here for hours.

19:40.205 --> 19:43.405
If I find his mom, can I have the
tickets you pinched off that stiff?

19:43.580 --> 19:44.990
- No.
- Anybody seen Dr. Kovac?

19:45.164 --> 19:47.403
- What do you need?
- Mrs. Sites' pressure's down.

19:47.580 --> 19:49.121
Frank, find Luka. What happened?

19:49.289 --> 19:52.902
She got dizzy. Systolic's at 80.
I opened up the saline.

19:53.079 --> 19:55.035
- How are you doing, Meryl?
- Is it a PE?

19:55.205 --> 19:58.701
I don't know. Crank her oxygen up to
15 liters and grab some dopamine...

19:58.872 --> 20:01.869
...off the crash cart.
She's got muffled heart sounds and JVD.

20:02.038 --> 20:04.609
Malik. We need a pericardiocentesis tray
and a SonoSite.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.115
- Okay.
- Pressure's down to 70.

20:06.288 --> 20:09.239
- You think it's tamponade?
- Unless you got any better ideas.

20:09.413 --> 20:12.161
- What happened?
- Hypotensive, signs of pericardial effusion.

20:12.329 --> 20:14.569
He thought she had a clot
from hyper-stimulation.

20:14.746 --> 20:17.744
You can third-space anywhere,
even around the heart.

20:18.580 --> 20:20.404
- There it is.
- Here you go, Abby.

20:20.579 --> 20:23.613
- Okay, glove up. You can assist.
- Lidocaine's ready.

20:23.788 --> 20:28.030
I think I found that kid's mom if she
doesn't have the same last name as him.

20:28.204 --> 20:31.202
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Okay, hook up the alligator clip.

20:31.370 --> 20:34.985
Belinda Mathison. Came last night
with a headache, it was a brain bleed.

20:35.162 --> 20:36.988
-45-degree angle.
- Last night?

20:37.163 --> 20:39.615
- They put her in Neurosurg.
- Watch for injury current.

20:39.787 --> 20:42.110
- That boy sat in Chairs all night.
- There it is.

20:42.287 --> 20:46.861
- Can you take him upstairs to his mother?
- That could be difficult. She's dead.

20:47.787 --> 20:49.244
What?

20:49.412 --> 20:52.612
- Blood pressure's back up to 90.
- She stroked out a few hours ago.

20:52.787 --> 20:54.576
- Second syringe.
- What should I do?

20:54.745 --> 20:57.743
- Abby?
- Well, just try to find his dad.

20:57.912 --> 21:00.579
- Systolic's one-ten.
- And get him some French fries.

21:00.746 --> 21:03.198
Okay. Good pickup.

21:06.579 --> 21:09.410
- Did you reach the father?
- He said he lives in Los Angeles.

21:09.578 --> 21:11.569
- He doesn't know the number.
- Wasn't in here?

21:11.745 --> 21:13.735
- I couldn't find it.
- You call the school?

21:13.911 --> 21:15.737
- No.
- I'm sure they have a number, Frank.

21:15.912 --> 21:17.736
- I thought you used to be a cop.
- I was.

21:17.911 --> 21:20.945
Well, act like a cop.
Track the guy down.

21:21.495 --> 21:25.074
- Someone from Neurosurg talk to him?
- Not yet.

21:25.245 --> 21:26.951
Which ER doc treated his mother?

21:27.120 --> 21:29.525
Weaver. She has a half-shift today.
She's not in yet.

21:29.703 --> 21:34.574
- Should I page someone from Neurosurg?
- They should tell him his mother died.

21:37.536 --> 21:39.029
No, she didn't.

21:44.869 --> 21:47.985
Douglas, I need to talk to you
about your mom's headache, okay?

21:48.160 --> 21:49.867
Let's sit down.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.617
All right.

21:55.744 --> 21:57.569
It was pretty bad.

21:59.577 --> 22:04.733
It was caused by a blood vessel
in her brain that ruptured.

22:05.244 --> 22:08.941
It broke.
And the doctors tried really hard...

22:09.244 --> 22:10.571
...but they couldn't fix it.

22:11.327 --> 22:12.950
Can she go home now?

22:13.536 --> 22:16.403
No, Douglas. I'm sorry. She died.

22:17.077 --> 22:19.317
My mom has a headache.
She's not sick.

22:19.494 --> 22:21.448
- I want to see her. Where is she?
- Douglas.

22:21.618 --> 22:24.569
- Mom! Mom!
- Douglas.

22:25.410 --> 22:27.448
Mom! Mom, where are you?

22:28.660 --> 22:31.113
- Douglas.
- Mom! Mom!

22:31.285 --> 22:34.485
- Mom! Mom!
- Douglas, she's dead.

22:34.660 --> 22:36.734
Stop saying that!
Why do you keep saying that?

22:36.910 --> 22:39.742
- I want my mom. I just want my mom!
- I know you do.

22:43.743 --> 22:45.614
It's okay.

22:46.952 --> 22:49.700
- He finally went down?
- He's exhausted.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.278
Poor kid.

22:51.452 --> 22:53.904
I finally got ahold of his dad.

22:54.076 --> 22:57.074
- He's in Australia on a business trip.
- Australia?

22:57.243 --> 23:00.194
The soonest flight he can get
is a red-eye tomorrow night.

23:00.368 --> 23:02.572
So Social Services have to
take him until then.

23:02.743 --> 23:05.611
- Sorry. I'll call them.
- That's all right, I'll do it. Thanks.

23:05.785 --> 23:09.232
- Can you grab me the minute he gets up?
- Sure.

23:09.409 --> 23:11.945
Abby, do we do psychiatric transfers
to other hospitals?

23:12.118 --> 23:14.024
- What?
- I have a patient in Curtain 3.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.903
He was admitted with a tiny scalp lac
from a slip and fall.

23:17.076 --> 23:20.655
He wants to be moved out of Curtain 3
and wants to call his caseworker...

23:20.826 --> 23:23.610
- ... from some private hospital.
- Is he altered from the fall?

23:23.784 --> 23:26.403
No, but he seems pretty agitated.

23:26.576 --> 23:28.863
Did you get a Psych consult?

23:29.034 --> 23:31.357
- Not yet.
- Probably wouldn't hurt.

23:34.284 --> 23:36.239
The paramedics brought me
to this hospital.

23:36.409 --> 23:38.198
I didn't want to come here.

23:38.368 --> 23:43.569
Can you just please call my caseworker
and move me to another room?

23:49.284 --> 23:52.613
Please stop. That's not necessary.

23:52.784 --> 23:55.698
- You don't have to do that.
- It's just a precaution.

23:55.867 --> 23:58.320
- What happened?
- I slipped, that's all.

23:58.492 --> 23:59.866
- This your patient?
- Yeah.

24:00.033 --> 24:03.316
I saw him in the hall.
LOC after he slipped. History of migraines.

24:03.492 --> 24:05.648
- It's not his only history.
- Why the restraints?

24:05.825 --> 24:08.527
I don't wanna cause trouble.
Please, call my caseworker.

24:08.700 --> 24:11.318
We will. Dr. Lewis.

24:11.491 --> 24:14.821
- Can you please get me out of this room?
- Don't worry, we'll move you.

24:14.991 --> 24:17.315
- What kind of caseworker?
- Psychiatric.

24:17.492 --> 24:19.896
He's monitoring my conditional release.

24:20.074 --> 24:21.982
- He has the card.
- Release from where?

24:22.158 --> 24:24.527
Dr. Lewis. Now.

24:24.949 --> 24:28.481
Okay. Two of IV Ativan,
five of Compazine and a trauma panel.

24:28.824 --> 24:30.649
Someone call my wife.

24:30.824 --> 24:32.234
He's schizophrenic.

24:32.408 --> 24:34.528
- He's been here before?
- He stabbed Carter...

24:34.699 --> 24:36.939
- ... killed a med student two years ago.
- Him?

24:37.116 --> 24:38.525
- Yeah.
- He stabbed Carter?

24:38.699 --> 24:40.073
- Yes.
- What's he doing out?

24:40.240 --> 24:44.104
I don't know. The police are coming. We
should transfer him before Carter sees.

24:44.282 --> 24:46.487
- No, I need his CT.
- Let him get it at Mercy.

24:46.658 --> 24:49.489
- He has a head injury.
- He stabbed two people in that room.

24:49.657 --> 24:51.980
- Loss of consciousness-
- And killed one of them.

24:52.157 --> 24:55.854
I won't move him and risk an intracranial
bleed. I don't care what he did.

24:56.032 --> 24:59.647
- Am I calling this psychiatrist or not?
- No. I'll call him.

24:59.824 --> 25:03.817
We'll find out his status, we'll get the CT,
and then we'll take it from there. Okay?

25:04.324 --> 25:06.990
Abby, the morgue called.
They're ready for you.

25:07.157 --> 25:09.646
Move him to the suture room.
Don't let Dr. Carter see.

25:09.824 --> 25:12.821
- I got it.
- And get his name off the board.

25:30.323 --> 25:33.108
She looks like Snow White.

25:42.823 --> 25:44.613
Mom.

25:45.323 --> 25:47.313
Mom?

25:58.823 --> 26:00.813
I drew you a picture.

26:26.864 --> 26:29.482
- You took him to the morgue?
- He didn't believe she died.

26:29.655 --> 26:30.983
Well, then you call Psych.

26:31.156 --> 26:33.857
Advice you might have given yourself
18 hours ago.

26:34.030 --> 26:37.396
Hey, hey. She vagalled in Triage.
No one told me she had a kid with her.

26:37.572 --> 26:40.321
- Well, she did.
- Did you call Social Services?

26:40.489 --> 26:43.024
- Not yet.
- Why not? Abby, why not?

26:43.197 --> 26:45.520
Because we're trying
to find another family member.

26:45.697 --> 26:47.687
- Who's we?
- Me.

26:47.863 --> 26:50.778
- It's not your job.
- Don't want him in another strange place.

26:50.947 --> 26:54.775
Their holding facility is a lot more
comforting than the ER or the morgue.

26:54.947 --> 26:58.643
They have the personnel and resources
to deal with it. Call them now.

26:58.821 --> 27:01.985
"You're honest, forthright and a judge-
A good judge of character.

27:02.155 --> 27:05.485
You often ramble incoherently when
agitated. Your dog doesn't like you. "

27:05.655 --> 27:08.143
- My dog died a year ago.
- It's a joke, Frank.

27:08.321 --> 27:10.810
- This amuses you?
- Carter, what's your sign?

27:10.988 --> 27:13.227
- Gemini, why?
- Horoscopes from the Internet.

27:13.405 --> 27:15.975
"You're open to new ideas,
compassionate, a risk-taker. "

27:16.154 --> 27:18.478
- True.
- "You overstay your welcome at parties...

27:18.655 --> 27:21.854
- ... and you often smell like cheese. "
- Don't you have some work to do?

27:22.029 --> 27:23.357
- Abby, your turn.
- No, thanks.

27:23.530 --> 27:25.070
- What's your sign?
- "Out of order. "

27:25.238 --> 27:27.145
Who moved Libertique
from the suture room?

27:27.321 --> 27:30.982
The hand surgeon is stuck in surgery
for the next 40 minutes and we needed...

27:31.154 --> 27:33.939
- ... a room for an extensor tendon repair.
- I'll do that.

27:34.113 --> 27:36.150
No, no, no. The surgical intern's got it.

27:36.321 --> 27:40.445
Can you take a look at this
explosive watery diarrhea?

27:40.612 --> 27:43.066
- You need to start an IV?
- Maybe. I don't know.

27:43.238 --> 27:45.642
He's pretty miserable.

27:45.820 --> 27:47.230
She.

27:47.404 --> 27:48.683
- She.
- You okay?

27:48.862 --> 27:50.438
Yeah.

27:54.404 --> 27:57.319
Abby, the light source on the
fiber optic's down. Get me a spare?

27:57.487 --> 28:00.022
- Okay.
- Can I see a doctor this century?

28:00.195 --> 28:02.316
- Hang on.
- I hang on any longer, I'll be dead.

28:02.487 --> 28:06.481
- If you're talking, you're not dying.
- He was not guilty by reason of insanity.

28:06.654 --> 28:09.770
- Shouldn't he be in a forensic hospital?
- He was. He was.

28:09.945 --> 28:12.860
He was moved to a less restrictive
facility about 10 months ago.

28:13.028 --> 28:15.696
And now he's on conditional release.

28:15.987 --> 28:19.648
- Bradying down to 60.
- Mg of atropine. I need that scope.

28:19.820 --> 28:21.562
- I've got it.
- Pulse ox, 78.

28:21.737 --> 28:24.141
I need a smaller tube. Number seven.
Suction.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.730
- He's agitated.
- He's nervous.

28:25.904 --> 28:28.687
He's been out of care
for less than a week, hits his head...

28:28.861 --> 28:32.274
- ... and they bring him here of all places.
- He get out in two years?

28:32.445 --> 28:35.194
- Who are you?
- I was there when he attacked my friends.

28:35.820 --> 28:39.185
I'm sorry. He was a law student.
A professor there got some colleagues...

28:39.362 --> 28:43.189
...to do some pro bono work. They filed
a writ of habeas corpus and won.

28:43.361 --> 28:45.897
- That's unbelievable.
- But I can't say I disagree.

28:46.070 --> 28:49.814
- Most schizophrenics are non-violent.
- Well, this one was, wasn't he?

28:49.986 --> 28:53.600
And when they are, they rarely are twice.
He's no danger to himself or others.

28:53.778 --> 28:55.105
- Really?
- Not on his meds.

28:55.278 --> 28:58.644
Safeguards are in place. He needs to be
supervised taking his medication.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.438
- Did he get his head CT?
- They're almost ready for him.

29:01.611 --> 29:03.851
Abby, can you check this Foley?
It's overflowing.

29:04.028 --> 29:06.480
- Clamp it.
- I did. It's overflowing.

29:06.652 --> 29:09.485
- Just get him out of here.
- I want those restraints removed.

29:09.653 --> 29:11.477
- No.
- He is coherent and lucid.

29:11.652 --> 29:13.442
- I worked with him for over a year.
- No.

29:13.611 --> 29:15.400
- Abby.
- Susan, I swear to God-

29:15.569 --> 29:18.318
- Abby, I got it.
- Keep somebody posted outside his door.

29:18.486 --> 29:21.353
- But he needs reassurance and respect.
- Respect?

29:21.527 --> 29:23.684
- Yes!
- I'm sorry. He needs our respect?

29:23.861 --> 29:25.139
Abby, go.

29:31.235 --> 29:33.143
Looks like over a liter in the last hour.

29:33.319 --> 29:35.392
BP's 110/70, and her sats are up.

29:35.568 --> 29:37.725
Good. You need to send out
a repeat potassium.

29:37.902 --> 29:39.560
Right. Thanks.

29:39.735 --> 29:42.105
He said something about the ICU.

29:42.277 --> 29:45.559
Yeah. Maybe for a couple of days,
just for safety.

29:45.735 --> 29:48.188
It's the fertility drugs, isn't it,
that's doing this?

29:48.360 --> 29:51.643
The doctor has to review your labs.

29:55.609 --> 29:58.228
I could try to find him now if you like.

29:58.401 --> 30:00.392
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

30:01.568 --> 30:05.147
It must be the damn hormones.
I'm not usually a crier.

30:05.317 --> 30:07.060
It's okay.

30:10.109 --> 30:13.143
Sometimes being a woman sucks,
you know?

30:13.359 --> 30:15.481
It has its moments.

30:15.651 --> 30:19.146
You grow up praying you don't
get pregnant every time you have sex.

30:19.317 --> 30:22.481
And then when you finally do want
to have a baby, you can't.

30:22.651 --> 30:24.143
It's so unfair.

30:24.693 --> 30:27.477
Have you been trying for a long time?

30:27.859 --> 30:31.142
I just keep thinking that maybe
I had my chance and I blew it.

30:31.401 --> 30:35.560
- You don't know that.
- No. I've been pregnant.

30:35.734 --> 30:38.187
A few years ago. It was an accident.

30:38.359 --> 30:43.146
I had just started a new job
and this new relationship.

30:43.317 --> 30:45.142
It didn't seem like the right time.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.724
- It happens.
- I only waited until I was ready...

30:48.901 --> 30:51.981
...so that I could be the best mother
I could be.

30:53.526 --> 30:55.148
I'm sure you're going to be.

30:56.109 --> 30:57.898
Unless I waited too long.

31:11.900 --> 31:14.981
- Weaver's looking for you.
- What?

31:15.150 --> 31:18.101
She wants to know why you didn't
call Family Services on the boy.

31:18.275 --> 31:20.728
I am. I will. Fine.

31:26.358 --> 31:31.145
I'm gonna check in with my office and get
some release paperwork. I'll be right back.

31:38.816 --> 31:41.139
The on-call social worker for the ER,
please.

31:41.317 --> 31:43.354
- Someone claim them?
- What?

31:43.899 --> 31:46.981
- The tickets.
- Oh, no.

31:47.150 --> 31:48.891
Lewis was asking. Give her one.

31:50.190 --> 31:53.722
- Thank you.
- No, just have him paged. Thanks.

31:54.024 --> 31:58.148
Abby, when you have time, I need a thick
and thin smear and culture in Curtain 3.

31:58.316 --> 32:00.520
- Yeah.
- Your diarrhea patient was heme negative.

32:00.691 --> 32:02.977
Just PO challenged.
I sent him home with Imodium.

32:03.149 --> 32:07.308
I have a 5-year-old with abdominal pain,
and I'm worried about intussusception.

32:07.899 --> 32:09.855
- Is there any blood in the stool?
- No.

32:10.024 --> 32:12.098
- But he had a palpable mass.
- There he is.

32:12.274 --> 32:14.727
- Hey, sweetheart.
- There's Daddy.

32:15.149 --> 32:17.305
Hey. Hi.

32:17.482 --> 32:19.935
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Carter.

32:20.107 --> 32:24.729
Daddy slipped, and he fell.
And he hit his head, but I'm okay.

32:24.899 --> 32:27.434
- They put you in restraints.
- It's just a precaution.

32:27.607 --> 32:29.728
They're a little paranoid.

32:33.982 --> 32:35.889
Oh, it's you.

32:37.815 --> 32:39.142
I'm sorry.

32:39.690 --> 32:44.643
- What happened? What's he doing here?
- He slipped outside his office building.

32:45.565 --> 32:48.812
- His office building?
- He's on conditional release.

32:50.398 --> 32:52.934
- You're out?
- I'm better.

32:53.107 --> 32:54.729
I'm sorry.

32:54.898 --> 32:58.015
That wasn't me who did that to you,
to your friend.

32:58.190 --> 32:59.979
You know that, right?

33:00.314 --> 33:02.519
You're a doctor.
You know it's a disease.

33:04.106 --> 33:06.143
I'm being treated.

33:06.439 --> 33:07.980
I'm okay now.

33:12.565 --> 33:13.974
Great.

33:14.148 --> 33:16.108
I'm glad you're okay.

33:51.028 --> 33:54.897
I think I'm starting to get it. Although,
that little puck is hard to keep track of.

33:55.075 --> 33:57.864
They should give it a color
so your eye can follow it.

33:58.038 --> 33:59.283
- What, the puck?
- Yes.

33:59.456 --> 34:03.456
I mean, like bright pink or red
or flashing lights or something.

34:03.629 --> 34:06.915
- Okay, a flashing, pink puck.
- Well, why not?

34:07.092 --> 34:09.418
- It's gonna be a great game.
- It's hockey. Come on.

34:09.596 --> 34:12.170
- I love hockey.
- You got the tickets?

34:12.808 --> 34:16.475
- Hey. Hey, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

34:16.647 --> 34:17.976
- I hugged him.
- You what?

34:18.148 --> 34:20.902
Oh, yeah. I'm the Bruce Lee of love, girl.

34:24.658 --> 34:27.446
- Maybe I just need some fresh air.
- Hold- Wait a minute.

34:27.621 --> 34:28.866
You're not out.

34:29.873 --> 34:31.534
- Who are you hiding from?
- I'm not.

34:31.708 --> 34:35.127
Wait a minute. Then what was that? You
don't want your friends to see us?

34:35.297 --> 34:39.462
- They're not friends. They work for me.
- How do you think that makes me feel?

34:39.637 --> 34:42.591
- I'm sorry.
- You came on to me. You are not out.

34:42.766 --> 34:45.388
I am not out at work.

34:45.561 --> 34:47.270
- Well, you need to be.
- Sandy-

34:47.438 --> 34:50.476
I'm sorry. I don't got time for this.

34:54.489 --> 34:56.068
- Okay.
- I'll come from the airport.

34:56.242 --> 34:58.117
Okay.

34:58.746 --> 35:00.823
Bye, Dad.
He'll be here tomorrow.

35:00.999 --> 35:02.577
Great.

35:03.210 --> 35:07.080
- Have you ever been to Los Angeles?
- Once. Disneyland.

35:07.424 --> 35:09.133
I think you'll like it there.

35:09.302 --> 35:12.922
Because it's sunny.
It's not cold like it is here.

35:16.729 --> 35:18.438
Excuse me?

35:20.025 --> 35:23.277
- Can you give this to Dr. Carter?
- I think you better do that.

35:23.572 --> 35:26.942
Oh, they're discharging Paul.
I have to drive him home.

35:30.581 --> 35:33.038
They wouldn't have released him
if he weren't better.

35:33.877 --> 35:36.500
He's taking his meds. He's in therapy.

35:37.466 --> 35:41.168
He has a disease, but it's being treated.
I mean, that's what you do here.

35:41.346 --> 35:43.921
You treat disease so people
can try to move on with life.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.093
Yeah.

35:46.269 --> 35:47.930
He's my husband.

35:48.105 --> 35:49.980
We're his family.

35:50.275 --> 35:51.651
I can't give up on him.

35:53.280 --> 35:55.190
Good luck.

36:09.134 --> 36:10.879
Hey.

36:15.017 --> 36:19.396
Lewis discharged Sobriki,
and his wife asked me to give you this.

36:20.483 --> 36:23.485
I guess you couldn't protect me
from her either?

36:27.033 --> 36:30.486
- Yeah. I'm sorry about that. I just-
- Don't worry about it. Forget it.

36:31.749 --> 36:34.870
- Are you off already?
- Half-shift.

36:36.338 --> 36:38.332
I'm off in a half-hour
if you want to go eat.

36:38.508 --> 36:40.382
I should get home.

36:41.011 --> 36:45.225
Or maybe just coffee and pie?

36:45.684 --> 36:48.473
I had a pretty crappy day myself.

36:49.356 --> 36:52.062
Gam is out of the convalescent
hospital. I should go home-

36:52.235 --> 36:55.687
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.823
Thank you for asking.

36:58.201 --> 37:00.279
Anytime.

37:04.460 --> 37:06.454
- No!
- I have a nice place for you to stay...

37:06.630 --> 37:08.290
- ... till he gets here.
- I wanna stay!

37:08.466 --> 37:09.795
- But you can't.
- Abby!

37:09.968 --> 37:12.008
- I want to stay here.
- I know.

37:12.179 --> 37:15.549
But this is a hospital, and you have to go
someplace where you can sleep.

37:15.725 --> 37:18.681
- No.
- And get something to eat, take a bath.

37:18.854 --> 37:21.144
- I'll stay with you.
- Douglas, I don't-

37:21.316 --> 37:24.070
- No!
- I don't stay here all the time, honey.

37:24.237 --> 37:27.405
But you can come visit me
whenever you want, okay? I promise.

37:27.575 --> 37:29.485
- No. Abby.
- I got you.

37:29.745 --> 37:32.747
Come on. We'll get you some ice cream
when we get there.

37:32.916 --> 37:36.037
- You'll be fine, Douglas.
- Wait! I'll stay with you!

37:36.212 --> 37:40.127
Abby, please! Abby!

37:47.937 --> 37:50.428
Abby, my cellulitis patient
is allergic to penicillin.

37:50.607 --> 37:52.232
- No.
- Can you give IV erythromycin?

37:52.401 --> 37:53.646
- No.
- Vancomycin?

37:53.819 --> 37:56.228
No. I am not your Attending.
I'm not a Resident.

37:56.406 --> 38:00.276
I'm a nurse. You want me to assess
a patient, you want me to push meds...

38:00.454 --> 38:04.499
...you want me to check vitals, explain
the situation to a family member, fine.

38:04.668 --> 38:06.993
What I will not do is carry you
through med school.

38:07.171 --> 38:10.173
You want to be a doctor,
start acting like one.

38:11.468 --> 38:13.795
Rachel, can I talk to you?

38:57.323 --> 39:00.409
- What are you doing?
- Just picking your stuff up.

39:00.578 --> 39:02.535
- You're searching my room.
- It's a pigsty.

39:02.705 --> 39:05.542
That doesn't give you the right
to go through my things.

39:06.961 --> 39:08.753
You mean these things?

39:09.340 --> 39:11.713
- I can't believe you did this.
- Are you smoking now?

39:11.885 --> 39:13.380
I asked you a question. Rachel!

39:13.554 --> 39:16.509
- Are these your cigarettes?
- I bought that a month ago on a dare.

39:16.683 --> 39:18.428
- Dare?
- To see if I could pass for 18.

39:18.602 --> 39:20.976
- And the condoms?
- I got them in health class.

39:21.148 --> 39:23.438
- And you kept them?
- You'd rather I not have them?

39:23.609 --> 39:25.768
- You need to stop lying.
- You don't believe me.

39:25.946 --> 39:29.696
- You search my room and private things.
- I was looking for drugs.

39:30.744 --> 39:32.821
You said you were picking up.
Who's lying now?

39:32.997 --> 39:37.293
You're right. The truth is I was searching
your room. I don't know if I can trust you.

39:37.586 --> 39:41.253
Then fine. Believe whatever you want.
I'm smoking. I'm on drugs.

39:41.425 --> 39:45.045
And I'm having sex.
Lots of sex with lots of guys because...

39:45.222 --> 39:48.224
...I'm the school slut. You happy?

40:01.662 --> 40:04.866
This is John Carter. I have a private-duty
nurse for my grandmother...

40:05.041 --> 40:06.620
...who was supposed to start today.

40:06.793 --> 40:08.252
She's not here.

40:08.421 --> 40:09.797
Yeah.

40:09.964 --> 40:12.207
I sent her home early.

40:12.426 --> 40:14.218
- What?
- She was aggravating Millicent...

40:14.387 --> 40:17.259
...so I sent her home early.
She'll be back at 6 a. m.

40:18.476 --> 40:20.136
It's a 24-hour service.

40:20.312 --> 40:23.397
I'll get up if there's a problem.

40:24.234 --> 40:26.561
- What are you doing?
- Pardon?

40:26.946 --> 40:29.070
I mean, you show up unannounced,
uninvited.

40:29.784 --> 40:32.738
- Uninvited?
- Then you make health-care decisions?

40:32.913 --> 40:36.117
Your grandma asked me to ask her
to leave. I was trying to be helpful.

40:36.292 --> 40:39.994
Well, do me a favor. Don't try to be
helpful. It's not one of your strong suits.

40:40.172 --> 40:41.751
Excuse me, John.

40:41.925 --> 40:44.251
I've had enough abuse
from my mother-in-law today.

40:44.428 --> 40:47.763
- I don't need any more from my son.
- I'm sorry?

40:47.933 --> 40:50.092
I'm sorry,
but I have helped Gamma through this.

40:50.269 --> 40:53.854
I have tended to her medical needs.
I've made her health-care arrangements.

40:54.024 --> 40:57.193
So you need to consult with me
before you do anything like this.

40:57.363 --> 40:59.937
- Fine. Call them back.
- Yeah. You bet I will.

41:00.116 --> 41:03.736
But I'm not leaving this house,
and I don't care if I'm uninvited.

41:03.913 --> 41:07.331
I'm not gonna let your father
break up this family.

41:07.543 --> 41:10.546
- Family? What family would that be?
- Don't be sarcastic.

41:10.714 --> 41:13.835
You checked out of this family
20 years ago.

41:15.012 --> 41:16.721
- Excuse me. I'm going to bed.
- No.

41:16.889 --> 41:20.592
I won't let you put a revisionist spin
on this with you as the injured party. No.

41:20.770 --> 41:23.606
- Step aside.
- No! I got stabbed!

41:23.774 --> 41:26.100
I got stabbed in the back!
Where the hell were you?

41:27.737 --> 41:30.942
You were the same place you've
been my entire life, someplace else.

41:31.243 --> 41:33.152
- We came back.
- Three weeks later.

41:33.328 --> 41:35.488
We were stuck in Tokyo.
You said you were fine.

41:35.665 --> 41:37.374
I wasn't fine. I wasn't okay.

41:38.670 --> 41:40.793
Are you gonna blame me
for taking drugs?

41:40.965 --> 41:44.132
No. I am blaming you
for not being my mother!

41:49.517 --> 41:51.557
Bobby died.

41:52.397 --> 41:53.808
And I lost a mother.

41:59.907 --> 42:01.900
May I go to bed now?

42:16.221 --> 42:18.428
Yeah. Run away.

42:46.387 --> 42:48.380
Oh, God.

42:49.683 --> 42:52.222
- Thank you.
- Gotta call the super about that too.

42:52.396 --> 42:54.519
It gets stuck in the cold.

42:54.690 --> 42:57.313
And I'm guessing it's gonna stay cold
for a while.

42:57.486 --> 42:59.278
Hopefully not this cold.

42:59.447 --> 43:02.698
Good. I told Brian
January wasn't the best time to move.

43:02.868 --> 43:05.787
But that's when the semester starts.
He's in law school.

43:05.955 --> 43:07.830
Did you get locked out?

43:08.000 --> 43:11.003
We had a fight.
So I went to the store.

43:11.255 --> 43:14.090
Another half-hour he'll be asleep.

43:15.886 --> 43:18.010
You from Chicago?

43:18.181 --> 43:21.432
- For a while now. Yeah.
- Originally?

43:21.811 --> 43:23.769
Minnesota. You?

43:23.938 --> 43:27.807
Idaho. The potato part,
not the white-supremacist part.

43:27.986 --> 43:29.729
- You want a beer?
- No, thanks.

43:29.905 --> 43:31.530
Come on.

43:31.700 --> 43:34.535
Have a seat.
You look like you've had a long day.

43:39.710 --> 43:41.584
Thank you.

43:49.056 --> 43:51.180
You got a card.

43:54.231 --> 43:56.307
It's nice to get one
personal piece of mail...

43:56.483 --> 43:59.190
...mixed in with all the bills and junk.

43:59.487 --> 44:01.362
Your birthday?

44:03.118 --> 44:05.905
- Is it your birthday?
- Yes.

44:06.080 --> 44:07.871
Today?

44:08.834 --> 44:10.376
8:03 p. m.

44:10.545 --> 44:14.294
Well, congratulations.
You've made it. Happy birthday.

44:15.718 --> 44:17.589
Thank you.
