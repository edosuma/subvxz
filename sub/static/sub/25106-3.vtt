00:30.321 --> 00:31.531
Okay, whenever you're ready.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.603
Thanks for the fluff, DJ Bear Dick.

01:02.395 --> 01:03.480
Dilly-dilly, fam!

03:25.580 --> 03:28.333
Excuse me,
can I ask you a question?

03:36.341 --> 03:38.259
Bart Simpson is a girl?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.180
Well, you were awesome!

03:43.306 --> 03:46.142
And, um, when I grow up
I want to be just like you.

03:47.602 --> 03:48.770
Okay!

03:49.479 --> 03:51.814
Do you have any tips for kids
who want to be DJs?

05:56.355 --> 05:58.066
This here is Slizzard country.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.550
Hey, hey!

06:26.803 --> 06:28.137
You boys on private property!

06:29.055 --> 06:30.055
You better watch it!

06:30.348 --> 06:32.108
I know some karate videos
I can throw at you.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.048
Nah, he's in prison.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.001
What do you think he did?

11:53.629 --> 11:55.756
I'm cold.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.926
Let's do this.

12:41.802 --> 12:42.970
DJ Slizzard, here we come.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.256
Well, well, well, Miss Sorrento.

13:20.424 --> 13:22.134
Me likey.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.763
Now why don't you put something
on the glass?

13:26.055 --> 13:27.223
Chef's choice.

13:27.556 --> 13:28.641
Omakase!

15:06.655 --> 15:09.366
I mean, have you even seen
these "Mole Women"?

15:09.575 --> 15:11.535
There is a reason they're named

15:11.911 --> 15:13.471
after the least attractive insectivore.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.748
To quote my personal hero

15:15.873 --> 15:16.999
and, I don't know

15:17.207 --> 15:18.208
the President

15:59.375 --> 16:02.136
I didn't know that the monkeys who work
in my factories were underage!

16:25.651 --> 16:26.651
My fantasy bunker?

18:02.873 --> 18:03.916
Hey, he's here.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.127
Hey, everyone.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.253
I said M'kay.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.380
Hashtag pennies.

19:06.061 --> 19:09.731
Do you accept a collect call
from Grundel County Men's Prison?

19:11.150 --> 19:12.359
Yes, I do.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.058
What do you mean you're "out"?!

19:15.028 --> 19:16.228
You're leaving me hanging, man

19:16.405 --> 19:18.323
like my cellmate
who couldn't take it anymore.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.019
You're like the "Drunk History" guy.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.957
You got Tiffany Haddish right here

19:27.541 --> 19:29.418
and you're making this about you?!

20:09.416 --> 20:10.792
Where's the off switch?

20:12.961 --> 20:14.504
There it is.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.072
Turn off the camera!

20:41.198 --> 20:42.783
The documentary's off!

20:49.331 --> 20:51.250
Hey, yo!
Take off your wrap gifts, guys!

20:51.708 --> 20:54.127
The documentary is not over.

20:54.962 --> 20:57.130
I might need a wedding DJ after all.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.926
Someone posted on Karen Sorrento's
Facebook page...

21:01.885 --> 21:03.345
But that's a straight man

21:03.971 --> 21:05.681
and Karen is you pretending to be...

21:05.931 --> 21:08.850
I just need a win, Scott.

21:32.708 --> 21:35.168
Instead of a tip I just wrote,
"Here's a tip, try the cheese."

21:36.586 --> 21:37.586
She's probably mad.

21:38.672 --> 21:39.672
This is mad fun.

21:40.549 --> 21:41.675
But I gotta come clean...

21:43.051 --> 21:44.261
I'm not a beautiful woman.

22:58.627 --> 22:59.627
Richard's file?

24:35.515 --> 24:38.977
Total fabulosity.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.102
Marco Americano here is crazy.

27:26.811 --> 27:29.189
What you've just described is a horse.

27:29.689 --> 27:30.689
I'm out.

28:16.611 --> 28:18.112
I'll never divorce you, Dick!

28:18.113 --> 28:20.193
I'll never divorce you, Dick!
Not even when pigs fly!

28:20.990 --> 28:22.324
But that would be cute!

28:22.325 --> 28:24.828
But that would be cute!
Birds would be like, "Whaaaaat?!"

28:25.078 --> 28:26.704
I'm never divorcing you!
