WEBVTT

00:00.753 --> 00:02.852
Previously on "Station 19"...

00:02.878 --> 00:04.879
I can't move my legs.
I can't even feel them.

00:04.913 --> 00:06.714
You are harboring a fugitive.

00:06.748 --> 00:08.215
I'm not sure when we'll see
each other again.

00:08.250 --> 00:10.217
Might be time for me
to quit firefighting.

00:10.252 --> 00:12.153
Maya Bishop will
be promoted to Lieutenant.

00:12.187 --> 00:14.121
There's an opening at Station 23.

00:14.156 --> 00:15.990
This isn't working. Us.

00:16.024 --> 00:18.192
- I'm the Chief.
- I'm a grown woman consenting.

00:18.226 --> 00:20.394
- What's going on, Dean?
- Just hear us out.

00:20.429 --> 00:21.948
As Interim Captain, I'm benching you

00:21.983 --> 00:23.298
- until you get some help.
- Unbelievable.

00:23.332 --> 00:24.565
No.

00:24.599 --> 00:26.400
There were a hundred
people at that ceremony,

00:26.435 --> 00:28.302
watching me freeze on that stage.

00:28.337 --> 00:30.722
You're the only one who gets why.

00:31.006 --> 00:33.207
Before you run into a fire,

00:33.241 --> 00:35.343
you have to try
to understand its identity.

00:36.311 --> 00:38.079
What caused it? Where did it start?

00:38.113 --> 00:39.714
How do we put it out?

00:41.616 --> 00:42.550
Mm.

00:43.618 --> 00:45.319
Your feet are on my pillow.

00:45.354 --> 00:47.154
What if we just...
didn't go into work today?

00:47.189 --> 00:48.756
I don't want your feet on my pillow.

00:48.790 --> 00:50.858
I bet we could find some B-shift guys

00:50.892 --> 00:52.093
to cover for us.

00:52.127 --> 00:53.581
Playing hooky for one day

00:53.616 --> 00:56.149
isn't gonna get you out of
doing your big interview.

00:56.184 --> 00:57.935
It's not just that.
I mean, it is partly that.

00:57.969 --> 01:01.022
I do not want to sit
with some perky hair-bow

01:01.056 --> 01:03.088
asking me perky hair-bow questions.

01:03.113 --> 01:04.480
I highly doubt the Mayor's office

01:04.513 --> 01:06.449
is gonna send a reporter with a hair bow.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.651
I just have this pit in my stomach.

01:08.685 --> 01:11.320
I've never wanted to play hooky
before in my life.

01:11.355 --> 01:13.422
Work just feels... blah.

01:13.457 --> 01:15.625
It's never been blah.

01:15.659 --> 01:18.427
Yeah, I don't exactly
want to go in today, either.

01:18.462 --> 01:19.601
Gibson's back,

01:19.635 --> 01:22.465
meaning I will be joining
the slugs at Station 23

01:22.499 --> 01:23.599
any minute now.

01:23.634 --> 01:25.668
Andy? Are you in there?

01:25.702 --> 01:27.436
Ryan's here. Again.

01:27.471 --> 01:28.773
I'll be out in a minute!

01:28.808 --> 01:31.540
Otherwise, you'll find
yourself ill-prepared...

01:31.575 --> 01:33.509
Okay, I guess I'll put on some coffee...

01:33.543 --> 01:34.644
...and totally exposed.

01:34.678 --> 01:35.645
...and some pants.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.546
So we observe, identify,

01:37.581 --> 01:39.215
extinguish, done.

01:39.249 --> 01:40.249
No pants?

01:40.283 --> 01:43.519
He's walking around out there
with no pants on?

01:43.553 --> 01:45.688
You know how I feel about that
on my upholstery.

01:45.722 --> 01:49.225
So warm in here and so comfy.

01:49.259 --> 01:50.660
Boy. Kitchen.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.662
Find. Now!

01:52.696 --> 01:53.963
Okay...

01:53.997 --> 01:56.532
If only it were ever really that easy.

01:56.566 --> 01:57.633
Ew.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.637
Good morning.

02:01.672 --> 02:02.705
- Good morning.
- Oh. Mm.

02:05.108 --> 02:06.709
Mm. Mm!

02:06.743 --> 02:07.910
Good morning.

02:07.944 --> 02:09.745
Mm, what's for breakfast?

02:09.780 --> 02:11.480
We seem to be having

02:11.515 --> 02:13.983
- a lot of good mornings together lately.
- Mm-hmm.

02:14.017 --> 02:16.752
And Maya's making me
go to work today, but...

02:16.787 --> 02:17.887
I think we have a quick minute

02:17.921 --> 02:20.389
to make this morning

02:20.424 --> 02:21.357
even better.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.059
I mean, um...

02:23.093 --> 02:24.427
we seem to be doing a thing here,

02:24.461 --> 02:26.162
but we haven't really
said what that thing is.

02:26.196 --> 02:28.030
Ryan Tanner.

02:28.065 --> 02:31.267
I know you know what that thing is.

02:31.301 --> 02:32.768
I think we should just
set up some ground rules.

02:32.803 --> 02:35.271
Define it a little so we're
both on the same page.

02:35.305 --> 02:36.739
Like, let's agree...

02:36.773 --> 02:39.341
...this isn't anything serious, so...

02:39.376 --> 02:41.577
we don't need to talk
about serious stuff.

02:41.611 --> 02:43.446
- My turn?
- Sure.

02:43.480 --> 02:44.747
No booty calls after 10:00.

02:44.781 --> 02:46.115
- W...
- Nope.

02:46.149 --> 02:48.250
- Make it midnight. A girl's got needs.
- Oh.

02:48.285 --> 02:51.520
And let's agree to be
honest with each other.

02:51.555 --> 02:52.730
No games. No secrets.

02:52.764 --> 02:55.293
Because I thought we were
just having fun.

02:55.327 --> 02:58.634
- We are.
- Fun with rules and regulations

02:58.669 --> 03:00.529
and definitions?

03:00.564 --> 03:02.398
- I have to get to work.
- Uh, what about...

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:16.413 --> 03:17.980
Hm.

03:18.014 --> 03:19.048
Hot.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.917
I meant the coffee.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.152
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

03:23.186 --> 03:24.620
- Oh, yeah?
- Stop.

03:24.654 --> 03:25.694
Don't.

03:25.728 --> 03:27.757
D-D-Don't come any closer
until you towel off.

03:27.791 --> 03:30.559
Oh, y-you want the towel off? All right.

03:31.828 --> 03:32.828
What are you doing?!

03:32.863 --> 03:34.230
You're terrible!

03:35.999 --> 03:38.067
You... You're all wet.

03:38.101 --> 03:39.468
- Warm me up.
- Mm.

03:47.043 --> 03:48.444
Sorry.

03:51.848 --> 03:53.315
Who is Jennifer?

03:54.684 --> 03:56.418
My sister.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.388
Oh, she says, "hi" by the way.

03:59.456 --> 04:00.990
You told your sister about me?

04:01.024 --> 04:02.684
Of course.

04:03.059 --> 04:04.760
I didn't think we were telling people.

04:04.795 --> 04:07.463
I definitely didn't think we
were "of course" telling people.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.864
I thought we were trying
to keep a low profile.

04:08.899 --> 04:11.234
Ah, she doesn't care about any of that.

04:11.701 --> 04:13.153
And she's my sister.

04:13.703 --> 04:16.038
I talk to her about all
the important parts of my life.

04:16.072 --> 04:17.866
So I guess I should just...

04:18.308 --> 04:19.975
tell all of my friends about us, then?

04:20.010 --> 04:21.844
If you want to.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.818
Now it's work.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.085
Sorry.

04:36.893 --> 04:39.061
She looks tense.
I wish I could read lips.

04:39.095 --> 04:40.796
This is the reporter
from the Mayor's office?

04:40.831 --> 04:42.464
Maybe they'll give her
the key to the city.

04:42.499 --> 04:44.834
Well, whatever happens, we
can't let her see us watching.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.535
Anybody talk to Gibson yet?

04:46.570 --> 04:47.870
Talked to me about what?

04:47.904 --> 04:50.197
- Hey!
- Hey! Good to see you, man!

04:51.107 --> 04:52.908
- You feeling good?
- If there's anything you need,

04:52.943 --> 04:54.844
- you know...
- Thanks. Yeah, just as long

04:54.878 --> 04:56.645
as nobody says the word "skyscraper."

04:56.680 --> 04:59.215
It could, um, undo months of therapy.

05:01.518 --> 05:02.818
Kidding!

05:02.853 --> 05:03.919
Hm.

05:03.954 --> 05:04.887
Lighten up, guys. All I wanna do

05:04.921 --> 05:07.523
is get back to work...
the job, all right?

05:11.962 --> 05:14.897
Are you sure you don't need
another month or two of therapy?

05:14.931 --> 05:17.833
'Cause I'd really like to not transfer.

05:17.868 --> 05:19.636
Tough luck, Bishop.

05:20.303 --> 05:22.905
I'm waiting in the Beanery,
and I find you all out here?

05:22.939 --> 05:24.907
Bishop, you and Andy
are on Aid Car today.

05:24.941 --> 05:26.609
Hughes... stock the rigs.

05:26.643 --> 05:28.210
Warren... hoses.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.578
- Gibson, Miller...
- Yep.

05:29.613 --> 05:30.846
...tools maintenance.

05:32.549 --> 05:34.116
You know, I can handle the tools myself.

05:34.150 --> 05:35.751
I'll join Herrera and Bishop.

05:35.785 --> 05:37.620
Aid Car 19,

05:37.654 --> 05:39.388
medical response, Hyde Park,

05:39.422 --> 05:41.023
743 Memorial Parkway.

05:41.057 --> 05:43.192
Miller, go grab Herrera!

05:43.226 --> 05:45.261
First day back. How are you feeling?

05:45.295 --> 05:47.863
Last day as Interim Captain.
How are you feeling?

05:47.898 --> 05:49.398
- I'm fine.
- I'm fine, too.

05:56.006 --> 05:57.273
The reporter asked me

05:57.307 --> 05:59.775
my favorite thing
about being a firefighter.

05:59.809 --> 06:02.745
I told her that I liked the color red.

06:04.414 --> 06:06.215
Is everything really so "blah" that

06:06.249 --> 06:07.983
that's the best answer I could manage?

06:08.018 --> 06:09.818
You've lost your firegasm.

06:09.853 --> 06:11.754
Your f-fi-fire what, now?

06:13.156 --> 06:15.491
Oh, no. What if that happens to me?

06:15.525 --> 06:18.961
What if working at 23
kills all my firegasms?

06:18.995 --> 06:20.763
Right there. That's our patient.

06:23.825 --> 06:26.468
Ma'am, Seattle FD. Is this the victim?

06:26.503 --> 06:28.737
- How can we help?
- I came back from my truck,

06:28.772 --> 06:29.939
and... and she was just there.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.125
I don't know what happened.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.908
Let's grab a C-collar and some 4x4s.

06:32.943 --> 06:35.077
- Help her, please.
- I think I...

06:35.111 --> 06:36.845
Am I bleeding?

06:36.880 --> 06:37.947
Can you take me to the hospital?

06:37.982 --> 06:39.061
Can you tell us what happened?

06:39.095 --> 06:41.231
Did someone hit you? Did you fall?

06:41.265 --> 06:42.985
I didn't know what else to do.

06:43.019 --> 06:44.920
It's okay. All right?
We got it from here.

06:44.955 --> 06:47.790
- Thank you for your help.
- Here, I got it. I got it.

06:52.796 --> 06:54.596
Normal response, but pupils are dilated.

06:54.631 --> 06:55.871
Possible concussion.

06:55.906 --> 06:58.467
It's a lot of bleeding...
pretty deep laceration.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.102
Wh... What's going on? Where am I?

07:00.136 --> 07:01.404
Can you tell us your name?

07:02.839 --> 07:04.707
No. I, uh...

07:04.741 --> 07:08.177
I-I can't remember it.

07:08.211 --> 07:09.778
I don't know who I am.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.587
- Ah, got my workout in.
- Wow.

07:17.621 --> 07:19.722
- Took my bike.
- I can see that.

07:19.756 --> 07:21.490
Cycling takes a lot more

07:21.524 --> 07:24.026
than physical prowess, you know?

07:24.060 --> 07:25.494
It's a whole mind-body sport.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.796
Oh, yeah. More than golf lessons
or the Pilates

07:27.831 --> 07:30.065
or every other hobby you've picked up

07:30.100 --> 07:32.134
since you broke up with Grant?

07:32.168 --> 07:33.836
I haven't found my perfect cadence yet.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.304
The guy at my neighborhood LBS...

07:35.338 --> 07:36.905
- local bike shop...
- Okay.

07:36.940 --> 07:38.089
...says that it can
take months, and, uh...

07:38.123 --> 07:40.909
Great, great. I actually h... I have
something I need to talk to you about.

07:40.944 --> 07:43.746
Maintenance is a must. If your
saddle's not properly aligned,

07:43.780 --> 07:45.514
- then that can lead to a lot of chaffing.
- No, you know what?

07:45.548 --> 07:47.649
- Align it, or else you...
- Bye-bye, bike. No more bike.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.051
Just me now. Please.

07:49.085 --> 07:51.653
You know, maybe instead of making fun,

07:51.688 --> 07:52.755
you could show a little support.

07:52.789 --> 07:54.690
I am! I am. I was.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.425
It's just... It's so many
hobbies requiring,

07:56.459 --> 07:58.927
you know, so... so much support.

07:58.962 --> 08:00.996
And I'm telling you, Trav, I mean it.

08:01.031 --> 08:02.498
I need to talk to you about something.

08:02.532 --> 08:03.899
Well, maybe you should've
thought about that

08:03.933 --> 08:06.035
before you belittled my bicycle.

08:09.305 --> 08:11.173
Is there anything you can remember?

08:11.207 --> 08:12.475
I...

08:13.043 --> 08:15.010
No, I'm sorry.

08:15.045 --> 08:16.445
- Are we going to the hospital?
- Yes, ma'am.

08:16.479 --> 08:18.914
We just need to make sure
you're stabilized first.

08:18.948 --> 08:20.616
Placing the pulse ox.

08:20.650 --> 08:22.051
If she experienced
any kind of blunt trauma,

08:22.085 --> 08:25.020
- there could be other injuries.
- I'm gonna examine you, okay?

08:25.055 --> 08:27.122
BP's 150/90. It's pretty high.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.561
My head is what hurts. Not my foot.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.797
Ma'am, I need to make sure that you
don't have any hidden injuries

08:34.831 --> 08:35.864
that could possibly...

08:39.239 --> 08:41.239
_

08:41.504 --> 08:43.238
Do you know who this is?

08:43.273 --> 08:45.040
Is his name Jason?

08:46.009 --> 08:47.609
No. N-No, I don't.

08:49.312 --> 08:50.879
Should I?

Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

09:02.896 --> 09:05.356
What? I have a meeting.
Just 'cause it's my last day

09:05.356 --> 09:06.695
doesn't mean that I'm not busy.

09:06.729 --> 09:09.426
But, Captain, uh, since
this is your last shift,

09:09.460 --> 09:11.161
we had an idea.

09:11.195 --> 09:12.429
A-A way to celebrate.

09:12.463 --> 09:13.930
Oh, you want to celebrate my departure.

09:13.965 --> 09:16.333
Uh, more, we want to send you off right.

09:16.367 --> 09:17.734
A little "chapeau," if you will.

09:18.736 --> 09:21.538
It's a thing that we say
in the cycling world...

09:21.572 --> 09:23.506
a way to pass on congratulations.

09:23.541 --> 09:25.745
"Tip of the hat"
is the literal translation.

09:25.780 --> 09:27.984
Okay, whatever you're planning,
my answer is already no.

09:28.018 --> 09:30.547
Warren, check in on Gibson.
Make sure he's settling in.

09:30.581 --> 09:32.549
And, Montgomery, didn't I
already give you a job to do?

09:32.583 --> 09:34.766
Yes, and I finished it ages ago.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.520
Chapeau.

09:42.393 --> 09:44.527
This lac keeps bleeding
through... applying another 4x4.

09:47.565 --> 09:50.133
We're... We're stopping? Already?

09:50.167 --> 09:51.134
Don't worry.

09:51.168 --> 09:53.036
The doctors here at Grey-Sloan
are top notch.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.771
They'll sort everything out for you.

10:00.111 --> 10:02.212
No, no, no, wait no.
I don't want to be here.

10:02.246 --> 10:04.214
Okay, this is the hospital.
Just like you asked for.

10:04.248 --> 10:06.049
Female patient,
approximately 30 years old,

10:06.083 --> 10:07.918
discovered disoriented and
bleeding from a head wound...

10:07.952 --> 10:10.287
Wait. Please, no,
I don't want to be here.

10:10.321 --> 10:12.589
- It's okay.
- I know this is scary right now.

10:12.623 --> 10:14.408
No, you don't understand.
I can't... I have...

10:14.433 --> 10:16.108
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. I promise you,

10:16.109 --> 10:17.676
these doctors, they will help you.

10:17.711 --> 10:19.044
They will do everything they can.

10:19.079 --> 10:21.580
- Yeah, but I...
- Don't worry, okay?

10:24.384 --> 10:26.151
No. No, wait!

10:32.926 --> 10:35.770
- Hey.
- No, I told the Captain.

10:35.805 --> 10:37.062
I can handle batteries on my own.

10:37.097 --> 10:39.431
Actually, I wanted to pick your brain.

10:39.466 --> 10:43.368
About, you know, taking time
away from this place.

10:43.403 --> 10:46.071
I've been thinking about
shifting my focus a little.

10:46.106 --> 10:49.141
Maybe trying out, uh... dispatch?

10:49.175 --> 10:51.276
Time away bites.

10:51.311 --> 10:52.578
So does having a babysitter.

10:52.612 --> 10:54.079
Yeah, I'm... I'm not here...

10:54.114 --> 10:56.381
I'd really just like
to finish my work here, Warren.

10:56.416 --> 10:57.883
Tell the Captain I'm fine.

11:03.990 --> 11:05.591
Really? Captain sent you over, too?

11:05.625 --> 11:07.626
No, I sent me over. To chat.

11:07.660 --> 11:09.294
Because I have something to chat about.

11:09.329 --> 11:10.496
With you. My friend.

11:10.530 --> 11:14.166
So, you know my, um, "Mr. Hypothetical"?

11:14.200 --> 11:17.503
Well, things have progressed, and, uh...

11:17.537 --> 11:19.788
he told his sister about me.

11:20.673 --> 11:22.141
- Cool.
- Is it cool, though,

11:22.175 --> 11:23.709
or is it too much, too soon?

11:25.011 --> 11:26.578
So, not cool, then?

11:26.613 --> 11:27.746
No, you tell me. Which is it?

11:27.781 --> 11:29.681
Is it cool or not cool or... what?

11:29.716 --> 11:31.316
Depends, I guess.

11:32.886 --> 11:34.486
Okay, you know what.

11:34.521 --> 11:35.772
Thank you, Gibson. Thanks.

11:35.807 --> 11:37.756
- It was nothing.
- Yeah, you're right about that.

11:45.064 --> 11:46.698
Aren't you supposed to be at home today?

11:46.733 --> 11:49.001
Aren't you supposed
to be at your interview?

11:49.035 --> 11:50.435
Ooh, let's not talk about that.

11:50.470 --> 11:52.271
Ohh. I was gonna say,

11:52.305 --> 11:54.373
I would've pulled the fire alarm
for you if you wanted.

11:54.781 --> 11:56.208
Thank you.

11:56.242 --> 11:58.443
Everyone else seemed so excited about it

11:58.478 --> 11:59.845
when all I wanna do is...

11:59.879 --> 12:01.380
Hide under a rock?

12:03.249 --> 12:04.683
- Yeah.
- Mm.

12:04.717 --> 12:07.319
What's it been, uh, two weeks, no cane?

12:07.353 --> 12:09.555
Oh. Yep.

12:09.589 --> 12:10.989
Ready to be back.

12:11.024 --> 12:12.825
Meeting with Captain Herrera today...

12:12.859 --> 12:14.660
catching me up before I take over again.

12:15.134 --> 12:17.062
He's a little emotional

12:17.096 --> 12:19.364
about stepping down, so just...

12:19.399 --> 12:20.833
be prepared.

12:20.867 --> 12:23.135
Uh, well, maybe...

12:23.169 --> 12:25.003
you can pull the fire alarm for me then?

12:25.038 --> 12:27.005
I don't know if you know this, but...

12:27.040 --> 12:28.507
that's illegal.

12:35.281 --> 12:37.049
Hey! What are you d...

12:37.083 --> 12:38.417
Oh, damn.

12:38.451 --> 12:39.828
You weren't supposed to see me.

12:39.863 --> 12:41.911
Dad, what are you doing here?

12:43.423 --> 12:44.590
Get in.

12:44.624 --> 12:45.624
Okay.

12:47.227 --> 12:49.127
I thought you left months ago.

12:49.963 --> 12:51.496
I don't want you to get
in trouble or anything.

12:51.531 --> 12:52.865
You shouldn't be contacting me.

12:52.899 --> 12:54.666
I can't know anything
about where you are...

12:54.701 --> 12:56.551
I want to leave this with you.

12:58.104 --> 12:59.872
It goes to a storage unit downtown.

12:59.906 --> 13:01.806
I left something in there for you.

13:02.308 --> 13:04.576
I know you can't know
where I'm going next.

13:04.611 --> 13:06.845
I mean, hopefully someplace warm

13:06.880 --> 13:09.248
with a non-extradition treaty.

13:09.282 --> 13:10.565
Huh?

13:11.509 --> 13:12.976
Well...

13:14.587 --> 13:15.954
Anyway...

13:15.989 --> 13:17.923
So, um...

13:17.957 --> 13:19.291
this is it?

13:40.146 --> 13:42.581
All units, 1063,

13:42.615 --> 13:44.750
requesting immediate respons, over.

13:49.677 --> 13:52.366
Bishop's transfer to Station 23

13:52.367 --> 13:54.102
needs to be posted
other health conby next shift.

13:54.136 --> 13:56.097
- Okay.
- The Chief also wants a budget report

13:56.131 --> 13:57.805
by next Monday morning.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.113
Safety briefing,

13:59.694 --> 14:01.195
vehicle maintenance,

14:01.220 --> 14:02.785
citizen complaints.

14:02.810 --> 14:04.327
That reminds me.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.329
You seen Oscar?

14:07.423 --> 14:08.431
Oscar?

14:08.617 --> 14:09.617
Hm.

14:09.651 --> 14:10.785
Older guy?

14:10.819 --> 14:12.320
Had valve surgery about a year ago,

14:12.354 --> 14:15.289
didn't do the best job of
following his doctor's orders,

14:15.324 --> 14:16.348
so after the fifth time

14:16.382 --> 14:18.860
of answering his daughter's 911 calls...

14:18.861 --> 14:20.637
I had him come by here.

14:20.672 --> 14:22.373
- For?
- Checkups.

14:22.407 --> 14:23.874
I haven't seen him since I took over.

14:23.908 --> 14:25.075
Yeah, we get a lot of walk-ins.

14:25.110 --> 14:26.844
I really don't keep track.

14:26.878 --> 14:27.911
No. Of course you don't.

14:27.946 --> 14:29.852
What's that supposed to mean?

14:30.415 --> 14:31.815
It means you spend so much time

14:31.850 --> 14:33.751
checking people's uniforms at line up,

14:33.785 --> 14:35.886
you miss the details that matter.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.354
Like Oscar.

14:37.389 --> 14:40.057
Like Gibson's PTSD.

14:40.091 --> 14:41.425
That's not fair.

14:41.459 --> 14:43.093
You may think that
you're ready to be back,

14:43.128 --> 14:44.728
but I'm not ready to go...

14:44.763 --> 14:46.864
not until I know that you understand me.

14:46.898 --> 14:51.568
This job? It's bigger
than rules and discipline.

14:51.603 --> 14:53.370
You missed the warning signs with Gibson.

14:53.405 --> 14:54.705
You've never even heard of Oscar.

14:54.739 --> 14:57.574
But they are both a part
of your community now.

14:57.609 --> 15:01.378
So either you learn
how to look out for it...

15:02.781 --> 15:03.881
...or leave.

15:13.425 --> 15:15.459
You know, this place has been
different without you around.

15:15.493 --> 15:17.294
It smelled so much better.

15:17.328 --> 15:19.229
It'll be different
without you around, too.

15:19.264 --> 15:22.466
You know, uh, more pleasant.
Less mocking.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.967
You love my mocking.

15:24.002 --> 15:25.235
I do not.

15:30.275 --> 15:32.081
Okay. Enough.

15:32.610 --> 15:33.710
What?

15:33.745 --> 15:35.412
Enough of the silent treatment.

15:35.447 --> 15:37.047
You're pissed at me. Just say it.

15:37.082 --> 15:39.650
You don't say a word to me
at home. That's fine.

15:39.684 --> 15:41.652
I get the cold shoulder
plenty from my own family,

15:41.686 --> 15:44.088
but we can't be doing this at work, too.

15:44.122 --> 15:47.224
Where we actually need
to communicate to do our jobs.

15:47.258 --> 15:48.926
When we need to communicate...

15:48.960 --> 15:50.627
...we'll communicate.

15:50.662 --> 15:52.663
We need to communicate about this.

15:52.697 --> 15:54.765
I wasn't the only one
at that intervention.

15:54.799 --> 15:57.267
You could've talked to me one-on-one,

15:57.302 --> 15:59.269
you know, like friends sometimes do.

15:59.304 --> 16:01.105
Sometimes friends also
look out for each other.

16:01.139 --> 16:02.573
By not ambushing them!

16:02.607 --> 16:05.509
You didn't wanna hear it, man.

16:05.543 --> 16:06.844
There were things that you were facing

16:06.878 --> 16:07.954
that you didn't want to face.

16:07.989 --> 16:10.502
And that, actually, was the only way.

16:10.537 --> 16:11.815
I was trying to help you.

16:14.152 --> 16:15.452
All finished here.

16:18.623 --> 16:20.357
Aid Car 19.

16:20.391 --> 16:24.761
Civilian in distress
at 4841 Glenwood Avenue.

16:27.232 --> 16:28.632
Help you find something?

16:28.666 --> 16:31.368
Oh, yeah. You know this guy?

16:31.402 --> 16:32.703
Oscar.

16:32.737 --> 16:34.171
Wow, I haven't seen him in a while.

16:34.205 --> 16:35.672
How's he been?

16:35.707 --> 16:38.142
Well, that's a good question. Are you
familiar with his health issues?

16:38.176 --> 16:39.543
Uh, yeah, yeah.

16:39.577 --> 16:41.011
I went with Captain Herrera
on a few of his calls.

16:41.045 --> 16:42.613
All right, you're coming with me, then.

16:42.647 --> 16:44.615
- Where are we going exactly?
- House call.

16:44.649 --> 16:47.151
Hey, Gibson, join us. What do we got?

16:47.185 --> 16:48.719
We're gonna check up on a walk-in

16:48.753 --> 16:50.721
who hasn't walked in in a while.

16:50.755 --> 16:52.222
Three firefighters for a wellness check?

16:52.257 --> 16:53.257
Isn't that a bit overkill?

16:53.291 --> 16:54.819
Well, you haven't been
on any calls in a while.

16:54.853 --> 16:55.886
Me, either.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.461
Good way to dip our toes back in.

16:58.656 --> 17:00.390
All respect, sir, I don't need to dip.

17:00.415 --> 17:02.450
I don't want any special treatment.

17:02.475 --> 17:04.509
Warren, tell dispatch
we're taking the Engine.

17:18.383 --> 17:20.064
Pretty sure this is it.

17:20.919 --> 17:22.886
Mr. Delgado?

17:22.921 --> 17:25.694
This is Seattle FD, Station 19.

17:26.644 --> 17:27.944
It's open.

17:29.694 --> 17:31.595
The Huskies have been holding opponents

17:31.629 --> 17:34.097
to under 70 points a game this season.

17:34.132 --> 17:35.365
I said it was open.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.201
I didn't say you were welcome inside.

17:37.235 --> 17:38.235
What do you want?

17:38.269 --> 17:40.037
Afternoon.

17:40.071 --> 17:42.760
We're here to, um... to check on you.

17:42.794 --> 17:43.974
Captain Herrera noticed

17:44.008 --> 17:45.776
you hadn't been
to the station in a while.

17:45.810 --> 17:47.277
I'm glad you missed me.

17:47.312 --> 17:48.845
You can go now.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.514
Oscar, you can let us in now,

17:50.548 --> 17:52.382
or we can go back to Captain Herrera...

17:52.417 --> 17:54.098
tell him how you wouldn't let us in.

17:54.786 --> 17:56.787
And then he'd come here himself.

17:56.821 --> 17:58.555
Mm-hmm. And make an even bigger fuss.

17:58.590 --> 18:00.390
I mean, trust me, the guy
will stage an intervention

18:00.425 --> 18:01.856
in your living room.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.195
Fine.

18:05.230 --> 18:07.006
Knock yourself out.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.371
You know, when will people learn

18:14.405 --> 18:16.607
that nobody can really eat 50 eggs.

18:16.641 --> 18:17.941
Nobody.

18:21.679 --> 18:23.447
Isn't that our Jane Doe from earlier?

18:27.318 --> 18:28.585
Ma'am?

18:33.157 --> 18:34.758
Wait, wait!

18:34.792 --> 18:36.827
Stop! Stop!

18:43.680 --> 18:45.362
It's all right. You're okay.

18:45.387 --> 18:47.052
Do you know how you got here?

18:47.086 --> 18:48.339
Did someone bring you?

18:48.373 --> 18:49.487
I just...

18:50.076 --> 18:51.944
My head really hurts.

18:51.978 --> 18:53.841
There's no way Grey-Sloan
would release her like this.

18:53.866 --> 18:54.953
Well, maybe she asked for a transfer.

18:54.988 --> 18:56.134
She could be a patient here now.

18:56.168 --> 18:57.235
Will you come with us?

18:57.269 --> 18:59.604
Just right here to our Aid Car?
We'll check you out.

18:59.638 --> 19:00.605
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Come on.

19:00.639 --> 19:01.973
- It's okay.
- Yeah, come on.

19:06.378 --> 19:08.627
I'll call Grey-Sloan, see what happened.

19:08.661 --> 19:09.781
I'll check inside.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.149
See if anyone saw her
getting dropped off.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.488
So, uh, you have a cold?

19:16.522 --> 19:18.890
Uh, it's just some gunk in my chest.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.482
Makes it hard to breathe sometimes.

19:21.516 --> 19:23.161
I have to order some more.

19:23.195 --> 19:24.729
You can find that at any pharmacy.

19:24.763 --> 19:27.665
Car's busted. And my daughter just moved.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.043
I see you haven't played chess
in a while, huh.

19:30.078 --> 19:32.637
- Now I remember you.
- You do?

19:32.671 --> 19:34.339
Last time I stopped by the station?

19:34.373 --> 19:37.242
You're the hard-ass
that was drilling the crew.

19:37.276 --> 19:40.578
Needless to say, I, um,
just kept on walking.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.847
94.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.350
You mind leaning forward for me?

19:45.384 --> 19:46.885
Have you had any other symptoms?

19:46.919 --> 19:48.319
Fatigue, chest pain?

19:48.354 --> 19:50.388
I get a little bit dizzy sometimes.

19:50.422 --> 19:52.190
I don't want to move around too much.

19:52.224 --> 19:54.135
Just been camped out on the couch.

19:55.007 --> 19:56.241
Resps are high.

19:58.230 --> 20:00.231
- Let me see the stethoscope.
- I just said resps are high.

20:00.266 --> 20:02.267
Yeah, I'm not checking his breathing.

20:02.301 --> 20:04.602
I think I let you guys bother me enough.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.204
Uh, how about we wrap this up?

20:10.142 --> 20:12.443
Regurg. His valve's not working.

20:12.478 --> 20:13.761
We need to call an Aid Car. Now.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.041
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:15.075 --> 20:16.714
I got a Huskies game to watch.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.082
I told you boys,

20:18.117 --> 20:19.350
I'm not getting in any ambulance.

20:19.385 --> 20:20.919
Wait, wait. No...

20:20.953 --> 20:22.954
- And I am not going to any hospital!
- Why don't you sit down?

20:22.988 --> 20:25.390
- Oscar.
- I-I-It's time for you to go!

20:26.659 --> 20:28.293
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Slow, slow, slow, slow.

20:28.327 --> 20:29.527
Gibson, call it in.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.363
I'm not sure what you're asking me...

20:32.398 --> 20:34.265
Yeah, but, we're not cops,

20:34.300 --> 20:36.761
so you... you... you just want us to...

20:37.636 --> 20:39.237
Okay, okay.

20:39.271 --> 20:41.739
And how long do you think that will be?

20:41.774 --> 20:43.575
He's showing signs
of congestive heart failure.

20:43.609 --> 20:47.445
Fluid in his lungs.
He could develop a clot or P.E.

20:49.348 --> 20:50.882
Maybe we should just take him
to the hospital in the Engine?

20:50.916 --> 20:54.085
If he codes en route, we have
no way to work on him.

20:54.119 --> 20:55.486
We gotta find a way to buy some time

20:55.521 --> 20:56.788
until the Aid Car gets here.

20:59.024 --> 21:01.759
Guys. Giving fluids.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.595
- And push dopamine.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

21:03.629 --> 21:05.430
- Do not!
- We gotta increase his BP...

21:05.464 --> 21:06.664
move the fluid out of his lungs.

21:06.699 --> 21:09.133
No, his valve's already weak. If
we push too much, it could blow.

21:11.397 --> 21:12.997
Am I gonna be okay?

21:13.022 --> 21:14.322
I was hoping to visit my daughter.

21:14.506 --> 21:16.341
We'll get you there. Won't we?

21:19.178 --> 21:20.411
Let's get him on a monitor.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.264
Ready the dopamine.

21:23.148 --> 21:25.183
We will push it a little at a time

21:25.217 --> 21:26.784
and keep him stable throughout.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.289
While these guys earn their keep,

21:31.323 --> 21:32.924
wanna play some chess?

21:32.958 --> 21:35.426
Do I look like I can
sashay over to the table?

21:36.895 --> 21:39.030
Can't we... Can't we play in our heads?

21:42.167 --> 21:43.801
All right.

21:46.472 --> 21:48.473
White pawn,

21:48.507 --> 21:51.209
E2 to E4.

21:51.243 --> 21:52.710
Pushing dopamine.

21:56.215 --> 21:58.216
So far, all good.

21:58.250 --> 22:01.052
Black pawn to...

22:01.086 --> 22:02.353
F5.

22:03.422 --> 22:05.356
Queen to F3.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.360
You as dumb as a fire hydrant,
you know that?

22:09.395 --> 22:11.062
Easy, Oscar...

22:11.096 --> 22:12.130
easy...

22:12.164 --> 22:13.998
Pushing again.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.400
Holding steady.

22:15.434 --> 22:18.836
I said Queen to F3.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.614
Let's go, baldie.

22:21.373 --> 22:24.042
Uh, pawn to...

22:24.076 --> 22:25.076
G5.

22:25.110 --> 22:26.444
Pushing again.

22:27.513 --> 22:28.880
Stop! Stop.

22:28.914 --> 22:30.782
BP's crashing.

22:32.284 --> 22:33.751
How you doing, Oscar? It's okay.

22:33.786 --> 22:34.859
Just stay calm.

22:34.894 --> 22:37.689
- Focus on me.
- Queen...

22:38.791 --> 22:40.491
Oscar. Oscar!

22:40.526 --> 22:41.559
Push the rest of that dopamine.

22:41.593 --> 22:44.529
No, we need to play this just...

22:44.563 --> 22:45.763
right.

22:45.798 --> 22:48.232
Not too fast. Not too slow.

22:48.267 --> 22:49.901
Perfect balance.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.578
BP's normalizing.

23:03.449 --> 23:05.183
Help is here, Oscar.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.452
They'll have you
at the hospital in no time.

23:07.486 --> 23:09.496
Well, in that case,

23:10.322 --> 23:12.256
Queen to H5.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.193
Checkmate.

23:18.297 --> 23:20.298
I don't understand. I have a head injury.

23:20.332 --> 23:21.365
I should see a doctor.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.434
We have to take you through intake first.

23:23.469 --> 23:25.803
Hospitals are sticklers about protocol.

23:25.838 --> 23:26.839
Once we get the right
info from Grey-Sloan...

23:26.864 --> 23:27.865
Andy?

23:28.474 --> 23:31.476
It's been a while since
we did a-a neuro check.

23:31.510 --> 23:32.744
Why don't I take a look?

23:32.778 --> 23:34.112
Uh, okay.

23:36.148 --> 23:37.248
What's... What's going on?

23:37.282 --> 23:39.784
- We can't let her leave this hospital.
- Yeah, I know,

23:39.818 --> 23:42.153
but this time we need her to
actually stay in the hospital.

23:42.187 --> 23:44.455
Andy, I just got off the phone
with Grey-Sloan.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.991
She ran away as soon
as we dropped her off.

23:47.025 --> 23:49.460
Apparently, she's a fugitive.

23:49.495 --> 23:51.095
She was being sentenced
in court this morning,

23:51.130 --> 23:52.730
and she escaped. She's been lying to us.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.166
No, no, she... she doesn't
know who she is.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.068
She came to us, remember?

23:57.102 --> 23:59.137
She knows exactly who she is.

23:59.171 --> 24:01.272
She's been playing us this entire time.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.980
Her real name's Margaret Chen.
And this whole amnesia thing,

24:10.981 --> 24:12.115
her story, it's an act.

24:12.149 --> 24:13.383
But how'd she get injured, then?

24:13.417 --> 24:14.617
I mean, that head lac is real.

24:14.651 --> 24:16.486
And superficial, easily self-inflicted.

24:16.520 --> 24:19.222
But why? If she's on the run,
why seek us out?

24:19.256 --> 24:21.860
- Unless she needs something from us.
- We can't arrest her.

24:23.384 --> 24:25.364
They said we have to keep
her here until PD arrives.

24:26.330 --> 24:28.131
I'll just check your pulse.

24:28.165 --> 24:30.400
Neuro check is normal
and bleeding's stopped.

24:30.434 --> 24:31.780
Can I go inside now?

24:31.815 --> 24:33.436
Why? You didn't seem so anxious

24:33.470 --> 24:34.937
to go inside the last hospital.

24:34.972 --> 24:37.440
I'm hurting, and I-I don't know
who I am, and I...

24:37.474 --> 24:39.175
No, no, Margaret.

24:39.209 --> 24:41.344
- Tell me the real reason.
- I just...

24:41.378 --> 24:44.091
My head really hurts.
That is the real reaso...

24:49.820 --> 24:51.265
Let's just stay calm.

24:52.723 --> 24:53.990
Please.

24:54.024 --> 24:55.491
Please don't turn me in. Please.

24:55.526 --> 24:57.326
Not yet. I-I'll go back.

24:57.361 --> 24:59.495
I-I wasn't really trying to run.

24:59.530 --> 25:02.163
Just... an hour. I just needed an hour.
Please.

25:02.197 --> 25:04.634
The cops will have to
handle it from here.

25:04.668 --> 25:06.972
Jason. The little boy,
the photo in my shoe?

25:07.006 --> 25:08.671
That's Jason. He's my son.

25:08.705 --> 25:12.275
He's only 8 1/2 years old
and just the sweetest kid.

25:12.309 --> 25:14.179
You don't understand. I have to see him,

25:14.204 --> 25:15.611
please.

25:24.087 --> 25:25.621
I'm not crazy, I swear.

25:25.656 --> 25:27.390
I know it seems that way, but I'm not.

25:27.424 --> 25:29.708
Andy, I need to process her
and take her in.

25:29.742 --> 25:32.096
Margaret, tell Ryan what you told me.

25:33.664 --> 25:36.332
I was desperate.
Ever since Jason was born,

25:36.366 --> 25:38.134
he suffered from spells and seizures.

25:38.168 --> 25:39.735
My insurance wouldn't cover all his meds,

25:39.770 --> 25:42.138
so I borrowed a little money
from my company.

25:42.172 --> 25:44.574
I was gonna pay it back
before anybody noticed.

25:44.608 --> 25:45.875
I got caught.

25:45.909 --> 25:48.177
And now Jason's operation is today.

25:48.212 --> 25:51.241
My sister's been
taking care of him, but...

25:52.082 --> 25:54.745
there's a really big chance
he won't make it off the table.

25:55.752 --> 25:58.754
I, uh... I'll do my time.

25:58.789 --> 26:00.523
But Jason...

26:00.557 --> 26:04.694
He keeps asking if he'll get
to see me before surgery.

26:04.728 --> 26:07.330
He's scared.

26:07.364 --> 26:10.766
He's scared he'll die
without seeing me again.

26:10.801 --> 26:13.436
So am I.

26:13.470 --> 26:16.439
Can't we figure out a way
to get her in there?

26:16.473 --> 26:18.341
Even for a couple minutes
to go see her kid?

26:18.375 --> 26:19.609
We're not even sure her story's true.

26:19.643 --> 26:21.444
It's easy enough to verify.

26:21.478 --> 26:23.546
Andy, this is my job. There are rules.

26:23.580 --> 26:25.014
Then bend them.

26:25.048 --> 26:26.549
She just wants to see her kid.

26:26.583 --> 26:29.118
She's only asking
for a few extra minutes.

26:29.152 --> 26:30.753
We can do that for her.

26:30.787 --> 26:32.955
All you have to do is escort her
into the hospital.

26:32.990 --> 26:35.391
And then what? What if she runs?

26:35.425 --> 26:37.727
I won't. I swear I won't.

26:37.761 --> 26:39.595
They wouldn't let me out.

26:39.630 --> 26:41.041
He's too sick to come see me.

26:41.076 --> 26:44.567
I didn't plan on running today,
but when I saw the chance...

26:44.601 --> 26:46.969
I just want to see my little boy again.

26:47.004 --> 26:50.008
Please let me say goodbye.

26:50.674 --> 26:52.074
Whatever you're deciding,

26:52.109 --> 26:53.279
decide it quickly.

26:53.313 --> 26:55.411
Two more squad cars are heading this way.

27:16.133 --> 27:17.166
What are y... What are you doing?

27:17.200 --> 27:18.521
I tried talking to not you

27:18.556 --> 27:19.728
and that, literally,
could not have gone worse.

27:19.763 --> 27:22.605
So, now, I'm here
supporting your biking...

27:22.639 --> 27:25.274
- Cycling.
- Supporting your biking

27:25.309 --> 27:26.779
because I need to talk to you.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.131
Specifically...
Specifically you about my thing.

27:30.881 --> 27:33.015
Oh, my God, how do you do this for fun?

27:33.050 --> 27:35.220
It's easier once you find your c-spot.

27:36.620 --> 27:38.035
No, I'm not even gonna touch that.

27:38.069 --> 27:39.516
I am seeing someone.

27:41.291 --> 27:43.225
- Oh?
- Yes.

27:43.259 --> 27:44.994
And it's complicated.

27:45.028 --> 27:46.696
And if I tell you more,
that means it means something,

27:46.730 --> 27:49.432
and I don't know if I'm ready
for it to mean anything yet.

27:49.466 --> 27:52.101
But... And it means
something to him, apparently,

27:52.135 --> 27:53.923
so I wanted to talk to you

27:53.957 --> 27:55.671
about whether or not
I should talk to you about it.

27:56.224 --> 27:57.281
- Hey.
- I'm just...

27:57.843 --> 27:59.606
Either of you seen Captain Herrera?

27:59.607 --> 28:01.975
No. No, not... No, what?

28:02.009 --> 28:05.512
No, I've never... I've never
seen Captain Herrera before.

28:05.546 --> 28:07.030
I was hoping to meet up with Bishop,

28:07.090 --> 28:08.557
but she got called away.

28:08.591 --> 28:11.026
I had no idea you were into cycling.

28:11.060 --> 28:12.060
N... No.

28:12.095 --> 28:13.495
Oh, oh, oh, hey.

28:13.529 --> 28:15.263
You good?

28:15.298 --> 28:17.232
Yeah.

28:17.266 --> 28:19.668
You know, uh, maybe check
the Beanery for Captain Herrera.

28:19.702 --> 28:21.683
Yeah. Will do. Thanks.

28:25.141 --> 28:26.808
You're dating the Chief?!

28:32.982 --> 28:35.417
I guess you'll be wanting a rematch?

28:35.451 --> 28:38.353
You can come by the station anytime.

28:38.388 --> 28:40.722
Well, if it'll keep you schmucks
out of my apartment,

28:40.757 --> 28:43.025
you have my word.

28:43.059 --> 28:44.693
Uh, good.

28:44.727 --> 28:46.595
Here's my personal number.

28:51.854 --> 28:54.056
You're not so bad after all, baldie.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.123
How's he gonna make it to the station

29:02.148 --> 29:03.849
if his car doesn't work?

29:14.323 --> 29:15.791
Eh, from the looks of this lemon...

29:15.825 --> 29:17.993
we are going way beyond the call of duty.

29:18.027 --> 29:19.705
Nothing you haven't done before, right?

29:19.739 --> 29:21.463
In fact, I just watched you do it.

29:22.799 --> 29:24.143
Thanks.

29:24.178 --> 29:26.134
Maybe it's the transmission?

29:28.588 --> 29:29.771
Maybe not.

29:29.806 --> 29:31.106
Sounds more like a loose hose.

29:35.324 --> 29:37.191
The V-belt needs tightening, too.

29:37.216 --> 29:39.177
Things sure changed while I was gone.

29:40.650 --> 29:43.585
- How so?
- I mean, look at you guys.

29:43.619 --> 29:46.121
We got a former surgeon
turned car mechanic

29:46.155 --> 29:48.890
and a Captain who's actually
getting his hands dirty.

29:51.461 --> 29:53.567
And Pruitt's on his way out,

29:54.230 --> 29:56.528
Maya's getting transferred
to another station altogether.

29:58.568 --> 30:01.336
Hope 19 doesn't wind up like this junker.

30:01.370 --> 30:02.868
Well...

30:03.506 --> 30:05.107
we'll keep her rolling.

30:07.737 --> 30:08.837
Try again.

30:11.681 --> 30:13.815
There you go!

30:17.820 --> 30:20.110
Ms. Chen was here in the ambulance bay...

30:20.111 --> 30:21.912
You're sure it's the same woman
you treated this morning?

30:21.946 --> 30:24.340
I wasn't sure at first, but
then I realized it was her.

30:24.374 --> 30:26.049
You should know, she suffered a minor

30:26.084 --> 30:27.751
but potentially concerning injury.

30:27.785 --> 30:29.920
We didn't realize it was
self-inflicted at the time.

30:29.954 --> 30:31.555
I mean, she couldn't have gotten far.

30:31.589 --> 30:32.890
There are so many places
to hide out here.

30:32.924 --> 30:35.959
She's probably right
in front of our faces.

30:35.994 --> 30:37.561
Units 13 and 25,

30:37.595 --> 30:38.829
fan out and search.

30:38.863 --> 30:40.998
Suspect is unarmed, non-violent.

30:41.032 --> 30:42.699
No need to alarm too many people yet.

30:44.936 --> 30:47.083
At least I won't be transferring
to 23 anymore.

30:47.117 --> 30:48.075
You won't?

30:48.109 --> 30:49.339
Instead, I'll be going to jail.

30:49.374 --> 30:51.909
- For harboring a fugitive.
- Ah, less is more.

30:51.943 --> 30:54.611
Just don't answer questions
that they don't ask.

30:54.646 --> 30:56.580
Mind helping us look around out here?

30:56.614 --> 30:58.815
Help you look around? Out here?

31:00.184 --> 31:01.485
Sure thing.

31:04.689 --> 31:05.923
Yeah.

31:15.967 --> 31:18.135
- You don't have much time.
- I know.

31:19.537 --> 31:20.704
I'll be close by.

31:28.012 --> 31:30.047
Mom?!

31:30.081 --> 31:31.448
How'd you get here?

31:37.388 --> 31:40.390
They said you couldn't come.

31:40.425 --> 31:43.026
All that matters is I'm here now.

31:44.062 --> 31:46.221
I love you forever.

31:47.098 --> 31:48.966
I love you, too, Mom.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.001
Forever plus 1,000.

31:57.408 --> 31:58.475
Hi, Jason.

32:00.611 --> 32:02.145
It's time to go in now.

32:02.180 --> 32:03.747
Be brave, okay?

32:33.111 --> 32:34.177
I'm ready.

32:40.952 --> 32:43.587
She received additional
treatment at Grey-Sloan.

32:43.621 --> 32:45.022
I don't have details.

32:45.056 --> 32:46.590
I think you've given us
everything you can.

32:46.624 --> 32:48.392
We'll take it from here.

32:48.426 --> 32:50.460
Negative on our perimeter
search... head inside.

32:50.495 --> 32:52.095
Oh, y-you're going in?

33:41.394 --> 33:42.761
Lieutenant.

33:44.200 --> 33:45.364
What can I do for you?

33:45.398 --> 33:50.120
Chief, I'd like to keep
Bishop on at Station 19.

33:50.120 --> 33:52.722
Is there a problem
with Gibson or Herrera?

33:52.756 --> 33:55.141
Not at all. I want all three of them.

33:55.759 --> 33:57.360
Bishop's needed at 23.

33:57.394 --> 33:59.729
Not as badly as she's needed here.

33:59.763 --> 34:02.431
The fact is, every single
woman and man at 19

34:02.466 --> 34:04.533
plays a critical role...

34:04.568 --> 34:07.320
not just for the station,
but the city we serve.

34:07.871 --> 34:09.672
This is a family.

34:09.706 --> 34:12.041
And it's my job to keep them together.

34:15.612 --> 34:17.013
You sound like Pruitt.

34:18.949 --> 34:20.583
Thank you, sir.

34:25.621 --> 34:26.889
Very well.

34:26.924 --> 34:28.257
Request approved.

34:29.326 --> 34:30.860
- Sir, I just wanted t...
- Let's go...

34:38.835 --> 34:39.936
Thank you.

34:41.938 --> 34:43.123
- Yeah.
- Right.

34:44.975 --> 34:46.775
This thing starting yet?

34:46.810 --> 34:48.177
Soon, I think.

34:51.014 --> 34:54.951
My hobbies aren't
distractions... exactly.

34:55.319 --> 34:57.954
Cycling, all of it, it's just...

34:58.634 --> 35:00.556
I don't know. I realized
after the breakup,

35:00.590 --> 35:03.492
all I really have is this job and...

35:03.527 --> 35:04.961
Michael.

35:04.995 --> 35:06.529
Michael?

35:07.698 --> 35:10.833
Yeah, I think I'm still really
hung up on my dead husband.

35:13.670 --> 35:15.312
Well, I haven't lost a husband,

35:15.346 --> 35:18.558
so I can't exactly speak to that, but...

35:19.843 --> 35:21.344
...from what you've told me,

35:21.378 --> 35:23.946
of course you're still hung up.
Michael sounds amazing.

35:24.781 --> 35:27.016
Don't be too hard on yourself.

35:27.050 --> 35:28.417
Seems like the kind of
thing that's just gonna

35:28.452 --> 35:30.152
take the time it's gonna take, right?

35:33.890 --> 35:36.759
So, this...

35:36.793 --> 35:38.260
new hobby of yours.

35:38.295 --> 35:40.696
Uh... Uh...

35:40.731 --> 35:42.499
You seem pretty into it.

35:43.333 --> 35:46.168
I'm definitely getting there.

35:46.203 --> 35:47.970
As much as I'm into cycling?

35:48.005 --> 35:49.071
Oh, am I into my new hobby enough

35:49.106 --> 35:52.375
to wear a spandex bodysuit
and helmet in public for it?

35:52.409 --> 35:54.477
Sadly... yes,

35:54.511 --> 35:56.479
I think I am.

35:56.513 --> 35:58.647
Okay, can we talk about

35:58.682 --> 36:00.634
- how hot your hobby is, by the way?
- Oh, God, thank you!

36:00.668 --> 36:02.051
Thank you! Thank you.

36:02.085 --> 36:03.619
God, somebody who gets it.

36:03.653 --> 36:05.988
- Gibson gives me none of this.
- Jack knew before me?!

36:06.023 --> 36:07.990
Come on!

36:11.161 --> 36:12.754
Heard you saved the day.

36:12.779 --> 36:14.946
Yep. It was, uh...

36:15.232 --> 36:17.166
It was a great call.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.168
I also heard that you're thinking about

36:19.202 --> 36:21.037
hanging up your fire helmet.

36:23.740 --> 36:24.707
Okay, uh...

36:24.741 --> 36:28.010
I know you went out on a limb
to hire me, sir.

36:28.045 --> 36:29.979
I-It's not that I want
to leave firefighting.

36:30.013 --> 36:33.682
I-I love saving people, the rush,

36:33.717 --> 36:35.151
b-being the first on the scene.

36:36.353 --> 36:37.987
But I love Miranda more,

36:38.021 --> 36:40.556
and I'm worried about
what I'm doing to her.

36:42.926 --> 36:45.061
Well, you have a very unique
set of skills...

36:45.095 --> 36:46.996
your medical expertise,

36:47.030 --> 36:48.898
your... years of experience

36:48.932 --> 36:51.167
that you've honed over your career.

36:51.201 --> 36:54.571
So, I should just go back to medicine?

36:55.939 --> 36:57.940
It's... really hard

36:57.974 --> 37:00.118
to walk away from firefighting.

37:02.112 --> 37:04.246
Have you ever thought about Medic One?

37:06.149 --> 37:07.450
Well, that's...

37:07.484 --> 37:09.118
I mean...

37:09.152 --> 37:10.837
They're the elite of the elite.

37:12.589 --> 37:14.523
You think I'd be good for that?

37:14.558 --> 37:15.925
I know you would.

37:22.165 --> 37:24.266
Catwalk. Two minutes.

37:24.301 --> 37:25.643
Dean.

37:26.136 --> 37:27.470
Hang on a second.

37:27.504 --> 37:29.972
Ah, he speaks.

37:30.006 --> 37:32.041
The intervention. You, uh...

37:32.075 --> 37:33.976
You came to me because
I wasn't coming to you.

37:34.010 --> 37:36.445
I-I do get that.

37:36.480 --> 37:39.415
I needed help, and
I didn't want to hear it,

37:39.449 --> 37:43.119
so you found a way to make me listen.

37:43.153 --> 37:44.487
That's right.

37:44.521 --> 37:47.373
Your folks, they're, uh,
still not talking to you?

37:48.158 --> 37:50.493
I called them, but they can't
be bothered to call me, so...

37:50.527 --> 37:53.062
It's funny 'cause they talked to me.

37:54.598 --> 37:55.564
You called my family?

37:55.599 --> 37:58.100
Yeah, I invited them over
for dinner next week.

37:58.135 --> 38:00.236
- At our place.
- Why would you do that?

38:00.270 --> 38:01.937
They weren't hearing you out,

38:01.972 --> 38:04.874
so I, uh, found a way
to make them listen.

38:05.809 --> 38:07.386
Consider this me, uh,
returning the favor.

38:15.218 --> 38:16.051
Hello.

38:16.086 --> 38:18.854
I, uh, got an update from the hospital.

38:18.889 --> 38:20.156
Margaret's son pulled through.

38:20.190 --> 38:22.191
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Yeah.

38:22.225 --> 38:24.460
That's... Wow.

38:24.494 --> 38:26.929
I also wanted to say, um...

38:26.963 --> 38:29.031
you were right this morning.

38:29.065 --> 38:32.168
We don't need to get too worried
about rules or anything.

38:32.202 --> 38:35.204
Yes. Exactly.

38:35.238 --> 38:37.306
- See? Way more fun.
- Yeah, sure.

38:37.340 --> 38:39.041
We'll just keep it fun,

38:39.075 --> 38:41.677
no attachments, no restrictions.

38:41.711 --> 38:43.712
Mm-hmm. Do what we want,
go where we want...

38:43.747 --> 38:45.014
See who we want.

38:46.750 --> 38:49.602
You mean, like other people?

38:50.687 --> 38:52.721
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

38:52.756 --> 38:54.857
Like you said... no attachments.

38:54.891 --> 38:56.358
If that's what you want.

38:56.393 --> 38:59.128
If that's what... you want.

39:02.403 --> 39:03.799
Dad.

39:03.833 --> 39:05.334
I need you for something.

39:07.871 --> 39:10.506
Andrea, I really
don't have time for this.

39:10.540 --> 39:12.074
Oh, yes, you do. Trust me.

39:14.177 --> 39:16.212
- What's this all about?
- I think you know.

39:18.748 --> 39:20.816
Pole days have to be earned.

39:20.850 --> 39:23.185
- You did earn one, sir.
- Oh, come on,

39:23.220 --> 39:25.321
- It's your last day.
- It's okay to break

39:25.355 --> 39:27.156
your own rules every now and then.

39:29.793 --> 39:30.759
Not a chance.

39:30.794 --> 39:32.161
You haven't lived
until you've gone down that.

39:32.195 --> 39:33.429
- Come on!
- Do it, Cap. -Come on!

39:33.463 --> 39:34.563
Four months of this badgering,

39:34.598 --> 39:37.062
you would think I'd be looking for
the quickest way out of this place.

39:37.096 --> 39:38.234
Oh.

39:39.236 --> 39:41.003
What's that?

39:41.037 --> 39:43.038
There it is!

39:47.310 --> 39:48.677
What do you think you're doing?

39:48.712 --> 39:50.479
Oh, if one goes, we all go.

39:51.715 --> 39:53.082
Good first day back?

39:53.116 --> 39:55.251
You know, I'm kind of glad
you're going to 23.

39:55.285 --> 39:57.786
You, uh, can't keep checking up
on me from across town.

39:57.821 --> 39:59.188
Oh.

39:59.222 --> 40:01.051
Bad news for you, Gibson.

40:01.085 --> 40:02.558
What?

40:02.592 --> 40:03.993
What do you mean bad news?

40:04.961 --> 40:07.463
Oh, hey, you think
I'd be good for Medic One?

40:08.665 --> 40:09.898
Good luck, man.

40:09.933 --> 40:11.062
Medic One is hard.

40:11.096 --> 40:12.601
I don't know anybody
who's gotten through it.

40:15.272 --> 40:17.473
All of us struggle with our identity.

40:17.507 --> 40:19.908
Whoo!

40:19.943 --> 40:22.311
Told my best friend about us today.

40:22.345 --> 40:24.380
- Pruitt knows?
- What?

40:24.414 --> 40:26.148
Oh, funny. You're funny.

40:26.182 --> 40:27.149
No, I know you know better

40:27.183 --> 40:29.369
than to actually tell anyone
in the department.

40:29.986 --> 40:31.787
I think I'll have a go.
It's been a while.

40:35.859 --> 40:37.593
Maybe we date someone we shouldn't.

40:39.996 --> 40:42.229
Maybe we're related
to someone we wish we weren'.

40:55.402 --> 40:56.979
Use for the mortgage.

40:57.013 --> 40:58.180
For your mom.

40:58.214 --> 41:00.182
It's clean, I promise.

41:11.027 --> 41:12.928
Maybe we need rules.

41:12.962 --> 41:14.363
Maybe we shun them.

41:16.066 --> 41:18.200
Maybe we need to shake off
who we always thought we were

41:18.234 --> 41:19.635
and try on something new.

41:19.669 --> 41:21.337
Today surprised me.

41:21.371 --> 41:23.872
I expected "blah."

41:23.907 --> 41:26.208
But actually, I...

41:26.242 --> 41:28.277
I made a real difference
for someone today.

41:30.380 --> 41:34.016
And it turned out to be a great outcome.

41:34.050 --> 41:36.018
- I'm glad.
- Me, too.

41:37.654 --> 41:39.722
You know, I had a pretty good day, too.

41:39.756 --> 41:43.359
Yeah, we saved, uh, a patient
with congestive heart failure,

41:43.393 --> 41:45.160
and we got his car to start.

41:45.195 --> 41:46.921
Hm, I treated a fugitive

41:46.946 --> 41:48.063
- with fake amnesia...
- Oh...

41:48.098 --> 41:50.165
...and lied to a few cops

41:50.200 --> 41:51.926
- so she could say goodbye to her son.
- Hm.

41:52.535 --> 41:54.002
You know this isn't a competition, right?

41:54.037 --> 41:56.004
Mm...

41:56.039 --> 41:57.339
It kind of is.

41:57.374 --> 41:58.841
Maybe we should loosen up.

41:58.875 --> 42:00.976
Maybe we should take a leap.

42:01.010 --> 42:03.178
Because when we do, maybe...

42:03.213 --> 42:04.236
Dad?

42:04.270 --> 42:06.215
One more time couldn't hurt, right?

42:06.249 --> 42:08.317
...we just might surprise ourselves.
