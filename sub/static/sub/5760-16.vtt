<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

00:12.672 --> 00:15.632
I just got married,
just moved to a small town,

00:15.633 --> 00:17.634
<i>just opened up an antique shop.</i>

00:17.635 --> 00:20.135
I might be just like you.

00:20.472 --> 00:22.598
Except from the time
that I was a little girl,

00:22.599 --> 00:25.434
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

00:25.435 --> 00:26.810
It's all right, honey.

00:26.811 --> 00:29.354
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them,

00:29.355 --> 00:30.856
<i>the ones who have not crossed over</i>

00:30.857 --> 00:32.983
<i>because they have
unfinished business with the living.</i>

00:32.984 --> 00:35.704
<i>And they come to me for help.</i>

00:35.904 --> 00:40.424
To tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

<i>As morning light"s intensity dims,
the temperature drops</i>

01:39.216 --> 01:42.096
<i>and the wind rips at your body.</i>

01:45.139 --> 01:48.266
<i>Put aside your fears,
ignoring your aching muscles,</i>

01:48.267 --> 01:52.562
<i>and psyche yourself up for
the final four hour push to the top.</i>

01:52.563 --> 01:55.315

01:55.316 --> 01:59.706

And now, faced...</i>

02:33.395 --> 02:35.646
- What?
- It's Andrea.

02:35.647 --> 02:39.483
Melinda, hi.
Look, I'm sorry to call you this late,

02:39.484 --> 02:42.236
but there is something
very wrong going on over here.

02:42.237 --> 02:43.446
What?

02:43.447 --> 02:44.864
<i>Some very weird stuff,</i>

02:44.865 --> 02:47.658
and I wouldn't have bothered you
if I could have figured it out myself.

02:47.659 --> 02:49.326
<i>At this height,
innocent mistaKes can Kill.</i>

<i>If ropes become tangled,
it can taKe hours to untangle them,</i>

02:54.166 --> 02:56.000
<i>hours of wasted time.</i>

02:56.001 --> 02:59.171
<i>Each foothold could be your last.</i>

02:59.462 --> 03:01.962
- Melinda.
- Hello?

03:03.216 --> 03:05.716
Hello?

03:07.721 --> 03:10.221
<i>Can you see us?</i>

03:33.288 --> 03:36.291
GHOST WHISPERER

03:43.656 --> 03:45.198
I don't see anybody here.

03:45.199 --> 03:47.534
Well, something was here, trust me.

03:47.535 --> 03:49.369
All right, tell me everything
that you did tonight.

03:49.370 --> 03:51.413
All right. After we closed,

03:51.414 --> 03:53.289
I exercised for an hour and a half,
ate a salad,

03:53.290 --> 03:56.960
and read the new Stephen Hawking
book until I fell asleep.

03:56.961 --> 04:00.213
<i>Fine, I ate a pint of
Cherry Garcia and watched Survivor.</i>

04:00.214 --> 04:02.132
Maybe you're being haunted
by your conscience.

04:02.133 --> 04:05.760
Seriously, Melinda,
this thing scared the hell out of me.

04:05.761 --> 04:07.971
You're used to this stuff, but I'm not.

04:07.972 --> 04:10.390
Did anybody else
in the building feel anything?

04:10.391 --> 04:12.100
Not that I've heard.

04:12.101 --> 04:14.269
Has anything weird
ever happened here before

04:14.270 --> 04:16.646
even though it didn't
feel like it at the time?

04:16.647 --> 04:19.399
The water takes five minutes
to get hot. Does that count?

04:19.399 --> 04:22.230
Five minutes? You are so lucky.

04:22.820 --> 04:25.738
Well, is there any chance
this could be just like a random thing,

04:25.739 --> 04:27.782
like a drive-by haunting?

04:27.783 --> 04:29.909
No. These things
are almost never random.

04:29.910 --> 04:31.661
And if the place wasn't haunted
to begin with,

04:31.662 --> 04:33.830
probably means that you brought
something home with you somehow.

04:33.831 --> 04:35.498
Great. A take-out ghost.

04:35.499 --> 04:38.829
Don't worry. We'll get through this.

04:39.545 --> 04:42.425
Do you have any more ice cream?

04:49.721 --> 04:51.430
Thanks. Yeah, okay.

04:51.431 --> 04:53.931
Hey. How you doing? Tired?

04:54.476 --> 04:57.066
No, not really. I'm, just...

04:57.104 --> 04:59.939
I have this kind of sense of dread.

04:59.940 --> 05:01.399
You know,
like someone's watching me.

05:01.400 --> 05:05.319
Then it goes away and I feel fine.
I'm kind of freaked out.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.948
Hey. Don't worry, okay?

05:08.448 --> 05:10.948
Okay. Thanks.

05:30.804 --> 05:33.764
Are you all right? Are you okay?

05:36.017 --> 05:37.309
OPEN - WILL RETURN

05:37.310 --> 05:39.895
It was such a quick look.
You know, he was tall.

05:39.896 --> 05:43.148
With brown hair, early thirties,
scratches all over his face.

05:43.149 --> 05:45.943
He was moving backwards,
like he was being sucked away.

05:45.944 --> 05:47.486
You know, he was shouting.

05:47.487 --> 05:49.863
None of this means anything to me.

05:49.864 --> 05:51.990
He saw me.
He knows that I can see him.

05:51.991 --> 05:54.743
Good. Maybe now he'll figure out
it's you he's supposed to be haunting.

05:54.744 --> 05:57.788
Thanks. But I don't think so.
He seemed pretty focused on you.

05:57.789 --> 06:00.289
What do you mean, focused?

06:00.458 --> 06:04.211
You know, maybe you should come
and stay with Jim and I tonight.

06:04.212 --> 06:07.631
- Is he gonna hurt me?
- No. I didn't see anything like that.

06:07.632 --> 06:11.718
It was more like desperation, fear,
like he was confused.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.595
Things to look forward to
when you're dead.

06:13.596 --> 06:15.347
Come on. Just stay with us.

06:15.348 --> 06:17.015
We'll watch a movie or something.
It'll be fun.

06:17.016 --> 06:18.225
No. Not a chance.

06:18.226 --> 06:20.477
I am not gonna be chased
out of my own home,

06:20.478 --> 06:22.270
small and draughty though it may be.

06:22.271 --> 06:24.064
I am woman. Hear me roar.

06:24.065 --> 06:26.691
You know, I've heard you scream,
and it is not inspiring.

06:26.692 --> 06:30.362
Thanks a lot.
Nevertheless, I'm staying put.

06:30.363 --> 06:33.698
All right, but promise me
you'll call me if anything happens.

06:33.699 --> 06:36.952
Do not show him that you're afraid.
It makes him stronger.

06:36.953 --> 06:40.914
Okay. I'll be fine, all right?
See you in the morning.

06:40.915 --> 06:42.457
I'm gonna sleep
with the phone by my pillow.

06:42.458 --> 06:44.958
- Okay.
- All right.

06:47.546 --> 06:50.046
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

06:55.721 --> 06:58.221
Cesar's Way

07:15.616 --> 07:19.366
I am not afraid of you.
Do you hear me?

07:19.703 --> 07:23.773
So just get out of here
and leave me alone!

07:38.764 --> 07:42.433
I am never, ever
setting foot in that place again.

07:42.434 --> 07:45.520
Hey, you're good to stay here
as long as you want. Okay?

07:45.521 --> 07:46.813
You hungry? You want some food?

07:46.814 --> 07:49.314
No. Thanks, Jim.

07:50.734 --> 07:52.318
What are we gonna do?

07:52.319 --> 07:56.073
Why is this... Whatever it is, after me?

07:56.156 --> 07:58.491
I need to be with you
when the spirit comes again,

07:58.492 --> 08:01.077
see if I can figure out what he wants.

08:01.078 --> 08:02.995
Well, if he's after
my last pint of Cherry Garcia,

08:02.996 --> 08:06.957
he can pry it out of my cold,
dead fingers.

08:06.958 --> 08:10.795
Hey, Andrea, it's okay to be scared.
You don't have to make jokes.

08:10.796 --> 08:13.296
Who's joking?

08:23.809 --> 08:26.143
He's here.

08:26.144 --> 08:27.853
Fell down.

08:27.854 --> 08:30.354
Who fell?

08:31.066 --> 08:33.566
Andrea.

08:44.078 --> 08:46.080
He's gone.

08:46.081 --> 08:48.581
He definitely knows you.

08:50.627 --> 08:54.087
I got a better look at him this time.

08:58.968 --> 09:02.971
All of this is right after college.
We took a train trip through Europe.

09:02.972 --> 09:04.556
No ghost-boy in here.

09:04.557 --> 09:06.225
Well, that takes us through the 90's.

09:06.226 --> 09:08.769
- You know, I liked your hair in college.
- Right.

09:08.770 --> 09:11.688
I'd rather be chased by the haunted
hiking boots than look like that again.

09:11.689 --> 09:14.189
Blah.

09:14.275 --> 09:16.902
Oh. That's when I was
at the DA's office.

09:16.903 --> 09:18.487
You know, you never talk about that.

09:18.488 --> 09:20.572
You know, it seems like
two lifetimes ago.

09:20.573 --> 09:23.367
I don't even really remember
who I was back then.

09:23.368 --> 09:25.619
- Were you happy?
- I don't know.

09:25.620 --> 09:28.413
I mean, I thought
I had everything I wanted,

09:28.414 --> 09:30.165
but there was always
something missing.

09:30.166 --> 09:32.375
I could never quite put my finger on it.

09:32.376 --> 09:35.420
Well, it looks like
the search for it's been fun.

09:35.421 --> 09:38.548
But the search is not over, my friend.

09:38.549 --> 09:40.425
That's him! There he is.

09:40.426 --> 09:41.927
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Totally.

09:41.928 --> 09:44.721
God, that's Dennis, Dennis McMartin.

09:44.722 --> 09:45.889
I can't believe it.

09:45.890 --> 09:47.724
That guy was only in the office
a couple of months.

09:47.725 --> 09:49.768
What do you remember about him?

09:49.769 --> 09:53.629
God, he was kind of quiet,
you know? Shy.

09:54.357 --> 09:56.775
Cute.

09:56.776 --> 09:59.402
He quit to take a trip around the worid.

09:59.403 --> 10:01.613
We had so many conversations
about that.

10:01.614 --> 10:04.824
He was gonna give up
the whole suit-and-tie thing and...

10:04.825 --> 10:07.325
God. Now he's dead?

10:08.621 --> 10:11.206
Do you remember where he lived?

10:11.207 --> 10:14.937
Manhattan, but that was
a few years ago.

10:15.461 --> 10:17.003
I don't understand.

10:17.004 --> 10:20.632
Why is this guy haunting me?
I never did anything to him.

10:20.633 --> 10:23.801
Well, he's obviously
trying to reach you for some reason.

10:23.802 --> 10:26.302
Let's find out why.

10:27.014 --> 10:29.140
You guys are too good to me.

10:29.141 --> 10:31.309
That's what couches are for.

10:31.310 --> 10:33.061
Is there gonna be
a chocolate on my pillow?

10:33.062 --> 10:35.355
Not unless the cat throws it up.

10:35.356 --> 10:38.858
Listen, if anything happens,
you just yell.

10:38.859 --> 10:40.485
You might want to sleep
with the light on.

10:40.486 --> 10:43.321
Are you kidding me?
I'd arrange stadium lighting if I could.

10:43.322 --> 10:45.615
"I am woman, hear me roar."

10:45.616 --> 10:49.660
Hey, I'll make the jokes,
thank you very much.

10:49.661 --> 10:51.537
Melinda.

10:51.538 --> 10:53.998
I don't know what I would do
if I didn't know you.

10:53.999 --> 10:55.875
I can't imagine
going through this alone.

10:55.876 --> 10:58.756
Hey. Don't even think about it.

11:00.255 --> 11:02.131
We're gonna get through this.

11:02.132 --> 11:03.716
- Okay.
- Thanks.

11:03.717 --> 11:05.676
Hey, you know, there's plenty of room
here on the floor,

11:05.677 --> 11:07.637
if you guys wanna crash
down here with me and...

11:07.638 --> 11:10.014
No?

11:10.015 --> 11:12.515
Night.

11:19.441 --> 11:21.025
She's really shaken up.

11:21.026 --> 11:23.319
Yeah. I just feel so bad for her,
you know?

11:23.320 --> 11:26.655
She's never been targeted like this
by a spirit.

11:26.656 --> 11:28.324
Yeah, not like us old pros.

11:28.325 --> 11:30.911
Pros, maybe. Old? Never.

11:33.788 --> 11:35.581
Do you think that we've done enough?

11:35.582 --> 11:38.209
- What about?
- You know, in life...

11:38.210 --> 11:41.211
So far, do you feel like
we've done enough?

11:41.212 --> 11:46.392
Ask me in 40 years.
Well, if I can still hear you then.

11:47.010 --> 11:50.304
I was just looking
through Andrea's photo albums today,

11:50.305 --> 11:53.135
and she's just done everything.

11:54.017 --> 11:58.270
You know, travelled the worid,
had an important job in the big city.

11:58.271 --> 12:00.314
She's interested in everything.

12:00.315 --> 12:04.359
And yet she is now sleeping peacefully
on our living room couch.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.029
Yeah. All roads lead to Grandview.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.405
Ours did.

12:08.406 --> 12:12.993
Come on, you can't compare your life,
or ours, to anyone.

12:12.994 --> 12:14.953
Who knows where you're gonna be
in five years.

12:14.954 --> 12:17.874
Yeah. I wonder sometimes.

12:19.500 --> 12:23.810
I just... I don't know,
feel a little trapped.

12:24.797 --> 12:27.297
No, of course not.

12:27.675 --> 12:30.175
I mean by what I can do.

12:31.262 --> 12:34.639
It just feels like
it's never gonna be any different

12:34.640 --> 12:38.100
no matter where we are or what we do.

12:39.437 --> 12:45.275
I think you're right.
I don't think it's gonna be any different.

12:45.276 --> 12:50.323
It's gonna be you and me in love.
Grandview or Egypt.

12:51.324 --> 12:55.604
And I can't think
of a bigger life than that.

13:14.889 --> 13:17.389
Andrea!

13:17.641 --> 13:19.058
- You all right?
- What's going on?

13:19.059 --> 13:21.759
- Melinda.
- Don't be afraid.

13:29.778 --> 13:33.282
I'm not dead.

13:34.742 --> 13:37.242
Honey, what's up?

13:49.614 --> 13:51.323
Why would a ghost say he's not dead?

13:51.324 --> 13:52.491
Dennis McMartin

13:52.492 --> 13:55.035
I don't know, sometimes
they don't know, can't believe it.

13:55.036 --> 13:57.496
They're in denial
so they don't cross over.

13:57.497 --> 13:59.623
But he must have
died pretty recently, right?

13:59.624 --> 14:00.957
I can't tell yet.

14:00.958 --> 14:04.127
Okay, so it gives us a home number,
phone in the city,

14:04.128 --> 14:05.962
an emergency contact,
brother, Charles.

14:05.963 --> 14:08.089
Works at a gas station on Route 59.

14:08.090 --> 14:11.676
All right, guys,
I'm gonna start calling the morgues.

14:11.677 --> 14:14.346
The number's been disconnected.
I'm gonna try to track down the brother.

14:14.347 --> 14:16.514
I'm gonna see if I can find
another family member.

14:16.515 --> 14:19.184
And which of us is actually
gonna be making a living today?

14:19.185 --> 14:21.685
- I know.
- Okay.

14:44.543 --> 14:47.043
Hi.

14:48.380 --> 14:50.798
Oh, God. I am...

14:50.799 --> 14:52.675
I am so sorry. I...

14:52.676 --> 14:54.677
St.
John's

14:54.678 --> 14:57.972
Oh, yeah, that's okay.
I'm knocking things over all the time.

14:57.973 --> 15:00.433
Can you tell me if
a Charlie McMartin works here?

15:00.434 --> 15:01.893
You're looking for Charlie?

15:01.894 --> 15:03.603
Yeah, kind of.

15:03.604 --> 15:06.314
Well, you should've called 'cause
Charlie doesn't work here anymore.

15:06.315 --> 15:08.649
Yeah, I tried his place
and I just got his machine,

15:08.650 --> 15:10.026
and no one answered here.

15:10.027 --> 15:11.486
It gets busy sometimes.

15:11.487 --> 15:14.072
Look, I really need to see him.
Do you know where he is?

15:14.073 --> 15:16.074
What for?

15:16.075 --> 15:18.743
- Do you know Charlie well?
- Yeah, he's my boyfriend.

15:18.744 --> 15:23.790
Oh. That's great.
I'm an old friend of his brother Dennis.

15:23.791 --> 15:25.833
Oh. Right.

15:25.834 --> 15:30.421
Good. I thought you're
probably too tall for Charlie.

15:30.422 --> 15:32.465
- Andrea Moreno.
- Libby Grant.

15:32.466 --> 15:35.216
Oh, got a customer. Excuse me.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.803
Libby, do you know
where either of them are?

15:37.804 --> 15:39.847
Oh, well, the thing is,
Charlie's not really my boyfriend.

15:39.848 --> 15:41.724
I figured if I kept saying it,
it might come true,

15:41.725 --> 15:43.059
but he quit a couple weeks ago.

15:43.060 --> 15:45.186
- 10 bucks and a quart of 40-weight.
- Sure.

15:45.187 --> 15:47.438
- Do you know why?
- Not really.

15:47.439 --> 15:49.398
It was about the time
his brother came in to see him.

15:49.399 --> 15:52.151
- Dennis?
- Yeah. Here you go.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.611
Charlie hadn't seen him in a long time.

15:53.612 --> 15:55.362
Didn't seem like they
liked each other very much.

15:55.363 --> 15:58.407
Dennis wanted him to go on some trip,
some guy thing.

15:58.408 --> 16:01.202
- Did he go?
- You ask a lot of questions.

16:01.203 --> 16:03.496
Look, I'm not trying
to put you on the spot here,

16:03.497 --> 16:06.040
but no one's heard
from Dennis in a really long time.

16:06.041 --> 16:07.249
GRANT

16:07.250 --> 16:11.587
I have a feeling that things may not be
very good for him right now.

16:11.588 --> 16:14.715
I don't know if Charlie went.
I haven't talked to him since he quit.

16:14.716 --> 16:15.883
I've left messages.

16:15.884 --> 16:19.303
- When was that?
- A week and a half, two weeks ago.

16:19.304 --> 16:20.846
Is there any other family?

16:20.847 --> 16:22.306
Charlie takes care of his father,

16:22.307 --> 16:24.391
but he doesn't talk too much
about those kind of things.

16:24.392 --> 16:27.227
He's a hard guy to get to know,
believe me, I've been trying.

16:27.228 --> 16:28.896
Have you spoken to the father?

16:28.897 --> 16:31.315
I drove by the house once,
but no one came to the door.

16:31.316 --> 16:33.150
I'm sorry, but I really should...

16:33.151 --> 16:35.736
All right. I'm sorry.
Look. Here's my cell.

16:35.737 --> 16:38.530
Please get in touch with me
if you hear from Charlie.

16:38.531 --> 16:41.031
- Sure.
- Thanks.

16:42.577 --> 16:45.077
TYRE BARGAINS

16:48.750 --> 16:51.250
ST JOHN
3W 28B

17:11.689 --> 17:14.648
- Is it a Bible passage?
- Not from any Bible I've ever heard of.

17:14.650 --> 17:16.943
You know, that is so weird.
I ran every database on Dennis.

17:16.944 --> 17:19.570
- It's like he was a phantom.
- Parents?

17:19.571 --> 17:22.073
Libby said that she thought
Charlie was taking care of his father.

17:22.074 --> 17:24.451
Came up with tons of listings
of people with the same last name.

17:24.452 --> 17:25.660
No luck.

17:25.661 --> 17:28.079
So, Dennis leaves his job,
drops everything,

17:28.079 --> 17:30.457
starts a new life,
and leaves no trace of himself?

17:30.458 --> 17:32.000
Well, we know he went
to see his brother,

17:32.001 --> 17:35.045
and we know that they went
somewhere together.

17:35.046 --> 17:38.214
St John.
Do you remember him being religious?

17:38.215 --> 17:39.674
Not really.

17:39.675 --> 17:41.926
I do remember him volunteering
at a hospital

17:41.927 --> 17:44.304
and doing some pro bono work
at a senior centre.

17:44.305 --> 17:46.639
Wait a minute. Maybe it's a hospital.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.851
There's a St John's hospital
over in Bay Ridge.

17:49.852 --> 17:53.188
- You know, but he's dead.
- Maybe he's in the morgue.

17:53.189 --> 17:56.024
Family doesn't know that he's dead,
his body's unclaimed.

17:56.025 --> 17:57.817
What do the numbers mean then?

17:57.818 --> 18:00.403
Could be numbers they use
to ID dead bodies.

18:00.404 --> 18:02.739
Oh, God. Do we really have to do this?

18:02.740 --> 18:08.530
No. We could just let him haunt you
for the rest of your life.

18:11.749 --> 18:14.208
ST JOHN'S HOSPITAL
EMERGENC Y - Main Entrance

18:14.209 --> 18:16.377
I'm sorry. We just can't give out names.

18:16.378 --> 18:18.129
No, I understand.
My husband's a paramedic.

18:18.130 --> 18:20.548
I just thought maybe you could tell us
if there were any unidentified

18:20.549 --> 18:22.258
or unclaimed bodies in your morgue.

18:22.259 --> 18:23.593
I don't know.

18:23.594 --> 18:26.679
We're looking for a friend of mine.
It's really important.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.973
- You can see me.
- Not now. Sorry.

18:28.974 --> 18:33.144
But nobody will tell me
what happened. Please.

18:33.145 --> 18:35.479
You know I hate coming to hospitals.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.356
Nothing's coming up. I'm sorry.

18:37.357 --> 18:40.234
Will this help?
Is this, like, an ID number?

18:40.235 --> 18:41.736
This is a unit number.

18:41.737 --> 18:45.239
Three West, 28 B.
That's intensive care.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.740
Thank you.

18:50.537 --> 18:53.037
3W 28b

19:13.951 --> 19:16.953
His name is Dennis McMartin.
I used to work with him.

19:16.954 --> 19:18.330
Family? Relatives?

19:18.331 --> 19:20.582
Well, he has a brother,
but we haven't been able to find him.

19:20.583 --> 19:23.413
- No one missed him?
- We did.

19:23.669 --> 19:25.629
Couple of park rangers brought him in.

19:25.630 --> 19:28.548
He was found by a hiker
up on Saddle Mountain.

19:28.549 --> 19:30.175
Looks like he fell a good distance.

19:30.176 --> 19:32.469
Head trauma,
at least some brain damage.

19:32.470 --> 19:34.262
<i>And, from the looKs of his clothes</i>

19:34.263 --> 19:36.389
<i>and the abrasions
on his Knees and elbows,</i>

19:36.390 --> 19:38.767
<i>he crawled a long way
before he passed out.</i>

19:38.768 --> 19:42.771
<i>No ID. No bacKpacK.
We tooK him in as a John Doe.</i>

19:42.772 --> 19:45.106
Did you have to resuscitate him
at any point?

19:45.107 --> 19:46.232
Why do you ask?

19:46.233 --> 19:48.860
Well, I was just wondering
how close he came to dying.

19:48.861 --> 19:52.030
- As a matter of fact he did die.
- Several times, total flatline.

19:52.031 --> 19:53.573
But we brought him back
with the paddles.

19:53.574 --> 19:55.533
And there was nobody else
found with him?

19:55.534 --> 19:58.036
Nope. Just like he dropped in
from the sky.

19:58.037 --> 19:59.495
Who else should we notify?

19:59.496 --> 20:02.696
We're still looking for his family.

20:06.545 --> 20:09.005
We need to stick close by
in case he flatlines again.

20:09.006 --> 20:10.882
So, Dennis has been coming
to us when he dies,

20:10.883 --> 20:12.508
and then going away
when they bring him back?

20:12.509 --> 20:13.968
You know what?
This is a first for me, too.

20:13.969 --> 20:17.959
I'm gonna call Jim
and get a search going.

20:18.724 --> 20:21.059
McMartin. Charles McMartin.

20:21.060 --> 20:23.603
Your guy didn't register
with the station,

20:23.604 --> 20:26.147
which is something
all climbers are required to do.

20:26.148 --> 20:27.940
Maybe he didn't know that.

20:27.941 --> 20:30.193
What your guy probably did
was climb Dead Man's Ridge,

20:30.194 --> 20:31.360
which is a no-no.

20:31.361 --> 20:34.030
We have people getting hurt and killed
up there all the time.

20:34.031 --> 20:36.115
Not supposed to be
on that side of the mountain.

20:36.116 --> 20:37.325
You started a search yet?

20:37.326 --> 20:39.826
Search for what? For who?

20:39.828 --> 20:41.871
We think his brother
might have been with him.

20:41.872 --> 20:44.999
- Nobody's told me anything about that.
- I'm telling you now.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.460
You sure? You got proof?

20:47.461 --> 20:50.713
I can't go calling search-and-rescue out
on a wild goose chase.

20:50.714 --> 20:54.633
I need to know for sure if somebody's
up there and really needs help.

20:54.634 --> 20:57.553
I'm not trying to tell you
how to do your job.

20:57.554 --> 21:04.134
I'm just asking you. Trust me.
I'm sure the guy's brother is up there.

21:06.396 --> 21:10.150
What if it was your brother, your son?

21:20.368 --> 21:22.911
One of my guys found this
up near the ridge.

21:22.912 --> 21:25.792
It was going to lost and found.

21:28.918 --> 21:30.753
CHARLIE McMARTIN

21:30.754 --> 21:34.824
That's him. That's his brother.
He is here.

21:37.927 --> 21:40.971
This is Ranger Neher.
We're gonna need a chopper.

21:40.972 --> 21:44.433
<i>Copy that. We"ll be airborne
in about 10 minutes.</i>

21:44.434 --> 21:46.351
<i>You were right, Mel. He"s here.</i>

21:46.352 --> 21:48.187
<i>They"re putting
a search party together.</i>

21:48.188 --> 21:49.605
Thanks. Jim, that's great.

21:49.606 --> 21:50.981
<i>- I'll see you at home.
- OKay.</i>

21:50.982 --> 21:54.212
<i>- Okay. Drive safe. Bye.
- Bye-bye.</i>

21:55.778 --> 21:58.278
Hey. How you doing?

21:59.657 --> 22:01.158
How's Dennis?

22:01.159 --> 22:04.279
I just came from there. No change.

22:04.704 --> 22:08.832
- Do you think he's gonna make it?
- I like to have hope.

22:08.833 --> 22:10.876
You know, you seem
like a really nice person.

22:10.877 --> 22:13.044
Thanks. So do you.

22:13.045 --> 22:19.092
I hope you don't mind me saying this,
but you're also incredibly beautiful.

22:19.093 --> 22:21.593
Are you flirting with me?

22:22.597 --> 22:25.891
Yes. Would that just be
totally inappropriate?

22:25.892 --> 22:28.392
In every way possible.

22:30.229 --> 22:32.729
Okay.

22:33.274 --> 22:35.150
Hey.

22:35.151 --> 22:36.276
What'd I miss?

22:36.277 --> 22:41.467
<i>Code blue. Three west.
Dr Peltier. Code blue. Three west.</i>

22:50.833 --> 22:52.417
- Tell them to stop.
- Where's your brother?

22:52.418 --> 22:54.918
He's up on the ridge.

22:55.337 --> 22:56.504
They'll never know where to look.

22:56.505 --> 22:59.465
- Is he alive?
- I left him alive. I have to show you.

22:59.466 --> 23:02.636
- Tell me.
- I can't I have to...

23:06.056 --> 23:08.433
Don't let them bring me back.
Tell them to let me go.

23:08.434 --> 23:11.102
- I can't do that.
- Please, my brother will die!

23:11.103 --> 23:13.603
Clear!

23:14.231 --> 23:17.317
Don't let them bring me back.
I'm broken. I can't help in that body.

23:17.318 --> 23:19.818
Clear.

23:21.697 --> 23:24.824
Blood pressure's up. We've got rhythm.
60 over 98.

23:24.825 --> 23:27.243
He's stabilising, Doctor.

23:27.244 --> 23:29.744
What is going on?

23:31.498 --> 23:33.998
He wants to die.

23:40.782 --> 23:43.867
You want me to delay
resuscitating my patient

23:43.868 --> 23:47.287
so you can talk to his spirit guide
or whatever that is?

23:47.288 --> 23:48.497
I'm not sure if that's what I'm asking.

23:48.498 --> 23:49.915
I'm just trying to talk to you about this.

23:49.916 --> 23:51.416
You want me to risk his life?

23:51.417 --> 23:54.628
I'm asking for a matter of seconds
to save someone else's life.

23:54.629 --> 23:56.296
No. Anything else?

23:56.297 --> 23:59.299
Doctor, I know how this sounds,
but Melinda's telling the truth.

23:59.300 --> 24:01.051
Dennis's brother is still up
on that mountain.

24:01.052 --> 24:02.469
The park rangers found his backpack.

24:02.470 --> 24:04.971
I think the park rangers
are better equipped to find him

24:04.972 --> 24:06.806
than my comatose patient is.

24:06.807 --> 24:08.266
Look, you can make fun of me
if you want.

24:08.267 --> 24:10.226
I know you're doing
all you can do to help Dennis,

24:10.227 --> 24:11.394
and I respect that.

24:11.395 --> 24:13.646
All I'm asking for
is the chance to do the same.

24:13.647 --> 24:17.942
This is not a magic show, Miss Gordon.
There are protocols.

24:17.943 --> 24:21.029
There are strict medical procedures
that have to be followed.

24:21.030 --> 24:23.656
It's very cut and dried and clear.

24:23.657 --> 24:26.993
There is nothing cut and dried or clear
about my worid or yours.

24:26.994 --> 24:28.244
You just don't get it.

24:28.245 --> 24:31.915
Look, why don't we just take a breath
here for a minute, okay?

24:31.916 --> 24:34.416
I've got work to do.

24:36.545 --> 24:41.090
Look, he's really not a bad guy.
I mean, he's just always been this way.

24:41.091 --> 24:46.031
If he doesn't see it,
then he doesn't believe in it.

24:46.764 --> 24:51.024
- That was Libby. She needs to see me.
- Okay.

24:53.228 --> 24:54.604
I found this last night.

24:54.605 --> 24:57.440
I would've called you,
but it was pretty late.

24:57.441 --> 24:59.442
This is Charlie's handwriting.

24:59.443 --> 25:00.693
DAD

25:00.694 --> 25:04.447
Oh, my God.
They were both up there with him.

25:04.448 --> 25:06.866
Look, did Charlie ever talk
about his dad?

25:06.867 --> 25:08.451
He mentioned him once.

25:08.452 --> 25:11.072
- When?
- The night he quit.

25:11.163 --> 25:14.373
<i>Charlie was talKing about his brother
and how much he resented him.</i>

25:14.374 --> 25:16.208
<i>Said he left him holding the bag.</i>

25:16.209 --> 25:19.378
<i>Charlie and Dennis were supposed
to taKe turns going to college.</i>

25:19.379 --> 25:21.130
<i>Dennis was supposed
to get his degree</i>

25:21.131 --> 25:23.090
<i>and then come bacK
and taKe over his dad"s print shop</i>

25:23.091 --> 25:25.591
<i>so that Charlie could go.</i>

25:26.303 --> 25:28.471
But Dennis didn't come back.

25:28.472 --> 25:31.223
He came to work in New York,
which is where I met him.

25:31.224 --> 25:35.060
Charlie had to try to run the business
by himself, then he lost it.

25:35.061 --> 25:37.980
He tried to go to college,
his father got sick.

25:37.981 --> 25:40.357
So he had to take
dead-end jobs like this one.

25:40.358 --> 25:42.858
Guess he blamed Dennis.

25:45.906 --> 25:49.409
He just... He just looked so sad.

25:50.744 --> 25:54.079
I thought that maybe
I could make him a little happier

25:54.080 --> 25:56.880
if he ever gave me the chance.

25:59.794 --> 26:02.864
Libby, we found Charlie's brother.

26:03.465 --> 26:07.010
He's in the hospital. He's in a coma.

26:07.093 --> 26:08.302
What about Charlie?

26:08.303 --> 26:12.639
We don't know. He could be hurt
or his father could be hurt.

26:12.640 --> 26:16.685
One of them would have had
to have stayed behind.

26:16.686 --> 26:20.314
Look, I have to get back to the hospital.
But, thank you so much for this.

26:20.315 --> 26:23.567
No, wait. I have to do something.
Tell me how I can help.

26:23.568 --> 26:29.068
I promise, as soon as I know anything,
I'll call you, okay?

26:35.163 --> 26:37.456
I think they found the money
in his right-hand pocket

26:37.457 --> 26:40.257
and the keys were in his left.

26:41.335 --> 26:43.835
You really look stressed.

26:44.672 --> 26:48.562
Andrea, you can't neglect
your own health.

26:48.926 --> 26:51.803
Why don't we do a quick exam
while you're here.

26:51.804 --> 26:54.848
- Lf you'd just remove your top...
- Will you get lost?

26:54.849 --> 26:56.725
Where's your sense of humour?

26:56.726 --> 26:59.352
I could never get away
with this stuff when I was alive.

26:59.353 --> 27:02.439
- It's not like she can hear me.
- Go away.

27:02.440 --> 27:05.191
- Who are you talking to?
- Never mind.

27:05.192 --> 27:07.569
Even ghosts can act
like eighth-graders.

27:07.570 --> 27:08.778
What's up?

27:08.779 --> 27:10.947
Stuff they found in Dennis's pockets.

27:10.948 --> 27:15.368
Dr Peltier gave it to me to look through.
I gave this to him.

27:15.369 --> 27:17.704
I threw him a going-away party.

27:17.705 --> 27:19.164
<i>We didn"t Know him very well,</i>

27:19.165 --> 27:21.416
<i>but we felt liKe
we should do something.</i>

27:21.417 --> 27:24.377
<i>I cannot believe he"d still have that.</i>

27:24.378 --> 27:28.631
God, you know, I really envy you,
travelling around the worid.

27:28.632 --> 27:30.592
Everyone says you've
already been around the worid.

27:30.593 --> 27:31.968
<i>You Know what, it"s liKe...</i>

27:31.969 --> 27:33.553
<i>It"s liKe when you Know
someone"s about to watch</i>

27:33.554 --> 27:36.306
<i>a great movie that
they"ve never seen before.</i>

27:36.307 --> 27:38.391
<i>And you"re almost more excited
than they are</i>

27:38.392 --> 27:42.202
<i>about what"s gonna happen next,
you Know?</i>

27:43.772 --> 27:47.232
I think this guy had a thing for you.

27:50.112 --> 27:52.530
Dennis.

27:52.531 --> 27:55.031
Dennis, can you hear me?

27:55.909 --> 27:59.849
We know your dad is up there
with Charlie.

27:59.997 --> 28:02.587
We're gonna find them, okay?

28:09.339 --> 28:12.675
I had the biggest crush
on you back then.

28:12.676 --> 28:15.476
You didn't know that, did you?

28:16.054 --> 28:18.554
You were so mysterious

28:20.058 --> 28:22.558
and quiet

28:22.978 --> 28:25.478
and smart.

28:28.233 --> 28:30.733
I was so lost.

28:32.362 --> 28:35.082
I couldn't show it to anyone.

28:36.700 --> 28:40.400
And I could see that you were lost, too.

28:40.704 --> 28:43.956
But the difference between us was that

28:43.957 --> 28:47.897
you had the guts
to do something about it.

28:48.170 --> 28:51.797
You saw that it was time
to move on and...

28:51.798 --> 28:54.298
And you changed your life.

28:56.094 --> 29:00.774
And it made me see
that I had been standing still.

29:04.185 --> 29:08.285
You gave me the courage
to go forward again.

29:23.413 --> 29:25.913
So thanks for that, Dennis.

29:28.543 --> 29:33.093
For what you did for me,
without even knowing it.

29:34.632 --> 29:37.132
Hey.

29:37.260 --> 29:39.760
Look.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.850
Dr Peltier.

29:47.729 --> 29:50.481
- What?
- He was crying.

29:52.650 --> 29:55.861
Now, that is just
an accumulation of fluid.

29:55.862 --> 29:57.904
It doesn't mean he's responding to you.

29:57.905 --> 29:59.781
How do you know that
he's not feeling something?

29:59.782 --> 30:01.449
I don't know, Miss Gordon.

30:01.450 --> 30:04.911
All I have is my medical training
and 15 years of experience,

30:04.912 --> 30:07.372
but I know that's no match
for the things you know.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.873
Not an exact match, no.

30:16.507 --> 30:19.467
Code blue! Get them out of here.

30:21.762 --> 30:23.680
Ready.

30:23.681 --> 30:25.640
Defib cart in here.

30:25.641 --> 30:28.141
Clear the area.

30:31.814 --> 30:34.065
Okay, Doctor.

30:34.066 --> 30:35.775
Charge, ready, 100.

30:35.776 --> 30:38.276
- And clear!
- Here we go.

30:39.029 --> 30:41.949
Nothing. He's flat. No response.

30:42.032 --> 30:44.242
Juice me up. Let's go again.

30:44.243 --> 30:47.288
200. Ready. And clear!

30:50.541 --> 30:53.041
Dennis?

30:57.548 --> 31:00.048
Dennis, don't do this!

31:24.783 --> 31:27.283
- Call it.
- 10:07.

31:30.622 --> 31:33.122
We lost him.

31:42.634 --> 31:45.134
We have to find my family.

31:53.435 --> 31:55.353
Now, look, we're gonna be there
in a half an hour

31:55.354 --> 31:59.824
and we might have a lead
on the location, right?

32:01.569 --> 32:04.069
You okay?

32:04.196 --> 32:06.572
I will be.

32:06.573 --> 32:09.073
Is he here?

32:09.576 --> 32:12.346
Ask him, why'd he come to me?

32:12.746 --> 32:15.081
It took a while.

32:15.082 --> 32:17.333
A while for me to know
what was happening.

32:17.334 --> 32:20.128
I had the feeling of waking up.

32:20.129 --> 32:22.630
<i>I was looKing down on someone.</i>

32:22.631 --> 32:24.966
<i>I was watching them worK on me
and I wondered why</i>

32:24.967 --> 32:27.467
<i>because I felt so good.</i>

32:27.970 --> 32:30.470
<i>Light, clear-headed.</i>

32:31.139 --> 32:35.309
<i>I remember thinKing I didn"t wanna go
bacK into that body.</i>

32:35.310 --> 32:39.272
<i>I never wanted to give up
this feeling I had.</i>

32:39.273 --> 32:42.567
<i>Then I remembered my brother.</i>

32:43.819 --> 32:47.154
<i>He was still up there with my father.
I had to help.</i>

32:47.155 --> 32:50.116
<i>And no one could see me or hear me.</i>

32:50.117 --> 32:54.995
<i>I tried to move.
I tried to pull the tubes out of me.</i>

32:54.996 --> 32:57.581
<i>I couldn"t do anything.
I started to panic.</i>

32:57.582 --> 33:02.952
<i>Then I thought of Andrea.
Her face just came into my head.</i>

33:03.755 --> 33:06.507
<i>How Kind she was to me at worK.</i>

33:06.508 --> 33:08.259
<i>How good she was
to everyone around her.</i>

33:08.260 --> 33:10.928
<i>And I just Kept thinKing of her, and...</i>

33:10.929 --> 33:13.764
<i>It was as if the thought itself
pulled me away.</i>

33:13.765 --> 33:16.016
<i>I couldn"t control anything.</i>

33:16.017 --> 33:19.478
<i>I just felt liKe I Knew
where I was going.</i>

33:19.479 --> 33:20.771
<i>I was screaming at her.</i>

33:20.772 --> 33:21.981
Andrea!

33:21.982 --> 33:24.482
<i>She couldn"t hear me</i>

33:26.778 --> 33:32.198
<i>I didn"t Know what to do.
I felt myself being pulled bacK.</i>

33:32.492 --> 33:36.537
<i>I didn"t wanna come bacK.
I was cold in that body, in pain,</i>

33:36.538 --> 33:38.539
<i>I didn"t wanna feel
any of that anymore.</i>

33:38.540 --> 33:40.749
<i>I remember wanting to cry.</i>

33:40.750 --> 33:45.170
<i>I would go to sleep for a while
and then feel that pull again.</i>

33:45.171 --> 33:48.590
<i>I Kept coming bacK to Andrea.
I didn"t even Know how.</i>

33:48.591 --> 33:51.761
<i>I just had to get to her, somehow.</i>

33:53.429 --> 33:57.683
He wanted to get through to you.
Thought maybe you'd help.

33:57.684 --> 33:59.768
He'd barely said
more than a few words to me

33:59.769 --> 34:01.853
the entire time we were in that office.

34:01.854 --> 34:07.014
I guess she made more
of an impressión than you thought.

34:13.074 --> 34:15.699
<i>Air support niner.
We have visual contact.</i>

34:15.701 --> 34:18.451
<i>Your search party is in sight.</i>

34:22.792 --> 34:24.125
Air support, air support,

34:24.126 --> 34:25.835
this is ranger ground leader.
Do you copy?

34:25.835 --> 34:28.213
<i>Ranger ground leader, we copy.</i>

34:28.214 --> 34:30.090
<i>- Stay on course.
- Roger.</i>

34:30.091 --> 34:33.927
We're headed west, the upper trail.
Monitor channel three open.

34:33.928 --> 34:35.387
We'll call you
when we get to the ridgeline.

34:35.388 --> 34:36.554
<i>Roger that. We copy.</i>

34:36.554 --> 34:39.139
Let's go, guys! Move it! Move it!

34:39.141 --> 34:42.143
Keep your distance.
Keep spacing going up the hill.

34:42.143 --> 34:43.353
They're going the wrong way.

34:43.353 --> 34:44.646
But this is where they found you.

34:44.647 --> 34:46.398
But I crawled here from another trail,
up that way.

34:46.399 --> 34:47.732
He's saying they're going
the wrong way.

34:47.733 --> 34:49.109
You know what?
You're going the wrong way.

34:49.110 --> 34:51.194
Excuse me?
And just how do you know that?

34:51.195 --> 34:53.362
Tell him we always took the back way
up to Dead Man's Ridge.

34:53.364 --> 34:55.281
Because that's the way they
always went, the back way.

34:55.282 --> 34:57.158
Look, you people don't belong here.

34:57.159 --> 34:59.786
Why don't you just head back
to the trailhead and wait there?

34:59.787 --> 35:01.120
We'll let you know
when we find something.

35:01.121 --> 35:02.664
Look, I'm going. Do what you want.

35:02.665 --> 35:05.416
You know, A: She's my wife,
and B: She's right.

35:05.417 --> 35:07.877
It doesn't matter how,
but I'm telling you, she's right.

35:07.878 --> 35:10.998
Have a little faith. Deal with it.

35:18.180 --> 35:20.680
Son of a bitch.

35:21.725 --> 35:23.017
We're close.

35:23.018 --> 35:25.019
My father used to bring us
up here when we were kids,

35:25.020 --> 35:27.772
whenever we were getting out of
control and he wanted us to bond.

35:27.773 --> 35:29.148
That's why you brought
them up here again?

35:29.149 --> 35:30.608
Yeah, half the way up, Charlie slipped

35:30.609 --> 35:32.068
and I went off the ridge
trying to grab him.

35:32.069 --> 35:34.569
He fell down there.

35:42.955 --> 35:45.455
Okay.

35:47.251 --> 35:52.941
<i>This is air support niner.
We have climbers on the east slope.</i>

36:06.728 --> 36:08.354
There he is.

36:08.355 --> 36:11.395
Hey, buddy, you're gonna be okay.

36:13.235 --> 36:17.045
- Where's his father?
- Where's your dad?

36:18.073 --> 36:20.449
I never kept a promise my whole life,

36:20.450 --> 36:23.661
but I promised I'd scatter his ashes
on this mountain.

36:23.662 --> 36:25.996
It's a place where
he was always so happy

36:25.997 --> 36:27.164
and he tried to make us happy.

36:27.165 --> 36:28.415
Guys, he's right here.

36:28.416 --> 36:30.334
He's responding,
he's got a pulse and he's breathing.

36:30.335 --> 36:32.336
He's got to have internal injuries,
but he's stable

36:32.337 --> 36:34.588
I don't think it's spinal.

36:34.589 --> 36:37.089
How did you...

36:37.342 --> 36:40.428
Here we go. One, two, three.

36:43.014 --> 36:45.514
You're okay, you're okay.

36:46.601 --> 36:48.310
Radio down the chopper.

36:48.311 --> 36:51.271
Make sure they take care of him.

36:53.316 --> 36:55.816
Looking good.

36:57.820 --> 37:00.822
If you're looking for the brother,
he's over there.

37:00.823 --> 37:03.323
You okay?

37:03.618 --> 37:06.118
Not sure.

37:06.954 --> 37:10.540
What the hell happened
when Dennis died in that room?

37:10.541 --> 37:12.334
How did we lose control like that?

37:12.335 --> 37:16.797
We found his brother alive and well.
That's all that really matters.

37:16.798 --> 37:19.508
What would have happened
had I delayed resuscitation?

37:19.509 --> 37:21.384
Would it really have made
a difference?

37:21.385 --> 37:25.639
Look, you live in a worid where you can
sometimes influence life and death,

37:25.640 --> 37:27.432
and I respect that.

37:27.433 --> 37:30.685
But sometimes,
it's just out of our hands,

37:30.686 --> 37:32.103
at least on Earth.

37:32.104 --> 37:36.524
Are you telling me
people come back after they die?

37:36.525 --> 37:39.025
Do you know a Dr Norris?

37:39.487 --> 37:42.817
He was my intern. He died last year.

37:42.990 --> 37:45.490
He wants to say thank you.

37:45.868 --> 37:48.368
What are you talking about?

37:50.081 --> 37:54.751
About the time he was scared.
A patient had died on him.

37:54.752 --> 37:58.379
You knew how upset he was
and you told him,

37:58.380 --> 38:00.465
"You'll save many more people
than you'll lose.

38:00.466 --> 38:02.467
"And no one can save them all."

38:02.468 --> 38:05.348
That's what got him through it.

38:06.180 --> 38:07.805
I barely remember that.

38:07.806 --> 38:10.306
Well, he never forgot it.

38:10.351 --> 38:13.561
And he wants to give that back
to you now.

38:13.562 --> 38:17.148
He wants you to know
that you were like a big brother to him.

38:17.149 --> 38:19.108
I was?

38:19.109 --> 38:21.609
Look how surprised he is.

38:22.738 --> 38:28.128
Tell him I'm sorry he never knew
how much I got from him.

38:29.078 --> 38:30.578
He's a great teacher.

38:30.579 --> 38:33.829
He's saying you're a great teacher.

38:36.460 --> 38:39.920
This can't be happening. It can't be.

38:41.340 --> 38:45.490
And he's sorry
that he couldn't say goodbye.

38:47.638 --> 38:50.138
He was my best intern,

38:50.390 --> 38:55.520
even though he couldn't keep his mind
off of the giris.

38:58.899 --> 39:01.399
I had high hopes for him.

39:04.571 --> 39:09.301
You have no idea how hard that was
for him to say.

39:15.123 --> 39:17.876
Hey, tell him,

39:18.960 --> 39:23.560
"What you can see
is only half of what there is."

39:31.389 --> 39:36.649
If you ever want to talk more about this,
I'll be there.

39:41.775 --> 39:44.275
Thank you.

40:13.723 --> 40:16.223
I should never have left.

40:16.559 --> 40:20.739
Charlie was the smart one.
He had the brains.

40:20.813 --> 40:22.898
I should have come back
and taken over for him.

40:22.899 --> 40:25.901
You came back now, son,
when it counts the most,

40:25.902 --> 40:28.570
when you had the most to give up.

40:28.571 --> 40:30.405
You did good, Dennis.

40:30.406 --> 40:32.282
I've been waiting all this time

40:32.283 --> 40:37.493
for the two of you
to make things right with each other.

40:41.250 --> 40:46.254
Will you tell my brother that
everything's good with me now.

40:46.255 --> 40:48.755
That

40:49.925 --> 40:52.425
I'm okay.

40:52.470 --> 40:56.300
Tell him that he's free to take his shot.

41:10.196 --> 41:14.240
Tell him that I'll always
be looking out for him.

41:14.241 --> 41:16.741
Me and the old man.

41:18.078 --> 41:22.338
Come with me now.
Everybody's waiting for you.

41:23.292 --> 41:26.003
- Who?
- You'll see.

41:32.634 --> 41:36.429
Will you tell Andrea
that I had a crush on her, too?

41:36.430 --> 41:38.930
I will.

41:51.111 --> 41:52.612
Are they gone?

41:52.613 --> 41:55.031
Yeah.

41:55.032 --> 41:57.532
Wow.

41:58.243 --> 42:00.995
Never been this close
when it's happened.

42:00.996 --> 42:02.997
You know what?

42:02.998 --> 42:07.648
He wanted you to know
he has a crush on you, too.

42:07.836 --> 42:10.336
Great.

42:10.839 --> 42:14.409
Well, that's another one that got away.
