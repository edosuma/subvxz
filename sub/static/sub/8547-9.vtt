Looks like our unsub's
highly skilled.

11:12.009 --> 11:13.509
Still frenzied.

11:13.511 --> 11:14.843
Body was found here?

11:14.845 --> 11:15.978
Norwood: Sitting up.

11:15.980 --> 11:18.113
Kate: But it was dragged
from over there.

11:18.115 --> 11:20.282
If the unsub were a fit guy,

11:20.284 --> 11:23.652
he'd probably be able
to lift her completely off the floor.

11:23.654 --> 11:26.288
This person couldn't,
which suggests

11:26.290 --> 11:28.357
he may be
weak or injured

11:28.359 --> 11:29.892
or possibly a woman.

11:29.894 --> 11:32.194
So the unsub again
put her in something new.

11:32.196 --> 11:33.696
There are no perforations.

11:33.698 --> 11:35.664
So where's the vic's
original clothes?

11:35.666 --> 11:39.401
Seems like a lot
of effort to expend for trophies.

11:52.850 --> 11:54.917
Bingo.

11:59.690 --> 12:01.957
So the unsub cleaned them.

12:01.959 --> 12:04.526
Probably washed the other
victims' stuff as well.

12:04.528 --> 12:05.627
We'll check their homes.

12:05.629 --> 12:08.330
Washing could be
a forensic countermeasure.

12:08.332 --> 12:10.766
A male offender would have
destroyed the clothes.

12:10.768 --> 12:12.534
Our unsub's a woman.

12:12.536 --> 12:16.238
Let's get CSI to sweep
all the other lint filters

12:16.240 --> 12:19.508
for trace evidence
of the killer.

12:19.510 --> 12:22.411
Hotch: So Jessica called you
from the salon last night?

12:22.413 --> 12:26.548
Yeah. I can't believe this.

12:26.550 --> 12:28.417
And how was your
conversation?

12:28.419 --> 12:30.252
Did anything seem
out of the ordinary?

12:30.254 --> 12:34.056
No. We were in the middle
of a little argument,

12:34.058 --> 12:36.492
but Jessica and I
always argued.

12:36.494 --> 12:38.527
What was
yesterday's about?

12:38.529 --> 12:39.828
Jessica went off on a client

12:39.830 --> 12:42.731
and wanted me to say
she was justified.

12:42.733 --> 12:45.501
Was she afraid that
the client would retaliate?

12:45.503 --> 12:50.172
No. Customers stiffed her
all the time.

12:50.174 --> 12:53.709
Jessica had a tendency
to go scorched earth

12:53.711 --> 12:55.944
when she should have
just stayed quiet.

12:55.946 --> 12:58.046
And how did she end
the conversation?

12:58.048 --> 12:59.448
It was quick.

12:59.450 --> 13:01.350
But that was normal, too.

13:01.352 --> 13:04.052
It's just usually
she'd call me back

13:04.054 --> 13:07.656
and...she didn't.

13:07.658 --> 13:09.024
I'm sorry.

13:09.026 --> 13:10.893
That's all right.

13:10.895 --> 13:12.961
Victim number two,
Rick Mendoza,

13:12.963 --> 13:14.429
had a direct
personality.

13:14.431 --> 13:16.064
He would tell it
like it is at the body shop.

13:16.066 --> 13:18.400
And Jessica had the same
sort of reputation at the salon.

13:18.402 --> 13:20.102
Since all of our victims
are in the service industry,

13:20.104 --> 13:22.371
maybe our unsub interfaced
with them and had bad interactions.

13:22.373 --> 13:24.006
Someone might have
seen something.

13:24.008 --> 13:26.074
We'll keep interviewing co-workers
and surrounding business owners.

13:26.076 --> 13:29.111
I'll have Garcia look at Jessica's clients.
Maybe somebody retaliated.

13:29.113 --> 13:31.079
Morgan: The wounds
are all over the place.

13:31.081 --> 13:32.414
JJ: Rage might be
an understatement.

13:32.416 --> 13:33.982
[Cell phone vibrates]
This offender had patience.

13:33.984 --> 13:35.818
She's been scrubbed
perfectly clean.

13:35.820 --> 13:38.787
Rossi and Kate think we might
be looking for a female killer.

13:38.789 --> 13:41.924
The unsub washed
the victims' clothes as well.

13:41.926 --> 13:45.194
You know, this might all fall under
the umbrella of "one neat aspect."

13:45.196 --> 13:47.663
I've heard of that.
In the midst of a chaotic crime scene,

13:47.665 --> 13:49.164
one thing gets
special attention

13:49.166 --> 13:50.465
and is cleaned
or organized.

13:50.467 --> 13:52.467
Yeah, in this case,
it could mean anything related

13:52.469 --> 13:55.470
to cleaning the victim, including washing
their bodies or their clothes.

13:55.472 --> 13:57.673
It's possible our unsub was recently
released from an institution

13:57.675 --> 13:59.508
where she learned
regimented behavior.

13:59.510 --> 14:01.977
Yeah. We should check
long-term mental facilities and prisons,

14:01.979 --> 14:04.980
even recently discharged
military personnel.

14:04.982 --> 14:06.114
What's this?

14:06.116 --> 14:08.116
I pulled if off
the vic's smock.

14:08.118 --> 14:09.484
It doesn't match her DNA.

14:09.486 --> 14:11.486
So it either belongs
to a client from earlier

14:11.488 --> 14:13.488
or it could possibly
be our unsub's.

14:13.490 --> 14:15.157
Thank you very much
for your time.

14:15.159 --> 14:17.226
Let's get back to the BAU.

14:17.228 --> 14:18.193
Garcia: Hey, Rossi.

14:18.195 --> 14:20.095
We just got back.
You got something?

14:20.097 --> 14:22.664
Not about the case,
but I found something mysterious.

14:22.666 --> 14:24.967
I ran that license
of the car

14:24.969 --> 14:26.501
of the woman
that's following you.

14:26.503 --> 14:28.003
It turns out it's a rental,

14:28.005 --> 14:29.538
and she is far from a P.I.

14:29.540 --> 14:31.373
She's actually
a TV crime reporter

14:31.375 --> 14:33.342
in San Francisco.
Her name is Joy Struthers.

14:33.344 --> 14:35.244
Wait. Crime reporter?

14:35.246 --> 14:36.979
Yeah. And she writes
her own blog,

14:36.981 --> 14:39.348
and last year
she self-published a novel

14:39.350 --> 14:40.716
about the Zodiac killer.

14:40.718 --> 14:42.050
Stop. I've heard enough.

14:42.052 --> 14:43.852
I think she's a fan girl.

14:43.854 --> 14:45.320
Is that another name
for crazy person?

14:45.322 --> 14:47.222
It's a psycho fan who
thinks I'm Comic-Con.

14:47.224 --> 14:49.825
Rossi, I think she just wants
a blurb for her next book.

14:49.827 --> 14:53.195
Which she needs, because
the last one only sold 385 copies.

14:53.197 --> 14:55.530
387. I bought two
'cause I felt bad.

14:55.532 --> 14:57.366
You can't diss a girl
for trying.

14:57.368 --> 14:58.867
Oh, yes, I can.

14:58.869 --> 15:00.535

who wants a mentor.

15:04.708 --> 15:06.341
Do you believe this?

15:06.343 --> 15:08.710
Look on the bright side. It's not one
of your exes looking for more money.

15:08.712 --> 15:10.646
No, it's a weirdo
looking for tutelage.

15:10.648 --> 15:11.914
I tried that once.

15:11.916 --> 15:14.349
The woman left
her manuscript all over my house.

15:14.351 --> 15:16.051
Wait. She broke in?

15:16.053 --> 15:17.053
6 times.

15:17.054 --> 15:18.387
Well, where is she now?

15:18.389 --> 15:19.988
She's doing 5 to 10.

15:19.990 --> 15:21.823
Ooh. Classy.

15:23.827 --> 15:25.360
Anything?

15:25.362 --> 15:27.796
Lots of long brown hairs in the dryer.
They don't match the victim.

15:27.798 --> 15:28.764
We found hair, too.

15:28.766 --> 15:29.965
Maybe the unsub's
losing it.

15:29.967 --> 15:31.066
Or our victims
yanked it out

15:31.068 --> 15:32.401
while fighting
for their lives.

15:32.403 --> 15:34.503
Clearly, she not
forensically sophisticated.

15:34.505 --> 15:35.938
We should run it for DNA.

15:35.940 --> 15:38.307
We might get an I.D.
or at least ethnicity and an age range.

15:38.309 --> 15:39.708
Because of
the one neat aspect,

15:39.710 --> 15:42.077
we had Garcia check out
people in regimented institutions,

15:42.079 --> 15:43.378
but she came up empty.

15:43.380 --> 15:45.714
Did she check out D.C.,
Maryland, and Virginia?

15:54.024 --> 15:57.793

Clearly her desire to kill is unabated.

22:42.542 --> 22:44.576
intermittent explosive disorder.

22:44.578 --> 22:46.911
This disorder usually occurs
after a traumatic event.

22:46.913 --> 22:49.080
It involves repeated
acts of impulsive

22:49.082 --> 22:51.182
and aggressively
violent behavior.

22:51.184 --> 22:53.651
It involves angry outbursts where
the sufferer reacts

22:53.653 --> 22:55.553
in disproportion
to the situation.

22:55.555 --> 22:58.389
In this case, the unsub
lets her anger fester,

22:58.391 --> 23:00.892
then later lashes out.
We believe she had prior confrontations

23:00.894 --> 23:02.560
with all the victims.

23:02.562 --> 23:04.395
After she kills
or is thinking about killing,

23:04.397 --> 23:05.830
we believe that she's
pulling her out hair out.

23:05.832 --> 23:07.799
This is called
tricotillomania,

23:07.801 --> 23:09.467
and it's a way that
she relieves stress.

23:09.469 --> 23:11.136
She'll appear rational
at times

23:11.138 --> 23:14.906
but be triggered by
external disputes or confrontations.

23:14.908 --> 23:16.674
Her anger and remorse
will make her feel like

23:16.676 --> 23:18.109
she has two personalities.

23:18.111 --> 23:20.912
And we believe she was hospitalized
because of mental problems

23:20.914 --> 23:23.214
but she stopped taking
her medication since being released.

23:23.216 --> 23:25.383
And since she's no longer
in the environment

23:25.385 --> 23:26.818
that helped her control
her urges,

23:26.820 --> 23:28.353
she's been triggered
to start killing.

23:28.355 --> 23:29.854
We see no indication

23:29.856 --> 23:32.323
that these homicidal feelings
in her will subside.

23:32.325 --> 23:33.992
We believe she will
continue to kill

23:33.994 --> 23:37.162
as long as she encounters
stressors that set her off.

23:43.470 --> 23:47.839
[Muted overlapping voices]

24:20.307 --> 24:23.208
[Starts engine]

24:25.645 --> 24:27.912
Michael, what are you
doing here?

24:27.914 --> 24:30.348
I needed to talk to you.

24:30.350 --> 24:32.650
Well, it's gotta wait.
Honey, I gotta go pick up Max

24:32.652 --> 24:33.851
from basketball practice.

24:33.853 --> 24:35.720
No, Kathy's gonna
take care of that.

24:35.722 --> 24:38.356
Kathy? Why Kathy?

24:38.358 --> 24:41.826
Because you're not
doing well, Ellen.

24:42.696 --> 24:44.696
I'm fine.

24:44.698 --> 24:45.997
You're far from fine.

24:45.999 --> 24:48.166
Ever since the accident,
you've been acting strange.

24:48.168 --> 24:50.101
Staying out late,
leaving early.

24:50.103 --> 24:52.503
Michael, I have
a ton of work to do.

24:52.505 --> 24:55.974
Add that to what I found
upstairs, I don't know what to say.

24:55.976 --> 24:58.843
What you found?

24:58.845 --> 25:01.679
Michael, you went
through my things?

25:06.319 --> 25:08.820
This is your shirt.

25:08.822 --> 25:11.656
It was in the back
of your closet.

25:11.658 --> 25:14.192
What did you do, Ellen?

25:14.194 --> 25:15.793
Oh, honey.

25:15.795 --> 25:17.362
On the news they're talking
about a woman

25:17.364 --> 25:19.631
who's hurting people
and pulling out her hair?

25:19.633 --> 25:21.299
Did you hurt those people?

25:21.301 --> 25:22.867
Of course not.

25:22.869 --> 25:25.036
You weren't home last night.
Now your boss is dead.

25:25.038 --> 25:26.771
No.
Did you hurt her?

25:26.773 --> 25:29.240
So that's a coincidence?

25:29.242 --> 25:30.642
What did you do?

25:30.644 --> 25:32.343
Where did you get
that bruise?

25:32.345 --> 25:35.179
I can't help you unless
you're honest with me.

25:39.085 --> 25:41.152
[Quietly] Oh, god.

25:47.394 --> 25:49.594
Oh, Michael.

26:04.844 --> 26:07.412
I killed them.

26:08.848 --> 26:09.914
Why?

26:09.916 --> 26:11.349
I don't know.

26:11.351 --> 26:14.018
I don't know.

26:14.020 --> 26:15.920
I just did it.

26:15.922 --> 26:18.690
I tried to stop
and I can't.

26:18.692 --> 26:20.291
I know. I know.

26:20.293 --> 26:21.659
Listen, we're gonna
get you help.

26:21.661 --> 26:23.628
I'm gonna be by your side.

26:23.630 --> 26:24.662
Oh, Michael.

26:24.664 --> 26:25.963
I'm right here, ok?

26:25.965 --> 26:28.766
Oh, Michael, I don't know
what's happening to me.

26:28.768 --> 26:30.468
You're sick.

26:30.470 --> 26:32.170
We're gonna
get through this.

26:32.172 --> 26:33.172
I'm sorry.

26:33.173 --> 26:35.039
I know.

26:35.041 --> 26:37.075
We have to tell
the police.

26:37.077 --> 26:39.410
Oh, no, Michael, no,
I can't. No.

26:39.412 --> 26:40.978
They need to know
the truth.

26:40.980 --> 26:43.348
Michael, no. Are you
listening to me? No!

26:43.350 --> 26:45.983
Are you listening, Michael?!

26:50.690 --> 26:53.091
Oh, my god! Ellen.

26:54.361 --> 26:55.460
Uhh!

26:55.462 --> 26:58.763
Help me.

27:02.902 --> 27:05.203
Ok, come on.

27:05.205 --> 27:08.339
Get out, out, out.

27:08.341 --> 27:11.075
[Door opens]

27:12.245 --> 27:13.644
Oh, my God.

27:13.646 --> 27:16.247
What the hell happened?!

27:16.249 --> 27:17.515
Dad?

27:17.517 --> 27:18.517
I can explain.

27:18.518 --> 27:19.784
Dad!

27:19.786 --> 27:21.719
Come on, let's go.
Let's go!

27:22.922 --> 27:25.757
Ok, I know that we said we weren't
looking for an addict.

27:25.759 --> 27:27.392
What about somebody
who was in rehab,

27:27.394 --> 27:29.260
is now off drugs
and out?

27:29.262 --> 27:30.461
Theory?

27:30.463 --> 27:31.929
Same structured behavior.
Similar routines

27:31.931 --> 27:33.164
to being institutionalized.

27:33.166 --> 27:35.233
No, there's no one
who fits the profile

27:35.235 --> 27:36.667
in any drug rehab center.

27:36.669 --> 27:37.668
Can you check
surrounding areas?

27:37.670 --> 27:38.736
I checked every state.

27:38.738 --> 27:39.971
What else could have
caused her I.E.D?

27:39.973 --> 27:42.240
Frontal lobe damage from
a head injury of some sort.

27:42.242 --> 27:44.642
Then maybe she had to undergo
inpatient physical therapy.

27:44.644 --> 27:47.545
A rehabilitation program would have
exposed her to regimented behavior.

27:47.547 --> 27:49.013
And the moment
that she was released

27:49.015 --> 27:50.481
or started driving her car,

27:50.483 --> 27:52.016
her rage could have been
triggered.

27:52.018 --> 27:53.251
And check physical rehab
centers as well.

27:53.253 --> 27:55.586
On it.

27:57.757 --> 27:59.223
You're kidding.

27:59.225 --> 28:00.391
What?

28:00.393 --> 28:03.127
Nothing.
I'll be right back.

28:04.497 --> 28:07.565
What the hell
are you doing here?

28:07.567 --> 28:08.567
I can explain.

28:08.568 --> 28:10.168
You come to my job?

28:10.170 --> 28:11.436
I need to talk to you.

28:11.438 --> 28:12.804
You're crazy.
You're not a P.I.

28:12.806 --> 28:15.039
You're a reporter
trying to be a novelist.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.707
How the hell did you
even get in here?

28:16.709 --> 28:18.075
I got a press pass.

28:18.077 --> 28:19.644
Press pass?
I had to see you.

28:19.646 --> 28:21.846
Look, if I catch you
at my work again,

28:21.848 --> 28:24.282
you'll be writing an opus
from behind bars.

28:24.284 --> 28:25.216
Security!

28:25.218 --> 28:26.551
No, please
don't do this.

28:26.553 --> 28:27.753
Escort her out of here.
Please.

28:27.754 --> 28:29.086
Out.

28:29.088 --> 28:30.888
I'm your daughter!

28:46.355 --> 28:48.672
I have checked all
local rehab facilities

28:48.673 --> 28:50.373
for recently released
patients that fit the profile.

28:50.375 --> 28:51.775
I'm still coming up empty.

28:51.777 --> 28:55.645
And what about private
or HMO-run physical rehab centers?

28:55.647 --> 28:57.113
Wait...

28:57.115 --> 28:58.648
Uh, uh, ok, 10 months ago

28:58.650 --> 29:01.217
a woman named Ellen Connell
was in a horrible car accident

29:01.219 --> 29:03.453
that put her in an HMO
rehab center for 4 months.

29:03.455 --> 29:04.587
What happened?

29:04.589 --> 29:07.657
Her car collided
with two teen girls.

29:12.130 --> 29:13.997
[Crash]
Ohh!

29:15.734 --> 29:17.333
How bad was Ellen hurt?

29:17.335 --> 29:20.003
So bad that she had hundreds of days
of physical therapy

29:20.005 --> 29:22.872
due to head injuries.
She was released a month ago,

29:22.874 --> 29:24.207
a week before
the first killing.

29:24.209 --> 29:25.642
She must have had
frontal lobe damage

29:25.644 --> 29:27.510
that destroyed
her impulse control.

29:27.512 --> 29:30.480
And since she's developed
I.E.D, she's no longer able able to control

29:30.482 --> 29:31.948
her bursts of rage
and the violence that follows.

29:31.950 --> 29:33.483
So she's fine
until she gets mad.

29:33.485 --> 29:34.684
But after she kills
and her anger subsides,

29:34.686 --> 29:36.486
she reverts back
to her normal behavior.

29:36.488 --> 29:37.921
Is there any overlap
of the victims?

29:37.923 --> 29:40.790
She works at the same
architectural firm as her latest victim.

29:40.792 --> 29:42.458
And she specializes
in doors and windows.

29:42.460 --> 29:44.627
That's how she was able
to get in and out of the crime scenes.

29:44.629 --> 29:45.895
She also ordered
a bunch of wigs

29:45.897 --> 29:47.163
and lives two blocks away

29:47.165 --> 29:48.631
from the third victim's
hair salon.

29:48.633 --> 29:50.900
All right, send the address
to our phones.

29:52.904 --> 29:54.771
My mom is Hayden Montgomery.

29:54.773 --> 29:57.207
You married her
in '84 in Paris.

29:57.209 --> 29:58.975
I know who Hayden is.

29:58.977 --> 30:01.110
She was a diplomat, you were
on temporary duty with the FBI.

30:01.112 --> 30:03.213
Hayden would have told me
if she was pregnant.

30:03.215 --> 30:04.347
Ok, my dad--

30:04.349 --> 30:06.349
my stepdad told me
about you

30:06.351 --> 30:07.851
when he was dying
of cancer,

30:07.853 --> 30:10.453
and it forced my mom
to finally come clean.

30:10.455 --> 30:11.721
How can I believe you?

30:11.723 --> 30:13.389
First you tell me you're a P.I.
And now this?

30:13.391 --> 30:16.526
Ok, I was scared.
Look, you can even call my mom.

30:16.528 --> 30:17.594
She's still in Paris.

30:17.596 --> 30:19.329
Hey, Rossi.
We gotta go.

30:19.331 --> 30:21.931
We'll straighten
this out later.

30:21.933 --> 30:24.534
Leave your info
at the front desk.

30:41.753 --> 30:45.288
So why was she here?
What did she want?

30:45.290 --> 30:47.023
Nothing.

31:11.016 --> 31:13.483
You ok?

31:14.386 --> 31:16.819
Yeah. I'm fine.

31:25.830 --> 31:28.364
Mom, where are we going?

31:28.366 --> 31:29.532
Shut up.

31:29.534 --> 31:30.967
Why are you doing this?

31:30.969 --> 31:33.770
Just drive.

31:33.772 --> 31:36.739
We need to go to
482 Crow's Nest Lane.

31:36.741 --> 31:37.707
Who lives there?

31:37.709 --> 31:40.009
It doesn't matter.
Just move.

31:40.011 --> 31:42.679
[Crying]

31:53.224 --> 31:55.024
Got a victim down here.

31:56.895 --> 31:57.927
Dave?

31:57.929 --> 31:59.462
Anything?

31:59.464 --> 32:01.264
Abby Benson.
One of the girls

32:01.266 --> 32:03.533
Ellen was in
the accident with.

32:05.337 --> 32:06.703
[Ring]
Willing and able.

32:06.705 --> 32:08.604
Garcia, we're outside
of Ellen Connell's office.

32:08.606 --> 32:10.640
Check her IP address and see if she
was trying to reach

32:10.642 --> 32:13.109
an Abby Benson recently.

32:13.111 --> 32:15.244
Looks like
she followed her on Twitter

32:15.246 --> 32:17.080
the moment
she got out of rehab.

32:17.082 --> 32:19.415
She checks her Instagram daily.

32:19.417 --> 32:20.650
How about today?

32:20.652 --> 32:22.485
Pop goes the weasel.

32:22.487 --> 32:24.988
She googled Abby's address
from her phone 10 minutes ago.

32:24.990 --> 32:26.389
It's her endgame.

32:26.391 --> 32:27.957
Thanks, Garcia.

32:27.959 --> 32:29.225
Get out.

32:29.227 --> 32:30.159
Get out!

32:30.161 --> 32:31.527
Mom, what are we
doing here?

32:31.529 --> 32:33.730
If we hurry, we can do this.

32:33.732 --> 32:35.431
Whose house is this?

32:35.433 --> 32:36.899
Would you stop talking!

32:41.206 --> 32:42.772
Hi, may I help you?

32:42.774 --> 32:45.008
Yes. I'm Ellen Connell, the one
your daughter hit with her car.

32:45.010 --> 32:46.109
Excuse me?

32:46.111 --> 32:47.877
Oh, my God!
[Screaming]

32:47.879 --> 32:48.945
Mommy, please!

32:48.947 --> 32:50.346
[Gasping]

32:50.348 --> 32:52.115
What's going on?

32:53.952 --> 32:55.218
Who are you?!

32:55.220 --> 32:58.388
The woman whose life
you destroyed.

33:06.816 --> 33:08.650
Just admit
you were wrong.

33:08.651 --> 33:10.751
The accident
was your fault!

33:10.753 --> 33:12.152
I'm the one in the wheelchair.
You hit me!

33:12.154 --> 33:13.787
I didn't hit you!

33:13.789 --> 33:16.690
Yes, you did. You hit her
and you killed her friend.

33:16.692 --> 33:18.325
Mom, she's telling
the truth.

33:18.327 --> 33:19.693
No. Had she been
paying attention,

33:19.695 --> 33:20.961
none of this
would have happened.

33:20.963 --> 33:22.062
I had the right of way.

33:22.064 --> 33:23.030
The ground was wet.

33:23.032 --> 33:24.398
Mom, please--
Shut up!

33:24.400 --> 33:26.099
Whose side are you on?

33:26.101 --> 33:29.136
You ruined my life.

33:29.138 --> 33:30.704
Washed it
into the gutter.

33:30.706 --> 33:33.006
I've lost everything
because of you!

33:33.008 --> 33:34.808
Put the knife down!

33:34.810 --> 33:36.243
[Gasping]

33:36.245 --> 33:37.911
Get out.

33:37.913 --> 33:39.579
Put it down, Ellen.

33:39.581 --> 33:42.315
You don't want to kill her.
You don't want to kill any of them.

33:42.317 --> 33:44.918
Your brain
is tricking you, Ellen.

33:44.920 --> 33:48.455
