In a land of myth and a time of magic,

00:05.173 --> 00:10.219
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.303 --> 00:13.055
His name, Merlin.

00:27.904 --> 00:30.865
| hope your trip isn't too upsetting.

00:30.948 --> 00:33.326
Thank you, Arthur.

00:33.409 --> 00:35.578
Ensure you return to Camelot
before dusk.

00:35.661 --> 00:37.038
Yes, sire.

to her father's grave.

01:10.029 --> 01:11.405
You look troubled, Gwen.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.450
I'm fine.

01:15.159 --> 01:16.702
You're very secretive these days.

01:18.829 --> 01:21.290
I'm beginning to think
there's a man involved.

01:22.667 --> 01:25.378
When do I get to
meet any decent men?

He will have your heads
if any harm comes to me.

| have no intention of harming you,
at least not yet.

02:45.708 --> 02:48.419
You're much more valuable
to me alive,

02:48.961 --> 02:50.463

03:28.292 --> 03:31.045
He's coming.
You know what you must do?

03:36.258 --> 03:38.469
| trust you are comfortable?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.304
| demand to know
where you are taking us.

03:40.388 --> 03:42.515
You'll find out soon enough.

03:42.598 --> 03:45.601
We have a long journey ahead of us.
Get some rest.

You wish to bathe?

| am the King's ward and accustomed
to certain standards.

03:59.573 --> 04:03.786
I'm sure you are quite contented
to stink like a pig, but I am not.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.872
The Lady Morgana wishes to bathe.

If you were any kind of gentleman,
you'd give me some privacy.

04:45.327 --> 04:48.414
Well, unfortunately for you,
I'm no kind of gentleman.

04:48.998 --> 04:50.082
Now get on with it.

05:10.728 --> 05:11.979
You can at least turn your backs.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.273
So you can make a run for it?

05:14.356 --> 05:15.649
Do you think I'm that stupid?

No, no. We'll never out run them.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.949
It's a ransom note.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.895
Hengist has never met the Lady Morgana.

07:58.896 --> 08:02.232
For all he knows, you could be
Uther Pendragon's ward.

-The bandits still have Gwen.
-They were Mercian.

08:22.961 --> 08:26.090
We have heard that
Hengist has crossed the border.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.300
-Hengist?
-Then we must send a rescue party.

08:28.425 --> 08:31.887
If Hengist is holding her,
it would take an army to rescue her.

08:31.970 --> 08:36.225
-We can't abandon her.
-How many men do I send to save her?

08:36.308 --> 08:38.143
As many as it takes.

She did so willingly

-You have to do something...
-My father's right.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.571
I'm afraid there's nothing we can do.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.531
How can you say that?

09:33.574 --> 09:36.076
How can you live with yourselves?

Take her to the dungeon.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.875
How can you be so heartless?

11:06.959 --> 11:09.002
Gwen is the most kind, loyal person

11:09.086 --> 11:13.131

Perhaps if you stopped shouting
at me for one second,

-Of course I'm going after her.

put them off the scent.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.791
So if we smear ourselves with them,

22:13.917 --> 22:17.295
perhaps we can pass through
the tunnels undetected.

22:21.925 --> 22:24.344
Oh! These stink.

22:25.136 --> 22:26.471
They are really bad.

22:26.596 --> 22:28.598
Perhaps you would you prefer
to be eaten alive?

22:28.681 --> 22:29.807
Pass me some more, will you?

22:40.360 --> 22:42.445
(WILDDEORENS SCREECHING)

22:53.790 --> 22:56.626
- I just stood on something.
-That was my foot.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.545
Oh! Sorry.

23:06.177 --> 23:07.303
How much further is it?

23:07.387 --> 23:08.680
(SHUSHING)

23:16.145 --> 23:18.731
Wilddeoren. They're coming this way.

23:25.071 --> 23:29.158
Whatever happens, keep completely still.

24:14.203 --> 24:15.788
Lancelot.

24:15.872 --> 24:18.207
| was terrified I might find
your cell empty.

24:18.291 --> 24:20.543
There has been no word from Uther.

24:20.627 --> 24:24.464
-Hengist is growing suspicious.
-You must keep up the pretense.

24:24.547 --> 24:26.424
| will not allow you to die here.

24:27.216 --> 24:28.885
What about you?

24:29.260 --> 24:30.720
| have little to live for.

24:30.928 --> 24:32.221
Do not say that.

24:33.222 --> 24:34.432
It is the truth.

24:35.183 --> 24:37.935
For all my words,
for all that I believed,

24:38.186 --> 24:40.229
| have come to nothing.

24:40.313 --> 24:42.982
You are everything that is right
with this world.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.532
| did not know you felt that way.

24:52.367 --> 24:57.622
| didn't even know I could
feel this way about someone.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.544
Then you have given me
a reason to live.

25:08.508 --> 25:12.303
Be ready.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.527
The gaja berries worked.

25:30.780 --> 25:33.866
-You didn't know if they worked?
-Not for sure.

25:35.993 --> 25:37.120
Now you tell me?

25:38.037 --> 25:41.791
"What's that wilddeoren eating?"
“It's all right. It's just Merlin."

25:42.917 --> 25:44.752
Are you trying to get us both killed?

25:45.002 --> 25:48.631
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
risked your life like that.

25:50.925 --> 25:54.178
They do say love makes you
do strange things.

25:54.971 --> 25:57.098
What're you talking about?

25:57.682 --> 26:00.017
Why can't you just admit
your feelings for Gwen?

26:04.021 --> 26:06.983
It's so obvious.
A blind man could see it.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.736
Is it really that hard
to admit you like her?

26:09.819 --> 26:11.904
-Just say it.
-I can't!

26:14.198 --> 26:17.243
How can I admit that I think about
her all the time?

26:18.703 --> 26:22.290
Or that I care about her
more than anyone?

26:23.833 --> 26:27.545
How can I admit that
| don't know what I will do

26:27.628 --> 26:29.714
if any harm comes to her?

26:30.548 --> 26:31.758
Why can't you?

26:31.966 --> 26:34.927
Because nothing can ever
happen between us.

26:36.512 --> 26:39.098
To admit my feelings,
knowing that,

26:40.641 --> 26:42.977
it hurts too much.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.649
Who's to say nothing can happen?

26:49.233 --> 26:51.402
My father won't let me rescue a servant.

26:51.486 --> 26:53.821
Do you think he would let me marry one?

26:53.905 --> 26:57.241
-You want to marry Gwen?
-No. No. I don't know.

27:03.956 --> 27:07.043
It's all talk.
And that's all it ever can be.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.548
When you're king,
you can change that.

27:13.633 --> 27:16.260
| can't expect Guinevere to wait for me.

27:16.928 --> 27:20.723
If she feels as you do,
she'll wait for you.

27:25.645 --> 27:29.982
-We don't even know if she's alive.
-If she is, we will find her.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.944
Come on.
We've got a long trek ahead.

27:33.027 --> 27:35.112
Oh, and Merlin.

27:37.365 --> 27:41.452
If you dare tell anyone about this,

27:42.995 --> 27:47.250
| promise that I will make
your life a living hell.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.211
You mean more than you already do?

27:51.504 --> 27:52.672
Yeah.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.845
We could talk about your feelings
while you walk?

27:58.928 --> 28:00.596
Shut up, Merlin.

28:04.350 --> 28:07.562
Morgana. Morgana!

28:10.439 --> 28:12.692
| keep asking myself.

28:13.359 --> 28:17.321
Why does Uther not pay the ransom?

28:18.906 --> 28:20.616
He is a rich man.

28:21.659 --> 28:24.328
Why would he leave his beloved ward

28:25.413 --> 28:29.292
to suffer a slow and terrible death?

28:29.959 --> 28:31.377
| don't know.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.964
Please. Please...

28:35.172 --> 28:40.553
It must be very upsetting to know
that Uther has abandoned you.

28:40.845 --> 28:46.684
It seems that no one
in the world cares for you.

28:47.435 --> 28:51.689
| don't know why he doesn't pay.
Please. I don't know.

28:54.692 --> 28:56.277
Take her to her cell.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.283
Bring Kendrick to me.

29:02.867 --> 29:04.785
Perhaps he can tell me

29:05.453 --> 29:10.207
why the Lady Morgana has
the hands of a serving girl.

29:19.133 --> 29:20.468

30:15.272 --> 30:19.652
No! Wait!
Wait, Hengist. Hengist, wait.

30:23.197 --> 30:26.200
We did capture the Lady Morgana,

30:26.283 --> 30:28.619
but she escaped.

30:30.121 --> 30:32.415
So who exactly do I have in my dungeon?

30:34.625 --> 30:36.544
The Lady Morgana's maid.

30:41.465 --> 30:43.801
Thank you for being so honest.

30:45.386 --> 30:46.762
Release the wilddeoren.

30:46.846 --> 30:50.057
No! No! Please. I'm begging you!

30:50.391 --> 30:54.061
Hengist! Hengist, please!
Please, Hengist! Hengist!

31:39.148 --> 31:41.192
It will take you out
beyond the castle walls.

31:41.275 --> 31:43.194
| will buy you as much time as I can.

31:44.195 --> 31:45.404
I'm not leaving you.

31:45.488 --> 31:46.530
You must.

31:46.614 --> 31:49.658
No. I will not leave you here to die.

31:49.742 --> 31:52.036
| would die for you
one hundred times over.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.248
Live for me.

31:57.166 --> 32:00.252
Or everything that I am
has been for nothing.

32:10.304 --> 32:13.474
As long as I live,
my feelings for you will never fade.

32:14.725 --> 32:18.270
Run. Don't stop running
until you are well away from here.

32:20.773 --> 32:23.400
Run. Run!

33:26.797 --> 33:29.133
Maybe there's another way in.

33:29.216 --> 33:30.885
Why don't you go and
knock on the front gate?

33:30.968 --> 33:33.929

they'll hand Gwen over to you.

33:57.703 --> 34:00.206
You can do what you will with me.

34:01.457 --> 34:04.919
| do not care.
You can do no harm to Guinevere.

34:07.421 --> 34:09.130
Was that her name?

34:10.799 --> 34:12.134
A serving girl,

34:14.386 --> 34:18.431
and you really believe
she's worth dying for?

34:20.559 --> 34:23.978
She is worth more to me
than you will ever understand.

34:39.119 --> 34:41.288
You thought she'd got away?

34:41.746 --> 34:44.458
No, you failed her.

35:28.043 --> 35:30.337
Now you're just showing off.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.264
You distract them. I'll knock them out.

How do I distract them?

You have nothing to be sorry for.
You reminded me of who I am.

We've got to keep moving.

39:56.937 --> 39:59.940
Thank you, Arthur.
We owe you our lives.

40:19.751 --> 40:22.838
I'm surprised that you would
undertake such a rescue mission

40:24.172 --> 40:25.966
with just the two of you?

40:29.386 --> 40:32.472
My father would not risk the lives
of his knights for a servant.

40:33.140 --> 40:35.726
And yet you disobeyed him
and came here anyway?

40:40.272 --> 40:42.608
The truth is, I only came
because Morgana begged me.
