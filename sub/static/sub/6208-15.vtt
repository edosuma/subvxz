WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:03.350
Yes-um?

00:03.350 --> 00:05.350
Does this sweater make me look fat?

00:05.350 --> 00:06.470
A little.

00:06.470 --> 00:09.070
I don't get it. Zelda's clothes usually fit me fine.

00:09.070 --> 00:11.070
Hilda! Coffees ready.

00:11.830 --> 00:13.370
A-ha! Caught you.

00:13.370 --> 00:15.190
Well I'm kind of hard to miss today.

00:15.190 --> 00:16.520
What's with this sweater?

00:16.520 --> 00:20.320
I put a spell on my clothes so you wouldn't borrow them without asking me.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.100
A booby-trap!

00:22.340 --> 00:24.100
You are so sneaky

00:24.100 --> 00:26.700
You know it makes your legs look really thin.

00:27.990 --> 00:29.320
Huh! It rubbed off?

00:29.320 --> 00:31.350
Yes. I put a time release on it.

00:31.350 --> 00:33.120
You'll be that way for an hour.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.000
You never did learn to share.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.300
Well I'd be happy to if you'd just learn to ask.

00:37.730 --> 00:39.160
What are they arguing about?

00:39.160 --> 00:40.410
Like I listen.

00:40.410 --> 00:41.660
Cute sweater.

00:41.660 --> 00:44.860
It's Zelda's. You might wanna ask her before you put it on.

00:44.860 --> 00:46.560
I'm sure she wouldn't mind.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.560
Look! it fits perfectly.

00:50.710 --> 00:51.910
What's happened?!

00:53.540 --> 00:55.730
Oh-no! She got you too.

00:55.730 --> 00:57.280
The sweaters hexed!

00:57.280 --> 00:59.300
Why can't I just live in a normal house?

00:59.300 --> 01:01.300
Why can't a sweater just be a sweater?

01:01.300 --> 01:03.300
Poor Sabrina.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.900
Zelda! Could you give me a hand here?

01:07.900 --> 01:08.940
Of course.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.990
1x15. Hilda and Zelda the teenage years

01:32.790 --> 01:36.270
Are you kidding? I'd love to meet the Violent Femmes. When? Where?

01:36.270 --> 01:40.070
Well they'll be signing CD's at Music City in Boston tonight at midnight.

01:40.070 --> 01:43.270
Midnight! That's perfect. I have no conflicting plans.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.000
But I still have to ask my aunts.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.200
Just tell them what I told my parents. It's an astrology field trip.

01:48.390 --> 01:50.200
Don't you mean astronomy?

01:50.580 --> 01:53.080
Wow, they're paying even less attention than I thought.

01:53.320 --> 01:56.410
This'll be so much fun. You, me and the Violent Femmes.

01:56.410 --> 01:58.410
You're going to see the Violent Femmes?

01:58.410 --> 01:59.650
Yeah.

01:59.650 --> 02:01.410
You have to let me come with you.

02:01.410 --> 02:03.710
I will do anything to meet Gordon Gano.

02:03.820 --> 02:06.360
You know I hate this word but... Please?

02:06.360 --> 02:07.800
The more the merrier.

02:08.190 --> 02:09.910
All right, you can come.

02:09.910 --> 02:13.410
Thanks! This is so great. I love the Violent Femmes.

02:13.410 --> 02:16.580
You're going to see the Violent Femmes? Can I come too?

02:16.740 --> 02:20.090
No! Jeez Gordie, you can't just invite yourself along.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.550
I thought you just said 'The more the merrier'?

02:22.550 --> 02:24.550
Twist my words, why don't you.

02:24.550 --> 02:27.680
Look. It's my car and I say any Femmes fan is welcome.

02:27.680 --> 02:28.770
So Gordie, you're in.

02:28.770 --> 02:29.450
Cool!

02:29.450 --> 02:30.020
Cool!

02:30.020 --> 02:30.630
Cool!

02:30.630 --> 02:31.790
Shotgun!

02:32.030 --> 02:34.840
Boston? Midnight? Rock band?

02:34.840 --> 02:36.350
It sounds kind of dangerous.

02:36.350 --> 02:38.350
Oh but it's not! It's totally save.

02:38.350 --> 02:40.350
What's the name of the band again?

02:40.350 --> 02:41.860
The Violent Femmes.

02:41.860 --> 02:45.720
Which is completely ironic because there aren't even any Femmes in the band,

02:45.720 --> 02:46.860
let alone violent ones.

02:46.860 --> 02:49.490
Look. Maybe if you had some adult supervision.

02:49.490 --> 02:51.490
Hilda and I could go along?

02:51.490 --> 02:54.990
That'd be the most embarrassing thing ever. I can't show up with old people!

02:54.990 --> 02:56.490
Now don't try sweet-talking us.

02:56.490 --> 02:59.390
You know what I mean. Come on, don't you trust me?

02:59.390 --> 03:01.990
We do, but there are lots of sicko's out there that we don't.

03:01.990 --> 03:05.190
And there's always peer-pressure which can cloud your judgement.

03:05.190 --> 03:07.490
So in other words. You trust me but you don't trust me.

03:07.490 --> 03:09.490
I'm glad our position is clear.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.130
You have to let me go!

03:11.130 --> 03:13.130
Not without adult supervision.

03:13.130 --> 03:16.030
Then I can't go. You guys ruin everything.

03:16.190 --> 03:18.430
We ruin it because we care.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.500
It's so hard.

03:21.840 --> 03:24.560
I wish there was some sort of compromise.

03:24.560 --> 03:28.850
There must be some way to make us all happy. She could...!

03:29.380 --> 03:29.980
No.

03:30.390 --> 03:31.660
Or we could...!

03:31.950 --> 03:32.680
No!

03:33.020 --> 03:34.680
Or what if...!

03:35.570 --> 03:36.700
This stinks!

03:36.700 --> 03:39.600
If it was up to them I'd stay in my room and never have fun.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.930
I'm a house pet, it's hard for me to sympathise.

03:42.580 --> 03:45.370
Hey! Have you checked out the dust bunnies under your bed?

03:45.370 --> 03:46.540
They're fun.

03:48.180 --> 03:49.020
What?

03:49.020 --> 03:50.890
There's someone here to see you.

03:50.890 --> 03:51.890
Who?

03:51.890 --> 03:53.570
Open the door.

03:55.510 --> 03:57.140
Surprise!

03:57.140 --> 03:58.770
Do I know you?

03:58.770 --> 04:00.060
Don't you recognise us?

04:00.060 --> 04:01.520
I'll give you a hint.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.110
That was it.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.570
Oh my god. What are you guys up to?

04:05.770 --> 04:09.240
We know you objected to adult supervision but how do you feel about...

04:09.240 --> 04:10.720
teenage supervision?

04:10.720 --> 04:12.720
You'd go with me to the Violent Femmes?

04:12.720 --> 04:16.269
Yes. Your friends'll never know and you wont have to be embarrassed.

04:16.269 --> 04:18.100
Just incredibly weirded-out.

04:18.930 --> 04:21.410
Aw! This body pinches.

04:21.410 --> 04:22.970
Don't slouch.

04:23.610 --> 04:24.840
So,

04:25.930 --> 04:27.090
what d'ya think?

04:27.090 --> 04:27.640
I don't know.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.590
I mean for one thing your voices do not sound like normal teenagers.

04:30.590 --> 04:32.140
We can change that.

04:33.380 --> 04:34.530
Is this better?

04:35.580 --> 04:36.700
And how about me?

04:37.550 --> 04:39.410
Oops, wrong direction.

04:39.930 --> 04:40.890
There we go.

04:40.890 --> 04:42.890
Not bad. Maybe this could work.

04:42.890 --> 04:44.100
Far-out!

04:44.100 --> 04:44.980
Swell!

04:44.980 --> 04:46.980
Ah! The word is... Cool.

04:46.980 --> 04:47.610
Cool!

04:47.610 --> 04:48.230
Cool!

04:48.960 --> 04:50.160
Cool!

04:50.160 --> 04:51.150
Cool!

04:52.100 --> 04:54.550
That is so creepy.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.120
What are you doing? Harvey'll be here any minute.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.120
I was just making us some snacks.

05:00.450 --> 05:03.060
Hey! I can take stairs two at a time.

05:03.060 --> 05:05.060
Is that what you're planing to wear?

05:05.060 --> 05:05.800
Why not?

05:05.800 --> 05:07.020
Here, try this.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.500
Hey,

05:09.870 --> 05:11.170
don't I look...

05:11.170 --> 05:12.260
Cool.

05:12.260 --> 05:13.220
Next.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.440
My midriff is showing!

05:17.440 --> 05:19.440
You're sixteen, it's okay.

05:19.440 --> 05:22.640
I am not leaving this house dressed like a hussy!

05:22.640 --> 05:24.140
You are or you're not going.

05:25.070 --> 05:26.720
It's Harvey! Let's go!

05:26.720 --> 05:30.260
Now remember. You're my extremely shy cousins Hilda and Zelda.

05:30.260 --> 05:31.120
Wait!

05:31.460 --> 05:33.470
No-one would name their kids that. Okay,

05:33.470 --> 05:36.370
you're Hillary and you're... Zellary.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.250
Zellary?

05:37.250 --> 05:39.250
Yeah. You're parents were hippies. Go!

05:40.970 --> 05:42.980
It's very uncomfortable in here.

05:42.980 --> 05:45.880
Yes but we're teenagers. We don't care.

05:46.490 --> 05:50.150
Can you turn the music down? It's a little hard to take.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.150
It's the Violent Femmes.

05:52.150 --> 05:55.050
Oh! I love them. Turn it up.

05:55.460 --> 05:58.920
Hands back on the wheel! Ten and two! Ten and two!

05:58.920 --> 06:02.120
Jeez! Someone took drivers ed' a little too seriously.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.400
She's right you know.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.520
I'm always saying that to people but they just don't listen.

06:06.520 --> 06:07.670
Fools.

06:07.670 --> 06:09.670
Gordon Gano. Gordon Gano. Gordon Gano.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.670
What are you doing?

06:11.670 --> 06:14.990
Reminding myself why I'm in this clown car.

06:14.990 --> 06:16.990
Gordon Gano...

06:20.210 --> 06:24.170
Just think. The Violent Femmes are breathing this same air.

06:24.170 --> 06:25.190
Cool!

06:25.190 --> 06:26.120
Cool!

06:26.120 --> 06:28.920
...Cool? It's down-right cold, and where are the guys?

06:28.920 --> 06:30.890
Shouldn't they have parked the car by now?

06:30.890 --> 06:32.890
And why isn't this bakery open?

06:32.890 --> 06:35.790
Stop complaining. This is what we drove here for.

06:36.670 --> 06:39.050
How smart! Libby brought a book.

06:39.910 --> 06:43.190
'The Magic Within' Now what's that about?

06:43.190 --> 06:45.190
I'm going to cast a spell on Gordon Gano.

06:45.190 --> 06:48.090
A spell? Like witchcraft?

06:48.270 --> 06:50.140
Oh please. That's just twaddle.

06:50.140 --> 06:52.690
This is a self-help book.

06:52.690 --> 06:55.920
It teaches you how to summon your feminine powers.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.490
That's the magic within.

06:57.490 --> 06:59.150
Hence the title.

06:59.150 --> 07:03.250
And if it works, when I meet Gordon Gano he wont be able to resist me.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.080
What d'ya mean?

07:04.080 --> 07:06.630
Well you'll have to shell out the twelve ninety-five for the details

07:06.630 --> 07:11.630
but I learned how to do this thing with my eyes that will bring any man under my spell.

07:11.630 --> 07:13.630
Does it go something like this?

07:15.030 --> 07:15.940
No.

07:16.670 --> 07:19.270
And I'm not going to waste my powers by showing you.

07:19.270 --> 07:22.770
In fact I'm supossed to start conserving my energy now.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.990
Hey, there they are!

07:25.990 --> 07:27.500
Who? I can't see.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.700
It's Harvey and Gordie.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.700
Man! This line is really long.

07:30.920 --> 07:33.000
Wow Libby, you look cool!

07:33.000 --> 07:34.300
Thanks.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.890
Wait, did Gordie say that?

07:36.890 --> 07:38.890
He knows nothing about cool.

07:40.110 --> 07:41.550
Oh that is so cute.

07:41.550 --> 07:43.350
I wish I'd brought my camera.

07:43.350 --> 07:44.590
What are you doing?

07:44.590 --> 07:45.890
Well I thought you might be cold.

07:45.890 --> 07:49.990
Actually I'm-I'm warm! In fact I'm even feeling a little flushed.

07:49.990 --> 07:53.490
I'm cold. Perhaps because I'm barely dressed?

07:53.490 --> 07:55.490
Oh would you like my scarf?

07:55.490 --> 07:57.790
Thank you Gordie. How kind.

07:57.790 --> 07:59.760
Zellary! Can I speak to you a moment?

07:59.940 --> 08:02.660
What are you thinking? You just took Gordie's scarf!

08:02.660 --> 08:04.220
So? I'll give it back.

08:04.220 --> 08:06.190
No! That means he likes you,

08:06.190 --> 08:09.090
and by accepting it, it means you like him. It's the teenage code!

08:09.090 --> 08:11.090
It's just a scarf.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.650
You are so naive.

08:12.650 --> 08:14.650
We're moving! We're moving!

08:15.020 --> 08:16.740
We've stopped.

08:16.740 --> 08:19.040
I don't believe it. How long is this gonna take?

08:19.040 --> 08:23.140
And Frankly I think it's time for Allan Greenspan to step down.

08:23.140 --> 08:24.640
I couldn't agree with you more.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.520
Well that was a fun conversation.

08:26.520 --> 08:28.110
Now can we talk about anything else?

08:28.110 --> 08:29.660
Music? Cars? Food?

08:29.660 --> 08:31.960
That reminds me, anyone want snacks?

08:31.960 --> 08:32.710
Yeah!

08:32.710 --> 08:35.909
I brought carrot-sticks and hard boiled eggs.

08:35.909 --> 08:37.409
My favourite!

08:37.409 --> 08:39.710
Who taught her what a snack was?

08:39.710 --> 08:42.610
My legs hurt. We should have brought chairs.

08:43.140 --> 08:44.910
Y'know, to sit on.

08:44.910 --> 08:46.910
We know what chairs are.

08:46.910 --> 08:49.510
I'm cold. I wanna go back to the car.

08:49.510 --> 08:50.400
Great idea.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.400
I'll walk you. Harvey, toss me your keys.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.400
Here you go.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.010
Hey! Bad throw.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.810
Let's go.

08:58.380 --> 09:00.650
I can't take the waiting any longer.

09:00.650 --> 09:02.650
I'm going to see what the hold up is.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.450
Boston really seems to have blown your cousins minds.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.510
Yeah, they're not as grown up as they think they are.

09:10.420 --> 09:12.390
Well, at least we're alone know.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.290
Except for the little match girl.

09:18.150 --> 09:21.130
It was very sweet of you to see me back to the car.

09:21.130 --> 09:23.430
I'll make sure to lock the doors when you go back.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.960
I'm not going back.

09:25.810 --> 09:28.050
But... you'll miss the Violent Femmes.

09:28.050 --> 09:31.160
I'd rather be with you. I wanna know everything.

09:31.160 --> 09:34.000
Let's start with how you got such an unusual name?

09:34.350 --> 09:35.660
Zellary.

09:35.660 --> 09:37.660
It's not that unusual.

09:37.740 --> 09:40.630
I think it's tantalising, and very poetic.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.320
It rhymes with celery.

09:44.030 --> 09:46.520
Ha-ha! You are just delightful.

09:52.470 --> 09:53.590
Excuse me!

09:53.590 --> 09:55.590
Hi! I have a question.

09:55.590 --> 09:57.590
Gas station at the corner.

09:57.590 --> 10:00.770
No. My friends and I have been waiting for a very long time

10:00.770 --> 10:02.600
and I'm feeling a tickle in my throat.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.450
So I was wondering if we could pop in,

10:04.450 --> 10:06.400
say hello to the band and go home to bed?

10:06.400 --> 10:09.300
You mean let you cut-in line?

10:09.300 --> 10:11.300
I think...

10:11.300 --> 10:13.600
Andrew Jackson can explain it better than I can.

10:13.850 --> 10:15.760
Hey! I don't let anyone cut.

10:15.760 --> 10:18.080
Especially not for a twenty.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.400
But I'm sick of waiting.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.070
Then you'll have two choices.

10:21.070 --> 10:23.070
Continue to wait or go home.

10:23.070 --> 10:24.700
But I... wha...

10:24.700 --> 10:28.710
Or keep pushing me and you wont get in at all.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.000
Now get back in the line.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.930
I don't like your tone.

10:31.930 --> 10:33.680
I want your badge number.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.220
Move your hand!

10:35.220 --> 10:37.820
I said get back in line, missy.

10:37.820 --> 10:40.720
Missy! Who are you calling missy?

10:40.720 --> 10:42.360
I'm glad you got cold.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.500
Me too.

10:43.850 --> 10:45.500
All warm!

10:45.500 --> 10:47.500
We need to talk.

10:50.430 --> 10:52.760
Gordie just asked me to go steady.

10:52.760 --> 10:54.760
I knew it! What did you say?

10:54.760 --> 10:56.450
Well I'm thinking about it.

10:56.450 --> 10:58.450
What?! I forbid you to date Gordie!

10:58.450 --> 11:01.690
I mean I'm thing about how to say no.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.210
I don't wanna hurt his feelings.

11:04.210 --> 11:07.510
I warned you about wearing his scarf, but would you listen?

11:07.510 --> 11:07.710
No.

11:07.710 --> 11:10.310
Maybe you could talk to him for me?

11:10.310 --> 11:12.780
You got yourself into this mess, you get yourself out.

11:12.780 --> 11:13.990
How else are you gonna learn?

11:14.070 --> 11:16.460
But... I... Unfair!

11:17.060 --> 11:18.680
And don't pout aunt Zelda,

11:18.680 --> 11:20.300
your face is gonna freeze like that.

11:20.300 --> 11:21.570
Now go let him down gently.

11:25.820 --> 11:27.190
What's going on?

11:27.190 --> 11:29.490
Well my cousins got a little problem.

11:29.490 --> 11:31.490
Get back here!

11:31.490 --> 11:33.000
Sabrina! Help!

11:33.260 --> 11:35.000
Isn't that your other cousin?

11:35.590 --> 11:37.000
Yeah.

11:38.320 --> 11:41.970
Just think about it. I've got all night.

11:42.150 --> 11:44.030
Excuse me!

11:44.030 --> 11:44.960
Hi!

11:44.960 --> 11:46.530
Gas station on the corner.

11:46.530 --> 11:49.440
No. You have my cousin in your car and I was just wondering...

11:49.440 --> 11:50.720
Is she in big trouble?

11:50.720 --> 11:52.330
She stole my badge.

11:52.330 --> 11:53.410
I want it back.

11:53.410 --> 11:55.710
If I could just talk to her I'm sure I could straighten things out.

11:55.710 --> 11:57.710
Fine. You talk to her,

11:57.710 --> 11:59.480
'cause I don't want to.

12:04.190 --> 12:06.540
So, would you like to tell me what happened?

12:06.540 --> 12:07.580
No.

12:07.580 --> 12:09.580
I can't help you if you don't tell me.

12:09.580 --> 12:11.040
I didn't do anything.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.190
What's in your hand?

12:13.210 --> 12:15.680
You know if you give the badge back he'll let you go.

12:15.680 --> 12:17.080
I don't want to.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.080
Aunt Hilda! Give the badge back!

12:21.180 --> 12:23.180
Sir. Here's your badge.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.180
Okay! Bye!

12:25.180 --> 12:27.180
Don't you have something else to say?

12:27.180 --> 12:28.570
I'm Sor-ry.

12:28.570 --> 12:30.070
Like you mean it.

12:30.710 --> 12:32.070
I'm sorry.

12:32.070 --> 12:33.470
That's better.

12:33.470 --> 12:34.890
Now go ahead,

12:34.890 --> 12:36.550
get back in line.

12:37.910 --> 12:39.750
I'm glad that's over.

12:39.750 --> 12:41.560
We'll talk about this more at home.

12:45.120 --> 12:48.090
Don't! The pain is still too fresh.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.150
Did they call Hillary's parents?

12:53.150 --> 12:55.940
No. I think I'm cold again.

12:58.780 --> 13:00.210
How are you doing?

13:00.210 --> 13:02.550
Terrible, these hormones are driving me nuts.

13:02.550 --> 13:05.750
I know. I forgot how emotional life is when you're a teenager.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.750
No kidding, once was enough.

13:08.510 --> 13:10.130
Lines moving.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.400
Are we getting close?

13:12.480 --> 13:14.880
Real close. Watch out! Manhole!

13:15.310 --> 13:16.880
Just kidding.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.460
Alright! We're next.

13:19.460 --> 13:22.360
Finally, this is going to make up for everything.

13:23.030 --> 13:27.200
Hi. On behalf of the Violent Femmes I'd like to thank you all for waiting.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.210
Are we going in?

13:28.210 --> 13:31.110
Unfortunately the store is now closed.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.050
What!

13:32.050 --> 13:32.520
What!

13:32.520 --> 13:33.010
What!

13:33.010 --> 13:33.370
What!

13:33.370 --> 13:34.260
Oh boy!

13:34.330 --> 13:36.260
Can I talk to you a moment?

13:36.260 --> 13:38.260
Look, I'm sorry about the timing.

13:38.260 --> 13:40.170
You have to let us in. I mean...

13:40.170 --> 13:41.690
talk about violent femmes.

13:41.690 --> 13:45.220
If they don't meet the band there will be four extremely violent femmes,

13:45.220 --> 13:48.140
and I'm the one who has to drive them all back to Westbridge along

13:48.140 --> 13:49.190
with one love-sick dude.

13:49.190 --> 13:51.070
Do not make me do that.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.480
You know what I'm saying, you've been there right?

13:53.910 --> 13:57.270
Hartford, Led Zeppelin, nineteen seventy-three.

13:58.230 --> 13:59.250
Go on in.

13:59.250 --> 14:00.360
Thank you.

14:01.870 --> 14:04.270
Really, thank you.

14:06.750 --> 14:08.050
Do you see him?

14:08.050 --> 14:08.910
Yes!

14:08.910 --> 14:10.550
There they are!

14:10.550 --> 14:12.790
I thought they said the last group was the last group?

14:12.790 --> 14:15.690
No. I guess the last group was the second to last group.

14:15.690 --> 14:17.980
Now this group is the last group.

14:20.470 --> 14:22.230
Thanks for coming.

14:22.410 --> 14:23.180
Thanks for coming.

14:23.180 --> 14:24.250
Thanks for coming.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.450
Thanks for coming.

14:25.450 --> 14:26.450
Thanks for coming.

14:26.550 --> 14:27.720
Thanks for coming.

14:27.750 --> 14:28.810
Thanks for coming.

14:28.810 --> 14:29.620
Thanks for coming.

14:29.620 --> 14:30.770
Thanks for coming.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.480
Put me in front of Gordon Gano.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.050
You are in front of Gordon Gano.

14:34.050 --> 14:36.950
Oh. Let me summon my magic within.

14:41.300 --> 14:43.010
Thanks for coming.

14:43.010 --> 14:44.320
Aren't you going to look at me?

14:44.320 --> 14:45.390
Do you have a question?

14:45.390 --> 14:46.370
Yes.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.740
Which do you prefer, stuffing or potato's?

14:52.160 --> 14:54.030
Is something wrong with your eyes?

14:54.030 --> 14:55.340
Should we help her out?

14:55.340 --> 14:57.340
A half-hour infatuation spell ought to work.

15:02.520 --> 15:05.110
Wow! You're fantastic!

15:05.110 --> 15:06.820
I must know your name?

15:06.820 --> 15:08.440
Libby Chessler.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.790
Can I play a song for you Libby Chessler?

15:10.790 --> 15:12.110
If you like.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.870
Guys let's do 'Please do not go'

15:14.870 --> 15:16.870
but I have a cramp in my hand.

15:16.870 --> 15:18.700
And we don't have our instruments.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.700
We'll use these!

15:20.870 --> 15:22.770
Come on, it's for Libby.

15:23.910 --> 15:25.690
One, two, three, four.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.790
This is so...

15:58.100 --> 15:59.220
Cool?

15:59.220 --> 16:00.810
Yeah cool!

16:04.320 --> 16:08.340
I wrote that for you even before I knew you existed.

16:08.810 --> 16:10.340
I thought so.

16:10.340 --> 16:12.340
Happy? The car is outside.

16:12.340 --> 16:13.830
We've gotta go.

16:13.830 --> 16:16.780
This can't be it! I just met you.

16:17.020 --> 16:20.300
Hey why don't you come hang with us at the Hotel courtesy suite?

16:20.300 --> 16:21.150
Would you?

16:21.150 --> 16:22.140
Would you?

16:22.140 --> 16:24.140
Sure, that sounds like fun.

16:24.140 --> 16:25.580
Great!

16:25.790 --> 16:28.220
We're at The Copley Plaza.

16:28.220 --> 16:30.200
Bring any friends you'd like.

16:30.540 --> 16:32.570
She said yes!

16:34.370 --> 16:37.390
It worked! It totally worked!

16:37.390 --> 16:39.990
I unleashed my magic within.

16:39.990 --> 16:42.410
And now we get to go party with The Violent Femmes!

16:42.450 --> 16:43.900
Not so fast.

16:43.900 --> 16:46.060
Gordon said I could bring anyone I wanted

16:46.060 --> 16:48.090
and I'm cool with you and the boys but...

16:48.090 --> 16:50.390
I'm afraid that doesn't include the Olson twins.

16:51.490 --> 16:52.730
What?

16:53.170 --> 16:55.370
But they came with us. We can't ditch them.

16:55.370 --> 16:56.560
They're no fun.

16:56.560 --> 17:00.420
All they did was whine, complain and talk about the Federal Reserve Board.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.720
Frankly they're an embarrassment.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.720
You owe them more than you think.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.099
I owe them nothing.

17:06.099 --> 17:07.300
You ate an egg!

17:07.300 --> 17:09.980
You're on the verge of cool here.

17:10.250 --> 17:11.619
Don't blow it.

17:11.619 --> 17:13.619
Now are you gonna dump 'em or not?

17:14.050 --> 17:15.630
No!

17:16.450 --> 17:19.520
Hillary and Zellary aren't just my relatives,

17:19.780 --> 17:22.410
they're my friends and if they don't go, I don't go.

17:22.910 --> 17:24.410
Come on Harvey, Gordie.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.599
If Sabrina's not goin', I'm not goin'

17:26.599 --> 17:29.180
And if Harvey's not goin' I'm not goin'

17:29.290 --> 17:32.230
Fine, more classic eighties rockers for me.

17:32.230 --> 17:34.830
I'll take a cab and go alone. See ya.

17:35.090 --> 17:37.370
We can't let her go alone. It's not safe.

17:37.370 --> 17:38.960
Someone has to go with her.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.590
Not Harvey; he's our ride.

17:40.730 --> 17:42.470
I've got it.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.800
Gordie, could you do me a favour?

17:47.100 --> 17:48.800
Anything.

17:54.350 --> 17:56.250
You could sit closer.

17:56.250 --> 17:57.790
Oh not tonight.

18:02.170 --> 18:04.490
Sabrina, can we talk?

18:04.490 --> 18:06.210
Now's not really a good time.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.640
Maybe next week.

18:08.060 --> 18:09.640
I feel awful.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.520
She was right.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.520
We do ruin everything.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.470
We've gotta make it up to her somehow.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.950
I know! W-We could...

18:18.950 --> 18:19.780
No.

18:20.190 --> 18:21.790
Or what if...?

18:21.790 --> 18:24.690
Wait. First I've gotta get out of this body.

18:24.690 --> 18:27.290
Me too. After you.

18:28.380 --> 18:29.840
Much better.

18:29.840 --> 18:30.830
My turn.

18:32.110 --> 18:33.590
I'll say.

18:39.690 --> 18:41.200
Can we come in?

18:41.200 --> 18:42.440
I suppose.

18:42.440 --> 18:45.340
Oh good. You're back to what passes for normal.

18:45.340 --> 18:47.940
Look, we're really sorry we embarressed you.

18:47.940 --> 18:50.310
And we feel we owe you some fun.

18:50.410 --> 18:51.770
So!

18:53.890 --> 18:55.370
I get to clean the house?

18:55.940 --> 18:58.240
No, you get to fly.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.350
On a vacuum?

18:59.350 --> 19:02.220
Yes. See old time witches used broom-sticks

19:02.220 --> 19:04.870
but vacuums are much faster and more efficient.

19:04.870 --> 19:08.090
You're gonna let me fly? I don't believe this.

19:08.090 --> 19:10.990
It's true. You proved tonight that you can handle the responsibility.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.190
And we were very impressed by the way you refused to buckle to peer-pressure.

19:14.190 --> 19:15.820
And most importantly,

19:15.820 --> 19:17.820
you called us your friends.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.550
Stop, you're embarrassing me.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.260
Is the bag inflated?

19:27.260 --> 19:27.700
Check!

19:27.700 --> 19:29.700
Are you set for low shag?

19:29.700 --> 19:30.590
Check!

19:30.590 --> 19:32.590
Then you're all ready for lift off.

19:34.610 --> 19:37.580
Now keep your hands at twelve and six.

19:37.580 --> 19:38.830
Don't flood it.

19:38.830 --> 19:40.360
I wont! I wont!

19:40.910 --> 19:41.720
She's up!

19:41.720 --> 19:42.830
I'm up!

19:43.540 --> 19:44.820
This is great!

19:45.310 --> 19:48.000
Wait! You forgot to tell me how to land!

19:48.700 --> 19:50.960
Just use the magic within.

19:59.950 --> 20:03.130
I'm flying and cleaning the air at the same time.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.640
I think I'll buzz the Copley Plaza.

20:22.810 --> 20:26.010
I thought we were gonna party, not watch stupid cartoons?

20:26.010 --> 20:28.310
Shhh! I missed what Ren said.

20:28.590 --> 20:31.040
He's going to the Muddy Mudskipper show.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.040
I've seen this one three times.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.040
Yeah it really holds up doesn't it.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.940
I can't believe this is what you guys do for fun.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.460
Don't you wanna play more songs for me Gordon?

20:40.460 --> 20:41.800
Not really.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.340
Are you sure?

20:44.820 --> 20:47.320
Maybe you should have your eyes checked.

20:47.840 --> 20:50.470
My reserves must be depleted.

20:50.470 --> 20:52.090
Come on Gordie. Lets go home.

20:52.090 --> 20:53.960
Oh in a second. This is my favourite part.

20:53.960 --> 20:54.620
Mine too!

20:54.620 --> 20:56.620
Gordie, you're the coolest.

20:57.220 --> 20:58.960
Unbelievable.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.080
Oh. Maybe I do need to get my eyes checked.

21:10.220 --> 21:12.260
I can see my house from here.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.160
Hey!

21:18.160 --> 21:20.490
Hello Sabrina. How was school?

21:20.490 --> 21:21.430
Fine.

21:21.430 --> 21:22.730
How's Harvey?

21:22.730 --> 21:23.900
Oh he's got a bit of a cold.

21:23.900 --> 21:24.810
And Libby?

21:24.810 --> 21:26.460
Unfortunately she's great.

21:26.460 --> 21:28.660
She wont stop talking about the Violent Femmes.

21:28.660 --> 21:30.510
So everyone's fine?

21:30.510 --> 21:32.060
Everyone?

21:32.060 --> 21:34.270
You know you can ask about Gordie if you want.

21:34.270 --> 21:36.590
Well did he say anything about me?

21:36.590 --> 21:38.750
I m-I-I mean Zellary?

21:38.750 --> 21:40.750
Yeah! As a matter of fact he did.

21:40.750 --> 21:41.790
Really! What?

21:41.790 --> 21:43.750
Let me make sure I get every word exactly right.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.100
He said

21:45.100 --> 21:47.400
'Tell her I want my scarf back.'

21:48.305 --> 21:54.606
