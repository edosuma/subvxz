00:22.500 --> 00:25.625


00:57.041 --> 01:00.458


01:15.500 --> 01:19.208
Boys!
Our favorite radio show is about to start!

01:19.291 --> 01:21.000
-Hey!

01:21.583 --> 01:24.333
You're not playing
with my lucky tire again, are ya?

01:24.416 --> 01:27.041
Of course not, dearest Kettle.

01:27.125 --> 01:30.083
-Hmm…
<i>Live from beautiful Inkwell City…</i>

01:30.166 --> 01:31.000
Phew!

01:31.083 --> 01:35.791

02:05.375 --> 02:08.125
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Let's jump right in!</i>

02:08.208 --> 02:13.791
Who will be the first lucky contestant
to Roll the Dice?

02:13.875 --> 02:16.000
-Will it be…
-Oh, me!

02:17.666 --> 02:18.791
You!

02:18.875 --> 02:20.833
-Yay!
-All right, Telephone!

02:20.916 --> 02:25.375
It's your lucky day, sir.
Get on up here and Roll the Dice.

02:26.208 --> 02:27.250
Ah, ah, ah!

02:27.333 --> 02:28.625
Don't touch.

02:28.708 --> 02:31.750
Now, all you gotta do
is make it through three rounds,

02:31.833 --> 02:35.208
then you get to enter
the mystery prize room.

02:36.916 --> 02:39.958
First up, Name That Tune!

02:42.875 --> 02:44.291
Ah! "Little Brown Jug."

02:44.375 --> 02:45.875
-Correct!

02:47.208 --> 02:50.500
Now, on to the trivia round!

02:50.583 --> 02:54.166
Which is the only mammal that cannot jump?

02:54.666 --> 02:56.000
Hmm…

02:56.083 --> 02:56.958
The elephant.

02:57.041 --> 02:59.000
-Correct!

02:59.083 --> 03:00.625
-Yeah!

03:01.208 --> 03:02.375
Show-offs.

03:03.375 --> 03:08.250
Now, for the final game.
All you gotta do is Roll the Dice!

03:08.333 --> 03:12.083
Roll any number
and you'll go to the mystery prize room.

03:15.541 --> 03:16.458
Oh, oh…

03:19.750 --> 03:21.916
We have a winner!

03:24.041 --> 03:26.458
You are one lucky phone!

03:26.541 --> 03:30.083
Now, off you go to the mystery prize room!

03:31.041 --> 03:32.250
We'll be right back.

03:33.666 --> 03:34.666
Hello?

03:41.041 --> 03:41.875
Uh-oh.

04:10.416 --> 04:13.208
Who's the host with the most, hmm?

04:13.291 --> 04:15.916
You are, you handsome devil. Mwah!

04:16.000 --> 04:18.375
Oh! You're terrible!

04:18.875 --> 04:22.375
<i>Now, we return</i>
<i>to your favorite radio game show,</i>

04:22.458 --> 04:24.333
Roll the Dice<i>!</i>

04:25.833 --> 04:29.083
Who will be our next lucky contestant?

04:32.708 --> 04:36.250
You! You're the next
contestant on <i>Roll the Dice</i>!

04:41.791 --> 04:46.750
Welcome to the show! Now, let go of my leg
and tell us a little bit about yourself.

04:50.125 --> 04:52.250
I'm Cuphead!
I like roller coasters, hot dogs,

04:52.333 --> 04:54.708
tilt-a-whirl, hot dogs,
flying swings, hot dogs,

04:54.791 --> 04:57.041
throwing up
and roller coasters in that order!

04:57.125 --> 04:59.916
What a lovely introduction. I--

05:00.000 --> 05:04.500
Wow! I can't believe
I'm standing next to <i>the </i>King Dice!

05:04.583 --> 05:07.458
You're way shorter in person.

05:09.625 --> 05:11.041
-So--
-Wait.

05:11.125 --> 05:13.375
Everyone in town can hear this, right?

05:13.458 --> 05:14.791
That's right. First--

05:16.291 --> 05:19.666
That's for you, Jimmy!
And you know what for.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.708
So, you're an entertainer, right?

05:23.791 --> 05:26.333
I'm kind of entertaining too.
I got a joke for you.

05:26.416 --> 05:31.083
These two cannibals are eating a clown,
and, uh… Wait. How did it go?

05:31.166 --> 05:32.208
Uh…

05:32.291 --> 05:33.375
Wait.

05:47.041 --> 05:49.583
Now, a quick word from our sponsor.

05:49.666 --> 05:51.000
We'll be right back.

05:51.083 --> 05:53.666


05:54.416 --> 05:56.000
Get me the boss.

05:58.583 --> 06:00.916
Uh, hey, boss. Phone call.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.458
Urgh. This better be important.

06:03.958 --> 06:05.666
It's your number one calling.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.416
Who?

06:07.500 --> 06:09.416
King Dice? Your number one?

06:09.500 --> 06:12.583
Dice, you know I'm very busy.
What do you want?

06:12.666 --> 06:15.625
I just captured someone
you might be interested in.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.791
A certain… cup?

06:17.500 --> 06:18.916
You actually have him?

06:19.000 --> 06:23.416
Just sit back, relax,
and I'll deliver his soul directly to you.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.875
This is why you're my number one.

06:25.958 --> 06:29.041
-Oh, and number one?
-Yes?

06:29.125 --> 06:31.791
I hate disappointment.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.250
And we're back!

06:39.333 --> 06:41.833
First up, you need to--

06:41.916 --> 06:44.083
Name That Tune!

06:52.583 --> 06:55.000
Oh, that's too easy. It's…

06:55.750 --> 06:57.458
Wait. I know this.

06:57.583 --> 06:58.958
Hmm…

06:59.041 --> 07:01.583
"Sprinkle, Sprinkle, Mr. Car"?

07:02.083 --> 07:04.666
"Sprinkle, Sprinkle, Mr. Car"?!

07:04.750 --> 07:06.333
Come on!

07:06.416 --> 07:07.625
-No.
-Aw.

07:07.708 --> 07:10.000
Hmm, then I better use my help line.

07:10.083 --> 07:13.250
My brother, Mugman,
is the smartest person I know.

07:15.083 --> 07:18.166
It appears
your help line is frozen in terror.

07:19.333 --> 07:23.166
Oh, right.
Mugman's got really bad stage fright.

07:23.250 --> 07:24.375
Aw, nuts!

07:24.458 --> 07:25.791
I guess I lose.

07:28.750 --> 07:32.916
Since your help line was frozen in terror,
you should get another chance.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.291
Shouldn't he, folks?

07:34.375 --> 07:36.500
-Give him another chance!

07:36.583 --> 07:38.750
What's the name of your favorite song?

07:38.833 --> 07:40.916
-Beautiful.

07:43.958 --> 07:47.083
Okay, Cuphead. Name this tune.

07:50.708 --> 07:52.958
But you just asked me my favorite song.

07:53.041 --> 07:54.458
Which song?

07:54.541 --> 07:57.458
"The Daring Young Man
on the Flying Trapeze"?

07:57.541 --> 07:59.000
-Correct!

07:59.500 --> 08:01.291
Yay!

08:01.375 --> 08:02.625
And now, on to the--

08:02.708 --> 08:04.625
Trivia round!

08:04.708 --> 08:06.625
Isn't he great, folks?

08:06.708 --> 08:11.625
Now, the dreaded Poodoo Cave Monster
lives in which cave?

08:13.125 --> 08:14.125
Hmm…

08:17.041 --> 08:21.375
The "Poodoo Cave" Monster.
Let's just think out loud a little.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.500
Say the name of the cave monster.

08:23.583 --> 08:24.416
Poodoo?

08:24.500 --> 08:25.666
Correct!

08:28.375 --> 08:30.375
Now, it's time to Roll the Dice!

08:30.458 --> 08:33.250
Roll any number and go straight
to the mystery prize room.

08:33.333 --> 08:36.708
Literally, any number.
It's basically impossible to lose.

08:37.333 --> 08:39.666
Then I'll get what's coming to me!

08:39.750 --> 08:42.458
Couldn't have said it better myself.

08:55.833 --> 08:58.625
Wait! I remember how the joke goes!

08:58.708 --> 09:00.708
Two cannibals are
hanging out eating lunch,

09:00.791 --> 09:03.500
which is a clown, see?
'Cause they're cannibals.

09:03.583 --> 09:07.375
One cannibal says to the other,
"Does this taste funny to you?"

09:08.875 --> 09:10.416
We'll be right back.

09:11.708 --> 09:13.791
No! We are not going to break!

09:15.458 --> 09:16.750
Roll the Dice!

09:16.833 --> 09:22.500
Roll the Dice! Roll the Dice!

09:22.583 --> 09:23.666
Watch this.

09:34.500 --> 09:35.958
How?

09:36.041 --> 09:38.333
Aw, dang it. I guess I lost.

09:39.125 --> 09:41.750
Oh, that's actually a good thing.

09:41.833 --> 09:45.750
When the dice shatter, you go directly
to the mystery prize room, yay!

09:45.833 --> 09:46.666
In you go.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.666
Hey! He lost!

09:48.750 --> 09:50.708
He's not supposed to get a prize.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.833
This show is rigged!

09:52.916 --> 09:55.541
-Shut up! Get in there!

09:55.625 --> 09:56.750
Boo!

09:56.833 --> 09:58.291
Rigged? Hmph!

10:00.208 --> 10:03.708
Come on, Mugsy.
Let's leave with our dignity intact.

10:04.208 --> 10:07.208
No! You have to win!

10:09.458 --> 10:13.000
You're going in that room
one way or another.

10:23.916 --> 10:26.416
Uh, Boss wants to see ya.

10:30.708 --> 10:31.541


10:33.208 --> 10:36.541
It's "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"!

10:39.416 --> 10:43.958
Uh, gee, Mr. King Dice, sir,
I know this is a little bit awkward,

10:44.041 --> 10:47.250
but, um, could I get your autograph?

10:47.333 --> 10:49.291
Not the time.

10:51.666 --> 10:52.791
Hey-hey!

10:52.875 --> 10:53.833
Oh, um…

10:55.541 --> 10:57.333
You're way over there.

11:00.041 --> 11:03.208
Done some redecorating, I see.

11:03.291 --> 11:04.166
Uh…

11:04.750 --> 11:05.625
Say, um, how--

11:05.708 --> 11:09.166
So, Dice, you know Henchman, don't you?

11:10.583 --> 11:12.000
Hi!

11:12.500 --> 11:13.875
Yeah. I know Henchman.

11:13.958 --> 11:17.958
He's a big fan of your show.
Never misses an episode.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.875
Is… is that a fact?

11:20.958 --> 11:25.166
He was telling me that tonight,
you had your first loss. Ever.

11:25.250 --> 11:27.333
Look, I can explain!

11:27.416 --> 11:28.375
Silence!

11:30.625 --> 11:31.458
Huh?

11:32.458 --> 11:35.916
You had him
right in the palm of your hand!

11:36.708 --> 11:40.333
I am very, <i>very </i>disappointed!

11:40.416 --> 11:42.625
Give a second chance to your number one!

11:45.875 --> 11:48.291
You are no longer my number one.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.958
And you will not be hosting
your precious little show.

11:52.041 --> 11:55.333
But if I'm not hosting, then who?

11:56.250 --> 12:00.541
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>
<i>Tonight's master of ceremonies,</i>

12:00.625 --> 12:03.791
<i>the Henchman!</i>

12:03.875 --> 12:06.500
Uh, hi!

12:06.583 --> 12:08.291
Time to Roll the D--

12:08.375 --> 12:09.208
Whoa!
