23:16.996 --> 23:19.597
   ¶<i> It's the lonely road I'm</i>
           <i> traveling</i>

23:19.799 --> 23:22.433
    ¶<i> I'm past a broken man.</i>

23:22.969 --> 23:28.506
¶<i> Heading for destruction with a</i>
      <i> curse upon my head.</i>

23:28.975 --> 23:36.547
¶<i> Faith has got me now and it's</i>
      <i> time for me to fly.</i>

23:39.886 --> 23:46.824
 ¶<i> Faith has got me now and no</i>
      <i> time to say goodbye.</i>

23:51.531 --> 23:57.968
      ¶<i> Daisy, you'll see.</i>

24:02.942 --> 24:09.079
      ¶<i> Daisy, you'll see.</i>

24:11.851 --> 24:17.588
¶<i> It doesn't matter the road I'm</i>
           <i> running...</i>

24:19.559 --> 24:22.760
  ¶<i> ...or the way the wind is</i>
          <i> blowing,...</i>

            (Daniel)
     <i> So there I was, at the</i>
         <i> crossroads...</i>

24:34.674 --> 24:38.609
            (Daniel)
 <i> ...with a broken car, a crazy</i>
             <i> uncle...</i>

24:39.579 --> 24:41.645
            (Daniel)
<i>...and her name in every song I</i>
             <i> heard.</i>

24:43.115 --> 24:46.684
            (Daniel)
<i>Standing on the edge, with only</i>
         <i> one way to go...</i>

26:04.230 --> 26:05.062
              Hey!

26:07.567 --> 26:09.934
 So, what's in the bag? Did you
          bring lunch?

26:11.070 --> 26:15.072
  Funny you should ask. Let's
             walk.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.277
 So, how did you like our demo?

26:20.613 --> 26:22.012
       I loved your demo.

26:22.682 --> 26:24.615
 But what I really loved is the
            lyrics.

26:25.952 --> 26:27.117
       They're so poetic.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.019
 It's because they are for you.

26:30.122 --> 26:30.955
            For me?

26:32.191 --> 26:33.157
          I'm serious.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.659
 Everything I do is because of
              you.

26:39.065 --> 26:41.765
  But it wasn't till right now
 that I was man enough to tell
              you.

26:45.738 --> 26:46.337
              No!

26:48.841 --> 26:49.873
       What's the matter?

26:55.348 --> 26:56.880
  Daniel, I can't be with you.

26:59.752 --> 27:02.786
I can't have you sacrifice your
  life for the sake of saving
             mine.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.723
Do you even love this other guy?

27:07.827 --> 27:09.226
       It just happened.

27:09.762 --> 27:11.028
So, then I'll take care of you.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.330
 I'll take care of you and the
             baby.

27:13.331 --> 27:15.331
  We'll get married and we'll
 start our own lives together.

27:16.669 --> 27:17.668
         I have to go.

27:19.739 --> 27:20.638
           I'm sorry.

27:59.812 --> 28:00.377
              Hey!

28:02.782 --> 28:03.380
      What are you doing?

28:07.053 --> 28:08.252
   Didn't you read then sign?

28:08.721 --> 28:09.953
 Your uncle is looking for you.

28:10.122 --> 28:10.821
            Thanks.

28:11.157 --> 28:11.922
           [Whistle]

28:13.059 --> 28:13.924
          ¡Cabroncito!

28:14.226 --> 28:14.925
   Step away from the ledge.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.064
      What are you doing?

28:21.834 --> 28:22.433
        Who's that girl?

28:22.835 --> 28:23.400
           What girl?

28:23.402 --> 28:25.069
 The girl you sent to come get
              me.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.106
I'm worried you might be getting
          sun stroke.

28:31.877 --> 28:35.913
   Lucky for you we have the
 perfect remedy for that in the
              car.

28:58.370 --> 28:59.870
        That is amazing!

28:59.872 --> 29:04.441
 I told you!<i> Newsweek</i> says it's
one of the best places to eat in
        the whole world.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.075
       That was awesome!

31:19.178 --> 31:20.510
     Give me some dollars.

31:21.213 --> 31:21.979
              Why?

31:21.981 --> 31:24.615
Because I got the food, you get
           the music.

31:30.623 --> 31:31.989
    I don't have any money!

31:33.392 --> 31:34.324
              Run!

31:36.128 --> 31:37.261
      The car is that way!

31:41.533 --> 31:44.101
You guys are great! Really good!

31:59.051 --> 32:01.952
You know I'm really glad we got
         to do this...

32:02.588 --> 32:06.590
  ...you and me,<i> partiendo la</i>
             <i> Baja.</i>

32:07.226 --> 32:08.292
         Me too, uncle.

32:08.294 --> 32:12.629
 You keep your eyes on the road
 because the fog, see, it could
            be bad.

32:13.198 --> 32:14.564
 We'll just stop and pull over.

32:14.566 --> 32:17.134
  No, no, you don;t want to do
             that.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.001
            Why not?

32:18.003 --> 32:21.238
Because there could be <i> bandidos</i>
         on this road.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.274
    So, then we won't stop.

32:24.276 --> 32:30.213
Exactly.  If you see someone on
  this road trying to make you
        stop, you don't!

32:31.450 --> 32:35.519
  As a matter of fact, you aim
well and step on it all the way.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.355
    You mean, run them over?

32:38.557 --> 32:39.623
             Yeah!

32:39.625 --> 32:42.526
But what if they have like a gun
         or something?

32:45.230 --> 32:47.631
 Then you step on it and duck!

32:56.275 --> 32:58.075
Hey uncle, can you tell me about
          my grandpa?

33:02.448 --> 33:04.081
     I don't remember much.

33:06.251 --> 33:09.553
He loved music- that's where you
     got your passion from.

33:09.555 --> 33:14.758
He used to bring out his guitar
 and he'd make me and your mom
          sing to him.

33:17.429 --> 33:20.063
   You know, she had the most
        beautiful voice.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.268
  Try and keep the car steady,
            alright?

33:25.571 --> 33:26.403
      What are you doing?

33:26.538 --> 33:27.471
         I need to pee.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.539
Alright. So, we'll pull over...

33:29.541 --> 33:31.308
 No, I can do it in the bottle
          just try...

33:31.310 --> 33:33.610
No! You are not doing it in the
            bottle!

33:33.612 --> 33:35.412
           Oh, gosh!

33:35.614 --> 33:38.749
 [Sound of bottle being filled]

33:40.452 --> 33:41.284
          Hey uncle...

33:42.087 --> 33:43.120
             Hmmm.

33:44.156 --> 33:45.322
What did you say about <i> bandidos</i>

33:46.258 --> 33:48.091
I don't know. I don't remember.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.359
              Why?

33:49.795 --> 33:52.462
Cuz these guys want us to stop.

33:53.699 --> 33:55.432
       No! Stop the car!

33:55.434 --> 33:56.266
      Are these <i> bandidos</i> ?

33:56.268 --> 33:58.301
No, they are worse! They are
<i>bandidos</i> with a license!

33:58.303 --> 33:59.136
           Hurry up!

34:00.606 --> 34:04.341
Listen to me.  Whatever happens
you let me do the talking, okay?

34:12.618 --> 34:13.483
             Hola!

34:57.830 --> 34:59.096
No.

34:59.865 --> 35:00.630
No.

35:29.495 --> 35:30.560
          My cookies!

35:30.562 --> 35:34.331
  Don't push it! Okay? We are
   lucky they didn't take our
           <i> calzones</i> .

35:34.333 --> 35:35.298
      Just get in the car!

35:55.254 --> 35:57.521
           (Rodrigo)
 Tell me again about this girl.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.823
          Who? Daisy?

35:59.825 --> 36:01.158
       Is that her name?

36:01.160 --> 36:02.259
             Yeah.

36:02.260 --> 36:03.359
So, yeah.  Tell me about Daisy.

36:06.231 --> 36:09.166
We kind of grew up together and
   she lived next door to me.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.802
   We always had this amazing
          connection.

36:15.474 --> 36:19.176
You wouldn't believe her poetry.
I mean, she is the best writer I
           ever read.

36:20.612 --> 36:21.745
          Is she hot?

36:21.947 --> 36:22.746
             What?

36:23.415 --> 36:24.648
          You know...

36:24.650 --> 36:26.783
Are you...? Oh, come on! Really?

36:26.785 --> 36:27.517
             What?

36:30.189 --> 36:31.888
     She's a <i> gringa</i> , yeah?

36:32.491 --> 36:33.356
             Yeah.

36:33.358 --> 36:36.660
 You better watch out for those
        American girls.

36:37.496 --> 36:41.364
They'll rip your heart and throw
it in the trash like a piece of
          rotten meat.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.400
 Why? Did you ever have to deal
       with a heartbreak?

36:43.402 --> 36:45.502
            Oh yeah!

36:45.504 --> 36:48.738
But let me tell you something.
The difference between American
    women and Latin women...

36:49.608 --> 36:52.742
 ...American women, they'll rip
       out your heart,...

36:53.579 --> 36:57.380
...but Latin women...they'll rip
        out your <i> huevos</i> !

36:59.218 --> 36:59.783
           Comprende?

37:05.357 --> 37:09.492
The fog is getting really thick
     and I'm getting pretty
tired...we must have passed the
             hotel.

37:09.494 --> 37:12.462
 I already told you, we haven't
 passed it. Just keep driving!

37:12.464 --> 37:15.765
  If you want to drive, be my
 guest, cause I need a bed now!

37:15.767 --> 37:17.834
Well, that's why we have to find
           the hotel.

37:18.237 --> 37:19.669
You said you knew where it was!

37:19.671 --> 37:21.705
Well, this fog is confusing me,
            alright?

37:21.707 --> 37:24.608
 Just pull over and we'll wait
        for it to clear!

37:59.044 --> 38:00.343
    Are you ready to go eat?

38:00.345 --> 38:04.014
 We should probably head out...
     the fog is probably...

38:11.757 --> 38:13.723
  You've got to be kidding me!

38:15.494 --> 38:18.928
  I'm such an idiot! What am I
          doing here?

38:27.639 --> 38:28.805
          Buenos días.

38:30.375 --> 38:31.074
          Sleep well?

38:31.075 --> 38:31.774
      I slept in the car.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.643
   Oh, I slept in the hotel.

38:35.447 --> 38:36.513
   Why didn't you wake me up?

38:36.515 --> 38:39.015
Because you were sleeping like a
baby. I didn't want to wake you
              up.

38:40.619 --> 38:41.652
Help me put these in the car...

38:41.653 --> 38:42.686
No, I have to make a phone call!

38:46.558 --> 38:47.424
          [Dial tone]

38:54.066 --> 38:55.699
       ¿Cómo se dice... ?

38:56.335 --> 38:58.368
   ...collect call...Estados
           Unidos...

39:01.606 --> 39:03.573
  The United States. I need to
make a phone call to the United
            States.

39:32.738 --> 39:33.636
         Hey, uncle...

39:36.375 --> 39:38.141
   You know I've never seen a
       picture of my mom.

39:41.113 --> 39:42.846
    Did you guys look alike?

39:44.116 --> 39:44.948
              No.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.451
     No, she was beautiful.

39:49.488 --> 39:52.455
   I inherited the more macho
   rugged looks of my father.

39:57.996 --> 40:00.497
 You never finished telling me
          how he died.

40:05.570 --> 40:09.572
           (Rodrigo)
  <i> One day we went swimming. He</i>
     <i> dove into the water...</i>

40:11.143 --> 40:15.078
...he didn't know a week before
 they dumped cement pylons into
           the ocean.

40:17.048 --> 40:18.181
       He broke his neck.

40:20.552 --> 40:21.851
       He died instantly.

40:24.790 --> 40:29.492
 Can you imagine being 12 years
  old and having to drag your
father's body out of the water?

40:29.961 --> 40:31.628
  <i> We got him to the bed of his</i>
            <i> truck...</i>

40:33.432 --> 40:34.764
  <i> ...drove him to the ranch...</i>

40:35.767 --> 40:37.801
...haven't moved it ever since.

40:39.471 --> 40:40.603
       I'm sorry, uncle.

40:51.016 --> 40:52.482
     I'm having a déjà vu.

42:33.552 --> 42:35.752
This guy isn't going to screw us
          over, is he?

42:37.022 --> 42:38.855
  Not if you don't give me no
            reason.

42:38.857 --> 42:40.089
       You speak English?

42:40.258 --> 42:41.324
   I'm from Huntington Beach.

42:42.127 --> 42:43.560
  What are you doing out here?

42:43.562 --> 42:47.330
 Look, let's just say that the
   less you know, the better.

42:48.700 --> 42:50.633
  There's something we have to
   worry about, isn't there?

42:52.971 --> 42:54.170
     I'm messing with you!

42:54.339 --> 42:55.138
            Really?

42:57.842 --> 43:01.144
 Okay. I swallowed some condoms
        full of drugs...

43:01.146 --> 43:04.047
...that I have to crap out, but
 that's not till we get there.

43:04.783 --> 43:06.082
   What? Are you kidding me?

43:06.084 --> 43:11.321
You know, you guys are okay. The
 minute I get there, you're off
           the hook.

43:13.091 --> 43:14.857
  You're not serious, are you?

43:15.794 --> 43:17.126
     Nah, messing with you!

43:20.765 --> 43:24.067
  I think you were telling the
  truth. I mean, why would the
   Federales just let us go?

43:24.970 --> 43:27.604
 Drunk driving is the least of
         their worries.

43:28.106 --> 43:30.340
Of course, if you really, really
        want to know...

43:30.342 --> 43:34.310
 ...you can always cut me open
   and find out, if you dare.

43:37.949 --> 43:39.782
      Come on, gentlemen.

43:39.784 --> 43:50.293
This here is for our protection
   and the protection of our
          merchandise.

43:50.295 --> 43:54.030

            saying,

01:18:49.325 --> 01:18:52.126
 but I just thought he had hurt
              her.

01:18:52.128 --> 01:18:55.096
    So, before she could say
   anything, I just went out
        looking for him.

01:18:56.399 --> 01:19:01.368
  Because anyone that hurts my
     sister, is my enemy...

01:19:02.472 --> 01:19:04.305
...even if he is my best friend.

01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:34.368
    Everyone said it was an
          accident...

01:19:37.406 --> 01:19:39.073
     ... but I killed him.

01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:57.091
The families thought it was best
       not to tell her...

01:19:58.394 --> 01:20:01.428
...till after you were born, so
  they just said he ran away.

01:20:04.567 --> 01:20:07.868
Your grandmother took us to the
 United States so you could be
          born there.

01:20:09.505 --> 01:20:11.505
      At first. during the
          pregnancy...

01:20:14.243 --> 01:20:16.277
  ...things went surprisingly
             well.

01:20:18.514 --> 01:20:20.848
 She loved you so much, Daniel.

01:20:29.192 --> 01:20:30.457
     After you were born...

01:20:32.161 --> 01:20:33.828
 ...she became very depressed.

01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:37.898
   She couldn't handle it...

01:20:40.503 --> 01:20:43.871
 ...and one day she just walked
     out into the ocean...

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:48.175
  ...and she never came back.

01:20:52.982 --> 01:20:54.615
       I'm sorry, Daniel.

01:21:00.122 --> 01:21:01.856
     I can't take all this.

01:21:02.859 --> 01:21:04.158
    I just want to go home.

01:21:05.461 --> 01:21:06.510
           Daniel...

01:21:06.511 --> 01:21:07.560
   I just want to see Daisy.

01:21:08.297 --> 01:21:10.264
   I can't take this anymore
            either.

01:21:10.266 --> 01:21:11.565
   Why did you bring me here?

01:21:13.069 --> 01:21:13.701
           I'm sorry.

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:14.334
 I didn't ask for any of this.

01:21:14.337 --> 01:21:16.120
           I'm sorry.

01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:17.904
I didn't ask to be brought into
      the world like this.

01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:20.608
 I just want to go back to her.

01:21:21.611 --> 01:21:23.477
  Please, just let me go home.

01:21:41.564 --> 01:21:42.563
