00:19.603 --> 00:20.896
Damn.

00:32.991 --> 00:36.495
There's ash in the wine
from the fires in Malibu Canyon.

00:40.582 --> 00:43.001
You can almost see
from here.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.906
I want you to know I...
I don't do this.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.659
I mean, I'm not
one of those guys...

01:15.701 --> 01:18.954
that sends his family
on vacation just so he can...

01:19.580 --> 01:23.125
- But when I met you
at the corporate party, I...
- Shh.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.213
It'll be worth it.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.472
I'll do things with you
no one's ever done.

02:42.473 --> 02:46.073
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 07 - 3

05:13.355 --> 05:16.608
- Let's start in the bedroom
and work our way downstairs.
- Okay.

05:16.650 --> 05:20.779
- Don't let the media in on the
writings in blood on the wall.
- Okay.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.491
Excuse me, sir,

05:25.075 --> 05:28.412
if I can ask your indulgence,
this is a restricted crime scene.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.414
Agent Mulder.
I'm with the Bureau.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.416
- Nobody called the Bureau.
- They should have.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.543
Look, L.A.P.D. has seen...
I don't know, what...

05:34.585 --> 05:36.545
maybe a couple of weird
crime scenes down the years.

05:36.587 --> 05:39.756
- I think we can handle things.
- There's no time for rivalries.

05:39.798 --> 05:43.385
I don't care about credit for the arrest
or what goes on whose record.

05:43.427 --> 05:47.764
In the past year,
these killers have murdered six people.
They only kill at night.

05:47.806 --> 05:51.059
By the end of the week, two more people
will be dead, and they will be gone.

05:51.101 --> 05:54.229
- Just how do you know all this?
- There's a file on the murders.

05:54.271 --> 05:58.275
I've studied it. I've been waiting
three months for them to reappear.

05:58.317 --> 06:01.278
Just how can you be sure that
these are the same killers?

06:01.320 --> 06:04.114
The wire reported a body
was found drained of blood,

06:04.156 --> 06:07.576
bite marks on the exterior jugular
and median cubital veins.

06:07.618 --> 06:09.912
Every mirror in the house
was smashed.

06:09.953 --> 06:14.166
Yeah, well, it's what the wire didn't
report that distinguishes this scene.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.920
There's writings on the wall...
written in the victim's blood.

06:18.003 --> 06:22.341
"He who eats of my flesh and drinks
of my blood shall have eternal life...

06:22.591 --> 06:25.469
and I will raise them up
on the last day".

06:25.511 --> 06:28.555
They have the same feeble
literal grasp of the Bible...

06:28.597 --> 06:31.183
as all those big-haired
preachers do.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.602
The victim,
was he a father?

06:33.852 --> 06:36.897
Yeah, three boys.
The family's been notified.

06:37.523 --> 06:40.442
In Memphis they murdered
James Ellis, 58,

06:42.277 --> 06:44.780
the father of
Ellis and Sons Clothiers.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.950
The second victim
was a Korean woman, Linda Sun.

06:48.325 --> 06:51.662
The third victim was
a Jesuit theologian. Excuse me.

06:52.079 --> 06:55.791
In Portland, three months ago,
the first victim was a priest.

06:56.875 --> 07:00.254
The second victim was the only
son in a family of six children.

07:00.295 --> 07:03.465
The last victim was the owner
of a New Age bookshop,

07:03.507 --> 07:05.300
the Holy Spirit.

07:06.260 --> 07:10.556
I believe that's how they perceive
themselves as a kind of unholy trinity.

07:11.431 --> 07:15.853
They use these to extract the blood,
and then store it for a quick fix later.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.397
Their need is insatiable,

07:18.564 --> 07:21.567
but murdering for blood
risks exposure and capture.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.736
If my profile of the previous
cases holds true,

07:24.820 --> 07:27.990
they've been living in the city
and working near blood products
for the past month.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.950
Look, Agent Mulder...

07:29.992 --> 07:32.202
Look, I'm really sorry I was
such a hard-ass back there,

07:32.244 --> 07:35.581
but in this town, it's
really tough to trust anyone.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.083
Truth is, I'd be happy to have
You work on our investigation.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.503
- Now, this is Detective Gwynn...
- I'm working alone.

07:41.837 --> 07:44.339
An FBI agent
without a partner?

07:45.424 --> 07:48.385
Look, Mulder, our department's
under a crisis alert now...

07:48.427 --> 07:50.512
because of the fires
in the canyon.

07:50.554 --> 07:53.891
The fact is, I don't think I can free up
any resources for you right now.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.934
I only need one thing.

08:00.439 --> 08:03.483
- Hollywood Blood Bank.

08:03.525 --> 08:06.278
Yeah, hi. This is Marty Mulder
from your payroll service.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.698
I have a question regarding
the W-4 form of a recent employee.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.576
- You mean Frank?
- When was he hired?

08:13.118 --> 08:16.121
A couple weeks ago.
He's the night watchman.

08:51.532 --> 08:54.493
- Hey! Easy, man. Easy.
- Federal agent!

08:56.537 --> 08:59.414
Sorry, man.
I didn't know you was there.

08:59.915 --> 09:03.961
Damn freak night watchman down there
always breakin' the lightbulbs.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.677
I'll wait up stairs.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.776
Federal agent!
Freeze!

10:26.043 --> 10:28.545
Turn off the lights!
Turn 'em off!

10:28.587 --> 10:31.632
You're killing me.
Turn 'em off! Turn 'em off.

10:32.841 --> 10:35.844
- Tell us your real name.
- I can't take it.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.849
Turn off the lights!
You're killing me. Turn them off!

10:43.560 --> 10:44.978
Please!

10:45.771 --> 10:48.190
Turn off the lights!
Please.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.818
Turn them off!

10:55.364 --> 10:57.074
That better?

11:24.268 --> 11:26.353
I'll only talk to him.

11:32.568 --> 11:34.152
Lucky you.

11:46.665 --> 11:48.667
You know what we are.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.419
What are you?

11:53.797 --> 11:57.509
He is the father, I am the son
and she is the unholy spirit.

11:58.010 --> 12:00.929
And the three of you
killed Garrett Lorre.

12:01.847 --> 12:03.015
No.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.518
Your fingerprints were found
at the crime scene.
- No!

12:06.935 --> 12:10.272
When a snake eats a fly,
it's not murder. It just is.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.734
Frogs eat flies.

12:13.859 --> 12:16.236
- Are you dead?

12:19.281 --> 12:22.242
- I never will be.
- Do you believe that?

12:26.163 --> 12:28.582
Don't you
wanna live forever?

12:31.585 --> 12:34.713
Not if draw string pants
come back into style.

12:36.298 --> 12:39.051
Look, what nobody
realizes is that...

12:40.427 --> 12:42.429
there is no after life!

12:42.471 --> 12:44.431
I know this...
Listen to me. Listen to me.

12:44.473 --> 12:48.227
I know this because when we prolong
our lives by taking theirs,

12:49.686 --> 12:52.147
all I see is such...
horror....

12:53.357 --> 12:55.067
in their eyes.

12:55.526 --> 12:58.612
That's because at that moment,
they're face to face with death.

12:58.654 --> 13:01.740
And suddenly they realize
there's nothing else.

13:02.074 --> 13:04.743
There's no heaven.
There's no soul.

13:05.244 --> 13:08.205
There's just rot,
and there's just decay.

13:09.039 --> 13:12.459
And I will never, ever, ever,
ever have to face that.

13:13.752 --> 13:16.004
It's a stiff price, though.
Look at yourself,

13:16.046 --> 13:19.967
drinking blood, living in darkness,
unable to see your reflection.

13:20.676 --> 13:22.803
Or is that just a myth?

13:27.266 --> 13:29.560
I can't be seen in a mirror.

13:32.563 --> 13:35.607
Look... anything worth
anything has a price.

13:38.277 --> 13:41.238
When I'm standing
next to your deathbed...

13:41.280 --> 13:43.949
looking as young
as I look right now,

13:44.950 --> 13:47.619
and I see that fear
in your eyes...

13:47.953 --> 13:50.080
at the moment of death,

13:50.539 --> 13:53.542
then... then tell me
the price is too stiff.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.965
It's more likely I'll
be looking into your eyes...

14:00.007 --> 14:03.427
at the moment before they
lead you into the gas chamber.

14:07.931 --> 14:11.602
But that's a moment
you won't have to face
if you tell me where the others are.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.312
Why would I?

14:14.146 --> 14:16.106
They're the only ones
that can kill me.

14:16.148 --> 14:18.901
Well, if you are
what you say you are,

14:19.651 --> 14:21.862
I know what can kill you.

14:25.991 --> 14:28.994
It would be very easy
to cover those windows.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.788
Just tell me where
the other two are.

14:35.375 --> 14:39.046
In a couple of hours,
there will be no escaping the sun, son.

14:48.597 --> 14:51.850
If he wants to talk,
cover the windows and call me.

14:52.309 --> 14:55.646
What if he turns into a bat
and flies out through the bars?

14:55.687 --> 14:58.106
That man is clearly delusional,

14:58.565 --> 15:01.151
but I get the sense that not
even he believes his own claims.

15:01.193 --> 15:03.070
For now, we've gotta play
along with his beliefs.

15:03.111 --> 15:06.365
I'm hoping that the sunlight
will give him an excuse to talk.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.367
Why don't you go back to your hotel
and get some sleep?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.911
I didn't check into
a hotel room.

15:11.954 --> 15:14.039
I don't sleep anymore.

15:48.282 --> 15:51.493
Number four right away!
Number four right away!

16:10.304 --> 16:12.556
An edemaballat thenostrils,

16:12.598 --> 16:15.893
rupture of the skull
due to internal steam pressure...

16:15.934 --> 16:19.646
These are indications of long exposure
to extreme temperatures,

16:20.063 --> 16:22.274
not sunburn for 15 seconds.

16:22.357 --> 16:25.235
The guards found
no flammable materials?

16:26.278 --> 16:28.322
I had believed that...

16:29.865 --> 16:32.618
this man's illness
was psychological.

16:32.701 --> 16:35.287
There is a condition
known as Gunther's Disease.

16:35.329 --> 16:39.541
congenital erythropoietic porphyria
creating cutaneous photo sensitivity.

16:40.292 --> 16:44.046
I'm familiar with porphyria.
It's an affliction that causes
lesions and blisters...

16:44.087 --> 16:47.132
when skin is exposed to sunlight,
not fourth-degree burns.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.426
Sufferers may have
ahema deficiency...

16:49.468 --> 16:51.929
which can be supplemented
by a small ingestion of blood,

16:51.970 --> 16:55.098
not the kind of blood thirst
that this man had.

16:55.516 --> 16:58.685
It's probably ignorance
of porphyria as a disease...

16:58.727 --> 17:02.731
that led to the creation of vampire
myths in Asia in the Middle Ages.

17:03.232 --> 17:05.858
I had dismissed
the possibility...

17:06.234 --> 17:09.530
of the actual existence
of such a creature as myth.

17:09.613 --> 17:12.866
You are really upsetting me...
on several levels.

17:16.078 --> 17:19.580
- When will you get
the blood tests back?
- Next week.

17:22.626 --> 17:25.127
What's this
purple stain here?

17:26.964 --> 17:30.133
Could be an ink stamp,
like they give at a party or a club.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.010
Can you read it?

17:32.511 --> 17:35.848
It is possible that the heat
burned the ink permanently...

17:35.889 --> 17:38.475
into the lower levels
of the skin.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.953
An old coroner's trick.

17:57.995 --> 18:01.206
I can make a quarter appear
from behind your ear.

19:01.683 --> 19:06.230
Are you about to ask
what a normal person like me
is doing in a place like this?

19:10.442 --> 19:12.653
How do you define normal?

19:14.029 --> 19:15.822
Misha, red wine.

19:18.784 --> 19:20.827
I don't.
How do you?

19:24.456 --> 19:27.334
All I know is
normal is not what I feel.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.343
You've lost someone.

19:39.888 --> 19:41.974
Not a lover,
a friend.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.729
I'll get these.

19:58.657 --> 20:00.659
"He who drinks my blood..."

20:00.701 --> 20:03.412
- "Has eternal life".

20:08.876 --> 20:13.172
- You're not interested
in this place, in what we do.
- How do you know?

20:13.380 --> 20:15.340
You're afraid of me.

20:17.968 --> 20:20.262
I take the life of others...

20:21.263 --> 20:22.890
inside me...

20:24.183 --> 20:25.893
into my blood.

20:29.605 --> 20:31.356
I need to know.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.611
All day long
I deal with equity,

21:19.363 --> 21:21.031
notes, bonds,

21:22.866 --> 21:24.826
nothing that's real.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.871
And this gives
my life... life.

21:48.100 --> 21:50.894
My name's Kristen.
It's a normal name.

22:00.445 --> 22:01.822
AIDS.

22:03.073 --> 22:04.992
Aren't you afraid?

22:11.373 --> 22:13.917
I wish I could die.

23:19.691 --> 23:21.735
The father.
The sun.

24:12.536 --> 24:16.456
I don't know who you are, freak,
but we're two consenting adults.

24:17.207 --> 24:19.626
Now, get the hell
outta here.

24:30.137 --> 24:31.638
Kristen?

24:37.853 --> 24:39.354
Kristen!

24:42.524 --> 24:43.984
Kristen.

24:46.570 --> 24:48.071
Come out.

24:48.947 --> 24:50.240
Hmm.

24:52.618 --> 24:54.286
It's my turn.

25:05.964 --> 25:08.717
Don't worry.
I took care of that guy.

25:11.845 --> 25:14.139
I told you I'd protect you.

25:32.991 --> 25:37.746
The murderers cut off
the power supply at some point,
and the phone. Fits their M.O.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.458
Agent Mulder, this is our forensic
dentist you requested, Dr.Jacobs.

25:41.500 --> 25:43.210
How do you do?

25:43.460 --> 25:46.630
I don't want to bias your report,
but I need a preliminary examination...

25:46.672 --> 25:48.715
for anything unnatural.

25:49.299 --> 25:50.759
Uh-huh.

25:53.971 --> 25:56.223
Shine the light down here.

26:44.104 --> 26:45.731
Agent Mulder.

26:49.234 --> 26:52.905
All this time I've been
putting raspberry sauce on ice cream.

26:53.197 --> 26:55.199
Check these prints immediately.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.993
One will be the victim's, the other
should be the woman we're looking for.

26:58.035 --> 26:59.369
Right.

27:09.296 --> 27:12.299
Well, the bites are not done
by an animal. These are human.

27:12.341 --> 27:14.968
And realize this is
a cursory exam,

27:15.135 --> 27:18.555
but I'd say they were made
by three different people.

28:02.599 --> 28:04.476
The unholy spirit.

28:10.399 --> 28:12.776
- We've got the front.
You go around the back.
- Uh-huh.

28:12.818 --> 28:14.862
You, check the garage.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.452
Okay, do it.
Open her up.

28:29.042 --> 28:32.004
Miss Kilar?
Los Angeles Police Department.

28:33.088 --> 28:36.008
We have a warrant
to search the premises.

28:56.570 --> 28:59.198
I found these,
veterinary needles.

28:59.698 --> 29:03.452
The size matches the puncture
wounds on the previous victims.

29:04.453 --> 29:07.164
And look at this.
This is from a snakebite kit.

29:07.206 --> 29:09.333
It's placed over the wound
to extract poison.

29:09.374 --> 29:11.251
- Only this one...
- Has blood in it.

29:11.293 --> 29:13.337
Detective?
Over here.

29:32.814 --> 29:35.901
Well, she wasn't at work,
and she's not here.

29:37.402 --> 29:40.197
She's gone,
and she's not coming back.

30:10.477 --> 30:12.646
Special Agent Fox Mulder,

30:13.063 --> 30:15.566
Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

30:17.609 --> 30:19.486
They're after you.

30:20.112 --> 30:21.947
How do you know?

30:22.114 --> 30:25.367
The bread, legends in
Eastern European countries.

30:25.909 --> 30:30.205
It said that one can protect one's self
by eating bread filled with blood.

30:30.372 --> 30:32.749
You were protecting
yourself.

30:38.088 --> 30:40.549
And now you're
protecting me?

30:40.591 --> 30:44.094
I think it's best if I took you
into protective custody.

30:45.596 --> 30:48.724
They'll kill once more.
They'll try to kill you,

30:48.765 --> 30:50.017
Hmm.

30:50.893 --> 30:52.978
Why are you here alone?

30:56.565 --> 30:59.276
Because you think
you're not afraid?

31:02.821 --> 31:05.032
Because you need to know?

31:06.033 --> 31:08.535
You need to know they are
who they believe they are.

31:08.577 --> 31:10.746
What I believe you to be.

31:23.217 --> 31:26.845
One change in the wind,
and the fires will move this way.

31:28.931 --> 31:31.183
Have you ever tasted blood?

31:34.561 --> 31:36.355
No, you haven't.

31:38.482 --> 31:40.651
Blood tastes... dangerous.

31:43.737 --> 31:45.864
It's sweet... and thick.

31:50.077 --> 31:53.997
You were in Memphis and Portland
when the other murders occurred.

31:54.873 --> 31:56.917
How are you connected?

32:01.922 --> 32:04.967
When I was a little girl,
my father beat me.

32:08.595 --> 32:10.848
Abuse is too frail a word.

32:13.433 --> 32:16.270
He showed his love for me
by beating me.

32:16.770 --> 32:18.313
I was dead.

32:21.525 --> 32:23.610
One night he hit me
so hard,

32:23.652 --> 32:26.864
he knocked out two teeth
and locked me in my room.

32:30.284 --> 32:33.453
The blood poured from my mouth
onto the floor...

32:34.663 --> 32:36.582
and down my throat.

32:38.959 --> 32:41.795
It was the only way
I knew I was alive.

32:45.174 --> 32:47.217
I met John in Chicago.

32:49.553 --> 32:51.889
You know him
as the "son".

32:55.684 --> 32:57.519
He also beat me.

32:57.686 --> 33:00.606
I guess that's the way
it works sometimes.

33:07.154 --> 33:09.781
He hit me once
and cut open my lip.

33:12.367 --> 33:14.036
I was angry,

33:14.369 --> 33:17.998
and as revenge, I jumped on him
and I bit through his lip.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.169
He tasted my blood,

33:23.795 --> 33:25.672
and I tasted his.

33:29.468 --> 33:32.221
After that,
we were into blood sports.

33:33.597 --> 33:34.973
But...

33:37.309 --> 33:38.810
I never...

33:42.356 --> 33:43.941
I lost him.

33:46.443 --> 33:49.363
One night he came home
with two others...

33:49.738 --> 33:51.532
and it turned...

33:52.491 --> 33:54.076
unnatural.

33:58.163 --> 34:00.541
I left him,
and I moved to Memphis.

34:00.582 --> 34:02.626
But they followed you.

34:03.460 --> 34:05.170
They want you.

34:05.462 --> 34:07.464
I'm tired of running.

34:10.384 --> 34:12.844
And you're here
to protect me.

34:20.768 --> 34:23.230
Are you trying
to ward me off?

34:27.442 --> 34:29.610
It's from someone I lost.

34:30.529 --> 34:32.739
Well, I hope you find her.

34:36.326 --> 34:38.786
The one you lost,
John, he's...

34:39.036 --> 34:40.371
dead.

34:42.416 --> 34:45.752
But they've picked up another.
They're three again.

34:45.918 --> 34:50.465
Kristen, I think you'll be safer if you
come back to the police station with me.

34:52.759 --> 34:54.928
Without him,
they won't come for me.

34:54.969 --> 34:56.554
I won't go.

34:58.098 --> 34:59.933
Then I won't go.

35:03.020 --> 35:05.272
You need to get cleaned up.

35:18.452 --> 35:20.495
- Yeah?

35:23.832 --> 35:25.417
No mirrors.

35:27.544 --> 35:29.546
I don't like the way I look.

35:29.588 --> 35:31.465
It makes this hard.

35:38.430 --> 35:40.015
I'll do it.

35:59.576 --> 36:00.869
Hmm.

36:18.804 --> 36:20.806
It's not who you are.

36:22.057 --> 36:24.268
It doesn't make you happy.

37:02.014 --> 37:03.974
I've been watching.

37:05.517 --> 37:07.352
I had to wait...

37:07.811 --> 37:09.646
for you to finish.

37:11.231 --> 37:13.567
I had to wait
to tell you...

37:14.443 --> 37:15.986
it's true.

37:17.070 --> 37:19.531
I was as surprised
as anybody.

37:24.036 --> 37:26.038
You can live forever.

37:29.625 --> 37:32.836
Everybody else just dies,
but we... we come back.

37:35.923 --> 37:37.925
The spirit showed me.

37:40.761 --> 37:42.888
And now she'll show you.

37:50.312 --> 37:53.065
We live in a
different world, Kristen.

37:54.024 --> 37:56.902
And nobody on the outside
can end my life.

37:56.944 --> 37:58.820
You can't kill me,

37:59.571 --> 38:01.532
but I can kill you.

38:06.411 --> 38:09.039
I know, Kristen,
what I did to you.

38:09.164 --> 38:10.666
It was...

38:12.376 --> 38:14.920
If I were to die,
I would certainly go to hell...

38:14.962 --> 38:16.672
for what I did.

38:17.673 --> 38:20.801
But I love you,
and I can at one for eternity.

38:25.597 --> 38:27.224
Kill him...

38:28.934 --> 38:31.019
and we'll be together.

38:31.562 --> 38:34.273
You've got to drink
the blood of his spirit.

38:34.314 --> 38:36.441
- But he's no...
- He is.

38:37.568 --> 38:39.903
A spirit is one who believes.

38:40.362 --> 38:42.489
He knows we're possible.

38:46.034 --> 38:49.246
You don't have much time
before the sun comes up.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.668
Cut him open,

38:56.003 --> 38:57.838
and we'll finish.

39:17.107 --> 39:19.484
- You have to go.

39:21.486 --> 39:23.697
- They here?
- The fire.

39:24.323 --> 39:27.284
- You have to go.
- My car's down the hill.

39:27.826 --> 39:29.995
Mine's in the garage.
The keys are in it.

39:30.037 --> 39:32.372
You have to get
your things.

39:33.665 --> 39:35.667
I'll be right there.

39:57.397 --> 39:59.149
He's not dead.

40:00.567 --> 40:02.736
John's alive.
I saw him.

40:06.740 --> 40:08.200
Come on.

41:47.341 --> 41:49.343
- You all right?
- I won't leave without him.

41:49.384 --> 41:50.802
I'll go.

42:37.891 --> 42:39.726
We will rise up!

42:40.644 --> 42:43.522
You can't kill us!
You're not one of us!

42:45.983 --> 42:47.734
But I will be.

42:55.158 --> 42:57.870
I'm tasting the blood
of a believer.

42:59.830 --> 43:02.207
But you haven't
taken a life.

43:13.218 --> 43:14.970
I'll take mine.

43:15.220 --> 43:18.599
Don't do that. Don't do that!
Don't, don't, don't!

43:19.725 --> 43:21.351
No, no, no!

43:50.964 --> 43:52.674
Agent Mulder.

43:56.678 --> 43:59.181
I'm sorry.
We found four bodies,

44:00.182 --> 44:01.725
all dead.

44:05.521 --> 44:08.524
- The remains?
- The fire was extremely hot.

44:09.942 --> 44:12.194
It's just ashes and bones.
