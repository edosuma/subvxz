WEBVTT

00:08.884 --> 00:10.760
He's got a temperature of 103.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.595
And why do we care?

00:12.721 --> 00:15.640
Because we're human beings.
It's what we do.

00:15.891 --> 00:18.101
He said he was at a luncheon meeting.

00:18.227 --> 00:19.560
You took his history?

00:19.687 --> 00:21.813
The guy looks like Harpo.
You should see him.

00:21.939 --> 00:24.982
You asked him what book
he's currently reading?

00:25.109 --> 00:27.360
It's hilarious
to watch him try and talk.

00:27.486 --> 00:29.487
I asked him anything I could think of.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.906
Favorite color. "Blwoo."

00:32.241 --> 00:35.118
Favorite dessert topping?

00:37.329 --> 00:41.749
Trust me. You never know what fact
may prove the key to saving your life.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.335
Whipped cream.

00:44.837 --> 00:47.922
- I asked him if he was sure.
- Where are you going?

00:48.048 --> 00:51.050
- You're an ass.
- I know. Where are you going?

00:51.176 --> 00:54.429
This is either a toxin,
an infection or an allergic reaction.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.889
I assume you gave him epi,
so that rules out allergies.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.225
Put him on antibiotics
in case it's an infection,

00:59.351 --> 01:01.728
and if it's a toxin,
we'll keep him here overnight,

01:01.854 --> 01:03.646
let the swelling go down, send him home.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.732
I'm going to the movies.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.693
Which one of you is House?

01:09.903 --> 01:11.696
Skinny brunette.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.948
No, that's Dr. Cameron.

01:15.159 --> 01:17.326
I'm skinny. How do you know her name?

01:17.453 --> 01:19.078
I was a patient of yours.

01:19.204 --> 01:22.790
Oh, well, if you wanna leave
the chocolates downstairs...

01:26.545 --> 01:28.588
Stay! Stay away from him.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.970
Shocking, isn't it?

01:36.889 --> 01:38.848
Who'd want to hurt you?

02:36.782 --> 02:38.407
You're pathetic.

02:42.204 --> 02:46.374
Judging by the growth, I'd say
I've been unconscious for two days.

02:47.251 --> 02:49.669
- You been sitting there the whole time?
- No.

02:50.212 --> 02:53.756
Judging by the oily buildup
in your hair, I'd say you're lying.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.384
I was scared. Pardon me for caring.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.762
Did I lose any organs?

02:59.888 --> 03:02.473
The bullet to your abdomen pierced
your stomach, nicked the bowel,

03:02.599 --> 03:04.267
lodged in the posterior rib.

03:04.393 --> 03:07.937
I always say if you're gonna get shot,
do it in a hospital.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.523
- The one in your neck...
- I don't remember that one.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.817
...went right through,
severed your jugular.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.194
- The shooter turns out to be a guy...
- Don't care.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.866
You don't care why a guy walked
into a hospital and shot a doctor?

03:19.992 --> 03:20.992
Shot you?

03:21.118 --> 03:23.077
I assume his reasoning was faulty.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.497
So what was it? Infection?

03:26.623 --> 03:28.624
The surgery went fine.
You've had no post-op...

03:28.750 --> 03:31.419
Not me. The patient. Harpo.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.463
You just got shot, House.
You should rest.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.133
I got shot. Diagnostically boring.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.929
Big fat tongue, on the other hand,
endlessly entertaining.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.098
We biopsied his tongue.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.017
And it was negative.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.353
And the blood tests were negative.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.022
I didn't say we did blood tests.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.649
You don't biopsy a tongue
unless you have to biopsy a tongue.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.234
And you don't have
to biopsy a tongue

03:55.360 --> 03:57.194
unless you've already come up
with nothing

03:57.321 --> 04:01.490
on a routine battery of tests which
don't involve torturing the patient.

04:01.617 --> 04:05.786
Any new symptoms other than
the increased intracranial pressure?

04:06.580 --> 04:09.290
Any guesses on how
I figured that one out?

04:12.544 --> 04:14.503
You knew the next step
would be a lumbar puncture.

04:14.630 --> 04:17.506
A lumbar puncture would almost certainly
give us a definitive answer.

04:17.633 --> 04:20.468
Since we don't have a definitive answer,
we must not have done an LP.

04:20.594 --> 04:25.306
And the most common reason to not do an
LP is increased intracranial pressure.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.561
He was shot by security trying to...

04:30.687 --> 04:32.605
House, what are you...

04:32.981 --> 04:34.231
House.

04:34.358 --> 04:35.358
I'm talking to Cuddy.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.611
Lie down. You've gotta be in pain.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.698
Not today. Today I'm on morphine.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.535
You're gonna rip your stitches out.

04:46.662 --> 04:47.912
Check Harpo's trash.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.538
Forget about the patient.

04:49.665 --> 04:52.166
Come on, you're curious.

04:52.501 --> 04:53.584
Trash?

04:53.710 --> 04:56.128
You don't know what I'm talking about,
but you know it's good.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.672
You can't just be walking around.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.798
Well, then stop me.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.675
- You've lost blood.
- Physically stop me.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.259
- You could damage...
- You can't.

05:02.386 --> 05:04.387
Because that would involve
physically touching me.

05:04.513 --> 05:07.515
And then things
would get so sexually charged...

05:13.313 --> 05:16.148
I'm twice your size.
Get your hands off me.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.319
Everything that lives, eats.
And everything that eats, poops.

05:20.445 --> 05:24.156
That's why every organ has a sanitation
department, the lymph system.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.243
Whatever's doing the damage
is dumping its waste in there.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.704
That's what you meant by trash.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.291
Biopsy the lymph node under the jaw.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.593
I'm sorry, I know it's crazy,
but there's no other place.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.721
It's the ICU.
It stands for Intensive Care.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.264
He needs intensive care.
So do you.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.807
He needs to be shot again.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.935
He is handcuffed to his bed. He is
sedated. He's not going to hurt you.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.353
If your security was any good,

05:54.479 --> 05:56.397
I wouldn't have been shot
in the first place.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.275
He is where he's supposed to be,
where you're supposed to be.

05:59.401 --> 06:00.443
Who did my surgery?

06:00.569 --> 06:02.528
Gillick. Why?
Are you gonna send him a fruit basket?

06:02.654 --> 06:03.779
He screwed up.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.866
It's annoying enough
dealing with your Vicodin habit.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.451
Quit upping your morphine.

06:08.577 --> 06:09.577
I'm not.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.205
I'm reducing it.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.834
And you're not in pain?

06:18.503 --> 06:19.754
I'm feeling better.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.381
Gillick is very good.
Your recovery time...

06:22.507 --> 06:25.301
This stomach kills me,
my neck is throbbing.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.386
My leg feels better.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.515
That's amazing.

06:31.641 --> 06:32.641
It's unbelievable.

06:32.768 --> 06:35.811
Since getting shot is not
an FDA-approved treatment for anything,

06:35.937 --> 06:38.606
it means something
must've gone wrong in the surgery.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.525
Yes, terribly, tragically wrong.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.652
Enjoy the mistake.

06:43.779 --> 06:47.198
He must have nicked something
in my peripheral nervous system.

06:47.324 --> 06:50.242
If it's alleviating pain,
who knows what else it's doing?

06:50.368 --> 06:53.370
Get back to the ICU
before you rip out your stitches,

06:53.497 --> 06:56.040
and I have to chain you to your bed.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.396
Why did you try to kill me?

07:21.900 --> 07:23.192
I didn't.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.278
Then the gun thing
might have been a mistake.

07:26.404 --> 07:29.115
If I'd have killed you,
it would have been over.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.992
I needed you to live,

07:33.787 --> 07:35.996
'cause I want to see you suffer.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.153
Get the needle out of there.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.531
He can't breathe.

08:18.748 --> 08:19.957
House.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.337
The test was negative.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.047
Are you sure you want to be doing this?

08:27.174 --> 08:28.883
I'm fine, I think.

08:29.301 --> 08:30.593
Cameron, have you got my records?

08:30.719 --> 08:32.928
They don't like to release
patient's operative notes.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.264
Yet you're holding them.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.765
And whispering.

08:36.892 --> 08:37.892
He's sleeping.

08:39.811 --> 08:42.688
Yeah, killer needs his rest.

08:42.814 --> 08:45.107
Otherwise, he's grumpy all day.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.067
Hey, wake up!

08:47.444 --> 08:48.861
Watch me save a life.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.988
Almost for sure
it's some sort of infection.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.948
We've got him
on broad-spectrum antibiotics,

08:53.074 --> 08:54.700
but it's not even slowing
the thing down.

08:54.826 --> 08:57.203
Unless we figure out
what type of infection, we can't treat.

08:57.329 --> 09:00.372
And we can't figure out
what type because we can't do an LP.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.874
Do an LP.

09:02.626 --> 09:05.461
See what I did there? Couldn't have
done that if you'd killed me.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.588
We'd have done an LP two days
ago if we could have,

09:07.714 --> 09:09.590
but that much pressure,
something's bound to...

09:09.716 --> 09:11.050
We would've done an LP two days ago

09:11.176 --> 09:13.636
if the risks hadn't so obviously
outweighed the benefits.

09:13.762 --> 09:17.473
We just cut a hole in his throat.
The equation has changed.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.644
Couldn't have put it better myself.

09:28.235 --> 09:33.072
Pressure is 120 milliliters,

09:33.198 --> 09:37.576
H2O, with small, visible excursions
related to respiration and pulse.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.328
Well within normal, that's good.

09:39.454 --> 09:40.579
No. That's weird.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.714
You wanna hear a story?

09:53.051 --> 09:54.551
I have a rule.

09:55.971 --> 09:58.180
People who shoot me forfeit the right...

09:58.306 --> 09:59.306
My wife was sick.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.185
None of the doctors
could figure out why.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.396
Oh, I know this story.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.608
She died.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.735
So you selected
one of her doctors to kill,

10:11.861 --> 10:14.113
because that would make
everything right again.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.573
No, she lived. You cured her.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.620
I'm truly sorry I did that.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.623
In the course of investigating
her illness,

10:24.749 --> 10:27.918
you convinced me
that everything was relevant.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.255
You needed the truth.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.467
I confessed to you
that I'd had an affair.

10:39.222 --> 10:42.641
But it turns out that it had nothing to
do with why she was sick.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.687
Genetic predisposition
to brain aneurysms.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.066
You told her that.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.779
You also told her about my affair.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.658
And you caught crap, she left you,

11:00.201 --> 11:01.827
and now I've got to pay

11:01.953 --> 11:05.664
because you couldn't keep
your little killer in your pants.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.959
She killed herself.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.866
What sort of a hospital has glass walls?

11:41.284 --> 11:42.868
That's my husband.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.287
Really?

11:45.413 --> 11:48.624
You thought I just liked watching people
get needles poked in the back?

11:48.750 --> 11:53.712
No. I figured a co-worker
or a sister, not wife.

11:54.839 --> 11:55.964
Why?

11:56.674 --> 12:00.260
Don't worry, it's not insulting.
At least not to you.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.725
You're satisfied by that answer?

12:06.851 --> 12:08.310
You're Dr. House, aren't you?

12:08.436 --> 12:10.020
You're not going to shoot me, are you?

12:10.146 --> 12:12.231
You treated a friend of mine.

12:12.357 --> 12:15.067
She told me you only talk to people
if you have to.

12:15.193 --> 12:19.238
And then you insult them, while
showing off how insightful you are.

12:19.656 --> 12:24.326
Sevens marry sevens,
nines marry nines, fours marry fours.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.370
Maybe there's some wiggle room

12:26.496 --> 12:29.706
if there's enough money
or somebody got pregnant.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.335
But you've got at least three points
on your husband,

12:33.461 --> 12:36.797
and your frock says
you didn't do it for the money,

12:36.923 --> 12:39.466
and your breasts say
that you haven't had any kids.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.553
So you figure my marriage
is a mathematical error?

12:42.679 --> 12:44.346
Numbers don't lie.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.308
We're having trouble finding out
what infection your husband has,

12:48.435 --> 12:50.978
and the most likely culprit is an STD.

12:51.104 --> 12:55.441
You want to know if I've had an affair
with someone closer to my integer,

12:55.567 --> 12:58.735
and I have to tell you the truth
or my husband will die.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.028
Is your friend single?

13:00.155 --> 13:04.450
No. And I've always been faithful.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.831
I would've bet money
something would go wrong.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.833
Let's rotate him back.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.880
He's bleeding into his ocular orbit.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.798
LP wouldn't do this.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.803
Lots of pressure behind.
Gotta relieve it.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.812
What's going on? What are they doing?

13:34.856 --> 13:36.273
I should go.

13:39.486 --> 13:43.030
I seem to have torn my stitches.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.963
You collapsed in the hall,
tore your stitches.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.883
I remember. I was there.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.635
How's your gut? It's hurting?

14:04.761 --> 14:06.887
You shoot the guy who sold her the gun?

14:07.013 --> 14:11.016
She locked herself in the garage,
and she started the car.

14:11.142 --> 14:14.561
You shoot the guy
who sold her the garage-door opener?

14:16.022 --> 14:17.189
You're an ass.

14:17.315 --> 14:20.359
Now that is a bold position to take
given that I shot you.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.277
The shooting just makes you an idiot.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.947
You're an ass because
you're trying to wrap it in the flag,

14:25.073 --> 14:26.198
like you did a good thing.

14:26.324 --> 14:27.658
You're an ass and a hypocrite.

14:27.784 --> 14:30.369
You don't believe in rules.
You do whatever you think is right.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.913
That's all I did.
You were my role model.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.415
Watch out,
you're getting crumbs on the flag.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.418
I didn't commit to honor her.
I didn't commit to never lie to her.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.421
If you'd kept your mouth shut, she'd be
alive, and you wouldn't be shot.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.382
If you'd kept your pistols
in your pants...

14:43.508 --> 14:46.009
It's my fault she's dead!

14:46.844 --> 14:48.220
I know it.

14:49.097 --> 14:52.849
But why can't you admit that
it's maybe just a little bit yours, too?

14:54.519 --> 14:58.397
That maybe it's not just medical
mistakes that screw things up.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.692
Here's how life works.

15:01.818 --> 15:07.447
You either get to ask for an apology,
or you get to shoot people. Not both.

15:10.702 --> 15:12.619
Infections don't make
your eyes pop out.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.372
We should get back.
You're supposed be chained to your bed.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.917
I'm not done eating. Got to be
some sort of bleeding disorder.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.753
This is really stupid.

15:23.423 --> 15:27.676
If my stitches pop out again,
I got three doctors to save me.

15:27.885 --> 15:31.888
Could be some sort of weakness
in the lining of the ocular veins.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.933
Okay, I'll be you guys.

15:35.226 --> 15:38.312
No way, mate,
too much blood to just be a vein.

15:38.563 --> 15:42.232
No way, Hizzy, if it
was an artery, he'd still be bleeding.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.776
Actually, he'd be dead.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.237
He could've had a granuloma
in his sinuses that bled,

15:47.363 --> 15:49.072
which could've been caused by Wegener's.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.450
You'd think the surgeon
would've noticed a giant growth

15:51.576 --> 15:53.201
while he was sticking
the eyeball back in.

15:53.328 --> 15:55.203
Tongue and eyes are sick,
what about the nose?

15:55.330 --> 15:57.122
It's right in between them.
Why isn't it sick?

15:57.248 --> 15:59.291
So it's not spreading.
It's got a common source.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.959
Which can only be what?

16:01.085 --> 16:03.211
The brain, except the CT was clean.

16:03.338 --> 16:05.172
Check the brain's trash.
See what it's hiding.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.757
The brain doesn't have a lymph system.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.634
I know. All its garbage just blows off,

16:08.760 --> 16:11.136
gets caught in the snow fence
by the side of the road.

16:11.262 --> 16:14.222
You're referring
to the blood-brain barrier.

16:14.599 --> 16:17.142
What else? Biopsy the barrier.

16:17.268 --> 16:19.978
Wouldn't it be safer
to make a few educated guesses first?

16:20.104 --> 16:22.064
Try some relatively safe treatments?

16:22.190 --> 16:25.442
Biopsy the barrier. But first, start him
on Mebendazole in case it's a worm.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.319
And Levofloxacin
in case it's an infection

16:27.445 --> 16:29.029
that slipped by the first antibiotic.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.531
And Azithromycin for STDs.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.745
I really don't think the wife
is the kind to be messing around.

16:38.414 --> 16:39.998
If I was married to her, I certainly...

16:40.124 --> 16:41.625
House.

16:41.751 --> 16:44.628
The patient isn't married.
He's a widower.

16:47.298 --> 16:51.385
Really, it's more helpful
if you do the prescribed rehab yourself.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.179
My body is fine.

16:54.806 --> 16:56.181
My mind, on the other hand...

16:56.307 --> 16:57.849
Maybe she was a girlfriend.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.060
Or maybe she was just trying
to jerk you around.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.396
I spoke to every one of the nurses
on that floor.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.855
The patient only had six visitors,

17:03.981 --> 17:06.400
two females, no babes.
His mother and his aunt.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.652
So they missed someone.
They're not security.

17:08.778 --> 17:12.030
My posse never saw her or me
talking on the other side of the glass.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.449
They were a little busy
trying to save the guy's life.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.160
There's only one possible conclusion.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.329
It was a hallucination.

17:20.623 --> 17:23.667
What does that look like to you?
Point six?

17:23.793 --> 17:24.751
Anesthesia?

17:24.877 --> 17:28.255
No. It's got to be six smudge.
Let's say you're right.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.842
It wouldn't be that uncommon after
a trauma, after that much blood loss.

17:31.968 --> 17:35.387
If my perceptions are compromised,
then my judgment is compromised.

17:35.513 --> 17:36.596
What if his wife told me

17:36.723 --> 17:39.599
that the patient just got bit
by a rabid Vietnamese leper?

17:39.726 --> 17:41.560
So pull yourself off the case.

17:41.686 --> 17:42.769
And the next case?

17:42.895 --> 17:44.896
You take two weeks, you recover.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.648
What if I don't?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.442
What if it wasn't the shooting?

17:48.568 --> 17:50.610
The guy who sees connections
between everything

17:50.737 --> 17:53.822
sees no connection between being shot
and minor brain disruptions?

17:53.948 --> 17:55.115
What if it was the surgery?

17:55.241 --> 17:58.285
What if it was the fact
that you tore out your stitches

17:58.411 --> 18:00.120
and lost two pints of blood?

18:02.373 --> 18:05.792
Why did Gillick give me ketamine
during my surgery?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.088
Working.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.214
We need to talk.

18:12.175 --> 18:14.718
Get back to the ICU. Who uncuffed you?

18:14.844 --> 18:17.554
Why would a surgeon administer ketamine?

18:18.139 --> 18:20.640
- Who showed you your surgical file?
- How do you know it's mine?

18:20.767 --> 18:24.102
Because your patient hasn't had surgery,
and you don't care about anybody else.

18:24.228 --> 18:27.481
My anesthesia was almost nonexistent,
and yet I wasn't awake.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.817
For some reason, somebody
decided to put me in a dissociative coma

18:30.943 --> 18:32.611
instead of just putting me out.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.279
There are plenty of reasons to use...

18:34.405 --> 18:38.366
Fine. I'll go beat the truth out
of my surgeon. Gillick, right?

18:46.292 --> 18:47.626
It worked.

18:52.298 --> 18:55.467
There's a clinic in Germany.
They've been treating chronic pain

18:55.593 --> 18:59.179
by inducing comas and letting the mind
basically reboot itself.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.182
There's about a 50% chance
your pain will come back,

19:02.308 --> 19:06.019
which of course means
there is a 50% chance that it won't.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.607
- You had no right.
- To heal you?

19:10.733 --> 19:11.942
You messed with my brain.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.693
Why are you so upset?

19:15.530 --> 19:18.532
Are you experiencing
any neurological symptoms?

19:18.658 --> 19:20.283
Dizziness, tremors, hallucinations?

19:20.409 --> 19:24.246
No. It's a point of principle.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.378
Test was negative.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.130
No trash against the fence.
Is your leg really better?

19:34.257 --> 19:36.216
Don't worry,
I'm sure something else is wrong.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.051
We did find blood.

19:38.261 --> 19:40.262
- On which side?
- The wrong side.

19:40.388 --> 19:41.555
First thing that makes sense.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.015
The wrong side's the wrong side.
It can't make sense.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.893
It'd mess with his brain,
wouldn't cause fever.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.645
He's been sleeping a lot lately.

19:48.771 --> 19:49.771
You worried?

19:50.773 --> 19:53.441
I marked a change of meds on his chart.

19:54.610 --> 19:58.029
Foreign object, body wants
to get rid of it, that causes the fever.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.322
Blood's a foreign object?

19:59.448 --> 20:00.949
In the brain lining it is.

20:01.075 --> 20:03.326
- Blood dyscrasia means cancer.
- Find it.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.287
- All the tests...
- Have been negative.

20:05.413 --> 20:08.290
What do you do
if your trashcans are full?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.001
You use your neighbor's trashcans.

20:11.127 --> 20:14.254
Except it's still light outside,
your neighbor will see you.

20:14.380 --> 20:18.008
So you go out the back way into an alley
and drop off your trash by their garage.

20:18.134 --> 20:21.177
We'll check the lymphatic system
in the chest.

20:21.304 --> 20:23.513
You got that from trashcans
in the alley?

20:23.639 --> 20:25.223
The saliva glands from the tongue

20:25.349 --> 20:27.601
are connected to the lymphatic system
in the lungs.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.270
It's the next lymphatic system over.

20:31.814 --> 20:32.981
Yeah.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.358
Go get lung lymph.

20:41.824 --> 20:43.658
How did he know that?

20:46.329 --> 20:49.080
I wouldn't have hired him
if he wasn't smart.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.373
Right.

20:52.043 --> 20:55.003
'Cause you have nothing
but respect for him.

20:56.505 --> 21:00.133
Maybe he knew the answer
because the question

21:01.636 --> 21:04.387
wasn't nearly as tricky as you thought.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.851
Maybe he's not getting smarter,

21:10.686 --> 21:12.228
you're getting dumber.

21:32.959 --> 21:36.878
You pretend to buck the system,
pretend to be a rebel.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.215
You claim to hate rules.

21:41.300 --> 21:45.095
But all you do is substitute
your own rules for society's.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.390
And it's a nice simple rule,

21:49.725 --> 21:53.269
tell the blunt, honest truth

21:54.188 --> 21:56.398
in the starkest, darkest way.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.442
And what will be, will be.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.404
What will be, should be.

22:04.031 --> 22:07.534
And everyone else is a coward.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.497
But you're wrong.

22:13.207 --> 22:16.251
It's not cowardly
to not call someone an idiot.

22:17.169 --> 22:20.714
People aren't tactful
or polite just because it's nice.

22:22.008 --> 22:26.469
They do it because
they got an ounce of humility.

22:30.933 --> 22:34.019
Because they know
that they will make mistakes,

22:34.937 --> 22:37.814
and they know that
their actions have consequences,

22:38.441 --> 22:43.111
and they know that those consequences
are their fault.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.624
Why do you want so bad
not to be human, House?

23:02.548 --> 23:03.965
No, he's awake.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.718
House, we need to talk to you.

23:06.844 --> 23:08.720
How the hell did you know I was awake?

23:08.846 --> 23:10.805
Your nostrils flare when you sleep.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.600
- No, they do not.
- Fine. I'm lying.

23:15.978 --> 23:17.687
- Test was negative.
- You knew?

23:17.813 --> 23:19.230
- Force of habit.
- Showed no cancer.

23:19.356 --> 23:20.774
No reason why he's got a fever of 103,

23:20.900 --> 23:23.026
and no reason why his tongue
won't fit in his mouth.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.028
He's post-op.
Chase is getting him up and around.

23:25.154 --> 23:28.364
It's important that you're up
ASAP after surgery.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.658
You think you can urinate?

23:38.959 --> 23:40.710
It's getting bigger!

23:42.505 --> 23:44.881
Are you getting aroused?

23:45.007 --> 23:46.966
No! Not that part!

23:47.093 --> 23:49.219
Oh, God, it hurts!

23:50.179 --> 23:51.846
It's not stopping!

23:55.226 --> 23:58.728
Surgeons found no evidence
of a burst artery.

23:58.854 --> 24:03.108
The blood had to come from somewhere,
you took a shower in it.

24:03.234 --> 24:04.317
Trauma?

24:04.443 --> 24:07.278
Do you think someone snuck in here
just to kick him in the jewels

24:07.404 --> 24:09.823
and poke out his eye
and swell up his tongue?

24:09.949 --> 24:10.990
Keep riding.

24:11.117 --> 24:14.494
I got a bet with my physio
that I can do 100 klicks by Friday.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.080
What about blood from the kidneys?

24:20.084 --> 24:23.253
Kidneys drain into the bladder,
which drains into the ureter.

24:23.379 --> 24:25.839
There's no way it would mess
with the scrotum.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.883
Yeah, basic human anatomy.

24:29.635 --> 24:32.887
Therefore, I think it's safe to assume
that the problem lies elsewhere.

24:33.013 --> 24:35.807
But given that this case doesn't make
any kind of sense whatsoever,

24:35.933 --> 24:37.725
maybe we should
even question the basics.

24:37.852 --> 24:39.227
Maybe he's not human?

24:39.353 --> 24:42.647
An anatomical defect would seem more
likely, but let's not rule that one out.

24:42.773 --> 24:45.859
Even more likely, he is human, his
anatomy is where it's supposed to be,

24:45.985 --> 24:47.652
but he has testicular cancer.

24:47.778 --> 24:48.987
We tested for cancer.

24:49.113 --> 24:50.989
We tested
the lymph system in his chest.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.448
Surgeons found no growths.

24:52.575 --> 24:55.076
Surgeon was trying
to put everything back where it was.

24:55.202 --> 24:56.494
They weren't doing an inventory.

24:56.620 --> 25:00.707
May have been lucky. You don't catch
testicular cancer early, it kills.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.376
- Probably eroded some vessel.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.211
The question is
why I didn't think of it.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.298
Well, eyes popping out
is a rather odd presentation.

25:08.424 --> 25:10.842
Sac blowing up, on the other hand...

25:10.968 --> 25:12.719
If you could think of
everything yourself,

25:12.845 --> 25:14.220
you wouldn't need a team to annoy.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.097
I screwed up some basic anatomy,

25:16.223 --> 25:20.268
and I missed connecting a testicular
explosion with a testicular problem.

25:20.394 --> 25:22.270
You think there's any way
I would've done that

25:22.396 --> 25:23.730
before Cuddy messed with my brain?

25:23.856 --> 25:25.732
She was trying to help you,
and it worked.

25:25.858 --> 25:29.068
Yeah, I can run like the wind,
but I can't think.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.696
And seeing as how I'm too old
to become a professional athlete,

25:31.822 --> 25:35.241
it looks to me as if
she screwed me over big time.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.622
You don't want a healthy leg.

25:40.748 --> 25:41.873
Oh, here we go.

25:41.999 --> 25:45.168
If you've got a good life, if you're
healthy, you've got no reason to bitch.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.629
- No reason to hate life.
- Here's the flaw in your argument.

25:47.755 --> 25:50.089
If I enjoy hating life,
I don't hate life, I enjoy it.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.383
I didn't say it was rational.

25:53.844 --> 25:55.929
HIV testing is 99% accurate,

25:56.055 --> 25:58.973
which means there are some people
who test positive,

25:59.099 --> 26:01.809
who live with their own impending doom
for months or years

26:01.936 --> 26:03.519
before finding out everything's okay.

26:03.646 --> 26:07.899
Weirdly, most of them don't react
with happiness, or even anger.

26:08.025 --> 26:09.567
They get depressed.

26:09.693 --> 26:10.944
Not because they wanted to die,

26:11.070 --> 26:13.571
but because they've defined themselves
by their disease.

26:13.697 --> 26:16.407
Suddenly what made them them
isn't real.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.660
I don't define myself by my leg.

26:18.786 --> 26:22.080
No. You have taken it one step further.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.750
The only way you could come
to terms with your disability

26:25.876 --> 26:29.420
was to somehow make it mean nothing.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.006
So you had to redefine everything.

26:32.716 --> 26:35.677
You have dismissed anything physical,

26:36.804 --> 26:40.723
anything not coldly,
calculatingly intellectual.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.934
Why are you protecting her?

26:47.398 --> 26:49.816
Because she's done nothing wrong.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.570
You're completely comfortable
with what she did to me?

26:54.697 --> 26:56.364
Yeah, I am. Yeah.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.910
You agonize over moral choices.

27:01.578 --> 27:03.871
You're not completely comfortable
with anything

27:03.998 --> 27:08.084
until you've taken days to get your head
around every possible side.

27:08.836 --> 27:11.170
I've known what she did for six hours.

27:11.297 --> 27:14.090
How come you're acting
like you've known for days?

27:15.926 --> 27:17.010
What do I have?

27:17.136 --> 27:18.928
- You're not sick.
- What do I have?

27:19.054 --> 27:20.138
You need to calm down!

27:20.264 --> 27:23.182
- I have my brain! That's it!
- We were trying to help you.

27:23.309 --> 27:26.144
Yeah, nobody tries to screw up,
they just do.

27:26.270 --> 27:28.730
You were out of control.
You were shooting morphine.

27:28.856 --> 27:30.815
I can make people better.

27:30.941 --> 27:33.234
And you two decide to trade that
for jogging shoes!

27:33.360 --> 27:36.029
If you're suffering from side-effects,
then we can look at that.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.780
You value the physical so much.

27:37.906 --> 27:40.783
Let me put this in terms
you can understand.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.332
You're unbelievable.

27:47.458 --> 27:49.834
Even when you're out of your mind
with anger and fear,

27:49.960 --> 27:52.378
you still couch it in logical terms.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.714
- Are you hallucinating?
- Yeah, I'm hallucinating.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.549
No, I mean right now.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.384
Are you hallucinating?

28:01.096 --> 28:05.016
- How did you know I was...
- You were yelling at me.

28:05.726 --> 28:08.394
- You were calling me Wilson.
- No.

28:09.438 --> 28:11.397
You're losing it, House.

28:11.982 --> 28:15.193
- I never call Wilson by his name.
- Yeah, right.

28:15.319 --> 28:18.029
Now the hallucinator is going to tell
the hallucinatee what happened.

28:18.155 --> 28:20.448
You're not the hallucinatee.
Wilson was the hallucinatee.

28:20.574 --> 28:22.825
You think maybe you're focusing
on the wrong thing here?

28:22.951 --> 28:26.871
Cuddy's office was the hallucinatee.
The bathroom was the hallucinatee.

28:26.997 --> 28:28.790
Bathroom. It figures.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.501
What figures?

28:32.753 --> 28:34.837
You wet your bed.

28:36.256 --> 28:37.507
Damn it.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.095
- Test was negative.
- No.

28:42.221 --> 28:45.223
AFP and beta HCG
say no testicular cancer.

28:45.349 --> 28:47.975
So, let's recap.
We've just ruled out everything,

28:48.102 --> 28:49.143
which doesn't make sense.

28:49.269 --> 28:51.729
So the answer has to be
something that doesn't make sense.

28:51.855 --> 28:54.482
Do a cystoscopy. Make sure he's human.

28:55.401 --> 28:58.403
- The test was negative.
- For him being human?

28:58.529 --> 29:00.363
Everything was right
where it's supposed to be.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.365
All the tubes go
where they're supposed to go.

29:02.491 --> 29:06.035
Most likely scenario,
some kind of bacterial prostatitis.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.925
Did you find out if his father hunched?

29:21.135 --> 29:23.428
His father have trouble peeing?

29:24.680 --> 29:27.014
His father have sex
with his own mother?

29:27.141 --> 29:30.852
If the answers to any of those questions
is yes, assume you're right.

29:30.978 --> 29:33.646
If the answers are no,
assume you're right,

29:33.772 --> 29:35.940
but biopsy some prostate lymphs
just to be sure.

29:36.066 --> 29:39.068
But then we'd have to
cut through his stomach,

29:39.194 --> 29:42.280
and since he's clearly got a bleeding
problem, this kind of surgery...

29:42.406 --> 29:44.824
He doesn't clearly have anything.

29:48.412 --> 29:49.996
How did I get here?

29:50.122 --> 29:52.790
What are you talking about?

29:53.375 --> 29:55.001
I was in the ICU,

29:56.753 --> 30:00.214
and then I was coming down
these stairs with you guys.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.925
What happened in between?

30:06.430 --> 30:08.806
I don't remember how I got here.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.696
I'm taking myself off my case.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.824
Your patient is in critical care.
He's had a fever unabated for two...

30:26.950 --> 30:28.659
I think I'm losing my mind.

30:30.204 --> 30:31.996
I'm having blackouts.

30:32.122 --> 30:34.957
- You said you weren't having any...
- I lied.

30:35.083 --> 30:38.169
If you are doing this to scare me,
you made your point.

30:38.295 --> 30:42.340
Next time you get shot, I promise
to only treat the bullet wounds.

30:42.466 --> 30:44.133
I'm off the case.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.558
Why did you jump up when I came in?

30:52.684 --> 30:55.645
I thought you were going
to attack me again.

30:56.230 --> 30:57.605
Again?

30:57.731 --> 30:59.315
Yeah, you were in my face.

31:00.150 --> 31:02.276
- No, I wasn't.
- You were...

31:02.778 --> 31:04.445
You came in here with Wilson and...

31:04.571 --> 31:06.822
- That was a hallucination.
- No, you...

31:06.949 --> 31:09.033
Which means this is a hallucination.

31:26.760 --> 31:29.637
How can I tell what's real
and what's not?

31:32.015 --> 31:35.560
Everything looks the same,
sounds the same,

31:36.979 --> 31:38.563
tastes the same.

31:41.942 --> 31:44.860
Seems like I'd be the last person
you'd want to ask.

31:44.987 --> 31:46.237
Why not?

31:46.530 --> 31:49.657
You're obviously not here.
I'm obviously not here.

31:49.783 --> 31:51.951
Which means
this is a creation of my mind,

31:52.077 --> 31:54.245
which means
I'm really just asking myself.

31:54.371 --> 31:57.915
If you're talking to yourself, that's
a lot of unnecessary explanation.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.126
Hey, I'm trying to work this out.

32:00.252 --> 32:03.504
That requires give and take,
even in my own mind.

32:04.506 --> 32:06.090
What was the question?

32:06.216 --> 32:08.342
How can I tell what's real?

32:08.760 --> 32:10.303
Does it matter?

32:11.555 --> 32:13.848
That doesn't sound like
something I'd ask.

32:13.974 --> 32:16.809
All right. Your concern is that
if you act in the real world

32:16.935 --> 32:20.688
based on information that's not real,
the results are impossible to foresee.

32:20.814 --> 32:21.897
With you so far.

32:22.024 --> 32:25.401
But information is incapable
of harm in and of itself.

32:25.527 --> 32:27.194
Ideas are neither good nor bad

32:27.738 --> 32:29.822
but merely as useful
as what we do with them.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.783
Only actions can cause harm.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.911
That sounds like me.

32:36.455 --> 32:40.082
So you do nothing.
You refrain from taking any actions.

32:42.085 --> 32:44.629
You continue to throw out your ideas
as you always would,

32:44.755 --> 32:46.964
but if they're based
on faulty assumptions,

32:47.090 --> 32:49.467
your team will point that out.

32:49.593 --> 32:52.511
They won't do anything
that could hurt him.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.266
So I trust my team?

32:58.810 --> 32:59.644
Test was negative.

32:59.853 --> 33:02.438
- No blood in the prostate.
- No structural abnormalities.

33:02.564 --> 33:05.900
If something doesn't make sense,
what does that mean?

33:07.778 --> 33:09.153
It's not rhetorical.

33:09.279 --> 33:13.324
I need your input on everything I ask,
no matter how obvious it might seem.

33:13.450 --> 33:15.493
It means you're wrong.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.495
It means one of your assumptions
is wrong.

33:17.621 --> 33:19.997
Because if something
doesn't make sense, it can't be real.

33:20.123 --> 33:21.248
So what are our assumptions?

33:21.375 --> 33:23.709
We don't have any.
We're just guessing and testing.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.169
We assume the tests are right.

33:25.295 --> 33:27.129
We've already re-done them. Twice.

33:27.255 --> 33:28.339
Let's go more basic.

33:28.465 --> 33:30.508
What's more basic than the test results?

33:30.634 --> 33:32.468
The tests themselves.

33:32.636 --> 33:34.512
What does a biopsy consist of?

33:34.638 --> 33:36.681
You take a sample.

33:36.807 --> 33:38.099
Define sample.

33:38.517 --> 33:42.061
It's a small representative piece
of whatever you think is the problem.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.605
You go down to the shore,
you fill a cup of water.

33:44.731 --> 33:47.400
It's got no fish in it.
Does that mean no fish in the ocean?

33:47.526 --> 33:48.818
We can do another biopsy.

33:48.944 --> 33:50.486
We could fill another cup of water.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.905
But we gotta dive in.
We got to see what's actually in there.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.824
We can't operate,
he's got a bleeding problem.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.575
We assume he's got a bleeding problem.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.328
Yeah, because he bled
from where he wasn't supposed to bleed,

33:59.454 --> 34:01.288
causing parts of his body to blow up.

34:01.415 --> 34:03.999
Assuming that crazy
assumption is correct,

34:04.126 --> 34:06.252
if we operate on him,
we'll kill him.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.714
What if we could find a way
to do this surgery

34:10.757 --> 34:13.551
without giving him more
than a paper cut?

34:14.052 --> 34:18.556
You want to let a robot operate on me?

34:18.682 --> 34:20.641
The technology is amazing.

34:20.767 --> 34:23.561
It magnifies everything 10 times.
It's 10 times the accuracy.

34:23.687 --> 34:25.938
No way. I want a person.

34:26.064 --> 34:28.774
- A person would be controlling...
- People suck.

34:29.901 --> 34:32.445
People have turned you from
a guy with a swollen tongue

34:32.571 --> 34:35.573
into a guy with one eye, one ball,
and a stapled-on face.

34:35.699 --> 34:39.076
If you want someone to hold you while
you cry yourself to sleep at night,

34:39.202 --> 34:40.953
choose warm and soft.

34:41.079 --> 34:44.582
You want someone to write you a poem,
pick the sensitive loner.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.709
If all you care about
is that something's done right,

34:46.835 --> 34:48.252
pick the guy with the metal head.

34:48.378 --> 34:50.629
- No way.
- No way, no way.

34:50.756 --> 34:53.758
You gotta see this thing in action
before you say no way. Come on.

34:53.884 --> 34:55.926
House, what are you doing?

34:57.262 --> 34:59.972
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.

35:00.348 --> 35:01.891
Just throwing out ideas.

35:02.017 --> 35:05.269
I think that you should put him in a
wheelchair and take him down to the OR.

35:05.395 --> 35:07.104
But I may be out of my mind.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.115
Relax, Cameron.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.618
I'm not going to cut you.

35:20.744 --> 35:23.537
I just wanna show
what this puppy can do.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.248
It can make one-millimeter incisions.

35:26.917 --> 35:29.001
You don't know how small that is?

35:29.127 --> 35:31.170
It's small even in metric.

35:31.797 --> 35:35.299
If I do something
that doesn't make sense, even to you,

35:36.176 --> 35:37.426
stop me.

35:48.063 --> 35:49.563
Delicate, no?

36:22.764 --> 36:23.973
House.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.267
Does that hurt?

36:31.314 --> 36:32.731
Seen enough.

36:34.484 --> 36:35.568
No.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.404
That wasn't a question.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.364
You either do this, or you die.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.745
You've wasted your life.

36:46.872 --> 36:47.872
Yeah.

36:49.082 --> 36:51.750
If only I'd spent more time
dedicating myself

36:51.877 --> 36:54.003
to finding someone worthy to shoot.

36:54.796 --> 36:56.922
If I had killed you,
would it have mattered?

36:57.048 --> 36:59.174
Not to me. Have you got a pen?

36:59.301 --> 37:01.093
You don't care if you live or die?

37:01.219 --> 37:04.722
I care because I live.
I can't care if I'm dead.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.683
I don't want to hear semantics.

37:07.809 --> 37:09.852
You anti-semantic bastard.

37:11.146 --> 37:13.689
Would anybody care
that the world lost that wit?

37:13.815 --> 37:14.940
Working here.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.443
That's all right.
You don't have to say anything.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.279
Just let me soak into your subconscious.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.241
You think that the only truth
that matters

37:24.367 --> 37:26.410
is the truth that can be measured.

37:26.870 --> 37:30.831
Good intentions don't count.
What's in your heart doesn't count.

37:31.458 --> 37:33.167
Caring doesn't count.

37:33.293 --> 37:35.419
But a man's life can be measured

37:35.545 --> 37:38.923
by how many tears are shed when he dies.

37:41.551 --> 37:44.094
Just because you can't measure them,

37:44.471 --> 37:47.431
just because you don't want
to measure them,

37:48.558 --> 37:50.684
doesn't mean it's not real.

37:55.357 --> 37:57.733
That does not make sense.

37:59.819 --> 38:03.614
And even if I'm wrong,
you're still miserable.

38:05.951 --> 38:08.494
Did you really think
that your life's purpose

38:08.620 --> 38:12.081
was to sacrifice yourself
and get nothing in return?

38:14.209 --> 38:15.292
No.

38:16.836 --> 38:20.839
You believe
there's no purpose to anything.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.802
Even the lives you save, you dismiss.

38:28.264 --> 38:30.432
You turn the one decent thing
in your life

38:30.558 --> 38:33.394
and you taint it,
strip it of all meaning.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.070
You're miserable for nothing.

38:45.031 --> 38:47.616
And I don't know why you'd want to live.

39:10.557 --> 39:11.932
I'm sorry.

39:25.905 --> 39:27.906
I know what's wrong.

39:32.454 --> 39:35.372
House, get out of here,
you're not sterile.

39:37.167 --> 39:38.834
He'll be fine.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.169
Great.

39:41.921 --> 39:43.630
What's he got?

39:43.757 --> 39:47.718
How come you guys have never tried
to yank me off this case?

39:48.678 --> 39:51.472
I'm having hallucinations, blackouts.

39:51.598 --> 39:55.601
But you're always insane,
and you're always right.

39:55.727 --> 39:58.812
I'm almost always eventually right.

40:00.023 --> 40:03.233
You have no way of knowing
when eventually is.

40:03.777 --> 40:06.737
Every time I've had an epiphany
on this one,

40:06.905 --> 40:09.073
you guys were right on board.

40:09.199 --> 40:11.658
No challenges, nothing to explain.

40:12.410 --> 40:16.288
No offense, but either you guys are
getting smarter or I'm getting dumber.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.457
We've worked with you long
enough to know...

40:18.583 --> 40:21.376
I know the test results
even before you enter the room.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.879
We have identical knowledge.

40:24.005 --> 40:25.047
How is that possible?

40:25.173 --> 40:26.131
You're wrong.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.258
If something doesn't make sense,

40:28.384 --> 40:30.594
one of your assumptions has to be wrong.

40:30.720 --> 40:33.972
Because if it doesn't make sense,
it can't be real.

40:34.224 --> 40:38.727
But what if the faulty assumption
is that it's real?

40:39.479 --> 40:41.814
House, you're losing it.

40:42.607 --> 40:44.108
I've lost it.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.071
Why did you stop me?

40:49.197 --> 40:51.323
Because I think
you're going to kill him.

40:51.449 --> 40:54.618
No, you don't think that. You know it.

40:55.745 --> 40:57.788
Because you're in my head.

40:58.081 --> 41:02.292
As long as the delusion makes sense,
my mind lets it go on.

41:02.418 --> 41:06.004
I have to make it not make sense.
I have to

41:06.131 --> 41:09.299
push it past the point
where it can trick my mind.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.803
If this is a nightmare,
you're gonna wake up.

41:12.929 --> 41:14.596
If it's real, you're killing a man.

41:14.722 --> 41:17.349
It's also possible
that I may already be dead.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.101
And I don't believe in the afterlife.

41:19.227 --> 41:20.936
House, go back to your room.

41:21.062 --> 41:23.021
If this is a hallucination,
it's a good one.

41:23.148 --> 41:24.606
You're pain-free.
You can walk.

41:24.732 --> 41:28.443
It's not real. Therefore,
it's meaningless. I want meaning.

42:12.822 --> 42:14.239
Oh, God.

42:47.190 --> 42:48.482
Goodbye.

42:49.776 --> 42:51.193
- He was shot.
- Twice.

42:51.319 --> 42:53.445
Once in the abdomen, once in the neck.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.155
- Hello.
- It's gonna be okay.

42:55.281 --> 42:56.782
You're gonna be okay.

42:56.908 --> 42:58.325
You don't know nothing.

42:59.285 --> 43:00.619
Tell Cuddy

43:02.455 --> 43:04.039
I want ketamine.
