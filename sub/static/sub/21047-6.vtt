WEBVTT

00:00.233 --> 00:04.069
<i>Previously on "Blood drive"...</i>

00:04.070 --> 00:07.439
<i>Than the uptight little Hamlet
of Meadeville?</i>

00:07.441 --> 00:10.175
So what, this is some sort
of sex plague?

00:10.177 --> 00:11.443
Arthur...
come on.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.479
<i>What the hell'd you do to me?</i>

00:13.481 --> 00:15.347
Christopher,
wherever you're keeping him,

00:15.349 --> 00:17.049
<i>he's a good cop too.</i>

00:17.051 --> 00:18.183
I knew you wouldn't
abandon me, buddy.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.785
<i>You got your boy on the inside.</i>

00:19.787 --> 00:22.354
Listen.
I want tits murdering dicks!

00:22.356 --> 00:24.556
Guys, "Blood drive's" getting
picked up.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.358
We got future episode outlines.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.127
<i>We got air dates.
Everything's here.</i>

00:28.129 --> 00:31.363
<i>Yes, I will take it down
to the hall of secrets.</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:33.165
<i>Karma was transferred
from Kane Hill</i>

00:33.167 --> 00:35.200
to the Claireview rehabilitation
center for women.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.436
I've rerouted the next leg
to take you right past it,

00:37.438 --> 00:40.372
but if you're the last one
across that finish line,

00:40.374 --> 00:42.241
rules still apply.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:59.193 --> 01:01.393
We only have one shot at this.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.395
We gotta race balls out,
build up an early lead

01:03.397 --> 01:05.397
so we have enough time.
Great.

01:05.399 --> 01:08.233
So we find Claireview
and bust Karma out of there

01:08.235 --> 01:09.568
and haul ass
across the finish line

01:09.570 --> 01:11.403
before our heads explode.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.306
- Pretty solid exposition.
- Oh, eat me, Barbie.

01:15.810 --> 01:18.310
So, um...

01:18.312 --> 01:20.512
About last night.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.514
I mean, with us.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.284
I was under the influence.

01:25.286 --> 01:28.320
So I just don't want things
to get, you know,

01:28.322 --> 01:30.355
weird out there on the road.

01:30.357 --> 01:32.591
- No, no, no weirdness.
- Okay.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.560
We're, you know, got it on lock.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.595
I'm... I'm dialed in.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.331
So relax, Barbie.
You're off the hook.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.567
But only because
I'm in a kick-ass mood today.

01:41.569 --> 01:44.303
I'm gonna see my baby sister.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.572
I just think
we make a good team,

01:46.574 --> 01:48.474
and I don't wanna mess that up.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.175
You really think
we make a good team?

01:50.177 --> 01:52.344
Yeah, I think
we complement each other.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.580
Sort of the way a left-brain,
right-brain work together.

01:54.582 --> 01:57.583
You know,
you're tough and street-smart,

01:57.585 --> 02:01.587
and sort of, uh...

02:01.589 --> 02:03.589
A murderer.

02:05.659 --> 02:09.895
<i>Good morning, Blood drivers.</i>

02:09.896 --> 02:12.231
<i>Forgive my absence.</i>

02:12.233 --> 02:14.299
<i>Last night's excitement left me</i>

02:14.301 --> 02:17.402
<i>in a sticky situation.</i>

02:19.206 --> 02:20.606
<i>Pretty sure that
some of you out there</i>

02:20.608 --> 02:22.574
<i>might just be able to relate,</i>

02:22.576 --> 02:24.376
<i>but this morning we begin</i>

02:24.378 --> 02:27.446
<i>with the most frightening words</i>

02:27.448 --> 02:30.215
<i>in all of Blood drive:</i>

02:30.217 --> 02:32.317
<i>There's been a change of plan.</i>

02:32.319 --> 02:34.686
<i>For the first time</i>

02:34.688 --> 02:37.523
<i>in Blood drive history,</i>

02:37.525 --> 02:39.591
<i>we're racing directly</i>

02:39.593 --> 02:42.461
<i>through the savage land.</i>

02:42.463 --> 02:45.464
Drivers, start your engines.

02:52.439 --> 02:55.240
What do... what are you...

02:55.242 --> 02:57.910
you make it too easy.

02:57.912 --> 02:59.411
Lighten up, Barbie.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.913
We've just got grenades
in our heads,

03:00.915 --> 03:02.948
driving blood-drinking cars
through the wasteland

03:02.950 --> 03:05.217
in order to find Karma.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.186
Piece of cake.

03:31.412 --> 03:35.547
<i>To keep that right foot down
and your eyes on the prize,</i>

03:35.549 --> 03:38.450
<i>we rigged your car
to shut down for ten minutes</i>

03:38.452 --> 03:43.255
<i>if you touch the brakes even
for a moment.</i>

03:43.257 --> 03:45.324
<i>That's right,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

03:45.326 --> 03:48.427
<i>Blood drive has gone brakeless.</i>

03:48.429 --> 03:50.562
<i>See you at the finish line.</i>

04:03.811 --> 04:05.510
A little fast.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.579
Little fast.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.314
Watch it.
Watch it.

04:09.316 --> 04:10.796
If we don't build a gap,
we're dead.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.433
<i>Pedal boys.</i>

04:39.013 --> 04:41.480
Making great time, hon.

04:44.852 --> 04:47.653
You know what's wonderful
about this moment?

04:47.655 --> 04:49.721
- Potentially winning?
- No, no.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.857
That we're doing it together.

04:51.859 --> 04:54.459
Oh, that too.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.295
It's like we turned back
the clock.

04:56.297 --> 04:57.763
Yep.

04:57.765 --> 05:02.067
Before you started killing
on your own.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.503
In the bathroom
with the handle of a hairbrush.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.406
Water running like I can't hear

05:07.408 --> 05:10.642
what's going on in there.
Oh, god.

05:10.644 --> 05:14.513
We're gonna be
a real homicidal couple again.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.448
This is just super.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.518
When I started doing it
without you?

05:19.520 --> 05:20.652
Right.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.054
Are you kidding me?

05:22.056 --> 05:23.722
Are you kidding me?

05:23.724 --> 05:25.657
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

05:25.659 --> 05:27.392
<i>Are you ever at fault?</i>

05:27.394 --> 05:29.074
- There we go.
<i>- Why do you drive me away?</i>

05:30.531 --> 05:31.897
<i>Ro's coming for ya!</i>

05:31.899 --> 05:33.565
<i>Also means you're dead!</i>

05:39.740 --> 05:41.640
There you are, partner.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.409
<i>Not trying
to be a fuddy-duddy...</i>

05:44.411 --> 05:47.779
Just hold on.
I'm coming your way.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.681
'Cause I'm the man
with the plan.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.086
You're awake
much earlier than usual.

05:54.088 --> 05:56.088
Who are you talking to?

05:56.090 --> 05:58.890
Nobody, baby.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.625
I got some work stuff
to take care of

06:00.627 --> 06:01.927
before my shift starts.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.929
It's like we never get a break,
you know?

06:03.931 --> 06:05.630
I do not.

06:05.632 --> 06:08.567
Security guards appear
to do very little.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.736
Wow.
Okay.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.404
Agree to dis'.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.985
Your behavior is strange.

06:28.654 --> 06:31.690
You have more swagger.

06:32.959 --> 06:36.661
Your body language is that
of an Alpha primate.

06:36.663 --> 06:40.932
Last night, a lot of things
changed between us, baby.

06:43.169 --> 06:45.737
You're referring
to our intercourse?

06:45.739 --> 06:48.440
Totally.

06:48.442 --> 06:52.544
Oh, hey, might be home
late tonight.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.746
Might grab a drink after work
so don't wait up.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.582
Unacceptable.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.884
Hey, hey, hey.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.419
Relax.

07:03.524 --> 07:06.558
We took things to a new level.
You know what I'm saying?

07:06.560 --> 07:09.694
Emotional levels.
Feelings.

07:09.696 --> 07:14.466
We're, like, vulnerable
to each other's needs now.

07:14.468 --> 07:17.636
So there'll be times
when you're gonna lean on me

07:17.638 --> 07:20.639
and then other times...

07:23.577 --> 07:26.511
When I'm not gonna come home
and do what the fuck I want.

07:31.517 --> 07:32.784
Yes, dear.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.988
- Really?
- Correct.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.724
I have no reason
not to trust you.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.962
Really?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.897
Okay.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.568
So I'll be back later.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.736
I look forward to it.

07:53.005 --> 07:56.041
Have a lovely day.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.550
I think we got this.

08:05.552 --> 08:08.520
If we keep this pace
we should be fine.

08:26.973 --> 08:29.841
Is that...?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.510
Barbarian horde?

08:31.512 --> 08:34.279
Yep, that's a barbarian horde.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.879
Did they... holy shit!

09:07.881 --> 09:10.882
Okay.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.897
Stay calm!
Stay calm!

09:25.899 --> 09:27.899
Don't brake!
Don't brake!

09:39.645 --> 09:41.046
Find me, you bitch.

09:43.150 --> 09:46.051
Aah.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.770
That was way too close.

10:05.772 --> 10:09.808
On the bright side,
we're in first place now.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.844
What's wrong with looking
on the bright side?

10:12.846 --> 10:14.613
Whoa!
Shit!

10:14.615 --> 10:15.947
I can't see.
I can't see!

10:15.949 --> 10:17.782
- We got this.
- How exactly do we got this?

10:17.784 --> 10:19.384
I'm a great backseat driver.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.820
Just ask Christopher.
Uh...

10:23.657 --> 10:26.725
Right, right, right, right.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.059
I don't know how long
I can keep this up.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.862
Okay, just keep it straight.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.769
What're they doing?
Where are they going?

10:37.771 --> 10:40.105
Oh, shit, slow down.
You gotta slow down.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.673
More.
Stop the car.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.108
- We can't.
- You gotta brake.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.809
- We can't!
- The road's blocked ahead!

10:44.811 --> 10:46.211
Stop... you gotta hit the brake!
We can't!

10:46.213 --> 10:47.213
Arthur, no!

10:52.219 --> 10:54.719
- You're welcome.
<i>- Engine disabled.</i>

10:54.721 --> 10:56.755
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

11:01.694 --> 11:04.829
We just got wile E. Coyote'd.

11:09.769 --> 11:13.138
End of the line.
Let's go, Barbie.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.140
Beep, beep.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.151
I got this.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.920
How are you?
Name is Arthur Bailey.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.321
Great to me...
aah!

12:32.119 --> 12:33.852
Oh.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.508
What the hell?

13:25.472 --> 13:27.372
You!

13:27.374 --> 13:29.507
You were on stage
the night Arthur disappeared.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.376
I'm sorry but if you'd like
a signed photo

13:31.378 --> 13:33.044
you'll have to send a
self-addressed stamped envelope

13:33.046 --> 13:36.047
to 5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5...

13:36.049 --> 13:38.149
- Where is he?
- Safe...

13:38.151 --> 13:41.519
In my capable hands.

13:43.356 --> 13:44.823
Where's Arthur?

13:44.825 --> 13:46.391
Is that who you're
really looking for

13:46.393 --> 13:48.193
down here, Christopher?
Hmm?

13:48.195 --> 13:50.395
I thought you'd joined
heart enterprises

13:50.397 --> 13:52.096
for the robot pussy.

13:52.098 --> 13:53.965
How'd you know about that?

13:53.967 --> 13:56.367
How's that investigation
going, constable?

13:56.369 --> 13:58.536
Hmm?

13:58.538 --> 14:00.371
Shut up.
What Aki and I share

14:00.373 --> 14:01.606
is none of your business.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.608
Aha.

14:03.610 --> 14:07.178
I suspect trust
isn't what you're sharing.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.848
You know, she's watching us
right now

14:09.850 --> 14:14.085
through that new eye of yours.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.453
<i>Hello?</i>

14:15.455 --> 14:18.890
<i>Hello.
Aki, darling.</i>

14:20.527 --> 14:22.493
Stop it!

14:31.872 --> 14:34.873
Say hello to the misses.

14:51.156 --> 14:52.590
So, beautiful.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.492
My name is Carolina.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.629
Do you know where we are?

14:57.631 --> 15:02.033
This is Majora.
Our home.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.902
They call us barbarians,

15:03.904 --> 15:07.205
but it's not exactly barbaric,
is it?

15:07.207 --> 15:09.974
The seedmakers
abandoned this resort

15:09.976 --> 15:12.977
because it didn't produce
enough cash for them.

15:12.979 --> 15:13.979
The penny...

15:14.981 --> 15:15.981
And the penis...

15:17.017 --> 15:20.018
Are all they care about.

15:24.658 --> 15:26.925
Follow me.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.603
All right!

16:02.494 --> 16:05.129
Take it off.

16:05.131 --> 16:08.032
The world went to hell
so you opened a Burke Williams?

16:08.034 --> 16:10.101
Males roll in the dirt
like pigs,

16:10.103 --> 16:11.703
doesn't mean we have to.

16:11.705 --> 16:14.105
Look, I don't have time
for this.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.506
I need to go get my sister.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.608
You'll find many sisters here,
Grace.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.178
My real sister.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.579
Take a seat.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.149
Sit down.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.251
Relax.

16:27.253 --> 16:30.555
When I get back, you and I
will have a nice, long chat,

16:30.557 --> 16:33.725
and you can tell me all
about why you can't stay

16:33.727 --> 16:36.661
here in paradise.

16:46.138 --> 16:48.740
Move it along.
Let's go.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.030
The hell?

17:34.054 --> 17:36.621
Fuck a chainsaw.

17:36.623 --> 17:39.757
Oh, god.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.805
What the fuck?

17:58.744 --> 18:02.747
Oh, thank god.
Never again.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.715
I'll never come in here again.
I promise.

18:22.501 --> 18:24.769
What do you want from me, Domi?

18:24.771 --> 18:27.205
The only language I speak
is English.

18:27.207 --> 18:30.741
Not you language, idiot.
Your love language.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.578
Did you read any of the books
that I gave you?

18:33.580 --> 18:35.246
Oh, yeah, that's what we need.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.648
Another book to tell me
how to make "kiss coupons"

18:37.650 --> 18:40.218
or my... my "seven daily
marriage affirmations."

18:40.220 --> 18:42.753
It doesn't work
if you don't try.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.822
No wonder we can't
make any progress.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.691
You're emotionally immature.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.860
You don't even have emotions!

18:48.862 --> 18:51.863
The doctor said so!

18:51.865 --> 18:55.466
It's not my fault
those books are a scam.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.469
All you do
is treat me like a kid,

18:58.471 --> 19:00.238
telling me what to do
all the time.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.540
I wouldn't have to
if you read a book

19:02.542 --> 19:06.177
that told you how to be a man.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.752
I'd like to get out now.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.788
Can't stop.
No brakes.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.791
Besides, if I left you behind,

19:20.793 --> 19:22.727
your head would blow up.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.729
More importantly, so would mine.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.798
Good, because I'd rather be
a smear on the highway

19:27.800 --> 19:29.534
than have to ride another mile

19:29.536 --> 19:30.768
with a...

19:30.770 --> 19:32.803
A what, cliff?
Say it.

19:32.805 --> 19:36.340
Say it.
Or are you too stupid?

19:36.342 --> 19:38.676
Well, I was stupid enough
to marry you!

19:41.847 --> 19:44.549
Apologize.

19:44.551 --> 19:45.783
No.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.618
<i>Engine disabled.
Ten minutes.</i>

19:47.620 --> 19:50.888
Well, then we're gonna
sit here until we both die,

19:50.890 --> 19:54.659
because there is no way that
I am crossing the finish line

19:54.661 --> 19:57.261
with a pathetic little loser
like you.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.665
Oh.
Hello.

20:02.669 --> 20:05.269
I suppose this is my fault too.

20:08.942 --> 20:11.609
Hey.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.211
Water.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.946
Please.
Water.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.963
Thank the goddamn tits.

20:31.965 --> 20:35.299
Finally, another dude.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.401
Shh.

20:37.403 --> 20:41.272
Don't tell 'em I got this.

20:41.274 --> 20:44.842
Don't get your hopes up.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.778
It only opens this door.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.738
Keep the juices flowing, man.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.406
You're gonna need it.

21:15.408 --> 21:18.042
How long have you been here?

21:18.044 --> 21:20.611
Uh...

21:20.613 --> 21:22.346
No idea.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.283
What do they want from you?

21:25.285 --> 21:26.951
The only thing they can't get
on their own.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.353
The clam ram.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.025
- You mean they...
- Look for yourself.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.835
Ah.
Oh...

21:47.040 --> 21:48.839
Quiet!

21:48.841 --> 21:50.908
Ah, oh, god!

21:56.381 --> 21:57.848
Oh, shit.
Oh, god.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.853
How are you still alive?

22:02.855 --> 22:05.089
Eh, it's not so bad.

22:05.091 --> 22:08.993
After a while,
it just kind of tingles.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.995
Glad there's another bro here,
though.

22:10.997 --> 22:11.997
Move it.

22:16.002 --> 22:19.070
Hey, dude...

22:19.072 --> 22:21.372
Welcome to paradise!

22:22.709 --> 22:25.810
Can I get a beer?

22:25.812 --> 22:27.445
Ah.

22:27.447 --> 22:30.915
Ah, I am loving
this little pit stop.

22:30.917 --> 22:33.017
Yeah, we'll see how much you
love it when we lose the race

22:33.019 --> 22:34.485
and our heads explode.

22:34.487 --> 22:35.986
Half the field is
back on the highway

22:35.988 --> 22:37.688
waiting for their cars
to turn on.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.423
There's more than enough time
to enjoy

22:39.425 --> 22:41.892
a bit of Majora's hospitality.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.894
And this is so refreshing.
Don't you think?

22:43.896 --> 22:45.830
Like citrus breeze.

22:50.436 --> 22:52.436
Stop right there.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.472
Torrent downloaded from rarbg

22:54.474 --> 22:57.775
back down.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.477
I understand your resistance,

22:59.479 --> 23:02.780
but I want you to tear down
your wall and be free.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.949
Everybody's free here at Majora.

23:04.951 --> 23:07.852
Yeah, what about him?

23:07.854 --> 23:10.855
- Every person here is free.
- Yeah, got it.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.857
Um, all right, well,
thanks for the wash and wax,

23:12.859 --> 23:14.892
but I have places to be,
so where's Arthur?

23:14.894 --> 23:16.727
Is Arthur your male?

23:16.729 --> 23:18.829
No, he is not my male.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.931
He is my partner,

23:20.933 --> 23:22.933
and we have a rehab facility
to get to,

23:22.935 --> 23:24.168
so if you ladies don't mind...

23:24.170 --> 23:28.472
Claireview rehabilitation
center for women?

23:28.474 --> 23:29.940
You know it?

23:29.942 --> 23:31.575
We were inmates there.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.744
Tortured by their guards,

23:33.746 --> 23:34.945
their men,

23:34.947 --> 23:37.181
but we burned that hell hole
to the ground.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.817
So if you're still trying
to find Claireview,

23:39.819 --> 23:43.421
why don't you head up north
and look for the crater?

23:43.423 --> 23:45.456
It might still be smoking.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.525
Another dead end.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.927
Goddamn it, Karma,

23:49.929 --> 23:52.897
you never make this easy,
do you?

23:52.899 --> 23:56.600
Karma d'Argento's your sister?

23:56.602 --> 23:58.969
How do you know that name?

23:58.971 --> 24:01.772
She's been with us
since the beginning.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.877
Take me to her.

24:09.981 --> 24:13.117
Hey, yeah, uh, sorry.
Could I, uh...

24:13.119 --> 24:15.653
Uh, could I, uh, you know,
get a beer?

24:15.655 --> 24:18.122
Ah, sorry, man.
All out.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.592
You got a whole coo...
You got a whole cooler.

24:21.594 --> 24:22.993
- We gotta get outta here.
- Nice.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.929
Don't be such a whiny bitch,
dude.

24:24.931 --> 24:26.831
The ladies feed us,
give us beer,

24:26.833 --> 24:30.668
and all we gotta do
is jizz for it.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.136
Basically,
we're living the dream.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.005
They suck semen out of your body

24:35.007 --> 24:36.740
with a milking machine.

24:36.742 --> 24:39.043
Yeah?

24:39.045 --> 24:41.011
But at least the machine's
not allowed to vote.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.146
Am I right?

24:42.148 --> 24:44.181
Up top... Like...

24:44.183 --> 24:46.617
Grace's male.

24:46.619 --> 24:48.886
Let's go.

24:50.056 --> 24:51.188
Batter up, man.

24:51.190 --> 24:54.992
Let it all hang out.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.228
- Hey, thanks for the beer, man.
- Yeah, no problem.

24:57.230 --> 24:59.663
No, I'm a hugger.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.738
Whew.

25:22.054 --> 25:24.088
We're afraid our audience
won't be able to connect

25:24.090 --> 25:25.923
to any of these characters.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.092
They barely even wanna fuck 'em.

25:28.094 --> 25:30.661
Because they're not cool.

25:30.663 --> 25:32.196
Maybe we should have 'em
in sunglasses.

25:32.198 --> 25:35.266
And smoke.
Smoking and sunglasses.

25:35.268 --> 25:38.769
But there needs to be a story.

25:38.771 --> 25:41.071
Subtle,
nuanced characterizations

25:41.073 --> 25:42.206
of love, betrayal, and...

25:42.208 --> 25:44.108
no one cares about story.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.876
We told you that.

25:45.878 --> 25:49.013
Yes, tell me again
about how my show works.

25:49.015 --> 25:52.016
We intend to.
I reviewed your SDCs.

25:52.018 --> 25:53.884
They are well below
target range.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.954
My strategic dismemberment
counts are 38% above target.

25:56.956 --> 25:59.056
And your survival rates
are too high.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.891
Your per capita maim number's
the lowest we've seen

26:00.893 --> 26:02.860
in a decade.
And worst of all,

26:02.862 --> 26:05.162
in your most recent race report,

26:05.164 --> 26:07.698
I count 15 typos.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.066
15.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.235
- Impossible.
- You're aware of our policy

26:11.237 --> 26:13.938
mandating the use
of the Oxford comma?

26:17.977 --> 26:19.944
What the fuck, man?
Nothing more than

26:19.946 --> 26:22.980
a stylistic conceit
of publishing houses.

26:22.982 --> 26:24.882
Entirely gratuitous
to precise language.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.854
That's enough, slink.

26:32.124 --> 26:34.959
I'm sorry.
All this bend-your-wrist

26:34.961 --> 26:38.262
song and dance horseshit
just doesn't do it for me.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.998
Here's the top line note.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.902
Between the Meadeville fiasco
and the escapades at Kane Hill,

26:44.904 --> 26:47.271
you've lost control.

26:47.273 --> 26:50.874
Our in-house viewership has
spiked to an all-time high

26:50.876 --> 26:53.143
since you've been absent.

26:53.145 --> 26:54.945
We're going public.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.280
"Blood drive" will air

26:56.282 --> 26:59.283
worldwide starting
next Wednesday.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.288
Finally.

27:04.290 --> 27:07.358
Without you.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.026
What?

27:09.028 --> 27:12.096
But how?

27:12.098 --> 27:15.265
How?
You... you... you can't just... just

27:15.267 --> 27:17.868
plop the "Blood drive"
into people's homes

27:17.870 --> 27:19.403
without my guiding hand.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.905
A work like this,

27:21.907 --> 27:25.175
it needs a singular voice,
an artist,

27:25.177 --> 27:28.812
and I will not compromise
my vision for anyone.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.181
We don't need you.

27:33.052 --> 27:34.418
Fine.
We'll do it your way then,

27:34.420 --> 27:36.086
but I'd like a larger trailer.

27:36.088 --> 27:39.790
Just tell me what you want.

27:39.792 --> 27:42.793
I want you to die.

27:47.132 --> 27:50.267
What do you mean,
we can't kill him?

27:50.269 --> 27:53.170
What the fuck is a holding deal?

27:53.172 --> 27:55.039
Jesus.

27:57.043 --> 28:01.011
I guess we've still got
some bullshit to work out.

28:10.088 --> 28:13.090
We owe our lives to your sister.

28:13.092 --> 28:16.960
All of Majora exists
because of her bravery.

28:16.962 --> 28:19.863
She led the revolt
at Claireview.

28:19.865 --> 28:22.232
I always knew that I was strong,

28:22.234 --> 28:25.969
but when I saw
your sister fight, damn.

28:25.971 --> 28:27.838
She made us brave.

28:27.840 --> 28:31.341
She made us all brave.

28:31.343 --> 28:35.245
This is a holy place.

28:35.247 --> 28:38.015
Wait, where's Karma?

28:38.017 --> 28:40.150
I'm sorry.

28:40.152 --> 28:42.486
Karma fell in the revolt.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.888
There was nothing I could do.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.325
Wait.
What do you mean?

28:53.966 --> 28:56.967
Karma's dead.

29:32.403 --> 29:34.271
How did she die?

29:34.273 --> 29:36.406
There was so much chaos.

29:36.408 --> 29:40.144
All I know is
she fought like a warrior.

29:40.146 --> 29:42.246
She died alone?

29:42.248 --> 29:45.282
She died surrounded
by her sisters.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.851
No!

29:47.853 --> 29:50.854
I'm her sister.

29:53.859 --> 29:56.960
I should have been here.
I should have... I should have...

30:01.866 --> 30:04.468
I need to be with her alone.

30:06.204 --> 30:08.472
Sisters, leave us quickly.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.474
Quickly!

30:16.482 --> 30:20.851
Can I ask you...

30:20.853 --> 30:24.888
Why'd you two part ways
if you were so close?

30:26.991 --> 30:29.493
It's complicated.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.361
There was this guy that...

30:31.363 --> 30:33.564
you see?
Men.

30:33.566 --> 30:36.934
Men took Karma away from you,
and men took Karma away from me.

30:36.936 --> 30:39.503
Oh, for fuck sakes, just go!

31:00.492 --> 31:02.559
- Aah!
- Causing trouble already?

31:02.561 --> 31:04.595
What you're doing
to those men is immoral.

31:04.597 --> 31:07.965
The seedmakers have food,
shelter, a reason to ejaculate.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.933
That's all the beasts need.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.537
Put him on the altar,

31:13.539 --> 31:16.940
and when he's dead,
kill the short, silly one too.

31:18.344 --> 31:21.345
Up, up!

31:31.489 --> 31:33.490
Domi.

31:33.492 --> 31:37.961
Your wife's not gonna save you.

31:37.963 --> 31:39.596
She can't fight as well as us.

31:39.598 --> 31:43.100
- Shut up.
- It's not her fault.

31:44.435 --> 31:47.437
It's genetics.

31:53.679 --> 31:55.646
Come on, baby.

31:55.648 --> 31:57.948
Get me out of here.

32:38.056 --> 32:40.657
Ladies, I want to thank you

32:40.659 --> 32:43.427
for the delightful spa treatment
and refreshments...

32:47.299 --> 32:49.499
But it's time I see myself out.

32:51.102 --> 32:53.070
Hello, honey.

32:53.072 --> 32:56.573
How was your day?

32:56.575 --> 32:59.710
Oh, you know.

32:59.712 --> 33:01.111
How was yours?

33:01.113 --> 33:03.981
Acceptable.

33:09.455 --> 33:12.756
I know this is new
to both of us.

33:12.758 --> 33:16.360
Relationships are work and shit.

33:16.362 --> 33:18.462
But when you installed
my prosthetic eye,

33:18.464 --> 33:21.098
did you install
some sort of software

33:21.100 --> 33:23.400
so you could see
what I'm seeing?

33:23.402 --> 33:27.070
And some sort of...

33:27.072 --> 33:29.506
Puke-Cannon?

33:35.447 --> 33:38.448
How else could I trust you?

33:38.450 --> 33:40.183
Baby, why?

33:40.185 --> 33:43.587
One of my many objectives is
to maintain a level of control

33:43.589 --> 33:46.757
over heart assets.

33:49.761 --> 33:53.363
Is that all I am to you?
Just... just another asset?

33:53.365 --> 33:54.498
'Cause I thought
we had something...

33:54.500 --> 33:57.034
oh, baby.

33:57.036 --> 34:00.771
I'm an autonomous
kinetic intercourse machine.

34:00.773 --> 34:03.507
I have no emotional directives,

34:03.509 --> 34:05.142
and even if I did,

34:05.144 --> 34:09.146
they would not be affected
by filling my semen reservoirs.

34:11.583 --> 34:14.818
But... I thought
I could trust you.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.585
Trust?

34:16.588 --> 34:18.688
Like I could trust you
not to snoop around

34:18.690 --> 34:20.690
where you don't belong?

34:23.462 --> 34:26.530
If you were attempting
to manipulate my emotions,

34:26.532 --> 34:28.697
Christopher...

34:28.699 --> 34:32.569
I'm afraid you've
only manipulated yourself.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.639
I have no emotions.

34:36.641 --> 34:39.208
I feel nothing.

34:43.581 --> 34:46.583
So we'll just keep it casual,
I guess.

34:49.688 --> 34:52.456
After all...

34:52.458 --> 34:54.458
You're literally

34:54.460 --> 34:57.861
just a sex object.

35:06.204 --> 35:08.738
I was too late.

35:11.844 --> 35:13.710
All those miles I raced,

35:13.712 --> 35:17.180
all those people I killed.

35:19.451 --> 35:22.819
None of it mattered.

35:22.821 --> 35:25.755
Is this what it felt like?

35:28.760 --> 35:31.761
Is this what it felt like
when I left you?

35:33.765 --> 35:36.566
'Cause it hurts so bad.

35:41.740 --> 35:45.208
Grace!
Aah!

35:56.722 --> 35:58.588
I thought she'd come for me.

35:58.590 --> 36:02.159
Ah, forget about her, man.

36:03.594 --> 36:05.262
You wanna...

36:05.264 --> 36:07.797
I don't know...

36:07.799 --> 36:11.301
Sneak into
the seeding room and...

36:11.303 --> 36:13.803
Milk ourselves?

36:15.640 --> 36:17.707
You know, teach 'em a lesson?

36:27.252 --> 36:28.685
Hey there, handsome.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.860
Grace!

36:36.862 --> 36:38.361
Aah!

36:38.363 --> 36:40.630
No Grace, no mercy.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.766
Aah!
Aah!

36:44.803 --> 36:46.570
Why are hot girls
always so mean?

36:46.572 --> 36:48.338
You keep on talking

36:48.340 --> 36:49.639
and you'll die.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.408
I can't help that I'm charming.

36:51.410 --> 36:54.377
All seedmakers,
you're all the same.

36:54.379 --> 36:57.614
You killed Karma
and you destroyed Grace's life!

36:57.616 --> 36:59.449
No, no, no,
you got it all wrong.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.751
I'm trying to help her!

37:01.753 --> 37:04.788
Leave him alone!

37:04.790 --> 37:08.692
Ugh.

37:08.694 --> 37:10.894
I didn't want you to see this,
Grace,

37:10.896 --> 37:13.663
but I'm glad you're here now.

37:13.665 --> 37:17.300
This is the only way
you'll be free.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.417
You did this.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.553
Sisters, defend Majora!

37:36.555 --> 37:39.422
Grace.
Grace.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.291
Cut the ropes.
We'll take her together.

37:41.293 --> 37:43.793
I got this, Barbie.

37:45.564 --> 37:47.464
It's girl's night.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.699
You're poison, Grace.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.702
Brainwashed by the capitalists

37:52.704 --> 37:54.571
and the warmongers

37:54.573 --> 37:57.340
and the seedmakers.
Shut up, Carolina.

37:57.342 --> 37:59.409
Your bullshit's already killed
one d'Argento.

37:59.411 --> 38:01.745
It wasn't my fault.
I loved her.

38:01.747 --> 38:05.649
Grace, what're you doing?

38:05.651 --> 38:07.684
Let's see
if you can kill another.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.653
I'm done fighting.

38:09.655 --> 38:10.787
Aah!
Grace!

38:15.594 --> 38:17.861
You're a fucking disGrace
to your kind.

38:17.863 --> 38:20.463
Yeah?
What kind is that?

38:20.465 --> 38:21.665
Huh?

38:21.667 --> 38:23.833
An angry, bitter piece of shit

38:23.835 --> 38:26.469
that blames the world
for her mistakes?

38:26.471 --> 38:28.371
That's not what I taught
my sister,

38:28.373 --> 38:30.674
and I know that's not what
she would want for this place.

38:31.677 --> 38:33.977
You failed her.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.546
Just like I failed her.

38:36.548 --> 38:39.616
'Cause here's the truth.

38:39.618 --> 38:42.752
No matter what shit
you've been through,

38:42.754 --> 38:46.756
it doesn't justify
hurting other people.

38:46.758 --> 38:49.459
He taught me that.

38:49.461 --> 38:50.860
Then it's a lie.

38:50.862 --> 38:54.497
No, the truth's the truth,

38:54.499 --> 38:57.600
no matter what idiot says it.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.938
So come on, Carolina.

39:01.940 --> 39:05.475
I'm dying to see what
a washed-up failure like you

39:05.477 --> 39:06.776
can do to me.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.645
Grace!

39:21.893 --> 39:23.893
Why you laughing, huh?

39:23.895 --> 39:25.662
Huh?
Is that all you got?

39:29.468 --> 39:32.035
What, you can't finish the job?

39:34.673 --> 39:36.439
I know what you're trying to do.

39:36.441 --> 39:37.874
You want to be punished
for your guilt,

39:37.876 --> 39:39.743
and I won't be part of it.

39:39.745 --> 39:42.746
Come on, Carolina.

39:42.748 --> 39:46.015
Look how quickly
we've torn ourselves apart.

39:49.521 --> 39:51.955
Grace.
What'd you do to her?

39:51.957 --> 39:54.791
Nothing we haven't done
to ourselves.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.887
I'm so sorry we had
that little kerfuffle.

40:23.889 --> 40:27.791
I'm sorry too.
It was completely my fault.

40:27.793 --> 40:29.726
You know, you're right.

40:29.728 --> 40:32.095
Solving problems together,

40:32.097 --> 40:34.497
that's when we're at our best.

40:34.499 --> 40:37.700
I'm so glad you said that
because...

40:37.702 --> 40:41.104
I have a little project
that the two of us can share.

40:46.111 --> 40:49.779
Sweetheart,
that is the most romantic thing

40:49.781 --> 40:52.682
anyone has ever done for me.

41:17.776 --> 41:21.711
I'm sorry about Karma.

41:21.713 --> 41:25.114
I know there's nothing I can do
to bring her back to you.

41:27.886 --> 41:32.555
But all that pain
was put on you by heart.

41:32.557 --> 41:36.559
Your sister is
one of thousands of victims.

41:38.797 --> 41:41.631
The truth is...

41:43.134 --> 41:47.136
I don't know how I can do this
without you anymore.

41:50.909 --> 41:54.644
So no more bullshit.

41:54.646 --> 41:57.113
Nothing tying us down.

41:57.115 --> 41:58.982
You and me working together

41:58.984 --> 42:01.818
actually stand a chance
to fight heart

42:01.820 --> 42:04.821
for Karma
and all the rest of 'em.

42:07.759 --> 42:10.927
Grace, we're so close.

42:12.162 --> 42:14.163
I need you.

42:18.069 --> 42:21.104
Grace, talk to me.

42:22.973 --> 42:26.709
Can you hear me?

42:26.711 --> 42:29.612
Grace?

42:29.614 --> 42:31.614
Grace?

42:32.305 --> 42:38.613
