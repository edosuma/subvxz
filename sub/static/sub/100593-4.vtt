WEBVTT

01:33.051 --> 01:35.095
Black, two Splenda.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.722
You rock!

01:38.098 --> 01:39.224
You check the ward?

01:39.308 --> 01:41.310
Like walking through a vegetable patch.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.194
Hey.

02:37.866 --> 02:42.246
Sweetheart? Sweetheart?
You've been in a coma for a long time.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.122
But everything's gonna be fine.

02:44.206 --> 02:47.167
Listen to my voice.
You were in a terrible accident.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.253
-Let's go.
-It's okay, Sara.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.171
Six years is a long time.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.299
We're transferring you over
to our neuroscience wing.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.937
What was that?

03:10.649 --> 03:11.900
Thank you.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.819
Thank you.

03:22.786 --> 03:25.080
I felt like I knew you guys.

03:26.582 --> 03:28.417
-Ew.
-You don't just walk in.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.710
Last time I talked to him--

03:29.793 --> 03:30.794
Hey, guys.

03:30.878 --> 03:34.006
Sorry, but the power outage messed up
the machine. We can only take cash.

03:34.089 --> 03:35.465
What's cash?

03:37.134 --> 03:39.136
There's an ATM at the liquor store
around the corner on Peachtree.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.762
No, it's cool. Seriously.

03:40.846 --> 03:45.142
We'll just hop on over to the bank and...
No, really, it's no problem.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.102
No, no. One of you has to stay.

03:47.186 --> 03:49.313
-Run!
-Oh, no!

03:50.564 --> 03:51.565
Great.

03:52.441 --> 03:53.442
...after us.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.068
-I'm trying. I have heels.
-Come on. Hurry.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.653
Forget something?

03:59.031 --> 04:01.325
-You kidding me? Give me--
-Nuh-uh.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.368
Pay up or get a new crusty bag.

04:03.452 --> 04:05.287
Or how about I tell
your manager you stole it?

04:06.413 --> 04:07.831
Chill. Chill.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.792
What's going on, Archie and Veronica?

04:10.876 --> 04:13.462
-Hey, stay out of this, man.
-Nah, why don't you pay the girl?

04:13.545 --> 04:14.963
Cody, I don't need you saving me.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.923
Oh, no, I'm not saving you.
I'm saving them.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.426
Yeah, that's right. I'm doing you a favor.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.303
'Cause Alia here,
she will kick all your asses

04:21.386 --> 04:23.347
before you can call your mama and daddy
for help.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.058
So what do you say
you just give her some cash, huh?

04:42.658 --> 04:44.785
For the register and for you.

04:46.662 --> 04:48.288
Now, will you go to prom with me?

04:49.873 --> 04:52.793
I really could've handled things.
I didn't need your help.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.338
I mean, I guess.
You know, force of habit, whatever.

04:56.421 --> 04:59.174
But it was awesome. We probably
could've gotten more out of 'em.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.635
I'm just glad they didn't get me fired.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.596
So what if they did? You're not gonna
need this much longer anyway.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.392
-Really?
-Yes. Really. Check it.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.727
Now look.

05:11.103 --> 05:14.398
Gus' friend Stevie is selling this bad boy
for only 1,700 bucks.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.650
The only way to get to LA is to look LA.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.819
Yeah, that and $3,200,

05:18.902 --> 05:21.697
which we currently have 2,673.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.615
So, best-case scenario,

05:23.699 --> 05:26.076
I say we leave in...
I don't know, ten weeks?

05:26.159 --> 05:27.619
Someone else is gonna nab it by then.

05:27.703 --> 05:29.413
Well, then we'll wait for the next one.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.915
-Oh, my God.
-We need an actual plan.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.209
Why you always wanna wait?

05:35.919 --> 05:37.713
I just want the timing to be right.

05:39.256 --> 05:41.216
It's never gonna be right.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.594
But it'll be a start.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.521
Hello?

06:01.945 --> 06:03.906
That's really good.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.825
-Give me a squeeze.
-Mom.

06:12.581 --> 06:13.665
Mama.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.459
It's me.

06:17.419 --> 06:18.420
Alia?

06:19.213 --> 06:20.214
Alia?

06:23.050 --> 06:24.760
-What's wrong with her?
-She doesn't--

06:24.843 --> 06:27.513
-She doesn't even recognize me.
-Hey, come here. Let me talk to you.

06:27.596 --> 06:30.182
This confusion, this memory loss,
it's normal.

06:30.766 --> 06:33.185
But she's speaking.
Let's take that as a good sign.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.938
It's actually kind of miraculous.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.481
Miraculous.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.760
When your mother was brought in
six years ago,

07:06.844 --> 07:09.221
you can see here
that the damage was irreversible.

07:09.721 --> 07:13.767
And over here, you can see...
some of that damage has been repaired.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.061
You mean she's gonna be okay?

07:16.144 --> 07:19.523
I mean, I've never
seen anything like this, but...

07:19.606 --> 07:22.651
Be straight with me. What kind of recovery
are we looking at? How long?

07:22.734 --> 07:24.862
Alia, listen. The brain,

07:24.945 --> 07:28.782
sometimes
it has the ability to rewire itself.

07:28.866 --> 07:31.201
<c.styledotitalic>-Make the call now.
-But it could be months before you even--

07:31.285 --> 07:32.911
I need to make a call.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.126
Okay, Sara. Who?

07:39.209 --> 07:40.961
I need to make a call.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.713
Who do you need to call?

07:42.796 --> 07:43.797
Got a number?

07:44.840 --> 07:50.762
404-555-0169.

07:55.559 --> 07:56.643
Hello?

08:01.690 --> 08:03.400
Who are you trying to call?

08:04.776 --> 08:06.403
-Mom?
-Alia...

08:07.946 --> 08:11.783
Memory is a complicated thing.
Just take it one day at a time.

08:12.576 --> 08:16.747
And today is a good day.
Let's start there. Your mother's back.

09:11.009 --> 09:15.722
<c.styledotitalic>Ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmakwanzakah!

09:15.806 --> 09:19.059
<c.styledotitalic>Oh, my God. The new EV3 kit?
Thank you, Mama!

09:19.142 --> 09:24.064
<c.styledotitalic>You betcha, Bubba-diddle.
<c.styledotitalic>Who knew my baby was such a nerd?

09:34.658 --> 09:36.827
Hey. You got the videos I sent.

09:37.286 --> 09:39.997
-Hi. Yes.
<c.styledotitalic>-Wow. Wow.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.916
They help. Thanks.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.672
So, it's time for your assessment.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.091
Let's get you ready. Okay, hon?

09:52.217 --> 09:54.511
Now, where did I put your shoes?

09:54.970 --> 09:57.806
You left them under the chair
next to the window.

09:57.890 --> 09:58.891
Do you see them?

10:00.058 --> 10:01.560
You speak Spanish?

10:01.643 --> 10:02.978
You speak Spanish?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.314
I guess.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.617
Excellent, Sara.
I'm gonna take it up a notch, all right?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.501
Green.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.419
Angry.

10:28.587 --> 10:29.630
Twenty-seven.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.758
Man, woman, boy, girl.

10:32.841 --> 10:36.136
That's correct. But what
is their relationship to one another?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.390
Father, mother--

10:40.474 --> 10:45.103
I got a perfect score on the JFK
Coma Recovery Scale and the Glasgow.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.147
That's more than enough
to release me to outpatient care.

10:47.231 --> 10:49.566
Sara,
you've made a truly miraculous recovery.

10:50.067 --> 10:51.652
We are just trying to understand why,

10:51.735 --> 10:56.490
when there is so much that is coming
back to you, there are certain... gaps.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.792
You said that being around family

11:06.875 --> 11:10.921
exercises circuits in the brain
responsible for long-term memories.

11:11.421 --> 11:15.843
Let me go home with... my daughter.

11:16.969 --> 11:20.097
Maybe then... I'll start remembering.

11:25.519 --> 11:29.189
It's not like our old place, but
I kinda rely on tips for rent, you know?

11:30.315 --> 11:31.608
Do you have a father?

11:32.693 --> 11:34.736
Well, that's kinda how babies are made.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.282
I know how babies are made, Alia.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.825
Sorry. Right.

11:41.118 --> 11:43.745
I mean... I never knew him.

11:44.830 --> 11:48.208
It's always just been the two of us.
We liked it that way.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.461
I upset you.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.213
It's nothing.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.382
So, are you sure you're ready to leave?

11:55.465 --> 11:57.426
I mean,
Dr. Koh is only trying to help you.

12:01.138 --> 12:03.056
She's done everything she can.

12:03.140 --> 12:06.602
I just want you to get better.
Seriously, what's the rush?

12:06.685 --> 12:09.021
I just can't be in here anymore.
I'm going for a swim.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.692
She's not my mom.
Like, she's there, but she's not.

12:13.775 --> 12:16.111
I thought I was gonna have to give
my own mother the birds and the bees talk.

12:16.195 --> 12:17.738
And then earlier,
she spoke freakin' Spanish.

12:17.821 --> 12:18.822
She spoke Spanish?

12:18.906 --> 12:20.949
Yeah, which isn't half as weird
as her calling me "Alia."

12:21.033 --> 12:23.410
-I...
-She never called me by my name.

12:23.493 --> 12:24.912
It was always some new pet name.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.705
Like, before the accident,
she was stuck on "Junebug."

12:26.788 --> 12:28.207
Alia, can I say something?

12:29.374 --> 12:30.876
Her memories aren't the answer.

12:31.293 --> 12:32.294
They're not?

12:32.377 --> 12:35.756
Even if they all came back today,
you would still be total strangers.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.132
Think about it.

12:37.216 --> 12:40.469
Aren't you a completely different person
today than you were six years ago?

12:40.969 --> 12:43.096
What you're feeling,
it's not a medical issue.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.807
It's about two humans
getting to know each other again.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.210
Helps, doesn't it? The water.

13:15.254 --> 13:16.839
After what you've been through,

13:16.922 --> 13:19.383
it's manna from heaven
for those stiff joints, isn't it?

13:25.639 --> 13:27.683
I thought that was you in the cafeteria.

13:28.183 --> 13:29.560
Yeah, I got your call.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.396
Then what took you so long?

13:40.195 --> 13:42.573
Of course I checked for Stone.
That was the first thing I did.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.992
Think if they had one on record,
I'd be holding back?

13:48.120 --> 13:49.413
Hey, Mom.

13:49.913 --> 13:52.791
Dr. Koh said your discharge papers
will be ready in the morning.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.251
I'll come get you then.

13:57.462 --> 14:00.340
Alia, this is Wayne. He's...

14:00.799 --> 14:02.092
I'm an old pal of your mom's.

14:02.634 --> 14:04.178
Are you from the dance company?

14:04.261 --> 14:07.097
No. No, from the same hometown.

14:07.181 --> 14:09.683
Chicago? You don't sound like it.

14:09.766 --> 14:12.728
Well, thank you, young lady.
I worked overtime to lose that accent.

14:13.228 --> 14:16.565
It's cool of you to stop by.
How long are you in town for?

14:16.648 --> 14:17.941
Depends on work.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.611
Maybe we can all get together
before you leave?

14:21.153 --> 14:23.947
I'd love to learn more about my mom
when she was my age.

14:24.031 --> 14:27.326
Well, I'll come armed
with many an embarrassing tale then.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.454
See you at 9:00, 'kay?

14:40.964 --> 14:42.674
Sharp little lady you got there.

14:44.009 --> 14:45.928
She gonna be a problem?

14:46.011 --> 14:47.513
Nothing I can't handle.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.741
So, pretty crappy,
but it's only temporary.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.369
At least that's the plan anyway.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.263
Sorry it's... so...

15:30.305 --> 15:31.306
It's okay.

15:37.729 --> 15:40.566
Just-- Don't you have school or something?

15:41.483 --> 15:44.069
No, I already graduated.

15:44.820 --> 15:47.614
Are you hungry?
I made some pimento cheese sandwiches.

15:48.824 --> 15:53.537
Your go-to recipe. Your only recipe,
actually. You weren't much of a cook.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.081
Sit.

16:12.764 --> 16:17.769
-Or maybe I'm the bad cook?
-No, it's just really... strong.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.481
-Do you mean... spicy?
-Yes. Spicy.

16:21.565 --> 16:24.067
Sorry. You kinda used to drown everything
in hot sauce.

16:25.068 --> 16:28.238
-Let me make you something else.
-It's okay. I'm not hungry.

16:30.532 --> 16:31.950
But I could use a nap.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.456
I made up the bedroom for you.

16:38.207 --> 16:41.543
I'll sleep on the couch
until we figure out what's next.

18:32.613 --> 18:36.617
U-235 is enriched
to one to three percent...

18:37.826 --> 18:41.038
and used inside
the nuclear fission process.

18:42.331 --> 18:43.999
Inside the process...

18:46.084 --> 18:51.965
U-235 is enriched to one to three percent
to be used in nuclear fuel bundles

18:52.049 --> 18:54.676
to moderate the fission process.

18:54.760 --> 19:00.599
A slow-moving neutron bombards
the U-235 atom causing the atom to split.

19:00.682 --> 19:03.727
She was a dancer,
not a freakin' nuclear physicist.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.437
I mean, she made a whole point of it.

19:05.521 --> 19:08.148
I was the smart one. She was the fun one.
It was her shtick.

19:08.232 --> 19:10.317
Hear me out.
When she got into the car accident,

19:10.400 --> 19:12.236
do you know where she was going,
what she was doing?

19:12.611 --> 19:13.695
She was getting takeout.

19:13.779 --> 19:14.988
Well, that's what she said.

19:15.489 --> 19:16.865
<c.styledotitalic>Cody, stop.

19:16.949 --> 19:19.535
All I'm saying is,
parents hide stuff from their kids.

19:19.618 --> 19:22.538
<c.styledotitalic>Like my dad. "Business trip" was code for

19:22.621 --> 19:25.040
"I have a whole 'nother family
I like more than you."

19:25.123 --> 19:26.416
And then he bounced for good.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.793
My mom's not like that.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.211
<c.styledotitalic>Look, I'm just trying to protect you.

19:29.294 --> 19:31.547
<c.styledotitalic>Like, last time you saw her,
what, you were 12?

19:31.630 --> 19:33.006
<c.styledotitalic>What did you really know?

19:33.090 --> 19:35.801
Maybe when she got hit by the car,
she was getting takeout.

19:36.969 --> 19:38.595
Or maybe it was something else.

19:38.679 --> 19:43.350
That's crazy. Her brain is just fried.
All I gotta do is get her to remember.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.110
What is this?

19:53.485 --> 19:54.862
A tasting menu.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.155
Sit.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.284
I've been going about things
all the wrong way.

20:01.201 --> 20:04.997
Trying to force you to remember who you
were before is way too much pressure.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.957
I feel like Mrs. Danvers, and I'm sorry.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.041
Mrs. Danvers?

20:08.542 --> 20:09.960
The creepy housekeeper from...

20:10.961 --> 20:15.924
Look, instead of fixating on old memories,
we should work on making new ones.

20:16.508 --> 20:18.510
So we can get to know who we both are now.

20:22.556 --> 20:25.184
Hi. I'm Alia Jordan.

20:27.978 --> 20:32.107
Eighteen years old,
Virgo, INTJ. Ravenclaw.

20:33.108 --> 20:34.526
I like to know how things work.

20:34.610 --> 20:36.945
I like dragonflies
and home makeover shows.

20:37.362 --> 20:38.780
Big, huge fan of Drake.

20:44.411 --> 20:45.787
Sara.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.123
I don't know what I like.

20:48.207 --> 20:51.335
Well, then dig in.
You got your basic food groups.

20:51.418 --> 20:56.798
You got your spaghetti, pizza, PB and J,
pancakes, cookies, hot dogs.

20:57.758 --> 20:58.759
Tater tots.

21:08.018 --> 21:11.146
-This is good.
-Yeah, no. I'm not buying that.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.525
Try this.

21:22.991 --> 21:25.035
Wait. You liked that.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.162
-No.
-Take another bite.

21:37.506 --> 21:39.466
Fine. It's really good.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.928
It's the gateway meat.
No one can argue with bacon.

21:43.011 --> 21:46.598
Plus, it goes really good with pancakes
if you wanna just blend it all together.

21:46.682 --> 21:52.062
Look, this is wonderful, but I have
to get to my coma support group.

21:54.439 --> 21:56.942
You're... in a support group?

21:57.025 --> 21:58.026
Yes.

21:59.194 --> 22:00.487
I thought it could help.

22:00.988 --> 22:04.908
Yeah. That's... That's great.

22:05.576 --> 22:08.537
Okay, well, I should throw this
in the fridge and get ready for work.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.248
Maybe we can have dinner
with your friend Wayne.

22:11.331 --> 22:12.541
I get free food at the diner.

22:12.624 --> 22:15.711
He called.
He had to leave town early. Work stuff.

22:17.171 --> 22:18.839
Damn. Okay.

22:18.922 --> 22:22.593
-Are you sure you'll be fine alone?
-Yes. I've got the train schedule.

22:24.094 --> 22:27.139
Thanks for this, Alia.
This was so nice for you to do.

22:27.973 --> 22:29.183
Yeah. Of course.

22:30.893 --> 22:32.853
What if we went to see
your old dance company?

22:33.270 --> 22:34.521
What?

22:34.605 --> 22:38.275
They're rehearsing, like, for a new show,
and we used to go and watch.

22:38.734 --> 22:40.402
I bet they'd still let us.

22:40.485 --> 22:43.405
And, well, it could be good
for us to go out together.

22:44.156 --> 22:45.240
Right?

23:01.757 --> 23:03.550
Got a lead we need to check out.

23:11.892 --> 23:13.727
This is the place?

23:13.810 --> 23:14.853
Yep.

23:16.355 --> 23:19.066
It's not going to be easy.

23:19.149 --> 23:20.984
That's what I got you for.

23:40.963 --> 23:41.964
Hey!

23:48.178 --> 23:49.596
You made it.

23:51.515 --> 23:53.141
Never thought we'd be here again.

23:54.101 --> 23:55.102
Do you mind?

24:02.109 --> 24:03.193
I'm excited.

25:21.855 --> 25:25.943
The dancers, they were, like,
free and connected at the same time.

25:26.818 --> 25:29.780
I didn't know bodies could do that.
Mine feels like a trap.

25:30.405 --> 25:34.701
Well, your body used to do that.
Maybe it can again someday.

25:36.245 --> 25:38.163
What about you? Do you dance?

25:38.247 --> 25:42.209
No, no. You do not wanna see me dance.
I'm a freak show.

25:43.210 --> 25:44.503
I'm glad we went.

25:45.629 --> 25:49.049
It's the most beautiful thing
I've seen here, since I woke up.

25:52.344 --> 25:53.345
What is it?

25:55.180 --> 25:57.015
Someone's in there. I can hear 'em.

25:57.558 --> 25:59.560
-How do you know?
-Just stand behind me.

26:10.237 --> 26:11.238
Keys.

26:29.423 --> 26:32.426
Jesus, Cody. What are you doing here?
What the hell happened?

26:32.509 --> 26:35.012
You would know if you answered your phone.
Where were you?

26:36.013 --> 26:39.141
Cody, this is Sara... my mom.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.019
This is Cody.

26:43.020 --> 26:45.189
Hi. Nice to finally meet you, ma'am.

26:46.523 --> 26:48.358
Now are you gonna tell me
what the hell happened?

26:52.905 --> 26:54.323
I'll give you some privacy.

27:07.461 --> 27:09.963
Hey, look, we gotta get outta town.

27:10.047 --> 27:13.050
What? What the hell did you do?
What the hell happened?

27:13.133 --> 27:15.511
I was just trying to make
some money for the car, okay?

27:16.011 --> 27:17.471
What did you do?

27:18.013 --> 27:20.682
I was selling weed for a guy, no big deal.

27:21.099 --> 27:23.101
Well, it is now. Who jumped you?

27:23.185 --> 27:25.521
I don't know.
But they took it all, and it was a lot.

27:26.104 --> 27:28.732
Alia, I'm never gonna be able
to pay him back. We gotta go.

27:29.107 --> 27:31.735
This guy, Jasper,
if I don't get his money,

27:31.818 --> 27:33.195
I don't know what he's gonna do.

27:37.574 --> 27:39.535
-What about this?
-It's not enough.

27:40.077 --> 27:44.122
And I'm not taking it from you.
We need it. LA, no more winters.

27:44.206 --> 27:46.875
Cody, I can't leave my mom.

27:47.376 --> 27:49.169
-You mean Jason Bourne?
-Stop it.

27:49.253 --> 27:50.963
I'm sorry,
but something is wrong with her.

27:51.755 --> 27:53.799
You know,
I'm the one who's been in your corner.

27:53.882 --> 27:55.843
I could really use you in mine.

27:55.926 --> 27:58.136
Cody, please.

27:59.555 --> 28:01.890
Are you really gonna make me
choose right now?

28:03.559 --> 28:05.227
'Cause you know I can't.

28:07.354 --> 28:09.022
Then I'll make it easy on you.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.791
Why are you looking at me like that?

28:28.834 --> 28:32.754
Yep, I'm underage and I get drunk.
This is me.

28:34.089 --> 28:35.507
I'm trying to understand.

28:37.843 --> 28:39.052
You care about that guy,

28:39.136 --> 28:41.930
but you don't wanna leave with him,
even if I wasn't around.

28:42.014 --> 28:43.223
You were listening?

28:44.433 --> 28:46.852
Look, you have no idea
what I've been through.

28:48.562 --> 28:52.983
Cody, he knows me. He gets me.

29:04.369 --> 29:06.121
I'm sorry for eavesdropping.

29:06.997 --> 29:08.415
It's fine. Just...

29:09.166 --> 29:12.377
I'm not who you think I am. Not anymore.

29:15.380 --> 29:16.757
I don't think anything.

29:17.925 --> 29:20.260
I'm not the girl
with all those plans in those videos.

29:25.307 --> 29:27.059
I lied when I said I graduated.

29:29.311 --> 29:31.897
I was on scholarship at St. Alban's.

29:32.564 --> 29:36.109
Like, best damn school in the state.

29:37.736 --> 29:39.238
But I got kicked out.

29:40.280 --> 29:41.281
Why?

29:42.824 --> 29:44.368
'Cause I was alone and angry,

29:44.451 --> 29:47.871
and there were lots of rich kids at school
to jack their rich-kid stuff.

29:49.540 --> 29:50.624
And Cody...

29:52.417 --> 29:53.794
took the blame for me.

29:56.213 --> 29:59.758
Said I was the one with the future.
But I kept doing it.

30:04.471 --> 30:07.558
Probably not what you expected
when you gave up your whole life

30:07.641 --> 30:09.726
so your genius daughter
could go to college.

30:12.062 --> 30:14.231
I know you don't think I understand
what you went through,

30:14.314 --> 30:15.816
and I can't, not really...

30:21.363 --> 30:23.156
I know what it's like to be alone.

30:27.703 --> 30:29.913
I know how far loneliness goes.

30:36.545 --> 30:40.340
Is that what it was like to be in a coma?

30:42.718 --> 30:45.679
Or... was there something before?

30:47.514 --> 30:49.266
Something you never told me?

30:52.352 --> 30:53.770
Let's just say...

30:55.105 --> 30:58.483
before you came into my life,
I was a bit of a loner.

31:01.612 --> 31:05.199
But just because you're alone doesn't mean
you should cling to the wrong person.

31:08.452 --> 31:10.621
So now you know Cody is wrong for me?

31:11.580 --> 31:14.708
I mean, he's wrong if he's driving you
away from the girl with the plan.

31:15.334 --> 31:19.838
The plan is a bust. I'm not gonna become
some brilliant mechanical engineer.

31:20.547 --> 31:24.635
I don't know about that.
You said you're the one with the brains.

31:24.718 --> 31:28.597
You'll figure it out.
It's not written in the stars.

31:29.681 --> 31:30.974
You're in control.

31:31.058 --> 31:32.518
Not Cody...

31:34.353 --> 31:35.854
Not anyone.

31:38.190 --> 31:39.608
Thanks, Mom.

32:13.976 --> 32:17.271
This episode is brought to you
by Cloudspun.

32:17.354 --> 32:20.148
Cloudspun was created
with one goal in mind:

32:20.232 --> 32:23.902
deliver a great night's sleep
at an amazing price.

32:59.104 --> 33:01.106
Okay. Where you going?

33:06.612 --> 33:07.613
Wayne?

34:09.800 --> 34:12.010
-Yeah?
-Does Wayne Wilkes live here?

34:14.137 --> 34:15.848
You're looking for Wayne?

34:17.516 --> 34:20.518
He said he was a friend of my mom's.
From Chicago.

34:21.395 --> 34:23.146
Chicago?

34:23.230 --> 34:25.440
He lived here in Anniston
his whole damn life.

34:25.983 --> 34:27.025
You're sure?

34:27.109 --> 34:30.404
We grew up together.
Prom king and queen, '95.

34:31.237 --> 34:32.822
I knew him like a fish knows water.

34:34.074 --> 34:36.201
Till he fell off that ladder
fixing the roof.

34:37.536 --> 34:40.496
He hit his head,
split it nearly clean open.

34:42.040 --> 34:43.500
Went right into a coma.

34:45.418 --> 34:47.629
Wait, he was in a coma?

34:47.713 --> 34:51.091
Yep. They told me
he was brain-dead, a vegetable.

34:51.175 --> 34:52.926
But I still visited him every day.

34:53.886 --> 34:57.931
And then, five months later,
outta the blue, he just woke up.

34:59.224 --> 35:03.145
It was a miracle. Except for one thing.

35:04.521 --> 35:08.942
-Yeah?
-He woke up... different.

35:10.944 --> 35:12.404
Different? Different how?

35:12.487 --> 35:13.822
Different in that he wasn't him.

35:14.531 --> 35:15.824
Started talking in his sleep,

35:15.908 --> 35:19.912
nonsense about math equations,
stuff he never knew or cared about before.

35:20.787 --> 35:22.247
He just wasn't Wayne.

35:23.290 --> 35:25.542
My Wayne, he loved me.

35:27.044 --> 35:28.045
This Wayne...

35:28.504 --> 35:29.505
This Wayne what?

35:29.588 --> 35:33.509
He wasn't back two weeks before he ran off
with some bitch he picked up at a bar.

35:33.592 --> 35:36.094
Lexa. Lexi. I don't know.

35:36.178 --> 35:41.308
Look, that woman, Lexa? Lexi?
Do you know anything else about her?

35:41.391 --> 35:43.393
Nope. No idea.

35:50.275 --> 35:52.569
Of course I checked for Stone.
That was the first thing I did.

35:58.825 --> 36:00.285
Alexandra.

36:00.369 --> 36:02.412
Alexandra. Alexandra Stone.

36:21.181 --> 36:22.182
You got anything?

36:40.909 --> 36:42.411
They're transferring her.

36:45.664 --> 36:46.874
Tonight.

36:46.957 --> 36:48.876
That's it, then. That's our chance.

36:51.211 --> 36:52.713
Time to do your thing.

36:56.967 --> 36:59.261
What were you doing at the CDC
when she was caught?

37:00.012 --> 37:01.847
Gathering information, same as always.

37:02.723 --> 37:05.851
That's all over now.
This program's been compromised.

37:06.643 --> 37:09.438
We get her and we go.
They're moving her tonight.

37:10.480 --> 37:14.318
It's too soon. I can't access it all yet.
I'm not strong enough.

37:18.572 --> 37:21.992
Nah, that ain't it. It's the girl.

37:25.329 --> 37:27.623
Look, I get it. You know I had a wife.

37:29.374 --> 37:32.085
And I know what we do is... complicated.

37:33.170 --> 37:36.340
These feelings,
you can't just shut 'em off, but...

37:37.216 --> 37:38.217
you have to.

38:07.829 --> 38:08.830
Where were you?

38:09.998 --> 38:10.999
Support group.

38:13.544 --> 38:14.545
And then...

38:15.295 --> 38:18.423
I went to the Legacy Mutual office
for a while.

38:20.801 --> 38:21.802
Here.

38:26.473 --> 38:28.851
You took out a life insurance policy?
Why would you do that?

38:28.934 --> 38:32.229
Unexpected things happen, Alia,
and I want you to be okay...

38:33.397 --> 38:35.315
in case something were to happen to me.

38:35.399 --> 38:38.193
Like if you were to suddenly,
I don't know, disappear maybe?

38:39.987 --> 38:41.405
I know about Wayne.

38:42.531 --> 38:44.533
He didn't leave town.
I saw you hop into his truck.

38:44.616 --> 38:45.617
Alia.

38:45.701 --> 38:47.661
You've been lying to me.

38:47.744 --> 38:51.123
You know things you shouldn't. You're like
a freakin' ham radio in your sleep.

38:51.206 --> 38:53.000
What is it? What's happening, Mom?

38:53.083 --> 38:54.710
-Just tell me.
-Listen to me, Alia.

38:54.793 --> 38:58.088
That woman that you keep hoping
will walk back through that door is gone.

38:59.006 --> 39:02.843
The coma, it changed things.
I'm sorry, but it did.

39:02.926 --> 39:04.761
And she isn't coming back. You understand?

39:04.845 --> 39:06.471
I don't understand a thing.

39:08.140 --> 39:12.436
Well, I'm really sorry. But I just
need you to accept it and move on.

39:12.519 --> 39:13.729
Move on?

39:14.229 --> 39:18.066
You're grown up.
You don't really need a mother.

39:22.654 --> 39:23.989
You're right.

39:24.823 --> 39:26.408
I don't.

39:27.117 --> 39:31.121
I can take care of myself.
Been doing it a long time.

39:40.422 --> 39:42.007
Alia? What the hell?

39:42.090 --> 39:45.135
Let's do it. Let's go.
Can we still get that car?

39:45.219 --> 39:48.430
Slow down. What? What about your mom?

39:48.514 --> 39:50.390
I thought she was your ride-or-die now.

39:50.474 --> 39:53.977
You were right. She was lying.

39:54.937 --> 39:58.065
I was so stupid to think that things
would go back to the way they were.

39:59.816 --> 40:01.026
Well, what happened?

40:01.109 --> 40:05.572
It doesn't matter. None of it.
I was better off before.

40:08.534 --> 40:12.120
Hey, look, I'm sorry.
It's all right. It's okay.

40:13.205 --> 40:14.623
You hear me? It's gonna be okay.

40:17.251 --> 40:19.878
Let's get that car. No more winters.

40:38.021 --> 40:39.481
Told you not to get attached.

40:44.319 --> 40:45.821
No hostiles present.

40:46.321 --> 40:47.739
<c.styledotitalic>Package secure.

40:48.198 --> 40:51.493
<c.styledotitalic>Proceed on current route
to appointed rendezvous.

40:51.577 --> 40:52.744
<c.styledotitalic>Be alert.

40:52.828 --> 40:53.829
Roger that.

40:53.912 --> 40:57.040
We'll make contact
when the package is transferred.

40:58.041 --> 41:00.794
They're on the move. Good. Let's engage.

41:58.644 --> 41:59.770
Go! Move, move!

42:00.395 --> 42:03.023
Stay where you are!
Put your hands over your head!

42:50.320 --> 42:53.323
Only a few minutes.
We'll be outta here with the 9:00 news.

43:04.918 --> 43:05.919
You okay?

43:06.003 --> 43:08.922
They gave me something.
This body's not responding well to it.

43:15.137 --> 43:18.348
The broadcast is going live. Now.

43:19.141 --> 43:22.853
Okay, we only got a window of a few
minutes, and once it closes, we're stuck.

43:24.479 --> 43:25.898
So, ladies first.

43:33.572 --> 43:34.990
What happened to no attachments?

43:35.073 --> 43:37.075
You know I meant people from this world.

43:37.534 --> 43:38.744
Potato, potahto.

43:43.582 --> 43:45.000
I'll see you on the other side.

43:50.047 --> 43:52.257
Quickly. You can't survive long
in this atmosphere.

44:19.826 --> 44:21.328
She's not breathing.

44:22.621 --> 44:25.582
What happens is what was always
gonna happen. You knew this.

44:26.583 --> 44:30.170
But this body,
it was alive when I came here.

44:30.254 --> 44:31.255
Barely.

44:31.880 --> 44:34.716
These casings were nothing more
than empty vessels

44:34.800 --> 44:36.927
being kept alive
by people who couldn't let 'em go.

44:37.010 --> 44:38.220
That's why we chose them.

44:40.138 --> 44:42.266
Come on.
Let's get back to where we belong.

44:46.270 --> 44:47.271
No.

44:48.605 --> 44:49.606
What are you doing?

44:50.399 --> 44:52.985
They can only receive us
for maybe another two minutes.

44:53.569 --> 44:55.153
I'm not stopping you.

44:56.822 --> 45:00.284
You're not Sara. You're not a mom.

45:04.037 --> 45:07.958
The girl will figure it out eventually.
So stop pretending and come home.

45:09.209 --> 45:11.295
Maybe I don't wanna do what I do anymore.

45:15.591 --> 45:18.385
You know we can't leave a trace.
It's against the rules.

45:18.468 --> 45:19.970
It's why they sent you.

45:20.053 --> 45:22.264
I'm... staying.

45:30.063 --> 45:33.233
We don't have time for this. We gotta go.

45:33.317 --> 45:34.443
No.

45:35.819 --> 45:37.905
They're never gonna leave you alone.
You know that, right?

45:38.405 --> 45:40.782
You stay here,
they're gonna come for you and the girl.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.410
Then tell them
they'll have a fight on their hands.

45:45.329 --> 45:46.955
Sara, we are outta time!

45:49.082 --> 45:50.542
Son of a bitch.

46:18.403 --> 46:20.113
I thought you said you knew the numbers.

46:20.197 --> 46:22.741
I do. Just hold on.

46:35.379 --> 46:36.380
We gotta go. Come on!

46:43.762 --> 46:44.763
Hey!

46:46.014 --> 46:47.224
This your girlfriend, bro?

46:48.976 --> 46:50.978
Yeah. Who are you?

46:51.520 --> 46:54.690
I'm the guy
that your boyfriend owes money to.

46:56.567 --> 46:58.068
Come on, man. What the hell?

46:58.151 --> 47:01.572
How 'bout you bring that bag over here?
Now!

47:05.826 --> 47:07.035
Leave her alone.

47:11.832 --> 47:12.833
What the hell?

47:25.721 --> 47:28.056
You aren't my mom, are you?

47:29.558 --> 47:30.767
Alia--

47:38.734 --> 47:42.571
Mom. Mom, hold on, please. Hold on.
Please, please, hold on.

47:42.654 --> 47:44.740
I'm so sorry, Alia.

47:44.823 --> 47:47.826
No, please. Please don't leave me.
Don't leave me. Don't leave me.

47:47.910 --> 47:52.831
Please. Inside, there's paddles.
In the glass. Go get them.

47:55.709 --> 47:56.919
Alia.

47:57.002 --> 47:58.212
No.

48:00.255 --> 48:01.798
No. No.

48:07.846 --> 48:08.972
Okay.

48:10.724 --> 48:12.559
Okay. Okay.

48:14.102 --> 48:15.437
Come on.

48:21.443 --> 48:23.654
-I don't think it's gonna work.
-No!

49:21.336 --> 49:22.546
Junebug?

49:23.338 --> 49:24.339
Mom.

49:26.425 --> 49:27.634
What's going on?

49:28.969 --> 49:29.970
Mom.

49:30.888 --> 49:32.264
Mom.

49:59.583 --> 50:00.667
Mommy.

50:24.816 --> 50:29.029
Patriots, Eagles. Patriots, Broncos.
Patriots, Seahawks.

50:32.407 --> 50:33.617
Ron and Hermione.

50:34.368 --> 50:36.161
Okay, that was way before your accident.

50:36.245 --> 50:40.123
Okay. Don't judge.
I was only on book four.

50:44.211 --> 50:45.337
Can you sign this?

50:46.171 --> 50:48.882
My application for me to repeat
my senior year at public school.

50:49.424 --> 50:51.468
-It's not exactly St. Alban's, but--
-Hey.

50:52.135 --> 50:55.556
You are more today
than I could have ever dreamed of.

50:56.890 --> 50:57.891
Thanks, Mom.

51:08.151 --> 51:09.361
When was this?

51:11.280 --> 51:13.323
At rehearsals. A few weeks ago.

51:15.868 --> 51:18.996
What were they putting on?
And did I like it?

51:20.664 --> 51:26.670
It was <c.styledotitalic>Return to a Strange Land.
And yeah, you loved it.
