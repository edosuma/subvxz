02:00.273 --> 02:02.317
- What kind of school is it?

02:02.317 --> 02:03.028
- Private.

02:06.028 --> 02:08.197
- How do you know him?

02:08.197 --> 02:09.282
- College.

02:10.282 --> 02:13.661
He dated your mom before I did.

02:13.661 --> 02:17.874

tell you, it's about

03:31.322 --> 03:33.783
the fastest deal I've
ever done in my life.

03:33.783 --> 03:35.951
You know, with a
house, most people

03:35.951 --> 03:39.789
want to look every which way
up and down, round and round.

03:39.789 --> 03:41.248
Not you guys, huh?

03:41.248 --> 03:43.626
You come you look, you
like it you take it.

03:43.626 --> 03:44.713
Super fast, huh?

04:05.314 --> 04:07.734
- How long you been up?

04:07.734 --> 04:08.402
- Awhile.

04:10.402 --> 04:13.864
Yeah Paul dropped off
the box of clothes

04:13.864 --> 04:16.325
from the lost and found, I guess

04:16.325 --> 04:19.082
just until we can get
you some new ones.

04:23.082 --> 04:25.503
- Do I wear a uniform?

04:28.503 --> 04:30.505
- It's a fancy place.

04:55.614 --> 04:59.034
- Please don't tell
me this is all boys.

05:05.332 --> 05:06.751
- Okay Wes,
we got books check,

05:06.751 --> 05:10.964
schedule check,
unacceptable shoes check.

05:10.964 --> 05:12.465
- We'll go shopping
right after school.

05:12.465 --> 05:13.549
- Great.

05:13.549 --> 05:16.176
So, you pick a sport yet?

05:16.176 --> 05:19.638
- Yeah, I'm not really
a big sports guy.

05:19.638 --> 05:21.683
- Well, I'm afraid
it's mandatory.

05:21.683 --> 05:23.392
This time of year
your choices are

05:23.392 --> 05:26.186
football, fencing
and cross country.

05:26.186 --> 05:28.231
- Okay, thanks,
Mr. Abernac.

05:28.231 --> 05:31.316
- Good luck, soldier.

05:31.316 --> 05:33.027
- I don't know how to
thank you for this, Paul.

05:34.945 --> 05:36.823
How you holding up?

05:37.823 --> 05:38.741
- Fine.

05:39.741 --> 05:42.787
- Well hopefully a fresh start
will do you both some good.

05:42.787 --> 05:44.873
- I'm sure it will.

06:08.770 --> 06:12.402
- Yes, yes, the first
day hork, gotta love it.

06:14.402 --> 06:16.529
- Alright, alright I'm seeing.

06:16.529 --> 06:20.575
I'm seeing some taquitos,
some zucchini...

06:20.575 --> 06:23.161
You really like
zucchini, huh, new kid?

06:23.161 --> 06:24.037
- I see some jello there.

06:24.037 --> 06:27.332
- That's enough forensic
analysis, gentleman.

06:27.332 --> 06:32.294
- Gotta respect the first
day hork.

06:32.294 --> 06:34.387
- Welcome to cross country.

06:41.387 --> 06:43.597
- How was cross country?

06:43.597 --> 06:45.561
- Oh it was, whatever.

06:48.561 --> 06:52.481
Won't this kind of
remind you of mom?

06:52.481 --> 06:56.277
- It's not that I don't
want to be reminded.

06:56.277 --> 06:58.909
I just want to have
some control over it.

07:02.909 --> 07:04.996
I want you to have the car.

07:06.996 --> 07:09.082
- What do you mean?

07:09.082 --> 07:14.003
- Kid your age aught to
have your own set of wheels.

07:14.003 --> 07:16.674
- How are you gonna get around?

07:18.674 --> 07:21.678
- Previous tenant just
left it behind I guess.

07:21.678 --> 07:25.056
- You know Dad,
I've never seen you

07:25.056 --> 07:27.976
ride a bike in my entire life.

07:27.976 --> 07:31.856
- Well I assure I am
perfectly capable of it.

07:34.856 --> 07:36.527
- See you there.

07:40.697 --> 07:41.780
- Ass hat!

07:41.780 --> 07:42.241
- Sorry.

07:44.241 --> 07:45.870
- God.

07:47.870 --> 07:50.832
- Aw man, you got
Aminheimer for trig?

07:50.832 --> 07:54.669
Better get some nose plugs, guy
smells like a dying warthog.

07:54.669 --> 07:57.799
- Hey Mason, here
comes the circus.

07:59.799 --> 08:00.758
- You know I always expect like

08:00.758 --> 08:02.844
12 midgets to get
out of that thing.

08:02.844 --> 08:07.056
- There's one.

08:07.056 --> 08:10.395
- Hey Goober, when do
the elephants get here?

08:13.395 --> 08:16.234
- Aw man, my
favorite time of day.

08:18.234 --> 08:20.325
Behold the muff truck.

08:25.325 --> 08:27.743
- How come we don't get to
take classes at their school?

08:27.743 --> 08:30.954
- Because we'd never come back.

08:30.954 --> 08:32.039
Good morning. ladies.

08:32.039 --> 08:34.207
- Hey Mason.

08:34.207 --> 08:35.293
- Hey Kim.

08:35.293 --> 08:36.501
- Hey yourself.

08:36.501 --> 08:37.337
- What's up Missy?

08:37.337 --> 08:39.591
- Hey Tommy.

08:50.223 --> 08:51.226
- Hey Lacey.

08:54.145 --> 08:55.896
Shut up.

09:49.659 --> 09:53.499
- And the area of this circle
of course is Pi R squared.

09:56.499 --> 10:00.047
And then multiply by
the height to give us

10:03.047 --> 10:05.342
the volume of the
cylinder right?

10:07.342 --> 10:07.972
Any questions? Yes?

10:10.972 --> 10:12.269
- What's with the belt?

10:16.269 --> 10:18.688
- That's just something I do.

10:19.688 --> 10:21.356
- Freak.

10:22.608 --> 10:24.861
- And it looks like
we're out of time.

10:24.861 --> 10:26.069
You have the
homework and it's on

10:26.069 --> 10:28.207
the website if
you need to check.

11:06.526 --> 11:08.241
- So how goes it so far?

11:12.241 --> 11:14.534
- Great, seem like nice boys.

11:14.534 --> 11:15.663
- They're not.

11:16.663 --> 11:19.249
They're spoiled little snots
who won't have to work

11:19.249 --> 11:20.792
a day in their lives
unless daddy runs off

11:20.792 --> 11:24.587
with the secretary and takes
all the money with him.

11:24.587 --> 11:26.382
Just kidding, of course.

11:28.382 --> 11:32.845
Bill, I don't want to
overstep my bounds but

11:32.845 --> 11:37.808
have you had the chance to
talk to anybody about Jeanie?

11:37.808 --> 11:37.937
- I mean,

11:40.937 --> 11:44.189
you know once in a while
call my brother or--

11:44.189 --> 11:48.778
- I mean a professional,
'cause I happen to know a guy.

11:48.778 --> 11:52.115
Got a flawless reputation,
well respected.

11:52.115 --> 11:53.323
Our health plan will
cover everything

11:53.323 --> 11:54.996
so it won't cost you a dime.

11:57.996 --> 11:59.621
- I don't know.

11:59.621 --> 12:02.625
- Okay look, this
really isn't about you.

12:02.625 --> 12:05.044
You see as long as I
keep up the appearance

12:05.044 --> 12:07.672
of caring about my
staff it maintains

12:07.672 --> 12:11.634
my carefully crafted
image of being a good guy.

12:11.634 --> 12:13.135
- Got it, that makes sense.

12:13.135 --> 12:16.139
- Yeah I knew
you'd understand so

12:16.139 --> 12:18.102
good idea, terrible idea?

12:21.102 --> 12:23.108
- I guess probably a good idea.

12:28.108 --> 12:30.028
- I couldn't help
but notice that those

12:30.028 --> 12:32.196
who didn't do well on the test

12:32.196 --> 12:34.741
are also behind
on their homework.

12:34.741 --> 12:37.994
So if you want to
improve your grade please

12:37.994 --> 12:41.079
I would suggest you pay
attention to your assignments.

12:41.079 --> 12:42.832
Make sense, right? Thank you.

12:42.832 --> 12:47.135
I thought you would agree.

12:54.135 --> 12:57.554
You know I like to think
that I'm a good teacher.

12:57.554 --> 12:59.473
But two students
working together

12:59.473 --> 13:01.851
can sometimes be quite helpful.

13:01.851 --> 13:06.773
How would you like to be Miss
Westmans's homework partner?

13:06.773 --> 13:07.193
- Yeah sure.

13:10.193 --> 13:11.526
- Lacy?

13:11.526 --> 13:12.446
- Yeah.

13:13.446 --> 13:15.702
- Thank you, you can go now.

13:19.702 --> 13:22.956
- Okay so what's up with
that Lacy Westman girl?

13:22.956 --> 13:24.374
- The Princess of Darkness.

13:24.374 --> 13:26.042
- You mean my future wife?

13:26.042 --> 13:30.172
- Dude she would have sex with
you and then eat your head.

13:31.172 --> 13:32.715
- She going out with anybody?

13:32.715 --> 13:34.299
- Yeah Mason.

13:34.299 --> 13:35.677
- They are not going out.

13:35.677 --> 13:37.761
- Oh really well what
would you call it?

13:37.761 --> 13:41.348
- Using her whenever
he feels like it.

13:41.348 --> 13:43.851
- Mrs. Oselle asked me to
be her homework partner.

13:43.851 --> 13:44.894
- Shut up.

13:44.894 --> 13:47.813
- Dude why the hell doesn't
stuff like that happen to me?

13:47.813 --> 13:49.148
- Because you're nasty

13:49.148 --> 13:52.568
and objectionable at
almost every level.

13:52.568 --> 13:53.944
Oh man, we gotta catch up.

13:53.944 --> 13:56.239
You're not gonna
mind if we smoke you?

13:56.239 --> 13:57.866
- Go for it.

13:58.866 --> 14:01.077
- Sucks when the little
guy beats you, doesn't it?

14:01.077 --> 14:03.257
- Good luck with Lacy.

14:21.597 --> 14:23.765
- Hi, I'm Lacy's
homework partner.

14:23.765 --> 14:26.352
- Mom, I got it.

14:26.352 --> 14:28.730
- You didn't say anything
about a homework partner.

14:28.730 --> 14:30.898
- Mom, I have
a homework partner.

14:30.898 --> 14:31.329
Come on.

14:45.329 --> 14:47.289
- You ride horses?

14:47.289 --> 14:48.457
- Look we don't
have to make cordial

14:48.457 --> 14:50.001
chit chat or become
besties okay.

14:50.001 --> 14:52.629
The only reason
I'm doing this is

14:52.629 --> 14:55.088
she said she'd give
me extra credit,

14:55.088 --> 14:56.506
which I need, because if I fail

14:56.506 --> 14:59.010
then I'd have to do
Junior year over again

14:59.010 --> 15:02.640
and I'd rather put my
head in a wood chipper.

15:04.640 --> 15:05.308
- Okay.

15:06.308 --> 15:08.067
- You can use that chair.

15:14.067 --> 15:16.818
I'm sure you've
heard I'm a kind of

15:16.818 --> 15:19.155
freak, slut, basket
case, but I'm afraid

15:19.155 --> 15:21.991
any hope you had of us
having wild gymnastic sex

15:21.991 --> 15:23.996
are destined to be frustrated.

15:26.996 --> 15:27.417
- Gotcha.

15:31.417 --> 15:33.419
- My friends used to
call the version of me

15:33.419 --> 15:36.882
before I met Jeanie
PJ for pre-Jeanie and

15:38.882 --> 15:43.682
the person I became after we
met was AJ for after Jeanie.

15:45.682 --> 15:50.144
Apparently PJ was this
kind of lifeless lump

15:50.144 --> 15:52.150
and AJ was a great, fun guy.

15:57.150 --> 16:00.908
- How long was it between
her diagnoses and death?

16:03.908 --> 16:04.371
- 61 days.

16:09.371 --> 16:10.376
- I'm sorry.

16:13.376 --> 16:16.924
So Bill, neurons, neurons that
fire together wire together.

16:20.924 --> 16:22.928
So when we're happy the
neurons in our brain

16:23.928 --> 16:26.555
align in way that
tends to sustain

16:26.555 --> 16:29.058
that feeling of well being.

16:29.058 --> 16:32.270
The same idea also
applies to depression.

16:32.270 --> 16:35.148
Like what you'd expect
during a period of grief.

16:35.148 --> 16:38.025
Now grief is completely
normal of course.

16:38.025 --> 16:41.862
But a year or more outside
of a grief inducing vent,

16:41.862 --> 16:46.201
I like to see my patients in
more of an emergent posture.

16:47.201 --> 16:47.911
The good news is that
we have a battery

16:48.911 --> 16:50.704
of medications available to us

16:50.704 --> 16:53.582
to help kick start you
in the right direction.

16:53.582 --> 16:55.251
I'd like to write
you a prescription

16:55.251 --> 16:57.377
for something called Lexapro.

16:57.377 --> 17:00.423
It will boost the levels
of serotonin in your brain.

17:00.423 --> 17:01.757
And it's likely that you'll feel

17:01.757 --> 17:04.593
a little bit better by
the next time we meet.

17:04.593 --> 17:07.095
Are you comfortable with that?

17:07.095 --> 17:09.479
- If you think it'll help.

17:15.479 --> 17:16.897
- You hungry, sweetie?

17:16.897 --> 17:18.358
I can fix you a plate.

17:18.358 --> 17:19.566
- You better get
it while you can.

17:19.566 --> 17:21.486
When it comes to your
mom's macaroni salad

17:21.486 --> 17:24.321
I wait for no man or boy.

17:24.321 --> 17:25.864
- So Mom tell us
why of all the things

17:25.864 --> 17:27.617
you could have done
on your birthday

17:27.617 --> 17:31.371
you chose something
as boring as a picnic.

17:32.371 --> 17:36.626
- Because a boring picnic
let's me have my two favorite

17:36.626 --> 17:40.255
people in the whole wide
world all to myself.

17:40.255 --> 17:42.966
Just being me here makes me feel

17:42.966 --> 17:45.136
so very, very very happy.

17:47.136 --> 17:49.221
- Here it comes.

17:49.221 --> 17:52.432
Another Jeanie Palet spontaneous
outburst of affection.

17:52.432 --> 17:53.642
- I just can't help it.

17:55.894 --> 17:58.855
- Okay okay,
make it stop please.

18:08.824 --> 18:10.159
- You hungry, sweetie?

18:10.159 --> 18:11.660
I can fix you a plate.

18:56.581 --> 18:57.251
Okay you ready?

19:00.251 --> 19:03.380
Rules for Wes, part
two, number one.

19:05.380 --> 19:09.055
You will remember that
among life's many joys

19:13.055 --> 19:15.935
it can also be very
hard but just know

19:16.935 --> 19:20.897
it has nothing at
all to do with you.

19:20.897 --> 19:23.113
You, Wes are a
bright shining star.

19:30.113 --> 19:32.496
I'm sorry, can we just stop?

19:37.496 --> 19:39.668
I just love you so much.

19:41.668 --> 19:44.086
Don't ever forget that.

20:09.861 --> 20:12.114
- You guys hear about
Taber's party this weekend?

20:12.114 --> 20:15.535
- Please, it's an
exercise in futility.

20:16.535 --> 20:20.456
I just want to touch
a girl, like this.

20:20.456 --> 20:21.917
- Stop that immediately.

20:22.917 --> 20:25.628
- You know what you
really need, Goob?

20:25.628 --> 20:27.755
You need a girl
you can look up to.

20:30.967 --> 20:34.469
- Oh, speaking of which,
how's it going with Lacy?

20:34.469 --> 20:36.264
- Dude I swear if
you transfer in

20:36.264 --> 20:40.767
from North San Fran-wherever
and bag Lacy Westman

20:40.767 --> 20:43.313
I'm gonna be so pissed.

20:43.313 --> 20:45.648
- Yeah I really don't think
you need to worry about that.

20:45.648 --> 20:47.233
- Dude, you're her tutor.

20:47.233 --> 20:48.525
You're an authority figure.

20:48.525 --> 20:49.651
Chicks love that.

20:49.651 --> 20:53.781
- Think that may be your
fantasy Raf not hers.

20:53.781 --> 20:56.325
- Seriously though,
what's the deal?

20:56.325 --> 20:59.996
- I don't know man,
there is no deal.

20:59.996 --> 21:03.833
I mean as far as I can
tell she hates my guts.

21:04.833 --> 21:08.634
- Yeah man,
welcome to my world.

21:19.724 --> 21:21.309
- You know, it's funny,
you French are supposed

21:21.309 --> 21:23.602
to be so picky about your coffee

21:23.602 --> 21:26.855
but I see you sucking down a
lot of Folgers here, young lady.

21:26.855 --> 21:28.690
- Well, we have to
make do don't we?

21:28.690 --> 21:30.860
- Listen, I got some
primo box seats

21:30.860 --> 21:32.611
for the LA Clips Friday night.

21:32.611 --> 21:33.821
What do you say you an me go out

21:33.821 --> 21:34.863
we get a couple of cadillac--

21:34.863 --> 21:37.617
- Listen I'm very sorry
but I have to discuss

21:37.617 --> 21:41.204
a student right now so
perhaps we can speak later.

21:41.204 --> 21:41.957
Thank you.

21:44.957 --> 21:45.833
Excuse me?

21:46.833 --> 21:48.628
Sorry I know we
haven't officially met,

21:48.628 --> 21:50.045
but if you could
pretend to talk to me

21:50.045 --> 21:53.048
for a minute I would
very much appreciate it.

21:53.048 --> 21:54.676
- Okay.

21:54.676 --> 21:55.968
- I'm Carine Oselle.

21:55.968 --> 21:57.388
- Hi, Bill Palet.

21:58.388 --> 22:00.055
- You know, I don't know if
you have that expression,

22:00.055 --> 22:02.766
but in France sometimes we say

22:02.766 --> 22:05.978
better a stranger
than someone you know.

22:05.978 --> 22:10.819
- Oh yeah, I think our
expression is anyone but him.

22:12.819 --> 22:14.736
- Your son is in
my class, French.

22:14.736 --> 22:15.822
- Yes.

22:15.822 --> 22:16.907
- He's very advanced.

22:17.907 --> 22:20.579
- Well Wes's mother was fluent.

22:22.579 --> 22:23.871
- Was she French?

22:23.871 --> 22:24.707
- No.

22:25.707 --> 22:29.044
Michigander actually but
when she was a little girl

22:31.044 --> 22:33.547
she heard that French
was a romance language.

22:33.547 --> 22:35.466
And she thought
if she learned it

22:35.466 --> 22:37.178
her life would be romantic.

22:39.178 --> 22:40.349
- Nice, and was it?

22:43.349 --> 22:45.227
- I guess it was yes.

22:55.527 --> 22:58.365
- Darwinism is so depressing.

23:00.365 --> 23:01.199
If you just so happen to be born

23:01.199 --> 23:03.578
with the traits
girls deem desirable

23:03.578 --> 23:06.538
then your chin deep in the booty

23:06.538 --> 23:10.752
but if not then your
left out on the fringe

23:10.752 --> 23:13.922
hoping that one of the alpha
males falls off a cliff

23:14.922 --> 23:18.551
or gets eaten by a saber
tooth or some shit.

23:18.551 --> 23:19.636
- Don't forget about being rich.

23:19.636 --> 23:22.976
- That's very true,
instant short cut no doubt.

23:26.976 --> 23:28.352
You know what screw this.

23:28.352 --> 23:31.480
I'm going home so I can study,

23:31.480 --> 23:36.319
get into a good college, get
a good job, and get rich.

23:36.319 --> 23:39.322
It's my only hope at this point.

23:39.322 --> 23:41.532
See you later, masturbator.

23:41.532 --> 23:42.495
- Later.

24:24.617 --> 24:27.957
- Okay that should be...

24:31.957 --> 24:36.716
- Should this be...

24:39.716 --> 24:40.842
Please leave.

24:40.842 --> 24:41.676
- Look I don't want--

24:41.676 --> 24:43.228
- Just wait outside.

24:53.228 --> 24:57.190
- She's
in trouble, isn't she?

24:57.190 --> 24:58.694
- What do you mean?

24:59.694 --> 25:01.072
- For failing French.

25:03.072 --> 25:05.619
- She's not gonna fail.

25:07.619 --> 25:08.871
- You're Wes.

25:09.871 --> 25:09.915
- You're?

25:11.915 --> 25:13.291
- Annabelle.

25:13.291 --> 25:15.834
- There's a girl at my old
school named Annabelle.

25:15.834 --> 25:18.420
We called her Banana Bell.

25:18.420 --> 25:20.422
- That's what Lacy calls me.

25:20.422 --> 25:21.506
- Can I call you that?

25:21.506 --> 25:22.592
- No.

25:22.592 --> 25:23.259
- Why not?

25:24.259 --> 25:28.765
- Because it's a privilege
you haven't earned.

25:29.765 --> 25:30.600
- No one really makes friendly

25:30.600 --> 25:32.768
conversation in
this house do they?

25:35.313 --> 25:38.109
- That means you can go back in.

25:51.120 --> 25:54.248
- Promise me you
won't tell anybody.

25:54.248 --> 25:55.416
- Okay.

25:55.416 --> 25:58.213
- No I need to hear you promise.

26:00.213 --> 26:01.427
- Promise.

26:06.427 --> 26:08.638
- Yo Palet, you
realize it's been like

26:08.638 --> 26:10.974
three weeks since
you last upchucked.

26:10.974 --> 26:14.142
- Oh look at Wes,
growing up so fast.

26:14.142 --> 26:17.067
- Wes, can I talk to
you for a moment?

26:22.067 --> 26:26.489
Hi, I just wanted to ask how
things are going with Lacy.

26:27.489 --> 26:28.825
- They're fine.

26:29.825 --> 26:32.787
- Do you think it's helping?

26:33.787 --> 26:37.457
- Truth is Mrs. Oselle,
I really don't know.

26:37.457 --> 26:39.335
She doesn't say much.

26:40.335 --> 26:41.170
- I see.

26:42.170 --> 26:43.547
Just wanted to check in.

26:43.547 --> 26:45.341
Thank you, Wes.

26:54.016 --> 26:57.870
Mrs. Westman, may
I speak with you?

27:13.870 --> 27:14.746
How are you?

27:15.746 --> 27:16.707
- Fine.

27:17.707 --> 27:20.543
- Working with
Wes, is it helpful?

27:20.543 --> 27:21.960
- Yeah.

27:21.960 --> 27:22.673
- Good.

27:26.673 --> 27:28.051
You know, Lacy, in a lot of ways

27:28.051 --> 27:31.889
you remind me of me
when I was your age.

27:32.889 --> 27:34.556
I think we should stick together

27:34.556 --> 27:38.563
with all these crazy boys
running around right?

27:41.563 --> 27:42.150
So tell me.

27:44.150 --> 27:45.736
How are you?

27:46.736 --> 27:46.909
Really.

27:56.371 --> 27:57.705
Come here.

27:57.705 --> 27:58.538
- I'm sorry.

27:58.538 --> 28:00.999
- No no no, don't apologize.

28:00.999 --> 28:02.418
It's good to cry.

28:02.418 --> 28:06.257
Much better than keeping
all that crap inside, right?

28:08.257 --> 28:10.634
What time you have
to be back to school?

28:10.634 --> 28:11.179
2:15.

28:13.179 --> 28:15.139
- That's good.

28:15.139 --> 28:18.059
That gives us a little time if,

28:18.059 --> 28:20.611
if you'd like to talk a bit.

28:28.611 --> 28:31.488
- Why are you doing this?

28:31.488 --> 28:35.285
- Because I like you and
because I think maybe

28:36.285 --> 28:39.419
you don't have
anyone else to tell.

28:44.419 --> 28:45.295
- Hey.

28:46.295 --> 28:47.756
- Hey.

28:49.756 --> 28:51.008
- Just doing some prep work.

28:51.008 --> 28:54.469
There's too much
shade in the back so

28:54.469 --> 28:58.313
plant the garden here, put
in some lettuce and beans.

29:03.313 --> 29:04.772
- You okay, Dad?

29:04.772 --> 29:05.150
- Yeah.

29:08.150 --> 29:09.987
I don't know, maybe a little

29:11.987 --> 29:12.949
out of it I guess.

29:15.949 --> 29:17.659
Should probably tell the
doc these happy pills

29:17.659 --> 29:20.457
are more like spacey pills.

29:23.457 --> 29:26.335
What a drag your old man is,
huh?

29:26.335 --> 29:28.089
Even on drugs, I'm no fun.

29:30.089 --> 29:30.925
- Look, I really don't need you

29:31.925 --> 29:34.138
to be Mr. Smiley
Face all the time.

29:37.138 --> 29:41.894
- Be nice to get a break from
Mr. Droopy though, wouldn't it?

29:43.894 --> 29:46.438
Tomatoes, lots of
tomatoes, of course.

29:46.438 --> 29:47.523
- Right.

29:47.523 --> 29:49.735
Well Mommatoes technically.

29:50.735 --> 29:52.027
- Still the only
person I've ever known

29:52.027 --> 29:54.656
that eats them like apples.

29:54.656 --> 29:56.282
- Right.

29:56.282 --> 30:00.703
Remember in sixth grade
I got in that fight

30:00.703 --> 30:03.538
'cause someone called
her Hottie Tomatie.

30:03.538 --> 30:05.582
- Yeah, you stuck up for her.

30:05.582 --> 30:06.210
- Yeah.

30:08.210 --> 30:10.838
- She'd be proud of you, Wes.

30:10.838 --> 30:14.306
Making the adjustment to
a whole new everything.

30:21.306 --> 30:25.646
- So exactly how much of
this are you digging up?

30:26.646 --> 30:27.940
- I was thinking all of it.

30:29.940 --> 30:32.025
- All of it, okay.

30:32.025 --> 30:34.736
Well let's get to it then,
right?

30:34.736 --> 30:35.706
- Feel free.

30:44.706 --> 30:46.082
- What?

30:46.082 --> 30:49.419
- Did you say something
to Mrs. Rousou about me?

30:49.419 --> 30:50.171
- No.

30:53.171 --> 30:55.300
Well she did ask about you?

30:55.300 --> 30:56.802
- What'd she say?

30:57.802 --> 31:00.596
- She asked how all
of this was going.

31:00.596 --> 31:02.600
- What'd you say?

31:03.600 --> 31:05.435
- I said I don't know.

31:05.435 --> 31:07.227
- Why would you say that?

31:07.227 --> 31:09.692
- 'Cause I don't, I guess.

31:13.692 --> 31:15.320
You mad?

31:15.320 --> 31:17.738
- Why would I me mad?

31:17.738 --> 31:19.115
- I don't know.

31:20.115 --> 31:23.287
Some people really
don't need a reason.

31:25.287 --> 31:26.997
She say something to you?

31:31.960 --> 31:33.963
- You know,
whenever I talk to you

31:33.963 --> 31:36.466
it kind of feels like
I'm on some dumb cop show

31:36.466 --> 31:36.926
and you're like
the surly suspect

31:37.926 --> 31:41.429
who doesn't want to
give up any information.

31:42.429 --> 31:45.224
- She was just being really
nice and I was wondering

31:45.224 --> 31:49.479
if you had said something
about what you saw.

31:50.479 --> 31:52.565
- I promised I wouldn't.

31:55.025 --> 31:56.486
- Yeah?

31:56.486 --> 31:57.778
- Dinner time.

31:57.778 --> 31:59.322
- I'm not hungry.

31:59.322 --> 32:00.614
- You are
hungry and you're eating.

32:00.614 --> 32:02.199
I'm not raising an anorexic.

32:02.199 --> 32:03.659
- She said you are
hungry, you're eating,

32:03.659 --> 32:05.328
and she's not
raising an anorexic.

32:05.328 --> 32:06.706
- Yeah I heard her.

32:08.706 --> 32:10.667
Mom Wes is here.

32:10.667 --> 32:13.342
- So, he
eats doesn't he?

32:20.342 --> 32:23.721
- Well this should
be interesting.

32:24.721 --> 32:28.601
- Sorry for the complete
absence of flavor, Wes.

32:28.601 --> 32:31.354
It was Lacy's
fathers turn to cook.

32:32.354 --> 32:35.525
- Lacy, why don't you
tell your mother that

32:35.525 --> 32:38.695
paying the mortgage,
credit cards, tuition,

32:38.695 --> 32:41.322
every other bill that
comes in to this house,

32:41.322 --> 32:43.240
it doesn't leave me much time

32:43.240 --> 32:46.244
to cultivate my culinary skills.

32:46.244 --> 32:48.204
- Why don't you
tell her yourself?

32:48.204 --> 32:52.041
- So Wes, are your
parents still together?

32:52.041 --> 32:54.960
- Barbara and Davis are
getting a divorce but

32:54.960 --> 32:59.470
on the advice of council
neither is willing to move out.

33:05.470 --> 33:07.936
- My mom passed away last year.

33:11.936 --> 33:14.563
- I'm sorry to hear that, Wes.

33:14.563 --> 33:15.774
- I'm sorry too.

33:16.774 --> 33:19.825
The difference is
I actually mean it.

33:26.825 --> 33:29.329
- Tell me about the belt.

33:29.329 --> 33:31.121
- That's a Jeanie thing.

33:31.121 --> 33:35.419
She used to tease me because
my belt would kind of

33:36.419 --> 33:39.464
drift over that way
as the day went on.

33:39.464 --> 33:40.756
Said I should just
start out the day

33:40.756 --> 33:42.300
with it where it
was gonna end up.

33:42.300 --> 33:46.512
So one day I just
started out with it there

33:46.512 --> 33:47.931
and made her laugh.

33:48.931 --> 33:51.184
She said it was
only fitting because

33:51.184 --> 33:54.437
I was a little off
center to begin with.

33:54.437 --> 33:56.022
- She had a good sense of humor.

33:56.022 --> 33:57.314
- Yeah.

33:57.314 --> 33:57.900
- Okay.

33:58.900 --> 34:01.444
So I find that grieving spouses

34:01.444 --> 34:03.947
usually fall into
one of two groups.

34:03.947 --> 34:05.530
One describes
their loved one as

34:05.530 --> 34:07.950
someone who filled
a void in them.

34:07.950 --> 34:09.952
The other describes
them as someone who

34:09.952 --> 34:13.414
added a dimension to the
person they already were.

34:13.414 --> 34:17.293
Which would you say
best describes you?

34:17.293 --> 34:17.918
- It's both.

34:18.918 --> 34:21.797
- Which would you say you favor?

34:22.797 --> 34:24.882
- All of the above.

34:24.882 --> 34:26.804
- Okay, fair enough.

34:27.804 --> 34:32.641
I'm just looking for
something to help us move on.

34:32.641 --> 34:33.601
- From what?

34:34.601 --> 34:37.103
- From your wife, Bill.

34:37.103 --> 34:39.023
The only way you're
going to feel better

34:39.023 --> 34:43.735
is if we figure out someway
for you to let her go.

34:43.735 --> 34:46.322
You recognize that don't you?

34:46.322 --> 34:47.699
- Yes.

34:49.699 --> 34:50.079
- Okay.

34:53.079 --> 34:56.164
As for the Lexapro finding
the right medication

34:56.164 --> 34:58.751
can sometimes be a trial
and error process so

34:58.751 --> 35:01.671
I'm gonna switch you
something called Cymbalta

35:01.671 --> 35:04.590
see if that works
better for you.

35:04.590 --> 35:05.429
- Fine.

35:09.429 --> 35:10.889
- Bill?

35:11.889 --> 35:12.682
- Hello.

35:13.682 --> 35:15.351
- What a coincidence.

35:15.351 --> 35:17.186
Back home I'm used to
running into people

35:17.186 --> 35:20.523
but here it always
gives me a surprise.

35:20.523 --> 35:22.483
- Next.

35:22.483 --> 35:23.735
- Excuse me.

35:24.735 --> 35:28.034
Hi Palet, P-A-L-E-T.

35:31.034 --> 35:31.372
- $10.

35:37.372 --> 35:41.126
- Bill I'm sorry to
bother you like this but

35:41.126 --> 35:43.713
I have a favor to ask.

35:43.713 --> 35:47.718
You know Coach Keith,
big muscles small brain.

35:48.718 --> 35:50.302
- Extra large coffee mug.

35:50.302 --> 35:52.430
- Yes,
ridiculous that mug.

35:52.430 --> 35:53.889
- More of a jug really.

35:53.889 --> 35:56.184
- I think you could
actually bathe a cat in it.

35:56.184 --> 35:58.602
Anyways he asked
me out for Friday

35:58.602 --> 36:01.856
and I'm desperate for
a reason to say no

36:01.856 --> 36:05.072
but I'm afraid I'm
running out of excuses.

36:09.072 --> 36:12.242
- Oh so you want me
to be your excuse?

36:13.242 --> 36:15.285
- Would you mind terribly?

36:15.285 --> 36:18.372
- No that's, sure that's fine.

36:18.372 --> 36:20.124
- Unless you're busy of course.

36:20.124 --> 36:22.256
- No I'm not busy ever.

36:27.256 --> 36:30.385
I generally eat in the evenings.

36:31.385 --> 36:34.055
We could eat together.

36:34.055 --> 36:37.557
- Yes we can eat together,
that sounds very nice.

36:37.557 --> 36:41.186
- Great okay, I'll
see you tomorrow.

36:41.186 --> 36:43.606
- Yes see you tomorrow.

36:44.606 --> 36:46.318
- Alright number four.

36:47.318 --> 36:49.528
- I have no idea
how to say that.

36:53.282 --> 36:55.742
Do I have to say it like that?

36:55.742 --> 36:57.202
- Like what?

36:57.202 --> 36:58.329
- Like I'm an
effeminate French man

36:58.329 --> 36:59.539
who's in love with himself?

36:59.539 --> 37:01.291
- Oh that, yeah yeah, you do.

37:01.291 --> 37:02.791
You have to say it like
you're an effeminate

37:02.791 --> 37:04.126
French man who's in
love with himself.

37:04.126 --> 37:08.764
- Then I've got the perfect
homework partner don't I?

37:16.764 --> 37:17.640
- You okay?

37:18.640 --> 37:19.646
- I'm fine.

37:23.646 --> 37:25.814
- Why do you do that?

37:25.814 --> 37:27.610
- Do what?

37:28.610 --> 37:29.155
- Your arm.

37:33.155 --> 37:35.240
- 'Cause I'm happy,
well adjusted,

37:35.240 --> 37:38.119
and really excited
about my future.

37:38.119 --> 37:39.329
Of course I'm a
little upset that

37:39.329 --> 37:41.497
I didn't make
cheerleader this year but

37:41.497 --> 37:42.999
there's always next
year and I feel like

37:42.999 --> 37:43.918
if I work really really hard

37:44.918 --> 37:47.677
it could definitely
happen for me.

37:54.677 --> 37:59.432
- So you're telling me
nothing has happened at all.

37:59.432 --> 38:00.809
- Nope.

38:01.809 --> 38:02.936
- You do realize what
a fail this is right?

38:03.936 --> 38:07.231
Not to mention how personally
disappointing this is for me.

38:07.231 --> 38:11.193
You've been with this
girl for over 10 hours.

38:11.193 --> 38:12.361
That's more time than Goober's

38:12.361 --> 38:14.197
spent with a girl
his entire life.

38:14.197 --> 38:17.617
- Hey Palet, tops on
your strategy man.

38:18.617 --> 38:20.037
- What strategy?

38:21.037 --> 38:23.206
- You know, start off
with the psycho whore

38:23.206 --> 38:26.251
and work you way up from there.

38:26.251 --> 38:28.836
Yeah I just hope you're
banging her by now.

38:28.836 --> 38:33.052
Trust me it doesn't take half
the work you're putting in.

38:37.052 --> 38:40.682
- That's the other thing
I hate about evolution.

38:40.682 --> 38:44.227
Why does the dominant male
always have to be a dick?

38:44.227 --> 38:44.936
What does persistence
dickishness

38:45.936 --> 38:49.858
have to do with
furthering the species?

38:51.858 --> 38:52.693
- Hey Mason.

39:01.660 --> 39:03.704
- Break it
up, break it up.

39:03.704 --> 39:06.081
Get off, break it up,
come on break it up.

39:06.081 --> 39:07.918
That's it, that's it,
that's it, break it off.

39:08.918 --> 39:10.421
- Easy easy, boys.

39:11.421 --> 39:16.383
- What the hell's
the matter with you guys?

39:16.383 --> 39:20.849
So which one of you Nobel
Lureates started this?

39:22.849 --> 39:25.559
- That depends, sir ,do you
mean verbally or physically?

39:25.559 --> 39:27.644
- Shut up Raffi!

39:27.644 --> 39:29.771
I don't really care
who started this.

39:29.771 --> 39:31.691
I already talked
to the other three.

39:31.691 --> 39:34.610
And if there is so much
as glancing contact

39:34.610 --> 39:36.486
between any of you knuckleheads

39:36.486 --> 39:38.947
both parties will be expelled.

39:38.947 --> 39:40.115
Is that clear?

39:40.115 --> 39:42.242
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

39:42.242 --> 39:46.789
- Expelled, as in gee why
didn't I get in to college?

39:46.789 --> 39:48.376
Oh right, I got expelled.

39:50.376 --> 39:52.378
Now I can spend the
rest of my sad life

39:52.378 --> 39:55.965
selling mangos from the
side of the freeway.

39:55.965 --> 40:00.177
In the meantime welcome
to disciplinary probation.

40:00.177 --> 40:04.057
You'll also be serving weekend
detention on litter patrol.

40:04.057 --> 40:05.892
Everybody happy?

40:05.892 --> 40:06.102
- Yes, sir.

40:08.936 --> 40:11.021
- Well sir, according
to the honor code

40:11.021 --> 40:13.316
we're supposed to be
honest at all times.

40:13.316 --> 40:17.530
But if I told you I
was happy I'd be lying.

40:20.530 --> 40:22.242
I'm very happy.

40:22.242 --> 40:23.702
- Be gone.

40:29.331 --> 40:31.668
- The truth is I
always imagined that

40:31.668 --> 40:35.213
I would be fantastically
good at marriage.

40:35.213 --> 40:36.256
- You weren't?

40:37.256 --> 40:39.718
- Well it began pretty good and

40:40.718 --> 40:43.554
we found out I could
not have children and

40:43.554 --> 40:47.559
it wasn't so good after
that so I became a teacher.

40:48.559 --> 40:50.979
If you can't be a mother
to one be a mother to many.

40:50.979 --> 40:52.854
How long were you married?

40:52.854 --> 40:53.191
- 33 years.

40:56.191 --> 40:59.028
- Practically a lifetime.

40:59.028 --> 41:02.034
- Well I guess so but
never felt that way.

41:05.034 --> 41:08.787
- What an amazing thing
to be able to say.

41:25.512 --> 41:28.057
We're talking about
the food, but you know.

41:33.896 --> 41:36.231
- Okay so I obviously
didn't understand

41:36.231 --> 41:40.570
more than two words of
that but this is a little--

41:40.570 --> 41:41.488
- Awkward.

41:42.488 --> 41:43.947
I mean I love the
French but one thing

41:43.947 --> 41:46.450
that drives me crazy is how
they babble on endlessly

41:46.450 --> 41:49.077
as if anyone around who
doesn't speak French

41:49.077 --> 41:52.164
is simply a piece of furniture.

41:52.164 --> 41:53.166
- Well I do have
more in common with

41:53.166 --> 41:54.918
a La-Z-boy chair
than I like to admit.

41:55.918 --> 41:57.586
- I am that way too.

41:57.586 --> 41:59.923
I mean give me a nice cozy
chair and a good book.

42:00.923 --> 42:03.760
And you'll need a tow
truck to get me to move.

42:03.760 --> 42:06.262
- So I guess we
have that in common.

42:06.262 --> 42:10.974
General unwillingness to move
unless absolutely necessary.

42:10.974 --> 42:13.269
- Sometimes I look
at those little fish

42:13.269 --> 42:17.025
you know stuck to the side of
the aquarium, you know the...

42:19.025 --> 42:22.528
And I'm like maybe it's
not such a bad life.

42:22.528 --> 42:25.280
- Really, a sucker
fish, not a bad life?

42:25.280 --> 42:27.032
- No, I mean, okay of
course it's bound

42:27.032 --> 42:30.285
to become a little monotonous,
but think about it.

42:30.285 --> 42:30.912
How stressful can it be?

42:31.912 --> 42:34.374
- Well that is
definitely a valid point.

42:34.374 --> 42:36.919
- I mean you have only one job.

42:42.048 --> 42:42.048
Do you like it?

42:42.881 --> 42:43.840
- Yes excellent, very good.

42:43.840 --> 42:45.425
- I can do a guppy, a guppy.

42:45.425 --> 42:47.610
- Oh guppies are fun.

43:10.034 --> 43:10.412
- Hey.

43:12.412 --> 43:14.539
- When'd you get back?

43:14.539 --> 43:16.876
- A little while ago.

43:18.876 --> 43:20.963
- So, how'd the big date go?

43:22.963 --> 43:24.881
- It went well.

43:24.881 --> 43:25.593
- Well?

43:26.593 --> 43:29.470
Is that a smile I'm seeing?

43:29.470 --> 43:31.309
- She's very nice.

43:34.309 --> 43:39.188
What can I say, maybe these
happy pills are working.

43:39.188 --> 43:42.650
- That'd be good, right?

43:42.650 --> 43:43.657
- Yeah, sure.

43:50.657 --> 43:53.202
How's the running going?

43:53.202 --> 43:56.457
- I'm starting to
kinda like it actually.

43:58.457 --> 44:02.211
Just wish I was a
little better but...

44:02.211 --> 44:05.798
- Maybe that's something
we can work on.

44:05.798 --> 44:08.383
- We, like me and you?

44:08.383 --> 44:12.389
- Yeah like, doctor Rollins
said I should starts exercising.

44:13.389 --> 44:16.351
Maybe we could run together.

44:16.351 --> 44:18.604
- Yeah, yeah, if you want.

44:20.604 --> 44:23.693
- Okay, now what
about this fight?

44:25.693 --> 44:27.611
- Yeah, no, I know Dad,
it's just,

44:27.611 --> 44:30.448
God this guy he's such a, he's a

44:31.448 --> 44:33.325
what's that thing
Mom used to call

44:33.325 --> 44:35.035
someone she like
really couldn't stand?

44:35.035 --> 44:35.994
- Dingus.

44:35.994 --> 44:35.994
- A dingus, Dad.

44:36.829 --> 44:41.501
This guy I mean he's so much
worse than a dingus it's crazy.

44:42.501 --> 44:43.921
- Okay, but

44:44.921 --> 44:47.090
that doesn't make it
a smart thing to do.

44:47.090 --> 44:50.847
- I know, yeah, it's
just it was stupid.

44:55.847 --> 44:56.101
Okay.

44:58.101 --> 45:02.646
Hey Dad, do you mind if kind
of throw some advice your way

45:02.646 --> 45:05.860
if you're gonna
start dating women?

45:08.860 --> 45:12.282
You gotta lose
those tighty whiteys.

45:12.282 --> 45:13.782
- Why?

45:13.782 --> 45:17.077
- Well because it's
practically a universal law

45:17.077 --> 45:21.709
that no man has ever
looked good in man panties.

45:23.709 --> 45:25.461
- I'm not sure I
agree with that.

45:25.461 --> 45:28.213
- Well it's just the thing is
it's not really an opinion.

45:28.213 --> 45:29.506
It's kind of a fact.

45:29.506 --> 45:33.218
It's like you can't like
disagree with it, you know.

45:33.218 --> 45:34.637
- I don't know.

45:34.637 --> 45:39.392
- Don't start, don't start with
that Dad please stop, okay.

45:39.392 --> 45:43.186
Dad I'm begging you
stop that immediately.

45:43.186 --> 45:44.314
- It's too late it's started,
once it's started--

45:44.314 --> 45:46.148
- Yeah yeah ,alright,
that's my cue.

45:46.148 --> 45:48.653
Alright, night.
See you tomorrow.

45:50.653 --> 45:52.405
- Pleasant dreams.

46:02.122 --> 46:04.334
- You always run this fast?

46:04.334 --> 46:06.713
- This is not fast.

46:09.713 --> 46:11.215
- Okay, what about breaks?

46:11.215 --> 46:12.342
You take breaks?

46:12.342 --> 46:13.679
- Nope, no breaks.

46:16.679 --> 46:19.640
- This is just not gonna work.

46:19.640 --> 46:20.474
- You okay?

46:20.474 --> 46:21.392
- Yeah yeah, go ahead.

46:21.392 --> 46:22.226
- You sure?

46:22.226 --> 46:24.354
- Go go go, enjoy.

46:24.354 --> 46:25.354
- Alright.

46:25.354 --> 46:26.191
- Oh, good Lord.

46:36.698 --> 46:39.327
Hey hey, how do you like this?

46:40.327 --> 46:42.372
Come on, Usain Bolt,
let's pick up the pace.

46:42.372 --> 46:44.666
- Dad you're on a bike, okay.

46:44.666 --> 46:47.461
- Yeah, I'm also
way older than you.

46:48.461 --> 46:49.048
What the heck?

46:52.048 --> 46:54.760
Are you trying to ditch me?

46:55.760 --> 46:57.052
Come on, pick it up.

46:57.052 --> 46:58.972
Pick it up, pick it up.

47:05.102 --> 47:06.898
- Hey jackass.

47:08.898 --> 47:11.191
Starting a fight
to defend my honor.

47:11.191 --> 47:15.195
Like you're some doofus knight
from medieval fantasy land.

47:15.195 --> 47:16.655
- He's a dick.

47:16.655 --> 47:20.246
- Your a dumb ass who's lucky
to still have all his teeth.

47:23.246 --> 47:24.414
- Where are you going?

47:24.414 --> 47:26.880
- You'll see.

47:32.880 --> 47:34.300
- What is it?

47:35.300 --> 47:36.769
- Find out.

47:47.769 --> 47:47.938
- Are you serious?

47:48.938 --> 47:52.316
- I'm trying to reduce
your dork factor.

47:52.316 --> 47:53.943
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you look

47:53.943 --> 47:56.445
driving around without
a passenger seat?

47:56.445 --> 47:57.863
- This is awesome.

47:57.863 --> 48:00.115
I mean,
where'd you even find it?

48:00.115 --> 48:02.744
- Some creepy old
man on Craiglist.

48:02.744 --> 48:04.077
You totally owe me.

48:04.077 --> 48:05.204
- Yeah I do.

48:06.204 --> 48:07.418
Thank you.

48:10.418 --> 48:11.253
- Awkward.

48:13.253 --> 48:15.633
- I was gonna hug you.

48:16.633 --> 48:18.635
- You're allowed.

48:23.805 --> 48:24.807
- Shit.

48:24.807 --> 48:26.517
- Watch your language.

48:26.517 --> 48:28.394
- Why? You say
shit all the time?

48:28.394 --> 48:29.025
- Shut up.

48:34.025 --> 48:36.360
- Wes what's taking so long?

48:36.360 --> 48:38.988
- The holes don't line up.

- I'll slice and

49:53.563 --> 49:55.648
- Why do they call
it litter patrol

49:55.648 --> 49:58.026
if they never pick up litter?

49:58.026 --> 50:02.697
- It's more about being
prepared to pick it up.

50:03.697 --> 50:05.867
- That's litter.

50:05.867 --> 50:08.660
- Well he likes to give
it a head start first.

50:08.660 --> 50:09.921
- Fine, I'll do it.

50:18.921 --> 50:20.673
- Thanks for coming.

50:20.673 --> 50:22.468
It's a lot less boring.

50:23.468 --> 50:24.635
- You mean you don't
enjoy homoerotic

50:24.635 --> 50:25.930
jousting with your buddies?

50:26.930 --> 50:30.140
- You know, I'm just not quite
as good at it as they are.

50:30.140 --> 50:31.938
- I seriously doubt that.

50:34.938 --> 50:38.903
- So Mr. Abernac, he's having
a birthday dinner for may dad.

50:42.903 --> 50:46.865
And I figured you
know after all the

50:46.865 --> 50:50.287
amazing help that I've
given you in French

50:51.287 --> 50:53.086
that maybe you could come.

50:58.086 --> 51:00.546
- Oh my God, did
you just invite me

51:00.546 --> 51:02.968
to a calculus teacher's
birthday party?

51:04.968 --> 51:05.302
- Yeah.

51:07.302 --> 51:08.389
Yeah, I did.

51:10.389 --> 51:13.476
- I don't know, Wes, I mean,
I'm a big girl and all but

51:13.476 --> 51:15.727
that just sounds batshit crazy.

51:15.727 --> 51:17.981
You know math teachers you
get them drunk and then

51:17.981 --> 51:19.648
next thing you know
they're playing

51:19.648 --> 51:23.695
spin the compass and
hide the protractor.

51:24.695 --> 51:25.530
- The girl is mine.

51:25.530 --> 51:29.660
- Nay, all young
wenches belong to me.

51:30.660 --> 51:32.622
- So is that a yes or?

51:35.622 --> 51:37.834
- A yes I suppose,

51:38.834 --> 51:42.631
if you can promise me
I'll live through it.

51:44.631 --> 51:46.425
- Everything was
delicious, Missy.

51:46.425 --> 51:48.093
- Yes, very
good thank you.

51:48.093 --> 51:49.387
- I'm glad, everyone deserves

51:49.387 --> 51:51.305
a good dinner for
their birthday.

51:51.305 --> 51:53.557
- Speaking of, one more.

51:53.557 --> 51:54.892
- Ah.

51:54.892 --> 51:57.644
- Wes, I just gave
the man bookends.

51:57.644 --> 52:00.189
Why in the world would you
try to compete with that?

52:00.189 --> 52:01.358
- Ah.

52:03.358 --> 52:04.610
- Those are hot.

52:04.610 --> 52:05.695
- They are.

52:05.695 --> 52:07.822
- Wes is trying to
convert me to boxers.

52:07.822 --> 52:11.242
- Bill please tell me you're
not still wearing grippers.

52:11.242 --> 52:12.535
- I guess I am.

52:12.535 --> 52:13.869
Thank you, Son.

52:13.869 --> 52:15.412
- Your welcome, Father.

52:15.412 --> 52:16.747
- Well done, Wes.

52:16.747 --> 52:18.832
Now if you could just do
something about the belt.

52:18.832 --> 52:20.334
- No no no, don't lose the belt.

52:20.334 --> 52:21.168
- Are you kidding?

52:21.168 --> 52:21.921
It looks like my calculus
teacher downs three shots

52:22.921 --> 52:25.048
of vodka before he gets
dressed every morning.

52:25.048 --> 52:26.506
- Well it's actually gin, Paul.

52:26.506 --> 52:31.220
- Excuse me, but a man
without quirks is boring.

52:31.220 --> 52:32.220
- She's right.

52:32.220 --> 52:34.724
Everyone's entitled to a
few little weirdnesses.

52:34.724 --> 52:36.726
- Like father, like son.

52:36.726 --> 52:38.727
- Excuse me, weirdnesses?

52:38.727 --> 52:40.563
- Hello, backward car seat.

52:40.563 --> 52:42.981
- Hello, you're the one
who gave that to me.

52:42.981 --> 52:44.691
- Okay, pretending
to be a pirate.

52:44.691 --> 52:46.860
- Okay that, that wasn't me.

52:46.860 --> 52:49.572
- Whatever, effeminate
French accent.

52:49.572 --> 52:51.615
- There's a lesson here, Wes.

52:51.615 --> 52:53.284
If you expose your
vulnerabilities

52:53.284 --> 52:56.537
to a woman, you
will be eviscerated.

52:56.537 --> 53:00.499
They are a ruthless
cold blooded gender.

53:00.499 --> 53:02.584
- Okay it has nothing to do with

53:02.584 --> 53:05.421
the temperature
of our blood okay.

53:05.421 --> 53:08.215
Men are just afraid
of strong women.

53:08.215 --> 53:09.883
They think because
we stand up to them

53:09.883 --> 53:11.177
that means we don't
like them when

53:11.177 --> 53:13.972
half the time it means
it the exact opposite.

53:13.972 --> 53:16.182
- You know, Bill, for
such a mild mannered guy

53:16.182 --> 53:19.309
you sure attract
some feisty women.

53:19.309 --> 53:22.438
I remember being with Jeanie
one night at some bar.

53:22.438 --> 53:24.856
And this giant lecherous redneck

53:24.856 --> 53:26.776
would just not leave us alone.

53:26.776 --> 53:30.113
And finally she said you're
bound to have better luck

53:30.113 --> 53:31.697
at the Natural History Museum.

53:31.697 --> 53:33.448
There's a few gals in there at

53:33.448 --> 53:35.117
the neanderthal
exhibit who would think

53:35.117 --> 53:37.662
you're the greatest
thing that walks upright

53:37.662 --> 53:39.497
and talks at the same time.

53:44.376 --> 53:47.890
- She did have a way with words.

53:58.890 --> 54:01.144
Thank you for the ride.

54:01.144 --> 54:03.648
- Thanks for inviting me.

54:06.648 --> 54:10.485
Your wife sounds like
a very special person.

54:10.485 --> 54:13.655
I cannot think how big
a hole must be left

54:13.655 --> 54:16.285
after losing someone like that.

54:18.285 --> 54:20.836
- Thank you for saying that.

54:26.836 --> 54:29.798
I actually bought
you some flowers

54:31.798 --> 54:34.849
but then I forget
I left them inside.

54:39.849 --> 54:44.686
- Is that some kind of sneaky
way to invite me to come in?

54:44.686 --> 54:45.151
- No, no, I--

54:50.151 --> 54:53.698
No, but, would you
like to come in?

54:58.075 --> 54:59.535
- You know
I cannot believe

54:59.535 --> 55:01.246
you said I like
pretending to be a pirate.

55:01.246 --> 55:02.121
- Please, if I wasn't there you

55:02.121 --> 55:04.374
totally would have
been doing it.

55:04.374 --> 55:06.918
- Yeah okay, it's probably true.

55:07.918 --> 55:10.046
- So what's the deal
with your dad and Carine?

55:10.046 --> 55:13.508
I mean she's clearly
got a crush on him.

55:13.508 --> 55:14.220
- Yes.

55:18.220 --> 55:19.099
- What?

55:21.099 --> 55:22.892
- I don't know.

55:22.892 --> 55:24.727
He tries to fake it but

55:25.727 --> 55:30.276
inside he's still just nuked.

55:31.276 --> 55:32.236
- You both must be.

55:34.236 --> 55:38.450
- You know, for a long time
we barely even talked.

55:39.450 --> 55:43.622
We didn't go anywhere,
we didn't do anything.

55:45.622 --> 55:49.463
Then one day I just
started doing stuff again.

55:53.463 --> 55:55.137
I kind of felt bad about it.

55:59.137 --> 56:01.764
Like maybe he'd think I
didn't deserve as much.

56:01.764 --> 56:03.807
That wasn't it,

56:03.807 --> 56:07.816
I just can't think about
it all the time you know.

56:12.816 --> 56:16.655
All that does is just
makes it even worse.

56:38.718 --> 56:40.093
What?

56:40.093 --> 56:42.265
- I don't want to do that.

56:45.265 --> 56:45.936
- Why not?

56:48.936 --> 56:52.316
- Because if we do
then you tell somebody

56:53.316 --> 56:54.858
and then they tell somebody
and then pretty soon

56:54.858 --> 56:56.318
the whole school will find out

56:56.318 --> 56:58.655
and then it just
becomes another episode

56:58.655 --> 57:01.073
of let's drink crappy
beer and make out.

57:01.073 --> 57:04.827
High school bullshit
that doesn't mean
anything to anybody.

57:04.827 --> 57:05.662
- So you think I'm the guy that

57:05.662 --> 57:07.287
goes to school and
tells everybody.

57:07.287 --> 57:09.624
- No, I don't know maybe.

57:10.624 --> 57:12.001
- I'm not.

57:12.001 --> 57:13.836
- Yeah, I know I'm just.

57:13.836 --> 57:14.881
- Just what?

57:17.881 --> 57:21.097
- I'd like this to
be better than that.

57:24.097 --> 57:25.724
Look, I like you, okay.

57:27.724 --> 57:30.854
You're gonna make
me say it out loud.

57:31.854 --> 57:33.443
I'd like to go slow.

57:37.443 --> 57:38.820
- Okay.

57:39.820 --> 57:40.530
So.

57:41.530 --> 57:45.285
What you're saying is
that you like me so much

57:45.285 --> 57:47.372
that you don't want to kiss me.

57:49.372 --> 57:51.206
- Something like that.

57:51.206 --> 57:52.584
- Okay.

57:52.584 --> 57:55.880
I mean at least
not again tonight.

57:57.880 --> 57:59.840
- That's right.

57:59.840 --> 58:00.718
- But,

58:01.718 --> 58:02.510
maybe,

58:03.510 --> 58:04.220
possibly,

58:05.220 --> 58:06.014
later.

58:07.014 --> 58:09.188
- Yes Wesley, maybe
possibly later.

58:14.188 --> 58:16.535
- That's all I needed to know.

58:28.535 --> 58:32.331
- I like what you've
done with the place.

58:32.331 --> 58:33.459
- Yes, thank you.

58:35.459 --> 58:38.671
I think it's called
negligent minimalism.

58:38.671 --> 58:40.965
- I hear it's all the
rage in German prisons.

58:59.441 --> 59:00.610
Would you excuse me?

59:00.610 --> 59:02.124
- Of course, yeah.

59:15.124 --> 59:16.126
- Bill.

59:18.126 --> 59:19.595
- Yes.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.133
Was being with her

01:00:06.133 --> 01:00:08.845
something you wanted to happen?

01:00:08.845 --> 01:00:10.512
- Yes.

01:00:10.512 --> 01:00:12.307
- Why?

01:00:13.307 --> 01:00:16.602
- I thought it might
take my mind of things.

01:00:16.602 --> 01:00:17.313
- Did it?

01:00:18.313 --> 01:00:19.189
- No.

01:00:20.189 --> 01:00:22.858
- You feel like you were
doing something wrong?

01:00:22.858 --> 01:00:23.528
- Yes.

01:00:25.528 --> 01:00:27.195
- Why?

01:00:27.195 --> 01:00:29.740
- Because it just made
me think of Jeanie.

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:31.867
- Think what exactly.

01:00:31.867 --> 01:00:34.789
- That Carine
could never be her.

01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:39.126
- No one is replaceable, Bill.

01:00:40.126 --> 01:00:41.961
That doesn't mean
someone else can't play

01:00:41.961 --> 01:00:43.967
a special role in your life.

01:00:47.967 --> 01:00:50.887
Listen, we'll try
a new medication.

01:00:50.887 --> 01:00:52.555
And an augmenter
on top of it but

01:00:52.555 --> 01:00:57.059
I'm worried one of the
things holding you back

01:00:57.059 --> 01:00:59.436
is your own belief
that feeling better

01:00:59.436 --> 01:01:02.356
would be a betrayal of Jeanie.

01:01:02.356 --> 01:01:05.610
- I don't think that's the case.

01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:08.863
- The larger point I'm
trying to make here is that

01:01:08.863 --> 01:01:10.952
to have a chance
at feeling better

01:01:14.952 --> 01:01:17.885
you have to want to feel better.

01:01:30.885 --> 01:01:31.137
- Dad?

01:01:48.653 --> 01:01:48.947
Dad?

01:01:52.907 --> 01:01:54.452
- You okay?

01:01:56.452 --> 01:01:57.747
- I'm fine.

01:02:00.747 --> 01:02:01.376
- You sure?

01:02:03.376 --> 01:02:04.209
It's pretty late.

01:02:04.209 --> 01:02:06.256
- I said I'm fine, Wes.

01:02:14.012 --> 01:02:16.765
I just need a little air.

01:02:18.765 --> 01:02:20.394
I'll come in soon.

01:02:21.394 --> 01:02:21.979
- Okay.

01:03:19.702 --> 01:03:22.037
- Do you have
any idea how you sound?

01:03:22.037 --> 01:03:24.499
God forbid you spend
one single moment

01:03:24.499 --> 01:03:27.209
thinking about
anybody but yourself!

01:03:27.209 --> 01:03:27.919
- Exactly what
I'm talking about.

01:03:28.919 --> 01:03:30.505
It's just because
I don't believe

01:03:30.505 --> 01:03:32.881
that my life has to
be a living hell.

01:03:32.881 --> 01:03:34.508
That's make me wrong.

01:03:34.508 --> 01:03:36.218
- Sometimes
you have to be an adult.

01:03:44.142 --> 01:03:48.231
- Hey we just picked
up a shit ton of beer.

01:03:48.231 --> 01:03:49.070
What do you say?

01:04:00.285 --> 01:04:01.410
Didn't I tell you?

01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:03.622
The girl can drink.

01:04:04.622 --> 01:04:06.749
- Give me another.

01:04:07.749 --> 01:04:11.253
- There we go, yes,
there we go, drink up.

01:04:11.253 --> 01:04:12.963
She's outdrinking you, Rios.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:21.972
- Come on Rios.

01:04:21.972 --> 01:04:24.767
- Come on, juice
box, what's this?

01:04:29.771 --> 01:04:31.735
- Come on, man, let's go.

01:04:33.735 --> 01:04:36.695
- Rios, bring him back here.

01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:01.014
- Hi, it's Lacy.

01:05:03.014 --> 01:05:05.182
I don't understand
what I'm doing.

01:05:11.521 --> 01:05:14.150
- You're a smart wonderful girl.

01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:16.318
Just because people around
you want to hurt each other

01:05:16.318 --> 01:05:20.490
doesn't mean you should
do the same to yourself.

01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:23.166
You understand that, don't you?

01:05:31.166 --> 01:05:34.003
- Hey man I'm just
trying to understand

01:05:34.003 --> 01:05:36.130
whether or not you're with her.

01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:39.092
- I promised I
wouldn't talk about it.

01:05:39.092 --> 01:05:42.010
- So that means
there's most certainly

01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:44.807
something to talk about?

01:05:45.807 --> 01:05:47.849
See that right there.

01:05:47.849 --> 01:05:48.851
I knew it.

01:05:48.851 --> 01:05:51.604
How often do you
get to see this?

01:05:51.604 --> 01:05:52.276
True happiness.

01:05:56.276 --> 01:05:58.653
Don't you think that's great?

01:05:58.653 --> 01:05:59.363
- Yeah.

01:06:01.363 --> 01:06:02.198
- What?

01:06:03.198 --> 01:06:05.742
- Nothing. I agree it's cool.

01:06:05.742 --> 01:06:06.827
- That was great.

01:06:06.827 --> 01:06:08.704
- Yeah who we
picking up next time?

01:06:08.704 --> 01:06:12.508
- Whoever Mason
wants, right Mase?

01:06:20.508 --> 01:06:21.843
- Hey.

01:06:22.843 --> 01:06:25.179
- I'm not doing the
homework thing anymore.

01:06:25.179 --> 01:06:26.555
- Wait, why?

01:06:26.555 --> 01:06:28.724
- I don't know, Lacy,
why don't you ask Mason?

01:06:35.523 --> 01:06:35.900
- Wes, wait.

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:38.191
Look, I don't know
what you heard but--

01:06:38.191 --> 01:06:39.026
- Yeah, I heard enough.

01:06:39.026 --> 01:06:40.320
- Hey, well, I'm sure
that was bullshit.

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.486
- Yeah, right.

01:06:41.486 --> 01:06:42.322
- Don't laugh at me.

01:06:42.322 --> 01:06:43.740
- How can I not?

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:44.782
At first you tell
me you're afraid

01:06:44.782 --> 01:06:46.700
I'll talk about us and
then what do you do?

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.494
You go out with the one
guy who's guaranteed

01:06:48.494 --> 01:06:50.162
to tell the whole
God damn school.

01:06:50.162 --> 01:06:51.622
- We didn't go out,
it wasn't like that.

01:06:51.622 --> 01:06:53.206
- Then what was it?

01:06:53.206 --> 01:06:55.376
- It was just an excuse
to get drunk and--

01:06:55.376 --> 01:06:56.251
- And what?

01:06:56.251 --> 01:06:57.921
- And I don't know,
it was just stupid.

01:06:58.921 --> 01:07:00.256
- Stupid high school bullshit?

01:07:00.256 --> 01:07:01.715
- Yeah.

01:07:01.715 --> 01:07:05.218
- Like you wouldn't do with
me but you will that jackass.

01:07:05.218 --> 01:07:05.930
Who do you do all
this for anyway?

01:07:06.930 --> 01:07:07.972
- Do what?

01:07:07.972 --> 01:07:10.432
- What you do with Mason,
what you do to yourself

01:07:10.432 --> 01:07:12.769
'cause it sure as hell
isn't doing you any good.

01:07:12.769 --> 01:07:14.604
So who's it for huh?

01:07:14.604 --> 01:07:15.854
Is it for your parents?

01:07:15.854 --> 01:07:16.814
'Cause I'm pretty
sure they're too busy

01:07:16.814 --> 01:07:18.941
hating each other
to give a shit.

01:07:18.941 --> 01:07:19.943
- Well, I'm sorry
I can't be like you

01:07:19.943 --> 01:07:22.278
and just pretend like
nothing bothers me.

01:07:22.278 --> 01:07:23.780
I guess I'm just one of
those unfortunate people

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:25.240
who's actually affected by life.

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.700
- Okay, for your
information I am affected.

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:29.160
The only difference
is I don't think

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.702
the answer is cutting
myself to pieces

01:07:30.702 --> 01:07:32.579
or being Mason Bank's first call

01:07:32.579 --> 01:07:34.456
when he's looking for an
easy piece of late night ass.

01:07:39.921 --> 01:07:42.798
- Look, I may be
incredibly messed up,

01:07:42.798 --> 01:07:46.427
and I may do some
incredibly stupid things,

01:07:46.427 --> 01:07:47.845
but at least I'm not
a self righteous prick

01:07:47.845 --> 01:07:48.805
who goes around pretending like

01:07:48.805 --> 01:07:51.358
he's God's perfect little gift.

01:08:01.358 --> 01:08:03.528
- Good luck in French.

01:09:06.715 --> 01:09:08.843
- Good job today, fellas.

01:09:08.843 --> 01:09:10.513
- Thanks, coach.

01:09:12.513 --> 01:09:13.144
- Hold up, Wes.

01:09:19.144 --> 01:09:21.566
You want to do better don't you?

01:09:23.566 --> 01:09:24.984
- Doesn't matter.

01:09:25.984 --> 01:09:29.531
- It only matters if
it matters to you.

01:09:31.531 --> 01:09:34.743
Look, I'm not exactly
the Vince Lombardi

01:09:34.743 --> 01:09:38.041
of running coaches but
I could tell you this.

01:09:41.041 --> 01:09:43.170
Cross country is all about pain.

01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:49.968
Not denying or it pretending
it doesn't exist but

01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:53.054
recognizing it for
exactly what it is

01:09:54.054 --> 01:09:57.188
and then finding a way
to push through it.

01:10:03.188 --> 01:10:05.244
- Thanks, Mr. Abernac.

01:10:16.244 --> 01:10:17.454
- Bill?

01:10:18.454 --> 01:10:19.455
Hi.

01:10:19.455 --> 01:10:20.290
- Hi.

01:10:20.290 --> 01:10:22.125
- I wanted to thank you again
for inviting me to your party.

01:10:22.125 --> 01:10:24.085
I had a very nice time.

01:10:24.085 --> 01:10:24.920
- Good.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.756
- There's a free concert on
Saturday at McGiffen Park.

01:10:29.756 --> 01:10:32.929
Chopin, Verlouse,
perhaps you'd like to go?

01:10:34.929 --> 01:10:38.515
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:10:38.515 --> 01:10:40.977
- You mean the concert or?

01:10:40.977 --> 01:10:42.896
- No, I mean

01:10:43.896 --> 01:10:45.647
you and I spending
more time together.

01:10:45.647 --> 01:10:48.995
I don't think that's a good
idea for either one of us.

01:10:58.995 --> 01:11:01.580
- I'm sorry if I pushed you.

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:02.790
- You didn't.

01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:06.585
- I did and I should
have known better.

01:11:06.585 --> 01:11:10.548
Saturday, it doesn't
have to be a date.

01:11:10.548 --> 01:11:11.506
I mean
- Carine, please.

01:11:11.506 --> 01:11:12.634
- We can listen to music and--

01:11:12.634 --> 01:11:14.134
- Please.

01:11:14.134 --> 01:11:17.388
You're a lovely wonderful woman.

01:11:17.388 --> 01:11:20.474
Any man would be
crazy not to see that.

01:11:20.474 --> 01:11:22.398
But I just, I can't do this.

01:11:28.398 --> 01:11:31.487
I need you to understand that.

01:11:32.487 --> 01:11:33.870
- Yes ,I do.

01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:45.006
- If Y is equal to
the sine of Pi X then,

01:11:53.006 --> 01:11:56.807
then we take the integral
from negative two.

01:12:00.807 --> 01:12:04.064
No positive two to the
endpoint of five over two.

01:12:09.064 --> 01:12:10.067
Then we have the,

01:12:12.067 --> 01:12:14.947
no okay there
should be a DX here.

01:12:19.741 --> 01:12:22.662
But that's not,
that's not right.

01:12:23.662 --> 01:12:27.085
Okay, a definite integral from
positive two to the end...

01:12:29.085 --> 01:12:33.589
Yes you still have to
square it, don't you, Bill?

01:12:41.054 --> 01:12:41.932
- Yo, Mr. Palet, you alright?

01:12:42.932 --> 01:12:46.102
- Yeah, I just,
just need a minute.

01:13:11.878 --> 01:13:12.711
- In the old days
they would have

01:13:12.711 --> 01:13:15.339
called it a nervous breakdown.

01:13:15.339 --> 01:13:17.759
- I thought he was
getting better.

01:13:17.759 --> 01:13:19.134
- Unfortunately
it's not uncommon

01:13:19.134 --> 01:13:22.054
for an upswing to
proceed a downturn.

01:13:22.054 --> 01:13:24.389
The thing is Bill's
connection with Jeanie

01:13:24.389 --> 01:13:28.061
was so profound that
his grief is extreme.

01:13:28.061 --> 01:13:32.439
So much so that the emotional
is now becoming physical.

01:13:32.439 --> 01:13:34.525
- Which means what?

01:13:34.525 --> 01:13:38.321
- That if we don't find
a way to turn this around

01:13:38.321 --> 01:13:41.536
as bad as it is now,
it can get worse.

01:13:55.671 --> 01:13:56.008
- You okay?

01:13:59.008 --> 01:13:59.843
- Yeah.

01:14:00.843 --> 01:14:05.473
- As long as your dad is here
I want you to stay with us.

01:14:06.473 --> 01:14:07.394
- I'll be fine.

01:14:10.394 --> 01:14:13.272
- Look Wes, we all
could use somebody

01:14:13.272 --> 01:14:15.023
to lean on from time to time.

01:14:15.023 --> 01:14:18.027
- I really appreciate that,
Mr. Abernac, but

01:14:19.027 --> 01:14:20.571
leaning on people
really hasn't worked out

01:14:20.571 --> 01:14:23.616
all that well for me so far so

01:14:23.616 --> 01:14:26.793
just not gonna do it anymore.

01:14:33.793 --> 01:14:36.713
- So we can continue
trying new medications

01:14:36.713 --> 01:14:39.424
but clearly we need to do more.

01:14:39.424 --> 01:14:42.802
I want to see you in my
office three times a week.

01:14:42.802 --> 01:14:44.970
And I'm going to
insist that you start

01:14:44.970 --> 01:14:48.348
going to one of those support
groups that we talked about.

01:14:48.348 --> 01:14:50.768
I also think that
we should discuss

01:14:50.768 --> 01:14:53.312
electroconvulsive therapy.

01:14:53.312 --> 01:14:55.482
Now that may sound extreme.

01:14:56.482 --> 01:14:58.317
But the fact is it's
a far more refined

01:14:58.317 --> 01:14:59.818
treatment than it used to be.

01:14:59.818 --> 01:15:01.571
Its very safe.

01:15:01.571 --> 01:15:03.238
And it's proven to
be highly affective

01:15:03.238 --> 01:15:05.241
in treating sever
depression that's

01:15:05.241 --> 01:15:08.162
unresponsive to other
forms of treatment.

01:15:10.162 --> 01:15:13.790
Given the severity of the
break you just experienced

01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:17.210
I believe it would be a mistake
for us not to consider it.

01:15:24.259 --> 01:15:25.720
- Mr. Palet?

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:29.890
Mr. Palet are you still with us?

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:29.933
There you are.

01:15:30.933 --> 01:15:34.771
So I'm going to give
you a muscle relaxant

01:15:34.771 --> 01:15:38.523
All you have to do is
relax and take a nice nap.

01:15:38.523 --> 01:15:40.610
How does that sound?

01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:42.277
- Okay.

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:34.832
- He relished the
moments and I know that

01:16:36.832 --> 01:16:38.588
I'm ever thankful to God

01:16:41.588 --> 01:16:44.552
that I had the
opportunity to spend

01:16:47.552 --> 01:16:51.433
the best part of my
life with this person.

01:16:53.433 --> 01:16:55.393
It's just not the same.

01:17:33.723 --> 01:17:36.558
- Mr. Rios, I think you
will find it difficult

01:17:36.558 --> 01:17:40.791
to pass the final if
I kick you out of it.

01:18:00.791 --> 01:18:00.920
Wes?

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.589
How's your father?

01:18:06.589 --> 01:18:07.008
- He's fine.

01:18:09.008 --> 01:18:13.224
- If there's anything I can
do I hope you'll let me know.

01:18:17.224 --> 01:18:19.059
- Don't be last.

01:18:19.059 --> 01:18:22.731
Okay, let's finish
hard, let finish hard.

01:18:25.817 --> 01:18:27.780
Alright, bring it in.

01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:33.909
Alright, for those of you
hoping to qualify for SPC

01:18:34.909 --> 01:18:38.580
the trinity quads will be
your final opportunity.

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:40.122
It's also a race
in which we have

01:18:40.122 --> 01:18:43.543
yet to place higher than fourth.

01:18:43.543 --> 01:18:45.628
It's a rather uncomfortable fact

01:18:45.628 --> 01:18:48.464
given that only four
schools participate.

01:18:48.464 --> 01:18:51.467
So please if you bear
me any good will at all

01:18:51.467 --> 01:18:55.263
make sure that you eat a
large carbohydrate filled meal

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:58.308
and that you're not
late for the bus.

01:18:58.308 --> 01:18:59.349
Martinez.

01:18:59.349 --> 01:19:00.309
- Yeah, coach.

01:19:00.309 --> 01:19:02.479
- Okay, that's it.

01:19:04.479 --> 01:19:08.777
- Hey Wes, is it true your
dad is not coming back?

01:19:09.777 --> 01:19:11.862
Dude, that's what
Bobelchek said.

01:19:11.862 --> 01:19:14.031
- Bobelchek's a
brain dead moron.

01:19:14.031 --> 01:19:18.119
- Yeah but, your dad
he's gonna be okay, right?

01:19:18.119 --> 01:19:19.661
- Yeah, of course.

01:19:19.661 --> 01:19:21.580
He so depressed he had
to be hospitalized.

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:22.956
They're done finding a
medication that can help

01:19:22.956 --> 01:19:24.000
so they're just
shooting electricity

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.376
straight through his
brain, but yeah, Goob.

01:19:26.376 --> 01:19:27.210
I'm sure everything's
gonna be just

01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:29.340
hunky dory from here on out.

01:19:51.527 --> 01:19:53.116
So, how's the group going?

01:19:57.116 --> 01:19:58.536
- Good.

01:20:01.536 --> 01:20:03.250
- What do you talk about?

01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:08.964
- Things people
have been through.

01:20:10.964 --> 01:20:12.553
- What about the ECT?

01:20:17.553 --> 01:20:19.223
You think it's helping?

01:20:21.223 --> 01:20:22.893
- I'm not sure.

01:20:24.893 --> 01:20:26.063
- Feel any different?

01:20:28.063 --> 01:20:29.692
- Not really.

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:34.085
Dr. Rollins says it
doesn't work for everybody.

01:20:49.085 --> 01:20:51.924
- Why don't you just
get it over with then?

01:20:54.924 --> 01:20:55.303
- Get what?

01:20:58.303 --> 01:20:58.973
- Dying.

01:21:02.973 --> 01:21:06.439
That's what you're
really doing right?

01:21:10.439 --> 01:21:12.608
I know you're depressed.

01:21:12.608 --> 01:21:15.111
And I know that I'm
supposed to be supportive.

01:21:15.111 --> 01:21:16.278
- I'm not asking
you to do anything.

01:21:16.278 --> 01:21:17.572
- Yes you are.

01:21:18.572 --> 01:21:21.492
You're asking me
to just accept it.

01:21:22.492 --> 01:21:26.290
Just sit back, just watch
you die just like Mom.

01:21:28.290 --> 01:21:29.709
- I know this has been hard.

01:21:29.709 --> 01:21:31.128
- Yeah, you think?

01:21:32.128 --> 01:21:36.799
I mean first my mom dies and
then we just pack up and leave

01:21:36.799 --> 01:21:39.469
out of the blue out of nowhere.

01:21:39.469 --> 01:21:41.888
- Wes you're mom and I--

01:21:41.888 --> 01:21:43.807
- Were everything.

01:21:44.807 --> 01:21:45.726
Okay, I know.

01:21:46.726 --> 01:21:47.643
I get it.

01:21:47.643 --> 01:21:51.358
But do you honestly think that
this is what she would want?

01:21:54.358 --> 01:21:54.946
Mom was amazing.

01:21:57.946 --> 01:21:59.696
You think I don't miss her every

01:21:59.696 --> 01:22:02.535
single second of
every single day?

01:22:04.535 --> 01:22:06.662
But here's the headline, Dad.

01:22:06.662 --> 01:22:10.085
She's gone forever and
she's never ever coming back.

01:22:13.085 --> 01:22:14.170
- Wesley, I am so sorry.

01:22:14.170 --> 01:22:15.796
- I don't want sorry!

01:22:18.674 --> 01:22:20.260
I want my dad back.

01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:22.344
- I'm here.

01:22:22.344 --> 01:22:23.513
- No, you're not.

01:22:24.513 --> 01:22:27.186
And you haven't been
for a long time.

01:22:30.186 --> 01:22:33.188
If I'm gonna have to spend
the rest of my life alone

01:22:33.188 --> 01:22:35.607
tell me now 'cause
if you're just gonna

01:22:35.607 --> 01:22:38.027
give up and die than
maybe I should too.

01:22:38.027 --> 01:22:39.027
- Wes, please don't say that.

01:22:39.027 --> 01:22:40.115
- I'm serious!

01:22:42.115 --> 01:22:45.410
That's what this
is all about, right?

01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:47.912
If there's a point to
all this, the living?

01:22:48.912 --> 01:22:52.210
I mean whether it's
worth it to even try.

01:22:54.210 --> 01:22:56.254
Well, make up your
God damn mind, Dad.

01:22:56.254 --> 01:22:58.464
If the answer is no why
don't you just fucking

01:22:58.464 --> 01:22:59.464
kill yourself and
get it over with?

01:23:50.642 --> 01:23:52.478
- Runners set.

01:27:24.647 --> 01:27:25.481
- This is Michael.

01:27:25.481 --> 01:27:27.191
- Hello Michael,
it's Bill Palet.

01:27:27.191 --> 01:27:29.235
- Bill.
What a surprise.

01:27:29.235 --> 01:27:30.486
How are you?

01:27:30.486 --> 01:27:32.071
- I'm okay, how are you?

01:27:32.071 --> 01:27:34.365
- Doing well,
doing well, thanks.

01:27:34.365 --> 01:27:35.535
- Good good.

01:27:37.535 --> 01:27:43.499
Listen, I'm calling
because I know

01:27:43.499 --> 01:27:46.628
you were always a real
supporter of Jeanie's work.

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:47.545
- Oh yeah.

01:27:47.545 --> 01:27:50.214
- And I wonder if the museum
would like to have it.

01:27:50.214 --> 01:27:51.590
- Well,
we'd be delighted.

01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:54.719
Any specific pieces
you had in mind?

01:27:54.719 --> 01:27:56.888
- All of it, everything.

01:27:57.888 --> 01:27:59.848
- I'm sorry,
did you say all of it?

01:27:59.848 --> 01:28:00.683
- Yeah.

01:28:01.683 --> 01:28:03.811
- Bill?

01:28:03.811 --> 01:28:05.604
- I know you'll take
good care of it.

01:28:05.604 --> 01:28:06.522
- Of course.

01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:40.723
- That's it, you did it,
you did it, kid.

01:28:40.723 --> 01:28:44.727
That was just God
damned extraordinary.

01:28:44.727 --> 01:28:47.104
I'm telling you, that was just

01:28:47.104 --> 01:28:50.858
absolutely God
damned extraordinary.

01:28:51.858 --> 01:28:53.236
Did you guys see that?

01:28:53.236 --> 01:28:56.406
That was incredible, incredible.

01:29:17.427 --> 01:29:19.598
- Dad, Dad, I'm sorry.

01:29:21.598 --> 01:29:22.890
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:29:23.890 --> 01:29:25.268
I didn't mean what I said.

01:29:25.268 --> 01:29:26.643
- I know.

01:29:26.643 --> 01:29:27.437
I know.

01:29:27.437 --> 01:29:28.437
- I'd have never said it.

01:29:28.437 --> 01:29:31.448
- It's okay, you
had every right.

01:29:39.448 --> 01:29:41.120
Listen Wes, Wes, Wes, hey.

01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:45.122
I'm sorry.

01:29:47.122 --> 01:29:49.668
And I'm sorry I missed you race.

01:29:50.668 --> 01:29:53.888
And I'm not gonna miss any more.

01:30:01.888 --> 01:30:04.269
Congratulations, Son.

01:30:09.269 --> 01:30:11.022
- Look at that.

01:30:12.022 --> 01:30:13.360
- Can you believe it?

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:16.321
- Yeah, sure.

01:30:19.321 --> 01:30:22.464
You Wes, are a
bright shining star.

01:30:45.264 --> 01:30:47.976
- She passed the French final.

01:30:47.976 --> 01:30:49.686
- Glad to hear it.

01:30:49.686 --> 01:30:53.741
- But she's still in
kind of a bad mood.

01:31:04.741 --> 01:31:07.036
- Looks so official.

01:31:07.036 --> 01:31:08.499
- I know, right?

01:31:11.499 --> 01:31:13.543
- So are you like a jock now?

01:31:13.543 --> 01:31:14.170
- Yeah.

01:31:16.170 --> 01:31:19.883
Figured it was time
to kind of rebrand.

01:31:20.883 --> 01:31:21.927
- Yeah, I mean, you did
take awkward new kid

01:31:22.927 --> 01:31:25.554
about as far as you could.

01:31:25.554 --> 01:31:29.224
- And plus you had brooding
loather locked up so

01:31:29.224 --> 01:31:31.729
that was never really an option.

01:31:33.729 --> 01:31:35.814
Heard you passed French.

01:31:35.814 --> 01:31:39.652
- Yeah, just kept hearing your
dorky voice in my head going...

01:31:57.420 --> 01:31:59.425
Can we please try this again?

01:32:03.425 --> 01:32:06.014
- You promise me
something first?

01:32:09.014 --> 01:32:10.727
No more Mason.

01:32:12.727 --> 01:32:16.195
- Thought it was gonna
be something difficult.

01:32:22.195 --> 01:32:24.032
- No more hurting yourself.

01:32:27.032 --> 01:32:31.121
- Yeah Carine's been trying
to get me to see some doctor.

01:32:33.121 --> 01:32:35.804
- Promise me you'll go.

01:32:47.804 --> 01:32:49.097
That was okay?

01:32:49.097 --> 01:32:50.138
Too fast for you?

01:32:50.138 --> 01:32:50.973
- Shut up.

01:32:50.973 --> 01:32:50.973
- No, I'm just making sure
'cause

01:32:51.808 --> 01:32:52.849
I don't want to rush
into things, okay.

01:32:52.849 --> 01:32:55.729
- Shut up or I'm
keeping your medal.

01:32:57.729 --> 01:32:59.773
- I was gonna give
it to you anyway.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.161
- Hey, welcome
back, Mr. Palet.

01:33:13.161 --> 01:33:14.540
- Thanks.

01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:18.339
- Let's here it for Mr. P.

01:33:23.339 --> 01:33:23.969
- Carine.

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:28.554
- Hello.

01:33:30.554 --> 01:33:31.848
- Hi.

01:33:31.848 --> 01:33:34.102
I was hoping I
would find you here.

01:33:36.102 --> 01:33:37.187
- Well, you did.

01:33:39.187 --> 01:33:40.650
- Yes.

01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:44.943
Do you like ice cream?

01:33:44.943 --> 01:33:47.196
I know that's maybe the
dumbest question I've ever,

01:33:47.196 --> 01:33:49.532
anyone has ever asked anyone.

01:33:50.532 --> 01:33:52.619
Who doesn't like
ice cream, right?

01:33:52.619 --> 01:33:53.452
- Not me.

01:33:53.452 --> 01:33:53.955
- Right.

01:33:55.955 --> 01:33:57.581
Meaning that you do like it?

01:33:57.581 --> 01:33:58.791
- Yeah, I do.

01:33:59.791 --> 01:34:04.464
- Good because we were just
about to go get some and

01:34:04.464 --> 01:34:07.884
I was hoping you'd
like to join us.

01:34:07.884 --> 01:34:09.384
- Who is us?

01:34:09.384 --> 01:34:12.055
- Oh I have Wes
and Lacy with me.

01:34:13.055 --> 01:34:15.558
You know, I figured if
you came along it'd be

01:34:15.558 --> 01:34:19.357
a little less of that awkward
chaperoney kind of vibe.

01:34:22.357 --> 01:34:26.736
- Is that the only reason
you are asking me to come?

01:34:26.736 --> 01:34:28.116
- No, it's not.

01:34:32.116 --> 01:34:33.660
I'm asking you because
I would really like

01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:36.456
to spend some time with you.
