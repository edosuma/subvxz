00:01.333 --> 00:02.583
<i>You guys here to sign me?</i>

00:02.634 --> 00:03.784
Depends on what you're
looking for in an Agent.

00:03.836 --> 00:05.570
Whoever gets me the most money
up front.

00:05.637 --> 00:07.805
Highest signing bonus wins.

00:07.890 --> 00:09.640
I'm one curve ball away
from blowing out my arm

00:09.758 --> 00:10.925
and being washed up
like you two.

00:10.976 --> 00:12.626
So I'll take mine now --

00:12.678 --> 00:15.629
the money, all of it.

00:15.681 --> 00:17.231
Wow.

00:17.299 --> 00:19.150
Millicent Huxtable,
field reporter.

00:19.234 --> 00:21.602
I'd watch you
all day long.

00:21.653 --> 00:22.854
This job should be yours,
Marvin.

00:22.938 --> 00:24.272
You're great at what you do,

00:24.323 --> 00:25.990
and I'm just some silly girl
pretending to be a reporter.

00:27.860 --> 00:28.860

No, stop!

00:41.173 --> 00:42.507
Stop! Stop!

00:42.591 --> 00:44.125
Julian!

00:47.262 --> 00:49.663
I just want two people
who are gonna love this baby,

00:49.715 --> 00:52.383
who can take care

02:00.586 --> 02:02.920
Yes, we're gonna make it work.

02:03.005 --> 02:04.255

02:06.908 --> 02:08.092
Quinn, this is not
gonna work

02:08.176 --> 02:09.426

02:09.511 --> 02:10.578
There is no backseat!

02:10.628 --> 02:11.912

02:13.549 --> 02:16.083
We got this.
You're good.

02:16.134 --> 02:17.385
Quinny, I can't.

02:17.436 --> 02:19.787
You have to,
'cause you're having the baby!

02:19.855 --> 02:21.222

02:47.332 --> 02:49.800

Yes, I'm getting a baby

Well, blue or pink,

to know the sex ahead of time...

04:01.290 --> 04:02.657
- Yellow.
- ...Green.

04:02.708 --> 04:04.992

though.

04:05.043 --> 04:09.297

but don't sleep
on enchanted forest.

04:16.053 --> 04:20.374
It is enchanted.
We're gonna have a family.

04:20.425 --> 04:22.893
We're gonna have a baby
in a room

04:22.978 --> 04:26.564
with paint called enchanted
forest or soft duckling.

04:28.684 --> 04:30.818
You're
my enchanted forest.

04:30.885 --> 04:32.903
You're my soft duckling.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.108
Mmm.

04:37.175 --> 04:40.695
Aw, look
at my soft duckling.

04:40.746 --> 04:42.863
I'm supposed to be
a chicken.

04:42.914 --> 04:45.333
A chicken.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.585
- Isn't that how the last guy --
- Yes!

04:47.669 --> 04:50.921
Yes, that's how the last guy
got run down in traffic.

04:52.207 --> 04:53.507
I don't want
to cross the road.

04:53.575 --> 04:55.710
Well, why don't you do one
of the other stories, then?

04:55.761 --> 04:57.878
Because they're boring,
and I want to make a splash.

04:57.929 --> 04:59.880
Chicken suit
makes a splash.

04:59.931 --> 05:02.183
Chicken suit makes
a splatter, too.

05:02.250 --> 05:03.184
I know.

05:03.251 --> 05:05.436
Okay.

05:05.520 --> 05:08.022
Well, how about you read me
one of the other stories,

05:08.089 --> 05:09.607
and we can come up
with an angle?

05:09.691 --> 05:10.691
You'll help me?

05:10.759 --> 05:12.026
Of course.

05:12.093 --> 05:14.395
Anything for my...
Hot chick.

05:14.446 --> 05:15.730
Nice.

05:15.781 --> 05:17.148
I am hot.

05:17.232 --> 05:19.867
My chicken feet are sweating
like you wouldn't believe.

05:22.788 --> 05:23.904
Ew.

05:33.832 --> 05:35.332
You wanted to see me?

05:37.118 --> 05:40.171
Were you surprised
by your "A," Mr. Scott?

05:40.288 --> 05:43.290
A-minus. Were you?

05:43.341 --> 05:45.843
I believe they invented
the word "very"

05:45.927 --> 05:47.428
for moments such as these.

05:48.930 --> 05:50.765
I will take that

05:50.816 --> 05:53.267
as a Dan Scott-like pat
on the back, Professor.

05:55.570 --> 05:58.689
I don't want you
representing my son.

05:58.774 --> 06:01.859
I'd appreciate it
if you would stop.

06:04.446 --> 06:06.947
Is that why I got an "A"?

06:06.998 --> 06:09.850
A-minus. And no.

06:09.918 --> 06:12.169
Your representation of Ian,
or lack thereof,

06:12.254 --> 06:14.422
will not affect your grade
for this course.

06:14.489 --> 06:18.092
Well, good, because Ian
is a hell of a prospect,

06:18.159 --> 06:19.593
and he's gonna need
an Agent.

06:19.661 --> 06:22.379
I didn't say I don't want him
represented, Mr. Scott.

06:22.464 --> 06:24.565
I simply don't want him

07:11.979 --> 07:13.979
He's just so smug about it,
you know.

07:14.091 --> 07:16.492
Like I'm not good enough
to represent his son.

07:16.543 --> 07:18.878
And then he started
into the whole

07:18.962 --> 07:21.497
separation-of-business-
and-personal nonsense.

07:21.548 --> 07:23.282
Mm.

And then that chick
from Kellerman's boat came by.

07:26.002 --> 07:27.303
She asked about you.

07:27.354 --> 07:29.639
Who, Tracy?

07:29.690 --> 07:31.107
So not as hot as Quinn.

07:31.174 --> 07:32.692
So, what do you think?

07:32.776 --> 07:35.611
I'm thinking pancakes or fajitas.
Never mind.

07:35.679 --> 07:38.314
And, really,
pancakes or fajitas?

07:38.365 --> 07:40.066
How are those
your choices?

07:40.150 --> 07:42.568
Mm, because, Nate, I like
pancakes, and I like fajitas.

07:42.653 --> 07:45.121
That's like saying
applesauce or mashed potatoes.

07:45.188 --> 07:47.623
Ooh, mashed potatoes
sound great.

07:47.691 --> 07:49.242
You're very strange.
You know that?

07:49.326 --> 07:50.576
Mm-hmm.
Totally weird.

07:51.695 --> 07:54.714
Hey, oh. Julian.

07:54.798 --> 07:56.999
What's up, J-man?

07:57.050 --> 07:59.085
Yeah, I'm aware
it's not Jamie.

07:59.169 --> 08:01.504
What's going on?

08:01.555 --> 08:03.506
Hello?

08:03.557 --> 08:05.541
Hello?!

08:05.592 --> 08:07.927
You drop him?
Yep.

08:08.011 --> 08:09.512
I'll just text him back.

08:09.563 --> 08:11.347
You know, I can't remember
the last time

08:11.398 --> 08:12.932
that I actually completed
a call.

08:13.016 --> 08:15.434
Well, we've only had cellphones
for like 30 years.

08:15.519 --> 08:17.353
You can't expect miracles.

08:17.404 --> 08:20.156
Hey. Tea and tea.

08:20.223 --> 08:22.492
You know, one day,
we're gonna look back and say,

08:22.559 --> 08:24.226
"remember when we used
to drop calls,

08:24.278 --> 08:26.362
and we were all like,
'hello? Is anybody there?'"

08:26.413 --> 08:27.747
this is why we text.

08:27.831 --> 08:30.199
Why do people text?

08:30.250 --> 08:31.901
Because
calling people ends

08:31.952 --> 08:32.869
in frustration
and disappointment.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.236
No, people text

08:34.288 --> 08:35.755
because they don't like
to be put on the spot.

08:35.839 --> 08:36.923
Nobody wants to be caught

08:37.006 --> 08:38.591
on the other side
of that conversation

08:38.674 --> 08:40.760
when someone asks them
to carpool or lend them money,

08:40.844 --> 08:43.212
or when someone tells you
that they've always loved you.

08:43.263 --> 08:44.580
Trust me,
the last one's the worst.

08:44.631 --> 08:48.351
No, not as bad as when they call
and then they ask you

08:48.418 --> 08:50.203
to smuggle 15 balloons
of pure Bolivian cocaine

08:50.270 --> 08:52.138
across the Turkish border,

08:52.222 --> 08:54.974
and you got bills to pay,
and you got a problem saying no.

08:56.193 --> 08:57.092
You finished?

08:57.144 --> 08:58.477
In your butt.

08:59.780 --> 09:01.697
Now I'm finished.

09:01.765 --> 09:04.099
Nobody likes
to be put on the spot.

09:04.151 --> 09:06.319
They want to read it, think
about it, and then respond,

09:06.403 --> 09:08.287
usually with a well-conceived
lie or an excuse.

09:08.372 --> 09:10.823
Or they just pretend
they didn't even get it.

09:10.908 --> 09:13.042
Or when you text
that you love someone

09:13.109 --> 09:14.493
and you don't hear
anything back,

09:14.578 --> 09:16.212
you can pretend
that they never got it.

09:16.279 --> 09:18.164
You can't do that on the phone.

09:18.248 --> 09:20.299
I tell myself
they're dead

09:20.384 --> 09:22.952
or just being held in a pit
like in "Silence of the Lambs."

09:23.003 --> 09:26.288
It puts the lotion
in the basket.

09:26.340 --> 09:27.590
Actually, the line was,

09:27.641 --> 09:29.124
"it <i>places</i> the lotion
in the basket,"

09:29.176 --> 09:30.726
but everybody always
gets it wrong.

09:30.794 --> 09:33.846
Anyway, what about the pit
in "Silence of the Lambs"?

09:33.931 --> 09:35.631
Well, apparently you don't get good
cellphone coverage down there.

09:35.682 --> 09:36.883
Exactly.
Oh, well, yeah.

09:36.950 --> 09:39.485
We've only had cellphones
for the last 30 years,

09:39.570 --> 09:40.820
so you can't expect
a miracle.

09:40.888 --> 09:45.291
Anyway, clear your minds,
which is not hard, I know.

09:45.359 --> 09:46.525
You ready?
Mm-hmm.

09:46.593 --> 09:49.228
Soft duckling
or enchanted forest?

09:49.296 --> 09:50.580
Are you starting
a band?

09:50.647 --> 09:52.348
Because I would go see
soft duckling.

09:52.416 --> 09:53.666
No.

09:53.750 --> 09:56.619
These are the paint colors
for my baby's room.

09:56.687 --> 09:57.954
Ugh.
Mm.

09:58.005 --> 09:59.505
I got to go to work.
I'm --

09:59.590 --> 10:01.007
bar manager.
Bar manager. Bar manager.

10:01.091 --> 10:03.242
Hate is a choice.
Don't do it.

10:06.346 --> 10:08.297
Seriously,
yellow or green?

10:08.348 --> 10:11.217
I don't know, that's like
asking us to compare applesauce

10:11.301 --> 10:12.852
and mashed potatoes.

10:12.936 --> 10:15.888
Ooh, mashed potatoes. Nice call.
Sounds good, right?

10:15.973 --> 10:18.224
I'm so glad that my wife
is not having a son.

10:18.308 --> 10:20.309
I got to go find Ian.

10:20.360 --> 10:23.362
Text him! Don't call!

He told you not to be my Agent.

I got left back a year.

14:47.294 --> 14:48.911

You wanted to wear the suit,

I am. It's nice.
I feel chicken-y.

15:04.627 --> 15:06.228
Okay.

15:06.296 --> 15:09.098
Well, basically
they did a study

15:09.149 --> 15:12.101
saying that street signs
are more noticeable

15:12.152 --> 15:14.820
if only the first letter
is capitalized,

15:14.905 --> 15:16.088
not the whole name.

15:16.156 --> 15:18.857
They did not do that study.
Yes, they did.

15:18.942 --> 15:22.027
Someone actually paid
someone money for that?

15:22.112 --> 15:25.331
Mm-hmm, you did,
with your taxpayer dollars...

15:25.415 --> 15:28.450
I mean,
when you had a job.

15:28.501 --> 15:31.754
I have a job.
I'm a bartender.

15:31.821 --> 15:33.455
You're kind of more
of a bar back.

15:33.506 --> 15:35.174
Who bartends
once in a while.

15:35.258 --> 15:37.760
Okay, sorry.
Bartender.

15:37.827 --> 15:40.329
I pay my taxes.
I know you do, honey.

15:40.380 --> 15:44.266
You are a hard-working,
tax-paying,

15:44.334 --> 15:48.804
very handsome,
chicken-y-feeling bartender.

15:48.855 --> 15:50.773
I still need help
on the story.

15:50.840 --> 15:54.009
Okay, well, maybe you could do
something like, um,

15:54.060 --> 15:55.945
"why did the chicken
cross the wrong road?

15:56.012 --> 15:57.846
Because he couldn't read
the street signs."

15:57.897 --> 16:00.149
Hey, that's pretty good.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.201
So they really paid someone
for this study?

16:02.285 --> 16:03.535
Like, some firm somewhere,

16:03.620 --> 16:05.687
with supposedly educated people,
did this?

16:05.739 --> 16:07.823
Mm-hmm. They're changing
the signs, too.

16:07.874 --> 16:09.858
They say signs
with all capital letters

16:09.909 --> 16:11.944
cause people
to stare a little longer,

16:12.012 --> 16:13.629
and the lingering
causes accidents.

16:13.696 --> 16:15.130
The lingering?
Mm-hmm.

16:15.198 --> 16:18.000
The lingering on the
all-capital-letter street signs

16:18.051 --> 16:19.835
that we've had since
the beginning of time.

16:19.919 --> 16:21.003
Mm-hmm.

16:21.054 --> 16:21.920
Let me ask you
a question.

16:22.005 --> 16:23.138
Which are larger,

16:23.206 --> 16:24.673
capital letters
or smaller letters?

16:24.741 --> 16:26.008
Capital letters.

16:26.059 --> 16:27.042
And what's easier
to see,

16:27.093 --> 16:27.926
larger things
or small things?

16:28.011 --> 16:29.178
Larger.

16:29.229 --> 16:30.712
And what do you think
would cause one

16:30.764 --> 16:32.097
to linger
on a street sign,

16:32.182 --> 16:33.682
the fact that the larger,
easier-to-read letters

16:33.733 --> 16:34.433
tripped you up,

16:34.517 --> 16:35.601
or the fact that, hey,

16:35.685 --> 16:36.935
why are all the street signs
different?

16:37.020 --> 16:38.854
Bam. Accident.
Bam?

16:38.905 --> 16:41.940
Bam, not to mention the money
they spent on this study

16:42.025 --> 16:43.942
and the money they're gonna spend
to change all the street signs.

16:44.027 --> 16:46.912
$110 per sign
on every street sign in America.

16:46.997 --> 16:48.563
Unbelievable.

16:48.615 --> 16:51.367
Schools don't have art or music
or hot lunches or books,

16:51.418 --> 16:55.237
and this is where my tax dollars
as a bartender are going?

16:55.288 --> 16:57.572
Wow. You are really worked up
about this street-sign thing.

16:57.624 --> 16:58.740
I am.

16:58.792 --> 17:01.844
And kind of
the bartender thing, too.

17:01.911 --> 17:04.246
I guess I'll do it, then --
the story.

17:04.297 --> 17:06.915
Well, only do it if you'll say
how ridiculous it is,

17:06.965 --> 17:09.385
that it's a ridiculous, stupid,
wasteful project.

17:09.435 --> 17:11.520
I wish.

17:11.587 --> 17:13.521
Well, Jerry loves
stuff like that.

17:13.589 --> 17:16.692
You know? Just call it,
um, social commentary.

17:16.776 --> 17:18.426
I don't think so,
but thanks.

17:19.396 --> 17:21.280
You hot?

17:21.364 --> 17:22.698
Yeah, you're right.
My feet are sweating.

17:22.765 --> 17:23.932
Mm-hmm.

17:27.153 --> 17:29.621
You know, if a guy plays
most of his career

17:29.706 --> 17:30.989
in the minors, and then
he gets called up...

17:31.074 --> 17:32.491
You're a bartender.

17:32.575 --> 17:33.959
...He's a major-leaguer,
Millie.

17:34.044 --> 17:37.046
Bartender.
Bartender.

17:37.113 --> 17:38.447
That's right.

17:40.450 --> 17:43.001
Okay, here we go.
Brooke, I'm fine.

17:43.086 --> 17:45.287
I know. It's okay.
You just got a little spooked.

17:45.338 --> 17:46.588
I really do think it was

17:46.639 --> 17:48.790
more from standing up so fast
than anything.

17:48.842 --> 17:51.260
Well, you saved my keys,
and if you hadn't --

17:51.311 --> 17:52.811
You would've had to use
the spare key

17:52.896 --> 17:54.563
under the gnome statue.

17:54.630 --> 17:56.115
Hi.

17:56.182 --> 17:57.232
Hi.

17:57.300 --> 17:59.101
Chloe,
what are you doing here?

17:59.152 --> 18:01.770
Oh, I'm making
a toaster pastry.

18:01.821 --> 18:04.139
But how did you get in?

18:04.190 --> 18:06.641
I used the spare key
under the gnome statue.

18:06.693 --> 18:07.826
You want one?

18:07.911 --> 18:10.279
Yes, but what are you
doing here,

18:10.330 --> 18:13.282
other than making
delicious toaster strudel?

18:13.333 --> 18:14.883
I mean, are you okay?

18:14.951 --> 18:17.369
There's been a change
of plans.

18:21.591 --> 18:24.209
I had a checkup this morning,
and, um...

18:27.380 --> 18:30.432
...looks like your baby's gonna
be here sooner than we thought.

18:32.268 --> 18:33.469
Oh.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.670
Oh.

18:42.111 --> 18:44.162
So, tell me again
how it went down.

18:44.247 --> 18:46.048
I got an a-minus,
he asked to see me,

18:46.115 --> 18:48.550
and then he told me he didn't
want us representing Ian.

18:48.617 --> 18:50.168
You believe that?

18:50.236 --> 18:51.503
Everything except
the a-minus part.

18:53.806 --> 18:56.475
So, what do you think?

18:56.559 --> 18:58.009
Well, I think
Kellerman's a bully,

18:58.094 --> 18:59.811
and we need
to get Ian a great deal

18:59.896 --> 19:01.930
so he can get out from under
his father and never look back.

19:01.981 --> 19:03.932
And are we talking about
Ian Kellerman now

19:03.983 --> 19:06.134
or Nathan Scott?

19:06.185 --> 19:08.070
I know you don't like Ian.

19:08.137 --> 19:10.155
And on the surface,
there's not a lot to like.

19:10.239 --> 19:12.908
But I've been there, clay.

19:12.975 --> 19:15.193
He just needs to grow up
and find some stability.

19:17.146 --> 19:19.865
You see the past
when you look at this kid.

19:19.949 --> 19:21.450
I get that.

19:21.501 --> 19:23.085
But, buddy,
I don't trust him.

19:23.152 --> 19:26.872
So we beat Kellerman at his own
game, with his own words.

19:26.956 --> 19:28.156
Trust is a gamble.
Get it in writing.

19:28.207 --> 19:30.175
We have Ian sign
a contract with us.

19:30.259 --> 19:32.461
That way Kellerman can't
influence him or pressure him.

19:32.512 --> 19:34.963
And then we include
a morals clause

19:35.014 --> 19:37.499
in case you're right
and I'm wrong, which I'm not.

19:37.550 --> 19:39.434
So you beat Kellerman
using his own textbook.

19:39.502 --> 19:41.186
Nice going, a-minus.

19:42.271 --> 19:46.141
Nathan! It's time!

19:47.894 --> 19:50.845
Yeah. Okay. We're just gonna
finish this game.

19:50.897 --> 19:52.447
The baby's coming
right now.

19:52.515 --> 19:53.982
Yeah, I know.

19:54.050 --> 19:55.283
Clay?

19:55.351 --> 19:56.902
This is
really exciting stuff, Hales,

19:56.986 --> 19:58.787
but if you could
just force your knees together

19:58.854 --> 20:00.205
and hang in there,
we're almost done.

20:00.289 --> 20:01.373
In fact,
do you want winners?

20:01.457 --> 20:02.908
I don't think
you guys understand.

20:02.992 --> 20:05.293
I'm gonna have the baby
right here.

20:05.361 --> 20:07.629
Yeah, I don't think you understand.
Mnh-mnh.

20:07.696 --> 20:10.582
Julian told us that you tricked
him and Brooke and Quinn.

20:10.666 --> 20:13.468
Oh!
Hey, look, it's a wolf!

20:13.536 --> 20:16.304
You see, now, I'm the boy
who cried "wolf," too, so...

20:16.372 --> 20:17.639
Yeah, yeah, it's true.

20:17.706 --> 20:19.441
I-I did.
I did trick them.

20:19.509 --> 20:20.892
But right now,
it's not a trick,

20:20.977 --> 20:22.844
and we actually need
to go to the hospital.

20:22.895 --> 20:24.879
Are you serious?
Like, right now, right now?

20:24.931 --> 20:28.517
Okay, uh, I --

29:25.423 --> 29:27.091
I mean,
how do you not find --

29:27.158 --> 29:29.360
a smashed-up,
dark-colored grand wagoneer.

29:29.427 --> 29:32.713
Yeah.
I know. Julian told us.

29:32.797 --> 29:35.716
Well, it's like you said.

29:35.817 --> 29:38.969
Whoever it is, they have
to live with what they did.

29:39.020 --> 29:41.438
♪ They told you ♪

29:41.506 --> 29:44.642
♪ "that girl is trouble ♪

29:44.693 --> 29:46.977
♪ she's a player" ♪

29:47.028 --> 29:48.862
Step away from the bar.

29:48.947 --> 29:50.514
Why?

29:50.565 --> 29:52.399
Because you do two things
when you're feeling vulnerable.

29:52.484 --> 29:54.451
- How do you know?
- Because I know you, Alex.

29:54.519 --> 29:57.037
You do shots,
and you do boys.

30:01.993 --> 30:04.295
And there's the second one.
New boyfriend?

30:04.362 --> 30:07.247
I don't know.
Just somebody I met.

30:07.332 --> 30:09.583
Change is
a whisper, Alex.

30:09.668 --> 30:11.502
It's a season.

30:11.553 --> 30:16.039
It's slow and quiet,
and it's not very dramatic.

30:16.091 --> 30:18.258
But it's up to you.

30:18.343 --> 30:20.594
This one's on me.

30:20.679 --> 30:24.264
Your song is good.

30:24.349 --> 30:28.519
♪ Us kissing, holding hands ♪

30:28.570 --> 30:30.988
What a day.

30:31.055 --> 30:33.324
♪ This armada girl's
gone mad ♪

30:33.391 --> 30:35.743
Root beer?

30:37.529 --> 30:39.496
Chase bought it for me.

30:39.564 --> 30:43.534
Well, don't you have any Tequila
shots you need me to do for you?

30:43.585 --> 30:46.003
My girl went on a rant.

30:46.070 --> 30:47.204
Your girl's
about to be fired.

30:47.255 --> 30:48.422
What? Why?

30:48.490 --> 30:49.590
Yeah, what? Why?

30:49.674 --> 30:51.258
Because Jerry
did not love it,

30:51.343 --> 30:53.577
and because chickens aren't
supposed to give opinion.

30:53.628 --> 30:54.962
It was social commentary.

30:55.046 --> 30:56.797
What was?
It was so dumb.

30:56.881 --> 30:59.683
What was dumb? Millie went
live and called stupid stupid.

30:59.751 --> 31:01.352
In a chicken suit.

31:01.419 --> 31:02.586
Nice.

31:02.637 --> 31:04.555
Jerry said he was
getting complaints.

31:04.606 --> 31:05.556
I'm doomed.

31:07.108 --> 31:09.426
Uh, excuse me, ladies.

31:09.477 --> 31:11.311
I just need to know
if you're, um --

31:11.396 --> 31:12.813
Yeah, hi. Alex Dupré.

31:12.897 --> 31:14.598
No, actually --
I actually meant

31:14.649 --> 31:16.483
are you
the angry chicken reporter?

31:20.155 --> 31:21.488
That's me.

31:21.573 --> 31:23.407
I knew it.

31:23.458 --> 31:25.876
I -- that was awesome,
by the way.

31:25.943 --> 31:27.745
Just, uh, c-can I have
your autograph?

31:27.796 --> 31:28.912
Sure.

31:31.949 --> 31:33.667
What is it?

31:33.752 --> 31:35.169
It's your contract
with the agency.

31:35.253 --> 31:38.255
Yeah,
it's a standard thing, Ian.

31:38.306 --> 31:41.558
Well,
I'll tell you what --

31:41.626 --> 31:43.293
me and Tommy here
against you guys

31:43.344 --> 31:44.511
in a game of beer pong.

31:44.596 --> 31:47.097
If we lose,
I'll sign your contract.

31:47.148 --> 31:49.650
But if you lose,
I don't.

31:49.734 --> 31:51.685
Come on, Ian.
We don't want to play games.

31:51.770 --> 31:53.020
What's the matter?

31:53.104 --> 31:54.605
You afraid of getting
your ass beat, Scott?

31:54.656 --> 31:57.024
You understand I used to be
in the NBA, yes?

31:57.108 --> 31:59.309
And you understand that I can
hit any part of the plate

31:59.360 --> 32:01.144
from 60 feet away, yes?

32:04.982 --> 32:07.317
Drink up, Kellerman.

32:14.375 --> 32:17.261
Well, since we don't know
the sex, I like yellow.

32:17.328 --> 32:18.562
Julian likes green.

32:18.630 --> 32:21.164
Why don't you just paint
the room black?

32:21.216 --> 32:23.934
Black?
It would be like a cave.

32:24.001 --> 32:25.886
I know.
It'd be awesome.

32:25.970 --> 32:27.604
I had a friend named Peyton

32:27.672 --> 32:30.173
who had a black room
when she was your age.

32:30.225 --> 32:31.442
She was adopted, too.

32:33.194 --> 32:38.148
You know, you could
really help me with this

32:38.199 --> 32:40.517
if you would just tell us
the sex.

32:40.568 --> 32:42.736
I don't know it, and I really
don't want to know it.

32:44.989 --> 32:47.124
Um, I'm sorry.

32:47.191 --> 32:48.242
I didn't even think --

32:48.326 --> 32:49.943
It's okay.

32:50.011 --> 32:52.963
I'm just really tired.
I'm gonna go.

32:53.030 --> 32:54.798
Okay.

32:54.866 --> 32:56.633
Can I drive you
somewhere, or --

32:56.701 --> 32:58.635
oh, no, I -- I have
my motorcycle.

32:58.703 --> 33:01.321
You ride a motorcycle?

33:01.389 --> 33:03.257
No.

33:03.341 --> 33:04.892
I have a Prius.

33:04.976 --> 33:08.896
But the look on your face
is priceless.

33:11.215 --> 33:12.900
I'm fine, I promise.

33:12.967 --> 33:15.686
Thanks for letting me
hang out today.

33:22.827 --> 33:25.028
No matter what color
you paint it,

33:25.079 --> 33:27.014
it's gonna be
a really nice room.

33:31.402 --> 33:34.037
I'm sure this baby's gonna have
an awesome life.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.675
Chuck!

34:04.715 --> 34:06.699
Hey, Chuck!

34:06.750 --> 34:10.469
Go away, Mr. Meathole.
I told you to leave me alone.

34:10.536 --> 34:12.871
What?
I-it's me -- Chase.

34:21.514 --> 34:22.764
What do you want?

34:22.850 --> 34:24.984
Come to laugh
at me some more?

34:25.052 --> 34:28.321
No. I came to say
I'm sorry about that.

34:28.388 --> 34:31.658
Okay? I'm sorry.

34:31.725 --> 34:33.659
Now put some clothes on
and get out here.

34:33.726 --> 34:35.777
Where are we going?

34:35.862 --> 34:37.730
Dude, it's late on a school night.
Does it matter?

34:37.781 --> 34:39.916
Good point. Wait up.

34:43.404 --> 34:46.839
Man, I thought we were gonna
boost a car or something.

34:46.907 --> 34:48.241
Just put them on.

34:51.128 --> 34:52.795
I better not be
getting punk'd.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.847
You're not.

34:59.386 --> 35:00.887
And no laughing.

35:00.938 --> 35:02.638
No laughing.

35:19.373 --> 35:22.208
All right.
Let's see what you got.

35:32.803 --> 35:34.470
Chuck!

35:34.555 --> 35:37.423
I think you need glasses.

35:37.474 --> 35:39.642
Yep.

35:43.680 --> 35:44.931
Nice hit.

35:50.020 --> 35:52.772
Whoo.

35:52.823 --> 35:55.525
There you go.
Attaboy.

35:55.609 --> 35:57.693
Whoo.

36:02.833 --> 36:04.867
What are you looking at,
girl I love?

36:06.336 --> 36:10.540
My sexy bartender boyfriend
who always helps me.

36:10.624 --> 36:12.008
You mean the one
who feels bad

36:12.076 --> 36:13.643
about giving you
the crummy advice?

36:13.710 --> 36:15.161
You didn't.

36:15.212 --> 36:17.463
It felt good
to say what I said.

36:17.514 --> 36:19.682
And if I get fired,
I get fired.

36:21.668 --> 36:25.772
It's Jerry.
I don't want to get fired.

36:27.691 --> 36:29.609
Hi, Jerry.

36:31.278 --> 36:32.979
Uh-huh.

36:33.046 --> 36:34.530
Uh-huh.

36:36.183 --> 36:37.817
Okay.

36:37.868 --> 36:40.620
Thanks.

36:43.574 --> 36:47.026
He said the switchboards
were jammed all day.

36:47.077 --> 36:48.744
Oh, that's bad.

36:48.829 --> 36:51.581
Well...
It would have been,

36:51.665 --> 36:55.534
except
He said they liked me.

36:55.586 --> 36:57.536
He said I'm a hit,

36:57.588 --> 37:00.673
and they want me to do
social commentary from now on.

37:04.061 --> 37:06.429
