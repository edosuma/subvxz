WEBVTT

00:01.351 --> 00:04.152
I didn't sleep
at all last night.

00:04.252 --> 00:05.885
I miss Frankie already.

00:05.985 --> 00:07.252
- Me, too, Sig.

00:07.352 --> 00:09.318
But we have to be
strong for each other.

00:09.418 --> 00:11.285
I'm here to help out with
whatever you need.

00:11.385 --> 00:12.952
- One of us needs
to tell Jenny.

00:13.052 --> 00:14.152
- Except that.

00:14.252 --> 00:15.585
- Tell me what?

00:18.952 --> 00:22.118
- I guess there isn't
an easy way to say this.

00:22.218 --> 00:23.885
Frankie, could you
give us a minute?

00:23.985 --> 00:25.018
- Sure, Mom.

00:25.118 --> 00:26.518
Frankie?!!

00:26.618 --> 00:28.718
- Yes, Mom?
Yes, Dad?

00:28.818 --> 00:30.452
- Uh... nothing.

00:32.818 --> 00:34.518
- Jenny, what the heck
is going on here?

00:34.618 --> 00:36.185
- I should be asking
you the same thing.

00:36.285 --> 00:37.485
- Uh, this is
not about us.

00:37.585 --> 00:39.918
- I'm very disappointed
in you two.

00:40.018 --> 00:41.518
How could you do
this to Frankie?

00:41.618 --> 00:43.285
- She's using our
lines against us.

00:43.385 --> 00:44.718
This is all you.

00:45.952 --> 00:47.452
- That's a fair question.

00:47.552 --> 00:49.552
But there's
no easy answer.

00:49.652 --> 00:51.885
I love Frankie more
than anything in this world.

00:53.718 --> 00:56.452
- I love you and Frankie more
than anything in this world.

00:57.752 --> 00:59.752
- I love Frankie,
you and your father

00:59.852 --> 01:02.018
more than anything
in this world.

01:02.118 --> 01:03.452
But, Jenny...

01:03.552 --> 01:06.452
she's become unpredictable
and, worse, violent.

01:06.518 --> 01:08.285
I can't continue
down this path.

01:08.452 --> 01:09.585
- Again.

01:09.685 --> 01:11.285
- Shutting down Frankie

01:11.452 --> 01:13.185
is for the safety of
everyone, including yours.

01:13.285 --> 01:14.818
It has to be done.

01:18.185 --> 01:19.252
- Hello?

01:19.352 --> 01:21.152
Yes, this is Mr. Gaines.

01:21.252 --> 01:22.618
Really?

01:22.718 --> 01:24.885
Thank you so
much for the call.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.085
Fantastic news!

01:26.185 --> 01:28.052
- You are not ordering
another cereal dispenser.

01:28.152 --> 01:29.285
You already broke two.

01:29.452 --> 01:30.818
- No, that was Ms. Hough
from Frankie's school.

01:30.918 --> 01:32.452
Frankie's been cleared!
- Cleared? Are you sure?

01:32.552 --> 01:33.752
- One hundred percent.

01:33.852 --> 01:35.552
They have video
of another student

01:35.652 --> 01:38.085
breaking into the lockers
where the robot was taken.

01:39.218 --> 01:41.585
- Frankie, could
you come in here.

01:44.452 --> 01:46.252
Your dad just got off
the phone with Ms. Hough,

01:46.352 --> 01:47.785
and your suspension's
been cleared.

01:47.885 --> 01:49.952
- Does that mean
I can go to the dance?

01:50.052 --> 01:51.552
- Yeah, can she?
- Yeah, can she?

01:51.652 --> 01:53.485
- I'm happy you
were cleared,

01:53.585 --> 01:56.118
but that doesn't explain
your deleted files,

01:56.218 --> 01:57.552
and I have to sort
through all this

01:57.652 --> 01:59.018
before making
a decision.

01:59.118 --> 02:01.185
- Can I at least go
to Brain Squad practice?

02:01.285 --> 02:02.618
- Yeah, can she?
- Yeah, can she?

02:02.718 --> 02:04.552
- We have to prepare for
the state championships,

02:04.652 --> 02:06.518
and the team
is counting on me.

02:07.718 --> 02:08.852
- Fine.

02:08.952 --> 02:10.651
But you have to come right
home when it's finished.

02:10.752 --> 02:12.252
Yes!

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:21.818 --> 02:24.318
- I'm yellow, filled
with vitamins.

02:24.452 --> 02:27.185
- Oh, you're a super
B-complex supplement.

02:27.285 --> 02:29.652
- No!
I'm the banana emoji.

02:29.752 --> 02:31.318
- No one's gonna
know that.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.152
- Of course, they will.

02:33.252 --> 02:34.685
At 11.4 pounds
per person per year,

02:34.785 --> 02:37.552
bananas are the most consumed
fruit in the United States.

02:37.652 --> 02:39.485
What emoji are
you going as?

02:43.185 --> 02:44.452
- A heart.

02:44.552 --> 02:47.118
- I don't think you're getting
the whole emoji concept.

02:48.852 --> 02:50.652
- Did you hear
the news about Robbie?

02:50.752 --> 02:53.452
He was suspended for
destroying Byron's robot.

02:53.518 --> 02:55.618
- I'm sorry, Tammy,
now you don't have a date.

02:55.718 --> 02:57.452
You must be pretty upset.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.518
- On the contrary.
I'm ecstatic!

03:00.618 --> 03:01.818
I'm the one who
set him up.

03:01.918 --> 03:03.718
- But Frankie got
suspended for that,

03:03.818 --> 03:05.085
and she's your sworn enemy.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.885
Why would you frame
someone else for the crime?

03:07.985 --> 03:09.218
- Don't be naive.

03:09.318 --> 03:10.585
I'm playing
the long game.

03:10.685 --> 03:11.685
Frankie's suspension

03:11.785 --> 03:13.685
only strengthened
her social standing.

03:13.785 --> 03:15.785
The whole school joined
the "Free Frankie" movement.

03:15.885 --> 03:18.485
Don't bother
making costumes.

03:18.585 --> 03:20.552
Frankie's gonna
win best costume,

03:20.652 --> 03:22.452
and I'm gonna make
sure of it.

03:22.518 --> 03:23.818
- Are we in bizarre world?

03:23.918 --> 03:25.552
Why do you keep
helping Frankie?

03:25.652 --> 03:27.352
- Because, when she
goes up to accept

03:27.452 --> 03:29.118
that best costume award,

03:29.218 --> 03:30.718
I'm gonna dowse
her in water

03:30.818 --> 03:32.485
and expose that
she's a robot...

03:32.585 --> 03:34.252
In front of
the whole school.

03:44.752 --> 03:47.718
- "Reward for any information
about the girl in this photo

03:47.818 --> 03:50.685
wanted in connection
with cyber crimes"?

03:50.785 --> 03:52.518
- I'll take that,
Ms. Reyes.

03:52.618 --> 03:55.252
- Ms. Hough, um,
what is that?

03:55.352 --> 03:56.485
Should I be worried?

03:56.585 --> 03:57.585
- Apparently there's
a cyber criminal

03:57.685 --> 04:00.185
wandering around one
of the area schools.

04:00.285 --> 04:01.352
I was asked to distribute

04:01.452 --> 04:02.885
these flyers around
our hallways.

04:02.985 --> 04:05.518
- Wait! There's
more of these?

04:05.618 --> 04:07.452
I mean...

04:07.485 --> 04:10.085
let me know if I can
do anything to help.

04:24.152 --> 04:25.285
- Oh, no.

04:25.452 --> 04:26.985
I've gotta warn Frankie.

04:50.305 --> 04:53.172
Hm, and there
are many of these?

04:58.372 --> 05:00.638
- Everything about
this is bad, Frankie.

05:00.738 --> 05:02.738
It's bad news,
bad timing.

05:02.838 --> 05:04.005
Even your hair
looks bad.

05:04.105 --> 05:05.472
- My hair?
- Sorry.

05:05.572 --> 05:06.572
I'm just on edge.

05:06.605 --> 05:08.105
I took out all
the flyers at Sepulveda,

05:08.205 --> 05:10.872
but they must be up
at every school in the county.

05:10.972 --> 05:13.405
We need to make sure
no one calls this tip line.

05:13.572 --> 05:16.572
- I'm sorry, Dayton Reyes,
but we cannot.

05:19.405 --> 05:22.105
- What about
intercepting calls

05:22.205 --> 05:25.005
like you did when Ms. Hough
tried to call your mom?

05:25.105 --> 05:27.038
- That was
my home network.

05:27.138 --> 05:29.072
If I tapped into EGG's network,
I could reveal my location.

05:29.172 --> 05:31.572
- I'm not talking
about hacking them.

05:31.605 --> 05:33.972
I'm talking about overloading
their phone system.

05:34.072 --> 05:36.705
How many calls can
you place per hour?

05:36.805 --> 05:37.805
- With my voice
broadcasting software,

05:37.905 --> 05:39.572
I can place over
200 calls per minute.

05:39.638 --> 05:43.638
- Oh, and I can do about
a hundred a minute online.

05:43.738 --> 05:44.805
That's pretty good.

05:44.905 --> 05:46.705
But we don't know
their capacity.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.772
It wouldn't hurt
to do some more.

05:49.872 --> 05:53.305
Hey, Jenny, would
you be willing...

05:53.405 --> 05:56.872
- Oh, I'm in.
- How did you...?

05:56.972 --> 06:00.138
- Guys, I'm ten.
Eavesdropping is my life.

06:00.238 --> 06:02.572
I'll get the snacks.

06:05.372 --> 06:06.772
Sure,
I've seen that girl.

06:06.872 --> 06:09.305
She goes to
San Vicente High.

06:09.405 --> 06:11.238
That girl
is my next door neighbor.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.572
PS, I think
she might be a witch.

06:13.638 --> 06:15.572
I know the girl
you are seeking.

06:15.672 --> 06:18.472
She is highly intelligent
and has an excellent haircut.

06:18.572 --> 06:20.705
The number you
have reached is not in service.

06:20.805 --> 06:22.238
Please try your
call again later.

06:22.338 --> 06:24.438
- We did it.
We crashed the system.

06:28.238 --> 06:30.938
- Oh, no, we're gonna
be late for school!

06:34.172 --> 06:35.805
- I need coffee, stat.

06:35.905 --> 06:37.938
- I don't think so.

06:38.038 --> 06:39.872
- Mom, have you
completed your analysis

06:39.972 --> 06:41.938
about whether I can
go to the dance?

06:42.038 --> 06:44.372
- I have, Frankie.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.272
I've given this
a lot of thought,

06:46.372 --> 06:49.472
and I've come to
the conclusion that...

06:49.572 --> 06:50.605
I can't risk you going.

06:50.705 --> 06:52.072
- What?!

06:52.172 --> 06:54.838
Dr. Gaines, you have to dance
Frankie to let her go.

06:54.938 --> 06:56.372
- I'm sorry,
what was that?

06:56.472 --> 06:59.005
- That came out wrong.
Let me try that again.

06:59.105 --> 07:03.038
This is our first dance,
a rite of passage,

07:03.138 --> 07:06.438
the higher social couldn't
be at any more stakes.

07:06.572 --> 07:09.072
- Did you girls get
enough sleep last night?

07:09.172 --> 07:12.638
- Of course.
We are totally sharp.

07:12.738 --> 07:13.738
Right, Jenny?

07:17.338 --> 07:19.772
- Listen, someone
is trying to hurt Frankie,

07:19.872 --> 07:23.905
and the dance poses a huge
safety risk we can't take.

07:24.005 --> 07:25.905
- But, Mom...
- No.

07:26.005 --> 07:28.738
I'm sorry, Frankie.
That's final.

07:35.456 --> 07:37.090
- Hey, Tammy.

07:40.123 --> 07:41.390
- We got your text.

07:41.490 --> 07:42.390
What's so important?

07:42.490 --> 07:43.723
This.

07:43.890 --> 07:45.890
- An animated GIF
of a pulley system?

07:45.923 --> 07:48.523
- It's not just
any pulley system.

07:48.623 --> 07:50.590
I call it the T4000.

07:50.690 --> 07:52.756
- You designed this?

07:52.890 --> 07:54.723
- Well... no.

07:54.890 --> 07:55.956
I searched for it online.

07:56.056 --> 07:58.790
But we're gonna build
something just like it.

07:58.890 --> 08:00.556
The dump bucket will
be above the stage,

08:00.656 --> 08:02.623
the pulley will be hidden
in the wings,

08:02.723 --> 08:04.123
and the robot Frankie Gaines

08:04.223 --> 08:07.523
is gonna short-circuit
like a busted toaster.

08:09.090 --> 08:10.323
- No way.
- We're out.

08:10.423 --> 08:11.556
- Where are you going?

08:11.656 --> 08:13.456
I need you two.

08:13.556 --> 08:15.723
- That was pretty sweet.

08:16.890 --> 08:18.623
- Fine. We'll do it
under one condition.

08:18.723 --> 08:20.490
When you're
proven wrong,

08:20.590 --> 08:22.390
you drop this
obsession for good,

08:22.490 --> 08:24.323
so we can focus
on winning state's.

08:24.423 --> 08:25.690
- Deal.

08:25.790 --> 08:29.623
Now where can we find
a really long rope?

08:31.356 --> 08:33.356
- Hurry up!
- Almost got it.

08:36.456 --> 08:37.923
I'm okay.

08:38.023 --> 08:39.190
Really, I'm okay.

08:46.323 --> 08:48.790
- Aha! Gotcha.

08:50.723 --> 08:53.590
Uh, I... I was
just leaving.

09:00.323 --> 09:02.890
Works like a charm.

09:08.790 --> 09:10.590
- You know,
I was thinking...

09:10.690 --> 09:12.790
maybe I could
live-stream the dance.

09:12.890 --> 09:15.156
It'll be almost
as good as being there.

09:15.256 --> 09:16.690
- I appreciate the offer,

09:16.790 --> 09:18.690
but I fear the video quality
wouldn't be sufficient

09:18.790 --> 09:20.456
to create an immersive
experience.

09:20.556 --> 09:22.723
- I'm really
sorry, Frankie.

09:22.890 --> 09:25.623
This is so not fair.

09:25.723 --> 09:27.790
- Any news?
- Yeah, any news?

09:27.890 --> 09:30.390
- I'm afraid I can't go to
the dance with either of you.

09:30.490 --> 09:32.356
My mom will not
let me go at all.

09:32.456 --> 09:34.790
Great.

09:37.523 --> 09:39.490
- Hey, it's no big deal.

09:39.590 --> 09:40.990
It's just one
stupid dance.

09:41.090 --> 09:42.690
- Bite your tongue.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.123
Uh, I mean...
he's right.

09:45.223 --> 09:47.023
It's just a dance.

09:47.123 --> 09:49.890
- There will be
other dances, right?

09:49.990 --> 09:52.523
- It's true. There will
be many other dances.

09:52.623 --> 09:54.690
Although I don't know
that I will be permitted

09:54.790 --> 09:56.990
to attend any of them.

09:59.990 --> 10:02.423
- Oh, I feel so selfish
even going now.

10:02.523 --> 10:03.756
How am I supposed
to enjoy myself

10:03.856 --> 10:07.190
knowing Frankie's
gonna be alone all night.

10:07.290 --> 10:09.456
- Let's not go
overboard now.

10:09.556 --> 10:10.823
You gave it
your best shot.

10:10.923 --> 10:13.090
- I just wish there was
something more I could do.

10:14.256 --> 10:16.056
- Hey, girlfriend.
How you holding up?

10:16.156 --> 10:17.523
- I'm fine, I guess.

10:17.623 --> 10:19.423
- I wanted to give
my old pal a call,

10:19.523 --> 10:20.956
check in,
see how you're doin'.

10:21.056 --> 10:22.756
- She's gone, James.
- You mean it?

10:22.856 --> 10:25.356
- Frankie's back at school,
away from my watchful eye.

10:25.456 --> 10:29.790
I'm glad she was exonerated
and the suspension was lifted.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.223
- Ow!

10:31.323 --> 10:33.756
- But I have this feeling that
someone's trying to harm her.

10:33.856 --> 10:35.723
What was that noise?

10:35.823 --> 10:39.156
- Uh... my doorbell.

10:39.256 --> 10:40.923
Gotta run.
Talk to ya later.

10:44.990 --> 10:46.923
Maybe I'm going about
this all wrong.

10:47.023 --> 10:49.523
If Sigourney won't
get rid of Frankie,

10:49.623 --> 10:51.323
I need someone who will.

10:52.656 --> 10:55.223
- Hey, Frankie.
What ya doin'?

10:55.323 --> 10:57.156
- Running a regression analysis
on the probability

10:57.256 --> 10:59.556
of me having fun if I'd
gone to tonight's dance.

10:59.656 --> 11:01.190
- Regression
analysis, huh?

11:01.290 --> 11:04.723
I do advanced statistical
modeling when I'm upset, too.

11:04.890 --> 11:06.323
You must be my daughter.

11:06.423 --> 11:07.356
- I am your daughter.

11:07.456 --> 11:08.956
- Oh, that was a...

11:09.056 --> 11:11.690
Frankie, you understand
that I'm not letting you

11:11.790 --> 11:14.123
go to the dance
to protect you, right?

11:14.223 --> 11:15.890
- Logically, I understand
your reasoning...

11:15.923 --> 11:17.990
Though it does not make
me feel any better.

11:18.090 --> 11:20.756
I have an uneasy feeling
that is tough to describe.

11:20.890 --> 11:23.223
It's called FOMO.

11:23.323 --> 11:24.423
I have it, too.

11:24.523 --> 11:26.056
Fear Of Missing Out.

11:26.156 --> 11:28.456
- Is this something
that teens experience?

11:28.556 --> 11:30.223
- Which one of you's
the robot, again?

11:30.323 --> 11:32.890
- Human teens?

11:32.923 --> 11:35.356
- I hate to break up
this little lovefest,

11:35.456 --> 11:36.690
but I made some
food for everyone.

11:36.790 --> 11:37.656
- Jenny made food?

11:37.756 --> 11:39.690
- That's nice
of you, sweetie,

11:39.790 --> 11:41.556
but Frankie's stomach
is still new,

11:41.656 --> 11:44.790
and I don't know...
- Would you just come on?

11:51.656 --> 11:54.690
- What in
the worldwide web?

11:56.690 --> 11:57.990
Can I interest
you in a sophisticated

11:58.090 --> 11:59.890
and elegant
pig-in-a-blanket?

11:59.923 --> 12:01.456
- What is all of this?

12:01.556 --> 12:03.556
The Emoji Ball 2.0.

12:10.156 --> 12:13.890
- Dr. Gaines, if Frankie
can't go to the dance,

12:13.956 --> 12:15.690
the dance has to
come to Frankie.

12:15.790 --> 12:18.490
- But, Dayton, what about
your date with Byron?

12:18.590 --> 12:20.623
The dance is supposed
to be super-fab,

12:20.723 --> 12:22.590
one of the most important
nights of your life.

12:22.690 --> 12:25.423
- Not more important
than my best friend.

12:27.423 --> 12:28.623
- Will,
can I talk to you?

12:28.723 --> 12:30.156
- Not now, hon,
I'm working.

12:30.256 --> 12:31.123
- Oh!

12:31.223 --> 12:32.590
Tell me I'm doing
the right thing

12:32.690 --> 12:34.290
by not letting Frankie
go to the dance.

12:34.390 --> 12:35.723
- I could tell you that,

12:35.890 --> 12:37.890
or I could tell you that
part of being a parent

12:37.923 --> 12:39.890
is learning how to
deal with risk.

12:39.923 --> 12:41.956
We could wait
outside the school

12:42.056 --> 12:43.423
in the car,
just to be safe.

12:43.523 --> 12:44.990
We can watch a movie
on my laptop...

12:45.090 --> 12:47.356
Just like our old dates
at the drive-in.

12:47.456 --> 12:50.423
- You never took me to
the drive-in movie theater.

12:50.523 --> 12:51.626
Who did you take
to the drive-in?

12:51.681 --> 12:53.714
- Oh, Frankie, we have
some good news.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.881
- Your dad and I were
just talking and...

12:55.981 --> 12:57.448
we've decided...

12:57.548 --> 13:00.214
- to let you go to the dance!
- Yay!

13:00.314 --> 13:02.548
- Ow, Frankie,
you're crushing my hands.

13:02.648 --> 13:03.714
- Sorry, Dayton Reyes.

13:03.814 --> 13:05.181
Well done, Sig.

13:05.281 --> 13:06.548
Look at how happy she is.

13:06.581 --> 13:08.281
I hope
I'm doing the right thing.

13:08.381 --> 13:09.448
- Of course, you are.

13:09.548 --> 13:11.148
It's a school dance.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.048
What's the worst
that can happen?

13:20.822 --> 13:22.922
- Does that face
mean you told Cole

13:23.022 --> 13:24.722
you're going to
the dance with Andrew?

13:24.806 --> 13:26.640
And how'd he take it?

13:26.722 --> 13:27.756
- Are grunting noises
and deep-breathing

13:27.856 --> 13:30.222
typically a sign
of unhappiness in humans?

13:30.322 --> 13:32.656
Then he does not
appear happy.

13:32.689 --> 13:35.022
- Come on, the dance starts
in less than an hour.

13:35.122 --> 13:37.322
We're not gonna let
anything ruin this night.

13:39.956 --> 13:41.722
- Oh!
- Watch out!

13:46.656 --> 13:48.022
If you hurt me,

13:48.122 --> 13:49.989
Mr. Kingston will never
deliver the android.

13:50.089 --> 13:51.822
I'll never talk.

13:53.356 --> 13:55.656
Please, a laser pointer.

13:55.756 --> 13:58.156
How 2004 of you.

14:00.222 --> 14:01.956
What... what is that?

14:02.056 --> 14:03.989
Oh! Let me talk
to Mr. Kingston.

14:04.089 --> 14:07.689
I can get you
your android.

14:10.656 --> 14:13.256
Every time I walk
through these halls.

14:13.356 --> 14:14.756
Hello?

14:14.856 --> 14:16.889
Mr. Kingston, you're
a sound for a sore circuit.

14:16.989 --> 14:19.256
- PEGSI! PEGSI!
Oh, thank goodness.

14:19.356 --> 14:20.689
Are you hurt?

14:20.789 --> 14:22.656
If they damaged one LED on
your little egg-shaped head,

14:22.756 --> 14:24.056
I swear I will...

14:24.156 --> 14:25.856
- Have we located the android
yet, sir, by any chance?

14:25.956 --> 14:29.189
- The android, um, oh,
hang on, hang on, hang on.

14:30.322 --> 14:32.522
Is the tip line up
and running again?

14:32.656 --> 14:35.389
No, we're working
on it, PEGSI.

14:35.489 --> 14:36.722
It... oh, dear,
hold on, hold on.

14:36.822 --> 14:40.089
- I've got another call.
- No, Mr. Kingston...

14:40.189 --> 14:41.456
- Gilford Kingston.

14:41.556 --> 14:44.322
- You're not an easy man to
get in touch with, Kingston.

14:44.422 --> 14:46.156
- How did you get
this number?

14:46.256 --> 14:47.456
- That's not important.

14:47.556 --> 14:51.056
What is important is
the proposition I have for you.

14:52.556 --> 14:54.089
I don't do business
with traitors.

14:54.189 --> 14:56.689
- I think you may change
your tune when...

14:56.789 --> 14:58.656
Hello?

14:58.689 --> 15:00.189
Hello?

15:01.722 --> 15:03.056
How rude!

15:20.456 --> 15:23.822
On a scale of one to amaze,
tell me, what do you think?

15:23.922 --> 15:26.456
- It's even more beautiful
than I thought it would be.

15:26.556 --> 15:29.322
- So, shall we dance?

15:51.489 --> 15:53.022
- Mind if I cut in?

15:53.122 --> 15:55.156
- Yeah.

15:55.256 --> 15:57.722
- Andrew, according to Miss
Etiquette's "Book of Etiquette,"

15:57.822 --> 15:59.022
it is inappropriate
for either member

15:59.122 --> 16:01.489
of a dance pair to refuse
a request to cut in.

16:12.256 --> 16:14.089
- You're the cutest robot
I've ever seen.

16:14.189 --> 16:16.189
- How do you...
- Your costume.

16:16.289 --> 16:17.356
It's awesome.

16:17.456 --> 16:19.322
- Of course.

16:19.422 --> 16:21.089
Thank you.

16:26.522 --> 16:28.789
- Wow, everyone
went all out.

16:28.889 --> 16:31.289
Look at all
these costumes.

16:31.389 --> 16:34.422
They're so much more
creative than ours.

16:34.522 --> 16:35.756
- That's not our fault.

16:35.856 --> 16:37.389
We were caught up
helping someone

16:37.489 --> 16:39.389
with her water prank.
- Shhhh!

16:39.489 --> 16:41.389
And stop complaining.

16:41.489 --> 16:43.222
This is serious
business.

16:48.856 --> 16:51.056
- So, uh,
should we dance?

16:51.156 --> 16:52.856
- I thought you'd
never ask.

16:55.722 --> 16:57.556
- You are talking
to Bob, aren't you?

16:57.656 --> 16:58.989
Maybe.

16:59.089 --> 17:00.722
I'm just happy
I was able to fix

17:00.822 --> 17:02.322
the little guy
in time for tonight.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.656
He didn't wanna miss it.

17:04.689 --> 17:07.489
Come on, both of you.

17:14.689 --> 17:16.955
- All right, all right,
all right!

17:17.056 --> 17:20.189
I hope your emojis are
havin' a great time.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.388
Remember, voting for
best costume is open,

17:23.489 --> 17:26.989
so, grab those phones,
go to the virtual vote app,

17:27.089 --> 17:29.656
and pick your favesy.

17:39.289 --> 17:40.356
- Tammy?

17:40.456 --> 17:42.122
In here.

17:50.489 --> 17:51.889
- What are you doing?

17:51.989 --> 17:53.456
- Isn't it obvious?

17:53.556 --> 17:55.656
- Actually... no.

17:55.722 --> 17:57.022
- I'm hacking
the virtual vote app

17:57.122 --> 17:59.556
so that Frankie
wins best costume.

17:59.656 --> 18:01.189
Close the door.

18:03.656 --> 18:04.789
- Hey, don't break
my heart.

18:04.889 --> 18:06.956
- Stop pushing.
- Careful.

18:07.056 --> 18:09.522
- Watch out for my heart.
- Okay, watch it.

18:09.656 --> 18:10.956
- Guys...

18:12.489 --> 18:15.022
The security is stronger
than I'd anticipated.

18:15.122 --> 18:16.989
They're using
tls fallback scsv.

18:17.089 --> 18:19.222
But I can crack it.

18:19.322 --> 18:22.922
Oh, no.
Why is it frozen?

18:23.022 --> 18:25.422
- I think you
crashed the app.

18:25.522 --> 18:26.789
Nice one.

18:26.889 --> 18:28.056
- No, no, no, no.
This can't be.

18:28.156 --> 18:30.056
This is a disaster!

18:30.156 --> 18:31.789
My whole plan is ruined!

18:31.889 --> 18:33.356
Unless...

18:33.456 --> 18:34.889
I can figure out a way

18:34.989 --> 18:37.189
to get Frankie
near that bucket of water.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.922
- Listen up!
Listen up!

18:46.022 --> 18:49.856
I just got word that
the voting app is down.

18:49.956 --> 18:51.322
Ouch!

18:51.422 --> 18:52.289
But don't fret.

18:52.389 --> 18:54.222
We'll be passing
out paper ballots

18:54.322 --> 18:56.756
so you can still vote
for best costume

18:56.856 --> 19:00.222
here at Sepulveda's
first Emoji Ball!

19:13.122 --> 19:15.956
- Hey, Andrew, I thought
Frankie was your date.

19:16.056 --> 19:17.689
How come she keeps
dancing with Cole?

19:24.689 --> 19:27.356
- Something
on your mind?

19:27.456 --> 19:29.422
I'm surprised to see
you out here alone.

19:29.522 --> 19:31.656
I thought you'd be shredding
the dance floor with Frankie.

19:31.722 --> 19:34.222
- Why does everyone care so
much about me and Frankie?

19:38.689 --> 19:44.256
- Ah, I see. You're
embarrassed, upset, hurt.

19:44.356 --> 19:46.356
How'd you like
to give Frankie

19:46.456 --> 19:48.456
a little taste
of her own medicine?

19:49.989 --> 19:52.589
- Come on, it's not like
I'm gonna hurt her.

19:52.689 --> 19:54.622
Just a little prank.

19:54.722 --> 19:57.156
Totally harmless fun.

20:00.056 --> 20:01.989
- Remember, don't bring
her to the spot

20:02.089 --> 20:04.289
until I give you the sign.
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

20:04.389 --> 20:06.889
- It's the moment you've
all been waiting for.

20:06.989 --> 20:13.756
Time to announce the big winner
of your Emoji Costume Contest!

20:15.656 --> 20:20.922
- Sepulveda High, your winner
for best costume is...

20:21.022 --> 20:23.456
Frankie Gaines!

20:25.556 --> 20:26.889
- What? She won anyway?

20:26.989 --> 20:29.456
- Maybe I should go in there
and check how things are going.

20:29.556 --> 20:30.856
I'm going in.

20:30.956 --> 20:32.656
- How about I go
check, instead?

20:32.756 --> 20:34.156
I'd blend in more.

20:34.256 --> 20:36.422
And I wanna get a look
at a real dance.

20:36.522 --> 20:38.522
- Jenny, that's why we rented
"High School Dance: 22."

20:38.622 --> 20:40.289
It's like we're there,
but we're not there.

20:40.389 --> 20:41.956
- I'd rather see
the real thing.

20:42.056 --> 20:43.656
I'm coming with you.

20:43.756 --> 20:44.956
- Nobody's going anywhere.

20:45.056 --> 20:46.489
Frankie's entitled
to her privacy.

20:49.022 --> 20:51.789
- Come on up here to claim
your prize, Frankie Gaines!

21:05.656 --> 21:06.756
- Frankie, look out!

21:21.556 --> 21:22.656
- Are you okay?

21:22.689 --> 21:24.522
- Yes, I am.

21:24.656 --> 21:27.256
But my costume's not.

21:28.156 --> 21:30.522
- Frankie,
are you all right?

21:30.656 --> 21:32.489
What did you do?

21:38.989 --> 21:40.656
Stop trying to hide.

21:40.722 --> 21:41.789
We see you.

21:41.889 --> 21:43.322
- He's hurt.
We need to help him.

21:43.422 --> 21:44.656
- No!

21:44.689 --> 21:46.556
I mean, I'm fine.

21:55.156 --> 21:56.956
Andrew LaPierre...

21:57.056 --> 21:58.789
are you an android?
