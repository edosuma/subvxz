WEBVTT

00:02.833 --> 00:04.482
Over the past ten weeks

00:04.615 --> 00:07.533
the best dancers in the world

00:07.601 --> 00:10.100
have given it their all...

00:16.467 --> 00:20.933
To prove they are the best in the world.

00:20.933 --> 00:22.467
That's what I'm talking about!

00:24.433 --> 00:28.733
Now only three remain.

00:28.733 --> 00:32.299
Upper Division champions Les Twins...

00:33.967 --> 00:36.933
You guys love performing...

00:36.933 --> 00:39.833
-  Oh!
- And it shows so much.

00:39.833 --> 00:43.767
Junior Division champion Eva Igo...

00:43.767 --> 00:46.967
You are absolutely extraordinary.

00:48.567 --> 00:52.367
And Team Division champions Swing Latino.

00:54.467 --> 00:57.367
That's what this
competition is about.

00:57.367 --> 01:01.467
Tonight, all three go head-to-head

01:01.467 --> 01:05.700
for the biggest prize
in dance history.

01:10.267 --> 01:13.567
The "World" final. This is a big deal.

01:13.567 --> 01:15.033
I'm nervous. I'm not even competing

01:15.033 --> 01:16.700
and I'm nervous.

01:16.700 --> 01:18.267
It's the million-dollar moment.

01:18.267 --> 01:20.233
Each act dances not once...

01:20.233 --> 01:21.144
Oh!

01:21.849 --> 01:22.700
But twice tonight

01:22.800 --> 01:25.733
for $1 million

01:25.733 --> 01:29.200
and the title of the best in the world.

01:32.300 --> 01:35.133
You're walking home
with $1 million.

01:35.133 --> 01:38.567
That is life changing.

01:38.567 --> 01:40.133
This is...

01:44.800 --> 01:48.333
Please welcome your host Jenna Dewan Tatum,

01:50.100 --> 01:51.400
Derek Hough,

01:51.400 --> 01:52.800
NE-YO,

01:52.800 --> 01:54.800
and Jennifer Lopez.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.000
For the first time
in the competition,

01:59.000 --> 02:00.933
they're going up against each other

02:00.933 --> 02:02.900
and they'll be dancing
twice tonight,

02:02.900 --> 02:07.067
and their average score for both
dances will decide the winner.

02:07.067 --> 02:10.733
This is "World of Dance."
The "World" final starts now.

02:12.833 --> 02:13.492
Here we go.

02:13.689 --> 02:15.067
Yes.

02:15.067 --> 02:16.733
We're giving away
a million dollars tonight.

02:16.733 --> 02:18.233
Ooh.

02:19.633 --> 02:23.100
First up, Les Twins.

02:24.533 --> 02:26.300
To be in the "World" final...

02:26.502 --> 02:27.840
__

02:28.933 --> 02:31.200
I never danced like this ever in my life.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.178
Whoo!

02:35.500 --> 02:37.300
Ah!

02:39.767 --> 02:42.233
We never performed like
this with that much power.

02:42.233 --> 02:44.867
We really work hard for it.

02:44.867 --> 02:46.667
__

02:46.667 --> 02:48.500
__

02:48.500 --> 02:51.333
Tonight, when we get on stage,
we just have to do it,

02:51.333 --> 02:52.933
and destroy the whole place.

02:55.367 --> 02:57.600
- Hi, guys.
- What's up?

02:57.600 --> 02:59.400
It's just so beautiful
to have someone

02:59.400 --> 03:01.633
that have a lot of
experience speaking to us.

03:01.633 --> 03:02.933
You won your division.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.367
You're competing for
a million dollars.

03:04.367 --> 03:05.190
How you guys feeling?

03:05.339 --> 03:06.333
- Feeling good.
- Feeling good?

03:06.333 --> 03:08.433
Yo, you're not even

03:08.433 --> 03:11.333
- aware to dance.
- I'm gonna dance anyway.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.300
Nobody wants to hear about the ankle.

03:13.300 --> 03:14.533
I hate to say it,

03:14.533 --> 03:16.500
this is what this business is like.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.833
- That's right.
- He's almost there.

03:17.833 --> 03:19.233
I have to do a show tomorrow night.

03:19.233 --> 03:20.867
Nobody cares I'm sick.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.767
That's what it's like to be
a singer and a performer.

03:23.767 --> 03:26.100
If there is away, he will find a way.

03:26.100 --> 03:27.767
'Cause that's what performers do.

03:27.767 --> 03:31.267
- I'm gonna rock it with it.
- It's gonna be awesome.

03:31.267 --> 03:32.900
We're gonna give you a good final.

03:32.900 --> 03:35.300
You get to have two
performances on the final.

03:35.300 --> 03:37.133
You will get to choose a song,

03:37.133 --> 03:39.633
and then I get to choose a song for you.

03:39.633 --> 03:42.167
I think you should do
"Stole the Show" for the finale

03:42.167 --> 03:44.633
because I think you need
an emotional performance.

03:44.633 --> 03:46.100
Oh, my gosh.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.700
She's looking to see
Les Twins rock it.

03:47.700 --> 03:49.867
- Thank you so much.
- Twin hug.

03:49.867 --> 03:51.833
This is crazy 'cause right
now we're in a final

03:51.833 --> 03:53.467
and the final is no joke.

03:55.567 --> 03:57.133
Good luck. Go out there.

04:03.233 --> 04:04.733
I wanna think that my
brother's gonna kill it.

04:04.733 --> 04:06.133
I wanna think that I'm gonna kill it.

04:06.133 --> 04:07.633
I wanna think that no matter what happens,

04:07.633 --> 04:09.100
we will see who will be the best.

04:09.100 --> 04:10.767
It's gonna be amazing.

04:10.767 --> 04:12.167
Yo, let's do this.

04:16.899 --> 04:18.666
It's a little--
little different walkout

04:18.666 --> 04:20.867
than the very first performance.
Remember how they ran out?

04:50.841 --> 04:51.067
Whoo.

06:10.067 --> 06:12.633
Les Twins!

06:12.633 --> 06:15.867
Okay, seeing that performance,
you guys deserve to be here.

06:15.867 --> 06:18.533
You guys are amazing.

06:18.533 --> 06:20.600
Also, I wasn't sure if you were gonna be

06:20.600 --> 06:22.733
up for the challenge this
week because of the injury,

06:22.733 --> 06:24.167
but I-I can't even tell.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.733
I was a little worried about the platform,

06:27.733 --> 06:30.600
but I liked it 'cause it
focused your movements.

06:30.600 --> 06:31.900
That was really my idea really

06:31.900 --> 06:34.400
to make sure that you guys are focused

06:34.400 --> 06:35.108
on what we're doing.

06:35.867 --> 06:38.800
- That was beautiful, beautiful.
- Thank you.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.733
This performance was pure emotion.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.067
Your artistic decisions,

06:42.067 --> 06:44.200
like, the moves that you guys choose to do.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.200
Like, there's some moves that
kind of feel like dance moves.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.700
and then there's other moves
that kind of feel like,

06:48.700 --> 06:49.984
"What the hell was that?"

06:50.133 --> 06:53.133
Like, I would have never thought to do...

06:53.133 --> 06:55.167
- Yeah.
- It was great to do

06:55.167 --> 06:56.700
the little turn table thing,

06:56.700 --> 06:58.767
and then when it started moving at the end,

06:58.767 --> 07:00.933
we feel that emotion of the two of you

07:00.933 --> 07:02.467
kind of in the center of the world.

07:02.467 --> 07:04.733
I picked "Stole the Show"
for them because I feel like

07:04.733 --> 07:06.500
since the beginning of this competition,

07:06.500 --> 07:08.333
that's exactly what you've been doing.

07:10.533 --> 07:14.100
Great start to what I think
is gonna be an awesome finale.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.600
Thank you.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.833
All right,
let's lock in our scores.

07:17.833 --> 07:18.146
Yeah.

07:26.833 --> 07:28.267
Okay, let's see your
round one score.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.300
All right, all right, here come the scores.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.200
All right.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.633
Obviously, you guys are in first

07:53.633 --> 07:54.800
since your first out.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.267
Congratulations. Good job.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.133
- That's not bad.
- It's not bad, it's not bad.

08:00.133 --> 08:01.367
Yeah, it's not bad at all.

08:01.367 --> 08:02.684
If I get to 80, that would...

08:03.167 --> 08:04.333
- Like, it would be--
- That's, um--yeah.

08:04.333 --> 08:05.800
I'd be crying maybe.

08:11.733 --> 08:15.300
Swing Latino and Eva Igo take the stage.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.233
Yeah!

08:17.233 --> 08:19.500
That is more like it now.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.240
And later...

08:20.397 --> 08:20.867
Whoo!

08:20.867 --> 08:22.833
All three acts...

08:22.833 --> 08:24.633
Perform one last time.

08:24.633 --> 08:27.533
The winner of
"World of Dance" is...

08:37.332 --> 08:40.967
Next up is Swing Latino.

08:44.700 --> 08:47.400
__

08:50.900 --> 08:56.306
__

08:59.900 --> 09:02.733
__

09:02.733 --> 09:04.889
__

09:06.477 --> 09:07.477
__

09:08.282 --> 09:10.551
__

09:10.624 --> 09:12.594
__

09:12.794 --> 09:14.890
__

09:14.970 --> 09:19.142
__

09:23.367 --> 09:26.467
__

09:28.020 --> 09:29.801
__

09:29.901 --> 09:32.677
__

09:33.302 --> 09:35.668
__

09:46.300 --> 09:48.333
Swing Latino!

09:49.833 --> 09:51.467
This is so funny,

09:51.467 --> 09:52.833
seeing you guys so calm

09:52.833 --> 09:54.300
'cause I've only ever seen you like...

09:56.400 --> 09:58.033
And then the footwork,
and then the footwork.

09:58.033 --> 09:59.333
So, like, what is it? It goes...

10:06.933 --> 10:09.167
I think Swing Latino have a bit of an edge

10:09.167 --> 10:11.033
because they have that energy

10:11.033 --> 10:12.767
that is really hard to compete with.

10:12.767 --> 10:15.767
So, for your first performance,
I get to pick a song for you.

10:15.767 --> 10:17.667
I want you guys to have a good song

10:17.667 --> 10:20.667
'cause it's popular,
but also it has that Latin Feel.

10:20.667 --> 10:21.967
Gloria Estefan "Conga."

10:24.000 --> 10:26.267
It has great moments to the song that

10:26.267 --> 10:28.600
will really, like,
complement their style of dancing.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.033
What I wanna see this performance is

10:31.033 --> 10:32.700
the best Swing Latino.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.500
The footwork, the speed,

10:34.500 --> 10:36.400
the synchronicity, the tricks,

10:36.400 --> 10:38.333
the wow moments.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.533
But this one, I wanna see
it all come together.

10:40.533 --> 10:42.500
- Yes!
- Swing Latino, you got this!

10:46.233 --> 10:47.967
Steven, what happened to you?

10:49.101 --> 10:51.467
Friday, they broke my ankle.

10:51.467 --> 10:53.800
- So you broke your ankle?
- Yeah.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.600
For me, is so sad.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.033
I know, it's heartbreaking for you,

10:57.033 --> 10:58.867
but your group is rallying around you,

10:58.867 --> 11:01.033
and they're gonna go out there
and do an incredible job.

11:01.033 --> 11:03.333
- Yes.
- Good luck, guys.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.000
Go show 'em what you got!

11:07.800 --> 11:11.623
__

11:13.967 --> 11:20.206
__

11:24.500 --> 11:26.733
__

11:30.133 --> 11:31.800
They never disappoint with the wardrobe.

12:24.133 --> 12:25.800
- Whoa!
- Hey!

12:58.733 --> 12:59.933
Oh!

13:23.433 --> 13:24.933
You guys are easily

13:24.933 --> 13:26.800
the biggest risk takers in the competition

13:26.800 --> 13:30.067
'cause you're not risking
artistic integrity or style.

13:30.067 --> 13:32.000
You're risking your lives. Like...

13:32.000 --> 13:34.367
What--what was this moment when you went up

13:34.367 --> 13:35.833
and then you went back this way

13:35.833 --> 13:38.733
and then you tossed her acro-- like, what?

13:38.733 --> 13:40.833
One false move, and it's like,

13:40.833 --> 13:43.067
"Ah, man, you remember Swing Latino? Damn."

13:43.067 --> 13:44.267
You know what I mean?

13:44.267 --> 13:47.333
Like, it's that serious. I'm saying.

13:47.333 --> 13:48.833
I am always at the edge of my seat.

13:48.833 --> 13:51.533
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'm--I'm making weird noises

13:51.533 --> 13:52.284
when I'm watching you.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.467
For me, it wasn't as clean

13:55.467 --> 13:57.233
as I would have liked to
have seen in certain places,

13:57.233 --> 13:59.367
but again, your energy, your passion,

13:59.367 --> 14:02.867
your commitment, is just infectious.

14:02.867 --> 14:04.367
It's just beautiful and wonderful

14:04.367 --> 14:06.400
and a joy to watch. I love you guys.

14:08.833 --> 14:11.433
I feel the unity. I feel the joy.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.833
I feel the happiness that
you have for being here,

14:13.833 --> 14:16.000
- and it's a beautiful thing.
- Yes, yes.

14:17.833 --> 14:19.133
- Are we locking?
- Yes.

14:19.133 --> 14:20.333
We're gonna lock in our scores.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.500
Lock in our scores, all right.

14:33.867 --> 14:35.267
All right, let's see your round one score.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.367
91.7.

14:57.633 --> 14:59.800
Okay, let's look where that puts you

14:59.800 --> 15:02.767
on the round one leaderboard.

15:02.767 --> 15:03.867
It's close.

15:06.467 --> 15:08.233
That puts you in second place.

15:08.233 --> 15:10.333
You still have one more performance to go.

15:10.333 --> 15:11.867
Anything can happen.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.267
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

15:13.267 --> 15:15.100
- Good luck, guys.
- Let's go!

15:16.700 --> 15:21.287
__

15:29.700 --> 15:32.033
Next to take
the stage, it's Eva Igo.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.367
I can't believe that I'm
in the "World" final.

15:36.367 --> 15:38.800
When I first stepped on the
"World of Dance" stage,

15:38.800 --> 15:41.733
it was really scary.

15:41.733 --> 15:44.500
I didn't even think that I'd
make it through the first round.

15:47.267 --> 15:50.133
We only brought a week's worth of clothes.

15:50.133 --> 15:53.833
But then she just goes
out there and nails it.

15:56.794 --> 15:57.167
Whoa.

15:57.167 --> 15:58.024
And I was, like, shocked.

16:00.033 --> 16:01.367
I didn't think that the judges

16:01.367 --> 16:04.100
would like my dance as much as they do.

16:04.100 --> 16:06.967
Seeing Eva pursuing her dream here

16:06.967 --> 16:08.967
is the most joyous thing I've ever seen.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.167
She's in heaven.

16:13.100 --> 16:15.900
My score for last round was 96,7

16:15.900 --> 16:17.667
I'm one point behind Les Twins.

16:17.667 --> 16:21.000
That's really crazy because
Les Twins are amazing.

16:23.433 --> 16:24.867
In the beginning, I thought that I would

16:24.867 --> 16:26.333
learn how to dance better,

16:26.333 --> 16:28.433
but I've learned a lot more than that.

16:28.433 --> 16:30.333
I just believe in myself more.

16:32.267 --> 16:34.433
I think she's gonna leave here

16:34.433 --> 16:36.267
knowing there's a big world out there,

16:36.267 --> 16:39.833
and she's good enough to-- to do it.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.800
- Hello.
- How are you?

16:42.800 --> 16:44.567
- Good, how are you?
- Hugs, hugs, hugs, hugs.

16:45.845 --> 16:46.267
Good to see you. Good to see you.

16:46.267 --> 16:47.633
You too.

16:47.633 --> 16:49.400
So, in your last performance,

16:49.400 --> 16:51.200
you showed a power and a confidence

16:51.200 --> 16:52.700
that--that we hadn't seen before...

16:53.707 --> 16:54.367
And I feel like

16:54.367 --> 16:56.867
if you just continue to show a
little bit of vulnerability,

16:56.867 --> 16:58.133
a little bit of emotion,

16:58.133 --> 16:59.767
with this--this energy

16:59.767 --> 17:02.033
and this--this animal that's inside.

17:02.033 --> 17:04.267
The song that I have selected for you is

17:04.267 --> 17:05.700
"In the Air Tonight."

17:05.700 --> 17:08.200
I have a reason that I've picked the song,

17:08.200 --> 17:10.633
but I want you to find a
reason to dance to the song

17:10.633 --> 17:12.867
'cause it's gonna make
whatever movement you put to it

17:12.867 --> 17:14.933
- that much more purposeful.
- My biggest challenge

17:14.933 --> 17:17.200
with this song is it's a
little bit out of my style,

17:17.200 --> 17:18.532
so I really have to push myself.

17:18.532 --> 17:20.767
And if anybody can pull it off,

17:20.767 --> 17:22.067
the beautiful monster can,

17:22.067 --> 17:23.767
I think.

17:23.767 --> 17:25.733
There's this beast in Eva

17:25.733 --> 17:28.867
that I really, really feel
like Les Twins and Swing Latino

17:28.867 --> 17:30.633
should be absolutely afraid of.

17:35.133 --> 17:37.867
I really want the judges to
see a different side of me,

17:37.867 --> 17:40.600
and really feel my story.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.667
I think I can do it.

17:45.667 --> 17:49.200
Next up to take the stage is Eva Igo.

17:52.667 --> 17:54.600
Let's go, baby!

17:57.431 --> 17:58.000
Whoo!

17:58.000 --> 17:59.600
Whoo-hoo!

18:36.467 --> 18:37.700
Whoo!

19:48.200 --> 19:51.200
Eva, to see you evolve
through this competition,

19:51.200 --> 19:53.067
it's so magical to watch.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.267
For me, you're a complete package.

19:55.267 --> 19:57.100
You're a complete package.

19:59.100 --> 20:01.633
I told you to take this song,
give it your own meaning.

20:01.633 --> 20:04.233
What meaning did you
give to the--to the song?

20:04.233 --> 20:07.233
Well, before this competition,

20:07.233 --> 20:11.233
some things have happened to me,
so I kind of closed off.

20:11.233 --> 20:17.067
So this coldness is, like,
me freezing a wall.

20:17.067 --> 20:18.933
Until I came here,

20:18.933 --> 20:23.400
and I started to be able to
trust myself again, so...

20:23.400 --> 20:25.333
You knocked that wall down.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.267
You took every note I gave you,

20:29.267 --> 20:31.567
and you did it beautifully.

20:31.567 --> 20:32.900
Great job. Great job.

20:35.533 --> 20:38.067
There's a maturity that's happened to you

20:38.067 --> 20:39.467
from the beginning to now.

20:39.467 --> 20:41.933
You have to tap into
something inside yourself

20:41.933 --> 20:44.267
to be "an artist," and you did that.

20:44.267 --> 20:45.700
To me, that was your journey.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.833
No matter what happens beyond this,

20:47.833 --> 20:49.767
if you win tonight,
if you don't win tonight,

20:49.767 --> 20:52.100
to me, you have won.

20:52.100 --> 20:53.867
Thank you so much.

20:53.867 --> 20:55.833
- All right, let's lock 'em in.
- Yeah.

20:55.833 --> 20:57.200
Let's do it.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.433
To me, the choreography was lacking in it.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.233
- Me too.
- Do yo--yeah.

21:12.567 --> 21:15.100
Let's see your round
one score, Eva.

21:30.976 --> 21:31.439
Great, 91!

21:31.600 --> 21:32.962
Oh, boy. She'll go first?

21:35.400 --> 21:36.633
- One more round.
- Round one.

21:36.633 --> 21:38.133
One more round.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.033
- Anything can happen.
- Close.

21:42.033 --> 21:43.867
- It's close.
- Dude, it's so close.

21:50.333 --> 21:52.867
All three acts dance one last time.

21:52.867 --> 21:54.467
Oh!

21:55.633 --> 21:57.233
It's a fitting final

21:57.233 --> 21:59.533
for a million dollars and for the title,

21:59.533 --> 22:01.433
the best in the world.

22:11.167 --> 22:14.300
Okay, now the acts are going to dance again

22:14.300 --> 22:16.200
and their average score for both dances

22:16.200 --> 22:18.000
will decide the winner.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.833
First up is the act in third
place after round one,

22:21.833 --> 22:22.967
Eva Igo.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.333
One last performance

22:24.333 --> 22:25.967
for $1 million.

22:25.967 --> 22:27.600
Let's do it!

22:30.600 --> 22:32.067
Got another round. Got another round.

22:32.067 --> 22:33.300
- Yeah, got another round.
- And it's close enough

22:33.300 --> 22:34.900
to where it can be turned around.

22:34.900 --> 22:36.400
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

22:36.400 --> 22:39.300
- So, Eva, you look amazing.
- Thank you.

22:39.300 --> 22:40.600
Second performance.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.367
Okay, so tell me what's
going through your head

22:42.367 --> 22:43.700
as you prepare for this.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.533
Um, I really just need to do it for me.

22:45.533 --> 22:46.767
Yeah. Go out there

22:46.767 --> 22:48.933
and do the best that you can do.

22:48.933 --> 22:50.200
Whoo!

22:50.200 --> 22:51.333
- Thank you.
- All right, Eva.

22:51.333 --> 22:53.267
- I love you.
- Love you too.

22:55.100 --> 22:56.533
Really sad that this is the last time

22:56.533 --> 22:58.033
that I'm gonna be going out on the stage.

22:58.033 --> 23:00.133
For sure. "World of Dance"

23:00.133 --> 23:02.533
has definitely changed my life already.

23:02.533 --> 23:04.600
This is a dream that I
don't wanna wake up from.

23:04.600 --> 23:05.494
It's just been so amazing.

23:07.133 --> 23:08.967
Whoo!

23:51.098 --> 23:51.771
Whoo!

24:55.100 --> 24:55.806
Ah!

24:57.600 --> 24:59.367
Come on now!

25:00.533 --> 25:02.867
That's how you do it.

25:02.867 --> 25:05.533
Okay, that is more like it now.

25:05.533 --> 25:07.067
In your first performance,

25:07.067 --> 25:09.667
for me, the choreography
was a little bit lacking.

25:09.667 --> 25:12.467
This was the total
opposite of that.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.633
The choreography was amazing.

25:14.633 --> 25:17.233
It had concept. It had story.

25:17.233 --> 25:19.167
It's like they're
taking shots at you

25:19.167 --> 25:20.567
through this whole competition.

25:20.567 --> 25:22.033
You're like, "No, I'm not dead yet.

25:22.033 --> 25:23.267
I'm here. I'm alive. I'm still breathing."

25:23.267 --> 25:24.767
Yeah, "I'm still breathing."

25:24.767 --> 25:26.333
"I'm in it."

25:26.333 --> 25:29.133
We saw moves that you hadn't done before.

25:29.133 --> 25:30.933
- Beautiful performance, baby.
- Thank you.

25:30.933 --> 25:32.967
- Beautiful.
- Oh, my gosh!

25:32.967 --> 25:34.767
Way to come back!

25:34.767 --> 25:36.533
You are exceptional, Eva,

25:36.533 --> 25:39.267
and you are a star.

25:39.267 --> 25:40.033
Thank you.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.133
Let me gather 'cause you give
me proud papa feels all day.

25:44.133 --> 25:44.596
Hold on.

25:45.833 --> 25:48.467
There's a ferociousness

25:48.467 --> 25:50.833
- in you when you dance.
- Thank you.

25:50.833 --> 25:52.433
It's like the second you start moving,

25:52.433 --> 25:54.667
you turn into this little beautiful monster.

25:54.667 --> 25:56.300
You're the only soloist.

25:56.300 --> 25:57.667
There's not a lot of props.

25:57.667 --> 25:58.967
There's not a lot of
stuff up there with you.

25:58.967 --> 26:00.667
You've, like, embraced, "You know what?

26:00.667 --> 26:02.267
"I'm up here by myself.

26:02.267 --> 26:04.267
and I'ma rock this by myself."

26:04.267 --> 26:05.567
Like, I love that.

26:05.567 --> 26:07.200
I love that.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.333
I mean, how--how has this
experience been for you?

26:11.333 --> 26:13.667
Well...

26:13.667 --> 26:16.700
especially since this
experience is so amazing,

26:16.700 --> 26:19.133
my last time on the stage is sad,

26:19.133 --> 26:21.633
but it just felt really good to...

26:21.633 --> 26:22.967
- Scream?
- Yeah.

26:23.856 --> 26:24.733
Let me ask you a question.

26:24.733 --> 26:27.733
If you won the million dollars,
what--what happens?

26:27.733 --> 26:29.000
- What do you do?
- What would you do with it?

26:29.000 --> 26:31.767
Well, dance is expensive,

26:31.767 --> 26:32.364
and...

26:33.233 --> 26:36.333
My families been having a hard
time the past couple years,

26:36.333 --> 26:39.300
so I guess it's kind of hard

26:39.300 --> 26:43.400
- to pay for it all, so...
- It's all right.

26:43.400 --> 26:46.167
I would probably pay for my own dancing.

26:46.167 --> 26:47.533
Aww.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.633
Is your family here?

26:53.633 --> 26:55.500
Um, my brother, sister, and mom.

26:55.500 --> 26:56.833
They should be 100% proud of you.

26:56.833 --> 26:57.933
- So proud.
- As you should be

26:57.933 --> 26:59.733
proud of yourself.

26:59.733 --> 27:01.400
When I was 14, if somebody asked me

27:01.400 --> 27:02.867
what I was gonna do with a million dollars,

27:02.867 --> 27:06.033
it would have been,
"Pizza and I'ma buy a unicorn,

27:06.033 --> 27:07.533
and I'ma..."

27:07.533 --> 27:09.733
You are thinking about
somebody other than yourself.

27:09.733 --> 27:11.533
That speaks volumes to your character.

27:12.700 --> 27:15.133
We're gonna score you now.

27:21.967 --> 27:23.300
Let's see your score.

27:34.300 --> 27:35.500
That's crazy!

27:39.633 --> 27:41.133
Good. That's good, babe.

27:41.133 --> 27:42.733
Thank you.

27:42.733 --> 27:45.767
Eva!

27:48.467 --> 27:50.000
Whoo!

27:51.533 --> 27:53.867
The scores from both
performances have been combined

27:53.867 --> 27:56.367
Let's see your average score.

27:57.833 --> 27:59.400
You're obviously at the
top of the leaderboard.

27:59.400 --> 28:00.633
You went first in the second round.

28:00.633 --> 28:01.833
So we'll see what happens.

28:01.833 --> 28:03.167
It's a pretty good score though, baby.

28:03.167 --> 28:04.733
Thank you.

28:11.067 --> 28:12.933
- Eva!
- Fantastic.

28:22.133 --> 28:23.367
Okay, um...

28:23.367 --> 28:24.633
here we are, second performance,

28:24.633 --> 28:26.100
We saved the best for last.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.800
Light everyone up like you always do.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.133
I love you guys.

28:31.267 --> 28:35.126
__

28:38.167 --> 28:40.900
__

28:43.567 --> 28:46.033
__

28:50.100 --> 28:51.700
Let's go!

28:53.700 --> 28:55.667
I swear, their outfits are always the best.

29:15.067 --> 29:16.233
Whoo!

29:56.033 --> 29:57.367
Yes!

30:24.667 --> 30:26.333
- Whoa!
- Oh!

30:39.300 --> 30:40.600
Yeah!

30:40.600 --> 30:41.933
Whoo!

30:41.933 --> 30:43.433
You're so lovely.

30:44.867 --> 30:46.967
Swing Latino!

30:49.967 --> 30:52.333
You guys are the most energetic group.

30:52.333 --> 30:54.633
You guys are the loudest group.

30:54.633 --> 30:57.000
Every single Swing Latino
performance is always,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.100
"Oh! Ooh! Oh, my God! Oh!"

30:59.700 --> 31:01.433
It's nerve-wrecking and entertaining

31:01.533 --> 31:02.548
at the same time.

31:03.867 --> 31:05.400
I really loved this performance

31:05.400 --> 31:06.733
more than the first one.

31:06.733 --> 31:08.233
I thought you guys did great on this one.

31:08.233 --> 31:09.933
It was very clean.

31:09.933 --> 31:11.567
You guys were so challenged this week,

31:11.567 --> 31:15.167
and I think, like, to come out
and do a performance like that

31:15.167 --> 31:17.633
with the difficulty level that that has

31:17.633 --> 31:19.067
and to be as clean as you were,

31:19.067 --> 31:20.967
was really the best you could do.

31:20.967 --> 31:23.200
And I-I loved it. I loved this one.

31:23.200 --> 31:24.800
This one was-- this one was one I like.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.300
This one--this is the one. I agree.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.633
I asked you guys to be a
little bit more clean.

31:29.633 --> 31:32.100
That was precision. So together.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.267
The concept, the use of the props.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.967
The way you actually stacked
them on top of each other,

31:35.967 --> 31:37.600
which by the way, that's not secure.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.433
Like, that--those could have,
like, fallen off at any time,

31:39.433 --> 31:40.733
so--you just keep adding the danger.

31:40.733 --> 31:43.167
Adding the element of just risking it all

31:43.167 --> 31:44.600
and you guys do that every single time

31:44.600 --> 31:46.500
- you're on that dance floor.
- We dance because

31:46.500 --> 31:48.100
this is our life.

31:48.100 --> 31:50.667
This is all we have.

31:50.667 --> 31:53.700
All with-- with this beautiful art,

31:53.700 --> 31:55.467
and...I don't--

31:55.467 --> 31:57.600
I-I want to speak English,

31:57.600 --> 31:59.567
- but I-I am--
- That's okay.

31:59.567 --> 32:02.567
You say--you say more than enough

32:02.567 --> 32:05.200
with your passion and your dancing.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.600
'Cause that is universal.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.700
It's so wonderful.

32:08.700 --> 32:10.167
- Should we lock in the scores?
- Yes.

32:10.167 --> 32:11.533
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

32:16.067 --> 32:18.300
Okay, Eva, it's time to go get the scores.

32:18.300 --> 32:19.600
- Okay.
- You ready?

32:19.600 --> 32:21.333
- Yeah.
- Let's do this.

32:34.533 --> 32:37.067
Are we locking in?

32:37.067 --> 32:38.367
Yup.

32:39.767 --> 32:40.967
Just to let you know,

32:40.967 --> 32:42.833
we don't know what's gonna happen.

32:42.833 --> 32:44.467
- We really don't.
- I know, it's close.

32:44.467 --> 32:46.333
Yeah. It's gotta be.

32:46.333 --> 32:51.533
Eva Igo, your average score
after two performances is 93.7.

32:51.533 --> 32:54.833
Swing Latino, you need a
final combined average

32:54.833 --> 32:57.833
of more than 93.7 or higher

32:57.833 --> 32:59.633
to stay in the competition.

32:59.633 --> 33:01.433
Let's see your final score.

33:18.167 --> 33:20.533
Eva Igo, congratulations.

33:20.533 --> 33:24.000
You are still with the
chance of winning $1 million.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.667
Wow.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.000
Oh, man, you guys,

33:34.000 --> 33:35.900
you brought so much passion

33:35.900 --> 33:39.367
and so much life to this show.

33:39.367 --> 33:42.500
It was an absolute privilege to watch you.

33:43.767 --> 33:47.755

33:47.955 --> 33:50.945

33:51.045 --> 33:52.800

33:56.700 --> 33:59.565
__

33:59.665 --> 34:00.665
__

34:15.167 --> 34:19.433
Eva Igo, it's all down
to this next performance.

34:19.433 --> 34:20.967
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

34:36.632 --> 34:38.766
The final performance.

34:38.766 --> 34:41.900
Who will be crowned
"World of Dance" champion

34:41.900 --> 34:44.367
and take home $1 million?

34:44.367 --> 34:46.400
We're gonna lock in our scores

34:46.400 --> 34:49.167
for the last time.

35:04.367 --> 35:06.767
If they ace this performance,
you think it's enough to win?

35:06.767 --> 35:09.167
- They absolutely can.
- They can.

35:09.167 --> 35:13.733
At this point, will you
crack under the pressure?

35:13.733 --> 35:14.867
Yeah.

35:21.267 --> 35:22.500
It's time. It's time.

35:22.500 --> 35:23.833
We don't want to be the number two.

35:23.833 --> 35:26.633
I can't wait to show what we're about,

35:26.633 --> 35:28.433
but I'm scared to at the same time.

35:30.533 --> 35:32.900
Hey!

35:32.900 --> 35:35.667
I called my mom and she was super positive.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.500
She make us realize what we are here for.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.340

35:39.599 --> 35:41.334
__

35:41.598 --> 35:42.723
__

35:44.133 --> 35:46.633
My mama, she's been the mom
and dad for both of us.

35:46.633 --> 35:47.833
Yeah, I wanna make her proud.

35:47.833 --> 35:50.900

35:51.301 --> 35:52.521
__

35:52.968 --> 35:53.868
__

35:55.467 --> 35:57.467
Talking to my mom, it means so much.

35:57.467 --> 35:59.367
This money is for the whole family.

35:59.367 --> 36:02.133
We will make sure that mom has a vacation

36:02.133 --> 36:03.567
for the rest of her life.

36:03.567 --> 36:05.633
One last performance in this competition.

36:05.633 --> 36:07.000
- What are you gonna do?
- You will see.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.900
- Kill it, kill it, kill it.
- Can't wait.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.567
- You know what we're about.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

36:10.567 --> 36:12.000
- let's do it.
- Yeah, let's do it.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.067
All right.

36:20.767 --> 36:22.833
Tonight, it is so important

36:22.833 --> 36:25.933
for Les Twins to win this competition.

36:25.933 --> 36:27.400
We cannot disappoint all these people.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.000
for a million dollars.

36:32.200 --> 36:34.133
And I wanna get the 99.

36:34.133 --> 36:35.667
- I wanna get the 99.
- I wanna get the 100.

36:35.667 --> 36:37.500
No--the 100, no. I wanna get the 99.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.200
Yes, I don't do the final
without getting 100.

36:46.967 --> 36:48.400
Whoo!

36:50.400 --> 36:51.533
Oh, my goodness.

36:51.533 --> 36:52.733
Whew.

37:12.233 --> 37:13.433
Oh!

37:56.800 --> 37:58.167
Whoa!

38:48.300 --> 38:50.067
Les Twins, Les Twins, Les Twins!

38:50.067 --> 38:53.167
You guys took a very, very familiar song--

38:53.167 --> 38:54.833
ooh, that was dangerous.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.067
That was dangerous.

38:57.067 --> 38:59.533
To come out here--
'cause everybody knows that song.

38:59.533 --> 39:01.100
Everybody knows that video.

39:01.100 --> 39:02.500
But you took it and you Les Twin'd it.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.800
Everything you guys do
just becomes your own...

39:04.800 --> 39:06.700
- Thank you.
- And this was no exception.

39:06.700 --> 39:08.333
Exactly, exactly.

39:09.900 --> 39:12.833
You guys--when you hit things,
it's so strong.

39:12.833 --> 39:14.533
It makes you, like--we feel it.
You know what I mean?

39:14.533 --> 39:16.000
When you hit it, it goes, boom,

39:16.000 --> 39:17.733
and it hits us in the chest.
I mean, we feel that.

39:17.733 --> 39:20.267
There's definitely something
about you that's undeniable.

39:20.267 --> 39:24.233
You create an invisible energy
that we somehow can see.

39:26.433 --> 39:28.667
You're like oil and vinegar.

39:28.667 --> 39:30.367
You know what I mean? Like, you don't mix,

39:30.367 --> 39:32.200
- but your perfect together...
- Yeah, we don't match.

39:32.200 --> 39:35.100
and it's been such a pleasure watching you.

39:35.100 --> 39:36.967
This particular
performance was great.

39:36.967 --> 39:40.433
When you guys came out and
you were in silhouette,

39:40.433 --> 39:41.933
and the way you were moving,

39:41.933 --> 39:44.400
it was so powerful.

39:44.400 --> 39:46.267
You did Les Twins.

39:48.800 --> 39:52.933
Eva came out and honestly smashed.

39:52.933 --> 39:55.167
She just did so amazing.

39:55.167 --> 39:57.667
You guys came out with
the same killer instinct,

39:57.667 --> 40:01.167
It's a fitting final
for a million dollars

40:01.167 --> 40:03.600
and for the title of best in the world.

40:03.600 --> 40:07.500
All right, guys,
we're gonna lock in our scores.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.306
For the last time.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.933
Okay, Eva, it's time to go on stage.

40:15.933 --> 40:17.767
Come on.

40:23.433 --> 40:26.500
- It's hard.
- It's tough.

40:30.933 --> 40:34.100
The judges have
locked their scores.

40:34.100 --> 40:36.333
Let's hear it for your finalists.

and $1 million.

40:51.433 --> 40:54.233
Les Twins, you need a final combined average

40:54.233 --> 40:58.367
of more than 93.7 to win.

40:58.367 --> 41:01.133

41:41.300 --> 41:43.833
Tell us what this means to you right now.

41:43.833 --> 41:46.233
This competition was
hard from the beginning.

41:46.233 --> 41:47.600
We thank you, baby, for going hard on us,

41:47.600 --> 41:48.833
'cause you surprised--

41:48.833 --> 41:49.900
Well, she almost took it from you.

41:49.900 --> 41:51.133
- Don't make--
- Oh, I know.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.100
Give it up one more time

41:53.100 --> 41:55.067
for your winner, Les Twins.
