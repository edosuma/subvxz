- Quiet, young man.

this hearing as a fishing expedition.

01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:48.627
Their supposition that the-- My client...

conversation with Mr. Clifford...

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:54.674

circumstantial evidence.

this child willfully deceived us.

A set of fingerprints on a Cadillac
is hardly willful deceit.

We can show the child's fingerprints
on the suicide hose and on the gun itself.

We feel the child must testify for
his own good in order to exonerate himself.

Mr. Fink, are you attempting to implicate
this child in Clifford's suicide?

01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:26.164
No, we are not. Currently, we are alleging
only obstruction of justice.

01:16:26.374 --> 01:16:30.043
Now, involvement in a suicide
could constitute juvenile delinquency.

01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:32.587
This child could be removed
from his mother's care.

occurred in Louisiana...

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

01:53:23.589 --> 01:53:25.298
You can't come with us, can you?

01:53:26.967 --> 01:53:31.929
When you enter the witness-protection
program, you have to sever all ties.

01:53:34.850 --> 01:53:36.809
I'll never see you again, will I?

01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:39.061
No.

01:53:41.815 --> 01:53:43.691
Look, you wanna...?

01:53:44.359 --> 01:53:46.486
You wanna take care of my compass,
for me, heh?

01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:54.160
That way,
you'll never lose your way again.

01:54:05.130 --> 01:54:07.298
I love you, Reggie.

01:54:08.592 --> 01:54:11.677
I know, sweet boy, I love you too.

01:54:13.347 --> 01:54:15.181
You better go with your mama.

01:54:16.767 --> 01:54:18.434
Okay?

01:54:26.193 --> 01:54:28.027
I'll call you.

01:54:28.737 --> 01:54:30.738
[CHUCKLES]

01:54:35.202 --> 01:54:36.827
Oh.

01:54:37.579 --> 01:54:40.998
The body is behind Romey Clifford's house,
in his boathouse.

01:54:41.208 --> 01:54:43.042
1214 East Brookline.

01:54:43.252 --> 01:54:45.336
Oh, my.

01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:48.381
You did very well, Ms. Love.

01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:51.217
Reggie. Thank you, Roy.

01:54:51.385 --> 01:54:53.135
Oh, you forgot one thing.

01:54:53.345 --> 01:54:56.597
You should have demanded immunity
for your illegal actions.

01:54:56.765 --> 01:54:58.808
Tsk.

01:55:02.187 --> 01:55:04.522
Oh, an eye for an eye.

01:55:04.731 --> 01:55:06.649
Exodus, 21:24.

01:55:06.858 --> 01:55:10.861
Let me tell you something, when I get to be
governor of Louisiana, do you want a job?

01:55:11.029 --> 01:55:12.071
[CHUCKLES]

01:55:12.239 --> 01:55:15.074
- I got one, thank you.
MAN: Showtime, Roy.

01:55:15.242 --> 01:55:16.492
Mm.

01:55:18.328 --> 01:55:19.370
Thank you, Reggie.

01:55:20.497 --> 01:55:21.956
Thank Mark.

01:55:30.465 --> 01:55:31.591
Hey.

01:55:34.094 --> 01:55:36.804
Y'all come over here and gather round,
if you will, please.

01:55:37.014 --> 01:55:40.016
REPORTER 1: Come on, come on, come on.
- We have a--

01:55:40.225 --> 01:55:44.186
After what I must say has been
an exhaustive investigation on our part...

01:55:44.396 --> 01:55:46.647
...we are able to make
the solemn announcement...

01:55:46.857 --> 01:55:50.151
...that we have recovered the body
of Senator Boyd Boyette.

01:56:16.803 --> 01:56:18.179
HOOSER:
He's quite a kid.

01:56:18.388 --> 01:56:21.390
REGGIE: Don't tell him he's a kid,
he'll just get real pissed off.

01:56:21.558 --> 01:56:22.850
