03:11.233 --> 03:16.240
Well, here we are!
You're Tony and you're Tia!

03:16.407 --> 03:18.493
- Ma'am.
- Hello, Mrs Grindley.

03:18.577 --> 03:20.662
Such fine-looking children!

03:20.745 --> 03:22.832
I know you're anxious
to see your room,

03:22.915 --> 03:25.210
but first, we have some forms
to fill out,

03:25.294 --> 03:28.464
then we'll join the others
for dinner, all right?

03:28.631 --> 03:32.094
Tia, what a pretty case!

03:37.643 --> 03:39.730
Well...

03:44.653 --> 03:46.781
It ain't nothing
writing out those entry forms.

03:46.865 --> 03:49.744
Wait till she lays one of those
enlightened punishments on you!

03:49.827 --> 03:51.954
"And after you watch
the five o'clock news

03:52.038 --> 03:55.084
you can write
a 500-word composition!" Brother!

03:56.711 --> 03:59.882
Tony, what should I put
after "sports"?

04:00.049 --> 04:03.220
Put "spectator".

04:04.513 --> 04:06.600
Dumb pen's out of ink!

04:06.767 --> 04:10.230
I'm finished. You can use mine.

04:12.107 --> 04:15.237
Hey, I lost one just like this
when I was coming into this barn!

04:17.029 --> 04:20.619
- Tia's had that since Christmas!
- Sure she has!

04:22.663 --> 04:24.290
Give it back!

04:26.418 --> 04:28.045
Take it!

04:30.590 --> 04:35.430
Now, children, that wasn't
so difficult, was it?

04:35.597 --> 04:37.684
No, ma'am.

04:37.850 --> 04:42.273
Now, Truck, I want you
to wait for me in my office.

04:42.439 --> 04:45.026
We'll read this together.

04:50.701 --> 04:54.373
I keep forgetting
what it feels like to sit down!

04:55.833 --> 04:58.003
I know how both of you must feel.

04:58.169 --> 05:01.966
Your foster parents
are the only parents you remember,

05:02.133 --> 05:06.347
and now that they've passed away,
you're just a little bit scared.

05:06.514 --> 05:10.686
- We loved them very much.
- Yes, ma'am. We miss them.

05:10.853 --> 05:14.984
You only remember
your adoptive name, "Malone"?

05:15.151 --> 05:20.867
Well, Tia was around three and I was
five when the Malones adopted us.

05:22.745 --> 05:28.294
Did either of you ever receive
a birthday card from a relative?

05:28.461 --> 05:32.257
Perhaps a phone call at Christmas?

05:33.008 --> 05:34.844
Maybe you've forgotten.

05:35.470 --> 05:40.310
Often, the most trivial thing
is important. Tia...

05:40.477 --> 05:43.231
Were you remembering something?

05:44.106 --> 05:48.071
No, Mrs Grindley. I'm sorry.

05:48.238 --> 05:52.368
There's nothing
to be sorry about, dear.

06:12.937 --> 06:15.023
You're out, Truck.

06:27.916 --> 06:32.005
Nobody can jump that high, Malone.
You stood on something!

06:49.028 --> 06:52.449
You're just trying to rip me off.
I was safe at third.

06:52.617 --> 06:57.956
There's something funny about this,
and I'm gonna teach you a lesson!

06:58.123 --> 06:59.667
<i>Tony!</i>

07:14.729 --> 07:16.815
Cut it out, will ya?

07:45.187 --> 07:47.274
<i>Tony, why did you do that?</i>

07:47.440 --> 07:51.153
<i>You don't think we're gonna</i>
<i>get away with it, do you?</i>

07:58.664 --> 08:00.750
<i>You see?</i>

08:04.839 --> 08:09.012
<i>Tony, you promised me</i>
<i>and I promised you</i>

08:09.178 --> 08:15.478
<i>we wouldn't do the kind of stuff</i>
<i>you did with Truck.</i>

08:15.645 --> 08:20.736
<i>Remember when we thought</i>
<i>it was all funny, like a game?</i>

08:20.902 --> 08:26.035
<i>And all the other kids thought we</i>
<i>were freaks or witches.</i>

08:26.201 --> 08:28.287
I know, Tia.

08:28.455 --> 08:33.001
We lost all our friends until
we quit doing the spooky stuff.

08:33.169 --> 08:36.840
- <i>You should have let Truck hit you.</i>
- Are you kidding?

08:37.008 --> 08:39.217
He's much bigger than me!

08:39.385 --> 08:42.347
<i>Then you should have made it</i>
<i>look like he won.</i>

08:43.475 --> 08:44.934
I suppose.

08:46.520 --> 08:50.817
<i>Tony, do you hear the dogs?</i>

08:53.571 --> 08:56.283
No. How far?

08:59.455 --> 09:04.044
<i>About 20 miles. Big dogs.</i>
<i>Six or seven.</i>

09:05.922 --> 09:08.676
Yeah, I can hear them now.

09:11.596 --> 09:16.603
<i>That's awful far, even for us.</i>
<i>Why are we hearing them, Tony?</i>

09:18.897 --> 09:23.529
I think it means
we're gonna see 'em some day.

09:42.471 --> 09:46.727
If the bus is any later, we'll miss
the beginning of the picture.

09:46.893 --> 09:50.357
- Yeah!
- I'll see what's keeping them.

09:52.818 --> 09:55.155
Want to see something really neat?

09:55.322 --> 09:59.202
- That's my star case, Truck.
- And you're his sister!

10:00.620 --> 10:03.416
<i>Tony, please. Not another fight!</i>

10:03.583 --> 10:07.630
It's your star case, Tia.
He might smash it.

10:08.298 --> 10:10.843
Give it back to Tia now!

10:11.010 --> 10:15.265
- I'll fight you with one hand!
- I'll fight you with none!

10:20.898 --> 10:23.276
The bus is here!

10:39.215 --> 10:41.343
Nice going, Winkie!

10:42.761 --> 10:46.850
Tony and Tia!
What's taking you? Come on!

10:47.017 --> 10:49.521
Hurry up!

11:06.877 --> 11:10.507
<i>Tony, across the street!</i>

11:12.301 --> 11:15.889
The big car? What about it?

11:16.056 --> 11:18.810
Something's going to happen to it.

11:18.977 --> 11:23.316
There's a man.
He mustn't get into that car!

11:23.483 --> 11:26.612
There he is!

11:28.531 --> 11:30.075
Come on!

11:35.249 --> 11:39.421
- Sir, don't get in that car!
- It's no joke, sir!

11:39.588 --> 11:42.341
My sister, she gets these feelings.

11:42.508 --> 11:45.889
- You mustn't get in the car.
- Please, sir!

11:47.390 --> 11:51.688
Children! You know the rules
about leaving the group!

11:51.855 --> 11:56.527
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- That's all right.

12:03.329 --> 12:07.459
I've changed my mind.
I'd like to take a walk.

12:07.626 --> 12:11.172
- Pick me up by the park.
- Yes, sir.

12:26.235 --> 12:28.947
- Are you all right?!
- Yes, sir.

12:48.223 --> 12:51.602
The moon is moving into Aries.

12:51.769 --> 12:55.107
Friday, it will near
the middle of the transit.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.652
The bottom line, Mr Meikeljohn!

12:57.819 --> 13:01.031
The bottom line, Mr Bolt,

13:01.198 --> 13:06.914
shows considerable indications
of some advance towards your goals.

13:07.081 --> 13:09.668
House guru, do you concur?

13:09.835 --> 13:13.340
There are profound vibrations,
Mr Bolt.

13:13.507 --> 13:15.593
Are there indeed?

13:15.760 --> 13:19.766
Vibrations. My moon in Aries.

13:19.932 --> 13:24.689
Mysterious words and phrases haven't
added one cent to my fortune!

13:24.856 --> 13:30.071
Wealth is like flesh,
it has to be nurtured and coddled!

13:32.282 --> 13:35.411
Ah, Mr Deranian!

13:36.455 --> 13:38.040
I'm sorry, Mr Bolt,

13:38.207 --> 13:41.962
but when you've heard my report,
you will understand.

13:42.129 --> 13:44.966
I have found
what you're looking for.

13:56.690 --> 13:58.360
Wait here a minute.

14:31.195 --> 14:33.532
I haven't had a chance to thank you.

14:33.699 --> 14:35.785
Was the man in front all right?

14:35.952 --> 14:41.168
Yes, but you knew he would be or you
would have kept him out of the car.

14:43.170 --> 14:48.385
I suppose this sort of thing happens
to you all the time, young lady?

14:48.552 --> 14:51.431
Knowing about things
before they happen?

14:55.145 --> 14:57.439
The lunch bell. We have to go.

14:58.691 --> 15:01.737
Excuse me.
Those two children that just left.

15:01.904 --> 15:04.616
I've been trying
to think of their names.

15:04.783 --> 15:09.164
Tony Malone and his sister, Tia.
A couple of weirdos!

15:44.920 --> 15:47.841
Suppose somebody else walked in?

15:53.515 --> 15:57.479
Everybody knocks.
Pine Woods rules!

15:57.646 --> 15:59.523
Look.

16:01.025 --> 16:05.699
Maybe it happened when Winkie
knocked it out of Truck's hands.

16:05.866 --> 16:07.784
Can you fix it?

16:10.663 --> 16:12.416
It's a map!

16:12.583 --> 16:17.756
- Stony Creek?
- Misty Valley?

16:34.279 --> 16:35.989
It's funny, Tia.

16:36.156 --> 16:39.536
Every once in a while
you get that look on your face,

16:39.703 --> 16:42.207
like you're remembering something.

16:42.373 --> 16:46.837
I kind of do,
but then I forget again.

16:48.465 --> 16:53.305
It's not someplace big
like a state or a country,

16:53.472 --> 16:58.478
but more like a road map -
I just don't know where.

16:58.645 --> 17:04.027
When I can figure out
where this place is, we'll go there.

17:06.405 --> 17:09.409
Tony, what were you drawing?

17:09.576 --> 17:11.663
It's where those dogs are.

17:13.874 --> 17:17.170
- They're barking now.
- I know. I heard them,

17:17.337 --> 17:20.590
and then I began
to visualise this castle.

17:20.758 --> 17:24.931
Tony, you can only visualise places
we know something about!

17:26.891 --> 17:29.980
Or places we're gonna be at.

17:31.898 --> 17:34.735
I was drawing a place
we're going to.

17:37.948 --> 17:42.538
Soon, Tony. We're going there soon
and I'm afraid!

18:07.071 --> 18:09.575
Since the Malones lived in a village,

18:09.742 --> 18:13.330
it was easy to find people
who knew the two children.

18:13.497 --> 18:18.086
These insights,
these sixth sense incidents -

18:18.253 --> 18:22.842
the postman, the school teacher,
the woman who lost her parakeet -

18:23.009 --> 18:28.225
how do I know these are not figments
of your very fine imagination?

18:28.391 --> 18:30.478
I have sworn affidavits.

18:30.645 --> 18:35.693
People lie very easily. The very
young can deceive the very wise.

18:35.860 --> 18:38.364
I'm not lying.

18:39.323 --> 18:43.454
If I'm in any way disappointed
in this Tony and Tia,

18:43.621 --> 18:45.790
you are through here, Deranian.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.043
Yes.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.296
I understand.

18:50.463 --> 18:55.971
Then, bring them here. You say they
have no family - well, now they do.

18:56.137 --> 18:59.058
You are their uncle,
do you understand?

18:59.225 --> 19:01.770
Perfectly.

19:01.937 --> 19:06.777
Alter records. Forge documents.
Provide proper papers.

19:06.944 --> 19:11.157
I will back you
with every means at my disposal.

19:11.325 --> 19:13.870
Just bring me the children!

19:14.913 --> 19:17.417
There's no question,

19:17.584 --> 19:21.297
considering these documents
your uncle has produced,

19:21.463 --> 19:23.550
that he has custody of you.

19:23.717 --> 19:26.512
The judge signed those papers
just today.

19:26.679 --> 19:28.765
- Mr Deranian...
- Uncle Lucas.

19:28.932 --> 19:32.187
- Better get used to it.
- Uncle Lucas,

19:32.353 --> 19:36.525
did you tell Mrs Grindley
about the first time we saw you?

19:36.693 --> 19:41.449
Yes, he did. The day the tow truck
ran into your uncle's car.

19:41.616 --> 19:44.661
That was a lucky day for all of us!

19:44.828 --> 19:49.251
You see, Tia, you look so much
like Mr Deranian's sister

19:49.418 --> 19:52.964
that he's convinced
you both are her children.

19:54.008 --> 19:59.014
My sister, your mother,
died six years ago.

20:00.266 --> 20:02.353
If you have any doubts,

20:02.520 --> 20:06.983
I can show you these documents
that prove he is your Uncle Lucas.

20:07.150 --> 20:09.695
I won't have
to leave Winkie, will I?

20:09.862 --> 20:13.493
He's very smart, and he knows
how to deal with dogs.

20:13.660 --> 20:15.203
Did I mention dogs?

20:19.125 --> 20:22.880
Well, thank you very much,
Mrs Grindley.

20:23.047 --> 20:28.429
I'll see you out, Mr Deranian.
Children, don't forget your coats.

20:30.391 --> 20:33.603
Do you have any feelings
about this Mr Deranian?

20:33.770 --> 20:36.190
Only that he isn't our uncle.

20:36.357 --> 20:38.986
Must we leave, Tony?

20:39.152 --> 20:44.660
That's what these papers mean.
We haven't got a choice.

21:05.313 --> 21:09.526
It's all right, Lorko. I'm just
bringing through the children.

21:21.209 --> 21:25.131
I'm sorry, sir,
but I'm allergic to cats.

21:25.340 --> 21:27.593
Let us through.

21:46.619 --> 21:49.080
<i>Those are the dogs we heard.</i>

21:56.674 --> 22:01.389
- <i>There's the mansion.</i>
- <i>It's just the way you drew it!</i>

22:09.441 --> 22:13.071
Uncle Lucas, what's "Ex-anthus"?

22:13.280 --> 22:18.787
It's "Zanthus", Tony.
Mr Bolt calls his house "Xanthus".

22:18.996 --> 22:21.291
Who's Mr Bolt?

22:21.499 --> 22:26.464
He's my employer. And your host.

22:28.341 --> 22:32.973
I have spacious apartments here,
and thanks to Mr Bolt's generosity,

22:33.181 --> 22:36.102
they've been enlarged
and redecorated

22:36.269 --> 22:39.440
to accommodate the two of you.

22:46.783 --> 22:50.038
So this is your long-lost family!

22:50.204 --> 22:53.792
You've a very beautiful niece,
Deranian,

22:53.959 --> 22:56.463
and a most attractive nephew.

22:56.671 --> 22:58.799
You are Tony and you are Tia!

23:02.847 --> 23:04.891
Here!

23:05.893 --> 23:09.814
Our favourite flavours!
Vanilla and strawberry!

23:10.023 --> 23:12.360
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

23:12.568 --> 23:14.613
After that long drive,

23:14.821 --> 23:19.954
I'm sure you'd like to see
your new quarters. Come with me.

23:33.471 --> 23:35.724
Wow! It's beautiful!

23:38.603 --> 23:42.359
- Isn't it cute?
- I must be dreaming!

23:42.567 --> 23:44.611
Tony, look at that!

23:49.326 --> 23:51.579
Hey, look!

23:51.788 --> 23:54.041
Oh, wow!

23:57.421 --> 24:00.091
Look at these dolls
and stuffed animals!

24:04.973 --> 24:07.225
Hey, Tony!

24:12.441 --> 24:15.695
- When this is completed...
- There's more?

24:15.863 --> 24:20.827
Yes! We haven't had time to install
the carousel or the gymnasium.

24:21.036 --> 24:23.956
The tennis court
is being resurfaced.

24:24.165 --> 24:26.543
Your riding lessons start tomorrow.

24:26.752 --> 24:30.341
- Oh, wow!
- We love horses!

24:30.549 --> 24:32.802
I forgot!

24:38.935 --> 24:42.357
Winkie's private quarters.

24:48.865 --> 24:51.452
I think he likes it!

24:53.622 --> 24:55.667
They're really great.

24:55.875 --> 24:59.797
- You still have school work.
- Your tutors arrive next week.

25:00.005 --> 25:02.467
Where are the others?

25:03.718 --> 25:06.472
- Other kids?
- Neighbours, I mean.

25:06.640 --> 25:10.853
There are no neighbours.
Look out of the window. Go on.

25:11.062 --> 25:13.899
Look as far as you can see.

25:22.619 --> 25:25.707
Mr Bolt owns everything in sight.

25:29.754 --> 25:31.715
Well, I could see the sky.

25:39.142 --> 25:42.855
I saddled him myself
because this is your first time out.

25:43.063 --> 25:47.194
Always mount a horse
on his left side because...

25:47.403 --> 25:50.782
Tia, you'd better pay attention
or you'll be sorry.

25:50.991 --> 25:52.869
That horse over there...

25:53.036 --> 25:57.709
Thunderhead's never been broke.
I don't envy anyone who tries!

25:58.960 --> 26:02.465
It should be ladies first,
but show Tia how easy it is.

26:02.673 --> 26:06.804
A little filly the size
of your sister can get scared.

26:12.979 --> 26:17.611
<i>Thunderhead, that's not nice!</i>
<i>My name's Tia.</i>

26:17.778 --> 26:21.449
<i>I want to be your friend,</i>
<i>all right, Thunderhead?</i>

26:25.204 --> 26:29.335
Tia, stay away from him!
Hold on!

26:37.513 --> 26:40.183
<i>Good boy!</i>

26:52.741 --> 26:56.121
I've never seen this in all my life!

27:24.534 --> 27:27.622
Tia! Come here.

27:39.847 --> 27:43.518
Why don't you try it
without your harmonica?

27:43.727 --> 27:46.397
I forget how. Come to think of it,

27:46.564 --> 27:50.945
you can do a lot of things I can't,
like working locks,

27:51.112 --> 27:54.784
and the way you can talk to me
without moving your mouth.

27:54.992 --> 27:57.204
Maybe it's because you're a girl.

30:10.551 --> 30:13.721
That's the most incredible thing
I've ever seen!

30:13.931 --> 30:17.519
Thank you. I'm having
more hidden cameras installed,

30:17.727 --> 30:20.189
and as soon as I have
enough evidence,

30:20.398 --> 30:22.943
I'll show the tapes to the children.

30:23.152 --> 30:25.822
Good. If that doesn't put them
on my team,

30:26.030 --> 30:29.785
we'll have to resort
to cruder methods.

30:41.801 --> 30:43.846
Tia?

30:45.265 --> 30:47.309
Tia!

30:52.149 --> 30:55.069
Tia, what's the matter?

30:56.530 --> 30:59.034
Oh, everything. And nothing.

30:59.242 --> 31:04.207
I mean, maybe it's because we've
gotten everything we've ever wanted,

31:04.415 --> 31:06.293
more, even.

31:07.921 --> 31:09.798
I don't know.

31:12.218 --> 31:15.932
It doesn't leave us anything
to wish for, is that it?

31:16.140 --> 31:18.184
I think so.

31:18.392 --> 31:22.941
Tony, we've got to get out of here
before it's too late. Please!

31:24.192 --> 31:28.323
- What do you see?
- Mr Bolt, and he's mean.

31:28.532 --> 31:30.993
He's never going to let us go, Tony.

31:31.202 --> 31:36.292
You're not always right about things
like this, and I think this time...

31:36.501 --> 31:39.421
Well, this time...

31:42.551 --> 31:44.595
You're right.

31:53.232 --> 31:55.902
I've enjoyed this.

31:56.069 --> 32:00.616
Tony, Tia, we should arrange it
so that you dine with me more often!

32:00.825 --> 32:02.870
Thank you, Mr Bolt.

32:03.078 --> 32:06.416
There's fine, stimulating
conversation.

32:06.624 --> 32:09.796
However, let us dispense
with the kid gloves

32:09.963 --> 32:13.551
and admit that you're
two remarkable children!

32:13.759 --> 32:16.513
I really don't think you...

32:16.680 --> 32:20.727
I don't care what you think!
If these youngsters are psychic,

32:20.936 --> 32:23.481
they've begun to see
through us by now!

32:23.690 --> 32:25.484
Don't lay all...

32:25.650 --> 32:28.821
You have power! I've seen it,

32:28.988 --> 32:33.453
though I don't mean to ridicule
those gifts of yours as others do.

32:33.661 --> 32:38.043
- I revere them. Do you believe me?
- What power do you mean?

32:38.210 --> 32:41.839
<i>He knows, Tony.</i>
<i>He knows all about us!</i>

32:42.048 --> 32:44.009
What do you mean, Mr Bolt?

32:44.218 --> 32:47.639
What you did with Thunderhead
and the marionettes,

32:47.847 --> 32:51.185
and the dozens of things
I've seen on my TV console.

32:51.393 --> 32:56.734
I want to be able to understand
these powers, but I need your help.

32:56.943 --> 32:59.363
You can make it possible!

32:59.571 --> 33:04.620
You could walk across a field and
tell where there's oil beneath it!

33:04.829 --> 33:07.833
You could foresee revolution,
disaster!

33:07.999 --> 33:11.462
Please, Mr Bolt, you're too excited.

33:11.672 --> 33:14.133
You're going to make yourself sick!

33:14.342 --> 33:16.386
You should go right to bed, sir.

33:19.348 --> 33:21.393
Yes.

33:22.644 --> 33:25.106
Yes, I will.

33:25.314 --> 33:30.488
Anything. Anything in this world
you ask me for, I'll bring you.

33:30.697 --> 33:32.908
Just never leave me!

33:33.075 --> 33:36.246
Not another word. Into bed.

33:36.454 --> 33:42.045
Uncle Lucas, you look like you
could use some extra sleep yourself.

34:00.029 --> 34:04.159
You heard what he said. He wants
to learn all the things we know!

34:04.367 --> 34:09.081
We couldn't teach him,
even if we wanted to!

34:10.333 --> 34:13.087
We don't know
why we do all these things.

34:13.254 --> 34:15.466
We don't know how it all started.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.444
Tony, we've got to get out of here,
please!

34:30.612 --> 34:35.868
But to what, Tia? Where do we go?
Not to mention how?

34:36.954 --> 34:38.998
The map.

34:39.206 --> 34:41.543
- <i>Mr Bolt.</i>
- Listen!

34:41.752 --> 34:44.255
<i>Don't lay all your cards</i>
<i>on the table!</i>

34:44.463 --> 34:48.761
<i>They're cunning. I don't</i>
<i>know the full extent of their power.</i>

34:48.928 --> 34:50.973
Here they could escape,

34:51.181 --> 34:54.768
but the chalet is an island
in the sea of blinding snow.

34:54.978 --> 34:58.232
They'll never escape from there!

34:58.440 --> 35:01.111
Nutty as a fruitcake!

35:02.071 --> 35:04.825
You see? We have to get out of here!

35:05.033 --> 35:09.163
I know, but there's that high fence
and the guards and...

35:09.372 --> 35:11.417
Children...

35:13.128 --> 35:18.092
...finish your ice-creams
and I'll show you to your bedrooms.

35:27.689 --> 35:29.566
<i>He's coming.</i>

36:07.743 --> 36:09.788
Come on!

36:44.501 --> 36:47.046
So far so good.

36:48.632 --> 36:50.342
Come on!

37:37.573 --> 37:40.911
Those dogs will ruin all my plans!

37:43.539 --> 37:45.876
What do you mean it's too late?!

37:53.512 --> 37:55.681
- Now!
- <i>Dogs, stay!</i>

37:55.889 --> 37:58.351
<i>Stay!</i>

37:59.478 --> 38:03.692
<i>Good dogs! There's some</i>
<i>very bad men after us.</i>

38:05.236 --> 38:06.779
<i>Go get 'em!</i>

38:16.126 --> 38:18.587
There's still the main gate.

38:18.795 --> 38:22.718
They're not gonna stop chasing us.
Call Thunderhead.

38:22.926 --> 38:25.930
<i>Thunderhead,</i>
<i>remember what I told you?</i>

38:30.102 --> 38:32.606
<i>We're at the gate now.</i>

38:45.040 --> 38:48.920
- Lorko's on that lever!
- I'll help!

39:26.428 --> 39:29.976
Winkie! Winkie!

39:38.153 --> 39:40.531
Find them! I don't care how!

39:40.740 --> 39:45.288
Chase 'em on a magic carpet if you
have to, but I want those kids back!

39:52.840 --> 39:55.593
They rode out of here!

39:58.472 --> 40:00.517
They're quite a challenge.

40:00.726 --> 40:05.273
I will not rest until I get those
children back and neither will you!

40:05.481 --> 40:10.030
I'm a vengeful man, Deranian.
I don't make idle threats!

40:12.074 --> 40:14.536
Find them!

40:30.766 --> 40:33.144
You'll be all right here, big fella.

40:33.353 --> 40:35.397
Thank you, Thunderhead.

40:42.783 --> 40:45.452
<i>We'll miss you, Thunderhead.</i>

40:53.254 --> 40:58.220
Those sirens are for us.
We gotta keep moving. Come on!

41:01.933 --> 41:04.395
They're getting closer.

41:12.656 --> 41:16.160
Looks like you're taking
a mighty long trip, friend.

41:16.369 --> 41:19.791
Yeah, I figured to drive
all over the United States.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.753
Well, a covered wagon
pulling out of St Joe

41:22.962 --> 41:27.342
didn't take near as much supplies
as you got here, Mr O'Day!

41:27.509 --> 41:30.597
You're sure
one well-informed man, aren't ya?

41:30.806 --> 41:34.519
Now, could you hand me that
without straining yourself,

41:34.728 --> 41:39.109
or are you tuckered out from
sticking your nose in my affairs?

41:48.955 --> 41:53.170
We're looking for two children.
A boy and a girl. Runaways.

41:53.337 --> 41:56.674
If I saw 'em,
I'd let 'em keep running,

41:56.883 --> 42:00.721
as long as they're going
opposite to where I'm headed!

43:26.045 --> 43:30.801
What do you know about that?
A drifter, huh?

43:32.596 --> 43:35.892
You're a friendly little fella,
aren't ya?

43:36.100 --> 43:38.854
I got some canned tuna for you!

43:47.991 --> 43:51.537
Hey! What are you doing here
in my...?

43:53.207 --> 43:57.254
When I was loading supplies,
they were looking for two kids.

43:57.463 --> 44:00.300
A boy and a girl! You two!

44:00.509 --> 44:04.889
Let's get one thing straight
here and now! I ain't no bus line,

44:05.056 --> 44:07.393
and I ain't partial to hitchhikers!

44:07.601 --> 44:10.063
And I don't like kids!

44:10.271 --> 44:14.820
And I'm a mean, impatient, selfish
man, so get on your way! Out!

44:17.865 --> 44:20.244
Come on! Out! On your way!

44:25.041 --> 44:30.132
Wait a minute. It ain't right
for no human being to go hungry.

44:30.340 --> 44:33.720
I'll make you some breakfast
before you go.

44:34.722 --> 44:36.265
Don't get any ideas.

44:36.432 --> 44:40.896
I got no patience with kids,
especially runaways!

44:41.105 --> 44:45.236
It's just the opposite, sir!
We're trying to find where home is.

44:46.946 --> 44:49.700
Excuse me,
but did you see a black cat?

44:52.245 --> 44:54.290
Oh, yeah. Yours, huh?

44:55.791 --> 44:58.086
Well, she's around somewhere.

44:59.338 --> 45:02.676
Go on down to the water
and clean yourselves off.

45:11.521 --> 45:15.485
He just likes to bellow a lot.
He's not really mean.

45:15.693 --> 45:18.155
You got to be kidding!

45:36.472 --> 45:38.516
Sorry, sir, no sign of'em.

45:38.725 --> 45:42.855
A grocer loaded up a camper
around the time the kids got away.

45:43.064 --> 45:46.693
- They may have hidden in there.
- Did anyone spot a camper?

45:46.902 --> 45:48.696
I let one go through.

45:49.614 --> 45:55.205
The driver was alone, a big fella,
older guy, zip-up jacket, fair hair?

45:55.414 --> 45:56.958
That's the one.

45:57.125 --> 46:01.506
He was in a recreation vehicle,
heading north on Highway L38.

46:01.673 --> 46:04.135
All right. North on Highway L38.

46:04.343 --> 46:09.266
Now get out an APB
on an RV heading north on L38.

46:13.981 --> 46:18.027
You see, Mr O'Day, we don't expect
to find our real parents,

46:18.237 --> 46:23.577
- but maybe someone who knew them.
- And can explain things to us.

46:23.785 --> 46:27.624
And we gotta make sure Mr Bolt
and Deranian don't catch us.

46:27.833 --> 46:32.298
Well, maybe that's the truth
and maybe it ain't,

46:32.465 --> 46:35.050
but I'm not gonna complicate things.

46:35.260 --> 46:37.471
I'm gonna be on my way.

46:43.646 --> 46:48.986
What did I do with my keys?
I know I had 'em in my pock...

46:56.705 --> 47:01.253
- I must have lost 'em out there.
- You should have a spare key, sir.

47:02.338 --> 47:06.552
I know that, young lady.
I am not a losing man,

47:06.719 --> 47:09.181
at least not till you showed up!

47:09.389 --> 47:12.310
Do you know a place
called Stony Creek?

47:12.477 --> 47:17.609
Stony Creek?
Yes, there's good fishing there.

47:19.319 --> 47:21.531
If we get the motor started...

47:21.739 --> 47:26.204
and clean up the back section,
will you take us there?

47:26.371 --> 47:30.251
Oh, so that's it?

47:30.459 --> 47:35.716
You're nothing but a conniving pair
of undersized land pirates!

47:35.925 --> 47:39.513
You swiped my keys
to make sure you'd get a ride!

47:39.721 --> 47:41.766
Give me my keys.

47:41.975 --> 47:47.107
Sir, the engine will start now.

48:13.767 --> 48:15.812
All right.

48:16.689 --> 48:21.653
You go back there and clean up.
Make everything ship-shape.

48:21.862 --> 48:24.783
I'll see that you get to Stony Creek.

48:40.513 --> 48:43.183
You just remembered something!

48:43.391 --> 48:46.229
It has something to do
with the ocean.

48:46.395 --> 48:51.069
Come on! Go on back. Clean up.
Let's get on the way!

49:36.797 --> 49:39.050
Sure is a nice day!

49:39.259 --> 49:42.346
Not with the prices
you're charging for gas!

49:51.233 --> 49:54.779
Keep still. This fella's
acting mighty peculiar.

49:54.988 --> 49:58.075
- Nobody could know we're with you.
- Maybe not.

49:58.285 --> 50:02.332
You'll be out of my hair by tomorrow
once we get to Stony Creek.

50:02.499 --> 50:04.919
- How much?
- Ten dollars even.

50:05.127 --> 50:07.380
Ten. There you are.

50:32.873 --> 50:35.794
Mr O'Day,
I think you bought too much.

50:35.961 --> 50:40.634
Winkie can't drink four quarts
of milk between now and tomorrow!

50:40.843 --> 50:45.056
If you weren't joshing me about
Aristotle Bolt being after you,

50:45.265 --> 50:48.854
we might be together
longer than we planned.

50:49.062 --> 50:52.400
He's a powerful man, too power...

50:56.989 --> 50:59.033
Motorcycle cop!

51:02.872 --> 51:04.916
That attendant at the gas station!

51:05.125 --> 51:07.420
You won't get in trouble, will you?

51:07.628 --> 51:09.965
It's not me he's after!

52:29.739 --> 52:34.371
On second thoughts,
I might not drop you off too soon.

52:34.538 --> 52:38.501
I might get an honest day's work
out of you! Take you fishing!

52:39.962 --> 52:45.720
Deep sea fishing. Pit you
against half a ton of blue marlin!

52:56.693 --> 52:59.614
Tia, what are you thinking about?

52:59.780 --> 53:03.452
About before.
It had to do with fishing.

53:03.660 --> 53:08.125
- With Daddy Malone?
- No...

53:08.334 --> 53:11.004
But we were on a boat.

53:11.171 --> 53:13.633
A trawler...

53:13.841 --> 53:16.303
...like Daddy Malone had.

53:16.511 --> 53:19.515
That's all I remember.

53:20.516 --> 53:24.648
Every lawman in the county
is probably looking for this camper.

53:32.951 --> 53:36.372
Here you are. Hot chocolate.

53:36.580 --> 53:38.792
Thank you.

53:41.170 --> 53:43.547
What's that you have there?

53:43.715 --> 53:45.259
My star case.

53:45.425 --> 53:48.763
Look at what we found
in the secret compartment.

53:48.930 --> 53:51.767
- You see where Stony Creek is?
- Yes.

53:51.934 --> 53:56.440
There's a path that leads
away from it up into some mountains.

53:56.607 --> 54:01.281
We think maybe that's where we come
from, somewhere in those mountains.

54:02.782 --> 54:08.665
No, I don't think it was that way.
Not exactly.

54:28.400 --> 54:31.321
- There was an accident.
- Well, go on!

54:31.487 --> 54:34.659
I... It's gone.

54:34.826 --> 54:38.581
- What kind of an accident?
- I don't know.

54:38.748 --> 54:41.668
- In a car?
- No.

54:41.835 --> 54:47.301
On the ocean. And someone
helped me save my star case.

54:47.468 --> 54:51.390
- Well, who?
- Whoever put the map in the case

54:51.557 --> 54:56.480
hid it so well, it took you
all these years to find it.

54:56.647 --> 55:00.402
That's right, Mr O'Day.
Why would anybody do that?

55:00.611 --> 55:04.032
I don't know. Maybe...

55:04.199 --> 55:08.705
Maybe waiting for you to get
old enough to do something about it.

55:08.872 --> 55:13.753
- Like now!
- Very peculiar, huh?

55:14.964 --> 55:17.342
I wonder...

55:17.509 --> 55:21.555
I wonder how I'd handle you kids
if you were mine?

55:25.395 --> 55:27.605
Maybe that's why I never married!

55:27.814 --> 55:31.903
But, Mr O'Day, you were married.

55:34.657 --> 55:36.242
What?

55:36.409 --> 55:41.791
A long time ago. She was so pretty!
And you had a little house.

55:42.584 --> 55:45.547
Yeah! I can see it!

55:46.256 --> 55:49.844
It was white, with yellow shutters.

55:50.011 --> 55:53.056
There was a big elm branch
over the whole roof.

55:53.223 --> 55:57.146
Tony knows about people.
He can see places they've been.

56:00.859 --> 56:02.945
What else?

56:03.112 --> 56:07.535
Your wife died a few months after
you were married. You were so sad.

56:07.702 --> 56:14.044
You swore you'd never give your love
to another woman or to anyone,

56:14.210 --> 56:16.756
and you never have.

56:22.013 --> 56:24.098
I'm sorry, Mr O'Day.

56:24.265 --> 56:28.897
The name's Jason! You know so much
about me, you might as well use it.

56:29.064 --> 56:30.858
Jason, you understand?

56:31.025 --> 56:33.070
I like the name Jason.

56:33.236 --> 56:36.908
We didn't mean
to make you sad, Jason.

56:48.548 --> 56:51.844
Well, come on!
Are we gonna dawdle here all night?

56:52.011 --> 56:54.974
Let's clean up here
and get some sack time in.

56:55.140 --> 56:59.480
We'll pull out of here
a couple of hours before sun-up.

57:05.321 --> 57:08.617
They're going to Longview,
do you understand?

57:08.784 --> 57:13.541
Mr Deranian, $ 1,000 reward
speaks mighty clear in these parts.

57:13.708 --> 57:15.919
You can count on me!

57:16.086 --> 57:19.841
- Yes, I'll do that, Sheriff.
- <i>It's been a pleasure!</i>

57:24.848 --> 57:26.934
A real pleasure!

57:45.459 --> 57:47.837
Ubermann! Over there.

58:19.505 --> 58:21.591
This time, no mistake.

59:43.660 --> 59:47.792
Now, listen close.
We're coming into Longview.

59:47.958 --> 59:52.381
My brother's house is two miles
outside of town, up the north road.

59:52.547 --> 59:54.926
His name is Hiram O'Day.

59:56.929 --> 01:00:00.350
There's a car behind us, Jason!

01:00:00.517 --> 01:00:05.232
In Longview, I'll find a place to
make a fast turn and a quick stop.

01:00:05.399 --> 01:00:09.487
You two jump out the side door
and hide. You got that?

01:00:09.654 --> 01:00:11.990
Sure, Jason. You watch Winkie.

01:00:12.157 --> 01:00:14.244
Yeah, I'll keep going.

01:00:14.411 --> 01:00:17.998
If luck is with us,
Deranian and his pal will follow me.

01:00:18.207 --> 01:00:20.252
You wait till he gets past.

01:00:20.419 --> 01:00:23.214
Then we'll head
for your brother's house.

01:00:23.381 --> 01:00:25.426
Hiram O'Day.

01:00:26.635 --> 01:00:28.221
Don't lose him.

01:01:18.790 --> 01:01:23.212
Well, now! Welcome to Longview!

01:01:35.187 --> 01:01:40.319
6.10 a.m. OK, let's have your names.

01:01:40.528 --> 01:01:43.740
- Tony Castaway.
- Tia Casta...

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:50.749
"Castaway"?
That's no name, it's a word.

01:01:50.958 --> 01:01:54.922
Your legal name is "Malone"
and don't kid me about that.

01:01:58.802 --> 01:02:02.682
I think I'll let you see
what lying to the law will get ya!

01:02:08.231 --> 01:02:10.317
Come on.

01:02:23.085 --> 01:02:25.129
In you go.

01:02:52.458 --> 01:02:57.423
Tony, I've been thinking about
why we said our name was "Castaway".

01:02:57.632 --> 01:03:01.930
It might have something to do
with us speaking another language

01:03:02.138 --> 01:03:04.182
when the Malones took us in.

01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:05.893
Another language?

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:08.271
That's why we didn't talk.

01:03:09.648 --> 01:03:11.901
You mean, we had to learn English?

01:03:13.152 --> 01:03:15.697
We spoke a funny kind of language.

01:03:16.407 --> 01:03:19.829
- Uncle Bene spoke it to us.
- Who's Uncle Bene?

01:03:33.347 --> 01:03:39.564
- I think he died. Drowned.
- What did he look like?

01:03:41.274 --> 01:03:44.194
He had white hair...

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:46.739
<i>We don't want no panic.</i>

01:03:46.948 --> 01:03:50.537
<i>Well, Mr Deranian's on his way.</i>

01:03:50.704 --> 01:03:53.374
<i>I'll be home if you need me.</i>

01:03:53.541 --> 01:03:56.420
We've got to think of something fast!

01:04:04.055 --> 01:04:06.976
Hey, Tony, look!

01:04:14.486 --> 01:04:18.700
Tony, that bear looks so unhappy!

01:04:23.331 --> 01:04:25.793
Tia, we need my harmonica.

01:04:51.285 --> 01:04:53.330
Now, open the cell door.

01:05:13.649 --> 01:05:17.321
When I get the star case,
you run to the edge of the woods.

01:05:17.488 --> 01:05:19.365
After I've freed the bear.

01:05:19.574 --> 01:05:22.244
How can we get any place
with a big bear?!

01:05:22.411 --> 01:05:26.625
- He's counting on me!
- But this is an emergency!

01:05:26.834 --> 01:05:31.841
We have to get past the sheriff.
Why don't you think about that?

01:07:24.744 --> 01:07:26.829
Get off me!

01:08:29.331 --> 01:08:34.296
I hope we don't have to pass a zoo
before we get where we're going!

01:08:39.511 --> 01:08:44.518
I know what I saw, and I say
there's only one explanation!

01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:48.733
Those two kids are witches
and they're from Witch Mountain!

01:08:51.152 --> 01:08:56.200
Arm yourselves
and divvy up into hunting groups!

01:08:56.367 --> 01:09:01.041
What you gonna do? Chase 'em
all the way to Witch Mountain?

01:09:01.957 --> 01:09:05.630
We'll stop 'em before they get there.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:11.596
Now, listen close and I'll give you
the areas to cover.

01:09:11.764 --> 01:09:15.060
Those look like hunting parties.

01:09:21.526 --> 01:09:26.450
They got away, but we know
what they are - evil itself!

01:09:26.617 --> 01:09:30.455
- We got to catch 'em!
- They're from Witch Mountain!

01:09:30.622 --> 01:09:32.959
We need more ammunition.

01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:35.712
We'll get 'em, Mr Deranian.

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:41.636
They've really got blood
in their eyes.

01:09:41.804 --> 01:09:45.393
There's no use trying
to reason with them now.

01:09:52.109 --> 01:09:56.156
Security. This is Deranian.

01:09:56.323 --> 01:10:01.956
I want a complete check
on a Jason O'Day.

01:10:14.515 --> 01:10:17.436
Tia, I know how you feel
about the bear,

01:10:17.603 --> 01:10:20.106
and I think he's real neat, too,

01:10:20.273 --> 01:10:23.319
but a lot of people
are gonna be looking for us,

01:10:23.485 --> 01:10:26.031
and he'll be safer on his own.

01:10:26.197 --> 01:10:30.329
Anyway, they might shoot him
just for the sport of it.

01:10:31.038 --> 01:10:34.584
Look! He'll be safe there
until tonight.

01:10:34.751 --> 01:10:39.299
- He can move on when it's dark.
- You're right. I'll talk to him.

01:10:39.466 --> 01:10:43.346
<i>You be a good bear</i>
<i>and wait in that cave.</i>

01:10:46.475 --> 01:10:49.187
<i>We don't want anything</i>
<i>to happen to you.</i>

01:10:54.569 --> 01:10:57.239
Tony, his feelings were hurt.

01:11:49.269 --> 01:11:52.148
Watch it!

01:12:04.331 --> 01:12:06.834
Jason!

01:12:08.085 --> 01:12:12.050
Hunters are everywhere!
They think you're witches!

01:12:12.216 --> 01:12:16.972
My brother ain't home, but I'll get
you some food and you can rest.

01:12:22.813 --> 01:12:29.323
There's a brother. Hiram O'Day. 244,
Cayhill, just north of Longview.

01:12:30.115 --> 01:12:33.411
We can be there in 15 minutes.

01:12:42.006 --> 01:12:46.596
I still can't figure out why we both
came up with a name like "Castaway".

01:12:46.763 --> 01:12:50.643
I noticed that you two
are very smart for your years.

01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:53.438
Do you know what a castaway is?

01:12:53.605 --> 01:12:58.737
Sure. It's like being shipwrecked
and left on a desert island.

01:13:00.532 --> 01:13:05.664
I just remembered. "Castaway" is
the name of someone we have to see.

01:13:05.831 --> 01:13:10.253
That's funny.
I just remembered the same thing!

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:13.549
Suppose you two are castaways?

01:13:13.716 --> 01:13:16.929
Then it would fit things
Tia's been remembering!

01:13:17.096 --> 01:13:21.601
- Uh-huh.
- We were in some kind of wreck.

01:13:21.768 --> 01:13:26.358
- And we were in the sea!
- You mean like a boat sinking?

01:13:26.525 --> 01:13:31.073
I guess, but if it was a boat,
I don't remember where it came from.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:36.456
We had an uncle. Uncle Bene.

01:13:36.622 --> 01:13:40.294
He kept us afloat
and then he drowned.

01:13:42.088 --> 01:13:45.968
For a long time, we didn't
understand anything anyone said.

01:13:46.135 --> 01:13:48.930
You must have come
from another country.

01:13:50.433 --> 01:13:54.980
We won't know everything till we get
to the mountains above Stony Creek.

01:13:55.147 --> 01:13:59.236
- Like it shows on the map.
- Witch Mountain.

01:14:00.946 --> 01:14:04.159
Hiram mentioned that place
to me in his letters.

01:14:04.326 --> 01:14:08.916
He said some strangers settled
there, they kept to themselves,

01:14:09.083 --> 01:14:12.045
and nobody ever knew
where they came from.

01:14:12.212 --> 01:14:15.007
You think they might be your people?

01:14:15.174 --> 01:14:17.010
They must be!

01:14:23.602 --> 01:14:29.235
Security. Have you notified Mr Bolt
of our destination? Then do so.

01:14:48.636 --> 01:14:51.056
We just heard from Mr Deranian, sir.

01:14:51.223 --> 01:14:55.396
He's on his way to a Mr Hiram
O'Day's cabin, north of Longview.

01:14:55.563 --> 01:14:58.191
Don't just sit here! Get going!

01:14:59.401 --> 01:15:04.867
When Hiram gets home, he's gonna
find his cupboard is bare!

01:15:18.052 --> 01:15:20.805
Come on. The camper's out the back.

01:15:21.765 --> 01:15:23.224
Tia!

01:15:23.391 --> 01:15:28.023
<i>Can you hear me?</i>
<i>We need another favour.</i>

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:30.193
- Come on!
- Tia!

01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:52.723
There's no way we can get by 'em
without their seeing us.

01:16:22.806 --> 01:16:28.731
I remember more. It wasn't just
Uncle Bene who died in the ocean.

01:16:28.897 --> 01:16:31.943
A lot of other people died, too.

01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:35.740
And those people
that live here in these mountains,

01:16:35.906 --> 01:16:40.038
all of us came from the same
country, but on different ships.

01:16:41.372 --> 01:16:46.421
You mean, yours sank
and the others made it to port?

01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:52.888
But, Tony, it wasn't a country.
It was a place!

01:16:54.223 --> 01:16:57.644
Yeah. A place
that isn't there any more!

01:16:58.729 --> 01:17:00.356
Castaways?

01:17:01.858 --> 01:17:05.405
That's why my people
call themselves that!

01:17:05.572 --> 01:17:08.826
And this was the emblem
for where we used to live!

01:17:10.495 --> 01:17:14.584
Two stars?
I don't know no place named that.

01:17:14.751 --> 01:17:18.005
- It wasn't called that.
- No...

01:17:18.172 --> 01:17:21.718
Two stars... because our world
had two suns!

01:17:21.885 --> 01:17:24.055
Double stars!

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:28.436
Another planet!
A whole other solar system!

01:17:30.773 --> 01:17:34.361
Then it wasn't a boat...

01:17:35.737 --> 01:17:37.615
...it was a spaceship.

01:17:40.202 --> 01:17:42.956
Our planet was dying.

01:17:43.123 --> 01:17:47.295
The only industry left was
the manufacturing of spaceships.

01:17:47.462 --> 01:17:49.131
Like ours.

01:17:49.297 --> 01:17:52.635
We had to find
another planet to live on.

01:17:52.802 --> 01:17:57.642
Then the other ships in your cluster
landed here in these mountains,

01:17:57.809 --> 01:18:01.606
and yours didn't make it?

01:18:01.773 --> 01:18:06.904
I think we might be the only ones
in our spaceship to have survived.

01:18:53.676 --> 01:18:56.180
We lost them again.

01:18:57.306 --> 01:19:01.562
We're going south on Highway 211.
Why don't you search the north?

01:19:20.547 --> 01:19:24.176
Not too many people around,
are there?

01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:27.264
"Misty Valley Cooperative"?

01:19:27.431 --> 01:19:29.350
This is it.

01:19:44.162 --> 01:19:47.207
Maybe they've gone out to lunch.

01:19:49.085 --> 01:19:51.714
We'll wait.

01:20:03.938 --> 01:20:08.487
Are you the Longview bunch
chasing after those two witch kids?

01:20:08.653 --> 01:20:12.533
That's right. I'm Cort.
Are you putting up the reward?

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:17.707
That's right,
except it's now $5,000.

01:20:18.917 --> 01:20:23.089
But there's a catch.
I want those two children alive.

01:20:23.256 --> 01:20:27.762
I don't care about the old man. They
were in a camper headed this way.

01:20:28.972 --> 01:20:32.685
- Sounds good, friend.
- Any idea where to look for them?

01:20:32.852 --> 01:20:38.527
Well, they're not around here.
Maybe the next town up the line?

01:20:40.279 --> 01:20:42.908
Stony Creek.

01:20:59.889 --> 01:21:04.145
Stony Creek?
We're changing course now.

01:21:13.741 --> 01:21:17.371
They've sure had time enough
for a lunch break.

01:21:22.545 --> 01:21:26.216
It has something to do
with the phone book!

01:21:36.355 --> 01:21:39.610
Let me have another look
at that map.

01:21:47.913 --> 01:21:50.416
<i>Misty Valley Cooperative.</i>

01:21:50.583 --> 01:21:54.505
I was calling the Castaway family
and I was wondering if...

01:21:54.671 --> 01:21:57.800
<i>Were you looking</i>
<i>for Mr Castaway?</i>

01:21:57.967 --> 01:21:59.929
Yes!

01:22:01.765 --> 01:22:04.310
Watch it! Here comes Deranian!

01:22:04.477 --> 01:22:06.939
- <i>Is this Tony?</i>
- Yes.

01:22:07.105 --> 01:22:09.692
- <i>Is Tia with you?</i>
- Yes. Who is this?

01:22:09.859 --> 01:22:13.697
<i>Thank the stars! We've been</i>
<i>searching for you for years!</i>

01:22:13.864 --> 01:22:16.701
<i>Listen carefully.</i>
<i>Everything must time out.</i>

01:22:16.868 --> 01:22:21.416
<i>Take the back door</i>
<i>and go to Mr O'Day's camper.</i>

01:22:32.139 --> 01:22:37.062
<i>Children, we want to make sure</i>
<i>Mr Deranian doesn't lose you.</i>

01:22:37.229 --> 01:22:40.693
<i>We have a plan that will stop them</i>
<i>pursuing you again.</i>

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:42.361
Come on!

01:22:44.781 --> 01:22:46.868
Everything's all right.

01:22:47.034 --> 01:22:50.330
You've got a funny idea
of what's all right!

01:22:52.041 --> 01:22:54.712
Maybe Bolt can spot
the RV from the helicopter.

01:22:57.047 --> 01:22:59.551
Men! Come on!

01:23:22.290 --> 01:23:26.755
We've got a fix on them, sir.
Robertson Canyon, headed north.

01:23:36.476 --> 01:23:41.733
How can he lose us in that monster
he's driving? Close in on them!

01:23:43.194 --> 01:23:45.697
He's not exactly crawling.

01:23:54.042 --> 01:23:56.671
They're getting closer, Tony!

01:24:44.819 --> 01:24:46.905
Good driving, Al!

01:24:47.071 --> 01:24:51.161
How did we wind up here?
Let's get out.

01:25:04.596 --> 01:25:06.473
<i>Very ingenious!</i>

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.270
<i>But remember we want Deranian</i>
<i>to see what's coming up.</i>

01:25:10.437 --> 01:25:12.481
I don't understand, sir.

01:25:12.648 --> 01:25:17.696
<i>We have something planned</i>
<i>that will convince Deranian and Bolt</i>

01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:20.992
<i>that you're both</i>
<i>out of their reach for ever.</i>

01:26:41.393 --> 01:26:45.858
Deranian, I've spotted a route
that will let you cut ahead of them.

01:26:46.025 --> 01:26:48.654
<i>It's the second turn on the left.</i>

01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:51.574
<i>I'll signal the others</i>
<i>not to follow you.</i>

01:26:51.741 --> 01:26:53.701
- <i>Repeat, not.</i>
- Understood.

01:28:36.257 --> 01:28:39.804
- I don't believe it!
- It's what you call levitation.

01:28:39.971 --> 01:28:44.352
That ain't what I call it!
You two got powers beyond belief!

01:28:44.519 --> 01:28:48.983
We're not doing this. This is
something too powerful for us to do.

01:28:49.149 --> 01:28:52.570
Somebody else is making this happen.

01:30:02.332 --> 01:30:05.795
That thing's flying upside down!

01:30:07.297 --> 01:30:09.384
That's impossible!

01:30:10.343 --> 01:30:13.472
That kind of vehicle
can't fly upside down.

01:30:13.639 --> 01:30:16.267
It's not supposed to fly at all!

01:30:27.783 --> 01:30:31.204
They're not upside down, WE are!

01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:24.902
The voice says
we should get out here and wait.

01:31:39.381 --> 01:31:42.468
We'll never forget you, Jason.

01:31:43.386 --> 01:31:45.972
Would you take care of Winkie?

01:31:46.139 --> 01:31:48.518
Oh, no, Tia. Winkie's your cat.

01:31:48.685 --> 01:31:52.564
It wouldn't be right for her
to be with anybody else.

01:31:52.731 --> 01:31:54.818
It would make us happy.

01:31:54.984 --> 01:31:58.030
It sure would,
and Winkie would like it, too.

01:31:59.241 --> 01:32:03.663
Maybe we ought to ask Winkie
how she feels about that.

01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:05.374
Winkie...

01:32:05.541 --> 01:32:10.589
...how do you feel about going
around with a crusty old man?

01:32:15.345 --> 01:32:18.099
Look...

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:20.728
...if you don't mind,

01:32:20.894 --> 01:32:25.234
I'd like to plan
on remembering you two...

01:32:26.152 --> 01:32:28.739
...as if you were my kids.

01:32:31.576 --> 01:32:34.079
The kids I never had.

01:32:51.936 --> 01:32:55.609
Uncle Bene!

01:32:59.697 --> 01:33:03.368
You all did so well!
Congratulations, Jason O'Day!

01:33:03.535 --> 01:33:07.083
You're a man of courage
and compassion.

01:33:07.249 --> 01:33:09.336
We thought you'd drowned.

01:33:09.503 --> 01:33:12.632
Well, if you know exactly
what to say to a shark,

01:33:12.799 --> 01:33:15.052
he can be very accommodating!

01:33:18.598 --> 01:33:21.602
Tia, you never forgot.

01:33:22.436 --> 01:33:24.523
You didn't lose the star case.

01:33:24.689 --> 01:33:27.068
We only found the map
a few days ago.

01:33:27.235 --> 01:33:31.365
I knew when you were old enough
to understand it, you'd find it.

01:33:32.575 --> 01:33:36.747
It's good to know that there are
earthmen such as you, Mr O'Day.

01:33:36.914 --> 01:33:41.796
If the stars are willing, perhaps
the other children who survived

01:33:41.963 --> 01:33:44.174
will find men equally as kind.

01:33:44.341 --> 01:33:49.223
- There are more?
- Yes. All with star cases and maps.

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:52.477
So far, only Tia and Tony
have found the way.

01:33:59.528 --> 01:34:02.574
Now that I know what to keep
my eyes peeled for,

01:34:02.741 --> 01:34:07.080
perhaps I could spot some
of these kids and bring them here.

01:34:09.834 --> 01:34:12.963
Deranian's car.

01:34:20.932 --> 01:34:25.439
I'll have to attend to Bolt's
helicopter. Stay and watch.

01:34:26.732 --> 01:34:30.487
You'll see how we came
into this world of yours!

01:35:22.933 --> 01:35:26.354
What?! Stop this thing!

01:35:45.088 --> 01:35:47.800
I'm all right!
Where are the children?

01:36:31.943 --> 01:36:36.699
I should have known there was more
than ESP with those two!

01:37:10.328 --> 01:37:13.541
Well, they're home now.
