Rolf Kessel from the SS.

01:05.914 --> 01:08.082
And this is one of my men.

01:08.083 --> 01:11.487
We found him in a ditch with
a kitchen knife in his back.

01:11.503 --> 01:13.910
Murdered by one of you.

01:14.089 --> 01:17.956
You see the German army retreating,
and it makes you feel hope.

01:18.635 --> 01:20.302
It should not.

01:20.303 --> 01:24.668
So who is responsible for this?

01:25.308 --> 01:27.751
You, priest.

01:34.109 --> 01:36.277
- What's your name?
- I'm Father Merrin.

01:36.278 --> 01:38.696
Father Merrin.
These people confess to you?

01:38.697 --> 01:41.365
- Yes.
- So point out the one who is responsible.

01:41.366 --> 01:43.617
No one here did this, lieutenant.

KESSEL:
Father, you must help me with this.

01:48.873 --> 01:51.542
- MERRIN: Oh, but how?
- Well, I need someone.

01:51.543 --> 01:53.544
Do you understand?

01:53.545 --> 01:56.922
Surely there is one among them
who beats his wife or his children.

01:56.923 --> 01:58.424
A thief, perhaps.

01:58.425 --> 02:01.510
Every town has someone it
can do without. Point him out.

There is no murderer here.

02:07.767 --> 02:09.810
I have good news for you.

02:09.811 --> 02:13.772
You are all innocent.
Your priest has told me so.

02:13.773 --> 02:17.067
The murderer is no doubt
lurking in the countryside...

02:17.068 --> 02:21.303
waiting to strike at the next
group of German soldiers.

02:21.656 --> 02:26.660

02:26.661 --> 02:30.623

demonstrate to this wretch...

02:30.624 --> 02:34.823
the responsibility he has incurred.

02:35.629 --> 02:38.213

- Farmer.

- In God's name, you cannot do this.

Half. His mother was English.

05:38.645 --> 05:41.480
GRANVILLE: Perhaps he'll be a bit
more inclined to see reason then.

05:41.481 --> 05:43.732

concerned about reason, major.

05:43.733 --> 05:45.234
He's a scholar.

05:45.235 --> 05:47.528

06:06.172 --> 06:10.092
When did he develop
this archaeological bent?

06:10.093 --> 06:12.052
Right after the war.

06:12.053 --> 06:14.888
- There was an incident.
- Yes.

And his standing in the Church now?

06:23.732 --> 06:26.223
Undecided.

06:27.152 --> 06:32.015
The site is right west of Lake
Rudolf, in the Turkana district.

06:32.115 --> 06:37.607
It's Early Christian, which makes for
quite a mystery given its location.

06:40.415 --> 06:42.499
Anyway...

06:42.500 --> 06:46.003
we won't know more about it
until we get inside the thing.

06:54.596 --> 06:57.056
I am sorry.

06:57.057 --> 07:00.164
It's a question of status, you see.

listed as a displaced person.

to clear the matter up?

- I'd rather not. Thank you.

08:03.707 --> 08:06.399

of this significance...

who is on sabbatical.

- Temporary sabbatical.
- Which comes up for review shortly.

this up with the governor's office.

08:41.703 --> 08:44.561

The cardinal wants to be sure
that the site's religious aspects...

08:55.675 --> 08:57.926
are given proper consideration.
