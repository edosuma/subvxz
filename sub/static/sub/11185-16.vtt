00:00.901 --> 00:03.609
You got to tell me what
you want, little man.

00:03.670 --> 00:05.946
Otherwise, I got no way of know’n.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.385
What have you done with my grandson?

00:09.443 --> 00:10.444
Where is he?

00:10.511 --> 00:13.492
I know all the legalities and
you are in a lot of trouble.

00:13.547 --> 00:14.855
Take him alive.

00:17.918 --> 00:20.660
We gotta get that baby
out of the county pronto.

00:22.256 --> 00:25.999
Leave that baby inside and
come out with your hands up.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.404
Who is that clown on String's tail?

02:10.163 --> 02:12.165
Herb Waldren. Look at him go.

02:14.701 --> 02:17.705
Come on hotshot, show
me what you're made of.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.013
He's a friend of mine Dom, don't worry.

02:52.072 --> 02:54.780
Yeah, famous last words, "don't worry."

02:54.841 --> 02:57.412
Oh relax, pal, he's
just have’n a little fun.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.089
Fun?

03:00.414 --> 03:03.361
Greg, that's your pal String
up there testing your plane

03:03.417 --> 03:05.226
and that clown's having fun?

03:06.653 --> 03:08.132
Oh, no.

03:10.657 --> 03:13.934
Just call me Super Glue, hotshot.
I'm sticking to your tail.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.434
What do you think, String?
Should I buy that old war bird?

03:50.397 --> 03:51.899
You know, you could have killed us both.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.844
Aw come on, you know we were
just kidding around up there.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.006
I don't ever fool around up there.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.912
Anybody who does is a damn fool.

04:02.442 --> 04:03.512
Who is this guy?

04:03.577 --> 04:06.820
He was my Instructor when I was
a 19-year-old 2nd Louie.

04:07.414 --> 04:11.794
He never stopped talking about safety, about
controlling our instincts to “hot dog.”

04:12.319 --> 04:14.458
He's the best pilot I've ever seen.

04:14.721 --> 04:17.463
Apparently, you haven't seen
that many real pilots.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.765
Waldron, you were out of line up there.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.362
And you're lucky I don't report you.

04:21.428 --> 04:24.341
Sure. I'll tell you what I did
figure out while I was up there though

04:24.397 --> 04:27.708
is how you Nam boys piled up
all those oak leaf clusters.

04:27.768 --> 04:28.872
And what's that supposed to mean?

04:28.935 --> 04:31.211
Well, the way I figured is you took off,

04:31.304 --> 04:32.544
and you came back.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.085
So, you got credit for the mission.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.984
You know something, Waldren?

04:36.977 --> 04:40.015
You'd have had the shortest
career ever in Vietnam.

04:40.247 --> 04:42.591
Your own men would’ve seen to that.

05:07.541 --> 05:11.182
Hey, your friend Greg's got
a nice little set-up here.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.889
Well, when your name is Stewart

05:12.946 --> 05:14.823
and you live in a place called Stewartville,

05:14.881 --> 05:16.019
that oughta tell you someth’n.

05:16.082 --> 05:17.186
I'm impressed.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.526
But remember, we came up
here to go fish’n, huh?

05:19.586 --> 05:22.396
Yeah, we'll go first thing in the morn’n.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.434
Hey, could you see yourself live’n here?

05:25.692 --> 05:28.263
So what, you've got
something against rich people?

05:28.328 --> 05:31.138
None of ‘em ever adopted me.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.809
- Rainey…
- Please, Greg.

05:36.102 --> 05:37.877
I wanna do the right thing.

05:37.938 --> 05:41.943
Rainey dear, don't you
think I know how you feel?

05:43.276 --> 05:46.587
I know what it would have been
like if I'd had to give Greg up.

05:47.547 --> 05:50.118
But I ask you not to think with your heart.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.621
I'm trying, Mrs. Stewart.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.688
Motherhood is a responsibility.

05:55.689 --> 05:59.102
The responsibility of doing
the best for your child.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.268
I know that. I just…

06:02.796 --> 06:05.402
I need the time to think it over again.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.940
Sign the papers, Rainey.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.980
Give me custody of our baby and
know for the rest of your life

06:12.038 --> 06:14.678
that he'll grow up
strong and safe right here,

06:15.075 --> 06:18.613
educated, knowing books, music, everything.

06:19.579 --> 06:21.422
Everything I can't give him.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.457
Rainy, the baby is a Stewart.

06:24.517 --> 06:27.657
Someday, he'll take his rightful
position in this State.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.298
A position of wealth and power.

06:31.157 --> 06:33.899
And he must be trained
to be ready for that day.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.472
Do you think I'm not capable of raising him?

06:36.529 --> 06:37.803
Not for that.

06:37.864 --> 06:40.174
You have no experience of that world.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.735
It baffles you.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.474
- Mother.
- Greg, it's all right.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.880
She's probably right.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.247
What is it, Herb?

06:47.307 --> 06:51.653
Excuse the interruption but that hotshot
pilot, Hawke, is outside look’n for you.

06:52.445 --> 06:54.652
You remember Stringfellow Hawke?
You met him at our wedding.

06:54.714 --> 06:56.990
Sure, how could I forget a name like that?

06:57.050 --> 07:01.021
And Greg, remember you've got to get
that plane back to San Jose by 5:00.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.924
I didn't know it was that late.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.797
Mother, let's finish this tomorrow.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.800
- But…
- Mrs. Stewart,

07:08.862 --> 07:10.603
I'd like some more time.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.877
Very well.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.486
Why'd you break me and Greg up?

07:28.548 --> 07:32.519
It was Greg's decision to end
the marriage. That's the past.

07:32.585 --> 07:35.498
I want to talk about my grandson's future.

07:36.356 --> 07:39.064
Not now, Mrs. Stewart. Excuse me, please.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.103
Herbert,

07:45.598 --> 07:50.343
I want you to make sure that
she does not leave the grounds
until those papers are signed.

07:50.637 --> 07:51.775
No problem.

07:52.138 --> 07:56.518
Incidentally, Mrs. Stewart, any time you
want me to talk to her, just say the word.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.419
No, that won't be necessary.

07:58.578 --> 08:00.751
Now, I'd better see about my guests.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.025
Thank you.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.197
Hors d'oeuvre, gentlemen?

08:10.056 --> 08:11.797
- No, thanks.
- Hey, Greg.

08:12.292 --> 08:15.034
Hawke, Dom, hey listen, glad you made it.

08:15.395 --> 08:16.840
I'm sorry I wasn't here to greet you.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.705
We've been looking over your spread.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.210
Great place.

08:20.934 --> 08:24.006
Greg, you know Dom and I were
think’n about take’n off this afternoon,

08:24.070 --> 08:25.777
try and make the mountains before dark.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.649
Come on, you can't go
now. You just got here.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.052
Look, I've got to ferry that
Corsair back up to San Jose.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.919
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

08:32.979 --> 08:35.390
Why don't you stay here, enjoy the party?

08:36.282 --> 08:38.352
Greg, you know I'm not
much of a party person.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.489
Well, you haven't even
had a chance to visit yet.

08:40.553 --> 08:42.554
Hoist a few, swap some stories.

08:42.989 --> 08:45.401
The fish will be there in the
morning. I'll pay for the motel.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.597
That's not necessary Greg, just…

08:47.927 --> 08:51.033
you've got all these guests, I
figured you'd be entertaining.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.508
They'll all be gone in a few hours.

08:52.565 --> 08:55.705
We can spend the whole evening
together. Now what do you say?

08:58.605 --> 09:00.175
One condition.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.286
We get to meet that son of yours.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.948
Yeah, we want to see what
all that brag’ns about.

09:05.011 --> 09:06.786
It's a deal. He's in the house.

09:06.846 --> 09:10.055
As soon as I get back, you'll
get a formal introduction.

09:10.483 --> 09:11.894
Look, I gotta go.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.156
Dismissed, Lieutenant.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.327
Get outta here, adios, will ya?

09:22.062 --> 09:25.407
Something tells me it's going
to be along couple of hours.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.737
Let's make the best of it.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.154
What do you think I should do?

09:38.845 --> 09:43.487
If I leave you here, you'll grow
up to be educated and confident,

09:43.583 --> 09:45.392
rich, without even trying.

09:48.521 --> 09:52.094
I take you with me, all you'll get
is all the love I can give you.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.763
What do you say, little guy?

09:57.497 --> 10:00.307
Okay.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.170
Come on.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.041
Sorry, ma'am.

10:31.097 --> 10:34.408
This car isn't going anywhere
until Mrs. Stewart wants it to.

10:38.204 --> 10:40.844
What do you say, we hop
the fence, get the car?

10:42.876 --> 10:43.946
Rainey.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.216
Hi, Hawke.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.758
Dom, you remember Rainey, Greg's wife.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.054
Of course I do.

10:49.115 --> 10:51.186
Well, used to be Greg's wife.

10:52.218 --> 10:53.697
Sorry.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.094
Is this little Greg?

10:56.156 --> 10:57.328
- Yes.
- May I?

10:57.390 --> 10:58.391
Sure.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.869
Look at him, he's smile’n at me.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.802
He did.

11:05.865 --> 11:08.072
He's usually afraid of strangers.

11:08.134 --> 11:11.707
What? Who's the stranger?
I'm his Uncle Dom here.

11:13.406 --> 11:17.081
You know Rainey, it's hard to think
about you and Greg be’n apart.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.185
I remember the wedding,

11:20.280 --> 11:21.884
I never saw 2 happier people.

11:21.948 --> 11:25.191
Yeah well, things change, I guess.

11:26.819 --> 11:29.060
Hawke, could you do me a favor?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.430
Anything…

11:31.958 --> 11:33.960
I need a lift into town.

11:34.794 --> 11:36.034
Now?

11:37.830 --> 11:40.436
Well, our station wagon's right over here.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.537
It's crammed full of fish’n gear,

11:42.602 --> 11:45.481
but we can make room for you. Come on.

11:48.775 --> 11:49.981
Hold it.

11:53.079 --> 11:54.990
Sorry, I can't let you leave, ma'am.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.152
Who says?

11:56.216 --> 11:57.695
It's Mrs. Stewart's orders.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.491
It's quite all right, really.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.997
No, it's not all right.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.967
You 2 want to leave,
that's fine. She stays here.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.003
If I was you,

12:06.359 --> 12:08.635
I'd take your hands off the lady, now.

12:08.928 --> 12:13.434
I don't want any trouble. Why don't you
let Mrs. Stewart explain it to you?

12:15.735 --> 12:16.907
If you like.

12:17.770 --> 12:21.343
It's very sad. She's a very sweet girl.

12:21.507 --> 12:23.885
But she's not taking
the divorce well at all.

12:23.943 --> 12:26.856
She's been distraught and moody.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.784
That's no reason to
hold her prisoner, ma'am.

12:29.849 --> 12:34.320
Oh really, gentlemen, there's no
reason to be so melodramatic.

12:34.954 --> 12:37.764
It is true that we are trying
to keep Rainey on the estate,

12:37.824 --> 12:41.636
but it's for her own good
and the good of the baby.

12:41.728 --> 12:45.266
She is not in a proper emotional condition

12:45.331 --> 12:47.868
to be on her own with a young child.

12:48.868 --> 12:53.374
We do appreciate your
concern, but please believe me,

12:53.740 --> 12:57.882
we have only Rainey's interest at heart.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.317
You buy what she said?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.422
No, not exactly.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.727
I'd like to double check
everything with Greg.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.234
Hi, what'd you think of Mrs. Stewart?

13:11.858 --> 13:13.030
Quite a lady.

13:14.160 --> 13:18.108
I understand that you've
been kind of upset lately.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.171
I guess that's true.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.213
It's been very hard.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.681
Look, if you still want to leave…

13:24.737 --> 13:28.082
Oh, no, no. That's fine.
Everything's been taken care of.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.484
Are you leave’n?

13:29.542 --> 13:30.782
Well…

13:31.978 --> 13:34.151
I'm really not much into party’n.

13:34.213 --> 13:36.489
I think we'll come back this
evening and have a talk with Greg.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.551
Great. Maybe I'll see you then.

13:39.018 --> 13:41.089
Thank you both,

13:43.323 --> 13:44.825
for everything.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.993
Hello?

14:10.049 --> 14:11.323
Mrs. Stewart?

14:11.384 --> 14:12.590
Yes?

14:13.553 --> 14:15.931
This is Herb Waldren.

14:17.190 --> 14:21.366
Herbert, what is it? You sound strange.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.272
Right after Greg took off,
there was an accident.

14:29.135 --> 14:31.240
Greg's all right, isn't he?

14:32.505 --> 14:35.418
No, no, he's not, ma'am. I'm sorry.

14:35.475 --> 14:38.479
I am really sorry. I
know how close you 2 were.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.123
Mrs. Stewart, are you there?

14:52.592 --> 14:55.869
You haven't contacted the
Coroner's Office, have you?

14:56.462 --> 14:58.237
No. No, not yet.

14:58.297 --> 15:02.006
Nobody knows but Amie, me
and a couple of farmers.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.778
I want you to bring my son home.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.115
You think that's wise?

15:10.176 --> 15:12.019
Just bring him home.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.925
Right away.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.231
Oh, God.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.531
God.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.435
It's a damn shame.

15:29.962 --> 15:33.273
2 nice kids like Greg and
Rainey and that little baby.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.345
They ought to be the
happiest family in the world.

15:37.403 --> 15:40.077
Instead, one big miserable mess.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.445
Well, I'll reach Greg in an hour or so.

15:43.743 --> 15:47.816
I'll have a little more to talk
about this time than just old times.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.063
Did you just gurgle?

16:21.013 --> 16:24.017
Great Jumping Jehoshaphat!

16:29.288 --> 16:33.361
Look at what we got here. Hey, how are you?

16:35.995 --> 16:38.202
- Oh, brother.
- My goodness.

16:39.265 --> 16:41.142
Kid's got a lot of class.

16:44.270 --> 16:48.514
“Dear String and Dom, Greg's
Mother wants to take my baby from me.”

16:49.709 --> 16:52.417
“Please get him out of
this county right away”

16:52.478 --> 16:54.116
“and bring him to my family.”

16:55.515 --> 16:57.961
She's got an address.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.258
“Thank you and God bless you. Rainey.”

17:00.920 --> 17:02.957
She sure sounds desperate.

17:05.825 --> 17:08.237
You think we oughta take him to her folks?

17:08.728 --> 17:09.762
I don't know.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.673
We don't want to be accessories to
some kind of custody kidnapping.

17:12.732 --> 17:13.801
No.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.506
Maybe I better get a hold of Greg.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.352
So, what are we gonna do
with him in the meantime?

17:23.342 --> 17:25.617
I'm sure you'll figure out someth’n, Mom.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.624
Where did you get this…

17:29.315 --> 17:32.125
Oh, honest.

17:38.424 --> 17:41.633
Greg was supposed to be back hours ago.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.643
I'll speak to his Mother then.

17:50.369 --> 17:51.973
What about Rainey?

17:52.338 --> 17:54.545
Yes, that's right.

17:55.541 --> 17:58.886
Where's that? All right.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.285
Boy, this stinks.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.926
They say that Greg's nowhere to be found,

18:07.219 --> 18:09.062
his Mother's not available,

18:09.221 --> 18:13.328
and Rainey's gone back to her
parents' farm some 35 miles from here.

19:06.345 --> 19:07.688
Mrs. Stewart?

19:13.152 --> 19:15.154
Where do you want me to put him?

19:18.457 --> 19:20.061
Downstairs.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.229
For a while.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.808
Tonight. Tomorrow.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.403
We'll have to move him tomorrow.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.348
Obviously,

19:34.807 --> 19:36.582
Rainey mustn't know.

19:37.710 --> 19:38.950
I understand.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.289
Still no answer at Rainey's parents.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.822
Well, it doesn't mean she isn't there.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.231
Maybe she's just not answering.

19:50.289 --> 19:51.632
From the looks of it, it seemed to me

19:51.691 --> 19:54.672
she was due for a little
rest and relaxation.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.803
Suppose you could be right.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.941
Listen, I'm gonna go out there.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.446
It's the only way I'll ever know for sure.

20:04.470 --> 20:06.108
I'll be back.

20:09.909 --> 20:13.447
Okay, okay, Uncle String
wasn't that good a company.

20:14.313 --> 20:17.726
Okay, I got it, dinner time.

20:17.817 --> 20:21.162
Yeah, dinner. Okay. There we go.

20:21.253 --> 20:24.393
Just what Mama wanted. Lookie here.

20:25.091 --> 20:27.435
And now, the bottle…

20:30.963 --> 20:33.944
How the hell are you gonna
pour anything into this?

20:39.672 --> 20:41.276
Santini Air.

20:41.707 --> 20:44.244
What? You have a baby?

20:44.310 --> 20:46.051
Listen.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.724
Dom, you really do have a baby there.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.690
And look,

20:55.755 --> 20:59.794
I'm sort of baby-sit’n, you know
what I mean? And I swear to God

20:59.992 --> 21:03.439
I got a baby bottle here
that's more air than bottle.

21:04.697 --> 21:05.698
Dom,

21:06.031 --> 21:08.511
you need the disposable
liners in that bottle.

21:08.567 --> 21:11.309
You know, the little plastic
bags that hold everything.

21:12.204 --> 21:15.913
Little plastic bags… Hold it,
just a minute. Hold it right there.

21:16.642 --> 21:17.985
Little plastic bags.

21:18.043 --> 21:20.922
We're get’n it, baby.
We're get’n it, sweetheart.

21:25.618 --> 21:29.293
I got it Cate, I got it, baby.
Thanks a million.

21:29.355 --> 21:31.460
Right. Hey, where did you get that baby?

21:31.524 --> 21:34.505
No, no, no. I got no time now.
I got no time. Tell you later.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.903
Mamma mia.

21:43.602 --> 21:45.104
Progress.

22:13.265 --> 22:15.040
Sit down.

22:18.103 --> 22:21.550
You know Herbert, it's more
important to me now than ever

22:22.074 --> 22:25.021
that Rainey sign over my grandson's custody.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.222
Yes, before anyone finds out about Greg.

22:28.781 --> 22:33.491
In the outside world, you
see all kinds of behavior,

22:34.253 --> 22:35.789
some of it violent.

22:36.889 --> 22:39.369
You must have many ways of dealing with

22:40.259 --> 22:41.795
difficult problems.

22:43.662 --> 22:44.868
Well, yes I do.

22:44.930 --> 22:49.174
So, if Rainey should continue to refuse…

22:51.303 --> 22:53.647
I will deal with the problem.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.982
With no ties to this house.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.919
Absolutely none.

22:58.944 --> 23:02.517
I assure you there will be
a big bonus in it for you.

23:02.915 --> 23:06.886
A bonus big enough for you to want
to hide it in a distant bank.

23:07.253 --> 23:10.564
Perhaps something in the Caribbean.

23:31.277 --> 23:33.314
What are you doing here?

23:34.914 --> 23:36.416
Take it easy, take it easy.

23:36.482 --> 23:39.053
You get out of here right now or I'm
gonna scream. You understand me?

23:39.118 --> 23:42.156
- You hear me? Get out.
- All right. All right.

23:53.299 --> 23:54.369
Santini Air.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.810
Cate, help.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.541
Listen, the kid won't stop cry’n.

23:58.637 --> 24:01.140
I fed him, I burped him

24:01.206 --> 24:03.277
and he's wailing like a banshee.

24:03.909 --> 24:05.286
How hard did you pat him?

24:05.344 --> 24:07.881
Gently. Very gently.

24:08.013 --> 24:10.960
Okay, well, do it just about as
hard as you do for your heartburn.

24:15.487 --> 24:17.091
Where are you guys, anyway?

24:17.156 --> 24:19.227
Stewartsville.

24:19.591 --> 24:21.264
But where? I mean, what's going on?

24:25.064 --> 24:27.567
The burp of the year.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.277
Thanks, Cate. See you later.

24:31.537 --> 24:32.811
Anytime, Dad.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.156
The burp of the year.

24:51.056 --> 24:52.763
Dom, String here.

24:52.825 --> 24:53.963
Any luck?

24:54.026 --> 24:56.165
I've been to Rainey's parents' place.

24:56.528 --> 24:58.735
They haven't seen anything of Rainey.

25:00.099 --> 25:01.874
I believe she's probably
still at the Stewarts'.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.946
Which means?

25:04.003 --> 25:06.142
Which means somebody's lying to me.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.045
I doubt it's them.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.818
I spent most of the night talk’n with
‘em about Rainey and the Stewarts.

25:10.876 --> 25:12.583
And those folks are on the level.

25:13.879 --> 25:16.359
Where you go’n now? You need some sleep.

25:16.582 --> 25:18.789
I've got to get some answers.

25:20.085 --> 25:21.428
I'll probably go over
to the Stewarts' place.

25:21.487 --> 25:25.025
I'm gonna find Rainey or Greg or
somebody who'll tell me the truth.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.997
You're nuts, you know that?

25:33.899 --> 25:36.140
It's wonderful what a little burp’ll do.

25:43.242 --> 25:45.347
Good morning, Rainey.

25:45.411 --> 25:48.255
You asked for one more
day and that time is up.

25:48.680 --> 25:51.354
Now, take this pen and sign.

25:52.451 --> 25:55.489
Do the sensible thing for you and your son.

25:57.189 --> 25:59.032
I'm sorry, Mrs. Stewart.

25:59.091 --> 26:03.164
I have made a decision and I'm not
gonna give you custody of little Greg.

26:04.096 --> 26:06.007
No, you can't mean that, Rainey.

26:06.065 --> 26:10.275
There comes a time in every young
person's life when they need guidance.

26:11.336 --> 26:13.179
You might as well save
your breath, Mrs. Stewart.

26:13.238 --> 26:16.242
You can't wear me down and I'm
not going to give you my baby.

26:16.308 --> 26:18.515
You should just understand
that and let me go.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.582
Deep down there is some strength.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.602
What have you done with my grandson?

26:39.998 --> 26:41.170
Where is he?

26:42.634 --> 26:44.272
Rainey, where is he?

26:45.804 --> 26:48.785
Rainey. Rainey it's me, String!

26:52.644 --> 26:54.351
- Hey, Rainey!
- Hawke?

26:57.049 --> 26:59.325
Now I know what you've done with him.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.306
Hello, chicken.

27:13.332 --> 27:14.640
Waldren.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.841
You've got Waldren for your County Sheriff.

27:23.742 --> 27:25.653
Must be kind of embarrassing,

27:26.311 --> 27:28.291
having a peace officer
that's more dangerous

27:28.347 --> 27:31.089
than most of the criminals in the country.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.458
Keep that up, bright boy…

27:32.518 --> 27:34.464
That's enough, Herbert.

27:34.753 --> 27:36.892
What can I do for you, Mr. Hawke?

27:36.955 --> 27:38.457
I wanna talk with Greg.

27:38.524 --> 27:40.026
He's not here.

27:41.727 --> 27:42.797
What about Rainey?

27:42.861 --> 27:45.364
She's gone too, with Greg.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.611
With Greg?

27:49.768 --> 27:52.374
Yes, they left early this morning.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.114
I think they are going
to get back together again.

27:55.174 --> 27:58.678
And I'm to take charge
of the baby until they return.

28:00.746 --> 28:03.522
I'm very sorry about that, Mrs. Stewart.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.995
It's not gonna happen

28:06.218 --> 28:09.131
unless I speak in person
with Greg or Rainey.

28:10.155 --> 28:11.691
Now you listen to me, Hawke.

28:11.757 --> 28:14.169
I've got written permission from the parent

28:14.493 --> 28:16.336
to take charge of that child.

28:17.896 --> 28:20.240
I want my grandson, Mr. Hawke.

28:21.266 --> 28:24.509
And I want your son
right here in front of me.

28:24.903 --> 28:26.905
Because he'll tell me the truth.

28:27.306 --> 28:30.583
Mrs. Stewart, we had a
discussion a little while ago

28:30.642 --> 28:31.950
about how you wanted things done.

28:32.010 --> 28:34.251
Does that extend to this situation here?

28:35.447 --> 28:37.586
Yes, I believe so, Herbert.

28:38.650 --> 28:40.129
Then let's go.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.003
Now Herbert, I would like to have…

28:58.237 --> 29:00.683
All right, that was Hawke! Take him alive!

29:00.806 --> 29:02.683
Let's go. Move it, now!

29:12.150 --> 29:13.857
Arnie, come in.

29:16.121 --> 29:17.862
Yes, Herb?

31:16.441 --> 31:17.613
Santini Air.

31:18.543 --> 31:21.149
Cate, we need the Lady.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.082
We're in trouble here.

31:23.148 --> 31:24.957
Okay, give me the location.

31:25.117 --> 31:26.152
Yes, yes, yes.

31:27.753 --> 31:30.256
All right, okay, yeah.

31:30.722 --> 31:31.723
Hello?

31:31.857 --> 31:34.599
Waldren and his Deputies
are all over the place.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.464
We gotta get that baby
out of the county pronto.

31:37.529 --> 31:39.236
We can't do it by go’n over the roads.

31:39.431 --> 31:42.503
I already called Caitlin, She'll be
at the motel as soon as possible.

31:42.567 --> 31:43.705
She's bring’n in the Lady.

31:43.769 --> 31:45.112
What about you?

31:45.404 --> 31:48.283
I'm go’n back to the Stewarts'
to see if I can find Rainey.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.190
Okay, okay, buddy.

32:10.996 --> 32:13.306
Why is it taking so long?

32:13.365 --> 32:15.675
2 strangers and a baby in a small town.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.242
Waldren here.

32:22.107 --> 32:24.087
It's about time. Where?

32:24.476 --> 32:26.752
All right, stay there. Wait for me.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.452
- We've located ‘em.
- Where?

32:29.548 --> 32:31.323
They're holed up in a motel
out on the old highway.

32:31.383 --> 32:34.193
I'll have your grandson
back here for you in no time.

32:34.252 --> 32:35.731
- Herbert.
- Yes, ma'am?

32:37.022 --> 32:39.127
Be very careful with little Greg.

32:39.691 --> 32:40.999
I will.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.140
And when you come back,

32:44.496 --> 32:46.874
I want that girl taken care of.

32:49.334 --> 32:50.642
I'll see to it.

33:30.075 --> 33:34.490
You don't seem to have grasped the
fact that there is no more talk.

33:34.546 --> 33:38.551
I've already talked to Herbert and
told him to do whatever was necessary.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.755
Greg'll never let you
hurt me no matter what.

33:42.020 --> 33:46.560
Don't you understand?
Greg can't help you anymore.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.399
Greg is dead!

34:28.766 --> 34:30.041
Rainey?

34:31.735 --> 34:33.043
Rainey.

34:33.471 --> 34:34.677
He's dead.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.713
She said that Greg's dead.

34:44.516 --> 34:46.052
You think it's true?

34:47.485 --> 34:50.523
Honey, I don't know. I've
looked for him everywhere.

34:52.190 --> 34:55.194
Everybody I ask about him seems
like they're hiding something.

34:55.260 --> 34:59.003
His Mother's been acting
so weird since last night.

35:05.370 --> 35:07.441
What happened last night?

35:08.773 --> 35:11.276
A helicopter came and landed on the lawn

35:11.343 --> 35:14.449
and 2 men carried something into the house.

35:14.546 --> 35:15.991
Could you tell what it was?

35:16.047 --> 35:18.653
No, it was too far away.

35:20.819 --> 35:22.799
Do helicopters land here often?

35:22.854 --> 35:24.629
Yeah, but not at night.

35:30.095 --> 35:34.805
Rainey, is there a cellar
or storage or anyplace cool?

35:36.501 --> 35:38.503
There's a wine cellar.

35:49.614 --> 35:52.322
Couple of minutes, you and me are
gonna go for a nice little ride.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.033
Santini.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.368
Santini?

36:02.193 --> 36:03.695
This is the Sheriff.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.705
I'm ordering you to leave that baby inside

36:09.334 --> 36:11.336
and come out with your hands up.

36:12.537 --> 36:15.746
And I'm ask’n you if you've
got a search warrant.

36:28.787 --> 36:30.994
They got a search warrant, all right.

36:31.856 --> 36:34.598
Now, either you come out,

36:35.493 --> 36:36.972
or we're come’n in.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.069
Which is it gonna be?

36:41.533 --> 36:44.377
Come on, kid. We're gonna go, huh?

36:44.436 --> 36:46.279
Gonna go for a nice little ride, okay?

36:46.337 --> 36:48.578
All right, we're come’n out.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.586
We're come’n out, you hear me?

36:52.243 --> 36:53.722
Put down your guns.

36:57.148 --> 36:59.094
You hear me? We're come’n out.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.392
Put down those guns, now.

37:10.228 --> 37:14.005
You got no right to do this. His
Mother asked me to take care of him.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.738
She changed her mind.

37:16.501 --> 37:18.640
Well, I wanna hear that from her.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.525
Back off, Sheriff.

37:31.015 --> 37:32.551
You're obstructing justice.

37:32.617 --> 37:34.722
I order you to get out of the way.

37:35.987 --> 37:38.058
Is he in for a surprise!

37:38.123 --> 37:40.763
Come on, let's get out
of the way, little man.

37:41.025 --> 37:42.436
Give it your best shot.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.710
Open fire.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.786
No! Greg!

38:42.587 --> 38:44.191
Rainey, listen to me.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.370
Put this out of your mind, right now.

38:47.425 --> 38:49.234
You think about your baby.

38:50.295 --> 38:51.433
Okay.

38:59.237 --> 39:01.877
Get down, get down. Stay outta sight.

39:28.499 --> 39:30.604
Poor, sweet Greg.

39:31.669 --> 39:34.616
I'm so sorry I got you in all this trouble.

39:34.973 --> 39:38.216
You didn't, Waldren and Mrs. Stewart did.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.214
Pull over. Don't make me shoot.

41:18.876 --> 41:20.856
Waldren, we're down.

41:20.912 --> 41:23.620
Hawke and the girl are heading east on 105.

41:32.924 --> 41:35.996
Don't worry, we got him. Safe and sound.

41:36.060 --> 41:37.801
Thank you.

41:37.862 --> 41:41.332
He's gorgeous. What's his name?

41:41.399 --> 41:43.379
Greg, after his Father.

41:43.434 --> 41:44.845
Oh, baby.

41:44.902 --> 41:46.279
Come on, let's get outta here.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.941
No, no, no. Me and Greg can't…

41:48.006 --> 41:51.317
No, no, no, he's safer then he would
be in his own playpen. Come on.

41:51.376 --> 41:52.855
Come on Dom, get this thing fired up.

41:52.910 --> 41:53.911
Okay.

42:26.077 --> 42:27.488
That's a P-51.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.718
Yeah, same one that came after me.

42:29.781 --> 42:31.761
- The same pilot?
- Probably.

42:31.816 --> 42:34.387
He was the guy at the motel, the Sheriff.

42:34.485 --> 42:37.022
Yeah, Herb Waldren.

42:49.367 --> 42:51.369
Dom, open Waldren's radio channel.

42:51.436 --> 42:52.574
Done.

42:52.637 --> 42:54.810
Waldren, don't make me take you down.

42:55.840 --> 42:58.218
You couldn't do it on your best day.

43:43.054 --> 43:45.534
It's all over, Rainey. Baby still okay?

43:46.891 --> 43:48.165
You bet.

43:49.494 --> 43:51.235
Talk about your cool customers.

43:52.430 --> 43:55.639
Look at him. That
little wolf was born to fly.

44:17.221 --> 44:19.098
You must be very happy.

44:19.357 --> 44:22.338
No, ma'am. I lost someone I loved.

44:33.905 --> 44:36.112
Well now, if you'll escort me,

44:36.174 --> 44:38.518
I will place myself in your charge.

44:38.943 --> 44:41.890
My lawyer will outline
for you what I expect.

44:42.747 --> 44:45.250
I want a cell all to myself

44:45.850 --> 44:49.024
with ample room and lots of privacy.

44:49.887 --> 44:52.766
Well apart from the
other cells. And I would…

44:52.823 --> 44:55.929
Oh, yes, I must make
arrangements for phone service.

44:55.993 --> 44:57.495
Thank you very much.

44:59.931 --> 45:03.071
Well, I know I shouldn't,
but I feel sorry for her.

45:03.434 --> 45:05.072
That's okay, I do too.

45:05.903 --> 45:07.905
You're going to your folks' house now?

45:07.972 --> 45:09.315
For a while.

45:09.674 --> 45:12.280
I think we're gonna need
some family around us.

45:12.343 --> 45:13.981
Well, they're awful good people.

45:14.045 --> 45:15.752
They'll help you through this.

45:18.149 --> 45:19.890
Say, look…

45:20.351 --> 45:22.763
on my weekends off,
do you mind very much if I…

45:22.820 --> 45:25.460
Anytime you like. You
have an open invitation.

45:25.523 --> 45:29.528
Besides, little Greg cannot miss
seeing his favorite Uncle Dom.

45:37.368 --> 45:39.279
There he is. Hey!
