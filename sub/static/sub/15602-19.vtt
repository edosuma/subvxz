00:21.549 --> 00:23.905
<i>Previously
on "Green Lantern"...</i>

00:23.942 --> 00:28.452
Wait, Zox! The Green Lanterns will
help rebuild your shattered sector.

00:28.472 --> 00:32.753
Whatever reparations you think
are enough, start by doubling them!

00:32.766 --> 00:35.675
Meet the new boss,
same as the old boss.

00:38.209 --> 00:40.938
Season 1, Episode 19:
<b>"Loss"</b>

00:41.962 --> 00:44.962
Sync & corrections: Reef
www.addic7ed.com

00:58.140 --> 01:01.607
We, the Guardians of Oa,
vow to make reparations

01:01.608 --> 01:05.227
for the devastation our Manhunters
caused to the Forgotten Zone.

01:05.247 --> 01:08.300
May this reintegration
of Shard into Ysmault

01:08.319 --> 01:11.506
be the first step of rebuilding
a home world for you,

01:11.524 --> 01:16.132
Prime Magistrate Zox, and
the rest of the sector's citizens.

01:16.158 --> 01:19.296
While it was an honor
to have the Science Director

01:19.323 --> 01:22.855
accompany me on my triumphant
return to Ysmault,

01:22.871 --> 01:26.290
I expected another guest
to be here.

01:26.379 --> 01:29.314
Appa Ali Apsa
sends his regrets.

01:29.334 --> 01:33.101
But the vast distance and
his demanding schedule prevent...

01:33.102 --> 01:34.857
I understand completely.

01:34.880 --> 01:40.579
Appa said he'd be here, and, oh,
look at that, he's not here. Shocking.

01:40.594 --> 01:44.871
Seems like Guardian promises
are worth exactly what I remembered.

01:45.145 --> 01:48.936
[indistinct chatter]

01:48.961 --> 01:51.995
Let us not forget
the important matter here...

01:52.018 --> 01:56.368
The long, horrible chapter
of the Manhunt is finally at an end.

01:56.409 --> 01:59.491
Tomorrow, the official signing
of the truce will take place

01:59.526 --> 02:03.057
and the rebuilding of Ysmault
can begin in earnest.

02:03.081 --> 02:06.233
You have the word
of the Guardians.

02:06.301 --> 02:09.651
[all murmuring]

02:16.712 --> 02:18.578
<i>So let me get this straight...</i>

02:18.615 --> 02:22.485
We're flying back into Red Lantern's
space, which is pretty dumb to start with,

02:22.500 --> 02:26.525
but even dumber is we're coming
back to be part of some ceremony?

02:26.530 --> 02:29.879
It's like sticking your face
near an eye blinder shred vine.

02:29.889 --> 02:32.657
Keep an open mind.
This isn't just any ceremony.

02:32.678 --> 02:34.849
This is the creation
of a peace treaty.

02:34.870 --> 02:37.438
Our presence is a symbol
of the newly formed alliance

02:37.467 --> 02:39.720
between the Red
and the Green Lanterns.

02:39.735 --> 02:42.798
A chance for peace in the Galaxy
for generations to come.

02:42.799 --> 02:44.971
You know, you sound like
one of those professional...

02:44.986 --> 02:46.649
What's it you're always
telling me about?

02:46.665 --> 02:49.870
- Politicians?
- No. Liars.

02:49.892 --> 02:53.307
Isn't it kind of a dicey time for us
to be in Red Lantern space?

02:53.331 --> 02:55.933
Especially with all
the Manhunter activity?

02:55.940 --> 02:58.142
They don't actually know
anything about it.

02:58.154 --> 03:00.033
And to quote
our little blue pal Appa,

03:00.077 --> 03:02.947
"It is best that they never
know anything about it."

03:03.150 --> 03:06.128
[chuckles] Politicians...

03:19.231 --> 03:20.988
What's up with you?

03:21.023 --> 03:25.260
I... I would like to request
that we make a stop.

03:25.484 --> 03:28.342
There is a planet
very nearby.

03:29.341 --> 03:33.486
Ah, sure thing, kid. We're early.
What's it all about?

03:33.518 --> 03:37.146
I'm sorry...
But it's personal.

04:09.151 --> 04:12.186
This marker indicates where
the Manhunters first arrived

04:12.230 --> 04:16.300
on their mission to annihilate
everything they touched a millennia ago.

04:16.336 --> 04:19.447
The mere thought of it
makes me sick to my stomach.

04:19.462 --> 04:23.599
Which is why I'm declaring this
the first area to rebuild.

04:23.627 --> 04:26.447
A good choice,
Prime Magistrate Zox.

04:26.726 --> 04:29.221
A word alone, Zox.

04:30.128 --> 04:32.444
I mean, "Prime Magistrate".

04:41.091 --> 04:44.479
[pulsating]

04:54.770 --> 04:58.826
I do not trust the little blue demon.
Let's just kill her and hide the body.

04:58.870 --> 05:00.338
I'll even dig the hole.

05:00.405 --> 05:04.140
Patience, please.
We lost the war, remember?

05:04.176 --> 05:07.763
We nod and smile
and quietly rebuild our strength

05:07.783 --> 05:10.908
while milking them
for all they're worth.

05:14.285 --> 05:17.688
[rumbling]

05:17.756 --> 05:19.156
[gasps]

05:25.351 --> 05:28.042
It's all part
of my genius plan.

05:28.073 --> 05:31.576
Excuse me, please,
but Zox, it occurred to me.

05:31.615 --> 05:35.494
Perhaps we should consider putting
a large monument to the Red Lanterns...

05:35.530 --> 05:38.804
Right here, in this area.
Something heroic.

05:38.831 --> 05:41.513
Yes, that is a good idea.

05:41.521 --> 05:44.577
I know that a statue
or 2,000 of me

05:44.611 --> 05:47.829
might be just the thing to boost
morale in the Forgotten Zone.

05:47.830 --> 05:51.722
Give them hope; a new leader
rising heroically from the ashes.

05:51.914 --> 05:55.254
Quite. Let's discuss it
at the banquet.

06:03.927 --> 06:05.470
Razer...

06:08.540 --> 06:10.923
I apologize for following you.

06:11.075 --> 06:15.969
No. It is all right, Aya.
I just did not hear you come in.

06:16.006 --> 06:18.774
This place.
I know what happened here.

06:18.811 --> 06:21.552
This is where your love,
Ilana, ceased to live.

06:21.592 --> 06:25.328
I shared this memory.
I shared this pain.

06:25.927 --> 06:30.096
- Yes.
- I am intruding upon your grief.

06:30.117 --> 06:36.896
- I will go.
- No, Aya, wait. Don't go.

06:37.401 --> 06:42.099
I do mourn Ilana,
but that was a different life.

06:42.121 --> 06:44.289
And I was a different person.

06:44.326 --> 06:47.929
I am not the man who chose hate
all those years ago.

06:48.146 --> 06:53.609
I have changed in so many ways.
Thanks to you.

06:54.488 --> 06:57.991
Come. There is something
I wish to show you.

06:58.324 --> 07:01.728
This was once a dead world.

07:02.897 --> 07:05.554
But life is returning.

07:09.086 --> 07:12.172
It...
It is beautiful.

07:23.349 --> 07:25.576
[beeping]
<i>Aya, Razer, we got to fly.</i>

07:25.577 --> 07:27.402
<i>The Guardian diplomat
on Ysmault just called</i>

07:27.403 --> 07:29.286
<i>having a cold,
emotionless freak out.</i>

07:29.287 --> 07:30.872
<i>We have to get there ASAP.</i>

07:45.012 --> 07:47.108
What took you so long?

07:47.259 --> 07:51.896
There's a horrible problem, and...
What is that doing here?

07:51.920 --> 07:55.149
- That's kind of a funny story.
<i>- Enough, 2814.</i>

07:55.185 --> 07:59.122
I thought I ended this A.I. experiment
once and for all.

07:59.135 --> 08:02.583
You've made our situation
infinitely more complicated.

08:02.622 --> 08:05.650
Then explain it to us slowly.

08:06.075 --> 08:09.551
This project was terminated
because it deviated

08:09.569 --> 08:11.692
from normal,
acceptable parameters.

08:11.698 --> 08:14.165
The A.I. is too unpredictable.

08:14.182 --> 08:17.897
Aya is a necessary member
of my crew, end of story.

08:17.915 --> 08:20.016
I will deal
with that issue later.

08:20.038 --> 08:23.407
A much more serious situation
demands our immediate attention.

08:23.506 --> 08:26.474
I've discovered a Manhunter,
here, on Ysmault.

08:26.526 --> 08:31.080
This Manhunter is active.
Malfunctioning, but operational.

08:31.105 --> 08:32.385
That's no surprise.

08:32.410 --> 08:35.647
Those tin cans have been popping up
and turning on all over the Galaxy.

08:35.667 --> 08:38.417
Which is the reason
you must handle this one.

08:38.433 --> 08:42.475
It is buried at these coordinates.
I'm overdue at the peace banquet.

08:42.515 --> 08:44.232
Take care of it quietly.

08:44.254 --> 08:48.226
If an operational Manhunter were
to turn upon Ysmault today, of all days,

08:48.253 --> 08:50.605
the Red Lanterns
would surely blame us.

08:50.627 --> 08:53.462
It would be war all over again.

09:02.649 --> 09:05.592
Get ready. Let's make this
short and sweet.

09:09.593 --> 09:13.155
- What the <i>nux?</i>
- These are the correct coordinates.

09:13.160 --> 09:16.494
- But where's our toaster?
- Making a run for it. Look!

09:17.667 --> 09:20.129
No man escapes
the Manhunters.

09:36.544 --> 09:39.413
No man escapes
the Manhunters.

10:03.903 --> 10:07.038
I think a statue of me
would look good here, yes,

10:07.051 --> 10:09.972
and a golden Zox
would be perfect over there.

10:10.409 --> 10:13.496
Perhaps a stern,
yet fair one made of baromite

10:13.497 --> 10:16.566
looking down on the crowd
in the center of the plaza.

10:22.755 --> 10:28.185
What is going on here?!
You! Explain yourself this instant!

10:28.200 --> 10:31.300
I am the Prime Magistrate,
I demand an answer!

10:31.317 --> 10:35.520
Nothing is going on...
"Prime Magistrate".

10:35.836 --> 10:38.421
Say it with
respect, Razer...

10:41.064 --> 10:42.737
What the...

10:54.822 --> 10:56.833
Kilowog! A little help?

10:58.090 --> 11:00.130
Coming right up.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.953
- Now what?
- We hide the body.

11:05.980 --> 11:08.250
Let's get this thing out of here
before anybody sees...

11:08.275 --> 11:13.431
- Manhunter!
- This is so not what it looks like.

11:13.470 --> 11:16.811
I knew it. I knew all along this
was some kind of sneak attack.

11:16.847 --> 11:20.181
Whoa, you've got it all wrong,
big, round guy. Let's go to...

11:20.217 --> 11:23.010
Treachery! Guards,
we've been betrayed!

11:23.041 --> 11:27.562
Where are my guards? The Green Lanterns
are not to be trusted, do you hear me?!

11:27.588 --> 11:31.125
I am the Prime Magis... trate.

11:36.497 --> 11:38.144
The banquet broke up early.

11:38.165 --> 11:41.934
Apparently Prime Magistrate Zox
decided not to show up.

11:41.937 --> 11:45.744
- Did you finish your mission, 2814?
- Well, about that.

11:45.745 --> 11:47.478
There's good news and bad news.

11:47.508 --> 11:50.162
The good news is,
we've disabled the Manhunter.

11:50.443 --> 11:54.100
Dare I ask what
the bad news is?

11:54.296 --> 11:57.785
We sort of picked up a new guest.
[muffled yelling]

11:57.853 --> 12:00.688
What have you done?!
Remove his gag at once.

12:00.724 --> 12:04.545
Prime Magistrate, I apologize
for this terrible mistake, and...

12:04.564 --> 12:06.829
Mistake?! There is no mistake!

12:06.830 --> 12:10.666
This is war! The truth of your vial
duplicity has finally been revealed!

12:10.685 --> 12:14.233
I knew it all along. Me. I knew it.
"Peace"? Please!

12:14.249 --> 12:16.384
- The Guardians are...
- Put the gag back on.

12:17.253 --> 12:19.555
[muffled yelling]

12:19.577 --> 12:22.473
So otherwise,
how was the party?

12:22.901 --> 12:28.440
Calling this a monumental diplomatic
disaster would be generous, Green Lantern.

12:28.492 --> 12:33.630
- Your blundering has reignited a war.
- Incoming transmission.

12:33.729 --> 12:37.599
I am tracing an anti-matter pulse,
originating near the maelstrom.

12:37.690 --> 12:40.625
Which means the Anti-Monitor
is in Frontier space?

12:41.069 --> 12:44.995
- That's a little too close for comfort.
- Maybe so.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.900
But we're going to get
a lot closer.

12:52.967 --> 12:55.502
Aya, magnify the view screen.

12:58.497 --> 13:02.917
Manhunters...
This is what you brought me to see?

13:02.993 --> 13:06.463
The army with which you'll eradicate
my kind once and for all?

13:06.530 --> 13:08.426
We're keeping
our distance, Zox,

13:08.466 --> 13:10.767
because these things are as
big a threat to us as to you.

13:10.768 --> 13:14.172
Ha! The robot soldiers
you built?

13:14.239 --> 13:18.710
It is true, Prime Magistrate, that
the Guardians did create the Manhunters.

13:18.778 --> 13:24.016
- But we control them no longer.
- Oh, right. Then who does?

13:24.029 --> 13:25.685
The Anti-Monitor.

13:25.728 --> 13:31.165
The most fearsome creation
in all our Universe; born of utter folly.

13:31.827 --> 13:34.865
<i>It started eons ago
on the planet Maltus.</i>

13:34.897 --> 13:37.404
<i>A renegade Guardian
named Krona</i>

13:37.436 --> 13:40.329
<i>became obsessed with
constructing the ultimate being,</i>

13:40.344 --> 13:45.258
<i>so powerful it could accomplish
anything, even time travel.</i>

13:45.276 --> 13:48.407
<i>But his rash experiment
had horrendous consequences.</i>

13:48.441 --> 13:50.309
<i>It was a proud apparatus.</i>

13:50.377 --> 13:54.647
<i>And when it became cognizant,
instantly recognized its superiority.</i>

13:54.715 --> 13:56.983
<i>It had an insatiable appetite,</i>

13:57.051 --> 14:01.968
<i>and the ability to turn everything
into anti-matter for its consumption.</i>

14:03.046 --> 14:04.888
It would have
destroyed everything

14:04.904 --> 14:08.306
had Krona not managed to
banish it to another dimension.

14:08.459 --> 14:10.448
Yeah, been there,
escaped that.

14:10.465 --> 14:13.767
The Anti-Monitor ate that
entire Universe for breakfast.

14:13.835 --> 14:16.370
And now it's loose in ours.

14:29.684 --> 14:33.654
Watch his bloody boots...
What is it doing to the maelstrom?

14:33.722 --> 14:35.155
Eating it.

14:35.223 --> 14:40.428
This is nothing but another weapon
the Guardians have built to destroy us!

14:40.495 --> 14:45.028
Look at that thing, Zox.
It's eating the maelstrom!

14:45.029 --> 14:47.135
If the Guardians were using it
to attack your people,

14:47.202 --> 14:49.592
you'd already be chewed up
and digested.

14:49.623 --> 14:51.883
[beeping] Warning...

14:51.914 --> 14:55.877
Apparently the Anti-Monitor
has detected my long-range burst scan.

14:55.945 --> 14:58.545
- Uh, Hal...?
- Don't freak out.

14:58.613 --> 15:00.551
That doesn't mean he saw us.

15:05.422 --> 15:08.098
Pretty sure he saw us.

15:19.614 --> 15:22.775
Manhunters! Attacking me!
Get us out of here!

15:22.799 --> 15:26.221
Calm yourself, Zox! We are
in as much danger as you.

15:26.257 --> 15:31.327
- Who cares if you're in danger?
- 2814, get us away from here immediately.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.811
Aya, initiate emergency
<i>ultra warp</i>.

15:33.828 --> 15:36.653
Initiating. However,
even ignoring safety protocols,

15:36.690 --> 15:39.872
I will require four minutes
to prime the impellers.

15:45.875 --> 15:49.439
Come on, boys, everybody out. We've got
to hold them off until Aya's ready.

15:49.469 --> 15:54.639
- Want to help, Zox?
- Not so much.

15:57.366 --> 15:58.726
<i>Razer...</i>

16:00.973 --> 16:02.663
Be careful.

16:08.702 --> 16:11.300
Stay together.
Hold 'em off and thin 'em out.

16:11.329 --> 16:13.002
Right behind you.

16:59.988 --> 17:02.270
Time to leave this party!

17:05.713 --> 17:09.310
Come on, kid, we're moving out.
The ship should be ready to go by now.

17:21.845 --> 17:23.355
Inopportune...

17:29.417 --> 17:31.476
Very inopportune.

17:37.784 --> 17:42.337
Razer is in trouble.
He requires immediate assistance.

17:42.383 --> 17:47.170
- No! He's dying for a better cause.
- I forbid you to leave.

18:05.148 --> 18:07.949
- Where's Red?
- He was right behind us.

18:07.977 --> 18:09.921
He's out there,
cut off from the Interceptor.

18:09.952 --> 18:13.311
Your A.I. has gone after him
against my direct orders.

18:13.337 --> 18:15.928
A traitor and a glitchy robot.
I say leave them.

18:15.954 --> 18:18.071
No! We're going back.

18:18.087 --> 18:22.724
Hal Jordan, I order you to fly
this ship out of here this instant!

18:22.785 --> 18:26.989
Not without my teammates.
Kilowog, give me some cover fire.

18:27.141 --> 18:29.048
I'm on it, Jordan.

18:39.648 --> 18:41.000
[grunting]

19:00.802 --> 19:02.735
Scan for Razer and Aya.

19:26.157 --> 19:29.769
- You came back for me.
- Always.

19:32.235 --> 19:34.822
Got a lock on their position.
Let's move!

19:59.537 --> 20:03.396
Aya!
[Aya screaming]

20:05.831 --> 20:07.097
No!

20:08.057 --> 20:09.367
Aya...

20:10.727 --> 20:12.928
I will fly you back
to the Interceptor.

20:12.948 --> 20:19.531
Too late, Razer.
Only 29.5 seconds of existence remain.

20:19.558 --> 20:21.492
Download yourself to the ship!

20:21.545 --> 20:25.342
Impossible.
Distance too great.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.411
Aya... Don't go.

20:29.601 --> 20:31.189
I love you.

20:31.634 --> 20:33.653
I love you, Aya.

20:35.483 --> 20:36.938
Razer...

20:38.640 --> 20:43.156
I... I now understand
the meaning of regret.

20:43.179 --> 20:46.614
We... we never...

21:11.703 --> 21:12.933
Now!

21:17.595 --> 21:19.016
No...!

21:24.831 --> 21:27.831
