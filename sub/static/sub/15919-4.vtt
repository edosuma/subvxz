00:08.500 --> 00:09.917
- (Mary Jane)
- Previously on Being Mary Jane.

00:09.921 --> 00:11.355
You have two kids

00:11.356 --> 00:12.790
by two different men,

00:12.792 --> 00:14.457
and neither one of 'em

00:14.458 --> 00:16.397
is here to pack

00:16.398 --> 00:18.332
your ungrateful behind up.

00:18.333 --> 00:19.790
How is Niecy?

00:19.792 --> 00:21.210
(Mary Jane)

00:21.211 --> 00:22.625
She's exercising

00:19.792 --> 00:22.624
and eating healthy.

00:22.625 --> 00:24.480
Amy Robach had a mammogram

00:24.481 --> 00:26.332
on live TV.

00:26.333 --> 00:28.291
- (Kara) - I think you should go
- Through the process

00:28.292 --> 00:29.249
Of freezing your eggs.

00:29.251 --> 00:30.373
I'll do it.

00:30.375 --> 00:31.792
- Do you know
- where I can get a drink?

00:31.795 --> 00:32.938
You know what,

00:32.939 --> 00:34.081
pick a desk.

00:34.083 --> 00:35.123
I know where the cups are.

00:35.125 --> 00:36.209
We should get

00:36.210 --> 00:37.290
Sheldon DeWitt on.

00:37.291 --> 00:39.458
- (Kara) - He hasn't given an interview
- To anybody, not print

00:39.461 --> 00:40.500
Or otherwise.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.333
- (Cameron) - Hey, you remember when we used
- To come back here

00:44.336 --> 00:45.790
Back in the day?

00:45.792 --> 00:48.665
We used to destroy these wings.

00:48.667 --> 00:50.498
You still come in here?

00:50.500 --> 00:52.458
Nope, no reason to.

00:56.583 --> 00:58.584
Hey, uh, saw that picture

00:58.585 --> 01:00.582
that you posted of Treyvion.

01:00.583 --> 01:02.252
Man, he is getting big.

01:02.253 --> 01:03.916
Whoo!

01:03.917 --> 01:05.750
- Even got that little
- lopsided head like me.

01:05.754 --> 01:07.250
Cameron, why am I here?

01:09.875 --> 01:12.081
Thought we needed to talk.

01:12.083 --> 01:14.083
- Oh, I don't have anything
- to say.

01:14.086 --> 01:15.209
I haven't heard from you

01:15.210 --> 01:16.332
in two years.

01:16.333 --> 01:19.081
A year.

01:19.083 --> 01:21.022
But, look,

01:21.023 --> 01:22.957
I-I really want to change that.

01:22.959 --> 01:24.021
No, you mean,

01:24.022 --> 01:25.081
vis-à-vis, your mom.

01:25.083 --> 01:26.188
Look, I lost

01:26.189 --> 01:27.290
my scholarship at UF.

01:27.291 --> 01:29.896
So now I'm just, you know,

01:29.897 --> 01:32.498
back in the city, just,

01:32.500 --> 01:33.832
you know, seeing what's what.

01:33.834 --> 01:35.083
- And there's no way
- your parents aren't

01:35.086 --> 01:36.417
- Gonna send you back
- to Florida?

01:36.420 --> 01:37.625
- No.
- No, no, no, no.

01:37.629 --> 01:39.083
- Kendra's
- about to graduate high school,

01:39.086 --> 01:40.334
So they're just

01:40.335 --> 01:41.582
scraping up all the money

01:41.583 --> 01:43.207
to put it towards that.

01:43.208 --> 01:45.855
It's just cheaper

01:45.856 --> 01:48.498
for me to stay in Georgia.

01:48.500 --> 01:49.813
Well, I'm sure

01:49.814 --> 01:51.123
they'll find a way.

01:51.125 --> 01:53.083
- Things always work out for you,
- don't they?

01:59.125 --> 02:01.083
- (Helen)
- Where is Niecy?

02:01.086 --> 02:02.397
Bet she's out, isn't she?

02:02.398 --> 02:03.707
Hm.

02:03.709 --> 02:04.916
Probably getting pregnant again.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.207
She's out with a girlfriend,

02:06.208 --> 02:08.083
- and I told you
- I agreed to babysit, Mom.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.875
- (Helen)
- You only think you agreed.

02:09.878 --> 02:11.415
She played you.

02:11.417 --> 02:12.540
She did not play me,

02:12.542 --> 02:14.375
- and please stop
- using PJ's old slang.

02:14.378 --> 02:15.624
Child, please.

02:15.625 --> 02:17.168
I got that from Kathie Lee

02:17.169 --> 02:18.707
and Hoda Kody.

02:18.709 --> 02:20.582
It's Hoda Kotb.

02:20.583 --> 02:22.248
That's what I said.

02:22.250 --> 02:23.540
Huh.

02:23.542 --> 02:25.624
Baby, stay close, okay?

02:25.625 --> 02:26.832
Don't get too close to the edge.

02:26.834 --> 02:28.498
What's Treyvion doing now,

02:28.500 --> 02:30.081
bouncing off the walls again?

02:30.083 --> 02:32.376
Now I swear, she had him

02:32.377 --> 02:34.665
on an all-sugar diet,

02:34.667 --> 02:37.790
thinking it's a food group.

02:37.792 --> 02:39.083
- When are you
- and Niecy gonna make up?

02:39.086 --> 02:40.458
- Because you
- clearly miss her,

02:40.462 --> 02:42.083
- 'Cause you can't stop talking
- about her.

02:42.086 --> 02:43.373
I haven't mentioned her once.

02:43.375 --> 02:45.542
- You keep bringing her up.
- Okay, Mom.

02:45.545 --> 02:47.373
But to answer your question,

02:47.375 --> 02:49.355
we'll make up when that child

02:49.356 --> 02:51.332
can learn some respect.

02:51.333 --> 02:53.292
When she first moved in here,

02:53.293 --> 02:55.248
she cooked all the time.

02:55.250 --> 02:57.418
Next thing I know,

02:57.419 --> 02:59.582
everybody's cooking for her.

02:59.583 --> 03:01.334
Had the nerve

03:01.335 --> 03:03.081
to get smart with me

03:03.083 --> 03:05.125
- when I told her to get up
- off the couch

03:05.128 --> 03:06.272
And take a walk

03:06.273 --> 03:07.415
around the block.

03:07.417 --> 03:08.665
You are so wrong.

03:08.667 --> 03:10.417
- Mom, you're wrong,
- and you're nuts,

03:10.420 --> 03:12.375
- And you need to put some extra
- money in the collection plate.

03:12.378 --> 03:13.624
The truth won't be heard

03:13.625 --> 03:14.855
'cause people

03:14.856 --> 03:16.081
don't want to hear it.

03:16.083 --> 03:17.624
The truth is,

03:17.625 --> 03:19.792
- Niecy has actually been taking
- really good care of herself.

03:19.795 --> 03:21.582
She's exercising.

03:21.583 --> 03:22.584
She's drinking water.

03:22.585 --> 03:25.207
No more fried foods.

03:25.208 --> 03:27.749
[chuckling]

03:27.750 --> 03:31.373
To hear you tell it.

03:31.375 --> 03:32.875
- Auntie.

03:32.876 --> 03:34.373
- Lord have mercy.

03:34.375 --> 03:36.083
- (Cameron)
- Hey, hey, come on. Tell me.

03:36.086 --> 03:37.917
- Do you remember that one year
- I let my hair grow out?

03:37.921 --> 03:39.208
- Mm-hmm.
- You remember.

03:39.212 --> 03:40.625
- And then you hooked me up
- with the cornrows.

03:40.629 --> 03:41.874
[laughs]

03:41.875 --> 03:43.917
- Yeah.
- You thought you were hard.

03:43.921 --> 03:45.081
Oh, come on.

03:45.083 --> 03:46.665
You told me that I looked good.

03:46.667 --> 03:47.814
Yeah, well, my braids

03:47.815 --> 03:48.957
were on point,

03:48.959 --> 03:50.230
but you,

03:50.231 --> 03:51.498
on the other hand, were corny.

03:51.500 --> 03:52.417
- Corny!
- Corny.

03:52.420 --> 03:53.458
- Me?
- Yes.

03:53.462 --> 03:54.750
- Corny.
- Yes.

03:54.754 --> 03:56.458
Now I know you tripping.

04:04.458 --> 04:05.498
Hey, you cool?

04:05.500 --> 04:08.081
Yeah, I'm cool.

04:08.083 --> 04:09.334
I just can't eat

04:09.335 --> 04:10.582
like this anymore.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.625
I'm trying to do better.

04:14.917 --> 04:16.334
Well, look, I'm the one

04:16.336 --> 04:17.749
that got you eating like this,

04:17.750 --> 04:18.981
so let me help you get back,

04:18.982 --> 04:20.207
all right?

04:20.208 --> 04:22.583
- Starting Monday, we gonna start
- hitting the farmer's market,

04:22.587 --> 04:23.916
Start hitting the gym.

04:23.917 --> 04:26.207
We gonna look good in no time.

04:26.208 --> 04:27.790
"We"?

04:27.792 --> 04:30.957
Cameron, there is no we.

04:30.959 --> 04:33.126
There's you,

04:33.127 --> 04:35.290
and then there's me.

04:35.291 --> 04:36.751
All right, listen,

04:36.752 --> 04:38.207
I-I-I get it, okay?

04:38.208 --> 04:40.125
- I missed out on a lot
- while I was at school

04:40.128 --> 04:41.542
And you was here holding

04:41.543 --> 04:42.957
it down, but listen, listen.

04:42.959 --> 04:45.749
I'm back, okay?

04:45.750 --> 04:47.291
- And I want to be involved
- with Treyvion.

04:47.295 --> 04:48.707
Treyvion doesn't know you.

04:48.709 --> 04:50.123
You left.

04:50.125 --> 04:51.604
All right, look,

04:51.605 --> 04:53.081
don't start with this again.

04:53.083 --> 04:54.147
You can't just pick up

04:54.148 --> 04:55.207
where you left off.

04:55.208 --> 04:56.665
It doesn't work like that.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.081
All right.

04:58.083 --> 04:59.272
So what are you...

04:59.273 --> 05:00.457
what are you saying?

05:00.458 --> 05:02.292
I'm saying that I'm very clear

05:02.293 --> 05:04.123
about where we stand,

05:04.125 --> 05:05.875
- and you don't need to try
- to get at me,

05:05.879 --> 05:07.874
Because this isn't about us.

05:07.875 --> 05:11.457
This is about our son.

05:11.458 --> 05:12.790
All right, cool.

05:12.792 --> 05:14.332
I'm glad we're being honest,

05:14.333 --> 05:15.543
because I thought that I had

05:15.544 --> 05:16.749
to get in good with you

05:16.750 --> 05:19.207
so that I could see Treyvion.

05:19.208 --> 05:20.209
Well, you don't.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.832
All right, cool.

05:27.834 --> 05:29.147
But it is... it is good

05:29.148 --> 05:30.457
to see you again.

05:30.458 --> 05:32.290
You look good.

06:13.627 --> 06:14.790
- Quiet night.

06:14.792 --> 06:16.980
My supervisor

06:16.981 --> 06:19.165
let me sneak out, so.

06:19.166 --> 06:20.834
- But you don't have
- to do too much tonight.

06:20.837 --> 06:22.542
I fed her and bathed her,

06:22.543 --> 06:24.248
and she just go on fell asleep.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.918
- So...

06:25.919 --> 06:27.582
- You let her fall asleep?

06:27.583 --> 06:29.540
But she is on a new schedule.

06:29.542 --> 06:30.916
Niecy didn't tell me.

06:30.917 --> 06:32.293
I'm sorry.

06:32.294 --> 06:33.665
I thought babies needed sleep.

06:33.667 --> 06:36.083
- If it's a problem, you know,
- she can just stay here with me.

06:36.086 --> 06:37.415
Oh, no, no, no.

06:37.417 --> 06:39.290
Thank you.

06:39.291 --> 06:41.749
I want my time too.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.542
- Isabelle needs to know
- both sides of her family.

06:43.545 --> 06:45.248
I agree. I agree.

06:45.250 --> 06:49.081
So how's Dante doing?

06:49.083 --> 06:51.272
My son is staying

06:51.273 --> 06:53.457
with my brother for now.

06:53.458 --> 06:54.707
Yeah, Niecy told me.

06:54.709 --> 06:56.314
I hope the Philippines

06:56.315 --> 06:57.916
can fix him.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.501
I did not come to this country

06:59.502 --> 07:01.083
to be poor, did I?

07:02.667 --> 07:04.458
- Did you know
- he got another girl pregnant?

07:04.462 --> 07:05.624
She's due in two months.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.540
Niecy did mention that.

07:07.542 --> 07:09.001
Guess Isabelle

07:09.002 --> 07:10.457
has another sibling.

07:10.458 --> 07:11.626
This is no way to bring

07:11.627 --> 07:12.790
a child into this world.

07:12.792 --> 07:14.230
Whatever happened to love,

07:14.231 --> 07:15.665
then marriage, then babies?

07:15.667 --> 07:17.543
Huh? People don't take time

07:17.544 --> 07:19.415
to do things the right way.

07:19.417 --> 07:21.459
- Sometimes you can't control
- how things happen.

07:21.462 --> 07:22.665
Yes, you can.

07:22.667 --> 07:24.083
It's called abstinence.

07:26.750 --> 07:29.063
Let's see if we can get

07:29.064 --> 07:31.373
you back on your schedule, huh?

07:31.375 --> 07:32.874
Bye-bye, Belle.

07:32.875 --> 07:34.667
- Bye-bye,
- Belle.

07:34.670 --> 07:36.083
Bye.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.498
Oh, no, no, no, baby.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.665
Not you. Not you.

07:40.667 --> 07:42.458
- I'm sorry. Wait, wait.
- I know.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.248
I know. I know.

07:44.250 --> 07:46.166
- But we're gonna
- do something fun now.

07:46.170 --> 07:47.792
- What do you want to do?
- Whatever you want to do.

07:47.795 --> 07:50.081
What do you want to do?

07:50.083 --> 07:51.355
No, I'm not a fan

07:51.356 --> 07:52.624
of Mary Jane Paul.

07:52.625 --> 07:54.081
She's kind of arrogant.

07:54.083 --> 07:55.540
She doesn't report the facts...

07:55.542 --> 07:57.081
more her opinion...

07:57.083 --> 07:58.500
- and she thinks this is
- a fashion show.

07:58.503 --> 07:59.832
I don't know.

07:59.834 --> 08:02.207
She's just not relatable,

08:02.208 --> 08:03.209
and I don't see myself

08:03.210 --> 08:04.208
in any of her stories.

08:04.210 --> 08:06.083
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, me either.

08:08.583 --> 08:10.248
What the hell is this?

08:10.250 --> 08:11.709
We're conducting focus groups

08:11.710 --> 08:13.165
in key demos on all our shows.

08:13.166 --> 08:15.457
This one's in Las Vegas.

08:15.458 --> 08:17.250
- Don't worry.
- It's not all bad.

08:17.253 --> 08:19.208
- But we only do this
- when there's a problem.

08:19.212 --> 08:20.498
Not necessarily.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.668
So far, Mark's show

08:21.669 --> 08:22.832
is in good shape.

08:22.834 --> 08:24.166
- He's built
- a strong male audience,

08:24.170 --> 08:25.207
Thanks to you.

08:25.208 --> 08:26.665
Okay.

08:26.667 --> 08:28.667
- And Cynthia still has
- the strongest female viewership.

08:28.670 --> 08:31.081
What about Mary Jane?

08:31.083 --> 08:32.272
What exactly are you trying

08:32.273 --> 08:33.457
to figure out here, Greg?

08:33.457 --> 08:34.980
Bottom line, our demos are

08:34.981 --> 08:36.498
lowest with Hispanic viewers,

08:36.500 --> 08:38.332
- and with the presidential
- election coming up,

08:38.337 --> 08:40.082
- We need to shore up
- that market.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.582
Now, they were a major part

08:41.583 --> 08:43.081
in the 2012 election.

08:43.082 --> 08:44.667
- It's gonna
- be even bigger in 2016.

08:44.670 --> 08:46.439
You know what, we have got

08:46.440 --> 08:48.207
to stop chasing these trends.

08:48.208 --> 08:49.438
Whatever happened

08:49.439 --> 08:50.665
to reporting great news

08:50.667 --> 08:52.147
and trusting that our audience

08:52.148 --> 08:53.624
is gonna stick with us?

08:53.625 --> 08:55.332
Everybody loves Mary Jane,

08:55.333 --> 08:56.373
and her numbers are steady.

08:56.375 --> 08:57.291
Steady...

08:57.293 --> 08:58.959
- Yes.
- But not rising.

08:58.962 --> 09:01.083
- And she has the biggest contract
- of a lot of other talent.

09:01.086 --> 09:02.126
- Oh, come on.

09:02.127 --> 09:03.165
- It's not me, Kara.

09:03.166 --> 09:04.750
- It's coming from marketing
- and ad sales.

09:04.752 --> 09:05.832
Well, what are you saying?

09:05.834 --> 09:07.248
That if she doesn't test well,

09:07.250 --> 09:09.167
she might lose her time slot

09:09.168 --> 09:11.081
or her job altogether?

09:11.083 --> 09:13.208
- I want Mary Jane
- here just as much as you do,

09:13.212 --> 09:14.938
But nothing can be done

09:14.939 --> 09:16.665
until all the data is in.

09:16.667 --> 09:18.083
- Plus, it would just get
- her worked up

09:18.084 --> 09:19.082
Over what could be nothing.

09:19.084 --> 09:20.498
Oh, no, no, no, no.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.125
- It would show on the air,
- and that would not help her.

09:22.128 --> 09:23.709
- Are you actually suggesting
- that I keep this from her?

09:23.712 --> 09:25.291
- Really?
- I'm expecting you to.

09:25.295 --> 09:27.500
- Oh.
- There is nothing to tell her.

09:27.503 --> 09:29.083
- Then why are you
- telling me this, Greg?

09:29.086 --> 09:30.750
- Well, maybe we
- can help her with the demos,

09:30.754 --> 09:32.793
But this information

09:32.794 --> 09:34.832
was given to you in confidence.

09:34.834 --> 09:36.085
I expect it to stay

09:36.086 --> 09:37.333
in confidence.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.665
This is wrong.

09:41.667 --> 09:43.417

Gael, what are you doing here?

09:57.460 --> 09:59.081
Lunch, remember?

09:59.083 --> 10:00.272
I didn't see you downstairs,

10:00.273 --> 10:01.457
so I came up.

10:01.458 --> 10:03.001
Well, you should've called

10:03.002 --> 10:04.540
'cause today is a crazy day.

10:04.542 --> 10:09.207
Oh. This might help.

10:09.208 --> 10:10.707
Oh.

10:10.709 --> 10:11.960
We finished off your bottle,

10:11.961 --> 10:13.207
so I wanted to replace it.

10:13.208 --> 10:14.959
Well, you didn't have

10:14.960 --> 10:16.707
to do that, but thank you.

10:16.709 --> 10:18.460
I can't do lunch, but I can do

10:18.461 --> 10:20.207
dinner tomorrow night.

10:20.208 --> 10:21.418
- Do you have a minute?

10:21.419 --> 10:22.624
- Hey, yeah, sure.

10:22.625 --> 10:24.290
Mary Jane, this is Gael.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.624
Gael, Mary Jane.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.332
Oh, I heard great things.

10:27.333 --> 10:30.332
You as well.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.147
I... I appreciate how you

10:32.148 --> 10:33.957
keep immigration reform front

10:33.959 --> 10:36.081
and center.

10:36.083 --> 10:37.582
And that Vargas piece,

10:37.583 --> 10:38.897
that was a refreshing

10:38.898 --> 10:40.207
perspective on a subject

10:40.208 --> 10:41.498
that's very close to me.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.041
- Well, you know
- with the election coming up,

10:43.045 --> 10:44.834
- We will be covering
- immigration reform quite a bit,

10:44.837 --> 10:46.665
So please keep watching.

10:46.667 --> 10:47.875
- Definitely.
- I will.

10:47.879 --> 10:49.458
- Yep.
- Yep, yep, yep, yep.

10:49.462 --> 10:50.606
Listen, we really

10:50.607 --> 10:51.749
have to get back to it.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.459
So I-I'm sorry that,

10:53.460 --> 10:55.165
you know, I can't do lunch.

10:55.166 --> 10:56.271
Do you want to do dinner

10:56.272 --> 10:57.373
tomorrow?

10:57.375 --> 10:59.040
Absolutely.

10:59.041 --> 11:00.563
Okay.

11:00.564 --> 11:02.081
Nice to meet you.

11:02.083 --> 11:03.500
- Yeah.
- Oh, pleasure's all mine.

11:03.503 --> 11:05.083
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:09.709 --> 11:11.165
Girl, you got a good one.

11:11.166 --> 11:12.875
- Did you really need me,
- or were you just being nosy?

11:12.879 --> 11:14.083
- Nosy.
- Mm.

11:31.750 --> 11:32.772
- Oh, my God.

11:32.773 --> 11:33.790
- Oh!

11:33.792 --> 11:34.832
Auntie! Oh, my God.

11:34.834 --> 11:36.458
- Oh, my God,
- I'm so sorry.

11:36.462 --> 11:38.081
I'm so sorry.

11:38.083 --> 11:39.625
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Who-who is that?

11:39.629 --> 11:41.458
- It's-it's-it's-it's
- Treyvion's father.

11:41.462 --> 11:43.125
- Oh.
- It's Treyvion's dad.

11:43.128 --> 11:45.083
- (Niecy) - What are you doing?
- Get up! Get the hell up.

11:45.084 --> 11:46.458
- My clothes...
- My clothes are over there.

11:46.462 --> 11:47.875
- Oh, my God.
- I'm so sorry.

11:47.879 --> 11:49.583
- Oh, God.
- Where is Treyvion?

11:49.587 --> 11:52.460
He's... he's... he's with Naima

11:52.461 --> 11:55.332
and the... and... and the girls.

11:55.333 --> 11:57.081
I'm sorry, Auntie.

11:57.083 --> 11:58.083
I'm sorry.

11:58.084 --> 11:59.291
I'm sorry too.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.292
You had all the good stuff

12:11.293 --> 12:13.083
recorded on your DVR.

12:18.083 --> 12:20.167
We didn't even get

12:20.168 --> 12:22.248
under the covers.

12:22.250 --> 12:23.313
We just laid on top

12:23.314 --> 12:24.375
of the blanket.

12:28.333 --> 12:29.709
The duvet is the most

12:29.710 --> 12:31.083
expensive part.

12:32.834 --> 12:34.207
I'm sorry, Auntie.

12:34.208 --> 12:35.209
I...

12:38.625 --> 12:40.457

to sleep in my bed.

14:16.750 --> 14:18.624
Are you gonna kick us out?

14:18.625 --> 14:20.125
- No, I'm not gonna
- kick you out.

14:25.083 --> 14:27.415
Thank you so much, Auntie.

14:27.417 --> 14:29.022
And, look,

14:29.023 --> 14:30.624
I am so sorry about everything.

14:30.625 --> 14:33.043
And I promise that I will never

14:33.044 --> 14:35.457
disrespect your house

14:35.458 --> 14:37.665
like that again.

14:37.667 --> 14:39.542
Thank you.

14:44.166 --> 14:45.790
Are you tired of being sorry

14:45.792 --> 14:48.083
- and making promises
- that are hard for you to keep?

14:51.250 --> 14:54.665
Auntie, I made a mistake.

14:54.667 --> 14:56.834
- I know.
- You're always making mistakes.

14:56.837 --> 14:58.334
My question is,

14:58.335 --> 14:59.832
are you tired of it?

14:59.834 --> 15:01.626
'Cause here I am thinking, "Wow,

15:01.627 --> 15:03.415
Niecy is really getting her life

15:03.417 --> 15:04.750
together," and then you go

15:04.751 --> 15:06.081
and pull a stunt like that.

15:06.083 --> 15:07.834
- But it's not like
- it was somebody random.

15:07.837 --> 15:09.957
It was Treyvion's father.

15:09.959 --> 15:11.626
We're using that term "father"

15:11.627 --> 15:13.290
pretty loosely.

15:13.291 --> 15:15.332
Baby, you are never going

15:15.333 --> 15:17.438
to attract more than

15:17.439 --> 15:19.542
how you feel about yourself.

15:21.208 --> 15:22.480
You're always trying

15:22.481 --> 15:23.749
to be deep.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.749
Look, Cameron's back.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.208
- He wants to be
- in his son's life,

15:28.212 --> 15:29.230
But he has to show me

15:29.231 --> 15:30.248
that he's serious first.

15:30.250 --> 15:32.001
How?

15:32.002 --> 15:33.749
By sleeping with you?

15:33.750 --> 15:35.332
I love you.

15:35.333 --> 15:38.127
Baby, I do, but your life

15:38.128 --> 15:40.916
cannot revolve around a dude.

15:40.917 --> 15:42.626
There's more to life

15:42.627 --> 15:44.332
than men and kids.

15:44.333 --> 15:46.627
Like what, freezing your eggs

15:46.628 --> 15:48.916
and drinking tequila?

15:48.917 --> 15:50.373
Excuse me, little girl?

15:50.375 --> 15:53.626
Oh, no, you made it very clear

15:53.627 --> 15:56.874
that I'm a big girl.

15:56.875 --> 15:58.957
And since we're talking truth,

15:58.959 --> 16:00.917
- let's talk
- about the empty tequila bottles

16:00.921 --> 16:02.291
- That I found
- under your bathroom sink.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.334
Wait, wait. You've been

16:03.335 --> 16:04.373
snooping around my house?

16:04.375 --> 16:06.457
I was looking for lotion.

16:06.458 --> 16:08.290
Ain't this about a blimp?

16:08.291 --> 16:10.250
- You used Treyvion to get Cameron
- to come over here,

16:10.253 --> 16:11.916
And I call you on it,

16:11.917 --> 16:13.335
and now you're trying to come

16:13.336 --> 16:14.749
at me sideways over a drink?

16:14.750 --> 16:16.417
So you can critique

As in, this may happen again?

25:12.834 --> 25:14.564
Everyone knows that you

25:14.565 --> 25:16.290
don't give interviews.

25:16.291 --> 25:19.207
You have never said why.

25:19.208 --> 25:20.415
Off the record?

25:20.417 --> 25:22.540
Off the record.

25:22.542 --> 25:24.498
I prefer the doing.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.458
- I do the work. I let
- other people talk about it.

25:26.462 --> 25:27.665
Oh, and they do.

25:27.667 --> 25:28.751
People speculate

25:28.752 --> 25:29.832
about your success,

25:29.834 --> 25:31.856
the cases you've won,

25:31.857 --> 25:33.874
your scruples as a businessman.

25:33.875 --> 25:36.291
- If people want to waste
- their time thinking about me,

25:36.295 --> 25:39.081
I have no problem with it.

25:39.083 --> 25:41.250
- So what made you change
- your mind about the interview?

25:41.253 --> 25:43.167
I mean, I'm assuming

25:43.168 --> 25:45.081
you're here for a reason.

25:45.083 --> 25:46.751
Well, really, it started

25:46.752 --> 25:48.415
with the Gifting Alliance.

25:48.417 --> 25:50.168
Like interviews, I had resisted

25:50.169 --> 25:51.916
the invitation for years.

25:51.917 --> 25:55.415
But I do want to give back.

25:55.417 --> 25:57.165
I was meditating this morning,

25:57.166 --> 25:58.501
and I came upon the realization

25:58.502 --> 25:59.832
that asking the wealthy

25:59.834 --> 26:02.959
to help my people was tantamount

26:02.960 --> 26:06.081
to passing out fish.

26:06.083 --> 26:08.582
I want my people to fish.

26:08.583 --> 26:09.707
You know, for so long,

26:09.709 --> 26:11.293
I was just fine

26:11.294 --> 26:12.874
with being the only one.

26:12.875 --> 26:15.106
Success in isolation

26:15.107 --> 26:17.332
fosters the...

26:17.333 --> 26:21.123
the lie of, "I'm special."

26:21.125 --> 26:22.917
- I know you must know
- what I'm talking about.

26:22.921 --> 26:24.375
- I would love
- to go there with you,

26:24.378 --> 26:25.751
But there are a lot

26:25.752 --> 26:27.125
of black women in my field.

26:30.500 --> 26:32.081
I'm not special.

26:32.083 --> 26:33.522
And just as you've pointed out,

26:33.523 --> 26:34.957
neither are you.

26:34.959 --> 26:36.373
What I did do

26:36.375 --> 26:38.729
was put all of my energy

26:38.730 --> 26:41.083
into making myself successful.

26:42.375 --> 26:44.897
But I didn't leave

26:44.898 --> 26:47.415
behind the playbook.

26:47.417 --> 26:48.564
Your show targets a lot

26:48.565 --> 26:49.707
of the audience

26:49.709 --> 26:51.332
that I'm trying to reach,

26:51.333 --> 26:54.647
and ten minutes of airtime

26:54.648 --> 26:57.957
could be a very powerful thing

26:57.959 --> 26:59.085
when you finally

26:59.086 --> 27:00.207
have something to say.

27:00.208 --> 27:01.415
Yeah.

27:01.417 --> 27:03.250
- It's great
- that you have an agenda

27:03.253 --> 27:05.397
And that you're interested

27:05.398 --> 27:07.540
in that platform.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.376
But, Mr. DeWitt, Talk Back

27:09.377 --> 27:11.207
isn't a messenger service.

27:11.208 --> 27:13.707
We can't cover those issues

27:13.709 --> 27:14.917
without addressing

27:14.918 --> 27:16.123
Sheldon DeWitt the man.

27:16.125 --> 27:17.522
People want to know more about

27:17.523 --> 27:18.917
your personal life, your work.

27:22.083 --> 27:24.208
- Just so we're clear, this
- is just the vetting process.

27:24.212 --> 27:25.290
Oh.

27:25.291 --> 27:27.083
- Before I agree to sit down
- with you,

27:27.086 --> 27:29.083
I just want to see

27:29.084 --> 27:31.081
what you're all about.

27:31.083 --> 27:34.415
Since we're being up-front,

27:34.417 --> 27:35.750
I would love

27:35.751 --> 27:37.081
to get an interview with you.

27:37.083 --> 27:38.751
I might even make

27:38.752 --> 27:40.415
some compromises,

27:40.417 --> 27:42.085
but not to the point where

27:42.086 --> 27:43.749
I feel like I'm being used.

27:43.750 --> 27:45.375
- Uh-oh,
- I may need the number

27:45.378 --> 27:46.729
Of one of those not-so-special

27:46.730 --> 27:48.083
black female anchors.

27:49.083 --> 27:50.083
Hm.

27:55.709 --> 27:57.208
- (Mary Jane) - This is what we
- Call the news pit.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.792
- It's... it's kind
- of quiet this time of night.

27:58.795 --> 28:00.500
- (Sheldon) - Yeah, it's not
- Exactly what you'd imagine

28:00.503 --> 28:02.624
Of your 24-hour news station.

28:02.625 --> 28:04.081
Yeah.

28:04.083 --> 28:05.583
To the right

28:05.584 --> 28:07.081
is our control room.

28:07.083 --> 28:08.583
So you've been here

28:08.584 --> 28:10.081
for three years?

28:10.083 --> 28:11.832
Gosh, has it been that long?

28:11.834 --> 28:12.856
Yeah.

28:12.857 --> 28:13.874
Yeah, I guess it has.

28:13.875 --> 28:15.168
And now you're in the process

28:15.169 --> 28:16.457
of freezing your eggs.

28:16.458 --> 28:17.668
Well, somebody's been

28:17.669 --> 28:18.874
watching my show.

28:18.875 --> 28:20.081
Mm-hmm.

28:20.083 --> 28:21.709
Yeah, uh, sort of felt

28:21.710 --> 28:23.332
like the right time.

28:23.333 --> 28:25.081
How's that?

28:25.083 --> 28:26.480
Like you,

28:26.481 --> 28:27.874
I've kind of had tunnel vision

28:27.875 --> 28:29.790
when it came to my career.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.126
This job has been

28:31.127 --> 28:32.457
my long-term relationship.

28:32.458 --> 28:33.832
Oh.

28:33.834 --> 28:35.291
- One day I woke up,
- and I wanted more.

28:35.295 --> 28:37.563
I wanted marriage and kids

28:37.564 --> 28:39.834
and the whole happy cliché.

28:40.917 --> 28:42.147
Family dog,

28:42.148 --> 28:43.373
white picket fence.

28:43.375 --> 28:45.583
- Well, I had thought
- more of a sculptural fence,

28:45.585 --> 28:46.333
But, yeah, I'm open.

28:46.335 --> 28:47.832
Mm.

28:47.834 --> 28:49.001
But putting out there

28:49.002 --> 28:50.165
for everyone to see,

28:50.166 --> 28:52.123
that's a risky move.

28:52.125 --> 28:53.665
What's life without risks?

28:53.667 --> 28:54.939
True, but I usually reserve

28:54.940 --> 28:56.207
the risks for my business.

28:56.208 --> 28:57.418
I'm a bit more careful

28:57.419 --> 28:58.624
with my private life.

28:58.625 --> 29:00.250
- Well, yeah,
- no, I...

29:00.253 --> 29:01.834
- I wasn't sold
- on the whole egg freezing thing.

29:01.837 --> 29:02.959
My producer had to sell me

29:02.960 --> 29:04.081
on it.

29:04.083 --> 29:05.917
- But the support
- has been tremendous,

29:05.921 --> 29:07.189
And it's been

29:07.190 --> 29:08.457
an incredible journey.

29:08.458 --> 29:10.083
- The only downside
- is the insomnia.

29:10.086 --> 29:11.772
Oh, in my book,

29:11.773 --> 29:13.457
insomnia's a bonus.

29:13.458 --> 29:14.707
Business never sleeps.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.083
- Why should we?
- I don't know about you.

29:16.086 --> 29:17.878
- But I look
- a lot better with some sleep.

29:17.879 --> 29:19.980
If this is you without sleep,

29:19.981 --> 29:22.083
I'm not complaining.

29:24.625 --> 29:27.624
This is the top back set,

29:27.625 --> 29:29.418
and this is where you will sit

29:29.419 --> 29:31.207
when you do the interview.

29:31.208 --> 29:32.959
If I do the interview.

29:36.917 --> 29:37.957
[knocking]

29:37.959 --> 29:39.458
- Yee-haw.
- [laughs] Yee-haw.

29:39.462 --> 29:40.792
Come in.

29:44.291 --> 29:45.292
Dinner's ready.

29:47.500 --> 29:48.665
We're not really hungry.

29:48.667 --> 29:50.081
We already ate.

29:50.083 --> 29:52.081
When?

29:52.083 --> 29:53.917
- We just had
- some leftover pizza

29:53.921 --> 29:56.005
- From when we hung out
- with Naima and the girls.

29:58.959 --> 30:00.917
- (Paul Sr.) - You knew I was gonna
- Pick her up last night.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.105
And you knew

30:02.106 --> 30:03.290
how I felt about it.

30:03.291 --> 30:05.625
- She's lucky she has those kids
- or her behind...

30:05.629 --> 30:06.790
She wouldn't be here.

30:06.792 --> 30:08.166
You won, okay.

30:09.542 --> 30:11.208
- All right.
- All right, thank you.

30:11.212 --> 30:13.166
- (Paul Sr.) - You know that girl
- Is in her room hiding?

30:13.169 --> 30:14.373
Say, "Thank you, Grandpa."

30:14.375 --> 30:15.959
- (Paul Sr.)
- Helen, this has got to stop.

30:15.962 --> 30:18.000
- You know,
- I'm tired of this foolishness.

30:18.003 --> 30:20.957
You win, okay?

30:20.959 --> 30:23.626
- Okay, these are the numbers that
- I need the calculations for.

30:23.629 --> 30:24.813
- Okay.

30:24.814 --> 30:25.998
- Okay? Tomorrow's show.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.125
- Yeah.
- Kara.

30:27.128 --> 30:28.665
So let... yeah?

30:28.667 --> 30:30.333
- Oh, yeah.
- I'll be right back.

30:30.337 --> 30:32.207
Yeah.

30:32.208 --> 30:33.500
- (Kara)
- Yeah?

30:36.792 --> 30:38.083
- I need your help.
- Oh.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.792
- We shooting up
- at the office now?

30:39.793 --> 30:40.750
Yeah, I tried to do it myself,

30:40.752 --> 30:42.165
and I got all freaked out.

30:42.166 --> 30:43.583
- So go ahead.
- All right, just tell me where.

30:43.587 --> 30:45.083
- Just right here,
- and just... ow! Mother...

30:45.086 --> 30:46.874
I'm sorry.

30:46.875 --> 30:48.438
I'm sorry,

30:48.439 --> 30:49.998
but you just got to do it.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.457
My mom has type one.

30:51.458 --> 30:53.000
- Been doing daily shots
- since I'm nine.

30:53.003 --> 30:54.333
- I used to have
- to give 'em to her,

30:54.335 --> 30:55.417
- And it used to scare the crap
- out of me.

30:55.418 --> 30:56.665
But now needles don't faze me.

30:56.667 --> 30:57.998
Clearly.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.874
You're gonna be okay.

31:01.875 --> 31:03.333
- What are you
- gonna do tonight?

31:03.337 --> 31:04.834
- What else am I gonna do?
- Work.

31:04.837 --> 31:06.625
- Don't say it
- like you don't love it.

31:06.629 --> 31:08.248
Something to do, girl.

31:08.250 --> 31:10.498
I want to have a drink.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.959
- But, you know,
- with the shots and everything...

31:12.962 --> 31:14.415
Want to get something to eat?

31:14.417 --> 31:15.665
Yeah, sure.

31:15.667 --> 31:17.043
I... let me just finish up...

31:17.044 --> 31:18.415
oh, shoot!

31:18.417 --> 31:20.081
What?

31:20.083 --> 31:22.375
- I was supposed
- to meet Gael for dinner tonight.

31:22.378 --> 31:23.729
- What time?

31:23.730 --> 31:25.081
- Like, five minutes ago.

31:25.083 --> 31:26.625
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'm gonna...

31:26.629 --> 31:28.083
- I'm just gonna cancel.
- No, no.

31:28.086 --> 31:29.875
- You're not gonna cancel.
- Yes. Yes.

31:29.879 --> 31:31.583
- You just bailed on him
- for lunch yesterday.

31:31.587 --> 31:33.252
Now you're gonna text him

31:33.253 --> 31:34.916
that you're on your way.

31:34.917 --> 31:37.457
You got to go.

31:37.458 --> 31:39.373
Yeah, I guess I should.

31:39.375 --> 31:40.916
All right.

31:40.917 --> 31:42.417
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
- What?

31:42.420 --> 31:45.123
Let me check your teeth.

31:45.125 --> 31:47.665
All right. Boobs.

31:47.667 --> 31:48.749
They're still there.

31:48.750 --> 31:49.916
Protection?

31:49.917 --> 31:51.084
I am not sleeping

31:51.085 --> 31:52.248
with him tonight.

31:52.250 --> 31:54.083
- Girl, please.
- What?

31:59.875 --> 32:01.165
You slutty ass.

32:01.166 --> 32:02.834
- Mm-hmm.
- You took it.

32:02.837 --> 32:04.749
What's that make you?

32:04.750 --> 32:06.415
[laughs]

32:06.417 --> 32:09.373
[soft music]

32:09.375 --> 32:17.375
♪ ♪

32:20.792 --> 32:21.875
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:21.879 --> 32:23.749
I'm meeting Gael Montoya here.

32:23.750 --> 32:25.083
- He's right over there.
- Back here?

32:25.086 --> 32:26.917
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

32:26.921 --> 32:28.501
(Kara)

32:28.502 --> 32:30.081
Oh, my gosh.

32:30.083 --> 32:31.583
- Where is he?
- Where is he?

32:31.587 --> 32:33.106
Oh, my gosh,

32:33.107 --> 32:34.624
I am so sorry.

32:34.625 --> 32:36.165
Oh, my goodness.

32:36.166 --> 32:38.457
I am so sorry... work stuff.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.123
Oh. But you got my text, right?

32:40.125 --> 32:41.290
I did.

32:41.291 --> 32:43.125
- Oh, goodness gracious.
- Craziness.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.083
- I just didn't know
- that running 15 minutes

32:45.086 --> 32:47.248
late really meant 45.

32:47.250 --> 32:48.500
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

32:48.503 --> 32:50.459
Your drink

32:50.460 --> 32:52.415
is probably watered down.

32:52.417 --> 32:55.832
Oh. Thank you.

32:55.834 --> 32:57.293
- Listen, I just want
- to apologize

32:57.295 --> 32:58.522
For not being myself

32:58.523 --> 32:59.749
the other day.

32:59.750 --> 33:02.916
I was just very stressed out,

33:02.917 --> 33:04.522
and you kind of caught

33:04.523 --> 33:06.123
me off guard

33:06.125 --> 33:07.355
when you just popped up

33:07.356 --> 33:08.582
at my job.

33:08.583 --> 33:11.583
No, we had plans.

33:12.792 --> 33:14.022
Well,

33:14.023 --> 33:15.248
they weren't set in stone.

33:15.250 --> 33:16.355
You had my name on a list

33:16.356 --> 33:17.457
with security.

33:17.458 --> 33:18.606
How do you think

33:18.607 --> 33:19.749
I got into the building?

33:19.750 --> 33:21.709
- Yeah,
- but you saw how busy I was,

33:21.712 --> 33:23.332
And instead of leaving,

33:23.333 --> 33:24.813
you decided to stand there

33:24.814 --> 33:26.290
and fawn all over my coworker

33:26.291 --> 33:27.626
saying how much

33:27.627 --> 33:28.957
you loved our immigration story.

33:28.959 --> 33:30.709
- I was just giving
- her a compliment.

33:30.712 --> 33:33.083
- Aye.
- Did you not produce that show?

33:33.086 --> 33:34.334
I've produced

33:34.335 --> 33:35.582
thousands of shows, Gael,

33:35.583 --> 33:36.855
but, of course,

33:36.856 --> 33:38.123
you would choose that one.

33:38.125 --> 33:40.083
- I get it.
- You're a proud Latino.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.582
Congratulations.

33:41.583 --> 33:44.290
What is that supposed to mean?

33:44.291 --> 33:45.624
Nothing.

33:45.625 --> 33:47.458
Nothing.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.355
I think the kitchen

34:03.356 --> 34:05.207
is going to close soon.

34:05.208 --> 34:07.792
Do you want to order something

34:07.793 --> 34:10.373
to eat, something else to drink?

34:10.375 --> 34:12.022
Can you just get the sarcasm

34:12.023 --> 34:13.665
out of your voice, please?

34:13.667 --> 34:15.188
- Please?

34:15.190 --> 34:16.706
- I'm simply stating fact.

34:16.708 --> 34:18.623
The place is about to close.

34:18.625 --> 34:20.206
I had to work.

34:20.208 --> 34:21.248
You could've texted.

34:21.250 --> 34:22.916
I did text you.

34:22.917 --> 34:24.751
I mean, when you knew you were

34:24.752 --> 34:26.581
going to be another 30 minutes,

34:26.583 --> 34:28.873
you could've let me know.

34:28.875 --> 34:30.606
You know what,

34:30.607 --> 34:32.331
I don't need this.

34:32.333 --> 34:33.665
I really don't.

34:33.667 --> 34:34.918
I don't need any more guilt

34:34.918 --> 34:36.165
in my life.

34:36.166 --> 34:37.646
If it's not my kids,

34:37.647 --> 34:39.123
it's my job.

34:39.125 --> 34:40.647
If it's not the dog,

34:40.648 --> 34:42.165
it's my ex.

34:42.166 --> 34:43.813
And I'm certainly not going

34:43.815 --> 34:45.456
to add you to my plate.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.956
I'm sorry.

34:48.958 --> 34:50.083
I have to go.

34:53.083 --> 34:54.833
Thank you.

35:04.375 --> 35:05.667
- Let's make your cranberry
- a real drink.

35:05.670 --> 35:07.250
- Oh, no, no, no.
- You know, I shouldn't.

35:07.253 --> 35:09.083
- Maybe you haven't heard.
- I'm freezing my eggs.

35:09.084 --> 35:10.084
Okay.

35:12.166 --> 35:13.167
So...

35:17.083 --> 35:18.459
Everybody's excited

35:18.460 --> 35:19.832
about your little special guest.

35:19.834 --> 35:22.874
So what's he like?

35:22.875 --> 35:23.898
- Surprisingly cool.

35:23.899 --> 35:24.916
- Mm-hmm.

35:24.917 --> 35:26.584
Easy to talk to,

35:26.585 --> 35:28.248
and I can't believe he is 52,

35:28.250 --> 35:29.688
never been married,

35:29.689 --> 35:31.123
and has no kids.

35:31.125 --> 35:33.375
- Hm.
- Think he's playing for my team?

35:33.378 --> 35:35.500
- If he is,
- he's batting well over 500.

35:35.503 --> 35:36.710
[laughs]

35:36.711 --> 35:37.916
That's all good.

35:37.917 --> 35:39.540
He's definitely handsome.

35:39.542 --> 35:41.792
- Definitely handsome, but
- the kind of money he's making?

35:41.795 --> 35:43.208
- Oh, yes,
- he is gorgeous, girl.

35:43.212 --> 35:44.874
Maybe I can introduce you.

35:44.875 --> 35:46.583
- Get you back in the game, huh?
- I don't know.

35:46.587 --> 35:47.625
- Oh, too soon.
- I'm sorry.

35:47.629 --> 35:49.332
Yeah.

35:49.333 --> 35:50.834
- I'm sorry. Gosh.
- Why, why? Why are you sorry?

35:50.837 --> 35:52.207
I feel bad.

35:52.208 --> 35:53.501
I feel like I just

35:53.502 --> 35:54.790
cheated on Eric.

35:54.792 --> 35:56.081
How's that going, by the way?

35:56.083 --> 35:57.707
[sighs]

35:57.709 --> 35:59.375
- I feel guilty.
- You know?

35:59.378 --> 36:00.415
He asked me not to call.

36:00.417 --> 36:01.790
He went to his brother's

36:01.792 --> 36:03.750
- so he could spend some time
- with his nephews.

36:03.754 --> 36:05.540
No, it's funny

36:05.542 --> 36:07.042
because he always thought I was

36:07.043 --> 36:08.540
gonna leave him for a black man,

36:08.542 --> 36:10.001
but I really never connected

36:10.002 --> 36:11.457
with the right one.

36:11.458 --> 36:13.373
Who you telling?

36:13.375 --> 36:15.457
[chuckling]

36:15.458 --> 36:17.542
- That's partially
- why he was jealous of you.

36:17.545 --> 36:19.231
You always got

36:19.232 --> 36:20.916
where I was coming from.

36:20.917 --> 36:22.001
He kind of felt

36:22.002 --> 36:23.081
like an outsider.

36:23.083 --> 36:25.291
- Well, I'm surprised marriage
- rates are as high as they are,

36:25.295 --> 36:26.460
Given how difficult it is

36:26.461 --> 36:27.624
for people

36:27.625 --> 36:29.582
to just really connect.

36:29.583 --> 36:31.231
That's exactly why the divorce

36:31.232 --> 36:32.874
rates are equally as high too.

36:32.875 --> 36:35.498
Right.

36:35.500 --> 36:38.290
So how are you?

36:38.291 --> 36:40.624
Lately,

36:40.625 --> 36:42.730
somewhere between okay

36:42.731 --> 36:44.832
and totally lost

36:44.834 --> 36:46.522
and happy I have a damn job

36:46.523 --> 36:48.207
to distract me.

36:48.208 --> 36:50.583
Oh, amen to that.

36:52.792 --> 36:55.498
Wow. You know what.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.207
It is getting late.

36:57.208 --> 36:58.376
Not that I have anyone

36:58.377 --> 36:59.540
to go home to,

36:59.542 --> 37:01.564
but isn't that

37:01.565 --> 37:03.582
sometimes the best?

37:03.583 --> 37:05.081
No.

37:05.083 --> 37:06.959
- How do you figure?
- You're home alone.

37:06.962 --> 37:08.165
You're by yourself.

37:08.166 --> 37:09.292
- Are you kidding me?

37:09.293 --> 37:10.415
- Sometimes.

37:10.417 --> 37:12.081
Never. Never.

37:12.083 --> 37:13.083
