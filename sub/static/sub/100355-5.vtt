WEBVTT

00:01.218 --> 00:04.091
- Previously
on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:04.134 --> 00:05.440
- Mick frickin' Rory.
Allie, remember?

00:05.483 --> 00:07.224
- She wasn't just some girl,
was she?

00:07.268 --> 00:08.399
- Remember
when we dented history?

00:08.443 --> 00:09.966
Your sister is the dent.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.533
Maybe her being here, she'll remember who she was.

00:11.576 --> 00:13.230
- How did you jailbreak
your way out of here?

00:13.274 --> 00:15.276
- I was poking around
your screens, and, suddenly,

00:15.319 --> 00:17.234
I knew how to hack my way out.

00:17.278 --> 00:20.716
- Astra and this
whole bloody mess is on me.

00:20.759 --> 00:23.066
She could continue
releasing souls indefinitely.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.285
- What happened here, John?

00:24.328 --> 00:26.156
- That witch
is Astra's dead mother.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.592
She's through there.

00:27.636 --> 00:29.203
Her spirit's waiting
on the other side

00:29.246 --> 00:32.858
of that door
and none too happy with me.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.742
John?

00:46.785 --> 00:48.526
- Blimey, he's really
cocked it up this time.

00:48.570 --> 00:50.528
- How could you let him
go in there?

00:50.572 --> 00:52.835
That thing is hurting him.

00:52.878 --> 00:56.317
- Then he probably deserves it.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.014
I can't just stand here.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.321
Being an apprentice means
never having to say,

01:00.364 --> 01:03.280
"Sorry I let you get killed
by a poltergeist."

01:03.324 --> 01:06.109
- Get your filthy paws off me!

01:08.764 --> 01:10.896
- No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:10.940 --> 01:12.333
- Move out of the way.

01:12.376 --> 01:14.639
-  Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

01:14.683 --> 01:17.425
- Yes. Maybe.

01:45.409 --> 01:48.717
- Oh, my God.

01:52.895 --> 01:54.201
John?

02:04.776 --> 02:08.302
- Aah!

02:17.746 --> 02:22.185
Oh, Gary, what have you done?

02:41.422 --> 02:43.641
- Sorry,
old assassin habits die hard.

02:43.685 --> 02:46.470
- Babe, now that you've given
me a heart attack,

02:46.514 --> 02:48.820
I was just about to jump in.
Care to join me?

02:48.864 --> 02:52.868
- Whoa, co-showering
in the communal bathroom--

02:52.911 --> 02:56.088
you are getting comfy,
which is a good thing

02:56.132 --> 02:58.874
because I'm gonna need you
to woman the ship.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.397
I've got business in Star City.

03:00.441 --> 03:02.225
- Is everything okay?

03:02.269 --> 03:03.661
- Yeah, it's just some stuff
I need to take care of,

03:03.705 --> 03:05.315
but it might take a few days,

03:05.359 --> 03:08.449
which is why I need
an interim captain.

03:09.319 --> 03:11.278
- Captain?
- Mm-hmm.

03:11.321 --> 03:12.670
- No, no, no, no, no.

03:12.714 --> 03:14.455
I was just starting to find
my footing as a Legend.

03:14.498 --> 03:15.891
Nobody likes the boss, babe.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.240
- They like me.

03:17.284 --> 03:19.155
- Yeah, because
you're cool Captain Lance.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.592
I'm just a button pusher
in a boring pantsuit.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.725
- Nah, babe,
just have fun with it.

03:23.768 --> 03:25.248
They are going to love you.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.249
- No.
- Yes.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.468
- No, no, no.

03:27.511 --> 03:29.252
- I miss you already,
Captain Pantsuit.

03:29.296 --> 03:30.732
- No, babe, I'm not--

03:41.046 --> 03:43.397
- Raise you two.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.312
- Make it ten.

03:45.355 --> 03:48.445
- Finally, a real hand.

03:51.492 --> 03:53.276
- She folds.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.669
- Like hell I do.

03:54.712 --> 03:57.454
Like hell you do.

03:59.848 --> 04:01.458
- What the hell are you doing?

04:01.502 --> 04:04.287
- Keeping us in the black.
You lost another account.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.028
First Rasputin, then Bugsy--

04:06.071 --> 04:08.726
- John Constantine--
- Now Meyers.

04:08.770 --> 04:11.599
Your little resurrection
venture is getting too risky.

04:11.642 --> 04:15.864
You turn the tide,
or you'll lose everything.

04:15.907 --> 04:18.823
- I've played nice long enough.

04:18.867 --> 04:21.565
Now it's time to play naughty.

04:29.312 --> 04:30.748
- That's one angry ghost.

04:30.792 --> 04:33.925
- Yeah, and now she's loose
in the bloody house.

04:33.969 --> 04:36.928
- What, that was Astra's mum?
- Yeah, her name is Natalie.

04:36.972 --> 04:38.713
- What did you do to her,
John boy?

04:38.756 --> 04:40.454
It was a long time ago.

04:40.497 --> 04:41.759
She was walking home late
from work,

04:41.803 --> 04:46.460
and some drunken idiot
blew a red light, and...

04:47.983 --> 04:51.073
Her husband, Alex, begged me
to bring her back.

04:51.116 --> 04:52.509
- You never told me that.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.729
- Yeah, well,
I never told anyone.

04:54.772 --> 04:58.298
Now, let's just say
that that night in Newcastle

04:58.341 --> 04:59.777
when we lost Astra,

04:59.821 --> 05:02.867
it was a little more
complicated than an exorcism.

05:05.566 --> 05:07.176
- Something tells me

05:07.219 --> 05:08.569
that you're not telling
the truth.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.135
- Look, I'm trying
to fix it, Nat, all right?

05:10.179 --> 05:12.573
I'm trying to save Astra.
Now help me.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.796
- Doesn't seem to be the answer
she was looking for.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.538
- The demon I summoned
brought Natalie back.

05:21.582 --> 05:24.236
- But if you brought her back,
why is she a ghost?

05:24.280 --> 05:26.543
- Because I botched it,
all right?

05:26.587 --> 05:28.893
I thought I had him
under control, but I didn't.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.984
You can't have her!
- John, get me out of here!

05:33.028 --> 05:34.551
- He took Astra.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.248
Natalie couldn't live
with herself knowing

05:36.292 --> 05:39.121
that the price of her life
was her daughter's.

05:39.164 --> 05:41.602
She killed herself
in this room.

05:41.645 --> 05:42.994
- That's so sa--

05:50.828 --> 05:54.266
- Doesn't look like Natalie's
done with you yet, John-o.

06:00.969 --> 06:02.753
- No, it looks like
Natalie wants to take me

06:02.797 --> 06:04.494
on a trip down memory lane.

06:08.629 --> 06:09.891
- All righty-tighty, then.

06:09.934 --> 06:12.197
You ready for the official
Waverider tour?

06:12.241 --> 06:13.590
- Hmm.

06:13.634 --> 06:14.809
- What would you like
to see first?

06:14.852 --> 06:16.376
- What do you people do
around here for fun?

06:16.419 --> 06:17.899
- If you could just
follow me this way,

06:17.942 --> 06:19.770
First stop, the galley.

06:19.814 --> 06:22.251
Gideon can whip up any kind
of food you can imagine.

06:22.294 --> 06:24.384
Last week, Nate and I
made cheddar biscuits

06:24.427 --> 06:26.734
and had her fabricate
some squeezable butter.

06:26.777 --> 06:29.824
That tasty treat has been
off the shelves since 2024.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.826
- She can make anything,
and you went

06:31.869 --> 06:33.610
with a discontinued condiment.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.047
Wait, can she make clothes?

06:36.091 --> 06:37.658
- Of course.

06:37.701 --> 06:38.876
- Okay, tell the computer
I need a dress

06:38.920 --> 06:40.791
for my perfume launch tonight.

06:40.835 --> 06:42.271
We'll be back in time
for that, right?

06:42.314 --> 06:44.360
- Yes. And, yes,
Gideon can do anything.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.101
She flies the ship,
makes our food,

06:46.144 --> 06:48.277
cleans the toilets,
tracks the timeline.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.888
- Tracks the time--

06:50.932 --> 06:53.543
Do you mean tells the future?

06:53.587 --> 06:58.069
Behrad, we could make billions
off future fall trend reports.

06:58.113 --> 07:00.071
No, no.

07:00.115 --> 07:01.638
Rule number one of time travel,

07:01.682 --> 07:03.553
never look into the future
for personal gain.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.033
- Totally, totally.

07:05.076 --> 07:07.514
- And rule number two,
no social media on the ship.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.647
I thought we were
dropping you off.

07:10.691 --> 07:12.649
- My brother,
the actual superhero...

07:12.693 --> 07:14.564
Invited me to stay.

07:14.608 --> 07:17.611
- Okay, let's just remember

07:17.654 --> 07:19.221
this is a place
of business, okay?

07:19.264 --> 07:21.310
We get called on a mission, you
need to keep out of our way.

07:21.353 --> 07:22.833
- Aye, aye.

07:22.877 --> 07:25.662
- Okay, we'll talk later.

07:25.706 --> 07:27.577
- Sad, what a waste
of a good head of hair.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.318
- Here you go.
Hide it.

07:29.361 --> 07:31.886
- Can your computer lady
make me some cucumber water?

07:31.929 --> 07:34.932
I'm parched
from that dry interaction.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.847
- She and her mom have been
living out of their car

07:36.891 --> 07:38.675
for almost a year,
and now her mom has

07:38.719 --> 07:40.460
a final-round job interview.

07:40.503 --> 07:41.852
- You are incredible.

07:41.896 --> 07:44.072
- I miss you,
but it feels pretty good

07:44.115 --> 07:45.595
to be out here helping people.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.642
- Out.
- Ah, it's okay.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.034
I have to go anyway.

07:50.078 --> 07:52.080
- Okay, uh, well, um,
I'll call you later.

07:52.123 --> 07:53.168
I love you.

07:54.561 --> 07:55.736
I'm--I'm sorry.

07:55.779 --> 07:58.129
I just kind of blurted
that out.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.696
- No, it's okay.
It's okay.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.524
You don't have to be sorry.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.570
I love you, too.

08:03.613 --> 08:04.962
- You do?
- I said "get out."

08:05.006 --> 08:06.398
- Okay, I'll call later.

08:06.442 --> 08:08.226
Bye.
- Okay.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.012
Mick, are you feeling
all right?

08:11.055 --> 08:13.318
- My stomach hurts.
I can't eat.

08:13.362 --> 08:14.798
I can't drink.

08:14.842 --> 08:17.801
I think Allie gave me an STD
back at the reunion.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.368
- Initiating scan.

08:22.023 --> 08:25.374
- Those are not symptoms.
Those are feelings.

08:25.417 --> 08:28.638
Mick, I think
you're developing a crush.

08:28.682 --> 08:31.641
- Is that when you whiz
and it hurts?

08:31.685 --> 08:34.688
- No, it's biology's way
of telling you

08:34.731 --> 08:36.603
you care about someone else

08:36.646 --> 08:37.952
- Dr. Palmer is correct.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.562
The results of my body scan
indicate

08:39.606 --> 08:42.130
that you do, in fact,
like like her.

08:44.654 --> 08:47.527
- Interim Captain Sharpe here,
team meeting in the parlor,

08:47.570 --> 08:49.180
over and out.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.574
Okay, that was good.
It was fun yet to the point.

08:51.618 --> 08:52.967
Not too--

08:53.010 --> 08:54.621
Gideon, are you
broadcasting this?

08:54.664 --> 08:56.884
- Sorry, Miss Sharpe,
I'll shut it down.

08:56.927 --> 08:59.495
- Okay, thank you, we women
have to stick together.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.149
- I always thought of you
as one of the guys.

09:01.192 --> 09:02.716
- Okay, I don't know
what that means.

09:02.759 --> 09:03.804
- He means
that as a compliment.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.022
- I do.
- Okay.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.763
- Hmm.
- That's for you.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.635
That's for you.

09:08.678 --> 09:10.201
- Okay, then.

09:10.245 --> 09:11.463
- Okay.

09:11.507 --> 09:12.856
What did I say about phones?

09:12.900 --> 09:16.251
- What? I need to tell
my boyfriend I'm not dead.

09:16.294 --> 09:17.600
- Uh, boyfriend?

09:17.644 --> 09:21.430
- Yep, internationally
renowned DJ S'more Money.

09:21.473 --> 09:22.692
- Ah, okay, we've got Ray.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.694
Uh, where's Mick?
- He's sick.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.609
Lovesick.
- Oh.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.350
- Oh, lei.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.961
- So while Sara's in Star City,
I wanted to introduce you all

09:31.005 --> 09:33.268
to something that I developed
at the Time Bureau.

09:33.311 --> 09:34.878
I know
what you're all thinking,

09:34.922 --> 09:36.706
Time Bureau, #stuffy.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.012
What can we learn
from those guys?

09:38.055 --> 09:39.840
But we really did have
a lot of fun over there.

09:39.883 --> 09:41.102
Do you remember
taco Mondays, Nate?

09:41.145 --> 09:43.365
- Yeah, those were
some wild taco times.

09:43.408 --> 09:44.671
- Yeah.
- Aloha?

09:44.714 --> 09:46.194
- Yes, A.L.O.H.A.

09:46.237 --> 09:50.241
It stands for assess, listen,
observe, hydrate...

09:50.285 --> 09:51.242
attack!

09:51.286 --> 09:52.243
- What the--

09:52.287 --> 09:53.723
- Cool.
- See?

09:53.767 --> 09:55.769
- Uh, how many pages is this?

09:55.812 --> 09:56.900
- Ava, you ever heard
the proverb

09:56.944 --> 09:58.685
"the fox knows many things,

09:58.728 --> 10:00.469
the hedgehog knows
one big thing"?

10:00.512 --> 10:01.818
- I have not.

10:01.862 --> 10:04.386
- Well, Legends, we're
a fox kind of organization.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.910
Adaptable, off the cuff.

10:06.954 --> 10:09.217
This--this is very hedgehog.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.523
Trying to impose
one way of doing things

10:11.567 --> 10:12.786
onto every situation.

10:12.829 --> 10:16.093
- And not to be rude--
is there a mission here?

10:16.137 --> 10:18.443
- No, I just--
- Okay, then, I'm gonna

10:18.487 --> 10:21.229
introduce Zari to the wonders
of Gideon's Austrian toast.

10:21.272 --> 10:23.274
- Actually, it's French toast.
- Ah...

10:23.318 --> 10:25.799
- Pretty sure it's Austrian.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.844
- Gideon, Gideon,
check the timeline.

10:27.888 --> 10:29.890
- It would appear
that there is a disturbance

10:29.933 --> 10:32.066
at the Bastille
in Paris, 1793.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.720
While the details
are still hazy,

10:33.763 --> 10:35.417
the aftermath is traumatic.

10:35.460 --> 10:38.289
Thousands die, and the
French Revolution collapses.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.683
- Well, looks like
we have a mission,

10:40.727 --> 10:42.946
so everybody stop looking
so "Les Misérables,"

10:42.990 --> 10:45.732
because we are going to France.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.693
Behrad, come on,
we need to move.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.615
- Hey, guys.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.009
- I couldn't stop her.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.663
She found the fabrication room.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.360
- Great.
She's not coming.

11:05.403 --> 11:06.970
- We don't do ride-alongs
in the field, B.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.885
- Ava, I can handle myself
in the field.

11:08.929 --> 11:10.887
I once played capture the flag
to raise awareness

11:10.931 --> 11:11.975
about feline OCD, so...

11:12.019 --> 11:13.498
- This isn't a PR event,
all right?

11:13.542 --> 11:14.761
We're walking into
a deadly situation

11:14.804 --> 11:16.327
facing an Encore
with unknown powers.

11:16.371 --> 11:19.330
I do not have time
to keep my eye on a party girl.

11:19.374 --> 11:20.505
- I do.

11:20.549 --> 11:21.768
- What?

11:21.811 --> 11:24.684
- I mean, come on, Ava,
what's the harm?

11:24.727 --> 11:27.208
- It's against protocol to
bring civilians into the field.

11:27.251 --> 11:28.688
- Tsk.
- Don't "tsk".

11:28.731 --> 11:29.863
- Tsk.

11:29.906 --> 11:32.692
- Yeah, but it
would be super cool

11:32.735 --> 11:35.172
if you just let me come anyway.

11:35.216 --> 11:38.175
- Uh, okay, fine.
- Yay.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.264
- Just, uh, make sure
you stay out of our way.

11:40.308 --> 11:43.267
- Yay!

11:45.835 --> 11:47.054
What the hell was that?

11:47.097 --> 11:48.838
- My signature perfume,
Dragonesque.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.187
I needed to do
something to help

11:50.231 --> 11:52.799
that extremely sad outfit.

11:52.842 --> 11:55.976
Spray, delay, walk away.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.455
- Okay, we're going this way.

11:57.499 --> 11:58.761
Jesus.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.763
- I was just doing
a runway turn.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.421
- This period in France
was called the Reign of Terror.

12:06.464 --> 12:09.206
Executions were
a national pastime.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.773
- Whoa!
- Ooh, yikes.

12:10.817 --> 12:13.776
- Yeah, we could definitely
be walking into a bloodbath.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.039
- And you want us
to go in there?

12:16.083 --> 12:17.998
- Yeah, that's our job.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.174
Excuse me, sir.

12:20.217 --> 12:23.133
Uh, we need to get in there.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.700
No.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.659
- It is of vital importance
that we get in there, sir.

12:27.703 --> 12:29.009
Please? Oh.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.662
- Stand back.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.926
- This isn't a club, Zari,
it's an execution.

12:32.969 --> 12:34.971
- An event is an event.

12:35.015 --> 12:36.843
Scoot.
Out of the way.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.105
- Where do you think
you're going?

12:38.148 --> 12:40.803
- Um, do you know
who you're talking to?

12:40.847 --> 12:41.848
What's your name?

12:41.891 --> 12:43.458
- Jean-Paul.

12:43.501 --> 12:45.590
- Très bien.
Now they'll know who to fire

12:45.634 --> 12:49.203
when they find out you left
Zari Tarazi standing outside.

12:49.246 --> 12:51.771
Un grand faux pas.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.468
- Not them.

12:53.511 --> 12:57.733
- Jean-Paul, my purse
isn't gonna walk in by itself.

12:59.387 --> 13:00.910
- Pshh.

13:09.484 --> 13:12.792
- Um, didn't you say
this was an execution?

13:12.835 --> 13:14.837
- Maybe Gideon got it wrong.

13:16.012 --> 13:17.405
- Well,
if they were misérables,

13:17.448 --> 13:19.015
they certainly aren't anymore.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.932
Stop with the thing.

13:29.199 --> 13:31.071
- You know, you can just say
the word,

13:31.114 --> 13:32.855
and I'll put you
in a prime spot uptown.

13:34.161 --> 13:35.379
So I can rub shoulders
with all those

13:35.423 --> 13:37.729
arrogant soul traders?
No, thank you.

13:37.773 --> 13:40.863
- I need some help with one
of the coins you constructed.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.691
- Help?

13:42.734 --> 13:45.868
When else do you come see me?

13:45.912 --> 13:49.045
I assume this
is why you're here?

13:49.089 --> 13:51.004
- How did you--

13:51.047 --> 13:53.571
John Constantine.

13:53.615 --> 13:56.052
I remember making this.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.056
What do you want for him?

14:00.100 --> 14:03.016
- Oh, I don't want
to trade him.

14:03.059 --> 14:04.104
I want to kill him.

14:09.065 --> 14:12.068
Tourist attraction number two.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.375
The night Alex begged me
to save Natalie.

14:14.418 --> 14:16.899
He was supposed to pick her up
that night she got hit,

14:16.943 --> 14:20.598
but they had a big fight,
so she walked.

14:20.642 --> 14:23.079
Alex was beside himself.
He was torn up.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.081
Astra, she hadn't said a word
since the accident.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.562
How was I supposed to say no?

14:31.392 --> 14:33.829
Alex begged me, but I knew
I should have said no.

14:36.223 --> 14:38.965
- Bollocks, John!
Come on, try again!

14:39.008 --> 14:42.011
- Alex wanted it, and I just
provided the how, all right?

14:42.055 --> 14:43.099
What's the difference, Nat?

14:43.143 --> 14:45.101
- So the resurrection was
your idea?

14:45.145 --> 14:46.711
- Yes, all right?

14:48.235 --> 14:50.106
- Nat and I,
we were best friends,

14:50.150 --> 14:52.848
How could I not try
and save her?

14:55.503 --> 14:59.115
- See?
The truth can set you free.

15:01.161 --> 15:05.382
-  ♪ I was on this
world when you went away ♪

15:05.426 --> 15:07.689
- Is that Mucous Membrane?

15:07.732 --> 15:09.996
- ♪ So clearly till this day

15:10.039 --> 15:11.954
♪ I don't want to do this

15:16.045 --> 15:17.786
- This place doesn't seem
too evil.

15:17.829 --> 15:20.180
- Yeah, well, appearances
can be deceiving, okay?

15:20.223 --> 15:21.398
We need to figure out
who this encore is

15:21.442 --> 15:22.965
and what powers they may have.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.098
We start with
the A.L.O.H.A. method, okay?

15:25.141 --> 15:27.143
Assessment, lay low,
don't engage.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.971
- We know how to party sneak.

15:29.015 --> 15:32.932
- Listen to me--you see
something, you say something.

15:34.411 --> 15:35.978
- Captain.
- Yeah.

15:36.022 --> 15:36.979
- You're trying too hard.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.155
It's really desperate.

15:45.945 --> 15:50.123
So this is your job?
Walking around parties?

15:50.166 --> 15:52.603
- Isn't this kind of
what you do?

15:52.647 --> 15:54.170
- Hmm, touché.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.042
No.

15:56.085 --> 15:59.001
- But something
definitely feels off.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.134
At this point
in the French Revolution,

16:01.177 --> 16:04.180
most of the royals had been
separated from their heads.

16:04.224 --> 16:07.009
Even wearing a nice dress could
get you sent to the guillotine.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.881
- Uh, and you let me
come out in this because...?

16:09.925 --> 16:12.188
- I'm sucker for a corset
and an updo.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.934
- Napoleon?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.805
- He should be marching
on southern France,

16:20.849 --> 16:21.806
not getting freaky.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.025
Wha--okay.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.245
Guys, steer clear.
Exercise extreme caution.

16:25.288 --> 16:28.117
- Relax, Ava.
- I'm trying.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.734
- Nora?

16:38.301 --> 16:41.130
- Ava, I think we found
our encore.

16:41.174 --> 16:42.914
She's in the VIP area.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.220
- Nora's our encore?

16:44.264 --> 16:46.222
- No, Ray,
that's Marie Antoinette.

16:46.266 --> 16:47.963
And she should definitely be
without her head by now.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.009
- Oh, great, on to phase two
of A.L.O.H.A.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.358
It's listening.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.055
Now, her powers
could be anything--

16:53.099 --> 16:54.926
teleportation, pyrokinesis.

16:54.970 --> 16:57.103
- Fatal attractiveness.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.844
- I mean...
both: Right?

17:00.976 --> 17:01.933
- Guys?

17:01.977 --> 17:03.109
Guys?

17:03.152 --> 17:04.414
They're not usually like this.

17:04.458 --> 17:06.199
- Well, you're not
usually captain.

17:06.242 --> 17:07.330
- Thank you.

17:07.374 --> 17:09.332
- I just swapped crepe recipes

17:09.376 --> 17:11.334
with a French cooking legend.

17:11.378 --> 17:13.336
This is the best party ever.

17:13.380 --> 17:16.426
- Excuse me, since when
do you drink?

17:16.470 --> 17:20.300
- Whoa,
where did I even get that?

17:20.343 --> 17:22.215
- You know what?
You're right.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.347
Something is definitely wrong.

17:26.349 --> 17:27.872
- Move out of the way.

17:30.005 --> 17:32.138
It is time.

17:36.272 --> 17:39.275
- Of course,
the perfect revenge,

17:39.319 --> 17:40.494
a magical guillotine.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.148
- Shh.

17:42.191 --> 17:45.194
- Guys, be careful, I think
Marie's about to make her move.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.157
- Now!

17:52.506 --> 17:54.638
Let them eat cake!

18:00.383 --> 18:03.125
- Cake, cake.
- Need some cake.

18:10.001 --> 18:12.047
- Crazy.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.487
-  Pardon me.
-  Pardon me.

18:17.531 --> 18:19.576
- Pardonne moi.
- Pardonne moi.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.883
- So it's not a guillotine.

18:21.926 --> 18:25.408
- What day is it?

18:25.452 --> 18:28.585
- Uh, how long
have you been here?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.417
- Oh, my God, he's dead.

18:34.461 --> 18:38.378
Ugh, he literally
partied himself to death.

18:38.421 --> 18:39.509
So tacky.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.076
- Look, no, he's not
the only one.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.252
What is happening?

18:43.296 --> 18:45.776
- That's why I don't eat carbs.

18:45.820 --> 18:48.823
This woman is
next-level popular

18:48.866 --> 18:52.218
People would rather die
than leave.

18:52.261 --> 18:53.219
Talk about FOMO.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.611
- My God, that's it.

18:54.655 --> 18:56.483
Marie Antoinette
was beheaded for partying

18:56.526 --> 18:58.267
while France starved,
and now she is literally

18:58.311 --> 19:00.748
killing the Revolution
with a nonstop party.

19:00.791 --> 19:04.839
Legends, we figured it out.
Charm is her superpower.

19:04.882 --> 19:05.927
Hello?

19:05.970 --> 19:07.668
Ray, Nate, Behrad?

19:07.711 --> 19:10.279
It's like she's gotten
to everyone except for us.

19:10.323 --> 19:11.280
So we have to stop this.

19:11.324 --> 19:13.804
- Wait, I'm on the team?

19:13.848 --> 19:15.154
- Sure.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.198
- Okay, what's the plan?

19:16.242 --> 19:18.548
- Uh, we have to find a way

19:18.592 --> 19:21.203
to get Marie Antoinette
out of here without a riot.

19:22.987 --> 19:25.425
The only way to get a celebrity
to leave her own party quietly

19:25.468 --> 19:27.992
is to make her think
there's a cooler party

19:28.036 --> 19:30.386
somewhere else
that she's not at.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.127
- Let's go tell her.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.783
- Uh-uh, girl, you're not gonna
get anywhere in this ensemble.

19:35.826 --> 19:37.437
- What are you doing?
Stop.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.440
- Hey, trust me.

19:42.093 --> 19:43.660
- Ugh.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

19:43.704 --> 19:45.009
Come on.

19:45.053 --> 19:49.231
♪ Don't you walk away

19:49.275 --> 19:51.494
- That's her, Natalie.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.714
- Oh, she's good.

19:53.757 --> 19:54.845
- Yeah.

20:00.024 --> 20:01.243
- You loved her.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.158
- It's quite the track record,
isn't it?

20:03.202 --> 20:06.553
One lover sent to hell,
the other one a ghost.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.426
- Please, John,
it's eating you up.

20:10.470 --> 20:11.993
You have to stop.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.603
- Look, Natalie, you're gonna
have to trust me

20:13.647 --> 20:15.170
on this one, all right?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.780
I've got it under control.

20:16.824 --> 20:20.871
- If Lester hadn't been there,
I would have lost you tonight.

20:20.915 --> 20:23.961
Look, let's just
leave all this behind.

20:24.005 --> 20:27.530
We'll go to New York.
We'll start clean.

20:27.574 --> 20:30.359
You have to choose.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.883
Magic or me.

20:39.499 --> 20:41.544
Screw you, John Constantine.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.198
- All right, that's enough,
all right?

20:43.242 --> 20:45.461
I don't want you in my head
or in my memories!

20:45.505 --> 20:46.984
No more games!

20:47.028 --> 20:49.422
- We're trapped in this house
with a knife-wielding ghost,

20:49.465 --> 20:51.293
and you're still refusing
to own up to your past.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.252
- You are a fine one to talk,
aren't you?

20:53.295 --> 20:56.603
Well, why don't we poke around
in your closet for a while, eh?

20:56.646 --> 20:58.953
- Why did you leave, Charlie?
- Uh, guys?

20:58.996 --> 21:00.433
- I'm no hero.
It was time to go.

21:00.476 --> 21:01.651
- Yeah, what, you
just wandered

21:01.695 --> 21:03.087
into my house
looking for a party?

21:03.131 --> 21:04.567
What are you really
doing here, eh?

21:04.611 --> 21:06.613
- Don't even try
and turn this on me, all right?

21:06.656 --> 21:08.484
It's your lies
that have trapped us here.

21:16.405 --> 21:17.667
She's right, John.

21:17.711 --> 21:21.192
- Natalie, is that really you?

21:31.115 --> 21:33.988
- Every level of the party
has its guardians.

21:34.031 --> 21:35.729
Getting past the bouncer, easy.

21:35.772 --> 21:40.647
Getting past the friends,
you need to know someone.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.257
- But we don't know anybody.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.782
- I know that guy.

21:45.826 --> 21:48.785
- You know Napoleon?
- No, but they don't know that.

21:48.829 --> 21:52.789
Bonjour, Napoleon.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.488
We're with him.

21:58.969 --> 22:00.667
Oh, she separated
from the pack.

22:00.710 --> 22:03.234
Now's the time.
- Oh, good, work your magic.

22:03.278 --> 22:05.498
- Oh, teaching moment.

22:05.541 --> 22:08.327
The big secret to being cool,
confidence.

22:08.370 --> 22:11.504
It makes people think
you have something they don't.

22:11.547 --> 22:15.508
You got this, Captain.
- No, but I don't--ah...

22:15.551 --> 22:18.119
Thank you.

22:24.430 --> 22:27.346
- I do not know you.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.304
What are you doing here?

22:29.348 --> 22:30.392
- Uh...
- Hmm?

22:30.436 --> 22:31.567
- Ah...
- Ah?

22:31.611 --> 22:34.440
- Leaving.
- Ugh, leaving?

22:34.483 --> 22:36.050
Ugh.

22:37.443 --> 22:41.621
- Actually, I am going
to the after-party.

22:41.664 --> 22:44.580
- What is this "aprés-party"?

22:44.624 --> 22:46.800
- Mm, it's a party
after the party.

22:46.843 --> 22:48.584
It's the best place to be.

22:48.628 --> 22:49.716
- Where is it?

22:49.759 --> 22:51.587
- Mm, I can't tell you.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.067
- Ugh.
- But I can take you.

22:53.110 --> 22:56.723
- Oui,take me.
- Mm.

22:59.073 --> 23:02.598
- Oh, oh, this is my bestie,
Zari--she's coming with.

23:02.642 --> 23:04.426
- Yas, queen.
Mm.

23:04.470 --> 23:06.428
- Guys, I have Marie, and we're
taking her to the Waverider.

23:06.472 --> 23:07.734
- That's a good idea.

23:07.777 --> 23:09.605
We can have her
all to ourselves.

23:09.649 --> 23:12.608
- Whoo!
- Marie, come back.

23:15.524 --> 23:17.657
There is an "aprés-party."

23:22.575 --> 23:23.793
- Guys, we have company.

23:23.837 --> 23:26.274
- Oh, the after-party's
right this way.

23:29.712 --> 23:31.540
- Guys, I need backup.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.938
Corsets are so impractical.

23:37.981 --> 23:39.635
- Marie, where's the party?

23:42.072 --> 23:44.553
- I do not think
this is a good idea.

23:44.597 --> 23:47.295
- We're gonna party our faces
off--it's gonna be great.

23:47.338 --> 23:48.949
- Oh!

23:59.438 --> 24:00.613
- Ew.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.049
- Should've seen that coming.

24:02.092 --> 24:04.007
- Return me to my body
this instant,

24:04.051 --> 24:06.488
or I will have
your head for this.

24:06.532 --> 24:09.186
- Get her to the Waverider!
- Oh, this is weird.

24:13.713 --> 24:15.323
- This party stinks!

24:15.366 --> 24:17.891
- Oh, so true, girl.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.849
But not the point.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.721
She's annoying, you can just--

24:21.764 --> 24:22.722
both:
Yeah.

24:22.765 --> 24:24.506
- Ah, get this thing off of me.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.943
- Ugh, I can't believe
I tried the drink.

24:26.987 --> 24:28.684
- Can't believe I ate
all that gluten-filled cake.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.556
- I can't believe how heavy
that head is.

24:30.599 --> 24:31.948
- Yeah, she really had you
under her spell.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.559
If it weren't for
our interim legend here,

24:33.602 --> 24:34.647
you guys would've partied
to death.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.823
- Well, just to play it safe,

24:36.866 --> 24:40.696
I'm gonna take this
into the library.

24:40.740 --> 24:41.958
- Aah! You see?

24:42.002 --> 24:44.134
- Oh, I'll help you.
- Don't get creepy, Ray.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.833
- So, my sister the superhero.
- Hmm.

24:46.876 --> 24:48.704
- Should I get Gideon
to make you a cowl?

24:48.748 --> 24:50.097
- Mm, cowls are
for middle-aged women

24:50.140 --> 24:51.533
who want to hide
their necks.

24:51.577 --> 24:54.710
But I do need a dress
for the party tonight.

24:54.754 --> 24:56.320
- Fabricator's all yours.

24:56.364 --> 24:57.713
- Yay, thank you.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.850
- Is that really you, Nat?

25:03.893 --> 25:06.505
- I need to hear you say it.

25:06.548 --> 25:09.464
Why did you bring me back?

25:09.508 --> 25:11.684
- Because I loved you, Nat.

25:11.727 --> 25:14.382
I never stopped.

25:14.425 --> 25:15.688
- I'm not here

25:15.731 --> 25:18.560
for the John Constantine
broken hero act.

25:23.260 --> 25:25.567
Say it to my face.

25:25.611 --> 25:28.265
I need to hear the truth.

25:29.615 --> 25:32.313
- I brought you back...

25:32.356 --> 25:35.751
to prove to you
that I was right...

25:35.795 --> 25:39.581
to show you that I was right
to choose magic over us.

25:44.630 --> 25:47.633
- Thank you.

25:47.676 --> 25:50.853
I needed you to admit
to yourself what you did...

25:50.897 --> 25:53.073
because if you're going
to save Astra,

25:53.116 --> 25:55.815
you need to do it for her,
not for your ego.

25:55.858 --> 25:58.339
- Oh, I have tried
to save her, Nat,

25:58.382 --> 26:01.777
I have tried,
but I don't know how.

26:01.821 --> 26:04.432
- I think I found a way.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.349
Follow me.

26:10.873 --> 26:13.702
- Uh, yoo-hoo.

26:14.964 --> 26:16.879
Hello?
E-excuse me?

26:16.923 --> 26:20.230
Can you help me?
Where's my body?

26:20.274 --> 26:22.885
- You were throwing a party
intended to kill people,

26:22.929 --> 26:25.540
so, no, not gonna help you.

26:28.064 --> 26:32.895
When I was 14, I was forced
to leave my family.

26:34.201 --> 26:38.640
People saw the dresses,
the parties, the hair,

26:38.684 --> 26:43.689
and they assumed
I was a spoiled brat.

26:43.732 --> 26:49.695
Really, I was just
a lonely Viennese girl

26:49.738 --> 26:52.175
trying to fit into
French society.

26:52.219 --> 26:55.614
- I've been famous
since I was six years old.

26:55.657 --> 26:59.661
I don't know if people love me
or love to hate me.

26:59.705 --> 27:02.055
What they don't understand is
how hard I work

27:02.098 --> 27:03.926
to create a fantasy
for them.

27:03.970 --> 27:09.758
- The secret is to never let
the party stop.

27:09.802 --> 27:11.673
If I had known then
what I know now...

27:13.457 --> 27:17.766
- Gidget, is there anything
I need to worry about?

27:17.810 --> 27:19.855
- Interim Captain Sharpe
instructed you

27:19.899 --> 27:21.770
not to look at your future.

27:22.858 --> 27:24.686
Just a peek,
little lady computer.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.557
- As you wish.

27:26.601 --> 27:28.690
October 7, 2045.

27:28.734 --> 27:31.911
- Zari Tarazi faces major
backlash from her fans,

27:31.954 --> 27:34.914
known as Z Nation,
after the FDA

27:34.957 --> 27:36.437
banned her perfume
Dragonesque

27:36.480 --> 27:38.831
for destroying users'
sense of smell.

27:38.874 --> 27:40.746
Oh, no.

27:40.789 --> 27:42.704
- I trusted her.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.619
I wanted to be her,

27:44.663 --> 27:47.883
but now I'll never smell
another flower because of her.

27:47.927 --> 27:50.146
- From Z-Nation
to Zero-Nation,

27:50.190 --> 27:52.583
Zari Tarazi's
Cat-Chat followers

27:52.627 --> 27:55.848
have plummeted
to almost zero.

27:56.979 --> 27:58.981
- Meow!

27:59.025 --> 28:01.331
- But I didn't know

28:01.375 --> 28:04.421
there was anything wrong
with the perfume.

28:04.465 --> 28:06.641
This is so unfair.

28:07.598 --> 28:10.558
Okay, I have to get out
in front of this.

28:10.601 --> 28:13.648
Maybe Gidget
can make me a new perfume.

28:15.084 --> 28:16.999
Or I can just take yours.

28:17.043 --> 28:19.349
- No, you cannot have it.

28:19.393 --> 28:21.047
- I mean, it's not like
you're using it.

28:21.090 --> 28:22.439
You have half a neck.

28:24.093 --> 28:27.444
- Why do you care so much
about a bottle of perf--

28:30.883 --> 28:34.756
Oh, you're not super charming,

28:34.800 --> 28:38.325
you used
magical popularity perfume.

28:38.368 --> 28:41.937
Honestly, that makes me
feel better about myself.

28:41.981 --> 28:43.199
Hmm.

28:43.243 --> 28:44.766
- Huh, what are you doing?

28:44.810 --> 28:46.855
- Shh.

28:46.899 --> 28:48.639
- Can't have you
ratting me out.

29:20.933 --> 29:22.630
- Oh, there you are.
Thank God, thank God.

29:22.673 --> 29:26.286
I have been so worried,
but, uh, don't worry--

29:26.329 --> 29:28.897
No, I've totally been keeping
up your Catchat account.

29:28.941 --> 29:31.117
Yesterday I posted
a picture of a cat

29:31.160 --> 29:33.510
licking a tube
of Dragonesque lipstick.

29:33.554 --> 29:38.037
- Gross, Les-Lay.
I would never post that.

29:38.080 --> 29:41.257
- I'm so sorry.
I will delete it.

29:41.301 --> 29:44.913
Here is the hero bottle
for the photoshoot.

29:44.957 --> 29:47.829
- Actually, change of plans.

29:47.873 --> 29:50.832
- Oh, so retro.
- Thanks.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.660
Oh, hi.
- Hey, Z.

29:52.703 --> 29:54.401
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
watch the s'more.

29:54.444 --> 29:56.229
What are you doing?
- Sorry, babe.

29:56.272 --> 29:58.579
- So have you decided where you
want to do the proposal yet?

29:58.622 --> 29:59.885
- The what?

29:59.928 --> 30:01.408
- Didn't my agent call you?

30:01.451 --> 30:03.889
- Yeah, um, I haven't had
a chance to tell you yet, Z,

30:03.932 --> 30:07.588
but S'mores' team came up
with the most epic idea.

30:07.631 --> 30:09.198
He should...

30:09.242 --> 30:12.462
propose to you at
next week's MTV Movie Awards

30:12.506 --> 30:16.379
in advance of your DJ and Z
co-branded sunglasses launch.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.381
- Sorry.
We're getting married?

30:18.425 --> 30:19.905
- Yeah, or we can do it
somewhere more chill,

30:19.948 --> 30:21.384
you know, like,
at the DJ S'more Money

30:21.428 --> 30:23.038
spring break
house party live cast.

30:23.082 --> 30:25.040
Something like that?
- How romantic.

30:25.084 --> 30:26.476
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.

30:26.520 --> 30:27.913
Okay, let's do this.
- Ready for this. Let's go.

30:27.956 --> 30:29.305
- Hey, hey!
- So exciting.

30:29.349 --> 30:31.742
- Okay, one spritz
should be safe.

30:31.786 --> 30:34.223
Spray, delay, walk away.

30:34.267 --> 30:36.225
You have to do a 23andMe.

30:36.269 --> 30:38.532
I mean, she must be
related to you.

30:38.575 --> 30:41.274
Here, doesn't she look
exactly like you?

30:41.317 --> 30:44.581
- Ray, I am looking at
a gagged, decapitated woman.

30:44.625 --> 30:46.105
If that's what
you think I look like,

30:46.148 --> 30:47.933
we have a lot
of processing to do.

30:47.976 --> 30:48.977
- Oh, no, look--

30:49.021 --> 30:51.197
Sorry, Miss Antoinette.

30:51.240 --> 30:55.331
Thief!

30:55.375 --> 30:57.856
- Can you taste the cardamom?
- I can't.

30:57.899 --> 31:00.075
I can't taste anything
because your sister's perfume

31:00.119 --> 31:01.816
clogged up my entire
olfactory system.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.165
Everything tastes like--

31:03.209 --> 31:06.212
- Zari, Zari stole
Marie Antoinette's perfume.

31:06.255 --> 31:07.648
- You should see what Mick
stole from Mexico.

31:07.691 --> 31:08.692
It's disgusting.

31:08.736 --> 31:10.346
- Should consider
ourselves lucky.

31:10.390 --> 31:12.044
At least she didn't do
something to screw up history.

31:12.087 --> 31:15.482
- Oh, my God, the perfume.
That's how Marie did it.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.092
Zari and I weren't affected
'cause we couldn't smell

31:17.136 --> 31:18.920
because of the Dragonesque.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.617
Who knows what kind of damage
she could do with that?

31:20.661 --> 31:23.403
- It's all my fault.
I shouldn't have let her stay.

31:23.446 --> 31:25.535
- I knew it was too early
to pat myself on the back.

31:25.579 --> 31:27.929
- Ah, look, it wouldn't be
a true Legends mission

31:27.973 --> 31:29.017
unless something went wrong.

31:33.717 --> 31:35.067
Or several things.

31:40.507 --> 31:44.903
Uh, wasn't there a body
on that stretcher?

31:57.219 --> 32:00.048
- Have I told you how hot
you look in that dress?

32:00.092 --> 32:02.050
- No, but you can tell me now.

32:02.094 --> 32:04.139
- Super hot!

32:04.183 --> 32:07.099
And you smell fantastic.

32:07.142 --> 32:08.970
You know what?
Screw our agents.

32:09.014 --> 32:11.190
I don't want to wait till
the fall launch

32:11.233 --> 32:15.672
of our sunglasses in October
to begin my life with you.

32:15.716 --> 32:16.804
Hey, listen up!

32:16.847 --> 32:18.893
S'more Money has
an announcement to make!

32:18.937 --> 32:22.027
Zari Tarazi,
will you marry me?

32:22.070 --> 32:24.638
- Uh, S'more--Oh!

32:27.467 --> 32:28.947
Ugh.

32:36.215 --> 32:39.261
- I think I just got
a little too popular.

32:40.871 --> 32:42.699
Oh, oh, God.

32:47.661 --> 32:50.838
- Here, body, body, body,
body, body.

32:50.881 --> 32:53.797
Oh.

32:53.841 --> 32:57.236
Okay, body.
No one wants to hurt you.

32:57.279 --> 32:58.324
- Speak for yourself!

32:58.367 --> 33:01.196
- Hey, come on, Mick.
She's harmless.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.633
It's just a headless body.

33:03.677 --> 33:05.548
Oh, whoa.

33:05.592 --> 33:08.334
A little help here.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.252
No, Mick, don't!

33:28.223 --> 33:29.877
- She's mine!

33:32.184 --> 33:33.794
- Okay, we need
to protect ourselves.

33:33.837 --> 33:35.100
Zari's deployed
Marie's perfume.

33:35.143 --> 33:37.232
- Ah!

33:40.148 --> 33:42.890
- Okay, team, A.L.O.H.A. time.

33:45.719 --> 33:47.460
- Run, run!

33:49.114 --> 33:50.941
- Nate, what do you got?

33:50.985 --> 33:53.161
- I'm assessing Zari
used too much of the perfume,

33:53.205 --> 33:55.033
'cause this crowd is bananas.

33:55.076 --> 33:56.425
- Behrad?

33:56.469 --> 33:58.949
- I'm listening, and I hear
another mob coming.

33:58.993 --> 34:00.690
- Okay, I'm observing,
and there are

34:00.734 --> 34:02.344
way too many people
for us to stop.

34:02.388 --> 34:04.216
We need to get that perfume
off of her to stop this.

34:04.259 --> 34:06.174
- How?
- I have an idea.

34:06.218 --> 34:07.219
I need your help.

34:20.971 --> 34:22.321
- Behrad, now!

34:27.239 --> 34:28.675
- You guys came back for me.

34:28.718 --> 34:31.286
- A Legend never gets left
behind, even an interim one.

34:31.330 --> 34:32.809
Follow me.

34:32.853 --> 34:35.160
- What are you doing?
- Trust me.

34:35.203 --> 34:37.336
- There's too many of them.
I can't stop them all.

34:38.685 --> 34:41.122
- Come on!
- Okay.

34:43.646 --> 34:45.779
- Well, we've tried
the A.L.O.H.A. method.

34:45.822 --> 34:47.694
The A.L.O.
haven't gotten us anywhere.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.261
- What does the H stand for?

34:49.304 --> 34:50.349
- Hydrate!

35:00.533 --> 35:01.838
- S'mores.
- Yeah.

35:01.882 --> 35:03.144
- Zari's boyfriend?
- That's me.

35:03.188 --> 35:04.493
- Ha.

35:05.581 --> 35:07.148
Okay, guys.
- Oh, God.

35:07.192 --> 35:08.541
- Party's over.

35:09.890 --> 35:12.327
- Did Zari just jump
into the fountain?

35:12.371 --> 35:14.503
Whoa, talk about
desperate stunts.

35:14.547 --> 35:17.767
- I'm calling my agent
to schedule a divorce!

35:18.768 --> 35:20.683
- Wait, what does
that last A stand for?

35:20.727 --> 35:21.815
- Attack!

35:26.602 --> 35:27.560
- Hey.

35:38.484 --> 35:40.268
- Look at us.

35:40.312 --> 35:43.445
- We thought we could change
the world with our little loom.

35:43.489 --> 35:46.144
- This one's
to bring me mum back.

35:47.971 --> 35:51.410
- The Loom of Fate--it's not
just a story, it's real.

35:51.453 --> 35:54.543
- Three old Greek birds
cutting threads,

35:54.587 --> 35:57.416
hunkering down over a loom
to weave together

35:57.459 --> 35:59.374
the fate of humankind.

36:00.723 --> 36:03.335
If it's real, how come
I haven't heard of it, eh?

36:03.378 --> 36:06.425
- You're asking
the wrong person.

36:06.468 --> 36:09.210
Why do you think
I brought her here?

36:12.257 --> 36:13.606
What the bloody hell was that?

36:13.649 --> 36:15.477
- What do you know
about the Loom of Fate?

36:15.521 --> 36:16.783
- I know bugger all.

36:16.826 --> 36:18.437
- How did you find
this place, Charlie?

36:18.480 --> 36:19.699
- You told me about it.

36:19.742 --> 36:21.179
Oh, bollocks, I've never told
anyone about it.

36:21.222 --> 36:23.398
Natalie brought you here to
help me save Astra

36:23.442 --> 36:24.791
and stop those encores,
so tell me,

36:24.834 --> 36:26.271
what do you know
about the Loom of Date?

36:26.314 --> 36:27.489
- Fate's a load of crap.

36:27.533 --> 36:29.056
- You haven't answered
my question, Charlie.

36:29.099 --> 36:30.362
- Look, you want to know
what I'm hiding from?

36:30.405 --> 36:32.233
- Yes, I do!
- It's that bloody loom!

36:35.628 --> 36:38.544
- So it is real?
- It was...

36:39.458 --> 36:41.242
Until I destroyed it.

36:45.551 --> 36:48.771
- "Lady in cheap pantsuit
ruins party."

36:48.815 --> 36:51.296
Ava was right
about no phones on the ship.

36:51.339 --> 36:53.472
- Had Gideon
whip you up some new clothes.

36:53.515 --> 36:55.735
Hope you like flannel.
- I do not.

36:55.778 --> 36:57.040
Ew.

36:57.084 --> 36:59.042
Listen, I know,
you're gonna tell me

36:59.086 --> 37:01.567
how selfish I was
for stealing the perfume

37:01.610 --> 37:03.264
and burning the team.

37:03.308 --> 37:05.484
You guys toil away in obscurity
to save humanity

37:05.527 --> 37:07.660
from unknown baddies,
and I just go and spray

37:07.703 --> 37:09.401
evil perfume all over
New York City

37:09.444 --> 37:11.316
without a second thought.

37:11.359 --> 37:13.056
I'm jerk.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.362
I'm sorry.

37:14.406 --> 37:17.539
- I was just gonna ask
if you wanted a doughnut.

37:17.583 --> 37:22.762
- I haven't had a doughnut
in 1,743 days.

37:25.460 --> 37:27.593
- Hey, what is this,
eh, doughnut?

37:27.636 --> 37:29.159
both:
Shut up, Marie.

37:29.203 --> 37:30.335
- Ah, phoo!

37:31.771 --> 37:33.686
- Hey.

37:33.729 --> 37:34.904
Wow.

37:34.948 --> 37:36.166
Nice shirt.

37:36.210 --> 37:39.213
- Hmm, you would be
into lumberjack chic.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.520
- There's an incoming hologram
from Captain Lance.

37:41.563 --> 37:43.435
- Captain.

37:43.478 --> 37:44.479
How'd the mission go?

37:44.523 --> 37:47.265
- Oh, um...

37:47.308 --> 37:50.355
Well, I...
- Killed it.

37:50.398 --> 37:52.748
- She was a foxy hedgehog
out there.

37:53.923 --> 37:54.794
- Okay.

37:54.837 --> 37:56.317
- We got our encore, Captain.

37:56.361 --> 37:58.232
- Oh, good.
I'm glad to hear it.

37:58.276 --> 38:01.322
Ava, call me later
so I can thank you properly.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.979
- Oh, Captain, my captain.

38:06.022 --> 38:07.981
- "Call me later so I can
properly congratulate you."

38:08.024 --> 38:10.418
- Guys, come on.
- She doesn't sound like that.

38:29.611 --> 38:31.526
- Zari!

38:31.570 --> 38:33.354
Hey, are you okay?

38:33.398 --> 38:34.703
- Yeah, I was--

38:34.747 --> 38:38.490
I was just, uh,
enjoying this doughnut

38:38.533 --> 38:40.579
and thinking--

38:41.928 --> 38:46.454
You locked Marie Antoinette up,
but you let me off the hook.

38:46.498 --> 38:50.110
- I mean,
she killed people, Zari.

38:50.153 --> 38:52.504
You screwed up.
You know, everybody screws up.

38:52.547 --> 38:54.462
- Not you.
- Me?

38:54.506 --> 38:56.899
I feel like
I'm screwing up all the time.

38:56.943 --> 38:58.901
- You were so on mission.

38:58.945 --> 39:01.556
You crashed an A-list party
in a pantsuit

39:01.600 --> 39:03.558
and threw yourself
into a fountain.

39:03.602 --> 39:06.518
- Ugh, see,
it's a perfect example.

39:06.561 --> 39:07.606
- No, it was amazing.

39:07.649 --> 39:09.608
You didn't care
what anyone thought.

39:09.651 --> 39:12.088
You were just being you.

39:13.568 --> 39:15.744
I've been trying
to get people to like me

39:15.788 --> 39:17.703
for so long that...

39:20.575 --> 39:23.143
I've forgotten who I really am.

39:23.186 --> 39:27.582
I have millions
of followers but...

39:27.626 --> 39:29.367
zero friends.

39:31.978 --> 39:33.501
- You got one.

39:35.677 --> 39:36.591
- Really?

39:42.205 --> 39:45.295
- Come on.

39:45.339 --> 39:49.474
- Hmm. Well, as your friend,
I have to tell you...

39:49.517 --> 39:51.040
no more pantsuits.
- Mm.

39:51.084 --> 39:52.564
- You're better than that.

39:52.607 --> 39:53.652
- Deal.

39:55.697 --> 39:57.569
- He still has ten years

39:57.612 --> 39:59.614
before the lung cancer
catches up to him.

39:59.658 --> 40:01.486
- Can you make it zero?

40:01.529 --> 40:05.664
- It's a nasty way to go,
especially all at once.

40:05.707 --> 40:07.448
You sure
that's who you want to be?

40:07.492 --> 40:10.799
- Why is it so hard for people
to let little girls grow up.

40:12.018 --> 40:14.716
- John may be the villain
in your story,

40:14.760 --> 40:18.938
but in mine, he's just
cocktail party conversation.

40:18.981 --> 40:22.376
I have a few enemies of my own.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.597
One day, I'm going to call you,

40:25.640 --> 40:29.035
and you are going
to do me a favor.

40:29.078 --> 40:31.516
- You make favor
sound like sin.

40:33.213 --> 40:35.520
This is hell, sweetie.

40:37.478 --> 40:38.653
- Do it.

40:46.356 --> 40:50.230
- You broke the Loom of Fate?
How old are you?

40:50.273 --> 40:51.579
- Old.

40:51.623 --> 40:53.886
- Well, if you broke it,
why are you still running?

40:56.932 --> 41:00.719
- I scattered those damn pieces
all across the multiverse.

41:00.762 --> 41:03.069
Just put an end to it all.

41:04.244 --> 41:06.159
Recently...

41:06.202 --> 41:09.379
I sensed
that something had changed.

41:09.423 --> 41:12.557
It's like my past
was catching up with me, so...

41:15.560 --> 41:16.604
- John, are you okay?

41:16.648 --> 41:18.911
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I just got a--

41:25.787 --> 41:27.746
- Bye-bye, Johnny.

42:16.577 --> 42:17.883
- Greg, move your head.
