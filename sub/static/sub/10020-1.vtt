WEBVTT

00:04.086 --> 00:06.795
ER

00:06.962 --> 00:08.645
Previously on ER...

00:08.762 --> 00:10.493
Son of a bitch!

00:10.494 --> 00:12.596
I can be a competent surgeon.

00:12.892 --> 00:15.457
I can learn the techniques,
the mechanics.

00:17.531 --> 00:18.851
But I'll never be a great surgeon.

00:18.852 --> 00:22.884
I'm not writing you that prescription
for the Percodan. You need help.

00:23.085 --> 00:24.205
I'm fine.

00:24.206 --> 00:26.604
Your baby was deprived of oxygen
in the womb.

00:26.605 --> 00:29.522
So there's always the possibility
that there could be brain damage.

00:33.087 --> 00:35.344
¡Back off! ¡Shut up!

00:35.345 --> 00:37.602
¡Shut up! ¡Shut up!

00:37.945 --> 00:39.738
"Ambush"

00:39.773 --> 00:41.663
- Can we get this in one night?
- We have to.

00:41.867 --> 00:45.258
- Change batteries in the Lavaliers.
- He's getting more nine-volts.

00:45.468 --> 00:48.141
- It's got that smell.
- Rob, white balance that.

00:48.348 --> 00:51.146
Tony did it. And he laid down
bars and tones.

00:51.349 --> 00:53.624
Why do all hospitals have this smell?

00:53.829 --> 00:56.707
- Pork buns? Who went for food?
- I brought it.

00:56.909 --> 01:00.061
- Thanks a lot.
- Camera mount in Trauma is keystoning.

01:00.270 --> 01:01.669
Hasn't been leveled yet.

01:01.870 --> 01:05.226
Let's get ready to shoot.
Everybody on the same page?

01:05.430 --> 01:06.705
Worried about that iris?

01:06.911 --> 01:08.663
- It's fine.
- The tapes are numbered.

01:08.831 --> 01:13.461
Stuart and I will stick to the doctor.
Luis and Rob, follow our lead. Okay?

01:13.671 --> 01:15.503
This is still breaking up.

01:15.712 --> 01:17.703
We don't get a second chance here.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.982
- I hate hospitals.
- Is Dr. Greene here?

01:20.192 --> 01:21.545
I haven't seen him.

01:21.752 --> 01:24.313
- Are you set in the lounge?
- Just need tapes.

01:24.513 --> 01:27.232
- Where's the battery charger?
- It's in the X-ray room.

01:27.433 --> 01:29.788
Trim RF six. It's too hot.

01:36.714 --> 01:37.704
What is that?

01:37.915 --> 01:41.749
Oh, you know. It's backup footage.
Workplace stuff.

01:42.515 --> 01:43.743
Cubbies still losing?

01:43.955 --> 01:45.389
I haven't been watching.

01:45.596 --> 01:48.110
We put up other stationary cameras
at the desk...

01:48.316 --> 01:50.307
- ... and in that yellow room.
- Trauma 1?

01:50.516 --> 01:55.068
High-traffic areas. Get some wide
angles to cut with for pace, variety.

01:55.277 --> 01:56.392
Right.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.914
We just leave them running.
Get what we get.

02:00.717 --> 02:01.707
It's on?

02:01.918 --> 02:04.307
By the end of the day,
you'll forget we're here.

02:04.998 --> 02:06.556
See you.

02:06.758 --> 02:07.873
Excuse me.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:35.122 --> 02:36.953
We'll start with him coming on.

02:37.162 --> 02:39.996
Too late. He's already in Trauma.
Careful.

02:41.243 --> 02:43.711
- He's the one with the glasses.
- I remember.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.160
Gave him 400 mgs
of morphine in the field.

02:47.364 --> 02:49.958
- How bad does the goal post look?
- I scored.

02:50.164 --> 02:54.362
Let's order pre-op labs. CBC, type
and screen, left lower extremity film.

02:54.564 --> 02:56.920
- Ancef?
- One gram IV piggyback...

02:57.125 --> 02:58.319
...and 100 of gentamicin.

02:58.525 --> 03:01.198
- I really broke it, huh?
- No varsity this fall.

03:01.405 --> 03:03.874
- Varsity? I'm 24 years old.
- You're 24?

03:04.086 --> 03:08.125
- Guess I don't need a pediatrician.
- You'll be carded till you're 40.

03:08.406 --> 03:09.885
- You mind staying?
- You need me?

03:10.086 --> 03:13.124
I just wanna get Dr. Greene
discussing the orders.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.636
- You need the back of my head.
- Yeah.

03:16.127 --> 03:17.526
Dr. Greene, how's that pulse?

03:17.727 --> 03:20.959
Distal pulses are two plus and equal.
No arterial injury.

03:21.168 --> 03:22.362
Good evening.

03:22.568 --> 03:24.081
Dr. Carter, you're early.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.927
Open fracture?

03:27.489 --> 03:29.002
- You need me?
- Yes, actually.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.598
I'm sick of assisting Dr. Welby here.

03:31.809 --> 03:33.367
Why don't you finish the history?

03:33.570 --> 03:35.800
You have pain anywhere
besides your leg?

03:36.010 --> 03:37.921
I kind of jammed my stomach.

03:38.130 --> 03:39.324
Got any allergies?

03:39.530 --> 03:40.963
Just hay fever.

03:41.170 --> 03:43.321
Anything for me?
Oh, this is today?

03:43.531 --> 03:45.123
- Don't look in the lens.
- Right.

03:45.331 --> 03:47.401
- Possible surgical belly.
- You're still here?

03:47.611 --> 03:50.206
Thirty-six hours.
We're short a surgeon.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.450
Belly's benign. Call Ortho.

03:53.652 --> 03:54.971
How's it going?

03:56.292 --> 03:57.567
Pissed off about losing you?

03:57.773 --> 04:00.048
We haven't talked.
When was your last meal?

04:00.253 --> 04:02.289
I ate lunch around 1.

04:02.493 --> 04:04.928
- Cimetidine, 300 mgs IV.
- You got it.

04:05.134 --> 04:07.250
That'll cut the acidity
in your stomach.

04:07.454 --> 04:12.370
If you vomit in the O.R., you'd aspirate
your stomach contents into your lungs.

04:12.575 --> 04:15.009
That's more than he needed to hear.

04:15.215 --> 04:16.567
Whoa! We got a problem.

04:16.774 --> 04:18.128
- What?
- Sorry to interrupt.

04:18.295 --> 04:20.411
A doc says she wasn't
informed about our shoot.

04:20.616 --> 04:22.766
I'll be right there.
Stuart, are you okay?

04:23.256 --> 04:26.134
Dr. Carter, our mike will pick you up
at normal volume.

04:26.336 --> 04:28.328
You can relax and speak naturally.

04:28.537 --> 04:31.097
Carter wasn't acting.
He's really like that.

04:31.297 --> 04:35.006
They're focusing on Dr. Greene.
But their goal is to get a sense-

04:35.217 --> 04:36.970
Kerry, nice do.

04:37.178 --> 04:38.930
and portray it in a positive light.

04:39.098 --> 04:41.009
It says nothing about "positive light. "

04:41.178 --> 04:44.057
It only talks about their rights
to use my name and image.

04:44.259 --> 04:46.056
Why not take this in the lounge?

04:46.219 --> 04:49.495
Anspaugh and Morgenstern think this
will increase public awareness...

04:49.699 --> 04:52.612
- ... of the health care issues we face-
- I understand.

04:52.820 --> 04:54.538
- Sorry, what's your name?
- Luis.

04:54.740 --> 04:58.335
Luis. I'm not saying you're here
to ambush us or do an exposé...

04:58.541 --> 05:00.372
...but there's nothing to stop them.

05:00.581 --> 05:03.971
- If I don't sign, you're wasting film.
- It's tape. It's cheap.

05:04.181 --> 05:06.616
Hi. My husband and I
are the directors.

05:06.822 --> 05:08.892
- Anna Del Amico.
- Do you have questions?

05:09.102 --> 05:12.651
If we could just speak in the lounge,
we'd get this straightened out.

05:12.862 --> 05:14.535
Dr. Del Amico is new here.

05:14.743 --> 05:16.938
If she doesn't sign,
we can shoot around her.

05:17.143 --> 05:19.611
If you're finished, Stuart needs you.

05:19.823 --> 05:21.654
Miss, is this gonna be on TV?

05:21.864 --> 05:22.899
Pre-sold to PBS.

05:23.104 --> 05:25.413
- PBS? Not network?
- No.

05:25.624 --> 05:26.773
Luis.

05:29.384 --> 05:31.103
It's something that Mark agreed to.

05:31.305 --> 05:33.182
- He's excited.
- Think he's up to it?

05:33.385 --> 05:35.341
Yeah, sure. Why not?

05:35.545 --> 05:37.582
Cameras all over, it makes me uptight.

05:37.786 --> 05:39.902
I know.
We'll all be hiding out here.

05:40.106 --> 05:42.700
Mark seems a little shaky right now.

05:42.906 --> 05:44.703
Oh, he's gonna be fine.

05:44.907 --> 05:47.216
I'd be shaky if I had the crap
beaten out of me.

05:47.427 --> 05:51.386
He wanted to do this. That's a good
sign. Maybe he's back on his game.

05:51.587 --> 05:53.977
- Maybe.
- They're here. They're shooting.

05:54.188 --> 05:57.419
There's nothing we can do
except stick up for Mark.

05:57.628 --> 05:58.902
Standing by him.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.588
You look like a star out there.

06:00.789 --> 06:02.666
I'm enjoying all the attention.

06:02.869 --> 06:04.985
Don't get used to everybody
taking orders.

06:05.189 --> 06:06.702
I was hoping for a sequel.

06:06.909 --> 06:09.378
Some of us are working stiffs.
Measles in 4.

06:09.590 --> 06:10.739
Later.

06:24.592 --> 06:27.186
Mr. Schoenberger's in sinus rhythm.

06:27.392 --> 06:31.830
BP's 110/70, pulse is 72, reps are-

06:32.033 --> 06:33.386
Resps- Sorry.

06:33.593 --> 06:35.390
- Should I start over?
- Sure.

06:35.593 --> 06:37.584
Next time you can just keep going.

06:37.793 --> 06:39.750
Well, his cardiogram is normal.

06:39.954 --> 06:42.707
His shortness of breath
was resolved with oxygen.

06:42.914 --> 06:44.711
He may have had indigestion.

06:44.914 --> 06:48.146
Today was all-you-can-eat at
my favorite Mexican place.

06:48.355 --> 06:50.186
Do you have history of heart disease?

06:50.355 --> 06:53.028
No. My relatives generally
prefer cancer.

06:53.235 --> 06:54.828
- Do you smoke?
- Not cigarettes.

06:55.036 --> 06:56.913
He recently took up cigars.

06:57.116 --> 06:58.185
I don't inhale.

06:58.396 --> 07:03.152
I started a cardiac work-up, ordered
a CBC, Chem-7, cardiac enzymes-

07:03.357 --> 07:06.269
That's a little gung-ho for a guy
who ate too many burritos.

07:06.477 --> 07:08.354
He was concerned enough to come in.

07:08.557 --> 07:10.674
That's no reason to order
a million tests.

07:10.878 --> 07:12.311
You can lie back now.

07:12.678 --> 07:15.238
You know where I can get ahold
of any Havanas?

07:15.438 --> 07:18.431
My taste is a little more pedestrian.

07:18.919 --> 07:20.432
I'm happy with one of these.

07:20.639 --> 07:22.197
No wonder you're short of breath.

07:22.399 --> 07:24.515
Seriously? You think it's the cigars?

07:24.719 --> 07:26.597
Those aren't fit to be called cigars.

07:26.800 --> 07:30.475
Lay off the cheapos for a few days
and I think you're gonna feel fine.

07:30.680 --> 07:34.276
- Give up the stogies?
- At least get something decent.

07:35.881 --> 07:38.190
You think this'll be in the movie?

07:42.082 --> 07:45.711
I just dropped by to thank you again
and see how things are going.

07:48.002 --> 07:50.198
You don't have to film this.

07:51.203 --> 07:54.081
- Everything under control?
- Yeah. Yeah, it is.

07:54.283 --> 07:56.080
It seems like a busy night.

07:56.284 --> 07:59.401
Oh, not too busy for a weeknight.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.993
Right. Pretty slow for a weeknight.

08:02.204 --> 08:06.118
- I'm sure it'll pick up later.
- Yeah, later. It should pick up.

08:06.325 --> 08:07.758
You'll get good stuff.

08:07.965 --> 08:12.005
Just making sure things are copacetic,
and thanks again for taking this on.

08:12.206 --> 08:13.275
Sure.

08:15.886 --> 08:19.641
- Stuart, come grab this.
- Excuse me. Who do I give this to?

08:19.847 --> 08:22.998
- You decided to sign?
- Just keep my face off Hard Copy.

08:23.207 --> 08:25.004
The nurses are cooking.

08:25.367 --> 08:27.120
Turn mike to channel three.

08:27.888 --> 08:30.607
The best one was the guy
with the transistor radio.

08:30.808 --> 08:33.845
He said he slipped in the shower
and he sat down.

08:34.048 --> 08:35.880
- Ouch!
- While it was still playing?

08:36.089 --> 08:37.807
"Oops! There it is! "

08:38.409 --> 08:42.038
I asked Mark- Dr. Greene, if he was
going to extract the foreign body.

08:42.249 --> 08:45.083
He said, "No. But I think I'll
tune it to the ball game. "

08:45.290 --> 08:48.168
I got a head lac for Carter.
Has anybody seen him?

08:48.370 --> 08:51.090
Seems like there's a camaraderie
between doctors and nurses.

08:51.291 --> 08:52.963
- What about dating?
- Who, Mark?

08:53.171 --> 08:54.240
You tell me.

08:57.051 --> 08:59.247
- Oh, I'm sorry. I-
- I'll get that.

08:59.452 --> 09:02.410
Actually, we do socialize,
but more as a group.

09:02.612 --> 09:05.080
Dr. Greene comes-
Well, he used to come-

09:05.292 --> 09:06.772
He's been taking it slow.

09:06.973 --> 09:08.292
Since he got beat down.

09:08.493 --> 09:11.053
I mean, beat up.
You know about that, right?

09:13.413 --> 09:16.611
It's a myth about doctors
and nurses dating so much.

09:16.814 --> 09:21.730
More nurses date cops, firemen,
paramedics. Now, that cliché is true.

09:21.935 --> 09:25.484
- Especially cops.
- Especially young cops.

09:28.815 --> 09:30.215
Getting back to Dr. Greene-

09:30.416 --> 09:32.088
I need a nurse in 3.

09:32.296 --> 09:34.935
Okay. Everybody, that was great.

09:35.096 --> 09:36.894
"Lucy, you got some 'splaining to do. "

09:37.057 --> 09:38.172
What?

09:38.377 --> 09:40.333
What about cops and firemen?

09:40.497 --> 09:42.488
- Stay with them. They're miked.
- Jealous?

09:42.657 --> 09:47.288
I just wanna know what you're doing
for them that you're not doing for me.

09:47.498 --> 09:49.489
I'll tell you later
if you bring the cuffs.

09:49.698 --> 09:52.372
- I was gonna get some sleep tonight.
- Don't count on that.

09:52.539 --> 09:55.690
Look at him. I bet he wishes
he could read lips.

09:55.899 --> 09:57.537
Hi there, dumb-ass!

09:58.739 --> 10:00.378
Doug, he's waving.

10:02.020 --> 10:03.214
You got a mike on?

10:03.420 --> 10:04.978
Do you think he could hear me?

10:05.180 --> 10:06.329
Turn it off.

10:07.220 --> 10:11.578
But that's the thing about the ER.
You got to stay on your toes.

10:11.781 --> 10:13.453
- Lily's looking for you.
- On my way.

10:13.661 --> 10:16.460
You're also more on your own.
When I was up in Surgery...

10:16.662 --> 10:20.496
...there was someone looking over
my shoulder, critiquing every move.

10:20.702 --> 10:24.662
- Here the residents are responsible-
- Carter, help me!

10:24.863 --> 10:26.535
I can't get him rolled.

10:26.743 --> 10:30.099
- I think I'm gonna puke again!
- I know. I know.

10:40.185 --> 10:42.096
- I feel much better.
- Good, good.

10:42.305 --> 10:44.773
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm gonna change.

10:44.985 --> 10:48.945
Compazine for our friend, please.
Twenty-five milligrams, PR.

10:49.426 --> 10:51.781
- Excuse me.
- What does that mean? "PR"?

10:51.986 --> 10:53.385
Per rectum.

10:53.746 --> 10:55.226
Do you have to clean this up?

10:55.427 --> 10:56.746
Oh, no.

10:58.267 --> 11:00.019
Housekeeping to Suture Room.

11:00.827 --> 11:04.457
- I don't know what you're looking for.
- Just keep it conversational.

11:04.668 --> 11:07.740
Come and go normally.
Don't be afraid to interrupt.

11:07.948 --> 11:10.543
Talk right to me. I'll be right
next to the camera.

11:11.389 --> 11:14.904
First, explain how long you've been
here, what an Attending does.

11:15.109 --> 11:17.943
My name is Mark Greene
and I've been working here...

11:18.150 --> 11:19.788
...since I finished med school.

11:20.670 --> 11:23.138
I've got the Gl bleeding
in Curtain 2 admitted.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.339
Thanks, Kerry.

11:24.550 --> 11:27.019
Describe how an emergency room
serves the public.

11:27.231 --> 11:29.062
For a lot of people, we're-

11:29.271 --> 11:32.149
The paramedics have a 37-year-old
in respiratory distress.

11:32.351 --> 11:33.944
The neighbor says he has cancer.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.302
Prep Trauma 1 and find Carter.

11:36.512 --> 11:39.310
The labs are back on Schoenberger.
Take a look.

11:39.552 --> 11:41.225
- The smoker?
- The CK-MB's are high.

11:41.433 --> 11:44.072
- Did he go home?
- He's getting ready to go.

11:44.753 --> 11:47.506
We have a respiratory distress
pulling up.

11:47.713 --> 11:48.829
I'm on it.

11:49.314 --> 11:51.464
Mr. Schoenberger,
we got your tests back...

11:51.674 --> 11:55.269
...with a result we didn't expect,
indicating a possible problem.

11:55.474 --> 11:58.308
- What do you mean?
- Stick around for one more test.

11:58.515 --> 12:01.154
Troponin T. It's just for clarification.

12:01.355 --> 12:03.232
We can do it on the blood
we've drawn.

12:03.395 --> 12:05.864
- Better safe than sorry.
- While you're waiting...

12:06.036 --> 12:08.311
...we're gonna stick you
back on a monitor.

12:12.317 --> 12:15.912
An elevated CK-MB indicates
heart muscle damage.

12:16.117 --> 12:17.709
- A heart attack?
- Right.

12:17.917 --> 12:19.397
I'll get another EKG.

12:19.598 --> 12:20.872
Can it mean something else?

12:21.038 --> 12:23.313
It's probably an Ml.
The other tests will confirm.

12:23.478 --> 12:24.513
And then what?

12:24.758 --> 12:27.353
Well, regardless
of the other results...

12:27.519 --> 12:30.431
...an elevated CK-MB
means he's had an Ml.

12:30.639 --> 12:34.997
I'm just giving him a little time
to adjust to that possibility.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.794
And, of course, since I missed it...

12:38.000 --> 12:40.753
...I'm buying some time
to cover my ass.

12:43.121 --> 12:45.077
A 37-year-old man
in respiratory distress!

12:45.281 --> 12:48.432
He was diagnosed with esophageal
cancer six months ago.

12:48.641 --> 12:50.519
I watched him while Krista
was at the store.

12:50.682 --> 12:53.640
- He hasn't been breathing that good-
- Out of the way!

12:53.842 --> 12:56.675
He's tachy at 120.
Pressure's 130/100.

12:56.882 --> 12:59.238
Resps increased.
He's got a lot of secretions!

12:59.443 --> 13:02.515
Let's get him on high-flow O-2.
Prep an intubation tray.

13:02.723 --> 13:05.157
On my count. One, two, three.

13:05.364 --> 13:06.843
Help him. He can't breathe.

13:07.044 --> 13:08.443
Stand back, sir, please!

13:08.644 --> 13:12.398
Suction these secretions.
Hang two liters of saline.

13:12.604 --> 13:14.561
- Pulse ox is 89.
- Should I intubate?

13:14.765 --> 13:17.074
With this mass,
we'd have to crike him.

13:17.285 --> 13:20.163
I don't want to use extraordinary
measures if he has a DNR.

13:20.365 --> 13:22.561
Do you know anything about his wishes?

13:22.766 --> 13:24.722
He's the best bass player ever.

13:24.926 --> 13:26.279
You can't light that in here.

13:26.486 --> 13:28.044
Chuny, keep suctioning.

13:28.246 --> 13:29.362
- Grab blood gas.
- Got it.

13:29.567 --> 13:31.239
Pulse ox down to 87.

13:31.447 --> 13:35.042
Prep a crike tray. Let's give him 600
of clindamycin, IV.

13:35.247 --> 13:36.363
Get the slate.

13:36.528 --> 13:37.756
- Excuse me.
- What's his name?

13:37.968 --> 13:40.562
- Boz.
- Boz, can you hear me?

13:40.768 --> 13:43.760
You're having trouble breathing.
Do you want help?

13:43.969 --> 13:46.119
- Antibiotics are up.
- I gotta get in here.

13:46.329 --> 13:49.446
I'm gonna hold up the slate,
and you write on it.

13:49.649 --> 13:52.801
Boz, do you want
a cricothyroidectomy?

13:53.010 --> 13:57.208
I can cut a hole in your neck to help
you breathe. Do you want that?

13:57.610 --> 14:00.171
If you can't write your answer,
I have to put the tube in.

14:00.371 --> 14:02.521
Do you want to be criked?

14:02.731 --> 14:04.642
Don't let him die!
Give him the crike!

14:04.851 --> 14:06.409
I can't get this!

14:08.092 --> 14:09.081
Okay. Crike tray!

14:09.292 --> 14:10.850
Do it! Do it!

14:14.812 --> 14:18.362
No, no. You do not want to know.

14:18.573 --> 14:20.052
I wouldn't ask if I didn't.

14:20.253 --> 14:22.722
I have done this too long
not to know.

14:22.934 --> 14:25.448
This job, people don't
wanna hear about.

14:25.654 --> 14:28.168
Why? Because of what you clean up?

14:28.374 --> 14:29.568
This is nothing.

14:29.734 --> 14:33.648
Believe me, this here
is just a little picnic.

14:33.855 --> 14:36.164
You ought to see
what some of them do.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.526
A body is only so big.

14:39.696 --> 14:43.735
You couldn't hardly believe
all that comes out if it.

14:43.936 --> 14:45.574
You get used to it, though.

14:45.737 --> 14:48.297
Like every mama and daddy
gets used to...

14:48.497 --> 14:50.692
...changing a baby's diaper.

14:50.897 --> 14:54.015
But the blood and the gore...

14:54.778 --> 14:56.769
You know what the gore is, right?

14:57.738 --> 15:00.696
That's the part
you don't talk about...

15:01.379 --> 15:04.655
...when you go home
and they ask you how your day was.

15:05.419 --> 15:06.818
No, no.

15:07.859 --> 15:09.816
It doesn't bother me.

15:10.020 --> 15:13.296
You see, I'm a religious person.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.934
And I believe human beings...

15:16.140 --> 15:19.338
...were created in God's image.

15:20.381 --> 15:24.135
So whatever I'm cleaning up
must be just fine.

15:26.622 --> 15:28.021
You believe?

15:28.222 --> 15:30.531
I don't know.
You mean, believe in God?

15:32.022 --> 15:34.218
You couldn't do my job
if you didn't.

15:34.423 --> 15:39.178
You could maybe be a doctor
or a nurse or make a movie.

15:39.984 --> 15:41.576
Not my job.

15:42.584 --> 15:44.302
I'll tell you something else-

15:44.504 --> 15:46.893
We need you.
This guy stopped breathing.

15:47.104 --> 15:48.584
I'm on my way.

15:50.505 --> 15:52.143
I'll catch you later.

15:52.585 --> 15:53.938
Sure you will.

16:02.186 --> 16:04.747
The ones I can remember
are from my first year.

16:04.987 --> 16:08.741
After a while you get protective.
You don't let them get to you.

16:08.987 --> 16:12.185
What does it take these days
to break through your armor?

16:12.388 --> 16:16.176
Doesn't happen. But there was
this one girl my first year.

16:16.388 --> 16:18.379
I got used to this
as a county facility.

16:18.589 --> 16:21.899
I treated a lot of homeless people,
people from the projects.

16:22.109 --> 16:24.987
One day this girl came in,
traffic accident...

16:25.189 --> 16:28.660
...in a coma, brain dead.
And I realized I knew her.

16:28.870 --> 16:31.987
She was the sister of a guy
I had gone to med school with.

16:32.190 --> 16:36.867
One night, she tried to show me how
to slam dance, just fooling around.

16:37.871 --> 16:41.785
I realized that trauma isn't something
that happens to other people.

16:41.992 --> 16:43.266
It could happen to you.

16:43.472 --> 16:44.621
That's right.

16:44.912 --> 16:48.063
- Does it change things when it is you?
- What do you mean?

16:48.272 --> 16:51.868
When you yourself are traumatized
as a doctor...

16:52.273 --> 16:54.070
You have a splint on your wrist.

16:54.273 --> 16:56.833
I heard that you had
an incident recently-

16:56.993 --> 16:58.393
Is that what you' re doing here?

16:58.594 --> 17:00.027
- I'm sorry.
- I didn't agree-

17:00.234 --> 17:01.826
Everybody worries about safety.

17:02.034 --> 17:03.831
Is that why you picked me?

17:04.034 --> 17:07.345
- We don't want you uncomfortable.
- You don't have to talk about it.

17:07.555 --> 17:09.465
- Good.
- But we are here.

17:09.675 --> 17:11.188
We're committed to making this.

17:11.395 --> 17:13.785
We want you to say
what's on your mind.

17:13.996 --> 17:17.625
I have nothing to say. I agreed
to let you follow me around.

17:17.836 --> 17:19.428
No more comments or interviews.

17:19.636 --> 17:22.231
We are professionals.
We're not here to attack you.

17:22.436 --> 17:23.665
Agi.

17:23.957 --> 17:25.185
Damn!

17:27.317 --> 17:30.196
- That's his daughter?
- No, it's his wife.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.636
Esophageal cancer.
It's a horrible death.

17:33.838 --> 17:37.468
Dr. Greene criked him.
He's running out of surgical options.

17:37.679 --> 17:40.591
Are you sure you wanna speak
to the wife? She's young.

17:40.799 --> 17:43.951
It may be difficult to get her
to understand the situation.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.639
No, I'd like to try.

17:46.440 --> 17:50.752
Normally, we wouldn't have an intern
take this on. But Carter's been around.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.873
Technically, I'm not an intern.
I'm second-year.

17:54.081 --> 17:56.037
No, you're an intern.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.436
- I am?
- You can't switch your specialty...

17:58.601 --> 18:00.558
- ... without starting over.
- I've done a year.

18:00.722 --> 18:04.192
In Surgery. This is Emergency
Medicine. I thought you understood.

18:04.922 --> 18:09.121
We'll discuss this later when
we're not in the middle of all this.

18:10.963 --> 18:12.555
Where do you start?

18:13.083 --> 18:16.360
When you have to counsel family
about something like this?

18:16.564 --> 18:20.398
It's tricky. People are hearing
a lot of complex information.

18:20.604 --> 18:25.440
An Emergency resident, or intern, has
to establish a rapport with-

18:25.645 --> 18:27.840
- Excuse me, doctor.
- No, not at all.

18:28.005 --> 18:29.802
I was just coming in to see you.

18:30.526 --> 18:31.925
He's going to be admitted.

18:32.126 --> 18:34.959
You better call Transport.
They can take forever.

18:35.166 --> 18:38.523
We should talk about your husband's
condition. Excuse me.

18:38.727 --> 18:41.161
Chuny, can I see that chart
for a second?

18:42.527 --> 18:46.567
If I go too fast, or if you have
any questions, please stop me.

18:46.768 --> 18:51.205
I know he's had laser treatments to
enlarge the opening of the esophagus.

18:51.408 --> 18:52.602
For all the good it did.

18:52.768 --> 18:54.680
A feeding tube can be inserted-

18:54.889 --> 18:56.527
The cancer eats right through it.

18:56.729 --> 18:58.208
There's an option, the J-tube-

18:58.409 --> 19:02.608
We're not screwing around with that.
The sucker's on his aorta. He's dead.

19:03.530 --> 19:07.842
If you feel that way, you might want
to have your husband sign a DNR.

19:08.050 --> 19:10.201
- It's a "Do Not Resuscitate" order-
- Yeah.

19:10.411 --> 19:11.969
I got it.

19:12.531 --> 19:15.682
There was one by his bed,
but Rog sort of freaked.

19:17.652 --> 19:21.008
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We tried to ask him.

19:21.212 --> 19:26.003
I was just out buying garlic
and herbs. Boz's food.

19:27.053 --> 19:29.931
But all he can do now
is smell it anyways.

19:30.293 --> 19:33.206
I hold it under his nose
and he smells.

19:38.334 --> 19:40.405
Wanna hear about our sex life?

19:41.055 --> 19:45.253
If there's anything I can answer,
or if there's anything you need...

19:46.255 --> 19:50.329
Yeah. I'm on Librium.
Can you write me a refill?

19:52.616 --> 19:55.085
The mother wants
to call Animal Control.

19:55.297 --> 19:57.015
Well, this ought to be fun.

20:00.777 --> 20:02.894
- I've had JoJo for nine years.
- He's vicious.

20:03.098 --> 20:06.215
- He's never bitten anyone.
- He hasn't been around children.

20:06.418 --> 20:08.136
Could you give it a rest?

20:08.338 --> 20:10.899
- See who's lying here?
- Did you call Animal Control?

20:11.059 --> 20:12.174
Just take a breath.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.812
This is our daughter!

20:14.019 --> 20:16.294
Dr. Ross is just gonna take a look.

20:16.499 --> 20:19.219
You're supposed to call
Animal Control with bites.

20:19.420 --> 20:21.376
Can you pull that light over here?

20:21.580 --> 20:23.252
I know, sweetheart. Hang on.

20:23.460 --> 20:25.291
Did you see how the bite happened?

20:25.500 --> 20:29.494
My son did. I'd run out to get
the phone, the dog just went for her.

20:29.701 --> 20:31.692
- How bad does it look?
- It's deep.

20:31.901 --> 20:33.699
She'll need intravenous antibiotics.

20:33.902 --> 20:36.894
- Intravenous?
- Yeah. That's not a canine bite.

20:37.062 --> 20:40.418
- What?
- It's from an immature Homo sapien.

20:40.622 --> 20:43.501
That's one who still has
his primary incisors.

20:43.703 --> 20:44.897
Todd?

20:45.103 --> 20:47.298
Did you bite your sister?

20:48.383 --> 20:50.818
- It's okay.
- Why would you do such a thing?

20:51.024 --> 20:53.060
You know you love your sister.

20:53.304 --> 20:55.260
- He gets a hug for this?
- Wait here.

20:55.464 --> 20:57.820
If you and I can speak
out in the hallway...

20:57.985 --> 21:00.021
How did you get burns on your
hands and lips?

21:00.225 --> 21:04.617
- I already told her.
- She was making popcorn, it exploded.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.820
Her resting pulse is 120
and she's tremulous.

21:08.026 --> 21:09.698
You should lay off the crack.

21:09.906 --> 21:11.658
I don't do that stuff.

21:12.187 --> 21:15.304
- You want a tox screen?
- Do you wanna stop doing crack?

21:15.507 --> 21:17.065
Go away, man.

21:17.307 --> 21:21.506
I don't think taxpayers are interested
in buying Doris a tox screen.

21:21.708 --> 21:23.744
Let's update her tetanus,
dress the burns...

21:23.948 --> 21:26.940
...and have her checked in
the surgical clinic in two days.

21:27.148 --> 21:28.662
She also has an upset stomach.

21:28.869 --> 21:30.905
- What have you eaten today?
- Nothing.

21:31.109 --> 21:33.304
Nothing. Not even popcorn?

21:34.069 --> 21:36.220
You gotta eat right
and stop the drugs.

21:36.430 --> 21:38.864
- It's none of your business!
- See you next time.

21:39.070 --> 21:42.028
You didn't see any reason
to confirm her drug use?

21:42.230 --> 21:44.062
- Dr. Greene's a busy man.
- Yes.

21:44.271 --> 21:48.310
- A lot of responsibility, pressure.
- He sure does. That's the chart.

21:48.511 --> 21:49.546
How does he handle it?

21:49.751 --> 21:51.629
You're gonna have to ask him that.

21:54.472 --> 21:56.702
Sir? Sir, we have
a bed for you now.

21:56.912 --> 21:59.381
We'll get to you
as soon as possible.

22:02.433 --> 22:04.867
- Soul food.
- Ask Lydia. It's her birthday.

22:06.474 --> 22:08.749
Did you see my doctor?
Where's the doctor?

22:08.954 --> 22:10.706
The doctor will see you soon.

22:10.914 --> 22:13.303
I need a doctor.

22:17.075 --> 22:20.784
Peter! Hey! Peter!
Peter! Wake up!

22:21.075 --> 22:24.512
Double trauma coming in.
Teenager, a victim of a gang beating.

22:24.716 --> 22:27.947
And a bystander who tried to stop it.
They're both critical.

22:28.156 --> 22:32.309
- Have you seen Mark?
- No. I'll meet him in Trauma 2.

22:33.717 --> 22:35.309
So how did they find out?

22:35.517 --> 22:37.827
I don't know. Police report, gossip.

22:38.038 --> 22:40.154
It doesn't matter.
I'm not talking about it.

22:40.358 --> 22:42.030
That's good policy, man.

22:42.238 --> 22:43.956
- What's the score?
- It's 8-1.

22:44.158 --> 22:46.514
Cubs behind, bottom of the seventh.

22:47.079 --> 22:51.072
You can't get mad at them on camera.
They go for that stuff like sharks.

22:51.319 --> 22:56.075
They wanna make a tearjerker with me
as the pathetic, victimized doctor.

22:56.320 --> 22:59.073
That's not what I mean.
I was watching that director.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.509
She was looking at you.

23:00.721 --> 23:03.440
She's watching you.
Trying to get personal and stuff.

23:03.641 --> 23:06.951
You go for that too, the intense,
kind of brainy type.

23:07.161 --> 23:08.993
She's married to the camera guy.

23:09.202 --> 23:11.670
- The old guy?
- Yeah. They're a pair.

23:12.282 --> 23:14.034
May-Decembers. Never hold up.

23:14.242 --> 23:16.199
You guys talking about the filmmakers?

23:16.483 --> 23:17.552
We don't trust them.

23:17.763 --> 23:18.957
They're bloodsuckers.

23:19.163 --> 23:21.518
Should you be doing that
in front of the camera?

23:25.004 --> 23:28.679
- Is that on?
- Doug, Mark! Got a double trauma!

23:32.525 --> 23:33.594
Help my brother.

23:33.765 --> 23:36.074
Fourteen-year-old, blunt trauma
from baseball bats.

23:36.245 --> 23:37.360
- Bats?
- They jumped him.

23:37.525 --> 23:40.086
Pulse 130. BP 100/60.

23:41.886 --> 23:46.802
We got a 30-year-old victim of a
15-foot-fall onto a concrete surface.

23:47.007 --> 23:49.601
Brief loss of consciousness
at scene, cleared en route.

23:49.807 --> 23:52.002
Now alert and oriented.
Occipital hematoma.

23:52.207 --> 23:54.198
BP 60 palp. Pulse 120.

23:54.368 --> 23:57.360
Flaccid paralysis in all four
extremities with loss of sensation.

23:57.568 --> 24:00.401
Call Neurology
and get X-ray down here.

24:00.888 --> 24:04.643
On my count. One, two, three.

24:04.969 --> 24:07.085
CBC, type and cross four units.

24:07.329 --> 24:10.322
Lateral C-spine, chest
and pelvis. Let's move.

24:10.530 --> 24:12.088
Can you feel anything anywhere?

24:12.290 --> 24:15.043
No. Not a bit. Is that okay?

24:15.210 --> 24:17.485
He's got good breath sounds,
diminished tidal volume.

24:17.651 --> 24:19.881
- BP's 60 palp.
- We need a path here.

24:20.091 --> 24:21.683
It could be spinal shock.

24:21.891 --> 24:23.847
Let's rule out
intra-abdominal bleeding.

24:24.051 --> 24:26.361
Let's set up.
Let's get a lap! Move!

24:26.572 --> 24:28.642
What else should we order,
Dr. Del Amico?

24:28.852 --> 24:30.763
- High-dose steroids.
- And why?

24:30.972 --> 24:34.045
Improves motor function and sensation
after spinal cord injuries.

24:34.253 --> 24:35.686
Spinal cord?! Wait.

24:35.893 --> 24:40.091
- Would somebody shut that guy up?!
- We're trying to assess your injuries.

24:40.453 --> 24:42.092
How much do you weigh?

24:43.174 --> 24:46.007
Call me Theo, all right?
I'm 165.

24:46.214 --> 24:48.934
It's negative.
I'm gonna go check on the kid.

24:49.135 --> 24:52.923
All right. Start dopamine at 10 mcgs.
We're out of the woods.

24:53.135 --> 24:57.652
Theo, we need to check your motor
responses. Okay, Dr. Del Amico?

24:58.096 --> 25:00.291
Sir, can you squeeze my hand?

25:01.296 --> 25:02.695
What's wrong with me?

25:02.896 --> 25:05.331
Can you shrug
your shoulders, please?

25:08.017 --> 25:10.485
We wanna talk to him.
See if he's okay.

25:10.697 --> 25:13.371
Chairs. You have to sit in Chairs.

25:13.578 --> 25:15.296
It ain't got nothing to do with you.

25:15.498 --> 25:19.207
- They tailgated me all the way here.
- Where's Chico, huh?

25:21.259 --> 25:24.456
I'll go see if your friend's okay.
Just wait here, okay?

25:25.739 --> 25:28.891
- Is my brother gonna be okay?
- Mannitol, 75 grams.

25:29.100 --> 25:30.897
Blown left pupil.
He's hyperventilating.

25:31.100 --> 25:32.499
Intracranial hemorrhage.

25:33.060 --> 25:36.098
- Call for a stat head CT.
- Decorticate posturing. GCS, 8.

25:36.261 --> 25:37.580
It was 12 in the field.

25:37.781 --> 25:41.740
Randi's got a situation at the desk.
Don't bring that kid to CT right now.

25:41.901 --> 25:43.335
- Why not?
- His homeys are there.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.180
They came here?

25:45.382 --> 25:46.940
Those bastards!

25:54.383 --> 25:56.135
You stay away from him, okay?

25:56.343 --> 25:58.619
- Take it outside!
- Just stay away!

25:58.824 --> 26:00.098
Your brother's a ranker.

26:00.264 --> 26:03.779
You almost killed him!
What more do you want?!

26:03.984 --> 26:06.977
You know? Call the cops!
They're murderers!

26:07.185 --> 26:10.177
They did it. You pushed that guy
right over the rail!

26:10.385 --> 26:12.455
You didn't even know that man!

26:12.665 --> 26:15.817
He was just trying to help,
and you pushed him over!

26:16.026 --> 26:18.301
All he wanted was a chance!

26:28.427 --> 26:30.896
At the moment, his
C-4 nerve, the one...

26:31.108 --> 26:34.384
...between the fourth and fifth
vertebrae, is still functioning.

26:34.588 --> 26:38.104
Meaning he can move his diaphragm
and shrug his shoulders.

26:38.309 --> 26:41.301
But if the swelling continues,
then he becomes a C-3.

26:41.509 --> 26:44.502
He will lose the ability
to breathe on his own.

26:45.230 --> 26:48.825
How is the shooting going?
Are you getting everything you need?

26:49.030 --> 26:51.260
Yeah, I think so. It's been good.

26:51.510 --> 26:56.380
I noticed that you might be missing
the importance of women-

26:56.791 --> 26:58.065
Excuse me.

26:59.551 --> 27:01.543
Women working in the ER.

27:01.752 --> 27:06.701
It's changed dramatically over the last
few years. All kinds of diversity...

27:06.912 --> 27:10.792
...among medical workers. It's crucial
to how Emergency Medicine evolves.

27:10.993 --> 27:13.268
I'll mention that to Agi and Stuart.

27:14.153 --> 27:16.304
What was that you were pointing to?

27:16.514 --> 27:17.742
- Here?
- Yeah.

27:17.914 --> 27:22.112
This is a fracture of the fourth
and fifth cervical vertebrae.

27:22.274 --> 27:23.788
What does that mean?

27:23.995 --> 27:26.953
That Mr. Williams,
who tried to be a Good Samaritan...

27:27.155 --> 27:30.352
...and stop a young man he didn't know
from being beaten to death...

27:30.555 --> 27:32.990
...is now paralyzed
from the neck down.

27:33.196 --> 27:35.994
- Kerry, may I interrupt?
- David, come on in! Come in.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.472
- I'd rather-
- This is Dr. Morgenstern...

27:38.677 --> 27:42.226
...our too-modest
Chief of Emergency Services.

27:42.437 --> 27:45.509
If you're here about our little
altercation, it's settled.

27:45.717 --> 27:48.915
- The police subdued the perpetrators-
- The police?

27:50.078 --> 27:51.909
David, you're diaphoretic.

27:54.759 --> 27:56.317
- Is something wrong?
- Chest pain.

27:56.519 --> 27:59.317
- Radiating?
- To the jaw, started 20 minutes ago.

27:59.519 --> 28:03.229
Oh, my God. Lie down. Lie down.
Let's get you on a monitor.

28:03.440 --> 28:04.998
Here you go. Gently.

28:05.200 --> 28:08.158
You get out. Out!
Get out! Out!

28:08.360 --> 28:11.512
Lydia! Lydia! Grab me
some atropine, nitro...

28:11.721 --> 28:14.679
- ... and a 12-lead EKG!
- Oh, my God!

28:14.921 --> 28:17.720
Pulse ox monitor and start a line.

28:18.682 --> 28:21.913
Here you go, David.
We're gonna take good care of you.

28:25.123 --> 28:26.158
How about there?

28:26.363 --> 28:28.433
No. Nothing.

28:30.843 --> 28:32.276
Anything at all?

28:32.483 --> 28:33.883
No, ma'am.

28:35.124 --> 28:36.352
Will the feeling come back?

28:36.564 --> 28:38.953
That's what the doctors
are trying to find out.

28:40.845 --> 28:43.120
- Felt that.
- Good. Mark it.

28:43.325 --> 28:45.475
Sir, we'll have to watch you
very closely.

28:45.685 --> 28:50.282
If the swelling continues,
we'll have to put you on a ventilator.

28:50.486 --> 28:54.365
I got a hold of a babysitter at your
house, your wife's at school.

28:54.566 --> 28:58.719
Right. It's Thursday.
She won't get in until midnight.

28:58.927 --> 29:00.679
We'll get a message to her.

29:00.887 --> 29:03.766
Get that babysitter
on the phone, now.

29:04.728 --> 29:07.765
Malik! Malik! Hold on!

29:07.968 --> 29:10.357
- I'll bring it back!
- I need it now.

29:10.568 --> 29:13.606
- Kerry, I was about to-
- It's David Morgenstern.

29:27.611 --> 29:30.125
It's the kid that got
beat up earlier.

29:30.331 --> 29:31.923
It may be his spleen.

29:32.131 --> 29:33.723
Is it the kid with the head trauma?

29:33.931 --> 29:35.126
You have to get in line.

29:35.372 --> 29:38.125
- I need a CT.
- Drill the burrholes up in the O.R.

29:38.332 --> 29:40.129
- Where are you going?
- I'm bagging him.

29:40.332 --> 29:41.321
Not anymore. Go.

29:41.532 --> 29:43.569
- Dr. Benton.
- Thank you.

29:45.813 --> 29:48.247
He's a little disappointed
I left Surgery.

29:48.453 --> 29:51.730
I'm Miss Corday. Could you
point me towards Casualty?

29:51.934 --> 29:53.925
Sorry. "Trauma. "
I mean Trauma.

29:54.094 --> 29:56.005
Trauma's that way.
You need help?

29:56.214 --> 29:59.446
- I'll call out if I get lost.
- You okay?

29:59.655 --> 30:01.532
Kid was trying to get out of a gang.

30:01.695 --> 30:04.926
You're in the ER. Get them on the
elevator alive, you've done your job.

30:05.135 --> 30:06.455
How do you think he'll do?

30:06.656 --> 30:09.807
A blown left pupil, probably
means a chronic vegetative state.

30:10.016 --> 30:12.484
If he doesn't bleed to death first.

30:13.417 --> 30:14.566
How bad's he look?

30:14.777 --> 30:19.692
His ST's are sky-high in two, three,
and F. His father had an Ml at 40.

30:19.977 --> 30:21.297
Yeah, I'll hold.

30:21.658 --> 30:23.888
- I wonder if we could talk now.
- Later.

30:24.098 --> 30:27.170
He's throwing multifocal PVCs.
Should we give him lidocaine?

30:27.378 --> 30:29.847
Cath lab's ready for us.
Let's get him up!

30:31.739 --> 30:34.094
I wonder if you're aware
of my situation-

30:34.299 --> 30:37.019
- I got the babysitter.
- Later, Carter.

30:37.420 --> 30:38.614
Excuse me, Lily.

30:39.900 --> 30:41.697
Is this the Williams' sitter?

30:41.900 --> 30:45.780
This is Dr. Greene from the Emergency
Room at County General Hospital.

30:45.981 --> 30:47.733
Do you understand me?

30:48.501 --> 30:52.097
How far away are you from where
Mrs. Williams goes to school?

30:52.822 --> 30:56.053
Good. Get a neighbor to watch
the baby and run there...

30:56.262 --> 30:58.093
...as fast as you can, and get her.

30:58.302 --> 31:01.340
Tell her it's an emergency
and every minute counts.

31:01.543 --> 31:04.774
Put her in a cab. We're about
a 10-minute ride away.

31:05.503 --> 31:06.902
You got all that?

31:07.184 --> 31:09.903
Any questions? Good. Go.

31:11.024 --> 31:12.742
Is he losing his ability to breathe?

31:12.944 --> 31:15.982
The rate his pulse ox is falling,
I'll need to intubate.

31:16.185 --> 31:18.904
You need the wife here
to sign a consent?

31:19.105 --> 31:21.903
He's paralyzed, probably
for the rest of his life.

31:22.105 --> 31:23.334
Right now he can speak.

31:23.546 --> 31:28.461
It would be nice if he and his wife
could talk, while he still can.

31:28.906 --> 31:31.216
Theo, can you take
a deep breath for me?

31:33.667 --> 31:36.056
- I'll go get Dr. Greene.
- Good idea.

31:36.267 --> 31:39.578
Excuse me. I'm Miss Corday.
I was bleeped down for a consult.

31:39.788 --> 31:41.187
Are you a doctor?

31:41.908 --> 31:42.943
Oh, don't mind them.

31:43.148 --> 31:45.378
These gentlemen are making a movie.

31:45.588 --> 31:48.308
I'm a surgical lecturer
in Orthopedics and Trauma.

31:48.509 --> 31:50.545
There was an adolescent
who decompensated?

31:50.749 --> 31:52.546
Dr. Benton took him up.

31:52.749 --> 31:55.469
Dr. Benton.
You call your surgeons "doctor. "

31:55.670 --> 31:57.900
"Miss Corday" won't get
me very far around here.

31:58.110 --> 32:00.340
Just to the Waiting Room.
I'm Carol Hathaway.

32:00.550 --> 32:01.586
It's a pleasure.

32:01.791 --> 32:04.464
How did he look?
The boy with the positive lavage?

32:04.671 --> 32:06.627
Not good. Blown pupil, deep coma.

32:06.831 --> 32:08.344
This is the kid I saved?

32:08.551 --> 32:10.110
- Yeah.
- Oh, man!

32:10.312 --> 32:12.223
We're keeping our fingers crossed.

32:14.432 --> 32:17.345
Are you still experiencing
the same amount of pain?

32:17.553 --> 32:21.626
Okay, on a scale of one to 10,
how would you rate that pain?

32:23.353 --> 32:26.630
Pardon? Eight. Okay, let's
get him on very gently.

32:26.834 --> 32:29.189
They're set up for us
and know we're coming.

32:29.394 --> 32:30.622
- Here we go.
- What the hell?

32:30.794 --> 32:31.909
Hey, what are you doing?

32:32.115 --> 32:33.833
No! I asked you not to.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.593
- You going to the Cath Lab?
- Yes.

32:35.795 --> 32:37.911
Isn't there another patient
who's been waiting?

32:38.075 --> 32:39.064
What do you mean?

32:39.235 --> 32:42.308
Do some patients get preferential
treatment in the ER?

32:42.876 --> 32:44.104
Look at me.

32:44.476 --> 32:46.194
I'm talking to you.
Is this recording?

32:46.396 --> 32:50.470
Are you a doctor? Do you have
experience with myocardial infarctions?

32:50.677 --> 32:52.349
- How is he doing?
- Sinus rhythm-

32:52.557 --> 32:56.107
Then how can you make an
accusation about patient treatment?

32:56.318 --> 32:59.310
Your camera sees a picture
of one man going to the Cath Lab...

32:59.518 --> 33:01.315
...so you assume
preferential treatment?

33:01.518 --> 33:06.035
Do you know ST elevations? Is there
another patient who had V-tach?

33:06.239 --> 33:07.877
- I don't know.
- How's the ectopy?

33:08.079 --> 33:10.070
- Under five per minute.
- What do you want?

33:10.239 --> 33:11.878
What can we tell you?

33:12.560 --> 33:16.030
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

33:16.240 --> 33:17.673
You did.

33:23.921 --> 33:26.914
- What do you got?
- Eighty-two-year-old male.

33:27.122 --> 33:30.034
Shocked twice without success.
Shall I defibrillate?

33:30.242 --> 33:32.312
- Be my guest.
- Charge it to 360.

33:32.522 --> 33:34.241
- Has he had epi?
- Three minutes ago.

33:34.403 --> 33:35.677
- Go ahead.
- Juice it up.

33:37.723 --> 33:40.954
- Three-sixty. Clear!
- Agi, I need a battery.

33:41.163 --> 33:43.314
Another 50 of lidocaine.
Again, 360.

33:44.324 --> 33:47.919
- Agi, my camera battery's dying.
- Keep shooting.

33:48.564 --> 33:50.044
- Got a rhythm.
- Pulse?

33:50.245 --> 33:51.724
Faint. But it's there.

33:53.285 --> 33:55.435
- We gotta bag him.
- I'm losing power.

33:55.645 --> 33:57.159
How does that feel, doctor?

33:57.366 --> 34:00.915
To bring somebody back?
Oh, that's the... That's the...

34:07.207 --> 34:08.764
- Dr. Benton?
- Yeah?

34:08.967 --> 34:12.880
Elizabeth Corday. Visiting
surgical lecturer and your savior.

34:13.047 --> 34:14.879
- Excuse me?
- You've been on call forever.

34:15.047 --> 34:18.960
- You're free to go. I'm on now.
- I'm sorry.

34:19.168 --> 34:21.888
Are you the doctor who was
taking care of my brother?

34:22.089 --> 34:25.764
- You still down here?
- Yeah. I had to talk to the cops.

34:27.409 --> 34:30.322
- How is he?
- They removed his spleen.

34:30.530 --> 34:32.327
The neurosurgeons are still working.

34:32.530 --> 34:33.849
Does he have brain damage?

34:34.050 --> 34:36.121
Let's call and see if there's news.

34:36.331 --> 34:37.730
Here we go.

34:37.971 --> 34:39.290
I thought I was a goner.

34:39.491 --> 34:40.969
Yeah? Me too.

34:41.170 --> 34:46.041
You'll get a lot of thank-yous from
the female population at Riverview.

34:46.252 --> 34:49.527
- I don't wanna brag, but...
- You a popular guy over there?

34:49.732 --> 34:52.929
Well, I seem to be...

34:53.893 --> 34:56.487
I never was much of a Casanova
in my day.

34:56.693 --> 35:01.051
I didn't go in for all the wild
positions and so forth.

35:01.254 --> 35:03.449
Ladies need that. All the positions.

35:03.654 --> 35:05.133
So I've heard.

35:05.334 --> 35:08.930
And the sweet talk.
I never was much for that either.

35:09.135 --> 35:12.207
I was mostly meat and potatoes.

35:12.415 --> 35:16.170
But now I'm 82. I'm a man.
I'm breathing.

35:16.376 --> 35:19.129
The odds are 12-to-1 in my favor.

35:19.336 --> 35:21.930
I'm getting it anytime I want.

35:22.817 --> 35:24.728
Not too bad, old age.

35:24.937 --> 35:26.848
I'm glad to hear it.
Glad to hear it.

35:27.057 --> 35:31.529
It feels good to save a man who's
performing such a service to society.

35:32.738 --> 35:34.649
Stud service.

35:35.538 --> 35:37.051
Get that in.

35:38.979 --> 35:41.095
He was found outside
the Stones concert.

35:41.299 --> 35:44.291
It looked like he fell
through a sheet of plate glass.

35:44.499 --> 35:45.649
- Easy.
- No, no, no.

35:45.860 --> 35:47.452
- We're just gonna-
- No, no!

35:47.660 --> 35:49.890
- It's okay.
- No! Don't touch me!

35:50.100 --> 35:51.772
- Get Security.
- Security!

35:51.980 --> 35:54.017
- Everything's okay.
- Get away from me.

35:54.221 --> 35:55.620
It's all right. Just relax.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.413
No! Stay away from me!

35:57.621 --> 35:59.020
It's all right.

35:59.221 --> 36:01.338
I'm sick, okay?
Just stay away from me.

36:01.542 --> 36:03.021
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

36:03.222 --> 36:06.020
I'm sick! I'm HIV-positive.

36:06.222 --> 36:08.896
I've got AIDS.
Just stay away from me!

36:09.943 --> 36:12.503
- Please. No, no, no.
- It's okay. Okay.

36:12.703 --> 36:13.931
Stop!

36:14.143 --> 36:16.533
Okay. All right?

36:17.784 --> 36:19.297
Just lay back and let us help.

36:19.504 --> 36:20.903
- Don't.
- It's okay.

36:21.104 --> 36:23.413
- It itches.
- I know it itches. All right.

36:23.624 --> 36:25.616
Just take it away.

36:26.345 --> 36:29.576
I'll take it away. Okay?
Lay back. It's okay.

36:29.905 --> 36:31.054
Come on.

36:32.306 --> 36:34.262
- We'll make it better.
- Help me.

36:34.466 --> 36:36.900
I'll do what I can.
I'll do what I can.

36:42.787 --> 36:45.620
So when did you decide
to become a surgeon?

36:45.987 --> 36:49.344
Well, that gets into pleasing
my father, rattling my mother...

36:49.548 --> 36:51.698
...and all sorts of boring
family secrets.

36:51.908 --> 36:55.345
The short answer is, my father
is a surgeon, as was his father.

36:55.549 --> 36:57.619
And my father had no sons.

36:57.829 --> 37:00.184
Are you a resident in the U.K.?

37:00.589 --> 37:02.899
It's a different system altogether.

37:03.110 --> 37:07.467
I'm an FRCS, a Fellow of the Royal
College of Surgeons, and a lecturer.

37:07.670 --> 37:10.902
That's roughly the equivalent
of senior surgical residents.

37:11.111 --> 37:13.864
But not really
because I have six...

37:14.071 --> 37:16.824
I'm sorry. You can't possibly
be interested in this.

37:17.031 --> 37:20.991
Dr. Benton, please rescue me
from these well-intentioned people.

37:21.192 --> 37:23.069
We're talking about surgical service.

37:23.272 --> 37:25.661
Have you seen that young lady
I was talking to?

37:25.873 --> 37:28.546
- The sister of the boy up in Surgery?
- I got some news.

37:28.753 --> 37:30.027
I'll keep my eyes open.

37:34.874 --> 37:36.227
Paralyzed?

37:36.754 --> 37:37.948
For good?

37:38.314 --> 37:42.706
It's too early to say if he'll
have any recovery of function.

37:44.195 --> 37:47.904
- What did he think he was doing?
- He was trying to save a boy's life.

37:48.515 --> 37:50.950
- I know.
- He's very eager to talk to you.

37:51.156 --> 37:53.147
I'm afraid it'll have to be brief.

37:54.036 --> 37:55.389
Just give me a second.

37:56.316 --> 37:58.035
I wouldn't wanna be in those shoes.

37:58.237 --> 37:59.716
Whose? Mark's or the wife's?

37:59.917 --> 38:01.270
Neither.

38:04.358 --> 38:07.748
Sometimes I hesitate with a family
before I give the news.

38:07.958 --> 38:10.756
I'm gonna say something
that will change their lives.

38:10.958 --> 38:13.837
If you don't say it, it'll be okay
for a little while.

38:14.039 --> 38:17.395
I told this one mother
that her son had been killed.

38:17.599 --> 38:19.715
And she said, "Is it broken? "

38:20.440 --> 38:23.113
I'm looking at her and I didn't
know what she was saying.

38:23.320 --> 38:27.997
So she said, "His arm, is it broken?
It's his pitching arm. "

38:28.201 --> 38:29.919
And she just walked away.

38:30.121 --> 38:32.157
Did you just let her leave like that?

38:32.361 --> 38:34.795
I called Carol.
I had her take care of it.

38:35.001 --> 38:36.560
That's a true story.

38:38.082 --> 38:40.960
At least...
At least we...

38:41.522 --> 38:45.436
...shot those videos of us
on the playground, me and him, huh?

38:46.203 --> 38:48.717
I guess it's a good thing.

38:48.923 --> 38:53.520
I mean, TG'll be able to see what his
daddy looked like or used to be like.

38:53.724 --> 38:56.318
You're gonna be that way again.
You hear me, Theo?

38:56.524 --> 38:59.039
We are not giving up that easy, okay?

38:59.245 --> 39:03.204
His blood gas showed PO-2, 65
and PCA 250.

39:03.405 --> 39:05.202
We're standing by with Versed.

39:05.405 --> 39:07.078
Dr. Carter needs you now!

39:07.286 --> 39:10.517
I'll be there in a minute.
I'm afraid we have to interrupt.

39:10.726 --> 39:11.795
Just another minute?

39:12.006 --> 39:14.123
Can you have somebody drive her home?

39:14.327 --> 39:16.921
Stop bossing me around.
I'm staying here.

39:17.127 --> 39:19.721
- Pulse ox is down to 89.
- He's getting dusky.

39:19.927 --> 39:21.565
Two of Versed.

39:22.568 --> 39:24.524
We can't wait any longer.

39:24.928 --> 39:28.443
Once this sedative takes effect,
I'll intubate your husband.

39:28.648 --> 39:32.085
When you wake up, you're gonna
have a tube helping you to breathe.

39:32.289 --> 39:33.517
Mind if we interrupt?

39:33.729 --> 39:35.799
Miss Cruz's brother
came out of surgery.

39:36.009 --> 39:37.648
The head CT showed no bleeding.

39:37.850 --> 39:39.727
That is really good news. Thanks.

39:39.930 --> 39:42.364
The boy? The boy's gonna be okay?

39:42.570 --> 39:45.927
Yes, sir. Thank you.
You saved my brother's life.

39:46.131 --> 39:47.530
That's good.

39:49.811 --> 39:51.369
Can you feel that, honey?

40:05.533 --> 40:06.932
I'm in.

40:08.774 --> 40:10.287
Is he breathing?

40:10.654 --> 40:12.531
We're breathing for him now.

40:12.734 --> 40:14.611
Dr. Greene, you need to come now!

40:14.814 --> 40:16.168
Excuse me.

40:23.536 --> 40:26.050
- What happened?
- He went into fib. Clear!

40:26.256 --> 40:29.168
He went into asystole.
I've given high-dose epi and atropine.

40:29.376 --> 40:31.288
- Charge, 360.
- Why didn't you call me?

40:31.497 --> 40:32.771
- I did!
- Two minutes ago.

40:32.977 --> 40:34.126
Clear!

40:34.857 --> 40:38.486
I was following ACLS algorithms.
I thought I could handle it.

40:38.697 --> 40:40.177
- Charge!
- Go ahead and call it.

40:40.378 --> 40:43.575
- Clear! Charge it again.
- Call it, Dr. Carter!

40:48.859 --> 40:49.974
Time of death is 9:56.

40:50.179 --> 40:54.092
Call an Attending when there's
a full arrest! You get help!

40:54.299 --> 40:58.009
- I've run them before.
- That was Surgery. You work here now.

41:06.541 --> 41:08.020
Did I miss anything?

41:09.501 --> 41:11.140
Not that I can see.

41:14.342 --> 41:16.776
Sorry, I didn't think
I was gonna lose him.

41:19.583 --> 41:22.416
- I'll sign the code sheet.
- I'll do it.

41:38.185 --> 41:39.857
Do you want that interview?

41:40.065 --> 41:42.057
- Do you?
- You'll answer our questions?

41:42.266 --> 41:45.064
- If you don't use what you just shot.
- The walk away?

41:45.266 --> 41:48.657
The whole thing. Him losing
the patient and me chewing him out.

41:48.827 --> 41:49.816
It wasn't bad.

41:49.987 --> 41:52.740
- Do you want the interview?
- Yes.

41:53.387 --> 41:55.662
Look, I need a death kit in here.

42:10.429 --> 42:15.345
Probably the best part of my job
is that sometimes working here...

42:15.670 --> 42:17.945
...you can repair
some of the violence.

42:18.150 --> 42:20.711
Some of the bad things
that happen to people.

42:21.391 --> 42:22.744
Not always.

42:23.151 --> 42:26.302
We couldn't do much for that guy
who was paralyzed.

42:26.511 --> 42:29.106
Probably on a vent
for the rest of his life.

42:30.032 --> 42:33.820
I guess we did save the kid
that he was trying to help.

42:34.152 --> 42:36.667
So his sacrifice wasn't for nothing.

42:38.393 --> 42:41.590
And yes, I was attacked myself...

42:41.793 --> 42:43.671
...right here in this hospital.

42:44.834 --> 42:47.712
They haven't been able
to catch the guy who did it.

42:47.914 --> 42:50.634
At least, they haven't been able
to charge anyone.

42:53.195 --> 42:57.154
The worst thing about it
isn't what it did to me.

42:58.796 --> 43:02.391
The worst thing is, it meant
that some of the world's violence...

43:02.596 --> 43:04.587
...has leaked into our own ER.

43:05.316 --> 43:09.196
This is meant to be a safe place
for fixing people.

43:10.117 --> 43:11.709
Now it's vulnerable.

43:12.557 --> 43:16.710
And as an ER doctor,
that's hard to accept.

43:17.438 --> 43:18.871
It sounds frightening.

43:20.238 --> 43:21.718
Are you scared?

43:22.359 --> 43:23.508
Sure.

43:25.319 --> 43:27.116
Of losing control.

43:27.519 --> 43:29.715
Control of what's outside?

43:31.520 --> 43:33.272
And what's in me.

43:37.441 --> 43:39.511
- Is that enough?
- Yeah.

43:40.441 --> 43:41.954
Then turn it off.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
