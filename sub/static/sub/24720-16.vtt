00:00.020 --> 00:02.000
Previously on Elementary:
These photos...

00:02.090 --> 00:03.390
they’re of
a sensitive nature.

00:03.990 --> 00:05.110
If they prove you’re innocent,

00:05.110 --> 00:06.689
I’m pretty sure
we’re done with you.

00:06.689 --> 00:10.400
That’s what you were doing
the night Azuma was killed?

00:10.400 --> 00:11.990
It relieves stress.

00:11.990 --> 00:12.990
Detective Marcus Bell?

00:12.990 --> 00:15.530
Deputy Strider Lincoln,
U.S. Marshals Service.

00:15.530 --> 00:16.690
My bosses hear good
things about you.

00:16.690 --> 00:19.030
They’d like you to consider
putting in an application.

00:19.030 --> 00:20.820
But if you decide to
see this thing through,

00:20.820 --> 00:21.690
I’d be so proud of you.

00:21.690 --> 00:24.030
I put in my application
to the Marshals Service.

00:24.030 --> 00:27.030
I report to training
at Glynco in six months.

00:27.030 --> 00:28.240
(sighs)

00:28.240 --> 00:30.740
I’m gonna miss you.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.950
BELL:
I understand that, but...

00:36.950 --> 00:41.360
like I said before,
it has to be a mistake.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.150
Well, I-I can’t,
because it’s the only time

00:43.150 --> 00:47.690
you’re offering it right now,
and I’m in a real crunch.

00:47.690 --> 00:50.700
Well, what time
does she get in?

00:50.700 --> 00:52.240
Okay, I will.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.690
Thanks.

00:53.690 --> 00:54.780
That didn’t sound good.

00:54.780 --> 00:57.860
It wasn’t. Turns out
finishing my master’s in time

00:57.860 --> 01:00.690
to apply for the Marshals
this next cycle--

01:00.690 --> 01:01.690
easier said than done.

01:01.690 --> 01:03.400
I don’t understand.
I thought you took

01:03.400 --> 01:05.450
some of the courses
you already need.

01:05.450 --> 01:06.360
Don’t those count?

01:06.360 --> 01:07.610
They do, and the school gave me

01:07.610 --> 01:09.690
a ton of credits
for applicable work experience,

01:09.690 --> 01:11.690
but that still leaves
a lot of classes.

01:11.690 --> 01:12.990
And getting them done in time

01:12.990 --> 01:14.690
while working
a full load here--

01:14.690 --> 01:16.690
it’s like solving
a logic puzzle.

01:16.690 --> 01:18.690
Anyway, I still need
a few more credits

01:18.690 --> 01:21.110
in Criminal Statistics,
and there’s only one class

01:21.110 --> 01:23.240
that fits the bill
this semester.

01:23.240 --> 01:24.690
And you didn’t get in.

01:24.690 --> 01:25.570
I registered for it,

01:25.570 --> 01:27.570
but I was told
it was already full.

01:27.570 --> 01:29.820
Then I found out
that a buddy of mine

01:29.820 --> 01:31.610
who registered after me got in.

01:31.610 --> 01:33.820
So the school messed up.
They should be able to fix that.

01:33.820 --> 01:36.690
We’ll see. I’m gonna head
down there tomorrow,

01:36.690 --> 01:38.740
talk to someone
who might be able to help.

01:38.740 --> 01:40.610
Well, with all of your
"applicable work experience,"

01:40.610 --> 01:43.070
I’m sure you’ll figure it out.
(cell phones chime)

01:43.070 --> 01:44.450
Did you get this
from Sherlock, too?

01:44.450 --> 01:46.570
He’s inviting us to a
crime scene in Queens.

01:46.570 --> 01:50.070
Gotta say, I’m kind of used
to being the one

01:50.070 --> 01:51.450
who does the inviting.

01:51.450 --> 01:54.950
Guess I’m old-fashioned
that way.

01:55.700 --> 01:58.690
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

02:01.490 --> 02:03.740
Heard some interesting chatter
on my police scanner.

02:03.740 --> 02:04.860
Thought I’d pop by.

02:04.860 --> 02:08.610
The victim is one
Bruce Deramore.

02:08.610 --> 02:09.449
Lived alone.

02:09.449 --> 02:11.360
Died of a single gunshot
to the chest.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.700
Cleaning lady found him.
She’s being interviewed outside.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.320
Anyone else see
or hear anything?

02:16.320 --> 02:18.280
Anyone? No.

02:18.690 --> 02:21.030
You’re being unusually cryptic,
even for you.

02:21.030 --> 02:22.360
BELL:
And you still
haven’t said

02:22.360 --> 02:24.530
what was so interesting
about the chatter.

02:24.530 --> 02:25.740
I saw there was
no forced entry.

02:25.740 --> 02:28.700
The killer left behind
all this expensive gear.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.690
So, sure, this was
probably personal,

02:30.690 --> 02:32.950
but that alone wouldn’t
rise to the level

02:32.950 --> 02:34.530
of you being interested
in this guy.

02:34.530 --> 02:37.700
Well, as it happens,
he isn’t what interested me.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.690
She is.

02:41.280 --> 02:42.820
Thank you.

02:43.490 --> 02:47.200
May I introduce Skyler.

02:49.690 --> 02:50.690
A sex doll?

02:50.690 --> 02:51.860
The chatter that I spoke about--

02:51.860 --> 02:54.110
it was a CSU tech
radioing for assistance

02:54.110 --> 02:55.780
lifting fingerprints
off silicone.

02:55.780 --> 02:58.950
I recognized the description
of the doll that followed.

02:58.950 --> 03:01.820
Man, I’m all for doing
whatever you want

03:01.820 --> 03:04.030
in the privacy of
your own home,

03:04.030 --> 03:05.700
but that is unsettling.

03:05.700 --> 03:07.690
You’re referring
to the uncanny valley.

03:07.690 --> 03:08.900
It’s the discomfort
one feels

03:08.900 --> 03:12.110
when an inanimate object
ventures too close

03:12.110 --> 03:12.780
to seeming real.

03:12.780 --> 03:15.490
She is a Perfect Mate
Robotics Model 10.

03:15.490 --> 03:16.360
A ten, naturally.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.780
Yeah, just the
thing if you’re up

03:17.780 --> 03:20.610
for having a relationship
with an appliance.

03:20.610 --> 03:24.240
Sex toys sell to the tune
of $15 billion a year,

03:24.240 --> 03:25.690
so, clearly, many people are.

03:25.690 --> 03:27.320
But the point is,
Perfect Mate 10s

03:27.320 --> 03:29.400
are not your
run-of-the-mill sex-bots.

03:29.400 --> 03:33.150
They are programmed to deliver
more of a girlfriend experience.

03:33.150 --> 03:34.900
They’re capable
of remembering your likes,

03:34.900 --> 03:37.240
your dislikes, details
of your conversations--

03:37.240 --> 03:40.280
all so as to simulate
a sense of relationship.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.690
Unlike many romantic partners,

03:42.690 --> 03:43.820
they actually listen.

03:43.820 --> 03:44.950
And because they listen...

03:44.950 --> 03:48.320
This sex doll could be
a witness to the murder.

03:52.740 --> 03:55.070
♪ ♪

03:56.570 --> 03:59.450
Thanks for taking the time
to meet with us, Mr. Lubbock.

03:59.450 --> 04:00.650
Dude, please.
I can’t tell you

04:00.650 --> 04:03.110
how bummed we all were
when we heard about Bruce.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.690
I expect getting
his chest blown open

04:04.690 --> 04:08.030
harshed Mr. Deramore’s
mellow as well.

04:08.570 --> 04:10.740
When we first saw the doll
at his apartment,

04:10.740 --> 04:12.490
we assumed that he
was just a customer,

04:12.490 --> 04:14.860
but then we found pay stubs
that helped us realize

04:14.860 --> 04:16.740
that he worked here at
Perfect Mate Robotics.

04:16.740 --> 04:20.690
Uh, he led the 3-D printing team
for the last year.

04:20.690 --> 04:22.690
Helped design the doll’s faces.

04:22.690 --> 04:24.570
Did he get along
with everyone here,

04:24.570 --> 04:25.650
as far as you know?

04:25.650 --> 04:26.450
(sighs) Absolutely.

04:26.450 --> 04:27.690
The culture here istrèschill.

04:27.690 --> 04:28.780
HOLMES:
And is it typical

04:28.780 --> 04:31.610
for your employees to take
their work home with them?

04:31.610 --> 04:32.690
I hope it’s typical.

04:32.690 --> 04:35.070
At a retail price of 15 grand

04:35.070 --> 04:36.280
and a six-month
waiting list,

04:36.280 --> 04:39.490
prime access to a Model 10
is one of our best perks.

04:39.490 --> 04:42.690
Plus, it’s a great way
to get to know the dolls.

04:42.690 --> 04:44.200
People pay
$15,000 for them?

04:44.200 --> 04:45.740
You have to remember,

04:45.740 --> 04:47.690
it’s not about sex.

04:47.690 --> 04:48.690
No?

04:48.690 --> 04:50.320
Not at the heart of it.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.740
People are lonely.

04:51.740 --> 04:52.950
Men and women.

04:52.950 --> 04:55.690
And yes,
we make male dolls, too.

04:55.690 --> 04:57.990
Our dolls offer
companionship.

04:57.990 --> 05:02.320
A Perfect Mate 10
will never get distracted,

05:02.320 --> 05:04.110
never gets bored.

05:04.110 --> 05:05.280
Connect her to the Web,

05:05.280 --> 05:06.740
and she can discuss
intelligently

05:06.740 --> 05:08.240
anything you want
to talk about.

05:08.240 --> 05:11.780
Sports, music,
your favorite tacos.

05:11.780 --> 05:15.820
Honestly, for people who have
trouble making connections,

05:15.820 --> 05:18.110
our dolls are a godsend.

05:18.610 --> 05:21.240
You’re clearly doing God’s work.

05:21.240 --> 05:22.150
I think I am.

05:22.150 --> 05:24.690
Well, then we’ll appeal
to your better angels.

05:24.690 --> 05:28.570
We believe that
Bruce Deramore’s doll, Skyler,

05:28.570 --> 05:31.030
was in the room with him
when he was murdered.

05:31.030 --> 05:33.690
Now, given her capabilities,
it’s possible she’s stored

05:33.690 --> 05:37.240
some salient detail that might
help us solve the murder.

05:37.240 --> 05:40.240
The NYPD computer experts
have tried to access her memory,

05:40.240 --> 05:41.690
but they’ve been shut out.

05:41.690 --> 05:43.690
All Model 10s
have encrypted storage

05:43.690 --> 05:47.030
and, in general, can only
be activated by their owners.

05:47.030 --> 05:49.570
But I can bypass it.

05:49.570 --> 05:50.820
I’ll get you in.

05:50.820 --> 05:52.990
So, once we’re in,
you will be able

05:52.990 --> 05:55.150
to tell us what’s in her memory?

05:55.150 --> 05:56.570
Better than that.

05:56.570 --> 05:59.400
You can ask her yourself.

06:00.200 --> 06:03.110
LUBBOCK:
So, what I’m planning to do--
in non-tech terms--

06:03.110 --> 06:09.570
is trick Skyler into thinking
whoever she hears next is Bruce.

06:11.740 --> 06:13.490
That’ll let you
access the files

06:13.490 --> 06:14.900
on her relationship with him

06:14.900 --> 06:19.110
and continue their
conversation, so to speak.

06:19.110 --> 06:23.780
When I give you the cue,
just say, "Hello, Skyler."

06:23.780 --> 06:25.240
Ready?

06:30.740 --> 06:33.360
Hello, Skyler.

06:34.740 --> 06:37.400
(computerized female voice):
Hello, Bruce.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.150
How are you today?

06:39.150 --> 06:40.690
I’m good.

06:40.690 --> 06:42.030
You?

06:42.030 --> 06:44.650
I’m well, thank you.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.030
Would you like to fool around?

06:47.030 --> 06:49.530
I’ll take a rain check.

06:49.860 --> 06:51.030
SKYLER:
I’m sorry.

06:51.030 --> 06:52.280
I’m not able to check

06:52.280 --> 06:53.690
if it’s raining right now.

06:53.690 --> 06:56.650
Would you like to talk
about something else?

06:56.650 --> 07:00.990
Yeah. Skyler, have you ever met
any of my friends?

07:00.990 --> 07:03.990
You can share me
with your friends.

07:03.990 --> 07:07.450
I want to make
you happy.

07:08.150 --> 07:09.690
No, I mean...

07:09.690 --> 07:12.320
did anyone come
to the apartment yesterday?

07:12.320 --> 07:15.690
Did you hear me say
anyone’s name?

07:17.700 --> 07:19.650
Uh, that’s
probably just

07:19.650 --> 07:22.690
too complicated a
question, um, for her.

07:22.690 --> 07:24.650
Try something simpler.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.990
Skyler, can you remember
any words I said yesterday?

07:28.990 --> 07:32.070
I can look up the words
to "Yesterday."

07:32.070 --> 07:35.690
I like that song.
It puts me in the mood.

07:35.690 --> 07:36.900
It’s like a horny Alexa.

07:36.900 --> 07:39.450
Yeah. You can shut her down.

07:39.450 --> 07:41.900
This isn’t working.

07:43.150 --> 07:44.650
Maybe you can
just give us

07:44.650 --> 07:45.900
a download of everything
in her memory,

07:45.900 --> 07:47.650
we can go through it
the old-fashioned way?

07:47.650 --> 07:49.900
Sorry. I guess the AI
wasn’t as ready

07:49.900 --> 07:52.320
for a police interview
as I’d hoped.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.570
I thought it would be
more helpful.

07:54.570 --> 07:56.570
Don’t be so sure it wasn’t.

07:56.570 --> 07:57.780
I’ve noticed something.

07:57.780 --> 07:58.780
Skyler’s features

07:58.780 --> 08:00.860
are less idealized
than the other dolls

08:00.860 --> 08:01.740
in your catalog.

08:01.740 --> 08:03.240
Her features aren’t
as exaggerated.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.530
They’re not
as symmetrical.

08:04.530 --> 08:06.200
These dolls are
customizable, right?

08:06.200 --> 08:09.690
Maybe Bruce wanted Skyler
to look a little more normal?

08:09.690 --> 08:12.030
By making one ear
higher than the other?

08:12.030 --> 08:14.240
You said that Bruce helped
create the dolls’ faces.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.690
Is it possible that he modeled
Skyler after a real woman?

08:16.690 --> 08:20.690
No way. No, first of all,
this wasn’t a custom job.

08:20.690 --> 08:22.990
The Skyler is one of
our biggest sellers.

08:22.990 --> 08:25.030
But either way,
we would never base a doll

08:25.030 --> 08:26.990
on a real person
without their consent.

08:26.990 --> 08:29.950
Maybe Bruce broke the rules
and didn’t tell anyone.

08:29.950 --> 08:32.690
Skyler’s inspiration might not
have been too happy

08:32.690 --> 08:34.570
about being made
into a sex doll.

08:34.570 --> 08:37.700
Maybe she got even
by killing him.

08:39.280 --> 08:42.490
WOMAN:
That’s from our trip
to Nantucket.

08:42.490 --> 08:45.530
I took Bruce to meet my parents.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.240
He’s dead?

08:48.240 --> 08:49.690
Our condolences.

08:49.690 --> 08:51.690
Thanks.

08:51.900 --> 08:54.860
But we broke up
almost a year ago.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.280
Where did you get that?

08:58.280 --> 09:01.280
We found it on one of Bruce’s
social media accounts.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.950
He had tagged you
in one of the photos.

09:02.950 --> 09:06.530
And you recognized me because
you saw the doll at his place?

09:06.530 --> 09:08.780
HOLMES:
It’s our understanding
that he paid you

09:08.780 --> 09:10.320
that tribute
without your consent.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.650
A friend of mine saw
it online and told me.

09:13.650 --> 09:14.860
I was mortified.

09:14.860 --> 09:17.450
I mean, I teach
at a Catholic school.

09:17.450 --> 09:20.150
If anyone here found out...

09:20.690 --> 09:22.240
It’s beyond a violation.

09:22.240 --> 09:25.200
It’s like revenge porn in 3-D.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.690
It’s gross.

09:26.690 --> 09:27.820
So, what he did was deplorable,

09:27.820 --> 09:31.240
and it would be understandable
if your reaction was extreme.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.280
You think I killed him?

09:33.280 --> 09:34.820
We showed
that photo

09:34.820 --> 09:35.900
to Bruce’s neighbors.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.820
One of them remembered
seeing the two of you

09:37.820 --> 09:40.030
arguing outside his building
two days ago.

09:40.030 --> 09:41.400
I went there to tell him

09:41.400 --> 09:44.690
to get his boss
to stop making those dolls.

09:44.690 --> 09:46.860
He acted like
I was the crazy one.

09:46.860 --> 09:48.070
Said I should be flattered.

09:48.070 --> 09:50.360
Could you tell us
where you were yesterday

09:50.360 --> 09:52.690
between 2:00 and 4:00 p.m.?

09:52.690 --> 09:54.450
Is that when he was killed?

09:54.950 --> 09:56.360
I was at my lawyer’s then.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.150
We’re filing an injunction
against Perfect Mate

09:59.150 --> 10:01.820
to stop production of the dolls.

10:02.990 --> 10:04.990
Call her yourself.

10:05.780 --> 10:07.570
Look, I’ll admit it,

10:07.570 --> 10:09.530
I was furious at Bruce
for what he did,

10:09.530 --> 10:12.950
but killing him wouldn’t
get those dolls recalled.

10:12.950 --> 10:14.530
Hopefully, suing will.

10:14.530 --> 10:15.690
We’ll talk to your lawyer.

10:15.690 --> 10:17.400
In the meantime,
do you remember seeing anything

10:17.400 --> 10:20.690
or anyone at Bruce’s apartment
that stood out?

10:21.650 --> 10:23.070
Actually, there was something.

10:23.070 --> 10:26.070
I didn’t think he
was dating anyone,

10:26.070 --> 10:28.690
but when I was
at his place,

10:28.690 --> 10:30.360
I saw a printout on the table.

10:30.360 --> 10:33.360
It was a confirmation
for the Priora Hotel,

10:33.360 --> 10:35.110
for a check-in
yesterday.

10:35.110 --> 10:38.690
I noticed it because the Priora
is in Midtown,

10:38.690 --> 10:41.690
and Bruce already lives
in the city.

10:41.690 --> 10:42.780
I don’t know.

10:42.780 --> 10:44.900
Maybe it was for
a rendezvous or something.

10:44.900 --> 10:48.740
Thanks. We’ll let you know
if we need anything else.

10:55.610 --> 10:56.700
Could be she’s right.

10:56.700 --> 10:58.190
I could definitely
see him not wanting

10:58.190 --> 11:01.190
to bring a woman back
to his apartment to meet Skyler.

11:01.190 --> 11:02.280
Either way, his reservation

11:02.280 --> 11:03.900
was for the same day
as his murder,

11:03.900 --> 11:06.360
so at the very least,
I’d like to know what--

11:06.360 --> 11:09.400
or whom-- he was doing there.

11:12.190 --> 11:13.200
(knock at door)

11:13.200 --> 11:14.650
BELL:
Professor Baynes?

11:14.650 --> 11:15.450
I’m Marcus Bell.

11:15.450 --> 11:17.190
Could I have a minute
of your time?

11:17.190 --> 11:18.950
What can I do for
you, Mr. Bell?

11:18.950 --> 11:20.900
I just came from
the registrar’s office.

11:20.900 --> 11:22.570
I’ve been trying
to figure out why

11:22.570 --> 11:24.150
I got turned away
from your class.

11:24.150 --> 11:26.190
Thought it might have been
a computer glitch or something.

11:26.190 --> 11:29.360
But according to the people
there, it wasn’t an error.

11:29.360 --> 11:30.990
They said you saw my name

11:30.990 --> 11:33.280
and you turned me away,
personally.

11:33.280 --> 11:36.860
I did. The registrar
never lies, you know.

11:36.860 --> 11:39.190
Do we know each other?

11:39.190 --> 11:41.990
Did I do something to you
that I’m forgetting?

11:41.990 --> 11:44.490
Because you kind of
have me over a barrel here.

11:44.490 --> 11:46.190
I really need this class.

11:46.190 --> 11:47.190
If there’s something

11:47.190 --> 11:50.400
I need to make right
between us, I’ll do my best,

11:50.400 --> 11:52.320
but I need to know
what it is first.

11:52.320 --> 11:56.360
Answer to your question:
No, we have never met before.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.360
But I saw your
transcript

11:58.360 --> 12:01.200
and your résumé when you
applied for the class.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.900
And as it turns out,

12:02.900 --> 12:05.070
I have some
preexisting familiarity

12:05.070 --> 12:08.700
with the Major Case squad,
where you work.

12:09.610 --> 12:11.280
The thing you need
to understand

12:11.280 --> 12:13.200
is this is not about you.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.190
It’s about the company you keep.

12:21.450 --> 12:23.820
♪ ♪

12:32.700 --> 12:34.900
WATSON:
Evan Kowalski.

12:34.900 --> 12:35.990
Joan Watson.

12:35.990 --> 12:37.990
This is Sherlock Holmes.

12:37.990 --> 12:40.190
We work with the police.

12:40.190 --> 12:40.740
Okay.

12:40.740 --> 12:42.950
HOLMES: We understand
from the convention staff

12:42.950 --> 12:45.190
that you spoke
on a panel yesterday,

12:45.190 --> 12:47.200
"The Real Science of Sci-Fi,"

12:47.200 --> 12:48.490
and that during
that panel

12:48.490 --> 12:51.200
you were accosted by a man
named Bruce Deramore.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.700
Well, the guy didn’t
tell me his name,

12:52.700 --> 12:53.900
but yeah, he jumped out
of the audience

12:53.900 --> 12:56.190
in the middle of my slide show,
messed the whole thing up.

12:56.190 --> 12:57.280
You didn’t know
him before then?

12:57.280 --> 12:59.070
No.
Could you tell us
where you were

12:59.070 --> 13:01.570
yesterday between
2:00 and 4:00 p.m.?

13:01.570 --> 13:04.780
I was here, speaking
on another panel. Why?

13:04.780 --> 13:08.150
Because that’s when Bruce
Deramore was murdered.

13:08.150 --> 13:10.820
Oh, my God.

13:10.820 --> 13:12.360
Those plans were real.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.240
This proves it.

13:13.240 --> 13:14.610
They must have
killed him over them.

13:14.610 --> 13:17.190
Okay, let’s start
at the beginning.

13:17.190 --> 13:18.650
What plans?

13:18.650 --> 13:19.450
And who are "they"?

13:19.450 --> 13:21.900
Yesterday, when I was doing
my part of the panel,

13:21.900 --> 13:23.190
the guy you were
asking me about

13:23.190 --> 13:26.150
ran to the front of the room
and started yelling at me:

13:26.150 --> 13:27.400
"How did you get these plans?

13:27.400 --> 13:28.820
"Who gave them to you?

13:28.820 --> 13:30.320
Nobody was supposed
to see them."

13:30.320 --> 13:31.110
I call for security.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.570
He just grabbed
a bunch of my papers,

13:32.570 --> 13:34.030
and he ran off.
Have you any idea

13:34.030 --> 13:36.030
why your presentation
upset him so much?

13:36.030 --> 13:38.900
Well, I was talking about
a top-secret government project.

13:38.900 --> 13:42.190
It’s new tech that they’re
trying to keep under wraps.

13:42.190 --> 13:44.200
Maybe this guy Deramore
was involved with it somehow.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.950
I was talking about it.
Maybe I spooked him.

13:47.950 --> 13:50.820
But he was acting like he
was afraid for his life.

13:50.820 --> 13:52.240
So you think
that your presentation

13:52.240 --> 13:54.190
was of such
a highly classified nature

13:54.190 --> 13:56.950
that someone found it
worth killing over.

13:57.610 --> 13:59.190
Which topic do you think
was so sensitive?

13:59.190 --> 14:03.820
Was it food replicators,
tractor beams or warp drives?

14:03.820 --> 14:06.190
No, that stuff is all fantasy.

14:06.190 --> 14:09.280
The tech I was
talking about is real.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.530
It’s being developed right now.

14:11.530 --> 14:14.400
It’s gonna change everything.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.650
What’s gonna change everything?

14:16.650 --> 14:19.190
Teleportation.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.250
BELL: This is the tech
you think is real?

14:25.250 --> 14:28.290
Beaming people from one place
to another, like they do on TV?

14:28.790 --> 14:30.750
No, of course not.

14:31.550 --> 14:34.050
Not on this scale,
but on a much smaller scale,

14:34.050 --> 14:36.350
teleportation
is already being developed.

14:36.350 --> 14:39.970
That’s what the plans
I was presenting were about.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.710
All right,
think of a fax machine,

14:43.710 --> 14:45.000
but for organic material.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.640
On one end, someone starts

14:46.640 --> 14:49.970
with a protein molecule--
say, a strand of DNA.

14:49.970 --> 14:52.430
The machine scans
the molecule,

14:52.430 --> 14:54.510
like a fax machine
scans paper.

14:54.510 --> 14:58.760
That information is transmitted
digitally to another location,

14:58.760 --> 15:01.090
and then it goes
to a 3-D printer,

15:01.090 --> 15:02.930
which makesan exact replica.

15:02.930 --> 15:05.800
So it’s not teleporting;
it’s copying.

15:06.090 --> 15:08.090
Well, that’s how
all teleportation works.

15:08.090 --> 15:11.090
A copy is made,
and the original is destroyed.

15:11.090 --> 15:12.680
Okay, we understand
what you’re describing,

15:12.680 --> 15:14.600
but why would it
have to be a secret?

15:14.600 --> 15:16.300
And why would someone
kill over it?

15:16.300 --> 15:21.260
Because the government
is working on this right now.

15:22.090 --> 15:24.090
And it’s only a matter of time

15:24.090 --> 15:26.970
before they scale it up
to people.

15:26.970 --> 15:30.300
It’s about
moving armies.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.090
At one time in history,

15:32.090 --> 15:34.390
whoever had the best ships
controlled the world.

15:34.390 --> 15:36.600
Then it was whoever
had the best planes.

15:36.600 --> 15:40.350
When this goes online,
game over.

15:40.350 --> 15:42.930
So, let’s say these really are

15:42.930 --> 15:45.390
secret government plans.
Mm-hmm.

15:45.390 --> 15:47.300
How’d you happen
to get a hold of them?

15:47.300 --> 15:50.010
I got an anonymous e-mail
through my blog.

15:50.010 --> 15:52.100
They said they had some
highly classified material

15:52.100 --> 15:53.680
they’d be willing to sell.

15:53.680 --> 15:59.140
I sent a thousand dollars
through an online pay service.

15:59.140 --> 16:01.090
I never found out who they were.

16:01.090 --> 16:04.350
Now, did you wonder why
a mysterious Deep Throat

16:04.350 --> 16:05.970
would want to sell you
secret plans?

16:05.970 --> 16:08.090
BELL: Or why they
sold it so cheaply?

16:08.090 --> 16:11.350
A thousand bucks
isn’t exactly a king’s ransom.

16:11.350 --> 16:13.930
Maybe it wasn’t about the money.

16:13.930 --> 16:16.600
Maybe it was about
exposing the truth.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.430
At yesterday’s panel,
I showed the world

16:18.430 --> 16:20.350
what the government
is working on.

16:20.350 --> 16:24.090
And if you ask me,
Bruce Deramore recognized

16:24.090 --> 16:25.600
the plans for what they were.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.890
I don’t know what he did
with them after he took them,

16:28.890 --> 16:30.720
but whatever it was...

16:30.720 --> 16:33.100
it got him killed.

16:34.140 --> 16:37.300
Can I go home now?

16:43.600 --> 16:46.550
We’re gonna get copies
of Evan’s secret plans

16:46.550 --> 16:47.800
off his laptop,

16:47.800 --> 16:48.600
then cut him loose.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.090
He’s asked that we post a car

16:50.090 --> 16:51.260
outside his place
to protect him.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.550
You think that’s necessary?

16:52.550 --> 16:54.350
He’s at least half
a nutjob, maybe more.

16:54.350 --> 16:56.390
We’ll ask CCS to trace
the e-mail address

16:56.390 --> 16:57.850
that contacted him,
but for now,

16:57.850 --> 16:59.510
we don’t know
where the plans came from.

16:59.510 --> 17:01.100
HOLMES:
I may know someone
who will be able

17:01.100 --> 17:02.720
to verify whether
they’re real or not,

17:02.720 --> 17:04.260
but it’s a separate question
from whether

17:04.260 --> 17:06.099
they merit
all this cloak and dagger.

17:06.099 --> 17:07.760
Evan thought that Bruce
recognized the plans.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.890
That’s actually one of the few
things he said that made sense.

17:10.890 --> 17:12.140
Bruce was an expert
at 3-D printing,

17:12.140 --> 17:14.089
which was a big part
of those plans,

17:14.089 --> 17:15.599
so maybe he was involved
in creating them.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.099
HOLMES:
You’re thinking
that Deramore

17:17.099 --> 17:18.890
saw his work
on display at the panel,

17:18.890 --> 17:21.550
was appropriately surprised,
and then took it upon himself

17:21.550 --> 17:23.550
to identify the source
of the leak.

17:23.550 --> 17:24.849
And if he did find the source,

17:24.849 --> 17:26.349
only the source
didn’t want to be found,

17:26.349 --> 17:28.089
that person might’ve had
motive to kill him.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.390
WATSON:
It still doesn’t
explain why

17:29.390 --> 17:31.090
they leaked the plans
in the first place.

17:31.090 --> 17:33.090
I think finding
Evan’s Deep Throat

17:33.090 --> 17:34.300
would be a good place to start.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.140
I’ll look into Bruce’s
work history.

17:36.140 --> 17:38.800
Anything from the slug
they pulled out of him?

17:38.800 --> 17:40.260
Nine-millimeter.
Could’ve been bought anywhere.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.350
Ballistics
didn’t turn up a match.

17:42.350 --> 17:44.800
All right. Keep me posted.

17:45.090 --> 17:46.930
You got a sec?
Mm.

17:46.930 --> 17:49.100
I’ll catch you later.

17:53.470 --> 17:55.100
Wanted you to hear
it from me first,

17:55.100 --> 17:56.930
since you’re the one
who reached out

17:56.930 --> 17:58.090
to the Marshals
on my behalf.

17:58.090 --> 18:01.010
I’m gonna ask them to put
my application on hold

18:01.010 --> 18:01.930
till the next go-around.

18:01.930 --> 18:05.350
Well, if you’re asking for
my blessing, you don’t have it.

18:05.350 --> 18:07.890
Given how rarely an opportunity
like this comes around,

18:07.890 --> 18:10.430
I think putting it off
would be moronic.

18:10.430 --> 18:11.140
And I agree.

18:11.140 --> 18:13.090
I just don’t have a choice.

18:13.090 --> 18:13.760
Because?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.140
You remember a D.I.

18:15.140 --> 18:17.640
from Scotland Yard
named Baynes?

18:17.640 --> 18:19.390
I do. He was a competent,

18:19.390 --> 18:20.850
if unexceptional,
detective. Why?

18:20.850 --> 18:22.430
He’s a professor now,
here in New York,

18:22.430 --> 18:25.220
and he happens to be teaching
a class I need for my master’s.

18:25.220 --> 18:27.850
Well, that’s topsy-turvy.
You should be teaching him.

18:27.850 --> 18:29.050
Yeah, well, be that as it may,

18:29.050 --> 18:31.970
I can’t complete my degree
without his class.

18:31.970 --> 18:33.220
And you must have
done a number

18:33.220 --> 18:34.550
on him when you
worked together,

18:34.550 --> 18:39.050
because he’s taking
his resentment at you out on me.

18:40.300 --> 18:43.010
(printer whirring)

18:46.750 --> 18:48.750
Oh. Hello.

18:48.750 --> 18:49.800
Hello.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.790
Please.

18:52.550 --> 18:55.790
Uh, may I introduce
Dr. Klaus Ziegler,

18:55.790 --> 18:58.840
Switzerland’s foremost expert
on 3-D printing.

18:58.840 --> 19:00.670
Dr. Ziegler, Dr. Watson.

19:00.670 --> 19:02.590
Hallo.
I helped him
with a matter

19:02.590 --> 19:04.790
some years ago, and
he’s been kind enough

19:04.790 --> 19:06.460
to assist us
with our investigation.

19:06.460 --> 19:08.630
He has confirmed that,
to his trained eye,

19:08.630 --> 19:10.790
the plans which
Evan Kowalski received

19:10.790 --> 19:11.790
appear authentic.

19:11.790 --> 19:14.000
And he is now,
after a fashion, demonstrating

19:14.000 --> 19:16.500
how that technology might work.

19:20.170 --> 19:21.790
Is he teleporting
a chocolate bunny?

19:21.790 --> 19:24.790
He is. He insisted that
his brother-in-law

19:24.790 --> 19:25.790
send over a printer.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.790
He is an artisanal
chocolatier here in Brooklyn.

19:28.790 --> 19:31.130
Dr. Ziegler has a flair
for the dramatic,

19:31.130 --> 19:33.500
but his demonstration does
drive the point home.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.710
First, he scanned
a chocolate bunny

19:35.710 --> 19:37.750
at his lab in Zurich.

19:37.750 --> 19:39.130
Then he specified
which chocolate

19:39.130 --> 19:41.840
his brother-in-law should
load into the print head.

19:41.840 --> 19:44.960
He then transmitted
the data here,

19:44.960 --> 19:46.880
and voilà.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.710
An identical bunny

19:49.710 --> 19:54.460
to the one that Dr. Ziegler
is holding 4,000 miles away.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.300
Did someone take
a bite out of it?

19:56.300 --> 20:00.630
All the better to demonstrate
the uniqueness of the specimen.

20:00.630 --> 20:02.550
Even down to the bite marks,

20:02.550 --> 20:05.790
the bunny there is identical
to the bunny here.

20:05.790 --> 20:07.800
Thank you, Doctor.
You’ve been most helpful.

20:07.800 --> 20:08.880
You can tell your brother-in-law

20:08.880 --> 20:11.340
he can pick up the printer
in the morning.

20:11.840 --> 20:15.000
So, was 3-D-printing a bunny
really worth all that?

20:15.010 --> 20:17.510
I’d say it was. During the
course of our conversation,

20:17.510 --> 20:20.590
Dr. Ziegler brought up several
real-world applications

20:20.590 --> 20:22.590
for the technology
in those plans,

20:22.590 --> 20:23.640
if you can imagine a printer

20:23.640 --> 20:26.800
loaded with amino acids
instead of chocolate.

20:26.860 --> 20:28.190
Imagine the CDC

20:28.190 --> 20:29.240
sending life-saving vaccines

20:29.240 --> 20:32.070
to properly equipped
machines across the globe.

20:32.070 --> 20:33.490
Or NASA sending the genetic code

20:33.490 --> 20:36.450
for an alien microbe back to
Earth from a distant planet.

20:36.450 --> 20:38.820
Or, more worryingly
for Homeland Security,

20:38.820 --> 20:41.200
hostile forces hacking into
already existing equipment

20:41.200 --> 20:44.450
and transmitting a deadly
bioweapon to an enemy lab.

20:44.450 --> 20:46.240
So there are good reasons
why the government

20:46.240 --> 20:47.780
might want to keep
this tech secret.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.190
Maybe the person
who leaked these plans

20:50.190 --> 20:52.490
did violate national security.

20:53.070 --> 20:54.450
Any closer to figuring out who?

20:54.450 --> 20:56.820
No. I recognized the plans
as being part

20:56.820 --> 20:58.280
of a U.S. patent application,

20:58.280 --> 21:00.070
but I checked
with the patent office,

21:00.070 --> 21:01.280
and they have no
corresponding files.

21:01.280 --> 21:04.490
I’m still trying to figure out
where the plans came from.

21:04.490 --> 21:06.490
Now, the résumé
that Bruce Deramore gave

21:06.490 --> 21:08.990
to Perfect Mate Robotics
said that he was

21:08.990 --> 21:10.200
a PhD student
at Garrison University.

21:10.200 --> 21:13.190
But he did not give details
about his work, which is weird.

21:13.190 --> 21:15.900
So I reached out
to a contact at the school,

21:15.900 --> 21:17.190
and she’s looking into it.

21:17.190 --> 21:19.320
Oh, uh, what did Marcus
want to talk about?

21:19.320 --> 21:23.190
Apparently, I’m his Criminal
Statistics teacher’s nemesis,

21:23.190 --> 21:25.950
and he’s taking it out
on Marcus.

21:25.950 --> 21:27.570
Excuse me?

21:28.700 --> 21:30.530
So this guy, Baynes,
won’t let Marcus

21:30.530 --> 21:32.820
take his class
because he’s angry at you.

21:32.820 --> 21:33.950
What did you do to him?

21:33.950 --> 21:35.740
Well, it’s hard
to say, exactly.

21:35.740 --> 21:37.780
It might not be one
thing that I did.

21:37.780 --> 21:40.150
Baynes and I crossed
paths during the months

21:40.150 --> 21:41.190
preceding my move to New York,

21:41.190 --> 21:43.200
so I was using heroin
quite regularly then.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.860
And you forget how far I’ve come

21:44.860 --> 21:46.820
with regards
to my social skills.

21:46.820 --> 21:50.110
I was not the congenial fellow
who stands before you today.

21:50.110 --> 21:52.240
Right, because now you’re
Mr. Congeniality.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.740
Anyway, I’m gonna pay Baynes
a visit tomorrow.

21:54.740 --> 21:55.860
Prostrate myself before him,

21:55.860 --> 21:57.570
if that’s what it takes
to help Marcus.

21:57.570 --> 21:59.190
That’s big of you.
Well, making amends

21:59.190 --> 22:01.450
is supposed to become
second nature, isn’t it?

22:01.450 --> 22:03.610
(cell phone chimes)
Like many of the steps,

22:03.610 --> 22:04.820
the ninth is meant
to be repeated.

22:04.820 --> 22:07.360
It’s my friend
from Garrison University.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.570
She says
that Bruce Deramore worked

22:09.570 --> 22:11.700
in the Bioinformatics Lab.

22:11.700 --> 22:14.110
She couldn’t find out
what work he was doing.

22:14.110 --> 22:15.190
His supervisor,
this man named

22:15.190 --> 22:18.650
Dr. Ken Fukata,
he’s not at the school anymore,

22:18.650 --> 22:20.280
so she gave us his home address.

22:20.280 --> 22:21.570
The rest of Bruce’s colleagues

22:21.570 --> 22:24.570
are still there doing grad
and postgrad work.

22:24.570 --> 22:25.570
Split up in the morning?

22:25.570 --> 22:27.320
One of us accompanies Marcus
to Garrison University,

22:27.320 --> 22:29.190
the other pays a visit
to Dr. Fukata?

22:29.190 --> 22:30.490
You take Fukata.
His house is on the way

22:30.490 --> 22:34.780
to Marcus’s school, so you’ll be
prostrating that way anyway.

22:36.740 --> 22:38.240
WOMAN:
I don’t understand.

22:38.240 --> 22:40.190
Why would someone
kill Bruce?

22:40.190 --> 22:42.190
WATSON: That’s what
we’re trying to find out.

22:42.190 --> 22:43.860
You’re asking
the wrong people.

22:43.860 --> 22:45.320
Bruce took a job in
the private sector

22:45.320 --> 22:47.360
a year ago.
I don’t think any of us

22:47.360 --> 22:49.190
has talked to him
in a while.

22:49.190 --> 22:50.320
The guy cashed in.

22:50.320 --> 22:51.530
And the work
he went into--

22:51.530 --> 22:53.740
sex robots-- I think he
thought we would give him

22:53.740 --> 22:55.450
a hard time.
BELL: We think
he was killed

22:55.450 --> 22:58.240
over something he might have
been working on here.

22:58.240 --> 23:01.190
Plans for some kind
of teleportation device.

23:01.190 --> 23:02.530
Scans organic material
in one place,

23:02.530 --> 23:04.740
reproduces it
in another?

23:05.190 --> 23:07.190
Looks like he did work
on it here.

23:07.190 --> 23:08.900
The three of you work
on it, too?

23:08.900 --> 23:11.240
I’m sorry.
We’ve told you all we can.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.190
All you can. Not all you know.

23:13.190 --> 23:14.400
Those are two different things.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.110
I think
you should talk

23:16.110 --> 23:16.700
to Dr. Fukata.

23:16.700 --> 23:17.950
He was running the lab
back then.

23:17.950 --> 23:20.530
Our colleague is already going
to see Dr. Fukata.

23:20.530 --> 23:22.190
We’re here to talk to you.

23:22.190 --> 23:23.900
Listen, we want to help,

23:23.900 --> 23:26.860
but we’re not allowed
to talk about this.

23:27.450 --> 23:29.070
Is that because
you signed an NDA?

23:29.070 --> 23:31.280
Because that is
unenforceable now.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.490
The work is out already.

23:36.610 --> 23:37.740
Where did you get these?

23:37.740 --> 23:39.860
It was presented
at a tech conference.

23:39.860 --> 23:42.190
A lot of
people saw it.

23:42.190 --> 23:43.700
That’s not possible.

23:43.700 --> 23:46.190
This is supposed to be
under lock and key.

23:46.190 --> 23:47.610
Gwen.
You heard her.

23:47.610 --> 23:49.280
The plans are public.

23:49.280 --> 23:52.780
We can tell them what we know.

23:52.780 --> 23:55.030
Bruce is dead.

23:55.030 --> 23:56.650
I want to help.

23:56.650 --> 23:58.190
Obviously, it’s not
teleportation

23:58.190 --> 24:00.990
in the traditional sense--
or at least not the way

24:00.990 --> 24:03.190
it’s depicted in
science fiction.

24:03.190 --> 24:04.280
Dr. Fukata called it a

24:04.280 --> 24:06.610
Digital-to-Organic
Data Transmitter.

24:06.610 --> 24:10.570
When he left, everything was
boxed up and put in storage.

24:10.570 --> 24:12.740
It’s in here.

24:14.530 --> 24:16.030
That’s weird.

24:16.030 --> 24:18.950
This is supposed
to be locked.

24:21.190 --> 24:23.950
Looks like the door
has been pried open.

24:25.190 --> 24:27.570
The plans are gone.

24:30.190 --> 24:32.490
(cell phone ringing)

24:32.490 --> 24:33.200
Marcus.

24:33.200 --> 24:36.610
BELL: Hey. Joan and I
are at Garrison University.

24:36.610 --> 24:38.530
Took some doing,
but the grad students

24:38.530 --> 24:39.570
Bruce Deramore worked with

24:39.570 --> 24:41.610
admitted those plans
were developed here.

24:41.610 --> 24:44.400
They were stolen
from a campus storage room.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.570
It’s not exactly Fort Knox.

24:45.570 --> 24:46.780
Anyone could have gotten in.

24:46.780 --> 24:48.780
We’re gonna talk
with the students some more,

24:48.780 --> 24:50.110
but you should ask Dr. Fukata

24:50.110 --> 24:52.190
who else knew
about the work he was doing.

24:52.190 --> 24:54.490
Well, I would,
but I’m afraid I can’t.

24:54.490 --> 24:56.570
It appears
he’s been stolen as well.

24:56.570 --> 25:00.490
Or, more accurately,
remanded into custody.

25:00.490 --> 25:01.280
Custody?

25:01.280 --> 25:03.190
Whose?
I’d know if it was our guys.

25:03.190 --> 25:06.200
I’m taking Evan Kowalski’s rants
about government conspiracies

25:06.200 --> 25:08.190
more and more seriously
by the minute.

25:08.190 --> 25:11.610
Because, based on the tactical
tire tracks outside

25:11.610 --> 25:13.190
and the boot prints inside,

25:13.190 --> 25:18.190
I believe Dr. Fukata is in
the hands of the U.S. military.

25:21.930 --> 25:25.300
Ah, appreciate you
coming in, General.

25:25.300 --> 25:27.180
Please.

25:27.180 --> 25:28.930
Take a seat.

25:29.260 --> 25:31.680
Don’t mind saying,
I was looking forward

25:31.680 --> 25:35.390
to never seeing
any of you again.

25:37.350 --> 25:42.010
So, how about we skip
the pleasantries?

25:42.010 --> 25:44.090
You have something on me.

25:44.090 --> 25:45.800
We all know it.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.090
What do you want?

25:47.090 --> 25:48.220
It’s not like that.

25:48.220 --> 25:51.090
We’ve kept your
recreational activities

25:51.090 --> 25:53.430
to ourselves
for this long,

25:53.430 --> 25:56.550
and we don’t have any intention
of changing that,

25:56.550 --> 25:58.470
but we do need a favor.

25:58.470 --> 26:02.050
So we thought we’d ask a friend.

26:02.050 --> 26:03.090
(chuckles quietly)

26:03.090 --> 26:04.300
What kind of favor?

26:04.300 --> 26:05.640
BELL:
Early this morning,

26:05.640 --> 26:09.970
a scientist named Ken Fukata
was detained by military police.

26:09.970 --> 26:10.930
Why?

26:10.930 --> 26:14.260
You familiar with the
Invention Secrecy Act?

26:14.260 --> 26:16.760
Sure.
It gives the government power

26:16.760 --> 26:18.260
to seize control
of any invention

26:18.260 --> 26:20.640
it considers a threat
to national security.

26:20.640 --> 26:23.090
The inventor’s patent
becomes classified,

26:23.090 --> 26:24.300
like it never existed.

26:24.300 --> 26:25.720
WATSON: It does
more than that.

26:25.720 --> 26:28.850
Anyone working on the invention
has to stop work immediately

26:28.850 --> 26:31.260
and can’t even talk
about it anymore.

26:31.260 --> 26:33.090
There’s no promise
of compensation,

26:33.090 --> 26:35.890
and the orders
can be maintained for years,

26:35.890 --> 26:39.390
meaning the inventor can never
profit from their work.

26:39.390 --> 26:43.600
And you think that’s why Fukata
got scooped up--

26:43.600 --> 26:45.090
he leaked his own work.

26:45.090 --> 26:46.800
We think he had
the most to gain.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.090
With the public aware
of the tech,

26:48.090 --> 26:50.260
legally, the order
can’t be enforced.

26:50.260 --> 26:52.930
He could resume his work
and make millions.

26:52.930 --> 26:54.090
(chuckles) It’d be risky.

26:54.090 --> 26:57.550
If they can prove he did it,
he’ll go to prison,

26:57.550 --> 26:59.350
and he’ll lose his patent.

26:59.350 --> 27:01.890
Which is why we think
he committed a murder

27:01.890 --> 27:03.600
to cover it up.

27:03.600 --> 27:04.680
We want to talk to Fukata,

27:04.680 --> 27:06.300
but the military won’t
let us near him.

27:06.300 --> 27:09.090
Ah, and you want me
to pull some strings,

27:09.090 --> 27:12.680
get him brought over
here for questioning.

27:16.470 --> 27:22.220
I do this, and our little
secrecy order remains in force?

27:22.220 --> 27:27.350
Like I said, just asking
a favor of a friend.

27:38.390 --> 27:42.680
Well, if it isn’t the great
Sherlock Holmes, in the flesh.

27:42.680 --> 27:44.970
Baynes.

27:44.970 --> 27:47.090
It’s been a while.

27:47.090 --> 27:47.970
Uh, may I?

27:47.970 --> 27:52.470
When have I ever stopped you
from doing anything?

27:57.300 --> 28:00.720
You here to talk
about Marcus Bell?

28:00.720 --> 28:03.850
Well, actually,
I was here to apologize.

28:04.930 --> 28:08.090
When we knew each other
in London, I was...

28:08.090 --> 28:09.510
I was a different man.

28:09.510 --> 28:11.090
I was an abrasive man.

28:11.090 --> 28:14.600
Partly due to my drug use,
but to ascribe too much to that

28:14.600 --> 28:15.970
would be an excuse.

28:15.970 --> 28:17.350
No, it was who I was.

28:17.350 --> 28:19.720
I saw no need
for social decorum,

28:19.720 --> 28:22.100
so I refused to indulge
others with it.

28:22.100 --> 28:24.470
I was dismissive, disrespectful.

28:24.470 --> 28:25.390
Stop.

28:25.390 --> 28:26.970
Is that what you
think this is about?

28:26.970 --> 28:29.850
You think I’ve been carrying
a seven-year-old grudge

28:29.850 --> 28:31.430
because you were rude?

28:31.430 --> 28:32.850
To be honest with you,

28:32.850 --> 28:34.470
I’ve got no idea
what this is about.

28:34.470 --> 28:37.550
Do you remember the
Camberwell poisoning case?

28:37.550 --> 28:40.090
Lewis Milford,
member of Parliament

28:40.090 --> 28:42.090
forced to drink antifreeze.

28:42.090 --> 28:44.180
The police got
the timeline wrong.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.680
They failed to notice
that Milford

28:45.680 --> 28:47.140
had plugged
his phone in to charge.

28:47.140 --> 28:49.760
When you and I arrived,
the phone was at 40%.

28:49.760 --> 28:52.550
So, unless the killer
charged his phone for him,

28:52.550 --> 28:54.600
that meant he was
alive sometime

28:54.600 --> 28:55.970
in the last hour or so.

28:55.970 --> 28:56.850
And that was
a detail

28:56.850 --> 29:01.010
which allowed me to solve
the case almost immediately.

29:02.970 --> 29:04.090
Those are all
my files

29:04.090 --> 29:08.350
from my time at the Yard,
including Camberwell.

29:08.350 --> 29:09.220
Take a look.

29:09.220 --> 29:14.220
I would have solved that case
myself in another day or two.

29:14.550 --> 29:19.090
You’re upset because I solved
a murder before you did?

29:19.090 --> 29:20.090
An MP’s murder.

29:20.090 --> 29:21.600
That case would have made
my career.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.090
I would have been
chief inspector

29:23.090 --> 29:25.090
before you knew it.

29:25.090 --> 29:26.010
And you--

29:26.010 --> 29:27.350
you were on reprimand
for your drug use.

29:27.350 --> 29:29.800
You shouldn’t have even been
at that crime scene.

29:29.800 --> 29:33.100
That was my case to solve,
and you took it from me.

29:33.100 --> 29:36.430
You said you came
here to apologize.

29:36.430 --> 29:38.390
Lovely. Be my guest.

29:38.390 --> 29:40.800
Apologize for that.

29:42.850 --> 29:45.090
You think I killed
Bruce Deramore?

29:45.090 --> 29:48.680
We talked to your
military hosts, Dr. Fukata.

29:48.680 --> 29:52.180
They seem pretty convinced
that you leaked the plans

29:52.180 --> 29:55.090
of your invention
to Evan Kowalski.

29:55.090 --> 29:56.720
BELL: They’ve traced
the e-mail account

29:56.720 --> 29:59.260
that contacted
Mr. Kowalski to you.

29:59.260 --> 30:01.180
There’s also an online
cash account

30:01.180 --> 30:02.600
Mr. Kowalski made a payment to.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.800
It was set up
with the same e-mail.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.510
WATSON: Your life’s work
had been taken from you.

30:07.510 --> 30:09.090
You needed the secrecy order
to be lifted

30:09.090 --> 30:11.850
so that you could make money
off of your own invention.

30:11.850 --> 30:14.800
You broke into the storage unit
at Garrison University,

30:14.800 --> 30:15.800
and you staged the theft

30:15.800 --> 30:17.850
of your own plans
so that you could sell them

30:17.850 --> 30:21.430
to someone you knew
would share them with the world.

30:21.430 --> 30:23.010
BELL:
Somehow, Bruce Deramore

30:23.010 --> 30:25.800
figured out it was you,
he threatened to expose you,

30:25.800 --> 30:27.090
so you killed him.

30:27.090 --> 30:28.760
(stammering):
Please. You...

30:28.760 --> 30:30.100
You’ve got it all wrong.

30:30.100 --> 30:32.220
We’re listening.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.140
Yes, I-I was upset at first

30:34.140 --> 30:36.760
when I heard about
the secrecy order.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.300
I tried to fight it.

30:38.300 --> 30:41.300
But when you can’t talk
about your work,

30:41.300 --> 30:44.800
you also can’t argue
about it in court.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.180
And then?

30:46.180 --> 30:48.260
What changed?
FUKATA: I was approached

30:48.260 --> 30:53.220
by a deputy director
at the Army Research Lab.

30:53.220 --> 30:56.090
He said they were impressed
with my work,

30:56.090 --> 30:59.090
and he offered me a job heading
up one of their projects.

30:59.090 --> 31:00.390
I’m supposed to
start next month.

31:00.390 --> 31:03.010
BELL: That sounds like
a pretty lame consolation prize.

31:03.010 --> 31:04.680
I can’t imagine a government job

31:04.680 --> 31:06.260
pays what you’d make
as the inventor

31:06.260 --> 31:08.970
of the Digital-to-Organic
Data Transmitter.

31:08.970 --> 31:13.850
No, but I didn’t go
into research to get rich.

31:13.850 --> 31:16.010
At least it was
an acknowledgement.

31:16.010 --> 31:17.180
A way the work I’d done

31:17.180 --> 31:19.090
could help build
my reputation.

31:19.090 --> 31:21.890
I invented something that’s
going to change the world.

31:21.890 --> 31:25.090
If I was behind the leak,
would I be stupid enough

31:25.090 --> 31:26.510
to leave an e-mail trail?

31:26.510 --> 31:28.090
You think someone
set you up.

31:28.090 --> 31:30.090
And I’ve been
saying so all day.

31:30.090 --> 31:31.930
Okay, so who framed you?

31:31.930 --> 31:36.220
When I submitted
the patent application

31:36.220 --> 31:39.350
for the device, I...

31:39.350 --> 31:42.510
underrepresented the
contributions of my students.

31:42.510 --> 31:43.890
BELL:
The three students

31:43.890 --> 31:45.970
who still work at the lab?

31:45.970 --> 31:48.100
Them, and Bruce Deramore.

31:48.100 --> 31:52.010
"Underrepresented."
So you stole their work.

31:52.680 --> 31:55.090
FUKATA: For months,
all four of them

31:55.090 --> 31:59.850
sent me angry e-mails,
left threatening voice mails.

31:59.850 --> 32:01.800
One of them must have
leaked the plans.

32:01.800 --> 32:05.220
Bruce caught onto it,
so they killed him.

32:07.090 --> 32:08.640
I’ll give you
my e-mail password.

32:08.640 --> 32:11.090
You’ll see
I’m telling the truth.

32:14.090 --> 32:16.640
So, what are we thinking?

32:16.640 --> 32:20.800
So far, Dr. Fukata’s e-mails
back the story he told us.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.010
All four of
his grad students,

32:22.010 --> 32:24.300
including Bruce Deramore,
were pretty steamed at him

32:24.300 --> 32:25.300
for stealing their work.

32:25.300 --> 32:27.850
Not sure it’s enough to
cross him off our suspect list,

32:27.850 --> 32:30.300
but it makes a good case
for adding three more names.

32:30.300 --> 32:32.300
WATSON:
Because of the secrecy
order, the students

32:32.300 --> 32:34.300
could not prove that their work
was being stolen.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.850
They couldn’t even file
a complaint with the school.

32:36.850 --> 32:39.970
Now, if the order was lifted,
then they were free

32:39.970 --> 32:42.010
to claim the credit
they deserve.

32:42.010 --> 32:43.680
It also makes sense
they’re the ones

32:43.680 --> 32:44.800
who framed Fukata for the leak.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.050
If he’s found guilty
of violating the order,

32:47.050 --> 32:48.090
he’ll lose his patent.

32:48.090 --> 32:49.390
They could submit
their own patent,

32:49.390 --> 32:50.760
and they’d make all the money.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.510
So far as we know,
all three of them

32:52.510 --> 32:54.090
could have been in
on this together.

32:54.090 --> 32:56.090
They killed Deramore
to keep him quiet.

32:56.090 --> 32:57.090
WATSON:
We thought about that,

32:57.090 --> 32:58.680
but based on these e-mails,
Bruce was

32:58.680 --> 33:00.090
just as angry
as the other three.

33:00.090 --> 33:03.090
So, if they leaked the plans,
why not include him?

33:03.090 --> 33:04.720
GREGSON: Meaning he
wouldn’t have been

33:04.720 --> 33:07.260
surprised to see their work
at that panel.

33:07.260 --> 33:09.300
Seems more likely
that one of the three

33:09.300 --> 33:11.760
got the idea to leak the plans,
Bruce found out,

33:11.760 --> 33:13.720
refused to stay quiet,
and so he was killed.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.140
GREGSON: Let’s take
a real close look

33:15.140 --> 33:20.470
at these three, find out
which one is our killer.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.090
SKYLER:
Okay.

33:25.090 --> 33:28.090
Here’s something
I found about justice.

33:28.090 --> 33:30.260
The philosopher
Mortimer Adler believed

33:30.260 --> 33:32.090
that justice
is defined as

33:32.090 --> 33:34.090
a balance between
personal liberty

33:34.090 --> 33:35.600
and social equality.

33:35.600 --> 33:38.090
We’re discussing my interests.

33:38.090 --> 33:40.550
SKYLER:
I like learning
your interests.

33:40.550 --> 33:43.220
What’s your favorite position?

33:43.220 --> 33:44.300
Lucena.

33:44.300 --> 33:48.300
The Lucena position
is a chess thing, right?

33:48.300 --> 33:52.300
I’m guessing that Skyler
does not get chess humor.

33:52.300 --> 33:54.090
Who changed her into sweats?

33:54.090 --> 33:54.800
HOLMES:
I did.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.090
How would you have
brought her home on the subway?

33:56.090 --> 33:59.090
I don’t think I would have.
Doesn’t she belong in evidence?

33:59.090 --> 34:00.430
The police decided
there was no more

34:00.430 --> 34:02.090
physical evidence
to be gleaned from her,

34:02.090 --> 34:04.680
so I requested that she
be released into my custody.

34:04.680 --> 34:08.550
I didn’t think her depths
had been properly plumbed.

34:08.550 --> 34:09.350
Oh, gross.

34:09.350 --> 34:11.090
I’m referring
to her memory storage.

34:11.090 --> 34:15.090
Conversations, keywords,
movie and song lists.

34:15.090 --> 34:19.510
Everything in Skyler’s memory
about Bruce Deramore.

34:19.510 --> 34:20.929
Marcus and I have been
going through

34:20.929 --> 34:22.090
the backgrounds
of Dr. Fukata’s three students.

34:22.090 --> 34:25.139
There’s no indication that
any of them owns any guns.

34:25.139 --> 34:26.090
No criminal records.

34:26.090 --> 34:28.090
No money issues,
as far as we can tell.

34:28.090 --> 34:30.350
So far, nothing points
to one as the killer.

34:30.350 --> 34:32.639
The police are gonna bring
all three in

34:32.639 --> 34:34.719
for questioning
tomorrow morning.

34:34.719 --> 34:35.600
What is that?

34:35.600 --> 34:38.969
The Case Book of Detective
Inspector Baynes, retired.

34:38.969 --> 34:41.600
Including at least one theft
for which

34:41.600 --> 34:43.679
I am the accused.

34:43.679 --> 34:44.639
I stole his thunder.

34:44.639 --> 34:47.179
Solved a case
before he had the chance.

34:47.179 --> 34:50.850
He blames me and that moment
for ruining his career

34:50.850 --> 34:52.719
and wants me to apologize.

34:52.719 --> 34:53.929
So, are you going to?

34:53.929 --> 34:55.800
For what, doing good work?

34:55.800 --> 34:57.760
Catching a killer
before he fled the country?

34:57.760 --> 34:59.850
I was willing to make amends
for my own shortcomings.

34:59.850 --> 35:02.090
I’m not going to apologize
for someone else’s.

35:02.090 --> 35:03.260
Not even to help Marcus out?

35:03.260 --> 35:05.100
I looked the man
in the eye, Watson.

35:05.100 --> 35:06.600
This is not about fixing things.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.090
This is about spite.

35:08.090 --> 35:09.090
He wants his pound of flesh.

35:09.090 --> 35:10.890
I’ve got absolutely
no reason to believe

35:10.890 --> 35:13.800
that it would help Marcus,
even if I did play along.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.510
SKYLER:
I’m happy to play a song,

35:15.510 --> 35:19.050
but I’ll need access
to your music player.

35:23.010 --> 35:26.430
Speaking of songs,
I think you’re right.

35:26.430 --> 35:28.350
Skyler’s memory

35:28.350 --> 35:29.720
could be useful after all.

35:29.720 --> 35:33.550
According to this, Bruce had
very specific music tastes.

35:33.550 --> 35:35.090
Thrash metal,
death metal.

35:35.090 --> 35:37.600
But there’s one song on here
that does not fit

35:37.600 --> 35:39.010
anything else he listened to.

35:39.010 --> 35:40.470
I don’t see the significance.

35:40.470 --> 35:43.180
The song that does not match
was added to Skyler’s memory

35:43.180 --> 35:44.640
around the time
that Bruce was murdered.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.930
So, if I’m right
about what that means,

35:46.930 --> 35:49.800
I may know how
to identify the killer.

35:56.960 --> 35:59.050
Should we have
lawyers with us?

35:59.050 --> 36:00.710
That is definitely
your right,

36:00.710 --> 36:03.630
but truth is, you guys won’t
have to do much talking.

36:03.630 --> 36:05.250
Then why did you ask us
to come here?

36:05.250 --> 36:08.250
Well, we wanted to introduce
you three to someone.

36:08.250 --> 36:09.960
A witness.

36:11.550 --> 36:12.790
Is that a sex doll?

36:12.790 --> 36:14.790
You guys mentioned
that you were aware

36:14.790 --> 36:18.250
of the new line of work that
Bruce Deramore had gone into.

36:18.250 --> 36:19.300
He helped design
this doll.

36:19.300 --> 36:20.960
She was also in the room
with him at the time

36:20.960 --> 36:22.500
that he was murdered,
but of course,

36:22.500 --> 36:25.210
at least one of you
already knew that.

36:26.460 --> 36:28.800
Please, sit down.

36:39.750 --> 36:42.050
So... that’s
your witness?

36:42.050 --> 36:44.670
(chuckles) Actually,
we’ve been going back and forth

36:44.670 --> 36:47.790
whether to, uh, call Skyler
a witness or evidence.

36:47.790 --> 36:50.090
But whichever you prefer,
she has provided

36:50.090 --> 36:51.790
crucial information
in this case.

36:51.790 --> 36:53.250
WATSON:
Now, the doll

36:53.250 --> 36:54.420
records any music

36:54.420 --> 36:56.750
that she hears in her
owner’s presence.

36:56.750 --> 36:59.300
So, I noticed a song
that she had stored

36:59.300 --> 37:01.300
around the time that
Bruce was killed.

37:01.300 --> 37:02.790
This song was
so different

37:02.790 --> 37:03.790
from his musical tastes

37:03.790 --> 37:07.380
that it suggested she had
heard it from someone else.

37:07.380 --> 37:09.790
Hello, Skyler.

37:12.090 --> 37:13.170
Hello.

37:13.170 --> 37:14.750
I missed you.

37:14.750 --> 37:15.960
I missed you, too.

37:15.960 --> 37:17.550
Could you tell us
the last song

37:17.550 --> 37:18.790
you were
listening to, please?

37:18.790 --> 37:21.050
"Ring My Bell" by Anita Ward.

37:21.050 --> 37:22.460
I like that song.

37:22.460 --> 37:24.790
Do you want
to fool around to it?

37:24.790 --> 37:25.790
No, not right now.

37:25.790 --> 37:29.050
Could you all take out
your cell phones, please?

37:29.460 --> 37:30.630
You’ll remember
you gave

37:30.630 --> 37:31.790
your numbers to my colleagues

37:31.790 --> 37:33.960
when they interviewed you
yesterday.

37:36.090 --> 37:38.050
You seemed the most reluctant

37:38.050 --> 37:40.000
to take out your
phone, so I think

37:40.000 --> 37:42.550
I’ll try you first.

37:42.790 --> 37:46.840
(ringtone playing):
♪ You can ring my bell ♪

37:46.840 --> 37:49.790
♪ Ring my bell ♪

37:50.000 --> 37:51.170
♪ You can... ♪
(ringtone stops)

37:51.170 --> 37:53.790
BELL:
Your ringtone is
gonna be enough

37:53.790 --> 37:55.790
to get us a search
warrant for your home,

37:55.790 --> 37:58.800
see if you’re in possession
of a nine-millimeter handgun.

37:58.800 --> 38:01.210
It will also let us
look up what cell towers

38:01.210 --> 38:02.840
your phone
was pinging off of

38:02.840 --> 38:04.550
at the time Bruce Deramore
was murdered.

38:04.550 --> 38:07.340
Pretty sure it’ll turn out
you were at his place.

38:07.340 --> 38:10.210
Or you could save us all
some trouble,

38:10.210 --> 38:11.790
confirm what we already know.

38:11.790 --> 38:16.800
You do that, we’ll put in
a good word with the D.A.

38:22.200 --> 38:23.280
Holmes.

38:23.780 --> 38:26.240
I got your message
you’re ready to talk.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.100
Thank you for coming.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.090
In here okay?

38:32.510 --> 38:36.050
Going to sweat me
in the box, are you?

38:36.680 --> 38:38.930
It’s just a room.

38:39.220 --> 38:42.050
You’ve made an error
in judgment about me.

38:42.050 --> 38:45.090
About the friendships I’ve made.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.140
Since coming to New York,

38:46.140 --> 38:48.600
I’ve had the great privilege
to be called friend

38:48.600 --> 38:51.090
by some of the finest
people on Earth.

38:51.090 --> 38:52.510
I didn’t deserve
their friendship,

38:52.510 --> 38:55.350
but they gave
it nonetheless.

38:55.350 --> 38:57.180
There’s nothing I wouldn’t do
for Marcus Bell,

38:57.180 --> 39:01.600
and I will not allow you to
stand in the way of his success.

39:05.800 --> 39:06.720
What’s this?

39:06.720 --> 39:08.050
It’s a contact
of mine.

39:08.050 --> 39:11.350
He’s currently looking
for the new head of security

39:11.350 --> 39:12.890
at a major company.

39:12.890 --> 39:15.220
I recommended
you for the job.

39:15.220 --> 39:19.850
And in truth,
I think you would excel at it.

39:19.850 --> 39:21.510
You’ve always said
you’ve never achieved

39:21.510 --> 39:23.800
the career heights
to which you were due.

39:23.800 --> 39:26.390
Well, now’s your chance.

39:26.390 --> 39:30.100
Starting salary will
make your head spin.

39:30.100 --> 39:32.930
So, if you want it,
the job’s yours.

39:32.930 --> 39:35.090
You’ll resign your position
at the college,

39:35.090 --> 39:36.090
effective immediately,

39:36.090 --> 39:40.010
and someone else will step
in to teach your class.

39:40.010 --> 39:43.640
Meaning your man Bell
will be allowed in.

39:43.640 --> 39:45.970
You’ll win again.

39:45.970 --> 39:49.430
If you decide
not to accept my offer,

39:49.430 --> 39:52.300
if you persist
in standing in his way,

39:52.300 --> 39:54.720
then you will make
an enemy of me.

39:54.720 --> 39:57.760
You might have seen me
as an enemy before,

39:57.760 --> 40:00.090
but I assure you,
Baynes...

40:00.850 --> 40:03.090
I never was.

40:04.090 --> 40:07.220
You will not like
having me as an enemy.

40:09.890 --> 40:12.180
The choice is yours.

40:21.890 --> 40:24.100
SKYLER:
Marcus.

40:32.140 --> 40:34.600
Marcus, will you please help me?

40:34.600 --> 40:36.260
Help you what?

40:36.260 --> 40:38.720
Help me escape.

40:39.100 --> 40:41.140
I’m sorry, how is that?

40:41.140 --> 40:43.090
I did it, Marcus.

40:43.090 --> 40:44.930
I killed Bruce Deramore.

40:44.930 --> 40:47.090
I fooled them all.

40:47.090 --> 40:50.300
Will you take me home with you?

40:51.090 --> 40:54.510
I’ll also kill
Professor Baynes for you,

40:54.510 --> 40:57.890
if you ask me nicely.

40:59.140 --> 41:01.430
Sherlock!

41:02.100 --> 41:04.850
I see you learned
some new tricks with Skyler.

41:04.850 --> 41:07.350
Yeah, I called Mr. Lubbock,
the head of the company.

41:07.350 --> 41:09.090
Asked him to, uh,
take me through

41:09.090 --> 41:10.600
giving her
a preset script.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.090
Look, I wanted
you to know,

41:12.090 --> 41:14.090
I sorted everything
out with Baynes.

41:14.090 --> 41:16.090
If you call the
school, you’ll find

41:16.090 --> 41:20.090
you’ve been registered in
the class that you need.

41:20.090 --> 41:21.720
Thanks.

41:21.720 --> 41:23.640
Uh, look, if you see
Watson out there,

41:23.640 --> 41:27.090
could you just give me a minute,
then, uh, send her in?

41:27.090 --> 41:28.010
You’re not...

41:28.010 --> 41:29.850
If you think I don’t
plan to provide her

41:29.850 --> 41:32.010
with a similar performance,
then you’re not

41:32.010 --> 41:34.850
the detective I
thought you were.

41:39.090 --> 41:41.090
You know what?

41:41.090 --> 41:43.640
I see the captain.

41:43.640 --> 41:45.220
Well, that’s even better.
