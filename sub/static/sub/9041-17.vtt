WEBVTT

00:02.233 --> 00:04.100
- HEY, MA.
- HELLO, DEAR.

00:04.100 --> 00:06.133
- WHATCHA DOIN' THERE?

00:06.133 --> 00:07.367
- OH, THIS?

00:07.367 --> 00:10.300
THIS IS CALLED
"POLISHING SILVER."

00:12.800 --> 00:14.533
- YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

00:14.533 --> 00:16.467
IT'S JUST THAT WE DON'T
OFTEN SEE YOUR SILVER.

00:16.467 --> 00:19.100
- PLEASE, STOP HINTING,
DEBRA.

00:19.100 --> 00:20.667
THE SILVER'S
GOING TO ROBBIE.

00:20.667 --> 00:23.900
IT'S ALREADY IN THE WILL.
- OKAY.

00:23.900 --> 00:26.267
- WHAT'S THIS, FOR LEE
AND STAN'S ANNIVERSARY PARTY?

00:26.267 --> 00:27.833
- THEIR 45TH.

00:27.833 --> 00:30.833
THEY'RE OUR DEAREST FRIENDS,
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

00:30.833 --> 00:34.367
I NEVER THOUGHT
THEY'D LAST THIS LONG.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.667
- WHERE YOU GOIN',
ROBERT?

00:35.667 --> 00:37.200
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON IN THERE?

00:37.200 --> 00:38.500
- OH, ROBBIE'S
HELPING YOUR FATHER

00:38.500 --> 00:40.633
WRITE A FUNNY SPEECH
FOR LEE AND STAN.

00:40.633 --> 00:42.467
- GET BACK HERE!
WE'RE NOT DONE!

00:42.467 --> 00:44.900
- OH, WE'RE DONE, OLD MAN!

00:44.900 --> 00:47.133
- FINE, FINE!

00:47.133 --> 00:49.733
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP
ANYMORE!

00:49.733 --> 00:52.400
MARIE, I'M NOT DOING
THE STUPID SPEECH.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.633
- IT'S THE ONE THING
YOU HAVE TO DO FOR THE PARTY!

00:55.633 --> 00:58.833
- WELL, NOW THE ONE THING
I HAVE TO DO IS EAT SHRIMP.

00:58.833 --> 01:00.567
- YOU HAVE TO WRITE SOMETHING.

01:00.567 --> 01:02.667
THEY'RE OUR DEAREST FRIENDS.

01:02.667 --> 01:03.700
- TO HELL WITH THEM.

01:03.700 --> 01:06.100
- OH, YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLE!

01:06.100 --> 01:07.400
WOULD YOU TALK TO HIM?

01:07.400 --> 01:10.233
HE HAS TO WRITE SOMETHING.
OTHERWISE--

01:14.167 --> 01:15.933
RAYMOND...

01:15.933 --> 01:17.767
- MA, DON'T EVEN
THINK OF IT.

01:17.767 --> 01:18.967
- RAYMOND...

01:18.967 --> 01:21.233
- BACK! BACK! BACK!

01:22.700 --> 01:25.300
- UH-UH-UH-UH-UH-UH.
READ THE WILL.

01:29.900 --> 01:31.300
- YOU CAN DO IT, RAYMOND.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.533
YOU CAN DO
LEE AND STAN'S TRIBUTE!

01:33.533 --> 01:36.233
- [mimicking]
NO, I CAN'T!

01:36.233 --> 01:38.100
- THEY'LL BE SO THRILLED!

01:38.100 --> 01:40.133
- MA, PLEASE,
I HARDLY KNOW 'EM.

01:40.133 --> 01:42.967
- RAYMOND,
THEY'RE OUR DEAREST FRIENDS.

01:42.967 --> 01:44.633
- NO! NO! NO!

01:44.633 --> 01:47.100
- WE'RE PRACTICALLY RELATED.
YOU LIVED AT THEIR HOUSE!

01:47.100 --> 01:48.467
- WHAT?

01:48.467 --> 01:50.900
- WHEN YOUR FATHER AND I
WENT TO ATLANTIC CITY.

01:50.900 --> 01:51.967
- THAT WAS A WEEKEND.

01:51.967 --> 01:52.967
- IT WAS A LONG WEEKEND.

01:52.967 --> 01:54.500
- YOU SAID IT.

01:56.133 --> 01:58.500
- OH, RAYMOND,
YOU'LL BE WONDERFUL.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.500
- MA, MA, I SPEND ALL DAY
TRYING TO WRITE MY COLUMN.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.133
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO COME UP
WITH AN ANNIVERSARY SPEECH.

02:03.133 --> 02:04.500
- IT'S NOT A SPEECH.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.833
IT WAS A SPEECH
WHEN YOUR FATHER WAS DOING IT,

02:05.833 --> 02:07.200
'CAUSE THAT'S ALL
HE COULD HANDLE.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.267
BUT YOU...
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING!

02:10.267 --> 02:14.767
- NOT ANYTHING.
IN FACT, NOTHING.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.033
- MAYBE YOU COULD DO, LIKE,

02:16.033 --> 02:18.233
AN INTERPRETIVE DANCE
OR SOMETHING.

02:18.233 --> 02:21.400
- YOU COULD DO A THING
WHERE YOU SHUT IT!

02:21.400 --> 02:23.367
- HEY, LISTEN, RAY,
WHATEVER YOU DO,

02:23.367 --> 02:24.933
TRY TO MENTION
THAT MY NAME IS DEBRA.

02:24.933 --> 02:26.667
LEE KEEPS CALLING ME DONNA.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.933
- ARE YOU HELPING ME?

02:28.933 --> 02:30.600
- THIS HAS TO BE SPECIAL,

02:30.600 --> 02:33.233
'CAUSE IT'S THE EVENING'S
ENTERTAINMENT.

02:33.233 --> 02:36.033
SO I WANT YOU TO FEEL FREE
TO GET CREATIVE.

02:36.033 --> 02:38.267
- I'D LIKE TO FEEL FREE
TO NOT DO THIS!

02:38.267 --> 02:39.833
I'M NOT GOOD AT THIS STUFF!

02:39.833 --> 02:41.133
- OH...

02:41.133 --> 02:45.267
YOU'RE A WITTY
AND CHARMING BOY.

02:45.267 --> 02:47.500
WHY DON'T YOU DO
A FUNNY POEM?

02:47.500 --> 02:50.467
- A POEM?
NO! NO WAY, NO!

02:50.467 --> 02:53.467
- YOU DON'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT EVERYONE, RAYMOND.

02:53.467 --> 02:55.667
- YEAH!
YOU CAN'T HELP OUT?

03:01.667 --> 03:04.167
- OH...

03:04.167 --> 03:08.600
YOUR MOTHER
THINKS I AM A MORON.

03:08.600 --> 03:09.733
I AGREE TO HELP HER

03:09.733 --> 03:11.533
AND HEAT UP SOME THINGS
FOR THE PARTY TOMORROW.

03:11.533 --> 03:13.400
LISTEN TO HER DIRECTIONS
FOR ME:

03:13.400 --> 03:15.667
"DEBRA,
THESE ARE MINI QUICHES,"

03:15.667 --> 03:20.333
THEN IN PARENTHESES,
"FRENCH CHEESE PIES."

03:20.333 --> 03:22.800
"PUT IN THE OVEN TOMORROW
AT 6:00 P.M."

03:22.800 --> 03:25.233
"P.M." IS UNDERLINED.

03:25.233 --> 03:26.533
- SO WHAT?
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

03:26.533 --> 03:27.967
- OH, NO?
LISTEN TO THIS:

03:27.967 --> 03:32.033
"CAUTION--OVEN GETS HOT."

03:34.567 --> 03:36.267
- HEY, DEB.
- HEY, ROBERT.

03:36.267 --> 03:38.833
- WHAT'S UP, SHAKESPEARE?

03:38.833 --> 03:40.567
- SHUT UP!

03:40.567 --> 03:43.000
- HOW GOETH IT?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.467
- I DON'T KNOW.
HERE, LOOK AT THIS.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.900
- "IT'S NO WONDER
STAN WAS ATTRACTED TO LEE.

03:48.900 --> 03:52.367
HE'S AN ACCOUNTANT,
SO HE APPRECIATES GOOD FIGURES."

03:55.267 --> 03:57.433
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

03:57.433 --> 04:00.067
THAT LEE HAS A GOOD FIGURE?

04:00.067 --> 04:02.867
HAVE YOU SEEN LEE?

04:02.867 --> 04:04.900
- STOP IT!
I KNOW, ALL RIGHT?

04:04.900 --> 04:06.000
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.500
THESE PEOPLE
ARE NOT FUNNY.

04:07.500 --> 04:10.967
THEY PLAY CARDS AND WALK
AROUND THE MALL FOR EXERCISE.

04:10.967 --> 04:12.567
THEY'RE BORING PEOPLE.

04:12.567 --> 04:14.500
- YEAH, TOO BAD IT'S NOT
MA AND DAD'S ANNIVERSARY.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.167
THEN YOU'D HAVE MATERIAL!
- OH!

04:17.167 --> 04:19.500
YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKIN' OF
THE OTHER DAY?

04:19.500 --> 04:23.067
REMEMBER THE TIME
MOM SEWED HIS FLY SHUT?

04:24.633 --> 04:26.167
- WHAT? WHEN WAS THIS?

04:26.167 --> 04:27.600
- YEAH, WE WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL,

04:27.600 --> 04:29.167
AND SHE WAS SICK OF HIM
SITTIN' ON THE COUCH

04:29.167 --> 04:32.200
ALL OPEN AND UNZIPPED.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.633
- YEAH, IT DIDN'T WORK,
THOUGH.

04:33.633 --> 04:35.200
HE'D JUST COME HOME,
WHIP OFF HIS PANTS,

04:35.200 --> 04:38.600
AND HANG 'EM
ON THE FRONT DOORKNOB.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.300
- THEN HE'D
COME IN THE HOUSE.

04:43.300 --> 04:44.933
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:44.933 --> 04:47.100
THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO,
STUFF ABOUT YOUR PARENTS.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.800
- IT'S LEE AND STAN'S THING.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.467
- I KNOW, BUT YOU COULD DO,
LIKE, A MARRIAGE COMPARISON,

04:52.467 --> 04:54.000
YOU KNOW,
WHERE LEE AND STAN

04:54.000 --> 04:55.833
ARE A CLASSIC,
SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE,

04:55.833 --> 04:57.567
AND YOUR PARENTS ARE...

04:57.567 --> 05:00.600
LESS CLASSICAL.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.733
- THAT'S TRUE.

05:01.733 --> 05:03.300
I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE
TO BRING UP THE TIME

05:03.300 --> 05:06.600
THEY DROVE A CAR
THROUGH THE LIVING ROOM WALL.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.267
- YEAH, AS OPPOSED
TO LEE AND STAN,

05:08.267 --> 05:10.033
WHO PREFER
TO RING THE DOORBELL.

05:10.033 --> 05:13.300
[both laughing]

05:13.300 --> 05:16.000
THAT'S GOOD.
- YEAH.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.333
- YEAH.

05:17.333 --> 05:19.433
OR...OR HOW 'BOUT
THE TIME MY FATHER

05:19.433 --> 05:22.767
ACCIDENTALLY
GAVE OUT CONDOMS FOR HALLOWEEN?

05:24.900 --> 05:27.833
- HOW 'BOUT THE TIME
THAT THEY FOUGHT FOR A WEEK

05:27.833 --> 05:31.800
BECAUSE THEY WERE LITERALLY
COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES?

05:31.800 --> 05:33.567
- RIGHT...RIGHT!

05:33.567 --> 05:35.500
I REMEMBER THAT.
I HAD TO VOTE!

05:35.500 --> 05:36.867
- YEAH.

05:36.867 --> 05:38.200
THAT'S GOOD.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.733
- HEY, THIS IS
PRETTY GOOD STUFF.

05:39.733 --> 05:41.033
MAYBE WE SHOULD DO IT.

05:41.033 --> 05:42.433
YOU AND ME,
WE COULD DO, LIKE, A SKIT.

05:42.433 --> 05:44.000
- YEAH, SURE,
I'LL DO IT WITH YOU.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.800
- WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

05:45.800 --> 05:48.167
YOU CANNOT DO THAT.

05:48.167 --> 05:49.467
- WHAT?
YEAH, SURE WE CAN.

05:49.467 --> 05:51.400
YOU CAN BE LEE
AND MY MOM,

05:51.400 --> 05:53.033
AND I'LL BE STAN
AND MY DAD.

05:53.033 --> 05:54.733
- OH, THAT WOULD BE HILARIOUS.
- YEAH.

05:54.733 --> 05:56.833
WHAT ELSE WE GOT ON 'EM,
LIKE THE PANTS THING?

05:56.833 --> 05:58.200
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

05:58.200 --> 05:59.267
LOOK, WHEN I SAID THAT,
I WASN'T SERIOUS.

05:59.267 --> 06:00.700
COUNT ME OUT.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.500
- ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE OUT.
SO HOW SHOULD WE DO IT?

06:04.867 --> 06:06.500
- NOW--NOW, LOOK. LOOK.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.867
REALLY--LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, RAY.

06:08.867 --> 06:11.433
THIS STUFF
IS NOT FUNNY.

06:11.433 --> 06:12.767
- WHAT?
YOU WERE JUST LAUGHIN'.

06:12.767 --> 06:14.667
- YEAH, BUT THAT WAS
BEHIND THEIR BACKS.

06:14.667 --> 06:18.133
THIS WOULD BE
IN FRONT OF THEIR FACES

06:18.133 --> 06:19.533
WITH ALL THEIR FRIENDS
WATCHING.

06:19.533 --> 06:21.433
- YEAH, SEE, THAT'S RIGHT,
THEIR FRIENDS,

06:21.433 --> 06:24.133
SO EVERYBODY WOULD KNOW
WE WERE JUST KIDDIN' AROUND.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.500
- YEAH.
- NO.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.767
I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU SHOULDN'T DO THIS.

06:26.767 --> 06:28.033
IT WOULD JUST HUMILIATE THEM,

06:28.033 --> 06:30.467
AND YOUR CHILDREN
WILL BE WATCHING!

06:30.467 --> 06:32.067
- THE KIDS ARE GONNA BE
AT A SLEEPOVER,

06:32.067 --> 06:34.500
AND MOM AND DAD
ARE UNHUMILIATABLE.

06:36.767 --> 06:39.633
- I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS IS VERY RISKY.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.200
- NO...IT'S FUNNY.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.967
I THINK IT'S FUNNY.
ISN'T IT FUNNY?

06:42.967 --> 06:45.733
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.

06:45.733 --> 06:47.633
- AH, MAYBE
WE SHOULDN'T DO IT.

06:47.633 --> 06:49.233
- HEY, YOU KNOW
WHAT I ALWAYS LIKE?

06:49.233 --> 06:50.900
A GOOD SONG PARODY.

06:50.900 --> 06:53.233
- A SONG PARODY?
LIKE WHAT?

06:53.233 --> 06:54.767
- HOW 'BOUT SOMETHING LIKE...

06:54.767 --> 06:56.267
[singing to the tune
of "Comin' Round the Mountain"]

06:56.267 --> 07:00.167
LEE AND STAN
HAVE BEEN MARRIED 45 YEARS

07:00.167 --> 07:03.533
LEE AND STAN HAVE BEEN MARRIED
45 YEARS

07:03.533 --> 07:05.533
OH, THEY LIKE
TO PLAY CANASTA

07:05.533 --> 07:07.433
AND TAKE WALKS
AROUND THE MALLS

07:07.433 --> 07:13.567
AND WHY NOT?
IT'S MARVELOUS EXERCISE

07:19.467 --> 07:21.033
- I THINK THE SKIT IS FUNNY.

07:21.033 --> 07:22.500
- WE'RE GONNA DO A SKIT.
WE'RE GONNA DO A SKIT.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.667
- SO OKAY, I'LL BE YOUR MOM...

07:29.633 --> 07:30.767
[all laughing]

07:30.767 --> 07:33.033
- OKAY, WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.
- AND FINALLY...

07:33.033 --> 07:36.467
THIS IS HOW LEE AND STAN
MIGHT VISIT SOMEONE'S HOME.

07:37.733 --> 07:38.933
DING-DONG!

07:38.933 --> 07:40.733
HELLO!
THANK YOU FOR INVITING US.

07:40.733 --> 07:42.867
- OH, STAN,
ISN'T THIS A LOVELY HOUSE?

07:42.867 --> 07:45.600
- IT CERTAINLY IS,
AND YOU ARE LOVELY TOO, LEE.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.700
- OH, THANK YOU, STAN.
I LOVE YOU.

07:48.700 --> 07:51.567
- AND I LOVE YOU, LEE.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.500
NOW...

07:54.500 --> 07:56.200
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT HOW FRANK AND MARIE

07:56.200 --> 07:59.533
MIGHT VISIT SOMEONE'S HOME,
SHALL WE?

08:01.967 --> 08:03.800
- DO YOU THINK
RAYMOND IS HOME?

08:03.800 --> 08:04.800
- LET'S FIND OUT.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.700
both: BA-BOOM!

08:10.133 --> 08:11.933
- HELLO, DEARS.

08:11.933 --> 08:14.033
- MAKE ME SOMETHIN' TO EAT!

08:14.033 --> 08:15.367
- DON'T MIND ME.

08:15.367 --> 08:17.900
I'LL JUST BE GOING
THROUGH YOUR MAIL.

08:17.900 --> 08:20.533
- AND I'LL JUST BE WATCHING
YOUR TELEVISION.

08:33.067 --> 08:35.867
- OH, FRANK,
ZIP UP YOUR PANTS!

08:35.867 --> 08:38.567
- ZIP UP YOUR MOUTH!

08:38.567 --> 08:41.500
- OH, MY GOD, LOOK
WHAT THEY LEAVE LYING AROUND,

08:41.500 --> 08:44.200
THE "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED"
SWIMSUIT ISSUE.

08:44.200 --> 08:48.067
- HOLY CRAP! GIVE ME THAT!

08:48.067 --> 08:50.867
- FRANK, YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT
WHAT REAL WOMEN LOOK LIKE.

08:50.867 --> 08:53.533
- NO KIDDING.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.967
- AND JUST WHAT MAGAZINE
ARE YOU IN, FRANK,

08:55.967 --> 08:58.200
"BALD AND GASSY"?

08:59.267 --> 09:00.500
- HEY, MY PROBLEM IS,

09:00.500 --> 09:03.600
I GOT A LIFETIME SUBSCRIPTION
TO YOU!

09:03.600 --> 09:06.133
- AND I CAN CANCEL IT
AT ANY TIME!

09:06.133 --> 09:07.833
- MAKE ME SOMETHIN' TO EAT!

09:07.833 --> 09:09.467
- MAKE IT YOURSELF!

09:09.467 --> 09:13.133
- IF I COULD MAKE IT MYSELF,
YOU'D BE OUT ON THE CURB!

09:13.133 --> 09:15.233
- YOU'D LOVE THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

09:15.233 --> 09:16.500
- I THINK WE'D BOTH LOVE IT.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.333
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
WE BOTH LOVE?

09:18.333 --> 09:21.733
both: LEE AND STAN!
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!

09:21.733 --> 09:24.767
- OH, THAT'S GREAT.

09:24.767 --> 09:27.067
THAT WAS SO FUNNY.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.933
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

09:28.933 --> 09:30.800
I WAS CRYING, LAUGHING.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.433
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

09:32.433 --> 09:34.600
- IT'S BETTER
THAN BROADWAY.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.633
- I DIDN'T LIKE IT.
TOO MUCH LEE AND STAN.

09:37.633 --> 09:39.000
[laughter]

09:39.000 --> 09:40.433
- THAT WAS WONDERFUL!

09:40.433 --> 09:43.200
I LIKED WHEN YOU CALLED HIM
"BALD AND GASSY."

09:44.433 --> 09:48.700
- I KNEW HIM
WHEN HE WAS JUST GASSY.

09:48.700 --> 09:50.533
- LOOK WHO'S TALKING!

09:50.533 --> 09:53.400
- I SAID TO FRANK,
"THAT'S YOU TO A 'T'!"

09:53.400 --> 09:55.067
- YOU HAD THIS ONE DOWN
PERFECTLY.

09:55.067 --> 09:56.700
I WAS PETRIFIED!

09:56.700 --> 09:59.900
- WELL, WE'RE GLAD
YOU COULD ENJOY IT.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.867
- BETTER THAN BROADWAY.

10:02.867 --> 10:04.767
- THANK YOU.
- THANKS.

10:04.767 --> 10:06.433
- ALL RIGHT.
- LET'S GET A DRINK.

10:06.433 --> 10:08.400
- ALL RIGHT.
NOW WE CAN ENJOY OURSELVES.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.167
- WELL, RAYMOND,
IT'S OFFICIAL:

10:10.167 --> 10:13.767
THEY LOVE YOU
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO.

10:13.767 --> 10:15.367
- NO MATTER WHAT I DO?

10:15.367 --> 10:18.900
YOU MEAN LIKE PROVIDE
CROWD-PLEASING ENTERTAINMENT?

10:18.900 --> 10:22.267
- IT JUST SHOULD BE NOTED
THAT EVERYBODY WAS DRUNK.

10:23.700 --> 10:26.100
- DRUNK WITH LAUGHTER.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.333
- OH, MY, MY, MY.

10:27.333 --> 10:28.900
YOU KNOW, I EXPECT THAT
FROM RAYMOND

10:28.900 --> 10:30.333
BUT NOT FROM YOU,
DEBRA.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.067
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED.

10:32.067 --> 10:35.567
- [singing] NO ONE'S GOING
TO LISTEN TO ROBERT ANYMORE

10:35.567 --> 10:38.567
NO ONE'S GOING TO LISTEN
TO ROBERT ANYMORE

10:38.567 --> 10:39.767
- ALL RIGHT!

10:39.767 --> 10:41.567
- [singing] YOU WERE WRONG
AND WE WERE FUNNY

10:41.567 --> 10:45.367
AND YOU CAN'T STAND IT,
HONEY

10:45.367 --> 10:47.933
DID I MENTION THAT YOU'RE
DUE BACK AT THE ZOO?

10:47.933 --> 10:50.733
[both laughing]

10:50.733 --> 10:53.967
- OH, WE SHOULD HAVE DONE
THE SONG.

10:53.967 --> 10:56.033
[laughs]

10:56.033 --> 10:57.500
- WE COULD HAVE DONE THE SONG.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.133
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THAT SONG.

10:59.133 --> 11:00.267
- GOOD-BYE, MAX.

11:00.267 --> 11:02.500
- THANK YOU, DEAR.
VERY NICE.

11:03.800 --> 11:05.367
- THANKS FOR COMING,
GARVIN.

11:05.367 --> 11:08.800
- GREAT PARTY!
FIRST-CLASS ENTERTAINMENT.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.500
HEY, RAY, DEBRA...
[laughs]

11:11.500 --> 11:13.200
- HEY, THANK YOU, GARVIN.
THANK YOU.

11:13.200 --> 11:16.600
- HEY, ROBERT, I WANT TO SEE YOU
IN THERE NEXT TIME.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.600
YOU COULD BE, LIKE, A--
A BIG INDIAN

11:19.600 --> 11:24.800
OR A--OR A--A BIG,
FUNNY, GALUMPH-Y WAITER.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.067
[laughs]

11:27.067 --> 11:29.567
BYE!
all: BYE.

11:34.267 --> 11:35.967
- NEVER LIKED THAT GUY.

11:35.967 --> 11:39.267
- MARIE,
THIS WAS TERRIFIC.

11:39.267 --> 11:41.633
- ABSOLUTELY.
GARVIN WAS RIGHT.

11:41.633 --> 11:44.300
YOUR SHOW WAS TOP-NOTCH.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.600
- THANKS.
THANK YOU.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.800
- JUST REMEMBER
WHO GOT RAYMOND TO DO IT.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.067
- WELL, COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT DEBRA.

11:50.067 --> 11:52.033
- WELL, WE HAD
GREAT INSPIRATION.

11:52.033 --> 11:55.233
- SHE'S RIGHT.
WITHOUT US, NO SHOW.

11:55.233 --> 11:56.233
- THAT'S TRUE.

11:56.233 --> 11:58.300
- YOU TWO WERE SO GOOD.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.200
- YOU KNOW, YOU AND FRANK
BETTER GET READY,

12:00.200 --> 12:01.933
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT

12:01.933 --> 12:03.033
FOR THEIR ANNIVERSARY.

12:03.033 --> 12:06.100
- OH, THAT, I'D LOVE TO SEE.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.600
- WE WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.067
- ARE YOU KIDDIN'?
IT'D BE A PIECE OF CAKE!

12:10.067 --> 12:12.333
- OH, YEAH?
- GIVE US A LITTLE, FRANK.

12:12.333 --> 12:15.233
- NO, NO, NO.
YOU TWO JUST DO US SOME MORE.

12:15.233 --> 12:16.633
- NO, NO. GO AHEAD.

12:16.633 --> 12:19.133
- [imitating Ray]
"NO, NO. GO AHEAD."

12:19.133 --> 12:22.400
- THAT'S HIM!
WITH THE NASAL VOICE.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.467
- YEAH, NASAL VOICE,
ALL RIGHT.

12:24.467 --> 12:26.000
- [whining]
OH, I HURT MY PINKIE

12:26.000 --> 12:29.700
WHEN I WAS TYPING!

12:29.700 --> 12:33.000
THE KEYS WERE SO HARD!

12:33.000 --> 12:35.867
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE!

12:35.867 --> 12:37.433
- [laughs]

12:37.433 --> 12:38.833
- [imitating Debra]
OH, STOP, RAY.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.467
I'M TRYING TO HEAT UP
SOUP FROM A CAN...

12:47.233 --> 12:50.733
AND IT'S VERY TRICKY.

12:54.233 --> 12:56.200
- THAT'S YOU, DONNA!

12:56.200 --> 13:00.400
- [laughs]
IT'S DEBRA.

13:00.400 --> 13:04.800
- WHO CARES?
PAY MORE ATTENTION TO ME!

13:04.800 --> 13:07.700
I'M A NEEDY, WHINY BABY!

13:07.700 --> 13:09.033
MY PINKIE!

13:09.033 --> 13:11.767
OH!

13:11.767 --> 13:14.067
- STOP! STOP!

13:21.467 --> 13:24.933
- RAY, YOU NEVER HELP ME
WITH ANYTHING AROUND HERE.

13:24.933 --> 13:27.300
IDIOT.

13:28.733 --> 13:29.967
- YOU'RE SO MEAN TO ME!

13:29.967 --> 13:32.500
I WANT MY MOMMY!

13:38.033 --> 13:41.633
- [laughing]

13:41.633 --> 13:44.600
- THEN GO OVER THERE,
BECAUSE I'M TOO BUSY

13:44.600 --> 13:47.067
TO BE NICE TO YOU.

13:48.700 --> 13:49.867
- THAT'S PERFECT,

13:49.867 --> 13:52.500
'CAUSE SHE'S SO MEAN TO HIM,
ALWAYS!

13:53.833 --> 13:55.700
- AND HE'S SUCH A BABY!

13:55.700 --> 13:56.700
- I AM NOT!

13:56.700 --> 13:59.500
- SEE?
[laughs]

13:59.500 --> 14:03.200
- STOP! MY STOMACH!
YOU'RE KILLING ME!

14:05.533 --> 14:06.933
- MORE!
[laughs]

14:06.933 --> 14:08.567
DO SOME MORE!

14:08.567 --> 14:10.400
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S GETTIN' KIND OF LATE.

14:10.400 --> 14:13.033
- YEAH, YEAH, IT IS.
IT REALLY IS.

14:13.033 --> 14:15.567
- HEY, HEY, DAD,
DO HOW HE HAS NO ASS!

14:25.133 --> 14:27.000
- I'M SORRY,
BUT THAT IS MESSED UP!

14:28.167 --> 14:30.433
I MEAN,
THAT IS JUST NOT FUNNY!

14:30.433 --> 14:31.967
- WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?

14:31.967 --> 14:33.600
- WHY?
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO CLASS.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.000
NO CLASS!

14:35.000 --> 14:38.900
- RAYMOND, YOU LEFT WITHOUT
SAYING GOOD-BYE TO LEE AND STAN.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.233
THAT WAS RUDE.

14:40.233 --> 14:41.867
- YEAH, WHERE ARE
YOUR MANNERS?

14:41.867 --> 14:43.533
- ME, MANNERS?
YOU, MANNERS!

14:43.533 --> 14:44.967
YOU WERE RIGHT.
YOU WERE RIGHT, MAN.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.467
THEY HAVE NO SENSE OF HUMOR.

14:46.467 --> 14:48.167
- I THINK THEY'RE
THE FEEL-GOOD HIT OF THE SEASON.

14:48.167 --> 14:50.400
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
RAYMOND?

14:50.400 --> 14:52.233
- OH, COME ON, MA,
YOU DIDN'T LIKE OUR SKIT,

14:52.233 --> 14:53.900
SO YOU WENT OUT OF YOUR WAY
TO EMBARRASS US.

14:53.900 --> 14:56.033
- WE LOVED YOUR SKIT.
DIDN'T WE, FRANK?

14:56.033 --> 14:57.600
- YEAH,
FOR THOSE FIVE MINUTES,

14:57.600 --> 15:00.833
I DIDN'T MIND EVERYBODY
DRINKIN' MY BOOZE.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.000
- OKAY, YOU KNOW,
LET'S JUST BE HONEST, ALL RIGHT?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.300
WE'RE SORRY
WE MADE FUN OF YOU.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.100
WE'RE SORRY
WE HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.267
- HURT OUR FEELINGS?
WE WERE LAUGHING.

15:08.267 --> 15:10.367
EVERYBODY WAS LAUGHING.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.833
- WELL, THEN WHY'D YOU
LASH OUT AT US?

15:11.833 --> 15:14.600
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

15:14.600 --> 15:17.233
WE WERE BEIN' FUNNY,
JUST LIKE YOU.

15:17.233 --> 15:19.233
- BEIN' FUNNY, JUST LIKE US.

15:19.233 --> 15:22.333
LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING
ABOUT HUMOR TO YOU PEOPLE.

15:30.833 --> 15:32.400
YEAH, SEE?
RIGHT THERE.

15:32.400 --> 15:36.000
THAT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE
OF SOMETHING THAT IS NOT FUNNY.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.667
AND ALSO UGLY.

15:42.467 --> 15:43.933
I THINK
THAT YOU NEED TO LEARN

15:43.933 --> 15:47.633
THAT USUALLY WHAT MAKES
SOMETHING FUNNY IS ITS TONE,

15:47.633 --> 15:49.767
A LIGHT, COMIC FEELING.

15:49.767 --> 15:52.133
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING
DURING OUR SKIT:

15:52.133 --> 15:54.700
WE HAD THE SPIRIT OF FUN
ABOUT US.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.167
THEREFORE,
THE AUDIENCE WAS FREE

15:56.167 --> 15:57.933
TO FEEL COMFORTABLE
AND AMUSED.

15:57.933 --> 16:01.100
- WILL THIS LECTURE BE AVAILABLE
ON AUDIOCASSETTE?

16:04.833 --> 16:06.133
- I'M TELLING YOU, RAY,

16:06.133 --> 16:08.267
I HEARD PEOPLE LAUGHING
AT OUR STUFF TOO.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.167
- YEAH, OKAY FINE,
IF YOU WANT THAT KIND OF LAUGH.

16:10.167 --> 16:11.500
THOSE WERE CHEAP LAUGHS.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.300
- THEY WERE?
- OF COURSE THEY WERE.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.100
OH, GRANNY SAID "IDIOT."

16:15.100 --> 16:16.533
WHAT'S CLEVER ABOUT THAT?

16:16.533 --> 16:18.667
- YEAH, AND WHEN DID I
EVER DO THIS?

16:22.633 --> 16:24.500
- ALL RIGHT,
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT:

16:24.500 --> 16:26.500
IT'S OKAY TO POKE FUN
AT MOM AND DAD,

16:26.500 --> 16:28.833
BUT YOU GUYS
ARE STRICTLY OFF-LIMITS?

16:28.833 --> 16:30.967
- NO, NO...

16:30.967 --> 16:33.900
NO.

16:33.900 --> 16:35.367
- I MEAN,
COME ON, ROBERT!

16:35.367 --> 16:37.133
THERE IS A HUGE
DIFFERENCE HERE!

16:37.133 --> 16:39.167
WE HAD TO THINK UP
WHAT WE WERE GONNA SAY.

16:39.167 --> 16:40.833
THEY WERE SO READY
WITH THEIR ATTACK!

16:40.833 --> 16:42.133
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,

16:42.133 --> 16:43.467
LIKE YOU PRACTICE IT
IN YOUR BASEMENT.

16:43.467 --> 16:44.700
- YEAH.

16:44.700 --> 16:47.033
- AH...YOU KNOW,
I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE

16:47.033 --> 16:49.600
IS THAT HUMOR,
WHILE SO OFTEN A TONIC,

16:49.600 --> 16:54.200
CAN BE A POISON TO THOSE
UNPREPARED TO TAKE IT.

16:54.200 --> 16:58.600
both: AH.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.800
- YEAH, YEAH, GREAT.

16:59.800 --> 17:04.100
WHY DON'T YOU
BA-DOO-DEE-DO OUT OF HERE?

17:04.100 --> 17:06.367
- OKAY...

17:06.367 --> 17:08.267
NOW, SEE,
A LINE LIKE THAT

17:08.267 --> 17:09.900
JUST ROLLS OFF MY BACK,

17:09.900 --> 17:14.533
WHEREAS IF I CALL YOU A NAME
LIKE "NOSY NOSENSTEIN"...

17:17.100 --> 17:19.767
YOU GET YOUR BIG HONKER
ALL OUT OF WHACK.

17:22.067 --> 17:23.700
BEEP! BEEP!

17:32.100 --> 17:34.667
- LOOK, OUR SKIT
WAS ALL IN FUN.

17:34.667 --> 17:37.400
WE WERE EVEN WORRIED
ABOUT OFFENDING YOU.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.000
- WHY WOULD YOU
BE OFFENDING US?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.767
- YEAH, YOU THINK YOU'RE
TELLING US STUFF WE DON'T KNOW?

17:41.767 --> 17:44.633
MARIE KNOWS
SHE'S A BIG PAIN IN THE ASS.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.033
- AND FRANK KNOWS
HE'S A PIG WITH SHOES.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.000
- HEY, YEAH, I TELL YOU
WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FUNNY--

17:55.000 --> 17:56.300
IF YOU HAD TALKED
ABOUT THE TIME

17:56.300 --> 17:58.167
WE DROVE THE CAR
THROUGH YOUR HOUSE.

17:58.167 --> 18:03.067
[both laughing]

18:03.067 --> 18:05.467
- NOW, THAT WAS HYSTERICAL!

18:07.533 --> 18:08.867
- OKAY, BUT--

18:08.867 --> 18:13.567
YOU KNOW, I REALLY DID
HURT MY PINKIE THAT TIME.

18:13.567 --> 18:15.967
- OH, RAYMOND...

18:15.967 --> 18:17.867
RAYMOND...

18:17.867 --> 18:19.533
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME:

18:19.533 --> 18:21.733
WE DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS

18:21.733 --> 18:24.400
WITH OUR LITTLE IMITATIONS.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.300
BUT NOW THAT I KNOW
YOU BOTH ARE SO SENSITIVE,

18:27.300 --> 18:32.433
WE WILL NEVER MAKE
THOSE KINDS OF JOKES AGAIN.

18:32.433 --> 18:34.633
ALL RIGHT?

18:36.800 --> 18:38.900
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.

18:38.900 --> 18:42.033
I MEAN, YOU'RE IMPLYING
THAT WE CAN'T TAKE A JOKE.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.467
AND OF COURSE WE CAN.

18:43.467 --> 18:45.100
- OF COURSE WE CAN.
I LOVE TO TAKE A JOKE.

18:45.100 --> 18:48.500
- YES, NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT
YOU WERE JUST KIDDING AROUND,

18:48.500 --> 18:49.567
WE ARE FINE.

18:49.567 --> 18:51.333
WE LAUGH AT OURSELVES
ALL THE TIME.

18:51.333 --> 18:52.633
- ALL THE TIME.
WE'RE LAUGHIN'.

18:52.633 --> 18:54.500
WE'RE JOKIN' ALL THE TIME.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.200
- I MEAN, EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT HE'S KIND OF A WHINY BABY

18:56.200 --> 18:57.500
WHO NEEDS HIS MOMMY

18:57.500 --> 18:59.433
AND NEVER DOES ANYTHING
AROUND THE HOUSE.

18:59.433 --> 19:00.967
- THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:00.967 --> 19:02.967
AND YOU'RE LIKE AN UPTIGHT,
CRANKY YELL MACHINE.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.633
[both laughing]

19:04.633 --> 19:08.100
WITH STICK-OUT-Y EARS.

19:08.100 --> 19:09.300
- YEAH, SO YOU SEE,

19:09.300 --> 19:11.567
WE HAVE A PERFECTLY GOOD
SENSE OF HUMOR.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.700
- SO EVERYBODY'S OKAY, THEN?

19:13.700 --> 19:14.700
both: YEAH, SURE.

19:14.700 --> 19:15.900
- ABSOLUTELY.
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

19:15.900 --> 19:19.100
WE'RE FUN PEOPLE!

19:19.100 --> 19:20.967
- OKAY, GOOD.
- OKAY.

19:20.967 --> 19:23.867
- OH, I'M SO RELIEVED.

19:23.867 --> 19:25.400
- YEAH, ME TOO,

19:25.400 --> 19:29.133
'CAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY
I WAS GONNA STOP WITH THE JOKES.

19:29.133 --> 19:30.633
- WE DON'T WANT YOU TO.

19:30.633 --> 19:32.400
- NO WAY. THAT'S WHAT FAMILIES
ARE ALL ABOUT.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.000
- GOOD NIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD NIGHT.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.333
- THAT WAS FUN.
[laughs]

19:36.333 --> 19:37.800
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I GOT TO TELL YOU,

19:37.800 --> 19:39.433
I REALLY MISJUDGED YOU GUYS.

19:39.433 --> 19:42.033
YOU'RE MUCH BETTER SPORTS
THAN I GAVE YOU CREDIT FOR.

19:42.033 --> 19:43.967
AND YOUR SKIT WAS FUNNY TOO.

19:43.967 --> 19:45.900
- THANKS, ROBERT.
- THANKS, MAN.

19:45.900 --> 19:48.633
- YOU KNOW,
LIKE I ALWAYS SAY:

19:48.633 --> 19:50.333
"LIVE, LOVE, LAUGH."

19:53.233 --> 19:55.000
I'LL SEE YOU.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.667
- "CRANKY, UPTIGHT
YELL MACHINE"?

20:02.667 --> 20:05.867
- HEY, WHOA! WHAT ABOUT YOU?
"WHINY BABY, NEEDY MOMMY!"

20:05.867 --> 20:07.767
- I ONLY SAY THAT
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE!

20:07.767 --> 20:09.167
- OH, LOOK OUT.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.333
DON'T WANT TO TURN ON
THE YELL MACHINE,

20:10.333 --> 20:11.833
'CAUSE THERE'S NO OFF SWITCH!

20:11.833 --> 20:13.567
- "MOMMY! MOMMY! MOMMY!
MY WIFE IS BEING MEAN TO ME."

20:13.567 --> 20:16.067
- MEH, MEH, MEH, MEH,
MEH, MEH, MEH!

20:16.067 --> 20:17.567
- OH, YEAH.
THAT'S A GOOD COMEBACK.

20:17.567 --> 20:19.500
- "THAT'S A GOOD COMEBACK."

20:19.500 --> 20:20.967
- OH, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
- "OH, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE."

20:20.967 --> 20:23.400
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
- MEH, MEH, MEH!

20:42.433 --> 20:43.733
- 10.

20:46.733 --> 20:48.433
11.

20:51.100 --> 20:53.000
WAIT A MINUTE.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.700
THERE'S A TEASPOON MISSING.

20:58.067 --> 20:59.600
THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
12 TEASPOONS.

20:59.600 --> 21:03.067
THERE'S ONLY 11.
MA, WHAT THE HELL?

21:03.067 --> 21:05.300
- WHAT ARE YOU YAPPIN' ABOUT?

21:05.300 --> 21:07.000
- THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
12 TEASPOONS.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.600
THIS IS AN INCOMPLETE SET!

21:09.600 --> 21:14.133
- WHAT PARTY ARE YOU GONNA GIVE
WITH 12 GUESTS?

21:14.133 --> 21:18.333
- A BIG PARTY, 'CAUSE IT'LL BE
THE READING OF YOUR WILL!

21:20.433 --> 21:21.933
MAYBE IT GOT SCRAPED
INTO THE TRASH CAN.

21:21.933 --> 21:23.367
MAYBE IT'S IN THE TRASH.

21:33.900 --> 21:35.767
[knocking]

21:46.800 --> 21:48.600
THAT IS NOT FUNNY!
