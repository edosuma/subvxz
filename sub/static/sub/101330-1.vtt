00:37.927 --> 00:40.430
<i>Dash! Dash!</i>

00:41.298 --> 00:42.634
<i>Dash!</i>

00:43.667 --> 00:44.835
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

01:25.509 --> 01:27.311
Cover me!

01:43.560 --> 01:44.829
<i>Miller!</i>

03:02.806 --> 03:03.908
Is that it?

03:06.710 --> 03:08.546
Project 725.

03:17.454 --> 03:19.490
If you provide a server
powerful enough,

03:19.522 --> 03:21.793
the A.I. will run off this.

03:23.127 --> 03:26.531
So small, yet so powerful.

03:29.766 --> 03:31.368
This...

03:32.902 --> 03:35.572
is how we change the world.

04:31.627 --> 04:32.997
<i>Need some help up here, hurry!</i>

04:34.898 --> 04:36.867
<i>Miller!</i>

04:36.899 --> 04:38.935
<i>Don't leave me!</i>

05:39.696 --> 05:41.932
You did it.
Good job, good job.

06:09.759 --> 06:11.127
Boy.

06:13.697 --> 06:15.500
Derek Miller.

06:19.069 --> 06:22.105
- Donovan Chalmers.
- Pleasure.

06:22.139 --> 06:23.941
Welcome to Chapter House.

06:31.113 --> 06:32.516
I read up on you.

06:33.250 --> 06:34.985
Impressive stuff.

06:35.017 --> 06:36.686
Just doing my duty.

06:36.720 --> 06:39.223
Spoken like
a true soldier.

06:39.255 --> 06:41.925
Well, it takes one
to know one, right?

06:43.694 --> 06:45.329
Ah, you did your homework.

06:45.362 --> 06:47.231
Yes, sir.

06:47.264 --> 06:49.233
It's not every day you get
to meet a ground and pounder

06:49.266 --> 06:51.100
turned CEO.

06:51.134 --> 06:54.271
75th Regiment,
Task Force Ranger...

06:54.303 --> 06:55.638
B Company.

06:55.672 --> 06:57.041
Mogadishu?

06:57.807 --> 06:59.909
Mogadishu,

06:59.942 --> 07:02.178
Somalia, Bosnia...

07:03.279 --> 07:04.614
Iraq.

07:04.648 --> 07:06.684
Quite the career change.

07:06.716 --> 07:07.752
Why the switch?

07:08.250 --> 07:09.887
Hm.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.254
Family life...

07:12.755 --> 07:14.691
changes everything.

07:15.791 --> 07:17.226
Yeah.

07:17.259 --> 07:19.697
Your refrence spoke
very highly of you.

07:21.264 --> 07:22.833
Is that right?

07:33.410 --> 07:35.379
And who was it that referred me?

07:35.411 --> 07:37.680
I did, you son of a bitch.

07:37.713 --> 07:39.315
Fox! Look at you.

07:39.348 --> 07:40.817
Uh-oh.

07:42.218 --> 07:43.887
"Suits and ties
are for pussies."

07:43.920 --> 07:45.187
Oh, man.

07:45.221 --> 07:48.024
Maggie wanted me out of the game
while I still had all my limbs.

07:48.057 --> 07:50.293
- Wives.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

07:50.326 --> 07:53.797
She made me sell
my soul for a fancy 401(k).

07:53.829 --> 07:55.865
- Looking good.
- Thank you, brother.

07:55.899 --> 07:57.300
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

07:57.334 --> 07:58.836
- Right.
- Hey, Fox...

07:58.869 --> 07:59.903
Yes, sir?

07:59.935 --> 08:01.838
Walk Derek
through the proposal.

08:06.242 --> 08:08.745
I'm sure you recognize
your old friend,

08:08.778 --> 08:10.346
the Pardoner.

08:10.379 --> 08:12.850
The terrorist revolutionary
who's been raising hell

08:12.882 --> 08:15.318
all over the globe
for the past two years.

08:15.351 --> 08:17.053
How could I forget him?

08:17.086 --> 08:19.122
He put a bullet
in my back.

08:19.156 --> 08:21.125
Still have the scar
to prove it.

08:24.293 --> 08:27.697
What's this have to do
with Chapter House?

08:27.730 --> 08:29.966
Last week,
the Pardoner stole

08:30.000 --> 08:31.935
a piece of Chapter House
technology.

08:31.968 --> 08:35.339
A piece of proprietary tech that
we do not need in hands like his.

08:35.739 --> 08:37.140
Why's that?

08:38.442 --> 08:40.711
Could be bad.

08:40.744 --> 08:42.913
"Could be bad?"
Bad for who?

08:42.946 --> 08:44.148
Bad for you?

08:45.816 --> 08:47.752
Bad for everyone.

08:49.852 --> 08:51.754
Flight 314...

08:51.788 --> 08:53.057
Crashed off the coast,

08:53.090 --> 08:54.925
no survivors.

08:54.957 --> 08:58.194
Now, we have reason to believe
that the Pardoner is liable.

08:58.227 --> 09:00.263
Now, fortunate for us,

09:00.297 --> 09:02.800
we put a fail-safe on the
trigger of the device,

09:02.832 --> 09:05.235
just in case
for circumstances like this.

09:05.268 --> 09:07.237
That's good, right?

09:07.269 --> 09:08.370
Yeah...

09:08.404 --> 09:11.408
but there's only one man
that has the code to decrypt it.

09:11.441 --> 09:13.978
And now that man is
a high-value target.

09:14.945 --> 09:16.980
That man is me.

09:19.883 --> 09:22.352
The board put a trip
on the books for Mr. Chalmers

09:22.384 --> 09:24.288
<i>to check out a site
for a new factory.</i>

09:24.321 --> 09:26.190
<i>Now, it's an old warehouse</i>

09:26.222 --> 09:29.926
that they're dying to tear down,
but we need to act fast.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.329
Tax incentives,
credits, rebates...

09:32.361 --> 09:34.230
Billions on the line.

09:34.264 --> 09:35.733
So, what?

09:35.765 --> 09:38.435
You want me and my team
to babysit you?

09:38.869 --> 09:40.237
Come on.

09:40.269 --> 09:42.740
Hey. This is a lay-up.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.842
Okay, maybe nothing happens,

09:44.875 --> 09:46.210
but you and your team,
you go in,

09:46.243 --> 09:48.345
you go home
with an easy payday.

09:50.279 --> 09:51.682
Or maybe...

09:51.715 --> 09:55.219
Maybe you get another chance to go
another round with the Pardoner.

09:58.053 --> 09:59.990
I don't know, Nick.

10:00.023 --> 10:01.925
We don't usually
do security detail.

10:01.957 --> 10:03.927
Come on.
I need you on this one.

10:05.828 --> 10:07.764
Can't you call in
some favors?

10:07.798 --> 10:09.466
Get a couple more
teams involved?

10:09.499 --> 10:11.902
The Pardoner is a former Tier-1
turned radical.

10:11.934 --> 10:14.103
His influences run deep.

10:14.136 --> 10:16.973
Now, we can't risk
the possibility of infiltration.

10:17.407 --> 10:19.243
I can trust you.

10:19.275 --> 10:21.811
I can't say the same thing
about my other contacts.

10:23.413 --> 10:24.849
Remember Darfur?

10:25.615 --> 10:29.119
I'm the one
that saved your ass.

10:29.152 --> 10:31.288
I figured you owe me
on this one.

10:33.423 --> 10:37.260
Chapter House has
unlimited resources.

10:37.293 --> 10:41.097
We're prepared to offer you
a very lucrative contract.

10:41.130 --> 10:43.166
Lots of zeroes, buddy.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.070
Lots of zeroes.

10:56.178 --> 10:57.480
Okay.

10:57.514 --> 11:00.984
If we do this,
we do it my way.

11:01.017 --> 11:04.021
You clue me in
on everything.

11:04.053 --> 11:06.023
And everything
goes through me.

11:06.056 --> 11:08.025
No questions asked.

11:09.024 --> 11:11.095
Then you'll do it?

11:13.028 --> 11:14.331
Yeah.

11:23.606 --> 11:25.141
Uh, Crystal,
can I have two beers?

11:25.174 --> 11:26.509
- Sure.
- Thank you.

11:27.644 --> 11:29.078
What'd you do last night?

11:29.111 --> 11:30.514
A little bit of laundry.

11:30.547 --> 11:32.249
- Party girl.
- Yeah.

11:32.282 --> 11:35.118
You got anything
for tonight planned?

11:35.150 --> 11:36.919
Washing the dog.

11:36.952 --> 11:38.288
Okay.

11:39.188 --> 11:41.324
All right, well,
I'll catch you later.

11:41.357 --> 11:43.059
Have fun with your dog.

11:43.559 --> 11:45.061
Your usual, honey?

11:45.095 --> 11:46.562
Yes, please.

11:46.596 --> 11:48.465
Club soda with lime.

11:49.365 --> 11:50.634
Thank you.

11:50.667 --> 11:52.903
What's wrong?
You seem down.

11:55.337 --> 11:56.439
Just stuff.

12:06.048 --> 12:09.119
What's up, buddy?
Nice to see you.

12:09.152 --> 12:10.921
Dude, do you think
I should talk to her?

12:10.953 --> 12:12.088
- Her?
- Yeah.

12:12.121 --> 12:13.923
Oh, absolutely.

12:13.956 --> 12:17.126
You can't let a girl like that
drink by herself now, can ya?

12:18.193 --> 12:19.495
Uh...

12:19.528 --> 12:21.398
What do you think...

12:21.431 --> 12:23.333
Listen, listen.

12:23.365 --> 12:25.401
That's not just some girl.

12:25.434 --> 12:28.504
That's a woman.
A real woman.

12:28.538 --> 12:30.206
Now, you be brave.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.442
And you slide
right over there,

12:32.475 --> 12:34.510
you look her
in the fucking eyes,

12:34.543 --> 12:35.946
you kiss her.

12:35.979 --> 12:37.180
All right?

12:37.212 --> 12:39.115
Chicks love that shit.

12:39.149 --> 12:41.184
Go get 'em, big guy.

12:45.020 --> 12:47.290
- There you go!
- Fuck it!

12:48.224 --> 12:49.493
You are an asshole.

12:49.525 --> 12:51.361
This should be interesting.

12:53.263 --> 12:54.364
Hey...

12:55.698 --> 12:58.000
Ooh.

12:58.033 --> 13:00.504
Don't you fucking put your hand on me.

13:00.537 --> 13:02.072
Jesus, Sasha.

13:03.740 --> 13:05.609
Really, Dash?

13:05.642 --> 13:07.912
Let him go, Sash.

13:09.078 --> 13:11.380
Fuck.

13:11.413 --> 13:13.350
We've got business to discuss.

13:15.684 --> 13:18.621
Look, I know
I'm asking a lot.

13:21.291 --> 13:24.494
Last time, we got our
asses kicked by the Pardoner.

13:24.527 --> 13:26.330
We lost our VIP.

13:26.363 --> 13:28.498
And if you remember correctly,

13:28.530 --> 13:31.200
you almost came home
in a body-bag.

13:31.234 --> 13:33.570
Is this some sort
of revenge thing?

13:33.602 --> 13:35.104
That doesn't feel
like you, man.

13:35.138 --> 13:37.975
It's a job.
Nothing personal.

13:38.008 --> 13:41.011
Listen, I don't give a flying
fuck if you've got a score to settle.

13:41.043 --> 13:43.279
This is a shit-ton of money
we're talking about here.

13:43.312 --> 13:45.448
- That's right.
- Life-changing.

13:47.017 --> 13:48.185
I'm in.

13:52.288 --> 13:54.423
And what about you two?

13:54.456 --> 13:57.461
You know, it's
"all for one and one for all."

13:57.793 --> 14:00.396
Right?

14:00.429 --> 14:03.065
I don't know. I feel like we're
not getting the full story.

14:03.099 --> 14:05.302
And I want to know
what this Pardoner guy stole.

14:05.335 --> 14:06.737
We all do.

14:06.769 --> 14:08.739
But that ain't the job.

14:08.772 --> 14:11.375
This is strictly
VIP protection.

14:11.408 --> 14:12.743
Easy money.

14:13.375 --> 14:15.444
But why the skeleton crew?

14:15.477 --> 14:18.280
Wouldn't it make more sense
to have a presence?

14:18.313 --> 14:20.549
I'm with Fox on this one.

14:20.582 --> 14:22.151
You know,
going in with a full kit

14:22.184 --> 14:24.453
could intimidate
the city council on site.

14:24.486 --> 14:26.789
Might even look bad
for Chalmers, too.

14:26.822 --> 14:29.292
Do we have to bring
the corporate stooge?

14:29.325 --> 14:31.561
We go way back.

14:31.594 --> 14:34.398
He's good in a fight.
Trust me.

14:40.336 --> 14:41.169
All right.

14:41.203 --> 14:43.739
If you want another shot
at the Pardoner,

14:43.773 --> 14:45.642
I got your back, boss.

14:48.778 --> 14:52.749
Look, you know I'd go anywhere to
bust some skulls with you guys.

14:52.782 --> 14:56.520
But this thing ain't right.

14:56.552 --> 14:59.123
Being rushed out there,
no prep...

15:01.490 --> 15:04.260
Sasha, you can do this
if you want...

15:04.293 --> 15:07.230
- I'm out.
- Harrison, you're right,

15:07.263 --> 15:10.500
but this payday
is a game-changer.

15:10.533 --> 15:12.436
Wouldn't you want
to spend the rest of the year

15:12.469 --> 15:15.072
not getting shot at
for once?

15:15.105 --> 15:16.706
I mean, think about it.

15:17.874 --> 15:19.408
Come on.

15:19.442 --> 15:21.044
Do it for me.

15:22.245 --> 15:24.181
Fuck.

15:24.214 --> 15:25.449
There we go.

15:25.481 --> 15:28.084
See? That's what
brothers are for.

15:28.118 --> 15:29.820
To keep their sisters
out of trouble.

15:29.852 --> 15:32.423
Such a heartwarming moment.

15:33.188 --> 15:34.824
All right. Crystal!

15:34.857 --> 15:36.525
Another round of shots.

15:36.558 --> 15:38.194
Hey, Crystal, make it two.

15:38.861 --> 15:40.197
You buying?

15:40.230 --> 15:42.132
We'll send the bill
to Chapter House.

15:42.164 --> 15:43.599
I hear that.

15:43.633 --> 15:45.701
- Hoo-ha!
- Hoo-ha!

17:34.810 --> 17:36.913
What a shithole!

17:43.752 --> 17:46.889
Not loving the spot, boss.

17:46.923 --> 17:48.791
Lot of windows,

17:48.825 --> 17:50.693
lots of places to hide.

17:50.727 --> 17:53.497
Less time here,
the better.

17:54.564 --> 17:56.666
Where's our rendezvous, Fox?

17:56.699 --> 17:58.902
You said we were meeting
the building manager?

18:01.003 --> 18:02.939
Mr. Chalmers?

18:04.707 --> 18:06.243
Tell 'em.

18:07.509 --> 18:09.913
There is no building manager.

18:09.945 --> 18:12.982
There is no rendezvous.

18:13.016 --> 18:15.819
- Fuckin' knew it.
- What the hell is this about, Fox?

18:19.655 --> 18:21.357
The Pardoner.

18:22.959 --> 18:24.861
- He's coming here.
- Hold on.

18:24.894 --> 18:26.762
You knew the Pardoner
was coming

18:26.796 --> 18:28.431
and you didn't bring
the fucking cavalry?

18:28.463 --> 18:29.565
We are the cavalry.

18:29.598 --> 18:32.301
A cavalry that's outmanned
and with limited firepower.

18:33.970 --> 18:35.771
So, this was all a set-up?

18:35.805 --> 18:37.874
We did what we had to.

18:37.906 --> 18:39.842
Posing as civilians
was the only way

18:39.875 --> 18:42.311
that we could get
a team in range.

18:42.845 --> 18:44.547
This will work.

18:44.579 --> 18:47.583
If the Pardoner saw us
come with the authorities

18:47.616 --> 18:49.653
he may have pulled back.

18:49.685 --> 18:52.021
It had to be
a small security team.

18:52.055 --> 18:53.856
It had to be you, Miller.

18:58.327 --> 19:00.062
Great. No service.

19:00.096 --> 19:02.832
You guys are Chapter House,
can't you move a satellite or something?

19:02.865 --> 19:04.834
Probably just the Pardoner
jamming the signals.

19:04.866 --> 19:06.802
So we're bait.

19:06.836 --> 19:08.672
No. You're not the bait.

19:08.704 --> 19:10.406
I am.

19:52.914 --> 19:54.584
Of all people...

19:55.951 --> 19:58.422
I expected you
to understand.

20:01.423 --> 20:04.461
When this is all over, you're gonna
see why it has to be this way.

20:16.939 --> 20:18.742
You lied to me.

20:18.775 --> 20:20.610
I had no choice.

20:21.676 --> 20:22.978
I know you, Miller.

20:24.113 --> 20:27.616
All you
ex-jarheads-turned-PMCs...

20:27.650 --> 20:29.786
You're all the same.

20:29.818 --> 20:33.722
You come back stateside
and still want to live the life,

20:33.756 --> 20:36.526
but it's not about
God and country,

20:36.558 --> 20:38.494
it's about how much money
you can make.

20:39.862 --> 20:41.498
Well, you're getting paid.

20:41.530 --> 20:42.731
So do your job.

20:42.765 --> 20:46.069
You put my team in danger.

20:46.102 --> 20:48.805
They have families, lives.

20:48.837 --> 20:52.408
And you brought us here
unprepared.

20:52.442 --> 20:54.877
After everything
we've been through.

20:54.911 --> 20:59.082
Have any of you
checked your bank accounts?

20:59.115 --> 21:02.986
Half the money up-front.
Just like you wanted.

21:03.885 --> 21:06.588
We get out of this alive

21:06.622 --> 21:08.858
and you get the other half.

21:08.891 --> 21:10.960
It's not about the money.

21:10.992 --> 21:12.928
Who wants to beat
the shit out of this guy?

21:12.961 --> 21:14.631
Me. Anyone else?

21:14.663 --> 21:16.665
- Gladly.
- I'll have a piece.

21:17.467 --> 21:18.868
Come and get it.

21:18.901 --> 21:20.504
Leave him alone.

21:23.138 --> 21:26.842
It doesn't matter
how you got here.

21:26.875 --> 21:29.846
If you want to survive,
we're gonna have to work together.

21:33.148 --> 21:34.683
I just want to know why.

21:38.221 --> 21:40.623
That son of a bitch

21:40.655 --> 21:43.460
is using my daughter
to get to me.

21:46.061 --> 21:47.897
You got kids, Miller?

21:51.601 --> 21:53.470
You'd do anything for 'em.

21:53.736 --> 21:54.838
Right?

21:57.906 --> 22:00.109
Right now,
my baby's in trouble.

22:08.984 --> 22:10.619
We got a fight
coming to us.

22:13.788 --> 22:15.825
And Harrison's right.

22:15.857 --> 22:18.494
We're outmanned, outgunned.

22:20.128 --> 22:22.164
But the fight's still coming...

22:24.666 --> 22:26.735
whether we like it or not.

22:29.271 --> 22:30.740
Let's get you someplace safe.

23:12.048 --> 23:13.250
This'll do.

23:16.751 --> 23:18.153
Still know how to use this?

23:19.855 --> 23:21.290
Don't worry about me, soldier.

23:22.825 --> 23:25.327
Just go get my little girl,
all right?

23:25.361 --> 23:28.631
No matter what happens,
don't open this door.

23:28.663 --> 23:31.099
Miller, please.

23:31.133 --> 23:33.937
We'll get your daughter.
I promise.

23:33.970 --> 23:36.038
I know you will, Miller.

23:50.619 --> 23:52.655
Anything happens
to my team,

23:53.288 --> 23:55.592
I'm coming after you.

23:57.660 --> 23:59.663
Wouldn't have it any other way.

24:05.034 --> 24:06.570
Let's move.

26:07.455 --> 26:09.358
Time to shake off
the rust, buddy.

26:25.240 --> 26:26.275
Come in.

26:26.307 --> 26:27.309
Come in.

26:30.311 --> 26:32.347
We've lost connection
with our scouts.

26:32.381 --> 26:34.750
Apparently, Chalmers and his
friends are more resourceful

26:34.784 --> 26:35.785
than we thought.

26:47.863 --> 26:49.265
Time for a new strategy.

26:50.932 --> 26:52.067
I hope you're ready.

26:55.069 --> 26:56.172
We're moving.

27:05.480 --> 27:07.150
Eyes on how many?

27:07.182 --> 27:09.519
Hard to say.
I count ten.

27:09.551 --> 27:12.121
Maybe more.
Too much cover out there.

27:14.123 --> 27:17.794
Layered attacks.
They'll come in waves.

27:17.826 --> 27:20.163
They'll save the big attack
for when we get desperate.

27:21.430 --> 27:25.000
You know...
I hate to say, I told you so.

27:25.034 --> 27:28.772
A check that big and that fast,
there's always strings attached.

27:30.873 --> 27:32.408
I let my friendship with Fox
get the better of me.

27:33.509 --> 27:36.211
You know what? Fuck 'em.

27:36.244 --> 27:37.879
Money already hit our
bank accounts.

27:37.913 --> 27:40.583
Let's just make a run for it.
Let Fox and his boss

27:40.615 --> 27:41.817
- fend for themselves.
- No.

27:42.351 --> 27:44.387
No.

27:44.420 --> 27:47.557
But I'm not doing this
for Fox or Chalmers.

27:49.458 --> 27:51.093
It's hard to look
a man in the eye

27:52.124 --> 27:53.128
who asks for help to save
his family and tell him no.

27:55.364 --> 27:58.067
Besides, we don't run
from fights.

28:00.201 --> 28:02.172
Hooo-rah.

28:09.944 --> 28:11.079
That must be Eva.

28:11.413 --> 28:12.414
Come on.

28:22.324 --> 28:23.426
It's Eva.

28:23.459 --> 28:24.560
We've gotta get her now.

28:24.593 --> 28:25.494
Hey, hey.
Look...

28:25.528 --> 28:27.230
Give me some cover
fire and I'll grab her.

28:27.262 --> 28:28.364
Slow down.

28:28.397 --> 28:31.634
The Pardoner is smart.
That's exactly what he wants.

28:31.666 --> 28:34.169
So, what, we're just gonna
let her stand there?

28:37.071 --> 28:38.073
No.

29:21.349 --> 29:24.019
Eva, are you okay?

29:28.523 --> 29:30.025
Who are you?

29:30.058 --> 29:31.326
Nicholas Fox.

29:33.095 --> 29:34.264
I'm sorry.

29:37.365 --> 29:40.135
I didn't mean for any
of this to happen.

29:40.169 --> 29:42.105
I just wanted to test
it in the field.

29:45.140 --> 29:46.276
What's she talking about?

29:49.310 --> 29:51.346
Look, none of that
matters right now. Okay.

29:51.380 --> 29:53.583
We've all come to
bring you home.

29:58.287 --> 29:59.989
My dad isn't here, is he?

30:03.092 --> 30:05.595
Please tell me that
my dad isn't here.

30:21.009 --> 30:22.711
It was the only
way to get you.

30:25.513 --> 30:26.515
Me?

30:28.750 --> 30:31.019
Or Project 725?

30:36.724 --> 30:38.193
Enough!

31:00.715 --> 31:02.317
Nice to see you again, Miller.

31:02.351 --> 31:03.519
How's the back?

31:13.729 --> 31:15.097
Seven pounds.

31:18.267 --> 31:21.504
That's the amount of pressure
required to pull a trigger.

31:21.537 --> 31:23.506
Just like that.

31:23.905 --> 31:25.340
It's all over.

31:26.174 --> 31:28.344
Look, you leave her
out of this, okay?

31:28.376 --> 31:30.245
If you want Chalmers, you
come and get him, bitch.

31:32.681 --> 31:33.783
In due time.

31:35.851 --> 31:39.555
My men fight for a cause,
for a purpose.

31:40.689 --> 31:42.325
For a New World Order.

31:44.425 --> 31:46.428
We know what's at stake.

31:48.329 --> 31:50.665
Do you?

31:50.699 --> 31:53.469
When your men learn the truth,
will they stay by your side?

31:56.637 --> 31:58.106
Will you stay, Derek?

31:59.607 --> 32:01.277
And what truth is that?

32:01.309 --> 32:02.744
That you're a psychopath?

32:09.852 --> 32:12.588
This facility is a security
nightmare.

32:14.288 --> 32:15.424
Lots of ways in.

32:16.357 --> 32:17.793
Hard to protect.

32:18.826 --> 32:20.229
Just remember.

32:23.499 --> 32:27.069
We have all the weaponry,
all the manpower.

32:28.436 --> 32:30.305
And all the leverage.

32:30.338 --> 32:32.575
Now, I'm giving you one hour
to bring me Chalmers

32:32.607 --> 32:37.378
and the code to Project 725,
or it's going to get messy.

32:37.412 --> 32:38.548
No, hey!

32:39.548 --> 32:40.583
Not now.

32:52.728 --> 32:54.330
I'll see you soon, Miller.

33:06.674 --> 33:09.244
Did you find her? Is she okay?

33:09.278 --> 33:10.880
She's alive. For now.

33:12.280 --> 33:13.582
What's Project 725?

33:18.753 --> 33:19.988
Tell me.

33:20.021 --> 33:23.224
Look I told both of you, that
if I was gonna take this job,

33:23.258 --> 33:24.425
I needed to know everything.

33:24.459 --> 33:26.695
And all I keep hearing
is lie after lie.

33:26.728 --> 33:28.631
Tell me what
the fuck's going on.

33:30.365 --> 33:33.469
Project 725 is an artificial
intelligence system.

33:35.304 --> 33:36.839
Not just an A.I. system.

33:37.940 --> 33:38.941
It's a quantum A.I.

33:38.974 --> 33:42.377
Wait, you cracked a two-state
quantum system?

33:42.411 --> 33:44.547
How about we cut the geek-speak.

33:44.579 --> 33:46.714
It's binary on steroids.

33:46.748 --> 33:48.617
What? I subscribe to
TechCrunch.

33:49.285 --> 33:50.620
It was my daughter's project.

33:52.621 --> 33:54.357
<i>Fresh out of MIT.</i>

33:58.559 --> 34:01.429
And she built something
way beyond me.

34:02.297 --> 34:04.432
And then she stole it.

34:04.967 --> 34:06.235
Eva...

34:07.635 --> 34:09.237
Eva was confused.

34:10.472 --> 34:12.341
Angry about a lot of things.

34:13.909 --> 34:17.246
She's just got too
much of me in her.

34:17.277 --> 34:20.215
So you tried to take the A.I.
from her, but instead

34:20.248 --> 34:21.951
she brought it to the Pardoner.

34:24.585 --> 34:25.687
The board.

34:25.721 --> 34:27.657
They just saw the
project differently.

34:28.422 --> 34:29.424
Very differently.

34:32.360 --> 34:33.496
And here we are.

34:34.996 --> 34:36.199
Yeah.

34:37.431 --> 34:38.567
Here we are.

34:54.449 --> 34:56.585
I know you're upset.

34:58.320 --> 35:02.291
You came to me for help.

35:02.324 --> 35:04.559
You wanted me to help
you change the world.

35:06.394 --> 35:07.463
That's what I'm doing.

35:08.963 --> 35:11.366
I reached out to you
because I wanted to test

35:11.400 --> 35:12.902
Project 725 in the field.

35:15.369 --> 35:17.038
To prove that it worked.

35:17.072 --> 35:19.807
To prove that it would
help people.

35:19.840 --> 35:21.876
And you promised me that.

35:23.878 --> 35:24.980
And you lied.

35:31.052 --> 35:34.257
That is exactly what I'm doing.

35:36.324 --> 35:38.994
We are fighting
for the same cause.

35:41.563 --> 35:44.532
Why do you not see that?

35:46.001 --> 35:48.704
You wanna use your technology
to fix society.

35:49.804 --> 35:52.040
To fix what is already sick.

35:53.809 --> 35:56.478
We have the opportunity to make
real change, but in order

35:56.510 --> 35:58.813
to find a cure for the sickness,
we have to know the cause.

36:00.614 --> 36:03.318
Greed is the root of all pain.

36:04.985 --> 36:08.590
Of all suffering,
of all evil.

36:10.958 --> 36:13.061
Pharmaceutical companies enhance
their drugs to become

36:13.094 --> 36:14.962
more addictive.

36:14.996 --> 36:17.900
Politicians are lining their
pockets while homeless people

36:17.932 --> 36:19.335
flood the streets.

36:21.503 --> 36:24.440
I am not the bad guy.

36:24.472 --> 36:26.608
I am a saint

36:26.641 --> 36:31.713
compared to the pain and misery
they cause every second,

36:31.746 --> 36:35.050
of every minute of every day.

36:36.784 --> 36:39.654
You wanna find a cure for this
sickness, I am telling you

36:39.688 --> 36:41.090
what it is.

36:41.123 --> 36:43.759
With the code from Chalmers,
we can burn it.

36:45.659 --> 36:48.630
Burn it all to the ground.

36:58.873 --> 37:01.042
Aren't you tired
of being a pawn?

37:06.782 --> 37:08.918
Time's up. Send them in.

37:21.929 --> 37:24.866
Courtesy of our recently
deceased friends.

37:24.900 --> 37:25.901
Nice.

37:31.005 --> 37:33.608
Even with the extra guns
and ammo,

37:33.641 --> 37:35.810
it's gonna be a tough fight.

37:35.844 --> 37:38.981
And the sun's
going down fast,

37:39.014 --> 37:41.483
so they'll be knocking on our
door before we know it.

37:42.851 --> 37:44.619
Derek.

37:44.652 --> 37:46.855
It's okay, we got it.

37:47.922 --> 37:49.724
This isn't your fault.

37:49.757 --> 37:51.826
Yeah, I'm not so sure
about that.

37:51.860 --> 37:53.896
I talked you all into this.

37:53.929 --> 37:56.697
Actually, I'm pretty sure it was
the gold-covered carrot

37:56.731 --> 37:57.766
they dangled.

37:57.798 --> 37:59.402
Which you all agreed on.

38:01.902 --> 38:04.906
Guys, we all decided
to come, remember?

38:04.940 --> 38:07.143
Look, still got your back, boss.

38:13.014 --> 38:16.652
Well, if we're gonna survive,
we gotta be nimble.

38:16.684 --> 38:19.487
Use the location to our
advantage.

38:19.521 --> 38:22.191
We'll never make it through the
night if we take them head-on.

38:25.126 --> 38:26.562
Let's do this.

38:57.659 --> 38:58.927
Where do you think
you're going, pal?

39:59.019 --> 40:00.054
Let's go.

40:03.824 --> 40:05.793
Come on, you sons of bitches.

40:06.860 --> 40:07.862
Go.

41:08.856 --> 41:10.960
Side and main entrances
are compromised.

41:14.929 --> 41:16.932
Are you sure about this plan?

41:17.898 --> 41:19.101
Are you doubting the cause?

41:20.168 --> 41:21.971
No, it's just...

41:24.005 --> 41:26.273
We're losing good men.

41:26.306 --> 41:30.645
I feel their pain, but you know
what's at stake here.

41:33.148 --> 41:35.617
Their sacrifices won't
be forgotten.

41:37.351 --> 41:38.686
Trust me.

41:40.688 --> 41:42.190
Take a few men and go
around the side entrance.

41:42.222 --> 41:43.891
Signal when you're inside.

41:43.925 --> 41:45.127
Copy that.

41:45.159 --> 41:46.394
B team, let's roll out.

42:02.143 --> 42:04.913
We're here, back entrance
of the sub-basement.

42:07.081 --> 42:08.083
Let's go.

42:38.246 --> 42:40.081
Time's up, Miller.

42:40.114 --> 42:41.716
Where's Chalmers?

42:44.952 --> 42:46.721
Hold your fire, or she dies.

42:55.362 --> 42:57.432
How much is Chalmers
paying you, Miller?

43:00.268 --> 43:02.036
How much is enough?

43:04.038 --> 43:06.775
You're out here putting
your life on the line.

43:08.409 --> 43:10.945
Your team's lives
on the line.

43:13.815 --> 43:14.849
And for what?

43:16.885 --> 43:18.020
Money?

43:18.853 --> 43:21.255
More money.

43:21.289 --> 43:26.161
You are sheep.
You are slaves to a machine.

43:29.030 --> 43:31.767
You're slaves to those
who run it all

43:31.800 --> 43:34.936
for their mass profits,
while you cling to the pennies

43:34.969 --> 43:36.771
that fall from their pockets.

43:45.413 --> 43:46.782
I'm gonna make you
an offer, Miller.

43:48.949 --> 43:51.419
Just put your weapons down
and fight with me.

43:54.956 --> 43:58.059
You can have a seat at the table
and fight for something

43:58.092 --> 43:59.360
that actually matters.

44:14.943 --> 44:16.411
Fox!

44:16.443 --> 44:18.112
Tear this place apart.

44:49.610 --> 44:50.945
Fox.

45:56.143 --> 45:57.979
Sasha, get down.

45:59.280 --> 46:02.083
Listen to me. He wouldn't
want you dead either.

46:02.115 --> 46:03.518
Let's go.
Come on.

46:10.023 --> 46:11.460
Eva?

46:41.489 --> 46:43.191
He's still alive!
Cover me!

47:43.251 --> 47:44.252
Over there!

47:44.751 --> 47:46.087
Eva, get down.

47:54.594 --> 47:55.997
Hang in there, big guy.

47:56.496 --> 47:57.765
Come on.

47:58.833 --> 48:00.434
Over there.

48:07.708 --> 48:09.711
What the hell
were you thinking?

48:10.777 --> 48:12.013
I wasn't.

48:13.280 --> 48:15.150
Hey.

48:15.182 --> 48:17.351
Tell Maggie I'm sorry.

48:18.219 --> 48:20.688
I just tried to get it in
one more time.

48:20.721 --> 48:22.556
But I guess she was right.

48:24.291 --> 48:26.427
I should have stayed my
ass behind the bench.

48:26.460 --> 48:29.196
Hold it. Put pressure on it.
Come on.

48:34.668 --> 48:38.039
Don't let that terrorist son of
a bitch find Chalmers.

48:39.440 --> 48:43.110
You can't let him
start Project 725.

48:44.811 --> 48:46.713
Promise me.

48:46.746 --> 48:48.115
Miller.

48:48.148 --> 48:49.116
Miller.

48:49.150 --> 48:51.385
Boss, we gotta go,
it's getting hot out there.

48:51.418 --> 48:53.054
Let's go.
Come on.

48:56.257 --> 48:59.159
Fuck him. Let the bastard die.

48:59.193 --> 49:01.296
He got Harrison killed.

49:01.329 --> 49:03.398
If he hadn't lied to us
and manipulated you,

49:04.798 --> 49:07.201
my brother
would still be alive.

49:07.235 --> 49:09.204
That asshole got exactly
what he deserved.

49:10.304 --> 49:11.840
Sasha.

49:14.407 --> 49:15.509
Don't.

49:19.413 --> 49:21.583
That's my brother's
dead body out there.

49:22.315 --> 49:23.484
Mine.

49:27.788 --> 49:29.557
You told me to trust you.

49:31.324 --> 49:32.259
Harrison knew.

49:32.293 --> 49:34.896
He knew this job was wrong
from the start.

49:34.929 --> 49:36.664
And I talked him into it.

49:38.666 --> 49:40.802
We all have his blood
on our hands now.

49:43.371 --> 49:44.873
Especially you.

49:46.606 --> 49:48.742
Hey... Hey,
where do you think you're going?

49:48.775 --> 49:51.211
I'm not leaving him out there
for those animals.

49:51.244 --> 49:52.346
That's suicide.

49:52.380 --> 49:55.416
Listen, I would give you time,
but we don't have any.

49:56.650 --> 49:57.786
Please.

50:05.626 --> 50:06.628
Fine.

50:07.427 --> 50:08.630
What's our next move?

50:12.365 --> 50:13.668
Stay here.

50:13.701 --> 50:14.836
I'm gonna go find Eva.

50:48.802 --> 50:50.404
I can't believe this.

50:54.541 --> 50:55.677
We'll be okay.

50:56.844 --> 50:57.846
No.

51:01.949 --> 51:03.918
Dad, what don't you get
right now?

51:03.951 --> 51:06.188
I mean, this is my fault.

51:09.523 --> 51:10.825
It's my fault.

51:12.659 --> 51:14.862
You should've come to me
first, Eva.

51:16.797 --> 51:19.300
I wanted to but I didn't
know what you would say.

51:21.802 --> 51:23.637
You've never trusted me.

51:29.577 --> 51:31.512
Sometimes I feel like
you loved your company

51:31.545 --> 51:33.315
more than you loved
anything else.

51:35.782 --> 51:37.351
If you ever thought that,

51:38.485 --> 51:39.753
I'm sorry.

51:48.396 --> 51:49.397
Well,

51:50.864 --> 51:52.733
if we make it out of here,

51:54.367 --> 51:55.402
I want you to tell me

51:55.436 --> 51:56.871
why you still have
that ring on.

51:58.438 --> 51:59.540
To remember.

52:03.943 --> 52:06.780
Mom left you
a really long time ago, Dad.

52:09.317 --> 52:10.885
Mistakes...

52:11.719 --> 52:13.421
Really, lots of...

52:14.722 --> 52:16.557
Many mistakes.

52:18.726 --> 52:20.595
I can't let myself forget.

52:24.331 --> 52:27.034
I guess we both have a hard
time letting things go.

52:29.103 --> 52:32.440
Well, like father,
like daughter.

52:36.344 --> 52:37.378
What was that?

52:45.485 --> 52:46.920
- Get in.
- Are you serious?

52:46.954 --> 52:49.457
Get in, yes.
Just trust me.

52:49.489 --> 52:51.558
- Are you not coming?
- No, they need me.

52:51.592 --> 52:52.727
Go, now.

52:53.427 --> 52:54.429
Be careful.

53:01.902 --> 53:02.971
Drop it, Chalmers.

53:09.143 --> 53:10.612
If you kill me...

53:11.746 --> 53:15.784
Project 725 is dead.

53:20.054 --> 53:21.056
You're right.

53:31.664 --> 53:34.000
I can't kill you.

53:34.034 --> 53:36.070
That is gonna pale
in comparison

53:36.103 --> 53:37.405
to what I do to you

53:37.438 --> 53:39.340
if you don't give me
the code.

53:46.547 --> 53:47.615
Pick him up.

54:25.018 --> 54:26.486
Halt!

54:55.583 --> 54:56.684
Still not talking?

54:58.686 --> 54:59.687
It's all right.

55:00.586 --> 55:03.490
Not quite finished
setting up yet, anyways.

55:08.161 --> 55:10.163
Look Donovan...

55:10.197 --> 55:11.699
Do you mind
if I call you Donovan?

55:15.635 --> 55:17.237
You and I both know there's
nothing I can do to you

55:17.271 --> 55:19.073
to make you
give me that code.

55:20.641 --> 55:21.943
The more time you wait,

55:23.210 --> 55:25.179
the more time I have
to find Eva.

55:26.847 --> 55:28.450
And when I do,

55:29.884 --> 55:32.119
I'm going to torture her.

55:32.152 --> 55:36.124
And I'm going to make you
watch the entire thing.

55:39.693 --> 55:42.497
You'll beg me
to use Project 725

55:42.530 --> 55:44.131
by the time
I'm done with her.

55:44.164 --> 55:45.700
I can promise you that.

55:50.603 --> 55:52.506
You wanna torture somebody?

55:52.972 --> 55:54.541
Torture me.

55:55.543 --> 55:56.911
You leave her out of this.

56:27.807 --> 56:28.842
Fuck this.

56:58.838 --> 56:59.907
Over here.

57:24.898 --> 57:27.035
Come on.
We're needed at base camp.

58:08.007 --> 58:09.109
Oh...

58:11.811 --> 58:13.748
Eyes on Dr. Chalmers.
North hallway.

58:17.384 --> 58:19.786
<i>We're closing in on her now.</i>

58:19.820 --> 58:22.256
Oh, it looks like
our guests are arriving early.

58:25.125 --> 58:27.961
Don't underestimate
my daughter.

58:27.994 --> 58:29.829
She's full of surprises.

58:47.414 --> 58:49.050
Shh!

58:49.083 --> 58:50.684
I'm not one of them.

58:52.786 --> 58:54.822
Derek Miller.

58:54.855 --> 58:57.992
- You're Fox's friend?
- That's right.

58:58.025 --> 59:00.360
- I'm sorry.
- No time for apologies.

59:00.393 --> 59:02.128
We gotta move.
All right?

59:02.161 --> 59:03.163
- Okay.
- Come on.

59:12.438 --> 59:14.375
<i>Sir, we lost her.
She just vanished.</i>

59:16.043 --> 59:19.713
Please explain to me
how you lost her.

59:19.746 --> 59:23.116
I keep saying, good help
ain't easy to find.

59:25.018 --> 59:27.021
Are you hacked
into the cameras yet?

59:27.054 --> 59:28.021
Almost.

59:28.054 --> 59:30.023
Bringing up the live feed.

59:36.063 --> 59:38.365
Wait a second.
She's... She's gone.

59:40.099 --> 59:42.202
Explain to me
how that is possible.

59:43.036 --> 59:44.438
I don't know.

59:44.471 --> 59:46.474
It's like she just vanished
into thin air.

59:46.907 --> 59:47.740
She vanished...

59:47.775 --> 59:50.077
Find her!

59:51.411 --> 59:53.447
And get me a new walkie.

59:58.050 --> 59:59.886
No, no, whoa!
Hey, it's me.

01:00:03.389 --> 01:00:04.725
Eva.

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:07.894
Tell 'em what you told me.

01:00:12.065 --> 01:00:13.967
The Pardoner
has my father.

01:00:19.239 --> 01:00:21.409
My dad
is one of the strongest,

01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:25.012
most hard-willed men
that I've ever met.

01:00:27.914 --> 01:00:31.284
But these last few days,
I've seen how dangerous the Pardoner is

01:00:31.318 --> 01:00:34.255
and I've seen just how badly
he wants the access codes

01:00:34.288 --> 01:00:35.956
to Project 725.

01:00:38.125 --> 01:00:39.893
Please...

01:00:39.927 --> 01:00:42.296
I don't know how much longer
my dad can hold off.

01:00:43.831 --> 01:00:46.500
We can't let the Pardoner
control Project 725.

01:00:46.532 --> 01:00:48.201
- We just can't.
- Why?

01:00:48.235 --> 01:00:51.038
What's so fuckin' special
about this computer anyways?

01:00:51.605 --> 01:00:54.541
When we created it,

01:00:54.574 --> 01:00:57.811
I wanted to use it to
revolutionize the way that we live.

01:00:57.844 --> 01:01:00.013
To help our government
run more efficiently,

01:01:01.215 --> 01:01:04.084
our economy,
every aspect of society.

01:01:04.117 --> 01:01:06.287
And it is more than capable
of doing those things.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.989
I know that it can.

01:01:09.155 --> 01:01:10.924
I tried to convince the board

01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:12.960
to give me the funds
for a trial run.

01:01:12.992 --> 01:01:15.862
My dad even backed me up.
They voted him down.

01:01:15.896 --> 01:01:18.032
All they kept thinking about
was the money they could make

01:01:18.065 --> 01:01:20.367
to flip it to the military.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.135
They wanted to turn it
into a weapon.

01:01:22.568 --> 01:01:24.271
Exactly.

01:01:24.304 --> 01:01:25.506
I couldn't let them do that,

01:01:25.539 --> 01:01:26.574
not after how hard
I'd worked

01:01:26.606 --> 01:01:28.074
to bring about
something good.

01:01:28.876 --> 01:01:30.411
I just kept thinking

01:01:30.443 --> 01:01:32.179
if I could show them
the data,

01:01:32.211 --> 01:01:35.115
if they could see it,
then they would understand.

01:01:37.617 --> 01:01:39.219
Did you ever test it
in the field?

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.954
Once.

01:01:41.954 --> 01:01:43.257
Flight 314.

01:01:45.559 --> 01:01:47.428
The Pardoner
triggered the crash remotely

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:50.029
and got a taste
of its power.

01:01:50.063 --> 01:01:52.398
Luckily, I was able to
stop him from going further

01:01:52.431 --> 01:01:55.134
by initiating the fail-safe.

01:01:55.168 --> 01:01:57.238
And what else does the
Pardoner want to do with it?

01:01:59.172 --> 01:02:02.041
I wanted to save the world
with Project 725.

01:02:02.074 --> 01:02:04.311
He wants to use it
to burn it to the ground.

01:02:05.512 --> 01:02:07.181
What do you mean?

01:02:07.213 --> 01:02:10.918
She means that he plans
on using the program

01:02:10.951 --> 01:02:13.052
to wipe out everything.

01:02:13.085 --> 01:02:16.590
Financial records, bank
statements, communications...

01:02:18.324 --> 01:02:19.960
Jesus.

01:02:19.992 --> 01:02:22.128
It would send us back
to the Stone Ages.

01:02:22.161 --> 01:02:23.163
Exactly.

01:02:23.898 --> 01:02:25.332
You see,
the Pardoner believes

01:02:25.364 --> 01:02:27.367
that if he resets
everything to zero,

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.469
that that's the only way
that it will save society.

01:02:29.503 --> 01:02:32.472
Wipe everything out,
start with a clean slate.

01:02:32.505 --> 01:02:33.907
Unbelievable.

01:02:36.409 --> 01:02:38.678
And the Pardoner
can do all this?

01:02:38.711 --> 01:02:40.614
If your dad gives him
the fail-safe?

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:47.021
I've made a terrible mistake
and I realize that now.

01:02:47.054 --> 01:02:50.023
This is a power
humanity is not ready for.

01:02:50.056 --> 01:02:51.424
We're the only ones
that can stop him.

01:02:51.458 --> 01:02:55.096
So I am begging you,
please help me.

01:03:06.106 --> 01:03:07.608
It's been a long time
since we fought

01:03:07.641 --> 01:03:09.309
for something
other than a payday.

01:03:11.744 --> 01:03:14.181
But maybe that's why
we're here now.

01:03:14.213 --> 01:03:16.384
Maybe that's why
all this shit happened.

01:03:17.284 --> 01:03:18.385
This.

01:03:20.152 --> 01:03:21.922
This is something
worth fighting for.

01:03:28.661 --> 01:03:30.364
My brother died today.

01:03:32.365 --> 01:03:34.233
This...

01:03:34.266 --> 01:03:36.636
This is the fight
that Harrison would want.

01:03:40.606 --> 01:03:42.375
He'd wanna stop
the Pardoner.

01:03:45.644 --> 01:03:47.146
And that's what
I'm gonna do.

01:03:47.179 --> 01:03:49.750
I'm all in, boss.
I'll do whatever it takes

01:03:49.782 --> 01:03:51.451
to make that happen.

01:03:54.653 --> 01:03:55.989
Dash?

01:04:09.402 --> 01:04:11.071
How do you want
to play it, boss?

01:04:13.172 --> 01:04:15.175
I know that you guys
are the experts,

01:04:16.043 --> 01:04:17.211
but I have an idea.

01:04:25.351 --> 01:04:27.153
When did you see
the schematics?

01:04:27.186 --> 01:04:29.155
The Pardoner had blueprints.

01:04:29.188 --> 01:04:30.490
He's been casing
this place for days

01:04:30.523 --> 01:04:32.159
waiting for my dad.

01:04:32.192 --> 01:04:34.494
So, you're drawing this
all based on memory?

01:04:34.527 --> 01:04:35.528
It's a little crude

01:04:35.563 --> 01:04:38.032
but it should give us
a good idea of the space.

01:04:38.065 --> 01:04:39.700
The control room.

01:04:39.733 --> 01:04:43.237
This is where the main power
to the building runs from.

01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:45.271
Hard to run a computer
if we cut the power.

01:04:46.572 --> 01:04:47.708
You think it will work?

01:04:48.708 --> 01:04:49.777
It has to.

01:05:25.144 --> 01:05:26.579
Clear!

01:05:26.612 --> 01:05:28.348
Fan out! Eyes open!

01:05:32.853 --> 01:05:34.188
Miller, hold there!

01:05:51.237 --> 01:05:52.405
The control room's that way.

01:05:53.639 --> 01:05:55.375
Okay, let's go. Move.

01:05:58.677 --> 01:05:59.746
I see another one.

01:06:02.681 --> 01:06:03.683
Shit!

01:06:21.835 --> 01:06:23.537
<i>Derek Miller.</i>

01:06:25.572 --> 01:06:27.675
<i>Your resolve is impressive.</i>

01:06:28.909 --> 01:06:31.412
<i>You truly do not know
when to quit.</i>

01:06:35.382 --> 01:06:36.550
It's admirable.

01:06:38.717 --> 01:06:39.786
Stupid...

01:06:41.521 --> 01:06:42.623
But admirable.

01:06:44.257 --> 01:06:45.458
<i>But did you really think</i>

01:06:45.492 --> 01:06:47.795
<i>we wouldn't notice the
security cameras going out?</i>

01:06:50.597 --> 01:06:53.801
Look, I'm assuming
Dr. Chalmers is with you.

01:06:54.867 --> 01:06:56.136
<i>That's good.</i>

01:06:57.536 --> 01:06:59.239
<i>My guards
are moving into position</i>

01:06:59.271 --> 01:07:00.873
<i>so I'm gonna make you
a limited-time offer.</i>

01:07:00.907 --> 01:07:03.410
Hand her over to me
and you live.

01:07:03.443 --> 01:07:04.478
You get to walk out.

01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:07.213
You and your team, go on,
do whatever you wanna do.

01:07:10.483 --> 01:07:11.585
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

01:07:12.552 --> 01:07:14.320
We gotta get off
his radar.

01:07:14.353 --> 01:07:15.588
Any suggestions?

01:07:17.724 --> 01:07:18.926
Yeah.

01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:25.266
This way's clear.
They must've gone down there.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.309
All clear.

01:07:37.409 --> 01:07:39.212
Not too bad, Miller.

01:07:46.286 --> 01:07:47.288
Got it?

01:07:56.463 --> 01:07:58.465
Dash, Eva, you're up.

01:08:00.934 --> 01:08:03.537
This is one complex
and out-of-date grid.

01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:04.672
Yeah, it is.

01:08:06.572 --> 01:08:08.841
<i>All units,
converge on the generator room.</i>

01:08:16.983 --> 01:08:18.551
Any time now.

01:08:18.585 --> 01:08:20.421
Try not to get
electrocuted, boss.

01:08:25.692 --> 01:08:28.395
<i>My
patience is wearing thin, Miller.</i>

01:08:29.761 --> 01:08:31.765
Just pull it.

01:08:31.796 --> 01:08:34.300
<i>My offer to
let you live is officially revoked.</i>

01:08:34.332 --> 01:08:35.568
- Come on, Dash.
- Just pull it.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.903
Come on, they're coming.
Let's go!

01:08:37.935 --> 01:08:39.238
Fuck it.

01:08:52.685 --> 01:08:54.453
Well... Fuck.

01:08:57.657 --> 01:08:58.658
All right.

01:09:00.694 --> 01:09:01.694
What happened?

01:09:05.596 --> 01:09:06.867
We lost all power.

01:09:37.997 --> 01:09:39.767
<i>Come out, you're surrounded!</i>

01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:17.871
Is something funny?

01:10:19.939 --> 01:10:20.941
Can't figure it out?

01:10:24.010 --> 01:10:25.945
Yeah.

01:10:25.979 --> 01:10:29.983
It's gonna be, you know, pretty hard
to launch your little toy there.

01:10:30.949 --> 01:10:33.420
Bring me the back-up
generator from camp.

01:10:33.453 --> 01:10:34.588
Yes, sir.

01:10:35.622 --> 01:10:36.623
On second thought...

01:10:38.091 --> 01:10:39.093
I'm coming with you.

01:10:41.795 --> 01:10:43.396
No more mistakes.

01:10:58.877 --> 01:11:00.012
Okay, this is it.

01:11:00.046 --> 01:11:02.582
We make our move while they're
distracted by the power.

01:11:02.614 --> 01:11:04.751
- We nab Chalmers and get the hell out of here.
- Yeah.

01:11:04.783 --> 01:11:06.619
But what about Project 725?

01:11:06.653 --> 01:11:07.954
We leave it
with the bad guys?

01:11:07.987 --> 01:11:09.756
They'll still be
coming after Chalmers.

01:11:09.788 --> 01:11:11.524
I think I know
what to do about that.

01:11:11.557 --> 01:11:13.493
Let's take it.
Sell it on the black market.

01:11:13.525 --> 01:11:14.595
You can't do that.

01:11:15.494 --> 01:11:16.595
Dash!

01:11:16.628 --> 01:11:18.431
What the hell
are you doing?

01:11:21.167 --> 01:11:22.702
Dash...

01:11:22.734 --> 01:11:24.670
Money's not gonna bring
Harrison back.

01:11:24.703 --> 01:11:26.907
No, but it won't hurt, either.

01:11:26.939 --> 01:11:28.442
Call it hazard pay.

01:11:29.007 --> 01:11:30.042
Dash, come on.

01:11:30.076 --> 01:11:31.612
I can't let you
do this, man.

01:11:33.779 --> 01:11:34.847
I'm sorry, Miller.

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.050
I gotta do this by myself.

01:11:37.082 --> 01:11:38.085
Don't do this.

01:11:38.851 --> 01:11:40.153
Dash, no!

01:11:41.253 --> 01:11:43.122
- Dash?
- Dash!

01:11:44.690 --> 01:11:45.792
Come on.

01:11:47.193 --> 01:11:48.228
Dash!

01:11:48.261 --> 01:11:49.463
Dash!

01:11:50.563 --> 01:11:51.565
Dash!

01:11:52.832 --> 01:11:54.734
Oh, shit! Take cover!

01:12:37.844 --> 01:12:38.878
I don't know why you think

01:12:38.912 --> 01:12:40.180
this is gonna end
any differently

01:12:40.212 --> 01:12:41.814
than the last time
we met, Miller.

01:12:43.115 --> 01:12:45.085
It's time for Eva
to go see Daddy

01:12:45.118 --> 01:12:46.553
so he can give me the code.

01:12:50.256 --> 01:12:51.859
Hold your fire.

01:12:56.662 --> 01:12:57.830
I got what you want.

01:13:00.966 --> 01:13:02.869
The money for the girl.

01:13:04.103 --> 01:13:05.105
We got a deal?

01:13:06.072 --> 01:13:07.707
Smart move, soldier.

01:13:07.739 --> 01:13:08.742
Hand her over.

01:13:14.012 --> 01:13:15.782
- We have a deal?
- Yeah, we got a deal.

01:13:16.983 --> 01:13:17.985
Kill him. Go.

01:13:35.734 --> 01:13:36.936
Cover me!

01:14:06.798 --> 01:14:09.301
No! Dash.

01:14:09.335 --> 01:14:10.938
- I'm not ready to die. Sash...
- Goddammit!

01:14:31.356 --> 01:14:32.658
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:14:33.292 --> 01:14:34.761
You're hit.

01:14:34.793 --> 01:14:36.596
Come on, we got to move! Now!

01:14:52.744 --> 01:14:54.014
Some rescue, huh?

01:14:55.881 --> 01:14:57.083
I told you to run.

01:14:59.318 --> 01:15:01.121
You should know by now
I don't listen to you.

01:15:13.065 --> 01:15:14.701
I told you
I'd find her, Chalmers.

01:15:18.337 --> 01:15:20.273
Do you know why they
call me the Pardoner?

01:15:24.109 --> 01:15:25.112
Anyone?

01:15:26.078 --> 01:15:28.847
<i>The Canterbury Tales.</i>

01:15:28.881 --> 01:15:31.718
Two Ivy League diplomas and no
one knows <i>The Pardoner's Tale.</i>

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.255
Once upon a time,

01:15:35.854 --> 01:15:36.755
three men,

01:15:36.789 --> 01:15:39.391
distraught over the death
of their friend,

01:15:39.425 --> 01:15:41.360
form a pact
of brotherhood.

01:15:41.394 --> 01:15:43.430
To seek out
and kill death.

01:15:44.463 --> 01:15:45.832
A wise man tells them

01:15:45.864 --> 01:15:47.701
death can be found
under the oak tree

01:15:47.734 --> 01:15:48.835
in the grove.

01:15:49.902 --> 01:15:50.971
When they arrive,

01:15:51.871 --> 01:15:52.873
all they find...

01:15:53.405 --> 01:15:54.740
is a pile of gold.

01:15:57.443 --> 01:15:58.744
Two of the men

01:15:59.912 --> 01:16:01.748
greedily kill the third

01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:03.850
so they could split the
treasure between themselves.

01:16:05.851 --> 01:16:07.186
Unfortunately,

01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:08.789
after they kill
their friend,

01:16:10.823 --> 01:16:12.325
they drink the wine
he'd poisoned

01:16:13.792 --> 01:16:15.161
and they both die.

01:16:17.063 --> 01:16:18.297
Some pact of brotherhood.

01:16:21.266 --> 01:16:23.269
I'm just the wise man

01:16:23.301 --> 01:16:24.904
pointing to the oak tree.

01:16:27.806 --> 01:16:29.076
You're pretty sick,
aren't you?

01:16:30.309 --> 01:16:31.911
Sick fucking terrorist,

01:16:31.944 --> 01:16:32.946
that's what you are.

01:16:33.345 --> 01:16:34.346
You like that?

01:16:36.882 --> 01:16:39.418
All of my acts
of so-called "terror"

01:16:39.452 --> 01:16:41.722
have been to level
the playing field.

01:16:46.492 --> 01:16:48.427
When the generator
is running

01:16:48.461 --> 01:16:50.296
and Project 725
is back online,

01:16:50.328 --> 01:16:51.997
you're going to
give me the code.

01:16:57.502 --> 01:16:58.871
What the...

01:17:05.377 --> 01:17:06.378
What happened?

01:17:16.521 --> 01:17:19.458
Fuck.
Just wrap me up.

01:17:19.492 --> 01:17:21.327
Find me a gun
and let's fucking go.

01:17:21.359 --> 01:17:22.961
I love your enthusiasm,

01:17:22.994 --> 01:17:24.096
but you're not
going anywhere.

01:17:25.131 --> 01:17:26.166
The fuck I'm not.

01:17:26.198 --> 01:17:28.534
Hey! They know
our location.

01:17:28.568 --> 01:17:30.470
It's only a matter of time
before they find us here.

01:17:31.604 --> 01:17:33.373
And I'm not losing
anyone else tonight.

01:17:40.912 --> 01:17:42.214
I'll draw their attention.

01:17:42.247 --> 01:17:44.583
Keep them as far away
from here as I can.

01:17:44.617 --> 01:17:47.353
When you think it's clear,
get the hell out.

01:17:47.386 --> 01:17:49.356
I'll meet you back at the edge
of the road when it's all over.

01:17:50.323 --> 01:17:51.458
No way.

01:18:02.935 --> 01:18:04.137
This is all my fault.

01:18:06.204 --> 01:18:07.239
But I'm gonna fix it.

01:18:12.411 --> 01:18:14.213
This time I'm putting a
bullet in the Pardoner.

01:18:17.582 --> 01:18:19.485
Put a second one in there
for me, too.

01:18:24.189 --> 01:18:25.491
And for Harrison.

01:18:26.425 --> 01:18:27.427
Hooah.

01:18:28.094 --> 01:18:29.863
Hooah.

01:18:29.895 --> 01:18:31.197
What about Eva
and Chalmers?

01:18:32.899 --> 01:18:34.868
I told you I got this.

01:19:59.685 --> 01:20:00.687
Um...

01:20:03.355 --> 01:20:05.958
I know it may not mean
much now, but, uh...

01:20:07.326 --> 01:20:09.229
for what it's worth,
I just want to say...

01:20:11.463 --> 01:20:12.465
I'm sorry.

01:20:14.399 --> 01:20:15.534
For everything.

01:20:39.125 --> 01:20:41.261
Sir.
Generator is back online.

01:20:51.503 --> 01:20:53.707
Here we are, Project 725.

01:20:55.408 --> 01:20:57.043
<i>Awaiting activation code.</i>

01:21:00.145 --> 01:21:01.280
You sure about this?

01:21:02.247 --> 01:21:03.582
'Cause once we do this,

01:21:03.615 --> 01:21:04.717
there's no going back.

01:21:06.519 --> 01:21:08.188
That's the point.

01:21:10.523 --> 01:21:13.226
A lot of innocent people
are going to die.

01:21:14.393 --> 01:21:16.296
Two years...

01:21:17.328 --> 01:21:19.298
we've spent working on this.

01:21:20.599 --> 01:21:21.601
The time,

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.136
all of the resources,

01:21:25.703 --> 01:21:27.340
all of the lives lost

01:21:27.372 --> 01:21:28.774
would be for nothing.

01:21:37.649 --> 01:21:40.019
If you don't want to be
a part of it, then say it.

01:21:42.755 --> 01:21:43.757
Say it!

01:21:45.858 --> 01:21:47.060
Say it!

01:21:50.462 --> 01:21:51.463
I do.

01:22:06.511 --> 01:22:08.480
I'm gonna give you
one last chance, Chalmers.

01:22:09.347 --> 01:22:11.384
Give me the code.

01:22:14.353 --> 01:22:15.387
Don't do it, Dad.

01:22:15.421 --> 01:22:17.123
Yeah, Dad. Don't do it.

01:22:20.626 --> 01:22:22.095
You're not gonna shoot her.

01:22:24.896 --> 01:22:26.432
Not if you want the code.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.104
You have no idea
what I will do.

01:22:31.136 --> 01:22:34.106
You're only delaying
the inevitable.

01:22:41.646 --> 01:22:42.715
Tell me!

01:22:44.216 --> 01:22:45.852
Tell me, you motherfucker!

01:22:45.885 --> 01:22:47.087
Now!

01:22:47.853 --> 01:22:50.489
- Don't.
- Tell me the code.

01:22:51.489 --> 01:22:53.893
No, Dad.
Dad, don't tell him.

01:22:53.926 --> 01:22:56.396
Don't tell him.
Don't tell him.

01:22:58.163 --> 01:22:59.164
Fine.

01:22:59.832 --> 01:23:01.367
- I'm sorry.
- No.

01:23:02.768 --> 01:23:04.537
- Don't tell him, don't.
- I'll do it.

01:23:04.569 --> 01:23:06.139
I'll give you
the goddamn code.

01:23:17.582 --> 01:23:18.585
Good.

01:23:44.676 --> 01:23:46.345
It worked. We're in.

01:23:53.618 --> 01:23:54.853
With the push
of a button...

01:23:56.622 --> 01:23:57.757
everything changes.

01:23:59.324 --> 01:24:02.162
So, what do we
destroy first?

01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:05.230
Good question.

01:24:08.867 --> 01:24:10.670
Why don't we let
the creator pick?

01:24:13.939 --> 01:24:15.375
You wanted
to change the world.

01:24:16.507 --> 01:24:17.743
Now's your chance.

01:24:19.377 --> 01:24:20.380
Pick.

01:24:25.317 --> 01:24:26.485
Fuck you.

01:24:27.418 --> 01:24:28.688
Fuck you!

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:30.289
Fuck you!

01:24:57.448 --> 01:24:58.483
Come in.

01:25:00.953 --> 01:25:01.955
Come in.

01:25:07.725 --> 01:25:08.961
<i>Come in.</i>

01:25:11.663 --> 01:25:13.666
<i>How
many men you got left, Pardoner?</i>

01:25:14.466 --> 01:25:16.002
Two? One?

01:25:17.670 --> 01:25:18.770
<i>The answer is none.</i>

01:25:20.905 --> 01:25:22.574
You're dead, Miller.

01:25:22.608 --> 01:25:24.409
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

01:25:25.344 --> 01:25:26.346
Let's play.

01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:53.972
Fuck this.

01:26:06.618 --> 01:26:08.421
I'm here, Miller.

01:26:08.453 --> 01:26:09.956
Let's finish this.
Man-to-man.

01:26:15.493 --> 01:26:16.496
Come here.

01:26:28.673 --> 01:26:29.809
Where do you think
you're going?

01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:35.782
You got any more
fancy words to say?

01:26:38.617 --> 01:26:39.652
I'm done talking.

01:26:58.837 --> 01:26:59.839
Come on.

01:27:21.592 --> 01:27:24.095
- Eva, you're not able...
- Maybe we can salvage it.

01:27:24.128 --> 01:27:26.365
No, no. You want
to change the world?

01:27:26.798 --> 01:27:27.966
This is how.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.702
Oh, I can't lose
this research.

01:27:30.269 --> 01:27:31.436
We have to destroy it.

01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:34.840
The board will fire
you from your own company.

01:27:34.872 --> 01:27:35.875
So what?

01:27:36.908 --> 01:27:38.411
We'll start our own company.

01:27:39.978 --> 01:27:41.913
Eva... please.

01:27:44.082 --> 01:27:45.918
It takes both
our fail-safes.

01:27:47.886 --> 01:27:49.088
- You're right.
- Okay.

01:27:56.627 --> 01:27:57.630
All right.

01:28:07.672 --> 01:28:09.141
Eva, let's do this.

01:28:16.547 --> 01:28:17.550
- Ready?
- Ready?

01:28:25.256 --> 01:28:26.458
Come on.

01:29:18.844 --> 01:29:20.246
I got your back, soldier.

01:30:11.697 --> 01:30:12.698
Hey.

01:30:14.832 --> 01:30:15.867
You okay?

01:30:18.203 --> 01:30:19.772
Do I look okay?

01:30:19.805 --> 01:30:22.775
Harrison...
would be proud.

01:30:22.807 --> 01:30:23.975
Fuck you.

01:30:24.009 --> 01:30:25.911
I've got a helluva
worker's comp claim.

01:30:25.944 --> 01:30:27.680
So, what now?

01:30:29.213 --> 01:30:31.583
Retirement sounds pretty
fucking good right about now.

01:30:33.719 --> 01:30:34.720
Yeah.

01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:36.922
I don't know
about you guys,

01:30:37.956 --> 01:30:39.925
but I can use
one last drink.

01:30:39.957 --> 01:30:42.226
Well, it better be
on Chapter House.

01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:43.695
I think
I can arrange that.

01:30:44.729 --> 01:30:45.763
Yeah, I'm good.

01:31:09.755 --> 01:31:10.789
Well, who's driving?

01:31:12.024 --> 01:31:13.057
Not me.

01:31:13.091 --> 01:31:14.627
Do you see
this fucking arm?
