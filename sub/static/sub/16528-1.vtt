00:00.935 --> 00:02.167
  ADULT ADAM:
 <i> Ah,</i> The Breakfast Club...

00:02.169 --> 00:05.871
      <i> � Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>
   <i> Truly the ultimate teen</i>
   <i> movie of the '80s.</i>

00:05.873 --> 00:09.541
          <i> � Ooh, ooh</i>
    <i> Every high school clique</i>
    <i> was represented.</i>

00:09.677 --> 00:11.477
     <i> The geeks, the jocks,</i>

00:11.479 --> 00:13.579
      <i> the loners,</i>
      <i> the Molly Ringwalds.</i>

00:13.581 --> 00:17.683
     <i> It showed us that</i>
     <i> if we'd sit and talk</i>
     <i> in a circle of trust,</i>

00:17.685 --> 00:19.284
    <i> we could all be friends.</i>

00:19.286 --> 00:20.219
        <i> � Won't You Come</i>
        <i> See About Me?</i>

00:20.221 --> 00:22.154
      <i> Of course, that</i>
      <i> didn't apply to me.</i>

00:22.156 --> 00:23.389
       <i> I was a freshman.</i>

00:23.391 --> 00:26.325
      <i> High school meant</i>
      <i> I had a clean slate.</i>

00:26.327 --> 00:29.128
       <i> The movie inspired me</i>
       <i> to reinvent myself.</i>

00:29.130 --> 00:32.264
               I am the coolest
               freshman alive.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.098
     ADULT ADAM: <i> I wasn't.</i>

00:33.100 --> 00:37.669
   <i> But, damn it, Judd Nelson</i>
   <i> sure taught me how to be.</i>

00:37.671 --> 00:39.671
                  What the hell
                  is this?

00:39.673 --> 00:42.107
                    Why aren't
                    you moving?

00:42.109 --> 00:43.375
                       Stop it!

00:43.377 --> 00:44.843
                   Start moving
                   your body!

00:44.845 --> 00:48.547
     <i> And lucky for me,</i>
     <i> I had a big older bro</i>
     <i> and sis</i>

00:48.549 --> 00:49.448
     <i> who would help me out.</i>

00:49.450 --> 00:50.516
     Why do you have
     so many outfits on?

00:50.518 --> 00:52.684
     Yeah, you look like a hobo
     who lives in a dumpster

00:52.686 --> 00:54.386
            behind a Burlington
            Coat Factory.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.020
 It's my new look.

00:55.022 --> 00:57.089
 I'm locking in
 who I'm gonna be
 for the next four years.

00:57.091 --> 00:59.525
    Did you cut the fingers off
    of my lace Madonna gloves?

00:59.527 --> 01:02.394
 Now they're fingerless
 tough-guy gloves...

01:02.396 --> 01:03.195
        with some lace.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.897
        Okay, here's how
        this year's gonna work.

01:04.899 --> 01:07.933
       During school hours,
       you will not walk, talk,

01:07.935 --> 01:09.034
            or breathe
            anywhere near us.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.135
         Well, what if
         I need you guys?

01:10.137 --> 01:12.237
         You definitely will,
         but we won't be there.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.572
              Thing is,
              I'm a senior now,

01:13.574 --> 01:15.974
         so my focus will be
         on being super popular

01:15.976 --> 01:16.775
            and making
            terrible mistakes

01:16.777 --> 01:18.177
              that will greatly
              affect my future.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.745
     And as one
     of the school's top jocks,

01:19.747 --> 01:21.647
     I'll be knocking the books
     out of your hands.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.415
 You're not the school's
 top anything!

01:23.417 --> 01:24.883
  This is madness!
                   Is it?

01:24.885 --> 01:26.985
         This year, I'm joining
         the varsity wrestling,

01:26.987 --> 01:29.621
             basketball,
             and cross-country.

01:29.623 --> 01:32.825
 Cross-country?
 Since when can you
 run far or fast?

01:32.827 --> 01:34.460
                 Oh, I run.
                 I run plenty.

01:34.462 --> 01:37.162
 Yeah,
 your weird Barry run.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.898
      Are you crazy?
      I don't run like that.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.633
          I run like this.

01:42.937 --> 01:43.869
       Yeah, it's probably best

01:43.871 --> 01:45.704
     that both of you stay away
     from me this year.

01:45.706 --> 01:48.273
          Schmoopaloos,
          exciting news!

01:48.275 --> 01:49.942
            We need to have
            a little talk.

01:49.944 --> 01:51.143
 Stop running.
 Eyes on me.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.644
 Remember how
 I told you all summer

01:52.646 --> 01:53.812
 I was taking
 a painting class

01:53.814 --> 01:56.014
 to help give my life
 a sense of purpose?
                  No.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.082
       Huh?
               Who paints what?

01:57.084 --> 01:59.218
 You people don't listen
 to a word I say.

01:59.220 --> 02:04.022
 And I would be deeply hurt
 if it wasn't all a total lie.

02:04.024 --> 02:06.125
 I was taking a course
 for this.

02:06.127 --> 02:06.992
 It's my teaching certificate.

02:06.994 --> 02:09.161
                      For what?
 For substitute teaching!

02:09.163 --> 02:10.162
                    For where?
        High school!

02:10.163 --> 02:11.697
         For which high school?
          Yours!

02:11.699 --> 02:14.066
               This... (GAGS)
               isn't happening!

02:14.068 --> 02:17.369
    That's right.
    You're gonna be seeing
    a whole lot more of Mama.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.170
                  Oh, balls!

02:18.172 --> 02:20.873
         (GIGGLES)
         Mwah, mwah, mwah!

02:20.875 --> 02:23.675
       I feel anger in my body!

02:24.044 --> 02:26.545
       See, that's it.
       That's the Barry run.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.883
     <i> � Hey, hey, hey, hey �</i>

02:30.885 --> 02:34.286
     ADULT ADAM:
     <i> It was September 3rd,</i>
     <i> 1980-something,</i>

02:34.288 --> 02:35.888
        <i> the night before</i>
        <i> school started,</i>

02:35.890 --> 02:38.290
    <i> and our worst nightmare</i>
    <i> had become reality.</i>

02:38.292 --> 02:42.861
       Question. What does
       this sweater say to you?

02:43.597 --> 02:44.196
       School?

02:44.198 --> 02:46.498
          That's exactly
          what I was going for.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.668
 Look at you.
 A real teacher.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.602
            While this might
            have begun as a way

02:50.604 --> 02:53.338
      for me to inappropriately
      track my children's
      every move,

02:53.340 --> 02:56.575
    it's given me
    a renewed sense of purpose.
 MURRAY: I'm thrilled.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.745
 You're always marching down
 there to make trouble anyhow.

02:59.747 --> 03:00.812
 Might as well
 get some money for it.

03:00.814 --> 03:05.017
 Also, you're supporting
 the most important woman
 in your life.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.418
   Sure! Why not?

03:06.420 --> 03:07.252
                (GASPS)

03:07.254 --> 03:08.854
    Hey! What do you think?

03:08.856 --> 03:10.589
 How does
 Professor Goldberg look?

03:10.591 --> 03:11.757
          Mom, you're not
          a professor.

03:11.759 --> 03:15.928
 Well, then why do I have
 a Ph.D in nose boops?

03:15.930 --> 03:17.129
 Boop, boop, boop! Ha!

03:17.131 --> 03:20.165
 See you in the halls,
 delicious pupils.

03:20.167 --> 03:20.799
             Excuse us, Father.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.167
           We hate to interrupt
           your evening,

03:22.169 --> 03:24.203
       but we would like
       to borrow a brief moment

03:24.205 --> 03:26.538
               of your valuable
               personal time.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.306
 What the hell's going on?

03:27.308 --> 03:29.775
 You morons always
 come in screaming
 when you want something.

03:29.777 --> 03:32.678
 It's true. This energy
 is very unnerving.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.881
   Shouting at you has produced
   poor results in the past,

03:35.883 --> 03:37.816
        and at this moment,
        our lives are at stake.

03:37.818 --> 03:41.520
       Which is why
       we came to you as calm,
       mature, young adults

03:41.522 --> 03:42.854
   to talk this out rationally.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.357
 Even Barry?
 Seems unlikely.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.658
    Agreed.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.293
 Since you're
 asking so politely,

03:48.295 --> 03:49.695
 I'll wait before I say no.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.530
             We need to discuss
             Mom's new position

03:51.532 --> 03:52.698
       at William Penn Academy.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.833
    As you know,
    children need healthy walls

03:54.835 --> 03:57.903
    between their academic
    and home lives.

03:57.905 --> 03:58.937
 And, if I may add,

03:58.939 --> 04:00.872
         Mom is a monster
         that must be stopped!

04:00.874 --> 04:02.274
            No, Barry!
                  You promised!

04:02.276 --> 04:03.575
 (SIGHS) Sorry! Sorry.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.177
 Well, the answer's no.

04:05.179 --> 04:07.045
 Have a good school year.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.781
 So, may I?

04:09.783 --> 04:11.183
                    Go to town.
          Do your thing.

04:11.185 --> 04:11.917
 W-What's going on here?

04:11.919 --> 04:15.053
 You make Mom quit
 or I will knock everything
 over you love,

04:15.055 --> 04:17.522
       starting with
       these thin books!

04:17.591 --> 04:18.156
              (GRUNTS)

04:18.158 --> 04:20.259
 What are you doing?
 You're scaring the dog!

04:20.261 --> 04:24.796
 I...am throwing...
 candies in anger!

04:24.898 --> 04:28.867
 Ooh. (PANTING)
 Went too hot too fast. Here.

04:29.370 --> 04:34.840
 I need... like five hours
 to recharge my anger.

04:38.979 --> 04:39.578
         (P.A. FEEDBACK)

04:39.580 --> 04:42.247
      BALL: <i> Hello, and welcome </i>
     <i> William Penn Academy.</i>

04:42.249 --> 04:45.484
 Thrilled to be back
 for what's shaping up to be

04:45.486 --> 04:46.918
 the most exciting
 school year with--

04:46.920 --> 04:49.388
 (YELLS) Oh, crap!
 She's already here!

04:49.390 --> 04:50.889
 Just get to class!

04:50.891 --> 04:51.757
 My God, lady.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.993
 It's the first minute
 of the school year.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.962
 (STAMMERING) Minute.
                  Oh, Earl.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.898
       I'm not here to beat you
       into submission.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.099
             I'm here to teach.

05:01.101 --> 05:01.733
 I'm sorry. Teach?

05:01.735 --> 05:04.136
           Yes. I got certified
           over the summer.

05:04.138 --> 05:05.437
      I'm on your list of subs.

05:05.439 --> 05:08.106
  I am unaware
  of any such list.

05:08.108 --> 05:08.740
                Here it is.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.342
 See? There's my
 name right there.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.644
         I put it there myself.
         Right at the top.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.545
                See it?
         Uh-huh.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.746
                See it? See?
      Yeah. I see.

05:14.748 --> 05:15.947
                   See?
       I see it.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.349
                     See?
 I see it, damn it!

05:17.351 --> 05:17.883
                Yay! (CHUCKLES)

05:17.885 --> 05:19.051
              So, where do you
              need me, boss?

05:19.053 --> 05:21.353
 Thing is,
 it is the first day of school

05:21.355 --> 05:23.655
 and all of my teachers
 are here and healthy.

05:23.657 --> 05:28.694
 So, I will give you a call
 as soon as... never.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.296
      I get the sense you don't
      want me here, Earl.

05:31.298 --> 05:31.730
        Oh, good!

05:31.732 --> 05:33.999
 Thanks for reading
 all the obvious social cues.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.734
         You're not seeing
         the big picture, boss.

05:35.736 --> 05:38.403
  You're gonna need me one day,
  and you know where I'll be?

05:38.405 --> 05:41.773
   Please don't
   say here.
            Here. Waiting.

05:41.775 --> 05:42.808
             Like a panther.

05:42.810 --> 05:43.575
         A panther who teaches.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.744
 Please don't wait
 like a teaching panther.

05:45.746 --> 05:46.545
        Oh, I'll wait but well,

05:46.547 --> 05:48.814
      'cause you never know
      when one of your teachers

05:48.816 --> 05:50.816
      might get sick
      or have a nasty accident.

05:50.818 --> 05:53.218
 Please don't hurt anybody.
               See you soon.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.287
     ADULT ADAM: <i> As my mom</i>
     <i> was anxious to</i>
     <i> get teaching,</i>

05:55.289 --> 05:58.123
       <i> I was about to teach</i>

 Welcome back, gentlemen.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.227
              Whoa. What's with
              all the jackets?

06:02.229 --> 06:04.096
               Yeah, man.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.331
       So swampy.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.300
 But that's the price
 of being a badass.

06:08.302 --> 06:10.369
 Wait.
 What's with your jacket?

06:10.371 --> 06:11.203
              Clean slate, bro.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.004
         This year,
         I'm reinventing myself

06:13.006 --> 06:15.240
            as a badass greaser
            like Fanzine.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.441
          Already got the hair.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.176
 Fanzine doesn't
 have a bowl cut.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.344
 And why are you
 in so much purple?

06:19.346 --> 06:22.114
         I'm reinventing myself
         to be a sexy badass
         like Prince.

06:22.116 --> 06:24.583
 We can't all reinvent
 ourselves as biases.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.484
 This is not good.

06:25.486 --> 06:28.053
    No one knows us here!
    We can be anything we want!

06:28.055 --> 06:30.288
          Hey, look.
          It's the jacket gang.

06:30.290 --> 06:32.958
 It's true!
 They're all wearing jackets!

06:32.960 --> 06:34.626
 It's what defines them.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.862
           Later, jacket jerks.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.430
                Oh, no.
         We've been mislabeled.

06:38.432 --> 06:39.498
                  Take 'em off!
                  Take 'em off!

06:39.500 --> 06:41.967
 It's too late.
 We can't be seen together
 till next semester.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.835
       Enjoy the holidays!

06:45.572 --> 06:47.205
 Erica!
 I need your help.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.574
       No, no, no!
       We had an agreement!

06:49.576 --> 06:50.809
           Dude,
           you're super sweaty.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.345
 I committed to this look
 before I checked the weather.

06:53.347 --> 06:54.546
 Please. I need help.

06:54.548 --> 06:55.180
                  I'm a senior.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.449
              I don't have time
              for any drama,
              especially yours.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.284
     Speaking of drama,
     what about Geoff Schwartz?

06:59.286 --> 07:00.452
               Who cares
               about that tool?

07:00.454 --> 07:02.788
              I mean, sure,
              he loved me
              his whole life

07:02.790 --> 07:03.922
                and I foolishly
                blew him off.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.891
     But now Geoff's with Envy,
     which is great,

07:05.893 --> 07:08.260
          'cause I can focus
          on my year of awesome

07:08.262 --> 07:10.328
      and really get out there.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.063
              Crap.
              Here they come.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.899
 Close the door.
 Close the metal door.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.067
 I... Slam it in my face.
 I can take it.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.702
 Please tell me
 they're gone.

07:17.704 --> 07:18.570
      Make a whole, people!

07:18.572 --> 07:21.973
       Peak physical champions
       coming through.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.508
 Check this out, fellas.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.843
            Boom!

07:24.845 --> 07:26.311
  Whoa. What are you
  doing, man?

07:26.313 --> 07:28.814
     That's not how you welcome
     somebody to our school.

07:28.816 --> 07:29.414
 But we're jocks.

07:29.416 --> 07:34.219
       We're student athletes,
       bro. Leaders on
       <i> and</i> off the field.

07:34.388 --> 07:36.455
         Have a good year,
         little man.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.757
 Wait up! I love nerds!
 Just...

07:38.759 --> 07:40.192
     I'll punch someone else.
     Just tell me who to punch.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.928
   ADULT ADAM:
   <i> Even though we were still</i>
   <i> trying to find our place</i>

07:42.930 --> 07:46.431
  <i> at school, our mom</i>
  <i> was feeling right at home.</i>

07:46.433 --> 07:49.668
 Oh, the teachers' lounge!

07:49.903 --> 07:52.337
 Oh! (CHUCKLES)
 So beautiful.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.138
            I'm home.

07:53.140 --> 07:57.375
           Well, well, well.
           The rumors are true.

07:57.377 --> 07:59.044
           Hello, Andre.

07:59.046 --> 07:59.744
 (LAUGHING) Oh.

07:59.746 --> 08:02.714
 I've been waiting for this
 moment a long, long time.

08:02.716 --> 08:06.017
        Thank you so much.
        I've worked really hard
        to get here.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.053
 Not to support you.
 To destroy you!

08:08.055 --> 08:11.623
                What?
 Well, maybe not destroy,
 but to be cold and distant.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.991
 Doesn't really
 come naturally to me.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.860
 I'm really a people person.
 Everybody says so.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.295
 But after all the times
 you made the teachers'
 lives hell,

08:17.297 --> 08:20.966
 did you really think
 that we were gonna
 accept you as one of us?

08:20.968 --> 08:21.933
            It wasn't personal.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.503
        I was just doing my job
        as Mama Bear.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.304
    Well, the bear's
    got no claws now.

08:26.306 --> 08:30.175
 (LAUGHS) That's right!
 We got the claws!

08:30.177 --> 08:30.942
      Rawer.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.443
         Let me do the talking,
         Bruce.

08:32.446 --> 08:34.479
 I'm afraid only
 real teachers

08:34.481 --> 08:36.114
 are welcome
 in the teachers' lounge.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.049
 (CHUCKLES)
 And you're not one of us.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.650
         So, where am I
         supposed to eat lunch?

08:39.653 --> 08:42.621
 The cafeteria.
 That's where all the subs eat.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.121
 All the subs
 and that new music teacher

08:44.124 --> 08:47.492
 who wants all the students
 to think that
 he's one of them.

08:47.494 --> 08:48.059
                 (SCOFFS)

08:48.061 --> 08:50.195
             Yeah, I had a band
             once, too, Cody.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.430
             Point is, get out!

08:52.666 --> 08:54.566
      <i> That day, my mom</i>
      <i> wasn't the only one</i>

08:54.568 --> 08:57.769
     <i> searching for a place</i>
     <i> to eat her lunch.</i>

08:57.771 --> 08:58.470
 Stupid Geoff and Envy,

08:58.472 --> 09:02.774
 ruining the cool table
 with their love and
 unsanitary food play.

09:02.776 --> 09:03.708
   Now I've got nowhere to sit.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.277
       I'm the one who needs
       to find the right table,

09:05.279 --> 09:07.746
       'cause where I sit
       will define me
       for the next four years.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.382
            It's just like
           <i> The Breakfast Club.</i>

09:10.384 --> 09:11.449
           Look at the cliques,

09:11.451 --> 09:14.553
 the cheerleaders, the burners,
 the band geeks,

09:14.555 --> 09:15.720
           the... Mom?

09:15.722 --> 09:17.722
     Hey, kids! Over here!

09:17.724 --> 09:18.623
    Come sit with your mother!

09:18.625 --> 09:21.493
       Oh! Balls, balls, balls.
      Son of a...

09:21.495 --> 09:23.028
 Um, your mom's here.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.663
           We know. We see her.

09:24.665 --> 09:25.931
    Yoo-hoo!
    Can you see me?

09:25.933 --> 09:26.898
            She's waving
            very clearly at us.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.367
  I'm your mama! I pushed you
  out of my swimsuit area!

09:29.369 --> 09:33.705
 Barry didn't want the jocks
 to see him screaming
 uncontrollably at his mother.

09:33.707 --> 09:34.306
         I've got grapes.

09:34.308 --> 09:36.041
 So he sent me over
 to talk some sense into her.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.510
        Let's just go
        before this gets worse.

09:38.512 --> 09:41.112
      Well, park your cute,
      little toughies.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.948
   I'm having
   a terrible first day.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.883
   I can't sit with
   my mom at lunch.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.685
 I'm already
 the sweaty jacket kid.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.687
 It would ruin any
 shred of cool I have left.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.723
 Forgive me, Mrs. G.,
 but Barry wants you to know,

09:51.725 --> 09:52.991
 "Get out, you monster!

09:52.993 --> 09:55.193
 "Get out through that window,
 right now!"

09:55.195 --> 09:56.528
 If you don't
 sit at this table,

09:56.530 --> 09:59.364
 then I have failed
 as a mother and an educator.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.131
 You are not an educator!

10:00.133 --> 10:01.800
 You are just a crazy lady
 in a worm sweater!

10:01.802 --> 10:05.003
 Okay, you are walking on
 very dangerous ground
 right now.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.238
 This worm is the only child
 I have left.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.808
 No one wants your sweater,
 and no one wants you!

10:09.810 --> 10:10.709
             Goldbergs, please!

10:10.711 --> 10:12.243
 What on Earth
 is going on over here?

10:12.245 --> 10:13.878
         I'll tell you
         what's going on, Earl.

10:13.880 --> 10:14.946
       You have some very mean,

10:14.948 --> 10:16.881
         disrespectful children
         at this school.

10:16.883 --> 10:17.983
 Well, they're your children.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.451
    Tell them
    what happens to a student

10:19.453 --> 10:20.852
     when they sass-mouth
     a teacher.

10:20.854 --> 10:21.786
            They get
            Saturday detention.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.189
 Why don't you tell her
 what happens to a teacher

10:24.191 --> 10:25.557
 who abuses her power?

10:25.559 --> 10:26.424
  Teachers get fired.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.394
       Oh, my God.
       Earl, write a detention.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.629
    It's not that (BLEEP) hard!

10:30.631 --> 10:33.932
 Whoa! Whoa! Everyone,
 go back to your lunches!

10:33.934 --> 10:35.500
 Not okay. Not okay.

10:35.502 --> 10:38.203
 What's not okay is you
 haven't told the blond lady

10:38.205 --> 10:38.903
 to hit the bricks!

10:38.905 --> 10:40.271
       Yeah, man!
       Do your job!

10:40.273 --> 10:43.942
 Barry was hoping you'd step in
 and wanted to add, uh,

10:43.944 --> 10:45.176
            "Grow some plums!"

10:45.178 --> 10:45.744
                 Okay, listen.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.145
           You kids cannot
           talk to me that way,

10:47.147 --> 10:50.148
       'cause now you really do
       have Saturday detention.

10:50.150 --> 10:50.915
          What?
              No!

10:50.917 --> 10:52.917
    How am I in trouble?
    I'm just Barry's messenger.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.486
   Well, then deliver this one.

10:54.488 --> 10:57.022
            I expect to see him
            Saturday, too.

10:57.157 --> 10:57.956
         (SCREAMS)

10:57.958 --> 10:59.891
     So much for my year
     of awesome!

10:59.893 --> 11:01.292
       Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah.

11:01.294 --> 11:01.926
    I officially give up,

11:01.928 --> 11:04.029
  and not just because
  my mom invaded my school,

11:04.031 --> 11:08.233
   but because I suck at love
   and I'm gonna die alone!

11:08.235 --> 11:09.801
 Forever alone!

11:11.071 --> 11:12.737
   Don't mind her.
   She's a basket case.

11:12.739 --> 11:14.572
 Also, you're fired
 from the job you never had.

11:14.574 --> 11:17.776
   Is it because I screamed out
   a bad word in the cafeteria?

11:17.778 --> 11:19.944
 Sort of a grab bag
 of things.

11:19.946 --> 11:22.147
              Oh, (BLEEP)

11:24.518 --> 11:27.485
       ADULT ADAM:
       <i> It was 7:00 a.m.</i>
       <i> Saturday morning,</i>

11:27.487 --> 11:29.254
    <i> and my dream of living</i>
    <i> The Breakfast Club</i>

11:29.256 --> 11:31.122
    <i> had become way too real.</i>

11:31.124 --> 11:34.526
          Well, well.
          Here we are.

11:34.528 --> 11:37.095
        It is now 7:06.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.698
      You have exactly
      8 hours and 54 minutes

11:39.700 --> 11:42.400
       to ponder
       the error of your ways.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.703
        My office is
        right across that hall.

11:44.705 --> 11:47.906
            Any monkey business
            is ill-advised.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.308
           Questions?
              I got a question.

11:50.310 --> 11:53.244
    Does Barry Manilow know
    that you raid his wardrobe?

11:53.246 --> 11:54.446
 Well, aren't you nice?

11:54.448 --> 11:57.282
 I happen to be
 quite the fan low.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.819
  No, it's from a movie.
  It's what the cool kid does--

12:00.821 --> 12:01.519
             And he's gone.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.455
 Eight hours?
 This is a nightmare.

12:03.457 --> 12:05.490
        No, it's not.
        It's just like
        <i> The Breakfast Club.</i>

12:05.492 --> 12:07.859
         Think about it.
         We're just like
         the characters.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.695
 Lainey's the popular princess.
 Barry's the jock.

12:10.697 --> 12:14.365
     And Erica's Ally Seedy,
     the crazy,
     unstable basket case.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.401
             Hey! I'm just
             a little depressed
             and uncovered

12:16.403 --> 12:19.037
       'cause I'm having
       a few boy issues, and...

12:19.039 --> 12:19.504
                     Shut up!

12:19.506 --> 12:22.807
 And I, of course, am Bender,
 the troubled bad boy.

12:22.809 --> 12:24.909
 You're the nerd, nerd.
 Everyone knows it.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.579
             I am not the nerd.
 You're the nerd, dude.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.380
          Who are you,
          and why are you here?

12:29.382 --> 12:32.951
 I'm Johnny Atkins,
 and I'm always here.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.054
 So needlessly destructive.

12:36.056 --> 12:39.224
           That's such an
           Anthony Michael Hall
           thing to say.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.959
             Totally.
  Classic nursery.

12:40.961 --> 12:41.793
             I am not the nerd.

12:41.795 --> 12:45.263
          I guess there will
          just be two bad boys.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.298
 Can't have two bad boys.

12:47.300 --> 12:47.966
        Okay. Babe, let's bail.

12:47.968 --> 12:51.102
 How? The only way out
 is past Ball's office.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.137
                Or is it?

12:52.139 --> 12:55.006
       Again, this is
       just like the movie.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.674
    No one cares
    about the stupid movie!

12:56.676 --> 12:58.810
 Now help me into the ceiling
 like in the movie!

12:58.812 --> 13:01.112
  <i> While Barry was running away</i>
  <i> from detention,</i>

13:01.114 --> 13:04.349
     <i> my mom was retreating</i>
     <i> to what she knew best.</i>

13:04.351 --> 13:05.216
               What's all this?

13:05.218 --> 13:07.318
 Oh, you know me.
 Busy, busy, busy.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.388
 If I don't get dinner
 on the table,
 nobody else will.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.422
                It's 8:00
                in the morning.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.892
         She's in a tizzy.
         Help her.

13:13.894 --> 13:17.228
             Bevy, you do this
             when you're upset.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.363
                  Or happy.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.198
          But right now, upset.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.366
    I'm not upset.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.033
 This house is a mess

13:22.035 --> 13:24.636
 because I let that silly,
 little teaching job
 get in the way,

13:24.638 --> 13:27.372
 but now I know
 this is where I belong.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.240
          But that teaching job
          meant so much to you.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.776
 Well, this family
 means so much more to me.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.712
 Also, nobody from the school
 wants me there.
              That's not true.

13:34.714 --> 13:38.183
 Principal Ball literally said,
 "I don't want you here."

13:38.185 --> 13:39.417
      Well,
      that could mean anything.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.518
 And the kids say
 I ruined their lives.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.755
       They ruined ours, too.
       It's the circle of life.

13:43.757 --> 13:45.056
    And the teachers
    hate my guts.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.991
   Well, there's history there.
 And I got fired.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.360
          Well, they clearly
          don't want you there,

13:49.362 --> 13:50.562
           so that makes sense.

13:50.564 --> 13:51.596
       You're not good at this.

13:51.598 --> 13:55.066
 I just realized
 I'm not a teacher.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.701
     I'm a mom.

13:56.703 --> 14:00.038
 I'm gonna go cheese-up
 some cod.

14:00.740 --> 14:03.141
        <i> Seeing my mom</i>
        <i> abandon her dream,</i>

14:03.143 --> 14:04.576
  <i> my dad did the unimaginable.</i>

14:04.578 --> 14:07.378
        <i> He got involved.</i>
               We need to talk.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.646
            Oh, good.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.315
     First week
     wouldn't seem complete

14:10.317 --> 14:12.183
         without uncomfortable
         quality time

14:12.185 --> 14:13.551
      with every Goldberg.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.620
        You need to let Beverly
        be a teacher again.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.789
 The thing is,
 she never was a teacher,

14:17.791 --> 14:19.824
 and she won't be
 as long as I'm in charge.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.993
         I think you're looking
         at this the wrong way.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.595
      If Beverly works for you,

14:23.597 --> 14:25.997
        she no longer
        comes here as a mother.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.198
             She's an employee.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.401
          Who's the boss
          of all the employees?

14:31.605 --> 14:32.036
         I am.

14:32.038 --> 14:35.106
     That means she'd no longer
     be your worst nightmare.

14:35.108 --> 14:39.043
  She'd be the worst nightmare
  of anyone you want her to be.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.246
     That's a scary amount
     of power.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.480
             I think you
             unleash the power.

14:42.482 --> 14:45.717
      You give me the word,
      and Beverly will be here.

14:45.719 --> 14:49.320
  Get on the horn
  and make it happen.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.689
 I am taking
 my Saturdays back!

14:51.691 --> 14:53.858
 The harpsichord
 in our living room

14:53.860 --> 14:56.361
 has been silent
 for too long!

14:56.363 --> 14:57.428
           Hot dog!

14:57.430 --> 14:59.063
             I'll call my wife.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.398
       She's gonna be thrilled.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.866
       You stupid, stupid man!

15:01.868 --> 15:03.902
               How could you
               do this to me?

15:03.904 --> 15:04.903
         You were so sad!

15:04.905 --> 15:06.371
     I actually did something
     good for once!

15:06.373 --> 15:08.973
             Seriously?
             Who marches down
             to the school

15:08.975 --> 15:11.242
          and makes
          unreasonable demands?

15:11.244 --> 15:13.278
        You do! All the time!

15:13.280 --> 15:14.145
           And who cares?

15:14.147 --> 15:16.247
          Earl said
          he wants you back.

15:16.249 --> 15:16.881
            Doesn't matter.

15:16.883 --> 15:19.851
   Even if Ball wants me there,
   my own kids don't.

15:19.853 --> 15:21.753
              Well, who's gonna
              sit here all day

15:21.755 --> 15:22.921
     and watch these damn kids?

15:22.923 --> 15:26.591
    You wanted to get involved?
    Get involved.

15:28.128 --> 15:28.993
             Aw, man.

15:28.995 --> 15:31.029
  I did not think this through.

15:31.031 --> 15:34.766
 I'm hungry,
 and my thighs are so cramp.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.201
  Why didn't I just go
  out the window?

15:43.610 --> 15:45.376
       I really need to shower.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.211
    All right, morons.
    Listen up.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.913
         Dad? Why are you here?

15:48.915 --> 15:49.647
 I've been put in charge.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.749
   Sweet. You're not a teacher,
   so we can bail.

15:51.751 --> 15:54.786
 Oh! I'm worse than a teacher.
 I'm your dad.

15:54.788 --> 15:58.623
 And that means,
 I can take away everything
 you know and love.

15:58.625 --> 16:02.327
       Well, you're not my dad,
       so I'm out of here, man.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.696
 That's fine.
 I don't even know who that is.

16:04.698 --> 16:07.532
 The rest of you
 are gonna be writing an essay

16:07.534 --> 16:08.266
 of at least 1,000 words.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.134
           An essay that will
           bond us together

16:10.136 --> 16:11.869
            like in
           <i> The Breakfast Club?</i>

16:11.871 --> 16:13.604
 No. You're gonna write
 nice things about your mom.

16:13.606 --> 16:16.841
  Make her feel
  like you want her
  around all the time.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.810
          That's the opposite
          of what we want.

16:18.812 --> 16:19.577

         our deepest secrets.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.169
     This isn't
     a John Hughes movie, dude.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.270
   No! I refuse to accept that.

16:46.272 --> 16:49.707

 Where you been all week?

19:41.181 --> 19:42.980
                 Laying low.

 Beverly, some jerk

        ADAM: <i> "In the end,</i>
       <i> we're a family."</i>

19:58.498 --> 19:59.630
 I got to go move my car.

 "And that means

            What are you doing?

20:22.488 --> 20:23.688
 Nothing. Go away.

           Okay, well,
           since you're frozen,

20:25.391 --> 20:26.390
            I'm gonna
            take my gnub-gnubs.

        (CHUCKLES) Gnub, gnub,
        gnub, gnub, gnub, gnub!
         No! No!

20:29.429 --> 20:30.728
 No gnub-gnubs

              Oh, hi.

          Um, I go to his
          school now. Uh...

20:47.113 --> 20:50.982
     MURRAY:
     Go put a pair of socks on!
     Go get dressed!

20:51.718 --> 20:54.085
    It's a quarter after 7:00.
    Please.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.921
 ADAM: A quarter after 7:00?
                Yes.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.661
      Whoa.
      What's with the bolo tie?

21:03.663 --> 21:05.763
 I've come to terms
 that I'm the lovable nerd,

21:05.765 --> 21:07.832
 like Duckie
 from <i> Pretty in Pink.</i>

21:07.834 --> 21:09.400
 And I've decided
 to embrace it.

21:09.402 --> 21:10.534
 Wait. Why are you guys
 wearing hats, too?

21:10.536 --> 21:14.138
       'Cause I want
       the cool kids to think
       I'm a rugged adventurer,

21:14.140 --> 21:14.905
            like Indiana Jones.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.274
             And I'm hoping
             this Devo hat

21:16.276 --> 21:17.942
        lands me a spot
        in the New Wave crowd.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.278
 Gentlemen,
 high school's gonna rock.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.779
           Nice hats, hat boys.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.649
 You're all wearing hats
 like idiots!

21:24.651 --> 21:25.716
 That's your thing!

21:25.718 --> 21:27.952
           Later, hat heads.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.055
     High school's gonna suck.
