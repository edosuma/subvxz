00:00.001 --> 00:02.935
I'm gonna steal this picture
right out from under your nose,

00:02.937 --> 00:04.136
And you know I can do it.

00:04.138 --> 00:06.171
Are you threatening me?

00:06.173 --> 00:07.939
Announcer: Feud: Bette and joan.

00:07.941 --> 00:10.574
All-new, Sunday at 10:00 on fx.

00:11.943 --> 00:14.344
â™ª fx presents
baskets.

00:19.316 --> 00:22.151
I, uh, brought mom a
toilet because I broke hers.

00:22.153 --> 00:23.185
Is she here?

00:23.187 --> 00:24.352
She ain't here, honey.

00:24.354 --> 00:25.853
Where is she?

00:25.855 --> 00:27.988
Welcome to the denver
international airport.

00:27.990 --> 00:31.957
Chip, I'm out of town and
I need you to take meemaw

00:31.959 --> 00:34.225
To her doctor's appointment.

00:34.227 --> 00:35.893
Esther, do that
little dance you do.

00:35.895 --> 00:37.728
A 5, 6, 7, 8!

00:40.699 --> 00:42.065
Hello?

00:49.005 --> 00:50.672
Sorry for your loss.

00:50.674 --> 00:52.340
Tell me a little bit
about your mother?

00:52.342 --> 00:54.842
Oh, she's um...

00:54.844 --> 00:57.177
She was, uh...

00:57.179 --> 01:00.480
A complicated woman.

01:00.482 --> 01:02.248
No, just her size.

01:02.250 --> 01:03.515
Oh, her size.

01:03.517 --> 01:05.250
She's petite.

01:05.252 --> 01:09.987
Actually, we have a really
great option on mothers.

01:09.989 --> 01:12.255
Uh, the mother casket.

01:12.257 --> 01:14.590
It comes very, very
highly rated.

01:14.592 --> 01:17.225
Whose rating it, ghosts?

01:17.227 --> 01:18.993
18 gauge steel.

01:18.995 --> 01:21.428
Painted lilac finish.

01:23.364 --> 01:24.597
Hmm.

01:27.067 --> 01:28.667
I guess I'll take that one.

01:28.669 --> 01:30.769
Your mother's gonna love it.

01:37.042 --> 01:40.177
Chip, martha!

01:40.179 --> 01:42.612
There's only one of them.
Which one is that,
which one is that?

01:42.614 --> 01:44.447
I can't tell from
this far away.

01:44.449 --> 01:45.448
Oh, god.

01:45.450 --> 01:46.882
Uh, it may be logan.

01:46.884 --> 01:49.584
Yeah, it may be logan or
it may be cody, right?

01:49.586 --> 01:51.118
Does he have a black eye?

01:51.120 --> 01:53.220
Yes, it's a black guy.
They're both black.

01:53.222 --> 01:55.388
- Hey.
- Hey, what's going on?

01:55.390 --> 01:56.789
How you doing?

01:56.791 --> 01:57.956
All is well.
What's going on?

01:57.958 --> 02:00.091
Where's my other brother?

02:00.093 --> 02:01.725
Logan? Oh, he's driving
in from l.A.

02:01.727 --> 02:03.226
Coop, that one's cody.

02:03.228 --> 02:04.794
Yeah, martha.
So nice to see you, cody.

02:04.796 --> 02:06.395
Good to see you.

02:06.397 --> 02:07.763
It kinda sucks, you know,
grandma dying and all.

02:07.765 --> 02:09.631
Yeah, it's rough.

02:09.633 --> 02:10.798
It's rough.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.566
- Martha.
- Good to see you.

02:12.568 --> 02:14.067
Good to see you.

02:14.069 --> 02:16.569
Um, what happened
to your eye?

02:16.571 --> 02:19.204
This? Collateral
party damage.

02:19.206 --> 02:20.872
Oh.

02:23.976 --> 02:25.977
- Should we go?
- Let's go.

02:28.614 --> 02:30.981
Oh, look at these.

02:30.983 --> 02:32.949
They're so beautiful.

02:32.951 --> 02:34.617
Who are these from?

02:34.619 --> 02:36.118
Ken!

02:36.120 --> 02:39.554
Oh, will you put
them up by meemaw?

02:39.556 --> 02:41.656
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

02:41.658 --> 02:43.424
So beautiful.

02:43.426 --> 02:45.793
oh, logan.

02:45.795 --> 02:46.960
So sorry for your loss.

02:46.962 --> 02:49.128
Thank you, oh.

02:49.130 --> 02:52.064
Hey, mom.

02:52.066 --> 02:54.433
Oh, cody.

02:54.435 --> 02:56.768
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

02:56.770 --> 02:58.503
Thank you, cody.

02:58.505 --> 03:00.137
Oh, so nice of you
boys to make it.

03:00.139 --> 03:03.607
I know how busy you are
with your djing schedule.

03:03.609 --> 03:05.308
What happened to your eye?

03:05.310 --> 03:06.909
Hey, dale?

03:06.911 --> 03:08.343
Where's the family?

03:08.345 --> 03:10.078
Who cares?

03:10.080 --> 03:12.413
He's under stress.

03:12.415 --> 03:13.747
Hey, barbara.

03:13.749 --> 03:15.315
Uncle jim.

03:15.317 --> 03:16.749
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:16.751 --> 03:17.983
How are you doing?

03:17.985 --> 03:19.784
Good. How are you?

03:19.786 --> 03:22.086
Little dale.
Christine's boy.

03:22.088 --> 03:23.620
Right, right, dale.

03:23.622 --> 03:24.621
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:24.623 --> 03:25.822
How you been?

03:25.824 --> 03:27.690
Well, I'm... I'm doing okay.

03:27.692 --> 03:28.857
You're chip's brother.

03:28.859 --> 03:30.758
Yeah. Yeah, chip's brother.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.292
How you been?

03:32.294 --> 03:33.760
Oh, well, getting audited
over at the school.

03:33.762 --> 03:36.028
Uh, gonna have to
do some budget cuts.

03:36.030 --> 03:38.864
You know, I was gonna
maybe pick your brain
about bankruptcy.

03:38.866 --> 03:41.433
And, uh, I just thought,
maybe, you know,

03:41.435 --> 03:43.101
There's uncle jim.

03:43.103 --> 03:44.669
He knows about
this kind of stuff.

03:44.671 --> 03:46.837
I don't.
I've never been audited.

03:46.839 --> 03:47.838
I've never been
bankrupt.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.105
Okay.

03:49.107 --> 03:50.673
I'm going to go
say hi to your mom.

03:50.675 --> 03:52.875
Okay, sure.

03:52.877 --> 03:55.377
Hey, dorothy.
Hey, walt.

03:55.379 --> 03:56.878
Guess who?

03:56.880 --> 03:58.045
Jim?

03:58.047 --> 04:00.347
My brother, I'd know
those hands.

04:00.349 --> 04:01.715
- My little lady.
- Welcome.

04:01.717 --> 04:03.149
Long time, no see, huh?

04:03.151 --> 04:05.351
Where's sherry
and the kids, jim?

04:05.353 --> 04:07.653
- Cabo.
- Oh, god.

04:07.655 --> 04:10.355
Yeah, quizno's
franchise owners.

04:10.357 --> 04:11.789
Big deal, I had
to slip out.

04:11.791 --> 04:13.624
- They're still there.
- Oh, god.

04:13.626 --> 04:15.192
Yeah, I know, it's just
very bad timing,
this whole thing.

04:15.194 --> 04:17.327
Yeah.
I was out of town.

04:17.329 --> 04:19.329
- Really? Where were you?
- I was up in the
mile-high city.

04:19.331 --> 04:21.030
My god.

04:21.032 --> 04:23.132
I got some things going
that are pretty exciting, jim.

04:23.134 --> 04:24.466
- I'm excited about them.
- That's good.

04:24.468 --> 04:26.301
I wish mom was
here for them, though.

04:26.303 --> 04:29.337
I know, it's just very
emotional for both of
us right now.

04:29.339 --> 04:32.673
It's... Listen,
is herb whatsits

04:32.675 --> 04:34.474
Still handling mom
and dad's financials?

04:34.476 --> 04:36.642
Of course, he's
sharp as a tack.

04:36.644 --> 04:37.709
Is he here today?

04:37.711 --> 04:38.910
I think so.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.912
Yeah, there he is
over there.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.813
Are you sure this
isn't his funeral?

04:42.815 --> 04:44.981
Oh, jim.

04:44.983 --> 04:47.583
So silly.

04:47.585 --> 04:49.551
Oh, martha?

04:49.553 --> 04:51.252
- Yeah?
- Could you get lambchop?

04:51.254 --> 04:53.887
I don't want her peeing there.
That dog pees everywhere.

04:53.889 --> 04:55.255
I've seen it.

04:55.257 --> 04:56.923
You know, I don't think
she has to pee.

04:56.925 --> 04:59.759
I think she just misses
her meemaw, probably.

04:59.761 --> 05:00.760
Yeah, okay.

05:00.762 --> 05:01.927
How are you doing?

05:01.929 --> 05:03.762
I'm good,
keeping myself busy.

05:03.764 --> 05:05.997
You know, we've got,
you know, people coming over

05:05.999 --> 05:10.401
To pay their respects and
that's always a nice thing.

05:10.403 --> 05:11.402
Yeah.

05:11.404 --> 05:13.070
You know.

05:13.072 --> 05:15.572
I, uh... Remember that guy?

05:15.574 --> 05:18.007
- Yeah?
- I went to see him.

05:18.009 --> 05:19.441
Oh, that's great,
mrs. Baskets.

05:19.443 --> 05:20.442
Denver.

05:20.444 --> 05:22.110
And you were right.

05:22.112 --> 05:24.278
There was
a sexual vibe.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.746
Did I say that?

05:25.748 --> 05:28.381
You did, and I had
a terrific time, martha.

05:28.383 --> 05:31.450
That city, it's like,
you know...

05:31.452 --> 05:34.553
So high, so technically,
I guess, you know,

05:34.555 --> 05:37.422
I'm part of the
mile-high club.

05:37.424 --> 05:38.956
Well, that's great.

05:38.958 --> 05:41.625
I know, I had so much
fun I got caught up in it.

05:41.627 --> 05:45.595
I forgot about my kids,
I forgot about my house.

05:45.597 --> 05:48.097
I forgot about my mom.
I should've been here.

05:48.099 --> 05:50.699
I was supposed to take
her to that appointment.

05:50.701 --> 05:54.135
And, um... I just
feel like I killed her.

05:54.137 --> 05:56.103
You didn't, mrs. Baskets.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.471
It wasn't your fault.

05:57.473 --> 05:59.739
Well, martha,
I hope you're right.

05:59.741 --> 06:01.307
I'm sure I'm right.

06:01.309 --> 06:05.610
Are they here already?

06:05.612 --> 06:08.879
When I die I'd like to be
scattered in the pacific ocean.

06:08.881 --> 06:10.480
You mean like
your ashes scattered?

06:10.482 --> 06:12.215
Or your body parts?

06:12.217 --> 06:14.650
Martha, martha, martha,
looking beautiful like always.

06:14.652 --> 06:16.318
Chip, what's up, baby?

06:16.320 --> 06:18.653
Cod.

06:18.655 --> 06:20.154
Hello.

06:20.156 --> 06:22.456
Yo, man, can I talk to you
outside for a sec?

06:22.458 --> 06:25.325
Naw, whatever you got to say,
you can say it in front
of martha and chip.

06:25.327 --> 06:27.593
Come on, man,
this ain't the place.

06:28.762 --> 06:30.861
All right, fine, man.

06:33.097 --> 06:35.565
Oh... Oh.

06:35.567 --> 06:37.099
Was that weird?

06:37.101 --> 06:38.500
I just needed
a little space.

06:38.502 --> 06:40.768
No, not that.
I think something's going on

06:40.770 --> 06:42.402
With cody and logan.

06:42.404 --> 06:44.771
They're not speaking
in unison as much.

06:44.773 --> 06:46.439
God, if I had to spend
that much time with dale,

06:46.441 --> 06:48.007
I'd be angry, too.

06:48.009 --> 06:49.775
Ain't enough whiskey
in the whiskey salad.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.810
Hard to get drunk.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.112
Maybe you should
go check on them.

06:54.114 --> 06:57.748
I mean, you do cheer people
up for a living.

07:02.353 --> 07:03.453
Where's logan?

07:03.455 --> 07:04.921
Huh?

07:04.923 --> 07:07.089
- Where's logan?
- Oh, man, he bounced.

07:07.091 --> 07:10.858
Everything going okay
with you guys and the
chemical brothers tour?

07:10.860 --> 07:12.893
Mm-hmm, it's cool,
it's cool.

07:12.895 --> 07:15.295
No, what's new with you?

07:15.297 --> 07:19.732
Oh, I was homeless and saw
a guy get cut in half
by a train.

07:19.734 --> 07:21.066
Uh-huh, mm-hmm.

07:21.068 --> 07:22.734
Other than that,
not much going on.

07:22.736 --> 07:24.534
Right, right.
Tight. Tight.

07:27.037 --> 07:30.072
To be honest, chip,

07:30.074 --> 07:33.208
The chemical brothers
fired us a few weeks ago.

07:33.210 --> 07:34.642
What?

07:34.644 --> 07:37.111
Yeah, man. Logan hooked up
with one of their girls,

07:37.113 --> 07:38.912
They weren't happy
about it.

07:38.914 --> 07:40.380
Man, oh man, that's not
relatable at all,

07:40.382 --> 07:42.048
But I understand.

07:42.050 --> 07:43.883
That's a bummer.

07:43.885 --> 07:46.485
Plus a lot of guys want
to punch logan in the face.

07:46.487 --> 07:48.386
And since I got
the same face as him...

07:48.388 --> 07:50.154
That's been difficult.

07:50.156 --> 07:51.622
Oh, god, yeah, of course.

07:51.624 --> 07:52.923
Yeah. Plus I haven't
seen logan in a month.

07:52.925 --> 07:54.958
Shacked up with this girl,

07:54.960 --> 07:56.993
And now he's talking
about going solo.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.462
Well, maybe... Maybe...

08:00.464 --> 08:02.297
He could talk
to mom about it.

08:02.299 --> 08:04.899
Uh-uh. Mom can't know
about this.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.167
All right? Grammy's death,
this would kill her.

08:07.169 --> 08:08.568
Now, how would that look?

08:08.570 --> 08:10.069
I mean, we're
the basket brothers.

08:10.071 --> 08:11.303
I mean, us falling apart?

08:11.305 --> 08:13.405
Oh, naw.

08:13.407 --> 08:14.839
It don't even look right.

08:14.841 --> 08:16.974
Yeah. Well, we got to
nip this in the bud.

08:16.976 --> 08:18.642
Yeah, we need to.

08:18.644 --> 08:20.343
Hey, dale, can we
borrow your van?

08:20.345 --> 08:21.677
We got to go get logan.

08:21.679 --> 08:23.679
Does the place you're
going have booze?

08:23.681 --> 08:24.813
Oh, yeah.

08:24.815 --> 08:27.148
I'm driving. Look out.

08:27.150 --> 08:29.250
Can you hold that, please?

08:29.252 --> 08:31.018
All right, let's go.

08:31.020 --> 08:32.419
Bye, guys.

08:35.456 --> 08:38.624
Martha, could you start
picking up everyone's trash?

08:38.626 --> 08:42.126
- Um, sure, mrs. Baskets.
- Thank you.

08:42.128 --> 08:43.760
Thanks.

08:51.868 --> 08:55.103
I'll meet you guys in there.
I've got to make a phone call.

08:55.105 --> 08:57.138
What do you want to drink?

08:57.140 --> 08:58.706
Whatever you're having.

08:58.708 --> 09:01.175
That will be two
mimosas on the rocks.

09:01.177 --> 09:03.677
No ice, no ice, dale.

09:08.382 --> 09:09.682
Hello?

09:09.684 --> 09:11.784
Hi, penelope,
it's chip.

09:11.786 --> 09:13.352
<i>Hello?</i>

09:13.354 --> 09:15.320
Can you hear me?
Penelope, it's chip.

09:15.322 --> 09:16.721
<i>Chip baskets.</i>

09:16.723 --> 09:18.489
Chip-oo!

09:18.491 --> 09:20.691
Oh, how nice to
hear you.

09:20.693 --> 09:23.060
<i>Well, listen I'll just get</i>
<i>right to the point, penelope.</i>

09:23.062 --> 09:25.328
Do you remember my
dj twin brothers?

09:25.330 --> 09:26.896
Sure.

09:26.898 --> 09:29.031
<i>I was hoping to maybe</i>
<i>find them a gig</i>

09:29.033 --> 09:32.134
With maybe an established
dj or a band.

09:32.136 --> 09:35.170
You know, an opening
act situation.

09:35.172 --> 09:37.305
Um, and I thought since you
were in the music business,

09:37.307 --> 09:40.508
That maybe you had
some connections.

09:40.510 --> 09:43.410
I know it's stupid,
penelope.

09:43.412 --> 09:46.980
No, no, no, it's okay.
I'm looking at my contact here.

09:46.982 --> 09:48.481
- <i>Oh really? </i>
<i>- I have a lot of friends</i>

09:48.483 --> 09:51.984
In music: Basement jaxx,
twin dj.

09:51.986 --> 09:53.752
Uh, sneaker pimp.

09:53.754 --> 09:56.221
Oh, god, penelope,
if you could do this,

09:56.223 --> 09:57.755
It would be really,
really helpful.

09:57.757 --> 10:00.023
Uh, so thank you very,
very much.

10:00.025 --> 10:03.426
It's so nice to hear
you chips. Really.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.928
Really beautiful to
hear your

10:05.930 --> 10:07.696
Nice little voice.

10:07.698 --> 10:10.832
It's nice to hear your...
Your voice, too, penelope.

10:12.936 --> 10:14.501
<i>I miss you sometime.</i>

10:16.270 --> 10:17.503
You do?

10:17.505 --> 10:19.037
<i>Yes.</i>

10:19.039 --> 10:22.740
Sometime I think of
your stupid joke and...

10:22.742 --> 10:24.341
I miss you.

10:24.343 --> 10:26.376
Huh, okay.

10:26.378 --> 10:27.710
Well, I mean, you have
my number now,

10:27.712 --> 10:29.244
So you can,
you can, uh...

10:29.246 --> 10:32.213
You can call me any time
you want if you like.

10:32.215 --> 10:35.416
<i>I have a new cellular phone.</i>
<i>It's pink.</i>

10:39.620 --> 10:41.621
You take good care, yeah?

10:41.623 --> 10:45.257
<i>Okay, yes, so you'll just</i>
<i>maybe call me and let me know</i>

10:45.259 --> 10:46.391
<i>If you get in touch</i>
<i>with anybody.</i>

10:46.393 --> 10:48.259
Yes, I'll, I'll, um...

10:48.261 --> 10:51.762
I'll text some dj I know and
I'll call you back, okay?

10:51.764 --> 10:53.964
Okay, great.
Uh, thanks, penelope.

10:53.966 --> 10:56.466
I'll talk to you
right away.

11:05.975 --> 11:08.409
Oh, look at that.
Who am I holding there?

11:10.146 --> 11:11.478
I have no idea
who that is.

11:11.480 --> 11:12.946
Oh, oh, no.

11:12.948 --> 11:14.881
Hey, what are you
doing up there?

11:14.883 --> 11:16.916
Exactly. What are you
doing up there?

11:16.918 --> 11:20.152
Oh, you know mom used
to let her eat on
the table with her...

11:20.154 --> 11:21.553
- No way.
- For company.

11:21.555 --> 11:23.388
Oh, come on.

11:23.390 --> 11:25.390
Oh, it's not going
to hurt anything.

11:25.392 --> 11:26.924
Are you kidding?

11:26.926 --> 11:28.158
It's just a little dog.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.893
There's germs all over
the place now.

11:29.895 --> 11:31.394
You know what dad would do
if he saw this thing up here?

11:31.396 --> 11:33.796
Kick that thing right
out of here, kaboom!

11:33.798 --> 11:36.565
You know, that's right,
dad would kick the dog
out of there.

11:36.567 --> 11:37.933
Like he kicked us around.

11:37.935 --> 11:39.467
He...

11:39.469 --> 11:41.602
Oh, he spanked us
all the time for no reason.

11:41.604 --> 11:43.770
No, he only spanked us
when there was a reason,

11:43.772 --> 11:45.238
And there were a lot
of good reasons.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.740
I think you are a little
cloudy in your memories.

11:47.742 --> 11:49.007
For instance, look here.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.441
Here's all of us in front
of the car.

11:50.443 --> 11:53.310
Yeah, on mom's birthday,
he got mom flowers

11:53.312 --> 11:54.511
And he got himself
a new car.

11:54.513 --> 11:56.312
Yes, but he took us
all on a trip.

11:56.314 --> 11:57.980
- That was horrible.
- That was great!

11:57.982 --> 11:59.781
Oh my god, that was the worst.

11:59.783 --> 12:00.915
Camping...

12:00.917 --> 12:02.082
- Oh.
- Dad was so cheap.

12:02.084 --> 12:03.917
He wouldn't even pay
for a cabin.

12:03.919 --> 12:06.653
You know, I don't like
what you're insinuating
about dad.

12:06.655 --> 12:08.354
In fact, I think you're making
a lot of this stuff up

12:08.356 --> 12:11.023
Just to... Cover
your own problems

12:11.025 --> 12:12.691
In your own family.

12:19.931 --> 12:21.364
You know what?

12:21.366 --> 12:22.832
It's been a
long day, jim.

12:22.834 --> 12:25.567
I'm gonna take you back
to the hotel.

12:29.138 --> 12:31.605
That's such great news.
Thanks so much.

12:31.607 --> 12:33.540
Okay, bye.

12:34.508 --> 12:35.674
Did you find logan?

12:35.676 --> 12:37.942
Over there with them.

12:37.944 --> 12:40.210
You never know,
but that's the reason
I don't make corn muffins.

12:41.813 --> 12:45.381
Hey, uh, listen, do you
guys happen to have a video

12:45.383 --> 12:48.851
Of you, I don't know,
djing or whatever it
is you do?

12:48.853 --> 12:50.886
Naw, we did have a joint
youtube account, but

12:50.888 --> 12:52.520
Logan deleted it.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.121
Mimosas!

12:54.123 --> 12:55.722
Cheers, guys.

12:55.724 --> 12:58.391
- Cheers, bro.
- Chin-chin.

12:58.393 --> 13:00.993
Oh, I'm gonna get
fried tonight.

13:00.995 --> 13:02.561
- Hey, dale.
- Yeah, buddy?

13:02.563 --> 13:04.229
Can you help me make a
video of these two djing?

13:04.231 --> 13:06.030
Is that possible?

13:06.032 --> 13:07.564
What are you talking about?
We're in a bar right now.

13:07.566 --> 13:09.465
Dj with what?

13:09.467 --> 13:12.634
If we can get a video
e-mailed out tonight

13:12.636 --> 13:16.137
Of you guys disc jockeying
or whatever it is,

13:16.139 --> 13:19.806
There maybe a slot open
on this future tour, maybe.

13:19.808 --> 13:21.374
That's it.

13:21.376 --> 13:22.875
That sounds good
and all, I mean,

13:22.877 --> 13:24.543
But I don't know
if logan's down.

13:24.545 --> 13:27.345
I'll-- I'll work on logan.
I'll work on logan.

13:27.347 --> 13:29.180
- You sure?
- Yes, I promise.

13:29.182 --> 13:30.981
All right, then, bro,
I'll take your word then.

13:30.983 --> 13:33.016
Okay, so, what do you need?

13:33.018 --> 13:34.484
I mean, what kind of
things do we need to
get this thing going?

13:34.486 --> 13:35.718
We need two computers.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.853
- Computers?
- Yeah, computers.

13:37.855 --> 13:40.889
Well, I can get you a laptop
or two if that's what you need.

13:43.926 --> 13:45.593
I'm never gonna remember
the combination.

13:45.595 --> 13:47.061
Let me try this. Um...

13:47.063 --> 13:48.662
Here, take this one.

13:48.664 --> 13:50.664
- This one?
- I'm just gonna, let's see.

13:50.666 --> 13:52.866
You know what? Just try
grabbing it.

13:52.868 --> 13:55.067
Just give it a good, tight...

13:57.737 --> 14:00.338
- Dale?
- Chris, god!

14:00.340 --> 14:01.939
Why aren't you at
your aa meeting?

14:01.941 --> 14:03.541
I don't drink.

14:03.543 --> 14:06.043
Well, maybe you should,
loosen your ass up.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.944
Oh, I was just getting
things ready for the audit.

14:07.946 --> 14:11.713
Okay, why don't you want,
a parade?

14:11.715 --> 14:13.948
Um, this is my brother, uh...

14:13.950 --> 14:15.549
Cody, nice to
meet you, honey.

14:15.551 --> 14:16.783
You, too.

14:16.785 --> 14:19.118
Okay, we'll just
take our leave.

14:19.120 --> 14:21.453
Um...

14:21.455 --> 14:24.022
I forgot to disconnect myself.

14:24.024 --> 14:25.656
Uh, don't forget,
I own the joint,

14:25.658 --> 14:28.225
So nothing about this
in the comment box.

14:41.805 --> 14:43.238
Well, listen, thank you
for bringing me back.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.240
Thank you for everything
you did today

14:45.242 --> 14:47.075
For the tribute, and
for mom and everything.

14:47.077 --> 14:48.142
It was nice, wasn't it?

14:48.144 --> 14:49.376
It was very nice.

14:49.378 --> 14:50.844
Whiskey salad was amazing.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.879
I haven't had that in...

14:52.881 --> 14:56.649
- Yeah.
- Can't remember the last
time I had that.

14:56.651 --> 14:58.751
It's too bad we had to get
that whole thing about dad.

14:58.753 --> 15:00.853
You know, I mean, I know
he was hard.

15:00.855 --> 15:02.688
I know he was hard
on everybody.

15:02.690 --> 15:04.723
But he was always fair.

15:04.725 --> 15:08.059
No, no. You've got
it wrong again.

15:08.061 --> 15:09.760
I thought you
were off that.

15:09.762 --> 15:10.994
You're back on it?

15:10.996 --> 15:12.161
He was a mean drunk.

15:12.163 --> 15:13.395
Oh.

15:13.397 --> 15:14.929
He was selfish and
he was cruel.

15:14.931 --> 15:15.930
Well...

15:15.932 --> 15:17.698
And especially to mom.

15:17.700 --> 15:20.233
The older she got,
the meaner he got
towards her.

15:20.235 --> 15:22.335
He only got mean
when he drank.

15:22.337 --> 15:23.669
Oh, come on.

15:23.671 --> 15:26.204
He was so bad.

15:26.206 --> 15:30.273
And that's the reason
that I got mom her own
separate burial plot.

15:31.742 --> 15:34.343
Wait a minute,
what do you mean?

15:34.345 --> 15:35.677
Mom already has a burial plot,
it's next to dad.

15:35.679 --> 15:36.778
It's already paid for.

15:36.780 --> 15:38.913
I don't care.

15:38.915 --> 15:41.282
I didn't want her
spending eternity with
that cruel, mean man.

15:41.284 --> 15:43.050
Oh...

15:43.052 --> 15:46.086
I wanted her to rest in peace.
You know what that means?

15:46.088 --> 15:47.420
Yeah, I know
what that mean.

15:47.422 --> 15:48.687
- R.I.P?
- R.I.P., yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:48.689 --> 15:50.422
Yeah.

15:50.424 --> 15:53.057
Well, now you know
if you thought dad
was so fair

15:53.059 --> 15:56.860
And you liked him so much,
why don't you take that plot?

16:00.297 --> 16:02.131
I'll see you tomorrow.

16:08.571 --> 16:09.938
Okay.

16:11.307 --> 16:12.473
Hey, we're here.

16:12.475 --> 16:13.807
Yo, what's she doing here?

16:13.809 --> 16:16.376
Come on, man, leave
her out of this!

16:16.378 --> 16:19.045
Okay, guys, let's get
these computers hooked up

16:19.047 --> 16:20.613
So we can get this
audition tape out, okay?

16:20.615 --> 16:22.581
What, for the
traveling rodeo?
Huh, chip?

16:22.583 --> 16:24.716
No. Have you ever heard
of a band called
the sneaker pimps?

16:24.718 --> 16:26.250
Because I haven't.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.284
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:27.286 --> 16:28.551
Yeah, it's for them.

16:28.553 --> 16:30.152
Sneaker?

16:30.154 --> 16:33.455
Oh, man, here we go.
What's the point, man?

16:33.457 --> 16:36.057
This dude is uptight
all the time.

16:36.059 --> 16:37.758
The chemical brothers
let us go.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.092
The sneaker pimps gonna
do the same thing

16:39.094 --> 16:40.760
With this attitude.

16:40.762 --> 16:42.995
Are you kidding me?
Look at my eye.

16:42.997 --> 16:44.763
You know what? Forget it,
man, I'm out of here.

16:44.765 --> 16:46.264
Yo, if he's out of here,
I'm out of here.

16:46.266 --> 16:48.099
- Let go of me!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:48.101 --> 16:51.802
Hold on one second,
this is not about you guys.

16:51.804 --> 16:56.773
This is about our mother
who lost her mother.

16:56.775 --> 16:58.908
Our grandmother, meemaw.

16:58.910 --> 17:03.411
So you two need to figure out
whatever's going on because

17:03.413 --> 17:07.014
Brotherhood is
really important.

17:07.016 --> 17:08.849
So, cody, you want
to say something--

17:08.851 --> 17:10.584
Wrong, it's logan.

17:10.586 --> 17:12.586
I, I know that.

17:12.588 --> 17:13.787
You're cody or logan?

17:13.789 --> 17:16.322
- I'm cody.
- Yeah.

17:16.324 --> 17:18.857
Just... Just, just
say something to him.

17:18.859 --> 17:20.592
Okay? Do you have anything
you want to say?

17:20.594 --> 17:23.795
I'm sorry

17:23.797 --> 17:26.330
That the chemical brothers
punched you

17:26.332 --> 17:28.898
Instead of me.

17:30.834 --> 17:33.635
And I'm sorry I put
the chemical brothers
in a headlock,

17:33.637 --> 17:35.803
Made them kiss each other,
say "I love you",

17:35.805 --> 17:38.806
Then I bunched
their heads together.

17:38.808 --> 17:43.343
I can't believe we almost
let the chemical brothers
come between us.

17:43.345 --> 17:45.311
They not even real brothers,
but we are.

17:45.313 --> 17:47.546
- I love you.
- I love you.

17:48.781 --> 17:52.382
Makayla? Makayla.
Come here, sis.

17:52.384 --> 17:54.083
I'm sorry.

18:02.892 --> 18:04.692
We shall never
hug like that.

18:04.694 --> 18:06.060
Ditto.

18:07.228 --> 18:10.363
Okay, guys can we
get to disc jockeying?

18:10.365 --> 18:12.031
- Yo man, let's get to djing.
- Yo man, let's get to djing.

18:12.033 --> 18:13.399
- Let's do this.
- Let's do what we do.

18:13.401 --> 18:15.033
- Ah-ha!
- Come on, guys.

18:15.035 --> 18:16.968
Okay guys,

18:16.970 --> 18:19.904

â™ª b-b-b-b basket brothers

19:05.348 --> 19:08.616
Hey, how are you?

19:08.618 --> 19:12.018
I miss her, too.
I miss her, too.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.454
I miss her, too.

19:32.971 --> 19:35.237
And so we meet, then,
to say goodbye

19:35.239 --> 19:39.106
And to reflect upon
the life of esther roosevelt.

19:39.108 --> 19:42.275
A loving mother,

19:42.277 --> 19:45.311
Grandmother and
child of god.

19:45.313 --> 19:46.879
It's okay, mom.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.047
- Now I'll read from the...

19:49.049 --> 19:52.750
Book of revelations.

19:52.752 --> 19:56.720
So I looked and behold,
a pale horse.

19:56.722 --> 19:58.321
How are you doing, sweetie?

19:58.323 --> 20:01.057
And the name of him
who sat on it was death.

20:01.059 --> 20:03.325
You look like Wednesday.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.393
From the addams family.

20:05.395 --> 20:08.129
- It's a good look.
- You look like crap.

20:08.131 --> 20:10.464
Well, I feel worse.

20:10.466 --> 20:12.933
Feel like there's a hurricane
going on inside my stomach.

20:12.935 --> 20:17.337
With death and
the wild beasts of the earth.

20:17.339 --> 20:19.972
I am reading the wrong one.

20:19.974 --> 20:22.341
That one's a little graphic
and I apologize.

20:22.343 --> 20:25.344
I think what I'm trying
to say, ultimately,

20:25.346 --> 20:28.347
Is that she lived
a good life.

20:28.349 --> 20:31.616
So now why don't
we bow our heads

20:31.618 --> 20:34.552
And take a moment of silence.

20:47.963 --> 20:49.596
Give me a break.

20:51.465 --> 20:52.665
Hello?

20:52.667 --> 20:54.600
Hi.

20:54.602 --> 20:56.201
No, it's a good time to talk.

20:59.338 --> 21:03.040
Okay. I can let them know.

21:09.480 --> 21:10.947
Guys.

21:10.949 --> 21:12.782
- What's up, bro?
- The sneaker pimps?

21:12.784 --> 21:13.716
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah?

21:13.718 --> 21:15.617
They saw your video.

21:15.619 --> 21:16.884
- Yeah.
- And they want you
to open for them.

21:16.886 --> 21:18.352
You serious, bro?

21:18.354 --> 21:20.320
Bro, good talking.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.922
Good talking, bro.
You're a lifesaver.

21:26.192 --> 21:30.694
And in his name we pray.
Amen.

21:30.696 --> 21:33.163
Okay, let's put her
down under.

21:35.133 --> 21:37.066
- Mom, it's okay.
- Mom, it's okay.

21:37.068 --> 21:39.567
Sorry.

21:42.203 --> 21:43.736
Where's dale?

21:43.738 --> 21:45.237
Coming, mama.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.841
It's okay.
It's okay.

22:13.864 --> 22:17.099
Whiskey salad, martha:
Apples, oranges,

22:17.101 --> 22:22.504
Raisins, marshmallows,
whiskey. Simple.

22:26.975 --> 22:29.209
And you know what
the key secret is?

22:29.211 --> 22:31.377
One raisin.

22:31.379 --> 22:33.212
- That just does it.
- Really?

22:33.214 --> 22:34.580
I know, it's a fluke.

22:52.298 --> 22:55.133
Chip? Do you know
where the remote is?

22:55.135 --> 22:58.469
-Let me look for it.
-No, that's my foot massage
thing.

22:58.471 --> 23:01.839
-What's this?
-Oh, that's mine.

23:01.841 --> 23:03.574
-Here it is. I got it.
-Got it?

23:03.576 --> 23:06.410
-Yeah.
-Oh, this is the garage door
opener, isn't it?

23:06.412 --> 23:08.845
--where's my hand?

23:08.847 --> 23:10.980
--chimes.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.415
Stop.
Mom!

23:13.417 --> 23:16.184
I can't-- oh, something
is underneath me.
Mom, I'm underneath you!
