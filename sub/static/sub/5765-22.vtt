WEBVTT

00:03.800 --> 00:05.768
Good job, Alicia.

00:05.800 --> 00:09.133
WILL:
Thanks for going
all out this year.

00:09.170 --> 00:10.762
It's been quite a ride.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.630
DIANE:
And we're not out
of the woods yet.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.533
We have a lot
of trimming to do.

00:13.580 --> 00:14.137
So we're all going
to have to work harder.

00:14.180 --> 00:14.930
WILL:
Do more with less.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.572
I'm ready.
DIANE:
We know you are.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.821
You okay?

00:34.860 --> 00:36.794
Yes.

00:36.830 --> 00:39.333
Don't worry, everything's
going to be fine.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.263
Cary, do you
have a minute?

00:42.310 --> 00:44.460
Yes.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.414
You're safe.

00:55.450 --> 00:56.610
I'm safe?

00:56.650 --> 00:58.345
Pink slips are going out.

00:58.390 --> 01:01.416
There's gonna be a lot of blood
in these halls in about an hour.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.674
They fired him.

01:23.710 --> 01:25.678
They kept you?

01:25.710 --> 01:29.885
I got a client last
minute through Peter.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.150
Smart.

01:32.190 --> 01:33.384
No.

01:33.420 --> 01:34.512
You got a client.

01:34.560 --> 01:35.584
Cary would have done
the same thing

01:35.620 --> 01:36.655
if he had that opportunity.

01:36.690 --> 01:37.759
Kalinda, don't.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.296
Do you have your keys?

01:42.330 --> 01:43.297
My...?

01:43.330 --> 01:44.297
Your car keys.

01:44.330 --> 01:45.297
Do you have them?

01:45.330 --> 01:47.434
Why?

01:47.470 --> 01:48.789
I just want to compare them.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.470
Are you trying
to distract me?

01:53.510 --> 01:54.636
Yeah.

01:56.580 --> 01:57.569
Uh, Kalinda?

01:58.510 --> 02:00.717
What are you doing?

02:00.750 --> 02:02.809
You won, he lost.

02:02.850 --> 02:05.216
So you're going to turn
this into some morbid thing

02:05.250 --> 02:06.649
because that's who you are.

02:06.690 --> 02:09.250
So, let's go.

02:12.430 --> 02:13.727
Let me get my bag.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.558
(loud music plays)
KALINDA: It's a
Lockhart/Gardner tradition.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.659
Now you're an associate--

02:18.700 --> 02:21.430
two shots of tequila.

02:21.470 --> 02:23.506
* Yo! You see me burnin' up

02:23.540 --> 02:25.735
* Body hot to the touch,
come on! *

02:25.770 --> 02:27.738
* Partying at the club

02:27.780 --> 02:31.898
* Yo, deejay, turn it up...

02:31.950 --> 02:33.440
(sighs)

02:33.480 --> 02:34.640
Oh.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.511
I have to be
home by 8:00.

02:36.550 --> 02:38.518
Let me see your phone.

02:38.550 --> 02:40.859
No, Kalinda, really,
I have to get home.

02:40.890 --> 02:43.688
Alicia, I'm taking
responsibility

02:43.730 --> 02:44.651
for your irresponsibility.

02:44.690 --> 02:46.191
Let me see your phone.

02:46.230 --> 02:48.528
* ...at every occasion,
big boy ain't a star *

02:48.560 --> 02:50.619
* I'm a constellation
Hmm...

02:50.670 --> 02:53.195
* Keep your hands up, that's my
occupation, so I just need... *

02:53.240 --> 02:55.595
Hi. Uh, who am
I speaking to?

02:55.640 --> 02:58.268
Zach. This is Kalinda.

02:59.310 --> 03:01.403
Sure. One second.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.978
Hey, Dad, Mom's going to be
working late again tonight.

03:05.010 --> 03:05.977
(doorbell ringing)

03:06.010 --> 03:07.739
Tell her not to worry.
Okay.

03:07.780 --> 03:10.487
Yeah, that's fine. Thanks.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.942
You don't look like a man

03:11.990 --> 03:13.617
who's going to be free
in a few days.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.548
There's been a hitch.
Hmm?

03:15.590 --> 03:17.524
Look, I really miss
Daniel Golden.

03:17.560 --> 03:19.494
Well, when the Obama
White House calls,

03:19.530 --> 03:20.428
you got to go.

03:20.460 --> 03:22.496
Golden said she's
the better litigator.

03:22.530 --> 03:24.623
(computer chirping)
It's just easy
to underestimate her.

03:24.670 --> 03:28.788
Well, she must be very,
very good, because I'm
greatly underestimating her.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.638
(computer chirps)
(grunts)

03:31.670 --> 03:33.501
Ms. Tascioni, hi.

03:33.540 --> 03:34.507
Eli Gold.

03:34.540 --> 03:36.474
Oh, yes. Hello.

03:36.510 --> 03:38.000
You're not good with
computers, are you?

03:38.050 --> 03:39.574
My son

03:39.620 --> 03:40.541
keeps buying
me new ones

03:40.580 --> 03:42.480
and then just backing away--
and laughing.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.487
(chuckles)

03:43.520 --> 03:44.509
(chuckles)

03:45.420 --> 03:46.580
So what are we watching?

03:46.620 --> 03:47.587
Evidence.

03:47.620 --> 03:48.655
For the retrial?

03:48.690 --> 03:49.657
Yep.
(computer chirps)

03:49.690 --> 03:52.625
But the prosecution lost
its only witness, right?

03:52.660 --> 03:54.525
Kozko committed suicide,
so they don't have a case.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.427
And I thought Monday would be
a simple matter of a dismissal,

03:57.470 --> 03:58.562
but watch.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.692
(computer chirps)

03:59.740 --> 04:00.695
(groans)

04:02.670 --> 04:04.729
(computer chirps)

04:04.770 --> 04:07.273
(computer beeps)
GLENN:
Prosecution interview B-3:

04:07.310 --> 04:09.642
People v. Peter Florrick.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.705
Peter was pretty bald about it.

04:11.750 --> 04:15.311
Uh, $45,000 would buy you
a certain amount of access.

04:15.350 --> 04:18.342
$85,000-- more.

04:18.390 --> 04:20.608
GLENN: Did he say what he
needed the money for?

04:20.660 --> 04:22.958
KOZKO: A down payment
on a bigger house.

04:22.990 --> 04:25.652
This is a video proffer
completed by Mr. Kozko

04:25.690 --> 04:26.850
before his death.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.368
The prosecution now plans
to introduce it into evidence.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.765
But they can't,
because it's hearsay.

04:30.800 --> 04:31.869
That's right.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.731
And they don't
want to use it.

04:33.770 --> 04:35.328
They want the press
to use it.

04:35.370 --> 04:37.008
Well, that was my first guess,

04:37.040 --> 04:39.929
but these aren't the _motions
of a prosecution wrndlng down.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.471
KOZKO:
Peter promised me an ear,

04:42.510 --> 04:44.944
and he also promised me
his friendship.

04:44.980 --> 04:48.438
(dance music plays)

04:48.480 --> 04:51.517
MAN:
Come on, everybody, join the
happy couple on the dance floor.

04:51.550 --> 04:53.359
Let go...

04:53.390 --> 04:54.482
No.

04:54.520 --> 04:57.819
(both laughing)

04:57.860 --> 05:00.021
You know, Will feels
the same way about you.

05:00.060 --> 05:01.891
No, he doesn't.

05:01.930 --> 05:04.694
And even if he did,
it doesn't matter.

05:04.730 --> 05:06.061
It does.

05:07.470 --> 05:10.803
I phone Will,
I tell him we're in a bar

05:10.840 --> 05:13.377
and that you're too drunk
to go home.

05:13.410 --> 05:16.379
So you're getting
a hotel room upstairs.

05:16.410 --> 05:19.868
Alicia, one night--
no repercussions.

05:19.920 --> 05:20.944
And tomorrow?

05:20.980 --> 05:22.072
Tomorrow you wake up.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.610
(chuckles)

05:23.650 --> 05:25.379
That's just not me, Kalinda.

05:25.420 --> 05:26.580
Everything
is you.

05:26.620 --> 05:29.555
Everything you want
to be you is you.

05:29.590 --> 05:31.581
You two are so hot.

05:31.630 --> 05:34.394
(both laughing)

05:35.900 --> 05:38.721
And, um...

05:38.770 --> 05:40.590
You-you are?

05:40.640 --> 05:42.460
Brian. I'm the best man.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.728
What are you celebrating?

05:44.770 --> 05:47.807
Tomorrow her husband is being
freed from house arrest.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.774
Really?

05:49.810 --> 05:53.746
All right, uh, well, I'm
getting you both drinks.

05:53.780 --> 05:55.145
Yeah.

05:55.180 --> 05:57.080
(snickering)

06:01.160 --> 06:02.855
Are you gay?

06:06.060 --> 06:08.392
Oh, come on.

06:08.430 --> 06:12.469
We are talking about every
single little detail of my life.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.388
It's a simple question.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.806
I'm...

06:16.840 --> 06:18.831
I'm private.

06:18.870 --> 06:21.532
Ugh. Come on.

06:21.580 --> 06:22.740
What does it matter?

06:22.780 --> 06:24.179
It doesn't.

06:24.210 --> 06:25.848
Then why'd you want to know?
Because I do.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.178
And how is this fair?

06:28.220 --> 06:29.710
I talk about everything.

06:29.750 --> 06:30.887
I didn't say it was.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.514
You like to talk
about your life.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.551
I don't like to talk about mine.

06:35.590 --> 06:37.922
(cell phone ringing)

06:37.960 --> 06:39.825
What?
Nothing.

06:39.860 --> 06:41.851
It's work.

06:49.810 --> 06:50.936
Hi. It's me.

06:50.970 --> 06:53.575
Yes. I know. Hi.

06:53.610 --> 06:55.100
How you doing?

06:55.140 --> 06:57.142
Good, actually.

06:57.180 --> 06:58.670
Really good.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.143
I'm glad. You deserve it.

07:00.180 --> 07:01.670
Um, how about you?

07:01.720 --> 07:04.644
Well, we're in the midst
of layoffs.

07:05.690 --> 07:07.954
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

07:07.990 --> 07:10.788
No, no. It just has to be done.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.889
Alicia, I...

07:15.900 --> 07:17.868
You...?

07:17.900 --> 07:20.494
I, um...

07:20.540 --> 07:22.132
Can I ask you a favor?

07:22.170 --> 07:25.867
I just got a call
from a client who needs help,

07:25.910 --> 07:29.539
but I can't get away right now.

07:29.580 --> 07:32.071
Oh, um, yeah, of course.

07:32.110 --> 07:34.044
Which client?

07:34.080 --> 07:35.775
Colin Sweeney.

07:35.820 --> 07:38.539
I know. Look, it'll be easy.

07:38.590 --> 07:40.751
We just revamp the language
on his company merger.

07:40.790 --> 07:43.918
I'm sure he just wants to ask
a few questions before he signs.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.587
I was gonna send Brad, but

07:45.630 --> 07:47.552
we just let him go.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.158
Oh, God. No, of course.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.191
Um, it's-it's close to here.

07:51.230 --> 07:52.788
Thanks.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.229
Don't leave without
a fully-executed copy, okay?

07:55.270 --> 07:58.137
This merger is very important
to the firm.

07:58.170 --> 08:00.172
(sighs)

08:01.710 --> 08:03.075
Thanks.

08:03.110 --> 08:04.941
I'm really glad this worked out.

08:04.980 --> 08:07.642
Yeah. Me, too. Bye.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.924
Just give me a minute.

08:20.730 --> 08:22.789
(doorbell chimes)

08:22.830 --> 08:25.594
SWEENEY (over intercom):
Yes. Who's there?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.564
Mr. Sweeney,
it's Alicia Florrick.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.261
Will Gardner sent me.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.801
Uh... (laughs)

08:30.840 --> 08:32.603
Uh, sure, come on up.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.232
(buzzer sounds)

08:37.180 --> 08:38.147
(door bangs shut)

08:38.180 --> 08:40.171
Mr. Sweeney?

08:46.190 --> 08:48.158
Mr. Sweeney?

08:48.190 --> 08:50.158
SWEENEY:
Uh, in the study.

08:50.190 --> 08:53.956
Uh, could you grab the camera
on the table, please, dear?

08:55.200 --> 08:56.997
I have a cab waiting,
Mr. Sweeney.

08:57.030 --> 08:59.931
Will Gardner said
you'd have a...

08:59.970 --> 09:02.859
red-lined contract waiting
for me.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.981
I can explain.

09:20.690 --> 09:24.649
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

09:38.870 --> 09:40.701
SWEENEY:
This...

09:40.740 --> 09:43.140
This is not what
it looks like.

09:44.980 --> 09:47.119
Oh, oh, yeah,
the camera. Yes.

09:47.150 --> 09:49.710
Um, I...

09:49.750 --> 09:50.819
Could you?

09:50.850 --> 09:53.057
I can't reach.

09:54.290 --> 09:55.757
I already
phoned 911

09:55.790 --> 09:56.825
a minute ago.

09:56.860 --> 09:58.828
Is she dead?

09:58.860 --> 10:00.851
Sheila? Yeah.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.663
It was
self-defense.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.065
You have to
believe that.

10:04.100 --> 10:06.125
She attacked me.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.092
Uh, sorry. I just...

10:08.140 --> 10:10.005
Mr. Sweeney, stop!

10:11.910 --> 10:13.878
Kalinda, there's been...

10:13.910 --> 10:15.707
I need your help

10:15.740 --> 10:16.707
at Colin Sweeney's.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.069
There's been a murder.

10:18.110 --> 10:20.419
No. I don't know.

10:20.450 --> 10:23.647
Um, I didn't know it was a crime
scene, and my fingerprints

10:23.690 --> 10:26.215
are on... Mr. Sweeney, don't!

10:26.250 --> 10:28.650
They were just so embarrassing.

10:28.690 --> 10:29.987
The pictures.
Put the camera down.

10:30.030 --> 10:33.750
As soon as you can. Thanks.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.756
Don't move!

10:35.800 --> 10:38.223
(clattering)

10:44.740 --> 10:45.968
Hello?

10:46.010 --> 10:47.136
What's wrong?

10:47.180 --> 10:48.374
Is someone else here?

10:48.410 --> 10:49.946
No. Why?

11:02.460 --> 11:05.179
(distant siren wailing)
SWEENEY: Here comes the cavalry!

11:12.970 --> 11:15.438
(siren approaching)

11:15.470 --> 11:17.233
He never hurt anyone.

11:17.270 --> 11:20.728
Chili-- he barely even barked.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.304
So you're saying she killed
your dog?

11:22.340 --> 11:23.978
Even though
the victim has

11:24.010 --> 11:26.001
no defensive wounds on her body
from a canine attack.

11:26.050 --> 11:30.840
Mr. Sweeney is choosing not to
answer at this time, Detective.

11:30.890 --> 11:31.811
Mrs. Florrick,

11:31.850 --> 11:33.909
you said that your
fingerprints were on, uh...

11:33.960 --> 11:36.986
On the doorbell,
on the entering doorknob,

11:37.030 --> 11:38.725
on the banister...

11:40.160 --> 11:42.196
On the camera.

11:42.230 --> 11:43.822
He opened the back
of the camera?

11:43.870 --> 11:46.225
I can't answer that, due to
attorney-client privilege.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.191
But your fingerprints
are on the camera?

11:47.240 --> 11:49.162
Yes, as I said.
So you're still
insisting

11:49.200 --> 11:50.838
that you didn't tamper
with evidence?

11:50.870 --> 11:52.064
Yes.
Even though

11:52.110 --> 11:53.202
I smell alcohol
on your breath?

11:53.240 --> 11:54.832
Tony...

11:54.880 --> 11:57.269
This is my job, Ms. Sharma.

11:57.310 --> 11:59.107
I don't interfere with your job.

11:59.150 --> 12:01.072
We were celebrating
when I received

12:01.120 --> 12:03.145
a phone call
from Mr. Sweeney.

12:03.190 --> 12:07.251
Excuse me. From Mr. Gardner...

12:07.290 --> 12:08.951
a partner at my firm.

12:08.990 --> 12:11.049
He told me to come here
to collect contracts.

12:11.090 --> 12:12.125
I arrived by cab.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.390
I did not
drive myself.

12:16.100 --> 12:19.228
You're under arrest for murder,
Mr. Sweeney.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.208
Back in the cuffs I go.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.264
Listen to me,
Mr. Sweeney.

12:25.310 --> 12:26.402
Remain silent.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.271
Irony does not work here.

12:28.310 --> 12:29.777
Jokes don't work.

12:29.810 --> 12:30.572
Do you understand?

12:30.610 --> 12:32.168
You have the right
to remain silent.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.815
Anything you say
can and will be used

12:34.850 --> 12:36.169
against you in
a court of law.

12:36.220 --> 12:38.484
BAILIFF:
All rise!

12:38.520 --> 12:40.283
The Honorable Graham Schickel
presrdlng.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.548
SCHICKEL:
Good morning.

12:41.590 --> 12:45.321
As the youngest justice on the
bench in the state of Illinois,

12:45.360 --> 12:47.419
I would like to say welcome.

12:47.460 --> 12:50.896
And I believe you have a motion,
Mr. State's Attorney?

12:50.930 --> 12:52.261
I do, Your Honor.

12:52.300 --> 12:54.996
We move to introduce into
eVIdence the VIdeo proffer

12:55.040 --> 12:56.962
made by our key witness
Gerald Kozco,

12:57.010 --> 12:58.136
recently deceased.

12:58.170 --> 12:59.979
Yes, Your Honor. Hi.

13:00.010 --> 13:01.534
Um, I hate
to object

13:01.580 --> 13:04.799
right off the bat here, but, uh,
the key word here is "deceased."

13:04.850 --> 13:07.569
Mr. Florrick has a right
to challenge his accuser.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.417
I can't cross-examine
a dead wrtness,

13:09.450 --> 13:11.281
as much as I'd like to try.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.254
GLENN: Uh, your Honor,
two years ago,

13:13.290 --> 13:17.283
Illinois legislature,
in a 109-to-0 vote,

13:17.330 --> 13:19.321
passed the Peterson Law,
which makes us

13:19.360 --> 13:21.157
the only state in the union

13:21.200 --> 13:24.966
which allows hearsay evidence--
such as this proffer-- when

13:25.000 --> 13:26.399
the accused benefits
from the death.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.193
Ah, getting novel on us,
Mr. Childs.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.299
This law is almost as new
as I am.

13:30.340 --> 13:32.331
(chuckles) Yes, Your Honor,

13:32.370 --> 13:34.304
but unfortunately
for Mr. Childs,

13:34.340 --> 13:36.479
the Peterson Law requires
the accused benefit

13:36.510 --> 13:40.048
not just from a death,
but from a murder he committed.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.172
And Mr. Kozco committed suicide.

13:41.220 --> 13:43.586
The police have not made
that determination, Your Honor.

13:43.620 --> 13:44.541
No body has been found yet,

13:44.590 --> 13:46.319
and we will present evidence
to the contrary.

13:46.350 --> 13:49.285
(laughs)

13:49.320 --> 13:50.423
My apologies, Your Honor.

13:50.460 --> 13:52.951
I'm sorry.
I found that humorous.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.150
Mr. Childs would like
to prove my client

13:55.200 --> 13:58.067
is a murderer, so he can
prosecute him for corruption?

13:58.100 --> 13:59.294
Well, that is certainly novel.

13:59.330 --> 14:02.493
Well, novel or not,

14:02.540 --> 14:05.509
we will hear evidence on this
alleged murder tomorrow.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.405
(gavel raps)

14:13.150 --> 14:15.345
(indistinct conversation)

14:19.990 --> 14:24.120
Guys in the Bureau might
want to keep track of
Mr. Florrick...

14:26.260 --> 14:29.127
Yes, he's talking
with the Feds.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.367
I think things
just got more serious.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.288
Coordinating strategy?

14:33.340 --> 14:35.092
I don't know.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.233
(Glenn speaking indistinctly)

14:37.270 --> 14:41.138
Hi. Are you two coordinating
strategy?

14:41.180 --> 14:44.399
Mr. Childs and I are
old friends.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.600
(sighs) What a relief.

14:49.380 --> 14:50.916
SWEENEY:
She would ambush me.

14:50.950 --> 14:51.939
I'd fight.

14:51.990 --> 14:53.981
And if I won,
we'd have sex.

14:54.020 --> 14:56.557
DIANE: She was your stalker,
but you encouraged her?

14:56.590 --> 14:57.625
It was a game.

14:57.660 --> 15:00.424
She'd break in,
I would disarm her,

15:00.460 --> 15:02.052
we'd have sex.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.328
It was terrific.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.167
This time, it
was different.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.667
This time, she tried to kill me.

15:07.700 --> 15:10.407
The police are calling
the victim a Jane Doe.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.533
Do you have any idea
who she was?

15:12.570 --> 15:14.538
No. I just knew her
as Sheila Penn.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.638
You said she wrote you?

15:15.680 --> 15:18.274
Yes, classic stalker letters.

15:18.310 --> 15:19.470
Where are they?

15:19.510 --> 15:21.011
In his bedside table,

15:21.050 --> 15:22.574
which means the police
already have it.

15:22.620 --> 15:25.111
Let's petition the court
for access to these letters.

15:25.150 --> 15:26.447
When do we get forensics,
blood work?

15:26.490 --> 15:28.412
ALICIA:
Preliminary, three days.

15:28.460 --> 15:29.552
We should get an expedited

15:29.590 --> 15:31.182
necropsy on the dog.
I think

15:31.230 --> 15:32.185
that's a cul-de-sac.

15:32.230 --> 15:33.356
Preliminary M.E. report

15:33.400 --> 15:34.219
shows no defensive wounds

15:34.260 --> 15:36.251
on the _victim
from a canine attack.

15:36.300 --> 15:37.699
Yes, but Sweeney said

15:37.730 --> 15:40.437
he heard no barking at all
when the Jane Doe broke in.

15:40.470 --> 15:43.030
So maybe the attacker
sedated the dog first.

15:43.070 --> 15:45.209
That would show up
in a necropsy.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.229
And if we can prove

15:46.270 --> 15:48.135
Jane Doe sedated the dog,
it's premeditation;

15:48.180 --> 15:50.000
she went there with the purpose
of doing harm.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.699
Good, it's a place to start.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.547
Get the letters and get the dog.

15:53.580 --> 15:56.219
Alicia, do you
have a second?

15:56.250 --> 15:57.182
I'm sorry.

15:57.220 --> 15:59.541
I didn't know.
I thought It was contracts.

15:59.590 --> 16:01.387
I never would've sent you there.

16:01.420 --> 16:03.081
Will, really, it's fine.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.427
How are you handling it?

16:05.330 --> 16:07.025
The body, the blood.

16:07.060 --> 16:08.459
Oh.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.455
Good.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.422
I didn't really think about it.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.631
(laughs)

16:13.670 --> 16:16.491
What a weird life
we lead, huh?

16:18.170 --> 16:20.479
So, are we normal again,
are we dealing with it?

16:20.510 --> 16:23.445
We talking about
the crime scene now?

16:23.480 --> 16:25.175
No.

16:26.380 --> 16:29.474
Yes, we're
dealing with it.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.511
Well, welcome back.

16:34.220 --> 16:35.414
Talk about
the luck of Job.

16:35.460 --> 16:36.688
On the brink

16:36.720 --> 16:38.620
of merging Sweeney's
company with another one,

16:38.660 --> 16:40.594
this happens.
The merger's not
off-track yet.

16:40.630 --> 16:42.518
I'm phoning to check
everybody's temperature.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.460
The CEO was just
accused of murder.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.728
Everybody'll scramble.

16:45.770 --> 16:48.659
Not necessarily.
The buyer's motivated,
and money is money.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.167
What's that about?

16:52.210 --> 16:53.507
Oh, the layoffs.

16:53.540 --> 16:55.770
Yes. Won't be a fun day.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.441
Cary...

17:05.490 --> 17:08.186
I'm just getting my laptop.

17:08.220 --> 17:10.529
I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.687
Sorry you got the job,

17:12.730 --> 17:15.392
or sorry for what you did
to get the job?

17:15.430 --> 17:18.695
Sorry we both
didn't get the job.

17:19.730 --> 17:21.391
Alicia, here's the thing...

17:21.440 --> 17:23.431
You like to think
you're a good person,

17:23.470 --> 17:25.461
and maybe at one time you were,

17:25.510 --> 17:27.171
but we both know

17:27.210 --> 17:28.529
you'll do whatever it takes.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.276
Sleeping with the boss?

17:31.310 --> 17:32.709
Check.
Cary, if it makes you

17:32.750 --> 17:36.743
feel better to think that,
then think it, but...
I don't have a name,

17:36.780 --> 17:39.544
Alicia, I don't have
a fairy godmother I can phone up

17:39.590 --> 17:40.716
or the whole Chicago
political machine.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.627
I had to work,
I had to sweat,
I had to make money

17:43.660 --> 17:46.288
for this firm,
and that's just not enough.

17:46.330 --> 17:47.627
Sir, you have
to leave.

17:47.660 --> 17:50.458
I need my laptop
and my personal items.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.298
You can itemize them,
and they will be
collected and sent

17:53.340 --> 17:54.796
to your home.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.489
I need them now.

17:56.540 --> 17:57.859
That's not
pOSSIble, Sir.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.731
They'll be returned to you
within three working days.

18:05.410 --> 18:07.344
(quietly):
This was not fair.

18:07.380 --> 18:10.213
And I was stupid--
I acted like it would be.

18:15.190 --> 18:17.351
ALICIA:
So, these letters
were sent to Sweeney?

18:17.390 --> 18:20.689
KALINDA:
Yeah. Sweeney's at least telling
the truth about being stalked.

18:20.730 --> 18:22.652
"You're dead meat, my darling.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.827
I feast on dead meat."

18:24.870 --> 18:26.497
Is she still a Jane Doe?

18:26.530 --> 18:27.565
Yep.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.568
What?

18:29.600 --> 18:31.534
You know what's odd?

18:31.570 --> 18:34.368
These letters are filled
with details from his trial.

18:34.410 --> 18:36.173
AL_ICIA:
A juror?

18:36.210 --> 18:38.303
KALINDA: It's the legal
language she uses.

18:38.350 --> 18:40.375
"I want to kill
that idiot deponent."

18:40.420 --> 18:42.513
"I hate the Rule 30 slut."

18:42.550 --> 18:45.610
It's like someone
In the busrness.

18:52.530 --> 18:55.556
KALINDA:
These are from the first trial.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.322
Who's this?

18:59.370 --> 19:00.667
Court reporter.

19:00.700 --> 19:02.565
Yeah.

19:06.970 --> 19:09.302
That could be her.

19:09.340 --> 19:10.568
Yeah.

19:10.610 --> 19:12.840
What's her name?

19:32.970 --> 19:35.859
(dog barking in distance)

19:59.890 --> 20:02.256
*

20:16.580 --> 20:20.573
Burton, get ready
to write down an address.

20:22.650 --> 20:24.413
Not to sound too melodramatic,
Your Honor,

20:24.450 --> 20:25.815
but objection. Really.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.488
Your Honor, Mrs. Kozko

20:27.520 --> 20:28.612
heard directly
from her husband

20:28.660 --> 20:31.254
that if he were to die
under mysterious Circumstances

20:31.290 --> 20:32.826
that it would be at
Peter Florrick's hand.

20:32.860 --> 20:34.999
Yes, and I heard from
a butterfly it wouldn't be.

20:35.030 --> 20:36.827
Both are hearsay
statements,

20:36.860 --> 20:38.566
Your Honor,
and equally inadmissible.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.660
The Peterson Law allows
for exactly

20:41.700 --> 20:42.962
such hearsay testimony.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.662
So let me get this
straight-- it allows

20:45.710 --> 20:47.871
for hearsay as long
as a murder is established.

20:47.910 --> 20:49.309
And a murder is established here

20:49.340 --> 20:50.546
because there's
a hearsay statement

20:50.580 --> 20:52.548
that establishes it--
I mean, tell me when

20:52.580 --> 20:54.878
the snake actually
devours its tail, okay?

20:54.920 --> 20:57.718
Ms. Tascioni, you're ridiculing
established Illinois law.

20:57.750 --> 20:58.648
Yes, Your Honor, gleefully.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.885
Well, I know I'm the,
uh, youngest judge

21:00.920 --> 21:02.785
on the bench, but...
Yes, Your Honor,

21:02.820 --> 21:04.685
we're all in awe.

21:07.330 --> 21:09.890
...but I will ov_errule
your objection.

21:09.930 --> 21:12.865
Given the Peterson Law,
this testimony is allowed.

21:12.900 --> 21:16.267
If you have a problem with
that, you can take it up
with the Supreme Court.

21:26.950 --> 21:30.784
Okay. Now I get to work.

21:30.820 --> 21:32.583
Hybristophiliac.

21:32.620 --> 21:35.589
Women who are irresistibly
attracted to dangerous men.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.588
It's quite common.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.621
Women who propose
to Charlie Manson

21:39.660 --> 21:41.799
or send their panties
to Jeffrey Dahmer.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.924
45 years.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.619
No.

21:46.670 --> 21:48.467
See you in court.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.663
Fine. This isn't gangbanger
number five, Ms. Lockhart;

21:51.710 --> 21:53.029
this is Colin Sweeney.

21:53.070 --> 21:54.879
People want him behind bars.

21:54.910 --> 21:56.537
Then people should find
better evidence,

21:56.580 --> 21:59.003
because this screams
self-defense, ma'am.

21:59.050 --> 22:01.871
The thing is...

22:01.920 --> 22:04.844
these letters didn't
just go one way.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.087
How's Peter doing?

22:10.930 --> 22:13.421
Fine... thank you.

22:13.460 --> 22:15.052
JULIUS:
Where'd you get these?

22:15.100 --> 22:16.294
The victim's house.

22:16.330 --> 22:20.460
You see, Mr. Sweeney wrote back,
encouraging her, taunting her.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.865
I'm sure you can ﬁnd

22:21.900 --> 22:23.765
a psychological term
for that, too.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.698
Hysterical prosecution?

22:25.740 --> 22:28.732
45 years.

22:28.780 --> 22:31.476
Here is a copy
of the victim's diary

22:31.510 --> 22:33.546
_ with some _
very Interesting entries

22:33.580 --> 22:35.878
on your client,
and some quite specific

22:35.920 --> 22:38.787
descriptions
of their sexual practices.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.458
So, this is you?

22:48.500 --> 22:50.468
This is me?

22:50.500 --> 22:52.559
Milking it?

22:52.600 --> 22:54.966
The wife of Peter Florrick
representing a killer.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.490
Interesting.

22:56.540 --> 22:57.962
I hadn't considered that.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.966
Well, what about this?

23:00.010 --> 23:03.070
The state's attorney
hired a sick,

23:03.110 --> 23:04.839
killer-obsessed court reporter

23:04.880 --> 23:07.849
for some of the state's most
high-profile criminal cases.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.711
Now that will be a fun lawsuit.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.579
Well, you got me there,
Mrs. Florrick.

23:15.020 --> 23:17.727
So, let's try this.

23:17.760 --> 23:20.695
Why don't we both just
do our jobs?

23:25.470 --> 23:27.529
(scoffs)
Of course I wrote back.

23:27.570 --> 23:29.538
I love a good fetish.

23:29.570 --> 23:31.106
Cut the crap, Mr. Sweeney.

23:31.140 --> 23:33.108
You're looking at 45 years.

23:33.140 --> 23:35.108
You're right.

23:35.140 --> 23:36.607
I'm sorry.

23:37.850 --> 23:40.000
Please take a look at
the diary, Mr. Sweeney.

23:41.780 --> 23:43.042
(sighs)

23:43.080 --> 23:46.709
Sheila... Warburg?

23:46.750 --> 23:50.083
My God,
how prosaic.

23:50.120 --> 23:53.157
Sweaty suburban sex
with Sheila Warburg.

23:53.190 --> 23:54.999
JULIUS:
We need to figure out

23:55.030 --> 23:57.225
what's true
and what she made up.

23:57.260 --> 24:00.195
Well, this is not true.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.766
This one here.

24:01.800 --> 24:04.007
I'm not opposed to it
in principle.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.530
(laughing):
But my goodness.

24:05.570 --> 24:06.867
DIANE:
If you could underline

24:06.910 --> 24:08.002
the parts that are fiction?

24:08.040 --> 24:10.600
Certainly.

24:12.150 --> 24:14.141
Look”.

24:14.180 --> 24:17.047
I had sex with her twice.

24:17.080 --> 24:20.755
She liked to pretend to break in
and handcuff me.

24:20.790 --> 24:22.951
We would wrestle,
then we'd have sex.

24:22.990 --> 24:24.958
But this time,

24:24.990 --> 24:26.821
she wouldn't stop.

24:26.860 --> 24:30.193
I tried to get her
to drop the knife, but...

24:30.230 --> 24:32.164
Then we-we struggled,

24:32.200 --> 24:34.236
and-and the knife...

24:37.300 --> 24:39.507
...it went in.

24:41.140 --> 24:42.835
That's it.

24:52.590 --> 24:54.012
Okay, we'll get back to you.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.517
Right. I have to go.
Give me a few hours.

24:56.560 --> 24:57.720
(sighs)

24:57.760 --> 24:59.751
Julius!

25:02.830 --> 25:04.092
The merger's on.

25:04.130 --> 25:05.666
If anything,
Mr. Sweeney's troubles

25:05.700 --> 25:07.964
have shored up
the buyer's interest.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.264
They were scared
of his volatility.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.109
Meaning?

25:12.140 --> 25:15.769
Well, we're not changing
our defense strategy, but...

25:15.810 --> 25:17.107
It would

25:17.140 --> 25:20.075
benefit us
if Mr. Sweeney took a plea?

25:23.320 --> 25:25.311
Okay, we can't say that,

25:25.350 --> 25:28.285
but I'm backing away
from Mr. Sweeney's defense.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.753
A Chinese Wall.

25:29.790 --> 25:32.782
You and Alicia continue,
and we'll say no more.

25:32.830 --> 25:34.957
Make any deal you can,
defend him any way you can.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.150
We won't talk to you,
you won't talk to us. Okay?

25:39.630 --> 25:42.030
Got it.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.109
(door opens and closes)

25:44.140 --> 25:46.608
Are you dancing a jig inside?

25:46.640 --> 25:48.278
Like Rose on the Titanic.

25:48.310 --> 25:49.868
(laughs)

25:55.220 --> 25:57.211
(sighs)

26:04.660 --> 26:06.753
MAN:
Cary Agos!

26:06.790 --> 26:08.690
Marty.

26:08.730 --> 26:10.322
You work here?
Uh, no.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.067
Trying to. I thought you
were at Lockhart/Gardner.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.965
Yeah. I was. Layoffs.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.137
Oh, my God.

26:16.170 --> 26:17.296
Same at Orren & Polk.

26:17.340 --> 26:19.137
And I wouldn't
even go In here.

26:19.170 --> 26:21.070
They're just lining up
resumes for 2011.

26:21.110 --> 26:22.907
Come on, let's
go get a drink.

26:22.940 --> 26:25.647
Ah, maybe I'll give it a try.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.671
You don't believe me?

26:27.720 --> 26:29.176
Well, go for it.

26:29.220 --> 26:30.778
Hey, did you hear
about Corsican?

26:33.020 --> 26:36.057
Now he's writing
a screenplay.

26:36.090 --> 26:37.216
About what?

26:37.260 --> 26:39.285
(laughs):
Who cares?

26:39.330 --> 26:41.298
Hey, so, if you change your
mind, some of the old buds

26:41.330 --> 26:44.265
are getting together at
Brandos, all right? Drop by.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.209
Okay, get them
to his desk today,

26:52.240 --> 26:53.798
and I will meet you there.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.705
The FBI doesn't give
you much space, does it?

26:55.740 --> 26:57.844
This is the size of my
old college dorm room.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.747
Were you visiting someone else
in the building, Mr. Gold?

27:00.780 --> 27:04.011
I was, but I thought
I'd make a little detour.

27:04.050 --> 27:06.086
I can't talk about any
ongoing investigations.

27:06.120 --> 27:08.054
Oh, I didn't
think you could.

27:08.090 --> 27:09.216
I thought I'd talk about 'em.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.182
Oh, knock yourself out.

27:11.230 --> 27:14.051
Glenn Childs has it out
for my client.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.022
It is a politically-motivated
prosecution,

27:16.060 --> 27:19.268
and the FBI should not be
in the business of taking sides.

27:19.300 --> 27:22.929
You are reading too much
into my visit with Mr. Childs.

27:22.970 --> 27:24.699
He is giving you evidence
against Florrick.

27:24.740 --> 27:26.298
He is suggesting
that Florrick

27:26.340 --> 27:28.308
is responsible
for Kozko's death.

27:28.340 --> 27:30.376
And you're buying it.

27:32.280 --> 27:35.875
Well, you know your secret
investigation of my client--

27:35.920 --> 27:37.842
it's no longer a secret.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.881
I've seen this.

27:39.920 --> 27:43.219
I know you have,
but you haven't seen it...

27:43.260 --> 27:45.251
on the side of a bus.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.850
And I had it made
into buttons.

27:49.900 --> 27:53.222
One for each of the reporters
visiting the court.

27:53.270 --> 27:55.067
And...

27:55.100 --> 27:56.897
coffee mugs.

27:56.940 --> 27:58.362
And this

27:58.410 --> 28:01.470
is a little mouse pad,
just for you.

28:01.510 --> 28:04.206
You think this will scare us,
Mr. Gold?

28:04.250 --> 28:06.206
The office that
took down Capone?

28:06.250 --> 28:07.478
Really?

28:07.510 --> 28:09.774
Oh, I know

28:09.820 --> 28:13.119
how the FBI works... ma'am.

28:13.150 --> 28:15.414
You don't like
to hunt for new game.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.724
You'd rather take down
an already bleeding deer,

28:17.760 --> 28:20.081
because you want to look good
for your superiors.

28:20.130 --> 28:23.099
Well, this is just to say
that we are not bleeding.

28:23.130 --> 28:26.122
We have a lot of fight
left in us yet.

28:26.170 --> 28:28.695
So go find some new game.

28:33.540 --> 28:34.871
KALINDA:
We need to talk.

28:34.910 --> 28:36.036
That doesn't
sound good.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.479
It's Sweeney.
When is it ever good?

28:37.510 --> 28:39.341
I got the results
of the dog necropsy.

28:39.380 --> 28:40.506
No drugs in Chili?

28:40.550 --> 28:42.313
That's not all.

28:42.350 --> 28:45.012
There was blood on the dog's
fur from the victim.

28:45.050 --> 28:46.483
Makes sense.

28:46.520 --> 28:47.851
Blood when she broke in.

28:47.890 --> 28:49.357
No, she didn't cut herself
from breaking in.

28:49.390 --> 28:50.982
It's from the struggle.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.850
It... It can't be.

28:52.890 --> 28:54.824
She wasn't alive after
the struggle.
Right.

28:54.860 --> 28:57.397
And there was also blood
from Sweeney. And these.

28:57.430 --> 28:59.159
Hesitation knife wounds,

28:59.200 --> 29:01.395
with a tentative
angling of the knife.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.000
Someone hesitated
before they killed the dog?

29:04.040 --> 29:05.302
Yep.

29:05.340 --> 29:06.432
The dog's owner?

29:10.280 --> 29:12.271
Hardest thing I've ever done.

29:12.310 --> 29:13.447
He was so innocent.

29:13.480 --> 29:14.412
You did it?

29:14.450 --> 29:16.008
You actually
killed your dog?

29:16.050 --> 29:17.312
(sniffling)

29:20.050 --> 29:21.859
Who was going to believe me?

29:21.890 --> 29:24.950
Not a soul.
You don't.

29:24.990 --> 29:26.127
I panicked.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.128
I-I thought if the police saw

29:28.160 --> 29:29.491
she killed my dog, they'd see...

29:29.530 --> 29:31.293
JULIUS:
Mr. Sweeney,

29:31.330 --> 29:33.491
we're gonna have to talk
about taking a plea.

29:33.530 --> 29:36.397
Maybe we can talk them
down to 30 years.

29:36.440 --> 29:37.907
(scoffs)

29:37.940 --> 29:39.066
I didn't do this.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.304
ALICIA:_
Just stop It.

29:40.340 --> 29:42.274
Mr. Sweeney, stop it.
You killed your dog.

29:42.310 --> 29:45.404
Yeah, but this lady tried
to kill me.

29:45.450 --> 29:46.405
I was

29:46.450 --> 29:48.372
protecting myself.

29:48.420 --> 29:49.842
Oh, my God.

29:49.880 --> 29:52.189
JULIUS:
We'll try to make

29:52.220 --> 29:54.154
the best deal
we can, Mr. Sweeney.

29:56.260 --> 29:59.081
MARTY:
You used to drop the H-bomb,
people would look up,

29:59.130 --> 30:00.859
put your resume on the top.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.289
Now everybody's, "Ah, so what?

30:03.330 --> 30:04.467
Harvard grad."

30:04.500 --> 30:06.229
Hey, look--
Justice Hart.

30:07.570 --> 30:09.094
MARTY:
No, he's already
staffed up.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.266
CARY:
So you guys

30:10.300 --> 30:12.063
just drink here,
trying to get a job?

30:12.110 --> 30:13.930
You make it sound so sad.
Yeah.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.005
We're absorbing legal culture.

30:17.180 --> 30:19.307
Thanks, guys.
Glenn Childs, six o'clock.

30:20.380 --> 30:21.449
MARTY:
Huh. Right.

30:21.480 --> 30:24.347
_When I want to make
a first-year teacher's salary.

30:26.540 --> 30:26.590
Well, they're not hiring,
anyway.

30:26.590 --> 30:29.184
So, Cary, you're the
last one working.

30:29.220 --> 30:30.482
What's your
severance?

30:30.520 --> 30:32.351
My severance? I don't know.

30:32.390 --> 30:34.028
Oh, you'll find out.

30:34.060 --> 30:35.891
Last one working pays.

30:37.430 --> 30:39.022
All right.

30:43.540 --> 30:46.509
(slow jazz playing)

30:46.540 --> 30:49.600
Have you read Outliers
by Malcolm Gladwell?

30:49.640 --> 30:51.870
Excuse me?

30:51.910 --> 30:53.946
The book.

30:53.980 --> 30:55.572
Outliers by
Malcolm Gladwell.

30:55.620 --> 30:57.110
Okay.

30:57.150 --> 30:58.947
It says The Beatles
are The Beatles

30:58.990 --> 31:01.982
because they played 10,000
hours in a German strip club.

31:02.020 --> 31:04.022
Bill Gates is
Bill Gates because

31:04.060 --> 31:07.325
he worked 10,000 hours in an
after-school computer lab.

31:07.360 --> 31:08.657
What do you want, Mr. Childs?

31:08.700 --> 31:11.419
To give you the chance
to work 10,000 hours

31:11.470 --> 31:13.028
prosecuting the worst
scum in Chicago.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.288
I know who you are, Cary.

31:16.340 --> 31:19.605
I know you're responsible for
some of our worst defeats.

31:19.640 --> 31:20.937
And I also know

31:20.980 --> 31:22.174
that you were
underappreciated

31:22.210 --> 31:23.677
and undervalued at
Lockhart/Gardner.

31:23.710 --> 31:26.042
I want you to join
us, I want you to...

31:26.080 --> 31:27.342
Yes.

31:28.650 --> 31:30.948
I'll need your help
with Alicia Florrick.

31:30.990 --> 31:33.185
She and her
husband".
Yes.

31:35.220 --> 31:36.585
Good.

31:36.620 --> 31:38.622
See you tomorrow.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.391
Thanks.

31:51.670 --> 31:54.173
Here we go. I think
I hold control, shift and D.

31:54.210 --> 31:56.178
(computer chimes)
No. F.

31:56.210 --> 31:58.542
No.
Actually, Ms. Tascioni,
I-I am a little busy.

31:59.750 --> 32:01.172
Yes, the problem is,

32:01.220 --> 32:03.211
I lack confidence
with computers.

32:03.250 --> 32:05.286
Can we... do this another time?

32:05.320 --> 32:07.982
Did you know Mrs. Kozko
has three children?

32:08.020 --> 32:10.056
Anthony, Lisa
and Arthur.

32:10.090 --> 32:11.159
I didn't.

32:11.190 --> 32:15.024
Anthony is the oldest,
Lisa's the middle child, and...

32:15.060 --> 32:16.322
(computer chimes)
Darn!

32:16.360 --> 32:18.225
Control, C?

32:18.270 --> 32:20.067
(computer chimes)
Arthur is the youngest?

32:20.100 --> 32:21.499
Yes. Arthur is the youngest.

32:21.540 --> 32:25.499
Well, Mr. and Mrs. Kozko
placed $45,000

32:25.540 --> 32:27.701
in all of their accounts
for college.

32:27.740 --> 32:28.707
(whispers):
Mr. Gold?

32:28.740 --> 32:30.276
Very nice gesture.
Okay.

32:30.310 --> 32:32.198
And this money was not
to be touched

32:32.250 --> 32:33.672
until they graduated
from high school.

32:33.710 --> 32:37.476
Well, Anthony already graduated
from college, so he spent his.

32:37.520 --> 32:40.683
And Lisa is in college now,

32:40.720 --> 32:42.688
so she's halfway
through her spending.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.483
And Arthur...

32:44.530 --> 32:47.249
Arthur didn't start spending
his college money

32:47.290 --> 32:48.723
until this year.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.728
Two weeks ago, to be specific.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.558
Okay.

32:53.600 --> 32:57.161
Well, the funny thing is,
Arthur isn't in college.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.566
In fact, Arthur

32:59.610 --> 33:02.408
was a stillborn birth in 1992.

33:04.450 --> 33:05.769
Now, that is funny.

33:05.810 --> 33:07.573
Yes.

33:07.610 --> 33:08.770
And that got me thinking--

33:08.820 --> 33:10.549
who is withdrawing
all this money

33:10.580 --> 33:11.547
from his bank account?

33:11.590 --> 33:12.682
And where is it withdrawn?

33:12.720 --> 33:14.688
Funny you should ask.

33:14.720 --> 33:16.415
STL Bank and Trust

33:16.460 --> 33:17.313
in Savannah.

33:17.360 --> 33:18.224
Georgia?

33:18.260 --> 33:19.682
No. Did you know

33:19.730 --> 33:21.698
there's another Savannah,
in the Cayman Islands?

33:21.730 --> 33:24.062
I did not know that.

33:24.100 --> 33:26.068
It's interesting, isn't it?

33:26.100 --> 33:28.568
So how are you ahead
of the police on this?

33:29.600 --> 33:31.602
They're not looking.

33:34.210 --> 33:36.303
You seem to be down
one partner today.

33:36.340 --> 33:38.046
And I'm wearing
a different tie.

33:38.080 --> 33:39.445
What's that matter?

33:39.480 --> 33:42.574
We want involuntary
manslaughter, ﬁve years.

33:42.620 --> 33:43.644
With for-day time off?

33:43.680 --> 33:46.183
That's three years
for a brutal sexual homicide.

33:46.220 --> 33:48.051
Second degree, 15
years, and we're putting

33:48.090 --> 33:49.614
a 24-hour clock on it.

33:49.660 --> 33:51.719
Offer expires tomorrow.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.728
We have proof
that Sweeney was stalked.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.399
Can we at least stipulate
the victim stalked him?

33:56.430 --> 33:58.318
Agreed, he was stalked. So?

33:58.370 --> 33:59.598
ALICIA:
There are

33:59.630 --> 34:01.598
stalker statutes on the books--

34:01.640 --> 34:03.460
statutes
that my husband instituted when

34:03.500 --> 34:05.263
he was in office.

34:06.310 --> 34:08.335
And your point, Mrs. Florrick?

34:08.380 --> 34:09.506
Talk to your boss.

34:09.540 --> 34:11.269
What sort of message
would he be sending

34:11.310 --> 34:13.471
to stalking victims
if Sweeney's prosecuted?

34:13.510 --> 34:15.569
Are you really trying
a blame-the-victim defense

34:15.620 --> 34:16.746
with Colin Sweeney?

34:16.780 --> 34:20.216
Offer him ten years, and we
don't have to go to trial.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.683
Then let me talk to my boss.

34:26.730 --> 34:29.119
(clears throat)

34:29.160 --> 34:31.128
Where is Diane?

34:31.170 --> 34:32.489
Chinese Wall.

34:32.530 --> 34:34.794
Criminal and acquisitions.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.193
The merger?

34:36.240 --> 34:38.299
Yes. It's my guess,

34:38.340 --> 34:41.138
it's probably more lucrative
if Sweeney's out of the picture.

34:41.180 --> 34:43.876
If Sweeney takes a plea,
he can be removed as CEO.

34:43.910 --> 34:46.299
Does Sweeney
know about this?

34:46.350 --> 34:48.614
He knows_ _ _
that we represent hIs crImInal

34:48.650 --> 34:50.709
and financial interests.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.112
Feighen Ladsloe.
The murderer?

34:57.160 --> 34:58.286
Mm-hmm. On death row.

34:58.330 --> 34:59.456
Sheila corresponded with him.

34:59.490 --> 35:00.684
Before Sweeney?

35:00.730 --> 35:03.494
You know, I thought I recognized
those entries in her diary.

35:03.530 --> 35:05.327
The ones Sweeney
said were fiction--

35:05.370 --> 35:06.792
they were from
Feighen's trial.

35:06.830 --> 35:07.728
The court reporter?

35:07.770 --> 35:09.897
Yeah. I'm checking
all of her trials now,

35:09.940 --> 35:12.500
see what other killers
she corresponded with.

35:12.540 --> 35:13.666
Where you going?

35:13.710 --> 35:14.529
To tell Julius.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.832
This could get them down
from ten years.

35:35.830 --> 35:37.252
Hey.

35:37.300 --> 35:40.292
Hey. How's that Chinese Wall?

35:42.370 --> 35:44.702
Mrs. Florrick,
as much I like

35:44.740 --> 35:46.560
keeping our working
relationship collegial,

35:46.610 --> 35:48.601
don't forget,
you're a junior associate,

35:48.640 --> 35:49.800
and I'm an equity partner.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.671
Watch your tone.

35:51.710 --> 35:53.803
Yes, sir. I will.

35:53.850 --> 35:56.842
I think we should
reconsider the plea bargain.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.711
Kalinda's found
new evndence.

35:58.750 --> 36:00.809
What evidence?
Sheila Warburg--

36:00.850 --> 36:01.919
she stalked other killers.

36:01.960 --> 36:04.554
So you think he's innocent?

36:04.590 --> 36:06.285
No.

36:06.330 --> 36:09.720
I think he's
innocent of this.

36:09.760 --> 36:13.196
SCHICKEL: I am ready
to_ hear Mrs. Kozko's _
testimony, Ms. Tascronl.

36:13.230 --> 36:15.892
Yes, just one last
objection, Your Honor.

36:15.940 --> 36:18.534
The Peterson Law--
as atrOCIous as It may be...

36:18.570 --> 36:19.798
Objection.

36:19.840 --> 36:22.274
Sustained.
It requrres
that Mr. Florrick

36:22.310 --> 36:24.346
not only profit
from a murder, but be

36:24.380 --> 36:25.904
the instrument
of that murder, correct?

36:25.950 --> 36:27.747
Are you asking me, Ms. Tascioni?

36:27.780 --> 36:30.943
Um, no, but you can answer
if you want to.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.811
And you can get to the point.

36:32.850 --> 36:34.613
Oh, okay. Well,

36:34.660 --> 36:37.709
for Mr. Kozko to be murdered,
one key thing is required

36:37.760 --> 36:38.988
that we overlooked.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.759
And what is that, Ms. Tascioni?

36:40.790 --> 36:42.257
That he be dead.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.291
(gallery murmuring)

36:50.600 --> 36:52.636
I did it.

36:52.670 --> 36:56.379
Um, this is an ATM photo
taken a week ago

36:56.410 --> 36:59.299
at BCP Bank and Trust
in Savannah, Cayman Islands.

36:59.350 --> 37:03.309
Your Honor, Mrs. Kozko's hearsay
testimony is inadmissible,

37:03.350 --> 37:06.649
and Mr. Kozko's video proffer
is likewise inadmissible

37:06.690 --> 37:10.683
for the very simple reason
that Mr. Kozko is still alive.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.688
(gallery murmuring)
(gavel raps)

37:12.730 --> 37:15.893
SCHICKEL:
Quiet. Quiet, please.

37:16.930 --> 37:18.795
It's done.

37:18.830 --> 37:20.525
You're free.

37:32.550 --> 37:34.541
(laughs)

37:36.950 --> 37:38.349
Kalinda.

37:38.390 --> 37:39.812
Hi.

37:39.850 --> 37:40.839
Hey.

37:40.890 --> 37:43.381
So, your boy is free.

37:43.420 --> 37:44.956
My boy?

37:44.990 --> 37:47.424
Florrick. He just won.

37:47.460 --> 37:48.950
Really?
Yeah.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.366
Wow.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.561
So I hear
there are some tapes.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.397
Oh, there are
always some tapes.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.795
And I hear that they
hurt Childs and Florrick,

37:57.840 --> 37:59.637
so neither wanted to use them.

37:59.670 --> 38:01.331
Mutually Assured
Destruction.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.007
Sounds like
a fairy tale.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.440
Funny how fairy tales
turn out to be true.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.641
Here's the thing, Kalinda.

38:07.680 --> 38:10.342
This isn't about Childs
or Florrick.

38:10.380 --> 38:12.883
This is about Childs
and Florrick.

38:12.920 --> 38:16.083
We're investigating
them both, and

38:16.120 --> 38:18.088
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

38:18.120 --> 38:21.954
Thank you for
your concern.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.956
Hey.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.991
I'm your friend here.

38:27.030 --> 38:29.032
It's good to know.

38:34.910 --> 38:37.731
So you would advise me
to take this?

38:37.780 --> 38:39.873
It's the best deal
we could have made.

38:39.910 --> 38:42.447
Eight years, and this
is after we started with

38:42.480 --> 38:45.085
what I would have said was a...
an adamant 45.

38:47.090 --> 38:48.853
SWEENEY:
Mrs. Florrick?

38:49.960 --> 38:51.655
It's true.

38:51.690 --> 38:53.578
They started
with 45 years.

38:53.630 --> 38:56.554
And why not court?

38:56.600 --> 38:58.898
JULIUS: Well, it's coming down
to perceptions, Mr. Sweeney.

38:58.930 --> 39:02.388
We would have filed for a
change of venue, but...

39:02.440 --> 39:04.135
I'm famous everywhere?

39:04.170 --> 39:06.104
Yes.

39:06.140 --> 39:07.630
(cell lock buzzes in distance)

39:07.670 --> 39:10.935
They like me here. In prison.

39:10.980 --> 39:12.641
I'm like the king of kings.

39:12.680 --> 39:15.114
It's not unlike getting

39:15.150 --> 39:17.846
the best table
at Schwa, actually.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.541
Same jockeying for position.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.751
We have until 6:00
to take the plea.

39:21.790 --> 39:24.088
Okay, thank you, Julius.

39:24.120 --> 39:26.953
I-I-I need to talk
to Mrs. Florrick

39:26.990 --> 39:28.992
for a second.

39:29.030 --> 39:30.918
We're, uh, working together.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.029
Yes, I understand.

39:32.070 --> 39:36.734
I just have a piece of gossip
I want to share, please.

39:45.510 --> 39:46.943
(lock buzzes)

39:50.620 --> 39:52.042
It's about the merger?

39:52.090 --> 39:53.580
Yes.

39:53.620 --> 39:57.784
The company means more
with me out of the picture?

39:57.820 --> 39:58.923
Yes.

39:58.960 --> 40:01.019
And...

40:01.060 --> 40:03.426
can I get better
than eight years?

40:03.460 --> 40:04.461
No.

40:04.500 --> 40:06.718
And if we go to trial?

40:08.230 --> 40:10.198
I don't know.

40:10.240 --> 40:13.732
Sheila Warburg has
stalked other killers,

40:13.770 --> 40:16.705
but I don't know if that's
enough to overcome your...

40:16.740 --> 40:19.140
your baggage.

40:20.980 --> 40:22.049
Yeah.

40:22.080 --> 40:25.117
Yeah, that's-that's
what I thought.

40:27.220 --> 40:29.415
Well...

40:32.130 --> 40:34.121
I did kill my wife.

40:34.160 --> 40:36.720
So I guess the universe

40:36.760 --> 40:39.763
is having its little joke
at my expense.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.563
You killed her?

40:45.070 --> 40:47.038
(laughs)

40:47.070 --> 40:48.571
(snorts)

40:48.610 --> 40:50.134
Your face.

40:57.150 --> 40:59.141
Thank you.

41:01.020 --> 41:04.524
Thank you for being honest.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.152
You're welcome.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.190
Well...

41:17.240 --> 41:19.231
(sighs)

41:20.140 --> 41:22.938
OﬁIgo

41:31.850 --> 41:34.045
(door slams)

41:34.090 --> 41:36.285
* You feelin' all right?

41:36.320 --> 41:38.652
(applause and cheering)

41:38.690 --> 41:41.796
* I'm not feelin'
too good, myself *

41:43.860 --> 41:46.567
* Well, you feelin' all right?

41:48.770 --> 41:52.228
* I'm not feelin'
too good, myself... *

41:56.110 --> 41:57.202
It's over, isn't it?

41:57.240 --> 41:59.174
Looks like it.

41:59.210 --> 42:01.576
(Peter laughing)

42:01.620 --> 42:03.110
Zach's drinking
champagne.

42:03.150 --> 42:05.289
Zach?
Itssoda.

42:06.690 --> 42:08.112
Do you know all these people?

42:08.150 --> 42:09.117
ALICIA:
Some.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.628
Mike, hey!

42:11.660 --> 42:13.821
So, what are
we gonna do?

42:13.860 --> 42:16.021
Well, clean up.

42:16.060 --> 42:17.152
No, after that.

42:17.200 --> 42:19.566
Oh. I don't know.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.124
What do you want to do?

42:21.170 --> 42:24.731
Buy a big house?

42:24.770 --> 42:27.762
Go to Europe?

42:29.880 --> 42:33.099
* I'm not feelin'
too good, myself... *

42:33.150 --> 42:35.141
He couldn't have
done it without you.

42:35.180 --> 42:37.341
Oh, that's not true.

42:37.380 --> 42:39.644
It is. We women

42:39.690 --> 42:42.750
stay in the shadows, we smile,
we comfort, we nurse,

42:42.790 --> 42:45.179
but we're always there.

42:47.760 --> 42:50.092
You are a good woman, Alicia.

42:52.230 --> 42:53.868
PETER:
Alicia?

42:56.700 --> 42:58.065
He needs you.

42:58.100 --> 42:59.306
Alicia?

43:10.420 --> 43:11.944
I'm not the lavwer.

43:11.990 --> 43:14.049
You need to speak
to my wife. Hon?

43:15.820 --> 43:19.256
