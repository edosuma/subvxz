WEBVTT

00:18.952 --> 00:20.788
[Harley] C'mon.
C'mon. C'mon.

00:20.855 --> 00:23.088
Oh, my God,
you piece of shit!

00:26.559 --> 00:28.189
Ugh, damn it!

00:28.189 --> 00:31.064
How is a girl suppose to
plan her takeover of Gotham

00:31.131 --> 00:33.265
[shouts] if she can't see
her kill board?

00:33.332 --> 00:36.235
It's only six people, Harls.
And two of them were dead
when you made this list.

00:36.235 --> 00:37.804
Well, I wanted to give
us a head start.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.707
Like when you put your own
money in the tip jar

00:39.773 --> 00:41.441
at the beginning of
your barista shift.

00:41.508 --> 00:44.545
Ah! Mazel! How'd ya
make all these candles?

00:44.610 --> 00:48.215
Definitely not with
the rendered fat of
dead zebras.

00:48.280 --> 00:51.384
Well, then I guess it
remains a mystery.

00:51.451 --> 00:53.353
Ugh. We need power!
We can't keep depending

00:53.420 --> 00:55.756
on runaway zoo animals
for Psycho to make
candles out of.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.457
I made hats, too.

00:57.457 --> 01:00.426
Gotham is a wasteland.
No one has reliable power.

01:00.493 --> 01:01.728
[Riddler] Riddle me this,

01:01.795 --> 01:03.597
what's the only
place in Gotham

01:03.664 --> 01:06.400
with a still-intact
power plant and
running water?

01:06.465 --> 01:09.102
Well, it's right here!
At Riddle U!

01:09.168 --> 01:12.305
Where the young and promising
can charge their cell phones

01:12.371 --> 01:15.108
and their brains.
Right, three girls?

01:16.343 --> 01:18.111
[together] Yes, Dean Riddler.

01:19.478 --> 01:22.114
Mmm. Now, that's clean water.

01:25.652 --> 01:28.188
That asshole's the
only one with power.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.123
We're gonna kill him next
and steal it for ourselves.

01:31.191 --> 01:33.359
Ive, hope you're
vaccinated for HPV

01:33.359 --> 01:35.128
'cause we're goin'
to college.

01:35.128 --> 01:36.530
[Poison Ivy] Harley,
you know we're too old

01:36.530 --> 01:38.766
to get the
HPV vaccine, right?

01:38.831 --> 01:41.134
[theme music playing]

01:42.835 --> 01:45.671
Okay, here's the plan.
We pretend to be coeds,

01:45.739 --> 01:47.965
sneak into Riddle U,
kill the Riddler,

01:47.965 --> 01:51.510
maybe go to a sick party,
and then we have all the power
and water to ourselves.

01:51.510 --> 01:53.280
Ooh! What are you
gonna charge first?

01:53.346 --> 01:54.781
I'm gonna blow dry my hair!

01:54.847 --> 01:56.849
-As an actor--
-Not an actor!

01:56.917 --> 01:59.385
I know a thing
or two about acting.

01:59.453 --> 02:02.623
To go undercover you must
become the cover.

02:02.688 --> 02:06.293
So much so that you can
no longer even remember
your true self.

02:06.358 --> 02:08.829
Like a young
Mr. Jonathan Depp in

02:08.895 --> 02:12.164
the television series
21 Jump Street,

02:12.164 --> 02:14.266
and a very old
Mr. Jonathan Depp

02:14.334 --> 02:17.437
in the feature film
21 Jump Street.

02:17.503 --> 02:19.171
Yeah, you're not coming with.

02:19.239 --> 02:21.608
I agree, Clayface shouldn't go

02:21.675 --> 02:25.746
but your boo...
Stephanie is mad-stoked

02:25.812 --> 02:27.747
to hook up with you
on the quad.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.215
-Oh, God...
-What up?

02:29.282 --> 02:30.783
It is I, Stephanie,

02:30.850 --> 02:34.587
a fun, yet bookish
transfer student
from Chico State.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.389
Yeah. Stephanie's
not going either.

02:36.455 --> 02:37.790
[chuckles] No, she's not.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.393
You, however, are going
to a padded room.

02:40.460 --> 02:43.229
You're way harsher
than the girls who drove
me out of Chico.

02:43.295 --> 02:47.835
I can't spill the deets
'cause of the impending
lawsuit, so...

02:47.901 --> 02:50.604
All right, Ive, are you
ready for all-night
study seshes,

02:50.670 --> 02:53.205
talkin' philosophy
and smokin' cloves,

02:53.272 --> 02:55.407
puttin' up any poster we
want in our dorm room! Ah!

02:55.474 --> 02:59.278
You know what, I do have
an Indigo Girls poster that
does need a wall.

02:59.346 --> 03:02.616
Oh, my God! All right,
while you two geriatric coeds

03:02.682 --> 03:04.062
are rediscovering yourselves,

03:04.062 --> 03:07.586
the rest of us are makin'
zebra candles and
chewin' on water!

03:07.653 --> 03:10.657
[gasps] So it was zebras...

03:10.723 --> 03:13.293
Oh! At least the mouse
is alive this time.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.895
-Oh.
-Oh, my God!

03:14.961 --> 03:16.697
I drank two quarts
of that shit.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.932
I fear we may not
survive until your return.

03:18.998 --> 03:21.634
Then you and Psycho find
a water filter. Great idea!

03:21.701 --> 03:25.538
Ive, hope you're vaccinated
for HPV 'cause we're goin'
to college!

03:25.605 --> 03:27.507
-Yeah. You said that already.
-I know,

03:27.507 --> 03:30.576
but when I said it
nobody knew the plan
so nobody laughed.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.001
[Poison Ivy] Sure.

03:38.284 --> 03:42.254
[crowd chanting] Let us in,
let us in, let us in!

03:43.423 --> 03:47.473
-[gunshot]
-[people scream]

03:50.063 --> 03:51.531
Put us down on that tower.

03:51.598 --> 03:52.900
Oh, if my girlfriend sees me

03:52.967 --> 03:55.435
hanging out with you
hot young coeds...

03:55.502 --> 03:58.437
-Ugh.
-...she's going to be
green with envy.

03:58.504 --> 04:00.439
Oh, my God, fuckin' gross.

04:00.507 --> 04:03.644
-I thought it was cute, babe.
-Nice.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.627
[Riddler] Morning, students.

04:05.627 --> 04:09.949
Riddle me this, what's
priceless but still
costs 60k a year?

04:10.016 --> 04:13.319
-Riddle U.
-It's better than Harvard.

04:13.319 --> 04:14.989
-[Riddler] Carry on.
-[microphone feedback]

04:14.989 --> 04:18.024
Pretty lazy riddle, but he
is right about Harvard sucking.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.560
...and that's was
Water Fountain 29
where you can get

04:20.627 --> 04:22.997
the best Riddler water
in all of new, New Gotham.

04:23.062 --> 04:24.932
Oh, my God,
it's so interesting.

04:24.999 --> 04:26.733
So, like, I have a question.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.449
Where is the
Riddler right now?

04:28.449 --> 04:30.403
I'm sorry. Were you two
on the tour when we started?

04:30.403 --> 04:31.637
I don't see your name tags.

04:31.637 --> 04:33.439
Oh, we told you at
the beginning of the tour

04:33.439 --> 04:35.009
that we were
definitely there for.

04:35.074 --> 04:36.677
I, of course, am
Heather Witherbee

04:36.677 --> 04:38.879
and this is my friend
Izziadora Staplebuntkin.

04:38.879 --> 04:42.449
Hmm. I feel like I would've
remembered such distinct names.

04:42.516 --> 04:45.019
Yes, yes. We do have
very distinct names, Heather.

04:45.084 --> 04:48.822
-It's chill, they're with me.
-Oh, thanks, Steph.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.557
Let's keep this train going.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.658
He actually showed up?
I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.

04:52.725 --> 04:56.029
I dunno, Harls, I mean, he/she
seems to be very popular.

04:56.096 --> 04:59.733
And you've got to admit,
like, Steph's really pulling
off her crop top.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.334
I mean, you never
really made it work.

05:01.401 --> 05:03.502
I know. I never know
what to pair it with.

05:06.773 --> 05:10.476
Well, that was a surprisingly
easy and delightful stroll

05:10.543 --> 05:12.512
across an apocalyptic
wasteland.

05:12.579 --> 05:13.579
Of course it was!

05:13.646 --> 05:14.982
Any idiot could've done it.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.716
I'm a brilliant telepath and

05:16.783 --> 05:18.350
my talents are being squandered

05:18.418 --> 05:19.952
on menial tasks like this.

05:20.019 --> 05:21.687
And you do stuff, too.

05:23.523 --> 05:24.858
Shit! There's still cops?

05:24.925 --> 05:26.660
-[cops] Stop right there!
-He did it!

05:26.726 --> 05:29.428
[gasps] Your treachery
knows no bounds!

05:29.495 --> 05:32.432
I'm not going to jail
for you or anybody!

05:32.499 --> 05:35.367
-Ah!
-[camel bellows]

05:35.435 --> 05:38.370
Dang. Back to the clink.

05:38.437 --> 05:40.639
This is Two-Face territory.

05:40.706 --> 05:42.675
Whaddaya say, boys!

05:42.742 --> 05:46.413
Howzabout we compose
'em a story on deez
Chicago typewriters?

05:46.478 --> 05:49.048
What the fuck is
dickhead Tracy talking about?

05:49.115 --> 05:51.451
Oh, it's one of them
old-timey phrases.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.954
-See, from a distance a
Tommy gun sounds like--
-[machine gun firing]

05:54.000 --> 05:55.100
-[screams]
-[camel bellows]

05:58.192 --> 05:59.927
Ah! Well, I'll be damned!

05:59.992 --> 06:02.129
It does sound like
a typewriter.

06:02.196 --> 06:05.665
And that is the last
of the 17 hedge mazes.

06:05.732 --> 06:09.435
Yeah, if we could just have
a follow-up question to
Heather's earlier question.

06:09.502 --> 06:11.670
Do you think you could
lead us to the Riddler

06:11.737 --> 06:14.406
so we can thank him
for letting us in
his university?

06:14.473 --> 06:16.944
[laughing] I mean...
It's not like we're
gonna kill him.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.446
[all laughing]

06:19.512 --> 06:21.648
He's a very busy man.
You never see him anywhere...

06:21.714 --> 06:25.017
and yet, he's everywhere.

06:25.084 --> 06:28.588
Uh, making sure that we
all have clean water and power.

06:28.654 --> 06:30.723
That concludes our tour.

06:30.790 --> 06:33.660
[girl over megaphone]
A bachelor's in
puzzles is not an education.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.762
Bring back a useful degree!

06:35.829 --> 06:40.466
One that guarantees gainful
employment like [grunt]
art history.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.069
What the hell was that?

06:42.136 --> 06:44.805
The Riddler's the only one
who asks questions around here!

06:44.872 --> 06:46.839
What? Everyone knows that.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.142
How long have you been here?
You know what? Never mind.

06:49.209 --> 06:52.045
-While you're here, will you--
-Join the theater department?

06:52.112 --> 06:54.548
-No.
-But if I already have?

06:54.613 --> 06:56.783
Just get intel on the
Riddler's whereabouts.

06:56.783 --> 06:58.918
Ivy and I are gonna do
some general snoopin' around.

06:58.918 --> 07:02.788
Fine. Can do.
Oh, Chad! Wait up!

07:04.925 --> 07:08.562
Wow, this place is huge.
Where do we even start
to look for Ridd--

07:08.562 --> 07:09.562
Oh, there he is.

07:12.031 --> 07:13.533
Riddle me this!

07:13.600 --> 07:14.935
-[grunts]
-[water splashing]

07:15.002 --> 07:16.870
You're about to die, bitch.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.771
[man crying out]

07:21.274 --> 07:25.112
[grunting]

07:25.178 --> 07:26.947
You're not Riddler.
Who the hell are you?

07:27.014 --> 07:30.884
I'm Jiminey Riddles...
The Riddle U mascot.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.019
Holy frick,
it's Harley Quinn?

07:35.055 --> 07:36.055
Shit!

07:41.161 --> 07:43.711
-Ha!
-[man gasps]

07:53.240 --> 07:55.975
Would you like to audition
for the a cappella club?

07:56.043 --> 07:58.879
Would you like to audition
for the cool a cappella club?

07:58.946 --> 08:00.579
You're not cooler
than us, Garrett!

08:00.646 --> 08:01.982
[screaming] Oh, shit!

08:02.048 --> 08:04.550
[both in sing-song] Shit!

08:07.053 --> 08:09.290
Argh!

08:09.355 --> 08:13.060
Yeah, I know. And I got made
by the surprisingly agile
tour guide.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.262
-So...
-Let's go kill a tour guide.

08:15.329 --> 08:16.629
Find the tour guide.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.665
Ugh. College Ivy is no fun!

08:22.701 --> 08:26.206
Hey, I just want to be clear.
I'm anti-forcefully entering

08:26.273 --> 08:29.576
the dorm room of a girl
who sure does not
want us in there.

08:29.642 --> 08:31.644
Under normal
circumstances, agree.

08:31.711 --> 08:36.711
But Ive, this is an
emergency procedure.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.019
[shrieks]

08:42.822 --> 08:44.825
-Ahh!
-Babs, don't shoot!

08:44.890 --> 08:46.994
Izziadora? You work
for Harley Quinn?

08:49.028 --> 08:50.596
Wait... Poison Ivy?

08:50.663 --> 08:52.698
You were gonna rat us
out to the Riddler!

08:52.765 --> 08:56.802
What? No! Heck. If anything,
I want someone to take
down the Riddler.

08:58.304 --> 09:01.674
Hey Waynebox.
Play "Party mix."
And turn it up.

09:01.740 --> 09:03.277
[upbeat music plays]

09:03.344 --> 09:06.245
Look, there's some
seriously terrible stuff

09:06.245 --> 09:08.782
that's been going on here
ever since Riddler took over.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.080
Like, what kinda stuff?

09:10.080 --> 09:12.652
Well, like, we used to have a
really good basketball team

09:12.652 --> 09:14.321
and all the best players
just disappeared.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.389
And let's just say, it wasn't
because they went pro.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.293
Okay? I mean, they were
good for Division II,
but you know--

09:19.360 --> 09:21.000
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying

09:21.000 --> 09:23.596
students are disappearing.
Riddler's behind it.

09:23.663 --> 09:26.232
And I wanna take him down...
If you don't kill me.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.869
Yeah, but how do we know
that the second we untie you,

09:28.869 --> 09:30.836
you're not gonna turn us
in to your dean?

09:30.903 --> 09:32.272
You'll just have to trust me.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.140
[Gordon] Fair warning,
I'm only wearing a towel.

09:34.140 --> 09:36.176
By the by, you're out
of lavender herbal essen--

09:36.243 --> 09:37.610
What the hell
is going on here?

09:37.677 --> 09:39.011
Waynebox! Turn down
"Party mix!"

09:39.078 --> 09:40.214
[music stops]

09:40.279 --> 09:41.847
-Hey, Dad...
-Who are these two

09:41.914 --> 09:43.682
and why is there a plant
wrapped around you?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.251
There's a lot
a suspicious things
going on here.

09:45.318 --> 09:48.955
-She's gonna turn us in!
-We're just... Vining, Dad.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.724
It's an Internet thing.
You wouldn't get it.

09:50.789 --> 09:52.859
[chuckles] Goddamn Internet.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.394
You ladies have fun.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.763
I just came out to get
another beer for the shower.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.030
[farts]

09:58.097 --> 10:00.033
Oopsie-daisy.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.769
So, Commissioner Gordon
is your dad

10:02.769 --> 10:05.306
and he lives with you
in this dorm room?

10:05.371 --> 10:07.908
[sighs] He snuck in before
the Riddler took over.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.676
-It's been a--
-[Gordon sobbing]

10:09.743 --> 10:13.013
...rough couple of months.
For both of us.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.014
I've been trying to track
the Riddler and he keeps

10:15.014 --> 10:16.649
coming back to this
one location

10:16.649 --> 10:18.985
There's something going on
in this fraternity house.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.600
I see people go in but
they never come out.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.256
Uh, how is that different
from a normal frat house?

10:23.256 --> 10:24.503
I don't know yet.

10:24.503 --> 10:26.759
But I have three wristbands
to a party there tonight.

10:26.826 --> 10:28.600
Hey, this is gonna
sound crazy,

10:28.600 --> 10:30.062
'cause you're supervillains
and all, but

10:30.062 --> 10:31.600
if you're past
the killing me thing,

10:31.600 --> 10:33.133
-maybe we can all go and--
-[Harley] Great. Thanks.

10:33.200 --> 10:37.004
Oh, come on! I had to chug
a beer to get those!

10:37.070 --> 10:38.404
I didn't like the
way it tasted!

10:38.471 --> 10:42.375
Or the way it made
me feel! Come back!

10:42.442 --> 10:44.410
So explain that "vining"
thing to me.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.279
Is it something you
and I could do?
Or would that be weird?

10:47.246 --> 10:49.283
That'd be weird.

10:49.350 --> 10:54.350
You got moxie but we got guns.
You're surrounded, see?

10:57.823 --> 11:00.027
How are we going
to get out of here?

11:01.361 --> 11:03.062
Ah, perfect!

11:03.129 --> 11:05.331
I can't reach the pedals
and you can't fit inside.

11:05.399 --> 11:08.902
[laughs] We're gonna make
a few modifications.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.303
[hammering and whooshing]

11:10.370 --> 11:15.370
Is it just me, or do yous
hear welding?

11:18.211 --> 11:22.149
[laughs] And you said
you didn't want the
long metal spike.

11:22.216 --> 11:24.451
Whoo-hoo! I can admit
when I'm wrong.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.952
Ha-ha! There's another one.
Get 'em!

11:27.019 --> 11:29.155
Do I like Chad? Yes.

11:29.222 --> 11:32.359
But I don't know if
I'm ready to be
"Chad's girlfriend."

11:32.426 --> 11:34.061
Why does he want
to rush to label it?

11:34.061 --> 11:35.495
How long did he give
you to decide?

11:35.562 --> 11:37.197
Just the weekend!
And I'm auditioning

11:37.197 --> 11:38.932
for Garrett's a cappella group.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.168
Ugh! That's still
the cool one, right?

11:41.235 --> 11:44.203
It's too much pressure!

11:44.270 --> 11:47.039
Hey Steph! Can we grab ya
for a second?

11:47.106 --> 11:48.841
We got some intel.

11:48.908 --> 11:51.945
So did I. Betsy Dunkhaven
has a crush on Ava Stein--

11:52.011 --> 11:54.081
absolutely hates
Hunter McMurray.

11:54.147 --> 11:57.750
Who could blame her?
Hunter's got areolas
the size of--

11:57.817 --> 11:58.851
...pancakes.

11:59.952 --> 12:01.754
They touch in the middle.

12:01.821 --> 12:04.024
We got some intel
about the Riddler.
He's inside.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.426
And we got wristbands.

12:05.491 --> 12:07.494
VIP, bitches.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.395
Holy shit!
How'd you get that?

12:09.395 --> 12:11.764
It pays to be chad's
"almost-girlfriend."

12:11.831 --> 12:13.734
[dance music playing]

12:17.571 --> 12:19.539
Ugh! Gross.

12:19.606 --> 12:24.110
Gross. And grosser.
Oh, Harley... [sighs]

12:24.110 --> 12:26.178
What? It's an ice luge.

12:26.178 --> 12:29.014
Ya know I can't resist
alcohol bein' poured
down an icy surface.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.384
No, I did not know that.

12:30.451 --> 12:32.385
Listen, Harls.
Game face, okay?

12:32.452 --> 12:34.421
We got to keep our
eyes out for the Riddler.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.991
I'm pretty sure that
was the Riddler.

12:38.991 --> 12:40.561
It might've just been
Jiminey Riddles.

12:40.561 --> 12:42.195
No no, that's Jiminey Riddles.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.230
The whole party is
a fundraiser to cover

12:44.298 --> 12:47.200
his medical bills for
the beating you gave him.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.568
I already donated.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.105
Oh, you're good, Steph.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.539
Sorry. VIP only.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.740
But we're with Steph.

12:54.740 --> 12:57.009
Do I look like I give
a shit? Gotta have
a VIP wristband.

12:57.076 --> 13:00.179
[sighs] All right, Stephanie.

13:00.246 --> 13:02.482
You go in, you look around,
you report back.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.100
Real simple peek n' speak.

13:04.100 --> 13:06.885
What if I run into Chad
and he asks me where we stand?

13:06.952 --> 13:09.255
I mean, sure,
he gave me the weekend,

13:09.322 --> 13:12.225
but it would be
awkward not to
talk about it.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.059
But if we did talk
about it...

13:14.126 --> 13:16.363
Oh, my God,
it'd be just as awkward!

13:16.429 --> 13:18.599
Ah! I'm being ripped apart!

13:18.666 --> 13:21.335
Ugh, I'm going to
text my counselor!

13:21.402 --> 13:23.571
Oh, my God! You're
a fucking clay monster.

13:23.636 --> 13:28.636
Forget about Chad for
five seconds and do
your goddamn job.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.253
The best thing about
chest hair, chip catcher.

13:39.253 --> 13:40.652
[crunches]

13:40.652 --> 13:43.222
That's not even from
the bag you're eat-- [sighs]

13:43.289 --> 13:44.500
Come on, Dad!

13:44.500 --> 13:46.364
We know the Riddler's
up to something in
that frat house!

13:46.364 --> 13:48.995
Now, put on your shirt and
let's go full swat on his ass.

13:49.062 --> 13:52.131
I don't do shirts anymore.
And I certainly don't swat.

13:52.131 --> 13:53.399
Now, if you'll excuse me.

13:53.399 --> 13:54.567
I have some
Kimmy Schmidt to binge.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.537
This school needs a champion!

13:56.604 --> 13:58.572
New, New Gotham needs a hero!

13:58.639 --> 14:01.073
No. This city needs
the Bat. I...

14:02.643 --> 14:04.592
need the Bat.

14:10.082 --> 14:11.552
[keys jingle]

14:12.918 --> 14:14.221
[door closes]

14:14.288 --> 14:15.623
[spitting]

14:16.523 --> 14:21.193
That's not a chip.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.995
Ugh. He's been in there
way too long.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.299
Let's just kill the bouncer.

14:24.299 --> 14:25.600
Yeah, but we don't want
to cause a scene.

14:27.301 --> 14:29.101
[people cheering]

14:29.168 --> 14:31.568
Watch this, Ive.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.484
[people screaming]

14:43.549 --> 14:44.600
[thuds]

14:54.094 --> 14:57.244
[electricity buzzing]

15:03.970 --> 15:06.440
Hey, girls.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.142
So, [panting]
I figured out how

15:09.208 --> 15:11.043
he's generating electricity.

15:11.110 --> 15:13.514
By inviting people
to fake frat parties,
kidnapping them,

15:13.580 --> 15:15.315
and forcing them to
run on hamster wheels,

15:15.381 --> 15:17.350
effectively turning them
into human batteries?

15:17.417 --> 15:20.620
Oh, wait. That makes
way more sense than
what I was thinking.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.989
-[electricity buzzing]
-[groans]

15:23.056 --> 15:26.426
Oh, my God, that hurt!
[panting]

15:26.493 --> 15:29.395
Well, what fortuitous timing.

15:29.462 --> 15:30.998
We just had two jobs open up.

15:35.034 --> 15:38.706
Congratulations, graduates.
Welcome to the workforce.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.374
Joke's on you, Riddler!

15:40.440 --> 15:42.743
-I don't do jokes... I do--
-Whatever.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.477
The point is you're in
for a surprise.

15:44.544 --> 15:47.080
'Cause we ain't beautiful,
young coeds.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.581
[grunting]

15:48.649 --> 15:51.618
We're beautiful,
regular-aged women.

15:51.684 --> 15:54.453
-That's right, Harley Quinn--
-Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.758
I Know! Gee, I wonder
what gave it away?

15:57.825 --> 15:59.592
The '90s miniskirts,
the pigtails,

15:59.659 --> 16:01.461
the overall shorts,
or the chunky flats?

16:01.528 --> 16:02.696
-Oh.
-Jesus.

16:02.763 --> 16:06.066
So you took down Penguin
and came for me.

16:06.131 --> 16:11.131
Well, I got something
Cobblepot doesn't,
a riddle stick!

16:11.238 --> 16:13.173
[both laugh]

16:14.274 --> 16:15.708
Why are you laughing?

16:15.775 --> 16:18.678
No. It's a super,
super cool name, very menacing.

16:18.745 --> 16:22.115
It's a cane. What are ya
gonna do, trip us?

16:22.182 --> 16:24.484
[crackles]

16:24.551 --> 16:26.253
See? It is cool.

16:29.690 --> 16:32.024
[bullets ricochet]

16:33.326 --> 16:35.261
[tires screeching]

16:35.327 --> 16:37.727
[sirens wailing]

16:43.636 --> 16:47.541
Oh! How convenient,
those fake police men
ran out of gas.

16:47.607 --> 16:51.043
Uh, pretty sure it
was my sick driving
that scared them off.

16:51.110 --> 16:54.246
You idiots! They stopped
following you

16:54.313 --> 16:56.649
because you left
Two-Face territory.

16:57.518 --> 17:00.253
You're in Bane town now.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.388
[tires screech]

17:01.455 --> 17:02.655
[grunts]

17:03.691 --> 17:06.159
It's actually Baneton.

17:06.226 --> 17:10.830
And if you lived here,
you'd be home by now.
Let's get em'.

17:10.897 --> 17:14.433
What? We just built
a mega death car.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.836
You think we're afraid
of a few Bane goons?

17:16.903 --> 17:19.453
[syringe empties]

17:25.612 --> 17:28.162
[chuckles softly]

17:32.586 --> 17:35.756
I think we underestimated
the Bane goons.

17:38.592 --> 17:40.326
[people panting]

17:40.394 --> 17:42.229
Running sucks!

17:42.295 --> 17:43.830
[electricity buzzes]

17:43.897 --> 17:46.834
Uh, faster! My battery's
only at 75%.

17:46.901 --> 17:49.702
[crying]

17:49.769 --> 17:52.405
I can't believe Chad
set me up.

17:52.471 --> 17:55.474
I broke my
purity ring for him.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.478
Clayface, pull it together.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.748
Turn into something
skinny and slip out
of your belt.

18:00.814 --> 18:04.284
Are you calling me fat?
[wailing]

18:06.252 --> 18:08.521
Honestly, this is some of
his best character work.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.391
Yeah. I'm not sure
how much longer I can do this
in clogs.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.359
What is Rodger and
Hammerstein's Oklahoma?

18:13.426 --> 18:15.695
-Ah. Yes.
-[Babs] Let them go, Riddler!

18:19.199 --> 18:20.733
How'd you get in here?

18:20.800 --> 18:24.738
See, Tanner? I said we
should have a retinal scanner

18:24.805 --> 18:29.209
but you were all like,
"No, wristbands are fine,
It'll be fun, like Coachella!"

18:29.276 --> 18:32.880
This is my last warning.
I'm warning you.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.882
[sighs] Tanner, go kill her.

18:34.949 --> 18:37.718
Oh, great. Now I gotta
watch Gordon's kid die.

18:37.785 --> 18:41.384
-[grunts]
-[can hissing]

18:43.856 --> 18:46.559
Oh, my God.
Did you kill Tanner?

18:46.626 --> 18:48.528
No! No?

18:48.595 --> 18:52.766
No. I said,
let them go, Riddler!

18:53.467 --> 18:54.517
[bangs]

19:02.675 --> 19:03.844
[gun clicks]

19:03.911 --> 19:06.313
Whatcha gonna do?
Shoot all of us?

19:06.378 --> 19:07.647
No! Just that switch!

19:09.214 --> 19:10.683
[bullets ricochet]

19:10.750 --> 19:12.586
Frick!

19:12.586 --> 19:14.922
When someone says,
"What are you gonna do,
shoot all of us?"

19:14.989 --> 19:19.989
You say "No! Just you!"
Not the switch!

19:22.295 --> 19:24.230
[electricity crackles]

19:25.365 --> 19:27.634
[machines power down]

19:29.336 --> 19:30.536
[grunts]

19:45.719 --> 19:48.755
You've just been
citizens arrested!

19:48.821 --> 19:50.624
Gosh, I'm good.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.224
Is this what it feels
like to be Batman?

19:52.291 --> 19:54.426
Because I feel like
a superhero right now!

19:54.493 --> 19:55.996
-[Babs screams]
-Wow, Babs,

19:56.063 --> 19:58.565
you really know how to
just kill the post-fight mood.

19:58.632 --> 20:00.834
Sorry. I'm gonna call my dad.

20:00.901 --> 20:02.936
He'll arrest Riddler
and take him to Arkham.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.538
Oh, my gosh!

20:04.605 --> 20:06.773
This is gonna be so great
for his self-esteem.

20:06.773 --> 20:09.977
I dunno. I mean,
he seemed pretty confident
earlier in that towel.

20:10.044 --> 20:11.711
We'll just drop Riddler
at Arkham.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.512
You sure? I mean,
I could come with.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.816
[gasps] Then maybe we
could get Fro-Yo?

20:15.816 --> 20:19.452
Or w-what do you usually
do after a high-octane battle
between good and evil?

20:19.519 --> 20:20.854
[grunts]

20:20.921 --> 20:22.855
Yeah, we're gonna do the
drive-thru at Arkham.

20:22.923 --> 20:25.325
It's on our way home.
Easy peasy. Byeee!

20:27.661 --> 20:30.596
[music playing]

20:30.663 --> 20:33.213
[water splashing]

20:37.403 --> 20:38.739
[panting]

20:38.806 --> 20:40.641
[Poison Ivy] Knees up, bitch.

20:40.707 --> 20:41.842
Cheese!

20:41.909 --> 20:43.309
[Riddler]
You're the bitch!

20:43.375 --> 20:44.979
And a liar.

20:45.045 --> 20:47.881
You told that nice girl that
you were taking me to Arkham!

20:47.948 --> 20:50.017
-[electricity buzzing]
-[cries out]

20:52.519 --> 20:53.787
Three down, three to go.

20:53.854 --> 20:56.957
Ah! We are gods!

20:57.023 --> 20:59.826
Or at least demigods.
Maybe Titans.

20:59.893 --> 21:05.700
One brand-new industrial
strength water purifier
as requested.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.000
Oh, that's what you guys
were doin'?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.734
Yeah, that's what
we were doin'!

21:08.801 --> 21:11.038
We went through hell
to get you this.

21:11.105 --> 21:13.707
We took out half
of Two-Face's army!

21:13.773 --> 21:18.478
And we had to get
stomped into the
Bane boys. Fucking Bane!

21:18.545 --> 21:20.847
We made a death car!

21:20.847 --> 21:22.849
Oh. Well, you know, once
we got the power runnin'

21:22.849 --> 21:25.417
the water started comin'
out clear, so...

21:26.086 --> 21:27.554
[shatters]

21:29.455 --> 21:32.159
Ugh! Well, I for one am glad

21:32.159 --> 21:34.361
we can once more be
free from

21:34.426 --> 21:36.496
the petty trappings
of campus life.

21:36.563 --> 21:37.596
[phone dings]

21:37.663 --> 21:41.868
Oh, Chad! [giggles]

21:41.934 --> 21:43.703
What do ya think'll
happen to Babs?

21:43.703 --> 21:46.105
Eh, you know, I mean,
once the adrenaline
wears off,

21:46.105 --> 21:47.641
she'll probably
go back to studying,

21:47.641 --> 21:48.708
she'll graduate...

21:48.708 --> 21:50.144
Hopefully she grows
out of her awkward

21:50.144 --> 21:51.678
Batman obsession phase.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.779
I mean, we all did.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.648
[both sigh]

21:55.715 --> 21:58.551
I don't know. I feel like we
awakened something in her.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.919
[whirring]

22:16.103 --> 22:17.103
Yeah.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.478
[theme music playing]
