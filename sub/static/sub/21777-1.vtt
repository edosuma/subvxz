00:57.307 --> 01:00.652
Now the story goes that
John Denver, he was

01:00.727 --> 01:04.230
playin' at this little ol' place called
the Cellar Door in Washington, D.C...

01:04.855 --> 01:07.735
...around
Christmas time in 1970.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.663
His opening act was
this husband and wife duo,

01:11.905 --> 01:14.408
named Bill Danoff
and Taffy Nivert

01:14.491 --> 01:16.914
and they called
themself Fat City.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.167
That's
kind of a funny name.

01:19.496 --> 01:23.251
Yeah, that is kind of a funny name.
Socket, uh, 5/8ths.

01:27.546 --> 01:30.390
Now, one night, they decide
to go on back to the house

01:30.465 --> 01:32.559
and have a little
jam session.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.062
On the way,
they got into an accident

01:36.138 --> 01:38.391
and John Denver,
he broke his thumb.

01:38.724 --> 01:40.943
And when they finally
got back to the house,

01:41.018 --> 01:42.520
and Bill and Taffy
played him,

01:42.728 --> 01:45.732
played John Denver this song
they'd been working on,

01:46.565 --> 01:48.238
he flipped for it, man.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.619
And they worked on
that thing till dawn.

01:50.694 --> 01:51.695
Screwdriver.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.031
Flat head or Phillips?
Flat.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.538
So that's why
you like the song.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.871
Well, I like the song
because of the song.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.376
I mean, I guess I also like it

02:02.497 --> 02:04.215
'cause it's got
a story behind it.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.298
You know,
Bill Danoff later said that

02:07.377 --> 02:09.220
he ain't never even
been to West Virginia.

02:09.545 --> 02:11.139
Well, I like
the song, too,

02:11.214 --> 02:14.514
but I don't really think
it'll work for the pageant.

02:14.718 --> 02:15.890
Pliers.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.391
Regular or needle-nose?

02:17.471 --> 02:18.563
Needle.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.562
So you comin'
to my rehearsal?

02:26.229 --> 02:28.732
Yeah. I'm gonna pick
you up right after work.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.534
Just so you know,
I asked Mommy

02:30.609 --> 02:33.032
if she and Moody would
pay for your cell phone.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.910
She said even if they did,
you wouldn't take it.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.241
Sadie bug, she's right.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.248
The only thing

02:41.244 --> 02:44.418
I need a cell phone for
is takin' pictures of you.

02:44.539 --> 02:45.756
Gun show!

02:52.255 --> 02:53.928
Hey, Daddy.
Nope.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.457
All right.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.320
What say, Cal?

03:56.611 --> 03:59.615
Hey, hey, Jimmy. Come on in.
Shut that door, would you?

04:03.660 --> 04:06.163
Yeah.
Have a seat.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.794
Jimmy, I'm just gonna say it.
I got to let you go.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.882
Cal, I... I didn’t
even do nothin', man.

04:16.964 --> 04:18.591
I know you didn't do nothin'.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.598
But last week, someone
in H.R. saw you leaving,

04:20.677 --> 04:24.307
walking out to your truck
and they saw you was limpin'.

04:26.641 --> 04:27.938
So?

04:28.018 --> 04:30.288
My leg ain't got nothin' to do
with drivin' that Case out there.

04:30.312 --> 04:31.312
I know that.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.954
I know, but the folks over in the
big office, they feel different.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.668
And they said you didn't
list it on your paperwork

04:35.692 --> 04:36.989
when you was first brought on.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.446
No.
They are callin' it

04:38.528 --> 04:40.280
a "pre-existing condition"

04:40.363 --> 04:42.206
and that it is
a liability issue.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.843
Okay, this big then.
What is that, two to three feet?

04:43.867 --> 04:48.043
This big and you let me drive my
truck around the track tonight.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.865
Look, it's a four-wheel drive.
It isn't gonna hurt you.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.420
Almost heaven

05:33.083 --> 05:35.085
West Virginia

05:36.086 --> 05:41.092
Blue Ridge Mountains
Shenandoah River

05:49.391 --> 05:51.271
Purple Lady,
you know my brother, Jimmy?

05:51.393 --> 05:54.317
Oh,
Jimmy Logan, that ball player

05:54.396 --> 05:56.319
that was gonna be a big deal?

05:56.439 --> 05:58.441
Hey, Purple Lady.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.912
My husband, the Major,
when he was still alive,

06:01.987 --> 06:04.206
he loved LSU football.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.955
Whenever they'd show the games
here local, we'd watch.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.745
Of course for me,
it was all about the uniforms.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.547
Their jerseys are the most
striking shade of purple.

06:12.622 --> 06:13.669
Purple.

06:13.748 --> 06:17.548
Yes. Purple and gold.
Royal colors.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.674
Yeah, I got off early,

06:18.753 --> 06:20.731
so I figured I'd take Sadie
on over to her dance thing,

06:20.755 --> 06:22.098
so you didn't
have to drive her.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.054
Well, that's
great and all,

06:24.134 --> 06:25.945
you wanting to see your
daughter dance and everything.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.642
But it was yesterday.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.306
Shit.

06:29.598 --> 06:30.770
Excuse you.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.476
I got her there fine,
by the way.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.394
See, most people think

06:34.477 --> 06:36.605
if you're gonna go to
Charleston, then, duh,

06:36.813 --> 06:38.736
you get on the 85 to Danville,

06:38.815 --> 06:41.819
then the I-19
to Charleston. 54 miles.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.699
But, bein' 4:00 p.m.,

06:43.778 --> 06:46.327
I knew not the best time
of day to be on the road.

06:46.615 --> 06:47.867
And they're still doing

06:47.949 --> 06:50.793
all that shoulder
work on the I-19.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.088
Plus, then you got
the sun right in your eyes

06:53.163 --> 06:55.962
For that whole
stretch outside of Julian.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.922
So, yeah,
I took the 85 to Danville,

06:59.002 --> 07:00.629
but then I hopped onto the 3,

07:00.712 --> 07:02.760
so instead of
goin' up and over,

07:02.839 --> 07:04.512
I'm goin' over and then up.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.194
And after that it was a straight
shot on the Daniel Boone Parkway

07:07.218 --> 07:08.561
all the way to Marmet.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.856
Well, sure sounds
like you love to drive.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.309
It was just a rehearsal,
not like the real pageant,

07:13.391 --> 07:15.485
but Bobbie Jo is not happy.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.028
Now, why didn't
you call me?

07:17.312 --> 07:19.815
I tried, but your cell phone
seems to have been turned off.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.321
You should pay your bills.
Everyone needs a cell phone.

07:22.525 --> 07:23.868
But I don't like 'em.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.154
You one of them
Unabomber types?

07:26.363 --> 07:29.537
Yeah. I am one of
them Unabomber types.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.552
See, I don't like people
tellin' me what to do,

07:31.576 --> 07:33.044
like, "Answer the phone."

07:44.547 --> 07:47.050
Hey.
Oh, this is gonna be good.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.686
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry, I thought...

07:50.553 --> 07:52.021
I knew it was 4:00,

07:52.097 --> 07:53.849
I just thought
it was 4:00 today.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.401
That's the first time
you've used that excuse!

07:56.685 --> 07:58.483
Look, I said I was sorry,
all right?

07:58.561 --> 08:00.521
Mellie said y'all figured it
out just fine anyway.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.858
She also tell you
that she got pulled over

08:02.941 --> 08:04.568
goin' 30 miles
over the speed limit

08:04.859 --> 08:06.532
with my daughter in the car?

08:06.736 --> 08:07.783
It's our daughter.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.536
Sadie said her Aunt Mellie
"worked her Mellie magic"

08:10.615 --> 08:12.538
and talked the cops
into not givin' her a ticket!

08:12.742 --> 08:15.165
So that's a real good
character-building experience

08:15.245 --> 08:16.417
for our daughter to witness.

08:16.705 --> 08:17.706
Yeah.
Don't laugh at me!

08:17.914 --> 08:21.544
Yeah, whatever, forget it.
What's up with the sale sign out there?

08:21.751 --> 08:23.688
You didn't tell me you and
Moody was buyin' a new house.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.055
Daddy!
Hey!

08:25.630 --> 08:27.348
Ah!

08:27.424 --> 08:29.176
What you doing?
Nothing.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.306
Ow! Ow. Man!

08:31.553 --> 08:33.405
Hey, me and, uh, your momma
were just talkin' about

08:33.429 --> 08:35.398
maybe me and you goin' to get
some ice cream.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.942
I'm not allowed
ice cream anymore.

08:38.434 --> 08:39.436
Says who?

08:39.727 --> 08:42.150
Mommy. She says it's
got too many calories

08:42.230 --> 08:44.232
and that nobody
loves a fat girl.

08:44.441 --> 08:48.287
You ain't... I... I think
that's a little bit harsh.

08:48.611 --> 08:49.880
This is some of that

08:49.904 --> 08:52.453
co-parenting stuff that you
and I need to talk about.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.284
That Doctor Phil stuff.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.709
Hey, Jimmy!

08:55.785 --> 08:56.911
Hey, Moody.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.835
Yeah, what's goin' on, sweetie?
Wow. Thank you.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.800
Hey, hey! Hey, you two don't settle
down, we ain't gonna get no mall.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.636
Daddy, will you come with?

09:05.295 --> 09:06.981
We're takin' Sadie
and the boys to see that...

09:07.005 --> 09:08.765
That new, uh, Furious
Fast movie at the mall.

09:08.798 --> 09:09.798
You want in?

09:09.841 --> 09:11.559
Uh...

09:11.634 --> 09:14.234
That's a little... That's a little
intense for the kids, ain't it?

09:14.262 --> 09:16.264
They love it.
Keeps 'em quiet.

09:16.347 --> 09:19.067
They sit there starin' at the screen
the whole time, scared shitless.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.144
- You want to come?
- Please?

09:21.227 --> 09:24.356
I got to get going
to work. You know?

09:24.814 --> 09:26.942
I ain't got time
for a whole movie.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.494
But you go and have fun.
Give me a hug.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.659
Not on my back.

09:31.821 --> 09:32.882
But we're gonna
get some ice cream.

09:32.906 --> 09:33.998
Promise?
Okay.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.952
But it's got to be yogurt,
'cause I got the pageant comin' up.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.472
Oh, I finally know what
song I'm gonna sing for talent.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.840
What song?
Umbrella by Rihanna.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.443
When Rihanna
sings Umbrella,

09:43.500 --> 09:45.798
she's not really
singing about a rain umbrella,

09:46.002 --> 09:49.176
she's really singing about
her vagina. It's code.

09:49.672 --> 09:50.764
Who told you that?

09:50.840 --> 09:51.841
Everybody.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.453
- Come on, let's go! Everyone in the Expedition.
- Whoo!

09:54.677 --> 09:56.145
Hey, kiss your
mother when you leave.

09:56.221 --> 09:57.768
Kiss.
Kiss. Aw. Thank you.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.190
See you, sweetie.
Bye.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.985
Hey.
Yep?

10:02.185 --> 10:04.529
- I wasn't done talkin' to you yet.
- Okay.

10:05.522 --> 10:06.682
What am I in trouble for now?

10:06.731 --> 10:08.654
We need to talk
about some legal stuff.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.485
Hey, uh, Jimmy, uh, your car.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.366
Moody,
can ya give us a minute?

10:12.445 --> 10:13.446
Okay.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.873
Legal stuff?

10:15.323 --> 10:17.667
- You was askin' about the "For Sale" sign?
- Yeah.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.961
Moody's expanding.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.664
His family's openin' up a new
dealership down in Lynchburg.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.588
That's across state line.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.169
Hell, no,
you can't just tell me that,

10:27.252 --> 10:28.687
like I ain't got no
say in the matter.

10:28.711 --> 10:32.090
You'll still get your days!
Just we'll be in Lynchburg.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.346
You can drive across the
state line to pick her up.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.098
I have full custody.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.030
It's not happenin'.
I'm getting a lawyer.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.727
With what money?

10:46.229 --> 10:48.903
What do you say there, Earl?
Hey, Jimmy.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.652
So...

10:54.404 --> 10:56.498
- I've been uncoverin' a lot.
- Oh, shit.

10:56.573 --> 10:59.622
Did you know
Aunt Maggie, in 1983,

10:59.701 --> 11:01.544
won the Lotto,
but washed the ticket...

11:01.744 --> 11:04.213
It's folk tales
and backwood gossip.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.225
Well, you got to
admit this kind of stuff

11:06.249 --> 11:07.546
don't happen to normal folk.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.672
Not tonight, Clyde.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.812
Well, there's a pattern.
Just...

11:09.836 --> 11:13.181
Pappaw's diamond, Uncle
Stickley's electrocution.

11:13.256 --> 11:16.180
Mommy gets sick
after Daddy's settlement.

11:16.259 --> 11:17.570
The roof collapse.
Come on, Clyde.

11:17.594 --> 11:18.971
You blow your knee out

11:19.053 --> 11:20.930
and a roadside
mine takes my arm

11:21.222 --> 11:24.442
As I was transpo-in' out.
I was almost at the airport.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.274
What about Mellie, then?

11:27.729 --> 11:29.731
Ain't nothin' bad
ever happened to Mellie.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.233
Hmm?

11:33.443 --> 11:34.615
What?

11:36.779 --> 11:38.952
You just gave it a mouth.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.751
You need to take it back.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.124
I don't even
know what I'm tak...

11:44.621 --> 11:46.715
I'm gonna go to
my satellite office

11:46.789 --> 11:48.632
and then we're
gonna talk about this.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.469
See,
the dirty big secret is

11:59.761 --> 12:01.809
that I am
the asset in this scenario,

12:01.888 --> 12:03.606
it's not Dayton White. Right?

12:03.806 --> 12:06.480
And the simple fact is I'd
be driving that car myself,

12:06.768 --> 12:09.772
if my clay job wasn't running
a billion dollar company.

12:09.979 --> 12:13.654
You know? And by the way, it was my
understanding that this is America, people.

12:13.942 --> 12:17.116
So them trying to muzzle the company
that I created, in America,

12:17.320 --> 12:18.993
is a violation
of my free speech.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.998
And plus, plus,
two of those kids

12:21.115 --> 12:22.833
only had one
kidney to begin with.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.759
So, why isn't
anybody writin' about that?

12:24.994 --> 12:26.496
Right. It's total B.S.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.498
What do you like?

12:28.873 --> 12:29.920
Aw.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.751
I just thought of
a great song title,

12:31.834 --> 12:34.383
The Kindness of
a One-Armed Bartender.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.385
Oi, go on!

12:37.507 --> 12:40.351
Uh... Now, you see,
I got two arms.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.559
See? I'm a trans-radial amputee,

12:43.638 --> 12:46.517
so it's my lower forearm
and hand that's missing.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.851
My mistake.
I'm very lucky.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.316
I guess I'll settle
for a Stoli, extra dry,

12:51.396 --> 12:53.148
two olives.
Can you handle that?

12:53.356 --> 12:55.734
Uh, yeah.
Up or on the rocks?

12:55.817 --> 12:56.818
Up.

13:38.901 --> 13:42.201
Well, it's pretty good.
Could be colder.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.913
Ice shortage around here,
'cause of the water contamination plant

13:46.200 --> 13:48.544
from the chemical leak upstream.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.044
Hey, do you mind doin'
that drink thing again?

13:56.127 --> 13:57.754
I want to shoot a post.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.717
I got 1.2 million followers.
This could make you famous.

14:02.425 --> 14:05.679
How about he bounce a damn
ball on his nose for you next,

14:05.762 --> 14:07.230
like a trained seal?

14:07.472 --> 14:10.225
Sorry.
You got a problem?

14:10.433 --> 14:11.901
Yeah, I got a problem.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.729
I take exception to people
messing with my brother.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.611
That's two tours
in Iraq right there.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.901
He stepped forward when
others were steppin' back.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.203
So you need to
show a little respect.

14:24.614 --> 14:27.959
Thank you for your service.
And cheers.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.294
So, brothers, eh?

14:34.123 --> 14:37.627
You know, it's funny. With your
bad leg and his missin' an arm,

14:37.710 --> 14:39.883
excuse me, hand...

14:39.962 --> 14:41.482
...it's like the two
of you almost add up

14:41.506 --> 14:44.305
to one normal person.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.723
Oh, man,
I know who you are.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.651
You're that... You're that guy
on the TV with the drink.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.154
I mean, you're famous!

14:56.437 --> 14:57.437
Right on both.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.279
I'm that guy on the TV with the
drink and, yes, I'm famous.

15:00.358 --> 15:01.405
Very, very famous.

15:01.484 --> 15:02.920
Hey,
can I get a photo with you?

15:02.944 --> 15:03.945
Sure.
Yeah?

15:04.028 --> 15:06.228
Sure. You know, the guys at
the garage won't believe me.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.995
Make it quick
Hold on. Come on.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.462
Oh, that's nice.
There we go. All right.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.174
Hey, what the...

15:24.006 --> 15:27.260
- Hi, Earl. You got a light?
- Well...

15:28.177 --> 15:30.179
Always. Here.

15:31.514 --> 15:32.857
Ah, thank you.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.320
Stay down! Stay down!

15:45.528 --> 15:47.872
- Leo! Leo!
- It's on fire.

15:55.204 --> 15:59.050
That is massively stupid!
That's an $85,000 vehicle!

15:59.375 --> 16:01.377
Well,
he was assaulted.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.713
He tried to assault me!

16:06.048 --> 16:08.471
Well, don't just stand there gawping.
Get your phones out!

16:08.551 --> 16:10.724
Right, Max, all right, the phone.
Film this! Document!

16:16.893 --> 16:18.065
Hey!
Aw.

16:18.561 --> 16:19.904
Christ!

16:25.568 --> 16:26.911
Cauliflower.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.035
Yeah, this is Max.
Get Mike on the phone.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.707
What did
he just say?

16:34.577 --> 16:36.545
You can't just walk away!
This is a crime scene!

16:36.746 --> 16:39.420
Did you just say
"cauliflower" to me?

17:20.915 --> 17:22.758
Unless I'm mistaken

17:24.126 --> 17:25.436
yesterday,
as you were leavin' the bar,

17:25.461 --> 17:28.089
you said
the word "cauliflower."

17:28.339 --> 17:30.967
That's right. I did.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.104
The last time you
said that word to me,

17:35.179 --> 17:37.773
I ended up gettin'
sent down for six months.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.479
It was juvie.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.651
I was 13.

17:40.935 --> 17:43.438
And you were supposed to be
the lookout, now, weren't you?

17:43.646 --> 17:45.114
Bein' that I was
your kid brother,

17:45.189 --> 17:46.987
I let you lead me
into trouble

17:47.233 --> 17:49.907
with all your crazy
"cauliflower" plans.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.284
My life of crime is over.

17:53.155 --> 17:56.409
But you did make
breakfast this morning.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.119
Even burned
the bacon like I like

17:58.327 --> 17:59.670
And you hate.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.503
I also saw you have some
sort of robbery "to do" list.

18:04.166 --> 18:08.512
Now, I know this attempt to be
organized is a big step for you.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.181
So go.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.188
Charlotte Motor Speedway.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.600
The Speedway?

18:26.355 --> 18:29.359
It's one of the busiest
sports venues in the country.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.694
Just last year,
they had over 300 events.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.706
It's the official home
of NASCAR, of course.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.828
That's all run on
that main track.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.371
But that place right there
ain't just about racing.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.545
This place is like a city.

18:40.828 --> 18:43.547
A few years ago, they built
condos for people who wanted

18:43.831 --> 18:47.005
to live above the track all year long.
They sold out in less than 24 hours.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.257
They even got their own
police force and jail

18:49.337 --> 18:51.556
for people carryin' on
and getting out of hand.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.152
Do you hear the words
comin' out your mouth?

18:55.176 --> 18:57.520
"They have their
own police force."

18:57.720 --> 19:00.724
I'm midway
through my presentation,

19:01.057 --> 19:05.062
so you can just not interrupt
me and let me get it out.

19:05.394 --> 19:09.069
How many times have I listened to that
Logan Family Curse thing of yours?

19:11.734 --> 19:13.077
Thank you.

19:13.903 --> 19:16.747
Now, as you very well know,

19:17.740 --> 19:20.584
the Speedway has got a big
problem on its hands right now.

19:20.910 --> 19:24.005
A 40-year-old pipe burst and since
the whole thing's built on landfill,

19:24.080 --> 19:25.798
it's turnin' to mush,
which causin'

19:25.873 --> 19:27.090
all these sinkholes.
Sinkholes.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.760
That's right.
The sinkholes in the infield.

19:30.086 --> 19:33.260
Now, they want to fix this thing
up right, so what did they do?

19:33.756 --> 19:35.233
What'd they do,
they called a bunch of us

19:35.257 --> 19:36.657
who used to work
down in them mines.

19:37.093 --> 19:38.891
'Cause we know the work.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.230
And you do good work.

19:45.434 --> 19:49.109
We do good work.
But you were just fired.

19:49.438 --> 19:53.284
I was let go for liability
reasons involvin' insurance.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.007
Can you just get to the part of
why you think you can do this?

19:59.115 --> 20:00.788
I know how they
move the money.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.807
Who's got the code?
They can't get in!

20:17.133 --> 20:19.727
It's Christmas, 1225.
That's the override.

20:19.802 --> 20:20.974
Hurry.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.398
I got movement!
I got leg! I got leg!

20:24.473 --> 20:25.565
Give him some air!

20:25.641 --> 20:26.841
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.610
All right. Come on.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.656
Hey, Bobo, what
the hell is all this stuff?

20:36.986 --> 20:39.489
Well, that's PTT.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.162
What them, they gas lines?

20:42.450 --> 20:43.793
Pneumatic Tube Transport.

20:44.493 --> 20:46.666
Each concession
has its own rig.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.547
When a register
starts to fill up,

20:48.622 --> 20:51.000
they can do a money
dump through the PTT.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.674
Easy to do, and it don't
interfere with the beer selling.

20:55.004 --> 20:58.850
Plus, heck of a lot more secure than
tryin' to pick up cash during a race.

20:59.133 --> 21:01.319
So all them pipes they, what,
they just run right into the...

21:01.343 --> 21:02.686
To the main vault.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.689
The whole thing is
like a cash highway.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.813
I even know
the when to do it.

21:08.017 --> 21:10.190
June 4th, the Grocery
Castle Auto Show.

21:10.478 --> 21:13.652
It's graduation weekend. It'll be
the smallest turnout of the summer.

21:13.856 --> 21:16.200
And gonna be bare
bones staff and security.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.698
A real bank vault?

21:19.195 --> 21:23.041
Yeah, it's a tough one, too.
I looked it up on the Google.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.965
The only guy
that knows anything

21:31.040 --> 21:33.168
about blowin' up
real bank vaults

21:33.375 --> 21:35.377
is Joe Bang.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.889
Joe Bang, that's a legend
right there. You know where he is.

21:39.006 --> 21:41.179
No, I know where he is.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.395
We can't do it without him.

21:50.893 --> 21:52.895
This is a surprise.

21:53.229 --> 21:54.822
What you say there,
Joe Bang?

21:54.897 --> 21:57.901
Ain't seen you in a while.
How goes it?

21:58.234 --> 22:02.410
Well, I'm sittin' on this side
of the table wearin' a onesie.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.581
How do you think it's goin'?

22:07.409 --> 22:09.082
Well, you look good.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.923
Real good. Fit.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.588
You two got any quarters?

22:23.592 --> 22:24.889
I got a quarter.

22:24.969 --> 22:27.313
- It gotta be... Does it have to be quarters?
- Yeah.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.603
- Come on, now.
- I found one.

22:29.932 --> 22:32.685
Yeah, why don't you go over
to the machine on the left,

22:32.768 --> 22:34.486
you punch J-7, bring it back.

22:34.562 --> 22:35.609
Go on, now.

22:49.451 --> 22:53.456
Doctors. They say
I have high blood pressure.

22:54.123 --> 22:57.627
So I get this low
sodium salt, special.

22:58.294 --> 22:59.637
Fake salt.

23:02.131 --> 23:03.804
Can you believe that?

23:04.466 --> 23:09.472
Someone thought to do that.
They make fake salt.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.978
So you wanna talk business?

23:16.270 --> 23:18.443
Well, we got a job for you.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.149
A vault.

23:22.151 --> 23:24.950
Look
around you, my friends.

23:25.487 --> 23:28.161
My bank-blowin' days are over.

23:29.158 --> 23:30.330
Besides...

23:30.659 --> 23:35.005
I got a little nest egg,
waitin' for me when I get out.

23:36.332 --> 23:39.006
You're stashing $97,000?

23:39.293 --> 23:43.014
Buried under the oak tree with the
red swing, out at your place.

23:46.175 --> 23:47.518
Maybe.

23:48.010 --> 23:52.686
Ah, it seems your brother Fish
told his wife about your stash.

23:55.809 --> 23:57.482
Fish told Misty?

23:57.686 --> 24:01.065
Yep. Next day,
Misty dug the whole thing up

24:01.190 --> 24:04.490
and ran off with some
truck driver from Florida.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.866
What part of Florida?

24:11.158 --> 24:12.375
Clearwater.

24:14.203 --> 24:16.171
It's a Carven Hill vault,

24:16.246 --> 24:18.544
just like the one you
blew up in Parkersburg.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.217
Steel-encased concrete?

24:20.501 --> 24:22.503
Yeah.
Wall is 20-inch thick.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.054
Alarms?

24:24.713 --> 24:28.889
You sneeze within 10 feet
of a Carven Hill vault,

24:29.218 --> 24:32.438
its seismic sensors will have you
wearing one of these onesies

24:32.513 --> 24:33.856
before you knew what happened.

24:35.015 --> 24:37.202
Well, there's construction goin'
on around there right now,

24:37.226 --> 24:40.025
so them seismic
sensors are turned off.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.901
So we just need
you to blow her open.

24:45.192 --> 24:48.537
Yeah, I got five
months to go in here.

24:49.738 --> 24:53.242
I should probably lay low
a bit before doin' a job.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.748
This has to
happen in five weeks.

24:58.872 --> 25:03.423
I am in-car-cer-ra-ted.

25:05.587 --> 25:08.431
Yeah, we got a plan
to get you out.

25:19.101 --> 25:21.945
As in, break me out?

25:22.938 --> 25:24.110
Yep.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.244
In
the middle of the night?

25:29.445 --> 25:32.619
No.
Afternoon. It's a day job.

25:36.452 --> 25:39.956
You're gonna get me
out of here in broad daylight,

25:40.247 --> 25:44.969
do the job, and then get me back
in here before anyone notices?

25:47.296 --> 25:48.422
Yep.

25:52.968 --> 25:57.815
You Logans must be as
simple-minded as people say.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.650
People say that?

26:02.811 --> 26:03.983
Who?

26:04.480 --> 26:05.481
So,

26:06.315 --> 26:07.988
what's the take?

26:08.317 --> 26:10.253
It's bigger than you
can bury under an oak tree.

26:10.277 --> 26:12.120
- The split?
- Even split.

26:12.321 --> 26:13.618
No. No way.

26:15.324 --> 26:16.997
Well, why not?

26:18.160 --> 26:20.788
- I got a brother.
- I got two.

26:20.871 --> 26:23.624
I'd need them involved
to protect my interest.

26:43.018 --> 26:46.522
Sadie, why don't you take these over
to your momma and I'll bring the rest.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.608
When are you gonna give
that piece of junk up, huh?

26:49.691 --> 26:51.586
Come on, I keep telling you to
come on down to the dealership

26:51.610 --> 26:54.739
and I'll hook you up.
You know we're family.

26:54.822 --> 26:56.495
We're not family.

26:56.698 --> 26:59.747
You mean I can't interest you
in the latest V-6 offering

26:59.827 --> 27:01.704
of the American classic Mustang?

27:02.037 --> 27:04.540
3.7 liters of pure power.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.212
Come on.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.019
You can't tell me
you wouldn't love

27:08.043 --> 27:09.545
to get behind
the wheel of this baby.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.801
Come on, jump on in.
Take it for a spin.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.882
I don't need
anything that fancy.

27:14.049 --> 27:17.849
Well, you know, this
Nova ended up costin' Chevy a ton

27:17.928 --> 27:20.306
'cause it totally
bit the dust in Mexico.

27:20.556 --> 27:23.901
You know, in Mexican,
"Nova" translates to “No Go",

27:24.184 --> 27:26.186
so they couldn't
get anyone to buy it.

27:26.395 --> 27:29.740
'Cause they all thought the
car would, you know, "No Go."

27:30.023 --> 27:31.696
You're an idiot.
No, it's true.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.243
Not true.

27:33.402 --> 27:34.574
Look it up.

27:36.071 --> 27:39.245
I am kind of surprised you
went for the V-6 automatic.

27:39.741 --> 27:43.086
The V-8's just so much faster and you
can really feel the road under you.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.372
'Course, I keep forgettin'
you can't drive stick.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.254
No, I know how to drive stick.

27:47.332 --> 27:48.333
I don't think you do.

27:48.417 --> 27:51.216
All the cars you always bringin'
home from the lot are auto.

27:51.378 --> 27:52.675
I love stick!

27:52.754 --> 27:54.722
I'm a big fan of stick!

28:28.290 --> 28:31.294
Sadie! Come on! Come on!
Yeah! Yeah! Go!

28:34.296 --> 28:36.298
Come on, come on, come on!

28:39.801 --> 28:40.973
Come on, girl, let's go!

28:41.261 --> 28:42.478
Go, Sadie!

28:44.973 --> 28:47.396
You got a ribbon, baby.
Come here. What's it say?

28:47.476 --> 28:50.650
It's not first place.
It only matters if you win.

28:50.979 --> 28:53.198
What?
That ain't true at all.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.321
That boy's damn
near 14-years-old.

28:55.651 --> 28:57.824
Come on. Give me a smile. Ah.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.160
Go show your momma.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.160
Way to go, baby doll.

29:04.493 --> 29:05.995
- Come to Momma.
- Thanks.

29:06.161 --> 29:07.834
- Aw... Mmm-hmm.
- Hey, you did good.

29:07.955 --> 29:08.749
Let me see. Ah...

29:08.750 --> 29:09.807
Let me see. Ah...

29:09.831 --> 29:11.504
Well, I found 'em.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.006
Where?

29:15.003 --> 29:16.346
You should see.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.359
They'll know what
we want them to know.

29:34.356 --> 29:37.360
Let's hear it for
the Bang brothers, folks!

29:42.072 --> 29:44.166
- Argh! Damn.
- You all got a sec?

29:44.366 --> 29:46.460
Whoa, whoa, I'm winnin'.

29:47.202 --> 29:51.548
Okay? Not stoppin'. Don't you
put the Logan hex on me.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.796
Yeah, we been out
to see your brother.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.173
He tell you we were lookin'
to talk to you all?

29:56.378 --> 29:59.552
Joe said you need for him
to blow open the vault.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.220
- Something like that.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:06.847 --> 30:08.690
Joe said you know computers.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.733
Yeah, I went to, uh,

30:11.059 --> 30:12.732
technical college.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.735
Well, this here's a little
more involved than that.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.611
We need like a computer whiz.

30:17.691 --> 30:19.534
Like one of
them Facebook boys.

30:19.735 --> 30:21.963
I know everything there is to
know about computers. Okay?

30:21.987 --> 30:22.988
Do you?

30:23.071 --> 30:24.618
All the Twitters,
I know 'em.

30:24.698 --> 30:27.201
But me and Sam just ain't
sure we can help y'all.

30:27.909 --> 30:29.582
You can't help us?
Yeah.

30:29.911 --> 30:32.414
We're living
with the Lord now.

30:33.081 --> 30:36.426
Which means on
the light side of the raw.

30:38.587 --> 30:41.932
If you two ain't into this, then why the
hell did Joe tell us to come out here then?

30:42.215 --> 30:46.846
Gotta have a good reason to break the law.
Do somethin' like robbin'.

30:46.928 --> 30:49.431
Mmm.
Yeah, we need a moral reason.

30:51.224 --> 30:53.522
We'd be robbin'
the Grocery Castle Auto.

30:53.602 --> 30:55.747
You can't tell me you ain't
shoplifted from the Grocery Castle.

30:55.771 --> 30:59.116
Oh, yeah. We used to shoplift
from them all the time,

30:59.232 --> 31:00.779
but that was before.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.954
Well, our sister Mellie,

31:04.613 --> 31:08.243
she used to work up at the
Grocery Castle outside Manila.

31:08.909 --> 31:11.913
And they promoted her
to checker after a month.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.964
Then, the assistant manager

31:15.457 --> 31:17.425
- started getting handsy.
- Handsy.

31:17.501 --> 31:18.878
Oh.
So you can imagine

31:18.960 --> 31:21.964
our family don't have no love
for the Grocery Castle.

31:22.255 --> 31:24.257
I can understand the feelings.

31:24.466 --> 31:27.970
Yeah, this being their big event
and all, there at the auto show,

31:28.095 --> 31:29.312
we don't feel
too bad about it.

31:29.596 --> 31:30.643
Nope.

31:31.306 --> 31:33.308
Come here.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.564
What you think?
Yeah.

31:35.644 --> 31:36.645
Okay.

31:39.648 --> 31:40.991
Sounds good enough for us.

31:41.274 --> 31:43.823
'Cause of
the whole morality thing.

32:00.836 --> 32:05.342
I need you two to go visit
the bear in the woods.

32:05.841 --> 32:08.720
Tell him you're
there to collect the bag

32:08.844 --> 32:10.846
he's been keeping for me.

32:35.370 --> 32:36.872
Cauliflower.

32:53.054 --> 32:54.727
Vehicular mischief.

32:55.015 --> 32:58.519
Reckless endangerment,
destruction of private property.

32:59.019 --> 33:00.487
I'd take your
license away, Clyde,

33:00.562 --> 33:03.031
but it was
suspended two years ago.

33:03.398 --> 33:06.169
And despite your claim that this was
an accident, that your foot slipped,

33:06.193 --> 33:08.366
these are serious charges.

33:11.031 --> 33:13.033
Your previous run-ins
with the law were back

33:13.116 --> 33:14.868
when you were
classified as a juvenile

33:15.076 --> 33:17.920
and, of course, in determining
your sentencing...

33:19.748 --> 33:21.500
I'm taking into
account your service

33:21.583 --> 33:24.427
and the great sacrifice
you've made for our country.

33:25.921 --> 33:28.265
I sentence you to 90 days.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.152
You sure these
measurements is right?

34:26.648 --> 34:31.495
Mellie gave 'em to me.
And Mellie knows her trucks.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.389
Sadie's to-do list.
Make sure you get it all done.

34:36.491 --> 34:37.538
All right.

34:37.951 --> 34:38.951
Come on.

34:38.994 --> 34:40.416
Hoo-ah!
Careful!

34:46.167 --> 34:47.840
- "Tanning salon"?
- Uh-huh.

34:48.253 --> 34:51.005
Yeah,
well, we'll see about that.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.966
Now, it has to be dependable.

34:53.049 --> 34:55.347
I can't have no
chance of it breaking down.

34:55.677 --> 34:58.430
You want a camper coverin' the
bed of the truck? Or just empty?

34:58.513 --> 34:59.574
Yeah, a cover's a good idea.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.600
'Cause them campers
can get kinda creepy.

35:01.683 --> 35:05.187
I think them cops more likely to give
them camper trucks a second look.

35:06.521 --> 35:08.165
All right, Sadie-bug,
get them goggles down.

35:08.189 --> 35:11.193
I don't want to get none of this in
your peepers. You sure about this?

35:11.526 --> 35:13.028
I'm ready.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.872
All right. Close your eyes.

35:26.708 --> 35:28.676
You littered all over my car,
with your shoes.

35:28.752 --> 35:30.299
Well, I'm sorry.

35:32.756 --> 35:34.554
Ah! Wait, get your hand off.
Ah.

35:37.886 --> 35:40.480
Hi. Hi! Aw...

35:40.555 --> 35:42.557
You excited?
Yes.

35:42.766 --> 35:44.564
Extensions!

35:44.851 --> 35:46.899
I got real long this time.
Yeah!

35:47.228 --> 35:49.230
I thought you were
goin' as Rihanna.

35:49.314 --> 35:51.032
Daddy,
it's not Halloween.

35:51.107 --> 35:52.734
I'm not goin' as Rihanna.

35:53.068 --> 35:55.571
I'm singing a song
of hers for my talent.

35:55.862 --> 35:59.708
I still got two other categories to
compete in, Denim Wear and Glitz.

35:59.908 --> 36:02.252
For Glitz,
I need this hair.

36:02.369 --> 36:03.712
All right.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.253
Mmm.

36:13.588 --> 36:15.090
That looks like it hurt.

36:15.215 --> 36:16.216
What?

36:18.093 --> 36:19.265
It did.

36:20.929 --> 36:22.931
It's healing up now
pretty good, though.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.939
Looks like you coulda used
a couple of stitches.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.565
Mmm-hmm.

36:28.603 --> 36:30.605
A little late for that, I guess.
Mmm.

36:32.565 --> 36:35.239
Well, when was the last time
you had a tetanus shot?

36:39.614 --> 36:40.957
Um... Never?

36:43.910 --> 36:45.583
That the wrong answer?

36:45.787 --> 36:49.462
There are no wrong answers when you're
talkin' to a healthcare professional.

36:49.958 --> 36:51.301
Would you like one?

36:51.418 --> 36:54.137
What is all this,
like a charity or something?

36:54.295 --> 36:55.922
Jimmy Logan,
you know as well as I do

36:56.005 --> 36:57.973
folks around here don't
like the word charity.

36:58.258 --> 37:00.636
We West Virginians
are a proud folk.

37:01.970 --> 37:04.974
We have
a couple of grants, but

37:05.306 --> 37:07.559
mostly get by on
private donations.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.315
People happy we do our work.

37:09.644 --> 37:12.067
Driving from town to town,
trying to help

37:12.147 --> 37:14.320
locals who can't
make it to the doctor.

37:15.358 --> 37:17.611
What happened
to three-two-one?

37:20.321 --> 37:22.995
So you know me?
We met before?

37:23.491 --> 37:26.836
I went to Valley View.
A couple years behind you.

37:27.620 --> 37:28.712
Hmm.

37:30.957 --> 37:32.254
Back then you were all

37:32.333 --> 37:36.008
Jimmy Logan, quarterback,
Homecoming King.

37:36.629 --> 37:39.428
Only had eyes for Bobbie
Jo Campbell, if I recall.

37:39.507 --> 37:41.009
Hold that there.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.354
I think
you'll like this one.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.519
There we go. I got that.

37:54.856 --> 37:56.483
So, Sylvia?

37:57.525 --> 37:59.698
Ain't no one ever
called you Sylvie?

38:00.862 --> 38:03.365
No one has ever
called me Sylvie.

38:05.366 --> 38:06.709
That's weird.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.336
My name?

38:10.371 --> 38:12.465
Well, you know, it's just...

38:12.540 --> 38:14.542
It's kind of like
an old lady name.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.503
To me.

38:18.880 --> 38:22.054
It just don't seem like it
should be on a person like you.

38:22.383 --> 38:24.602
That looks like you.
That's, you know...

38:24.677 --> 38:26.896
My grandmomma,
her name was Sylvia.

38:27.222 --> 38:32.228
So that's just what I think of
when I think of that name.

38:39.526 --> 38:41.654
Oh! I thought
you was getting coffee.

38:41.736 --> 38:43.784
Didn't know we was
seeing patients yet.

38:43.863 --> 38:46.286
Uh, I got a coffee
and a patient.

38:46.366 --> 38:47.868
But we better hit the road.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.750
Sounds like that alternator
needs a tetanus shot.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.051
Alternators cost money.

38:57.126 --> 38:58.753
Tetanus shots are free.

38:59.379 --> 39:02.223
There's a garage over off
Bluefield Canyon Road.

39:02.423 --> 39:06.098
Ask for Earl. Might not be free,
but he'll treat you fine.

39:06.427 --> 39:07.770
Thanks.
All right.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.896
Hey, hey, hey, hold on
a second. Hold on. Hold on.

39:16.729 --> 39:17.730
Did we kiss?

39:19.399 --> 39:21.159
I mean, in high school,
we kissed, didn't we?

39:22.944 --> 39:26.619
That has got to be the worst thing
anyone has ever said to me.

39:26.948 --> 39:29.952
Hold on, hold on, wait, wait!
I'm saying I remember is all!

39:33.121 --> 39:34.464
I do.

39:35.582 --> 39:36.629
I do remember.

39:41.796 --> 39:45.141
I see there's still
a lot of your rules up there.

39:47.468 --> 39:48.640
So?

39:49.637 --> 39:52.481
Just, have you
thought about

39:52.807 --> 39:56.152
"having a backup plan",

39:57.478 --> 40:00.573
or what we're gonna do the
first time "shit happens“?

40:00.648 --> 40:02.491
Let alone the second time.

40:06.154 --> 40:09.078
Why don't you just worry
about your cockroaches?

40:09.157 --> 40:10.830
And I'll worry
about the rules.

40:12.327 --> 40:13.670
Okay.

41:11.886 --> 41:13.729
Jimmy?
Hey, what you say, Cal?

41:14.013 --> 41:15.060
Hey, how you been?

41:15.348 --> 41:17.076
What's going on, man?
Oh, you know, staying busy.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.819
Oh, good, good, good. Hey, did you
find work? Yeah, a few things.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.580
Oh, great. These parts
or back in Boone County?

41:21.604 --> 41:23.151
No, back home.
Oh, good. Good, good.

41:23.231 --> 41:24.733
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.710
You know, I felt bad and all
about having to let you go.

41:26.734 --> 41:28.170
Oh, come on, man.
Don't even worry about it.

41:28.194 --> 41:29.672
- I know it was them, not you.
- Well...

41:29.696 --> 41:30.756
Even if things
had been different,

41:30.780 --> 41:33.704
I probably woulda had to let you go
anyways, since we're wrapping it up.

41:36.077 --> 41:38.626
What? You're all wrapping up
the site? You all done?

41:38.705 --> 41:40.048
Yeah, just about. Yeah.

41:40.123 --> 41:42.592
Managed to be
ahead of schedule for once.

41:43.418 --> 41:44.419
Oh.

41:44.919 --> 41:46.421
You patched up
all them sinkholes?

41:46.713 --> 41:49.273
Yeah, almost, yeah. We're gonna
pull the gear first of the month.

41:49.757 --> 41:51.759
You know that thing
we been talkin' about?

41:52.260 --> 41:53.762
We got to move it up a week.

41:54.053 --> 41:55.054
What happened?

41:55.263 --> 41:57.106
Opportunity is
gonna be closing up.

41:57.390 --> 42:00.564
So everything stays the same, we just
gotta move everything up by one week.

42:04.564 --> 42:06.612
Wait, one week earlier?
But that's...

42:06.899 --> 42:07.900
I know.

42:08.943 --> 42:11.287
I guess
this is "shit happens."

42:11.612 --> 42:12.784
Yep.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.119
So should we cancel?

42:14.782 --> 42:16.125
No difference.

42:16.409 --> 42:21.085
The Coca-Cola 600 is the biggest race
of the year. That's a big difference.

42:21.289 --> 42:23.462
That don't
change the job at all.

42:26.919 --> 42:28.796
So should I call The Baker?

42:30.465 --> 42:31.933
Call The Baker.

42:38.806 --> 42:40.308
This is Gleema.

42:44.645 --> 42:45.897
Gleema Purdue?

42:45.980 --> 42:47.072
Yes.

42:47.148 --> 42:48.650
Need you to sign
right here, please.

42:53.196 --> 42:54.243
Right there, please.

42:59.786 --> 43:01.003
Who's it from?

43:01.162 --> 43:05.167
No idea, ma'am. No card, no name on
the paperwork. We just deliver 'em.

43:05.458 --> 43:08.837
He just said, "I guess someone
thinks it's your birthday."

43:09.879 --> 43:12.132
I mean, I have no idea.

43:12.215 --> 43:14.217
I've never seen
a more beautiful cake.

43:14.509 --> 43:16.807
Well, maybe somebody's
got a crush.

43:16.886 --> 43:18.138
Oh, well...

43:18.221 --> 43:20.519
I have no idea
who it could be.

43:20.890 --> 43:23.439
After that last experience
on Plenty O Fish,

43:23.518 --> 43:25.896
I have stayed away
from the online dating.

43:26.395 --> 43:29.740
Gleema. You better
come out front again.

43:30.233 --> 43:31.906
What? More for me?

43:32.193 --> 43:33.194
Not exactly.

43:33.569 --> 43:35.321
Someone hit and
ran you, ma'am.

43:35.404 --> 43:37.202
We'll check the cameras.

43:37.907 --> 43:40.581
In the meantime, we're going to
need to fill out some paperwork.

43:40.701 --> 43:41.918
Oh!

43:43.079 --> 43:44.752
My car.

43:45.706 --> 43:46.878
Oh.

43:47.583 --> 43:48.709
Tsk.

43:51.546 --> 43:53.548
Oh, man!

44:00.930 --> 44:02.307
Ma'am,
I'm sorry about your car,

44:02.390 --> 44:04.270
but I really need you
to start filling this out.

44:09.939 --> 44:10.940
Is it 5:30?

44:11.232 --> 44:14.031
Ain't no arguin' with that
automatic door. Are you okay?

44:14.110 --> 44:16.784
I didn't
get to finish my cake.

44:34.589 --> 44:35.636
Howdy doody.

45:28.851 --> 45:30.023
Hey, y'all.

45:30.519 --> 45:33.864
I'm just gonna
squeeze myself in there.

45:35.691 --> 45:37.364
So, Naaman,

45:39.528 --> 45:42.532
I got a little
proposition for you.

46:18.025 --> 46:19.572
...one... One...
One... One.

46:19.902 --> 46:21.495
Three...
Three.

46:21.570 --> 46:22.742
Eight.
Eight.

46:28.369 --> 46:30.497
Shit, man,
what's up?

46:35.084 --> 46:36.427
Hey, Jimmy.

46:36.711 --> 46:39.760
No names. You calling
from a secure location?

46:40.047 --> 46:41.094
A what?

46:41.382 --> 46:43.601
A secure location.

46:44.093 --> 46:45.436
I'm... I'm at the Lowe's.

46:45.761 --> 46:47.761
You calling from
a landline or a cell phone?

46:47.930 --> 46:52.106
I'm calling on a phone.
Like a real phone.

46:52.601 --> 46:53.602
Go ahead.

46:53.894 --> 46:55.896
We have a code pink.
I repeat,

46:56.105 --> 46:57.948
we have a code pink.

47:02.737 --> 47:04.785
Mel, we got a code pink.

49:04.191 --> 49:05.818
The shock-and-awe campaign

49:05.901 --> 49:08.871
of bacon and
sardines has worked.

49:13.409 --> 49:15.582
Fish! Sam!

49:17.371 --> 49:18.372
Hold on!

49:18.581 --> 49:20.424
Get up, goddamn it!
Hold on!

49:20.749 --> 49:22.092
Goddamn it.

49:22.251 --> 49:24.131
Hey, hey. You didn't
have to scare us like that.

49:24.211 --> 49:25.291
We thought you was the law.

49:25.421 --> 49:27.423
Oh, when did you have
a chance to think that?

49:27.715 --> 49:29.317
Seeing as you were
dead asleep a second ago!

49:29.341 --> 49:30.861
You were supposed to meet me
down at the corner!

49:30.885 --> 49:31.945
Now we're running way behind!

49:31.969 --> 49:33.312
We got it.

49:33.554 --> 49:35.227
You got it?
You still seem half-asleep.

49:35.431 --> 49:36.774
We're on it, okay?

49:36.849 --> 49:39.443
We know where to be and when.
"Watch the race."

49:39.727 --> 49:42.230
That's right! The clock
on the race. Remember!

49:42.438 --> 49:43.781
Yeah, we know.

49:50.196 --> 49:51.590
- Ah! Don't be late.
- Yes, sweetie.

49:51.614 --> 49:53.412
Hey, I'd like to
point out that today

49:53.491 --> 49:55.619
I am driving the V-8 stick.

49:55.951 --> 49:57.168
It's a nice car.

49:57.244 --> 50:00.123
Hopefully you'll have beginner's
luck getting it into first.

50:00.414 --> 50:01.666
Even in first gear,

50:01.749 --> 50:04.093
this thing will blow away
that "No Go" of yours.

50:04.293 --> 50:06.295
Not with
you behind the wheel.

50:06.420 --> 50:07.421
Oh, ha-ha!

50:19.600 --> 50:21.147
How you been, Jesco?

50:21.435 --> 50:23.108
Ah, hanging in there.

50:23.312 --> 50:25.314
Yeah, hang in there, then.

50:25.814 --> 50:28.442
He still writing to Correctional
Affairs about the food?

50:28.651 --> 50:30.824
No, sir, we took care of that.

50:31.153 --> 50:33.497
Good. 'Cause we
don't have a food problem

50:33.614 --> 50:35.332
here at Monroe, do we?

50:35.449 --> 50:37.049
You okay, Joe Bang?

50:37.284 --> 50:41.005
You're choking.
Someone know the Heindrick?

50:41.288 --> 50:43.632
Sounds like a wet cough,
like phlegm.

50:43.832 --> 50:45.505
I don't feel too good.

50:47.503 --> 50:50.347
Hey! Shit! Get this damn
convict away from me!

50:50.464 --> 50:52.512
Let's go. Come on.
Get him to the infirmary!

50:53.842 --> 50:57.016
Aw, Christ!
Guard, get some towels.

51:02.309 --> 51:05.313
Where are you going?
I thought you'd be with me the whole time.

51:05.646 --> 51:08.320
I just need to go to the salon
and tend to a few clients.

51:08.524 --> 51:12.529
I'll be back just in time to comb
you out and spray you extra good.

51:12.820 --> 51:14.663
Promise?
I promise.

51:17.825 --> 51:20.999
This will help rehydrate
you, ease the nausea.

51:21.203 --> 51:23.547
A lot of you guys
coming in here like that.

51:23.789 --> 51:25.336
It's that
business with the water.

51:25.416 --> 51:27.714
Say you can't drink it but
it's okay to shower in it.

51:28.043 --> 51:30.011
I don't know
about all that. Hmm.

51:30.170 --> 51:32.548
More barf than we saw
after that one Thanksgiving

51:32.673 --> 51:34.175
when everything had gone bad.

51:34.383 --> 51:36.886
It'll put a girl
off of turkey forever.

52:14.423 --> 52:15.595
Nurse?

52:16.425 --> 52:17.768
Miss? Miss?

52:18.385 --> 52:19.728
Miss? Um...

52:19.803 --> 52:20.804
Yeah?

52:20.888 --> 52:23.437
All these fluids?

52:23.724 --> 52:28.446
I'm sorry, nurse, but is it
possible for me to use the commode?

52:28.729 --> 52:30.857
Mmm, I think it's
best if you stay put.

52:30.939 --> 52:32.584
Don't want you getting
light-headed and all.

52:32.608 --> 52:36.454
Oh, please, ma'am,
don't make me use that thing.

52:36.779 --> 52:39.874
A second ago I was a miss,
and now I'm a ma'am. Hmm.

52:39.948 --> 52:43.623
Please? Miss Nurse?
I'll walk slow.

52:43.952 --> 52:46.705
Nurse? I can take him.

52:46.789 --> 52:48.962
I'm finished mopping
the floors in here.

52:50.626 --> 52:52.799
Okay. But take it slow.

52:52.878 --> 52:55.097
He falls and hits his head,
that's on you.

52:55.297 --> 52:56.640
Yes, ma'am.

52:59.968 --> 53:02.642
Yeah, I'm gonna
need a hand in here.

54:59.880 --> 55:00.881
What the fuck?

55:01.048 --> 55:03.767
What, you never wondered
what it's like to feel white?

55:19.441 --> 55:21.284
Move aside! Out of my way!

55:26.448 --> 55:30.294
This is Warden Burns.
I am declaring a code red.

55:31.453 --> 55:33.126
This is not a test.

55:33.914 --> 55:34.961
All guards

55:35.249 --> 55:38.970
and staff are to go into an
immediate code fourteen lockdown.

55:39.253 --> 55:41.426
I repeat, this is not a drill.

55:45.926 --> 55:47.428
What are you doing?

55:47.803 --> 55:48.975
Calling it in.

55:49.263 --> 55:51.106
This could turn
into a riot.

55:52.140 --> 55:53.483
Put that down.

55:54.476 --> 55:55.819
Hang it up.

55:57.437 --> 55:59.110
We don't have riots at Monroe.

56:03.318 --> 56:06.618
- "Pour one into two."
- Okay.

56:06.989 --> 56:09.617
"Pour two into three."
Yep.

56:10.993 --> 56:12.995
"Pour three into four."

56:13.996 --> 56:14.997
Okay.

56:17.499 --> 56:18.842
"And run."

56:19.501 --> 56:20.673
What?

56:21.461 --> 56:22.678
Run!

56:34.182 --> 56:35.525
What the hell?

56:35.851 --> 56:37.194
Are you down, too?
Yeah.

56:37.477 --> 56:39.104
They're all down.
Here on the mezzanine,

56:39.187 --> 56:40.860
we got no
plastic working at all.

57:29.071 --> 57:30.914
Mellie, what did you do?

57:31.323 --> 57:33.542
Well, hello.

57:34.409 --> 57:36.582
I guess someone grew up.

57:37.746 --> 57:39.919
What's your name again,
little Logan?

57:40.248 --> 57:41.420
Mellie.
Mellie!

57:42.250 --> 57:43.923
Mellie, Mellie, Mellie.

57:45.420 --> 57:48.094
That rhymes with "smelly."

57:48.423 --> 57:49.766
Nice.

57:50.092 --> 57:51.093
Shut up.

57:51.385 --> 57:53.112
There's clothes
for you both in the bag

57:53.136 --> 57:55.889
and, Clyde, I put something
special in there for you.

57:57.432 --> 57:58.775
Thanks, Mel.

58:00.435 --> 58:02.278
You're going pretty fast.

58:02.604 --> 58:04.582
Well, we got a lot
of road to cover so, yeah,

58:04.606 --> 58:05.949
there will be speeding.

58:06.274 --> 58:08.823
Gunning for 100
in a neon blue car

58:08.902 --> 58:11.121
that probably ain't
even on the market yet.

58:11.405 --> 58:15.410
Don't you think you're asking
for to be pulled over?

58:15.617 --> 58:17.290
Sunday on a holiday weekend.

58:17.411 --> 58:19.004
Police department
hit by budget cuts.

58:19.079 --> 58:22.424
There's only one musker patrolling the
whole highway for the next 40 miles.

58:22.958 --> 58:24.631
But that's
still one musker.

58:24.918 --> 58:26.465
It's been handled.

58:26.795 --> 58:27.967
Mellie,

58:28.463 --> 58:33.469
I'm about to get naked
back here. So no peeking.

58:36.138 --> 58:38.140
I said no peeking!

58:38.807 --> 58:40.980
Would you give
me my arm, please?

58:42.644 --> 58:44.146
Is it this one?

58:45.981 --> 58:49.155
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, I'm 100% sure

58:49.484 --> 58:54.331
I saw what I saw. It's a
purple '77 Eldorado. Yes, sir.

58:57.659 --> 58:59.661
License and registration, ma'am.

58:59.953 --> 59:01.751
Excuse me,
but I'm on my way to church.

59:01.830 --> 59:03.252
I don't have time for this.

59:03.331 --> 59:04.531
Step out of
the vehicle, ma'am.

59:04.583 --> 59:05.823
I am not going
to ask you again.

59:06.001 --> 59:08.470
This is ridiculous!
What did I do?

59:08.670 --> 59:09.967
I need you
to comply, ma'am.

59:10.088 --> 59:11.688
I need your license,
your registration...

59:12.007 --> 59:13.008
You seen that?

59:13.300 --> 59:14.973
Seen what?
I need you to focus here.

59:15.093 --> 59:16.310
This woman
needs containing.

59:17.137 --> 59:19.497
It's a beautiful day
for racing in the Queen City.

59:20.265 --> 59:22.688
Welcome to the
Coca-Cola 600.

59:22.976 --> 59:25.070
This is NASCAR's
greatest distance

59:25.145 --> 59:27.489
and stock car
racing's longest night.

59:27.814 --> 59:31.034
It'll take 400 laps
to complete 600 miles.

59:31.276 --> 59:32.336
And Mike, you know,

59:32.360 --> 59:33.963
one of the stories
we're all gonna be watching is

59:33.987 --> 59:36.748
this guy Dayton White, as he returns
to racing after a two-year break.

59:36.782 --> 59:39.831
And Jeff, you certainly know what it's
like to get back behind the wheel

59:40.035 --> 59:41.127
after some time off.

59:41.203 --> 59:43.046
Can we really expect
this guy to run up front?

59:43.330 --> 59:44.923
Well, that truly is
the question, D.W.

59:44.998 --> 59:46.841
And, yeah,
it is extremely tough.

59:47.042 --> 59:49.841
So much has changed since the
last time he was in the car.

59:49.961 --> 59:50.962
The cars have changed.

59:51.046 --> 59:53.174
The setups have changed,
the competition's changed.

59:53.381 --> 59:54.984
And you know,
you just can't underestimate

59:55.008 --> 59:56.931
the mental focus
and endurance needed

59:57.010 --> 59:59.513
to get back behind the wheel
after this long of a break.

59:59.846 --> 01:00:02.144
Well, focus,
endurance and discipline

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:04.852
could well describe
Dayton's off-track routine.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.482
We caught up with
him as he prepared

01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:09.531
for this highly
anticipated return to racing.

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:13.531
There's a team of
people looking after my car.

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:16.363
Making sure everything
is operating at full capacity.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.704
So it makes sense that I do
that for my physical self.

01:00:19.908 --> 01:00:22.878
Because I'm not just a driver,
I'm an athlete.

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:27.834
Once I began sourcing
really clean software,

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:32.046
I noticed a total difference
in my clarity and performance.

01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:34.430
Software's what
I call my food.

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:36.808
Because,
when you think about it,

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:39.762
your body is your
operating system.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:43.061
So when your OS may
feel like it's working fine,

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.019
a problem with software can make
your computer not perform properly.

01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:48.354
Even crash.

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:51.781
So eating only clean software,
making sure my OS

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:55.615
is working at an optimum level
and all this will help me win.

01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:07.630
Speed up the drops.
We'll figure the numbers out later.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.774
No energy drink on the market
comes in a magnum, right?

01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:32.940
But I had 10 cases of these
babies made just for today.

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:35.947
I'll have a little now, before
the race, some during the race,

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:38.199
And come lap 600
and that checkered flag,

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:41.990
I think we're all gonna be finishing
these puppies off in victory. Huh?

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:44.834
You got us all in the shot?
Me and the car?

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.305
So I've got this racing suit and
I've got my helmet right here,

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:49.377
just want to make sure
you can see that. Huh?

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:53.843
I've been carefully monitoring
my glucose levels.

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:57.472
So I'm really in a sweet spot
right now for sustained energy.

01:01:58.089 --> 01:02:02.014
You're the To The Max driver.
You got to drink.

01:02:03.178 --> 01:02:05.556
Maybe you should think about
those four years of back taxes

01:02:05.639 --> 01:02:07.516
that this drink
is paying for, huh?

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:11.357
Yeah, go on!

01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:12.528
- Go on!
- Come on.

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:14.444
Let's...
Drink it!

01:02:14.522 --> 01:02:15.865
- Come on.
- Come on!

01:02:16.524 --> 01:02:18.197
Drink, drink, drink!

01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:19.918
Ready, boy? Beware!

01:02:19.945 --> 01:02:21.447
Yeah!

01:02:27.535 --> 01:02:30.038
Okay. I'm gonna need some cash.

01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:31.373
What for?

01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:33.838
Supplies. For the job.

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:35.544
I thought Jimmy
and your brothers

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:37.387
were bringing
everything you needed.

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:40.345
Yeah, no, they did, I just
need a little contingency.

01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:43.268
Well, it looks like
my brothers was successful.

01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:44.344
You thirsty?

01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:47.723
No. No way.

01:02:48.056 --> 01:02:50.400
Just one. Come on.
No. No.

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:52.727
We got time. Come on.

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:55.863
Hey, gorgeous. Give me one
of those beers, will you?

01:02:56.064 --> 01:02:58.192
You want a second
one for just $10 more?

01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.902
Well, of course I do.

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:03.655
And, baby doll,
give me two packs

01:03:03.738 --> 01:03:05.411
of those gummy bears.

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:06.979
This is the Warden.

01:03:07.242 --> 01:03:08.539
All right?

01:03:09.077 --> 01:03:10.750
Now I got your

01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:14.253
napkin of demands here
of what you want for

01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:17.628
peaceful surrender
and the safe release

01:03:17.711 --> 01:03:19.759
of my guards
you're holding captive.

01:03:21.089 --> 01:03:24.935
As warden, I can, uh,
approve buying a copy of

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.228
A Dance With Dragons
for the prison library,

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:29.518
to go up on
the Game of Thrones shelf.

01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:33.272
Now, the
only problem is that, uh,

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:37.147
The Winds of Winter and A Dream of
Spring have yet to be published,

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:38.903
so those aren't available.

01:03:40.775 --> 01:03:43.779
Well, I can't do anything
about what I can't control.

01:03:49.951 --> 01:03:51.953
That is total bullshit!

01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:55.632
George R.R. Martin was supposed
to deliver The Winds of Winter

01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:57.917
to his publisher
over two years ago.

01:03:58.126 --> 01:04:00.166
I know that was
the original deadline.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.672
That's what it says here.

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:03.757
But I'm reading to you
from the Wikipedia page.

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:06.639
It also says that Martin

01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:10.814
had a grueling promotion schedule
or something, and it's interfered

01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:15.485
with his writing schedule. He's failed
to complete The Winds of Winter.

01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:19.147
That don't make no sense.

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:22.325
Those two guys who transferred
in from Federal last month

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:25.783
knew about all the new stuff with
the hot chick and her dragons.

01:04:25.987 --> 01:04:27.131
No.
I'm telling you,

01:04:27.155 --> 01:04:29.249
I believe those two inmates
had that information

01:04:29.324 --> 01:04:30.667
from watching the TV series.

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:34.496
Again, I'm reading to you.
The series has jumped ahead!

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:37.166
It's no longer
following the books!

01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:40.336
O beautiful

01:04:41.336 --> 01:04:44.010
For patriot dream

01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:49.345
That sees beyond the years

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:54.016
Thine alabaster

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:57.690
Cities gleam

01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:03.200
Undimmed by human tears

01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:08.864
America

01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:15.336
America

01:05:17.038 --> 01:05:18.540
God shed

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:22.047
His grace on thee

01:05:24.212 --> 01:05:27.307
And crown thy good

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:33.226
With brotherhood

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:40.062
From sea to

01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:43.740
Shining

01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:47.994
Sea

01:05:54.534 --> 01:05:55.877
Let's blow this thing.

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:58.122
The pace car is in
and we're ready to race.

01:05:58.371 --> 01:05:59.723
Mike, it's an honor
to be able to start

01:05:59.747 --> 01:06:01.307
this 600-mile race
here on Memorial Day.

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:05.420
Boogity, boogity, boogity!

01:06:05.503 --> 01:06:06.755
Let's go racing for those

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:08.932
who made
the ultimate sacrifice, boys.

01:06:11.593 --> 01:06:14.267
D.W.'s talking about you.

01:06:18.099 --> 01:06:20.352
What, Jimmy leave us
some sort of door key

01:06:20.435 --> 01:06:21.607
for us to meet up?

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:25.240
Something like that.
Just remember one thing.

01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:28.447
Roll.
Don't hesitate, just roll.

01:06:28.776 --> 01:06:30.949
What are you talking about?

01:06:31.613 --> 01:06:33.615
What's down there?

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:34.954
Remember to roll.

01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:36.914
What the fuck?

01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:41.294
Oh, come on.

01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:43.963
Roll, roll!

01:06:47.795 --> 01:06:51.299
Now you didn't tell me
about no garbage chute!

01:06:51.633 --> 01:06:52.976
You're right.

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:20.291
Hey, hey.
It's about time. Come on.

01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:21.712
Yeah, blow me.

01:07:21.788 --> 01:07:23.599
Aw, come on, Joe,
we couldn't tell you everything now.

01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:24.624
Yeah, no, no, no.

01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:27.677
Screw you both!
A garbage chute?

01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:29.884
This is what I get
for doing business

01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:32.341
with a couple of
unlucky Logans.

01:07:35.009 --> 01:07:36.352
Them's my bleach pens?

01:07:36.636 --> 01:07:39.685
Two bleach pens and a
plastic bag, as requested.

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:17.393
Give me the tube.

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:18.557
Hold on. That's it?

01:08:18.678 --> 01:08:20.645
We're supposed to believe
that that's the thing?

01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:21.894
Tube.

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:25.898
Now, are you ready?

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.654
No. No, hold on. That's it?

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:30.573
That's a plastic bag,
bleach pens,

01:08:30.898 --> 01:08:33.242
fake salt and gummy bears.
That's our bomb?

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:35.870
Don't call it a bomb.

01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:39.081
Now, how many yards
away is the vault?

01:08:39.573 --> 01:08:42.417
About 20 yards.
I don't know, maybe 30.

01:08:42.743 --> 01:08:45.087
Is it 20 or is it 30?

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:48.087
We are dealing
with science here.

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:49.917
I guess when I saw
that gummy bears

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:51.761
is our secret
ingredient to our bo...

01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:54.013
Our explosive device,

01:08:54.087 --> 01:08:55.715
that I wasn't
thinking about science!

01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:58.267
Now, you said yourself
we couldn't bring in

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:00.261
normal explosives
'cause of the security!

01:09:00.928 --> 01:09:04.273
Now, to make our bang,
we need potassium chlorate.

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:06.729
Bleach pens is
pure sodium hypochlorite.

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:11.029
Combined with the potassium
chloride in the salt substitute,

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:14.613
we have created
an equal exchange of ions.

01:09:14.942 --> 01:09:18.446
Sugar, plus potassium chlorate

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:20.122
yields...

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:28.794
...two gasses and

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:32.135
a solid.

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:35.634
Now, you throw in some heat,
you get energy.

01:09:35.962 --> 01:09:38.886
Energy means light, explosion,

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:41.469
or, as I like to call it...

01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:44.805
...the Joe Bang.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.649
What? You thought
I was going to use

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:52.488
a stick of dynamite
or something?

01:09:55.817 --> 01:09:58.570
Well, yeah, I kinda did.

01:09:58.653 --> 01:10:00.701
Yeah, me, too.
I just figured you'd use

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.329
a lot to blow through
the thick steel walls.

01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:06.290
We don't need to
blow through the wall.

01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:09.838
Them tubes in the
venting system is our in.

01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:12.838
So, gentlemen, as I said...

01:10:14.836 --> 01:10:16.338
...are you ready?

01:10:39.444 --> 01:10:40.445
Oh, shit.

01:11:08.848 --> 01:11:10.368
- It's coming back!
- Get down!

01:11:17.231 --> 01:11:19.233
Don't move.
I'm not.

01:11:19.567 --> 01:11:20.910
And don't breathe.

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:22.237
I'm not.

01:11:35.249 --> 01:11:37.422
What are you
doing? Wait...

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:46.269
Oh. Now I see
what the problem is.

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:48.934
I twisted
the bag too many times.

01:12:12.954 --> 01:12:13.000
Keselowski on the outside

01:12:13.001 --> 01:12:14.463
Keselowski on the outside

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:16.462
and see who else
is behind him.

01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:18.259
He's not gonna
give it up that easy.

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:19.969
You can see he's pretty loose.

01:12:36.978 --> 01:12:38.321
Call it in.

01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:46.116
E Center.

01:12:49.824 --> 01:12:51.622
Well, what kind of smoke?

01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:58.003
Everything looks fine here.
We've got no alarms going off.

01:12:58.291 --> 01:12:59.668
What's going on?

01:13:00.084 --> 01:13:03.258
Concessions says they have smoke
coming out of the PT tube.

01:13:03.337 --> 01:13:05.715
If there's no fire,
why do we have smoke?

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:08.193
Let's get a couple of guys down there
and see what the hell's going on.

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.264
Yes, sir.

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:45.755
I'll go east, you go west.
Okay.

01:13:53.512 --> 01:13:57.107
Hey. Hey, it's coming
through! I can hear it!

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:09.279
All right, come on.

01:14:09.737 --> 01:14:10.937
- Come on!
- There it is, baby!

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:13.915
Come on!

01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:15.125
Woo-hoo!

01:14:15.409 --> 01:14:16.706
Come on, baby!

01:14:17.244 --> 01:14:19.246
Maybe we can
leave out of here yet!

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:22.800
Come on, Jimmy! Kick that
up a notch! Come on!

01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:26.341
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey.

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:31.267
Get it in reverse!

01:14:31.342 --> 01:14:33.142
Take it easy!
We ain't out of here yet!

01:14:45.439 --> 01:14:46.782
Oh, God.

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:49.284
What? What happened?

01:14:51.445 --> 01:14:53.118
You sucked my arm off!

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:55.040
This is your fault, not mine.

01:14:55.116 --> 01:14:56.413
You told me to turn it up!

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:57.970
You don't even know how to
operate a goddamn machine!

01:14:57.994 --> 01:14:59.680
You said put it in
reverse! I put it in reverse.

01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:00.830
You sucked his arm off!

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:02.711
Your fault. Your fault.

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:04.226
Hold on. It's in there?
It's all the way in there?

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:05.602
It's not stuck in
the tube or nothing?

01:15:05.626 --> 01:15:07.970
No. I got to
get in there and get it.

01:15:08.254 --> 01:15:11.224
Jimmy, help me get the hose off.
I'm gonna go get it myself.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.342
Come on, then Technically,
it's not your arm.

01:15:13.801 --> 01:15:16.145
Your arm you
lost over in Iraq.

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:18.894
That thing in there's
just a piece of plastic.

01:15:18.973 --> 01:15:21.601
Your arm can't be replaced
is what I'm trying to...

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:25.029
Your arm can't be replaced,
but that piece of plastic

01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:27.198
that you use as an arm,
that can be replaced.

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:29.196
Clyde, Clyde, come on. Clyde!

01:15:30.985 --> 01:15:34.455
Now, there's a lot more money
we can get out of there.

01:15:35.781 --> 01:15:38.000
We got to finish this.
Come on.

01:15:40.953 --> 01:15:42.000
You're with them?

01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:45.208
Of course he's with us.
The whole thing was his idea.

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:46.338
Yeah.

01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:48.311
Except he probably
don't wanna say that out loud

01:15:48.335 --> 01:15:51.885
'cause he knows you getting your arm
blowed off in Iraq was all his fault.

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:54.308
Everybody knows
you never would have gone

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:57.933
and joined up to fight if your big
brother wasn't the football star.

01:15:58.012 --> 01:15:59.184
- Well, that's true.
- Yeah.

01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:03.313
He was gonna be hot shit.
He was gonna play for the NFL.

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:06.612
And nobody around here
ever done anything like that.

01:16:06.687 --> 01:16:10.032
You were gonna be just another
white trash coal miner.

01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:12.109
The Logan Family Curse.

01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:15.288
Shut up! You two are idiots.

01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:19.037
Hey. We're value
added to this robbery.

01:16:19.116 --> 01:16:22.245
And if anyone has a right to be
pulling an attitude here, it's us.

01:16:22.328 --> 01:16:23.375
Yeah.

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:25.098
Oh, the Bang brothers
don't like the job?

01:16:25.122 --> 01:16:26.322
Hmm?
You got a problem with it?

01:16:26.373 --> 01:16:29.843
Yeah. You changed the date,
moved everything around.

01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:32.263
This whole job
changed dramastically.

01:16:32.338 --> 01:16:33.931
We had to change the date!

01:16:34.006 --> 01:16:35.223
You knew the terms

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:36.485
for our participating.
Mmm-hmm.

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:39.729
We needed a moral reason
to pull this job with you.

01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:42.432
Now, we was fine with you wanting
to get back at that store

01:16:42.515 --> 01:16:44.483
for messing
with your hot sister.

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:48.654
But you did a whole 360 on everything
when you moved up the date!

01:16:48.729 --> 01:16:50.572
And NASCAR
ain't done nothing to nobody.

01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:53.238
NASCAR is a beautiful thing.
NASCAR's like America.

01:16:53.317 --> 01:16:55.786
It's like you're
making us hurt America.

01:16:55.861 --> 01:17:00.458
So moving up that date was a vagrant
fliolation of our morality clause.

01:17:00.533 --> 01:17:02.376
I'll show you "vagrant"...

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:05.583
It's all good, it's all good.

01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:07.877
Shut the...

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:12.419
We need to finish this.

01:17:12.503 --> 01:17:15.052
Now, you go talk to
your brother, all right?

01:17:19.009 --> 01:17:22.229
Hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hold on, man.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:25.145
Hey, I'm your brother.

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:26.897
All right?

01:17:27.268 --> 01:17:28.861
I'm always with you.

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:30.817
I'll buy you 20 new arms.

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:33.399
A hundred,
as soon as we're done.

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:36.076
But we got to get you back
before anybody notices.

01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:38.783
All right?
So let's finish this.

01:17:39.738 --> 01:17:40.738
Okay?

01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:44.001
They'll find it and the guards will
be banging on my cell by breakfast.

01:17:44.076 --> 01:17:46.329
No, they ain't.
'Cause I'm gonna get it.

01:17:46.412 --> 01:17:49.586
I'm gonna get it,
I promise you. I swear.

01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:53.761
Am I clear?

01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:56.259
Don't let these
clowns get in your head.

01:17:57.923 --> 01:17:59.470
We all know you
want to finish first,

01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:01.185
but first you got to finish.

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:03.354
I'm getting
a lot of dirty air.

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:05.682
I got a hole,
I can push through.

01:18:19.236 --> 01:18:22.115
Hold back. It's too tight.
You're getting boxed.

01:18:25.993 --> 01:18:27.586
Whoa, I'm seeing spots.

01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:29.004
You're drifting up.

01:18:29.163 --> 01:18:31.461
My OS...
I think it's crashing.

01:18:31.749 --> 01:18:33.029
You're gonna bang in!

01:18:49.016 --> 01:18:50.108
What have you got?

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:51.276
I got nothing.

01:18:51.352 --> 01:18:53.150
Let's try B level.
All right.

01:19:23.884 --> 01:19:26.683
Hold up! Stop!
Where are you going?

01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:29.439
Garbage run.

01:19:29.515 --> 01:19:32.018
You two smell any
smoke from down there?

01:19:34.061 --> 01:19:36.189
Uh, no, 'cause we both...

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:39.151
We both lost our sense
of smells when we was little.

01:19:39.233 --> 01:19:40.280
'Cause of the, uh...

01:19:40.359 --> 01:19:41.781
The scarlet fever.
Yeah.

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:44.989
Both of us could be on fire
and not even know it.

01:19:45.072 --> 01:19:47.450
Get that thing out of here.
Okay, thank you very much.

01:19:47.741 --> 01:19:50.540
Okay. All right.

01:19:55.582 --> 01:19:57.084
Something ain't right.

01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:29.749
Whoa, whoa.

01:20:30.617 --> 01:20:31.834
What's that?

01:20:46.467 --> 01:20:48.347
Hey! Your brothers
should be back by now!

01:20:48.427 --> 01:20:50.145
Why don't you go check on 'em?

01:20:57.686 --> 01:21:00.280
You know there's
no smoking on CMS property.

01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:02.233
Oh, that's right.

01:21:02.316 --> 01:21:05.490
That's probably why they
put an ashtray in here.

01:21:09.615 --> 01:21:12.368
You still gotta put
that out and get back to work.

01:21:12.451 --> 01:21:14.749
Man, it's a three-quarter-mile
walk to get outside.

01:21:14.828 --> 01:21:18.128
I said
break time's over, Smokey.

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:24.221
You know, they call
'em 20 for a reason.

01:21:24.296 --> 01:21:27.300
And I got four minutes
to go on my 20.

01:21:28.175 --> 01:21:29.893
Are you pushing "Open"?

01:21:29.968 --> 01:21:31.470
It doesn't
say "Open", okay?

01:21:31.595 --> 01:21:33.597
It says "Start,"
but it won't open.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:34.897
Well, stop it.

01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:36.350
What?
Stop it!

01:21:38.644 --> 01:21:40.442
I thought we
wanted it to start.

01:21:40.521 --> 01:21:43.149
We do, but it needs to stop.

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:44.779
So not start?

01:21:45.859 --> 01:21:49.614
We need it to start, but we have
to stop it so I can figure out

01:21:49.696 --> 01:21:51.869
why it won't open.

01:22:04.628 --> 01:22:06.175
Oh, shit.

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:07.680
Hey, hey, hey.

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:13.308
Do you smell any smoke?

01:22:13.387 --> 01:22:15.685
Smoke? No.

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:18.859
All I smell is
them racing fumes.

01:22:20.519 --> 01:22:22.192
All right, thanks. Go ahead.

01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:27.697
Shit.

01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:31.381
- Okay, get...
- Three, two...

01:22:31.405 --> 01:22:32.645
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:34.746
Are we going on "one"
or are we going on "go"?

01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:36.118
Uh, three.

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:38.420
No, we're going on "go"!
Three, two...

01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:41.339
Hold on! Hold on!
You're gonna rip it right off the track!

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:45.590
The chain's jammed.

01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:47.008
Oh.

01:22:47.087 --> 01:22:48.259
All right.

01:22:49.089 --> 01:22:50.386
Try it now.

01:22:55.262 --> 01:22:57.105
Come on. Let's go.

01:22:57.931 --> 01:23:00.275
Let's go! Come on.
We got to get you back.

01:23:09.568 --> 01:23:11.128
Hey! Get...
Get down! I said I'd get it!

01:23:11.403 --> 01:23:12.404
Come on, let's go!

01:23:12.613 --> 01:23:15.958
You'll get it? I'll get it, I swear.
Come on. You gots to go.

01:23:17.618 --> 01:23:19.620
Let's go, big boy. Come on.
Go, go.

01:23:22.789 --> 01:23:25.292
Hey! You can't just walk away
from me. I own your ass!

01:23:25.584 --> 01:23:27.184
Not when I'm behind the wheel,
you don't.

01:23:27.252 --> 01:23:28.372
Your contract says that I...

01:23:28.462 --> 01:23:31.966
My contract says, "Love Handle
Enterprises," that's you

01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:34.009
"understands,
acknowledges and agrees

01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:35.935
"that Twin Darling,
Inc...", that's me,

01:23:36.136 --> 01:23:38.389
"...is not a partner,
employee or joint venturer

01:23:38.472 --> 01:23:40.600
"with Love
Handle Enterprises".

01:23:40.807 --> 01:23:43.310
Drivers in cars
win races, Max.

01:23:43.977 --> 01:23:46.080
Nobody's rooting for your drink
to cross the finish line,

01:23:46.104 --> 01:23:48.323
so shut your piehole
before I shut it for you.

01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:51.323
Do you know what the words
"stop payment" mean?

01:23:58.325 --> 01:24:01.329
Hey... Hey!
You're... You're that guy!

01:24:04.331 --> 01:24:06.504
Mellie should
have been back by now.

01:24:07.334 --> 01:24:11.680
Well, Aunt Mellie normally does
what she says she's gonna do.

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:13.632
Let's give her
a few more minutes

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.262
and hope she
doesn't go all Logan

01:24:15.342 --> 01:24:17.686
and become a total
flake like the rest of them.

01:24:18.345 --> 01:24:19.346
Good.

01:24:30.524 --> 01:24:31.821
All good?

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:34.699
Bumpy on the way out,
but we're doing okay.

01:24:34.987 --> 01:24:37.331
Where'd your arm go?
I mean, your hand?

01:24:37.531 --> 01:24:39.533
Can we haul ass?

01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:34.922
The cafeteria
fire alarm just went off.

01:25:35.255 --> 01:25:36.973
Warden,
we got to call this in.

01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:39.472
We don't have
fires at Monroe.

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:42.572
Sir, we don't know what kind of
shape those guards are gonna be in.

01:25:42.596 --> 01:25:45.145
I mean... They could be
dead or worse by now.

01:25:46.683 --> 01:25:48.685
And what do you
reckon be worse than dead?

01:25:50.562 --> 01:25:51.609
Uh...

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:53.440
Shit! Call it in!

01:25:53.523 --> 01:25:56.823
We have a three-alarm fire at
Monroe Correctional Facility.

01:25:56.902 --> 01:25:58.449
Please respond
immediately.

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:00.538
They report a fire
in a cafeteria.

01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:04.585
I repeat, a fire in the Monroe
Correctional Facility cafeteria.

01:27:24.489 --> 01:27:27.208
Do not tell me you've been
spraying her hair with this!

01:27:27.325 --> 01:27:29.419
This will turn her
hair into an SOS pad.

01:27:29.494 --> 01:27:32.338
I was doing the best I could!
You were late!

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:34.726
Oh, like you never brushed your
own daughter's hair before.

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:37.424
I wish you all wouldn't fight.
You're making me more nervous.

01:27:37.794 --> 01:27:39.137
You're right, baby doll.

01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:41.298
Is Daddy here?

01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:45.344
I didn't see him.
I was rushing.

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:47.346
Did your daddy
say he was coming?

01:27:47.679 --> 01:27:49.352
Yeah. Why?

01:27:50.724 --> 01:27:52.493
I don't know. I just
thought he was working.

01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:55.066
What? That job at the Speedway?
I heard he got fired.

01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.107
Funny how he
never brought that up.

01:27:59.858 --> 01:28:02.702
You look like a princess.
You're gonna do great.

01:28:20.378 --> 01:28:21.595
I thought maybe
you'd run off.

01:28:21.922 --> 01:28:24.175
And leave you,
beautiful? Never.

01:28:24.382 --> 01:28:27.977
You know, we got caught on the
other side of that there gate

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:29.896
when the lockdown happened.

01:28:30.931 --> 01:28:32.308
It was terrifying.

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:36.566
For her talent, Sadie Logan will
perform Umbrella by Rihanna.

01:29:16.268 --> 01:29:17.690
I picked this song

01:29:18.937 --> 01:29:20.610
'cause it's my
daddy's favorite.

01:29:25.944 --> 01:29:27.912
Almost heaven

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:30.699
West Virginia

01:29:31.533 --> 01:29:33.627
Blue Ridge Mountains

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:36.751
Shenandoah River

01:29:38.832 --> 01:29:40.960
Life is old there

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:43.591
Older than the trees

01:29:43.962 --> 01:29:46.886
Younger than the mountains

01:29:46.965 --> 01:29:49.059
Growing like a breeze

01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:51.887
Country roads

01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:54.473
Take me home

01:29:54.848 --> 01:29:57.351
To the place

01:29:57.767 --> 01:30:00.611
I belong

01:30:00.687 --> 01:30:03.315
West Virginia

01:30:03.398 --> 01:30:06.151
Mountain momma

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:09.078
Take me home

01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:11.828
Country roads

01:30:13.491 --> 01:30:15.994
All my memories

01:30:16.494 --> 01:30:18.872
Gathered 'round her

01:30:19.289 --> 01:30:24.716
Miner's lady
Stranger to blue water

01:30:26.755 --> 01:30:28.803
Dark and dusty

01:30:28.882 --> 01:30:31.761
Painted on the sky

01:30:31.843 --> 01:30:34.687
Misty taste of moonshine

01:30:34.763 --> 01:30:36.765
Teardrops in my eye

01:30:36.848 --> 01:30:39.647
Country roads

01:30:39.726 --> 01:30:42.570
Take me home

01:30:42.646 --> 01:30:45.399
To the place

01:30:45.482 --> 01:30:48.452
I belong

01:30:48.526 --> 01:30:50.904
West Virginia

01:30:51.363 --> 01:30:54.287
Mountain momma

01:30:54.366 --> 01:30:57.119
Take me home

01:30:57.202 --> 01:31:00.206
Country roads

01:31:00.705 --> 01:31:02.048
Where're you gonna put it?

01:31:02.415 --> 01:31:04.133
I can make a trophy case.

01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:06.257
Oh, you're gonna need to now,
you've got so many.

01:31:06.336 --> 01:31:07.679
All right.
Give me a hug.

01:31:08.213 --> 01:31:09.715
I love you, Daddy.
I love you, too.

01:31:10.423 --> 01:31:11.766
Let me see the gun show.

01:31:12.926 --> 01:31:13.973
All right.
I love you.

01:31:14.052 --> 01:31:15.554
Night, Jo.
See you, Jimmy.

01:31:16.054 --> 01:31:17.226
Come on.

01:31:17.263 --> 01:31:18.823
See you back at home, Bobbie.
All right.

01:31:21.893 --> 01:31:23.395
What the heck?

01:31:25.438 --> 01:31:27.440
What the hell
happened to my car?

01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:33.576
Are you kidding me?

01:31:45.083 --> 01:31:47.256
Hey, partner.
Where you headed to?

01:31:49.295 --> 01:31:50.638
All the way through?

01:31:50.922 --> 01:31:52.765
Mind if I
catch a ride with you?

01:31:53.133 --> 01:31:54.259
You sure?

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:45.161
Authorities have
confirmed they have recovered the money

01:32:45.185 --> 01:32:47.313
Stolen from
the Charlotte Motor Speedway

01:32:47.395 --> 01:32:49.739
in what some are calling
the "Hillbilly Heist."

01:32:49.814 --> 01:32:53.660
Sources say an anonymous caller
led police to this gas station

01:32:53.735 --> 01:32:57.410
where they discovered an abandoned
truck containing bags of cash

01:32:57.489 --> 01:32:58.866
that have been
positively linked

01:32:58.948 --> 01:33:01.121
to the robbery
over the weekend.

01:33:01.826 --> 01:33:04.295
The truck
was reported stolen last week.

01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:08.550
Our forensic team
is at work on the scene.

01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:10.252
And we 're certain
that they will find...

01:33:10.335 --> 01:33:12.588
Why go to all
the trouble to rob a place

01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:14.843
if you don't have the guts
to keep the money?

01:33:15.173 --> 01:33:16.846
He must've chickened out.

01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:21.096
Well, we are joined
now by a resident daredevil

01:33:21.179 --> 01:33:22.522
at Little Victory
Family Shelter.

01:33:22.764 --> 01:33:25.859
This is Josh Morrison.
Thank you for joining us today.

01:33:26.017 --> 01:33:27.769
Right. He comes
on about, you know...

01:33:27.852 --> 01:33:29.663
He used to come on a lot on
Midday, for Pet of the Week.

01:33:29.687 --> 01:33:32.691
So he's joining us to talk
about a new adoption challenge

01:33:32.816 --> 01:33:35.496
at the shelter for little victories.
We do have to talk about the...

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:12.147
Well, we brought everyone
in at 6:00 this morning.

01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:14.904
Couldn't work all weekend, you know,
'cause of the race, obviously.

01:34:15.316 --> 01:34:17.660
But everything was just like
we left it on Friday.

01:34:17.902 --> 01:34:19.495
How many men
do you have working today?

01:34:20.071 --> 01:34:21.493
Well, 40 or so.

01:34:21.573 --> 01:34:23.826
I guess we're on
a bit of a tight deadline

01:34:23.908 --> 01:34:26.331
'cause they're trying to
get everything shored up,

01:34:26.411 --> 01:34:28.129
since the season's starting.

01:34:28.204 --> 01:34:29.764
We'll be wrapping
out of here this week.

01:34:31.916 --> 01:34:34.089
I'm gonna need prints
from all your guys.

01:34:34.752 --> 01:34:37.346
Well, sure,
but all the workers

01:34:37.422 --> 01:34:39.516
have to wear protective
gloves at all times.

01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:41.514
That's...
Well, it's a union rule.

01:34:41.593 --> 01:34:43.436
Union rules.
Yep.

01:34:44.095 --> 01:34:45.438
Great.
Agent Grayson.

01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:48.683
Local PD got a call from someone
claiming to be an eyewitness.

01:34:48.766 --> 01:34:52.111
Swears they saw the robbers,
can definitely identify 'em.

01:34:52.770 --> 01:34:55.444
Yeah, I saw 'em.
I know who they are, too.

01:34:55.773 --> 01:34:57.533
Why don't we
start at the beginning.

01:34:57.692 --> 01:34:58.909
Where'd you see them?

01:34:58.985 --> 01:35:00.703
In a tunnel,
leading from the track back

01:35:00.778 --> 01:35:02.155
to the shower
room and the lockers.

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:04.258
There's
a saying in our business,

01:35:04.282 --> 01:35:05.829
"Set it up and shut up",

01:35:05.909 --> 01:35:07.456
so I'll shut up.

01:35:08.286 --> 01:35:10.129
What the hell was that?

01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:12.044
You call yourself a driver?

01:35:12.123 --> 01:35:14.046
What, you've never been
boxed in a turn before?

01:35:14.125 --> 01:35:15.644
I told you I didn't
want to drink your poison.

01:35:15.668 --> 01:35:16.770
I thought I was having
a heart attack!

01:35:16.794 --> 01:35:17.841
That poison...

01:35:17.921 --> 01:35:19.923
Hey, hey.
Can't one of you hit mute?

01:35:20.048 --> 01:35:22.392
I'm trying to give my
statement to the FBI here.

01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:25.933
There was two of 'em. Right?
Now one of 'em was a bartender

01:35:26.012 --> 01:35:28.561
from that place out off
of I-17. Got one arm.

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.280
The guy with him,
I don't know who he was.

01:35:30.934 --> 01:35:32.732
And you know
the bartender from?

01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:34.858
A while back,
I got in a fight at the bar.

01:35:34.938 --> 01:35:36.986
- With the bartender?
- No, with his brother.

01:35:37.065 --> 01:35:38.908
Did the brother
have one arm or two?

01:35:39.234 --> 01:35:40.656
The brother's got both.

01:35:41.819 --> 01:35:43.492
And the fight was about?

01:35:43.821 --> 01:35:45.038
I can't remember.

01:35:45.114 --> 01:35:46.991
And you won
that fight at the bar?

01:35:47.075 --> 01:35:48.292
Hell, yeah, I won it!

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:50.833
So you saw
the bartender with one arm

01:35:51.329 --> 01:35:54.424
and an unknown male companion
in the tunnel during the race?

01:35:55.166 --> 01:35:56.668
And they were?

01:35:57.001 --> 01:36:01.006
Well, they was just walking,
but it was suspicious-like.

01:36:01.673 --> 01:36:03.346
Suspicious how?

01:36:03.508 --> 01:36:06.307
They shouldn't have been down there.
That was suspicious.

01:36:06.678 --> 01:36:09.227
But you didn't think to mention
this encounter to anyone

01:36:09.305 --> 01:36:11.683
until you saw the news on the
television about the robbery?

01:36:12.183 --> 01:36:13.981
The docs had to set
my nose, all right?

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.186
I've been in recovery.

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:17.780
So all these
injuries are the result

01:36:17.855 --> 01:36:19.375
of your latest
fight with the brothers?

01:36:19.857 --> 01:36:20.949
Bartender brother.

01:36:21.025 --> 01:36:22.670
He's the one that
punched me in the tunnel.

01:36:22.694 --> 01:36:23.741
The one-arm?

01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:25.914
Yeah, look, just ask
my driver, Dayton White.

01:36:25.989 --> 01:36:27.675
Right? He was with me
when all this went down.

01:36:27.699 --> 01:36:28.825
He'll back up my story.

01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:32.453
Yes, when you called in
your tip, you mentioned

01:36:32.537 --> 01:36:34.539
that he'd be able
to corroborate your story.

01:36:35.707 --> 01:36:37.630
We spoke with
Dayton White earlier today.

01:36:38.876 --> 01:36:41.720
He stated he was never in the
tunnel with you during the race.

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:44.682
Never saw two suspicious men.

01:36:45.216 --> 01:36:47.059
And has no idea
what you're talking about.

01:37:10.575 --> 01:37:12.248
Did you talk to him?

01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:13.878
I think you knows better.

01:37:24.088 --> 01:37:26.466
I stopped by the
trailer when he wasn't home.

01:37:27.759 --> 01:37:29.636
I think I got
most of your stuff.

01:37:30.762 --> 01:37:33.106
You sure love your books.

01:37:34.098 --> 01:37:36.100
And there's some
mail there, too.

01:38:08.132 --> 01:38:09.975
Visitation logs

01:38:10.176 --> 01:38:12.850
indicate that Jimmy Logan,
an employee

01:38:12.929 --> 01:38:14.647
recently fired
from the Speedway,

01:38:15.098 --> 01:38:18.773
came with his brother Clyde
to see Joseph Bang here,

01:38:19.102 --> 01:38:20.649
on April 15th.

01:38:21.104 --> 01:38:23.152
They returned two days later
for a second visit.

01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:27.072
Now, we only have video
of this meeting, no audio,

01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:29.074
so we have no idea
what they discussed.

01:38:30.321 --> 01:38:31.914
But the following week,

01:38:31.989 --> 01:38:34.663
Clyde Logan drives through the
window of a Corner Save Mart

01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:38.379
and ends up being sentenced
to 90 days here.

01:38:39.497 --> 01:38:43.001
You seem to have a lot of information
in your FBI folders there.

01:38:45.753 --> 01:38:46.754
And so?

01:38:47.255 --> 01:38:49.508
You don't think that's
an incredible coincidence?

01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:54.853
No. Not really.

01:38:55.513 --> 01:38:59.734
I mean, if you're asking me, am I shocked
that the criminals locked up in here

01:38:59.809 --> 01:39:01.982
are friends with other criminals?
No, I'm not.

01:39:07.358 --> 01:39:10.737
So Clyde Logan and Joseph Bang
were incarcerated here

01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:12.538
at your prison
on May the 28th.

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:14.536
And you had no problems,

01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:18.207
no issues of any kind
at your prison on that day?

01:39:18.286 --> 01:39:19.458
Is that right?

01:39:19.537 --> 01:39:21.460
No, we didn't have
any problems.

01:39:21.539 --> 01:39:23.712
Right. 'Cause Monroe
County Fire Department

01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:25.151
said they
dispatched multiple units

01:39:25.209 --> 01:39:27.303
around 8:30 p.m. that night.

01:39:27.378 --> 01:39:29.346
There was
a small kitchen fire,

01:39:29.422 --> 01:39:32.301
but that's not a problem
in the context of this prison.

01:39:33.301 --> 01:39:35.099
I mean, it's
standard operating procedure

01:39:35.178 --> 01:39:38.307
for them to
dispatch multiple units

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:40.482
any time there's
a fire at the prison.

01:39:41.392 --> 01:39:45.238
That was no big deal.
It was out within a few minutes.

01:39:48.399 --> 01:39:50.618
You're certain
that these two inmates

01:39:50.693 --> 01:39:52.240
couldn't have
broken out of here,

01:39:52.570 --> 01:39:55.164
robbed the Speedway and then
broken back into your prison

01:39:55.239 --> 01:39:56.707
without you knowing about it?

01:39:57.408 --> 01:39:59.502
Wow!

01:39:59.577 --> 01:40:00.749
No.

01:40:01.579 --> 01:40:05.959
Agent Grayson, I've been warden here for
nine years and I can tell you this.

01:40:07.752 --> 01:40:10.130
We don't have
an escape problem at Monroe.

01:40:12.256 --> 01:40:13.650
What do you
think of the robbery?

01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:16.928
Well, I heard that they're
calling it "Ocean's 7-Eleven",

01:40:17.428 --> 01:40:20.602
'cause they found that truck with the
money behind a convenience store.

01:40:21.599 --> 01:40:23.952
Uh, I heard that they're
calling 'em the Redneck Robbers,

01:40:23.976 --> 01:40:25.913
'cause they think the guys
who did this whole thing

01:40:25.937 --> 01:40:28.315
are from around here.
I hope they never catch 'em.

01:40:29.106 --> 01:40:30.906
Where does
this investigation stand?

01:40:31.025 --> 01:40:32.252
Well,
let me tell you this.

01:40:32.276 --> 01:40:34.171
Even though the crime was
committed in Charlotte,

01:40:34.195 --> 01:40:36.539
the fact that
the money was recovered here

01:40:36.614 --> 01:40:38.036
makes it a very
serious matter.

01:40:38.282 --> 01:40:40.501
We're involving all
of our local, state...

01:40:41.118 --> 01:40:42.804
You have a problem
with the food here, inmate?

01:40:42.828 --> 01:40:45.832
No, no, no, Warden.
No problem.

01:40:46.791 --> 01:40:49.135
Reckon your stomach's
not been bothering you lately?

01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:51.178
No, Warden, no.

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:53.714
Thank...
Thank you for asking me.

01:40:58.970 --> 01:41:00.643
You best be
cleaning up your mess.

01:41:02.056 --> 01:41:04.058
Now!
Sir.

01:41:07.937 --> 01:41:09.029
Huh?

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:17.655
What'd you say to me, inmate?

01:41:19.824 --> 01:41:20.996
Go on.

01:41:23.828 --> 01:41:25.171
Thank you.

01:41:27.832 --> 01:41:30.381
What about the
disgruntled fired employee?

01:41:31.002 --> 01:41:32.479
The brother of
the one-armed bartender?

01:41:32.503 --> 01:41:36.053
Jimmy Logan was fired
six weeks before the robbery.

01:41:36.132 --> 01:41:38.931
His brother, Clyde, is
the one-armed bartender

01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:42.105
Max Chilblain claims to
have seen during the race.

01:41:42.179 --> 01:41:44.477
But we know there's
no way Clyde Logan

01:41:44.557 --> 01:41:46.237
could have been in
that underground walkway

01:41:46.309 --> 01:41:49.108
because he was serving time at
the Monroe Correctional Facility

01:41:49.186 --> 01:41:50.813
on the day of the robbery.

01:41:51.856 --> 01:41:52.982
Hmm.

01:41:55.526 --> 01:41:57.199
I hate airtight alibis.

01:41:58.988 --> 01:42:00.215
Where did Jimmy
Logan's cell phone

01:42:00.239 --> 01:42:01.616
tell us he was
during the race?

01:42:01.699 --> 01:42:03.542
Jimmy Logan doesn't
have a cell phone.

01:42:03.618 --> 01:42:06.087
Shut off three months
ago for non-payment.

01:42:06.704 --> 01:42:10.504
He also drives
a 1983 Ford F-150,

01:42:10.583 --> 01:42:12.130
so no GPS.

01:42:12.376 --> 01:42:14.879
No email, no social media.

01:42:15.379 --> 01:42:16.722
We did get a few
hits on his name

01:42:16.797 --> 01:42:18.265
on other social
media accounts,

01:42:18.341 --> 01:42:21.811
which place him at Valley View
High School during the race.

01:42:21.886 --> 01:42:25.516
His daughter was competing in the
Miss Pretty West Virginia Pageant.

01:42:25.598 --> 01:42:27.271
And apparently she won.

01:43:04.595 --> 01:43:06.268
How's your brother?

01:43:08.265 --> 01:43:09.892
I wouldn't know.

01:43:11.602 --> 01:43:13.775
You haven't talked to him?
Nope.

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:18.113
Not once?

01:43:18.943 --> 01:43:20.490
Nope.

01:43:22.113 --> 01:43:24.457
Well, it seems
strange, you know,

01:43:25.616 --> 01:43:28.290
you two being
so close and all.

01:43:29.954 --> 01:43:33.458
Last I heard, he moved south
to be closer to his daughter.

01:43:37.294 --> 01:43:39.046
How far south?

01:43:39.130 --> 01:43:40.302
Lynchburg.

01:43:43.634 --> 01:43:45.011
Guess his ex
moved down there

01:43:45.094 --> 01:43:48.644
when her husband
opened a new car lot.

01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:54.482
Well,

01:43:55.312 --> 01:43:57.986
if you do speak to him...

01:44:01.318 --> 01:44:03.412
Tell him I'd
like to talk to him.

01:44:03.988 --> 01:44:05.831
I doubt I'll be
talking to him.

01:44:20.337 --> 01:44:24.843
He never told you why
he gave all that money back?

01:44:34.685 --> 01:44:36.028
On the house.

01:44:39.607 --> 01:44:40.950
Generous.

01:44:44.278 --> 01:44:47.623
You've had your six months,
and you made no arrests.

01:44:48.532 --> 01:44:50.093
Meanwhile, the locals
talk about these thieves

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:52.540
like they're some type
of Hee Haw Heroes.

01:44:54.038 --> 01:44:57.793
So, we would like
to move forward

01:44:57.875 --> 01:44:59.252
and put this entire incident

01:44:59.335 --> 01:45:01.884
in our rearview mirror,
if you will.

01:45:02.713 --> 01:45:03.714
Okay?

01:45:11.305 --> 01:45:12.773
Thank you again.

01:45:14.391 --> 01:45:16.393
I do have one last question.

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:18.145
Sure.

01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:21.278
You just said you received a
payout from your insurance company

01:45:21.357 --> 01:45:23.234
for the money that
wasn't recovered.

01:45:23.317 --> 01:45:25.160
Yes. That's right.

01:45:25.611 --> 01:45:26.703
Hmm.

01:45:27.238 --> 01:45:30.583
We were here with forensic
accountants for weeks

01:45:30.658 --> 01:45:33.161
poring over the register
logs and receipts.

01:45:34.078 --> 01:45:37.002
No one here was ever able
to give us an exact accounting

01:45:37.081 --> 01:45:39.129
of how much money
was actually stolen.

01:45:39.583 --> 01:45:42.757
Right, um... It's...
Well, it's very complex.

01:45:43.087 --> 01:45:44.179
The algorithm and whatnot.

01:45:44.421 --> 01:45:46.301
Yeah, we heard about
the complicated algorithms.

01:45:47.758 --> 01:45:50.432
So how did you arrive
at the number to ask for?

01:45:50.761 --> 01:45:53.264
If you didn't know
how much was stolen.

01:45:54.431 --> 01:45:59.278
I'm not an accountant, so, uh, I
wasn't in there for those discussions.

01:45:59.770 --> 01:46:04.116
But as far as all of us here at
Charlotte Motor Speedway are concerned,

01:46:04.441 --> 01:46:07.615
the matter has been resolved
to our satisfaction.

01:46:47.318 --> 01:46:48.661
Assholes.

01:47:35.366 --> 01:47:39.542
You seriously want to trust
these two with our lives?

01:47:40.454 --> 01:47:42.627
They're gonna know
what we want 'em to know.

01:48:26.083 --> 01:48:28.085
All right!
But we can get two more.

01:48:28.168 --> 01:48:29.670
What's rule eight?

01:48:29.753 --> 01:48:30.754
"Don't get greedy."

01:48:30.838 --> 01:48:34.012
All right, you're done here. Come on,
you got to get the car anyway. Go!

01:49:27.811 --> 01:49:31.156
Yeah, you're right there. You're right
on top of it. Just dig in there.

01:49:44.995 --> 01:49:46.338
Mr. Naaman?

01:49:50.834 --> 01:49:52.802
Oh, this one's
addressed to you.

01:49:52.878 --> 01:49:55.006
Came in through
the donation box.

01:49:55.506 --> 01:49:57.850
It's heavy,
but don't get excited.

01:49:58.092 --> 01:50:01.437
It's got to be from a crazy, written
with crayon. Know what I mean?

01:50:40.551 --> 01:50:42.224
Where to, Mr. Naaman?

01:51:01.238 --> 01:51:03.036
Hey.
Hi.

01:51:04.658 --> 01:51:05.750
New job?

01:51:06.743 --> 01:51:09.087
Yeah. It's just seasonal.

01:51:09.329 --> 01:51:12.754
I hope they keep me on, though.
It's nice being close to home.

01:51:13.584 --> 01:51:15.086
You want to come in?

01:51:15.752 --> 01:51:17.254
No, no. I'll just wait.

01:51:17.421 --> 01:51:19.594
Daddy!
Hey! What's up, man,

01:51:20.007 --> 01:51:21.509
Body slam!

01:51:22.593 --> 01:51:24.266
What time you want her back?

01:51:24.511 --> 01:51:26.513
Whatever time
works best for you.

01:51:26.763 --> 01:51:28.606
We're just around.
All right.

01:51:28.682 --> 01:51:30.184
Don't wait up!

01:51:31.435 --> 01:51:34.655
All right. So I was
thinking putt-putt golf.

01:51:35.147 --> 01:51:36.990
They got those new
go-karts down there.

01:51:37.065 --> 01:51:39.443
Sure. As long as
we get gelato after.

01:51:39.526 --> 01:51:40.743
Gelato?
Yeah.

01:51:40.819 --> 01:51:42.662
Ain't that like
fancy ice cream?

01:51:42.738 --> 01:51:44.911
I thought you couldn't do that
'cause of your pageants.

01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:46.537
Oh, I'm over
all that stuff.

01:51:46.617 --> 01:51:49.712
I've been really getting into
the culinary arts lately.

01:51:49.786 --> 01:51:51.129
Oh, cula-what?

01:51:51.455 --> 01:51:54.459
Cooking! I've been
watching a lot of Top Chef.

01:51:55.417 --> 01:51:56.509
Really?
Yeah.

01:51:56.585 --> 01:52:00.806
I've been learning a lot. Like how
gelato isn't just fancy ice cream.

01:52:00.881 --> 01:52:02.849
It's made at a slower
churn rate than ice cream,

01:52:02.925 --> 01:52:04.723
so less air gets mixed in.

01:52:04.801 --> 01:52:07.304
That's why it has
such a silky texture.

01:52:07.638 --> 01:52:08.810
A churn rate, huh?

01:52:09.139 --> 01:52:12.143
Yeah, a churn rate. How fast the
paddle in the machine moves.

01:52:12.392 --> 01:52:14.895
Sometimes the paddle
is called a dasher.

01:52:15.145 --> 01:52:18.490
Oh, yeah, no,
I know what that is. A dasher.

01:52:18.815 --> 01:52:22.490
It's kinda like
Dasher and Dancer and Vixen.

01:52:22.819 --> 01:52:24.162
No, Daddy!

01:52:24.488 --> 01:52:26.490
I know exactly what that is.
No, it's not that.

01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:28.742
I didn't know that
reindeer made ice cream.

01:52:28.992 --> 01:52:30.665
They don't!

01:52:31.995 --> 01:52:33.121
You funny.

01:52:33.205 --> 01:52:34.957
You funny.
You funny-looking.

01:52:45.342 --> 01:52:48.016
You never told me how you
knew the coast was clear

01:52:48.095 --> 01:52:50.018
and we could
go get the money.

01:52:51.515 --> 01:52:53.768
Well, you know how
that phone company

01:52:53.850 --> 01:52:56.023
that give you about 60 days
to pay that phone bill?

01:52:56.353 --> 01:53:00.199
Yeah. Well, you go one clay over
and they shut your phone off.

01:53:00.524 --> 01:53:01.525
So?

01:53:04.194 --> 01:53:07.869
I ain't paid the bill out at the
trailer in like six months.

01:53:08.115 --> 01:53:09.287
So?

01:53:10.033 --> 01:53:12.877
I figured long as they was tapping
my phone, they'd keep it on.

01:53:13.203 --> 01:53:16.047
About a week ago,
it finally went dead.

01:53:19.376 --> 01:53:21.049
That's pretty good.
Yeah.

01:53:21.878 --> 01:53:23.198
You came up with
that on your own?

01:53:23.255 --> 01:53:24.347
Yes, I did.

01:53:24.881 --> 01:53:27.384
Well, that's a lot of thinking for a Logan.

01:53:39.604 --> 01:53:41.231
Hey, Jimmy.
Hey.

01:53:43.025 --> 01:53:44.368
What you doing?

01:53:46.403 --> 01:53:47.905
So, Mellie...

01:53:50.574 --> 01:53:54.920
What do you make of all
this Logan Curse stuff?

01:53:55.579 --> 01:53:59.459
Well, that's Clyde's thing. I never
really gave it that much thought.

01:54:00.584 --> 01:54:03.758
What about you? You think we're
destined to repeat the past?

01:54:06.173 --> 01:54:07.265
No.

01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:11.762
I'm all about the future.

01:54:16.099 --> 01:54:19.694
Oh, shoot. Sorry about that.
Another Especial for the lady?

01:54:19.770 --> 01:54:21.772
Yeah.
I missed out on the toast.

01:54:21.855 --> 01:54:24.779
You know they say it's bad luck
to toast with an empty glass.

01:54:25.525 --> 01:54:26.868
They do say that.

01:54:26.943 --> 01:54:29.412
It's also bad luck
to toast alone, so,

01:54:29.488 --> 01:54:31.206
why don't you pour
yourself one on me?

01:54:31.281 --> 01:54:33.033
So you don't jinx me.

01:54:36.953 --> 01:54:39.633
I would have remembered if
you'd ever been in the bar before.

01:54:41.083 --> 01:54:44.053
- Are you just passing through?
- Yeah. Passing through.

01:54:46.213 --> 01:54:48.136
But I'm hoping
to stay a while.

01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:51.973
Well, then...

01:54:53.553 --> 01:54:55.226
Here's to staying a while.
