00:04.170 --> 00:06.400
- What's this all about? Murder?
- Murder.

00:06.473 --> 00:09.704
It's imperative that neither of them
gets across the state line.

00:12.612 --> 00:14.773
Can I buckle your seat belt?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

00:14.848 --> 00:16.577
Who's driving the car?
KITT.

00:16.649 --> 00:18.947
Who's KITT?

00:20.487 --> 00:23.251
I think I'm gonna be ill.

00:24.324 --> 00:26.758
Keep this thing steady
so I can hit him!

00:26.826 --> 00:28.794
What are you doing?
Wait a minute!

00:41.708 --> 00:46.805
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:46.880 --> 00:48.905
who does not exist.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.950
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.028 --> 01:04.553
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.631 --> 01:07.657
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:07.734 --> 01:11.295
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:36.022 --> 02:38.183
Hi, guys.
Hi.

02:40.527 --> 02:43.428
What's all this?
KITT's got a brand-new feature.

02:43.496 --> 02:47.398
- I do?
- Yes. You can now construct a composite drawing on your screen...

02:47.467 --> 02:49.435
based on a verbal description.

02:49.502 --> 02:52.266
As you see,
it really is a remarkable resemblance.

02:52.338 --> 02:55.205
- Yeah. It's pretty good.
- I'm impressed.

02:55.275 --> 02:57.743
You should be.

02:58.811 --> 03:02.611
- Oh, this, uh... That's your version?
- Yes.

03:02.682 --> 03:06.448
- Frankly, there's not much hope.
- I could say the same of your wit.

03:07.854 --> 03:12.587
But I shan't. Instead, let me
present you with your next case.

03:12.659 --> 03:14.593
I... I got a problem.

03:14.661 --> 03:17.027
My dear boy, don't be so modest.

03:17.096 --> 03:19.087
You have a wide range of problems.

03:19.165 --> 03:21.759
I, uh... I got a call
from Albuquerque.

03:21.834 --> 03:24.268
- From whom, may I ask?
- Cheryl Burns.

03:24.337 --> 03:27.101
She's in jail there.
She asked if I could help her out.

03:27.173 --> 03:29.573
You know she's a good
friend of mine. I see.

03:29.642 --> 03:32.304
Remember Wilton Knight saying,
"One man can make a difference."

03:32.378 --> 03:35.279
- Yes. Indeed, I do.
- Okay. I knew there'd be no objections.

03:35.348 --> 03:37.612
Thanks a lot.
Just a minute.

03:37.684 --> 03:40.778
You can have two days.
Then I want you back on this case.

03:40.853 --> 03:42.616
You got it. Two days.

03:44.357 --> 03:46.348
Bye, Bon.

05:20.553 --> 05:22.111
Michael.
Hi, baby.

05:22.188 --> 05:23.587
Thank God.

05:23.656 --> 05:27.251
Thank you for coming.
I'm so glad to see you.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.922
It's okay now.
It's okay.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.830
Oh, baby.
What happened, huh?

05:35.068 --> 05:37.434
Michael...
Michael, it's like a nightmare.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.267
The police are convinced
that I killed my boss.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.774
Michael, you know me.
You know I'd never do anything, right?

05:42.842 --> 05:44.935
I know, I know.
It's all right. It's all right.

05:45.011 --> 05:49.277
No, it's not all right. No one will
believe me, and no one will listen to me.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.783
I'll listen.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.945
What happened?

05:55.021 --> 06:00.015
Um, we were working late
for, like, the 10th night in a row.

06:00.093 --> 06:03.221
He was always keeping me late
for something.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.890
So finally I asked him for a raise.

06:05.965 --> 06:09.526
And he said if I wanted a raise,
I'd have to earn it.

06:09.602 --> 06:11.627
Then he started pawing me.

06:14.474 --> 06:18.308
What'd you do? I ran out of
the office. That's what I did!

06:18.378 --> 06:21.313
The next morning, the janitor
found him with a fractured skull...

06:21.381 --> 06:23.315
and my desk lamp
next to him.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.351
Oh, God.

06:25.418 --> 06:27.511
All right. All right.

06:29.655 --> 06:32.590
Where'd you go... Where'd you go
right after you left the office?

06:32.658 --> 06:37.789
Um, I walked around for a while, and then
I went into a bar called the "Bent Arm."

06:37.864 --> 06:41.459
The Bent Arm.
Can anybody prove you were there?

06:42.535 --> 06:44.969
Well, I talked to this guy
named Marty.

06:45.037 --> 06:49.770
He was real nice. He listened to me
talk about my problems for hours.

06:49.842 --> 06:52.333
This guy Marty, he, uh...
He have a last name?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.846
He tell you anything about himself?

06:54.914 --> 06:57.940
No. Just that,
uh, he's an accountant,

06:58.017 --> 07:00.076
and he likes to gamble.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.178
What's he look like?

07:02.255 --> 07:06.555
He's about 5'9". He has light
brown hair thinning on top, glasses.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.428
Kinda reminded me
of Woody Allen.

07:10.496 --> 07:13.021
The, uh, police can't find him, huh?

07:14.434 --> 07:16.800
Tsk. So you don't have an alibi.

07:20.640 --> 07:25.805
Michael, I'm so scared. This
is an awful place. The people...

07:25.878 --> 07:29.609
I know. I know, baby, I know.
Don't you worry, okay?

07:29.682 --> 07:33.345
What else can I do? If my lawyer can't get
the trial date pushed back, I'm finished!

07:33.419 --> 07:37.378
You're not finished. Now,
I promise you. I'm gonna find this guy.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.585
And what if you don't?

07:40.660 --> 07:42.924
If I don't, I'll, um...

07:42.995 --> 07:45.964
If I don't, I'll rob a bank
and I'll get tossed in here,

07:46.032 --> 07:48.500
and we'll get
a beautiful coed cell together.

08:28.641 --> 08:32.008
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.409
- What can I get you?
- Beer will be fine.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.744
- Draft?
- Yeah. That's perfect.

08:38.484 --> 08:42.078
- Looks like fun, huh?
- If you like holding hands with an ape.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.350
Uhhh, no thanks.

08:45.424 --> 08:47.358
You know, a friend of mine
told me about this place.

08:47.426 --> 08:49.360
Maybe you know him.
He's an accountant.

08:49.428 --> 08:52.022
Name's Marty.
I don't know any Martys.

08:52.098 --> 08:54.293
Well, he's a little guy...
You know, brown hair, glasses?

08:55.368 --> 08:57.893
- I said I don't know 'im.
- Well, that's too bad.

08:57.970 --> 09:01.030
I was hoping to find out where he
is these days. I owe him some money.

09:01.107 --> 09:04.907
Sounds like a guy who used to
come in here, but he moved out of town.

09:04.977 --> 09:07.707
- You know where he went?
- Sorry. I don't remember.

09:07.780 --> 09:10.305
Did you say you wanna wrestle?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.317
Hey, Butch!

09:12.385 --> 09:14.649
This guy's next.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.779
Butch?

09:16.856 --> 09:18.847
All right.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.495
Hey, KITT. There's an outgoing phone call.
See if you can get me the number, huh?

09:32.071 --> 09:34.266
How you doing there, Butch?

09:37.810 --> 09:39.744
Yeah. Hello, Marty?
It's Kim.

09:39.812 --> 09:41.746
Hey. There's another guy here
looking for you.

09:41.814 --> 09:44.248
He says he owes you money.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.478
No. I didn't tell him anything.

09:48.054 --> 09:50.420
Okay, Marty.

09:50.489 --> 09:53.686
You take care of yourself, kid.
Bye-bye.

09:54.994 --> 09:58.430
You're gonna go, pally.
You got nothin' left!

09:58.497 --> 10:01.489
- Michael, I've traced the number you requested.
- What?

10:05.171 --> 10:07.935
His watch was talking!
I heard it!

10:09.709 --> 10:11.643
Better luck
next time, Butch.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.645
I'll keep an eye out for your friend.
Never mind.

10:21.087 --> 10:23.078
Excuse me.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.019
Excuse me.

10:27.426 --> 10:31.487
Not a very cooperative fellow, is he?
No, he isn't.

10:35.034 --> 10:39.027
Uh, I hate to bother you, but could you move
your truck a couple feet so I can get out?

10:41.374 --> 10:45.003
Sorry, buddy. The city only gives me
45 minutes for lunch,

10:45.077 --> 10:50.037
and I ain't gettin'back in that truck
until then. You understand?

10:50.116 --> 10:52.175
Yeah, I understand.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.146
- Yeah, KITT?
- Michael, can I be of assistance?

10:59.425 --> 11:01.825
Yeah, buddy.
As a matter of fact, you can.

11:01.894 --> 11:04.089
Go for it.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.360
Hey! Hey, hey!
What's the big idea?

11:11.437 --> 11:14.429
Hey! Holy mackerel!

11:15.574 --> 11:18.668
That's city property!
You can't do that to city property!

11:22.682 --> 11:24.616
What about that phone number, huh?

11:24.684 --> 11:27.676
I traced it to an apartment building
on Mayfield Road.

11:27.753 --> 11:31.245
Mayfield Road. Where's that?
Claremont Bay,

11:31.323 --> 11:36.056
which is approximately 474 miles
north-northwest of our current location.

11:36.128 --> 11:38.119
Well, then set a course
for Claremont Bay.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.688
Michael, I'm not certain
who the call was made to.

11:40.766 --> 11:43.530
There's no guarantee
we'll find Marty at that address.

11:43.602 --> 11:46.901
I know. Well, there's an old expression
I learned when I was a cop.

11:46.972 --> 11:49.702
- What's that?
- "A lead is a lead."

11:50.710 --> 11:52.701
Besides,
it's a beautiful day for a drive.

11:59.852 --> 12:03.288
KITT, we can cut a hundred miles off
this trip by going through the desert.

12:03.355 --> 12:06.415
Let's hit it.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.744
Is there any further information
you can provide?

12:26.812 --> 12:28.473
Sorry, buddy. That's all I know.

12:28.547 --> 12:32.244
Although the data is relatively sketchy,
the composite can be computed.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.513
Well, let's see it.

12:36.021 --> 12:37.147
Voila!

12:37.223 --> 12:40.158
- Can I go home now?
- No.

12:40.226 --> 12:43.218
I'd really like to be
of some assistance to you. Honest.

12:43.295 --> 12:47.322
But, heh, I really don't think
I can be of any use to you.

12:47.399 --> 12:48.832
I'll be the judge of that.

12:48.901 --> 12:51.165
Look, Marty,

12:51.237 --> 12:54.695
we know all about your work
at Falcon Enterprises.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.833
In fact, we'd like
a firsthand glance...

12:56.909 --> 12:59.469
at some of that creative
bookkeeping you're so famous for.

12:59.545 --> 13:03.845
I don't know what you're talking about.
He's talking about selling hot merchandise,

13:03.916 --> 13:06.851
of sending stolen goods
across state lines,

13:06.919 --> 13:09.149
and lots of other good things.

13:09.221 --> 13:11.212
Including illegal accounting. No, no.

13:11.290 --> 13:14.418
I... I... I don't know anything
about that. Honest.

13:16.095 --> 13:19.929
You do.
On a stack of Bibles, right?

13:21.867 --> 13:25.894
Listen, Marty, I'm giving you a chance
to help me and to help yourself.

13:25.971 --> 13:29.270
Now, I need those books
to make a case against your boss.

13:29.341 --> 13:32.777
Now, if you get 'em for me,
maybe, just maybe,

13:32.845 --> 13:34.779
we can cut a deal.

13:34.847 --> 13:36.576
I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.583
I... Wait, wait. Just think about it.

13:38.651 --> 13:42.109
We'll keep in touch.

13:42.188 --> 13:44.122
Can I go now?

13:44.190 --> 13:47.125
Sure. But if I were you,
I wouldn't leave by the front way.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.855
I'd go out the back door.
You know what I mean?

13:52.531 --> 13:56.934
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go on, before I change my mind.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.993
Yeah. Go on!

14:00.306 --> 14:02.240
What do we do now?

14:02.308 --> 14:04.242
We watch him like a hawk.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.403
All we gotta do
is keep the pressure on him.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.912
He's almost ready to crack
right now.

14:08.981 --> 14:12.576
Well, he better, or we'll never
get this case to the grand jury on time.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.685
We're here.

14:23.762 --> 14:25.696
You sure this is the place?

14:25.764 --> 14:28.733
Michael, are you questioning
my navigating capabilities?

14:28.801 --> 14:31.269
I was just asking.

14:31.337 --> 14:33.601
You want
apartment number 247.

14:33.672 --> 14:35.765
Okay, buddy. Thanks a lot.
Hang in here.

14:35.841 --> 14:38.810
- This shouldn't take too long.
- I've heard that before.

14:51.357 --> 14:55.350
Don't make a move. Now, just
turn around and start walking.

15:05.671 --> 15:07.901
Now, what were you doing
at Marty Keene's apartment?

15:07.973 --> 15:10.567
You know, that's the sixth time
you've asked me that question.

15:10.643 --> 15:13.578
Well, there's gonna be a seventh time
until I get the right answer.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.240
I told you. I got a friend on trial for
murder. I need Marty Keene to testify.

15:16.315 --> 15:18.249
I heard all about that.

15:18.317 --> 15:21.616
Now, what I want you to tell
me about is Falcon Enterprises.

15:21.687 --> 15:23.621
I've never heard of Falcon Enterprises.

15:23.689 --> 15:27.591
Now, I'm not trying to
cause you trouble, believe me.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.254
Well, you are causing trouble,
whether you want to or not.

15:30.329 --> 15:33.765
- What's going on here, anyway?
- Well, that's on a need-to-know basis.

15:33.832 --> 15:38.428
Look. All I need is to get Marty Keene to
Albuquerque to testify. Then he's all yours.

15:38.504 --> 15:41.940
I'm out of your hair. You know,
I really wish I could help you.

15:42.007 --> 15:43.941
But, see, you and I want the same man.

15:44.009 --> 15:46.773
Now, in this town,
I'm bigger than you are,

15:46.845 --> 15:48.870
so guess who gets what he wants?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.882
You're making a real big mistake.

15:50.950 --> 15:56.183
No! You're making a big mistake when you think
you can waltz in here and do as you please!

15:56.255 --> 15:57.950
You got it?

15:58.023 --> 15:59.991
Look at me!

16:00.059 --> 16:02.391
Now, I hope that look means "yes."

16:04.630 --> 16:06.962
Get him out of here.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.023
Come on.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.572
Hello, Marty.

16:21.647 --> 16:25.242
Hi, Mr. Farlan. Oh, now,
what is with the "Mr. Farlan"?

16:25.317 --> 16:27.251
I told you to call me Al.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.413
Right, Al.

16:30.489 --> 16:33.583
They said you wanted to talk to me.
What can I do for you, Marty?

16:33.659 --> 16:35.923
Uh, well, you know,

16:35.995 --> 16:39.089
as you know, I've been working here
for some time, Mr. Farlan,

16:39.164 --> 16:43.931
and I think I've done a pretty good job
of making this operation look legit.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.335
Are you serious?

16:46.405 --> 16:48.771
You've been a genius.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.775
I'll tell you what.
To appreciate your services,

16:50.843 --> 16:52.777
I'm gonna give you a 10 % raise.

16:54.346 --> 16:59.181
Oh. Well, that's...
That's very generous of you, Mr...

16:59.251 --> 17:01.446
Ooh. A-Al.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.012
Al. But, uh,

17:05.089 --> 17:08.526
I was thinking more along the lines
of a little time off.

17:08.594 --> 17:10.528
Oh. How much time
would you like?

17:10.596 --> 17:13.190
How about the rest of my life?

17:13.265 --> 17:17.223
Marty, don't make jokes with me.

17:17.301 --> 17:19.270
I need you to do those books.
You know that.

17:19.338 --> 17:22.898
Mr. Farlan, I...
I think the pressure's getting to me.

17:22.974 --> 17:25.307
My nerves can't handle it.
What if I make a mistake?

17:25.377 --> 17:29.507
Then we're all gonna be in a fix!
Now, Marty, you underestimate yourself.

17:29.581 --> 17:32.243
You're just under a little
too much pressure. That's all.

17:32.317 --> 17:34.251
As soon as
we clear out this inventory,

17:34.319 --> 17:37.413
I'm gonna send you to Acapulco,
all expenses paid.

17:37.489 --> 17:39.582
Until then, you just relax.

17:39.658 --> 17:41.990
Everything's gonna be fine.

17:52.671 --> 17:55.265
- Picking up any sign of him yet, KITT?
- Not as yet, Michael.

17:55.340 --> 17:58.639
Perhaps we're barking up the wrong tree,
as they say.

17:58.710 --> 18:01.873
No. Lieutenant Dickerson
mentioned Falcon Enterprises.

18:01.947 --> 18:04.643
There's gotta be some connection
between here and Marty Keene.

18:07.319 --> 18:09.844
Michael, I think I've made
a positive identification.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.550
- Where do you see him?
- Coming out the side door.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.569
I think we found our man.

19:15.787 --> 19:19.348
Wonder where he's going?
I'll be right back.

20:11.410 --> 20:14.538
Oh, you're looking good.
All right! You're looking good! Ha ha!

20:14.613 --> 20:17.104
Excuse me.
You're Marty Keene, aren't you?

20:17.182 --> 20:20.208
Hey. Will you...
Will you guys leave me alone?

20:20.285 --> 20:23.448
I'm just a little guy.
I don't know a thing.

20:23.522 --> 20:27.515
Marty, I just wanna talk to you for a
minute. Well, I don't want to talk to you.

20:28.860 --> 20:32.557
Marty, just a minute.
Come on! I just want to talk to you!

20:32.631 --> 20:34.656
- Ohh!
- Nice catch.

20:46.378 --> 20:49.973
You know, I have a really hard time
understanding people like you, Knight.

20:50.048 --> 20:53.313
Why? I'm just trying to keep
an innocent lady out of jail.

20:53.385 --> 20:56.513
I told you to stay away
from Marty Keene.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.920
Yeah, well, you never
gave me a very good reason.

20:58.991 --> 21:01.255
I don't have to give you a reason, friend.

21:01.326 --> 21:05.956
Let's just say that my department has put too
much time and effort into this investigation...

21:06.031 --> 21:10.832
to have it all go down the tubes
because of some self-appointed hero!

21:10.902 --> 21:13.700
Now, are you getting my drift,
Mr. Knight?

21:13.772 --> 21:17.299
Yeah. I get your drift. You do what you
have to do. I'll do what I have to do.

21:17.376 --> 21:19.105
Fine! Fine.

21:19.177 --> 21:24.672
Because from this moment on, my men have
orders to lock you up if you interfere.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.486
- Yeah, I'll remember that.
- Yeah. You see you do.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.015
Nice catch.

21:47.706 --> 21:51.972
Michael, wouldn't it be more advantageous to go
to the local D.A. and arrange for extradition?

21:52.044 --> 21:54.069
I don't think so, KITT.
It'd take too long.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.137
But perhaps he'd overrule
Lieutenant Dickerson...

21:56.214 --> 21:58.739
and allow us to transport Marty
back to Albuquerque.

21:58.817 --> 22:02.412
Remember what Dickerson said?
This is his turf; he calls the shots.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.648
I don't see that man
giving us any help at all.

22:04.723 --> 22:06.987
In that case,
my microwave jammers are ready.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.994
All right.

22:10.062 --> 22:11.927
Showtime!

22:20.339 --> 22:23.433
Dink, call somebody to come down
and check this out. This is ridiculous.

22:29.781 --> 22:32.614
Here comes our call, Michael.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.954
Standard Power Company.

22:37.022 --> 22:42.619
Yeah. Listen, could you get a guy over to Falcon
Enterprises, 1322 Crescent, as soon as possible?

22:42.694 --> 22:46.721
We got some kind of a power
foul-up over here. Be right there.

22:46.798 --> 22:50.165
Keep your micro-jam going,
okay, KITT?

22:50.235 --> 22:52.362
Be back in a little while.
Don't blow a fuse, huh?

22:52.437 --> 22:55.372
On the contrary,
the sensation is quite intoxicating.

22:55.440 --> 22:58.273
Well, try and stay sober
until I get back.

23:15.660 --> 23:19.255
Oh, uh, the outlet's
on the wall over there.

23:23.001 --> 23:26.437
Hey. Wait a minute.
You're the guy from the gym!

23:26.505 --> 23:29.804
Hey! What do you want with me? Just sit
down. I wanna ask you a couple of questions.

23:29.875 --> 23:31.900
Marty, you met a girl in Albuquerque.

23:31.977 --> 23:35.674
A bar called the Bent Arm.
Her name was Cheryl.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.681
Right?
Pretty smile. Brunette.

23:38.850 --> 23:42.342
- Yeah. W-What's this all about?
- Murder.

23:43.688 --> 23:45.155
Murder?

23:45.223 --> 23:48.420
Dink, what has that repairman
got to do in Marty's office?

23:48.493 --> 23:51.485
Beats the hell outta me.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.632
Gee, I... I'd like to help you,

23:58.703 --> 24:01.763
but I don't think Mr. Farlan
would let me go with you.

24:01.840 --> 24:05.173
- Why not?
- Well, because.

24:05.243 --> 24:07.734
What kind of business
is Falcon Enterprises, anyway?

24:07.813 --> 24:09.872
Hey! Hey, you can't
look at that.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.041
Why not, Marty?

24:13.819 --> 24:16.982
Is that why the cops are onto you?

24:17.055 --> 24:19.717
We better take care of them
while we have the chance.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.434
I... I don't think
this is such a good idea.

24:37.509 --> 24:39.568
It's all right.
Trust me. Come on.

24:59.097 --> 25:01.156
Come on!

25:05.504 --> 25:07.836
All right. Shut the door.
Shut the door.

25:16.581 --> 25:18.276
Go!

25:22.420 --> 25:24.354
Go, go!

25:35.000 --> 25:37.992
KITT, get in here fast.
We need your help.

26:04.963 --> 26:06.897
KITT.

26:07.899 --> 26:09.958
Get in here on the double, buddy.
I need you.

26:22.547 --> 26:25.573
What took you so long?
I came as quickly as I could.

26:28.086 --> 26:31.112
KITT, Marty's gone.
Let's get out of here.

26:39.898 --> 26:43.595
Look at this place!
It's a disaster area.

26:43.668 --> 26:45.863
Well, there's no sign of Marty.
What about the other guy?

26:45.937 --> 26:47.598
Oh, there's no way
I was gonna catch him.

26:47.672 --> 26:51.039
We gotta find Marty before
he gets to the cops and spills his guts.

26:51.109 --> 26:54.306
Now, look,
nobody disappears into thin air.

26:54.379 --> 26:57.109
Well, I don't care!

26:57.182 --> 27:01.414
Now you listen. It's imperative that
neither of them gets across the state line...

27:01.486 --> 27:03.613
under any circumstances.

27:05.624 --> 27:09.458
All right. Okay.
You keep me posted.

27:10.729 --> 27:13.323
What happens now?

27:13.398 --> 27:15.798
We gotta find Marty before Farlan does.

27:15.867 --> 27:17.801
Come on.

27:20.138 --> 27:23.733
Well, to be honest,
uh, no, not really.

27:23.808 --> 27:25.833
Well, then, what do you want?

27:25.910 --> 27:28.401
Maybe you can help me out.
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.744
Maybe you know him.
Uh, Marty Keene.

27:30.815 --> 27:33.784
Oh, sure.
Marty's my special project.

27:33.852 --> 27:37.015
In a couple of months, that
pussycat's gonna be a real tiger.

27:37.088 --> 27:39.022
You have an idea where I might find him?

27:39.090 --> 27:42.150
Sorry. He was here, but he left.

27:42.227 --> 27:44.491
Is there some special place he goes to?

27:44.562 --> 27:47.156
Well, I really wouldn't know.
We're not that close.

27:47.232 --> 27:48.927
All right. Thanks a lot.

28:02.614 --> 28:04.548
You can come out now, Marty.

28:04.616 --> 28:06.709
I don't want you
to get too sunburned.

28:06.785 --> 28:09.276
Oh! You poor thing!

28:12.290 --> 28:15.384
Devon, things aren't going
as well as I expected.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.291
I may need an extra day or two.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.455
Well, it's perfectly all right with me.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.466
However, at this point,
time is a luxury you can't afford.

28:22.534 --> 28:26.231
What do you mean? I've just received a
telephone call from Cheryl's attorney.

28:26.304 --> 28:29.296
The judge has refused them
a continuance.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.467
I'm afraid Cheryl
goes on trial tomorrow.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.410
Oh, no.

28:36.481 --> 28:38.472
Come on, KITT.
We gotta find him.

28:43.288 --> 28:46.416
He ain't here, Boss.

28:46.491 --> 28:48.459
No-good little twerp.

28:48.526 --> 28:53.259
I give him a chance to make more money than he's ever
made in his life, and this is the way he thanks me.

28:53.331 --> 28:55.265
You want me
to trash this place?

28:55.333 --> 29:01.067
No. We better get out of here. He may have
the cops on us already... No-good fink!

29:48.153 --> 29:51.816
Boy, am I dumb.
Where are we going?

29:51.890 --> 29:55.121
Back to Marty's apartment. Michael,
my analysis of human behavior...

29:55.193 --> 29:58.685
suggests that the last place
Marty would hide is his own residence.

29:58.763 --> 30:01.596
Perhaps you'd care to explain the logic
behind your decision.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.600
KITT, it's more like reverse logic.

30:03.668 --> 30:06.432
Nobody would expect Marty
to hole up in his own apartment.

30:06.504 --> 30:09.564
So maybe Marty figures
nobody will bother checking there.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.370
I'd have to say that's a long shot.

30:11.442 --> 30:15.344
Maybe, but right about now,
it's the only shot we got.

30:17.916 --> 30:20.180
Nothin'.

30:21.352 --> 30:24.617
Well, there goes our case,
right down the toilet.

30:25.857 --> 30:27.950
Maybe the blues
turned up something.

30:28.026 --> 30:30.017
Knight's car
is awfully hard to miss.

30:31.362 --> 30:33.387
Yeah. Well, I hope so.

31:07.198 --> 31:10.759
Okay, KITT. I'm gonna need
a boost about 25 feet up.

31:10.835 --> 31:13.133
Certainly, Michael.

31:27.018 --> 31:30.749
- Ahhh. Thanks, KITT.
- Don't mention it.

31:37.295 --> 31:40.958
Oh, uh, sorry.
I, uh, forgot my key.

31:41.032 --> 31:43.296
Oh!

32:36.354 --> 32:39.289
Wait a minute.
You're not getting away this time.

32:39.357 --> 32:42.292
You okay?

32:42.360 --> 32:44.123
You sure?

32:44.195 --> 32:47.460
All right. I just wanna
ask you a few questions.

32:47.532 --> 32:51.366
Marty, how'd you get involved with
Falcon Enterprises in the first place?

32:53.037 --> 32:55.972
I... I took the job,
'cause I owed a lot of money.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.133
I didn't know
it was a fencing operation.

32:58.209 --> 33:01.576
Honest! When I saw what was going on, I
tried to quit, but Mr. Farlan wouldn't let me!

33:01.646 --> 33:05.309
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
Calm down. Just sit down, relax.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.419
I'll get you out of this mess,

33:09.487 --> 33:11.751
but you've gotta come back to
Albuquerque with me and testify.

33:11.823 --> 33:15.259
I'll do anything... anything...
To get out of this jam.

33:15.326 --> 33:18.261
Great. Soon as we steal your
accounting books, we're outta here.

33:18.329 --> 33:21.196
What? Are you crazy?

33:22.433 --> 33:25.266
Not me! No way!
You got no choice, Marty.

33:25.336 --> 33:29.170
We gotta get the evidence on your boss, or
the police are never gonna let us leave town.

33:29.240 --> 33:32.368
Cheryl's trial starts tomorrow
morning. But that's illegal.

33:32.443 --> 33:36.573
That's why the police can't break in
and steal 'em. We can.

33:36.647 --> 33:39.741
There's one thing
you still don't seem to understand.

33:39.817 --> 33:42.513
- What?
- I'm a coward.

33:50.995 --> 33:54.624
We'll-We'll never make it.
It's gonna be daylight pretty soon.

33:54.699 --> 33:56.792
You're right.
Better get crackin'.

34:03.541 --> 34:07.409
KITT, when we go in, if we're not
back in one hour, call the police, huh?

34:07.478 --> 34:10.447
Be careful, Michael.
Aren't I always?

34:10.514 --> 34:12.540
You don't want me
to answer that question.

34:12.617 --> 34:15.085
Who you talking to?

34:15.152 --> 34:18.418
Oh, uh, I'll explain later.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.422
Are you a ventriloquist?

34:39.677 --> 34:41.668
Okay. Come on,
come on, come on.

34:50.288 --> 34:53.018
I got it. I got it. It's all
right. Okay. Shh! Shh! Shh. Shh.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.616
I'm up. I'm up.
Okay. Here I go.

34:59.530 --> 35:02.260
Come on, Marty!

35:12.577 --> 35:14.636
Quick. Come on.

35:17.715 --> 35:19.649
Come on.

35:20.651 --> 35:23.313
Whoa.

35:23.387 --> 35:26.584
Damn. KITT? KITT?

35:26.657 --> 35:29.421
Is everything all right?
No!

35:29.494 --> 35:31.655
Well, I'm sorry. Sorry.
It's all right. Forget it.

35:46.577 --> 35:49.341
Michael, I've been spotted
by one of the guards.

35:50.581 --> 35:52.572
Michael?

36:10.635 --> 36:12.159
What the...

36:15.907 --> 36:17.966
How'd it do that?

36:21.646 --> 36:24.308
Mr. Farlan, you better get over here.
Something funny's going on?

36:28.152 --> 36:30.552
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I can't go through with it.

36:30.621 --> 36:32.555
Sure you can.
No, no, no. I'm too nervous.

36:32.623 --> 36:34.921
Come here. Shh. Calm down,
Marty. Wh-What are we doing here?

36:34.992 --> 36:36.926
Just sit down here, okay?

36:36.994 --> 36:38.928
Close your eyes.
What for?

36:38.996 --> 36:41.590
I'm gonna take you out of this
environment. Close your eyes.

36:41.666 --> 36:44.760
Okay, now picture yourself
on a sailboat off the coast of...

36:44.835 --> 36:46.769
No, no. No, not a sailboat.
I'd get seasick.

36:46.837 --> 36:48.771
Don't be negative.
You're not getting seasick.

36:48.839 --> 36:51.774
You're on a sailboat... close your eyes...
Off the coast of a tropical island.

36:51.842 --> 36:55.778
You're with your favorite girl, the girl
of your dreams. Who's that? Alice Melkin.

36:55.846 --> 37:00.442
Alice Melkin. She's lying on the bow
of the boat, swaying to and fro.

37:00.518 --> 37:03.214
She's beautiful. She's beautiful.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

37:03.287 --> 37:06.415
You're rubbing hot oil all over
her shoulders, back and forth.

37:06.490 --> 37:07.548
Oh, boy.

37:07.625 --> 37:11.061
It's a beautiful day.
The hot sun makes everything romantic.

37:11.128 --> 37:14.928
Yeah. Ohh. She turns to
you. She says, "I love you."

37:31.048 --> 37:34.245
Here. This is all we need.

37:34.318 --> 37:37.082
Grab 'em.
Okay.

37:37.154 --> 37:39.588
Are we going now? Okay.

37:39.657 --> 37:41.488
Shh. Let's go. Come on.

37:48.165 --> 37:50.759
Get going, pal.
It's light outside.

37:50.835 --> 37:53.827
Stay low and don't
trip over anything.

38:05.950 --> 38:09.181
Well, well.
How very nice of you to drop by.

38:09.253 --> 38:11.778
Mr. Farlan, this isn't what it looks like.

38:11.856 --> 38:15.883
Aw, knock it off, Marty. You're not
gonna weasel your way out of it this time.

38:15.960 --> 38:19.157
I imagine the cops will give you
a very nice bonus for that set of books.

38:19.230 --> 38:21.562
I'm not working for the police.

38:21.632 --> 38:25.728
Oh, no? That's too bad.
I hear they give very good funerals.

38:25.803 --> 38:28.829
Now, if you don't mind,
I believe you have my property.

38:28.906 --> 38:31.636
This is the police! You are surrounded!

38:31.709 --> 38:33.870
Throw down your weapons
and put your hands over your heads!

38:33.944 --> 38:36.242
Okay, go.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.179
I told you it moved by itself!
Get in, Marty!

38:38.249 --> 38:40.649
Great timing, KITT.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.485
Get the guards on the phone! Quick!

39:06.110 --> 39:08.408
Can I buckle your seat belt?

39:08.479 --> 39:11.676
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Who's driving the car? KITT.

39:11.749 --> 39:13.683
Who's KITT?
Don't worry about it.

39:13.751 --> 39:16.049
I am worried about it!
I am worried about it!

39:16.120 --> 39:18.111
Drive the car!

39:28.766 --> 39:31.530
- What is all this stuff?
- It's a computer, Marty.

39:31.602 --> 39:35.333
Yeah, but h-how does it
manage to drive itself?

39:36.340 --> 39:38.399
It just does.

39:38.476 --> 39:40.774
Yeah. And I suppose it talks too.

39:40.845 --> 39:44.804
On a variety of subjects.
What do you care to discuss, Mr. Keene?

39:46.484 --> 39:49.715
You're not a ventriloquist.
Never said I was.

39:50.988 --> 39:52.922
Hey. Hey.
What are you doing?

39:52.990 --> 39:55.424
Punching up radar scan.
What's their distance, KITT?

39:55.493 --> 39:57.586
Approximately 400 yards.

39:57.661 --> 40:00.562
Shouldn't we accelerate
or do you want them to catch us?

40:00.631 --> 40:04.089
No, buddy. I just want them
to think they can catch us.

40:04.168 --> 40:06.227
Michael, I'm not sure I understand.

40:06.303 --> 40:08.669
We've got the books.
Why don't we just go to the police?

40:08.739 --> 40:11.264
That's the next step. See if
you can pick up police frequency.

40:11.342 --> 40:13.333
I wanna talk to
Lieutenant Dickerson.

40:22.920 --> 40:25.388
Yeah. This is Dickerson.

40:25.456 --> 40:28.050
Lieutenant,
this is Michael Knight.

40:28.125 --> 40:31.925
Knight? How did you
get a police frequency?

40:31.996 --> 40:35.796
I'll explain later, but I got Marty Keene
and all the books from Falcon Enterprises.

40:35.866 --> 40:37.663
Where do you
want 'em delivered?

40:37.735 --> 40:41.136
All right, Knight. What kind
of stunt are you up to now?

40:41.205 --> 40:44.868
I'm not trying to pull any stunt,
Lieutenant. I'm just trying to help.

40:47.044 --> 40:49.205
I'll be at the end of Highland Road.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.477
Okay?
You got it.

40:53.684 --> 40:55.982
You think he's on the level?

40:56.053 --> 40:58.180
There's only
one way to find out.

40:59.824 --> 41:04.921
Unit 17, Unit 12, respond to a 4-16,
east end of Highland Road by the docks.

41:04.995 --> 41:08.021
Repeat. East end of Highland Road
by the docks.

41:23.714 --> 41:26.308
Hang on, Marty!

41:43.634 --> 41:46.467
They're shooting at us!

41:46.537 --> 41:48.971
It's okay, Marty.
KITT's bulletproof.

41:49.039 --> 41:51.166
Wow.

42:04.588 --> 42:08.046
Hold on! Whoop! Whoa!

42:14.365 --> 42:17.357
Will you try to keep this thing steady
so I can hit him?

42:17.434 --> 42:20.198
I get the feeling all the bullets in
the world aren't gonna stop that car.

43:10.020 --> 43:14.582
- What's the matter now?
- There's something I gotta tell you.

43:14.658 --> 43:16.592
I get carsick.

43:16.660 --> 43:18.355
What do you mean you get carsick?

43:18.429 --> 43:20.693
Well, sometimes...

43:20.764 --> 43:25.531
if-if, you know, the car is moving,
and there's a lot of motion, I...

43:25.603 --> 43:27.764
Just hang in there, Marty.
Just hang in.

43:53.464 --> 43:56.991
Ohhh!

44:05.943 --> 44:09.242
Pretty great, huh?

44:20.257 --> 44:22.282
Here he comes.

44:23.293 --> 44:26.057
Michael, I'm picking up an obstruction
a half a mile ahead.

44:26.130 --> 44:28.928
That should be Dickerson.

44:28.999 --> 44:31.763
What are you doing?
Just sit tight. You'll see.

44:36.774 --> 44:38.901
Look. That truck up ahead.

44:38.976 --> 44:42.776
Marty, when I count to three, hold your
breath. What are you doing? Wait a minute!

44:42.846 --> 44:45.940
One, two,

44:46.016 --> 44:48.041
three!

45:09.973 --> 45:13.272
All right. Let's go. Come on.
And spread 'em. Spread 'em.

45:13.343 --> 45:15.573
Come on. Come on!
Spread 'em.

45:17.481 --> 45:20.575
Okay. You're under arrest, Farlan. Under
arrest? For what? You've got nothing on us!

45:20.651 --> 45:25.111
That's not true. We've got all the
evidence we need to put you away.

45:25.189 --> 45:28.124
You got all the evidence you need,
Lieutenant, right there.

45:30.661 --> 45:33.095
Uh, thanks, Knight.

45:33.163 --> 45:36.929
Uh, I guess
I was a little rough on you, huh?

45:37.000 --> 45:39.662
Well, maybe a little.

45:39.737 --> 45:43.173
Uh, I'm sorry, kid.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.936
Uh, I guess it's just part of my style.

45:46.009 --> 45:49.274
I just wanted to thank you
for everything you did.

45:49.346 --> 45:51.940
Oh, let's go, Marty. Come on.
You're part of this package too.

45:52.015 --> 45:54.779
Wait a minute. Yeah. Wait a minute,
Lieutenant. This was all Marty's idea.

45:54.852 --> 45:56.945
If it weren't for him,
you wouldn't have the books.

45:57.020 --> 46:00.114
He's willing to help put your
boss away. Aren't you, Marty?

46:00.190 --> 46:02.715
Yeah. A-Absolutely.

46:02.793 --> 46:05.728
Really? On one condition, that is.

46:05.796 --> 46:09.562
And what might that condition be? You let
him come back to Albuquerque to testify.

46:10.968 --> 46:13.664
I can live with that.
Thank you.

46:13.737 --> 46:15.967
Let's go, Marty.

46:17.474 --> 46:20.102
I'll have him back
before you know it. Okay.

46:33.590 --> 46:36.081
You look beautiful.
Thank you.

46:36.160 --> 46:39.425
How does it feel to be free
again? Absolutely wonderful.

46:39.496 --> 46:42.522
This had to be the most frightening
experience of my life.

46:42.599 --> 46:45.762
Yeah, well, it's okay now, huh?
Besides, they found the real murderer.

46:45.836 --> 46:47.770
Mm-hmm.

46:47.838 --> 46:51.274
I'll never be able to thank you
for believing in me.

46:51.341 --> 46:53.332
It's okay.

46:58.448 --> 47:02.578
Uh, hey. What about me?

47:04.221 --> 47:06.155
Oh, well, thank you too, Marty.

47:08.992 --> 47:12.723
- I hope you learned a lesson.
- Oh, boy. You better believe it.

47:12.796 --> 47:15.060
From now on, I'm sticking to the track.

47:15.132 --> 47:17.066
I have better luck with the ponies.

47:17.134 --> 47:20.228
Hey. Do you know
who's running tomorrow?

47:20.304 --> 47:23.239
I want you.
Oh. Uh, hi there, Butch.

47:23.307 --> 47:25.901
Mm. Let's go.
Yeah. Ah.

47:25.976 --> 47:28.240
Right up here.
KITT. KITT!

47:29.313 --> 47:32.749
You can talk to your watch
all you want this time.

47:32.816 --> 47:35.580
I know you're a
ventriloquist. You ready now?

47:35.652 --> 47:38.314
You ready! Go!
Aaaah!

47:56.440 --> 48:00.774
Michael Knight,
a lone crusader in a dangerous world,

48:00.844 --> 48:03.142
the world of the Knight Rider.
