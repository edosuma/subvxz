00:14.704 --> 00:16.187
- When I was first
approached to do

00:16.222 --> 00:18.190
the documentary, I was
a little apprehensive,

00:18.225 --> 00:20.744
obviously being a
former police officer

00:22.988 --> 00:25.059
and they said why don't
just take a meeting

00:25.094 --> 00:29.822
and see if you guys, you
know, get on the same page.

00:29.857 --> 00:31.859
And I spoke to him.

00:31.893 --> 00:34.034
I told him if we were
to move forward

00:34.068 --> 00:36.312
with this, it could not
under any circumstances

00:36.346 --> 00:38.797
be a puff piece and you know,

00:38.831 --> 00:39.936
there might be
people calling you

00:39.970 --> 00:41.558
a scumbag, piece of shit

00:41.593 --> 00:43.146
as well as people
saying you deserve

00:43.181 --> 00:45.217
a second change and
he was okay with that.

00:45.252 --> 00:47.357
So, once I found out
he was okay with it

00:47.392 --> 00:49.911
and it wasn't going
to be a puff piece,

00:49.946 --> 00:51.120
I decided, you know, I think

00:51.154 --> 00:53.605
it would be a good idea
doing my due diligence

00:53.639 --> 00:55.469
on what actually happened.

00:55.503 --> 00:57.850
Once we decided to
move forward, I really

00:57.885 --> 01:01.302
dug in and did my due
diligence on the case

01:01.337 --> 01:06.273
and realized that a lot
of stuff that I perceived

01:06.307 --> 01:10.070
was through tabloids
and the newspaper

01:10.104 --> 01:14.108
and a lot of other people
had the same perception.

01:14.143 --> 01:16.973
So basically, it's my
job and hopefully

01:17.007 --> 01:19.493
when you leave here,
you have an opinion

01:19.527 --> 01:20.390
of other either way.

01:20.425 --> 01:22.323
That he either deserves
a second chance

01:22.358 --> 01:25.464
or he got out because
he is who he is.

01:25.499 --> 01:26.293
- How you doin'.

01:26.327 --> 01:27.121
My name's Lillo.

01:27.156 --> 01:28.571
I'm an addict.
- Hi, Lillo.

01:28.605 --> 01:31.056
- You know, I went from
the kid in the Bronx Tale.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.196
You know, rising star
from the neighborhood.

01:33.231 --> 01:37.994
Starring in the classic
movie to a junkie.

01:38.028 --> 01:40.790
- Five a.m.
December 10th, 2005.

01:40.824 --> 01:43.482
Off duty New York police
officer, Daniel Enchautegui

01:43.517 --> 01:45.415
responded to what sounded
like a break in

01:45.450 --> 01:46.727
at a neighbor's home.

01:46.761 --> 01:48.729
The burglary erupted
into a gun fight

01:48.763 --> 01:50.386
with Broncato and
his accomplice.

01:50.420 --> 01:52.215
- They said the
police officer is dead.

01:53.630 --> 01:56.150
He was villainized in
the press immediately.

01:56.185 --> 01:57.841
- We all
remember Lillo Brancato.

01:57.876 --> 02:00.154
He was such a rising star.

02:00.189 --> 02:02.984
Acted with De Niro,
James Gandolfini.

02:03.019 --> 02:05.780
But his career came to a
screeching halt one night

02:05.815 --> 02:07.989
when he was involved
in a crime that ended

02:08.024 --> 02:10.163
with a police officer dead.

02:14.306 --> 02:16.929
- So Lillo, tell me
about how it was growing

02:16.964 --> 02:18.379
up in Yonkers.

02:18.414 --> 02:19.449
How about your childhood?

02:19.484 --> 02:21.037
Family and all that stuff.

02:21.071 --> 02:22.383
- We were very middle class.

02:22.418 --> 02:24.074
Blue collar family.

02:24.109 --> 02:25.835
It was a very tight knit
community.

02:27.630 --> 02:29.942
It was all, it was all Italian.

02:29.977 --> 02:32.013
It was all Italians
with the exception

02:32.048 --> 02:34.430
of my next door neighbor
which was Puerto Rican.

02:34.464 --> 02:36.259
But pretty much,
it was all Italian.

02:38.227 --> 02:40.229
There was a lot goin'
on in the streets.

02:40.263 --> 02:43.128
You know, we were playin'
stick ball, football.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.165
Lot of that goin' on.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.822
Parents yellin' from the
window to get inside.

02:47.857 --> 02:51.481
You know, yeah, it was a
really, really good childhood.

02:51.516 --> 02:53.621
Lot of great memories
from my childhood.

02:53.656 --> 02:56.969
- Was there ever type
of drug use back then?

02:57.004 --> 02:57.936
Not with you.

02:57.970 --> 03:00.041
Did you ever witness
any of that stuff

03:00.076 --> 03:02.285
or was that even a thought or--

03:02.320 --> 03:04.391
- Absolutely not, absolutely.

03:04.425 --> 03:06.116
I mean, you would hear
about things, you know,

03:06.151 --> 03:09.775
in cautionary things,
cautionary stuff in school.

03:09.810 --> 03:11.708
- Right.
- You know about drugs,

03:11.743 --> 03:13.710
but that's something that
wasn't really prevalent

03:13.745 --> 03:16.575
in my life or something
that I ever witnessed.

03:16.610 --> 03:19.233
Or I really never
paid attention to it,

03:19.268 --> 03:21.891
only until later on in my
life when it, you know,

03:21.925 --> 03:25.929
the opportunity to do drugs
started presenting itself.

03:25.964 --> 03:27.862
- You're on Jones Beach one day

03:27.897 --> 03:30.071
with your brother--

03:30.106 --> 03:33.765
- Yeah, brother, like I was
like maybe 10, 15 of us.

03:33.799 --> 03:35.042
- Uh huh,
then what happened?

03:35.076 --> 03:36.768
- It was the day after
Fourth of July.

03:36.802 --> 03:40.599
July fifth, 1992, and
you know, we just decided

03:40.634 --> 03:41.738
let's go to the beach tomorrow.

03:41.773 --> 03:44.500
We used to go out to
Jones Beach, field four

03:44.534 --> 03:46.191
and that's a drive.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.917
Yonkers with traffic, it could
take you

03:47.951 --> 03:50.230
an hour to get out there,
sometimes even more.

03:51.127 --> 03:52.128
So we went out there.

03:52.162 --> 03:54.337
We just went out,
school just ended,

03:54.372 --> 03:57.167
so this is the beginning
of summer vacation

03:57.202 --> 03:59.239
and little did I
know that that day

03:59.273 --> 04:02.172
on the beach was gonna
totally change my life.

04:02.207 --> 04:04.520
Now, I had heard
about The Bronx Tale

04:04.554 --> 04:07.799
and I heard that there
was open call auditions

04:07.833 --> 04:10.284
and that they were
looking for someone

04:10.319 --> 04:12.700
with no previous
acting experience

04:12.735 --> 04:14.978
to play Robert De Niro's son

04:15.013 --> 04:16.428
and a film called A Bronx Tale

04:16.463 --> 04:19.466
which Robert De Niro would
make his directorial debut.

04:20.743 --> 04:22.986
And you know, to go
back to what I

04:23.021 --> 04:25.955
was just sayin',
I thought in my mind,

04:25.989 --> 04:27.163
that would be pretty
interesting,

04:27.197 --> 04:29.648
being that people tell
me that I look like him,

04:29.683 --> 04:31.305
but I said, naw,
there's now way I'll

04:31.340 --> 04:32.237
ever be in a movie.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.033
I mean, it's a movie
on the big screen.

04:35.067 --> 04:38.174
Where the long shot, middle
class, blue collar family,

04:38.208 --> 04:40.487
it just doesn't
happen every day.

04:40.521 --> 04:42.523
And my brother, I hear
my brother screaming.

04:42.558 --> 04:44.801
I didn't know what happened.

04:44.836 --> 04:46.631
I ran out of the water
and my brother said,

04:46.665 --> 04:48.149
"hey, you know, remember
that movie we heard

04:48.184 --> 04:49.875
"about, that
Robert De Niro movie?

04:49.910 --> 04:52.153
"Well, this guy, he's out
here right, he's out here

04:52.188 --> 04:53.638
"on the beach today
looking for kids

04:53.672 --> 04:55.053
"to play the part and I told him

04:55.087 --> 04:56.157
"that you look like him."

04:56.192 --> 04:58.021
And the guy's name
is Marco Greco

04:58.056 --> 05:00.472
and my brother,
and the guy said,

05:00.507 --> 05:02.440
he told my brother,
"you're right, he

05:02.474 --> 05:03.303
"does look like him."

05:04.752 --> 05:07.030
And I just kind rose
to the occasion.

05:07.065 --> 05:09.343
I knew, I knew this was my shot.

05:09.378 --> 05:11.552
So, he didn't have to
ask me to do anything.

05:11.587 --> 05:13.105
I just started
doin' the face and

05:13.140 --> 05:15.280
the whole thing and
are you talkin' to me

05:15.315 --> 05:16.730
and the guy's like oh
wow, this guys' great.

05:16.764 --> 05:17.800
I love this guy.

05:17.834 --> 05:20.423
So, it was a Sunday, July fifth.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.736
He said usually we're closed

05:22.770 --> 05:24.254
at the Belmont Playhouse.

05:24.289 --> 05:26.705
"Usually we're closed
today, but I like you."

05:26.740 --> 05:29.225
he goes, can you meet
me in the Bronx tonight

05:29.259 --> 05:33.091
at this time and for
some reason, I just knew.

05:33.125 --> 05:37.337
I knew on the ride home
from the beach, I

05:37.371 --> 05:40.616
just knew that something
was gonna happen

05:40.650 --> 05:43.273
from this situation.

05:43.308 --> 05:45.206
I went home, I told my mom.

05:45.241 --> 05:46.691
It was my next door
neighbor's birthday.

05:46.725 --> 05:48.727
My aunts were there
and then, ah, you know.

05:48.762 --> 05:50.936
Her son read for the
part and she was like,

05:50.971 --> 05:53.145
oh, you know, so and
so read for the part.

05:53.180 --> 05:54.077
You're not gonna get it.

05:54.112 --> 05:55.734
They've got so many kids reading

05:55.769 --> 05:56.942
and you know, it's big.

05:58.254 --> 06:00.532
So I said, well,
I can only try, right.

06:00.567 --> 06:02.500
So, I went in that night.

06:02.534 --> 06:04.156
My two friends drove
me down there

06:04.191 --> 06:06.814
and the guy, Marco, was there,

06:06.849 --> 06:09.886
and I'd never seen anything
in the screen play,

06:09.921 --> 06:11.025
in screen play form.

06:11.060 --> 06:12.855
The guy just gave me the scene

06:12.889 --> 06:14.788
and he said, "have you
ever done this before,"

06:14.822 --> 06:16.445
and I said, "no, I've
never done this before."

06:16.479 --> 06:18.654
he said,
"well, here's the scene.

06:18.688 --> 06:20.276
"Just read it, see what it is

06:20.310 --> 06:21.829
"and I'll come
back in a little bit.

06:21.864 --> 06:22.727
"Let me know when you're ready

06:22.761 --> 06:23.969
"and you'll read it."

06:24.901 --> 06:26.455
And I remember
just lookin' at it

06:26.489 --> 06:28.008
and just looked like something

06:29.112 --> 06:31.839
that was familiar to
me and something

06:31.874 --> 06:34.980
that I possibly would
be capable of doing.

06:35.015 --> 06:37.638
It was the bathroom
scene when I'm shaving.

06:38.812 --> 06:41.401
In the original script, De
Niro's shaving

06:41.435 --> 06:43.610
and I ask him, dad, let
me ask you a question

06:43.644 --> 06:45.784
about the interracial dating,
you know.

06:45.819 --> 06:47.683
What his thoughts were on that

06:47.717 --> 06:50.858
and the whole thing and
that was the audition scene.

06:50.893 --> 06:53.171
And I read it and I
just knew what to do.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.276
It just seemed like it
came naturally to me

06:55.311 --> 06:57.002
and I told the guy,
Marco, I'm ready

06:57.037 --> 06:58.659
and I read it and the
guy was blown away.

06:58.694 --> 07:00.385
He was like, wow,
that was great.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.456
That was the best
anyone's ever read it.

07:04.078 --> 07:05.563
And then he started asking
me to do other scenes.

07:05.597 --> 07:07.254
He said, "why don't
you try this scene,"

07:07.288 --> 07:08.876
and, "do this scene."

07:08.911 --> 07:12.673
And the character in the
movie, his name was Calogero.

07:12.708 --> 07:15.642
My father's Sicilian
and so is the character.

07:15.676 --> 07:19.162
My father is from the
province of Agrigento

07:19.197 --> 07:21.958
in Sicily in a little town
called Naro

07:21.993 --> 07:24.271
and in Italy, you have a
lot of these little towns

07:24.305 --> 07:26.998
that have saints that
come from that town.

07:27.032 --> 07:28.033
- Right.
- The saint from

07:28.068 --> 07:29.759
my father's town
was San Calogero

07:29.794 --> 07:32.590
and my father even went to
the reform school, San Calo,

07:32.624 --> 07:34.454
when they used to shorten it.

07:34.488 --> 07:37.284
But you know,
just for like that part,

07:37.318 --> 07:40.045
that role in that movie
was just meant for me.

07:40.080 --> 07:40.874
- It was all lined up.

07:40.908 --> 07:42.220
- Yeah, all the stars aligned

07:44.256 --> 07:45.430
and I was like, wow, man.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.639
He was like, that was great.

07:47.674 --> 07:51.436
Then we exchanged
numbers and he said right

07:51.471 --> 07:53.127
before I left,
he said, "call me in

07:53.162 --> 07:54.163
"about a week," you know.

07:54.197 --> 07:55.544
"Call me in about a week
or so and I'll tell you

07:55.578 --> 07:56.648
"how you did."

07:56.683 --> 07:59.271
And he said a week, that
seemed kinda distant.

08:00.203 --> 08:01.688
Maybe I thought
maybe he didn't like me

08:01.722 --> 08:03.379
as much as I thought
he liked me.

08:04.345 --> 08:06.658
I was working for
a lawyer at the time.

08:06.693 --> 08:08.522
It was my summer vacation,
summer job.

08:08.557 --> 08:09.937
I was filing.

08:09.972 --> 08:10.973
My father's a builder.

08:11.007 --> 08:13.493
The lawyer was did the
closings for my father,

08:13.527 --> 08:15.218
so he was a family
friend and took on

08:15.253 --> 08:16.530
a summer job at his office and I

08:16.565 --> 08:19.291
used to file stuff,
answer phones

08:19.326 --> 08:20.879
and I came home
from work that day

08:20.914 --> 08:24.711
and some woman
had called on the phone.

08:24.745 --> 08:26.954
She seemed very professional
and when I heard

08:26.989 --> 08:28.542
her voice, she asked
for Lillo and that's

08:28.577 --> 08:31.338
also my father's name and
she said, "can I please speak

08:31.372 --> 08:33.823
"to Lillo Brancato," and I
said, "yeah, hold on, I'll

08:33.857 --> 08:35.445
"get my dad for you."

08:35.480 --> 08:37.861
And she said, "are you
Lillo," and I said yeah.

08:37.895 --> 08:40.347
She goes, "no, no, I think
I want to speak with you."

08:40.381 --> 08:42.107
She said, I'm so and so.

08:42.142 --> 08:44.593
I work in down in
Tribeca Casting

08:44.627 --> 08:46.940
and we saw your tape
and we loved it.

08:46.974 --> 08:49.149
We wanna meet and
we would like for you

08:49.183 --> 08:52.428
to come down and I was
like, wow, you know.

08:52.462 --> 08:54.534
Now, it's started becoming real.

08:55.776 --> 08:58.572
The next day I went down
there with my father

08:58.607 --> 09:02.058
and my uncle and was very
overwhelmed

09:02.093 --> 09:04.302
'cuz you know, like when
I go down there, I've

09:04.336 --> 09:05.786
never done, remember,
like I said, I've

09:05.821 --> 09:06.649
never done this before.

09:06.684 --> 09:07.857
I've never been to an audition.

09:07.892 --> 09:09.100
I don't know the whole process.

09:09.134 --> 09:10.964
I'm not familiar with
any of this.

09:10.998 --> 09:12.966
So, when I went down
there, my father

09:13.000 --> 09:14.795
and uncle walked
in the room with me

09:14.830 --> 09:17.557
and there was like
40 kids there reading

09:17.591 --> 09:20.767
for the part and you got
kids in the corner reading

09:20.801 --> 09:23.114
their lines, talking to
the wall like real actors.

09:23.148 --> 09:25.461
Guys that really wanna do this.

09:25.495 --> 09:27.636
I was so intimidated
and so overwhelmed

09:27.670 --> 09:30.984
by the whole thing,
but I just figured

09:31.018 --> 09:34.781
what, they liked
what I did, so I'm not

09:34.815 --> 09:35.816
gonna change what I did.

09:35.851 --> 09:37.646
I'm gonna just keep
going in that direction.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.716
Obviously they liked me.

09:38.750 --> 09:40.614
I made it to this point.

09:40.649 --> 09:42.651
So, I went in and I read.

09:42.685 --> 09:43.686
They liked me again.

09:43.721 --> 09:45.515
They said, "listen, can
you come back tomorrow."

09:45.550 --> 09:47.448
And I kept getting a
call back, call back

09:47.483 --> 09:51.383
and as that happened,
I noticed

09:51.418 --> 09:54.214
that there was a lot
less kids in the room

09:54.248 --> 09:56.009
and at that point,
everyone was introduced

09:56.043 --> 09:58.632
to me, you know,
on a first name basis

09:58.667 --> 10:00.392
and then one day they
said we're gonna

10:00.427 --> 10:01.393
go upstairs and meet Bob

10:01.428 --> 10:04.120
and I had already
met Chazz Palminteri.

10:04.155 --> 10:06.709
Seen him in the
building and he would

10:06.744 --> 10:07.572
always congratulate me.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.435
Saying thank you
for coming down.

10:08.469 --> 10:09.229
We really love what
you're doin'.

10:09.263 --> 10:10.264
Just keep it up.

10:10.299 --> 10:12.301
Very inspiring,
very inspiring stuff.

10:13.682 --> 10:16.098
And then they said we're gonna
go upstairs and meet Bob.

10:16.132 --> 10:17.202
I said okay.

10:17.237 --> 10:19.964
I just thought Bob is
maybe a script supervisor

10:19.998 --> 10:21.966
or someone, I didn't
know who it was.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.486
So, the way it was
set up, I come in

10:25.521 --> 10:26.902
through the door back there.

10:27.765 --> 10:29.352
I'm De Niro.

10:29.387 --> 10:32.114
He's got his back to me
and Chazz is right there.

10:32.148 --> 10:33.149
So, I can see Chazz.

10:33.184 --> 10:35.358
I can see his profile
and then he looked over

10:35.393 --> 10:38.741
and they said, they said,

10:38.776 --> 10:39.949
the door's a little open.

10:39.984 --> 10:40.985
It's open and,

10:41.019 --> 10:43.401
"Bob, Lillo's here to meet you."

10:43.435 --> 10:45.748
And Bob's you know,
turnin' around

10:45.783 --> 10:49.096
and then he walked over,
like you know.

10:49.131 --> 10:52.030
I mean, you can't
explain that moment

10:52.065 --> 10:54.274
in words and just like
when he came up

10:54.308 --> 10:55.862
to me and you know, I
remember he'd just finished

10:55.896 --> 10:57.967
doing a movie,
Mad Dog and Glory,

10:58.002 --> 11:01.695
so he had that reddish
hair that he had,

11:01.730 --> 11:03.559
so it wasn't like De Niro,

11:04.733 --> 11:06.562
the De Niro that I knew

11:06.596 --> 11:08.253
- Right.
- from seeing on TV

11:08.288 --> 11:09.116
but it was still De Niro.

11:09.151 --> 11:10.531
That's still the face.
- Right.

11:10.566 --> 11:13.258
- We hope they're not
fooled by his fame.

11:13.293 --> 11:15.122
He's an actor, he's acting
on that stand.

11:15.157 --> 11:17.366
- What was the
first initial reaction

11:17.400 --> 11:19.368
with other cops,
the guys who worked

11:19.402 --> 11:21.266
it when the story broke
the next morning?

11:21.301 --> 11:23.130
- It was anger, frustration.

11:25.926 --> 11:28.377
Sorrow.
- Today,

11:28.411 --> 11:31.173
if you mentioned Lillo
Brancato's name

11:31.207 --> 11:34.210
to other cops, what would
be the reaction?

11:34.245 --> 11:38.214
- I think most cops
would be hate.

11:39.284 --> 11:42.046
You know, yeah,
most cops would be

11:42.080 --> 11:43.703
just flat out hate.

11:46.257 --> 11:47.845
You know, it's just really
one of those unfortunate

11:47.879 --> 11:50.330
things that can happen.

11:51.814 --> 11:56.405
Life can be very simple,
but somehow us grownups,

11:56.439 --> 11:57.717
we can complicate things.

11:57.751 --> 12:00.789
- Mmh hmm.
- And that was

12:00.823 --> 12:03.136
the product of
something that just

12:03.170 --> 12:04.551
should never have happened.

12:06.173 --> 12:08.106
- What do
you think Pat would,

12:08.141 --> 12:09.280
what do you think his
reaction would be to this?

12:09.314 --> 12:11.765
- Pat would love his
head on a platter.

12:11.800 --> 12:15.527
- Right.
- You know, especially,

12:15.562 --> 12:17.875
Pat mentioned he
can be very animated

12:17.909 --> 12:20.325
and he's pro-cop to the max

12:20.360 --> 12:21.775
and that what's you
want in somebody

12:21.810 --> 12:23.156
that's gonna represent you.

12:24.813 --> 12:26.918
But even cops screw up.

12:26.953 --> 12:29.196
- Right.
- And there's cops

12:29.231 --> 12:33.787
that have hit bottom, whether
it be alcohol or drugs.

12:33.822 --> 12:37.549
And he's human, this is one
of the flaws of being human.

12:37.584 --> 12:39.655
- So police
officer to police officer.

12:39.689 --> 12:42.451
Why did you think it
was important to come on

12:42.485 --> 12:44.625
and do this documentary?

12:44.660 --> 12:46.110
- Because the
young police officer

12:46.144 --> 12:49.182
that lost his life did
something that I think

12:49.216 --> 12:51.632
any other police officer
would have done

12:51.667 --> 12:54.014
and it's unfortunate.

12:55.360 --> 13:00.089
Lillo Brancato is out
and living his life

13:00.124 --> 13:04.093
and still can do things and
the young officer is not.

13:05.439 --> 13:08.580
- The night the, actually
it was in the morning

13:08.615 --> 13:09.374
when it happened.

13:09.409 --> 13:11.825
It was about 5:20 a.m.

13:11.860 --> 13:14.310
I was in my crime scene office.

13:14.345 --> 13:16.209
We received a phone call
that an officer

13:16.243 --> 13:18.280
had been shot and
he was likely to die.

13:19.315 --> 13:22.180
When I got there, the scene was,

13:22.215 --> 13:24.631
there was a lot of cops
around the peripheral

13:24.665 --> 13:26.806
because there was, he was,

13:27.841 --> 13:30.257
the incident happened in
the middle of the block

13:30.292 --> 13:31.327
- Mmh hmm.
- And it went up

13:31.362 --> 13:32.708
to towards Westchester Avenue.

13:32.742 --> 13:34.503
- Mmh.
- So there were a lot

13:34.537 --> 13:36.954
of cops around the
peripheral of the scene.

13:36.988 --> 13:39.232
They had it marked off
and the cops actually

13:39.266 --> 13:42.787
did a great job in preserving
the scene

13:42.822 --> 13:45.065
because there was a lot
of snow on the ground.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.412
- Mmh hmm.
- If you were in actually,

13:47.447 --> 13:50.726
in Daniel's apartment,
you could look

13:50.760 --> 13:52.383
right out his,
he lived in a basement.

13:52.417 --> 13:53.971
You could look right
out his window

13:54.005 --> 13:57.802
and you could see
the window where Bancato

13:57.837 --> 13:59.493
and Armento tried to get in

13:59.528 --> 14:01.150
and they broke the window.

14:01.185 --> 14:02.151
It was directly across.

14:02.186 --> 14:03.118
He had a clear view

14:04.291 --> 14:06.880
and he actually went
outside and went

14:06.915 --> 14:09.400
to approach them
in the driveway.

14:10.677 --> 14:14.577
So, initially you
don't know exactly

14:14.612 --> 14:18.133
how it went down because
Armento was removed.

14:18.167 --> 14:22.206
He ran, him and Brancato ran
towards Westchester Avenue

14:22.240 --> 14:24.001
and they both left a blood trail

14:25.002 --> 14:26.935
'cuz Daniel actually
hit them with every shot

14:26.969 --> 14:28.764
the he fired.

14:28.798 --> 14:30.352
He hit the both of
them with every shot.

14:30.386 --> 14:31.387
He didn't miss them.

14:32.250 --> 14:34.390
So, a couple of the
bullets and fragments

14:34.425 --> 14:37.048
actually came out.

14:37.083 --> 14:39.602
Now, they both left
separate blood trails

14:39.637 --> 14:41.535
going down towards Westchester.

14:41.570 --> 14:44.814
Lillo actually made
it to the vehicle

14:44.849 --> 14:47.438
that I believe was a Durango.

14:47.472 --> 14:49.129
It was on the corner,
right, parked

14:49.164 --> 14:51.200
right around the
corner on Westchester

14:51.235 --> 14:52.719
and there was blood all over it

14:52.753 --> 14:54.548
and that's where the
officers had grabbed him.

14:54.583 --> 14:58.967
- Mmh hmm.
- Armento was short of that.

14:59.001 --> 15:00.451
He dumped his gun right away.

15:00.485 --> 15:02.418
He was where the
cops grabbed him

15:02.453 --> 15:07.458
and they were wearing
really thin rubber gloves.

15:08.045 --> 15:09.494
- Mmh hmm.
- I mean, you don't

15:09.529 --> 15:12.290
even see cheap gloves
like that anymore

15:12.325 --> 15:15.017
in the emergency room.

15:15.052 --> 15:17.917
These were really, really
cheap rubber gloves.

15:18.848 --> 15:20.712
And there was a couple
of them over there

15:20.747 --> 15:23.992
where Armento was
caught and there was one

15:24.026 --> 15:25.855
back at the window
sill where they tried

15:25.890 --> 15:30.999
to get in and that's where
we got Lillo's DNA from.

15:31.033 --> 15:32.586
From that particular glove.

15:32.621 --> 15:34.726
It'd be hard to get into the
jury's mind.

15:34.761 --> 15:35.831
- Right.
- I don't know,

15:35.865 --> 15:38.351
it might have come down
to how the judge explained

15:38.385 --> 15:39.248
the law to them

15:39.283 --> 15:40.663
- Mmh hmm.
- that they didn't

15:40.698 --> 15:42.527
find him guilty.
- Right.

15:42.562 --> 15:44.150
- But they found him guilty.

15:44.184 --> 15:46.428
I was satisfied that at
least they found him guilty

15:46.462 --> 15:48.637
of the burglary and he
did do some time.

15:48.671 --> 15:49.983
- Right.
- So hopefully he

15:50.018 --> 15:54.229
had time to reflect upon the
people you hang out with.

15:54.263 --> 15:56.886
- Right.
- So, I wrote

15:56.921 --> 16:01.339
on December 10th, 2005,
the assigned, being me,

16:01.374 --> 16:04.480
along with Police Officer
Demato, I was training him

16:04.515 --> 16:09.209
at the time, responded to 3117
Arnot Place

16:09.244 --> 16:12.592
to assist Detective Schwartz
with a the sheer number

16:12.626 --> 16:15.284
of the Bronx Homicide
Squad and the department,

16:15.319 --> 16:18.115
excuse me, the department
investigation

16:18.149 --> 16:20.531
of a police involved
shooting in which

16:20.565 --> 16:23.983
the North duty MOS and two
perpetrators exchanged gunfire.

16:25.467 --> 16:29.333
The off duty MOS was
removed to Jacobi Hospital

16:29.367 --> 16:33.475
prior to CSU arrival where
he expired from his wound.

16:33.509 --> 16:36.271
He was shot once in the chest.

16:38.342 --> 16:40.516
The perpetrators were
also removed to Jacobi

16:40.551 --> 16:44.624
prior to my arrival and are
reportedly in critical condition

16:44.658 --> 16:49.629
and then I described the way,
the services that I provide

16:49.836 --> 16:51.976
in terms of collecting
the evidence.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.151
I think the fact that
he was who he was,

16:55.393 --> 16:58.017
it might have had
an affect on the jury.

16:58.879 --> 17:02.538
Might have had an affect on
the way the whole case went.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.748
The same thing
if you're in a car,

17:05.782 --> 17:09.718
somebody has a gun, if the
police come and stop you,

17:09.752 --> 17:11.892
they pull you out and
you have the gun on you,

17:11.926 --> 17:14.067
the only person gets
charged is the person

17:14.102 --> 17:16.932
with the gun on them,
but if that person throws

17:16.965 --> 17:19.659
the gun down on the
floor, now everybody goes.

17:19.693 --> 17:21.005
- Right.
- It's the same

17:21.040 --> 17:22.800
with narcotics, guns.

17:23.800 --> 17:28.150
So, being that he was
involved in the burglary

17:28.185 --> 17:30.152
and a police officer
was killed, he should

17:30.187 --> 17:31.809
have been charged

17:31.843 --> 17:33.190
and that's the law.

17:34.122 --> 17:35.778
- Took me awhile to
decide to go forward

17:35.813 --> 17:36.814
in a case like this.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.403
I mean, so emotionally charged.

17:40.714 --> 17:42.751
Obviously, a police
officer is dead.

17:44.615 --> 17:46.720
He was villainized in
the press immediately.

17:46.755 --> 17:47.859
Made to be a monster.

17:48.860 --> 17:52.140
I have an astounding
respect for police officers.

17:52.174 --> 17:53.658
I've represented, as you know,

17:53.693 --> 17:55.522
- Sure.
- a lot of police officers

17:55.557 --> 17:57.214
in some very difficult times

17:58.767 --> 18:02.598
and I pride myself in helping
out members of the force

18:04.876 --> 18:06.223
when they need me.

18:06.257 --> 18:08.846
This was obviously
a difficult decision

18:08.880 --> 18:11.228
for me to make,
but it was a decision

18:11.262 --> 18:12.988
that I was able to
make pretty comfortably

18:13.022 --> 18:14.645
once I got to know
Lillo and once I got

18:14.679 --> 18:16.095
to know the facts of this case.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.200
- Sure and what
was your first impression

18:18.235 --> 18:19.546
of Lillo at that time?

18:19.581 --> 18:20.409
- A sweet heart.

18:21.307 --> 18:22.135
Really a sweet heart of a guy.

18:22.170 --> 18:23.343
Not the guy I read about.

18:23.378 --> 18:28.245
Not the arrogant, you know,
sort of abusive individual

18:29.832 --> 18:31.040
who was callous
or anything like that.

18:31.075 --> 18:35.321
He was a sweet heart who
clearly had lost control

18:35.355 --> 18:36.977
of his life,
lost control of his life

18:37.012 --> 18:39.842
in the sense that drugs
began to overwhelm him,

18:39.877 --> 18:42.293
take away the person
that he was that made him

18:42.328 --> 18:43.984
so successful as a young boy,

18:44.813 --> 18:46.435
make him so loved
by so many people.

18:46.470 --> 18:49.128
- Mmh hmm.
- A lot of people

18:49.162 --> 18:50.750
really love Lillo Brancato.

18:50.784 --> 18:52.890
A lot of people care
about Lillo Brancato

18:52.924 --> 18:55.341
and that's why,
I think, this was

18:55.375 --> 18:57.274
so shocking to so many people.

18:57.308 --> 19:00.691
But as individual as a
person, you know, look, I

19:00.725 --> 19:01.657
was a prosecutor.

19:01.692 --> 19:03.314
I've been a defense
lawyer a long time.

19:03.349 --> 19:08.008
I like to not judge people
based on Google searches.

19:08.043 --> 19:12.944
I don't judge people based
on third party analysis,

19:12.979 --> 19:15.464
but on my own
impressions and I had

19:15.499 --> 19:18.329
some tough questions for
him when I first met him,

19:18.364 --> 19:19.606
but it was clear to me that
there was

19:19.641 --> 19:23.645
a good soul inside that
sort of hardened shell

19:23.679 --> 19:26.579
that had been eroded
by years of drug abuse.

19:26.613 --> 19:28.684
After that case was
resolved, I still represent

19:28.719 --> 19:30.859
the many cops
- Right.

19:30.893 --> 19:33.137
- in their times of need,
including

19:33.172 --> 19:34.966
the so-called infamous
rape cops in New York

19:35.001 --> 19:36.830
who were acquitted of
rape after being vilified

19:36.865 --> 19:40.006
for two years in the
press as rapists.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.490
And the funny part
about that is,

19:41.525 --> 19:43.906
the same people who
were giving me

19:43.941 --> 19:45.598
a hard time during
the Brancato case

19:45.632 --> 19:47.462
were the first ones
to call me after

19:47.496 --> 19:49.740
the rape cop
acquittal telling me

19:49.774 --> 19:51.845
how much I've done
for the boys in blue

19:51.880 --> 19:54.089
and how much they
appreciated my help.

19:54.123 --> 19:56.367
So, but that's all part of being
a lawyer.

19:56.402 --> 19:57.403
I don't take it personally.

19:57.437 --> 19:58.576
Once I got to them
about the facts

19:58.611 --> 20:01.234
of the case and
the person, Lillo,

20:01.269 --> 20:04.272
it was clear to me that this was

20:04.306 --> 20:06.722
an individual who had
no legal responsibility

20:06.757 --> 20:08.276
or moral responsibility
for the death

20:08.310 --> 20:10.209
of that police officer,
as tragic as it was.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.866
Another individual did and
he's rightfully serving

20:12.901 --> 20:14.282
the rest of his life in jail.

20:14.316 --> 20:16.629
That's Armento.
- A lot of people

20:16.663 --> 20:18.389
don't realize that house
was his buddy's house.

20:18.424 --> 20:20.219
So, that's important to know.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.047
He wasn't randomly going
around the neighbor

20:21.081 --> 20:22.082
trying to break into a home.

20:22.117 --> 20:23.636
I mean, this was Kenny's house.

20:23.670 --> 20:27.087
His buddy who had
died just recently

20:27.122 --> 20:28.572
but Lillo didn't know it,
but he had been

20:28.606 --> 20:30.090
there hundreds of times before

20:30.125 --> 20:31.057
- Right.
- where Kenny supplied

20:31.091 --> 20:33.232
him with narcotics
to get his fix.

20:33.266 --> 20:34.578
He went there with
Armento that night

20:34.612 --> 20:37.408
and when he went
there, they made

20:37.443 --> 20:38.892
a sufficient amount
of noise where

20:38.927 --> 20:41.861
it's startled, awaken
the neighbor who happened

20:41.895 --> 20:43.069
to be a New York
City Police Officer.

20:43.103 --> 20:45.382
Of course,
Lillo didn't know that.

20:45.416 --> 20:47.280
Lillo didn't know Steve
Armento was carrying a gun.

20:47.315 --> 20:48.799
That was proven in the trial.

20:50.490 --> 20:53.666
And the police
officer fired first

20:53.700 --> 20:55.495
and Armento returned fire and

20:55.530 --> 21:00.362
all this was obviously
of great surprise

21:00.397 --> 21:03.434
to Brancato who was
there to do what he'd

21:03.469 --> 21:04.746
done a hundred times before.

21:04.780 --> 21:06.472
So, there was
no legal liability.

21:06.506 --> 21:08.543
I mean, it's easy
to lump it together

21:08.577 --> 21:10.338
with another individual when
a police officer's shot.

21:10.372 --> 21:12.685
That's our instinct as a
civilized society

21:12.719 --> 21:15.446
and it's right in that
sense to have

21:15.481 --> 21:16.689
a visceral reaction like that,

21:16.723 --> 21:17.966
because when a
police officer dies,

21:18.000 --> 21:19.692
it's tragic, if anyone dies,
it's tragedy.

21:19.726 --> 21:21.107
- Right.
- But someone who

21:21.141 --> 21:23.143
gave their life to
serve the community

21:23.178 --> 21:25.456
as police officers often do,

21:25.491 --> 21:28.977
it really creates
a righteous sense

21:29.011 --> 21:31.117
of indignation and outrage.
- Sure.

21:31.151 --> 21:33.015
- That's a good
visceral reaction,

21:33.050 --> 21:35.294
but we also as
a civilized society

21:35.328 --> 21:36.605
have to step back and look at

21:36.640 --> 21:38.745
the true facts and when I did

21:38.780 --> 21:40.091
in this case and
when the jury did

21:40.126 --> 21:43.336
in this case, they came to
the only right conclusion,

21:43.371 --> 21:45.614
which was Lillo Brancato
was not responsible

21:46.822 --> 21:47.858
for this police officer's death.

21:47.892 --> 21:50.309
- 2005 when the whole
incident happened, you

21:50.343 --> 21:54.243
had uniqueness of
interviewing Lillo's family.

21:54.278 --> 21:56.245
And you got to speak to his mom

21:56.280 --> 21:59.318
and what was that
whole thing like?

21:59.352 --> 22:01.527
- Well, I think that
the climate at the time

22:01.561 --> 22:03.529
as a journalist,
I remember first of all,

22:03.563 --> 22:04.875
when he got arrested,

22:04.909 --> 22:05.979
- Mmh hmm.
- and it was a few months

22:06.014 --> 22:09.328
before, it was in June
2005 when he was arrested

22:09.362 --> 22:11.744
for an uncontrolled substance

22:11.778 --> 22:12.952
- Mmh hmm.
- And I remember

22:12.986 --> 22:14.954
that made a lot of
headlines because any time,

22:14.988 --> 22:16.024
- What were you
doing it for at the time,

22:16.058 --> 22:17.232
if you don't mind me asking.

22:17.266 --> 22:21.132
- At the time, I remember
thinking I knew who he was.

22:21.167 --> 22:24.688
He was certainly someone
who had a great background.

22:24.722 --> 22:26.793
He was a New Yorker, you know.

22:26.828 --> 22:28.830
He was from Yonkers.
- Right.

22:28.864 --> 22:31.557
- And I just remember
hearing, oh, here's

22:31.591 --> 22:33.455
this guy, he got
into drug problems.

22:33.490 --> 22:35.940
He's probably another
celebrity with drug problems.

22:35.975 --> 22:37.597
We've done many
interview like that

22:37.632 --> 22:39.944
and then when I
found out what happened

22:39.979 --> 22:44.673
in December 2005,
it was shocking,

22:44.708 --> 22:47.849
but to be suddenly
charged with murder,

22:47.883 --> 22:49.057
- Right.
- and also charged

22:49.091 --> 22:52.198
with robbery was also
something very, very serious

22:52.232 --> 22:54.683
and then it became not
just another celebrity

22:54.718 --> 22:55.615
caught up in drugs.

22:55.650 --> 22:57.410
It became something
very, very serious

22:57.445 --> 22:59.447
and it was making
headlines everywhere.

22:59.481 --> 23:00.827
- Now, how
did it come to pass

23:00.862 --> 23:05.867
that you got to, months
later, interview Lillo's mom

23:06.281 --> 23:08.421
and how did that whole thing
transpire?

23:08.456 --> 23:11.424
- I knew Mel Sacks and
Mel Sacks was the attorney

23:11.459 --> 23:12.391
at the time.

23:12.425 --> 23:13.495
I knew Mel very well.

23:13.530 --> 23:15.014
I had interviewed
him many times.

23:15.048 --> 23:16.809
I'd interview many of his
clients through they years.

23:16.843 --> 23:19.432
He was probably, you know, if
not the best

23:19.467 --> 23:22.642
or one of the best for sure
criminal defense attorneys

23:22.677 --> 23:23.471
- Right.
- in the country,

23:23.505 --> 23:24.575
not just in New York

23:24.610 --> 23:26.957
and Mel and I had
a number of discussions

23:26.991 --> 23:29.166
and he reached out to
me and said, "I would

23:29.200 --> 23:31.375
"like to give
an exclusive to you

23:31.410 --> 23:35.448
"with Lillo Brancato's
mother," and I thought, wow.

23:35.483 --> 23:36.725
I'll take it.

23:36.760 --> 23:37.588
It was interesting
as a journalist

23:37.623 --> 23:39.797
because here I
was interviewing her

23:39.832 --> 23:41.765
and I was looking
right across from her

23:41.799 --> 23:43.905
and you could tell
that this was a woman

23:43.939 --> 23:47.771
who was clearly heartbroken,
who was so devastated.

23:47.805 --> 23:49.911
I thought she'd put a really
human face

23:49.945 --> 23:51.844
on Lillo Brancato
for the public.

23:52.845 --> 23:54.122
Our interview was shown
all over the world.

23:54.156 --> 23:55.848
So many people
saw that interview

23:55.882 --> 23:58.713
and the mother, I thought,
was very heartfelt.

23:58.747 --> 24:00.887
Very compassionate
and you couldn't help

24:00.922 --> 24:02.924
but feel heartbroken
for the mother.

24:02.958 --> 24:04.546
- Right.
- I remember her saying

24:04.581 --> 24:07.584
to me, "my son got a call, was
going off

24:07.618 --> 24:11.484
"to a Christmas party and
then I didn't see him again."

24:11.519 --> 24:12.899
And you could
just tell that this was

24:12.934 --> 24:15.454
this mother who
just loved her son.

24:15.488 --> 24:16.696
She adopted him
- Right.

24:16.731 --> 24:18.249
- when he was a young boy.

24:18.284 --> 24:19.872
Really cared for him

24:19.906 --> 24:21.563
and knew he got
mixed up in drugs,

24:21.598 --> 24:25.015
but was just shocked,
shellshocked by everything

24:25.049 --> 24:25.843
that was happening.

24:25.878 --> 24:27.742
Clearly, he has paid his dues.

24:27.776 --> 24:30.814
I hope he uses this
time also to inspire

24:30.848 --> 24:33.023
other children not
to take the wrong path.

24:33.057 --> 24:35.335
Not to get mixed up in drugs.

24:35.370 --> 24:37.821
And I also hope
that he uses the time

24:37.855 --> 24:39.547
to also honor
law enforcement, too.

24:39.581 --> 24:41.825
Because I think he can
have a powerful message

24:41.859 --> 24:44.310
and inspire other
kids and he's also

24:44.344 --> 24:45.656
a great actor.

24:45.691 --> 24:47.865
I admired his acting back then

24:47.900 --> 24:51.006
and I think he's,
you always want

24:51.041 --> 24:51.904
the best for someone.

24:51.938 --> 24:53.975
You want someone
to have another chance

24:54.009 --> 24:55.528
and maybe there's
an Academy award

24:55.563 --> 24:57.772
in his future, you never know.

24:57.806 --> 25:00.050
- It was one day, Robert
De Niro said to me,

25:00.084 --> 25:00.982
he said, "Lillo,
tomorrow I want you

25:01.016 --> 25:02.915
"to dress like
you're doing to church.

25:03.985 --> 25:06.574
"Wear a collared
shirt and I want you

25:06.608 --> 25:08.645
"to dress nice."

25:08.679 --> 25:10.060
He said, "we're gonna
do what's called

25:10.094 --> 25:11.199
"a screen test."

25:11.233 --> 25:12.476
Now, I didn't know what that was

25:12.511 --> 25:14.202
but you know, we're
gonna do a screen test

25:14.236 --> 25:15.893
and what we're gonna do
is we're gonna actually

25:15.928 --> 25:19.034
put you on film because film
may make you look different.

25:19.069 --> 25:20.967
It may make you look,
you know what I mean.

25:21.002 --> 25:22.935
- Right.
- And I said, yeah.

25:22.969 --> 25:23.867
No problem.

25:23.901 --> 25:26.076
I remember I wore black slacks.

25:26.110 --> 25:29.562
Button down, white button
down shirt, black shoes

25:29.597 --> 25:32.634
and I didn't know what I
was gettin' myself into.

25:32.669 --> 25:35.603
At this point in time, I
thought, you know, I'm C.

25:35.637 --> 25:39.020
I'm C, so I'm just sittin'
there, I'm so nervous.

25:39.054 --> 25:40.331
I'm just sittin' there.

25:43.127 --> 25:44.991
My father's sittin' next to me.

25:45.026 --> 25:47.960
And then, I feel
someone tap my shoulder

25:49.617 --> 25:52.102
and I look and said,
"hey, how you doin', man."

25:52.136 --> 25:54.829
And he said to me, he
said, "hey, how are ya."

25:54.863 --> 25:55.761
He goes, "I'm Phil Barbarino."

25:55.795 --> 25:57.901
He says, "I'm reading
for C also."

25:57.935 --> 25:59.316
He goes, "it's me and you."

26:00.455 --> 26:03.044
Whoo, when he told me
that I was like, oh wow.

26:03.078 --> 26:05.598
I guess I'm not the only, I
guess I'm not the only guy

26:05.633 --> 26:08.636
and I know he got to this point
because he

26:08.670 --> 26:09.740
was good also.
- Right.

26:09.775 --> 26:11.500
- There was something that
got him to this point.

26:11.535 --> 26:13.123
- Right.
- Phil Barbarino was

26:13.157 --> 26:16.298
the kid who shot Sonny
at the end of the movie.

26:16.333 --> 26:17.230
- Right.
- Initially they were

26:17.265 --> 26:19.647
gonna make him C and he was 21,

26:19.681 --> 26:21.303
so the movie would have
been a little different.

26:21.338 --> 26:24.168
It would have been him
at 21 and his friends

26:24.203 --> 26:26.170
would have been
around that age also,

26:26.205 --> 26:28.000
- Right.
- so they would have

26:28.034 --> 26:28.863
been a little older.

26:29.864 --> 26:31.900
Who, by the way,
still a very good friend

26:31.935 --> 26:34.282
of mine to this day, Phil.

26:35.179 --> 26:40.288
I remember, we did
the scene when Sonny

26:40.322 --> 26:43.325
let me borrow his
car and when I gave

26:43.360 --> 26:45.017
it back to him, he found
something under

26:45.051 --> 26:47.088
the engine, under the
hood that he thought

26:47.122 --> 26:50.056
I planted in his car
and nearly got physical

26:50.091 --> 26:52.956
with me and wanted to know
where'd you go in my car

26:52.990 --> 26:54.992
and I begged and pleaded,
Sonny, I'm sorry.

26:55.027 --> 26:56.304
I didn't do anything, I'm
tellin' ya'.

26:56.338 --> 26:57.823
I just went to pick up the girl.

26:57.857 --> 26:58.858
That was the scene.

27:00.066 --> 27:02.275
So, Phil read the scene first.

27:03.138 --> 27:04.450
Had the doors closed.

27:04.484 --> 27:05.658
All I can do is hear him.

27:05.693 --> 27:08.316
Me and my father
were right outside

27:08.350 --> 27:10.249
and all you hear is Chazz,
"where the fuck

27:10.283 --> 27:11.699
"did you go in my car!"

27:11.733 --> 27:14.702
And you hear slap, slap.

27:14.736 --> 27:18.498
You can hear him
slapping this poor guy.

27:18.533 --> 27:21.018
He's slapping the
crap out of him.

27:21.053 --> 27:22.744
What did I sign up
for here, you know,

27:22.779 --> 27:24.194
'cuz I'm thinking
after he's done, I

27:24.228 --> 27:26.161
gotta go in there and
he's gonna beat me up

27:26.196 --> 27:27.024
the same way.

27:28.129 --> 27:30.718
So, Phil came out and
he's all disheveled.

27:30.752 --> 27:31.753
His hair was messed up.

27:31.788 --> 27:33.134
His shirt was ripped.

27:33.168 --> 27:35.308
He had hand prints on his face.

27:35.343 --> 27:37.690
So, I'm like, wow, boy,
they really worked you over.

27:37.725 --> 27:38.898
They worked him over.

27:38.933 --> 27:40.417
So, I'm like, nervous.

27:40.451 --> 27:44.041
Now I'm nervous and
you're gonna beat me

27:44.076 --> 27:45.387
on top of being nervous.

27:46.734 --> 27:49.978
So, I go in there and I,
camera's roll

27:50.013 --> 27:54.017
and we did the
scene and they didn't put

27:54.051 --> 27:55.397
their hands on me once.

27:57.296 --> 27:58.849
So, all weekend I
didn't hear anything.

27:58.884 --> 28:01.127
I remember it
was a Sunday night.

28:01.162 --> 28:04.130
This lady, Robin, called
me and said, "Lillo, Bob

28:04.165 --> 28:06.339
"would like to see you
tomorrow."

28:06.374 --> 28:07.893
I said okay and I
knew this was gonna

28:07.927 --> 28:09.549
be the day.

28:09.584 --> 28:12.621
My life was gonna change
in one way or another.

28:13.899 --> 28:16.798
So, I went down
there with my father.

28:16.833 --> 28:20.077
Robert De Niro, his office
was on the eighth floor.

28:20.112 --> 28:21.458
We used to go to
the seventh floor.

28:21.492 --> 28:23.218
The eighth floor,
you needed the key,

28:23.253 --> 28:26.463
but he had like a balcony
where he could look down.

28:26.497 --> 28:30.260
So now, he would come
out, he knew my father

28:30.294 --> 28:33.746
at this point and he's such
a polite guy, Robert De Niro.

28:33.781 --> 28:35.990
He used to call
my father, Mr. Brancato

28:36.024 --> 28:37.577
and he said, "hey, how
you doin', Mr. Brancato."

28:37.612 --> 28:39.200
They used to speak in Italian.

28:39.234 --> 28:41.029
- Yeah.
- They were right around

28:41.064 --> 28:42.237
the same age, also, you know.

28:43.791 --> 28:45.516
So, he said hello to my father

28:45.551 --> 28:47.795
and he said, "Lillo, come up."

28:47.829 --> 28:50.694
So, I go upstairs
and you got Chazz

28:50.729 --> 28:53.801
and you got De Niro
and De Niro's, he's

28:53.835 --> 28:55.457
just lookin' at me
and he says, he

28:56.631 --> 28:58.978
was making his face and
he says, "well, we liked

28:59.013 --> 29:01.187
"very much what you did."

29:01.222 --> 29:02.775
Now, that was ambiguous.

29:02.810 --> 29:04.087
- Right.
- It could have been we

29:04.121 --> 29:06.779
liked very much what
you did, but you know.

29:06.814 --> 29:08.229
- Right.
- Or we like very much

29:08.263 --> 29:11.784
what you did and
you got the part.

29:15.477 --> 29:17.790
Thank you, Bobby,
you know, thank you.

29:17.825 --> 29:19.688
And to Chazz, thank you so much.

29:19.723 --> 29:22.208
I said, "is it okay if
I go tell my father?"

29:22.243 --> 29:24.141
And when I went to
tell my father, he

29:24.176 --> 29:25.936
came outside with
me to the balcony.

29:25.971 --> 29:29.526
Had his arm around me
and I told my father.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.424
I said, "Pop," I said,
"I got the part."

29:31.459 --> 29:34.427
And my father just looked
up, went like that.

29:34.462 --> 29:35.532
And I said, "you mind if I use
your phone?

29:35.566 --> 29:37.120
"I'd like to call my mother."

29:37.154 --> 29:38.673
And Robert De Niro said,
"yeah, go ahead."

29:38.707 --> 29:39.985
He said, "go use the
one in the bathroom.

29:40.019 --> 29:41.780
"You'll have a little privacy."

29:41.814 --> 29:43.540
So, I went and I
called my mother

29:43.574 --> 29:45.507
and I heard my mother screaming.

29:45.542 --> 29:47.130
My aunts were there, everybody,
they

29:47.164 --> 29:49.373
were all going crazy,
he got the part.

29:49.408 --> 29:50.167
Everybody's going
crazy, you know,

29:50.202 --> 29:52.204
'cuz my mom, she told everybody.

29:52.238 --> 29:54.585
My whole street,
everybody was outside.

29:54.620 --> 29:58.486
Balloons and people whistling,
"Lillo, congratulations!"

29:58.520 --> 30:00.419
I'm thinking to
myself, life can't

30:00.453 --> 30:01.730
get any better than this.

30:01.765 --> 30:03.077
It was like perfect, man.

30:03.111 --> 30:04.216
Like living a dream.

30:04.250 --> 30:06.839
- Biggie said it best,
more money, more problems.

30:06.874 --> 30:08.323
- Right.
- You know what I'm saying.

30:08.358 --> 30:09.531
- Right.
- You know, once you

30:09.566 --> 30:11.913
start to get in that
money and the fame

30:12.949 --> 30:14.743
and things are coming
at you real fast, you

30:14.778 --> 30:16.193
gotta keep up.
- Right.

30:16.228 --> 30:20.784
- And sometimes, trying to
keep up, you might fall.

30:21.992 --> 30:23.580
We had access to everything.

30:23.614 --> 30:26.859
We was on defjam, we
was rollin' with rush.

30:26.894 --> 30:28.067
You know what I'm sayin'.

30:28.102 --> 30:29.828
They gave us
everything we wanted.

30:29.862 --> 30:30.656
You know what I'm sayin'.

30:30.690 --> 30:32.658
To the models, the club life.

30:32.692 --> 30:35.074
Even before I met Jay, you
know what I'm sayin', I

30:35.109 --> 30:37.283
was always goin' to the clubs
and goin'

30:38.284 --> 30:41.667
to joints like Mars and
underground clubs

30:41.701 --> 30:44.532
where hip hop kids
weren't even allowed in,

30:44.566 --> 30:45.844
so I was always
dibbling and dabbing

30:45.878 --> 30:47.949
in certain crowds, but it's
always there

30:47.984 --> 30:49.019
in New York City.

30:49.054 --> 30:50.296
It's not hard to find.

30:50.331 --> 30:53.541
- I met Lillo in Italy,
in Milan Italy, I think,

30:53.575 --> 30:55.923
at a, I used to do a
little bit of print work

30:55.957 --> 30:57.407
and he did some
print work as well

30:57.441 --> 31:00.341
and so I met him back
stage at a fashion show

31:00.375 --> 31:02.205
and then I met him
again in New York City

31:02.239 --> 31:05.139
and we used to hang
around in the clubs

31:05.173 --> 31:09.039
a little bit and you
know, he's a good dude.

31:09.074 --> 31:10.454
I've never actually get crazy.

31:10.489 --> 31:13.423
I mean, he was just
of the most amiable,

31:13.457 --> 31:18.462
just very relaxed, authentic
people you wanna meet.

31:19.567 --> 31:21.569
He was just of those
kinda guys that you

31:21.603 --> 31:23.640
have an instant liking to him.

31:23.674 --> 31:25.953
You can understand
why they canst him

31:25.987 --> 31:28.472
in the film because he
was very, you know, he

31:28.507 --> 31:31.337
was likable, he is likable.

31:31.372 --> 31:35.203
I was completely taken
back because it

31:35.238 --> 31:36.722
was unlike him, you know.

31:36.756 --> 31:39.828
And when I hear more
details about the story,

31:39.863 --> 31:43.832
then I started to understand
how someone like Lillo

31:43.867 --> 31:46.490
could have found himself
in that situation

31:48.009 --> 31:52.186
and sort of guilty by
osmosis or whatever it is,

31:52.220 --> 31:55.085
but so yeah, I was surprised.

31:55.120 --> 31:57.985
Celebrities, it hijacks
the human ego

31:58.019 --> 31:59.952
and it gives people
a sense of hubris

31:59.987 --> 32:02.334
where they just feel
that they're untouchable

32:02.368 --> 32:04.267
and you know, this can't
happen to me.

32:05.302 --> 32:07.097
- How you doin', my name's
Lillo, I'm an addict.

32:07.132 --> 32:08.133
- Hey Lillo.

32:09.099 --> 32:11.032
- Paulie, thank you for sharing.

32:11.067 --> 32:15.278
You know, I know
today's topic is hope

32:15.312 --> 32:20.317
and back before I ever
came into these rooms, I

32:20.662 --> 32:22.768
didn't think was any hope, just
because of

32:22.802 --> 32:26.772
the negative stigma
attached to drug addiction

32:26.806 --> 32:29.740
and you don't want
to tell anyone.

32:29.775 --> 32:32.019
You can't really go
anywhere for help

32:32.053 --> 32:33.710
because everyone's gonna
look at you like you're

32:33.744 --> 32:37.300
a piece of shit, a piece of
garbage.

32:37.334 --> 32:41.373
And I didn't want to
really let anyone know

32:41.407 --> 32:45.032
and as a result of that,
I just kept getting deeper

32:45.066 --> 32:48.276
and deeper my addiction
to the point where I

32:48.311 --> 32:49.968
was totally powerless.

32:52.142 --> 32:55.042
There was nothing I could
do in my power to stop.

32:55.076 --> 32:57.492
I mean, it felt like there
was a magnet

32:57.527 --> 33:01.393
in my mouth pulling
the drugs and you know,

33:01.427 --> 33:05.121
as Mike said, I went
away for some time also

33:05.155 --> 33:08.848
and it's because of my
lack of self control

33:08.883 --> 33:10.609
when it came to drugs.

33:12.266 --> 33:17.236
And then when I got out
of prison, I started

33:19.721 --> 33:21.827
coming to meetings,
something that I never

33:22.828 --> 33:24.519
really did unless I was
forced to do because

33:24.554 --> 33:26.418
of some case I going, whatever,

33:26.452 --> 33:29.248
and when I first started
coming to meetings, I,

33:31.940 --> 33:35.841
the word hope was
like the word that first

33:35.875 --> 33:39.155
came to mind, because
everyone was so welcoming

33:39.189 --> 33:43.228
and you know, giving
me their phone numbers

33:43.262 --> 33:46.058
and now it's like you
have something behind you.

33:46.093 --> 33:49.303
You have a support
system to fall back on

33:49.337 --> 33:52.823
if you're ever in a
situation where you feel

33:52.858 --> 33:55.757
like you wanna use
and I thank the people

33:55.792 --> 33:57.069
in these rooms so much,

33:58.070 --> 34:01.763
because if it wasn't and
weren't for these rooms, I

34:01.798 --> 34:03.006
don't know where I'd be.

34:04.766 --> 34:07.183
So, yeah, thank you.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.703
I mean, this really
saved my life.

34:10.737 --> 34:13.016
There's nothing worse than
wasted fucking talent.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.467
You had this opportunity
of a lifetime

34:15.501 --> 34:17.295
to become who you are right now.

34:17.331 --> 34:19.056
To be, I would have done
anything to work

34:19.091 --> 34:20.817
with Abel Ferrara.

34:20.851 --> 34:21.818
I don't ever have to
work again after this.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.268
That's the way I felt.

34:23.302 --> 34:25.994
The way I saw it was, I
was still young, you know,

34:26.029 --> 34:28.721
so I was like, God, I've
lost my right to party.

34:28.755 --> 34:31.483
I lost my right to have
a good time, to be young,

34:31.516 --> 34:34.106
because I fucked with that drug.

34:34.141 --> 34:35.866
Like, that drug
was just, then you,

34:35.900 --> 34:37.109
all bets are off after that.

34:37.143 --> 34:38.420
You can't do anything anymore.

34:38.455 --> 34:39.525
Now, you have to get sober

34:39.560 --> 34:41.458
and you gotta stay sober
for the rest of your life.

34:41.493 --> 34:42.908
You don't even have
to be an addict

34:42.942 --> 34:44.116
to become an heroin addict.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.118
You just have to
take heroin five times

34:46.152 --> 34:47.395
and then you realize
you don't know

34:47.429 --> 34:51.123
how to tie your shoes after
your fifth time without out it.

34:51.158 --> 34:52.504
At least for me,
that's how it was.

34:52.538 --> 34:53.884
I don't know if I was an addict

34:53.918 --> 34:55.851
or if I, if it made
me an addict.

34:55.886 --> 34:59.925
I don't even know,
but he, I knew

34:59.959 --> 35:01.651
that it was the
beginning for him.

35:01.685 --> 35:04.205
All I know is Abel Ferrara,
- Right.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.000
- had a massive drug problem.

35:06.034 --> 35:10.142
He was, he used to direct on
his hands and knees, Abel.

35:10.177 --> 35:12.489
Hey, so I want you to do this.

35:12.524 --> 35:14.733
He'd be petting
his hair and stuff

35:14.767 --> 35:16.321
and I remember
even Lillo was like,

35:16.355 --> 35:18.875
what the fuck is this.
- Right.

35:18.909 --> 35:21.636
- How are we gonna
get anything done here.

35:22.982 --> 35:27.539
By the sixth day
of shooting, I noticed

35:27.573 --> 35:30.749
that Lillo was not the
same kid that started

35:30.783 --> 35:32.199
the movie with us.

35:32.233 --> 35:34.097
I remember we had one
scene in a horse

35:34.132 --> 35:36.582
and carriage in
central park and we

35:36.617 --> 35:38.688
were stealing shots
because, A, we

35:38.722 --> 35:43.693
were shooting, winter time,
we shooting snow storms

35:43.727 --> 35:46.834
and blizzards in winter time
for, we were

35:46.868 --> 35:47.973
in a heat wave in New York.

35:48.007 --> 35:49.802
It was that really big heat wave

35:50.838 --> 35:54.566
and this fucking guy
was puking off

35:54.600 --> 35:56.671
the side of the horse and
carriage

35:56.706 --> 35:58.639
the whole time and
I'm like, what's

35:58.673 --> 36:00.192
going on, are you sick?

36:00.227 --> 36:01.780
What's happening?

36:01.814 --> 36:03.368
And it took me a couple
minutes to realize,

36:03.402 --> 36:05.266
it's like, this kid's doing
heroin.

36:05.301 --> 36:06.440
He's doing drugs.

36:06.474 --> 36:09.167
He's fucking high
as hell right now.

36:09.201 --> 36:10.582
He's not withdrawing
'cuz he's not

36:10.616 --> 36:13.101
a junkie yet.
- Right.

36:13.136 --> 36:14.655
- He just got high.

36:14.689 --> 36:17.382
He's new at taking
heroin 'cuz I was

36:17.416 --> 36:20.661
already, I had been
already at a rehab

36:20.695 --> 36:23.181
and stuff and sober
for a few years

36:23.215 --> 36:25.079
and I was like, wow,
he was just starting,

36:25.113 --> 36:26.977
so I thought for sure he
was getting high with Abel.

36:27.012 --> 36:29.670
I was annoyed, I was
really mad at him.

36:29.704 --> 36:31.154
I was, I think I was more mad at

36:31.189 --> 36:33.052
the situation because
I knew how hard

36:33.087 --> 36:34.985
it was for me and
I'm like, don't

36:35.020 --> 36:36.987
go down this road.

36:37.022 --> 36:38.886
You have all this
opportunity in front of you.

36:38.920 --> 36:41.337
Why would you ever do this?

36:41.371 --> 36:44.029
I was still pretty fresh, so,

36:44.063 --> 36:45.789
and they're watching
Abel and it's like

36:45.824 --> 36:47.964
this is what you wanna be?

36:47.998 --> 36:49.552
This isn't like,
I'm a party animal.

36:49.586 --> 36:50.622
I'm a Hollywood actor.

36:50.656 --> 36:52.348
I've just become famous, I wanna

36:52.382 --> 36:54.660
go out and part and
enjoy the high life.

36:54.695 --> 36:57.698
This is, you must
really hate yourself.

36:57.732 --> 37:01.322
Brad Renfro died
right out of Deuces Wild.

37:01.357 --> 37:03.738
That was around the same
time period, I think,

37:03.773 --> 37:05.947
that Lillo got in trouble,
so now, you

37:05.982 --> 37:07.501
have these two really talented,

37:07.535 --> 37:10.711
and Brad Renfro
was this gentle soul.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.473
A mess, you know, so sad.

37:14.508 --> 37:16.648
And Lillo and I
reconnected this year.

37:16.682 --> 37:18.753
The reason why
I'm even here talking

37:18.788 --> 37:21.135
to this camera,
because I asked him

37:21.169 --> 37:24.449
if he would fill in
for me along with

37:24.483 --> 37:26.071
a couple of other
friends of mine

37:26.105 --> 37:29.971
who went through,
who had jail time

37:30.006 --> 37:31.697
and came out on
the other end and

37:31.732 --> 37:34.907
are trying to keep
their lives in

37:34.942 --> 37:37.185
the straight and narrow
and trying to help people.

37:37.220 --> 37:39.878
But that's when I
reached out to Lillo

37:39.912 --> 37:42.398
and I said, will you go
talk at this conference.

37:42.432 --> 37:46.505
So, my whole take
on all of this stuff

37:46.540 --> 37:48.680
as much as it was
awful and there's

37:48.714 --> 37:51.234
all this waste of
talent is that he's

37:51.269 --> 37:53.271
turning it around,
so is it wasted

37:53.305 --> 37:54.272
at this point?

37:54.306 --> 37:55.928
He's taking this
experience and he's turning

37:55.963 --> 37:59.346
it into something that
could help other people

37:59.380 --> 38:02.383
and something that's gonna
work in his favor, I hope.

38:02.418 --> 38:04.247
Put him on a different path.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.387
I always tell,
I asked him to speak at

38:06.422 --> 38:10.426
this thing, which was a,
it's a reentry program.

38:10.460 --> 38:12.635
Kids coming out, people
coming out of jail, not kids.

38:12.669 --> 38:15.603
People coming out of jail
and not having a chance.

38:15.638 --> 38:19.400
They're scarred for life by
that, so what other options?

38:19.435 --> 38:21.299
I mean, just go get
fucking high again, like I

38:21.333 --> 38:23.335
can't even be a
part of society now

38:23.370 --> 38:24.819
because I fucked up?

38:24.854 --> 38:26.545
I see it a different way.

38:26.580 --> 38:28.582
I see a lot of people
who had drug problems

38:28.616 --> 38:31.757
as being highly
sensitive people.

38:31.792 --> 38:34.139
People who forget about
even their problems,

38:34.173 --> 38:35.658
it's how you carry your problems

38:35.692 --> 38:40.352
and how you handle them
and people like us handle

38:40.387 --> 38:45.357
them in this very self
destructive kind of way,

38:45.978 --> 38:48.222
but you can turn that
into something magical.

38:48.256 --> 38:50.431
I believe that,
I really believe that.

38:50.466 --> 38:51.777
- You finished?

38:55.781 --> 38:56.610
- Thank you, T.

38:57.921 --> 39:00.338
- Was that sugarless,
motherfucker?

39:00.372 --> 39:02.305
The last fuckin' drink
you're ever gonna have.

39:03.375 --> 39:04.825
- For the sake of God, Marty.

39:05.929 --> 39:07.241
- There was
speculation and rumors

39:07.275 --> 39:09.726
that James Gandolfini
actually took you

39:09.761 --> 39:11.452
to the side on the
site of Sopranos

39:11.487 --> 39:15.145
and gave you some words
of wisdom, some advice.

39:15.180 --> 39:16.837
Can you elaborate
on what that was?

39:16.871 --> 39:18.908
- Basically just told me that,
"you have

39:18.942 --> 39:22.221
"something really
good going for yourself,

39:22.256 --> 39:24.120
"being given the
opportunity to be

39:24.154 --> 39:27.261
"in such TV shows and
films, it's a blessing."

39:28.124 --> 39:31.299
And you know, "you
should be really careful

39:31.334 --> 39:32.577
"in the decisions that you make

39:32.611 --> 39:36.270
"and the life that you
live, to not squander this."

39:37.271 --> 39:41.379
And you know, I guess
since back then I

39:41.413 --> 39:43.553
hadn't reached that
moment of clarity, I

39:43.588 --> 39:48.040
kind of brushed off what he
said and I shouldn't have.

39:48.075 --> 39:51.250
But now that I can
look back in hindsight,

39:51.285 --> 39:54.184
wow, that was some
pretty great advice

39:55.531 --> 39:56.670
from a legend.

39:56.704 --> 40:00.536
- I met Lillo when he was
shooting Renaissance Man

40:00.570 --> 40:03.711
with, through Mark Wahlberg
who was a friend of mine.

40:03.746 --> 40:06.611
I met with him and Randy,
who introduced me to him.

40:06.645 --> 40:08.820
- And how did
you guys become tight?

40:10.615 --> 40:11.616
- Me and Lillo were
tight from the beginning.

40:11.650 --> 40:14.722
We just were naturally
very, became friends.

40:14.757 --> 40:18.243
A lot of similar interests
and we just

40:18.277 --> 40:20.452
always find him an
interesting guy to talk to.

40:20.487 --> 40:22.005
It's a very interesting
commentary,

40:22.040 --> 40:23.282
especially about
acting and stuff.

40:23.317 --> 40:25.733
It's interesting,
the first year he

40:25.768 --> 40:27.528
was in prison,
he was just as messed up

40:27.563 --> 40:30.807
as he was before and
I was really angry

40:30.842 --> 40:32.568
at him and we had
a lot of conversations

40:32.602 --> 40:35.571
where I really, really, we had

40:35.605 --> 40:37.607
some tough conversations
where I,

40:37.642 --> 40:39.298
'cuz as much as I'm
his friend, as much

40:39.333 --> 40:41.818
as I want to be there
for him as a friend,

40:41.853 --> 40:44.269
it was, I was very
angry because of

40:44.303 --> 40:46.064
the loss of life.

40:46.098 --> 40:47.306
I knew he didn't shoot the guy.

40:47.341 --> 40:48.963
I knew he was in the wrong place

40:48.998 --> 40:50.862
at the wrong time, but
he's still responsible

40:50.896 --> 40:51.725
for being there.

40:52.933 --> 40:55.073
You know, I always knew,
I was always afraid Lillo

40:55.107 --> 40:56.902
was gonna hurt himself.

40:56.937 --> 40:58.732
I really, I thought
he was gonna die.

40:58.766 --> 41:02.045
I knew he was gonna
die if he didn't stop

41:02.080 --> 41:04.289
and I kept telling him
and that I kept, I did

41:04.323 --> 41:06.636
everything in my
power to convince him

41:06.671 --> 41:09.052
that he's on a road
where he's going

41:09.087 --> 41:11.330
to die, so I always
expected that.

41:11.365 --> 41:13.919
I never expected him
to hurt somebody else.

41:13.954 --> 41:15.507
That was the shocking thing

41:15.542 --> 41:17.613
and of course,
when the truth came out, he

41:17.647 --> 41:18.752
certainly didn't
hurt anyone else.

41:18.786 --> 41:21.099
He was there,
but even being there

41:21.133 --> 41:22.894
was upsetting for
me and it made me, I

41:22.928 --> 41:24.378
was very disappointed in him.

41:26.276 --> 41:27.519
I love the guy,
he's an old friend,

41:27.554 --> 41:29.452
but you know,
someone loses their life.

41:29.487 --> 41:30.280
A police officer.

41:30.315 --> 41:31.972
Just, it's heart breaking

41:32.006 --> 41:33.560
and I was really angry with him

41:34.595 --> 41:36.977
from the first time.

41:37.011 --> 41:39.531
- What was the
reaction from friends

41:39.566 --> 41:43.017
and family that knew
you were close with him,

41:43.052 --> 41:44.536
that's after the
incident happened.

41:44.571 --> 41:45.503
- Most of my friends called me

41:45.537 --> 41:47.539
and said you gotta
get away from this guy.

41:47.574 --> 41:49.679
He's gonna be nothing but
trouble for you.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.649
Some people put a lot of
pressure on me

41:53.683 --> 41:56.444
to get away from,
some of my family

41:56.479 --> 41:57.929
and a lot of other people.

41:57.963 --> 41:59.517
He really was a pariah.

42:01.864 --> 42:05.557
But you know,
the way I look at it, he's

42:05.592 --> 42:07.076
my friend and he
was my friend when he

42:07.110 --> 42:08.595
was a movie star.

42:08.629 --> 42:10.113
He's still gonna be
my friend when he's

42:10.148 --> 42:11.839
in his worst point in his life.

42:11.874 --> 42:12.806
That's what friends are for.

42:12.840 --> 42:14.532
I wouldn't have left him.

42:15.981 --> 42:19.088
As a friend, I would
never leave him.

42:19.122 --> 42:20.710
- Did you lose
friends because of him?

42:20.745 --> 42:22.401
- I did lose some friends
because of him.

42:22.436 --> 42:23.748
- Did you lose family
members because of him?

42:23.782 --> 42:24.887
- Yes.

42:26.198 --> 42:28.097
- How did I meet Lillo?

42:28.131 --> 42:30.099
Just with the Rat Pack
we used to run with

42:30.133 --> 42:31.618
in the city.

42:31.652 --> 42:33.620
Lillo was the hottest
young actor on the scene

42:33.654 --> 42:37.002
right then and running
with our little A-listers,

42:37.037 --> 42:40.696
here comes Lillo out of
nowhere in the Bronx Tale

42:40.730 --> 42:43.215
and just took New York
by storm and

42:45.632 --> 42:47.219
met him down at Scores.

42:48.117 --> 42:51.741
Gentlemen's club
also and one day he

42:51.776 --> 42:53.605
was like, hey, you wanna give me

42:53.640 --> 42:54.537
a ride home?

42:54.572 --> 42:55.262
I said, naw, man,
I've been drinking,

42:55.296 --> 42:57.160
but here goes, "my car keys"

42:57.195 --> 42:59.059
and he took the
car keys and he went

42:59.093 --> 43:01.164
in a brand new 600 Mercedes.

43:01.199 --> 43:03.995
Young 18 year old
kid and we bonded

43:04.029 --> 43:05.065
right after that.

43:05.099 --> 43:07.585
Lillo was two different people.

43:08.655 --> 43:10.484
See, we have a
disease that tells us we

43:10.518 --> 43:12.210
don't have a disease.

43:12.244 --> 43:14.315
So when Lillo
was sober, Lillo was

43:14.350 --> 43:16.421
the best person in the world.

43:16.455 --> 43:19.355
When Lillo was
getting high, then Lillo

43:19.389 --> 43:22.634
was a whole different
person and I

43:22.669 --> 43:25.326
could tell you
stories with, when we'd

43:25.361 --> 43:27.190
be at a hotel room
and have a bunch

43:27.225 --> 43:29.641
of women and you're
partying and Lillo

43:29.676 --> 43:31.539
will start doing drugs
and you could

43:31.574 --> 43:33.783
just see the demon
just taking Lillo on.

43:33.818 --> 43:37.442
Not where he's violent, but
when paranoia would set in.

43:37.476 --> 43:40.548
Between you and I, bro,
I see how sick you are

43:40.583 --> 43:42.412
and sick I was, we gotta
keep each other accountable.

43:42.447 --> 43:44.311
You know?

43:45.553 --> 43:46.693
You know I love you, man.

43:46.727 --> 43:48.453
- I love you, too.

43:48.487 --> 43:51.214
I think also, if I
didn't go out that night,

43:51.249 --> 43:52.699
my life wouldn't have
been saved, you know.

43:52.733 --> 43:54.321
- Right, but you know,

43:55.702 --> 43:58.256
we wouldn't have
cost two lives, you know.

43:58.290 --> 44:00.707
And we gotta look at it where,

44:00.741 --> 44:01.846
and you know we talk about this

44:01.880 --> 44:02.881
all the time,

44:02.916 --> 44:05.884
on the phone and doing
devotionals and stuff.

44:05.919 --> 44:07.955
We know it's not all about us.

44:07.990 --> 44:09.439
We ain't self centered
about it no more.

44:09.474 --> 44:11.234
If we could take this all back

44:11.269 --> 44:13.651
and bring back our victims,
we definitely will.

44:14.479 --> 44:17.309
All we can do right now,
we apologize.

44:17.344 --> 44:21.624
We're sorry and God is not
a God of second chance.

44:21.659 --> 44:23.212
He's a God of another chance

44:23.246 --> 44:25.801
'cuz we've been through
our second chances.

44:25.835 --> 44:27.734
- Right.
- Just hope our family

44:27.768 --> 44:30.633
and their family be
patient with us

44:30.668 --> 44:32.359
and know that we're sick.

44:32.393 --> 44:35.845
Lillo, when Lillo
did cocaine, he

44:35.880 --> 44:37.778
would take a picture
off the wall,

44:37.813 --> 44:41.195
look for a microphone,
look for a camera,

44:41.230 --> 44:42.887
go under the bed, go everywhere,

44:42.921 --> 44:44.751
just like you never seen before.

44:44.785 --> 44:47.339
Just almost like he
was allergic to cocaine

44:47.374 --> 44:52.482
and nobody on the party scene
had it worse than Lillo.

44:52.517 --> 44:55.106
I could tell you this,

44:55.140 --> 44:58.178
we had a photoshoot at
my house for charity

44:58.212 --> 45:00.456
and Lillo,
during the day, sober,

45:01.319 --> 45:02.251
great human being.

45:02.285 --> 45:04.011
A lot of energy, a lot of
compassion.

45:04.046 --> 45:06.531
A lot of empathy
toward the foundation

45:06.565 --> 45:07.739
and toward the people.

45:07.774 --> 45:10.569
People loved him and
then as the night

45:10.604 --> 45:12.744
went on, he started drinking and

45:12.779 --> 45:15.954
the cocaine would
come in, Lillo would

45:15.989 --> 45:18.232
right away, go into
something else.

45:18.267 --> 45:21.270
It was so bad that
I had a large house

45:21.304 --> 45:25.550
right out in this area and I
came home,

45:25.584 --> 45:28.035
maybe three days
after the function,

45:28.070 --> 45:30.520
went into a bedroom downstairs.

45:30.555 --> 45:32.557
We had a big place, 16 bedrooms.

45:32.591 --> 45:34.317
I don't know why
I went down there.

45:34.352 --> 45:36.285
I opened up the
closet to get something.

45:36.319 --> 45:37.458
I don't know why
I was down there.

45:37.493 --> 45:40.392
'Cuz I opened it up and
Lillo was still here.

45:40.427 --> 45:41.946
- How many years sober are you?

45:43.085 --> 45:44.189
- I can probably say that on

45:44.224 --> 45:49.367
this past November 18th,
2017, celebrated 11 years.

45:49.401 --> 45:51.610
- How's that feel?

45:51.645 --> 45:52.819
- It feels tremendous.

45:52.853 --> 45:55.028
I mean, it's not
something I can say

45:55.062 --> 45:57.927
that gets easier
every day, but it

45:57.962 --> 45:59.757
gets more rewarding every day.

46:01.482 --> 46:04.485
While I was away,
one of the best things

46:04.520 --> 46:08.075
that I learned is how
to manage my emotions

46:08.110 --> 46:10.560
and what I learned from
experience

46:10.595 --> 46:14.288
was that no matter how
bad a situation gets,

46:14.323 --> 46:16.049
either your ability
to deal with it

46:17.395 --> 46:18.189
will get better
or the situation itself

46:18.223 --> 46:19.052
will get better.

46:20.536 --> 46:24.367
And then I came to a realization
that I don't need drugs.

46:24.402 --> 46:27.370
That God has equipped
me with what's necessary

46:27.405 --> 46:29.925
to overcome pretty much anything

46:29.959 --> 46:32.065
and that is one
of the biggest tools

46:32.099 --> 46:37.035
that I use to keep
sober until this day.

46:37.070 --> 46:38.347
- Before I bet Lillo,

46:40.004 --> 46:42.489
an actor by the
name of Phil Barbarino

46:42.523 --> 46:46.044
had the part of C
and I was going

46:46.079 --> 46:49.772
in for Mario and then
Jill Greenburg told us

46:49.807 --> 46:54.294
unofficially that
it was, Phil was

46:54.328 --> 46:57.159
gonna play C and I was
gonna play Crazy Mario

46:57.193 --> 46:59.471
and I think she said,
I think Joey had

46:59.506 --> 47:01.680
the part maybe even before us.

47:04.131 --> 47:07.203
Joey from Goodfellas, so
Joey was gonna play Slick.

47:07.238 --> 47:08.826
And she told us this
unofficially

47:08.860 --> 47:10.897
that we were those characters.

47:10.931 --> 47:13.865
- Now, how did
you guys feel knowing

47:13.900 --> 47:15.971
that this guy just
came out of nowhere.

47:16.005 --> 47:20.044
- Well at first, we,
I was on Phil's side.

47:20.078 --> 47:21.700
At first, so I
was like, this kid.

47:21.735 --> 47:24.427
Don't worry, Phil, I said, he
doesn't have

47:24.462 --> 47:27.085
a shot, but I
knew he had a shot.

47:27.120 --> 47:28.328
- Right.
- And then when I saw

47:28.362 --> 47:31.434
him act, I thought
he was fantastic.

47:31.469 --> 47:32.470
I thought he was fantastic

47:32.504 --> 47:34.610
and I believed that
he was from the Bronx

47:34.644 --> 47:36.129
and he had that Bronx accent.

47:36.163 --> 47:37.371
I don't know if Lillo put it on

47:37.406 --> 47:41.030
or if he just, maybe it's a
Yonkers accent

47:41.065 --> 47:43.101
that was close to the Bronx,

47:43.136 --> 47:46.587
but he also spoke,
he also speaks Italian

47:46.622 --> 47:48.382
and Spanish and stuff like that,

47:49.280 --> 47:51.765
so he was able to do the
Bronx accent perfect.

47:51.799 --> 47:53.111
I'm from the Bronx
- Right.

47:53.146 --> 47:54.941
- So, I know a Bronx
accent when I hear it.

47:54.975 --> 47:55.803
He had it.

47:55.838 --> 47:58.220
After Bronx Tale
we actually did,

47:58.254 --> 47:59.600
we worked again together.

48:03.190 --> 48:04.916
We knew each
other's families, also,

48:04.951 --> 48:06.331
from being on set,
so I knew his mom

48:06.366 --> 48:09.196
and dad and he knew my
mom and dad, my brothers.

48:09.231 --> 48:12.337
And Lillo has
amazing memory, too,

48:12.372 --> 48:14.615
'cuz he saw me
years later and asked

48:14.650 --> 48:18.171
my family by name,
which was impressive.

48:18.205 --> 48:22.382
But after Bronx Tale,
we had done,

48:22.416 --> 48:25.143
we had done a
show called Falcone

48:25.178 --> 48:30.217
about, it was a spin
off of Danny Brasco

48:30.252 --> 48:32.150
and it was James Russo.

48:33.669 --> 48:35.947
Titus Welliver was in it.

48:35.982 --> 48:40.400
It was a, Bobby Moresco,
I think, directed it.

48:40.434 --> 48:43.506
Anyway, it was gonna
be a big series

48:43.541 --> 48:44.818
and I was playing Nicky,
the kid.

48:44.852 --> 48:47.269
He was playing one
of the wise guys.

48:47.303 --> 48:49.996
And he was a regular in it.

48:50.030 --> 48:51.963
I was gonna be, I think, a
recurring.

48:51.998 --> 48:53.965
Something like that,
but he was a regular.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.278
And then they killed him off

48:56.312 --> 48:57.900
and I was surprised that
they killed him off.

48:57.935 --> 48:58.970
I don't know the real story, you

48:59.005 --> 49:00.213
can ask Lillo about it.

49:00.247 --> 49:02.318
But I remember him coming, if we

49:02.353 --> 49:06.012
had a six or seven
o'clock a.m. call time,

49:06.046 --> 49:09.670
he'd come in wired
from the night before,

49:09.705 --> 49:12.915
not sleeping, he had
the black under his eyes

49:12.950 --> 49:17.023
and I knew he was out
from the night before.

49:17.057 --> 49:19.508
He looked terrible and that's
when I knew

49:19.542 --> 49:22.614
and then we met out
a couple of times.

49:22.649 --> 49:24.962
We didn't go out
together, but I'd

49:24.996 --> 49:27.136
go to a club or an
opening for something

49:27.171 --> 49:29.863
or an event and he'd be there

49:29.897 --> 49:32.417
and he was with these kids.

49:32.452 --> 49:35.662
I forgot their names,
they're just weirdos.

49:35.696 --> 49:37.733
I mean, this kid Rob
used to wear

49:37.767 --> 49:40.667
these contact lenses
that were just so weird.

49:40.701 --> 49:42.565
Terrible piece on his head.

49:42.600 --> 49:44.326
They were just all around him.

49:44.360 --> 49:48.986
They were obviously
enabling him.

49:49.020 --> 49:50.780
His family were
builders in Yonkers.

49:50.815 --> 49:51.850
They had a lot of money and they

49:51.885 --> 49:53.197
did very, very well.

49:53.231 --> 49:55.371
His father worked
like, I've never seen

49:55.406 --> 49:57.615
anybody work
like his father, like a bull,

49:57.649 --> 49:58.892
until he had the heart problem,

49:58.926 --> 50:00.583
but his father was a great guy.

50:00.618 --> 50:02.240
Worked really, really hard.

50:02.275 --> 50:04.035
I remember Lillo
always looked great.

50:04.070 --> 50:05.347
He always drove cool cars

50:05.381 --> 50:06.589
and stuff like
that and then I saw him

50:06.624 --> 50:11.629
in the club once, he had
a hole in his sweater.

50:13.286 --> 50:15.529
He had mangled shoes on

50:15.564 --> 50:18.774
and he asked me for $20
or something like that

50:18.808 --> 50:19.809
and I said, you're asking me.

50:19.844 --> 50:22.053
I should be asking you.

50:23.641 --> 50:25.643
- Hugs and smiles during the
homecoming this afternoon.

50:25.677 --> 50:27.507
Three and a half
hours after his release

50:27.541 --> 50:29.336
from an upstate
prison this morning,

50:29.371 --> 50:32.063
former actor Lillo
Brancato arrived in Yonkers

50:32.098 --> 50:32.891
a free man.

50:32.926 --> 50:34.307
- It's a very big day.

50:34.341 --> 50:35.929
Thank you all for coming.

50:35.963 --> 50:38.483
I just wanna spend some
time with my family.

50:38.518 --> 50:40.002
- When you turn this corner,

50:40.037 --> 50:42.591
what goes on in your mind.

50:42.625 --> 50:44.075
- A lot of memories, you know.

50:44.110 --> 50:44.938
I grew up here.

50:44.972 --> 50:45.870
A lot of good memories

50:47.009 --> 50:49.253
that all become the bad
memories.

50:49.287 --> 50:51.255
A lot of guys that I knew

50:51.289 --> 50:53.636
from this
neighborhood died, drugs.

50:54.465 --> 50:56.225
Guys I was really,
really close to.

50:59.125 --> 51:00.643
I remembering taking
care of my friend, Jimmy.

51:00.678 --> 51:02.059
They used to call him Aruba.

51:03.853 --> 51:06.097
He passed away in 2009

51:07.029 --> 51:08.686
and he used to smoke crack

51:10.067 --> 51:11.723
and I did also, but I wasn't,
you know,

51:11.758 --> 51:13.277
doing it every day.

51:13.311 --> 51:15.072
He told me, he said,
"Li, you know what.

51:15.106 --> 51:17.039
"You keep messing
with that crack pipe,

51:17.074 --> 51:18.834
"one day it's gonna get you."

51:18.868 --> 51:20.801
I remember the
day that it got me.

51:20.836 --> 51:22.769
It was in this very, very,

51:24.184 --> 51:26.290
this very parking
space right here,

51:26.324 --> 51:27.705
this parkin' spot.

51:27.739 --> 51:29.086
I was walking into the store

51:29.120 --> 51:30.915
to get cigarettes
and this guys parked

51:30.949 --> 51:33.124
in this car and
was speaking loud,

51:33.159 --> 51:34.298
that they wanted me to hear it.

51:34.332 --> 51:36.127
They guy said,
the guys said, he goes,

51:36.162 --> 51:37.473
"oh, Lillo's a good guy.

51:37.508 --> 51:39.579
"He never forgot
where he came from."

51:39.613 --> 51:41.477
So automatically, I'm curious.

51:41.512 --> 51:43.445
I didn't, I've seen him around.

51:43.479 --> 51:45.585
I knew who they were,
so I walked over

51:45.619 --> 51:49.140
to the car and I remember
I looked in the car.

51:49.175 --> 51:51.073
I said, hey guys, how you doin'.

51:51.108 --> 51:54.111
The guy's lookin' at me,
said, "yeah, I'm alright."

51:54.145 --> 51:58.011
And sitting down,
pulls out a crack pipe

51:58.045 --> 51:59.323
and he looks at me.

51:59.357 --> 52:01.221
He didn't raise it up so high

52:01.256 --> 52:02.843
so we could see it from outside.

52:02.878 --> 52:05.674
It was down here and he said,
he said, "you interested?"

52:06.675 --> 52:08.780
and I knew what
that was gonna be.

52:08.815 --> 52:10.403
Once I take that
first hit of crack, I

52:10.437 --> 52:13.095
could be out for
two days, a week.

52:13.130 --> 52:16.995
And I said, yeah,
yeah, I'm interested.

52:17.030 --> 52:19.136
I got in the back
seat of the car.

52:19.170 --> 52:21.897
I remember we took
a ride up this street

52:21.931 --> 52:24.071
and we came around
and the crack pipe

52:24.106 --> 52:26.039
was full of resin,
- Right.

52:26.073 --> 52:27.282
- So I said to the guys,
I said, no, no, no.

52:27.316 --> 52:29.594
He was ready to
put a rock in there.

52:29.629 --> 52:30.871
And I said, no, no, no,
it's fine.

52:30.906 --> 52:32.632
I'll just, he goes no, no, no.

52:32.666 --> 52:33.771
He said, "if you're
gonna do it, you do

52:33.805 --> 52:35.462
"it the right way."

52:35.497 --> 52:39.432
I remember he put a $20
rock inside the pipe

52:39.466 --> 52:44.471
and I remember when
I took that hit,

52:45.127 --> 52:46.473
that was it.

52:46.508 --> 52:47.336
That was it.

52:49.476 --> 52:52.617
From that day in July of 2005

52:52.652 --> 52:56.103
until the day I got arrested,
December 10th, 2005,

52:56.138 --> 52:58.209
I did not miss one day.

52:58.244 --> 52:59.831
I smoked crack every single day

53:00.694 --> 53:03.904
and that crack pipe
got a real hold on me

53:03.939 --> 53:06.390
to the point where I
used to be in my room,

53:06.424 --> 53:09.772
look at the mirror and I
was a shadow of myself.

53:09.807 --> 53:11.809
I was about 135 pounds.

53:11.843 --> 53:13.086
I looked like a skeleton

53:14.121 --> 53:16.745
and I would literally like,
so powerless,

53:16.779 --> 53:19.092
and I used to look
in the mirror crying.

53:19.126 --> 53:22.544
Please God, please help
me, help me please.

53:22.578 --> 53:23.959
- So when you
see this neighborhood,

53:23.993 --> 53:26.064
does it bring back more bad

53:26.099 --> 53:26.927
or more good memories?

53:29.309 --> 53:30.310
- I would say more bad memories,

53:30.345 --> 53:32.726
but now that I have reached

53:32.761 --> 53:35.695
the moment of clarity,
I kinda deal

53:35.729 --> 53:37.075
with it a little bit better

53:38.076 --> 53:39.457
and just am so thankful that

53:41.390 --> 53:43.703
that I did make it
out and that I am

53:43.737 --> 53:45.498
safe and sound and I am a,

53:46.430 --> 53:49.260
that I am in a
better place in life.

53:49.295 --> 53:50.917
And thank God for that.

53:50.951 --> 53:52.194
- Right.
- Because without Him,

53:52.229 --> 53:53.299
none of that would
have been possible.

53:53.333 --> 53:56.267
- The iconic, the
working man is a sucker.

53:56.302 --> 53:58.407
What are your thoughts on that?

54:00.064 --> 54:03.240
- Well, my old thoughts,

54:04.448 --> 54:05.690
I would probably have to say

54:05.725 --> 54:08.245
that I believe
the exact opposite.

54:08.279 --> 54:10.005
That the working
man is not a sucker.

54:10.039 --> 54:13.664
My father's a Mason, a builder

54:13.698 --> 54:15.597
and worked really, really hard

54:15.631 --> 54:16.770
and I can tell you this.

54:16.805 --> 54:18.393
He's far from a sucker.

54:19.980 --> 54:21.637
- Well, my relationship
with Lillo

54:21.672 --> 54:23.294
was like my relationship
with a lot

54:23.329 --> 54:26.297
of young studs coming
up in New York.

54:26.332 --> 54:28.334
Gettin' in the movie game and

54:28.368 --> 54:30.853
the early '90s to
mid '90s when I

54:30.888 --> 54:32.303
was running an big
gossip column in

54:32.338 --> 54:35.133
the New York Daily News,
I was in contact

54:35.168 --> 54:36.825
with all those guys,
all the young bucks,

54:36.859 --> 54:40.656
and you know, I remember
the movie premier

54:40.691 --> 54:43.038
specifically for Bronx Tale,

54:43.072 --> 54:44.246
because it was a big to-do.

54:44.281 --> 54:46.110
It was in Tribeca.

54:46.144 --> 54:48.423
Bob De Niro directing.

54:48.457 --> 54:49.320
I remember there was a big thing

54:49.355 --> 54:51.874
with, a lot of people
couldn't get in

54:51.909 --> 54:53.876
and you know, Lillo was about to

54:53.911 --> 54:55.947
be crowned as this
new actor that

54:55.982 --> 54:58.985
was gonna make some
noise for a long time.

54:59.019 --> 55:02.506
And frankly, you left that
screening

55:02.540 --> 55:06.199
or the premier saying
this kid fucking held

55:06.233 --> 55:09.513
his own with Bob De Niro
and Chazz Palminteri,

55:09.547 --> 55:13.517
heavyweights, he's
gonna be around forever.

55:13.551 --> 55:15.242
Lillo didn't make me an enemy.

55:15.277 --> 55:17.555
I never sought, I never
went after him.

55:17.590 --> 55:20.627
'Cuz you gotta understand,
as an Italian guy,

55:20.662 --> 55:22.457
there's a certain amount of
movies,

55:22.491 --> 55:23.906
a certain amount of
movie us Italians see

55:23.941 --> 55:25.632
that come on TV and
you put the remote

55:25.667 --> 55:26.909
and you can throw
the remote away.

55:26.944 --> 55:28.911
When you turn on Rocky or
Godfather

55:28.946 --> 55:31.604
or Goodfellas or Raging Bull

55:31.638 --> 55:34.814
or Bronx Tale, Casino even,
you're done

55:34.848 --> 55:36.263
for the next two hours.

55:36.298 --> 55:37.368
And when you're one of the stars

55:37.403 --> 55:39.957
in those movies, you're
like royalty to us.

55:39.991 --> 55:42.269
So, I would never
go out of my way

55:42.304 --> 55:44.064
to write something
bad about Lillo,

55:44.099 --> 55:47.102
but it was getting
increasingly harder not to

55:47.136 --> 55:49.518
because there were
altercations and fights

55:49.553 --> 55:53.384
and arguments
that warranted attention

55:53.419 --> 55:54.385
in the columns.

55:54.420 --> 55:56.283
There was a club
uptown called Rouge

55:56.318 --> 55:58.631
that a lot of the
monsters stayed at

55:58.665 --> 55:59.597
and big time guys.

55:59.632 --> 56:01.392
Genovese guys, Gambino guys.

56:01.427 --> 56:03.567
They all converged there.

56:03.601 --> 56:05.879
These are fuckin' killers.

56:05.914 --> 56:07.329
They don't take shit.

56:07.364 --> 56:08.779
Polito would have
worked in there

56:08.813 --> 56:10.367
with the same attitude like he

56:10.401 --> 56:12.990
was running his own
show and those guys

56:13.024 --> 56:14.543
wouldn't have it.

56:14.578 --> 56:17.408
And again, he's treated
a certain way

56:17.443 --> 56:18.858
because he's from a
certain movie

56:18.892 --> 56:22.758
with a certain actor and
they put kid gloves on,

56:22.793 --> 56:24.415
but there came a time
when he wasn't allowed

56:24.450 --> 56:26.728
back in that club and
that's a big blow

56:26.762 --> 56:28.419
to a kid like that.

56:28.454 --> 56:30.283
I think he has a shot
to break in again

56:30.317 --> 56:32.250
because he had some
talent and I'm sure he

56:32.285 --> 56:33.424
still has some talent.

56:34.287 --> 56:36.462
Up until recently,
everybody in this town

56:36.496 --> 56:37.359
got a second chance.

56:37.394 --> 56:38.774
I don't care if your
were Mel Gibson

56:38.809 --> 56:41.294
and started a race
war on the PCH

56:41.328 --> 56:43.883
or Woody Allen who married
his adopted daughter.

56:43.917 --> 56:46.264
I mean, you get second
chances in this town,

56:46.299 --> 56:47.714
in this business.

56:47.749 --> 56:49.613
Right now, the climate in
Hollywood is,

56:49.647 --> 56:52.616
anything you did bad
as a man, you're done.

56:52.650 --> 56:54.618
What Lillo did didn't
have anything

56:54.652 --> 56:57.793
of a sexual nature to
it, so if it's simply

56:57.828 --> 56:59.554
a matter of breaking the law,

56:59.588 --> 57:02.004
it's a tough spot, but
I think he certainly

57:02.039 --> 57:03.350
has the ability to come back

57:03.385 --> 57:04.421
if he wants to.

57:04.455 --> 57:06.664
That's why that movie
resounded in all of us,

57:06.699 --> 57:10.427
because I've lived a life
where sometimes you're

57:10.461 --> 57:13.119
not using the talent that God
bestowed you

57:13.153 --> 57:14.465
and when you're not using it,

57:14.500 --> 57:15.915
things go bad in life and you

57:15.949 --> 57:17.951
can really expect to find
yourself on your ass.

57:17.986 --> 57:20.022
When you accept that
you have this talent

57:20.057 --> 57:21.438
that God gave you,
you make your living

57:21.472 --> 57:23.509
with it, it's truly the gift
that God

57:23.543 --> 57:25.545
gave you, good things
are gonna happen.

57:25.580 --> 57:28.479
I think Lillo has a gift
and got a gift from God.

57:28.514 --> 57:30.585
He fucked his life up,

57:30.619 --> 57:31.551
but I don't think
that gift left him

57:31.586 --> 57:33.450
and I think there's
somebody out there

57:33.484 --> 57:34.278
that's gonna put their hands out

57:34.312 --> 57:36.142
and allow him back
into the scene.

57:36.176 --> 57:37.764
- When you start working in film

57:38.662 --> 57:40.180
and TV business
and make a little

57:40.215 --> 57:42.424
bit if of money,
you know for me, I

57:42.459 --> 57:43.736
lived at home with my parents.

57:43.770 --> 57:44.771
Went to boarding school.

57:44.806 --> 57:47.981
I was very, lived in a
sort of insulated bubble

57:49.327 --> 57:51.778
and never really had
to worry too much

57:51.813 --> 57:53.262
about money, never had to worry

57:53.297 --> 57:54.678
about buying stuff,
so I never had

57:54.712 --> 57:55.782
a lot of cash on me.

57:55.817 --> 57:58.578
Never had a bank account
or anything like that.

57:58.613 --> 58:01.685
When I started working
a lot in New York City,

58:01.719 --> 58:03.997
it's not just having, being
recognizable

58:04.032 --> 58:07.449
or being the new hot guy
or whatever they call it,

58:07.484 --> 58:08.864
but it's all the sudden having,

58:08.899 --> 58:13.835
being 18 or 19 and having
$150,000 cash

58:13.869 --> 58:15.319
in your bank account.

58:16.562 --> 58:18.046
- Right, could
have been at that point,

58:18.080 --> 58:20.013
that's like 10 million
at that age.

58:20.048 --> 58:22.602
- Right and you're
working on jobs

58:22.637 --> 58:24.742
and you're making
50 here, 75, 100

58:24.777 --> 58:28.712
and it's just growing in your
bank account

58:28.746 --> 58:30.921
and really, you know,
when you have

58:30.955 --> 58:32.060
that kind of cash and never had

58:32.094 --> 58:34.994
that kind of cash
before, I just didn't see

58:35.028 --> 58:37.030
there was no limit
to what I could do.

58:39.930 --> 58:43.554
So, that and sort of the access,

58:43.589 --> 58:45.832
really it's the money
that creates the access

58:47.075 --> 58:48.525
and so, the drugs, you know,

58:48.559 --> 58:51.804
all that stuff becomes
very available

58:51.838 --> 58:54.013
because you're
supplying the drugs

58:54.047 --> 58:56.912
and the alcohol for
a lot of the friends.

58:56.947 --> 58:59.087
So, they'll be finding
stuff for you

58:59.121 --> 59:00.295
'cuz you're footing the bill,

59:00.329 --> 59:02.366
- Right.
- And it's,

59:02.400 --> 59:04.437
it's constant and never ending.

59:04.471 --> 59:06.750
- So, I would be
remiss if I didn't ask

59:06.784 --> 59:08.303
the question that's probably
the most important question

59:08.337 --> 59:09.649
in this whole documentary.

59:10.719 --> 59:12.928
Do you feel like you
got away with murder?

59:14.309 --> 59:17.312
- Well, I've always
taken full responsibility

59:17.346 --> 59:21.074
for how my addiction
and my, you know,

59:22.351 --> 59:24.595
decision making made a
contribution

59:24.630 --> 59:27.080
in the death of the heroic
police officer.

59:29.082 --> 59:30.359
But with that being said,

59:32.189 --> 59:35.433
I don't feel that I was
directly responsible

59:35.468 --> 59:38.782
for the death, so
therefore, no, I don't think

59:38.816 --> 59:41.094
I was, or got away with murder.

59:42.095 --> 59:42.889
- What were your
initial thoughts

59:42.924 --> 59:44.684
when you first heard about

59:44.719 --> 59:46.824
the whole incident?

59:46.859 --> 59:49.068
- Before we even
knew who it was,

59:49.102 --> 59:52.174
it was another cop murder.

59:53.037 --> 59:54.694
- Were you working
the night of or no?

59:54.729 --> 59:57.283
- I was off that night actually.

59:57.317 --> 59:59.078
- Okay.
- But a few weeks

59:59.112 --> 01:00:01.321
or months prior, another
officer was killed.

01:00:02.909 --> 01:00:04.255
I think it was Officer Dylan
Stewart.

01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:07.017
So, yeah, immediately,
just the initial reports

01:00:07.051 --> 01:00:08.535
that another officer killed.

01:00:09.951 --> 01:00:12.125
I mean, any officer killed
struck us,

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.713
but two almost back to back,

01:00:14.852 --> 01:00:16.682
and then when we
heard who it was,

01:00:18.684 --> 01:00:21.963
someone kind of
privileged who probably

01:00:21.997 --> 01:00:23.620
had a lot goin' for him,

01:00:23.654 --> 01:00:26.001
that struck an even deeper nerve

01:00:26.036 --> 01:00:28.072
in pretty much all of us.

01:00:28.107 --> 01:00:30.627
- What was the,
if you can remember,

01:00:30.661 --> 01:00:31.766
what was the
initial reaction around

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.251
the precinct when,
you know, around

01:00:34.285 --> 01:00:36.633
the funeral time or
right after it happened?

01:00:38.289 --> 01:00:43.294
- Everyone in
general was mad, livid.

01:00:46.504 --> 01:00:47.782
Not just because of what
happened,

01:00:47.816 --> 01:00:49.715
but again, because of who it was

01:00:49.749 --> 01:00:50.957
and that he was, what we view,

01:00:50.992 --> 01:00:52.269
as a privileged person.

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:54.685
How could this have happened?

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.169
How could he been involved

01:00:56.204 --> 01:00:58.068
and then kind of also a feeling

01:00:58.102 --> 01:01:00.829
of like, almost being
backstabbed

01:01:00.864 --> 01:01:02.797
because, I think, in general,

01:01:02.831 --> 01:01:05.869
a lot of us liked Lillo from
Bronx Tale.

01:01:05.903 --> 01:01:06.697
- Right.
- So, we liked the movie.

01:01:06.732 --> 01:01:07.560
We liked him.

01:01:07.594 --> 01:01:09.148
I talked to a few today,
actually,

01:01:09.182 --> 01:01:10.908
about this and --

01:01:10.943 --> 01:01:12.185
- What were their
thoughts?

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:14.256
- Like it was yesterday.

01:01:14.291 --> 01:01:15.223
He was a scumbag.

01:01:15.257 --> 01:01:16.051
He's a perp.

01:01:16.086 --> 01:01:17.259
He's a piece of shit.

01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:20.504
You know, he should
still be in jail.

01:01:20.538 --> 01:01:21.712
He should have
gotten the death penalty.

01:01:21.747 --> 01:01:23.541
So on and so forth.
- Right.

01:01:25.336 --> 01:01:27.476
- I've yet to find anyone in
NYPD

01:01:27.511 --> 01:01:31.101
who has anything
positive to say about it.

01:01:31.135 --> 01:01:31.998
- Do you think he
deserves a second chance,

01:01:32.033 --> 01:01:33.310
if not why?

01:01:35.726 --> 01:01:37.728
- I don't and I don't
because, I do believe

01:01:37.763 --> 01:01:39.523
in second chances, but for me,

01:01:39.557 --> 01:01:44.562
this was too egregious
to deserve

01:01:44.873 --> 01:01:46.012
a second chance

01:01:47.289 --> 01:01:50.465
and from interviews
I saw with people

01:01:50.499 --> 01:01:53.571
who used to work with him,
Chazz Palminteri, I think.

01:01:53.606 --> 01:01:54.780
I think I've seen
a few interviews

01:01:54.814 --> 01:01:57.023
with him back then,
he said that he

01:01:57.058 --> 01:01:59.232
had heard he'd been
involved in drug activity

01:01:59.267 --> 01:02:01.510
and so on and he
tried to steer him clear

01:02:01.545 --> 01:02:04.203
and he told him this is
gonna lead to trouble.

01:02:04.237 --> 01:02:05.756
So, it sounded like there
were probably people

01:02:05.791 --> 01:02:07.931
around him who
tried to steer him clear

01:02:07.965 --> 01:02:11.037
from that bad
element he was getting into

01:02:11.072 --> 01:02:13.143
and he didn't listen.

01:02:13.177 --> 01:02:15.386
This, things like this happen

01:02:15.421 --> 01:02:16.767
when you're
involved in that activity

01:02:16.802 --> 01:02:20.460
and to me, this is
something that's not worthy

01:02:20.495 --> 01:02:22.152
of a second chance.

01:02:22.186 --> 01:02:23.705
- Why did you think
it was important

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:28.296
to do this documentary from
a cop's side of things?

01:02:29.366 --> 01:02:31.230
- I figured the public
just needs to know

01:02:31.264 --> 01:02:33.266
how the cops feel.

01:02:33.301 --> 01:02:35.924
In particular NYPD cops.

01:02:35.959 --> 01:02:38.547
That the feeling hasn't changed.

01:02:40.411 --> 01:02:42.241
I hate to use the word
hate, but I'm gonna use

01:02:42.275 --> 01:02:43.069
the word hate.

01:02:43.104 --> 01:02:44.830
Everyone that I
know at NYPD that

01:02:44.864 --> 01:02:48.212
had mentioned Bracato's
name, they hate him.

01:02:48.247 --> 01:02:49.593
Still consider him a scumbag.

01:02:49.627 --> 01:02:51.215
Piece of shit, worthless.

01:02:53.148 --> 01:02:56.634
And wouldn't see
any movie or a project

01:02:56.669 --> 01:02:59.845
with him in it and I felt

01:02:59.879 --> 01:03:02.537
it was just important
to make that known.

01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:04.435
- Well, you know,

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:06.265
this is Saint Ann's Church.

01:03:06.299 --> 01:03:08.060
This is where I
did my first communion

01:03:08.094 --> 01:03:09.578
back in 1984.

01:03:10.476 --> 01:03:13.755
It's where I did my
confirmation in 1990.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:14.998
I don't live too far from here.

01:03:15.032 --> 01:03:17.103
Maybe like two
minutes down the street.

01:03:18.415 --> 01:03:20.417
And you know,
this church has a lot

01:03:20.451 --> 01:03:21.383
of meaning to me.

01:03:21.418 --> 01:03:23.351
I mean, it's like
part of my childhood.

01:03:23.385 --> 01:03:25.456
It's part of who I am.

01:03:25.491 --> 01:03:26.457
And you know,

01:03:28.114 --> 01:03:30.807
and really, only
after I was incarcerated

01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:33.637
did I really realize the
importance

01:03:33.671 --> 01:03:36.398
of having God in
your life, you know,

01:03:36.433 --> 01:03:38.607
because of the bad mistakes and

01:03:38.642 --> 01:03:40.886
the choices that
I made in my life

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:42.819
and what they resulted in.

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:45.856
A lot of people left my side.

01:03:45.891 --> 01:03:47.547
A lot of people that
were near and dear to me.

01:03:47.582 --> 01:03:48.721
People that I loved.

01:03:49.687 --> 01:03:50.999
They just weren't there for me.

01:03:51.034 --> 01:03:51.897
Not everyone.

01:03:55.555 --> 01:03:57.764
But one person
who never left my side

01:03:57.799 --> 01:04:00.319
was God, He was always there

01:04:01.182 --> 01:04:06.187
and I now know
because of what I went

01:04:06.601 --> 01:04:09.949
through and the
changes in my life

01:04:09.984 --> 01:04:13.884
of who I was and
then who I became

01:04:13.919 --> 01:04:16.162
the day that I was released.

01:04:16.197 --> 01:04:18.785
Funny how life works itself out

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:23.825
because, you know, 25
years later at least,

01:04:24.101 --> 01:04:25.654
right next door to this church,

01:04:25.689 --> 01:04:26.932
which is part of this church,

01:04:26.966 --> 01:04:29.141
is where they have
parties and stuff,

01:04:29.175 --> 01:04:32.385
is where I attend Narcotics
Anonymous meetings.

01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.628
God does exist.

01:04:35.319 --> 01:04:38.253
This is why I try
to go to church

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:43.189
as much as possible and
I thank God every day.

01:04:43.224 --> 01:04:46.192
Every day of my life before
I do anything, I pray

01:04:46.227 --> 01:04:49.126
for at least 10
minutes to thank Him

01:04:49.161 --> 01:04:53.234
for giving me the
strength to become

01:04:53.268 --> 01:04:54.960
the person that I am today.

01:04:54.994 --> 01:04:59.205
You know, it's,
I owe it all to Him.

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.207
So, here I am.

01:05:06.626 --> 01:05:08.145
- I feel as though
he got the right amount

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:11.769
of time just because
he did do a robbery.

01:05:11.804 --> 01:05:13.357
There was a weapon involved

01:05:13.392 --> 01:05:16.671
and knowing the laws and
actually having

01:05:16.705 --> 01:05:18.500
an ex-boyfriend
who went to jail for

01:05:18.535 --> 01:05:19.985
the same thing,
that's what he got.

01:05:20.019 --> 01:05:23.057
He got 10 years and
did 85% of his time

01:05:23.091 --> 01:05:24.817
and I feel as though
that was fair.

01:05:24.851 --> 01:05:26.715
- It's so easy to get bored

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:29.132
and so then, the next
thing is, what's next.

01:05:29.166 --> 01:05:30.271
I've got everything.

01:05:30.305 --> 01:05:33.308
Like, what else is there?

01:05:33.343 --> 01:05:38.141
And so, drugs and
alcohol and whatever

01:05:38.175 --> 01:05:40.005
comes into the
picture inevitably,

01:05:40.039 --> 01:05:44.492
and it almost always,
it's so hard

01:05:44.526 --> 01:05:47.598
to navigate yourself through
that world.

01:05:47.633 --> 01:05:50.118
- I think that Lillo
is a great artist

01:05:50.153 --> 01:05:54.019
and wanted to keep
working and you know,

01:05:54.053 --> 01:05:55.468
at the end of the day,

01:05:58.471 --> 01:06:01.371
I think it does,
it does put a bit

01:06:01.405 --> 01:06:05.409
of a shadow over
all the amazing work

01:06:05.444 --> 01:06:06.307
that he has done.

01:06:12.761 --> 01:06:14.246
- Somebody's
watching this documentary

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.178
who didn't know Lillo
or don't know him

01:06:16.075 --> 01:06:17.766
obviously personally
or don't know much

01:06:17.801 --> 01:06:19.216
about him, what would you like

01:06:19.251 --> 01:06:21.460
them to know about him that
maybe somebody

01:06:21.494 --> 01:06:22.323
wouldn't know?

01:06:23.772 --> 01:06:25.982
- That's he's a
different person.

01:06:26.016 --> 01:06:28.467
He's dedicated to his, you know,

01:06:29.571 --> 01:06:31.228
to his job and his career

01:06:31.263 --> 01:06:34.369
and he's a good kid.

01:06:34.404 --> 01:06:35.198
He's a really good kid.

01:06:35.232 --> 01:06:37.441
He got great heart, you know.

01:06:37.476 --> 01:06:38.753
What he's did,
whatever happened to him,

01:06:38.787 --> 01:06:41.652
it was just, it was from
the drugs, nothing else.

01:06:45.691 --> 01:06:48.694
- Thank you.
- Thank you, thank you.
