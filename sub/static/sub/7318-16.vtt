WEBVTT

00:12.633 --> 00:13.800
(light buzzes)

00:13.833 --> 00:14.900
(monitor beeping)

00:14.933 --> 00:17.467
(Meredith) IT'S A LOOK
PATIENTS GET IN THEIR EYES.

00:17.500 --> 00:21.400
THERE'S A SCENT,
THE SMELL OF DEATH,

00:21.433 --> 00:24.067
SOME KIND OF SIXTH SENSE.

00:24.100 --> 00:27.367
WHEN THE GREAT BEYOND
IS HEADING FOR YOU,

00:27.400 --> 00:28.733
YOU FEEL IT COMING.

00:28.767 --> 00:31.733
(monitor emits continuous tone)

00:31.767 --> 00:33.267
WHAT'S THE ONE THING

00:33.300 --> 00:36.467
YOU'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF DOING
BEFORE YOU DIE?

00:36.500 --> 00:39.500
***

01:07.533 --> 01:09.433
OKAY, HELLO?

01:09.467 --> 01:11.567
CLEARLY NOT MY DREAM.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.600
***

01:16.800 --> 01:18.533
GEORGE.

01:20.867 --> 01:23.100
YOU'RE THE STRONGEST,
MOST MASCULINE MAN

01:23.133 --> 01:24.600
I HAVE EVER KNOWN.

01:24.633 --> 01:26.467
***

01:26.500 --> 01:27.800
YOU'RE SMARTER THAN ME,

01:27.833 --> 01:30.533
AND YOU'VE GOT
REALLY GREAT HAIR.

01:30.567 --> 01:32.533
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU,
GEORGE.

01:32.567 --> 01:35.200
***

01:35.233 --> 01:38.833
I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN,
AND I ALWAYS WILL BE.

01:38.867 --> 01:42.600
***

01:49.067 --> 01:51.633
SEE... I TOLD YOU.
NOT MY DREAM.

01:51.667 --> 01:53.767
AH-CHOO!

01:53.800 --> 01:55.300
OKAY... (sniffles)

01:55.333 --> 01:57.233
THIS IS THE LAST TIME
I'M GONNA TELL YOU THIS.

01:57.267 --> 01:59.167
IF YOU'RE GONNA
CLOG UP THE TOILET,

01:59.200 --> 02:01.100
YOU HAVE GOTTA BE WILLING
TO USE A PLUNGER.

02:01.133 --> 02:03.533
OTHERWISE, WE'RE GONNA
MAKE YOU CRAP IN THE BACKYARD.

02:03.567 --> 02:05.233
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ON THE FLOOR?

02:05.267 --> 02:07.100
GET UP. SOMETHING'S WRONG
WITH MEREDITH.

02:07.133 --> 02:09.233
I'M JUST NOT GOING.

02:09.267 --> 02:11.167
YOU HAVE TO GO TO WORK.
YOU'RE AN INTERN.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.733
SAVING LIVES
IS NOT OPTIONAL.

02:12.767 --> 02:15.100
YES, IT IS.
I'M STAYING HOME.

02:15.133 --> 02:17.433
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE HELPING.

02:17.467 --> 02:20.200
UH... MERE.

02:20.233 --> 02:22.133
MAYBE, UM, THERE'LL BE
A HORRIBLE ACCIDENT

02:22.167 --> 02:23.500
NEARBY THE HOSPITAL.

02:23.533 --> 02:26.533
CUT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE OPEN--
STERNOTOMIES, CRANIOTOMIES.

02:26.567 --> 02:28.200
THAT'D BE FUN, RIGHT?

02:28.233 --> 02:30.700
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT SURGERIES.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.800
YOU HAVE A FEELING?

02:37.867 --> 02:39.133
YES.

02:39.167 --> 02:41.300
OKAY, WHAT KIND OF FEELING?

02:41.333 --> 02:42.533
LIKE I MIGHT DIE.

02:42.567 --> 02:44.300
TODAY...

02:44.333 --> 02:45.700
TOMORROW, IN 50 YEARS?

02:45.733 --> 02:47.600
'CAUSE WE'RE ALL
GONNA DIE EVENTUALLY.

02:47.633 --> 02:49.133
BUT NOW WE'RE LATE.
LET'S GO.

02:49.167 --> 02:50.567
CRISTINA, COME ON.

02:50.600 --> 02:54.333
(sighs) OKAY.
THIS IS ME BEING SUPPORTIVE.

02:56.733 --> 02:57.667
REALLY?

02:57.700 --> 02:59.600
YEAH. OKAY, FINE.

02:59.633 --> 03:01.533
I'M TOTALLY SUPPORTIVE. GO.

03:04.433 --> 03:07.767
OKAY, THE MAN I LOVE
HAS A WIFE,

03:07.800 --> 03:10.167
AND THEN HE CHOOSES HER
OVER ME,

03:10.200 --> 03:12.100
AND THAT WIFE TAKES MY DOG.

03:12.133 --> 03:15.067
OKAY, SHE DIDN'T TAKE THE DOG,
I GAVE IT TO HER.
YEAH.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.833
BUT I DIDN'T MEAN
TO GIVE IT TO HER,

03:16.867 --> 03:18.767
I MEANT TO GIVE IT TO HIM.
MM-HMM.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.700
BUT THAT DOES NOT CHANGE
THE FACT

03:20.733 --> 03:22.633
THAT SHE'S GOT MY McDREAMY
AND MY McDOG.

03:22.667 --> 03:24.500
SHE'S GOT MY McLIFE.

03:24.533 --> 03:26.267
AND WHAT HAVE I GOT?

03:27.767 --> 03:30.633
DO YOU KNOW I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME WE KISSED?

03:30.667 --> 03:33.533
'CAUSE YOU NEVER THINK
THE LAST TIME IS THE LAST TIME.

03:33.567 --> 03:35.233
YOU THINK THERE'LL BE MORE.

03:35.267 --> 03:38.700
YOU THINK YOU HAVE FOREVER,
BUT YOU DON'T.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.200
PLUS, MY CONDITIONER
DECIDED TO STOP WORKING

03:44.233 --> 03:46.600
AND I THINK I HAVE
BRITTLE BONES.

03:46.633 --> 03:48.600
I JUST...

03:48.633 --> 03:50.533
I JUST NEED SOMETHING
TO HAPPEN.

03:50.567 --> 03:52.700
I NEED A SIGN
THAT THINGS ARE GONNA CHANGE.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.600
I NEED A REASON TO GO ON.
I NEED SOME HOPE.

03:55.633 --> 03:58.500
AND IN THE ABSENCE OF HOPE,
I NEED TO STAY IN BED

03:58.533 --> 04:01.567
AND FEEL LIKE
I MIGHT DIE TODAY.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.733
WHATEVER.
EVERYBODY HAS PROBLEMS.

04:07.767 --> 04:10.767
NOW GET YOUR ASS OUT OF BED
AND GET TO WORK. NOW!

04:10.800 --> 04:12.567
MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!

04:12.600 --> 04:15.133
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?
YEAH, I...

04:15.167 --> 04:17.167
WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

04:19.433 --> 04:22.533
***

04:25.200 --> 04:26.533
OOH, QUIET BOARD.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.067
I KNOW.

04:28.100 --> 04:29.433
THAT'S A BAD SIGN.

04:29.467 --> 04:31.767
I KNOW THAT.
DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT?

04:31.800 --> 04:33.300
THAT'S A QUIET BOARD.

04:33.333 --> 04:34.700
(groans)

04:34.733 --> 04:36.633
IS HE IN A BAD MOOD?

04:36.667 --> 04:39.067
QUIET BOARD.
RIGHT. HE HATES
A QUIET BOARD.

04:39.067 --> 04:41.333
I CAN HEAR YOU TALKING
ABOUT ME.
WE'RE JUST SAYING--

04:41.367 --> 04:44.300
A QUIET BOARD MEANS TROUBLE.
A QUIET BOARD IS DEATH.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.233
A QUIET BOARD BODES BAD NEWS.

04:46.267 --> 04:48.500
AND STOP LOOKIN' AT ME
LIKE THAT.

04:51.267 --> 04:52.767
DR. SHEPHERD.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.133
DR. BURKE.

04:54.167 --> 04:56.067
YOU AND I,
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER

04:56.100 --> 04:57.700
FOR AWHILE NOW, RIGHT?

04:57.733 --> 04:58.767
YES.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.833
WE'VE DONE SEVERAL
SUCCESSFUL SURGERIES TOGETHER.

05:01.867 --> 05:04.600
YES.
YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS
MY EX-GIRLFRIEND'S BEST FRIEND.

05:04.633 --> 05:06.533
YES.

05:06.567 --> 05:09.233
WHY CAN'T WE CALL EACH OTHER
BY OUR FIRST NAME?

05:09.267 --> 05:10.533
I DON'T THINK SO.

05:10.567 --> 05:13.067
SERIOUSLY?

05:13.067 --> 05:14.100
SERIOUSLY.

05:14.133 --> 05:15.333
DR. SHEPHERD.

05:15.367 --> 05:17.367
DR. BURKE.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.700
I HAVEN'T BEEN IN THE O.R.
IN TWO DAYS.

05:20.733 --> 05:22.200
I'M GETTING SOME O.R. TIME.

05:22.233 --> 05:24.133
WE HAVEN'T HAD
A DECENT RESIDENT THIS WEEK.

05:24.167 --> 05:25.567
MM, THE LAST TWO
WEREN'T THAT BAD.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.400
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH
RESIDENT WE GET, THEY SUCK.

05:28.433 --> 05:30.733
(George)
THEY ALL SUCKED.
(Cristina) YEAH.

05:30.767 --> 05:33.367
I MISS DR. BAILEY.

05:34.733 --> 05:38.333
YOU ALL RIGHT?

05:39.800 --> 05:42.133
I HAVE A FEELING.

05:42.167 --> 05:45.100
I GET THOSE.

05:45.133 --> 05:46.567
YEAH?

05:46.600 --> 05:47.533
YEAH.

05:47.567 --> 05:48.500
AND?

05:48.533 --> 05:51.500
IF YOU WAIT LONG ENOUGH,
IT PASSES.

05:51.533 --> 05:53.767
PROMISE?

05:53.800 --> 05:57.367
I PROMISE.

06:03.467 --> 06:04.400
HEY.

06:04.433 --> 06:05.800
WHAT YOU DOIN'?

06:05.833 --> 06:07.733
WAITING FOR IT TO PASS.

06:07.767 --> 06:10.533
FOR WHAT TO PASS?

06:10.567 --> 06:12.467
SO DO YOU WANT
TO DO CHARTS LATER?

06:12.500 --> 06:13.833
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

06:13.867 --> 06:14.800
WHY?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.333
ALEX, I GAVE YOU
YOUR CHANCE.

06:16.367 --> 06:18.533
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE,
AND YOU SLEPT WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

06:18.567 --> 06:21.433
I FORGAVE YOU IN THE SPIRIT
OF BEING A BIGGER PERSON,

06:21.467 --> 06:23.433
OF RISING ABOVE.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.367
BUT THESE LEGS
ARE CLOSED TO YOU NOW.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.067
THE PANTIES ARE STAYING ON.

06:27.100 --> 06:30.167
SO YOU AND ME--
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.833
SO YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO CHARTS LATER?

06:31.867 --> 06:32.833
GO STAND OVER THERE.

06:32.867 --> 06:35.067
CAN WE GET BACK TO THE POINT?
YOU HAD A POINT?

06:35.067 --> 06:37.467
YEAH, WHICH SURGEON ARE WE GONNA
HAVE TO SUCK UP TO TODAY?

06:37.500 --> 06:39.667
THAT WOULD BE ME.
(Cristina) DR. BAILEY.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.600
I'VE BEEN GONE TWO WEEKS--
TWO WEEKS--

06:41.633 --> 06:44.300
AND YOU RAN OFF
TWO RESIDENTS?

06:44.333 --> 06:45.433
I'VE GOT PEOPLE
PHONING ME AT HOME,

06:45.467 --> 06:48.100
SCREAMING, TELLING ME MY INTERNS
ARE ROSEMARY'S BABIES.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.333
NOBODY WANTS YOU.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.267
DO YOU THINK I HAVE
THE TIME FOR THIS?

06:51.300 --> 06:52.500
I AM PREGNANT!

06:52.533 --> 06:54.133
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
ON BED REST.

06:54.167 --> 06:56.700
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE GROWING
A HUMAN BEING.

06:56.733 --> 06:58.733
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE CALM.
DO I LOOK CALM TO YOU?

06:58.767 --> 07:00.767
DID I RAISE YOU FOOLS
TO BE PARIAHS?

07:04.800 --> 07:07.067
YOU'RE BACK.

07:07.067 --> 07:08.433
I'M NOT BACK.

07:08.467 --> 07:10.067
YOU'RE NOT?
GET OFF ME.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.267
(siren whoops)

07:14.300 --> 07:17.167
YANG, KAREV, GREY, STAY HERE
AND WAIT FOR THE INCOMING CASE.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.400
O'MALLEY,
PAGE ADDISON SHEPHERD.

07:18.433 --> 07:19.767
STEVENS, GET A WHEELCHAIR.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.333
A WHEELCHAIR?

07:21.367 --> 07:22.733
A WHEELCHAIR.

07:22.767 --> 07:25.133
WHAT SHOULD I TELL
DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD?
WHAT DID I SAY?

07:25.167 --> 07:26.500
DR. BAILEY?
WHAT?

07:26.533 --> 07:29.067
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL
DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD

07:29.067 --> 07:31.600
WHEN SHE ANSWERS HER PAGE?
(water splashes)

07:31.633 --> 07:33.533
TELL HER MY CONTRACTIONS
ARE TEN MINUTES APART

07:33.567 --> 07:37.567
AND MY WATER JUST BROKE
ALL OVER YOUR SHOES.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.500
GE-GET--
BOY, GET OFF ME!

07:40.533 --> 07:43.733
(siren wailing)

07:43.767 --> 07:46.800
AAH!
(man) TAKE HER!

07:46.833 --> 07:47.833
AAH!

07:47.867 --> 07:52.533
(screaming continues)

07:58.200 --> 07:59.367
DUDE.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.067
YEAH.

08:10.733 --> 08:12.167
(Cristina) JAMES CARLSON,
AGE 46,

08:12.200 --> 08:14.100
PARAMEDICS FOUND HIM
UNCONSCIOUS AND BLEEDING.

08:14.133 --> 08:15.500
MECHANISMS OF INJURY
ARE UNKNOWN.

08:15.533 --> 08:17.433
BUT HE HAS A LARGE,
SUCKING CHEST WOUND

08:17.467 --> 08:19.367
AND A WIFE
WITH VERY HEALTHY LUNGS.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.700
VITALS?

08:20.733 --> 08:23.733
TACHYCARDIC IN THE 140s.
B.P. HOLDING IN THE 90s.

08:23.767 --> 08:25.667
YOU WERE GONE
WHEN I WOKE UP.

08:25.700 --> 08:28.067
OH, UH, I HAD--
I HAD TO DO A THING.

08:28.100 --> 08:30.367
YOU DIDN'T LEAVE A NOTE.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.300
YEAH, WELL, I-I HAD
THIS THING TO DO.

08:32.333 --> 08:34.233
I--YOU KNOW,
I DID THIS THING.

08:34.267 --> 08:35.633
AND ONCE AGAIN...

08:35.667 --> 08:36.733
WHAT?

08:36.767 --> 08:39.200
WE GO TO SLEEP,
I THINK EVERYTHING IS FINE

08:39.233 --> 08:42.100
AND BY THE TIME I WAKE UP,
YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT CRAZY.

08:42.133 --> 08:44.067
I--I'M NOT CRAZY.
I HAD A THING.

08:44.067 --> 08:45.700
OKAY.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.267
HOW'S HIS RESPIRATORY EFFORT?

08:47.300 --> 08:49.200
ABSENT BREATH SOUNDS
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

08:49.233 --> 08:51.133
AIR BUBBLING
AT THE SITE OF THE WOUND.

08:51.167 --> 08:53.133
HE'S SHOCKY AND GETTING
A LITTLE CYANOTIC.

08:53.167 --> 08:54.167
MY WIFE...

08:54.200 --> 08:55.467
(screaming and crying)

08:55.500 --> 08:57.633
LET'S GET HIM INTUBATED

08:57.667 --> 09:00.700
AND PLACE AN OCCLUSIVE DRESSING
OVER THE WOUND.

09:00.733 --> 09:02.067
AND NOW YOU.

09:02.067 --> 09:04.433
UH, HANNAH.
HANNAH DAVIES.

09:04.467 --> 09:06.500
HANNAH, WHY DO YOU HAVE
YOUR HAND INSIDE MY PATIENT?

09:06.533 --> 09:08.800
I'D LIKE TO SAY
FOR THE RECORD

09:08.833 --> 09:10.733
THAT I TOLD HER NOT TO.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.200
I TRIED TO TAMPONADE THE WOUND
WITH GAUZE AND PRESSURE,

09:13.233 --> 09:15.133
BUT THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD
STOP THE BLEEDING WAS MY HAND.

09:15.167 --> 09:17.833
EVERY TIME I TRY TO MOVE IT,
HE STARTS BLEEDING OUT.

09:17.867 --> 09:19.200
CAN I TAKE
MY HAND OUT NOW?

09:19.233 --> 09:21.133
YOU DON'T STICK YOUR HAND
INSIDE OF A PATIENT

09:21.167 --> 09:23.300
WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW HE WAS INJURED.

09:23.333 --> 09:25.633
YOU DON'T STICK YOUR HAND
INSIDE OF A PATIENT AT ALL.
YEAH, I KNOW THAT NOW.

09:25.667 --> 09:27.067
OUT OF MY ROOM.
SHE GETS TO STAY?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.067
SHE HAS HER HAND
STUCK INSIDE OF MY PATIENT.

09:32.567 --> 09:34.233
NICE. THANKS.

09:34.267 --> 09:35.433
WELL, DON'T GET HAPPY.

09:35.467 --> 09:37.433
YOU HAVE YOUR FINGER
ON A MAJOR BLEEDER,

09:37.467 --> 09:40.200
AND MR. CARLSON
IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

09:40.233 --> 09:41.133
THE ONLY THING
THAT YOU HAVE WON

09:41.167 --> 09:43.233
IS AN ALL-EXPENSE-PAID TRIP
TO THE O.R.

09:43.267 --> 09:45.633
DR. GREY, PREPARE
TO TRANSPORT HIM TO THE O.R.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.700
AND LET'S MAKE THIS
HAPPEN QUICKLY, PEOPLE.

09:47.733 --> 09:49.633
(Cristina) WH--UH,
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

09:49.667 --> 09:51.567
I WANT YOU TO MAKE
THAT WOMAN STOP SCREAMING

09:51.600 --> 09:52.767
AND TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.700
I-I CAN'T GO
INTO THE O.R.?

09:54.733 --> 09:56.633
NO, YOU HAVE
"A THING" TO DO.

09:56.667 --> 09:58.333
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

09:58.367 --> 10:00.267
IF I HAD KNOW YOU
WERE GONNA GET THE GOOD CASE,

10:00.300 --> 10:01.700
I WOULDA LET YOU STAY
IN BED.

10:01.733 --> 10:03.133
(screaming)

10:03.167 --> 10:05.067
SHE'S BEEN GOING AT LEAST 15,
20 MINUTES.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.733
THIS MUST BE, LIKE,
SOME KIND OF RECORD.

10:06.767 --> 10:08.667
LOOK AT HER.
SHE'S NOT EVEN TURNING RED.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.600
GOOD FOR HER.
BURKE SAYS SHUT HER UP.

10:10.633 --> 10:12.733
WE'VE GOT
AN INCOMING TRAUMA--

10:12.767 --> 10:14.567
M.V.C. WITH A 30-MINUTE
EXTRICATION TIME,

10:14.600 --> 10:16.733
AND SEVERE INTRUSION DAMAGE
TO THE CAR.

10:16.767 --> 10:18.667
DEFINITE HEAD INJURY. STABLE
VITALS ON EVERYTHING ELSE.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.300
FIVE MINUTES OUT.
(Cristina) I'VE GOT IT.

10:20.333 --> 10:21.500
I GOT IT.
I CALLED IT FIRST.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.567
I THOUGHT YOU SAID BURKE
TOLD YOU TO SHUT HER UP.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.467
OH, NO. BURKE TOLD ME
TO TELL YOU TO SHUT HER UP.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.200
(screaming continues)

10:28.233 --> 10:29.833
(sighs) MA'AM.
MA'AM.

10:29.867 --> 10:32.100
AAH!

10:32.133 --> 10:35.033
MRS. CARLSON...
ARE YOU INJURED?

10:35.067 --> 10:36.667
AAH!

10:36.700 --> 10:38.567
I NEED YOU TO TRY
AND CALM DOWN.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.567
MRS. CARLSON?

10:40.600 --> 10:42.433
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

10:42.467 --> 10:43.633
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

10:43.667 --> 10:46.400
(screaming continues)

10:46.433 --> 10:49.400
AAH!

10:49.433 --> 10:51.600
GOOD. OKAY.

10:51.633 --> 10:53.167
NOW CAN YOU TELL ME

10:53.200 --> 10:55.767
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR HUSBAND?

10:55.800 --> 10:58.800
(stammers)

10:58.833 --> 11:00.133
(cries)

11:00.167 --> 11:03.667
(sobbing)

11:11.433 --> 11:12.733
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:12.767 --> 11:14.433
CHIEF.

11:14.467 --> 11:16.100
BAILEY'S IN THERE.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.067
BAILEY'S BACK?

11:19.167 --> 11:20.267
O'MALLEY!
SHE'S IN LABOR.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.700
DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD IS
EXAMINING HER CERVIX, SIR.

11:22.733 --> 11:25.800
I CAN SEE THAT
QUITE CLEARLY.

11:25.833 --> 11:29.067
O'MALLEY, STOP LOOKING.

11:31.867 --> 11:33.667
PRETTY AMAZING, RIGHT?

11:33.700 --> 11:35.333
THE MIRACLE OF LIFE.

11:35.367 --> 11:38.433
OUR BAILEY
BECOMING A MOTHER,

11:38.467 --> 11:40.133
IT FEELS GOOD.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.833
HAVING BAILEY BACK
AT THE HOSPITAL--

11:42.867 --> 11:45.733
BALANCE IS BEING RESTORED.
THAT'S ALL
I'M SAYIN', SIR.

11:45.767 --> 11:49.100
HEY, GUYS. WOULD YOU, UH, GIVE
THIS TO DR. SHEPHERD FOR ME?

11:49.133 --> 11:51.200
THANKS. WHAT'S GOING ON?
BAILEY'S IN THERE.

11:51.233 --> 11:53.633
OH, BAILEY'S BACK.
THAT'S EXCELLENT.

11:53.667 --> 11:57.467
AND HER CERVIX
IS BEING EXAMINED BY MY WIFE,

11:57.500 --> 12:00.367
WHICH IS, UH, WHICH IS A VISUAL
I'LL NEVER GET OUT OF MY HEAD.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.300
THANKS FOR THE WARNING.
(pager beeps)

12:02.333 --> 12:04.167
RIGHT.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.167
WELL...

12:05.200 --> 12:07.733
A GATHERING OF MEN
OUTSIDE THE DELIVERY ROOM.

12:07.767 --> 12:10.233
HOW MID-CENTURY OF YOU.

12:10.267 --> 12:12.167
SAY HI TO BAILEY
FOR ME.
MM-HMM.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.067
HOW'S SHE DOIN'?
TAKING IT LIKE A WOMAN.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.467
6 CENTIMETERS DILATED,
50% EFFACED,

12:17.500 --> 12:20.367
AND REFUSING ALL PAIN MEDS,
WHICH I THINK IS STUPID,

12:20.400 --> 12:22.633
BUT I'M NOT IN LABOR, SO...

12:22.667 --> 12:24.667
WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE
DOIN' OUT HERE?

12:24.700 --> 12:26.367
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

12:26.400 --> 12:28.300
A BOY THE SIZE OF
A 10-POUND BOWLING BALL

12:28.333 --> 12:30.233
IS WORKING HIS WAY
OUT OF MY BODY.

12:30.267 --> 12:32.167
CAN YOU GIVE ME SOMETHING
FOR THAT?

12:32.200 --> 12:34.100
CAN YOU GIVE ME
A NEW VAGINA?
UH, WELL--

12:34.133 --> 12:36.100
I DIDN'T THINK SO.
LOOK, EVERYBODY,

12:36.133 --> 12:38.767
I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN,
BUT I'M FINE.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.133
IT'S JUST CHILDBIRTH.
ALL I NEED IS MY HUSBAND,

12:41.167 --> 12:43.067
WHO SHOULDA BEEN HERE
BY NOW.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.533
WRITE DOWN HIS NUMBER.
I'LL CALL HIM.

12:45.567 --> 12:47.233
I'LL TRACK HIM DOWN.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.100
ALL RIGHT. THEN GO AWAY.
GIVE ME SOME PRIVACY.

12:50.133 --> 12:52.067
I DON'T WANNA SEE
ANY OF YOU AGAIN

12:52.100 --> 12:54.233
UNTIL AFTER THE BABY
IS BORN,

12:54.267 --> 12:56.167
WHICH, IF HE DOES
LIKE I TOLD HIM TO

12:56.200 --> 12:59.167
AND STAYS ON SCHEDULE, SHOULD BE
IN ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF HOURS.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.800
I MEAN IT.

13:00.833 --> 13:02.733
(door closes)
BAILEY'S BACK.

13:02.767 --> 13:04.500
SHE'S BACK, SIR.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.433
HE'S MY PATIENT, CRISTINA.
GET YOUR OWN.

13:06.467 --> 13:08.400
I HAD ONE.
MEREDITH TOOK HIM.

13:08.433 --> 13:10.400
SO NOW YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE MINE?

13:10.433 --> 13:12.267
IF I CAN.
(man) IS MY WIFE HERE?

13:12.300 --> 13:13.467
IS--IS SHE HERE?

13:13.500 --> 13:16.133
WAS SHE IN THE ACCIDENT
WITH YOU?

13:16.167 --> 13:17.233
SHE SHOULD BE HERE.
SHE'S--SHE'S SUPPOSED TO--

13:17.267 --> 13:19.800
WE'LL FIND HER,
MR. JONES.
OKAY, WHAT DO WE GOT?

13:19.833 --> 13:21.067
TUCKER JONES, AGE 35,
LOST CONTROL OF HIS CAR,

13:21.067 --> 13:23.633
HIT THE GUARDRAIL, FLIPPED--
HE'S GOT A CHEST CONTUSION.

13:23.667 --> 13:26.067
A HEAD C.T. SHOWS A LEFT-SIDED
DEPRESSED SKULL FRACTURE

13:26.100 --> 13:27.600
AND TEMPORAL EPIDURAL HEMATOMA.
G.C.S. 14 IN THE FIELD,

13:27.633 --> 13:29.533
NOW DOWN TO 12.
HIS MOTOR EXAMS ARE INTACT.

13:29.567 --> 13:31.467
OKAY, LET'S GET HIM ON
A GRAM OF DILANTIN

13:31.500 --> 13:33.633
AND 70 GRAMS OF MANNITOL.
I'M ON IT.

13:33.667 --> 13:35.600
MR. JONES, I'M GONNA NEED TO DO
AN EXAMINATION OF YOU, OKAY?

13:35.633 --> 13:37.233
(cell phone ringing)
(Tucker) UH, MY PHONE.

13:37.267 --> 13:38.433
AN-ANSWER. IT'S MY WIFE.

13:38.467 --> 13:40.133
Y-YOU NEED
TO ANSWER...

13:40.167 --> 13:42.067
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA ANSWER
YOUR PHONE.

13:42.067 --> 13:44.667
DR. STEVENS, ANSWER HIS PHONE.
IT'S FINE.
I GOT IT.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.800
MR. JONES, CAN YOU SQUEEZE
MY FINGERS FOR ME, PLEASE?

13:46.833 --> 13:48.700
MR. JONES, I NEED YOU
TO SQUEEZE MY FINGER, OKAY?

13:48.733 --> 13:50.567
CAN YOU--
OKAY, HE'S IN A SEIZURE.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.167
LET'S GET HIM ON HIS SIDE.
WATCH HIS ARM.
HELLO.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.100
HELLO? GEORGE?
WHAT ARE YOU...

13:55.133 --> 13:58.400
IT'S ME, IZZIE.
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET HIM TO THE O.R.

13:58.433 --> 14:00.600
NO, I DON'T. I DON'T HAVE
BAILEY'S HUSBAND'S PHONE.

14:00.633 --> 14:02.400
WHAT ARE YOU--
I THINK I'D KNOW

14:02.433 --> 14:04.433
IF I HAD BAILEY'S
HUSBAND'S PHONE, GEORGE.
(Derek) WATCH HIS ARM.

14:04.467 --> 14:07.133
WHAT'S BAILEY'S
HUSBAND'S NAME?
WATCH THE WALL.

14:10.733 --> 14:12.200
***

14:12.233 --> 14:14.133
HOW ARE YOU DOING
OVER THERE?

14:14.167 --> 14:15.533
MY HAND'S GETTING NUMB.

14:15.567 --> 14:17.067
AND I GOTTA TELL YOU,

14:17.067 --> 14:18.800
THIS WHOLE "INSIDES ARE
BLOODY AND SQUISHY" THING

14:18.833 --> 14:21.400
IS SO NOT GOOD
FOR MY GAG REFLEX.

14:21.433 --> 14:22.767
BUT I'M GOOD.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.200
IS THIS OKAY?

14:25.233 --> 14:26.400
ME BEING IN HERE
LIKE THIS?

14:26.433 --> 14:29.333
ONCE DR. BURKE SCRUBS IN,
HE'LL HAVE YOU REMOVE YOUR HAND.

14:29.367 --> 14:31.267
AND THEN YOU CAN GO,
AND WE'LL FIX MR. CARLSON.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.667
GOOD.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.833
'CAUSE I KNOW
HOW MUCH MEDICINE I KNOW,

14:34.867 --> 14:37.733
AND IT'S JUST ENOUGH
TO NEVER BE ALLOWED IN AN O.R.

14:37.767 --> 14:39.667
IT'S MY SECOND WEEK
AS A PARAMEDIC.

14:39.700 --> 14:42.467
I GOT OUT OF SCHOOL
ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

14:42.500 --> 14:46.267
I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THIS
THAT LONG EITHER.

14:46.300 --> 14:47.567
***

14:47.600 --> 14:51.200
TALK ABOUT
ON-THE-JOB TRAINING, HUH?

14:51.233 --> 14:54.167
***

14:55.167 --> 14:57.200
DR. BURKE.

14:57.233 --> 14:59.667

14:59.700 --> 15:01.833
HEY.

15:01.867 --> 15:03.833
HEY, YOU'VE GOT DR. BAILEY'S
HUSBAND ON THE TABLE?

15:03.867 --> 15:06.433
BAILEY'S HUSBAND
IS GOING INTO SURGERY?

15:06.467 --> 15:07.500
GOT INTO A CAR ACCIDENT

15:07.533 --> 15:09.500
TRYING TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL
BEFORE THE BIRTH.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.333
WHAT DO I TELL BAILEY?
NOTHING.

15:11.367 --> 15:13.267
JUST WAIT TILL I GET IN THERE
AND SEE HOW BAD THE DAMAGE IS,

15:13.300 --> 15:14.367
HAVE SOMETHING CONCRETE
TO TELL HER.

15:14.400 --> 15:17.100
YEAH, NO USE UPSETTING HER
UNTIL WE KNOW.
YEAH.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.300
OKAY, KEEP ME POSTED.
OKAY.

HEY, PRESTON.

***

15:23.133 --> 15:24.600
WHAT?

15:24.633 --> 15:27.233
SHE GETS TO CALL YOU
BY YOUR FIRST NAME AND I DON'T.

15:27.267 --> 15:29.167
I LIKE HER.
AND YOU DON'T LIKE ME?

15:29.200 --> 15:30.633
NO.

15:30.667 --> 15:34.433
***

15:37.333 --> 15:38.467
HOW ARE WE DOIN'?

15:38.500 --> 15:40.200
HE'S STABILIZED.

15:40.233 --> 15:42.133
I'M JUST ABOUT
TO PUT HIM UNDER.

15:42.167 --> 15:43.400
DOCTOR.

15:49.300 --> 15:53.100
Y-YOU'RE... SHEPHERD,
RIGHT?

15:53.133 --> 15:54.733
YES, I AM.

15:54.767 --> 15:57.400
I THOUGHT SO.

15:57.433 --> 15:59.300
MIRANDA...

15:59.333 --> 16:02.167
SHE REALLY LIKES YOU.

16:02.200 --> 16:05.267
I LIKE HER, TOO.

16:05.300 --> 16:09.233
W-WE'RE HAVING A BABY.

16:09.267 --> 16:11.633
I KNOW.

16:11.667 --> 16:13.567
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE
OF YOU.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.500
I'M GONNA GET YOU BACK
TO BAILEY, OKAY?

16:15.533 --> 16:17.233
SAFE AND SOUND.

16:20.333 --> 16:23.267
ALL THIS BLOOD
AND NONE OF IT'S HERS?

16:23.300 --> 16:25.400
YEAH, SHE'S FINE.
ACUTE ANXIETY REACTION.

16:25.433 --> 16:28.100
GIVE HER 2 OF DIAZEPAM P.O.
TO CALM HER DOWN.

16:28.133 --> 16:29.267
SHE IN SHOCK?

16:29.300 --> 16:31.733
I'LL SAY.

16:31.767 --> 16:33.767
CAN YOU TELL US
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED?

16:33.800 --> 16:35.133
I MEAN, THE SHOCK PART.

16:35.167 --> 16:37.567
(scoffs) IT WAS SHOCKING.
I'M SHOCKED.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.833
YOU TELL MY HUSBAND
WHEN I GET MY HANDS ON HIM,

16:39.867 --> 16:41.633
HE'S A DEAD MAN.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.700
DO YOU HEAR ME?
SCARING ME LIKE THIS.

16:44.733 --> 16:46.267
EXACTLY HOW WAS
YOUR HUSBAND INJURED?

16:46.300 --> 16:48.467
(man) MINDY?
MINDY, ARE YOU IN HERE?

16:48.500 --> 16:50.300
I'M OVER HERE,
YOU MORON.

16:50.333 --> 16:53.367
HOW'S JAMES DOING?
OH, HE'S BLEEDING
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.100
THAT'S HOW HE'S DOING.

16:55.133 --> 16:57.700
THE GIRL IN THE AMBULANCE
PUT HER HAND INSIDE OF HIM!

16:57.733 --> 16:59.567
THAT'S HOW HE'S DOING!
WHAT ARE YOU YELLING
AT ME FOR?

16:59.600 --> 17:02.667
BECAUSE! BECAUSE YOU AND JAMES
ARE LIKE IDIOTS,

17:02.700 --> 17:04.600
PLAYING LIKE 8 YEAR OLDS.
EXCUSE ME, UM--

17:04.633 --> 17:06.400
WE DON'T PLAY.
LOOK, WE REENACT.
YOU PLAY.

17:06.433 --> 17:07.700
YOU PUT ON YOUR COSTUMES,

17:07.733 --> 17:10.467
AND YOU BUILD YOUR STUPID TOYS
AND YOU PLAY.
NO, WE REENACT.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.100
NOBODY REENACTS
WORLD WAR II, YOU MORON!

17:13.133 --> 17:15.067
AGAIN,
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED?

17:15.067 --> 17:17.367
YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT HAPPENED IS MY HUSBAND

17:17.400 --> 17:19.733
AND HIS MORON BEST FRIEND--
COULD YOU STOP
CALLING ME A MORON?

17:19.767 --> 17:21.667
MORON BEST FRIEND

17:21.700 --> 17:23.667
DECIDED TO BUILD
SOME KIND OF BIG GUN.

17:23.700 --> 17:25.600
YEAH, AN EXACT REPLICA
OF THE FINEST

17:25.633 --> 17:28.133
ALLIED ANTITANK WEAPON
OF WORLD WAR II,

17:28.167 --> 17:29.500
THE M981 BAZOOKA.

17:29.533 --> 17:31.433
SO THEY PUT ON
THEIR STUPID COSTUMES,

17:31.467 --> 17:33.400
AND THEY GO OUT
INTO THE BACKYARD,

17:33.433 --> 17:35.433
AND THEY TRY
TO SHOOT THE THING.

17:35.467 --> 17:37.367
I'M THE GUNNER.
JAMES IS THE LOADER, OKAY?

17:37.400 --> 17:39.467
WE FOLLOWED THE SPECIFICATIONS
EXACTLY. YOU SHOULD SEE IT.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.400
IT'S A 60-MILLIMETER,
1 1/2-POUND ROCKET--

17:41.433 --> 17:42.800
I MEAN, IT'S A BEAUTY.

17:42.833 --> 17:45.267
IT DIDN'T WORK,
SO LIKE AN IDIOT,

17:45.300 --> 17:48.100
MY HUSBAND HAS TO GO AND STAND
IN FRONT OF HIS BIG GUN

17:48.133 --> 17:49.633
TO SEE WHAT WENT WRONG.

17:49.667 --> 17:52.400
THAT'S WHEN THE STUPID TOY
STARTS WORKING.

17:52.433 --> 17:53.600
STOP CALLING IT A TOY.

17:53.633 --> 17:56.333
IT'S TAKING UP HALF MY GARAGE.
I'LL CALL IT WHATEVER I WANT!

17:56.367 --> 17:59.300
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, HOLD ON.
HE SHOT HIMSELF WITH A BAZOOKA?

17:59.333 --> 18:01.300
YEAH.

18:01.333 --> 18:03.167
HE SHOT HIMSELF
WITH A BAZOOKA?

18:03.200 --> 18:06.333
LIKE I SAID, MORONS,
THE PAIR OF 'EM.
WAS THERE AN EXPLOSION?

18:06.367 --> 18:07.400
HUH?

18:07.433 --> 18:10.667
WAS THERE AN EXPLOSION?
NO, WHY?

18:10.700 --> 18:12.133
OH, CRAP.

18:15.733 --> 18:19.067
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

18:24.600 --> 18:26.367
HEY, SLOW DOWN.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.067
(saw whirrs)

18:28.100 --> 18:31.500
IF BAILEY ASKS,
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO DID THIS.

18:31.533 --> 18:33.233
(whirring)

18:38.600 --> 18:41.200
(dials number)

18:42.667 --> 18:44.567
OKAY, EVERYBODY,
I'M GOING TO DO A THORACOTOMY,

18:44.600 --> 18:46.500
AND HANNAH HERE
IS GOING TO PULL HER HAND OUT.

18:46.533 --> 18:49.167
DR. GREY IS GOING TO
CLAMP THE BLEEDER

18:49.200 --> 18:51.100
WHEN WE HAVE MORE EXPOSURE.

18:51.133 --> 18:52.300
YOU READY?

18:52.333 --> 18:54.067
MORE THAN READY.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.367
SCALPEL.

18:58.167 --> 19:01.133
(cell phone rings)

19:02.567 --> 19:04.467
(ring)

19:04.500 --> 19:06.067
UH, TUCKER JONES,

19:06.067 --> 19:08.633
YOU BETTER BE LYING
IN THE STREET

19:08.667 --> 19:10.333
SOMEWHERE DEAD, MISTER,

19:10.367 --> 19:13.567
BECAUSE WHEN I GET
MY HANDS ON YOU--

19:13.600 --> 19:16.567
I AM HAVING YOUR BABY HERE,
MISTER!

19:18.567 --> 19:21.233
(Preston) OKAY,
ON THE COUNT OF THREE.

19:21.267 --> 19:23.133
ONE...

19:24.833 --> 19:26.067
TWO...

19:28.733 --> 19:30.100
OHH.

19:30.133 --> 19:32.767
(Alex) DR. BURKE.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.267
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.167
I'M IN SURGERY, KAREV.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.233
YOU WANT TO TALK
TO ME, SIR.

19:39.267 --> 19:41.067
(pants)

19:47.233 --> 19:49.200
UNHOOK ME.

19:53.633 --> 19:55.533
KAREV, IF YOU INTERRUPT ME
IN MY O.R.,

19:55.567 --> 19:57.667
IT BETTER BE
FOR A GOOD DAMN REASON.

19:57.700 --> 19:59.433
WAS IT THROUGH AND THROUGH?
WHAT?

19:59.467 --> 20:01.367
THE WOUND ON JAMES CARLSON,
WAS IT THROUGH AND THROUGH?

20:01.400 --> 20:03.367
NO, IT WAS JUST AN ENTRY.
NO EXIT. WHY?

20:03.400 --> 20:05.033
(sighs)

20:05.067 --> 20:06.400
HE'S CUTE.

20:06.433 --> 20:08.167
HE SINGLE?

20:08.200 --> 20:11.233
(indistinct whispering)

20:17.167 --> 20:20.167
(whispering continues)

20:26.233 --> 20:28.133
HANNAH.

20:28.167 --> 20:29.333
YES, DR. BURKE.

20:29.367 --> 20:32.700
WHAT DO YOU FEEL
INSIDE OF MR. CARLSON?

20:32.733 --> 20:34.667
WHAT IS YOUR HAND TOUCHING?

20:34.700 --> 20:36.700
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:36.733 --> 20:39.700
IS YOUR HAND TOUCHING
ANYTHING HARD?

20:39.733 --> 20:41.400
(Meredith) HARD?

20:41.433 --> 20:43.433
LIKE METAL.

20:43.467 --> 20:45.300
UM... I DON'T KNOW.

20:45.333 --> 20:47.233
DON'T MOVE YOUR HAND.

20:47.267 --> 20:49.167
JUST TELL ME...

20:49.200 --> 20:51.067
WHAT YOU FEEL.

20:51.100 --> 20:53.367
DR. BURKE,
WHAT'S GOING ON?
HANNAH.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.367
UM, MY FINGERTIPS
ARE TOUCHING SOMETHING...

20:56.400 --> 20:58.667
KINDA HARD.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.700
YEAH. YEAH, DEFINITELY.

21:00.733 --> 21:02.800
OH, MY GOD.
DR. MILTON.

21:02.833 --> 21:05.467
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

21:05.500 --> 21:08.533
(Preston) HANNAH,
I DON'T WANT YOU TO MOVE--

21:08.567 --> 21:10.267
NOT YOUR HAND,
NOT YOUR BODY,

21:10.300 --> 21:11.367
NOT AN INCH.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.233
OKAY. YOU SHOULD KNOW
YOU'RE STARTING TO SCARE ME.

21:14.267 --> 21:15.600
DON'T BE SCARED.

21:15.633 --> 21:18.067
EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE FINE.

21:18.067 --> 21:21.133
DR. GREY, CAN YOU...

21:27.633 --> 21:30.500
I WANT YOU TO WALK
OUT OF THIS ROOM--

21:30.533 --> 21:32.433
WALK, DO NOT RUN--

21:32.467 --> 21:34.367
GO AND TELL THE CHARGE NURSE

21:34.400 --> 21:38.067
THAT WE HAVE A CODE BLACK.

21:39.267 --> 21:41.167
I'M SORRY, "CODE BLACK"?

21:41.200 --> 21:43.800
CODE BLACK.
TELL HIM THAT I AM SURE,

21:43.833 --> 21:48.067
AND THEN TELL HIM
TO CALL THE BOMB SQUAD.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.167
GOD, CAN YOU IMAGINE?

21:57.200 --> 21:58.300
WHAT'D SHE STICK HER HAND
IN THERE FOR ANYWAY?

21:58.333 --> 22:00.233
SHE WAS TRYING
TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

22:00.267 --> 22:02.500
AND NOW SHE MIGHT DIE
BECAUSE OF IT.

22:02.533 --> 22:04.067
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

22:04.100 --> 22:06.633
I GO BACK IN
AND WAIT FOR THE BOMB SQUAD.

22:06.667 --> 22:11.167
YOU LEAVE.
YOU ALL LEAVE.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.800
MERE, YOU COMIN'?

22:15.500 --> 22:17.767
IT'S YOUR FUNERAL.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.400
YOU NEED A SURGICAL TEAM.

22:19.433 --> 22:21.467
ALL I NEED IS DR. MILTON
TO KEEP HIM UNDER.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.500
I CAN DO THE REST MYSELF.

22:26.133 --> 22:28.067
(sighs)

22:32.233 --> 22:35.100
FINE. BUT YOU WAIT
BY THE ELEVATOR.

22:35.133 --> 22:36.500
I DON'T WANT ANYONE IN HERE

22:36.533 --> 22:38.667
THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE
IN THIS O.R.

22:38.700 --> 22:41.333
WHEN THE BOMB SQUAD ARRIVES,
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE.

22:41.367 --> 22:43.567
UNTIL THEN, MILTON AND I
ARE DOING THIS ALONE.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.567
NOW, GO.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.600
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

22:54.633 --> 22:55.733
AAH!

22:55.767 --> 22:57.700
(breathes rhythmically)

22:57.733 --> 22:59.567
EIGHT MINUTES APART.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.567
THERE IS NO SHAME
IN AN EPIDURAL, MIRANDA.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.800
EPIDURAL INCREASES
THE POSSIBILITY OF A C-SECTION.

23:04.833 --> 23:06.533
IT ALSO DECREASES PAIN.

23:06.567 --> 23:09.167
MIRANDA, THIS IS A BIG BABY,
IT IS YOUR FIRST BABY,

23:09.200 --> 23:11.467
AND I AM TELLING YOU,
IT IS NOT GONNA BE A SHORT

23:11.500 --> 23:13.200
OR AN EASY LABOR.

23:13.233 --> 23:15.133
I CAN HANDLE A LITTLE PAIN.
NO PROBLEM.

23:15.167 --> 23:17.367
WOMEN ALL OVER THE WORLD
DO THIS AT HOME...

23:17.400 --> 23:20.567
(Addison) MM-HMM.
WITH NOTHING MORE
THAN A PAIR OF SCISSORS

23:20.600 --> 23:22.633
AND A BUCKET OF HOT WATER.

23:22.667 --> 23:25.100
WELL, WOMEN ALL OVER THE WORLD
ALSO DIE GIVING BIRTH AT HOME

23:25.133 --> 23:26.567
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

23:29.233 --> 23:30.767
(whispers)
I DID NOT JUST SAY--

23:30.800 --> 23:32.700
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
MAKING YOURSELF USEFUL

23:32.733 --> 23:35.200
AND FINDING MY HUSBAND.
WELL, I-I--

23:35.233 --> 23:37.400
HE'S NOT... HERE.

23:37.433 --> 23:40.067
OH, NOW HE SHOULD
BE HERE BY NOW.

23:40.100 --> 23:41.667
(Addison) OKAY,
WE'RE GONNA GO FIND HIM,

23:41.700 --> 23:43.533
RIGHT, DR. O'MALLEY?
RIGHT.

23:43.567 --> 23:45.067
(pager beeps)

23:46.600 --> 23:48.667
WHAT?

23:48.700 --> 23:54.267
UH, NOTHING.
I'LL--I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

23:54.300 --> 23:58.400
(pager beeping)

23:58.433 --> 24:01.800
YANG, COULD YOU CHECK THAT?

24:01.833 --> 24:03.767
(Izzie) HOW'S HE DOING?

24:03.800 --> 24:06.267
AH, IT'S TOUCH AND GO.
I'VE LOCATED THE CLOT.

24:06.300 --> 24:08.667
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND
THE SOURCE OF THE BLEEDING.

24:08.700 --> 24:10.067
GO AND FIND ADDISON,

24:10.067 --> 24:13.133
AND TELL HER HE'S
IN WORSE SHAPE THAN I THOUGHT.

24:15.567 --> 24:17.200
WHAT'D THEY WANT?

24:17.233 --> 24:19.333
THEY WANT US TO EVACUATE.

24:19.367 --> 24:20.300
EVACUATE?
DID THEY SAY WHY?

24:20.333 --> 24:22.600
UH, NO, BUT YOUR PAGER
SAID, "CODE BLACK."

24:22.633 --> 24:24.800
YOU'RE SURE THEY SAID THAT?

24:24.833 --> 24:26.700
YES.

24:26.733 --> 24:28.733
IT COULD BE A DRILL.

24:28.767 --> 24:31.233
EVEN IF IT'S NOT A DRILL,
I CAN'T EVACUATE.

24:31.267 --> 24:33.167
I'VE GOT AN OPEN BRAIN
ON THE TABLE.

24:33.200 --> 24:36.500
I'M NOT LEAVING
BAILEY'S HUSBAND ON THE TABLE

24:36.533 --> 24:38.333
WITH HIS SKULL FLAP OPEN,

24:38.367 --> 24:40.333
SO IF ANYBODY WANTS TO GO,
THEY SHOULD GO.

24:40.367 --> 24:41.700
ANYBODY WANT TO EVACUATE?

24:41.733 --> 24:46.367
GOING ONCE, GOING TWICE,
THREE TIMES.

24:47.500 --> 24:50.200
YOU'RE SURE THEY SAID,
"CODE BLACK"?

24:50.233 --> 24:52.100
YES.

24:52.133 --> 24:54.067
(elevator bell dings)

24:54.067 --> 24:55.800
I DON'T LIKE HAVING
TO LIE TO DR. BAILEY.

24:55.833 --> 24:59.400
SHE WOULD WANT--
NOW IS NOT THE TIME,
DR. O'MALLEY.

24:59.433 --> 25:01.333
SHE'D WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT HER HUSBAND.

25:01.367 --> 25:03.700
(pager beeps)

25:03.733 --> 25:06.600
"CODE BLACK"?
WHAT'S A CODE BLACK.
(Izzie) WAIT, WAIT, HOLD IT.

25:06.633 --> 25:08.333
WHOA. DR. SHEPHERD,

25:08.367 --> 25:10.267
THE OTHER DR. SHEPHERD
WANTED ME TO LET YOU KNOW

25:10.300 --> 25:12.167
THAT TUCKER'S BLEED
IS MORE EXTENSIVE

25:12.200 --> 25:13.333
THAN HE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.

25:13.367 --> 25:15.267
IT'S GONNA BE A FEW MORE HOURS

25:15.300 --> 25:17.200
BEFORE HE HAS ANYTHING CONCRETE
TO TELL DR. BAILEY.

25:17.233 --> 25:19.800
THANKS, STEVENS.
WHAT'S A CODE BLACK?

25:19.833 --> 25:21.500
A WHAT?

25:21.533 --> 25:22.700
(pager beeps)

25:22.733 --> 25:24.533
"CODE BLACK"?

25:24.567 --> 25:26.067
CODE RED, CODE BLUE,
CODE WHITE--

25:26.100 --> 25:28.333
I'VE NEVER HAD A CODE BLACK.
DR. SHEPHERD?

25:28.367 --> 25:30.200
JUST--JUST GO BACK
TO YOUR LOCKER ROOM

25:30.233 --> 25:33.100
AND WAIT FOR YOUR RESIDENT
TO GIVE YOU INSTRUCTIONS.

25:33.133 --> 25:35.067
WE DON'T HAVE A RESIDENT.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:35.067 --> 25:38.133
IS IT SOMETHING BAD?

25:38.167 --> 25:40.067
(bell dings)

25:40.067 --> 25:43.167
(everyone talking at once)

25:43.200 --> 25:45.067
YEAH, IT'S SOMETHING BAD.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.167
(everyone talking at once)

25:53.533 --> 25:55.267
SO...

25:55.300 --> 26:00.433
SO I'M TOUCHING LIVE...
UNEXPLODED AMMUNITION?

26:00.467 --> 26:02.500
I'M AFRAID SO.

26:02.533 --> 26:03.800
(sighs)

26:03.833 --> 26:07.667
NOT THE GREATEST FEELING
IN THE WORLD.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.667
NO. (chuckles)

26:09.700 --> 26:11.767
I GUESS NOT.

26:13.533 --> 26:15.433
AND HE'S STILL OUT?

26:15.467 --> 26:16.633
(Milton) YEAH.

26:16.667 --> 26:19.167
BUT HE'S NOT HOOKED UP
TO THE MACHINE ANYMORE?

26:19.200 --> 26:22.067
I HAD DR. MILTON
TAKE HIM OFF THE VENTILATOR.

26:22.067 --> 26:24.467
THE FLOW OF OXYGEN
POSED A DANGER.

26:24.500 --> 26:28.733
THE AMBU BAG IS...
BREATHING FOR HIM NOW.

26:28.767 --> 26:31.133
BUT HE CAN'T HEAR ME?

26:31.167 --> 26:33.667
NO.

26:42.433 --> 26:44.367
HANNAH.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.600
(exhales)

26:46.633 --> 26:50.133
WHAT IF I JUST TAKE MY HAND OUT
REALLY QUICKLY?

26:50.167 --> 26:52.833
WE'D HAVE TO ASK
THE BOMB SQUAD THAT

26:52.867 --> 26:54.767
WHEN THEY ARRIVE,
BUT I'M GUESSING

26:54.800 --> 26:57.700
THAT WOULD CAUSE THE AMMO
TO SHIFT AND EXPLODE.

27:00.100 --> 27:01.800
OH.

27:11.333 --> 27:13.833
HANNAH.

27:13.867 --> 27:15.800
YEAH.

27:15.833 --> 27:20.200
YOUR HAND IS KEEPING
MR. CARLSON FROM BLEEDING OUT.

27:20.233 --> 27:24.667
YOU ARE KEEPING HIM ALIVE.

27:26.333 --> 27:27.367
RIGHT.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.300
AN--AND THE BOMB SQUAD
IS COMING?

27:29.333 --> 27:32.467
THE BOMB SQUAD IS COMING.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.400
OKAY.

27:36.133 --> 27:38.233
OKAY.

27:46.300 --> 27:48.433
(Richard) WE ARE HAVING

27:48.467 --> 27:49.400
PRE-OP PATIENTS
TRANSPORTED TO MERCY WEST.

27:49.433 --> 27:50.767
ALL TRAUMA REROUTED
TO SEATTLE PRESBYTERIAN.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.300
THERE IS NO DANGER
TO THE NORTH, SOUTH

27:53.333 --> 27:56.633
AND WEST WINGS OF THIS HOSPITAL,
JUST THE EAST SURGICAL WING.

27:56.667 --> 27:59.567
THAT SAID, ANYONE WHO WANTS
TO LEAVE CAN LEAVE.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.500
NO ONE STAYS
UNLESS THEY VOLUNTEER TO STAY.

28:01.533 --> 28:03.067
UNDERSTOOD?

28:03.067 --> 28:04.433
OKAY.

28:04.467 --> 28:06.733
RICHARD, IT'S A CODE BLACK,
A REAL ONE?

28:06.767 --> 28:08.667
YES, I'VE SHUT DOWN
THE O.R.'s.

28:08.700 --> 28:10.600
TO TRAUMA?
TO EVERYTHING.

28:10.633 --> 28:12.533
WAIT A MINUTE,
TO "EVERYTHING" EVERYTHING?

28:12.567 --> 28:14.467
AS OF TEN MINUTES AGO,
ALL THE OPERATING ROOMS

28:14.500 --> 28:16.400
AT SEATTLE GRACE WERE
COMPLETELY EVACUATED,

28:16.433 --> 28:18.333
WITH THE EXCEPTION
FO DR. BURKE'S TEAM.

28:18.367 --> 28:20.367
AND DR. SHEPHERD'S TEAM.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.300
WHAT?

28:21.333 --> 28:23.367
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"DR. SHEPHERD'S TEAM"?

28:23.400 --> 28:26.467
THEY'RE STILL IN O.R. TWO.

28:26.500 --> 28:29.667
THE BOMB SQUAD JUST ARRIVED.
EXCUSE ME.

28:29.700 --> 28:31.067
(elevator bell dings)

28:31.100 --> 28:32.567
YOU'RE THE SURGICAL TEAM?

28:32.600 --> 28:33.533
YES.

28:33.567 --> 28:34.767
DYLAN YOUNG, BOMB SQUAD.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.433
SPREAD OUT, CHECK THE AREA,

28:36.467 --> 28:38.433
AND THEN WE'LL SECURE
THE PATIENT. WHERE ARE THEY?

28:38.467 --> 28:41.267
DR. BURKE HAS THEM
IN THERE.
AND THE REST OF THIS FLOOR
HAS BEEN EVACUATED?

28:41.300 --> 28:42.400
IT HAS, YES.

28:42.433 --> 28:46.367
ALL RIGHT, YOU STAY HERE.
NOBODY MOVES UNLESS I SAY SO.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.833
(man) WE'VE GOT PEOPLE
OVER HERE!

28:48.867 --> 28:51.067
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THE FLOOR HAD BEEN EVACUATED.

28:51.067 --> 28:52.767
(Meredith) I THOUGHT IT HAD.
I'M NOT IN CHARGE OF ANYTHING.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.300
THIS IS A STERILE AREA.
YOU CAN'T COME IN.
CRISTINA!

28:54.333 --> 28:56.333
SERIOUSLY, BACK UP.
OH, NO, NO.
SHE WILL HURT HIM.

28:56.367 --> 28:58.167
WHAT'S GOING ON?
BOMB IN A BODY CAVITY.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.533
MAN.

29:00.567 --> 29:04.067
ALL I GOT IS
BAILEY'S HUSBAND'S OPEN BRAIN.

29:04.100 --> 29:05.833
WHAT PROCEDURE?
CRANIOTOMY WITH SHEPHERD.

29:05.867 --> 29:08.200
SHEPHERD'S GOT BAILEY'S HUSBAND
ON THE TABLE?
EXCUSE ME.

29:08.233 --> 29:10.400
BAILEY'S HAVING A BABY
RIGHT NOW.
EXCUSE ME! STOP TALKING.

29:10.433 --> 29:12.100
JEEZ. (mouths words)

29:13.600 --> 29:18.067
(people talking indistinctly)

29:25.700 --> 29:29.100
GOTTA EAT SOMETHING.

29:30.667 --> 29:32.633
YOU KNEW MEREDITH AND CRISTINA
WOULD BE ON THE FLOOR

29:32.667 --> 29:34.200
WITH THE BOMB.
YEAH.

29:34.233 --> 29:36.133
IS IT WRONG
THAT WE'RE JEALOUS?

29:36.167 --> 29:38.067
IT'S ALL RIGHT THAT
WE'RE JEALOUS, RIGHT?

29:38.100 --> 29:39.400
THE FACT THAT WE'RE JEALOUS

29:39.433 --> 29:41.400
BECAUSE THEY MIGHT
BLOW UP AND DIE

29:41.433 --> 29:43.333
IS NOT A REFLECTION
ON OUR CHARACTER.

29:43.367 --> 29:44.700
IT'S ABOUT FEELING USELESS.
INEFFECTUAL.

29:44.733 --> 29:47.600
WE COULDN'T EVEN GET MEREDITH
OUT OF BED THIS MORNING.

29:47.633 --> 29:49.133
WE HAD TO CALL IN CRISTINA.

29:49.167 --> 29:50.633
HOW EMBARRASSING IS THAT?

29:50.667 --> 29:52.567
YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK, GEORGE?

29:52.600 --> 29:55.600
I THINK MEREDITH
AND CRISTINA ARE DOERS.

29:55.633 --> 29:58.233
THEY DO. THEY'RE DOERS.

29:58.267 --> 29:59.600
THEY DO AND WE...

29:59.633 --> 30:01.133
(sighs)

30:01.167 --> 30:03.500
WE WATCH.

30:04.533 --> 30:06.733
WE'RE WATCHERS.

30:08.667 --> 30:09.833
(Alex)
CHECK MRS. CARLSON'S LEVELS.

30:09.867 --> 30:12.833
IF THEY ARE STABLE,
SHE CAN COME UP HERE.

30:12.867 --> 30:14.500
EXCUSE ME.

30:14.533 --> 30:17.267
WE HAVE TO BECOME
MORE PROACTIVE, GEORGE.

30:17.300 --> 30:20.767
WE HAVE TO BECOME DOERS.

30:20.800 --> 30:23.433
(George) FIGHT FOR
WHAT WE WANT.

30:23.467 --> 30:24.633
WE HAVE TO DO.

30:24.667 --> 30:26.467
YEAH.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.133
OH, YOU MEAN...

30:28.167 --> 30:31.633
WE ARE STARTING RIGHT NOW.
OKAY.

30:31.667 --> 30:34.167
***

30:34.200 --> 30:35.133
ALEX.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.700
HOW CRAZY IS THIS?

30:36.733 --> 30:38.767
DUDE, IT'S LIKE
THE APOCALYPSE.
ALEX.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.300
IT'S TRUE.
I MEAN, LOOK AROUND YOU--

30:40.333 --> 30:42.233
HALF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE SAVING LIVES

30:42.267 --> 30:44.200
HAVE FLED THE BUILDING
TO SAVE THEMSELVES,

30:44.233 --> 30:46.633
BAILEY'S HUSBAND ALMOST DIED
COMING TO SEE HIS KID GET BORN,

30:46.667 --> 30:48.567
THE ANNOYING TWINS ARE DOWN
ON THE O.R. FLOOR WITH A GUY

30:48.600 --> 30:50.367
WHO LITERALLY MIGHT EXPLODE
IN THEIR FACES.

30:50.400 --> 30:51.733
IT'S A MORGUE WAITING
TO HAPPEN IN HERE.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.767
I'M JUST SAYING, PEOPLE SHOULD
GET WHILE THE GETTING'S GOOD

30:53.800 --> 30:55.633
BECAUSE THERE MIGHT NOT BE
A TOMORROW.
ALEX!

30:55.667 --> 30:58.233
WHAT?

30:58.267 --> 31:01.267
***

31:03.400 --> 31:04.700
TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS.

31:04.733 --> 31:06.467
IZZIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:06.500 --> 31:07.700
I'M BEING A DOER.

31:07.733 --> 31:09.667
GETTING WHILE THE GETTING'S
GOOD. NOW TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS.

31:09.700 --> 31:11.600
YOU DO REALIZE THAT WHEN I SAID
"THE APOCALYPSE,"

31:11.633 --> 31:13.833
I MEANT IT METAPHORICALLY,
NOT LITERALLY?

31:13.867 --> 31:15.233
ALEX...

31:15.267 --> 31:18.367
I HAVEN'T HAD SEX
IN 8 MONTHS AND 12 DAYS.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.300
I'M HORNY, I'M HALF-NAKED,
AND I'M SAYING YES.

31:20.333 --> 31:22.233
YOU WANT TO STAND THERE
AND TALK METAPHORS

31:22.267 --> 31:25.200
OR DO YOU WANT TO LITERALLY
TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS?

31:25.233 --> 31:29.700
***

31:32.200 --> 31:34.533
(Dylan) DR. SHEPHERD,
THERE'S AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE

31:34.567 --> 31:37.533
IN THE O.R. NEXT DOOR.
I NEED YOU TO EVACUATE NOW.

31:37.567 --> 31:40.800
YEAH, AND I'VE GOT A GUY WHOSE
BRAIN IS EXPOSED ON THIS TABLE.

31:40.833 --> 31:42.333
I'M NOT GONNA WALK AWAY
AND LEAVE HIM TO DIE.

31:42.367 --> 31:44.567
THE REST OF YOU CAN GO.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.267
YOU SHOULD GO.
SUCTION.

32:04.233 --> 32:05.733
YOU CLOSE HIM UP.

32:05.767 --> 32:07.667
YOU DO
WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO.

32:07.700 --> 32:09.800
THE CHIEF OF SURGERY
HAS AUTHORIZED ME TO TELL YOU

32:09.833 --> 32:11.467
YOU CANNOT STAY HERE.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.400
THE CHIEF OF SURGERY
DOESN'T SCARE ME.

32:13.433 --> 32:15.433
DR. BAILEY SCARES ME.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.367
I'M NOT GONNA BE THE ONE
TO TELL HER HER HUSBAND DIED,

32:17.400 --> 32:19.500
AND THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF WE PUT HIS SKULL FLAP ON

32:19.533 --> 32:21.433
IN THIS CONDITION,
BOMB OR NO BOMB.

32:21.467 --> 32:24.267
NOW GET OUT OF MY O.R.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.500
SUCTION.

32:28.533 --> 32:32.600
(sighs)

32:32.633 --> 32:35.700
(panting)

32:36.667 --> 32:39.533
I'M TRYING TO GET GRAVITY
TO DO ME A FAVOR.

32:39.567 --> 32:42.400
I'M 9 CENTIMETERS DILATED.
I NEED THAT LAST CENTIMETER.

32:42.433 --> 32:45.400
GOOD. THAT'S, UH...

32:45.433 --> 32:46.800
THAT'S GOOD.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.467
DR. SHEPHERD.

32:54.733 --> 33:00.767
WHERE... EXACTLY
IS MY HUSBAND?

33:07.233 --> 33:09.500
HE'S WITH MY HUSBAND.

33:11.367 --> 33:13.367
TUCKER WAS IN...

33:13.400 --> 33:15.500
OH...

33:15.533 --> 33:17.800
THERE'S NO TELLING
HOW DANGEROUS IT IS.

33:17.833 --> 33:20.800
WE NEED MORE INFO.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.467
THE LONGER WE WAIT,

33:24.500 --> 33:27.600
THE GREATER THE CHANCE
HE'LL BLEED OUT AND DIE.

33:34.200 --> 33:37.200
PINK MIST.

33:37.233 --> 33:39.067
EXCUSE ME?

33:42.367 --> 33:45.700
THAT'S WHAT THE BOMB SQUAD
CALLS YOU WHEN YOU BLOW UP.

33:45.733 --> 33:47.200
PINK MIST.

33:47.233 --> 33:50.633
I READ THAT SOMEWHERE.

33:50.667 --> 33:53.633
THE BOMB GOES OFF AND...

33:53.667 --> 33:57.333
ANYONE IN RANGE EXPLODES
INTO A BILLION PIECES.

33:57.367 --> 34:01.167
YOU'RE LIQUID.
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.

34:01.200 --> 34:07.333
JUST FLECKS OF HUMAN FLESH
AND BLOOD.

34:07.367 --> 34:11.533
PINK MIST.

34:11.567 --> 34:14.467
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T EVEN FIND
A FINGER.

34:14.500 --> 34:17.800
ONE MINUTE YOU'RE A PERSON...

34:17.833 --> 34:21.233
THE NEXT, YOU'RE...

34:21.267 --> 34:23.200
BLOODY RAIN.

34:31.667 --> 34:34.200
HERE, TAKE THIS.

34:34.233 --> 34:35.167
WHAT?

34:35.200 --> 34:37.400
GO AHEAD.

34:37.433 --> 34:42.533
NOW I WANT YOU TO SQUEEZE IT
IN EVEN BEATS, OKAY?

34:42.567 --> 34:45.200
NO, NOT TOO FAST.
NOT TOO FAST.

34:45.233 --> 34:47.467
THERE YOU GO.

34:56.200 --> 34:59.067
DR. MILTON?

35:06.800 --> 35:09.067
I'VE GOT KIDS.

35:11.233 --> 35:13.600
EVEN BEATS.

35:13.633 --> 35:16.167
OKAY?

35:17.733 --> 35:20.400
THAT'S IT.

35:36.733 --> 35:38.633
(Mindy)
WHAT--WHAT ABOUT MY HUSBAND?

35:38.667 --> 35:40.567
HOW LONG CAN HE STAY
LIKE THAT,

35:40.600 --> 35:42.800
WITH LIVE AMMO INSIDE HIM?

35:42.833 --> 35:45.067
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.

35:45.067 --> 35:47.067
BUT YOU'RE GONNA TRY
TO SAVE HIM, RIGHT?

35:47.067 --> 35:48.433
WE'RE GONNA TRY.

35:48.467 --> 35:50.500
FIRST, THE BOMB SQUAD
HAS TO DETERMINE

35:50.533 --> 35:53.200
THE BEST WAY
TO RETRIEVE THE DEVICE.
I'M SORRY, MINDY.
I'M SO SORRY.

35:53.233 --> 35:55.100
SHUT UP!

35:55.133 --> 35:56.433
WE'VE GOT THREE KIDS,

35:56.467 --> 35:59.567
AND YOU'VE GOT HIM
BUILDING BAZOOKAS.

36:02.333 --> 36:04.667
OH, GOD.

36:05.667 --> 36:08.500
(cries) HE'S GONNA DIE.

36:08.533 --> 36:10.767
UH, PAUL, WHY DON'T YOU GO
WITH THE OFFICER THERE

36:10.800 --> 36:13.400
AND ANSWER HIS QUESTIONS ABOUT
THE DEVICE YOU GUYS BUILT?

36:13.433 --> 36:15.333
OH, ANYTHING.
ANYTHING TO HELP.

36:15.367 --> 36:19.067
UH, KAREV, WHY DON'T WE GET
MRS. CARLSON A CUP OF COFFEE?

36:19.067 --> 36:21.467
I-I GUESS I SHOULD LOOK
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

36:21.500 --> 36:25.067
IT'S NOT LIKE THIS
CAN GET ANY WORSE.

36:25.100 --> 36:28.767
I MEAN... THIS IS IT.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.500
THIS IS AS BAD AS IT GETS.

36:31.533 --> 36:34.200
RIGHT?

36:39.333 --> 36:40.633
DR. BAILEY...

36:40.667 --> 36:42.333
UM, I WAS...

36:42.367 --> 36:44.500
DR. BAILEY, WHAT ARE YOU--
GET SOMEONE TO FIND ME
MY SUITCASE.

36:44.533 --> 36:47.067
I NEED MY SUITCASE.
I'M GOIN' HOME.

36:47.067 --> 36:49.200
DR. BAILEY,
YOU'RE HAVING A BABY.

36:49.233 --> 36:51.133
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE
ANY BABY BORN TODAY.

36:51.167 --> 36:52.533
YOU HEAR ME?
I'M HOLDING IT IN.

36:52.567 --> 36:54.467
I'LL HAVE HIM TOMORROW.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.400
JUST NOT NOW.
NOT LIKE THIS.

36:56.433 --> 36:59.667
NO! JUST...

36:59.700 --> 37:01.267
NO.

37:01.300 --> 37:02.733
(cries) I'M GOIN' HOME.

37:02.767 --> 37:04.400
I'M GOIN' HOME RIGHT NOW.

37:04.433 --> 37:06.200
(groans)

37:09.100 --> 37:12.333
I CAN'T. (cries)

37:12.367 --> 37:15.067
I CAN'T DO THIS
WITHOUT MY HUSBAND.

37:16.867 --> 37:21.367
I CAN'T DO THIS ALL ALONE.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.600
AAH!

37:23.633 --> 37:26.300
OKAY, OKAY.

37:26.333 --> 37:28.200
(exhales)

37:30.233 --> 37:32.267
SO HOW ARE THEY GONNA
REMOVE THAT AMMO

37:32.300 --> 37:36.067
WITHOUT KILLING HANNAH
AND JAMES?

37:37.667 --> 37:39.133
CRISTINA.

37:39.167 --> 37:40.533
THE BOMB SQUAD GUY SAID

37:40.567 --> 37:42.467
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STAY AWAY
FROM THERE.

37:42.500 --> 37:45.633
IS IT ME
OR IS HANNAH SHAKING?

37:45.667 --> 37:48.433
IS SHE SQUEEZING
THAT AMBU BAG BY HERSELF?

37:48.467 --> 37:50.067
WHERE IS DR. MILTON?

37:53.200 --> 37:56.067
***

37:56.100 --> 37:57.833
HANNAH.

37:57.867 --> 38:00.133
***

38:00.167 --> 38:01.700
WHERE IS
THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST?

38:01.733 --> 38:03.600
HE, UM...

38:03.633 --> 38:05.567
(sighs) HE LEFT.

38:05.600 --> 38:08.467
HE DIDN'T WANT TO DIE.

38:08.500 --> 38:11.333
***

38:11.367 --> 38:13.400
HANNAH.

38:15.367 --> 38:18.833
I THINK I'M GONNA TAKE
MY HAND OUT NOW.

38:18.867 --> 38:20.433
HANNAH.

38:20.467 --> 38:23.233
WHEN THE HELL
ARE PEOPLE GONNA LEARN?
OH...

38:23.267 --> 38:25.767
IT MAY NOT BE
AS BAD AS IT SEEMS.

38:25.800 --> 38:29.067
HER HAND IS HOLDING
THAT DEVICE STEADY.

38:29.067 --> 38:31.767
OR MAYBE HER HAND IS SIMPLY
IN THERE WITH THE AMMO.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.333
WE CAN'T KNOW.

38:33.367 --> 38:35.267
YEAH, WELL, MY GUY'S
TALKED TO THE FRIEND.

38:35.300 --> 38:37.200
THAT DEVICE IS HOMEMADE,
WHICH MEANS IT'S UNSTABLE

38:37.233 --> 38:38.467
AND VERY UNRELIABLE.

38:38.500 --> 38:40.400
IT COULD BE A DUD,
BUT WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING.

38:40.433 --> 38:42.333
ADD TO THAT THE FACT
THAT YOU'VE GOT A SURGEON

38:42.367 --> 38:44.267
IN THE O.R. NEXT DOOR
REFUSING TO LEAVE

38:44.300 --> 38:46.800
AND A NERVOUS PARAMEDIC'S HAND
INSIDE THE BODY CAVITY--

38:46.833 --> 38:49.333
IT'S DEFINITELY
AS BAD AS IT SEEMS.

38:49.367 --> 38:51.300
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

38:51.333 --> 38:55.133
(Cristina) HEY, SOMEBODY! HELP!
WE NEED HELP IN HERE.

38:55.167 --> 38:57.100
(Hannah) I THINK I'M JUST GONNA
TAKE IT OUT NOW, OKAY?

38:57.133 --> 38:59.067
YOU MADE IT ALMOST
TO THE FINISH LINE.

38:59.067 --> 39:00.433
YOU CAN DO THIS.

39:00.467 --> 39:02.333
NO, NO, I JUST WANT TO TAKE
IT OUT AND BE DONE WITH IT.

39:02.367 --> 39:04.267
(Preston) HANNAH,
IT WON'T BE MUCH LONGER.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.833
REMEMBER, YOU'RE KEEPING HIM
FROM BLEEDING OUT.
NO!

39:06.867 --> 39:09.267
I AM 22 YEARS OLD.
I SHOULD NOT EVEN BE IN HERE.

39:09.300 --> 39:10.700
THIS IS SOME KIND OF MISTAKE.

39:10.733 --> 39:12.733
SHE'S PANICKING.
WE NEED TO CLEAR THE ROOM.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.667
I'M NOT LEAVING.
GREY, LET'S MOVE.

39:14.700 --> 39:17.267
I'M NOT LEAVING HER.
YOU NEED TO GET EVERYONE
OUT NOW, DR. BURKE.

39:17.300 --> 39:19.200
SHE'S MY INTERN.
I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR HER.

39:19.233 --> 39:20.833
NO, IT'S GOTTA COME OUT.
IT HAS TO COME OUT.

39:20.867 --> 39:22.800
YANG, GO WITH DYLAN.
YOU GO WITH DYLAN.

39:22.833 --> 39:24.733
HANNAH, LOOK AT ME.
NO, IT'S GOTTA COME OUT.

39:24.767 --> 39:26.667
HANNAH.
NO, NO.

39:26.700 --> 39:29.100
HANNAH, LOOK AT ME.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

39:29.133 --> 39:31.167
HANNAH, YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.
I CAN'T.

39:31.200 --> 39:34.200
YOU NEED TO RELAX, HANNAH.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.
NO!

39:34.233 --> 39:36.233
HANNAH.
(Meredith)
YOU CAN DO THIS.

39:36.267 --> 39:37.633
YOU CAN DO THIS, HANNAH.
NO, IT HAS TO COME OUT.

39:37.667 --> 39:39.767
NO, YOU KEEP IT THERE
JUST A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

39:39.800 --> 39:42.167
I HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT!
I HAVE TO! I HAVE TO!
HANNAH.

39:42.200 --> 39:43.633
I HAVE TO!

39:43.667 --> 39:46.733
***

39:57.833 --> 40:00.567
***

40:07.633 --> 40:10.600
MEREDITH.

40:12.333 --> 40:13.633
WHAT DID I DO?

40:13.667 --> 40:16.500
(Cristina)
OH, GOD, MEREDITH.

40:19.100 --> 40:21.033
JUST STAY RIGHT WHERE
YOU ARE.

40:21.067 --> 40:23.700
NOBODY MOVE.
STAY EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE.

40:23.733 --> 40:26.733
***
