(beeping)

03:53.691 --> 03:55.734
- Yes?

03:55.860 --> 03:58.403
<i>(woman): Collect call from Zoe.
Will you accept the charges?</i>

03:58.529 --> 04:00.989
- Yes, I'll... accept the charges.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.283
<i>(girl): Daddy? It's me.
How are you doing?</i>

04:03.409 --> 04:05.744
<i>- Hi! Fine.
- That's great.</i>

04:05.870 --> 04:06.870
(brushing)

04:06.996 --> 04:08.956
<i>Where are you?
What's that sound?</i>

04:09.123 --> 04:11.291
- I'm in a carwash.

04:11.417 --> 04:15.337
- Wow! I've never talked to you
when you've been in a carwash before.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.297
Îœake sure you've got
all the windows rolled up.

04:17.464 --> 04:20.341
Remember the time that...
that we were in the carwash,

04:20.468 --> 04:23.595
and I started playing
with the automatic window?

04:23.721 --> 04:26.306
How old was I, Daddy?
5 or 6?

04:26.474 --> 04:28.976
<i>I got absolutely soaked, remember?</i>

04:29.143 --> 04:30.978
- Why are you calling me, Zoe?

04:31.145 --> 04:34.022
<i>- Why am I calling you?
You're my father.</i>

04:34.440 --> 04:36.733
What, I'm not supposed to call you?

04:36.859 --> 04:39.111
What's... what's the matter with
wanting to talk to you, Daddy?

04:39.237 --> 04:41.989
- Nothing's wrong with trying
to talk to me, Zoe.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.907
<i>- Then what's the problem?</i>

04:44.033 --> 04:45.325
- The problem is...

04:47.537 --> 04:50.289
The problem is I don't know
who I'm talking to right now.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.916
- Oh, 'cause you think I'm stoned,
Daddy?

04:53.042 --> 04:56.044
Is that what you're thinking?
I've got a needle stuck in my arm?

04:56.212 --> 04:59.381
<i>Are you thinking that I've scored, Daddy,
that I'm calling you for money?</i>

04:59.549 --> 05:02.968
That I'm begging?
God, I don't fucking believe this.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.763
<i>Daddy, are you listening to me?!
Daddy!</i>

05:07.056 --> 05:08.432
Daddy!

05:11.185 --> 05:12.602
- Yes...

05:12.687 --> 05:14.604
<i>- Why can't you talk to me?</i>

05:17.984 --> 05:21.194
- Because I need to know
what state you're in, Zoe...

05:21.279 --> 05:23.947
before I know how to talk to you.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.158
(man): Come on, let's go.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.617
- Daddy!

05:28.369 --> 05:29.953
(engine starting)

05:33.750 --> 05:35.667
(distant police siren blaring)

05:38.004 --> 05:40.339
(soft country music)

05:54.604 --> 05:57.272
<i>Speak a little softer</i>

05:57.357 --> 05:59.775
<i>And wink a little louder</i>

05:59.942 --> 06:03.820
<i>And shoot less with more care</i>

06:05.323 --> 06:07.574
<i>And sing a little sweeter</i>

06:07.700 --> 06:10.535
<i>And love a little longer</i>

06:10.661 --> 06:15.582
<i>And soon you will be there</i>

06:15.708 --> 06:18.794
<i>Here</i>

06:18.920 --> 06:22.464
<i>All we have here is sky</i>

06:23.966 --> 06:28.178
<i>All the sky is
is blue</i>

06:29.764 --> 06:31.640
<i>All the blue is</i>

06:31.766 --> 06:37.020
<i>Is one more colour</i>

06:37.563 --> 06:48.448
<i>One more colour</i>

06:48.574 --> 06:51.868
<i>Now</i>

06:53.996 --> 06:55.789
- Well, that was great.
- Really?

06:55.915 --> 06:58.125
- You're gonna blow
everyone away.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.376
- You mean it?
- Of course.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.753
- You don't sound like...
completely sure.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.755
(indistinct chatter)
- I am.

07:03.881 --> 07:07.300
Really.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.762
It was awesome.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.433
(chuckling)
- I'm so happy, Daddy.

07:16.352 --> 07:18.770
(mooing)

07:19.272 --> 07:21.314
Let's get some ice cream, Daddy.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.487
(persistent honking)

07:34.495 --> 07:36.580
(dialing)

07:36.706 --> 07:38.623
<i>(ringing)</i>

07:38.749 --> 07:40.709
- Operator, can you hear me?

07:40.835 --> 07:42.335
(woman): Yes, go ahead, please.

07:42.462 --> 07:46.715
- Um... I-I seem to be
in a strange situation.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.717
I'm-I'm calling from my car.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.219
And I appear to be stuck
in a carwash.

07:51.345 --> 07:52.220
<i>- A carwash?</i>

07:52.346 --> 07:54.222
- Right. Yeah, a carwash.
Uh...

07:54.348 --> 07:57.350
<i>- Can you speak a little louder,
please, sir?</i>

07:57.435 --> 07:59.853
<i>Sorry, sir. I'm losing you again.</i>

08:00.771 --> 08:02.105
(phone beeping)

08:04.525 --> 08:05.567
(ignition signal beeping)

08:08.529 --> 08:19.873
(grunting)

08:22.293 --> 08:23.793
- Jesus...

08:25.379 --> 08:26.463
(grunting)

08:28.341 --> 08:30.800
(electro-acoustic music)

09:34.991 --> 09:36.616
<i>(children screaming)</i>

09:39.996 --> 09:42.080
(background chatter)

09:48.337 --> 09:49.671
(woman): Okay, here we are!

09:49.839 --> 09:52.215
Everybody out!

09:52.842 --> 09:55.552
Come on! Quickly now.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.847
Gather around.
Come on, everybody.

09:58.889 --> 10:02.225
Come out quickly.
We haven't got all day.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.269
Now, I want you to listen to me.
- What is it?

10:04.395 --> 10:06.479
(woman): I got a few things
I have to tell you.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.607
- Just the way Dolores gets so excited
with the kids.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.526
- Alright. Rule number 1.
- It's like the biggest thing in her life.

10:11.652 --> 10:13.945
- Don't stick your fingers
into any of the cages.

10:14.071 --> 10:17.991
Heidi, this applies to you.
And Shane, get back here, please.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.619
I don't care how cute
some of these animals may be,

10:20.745 --> 10:22.829
the fact is
they don't like being here.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.874
No matter how many ribbons
they may have won. Eh?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.417
(indistinct chatter)

10:27.543 --> 10:29.461
Rule number 2.
Hey, Sam.

10:29.587 --> 10:33.131
Hey, Nicole.
Rule number 2: no kicking,

10:33.257 --> 10:35.550
pushing, shoving or biting.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.553
Rule number 3: older kids,
you look after the younger kids.

10:38.721 --> 10:42.557
If any of you get lost, you come here
to the red lady. I will find you.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.268
Rule number 4: wiggle your noses
and have fun.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.354
(distant barking)

11:11.754 --> 11:13.838
(TV playing)

11:18.678 --> 11:20.428
(shivering)

11:27.770 --> 11:38.405
(dinging)

11:40.616 --> 11:41.950
- Hello.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.910
(toilet flushing)

11:46.330 --> 11:48.248
- Is it raining outside?

11:48.332 --> 11:51.000
- No, uh... had an accident.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.169
Do you have a room?

11:56.340 --> 11:58.675
- Will you be spending
more than a night?

11:58.843 --> 12:00.760
- Hard to say. Uh...

12:00.845 --> 12:03.346
Could have some business here-
- You a reporter?

12:10.646 --> 12:12.230
- No, sir.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.486
- You here about the accident?

12:18.612 --> 12:20.488
- Yes.

12:20.614 --> 12:22.574
I'm a lawyer.

12:23.993 --> 12:27.036
I realize this is an awful time,
but it's important that we talk.

12:29.623 --> 12:31.416
- Kyle Lansdom's a drunk.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.418
Nobody likes him.

12:33.544 --> 12:36.588
He's a nasty piece of work.
- In what way?

12:36.714 --> 12:40.216
- Well, he's been drinking since high school.
Fucked himself up.

12:41.051 --> 12:42.886
Used to be smart enough.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.596
- Any criminal record?

12:44.722 --> 12:49.976
- Probably... at least half a dozen
traffic convictions, drunk driving.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.896
Lost his licence.
That's why he don't work no more.

12:53.731 --> 12:58.276
Can't get off that... shitty dump
they live on.

12:58.986 --> 13:02.238
Whatever money does come in
goes to booze.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.574
- How does the family survive?

13:06.243 --> 13:07.577
- I dunno.

13:08.245 --> 13:09.579
Church charity...

13:09.705 --> 13:12.749
Welfare, food bank.
They scrape by.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.376
(munching)

13:16.170 --> 13:17.504
(sighing)

13:17.630 --> 13:19.631
- And, uh...

13:20.716 --> 13:23.092
What about Dora?
(woman): Doreen.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.221
She was a friend of mine.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.641
- When was that?
- At school.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.772
She fell for Kyle
just before we graduated.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.526
And... she got pregnant.

13:40.736 --> 13:43.571
Uh... moved into a... a trailer,

13:43.656 --> 13:46.908
up... on a wood lot
Kyle's dad used to own.

13:46.992 --> 13:50.620
Kyle started spending more and more time
at the Spread Eagle.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.664
- That's the local bar?

13:55.584 --> 13:58.837
- Uh... and coming home drunk,
and...

14:00.464 --> 14:03.675
feeling trapped by his life,
I guess, and...

14:04.718 --> 14:07.178
blaming her for that and...

14:07.304 --> 14:10.014
Well.
- And...?

14:10.266 --> 14:12.600
And... and...

14:12.935 --> 14:14.477
and he beat her.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.981
- He beat her?
(man): Yes!

14:18.107 --> 14:19.315
- Oh...

14:19.859 --> 14:23.486
You see... to do this right,

14:23.612 --> 14:25.196
to actually have a chance
of winning,

14:25.322 --> 14:28.658
of getting some money to compensate you
for the loss of your boy,

14:31.328 --> 14:33.288
we need folks like you.

14:33.455 --> 14:36.040
Sensitive, loving parents,

14:36.166 --> 14:38.960
with no criminal background,
no history of trouble in the town.

14:39.086 --> 14:42.255
Do you understand?
- Yes.

14:42.381 --> 14:45.383
- Now, of these people
that you've told me about

14:45.509 --> 14:48.428
whose kids were killed,

14:48.554 --> 14:51.723
who do you consider to be good,
upstanding neighbours?

14:52.600 --> 14:55.518
People who will help us
in our cause?

14:55.644 --> 14:59.272
- Uh, there's the Hamiltons.
Joe and Shelly Hamilton.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.316
(man): Oh yeah, right!

15:01.442 --> 15:02.817
(scoffing)

15:04.987 --> 15:08.114
Everybody knows that Joey

15:08.240 --> 15:11.075
steals antiques from summer cottages

15:11.243 --> 15:13.494
and sells them to dealers
in the city.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.331
He's been doing that for years.
- That's great, Wendell.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.083
That's exactly what I need to know.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.461
You see, so it won't come back
to haunt our case later on-

15:21.587 --> 15:23.796
(woman): There's the Prescotts.

15:23.923 --> 15:27.091
- Oh! You know how much money
he owes to the bank?

15:27.217 --> 15:28.635
He's about to lose his house,

15:28.761 --> 15:30.678
he's about to lose his car.
- Yeah.

15:30.804 --> 15:31.721
But Charlene, she-

15:31.847 --> 15:35.016
- Charlene is over at the Spread Eagle
every other night.

15:35.142 --> 15:38.478
She sleeps with whoever
she can get her hands on.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.271
I mean, she'd go down for a...

15:40.397 --> 15:42.565
pat on the head
and a fistful of peanuts.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.150
- Ah... Ahem!

15:50.991 --> 15:53.993
- Forget the Atwaters and the Biladows.
They're all inbred.

15:54.828 --> 15:55.870
- Oh.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.331
(woman): The Ottos.
- The...

16:02.503 --> 16:04.671
- Well, tell me about the Ottos.

16:04.755 --> 16:07.340
- Wanda and Hartley.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.842
They lost Bear.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.178
He was their adopted son.

16:14.181 --> 16:17.517
He was a beautiful boy.
He was Indian.

16:18.185 --> 16:21.521
- That's good.
Judges like adopted Indian boys.

16:21.605 --> 16:24.232
Tell me more about the Ottos.
- They're smart.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.443
They've been to college.

16:27.569 --> 16:30.321
They moved here from the city
about a dozen years ago.

16:30.447 --> 16:31.906
(man): What do they do?

16:32.032 --> 16:34.659
- Crafts.
(Wendell scoffing)

16:34.785 --> 16:35.910
(man scribbling)

16:36.036 --> 16:37.954
Wanda does these photographic things.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.958
That's one of hers.
Right here on the wall.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.212
- You know, they probably smoke weed.
- You don't know that.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.214
- They ever been busted?

16:48.340 --> 16:50.216
- No.
- You don't know!

16:50.300 --> 16:52.885
That's what it is.
You don't know.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.806
(cellphone ringing)

16:58.726 --> 17:00.685
(ringing)
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.

17:00.769 --> 17:02.770
(sighing): Yes?

17:02.896 --> 17:04.731
<i>(woman): Collect call from Zoe.
Will you accept the charges?</i>

17:04.857 --> 17:06.482
- Yes, I'll accept the charges.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.401
Do you mind if I step outside
for a moment?

17:08.527 --> 17:10.737
It's a private call.
I'm so sorry.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.156
(sighing)

17:15.117 --> 17:17.076
- Why do you say things
when you don't know...

17:17.202 --> 17:19.746
- Zoe? Where are you, darling?
(Wendell): Shut up.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.329
(woman): I won't shut up.
- Yeah...

17:21.457 --> 17:23.415
(indistinct comment)
(Wendell): Oh, shut up.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.460
- Yeah...
(Wendell): Shut up!

17:25.586 --> 17:28.463
- Yes, I am listening...
(Wendell): Shut your big, fat mouth.

17:29.840 --> 17:33.468
- Oh... no, of course I'm being sincere.
I understand what you're saying.

17:33.594 --> 17:34.927
The fact that you...
(shouting)

17:35.054 --> 17:37.889
The fact that you like the doctor,
I mean... it's half the battle...

17:38.015 --> 17:39.557
(Wendell): Shut up.
(woman): You're jealous again.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.726
- Please...
(Wendell): Shut up. I'm jealous of what?

17:41.852 --> 17:44.187
What am I jealous of?
(woman): 'Cause he's smarter than you.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.563
- Yeah...
(Wendell): Smarter than me?

17:45.689 --> 17:48.107
Oh, yeah!
Like the Ottos are smart, too.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.151
Did you hear what that man said?
He said, "Good, Wendell."

17:50.277 --> 17:52.361
Good! He said, "Good!"
- I will do it in 10 minutes.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.447
(woman): You're a big baby!
(Wendell): Shut up!

18:01.163 --> 18:04.123
(TV sound coming on and off)

18:06.168 --> 18:08.169
(erratic dialogue in headphones)

18:13.050 --> 18:14.634
(exasperated sighing)

18:16.053 --> 18:17.845
(beeping stewardess)

18:18.597 --> 18:20.098
(curtains opening)

18:21.141 --> 18:23.309
- Yes, sir?
- Oh, hi.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.311
I... I can't get any sound of out this.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.355
- Oh, here. I'll get you another pair.
- Thank you.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.527
- Here, you can have mine.

18:35.155 --> 18:38.116
Allison O'Donnell.
- Alli...

18:38.200 --> 18:40.118
- I was a friend of Zoe's.

18:40.202 --> 18:43.121
We used to go to school together.
I used to come to your house.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.707
- Yeah...
- Ally. Îœy nickname was Ally.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.335
- Ally? Right, right.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.337
- How are you?

18:52.089 --> 18:53.339
- Oh, I'm just fine.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.550
How about you?
- I'm fine.

18:55.676 --> 18:59.178
I'm... still working with my father.
- Right.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.180
Um...

19:01.348 --> 19:03.516
What does he do again?

19:03.684 --> 19:06.227
- Well, he used to work with you.
You guys used to be partners.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.229
(both chuckling)

19:08.355 --> 19:10.648
- Allison!
- Îœm-hmm.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.650
How's Îœrs. Stevens?

19:12.776 --> 19:16.279
- Well, she's just fine. She...
We're... not together anymore.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.698
- Yeah, I'd heard that. But she's well?
- Yeah.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.700
- And Zoe?

19:20.826 --> 19:22.535
How's Zoe?

19:22.661 --> 19:23.995
(curtains opening)

19:24.955 --> 19:27.665
(woman): Oh, you've beat me to it.
Here you go.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.417
- Thanks.

19:32.212 --> 19:34.297
(Stevens sighing)
(curtains closing)

19:34.423 --> 19:36.299
(soft music)

19:49.813 --> 19:52.356
(crowing)

19:53.108 --> 19:55.443
(man humming)

20:01.158 --> 20:03.534
(Dolores): 'Îœorning, Wanda!
Hey, Hartley!

20:03.660 --> 20:05.953
(Wanda): Hi, Dolores.
(Hartley): Good morning, Dolores.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.539
Beautiful snow we're having,
eh, Dolores?

20:08.707 --> 20:11.584
- Oh, it's just a flurry, Hartley.
It's totally clear up ahead.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.586
- That's good.
(Bear): Look!

20:13.837 --> 20:16.547
(Dolores): What's that you got there?
- What do you think?

20:16.673 --> 20:19.550
(Dolores): Well, it's, uh...
certainly what you call interesting.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.928
- You hate it.

20:22.262 --> 20:25.056
(Hartley laughing)
- No. No, no. I didn't say that. No.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.934
(Wanda): I could wrap it up
to protect the children.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.560
- I can just strap up on the roof, eh?

20:29.686 --> 20:31.729
(Hartley): There's an idea!
- Come on, give me a break!

20:31.855 --> 20:33.773
It's for the school bazaar.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.900
- Oh, well, it's bizarre alright.
(laughing)

20:36.026 --> 20:37.735
Come on, Bear.
Let's get you outta here.

20:37.861 --> 20:40.613
- Come on, Bear.
Away from your crazy mother.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.616
- That's right. I'll see you, Wanda.
Bye, Hartley.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.701
(Wanda): Take care.
(Hartley): So long.

20:50.123 --> 20:51.540
Bye-bye!

20:52.125 --> 20:53.876
(soft medieval music)

21:01.551 --> 21:04.637
<i>(Dolores): The Ottos always waited
for the bus with Bear.</i>

21:05.639 --> 21:08.766
<i>They were the only parents who...
who did that.</i>

21:09.685 --> 21:12.645
<i>Together, like that.</i>

21:13.814 --> 21:16.315
Uh, I guess they were
what you might call...

21:19.236 --> 21:20.486
hi... hippies.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.656
- What do you mean by that,
Îœrs. Driscoll?

21:23.865 --> 21:25.908
- Dolores.

21:26.034 --> 21:29.328
No one... ever calls me Îœrs. Driscoll.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.206
- What do you mean by that,
Dolores?

21:32.332 --> 21:34.709
- Uh, about the Ottos?
- Yes.

21:34.876 --> 21:37.503
What exactly do you mean
by hippies?

21:38.130 --> 21:39.714
(distant barking)

21:42.551 --> 21:44.552
- I... mean the way they look.

21:46.555 --> 21:49.515
<i>Their hair, and... clothing.</i>

21:51.018 --> 21:52.935
<i>(Stevens): Do they have any reputation
for drugs?</i>

21:53.061 --> 21:57.606
<i>(Dolores): Oh... no, no, no.
Nothing like that. No, uh...</i>

21:57.733 --> 21:59.942
<i>No, the Ottos...
(laughing)</i>

22:00.152 --> 22:02.778
...are what I would call...

22:02.904 --> 22:05.656
uh... model citizens.

22:05.782 --> 22:06.073
(distant barking)

22:06.199 --> 22:08.534
They're regular at town meetings.

22:08.702 --> 22:11.370
They, uh... give their opinion

22:11.580 --> 22:14.373
in a respectful way.

22:14.541 --> 22:16.375
And they, uh...

22:16.543 --> 22:20.796
they help out at various...
(Dolores inhaling)

22:21.089 --> 22:23.341
...fundraising bazaars,

22:23.467 --> 22:24.759
though they aren't...

22:27.846 --> 22:29.722
Uh...
(Dolores gulping)

22:31.391 --> 22:33.893
...church goers.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.562
- Îœm...

22:36.646 --> 22:39.398
And they love Bear?
(Dolores): Oh... yes.

22:40.442 --> 22:42.568
It's... it's like
he's their little treasure.

22:42.652 --> 22:45.237
He's such a beautiful boy...

22:45.322 --> 22:48.199
Oh, well, there's a picture of him
on the wall over there,

22:48.325 --> 22:49.533
just beside Abbott.

22:50.577 --> 22:52.078
(distant barking)

22:56.249 --> 22:59.251
Those were all taken at the fair
last year.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.796
Abbott and me, we were judges
at the pet show.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.297
- For rabbits?
(Abbott mumbling)

23:03.423 --> 23:06.384
- Abbott used to breed them
till he had the stroke.

23:06.510 --> 23:09.095
(Abbott mumbling)
Bear won 1 st prize.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.597
Just look at the smile on his face.

23:13.558 --> 23:16.977
He's one of those children who...
who bring out the best in people.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.399
(distant barking)

23:23.527 --> 23:25.778
He would've made a wonderful man.

23:34.704 --> 23:37.164
(music): Watch the band

23:39.209 --> 23:42.962
<i>Through a bunch of dancers</i>

23:45.048 --> 23:48.050
<i>Quickly</i>

23:49.469 --> 23:53.055
<i>Follow the unknown</i>

23:55.475 --> 23:58.477
<i>With something</i>

24:00.480 --> 24:03.899
<i>More familiar</i>

24:06.278 --> 24:08.904
<i>Quickly</i>

24:10.490 --> 24:14.201
<i>Something familiar</i>

24:17.914 --> 24:19.415
<i>Courage...</i>

24:19.541 --> 24:22.501
<i>(Dolores): Billy Ansel
started honking at us</i>

24:22.627 --> 24:24.503
<i>up around Upperhat Creek.</i>

24:24.629 --> 24:26.881
<i>(honking)
He always started to do that</i>

24:27.174 --> 24:28.883
<i>when he caught up to the bus.</i>

24:29.009 --> 24:32.553
<i>He'd wave at his kids,
Jessica and Mason.</i>

24:32.679 --> 24:35.556
<i>They... always sat in the back.</i>

24:36.683 --> 24:39.226
<i>Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.
(honking)</i>

24:41.188 --> 24:44.148
<i>Normally, he'd follow us
the whole distance</i>

24:44.232 --> 24:47.151
<i>past the bridge,
towards the school.</i>

24:47.235 --> 24:50.529
<i>(Stevens): Are you saying that Billy
was driving behind the bus</i>

24:50.655 --> 24:53.657
<i>at the time of the accident?
(Dolores): Yeah.</i>

24:53.742 --> 24:55.576
It...

24:57.662 --> 25:01.540
uh... comforted him.
- From what?

25:01.708 --> 25:04.877
- From what?
(distant barking)

25:05.003 --> 25:07.087
- I'll get the tray.
- Oh, thank you.

25:07.214 --> 25:10.508
- Did he have any, uh...
particular problems that you knew of?

25:10.634 --> 25:13.511
Financial pressures,
run-ins with the law that...

25:13.637 --> 25:15.513
You go ahead.
- No!

25:15.639 --> 25:17.932
No, no, no.

25:18.558 --> 25:20.392
No. No, no, no.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.478
Nothing like that.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.563
No.
(distant barking)

25:25.106 --> 25:29.109
Billy's wife, Lydia -
God rest her -

25:29.236 --> 25:33.113
she died of cancer
a few years back.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.115
Ah... she was a wonderful woman.

25:35.242 --> 25:37.576
Great mom.
(TV playing)

25:37.702 --> 25:41.121
Warm, lovin'.

25:41.248 --> 25:43.123
She had a beautiful voice.

25:43.250 --> 25:47.211
She used to sing in the...
church choir.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.046
(softly grunting)

25:49.172 --> 25:51.215
Anyway.

25:51.967 --> 25:54.093
(grunting)

25:54.219 --> 25:57.096
Billy took over raising the kids
by himself.

25:58.598 --> 26:00.724
It was obvious
how much he missed Lydia.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.940
(dialing)

26:10.402 --> 26:12.611
(phone ringing)

26:13.613 --> 26:15.447
(ringing)
- Hello?

26:15.615 --> 26:17.366
(Billy): Hey, Risa.
- Hi.

26:17.492 --> 26:19.118
<i>- Can you talk?</i>

26:19.286 --> 26:21.996
- Uh, yeah. Where are ya?

26:22.330 --> 26:24.999
<i>- I was on my way to work.
- Do you see the kids?</i>

26:25.125 --> 26:27.001
- Yeah, I'm wavin' at 'em right now.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.461
<i>(clanging)
What's that noise?</i>

26:29.588 --> 26:32.464
- It's Wendell. He's up on the roof.
He thinks he's fixing a leak.

26:32.632 --> 26:36.135
Ha! Ha! As far as I'm concerned,
he's just punching in a few new holes.

26:36.261 --> 26:39.221
(laughing)
- Hey, listen.

26:39.347 --> 26:42.224
Nicole's comin' over to look after the kids
tonight. She'll be there at around 6.

26:42.350 --> 26:45.477
<i>- Oh, Billy, that's too early.
- She says she's gotta be home by 9, so...</i>

26:45.645 --> 26:48.564
<i>- Yeah, can't you make it later?
- Well, alright, well...</i>

26:48.690 --> 26:52.151
Well, just... I'll be waitin' in the room
and, uh...

26:52.319 --> 26:54.278
you just get over
as soon as you can, okay?

26:54.404 --> 26:56.780
- Okay, I guess.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.700
- Alright, sexy.

26:59.826 --> 27:01.285
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

27:04.205 --> 27:05.539
(soft music)

27:23.516 --> 27:25.517
- Thanks.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.020
- Îœm-hmm.

27:30.523 --> 27:33.108
- I'm glad to hear
that Zoe's alright.

27:33.193 --> 27:35.110
(woman): You're welcome.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.529
- Are you still in touch?

27:37.697 --> 27:40.115
- Not really.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.368
The last time I saw her

27:42.535 --> 27:45.537
was when she was at that clinic;
that was a long time ago.

27:45.622 --> 27:48.374
- Which one?
- Which one?

27:48.458 --> 27:50.542
- Which clinic?

27:52.545 --> 27:56.715
- I don't remember the name.
It was... near a beach.

27:56.841 --> 27:58.509
(background chatter)

27:58.635 --> 28:00.552
- Sunny Ridge...

28:03.181 --> 28:05.516
Yes, that was a long time ago.

28:06.434 --> 28:08.227
(plane motor humming)

28:08.353 --> 28:10.062
- So there were others?

28:10.188 --> 28:12.147
- Other clinics? Oh, sure.

28:14.109 --> 28:17.528
Clinics, halfway houses,
treatment centres, detox units...

28:19.489 --> 28:22.449
- So when did she get better?

28:22.575 --> 28:25.160
(inhaling): She... didn't.

28:27.122 --> 28:29.123
- Oh, I thought you said-
- That's why I'm going to see her now.

28:31.459 --> 28:34.044
- She's in trouble?

28:34.170 --> 28:35.754
(utensils clattering)

28:36.506 --> 28:40.884
- Yes. You find there's...
something strange about this meat?

28:41.010 --> 28:43.470
Uh, excuse me.
- Some more wine?

28:43.596 --> 28:46.098
- No, I think this meat's
a little overdone for me.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.475
- Oh, I'm sorry, Îœr. Stevens.
Would you like to try the fish plate?

28:48.601 --> 28:51.145
- What is it?
- Poached salmon.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.605
- Do-do you have a cold plate?
- We do.

28:53.773 --> 28:55.149
- Is there shrimp on it?
- Yes.

28:55.275 --> 28:57.234
- Well, if you take the shrimp off,

28:57.360 --> 28:59.945
as well as anything else
that touches the shrimp, I'd be grateful.

29:00.071 --> 29:02.489
- I'm not sure that's gonna leave much
on the plate.

29:02.615 --> 29:04.450
- Well, let's just see what we get,
shall we?

29:04.576 --> 29:06.243
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

29:06.369 --> 29:07.995
Will you excuse me a minute?

29:08.121 --> 29:10.581
- Îœm.
(utensils clattering)

29:18.214 --> 29:20.340
(soft medieval music)

29:35.690 --> 29:37.691
(birds chirping)

29:46.367 --> 30:05.844
(cawing)

30:28.660 --> 30:39.878
(knocking)

30:42.590 --> 30:44.550
- Îœrs. Otto?

30:44.634 --> 30:46.718
Îœy name is Îœitchell Stevens.
The Walkers told me

30:46.845 --> 30:48.846
that you might be willing
to talk to me.

30:48.972 --> 30:52.599
I'm really sorry to come over
unannounced like this.

30:52.725 --> 30:54.601
But the Walkers said
that you'd understand.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.688
I know it's an awful time...

30:57.772 --> 31:00.607
but it is important
that we talk.

31:02.026 --> 31:03.443
- Who are you?

31:03.611 --> 31:06.113
- I'm a lawyer.

31:06.364 --> 31:08.532
- Oh... look, I'm sorry.
You can't come in here.

31:08.658 --> 31:10.534
- Please, let me explain.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.287
I- I'll only take a moment
of your time.

31:13.413 --> 31:15.372
Please.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.467
(soft medieval music)

31:33.558 --> 31:35.601
(Wanda): Hartley...

31:38.187 --> 31:40.230
We have a guest.

31:45.194 --> 31:48.614
What did you say your name was?
- Uh, Îœitchell Stevens.

31:55.663 --> 31:58.123
- The Walkers sent him by.

32:17.518 --> 32:20.187
- Would you like a cup of tea
or something?

32:22.148 --> 32:24.191
- A cup of tea would be nice.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.038
(kettle whistling)

32:46.172 --> 32:48.548
Alright if sit down
for a few minutes, Îœrs. Otto?

32:48.675 --> 32:50.342
I wanna talk to you.

32:54.430 --> 32:56.598
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.

32:56.724 --> 32:58.684
- You've been retained?

33:00.561 --> 33:02.104
- Yes.

33:03.272 --> 33:05.524
- Their child died
and they got a lawyer?

33:05.900 --> 33:08.944
- It should be said that my task
is to represent the Walkers

33:09.070 --> 33:11.530
only in their anger,
not their grief.

33:11.906 --> 33:13.532
- Who did they get for that?!

33:15.952 --> 33:17.619
- You're angry, aren't you,
Îœrs. Otto?

33:20.540 --> 33:22.541
That's why I'm here.

33:22.625 --> 33:25.127
To give your anger a voice.

33:26.087 --> 33:31.133
To be your weapon against whoever...
caused that bus to go off the road.

33:31.217 --> 33:33.135
- Dolores?

33:33.428 --> 33:37.180
- It's my belief that Dolores was doing
exactly what she's done for years.

33:38.224 --> 33:41.143
Besides, the school board's insurance
on Dolores was minimal:

33:41.227 --> 33:44.146
a few million at most.

33:44.230 --> 33:46.565
No, the really deep pockets
are in the town.

33:46.691 --> 33:49.151
Or the company that made the bus.

33:49.235 --> 33:52.154
- So you think someone else
caused the accident, Îœr. Stevens?

33:52.238 --> 33:56.324
- Îœrs. Otto, there is no such thing
as an accident.

33:58.661 --> 34:00.537
The word doesn't mean anything to me.

34:00.830 --> 34:03.540
As far as I'm concerned,

34:03.666 --> 34:06.293
somebody, somewhere...

34:06.419 --> 34:08.920
made a decision to cut a corner.

34:09.213 --> 34:12.674
Some corrupt agency or corporation

34:13.676 --> 34:17.137
accounted the cost variance
between a 10-cent bolt

34:17.388 --> 34:20.556
and a million-dollar
out-of-court settlement.

34:24.145 --> 34:28.607
And they decided to sacrifice
a few lives for the difference.

34:28.733 --> 34:31.109
That's what's done, Îœrs. Otto.

34:31.235 --> 34:34.237
I've seen it happen
so many times before.

34:34.489 --> 34:35.989
(Hartley): But Dolores said...

34:36.324 --> 34:38.116
she hit a patch of ice,

34:38.242 --> 34:40.494
and lost control of the bus.

34:40.620 --> 34:43.496
- Yeah... Îœr. Otto, how long has Dolores
been driving that bus?

34:43.623 --> 34:46.123
How many times
has she steered clear of danger?

34:46.250 --> 34:48.918
I mean, what happened that morning?

34:49.045 --> 34:50.629
Thank you.

34:55.176 --> 35:00.222
Somebody calculated ahead of time
what it would cost to sacrifice safety.

35:00.348 --> 35:04.142
It's... the darkest, most cynical thing
you could imagine,

35:04.268 --> 35:07.104
but it's absolutely true.

35:07.188 --> 35:09.106
And now,

35:10.024 --> 35:14.611
it's up to me to ensure
moral responsibility in this society.

35:14.904 --> 35:16.988
- So you're just the thing we need.

35:18.783 --> 35:22.494
Isn't that you want us
to believe, Îœr. Stevens?

35:22.620 --> 35:25.831
That you know what's best for us?

35:26.791 --> 35:28.083
- Ahem...

35:32.547 --> 35:35.632
Now, you listen to me, Îœrs. Otto.

35:38.177 --> 35:40.220
And you listen very carefully.

35:42.181 --> 35:45.142
I do know what's best,
believe me.

35:45.226 --> 35:47.144
As we're sitting here, talking,

35:48.604 --> 35:52.149
the town...
or the school board

35:52.233 --> 35:55.193
or the manufacturer of that bus

35:55.319 --> 35:58.655
are lining up a battery
of their own lawyers

35:58.698 --> 36:02.159
to negotiate with people
as grief-stricken as yourselves.

36:02.243 --> 36:04.870
And that makes me very, very mad.

36:04.996 --> 36:08.498
That's why I came
all the way up here.

36:08.624 --> 36:11.751
If everyone had done their job
with integrity,

36:11.878 --> 36:13.753
your son would be alive

36:14.088 --> 36:15.839
and safely in school this morning.

36:16.632 --> 36:17.966
(sobbing)

36:18.092 --> 36:22.846
I promise... that I will pursue
and reveal

36:22.972 --> 36:26.641
who it was
did not do their job.

36:26.767 --> 36:27.976
(Wanda sobbing)

36:28.102 --> 36:30.520
Who is responsible for this...

36:31.272 --> 36:32.731
tragedy.

36:34.692 --> 36:37.360
And then, in your name,
the Walkers' name,

36:37.486 --> 36:40.197
in-in the name
of whoever decides to join us,

36:41.657 --> 36:43.158
I will sue...

36:43.701 --> 36:47.913
I will sue for negligence
until they bleed.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.916
- I want that...
that person to go to jail...

36:51.042 --> 36:53.543
for the rest of his life.

36:53.628 --> 36:56.213
(sobbing)
I want him...

36:56.339 --> 36:59.466
I want him... to die there.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.511
I don't want his money.

37:04.889 --> 37:07.432
- It's unlikely that anyone
will go to prison, Îœrs. Otto.

37:07.600 --> 37:12.187
But he or his company
will pay in other ways.

37:13.272 --> 37:15.440
And we must make them pay.

37:15.608 --> 37:18.693
Not for the money or the... compensation
for the loss of your boy.

37:18.819 --> 37:20.028
That can't be done.

37:20.863 --> 37:23.323
(Wanda sobbing)
(fire crackling)

37:23.449 --> 37:25.951
But for the protection
of other innocent children.

37:28.120 --> 37:33.124
You see, I'm not just here
to speak for your anger...

37:33.334 --> 37:35.794
but for the future as well.

37:44.136 --> 37:46.638
- Are you expensive?

37:51.519 --> 37:53.186
- No.

37:55.648 --> 37:59.150
If you agree to have me
represent you in this suit,

37:59.235 --> 38:02.529
I will require no payment
until the case is won,

38:02.655 --> 38:06.825
when I will require one third
of the awarded amount.

38:07.201 --> 38:09.494
If no award is made,

38:09.578 --> 38:13.081
then my services to you
will cost you absolutely nothing.

38:13.165 --> 38:15.083
This is... standard agreement.

38:15.167 --> 38:17.168
- Do you have this agreement with you?

38:17.378 --> 38:20.505
- Yes, I do. It's in my car.

38:24.385 --> 38:26.344
I won't be a minute.

38:26.429 --> 38:28.430
Uh... in any case,

38:28.514 --> 38:32.309
you should have time to discuss this
without me before you make a decision.

38:35.396 --> 38:37.439
(soft oriental music)

38:46.532 --> 38:48.783
<i>(Stevens): I did everything a loving father</i>

38:48.868 --> 38:50.869
<i>of a drug addict is supposed to do.</i>

38:51.037 --> 38:53.038
<i>I sent her to the best hospitals.</i>

38:53.164 --> 38:54.998
She saw the best doctors.

38:55.124 --> 38:57.542
No matter, two weeks later,
she'd be out on the street.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.502
And next time I saw her,

38:59.628 --> 39:03.506
a phone call
is coming for money.

39:03.632 --> 39:05.425
Îœoney for school,
money for some new kind of therapist.

39:05.551 --> 39:07.635
Or... money for a plane ticket home.

39:07.762 --> 39:11.431
"Oh, Daddy, please,
let me come home. I need to see you."

39:11.557 --> 39:13.433
But she never came home.

39:13.559 --> 39:17.145
I was always at the airport,
but she was never there.

39:19.023 --> 39:20.357
(sipping, gulping)

39:20.483 --> 39:24.069
Had 10 years of this.
10 years of lies.

39:24.195 --> 39:27.447
I wondered what would happen
if I didn't send the money.

39:27.573 --> 39:30.325
Kicking down doors...

39:30.451 --> 39:34.871
dragging her out
of rat-infested apartments.

39:34.997 --> 39:37.916
Explaining to somebody
that couldn't possibly be my daughter

39:38.042 --> 39:40.460
that they saw in a porn flick!

39:41.587 --> 39:43.171
Oh...

39:46.509 --> 39:50.553
Enough rage and helplessness
and your love turns to something else.

39:54.517 --> 39:56.559
- What does it turn to?

40:01.524 --> 40:03.566
- It turns to steaming piss.

40:09.031 --> 40:10.573
- Hello!

40:11.617 --> 40:13.743
(children shouting)

40:16.163 --> 40:18.123
- Hi, Nicole.
- Hi.

40:18.249 --> 40:18.832
- They just had supper. Okay?

40:18.958 --> 40:22.127
- Yeah? Was it good?
- Alright, you be good.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.129
- Yuk!
- Was it good? Of course it was good.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.922
I'll be back before 9, okay?

40:26.048 --> 40:27.549
- Okay. That's good. Bye!
- Bye.

40:27.675 --> 40:29.592
- Oh...
- Let's go!

40:32.763 --> 40:34.931
(electric guitar)

40:57.204 --> 40:59.164
(distant train)

41:32.698 --> 41:34.324
(vehicle passing by)

41:37.119 --> 41:38.620
(sighing)

41:41.415 --> 41:43.541
- Hey.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.543
- Are you waiting long?

41:45.669 --> 41:49.047
- A while.
- Billy, do you have to smoke?

41:49.173 --> 41:51.257
Wendell can smell it
if someone's been smoking.

41:58.682 --> 42:00.183
- What's all this?

42:00.267 --> 42:03.436
- Wendell put some fresh enamel
on that break in the tub.

42:03.562 --> 42:06.105
- Does it mean I can't have a shower?

42:06.232 --> 42:08.525
- No, should be dry by now.

42:08.651 --> 42:11.528
(laughter)

42:11.654 --> 42:13.530
- When's he getting back?

42:13.656 --> 42:15.532
- After the game, I guess.

42:15.658 --> 42:17.575
- Oh, the game.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.580
- Oh! Hey!
(TV playing)

42:28.045 --> 42:31.422
(Nicole): The Pied Piper of Hamelin.

42:31.549 --> 42:35.426
"Hamelin town's in Brunswick,
by famous Hanover city.

42:35.636 --> 42:40.390
"The river Weser, deep and wide,
washes its wall on the southern side.

42:40.516 --> 42:43.142
"A pleasanter spot you never spied.

42:43.269 --> 42:46.145
"But when begins my ditty-"
- What's a ditty again?

42:46.272 --> 42:49.566
- Um, it's a... it's like a song.
- Oh.

42:49.692 --> 42:51.901
- "Almost 500 years ago,

42:52.027 --> 42:55.071
"to see the townsfolk suffer so
from vermin was a pity."

42:55.197 --> 42:56.614
- What's vermin again?

42:56.740 --> 42:58.533
- Rats.
- Oh.

42:58.659 --> 43:00.535
- Um! "They fought the dogs
and killed the cats,

43:00.661 --> 43:02.537
"and bit the babies in the cradles,

43:02.663 --> 43:05.456
"and ate the cheeses
out of the vats.

43:05.624 --> 43:07.458
"and licked the soup
from the cooks' own ladles.

43:07.626 --> 43:11.296
(children laughing)
"Spit open the kegs of salted sprats.

43:11.547 --> 43:14.132
"Îœade nests inside men's
Sunday hats.

43:14.300 --> 43:16.759
"And even spoiled the women's chats

43:16.885 --> 43:20.054
"by drowning their speaking
with shrieking and squeaking,

43:20.180 --> 43:21.514
"in 50 different sharps and flats."

43:21.640 --> 43:23.474
- Nicole?
- Yes, Îœason?

43:23.642 --> 43:25.852
- Can I sit beside you
on the bus tomorrow?

43:26.186 --> 43:29.063
- Well, I thought usually you like to sit
at the back to wave at your dad?

43:29.189 --> 43:30.815
- I wanna sit beside you tomorrow.

43:31.191 --> 43:32.817
(chuckling)
- Okay.

43:32.985 --> 43:35.862
- Nicole?
- Îœm-hmm?

43:35.988 --> 43:37.947
- Did the Pied Piper
take the children away

43:38.073 --> 43:40.325
because he was mad the town
didn't pay him?

43:40.451 --> 43:42.869
- That's right.
- Well...

43:42.995 --> 43:44.996
if he knew magic,

43:45.122 --> 43:46.831
if he could get the kids
into the mountain,

43:46.874 --> 43:49.834
why couldn't he use his magic pipe

43:49.877 --> 43:53.379
to make the people pay him
for getting rid of the rats?

43:53.547 --> 43:55.673
- Um, because, uh...

43:56.383 --> 43:57.634
(distant barking)

43:57.760 --> 43:59.927
He-he wanted them
to be punished.

44:00.220 --> 44:02.180
- So he was mean?

44:02.264 --> 44:04.515
- No. Not mean, just...

44:04.725 --> 44:06.517
just very...

44:09.521 --> 44:11.522
very angry.

44:12.691 --> 44:14.525
(clock ticking)
- Oh...

44:14.693 --> 44:18.613
- Should... should I keep reading?
(Îœanson): Yeah.

44:21.408 --> 44:23.826
(soft music)

44:24.870 --> 44:26.579
(Billy softly moaning)

44:26.705 --> 44:31.751
(music): I watch you watch me

44:33.087 --> 44:38.341
<i>Take two steps at a time
through the dark</i>

44:42.638 --> 44:44.889
<i>Afternoon</i>

44:45.641 --> 44:46.974
(Billy softly sighing)

44:47.101 --> 44:52.980
<i>Two steps at a time
like there's something to chase</i>

44:53.732 --> 44:58.444
<i>Peace withering away
down the dog</i>

45:00.280 --> 45:03.533
<i>Track drizzle</i>

45:08.163 --> 45:12.792
<i>Morning glows faintly
at the edges in you</i>

45:14.211 --> 45:18.256
<i>There's too much light to see</i>

45:19.508 --> 45:21.551
(Billy): What are you thinking?

45:23.178 --> 45:26.055
<i>...Useless to talk to</i>

45:26.181 --> 45:29.517
<i>I was talking...</i>

45:36.525 --> 45:40.403
- Tomorrow, I'm gonna put Sean
on the bus, and he won't wanna go.

45:42.531 --> 45:44.574
He never does.

45:46.535 --> 45:48.077
He'll cry.

45:48.203 --> 45:49.495
(Billy getting dressed.)

45:49.621 --> 45:51.914
He won't wanna let go of me.

45:52.166 --> 45:54.709
- Well... it's 'cause he misses you.

45:56.628 --> 45:58.755
- Yes.

45:58.881 --> 46:01.632
(sighing)
- It's natural.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.509
- Your kids never cry?

46:03.635 --> 46:05.845
- Well, it's probably 'cause they know
I'll be following 'em

46:06.180 --> 46:08.473
behind the bus.

46:08.599 --> 46:10.933
- They can look forward to that.

46:11.018 --> 46:12.852
- Yeah.

46:13.187 --> 46:16.105
- Just like we look forward to this.

46:16.982 --> 46:18.357
- Ye... yeah.

46:26.074 --> 46:29.494
(kissing sound)
- You're leaving?

46:29.620 --> 46:31.871
- Yeah,

46:32.164 --> 46:34.707
I'd better... get back.
Like I said, Nicole...

46:34.833 --> 46:36.793
has to be home by...

46:39.713 --> 46:41.672
- Good night, Billy.

46:41.882 --> 46:43.549
- 'Night, Risa.

46:47.387 --> 46:49.347
- Are-are you sure?

46:51.308 --> 46:53.267
- Yeah.

46:53.393 --> 46:56.604
- It-it just seems...

46:56.730 --> 46:58.523
kind of... weird.

46:59.900 --> 47:02.318
- Why?

47:03.445 --> 47:04.987
(sighing)
- Listen, Nicole.

47:05.113 --> 47:07.323
You know, I'm just gonna take this stuff
and pack it,

47:07.449 --> 47:09.075
give it to the church for charity.

47:09.201 --> 47:11.077
I mean, don't... don't feel bad.

47:11.203 --> 47:13.871
Unless you feel strange about wearing it-
- No.

47:13.997 --> 47:16.874
No, I... I mean, I...

47:17.000 --> 47:20.670
I remember Îœrs. Ansel wearing
some of this stuff, but... um...

47:21.296 --> 47:23.047
I don't feel weird about that.
- Okay.

47:24.508 --> 47:26.175
- I really liked her.

47:29.096 --> 47:30.555
- Well, she really liked you.

47:30.764 --> 47:33.933
And I think she probably
would've given you that stuff herself

47:34.268 --> 47:36.185
if she hadn't outgrown it or...

47:38.814 --> 47:40.982
- What do you mean,
out... out grown it?

47:42.985 --> 47:44.735
- Uh, I...
(sighing)

47:46.864 --> 47:48.573
I'm not sure.

47:51.660 --> 47:52.660

47:52.786 --> 47:56.330
Hey, uh... I ran through that... tune
you guys are working on.

47:56.456 --> 47:57.582
Came up with a couple of ideas, so...

47:57.708 --> 47:59.959
show it to the guys,
see what they say.

48:00.043 --> 48:02.086
- Oh, that's great. Thank you.
- Okay.

That's the way
I thought of them sometimes.

52:18.468 --> 52:21.762
- Like berries.
(Dolores): Yeah. Like I was...

52:21.888 --> 52:25.141
putting 'em into my big basket,

52:25.225 --> 52:27.184
clearing the hillside

Sean, he has some kind

52:47.664 --> 52:51.542
Well, he's behind the rest of...
the kids his age in school,

52:51.668 --> 52:55.212
and... like, he's too...

52:55.338 --> 52:57.882
nervous to play sports.

52:58.049 --> 53:01.552
Strange little guy.
(distant barking)

53:01.720 --> 53:03.596
But, you know,
you couldn't help but like him, eh?

53:05.015 --> 53:07.391
(children shouting)

53:07.517 --> 53:10.102
- 'Îœorning, Dolores.
- Hi, Risa.

53:10.228 --> 53:12.521
Aren't your feet freezin'?

53:12.647 --> 53:14.440
- I guess they are.

53:14.566 --> 53:17.109
(Dolores chuckling)
- I wanna stay with you.

53:17.235 --> 53:19.111
- Ah, Sean...

53:19.237 --> 53:21.113
Go on, honey. Go on.

53:21.239 --> 53:24.200

Sit next to me.

53:24.326 --> 53:26.202

53:28.705 --> 53:30.581

(Risa): I dunno.

53:30.707 --> 53:32.666
(Dolores): Temperature?

53:32.792 --> 53:35.211
- No, he's not sick or anything.

53:35.337 --> 53:37.880
Just one of those mornings,
I guess.

53:38.006 --> 53:39.840
You know...
(flasher blinking)

53:42.636 --> 53:47.556
- Well, I never had...
those mornings myself.

53:47.682 --> 53:50.601
Not so long as I had my school bus
to drive.

53:53.188 --> 53:56.482
Not so long as I had my ki... kids.

54:42.487 --> 54:44.405
(Dolores): You okay there, Sean?

54:44.531 --> 54:46.949
Looking forward to school?

54:47.075 --> 54:48.993
Now, you settle down back there!

54:49.160 --> 54:52.997
Told ya, you'll be walking to school
if you're not careful.

54:53.748 --> 54:54.915
(chuckling)

54:55.041 --> 54:57.001
Don't want that.

54:57.168 --> 54:59.920
It's a cold day out there.
Eh, Bear?

<i>(Stevens): You know, every time I come
in of one these flights to rescue Zoe,</i>

56:25.215 --> 56:28.884
<i>I remember the summer
we almost lost her.</i>

56:29.010 --> 56:31.095
<i>She was 3 years old.</i>

56:31.221 --> 56:35.474
<i>Happened one morning at this...
cottage we used to rent.</i>

56:37.560 --> 56:40.270
<i>We were all together
sleeping in bed.</i>

56:41.856 --> 56:43.774
It was a wonderful time
in our lives.

56:45.735 --> 56:48.737
We still felt we had a future together,
the three of us.

56:50.740 --> 56:52.574
(scoffing)

56:54.619 --> 56:58.580
Did you ever visit that cottage?
- I don't think so.

57:02.585 --> 57:05.087
- I remember, I was...

57:05.171 --> 57:09.800
awaken by the sound of Zoe's breathing.
It was late, but...

57:09.926 --> 57:13.262
I looked across and noticed that...
she was sweating.

57:13.346 --> 57:15.973
And all swollen, I...

57:17.934 --> 57:20.185
I grabbed her and rushed
in the kitchen,

57:20.311 --> 57:23.522
splashed some water on her face.
- What happened?

57:23.648 --> 57:26.817
- I didn't know,
I- I-I was in a complete panic.

57:26.943 --> 57:29.486
I guessed she'd been bitten
by some insect, I...

57:29.612 --> 57:31.697
But there was no doctor.

57:31.823 --> 57:34.533
The nearest hospital
was 40 miles away, and...

57:34.659 --> 57:37.786
And she was continuing to swell up.
I mean...

57:39.956 --> 57:42.541
(sighing)
Klara took her in her arms,

57:42.667 --> 57:46.503
and tried to breastfeed her
while I dialed the hospital, and...

57:46.629 --> 57:49.339
I finally got a doctor.

57:49.466 --> 57:51.216
(sobbing)

57:51.342 --> 57:54.636
<i>He surmised that there was a nest</i>

57:54.721 --> 57:58.098
<i>of baby black widow spiders
in the mattress.</i>

57:58.725 --> 58:00.517
<i>He said they had to be babies</i>

58:00.643 --> 58:03.145
<i>or else with Zoe's body weight,
she'd be dead.</i>

58:03.229 --> 58:05.731
<i>He said I had to rush her
to the hospital.</i>

58:05.857 --> 58:07.024
<i>He said, "Mr. Stevens,</i>

58:07.150 --> 58:10.486
<i>"there's a good chance you will get her here
before her throat closes.</i>

58:10.612 --> 58:13.530
<i>"But it's very important
that you keep her calm."</i>

58:13.656 --> 58:15.782
<i>Then he asked
if there was one of us</i>

58:15.909 --> 58:17.493
<i>that she was more relaxed with
than the other,</i>

58:17.619 --> 58:21.872
<i>and I said: "Yes, me,"
which was true enough, because...</i>

58:21.998 --> 58:24.666
at that particular moment,
Klara's eyes were all...

58:24.792 --> 58:29.505
wild with fear and...
the fear was contagious.

58:33.468 --> 58:35.552
I was a better actor,
that's all.

58:39.140 --> 58:42.100
And Zoe...

58:42.227 --> 58:44.186
loved us equally then.

58:48.525 --> 58:52.194
Just as she hates us
both equally now.

58:56.616 --> 59:00.494
Anyway, the doctor said
that I-I... had to hold her on my lap,

59:00.620 --> 59:04.122
and let Klara drive to the hospital.

59:04.290 --> 59:07.084
He asked me to bring a small,
sharp knife.

59:07.252 --> 59:09.086
He said it had to be clean.

59:09.254 --> 59:12.506
There was no...
time to sterilize properly.

59:13.967 --> 59:17.594
He explained how to perform
an emergency tracheotomy.

59:20.473 --> 59:23.100
How to cut into her throat,
in her windpipe,

59:23.226 --> 59:25.769
without causing her to bleed to death.
He said there would be a lot of blood.

59:25.895 --> 59:28.146
I said I didn't think I could do it,
he said...

59:28.273 --> 59:30.482
He said, "Îœr. Stevens...

59:32.443 --> 59:34.278
"if her throat closes up

59:34.404 --> 59:36.363
"and the breathing stops,
you're gonna have to.

59:36.489 --> 59:39.366
"You will have about 1 minute
and a half, possibly 2 minutes,

59:39.492 --> 59:42.160
"since she'll probably unconscious
when you do it.

59:44.122 --> 59:48.125
"But if you manage to keep her calm
and relaxed...

59:48.251 --> 59:50.252
(gulping)

59:52.297 --> 59:55.507
"...and not let her little heart
beat too fast,

59:57.885 --> 01:00:01.471
"uh... and spread the poison around,

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.141
"you might just make it here first.

01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:07.811
"Now you get going," he said.
And he hung up.

01:00:14.902 --> 01:00:16.987
<i>It was an unforgettable drive.</i>

01:00:21.826 --> 01:00:24.494
<i>I was... divided into two parts.</i>

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:27.706
<i>One part was daddy...</i>

01:00:27.832 --> 01:00:29.916
<i>singing a lullaby to his little girl,</i>

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:31.835
and the other part was...

<i>(humming)</i>

01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:39.217
...surgeon with a knife,
ready to cut into her throat.

01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:46.391
I waited for the second
Zoe's breath stopped

01:00:46.517 --> 01:00:48.060
to make the incision.

01:00:50.563 --> 01:00:52.689
- What happened?

01:00:56.694 --> 01:00:58.612
- Îœm?
- What happened?

01:01:00.573 --> 01:01:05.118
- Oh, nothing.
- But...

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:08.121
- We... got to the hospital in time.

01:01:08.247 --> 01:01:09.373
(sighing)

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:13.210
I did not have to go as far
as I was prepared to go.

01:01:16.547 --> 01:01:19.549
But I was prepared
to go all the way.

01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:33.271
<i>(singing softly): Hush little baby

01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:48.114
Are you going to the funeral?

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:51.117
- I stopped by the station
a while ago and, uh...

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:53.245
I stared at the bus.

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:57.582
Almost heard the kids inside.

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:04.506
There was a lawyer there
who said, uh...

01:04:04.632 --> 01:04:06.508
gotten you signed up;
is that true?

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:08.510
- Something made this happen, Billy,

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:10.428
and Îœr. Stevens said he's gonna find out-

01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:13.515
- What are you talkin' about, Risa?
It was an accident.

01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:15.517
- Îœr. Stevens said that someone put
a wrong bolt on the bus.

01:04:15.643 --> 01:04:19.312
- I serviced the bus, Risa,
at the garage.

01:04:19.438 --> 01:04:20.522
There was nothing wrong with it.

01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:24.109
- Or that the guardrail
wasn't strong enough.

01:04:24.902 --> 01:04:25.986
- You believe that?

01:04:26.654 --> 01:04:28.572
(softly): I have to.

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:31.449
(scoffing)

01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:33.577
- Why?
- Because I have to.

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:38.582
- Well, I don't.

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:42.878
- Is it true you gave Nicole

01:04:43.004 --> 01:04:46.548
one of Lydia's sweaters?

01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:50.552
And she was wearing it
when the bus crashed?

01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:52.596
- Yeah.

01:04:55.641 --> 01:04:58.184
- Why d'you do that, Billy?

01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:01.563
- What, you think that caused
the accident, Risa?

01:05:01.689 --> 01:05:03.815
That it brought bad luck?

01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:08.945
Christ... it sounds like you're looking
for a witchdoctor, not a lawyer.

01:05:09.196 --> 01:05:10.989
Îœaybe they're the same thing.

01:05:15.453 --> 01:05:17.495
You know what I'm gonna miss?

01:05:19.123 --> 01:05:20.373
Îœore than making love?

01:05:20.499 --> 01:05:23.168
It's the nights you couldn't get away
from Wendell.

01:05:25.504 --> 01:05:27.964
Nights I'd just sit in that chair
for an hour.

01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:33.303
Smoking a cigarette,
remembering my life before.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.517
(door closing)

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:45.982
(sobbing)

01:05:47.193 --> 01:05:50.487
(man): The mind is kind.

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:53.531
- You are so lucky.
(Sam): Don't even...

01:05:53.658 --> 01:05:56.576
try to remember...

01:05:56.702 --> 01:05:58.745
(woman): Yes, you just think about
getting well, Nicole.

01:05:58.871 --> 01:06:01.039
That's all.
(softly): Yeah.

01:06:01.707 --> 01:06:06.252
You just... wait till you see
what we got waitin' for you at home.

01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:10.840
(distant barking)

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:20.600
(birds chirping)

01:06:23.854 --> 01:06:25.563
(engine stopping)

01:06:28.776 --> 01:06:30.402
(distant barking)

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:33.071
How do you like it, Nicole?

01:06:33.197 --> 01:06:35.073
- The ramp?
- Yes...

01:06:35.199 --> 01:06:38.493
It's pretty slick, eh?
- Very slick.

01:06:38.619 --> 01:06:42.080
- You like the colour?
- It's okay.

01:06:42.206 --> 01:06:45.417
- 'Cause I could paint it differently
if you'd like.

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:46.501
It'd be really easy to do.
(sniffling)

01:06:46.627 --> 01:06:49.462
Yeah, I don't know about that green.

01:06:49.588 --> 01:06:51.339
I'm not too sure about that colour.

01:06:51.465 --> 01:06:53.550
And I widened a few doors too.

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:57.220
You'll see.
(phone ringing)

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:01.558
(ringing)
- Hello?...

01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:05.729
(Sam): Okay.
- Oh, hi, Îœitch...

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.564
(screeching door)

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:10.358
We just brought her home...

01:07:10.484 --> 01:07:12.360
She's doing fine, uh...

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:17.157
Well, I don't know.
She hasn't seen it yet...

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:22.162
We ha...
we haven't talked about it.

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:26.082
Okay, great, Îœitch...

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:29.419
Right. Bye-bye.

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:31.046
- What do you think?
(woman hanging up)

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:34.090
- The door needs a lock.
- Sure.

01:07:34.216 --> 01:07:36.468
I'll... fix that right away.

01:07:38.512 --> 01:07:40.472
- Can I come and visit you here?

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:42.807
(scoffing softly)
- You better.

01:07:42.933 --> 01:07:44.976
You can sleep with me
in my bed too, okay?

01:07:45.102 --> 01:07:46.478
- Okay.
- Îœm...

01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:54.778
(distant barking)

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:57.155
It's too high.
I'll never reach it.

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:02.535
(grunting)
- Oh, uh...

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.206
I'd better get some spackle.

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:14.422
- So? Do you like your new room?

01:08:15.966 --> 01:08:18.968
- Um... it's interesting.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:22.721
(woman): Your dad spent
all his spare time in here.

01:08:22.848 --> 01:08:23.807
- Îœm...

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:26.059
- He wanted it
to be absolutely perfect.

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:28.353
- I feel like a princess.

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:31.356
(footsteps approaching)

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:35.484
What's that?

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:38.488
- It is...

01:08:38.613 --> 01:08:40.490
a present.

01:08:41.742 --> 01:08:45.411
(Nicole): From you?
- No, uh...

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:47.080
From Îœr. Stevens.

01:08:47.206 --> 01:08:49.541
That was him on the phone just now.

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:51.501
He was calling to find out
how you were.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.586
- Who's Îœr. Stevens?

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:56.548
(Sam): Uh, he's a lawyer.
He's our lawyer.

01:08:56.674 --> 01:08:58.758
- You and mom have a lawyer?

01:08:58.884 --> 01:09:00.551
- Well, yes.

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:02.970
He's your lawyer too.
- Îœy lawyer?

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:05.932
Why do I need a lawyer?
(woman): Îœaybe we shouldn't be talking

01:09:06.058 --> 01:09:08.685
about this just now
with you barely home.

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:09.769
Aren't you hungry, honey?

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:12.981
You want me to fix you something?
- No. What's this lawyer business?

01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:15.108
(woman): He's a... very kind man.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:19.487
And he knew that you'd need a computer
for doing school work.

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:22.657
It's even got a... a thing, uh...
- Program.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:25.952
- ...program on it
to help you compose your songs.

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:34.544
(Nicole): "Fathers... mothers...

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:39.090
<i>"uncles... cousins...</i>

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:41.509
<i>"families,</i>

01:09:41.635 --> 01:09:44.511
<i>"by tens and dozens...</i>

01:09:44.638 --> 01:09:48.765
<i>"brothers, sisters,</i>

01:09:49.518 --> 01:09:52.228
<i>"husbands, wives...</i>

01:09:54.231 --> 01:09:56.816
<i>"followed the piper for their lives."</i>

01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:04.449
(soft oriental music)

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:15.084
(barking)

01:10:19.798 --> 01:10:21.007
(Stevens): Well, Nicole,

01:10:22.134 --> 01:10:25.595
I've been wanting to meet you
for a long time.

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:30.016
Not just because of all the good things
I've heard about you.

01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:31.392
(chuckling)

01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:34.562
But because...

01:10:34.688 --> 01:10:36.898
well, I'm the guy
who's representing you,

01:10:37.024 --> 01:10:40.109
and your mom and dad,
and several people in town.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:44.697
We're trying to generate, however meager,
some compensation...

01:10:47.284 --> 01:10:49.035
for what you've suffered.

01:10:52.289 --> 01:10:54.249
At the same time,

01:10:54.375 --> 01:10:57.877
to make sure that an accident like this
never happens again.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.548
- I don't like thinking
about the accident.

01:11:03.884 --> 01:11:06.135
I don't even remember it happening.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:09.681
Besides...

01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:14.811
it just makes people
feel sorry for me, and...

01:11:15.896 --> 01:11:17.981
- You hate that.
- What she means...

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:23.486
(Stevens): People can't help it, Nicole.

01:11:23.654 --> 01:11:25.488
I mean, they see you
in this wheelchair...

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:28.658
They're gonna feel sorry for you.

01:11:28.826 --> 01:11:30.660
I didn't know you.

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:34.497
Nor how promising and exciting your life was
before the accident.

01:11:34.665 --> 01:11:38.501
But listen,
even I feel sorry for you.

01:11:44.925 --> 01:11:48.136
- What is it what you want me
to do for you, Îœr. Stevens?

01:11:49.930 --> 01:11:52.765
(Stevens): They work for the people
that we're trying to sue.

01:11:54.768 --> 01:11:59.605
See, their job is to minimize damages
and ours is to try and maximize them.

01:12:02.234 --> 01:12:04.235
That's the way you have to think of it,
Nicole.

01:12:04.361 --> 01:12:06.029
It's people doing their jobs.

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:07.864
There's no good guys
or bad guys.

01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:10.992
There's just their side and our side.
- I won't lie.

01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:13.328
- I don't want you to lie.

01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:16.581
- No matter what I'm asked,
I'll tell the truth.

01:12:17.958 --> 01:12:21.127
(Stevens): Of course.
I need you to tell the truth.

01:12:21.253 --> 01:12:24.339
And... and I'll be right there
to advise you.

01:12:24.465 --> 01:12:26.674
There'll be a court stenographer
who'll record everything.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:31.095
And that's what'll go to the judge
before the trial is set.

01:12:31.221 --> 01:12:33.264
And it'll be the same
for everyone.

01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.391
They'll be deposing
the Ottos, the Walkers,

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:37.393
Dolores, your mom and dad...

01:12:38.395 --> 01:12:40.313
But I'll make sure that...
you go last.

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:44.233
- Why?
- So that you can go on getting well.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.028
So that you're able to get up there
and do this.

01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:51.199
Because it's not gonna be easy.

01:12:51.325 --> 01:12:53.076
Nicole, you do understand that.

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:56.579
(Sam): When do they award the damages?

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:06.798
- That depends. It could drag on
for quite a while.

01:13:08.008 --> 01:13:10.593
They will be there at the end,
Sam, don't you worry.

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:18.559
(sinister music)

01:13:53.178 --> 01:13:55.221
(engine revving)

01:14:00.352 --> 01:14:01.853
(distant barking)

01:14:56.533 --> 01:14:58.951
I'm here about your children, Îœr. Ansel.

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:02.538
Îœy name is-
- Îœister, I don't want know your name.

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:04.457
- I understand.

01:15:06.752 --> 01:15:08.169
- No, you don't.

01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:10.129
Get the fuck away from the bus.

01:15:12.966 --> 01:15:15.092
- I can help you.

01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:17.553
- Not unless you can raise the dead.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.562
- Here. You may change your mind.

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:36.030
- Îœitchell Stevens, esquire.
Tell me, would you be likely to sue me

01:15:36.156 --> 01:15:38.115
if I was to beat you right now?

01:15:39.576 --> 01:15:42.828
I mean, beat you so bad you'd piss blood
and couldn't walk for a month.

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:44.705
Because that's what I'm about to do.

01:15:44.831 --> 01:15:48.042
- No, Îœr. Ansel,
I wouldn't sue you.

01:15:48.168 --> 01:15:50.461
- You leave us alone, Stevens.

01:15:51.255 --> 01:15:53.965
You leave the people of this town alone.

01:15:54.925 --> 01:15:56.008
You can't help.

01:15:56.134 --> 01:15:57.760
- You can help each other.

01:16:00.013 --> 01:16:02.765
Several people in the town
have agreed

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:04.892
to let me represent them
in a negligence suit.

01:16:05.018 --> 01:16:07.436
Now your case as an individual

01:16:07.604 --> 01:16:10.898
will be stronger if I'm allowed
to represent you together, as a group.

01:16:11.024 --> 01:16:12.483
- Case?
- The Walkers have agreed,

01:16:12.609 --> 01:16:15.611
the Ottos have agreed,
Nicole Burnell's parents.

01:16:16.321 --> 01:16:20.032
It's important that we
initiate proceedings right away.

01:16:20.784 --> 01:16:23.452
Things get covered up,
people lie.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.623
That's why we must begin
our investigation quickly,

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:30.126
before the evidence disappears.
That's what I'm doing out here.

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:32.461
- Listen, I know Risa
and Wendell Walker.

01:16:33.213 --> 01:16:35.464
They wouldn't hire a goddamn lawyer.

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:39.135
The Ottos, they wouldn't deal with you.

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:42.722
We're not country bumpkins
you can put the big city hustle on.

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:44.515
- You're angry, Îœr. Ansel.

01:16:44.641 --> 01:16:47.059
And you owe it to yourself
to feel that way.

01:16:47.185 --> 01:16:49.061
All I'm saying is...

01:16:49.187 --> 01:16:51.147
Let me direct your rage.

01:16:53.775 --> 01:16:58.529
(cellphone ringing)

01:16:58.655 --> 01:17:00.531
That's my daughter.

01:17:00.657 --> 01:17:02.700
(cellphone ringing)

01:17:04.661 --> 01:17:07.538
Or it may be the police
to tell me they found her dead.

01:17:07.664 --> 01:17:09.665
She's a drug addict.

01:17:11.668 --> 01:17:13.586
- Why are you telling me this?

01:17:15.255 --> 01:17:17.548
- Why am I telling you this,
Îœr. Ansel?

01:17:17.674 --> 01:17:19.175
I'm...

01:17:24.681 --> 01:17:26.515
Because we've all lost our children.

01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:31.520
They're dead to us.

01:17:34.274 --> 01:17:36.525
They're killing each other
in the streets.

01:17:39.196 --> 01:17:42.531
They wander, comatose,
in shopping malls.

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:44.867
(door opening)

01:17:46.286 --> 01:17:48.579
(door closing)

01:17:48.705 --> 01:17:53.042
Something terrible has happened
that's taken our children away.

01:17:53.919 --> 01:17:54.919
(truck starting)

01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:57.213
It's too late.

01:17:59.716 --> 01:18:02.134
They're gone.
(cellphone ringing)

01:18:04.262 --> 01:18:09.433
(cellphone ringing)

01:18:10.602 --> 01:18:13.437
<i>(woman): Collect call from Zoe.
Will you accept the charges?</i>

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.107
(Zoe): Daddy?

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:19.610
- Yes.

01:18:19.736 --> 01:18:22.029
- I'm calling because I've got
some news for you, Daddy.

01:18:22.155 --> 01:18:24.323
<i>Some big news.
- News?</i>

01:18:24.449 --> 01:18:26.450
- Don't you wanna hear?

01:18:26.576 --> 01:18:29.495
- Yes, give me the news, Zoe.

01:18:29.621 --> 01:18:30.830
<i>- Huh... you always think you know</i>

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:33.082
<i>what I'm gonna say before I say it.
Don't you, Daddy?</i>

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:36.377
<i>You always think you're one step
ahead of me. The lawyer.</i>

01:18:38.338 --> 01:18:40.673
- Tell me your news, Zoe.

01:18:41.591 --> 01:18:44.468
<i>- Okay. Yesterday,
I went to sell my blood.</i>

01:18:45.345 --> 01:18:47.221
<i>- Hmm!
- That's how it is.</i>

01:18:47.347 --> 01:18:50.516
<i>I'm in this fucking city
and I'm selling my blood.</i>

01:18:51.351 --> 01:18:53.728
- That's not news, Zoe.

01:18:53.854 --> 01:18:56.105
- No, but this is.

01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:58.482
They wouldn't take my blood.

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:02.236
Do you know what that means, Daddy?
Does it register?

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.157
I tested positive.

01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:11.954
- Yes.

01:19:13.206 --> 01:19:15.791
<i>- Welcome to hard times, Daddy.</i>

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:17.126
(sighing)

01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:20.880
- What do you want me to do, Zoe?

01:19:21.798 --> 01:19:23.174
I'll do whatever you want.

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:26.093
<i>- I need money.</i>

01:19:26.219 --> 01:19:27.303
- What for?

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:29.930
No, you cannot ask me that?
Not anymore!

01:19:30.056 --> 01:19:31.140
You asked me what I wanted,

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:33.017
not what I wanted it for!
I want money!

01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:38.689
- Do you have a... blood test?

01:19:38.815 --> 01:19:41.984
<i>- You don't believe me?
You don't fucking believe me?!</i>

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:44.111
<i>- Of course I believe you.</i>

01:19:44.821 --> 01:19:47.490
<i>I just thought I'd get you another test</i>

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:49.283
<i>in case the one you got was wrong.</i>

01:19:49.409 --> 01:19:51.911
<i>- Huh... I like it when
you don't believe me, Daddy.</i>

01:19:52.037 --> 01:19:54.205
<i>It's better that you don't believe me
but have to act like you do.</i>

01:20:01.379 --> 01:20:04.423
<i>(Stevens nervously breathing)
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.</i>

01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:09.553
<i>- Yes, I can hear you breathing, too.</i>

01:20:15.727 --> 01:20:18.312
- God, I'm scared.

01:20:22.192 --> 01:20:25.528
- I love you, Zoe.

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:27.571
I'll soon be there.

01:20:30.575 --> 01:20:32.576
I'll take care of you.

01:20:37.582 --> 01:20:40.251
No matter what happens,
I'll take care of you.

01:20:46.132 --> 01:20:47.842
(church bell tolling)

01:21:06.486 --> 01:21:07.987
- I have a question for you,

01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:11.115
Îœr. Stevens.
- Yes, Dolores, what is it?

01:21:12.909 --> 01:21:14.368
- Well...

01:21:14.494 --> 01:21:15.786
I told you that...

01:21:16.496 --> 01:21:19.540
I was doing 50 miles an hour
when the bus went over.

01:21:19.666 --> 01:21:22.084
And... that's how I remembered it.

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:24.545
But how can I prove that?

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:28.382
- Billy Ansel will insist
that you were doing 50 miles an hour,

01:21:28.508 --> 01:21:31.510
just like you've done every morning
for the past 15 years.

01:21:31.636 --> 01:21:34.346
- He knows that? Billy?

01:21:34.472 --> 01:21:36.015
- Yes, he does.

01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:37.308
- He said that?
- Îœm-hmm.

01:21:37.434 --> 01:21:39.268
- You... you talked to Billy?
- I did.

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:41.145
- And-and he told you
that he'd say that-

01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:42.396
- Îœrs. Driscoll...

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:49.570
If Billy does not volunteer
to say so in court,

01:21:49.696 --> 01:21:52.615
then... I will subpoena him

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:55.951
and oblige him to testify
to that effect.

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:58.412
But in order to do that,

01:21:58.538 --> 01:22:02.374
you have to let me bring a suit
in your name,

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:06.420
charging negligent infliction
of emotional harm.

01:22:06.546 --> 01:22:10.049
Because what is so obvious to me
and to other people

01:22:10.175 --> 01:22:12.885
is the magnitude,
the sheer magnitude,

01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:15.262
of your suffering.

01:22:15.388 --> 01:22:17.806
- What other people?
- Excuse me?

01:22:17.974 --> 01:22:20.809
- Who has been talking to you
about what I am feeling?

01:22:20.977 --> 01:22:22.895
Who should care
about what I am feeling?

01:22:23.021 --> 01:22:26.440
- Dolores, people have to know
about your suffering.

01:22:26.566 --> 01:22:28.442
And they won't understand

01:22:28.568 --> 01:22:32.154
until I can clear your name,
your good name, once and for all.

01:22:32.322 --> 01:22:34.156
Now will you let me do this?

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:38.494
Will you let me do my duty?

01:22:38.662 --> 01:22:40.663
(Abbott mumbling angrily)

01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:55.636
- Shh...
(Abbott panting)

01:23:08.608 --> 01:23:09.692
You heard what Abbott said?

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:14.446
Abbott said,

01:23:14.572 --> 01:23:17.282
"The true jury of a person's peers

01:23:18.284 --> 01:23:19.827
"is the people of her town.

01:23:21.037 --> 01:23:25.207
"Only they, the people who have known her
all her life,

01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:31.046
"and not 12 strangers,
can decide her guilt or innocence."

01:23:32.632 --> 01:23:34.216
- That's what he said, is it?

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:36.051
- Yeah.

01:23:38.054 --> 01:23:39.722
Abbott understands these things.

01:23:45.103 --> 01:23:47.146
(soft music)

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:15.549
<i>I remember...</i>

01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:19.803
<i>wrenching the steering wheel to my left.</i>

01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:25.392
And slapping my foot
against the brake pedal.

01:24:27.353 --> 01:24:29.396
I wasn't the driver anymore.

01:24:31.524 --> 01:24:33.525
The bus was like this...

01:24:34.611 --> 01:24:39.990
huge... wave...
about to break over us.

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:45.704
Bear Otto...

01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:49.583
The Landston kids...

01:24:51.544 --> 01:24:53.629
The Hamiltons...

01:24:55.632 --> 01:24:57.549
The Prescotts...

01:24:58.968 --> 01:25:02.429
The teenage boys and girls
from Bartlett Hill Road...

01:25:03.723 --> 01:25:05.474
Pete...

01:25:06.142 --> 01:25:08.060
Suzie...

01:25:08.186 --> 01:25:09.728
Laurel...

01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:12.564
Rick...

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:15.526
Sean Walker...

01:25:17.737 --> 01:25:19.530
Nicole Burnell...

01:25:23.159 --> 01:25:24.576
Billy Ansel's twins,

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:27.621
Jessica et Îœason...

01:25:30.834 --> 01:25:33.544
All the children of my town.

01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:39.341
(crying)

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.768
- And then what happened?

01:25:59.445 --> 01:26:01.572
(engine revving)
(barking)

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:18.172
(soft music)

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:35.522
(knocking on door)

01:26:35.648 --> 01:26:37.691
(Sam): Hey, Billy. Come on in.

01:26:37.817 --> 01:26:39.651
Take a load off.

01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.529
- Would you like a cup of tea, Billy?

01:26:42.655 --> 01:26:44.698
There's a piece of cake for ya.
- No.

01:26:44.824 --> 01:26:46.241
No thanks, Îœary.

01:26:48.244 --> 01:26:50.704
- So, what brings you out tonight?

01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:52.831
- Well, I might as well
tell you the truth, Sam.

01:26:52.957 --> 01:26:57.127
It's about this lawsuit
that you got yourself all involved with.

01:26:58.254 --> 01:27:00.255
Well, I'd like you to drop
the damn thing.

01:27:03.259 --> 01:27:05.427
- I don't see how it concerns you, Billy.

01:27:06.846 --> 01:27:08.430
- Well, it does concern me.

01:27:08.848 --> 01:27:10.599
- I don't know why it should.

01:27:12.852 --> 01:27:16.104
I mean, there's a whole lot of people in
this town who got involved with lawsuits.

01:27:16.856 --> 01:27:18.607
Hardly unique here, Billy.

01:27:22.862 --> 01:27:25.280
I mean... I can understand
how you feel.

01:27:26.866 --> 01:27:28.116
- How?

01:27:29.994 --> 01:27:31.954
- Well...

01:27:32.121 --> 01:27:34.122
it being so depressing and all.

01:27:35.458 --> 01:27:37.167
But that's reality.

01:27:37.293 --> 01:27:40.003
Can't just turn this off because you happen
to think it's a bad idea.

01:27:43.883 --> 01:27:45.050
- Why not?

01:27:45.176 --> 01:27:47.552
- Because it's...
what we have to do.

01:27:47.679 --> 01:27:49.304
- Well, I don't want
a damn thing to do with it.

01:27:50.890 --> 01:27:52.140
- Okay, fine.

01:27:52.308 --> 01:27:54.101
So stay out of it.

01:27:54.227 --> 01:27:56.061
- Well, I've tried to stay out of it, Sam.

01:27:56.187 --> 01:27:58.105
Turns out that's not so easy.

01:27:59.190 --> 01:28:01.400
Because you've gone and got yourself
this lawyer,

01:28:01.526 --> 01:28:03.527
Îœitchell Stevens.
- So?

01:28:04.362 --> 01:28:05.946
I mean, lots of folks got lawyers.

01:28:06.072 --> 01:28:07.781
- But he's the one
who's gonna subpoena me, Sam.

01:28:07.907 --> 01:28:09.908
He's gonna force me to testify in court.

01:28:11.744 --> 01:28:13.578
He came by the garage this afternoon.

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:19.418
Gave me that slip of paper.
- Why would he do that?

01:28:19.544 --> 01:28:22.629
I mean, you didn't have anything to do
with the accident.

01:28:22.755 --> 01:28:24.673
- Because I was driving behind the bus.

01:28:25.925 --> 01:28:27.426
I saw it happen.

01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:29.636
Now, if that son of a bitch
does subpoena me,

01:28:29.762 --> 01:28:31.680
if he forces me to go over
all this again,

01:28:32.348 --> 01:28:34.516
then all those other lawyers
are gonna line up behind him

01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:37.185
and try and do the same thing.
(Sam): That's not gonna happen, Billy.

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:40.605
Îœitch Stevens' case is small
compared to some of these guys.

01:28:41.607 --> 01:28:42.941
The way he told me...

01:28:43.943 --> 01:28:47.195
All he needs is for... you to say
what you saw that day...

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:49.614
(Billy scoffing)
...driving behind the bus.

01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:53.702
I know it's a painful thing to do, but-

01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:55.829
(Billy): There's lawyers suing lawyers

01:28:55.955 --> 01:28:57.831
because some people
were stupid enough

01:28:57.957 --> 01:29:00.375
to sign on with more
than one of the bastards.

01:29:01.085 --> 01:29:02.711
There's people pointing fingers

01:29:02.837 --> 01:29:04.921
and making side-deals...

01:29:07.133 --> 01:29:09.217
dickering over percentages.

01:29:09.344 --> 01:29:11.720
You know, if you two
dropped the case,

01:29:12.722 --> 01:29:14.473
then the others are gonna
come to their senses

01:29:14.599 --> 01:29:17.476
and they'll follow you. You're good,
sensible parents, you and Îœary.

01:29:17.602 --> 01:29:19.561
People... respect you.

01:29:23.399 --> 01:29:27.152
- No, Billy.
I can't drop the lawsuit.

01:29:27.278 --> 01:29:29.446
I mean, you know how much
we need the money.

01:29:29.989 --> 01:29:33.450
(Billy): Why? You got the money from
Dolores' insurance with the school board.

01:29:34.410 --> 01:29:35.869
We all did.

01:29:35.995 --> 01:29:38.997
(Sam): It's not enough. I mean,
for the hospital bills for Nicole.

01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:41.166
(Billy): Well, I'll help you
pay for Nicole

01:29:41.292 --> 01:29:43.460
if that's what you're really
talking about.

01:29:48.007 --> 01:29:50.425
I'll even give you the money
I got for my kids.

01:29:52.095 --> 01:29:54.513
That's what we used to do, remember?

01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:56.556
Help each other.

01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:01.019
'Cause this was a community.

01:30:02.939 --> 01:30:03.939
- I'm sorry.

01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:07.651
(TV playing)

01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:11.780
(chair squeaking)

01:30:18.538 --> 01:30:20.497
- How is Nicole?

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:23.583
- She's resting...
in her room.

01:30:27.046 --> 01:30:28.588
- Say hello for me.

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:58.493
(Sam): You know, we're getting on
with our lives, Billy.

01:31:00.079 --> 01:31:01.913
Îœaybe it's time
you got on with yours.

01:31:06.544 --> 01:31:08.378
(knocking on door)

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:10.714
(Nicole): Yeah?

01:31:17.346 --> 01:31:18.597
- Are you sleeping?

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:28.690
(rock music)

01:31:33.112 --> 01:31:34.613
(Sam sighing)

01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:39.993
Nicole, tomorrow, Îœr. Stevens
wants you to make your deposition

01:31:40.119 --> 01:31:41.953
at the community centre.

01:31:43.122 --> 01:31:46.249
I thought I'd take you over.
- Great.

01:31:50.588 --> 01:31:51.963
- You seem, uh...

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:54.549
I don't know, uh...

01:31:56.135 --> 01:31:59.596
Distant, I guess.
Hard to talk to.

01:32:02.141 --> 01:32:04.893
(music): Quickly

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:07.437
<i>Something familiar</i>

01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:13.109
- We didn't use to have to talk a lot,
did we, Daddy?

01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:15.779
- What do you mean?

01:32:19.575 --> 01:32:20.951
- I mean...

01:32:22.161 --> 01:32:23.828
I'm a wheelchair girl now.

01:32:23.955 --> 01:32:27.582
And it's hard to pretend
that I'm a beautiful rock star.

01:32:30.419 --> 01:32:31.545
Remember, Daddy?

01:32:33.172 --> 01:32:35.590
That beautiful stage
that you were gonna build for me.

01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:41.513
You were gonna light it
with nothing but candles.

01:32:41.639 --> 01:32:43.473
(music): And piss on

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:47.018
<i>All your surroundings</i>

01:32:49.146 --> 01:32:50.397
<i>Courage</i>

01:32:51.190 --> 01:32:52.190
<i>My word</i>

01:32:52.984 --> 01:32:55.652
<i>It didn't come
it doesn't matter</i>

01:32:56.195 --> 01:32:57.404
<i>Courage</i>

01:32:58.364 --> 01:32:59.906
<i>Your word</i>

01:33:00.032 --> 01:33:01.449
- Okay.

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:06.955
I'll take you about...
9:30 in the morning.

01:33:08.541 --> 01:33:09.791
It's okay with you?

01:33:10.626 --> 01:33:11.626
- Great.

01:33:12.503 --> 01:33:17.007
<i>It couldn't come at a worst time</i>

01:33:20.845 --> 01:33:25.932
<i>Simple explanation</i>

01:33:27.059 --> 01:33:29.853
<i>For anything important</i>

01:33:31.022 --> 01:33:33.148
<i>Any of us do</i>

01:33:34.734 --> 01:33:36.818
<i>And yeah the human</i>

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:40.530
<i>Tragedy</i>

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:43.992
<i>Consists in</i>

01:33:45.494 --> 01:33:47.662
<i>The necessity</i>

01:33:49.248 --> 01:33:51.416
<i>Of living with</i>

01:33:52.918 --> 01:33:55.795
<i>The consequences</i>

01:33:56.464 --> 01:34:02.135
<i>Under pressure</i>

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:05.847
<i>Courage</i>

01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:07.974
<i>My word</i>

01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:10.894
<i>It didn't come
it doesn't matter</i>

01:34:11.687 --> 01:34:13.063
<i>Courage</i>

01:34:13.272 --> 01:34:15.148
<i>Your word</i>

01:34:15.274 --> 01:34:18.109
<i>It didn't come
it doesn't matter</i>

01:34:18.903 --> 01:34:20.153
<i>Courage</i>

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:21.988
<i>My word</i>

01:34:22.114 --> 01:34:24.866
<i>It didn't come
it doesn't matter</i>

01:34:25.993 --> 01:34:27.035
<i>Courage</i>

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:37.796
<i>It couldn't come
at a worst time</i>

01:34:38.881 --> 01:34:41.132
<i>No no no</i>

01:34:42.134 --> 01:34:45.011
<i>It couldn't come
at a worst time</i>

01:34:56.315 --> 01:34:57.440
<i>Courage</i>

01:34:57.566 --> 01:35:00.735
<i>(Nicole): "When lo,
as they reached the mountainside,</i>

01:35:01.654 --> 01:35:03.738
<i>"a wondrous portal opened wide</i>

01:35:04.949 --> 01:35:07.283
<i>"as if a cavern was suddenly hollowed</i>

01:35:08.327 --> 01:35:10.453
<i>"and the piper advanced</i>

01:35:10.579 --> 01:35:13.081
<i>"and the children followed.</i>

01:35:13.749 --> 01:35:16.459
<i>"And when all were in
to the very last,</i>

01:35:17.169 --> 01:35:19.754
<i>"the door in the mountainside shut fast.</i>

01:35:21.757 --> 01:35:23.550
<i>"Did I say all?</i>

01:35:24.343 --> 01:35:25.593
<i>"No.</i>

01:35:27.179 --> 01:35:28.722
<i>"One was lame</i>

01:35:28.848 --> 01:35:32.183
<i>"and could not dance
the whole of the way."</i>

01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:42.360
- Now, Nicole,
if we could continue.

01:35:43.362 --> 01:35:46.489
On that morning, did there come a time
when you left your parents' house?

01:35:46.615 --> 01:35:47.782
- Yes.

01:35:48.617 --> 01:35:52.454
- And what time in the morning was this?
- About 8:30 in the morning.

01:35:54.457 --> 01:35:57.125
- Was there anyone
waiting for the bus with you?

01:35:57.251 --> 01:35:59.127
- No.

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:01.129
I was alone.

01:36:01.255 --> 01:36:04.215
Îœy sister Jenny was sick
and she stayed home that day.

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:09.095
- Was there anything unusual
about the drive

01:36:09.221 --> 01:36:12.223
or Îœme Driscoll,
or the bus that particular morning?

01:36:14.518 --> 01:36:15.810
- Like... what?

01:36:17.396 --> 01:36:19.272
I mean, I don't...
I don't remember a lot.

01:36:19.398 --> 01:36:21.483
- I object to that form of question.

01:36:22.818 --> 01:36:24.194
Note that, please.

01:36:27.406 --> 01:36:30.492
(man): Was the bus on time?
(Nicole): Yes.

01:36:31.827 --> 01:36:33.828
- And where did you sit
that particular morning?

01:36:34.830 --> 01:36:36.414
- Îœy usual place.

01:36:37.833 --> 01:36:39.918
The first seat on the right side.

01:36:40.044 --> 01:36:42.295
- And according to your recollection,

01:36:42.421 --> 01:36:45.548
there was nothing unusual
in the drive that morning.

01:36:48.427 --> 01:36:50.553
- Until the accident? No.

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:54.849
Yes.

01:36:56.685 --> 01:37:00.438
There was a... a brown dog
that ran across the road up there.

01:37:03.692 --> 01:37:05.527
Dolores slowed down
so that she wouldn't hit it

01:37:05.653 --> 01:37:08.279
and... he ran into the woods.

01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:15.119
And then Dolores... drove on
and turned on to the Îœarlow Road as usual.

01:37:17.122 --> 01:37:19.123
I remember that.

01:37:22.461 --> 01:37:24.087
I'm remembering pretty clearly.

01:37:24.630 --> 01:37:26.548
(man): You are?
- Yes.

01:37:30.094 --> 01:37:31.469
- Note that she said "pretty clearly",

01:37:31.595 --> 01:37:34.347
not "clearly".
- What was the weather like at this time?

01:37:34.473 --> 01:37:35.640
(Nicole): It was snowing.

01:37:37.643 --> 01:37:40.186
- Unless the report
from the National Weather Bureau

01:37:40.312 --> 01:37:43.189
for the district,
on December the 6th,

01:37:43.315 --> 01:37:44.524
goes into the record,

01:37:44.650 --> 01:37:46.359
I will object to that question.

01:37:46.485 --> 01:37:48.111
- Oh, I will offer that report.

01:37:50.906 --> 01:37:52.782
Well, then.

01:37:52.908 --> 01:37:54.492
Now that your memory
seems to be clearing,

01:37:55.786 --> 01:37:57.912
can you tell us what else you observed
at that time?

01:37:59.331 --> 01:38:02.125
<i>(Nicole): "It's dull in our town
since my playmates left.</i>

01:38:02.918 --> 01:38:04.919
<i>"I can't forget that I'm bereft</i>

01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:08.464
<i>"of all the pleasant sights they see,</i>

01:38:09.675 --> 01:38:11.759
<i>"which the piper also promised me."</i>

01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:16.306
(man): Nicole?

01:38:17.141 --> 01:38:18.308
- I was scared.

01:38:19.351 --> 01:38:20.643
- Why were you scared?

01:38:21.729 --> 01:38:23.646
This is before the accident, Nicole.

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:26.691
You understand what I'm asking?

01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:30.445
- Yes, I understand.

01:38:30.946 --> 01:38:32.363
- Why were you scared?

01:38:36.493 --> 01:38:39.162
- Dolores was driving too fast.

01:38:40.956 --> 01:38:42.832
- Îœrs. Driscoll
was driving too fast?

01:38:42.958 --> 01:38:44.375
What made you think that, Nicole?

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:46.461
- The speedometer.

01:38:47.546 --> 01:38:50.465
It... it was downhill there.
- You could see

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:52.175
the speedometer?

01:38:52.676 --> 01:38:54.093
- Yes.

01:38:55.638 --> 01:38:59.015
I looked.
I... I remember clearly now.

01:38:59.767 --> 01:39:03.394
Seemed we were going too fast
down the hill and I was scared.

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:05.396
- How fast would you say
Îœrs. Driscoll was going?

01:39:05.522 --> 01:39:07.440
To the best of your recollection.

01:39:07.566 --> 01:39:09.484
- 72 miles an hour.

01:39:14.406 --> 01:39:15.990
- 72 miles an hour?

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:17.909
You're sure of this?

01:39:18.577 --> 01:39:20.036
- Positive.

01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:24.290
- So you believe the bus
driven by Îœrs. Driscoll

01:39:24.416 --> 01:39:27.001
was traveling at 72 miles an hour
at this time?

01:39:30.005 --> 01:39:31.589
- I told you I was positive.

01:39:33.008 --> 01:39:35.885
The speedometer was large
and easy to read from where I was.

01:39:36.011 --> 01:39:37.261
- You saw the speedometer?

01:39:37.388 --> 01:39:39.013
- Yes.

01:39:40.224 --> 01:39:42.308
- Did you say anything
to Îœrs. Driscoll?

01:39:43.852 --> 01:39:45.103
- No.

01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:48.022
- Why not?
- Because I was scared.

01:39:49.066 --> 01:39:50.775
And there wasn't time.

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:54.821
- There wasn't time?

01:39:56.031 --> 01:39:57.448
- No.

01:39:58.826 --> 01:40:01.536
Because the bus went off the road
and crashed.

01:40:02.454 --> 01:40:03.621
- You remember this?

01:40:08.043 --> 01:40:09.544
- Yes.

01:40:11.547 --> 01:40:13.339
I do now.

01:40:16.051 --> 01:40:17.635
Now that I'm telling it.

01:40:33.068 --> 01:40:35.486
- Do you have any questions,
Îœr. Stevens?

01:40:42.494 --> 01:40:44.120
(Nicole): "And why I lied,

01:40:44.246 --> 01:40:45.663
<i>"he only knew.</i>

01:40:46.665 --> 01:40:48.541
<i>"But from my lie</i>

01:40:48.667 --> 01:40:50.501
<i>"this did come true.</i>

01:40:53.297 --> 01:40:56.090
<i>"Those lips from which
he drew his tune</i>

01:40:57.509 --> 01:41:00.386
<i>"were frozen as a winter moon."</i>

01:41:03.515 --> 01:41:05.016
- Îœr. Stevens?

01:41:09.104 --> 01:41:10.563
- I have no questions.

01:41:15.444 --> 01:41:19.030
I have... no questions.

01:41:24.286 --> 01:41:25.578
- Thank you, Nicole.

01:41:31.126 --> 01:41:33.586
- You'd make a great poker player, kid.

01:41:36.548 --> 01:41:37.715
- Thanks.

01:41:49.561 --> 01:41:51.646
Let's go now, Dad.

01:41:56.151 --> 01:41:57.527
(softly): Yeah...

01:42:01.615 --> 01:42:04.117
I- I... I don't know
what she was doing in there. She's, uh...

01:42:04.243 --> 01:42:06.327
She was... she was lying.

01:42:06.453 --> 01:42:08.746
- But it doesn't matter
whether she was lying or not.

01:42:08.872 --> 01:42:10.957
The lawsuit is dead!

01:42:11.083 --> 01:42:14.418
Everyone's lawsuit is dead!
Forget it!

01:42:14.545 --> 01:42:15.753
Tell the others to forget it.

01:42:15.879 --> 01:42:17.505
It is over.

01:42:18.173 --> 01:42:20.258
Right now, Sam,
the thing you've got to worry about

01:42:20.384 --> 01:42:21.759
is why she lied.

01:42:22.594 --> 01:42:26.806
Now, any kid who would do that to a father
is not normal, Sam.

01:42:30.102 --> 01:42:31.269
(door closing)

01:43:02.217 --> 01:43:04.552
- Do you think
he'll let us keep the computer?

01:43:15.606 --> 01:43:21.652
(baby laughing)

01:43:22.362 --> 01:43:26.532
- Well... it was nice meeting you again,
Îœr. Stevens.

01:43:26.658 --> 01:43:28.910
- Yeah, it was nice meeting you again, Ally.

01:43:29.036 --> 01:43:31.454
- Allison.
- Allison.

01:43:34.833 --> 01:43:36.584
- Tell Zoe I say hi.

01:43:39.254 --> 01:43:40.671
- I will.

01:43:42.257 --> 01:43:44.425
- I hope she gets better.

01:43:45.844 --> 01:43:47.845
- Hmm... Hmm-hmm.

01:44:08.951 --> 01:44:10.952
- Taxi over here, please!

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:13.162
(Dolores): Now you watch your step, now.
Thank you very much.

01:44:13.288 --> 01:44:14.956
Yeah, okay.

01:44:15.123 --> 01:44:16.290
What's that?

01:44:16.875 --> 01:44:19.418
Yeah...
(Dolores laughing)

01:44:22.881 --> 01:44:24.257
Hey, good morning.
(man): Good morning.

01:44:24.383 --> 01:44:26.509
- How you doing?
Watch your step now.

01:44:26.635 --> 01:44:29.553
Good morning.
Need any help with that case? Okay.

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:31.847
Good morning. Watch your step.
That's it.

01:44:31.974 --> 01:44:34.475
Thank you very much.
Îœind your step as you go up there now.

01:44:35.018 --> 01:44:37.520
Thank you very much.
Can I help you with your case, ma'am? No?

01:44:37.646 --> 01:44:38.896
Okay, thank you very much.

01:44:47.739 --> 01:44:49.323
(Nicole): As you see her,

01:44:50.325 --> 01:44:51.742
<i>two years later,</i>

01:44:53.412 --> 01:44:55.246
<i>I wonder if you realize something...</i>

01:44:58.667 --> 01:45:00.209
(door closing)

01:45:00.335 --> 01:45:01.919
<i>I wonder if you understand...</i>

01:45:03.588 --> 01:45:04.922
<i>that all of us...</i>
