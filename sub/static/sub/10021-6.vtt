00:07.243 --> 00:08.870
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:09.078 --> 00:10.568
Dr. Carter, hi.

00:10.780 --> 00:14.238
- As of today, I'm only an intern.
- I heard, I couldn't believe it.

00:14.450 --> 00:16.042
Kerry, this is Dr. Dan Litvak.

00:16.251 --> 00:17.719
Just here to get a few tips?

00:17.921 --> 00:20.253
I had an interview
for the Chief position.

00:20.456 --> 00:23.516
- Have you not told everyone?
- My son's deaf, I know.

00:23.726 --> 00:26.820
- Don't you set policy?
- I'm here for the ride-along.

00:27.030 --> 00:30.761
If he gets vomit in his lungs,
he could die of aspiration pneumonia.

00:30.967 --> 00:32.901
Two of your classmates almost died.

00:34.237 --> 00:37.070
It was stupid of me to think you
could take responsibility.

00:45.348 --> 00:47.782
Doug, what are you doing? It's 5:00.

00:47.984 --> 00:50.418
I'm a week behind
on my Q and A reports.

00:50.620 --> 00:52.747
And that is the good news.

00:53.389 --> 00:54.856
How long have you been up?

00:55.058 --> 00:56.548
Haven't been to sleep.

00:56.759 --> 00:59.557
Oh, God, anything I can do?

01:00.863 --> 01:03.730
Go back to bed, no use
both of us being miserable.

01:04.700 --> 01:07.363
No, it's Ionely there without you.

01:07.804 --> 01:10.295
Keep that up, I'm never gonna finish.

01:10.640 --> 01:11.800
Sorry.

01:15.178 --> 01:17.908
Now I know how you felt
when you opened your clinic.

01:18.114 --> 01:20.139
It's pretty scary, huh?

01:22.352 --> 01:24.115
Are we both nuts?

01:24.487 --> 01:25.476
Yeah.

01:26.589 --> 01:28.079
But it's worth it.

01:33.062 --> 01:36.122
Oh, Dr. Carter.
I didn't think you'd be up yet.

01:36.332 --> 01:37.959
I left you a note.

01:39.702 --> 01:42.899
I just wanted to tell you
how sorry I am that you lost...

01:43.106 --> 01:45.631
...your R.A. Job because Halloween...
- Me too.

01:45.842 --> 01:50.370
I wondered if you thought it might
help if I wrote the dean a letter?

01:50.580 --> 01:53.378
Thanks, I think you've
done enough already.

01:53.583 --> 01:56.177
At least I could help pack.
I'm not on until 7:00.

01:56.386 --> 01:58.616
- No, I can manage.
- Where will you live?

01:58.821 --> 01:59.651
Ow!

02:00.189 --> 02:01.656
That's my leg.

02:03.626 --> 02:06.595
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you had company.

02:07.797 --> 02:09.059
See you at the hospital.

02:11.701 --> 02:13.896
I'm very glad you're moving.

02:21.711 --> 02:25.841
So your beef is with nurses asking
stupid questions over the radio.

02:26.049 --> 02:30.008
I'll say. Patients freak out when
someone asks if they got track marks.

02:30.219 --> 02:32.244
All right, I'll talk to the nurses.

02:32.755 --> 02:37.692
They asked me to remind you not to
restock your rig with their supplies.

02:38.027 --> 02:40.120
Oh, man, that is so lame.

02:40.329 --> 02:44.265
Nothing'll change unless we all throw
our gripes out on the table.

02:44.467 --> 02:47.402
Want to get some breakfast
before we head back?

02:47.603 --> 02:50.538
Definitely, I'm hungry.
I could use an omelet and...

02:51.140 --> 02:53.631
- What was that?
- Gunfire. Came from behind us.

02:54.377 --> 02:55.435
Looks like bangers.

02:57.980 --> 02:59.607
Someone's down!

03:03.619 --> 03:07.453
Unit 63, we have a possible GSW
on the 1600 block of Halsted.

03:07.657 --> 03:09.147
Gunfire in the vicinity.

03:09.358 --> 03:10.416
Why don't you back up?

03:10.626 --> 03:12.423
We have to wait for a secure area.

03:12.628 --> 03:13.617
I don't hear gunfire.

03:13.830 --> 03:15.889
That doesn't mean
it won't start again.

03:16.099 --> 03:20.001
- I'm not gonna wait in here.
- Protocol says we wait for backup.

03:20.970 --> 03:22.062
Wait!

03:24.607 --> 03:25.437
Damn it!

03:27.000 --> 03:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:35.718 --> 03:37.549
What the hell are you doing?

03:38.654 --> 03:41.782
Did you hear that?
We should not be out here.

03:41.991 --> 03:44.789
Doesn't mean they'll come back.
Give me a hand.

03:44.994 --> 03:46.461
Is he shot?

03:46.762 --> 03:48.855
There's no entrance wound.
He's beat up.

03:49.065 --> 03:51.499
Ready to roll him? All right, go.

03:58.374 --> 03:59.807
Stopped breathing, intubate.

04:00.009 --> 04:01.704
- Not here, in the rig.
- Now!

04:07.984 --> 04:10.714
There's too much blood, suction.

04:12.021 --> 04:14.353
Morales, gurney!

04:17.593 --> 04:20.221
- Can't see the cords.
- Want to crank his head back?

04:20.428 --> 04:21.726
We have to clear the C-spine.

04:22.632 --> 04:24.497
He's still not breathing.

04:25.101 --> 04:26.090
Extend his neck.

04:29.805 --> 04:31.136
You ER guys are nuts!

04:31.374 --> 04:33.604
- Yes, I'm in.
- Okay.

04:33.943 --> 04:36.104
Let's move him and bag him.

04:36.312 --> 04:38.712
One, two, three.

04:44.353 --> 04:45.342
I'm losing his pulse.

04:45.555 --> 04:47.887
We have to start two large IVs.

04:48.090 --> 04:49.819
You want to do that here too?

04:50.626 --> 04:52.890
No, we'll do it while we're rolling.

04:54.130 --> 04:58.760
Next time you decide to do
a ride-along, I'm taking a day off.

04:59.435 --> 05:02.131
Lights and sirens, let's go!

05:53.823 --> 05:55.051
Morning, what have we got?

05:55.258 --> 05:59.456
Sixteen-year-old male found beaten.
Sustained concussion, contusions...

05:59.662 --> 06:04.463
Head, neck and extremities.
BP's 140 over 80, pulse 110, regular.

06:05.134 --> 06:08.433
Good air entry bilaterally.
No evidence of pneumothorax.

06:08.638 --> 06:11.835
- Any I.D.?
- No, just a couple of bucks.

06:12.041 --> 06:14.976
Everybody, on my count:
One, two, three.

06:16.512 --> 06:18.980
- Cowboy Greene to the rescue.
- Babinski's normal.

06:19.181 --> 06:22.878
- BP 120/78.
- Regular rate and rhythm.

06:23.085 --> 06:26.885
- Spontaneous eye-opening.
- Okay, can you wiggle your toes?

06:27.857 --> 06:29.256
Yep, follows commands.

06:29.458 --> 06:32.825
- How's he doing?
- Stable, no apparent neurodeficits.

06:33.029 --> 06:34.189
That was some crazy stunt.

06:34.930 --> 06:36.693
You lucked out this time.

06:38.034 --> 06:39.160
What was that all about?

06:40.202 --> 06:43.000
Paramedics got perturbed,
I tubed him in the field.

06:43.205 --> 06:44.467
Radiology's here.

06:44.674 --> 06:48.132
So word is Dan Litvak
turned down ER Chief.

06:48.411 --> 06:51.505
- What happened?
- He played the committee for patsies.

06:51.714 --> 06:54.842
Used the offer to negotiate
a bigger salary back home.

06:55.051 --> 06:59.078
I shouldn't tell you this,
but you're the only other candidate.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.448
Really?

07:01.324 --> 07:04.487
- "Cat lover seeks roommate."
- Forget it.

07:04.694 --> 07:08.528
Would you consider joining
a communal vegetarian household?

07:09.031 --> 07:12.762
All right, here's one: "Furnished
apartment in old townhome.

07:12.968 --> 07:15.300
Access to full kitchen.
Many amenities."

07:15.504 --> 07:18.405
- That sounds promising.
- And not far from the hospital.

07:18.607 --> 07:21.132
I can set up an appointment
for you after work.

07:21.344 --> 07:23.403
- All right, see you later.
- Bye.

07:23.612 --> 07:27.070
Take a deep breath.
All right, blow hard. Hard!

07:29.852 --> 07:31.877
- You all right?
- Yeah.

07:32.254 --> 07:34.381
Pulse ox holding at 98.

07:35.057 --> 07:37.582
I'm Dr. Greene.
Do you know what happened to you?

07:37.793 --> 07:40.853
I was with a john.
Bangers tried to rob us.

07:41.063 --> 07:42.928
And my john pulled a gun.

07:43.899 --> 07:45.366
That's where I go blank.

07:47.403 --> 07:49.064
Found you on the street.

07:49.472 --> 07:50.871
Brought you here by ambulance.

07:51.073 --> 07:53.268
Why were you cruising
in my neighborhood?

07:53.476 --> 07:56.036
Sometimes I ride along
with paramedics.

07:58.481 --> 08:01.177
You're the first guy
who's ever saved my life.

08:01.384 --> 08:04.046
I don't go out in the street
for just anybody.

08:05.054 --> 08:07.614
- Guess I gotta grant you a wish now.
- What?

08:08.524 --> 08:13.587
Like <i>I Dream of Jeannie,</i> when Major
Nelson rescued her from a bottle.

08:14.997 --> 08:16.726
Start with your name and age.

08:17.299 --> 08:18.857
Kevin Delaney.

08:19.301 --> 08:20.928
I'm 16 years old.

08:21.203 --> 08:23.831
Lily, why don't you find
Kevin's labs...

08:24.039 --> 08:26.439
...and see if you can get us
an Exam Room.

08:26.642 --> 08:27.631
Sure.

08:28.511 --> 08:29.500
Where do you live?

08:29.712 --> 08:31.111
Where you found me.

08:31.614 --> 08:34.447
- Any family?
- None who want to know me.

08:34.917 --> 08:36.077
Why is that?

08:36.785 --> 08:39.118
Year ago my old man caught me...

08:39.321 --> 08:44.258
...having sex with my gymnastics
coach, he kicked me out of the house.

08:45.661 --> 08:47.458
Any other details you want to hear?

08:49.665 --> 08:52.998
So you survive by hustling.

08:53.502 --> 08:56.960
Yeah, well, someone's gotta pay
the bills, right?

08:57.339 --> 08:58.328
Use condoms?

08:58.541 --> 08:59.974
Sometimes.

09:00.176 --> 09:02.440
Customers pay more
to ride me bareback.

09:04.046 --> 09:06.310
We have a new rapid HIV test.

09:06.515 --> 09:09.484
You can get results in 20 minutes.
How about it?

09:10.219 --> 09:11.652
You want to bet I'm positive?

09:11.854 --> 09:13.719
Well, if you are, we can treat you.

09:14.223 --> 09:15.315
Sure.

09:19.395 --> 09:21.522
Looks like a good turnout
for the BP screening.

09:21.730 --> 09:25.860
I posted signs at the Senior Center.
If it stops raining, we'll be jammed.

09:26.635 --> 09:28.569
- Not so tight!
- I'm sorry, Mr. Levy...

09:28.771 --> 09:31.899
...but to get an accurate reading,
it has to be snug.

09:32.107 --> 09:33.438
It's too damn tight!

09:33.642 --> 09:35.507
Take it easy, I'll loosen it a bit.

09:35.711 --> 09:37.269
My arm's gonna fall off.

09:37.480 --> 09:39.744
Next time we should extend
the outreach.

09:39.949 --> 09:42.941
Go into the community, take BPs.
What do you think?

09:43.152 --> 09:46.485
That's not a bad idea.
Okay, your pressure's fine.

09:46.689 --> 09:47.849
No thanks to you.

09:48.057 --> 09:51.754
- Carol, you page me?
- Oh, yeah, I'll be right back.

09:52.895 --> 09:53.884
What's up?

09:54.096 --> 09:56.690
- I'm swamped here.
- I know, I know.

09:59.568 --> 10:01.900
- A lab coat?
- Yes.

10:02.571 --> 10:05.131
It's what every
division head should wear.

10:05.341 --> 10:06.603
No backing out now.

10:06.809 --> 10:08.106
What do you think?

10:08.310 --> 10:10.835
- Come here.
- I thought you said you're busy.

10:13.282 --> 10:15.250
- Not that busy.
- No?

10:16.585 --> 10:17.779
Carter, you paged me?

10:19.522 --> 10:23.458
Sixty-eight-year-old male with
a history of abdominal surgery.

10:23.659 --> 10:25.593
I'm thinking small bowel obstruction.

10:25.794 --> 10:27.921
- You do a three-way?
- Right here.

10:28.564 --> 10:31.328
Air-fluid levels, and he's got
a stepladder pattern.

10:31.934 --> 10:33.196
Good call.

10:35.037 --> 10:37.597
- I must've driven you crazy.
- What do you mean?

10:37.806 --> 10:40.468
My student, she's driving me nuts.

10:40.676 --> 10:44.203
Makes stupid mistakes.
Asks too many questions.

10:44.413 --> 10:46.142
Shows poor judgment.

10:46.916 --> 10:49.783
- How'd you put up with me?
- I never gave you any thought.

10:49.985 --> 10:53.045
- You didn't?
- Medical students don't know anything.

10:53.255 --> 10:56.281
It's your job to teach them,
not be their friend.

11:02.164 --> 11:05.600
Exhale, Mrs. Delpit,
like you're blowing out candles.

11:07.770 --> 11:11.433
Before listening with a stethoscope,
test for tactile fremitus.

11:12.575 --> 11:16.011
By placing your hand
on the patient's back...

11:16.211 --> 11:17.974
...and asking her to repeat "99."

11:18.180 --> 11:20.842
I haven't tested for that
since my first year.

11:21.050 --> 11:23.848
I have to be sure that you
can do a complete exam.

11:25.888 --> 11:26.877
All right.

11:27.156 --> 11:30.683
Mrs. Delpit, will you please
repeat "99" for me.

11:30.893 --> 11:31.882
Ninety-nine...

11:32.394 --> 11:33.861
...99...

11:34.129 --> 11:36.097
...99...

11:41.403 --> 11:43.496
Blood alcohol level came back.

11:43.706 --> 11:44.695
Did I set a record?

11:44.907 --> 11:47.876
No, but it's up there, 0.16.

11:48.077 --> 11:52.036
That's nothing, last time
I got picked up I scored a 26.

11:52.715 --> 11:54.376
I also have your HIV results.

11:55.217 --> 11:56.206
It's AIDS, right?

11:56.719 --> 11:58.311
No, good news, you're negative.

12:00.122 --> 12:02.682
I guess my johns don't need
rubbers after all.

12:03.826 --> 12:05.657
I'm gonna charge them a fortune.

12:05.861 --> 12:08.295
You won't stay negative
if you don't use protection.

12:10.532 --> 12:12.500
Time to get your life together.

12:15.170 --> 12:16.933
Yeah, I do kind of stink.

12:17.373 --> 12:21.036
Do you think I could get a shower?
Maybe some clean clothes?

12:21.844 --> 12:25.211
I'll have the nurses come
and take you to the shower room.

12:25.814 --> 12:26.803
Care to join me?

12:28.584 --> 12:30.449
No, thanks, I had one this morning.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.621
Peter, hold on.
Have you got a moment?

12:34.823 --> 12:37.189
Nope, I've got
a small bowel obstruction.

12:37.393 --> 12:41.159
I know, I'm operating with you.
Meet your new intern.

12:41.363 --> 12:43.194
- Since when?
- This morning, if you want.

12:43.399 --> 12:45.629
- Go ahead, bring him in.
- Okay.

12:46.001 --> 12:47.559
Was this Anspaugh's idea?

12:47.770 --> 12:52.070
It was mine, but Anspaugh supports it.
Enthusiastically, I might add.

12:52.608 --> 12:54.303
- I don't know.
- Come on, Peter.

12:54.510 --> 12:57.001
Don't be a wet blanket.
Think, no more Dale Scott.

12:57.212 --> 12:59.942
And you have the chance to work
with an alluring intern.

13:00.149 --> 13:01.639
I'm not comfortable with that.

13:01.850 --> 13:03.715
Why not? We've made a great team.

13:03.919 --> 13:07.150
When we were both Residents.
Now I'd have to be your boss.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.284
I don't mind if you don't.

13:10.492 --> 13:14.553
I'll be accused of playing favorites
if I don't treat you like an intern.

13:14.763 --> 13:16.594
I don't ask for special treatment...

13:16.799 --> 13:20.360
...just the chance to do something
more than pull drains.

13:20.569 --> 13:22.628
Elizabeth, I don't think it'll be...

13:22.838 --> 13:24.533
I don't think it'd be good for us.

13:25.641 --> 13:28.542
All right, I'll think about it, okay?

13:28.977 --> 13:30.501
You know what, you don't have to.

13:30.713 --> 13:32.874
I already heard your answer.

13:38.287 --> 13:39.379
Orange juice?

13:39.588 --> 13:42.751
You want orange juice, Reece?
Is that what you want?

13:42.958 --> 13:44.823
- Coffee, please.
- You want a sip?

13:45.027 --> 13:47.825
- You guys taking a lunch break?
- Hey. Yeah.

13:48.030 --> 13:50.430
Figured we'd get some air
since the rain stopped.

13:50.632 --> 13:51.621
Yeah, me too.

13:51.834 --> 13:53.961
He's getting so big.
You're gonna be...

13:54.169 --> 13:56.637
...tall like your daddy,
aren't you, huh?

13:57.172 --> 13:59.697
I wasn't aware that Reece
had a hearing problem.

14:00.476 --> 14:03.468
Yeah, we just found out recently.
He's deaf.

14:03.679 --> 14:04.805
Come on, man.

14:05.714 --> 14:08.683
What approach do you use
for language acquisition...

14:08.884 --> 14:10.681
...if you don't mind my asking?

14:10.886 --> 14:13.116
We're working with an audiologist.

14:13.655 --> 14:15.919
Have you looked into speech reading?

14:16.125 --> 14:19.822
He has residual hearing.
I'm looking for an aggressive ENT...

14:20.028 --> 14:21.996
...who'll consider him
for a cochlear implant.

14:22.197 --> 14:24.358
They'd have to destroy
his residual hearing.

14:24.566 --> 14:26.898
Yeah, but the technology
is very advanced.

14:27.102 --> 14:29.366
You should talk to Lisa Parks
at U of C.

14:29.571 --> 14:32.938
She's an outstanding physician
and has expertise in this.

14:33.142 --> 14:34.302
She's a friend of yours?

14:34.510 --> 14:37.104
I'll give you her number.
She's cutting edge.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.240
Thanks.

14:40.749 --> 14:44.241
ER? Yep, hold on. Dr. Ross.

14:44.453 --> 14:45.545
I'm busy here, Jerry.

14:45.754 --> 14:47.745
They said it was urgent.

14:48.390 --> 14:49.687
All right.

14:50.359 --> 14:52.122
This is Dr. Ross.

14:53.996 --> 14:55.691
You too, Carol.

14:56.865 --> 14:58.264
Where are you?

15:01.270 --> 15:02.737
I was just thinking about you.

15:02.938 --> 15:04.599
I have to get my sugar checked!

15:04.807 --> 15:07.071
Gotta go. What's the problem?

15:07.276 --> 15:09.676
That other nurse said
I have to come back.

15:09.878 --> 15:11.368
I have sugar diabetes.

15:11.580 --> 15:14.674
I schlepped all the way here
on a bus in the rain...

15:14.883 --> 15:16.714
...and she says I need an appointment!

15:16.919 --> 15:19.513
- Now, what is that?
- Okay, hang on.

15:19.721 --> 15:23.589
Did you tell Mr. Levy he'd need
an appointment for his blood check?

15:23.792 --> 15:26.420
Did he give you that song
about taking the bus?

15:28.130 --> 15:31.224
- He's got other complaints.
- Ladies, I hate to interrupt...

15:31.433 --> 15:34.197
...but I haven't had a bite
to eat all day.

15:34.403 --> 15:37.634
I have sugar diabetes. Hello?

15:37.840 --> 15:40.604
Okay, Mr. Levy,
I'll test your blood glucose once...

15:40.809 --> 15:43.300
...without an appointment.
Then we'll get you food.

15:43.512 --> 15:44.638
- You're an angel.
- Okay.

15:45.380 --> 15:47.644
Hope you got all afternoon.

15:47.850 --> 15:50.182
How did the accident happen, Kate?

15:51.286 --> 15:54.016
I lost it on gravel
coming down through a turn.

15:54.223 --> 15:56.657
Your dad said
you hit a curb and then fell.

15:56.859 --> 15:59.487
She fell onto the curb
after slipping on gravel.

16:00.429 --> 16:01.919
Okay, have a seat.

16:02.798 --> 16:03.787
You might have a fracture.

16:03.999 --> 16:08.459
I'll call Ortho after we get an x-ray.
We'll be right back.

16:08.670 --> 16:10.934
Have Medical Records send up
any old charts.

16:11.139 --> 16:12.504
Good idea.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.809
You feel any pain when I press here?

16:15.444 --> 16:17.412
Yeah, a lot.

16:19.181 --> 16:21.911
- When did you first feel the pain?
- In the shower.

16:22.351 --> 16:24.979
You had a blow to your leg.
Could be a blood clot.

16:25.187 --> 16:27.587
That's no big deal.
I've had them before.

16:27.990 --> 16:29.981
- You have?
- Yeah, sure.

16:30.192 --> 16:33.992
I've got a protein S deficiency.
My blood clots all the time.

16:34.196 --> 16:36.255
Should've seen the mother
I had a year ago.

16:36.465 --> 16:38.899
I wish you would've told me
your history before.

16:39.101 --> 16:41.763
I can't take care of you
if you're not straight.

16:43.071 --> 16:44.333
I can't be straight.

16:46.008 --> 16:48.135
Guess you want to order
a coag panel...

16:48.343 --> 16:51.107
...and clotting studies,
and start a heparin drip?

16:52.547 --> 16:54.879
When was the last time
you were hospitalized?

16:55.083 --> 16:57.551
Right before I took off from home.

16:58.153 --> 17:00.747
All right, I'm gonna
start you on the heparin.

17:00.956 --> 17:04.153
Then we're gonna move
to the Coumadin...

17:04.358 --> 17:08.125
...before you're to be discharged.
- No, I'm not taking Coumadin.

17:08.997 --> 17:13.900
Why not? You have a disease requiring
you to take a blood thinner forever.

17:14.102 --> 17:17.333
Coumadin and the streets don't mix.
You ought to know that.

17:18.140 --> 17:20.369
You don't want me back,
bleeding my brains out...

17:20.575 --> 17:22.236
...because I got drunk
and hit my head.

17:22.444 --> 17:23.843
You'd rather die of a blood clot?

17:24.046 --> 17:26.412
I don't sweat it, why should you?

17:28.349 --> 17:31.114
How much insulin did you take,
Mr. Levy?

17:31.320 --> 17:32.309
I'm not sure.

17:32.521 --> 17:35.183
The lady who used to come
always gave it to me.

17:35.390 --> 17:39.827
She also used to trim my toenails.
I think one of them is infected.

17:40.028 --> 17:41.290
I got pain in my left side.

17:41.496 --> 17:43.054
Mr. Levy's still here.

17:43.265 --> 17:47.224
Apparently, he took too much insulin.
His blood sugar is 61.

17:47.436 --> 17:50.098
I told you I needed to have
my blood checked.

17:50.305 --> 17:53.536
Look, you were right.
I'm really stuck.

17:53.742 --> 17:55.733
His home health aide took a new job.

17:55.944 --> 17:56.933
- Any family?
- No.

17:57.145 --> 17:59.739
His wife died last year.
No one else in town.

17:59.948 --> 18:02.109
We could try to get
a temporary placement...

18:02.317 --> 18:03.511
...until we find a new aide.

18:03.719 --> 18:05.243
I'm not going to a nursing home!

18:05.454 --> 18:07.217
Just temporarily, Mr. Levy.

18:08.256 --> 18:09.985
The desk guy said Mr. Levy's here?

18:10.192 --> 18:11.284
- You got my Kung Pao?
- Yes, sir.

18:12.127 --> 18:14.254
- Egg rolls?
- Yes, sir, all right here.

18:14.463 --> 18:16.158
- That's $8.50.
- Very reasonable.

18:16.365 --> 18:20.062
- You ordered Chinese?
- She said I needed to eat.

18:20.268 --> 18:23.465
- I'll get my wallet.
- Why don't you make it an even 10?

18:23.672 --> 18:25.037
Where's my fortune cookie?

18:25.240 --> 18:26.207
I was just wondering...

18:26.408 --> 18:29.070
...am I gonna get to work
with other ER Residents?

18:29.277 --> 18:31.745
Why, is there a problem?

18:31.947 --> 18:35.906
No, I just thought I'll learn more
by working with a variety of teachers.

18:36.118 --> 18:37.676
That's up to the Attendings.

18:37.886 --> 18:40.013
Why don't you tell me
about this patient?

18:40.722 --> 18:44.351
Brad Enloe, 12,
history of recurrent leukemia.

18:44.559 --> 18:46.652
Relapsed after
second induction of chemo.

18:46.862 --> 18:49.524
He's here today for a fever
and a sore throat.

18:49.731 --> 18:51.255
Poor kid's been through a lot.

18:51.466 --> 18:55.527
It's our job to treat the patient,
not feel sorry for him.

18:56.405 --> 19:00.273
Hi, Brad, I'm Dr. Carter.
This is my student, Lucy Knight.

19:00.475 --> 19:02.773
I hear your throat hurts.

19:02.978 --> 19:04.912
Yeah, it started this morning.

19:05.113 --> 19:06.944
He had a temp of 101.

19:07.149 --> 19:09.276
Check for cervical adenopathy...

19:09.484 --> 19:13.113
...and look for infection,
particularly in the ears and throat.

19:13.989 --> 19:16.480
- Does that hurt?
- Kind of.

19:16.691 --> 19:18.625
It's probably just a virus,
Mrs. Enloe.

19:19.528 --> 19:24.625
I'm gonna give Brad some ibuprofen,
and check his blood count.

19:24.966 --> 19:27.127
He's a candidate
for immunotoxin therapy.

19:27.736 --> 19:31.263
But unfortunately, he has
to be hospitalized to get the drug...

19:31.473 --> 19:36.035
...and our insurance turned him down.
They won't pay for experiments.

19:36.244 --> 19:39.702
If his neutrophil count
comes back under 500...

19:39.915 --> 19:41.542
...we'll admit him for antibiotics.

19:41.750 --> 19:43.718
He could get immunotoxins on the side.

19:44.953 --> 19:46.045
Is that a possibility?

19:47.322 --> 19:50.849
Why don't we cross that bridge
when we have the results?

19:55.363 --> 19:59.299
Does your clinic have any information
about shelters for runaways?

19:59.534 --> 20:01.502
- This for the kid you saved?
- You heard?

20:01.703 --> 20:05.639
I thought you were smoothing
things out between ER and paramedics.

20:05.841 --> 20:09.402
- I got a little carried away.
- Doesn't matter, you're a hero.

20:09.778 --> 20:12.474
- Yeah, if I don't kill him.
- What?

20:12.681 --> 20:14.546
He's got a clotting disorder.

20:14.749 --> 20:17.650
If I give him a blood thinner,
he could die in the street.

20:17.853 --> 20:20.219
If I don't treat him,
he could die of a clot.

20:20.422 --> 20:22.822
Oh, God, between a rock
and a hard place?

20:23.024 --> 20:26.482
Here's a pamphlet for a shelter
that takes in street kids.

20:26.695 --> 20:28.458
- Think you'll convince him?
- We'll see.

20:28.663 --> 20:30.358
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.361
Mr. Preston, can I talk to you?

20:33.568 --> 20:35.229
I'll be right back.

20:35.937 --> 20:39.703
I got Kate's old records. There's
a pattern that needs explaining.

20:39.908 --> 20:43.002
She wasn't riding a bicycle.
It's not what you're thinking.

20:43.211 --> 20:44.678
What is it?

20:49.251 --> 20:51.412
She was riding a unicycle.

20:51.987 --> 20:54.217
- A unicycle?
- Backwards, playing the violin.

20:54.422 --> 20:57.585
We were trying to break
a Guinness World Record.

20:57.792 --> 20:59.259
I didn't want word to get out.

21:00.695 --> 21:04.062
- And her split lip two months ago?
- Balancing glasses on her chin.

21:04.266 --> 21:07.099
- Knife cuts?
- We broke the potato-peeling record.

21:08.803 --> 21:10.634
Kate and I went through tough times.

21:10.839 --> 21:14.468
I was looking for things we could
do together. It sounds crazy...

21:14.676 --> 21:17.440
...but I found a three-legged marathon
we could enter.

21:17.646 --> 21:22.413
We won, and we kind of got hooked,
started breaking all kinds of records.

21:27.822 --> 21:28.811
May I help you?

21:29.024 --> 21:32.425
Yeah, I'm Peter Benton from County.
Kerry Weaver referred me.

21:32.627 --> 21:36.154
I'm Sara Jackson. She's with
a patient. I'll introduce you.

21:36.364 --> 21:40.061
Excuse me, on the door
it says "Family Medicine."

21:40.268 --> 21:41.758
I thought she was a surgeon.

21:41.970 --> 21:44.962
No, she has a family practice.

21:46.441 --> 21:50.878
Hi, I'm Dr. Benton. Listen,
don't let me interrupt your patient.

21:51.079 --> 21:54.606
No, that's not a problem.
I'm happy that you came over.

21:56.885 --> 22:00.286
I'm sorry, there must be
some misunderstanding.

22:00.488 --> 22:03.548
No, Kerry told me about your son.

22:03.758 --> 22:08.786
I'd be happy to discuss cochlear
implants, and other options too.

22:10.098 --> 22:13.226
I guess she didn't tell you
I was deaf, huh?

22:13.435 --> 22:14.925
No, she didn't.

22:19.040 --> 22:22.999
Dr. Parks asked that when you speak
to her, you look directly at her...

22:23.211 --> 22:24.269
...so she can read lips.

22:24.479 --> 22:28.415
Oh, I'm sorry. Look, I said,
I didn't know you were deaf.

22:29.451 --> 22:30.884
That's all right.

22:31.353 --> 22:35.312
Can we talk?
Do you have time for some coffee?

22:35.523 --> 22:37.514
Yeah, all right, yeah.

22:37.726 --> 22:42.026
Just let me finish up with
this patient, and then we'll all go.

22:43.298 --> 22:44.629
Great.

22:49.104 --> 22:53.905
You must be very confused trying
to decide what's best for your son.

22:54.109 --> 22:58.273
Look, I want my son to be able
to function in the world.

23:01.650 --> 23:05.381
As you can see, I function
pretty well without an implant.

23:05.587 --> 23:09.785
Yeah, but if an implant can help
him to hear, why not get one?

23:12.861 --> 23:15.694
Well, there are other options.

23:17.399 --> 23:21.358
Look, I don't want my son to have
to depend on others, no offense.

23:24.606 --> 23:27.074
Do you know any deaf people?

23:27.909 --> 23:29.342
No, I don't.

23:30.812 --> 23:34.646
Have you ever thought that being deaf
might not be so terrible?

23:36.284 --> 23:38.411
So you're saying there's no problem?

23:40.221 --> 23:42.815
You can never know
what it's like being deaf.

23:43.024 --> 23:47.222
Just like I can never know
what it's like being black.

23:47.429 --> 23:52.264
I don't look at me being black
as a burden. That's who I am.

23:53.802 --> 23:58.671
And I don't look at my deafness
as a burden. That's who I am.

24:00.208 --> 24:03.109
If you turn away
from your son's deafness...

24:03.311 --> 24:05.677
...you will be robbing him
of his identity.

24:06.948 --> 24:08.176
My son has a medical problem.

24:08.383 --> 24:10.613
I'm not turning away,
I'm trying to fix it.

24:17.826 --> 24:19.020
Late for a meeting?

24:19.227 --> 24:21.923
If I can get through
this administrative hellhole...

24:22.130 --> 24:25.224
...maybe I'll get to see
a few kids again.

24:26.735 --> 24:29.033
You can do it, keep going.

24:31.606 --> 24:33.005
You're doing great, Dad.

24:33.208 --> 24:35.574
Beats juggling cantaloupes.

24:35.777 --> 24:38.439
Two hours he's been at it,
hasn't dropped one yet.

24:40.482 --> 24:43.815
The orthopedic surgeon is gonna
come and examine your wrist.

24:44.018 --> 24:46.919
Is it all right if I watch
my dad till he gets here?

24:47.122 --> 24:49.818
He's trying to break
the juggling record.

24:50.024 --> 24:53.050
Kate, did your dad force you
to ride that unicycle?

24:53.261 --> 24:56.094
Force me? Oh, no, it was my idea.

24:56.297 --> 24:57.423
You've had a lot of injuries.

24:58.032 --> 25:00.865
Dad and I always take
Guinness-approved precautions.

25:01.069 --> 25:04.129
If you're gonna be a record breaker,
you gotta take chances.

25:04.339 --> 25:05.772
Play it safe and life's boring.

25:07.275 --> 25:11.439
Here's when we broke the marathon.
That's me and Dad, we're in the book.

25:12.247 --> 25:14.215
I'll give you Accutane for the acne.

25:14.416 --> 25:16.441
But you'll need birth control pills.

25:16.651 --> 25:18.516
Birth control pills?

25:18.720 --> 25:21.245
Accutane is a very effective
medication.

25:21.456 --> 25:26.086
But if you were to get pregnant,
it could cause terrible birth defects.

25:26.294 --> 25:28.455
I won't have sex, I promised my mom.

25:29.464 --> 25:30.863
I believe you, Nava...

25:31.065 --> 25:35.559
...but it's my policy to give birth
control to girls who take Accutane.

25:35.770 --> 25:37.465
My mom won't let me take them.

25:37.672 --> 25:39.697
Have her call me.
I'll explain it to her.

25:39.908 --> 25:41.739
I don't think she'll change her mind.

25:43.144 --> 25:45.135
Okay, then...

25:46.147 --> 25:48.047
...I can't give you this medication.

25:51.653 --> 25:55.555
- Brought you these.
- Thanks. What's that?

25:55.757 --> 25:57.122
You might want to read about...

25:57.325 --> 25:59.759
...advances on protein S deficiency.

25:59.961 --> 26:03.556
Hey, look, I like you,
but I'm really not worth it.

26:03.765 --> 26:05.733
There's a list of homeless shelters.

26:05.934 --> 26:09.165
If you can't go home,
you might as well go to one.

26:09.370 --> 26:11.201
There you can take your Coumadin.

26:11.406 --> 26:13.897
Then what?
Maybe get a job at McDonald's?

26:14.108 --> 26:19.273
You're a smart guy.
You get a GED, maybe go to college.

26:19.481 --> 26:22.848
- Look, what's the use?
- Would you rather die on the streets?

26:28.089 --> 26:30.182
You know, you're cute
when you get angry.

26:30.725 --> 26:34.559
Is that the only way you can relate
to me, by turning me into a customer?

26:36.498 --> 26:38.898
Okay, I'll read them.

26:39.334 --> 26:41.029
Anything for you.

26:44.839 --> 26:48.070
Hey, can you write me a scrip
for birth control pills?

26:48.276 --> 26:51.006
That young lady decided
to take them after all?

26:51.212 --> 26:52.907
Yeah, she said she would.

26:53.114 --> 26:54.672
You know...

26:56.417 --> 26:59.784
...you have no business
giving her birth control pills...

26:59.988 --> 27:02.252
...since she and her mom
don't want them.

27:02.457 --> 27:04.118
And what if she got pregnant?

27:04.325 --> 27:05.986
You heard, she's not sexually active.

27:06.194 --> 27:10.028
She's a teenager, that doesn't
guarantee she's not gonna have sex.

27:10.398 --> 27:12.491
You are undermining her choice.

27:12.700 --> 27:14.827
Giving her the pills
isn't gonna make her have sex.

27:15.036 --> 27:17.903
Listen, how would you feel
if you were that girl...

27:18.106 --> 27:20.074
...and a white nurse
said she didn't trust you?

27:20.275 --> 27:22.743
I wouldn't like it
no matter what color.

27:23.211 --> 27:26.578
All I'm saying is, you don't know
that girl or her mother.

27:26.781 --> 27:28.408
You're volunteering to talk to her?

27:28.616 --> 27:32.609
No, I just think it's wrong for you
to force birth control on the girl.

27:32.820 --> 27:36.688
Well, maybe.
But I'm not gonna take any chances.

27:36.891 --> 27:41.225
Dr. Carter, labs are back on
Brad Enloe. You should look at them.

27:41.896 --> 27:43.864
His neutrophil count's over 1000.

27:44.065 --> 27:45.965
- We can't admit him.
- He's not septic.

27:46.167 --> 27:48.635
Right, he's only dying of leukemia.

27:48.836 --> 27:51.396
He vomited after I gave him ibuprofen.

27:52.540 --> 27:53.871
- Really?
- Yep.

27:54.075 --> 27:56.236
- When?
- Couple of minutes ago.

27:58.112 --> 28:00.046
He's dehydrated.
We're gonna admit him.

28:00.248 --> 28:03.513
Call upstairs, tell them we have
an admit for Pedes.

28:03.718 --> 28:07.119
- He only vomited once.
- I know, make the call.

28:08.523 --> 28:10.889
- He needs to be rehydrated.
- I can start an IV.

28:11.092 --> 28:12.889
You shouldn't do one on the kid.

28:13.094 --> 28:14.857
- I can do it.
- Been through chemo.

28:15.063 --> 28:18.191
His veins are sclerosed.
Not this one.

28:19.300 --> 28:20.232
- Hey, Doug.
- Hey!

28:20.435 --> 28:22.130
Write me a scrip
for birth control?

28:22.337 --> 28:24.305
- Thought you swore it off.
- For a patient.

28:24.505 --> 28:26.700
- When did you hear?
- Half-hour ago.

28:26.908 --> 28:28.239
Hey, Mark.

28:28.743 --> 28:30.438
Whenever you have a minute?

28:30.645 --> 28:32.374
Yeah, I'll be right there.

28:34.949 --> 28:37.577
Kerry knows this ER better than
anybody we'd hire.

28:37.785 --> 28:41.016
I agree, but the committee wants
a star with a reputation...

28:41.222 --> 28:42.484
...who can bring in grants.

28:42.690 --> 28:46.057
- Mark, trauma's pulling up.
- I'll tell her.

28:46.260 --> 28:50.594
You sure? Mark, no sense in telling
Kerry she was our second choice.

28:50.798 --> 28:52.322
Only disappoint her even more.

28:53.034 --> 28:54.331
Right.

28:57.271 --> 29:00.399
- Here we go, here we go.
- What the hell?

29:00.608 --> 29:02.940
Brothers got into a fight
on the expressway...

29:03.144 --> 29:05.704
...Iost control.
I've never seen such a mess.

29:05.913 --> 29:08.677
- You idiot, I said turn left.
- Sorry, Marcus.

29:08.883 --> 29:11.078
You jackass.
Can't believe I let you drive.

29:11.285 --> 29:12.411
You never watch the road.

29:12.620 --> 29:16.818
Eddy and Marcus Haney, carpet-layers.
Carpet cement spilled all over them.

29:17.025 --> 29:19.926
- Stuck to their seat.
- You get stuck, you're on your own.

29:20.128 --> 29:22.926
- You're a moron, you know that?
- Just relax.

29:23.131 --> 29:25.429
How can I relax
when that idiot did this?

29:25.633 --> 29:28.727
Okay, pulse is strong.
Pupils react to light.

29:28.936 --> 29:30.767
Lydia, get me a glove change here.

29:30.972 --> 29:33.998
This stuff is like taffy.
How's he doing?

29:35.476 --> 29:36.465
What is that?

29:39.313 --> 29:41.281
Got an impalement of some kind.

29:42.617 --> 29:46.951
Oh, my God! It looks like
some kind of tool with sharp prongs.

29:47.155 --> 29:48.486
Not the hand stretcher?

29:49.123 --> 29:50.522
- Four-by-fours.
- Eddy?

29:50.725 --> 29:52.215
Just don't move so much.

29:52.427 --> 29:54.622
- We're gonna take care of him.
- Oh, man!

29:54.829 --> 29:57.320
Bleeding man here.
Let's take him to Trauma!

29:57.532 --> 29:58.965
Gently.

29:59.467 --> 30:02.527
- Malik, try and get monitor leads on.
- How?

30:02.737 --> 30:05.228
Get a tongue depressor,
scrape off a few spots.

30:05.440 --> 30:06.873
Why did Eddy stop talking?

30:07.075 --> 30:09.066
Hold still.
If you move, you'll kill him.

30:09.277 --> 30:11.609
- Pulse ox falling.
- Stand by with intubation.

30:11.813 --> 30:14.509
I'll get a tray and an 8.0 ET tube.

30:15.450 --> 30:16.974
Covering Dr. Benton, need consult?

30:17.185 --> 30:20.154
We've got an impalement.
Watch out for the glue.

30:20.354 --> 30:23.482
- Lucy, have you ever intubated?
- No, but I'd like to.

30:23.691 --> 30:24.885
Pretty tough intubation.

30:25.093 --> 30:26.720
Let's find out, talk her through.

30:27.028 --> 30:28.017
Great.

30:29.597 --> 30:31.929
Runs of PVCs when he's jostled...

30:32.133 --> 30:35.125
...from the tool against the heart.
Carter, get the crash cart.

30:35.336 --> 30:36.598
- Lydia?
- On it.

30:36.804 --> 30:39.898
Malik, we need the cutter down here
as fast as you can.

30:40.108 --> 30:42.872
Hang in there, Eddy, all right?
You're gonna be okay.

30:43.077 --> 30:44.237
Carter, I need you here...

30:44.445 --> 30:48.814
...and carefully pull Marcus away
so that Lucy has room to intubate.

30:50.852 --> 30:52.649
- Can you get in?
- Yeah, a little more.

30:52.854 --> 30:54.651
Lydia, snap some pictures.

30:54.856 --> 30:58.087
New policy: We're documenting
our interesting traumas.

30:58.292 --> 30:59.281
Take her through it.

30:59.494 --> 31:01.553
All right, pass the tube.

31:05.299 --> 31:06.698
Not too far.

31:09.170 --> 31:10.728
All right, take out the scope.

31:10.938 --> 31:12.530
Pull the stylet.

31:13.708 --> 31:14.697
Confirm your position.

31:14.909 --> 31:16.137
I'm in.

31:16.344 --> 31:17.811
Good job.

31:18.713 --> 31:20.840
Lets call Respiratory for a vent.

31:21.949 --> 31:23.814
I hear good breath sounds.

31:24.051 --> 31:25.985
- He's in SVT!
- We need to shock him.

31:26.187 --> 31:28.417
Not while they're attached.
Try Adenocard.

31:28.623 --> 31:29.612
Please save my brother.

31:30.458 --> 31:32.926
- Carter, let go.
- I'm stuck!

31:33.127 --> 31:34.560
Charging, 200!

31:34.762 --> 31:36.320
Get out of your gloves and gown.

31:36.531 --> 31:38.658
- My beard is stuck.
- Got the cutters.

31:40.735 --> 31:41.724
Pull back, Carter.

31:42.436 --> 31:43.835
I need some exposed skin!

31:50.244 --> 31:52.109
I'm stuck!

31:55.383 --> 31:56.645
Clear!

32:00.388 --> 32:01.480
Got a pulse!

32:01.689 --> 32:04.556
Good job, everybody.
Let's get him to the O.R.

32:10.932 --> 32:13.594
- Still want pictures?
- Might as well.

32:14.635 --> 32:16.227
Carter?

32:16.437 --> 32:17.426
Carter, you all right?

32:17.638 --> 32:18.764
Yeah, I think so.

32:18.973 --> 32:20.702
Thank you for saving my brother.

32:20.908 --> 32:23.934
Just doing our job.
We need to extricate Dr. Carter.

32:24.145 --> 32:26.773
So, Lucy, why don't you start
with his beard?

32:34.488 --> 32:36.217
He was juggling while on
a pogo stick?

32:36.424 --> 32:39.655
- Yeah, a guy in Zurich.
- What about while skydiving?

32:39.861 --> 32:44.059
Isabella from Tangiers holds
the record for juggling five balls.

32:44.265 --> 32:45.698
How long has he been at it?

32:46.500 --> 32:48.559
- For over 31/2 hours.
- What's the record?

32:48.769 --> 32:51.237
Eleven hours, four minutes,
22 seconds.

32:51.439 --> 32:54.135
It's in the book.
Kate's documenting the event.

32:54.342 --> 32:55.934
This could be our first time on TV.

32:56.310 --> 32:58.710
Less than eight hours to go.

32:59.146 --> 33:01.205
- Dad!
- Jerry, watch out!

33:06.187 --> 33:09.918
Congratulations, never thought
you'd unstick the glue brothers.

33:11.359 --> 33:14.419
- Guess you can fix about anything?
- We try.

33:14.629 --> 33:17.097
I got a call.
You picked up a kid, Delaney?

33:17.298 --> 33:19.562
- We got a warrant for his arrest.
- What for?

33:20.301 --> 33:22.769
Parole violation,
prostitution, the usual.

33:23.237 --> 33:24.795
How long do you expect to keep him?

33:25.006 --> 33:27.634
Hard to say, we're treating him
for blood clotting.

33:27.842 --> 33:30.675
Call when you release him.
We'll pick him up.

33:30.878 --> 33:33.005
Yeah, I'm a doctor, I'm not a cop.

33:34.715 --> 33:36.080
He needs a second chance.

33:36.284 --> 33:38.149
I'm a cop, not a social worker.

33:38.352 --> 33:39.785
You do your job, I'll do mine.

33:39.987 --> 33:42.387
If he gets beat up in jail,
he'll bleed to death.

33:42.590 --> 33:45.388
If I don't pick him up,
somebody else will.

33:45.593 --> 33:47.925
I have a sitter to guard him
until his discharge.

33:51.365 --> 33:52.696
Good job on the trauma.

33:58.105 --> 34:00.938
- You came pretty close.
- We'll try again later.

34:01.142 --> 34:02.507
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:02.710 --> 34:04.177
Kate ready to be discharged?

34:04.378 --> 34:06.278
Bring her back for a cast check.

34:06.480 --> 34:08.539
- No jumping around?
- Not for six weeks.

34:08.748 --> 34:10.944
- Thank you for being so kind.
- You're welcome.

34:11.152 --> 34:12.346
- Thanks.
- Okay, bye.

34:12.553 --> 34:14.043
I'll miss the event at the pier.

34:14.255 --> 34:16.348
Sorry, sweetheart.
You want to go watch?

34:16.556 --> 34:18.616
- I guess.
- Okay.

34:20.628 --> 34:22.289
Brad's bed is ready.

34:22.496 --> 34:26.364
I've written orders for Oncology
to continue to rehydrate him.

34:26.567 --> 34:28.592
Thank you, Dr. Carter.

34:29.437 --> 34:31.701
You should feel fine in a couple days.

34:31.906 --> 34:34.067
- Good luck with your treatment.
- Thanks.

34:34.275 --> 34:36.937
- Malik, can you take him up?
- Yeah, sure.

34:37.143 --> 34:39.304
He isn't dehydrated, is he?

34:39.746 --> 34:41.237
He vomited, I gave him fluids.

34:41.449 --> 34:42.438
What will Oncology say?

34:42.650 --> 34:45.118
All they want is a diagnosis
for his admission.

34:45.319 --> 34:46.308
I gave them one.

34:46.520 --> 34:47.885
Can you give him an IV?

34:48.089 --> 34:49.386
Was the only way to admit him.

34:49.590 --> 34:52.081
- So you lied?
- Technically, yeah.

34:52.293 --> 34:53.987
Sometimes you gotta work the system.

34:54.195 --> 34:55.719
You lied?

34:57.498 --> 34:59.261
I didn't know you were there.

34:59.467 --> 35:01.264
Is it true Brad's not dehydrated?

35:01.469 --> 35:03.096
It's a way for him to get chemo.

35:03.304 --> 35:04.771
What if my insurance finds out?

35:04.972 --> 35:08.237
- I see no reason why they should.
- I do, they've challenged claims.

35:08.442 --> 35:10.501
If they find out,
Brad loses his coverage.

35:10.711 --> 35:13.441
Then what do we do
when his leukemia gets worse?

35:13.647 --> 35:16.241
I don't see another
way of going about doing this.

35:16.450 --> 35:18.475
I'll talk to you later.

35:18.753 --> 35:20.744
Cop stopped by earlier.

35:20.955 --> 35:23.719
Still wants to take you in
after I discharge you.

35:23.924 --> 35:27.257
- What did you tell him?
- That you were sick.

35:27.461 --> 35:29.986
- Are they gonna put me in juvie?
- They want to.

35:30.197 --> 35:33.530
I can't go back there.
I'm a punching bag for those guys.

35:33.734 --> 35:35.031
I know.

35:35.269 --> 35:38.602
I gotta tell you, getting heparinized
is the best treatment.

35:38.806 --> 35:42.469
Great. Listen, I can't stick
around here if the cops are coming.

35:42.676 --> 35:43.904
Figured you'd say that.

35:52.787 --> 35:54.482
Are you setting me up?

36:00.828 --> 36:04.594
If your leg starts to hurt or gets
swollen, you have to come back.

36:05.366 --> 36:08.096
Here's 50 bucks and my pager number.

36:14.308 --> 36:17.038
Coumadin and a list of shelters.

36:19.580 --> 36:21.275
I never promised you I'd take that.

36:21.482 --> 36:22.744
I know.

36:28.556 --> 36:29.853
Maybe I'll see you around?

36:49.009 --> 36:51.136
Hey, Peter, you missed a great trauma.

36:51.345 --> 36:53.813
Yeah? I was out talking to Dr. Parks.

36:54.014 --> 36:55.641
What did you think of her?

36:56.217 --> 37:00.813
She had the audacity to say Reece
should be with deaf kids more than me.

37:01.021 --> 37:05.014
Yeah, I should've warned you.
Lisa has very strong opinions.

37:05.226 --> 37:06.215
Opinions?

37:06.427 --> 37:10.295
Well, she doesn't mind being deaf.
She doesn't want to be cured.

37:10.498 --> 37:12.728
I thought you'd want
to see what she's achieved.

37:12.933 --> 37:15.993
I don't want my son to live
with a defect if I can help it.

37:16.203 --> 37:17.192
"Defect"?

37:18.739 --> 37:19.967
What do you mean by that?

37:21.909 --> 37:24.673
It means, what I do with
my son is my business.

37:27.348 --> 37:29.782
Be sure and let me know
how things work out.

37:29.984 --> 37:31.576
God bless you, sweetheart.

37:31.785 --> 37:34.879
I thought the nursing home said
they wouldn't have a bed.

37:35.089 --> 37:38.718
Stan's not going there.
What you said earlier was right.

37:38.926 --> 37:42.020
We need to know the patient's
community. I called his temple.

37:42.229 --> 37:45.357
Another member with diabetes
said he'd stay with him.

37:45.866 --> 37:48.426
- Good idea.
- Doesn't hurt to do a little outreach.

37:48.636 --> 37:50.695
Mr. KIoner will be staying with you.

37:52.940 --> 37:55.033
What's that son of a bitch doing here?

37:55.242 --> 37:56.607
I should have known.

37:57.578 --> 37:59.102
I spit on your grave!

37:59.313 --> 38:00.439
I'll see you dead first!

38:00.648 --> 38:03.173
You owe me $20,000 for
that time-share in Florida!

38:03.384 --> 38:04.874
It's a shack in a swamp!

38:08.489 --> 38:11.754
There you are. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

38:14.328 --> 38:15.352
I'm late for an appointment...

38:15.563 --> 38:17.121
What happened with Brad?

38:17.331 --> 38:20.425
His mom took him home.
She decided not to risk it.

38:21.468 --> 38:24.232
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Me too.

38:25.272 --> 38:28.969
I wouldn't have asked questions
if you'd told me what you were doing.

38:29.176 --> 38:32.475
I'm sorry that you thought
it was your business to ask me.

38:33.547 --> 38:35.208
What's going to happen?

38:35.716 --> 38:37.411
He's gonna die.

38:50.664 --> 38:55.260
Mark, I was putting together
a year-Iong ER coverage schedule.

38:55.469 --> 38:56.436
Good.

38:56.670 --> 38:57.932
Kerry, I want to talk to you.

38:59.506 --> 39:01.235
Is it about the Chief position?

39:02.409 --> 39:05.901
The executive committee has decided
to reopen the search.

39:09.450 --> 39:14.183
The committee feels that they need a
candidate with a national reputation.

39:14.989 --> 39:17.355
Personally, I think it stinks.

39:20.394 --> 39:23.056
Well, that's that.

39:23.364 --> 39:25.992
You're not out of the running, Kerry.

39:26.200 --> 39:29.169
- They just reopened the search.
- No.

39:29.370 --> 39:34.501
And I'm not interested
in continuing as Interim Chief.

39:34.708 --> 39:37.233
- Who's gonna do it?
- Not my problem.

39:38.479 --> 39:41.414
I shouldn't have yelled,
but he's so damn sensitive.

39:41.615 --> 39:43.708
Hold still, Marcus.

39:44.385 --> 39:46.353
Hey, welcome back.

39:46.553 --> 39:48.043
I hear I missed quite a trauma.

39:48.255 --> 39:49.882
You certainly did.

39:50.090 --> 39:53.355
It's all my fault.
Eddy was driving, and I upset him.

39:53.560 --> 39:56.120
I was just upstairs.
They finished the surgery.

39:56.330 --> 39:58.491
They repaired your brother's heart.

39:58.699 --> 40:00.690
Oh, thank God!

40:01.135 --> 40:04.127
It was Dr. Corday here
who freed him just in time.

40:05.272 --> 40:06.864
Well, that doesn't surprise me.

40:07.074 --> 40:09.133
She's an excellent doctor.

40:09.877 --> 40:12.846
When you're finished with Marcus,
we'll grab dinner.

40:13.047 --> 40:14.810
I beg your pardon?

40:15.015 --> 40:18.610
You're my new intern.
I just gave you an order.

40:20.020 --> 40:22.511
Would you excuse us for a moment?

40:24.325 --> 40:26.418
Peter, are you sure?

40:27.661 --> 40:29.026
Elizabeth, you're no intern.

40:30.030 --> 40:33.727
You'll still have to do scut work
and take call every third night.

40:33.934 --> 40:36.630
But you'll have your patients
and can operate.

40:37.204 --> 40:38.228
Thank you.

40:38.639 --> 40:41.233
Yeah, don't mention it.

40:41.442 --> 40:43.706
- I'll see you later.
- Aren't you on tonight?

40:44.945 --> 40:46.606
Yeah, I am.

40:55.155 --> 40:57.851
Sure you don't want something
to eat from Doc Magoo's?

40:58.058 --> 41:01.550
No, that's all right.
I got indigestion there at lunch.

41:02.563 --> 41:04.030
What are you doing?

41:04.465 --> 41:06.126
I opened my big mouth.

41:06.333 --> 41:10.269
I told Anspaugh that Pedes ER
was running at peak capacity.

41:10.471 --> 41:14.464
Now he wants me to give a detailed
analysis of the daily census.

41:15.008 --> 41:16.771
When will you be home?

41:17.611 --> 41:19.272
Around April.

41:19.913 --> 41:21.676
I won't wait up then.

41:21.982 --> 41:24.212
- Good night.
- Good night.

41:27.421 --> 41:30.083
Hey, doc, where are you headed?

41:30.591 --> 41:31.922
Home, you?

41:32.126 --> 41:33.787
To the firehouse, we're off duty.

41:33.994 --> 41:37.088
Listen, sorry I broke protocol
this morning.

41:37.998 --> 41:39.693
The adrenaline got the best of me.

41:39.900 --> 41:41.697
Happens to me in a couple of hours.

41:41.902 --> 41:42.994
My knees won't stop shaking.

41:44.138 --> 41:46.834
- You got any cash on you?
- I'm tapped out.

41:47.040 --> 41:49.406
Bunch of us are playing poker.
Want to come?

41:49.943 --> 41:52.741
- Sure.
- We'll stop by the Ready Teller.

41:52.946 --> 41:54.743
- Hop in.
- All right.

42:04.758 --> 42:06.316
What time do we have to beat?

42:06.660 --> 42:08.150
Six hours and 29 minutes.

42:08.362 --> 42:10.296
We're trying to set
a new world record.

42:10.497 --> 42:11.521
You're doing great.

42:11.732 --> 42:13.996
- Thanks for stepping in for Katie.
- My pleasure.

42:14.201 --> 42:17.136
Only six hours,
24 minutes to go, right?

42:32.352 --> 42:34.547
- Dr. Weaver.
- Carter?

42:35.823 --> 42:38.291
What are you doing here?

42:40.093 --> 42:43.995
I came to see about a room for rent.
Is this the right address?

42:45.799 --> 42:49.394
It is, I rent out my apartment.

42:49.603 --> 42:51.298
I have a basement.

42:53.874 --> 42:55.068
Would you like to see it?

42:56.910 --> 42:57.899
Sure.

42:58.712 --> 43:01.306
I don't usually advertise
at the hospital.

43:01.515 --> 43:05.815
I always thought it might be
kind of, you know, awkward.

43:07.588 --> 43:09.522
Sure, well, if you'd rather not.

43:10.257 --> 43:11.189
No.

43:13.427 --> 43:15.691
I was just having a drink.

43:17.998 --> 43:18.987
Would you like one?

43:22.035 --> 43:24.833
- Sure.
- Good, good.

43:31.378 --> 43:34.108
Did you do something to your hair?

43:38.485 --> 43:39.884
Hello?

43:40.921 --> 43:42.354
Hey, baby.

43:43.690 --> 43:45.681
Your census report?

43:45.893 --> 43:48.726
Yeah, I think it's
on the kitchen table.

43:49.830 --> 43:51.297
You want me to get it for you?

43:51.498 --> 43:55.434
No, I can do it. It's just gonna
take a minute, okay? Just hold on.

43:55.636 --> 43:58.833
Don't get out of the tub.
You look all happy.

43:59.039 --> 44:02.372
Doug, what are you doing here?

44:02.743 --> 44:05.371
I came to get this,
but then I was thinking...

44:05.979 --> 44:09.210
...that I was working
all night last night.

44:09.416 --> 44:10.474
You were.

44:11.051 --> 44:14.714
- And I'll be working all day tomorrow.
- Yeah.

44:14.922 --> 44:17.686
- Maybe I should take tonight off.
- That's a good idea.

44:17.891 --> 44:19.449
You like that?

44:23.864 --> 44:26.662
- What's that, a bubble bath?
- You want to come in?
