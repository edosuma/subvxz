(chuckles)
It's still pretty early.

01:13.500 --> 01:18.375

while I finish sleeping?

01:18.375 --> 01:21.166
(dogs giggling)

01:23.000 --> 01:24.416

-(crash)
-Whoa!

01:52.291 --> 01:54.166
You okay, Rolly?

01:54.166 --> 01:57.500
Yep.
I just wish my sticks
would stop spilling everywhere.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.000
If I could just get something
to put them in.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.458

for their breakfast
birthday bones?

02:11.333 --> 02:13.291
Maybe breakfast
will cheer us up.

02:14.750 --> 02:15.833
Thanks, Bob!

02:15.833 --> 02:18.333
And guess what?
When I get home
from work,

02:18.333 --> 02:21.250
we're gonna have our own
little puppy party!
Ha ha ha!

02:21.250 --> 02:22.458
-Wow!
-I can't wait!

02:22.458 --> 02:25.208
-(dogs barking)
-I'll see you tonight, pups!

02:25.208 --> 02:28.583
-(chewing)
-I'm glad we were born
on the same day,

02:28.583 --> 02:30.375
so we can be
birthday buddies!

02:30.375 --> 02:33.375
Yeah, we'll have double the fun
at our birthday party!

02:33.375 --> 02:35.208
(chewing)

02:35.208 --> 02:39.125
Ahh!
So... what gifts did you guys
get for each other?

02:39.125 --> 02:41.000
Bob said
he's giving us presents.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.458
Don't you wanna give something
to your brother, too?

02:43.458 --> 02:46.875
Of course.
I want you to have
the best birthday ever.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.166
Ditto!

02:48.166 --> 02:50.500
You know, you could
also make something,

02:50.500 --> 02:53.000
like a card, or a paw print
in clay.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.458
Perfect!
Except, we don't have
any markers.

02:56.458 --> 02:58.458
Or paper.
Or clay.

02:58.458 --> 03:00.583
Come on, Rolly.
We'd better start
our gift-mission

03:00.583 --> 03:02.458
if we're gonna be back
in time for our party.

03:02.458 --> 03:04.125

04:04.875 --> 04:07.500
Oh, yes!
ARF has many ideas!

-Oh! Hey! I need help

04:35.875 --> 04:37.583
thinking of a birthday present
for Bingo.

04:37.583 --> 04:40.375
Hmm! Mmm, ah!

04:40.375 --> 04:42.416
(mumbling)

04:42.416 --> 04:46.583

but I'm not sure what Bingo
would do with a mop.

do you have down there?

Quick!
Hide the gift!
Here comes Bingo!

04:55.958 --> 04:57.583

04:57.583 --> 04:59.208
-Hi, Tad!
-What's up?

04:59.208 --> 05:03.583
Ha-ha, I'm gonna
get you, feather!

05:03.583 --> 05:04.500
Ha-ha!

05:04.500 --> 05:06.583
Oh, love this thing.

05:06.583 --> 05:09.250
I found the perfect gift
for Rolly!

05:09.250 --> 05:10.500
And that is...?

05:10.500 --> 05:11.875
A stick!

05:11.875 --> 05:13.000
Rolly loves sticks!

05:13.000 --> 05:14.875
Hm.
Where'd you get it?

05:14.875 --> 05:16.125
Rolly's stick collection.

05:16.125 --> 05:19.083
(chuckles)
Bingo, that's not a present.

05:19.083 --> 05:20.458
It's already his.

05:20.458 --> 05:23.458
Why don't you
think about something
that Rolly doesn't have,

05:23.458 --> 05:25.291
but you think
he could use.

05:25.291 --> 05:29.083
Huh.
Today he wished he had someplace
to keep his sticks.

05:29.083 --> 05:30.833
Maybe I could find him
a stick holder!

05:30.833 --> 05:33.125
Oh, that sounds
like a great present.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.458
Thanks, Hissy!

05:35.958 --> 05:37.958
Presenting, Bingo's
birthday gift.

05:37.958 --> 05:41.083
Rolly,
that's Bingo's toy.

05:41.083 --> 05:42.708
Yeah!
That's how I know
he'll like it!

05:42.708 --> 05:47.250
Wow.
Okay, you can't give someone

05:47.250 --> 05:49.958
something
that's already theirs.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.500
Oh.
That makes it harder.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.333
But you know Bingo
better than anyone.

05:55.333 --> 05:57.000
What does he like?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.416
He used to like
his Captain Dog fetch toy

05:59.416 --> 06:01.875
until the launch pad broke.

06:01.875 --> 06:04.458
(gasp)
Hey! Maybe I can find him
something springy

06:04.458 --> 06:06.333
so his toy can fly again!

06:06.333 --> 06:07.500
Good idea!

06:07.500 --> 06:09.500
Now go find it,
so I can take a nap.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.583
All this advice-giving
is exhausting.

06:12.583 --> 06:13.458
Enjoy your nap!

06:15.875 --> 06:17.458
Thanks for letting me
get Rolly's present

06:17.458 --> 06:19.166
at your junkyard, Bulworth.

06:19.166 --> 06:20.625
No problem, kid.

06:20.625 --> 06:24.583
I got more containers
than I know what to do with.
Take your pick.

06:24.583 --> 06:27.333
(gasp)
It's perfect!

06:27.333 --> 06:30.500
Aren't you lookin' for somethin'
to hold lotsa sticks?

06:30.500 --> 06:31.875
Yeah, but it's blue!

06:31.875 --> 06:33.375
My favorite color!

06:33.375 --> 06:36.291
Yeah, but isn't it
supposed to be for Rolly?

06:36.291 --> 06:38.416
If I like it, he will, too.

06:38.416 --> 06:39.583
Thanks, Bulworth!

06:39.583 --> 06:41.708
Anytime, Bingo.

06:41.708 --> 06:45.500
Present for Bingo.
Present for Bingo.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.500
(gasp)
Hey, Jackie, I'm on a mission

06:48.500 --> 06:50.291
to find a birthday present
for Bingo.

06:50.291 --> 06:51.583
It needs to be springy.

06:51.583 --> 06:53.583
Springy, huh?

06:53.583 --> 06:55.625
I might have somethin'
like that.

06:55.625 --> 06:58.000
Perfect!
It's springy!

06:58.000 --> 06:59.125
And red!

06:59.125 --> 07:01.708
But red is your favorite color.

07:01.708 --> 07:04.125
Doesn't Bingo
like blue?

07:04.125 --> 07:07.000
He likes blue best,
but this is too good
to pass up.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.833
Jackie, you saved the day.

07:08.833 --> 07:10.166
The birth-day!

07:10.166 --> 07:12.291
Happy to help, buddy.

07:15.750 --> 07:17.583
Ahhh, too small.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.208
And Rolly likes red.

07:19.208 --> 07:22.000
Remember, it's not
for you, it's for Rolly.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.583
Right.
For Rolly.

07:24.875 --> 07:27.583
Oh... not springy enough.

07:27.583 --> 07:30.625
And it's red,
which is your favorite color.

07:30.625 --> 07:32.333
Presents should be thoughtful.

07:32.333 --> 07:35.000
Right.
Right, thoughtful.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.875
Thinking.
Thinking.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.625
What does Bingo like?

07:39.625 --> 07:40.750
(siren sounds)

07:40.750 --> 07:41.875
(gasp)

07:48.583 --> 07:51.000
Hey, Rolly,
how's it goin'?

07:51.000 --> 07:54.708
Okay.
I'm on a mission to find Bingo
the perfect birthday gift.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.708
(gasp)

07:56.708 --> 07:59.458
That spring!
It's just what I'm looking for!

07:59.458 --> 08:00.625
You have any extras?

08:00.625 --> 08:03.375
Mm, no, sorry.
I'd give you that one,

08:03.375 --> 08:06.333
but I need to prop up
the front of my dog house.

08:06.333 --> 08:08.416
If I can trade you
something else that will work,

08:08.416 --> 08:09.625
can I have your spring
for Bingo?

08:09.625 --> 08:12.833
Sure.
If you got something
that'll get the job done,

08:12.833 --> 08:14.500
I'd be happy to trade you.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.708
Yay!

08:17.708 --> 08:20.166
Faster, Rufus, faster!

08:20.166 --> 08:21.833
What are you doing
with that box?

08:21.833 --> 08:24.750
Pretending
it's a car, obviously!

08:24.750 --> 08:27.958
I'm looking for a box
just like that for Rolly's
birthday present.

08:27.958 --> 08:30.708
You're barkin' up
the wrong tree, Bingo.

08:30.708 --> 08:33.500
Unless you can trade me
something even better,

08:33.500 --> 08:35.958
you're never gonna get your paws
on this thing.

08:35.958 --> 08:38.083
I think I can trade you
for something better.

08:38.083 --> 08:39.291
I'll be back.

08:43.875 --> 08:45.708
(barking)

08:45.708 --> 08:47.958
Hey, thanks, Rolly.

08:47.958 --> 08:50.833
You know, those sticks
work even better
than the spring.

08:50.833 --> 08:52.458
Thanks for helping me
give my brother

08:52.458 --> 08:53.583
the best-ever present.

08:55.708 --> 08:58.583
Bye, Stickster.
Bye, Woodsman.

08:58.583 --> 09:00.625
Bye, Leafless.
I'll miss you all.

09:00.625 --> 09:05.708
You sure you wanna trade?
Seems like you really love
those sticks.

09:05.708 --> 09:08.083
Yeah, but not as much
as I love my brother.

09:08.083 --> 09:10.875
See ya, Dallie.
I have a present to wrap.

09:10.875 --> 09:13.875
And if you see Bingo,
don't tell him!

09:13.875 --> 09:15.333
Cupcake:
Whatever you brought

09:15.333 --> 09:17.875
better be really great
or no deal.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.875
Hey, what's that?

09:19.875 --> 09:21.750
Oh, how'd that get in there?

09:21.750 --> 09:23.750
That's what I want.

09:23.750 --> 09:27.750
Okay.
For Rolly... I'll trade.

09:27.750 --> 09:31.000
You can have the old box.
We didn't want it anyway.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.250
Uh-huh.

09:32.250 --> 09:35.000
Rolly's gonna be
so excited when
he sees this.

09:37.375 --> 09:39.875
Looks like
our present-getting mission
is complete.

09:39.875 --> 09:41.750
-Bingo: I can't take it!
-Rolly: Let's open 'em now!

09:41.750 --> 09:42.875
Open yours first!

09:42.875 --> 09:44.458
You're gonna be,
like, "Bow-wow!"

09:44.458 --> 09:45.833
No-- No, you go first!

09:45.833 --> 09:48.000
Your face is gonna be,
like, mmmmmm!

09:48.000 --> 09:51.625
For goodness sakes,
open them at the same time!

09:53.875 --> 09:55.750
Wow, a box!

09:55.750 --> 09:57.000
Is it for hide and seek?

09:57.000 --> 09:58.125
Uhh!

09:59.458 --> 10:03.000
-Oh.
-It's a spring to launch
your Captain Dog action figure.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.166
Oh.
It is.
Thanks, Rolly.

10:07.166 --> 10:08.708
Yours is a stick holder!

10:10.083 --> 10:12.250
For your stick collection!

10:12.250 --> 10:13.958
That's so thoughtful.

10:13.958 --> 10:14.708
Thanks.

10:14.708 --> 10:16.291
What are you waiting for?

10:16.291 --> 10:17.458
Try it out!

10:17.458 --> 10:18.583
Put your sticks in there!

10:18.583 --> 10:20.458
The thing is, uh--

10:20.458 --> 10:21.875
I don't have them anymore.

10:21.875 --> 10:23.291
What do you mean?

10:23.291 --> 10:27.375
I traded my stick collection
to Dallie for that spring.

10:27.375 --> 10:28.833
You did that for me?

10:28.833 --> 10:33.500
Yeah.
So come on, let's use the spring
to launch Captain Dog!

10:33.500 --> 10:35.708
Oh... we can't.

10:35.708 --> 10:37.958
-Why not?
-Because I traded my Captain Dog

10:37.958 --> 10:40.000
to Cupcake for your present.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.833
But Captain Dog
is your favorite toy.

10:42.833 --> 10:44.708
Yeah, but,
you're my brother.

10:44.708 --> 10:46.625
You're more important
than a toy.

10:46.625 --> 10:50.500
But aren't you guys
sad you don't have
your stuff anymore?

10:50.500 --> 10:51.833
(both whimper)

10:51.833 --> 10:53.958
Yeah, but I do have
a brother who traded

10:53.958 --> 10:56.458
his most favorite thing
to make me happy.

10:56.458 --> 10:57.958
And that's better
than any present

10:57.958 --> 10:59.500
I can think of, anyway.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.583
I'm home, birthday boys.

11:01.583 --> 11:03.125
Who's ready for a party?

11:03.125 --> 11:06.458
-(dogs barking)
-Hey, I've got some, uh,

11:06.458 --> 11:08.875
boring cat business
to take care of.

11:08.875 --> 11:10.125
I'll be back.

11:10.125 --> 11:12.708
Rolly/Bingo:
Huh-- Uh-- Uh! Uh!

11:12.708 --> 11:14.875
I hope you like your presents.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.875
I knitted them myself.

11:16.875 --> 11:19.333
-We love 'em, Bob!
-Thank you so much!

11:19.333 --> 11:22.875
Yeah, Hissy was right.
Handmade gifts are great.

11:22.875 --> 11:24.833
Hey, where is Hissy?

11:24.833 --> 11:26.000
(mouth full)
I'm right here.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.875
(grunts) Here.

11:27.875 --> 11:30.125
Happy Birthday!

11:30.125 --> 11:32.000
-My stick collection!
-My Captain Dog!

11:32.000 --> 11:33.958
Rolly:
Yeah! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

11:33.958 --> 11:35.583
How did you get
our stuff back?

11:37.625 --> 11:40.750
Wow.
I see why cats
like these things.

11:40.750 --> 11:43.875
Rolly's gonna be really happy
to see his stick collection.

11:43.875 --> 11:47.083
I hope so.
But I've got
one more stop to make.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.750
(mouth full)
Who wants to trade a Captain Dog
for a pretty feather?

11:49.750 --> 11:51.458
I'll trade!
I'll trade!

11:51.458 --> 11:54.083
(excited laughter)

11:54.083 --> 11:56.208
That was easier than I thought.

11:56.208 --> 11:59.458
Just made a couple trades.

11:59.458 --> 12:01.166
(chuckles)
Don't worry about it.

12:01.166 --> 12:04.208
-Bingo: Thank you!
-Rolly: You're the best
kitty sister in the whole world!

12:04.208 --> 12:06.708
I know.
Don't rub it in.

12:06.708 --> 12:09.250
The sticks fit perfectly!

12:09.250 --> 12:11.125
And Captain Dog
flies again!

12:11.125 --> 12:14.000
Captain Dog's voice:
Captain Dog, launch!

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Happy Birthday, brothers.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.958
(dogs giggling)

12:23.000 --> 12:25.458
Bingo/Rolly speak:

12:25.458 --> 12:29.875
(dogs giggling)

12:29.875 --> 12:31.958
Bingo! Rolly!
Come on!

12:31.958 --> 12:34.708
Bring the stick back, boys!

12:34.708 --> 12:38.833
All right.
One more, then I gotta go home
and get ready for work.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.125
Whoa!

12:41.125 --> 12:42.416
Hi, Gina.

12:42.416 --> 12:44.000
(giggles)
Hi, Bob.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.125
(barking)

12:45.125 --> 12:47.708
-Hey!
It's baby!
-Hi, Baby!

12:47.708 --> 12:49.583
(panting, barking)

12:49.583 --> 12:52.416
(giggles)
Hey, I'll see you
at the dance contest.

12:52.416 --> 12:54.333
It starts at eight.
Don't forget!

12:54.333 --> 12:59.375
Well, I'd never forget
about the dance contest tonight.

12:59.375 --> 13:03.208
I totally forgot
about the dance contest tonight!

13:03.208 --> 13:06.000
I was supposed to come up
with a dance to perform,

13:06.000 --> 13:07.875
but I didn't even learn
how to dance!

13:07.875 --> 13:09.500
And now there's no time!

13:09.500 --> 13:11.750
I've gotta take you home
and go to work!

13:11.750 --> 13:14.000
Oh, how frustrating!

13:14.000 --> 13:16.583
Let me untangle these
and then we'll go.

13:18.166 --> 13:20.083
-Ha-ha!
-(dogs giggle)

13:21.125 --> 13:23.125
Almost got it!

13:23.125 --> 13:24.708
This oughta do it! Huh--

13:24.708 --> 13:27.291
(sniffs)
Rolly, do you smell that?

13:27.291 --> 13:28.583
Is it me?

13:28.583 --> 13:30.875
No, silly, it's a mission!

13:30.875 --> 13:33.458
Whoa!
Whoa-whoa, whoa!

13:33.458 --> 13:36.875
Bob's gotta learn
to dance, and we gotta
teach him!

13:36.875 --> 13:39.333
It'll be easy.
I'll show him
my best moves!

13:39.333 --> 13:40.625
Shake, shake, shake.

13:40.625 --> 13:42.416
Bob's gonna love that!

13:42.416 --> 13:44.375
What do you think
you're doing?

13:44.375 --> 13:47.458
I'm dancing the way
I'm gonna dance
when I teach Bob.

13:47.458 --> 13:49.750
Ha!
You call that dancing?

13:49.750 --> 13:51.083
Uh, yes?

13:51.083 --> 13:52.875
That's not dancing!

13:52.875 --> 13:55.750
Really?
I thought that was dancing.

13:55.750 --> 13:58.708
That's just tail wiggling,
right, Rufus?

13:58.708 --> 13:59.875
Huh?

13:59.875 --> 14:01.833
Rufus!
Uh-huh.

14:01.833 --> 14:04.416
I guess I never
saw dancing before.
Me neither.

14:04.416 --> 14:06.208
Well, I've seen lots of dancing,

14:06.208 --> 14:09.166
and let me tell you somethin',
that's not it!

14:09.166 --> 14:13.000
Come on, Rufus!
Let's go someplace
with less tail wiggling

14:13.000 --> 14:14.875
and less puppies!

14:14.875 --> 14:16.958
(chuckles)

14:16.958 --> 14:18.833
-Rufus!
-(panting)

14:18.833 --> 14:21.708
Maybe Cupcake's right.
Maybe we can't dance.

14:21.708 --> 14:23.875
Yet.
So we'll just have to learn!

14:23.875 --> 14:26.833
And then we can help Bob learn
in time for the competition.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.875
-Bob:
Ha! Got it!
-(gasp)

14:30.083 --> 14:31.208
Good enough.

14:31.208 --> 14:34.458
(dogs barking)

14:34.458 --> 14:37.625
Dancing: To move one's body
or feet to music.

14:37.625 --> 14:40.458
To boogie, to bop,
to get one's groove on.

14:40.458 --> 14:44.208
Dancing often includes
twirling, jumping,
and moving your feet.

14:44.208 --> 14:47.250
Twirling, jumping,
moving your feet.
Got it!

14:47.250 --> 14:49.125
Here is an example
of dancing.

14:49.125 --> 14:53.875
(disco music playing)

14:58.166 --> 15:00.833
I'm tired just watching him.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.625
ARF is the twirliest twirler
I ever saw.

15:03.625 --> 15:05.208
It's makin' me kinda dizzy.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.708
-So if we're gonna
learn to dance,
-(Rolly falls down)

15:06.708 --> 15:08.875
-Rolly: I'm good!
-we need to learn
to twirl, and jump,

15:08.875 --> 15:10.250
and move our feet!

15:10.250 --> 15:12.208
Well, I got your twirling
right here!

15:12.208 --> 15:13.333
-Easy!
-Watch out!

15:13.333 --> 15:14.958
-Ooh--
-(all grunting)

15:14.958 --> 15:16.833
Okay, so maybe not that easy.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.375
I might know just the place
where we can learn to twirl!

15:19.375 --> 15:21.208
ARF, we're gonna
need your help.

15:21.208 --> 15:23.208
Yes!
Oh, yes!

15:24.125 --> 15:25.708
(crash)

15:25.708 --> 15:28.250
ARF:
Whoopsie!

15:28.250 --> 15:29.833
Let us boogie!

15:29.833 --> 15:30.958
Bingo/Rolly:

the merry-go-round, ARF!

16:19.583 --> 16:22.125
Look, Bingo!
I'm twirling!

16:22.125 --> 16:23.333
It's working!

16:23.333 --> 16:26.125
Whoa, but the world's
twirling, too!

16:26.125 --> 16:27.333
Bingo/Rolly:
Oof!

16:27.333 --> 16:28.375
I'm definitely twirling,

16:28.375 --> 16:30.333
but this doesn't look
a whole lot like dancing.

16:30.333 --> 16:33.500
Maybe that's
because we're not jumping
and moving our feet, too.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.458
Dance Instructor:
Come on, class,
move your feet!

16:36.583 --> 16:38.708
Of course, we have the jump,

16:38.708 --> 16:40.000
and the twirl.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.875
But dancing is about
so much more than that.

16:42.875 --> 16:44.333
I knew it!

16:44.333 --> 16:46.208
Allow me to demonstrate.

They're already pretty good.

17:06.291 --> 17:08.375
So, how do we learn?

We're great at having fun!

18:37.000 --> 18:39.708
Yeah, but we still look
just like we did this morning,

18:39.708 --> 18:41.875
and Cupcake said
that wasn't dancing.

18:41.875 --> 18:43.833
It sure looks like
you're dancin' to me.

18:43.833 --> 18:46.583
And we are having
a really good time.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.416
That's the whole point!

18:48.416 --> 18:50.083
Let's give it one more shot!

18:50.083 --> 18:52.458
All right, class.
Don't be shy.

18:52.458 --> 18:55.875
(disco music playing)

18:57.708 --> 19:01.000
(gasp)
This is my favorite song!

19:01.000 --> 19:02.958
You gotta really twirl it!

19:02.958 --> 19:04.500
Really jump it!

19:04.500 --> 19:08.000
And-- Oh yeah! Dancin'!

19:08.000 --> 19:10.333
Ooh!

19:10.333 --> 19:11.458
Ha-ha!

19:11.458 --> 19:13.000
(Bingo/Rolly giggling)

19:13.000 --> 19:14.833
Nice moves, Hedgie.

19:14.833 --> 19:18.000
(laughs)
What is that hedgehog doing?

19:18.000 --> 19:19.250
He's dancing!

19:19.250 --> 19:20.416
Doesn't he look great?

19:20.416 --> 19:23.958
He's not dancing,
he's just shaking his quills!

19:23.958 --> 19:28.291
-But he's having fun!
-So? He still looks
pretty silly to me.

19:28.291 --> 19:32.583
