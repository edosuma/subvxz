<i>(male narrator)</i>
<i>Every day is a happy day,</i>
<i>when you drink Happy Beer.</i>

00:14.291 --> 00:16.417
<i>Happy Beer uses</i>
<i>the peppiest malts and</i>
<i>barley</i>

00:16.500 --> 00:18.083
<i>to make you</i>
<i>feel cheerful inside.</i>

00:18.166 --> 00:19.750
<i>It's the flavor</i>
<i>for dancing and romancing.</i>

00:19.834 --> 00:21.667
(female #1)
'Yeah, well, that
shouldn't be a problem.'

00:21.750 --> 00:25.417
Hawk, will you play "Summertime
Blues" for us tonight?

00:25.500 --> 00:28.500
Think I can fit that in.

00:28.583 --> 00:30.208
You know, I listen
to you in bed

00:30.291 --> 00:31.750
before I go to sleep.

00:31.834 --> 00:33.917
(female #2)
'Your voice feels so close.'

00:34.000 --> 00:36.542
Like...you're
in bed with
me.

00:36.625 --> 00:38.834
- What's your name, darlin'?
- Gloria.

00:38.917 --> 00:40.959
(man on radio)
...before you know it.
So be prepared.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.500
'Buy a Hagen Billy
heater right now.'

00:42.583 --> 00:44.333
(Hawk)
'Here you are.'

00:44.417 --> 00:46.166
Hope you have
sweet dreams tonight, Gloria.

00:53.583 --> 00:54.959
Mic's starting
to pick that up, Bones.

00:55.041 --> 00:57.250
Yeah, I called
maintenance 50 times.

00:57.333 --> 00:59.041
Sorry, about that,
Hawk. I'm on it.

00:59.125 --> 01:01.709
Alright. You got
something for me?

01:01.792 --> 01:02.792
Yeah.

01:04.083 --> 01:06.208
Check out the latest
Roy Hamilton single.

01:06.291 --> 01:08.125
(Bones)
'Sounds like it's in 3D.'

01:08.208 --> 01:10.208
Yeah, heard about that
new thing called stereo.

01:10.291 --> 01:11.333
You gonna play it, Hawk?

01:11.417 --> 01:12.625
Only if I like it.

01:12.709 --> 01:14.709
Oh, it's smokin', Hawk.

01:14.792 --> 01:16.000
Some day, I'm gonna
buy a Gibson guitar

01:16.083 --> 01:17.250
just like the one
in that song.

01:17.333 --> 01:21.000
Alright, hold on, Elvis.
Let's get to work.

01:28.250 --> 01:29.709
Hey, hey, Philly.

01:29.792 --> 01:31.750
It's your cool
rockin' daddy The Hawk.

01:31.834 --> 01:35.917
Comin' at you live on WIXA,
can you hear the sound,
Philly?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.125
I heard it last night
at the Locust Club.

01:38.208 --> 01:40.166
It was doing funny things
to the people.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.458
It made their bodies sweat,
made their hips shake.

01:42.542 --> 01:44.834
I want you to
turn it up, Philly!

01:44.917 --> 01:46.166
I want you
to turn up that

01:46.250 --> 01:48.667
rock and roll music!

01:48.750 --> 01:50.000
You're dialed into the Hawk

01:50.083 --> 01:54.250
and this is Gene Vincent
with "Say Mama!"

01:54.333 --> 01:56.583
Ow!

02:25.458 --> 02:27.792
(Hawk on radio)
'Let's slow it down for
a sec for a little ballad'

02:27.875 --> 02:30.875
'called "Scarlet Rose."'

03:45.417 --> 03:49.667
A filmmaker doing a documentary
on '50s rock DJ John Hawkins.

03:49.750 --> 03:51.625
Oh, The Hawk?

03:51.709 --> 03:53.709
My mom used to go
to his sock hops.

03:53.792 --> 03:55.291
Said he was pretty wild.

03:55.375 --> 03:57.959
Late '50s were
a crazy time to be a kid.

03:58.041 --> 03:59.583
You a rocker, boss?

03:59.667 --> 04:00.750
I had a radio.

04:00.834 --> 04:03.625
Detective Rush,
this is Tom Bergin.

04:03.709 --> 04:05.083
Tom's been looking
at a tape recording

04:05.166 --> 04:07.125
that began
seconds after Hawkins died.

04:07.208 --> 04:08.458
(Lilly)
'Uh, didn't Hawkins..'

04:08.542 --> 04:10.834
Yeah, comb his hair
with
a .38 live on the air?

04:10.917 --> 04:13.583
So they thought, apparently
as Hawkins slumped over

04:13.667 --> 04:15.125
his hand hit
a control that started

04:15.208 --> 04:16.667
an in-studio tape recorder.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.041
He taped his shows?

04:18.125 --> 04:19.333
Yeah, for reruns.

04:19.417 --> 04:20.792
And no one's heard this before?

04:20.875 --> 04:23.417
Years ago, but no one's
heard what I've heard.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.166
(Tom)
'No one had this equipment.'

04:25.250 --> 04:27.083
- This thing ready yet?
- One sec.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.125
First, I had the tape

04:28.208 --> 04:29.291
transferred on M-audio and then

04:29.375 --> 04:30.500
'I flipped it to Logic Pro'

04:30.583 --> 04:31.667
'because it
totally leverages'

04:31.750 --> 04:34.125
'the new Mac PCI-DSP card.'

04:34.208 --> 04:36.000
(Nick)
'Hey, guy.'

04:36.083 --> 04:38.875
No one understands
a word you're saying.

04:38.959 --> 04:41.875
Right, right.

04:41.959 --> 04:43.208
Here we go.

04:43.291 --> 04:45.500
Uh, this is right
after the gunshot.

04:45.583 --> 04:47.291
I'm gonna lower
the sound of the record.

04:47.375 --> 04:50.417
All you'll hear is
the ambience in the DJ booth.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.041
Footsteps?

05:00.125 --> 05:02.041
Hawkins wasn't in there alone.

05:03.917 --> 05:06.291
Could be a door,
someone leaving?

05:06.375 --> 05:09.959
Then it's quiet for 30
minutes
until the janitor ran in.

05:11.792 --> 05:13.625
So either Hawkins
woke from the dead

05:13.709 --> 05:14.917
and walked out of there.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.166
Or his murderer did.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.583
(Scotty)
'Hawkins got top billing
over the musicians?'

06:02.667 --> 06:05.083
Radio DJs were as big
as the rock stars.

06:05.166 --> 06:06.583
It was, Alan Freed in New York

06:06.667 --> 06:09.417
Wolfman Jack in LA
and The Hawk, here in Philly.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.959
(Scotty)
'Can't even name
a DJ on the air now.'

06:12.041 --> 06:14.583
Oh, back then they were
the tastemakers, Scotty.

06:14.667 --> 06:17.583
They picked the songs,
made or broke careers.

06:17.667 --> 06:20.959
Hawk could've been the target
of some wannabe rock star.

06:21.041 --> 06:24.542
Or some record company suit,
that was the time of payola.

06:24.625 --> 06:28.125
DJ's taking bribes from record
companies to play songs.

06:28.208 --> 06:31.083
(Will)
'Far as we know,
Hawk never took any payouts.'

06:31.166 --> 06:33.000
Real fan of the music,
wasn't afraid to play

06:33.083 --> 06:35.125
black artists
to white teens.

06:35.208 --> 06:36.250
Well, you a fan?

06:36.333 --> 06:39.750
Nah. I like country music.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.667
Country?

06:41.750 --> 06:43.792
Yeah, I DJ'd in college.

06:43.875 --> 06:46.250
This is Will Jeffries
coming at you live.

06:46.333 --> 06:48.166
(Will)
'Here's Hank Williams with'

06:48.250 --> 06:50.125
"My Son Calls
Another Man Daddy."

06:52.166 --> 06:53.792
You know, just when you
think you know someone.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.667
Now, the '58 theory was suicide.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.333
That looks self-inflicted.

07:00.417 --> 07:02.750
They didn't have our
forensics back then.

07:02.834 --> 07:04.667
Divorced at 24.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.250
Ex-wife inherited his money.

07:06.333 --> 07:07.959
(Will)
'Good motive, except that..'

07:08.041 --> 07:09.542
...he was broke.

07:09.625 --> 07:10.667
Maybe she found out
after the fact.

07:10.750 --> 07:11.834
Even if she's not the doer

07:11.917 --> 07:13.083
'first wives know all the dirt.'

07:16.250 --> 07:17.417
Excuse me.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.709
Hey, Ally,
everything
okay?

07:26.792 --> 07:28.125
I don't know.

07:28.208 --> 07:29.750
It's your brother.

07:29.834 --> 07:32.000
- He's stopped going to work.
- What?

07:32.083 --> 07:34.208
Mike's been in bed
for three days straight.

07:34.291 --> 07:35.500
So he's sick?

07:35.583 --> 07:37.125
Not according
to the doctor.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.458
He hasn't been the same

07:40.542 --> 07:42.375
since that day you came over.

07:42.458 --> 07:43.750
What are you, what
are
you talking about?

07:43.834 --> 07:45.041
What'd you say
to him, Scotty?

07:45.125 --> 07:47.208
Nothing. We-we were
just talking.

07:50.834 --> 07:52.959
I'm scared, okay?

07:53.041 --> 07:54.375
He sleeps all day.

07:54.458 --> 07:56.750
At night, he wanders
around the house like a ghost.

07:56.834 --> 08:00.875
Okay, listen,
I'll stop by
today.

08:00.959 --> 08:02.041
Okay.

08:02.125 --> 08:03.500
Mike will be fine.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.166
We married young.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.750
He was a free spirit.

08:14.834 --> 08:17.709
I wanted kids,
a simple quiet life

08:17.792 --> 08:19.333
and he wanted..

08:19.417 --> 08:20.542
To rock and roll?

08:21.959 --> 08:23.083
My father was
a musician.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.583
And I, I knew firsthand

08:24.667 --> 08:27.375
how tough a show
business life could
be.

08:27.458 --> 08:30.208
Did you stay in touch
with your ex-husband much?

08:30.291 --> 08:31.750
Goodness, no.

08:31.834 --> 08:34.458
I remarried,
started a
family.

08:34.542 --> 08:37.208
I didn't want the
likes
of John around.

08:37.291 --> 08:39.667
Where were you the night
he was shot, Dottie?

08:39.750 --> 08:40.750
Oh, really, now.

08:40.834 --> 08:42.625
I was at home with my family.

08:42.709 --> 08:44.375
When did you last see John?

08:44.458 --> 08:45.625
Oh..

08:45.709 --> 08:47.917
A month before he died.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.500
Thirteen years since
I'd last seen him.

08:50.583 --> 08:51.792
I was selling our house.

08:51.875 --> 08:52.959
He agree to that?

08:53.041 --> 08:54.208
(Dottie)
'Mm.'

08:54.291 --> 08:56.709
It was bought
with my money but, uh, back
then

08:56.792 --> 09:00.834
a woman could only get
a loan if a man cosigned.

09:00.917 --> 09:02.208
Different times.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.959
How was John
when you saw him?

09:06.041 --> 09:07.625
Same as always.

09:07.709 --> 09:10.625
In the middle of a mess.

09:10.709 --> 09:13.792
(Hawk)
That's right, kids,
Zip Toothpaste!

09:13.875 --> 09:15.583
Keep your smile hip.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.709
Brush with Zip.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.792
- How you been, Dot?
- Good.

09:29.875 --> 09:32.166
- You know, when you called--
- Just sign the bottom, John.

09:39.375 --> 09:41.083
- How's the family?
- Everyone's fine.

09:45.583 --> 09:47.417
You know, I heard a record
by your dad the other day.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.458
He sound like
a drunken fool?

09:51.542 --> 09:54.000
No, sounded like
a great bass player.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.333
You promised to play
the song I wrote, Hawk!

09:56.417 --> 09:58.125
- What the hell happened?
- 'You been drinking?'

09:58.208 --> 10:01.166
I had a bunch of
friends and this
girl

10:01.250 --> 10:02.875
Sally from
the roller
rink

10:02.959 --> 10:05.208
they were all at the
drive-in, tuned into the show

10:05.291 --> 10:06.542
waiting to hear my song.

10:06.625 --> 10:09.041
- "Belly Button Rock?"
- Yeah, that's it,

10:09.125 --> 10:11.583
- What happened?
- I listened to it.

10:11.667 --> 10:14.000
- And?
- It's not so hot, Bones.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.458
You saying I got no talent?

10:15.542 --> 10:17.875
No. I'm saying
I only play what I like.

10:17.959 --> 10:19.000
Baloney sandwich, Hawk.

10:19.083 --> 10:20.208
You play whatever

10:20.291 --> 10:22.000
the record company
pays you to play.

10:22.083 --> 10:24.625
You know that
is not true.

10:24.709 --> 10:26.667
How 'bout I get
my dad to buy you

10:26.750 --> 10:30.625
one of them new Skylarks, huh?
You play my song then, Hawk?

10:30.709 --> 10:33.000
I'm not for sale.
I never was. I never will
be.

10:33.083 --> 10:35.000
I'm sorry you had
to see this, Dottie.

10:35.083 --> 10:37.667
But I told Sally
I'd be on the
radio.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.792
I'd do anything for you,
Bones, anything to help you

10:39.875 --> 10:42.291
but you know how I am
about the music, right?

10:42.375 --> 10:44.208
- Right?
- Yeah.

10:44.291 --> 10:45.875
Alright,
then.
Go on, now.

10:45.959 --> 10:48.542
Sally will still dig you.
Rock and roll star or not.

10:55.792 --> 10:57.542
Better lock up that
gun of yours, Hawk.

10:57.625 --> 10:58.667
Excuse me?

10:58.750 --> 10:59.917
You never know
who could get to it.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.166
Is that a threat, buddy?

11:02.250 --> 11:04.625
Can't keep stomping on
people's dreams all the time

11:04.709 --> 11:06.208
and get away with it.

11:10.917 --> 11:12.583
(Will)
'Whose gun was that?'

11:12.667 --> 11:13.750
John's.

11:13.834 --> 11:15.750
Always kept it at work.

11:15.834 --> 11:17.500
So many crazies
out there.

11:19.083 --> 11:20.834
Sounds like, Bones,
was one of them.

11:32.542 --> 11:36.583
(Nick)
'Heard you had a meltdown
with your boss, The Hawk.'

11:36.667 --> 11:38.500
I had dreams.

11:38.583 --> 11:41.458
Thought Hawk didn't
appreciate the next
Elvis.

11:41.542 --> 11:44.250
Huh, maybe
you found his gun..

11:44.333 --> 11:46.542
..made him appreciate you.

11:46.625 --> 11:50.208
Came back the next day, hat
in hand, and Hawk forgave me.

11:50.291 --> 11:52.250
You were at the station
the night he was killed.

11:52.333 --> 11:55.917
I was, uh, DJing a party
that night, so I left.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.458
Plenty of witnesses.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.625
Well, the truth is,
his career advice

12:00.709 --> 12:02.917
saved me from years of futility.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.083
Your songs were that bad?

12:05.166 --> 12:06.959
Terrible.

12:07.041 --> 12:09.667
But I could still recognize
talent in others.

12:09.750 --> 12:12.625
- Built a career on that.
- Congratulations.

12:12.709 --> 12:16.625
Yeah, I learned what music
really was from Hawk.

12:17.709 --> 12:19.667
One in a million that guy.

12:19.750 --> 12:22.458
Think of anyone
who'd want to hurt him?

12:22.542 --> 12:23.792
Well..

12:23.875 --> 12:27.709
...lot of people
didn't care for him, sure

12:27.792 --> 12:29.667
but one guy had
more than a..

12:29.750 --> 12:31.834
...garden-variety
beef with him.

12:43.417 --> 12:44.458
You feel that beat?

12:45.625 --> 12:47.166
Now when this
song kicks in

12:47.250 --> 12:49.667
I want you kids to shake it.

12:52.041 --> 12:53.208
Can you shake it?

12:54.750 --> 12:56.834
No, no, no.
I don't think you heard me.

12:56.917 --> 12:59.834
shake

13:01.917 --> 13:05.333
Well, alright! Let's go!

13:34.875 --> 13:35.834
Thanks, man.

13:35.917 --> 13:38.709
(male #1)
'Hey, Hawkins?'

13:38.792 --> 13:41.542
- Your mama colored?
- Come again?

13:41.625 --> 13:43.542
I figure she must be,
you like playing this

13:43.625 --> 13:44.959
jumpity-squawk so much.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.000
It's rock and roll.

13:46.083 --> 13:47.291
Why don't you take the stick

13:47.375 --> 13:49.083
out of your tail
and enjoy the beat.

13:49.166 --> 13:50.333
Carli Chester.

13:50.417 --> 13:51.583
You recall that name?

13:51.667 --> 13:53.250
No. Should I?

13:53.333 --> 13:56.583
She's one of the girls you got
out there dancing like a whore.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.625
Take a look, mister,
those kids are alive

13:58.709 --> 14:00.041
''cause they can
feel the music.'

14:00.125 --> 14:04.041
Carli is 16 years old,
she's my little girl.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.917
- And she's in trouble.
- Trouble?

14:07.000 --> 14:09.667
Month ago she went
to one of your sock
hops.

14:09.750 --> 14:12.250
Says she met you
at a party
afterwards.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.709
I meet a lot of fans.

14:13.792 --> 14:16.417
You did more than
meet my daughter.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.542
I'm afraid you've
been misinformed.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.083
You calling
my little girl a
liar, sir?

14:21.166 --> 14:22.542
No, but I'm not the father.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.750
You either take
responsibility

14:24.834 --> 14:27.250
or I'm gonna fit
you for a pine-jacket.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.125
Understand me, buster?

14:33.125 --> 14:35.417
- Turn it up, Bones.
- You got it, Hawk!

14:40.333 --> 14:43.291
Teenyboppers always
love

14:43.375 --> 14:46.250
Sounds like he
did some lovin' back.

14:46.333 --> 14:47.959
Kind that gets
you arrested.

14:48.041 --> 14:50.000
Or shot in
the head with a .38.

15:01.625 --> 15:05.125
You recall a rock DJ
known as The Hawk, Lloyd?

15:05.208 --> 15:06.959
Never did care
for that kind of music.

15:07.041 --> 15:10.333
He got your daughter
pregnant back in '58.

15:10.417 --> 15:12.917
- I was wrong about that.
- How so?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.208
My daughter lied.

15:15.291 --> 15:17.291
It was her moron boyfriend

15:17.375 --> 15:21.375
who's now my
moron
son-in-law.

15:21.458 --> 15:24.417
Thought Hawkins
killed himself.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.667
He was murdered.

15:26.750 --> 15:29.000
- Not surprised to hear it.
- That right?

15:29.083 --> 15:32.250
I saw him in a neighborhood
diner time to time.

15:32.333 --> 15:34.417
Two ships passing
in the night.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.166
You want to elaborate?

15:37.250 --> 15:39.458
A few months before he died

15:39.542 --> 15:43.834
I took my family to breakfast
before, Sunday services.

15:43.917 --> 15:45.458
He was there.

15:45.542 --> 15:47.166
Coming off of a late night?

15:47.250 --> 15:49.291
And getting into trouble
with a young girl again.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.709
(female #3)
You know what they say
about a racetrack?

16:07.792 --> 16:10.250
It's a place where
windows clean people.

16:10.333 --> 16:11.542
That right?

16:13.125 --> 16:15.000
You look familiar.
Have we met?

16:15.083 --> 16:16.875
On the radio.

16:16.959 --> 16:18.000
I'm your number one fan.

16:18.083 --> 16:20.000
You can call me Jenny.

16:20.083 --> 16:22.291
Jenny. It's
a nice name.

16:24.041 --> 16:25.250
People said
you come here a lot.

16:25.333 --> 16:26.959
I hope I'm not
bothering you.

16:27.041 --> 16:28.875
Not at all, kid.

16:28.959 --> 16:31.500
Will you play "My Kind of
Dream"
for me tonight?

16:31.583 --> 16:32.792
Sure.

16:35.792 --> 16:37.542
What's your kind
of dream, Jenny?

16:37.625 --> 16:38.667
Gettin' out of this town.

16:38.750 --> 16:40.375
- Goin' where?
- Anywhere.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.583
It's a nice
place anywhere.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.375
I've been there
myself many times.

16:43.458 --> 16:45.458
It's got to be better
than secretarial school.

16:47.458 --> 16:48.875
That so bad?

16:48.959 --> 16:51.166
It's a train ride
to Squaresville.

16:51.250 --> 16:53.792
See, I want to be a singer.

16:53.875 --> 16:55.750
Get in line.
That's a hard
dream.

16:55.834 --> 16:56.917
But it's mine.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.583
People in line
aren't my problem.

16:58.667 --> 17:00.417
You sure are feisty, Jenny.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.709
Born that way.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.500
What the hell
you doing with gramps?

17:06.583 --> 17:08.250
(Jenny)
None of your business, Skiz.

17:08.333 --> 17:09.792
<i>now.</i>
- Get off of me.

17:09.875 --> 17:11.166
Just take a walk?

17:11.250 --> 17:12.500
(Hawk)
'Cool off.'

17:14.000 --> 17:15.417
Why don't you keep
your nose out of it, old man

17:15.500 --> 17:18.125
before I break it for you?

17:18.208 --> 17:21.000
Kid, you rode in
here on a bicycle.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.208
I'm quaking in my boots.

17:26.333 --> 17:30.041
I'm staying, Skiz, so scat.

17:30.125 --> 17:31.333
Woot de do.

17:44.458 --> 17:47.083
(Lilly)
This Skiz clown,
know his real name?

17:47.166 --> 17:48.917
Scott Sienkovic.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.875
(Lloyd)
'I remember,
because he made'

17:50.959 --> 17:53.333
the front page of the
papers a few months later.

17:53.417 --> 17:56.000
Boy scout of the year?

17:56.083 --> 17:58.166
Armed robbery.

17:58.250 --> 17:59.709
Shot a bank teller.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.417
Had it out for
Hawkins big time, Skiz.

18:08.834 --> 18:10.750
And we know you're
not shy with a firearm.

18:10.834 --> 18:13.750
Grown man going after
a girl half his age.

18:13.834 --> 18:15.625
Guy deserved to get shot.

18:15.709 --> 18:18.166
You want to tell us, where you
were the night he died?

18:18.250 --> 18:20.166
Bowling at
the Thunderbird Lanes.

18:20.250 --> 18:23.333
Me and 100 other kids
heard that needle skip.

18:23.417 --> 18:25.250
We'll check
that out, Skiz.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.333
Woot de do.

18:27.417 --> 18:28.375
(Kat)
'This Jenny..'

18:28.458 --> 18:29.875
...she your girlfriend long?

18:29.959 --> 18:33.417
Couple of months, before she
got
all obsessed with Hawkins.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.583
How obsessed?

18:34.667 --> 18:36.125
She kept calling the radio

18:36.208 --> 18:38.959
writing him letters,
talking about him nonstop.

18:39.041 --> 18:40.709
You know, real psycho stuff.

18:40.792 --> 18:43.208
- You think they had an
affair?
- Must have.

18:43.291 --> 18:45.208
Why else would
she give two pennies

18:45.291 --> 18:46.834
about that loser?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.917
Sounds like it
was a one-way street.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.750
She got crazier
and crazier over it.

18:51.834 --> 18:54.959
One night we were
in front of a real rock star

18:55.041 --> 18:57.542
and as usual, all she cared
about was The Hawk.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.291
(Hawk)
'Alright!'

19:01.375 --> 19:03.333
Now here's the
one you've been waiting for..

19:03.417 --> 19:06.041
...Little Richard!

19:26.792 --> 19:28.709
Skiz, you got to help me
get to The Hawk.

19:28.792 --> 19:29.959
Stop acting nutso, Jenny.

19:30.041 --> 19:31.458
I got to see him,
you don't understand.

19:31.542 --> 19:32.750
He's an old coot.
Why do you care?

19:32.834 --> 19:35.000
Don't talk
about him like that!

19:35.083 --> 19:36.500
You're on your
own, dollface.

19:39.709 --> 19:44.542
- Do this, we'll go park
later.
- Promise?

19:44.625 --> 19:47.083
You helping me get
to him or not?

19:47.166 --> 19:48.375
Woot de do.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.917
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- We got to talk to The Hawk.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.125
Yeah, and I got a date
with Jayne Mansfield.

19:59.208 --> 20:00.583
- You think you're funny?
- Hawk!

20:02.333 --> 20:04.375
Hey!

20:04.458 --> 20:06.875
Hey! Why'd you stop
taking my calls?

20:06.959 --> 20:08.208
I've been busy, Jenny.

20:08.291 --> 20:09.583
You shouldn't even
be back here, alright?

20:09.667 --> 20:11.625
It's just...I just
want to talk.

20:11.709 --> 20:13.917
- About what?
- Us.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.458
Us?

20:15.542 --> 20:17.291
Jenny, there is no us.

20:21.500 --> 20:22.834
I made it for you.

20:29.125 --> 20:30.333
Play it.

20:30.417 --> 20:31.917
You'll understand everything.

20:35.709 --> 20:37.000
I'll never forget you.

20:45.417 --> 20:47.125
(John)
'"Scarlet Rose."'

20:47.208 --> 20:48.625
Same song Hawk was playing

20:48.709 --> 20:51.083
on the radio
when he was killed.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.917
Know where
we can find this Jenny?

20:53.000 --> 20:56.458
Ran into her
after I got out of jail.

20:56.542 --> 20:57.500
All married.

20:57.583 --> 20:58.959
Mrs. Jenny Monahan.

20:59.041 --> 21:01.959
Pretended like
she didn't know me.

21:02.041 --> 21:03.125
That's a surprise.

21:04.834 --> 21:06.166
Can I get out of here?

21:06.250 --> 21:07.458
Yeah.

21:10.208 --> 21:13.000
Sounds like we got
a groupie gone wild.

21:13.083 --> 21:16.250
At 17, you think
your
first love's your
last.

21:16.333 --> 21:18.625
Every fan knew
where the Hawk broadcast.

21:18.709 --> 21:20.750
I wonder if Jenny
found her way there.

21:20.834 --> 21:22.333
And found, the Hawk's gun.

21:36.625 --> 21:38.542
What's going on, Mike?

21:38.625 --> 21:40.458
What do you mean?

21:41.125 --> 21:42.291
This.

21:44.208 --> 21:46.375
It's got to be be
some kind of
virus.

21:46.458 --> 21:47.792
Think I can
afford
to miss work?

21:47.875 --> 21:49.208
The doc says you're
okay physically.

21:49.291 --> 21:53.875
Oh, he's just
pissed
I'm late with his
bills.

22:01.417 --> 22:04.709
- DA called me again.
- Yeah?

22:04.792 --> 22:07.959
Yeah, this
Coach Fitzpatrick thing.

22:10.667 --> 22:13.375
Case is...falling apart.

22:15.458 --> 22:19.000
Only guy who
agreed to testify is..

22:19.083 --> 22:21.041
...getting scared.

22:21.125 --> 22:23.750
He might go south on the stand.

22:23.834 --> 22:25.834
Hmm.

22:25.917 --> 22:29.083
Judge could toss it.

22:31.417 --> 22:32.583
You sure you
don't remember anything?

22:32.667 --> 22:33.583
No way.

22:33.667 --> 22:36.542
I ask because..

22:36.625 --> 22:38.083
...there was this one night

22:38.166 --> 22:39.458
you came home from practice.

22:39.542 --> 22:41.542
Oh, God, Scotty,
that was a long time ago.

22:41.625 --> 22:44.959
'Yeah, but I remember, 'cause..'

22:45.041 --> 22:46.291
...you were pretty messed up.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.333
You slept in your clothes.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.166
You okay, Mike?

23:00.250 --> 23:02.000
I'm fine.

23:02.083 --> 23:03.166
Go to sleep.

23:04.875 --> 23:06.625
Something happen at practice?

23:08.208 --> 23:09.375
No.

23:11.875 --> 23:13.041
Hey, why are you
being so quiet?

23:13.125 --> 23:15.625
Just don't go there
no more, okay?

23:15.709 --> 23:18.542
Don't go near the coach.

23:18.625 --> 23:19.792
Why?

23:25.208 --> 23:27.208
You want to play guess?

23:29.875 --> 23:31.458
Come on.

23:31.542 --> 23:33.500
Guess this song.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.500
You got it?

23:46.583 --> 23:49.291
Scotty, I'm too tired, okay?

23:51.917 --> 23:53.208
Okay.

23:53.291 --> 23:54.625
Play tomorrow night.

23:56.667 --> 23:57.583
Alright.

23:57.667 --> 23:58.875
Night, Mikey.

24:00.458 --> 24:01.625
Night.

24:17.792 --> 24:20.625
I don't remember that night.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.250
What about that song?

24:23.333 --> 24:25.000
No.

24:25.083 --> 24:27.166
- 'You're sure?'
- I'm tired, Scotty.

24:27.250 --> 24:30.709
That was the only time I ever
saw you get so...bummed out.

24:30.792 --> 24:32.500
I mean, you were crying..

24:32.583 --> 24:34.083
If I was bawling,
it was probably

24:34.166 --> 24:37.875
because that weasel,
Jay Shortz cheap-shotted me.

24:39.041 --> 24:41.083
Yeah.

24:41.166 --> 24:42.375
Probably.

24:42.458 --> 24:45.000
We'll talk later, alright?
I'm just beat.

24:58.250 --> 25:01.166
You don't get better soon,
I'm going to pound you.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.917
Oh, yeah,
that'll be the
day.

25:43.250 --> 25:44.583
How about
a little music?

25:44.667 --> 25:45.834
May I?

26:31.125 --> 26:33.417
Interesting lyrics
you wrote for The Hawk.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.041
How'd you get
that record?

26:35.125 --> 26:37.375
(Nick)
Bones kept all
of Hawk's stuff.

26:37.458 --> 26:39.709
Including the song he was
playing when you killed him.

26:39.792 --> 26:42.667
Me? Oh, you're joking, right?

26:42.750 --> 26:45.166
Back then it was
called a teenage crush.

26:45.250 --> 26:46.542
Now we call it stalking.

26:46.625 --> 26:50.000
I was a lonely confused kid,
not a murderer.

26:50.083 --> 26:52.000
I can't just take
your word for it, Jenny.

26:52.083 --> 26:54.834
I was at home
that night with my sisters.

26:54.917 --> 26:56.834
Believe me, Hawk
had bigger problems

26:56.917 --> 26:59.208
than a love sick teenybopper.

26:59.291 --> 27:00.959
What kind of problems
we talking?

27:03.041 --> 27:08.208
One night...I snuck into
the station to see him.

27:08.291 --> 27:10.542
I got an idea
of what he was up against.

27:10.625 --> 27:13.542
- Meaning what?
- The record companies.

27:13.625 --> 27:15.458
They were always trying
to make him take payola.

27:15.542 --> 27:17.000
Hawk doesn't sound
like the kind of DJ

27:17.083 --> 27:18.625
that would take
money to play a song.

27:18.709 --> 27:20.458
Well, that didn't stop
them from trying.

27:28.917 --> 27:30.333
(Hawk)
'Thanks, Ben.'

27:30.417 --> 27:31.709
Didn't know you were
buying dinner tonight.

27:31.792 --> 27:33.458
Well, now, I sent you
a record last week

27:33.542 --> 27:36.417
expected it
on the air by now.

27:36.500 --> 27:39.709
- I'm not for sale.
- Everyone's for sale.

27:39.792 --> 27:42.208
Funny, I heard you play
one of my groups today.

27:42.291 --> 27:43.875
Hey, I got nothing
against your label.

27:43.959 --> 27:45.041
Was it that new
Warner Mack tune?

27:45.125 --> 27:46.083
That's pretty hot.

27:46.166 --> 27:48.250
No, the Darts, "Square Town."

27:48.333 --> 27:49.667
(Hawk)
Oh, Bones picked that one.

27:49.750 --> 27:51.959
Yeah, I give him
a pick each day.

27:52.041 --> 27:53.959
And he chose mine.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.583
You saying that Bones
took money to play a song?

28:01.667 --> 28:04.583
Bones understands the game.

28:04.667 --> 28:06.667
DJs like you are dinosaurs.

28:06.750 --> 28:08.208
- That right?
- 'Yeah.'

28:08.291 --> 28:10.250
We got the money,
the artists, the control.

28:10.333 --> 28:13.583
Radio is just my personal
handshake to the buying
public.

28:13.667 --> 28:15.250
If the buying public
doesn't want it?

28:15.333 --> 28:18.583
<i>entree</i>
you eat what's on the plate.

28:18.667 --> 28:20.959
You know what,
people like you take
everything

28:21.041 --> 28:24.709
that is real and good
and you turn it into tinsel.

28:24.792 --> 28:26.542
'But the worst part..'

28:26.625 --> 28:31.667
...tinsel-man is that
you don't even know it.

28:31.750 --> 28:33.125
Oh, so you're
the big shot celebrity

28:33.208 --> 28:34.625
with all the answers,
that it?

28:34.709 --> 28:36.875
No, I'm just like
the kids. I'm a fan.

28:36.959 --> 28:38.750
(Hawk)
I'm a damn
fan
of the music.

28:38.834 --> 28:40.625
Now, if
you'll
excuse me

28:40.709 --> 28:42.250
I have to sell some toothpaste.

28:42.333 --> 28:44.125
Give my best to Bones.

28:44.208 --> 28:46.792
(Hawk)
That's right!
Zip toothpaste!

28:46.875 --> 28:48.500
You want to keep
your smile hip

28:48.583 --> 28:51.291
you'd better brush
with some Zip!

28:59.542 --> 29:01.875
Gave up the singing career
then and there.

29:01.959 --> 29:04.083
Saw how cut throat it was.

29:04.166 --> 29:07.083
That the last time
you saw The Hawk?

29:07.166 --> 29:08.583
He looked crushed.

29:08.667 --> 29:10.834
So, the Hawk knew
Bones was on the take.

29:10.917 --> 29:13.208
And maybe, Hawk was going
to do something about it.

29:16.834 --> 29:19.083
Your career is over
if authorities

29:19.166 --> 29:21.959
knew you were taking
payola, right, Bones?

29:22.041 --> 29:23.834
FCC was cracking down

29:23.917 --> 29:26.750
lot of people's lives
ruined over that.

29:26.834 --> 29:28.125
You can't prove I took money.

29:28.208 --> 29:29.917
We don't care about
payola in '58.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.542
We care about
who killed John Hawkins?

29:32.625 --> 29:34.500
Hawk confront you
on what you did?

29:34.583 --> 29:36.417
The same night he found out.

29:36.500 --> 29:38.125
Keep talking.

29:38.208 --> 29:40.834
I never meant to betray him.

29:40.917 --> 29:42.959
But you did, Bones.

29:43.041 --> 29:45.417
It didn't matter.

29:45.500 --> 29:48.166
Something had
already changed in him.

29:50.583 --> 29:55.291
If I get my own show,
you girls are my first
guests.

30:01.792 --> 30:03.709
Bones, we gotta talk.

30:03.792 --> 30:06.041
Hawk! Have a seat.

30:06.125 --> 30:08.583
This is, uh, this is Gigi..

30:08.667 --> 30:10.792
...and this is Lulu. Gilugilu.

30:13.083 --> 30:14.834
You mind, girls?

30:14.917 --> 30:16.917
Need some privacy.

30:24.041 --> 30:25.041
Hurry back.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.458
What are you doing here, Bones?

30:28.542 --> 30:29.750
Mr. Ockley invited me.

30:29.834 --> 30:31.291
(Bones)
'This is some shindig, huh?'

30:31.375 --> 30:34.375
I got two chicks after
me.
Can you believe that?

30:34.458 --> 30:35.625
They're hookers, Bones.

30:37.291 --> 30:39.417
W-what?

30:39.500 --> 30:42.792
No, Lulu's a...
dance student and Gigi's
a..

30:42.875 --> 30:44.750
'Stripper.'

30:44.834 --> 30:46.291
Seen her act, umbrellas.

30:48.166 --> 30:49.083
You're fooling.

30:49.166 --> 30:50.166
I know you took money

30:50.250 --> 30:52.125
to play that Darts song.

30:55.750 --> 30:57.208
It was just one song.

30:57.291 --> 31:00.250
That one song means that
they've got me over a barrel.

31:00.333 --> 31:01.250
I don't understand.

31:01.333 --> 31:05.166
I could go to jail..

31:05.250 --> 31:07.125
...because of what you did.

31:07.208 --> 31:10.458
Mr. Ockley says it's
how the game is
played.

31:10.542 --> 31:12.667
You know
what the game is, Bones?

31:12.750 --> 31:16.250
It's the music,
and the fans who love it.

31:16.333 --> 31:18.458
And then there's all this.

31:18.542 --> 31:21.750
The dealmakers, the sellouts,
the price of your soul.

31:23.333 --> 31:24.583
I'm sorry, Hawk.

31:26.041 --> 31:27.500
I'm so sorry.

31:31.917 --> 31:33.667
What are you gonna do?

31:33.750 --> 31:35.291
I don't know, maybe
leave Philly for a while.

31:35.375 --> 31:38.291
- What about your show?
- Aw, to hell with it.

31:38.375 --> 31:40.375
To hell with all of this.

31:40.458 --> 31:44.125
I got somethin' more
important in my life now.

31:44.208 --> 31:45.375
Jenny.

31:47.375 --> 31:48.917
But she's just a fan.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.959
No.

31:51.041 --> 31:52.333
She's more than that.

31:53.667 --> 31:55.583
Me and her gonna take
a little trip out west.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.291
Hawk..

32:02.208 --> 32:05.917
...I just wanted
to be a winner..

32:06.000 --> 32:07.709
...like you.

32:07.792 --> 32:10.000
You always were, kid.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.792
Steep price we all paid.

32:25.875 --> 32:27.542
Some more than others.

32:27.625 --> 32:30.875
So Jenny and Hawk
were goin' away together?

32:30.959 --> 32:32.250
That was the plan.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.834
But the next night
Hawk was dead.

32:38.583 --> 32:39.959
Funny how Jenny
failed to mention

32:40.041 --> 32:41.375
her travel plans with Hawk.

32:41.458 --> 32:42.959
Failed to mention
a lot more than that.

32:43.041 --> 32:44.458
- Oh, yeah?
- Follow me.

32:44.542 --> 32:45.875
That documentary dude..

32:45.959 --> 32:47.500
...he's got nothin' on me.

32:47.583 --> 32:49.291
Check it out.

32:50.792 --> 32:52.917
The lyrics to "Scarlet Rose."

32:53.000 --> 32:55.792
See, the way Jenny reacted
to that song, got me
thinking.

32:55.875 --> 32:57.375
We already heard
the lyrics, Nick.

32:57.458 --> 32:59.375
Well, I've been on
the phone with ASCAP all day.

32:59.458 --> 33:00.375
What's that?

33:00.458 --> 33:02.083
The American Society
of Composers.

33:02.166 --> 33:03.750
And it turns out,
there were some lyrics

33:03.834 --> 33:05.000
that Jenny didn't record.

33:05.083 --> 33:06.709
- Really?
- 'Yeah.'

33:06.792 --> 33:08.041
(Nick)
'Like that Elton John
song "Daniel?"'

33:08.125 --> 33:09.250
You know what that's about?

33:09.333 --> 33:10.875
A guy missin'
his brother Daniel.

33:10.959 --> 33:12.667
Yeah, but you never know
the reason why

33:12.750 --> 33:15.333
'cause of the verses
he left out about Vietnam.

33:15.417 --> 33:17.417
"Daniel's" about Vietnam?

33:17.500 --> 33:18.458
How do you know that?

33:18.542 --> 33:19.709
The ASCAP chick told me.

33:19.792 --> 33:21.750
See, changes the entire meaning.

33:21.834 --> 33:24.583
So look at the lyrics
that Jenny didn't record.

33:24.667 --> 33:26.750
"So dream your
sweet little dreams

33:26.834 --> 33:28.625
"and I will kiss
your tiny cheek

33:28.709 --> 33:30.166
"and though
I must leave now

33:30.250 --> 33:31.792
'know that you'll
always be with me."'

33:31.875 --> 33:35.375
"I offer up this prayer,
that everywhere she goes

33:35.458 --> 33:39.917
please protect my baby,
my sweet, sweet, Scarlet Rose."

33:40.000 --> 33:42.750
Song is registered
under the name, John Hawkins.

33:42.834 --> 33:44.250
(Nick)
'Circa 1942.'

33:44.333 --> 33:46.750
So The Hawk wrote it, not Jenny.

33:46.834 --> 33:49.083
Sounds like a lullaby.

33:49.166 --> 33:51.542
Well, maybe Jenny
wasn't his girlfriend.

33:51.625 --> 33:54.500
My money,
says she's his daughter.

34:02.166 --> 34:05.417
John Hawkins was your father.
Not your heartthrob.

34:05.500 --> 34:08.333
He divorced Dottie
when you were four.

34:08.417 --> 34:10.000
Why keep that secret, Jenny?

34:10.083 --> 34:11.792
I never considered him
my father.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.500
He-he left.
I never saw him again.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.291
So why track him down?

34:15.375 --> 34:16.625
(Kat)
'Maybe 'cause you
wanted to tell Hawk'

34:16.709 --> 34:18.166
what it felt like
to be abandoned?

34:18.250 --> 34:20.250
And maybe he rejected you again.

34:20.333 --> 34:22.625
So you start
sneakin'
into the station--

34:22.709 --> 34:24.291
You're wrong.
It wasn't like that.

34:24.375 --> 34:26.959
Come on, Jenny. Your father
let you down once, then twice.

34:27.041 --> 34:29.000
- So you made him pay.
- No!

34:32.750 --> 34:34.834
Finding him was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

34:36.834 --> 34:38.291
When did you tell
him who you were?

34:38.375 --> 34:41.000
The night Little Richard
played.
When I gave him my record.

34:43.333 --> 34:46.583
I couldn't leave.
I had to find him.

35:10.542 --> 35:13.000
I used to play this song for..

35:13.083 --> 35:14.500
...a little girl I knew.

35:16.333 --> 35:21.500
I used to sit her up right
next to me like a princess.

35:21.583 --> 35:23.083
Was her middle name Rosemary?

35:24.875 --> 35:27.500
Jennifer Rosemary Hawkins.

35:27.583 --> 35:29.375
I used to tell her
that scarlet roses

35:29.458 --> 35:31.959
were the prettiest in the world.

35:35.083 --> 35:36.875
Just like his little girl.

35:36.959 --> 35:38.291
Your Scarlet Rose.

35:39.625 --> 35:41.542
I was so afraid to tell you.

35:42.959 --> 35:44.875
So you did it in a song.

35:44.959 --> 35:47.417
You listened to it?

35:47.500 --> 35:48.709
It's beautiful.

35:50.792 --> 35:55.041
Six months ago I found some
old photos mom hid away.

35:55.125 --> 35:57.500
When we were a family.

35:59.500 --> 36:00.709
You remembered me at all?

36:00.792 --> 36:02.500
I never forgot you.

36:05.417 --> 36:08.208
I want you to understand
why I had to leave.

36:08.291 --> 36:09.709
- Doesn't matter now.
- No.

36:09.792 --> 36:13.417
I was livin' for myself.
I was constantly on the move.

36:13.500 --> 36:17.542
One year in New York,
next year in LA.

36:17.625 --> 36:20.041
Lots of cigarettes
and booze and..

36:23.250 --> 36:25.792
...lot of static.

36:25.875 --> 36:28.375
Dottie was right. It was,
it was no place for a kid.

36:28.458 --> 36:29.959
I wouldn't have cared.

36:37.166 --> 36:40.667
How about we take
that trip...anywhere?

36:43.333 --> 36:44.959
Let me make up for lost time.

36:47.417 --> 36:48.750
What about your show?

36:48.834 --> 36:51.834
I told 'em I was gonna
take a little time off

36:51.917 --> 36:53.709
to spend with my family.

37:01.875 --> 37:04.333
We talked about leaving
in a couple of weeks.

37:04.417 --> 37:08.250
He said I could sing backup
with a band in California.

37:08.333 --> 37:10.792
But all I cared about
was having my dad back.

37:13.375 --> 37:16.291
Well, how'd your mom
take the news?

37:16.375 --> 37:18.083
I never told her.

37:18.166 --> 37:20.041
(Kat)
'You sure?'

37:20.125 --> 37:21.458
Might get her upset?

37:21.542 --> 37:24.041
Might even go
talk to the
Hawk.

37:25.959 --> 37:27.333
Try to stop him.

37:29.792 --> 37:33.291
Everything my mom did
was because she loved me.

37:38.583 --> 37:43.333
I understand you
and Hawk had a daughter.

37:43.417 --> 37:46.083
Jenny was legally adopted
by my second husband.

37:48.417 --> 37:50.166
Still. It's, uh..

37:50.250 --> 37:53.250
...strange how you
left that out.

37:53.333 --> 37:55.000
John was never
much of a father.

37:55.083 --> 37:56.792
So, uh, it didn't matter.

37:58.917 --> 38:00.625
What about your own father?

38:02.500 --> 38:03.917
What does he have
to do with this?

38:04.000 --> 38:07.375
Your mom died young,
and your father raised
you.

38:09.333 --> 38:11.500
The musician?

38:11.583 --> 38:13.375
If you can call
playing at Holiday Inns

38:13.458 --> 38:15.542
along Route 1 being a musician.

38:15.625 --> 38:18.291
Died on the road at age 43.

38:20.625 --> 38:22.834
Suicide.

38:22.917 --> 38:27.959
I can see how Jenny wanting
to be a singer
was...upsetting.

38:28.041 --> 38:29.458
She wouldn't listen to me.

38:29.542 --> 38:32.959
She thought her passion
was enough to give it a try.

38:33.041 --> 38:34.625
Passion

38:35.792 --> 38:37.375
Passion is a fifth grade girl

38:37.458 --> 38:40.250
finding her dad hanging dead
in a motel bathroom.

38:40.333 --> 38:42.709
You'd do anything to keep
Jenny from ending up like
that.

38:42.792 --> 38:44.875
I was trying to protect her.

38:44.959 --> 38:46.709
'But she was determined.'

38:46.792 --> 38:48.875
And she wanted her real dad

38:48.959 --> 38:50.333
to help make her
dreams come true.

38:50.417 --> 38:53.542
And what does he do?
He encourages her.

38:53.625 --> 38:56.291
He invites her
to California to sing.

38:56.375 --> 38:57.417
My God.

39:00.125 --> 39:02.917
You went to the studio
that night, didn't you,
Dottie?

39:05.458 --> 39:06.625
To stop him.

39:12.417 --> 39:15.000
I went there to talk.

39:15.083 --> 39:16.250
I swear.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.792
Just to talk.

39:30.834 --> 39:31.959
Dot?

39:37.250 --> 39:40.166
Jenny told me everything.

39:40.250 --> 39:41.917
You stay away from her.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.458
She's my daughter too, Dottie.

39:44.542 --> 39:46.166
No.

39:46.250 --> 39:50.291
A daughter is someone you raise.

39:50.375 --> 39:52.417
Someone you take to girl scouts.

39:52.500 --> 39:55.458
Someone you make
dinner for every
night.

39:55.542 --> 39:57.166
Whose tears you wipe
when she cries.

39:57.250 --> 39:58.458
I want to be there for her now.

39:58.542 --> 40:00.458
You just want to fill
her head with nonsense.

40:00.542 --> 40:02.083
No, I want her to dream.

40:02.166 --> 40:04.875
Or at least to try, Dottie,
don't take away her dreams.

40:04.959 --> 40:06.417
You abandoned us.

40:06.500 --> 40:08.917
You're a selfish son of a
bitch
and you always will be.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.125
I'm not that man anymore.

40:11.208 --> 40:12.959
You will ruin her life.

40:13.041 --> 40:15.291
Poison her with
silly notions of
singing.

40:15.375 --> 40:16.667
She is good, Dottie.

40:16.750 --> 40:19.125
- She is really good.
- I've heard enough.

40:19.208 --> 40:20.959
No, I want you to
hear this, alright.

40:21.041 --> 40:22.291
- She's got talent, Dottie.
- 'Stop it.'

40:22.375 --> 40:24.458
(Hawk)
She's got real
talent.

40:27.875 --> 40:29.166
Let's slow it down for a sec

40:29.250 --> 40:32.458
for a little ballad
called "Scarlet Rose."

40:50.083 --> 40:52.834
- Dottie.
- I can't lose her, John.

40:54.458 --> 40:56.667
Take it easy, Dottie.

40:56.750 --> 40:58.375
Take it easy.

40:58.458 --> 41:00.208
Don't fill her with dreams.

41:01.834 --> 41:04.709
Dreams just break your heart.

41:04.792 --> 41:05.834
Give me that thing, Dottie.

41:07.291 --> 41:09.125
Come on now,
sweetheart, come on.

41:10.750 --> 41:12.417
'That's right.'

41:12.500 --> 41:13.667
Okay.

41:15.083 --> 41:17.250
There you go.

44:24.291 --> 44:25.542
