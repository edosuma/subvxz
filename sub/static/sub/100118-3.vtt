WEBVTT

00:02.524 --> 00:04.395
Previously onDynasty...Mr. Carrington, on the charge

00:04.439 --> 00:05.918
of murder, how do you plead?Not guilty, Your Honor.

00:05.962 --> 00:07.572
Your request for bail is denied.

00:07.616 --> 00:09.357
I'm remanding you
back into custody.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.880
STEVEN: Melissa.You're not the father,
Steven.

00:10.923 --> 00:12.751
My gyno is.JEFF: Police will find evidence

00:12.795 --> 00:14.231
that Adam was involved

00:14.275 --> 00:15.885
in my disappearance. DOMINIQUE: Jeff won't be

00:15.928 --> 00:17.234
a problem anymore.

00:17.278 --> 00:18.453
DAPHNE:
Your building
will be designated

00:18.496 --> 00:20.629
a historical landmark.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.283
GENIE:
My great-grandfather Bernard

00:22.326 --> 00:24.285
was an advocate
for gay conversion therapy.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.461
SAM:
Our only option is
to cancel Media Day.

00:26.504 --> 00:27.592
You do not want
to mess with

00:27.636 --> 00:29.986
the president of
the Historical Alliance.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.119
FALLON:
I have made many bad choices
in my life,

00:32.162 --> 00:34.077
but I am ready to atone.

00:34.121 --> 00:37.124
I'm sentencing you to 100 hours
of community service.

00:37.167 --> 00:38.908
I was supposed to be
there for Blake.They made me acting

00:38.951 --> 00:40.257
CEO of the winery.

00:40.301 --> 00:42.085
Considering you're
not a Carrington.

00:42.129 --> 00:45.393
Blake Carrington,
will you marry me?

00:45.436 --> 00:48.831
♪ Want you to feel my cry,
ooh-ow ♪

00:48.874 --> 00:52.922
♪ Want you to feel
my cry, ooh-ow ♪

00:52.965 --> 00:55.055
♪ Want you to feel it.

00:56.621 --> 01:00.625
Buenos dias,Mrs. Carrington.

01:00.669 --> 01:02.236
Mm, has a nice ring to it.

01:02.279 --> 01:04.455
Actually, it makes me think
of Alexis.

01:04.499 --> 01:06.588
I may have to stick
with Cristal.

01:06.631 --> 01:09.112
But, speaking of rings,
you need a welder's mask

01:09.156 --> 01:11.027
to look at that thing.
Thank you.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.377
Feels a little strange wearing
it while Blake's still in jail.Honey,

01:13.421 --> 01:15.249
you don't buy ten karats
to keep it in the box.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.077
Blake would want you
to wear it, trust me.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.253
In fact, we should celebrate
this good news.

01:19.296 --> 01:21.255
It would feel even
stranger to have a party

01:21.298 --> 01:22.386
while he's in jail.

01:22.430 --> 01:24.301
Totally agree.
But it wouldn't be

01:24.345 --> 01:25.824
strange for me
to host

01:25.868 --> 01:28.610
a small, intimate Halloween hang
tomorrow night, would it?

01:28.653 --> 01:30.264
How small and intimate?

01:30.307 --> 01:32.875
Oh, 300 of my nearest
and dearest.Yeah.

01:32.918 --> 01:34.268
Count me out. I'm
definitely not partying

01:34.311 --> 01:36.444
while Blake is in jail.Really? Seems like

01:36.487 --> 01:37.793
the perfect time to me.

01:37.836 --> 01:40.970
Oh. Don't go all wicked
stepmother on me now.

01:41.013 --> 01:42.319
Fallon, do you want
to help me plan?

01:42.363 --> 01:43.755
'Cause I have a lot of things
to do at the hotel.

01:43.799 --> 01:44.974
No. Not interested.

01:45.017 --> 01:46.280
I find it's best
to let the gays

01:46.323 --> 01:47.977
handle this holiday
on their own.

01:48.020 --> 01:50.284
The only thing I'll be prepping
for are my days of atonement.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.199
What, you're fasting?No, not the Jewish kind.

01:52.242 --> 01:55.158
I'm going to visit Annie Tate
later to apologize again.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.986
Hopefully we won't need
paramedics this time.

01:57.029 --> 01:59.336
And then there's the whole
Culhane situation to deal with.

01:59.380 --> 02:00.511
But first

02:00.555 --> 02:02.861
I have to go start
community service.

02:04.994 --> 02:08.040
What?Are you really gonna do that?
I thought it was just symbolic.

02:08.084 --> 02:09.390
Don't you have lawyers
to get you out of that?

02:09.433 --> 02:11.305
I don't want to get out of it.
I want to do it.

02:11.348 --> 02:14.177
That's why I confessed.
To pay my debts to society.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.092
Not to have some lawyer
get rid of it for me.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.137
Are you sure you're cut out

02:17.180 --> 02:18.181
for that kind of work?

02:18.225 --> 02:19.356
I'm going to the rec center.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.010
At worst, I'll be teaching
some kids

02:21.053 --> 02:22.142
how to swing a tennis racket.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.186
ADAM:
Ugh-- I guess it's the kids

02:23.230 --> 02:24.535
we should be worried about.

02:24.579 --> 02:26.102
Or I could grab my racket
right now

02:26.146 --> 02:28.191
and show you my forehand,
up close.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.324
Ooh, such a temper.

02:30.367 --> 02:33.501
I see now why Laura Van Kirk
needed a restraining order.

02:33.544 --> 02:35.155
What?Not surprised.

02:35.198 --> 02:37.983
Is that supposed to be a secret?
Oops. My bad.

02:38.027 --> 02:40.377
You know, I also heard
that Laura had to put a bed

02:40.421 --> 02:43.293
in the hospital room,
which means you're not even able

02:43.337 --> 02:44.990
to see Liam.
Tough break.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.427
Well, don't worry, okay?

02:46.470 --> 02:47.950
'Cause it's temporary.
And Liam will be discharged

02:47.993 --> 02:50.474
from the hospital soon,
and I will be at his doorstep

02:50.518 --> 02:51.649
the moment he gets home.

02:51.693 --> 02:53.085
I'm gonna go.

02:53.129 --> 02:55.653
Enjoy your meal.
Or choke on it.

02:55.697 --> 02:57.481
And on that note,

02:57.525 --> 02:59.875
I'm already late for
a meeting at the hotel.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.006
Ciao-ciao.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.491
Cristal.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.060
I see you're having entitlement
for breakfast.

03:11.103 --> 03:13.584
Didn't take you long
to get comfortable

03:13.628 --> 03:14.846
in my father's chair.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.152
Don't be jealous.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.286
I'm sure we can find you
a high chair somewhere.

03:41.046 --> 03:42.483
Your snoring kept
me up all night.

03:42.526 --> 03:46.661
Again. Next time you
won't come up for air.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.445
Carrington.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.186
You got a visitor.

03:52.057 --> 03:54.277
DOMINIQUE: I want power
of attorney over Jeff's accounts

03:54.321 --> 03:55.800
so I can access his money.

03:55.844 --> 03:56.801
That won't be easy.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.673
I know.
That's why I called you.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.805
There's not a lot I can do
without a signature.

04:00.849 --> 04:03.460
You're a lawyer. Draft something
that will fly in court.

04:03.504 --> 04:05.027
If a signature is
our biggest problem,

04:05.070 --> 04:06.420
we have nothing to worry about.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.117
You know this is going
to cost you, right?

04:08.160 --> 04:11.773
You'll get paid once Iget paid.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.475
Why is there no glass?

04:18.519 --> 04:20.434
I always wanted to use
one of those phones, you know?

04:20.477 --> 04:21.913
And then put my hand up
on the window,

04:21.957 --> 04:23.132
like we were
in a Lifetime movie.

04:23.175 --> 04:24.786
You know,
the father who abandons

04:24.829 --> 04:26.918
his daughter,
then gets arrested for murder?

04:26.962 --> 04:28.572
What do you want, Fallon?I need a favor.

04:28.616 --> 04:31.227
Do I look like I'm handing out
favors right now?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.011
Well, you owe me.
I saved your ass.

04:33.055 --> 04:35.231
When I went to the police
and I told the truth

04:35.275 --> 04:38.147
about Trixie, I told them
that Mack dumped her body

04:38.190 --> 04:39.453
in the lake and not you?

04:39.496 --> 04:42.412
Oh, thank you.
Y-You deserve a billion dollars.

04:42.456 --> 04:43.805
Oh, wait, I already
gave you that.

04:43.848 --> 04:45.763
I want Adam out of the house.
Now.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.417
Fallon, I don't have time.Seems like you've got

04:47.461 --> 04:49.158
nothing buttime, unless
there's an escape meeting

04:49.201 --> 04:52.335
you're late to.
He is messing with my life.

04:52.379 --> 04:54.163
I admit that Adam
has made mistakes.

04:54.206 --> 04:55.556
But he's helping me now.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.209
As acting CEO of the winery.

04:57.253 --> 04:58.472
Because in case you haven't
noticed, I'm in jail!

04:58.515 --> 05:00.952
Hey, take it easy, Shawshank.

05:00.996 --> 05:03.259
Listen, we all have to pay
for our sins, okay?

05:03.303 --> 05:05.174
For instance, I start
community service today,

05:05.217 --> 05:06.697
which is basically
the same thing

05:06.741 --> 05:08.656
without the communal showers.Really?

05:08.699 --> 05:10.135
Because I know you're just
gonna pay your supervisor

05:10.179 --> 05:12.442
to say you did your hours;
I know how you operate.

05:12.486 --> 05:14.444
Why does everybody think
that I can't do this?

05:14.488 --> 05:17.142
I turned myself in because
I want to atone.

05:17.186 --> 05:19.362
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.582
You'll see. You'll all see.

05:21.625 --> 05:24.933
I am gonna deal with Adam
on my own. Thanks for nothing!

05:27.239 --> 05:29.154
ANDERS:
Sam, have you seen

05:29.198 --> 05:31.331
this invoice
from our contractor?

05:31.374 --> 05:35.073
Sounds like your department.It is.

05:35.117 --> 05:38.381
And now, thanks in no small part
to items like the Zellige tile

05:38.425 --> 05:40.470
that you shipped all the way
from Morocco,

05:40.514 --> 05:41.776
we're way over budget.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.691
Can you really put a price
on beauty?

05:43.734 --> 05:45.257
Yes, you can, actually.
It's right there.

05:45.301 --> 05:47.564
We can't keep spending
like this.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.174
You're gonna have to scale back
the renovations.

05:49.218 --> 05:52.090
Anders, I don't have time
for budget issues right now.

05:52.134 --> 05:54.658
The president of the Historical
Alliance is due any minute now,

05:54.702 --> 05:56.617
and I need to get
my charm game on

05:56.660 --> 05:59.315
if I'm going to convince her
to revoke landmark status

05:59.359 --> 06:02.144
and cancel the media event
for the homophobe.MELISSA: Sam?

06:03.754 --> 06:06.540
So our paths
cross yet again.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.150
Isn't this a hoot?

06:09.717 --> 06:11.283
Well, now you can call me
Madam President.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.293
Excuse me? Hi.

06:21.337 --> 06:23.078
Is this the community service
check-in?

06:23.121 --> 06:24.819
I'm sorry I'm late.
I didn't realize

06:24.862 --> 06:26.777
there would be no valet,
and I had to park so far away,

06:26.821 --> 06:29.780
which is annoying, because
I left my racket in the car.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.173
The name's Frank.
And you are...?

06:31.216 --> 06:33.480
Oh, Fallon Carrington.
Reporting for duty.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.569
Got it. Follow me.

06:37.658 --> 06:38.833
Uh, Frank?

06:38.876 --> 06:40.356
Isn't the rec center
that way?

06:40.400 --> 06:41.966
Aren't those
underprivileged kids

06:42.010 --> 06:43.533
in need of some
physical fitness?

06:43.577 --> 06:44.839
Must've been a change.

06:44.882 --> 06:46.754
They got you working out
in the community garden.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.277
Okay. Yeah.
Not a problem.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.844
I would have upped
my SPF, but...

06:49.887 --> 06:51.628
Look, you need to complete
a certain number of hours

06:51.672 --> 06:52.977
per week to fulfill
your service.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.892
Non-completion can
result in jail time.

06:54.936 --> 06:58.330
Now, you have two days
to fix this area up

06:58.374 --> 07:00.289
before I sign the weekly
hours for your judge.

07:00.332 --> 07:01.682
Okay.

07:01.725 --> 07:05.860
Yeah. I can trim a few roses
and plant a few daisies.

07:08.732 --> 07:11.996
Oh, my God,
what is that?

07:12.040 --> 07:12.823
This is your home

07:12.867 --> 07:14.172
for the next two days.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.871
Oh, no, no. Orange
isn't really my palate.

07:16.914 --> 07:19.961
Well, we all have our crosses
to bear, don't we?

07:21.136 --> 07:22.180
This is bull...

07:29.318 --> 07:30.667
Well, I'm sorry to hear that
you and Steven split up,

07:30.711 --> 07:31.538
but don't worry--
I put on a few pounds

07:31.581 --> 07:33.104
after my divorce as well.

07:35.367 --> 07:39.284
Well, thankfully my settlement
provided some comfort.

07:39.328 --> 07:40.764
I hear you had to move out
of Buckhead?

07:40.808 --> 07:43.114
Well, what's important is,
I came out the other side

07:43.158 --> 07:44.159
better than ever.
Yes.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.074
President of
the Historical Alliance.

07:46.117 --> 07:48.076
Do you get Secret Service
with that?

07:48.119 --> 07:50.600
Perhaps we could e-mail each
other the insults later.

07:50.644 --> 07:53.951
And that way I could multitask
and continue the wonderful work

07:53.995 --> 07:55.213
that the A.H.A. does.

07:55.257 --> 07:56.693
It's not all
so wonderful.

07:56.737 --> 07:59.348
This hotel, the one you want
to give landmark status to,

07:59.391 --> 08:00.480
do you know who designed
and built it?

08:00.523 --> 08:02.351
Yes, of course.
Bernard McCarty.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.092
He did a lot of wonderful
things for this city.

08:04.135 --> 08:06.703
He also opened several
gay conversion camps.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.183
It's not exactly
someone I want

08:08.226 --> 08:10.098
to celebrate or honor
in my hotel.

08:10.141 --> 08:12.970
Well, I certainly don't agree
with his personal beliefs.

08:13.014 --> 08:15.320
But I have a job to do, and
that job entails recognizing

08:15.364 --> 08:17.714
the historical significance
of this hotel.

08:17.758 --> 08:19.586
Significant because
of a bigot.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.849
You have to cancel.Cancel?

08:21.892 --> 08:23.241
Don't be ridiculous.

08:23.285 --> 08:25.243
Dozens of media outlets
are covering the event.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.158
Distinguished guests
have been invited.

08:27.202 --> 08:28.595
The mayor is
planning to attend.

08:28.638 --> 08:32.120
We simply cannot cancel.

08:32.163 --> 08:34.339
We could.
You just don't want to.

08:34.383 --> 08:39.214
My crew is already
hanging the plaque.

08:39.257 --> 08:41.521
As much as I love gay
people, and Lord knows

08:41.564 --> 08:43.566
I have slept with
my share of them,

08:43.610 --> 08:48.963
This building is now a
designated historic landmark.

08:53.707 --> 08:57.232
Please don't be a dead squirrel.
Please don't be a dead squirrel.

You know, I didn't think

09:37.228 --> 09:38.447
let alone be half done.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.536
Yeah, well,
I really wanted to create...

09:40.580 --> 09:42.364
Did you say halfdone?This plot's

09:42.407 --> 09:44.758
looking great,
but you do know you're in charge

09:44.801 --> 09:46.194
of both plots, right?

09:47.238 --> 09:48.239
Yeah.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.548
I see the method
to your madness, Franklin.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.333
Don't show the worker bees
what's really in store

09:55.377 --> 09:58.467
so as not to break them
too fast. Yeah.

09:58.510 --> 10:00.861
But I'll tell you what--
I shall not break.

10:00.904 --> 10:03.559
In fact,
I will clean that garden,

10:03.603 --> 10:06.649
I will till that soil,
and as God is my witness,

10:06.693 --> 10:09.260
I will create
the best damn garden

10:09.304 --> 10:12.350
the great state of Georgia
has ever... seen.

10:12.394 --> 10:14.396
But not today.
I have a meeting.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.616
So much to atone for,
so little time.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.315
I got to get out of here
before someone

10:20.358 --> 10:21.403
actually tries to kill me.

10:21.446 --> 10:22.447
I have a plan.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.406
I did some digging
on your judge,

10:24.449 --> 10:26.626
and I think we have
a great case for bias.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.367
We'll get you a new bail hearing
with a more lenient judge.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.892
That could
take weeks.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.328
He has to get out
of here now.

10:33.371 --> 10:35.069
Cristal, I think it's best
you let me handle this.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.288
Because you've handled
everything so well up to now.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.813
If it wasn't for your bizarre
obsession with Fallon,

10:39.856 --> 10:40.814
Blake wouldn't be here

10:40.857 --> 10:41.945
in the first place.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.686
I was simply getting
a sentimental ring

10:43.730 --> 10:45.296
out of the lake
for my sister.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.341
Even Fallon understands.

10:46.384 --> 10:48.082
Really?

10:48.125 --> 10:49.692
Then why was she
here earlier,

10:49.736 --> 10:52.129
demanding that I throw you
out of the manor?

10:52.173 --> 10:54.218
Stop pretending that
your problems with her

10:54.262 --> 10:56.003
haven't led to more
problems for all of us.

10:56.046 --> 10:57.004
If you'd stayed out of the lake,

10:57.047 --> 10:59.746
I'd be in Vail, not... prison.

10:59.789 --> 11:02.139
Don't worry, Blake,

11:02.183 --> 11:05.447
I have a plan to keep you safe.
Trust me.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.883
FALLON:
Excuse me?

11:06.927 --> 11:09.103
Hi. I am looking for
the grief counseling meeting.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.104
Right in there.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.846
Fallon Carrington?

11:14.238 --> 11:15.718
Evan Tate.
Trixie's big brother.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.895
Evan? Wow. I'm sorry,
I barely recognized you.

11:18.939 --> 11:23.421
I mean, you look great,
it's just it's been a while.

11:23.465 --> 11:26.381
Yeah, I guess it has.
Uh, what are you doing here?

11:26.424 --> 11:28.122
Well, I know that your
mom comes to this group,

11:28.165 --> 11:29.776
and I just wanted to
see how she was doing.

11:29.819 --> 11:31.908
I mean, the last time I saw her,
she had a raging panic attack,

11:31.952 --> 11:34.476
which I might have caused, so...No, she's better.

11:34.519 --> 11:37.697
Thanks. Still panics,
but that's mostly about

11:37.740 --> 11:39.089
me never finding a girlfriend.

11:41.439 --> 11:44.094
So, are you living
in Atlanta again?

11:44.138 --> 11:45.487
Moved back a few years ago.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.141
Still doing the corporate
lawyer thing.

11:47.184 --> 11:48.403
So how was the meeting?

11:48.446 --> 11:50.187
It was fine.

11:50.231 --> 11:52.146
You know, after they,
uh, found Trixie,

11:52.189 --> 11:55.323
well, some bad memories
came up for me.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.107
I get it, and, Evan,
I'm so sorry about...

11:57.151 --> 11:58.543
It's okay, Fallon,
you don't have to...No, no, no, no.

11:58.587 --> 12:00.415
It's not okay, Evan.

12:00.458 --> 12:01.633
I really screwed up.

12:01.677 --> 12:04.027
You were probably
pretty scared that night.

12:04.071 --> 12:07.030
You were young.
It was an accident.

12:07.074 --> 12:10.642
And... hating you isn't gonna
bring my sister back.

12:10.686 --> 12:13.254
That's definitely
a different reaction

12:13.297 --> 12:14.298
than I got from your mother.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.953
Yeah.

12:16.997 --> 12:19.956
I, uh, heard about
your community service.Yes, I'm, uh,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.872
paying my penance in hopes
of putting this in the past.

12:22.916 --> 12:26.093
I see.
Well, good luck.

12:26.136 --> 12:29.487
I hope you get
the closure you need.

12:29.531 --> 12:31.881
It was nice to see you,
Fallon.

12:33.491 --> 12:35.015
You look great, too.

12:38.627 --> 12:41.325
Is this some sort
of Halloween prank?

12:41.369 --> 12:43.371
Sam, what the hell happened
to my plaque?

12:43.414 --> 12:46.287
Oh, dear, that's unfortunate.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.375
Unfortunate?

12:47.418 --> 12:49.072
Do you mind telling me
what's going on?

12:49.116 --> 12:51.161
Well, it, um, looks
like a clumsy mistake

12:51.205 --> 12:52.206
from the painters.

12:52.249 --> 12:53.729
Good help is so hard to find.

12:53.773 --> 12:54.730
A clumsy mistake?

12:54.774 --> 12:57.211
Who are you kidding with this?

12:57.254 --> 12:59.474
I don't have time to get
a new plaque by tomorrow.

12:59.517 --> 13:02.303
I guess this means you'll
have to cancel, huh? Shame.

13:02.346 --> 13:03.870
This isn't gonna stop me.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.523
I'll find a way
to reschedule.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.612
And I'll find a way to destroy
every plaque you try putting up.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.832
Don't mess with me, Sam.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.573
I don't stop until
I get what I want.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.009
Just ask your ex-husband.

13:13.053 --> 13:15.490
Get the hell out
of my hotel.

13:20.712 --> 13:23.933
MONICA:
You are not gonna believe this.

13:23.977 --> 13:26.501
What's wrong?
What happened?

13:26.544 --> 13:27.502
I just had a chat
with Cousin Bobbi

13:27.545 --> 13:28.808
down at the police station.

13:28.851 --> 13:31.854
Oh, did she find
new information on Jeff's case?

13:31.898 --> 13:33.377
I got her to show me
the evidence report

13:33.421 --> 13:34.509
from Jeff's crime scene.

13:34.552 --> 13:36.206
On the DL, obviously.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.165
Adam's cuff link
isn't on the list.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.036
Are you sure?I know how to read.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.256
Without that cuff link,
there's nothing connecting Adam

13:42.299 --> 13:43.561
to Jeff's disappearance.

13:43.605 --> 13:45.041
The whole plan blows up.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.782
Well, maybe they just
overlooked something.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.262
We can't just give up.

13:48.305 --> 13:49.741
I'm not giving up.

13:49.785 --> 13:52.396
I'm gonna find out
who took that evidence.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.016
It's me. Are we good to go?

14:03.059 --> 14:04.495
NAOMI:
Not exactly.

14:04.539 --> 14:06.671
Do you know anything about Jeff
moving all of his assets

14:06.715 --> 14:07.716
into a trust account?

14:07.759 --> 14:08.891
No, and I don't care.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.327
Just tell me
the paperwork is done.

14:10.371 --> 14:11.502
It's not.

14:11.546 --> 14:13.243
I need the name and tax ID
of the trust

14:13.287 --> 14:14.723
to create the power of attorney.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.072
Can you get a copy of it?

14:16.116 --> 14:18.422
I don't know where
Jeff kept things like that.

14:18.466 --> 14:19.641
Well, you better figure it out,

14:19.684 --> 14:20.903
because without
that information,

14:20.947 --> 14:21.643
there's no POA,

14:21.686 --> 14:24.124
there's no money.

14:32.654 --> 14:34.395
Heard about your visit
with Father.

14:34.438 --> 14:37.050
Don't be jealous.

14:37.093 --> 14:38.529
It wasn't conjugal.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.923
So, why would you ask him
to throw me out of the manor?

14:40.967 --> 14:42.142
Because I hate you.

14:42.185 --> 14:43.752
And thank you for
coming to my TED Talk.

14:43.795 --> 14:45.449
Goodbye.You really need
to stop blaming me

14:45.493 --> 14:47.016
for everything
that goes wrong in your life.

14:47.060 --> 14:50.237
Oh, no, no, no. I am taking
responsibility for my actions

14:50.280 --> 14:52.804
and only blaming you for
things I know you did.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.328
You know nothing
because you have no proof.

14:54.371 --> 14:56.460
Oh, yeah. That sounds
like an innocent person.

14:57.461 --> 15:00.247
You will regret trying
to separate me from Blake.

15:00.290 --> 15:01.596
He named me

15:01.639 --> 15:03.641
CEO of the winery.Oh, yes.

15:03.685 --> 15:04.991
I heard about that.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.470
Good luck with that bathwater.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.690
Why do you think we
drink so much champagne

15:08.733 --> 15:10.300
around here?

15:10.344 --> 15:11.606
The vineyard's
the most important asset

15:11.649 --> 15:13.042
that Father has left.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.261
So while I'm working

15:14.304 --> 15:16.350
to secure Father's future,

15:16.393 --> 15:17.917
might not be best
for you to come after me.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.527
Or I'll come
right back after you.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.445
You want to come after me?

15:24.488 --> 15:27.665
Bring it on.

15:30.364 --> 15:31.452
SAM:
Why is it so quiet?

15:31.495 --> 15:33.236
Where's the crew?

15:33.280 --> 15:34.716
We can't fall behind.

15:34.759 --> 15:37.110
They just stopped work. Some
sort of a permit problem.

15:37.153 --> 15:38.328
I'm on hold with the city.

15:38.372 --> 15:40.330
Yes. Yes, I'm still here.What...

15:40.374 --> 15:41.549
What kind of permit issue?

15:41.592 --> 15:43.507
The kind where they've
all been revoked.

15:43.551 --> 15:46.119
I do have sway in
certain circles.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.729
No permits means no working

15:47.772 --> 15:50.384
and, therefore,
no clumsy mistakes.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.342
This is unacceptable.Well, accept it.

15:52.386 --> 15:53.953
I've had the mayor's schedule
rearranged,

15:53.996 --> 15:55.998
the press rebooked for tomorrow,

15:56.042 --> 15:57.652
and there's a new plaque
going up.

15:57.695 --> 16:00.002
Voilà. Problem solved.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.961
I always blamed
your horrible personality

16:02.004 --> 16:04.615
on the hormones
because you were pregnant,

16:04.659 --> 16:07.792
but now I realize
that's just who you are.

16:07.836 --> 16:10.012
Well, you better tone down the
bitchiness for the dedication.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.535
Why do you care so much
about this plaque?

16:11.579 --> 16:13.102
History is the backbone
of society.

16:13.146 --> 16:14.451
You can't hide the truth,

16:14.495 --> 16:16.671
no matter how painful it may be.Please.

16:16.714 --> 16:18.890
You were literally going to let
your child be raised

16:18.934 --> 16:22.024
by a rich power gay
with a fancy last name,

16:22.068 --> 16:23.721
so don't talk to me
about truth.

16:23.765 --> 16:24.984
That was different.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.594
Oh, was it?

16:26.637 --> 16:29.423
Because your lies started
a downward spiral for Steven

16:29.466 --> 16:31.425
that led to our divorce
and left me

16:31.468 --> 16:33.296
with a void in my life
and no purpose,

16:33.340 --> 16:36.604
which is exactly why this hotel
is so important to me right now.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.910
Well, the A.H.A.
is important to me, too.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.390
And I'm not gonna let you

16:40.434 --> 16:42.305
or anyone else destroy it.

16:42.349 --> 16:44.133
When people figure out
who this guy really was,

16:44.177 --> 16:45.656
they might boycott.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.832
It could ruin my grand opening

16:47.876 --> 16:50.009
and hurt business for years,
Melissa.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.054
Well, it's not my
problem. If you

16:52.098 --> 16:54.013
so much as get a fingerprint
on that new plaque,

16:54.056 --> 16:57.059
I'll make sure that your permits
are never approved.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.279
This place will be
nothing but a graveyard

16:59.322 --> 17:00.715
for your money.

17:00.758 --> 17:04.023
Or Steven's money, I guess.

17:07.591 --> 17:09.941
I thought I smelled
sulfur and brimstone.

17:09.985 --> 17:12.161
Is she behind the
permit situation?

17:12.205 --> 17:13.597
Yes.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.470
But if she can use
her power for evil,

17:16.513 --> 17:18.385
I can use my money for good.

17:18.428 --> 17:21.083
Tell the crew I'll pay them
double to work without permits.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.476
I'm afraid
that won't be possible.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.391
After further review
of our finances,

17:24.434 --> 17:27.089
our cash flow
is down to a trickle.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.656
I am not gonna have
my name associated

17:28.699 --> 17:33.182
with a dead, homophobic
architect/city planner, Anders.

17:33.226 --> 17:34.705
You may not have much
of a choice.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.621
You know what?

17:37.665 --> 17:40.363
I do, actually.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.583
I'm selling the hotel.

17:42.626 --> 17:45.238
Find me a buyer. I'm out.

17:47.588 --> 17:50.373
This shade works much better
with my complexion.No wonder

17:50.417 --> 17:52.549
you're handling this
community service thing so well.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.551
Actually, it's harder
than I thought,

17:54.595 --> 17:56.466
but that's only because
I came unprepared.

17:56.510 --> 17:59.208
Today, I have a plan:
imported Dutch soil,

17:59.252 --> 18:01.428
a Buddhist monk
to bless the Zen garden,

18:01.471 --> 18:03.647
and a crop-maximizing plan

18:03.691 --> 18:06.781
designed by Atlanta's
top landscape architect.

18:06.824 --> 18:08.304
Bringing the one
percent to the 99%.

18:08.348 --> 18:09.958
Heroic.If everything goes

18:10.001 --> 18:12.482
as planned, I should have
a version of my garden

18:12.526 --> 18:15.137
done by tonight
and dodge another court date.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.052
Ooh, don't say "court date."

18:17.096 --> 18:18.401
Even with Blake in jail,

18:18.445 --> 18:20.011
I'm a little nervous
coming back in this place.

18:20.055 --> 18:21.100
FALLON:
Oh, relax.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.840
You're not trespassing.
I called you.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.190
And here's why.

18:25.234 --> 18:26.583
Here you go.

18:26.627 --> 18:28.237
What's this?

18:28.281 --> 18:30.631
Well, it's an upgrade
to your portfolio.

18:30.674 --> 18:33.155
It's my shares of the Atlantix.

18:33.199 --> 18:36.158
I want you to know
how sorry I am

18:36.202 --> 18:37.855
for my part
in unwittingly

18:37.899 --> 18:39.335
helping Blake frame you.

18:39.379 --> 18:41.207
So you're now the majority owner
of the team.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.208
MICHAEL:
Wow.

18:42.251 --> 18:44.253
Apology accepted.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.081
Jeff would have given
you his shares, too.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.735
He'd be happy you're in charge.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.737
Any update?

18:49.780 --> 18:52.087
I've been praying
for your family.Nothing yet.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.175
But thanks.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.785
I'll keep on praying.

18:54.829 --> 18:55.960
And I'm sorry

18:56.004 --> 18:58.354
things got so bad between us.

18:58.398 --> 18:59.747
Fresh start?

18:59.790 --> 19:01.705
Fresh start.

19:01.749 --> 19:05.231
Uh, I guess
I got a team to run.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.146
I can't thank you enough
for this.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.277
It's all a part
of my atonement tour.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.760
What's this all about?
Where are you taking me?

19:16.372 --> 19:17.634
Cristal. What are you...?

19:17.678 --> 19:18.679
Shh.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.077
I reached out to your friend.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.427
Warden Aldrich?

19:27.470 --> 19:30.691
Convinced him to grant
us a little alone time.

19:30.734 --> 19:31.692
In a place

19:31.735 --> 19:33.259
with no guards

19:33.302 --> 19:34.738
and no cameras.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.227
This should help you make
it through the night.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.229
Oh, you're a genius.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.405
Money still pays
for some things.

19:49.449 --> 19:52.191
You can put that away later.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.280
Unless you were planning
to keep those pants on.

19:59.459 --> 20:01.156
Here you go.Appreciate it.

20:02.157 --> 20:03.985
What the...?

20:04.028 --> 20:05.595
Frank! Frank.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.380
What the hell happened here?

20:07.423 --> 20:09.512
You tell me, Little
Miss Fancy Plants.

20:09.556 --> 20:11.210
No, n-n-no.
When I left last night,

20:11.253 --> 20:13.342
my vertical garden
was actually vertical,

20:13.386 --> 20:15.823
not some mangled heap
of soggy trash.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.781
Guess it fell apart.Oh, you think?

20:17.825 --> 20:19.479
Leaving the hose running all
night didn't help much either.

20:19.522 --> 20:20.915
Are you sure you
closed that gate?

20:20.958 --> 20:22.264
I'm guessing the
raccoons got in

20:22.308 --> 20:23.700
and had their way
with the trash bins.Okay.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.485
Well, it's not my fault
raccoons are garbage people.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.704
You're still gonna sign
my form, right?Sure, yeah.

20:27.748 --> 20:30.141
Soon as you fix everything.What, like redo it?

20:30.185 --> 20:31.839
There is no way
I can finish this

20:31.882 --> 20:34.145
before it gets dark,
and I need my form signed

20:34.189 --> 20:35.364
in the morning for the judge,

20:35.408 --> 20:37.540
or I could go to jail.Sorry.

20:37.584 --> 20:40.326
Don't do the crime if
you can't do the time.

20:45.374 --> 20:47.333
DOMINIQUE:
Damn it. I can't

20:47.376 --> 20:48.421
find it anywhere.

20:48.464 --> 20:49.378
NAOMI:
Even if it takes a few days,

20:49.422 --> 20:50.684
you'll still get your money.

20:50.727 --> 20:51.989
You don't get it.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.469
Monica is snooping around,

20:53.513 --> 20:55.384
and if she figures out that
that cuff link was missing

20:55.428 --> 20:59.040
before the cops got there,
she'll know I'm to blame. Okay?

20:59.083 --> 21:01.477
We need to get this file
before then.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.740
Once I have the money,
the cuff links won't matter.

21:03.784 --> 21:05.394
Try his office.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.875
If you can get me a copy
of the trust tonight, I can file

21:07.918 --> 21:09.268
with the court
first thing in the morning.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.704
Oh, I got to go.

21:10.747 --> 21:12.793
I'll call you later.

21:12.836 --> 21:14.490
Monica.

21:14.534 --> 21:15.665
You're back.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.058
I've talked to every cop who was

21:17.101 --> 21:18.320
at Jeff's crime scene,
except for one.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.409
And?No one saw a cuff link,

21:20.453 --> 21:23.282
but I still need to talk
to the first one on the scene.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.284
That should give me
a definitive answer.Calm down.

21:25.327 --> 21:26.459
Let me fix you a drink.

21:26.502 --> 21:29.940
All right? You've
got a lot going on.

21:29.984 --> 21:33.944
You've been going nonstop.
I'm worried about you.

21:33.988 --> 21:35.772
You look exhausted.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.557
MONICA:
Of course I'm tired,

21:37.600 --> 21:39.341
but I still have work to do.

21:39.385 --> 21:43.345
But you have to take care
of yourself, too.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.565
And haven't you done
enough for today?

21:48.785 --> 21:50.178
I guess one drink couldn't hurt.

21:50.221 --> 21:51.310
It will

21:51.353 --> 21:52.528
definitely help,

21:52.572 --> 21:54.574
quite a lot.

22:03.147 --> 22:04.366
FALLON: Happy Halloween, Tony!

22:04.410 --> 22:06.063
Maybe, uh,
drop the knife for a sec.

22:06.107 --> 22:08.370
I come bearing gifts
of opportunity

22:08.414 --> 22:09.719
and cash.

22:09.763 --> 22:11.895
I have a tiny little favor
to ask that pays big

22:11.939 --> 22:13.462
should you choose to accept it.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.377
I'm still pretty traumatized

22:15.421 --> 22:17.553
from the favors
your mom foisted on me.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.686
You did favors for my...?

22:19.729 --> 22:21.035
I don't want to know.

22:21.078 --> 22:24.125
I just need you to work
your green thumb magic

22:24.168 --> 22:25.866
on my community garden.

22:25.909 --> 22:28.695
It was tragically destroyed
by animals, and it needs

22:28.738 --> 22:30.261
some serious TLC tonight.

22:30.305 --> 22:34.353
Sure, b-but as long as I get
to trick-or-treat first.

22:34.396 --> 22:35.441
Aren't you a little old
for that?

22:35.484 --> 22:36.790
With my kids.

22:36.833 --> 22:39.009
Another piece of the puzzle.
No, that's fine.

22:39.053 --> 22:40.446
You can't go there
till late anyway

22:40.489 --> 22:43.274
because your involvement in this
must be top secret.

22:43.318 --> 22:45.233
Okay? No one can see you.

22:45.276 --> 22:47.801
Undercover landscaping mission?

22:47.844 --> 22:49.716
Your whole life has been
leading up to this.

23:01.815 --> 23:05.862
The moment this is over,
the cash better hit my account.

23:18.222 --> 23:20.224
Guard!

23:20.268 --> 23:22.009
Secure left,
secure right.

23:22.052 --> 23:24.359
We got a 10-53
in 14D.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.622
10-53 in 14D.
Inmate Carrington is down.

23:34.282 --> 23:35.805
Can I help you?

23:37.459 --> 23:39.461
Oh. You scared me.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.594
I didn't know
anyone else was here.

23:41.637 --> 23:42.899
Well, neither did I.

23:42.943 --> 23:43.813
I'm...

23:43.857 --> 23:46.163
Michael Culhane.
I know.

23:46.207 --> 23:47.643
Jeff has told me all about you.

23:47.687 --> 23:50.907
Although he didn't tell me
you look like this. I'm...

23:50.951 --> 23:53.823
Dominique Deveraux. Looks like
our reputations precede us.

23:53.867 --> 23:57.348
So, what are you doing in here?

23:57.392 --> 23:59.525
Well, grasping at straws.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.091
Jeff has been missing
for a few weeks,

24:01.135 --> 24:03.354
and the police have no leads,

24:03.398 --> 24:04.878
so I thought
they may have missed something

24:04.921 --> 24:07.533
and I was retracing
all of his steps.

24:07.576 --> 24:08.447
Find anything helpful?

24:08.490 --> 24:10.710
Sadly, just another dead end.

24:10.753 --> 24:14.496
I won't take up
any more of your time.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.629
Sorry to bother you.

24:49.966 --> 24:52.012
Culhane?MICHAEL : Yeah.

24:52.055 --> 24:53.840
Listen, I'm here
at the Atlantix office,

24:53.883 --> 24:55.537
and I just ran into your mom.

24:55.581 --> 24:57.496
Wait, hold on. My mother?She said she was searching

24:57.539 --> 25:00.499
for clues on Jeff's whereabouts,
but it turns out

25:00.542 --> 25:01.630
she pulled up information

25:01.674 --> 25:04.198
on some kind
of financial trust he had.

25:04.241 --> 25:05.591
A trust?

25:05.634 --> 25:07.288
Yeah, I'm not sure
what it's about.

25:07.331 --> 25:08.507
I thought you'd want to know.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.858
Yeah. Thanks for the heads-up.

25:17.428 --> 25:18.995
I came as soon
as I heard.

25:19.039 --> 25:20.301
You could have
been killed.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.564
I'm okay. I promise.

25:24.131 --> 25:25.524
Would you give us
a moment?

25:32.531 --> 25:33.706
So?

25:33.749 --> 25:36.230
It worked.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.581
Due to this
unfortunate incident,

25:39.625 --> 25:41.583
plus Culhane attacking you,

25:41.627 --> 25:43.193
the judge has agreed
to grant bail

25:43.237 --> 25:44.586
on the condition
of house arrest,

25:44.630 --> 25:46.632
for your own safety, of course.

25:46.675 --> 25:49.591
Yes, and I have you
to thank for it.

25:51.811 --> 25:53.595
Oh!

25:53.639 --> 25:57.425
I think Billy enjoyed that
just a little too much.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.908
Monica.

26:01.951 --> 26:04.345
I was out printing
missing person posters

26:04.388 --> 26:07.566
to put around town. I didn't
want to wake you when I left.

26:07.609 --> 26:10.264
Guess I was more tired
than I thought. Unfortunately,

26:10.307 --> 26:11.657
I missed my police meeting.

26:11.700 --> 26:14.094
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:14.137 --> 26:17.619
It's probably for the best. You
clearly needed to get some rest.

26:17.663 --> 26:18.968
Well, luckily,
I'm rested enough to go

26:19.012 --> 26:20.274
to the Carringtons'
Halloween party.

26:20.317 --> 26:22.232
Halloween? Oh, that's great.

26:22.276 --> 26:24.017
You'll be able
to let off some steam.

26:24.060 --> 26:26.367
Actually, Fallon called to offer
a moment of silence

26:26.410 --> 26:27.629
for Jeff during the party.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.022
And I figure, if we're

26:29.065 --> 26:30.719
gonna keep up the ruse,
we need to play concerned

26:30.763 --> 26:32.939
sister and mother
in public. Right?

26:32.982 --> 26:36.595
Well, actually, uh,
I have a meeting tonight

26:36.638 --> 26:39.946
and it's time-sensitive, so you
can represent the both of us.

26:39.989 --> 26:41.382
Right?

26:41.425 --> 26:43.079
Absolutely not.

26:43.123 --> 26:45.516
We're a team, Mom.

26:47.736 --> 26:50.609
♪ It's a dead man's party

26:50.652 --> 26:52.567
♪ Who could ask for more?

26:52.611 --> 26:55.526
♪ Everybody's coming...

26:55.570 --> 26:57.572
I may have some
uplifting news to share.

26:57.616 --> 26:58.965
What, you killed
Melissa Daniels

26:59.008 --> 27:00.531
and made it seem
like an accident?

27:00.575 --> 27:04.535
I fear she'll outlast
us all. Actually,

27:04.579 --> 27:06.407
I found a buyer for the hotel.

27:06.450 --> 27:10.367
Oh, wow.
That was fast.

27:10.411 --> 27:11.934
You think I'm making
a mistake, don't you?

27:11.978 --> 27:13.022
Do you think you're
making a mistake?

27:13.066 --> 27:14.328
You seem a bit uncertain.

27:14.371 --> 27:16.939
No. No, it's just...

27:16.983 --> 27:18.549
You know,
what are you gonna do?

27:18.593 --> 27:20.203
Because of me, you lost
the manor and the hotel.

27:20.247 --> 27:22.249
You don't have
to worry about me.

27:22.292 --> 27:25.426
There's always a new adventure.
You'll see.

27:25.469 --> 27:29.648
♪ Of what you can't see...

27:33.173 --> 27:34.696
You got to be kidding.

27:34.740 --> 27:37.568
I know this isn't the most
conventional of meeting places,

27:37.612 --> 27:40.659
but much like our wine,
I really wanted you to see

27:40.702 --> 27:43.749
how spectacularly
we Carringtons do things.

27:43.792 --> 27:46.708
Carrington spectacle is the
very thing we're worried about.

27:46.752 --> 27:50.059
Instability within your family
presents a risk for sellers.

27:50.103 --> 27:53.976
Well, allow me to show you how
stable this family really is.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.675
Fallon.

27:58.589 --> 28:01.114
What a wild coincidence.
You're dressed as...

28:01.157 --> 28:03.420
Marie Antoinette,
and you are Louis XVI,

28:03.464 --> 28:05.205
her far less famous husband.

28:05.248 --> 28:08.904
You do know that Louis was
killed way before Marie, right?

28:08.948 --> 28:10.776
Yeah, but you know the French
beheaded Marie Antoinette

28:10.819 --> 28:12.038
for incest, right?

28:13.517 --> 28:14.867
How unfair is that?

28:14.910 --> 28:16.912
Oh, my God.

28:18.479 --> 28:20.568
Aw.

28:20.611 --> 28:22.613
You look how I feel.

28:22.657 --> 28:23.919
You feel like
a sad, pathetic loser

28:23.963 --> 28:25.878
that wishes candy corn
was sold year-round?

28:25.921 --> 28:30.621
Well, not exactly.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.754
For some reason,
I thought I could handle

28:32.798 --> 28:34.625
whatever the court threw at me,

28:34.669 --> 28:35.975
especially when it was
community service.

28:36.018 --> 28:37.716
And I really believed
that I could do it,

28:37.759 --> 28:39.543
but turns out
I couldn't even plant

28:39.587 --> 28:41.154
a few flowers without
totally screwing it up,

28:41.197 --> 28:43.156
which feels like
a cosmic message.

28:43.199 --> 28:44.548
Does that mean
you're going to jail?

28:44.592 --> 28:47.769
Nope. I'm taking
the easy way out,

28:47.813 --> 28:49.771
just like everyone said I would.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.599
We all do what we got to, right?

28:51.642 --> 28:53.035
Yeah, maybe.
But look at you.

28:53.079 --> 28:55.734
I mean, you're totally
killing it with your hotel.

28:55.777 --> 28:58.475
You chose something
meaningful, and even though

28:58.519 --> 28:59.868
we all doubted you--
like, seriously,

28:59.912 --> 29:02.175
we all talked about it
behind your back--

29:02.218 --> 29:03.524
you made it work.Well, actually,

29:03.567 --> 29:04.699
I, um...Sam, Sam, Sam.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.441
I'm proud of you.You really think that?

29:07.484 --> 29:09.051
I haven't had
nearly enough champagne

29:09.095 --> 29:10.923
to blame it
on the alcohol, so, yes.

29:10.966 --> 29:12.707
Speaking of,

29:12.751 --> 29:16.145
this is a 2010.

29:16.189 --> 29:18.626
I'm gonna need the good stuff
to get through tonight.

29:18.669 --> 29:20.584
Anders always kept
a secret stash in the pantry.

29:26.373 --> 29:28.505
Who do these boots belong to?

29:28.549 --> 29:29.855
They're Adam's.

29:29.898 --> 29:32.422
He left them there
when he came in late last night.

29:32.466 --> 29:35.599
That... bastard.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.645
Raccoons didn't destroy
my garden.

29:37.688 --> 29:40.343
It was one particular rat.

29:45.609 --> 29:47.307
Like I said, the cost-to-quality
ratio is unparalleled.

29:47.350 --> 29:48.743
We're ready to prove to you

29:48.787 --> 29:50.440
that the Carrington name
is still as valuable as ever.

29:50.484 --> 29:53.443
Perhaps we were quick to
judge you and your family.

29:53.487 --> 29:55.358
You slimy little snake!

29:55.402 --> 29:57.186
When does the meddling stop?

29:57.230 --> 29:58.405
And if the answer is "never,"

29:58.448 --> 29:59.754
we should head down
to the gun room

29:59.798 --> 30:01.234
and settle this with a duel.

30:01.277 --> 30:03.323
What are you going
on about now?You hired the divers

30:03.366 --> 30:04.933
that started this whole
Trixie nightmare.

30:04.977 --> 30:06.630
Then you had
Laura Van Kirk take out

30:06.674 --> 30:07.893
a restraining order
against me.

30:07.936 --> 30:09.416
And now you're sabotaging
my garden?

30:09.459 --> 30:11.461
In hopes of what--
sending me to jail?

30:11.505 --> 30:13.507
I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:13.550 --> 30:14.856
Oh, really? Huh.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.684
Your muddy boots
are even filthier

30:16.727 --> 30:18.425
than your despicable morals.

30:18.468 --> 30:21.515
As always, you're not nearly
as clever as you are loud.

30:21.558 --> 30:22.951
My shoes got muddy yesterday

30:22.995 --> 30:24.910
after I took a trip
to the vineyard.

30:24.953 --> 30:27.738
Oh, yeah. You expect me
to believe that? It was you.

30:27.782 --> 30:29.740
Have you ever
stopped to consider

30:29.784 --> 30:31.699
that maybe your little
garden project failed

30:31.742 --> 30:34.049
because you're a selfish,
spoiled little princess

30:34.093 --> 30:36.878
who's never endured a single
day of hard work in her life?!

30:37.705 --> 30:39.359
Excuse me a moment.

30:41.622 --> 30:43.667
I hate you!

30:46.105 --> 30:47.367
Get off me!

30:52.415 --> 30:53.939
I haven't even had
a drink yet,

30:53.982 --> 30:56.898
and people are already
covered in cake.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.769
Have you lost
what's left of your mind?

30:58.813 --> 31:00.380
Those are business clients
over there!

31:00.423 --> 31:02.251
FALLON:
I don't care.

31:02.295 --> 31:03.992
Let... them... eat... cake!

31:04.036 --> 31:06.429
No! Oh.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.825
What the hell is
going on in here?!

31:10.869 --> 31:12.653
Stop it! Both of you!

31:13.741 --> 31:16.483
Daddy, he... is deranged.

31:16.526 --> 31:18.311
I am telling you.No.

31:18.354 --> 31:19.660
And wait. Why are you home?

31:19.703 --> 31:21.183
Did you break out of jail
or something?

31:21.227 --> 31:22.619
I am home one minute

31:22.663 --> 31:25.187
only to find the two of you
at each other's throats.

31:25.231 --> 31:27.059
And in front of potential
distributors, no less.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.495
I was...Hey, no, no. No!

31:28.538 --> 31:30.584
Go clean yourself up. Now!

31:30.627 --> 31:33.282
And you...

31:35.719 --> 31:37.417
MELISSA:
What is this?

31:37.460 --> 31:39.898
The remains
of your construction crew?

31:39.941 --> 31:42.509
It's the closest thing I could
find to an olive branch.

31:42.552 --> 31:44.511
Oh, please.
I didn't leave my other party

31:44.554 --> 31:46.034
to come here and be besties.

31:46.078 --> 31:47.209
Why did you call me?

31:47.253 --> 31:49.472
I called
the Historical Alliance.

31:49.516 --> 31:50.996
I thought if I couldn't reason
with you,

31:51.039 --> 31:53.650
maybe the other members of
the board would listen to me,

31:53.694 --> 31:56.392
and it turns out...
you're up for reelection,

31:56.436 --> 31:59.091
and neck and neck
with your opposing candidate.

31:59.134 --> 32:01.354
A great find like the McCarty
would give you the edge,

32:01.397 --> 32:04.270
but if it slips
through your fingers...

32:04.313 --> 32:06.620
Is that a sad attempt
at a threat?

32:06.663 --> 32:09.666
Well, you said it yourself:
the A.H.A. is all you've got.

32:09.710 --> 32:12.017
So what? You're just gonna
destroy us both?

32:12.060 --> 32:14.541
No.
We're going to compromise.

32:14.584 --> 32:16.412
I won't fight

32:16.456 --> 32:18.458
that stupid plaque any longer,

32:18.501 --> 32:20.808
and the Alliance is going
to list my hotel

32:20.851 --> 32:23.550
as the number one Must-Visit
location in Atlanta.

32:24.594 --> 32:27.684
Well, aren't you clever.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.512
If you're going to force me
to commemorate a bigot

32:29.556 --> 32:31.471
on my property,
I'm going to leverage it

32:31.514 --> 32:32.646
into enough bookings
to pay my bills.

32:32.689 --> 32:34.648
Well, you know,
I have to admit,

32:34.691 --> 32:36.258
I have never seen
you this confident.

32:36.302 --> 32:39.827
It's... unbecoming.

32:39.870 --> 32:42.482
Melissa.

32:42.525 --> 32:43.657
What do you say?

32:45.137 --> 32:47.008
Rumor has it
you were stabbed?

32:47.052 --> 32:49.793
Mm, yeah.
It was a vicious attack.

32:49.837 --> 32:51.708
Oh, yeah.
Vicious enough

32:51.752 --> 32:53.884
to grant you house
arrest and bail.

32:53.928 --> 32:55.147
How serendipitous.

32:55.190 --> 32:56.757
Fallon, I'm really
not in any mood.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.977
I'm just looking
for some peace and quiet

32:59.020 --> 33:01.066
until that party dies down.

33:01.109 --> 33:02.545
We need to talk
about Adam.

33:07.072 --> 33:09.030
Well, at least
you're consistent.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.466
He's out of control.

33:10.510 --> 33:12.512
I am not throwing him out
of the manor.

33:12.555 --> 33:15.210
All right, but...

33:15.254 --> 33:18.300
I agree with you.

33:18.344 --> 33:19.519
Wait. What?

33:19.562 --> 33:20.607
Adam is--

33:20.650 --> 33:22.435
he's obsessed
with sabotaging you.

33:22.478 --> 33:25.742
I don't know why,
but I can't deny that anymore.

33:25.786 --> 33:28.136
Wait, is this really happening?

33:28.180 --> 33:29.746
I'll do my best to keep
the two of you apart.

33:29.790 --> 33:32.010
Thank you.
Hey.

33:33.141 --> 33:34.534
I'm proud of you

33:34.577 --> 33:36.492
for tackling
that gardening thing.

33:36.536 --> 33:38.929
Path of least resistance
is very seductive,

33:38.973 --> 33:40.279
and you didn't take it.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.596
Tony, I need you to stand down.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.207
I repeat, stand down.

33:56.991 --> 34:00.516
Again, I am so sorry
about what happened.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.083
Please know this is not

34:02.127 --> 34:03.998
a true representation
of who we are.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.434
I'm afraid,
if the brand name is poison,

34:05.478 --> 34:06.783
the wine never leaves the shelf.

34:06.827 --> 34:08.568
We've lost confidence
in Adam.

34:08.611 --> 34:11.832
What if Istepped in
to handle your account?

34:11.875 --> 34:14.617
Adam is clearly distracted.

34:14.661 --> 34:16.880
He's really more
of an interim CEO,

34:16.924 --> 34:19.579
but his time is running out
and I'm looking

34:19.622 --> 34:22.451
to take the company
in a new direction.

34:22.495 --> 34:25.367
One I think you'll be
much happier with.

34:26.455 --> 34:29.023
Have some champagne.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.894
I will not take
the easy way out.

34:30.938 --> 34:33.854
I will not take
the easy way... out.

34:33.897 --> 34:36.552
Okay.

34:38.598 --> 34:40.252
Okay.

34:40.295 --> 34:42.689
Oh.
Rot in hell, Adam.

34:44.343 --> 34:45.605
Hello?

34:45.648 --> 34:47.650
Is someone there?

34:53.134 --> 34:54.222
Evan?

34:54.266 --> 34:55.702
Hey.

34:55.745 --> 34:56.703
What are you doing here?

34:56.746 --> 34:58.444
I, uh, you know,

34:58.487 --> 35:00.010
I thought
I'd check out the garden,

35:00.054 --> 35:02.709
see if there was a tribute
to Trixie in any way.

35:02.752 --> 35:04.580
Why are you holding...?

35:06.539 --> 35:07.496
Oh, my God.

35:07.540 --> 35:10.108
It wasn't Adam.

35:10.151 --> 35:11.457
It was you.

35:15.635 --> 35:19.508
I don't think our moment
of silence is ever coming.

35:19.552 --> 35:21.423
It's been two hours,
and all we've gotten

35:21.467 --> 35:23.164
is some bizarre
interpretive reenactment

35:23.208 --> 35:24.731
of the French Revolution.

35:24.774 --> 35:26.646
I've got a better idea.

35:26.689 --> 35:27.821
Hmm?If we want people

35:27.864 --> 35:29.866
to believe Adam is
a viable suspect,

35:29.910 --> 35:31.520
we have to push
the narrative ourselves.

35:31.564 --> 35:33.479
We need to accuse him
of murdering Jeff,

35:33.522 --> 35:34.610
and we need to do it now.

35:34.654 --> 35:36.612
But we have to be strategic.

35:36.656 --> 35:38.440
This is not
the right place.

35:38.484 --> 35:41.748
Seems like
a perfect place to me.

35:41.791 --> 35:43.750
Why don't you want
to confront Adam?

35:43.793 --> 35:45.230
Why are you protecting him?

35:45.273 --> 35:47.232
I'm not.
It's just...

35:47.275 --> 35:49.190
Just what?
What are you hiding?

35:49.234 --> 35:51.149
MAN:
Yeah, Dom.

35:51.192 --> 35:53.281
Is there something
you'd like to tell us?

35:57.590 --> 35:58.591
Boo.

36:03.596 --> 36:05.163
Why did you do this to me?Because this wasn't enough.

36:05.206 --> 36:06.903
I don't understand.No, you wouldn't
understand, would you?

36:06.947 --> 36:08.470
The mighty Carringtons
are never held responsible

36:08.514 --> 36:09.689
for their actions.

36:09.732 --> 36:11.734
That's not true.
I am taking responsibility

36:11.778 --> 36:13.214
for my part in this.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.347
I am trying to make good
on my past

36:15.390 --> 36:16.652
by accepting my punishment.

36:16.696 --> 36:18.045
Yeah, but the punishment
didn't fit the crime.

36:18.088 --> 36:19.481
According to who?According to me!

36:19.525 --> 36:22.267
Look, my family was
torn apart by this.

36:22.310 --> 36:24.051
I was torn apart by this.

36:24.094 --> 36:26.009
I lost my sister
all those years ago.

36:26.053 --> 36:27.620
Don't you get it?
This wasn't enough.

36:32.233 --> 36:33.278
You're right.

36:33.321 --> 36:34.453
It wasn't enough.

36:34.496 --> 36:37.412
I mean, nothing I ever do
will be enough.

36:37.456 --> 36:39.458
Nothing I ever do
will bring Trixie back.

36:39.501 --> 36:42.243
I just thought that maybe
by doing this

36:42.287 --> 36:43.810
it would cleanse my soul
or take away

36:43.853 --> 36:45.507
a little tiny part

36:45.551 --> 36:47.857
of the guilt that I feel
every second of every day,

36:47.901 --> 36:50.599
but... no.

36:50.643 --> 36:52.340
I mean,
I was just kidding myself.

36:55.517 --> 36:57.171
I guess I didn't realize...

36:58.651 --> 37:00.609
...just how hurt you've been
by all this.

37:00.653 --> 37:04.526
I thought it was
just me, but, uh,

37:04.570 --> 37:07.268
I was wrong.

37:07.312 --> 37:08.791
Can you forgive me?

37:09.923 --> 37:11.620
Yeah.

37:17.104 --> 37:18.975
Look at us.

37:19.019 --> 37:21.804
Both asking forgiveness
from each other,

37:21.848 --> 37:23.589
and neither one of us
is even Catholic.

37:37.646 --> 37:39.213
I'm sorry, I can't.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.867
I have, um...

37:40.910 --> 37:42.825
I have a fiancé.
Liam.

37:42.869 --> 37:45.219
He doesn't remember that
at the moment, but...

37:45.263 --> 37:47.308
he is my fiancé.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.310
Right. Right. Sorry.

37:49.354 --> 37:53.227
Um... maybe we can
be friends again.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.404
Yeah. Yeah. Friends.

37:56.448 --> 37:58.406
And, uh, my first
act of friendship

37:58.450 --> 38:00.756
will be helping you
clean up this mess.

38:02.845 --> 38:04.194
Yeah.

38:04.238 --> 38:06.849
I mean, it really is
the least you could do.

38:06.893 --> 38:08.068
Yeah.

38:08.111 --> 38:09.939
Please, just give me
a chance to explain.

38:09.983 --> 38:11.245
JEFF:
What's to explain?

38:11.289 --> 38:12.638
You were snooping
around my trust.

38:12.681 --> 38:14.553
You looking
to cash in somehow?

38:14.596 --> 38:15.815
I would never do that.

38:15.858 --> 38:17.904
But you would drug
your own daughter?

38:17.947 --> 38:19.732
I... You were distraught.

38:19.775 --> 38:22.212
I gave you one of
my sleeping pills

38:22.256 --> 38:24.127
because you were exhausted,
you needed to rest.

38:24.171 --> 38:25.738
How maternal of you.

38:25.781 --> 38:27.653
Don't worry. I still spoke
to the last cop

38:27.696 --> 38:29.219
at Jeff's crime scene.

38:29.263 --> 38:30.699
No one saw a cuff link.

38:30.743 --> 38:33.180
Seems it was missing before
the police even showed up.

38:33.223 --> 38:35.182
JEFF:
Which means you took it.

38:35.225 --> 38:36.488
After all,
you're the only other person

38:36.531 --> 38:37.532
who knew it was there.

38:37.576 --> 38:38.707
That's ridiculous.
I would never...

38:38.751 --> 38:40.492
You know what?
Just save it, all right?

38:40.535 --> 38:41.797
The second Moni called me,

38:41.841 --> 38:43.756
I knew you were up
to your old tricks again.

38:43.799 --> 38:46.802
And I'm not having it.
I want you out now.

38:46.846 --> 38:48.891
MONICA:
Uh-uh.

38:51.416 --> 38:54.593
You may have given up on me,
but...

38:54.636 --> 38:59.206
I will never give up
on the both of you.

38:59.249 --> 39:01.817
That's a promise.

39:17.180 --> 39:18.573
Where do you think
you're going?

39:18.617 --> 39:21.097
Ooh.

39:21.141 --> 39:22.751
Work, baby. Mm.

39:22.795 --> 39:24.710
Yeah, I may not be able
to leave the manor

39:24.753 --> 39:26.146
because of this thing,
but I have to call

39:26.189 --> 39:27.843
our wine distributors
and smooth things over

39:27.887 --> 39:30.672
after Adam's meltdown
last night.

39:30.716 --> 39:32.674
No need.

39:32.718 --> 39:33.849
I handled it.

39:33.893 --> 39:36.112
In fact,

39:36.156 --> 39:37.940
I even convinced Mr. Han

39:37.984 --> 39:41.161
to carry our wines in all
his Shanghai properties.

39:41.204 --> 39:42.249
How'd you do that?

39:42.292 --> 39:43.946
I can be very persuasive.

39:43.990 --> 39:45.861
I am impressed.

39:45.905 --> 39:48.124
I had no idea you
were such a shark.

39:48.168 --> 39:50.779
And I can do more
if given the chance.

39:50.823 --> 39:52.128
What'd you have in mind?

39:52.172 --> 39:53.695
The winery.

39:53.739 --> 39:56.698
I want the same level
of authority as Adam.

39:56.742 --> 39:57.917
Hmm.
As your wife,

39:57.960 --> 40:00.920
I should have a say
in the family business.

40:02.617 --> 40:05.533
Give me power,
and I promise

40:05.577 --> 40:07.753
our dynasty will flourish.

40:07.796 --> 40:09.015
Well, then,

40:09.058 --> 40:13.411
congrats on your promotion,
Mrs. Carrington.

40:15.935 --> 40:17.284
MELISSA:
And even though he was

40:17.327 --> 40:20.113
a controversial man,
today we are here

40:20.156 --> 40:22.724
to celebrate one
of his positive contributions

40:22.768 --> 40:24.509
to this great city.

40:24.552 --> 40:25.901
In addition,

40:25.945 --> 40:28.077
we at the Atlanta
Historic Alliance

40:28.121 --> 40:31.429
are adding this hotel
to our Must-Visit list.

40:31.472 --> 40:33.996
So we encourage you all
to book a room

40:34.040 --> 40:35.563
at this marvelous property.

40:37.609 --> 40:38.958
Thank you so much.

40:39.001 --> 40:41.439
I guess we should rename it
the Homophobic Stairway.

40:41.482 --> 40:43.571
It's a smart business decision.

40:43.615 --> 40:46.226
And now that our permits
have been approved again,

40:46.269 --> 40:47.836
we can get back on track.

40:47.880 --> 40:50.926
This is a good thing,
Sam, you'll see.

40:50.970 --> 40:52.145
Maybe.

40:52.188 --> 40:53.799
But right now
all I see is a sacrifice

40:53.842 --> 40:56.584
I'm not sure I can live with.

41:02.851 --> 41:03.852
ADAM:
Wow.

41:05.550 --> 41:07.247
Looks like someone
had quite a night.

41:07.290 --> 41:09.684
You can wipe that gleeful
look off your face

41:09.728 --> 41:11.425
because I finished my garden.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.253
Yeah. So your request
of seeing me in jail

41:13.296 --> 41:14.559
has been denied.

41:14.602 --> 41:15.647
Well, that's not why
I'm smiling.

41:15.690 --> 41:16.778
I spoke to Laura.

41:16.822 --> 41:19.781
Liam's been discharged
from the hospital.

41:19.825 --> 41:21.000
He has?

41:21.043 --> 41:22.697
However, I did feel compelled
to suggest

41:22.741 --> 41:25.744
that she take him back
to her place.

41:25.787 --> 41:28.529
You know, so she can
care for him 24-7.

41:28.573 --> 41:29.617
You did what?

41:29.661 --> 41:31.097
Oh, oh, oh.
That's-that's right.

41:31.140 --> 41:34.230
Um, if he's with her,
you can't be with him.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.495
Just a little payback
for last night's party foul.

41:37.538 --> 41:39.366
That's not gonna stop me.

41:39.409 --> 41:40.846
Mark my words,

41:40.889 --> 41:43.109
I will find a way to see Liam.

41:43.152 --> 41:44.458
Mm. And did I also mention

41:44.502 --> 41:45.807
that Laura said
that wedding bells

41:45.851 --> 41:48.288
weren't too far off
for Liam and Ashley?

41:48.331 --> 41:51.552
So you better find
a way quickly.
