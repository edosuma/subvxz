<i>In many ways,
they'll miss the good old days</i>

01:14.533 --> 01:18.412
<i>Someday, someday</i>

01:18.496 --> 01:23.501
<i>Yeah, it hurts to say
But I want you to stay</i>

01:23.542 --> 01:27.546
<i>Sometimes, sometimes</i>

01:27.755 --> 01:31.675
<i>Oh, my ex says I'm lacking in depth</i>

01:33.135 --> 01:36.680
<i>I will do my best</i>

01:36.722 --> 01:40.518
<i>You say you wanna stay by my side</i>

01:41.852 --> 01:45.022
<i>Darlin', your head's not right</i>

01:45.606 --> 01:49.693
<i>See, alone we stand
Together we fall apart</i>

01:49.777 --> 01:54.073
<i>Yeah, I think I'll be all right</i>

01:56.200 --> 01:57.493
- Hey, David.
- Hey, Joey.

01:57.660 --> 01:59.370
Your brother's looking for you.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.463
- Hey.
- Hey, David.

02:11.715 --> 02:12.883
Where the hell were you?

02:13.008 --> 02:15.136
- Did you take the truck home again?
- Yeah.

02:15.261 --> 02:18.055
Pop asked you not to use the meat truck
for personal purposes.

02:18.556 --> 02:21.225
- Hi, Mom.
- But you did it anyway?

02:21.267 --> 02:22.309
Uh-huh.

02:22.393 --> 02:24.520
- Do you have the jerseys for tonight?
- Yes.

02:24.562 --> 02:28.149
No, no, no, seriously.
Do you have the jerseys for tonight?

02:28.649 --> 02:31.944
- Yes. Yes, sweetheart, yes.
- Aleksy, hang up.

02:33.737 --> 02:34.738
Yeah, sweetheart.

02:35.698 --> 02:37.199
I should never have gotten
this woman pregnant.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.076
Do not procreate, David.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.705
Reproduction is a very bad idea.
Do not reproduce, ever.

02:42.872 --> 02:44.415
Hey, I'm sorry.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.252
To pay back some money that I owe,

02:49.044 --> 02:52.339
I've built a little hydroponic greenhouse
in my apartment.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.258
You're... You're growing pot?

02:54.341 --> 02:56.421
And you're the only person
I know with a green thumb.

02:57.595 --> 03:00.097
- And you want me to grow pot?
- Yeah.

03:00.264 --> 03:01.932
Right. Absolutely.

03:02.099 --> 03:05.686
That is the one thing missing for me
right now to achieve total happiness.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.229
Getting into a drug ring.

03:07.396 --> 03:09.732
Because the pressure of my wife
calling me every three minutes

03:09.773 --> 03:13.360
because she's about to give birth
to my first child isn't intense enough.

03:13.485 --> 03:14.486
How much do you owe?

03:14.945 --> 03:16.864
- Eighty.
- "Eighty"?

03:17.740 --> 03:20.784
- Eighty thousand.
- Eighty thousand?

03:21.118 --> 03:24.538
When you say it with that face,
it does make it seem like a lot.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.583
How do you get yourself
into these situations, David?

03:27.625 --> 03:28.959
$80,000?

03:29.126 --> 03:31.921
What happened?
How do you owe someone $80,000?

03:32.087 --> 03:34.256
I borrowed money to invest in Newteoh.

03:34.298 --> 03:37.384
- That is a pyramid scheme.
- It is not a pyramid scheme.

03:37.468 --> 03:40.012
- The guy was arrested!
- Those charges were unrelated!

03:40.095 --> 03:42.264
- He was arrested!
- David.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.937
You know, David, I love you like a son.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.605
I am your son.

03:49.772 --> 03:52.274
Which is why I love you like a son.

03:52.441 --> 03:55.611
But if you don't have our new jerseys
for tonight's game...

03:55.694 --> 03:56.779
I have the jerseys.

03:57.029 --> 03:59.323
You gotta have the jerseys.
It's the team picture.

03:59.490 --> 04:00.491
I have the jerseys.

04:03.953 --> 04:05.829
He won't have the jerseys.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.173
Come on, come on.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.307
<i>WOMAN". Your loan has been denied.</i>

04:25.516 --> 04:27.393
But if I don't get the $80,000,

04:27.559 --> 04:30.354
there's people that are
gonna come and drown me.

04:30.396 --> 04:32.231
Can you please put that down
on your little form,

04:32.314 --> 04:34.234
that there's people
that are gonna come drown me?

04:34.316 --> 04:36.318
<i>You do not have
the necessary collateral.</i>

04:36.485 --> 04:38.326
That is why we're not
gonna give you any money.

04:38.404 --> 04:40.531
Basically, then, you're just
a big goddamn pawn shop.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.740
No, we're not a pawn shop.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.868
You're a pawn shop with fancy furniture.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.913
And for all these reasons,
I have to turn down your application.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.623
I'm very sorry.

04:49.999 --> 04:52.584
All right. I understand.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.046
This is a hold-up.

04:56.797 --> 04:57.798
Excuse me?

04:57.881 --> 04:59.591
I said, "All right. I understand."

05:01.218 --> 05:02.678
This is a hold-up, asshole.

05:02.845 --> 05:04.972
- Excuse me, you just said something.
- No.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.725
- Just then, you said something.
- No.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.230
I'm here. I'm David Wozniak.
I'm here to pick up my jerseys.

05:13.397 --> 05:14.440
- I've been waiting for you.
- I know! I know!

05:14.606 --> 05:15.983
I'm so sorry,
but my team photo is tonight.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.151
The whole team has to
have their jerseys,

05:17.234 --> 05:18.235
it's for the whole year.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.611
- All right already!
- Thank you so much.

05:19.695 --> 05:20.821
I really do appreciate it.

05:28.412 --> 05:29.413
Yes!

05:37.129 --> 05:38.839
- A bag?
- No.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.215
Rolling papers?

05:40.507 --> 05:41.759
I grow tomatoes.

05:43.802 --> 05:48.265
Hey! It's a delivery truck!
I'm making a delivery.

05:48.432 --> 05:49.475
You're kidding me, right?

05:49.725 --> 05:53.520
Yes. I swear I have the jerseys,
on our mother's...

05:53.937 --> 05:57.399
Yes! On our mother's grave.

05:57.566 --> 06:01.695
The jerseys are with me
in the truck as we speak.

06:02.946 --> 06:07.242
Hey! Come on, stop! Hey! Hey!

06:07.868 --> 06:10.162
You got my jerseys!

06:45.030 --> 06:46.949
- I know it's late.
- Yes, it is.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.910
But you brought me
such beautiful flowers.

06:50.369 --> 06:51.411
I did.

06:51.829 --> 06:54.706
And Mr. Bernstein takes
such great care of them.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.504
Where have you been, David?

07:00.838 --> 07:01.880
Emma, I'm sorry.

07:02.047 --> 07:04.967
I was trying to pay back
some money that I owe.

07:05.092 --> 07:09.638
I understand,
but why can't you call or text?

07:09.805 --> 07:11.807
And why can't I come
to your apartment anymore?

07:11.974 --> 07:13.654
I never said
you couldn't come to my place.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.895
- Are you hiding something?
- Nothing.

07:17.855 --> 07:20.482
You're sure you're not hiding
anything in your apartment.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.193
Nope.

07:26.405 --> 07:27.865
I'm pregnant.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.003
That's great.

07:44.715 --> 07:46.008
Yeah.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.635
- Emma...
- No.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.638
You know what? I can...

07:52.306 --> 07:53.724
I can do this on my own.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.684
What do you mean, "on your own"?

07:55.851 --> 07:57.477
I want a child, okay?

07:58.103 --> 08:00.314
But I don't want a father

08:00.397 --> 08:02.191
who just disappears
because he gets too busy.

08:02.357 --> 08:03.483
You're unreliable.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.736
I mean, you've got...
You've got money problems.

08:06.236 --> 08:09.489
You basically don't have a life.
This is not a life.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.825
- I have a life.
- You don't have a life.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.350
People who have a life do not ring
pregnant women's doorbells

08:14.369 --> 08:15.495
at 3:00 in the morning.

08:15.579 --> 08:16.997
I didn't know you were pregnant.

08:17.206 --> 08:19.041
David, you would know.

08:19.208 --> 08:22.419
If you just called me
every once in a while.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.392
<i>I</i> guess...

08:38.352 --> 08:42.981
I guess at first, for a second there,
I was in shock.

08:43.232 --> 08:45.275
I mean, you know, it was a shock.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.819
But then, you know, the...

08:48.570 --> 08:52.407
That feeling of fear went away,
and I got this feeling

08:53.951 --> 08:57.329
that this could be the most beautiful
thing that ever happened to me.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.665
Stevie, no. Hey, Stevie, no!

08:59.831 --> 09:02.125
Hey, it's 3:00 in the morning.
Go back to bed. Go back to bed.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.293
Back to bed. Not in the sandbox.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.045
Hey, where are you going?
No, don't go in the sandbox.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.422
Not in the sandbox!

09:09.758 --> 09:11.518
You gotta talk Emma
into getting an abortion.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.761
- What?
- You have to.

09:12.928 --> 09:14.721
How could you say such a thing?

09:14.888 --> 09:17.182
How can you say stuff like that
in front of your children?

09:17.307 --> 09:19.393
My children know that
they're too old to be aborted.

09:20.477 --> 09:24.147
I'm realizing that I might want a kid.

09:24.314 --> 09:27.401
You are a free man.
You do not want kids.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.111
Kids are a black hole.

09:29.278 --> 09:33.657
They will suck up all of your energy,
your money, your time, your hair.

09:33.824 --> 09:35.867
Remember when I had great hair?

09:36.660 --> 09:38.120
I can't get it up anymore.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.080
How can you talk like this
in front of your children?

09:40.247 --> 09:41.498
I can say anything I want
in front of my children

09:41.665 --> 09:42.945
because they don't listen to me.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.460
My children do not pick up on
the frequencies of my voice.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.170
And I'm telling you,

09:47.254 --> 09:50.090
I have a problem
achieving a full erection now.

09:50.674 --> 09:53.677
It's not normal for a man of my age
to no longer have a nice, big erection.

09:54.219 --> 09:57.264
Hey, what are you doing?
Listen to me, go back to bed.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.515
Not in the sandbox.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.184
Don't get in the sand.
Don't go in the sand!

10:04.104 --> 10:05.185
- As your friend...
- Daddy?

10:05.230 --> 10:07.566
No. No, no, no. Hey.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.276
- Dad.
- Back to bed, honey.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.402
Daddy.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.696
I'm trying to have a conversation.
Please stop that.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.573
- Daddy!
- Okay, stop that now.

10:15.490 --> 10:18.910
I'm telling you, I think
I might want a kid.

10:19.244 --> 10:22.204
As your friend and as your lawyer,
David, may I be brutally frank with you?

10:23.248 --> 10:24.249
Sure.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.712
You don't have the skills
to bring up a child.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.673
I need order in my life.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.385
And this is order?

10:36.261 --> 10:38.347
I think this is beautiful.

10:39.514 --> 10:41.516
Daddy!

11:08.251 --> 11:09.419
David Wozniak.

11:12.923 --> 11:15.592
Uh, the back door was
already broken into.

11:15.759 --> 11:18.428
My name is Mark Williams.
I'm an attorney.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.848
I've been trying to contact you
for several days now, Mr. Wozniak.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.107
I do not have a great deal of time.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.359
I shall be brief.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.611
Between 1991 and 1994,

11:34.778 --> 11:38.407
you donated sperm
under the pseudonym "Starbuck"

11:38.573 --> 11:41.159
at the privately-owned
Graboski-Levitt Clinic,

11:41.243 --> 11:43.245
which I represent.

11:43.870 --> 11:44.871
No.

11:45.080 --> 11:48.375
That was not a question,
it was a statement.

11:48.542 --> 11:51.086
We have all the documents
necessary to prove it.

11:53.630 --> 11:59.845
Over the course of 33 months,
you were a very, very frequent donor.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.806
You donated 693 times

12:02.973 --> 12:08.687
in exchange for which
you received the sum of $24,255.

12:09.312 --> 12:12.023
Your sperm is of a very high quality.

12:12.983 --> 12:14.025
Oh, thank you.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.154
I'm sure your sperm is also high-end.

12:17.821 --> 12:18.822
Uh...

12:18.905 --> 12:23.285
Certain complications arose,
which meant that for a period,

12:23.368 --> 12:25.537
Mr. Graboski-Levitt gave your sperm

12:25.704 --> 12:30.167
to all the women in his clientele.

12:30.333 --> 12:33.712
You have sired 533 children

12:33.879 --> 12:36.423
and 142 of them
wish to know your identity.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.591
What?

12:37.966 --> 12:43.138
You are the biological father
of 533 children.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.518
At the time of each of
your multiple donations,

12:48.602 --> 12:50.163
you signed a confidentiality agreement.

12:50.353 --> 12:54.691
Legally, the Graboski-Levitt Clinic
is obligated to protect your identity.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.860
But a subset of your children

12:56.902 --> 13:00.363
is contesting the legality
of those documents.

13:01.531 --> 13:04.201
They wish to know who Starbuck is.

13:22.219 --> 13:24.596
You say that for each
of the 693 sperm donations

13:24.763 --> 13:28.225
you signed a confidentiality agreement
under the pseudonym of "Starbuck"?

13:28.391 --> 13:29.434
Every time. Always.

13:29.518 --> 13:31.770
I always signed the
confidentially agreement, always.

13:31.895 --> 13:33.355
And you signed those documents

13:33.438 --> 13:35.857
before or after executing
the manual labor?

13:36.024 --> 13:37.025
Before.

13:37.108 --> 13:39.236
And you always wrestled
the dragon alone?

13:39.361 --> 13:40.362
Yes.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.697
Frankly, I'm disappointed
you never told me about any of this.

13:42.781 --> 13:45.033
Usually you call up your friends
after you get laid,

13:45.075 --> 13:46.660
not after you wrestle the dragon alone.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.370
But if you absolutely insist,

13:48.537 --> 13:52.332
I promise you I will phone you
every single time I fly solo.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.752
That's an interesting offer.
Unfortunately, way too time-consuming.

13:55.919 --> 13:59.589
Listen, they claim that your right
to privacy should take a back seat

13:59.673 --> 14:02.968
to their basic human right
to know who their biological father is.

14:03.468 --> 14:09.182
It's very complex. Very, very complex.

14:09.599 --> 14:10.725
It's...

14:11.851 --> 14:12.894
It's really complex.

14:12.978 --> 14:16.147
Do you know that this is
the dream of every lawyer

14:16.314 --> 14:18.483
to argue a case this significant?

14:18.650 --> 14:22.112
A case that will leave its mark?
That will stand as a precedent?

14:23.280 --> 14:25.407
My mother always said that
I would never amount to anything.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.867
<i>- I'll</i> show that old bitch.
- What do we do now?

14:28.368 --> 14:31.830
As your lawyer, I suggest you
cease masturbating in fertility clinics.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.791
- Do I have to get a real lawyer?
- You can't afford a real lawyer.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.586
I'm gonna call the Bar Association today,
reactivate my license.

14:37.752 --> 14:38.753
You don't have a license?

14:38.920 --> 14:41.047
I lost it because of a small formality.

14:41.214 --> 14:46.011
Something about a missing dated form
and a bribe. It's nothing.

14:46.094 --> 14:49.806
Oh! Yes, in hopes of persuading
Starbuck to meet with them,

14:49.848 --> 14:53.310
142 of the children in your lawsuit
want you to know who they are.

14:53.560 --> 14:57.647
This envelope contains the profiles
of 142 of your children.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.319
Do not open it!

15:52.035 --> 15:53.119
Brett.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.371
Hey, Starbuck.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.164
Don't call me that.
Can Susan take the kids?

15:56.206 --> 15:58.333
When she's not investing
all her energy in her new career,

15:58.416 --> 16:01.461
she prefers to wisely use her time
sleeping with men I don't like.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.712
Do you have a babysitter?

16:02.879 --> 16:04.130
Why, you need someone
to watch over that envelope?

16:04.255 --> 16:05.465
I know I shouldn't have,
but I've opened it.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.758
Worst idea ever.

16:06.925 --> 16:09.010
I picked out one of the profiles.
I just picked one.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.471
One. Do you know
whose profile I picked?

16:11.554 --> 16:13.098
Andrew Johansson.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.520
We got to go.

16:39.833 --> 16:40.834
What do you got?

16:40.917 --> 16:42.669
- $225
- $200.

16:52.804 --> 16:53.847
There he is.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.355
Let's go, baby. Take it. Take it.

17:02.981 --> 17:05.942
Come on, 13! Let's go, 13!
Come on, Johansson.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.944
13 is wide open! Let's go!

17:10.780 --> 17:13.282
Yeah!

17:15.410 --> 17:17.912
<i>COMMENTATOR". Andrew Johansson
with the three.</i>

17:20.540 --> 17:22.141
Play defense, play defense,
play defense!

17:22.250 --> 17:25.127
Play defense, play defense! Yes!
Do you see him? Do you see him?

17:25.211 --> 17:26.880
He stopped it, he blocked it.
He got right in the lane.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.965
Did you see him get in the lane?
Did you see 13 get in the lane?

17:29.048 --> 17:30.133
We got 13, guys.

17:30.175 --> 17:33.261
Why don't they put him in?
Why don't they put him in?

17:33.470 --> 17:34.929
The game's almost over.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.681
Why are they not... They put him in!

17:38.349 --> 17:39.768
<i>COMMENTATOR". Andrew Johansson.</i>

17:40.185 --> 17:41.436
Thirteen seconds.

17:41.603 --> 17:42.937
Okay, set up.
He's open, he's open, he's open.

17:43.104 --> 17:44.647
Hit him, hit him, hit him!

17:44.814 --> 17:46.274
Pass it to 13! Pass it to 13!

17:46.441 --> 17:48.201
Why won't they give it to 13?
Give it to him!

17:48.318 --> 17:51.488
He's open! Catch it. Got
it, got it, got it!

17:59.996 --> 18:02.248
Andrew! Andrew! Andrew!

18:02.415 --> 18:04.667
Andrew! Andrew!

18:09.380 --> 18:10.840
<i>Those were my genes.</i>

18:11.007 --> 18:13.760
My genes were on a professional
basketball court tonight!

18:14.928 --> 18:18.056
In a way, you could say that
that was an extension of myself

18:18.223 --> 18:20.266
that hit that game-winning shot!

18:20.767 --> 18:22.560
I mean, do your kids play
professional basketball?

18:22.727 --> 18:24.562
No, not to my knowledge.
But I will inquire.

18:24.729 --> 18:25.929
They don't tell me everything.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.984
So, I've been thinking
that we could plead insanity.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.154
- What?
- I don't know.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.115
Maybe you would
not be held responsible

18:36.199 --> 18:38.785
for actions taken
while mentally unstable.

18:39.536 --> 18:42.163
We could bank
on your mental problems.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.165
I don't have mental problems.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.254
I don't have mental problems!

18:49.420 --> 18:52.048
When we're in court,
I want you to say it exactly that way.

18:52.215 --> 18:54.467
One, two, three, Wozniak!

18:54.926 --> 18:56.386
Let's go.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.888
Come on! One, two. One, two. One two.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.974
Big time, big time, big time!

19:01.140 --> 19:02.517
Let's play some basketball.

19:02.684 --> 19:03.977
Come in. Back up, back up!

19:05.270 --> 19:06.521
Hurry up! Come up, up, up!

19:06.604 --> 19:08.124
- Are you allowed to hit the arm?
- No.

19:08.523 --> 19:09.732
Okay. Pick and roll!

19:09.816 --> 19:12.652
Let's go! Back, back, back! D, D, D!

19:12.819 --> 19:14.487
Great steal! Here we go, hit me!

19:14.654 --> 19:16.948
I'm going in for the jam. Okay, not a jam.

19:17.031 --> 19:19.033
What the hell position is he playing?

19:19.200 --> 19:21.244
- A little help? Thank you.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.207
All right.
Why don't we meet up back here at two?

19:26.374 --> 19:27.417
Emma!

19:29.711 --> 19:30.837
Uh...

19:31.087 --> 19:32.463
Give me a second?

19:36.676 --> 19:39.178
I have officially decided to have a life.

19:39.888 --> 19:41.014
I'm at work.

19:41.180 --> 19:45.518
I'm going to convince you
that I deserve to be this kid's father.

19:54.652 --> 19:56.321
I'm sorry, excuse me.

20:04.120 --> 20:08.625
Four days in a row,
I have not had any sleep.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.585
But I've never been so happy in my life.

20:10.752 --> 20:13.463
I never thought that
I would love anyone that much.

20:13.630 --> 20:17.467
The kid poops four times a day
and I think I'm losing my mind.

20:17.634 --> 20:20.094
I think I'm going crazy, because I swear

20:21.137 --> 20:23.139
his diapers make me so proud.

20:23.306 --> 20:25.308
I'm totally convinced that my child

20:25.391 --> 20:27.477
takes way better dumps
than any other kid.

20:27.644 --> 20:29.103
Your brother wants parental leave

20:29.270 --> 20:31.981
so he can spend more time
admiring his son's diapers.

20:32.106 --> 20:34.317
It's the law, okay?
I'm entitled to parental leave.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.654
I had three kids, and two hours
after each of them was born,

20:37.820 --> 20:39.948
I was here, serving customers.

20:40.156 --> 20:43.326
You absolutely have to have kids, David.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.414
What?

20:49.082 --> 20:50.291
My girlfriend's pregnant.

20:51.209 --> 20:52.210
You got a girlfriend?

20:52.418 --> 20:53.461
Yeah.

20:53.628 --> 20:56.756
David, you're gonna love it.
You are gonna love it.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.217
Your kid is never gonna poop
as good as my kid,

20:59.384 --> 21:01.052
but you are gonna love it.

21:01.219 --> 21:02.804
- Can you believe that?
- No.

21:21.239 --> 21:23.700
I promise,
I will only be gone an hour.

21:25.994 --> 21:29.247
No, I won't. Look, I've called everyone.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.043
How many times have I covered for you?

21:37.463 --> 21:38.756
Oh, my God, man.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.258
I'm begging you, man.

21:40.341 --> 21:43.177
I really, really need
you to do this for me.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.388
I can't even talk to you.

21:49.767 --> 21:50.768
Yeah?

21:53.229 --> 21:54.689
Can I help you?

21:57.734 --> 22:01.154
I'll have a espresso to go, please.

22:16.127 --> 22:17.378
' Said "to 90."

22:30.141 --> 22:31.601
ls there a lid?

22:32.268 --> 22:33.478
Do you have a lid?

22:33.895 --> 22:36.439
Usually, you get a lid
when you order a coffee to go.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.450
$3.25.

22:54.957 --> 22:56.197
You could be a bit more polite.

22:56.501 --> 22:57.543
Polite?

22:57.710 --> 22:59.003
I'm a customer.

22:59.170 --> 23:00.671
You're a barista.

23:00.838 --> 23:04.300
Would it be possible
to act in a polite manner?

23:04.467 --> 23:05.551
What the hell are you talking about?

23:05.718 --> 23:09.180
I'm talking about a little "please"
and "thank you."

23:09.347 --> 23:11.808
- A little thank you.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

23:11.891 --> 23:15.561
Is that not considered cool
by your generation anymore?

23:16.938 --> 23:18.189
Who the hell are you, man?

23:18.356 --> 23:20.525
I'm just saying if you
smiled a little more,

23:20.691 --> 23:22.527
maybe there would be
more people in here.

23:22.693 --> 23:23.853
If you want to be a waiter...

23:23.986 --> 23:25.738
Well, there's the thing.
I don't want to be a waiter.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.073
I'm an actor.

23:27.698 --> 23:30.827
I am an actor missing the opportunity
of a lifetime right now.

23:30.993 --> 23:33.663
And you, because you give me
three bucks and a quarter,

23:33.788 --> 23:35.248
you want me to smile?

23:35.581 --> 23:39.418
You want me to smile when I am
totally pissing away my life?

23:40.878 --> 23:42.964
It doesn't have to be a big smile.

23:43.673 --> 23:45.216
Okay.

23:51.264 --> 23:52.890
Have a nice day.

24:17.748 --> 24:19.542
Good afternoon.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.545
I'll take care of the coffee shop.

24:24.839 --> 24:25.840
Yes or no?

24:27.675 --> 24:29.677
Customers come in sometimes.

24:30.219 --> 24:33.181
It isn't always empty.
I can't leave you with the shop.

24:33.347 --> 24:34.849
But it's the role of a lifetime.

24:35.016 --> 24:37.685
Yeah, and how do I know
you won't just walk off with the cash?

24:38.561 --> 24:40.521
You can leave with my truck full of meat.

24:46.611 --> 24:47.904
And why would you do this?

24:48.237 --> 24:52.283
Satisfaction of knowing
that you helped someone

24:52.366 --> 24:54.118
make something of themself.

24:59.207 --> 25:00.487
Bring it back without a scratch.

25:05.546 --> 25:08.799
Okay. People might come in.

25:08.966 --> 25:12.178
I can figure out
how to make a cup of coffee.

25:12.345 --> 25:15.223
All right. Okay.

25:17.892 --> 25:19.018
Thanks.

25:25.733 --> 25:28.903
<i>It is total chaos
in the meat market today, David.</i>

25:29.070 --> 25:31.572
And you decide to disappear?

25:31.739 --> 25:33.366
In the whole family business,

25:33.449 --> 25:35.618
<i>you know you've got
the easiest job, right?</i>

25:35.785 --> 25:40.873
<i>And in spite of having the simplest job,
you manage to do the job badly!</i>

25:41.123 --> 25:43.584
It's like every day you find a new way

25:43.668 --> 25:45.878
to push back the frontiers
of incompetence!

25:46.295 --> 25:49.548
<i>There are only two components
to your chosen occupation.</i>

25:49.715 --> 25:51.884
<i>Get meat, deliver meat.</i>

25:52.051 --> 25:53.094
That's not what I ordered.

25:53.427 --> 25:54.470
It's free.

25:54.637 --> 25:56.138
Take it, it's free.

25:56.305 --> 25:59.100
<i>You're no longer a "deliverer."
You're more of a "keeper."</i>

25:59.267 --> 26:01.852
Why is our truck still full of meat? Why?

26:02.019 --> 26:05.273
Why have you only taken
our meat out for a drive?

26:05.940 --> 26:07.608
- Yeah?
<i>- I'll</i> have...

26:07.775 --> 26:10.111
Tell me who you are
before I call the cops.

26:14.907 --> 26:15.908
I'm the waiter.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.535
I'm the owner.

26:17.994 --> 26:19.328
I do the hiring here.

26:21.330 --> 26:24.917
Josh got called in
for the audition of a lifetime.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.378
Fine. He can look for another job, then.

26:27.628 --> 26:29.880
Sir, it was the audition of a lifetime.

26:30.047 --> 26:31.674
That's not the problem.

26:32.842 --> 26:33.843
What's the problem?

26:34.010 --> 26:36.595
He's not a good actor.
He has never been cast.

26:36.679 --> 26:37.680
Never.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.849
He's a good kid, but he's wasting his life.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.350
He's fired.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.312
Look, this whole thing was my idea.

26:44.562 --> 26:48.232
So, I guess it's your fault
if he can't pay his rent.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.388
I lost my job?

27:20.056 --> 27:21.640
You lost your job.

27:25.811 --> 27:26.896
I got the part.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.023
You got the part?

27:29.190 --> 27:31.067
Yeah, they loved me.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.027
You got the part?

27:33.194 --> 27:35.071
As of today, I'm an actor.

27:35.905 --> 27:37.490
- Congratulations, man!
- Thanks.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.658
Thanks, man. Thanks.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.619
Wow!

28:21.450 --> 28:24.370
I knew it!
I knew you were gonna bail on me.

28:25.246 --> 28:27.456
How the hell am I
supposed to pay the rent?

28:28.833 --> 28:30.876
Okay, wait. No, no, wait! Wait!

28:33.462 --> 28:35.798
The cash is on the table.
I'm four dollars short.

28:35.965 --> 28:37.675
Peter, you owe me money.

28:38.426 --> 28:41.053
No, you owe me money!

28:41.220 --> 28:43.848
Okay, so then,
what are you gonna do about it?

28:44.515 --> 28:45.933
You told me June.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.686
Tell me,
what am I supposed to do now, huh?

28:48.853 --> 28:51.814
Tell me!
What am I supposed to do now?

28:57.945 --> 28:59.947
Miss, don't worry about the money.

29:00.114 --> 29:03.451
You, uh, won your pizza.

29:05.119 --> 29:07.163
Yeah, you won the contest.

29:07.329 --> 29:09.582
You won our, uh...

29:09.748 --> 29:11.750
You won our "Eat and Win" contest.

29:12.168 --> 29:15.087
I don't know what you want,
but this is not a good time.

29:15.254 --> 29:18.257
I'm not doing too well right now,
so can you leave my apartment?

29:18.424 --> 29:19.508
Yes.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.845
Yes, absolutely.

29:25.848 --> 29:27.016
I'm about to call the police!

29:27.183 --> 29:30.019
No. No need for that at all.

29:31.020 --> 29:34.231
It's only that I can see that
you're not doing very well,

29:34.398 --> 29:38.068
and we have a policy

29:38.235 --> 29:41.947
that's very, very, very strict

29:42.114 --> 29:45.618
in the condition in which
we can leave our customers.

29:46.494 --> 29:48.037
Here at...

29:49.580 --> 29:54.460
At Rocco's Pizzeria,
we believe in a more humane pizza.

29:56.045 --> 29:57.463
So, is everything okay?

30:03.552 --> 30:04.720
Miss?

30:21.237 --> 30:22.571
Shit!

30:23.781 --> 30:27.701
Okay, okay, you're okay, you're okay.
You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.

30:43.551 --> 30:45.261
Miss. Miss!

30:46.303 --> 30:48.138
- Kristen?
- Miss!

30:49.682 --> 30:50.849
Let go of me!

30:51.016 --> 30:53.102
Kristen! Kristen!

30:55.396 --> 30:56.939
Excuse me, and who are you?

31:01.902 --> 31:03.779
Are you ashamed to say
you're my father?

31:11.996 --> 31:13.122
No.

31:13.956 --> 31:15.457
May I have a word with you?

31:19.753 --> 31:20.838
Yes.

31:26.176 --> 31:28.012
The good news is that for the moment,

31:28.178 --> 31:31.640
we just happen to have a spot
open in our rehab program.

31:31.807 --> 31:34.184
The bad news is that your daughter

31:34.268 --> 31:36.979
seems totally uninterested
in the program.

31:37.313 --> 31:40.441
Since she is still a minor,
it's your decision.

31:41.734 --> 31:44.987
- I'm not...
- It's a very good program.

31:45.154 --> 31:47.364
We've gotten great results.

31:50.326 --> 31:51.619
I'll talk to her.

32:00.794 --> 32:01.837
Hi.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.131
How are you?

32:04.298 --> 32:06.091
Please sign the release.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.887
Look, I don't know who you are, but...

32:10.888 --> 32:13.515
I'm begging you, sign the papers.

32:13.766 --> 32:16.977
- They have a great program here.
- I can stop on my own.

32:17.561 --> 32:20.064
I mean, I just had the scare of my life!

32:20.272 --> 32:22.941
- Please sign the papers.
- I think the program is...

32:23.108 --> 32:25.778
No, if I do the program
then I'm gonna be surrounded

32:25.861 --> 32:28.447
24 hours a day by addicts.

32:29.698 --> 32:32.326
And I guarantee, I will relapse.

32:32.993 --> 32:35.871
People don't stop using
in these programs.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.499
They stop when they wanna stop.

32:38.916 --> 32:41.710
- They will help you.
- They'll lock me up.

32:43.045 --> 32:46.048
And I'll lose my job. I just...

32:46.215 --> 32:47.716
I just got this great job

32:47.841 --> 32:50.719
and I have nothing in my life
besides this job.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.766
<i>- I'll</i> talk to the...
- Thank you.

33:08.195 --> 33:11.782
I'm going to sign the release.

33:12.366 --> 33:14.952
Worst decision that you'll ever make.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.162
She says she'll be happy.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.415
Right now she doesn't need to be happy.

33:19.707 --> 33:21.750
She needs to stop using.

33:22.459 --> 33:23.836
And she will.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.963
Do you love your daughter?

33:27.840 --> 33:28.841
I do.

33:29.049 --> 33:31.885
Tell her. Go tell her that you love her.

33:32.010 --> 33:36.014
And tell her that you will
not sign that release.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.071
Where do you work?

33:52.823 --> 33:54.366
Bloomingdale's.

33:56.118 --> 33:58.287
- You're okay for tonight?
- Yes.

33:58.412 --> 34:01.582
- And you got my number.
- Yeah.

34:01.749 --> 34:04.626
- Great. You start work tomorrow at...
- 8:00.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.795
- Okay. And you'll be there at 8:00?
- 8:00.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.464
Okay.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.716
Well...

34:11.967 --> 34:14.469
In my life, I have a tendency

34:14.636 --> 34:19.975
to make very, very, very bad decisions.

34:22.101 --> 34:25.898
Tell me that I haven't just
made another wrong decision.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.317
You haven't.

34:30.777 --> 34:31.820
Thanks.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.702
Oh, man.

35:44.101 --> 35:45.102
Yes.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.272
Yes!

35:50.732 --> 35:53.110
Thank you, thank you. Yes!

35:53.193 --> 35:54.194
Whoo!

36:00.450 --> 36:01.451
<i>Wonderful</i>

36:04.329 --> 36:05.330
<i>Glorious</i>

36:06.373 --> 36:09.626
<i>The sum of all your experiences</i>

36:10.043 --> 36:13.213
<i>A living breathing result of the fight</i>

36:14.089 --> 36:17.801
<i>And every night
you spent shrouded in darkness</i>

36:17.926 --> 36:22.180
<i>Has led you to this moment in the light
It's all right</i>

36:24.182 --> 36:25.183
<i>Wonderful</i>

36:28.145 --> 36:29.146
<i>Glorious</i>

36:31.189 --> 36:33.275
I've never even tried that.

36:33.442 --> 36:35.277
When you do it,
it's different than regular Pilates?

36:35.444 --> 36:37.696
That is why notable
notorious Americans,

36:37.863 --> 36:40.824
such as Roger Morris,
George Washington,

36:40.949 --> 36:43.285
Eliza Jumel and Aaron Burr...

36:49.958 --> 36:51.168
I'm a writer, too. I like to write.

36:51.251 --> 36:52.612
- Oh, that's awesome.
- Yeah, yeah.

36:57.341 --> 36:59.676
- You hold me still.
- Taxi!

37:03.055 --> 37:04.306
All right.

37:04.973 --> 37:06.475
Yeah.

37:11.438 --> 37:12.981
Grab my hand.

37:13.065 --> 37:15.943
- Just watch me dance.
- Okay.

37:22.324 --> 37:23.825
Here, just take it.

37:24.284 --> 37:25.535
Wow! Okay, thanks!

37:30.082 --> 37:32.626
How about hitting this guy up?

37:34.670 --> 37:36.546
Yeah! Do you feel that?

37:36.755 --> 37:39.049
have all called the
Morris-Jumel Mansion "home."

37:39.758 --> 37:41.593
- Nice!
- Thank you.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.512
- Exciting.
- Thank you.

37:45.222 --> 37:46.598
It's all right.

37:47.099 --> 37:48.517
No, no. Okay.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.019
Okay, Okay!

37:57.401 --> 38:01.029
<i>My love is beautiful
It's here for the taking</i>

38:01.279 --> 38:05.450
<i>It's strong and pure
and utterly earth-shaking</i>

38:05.534 --> 38:08.412
<i>My love has brought me here
to show you it's true</i>

38:09.371 --> 38:12.833
<i>A wretch like me
You'll make it through</i>

38:16.253 --> 38:17.421
Hey, come on, buddy,

38:17.546 --> 38:19.426
what are you doing?
You never see a girl before?

38:19.673 --> 38:20.716
Wow.

38:20.799 --> 38:23.385
Honestly, really? Just keep walking.

38:23.552 --> 38:25.804
That's what I'm talking about.
Hey, Shorty!

38:26.054 --> 38:27.139
Hello, Ice Queen!

38:27.222 --> 38:29.057
Hey, Ice Queen,
I need a hand over here.

38:29.224 --> 38:30.767
Hey, I need a hand right here!

38:31.727 --> 38:32.728
On!

38:32.811 --> 38:34.229
Did you say "Ice Queen"?

38:34.896 --> 38:37.190
- Did you actually say "Ice Queen"?
- Yeah.

38:37.399 --> 38:38.984
Don't say that!

38:39.151 --> 38:40.819
Don't say stuff like that!

38:41.236 --> 38:42.487
All right.

38:44.406 --> 38:47.242
all called the Roger
Morris-Jumel Mansion "home."

38:50.787 --> 38:55.417
Oh! Yeah! Yeah!
Was that unbelievable? Unbelievable!

38:55.459 --> 38:56.626
Don't forget the money, guys.

38:58.462 --> 39:00.088
<i>And everything became clear.</i>

39:00.672 --> 39:02.632
I had kind of an epiphany.

39:02.799 --> 39:06.678
I cannot be the father of 533 children.

39:06.762 --> 39:07.971
It's not possible.

39:08.263 --> 39:11.767
It is impossible to be
the father of 533 children.

39:11.933 --> 39:14.186
It is impossible to be
the father of four children.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.606
Right! Exactly. It's impossible.

39:18.148 --> 39:21.443
But I can be their guardian angel.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.196
Their guardian angel?

39:24.362 --> 39:26.990
They need me.
They need a guardian angel.

39:27.157 --> 39:29.618
They need someone to look out for them.

39:29.785 --> 39:33.663
And I fathered them,
so it's my responsibility.

39:33.830 --> 39:37.459
So, you're telling me that
your purpose on Earth is to look out for,

39:37.626 --> 39:41.546
like a superhero, 533 children.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.048
I didn't say "superhero."

39:43.215 --> 39:44.299
Out of curiosity,

39:44.341 --> 39:46.021
when you're looking out
for these children,

39:46.176 --> 39:47.469
will you be wearing any kind of cape?

39:47.552 --> 39:49.763
I didn't say "superhero."
I said "guardian angel."

39:49.805 --> 39:52.974
So, no cape, but you will have wings
and play the harp.

39:53.141 --> 39:54.726
I'm starting to feel more
and more comfortable

39:54.810 --> 39:55.894
with this insanity plea.

39:56.311 --> 39:59.981
I do not have mental problems.

40:00.232 --> 40:02.984
Say it exactly like that to the judge.

40:03.568 --> 40:04.820
Thanks.

40:11.660 --> 40:12.661
Hey, there.

40:14.704 --> 40:17.290
So, today is the first ultrasound.

40:19.209 --> 40:21.336
David, look, I need... I need a friend.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.089
- I'm a friend.
- I want that to be clear.

40:24.256 --> 40:25.382
It's clear.

40:25.507 --> 40:26.925
Okay, well, let's get going.

40:27.008 --> 40:28.260
I drank a gallon of water

40:28.343 --> 40:30.512
and I'm not allowed to pee
before the ultrasound.

40:39.521 --> 40:41.773
- So, is that the leg there?
- That is.

40:41.857 --> 40:43.400
Which one?
Which one's the leg?

40:43.525 --> 40:44.860
The white spot that you see.

40:45.026 --> 40:47.362
- And is that the head up high?
- That is the head up high.

40:47.529 --> 40:49.614
- Okay.
- And we're gonna see the arm.

40:50.282 --> 40:52.576
- That's amazing.
- Isn't it?

40:52.742 --> 40:54.035
So, now all the organs are okay?

40:54.202 --> 40:55.787
Yep. Perfect.

40:55.954 --> 40:59.124
I just passed by the baby's head.
And there's the belly.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.376
My God, do you see the belly?

41:01.543 --> 41:03.461
And there's the whole baby.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.046
That's incredible.

41:06.548 --> 41:08.216
David, I'm not sure.

41:09.926 --> 41:11.219
Not sure of what?

41:11.386 --> 41:13.597
Look at them. They're monsters.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.682
I mean, look at that one. Look at him.

41:16.224 --> 41:17.642
Emma.

41:18.143 --> 41:22.647
This is the most absolute beautiful thing
that can happen to anyone.

41:23.273 --> 41:24.983
Who are you? The Dalai Lama?

41:25.066 --> 41:26.826
What do you mean,
"the most beautiful thing"?

41:27.235 --> 41:29.821
And look at that one.
He's eating his own booger.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.656
It's a great source of protein.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.241
Listen.

41:33.491 --> 41:38.455
You are going to be a good mother.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.258
So, here's what.

41:50.425 --> 41:54.137
Since I absolutely
do not trust you at all...

41:55.138 --> 41:58.642
What I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna declare you the father.

41:58.808 --> 41:59.976
- Yes!
- No, David, wait.

42:00.143 --> 42:02.229
I'm gonna declare you the father
on probation.

42:03.688 --> 42:06.566
- "Father on probation"?
- Yeah. You get no slack.

42:06.983 --> 42:08.610
For how long?

42:08.777 --> 42:10.445
Forever.

42:10.820 --> 42:14.491
Will our child have to call me
"Daddy On Probation"?

42:14.616 --> 42:15.659
No.

42:15.742 --> 42:17.953
Will I have to wear a uniform

42:18.036 --> 42:21.206
that will separate me
from the regular daddies?

42:22.540 --> 42:24.501
- No.
- Then, I accept.

42:25.377 --> 42:28.004
We're having a kid. We're having a kid!

42:28.171 --> 42:29.297
Yes.

42:43.979 --> 42:44.980
Your <i>name?</i>

42:45.647 --> 42:47.649
- Earl Monroe.
- And you are?

42:48.316 --> 42:49.526
A friend.

43:01.162 --> 43:02.497
He's over there.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.171
Great.

43:10.672 --> 43:11.715
Thank you.

43:12.173 --> 43:13.758
You're not going to visit with him?

43:15.343 --> 43:16.761
No. I...

43:17.512 --> 43:20.682
I just wanted to stop by
and see him, and...

43:21.558 --> 43:24.352
- Well, now I have, so...
- He would really enjoy it.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.193
Yeah, but...

43:32.360 --> 43:35.613
Don't worry, just say
whatever comes to mind.

43:52.380 --> 43:53.965
Hey, Ryan.

44:19.783 --> 44:22.285
One, two, three.

44:39.552 --> 44:40.595
Earl Monroe.

44:44.808 --> 44:45.934
You did good.

44:47.435 --> 44:49.813
I said nothing the whole time.

44:50.688 --> 44:52.357
I couldn't get a word out.

44:53.108 --> 44:56.611
You were there. You did really good.

44:59.155 --> 45:00.323
Okay.

45:01.491 --> 45:02.617
Great.

45:22.804 --> 45:25.849
<i>In Athabasca, we set a fire</i>

45:25.974 --> 45:28.977
<i>To the world we left far behind</i>

45:29.185 --> 45:31.813
<i>All the faces, we put away</i>

45:32.355 --> 45:35.191
<i>Lost lives float into space</i>

45:35.567 --> 45:38.111
<i>I got a message, I got a sign</i>

45:38.778 --> 45:41.781
<i>Through the wires swinging in time</i>

45:41.823 --> 45:44.868
<i>It's so simple, it's like the sun</i>

45:45.118 --> 45:48.037
<i>Shines down on everyone</i>

45:48.413 --> 45:51.166
<i>Black bird, from the blue</i>

45:51.541 --> 45:54.335
<i>I give my love to get used</i>

45:54.794 --> 45:57.755
<i>Our hopes come true</i>

45:58.006 --> 45:59.174
Sabrina!

46:00.175 --> 46:01.718
Hi. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

46:01.885 --> 46:03.303
- You are late.
- I know, I'm sorry.

46:14.189 --> 46:15.732
Thank you very much.

46:26.701 --> 46:28.286
Excuse me.

46:29.287 --> 46:30.538
Sorry.

46:31.206 --> 46:32.540
Excuse me.

46:45.386 --> 46:47.764
Look, if we really want
to find out who Starbuck is,

46:47.931 --> 46:50.092
we need these guys to help us
put together the strategy

46:50.099 --> 46:51.893
to make sure that this thing
doesn't turn into a circus.

46:52.060 --> 46:54.896
- We don't have the money.
- We can do it on our own.

46:54.979 --> 46:57.815
The objective wouldn't be
to always have them there.

46:57.899 --> 47:01.486
I think if we just take the time
to check out what they've proposed...

47:01.653 --> 47:03.363
I simply wanted
to express the fact

47:03.488 --> 47:05.573
that I feel we were better off
without them.

47:36.104 --> 47:39.023
Yes, gentleman in the blue.

47:40.275 --> 47:41.401
Do you have a comment?

47:50.702 --> 47:53.788
I just want to say that...

47:58.334 --> 48:01.170
I don't know all of you here.

48:01.796 --> 48:03.006
But...

48:03.631 --> 48:08.344
But you're all focused, a lot,

48:08.886 --> 48:12.890
on finding Starbuck.

48:14.183 --> 48:16.561
But, whatever happens,

48:17.353 --> 48:19.814
you're all brothers and sisters.

48:21.357 --> 48:23.776
You've all found one another.

48:41.669 --> 48:43.546
- Hey!
- Hey!

48:43.713 --> 48:45.089
- Hi.
- Hi.

48:46.466 --> 48:48.134
What are you doing here?

48:48.468 --> 48:50.720
I'm... Yeah... You know, I'm...

48:51.638 --> 48:52.680
I'm the father.

48:52.847 --> 48:56.476
I'm the adoptive father.
I'm Ryan's adoptive father.

48:56.768 --> 48:58.519
- Ryan?
- He's not here tonight.

48:58.686 --> 49:00.980
He's at a home for the disabled.

49:01.147 --> 49:03.274
He's disabled,
and he just couldn't make it.

49:03.608 --> 49:05.401
- Hey!
- Hey.

49:06.069 --> 49:08.154
Kristen. This is...

49:08.738 --> 49:10.258
- Taylor.
- Yeah. Taylor saved my life.

49:10.323 --> 49:13.326
He saved my life at the pool.
He's a lifeguard.

49:13.493 --> 49:16.663
And I'm the adoptive father of Ryan,

49:16.829 --> 49:19.874
and he couldn't be here,
because he's handicapped.

49:20.041 --> 49:21.250
You're the father of one of the children?

49:21.334 --> 49:22.377
- Adoptive.
- Oh, wow.

49:22.460 --> 49:24.712
- How's it going?
- Hey, hey, hey, Josh!

49:25.630 --> 49:26.881
Yeah.

49:29.175 --> 49:33.054
- Josh, this is Taylor, and this is Kristen.
- How's it going?

49:33.179 --> 49:36.140
Josh worked at a coffee shop,
and he is now an actor.

49:36.307 --> 49:37.767
Josh, this is Taylor.

49:37.892 --> 49:40.144
Taylor is a lifeguard.
He saved my life a few months ago.

49:40.228 --> 49:42.897
And this is Kristen. Orders pizza.
She is also an ex-drug addict.

49:42.980 --> 49:45.024
And I'm the adoptive father

49:45.191 --> 49:47.360
of a young disabled man
who couldn't be here.

49:47.527 --> 49:48.528
And his name is Ryan.

49:48.695 --> 49:50.363
Hey, you're the guy from the park.

49:50.530 --> 49:51.823
- Hey.
- How are you?

49:51.989 --> 49:53.074
Great.

49:54.117 --> 49:55.910
Josh, Kristen and Taylor.

49:56.077 --> 49:57.078
- Hey.
- How are you?

49:57.203 --> 49:58.287
What's up? Adam.

49:58.955 --> 50:01.999
Kristen has got a great job,
and she's still...

50:02.166 --> 50:03.806
Yep, I'm still working at Bloomingdale's.

50:03.876 --> 50:05.461
So the job, which is great.
Everyone's doing great.

50:05.628 --> 50:08.589
And I'm the adoptive father
of a disabled...

50:08.673 --> 50:10.007
Young disabled man.

50:10.258 --> 50:12.927
Ryan, who was obviously...

50:13.094 --> 50:16.514
Unfortunately, was in conflict
with some of the disabled days

50:16.681 --> 50:18.725
of doing the activities and
stuff that we're involved in.

50:18.891 --> 50:21.269
So, I got the stuff for him.
I gotta run out of here.

50:21.436 --> 50:23.563
But everyone looks good.

50:24.313 --> 50:26.774
- Good to see you.
- Great. Great to see you.

50:31.612 --> 50:32.822
Taxi!

50:38.786 --> 50:42.874
As of tonight, you are officially part of
a mass action lawsuit against yourself.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.361
What the hell are you doing here?

50:45.001 --> 50:48.004
A bit of reconnaissance work.
What the hell are you doing here?

50:48.171 --> 50:49.589
I was following one of my kids...

50:49.756 --> 50:52.383
But why are you doing this?
Who does things like that?

50:52.550 --> 50:54.051
I don't know, I was curious.

50:54.218 --> 50:55.261
- Stop!
- Stop what?

50:55.428 --> 50:57.221
Stop everything for the rest of your life.

50:57.388 --> 50:59.348
Every time you have an idea,
I want you to come to me,

50:59.432 --> 51:01.976
and as your friend,
I will shoot your idea down.

51:02.143 --> 51:03.504
You're not a normal person, David.

51:03.644 --> 51:05.146
I am a normal person.

51:05.313 --> 51:07.148
David, we've known each other
for 20 years.

51:07.231 --> 51:09.150
I can tell you for a fact,
you are not normal.

51:09.233 --> 51:10.401
I'm very normal.

51:10.568 --> 51:11.611
Really?

51:11.694 --> 51:13.279
- What about Mariouka?
- I don't see the point...

51:13.362 --> 51:14.489
Five years ago,

51:14.614 --> 51:16.365
you married a Russian woman
that you had never met.

51:16.532 --> 51:17.784
She needed to get into the country,

51:17.867 --> 51:20.203
and she promised to clean
my apartment for a year.

51:20.369 --> 51:22.914
And she disappeared after three days
with her real husband.

51:23.247 --> 51:26.667
David, how much money
did you lose importing Cuban cigars?

51:26.834 --> 51:28.169
That guy looked very honest.

51:28.336 --> 51:30.129
He was in his bathing suit!

51:30.296 --> 51:34.509
Since when does anybody do business
with a man in his bathing suit?

51:39.305 --> 51:44.143
Listen, for the first time in my life,
I think I'm doing the right thing.

51:44.310 --> 51:45.631
You're not doing the right thing.

51:49.524 --> 51:51.359
Stop seeing your kids!

52:11.796 --> 52:13.714
Where's our money?

52:19.011 --> 52:21.055
I'll get it! I said I'll get it.

52:24.058 --> 52:25.226
<i>It's</i> now $100, 000.

52:25.434 --> 52:29.772
So, I really need you
to lend me some cash.

52:32.275 --> 52:35.236
Tony. It's David. Yeah...

52:36.946 --> 52:38.155
Hello?

52:38.698 --> 52:41.367
Phil! Buddy, how are you?

52:42.285 --> 52:43.786
Rob!

52:44.912 --> 52:46.205
Nelson!

52:47.415 --> 52:49.750
All right, don't worry, man. I understand.

52:50.459 --> 52:53.254
No, no. I'll catch you soon.

53:17.403 --> 53:18.946
Hello, David Wozniak.

53:22.783 --> 53:24.327
All the profiles.

53:25.411 --> 53:28.706
And I saw on your overdue bills
that your name is David Wozniak.

53:29.790 --> 53:31.918
I was sitting behind you at the hotel.

53:32.919 --> 53:34.378
My name is Viggo.

53:36.172 --> 53:37.882
I'm your biological son.

53:39.717 --> 53:41.010
Are you gonna expose me?

53:42.720 --> 53:44.805
I don't know.

53:47.516 --> 53:50.478
I don't even really know
why I ever wanted to meet you.

53:53.522 --> 53:54.982
Who are you?

53:55.858 --> 53:57.401
What do you do for a living?

53:58.527 --> 53:59.904
I work at a meat store.

54:01.155 --> 54:02.365
I'm a vegetarian.

54:04.825 --> 54:06.786
So, you murder animals.

54:07.203 --> 54:09.372
No. I deliver the meat.

54:09.705 --> 54:10.957
I don't murder it.

54:11.290 --> 54:14.210
I chauffeur it around.

54:14.460 --> 54:16.170
Leo Tolstoy says that,

54:16.337 --> 54:18.422
"if a man earnestly seeks
a righteous life,

54:18.589 --> 54:21.384
"his first act of abstinence
is from animal food."

54:22.635 --> 54:23.803
I did not know that.

54:23.928 --> 54:25.179
Sir Thomas More said,

54:25.221 --> 54:27.765
"The Utopians feel that
slaughtering our fellow creatures

54:27.932 --> 54:30.059
"gradually destroys
the sense of compassion

54:30.267 --> 54:33.437
"which is the finest sentiment
of which our human nature is capable."

54:36.273 --> 54:37.525
That's interesting.

54:41.904 --> 54:43.197
Can we keep this our secret?

54:44.991 --> 54:46.784
Can I stay here a few days?

54:47.952 --> 54:49.704
I need to get to know you.

54:50.913 --> 54:53.791
It has only been two weeks,
and he has become unbearable.

54:53.958 --> 54:55.751
Again this morning,
he called me three times.

54:55.918 --> 54:58.629
That's three times this morning.
He's taking up all of my time.

54:58.796 --> 55:00.881
Do whatever he wants.
We can't let him expose you.

55:01.048 --> 55:02.550
Long conversations.

55:02.967 --> 55:06.262
Long, like police interrogations.
He feels the need to bond.

55:06.429 --> 55:08.222
Do whatever he wants,
or he will expose you.

55:08.389 --> 55:13.310
He wants to point out books
that are so dense and so esoteric

55:13.477 --> 55:16.355
that it's impossible
to make heads or tails of it.

55:16.522 --> 55:19.316
And then he'll twist it
and ask if I agree with it,

55:19.483 --> 55:22.194
and then, he'll use it to prove
that somehow I'm full of shit.

55:22.361 --> 55:24.697
I'm not having conversations
with him, Brett.

55:24.864 --> 55:27.074
I'm in a chess game that
I don't realize that I'm in.

55:27.241 --> 55:29.994
And it's exhausting. It's draining.

55:32.079 --> 55:33.080
No.

55:33.122 --> 55:34.373
- Answer it.
- No!

55:34.540 --> 55:37.918
You have to answer it.
Anything he wants.

55:38.711 --> 55:40.046
<i>Hey, I got you</i> a <i>kale salad.</i>

55:40.087 --> 55:41.255
You got me a what?

55:41.422 --> 55:42.590
Kale salad.

55:42.757 --> 55:44.300
I'm kidding.

55:45.426 --> 55:47.762
I got you a triple monster burger.

55:47.928 --> 55:49.430
Yes, please.

55:49.597 --> 55:51.307
Hey, should you be painting like this?

55:52.058 --> 55:53.392
Because I can do this.

55:53.559 --> 55:55.728
I can do the painting. I'm happy to do it.

55:58.773 --> 56:00.107
Thank you for being here.

56:00.775 --> 56:02.109
I'm glad I'm here.

56:02.151 --> 56:04.320
- But I'm excited to do the painting.
- Yeah?

56:04.445 --> 56:05.885
From now on, let me do the painting.

56:05.905 --> 56:07.114
- All right.
- Okay.

56:07.281 --> 56:08.949
I got you some French fries.

56:09.116 --> 56:11.452
- You got French fries, too?
- Yes.

56:11.619 --> 56:13.162
And there might be
something else in there.

56:13.287 --> 56:14.497
Really?

56:14.663 --> 56:16.248
A little treat?

56:17.500 --> 56:19.794
You got me two burgers!

56:20.795 --> 56:22.755
So, I'm trying to cancel
tomorrow night with Emma

56:22.922 --> 56:25.674
and I think I can get off a bit early,
so we can do whatever.

56:25.841 --> 56:28.469
Whatever you want.
Tomorrow night will be Viggo's choice.

56:28.636 --> 56:30.012
All right, I'm off.

56:30.429 --> 56:32.306
Good game, David.

56:36.977 --> 56:38.395
Everything okay?

56:40.439 --> 56:41.482
Yeah.

56:44.610 --> 56:45.653
You want to play?

56:47.530 --> 56:48.697
Yeah!

56:49.865 --> 56:52.159
All right.
Come on, get your stuff. Let's go.

56:52.701 --> 56:55.955
We gotta hurry. Careful, careful, careful.

56:56.122 --> 56:57.683
Do you have any sweatpants,
or anything?

56:57.832 --> 56:59.166
No.

56:59.333 --> 57:01.502
You don't want to wear that stuff.
It's not a nightclub, Viggo.

57:01.544 --> 57:02.744
Do you have any shorts for me?

57:02.837 --> 57:04.517
I don't think my shorts are gonna fit you.

57:09.218 --> 57:10.427
Like this.

57:11.846 --> 57:13.139
What?

57:16.684 --> 57:17.977
Up there.

57:19.395 --> 57:21.021
Dribble, dribble, dribble.

57:21.063 --> 57:22.565
Oh, my...

57:23.190 --> 57:24.650
You just gotta dribble. You gotta dribble.

57:24.692 --> 57:26.026
So, you just... You just dribble.

57:26.193 --> 57:28.696
Dribble, dribble! You gotta dribble!
You gotta...

57:32.074 --> 57:34.076
Why doesn't he dribble?

57:35.661 --> 57:39.707
David, you absolutely have
to be there next Saturday.

57:39.874 --> 57:41.667
Everybody's gonna be there.

57:42.168 --> 57:44.753
Actually, I have plans
next Saturday with Emma.

57:44.920 --> 57:47.256
But you were the one who came up
with this whole concept

57:47.423 --> 57:49.675
of brothers and sisters
finding one another.

57:50.843 --> 57:53.012
Yeah, I understand, but I
already have plans with Emma.

57:53.512 --> 57:56.724
Anyway, I spend a heck
of a lot of time with you.

57:57.266 --> 57:59.685
You know, I also have a real family.

58:04.565 --> 58:05.566
Family.

58:05.774 --> 58:07.401
You said "real family."

58:07.902 --> 58:10.112
- No.
- You... You...

58:10.196 --> 58:12.448
Just because
you decided to turn the page

58:12.531 --> 58:16.035
on that period of your life
doesn't mean we don't exist.

58:16.327 --> 58:20.623
We exist. We exist for real.
We're also your real family.

58:24.210 --> 58:25.502
Viggo.

58:26.712 --> 58:28.005
Viggo!

58:35.179 --> 58:36.899
All I'm saying is,
I hope that you're happy.

58:36.972 --> 58:39.934
I hope you realize that I had
to lie to Emma to be here.

58:40.100 --> 58:42.186
That I lied to the woman
carrying my child.

58:42.353 --> 58:43.729
Your "real" child.

58:43.896 --> 58:46.273
Viggo, we have talked
about the incident a lot.

58:46.440 --> 58:49.568
I don't think we need to continue
to dwell on our little misunderstanding.

58:49.735 --> 58:52.780
I am here. Do you see that I'm here?

58:53.322 --> 58:54.448
Do you see that I am here?

58:54.490 --> 58:56.784
- With your fake kids.
- Fake?

58:56.825 --> 58:58.745
Fake? Viggo, what the hell
are you talking about?

58:58.827 --> 59:00.913
I mean, if we're not real, what are we?

59:01.080 --> 59:03.165
- Nietzsche said...
- Screw Nietzsch-ka!

59:03.332 --> 59:04.583
Screw Kindergarten!

59:04.750 --> 59:06.377
"Kierkegaard."

59:06.794 --> 59:07.795
I think it's this way.

59:07.878 --> 59:09.922
Screw Nietzsche! Screw Kierkegaard!

59:10.089 --> 59:13.092
And screw... The...

59:13.217 --> 59:15.928
You can't even come up with one more.
That's it, you're done at two.

59:16.011 --> 59:21.350
Look, screw all of those dudes.
None of those guys had 533 real kids.

59:27.815 --> 59:30.067
Did you bring me here to expose me?

59:30.234 --> 59:31.318
No.

59:31.485 --> 59:33.654
I want to keep you all to myself.

59:51.839 --> 59:53.382
<i>I know it's coming
I can feel it in my bones</i>

59:53.465 --> 59:54.800
All right!

59:55.509 --> 59:59.221
<i>This is information you already know</i>

59:59.305 --> 01:00:02.683
<i>Even if it's only temporarily</i>

01:00:02.725 --> 01:00:06.395
<i>Give the illusion tonight
You belong to me</i>

01:00:06.478 --> 01:00:08.772
<i>Oh, the things</i>

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:12.860
<i>I will believe</i>

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:16.030
<i>Ignore the hundred lovers</i>

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:19.199
<i>You got hidden up your sleeve</i>

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:22.828
<i>The words come easily</i>

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.788
<i>And they sound so lovely</i>

01:00:24.872 --> 01:00:26.248
You all right?

01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:32.087
<i>I guess it's just as easy if you lie to me</i>

01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:35.215
- Put these next to the grill, here.
- Next to the grill.

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:36.425
Special recipe.

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:38.719
It's a secret family recipe,
but you'll like this.

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.227
Wow!

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:49.813
Do you see what happens
when the tofu hits the grill?

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:51.857
Nothing.

01:00:52.024 --> 01:00:55.569
Exactly what happens when
the tofu hits our taste buds.

01:00:58.489 --> 01:01:02.076
<i>I am alone
I am in love with an idea</i>

01:01:02.117 --> 01:01:05.746
<i>Sophisticated neurological appeals</i>

01:01:05.788 --> 01:01:09.416
<i>I want to negotiate some kind of a deal</i>

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:13.128
<i>I want to tear it open
Show you that it's real</i>

01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:15.923
<i>Oh, the things</i>

01:01:15.964 --> 01:01:19.093
<i>I will believe</i>

01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:22.846
<i>Ignore the hundred lovers</i>

01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:26.100
<i>You got hidden up your sleeve</i>

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:29.561
Okay. Get in nice and tight.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:34.775
All right, we got one more. Get in close.

01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:36.360
- All right.
- Can I get in?

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:37.444
All right.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.074
Okay, everybody, just scooch in.
Get as close as you can.

01:01:42.574 --> 01:01:45.744
Okay, on the left.
Can you move in just a little?

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:48.747
All right. Say, "Cheese."

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:50.541
Cheese!

01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:04.638
<i>And I'm real, real gone</i>

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:10.144
<i>Got me down to the very marrow</i>

01:02:14.106 --> 01:02:17.067
<i>Don't you know I need your help</i>

01:02:19.528 --> 01:02:21.530
<i>You're a friend of mine</i>

01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:24.575
<i>And I'm real, real gone</i>

01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:00.486
Hey. This is Ryan.

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:01.945
- Hey, Ryan.
- What's up, Ryan?

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:03.405
- Hey, Ryan.
- Hi.

01:03:28.889 --> 01:03:30.766
<i>That was the best, right?</i>

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:33.268
I had a great time.

01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:38.524
So, uh... I guess this is it.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.110
Have a great day.

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:52.746
Ryan?

01:03:57.084 --> 01:03:59.795
Could I just have a... Just... Thanks.

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:07.928
.111

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.350
I just wanted to...
I wanted to tell you...

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.401
I'm your father.

01:04:24.111 --> 01:04:25.320
Okay.

01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:28.365
So...

01:04:30.117 --> 01:04:32.286
You'll keep seeing more of me.

01:04:33.954 --> 01:04:36.832
That was a fun weekend. Okay.

01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:49.469
You seem way too relaxed.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:52.431
This is a great moment for me.

01:04:52.598 --> 01:04:54.641
It's a new stage in our relationship.

01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:55.892
No.

01:04:56.268 --> 01:04:57.603
- No?
- No.

01:04:57.978 --> 01:05:01.148
It's really important that you know
there is no truth in anything

01:05:01.315 --> 01:05:03.817
they are going to say about me. None.

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:08.280
You must understand,
they love to humiliate me.

01:05:08.447 --> 01:05:09.948
They're monsters. Really.

01:05:10.115 --> 01:05:12.743
- They are monsters.
- Okay.

01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:19.625
I want to propose a toast to Emma.

01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:22.878
Because I think it's important
that you know that this...

01:05:23.045 --> 01:05:26.214
- Rite of passage.
- Rite of passage.

01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:28.550
Well, it's not just about
humiliating David.

01:05:28.717 --> 01:05:30.260
Although, it is one of the objectives.

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:34.306
And if we have exposed David's past
to the harsh light of day...

01:05:34.473 --> 01:05:36.099
Well, I think it's important,

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:37.893
because you gotta know
what you're getting into.

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:39.645
And now that you know all this...

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:41.355
I have some more pictures.

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:42.939
Not Sniper.

01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:44.232
Sniper?

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:46.318
It was his rock band.
They wore a lot of makeup.

01:05:46.777 --> 01:05:48.904
It was the '80s. Everybody wore makeup.

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:50.989
I didn't wear makeup in the '80s.

01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:53.909
But look, now that all this is known...

01:05:54.076 --> 01:05:55.619
I think it's also very important
for you to know

01:05:55.786 --> 01:05:59.081
that the Wozniaks have had
some wonderful times

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:02.000
- and some hard times.
- No.

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:04.670
Dad?

01:06:10.258 --> 01:06:12.844
When my wife and I were newlyweds,

01:06:13.011 --> 01:06:16.306
we always dreamed of
having a honeymoon in Italy.

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:18.850
But we didn't have much money.

01:06:19.518 --> 01:06:21.395
Then we had children.

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:25.941
We told ourselves, someday,
when we're old.

01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:28.110
But time passed.

01:06:28.902 --> 01:06:30.779
You have to make
the most of the present.

01:06:30.946 --> 01:06:32.547
Do you all make the most of the present?

01:06:32.572 --> 01:06:33.573
Yes.

01:06:33.657 --> 01:06:35.367
Yes, Dad.
We make the most of the present.

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:37.869
When my wife fell ill,

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:41.415
David came over one day
with plane tickets to Venice.

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:44.084
He had seen to everything.

01:06:44.251 --> 01:06:47.671
The hotel near Doge's Palace,
the gondolas.

01:06:48.422 --> 01:06:51.925
Then later, our three sons
flew over and joined us.

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:57.097
We had a big family dinner
near St. Mark's Square.

01:06:57.848 --> 01:06:59.599
David paid for everything.

01:07:00.976 --> 01:07:02.436
David...

01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:04.896
He does things like that.

01:07:05.814 --> 01:07:08.108
If you are able to live
with his countless faults,

01:07:08.275 --> 01:07:11.445
you will also live through
some marvelous times.

01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:16.158
Let us pray.

01:07:16.408 --> 01:07:17.909
- No.
- Come on. Dad, please.

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:19.578
- Let's drink.
- Yes.

01:07:25.667 --> 01:07:28.795
Your father is adorable.

01:07:29.171 --> 01:07:30.630
Yeah.

01:07:32.257 --> 01:07:35.177
I can't believe you brought
your whole family to Venice.

01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:38.138
How did you pay for that?

01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:40.182
I had money.

01:07:40.348 --> 01:07:41.641
When you were 20?

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:44.352
- Yeah.
- Wow.

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:48.440
What kind of job did you have
that would pay for a trip to Venice?

01:07:48.899 --> 01:07:52.778
It was a manual-labor type job.

01:07:55.197 --> 01:07:57.199
That was an awesome meal.

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:00.827
Almost.

01:08:01.453 --> 01:08:04.122
All right, let's bring it.
Open the flood gates, here.

01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:07.501
Have fun.
Okay, have a good day at school, guys.

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:08.668
Have a good time.

01:08:08.752 --> 01:08:11.922
It's okay to like recess. How are you?
Look at these angels.

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:14.841
My man, how you feeling?
Have fun, buddy.

01:08:31.858 --> 01:08:33.819
Coffee? Toast? Eggs?

01:08:34.361 --> 01:08:36.696
- No.
- How was your weekend?

01:08:37.572 --> 01:08:39.241
- Relaxing.
- Good.

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:40.658
Very relaxed.

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:42.911
Dinner with the family.

01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:45.037
And I read.

01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:46.747
<i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.209
That you lie to your girlfriend,
that's par for the course.

01:08:49.251 --> 01:08:51.752
Untruthfulness is the basis of a good,
strong relationship.

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:53.087
But I'm not your girlfriend, David.

01:08:53.255 --> 01:08:55.715
So, before you tell me
that you spent the weekend

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:57.466
with Frodo and Gandalf
and Bilbo Baggins,

01:08:57.551 --> 01:08:59.678
why don't you go ahead
and take a look at this?

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:03.430
Well, as you can attest,

01:09:03.515 --> 01:09:06.643
the reporter won't be winning any prizes
for his journalistic skills.

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:10.689
But apparently,
his story was picked up by CNN

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:14.568
and Fox, and even the BBC.

01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:16.778
Which means,
when you go to bed tonight,

01:09:16.862 --> 01:09:20.615
four or five billion people will be asking,
"Who the fuck is Starbuck?"

01:09:21.408 --> 01:09:23.910
Now tell me, is this good news for us?

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:26.371
Does this augur well for our trial?

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:29.582
Is this the type of situation
over which we can regain control?

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.334
The answer is yes.

01:09:32.294 --> 01:09:34.796
Now, we go on the offensive.

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:37.381
A countersuit.
We, too, are going to sue the clinic.

01:09:37.591 --> 01:09:38.591
What for?

01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:41.761
Substantial punitive damages.

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:45.098
It's the clinic's duty not to do anything
to jeopardize your anonymity.

01:09:45.265 --> 01:09:49.394
By overusing your donations,
they have given rise to a substantial,

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:52.022
well-funded challenge to your anonymity

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:55.734
which has now generated
extensive media coverage.

01:09:55.901 --> 01:10:00.363
I mean, you should hear the stuff
that people are saying about Starbuck.

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:02.616
What are they saying about Starbuck?

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:05.285
Terrible things. But it's good.

01:10:05.452 --> 01:10:07.287
It's fine, because our countersuit...

01:10:07.454 --> 01:10:09.289
David, your debt problems will go away.

01:10:09.581 --> 01:10:11.708
We're going after big, big money.

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:17.964
<i>It is all over Twitter,
it is all over the net.</i>

01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:20.717
<i>No way is this guy
coming out of the closet.</i>

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.885
<i>No way!</i>

01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:23.887
<i>At work,
every meeting you go into,</i>

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:25.096
<i>no matter what you say,</i>

01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:29.476
<i>everyone will always be thinking,
"Hey, it's</i> El <i>Masturbator."</i>

01:10:29.768 --> 01:10:30.810
<i>Five hundred
and thirty-three kids!</i>

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:33.647
<i>He's donated 693 times!</i>

01:10:33.897 --> 01:10:38.234
<i>Boy, this guy was making money
hand over fist. I can't believe it.</i>

01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:41.988
<i>Anyway, listen.
He went by the code name "Starbuck."</i>

01:10:42.155 --> 01:10:43.156
<i>"Starbuck"?</i>

01:10:43.657 --> 01:10:45.909
<i>I think "Chock full o'Nuts"
would have been more like it.</i>

01:10:46.076 --> 01:10:47.756
<i>"Chock full o'Nuts"
would have been better.</i>

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.914
You should read some of these tweets.

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:52.332
<i>The last kid was an accident.</i>

01:10:52.499 --> 01:10:54.709
<i>I guess he was watching
a rerun of Baywatch,</i>

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:56.336
<i>and it just happened.</i>

01:10:58.296 --> 01:11:00.674
<i>I had no idea this could
actually be a job.</i>

01:11:01.508 --> 01:11:03.343
<i>I mean, I knew it could be a hobby.</i>

01:11:05.971 --> 01:11:08.807
What do you think about
all this "Starbuck" business?

01:11:08.974 --> 01:11:10.350
Oh, it's horrible.

01:11:11.351 --> 01:11:12.394
What's horrible?

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:16.147
It's horrible.
You don't think it's absolutely horrible?

01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:18.024
- I don't know.
- What was he thinking?

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:21.861
Well, he obviously wasn't thinking
that they would use his sperm so much.

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:24.030
And he obviously wasn't thinking

01:11:24.114 --> 01:11:26.866
that they would choose
his profile so often.

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:28.201
May I help you?

01:11:28.368 --> 01:11:31.955
Yeah, do you have a stroller
for 533 children?

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:34.708
- No.
- No. No.

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:35.875
He doesn't.

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:39.045
Because it's not normal
to have 533 children.

01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:40.672
It's not normal.

01:11:46.553 --> 01:11:48.680
Viggo, where the hell are you going?

01:11:48.847 --> 01:11:50.557
- I don't know.
- It goes in the back.

01:11:50.724 --> 01:11:52.392
- In the back.
- Okay.

01:11:52.559 --> 01:11:54.060
Hey, David.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:57.731
Your brothers are in the office.
They want to see you.

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:05.697
They wanted 100 grand! 100 grand?

01:12:05.864 --> 01:12:09.993
I mean, Pop didn't have it.
So they tried to drown him!

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.244
What were you thinking?

01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:13.747
Tell me, David, what were you thinking?

01:12:13.913 --> 01:12:17.959
Get the cash, David. Get the cash!

01:12:18.752 --> 01:12:20.211
Unbelievable!

01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:40.648
- Dad, listen.
- Go away, David.

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:47.447
Go away.

01:13:02.921 --> 01:13:04.255
Let's...

01:13:08.968 --> 01:13:10.512
Let's do the countersuit.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:13.473
Excellent. Excellent.

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:15.975
- Come on in.
- All right.

01:13:18.478 --> 01:13:20.355
<i>BRETT". What would happen
if we no longer</i>

01:13:20.438 --> 01:13:22.398
<i>respected these types of agreements?</i>

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:30.323
Nothing less than an unlimited quantity
of chaos.

01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:33.576
Custody battles.

01:13:35.829 --> 01:13:38.957
Possible intrusions upon happy families.

01:13:39.124 --> 01:13:42.460
And this, on either party's side.

01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:48.091
<i>Mothers showing up
on donors' doorsteps.</i>

01:13:49.676 --> 01:13:52.804
<i>And donors suddenly
wanting visitation rights,</i>

01:13:54.806 --> 01:13:56.724
<i>wanting to partake
in important decisions</i>

01:13:56.808 --> 01:13:58.810
<i>about religion, about schooling.</i>

01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:08.278
None of the parties were coerced
into signing this agreement.

01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:11.614
And nowhere have I seen
an expiration date.

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.247
What'd you guys think?

01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:23.751
Why don't I understand
when you are talking?

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:26.337
Well, you see...

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:29.465
This is a complex situation.

01:14:29.716 --> 01:14:31.718
I would vote for the other guy.

01:14:33.511 --> 01:14:37.265
Well... No. The other guy is wrong.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:40.560
Grandma's right.
I think you're gonna lose again.

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:43.104
Did she say that?

01:14:44.063 --> 01:14:47.525
Okay. Well, all right. Thanks, kids.

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:49.402
You can all go to bed.

01:14:49.611 --> 01:14:51.571
Is that going to be
your argument in court?

01:14:51.738 --> 01:14:55.283
That won't work in court.
You can't send the real judge to bed.

01:14:55.366 --> 01:14:57.952
Yes, I can.
Daddy can send anyone to bed.

01:14:58.119 --> 01:14:59.829
And right now, you're all going to bed.

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:01.789
Now, go.

01:15:42.789 --> 01:15:47.418
These are children who are lost.
They are lost in the wilderness.

01:15:47.585 --> 01:15:50.421
And they want to know
who their father is.

01:15:50.588 --> 01:15:52.340
I mean, is that too much to ask?

01:15:53.383 --> 01:15:55.802
And what would...

01:15:55.969 --> 01:15:59.555
What would happen if we no longer
accepted these types of agreements?

01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:06.729
Nothing more than
an unlimited quantity of chaos.

01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:11.818
- Um...

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:13.111
The mic...

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:15.571
Oh, that's better. Is that okay?

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:18.366
Here we are, outside of
the New York courtroom...

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.999
I feel like this is an easy case to win.

01:16:26.291 --> 01:16:27.583
<i>What I'm saying is,</i>

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:32.005
<i>which fundamental right should
take more importance here?</i>

01:16:32.463 --> 01:16:34.757
<i>I've been</i> a <i>musician
pretty much my whole life.</i>

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:37.302
And when I write music,
I write it because...

01:16:37.468 --> 01:16:40.388
I think, when I say this,
I speak for everyone.

01:16:40.555 --> 01:16:41.681
I know, how for me...

01:16:41.848 --> 01:16:44.100
I wasn't actually able to
grow up with a dad.

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:47.895
I would like to meet the guy,
the man, who created me.

01:16:48.062 --> 01:16:51.024
And there's a lot of transitions
in my life that I've come across.

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:54.527
It's central to who I am.
It's really all I've thought about.

01:16:54.694 --> 01:16:58.740
I just want to feel
like I have a part of myself.

01:16:59.157 --> 01:17:01.701
The last ultrasound
that is on Friday at 2:00,

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:03.453
do you think that you can make it there?

01:17:04.162 --> 01:17:07.498
There is no contract, okay?
They've broken the contract!

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:08.791
They break with the contract!

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:13.963
The man signed an anonymity
agreement for 693 donations!

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:15.757
He has a right to punitive damages,

01:17:15.923 --> 01:17:18.323
because you should hear
what people are saying about him now.

01:17:18.426 --> 01:17:19.886
- You have got to be prepared!
- I am prepared!

01:17:20.053 --> 01:17:22.305
Well, then why don't you do it?

01:17:30.521 --> 01:17:32.148
You're my friend, I'm sorry.

01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:33.511
- I'm just so pissed off.
- Yeah.

01:17:33.608 --> 01:17:35.985
So we hope that it has been made clear

01:17:36.069 --> 01:17:39.864
that the intentional blocking
of this vital information

01:17:39.906 --> 01:17:43.910
has had, and will continue to have
a negative psychological impact

01:17:44.077 --> 01:17:47.580
on each and every single one
of Starbuck's children.

01:17:47.914 --> 01:17:48.915
In finishing,

01:17:49.374 --> 01:17:54.295
while the donor may have bargained
for confidentiality with the clinic,

01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:58.257
and the parents may have
accepted that confidentiality

01:17:58.424 --> 01:18:01.886
as a condition to receiving
the sperm donation...

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.847
The children didn't agree to anything.

01:18:05.223 --> 01:18:10.853
Yet, they are the ones,
they are the ones most directly affected.

01:18:12.647 --> 01:18:13.856
This makes no sense.

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:15.900
Thank you.

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:35.962
These are some great kids.

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:51.227
Without the anonymity clause,

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:54.605
none of them would be here.

01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:58.776
And not to have these beautiful kids,

01:18:58.943 --> 01:19:01.988
that would be a great loss.

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:05.825
We need the anonymity clause.

01:19:21.632 --> 01:19:24.635
The court will now take
the matter under advisement.

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:48.284
How long could it take?

01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:54.457
I don't know, David. I do not know!

01:19:54.624 --> 01:19:55.750
What don't you know?

01:19:55.917 --> 01:19:58.586
I know absolutely nothing!
My mother was right.

01:19:58.711 --> 01:20:00.880
I'm useless and I'm out of my league.

01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:04.175
You should have got
a real lawyer, David.

01:20:09.639 --> 01:20:11.057
<i>All rise!</i>

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:22.151
You may be seated.

01:20:26.239 --> 01:20:28.074
In the adjudicated action,

01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:30.660
the parties will receive
a detailed document,

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:35.248
in which you will read
that Starbuck is entirely,

01:20:35.706 --> 01:20:39.961
and without reservation,
entitled to remain

01:20:40.795 --> 01:20:42.088
anonymous.

01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:48.553
He will also be entitled to $200,000
in punitive damages

01:20:48.761 --> 01:20:51.514
from the Graboski-Levitt Clinic.

01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:53.724
You are adjourned.

01:20:53.891 --> 01:20:56.978
Starbuck, therefore, will be entitled
to remain completely anonymous.

01:20:57.061 --> 01:20:59.814
He also will receive
$200,000 in damages.

01:20:59.981 --> 01:21:02.441
Yes! Yes!

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:08.656
Brett,
what's your reaction to the verdict?

01:21:08.823 --> 01:21:11.284
Obviously, I feel great compassion
for the children.

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:13.494
But I am very, very happy.

01:21:13.661 --> 01:21:19.041
I am very proud to have vindicated
my client and his rights.

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:23.963
<i>And I want to say thank you
to my own children and to my mother.</i>

01:21:24.505 --> 01:21:26.215
<i>Mom, I won.</i>

01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:28.134
<i>I won.</i>

01:21:28.718 --> 01:21:33.431
<i>And I just want to say, David, we did it!</i>

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:35.391
No!

01:21:35.558 --> 01:21:36.726
<i>We did it, David!</i>

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:39.729
- No.
- Who's David?

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.862
<i>He's my lover</i>

01:21:48.112 --> 01:21:50.781
<i>who has always been there for me.</i>

01:21:50.948 --> 01:21:53.909
<i>And, David, my darling...</i>

01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:57.622
<i>I love you, David. I love you, David.</i>

01:22:01.709 --> 01:22:04.462
Obviously,
a very emotional trial for everyone here.

01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:06.839
Did you expect this verdict?

01:22:07.882 --> 01:22:09.216
We're disappointed.

01:22:09.884 --> 01:22:11.677
Our case was dismissed,
and we've now exhausted

01:22:11.719 --> 01:22:13.429
every possible legal recourse.

01:22:15.014 --> 01:22:16.682
But we haven't lost everything.

01:22:17.183 --> 01:22:21.145
While we were told today there's no law
requiring Starbuck to identify himself,

01:22:21.312 --> 01:22:24.815
there's more to this
than just legal obligation.

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:27.526
There's us, and there's him.

01:22:28.653 --> 01:22:30.613
And beyond any law,
there are human beings.

01:22:31.197 --> 01:22:33.741
So, ultimately,
the final decision is Starbuck's.

01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:37.912
He's under no legal obligation
to identify himself.

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:40.790
<i>But now that he's seen all of us,</i>

01:22:42.416 --> 01:22:43.959
<i>he may well decide to do so.</i>

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:45.836
<i>That decision is his.</i>

01:22:46.587 --> 01:22:49.924
<i>There has been a lot of
unfavorable comments about Starbuck</i>

01:22:50.007 --> 01:22:51.884
<i>in all of this media coverage.</i>

01:22:52.843 --> 01:22:54.804
<i>We would really just like
our father to know</i>

01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:56.847
<i>that in our eyes,</i>

01:22:57.181 --> 01:22:59.975
<i>he's not a criminal or a freak.</i>

01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:02.228
<i>To us, he's someone</i>

01:23:02.937 --> 01:23:07.024
<i>who gave life and happiness
where it was badly needed.</i>

01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:29.463
Congratulations, darling.

01:23:33.968 --> 01:23:35.386
I had it.

01:23:36.804 --> 01:23:41.434
I had pitched the perfect game
and I had to screw the whole thing up.

01:23:43.269 --> 01:23:45.646
My mother saw the whole thing on TV.

01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:51.986
Well, she must have been surprised
to find out that you had a male lover.

01:23:53.404 --> 01:23:56.198
No. She said she always suspected it.

01:23:58.743 --> 01:24:00.703
She told me we make a lovely couple.

01:24:02.997 --> 01:24:04.165
And your kids?

01:24:07.418 --> 01:24:09.462
- They think it's cool.
- Mmm.

01:24:15.134 --> 01:24:16.635
I'm just wondering...

01:24:18.137 --> 01:24:21.557
And really just theoretically, but...

01:24:21.724 --> 01:24:24.769
If I decided to identify myself,

01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:27.021
would I lose all the money
from the countersuit?

01:24:28.856 --> 01:24:30.524
Yeah, I think you would.

01:24:36.906 --> 01:24:39.700
Emma always says that, uh...

01:24:42.369 --> 01:24:44.121
That I don't have a life.

01:24:44.288 --> 01:24:48.334
So, um, I officially set out

01:24:48.501 --> 01:24:53.130
to try and do the right thing.

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:57.176
It's harder than I thought.

01:25:24.745 --> 01:25:25.913
Pop.

01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:29.208
Pop, I'm Starbuck.

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:33.379
<i>You are El Masturbator?</i>

01:25:34.713 --> 01:25:35.798
Yeah.

01:25:43.931 --> 01:25:47.893
Now, for once in my life,
I'd like to make the right decision.

01:25:48.018 --> 01:25:49.353
Once.

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:52.606
For once in my life, I would
like to be a normal person.

01:25:52.773 --> 01:25:55.734
How would a normal person
handle a situation like this?

01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:58.487
A normal person would
not be in this situation.

01:25:58.737 --> 01:26:03.409
Let's just say that a normal person
had a slight lapse of judgment

01:26:03.576 --> 01:26:07.121
and donated sperm 693 times.

01:26:08.247 --> 01:26:11.292
What would they do?
What would my brothers do?

01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:13.752
Your brothers are not mentally equipped

01:26:13.878 --> 01:26:16.630
to deal with a situation like this.

01:26:17.756 --> 01:26:19.592
When you get right down to it,

01:26:19.758 --> 01:26:22.720
you're probably one of the
few people on this earth

01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:25.431
able to deal with such a situation.

01:26:27.433 --> 01:26:28.767
Why not just tell them?

01:26:30.644 --> 01:26:32.563
As you know,
I have some money problems.

01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:34.607
Yeah, your debts.

01:26:36.108 --> 01:26:40.404
You know I grew up
in terrible, terrible poverty.

01:26:40.487 --> 01:26:41.572
Yes, I know, Pop.

01:26:42.406 --> 01:26:43.407
I know.

01:26:43.574 --> 01:26:48.287
When I left Warsaw to go to the States,
my father gave me $10.

01:26:48.454 --> 01:26:50.414
That was everything he had.

01:26:52.082 --> 01:26:53.626
I couldn't turn down his help,

01:26:53.792 --> 01:26:58.797
so I promised him I'd pay him back
1,000 times over, once I got rich.

01:27:01.133 --> 01:27:02.968
My father died

01:27:04.094 --> 01:27:06.805
when your mother and I
still didn't have a cent.

01:27:08.349 --> 01:27:09.516
.111

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:12.269
I always wondered
what was harder for him.

01:27:12.436 --> 01:27:14.480
Not being able
to give his children enough,

01:27:14.647 --> 01:27:17.650
or not being with them
when they hit hard times.

01:27:18.651 --> 01:27:22.446
My great good fortune in life
is to see you boys every day.

01:27:23.322 --> 01:27:26.116
That, for me, is success.

01:27:26.283 --> 01:27:28.243
So, like my father, I want to help you.

01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:31.538
Here is $10.

01:27:33.332 --> 01:27:34.625
It brought me good luck.

01:27:35.167 --> 01:27:37.336
With $10, I built my empire.

01:27:37.795 --> 01:27:40.005
So, take the $10.

01:27:41.507 --> 01:27:43.175
And also take...

01:27:48.514 --> 01:27:50.015
It's your share of the meat store.

01:27:50.182 --> 01:27:54.353
It's your inheritance, in small bills,
to pay off your debts.

01:27:58.691 --> 01:28:00.401
I'm scared I'll disappoint them.

01:28:00.985 --> 01:28:02.695
Why would they be disappointed?

01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:05.406
I'm a meat truck driver.

01:28:06.532 --> 01:28:08.492
I'm an incompetent meat truck driver.

01:28:08.659 --> 01:28:11.078
True, you are incompetent.

01:28:11.996 --> 01:28:16.500
It takes you four times longer
to deliver meat than anyone else.

01:28:16.667 --> 01:28:20.212
But wherever you go, people love you.

01:28:20.379 --> 01:28:22.172
They're going to love you.

01:28:23.674 --> 01:28:25.300
Everyone loves you.

01:28:28.429 --> 01:28:30.055
Thanks, Pop.

01:29:33.786 --> 01:29:35.746
We'll be right with you, sir.

01:29:40.918 --> 01:29:41.960
Emma!

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:43.962
Emma!

01:29:56.725 --> 01:29:58.143
Mr. Wozniak?

01:30:13.992 --> 01:30:16.829
You gave us a little scare, there.

01:30:18.789 --> 01:30:19.957
Yeah.

01:30:20.666 --> 01:30:22.167
Hi.

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:54.491
Mr. Wozniak?

01:30:57.703 --> 01:30:58.745
Yeah.

01:30:58.871 --> 01:31:01.331
Your family is here to see you.

01:31:29.776 --> 01:31:30.986
Is he healthy?

01:31:32.404 --> 01:31:33.530
Yes.

01:31:35.157 --> 01:31:36.992
Does that mean he can work tomorrow?

01:32:22.621 --> 01:32:23.664
This is weird.

01:32:32.631 --> 01:32:33.966
<i>He'! -</i>

01:32:36.009 --> 01:32:37.427
I lied to you.

01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:40.097
I am your biological father.

01:32:47.312 --> 01:32:49.481
And you have a little brother.

01:32:50.065 --> 01:32:54.194
He was in a bit of a hurry. But...

01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:59.574
He's doing very, very, very well.

01:32:59.908 --> 01:33:00.993
Can we see him?

01:33:05.497 --> 01:33:07.082
I'll find out.

01:33:25.017 --> 01:33:26.059
<i>He'! -</i>

01:33:30.439 --> 01:33:31.857
He's so small.

01:33:32.691 --> 01:33:33.817
Emma.

01:33:40.699 --> 01:33:41.908
Will you marry me?

01:33:44.703 --> 01:33:47.372
Wouldn't you want to wait and see
if I get my figure back?

01:33:49.249 --> 01:33:53.378
If you stay flabby,
I promise I'll get flabby as well.

01:33:54.379 --> 01:33:56.381
I wonder if that's
the first time the word "flabby"

01:33:56.465 --> 01:33:58.550
has been used in a marriage proposal.

01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:13.899
Emma...

01:34:17.069 --> 01:34:18.236
I'm Starbuck.

01:34:31.833 --> 01:34:33.627
Why are you always scamming?

01:34:34.419 --> 01:34:37.798
God, how could you think
that a marriage proposal

01:34:37.964 --> 01:34:43.261
would excuse the fact that
you're the father of 533 children?

01:34:43.428 --> 01:34:45.722
David! God!

01:34:47.891 --> 01:34:49.101
How...

01:34:49.518 --> 01:34:52.687
This is no longer your child.

01:34:53.355 --> 01:34:57.025
I want to be very clear on two points.

01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:58.527
The first point.

01:34:58.693 --> 01:35:00.779
I said I was gonna change
as quickly as possible,

01:35:00.862 --> 01:35:01.947
and I am doing that.

01:35:02.239 --> 01:35:05.117
I've had a chance to do a lot of thinking.
A lot!

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:08.453
And I've come to the conclusion
that it's not anyone but me

01:35:08.537 --> 01:35:10.997
who can decide if I am the father or not.

01:35:11.164 --> 01:35:14.418
Not a judge, not my family, not Dr. Phil,

01:35:14.584 --> 01:35:16.545
and in the end, not you.

01:35:16.711 --> 01:35:21.675
In other words, nobody but the father
can decide if he is the father or not.

01:35:21.842 --> 01:35:25.720
And I, David Wozniak,
am the father of this child.

01:35:26.596 --> 01:35:31.351
The other reality that can't be changed
is the fact that I am Starbuck.

01:35:31.518 --> 01:35:33.854
Now, this, obviously,
can be somewhat frightening

01:35:33.937 --> 01:35:38.066
since it's something totally new,
and no one on this planet

01:35:38.150 --> 01:35:40.819
has ever experienced it before. It's...

01:35:41.778 --> 01:35:44.990
It is like the first steps
on the moon.

01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:48.910
But despite a few drawbacks,

01:35:49.077 --> 01:35:51.371
I think that we can
actually take away from this

01:35:51.496 --> 01:35:54.166
a tremendous amount of joy.

01:35:54.791 --> 01:35:59.296
Not to mention,
vast amounts of free babysitting.

01:36:00.422 --> 01:36:02.507
I don't know how this is gonna work out.

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:05.051
Right now, me coming out
and revealing who I am,

01:36:05.177 --> 01:36:06.761
I'm risking everything.

01:36:06.928 --> 01:36:12.476
I'm risking all for the well-being
of my 533 kids.

01:36:12.851 --> 01:36:15.270
And I would think
that you seeing me risk all

01:36:15.437 --> 01:36:17.606
should convince you
that whatever happens,

01:36:18.732 --> 01:36:23.028
that no matter what turmoil this kid
right here gets into, I will be there.

01:36:23.862 --> 01:36:26.823
Now, you asked me to have a life.

01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:30.535
Well, here it is. This is my life.

01:36:32.370 --> 01:36:35.957
It may be a bit strange.

01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:38.293
And a bit oversized.

01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:42.589
But it's my life.

01:36:44.549 --> 01:36:46.343
The second point.

01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:48.011
That was a very long first point.

01:36:48.178 --> 01:36:52.349
The first point was long.
The second point...

01:36:52.516 --> 01:36:56.895
The marriage proposal was not a scam.

01:36:59.648 --> 01:37:01.775
The second point was much shorter.

01:37:02.609 --> 01:37:04.903
I need you in my life.

01:37:24.673 --> 01:37:27.842
Promise me,
one day you'll take me to Venice.

01:37:41.731 --> 01:37:43.191
Okay.

01:37:43.275 --> 01:37:45.527
<i>The world is yours</i>

01:37:48.405 --> 01:37:50.782
<i>Hold it close</i>

01:37:50.824 --> 01:37:53.868
<i>With open arms</i>

01:37:54.494 --> 01:37:55.996
<i>Little feet</i>

01:37:58.915 --> 01:38:01.334
<i>We've miles ahead</i>

01:38:04.588 --> 01:38:06.715
<i>Take it slow</i>

01:38:06.965 --> 01:38:08.008
<i>See it all</i>

01:38:08.091 --> 01:38:09.134
Wow.

01:38:10.051 --> 01:38:12.095
<i>Take it in</i>

01:38:15.432 --> 01:38:19.019
<i>I see me in you</i>

01:38:20.770 --> 01:38:22.981
<i>You in me</i>

01:38:26.234 --> 01:38:29.321
<i>I see me in you</i>

01:38:31.448 --> 01:38:33.825
<i>You in me</i>

01:38:36.494 --> 01:38:39.539
<i>I see it in your eyes</i>

01:38:41.833 --> 01:38:45.128
<i>I see it in your eyes</i>

01:38:48.173 --> 01:38:50.425
<i>Little heart</i>

01:38:53.178 --> 01:38:55.513
<i>Dance it out</i>

01:38:58.016 --> 01:39:00.268
<i>The ins and outs won't bring you down</i>

01:39:00.352 --> 01:39:01.436
Okay. Have fun.

01:39:04.522 --> 01:39:06.274
<i>Little dream</i>

01:39:09.361 --> 01:39:11.488
<i>Grow up tall</i>

01:39:14.491 --> 01:39:19.537
<i>With a little rain, a little sun</i>

01:39:20.038 --> 01:39:22.791
<i>You'll feel loved</i>

01:39:25.543 --> 01:39:29.172
Many thanks,
from your entire real family.

01:39:33.051 --> 01:39:36.179
<i>I see it in your eyes</i>

01:39:39.557 --> 01:39:41.976
<i>Little hands</i>

01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:49.442
<i>Hold it close with open arms</i>

01:39:50.318 --> 01:39:52.237
<i>Little hands</i>

01:40:01.621 --> 01:40:04.541
<i>The light of love</i>

01:40:04.708 --> 01:40:07.544
<i>Oh, light of love</i>

01:40:08.169 --> 01:40:11.256
<i>Won't you shine on me</i>

01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:14.759
<i>Won't you shine on me</i>

01:40:14.801 --> 01:40:18.430
<i>Light of love</i>

01:40:19.389 --> 01:40:22.434
<i>Oh, won't you burn</i>

01:40:22.851 --> 01:40:25.812
<i>Won't you burn it for me</i>

01:40:26.479 --> 01:40:29.190
<i>Won't you burn it for me</i>

01:40:29.274 --> 01:40:33.319
<i>The light of love</i>

01:40:38.491 --> 01:40:41.870

01:40:41.953 --> 01:40:47.125

01:41:16.821 --> 01:41:19.491
