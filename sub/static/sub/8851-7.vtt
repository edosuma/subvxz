04:02.700 --> 04:04.675
{pub}Is he alive, Ma'am?

04:04.800 --> 04:06.366
Excuse me.

04:08.468 --> 04:11.585
Mr. Toole.
Gentlemen.

04:11.751 --> 04:15.088
Mr. Durant is currently seeking
medical treatment in Chicago.

04:15.710 --> 04:17.245
So you don't really know.

04:19.817 --> 04:21.845
No. I've not had word yet.

04:22.011 --> 04:24.014
What if he dies?
Where's that leave us?

04:24.180 --> 04:26.266
Well, if...

04:26.432 --> 04:28.176
I heard he was already dead
when his train pulled out.

04:28.342 --> 04:30.741
Look, work will not be interrupted.

04:30.866 --> 04:32.397
Progress will continue.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.065
Can we count on the wages?

04:34.231 --> 04:37.819
Yes. Yes. You'll all be
paid on time and in full.

04:37.985 --> 04:39.415
And how will you pay us
if the old man dies?

04:39.540 --> 04:40.989
Mr. Toole...
All due respect, Ma'am,

04:41.155 --> 04:42.449
but you don't have
that kind of power.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.076
Y'all shut up and get back to work.

04:45.242 --> 04:47.996
Mr. Toole, get these men
out to the depot.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.956
We got lumber to load this morning.
Let's get to it.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.959
Right.
Let's go, fellas.

04:53.125 --> 04:56.046
[Indistinct murmuring]

04:59.535 --> 05:01.948
Are you looking for someone?

05:02.073 --> 05:03.261
What?

05:03.427 --> 05:07.356
You've been staring out that window.

05:07.481 --> 05:10.759
Yeah.

05:10.884 --> 05:13.355
Sorry about your friend.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.273
Dr. Whitehead.

05:18.059 --> 05:19.426
[Sighs]

05:24.301 --> 05:25.825
We got a bridge to build.

05:25.991 --> 05:27.901
Yes.

05:32.067 --> 05:33.333
[Sighs]

05:43.978 --> 05:46.146
[Indistinct shouting in background]

05:51.689 --> 05:54.692
Thank you for coming, Mr. Bohannon.

05:56.595 --> 05:57.983
No one else did.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.480
My father was very fond of you.

06:03.605 --> 06:07.483
He said you and he
were kindred spirits.

06:07.608 --> 06:09.973
I guess you could say that.

06:12.444 --> 06:14.791
We both saw more than
our share of bloodshed.

06:19.378 --> 06:21.316
[Clears throat]

06:25.622 --> 06:26.845
Miss Ruth...

06:33.694 --> 06:36.771
I'm the one who put the
knife in Joseph's hand.

06:39.236 --> 06:41.237
[Grunts]

06:43.275 --> 06:47.858
It doesn't matter, Mr. Bohannon.

06:47.983 --> 06:49.534
My father got what he wanted.

06:51.717 --> 06:54.080
Once, he wanted to be a Christian.

06:54.246 --> 06:56.300
In the end,

06:56.425 --> 06:58.960
what he really wanted
was to be a martyr.

06:59.126 --> 07:01.061
[Sniffs]

07:10.675 --> 07:12.677
[Sniffles]

07:18.217 --> 07:21.066
You didn't kill
my father, Mr. Bohannon.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.860
And you didn't kill
your friend, the doctor.

07:24.026 --> 07:26.954
They chose their deaths.

07:29.759 --> 07:32.569
You believe, uh...

07:32.694 --> 07:35.170
The soul can find peace

07:35.295 --> 07:37.174
after all he done?

07:37.299 --> 07:41.378
I want to believe he was redeemable.

07:41.544 --> 07:46.116
I thought we was all
supposed to be redeemable.

07:46.241 --> 07:47.884
The truth is,

07:48.050 --> 07:53.556
I think some people are
beyond redemption.

07:57.249 --> 07:58.478
[Train whistle blows]

07:58.644 --> 08:00.158
Toole: Get that lumber
loaded onto that car!

08:00.283 --> 08:02.482
You want spuds,
you got to work for 'em.

08:02.648 --> 08:03.692
Daylight's a-wasting.

08:03.817 --> 08:07.597
Mr. Toole.

08:07.722 --> 08:09.931
[Train whistle blows]

08:10.056 --> 08:11.798
I'm working.

08:11.923 --> 08:13.023
You got any word from Eva yet?

08:13.367 --> 08:15.638
I might've, and mightn't've.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.789
Either way, I don't think
it's any of your concern.

08:18.463 --> 08:21.584
Like it or not, you know
exactly why it's my concern.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.962
You come here to
throw that in me face?

08:24.128 --> 08:26.608
I come here 'cause I care about her.

08:26.733 --> 08:27.674
Same as you do.

08:28.334 --> 08:30.110
Jesus, am I supposed to
stand here and take this?

08:30.235 --> 08:32.220
I'm her husband, for God's sake.

08:36.277 --> 08:40.386
Ain't many husbands would have
stood this the way you have.

08:40.511 --> 08:42.063
It can't be easy.

08:42.229 --> 08:46.568
So, you've come to thank me, then, Mr.
Ferguson?

08:48.519 --> 08:50.755
Don't push your luck.

09:02.169 --> 09:04.844
You sent for me, Mrs. Lily Bell?

09:04.969 --> 09:07.755
[Sighs] I did. Thank you
for coming so quickly.

09:07.921 --> 09:10.508
Mr. Gunderson, I need your help

09:10.674 --> 09:13.251
during Mr. Durant's absence.

09:13.376 --> 09:17.456
It may only be temporary, but
a welcome change, I'm sure.

09:17.581 --> 09:22.457
Jah. I'm sorry for what
has befallen Mr. Durant.

09:22.582 --> 09:26.663
I am happy to help
any way I can, Ma'am.

09:26.788 --> 09:28.026
Great.

09:28.192 --> 09:32.030
Oh! Uh, so, tell me, Jah,

09:32.196 --> 09:36.242
what is this problem?

09:39.005 --> 09:42.707
These are the problems.
[Grunts]

09:42.873 --> 09:45.522
I was hoping

09:45.647 --> 09:46.891
you could help me...

09:47.016 --> 09:48.463
Whoa.

09:51.819 --> 09:53.885
Can you make sense of these books?

09:54.051 --> 09:56.888
Yes. [Chuckles]

09:58.027 --> 09:59.641
[Bell ringing]

09:59.807 --> 10:01.996
[Indistinct shouting]

10:03.933 --> 10:07.182
What, you're giving it away, Sean?

10:07.307 --> 10:09.220
It's a good deed for
the Church, Mick.

10:09.345 --> 10:10.693
More like for miss Ruth, I'd say.

10:10.859 --> 10:13.795
She is the Church
in this godforsaken pit,

10:13.920 --> 10:15.204
protestant or not.

10:15.329 --> 10:16.637
She's got your head
all twisted about...

10:16.762 --> 10:18.326
Her father was just killed.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.510
Where's your sense of charity?

10:19.576 --> 10:20.972
I have a sense of charity,

10:21.097 --> 10:22.973
but you didn't ask me about it first.

10:23.098 --> 10:24.975
We're supposed to be
partners, Sean, you and me.

10:25.100 --> 10:26.476
You didn't even ask.

10:26.601 --> 10:27.911
Can we help you with something?

10:28.036 --> 10:29.796
I don't know.
Maybe.

10:30.472 --> 10:34.983
Heard y'all killers want to take that
starlight saloon for yourselves.

10:35.108 --> 10:36.719
And why should you care?

10:36.885 --> 10:39.013
'Cause I can help.

10:39.179 --> 10:41.849
Carl's not keen to sell.

10:42.015 --> 10:43.634
He's locked up with a couple
of them krauts as well

10:43.800 --> 10:44.788
for protection.

10:44.913 --> 10:46.256
Since when y'all become scared

10:46.381 --> 10:47.825
of a couple of Germans?

10:47.950 --> 10:49.899
Got me a plan
that will make him sell.

10:50.065 --> 10:51.896
And what will you be wanting
in return for your help?

10:52.021 --> 10:54.279
Nothing.
I don't want nothing.

11:00.395 --> 11:02.472
'cept a cut of them profits.

11:02.597 --> 11:05.841
Piece of land free and
clear down by the river.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.442
Right. Look...

11:07.567 --> 11:09.446
You got yourself a
deal, Mr. Ferguson.

11:09.571 --> 11:10.962
Well done.
All right, then.

11:11.128 --> 11:12.171
Got us a deal.

11:12.337 --> 11:14.048
All right, then.

11:14.214 --> 11:16.688
Have us a lot of drinks.

11:16.813 --> 11:18.624
Psalms: Now, hazel, she was
a beautiful woman, hear me?

11:18.749 --> 11:20.159
She used to come over
from marshal's farm

11:20.284 --> 11:21.794
to help out with the sewing.

11:21.919 --> 11:24.517
Couldn't help but stare, you
know what I mean? [Laughs]

11:24.683 --> 11:27.568
She was so fine, I was
going to make her mine,

11:27.693 --> 11:29.022
one way or another.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.737
Shoot, I was a lady's
man back then, fellas.

11:31.862 --> 11:33.943
When there's ladies
around, you understand...

11:34.109 --> 11:36.821
Psalms, see you're feeling better.
Yeah.

11:36.987 --> 11:38.876
Good. Then shut up, keep
your eye on them hills.

11:39.001 --> 11:40.408
You're neglecting your work.

11:40.574 --> 11:41.791
I ain't neglected nothing.

11:41.916 --> 11:43.579
Work and talk at the same time.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.512
Apparently, you can't,
'cause you ain't doing it.

11:45.637 --> 11:47.513
So you keep your mouth shut and
do what you're paid to do.

11:47.638 --> 11:48.541
You understand me, son?

11:48.707 --> 11:50.182
I understand you real good.

11:50.307 --> 11:51.502
Mr. Bohannon.
Pardon me, sir.

11:51.668 --> 11:54.297
The darkies talking seems
to help them work.

11:54.463 --> 11:55.923
Mr. Toole, if I gave
a shit what you thought,

11:55.948 --> 11:58.926
I'd give you a bottle and ask.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.728
Enough noise, lads.

12:00.853 --> 12:02.331
We got a bridge to build.

[Whistle blows]

12:08.561 --> 12:09.729
Ahh. Good day.

12:13.232 --> 12:16.682
I see you let
the fox in the henhouse.

12:16.807 --> 12:18.279
Mr. Gunderson is helping me.

12:18.445 --> 12:19.530
Like hell he is.

12:19.696 --> 12:23.088
He was Thomas' bookkeeper for years.

12:23.213 --> 12:25.578
I need him here while Thomas is away.

12:25.819 --> 12:28.698
Mr. Bohannon,

12:28.823 --> 12:31.634
may I have your reports for review?

12:31.759 --> 12:33.294
He ain't talking to me, is he?

12:33.460 --> 12:38.103
I need to review your work. Please.

12:39.773 --> 12:42.428
This right here?
This ain't right.

12:47.848 --> 12:51.183
Ah. Is that a new rifle, Mr.
Bohannon?

12:56.621 --> 12:59.734
Matter of fact...
It is.

12:59.859 --> 13:02.962
Ahh.

13:03.448 --> 13:05.952
Took it off one of them dead
Sioux that raided the train.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.204
[Weapon clicks]

13:11.638 --> 13:13.334
Where do you think
he got it from, huh?

13:13.500 --> 13:14.986
I don't know.

13:15.111 --> 13:18.005
Perhaps you should have asked
him before you killed him.

13:18.171 --> 13:20.216
Really?

13:20.382 --> 13:22.051
Mmm.
Mr. Bohannon.

13:23.916 --> 13:27.223
Put down your rifle and leave.

13:34.855 --> 13:35.857
[Exhales]

13:36.023 --> 13:37.275
Good day.

13:40.676 --> 13:42.321
[Grunts]

13:54.047 --> 13:55.858
{pub}You look like you're thirsty.

13:56.126 --> 13:57.260
[Laughs]

13:57.385 --> 13:58.494
Maybe you need a drink tonight.

13:58.619 --> 14:00.693
Amen. Thirsty ain't a big enough word

14:00.818 --> 14:01.924
for what I'm going to be.

14:02.090 --> 14:04.332
How about a barrel?

14:04.457 --> 14:05.735
That big enough for you?

14:05.860 --> 14:07.535
Heh. What did you mean, barrel?

14:07.660 --> 14:09.307
Might be able to help you find one.

14:09.473 --> 14:11.503
Hmm.

14:11.628 --> 14:13.905
What kind of help we
talking about here?

14:14.030 --> 14:15.521
[Both chuckle]

14:15.687 --> 14:18.236
[Chains rattle and clank]

14:22.402 --> 14:24.113
Ahh.

14:30.689 --> 14:34.091
See, now, I'm thinking...

14:34.706 --> 14:37.532
It was the Sioux made you
cut that hair real close.

14:39.768 --> 14:41.172
Are you one of the tribe now?

14:41.338 --> 14:44.383
No, I cut my hair to
avoid those nasty lice,

14:44.549 --> 14:47.324
Mr. Bohannon.

14:47.449 --> 14:50.890
I do not fraternize with heathens.

14:54.192 --> 14:57.814
I know it was you
that armed the Indians.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.970
And you took a harmless
drunk, and you lit a fuse.

15:01.095 --> 15:03.738
It's you that's responsible
for that massacre out there,

15:03.863 --> 15:05.005
and you're going to confess to it.

15:05.030 --> 15:08.674
It was wonderful, wasn't it.

15:08.799 --> 15:12.181
Jah. Bloodthirsty heathens

15:12.306 --> 15:14.618
with modern weapons,

15:14.743 --> 15:20.989
led by a drunken white man of God.

15:21.114 --> 15:24.026
[Laughing]

15:24.151 --> 15:27.726
[Chuckles]

15:27.851 --> 15:29.896
Mr. Swede?
Yeah?

15:30.021 --> 15:31.597
You're out your damn mind.

15:31.763 --> 15:36.002
Death is like a balm
to men like you and me.

15:36.127 --> 15:38.437
We are very much alike, in that way.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.898
No. We ain't alike at all.

15:41.597 --> 15:44.039
[Grunts]

15:44.164 --> 15:47.642
You...
Try to tell yourself

15:47.767 --> 15:49.544
that you do not like the killing,

15:49.669 --> 15:51.367
but you just can't stop,

15:51.533 --> 15:56.550
because death is coming
for all of us.

15:56.675 --> 16:00.556
And in that intimate moment,

16:00.681 --> 16:06.086
when the person
who is dying is not me...

16:09.458 --> 16:12.388
It is invigorating.

16:12.554 --> 16:15.211
You must have felt something similar

16:15.336 --> 16:18.337
when you choked the life
out of Harper.

16:20.373 --> 16:23.858
You set me up on that account.
That's on you.

16:24.024 --> 16:27.551
No, no, no, no.

16:27.676 --> 16:32.888
Mr. Bohannon, Harper was a
terrified, innocent man.

16:33.013 --> 16:37.580
You must have felt some
doubt as to his guilt.

16:37.746 --> 16:41.360
But that doubt...
[Chuckles]

16:41.485 --> 16:43.663
It did not stop your fingers from

16:43.788 --> 16:47.590
wrapping 'round his throat.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.203
Of course, you also executed your...

He asked me to do that.

He asked you to put a gun to his
head and blow his brains out,

17:04.205 --> 17:06.085
and you agreed?

17:06.210 --> 17:08.277
But deep down, you must have felt

17:08.645 --> 17:12.290
that certain thrill, Jah?

17:12.415 --> 17:15.127
Enjoyed it, even.

17:15.252 --> 17:17.299
Right there, your desire to kill me,

17:17.424 --> 17:21.874
it brings a familiar...
Satisfaction, huh?

17:22.040 --> 17:24.767
Right?

17:45.722 --> 17:47.066
You're going to confess.

You don't need my confession.

18:00.203 --> 18:03.110

18:03.235 --> 18:07.336
You only need that to appease Mrs.

Mr. McGinnes!

18:20.974 --> 18:23.394
I thought you granted me
an extension on the rent.

18:23.560 --> 18:27.356
Oh. I wanted to surprise you.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.156
It's a land deed.

18:35.322 --> 18:38.007
Aye.

18:38.132 --> 18:40.844
I secured you a prime plot

18:40.969 --> 18:43.289

18:43.455 --> 18:46.347
Mr. McGinnes, the Church
can't afford to relocate.

18:46.472 --> 18:49.484
We won't be able to pay what's due.

18:49.609 --> 18:53.549
Ruth, you came to me
in my hour of need.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.427
I simply want to repay
your gesture of kindness.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.707
Did he confess?

19:17.832 --> 19:19.844
Not yet.

19:19.969 --> 19:22.606
And you've no other
evidence of the crime?

19:26.045 --> 19:28.458

19:28.583 --> 19:31.617
Then you'll have to set him free, Mr.
Bohannon.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.425
Can't do that.

19:36.591 --> 19:38.928

19:39.094 --> 19:42.501
I can't keep my promise
to pay the men on time

19:42.626 --> 19:45.303
if I can't decipher the accounts.

19:45.428 --> 19:48.938
I need Mr. Gunderson's help.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.731
He's a dangerous man.

19:50.897 --> 19:56.176
He's more valuable to me
than dangerous to you.

19:56.301 --> 19:59.181
We cannot keep him
on suspicion alone.

19:59.447 --> 20:01.909
Do you understand? You've
got to let him out.

cold rat meat was a delicacy.

you will understand that.

24:11.832 --> 24:15.674
is that I am a constant reminder

34:30.178 --> 34:32.022
and you come here
wanting to do business?

34:32.147 --> 34:33.989
You're mistaken, Carl.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.532
We're mates, sure.

34:35.697 --> 34:38.284
Ahh, don't insult the man's
intelligence, Sean.

34:38.552 --> 34:39.893
Let me do the talking, Mick.

34:40.018 --> 34:43.627
We had the darkies
smash up your whiskey barrels.

34:43.752 --> 34:45.829
And if you order another shipment,

34:45.954 --> 34:47.543
we'll have them smashed, too.

34:47.710 --> 34:50.534
And then, your bar,
and then, your tent,

34:50.659 --> 34:55.239
and then, I personally will
bust your bones to bits

34:55.364 --> 34:59.305
and feed your greasy carcass
to the pigs outside.

34:59.471 --> 35:01.814
If you come anywhere
near me or my place,

35:01.939 --> 35:03.841
I'll call Hahn and his crew.

35:03.966 --> 35:06.256
Hahn?
[Chuckles]

35:06.381 --> 35:08.955
Tell him to bring
his friend the butcher,

35:09.080 --> 35:10.525
if he can find him.

35:13.752 --> 35:15.447
I thought we were mates.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.907
We are.

35:18.073 --> 35:19.300
Carl, we are.

35:19.425 --> 35:21.337
We're mates.

35:21.462 --> 35:24.940
This is just business.

35:25.065 --> 35:26.499
Sell us the bar, Carl.

35:26.665 --> 35:29.571
We'll give you a good price.
