institution patient,

05:40.423 --> 05:43.017
William Henry Glazer,
formerly of Chatsworth.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.346
Glazer is wanted for

05:45.554 --> 05:47.477
the so-called canyon slayings,

05:47.681 --> 05:49.479

brutal knife slayings

05:49.683 --> 05:51.902

Canyon area residents...

05:52.102 --> 05:53.649

06:09.327 --> 06:12.251

06:12.455 --> 06:15.049

on their own as he is
thought to be armed

06:16.960 --> 06:19.679
and extremely dangerous.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.803

06:25.093 --> 06:27.516
was arrested by city police
today in Los Angeles.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.691
Is it getting worse
every day, or is it just me?

06:31.850 --> 06:33.648
I don't think it's just you.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.023
Do you need anything
from the store?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.447
You kidding?
It's after 11:00.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.728
Can't it wait till morning?

Well we need some
milk for breakfast

06:41.610 --> 06:43.362
and I'm out of cigarettes.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.570
I'll be right back.

06:44.613 --> 06:47.241
Come on Lise, there's a
nut out there somewhere.

06:47.449 --> 06:48.826
Why don't you just forget it?

06:49.034 --> 06:49.830
Forget about it.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.083
I'll be gone 10 minutes.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.756
He isn't out there attacking cars.
For goodness sakes.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.458
No, absolutely not.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.213
You are not going
out for cigarettes.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.135
Oh, come on.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.178
You're not going
out for cigarettes.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.778
- You're a slave to them.
- Phillip.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.307
I mean it Lise,
you're not going.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.385
This is driving me crazy.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.721
Well then give
the damn things up.

07:40.251 --> 07:43.175
Daddy, I can't sleep.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.428
Well, you little phony,
of course you can't sleep.

07:45.632 --> 07:46.428
You're kneeling on your pillow.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.226
Get under the covers, come on.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.894
That's a girl.
Now close your eyes.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.642
You can't sleep with them open.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.227
All right, I'm gonna
sit right here till

07:53.431 --> 07:54.431
you get to sleep.

07:54.516 --> 07:55.716
I don't want to see you blink.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.559
Get down, get down from there.

08:34.764 --> 08:35.764
Hey!

08:35.890 --> 08:37.857
Get away. Get Away.

08:38.058 --> 08:41.154
Get down, hey
come on down.

08:41.395 --> 08:44.149
Oh, oh I'm sorry
Lisa, I'm sorry.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.609
I shouldn't have him
off the leash like this

08:45.817 --> 08:47.819
but we were walking
around the neighborhood.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.948
You know, that nut is
loose in Topanga somewhere.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.080
Really?

08:51.281 --> 08:52.521
Yeah, it was just on the radio.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.255
A sheriff's deputy got
slashed all to hell

08:54.325 --> 08:55.325
down in Malibu.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.127
Wow.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.567
And the guy who did it ran up in

08:57.620 --> 08:59.213
the hills somewhere.

08:59.456 --> 09:00.924
You know you, you really
shouldn't have to go out

09:01.124 --> 09:02.797
tonight if you don't have to.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.674
Oh, I'm just going to the store.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.596
Yeah, well why
don't you send Phil?

09:06.963 --> 09:09.432
Well, I'd rather leave
him with the kids, thanks.

09:09.632 --> 09:10.758
Yeah, I can see your point.

09:10.967 --> 09:11.763
All right, but be careful, huh.

09:11.968 --> 09:12.968
Okay, night Norman.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.308
Goodnight.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.909
Lisa, you know if
I finish that drywall

09:28.109 --> 09:29.110
tomorrow we should
be able to get the

09:29.319 --> 09:30.616
guest bedroom painted by...

09:32.947 --> 09:34.199
Lisa.

09:39.454 --> 09:40.454
Lisa!

09:40.538 --> 09:42.381
The 33-year-old
highway patrolman

09:44.751 --> 09:46.271
with multiple knife
wounds to the upper

09:46.377 --> 09:47.503
chest and face.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.510
Hospital spokesman
say he is in surgery

09:49.714 --> 09:51.074
at this moment and
declined to list

09:51.174 --> 09:52.266
his condition.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.747
Phillip's assailant
may have been

09:53.927 --> 09:56.100
William Henry
Glazier, the escaped

09:56.304 --> 09:57.476
mental patient.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.102
He is wanted in connection
with the grizzly

09:59.307 --> 10:01.230
knife slayings of five
Los Angeles Canyon

10:01.434 --> 10:02.777
residents in recent weeks.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.570
Witnesses to the
assault say the man

10:04.771 --> 10:06.569
matching Glazier's
description was wearing

10:06.773 --> 10:08.571
grey institutional
type work clothes

10:08.775 --> 10:11.494
and escaped into the
Topanga Foothills.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.571
The same foothills where
sheriff's department

10:13.780 --> 10:15.657
officials are now
conducting an intense

10:15.865 --> 10:17.367
foot and helicopter search.

10:17.575 --> 10:18.576
KF...

10:38.972 --> 10:40.645
All right, I sure need a ride.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.192
Hey wait, wait!

10:45.436 --> 10:47.313

Metropolitans please.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.492
Metropolitans.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.322
Regulars or longs?

11:37.530 --> 11:38.782
Regular.

11:41.618 --> 11:42.790
Did you hear about
that highway patrolman

11:42.994 --> 11:43.745
getting stabbed up here?

11:43.953 --> 11:45.000
Yeah, terrible.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.550
Yeah, just down the road.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.468
Should have seen
those cop cars boy.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.638
I'll tell you, those
guys come down real fast

11:53.838 --> 11:54.680
when it's one of their own.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.758
Well, I don't envy
you having to work here

11:56.966 --> 11:58.388
alone all night.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.314
I'm not alone.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.861
Yeah, well, I don't like guns.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.403
He was in the
backseat with a knife.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.360
He's the guy they were
talking about on the radio.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.071
It's okay.

17:51.279 --> 17:52.531
It's over.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.494
Lets just call the cops, huh?

didn't want to drive.

18:53.174 --> 18:55.142
Are you mad at me?

19:02.058 --> 19:04.060

Master of all I survey.

43:19.347 --> 43:21.349
Stay away from me!

43:24.977 --> 43:27.071
Stay away from me!

43:40.034 --> 43:41.786
Well, he's not there either.

43:42.245 --> 43:44.247
Zock, can you think
of any place else?

43:44.789 --> 43:47.212
The Game-O-Rama should be open
in a couple of minutes.

43:47.542 --> 43:48.942
We could check there
if you want to.

43:49.043 --> 43:50.135
I doubt he'd go there
if he was running

43:50.336 --> 43:51.087
away, though-

43:51.295 --> 43:52.217
- Lets go.
- Come on, gel: in the car.

43:52.421 --> 43:53.421
Get in.

43:53.464 --> 43:54.841
Let's get the key in the door.

43:55.049 --> 43:57.017
All right, all
right, I'm opening it.

43:57.593 --> 43:59.220
Oh, it's still closed.

43:59.846 --> 44:01.519
Hey Willie, seen J.J.?

44:01.722 --> 44:02.723
No, not since last night, kid.

44:02.932 --> 44:04.149
All right, I'll open it up.

44:04.350 --> 44:06.523
It's like you guys have
never played before.

44:07.395 --> 44:08.521
Where the hell could he be?

44:08.729 --> 44:10.106
We got to call
the police, Jerry.

44:10.314 --> 44:11.065
Lets go.

44:11.941 --> 44:13.488
What the hell is this?

44:28.583 --> 44:31.427
Look what they
did to the machines.

44:32.378 --> 44:34.096
Damn vandals.

44:34.380 --> 44:37.133
I am The Bishop of Battle.

44:37.592 --> 44:40.892
Master of all I survey.

44:41.095 --> 44:42.142
J.J.

44:42.346 --> 44:45.941
I have 13 progressively
harder levels.

44:46.517 --> 44:47.517
He's got you.

44:47.643 --> 44:49.987
Try me if you dare.

44:50.188 --> 44:52.190
Insert coin.

44:52.857 --> 44:55.610
I am The Bishop of Battle.

44:55.818 --> 44:59.243
Master of all I survey.

45:00.031 --> 45:04.662
I have 13 progressively
harder levels.

45:05.953 --> 45:08.047
Try me if you dare.

46:32.665 --> 46:33.962
Frank.

46:34.583 --> 46:36.051
Frank.

46:36.919 --> 46:38.592
Are you all right?

46:38.838 --> 46:40.715
Are you all right?

46:41.424 --> 46:42.676
A nightmare.

46:43.467 --> 46:44.764
What was it about?

46:44.969 --> 46:46.016
It was horrible.

46:49.890 --> 46:51.892
I'm sorry, sorry.

46:57.481 --> 47:00.200
It's all getting too extreme.

47:01.235 --> 47:03.329
I think maybe I should visit
my local parish priest.

47:05.740 --> 47:07.834
It's almost 9:00, Frank.

47:30.306 --> 47:32.684
Blessed art thou among women,

47:33.142 --> 47:35.190
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

47:35.394 --> 47:37.192
Holy Mary, mother of God,

47:37.396 --> 47:39.398
pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour...

48:44.797 --> 48:47.892
You are asking,
Father, why we are

48:48.092 --> 48:49.890
given so many signs of evil

48:50.094 --> 48:52.688
and so few signs of good.

48:54.014 --> 48:55.494
I can't help but
think that the entire

48:55.683 --> 48:58.277
concept of good and evil
may be a fallacious one,

48:58.477 --> 48:59.069
Your Eminence.

48:59.270 --> 49:00.487
It's come to that.

49:10.448 --> 49:12.450
God works in ways we
cannot understand.

49:12.658 --> 49:13.409
is with him now.

49:13.617 --> 49:16.871
He's in a better place.

50:43.582 --> 50:45.801
You've been a good friend, Luis.

50:48.629 --> 50:49.630
You're leaving?

50:49.838 --> 50:51.260
Uh huh.

50:52.508 --> 50:54.055
Where you going?

50:55.636 --> 50:58.139
Well, I got about $78 in cash

50:58.347 --> 50:59.644
and a credit card
with about $100

50:59.848 --> 51:01.191
still left on it.

51:01.809 --> 51:03.857
I'm gonna drive until
I can't buy gas anymore

51:04.061 --> 51:07.611
and then I'm gonna stop,
get some kind of a job.

51:07.815 --> 51:09.692
What are you, crazy?

51:10.025 --> 51:13.404
Come on, Frank, everybody
has a crisis of faith.

51:13.612 --> 51:16.161
You do, I do, the Bishop does.

51:16.532 --> 51:18.626
Even St. Thomas did.

51:18.826 --> 51:20.453
But it doesn't mean you stop,

51:20.661 --> 51:22.038
pick up everything and go.

51:22.246 --> 51:25.125
I respect your belief, Luis.

51:25.416 --> 51:28.135
Respect my lack of belief.

51:34.592 --> 51:35.844
ls all this happening
because of that

51:36.051 --> 51:37.177
little boy's death?

51:37.469 --> 51:39.517
You're really not giving
me much credit, are you?

51:41.348 --> 51:43.225
What about the
family, my friend?

51:43.434 --> 51:44.526
You're gonna leave
them with that

51:44.727 --> 51:46.729
pitiful excuse for a
eulogy and then just go?

51:48.105 --> 51:49.152
Think.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.363
Think about what that
says to them, Frank.

51:53.444 --> 51:55.196
Frank, you've been
their shepherd.

51:55.404 --> 51:56.280
The least you can
do is wait until

51:56.488 --> 51:58.331
their grief begins to dissipate.

51:59.617 --> 52:03.167
Look, I don't care what
you really believe in.

52:03.370 --> 52:04.838
All I know is those
people are in desperate

52:05.039 --> 52:06.712
need of counseling.

52:07.583 --> 52:10.132
You've become very
important to them.

52:10.836 --> 52:12.679
They need you, Frank.

52:14.048 --> 52:15.595
The well is dry.

52:21.930 --> 52:23.352
What are you doing?

52:23.557 --> 52:25.059
Frank, it's holy
water, it's blessed.

52:25.309 --> 52:28.813
It's tap water and I need it.

52:29.355 --> 52:30.982
I got a long drive
across the desert

52:31.190 --> 52:33.067
and a car with no
air conditioning.

52:35.110 --> 52:36.532
Adios, Luis.

52:40.157 --> 52:41.534
Thank you.

54:33.520 --> 54:34.863
Grocery store.

54:35.063 --> 54:35.609
Hold up.

54:35.814 --> 54:36.814
What?

54:36.899 --> 54:38.659
They shot the kid.
They want the last rights.

54:38.859 --> 54:39.859
Get an ambulance.

54:39.985 --> 54:40.781
He's gone, Frank.

54:40.986 --> 54:41.782
Get an ambulance.

54:41.987 --> 54:42.704
<i>He's gone.</i>

54:42.905 --> 54:44.248
Get an ambulance.

54:47.367 --> 54:49.665
Sit down, it's gonna
be all right, sit down.

56:05.696 --> 56:06.868
I see only anarchy.

56:07.072 --> 56:10.076
I see inexplicable,
unfathomable anarchy.

56:10.284 --> 56:12.036
And I see people
ground up in the gears

56:12.244 --> 56:13.496
of this anarchy.

56:13.704 --> 56:15.547
I see people in anguish.

56:19.293 --> 56:22.718
My biggest fear
is this is not the

56:22.921 --> 56:24.298
work of the devil
because there can

56:24.506 --> 56:27.635
be no devil if there is no God.

56:27.843 --> 56:29.436
And if there were
an Almighty God,

56:30.304 --> 56:32.727
he would never allow
such suffering.

56:33.891 --> 56:35.768
I've come to believe
that we are living

56:35.976 --> 56:38.650
in a great void, Your Eminence.

56:39.521 --> 56:41.068
I've lost my faith.

58:08.193 --> 58:10.070
What is it you want?

58:11.905 --> 58:13.578
What is it you want?

01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:40.099
No!

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:47.269
No!

01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:22.469
There's no tracks
in that sand anywhere.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.723
There's no strange
paint in those dents

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:27.349
on your car.

01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:29.348
Nah, there's just no evidence of

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:31.354
another vehicle
around here anywhere.

01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:36.479
You think I'm making this up?

01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:40.534
No sir, uh, I think
that maybe you fell

01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:42.862
asleep and went off the road.

01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:45.913
Your car rolled over
and you got thrown out.

01:03:46.114 --> 01:03:48.116
They say you got
a mild concussion.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.828
I had one of them once myself.

01:03:51.036 --> 01:03:53.164
Gave me the weirdest
dreams, like you.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:58.883
You know, Father, in
the history of the church

01:03:59.044 --> 01:04:02.423
only a few, very few
individuals have been

01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:06.601
given a literal
sign, as at Lourdes.

01:04:06.801 --> 01:04:08.269
That's why the word is faith.

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:09.470
You understand?

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.807
: Well, we're right
smack dab between

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:14.393
that hospital up in
Bisbee and Travis General

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:16.069
where you're coming from.

01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:19.698
I'll have that driver just
take you on up to Bisbee.

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:21.866
No wait, wait...

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:27.489
Take me to Travis.

01:04:28.782 --> 01:04:30.125
Now you did tell me
you were leaving there,

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:31.577
didn't ya?

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:35.331
That's where my parish is.

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:39.459
Yes sir, it's all right with me.

01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:46.759
Travis.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:14.288
Steven?

01:07:14.489 --> 01:07:15.490
Huh?

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:17.282
Steven?

01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:18.325
What?

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:20.127
I heard it again.

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:23.506
Can rats get in
between the walls?

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:25.208
It's not rats.

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:27.259
It's the wind.

01:07:28.336 --> 01:07:30.338
The branches need a trimming.

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:31.799
Go to sleep.

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:51.822
Just turn off the
violins, will ya, Bill?

01:07:52.026 --> 01:07:53.152
This isn't the first
time this son of a...

01:07:53.361 --> 01:07:55.489
the nitwit screwed up.

01:07:57.865 --> 01:07:59.663
So his wife's expecting.

01:07:59.867 --> 01:08:00.867
It isn't the issue.

01:08:00.994 --> 01:08:02.621
The man's an employee,
he works for us.

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:03.876
He represents us.

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:05.540
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let him embarrass us again.

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:06.416
Mommy.

01:08:06.624 --> 01:08:07.744
We're on the line here, too.

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:12.681
What's pryidoxine hydrochloride?

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.006
God knows.

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:15.262
No notice...

01:08:15.466 --> 01:08:16.466
- Am I eating it?
- Just give him two weeks severance

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:17.768
and get him out.

01:08:17.969 --> 01:08:19.220
Look Bill, I'll be in
in a half an hour.

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:20.555
I want Higgins gone.

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:22.848
Jim Higgins.

01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:24.393
You don't know
anything about this, Claire,

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.600
so don't start.

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.274
Jim used to be
your best salesman.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.357
You know, Nancy's pregnant.

01:08:30.648 --> 01:08:32.491
What's this with
the exterminator?

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:34.702
What's all this about?

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:36.448
We have rats.

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:38.658
I heard them in the walls
and later in the attic.

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:39.618
You didn't wake up.

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:40.916
Are they white ones?

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:42.790
Just go out and
buy a couple of traps.

01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:44.996
I'll set them up tonight
and that'll be it.

01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:46.501
Well, I just
figured you wouldn't

01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:48.252
want to be bothered
with setting traps.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:50.218
Look, we still want
the swimming pool, right?

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.292
What?

01:08:51.336 --> 01:08:53.212
The swimming pool,
I take it we still want to put it in.

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:56.095
Oh yeah, Daddy, of course we do.

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:58.142
Well, we're going to, peanut.

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:01.011
But the way we're going
to is by not wasting

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.723
a lot of money on things
like cleaning ladies

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:07.060
twice a week and
shyster rat catchers

01:09:07.268 --> 01:09:09.987
who come out and look for
droppings once a month.

01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:12.524
We did agree that certain things

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:13.654
we're going to start
doing around here

01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:15.826
all by ourselves,
didn't we, Claire?

01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:18.121
If you catch the rat
can I keep it, Daddy?

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:19.823
I'll tell you what, sweetheart,

01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:22.658
if Mommy says it's okay,
you've got yourself a deal.

01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:24.618
Here you go.
Go get your books.

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:25.749
I'll wait for you in the car.

01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:27.375
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:03.517
Oh no, honey.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:06.513
You see anything?

01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:07.893
Insulation.

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:13.027
Mr. Thompson has
two rats in a cage.

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:14.904
Who's Mr. Thompson?

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.822
Billy Noble's teacher.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.569
One's named Annie, the
other, he's the boy,

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:22.905
he's named Pinto
because he has these

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:24.534
little pink spots all over.

01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:25.739
Oh.

01:11:41.172 --> 01:11:43.550
Billy says Pinto is this big.

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:45.427
Brooke, please.

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:50.188
Did you do it?

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:52.107
Yeah, tough job.

01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:54.231
Took all of a minute and a half.

01:12:29.303 --> 01:12:30.805
What's the trouble here?

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.017
No trouble.

01:12:35.643 --> 01:12:36.860
Seems like we've had this kind

01:12:37.061 --> 01:12:39.029
of trouble around
here for a month.

01:12:40.731 --> 01:12:42.324
How would you know?

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:43.868
You're never around.

01:12:45.236 --> 01:12:47.955
You're either traveling
or at the office or something.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.452
I'm here now.

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:54.454
Steven.

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:56.831
Steven.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:02.386
Steven, you're not even here
when you're here anymore.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.593
Do you know how
insensitive you've become?

01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:12.977
You use a sledgehammer
most of the time

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:15.023
when just a word
or two would do.

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:17.352
There are people
who get things clone

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.858
and there are people
who don't, Claire.

01:13:20.646 --> 01:13:22.319
Steven.

01:13:33.701 --> 01:13:36.671
All our problems should
be solved so easily.

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:38.922
Steven, would you
please get rid of it?

01:13:39.123 --> 01:13:40.249
What?

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:42.711
Would you please get rid of it?

01:13:43.294 --> 01:13:44.294
Now?

01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:45.634
Well, I am not going
to be able to sleep

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:46.714
knowing it's bleeding all over us.

01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:48.049
I am not getting dressed
and going down -

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:50.100
- Steven please, please.
- Absolutely.

01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:52.645
Yes m♪am, at your service.

01:13:54.889 --> 01:13:58.564
Your hero humbly accepts
his thanks, by the way.

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:20.683
I can't find Rosie.

01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:22.017
What'd you say, hun?

01:15:22.226 --> 01:15:23.603
Rosie, she's gone.

01:15:23.894 --> 01:15:25.174
You mean she wasn't in your room

01:15:25.312 --> 01:15:26.108
when you woke up?

01:15:26.313 --> 01:15:27.986
No and I'm scared.

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:30.284
Oh honey, she probably
just went out somewhere.

01:15:30.484 --> 01:15:32.282
She never just goes away.

01:15:32.486 --> 01:15:33.954
Sometimes she does.

01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:35.859
Somebody got a problem here?

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:37.249
Rosie's gone.

01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:39.578
Mama says she just
goes away some times.

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:41.503
But she doesn't.

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:43.706
Oh, this sink is all plugged up.

01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:46.175
I'm afraid something's
happened to her.

01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:48.427
Here let me do that, hun.

01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:49.378
Excuse me.

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:51.555
Wasn't Rosie fixed?

01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:53.196
Yeah, she was fixed
almost a year ago

01:15:53.257 --> 01:15:55.680
but that doesn't mean
that she can't go out sometimes.

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:58.229
She wouldn't go out for that.

01:15:58.429 --> 01:15:59.646
I know her.

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:02.441
Rosie wouldn't go
out for that at all.

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:04.609
Don't worry about Rosie, peanut.

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:06.858
She'll be back by the time
you get home from school.

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:09.282
We better hurry up,
we're gonna be late.

01:16:15.613 --> 01:16:18.662
Oh, that's disgusting.

01:16:19.366 --> 01:16:20.618
What is it?

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:23.374
Nothing to worry about.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.502
Just some old rat hair.

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:29.051
I thought you said
it was a white rat.

01:16:30.753 --> 01:16:32.721
I'm surprised that
little guy wasn't bald.

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:40.138
Rosie.

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:42.647
Kitty.

01:16:44.058 --> 01:16:45.435
Rosie.

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:50.030
Kitty, kitty.

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:54.736
Rosie, come here.

01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:03.957
Rosie.

01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:06.376
Kitty.

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:11.259
Here, kitty kitty.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.803
Rosie.

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:15.469
Rosie?

01:17:18.134 --> 01:17:19.681
Rosie.

01:17:20.719 --> 01:17:21.971
Oh...

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:24.890
Rosie?

01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:29.858
Kitty?

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:31.529
Rosie?

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:32.856
Oh great.

01:17:34.817 --> 01:17:35.818
Rosie.

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:37.949
Hi Rosie, come here.

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:39.576
Rosie?

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.253
Come here, kitty.

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:49.210
Ow.

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:52.172
Come here, Rosie, come on.

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:55.383
Won't you come here?

01:17:55.588 --> 01:17:56.805
Rosie?

01:17:59.049 --> 01:18:00.642
You all right, honey?

01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:03.604
Come here kitty, come here.

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:05.147
What's the matter?

01:18:09.143 --> 01:18:10.190
Rosie?

01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:11.862
You all right?

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:16.442
Baby, I'm gonna catch you.

01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:18.276
Oh.

01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:30.498
Come on, Rosie.

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:38.673
Oh, oh.

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:19.255
Okay, bye.

01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:21.599
Hi honey.
You have a good day?

01:19:21.799 --> 01:19:22.799
Pretty good.

01:19:22.967 --> 01:19:24.640
Billy was lying about Pinto.

01:19:24.843 --> 01:19:27.813
He's only that big.

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:30.273
Did Rosie come home yet?

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:33.315
Did she?

01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:35.362
No, she didn't, honey.

01:19:35.562 --> 01:19:37.690
Can I go to Cindy's
after I change?

01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:38.899
Sure ya can.

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:40.485
You have to be home
before it gets dark. All right?

01:19:40.693 --> 01:19:41.410
Okay.

01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:47.533
Mommy!

01:19:47.866 --> 01:19:49.209
Look what Rosie did!

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:52.334
Honey, wait for me.

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:56.129
What is it, honey?

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:58.093
Look.

01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:01.263
Why would Rosie do that?

01:20:02.923 --> 01:20:04.641
What's wrong, Mommy?

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:10.972
Oh.

01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:12.808
Oh my god.

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:29.492
Why would Rosie do this, Mommy?

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:32.161
I don't know, honey.

01:20:38.459 --> 01:20:40.461
Choosey's okay.

01:20:49.553 --> 01:20:51.681
Honey, why don't we go over...

01:20:57.644 --> 01:20:58.395
Mommy.

01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:00.072
It's all right honey.
It's all right.

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:02.400
Why don't we, uh, go
over to Cindy's now.

01:21:02.608 --> 01:21:03.609
Okay?

01:21:10.824 --> 01:21:12.872
The wires have
been gnawed through.

01:21:13.077 --> 01:21:14.704
That's what caused
the flickering light.

01:21:14.912 --> 01:21:18.007
But aren't wires
inside pipes or something?

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:21.047
Look at this.

01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:22.920
Didn't seem to
bother this fella.

01:21:23.128 --> 01:21:25.802
You mean it bit
straight through the pipe?

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:27.762
A rat can do that?

01:21:27.966 --> 01:21:30.810
I've seen a seven
pound rat squeeze through

01:21:31.011 --> 01:21:32.729
a quarter inch
crack under a door

01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:34.603
without exhaling, Mrs. Houston.

01:21:34.807 --> 01:21:36.559
I've seen them living
in mud huts along

01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:39.691
the river like beavers
and nesting in trees

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:41.192
like eagles.

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:44.492
I've seen 'em as big as
a medium size dog

01:21:44.691 --> 01:21:47.035
and as small as a big June bug.

01:21:47.486 --> 01:21:51.616
I'm no longer surprised at
anything I see a rat do.

01:21:51.824 --> 01:21:53.576
Very special animals.

01:21:54.618 --> 01:21:57.918
They're horrid
animals is what they are.

01:21:58.122 --> 01:21:59.499
This one is big and horrid.

01:21:59.706 --> 01:22:01.208
You saw him?

01:22:01.708 --> 01:22:03.927
Well, I saw his eyes.

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:06.589
He was, uh, looking at me when I

01:22:06.797 --> 01:22:08.344
was underneath the house.

01:22:08.549 --> 01:22:10.142
How long have
you been on vacation

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:11.342
or wherever?

01:22:11.885 --> 01:22:13.762
Oh, we haven't been anywhere.

01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:15.769
But your little
girl has been away?

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:18.441
No, Why?

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:21.566
Well it's obvious your
pest has been working

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:22.817
at this for several weeks.

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:25.612
How come you didn't
notice until today?

01:22:26.733 --> 01:22:30.112
Well, that wall was
perfect yesterday.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.624
That happened sometime
during the night.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:38.849
I think you better
show me the cabinet

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:40.672
he was into downstairs.

01:23:00.434 --> 01:23:02.152
oh, my god.

01:23:02.728 --> 01:23:06.028
That, madam, was not done
by your average rodent.

01:23:08.066 --> 01:23:10.114
I've never seen that
kind of destruction.

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:13.698
Steven, look what
this thing has done.

01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:16.034
It's worse than we thought.

01:23:17.242 --> 01:23:18.744
My name is
Keefer, Mr. Houston.

01:23:19.119 --> 01:23:20.999
You've got an unusually
aggressive visitor, sir.

01:23:21.079 --> 01:23:23.332
- I've never seen anything like...
- You know that it's killed Rosie

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:24.336
and I found her under the house.

01:23:24.541 --> 01:23:26.009
Apparently, my
wife misunderstood me.

01:23:26.210 --> 01:23:27.587
I was under the impression
that we agreed I was

01:23:27.794 --> 01:23:29.341
gonna handle this
problem by myself.

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:31.186
Steven you can't
handle this problem by...

01:23:31.256 --> 01:23:33.759
How much do I
owe you Mr. Keefer?

01:23:33.967 --> 01:23:35.435
Well sir, you really
don't owe me anything.

01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:36.933
- Well then, thank you very much.
- Steven.

01:23:37.137 --> 01:23:38.354
I apologize for having
wasted your time.

01:23:38.555 --> 01:23:39.807
Steven.

01:23:40.349 --> 01:23:41.521
Wait a minute.

01:23:41.725 --> 01:23:43.272
Look, I'm not gonna
let Brooke sleep up in her room.

01:23:43.477 --> 01:23:44.569
Wait till you see the
damage it's done.

01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:46.147
Then she can sleep in the
bedroom next to our room.

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:48.653
Would you excuse us
please, Mr. Keefer.

01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:05.708
I'm terribly sorry I
bruised your precious ego.

01:24:05.916 --> 01:24:07.636
Get off my back, Claire.
I had a tough clay.

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:08.505
I had no idea it was so fragile.

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:09.802
We have a second rat,
I'll get rid of it.

01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:11.220
You know what
Mr. Keefer said?

01:24:11.421 --> 01:24:12.343
- He said he's never...
- You know what your problem is?

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:13.390
Seen this kind of destruction.

01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:15.217
It's the same as 99% of
the people in this world.

01:24:15.425 --> 01:24:16.176
Why don't we bring
in somebody who's

01:24:16.385 --> 01:24:17.386
see this type of damage.

01:24:17.594 --> 01:24:20.188
It never occurs to you
to do something yourself.

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:26.607
Will Rosie come back?

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.948
Well, you know what I think?

01:24:30.148 --> 01:24:31.445
I think Rosie might
have gone to visit

01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:32.446
some friends.

01:24:32.651 --> 01:24:34.619
But will she ever come back?

01:24:36.488 --> 01:24:37.660
I don't know.

01:24:37.864 --> 01:24:39.787
We'll just have to wait and see.

01:24:40.659 --> 01:24:42.036
Now you get some sleep now.

01:24:42.244 --> 01:24:43.444
Tomorrow's another school day.

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:45.872
Good night.

01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:48.299
Don't close the door.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.592
I won't.

01:24:49.793 --> 01:24:50.919
Good night.

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:00.395
Good night, Rosie.

01:25:06.643 --> 01:25:08.987
I think we should
buy Brooke another cat.

01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:10.689
A kitten.

01:25:10.897 --> 01:25:12.524
It probably would be best
to wait until we get rid of...

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.280
Hello?

01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:21.246
Mrs. Houston, it's Keefer.

01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:22.201
Yes.

01:25:22.409 --> 01:25:24.457
The reason I'm calling
is, well, this might sound

01:25:24.661 --> 01:25:26.861
a little strange Mrs. Houston,
but there's this old book

01:25:26.913 --> 01:25:30.713
I have from back in
Germany in the 1600s.

01:25:30.917 --> 01:25:34.091
Tells about a thing called
the das Teufel Nagetier.

01:25:34.296 --> 01:25:35.548
Das what?

01:25:35.756 --> 01:25:37.383
Claire, who is it?

01:25:37.591 --> 01:25:39.434
Das Teufel Nagetier.

01:25:39.843 --> 01:25:42.392
I was going to tell
you about it today

01:25:42.596 --> 01:25:44.598
but Mr. Houston didn't seem much
in the mood for listening.

01:25:44.931 --> 01:25:46.478
Who is that?
It's late.

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:51.902
Well, what is this Das
Teufel, whatever it is?

01:25:52.105 --> 01:25:54.858
It translates into
“the devil rodent".

01:25:55.359 --> 01:25:57.487
It's a legend about
huge malevolent rodents

01:25:57.694 --> 01:25:59.321
with unbelievable
cunning and strength

01:25:59.529 --> 01:26:02.499
that terrorize certain
villainous individuals

01:26:02.699 --> 01:26:03.699
in 17th Century Europe.

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:05.543
Claire, who are you talking to?

01:26:05.744 --> 01:26:07.917
The problem is
according to the legend

01:26:08.205 --> 01:26:12.426
Das Teufel Nagetier cannot
be destroyed, Mrs. Houston.

01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:14.128
That's ridiculous.

01:26:14.336 --> 01:26:15.883
Claire, who the hell is...

01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:17.755
Who is this?

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:19.258
It's Keefer, Mr. Houston.

01:26:19.633 --> 01:26:20.930
The reason I called
before is that I think

01:26:21.134 --> 01:26:23.262
the problem over there may
be bigger than you realize.

01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:25.313
What in hell are
you talking about?

01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:27.016
We have rats.

01:26:27.307 --> 01:26:28.433
I'll take care of them.

01:26:28.642 --> 01:26:29.642
You won't.

01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:31.687
Don't call again.

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:46.160
Everybody's got
their hand out Claire

01:26:46.368 --> 01:26:48.962
and you're always
right there to fill it.

01:26:51.415 --> 01:26:52.792
He told me an awful story.

01:26:52.999 --> 01:26:54.717
Of course he did,
to scare you into

01:26:54.918 --> 01:26:56.636
rehiring him.

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:02.013
Steven?

01:27:20.694 --> 01:27:22.196
Steven.

01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:25.032
Mommy, Daddy, I'm scared.

01:27:27.576 --> 01:27:28.623
Brooke.

01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:29.578
Mommy!

01:27:29.786 --> 01:27:31.163
Brooke!

01:27:36.001 --> 01:27:37.719
Brooke.

01:27:38.962 --> 01:27:41.010
Are you all right, sweetheart?

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:45.765
Honey, honey, oh God.

01:27:47.053 --> 01:27:48.053
Are you okay?

01:27:55.437 --> 01:27:56.529
What is going on?

01:27:56.730 --> 01:27:58.152
Oh God!

01:27:58.356 --> 01:27:59.356
Mommy.

01:28:00.025 --> 01:28:01.823
What is happening here?

01:28:04.446 --> 01:28:05.789
Steven?

01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:07.206
Come on, honey.

01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:49.115
Steven?

01:28:49.366 --> 01:28:50.709
Mommy!

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:52.549
It's all right honey,
you just stay right,

01:28:52.577 --> 01:28:53.669
I'm just gonna close the,

01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:55.338
I'm just gonna close the door.

01:28:55.539 --> 01:28:56.540
Okay?

01:28:56.748 --> 01:28:57.795
See?

01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:06.641
There.

01:29:06.842 --> 01:29:07.842
Okay?

01:29:08.426 --> 01:29:10.303
Mommy!

01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:13.436
Oh honey, it's
all right, sweetheart.

01:29:13.974 --> 01:29:15.851
They'll go back on.

01:29:16.059 --> 01:29:17.561
They will, I know.

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:47.140
Rosie, see, see,
they went back on.

01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:49.100
Now we'll just stay
right here and everything

01:29:49.259 --> 01:29:50.010
will be just fine.

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:51.218
All right?

01:30:44.773 --> 01:30:46.571
Steven!

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.328
Steven!

01:30:56.493 --> 01:30:58.086
Steven!

01:30:58.286 --> 01:30:59.663
Steven!

01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:01.373
What are you doing?

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:06.344
Steven, Steven,
you can't kill it.

01:31:06.544 --> 01:31:08.296
What are you talking about?

01:31:08.505 --> 01:31:09.597
Mommy, Daddy!

01:31:09.798 --> 01:31:11.471
He's in the ceiling!

01:31:15.553 --> 01:31:18.727
Honey, it's all right baby.

01:31:24.396 --> 01:31:27.149
Here, stay here.

01:31:29.109 --> 01:31:30.201
Steven!

01:31:30.402 --> 01:31:31.870
You can't kill it!

01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:34.038
You can't kill it!

01:31:38.118 --> 01:31:39.495
Steven!

01:31:48.253 --> 01:31:50.881
Steven!
You're gonna kill us!

01:31:52.298 --> 01:31:53.550
Steven!

01:31:53.758 --> 01:31:54.758
Steven!

01:31:54.884 --> 01:31:55.884
You're gonna kill...

01:32:01.307 --> 01:32:02.684
Mommy!

01:32:04.019 --> 01:32:05.111
Brooke, open the door!

01:32:05.311 --> 01:32:06.528
What?

01:32:07.772 --> 01:32:11.072
Come on baby,
honey, open the door.

01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:14.408
It's Daddy, open the door!

01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:17.990
Brooke, open the door.

01:32:18.158 --> 01:32:18.784
Watch out.

01:32:18.992 --> 01:32:19.663
No!

01:32:19.868 --> 01:32:21.040
You'll kill her.

01:32:21.244 --> 01:32:22.245
Watch out!

01:32:25.749 --> 01:32:27.046
Mommy!

01:32:36.342 --> 01:32:38.436
Help me!

01:32:38.636 --> 01:32:39.636
Steven!

01:32:39.804 --> 01:32:41.522
Mommy!

01:32:47.937 --> 01:32:49.610
Mommy!

01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:51.908
Mommy!

01:32:57.113 --> 01:32:58.740
Mommy!

01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:06.164
No, wait, you're
going to kill her.

01:33:12.378 --> 01:33:15.177
I think it's trying
to tell me something.

01:33:15.381 --> 01:33:16.598
What honey?

01:33:17.634 --> 01:33:20.604
What, what's the
rat gonna tell you?

01:33:21.096 --> 01:33:22.848
Bring baby...

01:33:23.056 --> 01:33:24.273
Bring baby.

01:33:24.474 --> 01:33:25.726
Hers.

01:33:25.934 --> 01:33:27.607
Bring her baby back to her.

01:33:27.811 --> 01:33:28.811
Oh.

01:33:34.943 --> 01:33:37.992
Mommy, Mommy!

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:40.744
Bring it back to her.

01:35:02.447 --> 01:35:04.575
No Daddy, please.

01:35:04.866 --> 01:35:08.040
Please Daddy, she
just wanted her baby.

01:35:10.914 --> 01:35:12.541
Please, Daddy.

01:36:02.715 --> 01:36:05.059
Mommy, Daddy.

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:17.781
Daddy, where do you
suppose she's going next?
