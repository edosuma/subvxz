01:50.110 --> 01:51.542

                      Aw...

Oh, good!                       

01:54.447 --> 01:57.582

all the candles.                

01:57.584 --> 02:00.251

is going to come true.

                look at this!   

02:08.428 --> 02:10.995
         All right, Edith, when 
         you can pry them apart,

02:10.997 --> 02:12.463
            I'll take my cake   
            over there.         

02:13.599 --> 02:14.599
            Gloria, it's time   

02:14.601 --> 02:17.001
                for the bride   
                to cut the cake.

02:17.003 --> 02:19.838
        Oh, thanks, Ma,         
  but I'm not a bride anymore.  

02:19.840 --> 02:21.773
  I'm an old married lady now.  

02:21.775 --> 02:23.407
          Yeah, well,           
    living with the meathead    

02:23.409 --> 02:26.811
     has put a lot of years     
         on all of us.          

02:26.813 --> 02:28.246
                 Oh, no, Archie.

02:28.248 --> 02:30.982
        I was looking through   
        the wedding pictures    

02:30.984 --> 02:34.452
and you look better now         
than you did then.              

02:34.454 --> 02:37.388
          Well, I was in a state
          of shock then.        

02:37.390 --> 02:38.389
Here, I brought you             

02:38.391 --> 02:40.458
a piece with                    
a rose on it.                   

02:40.460 --> 02:41.893
            All right, Edith,   
            leave it there.     

02:41.895 --> 02:44.028
You want your cake              
over there too, Ma?             

02:44.030 --> 02:45.764
Oh, no. Later, Gloria.          

02:45.766 --> 02:49.234
I don't want to get             
this album sticky.              

02:49.236 --> 02:53.638
Oh, my, look                    
at this picture.                

02:53.640 --> 02:56.040
Ain't that wonderful?           

02:56.042 --> 02:59.477
Look, Archie, a picture         
of our living room.             

02:59.479 --> 03:03.314
         Gee, Edith, now we know
         what it looks like.    

03:03.316 --> 03:07.351
But, Archie, it ain't           
our living room now.            

03:07.353 --> 03:10.021
It's our                        
living room then.               

03:10.023 --> 03:12.023
                 Yeah, the magic
                 of photography.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.758
                  How thrilling.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.027
Daddy, it's a                   
lovely picture.                 

03:16.029 --> 03:17.095
            I mean--            

03:17.097 --> 03:19.097
    look at all the             
    beautiful flowers and things

03:19.099 --> 03:20.832
            that were brought in
            for the wedding.    

03:20.834 --> 03:22.633
     All I can think of is      
     the unbeautiful thing      

03:22.635 --> 03:23.835
 that stayed after the wedding. 

03:26.438 --> 03:27.839
            Daddy, why do       
            you have to say     

03:27.841 --> 03:29.941
such horrible things            
all the time?                   

03:29.943 --> 03:31.342
 No, that's all right, Gloria.  

03:31.344 --> 03:33.845
    Actually, your father's     
 on his best behavior tonight.  

03:33.847 --> 03:35.313
  I mean, haven't you noticed?  

03:35.315 --> 03:37.348
    He only called me           
     an unbeautiful thing.      

03:37.350 --> 03:39.684
    He could have called me     
     an unbeautiful Polack.     

03:39.686 --> 03:42.687
 The night is young, Meathead.  

03:42.689 --> 03:45.356
Oh, no, Archie,                 
it's not just tonight.          

03:45.358 --> 03:46.657
                You know, since 
                I've been living

03:46.659 --> 03:48.659
    in the house with you       
    the last couple of years,   

03:48.661 --> 03:50.228
                 I think I've   
                 influenced you.

03:50.230 --> 03:54.665
The only thing you've influenced
  around here is my food bill.  

03:54.667 --> 03:56.067
      Arch, you don't have      
         to get upset.          

03:56.069 --> 03:57.368
So you've mellowed a little bit.

03:57.370 --> 03:58.769
I mean, that could happen       
          to anybody.           

03:58.771 --> 03:59.770
                Get out of here.

03:59.772 --> 04:01.706
I think you're right,           
Michael.                        

04:01.708 --> 04:02.907
All those                       
nice quiet talks                

04:02.909 --> 04:03.908
you've had with Daddy--         

04:03.910 --> 04:05.310
you've had                      
a good effect on him.           

04:05.312 --> 04:06.911
  Nothing has no effect on me!  

04:06.913 --> 04:08.146
            What are you        
            talking about, Arch?

04:08.148 --> 04:09.147
                 You've changed.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.548
        I ain't changed.        

04:10.550 --> 04:11.549
                You have too.   

04:11.551 --> 04:12.550
    Get away from me.           

04:12.552 --> 04:15.419
Yeah, I think                   
he's right, Archie.             

04:15.421 --> 04:18.055
Like you haven't said           
the word "coon"                 

04:18.058 --> 04:20.124
in almost a year.               

04:22.494 --> 04:23.761
  What are you talking about?   

04:23.763 --> 04:25.496
      I say it every day.       

04:25.498 --> 04:27.098
You haven't said it             
in front of us.                 

04:27.100 --> 04:28.366
     Well, all right, then.     

04:28.368 --> 04:30.735
    Coon, coon, coon!           

04:30.737 --> 04:32.303
    You want it, you got it.    

04:32.305 --> 04:36.007
Oh, Archie, I'm sorry           
I reminded you.                 

04:36.009 --> 04:37.608
          Look, Arch,           

04:37.610 --> 04:39.443
     nobody's accusing you      
  of turning into a diplomat.   

04:39.445 --> 04:41.645
It's just that-- me living here 
the last couple of years--      

04:41.647 --> 04:43.248
I think I've worn you down      
             a bit.             

04:43.250 --> 04:44.849
         The only thing         
  you've worn down around here  

04:44.851 --> 04:45.716
    is your knife and fork.     

04:47.786 --> 04:49.854
Oh, look!                       

04:49.856 --> 04:53.591
Here's Mike's uncle Casimir     
eating cake.                    

04:53.593 --> 04:55.593
        Oh, yeah,               
  that proves you've mellowed.  

04:55.595 --> 04:57.561
    Remember the first time     
     you met my uncle Cas?      

04:57.563 --> 04:59.063
         Yeah, so what?         

04:59.065 --> 05:01.465
All right, so you remember      
the first time he came over here

05:01.467 --> 05:02.600
  to discuss the wedding plans  

05:02.602 --> 05:04.235
    and Ma had bought           
     those fancy pastries?      

05:04.237 --> 05:05.669
    Don't you remember          

05:05.671 --> 05:07.705
 <i>the first words you said</i>       
       <i>about my uncle Cas?</i>      

05:07.707 --> 05:09.573
        What's all              
    the fancy pastries for?     

05:09.575 --> 05:12.143
  Who the hell is your uncle,   
  the head janitor of Poland?   

05:12.145 --> 05:13.477
Daddy!                          

05:13.479 --> 05:14.979
            Look, Mr. Bunker,   
            I'm telling you--   

05:14.981 --> 05:16.080
Michael, Michael,               
calm down.                      

05:16.082 --> 05:17.081
Don't be angry!                 

05:17.083 --> 05:18.682
          I'm not angry, Gloria.

05:18.684 --> 05:20.584
        It's just-- We shouldn't
        have done it this way.  

05:20.586 --> 05:21.585
Well, it was your idea          

05:21.587 --> 05:23.254
to have your uncle over         
for coffee.                     

05:23.256 --> 05:24.522
      Yeah, that's because      
         I was worried          

05:24.524 --> 05:26.490
        about having him        
        over for dinner.        

05:26.492 --> 05:28.326
         I was worried          
  about all that dinner talk.   

05:28.328 --> 05:30.628
        Now I'm worried         
  about all that coffee talk.   

05:30.630 --> 05:31.963
Don't worry.                    

05:31.965 --> 05:33.697
Gloria, you don't know my uncle.

05:33.699 --> 05:35.566
      He's very sensitive       
      about Polish jokes,       

05:35.568 --> 05:37.168
    and your father's           
    out there in the kitchen    

05:37.170 --> 05:39.804
 sharpening up his repertoire.  

05:39.806 --> 05:42.673
  But, Michael, it's possible   
 that your uncle and my father  

05:42.675 --> 05:44.175
could get along just fine.      

05:44.177 --> 05:45.609
      You really think so?      

05:45.611 --> 05:47.979
    No.                         

05:47.981 --> 05:49.647
                    Gloria,     

05:49.649 --> 05:52.083
why can't we just do            
what we originally wanted?      

05:52.085 --> 05:53.851
        You mean,               
      just live together?       

05:53.853 --> 05:55.153
         Yeah, why not?         

05:55.155 --> 05:56.454
            Michael,            
don't even bring that up.       

05:56.456 --> 05:57.721
      You know my father.       

05:57.723 --> 06:00.925
      Gloria, it's not him      
      I want to live with.      

06:00.927 --> 06:02.260
                  Michael...    

06:04.096 --> 06:05.964
Hey, hotlips.                   

06:08.500 --> 06:09.500
You're doing that               

06:09.502 --> 06:11.135
in front of                     
her father here.                

06:11.137 --> 06:12.903
Uh, well,                       
we were just kissing.           

06:12.905 --> 06:16.341
      I know what it was.       

06:16.343 --> 06:19.777
    I seen it in the movies,    

06:19.779 --> 06:21.779
and if this is the preview      
of the coming attractions,      

06:21.781 --> 06:23.047
I don't want to see the picture.

06:24.316 --> 06:25.516
              You know, Daddy,  
              that's the trouble

06:25.518 --> 06:27.085
        with your               
    whole generation.           

06:27.087 --> 06:28.819
You're afraid to show affection 
            openly.             

06:28.821 --> 06:32.323
        We ain't afraid         
to show affection openly.       

06:32.325 --> 06:34.558
We believe in showing it openly 
    where it belongs,           

06:34.560 --> 06:35.626
      behind closed doors.      

06:37.863 --> 06:39.597
    We know all about           
        your love there.        

06:39.599 --> 06:41.065
    The only thing is,          

06:41.067 --> 06:42.266
        we don't believe        
      in smooching there,       

06:42.268 --> 06:44.568
     out in broad daylight,     
          that's all.           

06:44.570 --> 06:46.737
 We was a little bit romantic-- 

06:46.739 --> 06:50.475
  liked to do it in the dark,   
 like in a hallway or an alley. 

06:52.211 --> 06:54.278
             EDITH:             
    Hello, everybody!           

06:54.280 --> 06:56.247
  Oh, Ma, your new              
  dress looks lovely.           

06:56.249 --> 06:58.249
                Oh, you think   
                so, Gloria?     

06:58.251 --> 07:00.118
              Beautiful.        
You look terrific.              

07:00.120 --> 07:02.020
      Oh, thank you, Mike.      

07:02.022 --> 07:04.288
 Gloria, I hope you don't mind. 

07:04.290 --> 07:05.923
      I used your perfume.      

07:05.925 --> 07:07.525
         Do you like it, Archie?

07:07.527 --> 07:09.760
 Oh, Edith, move it over there, 
        will you?               

07:09.762 --> 07:14.899
It smells like you sprayed      
  yourself with a can of Raid.  

07:14.901 --> 07:16.534
What are you all dolled up for, 
            anyhow?             

07:16.536 --> 07:19.637
     Because we're meeting      
     Mike's uncle Casimir.      

07:19.639 --> 07:22.006
    You don't have to put on    
     a new dress for that.      

07:22.008 --> 07:24.342
        All you need is         
     a clean bowling shirt.     

07:25.944 --> 07:28.179
  Look, Mr. Bunker, I don't care
  what you say about me,        

07:28.181 --> 07:29.713
              but you'd better  
              watch what you say

07:29.715 --> 07:31.149
                 about my uncle.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.584
I ain't saying nothing personal 
        against the man.        

07:33.586 --> 07:34.985
For all I know, he may be,      

07:34.987 --> 07:36.587
        what do you call,       
    a very decent guy.          

07:36.589 --> 07:37.988
    The only thing is,          

07:37.990 --> 07:39.924
      he's got two strikes      
  against him from the start.   

07:39.926 --> 07:41.159
What do you mean by that?       

07:41.161 --> 07:43.094
 Well, he's Polish. Strike one. 

07:43.096 --> 07:44.095
                  Wait a second.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.497
And...he's Polish. Strike two.  

07:46.499 --> 07:48.099
                 You see what   
                 I mean, Gloria?

07:48.101 --> 07:49.300
    [TELEPHONE RINGS]           

07:49.302 --> 07:50.701
            Look, Mr. Bunker,   
 Hold it. Hold it.              

07:50.703 --> 07:51.869
    Hold your thought.          

07:51.871 --> 07:54.305
      I do believe I hear       
     the telephone ringing.     

07:54.307 --> 07:55.373
         "Excusez-moy."         

07:57.008 --> 07:59.410
Gloria, this is ridiculous!     
             Michael, calm down.

07:59.412 --> 08:00.611
         Don't lose your temper.
I haven't!                      

08:00.613 --> 08:02.012
I'm in complete                 
control of my temper!           

08:02.014 --> 08:03.081
                You're shouting!

08:03.083 --> 08:05.249
    I am not shouting!          
    I am not shouting!          

08:05.251 --> 08:08.152
     My temper just happens     
to be talking louder than usual.

08:08.154 --> 08:12.123
Hey, over there, I happen to be 
  on the telephone over here.   

08:12.125 --> 08:13.691
            Michael, don't throw
            everything away     

08:13.693 --> 08:14.692
                  because of    
                  a stupid joke.

08:14.694 --> 08:15.926
                Calm down.      

08:15.928 --> 08:17.695
    I'll try, Gloria,           
      but I'm telling you,      

08:17.697 --> 08:20.131
     one more Polish crack,     
  and I'm walking out of here!  

08:20.133 --> 08:21.999
      You know, they ought      
      to fumigate his mind,     

08:22.001 --> 08:24.268
if they can ever find it!       

08:24.270 --> 08:25.736
                Michael, please!

08:25.738 --> 08:27.838
            He'll be better when
            he gets to know you.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.540
                Maybe you can   
                help him change.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.775
  Please, just can't you control
  yourself a little longer?     

08:31.777 --> 08:32.909
        Why should              
    I control myself?           

08:32.912 --> 08:34.078
    What is that bull           

08:34.080 --> 08:35.679
     about my uncle having      
    two strikes against him     

08:35.681 --> 08:36.847
just because he's Polish?       

08:36.849 --> 08:38.448
Look, let me tell you something,
         Mr. Bunker...          

08:38.451 --> 08:39.650
Let me tell you                 
something there,                

08:39.652 --> 08:40.784
young fellow.                   

08:40.785 --> 08:43.121
        I just got              
  off of the telephone here--   

08:43.123 --> 08:46.591
            a guy--             
 a gent called Casimir Stivic-- 

08:46.593 --> 08:47.992
     your uncle, I presume,     

08:47.994 --> 08:50.094
        calling me from         
    the corner phone booth.     

08:50.096 --> 08:52.163
        The reason              
he ain't at the house yet       

08:52.165 --> 08:55.766
          is that, uh,          
     he forgot the number.      

08:55.768 --> 08:57.301
Strike three. Case closed.      

08:57.303 --> 09:00.070
    That's it! That's it!       
    I lost my temper!           

09:00.072 --> 09:01.339
                      Michael!  
                      Michael!  

09:01.341 --> 09:02.540
Look, Gloria, Gloria,           
you don't understand.           

09:02.542 --> 09:03.807
My uncle--                      
he's not going to               

09:03.809 --> 09:04.875
put up with                     
that stuff!                     

09:04.877 --> 09:06.877
          Now, Archie,          
    you'd better be careful     

09:06.879 --> 09:09.180
            what you say        
            around Mike's uncle.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.748
I'll do better than that, Edith.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.950
  I won't say nothing at all.   

09:12.952 --> 09:14.352
Oh, this is                     
going to be great.              

09:14.354 --> 09:15.753
Let's just forget               
the whole thing, Gloria.        

09:15.755 --> 09:17.255
                    No!         

09:17.257 --> 09:19.056
        Michael's uncle has come
        all the way from Chicago

09:19.058 --> 09:20.124
                 to meet us     

09:20.126 --> 09:21.459
         and discuss the wedding
         with you.              

09:21.461 --> 09:24.928
I ain't interested in discussing
    no wedding arrangements     

09:24.930 --> 09:27.398
  with no uncle from Chicago.   

09:27.400 --> 09:30.801
    The guy ain't even          
     a "bona fried" parent.     

09:30.803 --> 09:32.670
Look, what do you want          
from me, Mr. Bunker?            

09:32.672 --> 09:35.005
My mother and father died       
when I was little.              

09:35.007 --> 09:36.674
 Listen, I'm sorry about that.  

09:36.676 --> 09:37.875
    All I'm saying is           

09:37.877 --> 09:39.843
    I don't want to discuss     
    no wedding arrangements     

09:39.845 --> 09:42.280
    with a "substitute-ski."    

09:42.282 --> 09:43.648
Oh!                             

09:43.650 --> 09:45.015
This is not                     
going to work.                  

09:45.017 --> 09:47.084
Oh, Ma, can't you talk          
to him, please?                 

09:47.086 --> 09:49.287
            I'll try, Gloria.   

09:49.289 --> 09:50.288
                    Archie...   

09:50.290 --> 09:52.790
          Stifle.               

09:52.792 --> 09:55.092
                I guess I can't,
                Gloria.         

09:55.094 --> 09:56.494
              Daddy, all I'm    
              asking you to do  

09:56.496 --> 09:58.128
            is meet his uncle   
            halfway.            

09:58.130 --> 10:01.432
  I mean, he's a self-made man  
     like yourself, Daddy.      

10:01.434 --> 10:03.934
  You see, you two might find   
you have a lot in common.       

10:03.936 --> 10:06.504
 Oh, yeah? What does the guy do 
         for a living?          

10:06.506 --> 10:07.438
        He's a florist.         

10:09.841 --> 10:11.141
        A florist?              

10:13.579 --> 10:16.247
What does a Polish florist sell?

10:16.249 --> 10:17.481
             Weeds?             

10:19.184 --> 10:20.218
That's right,                   
Mr. Bunker!                     

10:20.220 --> 10:22.353
He sells plenty of weeds        
to guys like you!               

10:22.355 --> 10:23.954
            What do you mean,   
            guys like me?       

10:23.956 --> 10:26.123
  I think it must be wonderful  
      to work with flowers      

10:26.125 --> 10:28.092
and be surrounded by them       
         all day long.          

10:28.094 --> 10:30.194
Ah, what kind of a job is that--

10:30.196 --> 10:33.997
        prancing around         
  amongst the pansies all day?  

10:33.999 --> 10:35.866
  That's what I call dumb work  
        for a man.              

10:35.868 --> 10:37.101
What's dumb about               
trying to bring                 

10:37.103 --> 10:38.302
a little beauty                 
into the world?                 

10:38.304 --> 10:40.504
  I ain't talking about that.

    All I'm saying is

     that a real man ought      
 to be doing something useful,

10:49.349 --> 10:52.283
         Okay, Daddy, but people
         need florists too,     

10:52.285 --> 10:53.751
         and painters and poets.

10:53.753 --> 10:57.355

11:01.861 --> 11:03.761
 reading poetry at one another. 

11:03.763 --> 11:05.162
    Then you flip over          
      to another channel,

 and you see a couple of he-men

you decide about the plans,     

17:00.019 --> 17:02.219
as long as we have Chinese food 
for the reception.              

17:02.221 --> 17:03.888
    Yeah, that's what           
     Michael and I decided.     

17:03.890 --> 17:04.888
    It's our favorite.          

17:04.891 --> 17:06.522
Ah, wait a minute,              
wait a minute.                  

17:06.525 --> 17:07.892
You ain't eating                
no Chinky food                  

17:07.894 --> 17:10.660
at this here wedding.           

17:10.662 --> 17:12.695
     That's "Chinese" food.     

17:12.698 --> 17:15.132
      Chinese or whatever.      

17:15.134 --> 17:17.334
          Chinese food          
is for a Chinese wedding.       

17:17.336 --> 17:19.736
    At an American wedding,     
     you eat American food.     

17:19.738 --> 17:21.505
You don't see Julie Nixon       
      and David Eisenhower      

17:21.507 --> 17:24.208
eating Chinks at their wedding, 
            do you?             

17:24.210 --> 17:25.742
 How do you know what they ate? 

17:25.743 --> 17:27.577
  Because in the first place,   

17:27.579 --> 17:30.114
    Chinky food at a wedding    
          ain't fancy.          

17:30.116 --> 17:31.615
      In the second place,      
        anything Chinky         

17:31.617 --> 17:34.351
     is ix-nay with Nixon,      
        and he's right.         

17:34.353 --> 17:36.387
Wait a second,                  
wait a second, Mr. Bunker.      

17:36.389 --> 17:37.388
                    No, Michael.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.689
No, no, I want                  
to make a point here.           

17:39.691 --> 17:41.158
Mr. Bunker, I think             
that before long,               

17:41.160 --> 17:42.893
this country's going            
to recognize China,             

17:42.895 --> 17:44.361
  and I wouldn't be surprised   

17:44.363 --> 17:46.030
        if one day              
Nixon went there himself.       

17:46.032 --> 17:50.100
Nixon make a trip to Red China? 

17:50.102 --> 17:52.469
Never in a million years, buddy.

17:52.471 --> 17:55.172
    And remember where          
 you heard that the first time. 

17:57.675 --> 17:59.876
    And I don't want to talk    
this crazy stuff with you.      

17:59.878 --> 18:01.245
    All I'm saying is,          

18:01.247 --> 18:03.247
     there's going to be no     
  Chinky food at this wedding.  

18:03.249 --> 18:04.248
        Right, Casimir?         

18:04.250 --> 18:06.283
             Wrong.             

18:06.285 --> 18:09.453
  Yeah, my side of the family   
    votes for Chinese food.     

18:09.455 --> 18:11.188
MIKE AND GLORIA:                
Yeah.                           

18:11.190 --> 18:15.092
    Oh, well, what the hell.    

18:15.094 --> 18:16.460
You voting me down there,       

18:16.462 --> 18:18.362
      I guess you can have      
      what you want, then.      

18:18.364 --> 18:19.563
     Only I'm warning you,      

18:19.565 --> 18:21.565
      I ain't going to eat      
    a spoonful of the stuff.    

18:21.567 --> 18:22.766
         I'll send out.         

18:22.768 --> 18:24.168
      I'll order something      
      sent in for myself,       

18:24.170 --> 18:25.735
      something American,       
         like a pizza.          

18:29.807 --> 18:31.541
      Go ahead, stuff yourselves
      with Chinky food          

18:31.543 --> 18:32.876
                 if you want to.

18:32.878 --> 18:34.478
                 Ain't no skin  
                 off of my nose.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.546
            Casimir here is     
            springing for it.   

18:36.548 --> 18:38.748
Oh, no, Archie.                 

18:38.750 --> 18:40.584
The father                      
of the bride                    

18:40.586 --> 18:42.819
always pays                     
for everything.                 

18:42.821 --> 18:45.522
We wouldn't think               
of letting him pay.             

18:45.524 --> 18:49.093
        Yes, we would, Edith.   

18:49.095 --> 18:51.261
  In fact, that's what          
  we were thinking of right now.

18:51.263 --> 18:53.330
Daddy, you're spoiling          
everything.                     

18:53.332 --> 18:54.865
I ain't spoiling nothing.       

18:54.867 --> 18:57.534
     I'm holding up my end      
      in everything here.       

18:57.536 --> 18:58.668
          Show you what I mean--

18:58.670 --> 19:00.070
            you don't have to   
            have your shindig   

19:00.072 --> 19:01.372
                    in that big 
                    rented hall.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.240
                 You can have it
                 right here.    

19:03.242 --> 19:04.274
Here in                         
the house?                      

19:04.276 --> 19:06.676
    Right here in my house.     

19:06.678 --> 19:09.446
  The rented hall is too big,   
    it's too drafty...          

19:09.448 --> 19:10.747
         Too expensive.         

19:13.418 --> 19:15.319
            Was you told        
            something before?   

19:15.321 --> 19:17.154
            Stifle?             

19:17.156 --> 19:18.055
             Bingo!             

19:20.325 --> 19:21.658
                 Well, if you're
                 going to have  

19:21.660 --> 19:23.260
                  the party here
                  in the house, 

19:23.262 --> 19:24.561
                    I guess all 
                    you can have

19:24.563 --> 19:25.795
                is the immediate
                family.         

19:25.797 --> 19:27.964
Right, and the less             
of them the better.             

19:27.966 --> 19:31.035
      My, a wedding party       
         in the house.          

19:31.037 --> 19:33.870
        We can decorate         
     the whole downstairs.      

19:33.872 --> 19:36.740
      I'll tell you what.       
 I'll do the flower arranging.  

19:36.742 --> 19:37.741
Whoop-dee-do.                   

19:37.743 --> 19:39.309
I'll whip up                    
a batch of cookies.             

19:41.612 --> 19:43.213
  Hey, Arch, what about music?  

19:43.215 --> 19:45.215
Well, I ain't going to pay      
     for nothing like that.     

19:45.217 --> 19:47.518
 It won't cost nothing, Archie. 

19:47.520 --> 19:50.587
     The Reverend Felcher's     
 going to perform the ceremony. 

19:50.589 --> 19:54.091
     I'll ask Mrs. Felcher      
    to play the piano.          

19:54.093 --> 19:55.092
    Hold it, hold it.           

19:55.094 --> 19:56.893
         Mrs. Felcher?          

19:56.895 --> 19:58.328
What kind of priest has a wife? 

19:58.330 --> 19:59.896
     Oh, he ain't a priest.     

19:59.898 --> 20:02.332
    He's the minister           
        from our church.        

20:02.334 --> 20:07.938
Oh, he's the minister           
of the church, huh?             

20:07.940 --> 20:10.207
Well, he ain't performing       
         this ceremony!         

20:10.209 --> 20:11.942
What's the matter,              
Uncle Cas? Why not?             

20:11.944 --> 20:13.477
It doesn't mean                 
anything to me.                 

20:13.479 --> 20:14.978
Well, it means something to me, 

20:14.980 --> 20:16.813
     and it meant something     
        to your father.         

20:16.815 --> 20:18.915
    Now, you were born          
    and baptized a Catholic,    

20:18.917 --> 20:21.418
and I promised your father      
    that when the time came,    

20:21.420 --> 20:23.887
a priest would administer       
the sacrament of marriage.      

20:23.889 --> 20:25.189
    Hold it. Hold it.           

20:25.191 --> 20:27.324
     I got something to say     
        about this here.        

20:27.326 --> 20:29.326
     I ain't going through      
 with none of these ceremonies  

20:29.328 --> 20:31.061
  with all that mumbo jumbo--   

20:31.063 --> 20:34.164
some Catholic priest sprinkling 
    "incest" over everybody.    

20:40.371 --> 20:43.173
            My nephew's getting 
            married by a priest.

20:43.175 --> 20:44.408
      That's okay with me,      

20:44.410 --> 20:46.610
    but my daughter is going    
to get married in a church      

20:46.612 --> 20:48.445
     where she's been going     
      and we've been going      

20:48.447 --> 20:49.446
         all our lives,         

20:49.448 --> 20:50.880
    by this other guy,          
         the reverend--         

20:50.882 --> 20:51.881
     What do you call him?      

20:54.419 --> 20:55.419
            Felcher.            

20:55.421 --> 20:56.620
     Yeah, well, whatever.      

20:56.622 --> 20:59.389
Wait a minute. Why              
doesn't somebody ask us?        

20:59.391 --> 21:00.524
                    Yeah, in the
                    first place,

21:00.526 --> 21:02.226
         we never wanted        
         a priest or a reverend.

21:02.228 --> 21:03.227
             What?              

21:03.229 --> 21:04.461
  What are you talking about?   

21:04.463 --> 21:07.030
    Mike, I don't understand.   

21:07.032 --> 21:09.233
 It's very simple, Mrs. Bunker. 

21:09.235 --> 21:10.267
        I'm an agnostic.        

21:10.269 --> 21:12.436
              Oh.               

21:14.105 --> 21:16.473
You mean you want a rabbi?      

21:20.378 --> 21:23.013
  It's worse than that, Edith.  

21:23.015 --> 21:24.681
        I think it means        
      he can't have kids.       

21:32.123 --> 21:34.158
Daddy, an agnostic              
is a person                     

21:34.160 --> 21:36.293
who questions                   
the existence of God.           

21:36.295 --> 21:38.862
 Well, I question the existence 
     of this whole wedding.     

21:38.864 --> 21:40.230
Fine, fine,                     

21:40.232 --> 21:41.431
we don't have to                
get married.                    

21:41.433 --> 21:42.832
            You're damn right   
            you don't.          

21:42.834 --> 21:44.034
That's right, we'll             
just live together.             

21:44.036 --> 21:45.135
Michael!                        
                What?           

21:45.137 --> 21:46.203
                 Mickey, what   
                 are you saying?

21:46.205 --> 21:47.671
         No, I'm sorry,         
    Uncle Cas, but...           

21:47.673 --> 21:49.506
Michael, why did                
you bring that up?              

21:49.508 --> 21:50.507
          Well, why not, Gloria?

21:50.509 --> 21:51.975
I mean, this whole              
thing is ridiculous.            

21:51.977 --> 21:53.076
You don't like the idea         

21:53.078 --> 21:54.311
of other people                 
making our decision?            

21:54.313 --> 21:56.180
                Michael, please!
Gloria, isn't this our life?    

21:56.182 --> 21:57.347
            Yes, Michael--      

21:57.349 --> 21:59.550
All right, so do you want       
your father and my uncle        

21:59.552 --> 22:00.950
to make suggestions             
on everything we do--           

22:00.952 --> 22:02.752
how to dress, eat,              
sleep, make love?               

22:02.754 --> 22:04.154
        Hold it, there!         

22:04.156 --> 22:07.023
I don't like that last one      
    in mixed company.           

22:07.025 --> 22:08.525
Does that bother                
you, Mr. Bunker?                

22:08.527 --> 22:09.926
Because whether                 
you like it or not,             

22:09.928 --> 22:11.928
people do make love             
every now and then.             

22:11.930 --> 22:14.631
      More then than now.       

22:22.240 --> 22:25.509
Will you stifle yourself?       

22:25.511 --> 22:26.910
         I'll tell you          
    the kind of people          

22:26.912 --> 22:27.911
        that does them things   

22:27.913 --> 22:29.145
                 without benefit
                 of clergy--    

22:29.147 --> 22:30.514
                your communists,
                your hippies,   

22:30.516 --> 22:32.749
            and worst of all,   
            your fags.          

22:32.751 --> 22:36.119
        Oh, no, Archie,         
    I read in <i>LIFE</i> magazine     

22:36.121 --> 22:38.222
 even they're getting married.  

22:38.224 --> 22:40.357
Do you want your daughter       

22:40.359 --> 22:42.158
living in sin with this         
dumb Polack over here?          

22:42.160 --> 22:43.159
         Just a second,         
            Bunker!             

22:43.161 --> 22:44.528
No, no, no, no, Uncle Cas.      

22:44.530 --> 22:45.762
Let me handle this.             

22:45.764 --> 22:47.864
You call me a dumb Polack,      
Mr. Bunker?                     

22:47.866 --> 22:49.065
Well, let me tell you something.

22:49.067 --> 22:50.834
This dumb Polack                
is smart enough to know         

22:50.836 --> 22:52.269
that he's not dumb enough       

22:52.271 --> 22:53.970
to have this nonsense           
shoved down our throats.        

22:53.972 --> 22:55.038
Michael, don't say              
those things.                   

22:55.040 --> 22:56.440
            No, no,             
    I'm saying it right now.    

22:56.442 --> 22:57.441
      This wedding's off.       

22:57.443 --> 22:58.442
Michael, where                  
are you going?                  

22:58.444 --> 23:00.176
ARCHIE: Let him go.             
let him go.                     

23:00.178 --> 23:01.645
              The wedding's off!

23:01.647 --> 23:04.080
                    Michael!    

23:04.082 --> 23:06.550
                [BAWLING]       

23:06.552 --> 23:09.253
Gloria,                         
Gloria.                         

23:09.255 --> 23:11.020
Calm down!                      

23:12.990 --> 23:14.591
This wedding is going           
to be all right.                

23:14.593 --> 23:16.993
Mickey'll come back.            

23:16.995 --> 23:19.863
          Oh, Archie,           
    we'll get them married.     

23:19.865 --> 23:22.065
      Yeah, when the kids       
      are off on their honeymoon

23:22.067 --> 23:24.668
              and everything    
              is back to normal,

23:24.670 --> 23:26.637
        I'm going to come around
        and see you again.      

23:28.306 --> 23:29.339
What for?                       

23:29.341 --> 23:32.842
            So I can beat       
            the hell out of you.

23:48.893 --> 23:50.294
        Yeah, I remember        

23:50.296 --> 23:52.929
      your charming uncle       
    from Chicago, all right.    

23:52.931 --> 23:56.733
     I tried hard to be nice    
     and polite to the big slob,

23:56.735 --> 23:58.702
          but when he left here,
          he was threatening me.

23:58.704 --> 23:59.869
Oh, come on, Arch,              

23:59.871 --> 24:01.672
my uncle wouldn't have          
done a thing like that.         

24:01.674 --> 24:02.673
        How do you know?        

24:02.675 --> 24:04.107
  You wasn't even in the room.  

24:04.109 --> 24:06.510
  He swore he'd come back here  
with a whole bunch of guys      

24:06.512 --> 24:08.745
    and work me over.           

24:08.747 --> 24:09.913
      Arch, you're lying.       

24:09.915 --> 24:11.715
      What are you saying       
     a thing like that for?     

24:11.717 --> 24:15.018
    Archie, you're spoiling     
        the anniversary.        

24:15.020 --> 24:16.119
                 Yeah, just like

24:16.121 --> 24:17.621
              you almost spoiled
              the wedding.      

24:17.623 --> 24:19.889
Listen, the only one that       
  spoiled anything around here  

24:19.891 --> 24:20.890
    was the meathead.           

24:20.892 --> 24:21.958
     He spoiled everything.     

24:21.960 --> 24:23.427
What are you                    
talking about?                  

24:23.429 --> 24:24.728
I came back, didn't I?          

24:24.730 --> 24:27.698
 That's what I'm talking about. 

24:27.700 --> 24:29.232
                    Aw, come on,
                    Arch.       

24:29.234 --> 24:31.435
    What do you have to start   
    a thing like that for?
