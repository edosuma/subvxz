WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.238
Wade likes you. I don't
want to see him get hurt.

00:04.238 --> 00:05.339
You never wanted to help me.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.474
The only thing
you wanted was him.

00:06.474 --> 00:08.609
Let me tell you something,
Zoe Hart.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.278
George Tucker and Lemon Breeland
are getting married.

00:10.278 --> 00:13.013
We owe it to each other to
try and make this thing work.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.882
Because you love her.
I do.

00:14.882 --> 00:16.784
You of all people know how
I feel about Frederick Dean.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.919
There's just one problem:
my mom won't let me date.

00:18.919 --> 00:19.953
You have to talk to her.

00:19.953 --> 00:20.954
I thought maybe you would

00:20.954 --> 00:22.190
consider reconsidering.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.357
Fine, you win.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.225
ZOE: Her appendix?

00:24.225 --> 00:25.893
Yeah, no, it burst.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.561
You said she would be fine!

00:27.561 --> 00:28.762
(siren wailing)

00:35.069 --> 00:36.437
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.506
I'm Dr. Hart; I have
been trying for hours

00:38.506 --> 00:40.574
to get information on a patient.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.843
Rose Hattenbarger--
she was brought here last night

00:42.843 --> 00:44.245
with a ruptured appendix.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.846
You're not family?
No, but we're very close.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.248
And you're not
her doctor.

00:47.248 --> 00:50.584
Dr. Breeland is, but I had
temporary privileges here

00:50.584 --> 00:51.585
not that long ago.

00:51.585 --> 00:52.620
Yes, I know.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.088
You assisted on a mitral
valve replacement.

00:54.088 --> 00:55.456
Yeah.

00:55.456 --> 00:58.126
A procedure some surgeons
here waited years to do,

00:58.126 --> 00:59.827
because your daddy
said you could.

00:59.827 --> 01:03.264
Don't you think that's enough
special treatment for one month?

01:03.931 --> 01:04.965
Zoe.

01:04.965 --> 01:06.267
Brick!

01:06.267 --> 01:08.536
How is Rose? No one here
will tell me anything.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.338
There were complications
from the perforation.

01:10.338 --> 01:11.272
What kind of complications?

01:11.272 --> 01:13.141
An abscess formed.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.175
There's sepsis.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.876
How extensive?

01:15.876 --> 01:18.346
Don't know yet. They're managing
the infection aggressively--

01:18.346 --> 01:20.281
they'll let us know
in an hour--

01:20.281 --> 01:22.850
but, for now,
it-it could go either way.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.854
What is she doing here?
Annie, it's okay.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.422
It is not okay!

01:28.422 --> 01:30.591
You're supposed to be a doctor!

01:30.591 --> 01:31.659
You should go.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.294
It's why I let her
hang out with you.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.295
Now look, she could die.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.896
What is wrong with you?!

01:35.896 --> 01:38.098
I'm sorry.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.504
* *

01:51.812 --> 01:53.113
(line ringing)

01:53.113 --> 01:55.183
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Please leave a message
after the tone.

01:55.183 --> 01:56.184
(phone beeps)

01:56.184 --> 01:57.851
Dad, it's Zoe.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.754
Look, you don't
have to call me back.

02:00.754 --> 02:04.091
I don't even know
why I am calling.

02:04.091 --> 02:06.026
It's just,
for various reasons,

02:06.026 --> 02:09.297
I don't have anyone else
in my life at the moment.

02:09.297 --> 02:12.366
A friend of mine
is in the hospital--

02:12.366 --> 02:13.701
appendiceal rupture.

02:13.701 --> 02:17.805
We'll have a prognosis
any minute.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.641
So, yeah.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.643
She's 14.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.078
Rose.

02:25.078 --> 02:29.250
Anyway, like I said, I don't
even know why I'm calling.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.419
It'll be fine.

02:31.419 --> 02:32.220
Bye.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.454
BRICK: Hey.

02:33.454 --> 02:36.357
One of the nurses
said you were down here.

02:36.357 --> 02:38.025
How is she?
Well, the antibiotics
are working.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.293
She's out of the woods.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.494
In fact, she's conscious.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.196
They transferred her
out of the ICU,

02:42.196 --> 02:45.199
and she's asking for you.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.272
Maybe Dr. Hart has
some news about Rose.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.106
Do you, uh, do you
know where she is?

02:53.106 --> 02:54.675
Why would I know where she is?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.076
Or even care?

02:56.076 --> 02:57.378
If you read
in a book somewhere

02:57.378 --> 02:58.679
that I'm the world's
leading expert

02:58.679 --> 03:00.180
on the whereabouts
or migratory patterns

03:00.180 --> 03:04.352
of Dr. Zoe Hart, well, I suggest
you contact the publisher,

03:04.352 --> 03:05.719
because it's wrong.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.121
What?

03:08.121 --> 03:09.723
Everybody,

03:09.723 --> 03:10.524
that was Daddy.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.093
Rose is going to be just fine.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.828
(applause, crowd sighing)

03:15.596 --> 03:17.398
That's great news, baby.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.632
I got to get going.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.133
Can I walk you home?
Yeah.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.670
Lemon, a whole bunch
of people are going

03:22.670 --> 03:24.405
to the hospital today
if Rose was okay,

03:24.405 --> 03:25.839
and I really
want to go.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.108
Of course. I didn't realize
you two were friendly.

03:28.108 --> 03:30.378
Well, this whole thing
has reminded me

03:30.378 --> 03:32.212
how all life is precious.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.582
Even the ones that seem
so insignificant.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.817
Okay.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.953
(both chuckle)

03:41.054 --> 03:42.256
(clears throat)

03:52.300 --> 03:53.467
People! People!

03:53.467 --> 03:54.835
Before everyone
scatters,

03:54.835 --> 03:57.738
don't forget the Disaster
Preparedness Drill.

03:57.738 --> 03:58.706
Storm season

03:58.706 --> 04:00.741
is upon us,
and we need to be ready.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.411
So, before the meeting
tonight, see me

04:03.411 --> 04:05.379
or my lieutenant Wanda here

04:05.379 --> 04:06.780
for your assignments.

04:08.181 --> 04:09.317
Lieutenant!

04:09.317 --> 04:10.651
(chuckles)

04:10.651 --> 04:11.819
When is this drill
supposed to be?

04:11.819 --> 04:13.454
I can't say.
It's a surprise.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.356
Well, there are a lot
of good TV shows on this month,

04:15.356 --> 04:17.124
and I need to know
whether or not to set my DVR.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.526
Well, I suggest
everybody set

04:18.526 --> 04:20.093
their DVR for anything
they don't want to miss.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.430
Well, what about shows like
 America's Next Top Model?

04:22.430 --> 04:23.864
Because if I start
to record it,

04:23.864 --> 04:26.600
somebody gonna tell me
who won before I watch it.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.602
I'm talking about
a killer storm.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.471
To survive, we need
to pull together,

04:30.471 --> 04:32.673
everyone doing their
assigned jobs, whether it be

04:32.673 --> 04:35.409
helping the wounded,
boiling bed sheets,

04:35.409 --> 04:37.345
or sterilizing saws
for field amputations.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.879
This is an old list.

04:39.880 --> 04:43.684
So I was thinking
that maybe it might be

04:43.684 --> 04:46.687
nice to order in some dinner
at your place tonight.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.889
Sure. Yeah,
we-we could do that.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.960
Celebrate us being
back on track...

04:52.960 --> 04:55.095
Mm-hmm.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.197
...with a night
of romance.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.732
Oh.

04:58.732 --> 05:02.903
Um... yeah, we should,
we should probably do that.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.238
Definitely.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.007
Or you know what?

05:07.007 --> 05:09.443
It's so close, why don't we just
wait till the wedding night?

05:09.443 --> 05:10.978
Oh, uh, that would be fun.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.245
Yeah.
Romantic.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.347
I mean, unless you...

05:13.347 --> 05:16.650
I love it, I love it.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.988
Hello?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.356
Ta-dah!

05:22.356 --> 05:24.191
Ta-dah, what?

05:24.191 --> 05:28.362
You left me a note saying
to meet here, didn't say why.

05:28.362 --> 05:29.530
(sighs)

05:29.530 --> 05:31.665
I used to bring girls here
to make out.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.667
I sincerely hope that's not
where this is going.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.203
No, I found this
building for sale.

05:36.203 --> 05:40.140
Now, you know, it needs a
little work, but picture it.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.309
Wade's Place.

05:42.309 --> 05:44.244
Wade's Place?

05:44.244 --> 05:46.480
Ta-dah!

05:46.480 --> 05:48.682
Stop doing that, seriously.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.317
And I already
have a place, okay?

05:50.317 --> 05:52.520
It's at your place.
(sighs)

05:53.887 --> 05:55.889
Wade's Place.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.426
Your bar.

05:58.426 --> 06:01.829
My...

06:01.829 --> 06:06.166
Look, Lavon, Zoe already
lost me the race money.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.435
I don't have
any cash.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.069
Which is why we have
an appointment

06:09.069 --> 06:12.105
with Peggy at the bank tomorrow,
talk about a loan.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.275
Really?
Uh-huh.

06:15.275 --> 06:17.377
Wade's Place.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.379
Ta-dah!

06:19.379 --> 06:21.482
Seriously, stop.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.586
ADDY: Morning.
Hi, Addy.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.054
Tried calling. Wanted
to see how Rose is.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.689
Oh, Brick left a message.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.257
She's awake and stable.

06:30.257 --> 06:33.026
Her fever is down
and the infection is subsiding.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.095
They're gonna hold her
in the hospital for rehydration

06:35.095 --> 06:36.229
and post-op recovery.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.265
Yeah, I know all that. I
want to know how she is.

06:38.265 --> 06:39.733
I don't know.
Why not?

06:39.733 --> 06:40.934
Because I didn't see her.

06:40.934 --> 06:41.835
Why not?

06:41.835 --> 06:43.504
'Cause I couldn't do it.

06:43.504 --> 06:46.206
I'm sorry, but I couldn't walk
in that room and look at her,

06:46.206 --> 06:48.909
knowing that I'm the one
who almost killed her.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.880
What in the world are
you talking about?

06:52.880 --> 06:54.414
Rose's mother was right.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.916
I'm a doctor.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.719
Yesterday, she presented
with abdominal pains,

06:58.719 --> 07:00.488
lack of appetite and nausea.

07:00.488 --> 07:01.889
Signs of possible
appendicitis,

07:01.889 --> 07:04.191
which a doctor
would have seen.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.793
Are you out of your mind?

07:05.793 --> 07:08.596
I-I know you can't possibly
think any of that's on you.

07:08.596 --> 07:11.665
I took my eye off the ball
and someone almost died!

07:11.665 --> 07:13.834
So no more getting involved
with patients.

07:13.834 --> 07:14.635
From now on,

07:14.635 --> 07:15.703
if anyone needs a friend,

07:15.703 --> 07:16.937
they can join Facebook.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.506
All they're getting
from Dr. Zoe Hart

07:18.506 --> 07:21.709
is a doctor.

07:25.012 --> 07:28.181
(car horn honks)

07:28.181 --> 07:31.084
(seagulls calling)

07:31.084 --> 07:32.553
(birds singing)

07:38.025 --> 07:39.660
AnnaBeth Nass
and her husband Jake?

07:39.660 --> 07:41.962
He's mowing the lawn
in the middle of the night,

07:41.962 --> 07:44.865
banging trash cans
around at all hours.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.199
Right. So...

07:46.199 --> 07:47.568
you need a sleeping pill.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.302
Once I'm awake,
I can't get back to sleep.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.672
I start thinking about
my grandson in Pensacola.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.474
Oh... he's in a terrible mess
down there.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.876
You mean Charlie?

07:55.876 --> 07:58.646
Why? What happened?
He was doing...

07:58.646 --> 08:01.549
Never mind.

08:01.549 --> 08:02.950
DELMA: You know

08:02.950 --> 08:04.718
Annabeth, right? Maybe you could

08:04.718 --> 08:06.486
talk to her.
No.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.255
No, I can't. I'm sorry.

08:12.292 --> 08:15.996
CRICKETT:
Jordan almonds always remind me
of my sister Corky's wedding.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.299
She put the almonds in the same
color little bags as the rice.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.535
People got them mixed up,
so when the couple came out

08:21.535 --> 08:24.037
of the church, they might
as well have gotten
stoned to death.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.305
They were like
Bonnie and Clyde

08:25.305 --> 08:27.240
going down in a
hail of gunfire.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.342
Ow.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.244
You okay?

08:31.244 --> 08:33.113
Mm-hmm. Oh, yes.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.783
Just a twinge. Yoga.

08:35.783 --> 08:38.318
Yoga?
Hmm. I've been doing more yoga

08:38.318 --> 08:40.754
after I read this thing
in a magazine that said

08:40.754 --> 08:41.855
yoga makes sex better.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.890
Ever since my husband

08:43.890 --> 08:45.325
got that new job of his,

08:45.325 --> 08:47.995
he's feeling so much
happier about things that...

08:47.995 --> 08:50.063
he just wants
to have sex all the ti-ime.

08:50.063 --> 08:53.066
I'm gonna go get some aspirin.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.171
Since when did
it become okay

08:58.171 --> 09:00.540
to talk about private
things out loud?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.643
I think it's those
new TV comedies.

09:02.643 --> 09:05.012
Me, I've never felt
so empowered.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.948
(gasps) Speaking of
such things, you must be

09:07.948 --> 09:09.549
so excited for your honeymoon.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.285
Of course I am.
Why wouldn't I be?

09:12.285 --> 09:13.587
Lemon...

09:13.587 --> 09:16.523
if you want
to talk about....
Well,

09:16.523 --> 09:19.292
it's not sex.
It's, um...

09:19.292 --> 09:20.894
it's tennis.

09:20.894 --> 09:21.561
Tennis?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.230
Yeah, see...

09:23.230 --> 09:26.266
George and I want to play
tennis on our honeymoon,

09:26.266 --> 09:30.070
uh, but lately our tennis
has been infrequent.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.640
And, um, we used to
play tennis all the time.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.843
And George went to New York
and well, I...

09:35.843 --> 09:38.311
I played tennis
with somebody else and...

09:38.311 --> 09:41.081
when George found out he just
doesn't really want to...

09:41.081 --> 09:43.350
play tennis with me anymore.
Well,

09:43.350 --> 09:45.819
I don't play tennis myself,
on account of the sun.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.487
But, uh, it kind of
reminds me of that time

09:47.487 --> 09:49.957
that my husband found out
I'd slept with this guy

09:49.957 --> 09:51.925
before we met, and
he just couldn't stop

09:51.925 --> 09:55.028
thinking about me with this
other man, and we almost quit

09:55.028 --> 09:56.229
having sex.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.597
Anyway, back to tennis.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.599
B-But what, back,
back to the, um,

09:59.599 --> 10:01.134
sex, um...

10:01.134 --> 10:04.237
what did you do
about that exactly?

10:04.237 --> 10:07.540
You just need to get George
back on that tennis court.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.010
Get a cute outfit.
Trick him

10:10.010 --> 10:11.779
into showing up
if you have to.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.947
Once he gets there,
it'll all come back.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.384
Oh, my God, Crickett,
you are so right!

10:17.384 --> 10:20.153
Ha! Goodness, now that's
something you don't hear a lot.
See, I just

10:20.153 --> 10:21.889
need to get George
back on the court

10:21.889 --> 10:25.125
and make it the best tennis
he's ever had... played.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.294
All right, before the
honeymoon, I'm just gonna

10:27.294 --> 10:30.230
make him fall in love with me
and my tennis all over again.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.264
That's right.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.432
Or try doubles.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.367
I hear that's fun.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.636
(laughs) No.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.471
ROSE: Hey, Mom,

10:38.471 --> 10:39.539
did Zoe come by yet?

10:39.539 --> 10:41.641
No, she hasn't.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.643
Oh, she's ...

10:43.643 --> 10:45.946
probably just busy at work.

10:45.946 --> 10:49.049
I'm sure she'll
come by later.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.551
Rose...

10:51.551 --> 10:53.020
ANNIE: Magnolia.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.288
Come in.
Mrs. Hattenbarger.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.690
Rose.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.158
What's going on?
Did you get sentenced

10:58.158 --> 11:00.527
to community service
or something?
No.

11:00.527 --> 11:01.995
I wanted to see how you are.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.363
Look, I know we
have not been

11:03.363 --> 11:06.299
so close, but having
this happen to someone I know,

11:06.299 --> 11:09.402
someone my own age, just really
makes me think about myself.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.739
More than usual?

11:12.806 --> 11:14.775
(sighing): I mean...

11:14.775 --> 11:17.677
thank you for
the chocolates.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.286
My neighbor, Delma Warner,
told me she complained to you

11:26.286 --> 11:29.256
about my husband and me
keeping her up at night.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.692
It's because of Jake's new job.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.194
He works so many hours,

11:34.194 --> 11:36.596
he doesn't have time
to get to the yard work

11:36.596 --> 11:37.931
and the trash cans, so...

11:37.931 --> 11:39.833
he has to do it at night.

11:39.833 --> 11:43.036
Uh-huh. So,
what can I do for you?

11:44.371 --> 11:45.839
Oh. (clears throat softly)

11:45.839 --> 11:48.441
Well, uh, my back hurts,
uh, right here.

11:48.441 --> 11:51.478
I did something to it
in yoga two days ago.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.013
I've been taking yoga,

11:53.013 --> 11:57.184
because it's supposed
to be good for stress.

11:57.184 --> 11:59.853
Which I have.

11:59.853 --> 12:03.991
Do you want to ask me
why I'm stressed?

12:03.991 --> 12:07.227
Nope. I want to give you
a muscle relaxer.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.862
Are you mad at me?

12:08.862 --> 12:10.363
No, I'm not.
You are, huh?

12:10.363 --> 12:12.699
It's my fault.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.734
We were starting
to be so close,

12:14.734 --> 12:16.503
and then I totally
dropped you,

12:16.503 --> 12:17.871
and now that
I-I need...

12:17.871 --> 12:20.307
You can see Addy for the pills.
Have a nice night.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.743
SANDI: I'm still too weak

12:23.743 --> 12:24.912
to teach, Brick.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.679
I just about wore
out my neti pot

12:26.679 --> 12:29.883
trying to get over
this cold, but I still
haven't been able

12:29.883 --> 12:31.718
to open my yoga
studio all week.

12:31.718 --> 12:35.188
But I heard that someone
took a yoga class two days ago.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.891
Uh, but then I remembered

12:37.891 --> 12:40.027
that I'm not interested.
Never mind.

12:40.027 --> 12:44.364
Addy, w-would you take Sandi
in my exam room, please?

12:44.364 --> 12:45.632
Surely.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.367
(sighs)

12:47.367 --> 12:49.269
What is this nonsense?

12:49.269 --> 12:50.603
What do you mean?

12:50.603 --> 12:52.672
Addy said you're-you're
switching off or something?

12:52.672 --> 12:55.108
I mean, you're
not interested
in your patients?

12:55.108 --> 12:56.944
Oh, no, I'm interested
in what's wrong with them.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.478
No, no, no, we're
not rewinding

12:58.478 --> 12:59.446
this situation here.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.648
I mean, I spent
too much time and work

13:01.648 --> 13:02.916
making you into
a decent doctor

13:02.916 --> 13:04.617
for you to head
backwards on me now.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.754
I'm not. It's just that
I can be a better doctor

13:07.754 --> 13:09.322
if I don't get involved.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.458
No, you can't.
Of course you can't. You...
Really?

13:11.458 --> 13:13.927
Because everyone that
came in today was treated.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.528
They were seen in half

13:15.528 --> 13:16.663
the usual time.

13:16.663 --> 13:17.664
Best of all,

13:17.664 --> 13:18.866
no one died.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.267
So I'd call that
a pretty good day.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.469
Thank you for your
concern, Brick,

13:22.469 --> 13:24.004
but, really, I'm fine.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.539
(quietly): Okay.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.088
You didn't

13:41.088 --> 13:42.622
sound fine on the phone.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.557
(softly): Dad!

13:44.557 --> 13:47.027
(sighs)

13:54.301 --> 13:56.703
Hello? Anyone?

13:56.703 --> 13:57.905
Uh...

13:57.905 --> 14:00.974
Lemon?

14:02.309 --> 14:04.244
(clears throat)

14:04.244 --> 14:05.345
Um, hello.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.114
I can see you down there.
Sorry.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.316
I-I'm supposed
to be gone by now.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.217
Okay, Crickett,

14:10.217 --> 14:11.952
what is... all of this?

14:11.952 --> 14:13.253
I-I got a note

14:13.253 --> 14:16.056
that said: "To take a trip
to You-and-Me-Land,

14:16.056 --> 14:17.457
"find your way

14:17.457 --> 14:19.259
"to Mansion...

14:19.259 --> 14:21.561
Bree-land"?
Lemon asked me

14:21.561 --> 14:22.695
to do this. (groans)

14:22.695 --> 14:23.997
I ruined it.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.166
Um... okay.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.134
Uh...

14:27.134 --> 14:29.036
"The sweetest path
from you to me

14:29.036 --> 14:31.871
is through the treat that...
holds the key."

14:31.871 --> 14:32.872
Okay.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.807
(clears throat)
Oh. Right.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.043
It wouldn't fit.

14:36.043 --> 14:39.846
Do you have any idea
what this is a key to?

14:39.846 --> 14:41.514
A room at
the Whippoorwill Blossom Inn.

14:41.514 --> 14:44.251
It's why I was running behind.
I couldn't find anything

14:44.251 --> 14:45.585
to rhyme with Whippoorwill.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.487
We should get a Ritz.
Okay, Crickett, do you

14:47.487 --> 14:49.256
have any idea what
this is all about?

14:49.256 --> 14:50.290
No.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.625
But I don't mind;
I'm used to it.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.527
Okay.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.229
My friend Rose pulled
through just fine.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.764
It's embarrassing

14:57.764 --> 15:00.867
that you came all
this way for nothing.
You were upset.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.802
And with our history, uh,

15:02.802 --> 15:06.473
if there was something
I could do, then I
wanted to show up.

15:06.473 --> 15:07.907
Well, thank you.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.676
There was really
nothing to do.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.111
I just needed to talk.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.745
So, what was Brick
talking about?

15:12.745 --> 15:14.147
Why is he worried about you?

15:14.147 --> 15:15.882
Oh, it's nothing.
He says that

15:15.882 --> 15:19.386
I can't be a good GP
without getting involved
with my patients.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.388
So, you're not a GP,
you're a surgeon.

15:21.388 --> 15:25.092
No, I'm not a GP
 or a surgeon.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.626
I'm nothing.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.295
I don't belong here,

15:28.295 --> 15:30.530
but I have nowhere
else to go.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.733
All I ever wanted was to be
a freakin' surgeon like you.

15:33.733 --> 15:36.970
So that's why I'm
doing this GP crap,
because the chief said

15:36.970 --> 15:38.605
I can't get the
surgical fellowship

15:38.605 --> 15:39.906
without it,
which means

15:39.906 --> 15:41.008
getting involved.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.842
But the more I
get involved,

15:42.842 --> 15:44.911
the worse it is
for everyone.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.213
But...

15:46.213 --> 15:48.415
thank you... for coming...

15:48.415 --> 15:51.284
Dad, and thank you for
wanting to fix it, but...

15:51.284 --> 15:53.920
there's nothing
that you can do.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.123
I'm stuck.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.927
(door opens)

16:00.927 --> 16:02.262
(door closes)

16:03.363 --> 16:06.533
Oh. Um, you're h...
you're here early.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.801
You look nice.

16:08.801 --> 16:09.936
(chuckles)

16:09.936 --> 16:11.038
Surprise.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.406
(laughs)

16:13.406 --> 16:14.474
(laughs)

16:14.474 --> 16:15.642
Wow.

16:15.642 --> 16:20.213
Uh, Lemon, um,
this is really
romantic and all,

16:20.213 --> 16:23.450
but I thought that we agreed
that we were... gonna wait,

16:23.450 --> 16:25.918
you know, for our...
our wedding night.

16:25.918 --> 16:28.488
I know that we did, but...

16:28.488 --> 16:31.491
let's be honest, we're
not saving it to be romantic,

16:31.491 --> 16:33.593
we're saving it
because we're just afraid.

16:33.593 --> 16:36.196
You know, it's
a small town,

16:36.196 --> 16:39.232
and I don't like it
any more than you do that...

16:39.232 --> 16:40.867
there's a third person
between us,

16:40.867 --> 16:42.969
and I know that I put him there.

16:42.969 --> 16:44.971
But we can either
just pick up

16:44.971 --> 16:48.841
and leave town or just...
push through it.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.078
All right. All right.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.080
(mumbles)

16:53.080 --> 16:55.282
(sighs)

16:56.116 --> 16:58.118
Just push through it.
Yes.

16:58.118 --> 17:01.421
Just... just do it.
Mm-hmm.

17:01.421 --> 17:06.159
Just get the first one
out of the way, go to bed.
Like a waffle.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.596
Okay, I'm in.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.601
Um... how do we do that?

17:14.601 --> 17:17.436
Alcohol. Yeah.
Yeah. I'll call
the front desk.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.440
MAGNOLIA: Seriously,

17:20.440 --> 17:22.409
when I said I wished
Rose was dead,

17:22.409 --> 17:24.042
it was only
because she was

17:24.042 --> 17:25.178
going out with
Frederick Dean.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.646
I did not mean
 really die.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.013
Does God

17:28.013 --> 17:29.482
not get sarcasm?

17:29.482 --> 17:32.819
Anyway, I am so glad
she's not dead,

17:32.819 --> 17:35.288
and so if I
make it up to her

17:35.288 --> 17:37.124
in every possible way,
can you guarantee

17:37.124 --> 17:39.459
I will not go to hell?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.662
* *

17:46.466 --> 17:48.468
(soft gasp) What
you working on?

17:48.468 --> 17:51.003
Nothing!
Business proposal?

17:51.003 --> 17:53.039
Shh!

17:53.039 --> 17:54.107
(loudly): Business
proposal for what?

17:54.107 --> 17:55.675
Cut it out, okay?
Just cool it!

17:55.675 --> 17:56.709
(giggles)
Okay?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.879
(quietly):
I'm opening a bar.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.548
Oh... (laughs)

18:01.548 --> 18:02.449
Shut up.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.683
Okay? It's not a joke.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.252
It's not funny.
Got a meeting tomorrow

18:05.252 --> 18:06.986
with Peggy from the bank,
gonna get a loan.

18:06.986 --> 18:10.923
No one is loaning money for
new business in this economy.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.659
Certainly not
from no screw-up

18:12.659 --> 18:14.327
like Wade Kinsella.

18:14.327 --> 18:17.063
Yeah, well, you're wrong, hmm?

18:17.063 --> 18:19.566
Oh, look--
there's Peggy now.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.501
I'll just over-serve
her enough

18:21.501 --> 18:24.404
to impair her decision-
making ability.

18:27.407 --> 18:28.508
Hmm.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.343
This is some
damn good champagne.
Mm-hmm.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.245
I believe I've had...

18:32.245 --> 18:34.013
just the right amount.

18:34.013 --> 18:36.249
I think I have, too.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.884
Matter of fact...

18:37.884 --> 18:42.054
right now I submit that
sex is not only doable,

18:42.054 --> 18:43.823
but...

18:45.558 --> 18:47.727
I think it's a
damn good idea.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.263
(giggles)
I'll be right back.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.098
(grunts)

18:52.098 --> 18:53.433
Whoo!

18:54.667 --> 18:56.536
(giggles)

18:57.103 --> 18:58.538
(sighs)

19:02.108 --> 19:03.576
(grunts)

19:04.811 --> 19:07.580
(grunting)

19:07.580 --> 19:09.182
Okay.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.324
(groans, pants)

19:18.591 --> 19:19.926
George?

19:19.926 --> 19:22.329
TOM: People? People? Uh, uh,
(electronic feedback)

19:22.329 --> 19:23.963
everyone has their assignments
for the drill.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.699
It's important we all
do our job for this to work.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.268
To illustrate why,
our lovely Wanda

19:28.268 --> 19:30.370
will now sing
"For the Want of a Nail."

19:30.370 --> 19:33.440
Bring it on.
Give it up. Give it up!

19:34.274 --> 19:37.510
(lively pop intro plays)

19:37.510 --> 19:41.348
* For the want of a nail,
the shoe was lost *

19:41.348 --> 19:43.316
* For the want of the shoe *

19:43.316 --> 19:45.752
* The horse was lost,
for the want *

19:45.752 --> 19:48.621
* Of a horse,
the rider was lost *

19:48.621 --> 19:52.425
* For the want of the rider,
the message was lost *

19:52.425 --> 19:54.394
* For the want of nail *

19:54.394 --> 19:56.229
* The world was lost *

19:56.229 --> 19:58.431
* For the want of a nail *

19:58.431 --> 20:00.333
* The world was lost *

20:00.333 --> 20:02.969
* For the want of a nail *

20:02.969 --> 20:04.036
What's wrong?

20:04.036 --> 20:06.506
* The want of a nail *

20:06.506 --> 20:08.608
* Of a nail *

20:08.608 --> 20:11.844
* For the want of a rider,
the message was lost *

20:11.844 --> 20:14.781
* For the want of the message,
the battle was... *

20:14.781 --> 20:18.184
Okay, I know you don't like it
if I try to fix things.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.219
I'll work on it.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.421
But...

20:21.421 --> 20:23.323
I called Boston General.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.692
They'd offered me
a position on their staff,

20:25.692 --> 20:26.459
and...

20:26.459 --> 20:28.761
I said I'd take it

20:28.761 --> 20:31.664
if they gave you
a cardio-thoracic fellowship.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.933
What? Me?

20:33.933 --> 20:35.668
And they said yes.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.604
We could leave
here tomorrow.

20:37.604 --> 20:38.938
You wouldn't
have to stay

20:38.938 --> 20:40.373
in BlueBell another minute.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.346
* For the want of a nail *

20:46.346 --> 20:48.615
* The world was lost *

20:48.615 --> 20:49.816
* For the want of a nail... *

20:49.816 --> 20:51.718
I'll take it.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.354
* The want of a nail... *

20:58.825 --> 21:00.560
(knocking)

21:00.560 --> 21:02.662
Hello.

21:02.662 --> 21:03.930
Hi.

21:05.298 --> 21:07.300
Going somewhere?

21:07.300 --> 21:08.668
Boston.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.703
Gonna visit a
friend or something?

21:10.703 --> 21:11.704
No.

21:11.704 --> 21:15.041
I got a
cardio-thoracic
fellowship.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.049
So you're just gonna
leave in the night?

21:24.083 --> 21:26.285
In the morning.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.556
Without saying good-bye?

21:30.890 --> 21:31.924
Yeah.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.460
Everyone's mad
at me, anyway--

21:33.460 --> 21:35.428
who am I going
to say good-bye to?

21:35.428 --> 21:36.796
Wade hates me.
George chose Lemon.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.931
He'd be glad to see I'm gone.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.334
I tried to kill Rose.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.336
You're mad at me.

21:43.336 --> 21:45.372
Coming here caused enough drama;

21:45.372 --> 21:48.074
I don't need to make
a big exit, too.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.310
Uh, first of all, um...

21:51.310 --> 21:54.481
you and me...
we had an argument.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.950
We didn't break up.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.952
And second,

21:59.952 --> 22:03.055
even if you think you-you were
just passing through this place,

22:03.055 --> 22:05.958
you made a difference

22:05.958 --> 22:08.361
in lives.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.930
Here.

22:10.930 --> 22:14.266
You duck out of people
without saying good-bye?

22:14.266 --> 22:16.002
People like me

22:16.002 --> 22:19.606
and Rose.

22:19.606 --> 22:22.809
It's like saying
this didn't happen.

22:33.219 --> 22:35.655
I'll do it.

22:35.655 --> 22:38.057
In the morning, I promise.

22:59.779 --> 23:01.180
Peggy.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.249
We haven't been formally
introduced yet.

23:03.249 --> 23:04.551
Wade.

23:04.551 --> 23:07.554
Uh, we have a meeting
tomorrow about the loan.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.589
Yes, hi. I know who you are.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.691
Well, you can't believe
everything you hear.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.526
No, seriously, you can't.

23:13.526 --> 23:14.694
Especially if it's bad.

23:14.694 --> 23:17.129
But it might all be good.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.531
(chuckles)
Probably not.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.500
Let's not kid ourselves.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.570
You know, some people tell you,
they'll tell you I'm a screw up.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.338
And-and, heck, I've had
my share of indiscretions

23:26.338 --> 23:27.574
behind me, right?

23:27.574 --> 23:28.908
Who hasn't?

23:28.908 --> 23:30.943
People change.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.745
You were young once.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.013
Right? Wh...
(clears throat)

23:34.013 --> 23:35.181
You're young now.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.850
What I mean is
that-that you

23:37.850 --> 23:40.219
probably came back to class
with your skirt on backwards

23:40.219 --> 23:41.454
a time or two, right, huh?

23:41.454 --> 23:43.523
Am I right? No?

23:44.857 --> 23:47.494
Peggy, (clears throat)
what I'm trying to say is,

23:47.494 --> 23:50.730
uh, if you give me that money,

23:50.730 --> 23:52.532
I won't cause trouble.

23:53.199 --> 23:54.333
I won't...

23:54.333 --> 23:56.135
I won't get into trouble.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.638
See, I realize that sounded
like a threat.
Okay, well,

23:58.638 --> 23:59.772
I should be getting home now.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.140
No, no, no, no, no, look.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.610
I think we got off on the
wrong foot a little bit.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.144
So, why don't you...
why don't you stay here.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.979
I'll grab you another drink,
and we can make out...

24:06.979 --> 24:09.215
Hang out, hang out, hang out.
Okay, you know what?

24:09.215 --> 24:11.083
Good night now.

24:13.686 --> 24:16.656
All right,
I-I'll see you tomorrow.

24:16.656 --> 24:17.857
Just gonna pull these apart.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.458
And just squeeze your-your head.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.627
Ow!

24:20.627 --> 24:22.629
Stop, stop, okay?
Come on.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.130
Ow, ow, stop.

24:24.130 --> 24:27.399
I think you've been pulling
on my head long enough,

24:27.399 --> 24:30.236
and I think it's safe to say
that that's not the answer.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.104
(grunting):
Geez!

24:32.104 --> 24:33.339
You're right.

24:33.339 --> 24:34.974
You're right, okay.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.408
Here.

24:36.408 --> 24:39.846
We need to make it slick.

24:39.846 --> 24:42.749
I'll just go buy
some olive oil or something.

24:42.749 --> 24:44.016
No, no, no, no, no!

24:44.016 --> 24:45.785
You can't leave me here,
stuck like this.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.787
What if you end up
in a car accident,

24:47.787 --> 24:49.488
end then you get into a coma,

24:49.488 --> 24:52.925
and then you can't tell
anyone that I'm stuck here?

24:52.925 --> 24:55.928
And you being stuck here is the
only bad part of that scenario?

24:55.928 --> 24:58.064
Okay, what about whipped
cream, would that work?
Yeah, I guess,

24:58.064 --> 25:00.199
but where am I gonna
get whipped cream?

25:01.233 --> 25:04.203
Um, in my overnight bag?

25:04.203 --> 25:07.339
Why in the world you got
whipped cream in your....

25:07.339 --> 25:09.208
Oh.

25:13.345 --> 25:16.649
Thank you so much for all
you did for me today, Magnolia.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.985
Getting me these
chocolates and the pizzas

25:18.985 --> 25:20.787
and all these
stuffed animals.

25:20.787 --> 25:23.389
And my favorite pink sweater.

25:23.389 --> 25:24.490
Love it.

25:24.490 --> 25:25.658
You are such a good friend.

25:25.658 --> 25:27.560
Oh, I try.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.128
So, there's nothing else,
right?

25:29.128 --> 25:30.697
Uh, no, but tomorrow...

25:30.697 --> 25:32.865
Tomorrow?
Yeah.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.868
You know, I am so craving
an ice cream cake,

25:35.868 --> 25:37.436
but not the kind you get
at an ice cream store.

25:37.436 --> 25:39.572
WANDA: Tom!

25:39.572 --> 25:42.975
Maybe it's me mysteriously
almost dying,

25:42.975 --> 25:44.977
but I can't help but want

25:44.977 --> 25:46.613
that delicious taste
of homemade.

25:46.613 --> 25:48.314
(chuckles)

25:51.317 --> 25:54.220
ZOE: I promised to say good-bye
to everyone.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.056
So, where were we?

25:57.056 --> 25:58.090
Oh, right, yeah.

25:58.090 --> 26:01.193
You wanted me to follow
in your footsteps.

26:01.193 --> 26:02.528
Oops.

26:02.528 --> 26:05.331
A little update:
didn't go so great.

26:05.331 --> 26:08.167
Sorry.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.369
But for the record,

26:10.369 --> 26:12.504
I didn't want any of this.

26:12.504 --> 26:14.573
I'm sorry that you're dead,

26:14.573 --> 26:16.142
but this is all on you.

26:16.142 --> 26:19.812
Coming here was supposed
to make me a better doctor.

26:22.348 --> 26:25.351
But it just made things worse.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.823
I'm in love with someone
who's marrying someone else.

26:32.925 --> 26:37.029
I hurt someone
who has feelings for me.

26:37.029 --> 26:40.032
And Rose...

26:42.635 --> 26:46.372
How can I ever...

26:46.372 --> 26:49.175
(sighs)

26:49.175 --> 26:51.477
But hey,

26:51.477 --> 26:54.613
first do no harm, right?

26:54.613 --> 26:58.250
So, that's why
I'm going somewhere

26:58.250 --> 27:01.654
where I can never hurt anyone
ever again.

27:04.256 --> 27:08.127
So long.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.295
(phone ringing)

27:15.668 --> 27:17.870
(sighs)

27:21.573 --> 27:23.776
(air raid siren wailing)

27:31.684 --> 27:33.019
Oh.
Drill.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.421
Oh! Oh! I need to be there;
I got important...

27:35.421 --> 27:36.422
Wait, what, what?

27:36.422 --> 27:37.489
Are you seriously thinking

27:37.489 --> 27:39.325
of leaving this actual emergency

27:39.325 --> 27:40.559
to go to a fake emergency?

27:40.559 --> 27:42.061
I swear to God, George,

27:42.061 --> 27:43.830
if you leave me here,
this whole town can practice

27:43.830 --> 27:45.698
what to do if a woman
chews off her own head!

27:45.698 --> 27:46.733
Right, right.

27:46.733 --> 27:47.934
(sighs)
Yeah.

27:47.934 --> 27:48.968
DASH:
Storm emergency!

27:48.968 --> 27:50.236
House-to-house search!

27:50.236 --> 27:51.303
Is anybody in here?

27:51.303 --> 27:52.071
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.439
Wait, wait, wait.
No! No!

27:54.273 --> 27:55.574
Wait!

27:55.574 --> 27:57.710
Oh.

27:59.712 --> 28:01.313
Uh, sorry.

28:01.313 --> 28:07.319
Nice peignoir.

28:07.319 --> 28:09.789
Has anyone seen Tom Long?

28:09.789 --> 28:11.157
(gasps)
Tom!

28:14.526 --> 28:16.729
Tom, you're supposed
to be the drill captain.

28:16.729 --> 28:18.397
You're not listed as being hurt.

28:18.397 --> 28:20.800
I'm afraid disaster knows
no script.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.101
Doctor!

28:22.101 --> 28:24.203
We need a doctor over here!

28:24.203 --> 28:26.906
Yeah, well, I could
 use one over here, too,

28:26.906 --> 28:30.843
but I haven't seen
our Dr. Hart in hours.

28:30.843 --> 28:34.046
I don't think she's coming.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.118
Thank you for arranging
a flight tonight.

28:39.118 --> 28:39.986
No problem.

28:39.986 --> 28:41.788
Why wait till morning, right?

28:45.024 --> 28:48.227
Did you say all your good-byes?

29:01.573 --> 29:03.442
I did.

29:19.391 --> 29:20.793
(phone chirps)

29:22.728 --> 29:24.964
(sighs)

29:24.964 --> 29:27.934
Hey, you did the right thing,
leaving right away.

29:27.934 --> 29:30.502
Better for everyone
not to drag it out.

29:32.438 --> 29:33.806
I know.

29:33.806 --> 29:38.444
I just keep thinking about
 How the Grinch Stole Christmas.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.812
All the Whos in Whoville,

29:39.812 --> 29:42.148
they wake up
with Christmas just gone.

29:42.148 --> 29:45.017
Cindy Lou Who standing there
all confused.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.486
Then they sang and
they were fine.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.188
(sighs)
I guess.

29:49.188 --> 29:52.558
It's like an infection
down here, you know?

29:52.558 --> 29:54.861
Caring... sucks.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.628
You're not the Grinch,

29:56.628 --> 29:58.630
and you don't want
to be a GP,

29:58.630 --> 30:00.132
you want to be a surgeon,

30:00.132 --> 30:02.434
and detaching is how
you become a great one.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.703
That's why they
curtain off everything

30:04.703 --> 30:05.972
but the area
you're gonna cut.

30:05.972 --> 30:08.774
No person, just a
problem to fix.

30:08.774 --> 30:10.977
I know, right?

30:10.977 --> 30:12.845
You don't have
to know their grandma

30:12.845 --> 30:15.314
or go to their birthday party

30:15.314 --> 30:16.916
or hear
about their fake yoga class.

30:16.916 --> 30:19.085
Sounds great.

30:24.056 --> 30:25.757
I ran into Peggy

30:25.757 --> 30:27.860
over at the water
purifying station.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.862
Where in our plan

30:29.862 --> 30:31.931
did it say Wade hits
on the loan officer?

30:31.931 --> 30:32.932
I didn't hit on her.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.200
All right, look,

30:34.200 --> 30:35.834
I got tongue-tied,
and then it just...

30:35.834 --> 30:37.203
It came out wrong.

30:37.203 --> 30:38.971
I'll fix it before
the meeting tomorrow, okay?

30:38.971 --> 30:39.939
I'll fix it.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.941
What meeting? She canceled.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.075
Said you
might not be ready

30:43.075 --> 30:45.677
for the responsibility
of a business.

30:45.677 --> 30:46.946
After one screw up?

30:48.347 --> 30:50.950
See, that just shows she wasn't
gonna give me a loan anyway.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.318
Of course not!

30:52.318 --> 30:55.821
Which is why I was going along
to cosign the loan.

30:55.821 --> 30:57.924
You were?

30:57.924 --> 31:00.059
I was gonna vouch for you.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.528
I was gonna say

31:02.528 --> 31:05.497
you changed.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.070
(sighs)

31:16.976 --> 31:18.710
ETHAN:
Still delayed.

31:18.710 --> 31:19.946
Don't know how long.

31:19.946 --> 31:21.247
I'm sorry.

31:21.247 --> 31:23.515
I know you had better
things to do than this.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.251
Oh, not at all.

31:25.251 --> 31:26.752
I don't even mind
airports anymore.

31:26.752 --> 31:29.321
I got so used to them when
your mom and I split up.

31:29.321 --> 31:31.357
Why?

31:31.357 --> 31:32.391
(sighs)

31:32.391 --> 31:35.394
Every time she had a
function or an event,

31:35.394 --> 31:37.729
or something, I had
to fly back for it

31:37.729 --> 31:39.065
to keep up the front

31:39.065 --> 31:40.832
that our marriage
was still fine.

31:40.832 --> 31:42.601
That we were still
the perfect couple.

31:42.601 --> 31:45.004
She didn't tell people
that you split up?

31:45.004 --> 31:47.706
No, not for a long time.

31:47.706 --> 31:49.108
(chuckles)

31:49.108 --> 31:52.311
I think she thought
it would reflect badly on her.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.113
What she put herself through,

31:54.113 --> 31:55.982
keeping up all those lies.

31:55.982 --> 31:59.218
Oh, damn it.

31:59.218 --> 32:00.519
Dad?

32:00.519 --> 32:02.721
I'm going to be
a great surgeon.

32:02.721 --> 32:05.124
But you know that infection

32:05.124 --> 32:07.159
I was talking about?

32:07.159 --> 32:09.728
The caring and all?

32:09.728 --> 32:12.198
I'm sorry, but first,

32:12.198 --> 32:15.367
I have to clear up
one more case.

32:15.367 --> 32:16.402
Be right back.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.104
You wanted to see me
this time of night.

32:18.104 --> 32:19.371
I got worried.

32:19.371 --> 32:23.609
I was talking to my dad
about something sad.

32:23.609 --> 32:28.047
My mom was so embarrassed
when he left her,

32:28.047 --> 32:30.249
that she pretended
that they were still together

32:30.249 --> 32:33.319
for a long time afterward.

32:33.319 --> 32:36.522
I thought about how hard she had
to work to put on a front.

32:38.624 --> 32:41.460
She lived in New York City,

32:41.460 --> 32:45.264
but if not, I can imagine
all kinds of things

32:45.264 --> 32:49.201
that she might have been doing

32:49.201 --> 32:52.204
like mowing the lawn
in the middle of the night.

32:52.204 --> 32:56.308
Keeping her old-lady
neighbor awake.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.478
She must have been
hurting so much,

32:59.478 --> 33:02.081
and to not be able
to tell anyone...

33:02.081 --> 33:05.517
Hmm, that does
sound hard.

33:07.286 --> 33:09.488
How long has he been gone?

33:10.589 --> 33:12.591
Three months.

33:12.591 --> 33:15.061
His new job
took him

33:15.061 --> 33:17.829
to Baton Rouge
some weeks.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.032
He met a waitress there.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.035
Says they're in love.

33:23.869 --> 33:25.971
He's not coming back.

33:25.971 --> 33:28.674
I'm sorry.

33:29.875 --> 33:32.544
But, AnnaBeth, you can't
keep hiding the truth

33:32.544 --> 33:34.346
from the town.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.548
If nothing else,
your back won't take it.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.550
(chuckles)

33:42.221 --> 33:44.590
You have
to tell people.

33:44.590 --> 33:48.260
That's the whole point
of small towns, right?

33:48.260 --> 33:50.862
Everyone cares.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.731
(sighs)

33:52.731 --> 33:54.266
Thank you, Zoe.

34:03.975 --> 34:06.178
(sighs)

34:09.014 --> 34:11.882
You believe that?

34:11.882 --> 34:13.418
Then why the hell
are you leaving?

34:14.453 --> 34:16.455
(sighs)

34:23.362 --> 34:25.563
ZOE: How did you find out?

34:25.563 --> 34:27.266
Small town.

34:27.966 --> 34:29.335
Lavon.

34:30.702 --> 34:32.904
Don't think I haven't
dreamed about this day

34:32.904 --> 34:35.474
for most of
last year,

34:35.474 --> 34:38.076
but I do think I should
at least get to know why.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.346
I'm not a GP, that's all.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.348
I heard you in here
with AnnaBeth.

34:42.348 --> 34:44.216
That was being
an excellent GP.

34:44.216 --> 34:46.083
Yeah, well, I just
can't do it anymore.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.320
Do what?
Care.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.157
Look, Zoe, I know
you blame yourself

34:51.157 --> 34:52.358
for what happened
to Rose.

34:52.358 --> 34:54.493
I just-- I can't do it,
Brick, okay?

34:54.493 --> 34:56.094
I can't take
that chance again.
What, chance

34:56.094 --> 34:58.029
of someone getting sick?
Someone that I know,

34:58.029 --> 35:01.467
someone
that I care about.

35:01.467 --> 35:04.236
I was more scared than I've
ever been in my whole life.

35:04.236 --> 35:07.239
GPs feel that way
all of the time.

35:07.239 --> 35:10.242
It hurts too much.

35:10.242 --> 35:14.313
I just can't live
that way, I'm sorry.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.449
Yeah, me, too.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.320
You know it's
called being human?

35:22.988 --> 35:26.192
Zoe, people get
sick and they die,

35:26.192 --> 35:30.596
but they're also born and they
learn to ride a bike and...

35:30.596 --> 35:31.797
fall in love.

35:31.797 --> 35:34.533
You can shut yourself
off from all that

35:34.533 --> 35:38.504
if you want to-- I mean,
that's your choice--

35:38.504 --> 35:41.139
but don't call that living.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.619
Oh, God, you nearly
scared me half to death

35:53.619 --> 35:54.953
with that hacksaw
of yours.

35:54.953 --> 35:57.223
I thought for sure I was
going to be decapitated.

35:57.223 --> 36:00.025
Yeah, well, I'm just glad
I found one.

36:00.025 --> 36:01.493
(gasps) Oh, my God.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.261
What?

36:03.862 --> 36:05.864
I forgot my underwear.

36:07.699 --> 36:10.202
You're not wearing
any underwear right now?
Shh!

36:10.202 --> 36:12.471
No, George, we ran
out of there so quick.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.308
Well, shoot,
now I can't concentrate.

36:16.308 --> 36:18.877
(both laugh)

36:18.877 --> 36:20.679
It's kind of like
our first time, remember?

36:20.679 --> 36:21.580
Yes.

36:21.580 --> 36:23.114
I asked you
if you wore underwear

36:23.114 --> 36:24.450
under those cheerleader
underpants

36:24.450 --> 36:26.685
or if they were
the underwear.

36:26.685 --> 36:27.986
(giggles)

36:27.986 --> 36:31.857
And at the JV football game,
I took you under the bleachers

36:31.857 --> 36:34.460
to show you just to, you know,
put your mind at rest.

36:34.460 --> 36:36.462
And it did not do that.

36:37.729 --> 36:41.199
And I remember being late
to the varsity game that night

36:41.199 --> 36:42.801
and missing three more
later that season.

36:42.801 --> 36:44.503
Remember that one time
that your foot nudged

36:44.503 --> 36:46.137
the, uh,
the homecoming

36:46.137 --> 36:48.073
halftime fireworks display,

36:48.073 --> 36:49.308
and when they
finally went off,

36:49.308 --> 36:50.476
they were all aimed
at the...

36:50.476 --> 36:51.477
BOTH: Water tower?

36:51.477 --> 36:53.345
(laughs)
(clears throat)

36:53.345 --> 36:54.680
Nobody ever knew.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.114
(sighs)

36:56.114 --> 36:58.317
No one ever did.

37:03.622 --> 37:08.260
Baby... you know, all those
memories-- they're just ours.

37:08.260 --> 37:10.496
Nobody

37:10.496 --> 37:12.698
can take them away from us...

37:13.632 --> 37:15.834
...not unless we let them.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.311
Plane left.

37:25.311 --> 37:26.645
I know, I'm sorry.

37:26.645 --> 37:29.247
The hell of it will be
getting your luggage back.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.616
Lot of paperwork.

37:31.450 --> 37:34.420
Dad... I'm staying.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.355
You're sure?

37:37.423 --> 37:40.959
I might be a better surgeon
somewhere else,

37:40.959 --> 37:43.795
but I'll be a better person
in BlueBell.

37:43.795 --> 37:47.666
Well, as a surgeon, I
have to tell you, it's...

37:47.666 --> 37:49.200
it's career suicide.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.269
I know.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.572
But as your father...

37:54.540 --> 37:57.343
I'm proud of you.

38:14.760 --> 38:17.896
(sighs)

38:17.896 --> 38:19.465
Morning.

38:24.336 --> 38:27.439
Look, uh...

38:27.439 --> 38:29.608
I just wanted
to apologize

38:29.608 --> 38:31.477
for screwing up
the meeting yesterday.

38:31.477 --> 38:34.045
I appreciate

38:34.045 --> 38:39.418
your faith in me,
however misplaced it might be.

38:44.790 --> 38:46.792
Not misplaced.

38:46.792 --> 38:48.093
No, I prefer

38:48.093 --> 38:52.197
to think of it
as premature.

38:52.197 --> 38:53.399
Yeah.

38:53.399 --> 38:54.666
As in, not yet mature.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.602
Huh.

38:56.602 --> 38:58.604
Well, fair enough.

38:58.604 --> 39:00.672
All in good time
then, right?

39:00.672 --> 39:03.074
I can't wait till Zoe Hart
hears about this.

39:03.074 --> 39:04.810
She just loves
a good story

39:04.810 --> 39:06.545
where I make a fool
out of myself.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.113
Oh, you don't know.

39:08.113 --> 39:09.681
Wade, uh...

39:12.150 --> 39:14.152
Zoe's gone.

39:14.152 --> 39:16.221
(chuckles)

39:16.221 --> 39:17.856
Gone how?

39:17.856 --> 39:19.558
Moved away

39:19.558 --> 39:22.561
during the night.

39:25.964 --> 39:27.966
Oh.

39:27.966 --> 39:30.669
Well...

39:31.503 --> 39:33.905
Good, then, huh?

39:33.905 --> 39:35.040
About time.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.942
Yeah, you know what?
All that stuff abou-about me

39:36.942 --> 39:41.379
"improving myself,"
about trying to open a bar--

39:41.379 --> 39:45.617
that was all her
anyway, so, uh...

39:45.617 --> 39:47.318
Yeah, yeah, you know what?

39:47.318 --> 39:50.188
I think life just got a whole
lot easier around here.

39:50.188 --> 39:51.457
(door opens)

39:51.457 --> 39:53.625
Morning.

39:54.793 --> 39:56.495
Hey.

39:56.495 --> 39:59.330
So, uh, you decided to say
good-bye after all, huh?

39:59.330 --> 40:03.001
Oh, no, I-I'm not great with
good-byes, so I decided to stay.

40:06.137 --> 40:08.440
I thought...

40:08.440 --> 40:10.876
I-I thought you s...

40:22.420 --> 40:24.623
CRICKETT:
 So, how was last night?

40:24.623 --> 40:27.392
Last night was...

40:27.392 --> 40:29.094
(giggles)

40:29.094 --> 40:32.230
Goodness, you certainly
do love tennis.

40:32.230 --> 40:34.432
LEMON: Yes, I do.

40:35.366 --> 40:37.368
AnnaBeth,

40:37.368 --> 40:38.637
is something wrong?

40:39.705 --> 40:41.707
Well, don't just stand there.

40:41.707 --> 40:43.642
You look like a public statue
honoring

40:43.642 --> 40:44.976
the confused.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.579
I have something
to tell you guys.

40:47.579 --> 40:49.781
It's about my marriage.

40:55.987 --> 40:56.988
Hi.

40:56.988 --> 40:58.056
Zoe, oh, my God,

40:58.056 --> 40:59.057
there you are.

40:59.057 --> 41:00.358
MAGNOLIA:
Rose, I will be right outside

41:00.358 --> 41:02.561
if you need anything.
Okay.

41:03.394 --> 41:05.597
(sighs)

41:06.665 --> 41:08.667
Okay, what was that?

41:08.667 --> 41:11.369
Oh, nothing,
Magnolia is my servant.

41:11.369 --> 41:12.571
Nice.
So, where have you been?

41:12.571 --> 41:14.205
I've got so much
to tell you.

41:14.205 --> 41:16.074
I know, I-I'm sorry.

41:16.074 --> 41:18.276
I should have come,
but I was so scared.

41:18.276 --> 41:21.112
I just needed time to understand
the right thing to do.

41:21.112 --> 41:22.548
Doctors get scared?

41:22.548 --> 41:24.049
That's what I hear.

41:24.049 --> 41:24.816
Yeah.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.251
What did you want to tell me?

41:26.251 --> 41:27.819
Okay, ready?
Yeah.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.988
Frederick Dean kissed me.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.322
What?!
(laughs)

41:31.322 --> 41:32.624
Oh... my God.

41:32.624 --> 41:33.859
Okay, wait, you have to
tell me every second,

41:33.859 --> 41:35.226
do not miss
a thing.

41:35.226 --> 41:36.695
Okay, but if you're going
to stay for a while,

41:36.695 --> 41:38.229
let me get you some tea.

41:38.229 --> 41:39.865
Magnolia!

41:39.865 --> 41:42.400
(laughter
and excited chatter)

41:42.400 --> 41:46.805
