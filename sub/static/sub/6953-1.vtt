{y:i}Leaving British authorities still baffled ...

06:46.656 --> 06:50.160
{y:i}and without any substantial clues
{y:i}nine months after the theft.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.787
{y:i}The Bluestone was one of 19...

06:52.912 --> 06:55.290

06:55.457 --> 06:59.919
{y:i}It weighs more than fiive tons, making
{y:i}its disappearance a mystery indeed.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.214
{y:i}Derrick Smith ... at Stonehenge.

07:05.216 --> 07:09.137
{Y:i}When we come back,
Trina will be here to tell you what you can do

07:33.411 --> 07:36.498
{y:i}That's right, three horrifiic masks
{y:i}to choose from.

07:36.623 --> 07:40.585
{y:i}They're fun, they're frightening,
{y:i}and they glow in the dark.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.526
They're coming.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.113
They're coming.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.175
Anybody home?

09:19.225 --> 09:20.226
Hello?

09:20.351 --> 09:23.730
Daddy's here.
Yea!

09:23.855 --> 09:25.732
Oh, hey.
Oh, Daddy!

09:25.857 --> 09:27.734
Daddy's here!

09:27.859 --> 09:31.738
Daddy! Children, we leave
our food at the table.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.407
Oh, I'm sorry, it's bad
timing. I'm used to it.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.409
What'd you bring us?
Well, wait.

09:36.534 --> 09:39.412
This, uh... One for you.
One for you.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.878
What's the matter?
Don't you like them?

09:47.003 --> 09:48.963
Mom already got us masks.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.965
Silver Shamrock.
Look!

09:53.551 --> 09:54.469
Nice try.

09:54.594 --> 09:59.057
* Eight more days to Halloween, halloween, halloween *

09:59.182 --> 10:00.058
So ...

10:00.350 --> 10:01.309
how you've been?

10:04.938 --> 10:06.064
I gotta call in.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.609
Drinking and doctor. Great combination.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.611
Let's watch TV.
Okay.

10:19.494 --> 10:22.997
{y:i}* Eight more days to Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
Turn that down.

10:23.248 --> 10:26.960
{y:i}* Eight more days to Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *

10:27.877 --> 10:28.712
When?

10:30.672 --> 10:32.173
What's his condition?

10:33.550 --> 10:36.511
All right, I'll be right in.
I gotta go.

10:36.636 --> 10:40.015
His condition is stable,
but Dr. Castle had to leave early.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.809
So I thought I should call
you. Sure, sure. That's fiine.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.815
He just walked up
outta the rain.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.568
I swear to God
that's all there was to it.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.154
I just brought him here.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.158
Do you have a room for him? Yes, 13.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.999
Hey, can I leave now?
Sure. I don't see why not.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.543
Thanks a lot for bringing him.
- Well, thank you, Doc.

11:08.668 --> 11:12.005
I was always taught that when somebody
needs help, you help 'em.

11:12.130 --> 11:15.842
I mean less there's gonna be trouble.
There's not gonna be any trouble, in it.

11:15.967 --> 11:19.220
I mean you never know,
when somebody might be needing help.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.015
It might be my turn next time.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.353
They're going to kill us.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.273
All of us.

11:30.398 --> 11:33.193
All of us.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.070
Hundred milligrams,
Thorazine. 

11:35.612 --> 11:36.905
I.V.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.297
Who's next?

11:54.839 --> 11:56.257
Nobody.

11:58.009 --> 12:00.303
Except for him, it's a quiet night. 

12:00.428 --> 12:01.805
I could use a nap.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.640
Doctor's lounge is empty.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.767
Wanna take one with me?

12:07.727 --> 12:11.564
Pillows are in the cabinet and
there's milk and cookies in the fridge.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.858
I think I should have
married you, Agnes.

12:14.693 --> 12:19.072
Ooh! Watch it. I play
for keeps, you know. I'm serious.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.766
What are you doing
in here?

15:13.705 --> 15:14.789
A man...

15:14.914 --> 15:16.708
A man just, just...

15:18.126 --> 15:19.502
A man just... He just...

15:19.627 --> 15:21.338
All right, all right.

15:40.231 --> 15:41.608
Hey!

16:25.694 --> 16:27.195
Hello, Linda. Dan.

16:27.320 --> 16:31.616
I won't be able to pick the kids up tonight something ...
{y:i}- Damn it, you promised me.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.452
My ex-wife.

16:38.206 --> 16:40.417
No, no, Linda, it's nothing
like that at all.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.836
If you'd just relax for a minute,
{y:i}- I... I am relaxed.

16:42.961 --> 16:45.922
Two men died here tonight.

16:46.047 --> 16:48.967
No, it wasn't an accident.

16:50.218 --> 16:52.846
Listen, I'll tell you
all about it later, all right?

16:52.971 --> 16:55.056
I really gotta go.
{y:i}- Dan, you promised.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.017
Sure. Sure. Saturday
night. That'd be fine.

16:57.142 --> 16:58.768
They can both stay with me all night.

16:59.185 --> 16:59.769
{y:i}Great.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.312
Tell them I'm sorry.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.607
{y:i}10:00 a.m., Saturday. Please.

17:04.733 --> 17:07.444
I really gotta go.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.069
Bye.
{y:i}- Bye.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.079
{Y:i}If you would like
to make a call,

17:18.204 --> 17:20.665
{Y:i}please hang up
and try again.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.259
Is this my father?

18:13.385 --> 18:15.011
Ma'am, I wouldn't.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.305
Not yet.
- Let's get it over with.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.108
Yes, that's my father.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.362
What happened?

18:32.487 --> 18:34.114
Oh, some crazy man.

18:34.239 --> 18:37.909
Killed himself in the parking lot right after.
Drugs probably.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.328
Is that it? My father's
dead because of some crazy...

18:40.453 --> 18:43.039
The whole thing is under investigation. 

18:43.540 --> 18:44.666
I'll bet.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.043
You've had a hard night,
and you've come a long way.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.462
When you feel better,
I'll have some questions.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.756
And maybe some more answers.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.396
{Y:i}Dr. Rusfield, call admitting.

19:06.688 --> 19:09.524
{Y:i}Dr. Rusfield, call admitting.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.393
Look, Challis,
I'm only the assistant.

19:45.518 --> 19:49.230
Just tell me what you know, Teddy.
Not much. It's taking a while.

19:49.356 --> 19:52.025
The guy was a pile of ashes.
I know the sheriff thinks he was on drugs.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.569
That doesn't make any sense.
I've seen lots of people on drugs and ...

19:54.694 --> 19:57.530
The man was in complete control.
He looked like a businessman.

19:57.656 --> 20:00.241
He had to be one strong
businessman. I can tell you that.

20:00.367 --> 20:04.496
You don't pull someone's skull apart
without a little lower arm strength. Know, what I mean?

20:04.621 --> 20:07.749
Teddy ... just do me this one favor.
Check this one out yourself.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.125
Now, I can't do that.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.086
It's gotta go through...
- Please.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.088
This thing's really got you.

20:13.213 --> 20:16.883
I've been with that hospital for eight
years. Somebody just doesn't walk in...

20:21.221 --> 20:23.598
I'll see what I can do.
No promises.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.642
Thanks. Thanks.

20:25.892 --> 20:29.270
I was always good at moonlighting, wasn't I?
- Oh, the best.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.941
Do you still have
that... You do? - Uh-huh.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.318
How you been?
- Okay. You? - Okay.

20:35.443 --> 20:39.823
Sierra Mesa still making you drink your ass off?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

20:41.282 --> 20:42.659
Thanks again.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.621
Hey, you gonna be all right?

21:14.691 --> 21:17.110
Hey, Charlie, can we have another station?

21:17.235 --> 21:18.361
You got it.

21:22.699 --> 21:23.908
{y:i}The immortal classic,

21:24.034 --> 21:26.453
{y:i}followed by the big giveaway at 9:00,

21:26.578 --> 21:28.246
{y:i}brought to you by...

21:31.666 --> 21:34.961
{y:i}* Two more days to Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
- Oh Come on, come on. Come on.

21:35.503 --> 21:38.548
What's the matter?
Don't you have any Halloween spirit?

21:38.673 --> 21:39.507
No.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.608
Hi.
- Hello.

21:57.108 --> 21:58.318
My name is Ellie Grimbridge.

21:58.443 --> 21:59.361
I know. 

21:59.486 --> 22:01.029
Dan Challis.
- I know.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.573
One of the nurses told me, I could find you here.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.826
I saw you at the funeral.
Thank you.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.537
I'm sorry about your father.

22:12.499 --> 22:15.293
Did my father say anything
to you the night he died?

22:17.128 --> 22:18.630
Yeah. He, uh ...

22:19.339 --> 22:20.173
Yeah.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.134
He said,
"Tell Ellie I love her."

22:25.220 --> 22:26.221
Well ...

22:26.596 --> 22:28.264
you're a bad liar, but ... 

22:28.556 --> 22:31.059
thank you anyway.
- Wait a second.

22:34.145 --> 22:36.064
I saw something that night.

22:36.690 --> 22:39.234
I don't know.
Your father came into the hospital. He ...

22:39.359 --> 22:43.446
I thought he was crazy, out of his mind.
He's hangin' on to a Halloween mask. He wouldn't let it go.

22:43.571 --> 22:46.908
And what he said was...
"They're gonna kill us all."

22:47.033 --> 22:49.160
And in a little while, he was dead.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.996
And I don't know
what the hell is goin' on.

23:00.755 --> 23:03.008
Papa really loved this place ...

23:03.591 --> 23:05.468
But business was getting bad.

23:06.177 --> 23:09.556
I suppose you shopped at the new
mall like everybody else, huh?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.767
The kids were keeping him going.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.519
They'd come in after school.

23:14.644 --> 23:18.064
He'd let 'em play with stuff right in the
aisles like I used to when I was little.

23:18.815 --> 23:22.193
The question is, why would
anybody wanna kill Papa?

23:22.485 --> 23:24.696
He was a wonderful man.
He...

23:27.157 --> 23:29.367
I've been doing some detective work.

23:30.827 --> 23:33.079
My father kept excellent records.

23:33.788 --> 23:37.876
"October 18: Merchants council
meeting." He was there. I checked.

23:38.001 --> 23:40.962
"October 19: Football game."
He was there too.

23:41.087 --> 23:44.466
"October 20:
Pick up more masks."

23:46.051 --> 23:46.926
Yeah.

23:47.218 --> 23:49.471
That's the kind your father had in his hand.

23:49.846 --> 23:52.265
"October 21:
Dinner with Minnie."

23:52.390 --> 23:54.559
Minnie Blankenship.
He never showed up.

23:54.684 --> 23:55.769
He never called.

23:55.894 --> 23:57.187
You've been busy.

23:57.312 --> 24:00.899
I think my father ran into trouble ...
somewhere between here ... 

24:01.024 --> 24:02.525
and Santa Mira.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.486
Santa Mira?

24:04.611 --> 24:05.862
Where they make those.

24:05.987 --> 24:08.448
-Oh.
- Little place. Not too far away.

24:09.699 --> 24:11.576
Maybe they know something.

24:12.160 --> 24:15.955
I'm not going back to L.A,
until I find out what happened to my father.

24:24.506 --> 24:27.133
Linda, I can't get out of it.
I'm really sorry. I ...

24:27.258 --> 24:31.471
{y:i}You're gonna sit around...
- No. It's just a bunch of doctors talking about boring stuff.

24:31.596 --> 24:34.474
{y:i}The kids don't even remember your name!
- Linda, Linda take it easy.

24:34.599 --> 24:37.435
I'll be back to take 'em trick or treating. I promise. 

24:37.560 --> 24:40.522
I'll call...
{y:i}- Tell me where you're going to stay.
- No, I can't remember the name of the hotel. 

24:40.939 --> 24:41.898
I'll call you Monday.

24:42.023 --> 24:43.942
 I gotta go.
{y:i}- Wait a minute!
- Bye.

25:00.208 --> 25:03.628
{Y:i}"We'll be back with more" Dance Party
right after these messages.

25:09.301 --> 25:16.725
{y:i}* Two more days to Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
{y:i}* Two more days to Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *

25:16.850 --> 25:19.686
{y:i}* Two more days to Halloween, Halloween ... *

25:23.064 --> 25:25.317
I think it's the next exit.
- Wait a minute.

25:25.442 --> 25:26.860
Yeah, that's it.

25:26.985 --> 25:30.447
Then we go about ten miles
and turn right on 33.

25:30.613 --> 25:34.701
I wanna know, why they put their factory
out here in the middle of nowhere.

25:36.745 --> 25:37.495
Listen ...

25:37.912 --> 25:42.333
Santa Mira founded in 1887,
farming community.

25:42.459 --> 25:44.377
Grew up around a large dairy.

25:44.502 --> 25:49.758
After World War II ... a wealthy Irishman, Conal Cochran
converted it into a toy factory ...

25:49.883 --> 25:51.968
Silver Shamrock Novelties.

25:52.177 --> 25:55.764
Now given over to the manufacture
and sale of Halloween masks.

25:56.181 --> 25:57.640
Largest in the world.

25:57.766 --> 25:58.683
Proud community.

25:58.808 --> 26:00.393
Predominantly Irish.

26:00.518 --> 26:02.687
Irish Halloween masks?

26:02.812 --> 26:05.148
In California ... you never know.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.934
I feel like a goldfish.

26:41.059 --> 26:42.519
Company town.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.803
I'm not ready for this.
We need a plan. 

27:16.928 --> 27:18.555
Ok. How about this?

27:18.888 --> 27:20.682
We go back to that gas station ... 

27:20.807 --> 27:23.018
See if they know anything. We could a ... 

27:23.143 --> 27:26.855
pose as a couple of buyers
and maybe rent a couple of rooms in that motel.

27:27.397 --> 27:31.359
That way at least we'd have some place to talk without
the whole town watching us. 

27:31.484 --> 27:32.861
Good point.

27:52.005 --> 27:54.883
Good evening to you.
- Say partner a ...

27:55.008 --> 27:58.845
You haven't know is there a vacancy here in this motel?
My wife and I need a place to stay.

27:58.970 --> 28:01.056
You've come to the right place.

28:02.432 --> 28:06.394
It's cozy, it's quiet,
and the price is right.

28:07.479 --> 28:09.564
Keep him happy
just for a minute.

28:16.571 --> 28:19.908
Shower's good.
Put in new pipes last year.

28:34.547 --> 28:37.175
Any bags?
- Oh, yeah.

28:45.975 --> 28:47.727
Light packers, aren't ya?

28:47.852 --> 28:49.979
We've had a lot of practice.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.943
Ah! There's Mr. Cochran now.

29:08.915 --> 29:13.169
A great man, Conal Cochran.
A true genius.

29:26.099 --> 29:27.350
Daddy!

29:27.475 --> 29:30.395
Watch your driving, honey.
You could've killed that man.

29:31.479 --> 29:35.358
I didn't hurt him! Hey, sorry
about that. Glad it didn't hit ya.

29:36.109 --> 29:37.902
And great big thank you for pickin' it up.
You all right? 

29:38.028 --> 29:41.656
No problem.
- Hey, Buddy Kupfer, San Diego.

29:42.198 --> 29:44.117
This is my wife Betty.

29:44.242 --> 29:45.910
Please to meet you.

29:46.119 --> 29:48.163
And right there's Little Buddy.

29:48.455 --> 29:51.041
Is it busted?
- No.

29:51.207 --> 29:53.460
Don't you dare go in the street!

29:53.585 --> 29:55.628
Do you hear me?!

29:56.004 --> 29:58.173
I gotta go.
- I'll be checkin' you in now, sir.

29:58.298 --> 30:03.928
I fiilled out the register. I left $40 under the blotter.
That'd cover it? - Oh, heavens, yes. Thank you, sir.

30:04.054 --> 30:05.805
 Have a pleasant stay.

30:06.431 --> 30:10.560
Mr. Kupfer, I presume?
Your rooms are waiting.

30:10.685 --> 30:12.562
Damn factory! 

30:12.687 --> 30:17.150
Got their orders all screwed up.
Now I have to stay in this dump again!

30:18.568 --> 30:21.946
Oh, that's great.
Hey honey, it's a freebie!

30:28.787 --> 30:30.580
This place is a zoo.

30:30.747 --> 30:32.540
I saw Cochran.
His car, anyway.

30:32.666 --> 30:35.251
And your old man stayed here on the 20th. I was right!

30:35.377 --> 30:39.214
We'll go directly to the factory.
 - Whoa. Hold on. Slow down, slow down. It's getting late.

30:39.339 --> 30:40.799
I could use a drink. 

30:40.924 --> 30:42.384
Let's take our time.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.219
It's okay with you?

30:44.344 --> 30:45.762
To stay, I mean?

30:46.388 --> 30:48.181
Yeah, I think these a ... 

30:48.306 --> 30:51.768
clothes could probably hold out
for at least one more day.

30:54.646 --> 30:56.398
Maybe I ought to get another room.

30:56.690 --> 30:59.192
That would look sort of suspicious, wouldn't it?

30:59.609 --> 31:01.486
What I mean is, if you'd ...

31:01.611 --> 31:03.196
feel more comfortable ...

31:03.446 --> 31:04.989
I could sleep in the car.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.075
Be better than this floor, anyway.

31:08.785 --> 31:11.204
Where do you wanna sleep, Dr. Challis?

31:15.834 --> 31:18.044
That's a dumb question, Miss Grimbridge.

31:39.858 --> 31:43.069
{y:i}It's six o'clock ... it's six o'clock ...

31:43.194 --> 31:44.404
{y:i}Curfew.

31:45.113 --> 31:46.406
{y:i}Curfew.

31:46.823 --> 31:51.161
{y:i}All residents of Santa Mira, please clear the streets.

31:51.786 --> 31:54.664
{Y:i}Curfew is now in effect.

31:58.585 --> 32:02.255
{Y:i}Please confine your activities to your own homes.

32:02.380 --> 32:03.548
{y:i}Thank you.

32:04.716 --> 32:06.968
{y:i}Have a very pleasant evening.

33:17.998 --> 33:21.084
Oh, Jesus!
- Mister, I didn't mean to scare you.

33:21.209 --> 33:22.210
Saw that bottle.

33:22.335 --> 33:23.712
Thought it looked pretty heavy.

33:24.296 --> 33:27.382
I ain't got no diseases.
You mind if I have a drink?

33:33.054 --> 33:34.806
Goddamn.
Thank you.

33:34.931 --> 33:37.225
Hey, just a second. You are ...

33:37.350 --> 33:39.561
You have know anything about this Cochran?

33:39.686 --> 33:42.439
Cochran, Cochran?
Do I know anything?

33:43.189 --> 33:45.900
He made Santa Mira
what it is today.

33:46.568 --> 33:48.820
Dried up, little pile of nothing.

33:48.945 --> 33:50.739
Let me tell you something, mister.

33:50.989 --> 33:54.909
He brought in every damn one of
them factory people from the outside.

33:55.327 --> 33:57.662
You think he'd hire me?
A local boy? 

33:58.204 --> 34:00.457
No way. Turned me down flat.

34:01.666 --> 34:04.210
You haven't got a dollar you can spare, do you?

34:05.962 --> 34:06.838
Thank you.

34:07.714 --> 34:09.507
All I can tell you, mister ...

34:10.425 --> 34:11.259
is watch out.

34:11.384 --> 34:13.428
You seen the TV cameras yet?

34:14.012 --> 34:16.806
He's watching you, friend.
I guarantee you that.

34:17.349 --> 34:18.725
Hey, Cochran ..., fuck you.

34:19.100 --> 34:23.688
Fuck you! - Ooh, ooh, shh, easy.
- It's all right all right. It don't matter to me.

34:24.355 --> 34:26.065
He's probably listenin'.

34:26.274 --> 34:27.567
And if he is ...

34:28.025 --> 34:29.777
I got one thing to say.

34:30.737 --> 34:34.407
It's the last Halloween
for that lousy factory of his.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.786
Some pretty wild shit goin' on in there.
I ... I heard rumors.

34:38.911 --> 34:41.373
Like what? What'd you hear?
- This year ...

34:41.873 --> 34:42.998
I'm gonna get me ... 

34:43.123 --> 34:46.377
about a case and a half of Molotov cocktails.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.839
Burn that son of a bitch right down!

34:50.382 --> 34:52.592
Be the last Halloween for them.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.887
Last Halloween.

35:50.233 --> 35:51.192
What?

35:56.322 --> 36:00.201
Fellas, I was just kidding.
You know that ... You know that. Just kidding!

36:44.913 --> 36:46.748
Oh, sorry.

36:47.332 --> 36:49.250
I didn't mean to scare you.

36:49.584 --> 36:51.336
Are you picking up an order?

36:52.712 --> 36:54.798
Are you picking up
an order at the factory?

36:55.048 --> 37:00.136
Oh, yeah. - Oh, I figured.
There's no other reason to be in this godforsaken place.

37:00.345 --> 37:02.889
All I can say is, good luck to both of us.

37:03.014 --> 37:06.142
They may make great masks,
but ever since they started big volume business,

37:06.267 --> 37:08.937
the little guy has to stand in line.
You know, what I mean?

37:09.062 --> 37:10.605
I gave up ordering by mail. 

37:10.730 --> 37:13.108
But I hate trying to deal with 'em in person.

37:13.525 --> 37:14.943
You can't win.

37:15.068 --> 37:18.446
Oh, you know,
I hate to say anything, but ...

37:18.572 --> 37:19.989
the merchandise
is slipping.

37:20.115 --> 37:23.368
I mean. My four-year-old was throwing
the thing against the wall.

37:23.493 --> 37:25.453
The trademark shouldn't just come right off. 

37:25.578 --> 37:26.621
Yeah, I see what you mean.

37:26.746 --> 37:27.497
By the way ... 

37:27.622 --> 37:28.957
My name's Marge Guttman.

37:29.082 --> 37:32.460
My shop's on Union Square in San Francisco.
You can't miss it. - Okay. - Why don't you look me up?

37:32.585 --> 37:34.629
Yes. Thanks, I will.
- Bye.

38:37.150 --> 38:38.360
{y:i}Hello?
-Teddy. 

38:38.485 --> 38:39.569
I tried you at home.

38:39.694 --> 38:42.113
{y:i}Why would I be at home,
{y:i}when there's something like this cooking? 

38:42.239 --> 38:44.199
{y:i}Get it cooking.
- Got anything?

38:44.324 --> 38:46.951
No. Someone made
a colossal boo-boo.

38:47.077 --> 38:49.829
We've been doing an autopsy
on part of the car.

38:49.954 --> 38:54.250
C-4 something.
Just plastic and metal shavings.

38:54.375 --> 38:57.504
Two days wasted because
somebody mixed up the envelopes.

38:57.629 --> 38:58.963
Where are you calling from?

38:59.089 --> 39:00.173
Santa Mira.

39:00.298 --> 39:03.343
The Rose of Shannon Motel. I'll
check back with you tomorrow.

39:03.468 --> 39:05.553
All right, Sherlock.Ciao.

40:26.217 --> 40:29.888
{y:i}* Two more days to Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
These commercials ...

40:30.013 --> 40:32.140
{y:i}* Two more days to Halloween ...
never stops.

40:44.611 --> 40:45.528
Wait.

40:48.698 --> 40:51.493
Aren't you just ... the least bit tired?

40:51.618 --> 40:52.619
No.

40:55.622 --> 40:58.416
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

40:59.083 --> 41:00.585
How old are you?

41:01.503 --> 41:02.629
Relax. 

41:02.962 --> 41:04.673
I'm older than I look.

42:11.573 --> 42:12.407
What's that?

42:13.616 --> 42:15.201
Who cares?

43:01.289 --> 43:02.791
What the hell was that?

43:29.150 --> 43:30.193
What's going on?

43:30.318 --> 43:31.653
I don't know.

43:37.867 --> 43:41.287
Oh, my God. That must be Marge.
- Who's that? - A lady I met.

43:41.413 --> 43:44.791
Excuse me, I'm a doctor. Please.
I said I'm a doctor.

43:44.958 --> 43:46.835
Don't trouble yourself, sir. 

43:46.960 --> 43:49.504
She'll get the best care money can buy.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.635
Who's in charge of the patient?

43:56.094 --> 43:58.346
Why, Mr. Cochran, of course.

44:05.520 --> 44:09.941
Mr. Cochran, good to see you, sir.
- Good evening, Mr. Rafferty.

44:10.442 --> 44:13.570
It's all over, my friends.
Just a small accident.

44:13.695 --> 44:17.323
The lady's going to get the very best
possible treatment. I promise you that.

44:17.449 --> 44:18.742
Where are they taking her?

44:18.867 --> 44:20.744
They're taking her to the factory.

44:21.077 --> 44:25.457
We've the most marvelous facility
there for emergency treatment.

44:30.253 --> 44:32.672
What happened?
- Misfire.

44:37.635 --> 44:38.887
No, don't. 

44:39.179 --> 44:41.181
We can't afford to stick out.

44:43.308 --> 44:44.768
Let's just go.

45:10.668 --> 45:11.544
Misfiire?

45:11.669 --> 45:15.256
What the hell were they talking about?
- Something crazy going on here. - You wanna leave?

45:15.382 --> 45:16.758
Yes, very much.

45:16.883 --> 45:20.303
But not until I find out,
whether my father went to that factory.

45:45.620 --> 45:46.663
Hello?

45:46.788 --> 45:47.914
Can you talk?

45:48.039 --> 45:50.834
Sure. I just fiinished sifting the ashes.

45:51.042 --> 45:51.960
What do you have? 

45:52.085 --> 45:53.795
{y:i}It's what I don't have, that bothers me.

45:53.920 --> 45:55.964
You know, I'm starting to wonder if some...

45:56.715 --> 45:59.134
someone hasn't been tampering with this stuff.

45:59.342 --> 46:00.010
Why?

46:00.135 --> 46:04.514
Well ... that was a hot fire. But there would have to be
some bone fragments or teeth or something.

46:04.639 --> 46:07.434
I've got nothing here to indicate,
there was ever body at all. 

46:07.559 --> 46:08.977
Just ashes and car parts.

46:09.102 --> 46:10.145
How about you?

46:10.562 --> 46:14.899
Listen Teddy. Do me another favor.
Will you find out everything you can about Conal Cochran?

46:15.025 --> 46:18.111
He runs Silver Shamrock,
{y:i}the Halloween mask people.

46:18.778 --> 46:21.114
Conal Cochran.

46:23.366 --> 46:27.329
All right, but this is gonna cost you
some serious dinners when you get back.

46:27.454 --> 46:29.331
I'm always ready for dinner with you.

46:29.456 --> 46:31.124
Liar. Bye.

46:32.500 --> 46:33.501
Bye.

47:17.295 --> 47:19.422
Oh, there must be some mistake, dearie.

47:19.547 --> 47:25.136
Mr. Grimbridge himself picked up that order on the 21 st.
Here's his signature.

47:26.805 --> 47:27.764
Thank you.

47:28.890 --> 47:30.809
Do you remember that transaction?

47:30.934 --> 47:34.270
No ... but you can talk
to someone who might.

47:37.190 --> 47:38.400
Oh, Red ... 

47:38.525 --> 47:40.443
these people lost an order.

47:40.568 --> 47:42.445
Did you load this one?

47:43.154 --> 47:46.116
Sure did. Last week. A man
in an old green station wagon.

47:46.241 --> 47:48.076
That's right. Did he say
where he was going?

47:48.201 --> 47:51.246
No, ma'am. Headed out to
the north. I remember that.

47:53.206 --> 47:54.332
Thank you.

47:55.250 --> 47:59.045
Would you care to make another order, madam?
- No. Let's go.

48:02.799 --> 48:06.344
Well, hey.
How ya doin'?

48:06.678 --> 48:08.179
Buddy Kupfer and family ...

48:08.304 --> 48:11.808
here to see Mr. Cochran.
- Yes, Mr. Kupfer. Welcome.

48:11.933 --> 48:14.227
I'll tell Mr. Cochran, you're here.

48:19.566 --> 48:21.443
When do we get to see 'em
makin' the masks? 

48:21.568 --> 48:26.281
Real soon, little buddy. - Buddy, my feet are killing me.
- Honey, come on. The fun's just startin'.

48:26.406 --> 48:28.950
I've seen enough. Let's get out of here.
- All right, all right.

48:29.075 --> 48:29.993
Oh wait!

48:30.160 --> 48:30.952
Wait.

48:31.494 --> 48:32.329
Well,

48:32.912 --> 48:37.041
so this is Buddy Kupfer
and his lovely family.

48:37.709 --> 48:38.710
My friends ...  

48:38.835 --> 48:44.466
Mr. Kupfer has sold more Silver Shamrock masks
this year, by far, than anyone else in the country.

48:51.598 --> 48:55.602
And as for my other friends,
Mr. And Mrs...

48:55.852 --> 48:58.938
Smith.
- Smith, of course.

48:59.063 --> 49:05.570
My apologies for that little bit of a disturbance last night,
but I want you both to know,
that Mrs. Guttman is going to be fine.

49:05.695 --> 49:08.656
She's been flown to a hospital in San Francisco. 

49:09.157 --> 49:09.616
Thank you.

49:09.741 --> 49:10.825
For and a ...

49:10.992 --> 49:13.078
About the confusion over your order.

49:13.203 --> 49:14.454
I'll just tell you one thing... 

49:14.579 --> 49:18.750
A replacement order is being prepared
for you absolutely free ...

49:18.875 --> 49:20.835
The whole thing's on me.

49:23.630 --> 49:25.966
Is he incredible or what?

49:26.091 --> 49:27.884
Now. How would you like a guided tour?

49:28.009 --> 49:29.469
Oh, thank you, sir.

49:29.594 --> 49:31.971
 Would it be all right if my friends come along?

49:32.097 --> 49:35.934
Oh ... yes, I was just about to ask them.
If you'd like to?

49:37.018 --> 49:38.687
We'd love to.

49:38.812 --> 49:39.854
Come along.

49:40.021 --> 49:40.939
Come along.

50:06.131 --> 50:10.343
The latex is heated and poured.
After that, it's cooled and poured off.

50:10.468 --> 50:14.931
Then it's all just a matter of trimming,
painting and packaging.

50:46.504 --> 50:50.342
Oh, wow, this is it.
Hall of fame time.

50:50.467 --> 50:52.552
What's famous?
You really don't know?

50:52.677 --> 50:56.139
Conal Cochran, the all-time
genius of the practical joke.

50:56.264 --> 50:58.600
He invented sticky toilet paper.

50:59.351 --> 51:04.272
Oh, you must know. The dead
dwarf gag, the soft chain saw. All his.

51:04.397 --> 51:07.192
No, gee, I didn't know that.
- And before that, he used to make toys.

51:07.317 --> 51:11.655
Remember that? I had one of those when
I was a kid. Used to sit and watch it for hours.

51:12.364 --> 51:15.492
The man has always paid attention to detail.

51:16.493 --> 51:19.037
Are we all together?
- Yeah.

51:21.998 --> 51:25.460
Oh, I want a mask.
Can I have a mask?

51:25.710 --> 51:28.838
Just what I had in mind for you, Little Buddy.
- I want that one.

51:28.963 --> 51:30.507
Oh, no, no, no, no.

51:31.299 --> 51:32.634
Look over here.

51:32.759 --> 51:35.553
Those masks haven't been through final processing.

51:37.680 --> 51:38.973
This one has.

51:43.895 --> 51:45.563
There you are.

51:45.980 --> 51:47.857
That's wonderful.

51:49.943 --> 51:53.280
What final process?
- Don't ask me.

52:06.042 --> 52:08.586
Hey, Mr. Cochran,
just what is the final process?

52:08.712 --> 52:11.798
I asure you it's just a little bit of this
and a little bit of that.

52:12.215 --> 52:15.885
Quality inspection, the seal of approval.
You know, the usual.

52:16.761 --> 52:17.971
And of course ...  

52:18.096 --> 52:19.514
there's a couple of ...

52:19.723 --> 52:21.182
trade secrets.

52:21.307 --> 52:23.977
I'd sure love to take a look.

52:24.102 --> 52:26.354
Oh, sorry.

52:26.479 --> 52:29.941
Not even a peek for your best
salesman? Oh, just one little look.

52:30.066 --> 52:31.192
Well you see ...

52:31.317 --> 52:33.612
Part of the inspection process involves ...

52:33.737 --> 52:40.201
volatile chemicals, very dangerous. I wouldn't want to put
anybody in any danger. - Oh sure, I understand.

52:40.326 --> 52:43.913
Now listen ... I hope you and your family will be able
to have breakfast with me tomorrow morning.

52:44.039 --> 52:47.375
I'd like your opinion on some of our sales material.
- My opinion? 

52:47.500 --> 52:48.626
Oh, sure.

52:48.752 --> 52:51.337
Do you know he's one of the
richest men in the country?

52:51.463 --> 52:55.133
And he got that way selling
cheap gags and Halloween masks.

52:55.258 --> 52:57.260
Oh god, there's hope for us yet.

52:57.385 --> 53:03.725
It's very valuable to me, you know. Your opinion has
always meant a great deal to us. - Oh, thank you, sir.

53:03.850 --> 53:06.478
Where's Little Buddy?
- Oh, there he is, running down there.

53:06.603 --> 53:07.729
See him there?
- Oh, yes.

53:07.854 --> 53:12.942
Into everything always.
We like to know everything there is to know.

53:13.276 --> 53:16.613
Like father, like son.
- Oh, yeah.

53:20.492 --> 53:21.618
Excuse me.

53:21.743 --> 53:22.619
Darling?

53:22.744 --> 53:24.954
I think it's time we were going.

53:27.499 --> 53:28.917
See you later.

53:30.960 --> 53:31.795
What's up?

53:32.754 --> 53:36.800
I just saw a couple of men
who looked strangely familiar.

53:38.093 --> 53:39.552
And there's another one.

53:39.677 --> 53:42.889
They look a lot like the man,
who killed your father.

53:50.772 --> 53:53.024
Oh, my God!
- What?

53:53.316 --> 53:55.110
That's Papa's car. 

53:55.485 --> 53:58.071
Wait, Ellie, Ellie. Don't.

54:09.499 --> 54:11.042
Trade secrets.

54:28.310 --> 54:30.812
I saw it.
I know I saw it.

54:30.979 --> 54:32.647
I think it's time
for the marines.

54:32.772 --> 54:34.733
I'm scared. I think we should leave.

54:35.650 --> 54:36.484
All right.

54:37.986 --> 54:39.321
You pack ...

54:39.529 --> 54:43.032
I'll call the police.
This place has to fall under somebody's jurisdiction.

54:43.158 --> 54:46.202
Let's go soon, okay?
- All right, all right.

55:04.804 --> 55:05.805
Hallo.

55:15.857 --> 55:18.443
Operator, this is an emergency. I wanna ...
{y:i}I'm sorry.

55:18.568 --> 55:20.946
{y:i}We cannot complete your call as dialed. 

55:21.071 --> 55:22.781
{y:i}Please hang up and t...

55:23.490 --> 55:30.956
{y:i}* One more days to Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
{y:i}* One more days to Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *

55:31.081 --> 55:34.167
{y:i}* One more days to Halloween ... *
 - Yes ... information.

55:34.292 --> 55:37.003
{y:i}I'm sorry. We cannot complete your call as dialed.

55:37.128 --> 55:40.173
{Y:i}Please hang up and check the number and dial again.
{y:i}* Just one more day ... *

55:40.298 --> 55:45.553
{Y:i}Only 24 hours, but that's plenty of time
{y:i}to pick out one more day halloween ...

56:07.075 --> 56:07.992
Ellie?

56:10.286 --> 56:11.246
Ellie?

57:27.572 --> 57:29.157
Operator.
{y:i}If you'd like to make a call, 

57:29.282 --> 57:31.910
Operator!
{y:i}Please hang up and try again.

57:37.874 --> 57:41.044
{y:i}If you'd like to make a call,
{y:i}please hang up and try again.

57:41.169 --> 57:44.839
{Y:i}If you need help, you have to
{y:i}dial your operator for assistance.

01:00:26.584 --> 01:00:28.044
Where's the girl?

01:00:29.963 --> 01:00:30.880
Where is she? 

01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:35.260
Where is she?
Where is she?!

01:01:01.244 --> 01:01:04.331
Oh, Jesus. Je...

01:01:57.717 --> 01:01:58.802
Clumsy.

01:02:03.473 --> 01:02:05.225
This was a rare piece.

01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:06.601
German.

01:02:07.102 --> 01:02:08.812
Made in Munich ... 

01:02:09.104 --> 01:02:11.106
1785.

01:02:11.606 --> 01:02:13.650
I must try to get a replacement.

01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:20.198
Ah, Mr. Challis.
- Where is Ellie?

01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:22.158
Mrs. Smith.

01:02:22.617 --> 01:02:25.704
Ah, sure I believe she's resting just now.

01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:30.416
Didn't take you long to get here, Mr. Challis.

01:02:30.542 --> 01:02:32.794
Dr. Challis, I should say.

01:02:37.215 --> 01:02:39.134
It'll be morning soon.

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:45.432
Halloween morning.

01:02:46.224 --> 01:02:48.018
It'll be a very busy day for me.

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:53.148
Being a medical man,
you should find it quite interesting.

01:03:56.127 --> 01:04:01.049
The surprising thing is that the internal
components were quite simple to produce, really.

01:04:01.174 --> 01:04:02.509
The outer features ... 

01:04:02.634 --> 01:04:07.430
took much longer to perfect. But then, of course
in the end it's just another form of mask making.

01:04:10.642 --> 01:04:11.559
Bless you.

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.228
Convincing, aren't they?

01:04:13.687 --> 01:04:17.232
Loyal and obedient,
unlike most human beings.

01:04:30.578 --> 01:04:32.831
Those who went before me, you know they...

01:04:33.081 --> 01:04:35.416
they never dreamed of anything like this.

01:04:35.959 --> 01:04:38.586
What is this place?
- Oh, can't you tell?

01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:40.797
Advanced and...

01:04:41.673 --> 01:04:43.675
ancient technology.

01:04:46.219 --> 01:04:48.847
A good magician never explains.

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:50.223
Come on, then.

01:04:50.515 --> 01:04:54.394
You've still got time
to figure it out all by yourself.

01:05:26.217 --> 01:05:28.678
From an ancient sacrificial circle.

01:05:29.554 --> 01:05:30.722
Stonehenge.

01:05:33.642 --> 01:05:36.519
We had a time getting it here.

01:05:37.354 --> 01:05:39.981
You wouldn't believe, how we did it.

01:05:51.826 --> 01:05:53.620
It has a power in it.

01:05:55.121 --> 01:05:56.122
A force.

01:05:57.832 --> 01:05:59.209
Even a... 

01:06:00.877 --> 01:06:02.128
particle.

01:06:09.969 --> 01:06:11.387
Devastating.

01:06:30.448 --> 01:06:32.450
Oh, Doctor, you asked about the girl.

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:41.793
Where is she?

01:06:42.961 --> 01:06:44.796
Right in there.

01:06:47.257 --> 01:06:48.883
And your friend, Miss Guttman.

01:06:49.009 --> 01:06:53.179
You killed her.
- Oh, no. Miss Guttman was the victim of a misfire.

01:06:53.722 --> 01:06:54.973
The others...

01:06:55.974 --> 01:07:00.353
What you really need to see is a demonstration
and there's one coming right up.

01:07:43.855 --> 01:07:46.149
{y:i}Mr. Cochran will be right along.

01:07:46.524 --> 01:07:49.611
{y:i}I don't like this place.I{y:i}it gives me the creeps.

01:07:50.236 --> 01:07:52.864
{y:i}I have to go to the bathroom.

01:07:54.073 --> 01:07:56.701
Mommy!
- Relax a minute, will you?

01:07:57.202 --> 01:07:59.496
Mr. Cochran'll be here.
Then everything will be fine.

01:07:59.621 --> 01:08:03.458
He just wants my opinion about some
television commercials or something.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.212
You know, I still can't figure out why
they won't take my orders for next year.

01:08:07.337 --> 01:08:10.757
{Y:i}You know how I like to work ahead,
{y:i}and well, they're just not interested at all.

01:08:10.882 --> 01:08:13.802
Maybe they're not going to
have Halloween next year.

01:08:16.805 --> 01:08:18.473
All right, roll it.

01:08:33.404 --> 01:08:36.157
{y:i}It's time, it's time.

01:08:36.282 --> 01:08:38.660
{y:i}Time for the big giveaway.
- This is just the same old stuff.

01:08:40.203 --> 01:08:44.707
{y:i}All you lucky kids with Silver Shamrock masks,
{y:i}gather 'round your TV set.

01:08:44.832 --> 01:08:50.171
{y:i}Put on your masks and watch.
- Honey, don't get too close, you'll ruin your eyes.

01:08:50.964 --> 01:08:55.969
Gather 'round and watch.
Watch the magic pumpkin. Watch.

01:09:02.725 --> 01:09:04.519
I think this whole thing ...

01:09:04.644 --> 01:09:05.895
is a big joke.

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:08.022
I mean, look at that.

01:09:15.363 --> 01:09:17.240
I mean, look.

01:09:19.242 --> 01:09:20.035
Betty.

01:09:29.167 --> 01:09:30.211
Honey?

01:11:18.027 --> 01:11:25.368
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *

01:11:25.493 --> 01:11:33.459
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *

01:11:33.585 --> 01:11:37.005
{Y:i}It's almost time, kids.
The clock is ticking.

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:39.758
{Y:i}Be in front of your TVsets
for the "Horrorathon."

01:11:39.883 --> 01:11:42.427
{y:i}And during the big giveaway at nine.

01:11:42.552 --> 01:11:43.595
{y:i}Don't miss it. 

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:47.849
{y:i}And don't forget to wear your masks.
{y:i}The clock is ticking. It's almost time.

01:11:47.974 --> 01:11:55.607
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *

01:11:55.732 --> 01:12:03.448
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Halloween, Halloween *
{y:i}* Happy, happy Halloween, Silver Shamrock. *

01:12:06.409 --> 01:12:08.912
{y:i}Hurry home. It's almost time.

01:12:09.037 --> 01:12:14.250
{y:i}All those lucky kids with Silver Shamrock masks,
hurry home for the big giveaway.

01:12:14.375 --> 01:12:17.587
{y:i}It's almost time. Hurry home.

01:12:49.452 --> 01:12:53.540
{y:i}What city, please?
The number for Santa Mira,
the Rose of Shannon Motel, please.

01:12:53.707 --> 01:12:57.710
{y:i}555-2462.
Thank you.

01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:24.028
{y:i}I'm sorry. We cannot complete your call as dialed.
{y:i}Please hang up and dial again. This is a record ...

01:13:32.704 --> 01:13:34.331
{y:i}Hello?
Roger?

01:13:34.456 --> 01:13:36.791
Did I wake you?
Oh, sorry.

01:13:36.916 --> 01:13:39.669
Listen. I've got something down here
I'd like for you to look at.

01:13:39.794 --> 01:13:40.336
{y:i}What?

01:13:40.461 --> 01:13:43.923
I know I could be wrong,
but I don't think it's a car part at all.

01:13:44.048 --> 01:13:46.509
Maybe you've seen something like it.
{y:i}How's tomorrow afternoon?

01:13:46.634 --> 01:13:49.220
Tomorrow afternoon?
Okay, great. Thanks, Roger.

01:13:49.346 --> 01:13:50.096
Bye.

01:14:40.104 --> 01:14:42.065
Oh, my God.

01:14:46.528 --> 01:14:49.072
{y:i}May I help you?
Operator, can you get me the sheriff...

01:15:38.497 --> 01:15:40.665
Enjoy the "Horrorathon," Doctor.

01:15:41.208 --> 01:15:44.043
And don't forget to watch
the big giveaway afterwards.

01:15:46.087 --> 01:15:47.964
Why, Cochran? Why?

01:15:48.089 --> 01:15:49.716
Do I need a reason?

01:15:50.425 --> 01:15:52.844
Mr. Kupfer was right, you know.

01:15:53.136 --> 01:15:58.850
I do love a good joke. And this is the best ever.
A joke on the children.

01:16:00.268 --> 01:16:02.229
But there's a better reason.

01:16:02.729 --> 01:16:06.191
You don't really know much
about Halloween.

01:16:06.608 --> 01:16:13.865
You thought no further than the strange custom of
having your children wear masks and go out
begging for candy.

01:16:18.119 --> 01:16:22.749
It was the start of the year in our old Celtic lands
and we'd be waiting ...

01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:26.461
in our houses of wattles and clay.

01:16:26.711 --> 01:16:29.005
The barriers would be down, you see,

01:16:29.339 --> 01:16:31.716
Between the real and the unreal.

01:16:32.467 --> 01:16:34.511
And the dead might be looking in ...

01:16:34.803 --> 01:16:37.430
to sit by our fires of turf.

01:16:40.725 --> 01:16:42.144
Halloween.

01:16:44.604 --> 01:16:46.689
The festival of Samhain.

01:16:46.814 --> 01:16:52.153
The last great one took place 3,000 years ago
and the hills ran red ...

01:16:53.071 --> 01:16:55.281
with the blood of animals and children.

01:16:56.408 --> 01:16:58.118
Sacrifices.

01:16:58.243 --> 01:16:59.953
It was a part of our world ...

01:17:00.453 --> 01:17:01.955
Our craft.

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.751
Witchcraft.
- To us, it was a way of controlling our environment.

01:17:07.085 --> 01:17:08.878
It's not so different now.

01:17:09.629 --> 01:17:11.339
It's time again.

01:17:12.674 --> 01:17:14.175
In the end ... 

01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:16.761
We don't decide these things, you know.

01:17:18.138 --> 01:17:19.973
The planets do.

01:17:24.144 --> 01:17:25.979
They're in alignment.

01:17:26.271 --> 01:17:28.481
And it's time again.

01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:31.317
The world's going to change tonight, Doctor.

01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:34.529
I'm glad you'll be able to watch it.

01:17:43.246 --> 01:17:44.164
And...

01:17:47.125 --> 01:17:48.960
happy Halloween.

01:19:21.761 --> 01:19:24.472
Cochran.
{y:i}- It's just that work ...

01:19:25.015 --> 01:19:27.058
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:56.838
Tonight's just for fun. A way of saying
"thank you" to all our good customers.

01:19:57.088 --> 01:19:58.173
Mr. Cochran.
