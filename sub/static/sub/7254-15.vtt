WEBVTT

00:04.906 --> 00:05.828
Yes?

00:06.340 --> 00:08.646
Um, Paris, it's Lorelai.

00:09.159 --> 00:11.208
Come in. The door is open.

00:13.406 --> 00:15.717
I'm so sorry that it's so early.
I --

00:15.747 --> 00:17.028
Oh. Wow. Hey.

00:17.058 --> 00:19.651
Sorry. We're in the middle
of our yoga practice.

00:19.681 --> 00:22.756
I didn't really imagine you
guys to be the yoga types.

00:22.786 --> 00:24.793
It was a circuitous
path that led us here.

00:24.823 --> 00:27.010
I only signed up for the class
'cause I thought it'd help me

00:27.047 --> 00:29.280
B.S. my way through any
med-school interviews

00:29.312 --> 00:32.536
when they talk about all
that homeopathic, holistic,

00:32.560 --> 00:34.958
naturopathic,
chiropractic, TCM,

00:34.985 --> 00:36.598
unani, ayurveda crap.

00:36.629 --> 00:39.621
Plus, we thought it would be
funny to goof on. But now...

00:39.658 --> 00:41.810
I guess the great
cosmic goof is on us.

00:41.847 --> 00:43.430
Is Rory asleep?

00:43.465 --> 00:45.343
You mean spiritually
or literally?

00:45.376 --> 00:46.122
Literally.

00:46.158 --> 00:47.473
Yeah, I think so.

00:51.476 --> 00:52.492
Hey, mom.

00:52.528 --> 00:55.492
Hey. Sorry I didn't call first.
I left my phone at home.

00:55.527 --> 00:57.052
And it's 6:00 in the morning.
Why are you up?

00:57.088 --> 00:59.222
Paris and Doyle were chanting.
Why are you up?

00:59.255 --> 01:01.221
Oh, I've been up for a while,
driving --

01:01.257 --> 01:02.611
- Driving?
- Yeah, for a few hours.

01:02.628 --> 01:03.671
- Driving?
- Yeah, driving.

01:03.708 --> 01:05.552
- Mom, what's going on?
- Want to go for a drive?

01:05.588 --> 01:07.691
Um, sure. Let's go for a drive.

01:11.138 --> 01:12.733
So... we're driving.

01:12.765 --> 01:13.992
Yeah, we're driving.

01:20.177 --> 01:22.941
Honey, your dad and I
split up last night.

01:23.596 --> 01:26.780
Oh, mom, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

01:26.818 --> 01:28.912
I'm okay --
I'm driving, moving forward.

01:28.946 --> 01:30.490
- You are driving.
- Yep.

01:30.996 --> 01:33.753
It just wasn't right, you know?
And he knew it wasn't right,

01:33.788 --> 01:35.832
and I knew it wasn't right.
It just wasn't...

01:36.686 --> 01:38.120
- It wasn't right.
- It wasn't,

01:38.155 --> 01:40.282
and pretending it was was just
gonna hurt him and hurt me,

01:40.317 --> 01:42.992
and we didn't want to do that,
so we split up,

01:43.027 --> 01:46.163
and he's moving out, and...
what are you thinking?

01:46.196 --> 01:49.432
I don't know.
I guess, first of all, I'm sorry.

01:49.468 --> 01:52.500
I'm so sorry.
And... secondly...

01:52.675 --> 01:56.000
I guess I'm thinking that
I'm not totally surprised.

01:56.037 --> 02:01.102
I mean, at first, I was so excited
that you guys were getting together

02:01.137 --> 02:03.253
because it seemed like
something that was meant to be,

02:03.288 --> 02:05.553
something that
was like destiny.

02:05.588 --> 02:08.333
But... then... I guess...

02:08.507 --> 02:10.953
to me,
it kind of never felt right.

02:11.325 --> 02:12.360
I'm so sorry.

02:12.398 --> 02:16.031
I just want you to know, your dad is
gonna be in your life -- in our lives.

02:16.065 --> 02:17.103
I know that.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.780
And G.G., too. I mean,

02:19.475 --> 02:21.193
your dad is still your dad,
you know?

02:21.225 --> 02:23.072
I know that, mom. I do.

02:24.688 --> 02:26.623
So, who else knows?

02:27.158 --> 02:28.551
Nobody. That's it.

02:28.587 --> 02:30.872
Well, you and the
Quickie Mart guy.

02:30.907 --> 02:32.260
You told the Quickie Mart guy?

02:32.298 --> 02:34.131
I was upset.
I was standing by the magazines.

02:34.168 --> 02:37.272
I didn't want him to think I was
verklempt over Nicole Richie so...

02:37.976 --> 02:40.400
that's it.
I wish I could leave it at that.

02:40.436 --> 02:43.650
The idea of telling your
grandmother -- God.

02:44.807 --> 02:47.960
- Oh. Oh, wow.
- What?

02:49.257 --> 02:50.910
We're out of gas?

02:50.948 --> 02:52.670
We're out of... gas.

02:58.658 --> 03:01.221
- I've never run out of gas before.
- Me neither.

03:02.287 --> 03:03.641
Well, here we are.

03:04.135 --> 03:05.400
Out of gas.

03:06.005 --> 03:07.530
Well, I guess I should ca--

03:07.895 --> 03:09.223
I don't have my cellphone.

03:10.788 --> 03:12.562
I left mine in my room.

03:14.958 --> 03:17.633
Okay. It's okay. No, it's fine.

03:17.667 --> 03:20.301
We'll just have to get gas somehow.
We can do this.

03:20.338 --> 03:24.001
There's a gas station up ahead,
where route 68 goes through Naugatuck.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.111
Okay.

03:25.467 --> 03:27.680
So... we're walking?

03:27.717 --> 03:29.070
Oh, we're walking.

03:37.428 --> 03:38.870
Well, it's a beautiful day.

03:38.906 --> 03:40.252
Yes, it is.

03:40.537 --> 03:42.321
It's weird that it
can be so beautiful.

03:42.357 --> 03:43.493
Yeah.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.111
How far is Naugatuck from here?

03:46.166 --> 03:47.802
I don't know exactly.

03:48.236 --> 03:50.200
I guess it's walking distance.

03:50.996 --> 03:52.940
I hope it's walking distance.

04:52.428 --> 04:53.372
Hello?

04:53.776 --> 04:55.143
- Hi, there.
- How you doing?

04:55.178 --> 04:57.093
- How are you?
- May I take your coats?

04:57.135 --> 04:59.290
- Coats?
- Oh. Okay.

04:59.645 --> 05:00.711
Thank you.

05:01.535 --> 05:04.631
Um-- I-- th--
I think she's in the living room.

05:04.665 --> 05:06.333
I'm not sure--
maybe-- not sure--

05:07.486 --> 05:09.550
What? Her mouth is moving.

05:09.586 --> 05:11.262
I can't hear anything.
Is something wrong with my ears?

05:11.298 --> 05:12.972
No, I don't think it's your ears,
poor thing.

05:13.006 --> 05:15.890
This house is a giant skinner box
with chippendale chairs. Hello?

05:15.926 --> 05:17.100
In here!

05:18.206 --> 05:19.600
- Hey, mom.
- Hey, grandma.

05:19.637 --> 05:21.780
Hello, Rory, Lorelai.
How are you?

05:21.817 --> 05:25.100
Good. How are you? How's dad?
Is he up to this, you think?

05:25.137 --> 05:25.942
Why wouldn't he be?

05:25.976 --> 05:29.931
Well, mom, he just got out of the
hospital. I wonder if it's too soon.

05:29.967 --> 05:32.800
The doctor said there's no reason he
can't go back to his normal routine,

05:32.837 --> 05:34.941
as long as he doesn't do
anything too strenuous.

05:34.977 --> 05:37.932
It's not as though sitting at a table,
having dinner with one's family

05:37.968 --> 05:39.513
requires a great
deal of effort.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.513
Well... you're right.

05:42.575 --> 05:44.013
He should be down by now.

05:44.655 --> 05:45.990
Is Christopher coming?

05:46.025 --> 05:49.101
Um... he's not able to make it tonight.
I'm sorry.

05:49.135 --> 05:50.113
Well...

05:50.537 --> 05:51.663
that's too bad.

05:52.696 --> 05:54.950
In the meantime,
can I offer you a drink?

05:54.985 --> 05:57.810
Yes. The usual --
Martini up, with a twist.

05:57.848 --> 06:00.573
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not serving alcohol tonight.

06:00.755 --> 06:02.750
I told you there was something
wrong with my ears. What?

06:02.787 --> 06:05.003
I'm serving nonalcoholic
cocktails only.

06:05.038 --> 06:06.953
There's no such thing as
a nonalcoholic cocktail.

06:06.987 --> 06:09.171
There most certainly is.
It's called a mocktail.

06:09.207 --> 06:11.131
- You're serving mocktails?
- Yes.

06:11.165 --> 06:13.721
I can offer you a Shirley
Temple or a Roy Rogers.

06:13.756 --> 06:14.932
I'll have a Roy Rogers.

06:14.966 --> 06:17.463
Why not a howdy doody
or a captain Kangaroo?

06:17.497 --> 06:20.532
Lorelai, stop being so selfish.
We're doing this for your father.

06:20.567 --> 06:24.241
After you've had open-heart surgery,
alcohol is strictly verboten.

06:24.278 --> 06:26.220
No alcohol. No alcohol.

06:26.256 --> 06:29.260
Well, there you are.
I told you to tell Mr. Gilmore

06:29.296 --> 06:30.821
that his daughter
and granddaughter

06:30.905 --> 06:33.390
were pulling into the
driveway 15 minutes ago.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.680
Mr. Gilmore says he's in
the middle of watching golf

06:35.716 --> 06:37.470
and he'll be down as
soon as he's finished.

06:37.505 --> 06:39.613
Golf? He's watching golf?

06:39.915 --> 06:41.960
Well, if you tell him we're
expecting him downstairs,

06:41.995 --> 06:43.271
I would very much
appreciate it.

06:43.307 --> 06:46.492
I'm not really sure that falls
under my job description.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.821
Fine. Fine.

06:50.206 --> 06:51.352
Fine.

06:51.947 --> 06:53.231
Fine.

06:54.758 --> 06:56.791
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

06:58.725 --> 07:01.071
Oh, that's a strong one, mom.
You know I'm driving.

07:01.235 --> 07:02.111
Tastes great.

07:02.146 --> 07:03.542
You know what se
tastes great? Rum.

07:03.555 --> 07:05.070
For heaven's sake, Lorelai.

07:05.102 --> 07:07.396
If you're unable to go for
a few hours without alcohol,

07:07.420 --> 07:09.828
I can send the maid out
to get you a six-pack.

07:10.185 --> 07:12.788
- Richard!
- All right. I'm here.

07:12.819 --> 07:14.391
You can put away your leash.

07:14.427 --> 07:15.962
- Hey, grandpa.
- Hey, dad.

07:16.158 --> 07:18.601
- Rory, Lorelai.
- How are you feeling?

07:18.636 --> 07:20.281
Like a man who's been torn away

07:20.317 --> 07:22.652
from one of the most pivotal
golf matches in history.

07:22.685 --> 07:24.452
If you're not up for it,
we can take a rain check.

07:24.488 --> 07:25.783
We don't need a rain check.

07:25.818 --> 07:27.831
Richard, wouldn't you like
to change for dinner?

07:27.868 --> 07:29.522
No, if you're going to
treat me like a patient,

07:29.557 --> 07:32.103
I'm going to act like a patient.
Patients wear robes.

07:32.136 --> 07:35.430
All right. Fine.
May I offer you a mocktail?

07:35.467 --> 07:37.021
No. I don't want a mocktail.

07:37.056 --> 07:39.770
In fact, I'd like to skip
"mocktail hour" altogether

07:39.806 --> 07:41.193
and go straight to dinner.

07:41.226 --> 07:43.031
But it isn't time yet to --

07:44.458 --> 07:46.312
All right. We'll eat now.

07:46.346 --> 07:48.913
Francette, would you please
go tell Aurora to tell Stefan

07:48.948 --> 07:50.841
we are ready to have
dinner served now?

07:50.876 --> 07:53.080
Look, Mrs.
Gilmore, I have to reiterate,

07:53.116 --> 07:55.123
I am here as a
medical professional,

07:55.156 --> 07:56.460
not a carrier pigeon.

07:56.495 --> 07:59.561
Well, as a medical professional,
you should be concerned with my health.

07:59.597 --> 08:02.273
And not eating isn't healthy,
is it?

08:02.305 --> 08:04.102
Nor is getting agitated.

08:04.138 --> 08:06.610
And I have to tell you, Francette,
I'm getting quite agitated.

08:06.645 --> 08:08.081
Don't threaten me, Mr. Gilmore.

08:08.116 --> 08:10.520
It's fine, it's fine.
I'll go tell her myself.

08:12.585 --> 08:13.641
Wow.

08:13.855 --> 08:16.043
A six-pack sounds
really good right now.

08:19.635 --> 08:20.800
Here's your plate, sir.

08:20.838 --> 08:23.070
I hope it's not too hot --
the plate, not the food.

08:27.138 --> 08:30.020
Oh, well. It's fish again.

08:30.055 --> 08:31.201
It's sea bass.

08:31.238 --> 08:33.640
And sea bass is a fish --
hence my comment

08:33.674 --> 08:36.360
"surprise, surprise --
it's fish again."

08:36.398 --> 08:37.402
It tastes good.

08:37.437 --> 08:38.381
Tastes like fish.

08:38.414 --> 08:39.880
I don't think it tastes fishy.

08:39.918 --> 08:41.563
Sea bash is not a fishy fish.

08:41.597 --> 08:44.791
Mackerel is a fishy fish.
Trout can be a fishy fish.

08:44.828 --> 08:47.290
But sea bass is not
really a fishy fish.

08:47.325 --> 08:50.623
I didn't say it tasted fishy.
I said it tasted like fish.

08:50.656 --> 08:51.920
I think it tastes good.

08:51.955 --> 08:54.523
The green beans are very green-beany,
which is so good,

08:54.555 --> 08:56.472
especially if you like green beans,
which I do.

08:57.965 --> 08:59.511
Anyone see any good
movies lately?

08:59.548 --> 09:01.641
- No.
- This fish is bland.

09:02.197 --> 09:04.231
Would you like some
more lemon-dill sauce?

09:04.267 --> 09:05.121
No.

09:05.527 --> 09:06.373
Okay.

09:06.405 --> 09:07.621
The sauce is good, mom.

09:07.656 --> 09:08.882
It's nice, isn't it?

09:08.915 --> 09:10.280
Tart, but not too tart.

09:10.316 --> 09:13.481
Stefan, the chef we stole from the
Lowells, is doing a marvelous job

09:13.518 --> 09:15.540
incorporating the dietary
recommendations --

09:15.576 --> 09:16.710
Enough.

09:16.956 --> 09:18.971
If forced, I may eat this fish,

09:19.006 --> 09:22.853
but I absolutely refuse to waste my
time having a conversation about it.

09:23.515 --> 09:27.483
So, Lorelai, I take it that
Christopher is still out of town?

09:27.518 --> 09:29.083
He couldn't make it tonight.

09:29.116 --> 09:30.193
That's too bad.

09:30.228 --> 09:32.373
That man has been traveling
quite a lot lately.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.331
Oh yeah? I guess.

09:33.365 --> 09:36.111
I hope he'll be around for the
party your mother's planning.

09:36.148 --> 09:37.651
I know I'm looking
forward to it.

09:37.705 --> 09:40.632
It's my only hope for eating a
decent meal in the forceable future.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.343
Your mother was planning to
serve cornish game hens.

09:43.377 --> 09:44.862
Is that still the plan, Emily?

09:44.897 --> 09:47.192
Yes, I've even spoken to
the caterer about preparing

09:47.227 --> 09:48.920
a special skinless hen for you.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.892
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

09:50.928 --> 09:52.372
Don't get angry, Richard.

09:52.407 --> 09:54.350
It's your doctor's orders,
not mine.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.070
You know what? I'm full.

09:56.428 --> 09:57.940
These flowers are pretty.

09:57.976 --> 09:59.472
They really are nice.

09:59.505 --> 10:01.621
If you will excuse me,
I have to get back to my golf.

10:01.638 --> 10:02.961
- Richard!
- Please.

10:02.997 --> 10:05.181
I know I've missed
Jacklin's bogey on the 16th.

10:05.215 --> 10:06.940
I'm not missing his
putt on the 17th.

10:06.977 --> 10:08.631
That's a famous putt, Emily.

10:08.667 --> 10:11.460
Wait --
you're watching an old golf game?

10:11.498 --> 10:14.600
Well, it's the last singles
match of the '69 Ryder cup.

10:14.637 --> 10:16.733
Jacklin, Nicklaus --
the concession!

10:16.768 --> 10:20.211
I can't believe you're watching an
old golf game instead of eating...

10:20.245 --> 10:22.053
- Fish?
- Dinner with your family.

10:22.085 --> 10:23.620
You already know how
it's going to turn out.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.982
Well, that never stopped
people going to see "Hamlet."

10:26.106 --> 10:28.873
Lorelai, Rory,
good night. Emily.

10:30.386 --> 10:33.112
Richard... Richard!

10:34.106 --> 10:37.471
The idea that two grown men hitting
a tiny ball with metal sticks

10:37.505 --> 10:40.223
is the equivalent of
"Hamlet" -- ridiculous.

10:40.258 --> 10:43.070
But can I say anything? No!
Because I can't agitate him.

10:43.107 --> 10:45.600
It is ridiculous.
Golf is really more like "Richard III."

10:45.638 --> 10:46.720
They're all hunched over.

10:46.757 --> 10:48.051
I'm going to go get him.

10:52.727 --> 10:56.181
It sounds like grandma's going full steam
ahead with this whole party-planning thing.

10:56.217 --> 10:56.891
I know!

10:56.926 --> 10:59.403
She's going to kill 400
cornish game hens --

10:59.435 --> 11:01.001
probably with her
own bare hands.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.471
Your grandfather just
had a heart attack.

11:02.505 --> 11:03.823
Your grandmother
is not drinking.

11:03.826 --> 11:07.750
This isn't exactly the ideal time to tell
them their only daughter's marriage is over.

11:07.788 --> 11:08.693
I know.

11:08.728 --> 11:10.420
I don't know what she'll do.
She's gone bananas.

11:10.456 --> 11:13.030
For all I know,
she'll throw a molotov mocktail at me.

11:13.066 --> 11:16.341
I know, but only you can
save the cornish game hens.

11:16.378 --> 11:18.571
Save the cornish game hens!

11:30.425 --> 11:32.682
Hey, hey! What are you doing?
Get back in bed.

11:32.715 --> 11:34.312
I just want to check
my e-mail real quick.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.491
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What's the big deal?

11:36.525 --> 11:39.791
I made you a special
birthday breakfast in bed,

11:39.828 --> 11:42.310
and if you don't go back to bed, it's
gonna be a special birthday breakfast

11:42.348 --> 11:44.233
at a desk, which is something
I have never heard of.

11:44.266 --> 11:45.272
Happy birthday.

11:45.748 --> 11:48.311
Now it is, now that there are
cinnamon buns in the picture.

11:48.345 --> 11:50.301
Are you impressed?
It's my specialty.

11:50.338 --> 11:51.830
I can cook anything
that comes in a tube.

11:51.867 --> 11:53.593
I am impressed and hungry.

11:53.967 --> 11:56.661
Get back in bed!
You are the birthday boy.

11:56.695 --> 11:58.940
You should not be working.
You should be luxuriating,

11:58.977 --> 12:01.343
eating peeled grapes and
being fanned with palm fronds.

12:01.375 --> 12:04.240
Peeled grapes? Well, what if the
birthday boy gets back in bed

12:04.276 --> 12:05.671
but is allowed to
bring his laptop?

12:05.696 --> 12:06.542
Deal.

12:06.646 --> 12:08.852
Somebody's pretty into
this whole birthday thing.

12:08.888 --> 12:13.243
If by "birthday thing," you mean the
celebration of the miracle of your birth,

12:13.278 --> 12:15.731
the anniversary of the day when
this world went from being

12:15.767 --> 12:18.993
a world without Logan Hunzberger
to a world with Logan Hunzberger,

12:19.028 --> 12:21.010
then, yes, I'm pretty into it.

12:21.048 --> 12:22.982
You really love me, don't you?

12:23.018 --> 12:23.953
You're okay.

12:23.986 --> 12:26.583
I'm not used to all this hoopla.
Birthdays aren't a very big deal

12:26.615 --> 12:28.350
- in the Hunzberger family.
- Why not?

12:28.385 --> 12:30.173
Because birthdays aren't
something you achieve.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.851
Why should you be lauded for
something that just happens to you?

12:32.887 --> 12:35.151
Didn't you have birthday
parties when you were a kid?

12:35.215 --> 12:36.760
They were parties, sort of,

12:36.798 --> 12:38.853
but not with any kids
I actually knew.

12:38.886 --> 12:40.063
That sounds like a blast.

12:40.098 --> 12:41.460
I never had a regular
birthday cake.

12:41.495 --> 12:44.353
I always wanted just a good old,
plain yellow cake, with frosting.

12:44.388 --> 12:47.260
But desserts were some fancy
flambé thing with alcohol.

12:47.295 --> 12:50.740
Well, those years of birthday
neglect will become a faint memory

12:50.777 --> 12:52.211
after the Gilmore treatment.

12:52.245 --> 12:54.453
Plenty of hoopla in a
Gilmore birthday, huh?

12:54.656 --> 12:57.332
Hoopla and then some.
My mom always went all out.

12:57.367 --> 12:59.210
- How's your mom doing?
- She's okay.

12:59.316 --> 13:00.350
And you?

13:00.838 --> 13:02.892
I feel like celebrating
your birthday.

13:04.416 --> 13:06.663
Why are you working?
It's your birthday.

13:06.695 --> 13:08.141
And I thought your deal
was already closed.

13:08.178 --> 13:09.131
It is.

13:09.267 --> 13:11.801
Then all that's left
to do is celebrate --

13:11.836 --> 13:14.860
and tell your dad, because you said
Hunzbergers celebrate achievement.

13:14.896 --> 13:17.142
Isn't closing this deal
a pretty big achievement?

13:17.178 --> 13:18.863
I don't want to tell my dad --
not yet.

13:18.897 --> 13:20.600
He can read about it in
the Wall Street journal,

13:20.638 --> 13:23.383
which in fact is what I just had
sent to me -- the press release.

13:23.416 --> 13:25.533
The press release, huh?
That's fancy.

13:25.567 --> 13:28.480
"Hunzberger, a young
visionary entrepreneur."

13:28.645 --> 13:29.851
Does that sound dorky?

13:29.887 --> 13:31.973
Nope. Sounds great.
It's exciting.

13:32.007 --> 13:33.643
- These are good, by the way.
- Good.

13:33.676 --> 13:36.620
But what would be great with them
is a nice bowl of peeled grapes.

13:36.656 --> 13:38.112
- Oh yeah?
- Would you make peeled grapes?

13:38.146 --> 13:39.792
If they come in a tube, I do.

13:43.426 --> 13:44.142
Hello?

13:44.177 --> 13:45.261
- Lorelai?
- Mom?

13:45.298 --> 13:47.112
- They won't deliver.
- Deliver what?

13:47.148 --> 13:49.313
And, apparently, none of their
help has driver's licenses.

13:49.347 --> 13:51.390
That's a little irresponsible,
don't you think?

13:51.425 --> 13:53.413
You got to help me out
a little here, mom.

13:54.205 --> 13:55.372
Why are you leering at me?

13:55.406 --> 13:57.163
Mother, are you on peyote?

13:57.195 --> 13:59.453
Mr. Gilmore's light
bulb is bothering him.

13:59.485 --> 14:01.440
I'm sorry --
it's that some sort of nurse code?

14:01.478 --> 14:03.822
The 60-watt bulb on
his bedside lamp

14:03.855 --> 14:06.910
is apparently casting a harsh
glare on the television.

14:06.948 --> 14:08.571
Well, then,
get him another light bulb.

14:08.608 --> 14:09.960
It's just not my job.

14:09.997 --> 14:12.541
- Then get Francette to do it.
- I am Francette.

14:12.578 --> 14:14.343
- Mom.
- Aurora is the maid.

14:14.376 --> 14:17.082
Then ask Aurora to
find a light bulb.

14:17.118 --> 14:19.261
- I can't find Aurora.
- You can't find Aurora?

14:19.298 --> 14:21.143
She's hiding from Mr. Gilmore.

14:21.178 --> 14:23.213
- Hello?
- She's hiding from --

14:23.246 --> 14:26.261
Never mind. I'll get it myself.
Honestly -- these people!

14:26.295 --> 14:27.631
Mother, what is
going on over there?

14:27.665 --> 14:30.001
Your father is running
low on his blood thinners,

14:30.038 --> 14:32.143
and the pharmacy can't
be bothered to deliver.

14:32.178 --> 14:35.292
Are you calling to ask me if I
will pick up dad's prescription?

14:35.326 --> 14:37.920
Well, I can't leave the house,
or chaos will ensue.

14:37.955 --> 14:39.943
You're calling to imply that
you would like to ask me

14:39.976 --> 14:41.161
to pick up dad's prescription ?

14:41.195 --> 14:44.971
It's a pharmacy at the corner
of Walden and Hasbrook lane.

14:45.425 --> 14:46.483
Okay--

14:46.777 --> 14:47.813
Hello?

14:48.205 --> 14:50.983
No, it's no problem at all.
I'd be happy to.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.423
It's just nice to
be appreciated.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.590
By the way,
Chris and I broke up. Bye.

14:57.946 --> 15:00.680
Yeah, it's true --
he's definitely moved out.

15:00.718 --> 15:04.030
Last time I saw the...
beagle's car in the driveway,

15:04.067 --> 15:05.040
it was days ago.

15:05.077 --> 15:06.423
Then I saw the mover's truck,

15:06.455 --> 15:09.403
so only the...
hen is living there now.

15:09.438 --> 15:12.190
Did the hen break up with the beagle,
or the beagle with the hen?

15:12.226 --> 15:13.353
I don't know.

15:13.388 --> 15:14.603
The poor hen.

15:14.635 --> 15:16.380
She's been through so much.

15:16.415 --> 15:19.343
You know, just kind of getting
used to him -- the beagle.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.612
But he's not right for her.
He's a beagle, you know.

15:21.647 --> 15:24.102
And beagles belong
with beagles.

15:24.135 --> 15:26.500
And the hen belongs
with the rooster.

15:26.537 --> 15:27.393
Maybe.

15:27.425 --> 15:30.152
Well, does the rooster know
about the hen and the beagle?

15:30.208 --> 15:33.442
Oh, yeah, east side Tillie was in here
yesterday, blabbing her big mouth off.

15:33.475 --> 15:36.090
How did he take it?
Did you see his face?

15:36.126 --> 15:37.821
Yeah, but you know the rooster.

15:37.856 --> 15:40.551
It's like looking at stonehenge.
I don't know what he thinks.

15:40.586 --> 15:43.952
I hope he gets his act together
because I think they're perfect.

15:43.985 --> 15:48.112
Yeah, but maybe sh--
the hen belongs with someone else...

15:48.346 --> 15:50.563
like a penguin or an ostrich.

15:50.597 --> 15:52.913
I can no longer sit here
and listen to this.

15:52.945 --> 15:54.511
Oh, good. Go sit over there.

15:54.547 --> 15:58.891
I'm sorry, but I can't in good conscience
let this perverse conversation continue.

15:58.927 --> 16:02.083
Are you insinuating that a hen
could mate with an ostrich?

16:02.116 --> 16:05.362
Because even ignoring the question
of biological feasibility,

16:05.396 --> 16:07.630
it's completely
morally reprehensible.

16:07.665 --> 16:10.050
Oh, buzz off with your
"morally reprehensible."

16:10.085 --> 16:11.861
How do you expect her
to lay those eggs?

16:11.898 --> 16:13.590
Have you thought about that,
have you?

16:14.155 --> 16:16.993
- Hey, big brother!
- Surprise!

16:17.026 --> 16:20.851
Yes, Liz, T.J., jeez,
and piles of your belongings.

16:20.888 --> 16:22.470
It's so good to see you.

16:22.506 --> 16:24.273
Yeah, you, too. Hey, Doula.

16:24.306 --> 16:25.773
- She looks good, huh?
- Yeah.

16:25.808 --> 16:28.681
Sturdy, too,
like she might be a female wrestler.

16:28.717 --> 16:30.130
- Oh, fingers crossed.
- Right.

16:30.165 --> 16:32.232
You know what I'm thinking?
Free tickets.

16:32.267 --> 16:34.760
So you two just decided
to swing by the diner

16:34.798 --> 16:38.592
with a half a dozen bags and
a baby apparatus of some kind?

16:38.627 --> 16:41.360
No, we decided to come
and keep you company.

16:41.396 --> 16:42.360
- Company?
- Yeah.

16:42.398 --> 16:44.492
Now that April's in New Mexico,
we figured

16:44.527 --> 16:46.451
you might be getting
a little lonely.

16:46.488 --> 16:47.962
No, I'm not getting lonely.

16:47.995 --> 16:50.542
I miss having
April around, sure,

16:50.578 --> 16:52.883
but I talk to her every
wednesday after swim practice

16:52.915 --> 16:55.020
and every sunday if she's
done all her homework.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.463
It's going good.

16:56.495 --> 16:58.700
Are you buying this?
I'm not buying it.

16:58.736 --> 17:00.311
Buying what?
There's nothing to buy.

17:00.346 --> 17:01.911
Hey, where are you going?

17:01.946 --> 17:04.300
Oh, don't do the
stiff-upper-lip thing with us.

17:04.337 --> 17:06.313
We're family.
We're here for you.

17:06.345 --> 17:10.182
Look, Liz, it's really sweet of
you to come by and visit, but --

17:11.517 --> 17:13.432
You're planning on
staying here for a while?

17:13.464 --> 17:14.700
We don't want you to be lonely.

17:14.727 --> 17:17.422
How long exactly are you
planning on keeping me company?

17:17.454 --> 17:19.211
A few days, a week tops.

17:19.248 --> 17:20.963
I don't need to
be kept company.

17:21.494 --> 17:23.290
Yeah, but you --

17:24.305 --> 17:25.472
We should just come clean.

17:25.505 --> 17:26.921
- No.
- Yes. About what?

17:26.955 --> 17:28.153
- About nothing.
- T.J.

17:28.186 --> 17:30.890
How about them celtics, huh?
They sure can dribble a basketball.

17:30.928 --> 17:32.270
- Liz...
- We got moths.

17:32.308 --> 17:34.332
- I'm sorry?
- Oh, me too, believe me.

17:34.365 --> 17:37.613
Luke, it's horrible. I hate those
little floppy, fluttery jerks.

17:37.646 --> 17:38.820
Moths, huh?

17:38.858 --> 17:42.100
Dude, they're everywhere -- flying around,
popping out of the flour container,

17:42.136 --> 17:45.702
congregating around the light bulbs,
all pasty and white.

17:45.738 --> 17:48.163
I swear,
moths are like the loser butterflies

17:48.198 --> 17:50.862
that couldn't get laid if they
tied a $100 bill to their --

17:50.898 --> 17:52.502
T.J., I got it. You got moths.

17:52.536 --> 17:55.001
So we figured we
could avoid the moths

17:55.037 --> 17:57.771
and have a little
quality time with you.

17:57.807 --> 18:02.701
Yeah, all right, just go ahead upstairs,
make yourselves at home.

18:02.735 --> 18:03.753
Love it!

18:13.818 --> 18:16.172
It's miso, Richard.
It's good for you.

18:16.206 --> 18:17.260
Soup.

18:17.828 --> 18:20.021
Stefan! Stefan!

18:20.055 --> 18:22.892
Soup is not a meal,
nor is a salad.

18:22.925 --> 18:26.323
Soup and salad are either
precursors to a meal or addenda.

18:26.357 --> 18:27.733
Richard, please.

18:27.936 --> 18:29.833
Soup and salad is not a meal.

18:29.867 --> 18:31.782
We have salmon if
you want salmon.

18:31.817 --> 18:34.470
I don't want salmon.
For heaven's sakes, I don't want salmon.

18:34.506 --> 18:37.200
What I would like
is a proper meal.

18:37.738 --> 18:39.500
Aurora, the door!

18:39.537 --> 18:42.203
I was given certain
dietary parameters.

18:42.236 --> 18:43.782
I know that. I'm not stupid.

18:43.816 --> 18:45.783
I know what the
situation is here.

18:46.247 --> 18:48.433
- I just don't know --
- Francette, Aurora,

18:48.467 --> 18:51.442
either of you, both of you,
will someone answer the door?!

18:51.476 --> 18:54.001
I'm sure Stefan is interested
in your input, Richard.

18:54.037 --> 18:56.581
Here's my input --
this food is inedible.

18:57.188 --> 19:00.503
Fine, I'll get it myself,
not that it's my job.

19:01.546 --> 19:04.783
A suggestion -- maybe you would
prefer some light sandwiches.

19:04.817 --> 19:06.012
Sandwiches?!

19:06.397 --> 19:07.900
Hi. I come bearing drugs.

19:07.937 --> 19:08.932
Please don't bellow that.

19:08.946 --> 19:10.160
Bellow what -- "drugs"?!

19:10.196 --> 19:11.850
- Lorelai.
- How's dad doing?

19:11.888 --> 19:12.931
He's just fine.

19:12.968 --> 19:15.712
I swear you can get better
food in an airplane.

19:15.746 --> 19:17.233
I haven't been in a submarine,

19:17.266 --> 19:19.473
but I'll wager the food
is better there, too.

19:19.618 --> 19:20.990
It's an adjustment.

19:21.735 --> 19:23.681
Let me offer one
more suggestion.

19:23.716 --> 19:24.872
What -- tacos?

19:24.908 --> 19:26.233
No. I quit!

19:26.267 --> 19:28.253
- Fine.
- Stefan, no!

19:28.506 --> 19:30.000
I'll tell you something.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.562
I have worked in so many
four-star restaurants,

19:32.595 --> 19:34.562
I could have my
own constellation.

19:34.597 --> 19:36.682
And yet,
I'm treated like this?!

19:36.715 --> 19:39.640
I'm sorry,
but I have too much self-respect

19:39.677 --> 19:41.772
to work for this... terror!

19:46.537 --> 19:47.960
How are things
going around here?

19:47.996 --> 19:49.110
- Fine.
- Fine.

19:49.145 --> 19:50.342
Feeling okay, dad?

19:50.376 --> 19:51.443
I'm fine.

19:51.477 --> 19:52.820
Now, if you'll excuse me,

19:52.855 --> 19:56.063
I think I'm going to go watch
Bob Tway vanquish Greg Norman

19:56.098 --> 19:57.991
in the '86 PGA championship.

19:58.028 --> 20:00.823
Before you go, did you managed
to call Rob Mandel's office?

20:00.858 --> 20:01.590
No.

20:01.627 --> 20:03.720
But Angelique called
three times this morning.

20:03.758 --> 20:06.241
Bully for her. I'm sorry.
I have golf to watch.

20:06.276 --> 20:08.200
But, Richard,
you didn't eat a thing.

20:08.725 --> 20:09.900
He didn't eat a thing.

20:09.937 --> 20:11.213
Mom, send something up to him.

20:11.248 --> 20:13.442
Send what? You saw yourself --
Stefan just quit.

20:13.476 --> 20:14.752
You could make him something.

20:14.786 --> 20:17.311
I mean, the maid could --
what is her name?

20:17.346 --> 20:20.250
Oh, I don't know.
Aurora, I think. I don't know.

20:20.285 --> 20:22.320
Anyway, she's
hiding, apparently.

20:22.395 --> 20:23.823
Aurora?

20:24.327 --> 20:26.931
Aurora? Where are you?

20:26.968 --> 20:28.283
The maid is hiding?

20:28.318 --> 20:30.433
According to the nurse,
but she's useless

20:30.465 --> 20:32.923
because she won't do anything that
doesn't involve a stethoscope.

20:32.955 --> 20:34.783
- I can make something for dad.
- Oh, please.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.943
I can make toast,
if the conditions are ideal.

20:36.975 --> 20:38.950
He won't eat it, anyway.
He'll just snap at me,

20:38.986 --> 20:40.510
snapping at everyone in sight.

20:40.547 --> 20:43.562
The poor maid quivers every time he
comes near her. She just quivers.

20:43.598 --> 20:44.651
It's terrible.

20:44.688 --> 20:46.803
And his accountant's office keeps
calling because he's supposed

20:46.838 --> 20:49.962
to be filing an 1120.
Who knows what an 1120 is?

20:49.996 --> 20:51.653
I do. It's a federal tax form.

20:51.686 --> 20:53.072
Aurora!

20:53.365 --> 20:55.802
He won't call them back.
All he wants to do is watch golf.

20:55.837 --> 20:57.680
- What's with all the golf?
- I have no idea.

20:57.717 --> 21:00.430
He just lies there in bed,
staring at the TV like a zombie.

21:00.466 --> 21:02.253
Everything is falling apart.
Everything is chaotic.

21:02.286 --> 21:07.322
Mom, please, sit down. I'm gonna
make you a delicious mocktail, huh?

21:07.358 --> 21:10.213
And then you enjoy
that and relax

21:10.248 --> 21:13.612
and I'll take care of the chef and I'll
make sure that dad takes his medicine

21:13.647 --> 21:15.362
so you don't have
to worry. Here.

21:15.396 --> 21:19.520
Thank you. But I'm going to call
Angelique and ask about this 1120.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.230
I'll find Aurora.

21:22.905 --> 21:24.600
Aurora!

21:25.307 --> 21:28.160
To heat most of these up,
you just zap them for a couple minutes.

21:28.218 --> 21:31.763
Don't worry. Each meal has a note with
cooking instructions taped to it.

21:31.797 --> 21:33.341
Did I already tell
you you're a goddess?

21:33.375 --> 21:35.450
You might have mentioned
something to that effect.

21:35.487 --> 21:36.763
Could I be the one
with the multiarms?

21:36.796 --> 21:37.513
The who?

21:37.546 --> 21:39.291
The goddess with all these arms.
I want to be her.

21:39.327 --> 21:40.930
Sure. Hey, these look good.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.732
Don't sound so surprised.

21:42.768 --> 21:45.260
Yeah, but they're supposed to be
healthy, right? They are all healthy?

21:45.298 --> 21:46.953
They're ridiculously healthy.

21:47.285 --> 21:48.761
- Hey!
- Hey.

21:48.795 --> 21:50.471
What did we do for
my 8th birthday?

21:50.505 --> 21:53.570
I don't know. Is this a quiz?
Are you on some sort of radio contest?

21:53.605 --> 21:55.622
For Logan's birthday,
I'm trying to put together

21:55.658 --> 21:57.910
a night of all the birthday
highlights that he missed.

21:57.947 --> 21:59.702
And you're looking
for the classics?

21:59.735 --> 22:00.730
Exactly.

22:00.768 --> 22:04.111
I remember that we had an
outer-space birthday when I turned 6.

22:04.145 --> 22:06.761
Right. We made space
suits out of garbage bags.

22:06.796 --> 22:08.641
We had tang and
freeze-dried ice cream.

22:08.676 --> 22:11.822
And then when I turned 7,
we did a fiesta birthday.

22:11.978 --> 22:14.403
Piñatas and tacos and
freeze-dried ice cream.

22:14.438 --> 22:16.070
Freeze-dried ice
cream is the best.

22:16.106 --> 22:19.170
I remember enjoying my 8th birthday.
I just don't remember what it was.

22:19.206 --> 22:21.693
- Teddy-bear tea party.
- Oh, that's right.

22:21.728 --> 22:23.363
- So, how's it going over there?
- I'd say weirder.

22:23.396 --> 22:25.443
Your grandma's a
little on edge.

22:27.256 --> 22:29.803
Oh, hey, mom, it's Logan on the
other line. Can you hold on a sec?

22:29.835 --> 22:31.080
Tell him "happy
birthday" for me.

22:31.115 --> 22:32.163
Will do.

22:32.688 --> 22:34.692
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

22:34.725 --> 22:36.140
And happy birthday from my mom.

22:36.175 --> 22:37.202
Thank you.

22:37.237 --> 22:38.781
Hey, so my dad just called.

22:38.816 --> 22:39.700
Oh, he did?

22:39.738 --> 22:41.550
Yeah. Apparently,
he remembered my birthday,

22:41.586 --> 22:43.753
and he said he wants to take
us out to dinner, you and me.

22:43.788 --> 22:45.602
Oh. That's... great.

22:45.637 --> 22:49.572
I know it's last minute, and I know you
got your special Gilmore hoopla planned,

22:49.605 --> 22:50.990
so we don't have to go
if you don't want to go.

22:51.026 --> 22:53.841
No, we should go.
We can always do the Gilmore hoopla

22:53.875 --> 22:55.201
after we have dinner
with your dad.

22:55.237 --> 22:57.062
Are you sure? It'll probably be lame.
For all I know,

22:57.095 --> 22:59.040
he's invited us to crash a
meeting with Rupert Murdoch.

22:59.077 --> 23:01.201
That's cool.
I can hang with mad dog Murdoch.

23:01.235 --> 23:04.042
Okay. Well, cool, cool.
Thanks, Ace. I'll call him back.

23:04.075 --> 23:05.780
- Happy birthday!
- Bye!

23:06.797 --> 23:08.070
Hey, sorry about that.

23:08.108 --> 23:10.992
- How's the birthday boy?
- He's good. He's fine.

23:11.027 --> 23:13.451
But I guess his dad called
and wants to take us out

23:13.485 --> 23:14.850
to a birthday dinner tonight.

23:14.886 --> 23:16.550
That sounds like
a load of laughs.

23:16.587 --> 23:19.993
Yeah. Mitchum --
that man is fundamentally incapable

23:20.028 --> 23:23.033
of making me feel anything
but small and awful.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.582
That's not true.
He's made you feel incompetent, too.

23:25.615 --> 23:28.332
I guess Logan was excited that
his dad wanted to take us out,

23:28.365 --> 23:29.580
so that's sweet.

23:30.005 --> 23:33.290
Have you told grandma and
grandpa about you and dad yet?

23:33.325 --> 23:34.670
Um, not yet.

23:34.706 --> 23:38.590
I feel obligated to remind you that
the lives of 400 cornish game hens

23:38.626 --> 23:39.632
hang in the balance.

23:39.665 --> 23:40.803
Happy Logan's birthday.

23:40.835 --> 23:42.110
Happy Logan's birthday to you.

23:42.147 --> 23:43.193
Bye.

23:43.226 --> 23:45.421
Mmm, that looks unhealthy.

23:45.455 --> 23:46.931
Thank you.

23:48.997 --> 23:50.810
Oh, I love this song.

23:50.848 --> 23:53.042
I don't know why we didn't
think of this before.

23:53.077 --> 23:53.832
Think of what?

23:53.868 --> 23:57.473
Using your fishing line for stringing --
it's really incredible.

23:57.506 --> 23:59.800
Durable yet plenty
thin and flexible.

23:59.837 --> 24:00.613
I'm glad.

24:00.646 --> 24:03.360
And some of this doohickeys,
man, are really cute.

24:03.395 --> 24:05.210
Check it out -- sexy, yeah?

24:05.246 --> 24:07.622
Oh, wow, babe,
these are gorgeous.

24:07.657 --> 24:08.500
Thank you, sweetie.

24:08.538 --> 24:10.583
I'm so proud of
your sister, Luke.

24:10.616 --> 24:13.142
This jewelry stuff has really taken off,
you know?

24:13.175 --> 24:16.101
And it's great because now I
can be the stay-at-home dad

24:16.137 --> 24:17.622
I've always dreamed of being

24:17.655 --> 24:20.190
while this one goes out
and brings home the bacon.

24:20.226 --> 24:22.290
We're gonna drive our
new van from trade show

24:22.328 --> 24:23.962
to trade show,
selling the jewelry.

24:23.998 --> 24:26.822
In a couple weeks,
there's this big show in Manhattan.

24:26.855 --> 24:28.052
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

24:28.086 --> 24:29.370
At the Javits Center.

24:29.407 --> 24:31.480
We'll just load up the van,
head up 91,

24:31.518 --> 24:33.663
and start showing off
the family jewels.

24:33.696 --> 24:36.883
That sounds good. I wouldn't
take the 91 through New Haven.

24:36.917 --> 24:39.121
There's tons of construction there now.
I'd take the Merritt.

24:39.158 --> 24:40.640
How do you know
there's construction?

24:40.677 --> 24:43.792
'Cause I went there to visit Lorelai's
dad when he had the heart attack.

24:43.827 --> 24:46.533
- You did?
- I thought I told you that.

24:46.565 --> 24:48.441
No, you told me he
had a heart attack.

24:48.477 --> 24:50.860
You didn't tell me you
went to the hospital.

24:50.897 --> 24:52.473
What's the big deal?

24:52.965 --> 24:56.621
I don't know.
I mean, you went there for Lorelai,

24:56.655 --> 24:58.471
and what's going on with
her and her husband?

24:58.505 --> 25:01.511
I don't know.
They split up or something.

25:01.546 --> 25:02.540
They did?

25:02.576 --> 25:04.551
Yeah, well, a week or so ago.

25:04.676 --> 25:06.581
Well, well, well.

25:07.016 --> 25:09.001
- What?
- The plot thickens.

25:09.038 --> 25:11.550
The plot does not
thicken, okay?

25:11.585 --> 25:13.462
We're friends -- that's all.

25:13.495 --> 25:15.983
I just went out when I heard
her dad was sick. That's it.

25:16.016 --> 25:18.503
- That is a relief.
- T.J.!

25:18.536 --> 25:20.832
What? It's a load off my mind.
That's all I'm saying.

25:20.865 --> 25:23.183
'Cause I don't think you should
get back together with her.

25:23.217 --> 25:25.343
Nobody's talking about getting
back together with her.

25:25.375 --> 25:27.781
Good. 'Cause that woman is drama.
Every time you mention her,

25:27.815 --> 25:29.531
it's got something to
do with the hospital.

25:29.567 --> 25:31.483
- What?
- How's her dad doing?

25:31.515 --> 25:32.723
Good, I guess.

25:32.755 --> 25:34.333
You haven't called Lorelai?

25:34.367 --> 25:35.203
No.

25:35.237 --> 25:38.091
Don't call her.
Don't open that Pandora's box.

25:38.125 --> 25:40.990
If he wants to call her,
he should call her -- they're friends.

25:41.026 --> 25:42.671
Just lock it up, Luke.

25:42.705 --> 25:43.802
Lock it up.

25:43.837 --> 25:46.181
Solder that baby shut.

25:47.846 --> 25:49.141
Would you follow me, please?

25:49.175 --> 25:51.233
Mr. Hunzberger is
already at the table.

25:51.266 --> 25:52.903
"Mr. Hunzberger is
already at the table."

25:52.936 --> 25:54.110
I told you.

25:54.368 --> 25:55.661
There they are.

25:55.697 --> 25:56.932
Happy birthday, Logan.

25:56.966 --> 25:58.480
- Rory.
- Hi.

25:58.518 --> 26:00.103
- Great to see you.
- You too.

26:00.135 --> 26:01.283
Sit, sit.

26:01.345 --> 26:04.020
I took the liberty of ordering a
bottle of champagne for the table.

26:04.038 --> 26:04.992
Oh, nice.

26:05.025 --> 26:06.033
Rory, how does that sound?

26:06.068 --> 26:07.593
Sounds like music to my ears.

26:07.627 --> 26:08.731
Good, good.

26:08.765 --> 26:10.681
So, you look pretty good.

26:10.715 --> 26:12.390
You been hitting the
squash courts lately?

26:12.416 --> 26:15.151
I wish. I haven't had much of a chance.
I've been working pretty much nonstop

26:15.185 --> 26:16.553
- these days.
- He has been.

26:16.585 --> 26:17.630
Well, good for you.

26:17.668 --> 26:19.423
A little hard work
never hurt anybody.

26:20.556 --> 26:23.921
To my son --
now a quarter of a century old.

26:23.955 --> 26:26.303
Not bad.
And to his lovely girlfriend --

26:26.338 --> 26:28.802
the beautiful and
always witty Rory.

26:28.835 --> 26:30.111
Hear, hear.

26:32.455 --> 26:35.473
Here's a little amuse-bouche
with avocado and crabmeat,

26:35.505 --> 26:36.782
compliments of the chef.

26:36.818 --> 26:38.391
Oh, tell Markham thanks.

26:38.426 --> 26:39.781
You know the chef here?

26:39.817 --> 26:41.401
Yeah, I've known him for...

26:41.436 --> 26:44.353
wow... almost 15 years now.

26:44.616 --> 26:46.290
Interesting story, actually --

26:46.326 --> 26:49.731
he was the sous chef at Le
Bernardin for a bunch of years.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.700
Mmm... that's good.

26:53.845 --> 26:55.081
That's good crab.

26:55.115 --> 26:57.721
Anyway, one day,
he just quit --

26:57.755 --> 26:59.211
said he wanted to start
his own restaurant.

26:59.247 --> 27:00.860
Everyone thought it was
a bad idea at the time.

27:00.896 --> 27:01.981
The odds were against him.

27:02.017 --> 27:04.462
Opening a successful
restaurant in Manhattan

27:04.646 --> 27:07.033
is like catching a
firefly in your hand,

27:07.065 --> 27:08.602
only a hell of a
lot more expensive.

27:08.637 --> 27:10.793
All I can tell you is that
this amuse-bouche is great.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.671
Yes, my mouth is very amused.

27:13.566 --> 27:14.640
That's funny.

27:14.886 --> 27:16.582
But it was a very gutsy move.

27:16.616 --> 27:17.641
And it paid off.

27:17.676 --> 27:18.881
He caught that firefly.

27:18.916 --> 27:20.023
Exactly.

27:20.056 --> 27:23.651
So, Rory, tell me -- are you still
planning to pursue journalism?

27:23.686 --> 27:28.500
Yes, I have been writing some
articles for an online magazine

27:28.536 --> 27:32.353
and I've just applied for the
James Reston reporting fellowship.

27:32.388 --> 27:33.612
You know what you should read?

27:33.648 --> 27:35.880
- Philip Meyer's latest book --
- "The vanishing newspaper."

27:35.918 --> 27:37.181
I read it. I loved it.

27:37.218 --> 27:38.981
It's an interesting
time in journalism.

27:39.016 --> 27:40.850
I'll tell you what
our field needs --

27:41.028 --> 27:44.162
an infusion of bright,
talented people like you, Rory.

27:44.196 --> 27:45.801
- Thank you.
- I mean it.

27:47.535 --> 27:50.023
So, dad took his medicine.
He ate half of Sookie's chicken

27:50.057 --> 27:52.371
and the entire mango smoothie.
I got three recommendations

27:52.398 --> 27:55.650
of personal chefs from Sookie,
two of them I've spoken to on the phone.

27:56.015 --> 27:57.701
Thank you.
Why are you doing all this?

27:57.737 --> 27:59.742
I'm trying to help, mom.
I don't want you to be so stressed.

27:59.777 --> 28:02.733
But I am. I'm so stressed.
I can't find anything.

28:02.765 --> 28:03.763
What are you looking for?

28:03.775 --> 28:06.500
Your father's accountant
wants all sorts of information

28:06.535 --> 28:09.361
so he can file these taxes,
which are apparently due in february.

28:09.398 --> 28:11.512
- Maybe I can help.
- How can you help?

28:11.648 --> 28:14.423
Mom, I have a business.
I helped dad set up this business.

28:14.458 --> 28:15.862
I went to business school.

28:15.897 --> 28:17.050
Let me see that.

28:17.495 --> 28:18.682
What are you doing?

28:18.717 --> 28:20.911
Don't touch the computer.
You could mess something up.

28:20.947 --> 28:22.883
Don't worry, mom.
I know what I'm doing.

28:22.915 --> 28:26.780
Okay, so he's using Quicken.
A profit and loss statement,

28:26.818 --> 28:29.500
a balance sheet, a schedule asset,
are all things I can pull up here.

28:29.537 --> 28:31.852
We can just e-mail them to the
accountant for the 1120.

28:31.888 --> 28:33.422
How do you know about 1120s?

28:33.456 --> 28:35.152
I have to file
them for the Inn.

28:35.185 --> 28:37.101
The Inn's a corporation
just like dad's company.

28:37.137 --> 28:38.862
Why is everything
a corporation?

28:38.897 --> 28:41.781
We incorporated so we were
protected from personal liability.

28:41.818 --> 28:44.593
If someone was allergic to pillow
mints and wanted to sue me

28:44.627 --> 28:46.891
for a million dollars, I wouldn't have
to pay for it out of my own pocket.

28:46.925 --> 28:49.182
Your father and I don't have
anyone who wants to sue us.

28:49.216 --> 28:51.381
Well, dad probably did
it for tax purposes.

28:51.415 --> 28:54.532
It looks like he's got a couple
of different investments,

28:54.566 --> 28:56.270
some stocks, a rental building.

28:56.815 --> 28:58.162
Would you like a drink?

28:58.348 --> 29:01.122
Mmm, I thought
the house was dry.

29:01.775 --> 29:02.781
Vodka or scotch?

29:02.816 --> 29:04.630
Wow, it's a regular speakeasy.

29:04.666 --> 29:06.082
Would you like a drink or not?

29:06.116 --> 29:07.060
Vodka, please.

29:07.096 --> 29:08.620
I have glasses.

29:10.156 --> 29:11.682
Serve yourself.

29:12.465 --> 29:14.343
Just because your
father can't drink

29:14.376 --> 29:16.310
doesn't mean the rest
of us should suffer.

29:18.178 --> 29:19.263
Cheers.

29:22.988 --> 29:25.190
Ah! That's better.

29:26.407 --> 29:28.343
Mom, Christopher
and I split up.

29:32.096 --> 29:33.092
Okay.

29:36.465 --> 29:39.621
- I hardly know what to say.
- Really? That's great.

29:39.656 --> 29:42.222
You don't have to say anything at all --
now or ever.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.330
What's a windmill park?

29:46.368 --> 29:50.791
Uh, it looks like dad owns a couple
of windmills in Palm Springs.

29:50.825 --> 29:52.183
We own windmills?

29:52.218 --> 29:53.841
They're energy generators.

29:54.336 --> 29:56.683
I had no idea we
owned windmills.

30:00.447 --> 30:01.493
That lamb is terrific.

30:01.525 --> 30:03.241
My compliments to the your friend,
the chef.

30:03.277 --> 30:06.121
Well, you're a good orderer.
He's always been a good orderer.

30:06.158 --> 30:09.021
Even when he was 8 years old,
he's always ordered well.

30:09.055 --> 30:11.002
- It's a good skill to have.
- It is, it is.

30:11.037 --> 30:13.081
And you know what I should do? I should
just order whatever you're ordering,

30:13.118 --> 30:15.061
- no matter what it is.
- Brains it is,

30:15.097 --> 30:17.623
followed by sweetbreads and
some rocky mountain oysters.

30:17.707 --> 30:19.951
Oh, this is a business thing,
if you guys don't mind.

30:19.987 --> 30:21.140
Hunzberger here.

30:21.175 --> 30:22.630
No, I haven't
talked to him yet.

30:22.666 --> 30:24.040
"Hunzberger here."

30:24.076 --> 30:26.161
Last year,
if he got a call interrupting dinner,

30:26.197 --> 30:28.352
it would be an invitation to
go drink expensive liquor

30:28.385 --> 30:30.301
and pull some ridiculous prank.

30:30.435 --> 30:31.620
He's growing up.

30:31.656 --> 30:33.061
Yeah, he's doing really great.

30:33.096 --> 30:35.352
He is, and it's because of you.

30:35.485 --> 30:37.401
Oh, I don't know about that.

30:37.435 --> 30:39.832
No, I know you encouraged
him to go to London.

30:39.866 --> 30:43.401
I know you used your influence in a
positive way, and Logan's mother and I...

30:43.437 --> 30:44.580
really appreciate it.

30:44.617 --> 30:48.293
Well, I think Logan deserves all
the credit for what he's done.

30:48.327 --> 30:50.303
No, you're too modest, Rory.

30:50.336 --> 30:52.912
You've been a real asset to
Logan and to our family.

30:52.946 --> 30:55.010
Oh, well... thanks.

30:55.045 --> 30:57.663
I know we've had our
differences in the past.

30:57.808 --> 30:58.393
Yeah.

30:58.425 --> 31:02.822
But I'm glad to know that we're
now clearly on the same page.

31:03.458 --> 31:06.363
Okay, yeah. Good.

31:06.565 --> 31:08.102
To being on the same page?

31:08.137 --> 31:10.050
To being on the same page.

31:14.535 --> 31:17.192
I am really glad we got
the chance to talk tonight.

31:17.228 --> 31:19.252
In part,
because we still have more work to do.

31:19.287 --> 31:20.202
What work?

31:20.238 --> 31:22.811
We have to figure out what
his next step should be.

31:23.065 --> 31:25.461
Uh, well,
shouldn't he be figuring that out?

31:25.497 --> 31:26.890
Well, you're part
of the team here.

31:26.907 --> 31:28.832
Of course,
we're gonna take care of you, too.

31:28.887 --> 31:29.840
What do you mean?

31:29.878 --> 31:31.791
We have newspapers
all around the world.

31:31.827 --> 31:33.212
You can take your pick.

31:33.247 --> 31:34.481
My pick?

31:35.418 --> 31:40.190
Um, I seem to remember you
saying that I didn't have it.

31:40.225 --> 31:42.291
Oh, please. Things change.

31:42.805 --> 31:44.273
Circumstances change.

31:44.305 --> 31:46.142
Sorry that took so long.
Have you ever noticed

31:46.165 --> 31:47.930
that people in Hong
Kong are really chatty?

31:47.965 --> 31:48.983
I haven't.

31:49.016 --> 31:51.892
You know what? That's true.
I know a guy from Kowloon, and, man,

31:51.926 --> 31:54.362
is he a loquacious son of a bitch.
Oh, here we go.

31:54.398 --> 31:56.113
Apricot and walnut varénikis

31:56.145 --> 31:58.071
drizzled with a
raspberry reduction.

31:58.106 --> 32:00.612
I told them to make something
special for your birthday.

32:00.647 --> 32:01.791
Thanks. It looks great.

32:01.826 --> 32:03.092
Happy birthday.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.511
Make a wish.

32:05.406 --> 32:06.822
There we go.

32:10.625 --> 32:13.102
Hey. It's your turn.

32:13.136 --> 32:16.582
Hey, aren't we supposed to let her just
cry to toughen her up and whatnot?

32:16.615 --> 32:18.720
Isn't that the latest
parenting theory?

32:18.756 --> 32:21.143
You only believe in that
theory when it's your turn.

32:21.178 --> 32:22.531
All right, all right.

32:22.936 --> 32:25.031
I just don't want
her getting too soft.

32:25.067 --> 32:27.212
She's got a wrestling
future to think of.

32:27.377 --> 32:29.002
Hey, there, little girl.

32:29.357 --> 32:30.481
How are you?

32:32.067 --> 32:33.550
How are you?

32:35.927 --> 32:37.743
Do you think Luke is lonely?

32:37.805 --> 32:38.992
I mean for real.

32:39.287 --> 32:41.970
He does look a little
lonely around the eyes.

32:42.005 --> 32:43.872
I think he's lovesick
over Lorelai.

32:43.907 --> 32:45.121
Oh, boy.

32:45.158 --> 32:46.742
T.J., I'm serious.

32:46.777 --> 32:49.472
I just think that he might
be better off lonely.

32:49.508 --> 32:51.193
I think they belong together.

32:51.227 --> 32:53.311
That's not what you said
when they broke up.

32:53.347 --> 32:55.852
I always thought what you said
then made a lot of sense,

32:55.886 --> 33:00.201
about them being in two different
space-time continuums, something like that.

33:00.236 --> 33:01.902
It's all about the wormholes.

33:01.936 --> 33:03.452
Between the dimensions?

33:03.488 --> 33:06.110
Yep, all they've got to do
is find the right wormhole.

33:06.766 --> 33:08.083
I don't know.

33:14.407 --> 33:18.702
So, if you want to access your bank and
credit-card account information, you...?

33:19.085 --> 33:20.382
Click "cashflow center."

33:20.417 --> 33:23.452
Yes, and if you want to
see any of these menus,

33:23.488 --> 33:27.101
you right-click right... yes.

33:27.308 --> 33:30.561
And if I want the
hidden account bar,

33:30.598 --> 33:33.643
I double-click that arrow
thing up there on the left.

33:33.677 --> 33:35.353
Mom, exactly.

33:37.345 --> 33:39.210
I don't know how I'm
gonna do all this.

33:39.245 --> 33:41.863
Mom, what are you talking about?
You just click, click, click.

33:41.897 --> 33:43.030
You got it all down.

33:43.068 --> 33:45.560
Now, but I barely understand
what you've been telling me.

33:45.598 --> 33:47.093
This is your father's job.

33:47.128 --> 33:49.511
Well, he'll be back on
the job soon enough.

33:49.548 --> 33:51.830
I don't know. Have you seen him?
He's wearing a dressing gown.

33:51.866 --> 33:53.462
I know.
He's watching TV in the bedroom.

33:53.477 --> 33:55.262
I know, mom.
You've got to give the guy a break.

33:55.297 --> 33:57.743
He's not gonna watch TV
in the bedroom forever.

33:57.776 --> 34:00.032
No. No, he's not.

34:00.068 --> 34:02.563
Oh, my God,
I don't mean he's gonna die.

34:02.595 --> 34:04.373
What are you telling me?
That he's going to live forever?

34:04.406 --> 34:05.943
That he's immortal?
Is that what you're telling me?

34:05.977 --> 34:09.070
No, I'm just saying,
with time, you know...

34:09.108 --> 34:10.572
It's like a canoe.

34:11.357 --> 34:13.580
- What's like a canoe?
- Life.

34:13.617 --> 34:14.612
Okay.

34:14.646 --> 34:17.322
You're just paddling
along in a canoe.

34:17.355 --> 34:19.243
Mother, have you ever
been in a canoe?

34:19.677 --> 34:21.983
I just can't picture
you in a canoe.

34:22.016 --> 34:25.080
Your father and I have been paddling
a canoe together for years.

34:25.114 --> 34:27.422
Only now,
he's dropped the paddle.

34:27.697 --> 34:28.960
He just dropped it.

34:28.996 --> 34:32.293
Not only that,
but now the canoe is going in circles.

34:32.895 --> 34:35.742
Without your father there,
I'm paddling on my side

34:35.775 --> 34:37.831
and the canoe is
spinning in circles,

34:37.868 --> 34:40.143
and the harder I paddle,
the faster it spins,

34:40.178 --> 34:42.542
and it's hard work,
and I'm getting tired.

34:42.578 --> 34:43.911
Dizzy, I would think.

34:45.368 --> 34:47.813
You are in a kayak.

34:47.844 --> 34:49.632
You know how to do all of this.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.793
How does that put
me in a kayak?

34:51.824 --> 34:54.951
Kayaks have paddles with
things on both ends.

34:54.987 --> 34:56.492
You steer it by yourself.

34:56.527 --> 34:58.942
Mom, you know how to
do things by yourself.

34:58.977 --> 35:00.722
You are totally capable.

35:00.757 --> 35:03.242
Sure, I went to Smith,
and I was a history major,

35:03.278 --> 35:05.903
but I never had any
plans to be an historian.

35:05.935 --> 35:07.961
I was always going
to be a wife.

35:07.996 --> 35:11.280
I mean, the way I saw it,
a woman's job was to run a home,

35:11.316 --> 35:13.581
organize the social
life of a family,

35:13.616 --> 35:16.191
and bolster her husband
while he earned a living.

35:16.226 --> 35:19.841
It was a good system, and it was
working very well all these years.

35:19.877 --> 35:22.621
Only when your husband isn't there
because he's watching television

35:22.656 --> 35:26.020
in a dressing gown,
you realize how dependent you are.

35:26.057 --> 35:28.160
I didn't even know
I owned windmills.

35:28.197 --> 35:31.271
Mom, now you know,
and you know how to right-click.

35:31.306 --> 35:32.400
But you.

35:32.588 --> 35:35.020
You provide for yourself.

35:35.228 --> 35:37.090
You're not dependent on anyone.

35:37.466 --> 35:39.112
You're independent.

35:39.145 --> 35:41.203
I am kayak, hear me roar.

35:41.238 --> 35:42.712
I mean, look at you.

35:42.746 --> 35:46.923
For all these years,
you've done very well without a husband.

35:46.956 --> 35:48.460
Maybe so,

35:48.645 --> 35:50.933
but I still wanted
it to work out.

35:50.965 --> 35:55.323
You know, the way I was raised, if a
married couple split up, it was a disaster,

35:55.355 --> 35:57.820
because it meant the
system had fallen apart,

35:57.856 --> 36:00.692
and it was particularly bad for
the woman because she had to go out

36:00.725 --> 36:02.443
and find herself
another rich husband,

36:02.477 --> 36:04.183
only she was older now.

36:04.218 --> 36:07.332
But with you,
it's not such a disaster, is it?

36:07.368 --> 36:08.710
I guess not.

36:08.748 --> 36:11.900
It's really not such a horrible thing
that you're going to get a divorce,

36:11.936 --> 36:13.301
not really.

36:13.465 --> 36:15.882
Oh, you're gonna be fine.

36:17.758 --> 36:19.162
Thanks, mom.

36:19.198 --> 36:22.250
You may even marry someone else someday.
Who knows?

36:24.288 --> 36:25.542
Who knows?

36:29.827 --> 36:32.142
Do you know what I think
impressed my dad the most?

36:32.175 --> 36:35.590
You eating a 24-ounce steak. Seriously,
it was, like, a magic trick to him.

36:35.625 --> 36:36.850
It was a pretty
fun dinner, though.

36:36.887 --> 36:38.000
Yeah, it was.

36:38.035 --> 36:41.092
Whoa! Look at all this!

36:41.318 --> 36:44.440
Ace! Oh, my god,
you got me a piñata!

36:44.478 --> 36:46.301
Well, you deserve a piñata.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.461
I couldn't reach the ceiling,
so I just...

36:49.445 --> 36:51.843
- Hey, um, Logan...
- Yeah?

36:54.305 --> 36:57.593
Your dad and I had a bit of
a weird conversation tonight.

36:57.626 --> 36:58.643
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

36:58.675 --> 37:03.102
He started thanking me for guiding you
and steering you, or -- I don't know.

37:03.138 --> 37:06.633
And then he said that he and I
should start planning your future,

37:06.665 --> 37:07.910
like, together.

37:07.945 --> 37:10.771
- Well, that's my dad for you.
- Well, it felt really weird.

37:11.305 --> 37:13.683
I felt like we were
conspiring or something.

37:13.717 --> 37:15.953
I didn't even agree with
what he was saying.

37:15.988 --> 37:17.830
I ended up toasting.
I toasted him.

37:17.867 --> 37:18.802
What did you toast?

37:18.838 --> 37:21.080
"To being on the same
page," which I'm not.

37:21.115 --> 37:23.130
I'm not even on the
same page with him.

37:23.168 --> 37:25.963
I actually think that
everything you've accomplished

37:25.998 --> 37:28.850
is just because you've worked hard,
and I'm proud of you.

37:28.885 --> 37:32.043
I don't even know how the
conversation ended up where it did.

37:32.075 --> 37:35.003
It's okay. You know what just happened?
You got Hunzbergered.

37:35.037 --> 37:37.581
That's what my dad does to people.
He's a master in manipulating.

37:37.615 --> 37:39.283
You sit down,
and you have your own opinions.

37:39.317 --> 37:41.732
By the time you stand up,
you hear yourself agreeing with him,

37:41.765 --> 37:43.681
and you stagger away
confused and queasy.

37:43.717 --> 37:46.421
Yes! That's exactly it!
I got Hunzbergered!

37:46.456 --> 37:48.070
It happens to the best of us.

37:48.105 --> 37:49.873
Well, I'm glad
you're not upset.

37:49.908 --> 37:51.380
No, not at all.

37:51.416 --> 37:54.133
I mean, I don't like the fact that the
guy thinks of me as some kind of puppet,

37:54.165 --> 37:56.973
but pretty soon,
he's gonna have to rethink that one.

37:57.467 --> 37:59.563
You got me twister.
I never had twister.

37:59.597 --> 38:00.821
- You didn't?
- No.

38:00.857 --> 38:04.421
It was a childhood of deprivation.
Oh, and "Pin the tail on the --"

38:04.457 --> 38:06.743
- What animal is that?
- Oh, that was a donkey.

38:06.778 --> 38:08.770
But I messed the ears up,
put antlers on it.

38:08.807 --> 38:10.423
Now it's "pin the
tail on the moose."

38:10.466 --> 38:12.803
I never had "pin the tail on
the moose" as a boy, either.

38:12.838 --> 38:14.140
Poor little rich boy.

38:14.175 --> 38:15.893
I think that since
we're short on time,

38:15.925 --> 38:18.583
we should skip to the
classic 12th birthday --

38:18.618 --> 38:20.080
ice-skating in central park.

38:20.117 --> 38:21.990
- Sounds good.
- Great. I'll go change.

38:24.767 --> 38:26.503
Hey, Philip, what's up, man?

38:26.536 --> 38:28.620
I'm afraid I've
got some grim news.

38:29.166 --> 38:30.540
What? What's going on?

38:30.575 --> 38:32.700
I just got off the line with our
lawyers. They say they just got

38:32.737 --> 38:34.801
a cease-and-desist letter
from Prism Active,

38:34.837 --> 38:38.923
this tech company in Palo Alto, claming
prior art on our media 10 platform.

38:38.957 --> 38:41.411
- They're reviewing the patent now, but --
- What do you mean, "prior art"?

38:41.445 --> 38:43.301
They're claiming
patent infringement.

38:43.338 --> 38:44.921
That's what we bought.
Our patent's pending.

38:44.957 --> 38:46.960
We bought that technology.
That's the entire value of the company.

38:46.995 --> 38:49.241
They're saying it's worthless.
It was already owned.

38:49.275 --> 38:52.313
They were just waiting for someone
to buy in before they sued.

38:52.345 --> 38:53.530
Oh, my god.

38:53.567 --> 38:54.921
I'm so sorry.

38:55.608 --> 38:57.193
Happy birthday, man.

39:03.777 --> 39:06.291
Okay. Close your eyes.

39:09.756 --> 39:11.253
Are they closed?

39:13.615 --> 39:14.841
They're closed.

39:15.648 --> 39:18.751
Okay. Voilà.

39:20.068 --> 39:23.363
Wow. It's a giant, furry --
what the hell?

39:23.398 --> 39:27.331
It's a russian ushanka,
which also doubles as a birthday crown.

39:27.638 --> 39:29.072
Wow. I bet I look great.

39:29.106 --> 39:30.560
Mmm, you have no idea.

39:38.346 --> 39:39.902
- Hey, Luke.
- Hey, T.J.

39:39.938 --> 39:42.590
You know what you could use?
A changing table.

39:42.627 --> 39:45.712
Yeah, and if you're getting stuff for
your apartment, you should get a dryer.

39:45.747 --> 39:49.261
Yeah, I'm not getting things.
Why do I need a dryer?

39:49.297 --> 39:50.620
Sopping towels.

39:50.655 --> 39:52.350
And why are the towels sopping?

39:52.388 --> 39:55.762
My bad. I forgot you said not
to use the garbage disposal.

39:55.795 --> 39:58.551
Well, not forgot, so much as,
I thought you were exaggerating.

39:58.587 --> 39:59.980
I wasn't exaggerating.

40:00.018 --> 40:01.772
And we have more bad news.

40:01.806 --> 40:02.692
Oh, yeah?

40:02.728 --> 40:05.861
The exterminator said the moths
turned out to be rice moths.

40:05.895 --> 40:08.321
And this means you'll be
staying how much longer?

40:08.357 --> 40:10.131
Which means we're
headed home right now.

40:10.167 --> 40:11.882
Most of the stuff's
already in the car.

40:11.917 --> 40:14.973
Rice moths are a snap to get rid of.
They're already gone.

40:15.007 --> 40:17.951
It's just a bummer to leave, 'cause
we've been having such a good time.

40:17.986 --> 40:21.872
Yeah, but Doula should
be in her own home.

40:21.906 --> 40:23.970
That's what we thought,
plus your mattress.

40:24.005 --> 40:25.441
Not so comfortable,
shall we say.

40:25.476 --> 40:27.070
Yeah, well, sorry about that.

40:27.188 --> 40:29.513
No worries, no worries, but...

40:29.546 --> 40:32.473
put it on the list of things
you're gonna fix around here.

40:32.505 --> 40:33.551
- All right, then.
- All right.

40:33.586 --> 40:34.981
- Thanks again.
- Okay.

40:35.016 --> 40:38.163
Your casa is my casa.
For that, I'm grateful.

40:38.197 --> 40:41.163
You take care and call if
you're feeling lonely.

40:41.196 --> 40:42.580
We will come and visit.

40:42.616 --> 40:44.362
- Okay, anytime.
- Sounds great.

40:44.395 --> 40:46.132
Anytime, I mean it.

40:47.405 --> 40:49.081
- Bye.
- Bye.

41:06.527 --> 41:07.740
Good morning.

41:07.776 --> 41:09.321
Good morning.
Would you like some coffee?

41:09.356 --> 41:10.390
Yes.

41:10.428 --> 41:12.551
Oh, I woke up this morning,
and I've got to say,

41:12.585 --> 41:15.913
for the first time in my life, I got
where the teetotalers are coming from.

41:15.945 --> 41:18.253
If I had a hatchet
and a barrel of booze,

41:18.285 --> 41:19.590
forget about it.

41:20.918 --> 41:22.030
What are you up to today?

41:22.066 --> 41:26.340
Today? I'm going to attend a D.A.R.
lecture on the native american artwork.

41:26.378 --> 41:29.570
Then I have a lunch with Sarah
Montgomery Brown and Melissa Seria,

41:29.606 --> 41:32.462
and, of course, I'll have my
hands full canceling the party.

41:32.496 --> 41:34.340
I've already called the
florist and the hall.

41:34.376 --> 41:36.471
We'll only get 60%
of our deposit back,

41:36.506 --> 41:38.720
but that's better than nothing.

41:40.708 --> 41:42.252
I should go.

41:42.648 --> 41:45.080
I need time to change before
I have to go to the Inn.

41:45.115 --> 41:46.331
Fine.

41:47.365 --> 41:49.811
Thank you for your help with
the quicken last night.

41:51.255 --> 41:52.572
You're welcome.
