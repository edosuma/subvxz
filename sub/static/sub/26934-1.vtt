- [Charlie mutters]
- [crying]

11:13.498 --> 11:14.717
- What'd you just do?
- I didn't do anything.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.154
Hey, what's going on?

11:17.198 --> 11:18.808
What's wrong?

11:18.852 --> 11:22.072
I don't know,
I just got really...

11:22.116 --> 11:24.161
Oh, my God, I'm embarrassed.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.817
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

11:27.861 --> 11:30.167
- What's up?
- Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.

11:30.211 --> 11:31.691

- I just feel like--

11:31.734 --> 11:35.216
Oh, my God.

11:35.259 --> 11:38.523
I just feel like I haven't
been touched in so long.

11:38.567 --> 11:41.526
Just so fucking lonely.
I really...

11:43.137 --> 11:44.399
Yeah, it's hard.

11:44.878 --> 11:48.055
Oh! I'm just fucking pissed
or something!

11:49.012 --> 11:51.449
[softly] It's okay. It's okay.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.930
I know...
I know what you're feeling.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.802
It's okay.

11:55.845 --> 11:58.413
Is this-- Oh, my God...
[growls]

11:58.456 --> 12:00.894
- Do you wanna stop?
- No.

12:00.937 --> 12:03.810
I do not wanna stop.
Let's take our pants off.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.594
Let's take our pants off,
okay?

12:05.637 --> 12:07.248
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's keep going.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.641
Are you sure?
All right.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.469
Sorry, I'm just, like,
can't believe I just did that.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.602
Maybe we should like,
we should take a second.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.604
Oh, yeah, okay.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.911
- Sorry, did I just...
- No, no, no, no.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.782
It's okay.
It's really okay.

12:19.826 --> 12:22.132
Look, we're all...
We're all here together.

12:22.176 --> 12:23.786
- Okay.
- Okay?

12:23.830 --> 12:25.962
I just, I don't know what's
going on with me right now.

12:26.006 --> 12:30.227
I'm just so overwhelmed. I feel like I
haven't been touched in a really long time.

You know? Like, I just feel
like, um...

12:32.403 --> 12:35.189
I'm a little out of sorts
or something.

12:35.232 --> 12:36.756
- Okay.
- Uh...

12:36.799 --> 12:40.281
Anyway, um...

12:40.324 --> 12:42.152
Maybe we should take
a timeout?

12:42.196 --> 12:44.154
No, no, no.
Let's take our pants off.

12:44.198 --> 12:45.677
Let's take
our pants off.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.201
I think this is a good id--

12:47.505 --> 12:49.856
This is a good time
to take the pants off.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.120
Off.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.562
[whimpering] Will you guys
come into bed with me?

13:00.605 --> 13:02.303

- I'm so sorry.
- Are you still crying?

13:18.493 --> 13:21.713
No. I'm not.
I just need to be hugged.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.715
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.021
- Okay, just--
- It's fine, okay.

13:25.065 --> 13:27.067
I'm just totally fucking around.

Charlie...

13:32.768 --> 13:34.248
- Hmm?
- Get in here, man.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.467
Okay. Um...

13:48.697 --> 13:50.090
Oh, sorry.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.877
[Zoe] Will you hang on for a second?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:55.051 --> 13:57.575
- I just feel like-- - I
honestly think this might not--

13:57.619 --> 13:59.229
Oh, God. Are you okay?

13:59.273 --> 14:01.449
- Sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

14:01.492 --> 14:04.452
- Are you okay?
- Guys, I really think we should stop.

14:04.495 --> 14:07.150
[laughs]
Oh, my gosh.

14:07.194 --> 14:10.023
- I am so sorry I hit your head.
- It's okay. It's okay.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.939
This is, like, a real overwhelming,
emotional thing for me.

14:12.982 --> 14:14.679
- It didn't hurt.
- I'm sorry.

14:14.723 --> 14:17.465
I just-- I honestly think
that is not going that--

14:17.508 --> 14:18.945
No, no, no, it's fine.

14:18.988 --> 14:22.296
This is completely
just connected, that's all.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.224
Thanks for letting me
wear them.

No worries.

Um...

16:07.357 --> 16:09.533
so, yeah, man.
I...

16:09.577 --> 16:10.882
The threesome didn't go down

16:10.926 --> 16:12.754

gonna happen.

We're good.
How is she?

16:22.633 --> 16:24.374
- She's good, man.
- She seemed like, uh...

16:24.418 --> 16:26.028
What was going on with her?

16:26.072 --> 16:29.118
She just got out of a really
intense relationship,

16:29.162 --> 16:32.687
uh, and so she's very
stirred up.

16:32.730 --> 16:36.169
But, uh, I think last night
was really good for her.

16:36.212 --> 16:38.693
- Good.
- Yeah.

16:38.736 --> 16:41.000
So, um...

16:41.043 --> 16:43.176

I-I just feel like I was
happy to be there for her

16:46.831 --> 16:51.010

and I felt like...

16:51.053 --> 16:53.621
you know...

16:53.664 --> 16:56.885
what happened was...
what happened.

16:58.713 --> 17:01.063
As far as I go,
I left.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.152
I came in here.
I, like...

17:03.196 --> 17:04.632
had a little "me" time,
did a little reading.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.634
I just went,
you know what?

17:06.676 --> 17:07.983
I think I'm gonna
simplify this

17:08.027 --> 17:10.159
and-and leave the room.

17:10.203 --> 17:13.205
I-I really appreciate that.

17:13.249 --> 17:16.773
Um, I'm gonna spend a couple
days at her house.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.819
We're gonna kind of get to know
each other a little better.

- Yeah. Yeah.

You know, really.
I'm really happy to, like...

17:30.049 --> 17:31.833
make that connection.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.400
You were the connection-maker.

17:33.443 --> 17:35.532
It feels like she was just
speaking

17:35.576 --> 17:37.839
the same language as me.

17:37.882 --> 17:41.016
Like, she, uh...

17:41.060 --> 17:45.238
she could understand...

17:45.281 --> 17:47.196
like...

17:47.240 --> 17:49.677
the-the craziest nuances

17:49.720 --> 17:51.766
of everything I was trying
to say to her.

And-and I could--
I felt the same way

17:54.247 --> 17:55.596
about what she was
saying to me.

It makes me wanna cry.
It makes me wanna laugh.

It makes me wanna
sing and dance.

I'd sing right now. I just don't
wanna wake her up.

he pulled an extra ticket,

to invite a friend?"

My friend Lucy's in town."

24:01.222 --> 24:03.572

of inspiration,

24:03.616 --> 24:06.967

cucumber,

I wish I retained
some of it.

01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:38.255
It just feels like I spent--

01:06:38.298 --> 01:06:40.474
We spent, like,
$200,000 on school,

01:06:40.518 --> 01:06:42.607
and I don't know fucking
anything about bonobos

01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:44.217
or monkeys or anything.

01:06:44.261 --> 01:06:46.306
- [chuckles] Bonobos.
- What?

01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:48.787
She was a bonobo specialist.
I don't know shit about them.

01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:51.790
She's, like, the queen of
the bonobos

01:06:51.833 --> 01:06:53.313
among the humans
in the world.

01:06:53.357 --> 01:06:54.706
She was great, man.

01:06:54.749 --> 01:06:56.142
And the books that
she assigned us to read

01:06:56.186 --> 01:06:57.883
were all books that, like,

01:06:57.926 --> 01:07:00.929
actually made me feel
really good.

01:07:00.973 --> 01:07:02.714
You know, they weren't just
stupid textbooks,

01:07:02.757 --> 01:07:04.846
they were the kind of books
you'd read

01:07:04.890 --> 01:07:06.979
if you were, like,
on mushrooms.

01:07:09.895 --> 01:07:11.505
Did we get that
chocolate cake?

01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:13.594
Mm-hmm. You want me to
get it right now?

01:07:13.638 --> 01:07:15.988
- Yeah, will you get it?
- You want some?

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:18.469
- Yeah, chocolate.
- It's $30, dude.

01:07:18.512 --> 01:07:21.080
- You're telling me--
- No, you don't have to pay.

01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:22.951
I'll be right back.

Why, you want a glass of milk?

Yes, Mommy.
