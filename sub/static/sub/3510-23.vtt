00:00.340 --> 00:01.825
Previously on "Castle"...

00:01.826 --> 00:03.128
Who killed my mother?

00:03.129 --> 00:04.331
No, Kate. I give you a name, I know you.

00:04.332 --> 00:05.353
You'll run straight at him.

00:05.354 --> 00:06.891
I might as well shoot you where you stand.

00:06.892 --> 00:08.693
They are coming to kill you,
and I'm not gonna let 'em.

00:08.693 --> 00:10.053
I'm gonna end this.

00:11.232 --> 00:14.374
No one outside of this immediate family

00:14.375 --> 00:16.878
ever needs to know about this.

00:16.879 --> 00:18.411
As far as the world is concerned,

00:18.412 --> 00:20.459
Roy Montgomery died a hero.

00:21.591 --> 00:22.453
Kate!

00:25.131 --> 00:26.588
It was supposed to be over.

00:26.589 --> 00:29.690
Montgomery sacrificed
himself to keep her safe.

00:29.691 --> 00:33.091
This is so much bigger than you realize.

00:34.781 --> 00:36.415
Hello.
Mr. Castle,

00:36.416 --> 00:38.263
I'm a friend of Roy Montgomery's.

00:38.264 --> 00:39.584
We need to talk.

00:39.585 --> 00:42.166
He says she's safe now on one condition.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.957
She can't go near her mother's case.

00:43.958 --> 00:46.382
She'll listen to me. I can steer her away.

00:58.782 --> 01:00.614
No! Ah!

01:00.615 --> 01:01.695
Beckett!

01:01.696 --> 01:02.638
Castle!

01:02.639 --> 01:03.623
Beckett!

01:03.624 --> 01:05.123
Castle, I'm here!

01:05.123 --> 01:06.404
Beckett, hang on!

01:08.600 --> 01:12.000
3 days ealier

01:15.947 --> 01:20.354
Either this is the most
boring dream I've ever had

01:20.355 --> 01:21.815
or you can't sleep either.

01:21.816 --> 01:24.486
It's not a dream. More like a nightmare.

01:24.487 --> 01:26.341
Is this about your valedictorian speech?

01:26.342 --> 01:28.152
It's my chance to say something important,

01:28.153 --> 01:29.434
something worthy.

01:29.715 --> 01:32.155
I don't want to blow it, but I
feel like I have nothing to say.

01:32.512 --> 01:33.315
You mean nothing compared to

01:33.316 --> 01:34.994
the great sacred texts of mankind

01:34.995 --> 01:37.367
or Winston Churchill's speech to harrows,

01:37.368 --> 01:39.160
or Steve Jobs' address to Stanford?

01:39.161 --> 01:40.717
You know, maybe you
should pick some speeches

01:40.718 --> 01:43.207
st a little less daunting
to compare yours to,

01:43.208 --> 01:46.261
like, um, "Say Anything" or "Twilight."

01:46.262 --> 01:47.941
It's not supposed to be this hard.

01:47.942 --> 01:50.857
You know, the most
worthwhile things in life

01:50.858 --> 01:52.940
are often the most difficult.

01:52.941 --> 01:54.009
For example...

01:56.642 --> 01:58.593
Wow. That really is a smart phone.

01:59.754 --> 02:00.562
Of course you don't understand

02:00.563 --> 02:02.942
why she's taking her graduation
speech so seriously.

02:02.943 --> 02:05.094
You were probably the guy who
had nothing on but boxers

02:05.095 --> 02:06.359
underneath his gown.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.754
That is so insulting.

02:07.755 --> 02:09.513
If you must know, I was naked underneath.

02:09.514 --> 02:12.577
Oh, I'm sorry. I stand corrected.

02:12.578 --> 02:14.858
So how is the father of
the graduate taking it?

02:14.859 --> 02:16.507
I already have a plan to drown my sorrows.

02:16.508 --> 02:19.115
After the ceremony, my mother
goes off to the Hamptons,

02:19.116 --> 02:20.807
Alexis will be doing her all-nighter.

02:20.808 --> 02:23.012
I will be distracting myself
with a double feature

02:23.013 --> 02:24.981
of "The Killer" and "Hard Boiled."

02:24.982 --> 02:27.012
Wow. That is a double feature.

02:27.013 --> 02:28.196
You like John Woo?

02:28.524 --> 02:29.680
The bloodier the better.

02:31.433 --> 02:34.051
You wouldn't want to... join me, would you?

02:35.319 --> 02:36.567
Actually, I'd love to.

02:42.045 --> 02:43.137
You coming, Castle?

02:43.138 --> 02:44.415
Yeah. Please.

02:45.420 --> 02:46.214
Hey.

02:46.215 --> 02:47.089
So?

02:47.090 --> 02:48.819
So we've got a Hispanic male, late 20s.

02:48.820 --> 02:50.373
Cabbie spotted the body about an hour ago

02:50.374 --> 02:51.458
and called it in.

02:51.751 --> 02:52.726
We got an I.D.?

02:52.727 --> 02:53.665
Nah. We checked his pockets.

02:53.666 --> 02:55.308
There's no phone, keys, or wallet.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.202
And we're checking prints right now.

02:56.203 --> 02:57.828
From the blood trail, it
looks like he was shot

02:57.829 --> 02:59.183
before he entered the alley.

02:59.184 --> 03:00.059
He was hit in the shoulder

03:00.060 --> 03:02.336
with what looks like a.357,

03:02.337 --> 03:05.818
but the kill shot...
point-blank, execution style,

03:05.819 --> 03:07.390
with a 9 millimeter.

03:07.391 --> 03:08.977
Two guns. Could be more than one shooter.

03:08.978 --> 03:11.205
Was C.S.U. able to trace that blood trail

03:11.206 --> 03:12.483
from the first shot?

03:12.484 --> 03:13.850
It starts around the corner.

03:13.851 --> 03:15.313
There's no visible point of origin,

03:15.314 --> 03:16.813
but the teams are still looking.

03:16.814 --> 03:18.489
Well, this is a bad neighborhood.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.338
Maybe it was a mugging gone wrong?

03:20.339 --> 03:21.120
Maybe.

03:21.121 --> 03:23.008
These grooves in his shoulder indicate

03:23.009 --> 03:25.260
that he was carrying
something, and it was heavy.

03:25.261 --> 03:27.114
I'd say at least 30 pounds.

03:27.115 --> 03:30.375
I'm even seeing traces of skin
tissue in his fingernail.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.721
I may be able to get D.N.A.,

03:31.722 --> 03:34.092
but I'll know a lot more once
I get him back to the morgue.

03:34.093 --> 03:35.934
Uh, his pockets may have been empty,

03:35.935 --> 03:38.153
but it looks like he was trying
to hide something in his shoe.

03:42.722 --> 03:43.751
Lock picks?

03:43.752 --> 03:46.953
Now why would someone
be needing lock picks?

03:46.954 --> 03:48.496
He's a thief.

03:48.497 --> 03:49.968
Orlando Costas.

03:49.969 --> 03:53.230
A couple of domestic B&Es, but
suspected of a dozen more.

03:53.231 --> 03:54.855
He used to run with the Cazadores.

03:54.856 --> 03:55.681
Cazadores?

03:55.682 --> 03:57.288
They're a violent street
gang that deals in drugs,

03:57.289 --> 03:58.534
arms, and larceny,

03:58.535 --> 04:01.090
but all of Orlando's priors are
back when he was a teenager.

04:01.091 --> 04:02.337
He hasn't been arrested in years.

04:02.338 --> 04:03.358
Maybe he got back in the game.

04:03.359 --> 04:05.363
I don't know. He went a long
way to clean up his act.

04:05.364 --> 04:07.116
Did four years active in the military,

04:07.117 --> 04:08.921
discharged with honors last year.

04:08.922 --> 04:11.371
Spent his rotation as an M.P. in Germany.

04:11.372 --> 04:14.074
Military police? He really
did clean up his act.

04:14.075 --> 04:15.201
If this guy went straight,

04:15.202 --> 04:17.197
then how did he end up dead in an alley?

04:17.197 --> 04:18.779
Did you check for next of kin?

04:18.781 --> 04:19.887
Uh, his folks are dead,

04:19.887 --> 04:22.684
but we managed to track down a
girlfriend... Marisol Castaneda.

04:22.685 --> 04:24.378
Esposito's bringing her in right now.

04:24.759 --> 04:27.213
All I know is, he was
with me in bed last night

04:27.214 --> 04:29.167
when I went to sleep.

04:29.168 --> 04:30.288
I woke up this morning,

04:30.289 --> 04:32.263
and both him and my car were gone.

04:32.664 --> 04:34.129
Where did he go?

04:34.130 --> 04:36.058
I figured he'd gone to the career center

04:36.059 --> 04:37.854
to check the job listings.

04:38.203 --> 04:39.743
He does that every morning.

04:40.063 --> 04:41.291
He'd been looking for work?

04:41.292 --> 04:42.238
For months.

04:42.239 --> 04:44.451
Orlando served his country.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.593
You'd think that means something,

04:45.594 --> 04:47.152
but it's been tough,

04:47.153 --> 04:48.910
especially after my hours got cut.

04:48.911 --> 04:50.587
So he was under financial pressure?

04:50.588 --> 04:53.299
Is it possible that he
went back to old habits?

04:54.044 --> 04:55.020
No.

04:56.034 --> 04:58.487
Look, Marisol, we know that
he ran with the Cazadores.

04:58.488 --> 05:00.054
Do you think that...
I said no.

05:00.458 --> 05:02.222
He went through hell to escape that life.

05:02.223 --> 05:05.561
It's why he enlisted, to get out,

05:05.901 --> 05:07.590
to be a better man for me...

05:08.109 --> 05:09.900
A better father to our son.

05:11.288 --> 05:13.394
So how about you stop trying
to make this his fault

05:13.395 --> 05:15.058
and find whoever killed him?

05:19.236 --> 05:20.580
What kind of car do you have?

05:21.684 --> 05:23.414
Two blocks away from the alley,

05:23.828 --> 05:25.994
blood smeared on the arm rest...
This is definitely it.

05:25.995 --> 05:28.177
He was shot somewhere else
and then he came here?

05:28.178 --> 05:30.022
Why not go home? Why not go get patched up?

05:30.023 --> 05:31.869
He was meeting someone in that alleyway.

05:31.870 --> 05:32.856
Phone.

05:32.857 --> 05:35.118
His last call was 4:47 A.M.,
just before he died.

05:35.119 --> 05:36.558
Run that number.
Right.

05:36.559 --> 05:38.233
Hey, Beckett, gun.

05:39.324 --> 05:40.586
It's a.38.

05:41.297 --> 05:42.379
Recently fired.

05:42.380 --> 05:43.140
So it was a shootout.

05:43.141 --> 05:44.817
That's how he got the shoulder wound.
Which means,

05:44.818 --> 05:46.881
wherever he came from, there
might be another body.

05:46.882 --> 05:48.212
I know where he was coming from.

05:48.213 --> 05:48.827
Where?

05:48.828 --> 05:50.930
His last entry was 299 First Avenue.

05:50.931 --> 05:52.805
Wait. What's at 299 First Ave.?

05:52.806 --> 05:54.587
Captain Montgomery's house.

06:01.116 --> 06:02.947
We're just thankful no one was hurt.

06:02.948 --> 06:04.556
Believe me, so am I.

06:05.006 --> 06:05.934
Ever since Roy died,

06:05.935 --> 06:08.634
I've slept with his.357 in the nightstand.

06:08.635 --> 06:09.859
So it was just the one guy?

06:09.860 --> 06:11.203
As far as I know.

06:11.777 --> 06:13.625
He was taking files out of the cabinet.

06:13.626 --> 06:16.897
He had Roy's old laptop in his backpack.

06:17.315 --> 06:20.143
When he saw me, he pulled his weapon,

06:20.580 --> 06:22.175
so God help me, I shot him.

06:22.176 --> 06:23.672
I think I hit him in his shoulder.

06:23.673 --> 06:27.115
He fired back, and then he
crashed through the window.

06:27.116 --> 06:28.779
Evelyn, was this the guy?

06:29.615 --> 06:31.588
Yeah. That's him.

06:32.203 --> 06:33.846
I'm glad Evan and the girls weren't home.

06:33.847 --> 06:35.186
Funny thing is,

06:35.187 --> 06:36.772
I wasn't supposed to be home either.

06:36.773 --> 06:39.662
It's almost like he knew we
weren't supposed to be here.

06:40.071 --> 06:42.551
Anything special about those files?

06:42.552 --> 06:44.958
Just paperwork, legal documents,

06:44.959 --> 06:46.539
notes on Roy's old cases.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.705
What about his computer?
What... what was on that?

06:48.706 --> 06:50.377
His old work files, but mostly,

06:50.378 --> 06:52.987
I use it for Christmas cards and recipes.

06:55.979 --> 06:58.067
They went after Montgomery's files.

06:58.068 --> 07:00.351
Not valuables, not cash.

07:00.352 --> 07:01.353
And now our thief is dead

07:01.354 --> 07:03.247
and the files he took are missing?

07:03.248 --> 07:05.276
Well, let's not jump to conclusions.

07:05.277 --> 07:06.894
What else would it be about?

07:06.895 --> 07:08.183
Everyone here thinks Montgomery died

07:08.184 --> 07:09.871
bringing a cop killer to justice.

07:09.872 --> 07:12.495
We're the only ones who know
what he was really involved in

07:12.496 --> 07:15.029
and his connection to your mother's murder.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.697
Beckett, it can't be a coincidence.

07:17.698 --> 07:18.809
Recheck the vic's rap sheet.

07:18.810 --> 07:20.994
See if Montgomery was involved
in any of his old arrests,

07:20.995 --> 07:21.724
and get on that number.

07:21.725 --> 07:24.299
I want to know who he was
talking to just before he died.

07:37.534 --> 07:39.076
Say something reassuring.

07:39.077 --> 07:42.817
There are thousands of break-ins
in New York City every year.

07:46.126 --> 07:47.770
This one feels different.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.558
Well, that doesn't mean that it is.

07:49.559 --> 07:51.411
Montgomery worked hundreds of cases.

07:51.412 --> 07:52.782
Just because this guy was after files

07:52.783 --> 07:54.466
doesn't mean he was after your mom's case.

07:54.467 --> 07:56.421
Then why is our thief dead?

07:58.004 --> 08:00.141
You know those people that
Montgomery was involved with,

08:00.142 --> 08:02.209
he said that they wanted me dead,

08:02.210 --> 08:03.901
that I was getting too close,

08:03.902 --> 08:05.749
and he said that he was gonna give his life

08:05.750 --> 08:07.039
in order to protect mine,

08:07.040 --> 08:08.595
and they still tried to kill me.

08:09.578 --> 08:11.867
I wake up sometimes, and I think to myself,

08:12.313 --> 08:14.350
how the hell am I still alive?

08:15.412 --> 08:18.503
It's like I'm just waiting
for that other shoe to drop.

08:19.304 --> 08:21.169
What if this is that other shoe?

08:22.200 --> 08:30.050
Sync by YYeTs

08:33.700 --> 08:39.700
Castle s04e23
Always

08:43.785 --> 08:46.794
Things were finally getting better for her,

08:46.795 --> 08:48.004
for us.

08:49.341 --> 08:50.687
She was just coming out of her shell,

08:50.688 --> 08:51.895
and now this?

08:52.491 --> 08:53.852
Do you really think it's related

08:53.853 --> 08:55.319
to her mother's murder case?

08:55.320 --> 08:56.996
I hope to God it isn't.

08:57.590 --> 08:59.338
Montgomery's friend was very clear.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.975
She starts poking around
her mother's murder,

09:00.976 --> 09:02.570
they'll come after her again.

09:04.449 --> 09:05.873
I can't let that happen.

09:07.033 --> 09:08.070
I know.

09:27.090 --> 09:27.854
Thank you.

09:27.855 --> 09:29.021
Did you get any sleep?

09:31.087 --> 09:32.187
Not much.

09:33.366 --> 09:34.681
Anything new on our victim?

09:35.172 --> 09:36.717
We rechecked Orlando's rap sheet.

09:36.718 --> 09:39.604
Montgomery wasn't involved
in any of his old arrests.

09:39.605 --> 09:41.159
That break-in wasn't personal.

09:41.160 --> 09:43.040
What about the call he
made before he was killed?

09:43.041 --> 09:46.094
It's from a burner phone.
There's no registered owner.

09:47.064 --> 09:48.570
Hey.
Hmm?

09:49.368 --> 09:51.052
You're not in this alone.

09:51.053 --> 09:52.077
I'm here.

09:54.791 --> 09:55.919
I know.

10:01.763 --> 10:02.814
Hey.

10:03.593 --> 10:04.855
We may have been wrong

10:04.856 --> 10:06.210
about why they hit Montgomery's.

10:06.211 --> 10:08.766
Witnesses saw a Hispanic
male fleeing the alley

10:08.767 --> 10:10.750
in a late-model Maroon DeVille.

10:10.751 --> 10:13.442
Apparently he had gang ink on his neck...

10:13.443 --> 10:15.611
a lion framed by a "C."

10:15.699 --> 10:16.755
Cazador?

10:16.756 --> 10:19.065
The very same gang that
our victim ran with.

10:19.149 --> 10:20.263
Gangs.

10:21.028 --> 10:22.393
If this guy was in that alley,

10:22.394 --> 10:24.343
odds are, he killed Orlando.

10:25.288 --> 10:26.724
Did we get a license plate?

10:26.725 --> 10:28.836
Uh, no, but according to gang task force,

10:28.837 --> 10:31.910
the ride matches the car
of one Vicente Delgado.

10:31.911 --> 10:34.186
High-level shot caller for the Cazadores.

10:34.187 --> 10:35.196
And get this.

10:35.197 --> 10:38.386
His cousin Diego Gutierrez
was busted by Montgomery

10:38.387 --> 10:40.494
for a double homicide in '95.

10:40.495 --> 10:42.755
His lawyer's filed a motion for retrial

10:42.756 --> 10:45.063
a month after Montgomery was killed.

10:47.220 --> 10:48.344
Find him.

10:50.352 --> 10:52.149
NYPD! Let me see your hands right now!

10:52.150 --> 10:53.627
Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!

10:53.628 --> 10:54.727
Let me see your hands!

10:57.814 --> 10:58.871
Well, looky here,

10:58.872 --> 11:00.189
a 9 millimeter.

11:00.822 --> 11:03.152
Just like the gun that
killed Orlando Costas.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.365
I already told you, I was
nowhere near that alley.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.139
Fact is, your witnesses are blind.

11:08.140 --> 11:11.164
The fact is, you knew Orlando Costas.

11:11.165 --> 11:14.172
Yeah, I knew him once,
before he turned his back.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.453
When was the last time you heard from him?

11:15.454 --> 11:17.026
Not in years.
Hours.

11:17.027 --> 11:19.672
Just before he was killed,
Orlando called a burner cell,

11:19.673 --> 11:21.151
same phone that we found on you.

11:21.152 --> 11:24.604
So why don't you just admit to
it and save yourself 30 years?

11:24.671 --> 11:26.695
You had him break in to
Roy Montgomery's house

11:26.696 --> 11:27.988
and steal your cousin's case files,

11:27.989 --> 11:29.352
and then you shot him.

11:29.658 --> 11:31.811
What you got, chica, huh?

11:31.935 --> 11:33.214
Gun's not gonna be a match.

11:33.215 --> 11:35.274
So that leaves you with what, a phone call,

11:35.275 --> 11:37.798
and a couple of people who
saw a very common car?

11:38.343 --> 11:40.955
You know why you can't
pin this on me, chica?

11:41.164 --> 11:42.136
I wasn't there.

11:42.137 --> 11:43.683
The hell you weren't.

11:45.686 --> 11:47.432
That's gonna be ballistics.

11:48.767 --> 11:50.364
Last chance to make a deal.

11:54.315 --> 11:56.068
Book him on the drugs and weapons charge

11:56.069 --> 11:59.035
and tell the D.A. I'm gonna
want to file for murder one.

11:59.242 --> 12:00.417
It wasn't him.

12:00.658 --> 12:03.167
What do you mean, it wasn't him?

12:03.168 --> 12:04.985
The skin tissue that
Lanie was able to scrape

12:04.986 --> 12:06.899
from underneath our victim's fingernails,

12:07.315 --> 12:08.700
the lab was able to pull D.N.A.

12:08.701 --> 12:10.288
We ran it against Vicente.

12:10.425 --> 12:11.613
It's not a match.

12:11.776 --> 12:14.426
In fact, it wasn't a match
to anyone in the system.

12:14.427 --> 12:15.912
But it did match D.N.A. trace evidence

12:15.913 --> 12:17.492
found at another crime scene.

12:17.493 --> 12:19.556
Well, at least that's something.
What was the crime scene?

12:19.557 --> 12:20.708
It was a shooting.

12:22.144 --> 12:23.527
Beckett, it was your shooting.

12:24.462 --> 12:25.575
D.N.A. confirms that the man

12:25.576 --> 12:28.029
who killed Orlando Costas in that alley

12:28.219 --> 12:30.484
is the same man who put
a bullet in your heart.

12:50.392 --> 12:53.361
No leads for 11 months, and now this.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.114
Does Gates know?

12:57.506 --> 12:58.564
No.

12:58.650 --> 13:00.034
Then we don't tell her.

13:01.112 --> 13:03.052
If she finds out this is
a match to my shooting,

13:03.053 --> 13:04.694
she'll take me off the case.

13:06.309 --> 13:08.171
Maybe you should be off this case.

13:08.754 --> 13:10.687
They tried to kill you once, Kate.

13:10.688 --> 13:12.495
You keep going on this, they...

13:13.201 --> 13:14.610
What's to stop them from trying again?

13:14.611 --> 13:16.399
What's to stop them now?

13:16.924 --> 13:17.959
No.

13:18.504 --> 13:19.839
I've been waiting a year for this,

13:19.840 --> 13:22.409
and I'll be damned if I let
someone else screw it up.

13:38.916 --> 13:39.968
Hey, Javier.

13:41.873 --> 13:43.438
Man, this just feels wrong.

13:44.219 --> 13:45.561
We need to tell Gates.

13:47.449 --> 13:48.464
Why...

13:49.851 --> 13:51.341
So she can send Beckett home?

13:52.520 --> 13:53.710
You think that's gonna work?

13:53.711 --> 13:55.074
You think that's gonna stop her?

13:55.075 --> 13:56.895
She's gonna investigate this case, Kevin,

13:56.896 --> 13:58.666
whether she's on it or not.

13:59.954 --> 14:01.560
The least we can do

14:01.561 --> 14:03.979
is make sure that we have her back.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.004
Hello.

14:17.005 --> 14:19.633
I think you know why I'm
calling, Mr. Castle.

14:19.903 --> 14:21.005
It's you.

14:21.558 --> 14:23.803
Thank God. What the hell is going on?

14:24.063 --> 14:25.670
Why'd they break in to Montgomery's place?

14:25.671 --> 14:28.092
Well, most likely, it's a clean-up job.

14:28.161 --> 14:31.159
Making sure that Montgomery had
nothing else incriminating

14:31.160 --> 14:32.444
in his files.

14:32.587 --> 14:35.430
As long as Beckett drops her investigation,

14:35.602 --> 14:37.647
we still hold all the cards.

14:37.648 --> 14:39.919
No, she's already on to her shooter.

14:39.924 --> 14:41.228
She's not gonna let go.

14:41.229 --> 14:42.760
Then we have a problem.

14:43.365 --> 14:46.529
If she doesn't stop, they will retaliate.

14:46.530 --> 14:48.870
Now I can't control the situation

14:49.170 --> 14:50.902
if you can't control her.

15:07.261 --> 15:09.234
I got enough on the drug
and weapons charges

15:09.235 --> 15:12.037
to put you away for at least five years.

15:12.189 --> 15:14.664
Five years of your life...

15:25.722 --> 15:26.852
What's that worth?

15:27.982 --> 15:29.903
I know you didn't kill Orlando.

15:30.209 --> 15:30.941
But he called you,

15:30.942 --> 15:33.006
and you talked to him for two minutes,

15:33.007 --> 15:34.705
and you were in that alley.

15:37.052 --> 15:38.220
Why?

15:39.640 --> 15:41.441
There's nobody in here but you and me.

15:41.442 --> 15:42.706
There's no cameras,

15:42.707 --> 15:44.480
no microphones, no one's listening.

15:44.481 --> 15:46.963
I can make all those charges go away.

15:46.964 --> 15:48.843
Five years of your life back,

15:48.844 --> 15:50.923
but you gotta tell me what you know.

16:08.413 --> 16:09.762
He called last week.

16:10.032 --> 16:11.945
Talking about "Times were bad,"

16:12.335 --> 16:14.346
so I told him, "I can get you some work."

16:14.412 --> 16:17.031
But he knew if he came
back to the Cazadores,

16:17.603 --> 16:19.367
there'd be no leaving this time.

16:19.835 --> 16:21.225
And all he really wanted was a loan

16:21.226 --> 16:23.668
and could I help him out
for old times' sake.

16:24.929 --> 16:25.645
Did you give it to him?

16:25.646 --> 16:27.511
No. He begged me.

16:27.619 --> 16:29.051
Said he was good for it.

16:29.052 --> 16:30.543
Said he had something big coming up,

16:30.544 --> 16:31.715
something that'd make him whole.

16:31.716 --> 16:32.550
Did he say what?

16:32.551 --> 16:35.314
No, but that morning, my phone rings,

16:35.666 --> 16:37.734
and he said it'd all gone wrong,

16:37.843 --> 16:40.380
he was desperate, talking about
they were gonna kill him.

16:40.902 --> 16:41.692
Who's they?

16:41.693 --> 16:42.769
Don't know.

16:43.124 --> 16:44.395
But he was scared.

16:45.321 --> 16:46.846
Why did he call you?

16:46.874 --> 16:48.403
Protection, chica.

16:48.552 --> 16:50.210
He said if I helped him
out, he'd come back,

16:50.211 --> 16:51.924
and he knew that was the price.

16:52.242 --> 16:53.751
So I told him where to meet.

16:54.153 --> 16:57.098
But by the time I got
there, he was already dead.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.756
You told him where to meet?

16:58.757 --> 16:59.843
That's right.

16:59.844 --> 17:01.889
You didn't tell anyone else?
No.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.781
Did you see anything there?

17:05.390 --> 17:06.231
White guy,

17:06.232 --> 17:07.425
6'.

17:08.021 --> 17:10.646
Caught a glimpse before the
night swallowed him whole.

17:13.247 --> 17:15.056
They must have been
tapping Orlando's phone.

17:15.057 --> 17:16.386
That's the only way they got there first.

17:16.387 --> 17:18.954
But how did they know to
target Orlando for the job?

17:18.954 --> 17:20.036
Because he was desperate for money.

17:20.037 --> 17:21.459
Yeah, but how did they know that?

17:21.460 --> 17:22.494
How did they know his background?

17:22.496 --> 17:23.951
Because they knew him from the military.

17:23.952 --> 17:25.558
He was hired by somebody he knew.

17:25.559 --> 17:26.590
It's a place to start.

17:26.592 --> 17:29.291
And whoever's gotten close
to that secret is dead.

17:29.292 --> 17:31.301
I think it's clear, we're
in over our heads here.

17:31.302 --> 17:32.862
Speak for yourself, bro.

17:32.863 --> 17:34.234
Orlando's financials just came in.

17:34.235 --> 17:36.549
He was underwater and
overdrawn until last week

17:36.550 --> 17:38.962
when a wire transfer for
10 grand hit his account.

17:38.963 --> 17:40.890
Let me guess. Untraceable?

17:40.891 --> 17:41.657
So it's a dead end.

17:41.658 --> 17:42.824
The deposits are,

17:42.825 --> 17:44.988
but the debit withdrawals are not.

17:44.989 --> 17:45.856
Right when the money came in,

17:45.857 --> 17:47.411
Marisol started using it to pay bills.

17:47.412 --> 17:49.137
Wait. If Marisol knew about the money...

17:49.138 --> 17:51.061
Then she knew Orlando was up to something.

17:51.062 --> 17:52.295
She lied to us.

17:52.296 --> 17:54.049
Not only that, but according to the bank,

17:54.050 --> 17:55.923
she cleaned out the entire
account an hour ago.

17:55.924 --> 17:57.172
She's on the run.

18:09.425 --> 18:11.830
I've got a few questions for
you before you leave town,

18:11.831 --> 18:13.208
and this time,

18:13.315 --> 18:14.825
I want the truth.

18:19.206 --> 18:20.571
I'm telling you the truth.

18:20.572 --> 18:22.606
I didn't know anything about the money.

18:22.977 --> 18:23.812
Not until today.

18:23.813 --> 18:26.015
So why do we have debits against it

18:26.016 --> 18:28.454
the moment it appeared in your account?

18:28.955 --> 18:31.628
Orlando...
It was your card, Marisol.

18:31.629 --> 18:34.070
Who was Orlando working for?

18:34.974 --> 18:35.929
Do you know what's gonna happen

18:35.930 --> 18:37.732
if you don't cooperate?

18:38.525 --> 18:39.540
You're gonna go to jail

18:39.541 --> 18:41.444
and your kid's gonna go to foster care.

18:41.445 --> 18:42.569
Is that what you want?
Beckett...

18:42.570 --> 18:45.380
Marco on the streets,
enlisted by the Cazadores

18:45.381 --> 18:47.219
at age 10 like his father,

18:47.220 --> 18:49.731
dead in a gutter at 19!

18:49.732 --> 18:51.232
Pudrete en el infierno!

18:51.233 --> 18:53.743
Beckett...
That's enough.

18:53.744 --> 18:56.584
Orlando said it was someone
he knew from the service,

18:56.670 --> 18:58.189
someone dangerous.

18:58.684 --> 19:00.443
But it was just a one-off,

19:01.355 --> 19:03.574
a lot of money for an easy job.

19:04.121 --> 19:05.546
And we needed the money.

19:05.930 --> 19:07.069
What was the job?

19:07.070 --> 19:08.507
They needed files...

19:09.732 --> 19:11.446
from a dead cop's house.

19:11.939 --> 19:12.947
What files?

19:12.948 --> 19:15.924
All of them, any he could find,

19:16.251 --> 19:18.582
this guy from the service,
did you get a name?

19:18.583 --> 19:20.631
No.
Did you meet him?

19:20.826 --> 19:21.494
No.

19:21.495 --> 19:22.859
Did he ever call the house?

19:23.400 --> 19:25.056
He left notes for Orlando in the mail box

19:25.057 --> 19:26.472
with a time and place.

19:26.873 --> 19:29.512
They were coded so I-I wouldn't know where.

19:30.561 --> 19:32.093
But I was in the car once.

19:34.087 --> 19:35.343
I saw where they met.

19:36.512 --> 19:37.694
At a church

19:38.175 --> 19:39.831
over on State Street.

19:42.309 --> 19:42.983
Wednesday, you say?

19:42.984 --> 19:44.286
Yeah, around 3:00 P.M.

19:44.287 --> 19:46.071
He was meeting with someone.

19:47.007 --> 19:49.423
I'm sorry. I wish I could help.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.491
But we're open to the public,

19:52.212 --> 19:54.321
and we get a lot of
unfamiliar faces every day.

19:54.322 --> 19:56.130
We usually just leave
them to their prayers.

19:56.131 --> 19:58.166
If your donation box is any indication,

19:58.167 --> 20:00.694
it looks like being open to the
public comes with a price.

20:00.695 --> 20:03.553
Yes, well... it's not
the best neighborhood.

20:03.554 --> 20:06.168
We catch gang kids and the
homeless all the time,

20:06.272 --> 20:09.455
trying to take advantage of more
than just our outreach programs.

20:09.990 --> 20:11.457
How do you catch them?

20:13.184 --> 20:13.690
Here it is,

20:13.691 --> 20:15.119
3:00 P.M. Wednesday.

20:18.807 --> 20:19.935
There's Orlando.

20:26.626 --> 20:27.639
That's him.

20:28.937 --> 20:30.077
Damn it.

20:36.754 --> 20:38.799
Come on. Come on.

20:41.988 --> 20:43.065
Yes.

20:46.626 --> 20:48.183
So that's what you look like.

20:48.184 --> 20:50.085
I'm gonna run this through Army C.I.D.

20:50.086 --> 20:52.504
If they met in the military
someone in Orlando's old unit

20:52.505 --> 20:54.393
might be able to I.D. him.
No, no, we don't know who's involved

20:54.394 --> 20:55.806
and we don't know how high this goes.

20:55.807 --> 20:57.088
The minute we put this photo out there,

20:57.089 --> 20:58.964
these people are gonna know.
He's gonna disappear,

20:58.965 --> 21:00.128
and we'll never see him again.

21:00.129 --> 21:01.535
We have to do this one on our own.

21:01.536 --> 21:03.272
Beckett, that's impossible.

21:03.353 --> 21:04.164
All we have is a face...

21:04.165 --> 21:06.232
no name, no I.D., no way to find this guy.

21:06.233 --> 21:08.258
Then we will find a way to find him.

21:08.707 --> 21:10.276
I'm not gonna lose this lead.

21:13.961 --> 21:14.783
How are we supposed to investigate

21:14.784 --> 21:16.103
if we can't investigate?

21:17.123 --> 21:18.212
You heard the lady.

21:18.618 --> 21:19.747
We find a way.

21:24.400 --> 21:25.860
<i>You woke up the dragon.</i>

21:26.700 --> 21:29.835
<i>And this is much bigger,
than you realize.</i>

21:29.932 --> 21:31.230
<i>Kate!</i>

21:31.231 --> 21:32.789
<i>Don't die on me!</i>

21:32.790 --> 21:35.565
<i>- not hide from me.
- You got it wrong.</i>

21:35.850 --> 21:37.360
<i>You can not hide
from him before.</i>

21:37.365 --> 21:39.744
<i>- I do not know how, but come on it.
- I made a mistake.</i>

21:39.844 --> 21:40.829
<i>Who hired you to kill her?</i>

21:40.830 --> 21:42.869
<i>Forget it.
You'll never touch 'em.</i>

22:21.551 --> 22:22.262
Hey.

22:22.263 --> 22:23.255
Hey.

22:23.546 --> 22:25.630
I just got off the phone with Esposito.

22:25.631 --> 22:27.069
Our killer had a keychain,

22:27.070 --> 22:29.502
and he matched it to Eastway Car Rentals.

22:29.503 --> 22:31.758
That could be any one of a thousand cars.

22:31.759 --> 22:32.903
I know, it's a needle in a haystack,

22:32.904 --> 22:34.099
but at least it's a haystack,

22:34.100 --> 22:36.230
and they keep most of
their licenses on file.

22:36.231 --> 22:38.233
Kate...
Yeah, he's probably using a fake I.D.

22:38.234 --> 22:39.749
But we should be able to
narrow it down from there.

22:39.750 --> 22:41.658
Kate.
What's wrong?

22:43.962 --> 22:45.197
You, um...

22:46.353 --> 22:47.633
You have to stop.

22:48.499 --> 22:50.925
This investigation, you... you have to stop.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.601
Castle, we already talked about this.

22:53.602 --> 22:55.792
I'm fine. I'm in control.

22:55.793 --> 22:57.489
No, you're not.

22:58.577 --> 22:59.724
They are.

23:00.937 --> 23:03.811
And if you don't stop,
they will kill you, Kate.

23:05.481 --> 23:07.087
What are you talking about?

23:08.827 --> 23:11.207
Before Montgomery went into that hangar,

23:11.522 --> 23:13.589
he sent a package to someone,

23:13.590 --> 23:16.257
someone... he trusted.

23:17.450 --> 23:19.017
It contained information

23:19.018 --> 23:21.732
damaging to the person behind all this.

23:23.466 --> 23:25.828
Montgomery was trying to protect you.

23:26.372 --> 23:29.375
But the package didn't arrive
until after you'd been shot.

23:31.004 --> 23:32.395
Montgomery's friend...

23:33.340 --> 23:35.172
struck a deal with them.

23:36.991 --> 23:37.946
If they left you alone,

23:37.947 --> 23:39.758
that package and the information inside

23:39.759 --> 23:41.635
would never see the light of day.

23:41.908 --> 23:45.110
But they made one condition...
you had to back off.

23:47.295 --> 23:49.993
And that's the reason you're alive, Kate,

23:50.678 --> 23:51.947
because you stopped.

23:54.142 --> 23:55.445
How do you know this?

23:58.074 --> 23:59.055
In order for the deal to work,

23:59.056 --> 24:01.830
someone had to make sure
you weren't pursuing it.

24:04.093 --> 24:05.506
Are you a part of this?

24:05.787 --> 24:07.651
I was just trying to keep you safe.

24:16.297 --> 24:17.938
By lying to me

24:17.939 --> 24:20.351
about the most important thing in my life?

24:20.352 --> 24:22.457
That lie was the only thing
that was protecting you.

24:22.458 --> 24:24.113
Castle, I didn't need protection.

24:24.114 --> 24:26.190
I needed a lead,

24:26.191 --> 24:28.801
and you sat on it for a year.

24:31.059 --> 24:33.605
Now who is this person? How do I find him?

24:33.694 --> 24:35.653
He's a-a voice on the phone.

24:35.654 --> 24:38.344
He's a shadow in a parking garage.

24:40.487 --> 24:41.678
You met with him?

24:42.628 --> 24:44.704
How do you know that he's
not behind my mom's murder?

24:44.705 --> 24:46.783
How do you know that he's not involved?

24:46.784 --> 24:48.975
And how the hell could you do this?

24:50.683 --> 24:51.923
Because I love you.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.577
But you already know that, don't you?

24:59.200 --> 25:00.273
You've known for about a year.

25:01.721 --> 25:02.442
Are you kidding me?

25:02.443 --> 25:03.986
You're actually bringing this up right now,

25:04.670 --> 25:06.437
after you told me that
you just betrayed me?

25:08.509 --> 25:09.282
Kate, listen to me...

25:09.283 --> 25:11.820
Listen to you? Why should I listen to you?

25:11.821 --> 25:14.970
How I am even supposed to
trust anything that you say?

25:15.146 --> 25:15.830
How are you s...

25:18.209 --> 25:20.498
Because of everything we've
been through together!

25:20.660 --> 25:22.544
Four years, I've been right here.

25:23.435 --> 25:25.702
Four years just waiting for
you to just open your eyes,

25:25.703 --> 25:27.023
to see that I'm right here

25:29.442 --> 25:31.284
and that I'm more than a partner.

25:33.635 --> 25:35.518
Every morning, I-I bring
you a cup of coffee

25:35.519 --> 25:37.763
just so I could see a smile on your face

25:37.764 --> 25:39.233
because I think you are the most...

25:40.557 --> 25:41.333
remarkable...

25:43.235 --> 25:44.009
maddening...

25:44.869 --> 25:45.722
challenging...

25:46.978 --> 25:48.705
frustrating person I have ever met.

25:51.557 --> 25:53.000
And I love you, Kate, and if...

25:53.362 --> 25:55.708
that means anything to you,

25:56.604 --> 25:59.217
if you care about me at
all, just don't do this.

26:00.964 --> 26:02.097
If I care about you?

26:02.098 --> 26:04.188
Castle, you cut a deal for my life

26:04.298 --> 26:06.110
like I was some kind of a child.

26:06.617 --> 26:08.737
My life, mine...

26:09.579 --> 26:11.053
You don't get to decide.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.013
You keep going with this,

26:15.059 --> 26:16.147
they're gonna decide.

26:16.959 --> 26:18.245
They're gonna come for you, Kate.

26:18.546 --> 26:19.506
Let them come.

26:20.194 --> 26:22.303
They sent Coonan, and he is dead.

26:22.509 --> 26:24.815
They sent Lockwood, and he is dead.

26:24.870 --> 26:26.966
And I am still here, Castle,

26:27.274 --> 26:28.463
and I am ready.

26:29.520 --> 26:30.306
Ready for what,

26:31.212 --> 26:32.522
to-to die for your cause?

26:32.523 --> 26:34.780
This isn't a murder
investigation anymore, Kate.

26:34.813 --> 26:36.138
They've turned it into a war.

26:37.114 --> 26:39.998
If they want a war, then
I will bring them a war,

26:40.504 --> 26:42.078
straight to their doorsteps.

26:46.376 --> 26:48.452
Well, I guess there's just
nothing I can say, is there?

26:50.138 --> 26:51.065
Okay, um...

26:53.308 --> 26:54.481
Yeah, you're right, Kate,

26:54.995 --> 26:55.757
it's your life.

26:57.198 --> 26:58.267
You can throw it away if you want,

26:58.268 --> 26:59.918
but I'm not gonna stick
around and watch you,

26:59.919 --> 27:01.033
so this is, uh...

27:03.085 --> 27:03.790
over.

27:05.015 --> 27:05.795
I'm done.

27:34.499 --> 27:35.211
Everything okay?

27:37.446 --> 27:39.633
Yeah. Fine. How's your speech coming?

27:39.634 --> 27:40.790
I have watched or read

27:40.791 --> 27:42.511
every graduation address ever written

27:42.512 --> 27:45.018
and compiled all the best
advice into one speech,

27:45.295 --> 27:46.354
and then I read it out loud.

27:47.355 --> 27:48.494
And guess what I sounded like.

27:48.900 --> 27:49.800
Like a pompous ass.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.060
I'm 18 years old. What the hell do I know?

27:53.831 --> 27:55.378
Hey, look, everything you know,

27:55.379 --> 27:57.151
everything you will know is...

27:58.051 --> 27:59.039
is what's true for you.

28:00.519 --> 28:01.939
All I know is, everything's changing.

28:02.618 --> 28:03.787
Everything's going to be different,

28:05.708 --> 28:06.585
and I'm so scared.

28:09.062 --> 28:09.868
Of what?

28:11.542 --> 28:12.425
Moving on.

28:15.266 --> 28:16.092
Write about that.

28:17.328 --> 28:18.372
That feels true.

29:07.045 --> 29:07.776
Where's Castle?

29:07.978 --> 29:08.844
He's off the team.

29:11.894 --> 29:12.606
So what do we got?

29:13.074 --> 29:15.237
Eastway rented 700 cars last Wednesday.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.218
We believe our suspect
is going under the name

29:17.219 --> 29:18.257
Cole Maddox.

29:18.366 --> 29:19.650
He rented out of J.F.K.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.192
It's a Kansas driver's license.

29:21.499 --> 29:23.157
Now we did some digging.
It's a cover I.D.

29:23.158 --> 29:24.003
Did he return the car?

29:24.004 --> 29:25.370
No, but...

29:25.723 --> 29:26.899
Eastway maintains

29:26.900 --> 29:28.830
GPS tracking on all of its equipment,

29:28.831 --> 29:31.441
so we tracked it to the Lower East Side

29:31.871 --> 29:33.693
to a 1-block radius somewhere along here.

29:34.656 --> 29:35.695
All right, you stay on grid.

29:35.757 --> 29:36.651
Let us know if he moves.

29:36.652 --> 29:37.985
Esposito, you're coming with me.

29:39.286 --> 29:39.962
What are you doing?

29:40.311 --> 29:41.423
You want to do this, you do it right.

29:41.991 --> 29:44.217
You put a team on that car and
you bring backup with you.

29:44.279 --> 29:45.516
Ryan, this whole thing started

29:45.517 --> 29:47.326
because of a group of corrupt cops.

29:47.835 --> 29:49.317
How do you know there
aren't more out there?

29:50.426 --> 29:52.008
We're about an inch away
from catching this guy,

29:52.335 --> 29:54.652
and I'm not gonna blow it by
advertising our next move.

29:54.653 --> 29:55.466
With all due respect,

29:55.601 --> 29:56.825
this guy put a bullet in your heart

29:56.826 --> 29:59.162
and then he disappeared into the ether.

29:59.404 --> 30:01.280
You cannot go in there unprepared.

30:01.281 --> 30:02.093
Unprepared?

30:03.481 --> 30:06.562
I've been preparing for
this for the past 13 years.

30:11.155 --> 30:11.805
Hey, Javier...

30:13.241 --> 30:14.322
Man, don't let her do this.

30:14.884 --> 30:15.760
It's too big of a risk.

30:17.539 --> 30:18.358
It's all good, bro.

30:18.659 --> 30:19.415
We got this.

30:23.311 --> 30:25.200
Come on. We don't want
to miss her speech...

30:26.005 --> 30:27.622
or the entire graduation.

30:27.844 --> 30:28.740
I'm almost ready.

30:49.742 --> 30:51.259
Hey, we got him.

30:51.774 --> 30:54.699
The doorman at the residency hotel
across the way I.D.'ed the car.

30:54.718 --> 30:56.184
And the front desk clerk confirms

30:56.185 --> 30:57.982
that Mr. Maddox is here on a 1-month lease.

30:58.130 --> 30:59.467
They've agreed to let us in his room.

31:00.781 --> 31:01.432
Get out of the way.

31:08.622 --> 31:09.171
Clear.

31:09.193 --> 31:09.811
Clear.

31:11.069 --> 31:11.808
Montgomery's files.

31:16.187 --> 31:16.939
His contact list?

31:17.962 --> 31:19.962
What the hell were they looking for?

31:22.483 --> 31:23.731
Not what. Who.

31:24.486 --> 31:26.055
They grabbed Montgomery's wedding album.

31:26.296 --> 31:28.080
Why?
They're looking for someone that he knew.

31:30.947 --> 31:31.748
Maybe they found him.

31:33.081 --> 31:33.912
We gotta get out of here.

31:34.064 --> 31:35.102
I'm gonna call for backup.

31:35.182 --> 31:36.082
We'll set up in the lobby...

33:11.486 --> 33:13.145
Just tell me who's behind this.

33:14.565 --> 33:16.213
You're wasting your time, detective.

33:17.133 --> 33:18.891
You have no idea what you're up against.

33:20.948 --> 33:21.687
Neither do you.

33:41.025 --> 33:41.696
Actually...

33:42.802 --> 33:44.392
We know exactly who we're up against.

34:01.321 --> 34:02.076
Help!

34:04.234 --> 34:05.508
Oh! Oh, God.

34:07.676 --> 34:08.357
No!

34:09.077 --> 34:11.135
Oh, not like this. Come on.

34:15.938 --> 34:17.120
Come on. No!

34:36.911 --> 34:37.569
Castle.

34:55.898 --> 34:56.484
Beckett!

34:56.882 --> 34:57.765
Castle!

34:57.873 --> 34:59.812
Beckett! Castle, I'm here!

35:00.726 --> 35:01.408
No!

35:01.824 --> 35:03.874
Oh, God. Castle!

35:04.124 --> 35:04.984
Beckett, hang on!

35:07.286 --> 35:08.065
Castle!

35:08.825 --> 35:09.552
Beckett!

35:20.075 --> 35:20.676
Castle?

35:28.912 --> 35:29.998
Withholding evidence,

35:30.215 --> 35:32.319
lying to a superior officer...

35:32.617 --> 35:35.888
What you did dishonors this
city and dishonors the badge.

35:36.057 --> 35:37.982
Not only are you off this investigation,

35:38.022 --> 35:39.850
I'm putting you both on
administrative leave

35:39.851 --> 35:41.579
effective immediately.
Sir...

35:41.580 --> 35:42.679
Don't you "Sir" me.

35:43.100 --> 35:44.944
You don't deserve to wear the uniform.

35:45.515 --> 35:47.178
Now hand over your badges and guns.

35:56.327 --> 35:57.292
Detective Beckett.

36:20.724 --> 36:21.547
Keep it.

36:22.758 --> 36:23.489
I resign.

36:28.936 --> 36:30.241
There's a universal truth

36:30.386 --> 36:31.419
we all have to face...

36:33.345 --> 36:34.675
whether we want to or not.

36:36.653 --> 36:38.781
Everything eventually ends.

36:40.696 --> 36:42.390
As much as I've looked forward to this day,

36:43.135 --> 36:44.717
I've always disliked endings...

36:51.220 --> 36:52.150
The last day of summer...

36:54.766 --> 36:56.086
The final chapter of a great book...

37:01.762 --> 37:03.165
Parting ways with a close friend.

37:06.385 --> 37:08.915
But endings are inevitable.

37:11.992 --> 37:12.553
Javi.

37:14.791 --> 37:15.437
I had to.

37:17.663 --> 37:18.315
Leaves fall.

37:20.414 --> 37:21.300
You close the book.

37:29.923 --> 37:30.932
You say good-bye.

37:36.988 --> 37:38.650
Today is one of those days for us.

37:40.613 --> 37:43.178
Today we say good-bye to
everything that was familiar,

37:44.008 --> 37:45.412
everything that was comfortable.

37:50.645 --> 37:51.613
We're moving on.

37:58.932 --> 38:00.348
But just because we're leaving,

38:00.923 --> 38:01.666
and that hurts...

38:04.687 --> 38:05.883
There are some people

38:06.428 --> 38:07.761
who are so much a part of us

38:08.705 --> 38:10.237
they'll be with us no matter what.

38:13.311 --> 38:15.542
They are our solid ground...

38:17.663 --> 38:18.553
Our North Star,

38:20.493 --> 38:23.577
and the small clear voices in our hearts

38:23.808 --> 38:26.568
that will be with us... always.

38:46.359 --> 38:47.931
No, Alexis, I'll be fine.

38:47.941 --> 38:49.861
I got a thousand cable
channels, I got my Xbox.

38:49.996 --> 38:51.033
You have fun.

38:52.211 --> 38:54.329
I will not worry about you
until lunchtime tomorrow.

38:55.962 --> 38:56.779
I love you, too.

40:00.875 --> 40:01.705
Beckett, what do you want?

40:03.032 --> 40:03.619
You.

40:14.338 --> 40:15.841
I'm so sorry, Castle.

40:17.513 --> 40:18.283
I'm so sorry.

40:20.709 --> 40:21.587
I'm so sorry.

40:29.246 --> 40:29.888
What happened?

40:31.355 --> 40:33.392
He got away, and I didn't care.

40:36.068 --> 40:37.049
I almost died

40:38.079 --> 40:39.952
and all I could think about was you.

40:42.194 --> 40:43.169
I just want you.

41:45.780 --> 41:46.484
Mister...

41:47.214 --> 41:47.868
Smith?

41:49.842 --> 41:50.508
Who are you?

41:54.217 --> 41:55.512
You've been a very hard man to find.

41:56.289 --> 41:57.127
What do you want?

41:57.421 --> 41:58.821
You have some sensitive information

41:58.822 --> 41:59.812
about my employer,

42:00.142 --> 42:01.385
information that you've been using

42:01.386 --> 42:02.701
to protect detective Beckett.

42:02.881 --> 42:03.843
Are you forgetting...

42:05.036 --> 42:05.893
we have a deal?

42:06.223 --> 42:08.411
No. What you had was blackmail.

42:09.104 --> 42:11.989
Now you're gonna tell me where
all that information is,

42:12.237 --> 42:13.054
and after you do,

42:14.450 --> 42:15.979
I'm gonna put Kate Beckett in the ground

42:16.121 --> 42:16.998
once and for all.
