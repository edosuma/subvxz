(crunching)

10:24.874 --> 10:26.542
(grunts)

10:26.626 --> 10:29.587
I think you're taking unfair
advantage of my generous offer.

10:29.670 --> 10:32.006
-Shut up!
-(labored breathing)

10:32.089 --> 10:35.217
He can't just eat peanuts, Dad.
He needs plants to live.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.094
Plants, eh?

10:39.221 --> 10:41.098
(squirrels chittering)

10:43.684 --> 10:45.728
Strip the bark now, Stampy.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.605
Hey, any more arboretums
around here?

10:47.688 --> 10:48.773
No!

10:52.276 --> 10:56.364
(Homer gasps) That bird!
He's killing the elephant! Stop him!

10:56.447 --> 10:58.741
No, Dad,
he's grooming him.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.576
Grooming him, eh?

11:02.828 --> 11:04.789
Oh, Homer, there's
a bird on your head.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.083
I know.
He's grooming me.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.461
Mm, elephant fresh.

11:10.544 --> 11:14.757
(several dogs barking)

11:14.840 --> 11:16.759
(Stampy trumpets)

11:16.842 --> 11:19.470
(silence)

11:19.553 --> 11:21.639
(straining)

11:23.349 --> 11:25.393
Good night, Stampy.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.314
(sniffing)

11:30.398 --> 11:32.274
(Bart sighs)

11:33.776 --> 11:36.654
(yawns, grunts)

11:37.780 --> 11:39.782
Uh-- Ahem.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.287
Thanks, Bud.
Appreciate it.

11:47.581 --> 11:50.334
-Hmm.
-Taught Stampy any tricks yet, Bart?

11:50.418 --> 11:52.795
Nah. He doesn't wanna learn,
and I don't wanna teach him.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.422
We get along fine.

11:54.505 --> 11:58.134
-(heavy panting)
-Hey, what's with them?

11:58.217 --> 12:00.219
I think they're trying
to get some attention.

12:00.302 --> 12:03.013
Oh. Good luck!

12:03.097 --> 12:05.808
Look at these bills.
"Chain for elephant."

12:05.891 --> 12:09.603
"Shots for elephant."
"Oversized decorative poncho"!

12:09.687 --> 12:12.732
Technically, it's for a giraffe,
but I think I can let it out a little.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.276
Well, these bills will have to be
paid out of your allowance.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.528
You'll have to raise my allowance
to about $1,000 a week.

12:17.611 --> 12:20.948
-Then that's what I'll do, smart guy.
-(doorbell rings)

12:21.031 --> 12:24.827
-Can we see the elephant?
-We'll pay you money.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.538
For the ninth time, no!

12:27.621 --> 12:29.540
(doorbell rings)

12:29.623 --> 12:32.668
Wait a minute.
This gives me an idea.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.716
Mm, here's
a better sign, Dad.

12:38.799 --> 12:39.925
I don't have time
to read it.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.260
Just give me
the gist of it, son.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.763
(playful chattering)

12:47.183 --> 12:49.351
-(grunts)
-Your kid flew five feet.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.853
That counts as a ride.
Two bucks.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.521
That was never five feet.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.940
That animal of yours
is certainly bad-tempered.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.567
Yeah, well, you'd be
grumpy too

12:56.650 --> 12:58.194
if you were taken out
of your natural habitat

12:58.277 --> 13:01.197
and gawked at by a bunch
of slack-jawed yokels.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.700
Hey, ma, look at that
pointy-hairded little girl. (guffaws)

13:06.494 --> 13:07.912
You guys don't
understand Stampy.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.663
He's just like me.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.791
We're a pair of jokers,
and both of us are wild.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.627
We don't take nothing
from nobody. (sighs)

13:14.710 --> 13:17.129
(laughs)
Smithers!

13:17.213 --> 13:20.758
This reminds me of that fat man
I used to ride to work.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.551
-(groaning)
-(door closes)

13:22.635 --> 13:25.346
Look at this, Marge.
$58 and all of it profit!

13:25.429 --> 13:28.390
I'm the smartest businessman
in the world.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.393
Stampy's food bill
today was $300.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.772
Marge, please, don't humiliate me
in front of the money.

13:34.855 --> 13:38.818
(humming)

13:38.901 --> 13:41.487
(customers reacting
negatively)

13:41.570 --> 13:43.405
(car doors slamming,
tires screeching)

13:43.489 --> 13:46.158
(vehicles departing)

13:46.242 --> 13:48.494
Um, Milhouse saw the elephant
twice

13:48.577 --> 13:49.870
and rode him once, right?

13:49.954 --> 13:52.331
Yes, but we paid you
four dollars.

13:52.414 --> 13:55.125
Well, that was under
our old price structure.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.294
Under our new
price structure,

13:57.378 --> 14:00.881
your bill comes
to a total of $700.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.634
Now, you've already
paid me four dollars,

14:03.717 --> 14:08.097
so that's just $696 more
that you owe me.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.182
Get off our property.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.434
This town
is full of deadbeats.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.311
We can't afford this elephant.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.313
No, Dad, he's my friend.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.440
Sorry, Bart.
I'm gonna have to sell him.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.359
♪♪ (music playing)

14:23.654 --> 14:24.780
(roars)

14:24.864 --> 14:26.866
Well, sir,
I'll be honest with ya.

14:26.949 --> 14:30.661
I need a large African elephant,
and I need it today.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.705
But I'm afraid this just
isn't what I'm looking for.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.623
What do you mean?
It's an elephant, isn't it?

14:34.707 --> 14:38.294
Well, it is and it isn't,
if you understand what I mean.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.755
He likes peanuts.

14:41.839 --> 14:46.135
Our wildlife refuge is the ideal
environment for your elephant.

14:46.218 --> 14:49.138
Thousands of acres
of simulated African savannah.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.681
It's perfect, Dad.

14:50.764 --> 14:53.642
I only have two questions:
How much? And give it to me.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.936
Well, we really can't
offer you any money.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.189
-We're a nonprofit organization.
-So, your bid is zero?

14:59.273 --> 15:01.442
-Well, we'd like to think of it as--
-Thank you.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.569
-You know, I really think--
-Thank you.

15:05.529 --> 15:08.282
Mr. Simpson, I think you'll find
this amount more than fair.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.910
Dad, I think
he's an ivory dealer.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.120
His boots are ivory.
His hat is ivory.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.581
And I'm pretty sure
that check is ivory.

15:15.664 --> 15:19.960
Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory
is less likely to hurt Stampy

15:20.044 --> 15:22.755
than a guy whose
ivory supplies are low.

15:22.838 --> 15:27.593
(growling)
We love... you.

15:27.676 --> 15:28.969
(meows)

15:29.053 --> 15:31.555
-Mr. Blackheart?
-Yes, my pretty.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.683
-Are you an ivory dealer?
-(laughs)

15:34.767 --> 15:37.561
Little girl, I've had
lots of jobs in my day--

15:37.645 --> 15:41.941
Whale hunter, seal clubber,
president of the Fox network--

15:42.024 --> 15:43.525
And, like most people,

15:43.609 --> 15:45.110
yeah, I've dealt
a little ivory.

15:45.194 --> 15:48.322
Dad, you can't do this.
Stampy is my friend.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.908
Don't worry, son.
I'll get you a new elephant.

15:50.991 --> 15:53.202
-I'll take that one too.
-Done.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.286
I'll be back in
the morning to pick up Stampy.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.621
Here's the keys.

15:55.704 --> 15:58.624
-Elephants don't have keys.
-I'll just keep these then.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.918
Don't worry, Stampy.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.712
I won't let Homer sell you
to that ivory dealer.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.547
You and I are gonna
run away together.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.634
We'll keep to the back roads
and make our way south.

16:08.717 --> 16:12.596
Then, if I know my geography,
it's just 12 miles to Africa.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.182
Okay, bud, very quietly,
let's just sneak through--

16:15.265 --> 16:16.266
(grunts)

16:16.350 --> 16:17.810
Stampy!

16:17.893 --> 16:19.478
(trumpets)

16:21.855 --> 16:25.192
(gasps) Oh, it's the four elephants
of the apocalypse.

16:25.275 --> 16:28.153
-That's horsemen, Ned.
-Well, getting closer.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.576
Mom, Dad,
Bart and Stampy are gone!

16:34.660 --> 16:36.537
Oh, my Lord!

16:36.620 --> 16:39.415
I bet it's because of that horrible
ivory dealer, Dad.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.000
He took Bart too?

16:41.083 --> 16:43.794
That wasn't part of
our deal, Blackheart!

16:43.877 --> 16:46.964
That wasn't part!

16:49.717 --> 16:51.301
Piece of cake.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.929
All we have to do is follow
the path of destruction.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.600
Oh, stupid tornado!

16:58.684 --> 17:00.227
(laughs)
Look.

17:00.310 --> 17:02.229
It got Patty and Selma.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.066
(groans) I feel it
all the way up my skirt.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.192
Ditto.

17:10.696 --> 17:11.655
(trumpets)

17:11.739 --> 17:12.614
Whoa!

17:13.907 --> 17:15.117
Whoa!

17:18.829 --> 17:21.206
(chuckles)
Yeah, right, lady.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.834
An elephant ran through
your front yard. Okay.

17:23.917 --> 17:27.337
Wiggum. Yeah, right,
mister. Mm-hmm.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.382
An elephant just knocked over
your mailbox. Okay.

17:30.466 --> 17:33.343
Wiggum.
Yeah, right, buddy.

17:33.427 --> 17:36.638
Liquor store robbery,
officer down. Sure.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.767
And I'm Edward G. Robinson.
Waah!

17:43.103 --> 17:45.522
(cheering)

17:45.606 --> 17:47.608
(trumpeting)

17:48.734 --> 17:50.652
(jeering)

17:53.781 --> 17:54.823
(trumpets)

17:54.907 --> 17:56.325
Whoa!

17:56.408 --> 17:58.077
This is the moment
we've feared, people.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.912
Many of you thought
it would never happen,

17:59.995 --> 18:03.499
but I insisted we spend two hours
every morning training for it.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.626
You all thought I was mad.

18:05.709 --> 18:08.462
Many of you requested to be
transferred to another peanut factory.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.547
-But now, we--
-(trumpets)

18:14.885 --> 18:16.845
Stampy!

18:16.929 --> 18:19.848
Stampy, where are
you, boy?

18:19.932 --> 18:22.643
-(trumpeting)
-Huh?

18:22.726 --> 18:25.104
(panting)
(trumpeting)

18:25.187 --> 18:28.565
FEMALE VOICE:<i> These prehistoric</i>
<i>creatures blundered into the tar pits,</i>

18:28.649 --> 18:31.819
<i>which preserved their skeletons</i>
<i>in showroom condition.</i>

18:31.902 --> 18:35.489
Oh. He's gone forever.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.741
(loud trumpeting)

18:37.825 --> 18:39.284
(gasps)
Stampy!

18:40.994 --> 18:43.413
Mm.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.124
Huh?

18:45.207 --> 18:48.127
Oh, you're lonely for
other elephants, aren't you?

18:50.254 --> 18:51.755
-D'oh!
-A deer!

18:51.839 --> 18:53.757
A female deer.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.510
Son, you're okay!

18:56.593 --> 18:59.388
And you led us
to the precious ivory.

18:59.471 --> 19:02.724
And, of course, your lovable pet,
who it's connected to.

19:02.808 --> 19:06.353
Dad, I can't let you sell him.
Stampy and I are friends.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.147
Ow!

19:08.230 --> 19:11.024
Anyway, I want him to go
to that animal refuge.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.526
Forget it!

19:12.609 --> 19:15.028
That elephant cost me
thousands of dollars.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.906
Dad, how would you like to be
sold to an ivory dealer?

19:17.990 --> 19:19.908
-I'd like it fine.
-Even if he killed you

19:19.992 --> 19:22.244
and made your teeth
into piano keys?

19:22.327 --> 19:24.037
Yes, of course I would.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.206
Who wouldn't like that,
to be part of the music scene?

19:26.290 --> 19:28.834
-Dad, you're sinking!
-Huh?

19:28.917 --> 19:31.420
-Get a rope, Bart.
-No, that's okay.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.881
I'm pretty sure
I can struggle my way out.

19:33.964 --> 19:37.634
First, I'll just reach in
and pull my legs out.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.721
Now I'll pull my arms out
with my face.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.723
Mm.
(gurgling)

19:42.806 --> 19:45.225
-Dad!
-Homey!

19:45.309 --> 19:47.186
Stampy, quick!
Pull him out!

19:49.980 --> 19:51.732
Thanks, Stampy.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.277
Ow!

19:57.487 --> 19:59.573
(gasping)

19:59.656 --> 20:03.327
Ah, I'm alive!
I'm alive!

20:03.410 --> 20:06.788
And I owe it all
to this feisty feline.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.790
Dad, feline means cat.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.501
Elephant, honey.
It's an elephant.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.546
And I'm sure he'll make
a grand piano.

20:14.630 --> 20:17.382
-BOTH: Dad!
-Oh.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.927
I guess it wouldn't be
right to sell Stampy

20:20.010 --> 20:21.970
after he saved my life.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.431
And the boy seems to have some
sort of relationship with him.

20:24.514 --> 20:27.309
-Thanks, Dad.
-On the other hand,

20:27.392 --> 20:29.645
who's to say
what's right these days,

20:29.728 --> 20:33.482
what with all our modern ideas...
and products?

20:36.360 --> 20:38.904
All right. We'll give the stupid elephant
to the stupid animal refuge.

20:38.987 --> 20:41.782
BOTH: Yea!

20:41.865 --> 20:45.244
Uh, Mom,
we're stuck to Dad.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.870
(groans)

20:46.954 --> 20:48.789
This is just what happened
at the caramel factory.

20:48.872 --> 20:51.208
-Ow!
-Ow, my hair!

20:51.291 --> 20:52.876
(grunting)

20:52.960 --> 20:55.420
Mmm, caramel.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.465
(trumpets)

20:58.548 --> 21:00.425
So long, Stampy.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.428
I know you're gonna like it here.
No, Stampy, no!

21:03.512 --> 21:05.847
(trumpets)

21:05.931 --> 21:09.476
(chuckles)
Oh, thanks, boy.

21:09.559 --> 21:11.895
-(roars)
-Whoa! Whoa, boy!

21:11.979 --> 21:14.856
Wh-whoa!

(Bart laughs)

21:24.241 --> 21:27.452
Attaboy, Stampy.
Butt him once for me.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.997
Gosh, I thought he'd be happier
in his true habitat.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.999
Oh, I think he is.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.459
Then why is he attacking
all those other elephants?

21:34.543 --> 21:37.838
Well, animals are a lot
like people, Mrs. Simpson.

21:37.921 --> 21:39.589
-Some of them act badly
-Stampy!

21:39.673 --> 21:41.842
Because they had a hard life
or have been mistreated.

21:41.925 --> 21:46.054
But, like people,
some of them are just jerks.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.681
Stop that, Mr. Simpson.

21:47.764 --> 21:49.182
(grunting)

22:44.654 --> 22:46.198
Shh!
