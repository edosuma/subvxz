WEBVTT

00:02.790 --> 00:03.990
Your sister told me

00:03.990 --> 00:06.410
you're really good
at this sort of thing.

00:06.410 --> 00:07.330
I try.

00:07.330 --> 00:10.990
So, Lin told me that one of
your friends went missing?

00:10.990 --> 00:12.910
Uh, her name is Maria Rodriguez.

00:12.910 --> 00:14.330
I haven't talked to her
in four days.

00:14.330 --> 00:17.700
Have you checked with
her family, gone by her place?

00:17.700 --> 00:22.200
Well, that's where it gets
complicated.

00:22.200 --> 00:26.410
You see,
I haven't actually met Maria

00:26.410 --> 00:27.580
in person.

00:27.580 --> 00:28.750
We met online

00:28.750 --> 00:32.330
in the comments section
of a news site.

00:32.330 --> 00:33.080
Started exchanging PMs.

00:33.080 --> 00:35.660
Eventually got friendly enough
that she gave me her real name

00:35.660 --> 00:37.160
and that she lived in the city.

00:37.160 --> 00:38.410
We'd chat every day,

00:38.410 --> 00:40.660
and then, four days ago,
she just went silent.

00:40.660 --> 00:43.540
Could be she just got busy.

00:43.990 --> 00:46.080
No, I don't think so.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.990
Last time we talked, she said

00:47.990 --> 00:49.990
that she was dealing
with something.

00:49.990 --> 00:51.990
Some problem.

00:51.990 --> 00:53.830
She didn't go
into details, but...

00:53.830 --> 00:56.660
I got the impression
that she was in trouble.

00:56.660 --> 00:57.620
Now she's gone.

00:57.620 --> 01:00.120
I don't think
that's a coincidence.

01:00.790 --> 01:02.950
Mr. Clary, Lin told me
that you're one of

01:02.950 --> 01:04.870
the best real estate agents
at her firm.

01:04.870 --> 01:08.250
So I'm assuming that
you're fairly well off.

01:08.250 --> 01:11.000
Are you familiar
with the term "catfishing"?

01:12.080 --> 01:13.120
You meet a woman online.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.620
She strikes up a friendship.

01:14.620 --> 01:17.250
After a while, she hints
that she's having trouble

01:17.250 --> 01:18.950
and needs money.

01:19.990 --> 01:21.410
No, Maria's
not like that.

01:21.410 --> 01:22.990
In fact, I offered her money

01:22.990 --> 01:25.990
to help her out of the jam
that she was in.

01:25.990 --> 01:27.950
She never responded.

01:28.330 --> 01:30.330
Look, I'm...
(clears throat)

01:30.330 --> 01:31.990
really worried about her.

01:31.990 --> 01:33.700
I just want you to look into it.

01:33.700 --> 01:36.410
You don't even need
to tell me where she is.

01:36.410 --> 01:40.040
I just... just want
to know that she's safe.

01:41.950 --> 01:43.290
So, this Maria Rodriguez,

01:43.290 --> 01:45.580
she's a resident of
New York, is she?

01:45.580 --> 01:47.000
As far as the client knows.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.410
The problem is,
it's a pretty common name.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.870
Yeah.
She's one of...

01:50.870 --> 01:52.830
200 in a 30-mile radius.

01:52.830 --> 01:56.580
But your Maria is late 20s,
early 30s, isn't she?

01:56.580 --> 01:58.990
That should narrow the field
a bit, surely.

01:58.990 --> 02:01.790
Oh, to about
three dozen candidates.

02:01.790 --> 02:03.370
That's still a lot of people.

02:03.370 --> 02:04.580
Hmm.
Any advice?

02:04.580 --> 02:06.580
Well, I needn't remind you that

02:06.580 --> 02:07.990
the vast majority

02:07.990 --> 02:08.990
of detective work is work.

02:08.990 --> 02:13.040
The, uh, dogged drudgery
of chasing down every lead,

02:13.040 --> 02:16.700
upending every chestnut shell
to find that

02:16.700 --> 02:18.040
metaphorical pea.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.620
I was hoping for
a more elegant solution

02:20.620 --> 02:22.200
than knocking on the door

02:22.200 --> 02:24.410
of every Maria Rodriguez
in New York.

02:24.410 --> 02:26.040
What is that? A catapult?

02:26.040 --> 02:27.410
Uh, technically,

02:27.410 --> 02:28.950
it's a trebuchet.

02:28.950 --> 02:30.450
It's a scale
model of a...

02:30.450 --> 02:33.500
much larger device.

02:39.540 --> 02:40.750
Just as I thought.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.870
You recall the hiker

02:42.870 --> 02:45.200
who was killed by
a blow to the head

02:45.200 --> 02:46.080
not far from Fort Covington?

02:46.080 --> 02:47.990
Yeah, I read that link
you sent me.

02:47.990 --> 02:50.660
I now believe she was struck
by a bail of marijuana

02:50.660 --> 02:54.990
launched via trebuchet
from Canada to the U.S.

02:54.990 --> 02:56.990
As far as your
missing Maria goes,

02:56.990 --> 02:59.620
I, too, would much rather
solve a case

02:59.620 --> 03:00.950
via a single quick deduction

03:00.950 --> 03:03.450
than by hundreds of hours
of hard labor.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.990
You know, when it
comes to that,

03:04.990 --> 03:07.040
I can be the most
incurably lazy devil

03:07.040 --> 03:09.160
that ever stood in shoe leather.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.580
Right. Lazy.

03:10.580 --> 03:12.450
That's you.
Okay, so I guess

03:12.450 --> 03:13.370
I'll start making calls

03:13.370 --> 03:15.410
and knocking on doors
in the morning.

03:15.410 --> 03:16.990
I'd offer to help,

03:16.990 --> 03:19.200
but, um...

03:23.410 --> 03:24.410
Detective Marcus Bell?

03:24.410 --> 03:27.950
Deputy Strider Lincoln,
U.S. Marshals Service.

03:27.950 --> 03:29.250
Strider?

03:29.250 --> 03:31.370
LikeLord of the Rings?

03:31.370 --> 03:32.870
My parents are nerds.

03:32.870 --> 03:34.500
I guess you are, too.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.990
How can I help you, Deputy?

03:37.450 --> 03:38.990
Looking for a fugitive?

03:38.990 --> 03:39.990
Looking for you,
actually.

03:39.990 --> 03:41.700
My bosses hear good
things about you.

03:41.700 --> 03:42.910
In fact, they
think you'd be

03:42.910 --> 03:44.200
an excellent candidate
for the Service.

03:44.200 --> 03:47.290
They'd like you to consider
putting in an application.

03:47.290 --> 03:48.410
You're kidding.

03:48.410 --> 03:51.200
You apply, you're looking at
150 days training at Glynco,

03:51.200 --> 03:54.990
and then a fast track into
Fugitive Apprehension.

03:55.580 --> 03:57.200
(chuckles) That's great,

03:57.200 --> 04:01.700
but to be honest, I'm not sure
where all this is coming from.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.990
Oh, I've seen your file.

04:02.990 --> 04:03.990
It's impressive.

04:03.990 --> 04:06.830
Hard to believe we're the
first ones to headhunt you.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.990
You'd like
Fugitive Apprehension.

04:08.990 --> 04:11.080
It's righteous work.

04:11.870 --> 04:13.000
I'll think about it.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.410
Do that.
Don't think too long.

04:14.410 --> 04:15.700
This isn't the
kind of offer

04:15.700 --> 04:17.910
that comes around
more than once.

04:18.620 --> 04:21.160
(cell phone ringing)

04:23.120 --> 04:24.040
Hey.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.990
Hey. I'm on a job
for a private client.

04:25.990 --> 04:28.540
He wanted me to find
a woman named Maria Rodriguez,

04:28.540 --> 04:30.160
only he didn't know
where she lived.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.370
You want me to run her name?

04:31.370 --> 04:33.990
No. I'm pretty sure
I found the place.

04:33.990 --> 04:36.450
Super let me in to look around.

04:36.450 --> 04:37.500
And?

04:37.500 --> 04:40.160
I think she's been kidnapped.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.910
♪ ♪

05:12.780 --> 05:13.900
Believe it or not,
this Maria's door

05:13.900 --> 05:15.110
was only the ninth one
I knocked on.

05:15.110 --> 05:17.280
There was no answer.
I noticed some blood

05:17.280 --> 05:19.190
on the sill.
The super let me in.

05:19.190 --> 05:21.190
Found all this,
and I called you.

05:21.990 --> 05:22.990
And you're sure this is

05:22.990 --> 05:24.990
the Maria Rodriguez
you were looking for?

05:24.990 --> 05:28.000
I took a photo of that picture,
sent it to the client.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.040
He confirmed
that's his friend.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.410
Nothing seems to be stolen?

05:32.410 --> 05:33.410
Doesn't look like it.

05:33.410 --> 05:36.200
Her purse is over there.
There's almost $200 in it

05:36.200 --> 05:37.250
and a bunch
of gift cards.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.990
I think she made these.
I don't know.

05:38.990 --> 05:40.500
Maybe that's how
she earned her living.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.580
You said you think
they took her alive.

05:43.580 --> 05:45.410
There's evidence of blood.

05:45.410 --> 05:47.910
I found footprints
by the back door,

05:47.910 --> 05:50.410
which would suggest
that she walked out

05:50.410 --> 05:52.160
under her own power.

05:52.790 --> 05:55.700
Based on these other prints,
assailant was male.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.870
Size-12 feet.

05:57.870 --> 05:59.990
He broke in, waited for her,

05:59.990 --> 06:03.370
probably grabbed her as soon
as she walked in the front door.

06:03.370 --> 06:05.870
I'm hoping she was
taken for ransom.

06:05.870 --> 06:07.990
'Cause the other reasons
a male kidnapper would take

06:07.990 --> 06:10.910
a female victim alive
aren't good.

06:13.450 --> 06:14.990
I'm sorry, but no.

06:14.990 --> 06:15.990
No one called.

06:15.990 --> 06:16.990
No one asked for ransom.

06:16.990 --> 06:19.160
And if they had,
my husband and I

06:19.160 --> 06:20.990
would have already
paid for it.

06:20.990 --> 06:22.990
Same for my brother
and his wife.

06:22.990 --> 06:25.540
And neither
of our families has much,

06:25.540 --> 06:27.250
but we would have
figured it out.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.620
SISTER:
You said that you
found her purse,

06:28.620 --> 06:30.990
but that you didn't
find her phone.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.990
Doesn't that mean
that you can

06:32.990 --> 06:33.950
ping it or whatever?

06:33.950 --> 06:35.500
We tried.
It's either been turned off

06:35.500 --> 06:38.200
or destroyed by the person
who took her.

06:39.630 --> 06:41.000
Can you think of anyone
who had a grudge

06:41.060 --> 06:42.100
against your sister?

06:42.100 --> 06:43.440
Maybe an ex-boyfriend?

06:43.440 --> 06:44.100
No.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.890
Maria broke a few
hearts in high school,

06:46.890 --> 06:48.190
but none of her exes

06:48.190 --> 06:49.310
are like that.

06:49.310 --> 06:49.940
They're good boys.

06:49.940 --> 06:51.100
We're gonna want a list,
just in case.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.020
HOLMES:
It's also possible
she was targeted

06:53.020 --> 06:54.810
because of a more recent
entanglement.

06:54.810 --> 06:56.560
A business associate,
current lover.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.890
Was she involved with anyone
or anything questionable?

06:59.890 --> 07:01.890
Truth is, we don't
know much about

07:01.890 --> 07:03.440
what Maria
is up to these days.

07:03.440 --> 07:04.900
Once she went off to college,
she didn't really

07:04.900 --> 07:07.890
associate with anyone
from the old neighborhood.

07:07.890 --> 07:09.400
Not even family.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.890
SISTER:
We only see her
a few times a year.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.190
We go out to dinner.

07:14.190 --> 07:15.900
And?

07:16.480 --> 07:18.980
Uh, past couple years,
every time that we went out,

07:18.980 --> 07:21.060
she insisted on
paying, but...

07:21.060 --> 07:23.770
thing is, she always
used gift cards.

07:23.770 --> 07:25.900
We found gift cards
in Maria's wallet.

07:25.900 --> 07:27.890
She pays for
everything with them,

07:27.890 --> 07:29.810
and she never
seems to run out.

07:29.810 --> 07:31.890
One time, I tried to
get her to tell me

07:31.890 --> 07:34.060
where she was getting them,
but she just laughed it off.

07:34.060 --> 07:37.190
I don't know-- y-you asked
if she might be doing

07:37.190 --> 07:38.650
something questionable.

07:38.650 --> 07:40.690
Could she be forging
those cards?

07:40.690 --> 07:43.190
Uh, I just need to
discuss something

07:43.190 --> 07:45.310
with my colleagues.

07:45.310 --> 07:48.020
One second.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.890
So, what didn't you want
to say to them?

07:50.890 --> 07:52.850
I think Maria might
have been up to

07:52.850 --> 07:53.890
something a little unsavory.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.770
When Watson described
the crime scene,

07:55.770 --> 07:57.600
the gift cards in Maria's purse
didn't stand out.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.890
I mean, they often go unused.
That's how the issuers

08:00.890 --> 08:01.650
make their money.

08:01.650 --> 08:03.480
Her sister said
she used them all the time.

08:03.480 --> 08:04.850
And has a seemingly
endless supply.

08:04.850 --> 08:07.770
Additionally, Maria,
she's an attractive young woman

08:07.770 --> 08:09.810
with no discernible
means of income.

08:09.810 --> 08:10.850
And you said you found

08:10.850 --> 08:11.890
a high-end
video camera

08:11.890 --> 08:13.350
and tripod in her apartment.

08:13.350 --> 08:15.020
And expensive lingerie, too.

08:15.020 --> 08:17.100
You're thinking
she's a cam girl?

08:17.100 --> 08:18.400
She dresses up,
gets online,

08:18.400 --> 08:19.890
does a little
show-and-tell for money.

08:19.890 --> 08:20.980
Cam girls often
get gift cards

08:20.980 --> 08:25.270
and other tokens of appreciation
from their fans.

08:25.650 --> 08:26.890
Her attacker could have
seen her online,

08:26.890 --> 08:28.020
then tracked her down.

08:28.020 --> 08:28.900
All right.

08:28.900 --> 08:29.890
When we're done in there,

08:29.890 --> 08:31.690
I'll get CCS to look
into the gift cards.

08:31.690 --> 08:33.520
Sometimes they're attached
to the e-mail addresses

08:33.520 --> 08:34.980
of the people
who sent them.

08:34.980 --> 08:37.690
I'll let you know
where they lead.

08:38.090 --> 08:39.630
Going out of my
mind all morning.

08:39.630 --> 08:41.299
I still can't
believe I was right

08:41.299 --> 08:42.840
about Maria being in trouble.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.460
This is my partner,
Sherlock.

08:44.460 --> 08:45.250
Pleasure.

08:45.250 --> 08:48.290
We wanted to talk to you
about some new developments.

08:48.290 --> 08:53.130
Your friend, Maria,
seems to be a fan of gift cards.

08:53.130 --> 08:55.500
In the last month alone,
she's been the recipient

08:55.500 --> 08:56.800
of almost 50 of them.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.880
As far as the police can tell,
all of them were sent by men.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.670
At first, we thought
this confirmed our theory

09:02.670 --> 09:06.250
that Maria was working
as a cam girl.

09:06.590 --> 09:09.000
You mean one of those women

09:09.000 --> 09:10.500
that let men watch them
over the Internet?

09:10.500 --> 09:12.750
(chuckling): I'm sorry,
that doesn't sound right.

09:12.750 --> 09:15.290
Because it is,
in fact, not right.

09:15.290 --> 09:17.290
Not precisely so.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.000
According to these ads
that we tracked down,

09:20.000 --> 09:24.840
Maria, aka
"Queen Mariposa"...

09:25.460 --> 09:27.290
...worked as a fin-dom.

09:27.290 --> 09:29.800
A financial dominatrix.

09:29.800 --> 09:30.920
Fin-doms cater to men

09:30.920 --> 09:35.170
who get a sexual thrill from
giving money to pretty women,

09:35.170 --> 09:37.500
usually in a scenario
that appears coercive.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.550
Now, a typical
fin-dom

09:39.550 --> 09:41.000
interacts with her clients--

09:41.000 --> 09:44.500
or "paypigs,"
as they're charmingly known--

09:44.500 --> 09:45.800
via video chat.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.800
In their sessions,
they will

09:47.800 --> 09:50.290
cajole, threaten
and humiliate a man

09:50.290 --> 09:53.670
into sending them money
and/or gifts.

09:53.670 --> 09:55.920
It's basically
consensual extortion.

09:55.920 --> 09:56.920
But you already knew that

09:56.920 --> 09:58.840
because you're one
of her clients.

09:59.420 --> 10:00.800
What if I am?

10:00.800 --> 10:01.960
The NYPD's
current thinking

10:01.960 --> 10:05.000
is that one of Maria's
paypigs kidnapped her.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.920
Maybe they got in too deep
and blamed her.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.170
Maybe they thought
they could

10:08.170 --> 10:10.090
force her to give
the money back.

10:10.090 --> 10:11.460
You're saying I'm a suspect?

10:11.460 --> 10:13.960
Well, all of Maria's
clients are suspects.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.460
But you gave
more money than most.

10:15.460 --> 10:19.290
Best we can tell, almost $20,000
over the past two years.

10:19.290 --> 10:20.420
If I had done anything to Maria,

10:20.420 --> 10:22.710
then why would I hire you
to find her?

10:22.710 --> 10:24.880
Good question.
And it's the only reason

10:24.880 --> 10:26.290
we're having
this conversation here

10:26.290 --> 10:27.460
rather than at
the precinct.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.420
Call it a courtesy
to a friend of the family.

10:33.380 --> 10:35.420
The reason why
I didn't tell you the truth

10:35.420 --> 10:37.340
is because I have
a wife and a job,

10:37.340 --> 10:39.500
and I really didn't want
this stuff to get out.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.710
Everything I said
about me and Maria is true.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.290
We're friends.
We chat all the time for free.

10:45.290 --> 10:47.380
I'm not in too deep.
Maria's good that way.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.290
She doesn't take more

10:49.290 --> 10:52.250
than she knows the clients
can afford.

10:52.250 --> 10:55.090
Maria's neighbors
heard loud noises

10:55.090 --> 10:57.340
coming from her apartment
Saturday

10:57.340 --> 10:58.290
around 10:00 p.m.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.170
We think that's when
Maria was taken.

11:00.170 --> 11:01.920
Can you account
for your whereabouts?

11:01.920 --> 11:03.920
Yes. A few of
us stayed late

11:03.920 --> 11:06.960
to get a property ready
for an open house on Sunday.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.500
You can ask your sister.
She was there.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.590
She'll tell you, we didn't
leave till after midnight.

11:11.590 --> 11:13.290
Can you think of
anything else

11:13.290 --> 11:14.290
that might be helpful?

11:14.290 --> 11:16.290
Anyone that Maria
had a problem with?

11:16.290 --> 11:18.710
Other clients
that maybe threatened her?

11:18.710 --> 11:20.340
She did mention one guy.

11:20.340 --> 11:23.380
She said that he had said

11:23.380 --> 11:27.130
some pretty terrible things
about her on a message board.

11:27.130 --> 11:28.290
What sort of things?

11:28.290 --> 11:29.290
She didn't say.

11:29.290 --> 11:31.050
She wasn't really worried
about him.

11:31.050 --> 11:34.630
He was a kid. He was clear on
the other side of the country.

11:34.630 --> 11:35.590
She mention his name?

11:35.590 --> 11:38.630
No, uh, but she did mention

11:38.630 --> 11:40.380
the name of the Web site.

11:40.380 --> 11:44.090
Uh, BlackPill4U.

11:44.290 --> 11:46.710
"Black pill"? You're certain?

11:46.710 --> 11:48.340
Yeah. You know it?

11:48.340 --> 11:50.170
Not the Web site, no.

11:50.170 --> 11:51.880
But I'm familiar with the term.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.960
Doesn't bode well
for Miss Rodriguez.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
"Marcus Bell, U.S. Marshal."

12:02.290 --> 12:04.840
It has a nice ring to it.
(laughs)

12:04.840 --> 12:06.290
Yeah, well, so does "Dr. Bell,"

12:06.290 --> 12:09.290
but I'm not about to quit my job
and go to med school.

12:09.290 --> 12:12.920
Come on. You're not the
least bit intrigued?

12:12.920 --> 12:15.000
I knew a lot of
Marshals back when

12:15.000 --> 12:16.380
I clerked for
Judge Yamamoto.

12:16.380 --> 12:19.290
They were good guys,
real pros.

12:20.050 --> 12:21.290
It'd be a big change.

12:21.290 --> 12:23.340
I'd have to go
to Georgia for training.

12:23.340 --> 12:27.380
Then, after that,
they can assign me anywhere.

12:28.460 --> 12:32.630
Well, sounds like
an adventure.

12:33.090 --> 12:36.290
Maybe an adventure
I don't wantto go on alone.

12:37.210 --> 12:40.340
Are you asking me
to move with you?

12:40.340 --> 12:41.960
What?

12:43.290 --> 12:44.380
No. I mean...

12:44.380 --> 12:46.750
I mean, you're here.

12:46.750 --> 12:48.380
We're here.

12:48.380 --> 12:51.840
I'd never ask you
to leave New York.

12:53.290 --> 12:55.590
You could try.

12:57.050 --> 12:57.920
You serious?

12:57.920 --> 13:04.090
I don't know. I guess that
depends how serious you are.

13:05.130 --> 13:07.960
It wouldn't be easy for you
to pull up stakes.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.710
Yeah, it wouldn't be
impossible, either.

13:10.710 --> 13:13.050
Like I said, I clerked
for a federal judge.

13:13.050 --> 13:14.630
I've got connections.

13:15.290 --> 13:17.460
Speaking of connections,

13:17.460 --> 13:19.300
who's yours?

13:19.300 --> 13:21.000
What do you mean?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
The Marshals I knew

13:22.000 --> 13:24.800
said it was nearly impossible
to get into the Service.

13:24.800 --> 13:28.290
They accept like one
out of 20 applications.

13:28.290 --> 13:30.290
They don't recruit.

13:30.290 --> 13:31.800
Obviously, they do.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.130
No.

13:33.130 --> 13:36.290
The kind of visit you
got this morning,

13:36.290 --> 13:37.290
somebody made that happen.

13:37.290 --> 13:42.670
What, you think I got an angel
looking over my shoulder?

13:42.670 --> 13:45.380
You must.

13:45.380 --> 13:49.630
The question is-- who?

13:58.290 --> 14:00.290
WATSON:
Art Schultz?

14:00.290 --> 14:01.670
We're consultants
with the NYPD.

14:01.670 --> 14:03.000
We'd like a word.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.290
About?

14:04.290 --> 14:05.170
BlackPill4U.

14:05.170 --> 14:06.960
The site that you operate
on the Dark Web.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.250
It's a meeting place
for the InCel community.

14:09.250 --> 14:11.300
The what community?
InCel community.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.960
Short for
"Involuntary Celibacy."

14:13.960 --> 14:15.170
No point in denying it.

14:15.170 --> 14:17.290
We know people who are good
with computers.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.290
They were able to unmask you
as the site's administrator

14:20.290 --> 14:21.840
and ping your location.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.050
It's nothing, okay?

14:23.050 --> 14:26.380
It's just a place for people
to talk about their problems.

14:26.380 --> 14:28.130
HOLMES:
Their chief problem

14:28.130 --> 14:29.290
being the wrong-headed belief

14:29.290 --> 14:30.750
that they've been forced
into celibacy

14:30.750 --> 14:32.300
by an oppressive
conspiracy

14:32.300 --> 14:34.250
of sexually unavailable women.

14:34.250 --> 14:36.290
I read the posts
on your site.

14:36.290 --> 14:37.420
Gets pretty nasty.

14:37.420 --> 14:38.460
Not surprising,
given that

14:38.460 --> 14:39.920
"taking the black pill"
is InCel slang

14:39.920 --> 14:43.290
for embracing the worst kind
of misogynistic nihilism.

14:43.290 --> 14:47.000
Here's one where a person claims
it should be legal to rape

14:47.000 --> 14:49.290
any woman who has had sex
outside of marriage.

14:49.290 --> 14:52.630
Or another one that says any
woman who has an abortion

14:52.630 --> 14:53.920
should be forced into

14:53.920 --> 14:55.500
government-controlled
sex slavery.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.670
They're joking, obviously.

14:57.670 --> 14:59.590
Then how do you explain
one of your members

14:59.590 --> 15:02.130
who went on a rampage
at their college campus,

15:02.130 --> 15:03.960
killing 12 people,
mostly women?

15:03.960 --> 15:05.170
Or the person who opened fire on

15:05.170 --> 15:06.630
a group of female engineers
in Montreal?

15:06.630 --> 15:09.000
InCel boards like yours
have been banned

15:09.000 --> 15:10.630
by every major
Internet hosting service

15:10.630 --> 15:12.710
for encouraging
violence and hate.

15:12.710 --> 15:14.590
That's why you
went underground

15:14.590 --> 15:17.550
and moved BlackPill4U
to the Dark Web.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.840
Obviously,
you didn't go dark enough.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.420
We have questions
for you.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.300
Answer them,
or we'll tell our friends

15:23.300 --> 15:25.880
at Homeland Security
all about you.

15:26.710 --> 15:28.750
Fine. I'll talk to you.

15:28.750 --> 15:31.170
Just not in here.

15:34.290 --> 15:36.050
We're looking for
a missing woman

15:36.050 --> 15:37.880
who works as a
financial dominatrix

15:37.880 --> 15:39.920
by the name of
Queen Mariposa.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.590
HOLMES: One of your
members posted

15:41.590 --> 15:42.880
that he'd given her everything.

15:42.880 --> 15:46.960
Even drained his college fund
to prove how much he loved her.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.750
Still, she rejected him,
humiliated him.

15:48.750 --> 15:50.290
And then some other
members on the site

15:50.290 --> 15:54.210
suggested that he track
Queen Mariposa down, kidnap her.

15:54.210 --> 15:55.000
A few days ago,

15:55.000 --> 15:56.290
Mariposa was
actually kidnapped.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.380
We think the person who
started that thread

15:58.380 --> 16:01.500
may be the one who did it.
We want his name.

16:02.630 --> 16:05.290
I'm sorry, but all the posters
on our site are anonymous.

16:05.290 --> 16:07.710
They don't even have user names.
Just little icons.

16:07.710 --> 16:10.290
True, but there is
a donation button on your site.

16:10.290 --> 16:12.840
So, when people give money,
they get special fonts,

16:12.840 --> 16:14.170
they get a bigger
character count,

16:14.170 --> 16:16.090
and they even get a gold star
under their icon.

16:16.090 --> 16:18.500
HOLMES:
The person we're looking for
has a little gold star,

16:18.500 --> 16:20.300
which means you have
his credit card information.

16:20.300 --> 16:24.710
Give it to us, or start packing
for Guantanamo Bay. Your choice.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.960
His name is Kyle Spikowski.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.800
He's from
Sioux City, Iowa.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.090
(phone camera clicks)

16:42.090 --> 16:43.090
That last IP address--

16:43.090 --> 16:45.050
he logged on to your site
this morning

16:45.050 --> 16:46.290
from somewhere in the city.

16:46.290 --> 16:48.290
I'll call Marcus, let
him know that we have

16:48.290 --> 16:51.000
a positive I.D.
on the kidnapper.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.170
Who are they?

16:52.170 --> 16:53.840
That's Homeland Security.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.170
ART:
But...

16:55.170 --> 16:57.300
you promised you wouldn't
tell them about me

16:57.300 --> 16:58.290
if I talked to you.

16:58.290 --> 16:59.550
Yes, but you play
den mother to a pack

16:59.550 --> 17:01.880
of would-be rapists and mass
shooters, so you can see

17:01.880 --> 17:04.420
how lying to you would be
the highlight of my day.

17:04.420 --> 17:07.089
Look on the bright side--
you don't seem to enjoy

17:07.089 --> 17:09.630
the company of women, and
that shouldn't be a problem

17:09.630 --> 17:12.300
for the next five to ten years.

17:15.710 --> 17:17.630
That the guy Joan called about?

17:17.630 --> 17:19.000
Spikowski?
Yep.

17:19.000 --> 17:19.880
What about the girl?

17:19.880 --> 17:22.339
Not with him, but
you should see this.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.670
After I issued
the Finest Message,

17:24.670 --> 17:27.550
Highway Patrol
spotted Kyle's car,

17:27.550 --> 17:30.090
pulled him off the highway
and saw that.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.290
He didn't go for it?

17:31.290 --> 17:32.670
They drew on him too fast.

17:32.670 --> 17:34.290
Pulled him out of the car,

17:34.290 --> 17:35.290
did a search.

17:35.290 --> 17:38.290
That's when they found this.

17:39.630 --> 17:41.920
Guy was ready for war.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.500
Any idea with who?

17:43.500 --> 17:45.420
According to the navigation
app on his phone,

17:45.420 --> 17:49.050
he was headed to
a women-only gym in Park Slope.

17:49.050 --> 17:51.420
They saw me there, didn't they?

17:52.460 --> 17:53.840
Who?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.380
The sluts at the gym.

17:55.380 --> 17:56.920
I went there last night
to stake it out.

17:56.920 --> 18:00.420
I didn't think anyone
noticed me, but I was wrong.

18:00.420 --> 18:02.290
They knew, right?
They knew what?

18:02.290 --> 18:05.290
(chuckling):
They were gonna get
what was coming to 'em.

18:05.290 --> 18:07.170
Of course they knew.

18:07.170 --> 18:08.250
Women always know.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.250
What about Maria Rodriguez?

18:10.250 --> 18:12.090
She get what was coming to her?

18:12.090 --> 18:14.300
What are you talking about?
How do you know Maria?

18:14.300 --> 18:17.630
Somebody beat her bloody
and kidnapped her, Kyle.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.670
Seeing how you threatened
to do exactly that

18:19.670 --> 18:23.170
on a message board,
we're thinking it was you.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.210
What? No.

18:24.210 --> 18:25.750
Someone hurt Maria?

18:25.750 --> 18:27.290
Yeah, you hurt her.

18:27.290 --> 18:28.920
I would never
hurt Maria.

18:28.920 --> 18:32.210
Everything I was gonna do
at that gym, it was for her.

18:32.210 --> 18:33.170
It was in her honor.

18:33.170 --> 18:36.290
I was gonna show her
just how much I love her.

18:36.290 --> 18:37.960
Please,

18:37.960 --> 18:39.300
you gotta find her.

18:39.300 --> 18:40.840
I'll-I'll do anything.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.380
I'll confess to anything.

18:42.380 --> 18:44.840
Please just find her.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.460
Did you find her yet?

18:51.460 --> 18:52.670
Is she safe?

18:52.670 --> 18:53.630
Sorry, Kyle.

18:53.630 --> 18:55.290
There's no
sign of Maria.

18:55.290 --> 18:57.170
Well, you gotta
let me go.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.130
Let me help you
find her.

18:59.130 --> 19:00.340
I didn't hurt anyone.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.000
And no one knows Maria
better than I do.

19:03.000 --> 19:03.840
I can help you.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.290
Kyle, you were driving around

19:05.290 --> 19:08.340
with a trunk full of guns
you stole from your neighbor.

19:08.340 --> 19:09.920
You also basically
admitted you were

19:09.920 --> 19:11.300
gonna carry out
a mass shooting.

19:11.300 --> 19:14.000
You're not gonna be going
anywhere for a while.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.250
You want to help us?

19:15.250 --> 19:16.210
Answer our questions.

19:16.210 --> 19:18.050
Starting with:
Why should we believe you

19:18.050 --> 19:19.590
when you say
you didn't kidnap Maria?

19:19.590 --> 19:22.250
You posted a plan of
how to abduct her

19:22.250 --> 19:24.170
on BlackPill4U.

19:24.170 --> 19:24.880
I didn't mean it.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.550
I was just showing off
for some buddies.

19:26.550 --> 19:28.920
WATSON:
Maria was taken
from her apartment

19:28.920 --> 19:29.710
Saturday night.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.800
Where were you?
Saturday night?

19:31.800 --> 19:34.170
I was driving through Ohio.

19:34.170 --> 19:35.920
I took a toll road.

19:35.920 --> 19:36.880
Cost me $17.50.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.500
I-I tried to use
my credit card,

19:38.500 --> 19:39.750
but it wouldn't
go through,

19:39.750 --> 19:42.000
so this lady came out
of the toll booth.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.290
Told me I had to pay cash.

19:43.290 --> 19:45.380
She was a bitch.
I told her so.

19:45.380 --> 19:49.000
But I put the receipt she
gave me in my glove compartment.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.250
BELL:
We'll look for it.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.420
And if you really
did interact

19:51.420 --> 19:53.290
with that toll-booth
operator, we'll find her.

19:53.290 --> 19:56.380
Hard to imagine she would forget
a charmer such as yourself.

19:56.380 --> 19:59.710
I got here yesterday morning,
and I couldn't find Maria.

19:59.710 --> 20:02.000
I thought maybe
she was angry at me

20:02.000 --> 20:03.960
'cause I said
some dumb things to her

20:03.960 --> 20:05.050
last time we talked.

20:05.050 --> 20:08.420
So I figured I'd show her
how much she means to me

20:08.420 --> 20:10.920
and hurt the people
who hurt her.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.630
You're talking about
the women at the gym?

20:12.630 --> 20:14.300
It used to be
Maria's gym,

20:14.300 --> 20:16.170
but she had to quit
because they raised

20:16.170 --> 20:19.170
their rates too high.
It wasn't fair.

20:19.170 --> 20:21.460
If she was kidnapped
Saturday night,

20:21.460 --> 20:22.670
that means it would've happened

20:22.670 --> 20:25.290
right after she got back
from her trip.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.380
What trip?

20:26.380 --> 20:27.800
She was on a trip.

20:27.800 --> 20:31.250
Uh, Austin, San Francisco,

20:31.250 --> 20:32.090
Denver,

20:32.090 --> 20:35.050
Seattle, Chicago,
Toronto, Boston.

20:35.050 --> 20:38.290
She told you she was going
to all those cities?

20:38.290 --> 20:39.290
No.

20:39.290 --> 20:40.550
A couple years ago,

20:40.550 --> 20:41.670
I sent her an e-mail
to her phone,

20:41.670 --> 20:44.380
and put spyware on it so I'd
always know where she was.

20:44.380 --> 20:48.290
If you knew Maria was traveling,
why'd you come to New York?

20:48.290 --> 20:50.880
'Cause I knew Boston
was her last stop.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.290
She did the same
exact trip last year.

20:53.290 --> 20:55.750
The same cities
in the same order.

20:55.750 --> 20:57.050
So, when I saw she
was on the move

20:57.050 --> 21:01.670
from Boston, I got in my car
and started driving.

21:07.090 --> 21:11.800
Telling us to scoop that guy up
probably saved a lot of lives.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.170
I'll make a few calls,

21:13.170 --> 21:14.460
confirm he was
where he said he was.

21:14.460 --> 21:17.290
I'm more interested
in Maria's road trip than his.

21:17.290 --> 21:19.250
Her job is pretty
unorthodox, but...

21:19.250 --> 21:21.290
she still might go on
the occasional business trip.

21:21.290 --> 21:23.460
Perhaps she met with some
of her clients in person.

21:23.460 --> 21:25.290
Well, might explain why
she would go to all

21:25.290 --> 21:27.340
the same cities
on all the same dates

21:27.340 --> 21:28.670
two years in a row.

21:28.670 --> 21:29.300
We'll ponder that

21:29.300 --> 21:31.460
while you verify
Spikowski's alibi.

21:31.460 --> 21:33.290
Well, actually,
if you don't mind

21:33.290 --> 21:34.550
pondering on your own
for a while,

21:34.550 --> 21:37.250
I was hoping to have a word
with your partner.

21:37.250 --> 21:40.050
Yeah. I'll see you at home.

21:50.290 --> 21:52.920
I got a visit yesterday
from a U.S. Marshal.

21:52.920 --> 21:56.290
Deputy by the name
of Strider Lincoln.

21:56.290 --> 21:56.960
Strider?

21:56.960 --> 21:59.170
It's only the
second-dumbest name

21:59.170 --> 21:59.920
I've ever heard.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.290
He basically
offered me a job.

22:01.290 --> 22:02.550
Said I came
highly recommended

22:02.550 --> 22:04.750
but didn't mention who
did the recommending.

22:04.750 --> 22:07.130
I did a little digging.

22:07.130 --> 22:09.290
Guess whose name came back.

22:09.290 --> 22:10.800
Yours.

22:10.800 --> 22:13.290
(chuckles)
I don't get it, man.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.670
You trying to
get rid of me?

22:15.670 --> 22:17.380
Yeah, I am.

22:17.380 --> 22:19.290
After a fashion.

22:19.630 --> 22:22.290
You remember I fully
supported your interest

22:22.290 --> 22:24.130
in becoming a sergeant
two years ago?

22:24.130 --> 22:25.170
Hmm? Right up
until the moment

22:25.170 --> 22:26.300
that you told me
it was more about

22:26.300 --> 22:28.380
a pay increase
than about the work.

22:28.380 --> 22:29.800
Hmm?

22:29.800 --> 22:32.710
Still, I thought
a fire had been lit.

22:32.710 --> 22:34.550
I thought it was only
a matter of time

22:34.550 --> 22:37.290
before you identified
a new challenge.

22:37.750 --> 22:40.670
And then, two years later...

22:41.250 --> 22:42.290
When I was at Scotland Yard,

22:42.290 --> 22:44.250
I was only too happy
to watch the moss gather

22:44.250 --> 22:45.420
under the policemen
I worked with.

22:45.420 --> 22:47.500
Only, to me, they were just
a means of gaining access

22:47.500 --> 22:49.300
to people and places
that I otherwise couldn't.

22:49.300 --> 22:52.670
And they were just happy to stay
and take credit for my work.

22:52.670 --> 22:55.880
But it's never been like that
with us, has it?

22:55.880 --> 22:56.880
No.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.670
You're too good
a detective.

22:58.670 --> 23:00.750
So I want something
better for you.

23:00.750 --> 23:03.250
Something... something more.

23:04.290 --> 23:05.710
Why the Marshals?

23:05.710 --> 23:09.500
Well, I considered and dismissed
the DEA and ICE

23:09.500 --> 23:10.630
because their missions

23:10.630 --> 23:12.250
often don't align
with your values.

23:12.250 --> 23:14.420
The ATF, Secret Service,
they're too narrow in focus.

23:14.420 --> 23:17.130
And like many in the department,
you dislike the FBI

23:17.130 --> 23:19.130
because of their rigidity
and high-handedness,

23:19.130 --> 23:21.750
so that left
the U.S. Marshals Service,

23:21.750 --> 23:23.290
an elite agency,

23:23.290 --> 23:26.250
renowned for
their professionalism.

23:26.960 --> 23:30.380
I appreciate you looking out
for me, but...

23:30.380 --> 23:31.750
I'm happy here.

23:31.750 --> 23:33.130
And if it ain't broke...

23:33.130 --> 23:34.290
Yes, but it will break.

23:34.290 --> 23:35.710
The captain, he will retire.

23:35.710 --> 23:37.630
And then Watson and I,
we'll be forced

23:37.630 --> 23:39.840
to seek greener pastures
without our sponsor.

23:39.840 --> 23:42.670
And you'll be left working
with policemen who may view you,

23:42.670 --> 23:45.210
quite unfairly,
as a lesser satellite

23:45.210 --> 23:49.300
no longer tethered to
the luminaries you once orbited.

23:50.290 --> 23:52.460
You'll also have to deal
with a new superior

23:52.460 --> 23:54.290
who might come
with their own protégés.

23:54.290 --> 23:56.840
Your access to the best,
most challenging cases

23:56.840 --> 23:58.290
will be curtailed,

23:58.290 --> 24:00.500
perhaps eliminated.

24:01.290 --> 24:03.300
You will be diminished.

24:04.670 --> 24:07.920
Look, there are
worse fates, yes,

24:07.920 --> 24:11.290
but there are better ones.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.300
The trick is knowing
the right one when you see it.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.550
He figured out
that you're the one

24:23.550 --> 24:25.670
who recommended him
to the Marshals.

24:25.670 --> 24:27.170
He did.

24:27.170 --> 24:28.290
And?

24:28.290 --> 24:29.290
We'll see.

24:29.290 --> 24:32.840
I hate to think of him
leaving us, but I get it.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.670
Of course you do.
You change careers the way

24:34.670 --> 24:36.550
that most people change clothes.
Hey.

24:36.550 --> 24:38.290
The point being that you
have to take risks

24:38.290 --> 24:40.290
in order to be the best
version of yourself--

24:40.290 --> 24:41.340
as you obviously have.

24:41.340 --> 24:45.090
So, have you, uh, made anything
of Maria's national tour?

24:45.090 --> 24:46.880
I called Derek
to ask him if, uh,

24:46.880 --> 24:48.960
he knew if any
of Maria's fin-dom clients

24:48.960 --> 24:51.840
lived in any of the cities
that Spikowski mentioned.

24:51.840 --> 24:52.750
He said he
didn't know.

24:52.750 --> 24:54.750
But he insisted
that Maria's clients

24:54.750 --> 24:56.290
never met with her in person.

24:56.290 --> 24:57.210
So I did a search

24:57.210 --> 24:58.960
on all the cities and dates,

24:58.960 --> 25:01.880
see what I could come up with.

25:02.290 --> 25:03.460
Following her favorite band?

25:03.460 --> 25:05.050
Actually,
she was following a tour.

25:05.050 --> 25:07.290
Just not the kind
you're thinking of.

25:07.290 --> 25:08.800
That last stop is in New York.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.300
I thought we could pay them
a visit in the morning.

25:11.300 --> 25:12.670
The only question is,

25:12.670 --> 25:14.750
do we show up
in our normal clothes,

25:14.750 --> 25:16.920
or do we go in costume?

25:18.090 --> 25:21.000
(jazzy music playing)

25:29.290 --> 25:31.670
Kind of wish we weren't here
on business.

25:31.670 --> 25:34.290
This Makermagic Fest looks fun.

25:34.290 --> 25:36.960
I suppose a gathering
of tinkerers, crafters

25:36.960 --> 25:40.710
and science enthusiasts
could have some vague appeal.

25:40.710 --> 25:43.380
And while Maria might not
seem the type to attend,

25:43.380 --> 25:46.290
I agree her toys
would fit right in.

25:46.290 --> 25:47.340
Question is, did she meet

25:47.340 --> 25:49.290
someone or something
on her travels which led

25:49.290 --> 25:53.290
to her kidnapping?
Whoa. Love the visor, dude.

25:53.290 --> 25:54.840
Uh, Robot PD.

25:54.840 --> 25:56.290
No cutting the line.

25:56.290 --> 25:57.550
NYPD.

25:57.550 --> 25:58.500
Consultants,
technically.

25:58.500 --> 26:00.710
We'd like to talk
to one of the organizers.

26:00.710 --> 26:04.380
Um, I'm one of the organizers.

26:04.380 --> 26:07.250
Is there something wrong?

26:09.920 --> 26:11.460
This is Maria's
third year with us.

26:11.460 --> 26:14.670
Everyone loves her,
and her toys sell like hotcakes.

26:14.670 --> 26:16.590
I can't believe
she's been kidnapped.

26:16.590 --> 26:18.630
Can you think of anything
that was unusual

26:18.630 --> 26:19.800
about Maria this
time around?

26:19.800 --> 26:22.420
Any run-ins? Any customers
that seemed aggressive?

26:22.420 --> 26:23.630
I mean, Maria's
a pretty girl,

26:23.630 --> 26:28.290
so sure, she has to deal
with stuff like that sometimes.

26:28.290 --> 26:30.290
But it's not just the customers.

26:30.290 --> 26:31.670
What do you mean?
One of the other vendors,

26:31.670 --> 26:35.290
this guy named Roman Livingston,
he's been hanging

26:35.290 --> 26:36.750
around Maria's
booth a lot.

26:36.750 --> 26:39.290
Roman can be kind of
full of himself.

26:39.290 --> 26:41.920
Thinks he's God's gift
to the ladies.

26:41.920 --> 26:44.340
And he doesn't like
taking no for an answer.

26:44.340 --> 26:46.090
Is he here today?

26:46.090 --> 26:47.420
He was supposed to be.

26:47.420 --> 26:48.840
He's a blacksmith.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.290
He makes swords and daggers

26:51.290 --> 26:52.840
and fancy
kitchen knives.

26:52.840 --> 26:56.170
Works a forge right on-site.
Big crowd-pleaser.

26:56.170 --> 26:57.710
But, uh, he disappeared

26:57.710 --> 26:59.290
after our stop
in Boston.

26:59.290 --> 27:01.340
I didn't think much of it.
Sometimes vendors skip a city

27:01.340 --> 27:06.090
here or there, but after you
told me about Maria...

27:06.090 --> 27:06.960
I don't know.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.290
You might want to look into him.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.500
Hey. It's me.
I'm at the house you sent me to,

27:13.500 --> 27:15.090
and based on what
I'm looking at,

27:15.090 --> 27:18.050
I'm pretty sure Roman Livingston
isn't our kidnapper.

27:18.050 --> 27:22.290
Matter of fact,
I think he's another victim.

27:28.920 --> 27:30.630
That didn't take long.

27:30.630 --> 27:33.090
Small place.
Not a lot to search.

27:33.090 --> 27:34.380
WATSON:
Which is not to say

27:34.380 --> 27:35.960
we did not find
anything interesting.

27:35.960 --> 27:39.290
There are pictures of Roman
and Maria all over the place.

27:39.290 --> 27:40.290
They were a couple.

27:40.290 --> 27:41.670
We found this
under the couch.

27:41.670 --> 27:44.420
Must have gotten kicked there
when Roman got abducted.

27:44.420 --> 27:46.290
Looks like he put up
a hell of a fight.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.380
It was unlocked, so
we checked the texts.

27:48.380 --> 27:49.630
It confirms they were

27:49.630 --> 27:50.590
in a relationship.

27:50.590 --> 27:52.290
It's mostly
heart emojis,

27:52.290 --> 27:53.290
the occasional zucchini.

27:53.290 --> 27:55.290
Then a few days before
they got abducted,

27:55.290 --> 27:57.250
their texts got
more interesting.

27:57.250 --> 27:59.380
Maria:
"I'm sorry I got us into this."

27:59.380 --> 28:00.590
Roman: "It's not your fault."

28:00.590 --> 28:02.380
Maria: "I can't
do it anymore.

28:02.380 --> 28:03.340
We need to get
away from them."

28:03.340 --> 28:05.420
Any idea who she's
talking about?

28:05.420 --> 28:06.550
They never spelled it out.

28:06.550 --> 28:08.710
Could be related
to Maria's financial domination.

28:08.710 --> 28:10.170
Could be unconnected,
but it sounds like

28:10.170 --> 28:11.920
they got into business
with some pretty nasty people.

28:11.920 --> 28:15.380
Seems like their bad business
caught up with them.

28:15.380 --> 28:17.000
At least one assailant

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
abducted Maria
from her apartment,

28:19.000 --> 28:22.050
but no less than three people
took Roman.

28:22.050 --> 28:25.050
There are three different sets
of boot prints here,

28:25.050 --> 28:26.290
one set of bare feet.

28:26.290 --> 28:30.800
None of the prints
match the person who took Maria.

28:30.800 --> 28:34.090
So it seems like they
did run afoul of some sort

28:34.090 --> 28:35.050
of criminal conspiracy.

28:35.050 --> 28:36.710
Assuming the barefoot one
was Roman,

28:36.710 --> 28:40.960
they took him this way,
but there's nothing back here.

28:49.500 --> 28:50.840
Appears that
Roman's property

28:50.840 --> 28:54.590
extends further
than one might think.

29:17.670 --> 29:20.420
WATSON: Looks like some
of his equipment is missing.

29:20.420 --> 29:22.710
Maybe the kidnappers took it?

29:22.710 --> 29:25.290
Suggests the work
that they were doing here

29:25.290 --> 29:28.630
had more to do with smithing
than sexual extortion.

29:28.630 --> 29:32.460
You think Roman was being forced
to make something for someone?

29:32.460 --> 29:35.290
Him and Maria.
Her texts implied that she'd

29:35.290 --> 29:36.590
gotten them both into something.

29:36.590 --> 29:39.000
Something she didn't want
to do anymore.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.750
Some of it
delicate work.

29:40.750 --> 29:44.290
Much like the
toys Maria makes.

29:45.290 --> 29:47.290
What's all that?

29:47.340 --> 29:50.750
Metal scraps from the work
that they were doing here.

29:50.750 --> 29:51.920
It's called "flashing."

29:51.920 --> 29:53.590
It's the stray
scraps of metal

29:53.590 --> 29:54.590
that are around a metal part

29:54.590 --> 29:56.380
after it's been punched
out a machine press.

29:56.380 --> 29:58.670
The flashing
has to be stripped away

29:58.670 --> 30:00.840
so the part can be used.

30:04.290 --> 30:05.960
You think, if you can fit
all the pieces together,

30:05.960 --> 30:09.290
the space in the middle will
show us what they were making?

30:10.250 --> 30:11.290
Ah.

30:11.290 --> 30:14.130
Straight edges
likely towards the center.

30:14.130 --> 30:16.290
They're from multiple
pressings, so I'm focusing

30:16.290 --> 30:19.170
on the darker pieces.

30:19.170 --> 30:23.290
Should all be from
the same part.

30:31.290 --> 30:34.050
This is a recoil spring.

30:34.420 --> 30:38.630
And this is an extractor.

30:40.050 --> 30:41.590
So they weren't making
knickknacks

30:41.590 --> 30:43.710
to sell at their makers' events.

30:44.290 --> 30:46.300
They were making pistols.

30:50.050 --> 30:52.290
This looks like
the frame for a .45.

30:52.290 --> 30:53.290
BELL:
Full-metal,

30:53.290 --> 30:56.340
semiautomatic M1911-A1 pistol.

30:56.340 --> 30:58.550
Maria and Roman
were making ghost guns.

30:58.550 --> 31:01.290
No serial numbers,
no purchase records.

31:01.290 --> 31:02.800
Completely untraceable.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.050
And worth about a grand apiece
on the street.

31:05.050 --> 31:06.170
WATSON:
We found scraps from

31:06.170 --> 31:08.090
at least a dozen pistols
in Roman's workshop.

31:08.090 --> 31:10.670
There's no telling how many
more he and Maria made.

31:10.670 --> 31:12.340
We think they were
being forced to make them,

31:12.340 --> 31:14.710
probably by street-level dealers

31:14.710 --> 31:15.550
or black-market
wholesalers.

31:15.550 --> 31:16.800
HOLMES: When Maria and
her blacksmith swain

31:16.800 --> 31:19.170
tried to extricate themselves
from the arrangement,

31:19.170 --> 31:21.290
they were abducted,
perhaps to make them

31:21.290 --> 31:23.550
continue their work,
keep the merchandise flowing.

31:23.550 --> 31:25.460
WATSON:
The good news is,
if we find out

31:25.460 --> 31:26.590
who's been selling their guns,

31:26.590 --> 31:28.130
we can figure out
who kidnapped them.

31:28.130 --> 31:31.880
Actually, I might be able
to help with that.

31:34.590 --> 31:36.290
The ATF has been looking
for guns

31:36.290 --> 31:38.460
exactly like the ones
you're talking about.

31:38.460 --> 31:40.340
Apparently, they've
been showing up

31:40.340 --> 31:43.300
all over the Eastern Seaboard
for the last couple of years.

31:43.300 --> 31:47.170
It's almost 100 arrests here
of people who committed crimes

31:47.170 --> 31:49.670
with the kind of gun
we're talking about.

31:49.670 --> 31:51.300
Maybe we can get
someone to flip,

31:51.300 --> 31:53.300
tell us who sold them
the gun they used.

31:53.300 --> 31:55.380
Pretty sure the ATF already went
down that road.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.250
Nobody talked.
Well, we'll just have to find

31:57.250 --> 31:59.420
a point of leverage
that they missed.

32:02.380 --> 32:04.290
BELL:
Another stack
of case files

32:04.290 --> 32:06.290
from the ATF's
New York field office.

32:06.290 --> 32:09.290
Joan says she's still
tracking down more

32:09.290 --> 32:10.290
from other offices.

32:10.290 --> 32:12.340
Anything jump out at you?

32:12.340 --> 32:14.710
So far, no one
appears to be

32:14.710 --> 32:16.290
a suitable candidate
for snitching.

32:16.290 --> 32:21.050
These I rejected out of hand,
and these the ATF applied

32:21.050 --> 32:22.290
whatever possible
pressure they could

32:22.290 --> 32:23.800
to get them to cooperate,
with no success.

32:23.800 --> 32:27.630
Well, there's plenty more
where they came from.

32:29.590 --> 32:32.630
Listen, about the
U.S. Marshals...

32:32.630 --> 32:36.170
You decided not to apply
for the job.

32:36.170 --> 32:39.130
I-I appreciate
everything you said.

32:39.130 --> 32:41.500
Seriously. It's just...

32:41.500 --> 32:42.840
my mom's here.

32:42.840 --> 32:45.380
Chantal would have
to uproot her life.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.290
Not to mention the
timing's all wrong.

32:48.290 --> 32:50.090
Those are indeed factors,

32:50.090 --> 32:51.840
but the one that's most
important to you,

32:51.840 --> 32:53.840
you're keeping
to yourself, aren't you?

32:53.840 --> 32:54.710
The captain.

32:54.710 --> 32:59.420
You feel that leaving him
would be disloyal.

33:01.420 --> 33:04.880
Everything you know about
being a detective--

33:04.880 --> 33:06.880
I mean, the stuff
that really matters,

33:06.880 --> 33:08.880
the stuff that
makes you great--

33:08.880 --> 33:11.300
did you learn it yourself,
or did someone teach you?

33:11.300 --> 33:13.800
I think we know
that it's the former.

33:13.800 --> 33:17.210
Right, so imagine
it was different.

33:17.210 --> 33:19.630
Imagine someone
tapped you.

33:19.630 --> 33:21.460
Took you under
their wing,

33:21.460 --> 33:23.290
made you who you are
as a professional.

33:23.290 --> 33:25.710
You think you could just
walk away from them?

33:25.710 --> 33:28.960
The Marshals don't accept
anyone over the age of 36,

33:28.960 --> 33:31.000
so by the time
the captain's days are done,

33:31.000 --> 33:34.250
you'll likely be too old to
apply to the Marshals Service.

33:34.250 --> 33:36.250
I know what I'm passing up.

33:36.250 --> 33:38.960
And I know what I'm staying for.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.750
I'm good with it.

33:40.750 --> 33:41.880
Well, it's your decision.

33:41.880 --> 33:46.170
In the meantime,
think we've found our man.

33:51.750 --> 33:52.960
You're wasting your time.

33:52.960 --> 33:54.590
ATF already tried
to get me to rat

33:54.590 --> 33:56.710
on the person
who sold me the gun.

33:56.710 --> 33:59.300
I wouldn't talk then,
so why would I talk now?

33:59.300 --> 34:01.130
Two people's lives
are in danger now.

34:01.130 --> 34:03.920
That makes us more likely
to talk to the D.A.

34:03.920 --> 34:04.960
about a deal for you.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.290
You just have to
give us a name.

34:06.290 --> 34:08.880
Oh, that's it?
Look, you didn't
hurt anyone

34:08.880 --> 34:11.590
when you robbed that bank;
just scared a few tellers

34:11.590 --> 34:13.340
by waving a gun in their faces.

34:13.340 --> 34:14.670
We can work with that.

34:14.670 --> 34:16.550
Sorry. I'm not a snitch.

34:17.920 --> 34:20.290
A portion of the money
you stole--

34:20.290 --> 34:24.170
almost $50,000-- was never
recovered by the police.

34:24.170 --> 34:25.550
I hauled ass
from that bank,

34:25.550 --> 34:27.880
but the cops got
onto me pretty fast.

34:27.880 --> 34:30.380
I lost the 50 grand
during the pursuit.

34:30.380 --> 34:31.960
That's funny.
My friend thinks

34:31.960 --> 34:35.210
you stashed it at the
home of your mistress.

34:35.210 --> 34:36.920
What are you
talking about?

34:36.920 --> 34:38.670
I'm married
going on 20 years.

34:38.670 --> 34:40.750
I don't have a mistress.

34:40.750 --> 34:42.630
Then who's Crissy Olsen?

34:42.630 --> 34:43.750
My friend, see,

34:43.750 --> 34:46.750
he noticed that she's
visited you a lot upstate.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.960
She signs in as a "prison
outreach volunteer,"

34:48.960 --> 34:51.960
but far as we can tell,
you're the only prisoner she...

34:51.960 --> 34:52.800
reaches out to.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.670
But what really jumped
out is that the address

34:55.670 --> 34:58.290
on the license she uses to
check in with the guards

34:58.290 --> 35:01.300
is just two blocks from
the bank you robbed.

35:01.300 --> 35:05.590
Made my friend wonder if that's
where you lost the 50K.

35:06.130 --> 35:07.460
You realize that
if Crissy's house

35:07.460 --> 35:09.420
got searched
and that money turned up,

35:09.420 --> 35:12.290
she'd be charged as an accessory
after the fact.

35:12.290 --> 35:16.670
You'd also have to explain to
your wife how you know her.

35:17.290 --> 35:18.290
You can't.

35:18.290 --> 35:19.800
First, you're gonna
give me the name

35:19.800 --> 35:21.550
of the person
who sold you the gun.

35:21.550 --> 35:25.130
Second, you're gonna make sure
that 50K makes its way

35:25.130 --> 35:26.340
back to the bank.

35:26.340 --> 35:27.590
Crissy will stay out of jail,

35:27.590 --> 35:29.750
your wife will never find out
about her,

35:29.750 --> 35:31.840
and we'll get our gun dealer.

35:31.840 --> 35:34.710
It's a win-win-win.

35:36.290 --> 35:40.420
I bought the gun from a guy
named Enrique Moncada.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.670
He lives out
in Wyandanch.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.590
Enrique Moncada, this
is Suffolk County PD.

35:52.590 --> 35:53.880
We have you surrounded.

35:53.880 --> 35:54.800
Put your hands

35:54.800 --> 35:58.000
where we can see them and
get down on the ground.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.710
(gunfire)
OFFICER: Gun, gun, gun!

35:59.710 --> 36:01.880
Shots fired!

36:03.290 --> 36:05.380
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

36:05.380 --> 36:06.290
What a mess.

36:06.290 --> 36:09.210
I advised the locals to pick
Moncada up on the street,

36:09.210 --> 36:11.670
but they wanted to grab him
at his residence.

36:11.670 --> 36:12.550
Their jurisdiction.

36:12.550 --> 36:14.340
They get to
call the shots.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.050
I hung back like they asked.

36:16.050 --> 36:17.250
Then everything went to hell.

36:17.250 --> 36:19.250
It was over
by the time I got here.

36:19.250 --> 36:20.920
ESU guys say he went
for his gun.

36:20.920 --> 36:24.290
A hand-forged
.45 M1911 pistol.

36:24.290 --> 36:25.670
The locals found
a dozen more

36:25.670 --> 36:27.290
just like it
in a shed out back.

36:27.290 --> 36:29.130
So Moncada was
definitely selling

36:29.130 --> 36:31.630
the ghost guns made by
our kidnap victims.

36:31.630 --> 36:33.290
We searched the house
and the property.

36:33.290 --> 36:36.170
There's no sign of Maria
or Roman anywhere.

36:36.170 --> 36:37.670
And our best chance
at finding them

36:37.670 --> 36:40.460
just committed
suicide by cop.

36:52.050 --> 36:54.290
You were looking
at his tattoos?

36:54.290 --> 36:57.290
Enrique Moncada was
a member of Los Ladrones.

36:57.290 --> 36:59.840
It's a motorcycle gang with
a largely Latino membership.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.000
Well, makes sense
they're the ones

37:02.000 --> 37:03.340
who took Maria and Roman.

37:03.340 --> 37:04.800
Los Ladrones run a lot of guns.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.380
And some of the pistols
Moncada had on hand

37:07.380 --> 37:10.670
were brand-new, as if they
were made after the kidnapping.

37:10.670 --> 37:12.290
So we were right
about the kidnappers.

37:12.290 --> 37:14.300
They wanted Maria and Roman
to keep making guns for them.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.290
I got a look at some of
Moncada's merchandise

37:16.290 --> 37:17.340
before the local
police took it away.

37:17.340 --> 37:20.290
Some of the newer pistols
were rather shoddily made.

37:20.290 --> 37:22.290
Not Maria and Roman's
usual craftsmanship.

37:22.290 --> 37:24.500
You think someone else
was making them?

37:24.500 --> 37:25.380
Novices.

37:25.380 --> 37:27.550
More precisely, students.

37:28.050 --> 37:29.590
Then Maria and Roman
are teaching people

37:29.590 --> 37:30.750
how to make their ghost guns.

37:30.750 --> 37:33.250
I imagine Los Ladrones
are compelling them to do so.

37:33.250 --> 37:34.420
Once they've trained
their replacements,

37:34.420 --> 37:35.380
they won't need them anymore.

37:35.380 --> 37:37.250
They won't let them go.
They'll kill them.

37:37.250 --> 37:38.500
We need to find them
before that.

37:38.500 --> 37:41.090
We're working to identify
the members of the gang.

37:41.090 --> 37:42.420
Properties they own.
We'll move on them

37:42.420 --> 37:44.920
as soon as we find out where
they're holding Maria and Roman.

37:44.920 --> 37:46.420
HOLMES:
We can speed up
that process.

37:46.420 --> 37:48.210
We've already met
a member of Los Ladrones.

37:48.210 --> 37:51.460
We just have to invite them
back to the precinct.

37:55.670 --> 37:57.000
You want to see the one
on my belly, too?

37:57.500 --> 37:58.920
We're good. Thanks.

37:58.920 --> 38:01.880
Tattoos confirm
what we already suspected.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.670
You're a member of Los Ladrones.

38:03.670 --> 38:05.710
Your mustache
gave you away,

38:05.710 --> 38:07.000
in case you were wondering.

38:07.000 --> 38:07.660
I don't have a mustache.

38:08.060 --> 38:09.890
But you did, until you
shaved it off yesterday.

38:09.890 --> 38:12.650
Presumably to look the part
of the concerned brother.

38:12.650 --> 38:13.890
But your uneven tan
revealed

38:13.890 --> 38:16.150
that you recently sported
a handlebar mustache,

38:16.150 --> 38:17.890
which is popular
amongst Los Ladrones.

38:17.890 --> 38:21.060
We're guessing you're the one
who came up with the idea

38:21.060 --> 38:22.730
of your sister
and her boyfriend

38:22.730 --> 38:24.230
making guns
for your gang.

38:24.230 --> 38:25.650
When they decided
they didn't want

38:25.650 --> 38:27.890
to do it anymore,
you kidnapped 'em.

38:27.890 --> 38:29.560
I never touched Maria.

38:29.560 --> 38:30.440
No.

38:30.440 --> 38:31.650
Your boot prints are a match

38:31.650 --> 38:34.020
for a set that we found
outside Roman's home.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.480
Someone else took Maria.

38:36.890 --> 38:38.230
Are they still alive?

38:38.230 --> 38:40.890
Did I used to run
with Los Ladrones?

38:40.890 --> 38:43.150
Yeah. Used to.

38:43.690 --> 38:44.980
But I'm out of that life now.

38:44.980 --> 38:48.440
If some of those fools took
Maria and her boyfriend,

38:48.440 --> 38:49.730
I don't know anything about it.

38:49.730 --> 38:51.270
Hope you're
better at maths

38:51.270 --> 38:52.600
than you are at lying.

38:52.600 --> 38:53.810
What's that supposed to mean?

38:53.810 --> 38:55.520
BELL:
It means that if Roman
and your sister

38:55.520 --> 38:57.890
are dead, we're gonna charge you
with murder and conspiracy.

38:57.890 --> 39:00.850
You'll go to prison
for the rest of your life.

39:00.850 --> 39:01.650
If they're alive

39:01.650 --> 39:03.310
and you tell us
where to find them,

39:03.310 --> 39:04.900
you'll probably
just get 15 to 20

39:04.900 --> 39:07.940
for kidnapping and gunrunning.

39:08.940 --> 39:10.940
The choice is yours.

39:18.150 --> 39:20.100
Doctors want to keep
her for observation,

39:20.100 --> 39:22.400
but looks like she's
gonna be fine.

39:22.400 --> 39:23.650
How's Roman?

39:23.650 --> 39:25.020
He caught
a lungful of smoke

39:25.020 --> 39:26.810
from one of ESU's
flash grenades,

39:26.810 --> 39:27.890
but nothing to
worry about.

39:27.890 --> 39:29.940
Between him, her and the
brother, we might have

39:29.940 --> 39:32.560
enough to take down
this whole gang.

39:33.440 --> 39:34.600
If you thought the Marshals

39:34.600 --> 39:37.600
were interested in you
before...

39:38.400 --> 39:40.230
Sherlock told you?

39:40.230 --> 39:41.600
No.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.770
Deputy Lincoln
paid me a visit yesterday.

39:44.770 --> 39:46.980
He wanted more background
on you.

39:46.980 --> 39:50.850
Pretty standard stuff
when an agency like that

39:50.850 --> 39:52.940
sets their sights on you.

39:52.940 --> 39:54.480
When I mentioned to Sherlock

39:54.480 --> 39:56.480
that he and Joan
might also get a visit,

39:56.480 --> 39:58.600
he copped to throwing
your name in the ring.

39:58.600 --> 40:01.690
He also told me that you're
planning to turn them down.

40:01.690 --> 40:04.150
Captain...
Marcus, let me finish.

40:04.150 --> 40:07.310
I'm hoping
I can talk you out of that.

40:08.350 --> 40:09.440
Marcus,

40:09.440 --> 40:14.560
this is a great opportunity.

40:14.980 --> 40:19.060
Did Sherlock tell you why
I'm planning to turn them down?

40:19.060 --> 40:21.440
No. He didn't need to.

40:21.440 --> 40:24.230
I get how big
a decision this is,

40:24.230 --> 40:26.850
so if you decide to tell
them no, I'll understand.

40:26.850 --> 40:28.940
But if you decide to see
this thing through,

40:28.940 --> 40:30.650
I just want you to know...

40:30.650 --> 40:33.020
that...

40:35.060 --> 40:38.560
I'd be so proud of you.

40:51.480 --> 40:53.440
No. Trebuchet.

40:53.440 --> 40:55.980
T-R-E-B-U-C-H-E-T.

40:55.980 --> 40:57.770
It's a sort of catapult.

40:57.770 --> 41:00.810
I believe that drug smugglers
are operating one

41:00.810 --> 41:03.980
from the southwest end
of Chemin Beaver.

41:03.980 --> 41:05.730
(doorbell ringing)

41:05.730 --> 41:06.770
Yes, in Quebec.

41:06.770 --> 41:08.100
I'll e-mail you
the pertinent details,

41:08.100 --> 41:11.270
but the trebuchet has already
claimed one innocent life.

41:11.270 --> 41:14.890
You need to find it
before it takes another.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.890
Come in.
Thanks.

41:22.890 --> 41:24.310
I can't stay.

41:24.310 --> 41:26.730
I just wanted you to know...

41:27.230 --> 41:29.560
I put in my application
to the Marshals Service.

41:29.560 --> 41:32.690
I have to finish up my masters
in criminology first,

41:32.690 --> 41:34.350
but after that,
if all goes well,

41:34.350 --> 41:37.020
I report to training
at Glynco in six months.

41:37.020 --> 41:38.310
I know you're
gonna want time

41:38.310 --> 41:42.730
to break in a new human badge,
so I figured I'd tell you now.

41:42.730 --> 41:44.440
Six months notice.

41:44.440 --> 41:46.900
That's more than fair.

41:47.650 --> 41:48.890
(chuckles softly)

41:48.890 --> 41:50.890
Have a good night.

41:50.890 --> 41:55.150
♪ I don't need it ♪

41:55.150 --> 41:59.100
♪ It's all right,
it's all right ♪

41:59.100 --> 42:00.690
♪ It's all right now ♪

42:00.690 --> 42:03.940
♪ I'm fine
with how it all went down. ♪
