Never get nominated?

Sure, yeah.

00:52.987 --> 00:54.053

00:57.358 --> 00:58.824
Little <i>odd</i> we've never been

Little aggressive.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.064

About something.

Stuffy organization.

06:01.295 --> 06:03.128
>> a shitload of people.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.963
Sudz is a super-popular place.

06:04.965 --> 06:05.997
>> I can't believe how bright it

06:05.999 --> 06:06.798
Is in here.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.632
I don't like it.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.301
And what's with all the loud,

06:09.303 --> 06:10.802
I mean, where's the subtlety?

06:10.804 --> 06:11.803
>> all right, let's go grab a

06:11.805 --> 06:12.537
Drink.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.538
We'll suss out the competition.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.506
>> I'm gonna go find a manager,

06:14.508 --> 06:15.640
Introduce myself, give him

06:15.642 --> 06:16.842
This swag bag.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.009
>> what's in that bag?

06:18.011 --> 06:19.144
>> ah, it's just this stuff I

06:19.146 --> 06:20.545
Had our names printed on.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.646
I got a bottle opener, a

06:21.648 --> 06:23.148
Keychain, egg.

06:23.150 --> 06:23.882
>> why would you give him an

06:23.884 --> 06:24.683
Egg?

06:24.685 --> 06:25.650
>> it's like a paperweight.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.052
Trust me, deandra, people eat

06:27.054 --> 06:28.520
This shit up.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.021
Look, you gotta play the game.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.156
I know how to do it.

06:31.158 --> 06:31.890
>> right.

06:31.892 --> 06:32.691
Good luck.

06:32.693 --> 06:33.492
Let's get a drink.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.659
>> yep.

06:34.661 --> 06:35.660
>> hey, guys.

06:35.662 --> 06:36.728
How you doing?

06:36.730 --> 06:37.829
My name is greg; I'll be your

06:37.831 --> 06:39.331
Bartender tonight.

06:39.333 --> 06:40.899
You ever been to sudz before?

06:40.901 --> 06:41.900
(laughing)

06:41.902 --> 06:42.501
>> you wish.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.502
>> don't think so, pal.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.903
>> okay, well, welcome, then.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.071
For our first-timers, I like to

06:46.073 --> 06:47.506
Recommend our blended signature

06:47.508 --> 06:49.508
Cocktail, the blue hole.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.675
It's served with three straws in

06:50.677 --> 06:51.410
A fishbowl.

06:51.412 --> 06:52.744
It's pretty darn good.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.912
Some people say it's better than

06:53.914 --> 06:55.514
An orgasm. (laughs)

06:55.516 --> 06:57.182
>> not that he's ever had one.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.183
Oh!

06:58.185 --> 06:59.418
(laughing)

06:59.420 --> 07:01.353
>> okay, maxwell, remind me to

07:01.355 --> 07:02.687
Find a new best friend.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.423
>> aw! Ee-aw!

07:04.425 --> 07:05.524
(chuckles)

07:05.526 --> 07:06.691
>> ugh.

07:06.693 --> 07:07.692
>> two margaritas for table

07:07.694 --> 07:08.860
Six, greg.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.429
>> hey, amanda, what's wrong?

07:10.431 --> 07:12.030
Let me guess.

07:12.032 --> 07:12.898
Your boyfriend canceled on you

07:12.900 --> 07:13.932
Again.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.200
>> conference got extended.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.435
What can I say?

07:16.437 --> 07:17.536
He loves his work.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.904
>> well, I think he should spend

07:18.906 --> 07:20.939
A little less time on his work

07:20.941 --> 07:22.908
And a little more time on you.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.209
>> all: Aw...

07:24.211 --> 07:25.410
>> thanks. You're so sweet.

07:25.412 --> 07:26.411
>> hmm.

07:26.413 --> 07:27.712
>> what in the hell is

07:27.714 --> 07:28.914
Happening?

07:28.916 --> 07:30.215
>> I don't know.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.216
>> what are they doing?

07:31.218 --> 07:32.217
>> okay, sorry about that.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.418
So, one blue hole?

07:33.420 --> 07:34.419
>> uh, well, let's see.

07:34.421 --> 07:35.420
There's three of us, so, three

07:35.422 --> 07:36.421
Drinks.

07:36.423 --> 07:37.422
>> yeah, well, they're generally

07:37.424 --> 07:38.557
Shared, 'cause they're pretty

07:38.559 --> 07:39.724
Big.

07:39.726 --> 07:40.725
>> said three, dick bag.

07:40.727 --> 07:41.893
>> get three!

07:41.895 --> 07:43.094
>> uh-huh.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.095
>> I don't care for that guy.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.397
>> me neither.

07:45.399 --> 07:46.598
>> no.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.599
>> too soft. I want a little

07:47.601 --> 07:48.600
Edge in my bartender.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.601
You know, this is philadelphia.

07:49.603 --> 07:50.569
>> what's with the, uh...?

07:50.571 --> 07:51.436
What's with the black friend

07:51.438 --> 07:52.304
That no one is acknowledging?

07:52.306 --> 07:53.104
Is black...?

07:53.106 --> 07:54.239
I feel like it's weird if you

07:54.241 --> 07:55.240
Don't talk about that, you know?

07:55.242 --> 07:56.107
>> it's strange to have one

07:56.109 --> 07:56.908
Black friend and not be

07:56.910 --> 07:57.742
Constantly talking about it.

07:57.744 --> 07:58.743
>> yeah, shine a light on it,

07:58.745 --> 07:59.578
Make sure everybody sees and

07:59.580 --> 08:00.579
Knows, like, "I have a black

08:00.581 --> 08:01.480
Friend," and that's a thing.

08:01.482 --> 08:02.481
>> 'cause it's weird that a

08:02.483 --> 08:03.415
Black person is friends with

08:03.417 --> 08:04.449
White people.

08:04.451 --> 08:05.450
>> hmm. I don't... Think it is.

08:05.452 --> 08:06.618
>> it's not that weird, but it's

08:06.620 --> 08:07.452
That... But it's a thing.

08:07.454 --> 08:08.253
>> it is, it is.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.588
>> here you guys go.

08:09.590 --> 08:10.589
>> oh.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.923
>> there we go.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.092
(all cheering)

08:14.094 --> 08:15.293
>> oh, drink up!

08:15.295 --> 08:16.595
(whooping)

08:16.597 --> 08:17.596
>> what the hell was that?

08:17.598 --> 08:18.830
>> that's a sudz alert.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.098
When we ring that bell,

08:20.100 --> 08:21.266
Everybody's got to drink, right?

08:21.268 --> 08:22.501
>> yeah.

08:22.503 --> 08:23.602
(laughs)

08:23.604 --> 08:24.803
>> I don't need a bell telling

08:24.805 --> 08:26.004
Me when to drink.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.105
I'll drink when I'm goddamn good

08:27.107 --> 08:28.273
And thirsty.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.274
>> I'm pretty sure I know when

08:29.276 --> 08:30.509
To take a drink.

08:30.511 --> 08:31.510
>> screw their stupid bell, you

08:31.512 --> 08:32.611
Know?

08:32.613 --> 08:33.612
I wish I had drank when

08:33.614 --> 08:34.613
Everybody else drank, though,

08:34.615 --> 08:35.614
'cause it seemed like fun.

08:35.616 --> 08:36.615
>> well, now I feel left out.

08:36.617 --> 08:37.616
>> can we drink now?

08:37.618 --> 08:38.617
>> let's drink now.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.618
>> together?

08:39.620 --> 08:40.619
>> 'cause I-I...

08:40.621 --> 08:41.820
>> now I'm angry.

08:41.822 --> 08:45.690
>> mmm.

08:45.692 --> 08:46.992
Mmm.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.126
>> what are you doing in my

08:48.128 --> 08:49.461
Office?

08:49.463 --> 08:50.462
>> oh.

08:50.464 --> 08:51.663
(laughs)

08:51.665 --> 08:52.998
You snuck up on me.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.299
Frank reynolds, owner of paddy's

08:54.301 --> 08:55.634
Pub.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.302
I just thought I'd come by and

08:57.304 --> 09:00.305
Say hello, pay my respects.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.140
Also, I got you a little goody

09:02.142 --> 09:03.308
Bag here.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.143
Some trinkets, knickknacks that

09:05.145 --> 09:06.378
You might enjoy.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.547
>> there's a broken egg in here.

09:08.549 --> 09:09.814
>> oh, shit.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.016
That wasn't the hardboiled one.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.350
Hey, you want me to cook that up

09:12.352 --> 09:13.652
For you?

09:13.654 --> 09:15.520
Ah.

09:15.522 --> 09:16.821
>> mmm.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.056
>> oh, man.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.324
>> ooh! Goddamn.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.492
That went down easy.

09:20.494 --> 09:21.493
I like this.

09:21.495 --> 09:22.727
>> yeah.

09:22.729 --> 09:23.995
>> guys, I'm starting to like

09:23.997 --> 09:25.196
This place.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.498
>> it's growing on me, too.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.499
I-I like the chemistry that the

09:27.501 --> 09:28.733
Staff has.

09:28.735 --> 09:29.734
Oh, did you guys see that

09:29.736 --> 09:30.735
Charged moment between greg and

09:30.737 --> 09:32.003
Amanda?

09:32.005 --> 09:33.204
>> yes.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.205
>> boy, I tell you.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.206
She's got a boyfriend, but I

09:35.208 --> 09:36.174
Think that she and greg should

09:36.176 --> 09:37.175
End up together. Ooh, ooh, ooh.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.176
>> I'd like to come back next

09:38.178 --> 09:39.177
Week to see if they do.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.178
>> yeah. Me, too.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.179
>> you know? I mean, she is

09:41.181 --> 09:42.180
Cute, she is just super cute,

09:42.182 --> 09:43.381
Right?

09:43.383 --> 09:44.683
>> she's so cute.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.517
>> she's cute. She is very cute.

09:45.519 --> 09:46.585
She's not funny, though, so...

09:46.587 --> 09:47.519
>> yeah, but, no, but she

09:47.521 --> 09:48.520
Doesn't need to be funny because

09:48.522 --> 09:49.521
She's cute, she's loveable,

09:49.523 --> 09:50.388
Everybody likes her, and then,

09:50.390 --> 09:51.356
If she can tell a joke, yeah,

09:51.358 --> 09:52.357
Hey, it's just a bonus, you

09:52.359 --> 09:53.558
Know?

09:53.560 --> 09:54.559
>> let's get out of this dump.

09:54.561 --> 09:55.393
>> oh, actually, this place is

09:55.395 --> 09:56.394
Not a dump, frank.

09:56.396 --> 09:57.362
It's pretty great.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.263
Hey, hey, greg, can you get this

09:58.265 --> 09:59.197
Man a blue hole?

09:59.199 --> 10:00.198
You got to try this thing.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.099
>> I got news for you.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.200
Our secret's out, and it stinks.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.401
This manager's been to paddy's,

10:03.403 --> 10:04.402
And he said it's nothing but a

10:04.404 --> 10:05.403
Bunch of people yelling over

10:05.405 --> 10:06.438
Each other.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.706
>> well...

10:07.708 --> 10:08.707
>> so what? That's what we do.

10:08.709 --> 10:09.708
We yell at each other, and if

10:09.710 --> 10:10.709
People want to tune in and

10:10.711 --> 10:11.710
Listen, then they're welcome to.

10:11.712 --> 10:12.944
>> yeah, but I think that's

10:12.946 --> 10:13.945
Off-putting to the customer.

10:13.947 --> 10:14.946
I mean, greg would never yell at

10:14.948 --> 10:16.214
Amanda.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.215
>> all right, I'll tell you what

10:17.217 --> 10:18.416
We got to do.

10:18.418 --> 10:19.417
We got to up our game.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.418
We should host an industry

10:20.420 --> 10:21.453
Night.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.454
Invite all the people who vote

10:22.456 --> 10:23.455
Who's in the industry to come to

10:23.457 --> 10:25.123
Our bar, and we'll show 'em what

10:25.125 --> 10:26.391
We're made of.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.425
>> yeah, but I'd like to tweak a

10:27.427 --> 10:28.393
Little bit of who we are and

10:28.395 --> 10:29.427
What we're made of, right?

10:29.429 --> 10:30.729
>> yeah.

10:30.731 --> 10:31.730
>> soften the edges a little

10:31.732 --> 10:32.931
Bit.

10:32.933 --> 10:33.932
>> all right, we'll tweak it a

10:33.934 --> 10:34.899
Little bit, we'll show these

10:34.901 --> 10:36.101
Bastards who's award-worthy.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.402
>> yeah.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.603
>> yeah!

10:38.605 --> 10:41.339
>> oh-ho! Drink! Drink!

10:44.410 --> 10:45.410
>> okay, guys, if we're gonna

10:45.412 --> 10:46.411
Show these industry folks

10:46.413 --> 10:47.412
Tonight that we're likeable, we

10:47.414 --> 10:48.413
Need to have some funny banter

10:48.415 --> 10:49.414
Like greg and maxwell have.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.415
>> yeah. Don't worry.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.416
I'm gonna be zinging one-liners

10:51.418 --> 10:52.617
All night long.

10:52.619 --> 10:53.618
>> uh, actually, dee, you won't

10:53.620 --> 10:54.486
Be zinging anything around,

10:54.488 --> 10:55.487
Because men are intimidated by

10:55.489 --> 10:56.488
Funny women, all right?

10:56.490 --> 10:57.489
So, what we need you to be is

10:57.491 --> 10:58.757
Just pretty and benign.

10:58.759 --> 10:59.958
But we are gonna do a will-they-

10:59.960 --> 11:01.259
Or-won't-they thing between you

11:01.261 --> 11:02.260
And mac.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.261
>> dee and I don't want to be

11:03.263 --> 11:04.262
Together.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.296
>> no.
