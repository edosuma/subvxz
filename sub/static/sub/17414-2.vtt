WEBVTT

00:00.752 --> 00:03.419
I'm Chuck. Here are a few
things you might need to know.

00:03.487 --> 00:05.621
Did you know there is an undercover
DEA agent out in the courtyard?

00:05.689 --> 00:07.322
I knew it was you.

00:07.390 --> 00:09.258
- Your cover?
- Carina.

00:09.325 --> 00:10.559
It's beautiful.

00:10.626 --> 00:11.960
My mom's charm bracelet.

00:12.027 --> 00:13.394
We could run together.

00:13.462 --> 00:14.762
We have to go, Chuck. This is it.

00:14.830 --> 00:16.430
- Are you coming?
- I can't.

00:16.498 --> 00:18.799
Sarah, they wanted me to be a spy.

00:18.867 --> 00:21.001
Really important people told me that
they thought I could change the world.

00:21.068 --> 00:24.637
I acted impulsively, and
it won't happen again.

00:24.707 --> 00:26.443
You're a spy now, Chuck.

00:26.510 --> 00:28.811
You have to keep your
feelings to yourself.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.978 --> 01:05.444
Yeah, can I call you back?

01:05.513 --> 01:07.680
I'm just in the middle
of something at work.

01:07.748 --> 01:10.082
Yeah, me, too.

01:11.518 --> 01:13.852
I love you, too, smooshy.

01:32.002 --> 01:34.336
God, it feels like I haven't
been off duty in years.

01:34.404 --> 01:36.872
How long you in town for anyway?

01:36.939 --> 01:38.373
I plan on getting out quick.

01:38.441 --> 01:41.242
Los Angeles has all the cultural
panache of a Porta Potti.

01:41.309 --> 01:42.710
I've missed you.

01:45.714 --> 01:48.048
So, why are you still here?

01:48.116 --> 01:49.716
How long can you
possibly have to protect

01:49.784 --> 01:51.051
some doofus at a stereo store?

01:51.119 --> 01:53.153
You know, I don't really
want to talk about work.

01:53.221 --> 01:55.990
Ah, so you're sleeping with him.

01:56.057 --> 02:00.125
We have a very
professional relationship.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.560
Oh.

02:04.529 --> 02:05.462
What?

02:05.530 --> 02:06.996
Nothing.

02:07.064 --> 02:08.764
You're just really into him, that's all.

02:08.832 --> 02:10.199
Can we please not talk about Chuck?

02:10.267 --> 02:12.401
Oh, my God, Walker.

02:12.469 --> 02:13.568
What?

02:13.636 --> 02:15.403
You broke the cardinal rule of spying,

02:15.471 --> 02:17.705
didn't you?

02:22.644 --> 02:24.478
You're breaking the cardinal
rule of getting dumped.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.480
Can we please talk about
something other than Sarah?

02:26.547 --> 02:27.981
Yeah. Good, except you're moping, man.

02:28.049 --> 02:29.349
I am not moping.

02:29.417 --> 02:31.584
Hey, hey, what the
hell are we doing here?

02:31.652 --> 02:32.919
Could you at least pause the game?

02:32.987 --> 02:34.020
I know you're upset about Sarah,

02:34.088 --> 02:35.754
but there is no pause button on life.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.056
See what I'm trying to say?

02:37.124 --> 02:38.858
We are two very, very sexy bachelors

02:38.925 --> 02:40.226
with the world at our fingertips.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.395
Our lives are incredible.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.861
Yeah, incredibly average to sub-par.

02:47.929 --> 02:50.030
Look, all I'm saying is,
there's gotta be, what,

02:50.098 --> 02:52.065
two million ladies
in the City of Angels?

02:52.133 --> 02:55.635
They can't all say no to us.

03:04.144 --> 03:06.145
Target rich, Chuck!

03:06.914 --> 03:08.214
Hello.

03:09.416 --> 03:11.017
Oh, here we go. Thirsty, ladies?

03:11.085 --> 03:13.586
Cosmo, Pina colada, mai tai,
rum and coke, gin and tonic?

03:13.653 --> 03:16.253
Well-hydrated already,
well-hydrated, okay.

03:16.321 --> 03:19.054
Buddy, I... I don't, I don't
really know if I'm ready for this.

03:19.121 --> 03:20.555
Look, dude, no one's
asking you to fall in love.

03:20.623 --> 03:21.890
Okay, we're just here
to have you, you know,

03:21.958 --> 03:23.125
forget about Sarah for a little while.

03:23.192 --> 03:24.426
That's all.

03:24.494 --> 03:25.560
Oh, my God, it's Sarah!

03:25.628 --> 03:27.095
What?!

03:27.163 --> 03:28.430
Wh... what do you mean, Sarah? My Sarah?

03:28.497 --> 03:29.997
Technically, she's single
if you think about it,

03:30.065 --> 03:32.265
you know, so, yes, your Sarah.

03:34.568 --> 03:35.667
And she's with Carina.

03:38.070 --> 03:39.971
You think she'd remember me?

03:40.039 --> 03:41.406
We did only go on that
one date, and very tall

03:41.473 --> 03:42.440
women have very short memories.

03:42.508 --> 03:43.608
You know what, okay, I'm gonna

03:43.675 --> 03:45.977
go and do a little spy work, buddy.

03:46.045 --> 03:48.912
- Yeah, yeah.
- So, you go and get some drinks,

03:48.980 --> 03:52.213
and I'll kind of suss out
the situation with Carina.

03:52.882 --> 03:53.815
Hey!

03:53.882 --> 03:57.085
Hi, hi, Carina, long time.

03:57.152 --> 03:58.486
Wow, what a nice surprise.

03:58.554 --> 04:00.254
And Sarah, good to see you tonight.

04:00.321 --> 04:01.588
Sorry.

04:01.656 --> 04:02.689
Chuck, what are you doing here?

04:02.757 --> 04:03.757
Are you spying on me?

04:03.824 --> 04:04.924
I don't, uh, no.

04:04.992 --> 04:06.526
I'm just out here for
an innocent evening

04:06.594 --> 04:07.694
with an old friend.

04:10.497 --> 04:11.497
Yeah, we're just out here

04:11.564 --> 04:14.098
soaking in the sights and sounds

04:14.166 --> 04:15.633
and whatever the evening may bring.

04:15.701 --> 04:17.101
- Great.
- Great.

04:17.168 --> 04:17.935
- Good.
- Hey!

04:18.002 --> 04:19.803
Hey, baby.

04:23.974 --> 04:26.642
I'm so glad you're both here.

04:26.710 --> 04:29.044
This way, I can tell you our
great news at the same time.

04:29.111 --> 04:31.679
This is my fiance, Karl.

04:31.747 --> 04:33.213
Wow.

04:33.281 --> 04:34.314
Sarah Walker, my best friend.

04:34.382 --> 04:36.316
- And Chuck, her boyfriend.
- Chuck.

04:38.886 --> 04:40.820
That's right, Chuck the
boyfriend, that's me.

04:40.888 --> 04:42.355
Glad to meet you guys, it really is.

04:42.422 --> 04:43.522
Yeah, yeah. You, too!

04:43.590 --> 04:44.890
Nice to meet you. Yeah, that's crazy.

04:44.957 --> 04:46.524
It's so nice to finally put a face

04:46.592 --> 04:49.659
to all the amazing stories
that we've heard for so long.

04:49.727 --> 04:51.227
- Right, so long.
- Or short.

04:51.294 --> 04:52.494
Depending on the length
of your courtship.

04:52.562 --> 04:53.962
It is really great to meet you.

04:54.030 --> 04:56.197
I mean, you're exactly
how Carina described you.

04:56.265 --> 04:57.531
To the tee.

04:57.599 --> 05:00.434
Thank you. Love really
has made me a better man.

05:00.502 --> 05:02.169
What about you, Chuck?

05:03.171 --> 05:04.371
What about me? Oh, love!

05:04.439 --> 05:07.040
Yeah, love, love is a
powerful tonic, is it not?

05:07.107 --> 05:08.074
- Oh...
- I love you,

05:08.142 --> 05:10.576
- smooshy.
- I love you, smoosh.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.578
I'm really sorry to
cut this short, guys,

05:12.645 --> 05:14.980
but I've booked a
romantic dinner for two.

05:15.047 --> 05:17.182
Go, do it, yeah.

05:17.249 --> 05:18.483
So, I'll meet you at the valet?

05:18.551 --> 05:19.650
Okay. I'll miss you, smoosh.

05:19.718 --> 05:21.151
Miss you more, smooshy.

05:23.588 --> 05:24.655
Okay, guys.

05:24.722 --> 05:26.056
- Really good seeing you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

05:26.123 --> 05:28.691
Yeah, for sure.

05:28.759 --> 05:32.927
Congratulations, you
guys seem really in love.

05:39.834 --> 05:41.234
Oh, Sarah, Carina,

05:41.302 --> 05:42.735
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

05:42.803 --> 05:44.536
Karl is not who you think he
is. He's a bad man, he's a...

05:44.604 --> 05:45.437
He's an arms dealer.

05:45.505 --> 05:48.772
Yeah, my mark.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.173
What, you think I'm an idiot?

05:50.241 --> 05:52.174
It's the cardinal rule:

05:52.242 --> 05:53.542
spies don't fall in love.

05:55.577 --> 05:57.311
Welcome to your new mission.

06:04.154 --> 06:14.057
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny - corrected by chamallow35</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

06:47.074 --> 06:48.074
Look who's back.

06:48.142 --> 06:50.075
Only thing that changes are the clothes.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.576
Everything's about to change, people!

06:51.644 --> 06:55.279
Bet you're wondering why
I'm wearing my Sunday finery.

06:55.347 --> 06:59.149
Because I am here to
do my finest every day.

06:59.217 --> 07:00.918
Question is...

07:00.986 --> 07:01.986
Are you?

07:04.323 --> 07:05.823
Oh, that's not a rhetorical question.

07:05.891 --> 07:07.058
Yes, the answer is yes.

07:09.962 --> 07:11.929
Ham.

07:11.996 --> 07:13.430
With Emmett gone, Buy More has given me

07:13.498 --> 07:15.265
a second chance to manage here.

07:15.332 --> 07:18.200
I do not take that
responsibility lightly.

07:18.268 --> 07:20.501
I've learned much from my business class

07:20.569 --> 07:22.403
at El Segundo School of Finance.

07:22.471 --> 07:24.739
I intend to apply that knowledge here.

07:24.806 --> 07:29.310
Did you know that the
Japanese have no word for "no"?

07:29.378 --> 07:33.447
730 ways to say "yes,"
but no word for "no."

07:33.515 --> 07:36.651
When we are selling,
we no longer understand

07:36.718 --> 07:39.253
the meaning of the word "no."

07:39.321 --> 07:41.456
No, Morgan.

07:41.523 --> 07:43.357
I do not have any more intel

07:43.425 --> 07:45.225
on the guy Carina left the club with.

07:45.293 --> 07:47.660
Okay, but I still have
a shot here, right?

07:47.728 --> 07:50.496
I mean, she can't have
real feelings for this guy?

07:50.563 --> 07:52.765
That's a pretty safe assumption.

07:52.832 --> 07:56.501
Who is this, uh, alleged
female you reference?

07:56.569 --> 07:58.269
Just some girl.

07:58.337 --> 08:00.104
Carina's not just some girl, okay?

08:00.172 --> 08:01.739
She's basically a Swedish super-model.

08:01.807 --> 08:03.941
The country's greatest
export since Bjorn Borg.

08:04.042 --> 08:06.410
Well, people mistake
me for him all the time.

08:06.477 --> 08:08.478
We dated a couple years ago, hooked up.

08:08.545 --> 08:09.579
Now she's gone,

08:09.646 --> 08:10.880
we drifted apart.

08:10.947 --> 08:12.114
Eh, but she's back in town,

08:12.182 --> 08:13.415
I'm thinking about hitting that a.

08:13.483 --> 08:14.850
Okay.

08:14.917 --> 08:16.851
There's no way that a girl
like you could ever get a woman

08:16.919 --> 08:18.786
like you're describing here, it seems...

08:26.361 --> 08:30.195
Funny though, 'cause
if she wasn't into me,

08:30.263 --> 08:31.530
then what is she doing here?

08:42.409 --> 08:44.010
Hello, ma'am, can I
help you with a computer

08:44.078 --> 08:45.378
or computer-related software?

08:45.446 --> 08:46.712
What are you doing here?

08:46.780 --> 08:49.448
You're needed downstairs, Agent Romeo.

08:51.284 --> 08:52.684
Wow, she seems really into you.

08:54.387 --> 08:56.120
Agent Miller has been working undercover

08:56.188 --> 08:58.522
for the CIA, playing the
girlfriend of suspected

08:58.590 --> 09:00.457
arms smuggler, Karl Stromberg.

09:00.525 --> 09:02.325
We've learned ten million
dollars was recently wired

09:02.393 --> 09:03.660
into Stromberg's account.

09:03.727 --> 09:05.661
We don't know what this weapon is,

09:05.729 --> 09:07.563
but someone's willing to
pay a lot of money for it.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.732
Well, we gotta get it before
it falls into enemy hands.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.199
Thanks for being on
the case, Nancy Drew.

09:11.267 --> 09:13.768
My engagement party is
today at Karl's house.

09:13.836 --> 09:15.169
Sarah and Chuck will
enter as my best friend

09:15.237 --> 09:16.704
and her loving boyfriend,

09:16.772 --> 09:18.439
the cover that they
established at the club.

09:18.507 --> 09:20.708
Mr. Bartowski, that a problem?

09:20.776 --> 09:21.709
I'm cool.

09:21.776 --> 09:23.343
No problemo. And Casey

09:23.411 --> 09:24.677
will pose as my father.

09:26.445 --> 09:28.677
Check your math, sister,
I'll play your brother.

09:28.745 --> 09:30.912
That's a bit of a stretch, Colonel.

09:30.980 --> 09:32.347
Yeah, Casey, uh, I
think you have dungarees

09:32.414 --> 09:33.981
that are older than Carina.

09:34.049 --> 09:35.115
Colonel, you will assume the identity

09:35.183 --> 09:36.717
of Agent Miller's uncle.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.886
Carina's father's much younger brother.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.287
Karl's storing the weapon in a gold case

09:41.355 --> 09:43.422
inside a vault room
adjacent to his bedroom.

09:43.490 --> 09:44.890
During Karl's toast,

09:44.958 --> 09:47.258
Sarah and Chuck will slip
out, break in and apprehend it.

09:47.325 --> 09:49.826
He keeps the access key to
the secured area in his pants,

09:49.894 --> 09:51.594
which I can easily access.

09:51.662 --> 09:52.862
Oh, I'll bet you can.

09:52.929 --> 09:55.197
Karl also just installed
a state-of-the-art

09:55.265 --> 09:57.099
security system in the vault room.

09:57.167 --> 09:59.868
So, I hope the two of you can
handle anything you find there.

09:59.936 --> 10:02.437
Uh, "any" is kind of a broad word.

10:02.505 --> 10:03.738
Chuck is just being modest.

10:03.806 --> 10:05.340
His recent training has equipped him

10:05.408 --> 10:07.408
to handle any security obstacle.

10:07.476 --> 10:08.709
There won't be a problem.

10:08.777 --> 10:09.810
Better not be.

10:09.878 --> 10:12.078
This whole mission rides on you, Chuck.

10:12.146 --> 10:13.713
What a surprise.

10:13.781 --> 10:17.251
Carina is almost six feet of pure Swede.

10:17.318 --> 10:20.120
That's just over 182 centimeters
of Lapland, know what I mean?

10:20.188 --> 10:22.088
Stop it, Grimes, this is pathetic.

10:22.156 --> 10:23.456
As if a hot piece of tuchus like that

10:23.524 --> 10:25.890
would get anywhere near
dirty treife like you.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.623
I could totally nail
that if I wanted it.

10:27.691 --> 10:29.191
If you're such a stallion, prove it.

10:29.259 --> 10:30.426
Ask her out.

10:32.629 --> 10:34.963
Now, listen, I know she's
kind of seeing someone, and...

10:35.031 --> 10:38.466
Mm, I didn't see a ring
on her perfect finger.

10:38.534 --> 10:41.335
Well, I'm slow-playing it.

10:41.403 --> 10:43.236
You snooze, you lose boobs.

10:43.304 --> 10:44.404
We checked out

10:44.471 --> 10:46.338
Chuck's calendar software,

10:46.406 --> 10:48.373
and we noticed that Ellie
and her pin-up husband

10:48.441 --> 10:49.841
are away at some doctor
thing for a few days.

10:49.909 --> 10:52.710
So, it's the perfect
time for us to throw you

10:52.778 --> 10:55.145
- a housewarming party.
- Nah, I don't know...

10:55.213 --> 10:57.147
I'll even prepare my special punch.

10:57.214 --> 10:58.648
You'll have home field advantage.

10:58.716 --> 11:01.751
Are you ready to say yes, lover boy?

11:04.354 --> 11:06.254
Yes. Yes!

11:06.322 --> 11:07.589
Of course, yes! Yes!

11:07.656 --> 11:08.723
Carina will be there, too, by the way.

11:08.791 --> 11:10.124
Party is on, nerds!

11:10.192 --> 11:11.259
Party is on! Yeah!

11:11.326 --> 11:12.960
Party! Party!

11:13.028 --> 11:14.161
Party!

11:15.697 --> 11:18.598
All right, all right. Let's
take a look here, buddy.

11:18.665 --> 11:20.633
Uh... Look at me.

11:20.700 --> 11:22.234
Hmm...

11:22.302 --> 11:23.301
Neither.

11:23.369 --> 11:25.970
Um, why are you so dressed up? A date?

11:26.037 --> 11:27.171
Are you getting back
together with Sarah?

11:27.238 --> 11:29.006
It's not a date and no.

11:29.073 --> 11:31.107
Oh, well, who is this not-date with?

11:34.144 --> 11:35.912
Huh.

11:35.979 --> 11:37.780
You should answer that, maybe.

11:37.848 --> 11:39.181
Yeah, thanks.

11:39.249 --> 11:40.816
Hi.

11:40.884 --> 11:43.052
Yeah. Almost out the door.

12:09.443 --> 12:12.445
Hmm.

12:12.513 --> 12:15.181
Here. This charm bracelet looks like

12:15.248 --> 12:16.815
what some sucker in love might wear.

12:16.883 --> 12:18.083
Hmm? Uh...

12:18.151 --> 12:21.019
No, it's not really my thing.

12:23.756 --> 12:25.090
You want to talk about
what happened with him?

12:30.229 --> 12:31.896
When we wrap this mission,

12:31.964 --> 12:33.698
maybe you should come with
me on my next assignment.

12:33.766 --> 12:36.334
I know it's not Burbank, but, uh...

12:36.402 --> 12:38.669
We can make the best of Saint-Tropez.

12:38.737 --> 12:40.738
Right?

12:44.009 --> 12:46.243
Do you ever wonder
about a different life?

12:46.311 --> 12:47.444
You mean, like...

12:47.512 --> 12:48.879
if all this was real?

12:50.348 --> 12:53.483
If we were really getting
ready for my engagement party?

12:53.551 --> 12:55.485
Yeah.

12:55.553 --> 12:58.522
No.

13:01.259 --> 13:02.592
Yeah. We're, uh, we're talking a little.

13:02.693 --> 13:04.160
Oh, good for you.

13:04.228 --> 13:06.395
That's good. I'm glad to hear
it. Is Cara going to be there?

13:06.463 --> 13:07.730
Have you seen my keys?

13:07.798 --> 13:08.898
'Cause I could come with. You know, uh,

13:08.966 --> 13:10.533
maybe just run a comb through my beard.

13:10.600 --> 13:11.767
Takes two seconds.

13:11.835 --> 13:13.235
Uh, actually, it's not
that kind of a party.

13:13.303 --> 13:14.537
Don't worry about it.

13:14.604 --> 13:18.540
Do me a favor, though.
Could you get this to her?

13:18.608 --> 13:20.042
Our invitation to our party.

13:20.110 --> 13:22.377
Please?

13:23.646 --> 13:25.882
Fine. I will give Carina your flyer

13:25.950 --> 13:27.119
if you find my keys.

13:27.186 --> 13:29.688
Right. Keys.

13:29.756 --> 13:31.256
I should have known.

13:31.324 --> 13:33.291
Mm-hmm-hmm.
Have fun.

13:37.463 --> 13:38.764
Congratulations.

13:38.831 --> 13:41.399
You two are going to have
the most amazing life.

13:41.467 --> 13:42.701
You are a very lucky man, Karl.

13:42.768 --> 13:44.401
Thanks, Chuck. I'm
sure you're going to be

13:44.469 --> 13:45.970
next at the altar.

13:47.140 --> 13:48.106
I'd be the happiest guy in the world.

13:48.174 --> 13:49.374
He really would be.

13:53.112 --> 13:54.979
Oh, sweetheart, I want to introduce you

13:55.047 --> 13:56.180
to my uncle Johnny.

13:56.248 --> 13:58.349
- Daddy's brother.
- Kid brother.

13:58.416 --> 13:59.516
Good to see you.

13:59.584 --> 14:01.185
It is great to finally meet

14:01.252 --> 14:02.786
one of Carina's family.

14:02.887 --> 14:06.256
I'm not too sure about
the... resemblance, though.

14:06.324 --> 14:07.658
Oh, um...

14:07.725 --> 14:08.992
Daddy and Uncle Johnny share

14:09.060 --> 14:10.627
the same thick neck and square head.

14:13.130 --> 14:15.264
Ooh, bacon lamb chops,
12:00. There we go.

14:15.332 --> 14:17.365
Thanks.

14:17.433 --> 14:19.967
Master bedroom access
point is at your 6:00.

14:20.035 --> 14:22.370
We'll move when the room
is distracted by the toasts.

14:22.437 --> 14:23.804
Sarah, listen.

14:23.872 --> 14:25.942
I feel like there's
been this.. this thing...

14:26.010 --> 14:27.277
hanging over us.

14:27.345 --> 14:29.045
You know, ever since Prague, and I mean,

14:29.113 --> 14:30.046
I miss you.

14:31.215 --> 14:32.415
Will you excuse us for a second?

14:32.483 --> 14:34.150
Sure.

14:35.152 --> 14:36.619
I miss this. I miss us.

14:36.687 --> 14:38.287
- Karl's on the move.
- Wait.

14:38.355 --> 14:40.890
Um, I'll be right there.

14:40.957 --> 14:42.224
Look, what I'm trying to say

14:42.292 --> 14:43.959
is that even though we're on a mission,

14:44.027 --> 14:45.094
it feels good

14:45.162 --> 14:46.095
to hang out together,

14:46.163 --> 14:47.397
to talk as friends.

14:47.464 --> 14:48.932
You know, kind of like we did before.

14:50.234 --> 14:53.203
What is he doing?

14:54.339 --> 14:55.506
Well, what do you think?

14:55.574 --> 14:57.842
It's just a cover, Chuck.

15:04.249 --> 15:07.013
What the hell are you
doing to my mission?

15:07.081 --> 15:08.815
You and Sarah are supposed
to be a happy couple.

15:08.882 --> 15:11.149
Look, ever since I got back from Prague,

15:11.217 --> 15:12.784
Sarah's been so cold.

15:12.852 --> 15:14.252
You idiot.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.254
The reason Sarah's cold
is because she loves you.

15:16.322 --> 15:21.391
Now, get your head out of
your ass and go be a spy.

15:30.526 --> 15:32.162
Sarah, hey.

15:32.229 --> 15:33.597
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.

15:33.664 --> 15:35.297
Carina said something to me, and
I know it's not the best time,

15:35.365 --> 15:36.531
but I really need to talk to you.

15:36.599 --> 15:38.465
Okay, Chuck, we need
to focus on the mission.

15:38.533 --> 15:41.601
Carina's getting the key. Come on.

15:46.539 --> 15:48.840
I'll bet you know that
toast by heart now, hmm?

15:48.908 --> 15:50.408
Yeah, pretty much, darling.

15:50.476 --> 15:52.777
You're going to do great, smoosh.

15:52.845 --> 15:55.279
Thank you, smooshy.

15:55.347 --> 15:59.049
Oh, what did a bloke like me
do to deserve someone like you?

16:01.685 --> 16:03.019
Okay. Should we do this?

16:03.086 --> 16:04.453
Yes.

16:04.521 --> 16:05.588
Let's do it.

16:08.257 --> 16:10.759
I'd like to make a toast
to my beautiful bride-to-be.

16:13.161 --> 16:14.829
Since the first time I met Carina,

16:14.896 --> 16:16.263
I knew I'd found the woman

16:16.331 --> 16:18.398
I wanted to spend the
rest of my life with.

16:18.466 --> 16:20.733
I've never met anyone more real,

16:20.801 --> 16:23.202
more honest or more good.

16:23.270 --> 16:26.471
Not never.

16:26.539 --> 16:30.942
A toast to the future Mrs. Stromberg.

16:31.010 --> 16:32.743
Hear, hear.

16:32.811 --> 16:34.345
I love you, smooshy.

16:34.412 --> 16:36.814
I love you, smoosh.

16:42.419 --> 16:45.120
Um, is that it?

16:47.657 --> 16:50.558
Um, no. Also...

16:50.625 --> 16:56.465
may... may our first
child be a masculine child.

16:56.533 --> 16:57.766
Hear, hear.

17:01.003 --> 17:02.236
Please, can we talk
for just a quick second?

17:02.304 --> 17:03.905
No time.

17:03.972 --> 17:05.271
Carina, we just got to the vault.

17:05.339 --> 17:06.940
- We need more time.
- Wait!

17:08.509 --> 17:13.244
I just know that my uncle
Johnny's dying to say something.

17:14.347 --> 17:16.948
Johnny, come on.

17:17.016 --> 17:18.316
All right.

17:21.020 --> 17:24.123
I'm, I'm not ordinarily
a man of many words.

17:24.190 --> 17:26.125
Or any words, for that matter.

17:26.193 --> 17:29.629
But in this case, I'm
willing to make an exception.

17:29.696 --> 17:33.366
I remember when I first
set eyes on sweet Carina.

17:33.433 --> 17:36.135
I was practically just a boy

17:36.203 --> 17:38.804
when my big brother brought home

17:38.872 --> 17:42.508
the most beautiful
baby girl in the world.

17:54.419 --> 17:56.287
No way.

17:56.355 --> 17:59.256
I'm so proud of the woman
that Carina has become.

17:59.324 --> 18:02.192
So beautiful, so giving.

18:02.260 --> 18:04.361
So warm and kind.

18:04.428 --> 18:07.997
Approachable. So good at conversation.

18:08.065 --> 18:11.467
And all of those qualities
are reflected in the man

18:11.535 --> 18:15.138
that she's chose to be her life partner.

18:17.041 --> 18:18.975
Sarah, there's no way. I can't
get around all these beams

18:19.043 --> 18:20.544
without setting the alarm
off. It's impossible.

18:20.611 --> 18:23.046
Okay, you can do this.
The Intersect can do this.

18:23.114 --> 18:24.981
Just focus and don't
ink of anything else.

18:25.049 --> 18:26.683
Just relax.

18:26.751 --> 18:28.618
Okay.

18:30.088 --> 18:31.922
Relax. Okay.

18:38.796 --> 18:40.064
I'm not flashing, Sarah.

18:40.132 --> 18:41.033
Maybe if we could just talk

18:41.100 --> 18:42.267
- for a second...
- Okay, Chuck.

18:42.335 --> 18:44.636
I am right here, and we can talk

18:44.704 --> 18:45.970
about whatever you want
to talk about later.

18:46.038 --> 18:48.573
We just have to get our
hands on that weapon first.

18:48.641 --> 18:50.875
We'll talk, I promise.

19:52.132 --> 19:54.634
Okay. Now we can talk.

19:55.636 --> 19:58.371
Oh, no! Damn it.

19:58.438 --> 20:00.039
And I just know that if my brother

20:00.107 --> 20:01.807
were still alive today, that...

20:02.809 --> 20:06.178
Well...

20:07.614 --> 20:09.448
He'd want to say,
"Welcome to the family."

20:11.050 --> 20:12.651
And, "Take care of our little girl."

20:12.719 --> 20:14.683
Don't worry, Uncle Johnny.

20:14.750 --> 20:16.248
Deep breaths. Let it all out.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.248
Yeah.

20:20.952 --> 20:22.252
I don't like small spaces!

20:22.320 --> 20:23.986
Just keep breathing, Chuck.

20:24.054 --> 20:24.987
You're going to be fine.

20:27.557 --> 20:31.059
Gas, gas, gas! There's gas in here!

20:31.127 --> 20:33.161
Sarah, I'll be taking
exclusively short breaths

20:33.228 --> 20:34.395
from here on out!

20:38.900 --> 20:41.002
Okay. Hold on, Chuck. I'm
going to get you out of there.

20:49.378 --> 20:51.078
Sarah!

20:51.146 --> 20:52.313
Sarah, I don't want to regret

20:52.381 --> 20:53.748
not telling you everything
I need to tell you.

20:53.815 --> 20:56.750
Look, I'm... I'm not a normal spy.

20:56.818 --> 20:58.118
You know that. I know that.

20:58.186 --> 21:01.018
I'm a... I'm a regular guy
who works at a Buy More.

21:03.919 --> 21:05.784
And the decision that
I made in Prague...

21:07.519 --> 21:08.653
I know what it looks like.

21:08.721 --> 21:10.121
I know that it looks
like I chose being a spy

21:10.189 --> 21:11.823
over being with you, but
that's not what happened.

21:14.926 --> 21:16.293
How I felt about you was real.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.094
Very, very real.

21:20.597 --> 21:22.565
And I know that you know how...

21:22.632 --> 21:24.666
how I felt about you for a long time.

21:24.734 --> 21:26.901
You know that when Carina
told me what you said...

21:29.137 --> 21:31.672
Those three words that I've
waited to hear for so long...

21:31.740 --> 21:33.907
Look, Sarah, I know...

21:33.975 --> 21:36.609
I know you were probably kind of hurt...

21:37.744 --> 21:39.211
You were probably hurt

21:39.279 --> 21:41.480
that I didn't run away
with you in Prague.

21:48.954 --> 21:51.554
A toast... to Karl and Carina.

21:51.622 --> 21:54.589
Their love is an inspiration to us all.

21:54.656 --> 21:56.357
Hear, hear.

21:57.225 --> 21:58.225
Sarah...

21:59.460 --> 22:01.394
I love you.

22:12.054 --> 22:13.889
Good job recovering the weapon.

22:14.157 --> 22:15.824
How is the asset doing?

22:15.891 --> 22:16.958
He'll live.

22:17.025 --> 22:18.259
What is this thing, General?

22:18.327 --> 22:21.195
I've never seen a weapon like it before.

22:21.263 --> 22:24.398
That information is above
your pay grade, Colonel Casey.

22:24.466 --> 22:26.734
Agent Miller will return it to Langley

22:26.802 --> 22:28.535
on her way out to her next assignment.

22:28.603 --> 22:30.304
You never saw it.

22:33.007 --> 22:35.642
They wouldn't tell me either.

22:38.446 --> 22:40.413
Hey, Walker.

22:41.382 --> 22:42.482
I'm leaving tonight

22:42.550 --> 22:43.683
for Saint-Tropez.

22:43.751 --> 22:46.053
Did you think about my offer?

22:46.121 --> 22:48.088
I'm still considering it.

22:59.967 --> 23:01.801
Agent Walker?

23:01.869 --> 23:03.336
everything okay?

23:03.404 --> 23:04.471
It's about Chuck's safety.

23:04.539 --> 23:07.440
I thought he just needed some sleep.

23:07.508 --> 23:09.442
Well, it's about me managing Chuck

23:09.509 --> 23:11.143
and keeping his emotions in check

23:11.211 --> 23:12.778
so that the Intersect can work.

23:12.846 --> 23:13.913
I'm beginning to think I'm more

23:13.980 --> 23:15.181
a part of the problem than the solution.

23:15.248 --> 23:16.782
And I think a different agent

23:16.850 --> 23:18.150
might have more success

23:18.218 --> 23:19.285
in training him.

23:19.352 --> 23:21.053
Let me be clear, Agent Walker.

23:21.121 --> 23:24.490
I don't know or want to know
what happened between you two.

23:24.557 --> 23:27.526
But this is your job, and
Chuck's safety depends on you.

23:27.594 --> 23:30.562
So get over it and teach
him how to be a real spy.

23:38.203 --> 23:40.370
Well, time to train, Chuck.

23:40.438 --> 23:42.840
Let's go.

23:45.343 --> 23:46.476
Lives are on the line.

23:46.544 --> 23:48.645
We need to get the 2.0 working right.

23:48.712 --> 23:50.947
If you want to be a real
spy, you need to act like one.

23:53.850 --> 23:55.183
I am a real spy.

23:55.251 --> 23:57.553
A real spy

23:57.621 --> 23:59.622
would have flashed on the Bo.

23:59.690 --> 24:01.190
Been able to defend himself.

24:05.827 --> 24:06.861
Come on, Chuck. The program

24:06.928 --> 24:08.529
is in the 2.0. You can do this.

24:08.596 --> 24:10.330
It doesn't work, okay? It's not working.

24:10.398 --> 24:12.032
I'm, I'm, I'm too emotional.

24:12.100 --> 24:13.868
But if we could just talk really quick.

24:13.935 --> 24:15.603
You need to learn to
ignore your emotions.

24:15.670 --> 24:16.637
Spies do not have feelings.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.072
Feelings get you killed.

24:18.140 --> 24:20.541
You need to learn to bury
them in a place deep inside.

24:23.211 --> 24:26.347
Sarah, stop.

24:27.750 --> 24:31.352
Come on, flash! Show
me your attack skills!

24:33.987 --> 24:36.722
Come on, Chuck, flash! Show me!

24:40.893 --> 24:42.560
- No.
- Why not?!

24:42.628 --> 24:45.396
Because I don't want to hurt you.

24:50.002 --> 24:52.803
Don't worry, Chuck, you can't.

25:05.913 --> 25:07.914
Yeah, I've been
tracking her all morning.

25:07.982 --> 25:09.682
She's in Burbank.

25:09.750 --> 25:12.317
Hey, buddy, seeing as how you
didn't come home last night,

25:12.385 --> 25:13.985
I'll assume everything
went great with Sarah.

25:14.053 --> 25:15.019
Nice work. Nice.

25:15.087 --> 25:16.453
Listen, I need to know

25:16.521 --> 25:18.187
if you gave the flyer to Carina, though,

25:18.255 --> 25:19.888
'cause I really need her to this party.

25:19.956 --> 25:21.356
My whole reputation is at stake here.

25:21.424 --> 25:23.124
Charles can't save you
from this lie, Morgan,

25:23.191 --> 25:24.992
not this time.

25:25.059 --> 25:28.561
A humiliation like this will
leave a deep lasting scar.

25:28.629 --> 25:29.764
I know.

25:29.832 --> 25:32.805
Hmm. Hmm.

25:39.812 --> 25:41.446
That the girl you fancy, son?

25:41.514 --> 25:43.849
"Fancy" is not a big enough word.

25:43.916 --> 25:45.918
I don't think she's gonna age to come

25:45.985 --> 25:47.419
to this party, though.

25:47.487 --> 25:51.156
And I, uh, I exaggerated
about my relationship

25:51.224 --> 25:52.224
with Carina to the guys.

25:52.292 --> 25:54.860
And truth is...

25:54.928 --> 25:57.395
I don't think she even
knows my real name.

25:57.463 --> 25:58.997
Fine fish like that don't swim

25:59.064 --> 26:00.731
in a man like yours' ocean very often.

26:00.798 --> 26:02.065
Question is, are you gonna toss

26:02.132 --> 26:03.766
your hook in the water or cut bait?

26:03.834 --> 26:08.571
Remember, 730 words in the
Japanese language for "yes."

26:08.639 --> 26:10.173
You just need her to say one.

26:10.241 --> 26:12.809
Right, right. Thank you so much.

26:12.877 --> 26:15.145
- Thank you.
- Martin...

26:15.213 --> 26:16.813
I need a favor.

26:16.881 --> 26:18.315
My laptop broke.

26:18.382 --> 26:20.250
Would you give this to Chuck?

26:26.290 --> 26:28.391
On one condition, okay?

26:28.459 --> 26:30.761
You come to my party.

26:30.828 --> 26:32.829
Fine. Whatever.

26:32.897 --> 26:35.031
Just promise you'll give it to Chuck.

26:50.514 --> 26:52.749
Smooshy...

26:52.816 --> 26:54.350
you haven't been returning my calls.

26:54.418 --> 26:56.886
I was starting to think
you've been getting cold feet.

26:59.422 --> 27:00.856
What's going on, Smoosh?

27:00.924 --> 27:06.528
Last night somebody stole
something very valuable from me.

27:06.596 --> 27:10.332
Now I'm thinking you're
not who you say you are.

27:10.400 --> 27:11.600
I'm thinking

27:11.668 --> 27:12.935
you're a spy.

27:13.002 --> 27:14.770
A spy?

27:14.837 --> 27:16.104
Well, that's ridiculous.

27:16.172 --> 27:18.140
It's me, Smoosh.

27:18.207 --> 27:20.542
I love you!

27:22.445 --> 27:25.680
I'm not like Carina,
some coldhearted spy

27:25.748 --> 27:27.048
who throws around words like "love."

27:27.116 --> 27:30.819
I'm gonna kill you, Chuck Bartowski.

27:30.886 --> 27:33.054
No, Carina, I'm gonna kill Chuck.

27:33.122 --> 27:34.655
But don't worry, Smooshy,

27:34.723 --> 27:35.923
you're next.

27:54.271 --> 27:55.371
Good news, buddy.

27:55.439 --> 27:57.406
- Your girl is here.
- She is?

27:57.474 --> 27:58.374
Mm-hmm.

27:58.441 --> 28:00.042
Of course she is.

28:00.110 --> 28:02.177
What did I tell you, huh?

28:02.245 --> 28:03.345
Right.

28:17.419 --> 28:18.819
And she showed up

28:18.887 --> 28:21.524
with four guys and no beer.

28:21.591 --> 28:22.726
Thanks a lot.

28:22.794 --> 28:24.761
Now our party's a sausage fest.

28:26.131 --> 28:29.866
Loo... ser.

28:32.036 --> 28:33.402
So, what's the news on Carina?

28:33.470 --> 28:34.604
Anything I can do to help?

28:34.671 --> 28:35.938
Every branch of U.S. intelligence

28:36.006 --> 28:37.239
is looking for her, Chuck.

28:37.307 --> 28:38.374
America's best and brightest

28:38.441 --> 28:40.710
are on the case, so
you can just sit tight.

28:45.015 --> 28:47.382
Is this the Chuck Bartowski apartment?

28:47.450 --> 28:48.951
Well, it's kind of both
of ours. I got this.

28:49.018 --> 28:50.552
This is VIP only, gentleman.

28:50.620 --> 28:52.754
Martin, where's Chuck and Sarah?

28:52.822 --> 28:54.756
Um, on the way, I guess.

28:54.824 --> 28:56.691
I see you brought some
of your... relatives?

28:56.759 --> 28:58.260
Call Chuck. Tell him I'm here.

28:58.327 --> 29:00.095
Okay. Whoa, comrade. Ow!

29:00.162 --> 29:02.431
Did I not save the odd hippie?

29:02.498 --> 29:04.432
Ha, ha! I'm gonna allow that one.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.702
Boys, easy, easy. You
don't want to get physical.

29:09.339 --> 29:10.973
Hey, buddy.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.040
Hey, where are you?

29:12.108 --> 29:13.041
Uh, I'm kind of in the middle

29:13.109 --> 29:14.042
of something right now.

29:14.110 --> 29:15.144
Yeah, just hold on a second.

29:15.212 --> 29:16.712
I need your advice about Carina.

29:16.780 --> 29:18.448
What about Carina?

29:18.515 --> 29:19.716
She's here.

29:19.783 --> 29:21.050
I took Big Mike's advice

29:21.118 --> 29:22.551
from the El Segundo School of Finance

29:22.619 --> 29:24.320
and asked her to come to the party.

29:24.388 --> 29:26.589
She said yes.

29:26.657 --> 29:28.958
So you're telling me that Carina
is at our apartment right now?

29:29.026 --> 29:31.161
Yes, but that's not the problem.

29:31.229 --> 29:33.397
She shows up with her
boyfriend and three Aqua Velvas.

29:33.465 --> 29:35.132
throwing everybody around.
You know, I can't...

29:35.200 --> 29:37.268
Can you believe it?

29:37.336 --> 29:39.270
Yeah. Yeah, I can believe it.

29:39.338 --> 29:41.473
She humiliated me in
front of my friends,

29:41.540 --> 29:43.642
and I think I gotta go tell her off.

29:43.710 --> 29:46.444
No, no, no! No, Morgan. Stay away!

29:46.512 --> 29:47.678
Why?

29:47.746 --> 29:49.513
Because it's dangerous...

29:49.581 --> 29:51.448
... really uncool.

29:51.516 --> 29:53.784
Women love mystery, buddy.
You gotta, you gotta be aloof.

29:53.852 --> 29:55.652
Promise me that you will stay away.

29:55.720 --> 30:00.790
Yeah, all right, whatever.
I'll try it your way. Thanks.

30:04.362 --> 30:06.830
Those studs inside are
gonna ruin our chances

30:06.898 --> 30:09.165
with the medium-hot chicks
from Underpants Unlimited.

30:09.233 --> 30:11.701
We don't stand a chance, Jeffrey.

30:11.769 --> 30:15.771
Been drinking this jail
juice since I was in diapers.

30:15.839 --> 30:18.174
Built up a tolerance.

30:18.241 --> 30:20.175
I'll challenge them
to a drinking contest,

30:20.243 --> 30:23.846
they'll pass out.

30:23.914 --> 30:28.650
By process of elimination,
we land the ladies.

30:28.718 --> 30:30.185
I love it!

30:32.689 --> 30:35.057
Bottoms up, fellas! Grab your own.

30:35.124 --> 30:36.058
Help yourselves.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.893
Oh, hey, Skip.

30:38.928 --> 30:39.528
Thank you.

30:40.597 --> 30:42.197
Hey, watch that guy!

30:42.265 --> 30:46.401
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, easy,
easy, gentlemen, gentle-men.

30:46.469 --> 30:47.636
It's okay, easy!

30:47.704 --> 30:49.571
He's just hammered.

30:49.639 --> 30:50.672
Get him out!

30:50.740 --> 30:52.074
Easy, gentle giants.

30:52.141 --> 30:54.843
I plan on joining him at
the bottom of this glass.

30:54.911 --> 30:56.177
Gentlemen, lift up your skirts

30:56.245 --> 30:57.645
and start your engines.

30:57.713 --> 30:59.547
Well put, Jeffrey.

31:06.822 --> 31:08.122
You know what?

31:11.927 --> 31:14.563
Jefferson, no need to waste these.

31:14.630 --> 31:16.497
To you, my friend.

31:22.203 --> 31:23.403
Mom used to...

31:27.675 --> 31:29.842
Guy's got no tolerance.

31:40.254 --> 31:44.690
It's nice to see you think so
much of the ring I bought you.

31:44.757 --> 31:47.192
You try anything like that again,

31:47.260 --> 31:50.296
and I'll kill you right here, Smooshy.

32:01.709 --> 32:03.176
Whoa!
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

32:03.244 --> 32:04.511
Hey, stop-stop-stop!
What are you thinking?

32:04.578 --> 32:05.912
You can't just go out there blasting.

32:05.980 --> 32:07.914
All of my friends are out here!
Half the mall is out there!

32:07.981 --> 32:09.917
Got a better plan, Bartowski?

32:09.985 --> 32:11.922
As a matter of fact, I
do. Carina is still alive,

32:11.989 --> 32:14.123
which means she hasn't
given Karl the case yet,

32:14.191 --> 32:16.426
which means we have something
to negotiate with peacefully.

32:16.493 --> 32:18.828
Chuck's right. The question
is, where's the weapon?

32:18.896 --> 32:21.564
Unbelievable. Cuddling
with my girl in my house!

32:23.601 --> 32:25.469
All right. That's it.

32:27.005 --> 32:29.839
Bearded bogey incoming.

32:31.541 --> 32:32.540
Martin.

32:34.043 --> 32:35.042
Did you speak to Chuck?

32:39.113 --> 32:41.014
First things first.

32:41.081 --> 32:42.315
My name is not Martin.

32:42.382 --> 32:43.482
It's Morgan.

32:43.550 --> 32:46.018
Morgan Guillermo Grimes. Memorize it.

32:46.086 --> 32:47.620
Okay, number two.

32:47.687 --> 32:49.121
Just because you're a
beautiful woman that I'd give

32:49.189 --> 32:51.523
a non-vital organ to make love
to, doesn't give you the right

32:51.591 --> 32:52.557
to just show up here with this clown...

32:52.625 --> 32:53.558
Wait a minute... and humiliate me

32:53.626 --> 32:54.526
in front of my friends.

32:55.428 --> 32:56.361
Who is this Todger?

32:56.429 --> 32:57.595
You got to be kidding me.

32:57.663 --> 32:59.130
Seriously, do me a favor. Take a hike.

32:59.198 --> 33:01.132
And take the slabs of beef with you.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.968
You don't have time to deal
with a dead body, sweetheart.

33:04.036 --> 33:06.170
Okay.

33:06.238 --> 33:07.238
Move out, boys.

33:07.306 --> 33:08.339
Yeah, back it up, bitches.

33:08.407 --> 33:10.241
What?!

33:10.309 --> 33:12.209
Morgan, maybe you should leave. Yeah.

33:12.277 --> 33:14.545
Uh, my house, my party.
I think you need to leave.

33:14.613 --> 33:16.514
Yeah, that's right, hottie. Bounce.

33:16.581 --> 33:17.882
All right? Fun fact for you.

33:17.949 --> 33:20.718
730 words in the Japanese
language for the word "yes."

33:20.785 --> 33:22.086
No word for no.

33:22.153 --> 33:23.653
But if there was a Japanese word for no,

33:23.721 --> 33:25.255
I'd be saying it to you right now.

33:25.323 --> 33:26.556
Instead, I'll leave you with this.

33:26.624 --> 33:28.091
Sayonara.

33:28.158 --> 33:30.426
You want Chuck to have this?

33:30.494 --> 33:32.395
No!

33:32.463 --> 33:33.596
Give it to him yourself.

33:34.999 --> 33:36.799
I'm done.

33:39.736 --> 33:43.606
Let's go. Don't let the door
hit you on the ass on the way...

33:46.675 --> 33:48.876
No one's ever said no to me before.

33:48.943 --> 33:50.911
Idiot.

33:50.978 --> 33:52.912
Now they have both
Carina and the weapon.

33:52.980 --> 33:54.213
No negotiating now.

33:54.281 --> 33:55.381
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

33:55.449 --> 33:56.582
There's still got to be something.

33:56.650 --> 33:57.850
There's got to be a contingency plan

33:57.918 --> 34:00.418
in case enemy agents
infiltrate my apartment, right?

34:00.486 --> 34:01.686
Like a button that you push that calls

34:01.754 --> 34:03.588
the cavalry, so they can swoop
in and clear everyone out?

34:03.656 --> 34:05.724
- Where's the button?
-  Me.

34:05.791 --> 34:07.225
I'm the button.

34:19.304 --> 34:20.237
Break it up.

34:20.304 --> 34:21.272
Party's over.

34:21.340 --> 34:22.672
Damn kids.

34:22.741 --> 34:24.175
Get out of here!

34:25.310 --> 34:27.244
That's it. Go on. Get out of here!

34:27.312 --> 34:28.513
You, too.

34:28.580 --> 34:29.813
Get out!

34:38.489 --> 34:40.524
Here. You're going to need a weapon.

34:40.591 --> 34:41.525
No. No guns.

34:41.592 --> 34:43.326
I hate guns... you know that.

34:45.295 --> 34:46.897
Think of it as a Bo.

34:59.343 --> 35:01.510
Sorry to disturb your sleep, sir.

35:02.546 --> 35:04.179
No problem.

35:06.816 --> 35:08.283
Drop your weapons!

35:10.653 --> 35:12.921
Put it down.

35:12.989 --> 35:14.556
I should have known

35:14.624 --> 35:16.559
by your paint
- peeling speech

35:16.626 --> 35:18.794
that Uncle Johnny was a narc, too.

35:18.862 --> 35:19.996
Drop the gun, lover boy.

35:20.063 --> 35:22.231
I'm having the worst day of my life,

35:22.299 --> 35:24.867
so I don't give a fat crap.

35:26.837 --> 35:27.837
Sarah, drop your guns.

35:27.904 --> 35:28.938
Casey, drop your guns.

35:29.006 --> 35:30.072
Huh?

35:30.140 --> 35:31.540
Trust me.

35:42.419 --> 35:44.553
Get their guns.

36:09.539 --> 36:10.839
Let her go, Karl.

36:10.906 --> 36:12.273
You shoot me, I shoot her.

36:12.341 --> 36:13.675
I don't care.

36:14.910 --> 36:16.810
Bitch has broken my heart.

36:16.878 --> 36:17.844
She dies.

36:17.912 --> 36:19.546
I get it, man. I get it, okay?

36:21.915 --> 36:23.348
You took a chance.

36:23.416 --> 36:24.616
You... you loved someone,

36:24.683 --> 36:26.283
maybe for the first time in your life.

36:26.351 --> 36:28.119
All you've ever done before is...

36:28.187 --> 36:29.721
is shut off your feelings.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.456
You... you bury them deep down inside

36:31.523 --> 36:33.624
because, in your profession...
in your line of work...

36:33.692 --> 36:36.060
it's a liability, right? It's...

36:36.127 --> 36:40.030
it can... it can
certainly be a liability.

36:41.432 --> 36:43.533
And I know...

36:43.601 --> 36:45.836
I know that you think that
you messed up your life

36:45.903 --> 36:47.904
because you opened up your heart,

36:47.972 --> 36:49.273
but maybe you helped her

36:49.340 --> 36:51.909
open up her heart in the process.

36:53.345 --> 36:56.180
Maybe because you loved her...

36:58.183 --> 37:00.951
she's learned how to love, too.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.456
He's right, Karl.

37:06.524 --> 37:08.692
I did fall in love with you.

37:08.759 --> 37:11.361
Maybe at first you
were just an assignment,

37:11.429 --> 37:13.363
but not anymore.

37:16.901 --> 37:17.901
Really?

37:24.575 --> 37:26.209
Yeah, right, stupid.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.212
Spies don't fall in love.

37:58.532 --> 38:01.134
Don't touch it, Mr. Bartowski.

38:01.202 --> 38:03.736
Uh, I was just thinking
that maybe if I looked at it,

38:03.804 --> 38:04.871
I could flash.

38:04.939 --> 38:06.339
No, thank you, Chuck.

38:06.407 --> 38:08.908
All I need to know is that
it's now back in safe hands.

38:08.976 --> 38:10.143
Colonel Casey will stay with it

38:10.211 --> 38:12.112
until a team arrives to secure it.

38:12.179 --> 38:13.446
That is all.

38:18.920 --> 38:21.256
We can't keep this a secret anymore.

38:21.323 --> 38:23.224
It's too dangerous.

38:23.292 --> 38:25.026
We need to tell them.

38:25.094 --> 38:27.329
They need to be prepared.

38:27.396 --> 38:29.965
Shaw...

38:30.033 --> 38:32.335
please.

38:48.785 --> 38:50.085
I'm listening,

38:50.153 --> 38:51.952
if there's something
that you want to say.

38:52.020 --> 38:54.917
I'm sure there's somewhere
else that you'd rather be.

38:54.985 --> 38:56.583
No. I'm good here.

38:56.651 --> 38:58.383
For now.

39:04.022 --> 39:06.024
You're right... I'm not a real spy.

39:06.092 --> 39:09.228
I'm... I'm emotional, and
that makes me a liability.

39:09.295 --> 39:10.495
Not always.

39:10.563 --> 39:13.298
You might not have flashed,
but you did your job.

39:13.365 --> 39:15.766
You got to Karl, and
you talked him down,

39:15.834 --> 39:17.668
and if it weren't for your emotions,

39:17.736 --> 39:19.136
he would've killed Carina.

39:22.906 --> 39:24.372
It's quite a mess we made.

39:26.075 --> 39:27.808
Yeah.

39:27.876 --> 39:30.677
I'm really hoping we
can clean it up, though.

39:30.744 --> 39:32.745
Maybe.

39:32.813 --> 39:35.048
But you're on your
own with the courtyard.

39:35.115 --> 39:37.116
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

39:40.886 --> 39:42.086
Morgan.

39:44.122 --> 39:46.190
Dude, I'm all alone,

39:46.257 --> 39:48.559
cleaning up your mess.

39:50.361 --> 39:52.963
This better have been worth it, buddy.

40:02.905 --> 40:04.172
Wow.

40:05.207 --> 40:06.607
Wow.

40:08.343 --> 40:09.576
Why did you...?

40:09.644 --> 40:10.710
Mmm.

40:10.778 --> 40:14.114
No one's ever said no to me before.

40:14.182 --> 40:15.549
It's sexy.

40:17.752 --> 40:18.985
Was I...?

40:19.053 --> 40:20.820
Or was it...?

40:20.888 --> 40:22.888
Mmm. I've had better.

40:22.956 --> 40:24.723
Yeah, of course.

40:24.791 --> 40:25.857
But not many.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.632
So...

40:35.700 --> 40:37.968
Saint-Tropez doesn't
sound appealing to you?

40:38.035 --> 40:39.903
Oh. Incredibly.

40:39.971 --> 40:42.005
But I think I'm going to stay here.

40:42.072 --> 40:43.940
At least for now.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.377
I thought you'd say that.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.780
Here. A little going-away present.

40:51.416 --> 40:53.316
You should take a look at it.

40:54.351 --> 40:56.152
Okay.

40:56.220 --> 40:58.288
So, I guess I'll see you around, huh?

40:58.356 --> 40:59.689
Yeah.

41:15.905 --> 41:17.772
Look, Sarah, I know...

41:19.141 --> 41:20.842
I know that you're probably very hurt.

41:20.910 --> 41:22.076
You're probably hurt

41:22.144 --> 41:24.646
that I didn't run away
with you in Prague.

41:24.713 --> 41:26.914
I did that, and I'm... I'm sorry.

41:26.982 --> 41:30.986
You have to know that you were
everything that I ever wanted.

41:31.053 --> 41:33.521
But how can I do that? How
could I run away with you?

41:33.589 --> 41:34.956
How could I be with you, knowing

41:35.024 --> 41:36.591
what I'd turned my back on, you know?

41:36.658 --> 41:39.627
Knowing that what I had in my
head could help a lot of people?

41:41.830 --> 41:45.366
And you're the one
that taught me that...

41:45.433 --> 41:48.268
that being a spy is about
choosing something bigger.

41:48.336 --> 41:51.338
It's... it's about putting
aside your own personal feelings

41:51.406 --> 41:53.774
for the greater good,
and that's what I choose.

41:53.841 --> 41:57.444
I chose to be a spy for my
friends and my family and you.

41:58.479 --> 42:01.882
I chose to be a spy because...

42:02.917 --> 42:04.751
Sarah, I love you.
