WEBVTT

00:10.260 --> 00:13.530
Their souls can't leave.

00:13.630 --> 00:15.630
It's like
there's a war here.

00:17.170 --> 00:19.670
This could manipulate
living people

00:19.770 --> 00:21.100
into harming one another.

00:23.310 --> 00:25.470
Get the freak outta my head.

00:25.580 --> 00:28.240
It could kill them.

00:28.350 --> 00:31.180
Turns the ignition to the car,
and the whole car blows up.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.850
What the **** is happening?

00:33.920 --> 00:37.590
There's something very wrong
with this land.

00:37.690 --> 00:39.750
I just hear death.

00:39.860 --> 00:42.060
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.590
God.

00:43.690 --> 00:45.660
He was like,
"I'm going to get you."

00:45.760 --> 00:46.760
I see dead people.

00:46.860 --> 00:48.030
Her face was all demonic.

00:48.130 --> 00:49.830
I speak to dead people...

00:49.930 --> 00:52.570
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

00:52.670 --> 00:53.970
...and they speak to me.

00:54.070 --> 00:55.500
- What is he trying to do?
- Kill them.

00:55.610 --> 00:58.640
But there's only one way
to know if my findings are real.

00:58.740 --> 01:00.640
Something happened.
Bam, bam, bam.

01:00.740 --> 01:02.140
I rely on my partner.

01:02.250 --> 01:03.780
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.510
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:05.620 --> 01:07.020
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

01:07.120 --> 01:10.590
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.690 --> 01:12.790
- They're everywhere.
- It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.890 --> 01:15.690
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

01:15.790 --> 01:17.660
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.760 --> 01:19.730
We never communicate
during an investigation...

01:19.830 --> 01:20.930
...until the very end...

01:21.030 --> 01:22.560
Is this dead guy
doin' that to her?

01:22.630 --> 01:24.700
...when we uncover if
it's safe for you to stay...

01:24.800 --> 01:26.430
That's it.

01:26.540 --> 01:28.600
...or time to get out.

01:28.710 --> 01:32.170
Somebody is gonna die
over there soon. Yeah.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074

01:46.790 --> 01:48.190
I'm in Youngstown, Ohio.

01:48.290 --> 01:52.290
It's a struggling city about
75 miles east of Cleveland.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.160
Now, I got a call
from a woman named Lorie.

01:54.260 --> 01:56.870
Her story broke my heart.

01:56.970 --> 02:00.070
She has stage IV cancer
and she knows she's gonna die.

02:00.170 --> 02:02.440
But she believes there are
forces inside the house

02:02.540 --> 02:04.940
trying to rip her family apart.

02:05.010 --> 02:07.680
Her dying wish
is to kick those spirits out

02:07.780 --> 02:10.009
and have her family
live there in peace.

02:10.110 --> 02:12.250
I really hope we can help
this woman out.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.190
Before Amy arrives,

02:17.290 --> 02:20.390
I clear the house
of any leading information.

02:20.490 --> 02:23.460
Family photographs, mementos

02:23.560 --> 02:25.030
and even
Native American artifacts

02:25.130 --> 02:27.760
need to be covered or removed.

02:27.860 --> 02:29.030
When I'm finished,

02:29.130 --> 02:31.070
the location will be ready
for tonight's walk.

02:40.210 --> 02:44.210
So this is very strange.

02:44.310 --> 02:49.650
The thing about this land
is that the dead can't die here.

02:49.750 --> 02:51.990
Their souls can't leave.

02:52.090 --> 02:53.890
A lot of 'em are roamin' around.

02:57.690 --> 03:02.360
And they occasionally
are walking around in --

03:02.470 --> 03:03.400
in through the house.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.730
You see? They're trapped.

03:05.800 --> 03:09.040
So there's something
very wrong with this land.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.050
I know this is tough
to talk about,

03:19.150 --> 03:22.350
but you have
stage IV cancer.

03:22.450 --> 03:23.850
Yes.

03:23.950 --> 03:26.490
The chances of me
living through this...

03:28.930 --> 03:31.060
It's not gonna happen.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.600
The doctor said
2 months to live.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.900
So the time I have,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.400
I need
to make this house safe.

03:39.870 --> 03:42.270
That's why we needed you.

03:42.370 --> 03:43.570
It's heartbreaking.

03:43.670 --> 03:45.240
But yet, you...

03:45.340 --> 03:47.480
you're more concerned about
everybody else but yourself.

03:47.580 --> 03:49.980
Well, of course.
They're my family.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.250
I'm a Christian.
I know where I'm going.

03:52.350 --> 03:54.650
It's okay.

03:54.750 --> 03:56.420
It's just...

03:56.520 --> 03:58.990
I don't wanna
leave my family this way.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.930
It's like
there's a war here.

04:03.990 --> 04:06.730
I have to live
until it is done.

04:09.530 --> 04:11.800
Who exactly lives
in the house now?

04:11.900 --> 04:13.370
My husband and I.

04:13.470 --> 04:16.399
My daughter, um...

04:16.510 --> 04:19.670
moved out recently.

04:19.810 --> 04:22.280
She can't live here.

04:22.380 --> 04:24.850
The house basically
drove her out.

04:24.950 --> 04:27.550
Okay. Do you know any history
about the house?

04:27.650 --> 04:30.550
My daughter was here
with her fiancé Marcus,

04:30.650 --> 04:32.850
and he passed away
in the living room.

04:35.630 --> 04:36.990
How long ago was this?

04:37.090 --> 04:39.260
- Three, 4 years ago.
- Okay.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.960
What did he die of?

04:41.060 --> 04:44.000
Um, some type
of heart condition.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.500
So I'll look into that.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.240
Lorie, how long have
you guys lived here?

04:48.340 --> 04:50.140
- About 19 years.
- Okay.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.010
Did you ever talk
to the previous owners,

04:52.110 --> 04:53.980
if they've had problems
or anything like that?

04:54.080 --> 04:55.610
My mama owned this home,

04:55.710 --> 05:00.250
and she gave it to us
shortly after we got married.

05:00.350 --> 05:01.420
Is your mom still alive?

05:01.520 --> 05:03.480
No. She, um...

05:03.590 --> 05:05.250
- This her here?
- Yes.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.690
- When'd she pass?
-2008.

05:07.790 --> 05:09.890
- How old was she?
-78.

05:09.990 --> 05:11.230
What'd she die of?

05:11.330 --> 05:13.060
Breast cancer.

05:16.500 --> 05:20.540
So there's a...
older woman here.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.340
So I guess she recently died
or something.

05:27.180 --> 05:30.350
She has very,
very short curly hair.

05:30.410 --> 05:32.950
With her, I get a lotta eights.

05:33.050 --> 05:35.780
1998 or 2008.

05:35.890 --> 05:38.090
She was 68.

05:38.190 --> 05:40.820
She was worried about,

05:40.920 --> 05:43.360
um, her grandchild.

05:43.460 --> 05:45.230
She's afraid.

05:48.200 --> 05:53.200
We've always had activity,
but it's gotten a lot worse.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.140
What's goin' on
in the house?

05:55.240 --> 05:58.570
Voices, things moving,

05:58.680 --> 06:02.810
physical attacks,
and personality changes.

06:02.910 --> 06:07.450
Okay. What do you mean
by personality changes?

06:07.580 --> 06:10.720
My husband.

06:10.820 --> 06:13.150
He's changed so much.

06:13.260 --> 06:14.320
In what way?

06:14.420 --> 06:16.760
There's times
when he'll enter a room,

06:16.860 --> 06:18.030
and he's fine.

06:18.130 --> 06:21.960
And he comes back,
and he has this glazed mean,

06:22.070 --> 06:23.330
evil look.

06:23.430 --> 06:27.270
I'm scared when it happens.

06:27.370 --> 06:30.740
He'll say something or throw
something or punch something,

06:30.840 --> 06:33.170
and then he runs outside.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.910
You don't think it's frustration
about you and your sickness?

06:36.010 --> 06:37.310
I'm sure he's frustrated,

06:37.410 --> 06:42.380
but that doesn't cause
the outbursts of evil anger.

06:42.490 --> 06:45.990
I've even talked to him
about possibly leaving him.

06:46.090 --> 06:49.620
I mean, we've been together
22 years.

06:49.730 --> 06:50.960
You break my heart.

06:51.060 --> 06:53.390
I'm sorry.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.800
I'm just glad you came

06:55.900 --> 07:00.640
because I know if anybody
can help, it's you.

07:00.740 --> 07:02.940
I promise
I'm gonna try my best.

07:06.740 --> 07:11.250
So I'm definitely
seeing a big blob.

07:11.350 --> 07:15.250
And it's, like,
moving like a pulse.

07:15.350 --> 07:18.450
Goes up into the ceiling.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.320
And then it has veins.

07:20.420 --> 07:22.460
Like, it looks
like blood vessels.

07:22.560 --> 07:23.760
What is this thing?

07:23.830 --> 07:25.030
It's a manifestation

07:25.130 --> 07:27.230
of all the negativity
that's here.

07:27.330 --> 07:29.730
Sucked it all in.

07:29.830 --> 07:33.970
One living person
is being eaten by this thing.

07:34.040 --> 07:35.840
The weak ones, it gets.

07:35.940 --> 07:37.970
So they're probably sick

07:38.070 --> 07:40.170
or they might be dying.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.410
Losing their personality.

07:42.510 --> 07:46.010
So psychologically and mentally,
they're kind of, like...

07:46.120 --> 07:49.250
not them anymore.

07:49.350 --> 07:54.460
This blob
is the worst thing here.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.760
So what's goin' on
in the bedroom here?

08:02.870 --> 08:05.970
I have a statue
that I used to, um,

08:06.070 --> 08:08.200
have just above my head.

08:08.300 --> 08:09.440
And I was sleeping,

08:09.540 --> 08:13.880
and it struck me real hard
in the head.

08:13.980 --> 08:15.110
Was it on that lower shelf?

08:15.210 --> 08:16.340
Yes.

08:16.450 --> 08:18.410
It felt like it was

08:18.520 --> 08:22.150
picked up and struck me,

08:22.250 --> 08:25.390
like it was tryin'
to kill me.

08:25.490 --> 08:28.360
Okay. So anything else happen
in here?

08:28.420 --> 08:33.230
I was upstairs, um, repacking
a box of Marcus' things

08:33.330 --> 08:34.700
to give to my daughter.

08:34.799 --> 08:37.870
Marcus is your daughter's fiancé
who died in the house.
Yes.

08:37.970 --> 08:42.370
And I was grabbed
real hard and held.

08:42.470 --> 08:44.510
And then I got marks on me.

08:44.570 --> 08:46.040
What, like human hands
were touching you?

08:46.140 --> 08:49.240
Yes, like that.
I was grabbed hard.

08:49.350 --> 08:51.350
And how long did that last,
that feeling?

08:51.450 --> 08:52.680
About 5 minutes.

08:52.780 --> 08:55.280
I think it was Marcus
trying to stop me.

08:55.390 --> 08:57.920
I don't think he wanted
his stuff to leave.

08:58.020 --> 09:00.590
Okay. So has anything else
physical like that happen?

09:00.690 --> 09:02.190
I watched my husband

09:02.290 --> 09:05.060
being shook violently
back and forth.

09:05.160 --> 09:08.330
And he wakes up finally
and says, "What?"

09:08.430 --> 09:12.930
And I go, "It wasn't me
that shook you awake."

09:13.040 --> 09:14.400
Does he suffer from seizures
at all?

09:14.500 --> 09:16.400
- Never.
- Well, you mentioned earlier

09:16.510 --> 09:19.110
about your husband's
personality changes.

09:19.210 --> 09:20.980
What about you?
Have you had any of that?

09:21.080 --> 09:22.180
Yeah.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.440
Okay.

09:23.550 --> 09:24.810
I'll be
in the kitchen cooking,

09:24.910 --> 09:28.250
and I'll get a thought
real strong.

09:28.350 --> 09:30.790
Somebody talking in my head,

09:30.890 --> 09:33.390
"Why don't you just take
that knife and put it in there?

09:33.490 --> 09:35.390
You'll be over."

09:35.490 --> 09:38.190
And I'm like, "No!"

09:38.290 --> 09:40.290
How often does this happen?

09:40.400 --> 09:42.160
Every day.

09:45.970 --> 09:49.840
Somebody's in
the kitchen cooking.

09:49.940 --> 09:53.010
And then I see, like,
a knife in my hand.

09:53.110 --> 09:57.210
And I'm gonna go up
and stab that person.

09:57.310 --> 10:00.750
This is, like, a vision.

10:00.850 --> 10:04.150
This blob --
that's what it wants.

10:04.250 --> 10:05.990
It wants people
to hurt each other

10:06.090 --> 10:08.460
'cause then it gets bigger.

10:08.560 --> 10:11.860
It needs to eat to stay alive,

10:11.960 --> 10:14.130
to grow, to survive.

10:35.860 --> 10:38.400
So, Roy, I was talkin'
to, Lorie.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.560
I'm sorry about
what she's goin' through.

10:40.670 --> 10:43.230
She says that the house
has changed your personality.

10:43.340 --> 10:44.470
Do you agree with that?

10:44.570 --> 10:46.100
Yeah. I do.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.440
So how are you being
affected emotionally?

10:48.540 --> 10:51.210
Just violent thoughts.

10:51.310 --> 10:54.080
You know, when you wake up
out of a sound sleep,

10:54.180 --> 10:57.950
you hear a dog barkin', you know
the dog wants to go out.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.490
But by the time you get to her
to let her out,

11:02.590 --> 11:04.420
all you wanna do
is kill her.

11:04.520 --> 11:05.660
Dog ran from me.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.260
I wanted to grab her
and choke her.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.060
I was chasin' her
to kill her.

11:10.160 --> 11:13.200
Somethin's tellin' me,
"Get outside. Get outside."

11:13.300 --> 11:15.970
I open the door.
I go outside.

11:16.070 --> 11:18.440
I'm out there
shaking my head saying,

11:18.540 --> 11:21.070
"Get the freak
outta my head!"

11:21.170 --> 11:23.310
It's, like, when it comes
outta me, I'll stand there.

11:23.410 --> 11:27.810
And I'm, like, "What the hell
is doin' this?"

11:27.910 --> 11:30.450
But if I coulda got ahold
of that dog, I woulda killed it.

11:35.790 --> 11:39.460
This thing, it affects everybody
in the house.

11:39.560 --> 11:44.090
It gives them, um, nightmares.

11:46.930 --> 11:50.300
And visions
of hurting each other.

11:51.970 --> 11:55.310
This could actually
manipulate living people

11:55.410 --> 11:57.210
into harming one another.

12:02.380 --> 12:05.780
Okay, so as far as experiences
go, have you had any?

12:05.880 --> 12:08.720
- Bad smells.
- What kinda smell?

12:08.790 --> 12:11.490
- A smell like death.
- Okay.

12:11.590 --> 12:13.920
I mean, this is a big house,
and you've got woods everywhere.

12:14.030 --> 12:15.390
Dead animal, maybe?

12:15.490 --> 12:18.360
No. There's no dead animals
in my house.

12:18.460 --> 12:19.700
All right.
Anything else?

12:19.800 --> 12:20.830
I see shadows all the time.

12:20.930 --> 12:22.130
Okay.
Where do you see those?

12:22.230 --> 12:24.630
Mainly downstairs,
watchin' TV.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.570
You can see 'em run by
the TV.

12:27.670 --> 12:29.210
Have you ever seen 'em
up here?

12:29.310 --> 12:30.610
Only once.

12:30.710 --> 12:31.910
Okay, when was that?

12:32.010 --> 12:33.310
When I was held down.

12:33.410 --> 12:34.580
Tell me about what happened.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.610
Well, I was sleepin'
one night.

12:36.720 --> 12:41.220
And somethin' woke me up,
and I seen a big, black mass

12:41.320 --> 12:44.090
over top of me,
holdin' me down.

12:44.190 --> 12:45.160
It started floatin' back.

12:45.260 --> 12:46.520
I jumped up outta bed
and I says,

12:46.590 --> 12:49.360
"Is that all you've got,
you son of a ****?

12:49.460 --> 12:52.560
Don't you <i> ever</i> touch me
again."

12:52.660 --> 12:54.360
And then it dissipated.

12:54.470 --> 12:57.170
- Now you seem angry.
- I am angry.

12:57.270 --> 12:59.900
It's, like, okay,
you wanna pick on me? Fine.

13:00.010 --> 13:02.970
I could...I'll --
I'll handle it.
Right.

13:03.070 --> 13:04.910
But when
you start interferin'

13:05.010 --> 13:07.180
and gettin' to my family
and my wife,

13:07.280 --> 13:10.550
now it's time to do somethin'
and do it now.

13:10.650 --> 13:12.420
Right.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.650
There's this dude.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.820
He's **** intense.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.120
İf you're, like,
thinking about him

13:21.230 --> 13:23.360
or talking about him
or anything like that,

13:23.460 --> 13:25.400
he's, like, right on top of you.

13:28.870 --> 13:31.430
I was getting stuff on his wife.

13:31.540 --> 13:32.770
She smells really bad.

13:32.870 --> 13:35.100
I think living people
can smell her.

13:35.170 --> 13:36.840
She does look like

13:36.940 --> 13:39.440
a weird **** version
of a shadow person.

13:40.950 --> 13:44.580
And the thing that she does is,
like, she'll be, like...

13:44.680 --> 13:47.650
at their beds and watching.

13:54.360 --> 13:55.830
So, Kristina, I understand
that you moved out

13:55.930 --> 13:57.630
about 6 months ago.
- Yes.

13:57.730 --> 13:58.760
Okay.

13:58.860 --> 14:00.030
What was the reason for that?

14:00.130 --> 14:02.830
Mostly because of the activity
in the house.

14:02.930 --> 14:05.270
Now I know it's a tough subject
to talk about,

14:05.370 --> 14:08.440
but I understand, um,
your fiancé...

14:08.540 --> 14:10.210
Had passed away in the house.

14:10.310 --> 14:12.310
Yes.
In the living room.

14:12.380 --> 14:13.880
He was my best friend.

14:13.980 --> 14:16.080
It's the hardest thing I've ever
had to go through in my life.

14:16.180 --> 14:17.410
I can imagine.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.920
I didn't think I was gonna
make it through it.

14:20.020 --> 14:22.820
I know you've had experiences.
So tell me about some of 'em.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.490
Um, one night I woke up
in the middle of the night,

14:25.590 --> 14:27.960
and there was an old man
standing at the end of my bed

14:28.090 --> 14:29.990
staring at me.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.200
And he was just there
for, like, a couple seconds,

14:32.300 --> 14:33.900
and then he disappeared.

14:33.970 --> 14:35.060
So okay, anything else?

14:35.170 --> 14:37.370
Bad anxiety attacks.
I mean, right now,

14:37.470 --> 14:39.500
I- I'm havin'
a hard time breathing.

14:39.570 --> 14:42.740
I- I just feel like somethin's
really heavy on my chest

14:42.840 --> 14:44.740
and that my heart
goes outta rhythm.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.440
And I start sweating
really bad.

14:47.550 --> 14:49.810
- Okay.
- Sometimes I feel overwhelmed,

14:49.880 --> 14:51.950
like I just wanna
break down crying.

14:52.050 --> 14:53.880
And it's uncontrollable.

14:56.660 --> 15:00.360
This dude would affect
living people,

15:00.460 --> 15:03.130
make them feel a lotta stress.

15:03.230 --> 15:05.700
If anybody would have
a problem with him living-wise,

15:05.800 --> 15:09.470
it would be any female
in this house.

15:09.570 --> 15:14.500
He probably does bad things
to women here.

15:17.940 --> 15:20.540
Pain. Lots of pain.

15:20.650 --> 15:22.910
My god.

15:22.980 --> 15:25.350
I feel like I have
this pain in my back.

15:30.220 --> 15:33.120
And I feel nauseous, too.

15:33.190 --> 15:35.220
What the **** is happening?

15:47.970 --> 15:49.610
Look, 39-year-old guys

15:49.710 --> 15:51.210
just don't drop dead
of heart attacks.

15:51.310 --> 15:53.010
There's gotta be more to it.

15:53.110 --> 15:56.150
I reached out to Marcus' mom,
who's agreed to speak to me.

15:56.250 --> 15:57.980
She says he did have
a condition,

15:58.080 --> 16:00.350
and thinks his death
could have been prevented.

16:06.060 --> 16:08.060
I know this is
a tough subject.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.290
And I understand Marcus
did pass away in the house

16:10.360 --> 16:11.630
I'm investigating.
- Yes.

16:11.730 --> 16:13.360
Before we even get
to any of that stuff,

16:13.460 --> 16:15.030
tell -- tell me about
your son.

16:15.130 --> 16:16.400
This is a picture
of my son.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.330
He's the oldest of five.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.500
Okay.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.170
Big, lovable guy.

16:22.270 --> 16:24.670
He was like a big kid.
- Okay.

16:24.780 --> 16:27.240
On the phone, you had mentioned
Marcus had a condition.

16:27.350 --> 16:30.450
He had what is called
Atrial Septal Defect,

16:30.550 --> 16:33.250
which is one of
the causes of his death.

16:33.350 --> 16:35.350
It's actually
a hole in the wall

16:35.450 --> 16:38.890
in between the two,
top chambers of the heart.

16:41.260 --> 16:42.830
Did he take it serious?

16:42.930 --> 16:46.900
He did not, you know,
take the best care of himself.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.570
He, smoked cigarettes
when he was younger.

16:49.670 --> 16:53.200
And, he wasn't one
to work out or anything.

16:53.270 --> 16:54.740
My son was a chef.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.170
Chefs love food.
- Right.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.110
They love rich foods.

16:59.180 --> 17:00.780
When's the last time
you had seen him?

17:00.880 --> 17:05.750
Last time I saw him
was Thanksgiving Day, 2011.

17:05.849 --> 17:08.280
Okay. And how soon after that
did he pass?

17:08.390 --> 17:10.619
He passed away
on December 19th.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.250
I'm assuming
they did an autopsy?

17:12.359 --> 17:15.790
Yes. Here's a copy
of the autopsy report.

17:15.859 --> 17:21.000
The autopsy found that he had
a grossly enlarged heart.

17:21.069 --> 17:22.700
His heart basically
just gave up.

17:22.800 --> 17:26.700
Okay. Now you think
this could've been prevented.

17:26.770 --> 17:30.040
Had he been going to a doctor
like he should've, yes.

17:30.140 --> 17:33.310
I don't know how a parent could
lose a child. It's devastating.

17:33.410 --> 17:35.110
Very devastating.

17:35.210 --> 17:37.880
Lorie thinks he's still around
the house. How 'bout you?

17:37.980 --> 17:41.780
I do.
He loved Lorie and Roy.

17:41.890 --> 17:43.720
They were like
a second family to him.

17:43.820 --> 17:46.260
I wouldn't be surprised at all
if he is around.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.230
Especially, ya know,
looking after them.

17:58.840 --> 18:03.470
There's, like, a dead guy
in here a lot.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.710
He's a big guy.
He was stocky.

18:05.810 --> 18:08.680
He smoked a lot.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.980
He ate a lot of bad stuff.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.220
I think he died
from a heart attack.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.650
Very sudden, very quick.

18:15.750 --> 18:19.920
He's very angry,
very angry about it.

18:19.990 --> 18:21.890
He's trying to get out,
and he can't.

18:21.990 --> 18:24.260
None of the dead people
can get outta here.

18:30.070 --> 18:32.570
So far, I've got
a terminally ill client

18:32.670 --> 18:36.010
whose family's being torn apart
by bizarre activity,

18:36.110 --> 18:37.710
and a young man
who died of a heart attack

18:37.810 --> 18:39.740
right inside their house.

18:39.840 --> 18:42.750
But I need to see
if there's anything more.

18:42.850 --> 18:44.080
Diggin' through old records,

18:44.180 --> 18:47.320
I find a notorious gangster
named Cadillac Charlie.

18:47.390 --> 18:50.720
In 1962, he and his son were
killed in a gruesome car bombing

18:50.820 --> 18:53.560
only 600 feet
from Lorie's property.

18:53.660 --> 18:55.890
Turns out, they were the victims
of a mob hit.

18:55.990 --> 18:57.460
Now I'm not sure
how it's gonna help my case,

18:57.560 --> 18:59.360
but I gotta check this one out.

19:05.470 --> 19:08.240
So, Tom, I came across a mob hit
near my client's house.

19:08.310 --> 19:10.670
I was even surprised to know
there was any mob in Youngstown.

19:10.780 --> 19:14.110
Actually, Youngstown was
a pretty big mob city.

19:14.180 --> 19:16.350
Now were car bombs like the one
near my client's property

19:16.450 --> 19:18.080
a common way
to take people out?

19:18.180 --> 19:20.620
In the --
in the 10 or 11 years before,

19:20.720 --> 19:23.190
Cadillac Charlie
was blown up,

19:23.290 --> 19:26.290
there were, like,
81 car bombings.

19:26.390 --> 19:27.590
It drew the attention

19:27.690 --> 19:28.760
of the Attorney General
of the United States --

19:28.860 --> 19:30.290
Robert Kennedy.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.030
And - Kennedy,
called J. Edgar Hoover

19:33.130 --> 19:35.700
and got the FBI
involved in the case.

19:40.910 --> 19:42.470
Something happened here.

19:42.570 --> 19:46.440
And all these men
were in the process of dying.

19:46.510 --> 19:50.150
I didn't see a battle or a war,
anything like that.

19:50.250 --> 19:53.650
There's, like, piles and piles
and piles of dead bodies.

19:53.750 --> 19:55.780
- How many?
- Like, hundreds.

19:57.590 --> 20:00.890
These people, these men,
were **** up.

20:00.990 --> 20:03.860
Like, some of 'em missin' a leg.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.830
You know, they maybe got a shirt
and there's blood all over it.

20:06.930 --> 20:12.500
Somehow, it reached all the way
to Washington, DC.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.470
I saw a big, round table

20:14.570 --> 20:17.010
with seven or eight politicians

20:17.110 --> 20:20.110
discussing men dying here.

20:20.210 --> 20:21.810
And it was a big deal.

20:22.950 --> 20:24.050
Cadillac Charlie.

20:24.150 --> 20:26.020
This guy sounds like
a made guy, a wise guy.

20:26.120 --> 20:27.480
What do we know
about him?

20:27.590 --> 20:29.350
He's
a Sicilian immigrant.

20:29.420 --> 20:31.520
Came to the United States
in 1921.

20:31.620 --> 20:34.660
This is a picture here
of, of Charlie.

20:36.060 --> 20:38.430
Not much is known about him
the first 10 or 15 years

20:38.530 --> 20:39.600
he's in the country.

20:39.700 --> 20:42.460
And then a few years later,
in, in 1940,

20:42.570 --> 20:44.000
he first shows up
in Youngstown,

20:44.100 --> 20:45.130
gets involved with

20:45.240 --> 20:47.400
the organized crime figures
in town.

20:47.510 --> 20:49.440
Um, he buys a pool hall,

20:49.540 --> 20:51.670
slash lottery house.

20:51.780 --> 20:52.810
He rose pretty fast.

20:52.910 --> 20:54.580
And,
by the time, -

20:54.680 --> 20:56.810
the early '50s rolled around,
he was --

20:56.910 --> 20:58.580
he was the man
in Youngstown.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.850
So, Tom, I know the house
he lived in

21:00.950 --> 21:02.580
is a pretty suburban area,

21:02.690 --> 21:03.650
by my client's house.

21:03.750 --> 21:06.190
Um, I assume
he had a family.

21:06.290 --> 21:07.260
Yeah, he did.

21:07.360 --> 21:08.690
He lived there
with his second wife.

21:08.790 --> 21:11.430
She was about 14 years younger
than he was.

21:11.530 --> 21:13.900
He had,
four kids total.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.930
Okay. So how did this whole
car bombing go down?

21:17.030 --> 21:19.070
Well, the bombing and --
and the murder occurred,

21:19.170 --> 21:22.340
the day after Thanksgiving,
November 23rd, 1962.

21:22.440 --> 21:23.810
Okay.
It's Friday morning.

21:23.910 --> 21:25.910
Charlie's kids
got football practice.

21:26.010 --> 21:28.440
Okay.
Charlie and Tommy
get in the car,

21:28.550 --> 21:30.780
turns the ignition to the car
and ka-boom, the -- the --

21:30.880 --> 21:33.380
the whole --
the whole car blows up.

21:33.450 --> 21:34.920
The garage blows up.
He's blown --

21:35.020 --> 21:36.950
Him and his son
are both blown to bits.

21:37.050 --> 21:38.650
Here's a photo of,
of his son.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.090
His 11-year-old son that was,
killed in the, um,

21:41.190 --> 21:42.490
the car bombing.

21:42.590 --> 21:44.060
Jeez.

21:44.160 --> 21:46.660
Any idea why this guy was
the victim of a mob hit?

21:46.760 --> 21:48.500
Well, there was a couple
of, of --

21:48.600 --> 21:49.830
of theories runnin' around.

21:49.930 --> 21:52.530
One of 'em was that he --
he was deeply in debt.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.770
But nobody really knows
for sure.

21:54.910 --> 21:56.740
Nobody's ever collared
for this or arrested?

21:56.840 --> 21:58.040
No one was every arrested.

21:58.140 --> 21:59.880
Okay.

22:02.950 --> 22:04.850
I don't like this guy.

22:04.950 --> 22:07.450
The angry man
is pulling me back upstairs,

22:07.550 --> 22:09.420
and he's bragging
about all the terrible things

22:09.520 --> 22:10.650
he did in life.

22:10.760 --> 22:14.720
He says he <i> owned</i> men
or laborers.

22:14.830 --> 22:16.530
He's wearing, like, a suit.

22:16.590 --> 22:19.660
I guess he owned...businesses?

22:19.760 --> 22:22.530
I see, like,
two small businesses.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.630
And he's definitely
from back east.

22:25.740 --> 22:27.370
And he moved here.

22:27.470 --> 22:29.770
Maybe he <i> was</i> in prison.

22:29.870 --> 22:32.670
I see a fire,
and I see him kind of burnt.

22:34.510 --> 22:36.180
He's, like, charred.

22:36.280 --> 22:39.310
He died,
and was murdered apparently.

22:39.420 --> 22:41.120
And he's very
pissed off about it.

22:41.220 --> 22:44.520
He feels like it was, you know,
he didn't deserve it.

22:44.620 --> 22:46.890
He says, "I didn't deserve it.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.190
I didn't deserve it."

22:48.290 --> 22:51.130
He says it wasn't an accident.

22:51.230 --> 22:53.060
It was deliberate.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.870

unexplained activity

23:16.500 --> 23:18.100
During my research,
a former owner

23:18.210 --> 23:20.210
of my client's property
caught my attention.

23:20.310 --> 23:21.770
So I had a local genealogist

23:21.880 --> 23:24.010
look into this guy,
Paul Wick, for me.

23:24.110 --> 23:26.110
She just called me back
and said this guy's story

23:26.210 --> 23:29.320
is filled with tragedy,
heartbreak, and bankruptcy.

23:34.920 --> 23:37.990
So, Kimberly, why did you want
to come here to talk?

23:38.090 --> 23:39.690
Because in its better days,

23:39.790 --> 23:43.330
this was a mill a lot like
what Paul Wick ran.

23:43.430 --> 23:44.830
I figured this would be
a good place

23:44.930 --> 23:46.470
to tell you his story.

23:46.570 --> 23:47.900
Okay.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.570
So how does Paul wind up
with my client's property?

23:50.670 --> 23:52.440
When he was 14 years old,

23:52.540 --> 23:56.440
Daddy handed him, basically,
117 acres.

23:56.540 --> 24:00.580
Part of that is where
your client's house sits.

24:00.680 --> 24:03.680
Here is a picture of him
right here.

24:03.790 --> 24:05.280
All right.
So Paul, does he get married?

24:05.390 --> 24:07.050
Does he stay single?
What's his story?

24:07.160 --> 24:09.590
He does get married
when he's 22 years old.

24:09.690 --> 24:12.190
His wife is named
Susan Bull.

24:12.290 --> 24:13.760
And here is her picture.

24:13.860 --> 24:17.860
They got married in 1846
and the raised six kids.

24:17.970 --> 24:19.270
Now, Kimberly,
you mentioned on the phone

24:19.370 --> 24:20.830
that this guy
suffered from heartbreak,

24:20.940 --> 24:22.300
tragedy, and bankruptcy.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.870
Let's start with heartbreak.
What happened?

24:23.970 --> 24:28.170
1882, Susan unexpectedly died
of heart disease...

24:28.280 --> 24:29.340
Okay.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.540
...leaving him to raise
six kids.

24:31.650 --> 24:33.510
Okay, so let's move on
to the tragedy.

24:33.620 --> 24:36.950
Well, one of Paul's holdings
was an iron mill.

24:37.050 --> 24:40.490
Would've been a lot like this
in its better day.

24:40.590 --> 24:43.190
Paul's iron mill
had 10 boilers.
Okay.

24:43.260 --> 24:45.520
August 28th, 1872,

24:45.630 --> 24:48.260
nine of the 10 boilers
exploded.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.060
There were three fatalities.

24:50.160 --> 24:52.730
A one-ton piece
of one of the boilers

24:52.830 --> 24:54.770
flew a quarter of a mile away

24:54.870 --> 24:57.500
and fell into a house,

24:57.610 --> 25:00.240
killing a mother
and a 9-month-old son.

25:00.340 --> 25:02.380
Jeez.

25:02.480 --> 25:03.980
All right,
now these explosions,

25:04.080 --> 25:05.850
is that what leads to
his bankruptcy?

25:05.950 --> 25:07.310
Partially.

25:07.420 --> 25:10.720
But back in 1883, Youngstown
was going through a depression,

25:10.790 --> 25:13.050
especially
in the iron industry.

25:13.150 --> 25:15.220
There were signs,
but he ignored 'em.

25:15.320 --> 25:19.090
For the next 7 years,
he ties things up in court.

25:19.190 --> 25:23.030
Ten days after the final
court hearing, Paul Wick dies.

25:23.130 --> 25:25.400
He was a broken man.

25:28.370 --> 25:30.270
Heartache, tragedy,
and bankruptcy.

25:30.370 --> 25:33.210
You weren't kidding.
It followed him
his entire life.

25:37.210 --> 25:39.450
What this thing is,

25:39.550 --> 25:42.920
is a culmination

25:43.020 --> 25:46.520
of all the negativity

25:46.620 --> 25:52.320
that has been within
these walls.

25:52.430 --> 25:53.830
Even though the angry dead man

25:53.900 --> 25:57.330
poses a serious threat to
the living women in the house,

25:57.430 --> 26:00.830
I'm most concerned about
this thing in the dining room.

26:00.940 --> 26:05.940
It's absorbed living energy
from living people.

26:06.040 --> 26:08.570
Horrible things
that it's absorbed.

26:08.680 --> 26:13.610
It's collected
into this big blob.

26:13.720 --> 26:16.680
What happens if it were
to continue to -- to get bigger?

26:16.780 --> 26:22.320
It'll then become intertwined
with the house...

26:22.420 --> 26:26.360
to the point where it'll just
meld within the walls.

26:26.460 --> 26:29.860
And then it'll become one
with the house, the structure.

26:29.960 --> 26:33.900
And the structure is actually
like a living organism.

26:36.740 --> 26:40.140
And then, it does form
a consciousness over time.

26:40.240 --> 26:45.110
And then it can project
entities, to do harm.

26:45.210 --> 26:47.780
So it could kill them.

26:54.920 --> 26:57.160
I saw several disturbing things
on my walk,

26:57.260 --> 26:59.160
but two stood out the most.

26:59.260 --> 27:00.990
First, the angry man.

27:01.100 --> 27:04.800
He was, I believe,
in his 40s.

27:07.140 --> 27:09.100
Like, stocky.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.700
A very, like, thick neck.

27:11.810 --> 27:15.110
Next, I described the thing
growing in the dining room.

27:15.210 --> 27:18.880
It's this big, black,

27:18.980 --> 27:21.180
undulating mass.

27:21.280 --> 27:24.420
And it looked like it was
made out of tar.

27:24.520 --> 27:27.720
And it had, like, veins.

27:30.860 --> 27:32.590
Amy,
is this what you saw?

27:36.060 --> 27:37.500
Yes, that's who I saw.

27:57.740 --> 28:00.570
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

28:00.670 --> 28:01.870
we're ready
to reveal our findings

28:01.970 --> 28:05.110
to each other and our clients
for the first time.

28:05.210 --> 28:08.110
Amy, I want you to meet
Lorie and her husband Roy.

28:08.210 --> 28:10.010
There is no easy way
to say this,

28:10.110 --> 28:12.050
but Lorie doesn't have
much time left.

28:12.150 --> 28:15.720
She's been diagnosed
with stage IV cancer,

28:15.820 --> 28:19.360
and the doctors give her
about 2 months to live.

28:19.460 --> 28:21.690
Now the activity here
is pretty bad.

28:21.790 --> 28:23.390
And Lorie's dying wish

28:23.490 --> 28:27.060
is to know her family's gonna
be okay once she's gone.

28:27.170 --> 28:29.770
Now that Amy knows a little bit
about you guys,

28:29.870 --> 28:32.940
I'm gonna ask her
to describe her walk for us.

28:33.040 --> 28:37.470
There's something very unusual
about this particular area.

28:37.580 --> 28:41.540
What I saw was that
the dead can't move on.

28:41.650 --> 28:42.850
They're trapped.

28:42.950 --> 28:48.880
And I saw a wall
surrounding this property.

28:48.990 --> 28:52.690
When I walked into the house,
I went into the master bedroom,

28:52.790 --> 28:56.960
and I saw a dead man
in there.

28:57.060 --> 28:59.660
Um, he was
extremely stressed out.

28:59.760 --> 29:03.470
This was very recent,
within the last 10 years.

29:03.570 --> 29:05.300
I got that he was
a big, stocky guy

29:05.400 --> 29:07.200
who did a lotta hard work.

29:07.310 --> 29:09.670
I got that he was
unfortunately unhealthy,

29:09.770 --> 29:11.740
and smoked and ate
a lot of bad food.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.640
And that he died
very suddenly,

29:13.710 --> 29:15.380
from a heart attack.

29:15.480 --> 29:19.820
And he's extremely upset
about that as well.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.650
We kinda think we know
this might be, right?

29:21.750 --> 29:22.920
Yeah.

29:23.020 --> 29:25.350
Lorie's daughter, Kristina,
was living here

29:25.460 --> 29:28.920
with her fiancé Marcus,
for about 2 months.

29:29.030 --> 29:33.830
I got a picture of Marcus here
with Kristina and their dogs.

29:33.930 --> 29:37.330
Marcus was born
with a Atrial Septal Defect.

29:38.670 --> 29:42.070
Despite that, he did lead
an unhealthy lifestyle.

29:42.170 --> 29:44.010
He had smoked.
He ate a lotta rich foods.

29:44.110 --> 29:45.640
He was a chef.

29:45.710 --> 29:47.940
Now, on December 19th, 2011,

29:48.050 --> 29:51.350
he was sitting right here
in this room with Kristina,

29:51.420 --> 29:53.220
um, when his heart stopped.

29:53.320 --> 29:56.420
He was only 39 years old.

29:56.550 --> 29:59.960
Now does this photo look like
the person you ran into?

30:00.060 --> 30:01.790
I would say yes.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.400
Tell Amy the story
about the bruise around the arm.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.660
I was upstairs.

30:07.770 --> 30:11.170
I was
repacking Marcus' things,

30:11.270 --> 30:14.240
and arms grabbed me.

30:14.340 --> 30:15.970
And I began to burn.

30:16.070 --> 30:18.240
It hurt so badly.

30:18.310 --> 30:20.310
And I'm like, "No!"

30:20.410 --> 30:23.680
And I thought it was Marcus
the minute it happened.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.480
I don't get the impression
that he --

30:26.580 --> 30:28.120
that he would harm anyone.

30:28.220 --> 30:30.050
No, I don't either.

30:30.150 --> 30:32.560
I don't think he wanted
his stuff to leave.

30:32.660 --> 30:34.390
I loved him.

30:39.060 --> 30:40.900
The next people that I met,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.870
when they were alive,
they were a couple.

30:43.970 --> 30:47.040
The wife is
an emotional wreck.

30:47.140 --> 30:49.210
Extremely depressed.

30:49.310 --> 30:50.640
I think that
the living would --

30:50.710 --> 30:53.880
would associate her
with, like, a shadow person,

30:53.980 --> 30:56.950
um, because she is
all black.

30:57.050 --> 31:00.850
And she likes to watch
people in the beds.

31:00.950 --> 31:04.250
The other thing is she doesn't,
smell very good.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.560
Now you see shadows.

31:06.660 --> 31:07.960
Yeah. I see shadows,

31:08.060 --> 31:11.160
mostly when I'm sittin' here
watchin' TV.

31:11.260 --> 31:13.130
And I'll see a shadow...

31:13.230 --> 31:15.160
real fast go by the TV.

31:15.270 --> 31:17.670
- Okay.
- You mentioned a smell, right?

31:17.740 --> 31:20.240
Yeah.

31:20.340 --> 31:23.910
All the time.
It's, like, walkin' past death.

31:25.740 --> 31:28.010
Her husband is the one
I'm more concerned about.

31:28.110 --> 31:31.210
He was
an <i> extremely</i> angry man.

31:31.320 --> 31:35.220
I felt like he was insane.

31:35.320 --> 31:37.950
He goes all over the house.

31:38.060 --> 31:40.620
He has major issues
with women.

31:40.730 --> 31:44.230
He gets really pissy if somebody
starts talking about him.

31:44.330 --> 31:46.330
And he'll get right up on
that person,

31:46.430 --> 31:48.560
like, right in their space.

31:48.670 --> 31:51.370
This'll make a living person
very stressed out.

31:51.470 --> 31:56.840
Um, I think that living people
might be able to see him.

31:56.940 --> 31:58.210
Lorie got
physically attacked by --

31:58.310 --> 32:01.740
There's this horn-shaped
kind of figurine statue thing

32:01.850 --> 32:02.910
with elephants on it.

32:03.010 --> 32:04.910
I was in bed
and I was sleeping.

32:05.020 --> 32:07.420
And it was low enough

32:07.520 --> 32:09.850
that it shoulda just
fallen on my chest.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.890
But it bashed me
in the head.

32:13.990 --> 32:16.290
And I still have pain.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.630
Yeah. He's a bully.

32:18.730 --> 32:20.330
The other thing is anxiety
throughout the house.

32:20.430 --> 32:22.930
Everybody has anxiety attacks.

32:23.030 --> 32:25.470
I'm actually dizzy,
like I could pass out.

32:25.570 --> 32:27.900
I don't know why.

32:27.970 --> 32:31.140
This house...

32:32.580 --> 32:34.480
Yeah.

32:34.580 --> 32:36.750
You get anything on this guy,
like who he was?

32:36.850 --> 32:38.180
I got that
he'd been in prison.

32:38.250 --> 32:40.420
I got that he was from back east
and that he moved here.

32:40.520 --> 32:44.750
I got that he owned a couple
of small businesses.

32:44.860 --> 32:47.660
I got that he was murdered.

32:47.760 --> 32:52.490
Um, and he feels
like he did not deserve it.

32:52.600 --> 32:55.130
And I got constantly,
him in fire.

32:55.200 --> 32:58.430
Half of his face is, like,
burnt, singed.

32:58.540 --> 33:00.540
Definitely reminds me
of somebody

33:00.640 --> 33:02.610
who came up in my research.

33:02.710 --> 33:04.510
One of the most
notorious gangsters

33:04.610 --> 33:07.140
in Youngstown
lived about 600 feet from here.

33:07.250 --> 33:09.380
His name
was Charles Cavallaro.

33:09.480 --> 33:11.510
He went by the name
of Cadillac Charlie.

33:11.620 --> 33:13.250
Charlie was
a Sicilian immigrant,

33:13.350 --> 33:14.850
came to the US in 1921.

33:14.950 --> 33:18.050
He lived in New York City.
You said the east coast.

33:18.160 --> 33:20.120
He was in the mob.
He was probably a made guy.

33:20.220 --> 33:21.860
And we know he got arrested
a few times.

33:21.960 --> 33:25.690
Now in 1940,
he moved to Youngstown.

33:25.760 --> 33:28.400
You said something about fire
and him saying he was murdered.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.300
That's about as spot-on
as it gets.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.000
On November 23rd, 1962,

33:33.070 --> 33:35.170
he was gonna take the kids
to football practice.

33:35.270 --> 33:37.610
Charlie turned on the car,
and boom, it exploded.

33:37.710 --> 33:38.910
****.

33:39.010 --> 33:40.880
The car bomb killed him

33:40.980 --> 33:43.410
and his 11-year-old son
Tommy instantly.

33:43.510 --> 33:45.680
Now I have pictures

33:45.780 --> 33:48.780
of Cadillac Charlie.

33:48.890 --> 33:50.790
And his son.

33:52.560 --> 33:54.920
And this is car
after the explosion.

33:57.030 --> 33:59.500
The crime was never solved.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.200
Definitely a mob hit.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.570
My god.

34:03.670 --> 34:05.700
Is that who you think
you saw?

34:05.800 --> 34:07.470
I had a sketch done
of him.

34:11.380 --> 34:13.179
-100% this is him.
- Absolutely.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.610
You tell me if you think
that's him or not.

34:15.710 --> 34:16.850
Yeah.

34:16.949 --> 34:18.350
My.

34:21.420 --> 34:22.750
Yep.

34:22.850 --> 34:24.050
Yeah.

34:24.159 --> 34:25.550
Why would he be here, though?

34:27.560 --> 34:29.489
'Cause there's somethin' else
that's here.

34:34.630 --> 34:36.570
The thing that I'm most
concerned about

34:36.670 --> 34:38.500
is the thing
in the dining room.

34:38.600 --> 34:39.900
It's, like, a big mass.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.739
A big blob.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.139
It has, like veins on it.

34:44.239 --> 34:46.940
And it's, like,
always pulsating.

34:47.040 --> 34:48.280
Like a heart.

34:48.380 --> 34:51.610
This has a very large impact

34:51.719 --> 34:54.080
on anybody in this house.

34:54.190 --> 34:55.880
It feeds on negativity,

34:55.989 --> 35:00.590
and that's how
it gains power and grows.

35:00.690 --> 35:04.660
And I saw one living person
being consumed,

35:04.730 --> 35:09.030
by this thing
on an energetic level.

35:09.100 --> 35:11.400
This living person
would feel like

35:11.500 --> 35:14.570
they were losing themselves,

35:14.640 --> 35:17.010
like they were losing
their personality

35:17.110 --> 35:19.270
and aspects of their being.

35:19.380 --> 35:22.880
This person could be sick
and/or dying.

35:25.520 --> 35:28.080
We talkin' about Lorie here?

35:28.190 --> 35:29.490
Sounds like it.

35:29.590 --> 35:32.190
Yeah.

35:32.290 --> 35:35.320
I feel like I'm here
and not here.

35:35.430 --> 35:38.960
And here and not here.

35:39.060 --> 35:40.500
I was getting

35:40.600 --> 35:45.170
that the living would experience
a lot of nightmares.

35:45.270 --> 35:46.840
And also, visions.

35:46.940 --> 35:48.740
One of the things
that I was shown

35:48.840 --> 35:52.210
was somebody
watching someone cooking.

35:52.280 --> 35:56.350
And all of a sudden, they get
this, like, vision of them,

35:56.450 --> 35:58.110
like, picking up a knife

35:58.220 --> 36:01.980
and walking up
behind the person.

36:02.090 --> 36:06.890
It can manipulate the living
to harm one another.

36:06.990 --> 36:08.760
When I'm in the kitchen,

36:08.860 --> 36:11.360
when I go toward
the sharp knives,

36:11.460 --> 36:13.960
something in my head
tells me,

36:14.030 --> 36:17.570
"Slit your wrists. It'll be
okay. It'll be over."

36:17.670 --> 36:23.270
But it's, like, somebody talking
<i>to</i> me, not in my own brain.

36:23.370 --> 36:24.540
Now it makes sense.

36:24.610 --> 36:26.040
Yeah.

36:26.140 --> 36:28.040
You wanted to kill
the family dog, too.

36:28.150 --> 36:31.180
Yeah. Soon as I opened
the cage to let her out.

36:31.280 --> 36:35.280
The dog knew it wasn't me
because that dog ran from me,

36:35.350 --> 36:37.250
and she don't never run from me.

36:37.350 --> 36:38.550
It's a good thing she did

36:38.660 --> 36:40.690
'cause if I'd have caught her,
I'd have killed her.

36:40.760 --> 36:45.030
I go outside and shake my head,
and I'm like, "Get <i> outta</i> me!"

36:45.130 --> 36:46.630
And it goes away.

36:46.700 --> 36:49.930
The last time it happened,
I punched a hole in the wall.

36:50.030 --> 36:53.500
And I would never
do anything like that.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.440
- Weren't we talkin' about this?
- Yeah.

36:55.540 --> 36:57.040
That we hoped it wasn't him,

36:57.110 --> 36:58.410
and it had somethin'
to do with the house.

36:58.510 --> 37:00.940
- Right.
- You know it's not him.

37:01.050 --> 37:02.440
Yeah.

37:02.510 --> 37:04.510
Now what did this thing
look like?

37:04.620 --> 37:06.350
I had a sketch done.

37:12.220 --> 37:14.760
This looks like somethin'
out of a science fiction movie

37:14.860 --> 37:17.190
or somethin'.

37:17.290 --> 37:19.030
Whoa.

37:23.130 --> 37:24.300
And it grows?

37:24.400 --> 37:26.870
Yes.

37:26.970 --> 37:29.300
A long time ago,

37:29.370 --> 37:31.070
it first started.

37:31.180 --> 37:32.670
Like a seed.

37:32.780 --> 37:35.240
And everything negative
that's happened

37:35.310 --> 37:38.550
over these many, many years
has fed it.

37:38.650 --> 37:42.650
And it's grown bigger and bigger
and bigger and bigger

37:42.750 --> 37:45.450
to this now.

37:45.520 --> 37:48.520
It is like a little animal.

37:48.630 --> 37:50.430
And as an animal,
what do they want?

37:50.530 --> 37:52.190
They want food.

37:52.300 --> 37:54.930
And they wanna be strong,
they wanna survive.

37:55.030 --> 37:58.000
The only way it's gonna do
that is by taking living people.

38:00.570 --> 38:01.670
Going after people

38:01.740 --> 38:05.810
who are vulnerable
that it can absorb.

38:05.910 --> 38:09.380
So this thing, every time
they fight, it gets stronger.

38:09.480 --> 38:10.610
Yes.

38:10.710 --> 38:12.680
Every time Roy has his rage,
it gets stronger.

38:12.780 --> 38:14.380
Yeah.

38:16.290 --> 38:18.590
So if this goes unchecked,

38:18.690 --> 38:20.520
what happens?

38:20.620 --> 38:22.890
Well, I go that
it'll keep growing.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.390
And then eventually,

38:24.500 --> 38:27.460
it would mesh and become
part of the house.

38:27.570 --> 38:30.000
And basically the house
would then be alive,

38:30.100 --> 38:31.400
essentially.

38:31.500 --> 38:33.000
Can anybody live in a house
like that?

38:33.100 --> 38:35.170
No. Mnh-mnh. No.

38:41.880 --> 38:45.210
I was right.

38:45.320 --> 38:48.620
This house
is going to kill me.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.180
Well, Lorie,
I gotta tell you,

39:05.280 --> 39:07.710
you're one of the strongest
people I've ever met.

39:07.810 --> 39:09.480
Amy, listen, I don't wanna put
pressure on you,

39:09.580 --> 39:12.250
but I really hope you can
come up with something for Lorie

39:12.350 --> 39:14.950
so she can live out
her final days in peace.

39:18.630 --> 39:22.390
For years,
this thing has fed

39:22.500 --> 39:24.730
and it has
only grown stronger,

39:24.830 --> 39:27.100
to the point,

39:27.200 --> 39:30.270
that I don't think
any living thing

39:30.370 --> 39:33.440
should be near this thing.

39:33.540 --> 39:35.010
What does this mean?
They gotta move?

39:39.110 --> 39:42.780
The only way that this thing
in this area could be cleansed

39:42.880 --> 39:44.820
is if many mediums,

39:44.920 --> 39:46.550
many holy people

39:46.650 --> 39:50.150
came over months and months

39:50.260 --> 39:53.420
and dedicated
many days, hours,

39:53.530 --> 39:56.460
to eradicating first
the negative dead,

39:56.560 --> 39:59.700
and then attacking this thing
at its source.

40:03.700 --> 40:08.170
The thing of it is,
we leave this thing here,

40:08.270 --> 40:11.610
what's gonna happen?

40:11.710 --> 40:14.880
What I'm honestly hoping

40:14.980 --> 40:17.680
is that this area
will be leveled.

40:23.890 --> 40:25.920
It needs to be leveled.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.460
It's all right, hon.
It's just a house.

40:32.570 --> 40:33.600
Right.

40:33.700 --> 40:35.470
We can get a house.
That's no big deal.

40:40.070 --> 40:41.870
It'll be all right.
It'll be okay.

40:41.970 --> 40:46.210
Well, I guess we better hurry up
'cause I'm not doin' too good.

40:46.310 --> 40:48.350
I know, baby. I know.

40:51.680 --> 40:52.980
Once these guys move,

40:53.090 --> 40:55.550
will she start to feel
a little bit better?

40:55.660 --> 40:57.320
I hope so.

40:57.420 --> 40:59.160
It can't come with me,
can it?

40:59.260 --> 41:00.460
No.

41:00.560 --> 41:01.930
Now will Roy's rage go away
once he's...

41:02.030 --> 41:05.600
Yeah, that'll --
You'll change dramatically.

41:05.700 --> 41:08.270
I hope so.

41:08.370 --> 41:09.670
Listen, you guys
may have lost a home,

41:09.770 --> 41:11.770
but now you got
each other again.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.670
Right?

41:13.770 --> 41:15.540
I know the answers
you were lookin' for

41:15.640 --> 41:17.640
wasn't the ones you got.

41:17.740 --> 41:19.010
No.

41:19.110 --> 41:20.610
But you got answers.

41:20.710 --> 41:22.680
We will be
outta this house quick.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.450
We've had enough.

41:31.960 --> 41:34.730
I wish I had better news
for Lorie and Roy,

41:34.830 --> 41:37.900
but leaving this house
is their best option.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.930
If they do that, things
should improve between them,

41:41.030 --> 41:43.930
and Lorie can live
her remaining days in peace.
