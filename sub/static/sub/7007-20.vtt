WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:07.167
This condominium is part of the estate
of the late Mrs. Wallis Danforth.

00:07.240 --> 00:11.370
Late? Heck, I bet
she doesn't even show up.

00:12.312 --> 00:15.213
Tim, Mrs. Danforth is dead.

00:15.281 --> 00:18.978
Mmm. That would explain
the tardiness then, wouldn't it?

00:19.052 --> 00:21.816
- I guess we'll just go on without her.
- That's right.

00:21.921 --> 00:23.582
- As will Mr. Danforth.
- Tim.

00:23.656 --> 00:26.625
With a swinging bachelor pad,
he's gonna have big parties.

00:26.726 --> 00:29.786
What we'll be doing today
is we're going to take this wall out

00:29.863 --> 00:33.526
so we can increase the flow from the
living room into the dining room area.

00:33.600 --> 00:39.266
But before there's construction,
there's destruction.

00:39.339 --> 00:42.069
And who would know
more about that than you, Tim?

00:42.142 --> 00:44.042
I love destruction.

00:44.110 --> 00:48.240
Before you take out any wall, you want
to make sure that it's non-load bearing.

00:48.314 --> 00:51.010
Simplest way to do that
is check out your blueprints.

00:51.084 --> 00:53.780
This wall is non-load bearing,
so we can rip it out.

00:53.853 --> 00:56.788
And the safest, quickest way,
is using a claw hammer.

00:56.856 --> 01:00.223
And to handle our debris,
we'll be using this trash chute.

01:00.293 --> 01:02.625
It goes directly down
to the dumpster below.

01:02.695 --> 01:07.723
Good thing to remember: One square foot
of wall equals one cubic foot of debris.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.031
Remember that when
reserving a dumpster.

01:10.103 --> 01:13.334
- Thank you "Humpty-Dumpster."
- All right.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.273
Now, we also have these
buckets here for easy cleanup.

01:16.342 --> 01:18.105
Tim, do you have to make such a mess?

01:18.178 --> 01:23.047
No, I don't have to, but I want to.
I really, really, want to.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.284
Next, we'll show you
how to take out a stud.

01:30.623 --> 01:34.115
Just buy me a meal baby.
We'll do the town together.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.822
I don't think so, Tim.

01:39.265 --> 01:44.202
I'm using a reciprocating saw on these
two-by-fours, it doesn't seem to work.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.637
A reason for that, Al, is because
these boards are hard and brittle,

01:47.707 --> 01:49.140
and maybe some knots in them.

01:49.209 --> 01:52.372
That's why I'm going to use
a 30 pound sledge.

01:52.479 --> 01:54.970
Actually, a 20 ounce hammer
would do the same thing.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.346
Where would the fun be in that?

01:57.417 --> 01:58.975
And I got kinda of a clever idea.

01:59.085 --> 02:03.852
In order to get a solid grip on this, I
put some sticky stuff on my gloves.

02:03.923 --> 02:06.653
Same stuff the NFL players
use to grab onto the ball.

02:06.726 --> 02:09.024
Got it from my buddies at the Lions.
Thanks.

02:09.095 --> 02:12.064
Well, that "sticky stuff"
is against NFL rules.

02:12.165 --> 02:17.535
I mean, I got it
from the Chicago Bears.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:28.681 --> 02:30.046
Sorry.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.618
Hey. I know what I'll do next time.

02:32.685 --> 02:36.314
I'll put the sticky stuff on my hands,
put the gloves on top,

02:36.389 --> 02:39.654
then put another coat.
That way I'll get a firm grip.

02:39.726 --> 02:42.194
Always think safety.
I'll do it right now.

02:42.262 --> 02:47.359
Speaking of safety, it's always
a good idea to clean up as you go along.

02:49.869 --> 02:52.804
Tim, this is really heavy.

02:52.872 --> 02:57.036
Let me see it. Oh, wait, get your hands
off of there. All right look at this.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.374
Use your own momentum, Heidi.
Watch this.

02:59.445 --> 03:02.141
Swing it back, and right out the window.
Look at this.

03:57.904 --> 04:01.465
"Genetic Mutations in the Second Half
of the Twentieth Century?"

04:01.574 --> 04:04.065
That's ambitious
for a high school newspaper.

04:04.143 --> 04:07.579
I'm excited about this one,
I've been working on it for two weeks.

04:07.647 --> 04:09.080
Great.

04:09.148 --> 04:14.051
You know, you're commitment to quality
comes from my side of the family.

04:14.821 --> 04:16.379
What makes you say that?

04:16.488 --> 04:18.923
<i>Tool Time.</i>

04:19.291 --> 04:23.058
- Hi, honey. Hey Randy.
- Hey.

04:23.129 --> 04:25.029
Guess what? I have a surprise for you.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.363
- Oh, I love surprises.
- We're being audited.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.459
- I hate surprises.
- Yep.

04:30.536 --> 04:31.628
No.

04:31.704 --> 04:35.231
They want all of your business receipts
from three years ago.

04:35.308 --> 04:36.866
- They do?
- Yeah.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.639
These guys are nosy.
Who do they think they are?

04:39.712 --> 04:43.478
They're the IRS. They can take away your
possessions, your house, cars...

04:43.549 --> 04:47.986
No, no no. I love my country,
but no feds are touching my cars.

04:48.054 --> 04:50.682
How are we set with ammo?

04:50.757 --> 04:52.987
- Find the receipts.
- This will take forever.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.026
I know.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.287
Hey everybody.

04:55.361 --> 04:56.453
Hi guy.

04:56.529 --> 05:00.898
I talked to my college advisor, she said
I need more extracurricular activities.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.561
You can help me and your mom
start our own country.

05:06.439 --> 05:09.966
I talked to the editor of the school
newspaper about writing articles.

05:10.043 --> 05:14.503
- I didn't know you liked writing.
- I didn't think you knew how to write.

05:14.580 --> 05:20.143
Randy, instead of putting your brother
down, you could help him out.

05:20.253 --> 05:24.815
First you want to come up with an idea
you're interested in writing about.

05:24.891 --> 05:26.654
I got something you can write about.

05:26.726 --> 05:30.059
How big government
bullies the little car guy, huh.

05:32.098 --> 05:35.067
- I'll think of the ideas on my own.
- Good luck.

05:35.168 --> 05:39.036
Randy, haven't you learned that luck
has nothing to do with my success?

05:39.105 --> 05:43.269
What success? You live with you parents
and share a bathroom with Mark.

05:43.343 --> 05:47.609
You live in the basement, with no
windows, and a laundry chute.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.615
Yeah. But it's mine.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.310
All mine.

05:54.087 --> 06:00.048
At the end of my article I will
introduce data from the EPA and the DEP.

06:00.660 --> 06:05.825
Now will that data include the number of
people who fall asleep reading the data?

06:05.932 --> 06:11.837
I thought you'd take more interest in
mutation, seeing as how you are one.

06:11.904 --> 06:15.067
Randy, don't stoop to his level.
Let me.

06:15.141 --> 06:17.507
You're a geek.

06:18.044 --> 06:23.004
Hey everybody. Sorry I'm late, I got my
hand stuck in the soda machine.

06:23.082 --> 06:26.745
Well, since you're the brother of our
top reporter, we'll go easy on you.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.185
Everybody, listen up.
This is Brad Taylor.

06:29.288 --> 06:31.756
- Hi Brad.
- Hey.

06:31.824 --> 06:33.689
Have you thought about your article?

06:33.760 --> 06:36.661
Yeah. I wanna do something
on sports and stuff.

06:36.729 --> 06:40.995
<i>That'd be great if our paper
were called News and Junk.</i>

06:41.067 --> 06:43.160
What specifically did you have in mind?

06:43.236 --> 06:46.399
Articles on Lakeside High sports,
like the locker room buzz.

06:46.472 --> 06:51.205
We can get workout tips from our
athletes, and ask them questions like...

06:51.277 --> 06:54.940
"Hey yo, so what do you
look for in a babe?"

06:55.014 --> 06:56.982
So that's my idea.

06:57.083 --> 07:01.110
- And it sounds really cool.
- It has some promise.

07:01.187 --> 07:05.283
Matt, I can work with Brad, and help him
come up with something more substantial.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.588
Why don't we let Brad run with his idea?

07:07.660 --> 07:11.221
Brad, have your article in by Friday,
and we'll see what you come up with.

07:11.297 --> 07:14.357
- OK?
- All right, cool, thanks.

07:15.768 --> 07:19.534
Hey, yo. So, did you ever think I'd be
working with you on this newspaper?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.732
Hey, no.

07:23.509 --> 07:26.239
Tim, do you have
those receipts we talked about?

07:26.312 --> 07:30.681
Got them right here,
all categorized and alphabetized.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.217
Next time, I'm not letting
the government off so easy.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.257
I'm gonna claim all seven dependents.

07:38.324 --> 07:42.283
- Seven?
- Three boys, four cars.

07:42.361 --> 07:44.921
You can't
count the cars as dependents.

07:44.997 --> 07:48.262
Why not? I buy them things,
I feed them, I bathe them.

07:49.602 --> 07:52.264
Guess what?
They loved my idea for the paper.

07:52.338 --> 07:54.363
- Hey, good for you.
- Congratulations.

07:54.440 --> 07:58.536
Hey, you and Randy are going to be
the next Woodward and Bernstein.

07:58.611 --> 08:00.374
Excuse me?

08:00.446 --> 08:03.347
I think Joanne Woodward
married Paul Newman.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.847
Is that the spaghetti sauce guy?

08:08.087 --> 08:12.114
Not only does he make spaghetti sauce,
but salad dressing and popcorn,

08:12.191 --> 08:15.524
and, the dude races cars.

08:15.595 --> 08:18.428
Now that's a talented guy.

08:19.065 --> 08:23.695
This is a bill for when you shorted the
circuits, how is that an expense?

08:24.670 --> 08:27.969
'Cause I put out the fire
with a Binford fire extinguisher.

08:29.609 --> 08:31.372
- Hey guys.
- Hello Randy.

08:31.477 --> 08:34.640
We heard Brad's going to be
working on the paper with you?

08:34.714 --> 08:36.841
The editor's going to let him write.

08:36.916 --> 08:40.977
But now the real work begins, he's
gotta have his article in by Friday.

08:41.053 --> 08:43.283
All right. See you guys,
I'm going to the mall.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.586
Shouldrt you start
writing your article?

08:45.658 --> 08:50.527
<i>I've already done it. I did it during
Spanish class, it's muy bueno.</i>

08:51.797 --> 08:54.288
You wrote an entire article
in 45 minutes?

08:54.367 --> 08:55.994
<i>Si Señor.</i>

08:56.702 --> 08:57.999
<i>Adios.</i>

08:58.070 --> 09:01.631
Hey Brad, do you mind
if we look at the article?

09:01.741 --> 09:04.835
- No, go ahead.
- OK.

09:05.778 --> 09:09.305
- Thanks. See ya.
- All right. I'll be home before dinner.

09:12.919 --> 09:15.285
"Hey Yo.

09:16.122 --> 09:17.214
By Brad Taylor."

09:17.290 --> 09:18.655
I like the title.

09:19.225 --> 09:23.059
"A locker room survey shows
that our baseball team prefers

09:23.129 --> 09:25.029
boxers to briefs eight to one.

09:26.232 --> 09:30.794
The one wearing the tightie whities
declined to comment."

09:30.870 --> 09:34.033
That's probably because the strap
was cutting his breath off.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.140
This is pure fluff.

09:37.243 --> 09:43.079
"Tennis team's Drew Levin is now dating
his doubles partner Debbie Silverman."

09:43.149 --> 09:45.674
Way to go, Drew.

09:46.452 --> 09:48.545
Mom, they'll never
put this in the paper.

09:48.621 --> 09:53.251
Look, it's not a hard-hitting exposé,
but I bet the kids will find it fun.

09:53.326 --> 09:57.820
If every paper had reporting like this,
we'd have a nation filled with idiots.

09:57.897 --> 10:00.457
This is great.

10:04.470 --> 10:05.437
- Hey Randy.
- Hey.

10:05.538 --> 10:08.701
This weeks paper is out.
That was a really great article.

10:08.808 --> 10:13.643
Thanks, there was more I wanted to say,
but I didn't want to hog the front page.

10:13.713 --> 10:17.877
Um, technically,
you're not on the front page.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.947
Technically, where am I?

10:20.052 --> 10:22.543
You know, I don't think
that's really important.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.386
What matters is that
you got your message across.

10:25.458 --> 10:30.157
My message is on the page
with next weeks lunch menu.

10:30.229 --> 10:33.323
I'm buried under Salisbury steak.

10:33.399 --> 10:35.094
Randy, it's not that big a deal.

10:35.167 --> 10:40.400
It is to me. What could be so important
that it bumps me off the front page.

10:40.473 --> 10:44.375
"Hey yo, look who's got
a remedy for jock itch?"

10:45.077 --> 10:49.446
- Great article.
- Ah, Gracias.

10:54.120 --> 10:58.056
Randy, I'm sending the paper to everyone
I know, what class I should send it?

10:58.124 --> 11:00.490
How 'bout low class?

11:01.594 --> 11:03.619
Whoa, I sense some hostility.

11:03.696 --> 11:05.823
And why would that be, Brad?

11:05.898 --> 11:08.765
Could it be because I spent two weeks
writing my article,

11:08.834 --> 11:11.860
to have it bumped off the front
page with your mindless drivel?

11:11.937 --> 11:14.838
Maybe yours got bumped off
because mine was better.

11:14.907 --> 11:19.970
Let's see. Ecosystem on the verge
of collapse, or rash in the groin area.

11:20.046 --> 11:21.911
- Hi Guys.
- Know what your problem is?

11:21.981 --> 11:25.849
- You're jealous of me.
- Please, what would I be jealous about?

11:25.918 --> 11:29.410
That people like my article better,
or maybe people just like me better.

11:29.488 --> 11:30.455
- Brad.
- Jill.

11:30.556 --> 11:34.083
I'm more popular, more athletic,
and it looks like I'm a better writer.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.685
You are such a deluded egomaniac.

11:36.762 --> 11:40.528
You're the one that's deluded. You think
people want to read your boring crap.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.329
- Knock it off!
- Guys, guys, guys, stop!

11:43.402 --> 11:44.767
What is the problem here?

11:44.870 --> 11:49.637
<i>The problem is your older should be
writing an article called Hey Duh.</i>

11:52.712 --> 11:55.237
Hey, I'm taller than you too!

11:56.515 --> 11:59.006
Good comeback, Brad.

12:00.619 --> 12:05.249
Oh well. It's good to know they're both
getting along real well at the paper.

12:05.324 --> 12:07.884
<i>Well, look. Hey Yo is on the front page.</i>

12:07.993 --> 12:09.654
Oh, Great.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.061
Randy's article
is way back here by the...

12:13.365 --> 12:16.801
Look, they make Salisbury steak
the same way I do.

12:18.337 --> 12:22.501
Oh man, Randy must just
feel awful about this.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.635
Why? Because his mom
cooks like a cafeteria lady?

12:27.213 --> 12:31.547
Brad stole the spotlight,
we're going to have to help them out.

12:31.617 --> 12:33.585
Honey, no. I grew up with four brothers.

12:33.686 --> 12:36.655
The last thing these two need
is their parents interfering.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.520
I know it's better to let them
work this out on their own,

12:39.625 --> 12:43.152
but I'm their mommy,
and they're being so mean to each other.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.527
- Their mommy?
- Well.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.862
- Do you think they'll work this out.
- Yes, yes.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.369
My brothers and I fought all the time,
we always worked through it.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.132
And after the cast came off

12:53.205 --> 12:56.697
and Jeff got used to his glass eye,
we were best friends.

13:01.113 --> 13:05.174
Of all the people that they could have
audited, why'd they pick us?

13:05.251 --> 13:08.516
Seems pretty obvious they
go after the major celebrities.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.250
Mind if I put Brad's article
up on the refrigerator?

13:12.324 --> 13:15.088
No, I think that's so sweet
that you're so proud of him.

13:15.194 --> 13:18.755
Actually, I'm doing it to annoy Randy.

13:18.864 --> 13:22.698
See, the more they fight,
the less they rag on me.

13:23.335 --> 13:25.826
You guys know where Randy is?
I need to talk to him.

13:25.905 --> 13:27.805
Talking is good. That's a good idea.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.201
Hey idiot. Why didn't you tell me
Samantha called?

13:31.277 --> 13:36.146
Oh, well I'd figured she'd call you back
seeing as how you're popular and tall.

13:36.682 --> 13:39.708
It doesn't get any better than this.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.115
Shut up!

13:44.190 --> 13:46.681
You know what my next
article's gonna be?

13:46.759 --> 13:49.284
<i>Hey Yo, guess who beat the crap
out of his brother.</i>

13:49.361 --> 13:53.127
<i>I have a new title. Guess who beat
the crap his pea-brain brother.</i>

13:53.199 --> 13:55.759
- So what are you trying to say?
- Tim, do something.

13:55.835 --> 13:59.396
I'll handle this.
Boys! Take it outside.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.700
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

14:04.376 --> 14:07.277
Look, you go talk to one of them,
I'll talk to the other.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.110
Let them take care of this themselves.

14:12.651 --> 14:15.552
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm underreacting.

14:16.956 --> 14:19.447
Guys, guys, guys. Come on.
Split up. Come on.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.685
Come on. Come on, guys.

14:20.759 --> 14:23.455
Stay out here, I want to talk to you,
all right?

14:25.731 --> 14:29.189
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:29.268 --> 14:31.759
Look, I want to tell you a story
about when I was 14.

14:31.837 --> 14:37.332
- Oh God, not the flute story again.
- It's not the flute story, OK.

14:37.409 --> 14:42.472
Now, this is a story about my mother.
She bought me my very first tuba.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.072
Oh, this is the flute story!

14:44.149 --> 14:45.514
It's a good story.

14:45.584 --> 14:47.882
I know, but I can't
sit through it again.

14:47.953 --> 14:50.217
You know how much I hate it
when you guys fight.

14:50.289 --> 14:54.919
Then you should be telling
your flute story to Mr Hey Yo Yo.

14:54.994 --> 14:58.088
I wouldn't interfere if you guys
worked this out.

14:58.163 --> 14:59.858
What's the big deal if we don't?

14:59.932 --> 15:02.867
The big deal is that Brad's
going away to college in a year.

15:02.935 --> 15:04.698
And you only have so much time left,

15:04.803 --> 15:08.239
that you could hang out together,
you should take advantage.

15:08.307 --> 15:11.140
That would work, if we could stand
the sight of each other.

15:11.210 --> 15:13.974
I don't believe that's true,
I don't think you do either.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.241
I do.

15:16.315 --> 15:19.443
- What's going on with you?
- I don't want to talk about it.

15:19.518 --> 15:21.349
Look, all brothers fight, OK.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.355
When I was a kid,
I got in a fight with Uncle Steve.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.584
I borrowed his 56 Chevy
without permission.

15:26.692 --> 15:29.661
- Dad, what's your point?
- I drove it into Corton Lake.

15:29.728 --> 15:33.255
Oh man, I bet when Uncle Steve
beat you up, it hurt.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.698
He roughed me up a little bit.

15:35.801 --> 15:40.363
This fight put a big distance between
us, it really hurt our relationship.

15:40.472 --> 15:43.908
Well, Uncle Steve's a lot bigger.
I mean he's got those huge arms.

15:43.976 --> 15:48.538
What I'm saying is, this fight can hurt
your relationship with your brother.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.913
Well yeah, I bet Uncle Steve
whooped your butt.

15:52.551 --> 15:54.416
He didn't whoop my butt.

15:54.486 --> 15:57.649
As a matter of fact, if he were here
right now, I'd whoop his butt.

15:57.723 --> 16:01.056
He's bigger and softer now.
I'd grab Mr Porkbelly by the flab and go

16:01.126 --> 16:03.822
Who's the kid now, huh?!

16:03.896 --> 16:05.022
Dad.
Dad!

16:05.097 --> 16:07.861
- In a minute. I tell you...
- Dad!

16:07.967 --> 16:08.934
What?!

16:09.034 --> 16:10.729
I know what you're trying to say.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.897
But if you think I'm gonna
talk to Randy, you can forget it,

16:15.641 --> 16:20.078
I would hate to think a newspaper
article would come between you.

16:20.145 --> 16:23.308
Yeah, well why don't you
go tell that to Mutant Boy.

16:23.382 --> 16:25.350
And I don't like you calling him names.

16:26.085 --> 16:29.179
You just called Uncle Steve
Mr Porkbelly.

16:29.254 --> 16:33.020
Well, that's a term of affection,
you know, because I like bacon.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.858
- Well hidy-ho, Taylor-teen.
- Oh hey, Wilson.

16:40.966 --> 16:43.992
Shouldrt you put those newspapers
in the recycling bin?

16:44.069 --> 16:48.699
<i>Nah, thanks to Hey Yo,
this paper is definitely trash.</i>

16:48.774 --> 16:51.868
Oh, I take it you didn't
like Brad's article.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.206
Did you read it?

16:53.278 --> 16:55.803
Yes, he gave a copy of it to me
a few moments ago.

16:56.415 --> 16:58.713
I'm surprised he didn't
frame it for you.

16:58.784 --> 17:01.150
Well actually, he did.

17:04.189 --> 17:08.887
I've worked two years at that paper
trying to produce quality journalism.

17:08.961 --> 17:12.192
Then Brad waltzes in
and steals your thunder.

17:12.263 --> 17:16.633
It's not so much that he stole my
thunder, it's what he stole it with.

17:16.734 --> 17:18.430
Jock itch.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.403
You got it.

17:20.506 --> 17:23.339
Randy, let me
ask you something.

17:23.409 --> 17:28.039
If Brad had written a brilliant article,
would you feel any differently?

17:29.014 --> 17:32.313
I might be a bit jealous, but at least
I would've respected it.

17:32.384 --> 17:38.084
Despite what anyone may think of Brad's
article, it doesn't diminish yours.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.717
You know, Robert Kennedy once said:

17:40.826 --> 17:46.765
<i>Each time a man stands up for an ideal,
he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope.</i>

17:47.433 --> 17:51.267
I'd like to believe that, but how do I
keep pouring my heart into my writing

17:51.336 --> 17:54.828
if people are more interested
in who's scratching where.

17:55.974 --> 17:59.466
You know Randy, once I was a young
columnist for the Wichita Star,

17:59.545 --> 18:04.710
then I got bumped from my feature column
by this hot-shot named Walter Winchell.

18:04.783 --> 18:06.683
- Walter Winchell?
- The God of Gossip,

18:06.752 --> 18:09.118
The Earl of Innuendo,
The Duke of...

18:09.221 --> 18:11.348
- Wilson, I get it.
- No, I've got one more.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.358
The Baron of Baloney.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.688
What were you gonna say?

18:15.761 --> 18:20.061
I was so outraged by being
upstaged by Winchell, I wanted to quit.

18:20.132 --> 18:25.900
And then suddenly, I realized, if more
people buy the paper to read Winchell,

18:25.971 --> 18:27.871
more people are gonna read mine.

18:28.407 --> 18:31.638
<i>So maybe Hey Yo can do for me
what Winchell did for you?</i>

18:31.710 --> 18:33.007
Absolutely.

18:33.078 --> 18:38.516
<i>Because of him, the readership doubled
for my column, Rock Beat.</i>

18:38.584 --> 18:41.917
- You wrote about Rock and Roll?
- No, no, no, no, no. Rocks.

18:45.224 --> 18:47.658
Here's your research, Brad.

18:47.726 --> 18:51.958
Cheerleader Jenny Morrison
is doing some major padding.

18:53.765 --> 18:59.067
A baton twirler has actually
seen Jenny wad the tissues.

19:00.973 --> 19:04.033
- Nah, I'm not gonna print that.
- Why not?

19:04.109 --> 19:06.873
<i>Because this is Hey Yo,
I have standards.</i>

19:09.081 --> 19:12.608
Brad, you printed the names of the guys
who don't shower after gym class.

19:12.684 --> 19:15.653
Yeah, you're just mad
because your name was on the list.

19:20.559 --> 19:22.117
Hey Brad?

19:22.227 --> 19:24.695
Yeah, if you need the computer,
I'm almost off.

19:24.763 --> 19:27.323
Nah, it's all right.

19:27.399 --> 19:31.165
- Listen, I wanted to talk to you.
- About what?

19:31.870 --> 19:34.168
Well, I just re-read your article,

19:34.239 --> 19:37.402
and I took some shots
at it that werert fair.

19:39.278 --> 19:40.438
And you liked it?

19:41.547 --> 19:44.107
Well, I thought there was
some good things in it.

19:44.216 --> 19:47.379
You know, I didn't know
our mascot was allergic to cats.

19:49.254 --> 19:50.278
Thanks.

19:50.355 --> 19:53.518
You know, you're kinda like
a modern day Walter Winchell.

19:54.159 --> 19:55.922
The donut guy?

20:02.834 --> 20:03.801
OK.

20:06.605 --> 20:09.540
So, what are you planning
on writing about next?

20:09.608 --> 20:13.738
I haven't really thought about it.
Still coming down from my last article.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.712
Yeah, it was pretty intense.

20:15.781 --> 20:17.510
You actually read it?

20:17.583 --> 20:21.849
Yeah, I read it. I didn't really
understand what I was reading, but,

20:21.920 --> 20:24.616
I can definitely tell
you are a talented writer.

20:24.690 --> 20:25.952
Thanks.

20:26.024 --> 20:30.120
Maybe one day we can combine our talents
and write something together.

20:30.195 --> 20:34.291
<i>Hey Yo, did you see what Ralph Nader
wore to the latest EPA conference?</i>

20:34.766 --> 20:37.792
Well if he's got jock itch,
we've got a story.

20:41.940 --> 20:44.204
This auditor is in for a big surprise.

20:44.276 --> 20:49.771
After adding together all the receipts,
we overpayed, we're getting a refund.

20:49.848 --> 20:51.372
Hello speedboat.

20:51.450 --> 20:55.716
Uh, three dollars and seventeen cents.

20:56.755 --> 20:59.781
- Hello sunblock.
- Yeah.

20:59.858 --> 21:02.383
You know, as long as we're
in this tax mode,

21:02.461 --> 21:06.329
I think we should finish this years
taxes, and mail them in early.

21:06.398 --> 21:08.696
Why would we want to do that?

21:08.767 --> 21:13.704
Because, every year we wait until five
minutes before midnight on April 15th,

21:13.772 --> 21:17.606
and then you get in the car and drive
150 miles an hour, your heart pounding,

21:17.676 --> 21:20.008
your face drenched with sweat.

21:20.178 --> 21:22.874
Please don't take that away from me.

21:25.884 --> 21:29.012
Welcome back to Tool Time on location.

21:29.087 --> 21:32.853
Thank you, Heidi.
We're back on

21:32.958 --> 21:37.258
Well I'm using a reciprocating saw
on these two by fours but it does...

21:37.329 --> 21:39.422
You all right there, Heidi?

21:39.498 --> 21:43.958
I talked to my college advisor, she said
I need more extracurricular activities.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.266
You can start
by helping your mom and me...

21:48.907 --> 21:51.000
Well, I have a new article
for your title.

21:51.076 --> 21:54.568
No I don't,
I have a new title for your article.

21:54.646 --> 21:58.013
You're overreacting,
let them deal with it themselves.
