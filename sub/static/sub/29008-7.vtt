WEBVTT

00:11.920 --> 00:13.280
-Yes?
-"Inspector.

00:13.720 --> 00:17.480
It’s Suárez. We’ve found something
in the CCTV footage of the museum.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.920
-It’s important."
-I’m on my way.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.760
SUNDAY
8:35 AM

00:35.400 --> 00:36.800
-Here you are.
-Thanks, Ángel.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.800
We’ve reviewed the hard disk
of the surveillance cameras...

00:39.880 --> 00:41.520
Listen, listen, Raquel,

00:42.480 --> 00:44.560
I’d like to apologize for last night.

00:45.040 --> 00:48.360
I hadn’t slept for 48 hours,
I had a few too many glasses of wine.

00:48.440 --> 00:51.400
-I don’t want you to think...
-Ángel, don’t worry.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.040
It’s fine, okay?

00:53.280 --> 00:55.560
46 HOURS OF ROBBERY

00:56.640 --> 00:59.040
Look, Suárez has found
a break in the case.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.560
It’s the surveillance footage of the day
Aníbal Cortés y Silene Oliveira

01:02.720 --> 01:03.600
"visited the museum."

01:04.400 --> 01:07.240
-Look closely at the items they put
on the tray at the entrance.

01:11.480 --> 01:12.960
Zoom in as much as you can.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.600
There, stop. Enlarge it.

01:19.840 --> 01:20.880
Those are car keys.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.320
"Of a Seat, an old one,
in the original key holder.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.400
Presumably between 1989 and 1996.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.640
We have the date
and the time they entered,"

01:31.760 --> 01:33.800
and the car model which they drove.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.960
We’ll canvass the area. Security cameras,

01:37.040 --> 01:39.200
car parks, shops, banks,

01:39.280 --> 01:41.600
"car park tickets from regulated
parking areas, everything."

01:41.960 --> 01:42.840
Rule out.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.040
"The other file, scroll up.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.080
We have to find that car at any cost.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.960
Go through it. Good. We’ve got it."

01:52.920 --> 01:54.280
It’s an Ibiza from 1992.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.040
"Great."

01:59.120 --> 02:02.240
Those keys and that car
will take us where it all began.

02:05.760 --> 02:07.760
-Shut up.
-Here are the car keys.

02:08.480 --> 02:10.880
Nairobi and Rio get changed
to go to the museum.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.320
Me? Really?

02:13.480 --> 02:14.880
-You.
-To the city?

02:16.280 --> 02:19.400
But, don’t send me with that kid,
send me with a real man,

02:19.560 --> 02:22.360
with Helsinki.
Why don’t you send me with Helsinki?

02:22.800 --> 02:24.840
Yes, Helsinki prefers
the hairy chest type.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.400
Wasn’t you and I who were going?

02:31.480 --> 02:34.480
Check the CCTV cameras against
the sketch from my previous visit.

02:34.560 --> 02:38.360
We need to confirm the location,
the angles and the objectives.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.760
Come on, change your clothes.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.840
Helsinki, a queer.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.880
My goodness! But you like men.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.400
War, prison...

03:02.080 --> 03:03.440
I see, I see. Women, no.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.160
You don’t like them, do you?

03:06.280 --> 03:08.840
-Wasn’t it me who was going with Rio?
-I’ve changed my mind.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.240
Have you? What’s happened?

03:11.120 --> 03:13.120
Nothing, I’ve changed my mind and period.

03:16.600 --> 03:17.640
What’s happened?

03:18.400 --> 03:19.960
So, you don’t trust me or what?

03:20.520 --> 03:23.600
Have I done anything?
What the heck have I done?

03:30.120 --> 03:31.440
I haven’t done anything, have I?

03:33.680 --> 03:34.560
It’s not that.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.400
No.

03:39.240 --> 03:40.520
Did anything happened?

03:48.360 --> 03:49.240
My mother?

03:55.440 --> 03:57.080
A heart attack, I’m very sorry.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.680
-When?
-Yesterday.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.080
I’ve decided
that you won’t go to the museum

04:05.160 --> 04:08.200
to avoid you from being tempted
to go and say your last goodbye.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.920
I’ll stay with her. Someone else can go.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.400
I don’t need to say goodbye.

04:16.960 --> 04:17.960
I already did it.

04:21.120 --> 04:24.120
The last time we talked
she wanted to turn me over to the police,

04:24.600 --> 04:26.280
so that woman was no longer my mother.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.400
Professor.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.200
tell me what I have to do with Berlin.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.320
Shall I throw him to the dogs
or shall I shoot him dead?

05:55.400 --> 05:56.280
"You’re the boss."

05:56.360 --> 05:58.840
I’ll take care of that.
Pass me on to Helsinki.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.280
-It won’t be the police?
-Come on, here you are.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.160
-"Helsinki."
-Yes?

06:11.440 --> 06:15.520
The photograph you gave me of the cube
of scrap is of the Ibiza, isn’t it?

06:16.280 --> 06:18.720
I’m saying this
because I’m looking at it closely and...

06:18.920 --> 06:23.160
it looks to me that the colour
of the paint it’s not exactly the same.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.520
Me leave car in the wreck yard.

06:27.160 --> 06:30.400
Helsinki, the photograph you gave me
is it of the Ibiza?

06:32.160 --> 06:33.040
No.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.120
"Other car,"

06:35.360 --> 06:37.080
but they said:

06:38.360 --> 06:41.240
-"It would look like that."
-I gave you 1000 euros,

06:41.760 --> 06:43.440
1000 euros to pay them

06:43.960 --> 06:46.360
and they would turn the car into scrap
before your eyes.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.040
What did you do, did you keep
the stinking 1000 euros

06:49.120 --> 06:51.520
when we were going to do
a 2000 million heist?

06:51.680 --> 06:54.360
2000 million, flying money...

06:56.160 --> 06:59.000
and 1000 euros, money in my pocket.

06:59.480 --> 07:02.480
"Me locked up, no work,
five months in Toledo...."

07:03.320 --> 07:04.200
and family...

07:04.600 --> 07:06.560
Me send all the money to my family.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.240
If for you 1000 euros, not important,

07:11.400 --> 07:12.520
for me very important.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.280
Important, Helsinki.
That car is a loose end

07:16.040 --> 07:18.560
and from that end they can start pulling,
and find something.

07:18.720 --> 07:21.120
We inside here leave many loose ends,

07:21.280 --> 07:22.760
"you outside there only one".

07:24.120 --> 07:25.040
All right.

07:25.640 --> 07:29.080
Tell me, at least, if they didn’t
turn the car into scrap in front of you,

07:29.200 --> 07:30.720
you wiped the fingerprints off.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.320
Yes. Yes.

07:34.840 --> 07:39.520
-Helsinki, what are fingerprints?
-Fingerprints. Yes, Professor, yes.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.560
-What does “fingerprints” mean?
-No... I don’t know.

07:44.040 --> 07:47.120
"Did you clean the steering wheel
with ammonia, the gear shaft,"

07:47.200 --> 07:49.600
the windows, the dashboard,
the whole bloody car?

07:49.920 --> 07:50.800
Yes.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.800
No. This I didn’t do.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.080
Pass me on to the kidnapper.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.200
Sleeping does you a lot of good. You’re
starting really fast up this morning.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.920
Thieves are caught by chasing them,
and we’re too passive.

08:20.720 --> 08:21.760
Where is my pencil?

08:25.480 --> 08:27.400
Let’s tighten the screws on them.

08:52.640 --> 08:53.760
"Good morning, Professor."

08:54.920 --> 08:57.160
How is Mr. Roman after his surgery?

08:57.920 --> 08:58.800
Well.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.800
Resting and, the best of all,
no high temperature.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.640
"I thought you’d forgotten me, Inspector.

09:05.160 --> 09:08.360
Quite the opposite,
actually I think of you all the time.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.680
I see, that sounds like a fantasy.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.880
We should keep exploring that path.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.480
If you’re going to ask me,
what I had for breakfast,

09:16.560 --> 09:18.240
if I had a morning orgasm

09:18.400 --> 09:21.920
"or I like foreplay,
I’ll tell you it isn’t about that,"

09:22.080 --> 09:25.440
but yes, it’s a fantasy,
a fantasy with handcuffs in it.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.960
I put them on you
and I take you to the police van.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.120
Well, it’s a fantasy after all.

09:32.120 --> 09:36.240
Surely, later on if you want,
you tell me yours during a conjugal visit.

09:37.080 --> 09:39.800
"Listen to me carefully:
I’m going to break the news to you."

09:40.480 --> 09:43.600
Firstly, the ship you were asking for,
the Malaika,

09:43.680 --> 09:45.320
is at the port awaiting trial,

09:45.880 --> 09:48.040
so it still belongs to the ship owner.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.440
That’s no excuse, Inspector.
The police can request authorization

09:52.520 --> 09:56.120
from the judge to use that ship
in the pursuit of an act of crime

09:56.280 --> 09:59.880
"as long as,
the sentence hasn’t been passed,"

10:00.560 --> 10:02.720
so you can a ask for permission to use it,

10:02.800 --> 10:04.880
especially in this matter
of such relevance.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.400
Don’t tell me you haven’t done it.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.320
I can see you also know about laws.

10:10.480 --> 10:12.360
Well, just an amateur.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.960
I enjoy reading judicial sentences.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.920
"You’d be surprised
how fascinating it can be."

10:19.280 --> 10:22.560
All right, I’ll bare it in mind
now that I’ll have time for it.

10:23.760 --> 10:25.240
I will be released from the case.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.240
"We’re at a dead end."

10:29.480 --> 10:32.480
Too many hours have passed
and, as you’ll understand,

10:33.160 --> 10:35.000
my superiors can’t wait any longer.

10:36.040 --> 10:39.720
If you really want to negotiate with me,
release eight hostages.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.880
Eight hostages,
and they have to be underage people.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.240
Why should I do that?

10:55.640 --> 10:58.280
Because it’s your turn
to show me a gesture of goodwill.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.280
If you want to have some credit,
free those hostages.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.080
If not, they’ll assign another inspector
to the case,

11:04.160 --> 11:06.520
"someone with a different approach
and different objectives."

11:06.680 --> 11:09.440
I’ll give you an hour to think it over,
not a minute longer.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.840
That man doesn’t want the Malaika.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.360
Why do you say that?

11:25.520 --> 11:28.360
Why ask for a ship
that it’ll take him five days to get

11:28.440 --> 11:31.640
-if he can have any other?
-To see who has a longer dick?

11:32.120 --> 11:35.560
Inspector, I don’t know why, but get them
that ship and get them out of there.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.560
He’s idea is to exit from somewhere else.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.320
-Ángel.
-Tell me.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.280
Tell the Underground Unit
to canvass the sewerage system

11:47.360 --> 11:49.000
within 500 metres.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.920
Old tunnels, drains, any whole.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.400
-Okay.
-Come on, start working!

13:19.160 --> 13:21.040
Hey! You!

13:22.800 --> 13:24.680
-Listen!
-I finally find you!

13:24.840 --> 13:27.040
I was trying to go to the main entrance.

14:47.960 --> 14:48.880
Let me down!

14:54.160 --> 14:57.000
Please, let me down! Please!

14:59.320 --> 15:01.880
No! No! Please!

15:02.400 --> 15:03.800
Let me down! Please!

15:04.240 --> 15:05.400
I’m in the boot!

15:13.720 --> 15:14.600
"Salva.

15:15.720 --> 15:18.360
-Salva?"
-Yes, hello.

15:18.520 --> 15:22.720
Salva, it’s Raquel.
No nothing, I’m here at the Hanoi...

15:22.880 --> 15:26.520
"having a drink
and, well, as... I can’t see you around"

15:26.680 --> 15:29.880
and it’s become quite usual
bumping into each other here,

15:30.040 --> 15:33.520
I thought that you may fancy a coffee

15:33.960 --> 15:36.040
-or have a break...
-"Well, I’d..."

15:36.200 --> 15:39.520
love to, but the thing is
I’m not in Madrid right now.

15:41.520 --> 15:44.400
-Salva, are you okay?
-No, sorry, the thing is

15:44.560 --> 15:47.360
as I’m not focusing on my driving,
a lorry almost crashed into me!

15:47.520 --> 15:49.960
Anyway, sorry,
I won’t interrupt you any longer.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.760
"No problem, I’ll see you around.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.880
And If you get back early and fancy
having something to eat today...

16:00.360 --> 16:02.040
Sorry, Salva, what...."

16:02.120 --> 16:05.640
The thing is, yesterday
I told my mother about you and...

16:06.440 --> 16:08.920
the woman is a bit hippy
and eccentric, and...

16:09.000 --> 16:11.680
you see, she goes and says,
out of nowhere,

16:11.760 --> 16:14.480
that perhaps I should
brighten up my life a little

16:14.560 --> 16:18.240
and we should get to know each other more,
nibble. Don’t misunderstand me, will you?

16:18.720 --> 16:21.800
Nibble... She meant
have a bit more social life,

16:21.880 --> 16:25.000
-that’s why I told you about having lunch.
-Okay.

16:25.200 --> 16:28.160
What...? What, yes? Ah, it sounds great!

16:28.800 --> 16:30.600
-"Dinner, better?"
-Perfect!

16:31.120 --> 16:33.320
-It sounds great.
-Okay, fantastic then.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.320
-See you later, then.
-Bye, ciao!

16:36.480 --> 16:37.680
Ciao, see you later!

16:44.240 --> 16:45.240
Please!

16:46.120 --> 16:47.120
Let me down!

16:48.760 --> 16:50.640
Let me down!

17:17.720 --> 17:18.800
You don’t smoke?

17:23.080 --> 17:24.640
Fine, fine.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.280
It won’t be me the one
to harm your health.

17:36.360 --> 17:37.760
You are okay here, aren’t you?

17:40.240 --> 17:41.240
All together.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.320
Not sensing the horror,

17:48.400 --> 17:49.480
the shooting,

17:51.880 --> 17:54.640
the blood, the surgery...

17:56.880 --> 17:58.320
I must come more often.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.480
It’s difficult out there.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.040
Last night...

18:11.600 --> 18:12.840
I phoned a friend.

18:16.840 --> 18:20.720
I told him how difficult it is
to maintain order and harmony in here.

18:22.880 --> 18:25.840
I told him... that I had to kill,

18:29.920 --> 18:31.520
that I gave the order to kill...

18:33.160 --> 18:34.160
a woman.

18:36.640 --> 18:40.720
If you don’t put the dead bodies on
the table, you’re not respected out there.

18:42.320 --> 18:43.480
And, you see, I...

18:46.960 --> 18:50.320
could feel... the emotion in my friend,

18:53.920 --> 18:55.560
his distress,

18:57.200 --> 18:58.440
his breathing,

18:59.720 --> 19:01.000
his panting

19:03.120 --> 19:04.400
and his grief.

19:06.920 --> 19:07.920
He...

19:11.320 --> 19:15.600
He wasn’t here,
he hadn’t met that woman either,

19:16.240 --> 19:17.720
Mónica Gaztambide,

19:20.640 --> 19:22.080
and for a moment...

19:30.440 --> 19:33.680
For a moment, I though
it would be great to feel

19:34.960 --> 19:36.360
what my friend feels.

19:40.400 --> 19:44.880
Feel that... kind of emotion, that grief,

19:47.240 --> 19:49.640
that remorse, but not...

19:52.360 --> 19:53.760
I couldn’t be moved.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.680
How dreadful, isn’t it?

20:06.160 --> 20:09.440
I’m bothering you with my nonsense,
you’ll have to excuse me.

20:09.520 --> 20:10.520
Silvia.

20:13.800 --> 20:14.800
Silvia.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.400
You’re having an anxiety attack,
aren’t you?

20:21.160 --> 20:22.800
She’s only a bit nervous,

20:23.560 --> 20:25.200
but it’ll go away soon.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Sure.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.720
I’m sure it will.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.520
Come with me.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.120
Silvia, give me your hand.

20:45.960 --> 20:46.960
That’s good.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.520
No... No...

21:22.080 --> 21:25.720
"Spasiba."
I came in because in the car, here

21:25.840 --> 21:29.800
and forgot something very important
in the boot, very important.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.960
Very important. Very important.

21:32.120 --> 21:35.280
You jump the fence. Now, you tell police.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.400
We can come to an agreement with money.

21:39.560 --> 21:40.720
How much money?

21:40.880 --> 21:43.680
A lot. Look.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.640
I have a lot of money.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.040
That’s not a lot of money.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.720
For God’s sake I don’t have any more.
Look in my wallet.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.480
Me count to five and let dog loose.

22:00.760 --> 22:01.640
Do you understand?

22:26.240 --> 22:28.440
-What are you doing?
-I’m mounting the cells

22:28.520 --> 22:30.800
to put the explosives in the entry ways.

22:32.320 --> 22:33.800
Did Berlin ask you to do it?

22:34.800 --> 22:39.480
The Professor, a deterrent,
so they can see it from the tent.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.440
And what’s that?

22:43.400 --> 22:46.360
That bastard, had some sherry here
and I’m finishing it off.

22:46.520 --> 22:47.440
Fuck!

22:58.640 --> 22:59.600
Boss,

23:02.680 --> 23:06.360
the CEO position suits you very well.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.920
Sit down, please, Ms Tokyo.

23:16.280 --> 23:19.960
I can see you were late this morning.
I’ll have to report you.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.040
I’m terribly sorry, sir.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.520
If I...

23:27.600 --> 23:31.280
If I show you a breast, you won’t fire me?

23:32.560 --> 23:34.240
A tempting offer, that’s for sure,

23:35.800 --> 23:37.840
but you’ll have to offer me
something else.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.320
I know how you feel.

24:17.640 --> 24:19.000
-Rio...
-I’m here,

24:21.560 --> 24:22.880
inside this hole,

24:24.680 --> 24:26.880
and I start to think how I got here,

24:30.000 --> 24:30.960
and I can’t remember.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.600
I remember one day

24:36.200 --> 24:38.440
I was asked to hack a security system,

24:38.760 --> 24:41.120
and it turned out to be of a mansion
in Geneva,

24:41.200 --> 24:43.400
where nothing was left behind,
not even the carpets.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.520
I wasn’t even there.

24:47.680 --> 24:50.440
But, fuck, hacking a security system

24:50.520 --> 24:54.040
is far more fun
than being the IT in a company.

24:57.080 --> 25:00.400
So, I didn’t give it a second thought.
For me it was a game,

25:06.520 --> 25:08.200
and now my parents are not there anymore.

25:11.040 --> 25:12.360
My mother is gone, too.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.720
But it’s a little different, isn’t it?

25:17.760 --> 25:19.040
My parents are still alive.

25:22.960 --> 25:24.440
I could have been a legal guy.

25:27.440 --> 25:30.720
I was good at what I was doing,
I could earn my living.

25:34.520 --> 25:36.160
I could have had an ordinary life,

25:37.720 --> 25:39.080
meet an ordinary girl,

25:40.800 --> 25:42.120
have ordinary friends...

25:47.800 --> 25:49.080
I wasn’t like you.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.120
I don’t know what to tell you.

26:02.080 --> 26:03.680
I think I need your door.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.960
-Which door?
-The door you told me about

26:08.040 --> 26:10.120
the day we went to see the museum,

26:11.720 --> 26:13.760
the day we heard your mother had died.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.000
Cameras 12 y 13 have changed their lens.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.280
Now they have a wider range of vision.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.840
Camera 14 remains the same.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.560
It points into the hall.

26:54.920 --> 26:56.040
We can leave now.

26:59.640 --> 27:01.080
And why should we go?

27:02.840 --> 27:05.320
One day we can do a bit of sightseeing,

27:06.240 --> 27:07.720
kiss in bars,

27:08.800 --> 27:11.360
-on the street...
-On the street?

27:12.800 --> 27:15.320
Don’t kid me. Someone may catch you.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.360
No, not on the street.

27:22.400 --> 27:23.280
Follow me.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.720
I feel as if I killed her.

28:10.600 --> 28:11.960
She was so pretty...

28:13.640 --> 28:18.120
She’s died of grief, of absence,
of all the trouble I was in

28:19.880 --> 28:22.560
of my fucking crappy life....

28:35.320 --> 28:36.920
She only wanted to protect me.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.320
She loved me.

28:44.280 --> 28:45.760
She loved me to bits.

28:50.040 --> 28:52.360
And if she wanted to turn me over
to the police,

28:53.520 --> 28:55.640
it was not to see me dead on the news.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.640
When I was a little girl,

29:02.160 --> 29:04.720
I knew that, at her side,
nothing wrong would happen to me.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.520
The problem was when she wasn’t there.

29:11.720 --> 29:12.720
And your father?

29:14.480 --> 29:15.480
There’s no father.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.640
My mother worked in a suitcase factory.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.440
And when we couldn't make ends meet,

29:29.360 --> 29:30.640
she would work the night shift.

29:36.320 --> 29:38.840
And as she had no one
she could leave me with,

29:41.400 --> 29:42.720
she left me alone.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.040
I was really scared.

29:47.240 --> 29:48.520
How old were you?

29:51.680 --> 29:53.400
Eight, nine.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.280
A bit younger than you now.

30:07.200 --> 30:10.160
The thing is
that my mother came up with a trick.

30:11.560 --> 30:12.800
She draw a door

30:15.440 --> 30:17.160
on the wall of my room.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.160
It was a magic door.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.280
And, if I was scared,

30:25.080 --> 30:27.200
I could open it
and she would be behind it.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.360
And when she left, did you open it?

30:37.000 --> 30:39.120
She told me
that I could open it only once.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.200
Only once in my life,

30:45.320 --> 30:46.640
whenever I need it,

30:50.640 --> 30:51.520
but only once.

30:56.640 --> 30:58.280
So when I was scared,

31:00.640 --> 31:01.720
I used to think:

31:03.280 --> 31:05.520
"You can still hold on a little longer.

31:07.600 --> 31:08.680
A little longer."

31:12.920 --> 31:15.680
I used to think that the next day
I could feel more scared

31:18.920 --> 31:20.120
and feel more alone,

31:23.040 --> 31:24.400
and need the door.

31:33.040 --> 31:34.960
I would have opened it the first day.

31:40.280 --> 31:41.760
I never opened it.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.840
You are the strongest person I know,

31:52.640 --> 31:53.960
the most incredible one...

31:55.480 --> 31:56.480
and...

31:59.320 --> 32:00.200
And what?

32:03.640 --> 32:05.120
-And what?
-And...

32:06.720 --> 32:07.600
Damn!

32:08.960 --> 32:11.120
The car park.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.680
A parking ticket? What’s this?

32:13.760 --> 32:16.920
Yes, the regulated car park ticket from,
an Ibiza of 1992.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.200
"Two streets from here.
Check the date and the time.

32:21.080 --> 32:23.880
It’s the same day
the robbers went to the museum."

32:24.840 --> 32:25.960
Good job, Ángel.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.080
Run the registration number
through the database.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.240
I’ll be the most expensive fine
in history.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.360
"It’ll cost them
loads of millions of euros.

32:33.440 --> 32:34.960
Put me through the robber."

32:47.000 --> 32:48.520
-"Inspector."
-Professor,

32:50.120 --> 32:53.880
I need an answer. I want
those eight hostage, the underage people.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.080
Write down the names
the ones that are coming out.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.840
Pablo Holgado, Silvia Moreno,

33:02.280 --> 33:03.520
Abraham Salmerón,

33:04.280 --> 33:07.160
Ignasi Castell, Magdalena Ribot,

33:07.880 --> 33:11.000
Rocío Huertas, Jessica Sánchez

33:11.520 --> 33:14.160
-y Alicia Villanueva.
-What about Alison Parker?

33:15.200 --> 33:16.920
She’s one of the girls of Brighton.

33:17.400 --> 33:18.760
"I want her on the list."

33:19.200 --> 33:23.000
I can see you’re aware, Inspector.

33:23.320 --> 33:26.320
"You know as well as I do
that Alison is a queen of hearts

33:26.480 --> 33:30.280
-in this house of cards. I can’t do it."
-It’s a prerequisite that she comes out.

33:32.600 --> 33:33.840
I’ll make you a proposal:

33:36.200 --> 33:38.320
Alison in exchange
for the life of those eight people.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.440
Sorry, what did you say?

33:39.920 --> 33:41.840
"I’ll give you Alison Parker..."

33:42.920 --> 33:43.800
and no one else.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.840
We both know how important she is
both for you and for me,

33:48.560 --> 33:51.840
"so if you want her to come out,
she will come out alone."

33:54.280 --> 33:56.880
-I have to consult it.
-"You have one minute."

34:00.040 --> 34:02.240
Phone him and tell him,
that Parker is coming out.

34:02.320 --> 34:03.800
-I’m not willing to make that decision.

34:03.880 --> 34:06.280
It’s unethical to make a choice
on a hostage’s life

34:06.440 --> 34:07.960
"when you can save eight peoples’ lives.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.760
As much as you, and your ethical codes,
believe the opposite,"

34:10.920 --> 34:12.480
this is a matter of state.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.880
And the first thing will be getting
the ambassador’s daughter out of there.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.320
I’ll take all responsibility.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.520
Put me through the robber again.

34:37.240 --> 34:38.120
So what?

34:40.760 --> 34:41.760
Alison Parker.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.360
Are you sure?

34:48.280 --> 34:51.200
"You prefer saving Alison Parker’s life
to saving eight students’ lives?."

34:51.720 --> 34:54.160
-Yes, I’m sure.
-I see.

34:55.280 --> 34:58.800
Now, I have to think it over,
I wasn’t expecting that answer from you.

34:59.720 --> 35:01.440
"Give me an hour to think it over."

35:02.560 --> 35:05.000
All right. I’ll expect your phone call.

35:05.280 --> 35:06.440
If I don’t phone you,

35:08.320 --> 35:10.360
you’ll know anyway which decision I made.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.800
-What did he mean by that?
-I don’t know, but look,

35:19.160 --> 35:21.000
the Ibiza’s been deregistered
for ten years.

35:21.080 --> 35:22.920
No insurance, no owners no taxes.

35:23.080 --> 35:26.720
-It’s off the grid.
-"Attention everyone. Come, please."

35:27.280 --> 35:28.160
Come closer.

35:30.120 --> 35:33.640
What would you do if you had
to make a car disappear with no trace?

35:33.800 --> 35:36.120
-Set it on fire.
-"Well.

35:36.560 --> 35:40.520
Search for reports of burnt cars, both
municipal and from the Guardia Civil."

35:40.800 --> 35:41.680
Sink it.

35:43.040 --> 35:47.360
Look for any news of a car found
inside any swamps, rivers or wherever.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.840
-What else?
-Dismantle it, sell it in parts.

35:50.720 --> 35:53.120
-Burry it.
-Sorry?

35:53.240 --> 35:56.080
You dig a whole and you burry the car.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.040
I saw it in a film and it works.

36:01.280 --> 36:02.280
Anything else?

36:03.680 --> 36:04.920
What’s the legal way

36:05.000 --> 36:08.040
to make a car disappear
and erase any trace of it?

36:10.320 --> 36:12.880
To make a cube of scrap from it
in a wreck yard.

36:14.200 --> 36:17.760
"Priority: search in wrecking yards,
scrap yards, and similar places."

36:17.920 --> 36:19.600
Raquel, it’s Sunday, they’ll be closed.

36:19.680 --> 36:22.760
I don’t care. Get the owner out
of his house if necessary.

36:24.240 --> 36:25.120
Hurry up!

36:57.440 --> 36:58.320
Relax.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.360
Nothing is going to happen to you.

37:06.400 --> 37:10.080
You’ll be safer here, more isolated,

37:11.400 --> 37:14.040
you won’t find out about things
that will make you sad.

37:14.120 --> 37:16.440
I’m feeling better now.
Can I go back with the others?

37:16.680 --> 37:20.160
Aren’t you listening to me?
It’s better for you to stay here.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.840
I’ll have to bind you,

37:37.400 --> 37:40.880
because you’ll be alone,
But you’ll be better here.

37:41.120 --> 37:44.080
I won’t hurt you. That’s it.

37:46.240 --> 37:48.880
Let’s sit down. You don’t want to stand?

37:52.360 --> 37:55.440
Look, how dirty you got...
Where have you been?

38:00.040 --> 38:02.800
-Let me go back with the others, please.
-Calm down!

38:10.360 --> 38:11.480
You don’t understand?

38:15.120 --> 38:16.840
It’s them who are scared now...

38:18.560 --> 38:19.680
"it’s them."

38:26.160 --> 38:29.600
Girls, she’s coming back.
She’s coming back.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.640
I’m sure they’ll take her back now.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.960
It’s a little girl,
they won’t do anything to her.

38:49.280 --> 38:50.400
Rest now.

40:29.200 --> 40:32.360
-What will we do with so much money?
-I know exactly what:

40:32.440 --> 40:37.040
I’m going to get hold of
a clear sky blue colour Maserati.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.160
-It’s this red car.
-How long has it been here?

41:48.560 --> 41:49.480
I don’t know.

41:54.840 --> 41:57.680
I don’t know well, boss is not here today.

41:57.920 --> 41:58.800
Ah, really?

42:01.120 --> 42:04.920
Your boss told me you know
all the cars that are brought in.

42:07.840 --> 42:09.080
How long?

42:14.200 --> 42:15.560
Around 20 days.

42:17.480 --> 42:20.160
-Who brought it?
-Foreigner.

42:21.920 --> 42:23.040
From east Europe, not Russian.

42:25.040 --> 42:28.480
Go and bring the gloves and call CSI.
Tell them we’ve got the car.

42:31.680 --> 42:35.280
I understand that the man who left the car
showed you his ID.

42:40.360 --> 42:43.320
You issued an invoice for the purchase
of the vehicle, didn’t you?

42:46.840 --> 42:51.360
-Ticket.
-"Da, da." Maybe.

42:51.520 --> 42:53.120
-What do you mean maybe?
-Ángel,

42:53.520 --> 42:56.080
go to the office
and see if you find something, will you?

42:56.480 --> 42:57.760
Yes. Move.

43:15.920 --> 43:19.000
"...no comments about the leak,

43:19.080 --> 43:21.800
a conversation in which
Inspector Raquel Murillo

43:21.880 --> 43:25.160
negotiates with one of the kidnappers,
supposedly the ringleader...."

43:31.680 --> 43:32.760
"Inspector."

43:52.200 --> 43:53.080
You!

43:53.600 --> 43:54.480
You!

43:55.440 --> 43:57.560
See who that man is
and what’s he doing here.

43:58.360 --> 44:01.680
"The Inspector had checkmated
most probably.

44:01.880 --> 44:06.320
But even at that moment of desperation,
the Professor had kept an extra ball

44:06.640 --> 44:09.080
that was starting to be
on all the radios."

44:09.160 --> 44:11.920
"The spokesman in the shadow
has described

44:12.000 --> 44:14.400
as deplorable and shameful
that diplomatic relations

44:14.480 --> 44:18.360
take precedence over
the life of eight Spanish adolescents.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.960
We remind you of
the content in the recording."

44:23.520 --> 44:25.880
-Hello.
-Tokyo, listen to me.

44:25.960 --> 44:29.400
"The Professor had ordered me to leak
the conversation with the Inspector.

44:30.240 --> 44:33.520
A conversation that placed the Spanish
Government in a very awkward position

44:33.600 --> 44:34.720
and the Inspector herself."

44:34.880 --> 44:36.840
-"All right?
-Alison Parker.

44:36.920 --> 44:37.880
Are you sure?

44:37.960 --> 44:41.320
You prefer saving Alison Parker’s life
to eight students’ lives?

44:41.400 --> 44:42.640
Yes, I’m sure."

44:42.720 --> 44:44.880
"Perhaps because Berlin
had called him 'softie'

44:44.960 --> 44:47.080
and had decided to bang
his fist on the table

44:47.160 --> 44:49.120
and punish
all those who were against him."

44:49.200 --> 44:51.600
"The decision to release Alison Parker,

44:51.680 --> 44:54.480
the daughter of the British ambassador,
instead of eight Spanish youngsters,

44:54.560 --> 44:56.720
has been with no doubt
a controversial decision...."

44:56.800 --> 45:00.920
"Or simply that leak
started to make us into heroes

45:01.080 --> 45:02.840
in the eyes of the general public,

45:03.720 --> 45:05.360
but Raquel was like a hound dog."

45:05.440 --> 45:08.400
"...the British ambassador’s daughter,
Alison Parker...."

45:08.720 --> 45:10.480
"And she had picked up a scent,

45:11.360 --> 45:13.640
and one she wouldn’t lose,
because that scent was

45:13.800 --> 45:16.120
-of the head of the operation."
-Stop, Police!

45:18.720 --> 45:20.320
"The Professor himself."

45:21.960 --> 45:22.840
Nothing.

45:41.240 --> 45:44.440
-What are you doing here?
-I wasn’t stealing.

45:47.320 --> 45:48.200
I...

45:48.760 --> 45:51.160
-What the heck is that smell?
-Ammonia.

45:52.360 --> 45:53.960
I wasn’t stealing.

46:01.520 --> 46:04.680
"The Professor had become
a wretch of a human being to escape,

46:04.760 --> 46:07.160
but his performance wasn’t ended
and more was yet to come

46:07.240 --> 46:09.800
to avoid checkmate, and then he did it."

46:18.000 --> 46:18.880
You can go.

47:00.040 --> 47:00.920
It was him.

47:02.600 --> 47:03.600
It was him!
