WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:03.394
My name is Dylan Reinhart.
Not too long ago,

00:03.438 --> 00:06.571
I was an operative in the CIA
known as Agent Reinhart.

00:06.615 --> 00:09.183
When I left the Agency
and started teaching,

00:09.226 --> 00:10.575
I became Professor Reinhart.

00:10.619 --> 00:12.360
I wrote a book
about abnormal behavior

00:12.403 --> 00:14.753
and criminals,
which was so successful

00:14.797 --> 00:17.713
a serial killer used it
as clues for his murders.

00:17.756 --> 00:19.193
That's when the
New York Police Department

00:19.236 --> 00:21.064
reached out to me
to help catch him.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.935
Which I did, so they hired me,

00:22.979 --> 00:24.589
and I became
Consultant Reinhart.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.591
So now I'm working
with this woman,

00:26.635 --> 00:28.071
Detective Lizzie Needham

00:28.115 --> 00:30.552
of the homicide division,
catching killers.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.162
Looks like I need a new name.

00:32.206 --> 00:34.034
Don't they call you
Professor Psychopath?

00:39.387 --> 00:41.824
Don't overdo it today, Gary.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.826
Pace yourself.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.006
Surprise!

00:50.050 --> 00:51.268
Whoa.

00:51.312 --> 00:52.487
Bad time?

00:52.530 --> 00:54.271
No. No, it's never a bad time

00:54.315 --> 00:56.926
to see my little sister.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.363
LIZZIE: Um...Hi!

01:00.843 --> 01:04.151
Hi!
You look amazing,
as usual.

01:04.194 --> 01:05.369
What, is everything okay?

01:05.413 --> 01:06.631
Everything's great. Why?

01:06.675 --> 01:07.980
Well, I just... I, uh...

01:08.024 --> 01:09.460
I haven't seen you
since Christmas,

01:09.504 --> 01:11.071
and you live in Boulder, and...

01:11.114 --> 01:12.681
here you are in my house.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.422
I have a job thing.

01:14.465 --> 01:15.814
Okay.

01:15.858 --> 01:17.338
So you're here
looking for a job.

01:17.381 --> 01:18.426
That's good. Great.

01:18.469 --> 01:20.080
Really great news.

01:20.123 --> 01:22.125
Well, are you taking off?

01:22.169 --> 01:24.258
There's a murder
I need to get to.It's cool.

01:24.301 --> 01:26.608
I'll just chill with Gary.
I know where everything is.

01:28.218 --> 01:30.525
Okay. Let me know
if you need anything.Okay.

01:42.711 --> 01:45.322
MAN:
Photo, get a shot of that.

01:46.541 --> 01:47.933
Hey, Doc.
Good morning, Detective.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.761
Uh, not so far.
What have we got?

01:49.805 --> 01:51.459
Those two lovebirds right here

01:51.502 --> 01:53.200
were on their way
to a romantic encounter

01:53.243 --> 01:54.766
and literally tripped
over the remains.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.203
DYLAN: I'm guessing
that killed the mood.

01:56.246 --> 01:57.552
Our vic's a John Doe.

01:57.595 --> 01:58.901
Unis searched the
area for a weapon.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.729
Nothing so far. You need
anything, let me know.

02:00.772 --> 02:01.860
Okay.
Thanks.

02:01.904 --> 02:04.036
ZACK: I'm keeping
the lookie-loos away.

02:06.691 --> 02:08.389
He's just a kid.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.914
Can't be older than 18 or 19.

02:14.395 --> 02:15.831
Aw.

02:15.874 --> 02:18.007
The hem on his pants
is hand-stitched.

02:18.050 --> 02:20.009
Probably done by his mother.

02:20.052 --> 02:22.054
Makes it sadder somehow.

02:22.098 --> 02:24.231
We'll run these
through facial recognition.

02:24.274 --> 02:26.233
Key ring, no keys.

02:26.276 --> 02:27.886
Maybe they were stolen.

02:27.930 --> 02:31.020
Or maybe it's just
a good-luck amulet.

02:31.063 --> 02:32.848
Guess it didn't
do much good.

02:32.891 --> 02:34.023
Rigor's not far along.

02:34.066 --> 02:35.677
He's been dead
six hours max.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.201
Single slice made
with a straight-edge blade,

02:38.245 --> 02:40.334
possibly a hunting knife.

02:40.377 --> 02:42.074
No hesitation marks.

02:42.118 --> 02:44.338
Do you understand the level
of aggression it takes

02:44.381 --> 02:46.253
to make that cut
with one stroke?

02:46.296 --> 02:49.081
And to throw away the body,
not even try to hide it--

02:49.125 --> 02:51.736
just get rid of it
like it's garbage--

02:51.780 --> 02:55.218
demonstrates a flagrant
disregard for societal norms

02:55.262 --> 02:57.220
and a chilling lack of empathy.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.439
Whoever did this is a savage.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.702
"Savage" means
merely uncivilized.

03:00.745 --> 03:03.357
This is the work of a sociopath,

03:03.400 --> 03:05.185
a far more
dangerous creature.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.579
DYLAN:
Caleb Troyer, 19.

03:08.623 --> 03:09.885
Dixons Corners, New York.

03:09.928 --> 03:11.626
How far upstate is that?Two hours.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.584
Uh, local sheriff said
the family belongs

03:13.628 --> 03:15.282
to a strict
religious community.

03:15.325 --> 03:16.500
Yeah, I have it here.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.241
"The church espouses
an ascetic life,

03:18.285 --> 03:21.592
eschewing modern technology,
including phones and computers."

03:21.636 --> 03:23.333
"Espouses" and "eschewing"
in one sentence

03:23.377 --> 03:24.552
is just showing off.

03:24.595 --> 03:25.727
So they're, like, Amish?

03:25.770 --> 03:27.076
Kind of but not.

03:27.119 --> 03:29.470
"Formal education
ceases at 13."

03:29.513 --> 03:31.385
Wow. Some religions
reject Satan.

03:31.428 --> 03:32.951
They reject high school.

03:35.998 --> 03:37.869
WOMAN:
I just spoke to him Saturday

03:37.913 --> 03:41.133
on the pay phone
at the post office.

03:41.177 --> 03:44.006
Why did Caleb
move to New York?

03:44.049 --> 03:45.573
To find work.

03:45.616 --> 03:49.751
He went with another boy
from the church, Seth Weber,

03:49.794 --> 03:51.231
about six months ago.

03:51.274 --> 03:52.754
But I just spoke

03:52.797 --> 03:55.409
to his parents, and
they said that Seth

03:55.452 --> 03:56.975
told them that he and Caleb

03:57.019 --> 03:59.064
hadn't been living together
for some time.

03:59.108 --> 04:01.023
LIZZIE:
What did Caleb
do in the city?

04:01.066 --> 04:03.155
Construction.

04:03.199 --> 04:04.940
He'd send us
a hundred dollars every week.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.289
Alice.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.769
You people from the government?

04:07.812 --> 04:09.292
New York City Police, sir.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.946
We're trying to find out
what happened to your son.

04:10.989 --> 04:13.775
Do you know who Caleb
spent time with in New York?

04:13.818 --> 04:16.125
We don't know much
about his life in the city.

04:16.168 --> 04:18.083
Boy always kept secrets.

04:18.127 --> 04:20.999
Well, a lot
of teenagers do.

04:21.043 --> 04:22.740
We got things to do.

04:24.525 --> 04:27.136
Do you mind if we take
a look at Caleb's room?

04:29.878 --> 04:31.880
♪

04:35.231 --> 04:36.667
No posters.

04:36.711 --> 04:38.669
No electronics.

04:38.713 --> 04:40.280
If I was a teenager,

04:40.323 --> 04:42.760
I might want to get
out of here, too.

04:42.804 --> 04:44.240
Nice quilt, though.

04:45.328 --> 04:46.895
Hand-stitched.

04:49.071 --> 04:51.508
They just lost
their son,

04:51.552 --> 04:53.815
yet no warmth between them.

04:59.386 --> 05:02.040
Must have taken a lot
of courage for Caleb

05:02.084 --> 05:03.868
to defy such
a domineering father

05:03.912 --> 05:05.348
and move to New York.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.611
LIZZIE:
I bet the mom was Caleb's ally.

05:07.655 --> 05:08.612
Look.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.048
Oh, those are
the same feathers

05:10.092 --> 05:11.659
that were on
his key ring.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.096
What are those?

05:14.139 --> 05:15.706
Popsicle sticks?He kept them.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.099
In a lockbox.

05:17.142 --> 05:18.622
They must have meant
something to him.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.149
Mrs. Troyer, do you know
what these are?

05:25.455 --> 05:28.371
I've never seen them before.

05:28.415 --> 05:29.546
LIZZIE:
Mm-hmm.

05:29.590 --> 05:30.982
ALICE:
That photograph
of Caleb,

05:31.026 --> 05:33.376
do you think it might
be possible

05:33.420 --> 05:35.291
that I could keep it?

05:36.684 --> 05:38.163
Yes, of course. Here.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.952
Thank you.

05:45.475 --> 05:47.434
LIZZIE:
Caleb would've had a rough go

05:47.477 --> 05:48.957
in my family.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.828
We were always
in each other's business.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.439
He definitely had
a private life.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.092
I don't think he
went to New York

05:54.136 --> 05:55.267
to find work.

05:55.311 --> 05:57.966
I think the move was...
more personal.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.709
Man, there's
nothing personal.

06:01.752 --> 06:04.712
Just like his room at home.

06:04.755 --> 06:07.976
If 85% of the people born
into the community

06:08.019 --> 06:10.108
stay within the church
their entire lives,

06:10.152 --> 06:12.633
I wonder what happens
to the other 15%.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.504
You think it could be
someone from the church?

06:14.548 --> 06:16.245
Well, the church
defines its own rules,

06:16.288 --> 06:18.029
and Caleb's father
clearly disapproved

06:18.073 --> 06:19.379
of his decisions.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.598
Ooh. Blood.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.339
LIZZIE: Get a photo.
We need CSU here.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.734
Well, well, well.

06:26.777 --> 06:29.954
Looks like Caleb
was having a party.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.000
One with lipstick, one without.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.785
One joint with lipstick.

06:34.829 --> 06:35.830
Hmm.

06:38.136 --> 06:39.355
Hey! Stop!

06:41.879 --> 06:43.881
Hiding in the closet?

06:43.925 --> 06:45.622
Seriously?

06:49.365 --> 06:51.628
♪

06:59.854 --> 07:02.291
There's nothing going on,
Officer.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.640
Then why were
you standing

07:03.684 --> 07:04.946
in a closet?

07:04.989 --> 07:06.208
That's why.

07:06.251 --> 07:07.818
Who are you?

07:07.862 --> 07:09.820
Seth Weber.

07:09.864 --> 07:12.606
You're who Caleb
moved down here with.

07:12.649 --> 07:13.998
I live with my girlfriend now.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.478
DYLAN: What would your church
think about the weed?

07:15.522 --> 07:17.001
About you breaking
into Caleb's room?

07:17.045 --> 07:18.220
I didn't break in.

07:18.263 --> 07:19.308
The door was unlocked.

07:19.351 --> 07:20.483
And I didn't do this.

07:20.527 --> 07:21.658
I got here right before you.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.051
I came to get the money.

07:24.008 --> 07:27.359
Caleb's loaning me $95 for rent.

07:27.403 --> 07:29.318
He keeps his money
in the sock drawer.

07:29.361 --> 07:31.233
We don't trust banks
where we're from.

07:31.276 --> 07:34.149
The money's gone.

07:34.192 --> 07:36.499
Caleb's dead, Seth.

07:36.543 --> 07:37.848
He was killed.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.502
Dead?

07:39.546 --> 07:40.677
What...

07:40.721 --> 07:42.723
When was the last time
you saw him?

07:42.766 --> 07:45.029
Friday, when I
asked to borrow...

07:45.073 --> 07:47.031
You think I did it?Maybe he didn't

07:47.075 --> 07:48.903
lend you the money.
You and Caleb fought.

07:48.946 --> 07:50.339
No way.
DYLAN:
Maybe he was gonna

07:50.382 --> 07:51.688
tell your parents
about you smoking weed,

07:51.732 --> 07:53.342
about you living in sin
with your girl.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.083
Caleb wouldn't do that.
He was loyal.

07:55.126 --> 07:57.520
Besides, he's the one
who had secrets.

07:57.564 --> 07:58.695
What kind of secrets?

07:58.739 --> 08:00.218
I don't know,
but he...

08:00.262 --> 08:03.047
he used to disappear for hours
and never tell anyone

08:03.091 --> 08:04.614
where he was going.
Even back home,

08:04.658 --> 08:07.399
there was times he'd tell
his folks he was at work

08:07.443 --> 08:09.097
and I knew that wasn't true.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.751
Who were Caleb's friends here?

08:10.794 --> 08:12.535
Did he have a girlfriend?

08:12.579 --> 08:14.406
I don't know. He...

08:14.450 --> 08:16.147
I told him we were
having a party.

08:16.191 --> 08:18.672
He said the girl he was seeing
had a curfew

08:18.715 --> 08:20.804
and the guard wouldn't
let her in after 10:00.

08:20.848 --> 08:22.763
The guard?
I told you,

08:22.806 --> 08:24.242
the dude had secrets.

08:24.286 --> 08:26.593
Does this girl have a name?

08:26.636 --> 08:28.203
Nicki.

08:28.246 --> 08:31.162
Said he met her in the park.

08:34.470 --> 08:35.950
Seth's alibi holds.

08:35.993 --> 08:37.865
He was at his girlfriend's
cousin's place in Jersey

08:37.908 --> 08:39.301
when Caleb was killed.Uh-huh.

08:39.344 --> 08:40.607
Caleb's dad
has no record,

08:40.650 --> 08:41.999
but since the church
polices itself,

08:42.043 --> 08:43.261
that doesn't mean anything.

08:43.305 --> 08:45.046
They're not being
very cooperative.

08:45.089 --> 08:47.178
Blood on the drawer
was Caleb's,

08:47.222 --> 08:50.312
as was the DNA
on one beer bottle.

08:50.355 --> 08:54.490
DNA on the other bottle
and the joint belonged to...

08:54.534 --> 08:55.926
Unknown female,
presumably Nicki,

08:55.970 --> 08:58.276
who lives somewhere
with a guard.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.452
College dorms don't have
a 10:00 p.m. curfew.

09:00.496 --> 09:01.715
Rehab facility,

09:01.758 --> 09:03.586
halfway house, shelter?

09:03.630 --> 09:06.589
We're gonna be knocking
on a lot of doors.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.173
What are you doing?One second.

09:26.261 --> 09:28.219
32 black.

09:28.263 --> 09:30.482
How much do you bet
there are 56 white?

09:30.526 --> 09:32.963
Okay, Rain Man. Why 56?

09:33.007 --> 09:35.096
Because there are
88 keys on a piano.

09:35.139 --> 09:36.619
Piano?Well, a practice keyboard.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.969
I had one when I was a kid.
I think Caleb

09:39.013 --> 09:40.405
kept these hidden
because he was ashamed.

09:40.449 --> 09:43.104
His church considers
music a gateway to sin.

09:43.147 --> 09:47.891
And... the feathers are
from an eastern blue jay,

09:47.935 --> 09:49.153
a songbird.

09:49.197 --> 09:51.721
Keeping with the musical theme.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.897
Mm-hmm.
Okay, so where does
a kid like Caleb

09:53.941 --> 09:56.334
learn to play the piano?In every small town,

09:56.378 --> 09:58.510
there's at least
one piano teacher.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.476
DYLAN:
What was Caleb like?

10:07.519 --> 10:10.914
Caleb was such
a dear boy

10:10.958 --> 10:13.438
and so talented.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.745
After his third
lesson, he could play

10:15.789 --> 10:18.618
Bach's Concerto in
D Minor by ear.

10:18.661 --> 10:20.707
Mm-hmm.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.362
So, Mrs. Porter, you were...

10:24.406 --> 10:26.843
saying Caleb worked
for your husband?

10:26.887 --> 10:29.019
At his construction firm.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.456
Caleb came by the
house a few years ago

10:31.500 --> 10:33.458
when I was with a student,

10:33.502 --> 10:35.199
and he was fascinated.

10:35.243 --> 10:37.027
And after she left,

10:37.071 --> 10:40.683
I suggested he
touch a few keys.

10:40.727 --> 10:44.382
Well, he was shy at first,
but...

10:44.426 --> 10:46.210
the boy was a natural.

10:46.254 --> 10:47.516
So you started
giving him lessons?

10:47.559 --> 10:49.300
I never charged him.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.563
He was a true prodigy.

10:51.607 --> 10:55.002
Was Caleb conflicted
about his playing?

10:55.045 --> 10:56.133
Oh, yes.

10:56.177 --> 10:57.831
The church, his father.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.224
He hated keeping
the secret.

11:00.268 --> 11:03.314
He'd be at our house
for hours playing.

11:03.358 --> 11:05.403
But he had
such a gift.

11:05.447 --> 11:07.579
He was so happy
at the piano.

11:07.623 --> 11:10.452
So, he went to New York
to study piano?

11:10.495 --> 11:12.672
And stayed to apply
to Juilliard.

11:14.021 --> 11:16.066
Juilliard tapes
all the auditions.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.851
Caleb sent me the link.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.898
I sure appreciate you letting me
play for you today.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.639
MAN: Mr. Troyer,
you're very talented.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.162
He is very talented.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.686
DYLAN:
Wait.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.603
Do you know who that is?

11:31.647 --> 11:33.605
Caleb said her
name was Nicki.

11:33.649 --> 11:34.955
WOMAN:
Nicki Jones.

11:34.998 --> 11:37.087
She stayed at our
shelter for six weeks.

11:37.131 --> 11:38.915
She just left
a few days ago.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.482
Do you know where she went,

11:40.525 --> 11:42.136
why she left,
anything about her family?

11:42.179 --> 11:44.138
Kids come and go
all the time.

11:44.181 --> 11:46.270
I've never seen
a teenager

11:46.314 --> 11:48.098
on a landline before.

11:48.142 --> 11:49.621
Our kids are runaways,
throwaways.

11:49.665 --> 11:51.928
They don't have cells,
so I let them use

11:51.972 --> 11:53.147
our phones
to call home.

11:54.148 --> 11:55.540
Did you ever
see Nicki with Caleb?

11:55.584 --> 11:57.020
No.

11:57.064 --> 12:00.676
She was always with this
sullen-looking mouth breather.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.939
I call them
"Beauty and the Bro."

12:02.983 --> 12:04.811
Does "Bro" have a name?

12:04.854 --> 12:06.726
"Gene" is all I know.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.510
He's not one
of ours.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.555
The last day she was
here, they were arguing

12:10.599 --> 12:12.819
about this photographer,
talent agent

12:12.862 --> 12:14.298
or whatever he is.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.779
He said he could get
her some modeling jobs.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.782
He stole her bag or something.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.828
He left some fliers.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.179
Jimmy, it's me, Arvin.

12:25.222 --> 12:27.311
Are you smelling that?

12:27.355 --> 12:29.792
What is that?Decomp.

12:35.406 --> 12:37.365
You didn't notice this smell?

12:37.408 --> 12:39.236
I got allergies.

12:40.455 --> 12:41.848
Thank you.

12:49.899 --> 12:52.249
Purplish discoloration,

12:52.293 --> 12:54.556
early decomposition,
dried blood

12:54.599 --> 12:56.079
from his nose and mouth.

12:56.123 --> 12:58.081
He's been dead
at least 48 hours,

12:58.125 --> 13:01.476
which puts him out of the
running for killing Caleb.

13:01.519 --> 13:02.782
Single, deep cut to the throat.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.653
Fixed straight-edge blade.

13:04.696 --> 13:05.959
Our killer has a signature move.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.351
Two bodies in 48 hours.

13:07.395 --> 13:09.353
Are we dealing with a serial?

13:09.397 --> 13:11.181
Serials generally have
a cooling-off period

13:11.225 --> 13:12.835
between their hits,
usually a few weeks,

13:12.879 --> 13:14.358
and they rarely know
their victims.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.970
No, this is a spree killer.

13:17.013 --> 13:19.015
Rageful, ruthless.

13:19.059 --> 13:21.496
Unlike serial killers,
spree killers don't need

13:21.539 --> 13:23.193
a cooling-off time
between murders,

13:23.237 --> 13:26.066
which means we're going to find
another body very soon.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.639
Fucci and Harris are canvassing.

13:34.683 --> 13:37.729
So far, nobody knows nothin'.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.644
Could this be the bag
he stole from Nicki?

13:39.688 --> 13:40.950
Hmm.

13:43.257 --> 13:44.258
Yeah.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.086
Here's her shelter I.D.

13:46.129 --> 13:47.914
Lipstick, some condoms.

13:47.957 --> 13:51.265
LIZZIE:
Nicki's sister

13:51.308 --> 13:52.832
Hmm.

13:54.659 --> 13:57.097
Oh. Looks like Nicki
was an artist.

13:58.141 --> 13:59.273
Oh, my God.

13:59.316 --> 14:01.101
Wait, is that
meant to be...

14:01.144 --> 14:02.624
Caleb?

14:02.667 --> 14:04.234
There wasn't a
marsh in the park.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.801
She signs her stuff
"El Más Loco."

14:05.845 --> 14:06.889
In Spanish, that means

14:06.933 --> 14:08.195
"the craziest one."

14:08.238 --> 14:11.285
But no, it's the male
form of the word.

14:11.328 --> 14:13.983
Maybe Gene was the artist.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.158
And the killer?

14:16.116 --> 14:17.465
To kill men
this viciously,

14:17.508 --> 14:19.641
you'd have to have
power, strength.

14:19.684 --> 14:22.035
Well, spree killings
are normally triggered

14:22.078 --> 14:23.819
by an emotional upheaval.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.647
Maybe Gene was controlling
his compulsions,

14:25.690 --> 14:27.214
and then they exploded.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.869
Why now?
What makes him let go now?

14:29.912 --> 14:31.740
The trigger can often
be humiliation.

14:31.783 --> 14:33.785
If Gene was in a
relationship with Nicki,

14:33.829 --> 14:35.657
and then he found out
she'd been with Caleb

14:35.700 --> 14:37.311
and this photographer,

14:37.354 --> 14:39.661
maybe that's what set him
over the edge, and...

14:39.704 --> 14:41.358
he killed them both.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.882
And made art from it?

14:42.925 --> 14:46.320
Whoever did this was a
malignant narcissist.

14:46.363 --> 14:49.149
He didn't want anyone else to
take credit for what he'd done.

14:49.192 --> 14:50.324
He would brag about
it if he knew

14:50.367 --> 14:51.368
he wasn't going
to get caught.

14:52.979 --> 14:56.678
He could brag about it
anonymously on the Internet.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.636
Finding El Más Loco's work

14:58.680 --> 15:00.508
wasn't easy,
but we traced messages

15:00.551 --> 15:02.902
from him on anime sites
that linked to this Web site,

15:02.945 --> 15:06.644
BloodAndGore.com, where he
posted his work from a laptop

15:06.688 --> 15:08.646
using proxies
to hide his IP address.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.257
You think El Más Loco
is this kid Gene?

15:10.300 --> 15:11.780
DYLAN:
Yeah.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.651
Gene was going out with
Nicki, who was also

15:13.695 --> 15:15.349
with Caleb and
the photographer.

15:15.392 --> 15:17.960
And we found El Más Loco's
sketchbook in her bag--

15:18.004 --> 15:19.701
no readable fingerprints.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.616
Prints are tough
to find on paper.

15:21.659 --> 15:24.184
Then we found
these two drawings.

15:24.227 --> 15:27.970
They seem to be our victims
and were posted yesterday online

15:28.014 --> 15:29.276
using a cell phone.

15:29.319 --> 15:31.191
We track the cell,
we find El Más Loco.

15:31.234 --> 15:32.801
DYLAN:
Oh, we got the number.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.455
D.A.'s office
is getting a subpoena

15:34.498 --> 15:35.891
to I.D. who it's registered to.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.372
Hopefully
by end of day tomorrow.

15:38.415 --> 15:39.721
This guy's killed
twice in two days.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.027
We could have another
victim by then.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.680
Let me see if I can
speed things up.

15:45.161 --> 15:46.728
ANDY:
As you can see, the, uh...

15:46.771 --> 15:48.338
the foot traffic
we generate's

15:48.382 --> 15:49.687
actually better
than your projections.

15:49.731 --> 15:50.993
My proposal
is to give you

15:51.037 --> 15:52.908
a percentage of the profits
in lieu of rent.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.475
That way, you get
to participate

15:54.518 --> 15:56.390
in our success.
And, of course, you get

15:56.433 --> 15:58.653
all the free
drinks you want.

15:58.696 --> 16:01.569
Yeah, you see, the thing is,
is that this corner is gold.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.658
This place is always packed,
which is why I want

16:03.701 --> 16:05.399
to put in my own restaurant,

16:05.442 --> 16:08.228
you know, keep all the profits
and the free drinks.

16:08.271 --> 16:09.794
Are you kidding me?
No...

16:09.838 --> 16:12.014
Uh, in the past five years,
there have been

16:12.058 --> 16:13.407
three different restaurants
in this space.

16:13.450 --> 16:14.930
All of them have failed.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.845
It's not the corner
that's valuable.

16:16.888 --> 16:19.239
And it's not the
drinks or the food

16:19.282 --> 16:21.284
or the theme or the fact
that he works harder

16:21.328 --> 16:23.243
than everyone else
that makes Rafters so popular.

16:23.286 --> 16:26.463
It's Andy. It's his ability
to make everyone

16:26.507 --> 16:28.030
who walks through that door

16:28.074 --> 16:29.989
feel like they belong here,
like this is home.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.773
That's his gift.
If you have that gift,

16:31.816 --> 16:33.775
then knock yourself out,

16:33.818 --> 16:35.124
because this
is a risky business

16:35.168 --> 16:37.866
and you have
a sure thing right here.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.958
I'll get back to you.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.047
No. No.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.440
This is a
one-time-only offer.

16:46.483 --> 16:47.789
We think it's
more than fair.

16:47.832 --> 16:49.617
You get a piece
of our hard work,

16:49.660 --> 16:51.619
with none of the risk.

16:51.662 --> 16:53.838
So... you decide if
it's worth it for you.

16:53.882 --> 16:56.145
You got 48 hours.

16:57.407 --> 16:59.540
You'll have my answer.

17:02.151 --> 17:04.153
Did I overplay our hand?
I slightly overplayed...

17:04.197 --> 17:05.633
No, no, you were like a shark.

17:05.676 --> 17:07.113
You were scrappy
and cutthroat and sexy.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.723
If he's too dumb

17:08.766 --> 17:11.030
to take a great deal,
then we will find another corner

17:11.073 --> 17:13.032
and you will work
your magic there.

17:17.732 --> 17:19.734
♪

17:24.130 --> 17:25.914
What time's the cage fight?

17:25.957 --> 17:27.959
Undercard at 6:00,
and then the main event.

17:28.003 --> 17:30.310
You should come.
There are still tickets.

17:30.353 --> 17:32.051
I'm good.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.880
Well, no, I'm not good.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.578
No.

17:38.709 --> 17:40.233
Caleb.

17:40.276 --> 17:43.149
You see yourself
in him.

17:43.192 --> 17:46.761
I was lucky to have a mother
who understood me,

17:46.804 --> 17:49.981
and not to cross paths
with a murderer.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.119
I have to go.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.990
Enjoy.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.645
Thanks. Sorry for the mess.

18:01.689 --> 18:02.777
MAN:
Okay.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.909
Thanks for nothing!

18:04.953 --> 18:06.520
Loser!

18:06.563 --> 18:08.348
Sorry for the excitement, guys.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.524
This is my sister.
She's just visiting.Listen.

18:10.567 --> 18:13.092
I know that I threw up
in his cab, but...

18:13.135 --> 18:15.355
he wasn't gonna let me go
until I gave him money,

18:15.398 --> 18:18.314
and that is basically
kidnapping.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.882
I'm fine.Of course you are.

18:22.057 --> 18:23.754
I'm gonna pay you back.

18:23.798 --> 18:25.582
That's okay.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.323
You know what I was thinking?

18:27.367 --> 18:29.369
I could be a cop.

18:29.412 --> 18:32.720
Because I like helping people,

18:32.763 --> 18:36.071
and I'm a closet
excitement junkie.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.986
Yeah, I think that runs
in the family.

18:51.739 --> 18:53.088
Hey.
Hey.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.959
How was the MMA?
Nice cage fight?

18:55.003 --> 18:56.439
Uh, I suppose, yeah.

18:56.483 --> 18:58.224
Jasmine had the subpoena
fast-tracked.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.269
Turned out the phone
belonged to the photographer.

19:00.313 --> 19:03.577
Gene must have stolen it
from him when he killed him.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.753
TARU triangulated the signal
and traced it

19:05.796 --> 19:08.408
here-- the home of
Dr. and Mrs. Higgins.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.671
Gene's parents.
Oh, and guess what.

19:10.714 --> 19:13.848
Turns out Gene has an open
warrant for possession.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.938
Look. Nicki.

19:16.981 --> 19:18.896
Get her. I'll look
out for him. Go.

19:23.684 --> 19:26.948
Nicki Jones? NYPD.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.130
Gene Higgins?

19:36.523 --> 19:38.351
NYPD.

19:38.394 --> 19:39.743
Stop!

19:51.929 --> 19:53.844
What's this?

19:53.888 --> 19:55.237
Now talk to me.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.544
Screw you, bitch.
I'm not saying a word.

19:57.587 --> 19:59.285
I'll call
my parents' lawyer.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.461
You'll be the one
having to talk.
Shut up, Gene.

20:01.504 --> 20:03.767
I hope your daddy's lawyer
is smarter than you are.

20:03.811 --> 20:05.247
I tossed him.Yes, ma'am.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.988
Do your parents know
you're in New York?

20:07.031 --> 20:08.381
I'm not sure.

20:08.424 --> 20:09.947
You don't want
to get them involved.

20:09.991 --> 20:11.427
I understand,
but you have to

20:11.471 --> 20:12.646
explain yourself, Nicki.

20:12.689 --> 20:14.256
My name isn't Nicki.

20:14.300 --> 20:17.694
I don't know what it is.

20:17.738 --> 20:20.306
I can't remember who I
am or where I'm from.

20:20.349 --> 20:22.395
Please help me.

20:22.438 --> 20:25.572
I can't remember anything.

20:37.671 --> 20:38.541
This is Dr. Chandler.

20:38.585 --> 20:40.282
She's a psychiatrist.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.892
We'll be assessing
your condition.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.681
This was in
your backpack.

20:47.724 --> 20:50.423
Do you recognize her?

20:52.207 --> 20:53.469
No.

20:54.731 --> 20:57.081
The farthest back you remember
is six weeks ago,

20:57.125 --> 20:59.475
finding yourself
in Times Square?

20:59.519 --> 21:02.173
I didn't have any money or I.D.

21:02.217 --> 21:04.480
I didn't know where I came from.

21:04.524 --> 21:08.223
I-I'm hearing a slight coastal
New England accent.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.616
Is it possible
you're from Boston?

21:09.659 --> 21:11.444
Or, uh, Rhode Island?

21:11.487 --> 21:12.880
Maine?

21:12.923 --> 21:14.185
Did you go to the police?

21:14.229 --> 21:16.057
I met Gene.

21:16.100 --> 21:20.148
He took me to the shelter,
and he said I'd be safe there.

21:20.191 --> 21:22.063
Things were good.

21:22.106 --> 21:24.021
Till I met that creepy
photographer

21:24.065 --> 21:25.675
a couple weeks ago.

21:25.719 --> 21:27.111
And what happened with him?

21:29.200 --> 21:32.073
He said he'd pay me to model.

21:32.116 --> 21:34.641
When I went there,

21:34.684 --> 21:37.339
he tried to...

21:39.298 --> 21:42.388
I got away,
but I left my bag.

21:42.431 --> 21:45.042
Hold on. Did Gene
confront the photographer

21:45.086 --> 21:46.566
after he tried to...?

21:46.609 --> 21:48.655
I don't know.
But he said I wouldn't

21:48.698 --> 21:50.396
have to worry about him anymore.

21:50.439 --> 21:53.573
Then I saw his drawing.

21:53.616 --> 21:55.052
The one of the photographer

21:55.096 --> 21:57.098
with his throat sliced
that he put online?

21:57.141 --> 21:58.491
Yeah.

21:58.534 --> 22:02.799
And then you met Caleb
in the park?

22:04.235 --> 22:06.586
He took me to dinner, and...

22:06.629 --> 22:08.196
I went back to his room.

22:08.239 --> 22:10.938
I saw him a few more times
after, but...

22:10.981 --> 22:14.289
Gene caught us
and, like, lost it.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.422
Tried to hit me.

22:16.465 --> 22:17.771
Caleb stopped him.

22:17.814 --> 22:18.859
I ran away.

22:21.209 --> 22:23.820
Later, Gene said, if I ever
try to leave him again,

22:23.864 --> 22:25.822
he'll kill me.

22:25.866 --> 22:28.477
Did he tell you
that Caleb was dead?

22:28.521 --> 22:30.653
I saw the drawing.

22:32.002 --> 22:33.439
How did you feel
when you realized

22:33.482 --> 22:34.657
Caleb had been murdered?

22:36.833 --> 22:39.270
I kept thinking
it could have been me.

22:47.931 --> 22:50.456
Hey. Can you give these
to Lizzie for me?

22:50.499 --> 22:52.240
I'm kind of in a hurry.
Oh.

22:52.283 --> 22:53.459
MMA tickets.

22:53.502 --> 22:54.982
She went last night.

22:55.025 --> 22:56.375
I messed that up.

22:56.418 --> 22:57.550
Big surprise.

22:57.593 --> 22:58.899
Those are sort of
a thank-you.

22:58.942 --> 23:00.074
Or an apology.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.510
You know how it is
with sisters.

23:01.554 --> 23:03.164
Actually, I don't.

23:03.207 --> 23:05.340
When you have a big sister,
especially one like Lizzie,

23:05.384 --> 23:07.255
it's kind of like
having an extra mom.

23:07.298 --> 23:09.475
You know, she was always
looking out for me as a kid.

23:09.518 --> 23:10.954
Kept me out of trouble.

23:10.998 --> 23:12.652
You should give her these
yourself.

23:12.695 --> 23:14.741
I don't
really need to see

23:14.784 --> 23:16.917
how I let her down again.

23:20.094 --> 23:22.575
Forensics says nothing puts Gene
at either crime scene.

23:22.618 --> 23:25.969
No blood, no fingerprints,
no fibers, not even a hair.

23:26.013 --> 23:27.188
He had hands on these guys.

23:27.231 --> 23:28.755
There has to be
some trace of him.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.670
Am I missing something?
Does this seem right to you?

23:30.713 --> 23:32.672
None of it seems
right to me.

23:32.715 --> 23:35.152
His priors are for possession--
nothing violent.

23:35.196 --> 23:37.198
All we have on him is
what Nicki gave us.

23:37.241 --> 23:38.808
Oh, your, um, sister
bought these.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.897
As an apology or a thank-you.
I couldn't quite tell.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.377
Oh, then I guess
we're all good.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.596
She knows she upset you.

23:43.639 --> 23:44.640
:
Of course.

23:44.684 --> 23:45.815
That's Katie's way.

23:45.859 --> 23:48.339
She decides what's real.

23:51.952 --> 23:53.823
So does Nicki.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.434
What?

23:56.783 --> 24:00.569
All we have
is what she gave us.

24:00.613 --> 24:02.919
She's creating the narrative.

24:04.268 --> 24:07.097
What if Nicki is our killer?

24:07.141 --> 24:09.056
She controlled
the victims somehow.

24:09.099 --> 24:12.059
She had no empathy for that boy.

24:12.102 --> 24:15.192
I think she's the malignant
narcissist, not Gene.

24:15.236 --> 24:16.759
I think she's a sociopath.

24:16.803 --> 24:18.892
Okay. What's her motive?

24:18.935 --> 24:20.589
She says the photographer
tried to rape her,

24:20.633 --> 24:22.156
but why kill Caleb?

24:23.723 --> 24:25.246
I don't know.

24:25.289 --> 24:26.595
Hmm. That's a first.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.075
I'm only saying that
to motivate

24:28.118 --> 24:30.773
my unconscious to work faster.

24:30.817 --> 24:33.515
Narcissists need to show off.

24:33.559 --> 24:35.212
Well, in that case,
having to keep

24:35.256 --> 24:37.432
these two murders a secret
must be driving her crazy.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.434
Yes. Good.
She must be dying

24:39.478 --> 24:41.915
to let us know how clever
she is, to get our praise.

24:41.958 --> 24:44.308
So let's give it to her,
then take it away.

24:44.352 --> 24:47.964
Make her angry
and see how careless she gets.

24:48.008 --> 24:49.575
Huh.

24:49.618 --> 24:51.925
I guess I did know after all.

24:53.274 --> 24:55.581
My lawyer said,
since I have amnesia,

24:55.624 --> 24:59.149
they'll wipe out the charges
against me if I testify.

24:59.193 --> 25:03.458
You know, I didn't
like that lady doctor,

25:03.502 --> 25:06.417
the way she looked
at me all judgy.

25:06.461 --> 25:08.768
But I could tell
we clicked.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.336
You'll be asked to explain

25:12.380 --> 25:14.904
why your DNA
is all over both victims.

25:14.948 --> 25:17.124
That creepy photographer
was all over me.

25:17.167 --> 25:18.995
And I slept with Caleb.

25:19.039 --> 25:21.258
In the park,
where he was killed?

25:21.302 --> 25:22.825
Yeah, under the stars.

25:22.869 --> 25:24.653
It was actually very sweet.

25:24.697 --> 25:26.307
Until Gene showed up.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.223
You have an answer
for everything.

25:31.181 --> 25:33.793
So, Nicki, did Gene
ever tell you

25:33.836 --> 25:35.838
that he killed
Jim or Caleb?

25:35.882 --> 25:37.144
He never did.

25:37.187 --> 25:39.625
Did you see anything
that might implicate him?

25:39.668 --> 25:42.192
Bloody clothes,
shoes, the knife?

25:42.236 --> 25:44.107
We know the knife
was cleaned with bleach.

25:44.151 --> 25:47.328
Did you maybe see him
buy the bleach?

25:47.371 --> 25:50.853
I need you to dig deep,
really think.

25:50.897 --> 25:54.378
There's, like... nothing.

25:54.422 --> 25:56.337
Thing is, Nicki...

25:56.380 --> 25:59.949
there's no evidence that Gene
was at either crime scene.

26:01.298 --> 26:03.257
And these are
fingers-in-the-flesh murders.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.389
It's very difficult not
to leave something behind.

26:05.433 --> 26:10.177
It's as if a ghost
committed the perfect crime.

26:10.220 --> 26:11.221
Twice.

26:13.310 --> 26:14.834
Guess you guys will just have

26:14.877 --> 26:17.793
to look harder
to prove Gene did it.

26:17.837 --> 26:21.492
But no matter how hard we look,

26:21.536 --> 26:24.278
you and I both know
that we won't find anything

26:24.321 --> 26:26.541
because Gene
was never there.

26:26.585 --> 26:30.763
The only person
who was at both crime scenes...

26:30.806 --> 26:31.981
is you.

26:33.548 --> 26:36.203
Is this the part where you
ask me if I killed them?

26:36.246 --> 26:38.509
I guess it is. Yeah.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.381
Why would you even think that?

26:40.424 --> 26:43.863
Because you don't
understand empathy.

26:44.994 --> 26:46.996
It's not your fault.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.476
You can mimic it.

26:48.519 --> 26:50.043
You can recognize it in others.

26:50.086 --> 26:52.045
But...

26:52.088 --> 26:54.656
you never fully comprehend it.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.397
That's your proof?

26:57.616 --> 26:59.226
I have no proof.

26:59.269 --> 27:00.793
Because there isn't any.

27:00.836 --> 27:02.055
Not yet.

27:03.447 --> 27:05.885
Everyone makes a mistake.

27:05.928 --> 27:08.278
It's just
a matter of time.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.153
JASMINE:
So you think the amnesia

27:13.196 --> 27:15.503
is a crock

27:15.546 --> 27:16.765
I do.

27:16.809 --> 27:18.245
Why choose amnesia?

27:18.288 --> 27:19.812
It doesn't insulate her
from the murders.

27:19.855 --> 27:21.248
It only hides her past,

27:21.291 --> 27:22.423
which seems clean.

27:22.466 --> 27:24.077
She's not in the system.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.818
She may not have been
our problem up till now,

27:25.861 --> 27:27.080
but she was somebody's.

27:27.123 --> 27:29.691
You don't just start
with murder.

27:29.735 --> 27:33.260
Not a murder this well-planned,
this violent, this intimate.

27:33.303 --> 27:34.783
You work up to it.

27:34.827 --> 27:37.917
She's a sociopath, a predator,

27:37.960 --> 27:39.483
and she's hunting men.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.485
There's something in her past.

27:41.529 --> 27:43.705
Yeah, but her story rings true.
It's not neat.

27:43.749 --> 27:46.142
Like, she didn't say that she
saw Gene kill these guys

27:46.186 --> 27:47.927
or even that he told her he did.

27:47.970 --> 27:49.102
She's a narcissist.
Why would she

27:49.145 --> 27:50.973
let someone else
get credit for it?

27:51.017 --> 27:53.106
To exonerate herself.Oh, you should've
seen her.

27:53.149 --> 27:56.457
She is thrilled
we know she did it.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.111
JASMINE:
So prove it.

27:58.154 --> 27:59.460
Get me something
I can use.

27:59.503 --> 28:02.463
A witness, a videotape.

28:02.506 --> 28:04.639
Better still, a confession.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.467
She really doesn't look
like the type.

28:06.510 --> 28:08.730
That's the thing about people.

28:08.774 --> 28:11.124
They always surprise you.

28:13.039 --> 28:14.954
I have to say
something to you.

28:14.997 --> 28:17.173
I'm not sure why you
missed the cage fight,

28:17.217 --> 28:20.002
but I know it has something
to do with Katie.

28:20.046 --> 28:22.526
Yeah, she got drunk
and puked in a cab.

28:22.570 --> 28:23.702
I had to help her.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.747
How?
I paid for it.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.531
We do things for family.

28:27.575 --> 28:29.925
I've been cleaning up
after her forever.

28:29.969 --> 28:31.057
It's so predictable.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.232
Maybe your perspective's

28:32.275 --> 28:33.712
a little predictable, too.

28:33.755 --> 28:34.974
What?When Katie handed me

28:35.017 --> 28:36.149
those MMA tickets, it was

28:36.192 --> 28:37.280
because she couldn't face you.

28:38.499 --> 28:39.979
Avoidance is one
of her specialties.

28:40.022 --> 28:42.677
Yeah, well, it must
run in the family.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.331
If you keep rescuing someone
all the time,

28:44.374 --> 28:46.072
you're denying them
the opportunity

28:46.115 --> 28:47.943
to learn from
their own mistakes,

28:47.987 --> 28:48.944
to grow up.

28:48.988 --> 28:50.424
Is there a polite way of saying

28:50.467 --> 28:51.468
"mind your own business"?

28:51.512 --> 28:52.643
:
Yes.

28:52.687 --> 28:54.080
"Please shut up."

28:54.123 --> 28:56.604
Please shut up.No, I will not.

28:56.647 --> 28:59.346
You owe it to her and yourself
to change the dynamic.

28:59.389 --> 29:01.827
Stop enabling her.

29:07.615 --> 29:11.488
Hey. Do you have any
good Mexican around here?

29:11.532 --> 29:13.490
Villa del Sol.

29:13.534 --> 29:15.579
:
Villa del Sol.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.323
What's wrong?

29:20.367 --> 29:22.586
I have to stop.

29:22.630 --> 29:23.979
Stop?

29:24.023 --> 29:25.415
Yeah.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.374
And you have to stop, too.

29:27.417 --> 29:28.375
Stop what?

29:28.418 --> 29:29.593
The drinking.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.770
And my letting
it happen.

29:31.813 --> 29:34.033
No more stepping in
to make things go away.

29:34.076 --> 29:35.599
I did it with Mom.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.732
I'm not gonna do it with you.
Not anymore.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.560
You have to take
responsibility.

29:40.909 --> 29:43.433
It is so perfect
that you are a cop,

29:43.477 --> 29:46.219
because you get to tell
everybody what they do wrong

29:46.262 --> 29:48.351
and make everybody else
feel like a failure.

29:48.395 --> 29:50.832
I don't do that.Really?

29:50.876 --> 29:53.748
You can't drink
if you want to stay here.

30:15.161 --> 30:19.078
Well, it's not quite the, uh,
date night out I was hoping for,

30:19.121 --> 30:20.775
but I'll take it.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.255
I'm sorry.

30:22.298 --> 30:23.299
We're short-staffed.

30:23.343 --> 30:24.735
I made the hostess
a waitress,

30:24.779 --> 30:26.389
the dishwasher a busboy.

30:26.433 --> 30:29.131
Which means I'll be
washing dishes.

30:29.175 --> 30:31.612
Living the dream.

30:31.655 --> 30:33.483
You know my favorite
part of the day?

30:33.527 --> 30:34.920
It's when you come home.

30:34.963 --> 30:37.226
You're exhausted,
but you're happy.

30:37.270 --> 30:39.750
When you were a lawyer,
you were never happy.

30:39.794 --> 30:42.449
Now, I know the last few
weeks have been difficult.

30:42.492 --> 30:44.668
And, of course, there was the
landlord's little surprise.

30:44.712 --> 30:47.976
But... this is not a sign.

30:48.020 --> 30:49.804
Well, sign or no sign,
we could lose

30:49.848 --> 30:51.675
our life savings
on a gamble

30:51.719 --> 30:54.417
just because I always
wanted to own a bar.

30:54.461 --> 30:57.290
I do not consider this
bar or you a gamble.

30:58.552 --> 31:00.989
You're the best
investment I ever made.

31:03.992 --> 31:07.300
Hi. I'm waitress, and I'll be
your Candice tonight.

31:07.343 --> 31:09.693
Oh. I mean...That's all right, Candice.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.260
Uh, Candice has never
waited tables before.

31:11.304 --> 31:12.827
What?

31:12.871 --> 31:15.830
Very different from
showing people to the tables.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.397
Is that a Philadelphia
accent I hear?

31:17.440 --> 31:19.442
Really? I've been trying
to get rid of it.

31:19.486 --> 31:22.881
There's not too many roles
for Philly girls out there.

31:25.666 --> 31:28.756
DYLAN: I'm hearing a slight
coastal New England accent.

31:28.799 --> 31:30.062
Could you be from Boston?

31:30.105 --> 31:31.715
Rhode Island

31:33.369 --> 31:34.501
They don't have cells,

31:34.544 --> 31:36.155
so I let them use
our phones to call home.

31:36.198 --> 31:37.808
DYLAN: She may not
have been our problem

31:37.852 --> 31:39.375
up till now,
but she was somebody's.

31:39.419 --> 31:41.943
You don't just start
with savage murder.

31:41.987 --> 31:43.423
You work up to it.

31:51.953 --> 31:53.476
Lizzie?

31:53.520 --> 31:55.696
We need to find
Nicki's first victim.

31:55.739 --> 31:57.219
And I know how.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.227
Based on Nicki's accent,
we narrowed

32:05.271 --> 32:06.837
her home down
to New England.

32:06.881 --> 32:08.883
The kids in the shelter use
the landline, so we went

32:08.927 --> 32:10.841
through all the calls
to New England.We found three calls

32:10.885 --> 32:13.366
to a boarding school
in Newport, Rhode Island.

32:13.409 --> 32:14.976
The headmaster I.D.'d
Nicki's photo.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.978
Real name: Amber Burnett.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.893
The girl in the wheelchair,
who was Nicki's roommate,

32:18.937 --> 32:20.112
is still there.

32:20.155 --> 32:21.330
We called the Newport PD.

32:21.374 --> 32:23.028
There's a reason
she hid her past.

32:23.071 --> 32:24.638
It wasn't her first murder.

32:27.423 --> 32:30.339
People have always
been jealous of Nicki.

32:30.383 --> 32:33.299
Ella, we need to talk to you
about something serious.

32:33.342 --> 32:35.431
Is it Brendan?

32:37.738 --> 32:39.696
Please tell us what you know.

32:39.740 --> 32:41.916
He's a townie.
He was Nicki's boyfriend,

32:41.960 --> 32:43.613
but he kind of disappeared.

32:45.050 --> 32:47.008
She told the cops
that she didn't know anything,

32:47.052 --> 32:49.141
but they don't believe her.
That's why she ran away.

32:49.184 --> 32:50.925
What do you think, Ella?

32:50.969 --> 32:52.579
She really liked him.

32:52.622 --> 32:55.147
It doesn't make sense
that she could...

32:55.190 --> 32:57.149
Ella, the Newport Police

32:57.192 --> 32:59.064
have found Brendan's body.

32:59.107 --> 33:00.674
His throat was cut.

33:00.717 --> 33:02.067
That's the same way

33:02.110 --> 33:04.069
two men in New York
were killed last week.

33:04.112 --> 33:06.506
A photographer
and a young man

33:06.549 --> 33:08.595
Brendan's age, your age.Oh, my God.

33:08.638 --> 33:11.815
Ella, I know this is moving
very, very fast, but...

33:11.859 --> 33:14.818
we think Nicki killed Brendan
and these two men.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.344
Will you help us?

33:20.650 --> 33:22.696
DYLAN:
Ella's a lonely kid.

33:22.739 --> 33:25.003
Along comes Nicki--
beautiful, exciting,

33:25.046 --> 33:27.527
pays her attention--
and soon Ella's devoted.

33:27.570 --> 33:30.008
That I get, but
given who Nicki is,

33:30.051 --> 33:31.139
why befriend Ella?

33:31.183 --> 33:32.619
Ella's her plaything.

33:32.662 --> 33:34.534
Sociopaths will continue
a relationship

33:34.577 --> 33:36.188
as long as they get
something from it.

33:36.231 --> 33:38.451
Huh. Never a bad idea
to have a loyal acolyte

33:38.494 --> 33:39.974
who will lie for you.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.976
And tell you what
the police are asking

33:42.020 --> 33:44.283
once you've fled
to New York.

33:44.326 --> 33:46.981
DYLAN:
Showtime.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.288
Okay, Ella,
just like we said.

33:49.331 --> 33:50.898
I'm scared.

33:50.941 --> 33:52.117
She's gonna hate me.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.292
DYLAN:
She's sick.

33:53.335 --> 33:54.510
Remember?

33:54.554 --> 33:55.903
You're helping her.

34:02.127 --> 34:03.867
Hey, Nut.

34:05.391 --> 34:07.132
Do I know you?

34:07.175 --> 34:10.787
Amber, it's me,
Elle's Bells.

34:10.831 --> 34:12.093
Amber.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.616
Is that my name?

34:13.660 --> 34:14.922
I'm your roommate.

34:14.965 --> 34:16.489
I'm your best friend.

34:16.532 --> 34:18.708
Your hair looks awesome.

34:18.752 --> 34:22.321
I didn't know it was
gonna be that blonde.

34:24.018 --> 34:25.585
Great, Ella.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.456
Now get into it.

34:27.500 --> 34:31.286
So... the cops found Brendan
by the marsh.

34:31.330 --> 34:34.072
Right where you guys
used to always meet up.

34:34.115 --> 34:36.465
I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:36.509 --> 34:38.163
Don't worry. I told
them that you didn't

34:38.206 --> 34:39.773
leave the room
after dinner.

34:39.816 --> 34:41.209
And they found
some footprints.

34:41.253 --> 34:43.864
They asked me what kind
of sneakers you had.

34:43.907 --> 34:45.126
Keep the story going,
but tell her

34:45.170 --> 34:46.432
you want to go
to the restroom.

34:46.475 --> 34:48.738
I told them that you
only wear flats.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.827
Oh, and check this out.

34:50.871 --> 34:55.528
Actually, first, can we
go to the restroom?

35:00.837 --> 35:02.839
If you can't
remember Ella,

35:02.883 --> 35:04.624
how do you know
she uses a wheelchair?

35:06.669 --> 35:09.281
Guess I made a mistake.

35:09.324 --> 35:10.891
Took you a while, though.

35:10.934 --> 35:13.546
Thought I was home free
till I saw Elle's Bells.

35:13.589 --> 35:15.200
:
She's a pathetic loser.

35:15.243 --> 35:16.810
LIZZIE:
Let's go, Amber.

35:17.985 --> 35:19.769
OFFICER:
Come on.

35:21.771 --> 35:23.251
DYLAN:
Why?

35:23.295 --> 35:24.861
Why did you kill them?

35:24.905 --> 35:26.428
AMBER:
Why not?

35:26.472 --> 35:28.778
They didn't give a damn
about me.

35:28.822 --> 35:32.173
The photographer said
he'd get me modeling jobs.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.741
And then the bastard
stole my bag.

35:34.784 --> 35:37.047
DYLAN:
Did Gene know anything?

35:37.091 --> 35:40.529
AMBER: He's a moron. I'd just tell him what to draw.

35:40.573 --> 35:42.270
DYLAN:
And Caleb?

35:42.314 --> 35:45.099
AMBER: We went to his room
to get money for dinner.

35:45.143 --> 35:49.799
That hick had like $400
in his drawer.

35:49.843 --> 35:52.062
DYLAN:
None of them fought back?

35:52.106 --> 35:54.108
AMBER: We'd get busy.
Know what I'm saying?

35:54.152 --> 35:57.938
And then after,
they'd be lying there,

35:57.981 --> 36:01.985
eyes closed,
big smile on their face,

36:02.029 --> 36:04.466
and I'd just...

36:07.600 --> 36:09.993
DYLAN: We found this
in Caleb's apartment.

36:11.038 --> 36:12.344
It's addressed to you.

36:19.960 --> 36:23.268
He wants our blessing
to study piano.

36:25.792 --> 36:28.621
LIZZIE:
We thought you might
like to have this.

36:28.664 --> 36:29.926
MR. TROYER:
We can't accept it.

36:29.970 --> 36:33.016
Oh, God would understand.

36:45.681 --> 36:47.640
:
Oh...

36:55.169 --> 36:56.779
That's my son.

37:12.969 --> 37:14.449
Hi.
Hey.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.799
48 hours is up.

37:18.714 --> 37:20.673
He's already taking
advantage of the free booze.

37:20.716 --> 37:23.197
We have a new silent partner?

37:23.241 --> 37:25.199
Oh, I think he's going to be
anything but silent.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.768
To following your dreams.

37:28.811 --> 37:31.074
To relying on each other.

37:33.468 --> 37:34.774
Mmm.

37:34.817 --> 37:36.776
I'm actually here with Lizzie.

37:36.819 --> 37:39.431
We're having dinner
to celebrate closing the case.

37:39.474 --> 37:41.868
Yeah, I don't think
she got the memo

37:41.911 --> 37:43.522
about the
"celebrate" part.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.920
Hey.

37:52.095 --> 37:54.315
So, I stopped by my house.

37:54.359 --> 37:55.621
Katie's gone.

37:55.664 --> 37:57.710
She packed her things.
No note.

38:02.236 --> 38:04.369
Our mom was an alcoholic.

38:04.412 --> 38:06.632
I spent high school
trying to stop her

38:06.675 --> 38:10.810
from drinking herself to death
while I was looking after Katie.

38:10.853 --> 38:12.725
Now Katie's...

38:12.768 --> 38:14.379
I'm losing her, too.

38:14.422 --> 38:16.729
You were right
to set boundaries.

38:16.772 --> 38:17.991
I don't know how to help.

38:18.034 --> 38:20.080
I haven't known you
for long, but one thing

38:20.123 --> 38:23.126
I know for sure is that you
know how to help people.

38:23.170 --> 38:24.345
You've even helped me.

38:24.389 --> 38:25.912
Even you?

38:25.955 --> 38:27.087
Mm-hmm.

38:27.130 --> 38:28.393
Hi. Sorry.

38:28.436 --> 38:30.090
Oh, hi. I'm just...
I was just...

38:30.133 --> 38:31.570
Do you want to...?
Why don't you...?

38:31.613 --> 38:33.006
Thank you.

38:39.447 --> 38:41.971
That's my ten-month
sobriety chip.

38:43.799 --> 38:47.194
You never... I had no idea that
you were going to meetings.

38:47.237 --> 38:50.328
I made it to ten months
and 14 days.

38:50.371 --> 38:52.155
Wow.

38:52.199 --> 38:55.942
And then two weeks ago,
I got fired.

38:55.985 --> 38:58.945
And the next day,
Trip dumped me...

39:01.339 --> 39:03.950
...for his mother's oncologist.

39:03.993 --> 39:07.954
The woman who cured
his mother's cancer

39:07.997 --> 39:09.825
and bought him a BMW.

39:09.869 --> 39:12.524
Wow, some men are
so easily swayed.

39:12.567 --> 39:14.264
I know.

39:14.308 --> 39:17.180
I fell off the wagon.

39:17.224 --> 39:19.661
Really hard.

39:19.705 --> 39:21.359
I was scared.

39:23.012 --> 39:25.406
I just needed to see you.

39:25.450 --> 39:27.190
Katie, I'm sorry.

39:27.234 --> 39:29.062
I didn't know how to help. I...

39:29.105 --> 39:31.673
You did. You did help.

39:31.717 --> 39:34.197
I needed a kick in the butt.
That's what I came for.

39:34.241 --> 39:35.460
That's-that's what I needed.

39:35.503 --> 39:38.027
I mean, I was spinning out, man.

39:38.071 --> 39:40.160
I mean, I...

39:42.423 --> 39:45.644
I went back this morning, and...

39:45.687 --> 39:48.690
when I go back to Boulder,
I'm gonna keep going.

39:51.301 --> 39:53.565
I want to start over.

39:53.608 --> 39:55.915
You make me want
to be a better person.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.266
You always have.
