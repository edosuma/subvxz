WEBVTT

00:02.385 --> 00:05.445
<i>Previously on Battlestar Galactica.</i>

00:43.759 --> 00:46.284
What the hell is
going on? You killed her.

00:46.362 --> 00:48.489
We gotta go. Right now.

00:49.432 --> 00:50.399
That's Tom Zarek.

00:50.466 --> 00:51.490
The terrorist?

00:51.567 --> 00:52.864
He's a prisoner
of conscience.

00:52.935 --> 00:54.061
He's a butcher.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.037
<i>He blew up a government building.</i>

00:56.105 --> 00:57.265
<i>There is no excuse for that.</i>

00:57.340 --> 00:59.001
I thought you said
you respected me.

00:59.108 --> 01:02.100
That was before you resorted
to violence and hostage-taking.

01:02.178 --> 01:04.976
<i>I demand the immediate resignation</i>

01:05.081 --> 01:07.379
<i>of Laura Roslin
and her ministers.</i>

01:07.483 --> 01:10.884
I demand free and open elections
to choose a new leadership.

01:10.987 --> 01:15.481
If you let the rest of these hostages
go, we will leave this ship in your hands.

01:24.233 --> 01:25.393
<i>Got it?</i>

01:25.468 --> 01:27.060
<i>Test. There.</i>

01:28.137 --> 01:30.662
Are we on?
Frack, we're on. Go.

01:31.374 --> 01:34.343
<i>Live from Cloud Nine, the
most luxurious ship in the fleet...</i>

01:34.410 --> 01:35.570
<i>it's The Colonial Gang.</i>

01:35.645 --> 01:37.772
It's a new talk show that
brings you the inside scoop...

01:37.847 --> 01:38.973
on the fleet's
movers and shakers.

01:39.048 --> 01:41.312
<i>I'm James McManus,
formerly of the Caprica Times.</i>

01:41.384 --> 01:43.648
With me are two of the only
remaining legitimate journalists...

01:43.719 --> 01:44.981
left in the universe.

01:45.054 --> 01:47.522
<i>Playa Palacios, veteran commentator
for the Picon Star Tribune.</i>

01:47.590 --> 01:48.614
Welcome.

01:48.691 --> 01:52.218
<i>And my wingman, Sekou Hamilton,
former editor of the Aerelon Gazette.</i>

01:52.328 --> 01:53.989
<i>As most people
probably know...</i>

01:54.063 --> 01:56.224
<i>Cloud Nine was damaged
during a Cylon attack...</i>

01:56.299 --> 01:57.596
<i>and had to be evacuated.</i>

01:57.667 --> 02:01.125
<i>With repairs now complete, President
Roslin has picked it as the site...</i>

02:01.204 --> 02:02.466
<i>for an historic gathering.</i>

02:02.538 --> 02:05.200
<i>It's the first meeting
of the interim Quorum of 12...</i>

02:05.274 --> 02:07.242
<i>which will coincide
with Colonial Day...</i>

02:07.310 --> 02:10.643
<i>the 52nd anniversary of the signing
of the Articles of Colonization.</i>

02:10.713 --> 02:12.146
<i>Playa, why don't you weigh in?</i>

02:12.215 --> 02:14.080
Laura Roslin
should be applauded...

02:14.150 --> 02:17.017
for restoring the system
of checks and balances.

02:17.086 --> 02:20.214
<i>Every delegate chosen
so far has been a Roslin crony.</i>

02:20.323 --> 02:22.154
<i>It's a puppet Quorum, okay?</i>

02:22.225 --> 02:26.423
That will rubber-stamp every edict
this power-mad schoolteacher will try...

02:26.529 --> 02:29.828
How can you say that when half the
Quorum hasn't even been selected yet?

02:29.899 --> 02:32.868
<i>I predict every last
one will be a Roslin lackey...</i>

02:32.935 --> 02:34.197
<i>hand-picked by the power...</i>

02:34.270 --> 02:36.670
<i>behind the throne, Presidential
Advisor Wallace Gray.</i>

02:36.739 --> 02:40.038
<i>Don't you see it? Gray orchestrated
this whole publicity stunt.</i>

02:40.109 --> 02:43.567
Come on, Jim. Wallace Gray
is no prince of darkness.

02:43.646 --> 02:44.772
I disagree.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.314
He's helped Roslin regulate
the internal economy...

02:47.383 --> 02:50.284
made sure vital food and medical
supplies were fairly distributed...

02:50.353 --> 02:53.345
He's a fatuous gasbag who's made
a fortune through kickback deals...

02:53.422 --> 02:54.889
<i>the members of this Quorum
have profited from.</i>

02:54.957 --> 02:55.787
Freedom
of the press.

02:55.858 --> 02:58.190
<i>As we speak...</i>

02:58.261 --> 03:02.721
Madam President, the fatuous gasbag
would like five minutes of your time.

03:02.798 --> 03:04.095
Wally.

03:06.068 --> 03:09.299
How does it feel to be a
celebrity? Well, I love it.

03:09.405 --> 03:11.839
They'll probably
be calling me a fascist next.

03:11.941 --> 03:14.705
No, I'm the fascist. You
stick with being the gasbag.

03:14.810 --> 03:18.371
Madam President, excuse me,
you're going to want to hear this.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.973
<i>Sagittaron have
chosen their delegate...</i>

03:21.050 --> 03:23.780
<i>for the Interim Quorum of 12.</i>

03:23.853 --> 03:25.650
<i>Who would've guessed it?
Tom Zarek.</i>

03:25.721 --> 03:28.485
Oh, my gods. He's got
quite a following out there.

03:28.557 --> 03:30.388
I should have
seen this coming.

03:30.459 --> 03:32.051
He's a terrorist.
Who are they kidding?

03:32.161 --> 03:33.628
<i>A ruthless terrorist.</i>

03:33.696 --> 03:37.757
<i>Tom Zarek incited a prison riot that
resulted in kidnapping, attempted rape.</i>

03:37.933 --> 03:40.993
He blew up a government building and
now he's gonna sit on the Quorum of 12?

03:41.070 --> 03:42.901
<i>Wrong.
It was a change that was...</i>

03:42.972 --> 03:44.872
<i>trumped up by the government
to discredit a man...</i>

03:44.940 --> 03:46.771
<i>who's dedicated his life
to the disenfranchised.</i>

03:46.842 --> 03:50.039
Yes? Just a moment.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.043
Commander Adama.
Why am I not surprised?

03:55.418 --> 03:56.476
Hello, Commander.

03:56.552 --> 03:57.883
<i>Are you listening to this?</i>

03:57.953 --> 03:58.942
Indeed.

03:59.021 --> 04:01.387
Can't allow a terrorist
to sit in government.

04:01.490 --> 04:02.718
<i>My hands are tied.</i>

04:02.792 --> 04:04.885
<i>I don't want
to turn him into a martyr.</i>

04:05.161 --> 04:08.221
Sagittaron law allows a prisoner
to regain his citizenship...

04:08.297 --> 04:09.924
once he's served his time.

04:09.999 --> 04:13.298
Tom Zarek represents
a danger to the entire fleet.

04:13.369 --> 04:17.100
<i>I can bar him from traveling to
Cloud Nine on that basis alone.</i>

04:17.173 --> 04:20.836
I perfectly understand the
threat Tom Zarek represents.

04:20.943 --> 04:25.437
But the last thing I need is for you to
start acting like my own personal goon squad.

04:25.514 --> 04:28.381
We need to let this play out.
Thank you.

04:30.519 --> 04:33.545
<i>Hold onto your shorts,
folks. Another's starting to develop.</i>

04:33.622 --> 04:35.783
<i>We're getting a live feed
from the Astral Queen.</i>

04:35.858 --> 04:38.258
<i>Tom Zarek
is about to make a statement.</i>

04:40.262 --> 04:42.321
Citizens of the 12 Colonies...

04:42.398 --> 04:44.923
I am humbled and moved
by this great honor.

04:45.668 --> 04:49.866
I will be a voice for those who
have gone too long unheard...

04:49.939 --> 04:53.807
by a government that serves only
the privileged and the powerful...

04:54.009 --> 04:57.501
that turns a blind eye to the
needs of the weak and the poor.

04:59.081 --> 05:03.415
But Roslin and her confederates
will no longer be able to ignore us.

05:04.120 --> 05:08.580
<i>People of the fleet, look up.
The winds of change are blowing.</i>

05:09.225 --> 05:12.388
<i>A new era is about to dawn.</i>

06:19.927 --> 06:21.087
Hey, Doc.

06:21.829 --> 06:24.889
Lt. Thrace, to what do
I owe this honor?

06:25.333 --> 06:29.326
<i>Our shuttle leaves for Cloud Nine
at 0512 tomorrow, so don't be late.</i>

06:29.403 --> 06:30.734
"Our" shuttle?

06:31.539 --> 06:34.030
A surprise getaway?
Just the two of you?

06:36.344 --> 06:38.312
I'm going to be handling
your security.

06:38.379 --> 06:40.745
Please don't touch that.
Thank you.

06:41.449 --> 06:44.680
Security of what?
You haven't heard?

06:45.787 --> 06:47.721
It's all over
talk wireless.

06:48.089 --> 06:51.024
When would I have the chance
to listen to the talk wireless?

06:51.092 --> 06:53.526
I have 60 years
of work in front of me.

06:53.694 --> 06:58.393
Anyway, talk wireless is just an excuse,
really, for lowbrow rabble-rousing.

06:59.433 --> 07:03.233
You've been selected as Caprica's
delegate to the Quorum of 12.

07:03.304 --> 07:04.532
Me?

07:07.909 --> 07:10.070
Is this
some kind of joke?

07:10.545 --> 07:14.140
Guess you got the super-genius
vote. No accounting for taste.

07:14.448 --> 07:17.611
Congratulations, Doctor.
Thank you.

07:20.555 --> 07:23.956
Politics is the only thing
more boring than blood samples.

07:24.058 --> 07:28.518
All those interminable
speeches. All that dreary pomp.

07:29.764 --> 07:33.530
Parties full of young women
drawn to men of power.

07:35.770 --> 07:38.739
But when the people call,
you must serve.

07:43.644 --> 07:45.839
<i>I can't remember the last time...</i>

07:45.913 --> 07:47.710
<i>I felt the sunlight
on my face.</i>

07:48.416 --> 07:51.544
Sure feels good.
Almost like the real thing.

07:56.791 --> 08:00.283
They could've done a
better job with the horizon, though.

08:02.330 --> 08:04.355
Security's going
to be a bitch.

08:04.866 --> 08:07.858
A thousand different places
for a sniper to hide.

08:07.969 --> 08:09.800
How many people
are we dealing with, again?

08:09.871 --> 08:11.702
Five hundred plus.

08:11.806 --> 08:15.708
Each colony's sending a
delegation of leading citizens.

08:15.810 --> 08:19.871
Great. Herds of lookie-loos,
any one of whom could be a Cylon.

08:20.481 --> 08:22.278
Toasters aren't
our only problem.

08:22.350 --> 08:24.784
Don't you pay
any attention to politics?

08:24.852 --> 08:27.286
No.
A lot of unrest out there.

08:28.656 --> 08:31.557
So why is Roslin insisting on
letting so many people come?

08:31.659 --> 08:33.854
I guess she thinks
it's important for them...

08:33.928 --> 08:36.396
to be able to observe
how their government works.

08:36.530 --> 08:39.988
So basically, she's already
running for re-election.

08:40.501 --> 08:41.729
No, Kara.

08:43.037 --> 08:45.267
Kara, give me that.

09:00.021 --> 09:02.455
Thank you, sir.
Enjoy your day.

09:03.257 --> 09:04.815
The atmosphere is electric...

09:04.892 --> 09:07.156
as Quorum members arrive
with their delegations.

09:07.561 --> 09:09.358
<i>I'm outside
the Cloud Nine Ballroom...</i>

09:09.430 --> 09:12.024
where the reception of the new
Quorum of 12 is about to take place.

09:12.099 --> 09:13.589
But the question
on everyone's mind is:

09:13.668 --> 09:17.126
Will President Roslin shake the hand of
the man many still regard as a terrorist...

09:17.438 --> 09:21.397
or will she snub him, and, by
extension, all the people of Sagittaron?

09:22.910 --> 09:24.275
Col. Tigh.

09:25.279 --> 09:27.770
My wife Ellen.
Welcome aboard.

09:28.416 --> 09:30.077
Kill me now.

09:31.319 --> 09:32.684
Col. Tigh.

09:40.594 --> 09:42.391
Starbuck, Apollo.
Zarek's here.

09:42.463 --> 09:43.691
Copy.

09:43.798 --> 09:47.199
Don't worry. This guy's mine
the second he makes a wrong move.

09:47.301 --> 09:50.429
<i>Yeah? Well, you'll
have to beat me to him.</i>

09:51.973 --> 09:54.771
Murderer. You don't belong
here, Zarek. Go back.

09:54.842 --> 09:58.175
What did you say? He's not a
murderer, he's a freedom fighter.

09:58.279 --> 10:00.304
All right?
Excuse me.

10:01.182 --> 10:02.774
May I see
your security pass, sir?

10:02.850 --> 10:04.249
Not a problem.

10:04.318 --> 10:07.651
I'm a citizen of Sagittaron. I've
got every legal right to be here.

10:07.722 --> 10:10.020
Your rights don't extend to
roughing people up.

10:10.091 --> 10:14.653
<i>Lay a hand on anyone else and you'll
be getting to know Galactica's brig.</i>

10:14.729 --> 10:18.256
<i>Well, everything's in order.
Enjoy your stay on Cloud Nine.</i>

10:18.366 --> 10:19.765
Oh, I will.

10:26.007 --> 10:27.702
Tom Zarek.

10:27.775 --> 10:30.005
<i>Col. Tigh,
Battlestar Galactica.</i>

10:31.712 --> 10:32.940
I see.

10:35.883 --> 10:37.180
My wife.

10:38.185 --> 10:41.120
Does she have a name?
Ellen.

10:43.090 --> 10:46.253
Call me Tom. I don't
like to stand on ceremony.

10:46.360 --> 10:49.022
I'm the same way. All this
pretension makes me sick.

10:49.096 --> 10:50.586
You're holding up
the line.

10:54.001 --> 10:56.231
Thank you for making me
feel welcome, Ellen.

10:56.303 --> 10:58.328
I hope to see you again.

11:00.141 --> 11:01.972
Why did you
do that?

11:03.911 --> 11:05.469
To get our picture
on the front page...

11:05.579 --> 11:08.605
of every half-baked newsletter
and photo service in the fleet.

11:08.682 --> 11:10.775
I don't need my picture
taken with a terrorist.

11:10.851 --> 11:13.479
Wake up, Saul.
Look at these cameras.

11:16.757 --> 11:20.921
Roslin's the past, Zarek's the
future. A blind man can see that.

11:25.032 --> 11:27.364
Madam President.
Mr. Zarek.

11:29.437 --> 11:32.804
If I were to offer you
my hand in friendship...

11:33.808 --> 11:35.241
would you take it?

11:35.543 --> 11:37.977
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

11:47.388 --> 11:49.913
That was nicely played.
Thank you.

11:50.191 --> 11:53.592
Just remember, I'm not
your enemy, Madam President.

11:54.829 --> 11:58.993
And I know today's agenda
is rather large...

11:59.533 --> 12:02.991
but I think that if you'll look
at the scheduled meetings...

12:03.070 --> 12:06.233
you'll see that they concern
issues vital to the fleet.

12:06.340 --> 12:08.865
In some cases,
existing policies...

12:08.943 --> 12:12.674
regarding matters such as the
distribution of medical supplies...

12:12.746 --> 12:15.977
You're missing
an intriguing opportunity.

12:17.585 --> 12:20.110
Playa's not wearing
any underwear.

12:20.454 --> 12:22.115
Don't be absurd.

12:25.259 --> 12:26.487
Really?

12:28.562 --> 12:30.792
She's been
eyeing you all afternoon.

12:40.341 --> 12:42.400
She's only human.

12:44.745 --> 12:46.508
You're not jealous?

12:46.814 --> 12:48.782
Love isn't about sex,
Gaius.

12:48.849 --> 12:51.477
There's an enlightened
point of view.

12:51.752 --> 12:53.344
I've been thinking...

12:54.288 --> 12:57.485
and as far as I'm concerned
you can have any woman you want.

12:57.725 --> 12:59.659
But always remember...

13:00.628 --> 13:02.357
I have your heart.

13:03.998 --> 13:05.898
Yes. Of course you do.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.792
I can always rip it out
of your chest if I need to.

13:11.872 --> 13:14.500
So if there are no objections...

13:14.575 --> 13:19.308
the Chair will entertain motions to
accept today's agenda as proposed.

13:19.380 --> 13:21.314
I have an objection.

13:24.685 --> 13:26.846
The chair recognizes
Sagittaron.

13:26.921 --> 13:30.482
All the items on your agenda
are important, I agree.

13:30.925 --> 13:36.295
Ration distribution, education,
medical services, all very important.

13:36.363 --> 13:38.524
But I'm frankly shocked
to discover...

13:38.599 --> 13:41.625
the most critical issue of all
is nowhere to be found.

13:41.735 --> 13:45.796
Really? Well, perhaps
Mr. Zarek could enlighten us.

13:46.574 --> 13:49.099
The election
of a vice-president.

13:49.643 --> 13:53.272
If, gods forbid, anything should
happen to you, Madam President...

13:53.380 --> 13:55.814
we have
no designated successor.

13:56.150 --> 13:59.586
The civilian branch of our
government would be paralyzed...

13:59.653 --> 14:03.282
leaving the door wide open
for a military dictatorship.

14:03.657 --> 14:07.753
Sagittaron moves that the first
item on the Quorum's agenda...

14:08.429 --> 14:11.330
should be nominations
for vice-president.

14:14.068 --> 14:15.558
Second.

14:17.104 --> 14:20.005
Second.
Second.

14:28.182 --> 14:31.640
Caprica seconds
for various reasons...

14:32.353 --> 14:36.289
which are far too obvious and
numerous to go into right now.

14:36.757 --> 14:41.751
But certainly, I think we can all agree
that it'd be a good idea to have a successor.

14:43.664 --> 14:46.189
The motion has been
moved and seconded.

14:46.467 --> 14:51.427
All those in favor of opening nominations
for the vice-presidency, say aye.

14:52.206 --> 14:53.230
Aye.

14:53.340 --> 14:54.398
Aye.

14:54.742 --> 14:56.141
The ayes have it.

14:56.210 --> 15:00.237
The floor is now open for nominations.
The chair recognizes Virgon.

15:01.548 --> 15:04.108
Now, there is
only one man here...

15:04.218 --> 15:08.450
who is willing to work for the
betterment of the people in this fleet.

15:08.622 --> 15:10.556
When I asked for his help...

15:11.558 --> 15:14.959
he sent a crew to fix the air
filtration system on my ship...

15:15.029 --> 15:18.658
and, hell, they were finished and they
were gone while I was still waiting...

15:18.732 --> 15:21.860
for the President's office
to return my call.

15:22.136 --> 15:24.536
I nominate Tom Zarek.

15:26.140 --> 15:27.732
Thanks.

15:32.479 --> 15:34.242
Is there a second?

15:34.715 --> 15:37.081
Gemenon seconds
the nomination.

15:37.418 --> 15:41.582
The nomination of Tom Zarek for the
vice-presidency has been accepted.

15:43.157 --> 15:48.060
The Chair will remain open
for 72 hours for nominations.

15:49.363 --> 15:51.331
The session is now adjourned.

16:05.477 --> 16:09.277
Thomas Zarek is not
going to be my vice-president.

16:09.615 --> 16:11.640
Six months until
the presidential election.

16:11.717 --> 16:13.275
We could've handpicked
a candidate.

16:13.352 --> 16:15.752
It didn't shock me
when Bagot nominated him.

16:15.821 --> 16:18.619
But Porter, that was
surprising. Not really.

16:18.691 --> 16:21.854
The Gemenon ships use more water per
capita than any other ships in the fleet.

16:21.927 --> 16:23.394
She wanted more rations,
I said no.

16:23.863 --> 16:26.457
Zarek may have made some new
friends in the last few weeks...

16:26.532 --> 16:28.523
but there are still plenty of
people out there who hate him.

16:28.601 --> 16:30.762
Don't underestimate Zarek.

16:31.503 --> 16:33.869
He's charismatic and knows
what buttons to push.

16:33.939 --> 16:37.932
<i>Frankly, Madam President, I am concerned
about the security aboard Cloud Nine.</i>

16:38.010 --> 16:40.274
I want you leaning
forward on this, Captain.

16:40.346 --> 16:43.076
If they so much as sneeze,
they better have a handkerchief.

16:43.148 --> 16:44.638
Understood.

16:48.387 --> 16:49.979
We need a candidate.

16:50.055 --> 16:52.683
Someone who will quickly
win the delegates' support.

16:52.791 --> 16:54.622
An established name.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.231
I'm not a politician.

17:02.334 --> 17:04.165
But you know
how to get things done.

17:04.236 --> 17:06.727
You've kept this fleet
functioning all this time.

17:06.939 --> 17:09.999
No. Thanks, but...

17:14.246 --> 17:19.206
I cannot allow Tom Zarek to be one
heartbeat away from the presidency, Wally.

17:20.853 --> 17:22.343
I need you.

17:26.492 --> 17:28.426
You've got me,
Madam President.

17:29.295 --> 17:33.322
How can you reassure people that you're
looking out for their interests...

17:33.399 --> 17:36.129
as opposed to the
rehabilitation of Tom Zarek?

17:36.235 --> 17:38.999
That's a great question,
Playa. This is how I see it.

17:39.071 --> 17:43.269
We're facing a situation
so unique, so specific...

17:43.909 --> 17:46.935
that I believe we need not
only new leadership...

17:47.012 --> 17:49.378
but a whole new
way of thinking.

17:49.448 --> 17:51.712
Like blowing up
a building or two?

17:51.984 --> 17:54.544
If things weren't so serious,
I'd say that was funny.

17:54.620 --> 17:58.056
Look, there's no economy.
There's no market. No industry.

17:58.123 --> 18:00.489
No capital.
Money is worthless.

18:01.026 --> 18:04.792
And yet, we're all held hostage by
the idea of the way things used to be.

18:04.863 --> 18:06.330
Look where we are.

18:07.099 --> 18:10.068
This man wakes up
every morning...

18:10.336 --> 18:13.931
tugs on his boots and goes
to work in this garden.

18:14.406 --> 18:18.308
<i>Why? Because
it's his job? What job?</i>

18:18.477 --> 18:21.207
<i>He labors, but he gets
no benefit from his labor.</i>

18:21.447 --> 18:22.778
<i>And he's not the only one.</i>

18:22.848 --> 18:26.807
Many of us are just still going
through the motions of our old lives.

18:27.019 --> 18:30.284
The lawyers still act like
lawyers, but they have no clients.

18:30.356 --> 18:33.814
<i>Businessmen still act like
businessmen, but have no business.</i>

18:34.093 --> 18:39.053
President Roslin and her policies
are all about holding on to a fantasy.

18:40.599 --> 18:44.467
<i>If we want to survive, we need to
completely restructure our lives.</i>

18:44.536 --> 18:47.369
We need to think about
the community of citizens.

18:47.439 --> 18:49.771
The group, not the individual.

18:50.342 --> 18:55.405
We need to completely free ourselves
of the past and operate as a collective.

18:56.582 --> 19:00.279
You're not interested in the
citizens. You just want power.

19:00.386 --> 19:02.286
Turn that crap off.

19:05.391 --> 19:07.689
I was listening
to that broadcast.

19:07.893 --> 19:09.485
You again?

19:10.462 --> 19:12.020
That's a shame.

19:12.331 --> 19:15.732
They all want to hear Mr. Zarek
speak, too. Don't you, buddy?

19:15.801 --> 19:17.632
See? He wants to hear
Mr. Zarek.

19:17.736 --> 19:20.796
How about you? You want to
hear what Mr. Zarek has to say?

19:20.906 --> 19:22.635
I don't mind
one way or the other.

19:22.741 --> 19:24.834
Well, I take that
as a yes. So turn it on.

19:24.910 --> 19:26.639
Now.
Leave it.

19:27.413 --> 19:31.372
Mr. Zarek is a representative of
the people and we are the people.

19:31.717 --> 19:34.845
Well, you're people. Sort of.

19:35.087 --> 19:37.385
You know, I don't like
your tone, flyboy, so...

19:37.456 --> 19:42.189
why don't you just move along out of
here and go enjoy the imitation weather?

19:43.529 --> 19:46.225
I'd be happy to,
after you leave.

19:49.134 --> 19:50.658
Which is now.

19:53.972 --> 19:55.303
Okay.

19:56.208 --> 19:58.176
Don't want no trouble.

20:02.147 --> 20:03.512
What the hell.

20:46.992 --> 20:48.323
There's a gun.

20:52.731 --> 20:54.392
Starbuck.

20:56.401 --> 20:58.164
Incoming.

21:08.614 --> 21:10.411
Are you
looking for this?

21:23.728 --> 21:27.528
The Telamont Building's still
standing. That's Delphi, all right.

21:33.404 --> 21:36.498
Now, all we have to
do is wait until dark...

21:37.375 --> 21:41.209
infiltrate the most heavily fortified
military hub on this planet...

21:41.679 --> 21:44.978
hope the Cylons haven't
completely wasted the spaceport...

21:45.249 --> 21:49.185
<i>steal a ship, locate Galactica and fly
to her without getting shot to hell.</i>

21:49.253 --> 21:51.050
Is that all?
Yeah.

21:53.491 --> 21:55.391
I guess we can
relax until dark.

21:55.459 --> 21:57.359
Might as well make
ourselves comfortable.

21:57.428 --> 21:59.293
You hungry?

22:00.264 --> 22:02.164
No, not right now.

22:05.603 --> 22:08.299
Your stomach's feeling better?
Starving.

22:09.507 --> 22:13.671
I've been trying to make sense out of
the two women we saw with the Cylons.

22:14.578 --> 22:15.670
And?

22:17.348 --> 22:20.317
I can't fathom why anybody
would wanna help the toasters.

22:20.584 --> 22:22.677
And they just
happened to be twins?

22:23.888 --> 22:25.446
That's too weird.

22:26.657 --> 22:28.955
You got
a better explanation?

22:32.696 --> 22:35.790
You think the Cylons could
be messing with human DNA?

22:36.467 --> 22:38.628
Cloning people
or something?

22:42.006 --> 22:43.701
Could be.

22:44.508 --> 22:47.375
That would explain
how they took us by surprise.

22:47.478 --> 22:50.845
They had these replicated humans
infiltrating the colonies...

22:50.915 --> 22:53.611
laying the groundwork
for the surprise attack.

22:58.923 --> 23:01.721
You know, if they
were human clones...

23:02.726 --> 23:07.595
that means they're capable of
complex emotions, maybe even love.

23:07.898 --> 23:10.662
Maybe they were misguided in the
way that they were indoctrinated.

23:10.734 --> 23:12.497
Whatever they are,
they're not human.

23:12.570 --> 23:14.970
No human could do
the things they've done.

23:15.039 --> 23:17.234
They killed
billions of innocent people.

23:21.912 --> 23:25.905
They've got to be fracking
Cylons, just like the rest of them.

23:29.954 --> 23:32.149
Why do you have
a summit itinerary?

23:32.957 --> 23:36.290
Why circle every public
appearance by President Roslin?

23:37.628 --> 23:38.959
It's not mine.

23:39.063 --> 23:40.553
So what? Some stranger
wandered down the hall...

23:40.631 --> 23:43.429
picked the lock to your room
and just left it there?

23:44.301 --> 23:47.202
False-bottom with anechoic
coating to absorb x-rays.

23:47.271 --> 23:48.704
Ceramic stealth gun.

23:48.772 --> 23:52.105
You sure went through a lot of
trouble to get that weapon onboard.

23:52.176 --> 23:55.111
I carry a lot of money.
I need protection.

23:55.179 --> 23:56.737
Right.

23:57.114 --> 24:00.606
The money's worthless. Your
friend Zarek pointed that out.

24:01.252 --> 24:03.311
I don't even know Zarek.

24:05.122 --> 24:09.149
Your pal Grimes says
different. He gave you up.

24:14.331 --> 24:17.323
You're bluffing.
You haven't got anything.

24:17.568 --> 24:19.661
We don't need anything,
Valance.

24:22.740 --> 24:27.040
Because this isn't a trial. This
is just you and us in this room.

24:28.012 --> 24:31.539
Like Zarek pointed out, we're
living in a whole new world.

24:31.749 --> 24:33.341
There's no due process.

24:34.818 --> 24:36.809
This is your courtroom.

24:38.589 --> 24:43.492
And that would make
us your executioners.

24:44.061 --> 24:45.961
So you might want to cooperate...

24:46.030 --> 24:48.157
or else you're going
out an airlock.

24:48.232 --> 24:50.598
Because that's what
we do to traitors.

24:51.902 --> 24:53.699
Look, I...

24:56.440 --> 24:59.466
I just came over here
for the booze and the food.

24:59.577 --> 25:00.976
That's it.

25:01.211 --> 25:03.042
You know what?
Frack you!

25:04.848 --> 25:06.975
We put all the heat
on Valance that we could...

25:07.051 --> 25:08.518
and we still
can't tie him to Zarek.

25:08.586 --> 25:11.111
I know Zarek's behind this.
Keep working on Valance.

25:11.188 --> 25:12.177
We will.
But to be safe...

25:12.256 --> 25:14.952
I think you should send the entire
Sagittaron delegation back to their ships.

25:15.025 --> 25:18.358
Can't do that. Violates their civil
rights. Plays right into Zarek's hands.

25:18.429 --> 25:20.488
<i>But he could still have
another shooter on Cloud Nine...</i>

25:20.564 --> 25:23.055
and if Zarek wins the vote,
he's more than capable...

25:23.133 --> 25:26.569
of ordering your assassination
and ascending to the presidency.

25:26.704 --> 25:29.798
Zarek's not going to win
because I'm not going to let him.

25:29.873 --> 25:32.433
Meanwhile, you're going to
keep Zarek under surveillance.

25:32.509 --> 25:34.977
You're going to tap his phones,
you're going to bug his room.

25:35.045 --> 25:39.982
If you find anything that remotely
connects Zarek to Valance, shut him down.

25:41.685 --> 25:45.587
<i>The domestic policies we've been talking
about over the last little while...</i>

25:45.656 --> 25:49.456
<i>such as employment,
and housing, and education...</i>

25:49.960 --> 25:53.691
Latest vote count is seven
for Gray, five for Zarek.

25:54.999 --> 25:57.331
We're slipping.
He was four an hour ago.

25:57.401 --> 26:00.837
Zarek must be making
promises. Picon flipped.

26:02.072 --> 26:05.735
We've got to hold the colonies
till they vote tomorrow.

26:05.843 --> 26:08.505
<i>On Page 33 of
my mission statement...</i>

26:08.579 --> 26:11.480
<i>I lay out a 16-point
educational program...</i>

26:11.548 --> 26:13.675
<i>that the President and I
have developed.</i>

26:13.751 --> 26:16.777
<i>Individuals with four-year
college degrees will be eligible.</i>

26:16.854 --> 26:19.118
Hi. How are you doing?
Remember me?

26:19.890 --> 26:22.916
We got Valance.
And you're next.

26:26.263 --> 26:28.527
<i>Health care.
It's one thing to talk...</i>

26:34.605 --> 26:37.938
Can I get you something?
So you work here now?

26:38.609 --> 26:41.442
Why should I ask the
bartender to get me a drink?

26:41.545 --> 26:43.945
What's in it for him?
A big tip.

26:45.382 --> 26:47.179
What would he
spend on?

26:47.751 --> 26:49.844
So, are you worried
about Wallace Gray?

26:49.920 --> 26:52.320
I hear he's ahead
in the vote count.

26:52.756 --> 26:55.623
Whatever the people
want is fine by me.

26:56.460 --> 27:00.055
Everyone has an agenda.
I know I do.

27:00.164 --> 27:02.155
And what would
that be?

27:03.467 --> 27:07.927
The same as yours, Tom.
Me. Myself.

27:08.372 --> 27:11.603
And I.

27:14.978 --> 27:19.415
You are clearly a well-connected,
well-informed woman.

27:21.985 --> 27:24.681
Wife of the XO.
For whatever that's worth.

27:25.856 --> 27:29.485
Quite a bit.
Now and in the future.

27:29.860 --> 27:33.387
That's what I'm interested in,
Tom. My place...

27:34.431 --> 27:38.527
and my husband's place
in the future.

27:39.069 --> 27:40.661
Okay.

27:41.905 --> 27:46.274
I'm looking for a friend of
mine. His name is Valance.

27:55.085 --> 27:57.178
How the hell
did this happen?

27:57.387 --> 27:59.548
We've got to get
to the President.

28:09.599 --> 28:11.499
<i>We're here
with Dr. Gaius Baltar...</i>

28:11.568 --> 28:12.728
<i>representative of Caprica.</i>

28:12.802 --> 28:14.235
<i>Dr. Baltar,
I have one question.</i>

28:14.304 --> 28:16.465
<i>Is President Roslin's
political career terminal</i>

28:16.539 --> 28:18.336
<i>or is there hope
of resuscitating it?</i>

28:18.508 --> 28:21.306
Laura Roslin's political
career is very much alive...

28:21.377 --> 28:24.175
and to underestimate her would
be a very serious mistake.

28:24.280 --> 28:26.077
You miss the limelight,
don't you, Gaius?

28:26.449 --> 28:28.246
Yes, I have.

28:28.318 --> 28:30.878
You have what, Dr. Baltar?
Nothing. You were saying?

28:30.954 --> 28:34.720
You seriously believe
that this schoolteacher...

28:34.791 --> 28:37.191
is able to handle
the job of presidency?

28:37.293 --> 28:41.024
His wrists were slashed with
broken glass from the room.

28:41.097 --> 28:43.565
So was it suicide
or was it murder?

28:44.300 --> 28:46.029
It wasn't suicide.

28:46.102 --> 28:49.128
Zarek had him killed.
If only we could prove that.

28:49.205 --> 28:50.763
How'd they get past
the Marine Guards?

28:50.840 --> 28:52.137
Through the vent.

28:52.275 --> 28:53.640
<i>I'm glad to hear it...</i>

28:53.710 --> 28:55.200
<i>because all of us have had
teachers</i>

28:55.278 --> 28:57.439
<i>who've made a profound
impact on our lives.</i>

28:57.514 --> 29:00.711
History is full of
examples of leaders...

29:00.817 --> 29:03.411
who have come from
the most humble beginnings...

29:03.620 --> 29:07.283
and have risen to meet the challenge
posed by cataclysmic events.

29:07.357 --> 29:10.349
How many people knew
where Valance was being held?

29:10.593 --> 29:13.391
Just the people in this room
plus two Marines.

29:13.463 --> 29:14.987
<i>...criticize Laura Roslin...</i>

29:15.064 --> 29:17.328
<i>and the tough decisions that
she has to make every day.</i>

29:17.400 --> 29:19.868
<i>Especially, if you're someone
like Tom Zarek...</i>

29:19.936 --> 29:23.463
<i>who's never shouldered any real
responsibility in your life.</i>

29:23.540 --> 29:26.566
To be fair to Tom, how could he? He's
been in prison for the last 20 years.

29:26.676 --> 29:29.304
And now that he's had a
drastic personality makeover...

29:29.379 --> 29:33.042
he's posing like he's the
savior to all your ills.

29:33.650 --> 29:35.208
I think you all
have a short memory.

29:35.652 --> 29:37.279
Well,
someone talked.

29:37.921 --> 29:41.880
And now we have no assassin,
no evidence of a plot...

29:42.158 --> 29:46.254
no check on Zarek,
no nothing.

29:46.796 --> 29:49.697
If he can get to Valance,
he can get to anyone.

29:50.033 --> 29:53.867
Madam President, he will definitely
try and take a shot at you now.

29:54.470 --> 29:56.131
Only if he wins the vote.

29:56.205 --> 30:00.574
What I have to say is,
we must survive.

30:01.844 --> 30:03.709
<i>And we will survive.</i>

30:04.347 --> 30:08.647
And we will do so through the values
that have made our colonies great.

30:08.718 --> 30:12.085
Courage. Truth.
Justice. Liberty.

30:13.756 --> 30:17.283
With a firm and deep resolve
to make tomorrow better.

30:17.427 --> 30:21.158
Not just for ourselves,
but for our children.

30:23.967 --> 30:27.698
Madam President, I still worry the
vote may be trending against you.

30:27.770 --> 30:29.169
Yes, it is.

30:29.706 --> 30:31.765
But I'm going to win
this thing.

30:32.508 --> 30:36.171
And Tom Zarek is going back to
his prison ship where he belongs.

30:36.245 --> 30:39.442
But first I have two very
unpleasant duties to perform.

30:39.616 --> 30:42.016
<i>I need a shuttle
to Cloud Nine.</i>

30:45.989 --> 30:48.116
What am I
supposed to say?

30:50.493 --> 30:52.051
Health reasons.

30:52.829 --> 30:55.354
Oh, right, fine.
Health reasons.

30:55.932 --> 30:58.366
You know,
all those years...

30:59.035 --> 31:02.903
I watched you
working with Adar.

31:03.272 --> 31:06.173
You were always
so quiet, so polite...

31:06.709 --> 31:08.609
so dignified.

31:09.579 --> 31:14.073
I never thought you'd fit in with the
bare-knuckle, backstabbing politicians.

31:15.952 --> 31:17.852
I guess I was wrong.

31:33.770 --> 31:35.203
All clear.

31:37.707 --> 31:40.301
Dr. Baltar?
Are you in here?

31:48.518 --> 31:50.452
Madam President?

31:56.693 --> 32:01.130
I heard you on the wireless. You
were very articulate, quite engaging.

32:01.330 --> 32:03.025
Oh, thank you.

32:03.199 --> 32:05.224
That's very encouraging.

32:05.334 --> 32:10.067
Yeah, I was just trying to do my bit as
the elected representative of Caprica.

32:11.374 --> 32:13.365
Besides...

32:13.843 --> 32:17.279
I'm beginning to get
a real feel for politics.

32:19.182 --> 32:22.310
So I take it you're
not voting for Mr. Zarek?

32:22.985 --> 32:26.079
Any man who uses their intelligence
and resources to blow up a building...

32:26.155 --> 32:27.986
doesn't get my vote, no.

32:28.357 --> 32:31.986
No, I'm voting for your man
Gray. He's really gray...

32:33.496 --> 32:37.023
He's great. He is great.
Which is why he's got my vote.

32:37.900 --> 32:39.492
Unfortunately...

32:39.569 --> 32:42.629
Mr. Gray
dropped out of the race.

32:42.772 --> 32:44.330
Then who do you
want me to vote for?

32:44.640 --> 32:46.835
I was thinking you.

32:46.909 --> 32:48.433
Me?

32:49.879 --> 32:52.677
Look... Doctor, let's cut to the chase.

32:54.450 --> 32:57.544
You're a very popular man
these days.

32:57.620 --> 33:00.783
I would be fortunate
to have your intellect...

33:01.190 --> 33:04.990
and your popularity
right by my side.

33:06.896 --> 33:09.558
Under those circumstances,
I accept.

33:15.171 --> 33:17.867
Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you.

33:26.682 --> 33:30.243
Wow. What are you
going to do now?

33:31.020 --> 33:32.317
Now...

33:35.158 --> 33:37.752
Now I'm going to give you
an exclusive.

33:39.195 --> 33:40.958
After you.

33:48.905 --> 33:52.671
So what are we supposed to do? Sit
on our hands and watch her get killed?

33:52.742 --> 33:56.872
Zarek's too smart to take another shot
at the President during the summit.

33:56.979 --> 34:00.073
If he wins the vote,
he can take her out later...

34:00.316 --> 34:02.807
when everyone's forgotten
about Valance.

34:03.519 --> 34:06.249
He'll just bide his time
to find a better opportunity.

34:06.355 --> 34:07.549
That's great.

34:09.725 --> 34:12.660
Anyway, she says she's
not going to lose the vote.

34:12.862 --> 34:14.955
She says a lot of things.

34:17.934 --> 34:19.902
Don't you think
you should wash that?

34:19.969 --> 34:21.561
I did.

34:22.104 --> 34:23.833
Like when,
a month ago?

34:23.973 --> 34:26.066
Do you have a problem
with my hygiene?

34:26.442 --> 34:27.932
You have hygiene?

34:28.811 --> 34:31.302
I clean up good sometimes,
all right?

34:31.881 --> 34:34.372
Well, let me know
when it's one of those times.

34:38.120 --> 34:41.089
Tauron, Gaius Baltar.

34:42.959 --> 34:44.927
The surprises just keep on coming.

34:44.994 --> 34:48.225
A number of the Quorum delegates
have now shifted their support...

34:48.297 --> 34:49.730
to the scientific genius.

34:49.799 --> 34:53.166
A man who is credited with saving
the fleet on numerous occasions.

34:53.269 --> 34:55.464
At this point, Jim,
it is anyone's guess...

34:55.538 --> 34:59.838
as to who's going to win. But
my money is on Gaius. Dr. Baltar.

35:01.677 --> 35:04.271
Aquaria, Thomas Zarek.

35:12.488 --> 35:13.921
Aerelon.

35:18.327 --> 35:19.692
Tom Zarek.

35:20.463 --> 35:23.694
<i>The vote is now
six-five in favor of Tom Zarek.</i>

35:23.833 --> 35:26.358
<i>The next vote will determine
our new vice-president.</i>

35:26.435 --> 35:28.266
<i>If Zarek gets it, he wins.</i>

35:28.504 --> 35:32.941
<i>In the event of a tie, the President
will cast the deciding vote.</i>

35:45.354 --> 35:46.821
Citizens!

35:46.923 --> 35:50.859
I give you your new
vice-president, Dr. Gaius Baltar.

36:03.940 --> 36:06.875
The perks of power,
Mr. Vice-President.

36:07.376 --> 36:09.867
We're going to do
great things together.

36:10.146 --> 36:12.273
Good.
It's difficult to fathom.

36:12.481 --> 36:14.711
I never aspired to power.

36:14.784 --> 36:18.117
Of course you didn't, Gaius.
But someone had to step up.

36:18.220 --> 36:21.212
Well, after what Laura told me... Laura?

36:21.490 --> 36:24.050
Yeah, we're on
a first name basis now.

36:24.126 --> 36:29.120
Now look, I think
the people need me.

36:29.932 --> 36:31.331
Excuse us.

36:44.213 --> 36:45.373
So...

36:45.614 --> 36:48.412
that bum knee of yours
is looking pretty good.

36:50.119 --> 36:52.644
And the other one's
not too bad, either.

36:52.722 --> 36:56.556
Lee, if you want to ask me
to dance, just ask.

36:59.962 --> 37:01.725
You want to dance?

37:02.798 --> 37:05.699
Me in a dress is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

37:11.440 --> 37:14.170
Madam President.
Mr. Zarek.

37:14.276 --> 37:17.712
Oh, don't worry,
I won't be kissing you today.

37:19.348 --> 37:20.975
That's a shame.

37:21.083 --> 37:24.883
I shaved very closely in
anticipation of being smacked by you.

37:25.921 --> 37:29.049
That was
very nicely played.

37:29.859 --> 37:31.121
Again.

37:32.261 --> 37:35.196
But there's still a presidential
election in six months.

37:35.264 --> 37:38.290
I'll see you then.
I have no doubt.

37:38.367 --> 37:40.858
Oh, one thing
you should know.

37:43.172 --> 37:45.265
I didn't kill Valance.

37:46.809 --> 37:48.970
I wonder who did?

38:19.375 --> 38:22.276
Madam President,
good evening.

38:24.313 --> 38:26.804
I thought you
hated these things.

38:27.383 --> 38:31.752
It's Colonial Day. Where else
would I be? I'm a patriot.

38:32.822 --> 38:35.347
You really are,
aren't you?

38:37.093 --> 38:41.120
Dr. Baltar. Interesting choice.

38:42.064 --> 38:46.330
I figured,
the devil you know.

38:46.869 --> 38:50.396
Politics.
As exciting as war.

38:50.906 --> 38:52.840
Definitely as dangerous.

38:53.008 --> 38:57.707
Though in war,
you only get killed once.

38:59.482 --> 39:03.612
In politics,
it can happen over and over.

39:04.787 --> 39:06.721
You're still standing.

39:08.591 --> 39:10.081
So are you.

39:10.159 --> 39:12.150
And I can dance.

39:40.356 --> 39:44.622
I have a surprise for you.
Should I be worried?

39:47.863 --> 39:50.058
Not unless
you consider a day...

39:50.132 --> 39:54.000
<i>in a luxury suite
aboard the Rising Star...</i>

39:54.069 --> 39:55.730
as something
to be worried about.

39:55.804 --> 39:58.739
What?
How did you swing that?

39:59.341 --> 40:01.036
I have my ways.

40:06.348 --> 40:08.407
What you need to do...

40:08.551 --> 40:12.647
is figure out a way to get slave-driving
Bill to give you the day off.

40:12.721 --> 40:14.518
Yeah.

40:15.090 --> 40:20.027
And while we're there, we might
want to talk to a few people...

40:20.329 --> 40:23.264
about your future.
What?

40:25.601 --> 40:29.128
Later, my love.
It can all wait until later.

40:41.584 --> 40:43.176
Any second now.

40:46.288 --> 40:49.689
If we get caught...
If anything happens...

40:49.758 --> 40:52.192
You don't have to
say anything. I know.

40:52.795 --> 40:55.423
We're going to make it,
Sharon. Okay?

41:06.075 --> 41:07.235
Okay.

41:07.776 --> 41:09.141
Go.

42:29.425 --> 42:30.449
Sharon?

42:32.161 --> 42:34.425
We're still alive.
Why nobody else?

42:35.864 --> 42:36.922
You never get tired.

42:37.032 --> 42:38.056
Trust me.

42:38.967 --> 42:42.027
Helo, come with me. Helo.

42:45.040 --> 42:47.531
Helo.
