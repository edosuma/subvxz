00:24.304 --> 00:26.239
Hi.

00:26.272 --> 00:27.740
Morning.

00:27.773 --> 00:28.941
Good morning!

00:28.974 --> 00:30.310
That was unexpected.

00:33.213 --> 00:34.580
Oy.

01:01.107 --> 01:03.643
"And the bear"

01:03.676 --> 01:05.611
went to the toilet."

01:05.645 --> 01:07.447
Toilet.

01:08.348 --> 01:11.284
'Cause he was a good bear.

01:11.317 --> 01:12.918
What's Mommy reading about?

01:12.952 --> 01:15.288
Mommy's reading about
how certain mean politicians

01:15.321 --> 01:17.723
have been able
to convince workers

01:17.757 --> 01:20.426
that unions are bad for them.

01:20.460 --> 01:23.329
What? Why do they hate
overtime and maternity leave?

01:23.363 --> 01:24.897
They're so silly. And weekends.

01:24.930 --> 01:26.566
Voting against
their self-interest.

01:26.599 --> 01:28.000
Silly voters.

01:28.033 --> 01:29.235
Silly willy voters.

01:33.306 --> 01:35.641
So I tell Ben we need
another restorer

01:35.675 --> 01:37.519
'cause the Guy-Blaché one-reel
is completely vinegar.

01:37.543 --> 01:39.912
Soon, we're gonna lose
the Yasujirô Shimazu...

01:39.945 --> 01:41.089
The one about the courtesan?
Yeah.

01:41.113 --> 01:42.482
I love that one. I mean, sure,

01:42.515 --> 01:44.317
we have the transfer.
It's not the same.

01:44.350 --> 01:46.319
It's not the same at all!
So, what are you saying?

01:46.352 --> 01:49.622
Budget... the restorers in China
charge pennies, you know?

01:49.655 --> 01:51.600
I'm glad they're lifting
themselves out of poverty,

01:51.624 --> 01:53.526
but... Oh, remember that?

01:53.559 --> 01:55.628
Yeah.

01:55.661 --> 01:56.829
I hate them.

01:56.862 --> 01:58.164
Me, too.

02:26.091 --> 02:27.893
What do you think
of this backsplash?

02:27.927 --> 02:29.695
Stop, we didn't make a mistake.

02:29.729 --> 02:30.696
Come on.

02:30.730 --> 02:31.997
We may have made a mistake.

02:32.031 --> 02:32.965
That's dope.

02:32.998 --> 02:34.200
Goddamn it!

02:34.234 --> 02:35.568
Stupid subway tiles.

02:35.601 --> 02:37.169
Find something fun
for date night.

02:37.203 --> 02:38.714
Only if you don't
call it "date night."

02:38.738 --> 02:40.240
Okay, all right, here we go.

02:40.273 --> 02:42.208
Craft beer thing
in, uh, Eagle Rock.

02:42.242 --> 02:44.143
Eh... Lucha VaVOOM?

02:44.176 --> 02:46.879
We could do a cemetery screening.
Wine tasting at Barnsdall.

02:46.912 --> 02:48.690
Quentin's showing one of
my prints at the New Beverly.

02:48.714 --> 02:50.192
Mike can get us
into the Magic Castle.

02:50.216 --> 02:51.860
Papilles prix fixe looks
pretty good this month.

02:51.884 --> 02:53.229
Devendra Banhart
is DJing at the ACE.

02:53.253 --> 02:55.321
We still haven't been
to the new Largo.

02:55.355 --> 02:57.323
Remember our Largo days?

02:57.357 --> 02:59.024
I miss our Largo days.

02:59.058 --> 03:00.393
Me, too.

03:00.426 --> 03:01.503
Still can't believe
you flashed Gnarls Barkley

03:01.527 --> 03:03.363
after that Fiona Apple show.

03:03.396 --> 03:05.831
Thank you.

03:05.865 --> 03:07.199
Don't look now.

03:07.233 --> 03:08.668
That girl's checking you out.

03:08.701 --> 03:09.902
What? Where?

03:09.935 --> 03:11.371
What? No, she's not.

03:11.404 --> 03:12.438
Well, she was.

03:12.472 --> 03:13.873
Maybe she's checking you out.

03:13.906 --> 03:15.908
You go on one date
with Margaret Cho.

03:23.383 --> 03:24.460
What's happening after work?

03:24.484 --> 03:26.018
Band rehearsal.

03:26.051 --> 03:29.188
Hey, what do you think
of the name Not Penny's Boat?

03:29.221 --> 03:30.923
Hate it.

03:30.956 --> 03:32.592
Just tell Colin
to watch his mouth.

03:32.625 --> 03:33.902
He said the "C" word in front
of Harper the other day.

03:33.926 --> 03:35.528
Didn't he, sweet baby?

03:35.561 --> 03:36.696
Get it together, Colin.

03:36.729 --> 03:37.897
And break up with Emily.

03:37.930 --> 03:39.732
She's never gonna
make a good stepmom.

03:39.765 --> 03:40.942
Doing YouTube makeup tutorials

03:40.966 --> 03:42.702
is not a career.

03:42.735 --> 03:43.969
Holy shit!

03:44.003 --> 03:45.204
What? Oh, no.

03:45.237 --> 03:46.806
Oh, God, Rob! What?

03:46.839 --> 03:48.608
Our lives just got so cliché.

03:48.641 --> 03:50.242
What? We got an interview

03:50.276 --> 03:52.545
for the Camelot School
day after tomorrow.

03:52.578 --> 03:54.314
Shit.

03:54.347 --> 03:56.215
Are they gonna know
how much pot we smoke?

03:56.248 --> 03:58.551
They're not gonna drug-test us.

03:58.584 --> 03:59.628
Hey, you could probably pass.

03:59.652 --> 04:00.486
What's that supposed to mean?

04:00.520 --> 04:01.621
Nothing.

04:01.654 --> 04:02.798
You don't smoke much these days.

04:02.822 --> 04:03.999
Do you want me to fall asleep?

04:04.023 --> 04:05.124
It's not a criticism.

04:05.157 --> 04:06.559
You know, more for me.

04:06.592 --> 04:08.728
Are we really gonna become this?

04:08.761 --> 04:10.330
Hey, our job

04:10.363 --> 04:14.467
is to present to the world
a human woman of quality.

04:14.500 --> 04:15.835
Harper's awesome.

04:15.868 --> 04:17.403
She deserves to go
to a great school.

04:17.437 --> 04:19.305
If you feel really guilty,

04:19.339 --> 04:21.140
you could cut down on
massages for Sandwiches.

04:21.173 --> 04:22.742
It was one time!

04:22.775 --> 04:24.009
He wasn't pooping!

04:26.312 --> 04:27.513
Bye, baby! Bye, baby.

04:27.547 --> 04:29.682
See you later.

05:02.582 --> 05:03.649
One more?

05:04.917 --> 05:06.886
It's late.
But this season is so good.

05:06.919 --> 05:08.621
We could mess around.

05:08.654 --> 05:10.222
I'd rather watch
another episode.

05:10.255 --> 05:11.557
Oh, God, I'll kill you.

05:11.591 --> 05:12.801
Stop!

05:12.825 --> 05:13.826
Sandwiches!

05:15.027 --> 05:16.061
The baby.

05:16.095 --> 05:17.630
Dumb dog.

05:17.663 --> 05:18.631
Dog dummy.

05:18.664 --> 05:19.799
Give him a break.

05:19.832 --> 05:21.333
It's tough being bred so shitty.

05:21.367 --> 05:23.302
Oh, he's probably
barking at a can collector.

05:23.335 --> 05:24.470
So embarrassing.

05:24.504 --> 05:26.305
Like they need that?

05:26.338 --> 05:27.807
All right, one more.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.809
Previously on Exemplified...

05:43.088 --> 05:45.224
pornography,
epic skateboard fails,

05:45.257 --> 05:48.761
my music,
marathons of Treehouse Masters.

05:48.794 --> 05:50.763
I mean, the old lions
had it easy.

05:50.796 --> 05:52.231
The only distraction
from writing

05:52.264 --> 05:54.333
was the encroaching
tide of fascism.

05:54.366 --> 05:57.036
And the occasional
syphilitic seizure.

05:57.069 --> 05:58.538
Are you listening?

05:58.571 --> 05:59.905
Of course.

05:59.939 --> 06:02.341
As such, if I am
to have any hope

06:02.374 --> 06:05.244
of finishing the sample chapters
for my serious erotic novel,

06:05.277 --> 06:06.712
I need your help.

06:06.746 --> 06:09.915
I have here three envelopes
stamped and addressed,

06:09.949 --> 06:12.217
each containing
something horrible

06:12.251 --> 06:15.287
I do not want mailed
under any circumstances.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.890
On the back are
dates and page counts.

06:17.923 --> 06:21.360
I miss a deadline,
you mail the envelope.

06:21.393 --> 06:23.929
In ascending order
of horribleness,

06:23.963 --> 06:26.466
a check to BAMLA, a love letter

06:26.499 --> 06:29.101
to Becca, and the worst,

06:29.134 --> 06:31.571
an invitation for my family
to come visit,

06:31.604 --> 06:33.138
all expenses paid.

06:33.172 --> 06:35.274
I mean, the horror of
any of these being mailed

06:35.307 --> 06:37.209
is so severe that it will serve

06:37.242 --> 06:39.278
as all the motivation
I need to write.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.981
Okay.

06:42.014 --> 06:43.048
Ah, damn it!

06:43.082 --> 06:44.249
I'm late for work.

06:44.283 --> 06:45.785
The bar opened 20 minutes ago.

06:45.818 --> 06:46.752
I'll drop you off.

06:46.786 --> 06:48.320
I think I'll walk.

06:48.353 --> 06:52.091
Um... you forgot something.

07:00.966 --> 07:02.735
What's happening after work?

07:02.768 --> 07:03.903
Band rehearsal.

07:11.644 --> 07:13.579
Didn't he, sweet baby?

07:13.613 --> 07:14.780
Get it together, Colin.

07:14.814 --> 07:15.981
And break up with Emily.

07:16.015 --> 07:17.158
She's never gonna make
a good stepmom.

07:17.182 --> 07:19.118
Doing YouTube makeup tutorials

07:19.151 --> 07:20.853
is not a career.

07:20.886 --> 07:22.087
Oh, God.

07:22.121 --> 07:24.123
Oh, Rob,
our lives just got so cliché.

07:24.156 --> 07:26.325
What? We got an interview
for the Camelot School

07:26.358 --> 07:28.260
day after tomorrow.

07:28.293 --> 07:30.362
Shit. Are we really
gonna become this?

07:30.395 --> 07:32.297
Hey, Harper's awesome.

07:32.331 --> 07:33.609
She deserves to go
to a great school.

07:33.633 --> 07:34.967
If you feel really guilty,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.036
you can cut down
on massages for Sandwiches.

07:37.069 --> 07:38.270
He wasn't pooping.

07:38.303 --> 07:41.006
Oh.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.942
Bye, baby!

07:42.975 --> 07:45.177
Bye, baby. See you later.

07:59.424 --> 08:02.161
Hey, Gretchen.

08:02.194 --> 08:03.805
Do you ever wonder how
your life would be different

08:03.829 --> 08:05.674
if you'd never walked into
that recruiter's office?

08:05.698 --> 08:07.232
It's funny you ask that.

08:07.266 --> 08:09.068
That summer while
I was at basic,

08:09.101 --> 08:11.971
there was a drive-by that took
the life of a young baby...

08:12.004 --> 08:13.582
They talk about how if you
make one different decision,

08:13.606 --> 08:15.507
your life might be
totally different,

08:15.541 --> 08:17.076
but is that your only shot?!

08:17.109 --> 08:19.044
Can you make another decision?

08:19.078 --> 08:21.714
Or-or a series of decisions
that could get you back

08:21.747 --> 08:23.258
to the alternative life
that you never got to lead?

08:23.282 --> 08:26.018
Okay, maybe I was
not clear earlier.

08:26.051 --> 08:27.486
I'm writing!

08:27.519 --> 08:30.155
It looks like you're drinking
and playing darts.

08:30.189 --> 08:31.824
Okay.

08:31.857 --> 08:33.659
Edgar, this is for you, too.

08:33.693 --> 08:37.929
In fact, everyone... writing is
very seldom actual writing.

08:37.962 --> 08:40.933
Like, maybe on the outside,
it looks as though I'm drinking

08:40.966 --> 08:43.268
and playing darts
and eating Craisins

08:43.302 --> 08:47.039
out of the box in my pocket,
but this is part of the process.

08:47.072 --> 08:48.741
It's all writing.

08:48.774 --> 08:53.045
And I need you
to respect my process.

08:53.078 --> 08:54.847
All right.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.149
I'll let you get on
with the writing, then.

08:58.117 --> 09:00.119
Oh, come...

09:00.152 --> 09:02.254
Want me to go, too?

09:02.287 --> 09:05.057
Can't. You're part
of the process now.

09:12.264 --> 09:13.265
Sandwiches!

09:29.081 --> 09:30.983
Hey, buddy.

09:32.151 --> 09:35.254
How's it going?

09:35.287 --> 09:37.389
Here you go.

09:37.422 --> 09:40.960
Yeah, that's the stuff.

09:40.993 --> 09:43.629
You're a good boy.

09:43.663 --> 09:47.767
See, dogs do eat nachos.

10:18.230 --> 10:20.599
Okay, honey, here we go.

10:20.632 --> 10:22.768
Num-num.
Mommy's got to go convince

10:22.802 --> 10:24.804
a bad developer man
to put roof gardens

10:24.837 --> 10:26.271
on his hideous condos.

10:28.007 --> 10:29.685
- Have fun at the park.
- We need

10:29.709 --> 10:31.677
a restock on quinoa, aisle two.
Ready to go...?

10:31.711 --> 10:33.879
Eh, excuse me.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.516
Hi, sorry. Can I help?

10:37.549 --> 10:39.384
Yes, please.

10:39.418 --> 10:41.053
Could you hold her for a second?

10:41.086 --> 10:42.722
Oh, thank you.

10:42.755 --> 10:45.557
I'm so sorry.

10:45.590 --> 10:47.760
Hey.

10:51.430 --> 10:53.232
Want to go over there?

10:53.265 --> 10:55.334
Yes.

10:58.403 --> 10:59.371
What's this?

11:07.947 --> 11:09.982
Do you like kombucha?

11:11.616 --> 11:13.218
Me neither.

11:13.252 --> 11:14.519
Ooh.

11:14.553 --> 11:16.388
Oops!

11:29.101 --> 11:32.772
Harper? Harper?

11:32.805 --> 11:35.574
Harper?

11:38.610 --> 11:39.745
Harper?

11:40.612 --> 11:42.882
Harper?!

11:42.915 --> 11:44.049
Oh, my God.

11:44.083 --> 11:45.050
Hi.

11:46.718 --> 11:48.387
She wanted to look
around.

12:07.106 --> 12:09.208
Uh-oh, nostalgia box.

12:09.241 --> 12:11.811
Goddamn, this used to be
so much fun.

12:11.844 --> 12:13.779
Now? Still fun as shit.

12:13.813 --> 12:15.981
All right, gimme.

12:16.015 --> 12:18.183
Gimme, gimme.

12:29.761 --> 12:31.396
All right, sigh-face,
what's wrong?

12:31.430 --> 12:33.465
Nitrate decomposition.

12:33.498 --> 12:36.001
You didn't get the grant?

12:36.035 --> 12:39.604
I told them we've lost
over 75% of all silent film.

12:39.638 --> 12:44.009
A major art form
created and destroyed

12:44.043 --> 12:45.444
in the span of a century.

12:45.477 --> 12:46.778
They didn't care.

12:46.812 --> 12:48.647
Maybe I don't either anymore.

12:49.949 --> 12:51.750
I'm gonna have a gallon
of wine; Want some?

12:51.783 --> 12:53.494
We said we wouldn't; We have
the interview tomorrow morning.

12:53.518 --> 12:54.820
Oh, goddamn it!

12:54.854 --> 12:55.988
How's Harpoon?

12:56.021 --> 12:57.522
Asleep.

12:57.556 --> 12:59.596
Nanny said she spilled juice
all over herself today.

12:59.624 --> 13:01.460
Likely story, Lupé.

13:01.493 --> 13:03.338
Well, what am I supposed
to do now? You took my game.

13:03.362 --> 13:05.330
Tough titties.

13:05.364 --> 13:06.798
Sorry about your grant.

13:06.832 --> 13:09.134
Yeah, well...

13:09.168 --> 13:10.335
I'm gonna feed Sandwiches.

13:10.369 --> 13:12.437
Okay. Try not to depress him.

13:12.471 --> 13:14.806
Sandwiches!

13:16.675 --> 13:20.212
Here, boy.

13:20.245 --> 13:22.915
Sandwiches? Sandwiches?

13:25.851 --> 13:27.486
He's gone.

13:57.016 --> 13:59.060
Get the ball... get it, get it,
get it, get it. Get the ball.

13:59.084 --> 14:01.020
Yay!

14:15.100 --> 14:17.369
Aw, is she friendly?

14:17.402 --> 14:18.837
Oh, yes, he.

14:18.870 --> 14:20.539
Oh. His name's Sandwiches.

14:20.572 --> 14:23.042
Aw, cute. He has to take a
pill, but he's a good dog.

14:23.075 --> 14:25.410
Aw. Who rescued who, right?

14:25.444 --> 14:27.712
I ask myself that all the time.

14:27.746 --> 14:29.248
So does my husband.

14:29.281 --> 14:32.251
He has band practice right now,
so I cleared out.

14:32.284 --> 14:34.954
The thing is, our daughter has
a school interview tomorrow,

14:34.987 --> 14:38.723
so that's a stress,
but it's a good stress.

14:38.757 --> 14:41.393
Come on, Lucy.

14:41.426 --> 14:43.963
Bye.

14:43.996 --> 14:46.398
I miss our Largo days,
Sandwiches.

14:46.431 --> 14:47.933
Don't you?

14:47.967 --> 14:49.401
Our Largo days.

14:55.507 --> 14:58.243
We will, thank you.

14:58.277 --> 15:00.245
What'd the shelters say?

15:00.279 --> 15:03.582
It's too early for him to be in
the system if anybody found him.

15:03.615 --> 15:05.260
I told you we shouldn't
leave him outside alone.

15:05.284 --> 15:08.220
He has always gotten to hang
outside when he wants to.

15:08.253 --> 15:09.630
That's 'cause
you taught him early on

15:09.654 --> 15:10.622
that's where he belongs.

15:10.655 --> 15:11.991
Dogs want jobs.

15:12.024 --> 15:14.626
Sandwiches does not want a job!

15:14.659 --> 15:16.828
He-he likes to look at stuff.

15:16.861 --> 15:18.897
And now he's looking
at the inside of a coyote.

15:18.930 --> 15:21.833
Oh, my God,
why would you say that?

15:21.866 --> 15:26.171
Jesus, don't say that to me
about my dog.

15:26.205 --> 15:27.572
And there we go.

15:27.606 --> 15:29.341
You know what I mean...
I've had him longer.

15:29.374 --> 15:32.277
And to accuse me of somehow
not caring for him properly

15:32.311 --> 15:33.845
is stunningly hurtful.

15:33.878 --> 15:37.816
Can we please just postpone
this stupid interview?

15:37.849 --> 15:39.818
No. Why would we do that?

15:39.851 --> 15:42.988
Because a family member
is missing, Lexi!

15:47.626 --> 15:49.294
Hi.

15:49.328 --> 15:50.295
Oh, my God! Oh, Sandwiches!

15:50.329 --> 15:51.496
Ha! You're back.

15:51.530 --> 15:52.797
Hey! Oh, my God.

15:52.831 --> 15:54.366
Oh, no. Oh, thank you so much.

15:54.399 --> 15:55.700
Hey. Hey, dummy.

15:55.734 --> 15:57.178
Did you open the gate?
Thank you so much.

15:57.202 --> 15:59.004
Hey, cutie, do you not
like living here?

15:59.038 --> 16:00.339
I-I live in the neighborhood.

16:00.372 --> 16:02.274
I pass this guy all the time.

16:02.307 --> 16:03.675
He ran right up to me.

16:03.708 --> 16:04.776
We're friends.

16:04.809 --> 16:06.111
Let us give you a reward.

16:06.145 --> 16:07.712
Oh, God, no,
I'm just glad he's home.

16:07.746 --> 16:09.881
Well, uh, gosh,
thank you so much.

16:11.216 --> 16:12.484
Hey, I'm sorry.

16:12.517 --> 16:13.718
That's a really great chair.

16:13.752 --> 16:15.154
I'm thinking
of redoing my study.

16:15.187 --> 16:16.555
Do you know who makes it?

16:16.588 --> 16:18.857
Oh, uh, I have it
written down somewhere.

16:18.890 --> 16:19.858
Please, come in.

16:19.891 --> 16:21.460
Oh, thanks.

16:21.493 --> 16:23.628
Uh...

16:23.662 --> 16:24.563
Oh, Gretchen.

16:24.596 --> 16:26.298
Lexi. This is Rob.

16:26.331 --> 16:27.908
We have to keep
our voices down a little,

16:27.932 --> 16:28.867
'cause our daughter is sleeping.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.369
Oh. Cute.

16:30.402 --> 16:32.037
C-Can I get you a glass of wine?

16:32.071 --> 16:33.038
Oh, God, uh...

16:33.072 --> 16:34.739
Sure, why not?

16:36.341 --> 16:37.409
Amazing ramen.

16:37.442 --> 16:39.411
Amazing coffee.

16:39.444 --> 16:40.545
Both walking distance.

16:40.579 --> 16:42.181
Bars...

16:42.214 --> 16:44.483
Harper can take music lessons
at a place owned by Flea.

16:44.516 --> 16:47.018
I mean, I get
it, Gretchen, I do.

16:47.052 --> 16:49.054
But we don't know anything.

16:49.088 --> 16:50.755
We're just a couple of idiots

16:50.789 --> 16:53.068
who boned in the bathroom of
the Echo the first night we met.

16:53.092 --> 16:55.427
Oh... Trying to figure it out.

16:55.460 --> 16:57.096
Totally aware of the pitfalls

16:57.129 --> 16:59.198
and the hazards and
the compromises...

16:59.231 --> 17:00.865
In the bathroom
at a secret Primus show.

17:00.899 --> 17:02.167
And yet still doing it.

17:02.201 --> 17:04.236
Vince Vaughn was there.

17:04.269 --> 17:05.569
Not in the bathroom.

17:05.604 --> 17:06.914
Conventional
and scary? Hell yeah.

17:06.938 --> 17:08.906
But the death of fun?

17:08.940 --> 17:10.108
Not necessarily.

17:10.142 --> 17:12.844
To be a slave to
an idea of coolness

17:12.877 --> 17:14.546
is why some of your
friends never grow

17:14.579 --> 17:16.848
and in the end are
actually less themselves

17:16.881 --> 17:19.917
and counterintuitively
live less authentic lives

17:19.951 --> 17:21.752
than the buyers-in.

17:26.891 --> 17:28.860
Hey, baby.

17:28.893 --> 17:30.762
Oh, hello.

17:30.795 --> 17:32.097
Come in. I'm Rob.

17:32.131 --> 17:33.064
That's Lexi.

17:33.098 --> 17:34.099
Oh.

17:34.133 --> 17:35.934
Jimmy Shive-Overly. Hi.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.969
I found their dog. I heard.

17:38.002 --> 17:39.804
You're quite
the Carolus Linnaeus.

17:40.772 --> 17:42.073
He invented the modern system

17:42.107 --> 17:44.476
for binomial nomenclature
for animals.

17:45.310 --> 17:47.246
It's an imperfect analogy.

17:47.279 --> 17:48.713
Thanks for coming
to walk me home.

17:48.747 --> 17:50.615
Oh, no problem. Ah, vino.

17:50.649 --> 17:52.251
Thank you.

17:52.284 --> 17:53.661
So we don't really know
anyone in the neighborhood.

17:53.685 --> 17:55.887
What do you folks do?

17:55.920 --> 17:58.957
Uh, Lexi's a
green space architect.

17:58.990 --> 18:00.659
- And I'm a film restorer.
- Ah.

18:00.692 --> 18:02.161
You are doing God's work, sir.

18:02.194 --> 18:04.996
But if everything's digitized,
who needs film?

18:05.029 --> 18:07.399
Actually, film is far more
stable than digital storage.

18:07.432 --> 18:09.568
Can't see how that's possible.
It's true.

18:09.601 --> 18:11.603
Okay, well, agree to disagree.

18:11.636 --> 18:14.139
Jimmy's a writer. For what show?

18:15.474 --> 18:16.841
Not for television.

18:16.875 --> 18:17.942
Gah, can you imagine?

18:17.976 --> 18:20.679
No, I'm a... I'm a novelist.

18:20.712 --> 18:22.147
Why live out here?

18:22.181 --> 18:24.149
Yeah, right?

18:24.183 --> 18:25.517
Right.

18:25.550 --> 18:27.419
Anyway, I've recently devised

18:27.452 --> 18:30.422
a flawless punishment-based
productivity solution,

18:30.455 --> 18:32.157
if either of you are having
any trouble.

18:32.191 --> 18:33.458
Who knows when they might air

18:33.492 --> 18:35.427
another marathon
of Treehouse Masters?

18:35.460 --> 18:37.128
Rob built a tree house
for our daughter.

18:37.162 --> 18:39.698
What?! She's a little
too young for it, but...

18:39.731 --> 18:41.433
Uh, may I see it?!

18:41.466 --> 18:43.134
Sure, sure.

18:43.168 --> 18:45.146
It's a dual-tree platform
structure, no electric yet.

18:45.170 --> 18:48.006
Uh, may I see it immediately?!

18:48.039 --> 18:49.308
Follow me.

18:52.977 --> 18:54.646
All right.

18:54.679 --> 18:56.315
Yeah.

18:59.851 --> 19:01.786
Hey, thanks for everything.

19:01.820 --> 19:04.456
I don't want to bore
you with the details,

19:04.489 --> 19:06.000
but, seriously, this was exactly
what I needed.

19:06.024 --> 19:08.527
You like LCD Soundsystem?
Not really.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.161
I know what you mean.

19:10.195 --> 19:13.398
Anyway, I just want you to know,
you guys are great.

19:13.432 --> 19:14.866
Hmm? Are we?

19:14.899 --> 19:16.535
Yeah, you are.

19:16.568 --> 19:17.636
Trust me.

19:18.937 --> 19:20.572
I don't know.

19:20.605 --> 19:23.007
Sometimes I just
look around and wonder,

19:23.041 --> 19:25.176
like, how did this happen?

19:25.210 --> 19:27.246
I mean, Lexi just got this Mini.

19:27.279 --> 19:29.214
It's a really good car.

19:29.248 --> 19:30.882
Gas mileage is great.

19:30.915 --> 19:33.218
But I see it in the driveway,

19:33.252 --> 19:36.255
and it's like, "Ugh, what?!"

19:37.922 --> 19:39.900
I mean, one minute I'm living
in this cute little studio

19:39.924 --> 19:42.594
near Beachwood,
interning at New Line,

19:42.627 --> 19:43.895
swing dancing at the Derby.

19:43.928 --> 19:47.766
Just me and my dog
and pizza and condoms.

19:47.799 --> 19:49.701
Remember those?

19:49.734 --> 19:52.704
Suddenly I have a child and a
mortgage, and it's like, "What?"

19:52.737 --> 19:54.706
Hey, if you ever want
to go to Cha Cha's

19:54.739 --> 19:57.776
and get a drink,
I would be totally down.

19:57.809 --> 19:59.177
I don't even know anymore.

19:59.210 --> 20:02.414
Lexi's always like,
"School, Harper's school."

20:02.447 --> 20:05.083
And it's, like, fine,
but on the other hand,

20:05.116 --> 20:07.386
I don't want to be having
that conversation, you know?

20:07.419 --> 20:09.554
Like, I love the kid, obviously.

20:09.588 --> 20:11.923
I'm not gonna say she stole
my life, but come on.

20:11.956 --> 20:15.594
I mean, what, if we get
a divorce, I'd only be 44.

20:15.627 --> 20:18.263
Just check into
one of those motels,

20:18.297 --> 20:20.699
get a bottle of Jack,
like, invite whoever.

20:20.732 --> 20:22.701
Your boyfriend seems
really cool.

20:22.734 --> 20:24.736
Seriously, Lexi goes
to bed crazy early,

20:24.769 --> 20:26.705
so if you guys are
ever going out,

20:26.738 --> 20:28.607
just shoot me a text;
She doesn't care.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.610
That's what I thought!

20:31.643 --> 20:33.412
Very nice work
on the tree house, Rob.

20:33.445 --> 20:37.616
Thank you. I downloaded
the instructions from the Web.

20:37.649 --> 20:39.584
Single malt?

20:39.618 --> 20:41.662
Ah, twist my arm. Rob, we have the
Camelot interview in the morning.

20:41.686 --> 20:43.288
Too late.

20:43.322 --> 20:44.823
And I guess we're
drinking Scotch now.

20:44.856 --> 20:46.257
Actually, we should go.

20:46.291 --> 20:47.659
What? No! Oh, okay.

20:48.793 --> 20:49.828
Thank you again.

20:49.861 --> 20:50.962
Seriously.

20:50.995 --> 20:52.331
Yeah, no problem.

20:52.364 --> 20:53.832
All right, bye.

20:55.133 --> 20:56.968
Hey, seriously, we should
get dinner sometime.

20:57.001 --> 20:58.136
The four of us.

20:58.169 --> 20:59.471
I'll find you online.

20:59.504 --> 21:00.739
That's got...

21:00.772 --> 21:02.173
Uh, that's a, um, childproof...

21:02.206 --> 21:04.175
Okay, good, you got it.

21:15.954 --> 21:17.989
Well, I would just
like to thank you

21:18.022 --> 21:20.024
from the bottom of my heart
for inviting me.

21:20.058 --> 21:21.993
They were hilarious.

21:22.026 --> 21:24.996
Did you notice their
matching anchor tattoos?

21:25.029 --> 21:26.998
And he must have spent months

21:27.031 --> 21:30.669
on literally the most boring
tree house in the world.

21:30.702 --> 21:33.372
Oh, and I made my deadline.

21:33.405 --> 21:34.673
As of today.

21:34.706 --> 21:38.009
You may tear up
the envelopes, thank God.

21:38.042 --> 21:40.044
Yeah, this was
a lovely present for that.

21:40.078 --> 21:42.013
So thank you.

21:42.046 --> 21:45.016
And they named
their dog Sandwiches.

21:45.049 --> 21:48.019
I mean, at some point, you have
to look at your lives and say...

22:13.912 --> 22:16.548
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

22:36.267 --> 22:39.971
You know, if you lowered me
about three feet...

22:48.747 --> 22:52.050
You
know, I grew up in a town,

22:52.083 --> 22:54.385
a town where a little boy
could have big dreams.

22:54.419 --> 22:56.254
Not a town
where the Jets go for two...

22:56.287 --> 22:59.057
when my kicker needs
one freakin' point,

22:59.090 --> 23:03.361
so, for once in my life, I'm not
left festering in misery, please!

23:03.394 --> 23:06.197
The League.
All new, Wednesdays at 10:00.

23:06.230 --> 23:08.332
Only on FXX.

23:15.940 --> 23:19.944
Fargo. All-new,
Mondays at 10:00 on FX.

23:21.079 --> 23:23.047
- This January...
- Yow!

23:23.081 --> 23:25.149
- Yikes.
- Ha-ha!

23:25.183 --> 23:26.818
- Hoo!
- Ow!

23:26.851 --> 23:29.320
R-R-R-Remix! Oh!

23:29.353 --> 23:31.355
- The all new season.
- Yaah!

23:31.389 --> 23:32.223
Aaah!

23:32.256 --> 23:34.358
Sunny returns January.

23:34.392 --> 23:35.827
Only on FXX.

23:37.428 --> 23:38.530
Who are you guys?

23:38.563 --> 23:40.803
- We have come to have sex with you.
- Holy...

23:42.634 --> 23:44.803
