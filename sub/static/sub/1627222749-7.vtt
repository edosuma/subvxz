00:06.528 --> 00:08.791
- Good morning, Cousin Tommy.
I love you.

00:08.834 --> 00:11.185
- Good morning, Cousin Mel.
I love you.

00:13.187 --> 00:16.146
Good morning, Cousin Sam.
I love you.

00:16.190 --> 00:20.063
- Good morning, Cousin Tommy.
I love you.

00:20.107 --> 00:22.674
Good morning, Cousin Becca.
I love you.

00:22.718 --> 00:27.505
- Good morning, Cousin Sam.
I love you.

00:27.549 --> 00:30.334
Good morning, Pappy Boyle.
I love you.

00:30.378 --> 00:34.034
- Good morning, Becca.
I love you.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.558
- Ooh, extra-long hug.

00:36.601 --> 00:40.127
What got into you
this morning, Pappy?

00:41.476 --> 00:42.564
Pappy?

00:44.870 --> 00:46.133
Pappy!

00:52.835 --> 00:59.755
<i>♪</i>

01:09.852 --> 01:11.071
- Oh, Charles.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.898
I'm so sorry
about your great-uncle Pappy.

01:12.942 --> 01:13.943
You holding up okay?

01:13.986 --> 01:14.987
- I've been managing.

01:15.031 --> 01:16.119
- Mm...
Have you though?

01:16.163 --> 01:17.642
- Number two, step up.
Say, "Charles,

01:17.686 --> 01:19.383
it's Pappy.
I'll always love you."

01:19.427 --> 01:21.211
- Okay.
Uh, "Charles, it's Pappy.

01:21.255 --> 01:22.473
I'll always love you."

01:22.517 --> 01:24.301
- Then why did
you leave me?

01:24.345 --> 01:26.173
Anyway, thanks for coming
with me to the funeral.

01:26.216 --> 01:27.391
I think we're all packed.

01:27.435 --> 01:28.610
I just got
to go grab the coffin.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.046
- Wait, why are you
bringing the coffin?

01:30.090 --> 01:32.222
- I brought a coffin
to my nana's funeral on a whim,

01:32.266 --> 01:33.397
and it was a big hit.

01:33.441 --> 01:36.226
So now, guess who's
the coffin cousin?

01:36.270 --> 01:37.575
- Got to say, Terry,

01:37.619 --> 01:38.794
I'm a little surprised you're
coming to this.

01:38.837 --> 01:40.361
- Honestly, I need a break
from the kids.

01:40.404 --> 01:42.319
Cagney and Lacey keep trying
to trick me into falling

01:42.363 --> 01:43.799
down the stairs on TikTok.

01:43.842 --> 01:45.583
Terry can't
sprain another ankle.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.150
- Well, I, for one, am pumped
to be going.

01:47.194 --> 01:48.760
- To a funeral?
- I'm so bored, Terry.

01:48.804 --> 01:50.501
I've been suspended
for 87 days.

01:50.545 --> 01:51.894
Mac gets dropped off
at day care,

01:51.937 --> 01:53.852
and I just sit at home
playing "Animal Crossing."

01:53.896 --> 01:55.767
But no one will buy
my bugs or fossils.

01:55.811 --> 01:57.856
I'm desperate for some
normal human interaction.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.163
- Coffin delivery!

02:00.207 --> 02:01.382
- Okay, fine.
It doesn't have to be

02:01.425 --> 02:03.601
normal or human.
Any interaction will work.

02:03.645 --> 02:05.255
- Yo.
You forgot your lunch.

02:05.299 --> 02:06.865
- Oh.
Thank you, Diaz.

02:06.909 --> 02:08.606
- Sir, I didn't realize you
were still staying at Rosa's.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.086
I thought couple's counseling
was going well.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.348
- Not anymore.

02:11.392 --> 02:12.393
At Kevin's request,
I offered to reduce

02:12.436 --> 02:14.134
my work hours by 26%.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.396
Kevin countered with 50.

02:15.439 --> 02:16.701
Which I countered with 30.

02:16.745 --> 02:17.876
Then Kevin says 40--

02:17.920 --> 02:19.443
- Seems like a lot
of math for therapy.

02:19.487 --> 02:21.271
- That's what
Dr. Cheryl said...

02:21.315 --> 02:23.273
which is why we fired her,

02:23.317 --> 02:24.927
and now we're working
with Dr. Ramanujan.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.843
He's a physicist with a nice,
concrete worldview.

02:27.886 --> 02:30.367
Anyway, Kevin refuses
to budge from 36%.

02:30.411 --> 02:32.978
And I'm starting to worry
that I might lose to him.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.154
- You mean lose him.

02:34.197 --> 02:35.372
- No.
Lose to him.

02:35.416 --> 02:37.592
Therapy is a chess match.

02:37.635 --> 02:38.723
And...

02:38.767 --> 02:39.855
I will prevail.

02:39.898 --> 02:42.510
- Or it's about saving
your marriage.

02:42.553 --> 02:44.642
You should make
a grand romantic gesture.

02:44.686 --> 02:46.470
- Ugh, so dumb.
- Seriously?

02:46.514 --> 02:48.124
From the woman who
loves Nancy Meyers movies?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.299
- Yeah.

02:49.343 --> 02:50.779
Here's what
I've learned as a PI.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.520
People suck, everyone cheats,
and love is an illusion.

02:52.563 --> 02:54.435
Nancy Meyers is a fool,
and Holt should start dating.

02:54.478 --> 02:55.610
What?
- You heard me.

02:55.653 --> 02:57.394
It's the only way
you're gonna beat Kevin.

02:57.438 --> 02:59.831
- I'm thinking about it.
I'm considering it,

02:59.875 --> 03:02.486
and I've decided.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.009
I'm in.
-

03:04.053 --> 03:05.097
<i>- Here it is.</i>

03:05.141 --> 03:06.708
Pappy Boyle's farm.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.710
I spent every summer
here as a kid.

03:08.753 --> 03:10.538
- Got to say, it's
nicer than I was expecting.

03:10.581 --> 03:11.756
- Pappy did well
for himself.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.323
He went to
business school in New York.

03:13.367 --> 03:14.716
He got a job
in Wall Street.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.544
And one day his hand
got caught in a subway door.

03:16.587 --> 03:18.807
And he was dragged
from Times Square into Queens.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.156
Largest settlement
in city history.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.505
- Ew.

03:21.549 --> 03:23.594
Pappy should've used
that cash on pest control.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.248
There's giant rats everywhere.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.902
- Those are nutria, Terry.

03:26.945 --> 03:27.903
They're nothing like rats.

03:27.946 --> 03:28.904
They have meatier haunches,

03:28.947 --> 03:30.210
and their teeth
are more orange.

03:30.253 --> 03:32.342
You know, nutria
are actually great pets.

03:32.386 --> 03:33.604
They're affectionate
and smart.

03:33.648 --> 03:34.866
They know how
to open doors.

03:34.910 --> 03:35.780
Plus, you can milk them.

03:35.824 --> 03:36.825
- But...

03:36.868 --> 03:37.652
should you?

03:37.695 --> 03:38.740
- Pappy drank nutria milk,

03:38.783 --> 03:39.828
and he was fit
as a fiddle.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.264
Anyway, you got
to see the house.

03:41.308 --> 03:44.180
I can't wait to show you
the rug I was born on.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.573
- Sure it's been
cleaned since then.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.618
- Charles Boyle,
I love you.

03:47.662 --> 03:50.230
- Sam Boyle,
I love you.

03:56.279 --> 03:57.498
Where's that dead body?

03:57.541 --> 03:59.891
- He's in the barn,
and he looks adorable.

03:59.935 --> 04:00.979
- Ah, terrific.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.024
And everything's set
for the funeral?

04:02.067 --> 04:03.155
- There's one little issue.

04:03.199 --> 04:04.722
We can't find Pappy's will.

04:04.766 --> 04:06.115
- What?
- He wanted to leave the farm

04:06.158 --> 04:07.247
to the Council of Cousins,

04:07.290 --> 04:08.291
but if we don't
find those papers,

04:08.335 --> 04:09.640
it goes to Cousin Lyndon.

04:09.684 --> 04:10.772
- Oh, no.

04:10.815 --> 04:12.382
- Who's Cousin Lyndon?
- Pappy's son.

04:12.426 --> 04:13.601
He's the black sheep
of the family.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.559
- Wait, so we have
a wealthy patriarch

04:15.603 --> 04:17.648
who mysteriously died,
a missing will,

04:17.692 --> 04:19.998
and a black sheep set
to inherit everything?

04:20.042 --> 04:21.696
Am I the only one
who suspects foul play here?

04:21.739 --> 04:24.394
- He didn't die mysteriously.
He was 93.

04:24.438 --> 04:25.569
- He was fit as fiddle, Terr.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.049
From all the nutria milk.

04:27.092 --> 04:28.137
- Don't be ridiculous.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.443
No Boyle would
ever commit murder.

04:29.486 --> 04:31.096
Boyles don't even
get mad at each other.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.969
Except in that rare instance
of cousin-on-cousin jealousy.

04:34.012 --> 04:35.579
- You're just bored
from your suspension

04:35.623 --> 04:37.015
and desperate
to find a case to work.

04:37.059 --> 04:38.408
- No.
That's not it.

04:38.452 --> 04:39.583
I'm just telling you,

04:39.627 --> 04:41.455
something doesn't
smell right here.

04:41.498 --> 04:42.934
- Oh, yeah.
That's Pappy's body.

04:42.978 --> 04:44.632
Cousin Mel did
the embalming in here,

04:44.675 --> 04:46.982
and I think she forgot
to add something.

04:47.025 --> 04:48.113
- Well...

04:48.157 --> 04:50.028
that's a disturbing revelation.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.336
- Hey.
What's going on?

04:53.380 --> 04:54.598
- I'm helping Holt
pick a dating site.

04:54.642 --> 04:55.904
- Oh, this looks good.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.166
- PhDs only.

04:57.209 --> 04:58.472
- Uh, actually
in this context,

04:58.515 --> 05:00.735
PHD stands for
Pretty Huge

05:00.778 --> 05:02.345
- Oh, my.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.782
I can only assume that MDs only
stands for Medium

05:04.826 --> 05:06.175
- Rosa, can I talk
to you for a second?

05:06.218 --> 05:07.611
What the hell are you doing?

05:07.655 --> 05:09.787
Why are you trying to get Holt
and Kevin to break up?

05:09.831 --> 05:11.528
- I'm trying to get Holt
and Kevin back together.

05:11.572 --> 05:13.313
He and Kevin are perfect
for each other.

05:13.356 --> 05:14.575
He just needs
to realize that.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.098
Once he sees what other
trash is out there,

05:16.141 --> 05:18.318
he's gonna go running straight
back into Kevin's arms,

05:18.361 --> 05:19.971
just like
in a Nancy Meyers movie.

05:20.015 --> 05:21.408
- So you still love
Nancy Meyers?

05:21.451 --> 05:23.148
- I will never turn my back
on Nancy Meyers.

05:23.192 --> 05:24.541
- Okay.
I'm in.

05:24.585 --> 05:27.370
Let operation
"Lucky Number Kevin" begin.

05:27.414 --> 05:28.371
- I'm out.
- No, no, no.

05:28.415 --> 05:29.720
We don't have
to call it that.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.722
- Okay, then I'll think
I'll finish up by saying

05:31.766 --> 05:33.985
Pappy Boyle
was the best hugger.

05:34.029 --> 05:36.336
Which is surprising because
he lost his hand in the subway.

05:36.379 --> 05:40.209
But he always said,
"You don't hug with your hands,

05:40.252 --> 05:42.080
"you hug with your heart.

05:42.124 --> 05:44.431
And your groin."
He got that groin involved.

05:44.474 --> 05:46.911
- Uh, a lot of groin talk
for a eulogy.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.260
- Everyone,

05:48.304 --> 05:50.175
there's something you need
to see in the barn.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.438
The game...

05:51.481 --> 05:52.656
is afoot.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.658
<i>- Pappy Boyle was 93.</i>

05:54.702 --> 05:56.268
Who would've suspected
that his death stemmed

05:56.312 --> 05:58.793
from anything other than the
cruel embrace of Father Time?

05:58.836 --> 06:00.969
To suggest as much
might get someone labeled

06:01.012 --> 06:02.274
a crackpot, a kook,

06:02.318 --> 06:04.451
someone that's
"bored with their suspension."

06:04.494 --> 06:06.235
- Can you cut the
"Harriet The Spy" windup?

06:06.278 --> 06:07.715
It stinks in here.

06:07.758 --> 06:10.326
- What you're smelling, Terry,
is duplicity and deceit.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.936
- I think it's
actually Pappy's organs.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.503
- Sam, you're kind of messing
with my flow right now.

06:13.547 --> 06:15.505
Point is, I was examining
the body,

06:15.549 --> 06:17.594
and I found something.

06:17.638 --> 06:20.771
Classic ulceration
and desquamation of the mouth.

06:20.815 --> 06:23.208
Telltale signs
of poisoning.

06:24.296 --> 06:25.733
- In other words...

06:25.776 --> 06:28.344
What we have ourselves here

06:28.388 --> 06:31.608
is a good
ol' fashioned murder...

06:31.652 --> 06:33.480
- Oh, no.

06:33.523 --> 06:34.959
- Of a man
who you all loved dearly.

06:35.003 --> 06:36.178
I shouldn't have done
the "Knives Out" accent.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.617
- All right.
A man has been poisoned,

06:40.661 --> 06:42.053
his will is missing,

06:42.097 --> 06:43.011
and there's only one person
who stands to profit.

06:43.054 --> 06:44.186
Lyndon Boyle.

06:44.229 --> 06:45.622
- Lyndon's not a killer.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.407
- I mean, he did skip a Boyle
family Zoom last summer.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.451
- Yeah, it's true.

06:48.495 --> 06:49.626
It's seven hours out
of your day.

06:49.670 --> 06:50.932
How hard is that to fit in?

06:50.975 --> 06:53.151
- Okay, let's set up
an interrogation room.

06:53.195 --> 06:55.719
I wanna make this guy as
uncomfortable as possible.

06:57.460 --> 06:58.722
I thought we were going
for uncomfortable.

06:58.766 --> 07:00.028
What's with the rocking chair?

07:00.071 --> 07:01.899
- It's a farm.
All the chairs are rockers.

07:01.943 --> 07:04.206
But don't worry,
I under-steeped the tea.

07:04.249 --> 07:06.469
- Ugh.
It's so weak.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.036
Why am I being treated
like a criminal?

07:08.079 --> 07:09.254
- Okay.
I stand corrected.

07:09.298 --> 07:11.213
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

07:11.256 --> 07:13.302
Tell us about your last contact
with your father.

07:13.345 --> 07:14.477
- Pappy?

07:14.521 --> 07:15.478
Well, I saw him
at his birthday party.

07:15.522 --> 07:16.697
- Mm-hmm.
And was there anything

07:16.740 --> 07:17.698
unusual about that night?

07:17.741 --> 07:18.873
- Nothing unusual at all.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.527
We ate a pig
from snout to anus,

07:20.570 --> 07:23.007
and then took turns giving
each other head massages.

07:23.051 --> 07:25.053
<i>I was tired.
So I found Pappy,</i>

07:25.096 --> 07:26.315
<i>wished him a happy birthday.</i>

07:26.358 --> 07:27.969
<i>We hugged
for six minutes.</i>

07:28.012 --> 07:29.710
It was the last time
I saw him alive.

07:31.799 --> 07:32.887
- Did you see those tears?

07:32.930 --> 07:33.888
No way he did it.

07:33.931 --> 07:34.932
- Are you serious?

07:34.976 --> 07:36.281
Anyone can fake cry.

07:36.325 --> 07:37.761
You just have
to think of something sad.

07:37.805 --> 07:39.720
Like that episode of
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"

07:39.763 --> 07:40.764
when Leonardo was in a coma.

07:40.808 --> 07:41.722
- And that works?

07:41.765 --> 07:42.766
- Yeah.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.115
Yeah, it does.

07:44.159 --> 07:45.421
Now, come on.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.944
Let's go poke some holes
in Lyndon's story.

07:46.988 --> 07:50.208
- It was such a great party.
Everyone had the best time.

07:50.252 --> 07:51.253
I mean, except for Lyndon.

07:51.296 --> 07:52.254
- Lyndon wasn't happy?

07:52.297 --> 07:53.516
- Yeah, it was strange.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.126
<i>He was passing
through the living room.</i>

07:55.170 --> 07:57.302
<i>I asked him
if he wanted a little HJ.</i>

07:57.346 --> 07:58.652
<i>But he just ignored me.</i>

07:58.695 --> 08:00.958
<i>I mean, who doesn't want
an HJ from their cousin?</i>

08:01.002 --> 08:02.307
<i>- Hold up.
An HJ?</i>

08:02.351 --> 08:04.527
- A head job.
A massage.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.789
Isn't that what
everyone calls it?

08:05.833 --> 08:06.964
- You bet.
- Absolutely not.

08:07.008 --> 08:08.618
- Okay, so why
was Lyndon angry?

08:08.662 --> 08:11.012
- I bet it was whatever
Pappy said to him.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.230
- Wait.
What Pappy said when?

08:12.274 --> 08:13.318
- When they were
in Pappy's study.

08:13.362 --> 08:14.668
<i>We heard raised voices.</i>

08:14.711 --> 08:16.278
<i>And then Lyndon said...
- Good night.</i>

08:16.321 --> 08:17.453
<i>- Walked out of the room,</i>

08:17.497 --> 08:18.933
<i>and closed the door
behind him.</i>

08:18.976 --> 08:20.717
- That's all he said?
Good night?

08:20.761 --> 08:22.545
Gentlemen...

08:22.589 --> 08:24.591
I just solved this case.

08:24.634 --> 08:27.289
- Sir, if you wanna get a date
off of these sites,

08:27.332 --> 08:28.638
you're gonna have
to give me a little more

08:28.682 --> 08:29.813
from your profile photo.

08:29.857 --> 08:32.163
- I just gave you
a series of eight poses,

08:32.207 --> 08:34.775
each increasing
in sexual provocativeness

08:34.818 --> 08:35.950
by one-eighth.

08:35.993 --> 08:37.560
If you wanted septiles
or deciles

08:37.604 --> 08:39.214
of sexiness,
you should've told me.

08:39.257 --> 08:40.955
-
- What?

08:40.998 --> 08:42.304
Why do you care
so much, Santiago?

08:42.347 --> 08:43.610
I thought you didn't like
the idea of me dating.

08:43.653 --> 08:44.785
- Yes, initially.

08:44.828 --> 08:47.309
But then I thought
about your metaphor

08:47.352 --> 08:49.093
about how relationships
are like a chess match.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.965
- Mm-hmm.
- And it really convinced me.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.270
- That was
a strong observation.

08:52.314 --> 08:55.012
- So why don't you think
of this profile photo

08:55.056 --> 08:57.232
as an epic chess move?

08:57.275 --> 09:01.105
- Like Vladimirov's
Thunderbolt of 1987.

09:01.149 --> 09:02.454
Close the door, Diaz.

09:02.498 --> 09:05.414
I'm removing my collar stays.

09:05.457 --> 09:06.633
<i>- Why am I back here?</i>

09:06.676 --> 09:09.026
Like I told you,
it was a typical night.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.375
- Right.
Cousin kissing circle,

09:10.419 --> 09:11.812
everyone gets burped
after dinner--

09:11.855 --> 09:12.987
normal stuff.

09:13.030 --> 09:13.944
But let's talk about
what happened

09:13.988 --> 09:15.729
after the burping,
shall we?

09:15.772 --> 09:17.034
- What are you getting at?

09:17.078 --> 09:18.122
What exactly do you think
happened that night?

09:18.166 --> 09:19.733
- I'm so glad you asked.

09:19.776 --> 09:22.344
<i>I think Pappy called you
into his study</i>

09:22.387 --> 09:24.172
<i>and told you he was cutting
you out of his will.</i>

09:24.215 --> 09:26.348
<i>Tempers flared.
Voices were raised.</i>

09:26.391 --> 09:27.523
- What? <i>
- You were furious</i>

09:27.567 --> 09:28.611
<i>you wouldn't
be inheriting the farm.</i>

09:28.655 --> 09:29.743
- I don't even
want the farm.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.745
I've always been more
of a city boy.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.050
I live in Poughkeepsie.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.182
- Well, I guess
that settles it.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.664
- Except you didn't
say I love you.

09:37.707 --> 09:38.795
- Excuse me?

09:38.839 --> 09:39.927
- When you left,
you said "good night."

09:39.970 --> 09:41.450
You didn't say
"I love you."

09:41.493 --> 09:43.060
Now, you may be a black sheep,
but you're still a Boyle.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.540
And a Boyle always says
"I love you."

09:44.584 --> 09:46.020
- Not always.
- Look around you.

09:46.063 --> 09:47.543
It's written everywhere.

09:50.372 --> 09:52.026
- Okay, fine.
We were fighting.

09:52.069 --> 09:53.680
But not over the will.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.682
Pappy was mad at me for missing
that Zoom call this summer.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.901
- I mean honestly, Lyndon, what
did you expect would happen?

09:57.945 --> 10:00.121
- He said I was a disgrace
to the Boyle name.

10:00.164 --> 10:01.513
So I didn't say "I love you."

10:01.557 --> 10:03.080
I just stormed out
to the shed.

10:03.124 --> 10:05.039
I went to get
the Grandmother Dough.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.693
- The Grandmother Dough?

10:06.736 --> 10:07.955
<i>- Here it is.</i>

10:07.998 --> 10:10.914
The original Boyle family
sourdough starter,

10:10.958 --> 10:12.699
the mother
of the mother dough.

10:12.742 --> 10:14.309
It's still good,
but the lid on the jar

10:14.352 --> 10:15.963
has been stuck
for over a hundred years.

10:16.006 --> 10:19.662
- There's an old family legend
that it can only be opened by

10:19.706 --> 10:21.490
The One True Boyle.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.665
- I wanted to show
my dad that I was

10:22.709 --> 10:24.058
not a disgrace
to the family.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.102
But I couldn't budge it.

10:25.146 --> 10:26.147
Maybe he was right.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.844
- Oh, Lyndon.
What a tale.

10:27.888 --> 10:30.760
But I don't think that's why
you came in this barn at all.

10:30.804 --> 10:31.892
I think you came in here

10:31.935 --> 10:33.023
for this.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.242
- Is that nutria poison?

10:34.285 --> 10:36.723
- It's rat poison.
Nutria are pets.

10:36.766 --> 10:37.985
You psychopath.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.726
- Ah.
Nitrobenzene.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.597
That causes the exact type
of ulcers

10:41.641 --> 10:43.512
we found
in Pappy Boyle's mouth.

10:43.555 --> 10:46.428
And look what we have here.

10:46.471 --> 10:49.387
A single brown hair,

10:49.431 --> 10:50.998
belonging to the murderer.

10:51.041 --> 10:53.304
Terry, please send this off
to the local police station

10:53.348 --> 10:54.697
for a DNA test.

10:54.741 --> 10:57.831
Now all we need is one
of your hairs, Lyndon.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.006
- I didn't kill my father.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.268
Why am I being singled out?

11:00.311 --> 11:01.704
- Why not take a hair
from every Boyle

11:01.748 --> 11:03.445
so Cousin Lyndon
doesn't feel that way?

11:03.488 --> 11:05.099
- Sure, great idea.
I'll go first.

11:05.142 --> 11:07.057
- I mean it's more work for the
lab, but it's fine with me.

11:07.101 --> 11:09.494
Are you okay
with that, Lyndon?

11:09.538 --> 11:10.931
- Oh, wow.
Went with a nose hair.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.019
Didn't see
that coming.

11:12.062 --> 11:13.237
But it's definitely
long enough.

11:13.281 --> 11:15.283
- No.

11:15.326 --> 11:16.806
- Okay, sir.
This app's pretty simple.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.634
If you don't like the guy's
profile, you click "dang,"

11:18.678 --> 11:20.288
and if you do,
you click "daaang."

11:20.331 --> 11:21.419
- That sounds
needlessly confusing.

11:21.463 --> 11:22.377
- Why?
"dang" is bad

11:22.420 --> 11:23.421
and "daaang" is good.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.336
- Okay, let's thin this herd.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.251
Untucked shirt,
no thank you.

11:27.295 --> 11:29.776
Born in San Diego, yikes.

11:29.819 --> 11:31.299
An adult named Todd?

11:31.342 --> 11:33.780
So this is what
online dating is like?

11:33.823 --> 11:35.042
I didn't realize.

11:35.085 --> 11:36.304
- Realize how good
you have it with Kevin?

11:36.347 --> 11:37.740
- No, how it hasn't changed.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.047
You still have
to pick someone based on looks

11:40.090 --> 11:41.135
and hope
for a connection later.

11:41.178 --> 11:42.658
Oh, Lord, help me.

11:42.702 --> 11:43.615
I'm going for it.

11:43.659 --> 11:44.704
I'm clicking "dang."
- No.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.270
"Dang" is bad.
Click "daaang."

11:46.314 --> 11:48.055
- Why is this so confusing?

11:48.098 --> 11:50.057
How do I get Hot Todd back?

11:50.100 --> 11:52.146
- DNA results are in.

11:52.189 --> 11:53.321
- Ooh, and?
Who did it?

11:53.364 --> 11:54.278
It was Lyndon, right?

11:54.322 --> 11:55.802
- Hair is...

11:55.845 --> 11:57.151
"rodent in origin."

11:57.194 --> 11:58.065
- What?
Doesn't make any sense.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.109
Here, forward it to me.

11:59.153 --> 12:00.371
- Must've been a nutria hair.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.199
Those things are everywhere.
Ugh.

12:02.243 --> 12:03.331
- Wait a minute.
This is weird.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.811
According to the DNA results,

12:04.854 --> 12:07.248
everyone in the Boyle family
is related except one.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.205
- Lyndon?
- No.

12:08.249 --> 12:09.554
- Charles.

12:10.294 --> 12:11.861
- Charles Boyle

12:11.905 --> 12:13.341
isn't a Boyle.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.867
- That DNA test has
to be wrong.

12:17.911 --> 12:20.087
I mean, Charles is the most
Boyle-y of all the Boyles.

12:20.130 --> 12:21.653
- You know what?
I'm gonna call Charles' dad,

12:21.697 --> 12:23.003
get to the bottom of this.

12:25.135 --> 12:27.094
Hey, Lynn?
It's Jake.

12:27.137 --> 12:28.835
Hi.
Hey, can I ask you

12:28.878 --> 12:30.750
about Charles' paternity
real quick?

12:31.968 --> 12:33.404
All right.
Thanks, Lynn. Bye.

12:33.448 --> 12:34.797
- What on Earth
took so long?

12:34.841 --> 12:36.146
- Well, the first five hours

12:36.190 --> 12:38.279
was mostly just sobbing
and gasping for air.

12:38.322 --> 12:41.064
Then he told me
that Charles' mom had an affair

12:41.108 --> 12:42.544
with a rival florist.

12:42.587 --> 12:44.154
Lynn always suspected
he might've been Charles' dad,

12:44.198 --> 12:46.156
but he decided he loved him
so much, it didn't matter.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.462
- I don't understand.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.377
Charles looks just like all
the other Boyles.

12:49.420 --> 12:50.595
- Apparently that's
not genetic.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.336
The Boyles cuddle
their children so much,

12:52.380 --> 12:53.685
it shapes
their bones that way.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.862
He likened it to how they
grow square watermelons.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.037
- Oh, my God.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.125
We can't tell Charles.

12:58.168 --> 12:59.691
- You wanna lie
to our dear friend

12:59.735 --> 13:01.389
about the one thing
that's most important to him

13:01.432 --> 13:03.304
in the whole world?

13:03.347 --> 13:04.871
- Yes.
- Okay, good, me too.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.437
Now all we have to do is prove
that Cousin Lyndon is

13:06.481 --> 13:09.049
the murderer before Charles
asks about the DNA results.

13:09.092 --> 13:10.050
- Hi, guys.

13:10.093 --> 13:11.399
- Ah.
Hey, man.

13:11.442 --> 13:12.400
Where'd you come from?

13:12.443 --> 13:13.749
- I slinked up.

13:13.793 --> 13:14.881
- You know how good
Boyles are at slinking.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.578
It's because
of our fleshy toe pads.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.406
- Right.
And you, Charles,

13:18.449 --> 13:20.408
have said fleshy toe pads

13:20.451 --> 13:21.757
because you are a Boyle,

13:21.801 --> 13:25.848
from snout to anus.

13:25.892 --> 13:28.024
- "A Boyle from snout
to anus."

13:28.068 --> 13:29.069
That is so sweet.

13:29.112 --> 13:30.418
I'm stealing that
for the eulogy.

13:30.461 --> 13:31.854
- Ah, you don't have to.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.334
<i>- Huh.</i>

13:33.377 --> 13:34.596
It's the exact time we agreed
to meet for our date,

13:34.639 --> 13:35.553
and he's not here.

13:35.597 --> 13:36.728
- I'm sorry.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.165
I know how you
value punctuality.

13:38.208 --> 13:39.296
- In my employees.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.342
But in potential suitors,
I don't mind

13:41.385 --> 13:42.647
one or two minutes
of tardiness.

13:42.691 --> 13:44.606
I like a bad boy.

13:44.649 --> 13:45.999
Now, if you'll excuse me,

13:46.042 --> 13:48.262
I'm going to go to the bathroom
to wash my hands,

13:48.305 --> 13:50.307
in case we shake.

13:50.351 --> 13:52.483
- Ooh.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.442
I thought the point was
for Holt to bail

13:54.485 --> 13:55.617
before he got
to an actual date.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.184
- It is.
But this works too.

13:57.227 --> 13:58.794
I mean, did you see
the dude he matched with?

13:58.838 --> 13:59.969
He calls himself a doctor,

14:00.013 --> 14:01.753
but he's actually
a chiropractor.

14:01.797 --> 14:04.234
- Are we sure Holt doesn't
respect chiropractors?

14:06.976 --> 14:08.151
I'm kidding.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.979
Ooh.
There's Todd.

14:11.241 --> 14:12.329
- And here's Holt.

14:12.373 --> 14:13.896
Started off strong,
nice big smile.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.116
Oh, not anymore.
He just noticed Todd's loafers.

14:16.159 --> 14:17.595
- Oh, Todd, you fool.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.946
Holt thinks any shoes
without laces are flip-flops.

14:19.989 --> 14:22.644
- Now the moment that will send
Holt running toward the exit.

14:22.687 --> 14:24.602
When he asks Todd
what he would like to drink,

14:24.646 --> 14:26.300
Todd orders,
"Whatever you're having."

14:26.343 --> 14:29.520
- Oh Todd, you fool.
Have your own opinion.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.958
Wait a second.
Are they gonna sit down?

14:32.001 --> 14:33.046
In a booth?

14:33.089 --> 14:34.090
Oh, no, Rosa.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.178
Todd's not the fool.

14:35.222 --> 14:36.701
We're the fools.

14:37.789 --> 14:38.878
- I have eyes on the package.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.140
<i>He's headed towards you.</i>

14:40.183 --> 14:41.402
- I'm on it. <i>
- Seriously, guys,</i>

14:41.445 --> 14:42.533
<i>why are we doing this?</i>

14:42.577 --> 14:44.187
We should just wait
for the DNA test.

14:44.231 --> 14:45.449
- We will.

14:45.493 --> 14:46.581
But the lab said
it would take a week.

14:46.624 --> 14:48.452
They had to get
a new tech.

14:48.496 --> 14:49.845
- Oh, no.
Why?

14:49.889 --> 14:53.153
The old one had
a bad allergic reaction to...

14:53.196 --> 14:54.589
beakers. <i>
- Ugh.</i>

14:54.632 --> 14:56.156
Labs are full of them.
That's awful.

14:56.199 --> 14:57.592
- Yeah, and real.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.550
Anyways, since Lyndon
is our only actual suspect,

14:59.594 --> 15:01.161
we might as well investigate.

15:01.204 --> 15:02.423
- Let me ask you this.
Is he gushing?

15:02.466 --> 15:03.641
- Don't say those words.

15:03.685 --> 15:04.947
- The pressure
of keeping secrets

15:04.991 --> 15:06.688
makes Boyles stress-sweat.

15:06.731 --> 15:08.037
<i>Once, we played Mafia,</i>

15:08.081 --> 15:10.387
and you'd never seen
so many dripping wet cousins

15:10.431 --> 15:11.736
in one room.
- Come on.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.434
- Wait.
He's leaving the property.

15:13.477 --> 15:14.696
- Can you stay with him?

15:14.739 --> 15:15.915
- Yeah.
I think so.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.220
I just have to get
around the barn and--

15:18.308 --> 15:20.180
- Terr-bear?

15:20.223 --> 15:21.877
- I'm sorry.
I was following Lyndon

15:21.921 --> 15:24.097
and I crawled
into that thing.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.402
- That thing has a name.

15:25.446 --> 15:26.664
- It's Muffin.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.057
- Well, thanks to Muffin,
we lost Lyndon.

15:28.101 --> 15:30.930
- Yes.
But also thanks to Muffin,

15:30.973 --> 15:33.845
I just solved the case
of who killed Pappy Boyle.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.891
- We're right here.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.024
- Yeah. I didn't think
it would feed back.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.461
- Oh, no, Rosa.
They're leaving together.

15:40.504 --> 15:41.418
What are we gonna do?

15:41.462 --> 15:42.637
- We stop them.

15:42.680 --> 15:43.681
Even if it means we have
to kill Todd.

15:43.725 --> 15:46.162
- Smart.
Let's go.

15:46.206 --> 15:47.076
- Looking for someone?

15:47.120 --> 15:49.470
- Sir.
Uh, what's going on?

15:49.513 --> 15:52.038
- What's going on is that you
were trying to manipulate me,

15:52.081 --> 15:54.127
but it is I
who manipulated you.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.258
How does it feel

15:55.302 --> 15:58.174
to suckle from
your own tainted teat?

15:58.218 --> 15:59.871
- Not as bad as it feels
to hear you say "suckle."

15:59.915 --> 16:02.352
- So you were never really
going home with Todd?

16:02.396 --> 16:05.312
- You actually think I would
have relations with him?

16:05.355 --> 16:07.183
His watch has a cloth strap.

16:07.227 --> 16:08.358
- I really thought
we had something.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.186
- Wake up, Todd.
I'm out of your league.

16:10.230 --> 16:12.667
You thought you could meddle
in my personal life,

16:12.710 --> 16:15.539
but I was ten moves ahead
the whole time.

16:15.583 --> 16:16.714
And now, checkmate.

16:16.758 --> 16:17.933
- Ooh.
I love chess.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.195
Have you seen
"The Queen's Gambit"?

16:19.239 --> 16:21.589
It's a TV show.
- Todd, I swear to God.

16:21.632 --> 16:24.287
- The person who killed Pappy
wasn't a person at all.

16:24.331 --> 16:25.549
It was Muffin.

16:25.593 --> 16:26.942
- I checked her mouth,

16:26.986 --> 16:29.031
and Muffin had the same ulcers
that Pappy had.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.381
Muffin ate the poison,
and then Pappy drank her milk.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.296
- Charles, you said nutria
could open doors.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.342
Muffin must've let herself
into the barn.

16:35.385 --> 16:36.952
- Which explains why we found
her hair on the box.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.736
- So Lyndon was innocent.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.564
- Wait, how did you know
it was Muffin's hair?

16:40.608 --> 16:42.044
Did you get
the DNA report back?

16:42.088 --> 16:43.263
- Exactly.
- Wait, but I thought

16:43.306 --> 16:44.612
the report was gonna
take a week

16:44.655 --> 16:45.787
because of
the lab tech's allergies.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.093
- Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

16:47.136 --> 16:48.877
But then they decided
to use a subcontractor

16:48.920 --> 16:50.357
who was allergy-free,
so let's just move on

16:50.400 --> 16:51.619
and talk about
something else immediately.

16:51.662 --> 16:52.794
Three "uh-huh's"?

16:52.837 --> 16:54.665
Clearly you're lying
about something.

16:54.709 --> 16:55.797
- Why you being a jerk to me?

16:55.840 --> 16:57.103
- Show me the report, Jake.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.843
- Okay, fine.
But just look at the top result

16:58.887 --> 17:01.063
'cause that's all
that matters.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.804
"Specimen hair was rodent
in nature."

17:02.847 --> 17:04.458
and that's that.

17:04.501 --> 17:07.635
- Oh, my God.

17:07.678 --> 17:09.158
I'm not a Boyle.

17:11.726 --> 17:13.858
- Okay.
I love you too, Dad.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.034
Did you guys change clothes?

17:15.077 --> 17:16.731
- Yeah, Charles.
It's tomorrow now.

17:16.774 --> 17:18.472
You been on the phone
for 14 hours.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.169
- Well, you know
what they say,

17:20.213 --> 17:22.389
"Time flies when God
pulls down his pants

17:22.432 --> 17:24.217
and takes a dump
on your life."

17:24.260 --> 17:25.870
- Oh, buddy.
I'm so sorry.

17:25.914 --> 17:28.395
- Being a Boyle was
the backbone of my identity.

17:28.438 --> 17:31.224
Without the Boyle backbone,
I'm just a bag of flesh.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.182
I'm goo.
- Come on, you're not goo.

17:33.226 --> 17:34.836
Being a Boyle is about more
than blood.

17:34.879 --> 17:36.011
It's what's in your heart.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.447
- Blood is what's in
your heart.

17:37.491 --> 17:38.753
You're making it worse, Jake.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.233
- Okay, fine.
Then what about Nikolaj?

17:40.276 --> 17:41.582
He was adopted, so technically,

17:41.625 --> 17:43.192
he's not a Boyle,
but that never bothered you.

17:43.236 --> 17:44.585
- I didn't even think
about Niko.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.848
He was already a Boyle
once removed

17:46.891 --> 17:49.068
which is tough enough.
Now he's twice removed?

17:49.111 --> 17:51.722
Twice-removed Boyles
are a total clown show,

17:51.766 --> 17:55.204
okay?
Niko's basically Cousin Andrea.

17:55.248 --> 17:57.119
Sorry, Andrea.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.556
- I know what I am.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.254
- Well, damn.
- Look, let's go home.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.125
- We're leaving?
What about the funeral?

18:03.169 --> 18:04.257
What about the eulogy?

18:04.300 --> 18:05.562
- I don't feel right
giving it now.

18:05.606 --> 18:07.999
Sam offered to step in.
I'll have him do it.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.479
- No, no, no.
Wait.

18:09.523 --> 18:10.785
Assemble the cousins.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.743
Today, we learned
that Pappy Boyle's death

18:12.787 --> 18:13.875
was not foul play.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.877
But even though
there was no murder,

18:15.920 --> 18:17.226
there was a robbery.

18:17.270 --> 18:19.881
Charles had his sense
of self stolen from him

18:19.924 --> 18:21.187
by Sam Boyle.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.840
You said it yourself, Charles,

18:22.884 --> 18:25.147
the Boyles have a long history
of cousin-on-cousin jealousy.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.845
Sam couldn't stand that you
were chosen to give the eulogy.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.456
Think about it.

18:29.499 --> 18:30.979
<i>It was Sam who made sure we
knew the will was missing.</i>

18:31.022 --> 18:33.286
- We can't find Pappy's will.

18:33.329 --> 18:36.463
<i>- Then Sam again who suggested
you all get your DNA tested.</i>

18:36.506 --> 18:38.769
- Why not take a hair
from every Boyle?

18:38.813 --> 18:41.598
<i>- And finally, Sam who made
sure we all knew the results.</i>

18:41.642 --> 18:43.600
- Did you get
the DNA report back?

18:43.644 --> 18:45.907
This is ridiculous.
I love Charles.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.300
- Okay, well then.

18:47.343 --> 18:48.562
I'm sure you wouldn't mind
giving him a hug then.

18:48.605 --> 18:49.824
Since you love him so much.

18:49.867 --> 18:53.088
- Sure.
I always like to hug my cousin.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.655
- He's gushing!

18:54.698 --> 18:55.569
- Darn it.

18:55.612 --> 18:57.266
I thought these would hide it,

18:57.310 --> 18:59.660
but I gushed
through my pit diapers.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.052
All right, fine.

19:01.096 --> 19:03.359
I always suspected
that Charles wasn't one of us.

19:03.403 --> 19:05.405
I mean, he went
through puberty at 13,

19:05.448 --> 19:07.015
instead of 25,

19:07.058 --> 19:08.843
like a normal Boyle.

19:08.886 --> 19:12.020
And when he got chosen
to give the eulogy,

19:12.063 --> 19:13.848
something inside
of me snapped.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.197
So I hid the will.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.459
I admit it.

19:16.503 --> 19:17.504
Are you happy now?

19:17.547 --> 19:18.766
- Very.
- Not at all.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.637
- Wait, what?
Charles, we solved the case.

19:20.681 --> 19:22.813
He confessed.
- Doesn't matter.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.511
I'm still not a Boyle.

19:24.554 --> 19:28.210
I'm just a normal person.

19:28.254 --> 19:30.560
Normal from snout to anus.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.522
- We wanted to apologize.

19:35.565 --> 19:38.307
- And if you wanna gloat
about how you outsmarted us,

19:38.351 --> 19:39.787
go ahead.
We deserve it.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.571
- I won't be doing
any gloating.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.573
I mean, I did last night.
I went home and had a drink

19:43.617 --> 19:45.880
to toast to your humiliation.

19:45.923 --> 19:46.968
But it didn't feel right,

19:47.011 --> 19:48.143
because I had no one
to toast with,

19:48.187 --> 19:49.536
no one to share my glee.

19:49.579 --> 19:53.931
I had won,
but I was alone.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.716
And I realized,

19:55.759 --> 19:58.414
this is exactly what
I'm doing to Kevin.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.808
Trying to win therapy.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.244
And it hit me.

20:02.288 --> 20:06.248
I care so much about winning

20:06.292 --> 20:09.643
that I've lost everything.

20:09.686 --> 20:11.732
- Tell Kevin how you feel.

20:11.775 --> 20:14.387
- It's raining.
You could run to him.

20:14.430 --> 20:15.866
- This is the real world,
Santiago.

20:15.910 --> 20:19.870
Relationships end
in unsatisfying ways every day.

20:19.914 --> 20:21.872
People don't run
to each other in the rain.

20:21.916 --> 20:24.266
<i>- Raymond!
Raymond Holt!</i>

20:24.310 --> 20:26.355
- Kevin?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.880
- Raymond!

20:35.321 --> 20:37.061
Raymond, am I too late?

20:37.105 --> 20:38.411
- Too late?

20:38.454 --> 20:39.847
- My friend saw
your dating profile

20:39.890 --> 20:42.023
and your photo
without collar stays.

20:42.066 --> 20:44.286
I thought I'd lost you.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.333
- You will never lose me.

20:47.376 --> 20:48.769
I'll do anything
to keep you.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.988
I'll compromise on everything.
The work, the--

20:54.209 --> 21:01.303
<i>♪</i>

21:02.348 --> 21:05.525
- Nancy Meyers never fails.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.875
- Now that we're doing it,
it feels kinda weird

21:07.918 --> 21:09.616
to be staring at your friends
while they kiss.

21:09.659 --> 21:12.358
- Are you kidding?
It's beautiful.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.360

Let's go home.

21:22.063 --> 21:23.369
- Charles, I'm sorry.

21:23.412 --> 21:24.761
I feel like
this was all my fault.

21:24.805 --> 21:26.328
- Why?
Did you inseminate my mother?

21:26.372 --> 21:27.590
- What?
Ew, no.

21:27.634 --> 21:29.766
- Don't say ew.
She's my one blood relation.

21:29.810 --> 21:32.203
Remember, I'm not
a real Boyle.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.727
- Okay, fine.

21:33.770 --> 21:34.989
Maybe you're not
a real Boyle.

21:35.032 --> 21:36.033
But what if

21:36.077 --> 21:37.034
you're a true Boyle?

21:37.078 --> 21:38.471
What if

21:38.514 --> 21:39.863
you're The One True Boyle?

21:39.907 --> 21:41.125
- No, no.
You want me to open

21:41.169 --> 21:42.126
the Grandmother Dough.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.302
That jar is stuck shut.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.955
Nobody's ever been able
to do it.

21:44.999 --> 21:46.348
- But you have to try.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.568
Terry, go grab it.

21:48.611 --> 21:51.875
All right, now let's reassemble
those cousins.

21:53.050 --> 21:54.661
- I'm not gonna
be able to do this,

21:54.704 --> 21:56.489
and I'm gonna be
even more humiliated.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.752
- Just try.
I believe in you.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.408
So did you loosen it?

22:02.451 --> 22:03.713
- I tried, but it's slippery,

22:03.757 --> 22:04.671
and that thing
is sealed on tight.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.150
I couldn't budge it.

22:06.194 --> 22:08.544
- Oh, no.
Uh, hey, Charles.

22:08.588 --> 22:10.198
Remember when I said
that I believed in you?

22:10.241 --> 22:11.417
- Yes.

22:11.460 --> 22:12.374
It's the entire reason
I'm doing this.

22:12.418 --> 22:14.289
- Oh.
Godspeed.

22:21.078 --> 22:27.955
<i>♪</i>

22:28.825 --> 22:29.957
- Ah!

22:30.000 --> 22:30.827
I did it!

22:30.871 --> 22:32.394
- He's The One True Boyle.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.268
- Oh, my God.
What is that stench?

22:37.312 --> 22:38.574
It's the Grandmother Dough.

22:38.618 --> 22:39.706
- It smells horrible.

22:39.749 --> 22:42.404
- Not to a Boyle.

22:42.448 --> 22:45.712
Pappy's hugs were long
and firm.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.061
- Okay, here's what I think
might've happened.

22:47.104 --> 22:49.193
You loosened the jar,
but you didn't realize it

22:49.237 --> 22:50.325
because you're a Godzilla man,

22:50.369 --> 22:51.848
and you don't know
your own strength.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.546
- First of all, thank you
for calling me a Godzilla man.

22:53.589 --> 22:55.025
- Yeah.
- Secondly, that's not it.

22:55.069 --> 22:56.679
The jar was too slippery.
- All right, how about this?

22:56.723 --> 22:58.464
Charles was so freaked out
about not being a Boyle

22:58.507 --> 23:00.988
that he got an adrenaline rush,
and that made him stronger.

23:01.031 --> 23:02.946
- Or maybe Charles
is the One True Boyle.

23:02.990 --> 23:05.209
- And I know that Pappy's
up there

23:05.253 --> 23:07.429
shopping for beige slacks

23:07.473 --> 23:10.693
at that Mervyn's in the sky.

23:10.737 --> 23:13.392
Ah, Mervyn's!

23:13.435 --> 23:14.915
- Yeah, he's
the One True Boyle.

23:14.958 --> 23:17.091
<i>- Not a doctor.
Shh.</i>

23:17.134 --> 23:18.571
