00:33.002 --> 00:36.369
Well, you obviously enjoyed
that sandwich, John Redcorn.

00:36.405 --> 00:37.372
Now let me tell you

00:37.406 --> 00:39.840
about a different kind of
sandwich you might enjoy.

00:39.876 --> 00:42.538
At Strickland Propane,
we offer our customers

00:42.578 --> 00:45.274
a sandwich of excellent service.

00:45.314 --> 00:46.406
The meat...

00:46.449 --> 00:49.577
Hank, I'm sure
your propane is wonderful,

00:49.619 --> 00:51.587
but the reason
I met you for lunch

00:51.621 --> 00:52.588
is because I'm worried

00:52.622 --> 00:54.590
about the way Dale
is raising my son.

00:54.624 --> 00:56.023
Okay, easy there.

00:56.058 --> 00:57.650
Joseph is Dale's son,

00:57.693 --> 00:59.854
and you have nothing
to worry about.

00:59.896 --> 01:01.261
Joseph's a good kid.

01:01.297 --> 01:02.764
Heck, he's Bobby's
best friend.

01:02.798 --> 01:04.822
I saw him unscrewing
saltshaker tops

01:04.867 --> 01:05.925
at the food court.

01:05.968 --> 01:08.027
He ruined an old man's
taco salad.

01:08.070 --> 01:09.697
Well, you know
how boys are.

01:09.739 --> 01:12.765
Yes, but there comes a time
in every boy's life

01:12.808 --> 01:15.606
when he must decide
to be good or bad.

01:15.645 --> 01:20.480
And a big strong boy like Joseph
can be very good, or very bad.

01:20.516 --> 01:22.484
He needs a vision quest
to guide him.

01:22.518 --> 01:23.485
Vision quest?

01:23.519 --> 01:26.113
All cultures have
a similar rite of passage.

01:26.155 --> 01:28.146
Your people have a bar mitzvah.

01:28.191 --> 01:29.988
Uh, we're not Jewish.

01:30.026 --> 01:30.993
Really?

01:31.027 --> 01:32.722
Look, if Joseph
needs something,

01:32.762 --> 01:36.562
Dale's his father,
and he's going to
take care of it.

01:38.668 --> 01:39.930
Come on, guess.

01:39.969 --> 01:42.802
Bear or raccoon?

01:42.838 --> 01:44.328
I don't know. Bear?

01:44.373 --> 01:46.603
Ha! Trick question.

01:46.642 --> 01:48.439
No one knows if the giant panda

01:48.477 --> 01:52.470
is really a member
of the bear or raccoon family.

01:52.515 --> 01:55.040
Tomorrow is going
to be the coolest
field trip ever.

01:55.084 --> 01:56.676
Cooler than
the science museum

01:56.719 --> 01:58.687
when Miss Cooper's
shirt fell open?

01:58.721 --> 02:00.450
Is that what all
the laughter was?

02:00.523 --> 02:02.252
I was in the giant ear.

02:02.925 --> 02:03.914
Uh-oh.

02:04.860 --> 02:07.385
Steve, Jake and Dave.

02:12.768 --> 02:14.326
Hey, Gribble and Tubby.

02:14.370 --> 02:17.066
Get your butts over here.
Now!

02:17.106 --> 02:21.805
Hey, would anybody recognize
gangrene if they saw it?

02:21.844 --> 02:23.675
Hey, Bobby,
where's Joseph?

02:23.713 --> 02:25.647
Stupid Joseph.

02:25.681 --> 02:27.979
What the heck was that about?

02:28.017 --> 02:29.917
Oh, it's a very
difficult age.

02:29.952 --> 02:30.976
Yeah, man,
I tell you what.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.988
You talking about
all them raging
hormones, man.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.683
Want to be a rebel
and still a kid, man.

02:34.724 --> 02:36.487
Talking about
who am I, man?

02:36.525 --> 02:37.457
(glass shattering)

02:37.493 --> 02:39.927
STEVE:
Oops.

02:44.133 --> 02:45.691
Well, what are you looking at?

02:45.735 --> 02:46.633
I don't know.

02:46.669 --> 02:48.899
But if it was a mirror,
I'd kill myself.

02:48.938 --> 02:50.303
(laughing)

02:50.339 --> 02:56.175
Whoa. Those were
the coolest kids
I've ever seen,

02:56.212 --> 02:58.612
and they appear to be
friends with my son.

02:58.648 --> 03:00.616
Dale, did you see
what they did

03:00.650 --> 03:02.140
to Bill's recyclables?

03:02.184 --> 03:03.481
Rude. Rude boys.

03:03.519 --> 03:05.214
Pish-tosh. What's the harm?

03:05.254 --> 03:06.551
The harm is

03:06.589 --> 03:08.716
a little saying that goes

03:08.758 --> 03:11.454
"One bad apple
spoils the bunch."

03:11.494 --> 03:13.462
Well, looks like a whole mess
of bad apples

03:13.496 --> 03:14.963
just got dumped on our kids.

03:14.997 --> 03:17.124
You know who'd be
a good influence?

03:17.166 --> 03:19.361
My son, Trey.

03:19.402 --> 03:23.133
Last week it was Travis.

03:23.172 --> 03:24.139
So?

03:24.173 --> 03:27.370
You're cutting
the field trip?

03:27.410 --> 03:32.939
You're going to get
in the hugest trouble
in the world.

03:35.718 --> 03:39.916
Give your little pandas
a shout-out for me.

03:40.556 --> 03:42.285
HANK:
Maybe Redcorn was right.

03:42.325 --> 03:44.850
Joseph's falling in
with the wrong crowd,

03:44.894 --> 03:47.192
and every group of bad kids

03:47.229 --> 03:49.197
needs a heavy boy
to be the lookout.

03:49.231 --> 03:51.028
And Bobby is so impressionable.

03:51.067 --> 03:53.194
I hope he has the strength
to stand up to him.

03:53.235 --> 03:54.497
Mom, Dad, I just saw

03:54.537 --> 03:57.131
the most incredible
fabric softener ad.

03:57.173 --> 03:59.164
Is the supermarket
still open?

03:59.208 --> 04:01.540
Peggy, keep him here.

04:03.045 --> 04:04.979
Did you know there
exists a softness

04:05.014 --> 04:08.950
beyond any softness
you've ever felt before?

04:10.653 --> 04:12.678
MAN (on phone):
Federal Reserve.
How may I direct your call?

04:12.722 --> 04:14.451
You don't know me,

04:14.490 --> 04:15.354
but I know what you're up to.

04:15.391 --> 04:19.521
NANCY:
Sorry, Dale, didn't know
you were on the phone.

04:19.562 --> 04:20.620
(gasps)

04:20.663 --> 04:23.291
Dale, I don't normally
go in for that

04:23.332 --> 04:25.197
"it takes a village" garbage,

04:25.234 --> 04:28.226
but you've got a situation
with your Joseph

04:28.270 --> 04:31.569
that I can't have
spilling over onto my Bobby.

04:31.607 --> 04:34.599
I know, Hank,
but what can I do?

04:34.643 --> 04:36.110
You can tell Joseph

04:36.145 --> 04:39.137
he's not-to hang around
those kids anymore.

04:39.181 --> 04:40.671
I can't do that.

04:40.716 --> 04:43.310
This is his chance to be cool,

04:43.352 --> 04:45.980
and you only get one chance,
Hank.

04:46.021 --> 04:47.215
I know.

04:47.256 --> 04:48.223
Whoa, there,
Gribble.

04:48.257 --> 04:49.224
Where's the fire?

04:49.258 --> 04:50.225
Say, "In our wife's pants."

04:50.259 --> 04:51.226
Say it.

04:51.260 --> 04:52.921
In your
wife's pants!

04:52.962 --> 04:56.227
(all laughing)

04:56.265 --> 05:00.759
In your wife’s pants!

05:00.803 --> 05:02.168
I won't do it.

05:02.204 --> 05:05.139
Those kids like Joseph,
and they're cool.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.141
They're really cool.

05:06.175 --> 05:09.269
Dang it, Dale, no one
likes being the bad guy,

05:09.311 --> 05:11.677
but sometimes that's
part of being a dad.

05:11.714 --> 05:13.204
I don’t want
to be a dad.

05:13.249 --> 05:14.307
It's too hard.

05:14.350 --> 05:16.250
Dale, you can't
just ignore...

05:16.285 --> 05:18.412
Yes? This is Dale.

05:18.454 --> 05:20.422
Dale, the phone
didn't even ring.

05:20.456 --> 05:22.424
How good of you
to return my call.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.722
Sorry, Hank, this
will have to wait.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.751
REDCORN:
Thank you for reconsidering

05:26.796 --> 05:27.888
a vision quest, Hank.

05:27.930 --> 05:29.488
You think it'll
fix Joseph?

05:29.532 --> 05:30.499
It fixed me.

05:30.533 --> 05:32.501
There aren't too
many former roadies

05:32.535 --> 05:34.503
who own their own
healing centers.

05:34.537 --> 05:36.505
So, how does one
of these things work?

05:36.539 --> 05:38.507
Think of a vision quest
as a purification process

05:38.541 --> 05:41.009
to read the bod and mind
to receive wisdom.

05:41.043 --> 05:42.010
(Indian flute plays)

05:42.044 --> 05:45.207
One prepares for a vision
by fasting for 24 hours...

05:45.247 --> 05:48.114
no food, no water, nothing.

05:48.150 --> 05:49.617
Then, one must push the bod

05:49.652 --> 05:52.052
to a point
of physical exhaustion.

05:52.087 --> 05:53.054
To achieve this,

05:53.088 --> 05:55.955
the seeker will often wander
the wilderness for man hours

05:55.991 --> 05:56.958
until he collapses.

05:56.992 --> 05:58.118
HANK:
Got it.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.627
No eating or drinking.

05:59.662 --> 06:01.926
Lots of hiking,
then he'll see something

06:01.964 --> 06:03.659
that'll make him okay?

06:03.699 --> 06:06.031
Hopefully.

06:06.068 --> 06:07.228
In my vision,

06:07.269 --> 06:09.499
I saw a majestic tree
blowing in the wind.

06:09.538 --> 06:11.438
But the tree had no roots,

06:11.474 --> 06:14.602
and was lifted up
and blown away.

06:14.643 --> 06:19.171
(playing hard rock music)

06:19.215 --> 06:21.080
Hey, Redcorn!
Green tube-top, row four!

06:21.116 --> 06:23.448
I knew then
that the tribal elders

06:23.486 --> 06:25.647
had interpreted
my vision correct,

06:25.688 --> 06:27.155
and that wrangling groupies
for Winger

06:27.189 --> 06:29.453
was no way to live my life.

06:29.492 --> 06:32.586
So, I was thinking
I would take him

06:32.628 --> 06:34.994
to Lake Buchanan
on Thursday.

06:35.030 --> 06:36.463
Yeah, uh, I'm not sure

06:36.499 --> 06:37.932
how well that's going
to work

06:37.967 --> 06:39.992
with the whole,
uh, keeping Dale

06:40.035 --> 06:42.128
from knowing
about your, uh...

06:42.171 --> 06:44.332
hand in
Joseph's creation.

06:44.373 --> 06:46.864
But, Hank, it's really important
that Joseph's vision

06:46.909 --> 06:48.774
be interpreted correctly
if it is to guide him

06:48.811 --> 06:50.904
to the proper life-path.

06:50.946 --> 06:52.004
Well, then, I guess

06:52.047 --> 06:54.038
I'll bring Dale
and the boys camping.

06:54.083 --> 06:57.382
Joseph will have a vision;
I'll report back with the dream,

06:57.419 --> 07:01.253
and you'll fill me in on
the sacred wisdom and whatnot.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.190
It is a fair
compromise.

07:03.225 --> 07:06.388
But, Hank, this is
an important ritual
among my people.

07:06.428 --> 07:07.793
Don't half-ass it.

07:07.830 --> 07:11.095
Hey, I never told you

07:11.133 --> 07:14.796
what a great time
you missed at the pandas.

07:14.837 --> 07:17.135
We got to eat
bamboo.

07:17.172 --> 07:19.504
Then Clark Peters
made a butt-crack

07:19.542 --> 07:20.873
out of his stomach fat,

07:20.910 --> 07:23.674
and a panda totally
looked right at him.

07:23.712 --> 07:24.679
Hil-arious!

07:24.713 --> 07:28.149
Plus, I got this.

07:28.183 --> 07:29.616
Her name is Pang-Ni,

07:29.652 --> 07:30.949
and when I
bought her,

07:30.986 --> 07:34.786
she was filled with
Chinese energy drink.

07:42.164 --> 07:45.793
You know, Joseph, uh,
and, Bobby, and, Dale,

07:45.834 --> 07:47.802
while we're here, it's important

07:47.836 --> 07:49.827
to listen to what
the land is telling us.

07:49.872 --> 07:53.831
Yep. You know, this land once
belonged to the Caddo tribe?

07:53.876 --> 07:56.845
And the story goes that they
once offended their spirits...

07:56.879 --> 07:58.938
Hey, speaking
of the red man.

07:58.981 --> 07:59.948
It's John Redcorn.

07:59.982 --> 08:03.440
Hey, what a co-inky-dink.

08:03.485 --> 08:05.544
All of us camping here,
pretty funny.

08:05.588 --> 08:06.213
Huh.

08:06.255 --> 08:09.088
Oh, you mean,
funny-weird.

08:09.124 --> 08:11.149
That is odd.

08:11.193 --> 08:12.353
Well, I won't
keep you.

08:12.394 --> 08:13.418
But, hey, remember
to listen

08:13.462 --> 08:15.327
to what the land
is telling you.

08:15.364 --> 08:17.059
Especially
Joseph.

08:17.099 --> 08:21.126
I don’t think
I've ever been hungrier.

08:21.170 --> 08:22.159
Yeah,
I never thought

08:22.204 --> 08:24.138
I could go this far
without food,

08:24.173 --> 08:25.970
but we’re doing it,
right, Dad?

08:26.008 --> 08:27.771
Give us some food, Hank!

08:27.810 --> 08:32.371
I'm starving.

08:32.414 --> 08:33.745
Oh, blast it.

08:33.782 --> 08:35.875
I think I left the food
back in the van.

08:35.918 --> 08:36.885
Blast it.

08:36.919 --> 08:43.256
(Dale and Bobby groan)

08:43.292 --> 08:48.195
(Dale gasping)

08:48.230 --> 08:52.166
Could you have picked
a site farther away, Hank?

08:52.201 --> 08:53.998
Yeah, what
was I thinking?

08:54.036 --> 08:56.971
Your problem is, you never
think about anything.

08:57.006 --> 09:02.467
(coughing and wheezing)

09:09.118 --> 09:10.813
Look alive, boy.

09:10.853 --> 09:13.048
Why can't we just go to sleep?

09:13.088 --> 09:14.385
Bears.

09:14.423 --> 09:17.017
Hey, maybe Dale, Bobby and I
should go get some more wood.

09:17.059 --> 09:18.458
Joseph, you stay here.

09:18.494 --> 09:21.429
The only thing keeping you safe
from bears is this fire,

09:21.463 --> 09:24.557
so don't fall asleep
and let it go out.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.067
Whatever.

09:26.101 --> 09:27.659
DALE:
I don’t want
to walk anymore!

09:27.703 --> 09:30.228
How come he
gets to stay?

09:30.272 --> 09:31.762
(wheezing)

09:31.807 --> 09:33.331
There's wood.

09:33.375 --> 09:37.937
We're passing all kinds of wood.

09:37.980 --> 09:42.576
Wood, wood, wood, wood,
wood, wood.

09:42.618 --> 09:43.585
Wood.

09:43.619 --> 09:46.417
That's a weird word.

09:46.455 --> 09:47.945
Wood... wood.

09:47.990 --> 09:49.514
Weird... word.

09:49.558 --> 09:51.253
Weird... wood.

09:51.293 --> 09:53.193
Yeah, maybe this
is far enough.

09:53.228 --> 09:55.196
All right, who
wants a candy bar?

09:55.230 --> 09:57.164
Oh, thank God.
I'm starving.

09:57.199 --> 09:58.166
Dale?

09:58.200 --> 09:59.997
Wood... wood, wood.

10:00.035 --> 10:01.935
Wood, wood, wood.

10:01.970 --> 10:02.937
Wood!

10:02.971 --> 10:03.938
Wood.

10:03.972 --> 10:07.703
(Indian flute & tambourine
playing)

10:07.743 --> 10:10.871
Oh, my God, Dale,
are you all right?

10:10.913 --> 10:12.574
I see the buffalo!

10:12.614 --> 10:19.452
I see the Indian!

10:19.488 --> 10:20.750
I... am... the Indian.

10:20.789 --> 10:22.381
Oh, dang it.

10:22.424 --> 10:24.187
Dad, where the hell are you?

10:24.226 --> 10:25.750
Dad?

10:25.794 --> 10:28.763
BOBBY:
Your dad's
not coming.

10:28.797 --> 10:31.527
He's rolling around on
the ground and eating bark,

10:31.567 --> 10:33.660
and my dad's saying
"dang it" a lot.

10:33.702 --> 10:37.297
This trip is so... sucks!

10:37.339 --> 10:39.307
You know what
the land's telling me?

10:39.341 --> 10:40.808
Wreck stuff!

10:40.843 --> 10:42.504
(gasps)

10:42.544 --> 10:44.512
That's your dad's
sleeping bag!

10:44.546 --> 10:45.444
(Joseph laughing)

10:45.481 --> 10:49.850
Look at it burn!

10:53.622 --> 10:57.114
(growls)

10:57.159 --> 10:58.126
Hey, Bobby,

10:58.160 --> 11:00.651
I wanted to talk
to you about Joseph.

11:00.696 --> 11:04.188
If, uh, if Joseph's planning
to do something bad

11:04.233 --> 11:05.200
I want you to tell me.

11:05.234 --> 11:07.134
Wait a second.

11:07.169 --> 11:09.160
You want me to be a narc.

11:09.204 --> 11:10.330
Bobby, sometimes

11:10.372 --> 11:12.272
narcing is good.

11:12.307 --> 11:15.037
You see that?

11:15.077 --> 11:18.672
If Boomhauer hadn't called
me and narced on Bill

11:18.714 --> 11:20.944
I wouldn't have known
he was in trouble.

11:20.983 --> 11:21.950
Relax!

11:21.984 --> 11:22.951
Don't struggle.

11:22.985 --> 11:24.953
You’re just making
things worse.

11:24.987 --> 11:25.954
Don't tell me
what to do.

11:25.988 --> 11:27.455
I'm going to go
out there

11:27.489 --> 11:29.423
and try to pry
that tire off Bill.

11:29.458 --> 11:32.427
I'll probably get kicked
and scratched in the process,

11:32.461 --> 11:33.723
but that’s what
friends do.

11:33.762 --> 11:36.094
(knock at door)

11:36.131 --> 11:39.100
Hello, my beautiful
Indian brother!

11:39.134 --> 11:40.158
Can I come in?

11:40.202 --> 11:42.329
I got a vision
that needs interpreting.

11:42.371 --> 11:43.338
(sighs)

11:43.372 --> 11:44.896
So I've heard.

11:44.940 --> 11:46.999
Please, Dale,
that belonged
to my father.

11:47.042 --> 11:48.703
Yeah, it's nice.

11:48.744 --> 11:50.871
What's that
made out of,
rigatoni?

11:50.913 --> 11:53.006
Bones.
Eww!

11:53.048 --> 11:56.506
Anyway, try running
this vision through
the old noggin.

11:56.552 --> 11:57.917
There was an Indian...

11:57.953 --> 12:00.251
I couldn't see his face,
but he was a big guy,

12:00.289 --> 12:03.452
about yay tall
and yay wide,

12:03.492 --> 12:06.222
wearing a magnificent
buffalo headdress,

12:06.261 --> 12:09.287
and he was making
love to my wife!

12:09.331 --> 12:10.525
Dale, I'm not sure I...

12:10.566 --> 12:11.533
Hold on, there's more.

12:11.567 --> 12:15.094
I suddenly found
myself in a hospital,

12:15.137 --> 12:18.197
watching Nancy give
birth to Joseph,

12:18.240 --> 12:22.540
except Joseph was wearing
the exact same headdress

12:22.578 --> 12:24.136
as the faceless Indian.

12:24.179 --> 12:26.909
So, working backwards...

12:26.949 --> 12:32.148
I fathered an Indian child,
therefore I am an Indian!

12:32.187 --> 12:35.020
Okay, that's one interpretation.

12:35.057 --> 12:37.025
So, do you have
a regular place

12:37.059 --> 12:40.028
you buy your feathers
and bonnets and so forth?

12:40.062 --> 12:41.029
(sighs)

12:41.063 --> 12:42.030
It's a website.

12:42.064 --> 12:43.031
Yep.

12:43.065 --> 12:44.032
Yup.

12:44.066 --> 12:45.033
Mm-hmm.

12:45.067 --> 12:46.432
(war whoop)

12:46.468 --> 12:49.528
Well, I'm just gonna come
right out and say it, Dale.

12:49.571 --> 12:51.630
Something seems different
about you.

12:51.673 --> 12:53.300
Something is different, Bill.

12:53.342 --> 12:55.105
I had a vision.

12:55.143 --> 12:56.201
I'm an Indian now.

12:56.245 --> 12:57.212
Oh.

12:57.246 --> 12:59.373
I always wondered why I hated

12:59.414 --> 13:02.577
the federal government and loved
tobacco with such passions

13:02.618 --> 13:04.245
but now it all makes sense.

13:04.286 --> 13:07.119
Okay, time-out,
Sitting Jackass.

13:07.155 --> 13:09.123
Have you looked
in a mirror lately?

13:09.157 --> 13:11.990
You are the god dang
whitest person
I've ever seen.

13:12.027 --> 13:14.518
I am the albino buffalo!

13:14.563 --> 13:17.964
Deal with it.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.969
Is this your lunch period,
or are you cutting?

13:21.003 --> 13:22.971
'C-'Cause I'm
definitely cutting.

13:23.005 --> 13:24.563
We're cutting
and making plans.

13:24.606 --> 13:25.834
Tomorrow night

13:25.874 --> 13:26.841
we are going to show

13:26.875 --> 13:29.366
those stupid fat-ass pandas
who's boss.

13:29.411 --> 13:30.935
We're gonna paint them!

13:30.979 --> 13:33.846
Yeah, we're gonna paint
our names all over them.

13:33.882 --> 13:35.008
(nervous laugh)

13:35.050 --> 13:37.109
Bu-But those pandas aren't
gonna just sit around

13:37.152 --> 13:38.414
and let you paint them.

13:38.453 --> 13:40.421
That's why we're gonna drug 'em.

13:40.455 --> 13:42.719
We got bamboo
soaking in NyQuil.

13:46.261 --> 13:49.924
Hey, Joseph,
nice skeletons.

13:49.965 --> 13:51.762
Knife through
the eye, huh?

13:51.800 --> 13:54.030
That's probably
what killed him.

13:54.069 --> 13:56.867
If you're gonna
give me a hard time,
do it fast, Bobby,

13:56.905 --> 13:58.873
'cause I'm getting
out of here.

13:58.907 --> 13:59.874
You're cutting again?

13:59.908 --> 14:02.536
You keep it up,
you're gonna get expelled!

14:02.577 --> 14:04.875
So? Steve's older brother
got expelled.

14:04.913 --> 14:07.211
Now he's got his own business
filling vending machines.

14:07.249 --> 14:08.876
Gets all the snacks he wants.

14:08.917 --> 14:12.876
Hey, how about we go do
something really bad

14:12.921 --> 14:14.149
after school together?

14:14.189 --> 14:19.388
We could buy a pane of glass
and break it. My treat!

14:19.428 --> 14:20.759
Wow. You'd do that for me?

14:20.796 --> 14:25.665
My dad's got a new edger
we can use.

14:25.701 --> 14:28.295
You know, Bobby, I haven't
been able to eat all day,

14:28.337 --> 14:30.237
and I can't sleep.

14:30.272 --> 14:31.603
Can I tell you something?

14:31.640 --> 14:33.039
What's up?

14:33.075 --> 14:34.042
(sighs)

14:34.076 --> 14:35.043
Steve and those guys

14:35.077 --> 14:37.045
are planning this big thing
at the zoo tonight.

14:37.079 --> 14:38.046
What?

14:38.080 --> 14:39.172
I shouldn't have said anything.

14:39.214 --> 14:40.579
You can’t tell anyone!

14:40.615 --> 14:44.142
Everybody, I'd like you to
welcome a special guest today.

14:44.186 --> 14:47.349
A man from our local
Native American community

14:47.389 --> 14:49.789
who took time out
of his busy schedule

14:49.825 --> 14:53.921
to share a little something
about his heritage.

14:53.962 --> 14:55.691
Good morning, class!

14:55.731 --> 14:59.258
Or, as my people say, "How!"

14:59.301 --> 15:01.030
I can see your Dad’s junk.

15:01.069 --> 15:06.166
(low mumbling sounds)

15:06.208 --> 15:12.545
(Indian flute music plays)

15:12.581 --> 15:13.639
Dad! Dad!!

15:13.682 --> 15:15.513
Everything all right, son?

15:15.550 --> 15:18.542
I was just doing some farming
and I thought I heard something.

15:18.587 --> 15:19.554
You're not crazy!

15:19.588 --> 15:22.819
I just had one of those vision
things you were talking about!

15:22.858 --> 15:25.019
Maybe I should go talk to
Mr. Redcorn like you did,

15:25.060 --> 15:26.322
find out what it means.

15:26.361 --> 15:28.158
You don't need John Redcorn.

15:28.196 --> 15:31.495
As an Indian, I'm fully
qualified to interpret dreams.

15:31.533 --> 15:32.500
Really?

15:32.534 --> 15:33.796
Is the wind sacred?

15:33.835 --> 15:34.802
Well...

15:34.836 --> 15:39.705
I was running
with a herd of buffalo.

15:39.741 --> 15:41.800
But I didn't run fast enough,
so I got trampled.

15:41.843 --> 15:45.779
And one of those Pandas
was staring at me.

15:45.814 --> 15:47.304
DALE:
That's pretty weird.

15:47.349 --> 15:49.840
Well, I guess the panda
kind of makes sense.

15:49.885 --> 15:52.615
Those guys, you know,
my new friends?

15:52.654 --> 15:55.020
They were gonna do something
real bad at the zoo tonight.

15:55.057 --> 15:56.888
I know what
the dream means.

15:56.925 --> 16:00.656
The dream means:
Go with the herd!

16:00.695 --> 16:02.287
Those kids are your destiny...

16:02.330 --> 16:04.890
they could be your one shot
at coolness!

16:04.933 --> 16:07.265
So I should try to do
what they’re doing

16:07.302 --> 16:08.633
even if I think it's bad?

16:08.670 --> 16:11.434
Yes. Yes!

16:11.473 --> 16:14.271
No. No, you're not gonna
just run with the herd.

16:14.309 --> 16:16.277
The dream means
you've got to run faster

16:16.311 --> 16:17.539
and be even cooler than them.

16:17.579 --> 16:19.843
But they're gonna paint
their names on the pandas!

16:19.881 --> 16:21.849
I could never be
cooler than them.

16:21.883 --> 16:23.851
'Course you could...
by killing a panda!

16:23.885 --> 16:28.151
Yeah, but... isn't killing 'em
like a crime?

16:28.190 --> 16:32.092
Absolutely,
for a white man,
but we’re Indians.

16:32.127 --> 16:33.958
We can kill just
about anything

16:33.995 --> 16:36.259
so long as we use
all the parts.

16:36.298 --> 16:38.266
Hey, how'd you like
to go to school

16:38.300 --> 16:40.029
wearing a panda head
as a hat?

16:40.068 --> 16:41.797
Yeah, that would be cool.

16:41.837 --> 16:43.532
Come on, get dressed.

16:43.572 --> 16:45.802
We're going to the zoo.

16:54.583 --> 16:56.778
What are you doing, sug?

16:56.818 --> 16:58.410
Oh, I get it.

16:58.453 --> 17:00.080
No time for that, cowgirl.

17:00.122 --> 17:02.613
Joseph had a dream
about getting trampled

17:02.657 --> 17:03.817
by a buffalo herd,

17:03.859 --> 17:05.827
so we're off to do
something spectacular

17:05.861 --> 17:07.829
to make sure
the cool kids like him.

17:07.863 --> 17:10.093
Bail money's in the armoire
just in case. Love you!

17:10.132 --> 17:16.731
No, no, Nancy,
the dream is a warning.

17:16.771 --> 17:19.239
Dale's going to ruin
Joseph's life!

17:19.273 --> 17:22.242
I have relied on others
to raise my son for too long.

17:22.277 --> 17:24.540
No offense, but it ends now.

17:24.579 --> 17:29.539
DALE:
Shoot, the gate's locked.

17:29.584 --> 17:31.711
What was that chant
Redcorn taught me?

17:31.753 --> 17:33.687
The one I used
to open the mustard?

17:33.722 --> 17:34.711
(chanting):
♪ Hai-ya ♪

17:34.756 --> 17:36.986
♪ Grey Poupon, hey-hoi... ♪

17:37.025 --> 17:37.889
Dad, watch out!

17:37.926 --> 17:41.089
The gate is open!

17:41.129 --> 17:44.155
Thank you, gate spirit.

17:46.601 --> 17:48.535
Oh, my God,
they're eloping!

17:48.570 --> 17:49.537
No, sug.

17:49.571 --> 17:51.266
It's about Joseph.

17:51.306 --> 17:52.273
Can we come in?

17:52.307 --> 17:55.435
500 years of oppression

17:55.477 --> 17:58.469
and somehow I find this
the most irritating.

17:58.513 --> 18:02.779
We must find Dale and Joseph
before it's too late.

18:02.817 --> 18:03.784
(sighs)

18:03.818 --> 18:05.718
I think I know
where they went.

18:05.754 --> 18:09.815
Is it narking if I tell Pang-Ni
and you overhear it?

18:09.858 --> 18:10.825
Bingo!

18:10.859 --> 18:13.259
You can't hide
from an Indian tracker.

18:13.295 --> 18:15.820
Let's move.

18:15.864 --> 18:17.559
(groans)

18:17.599 --> 18:19.760
Joseph's never going
to talk to me again.

18:19.801 --> 18:23.259
You made a tough choice,
but you might have
saved your friend.

18:23.305 --> 18:26.138
My people have a saying:
When we ask for strength,

18:26.174 --> 18:28.335
the Great Spirit sends us
difficulties,

18:28.376 --> 18:29.343
which make us strong.

18:29.377 --> 18:30.969
That's pretty cool.

18:31.012 --> 18:32.343
You like that?

18:32.380 --> 18:33.972
Hey, pass it on to Joseph.

18:34.015 --> 18:35.175
You know, if you want.

18:35.217 --> 18:37.344
Either way,
it's no biggie to me.

18:44.292 --> 18:45.350
DALE:
Joseph?

18:45.427 --> 18:46.223
Yeah, Dad.

18:46.394 --> 18:47.622
You are going to be so cool!

18:47.662 --> 18:48.959
I know!

18:48.997 --> 18:52.296
(war whoops)

18:52.334 --> 18:54.768
Cool. Some dumb ass
left the gate open.

18:54.803 --> 18:55.770
(war whoops)

18:55.804 --> 19:00.036
Whoa, Gribble's gonna
shoot a panda!

19:00.075 --> 19:01.975
Man, he kills a panda,

19:02.010 --> 19:04.444
he'll be able to get
any chick he wants.

19:04.479 --> 19:09.507
Joseph, put the bow down!

19:09.551 --> 19:10.779
Please, sug!

19:10.819 --> 19:12.184
Ignore the interlopers!

19:12.220 --> 19:14.120
Focus on the hunt!

19:14.155 --> 19:16.214
All right,
Gribble! Do it!

19:16.258 --> 19:17.885
Kill that panda, man!

19:17.926 --> 19:19.154
Let me get you in frame.

19:19.194 --> 19:20.718
Okay, kill it!

19:20.762 --> 19:24.664
The herd is pleased!

19:34.242 --> 19:35.607
You have to make
a choice, Joseph.

19:36.211 --> 19:39.271
Sometimes, a herd can be
the safest place there is,

19:39.314 --> 19:41.544
but the wrong herd
can trample you.

19:41.583 --> 19:42.709
STEVE:
Kill it, Gribble!

19:42.751 --> 19:43.718
Kill it!

19:43.752 --> 19:44.810
You heard him, kill it!

19:44.853 --> 19:47.447
If I killed a panda at your age,
we'd be living

19:47.489 --> 19:49.047
in the Governor's
mansion!

19:49.090 --> 19:54.494
Wow.
Whoa.

19:54.529 --> 19:55.860
I didn't mean to shoot!

19:55.897 --> 19:56.955
It was an accident!

19:56.998 --> 19:58.363
He won't catch a bullet.

19:58.400 --> 19:59.697
I'm not shooting the panda.

19:59.734 --> 20:03.397
Hmm. Like a lead buffalo,
strong, independent...

20:03.438 --> 20:05.429
that will be your path.

20:05.473 --> 20:06.440
STEVE:
Hey!

20:06.474 --> 20:07.202
Boring!

20:07.242 --> 20:10.439
All right, there isn't gonna
be a panda-killing tonight.

20:10.478 --> 20:15.074
So, get home before
I call the cops!

20:19.654 --> 20:21.144
I thought
he was a cop.

20:21.189 --> 20:25.216
I'm not gonna lie
to you, Joseph.

20:25.260 --> 20:29.663
It sure would have been sweet
having a cool son.

20:29.698 --> 20:33.828
(yelling):
Hey!

20:33.868 --> 20:36.530
Hey, cool kids,
look at Joseph smoke! Look!

20:36.571 --> 20:40.371
Nah, they're gone.

20:40.408 --> 20:42.842
You know, Dad, sometimes
the coolest thing to do is

20:42.877 --> 20:45.141
make your own path
and not kill a panda.

20:45.180 --> 20:50.311
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:50.352 --> 20:53.185
Sorry I narked on you, Joseph.

20:53.221 --> 20:56.088
Yeah, well, sorry
I was such a tool.

20:56.124 --> 20:57.523
(awning)

20:57.559 --> 20:58.753
(awns)

20:58.793 --> 21:02.422
Dang, I hardly slept
at all last night.

21:02.464 --> 21:05.092
Then I had so much trouble
getting going this morning,

21:05.133 --> 21:07.124
I missed breakfast and the bus.

21:12.173 --> 21:15.802
CONTESTANT:
I'm gonna go with Bobby Panda
for the win, Tom.

21:16.077 --> 21:18.272
TOM BERGERON:
Bobby Panda:
A recent survey found

21:18.313 --> 21:22.807
that the most popular thing
Americans like to dip in fondue

21:22.851 --> 21:26.150
is... what?

21:26.187 --> 21:27.984
My mother-in-law!

21:28.022 --> 21:29.683
(laughter)

21:29.724 --> 21:31.715
