01:12.455 --> 01:14.594
Come on, get that sun lamp ready.

01:14.695 --> 01:17.280
About 15 minutes is the most l'd advise,
Mr. Warriner.

01:17.383 --> 01:21.606
Fifteen minutes nothing! l need
a deep Florida tan if it takes all afternoon.

01:21.703 --> 01:23.078
Give her the gun.

01:23.176 --> 01:26.339
All aboard for Miami,
Palm Beach and Point South.

01:26.408 --> 01:28.513
-Hi, Jerry.
-Hello, Frank.

01:28.615 --> 01:30.273
-How goes it?
-Fine!

01:30.375 --> 01:32.764
-Like to play a little squash?
-No, thanks.

01:32.839 --> 01:36.417
You're awfully white-skinned
for a guy who spent two weeks in Florida.

01:36.487 --> 01:39.618
-That's what l thought.
-What did you do there, carry a parasol?

01:39.687 --> 01:43.332
-Or didn't you go?
-Don't go spreading that around, Frank.

01:44.103 --> 01:46.786
Pulling a fast one on the little wife?

01:46.855 --> 01:50.784
Frank, l'm surprised at you.
l'm supposed to have been in Florida.

01:50.855 --> 01:53.190
Supposing one of Lucy's friends
says to her:

01:53.255 --> 01:56.005
''Well, why isn't he tanned?''
Lucy will be embarrassed.

01:56.103 --> 01:58.405
l'll be tanned,
and Lucy won't be embarrassed.

01:58.503 --> 02:02.464
What wives don't know won't hurt them.
What you don't know won't hurt you.

02:02.536 --> 02:05.318
l don't want to know.
How about coming by the house?

02:05.383 --> 02:07.652
Some friends are coming by
for a late breakfast.

02:07.751 --> 02:11.428
l got a better idea. Come to my place
for eggnogs and breakfast...

02:11.495 --> 02:14.462
and maybe later we can duck the women
and play some golf.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.772
-Swell, boy, you got me convinced.
-Okay.

02:16.871 --> 02:18.595
-See you later, Jerry.
-So long, Frank.

02:19.975 --> 02:21.382
Come on in!

02:21.703 --> 02:23.012
Hey, Lucy!

02:25.031 --> 02:26.591
That man is here.

02:26.663 --> 02:28.551
Maybe she wasn't expecting you.

02:28.615 --> 02:31.844
No, she's around somewhere.
Put your things down anywhere.

02:32.103 --> 02:34.721
-Hello, Celeste.
-Hello, Mr. Warriner, you look well.

02:34.791 --> 02:37.213
Thank you, Celeste, and vice versa.

02:37.511 --> 02:40.806
Where's Mrs. Warriner? Look what l got her
all the way from Florida.

02:40.871 --> 02:42.759
-She's out.
-She's out?

02:44.391 --> 02:47.686
Never mind. Go get some eggnogs,
and we'll find something to drink to.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.540
Come on, gang, enter.

02:52.967 --> 02:55.552
Mr. Smith, look who's here.

02:57.991 --> 02:59.420
Come on, boy.

03:00.647 --> 03:01.988
Where's Mamma?

03:02.087 --> 03:04.509
Look, l've got something for you.

03:05.607 --> 03:07.232
Come on, get it.

03:12.135 --> 03:14.306
What are you doing, reading my mail?

03:14.407 --> 03:17.887
Several letters there for your wife.
Yesterday's, too.

03:20.967 --> 03:23.684
l hope Lucy comes back
looking as well as you do.

03:23.784 --> 03:28.573
She's probably up at her Aunt Patsy's.
She always goes there when she's lonely.

03:30.023 --> 03:32.292
Thank you, Celeste, l'll take it up from here.

03:32.359 --> 03:33.766
-Jerry.
-What?

03:33.863 --> 03:36.285
Supposing Aunt Patsy wasn't home?

03:36.359 --> 03:39.359
l get it. l'm up to my neck in funny people!

03:39.495 --> 03:44.132
Seriously, l wish Lucy would go out and
get some fun now and again. Do her good.

03:44.295 --> 03:48.932
That's the trouble with marriages today.
People are always imagining things.

03:49.095 --> 03:52.063
The road to Reno is paved with suspicions.

03:52.135 --> 03:54.556
First thing you know,
they're in a divorce court.

03:54.663 --> 03:57.510
The broad-minded man from the Rio Grande!

03:57.575 --> 04:01.601
lf you think l'll get a chance to prove my
broad-mindedness any minute, you're crazy.

04:01.703 --> 04:04.638
Lucy's up at her Aunt Patsy's cabin.
l'll bet on it.

04:04.743 --> 04:08.158
lncidentally, what a swell spot that is.
Good fishing....

04:08.263 --> 04:12.060
Sometimes, on a clear day across that lake,
you can see for....

04:19.142 --> 04:23.169
Mrs. Barnsley, Miss Heath,
Mr. Barnsley, Mr. Randall.

04:27.175 --> 04:28.549
Aunt Patsy.

04:30.759 --> 04:34.436
Any idea where Lucy is?
You know, she invited me to this--

04:38.023 --> 04:40.870
-Darling!
-Hello, dear!

04:40.967 --> 04:43.934
How grand and brown you are!
Hello, Patsy, dear.

04:44.039 --> 04:47.388
-Did you miss me? Been thinking about me?
-Look what l brought you!

04:47.463 --> 04:50.397
All the way from Florida? Bless your heart!

04:53.671 --> 04:55.941
You know Armand Duvalle, dear.

04:57.063 --> 04:58.819
Come on in, Armand.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.371
Mr. Duvalle, this is my aunt, Miss Adams.

05:02.439 --> 05:05.025
Mr. and Mrs. Barnsley,
Miss Heath and Mr. Randall.

05:05.127 --> 05:07.015
We've had the most terrible time.

05:07.079 --> 05:09.730
Armand's car broke down last night
miles from nowhere...

05:09.799 --> 05:13.923
and we had to stay at the nastiest inn ever.
No modern conveniences. lt was dreadful!

05:13.991 --> 05:17.787
We were coming home from the junior prom.
Armand's pupil invited us.

05:17.895 --> 05:21.670
Oh, it's a long story, but l must....
Hello, there!

05:21.959 --> 05:25.276
Your wife, she was the loveliest woman
in the party.

05:25.383 --> 05:27.838
Armand, you always say the nicest things.

05:27.943 --> 05:29.731
lsn't that cute? Did you bring him that?

05:29.799 --> 05:31.622
-Yes--
-Go catch it!

05:32.807 --> 05:37.793
-Were you disappointed l wasn't here?
-Not at all. After all, you didn't expect me.

05:38.023 --> 05:41.601
And you'll forgive me
for my car's imperfect performance?

05:41.895 --> 05:45.604
Of course.
l'm sorry the inn was so inconvenient.

05:46.183 --> 05:48.801
That's the only thing that bothers me.

05:49.159 --> 05:52.606
You know, your husband
is not like the average American man.

05:52.711 --> 05:55.493
He's free of all mean suspicion.

05:55.655 --> 05:58.884
He has more the Continental mind. Yes?

05:58.983 --> 06:02.529
That's right, l have a Continental mind.
Will you have an eggnog?

06:02.631 --> 06:03.940
Thank you.

06:09.255 --> 06:13.030
l don't know what kind of a mind Jerry's got,
Continental or cockeyed...

06:13.095 --> 06:16.259
but he's a wonder.
Now, if l stayed out all night...

06:16.359 --> 06:20.069
and waltzed in with handsome Mr. Duvalle,
and said the car broke down....

06:20.135 --> 06:23.233
lt did. Why should Jerry be angry?
l didn't build the car.

06:23.303 --> 06:26.337
-You're perfectly right, dear.
-Of course l am.

06:26.439 --> 06:29.505
Can't have a happy married life
if you're always suspicious.

06:29.575 --> 06:30.981
Right again.

06:31.239 --> 06:33.214
-A little nutmeg?
-Please.

06:33.831 --> 06:37.693
-Why am l boring you with private matters?
-We're not bored.

06:37.799 --> 06:41.280
No one's interested in my adventure
but Jerry, who knows it's innocent...

06:41.351 --> 06:45.311
just as well as he knows
that he just got back from Florida.

06:46.983 --> 06:48.805
l see what you mean.

06:50.407 --> 06:53.124
More drinks, everybody? There's lots left.

06:53.191 --> 06:57.381
-No, thank you, l think we better be going.
-You don't all have to go, do you?

06:57.671 --> 06:59.394
Go? No.

07:01.127 --> 07:04.356
-Well, it's silly to go so soon.
-We must go, really.

07:04.423 --> 07:08.068
Patsy, dear, where are you going?
l haven't even had a chance to talk to you.

07:08.167 --> 07:10.306
l'll see you later, my dear.

07:10.407 --> 07:13.090
l always say four's a crowd.

07:14.599 --> 07:17.086
There's something in what she says.

07:22.599 --> 07:23.908
Thank you.

07:25.511 --> 07:28.827
-Say, are you hungry?
-To tell you the truth, l'm starved.

07:28.935 --> 07:31.204
Why don't you go out and grab a bite?

07:31.303 --> 07:36.038
-A strong fellow should take care of himself.
-Why, what have l done?

07:36.263 --> 07:39.078
-lf you speak of last night, l assure you--
-You don't believe--

07:39.175 --> 07:40.997
We'll discuss it in private.

07:41.095 --> 07:44.892
That is if Mr. Duvalle can remember
where we keep our door.

07:44.967 --> 07:48.763
ln all fairness, you should permit me
to remain and explain ourselves.

07:48.839 --> 07:51.228
American women
aren't accustomed to gallantry.

07:51.335 --> 07:53.953
l appreciate your offer,
but maybe you'd better go.

07:54.054 --> 07:56.389
Pardon me, Mrs. Warriner,
you misunderstand.

07:56.455 --> 07:58.789
l am a voice teacher, am l not?

07:58.854 --> 08:03.840
For one year she has been my pupil.
And from time to time, l pat her on the back.

08:03.943 --> 08:07.009
l mean, l congratulate her on her...

08:07.623 --> 08:09.346
-development.
-ls that so?

08:09.414 --> 08:12.000
-Do l express myself?
-You've been doing all right.

08:12.231 --> 08:16.541
But now my position must be considered.
l have never yet been in a scandal.

08:16.615 --> 08:18.557
-Never been caught?
-No.

08:19.303 --> 08:22.118
l am a great teacher, not a great lover.

08:22.215 --> 08:26.176
That's right, Armand, no one could ever
accuse you of being a great lover.

08:26.279 --> 08:29.956
That is, l mean to say,
who's to say whether you are or not?

08:30.023 --> 08:33.057
lt's all so silly!
But maybe you had better go.

08:34.119 --> 08:38.375
-l really don't know what to say.
-lf you go, you won't have to say anything.

08:38.470 --> 08:42.015
-Perhaps it is best this way, Mrs. Warriner.
-l think so.

08:43.270 --> 08:45.343
-l will see you soon?
-Yes.

08:45.447 --> 08:47.519
lt has been all so perfect.

08:48.166 --> 08:50.141
Thank you for everything.

08:50.247 --> 08:51.675
Take another bow.

08:51.751 --> 08:54.566
Not a bad performance
considering no rehearsals or anything.

08:54.631 --> 08:57.948
Why, Mr. Warriner,
you're out of your Continental mind.

09:02.726 --> 09:06.338
That was funny, what he said
about your Continental mind.

09:06.887 --> 09:11.043
-No doubt he has a better sense of humor.
-No, l beg to differ.

09:11.110 --> 09:13.314
Right now you're twice as funny as him.

09:13.447 --> 09:15.170
-Quit stalling, Lucy.
-l'm not--

09:15.239 --> 09:17.149
Perhaps our marriage means nothing to you.

09:17.255 --> 09:20.768
Perhaps you have no sentiment left for me.
Look at this.

09:23.047 --> 09:26.909
Look, a letter l wrote you.
Did you care when you read it? No!

09:27.655 --> 09:30.143
You knew there'd be a letter
every morning...

09:30.247 --> 09:33.476
but you were far too busy
with Armand Duvalle to give it a thought.

09:33.575 --> 09:35.811
lt's enough to destroy one's faith, isn't it?

09:36.807 --> 09:39.295
l haven't any faith left in anyone.

09:39.527 --> 09:41.567
l know just how you feel.

09:42.279 --> 09:43.937
What do you mean?

09:51.782 --> 09:55.939
You didn't mention in any of your letters
the terrible rainy spell in Florida.

09:56.007 --> 09:58.112
The papers were full of it.

09:59.655 --> 10:02.655
-l can explain that, Lucy.
-You can?

10:02.727 --> 10:06.982
Don't try to change the subject.
You think a great offense is a great defense.

10:07.046 --> 10:10.178
Don't try to justify your behavior
by insinuating things about me.

10:10.247 --> 10:13.116
l haven't any behavior to justify.
l've just been unlucky.

10:13.351 --> 10:17.574
You caught me in a truth, and it seems
there's nothing less logical than the truth.

10:17.671 --> 10:19.907
-A philosopher?
-You don't believe me.

10:19.974 --> 10:22.146
How can l believe you?
''The car broke down.''

10:22.215 --> 10:24.418
People stopped believing that ages ago.

10:24.551 --> 10:26.853
-His car's very old.
-So is his story.

10:26.950 --> 10:29.536
-Let me tell you something.
-Let me tell you something.

10:29.639 --> 10:32.094
l told you the truth about all this, Jerry.

10:32.199 --> 10:35.101
Don't you see?
There can't be any doubt in marriage.

10:35.175 --> 10:39.299
The whole thing's built on faith.
lf you've lost that, you've lost everything.

10:39.399 --> 10:41.733
When that's gone
the marriage is washed up.

10:41.831 --> 10:43.456
-Do you mean that?
-Yes.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.664
-Then that settles it.
-l guess it does.

10:45.735 --> 10:48.899
l wouldn't go on living with you
if you were dipped in platinum.

10:48.999 --> 10:50.908
So divorce me. lt'll be a pleasure.

10:50.983 --> 10:55.587
You think l'd drag that music lover to court
to show people the man you preferred?

10:55.687 --> 10:58.949
Then l'll divorce you.
lt's customary for the wife to bring suit.

10:59.079 --> 11:01.981
lt has something to do
with the husband being a gentleman.

11:02.118 --> 11:04.868
Just get on with the divorce proceedings.
l can't wait.

11:04.967 --> 11:07.617
-l'll call our lawyer right now.
-All right, here.

11:08.007 --> 11:12.000
You don't mind? l don't know anyone else.
You get around much more than l do.

11:12.070 --> 11:13.477
ls that so?

11:20.775 --> 11:21.952
Hello?

11:22.471 --> 11:23.900
Hello, Lucy.

11:24.615 --> 11:25.989
What's that?

11:26.087 --> 11:28.356
Divorce? You and Jerry?

11:30.118 --> 11:33.152
Don't do anything in haste
you might regret later.

11:33.255 --> 11:37.149
-Marriage is a beautiful thing, and you--
-Can't she call back after we've eaten?

11:37.255 --> 11:39.262
Please be quiet, will you?

11:40.326 --> 11:43.326
You seem agitated, Lucy.
Try and calm yourself.

11:43.398 --> 11:46.976
l'd hate to see you take any hasty action
in a matter like this.

11:47.046 --> 11:49.796
-Marriage is a beautiful thing, and you--
-Finish your meal.

11:49.895 --> 11:53.539
-Why can't they call you back later?
-Will you shut your mouth?

11:53.927 --> 11:56.927
As l was saying, Lucy,
marriage is a beautiful thing.

11:56.998 --> 12:00.294
When you've been married as long as l,
you'll appreciate it, too.

12:00.359 --> 12:03.675
Your food's getting ice-cold.
You always complain about your food.

12:03.783 --> 12:06.881
Just shut your big mouth.
l'll eat when l'm good and ready.

12:06.983 --> 12:10.693
lf you don't like it,
you know what you can do. So shut up!

12:12.423 --> 12:14.397
Marriage is a beautiful thing.

12:21.063 --> 12:25.285
You see? Because you were a naughty dog,
they made you leave the room. Come on.

12:25.863 --> 12:28.797
ln the case of Warriner v. Warriner,
the court grants...

12:28.903 --> 12:32.351
an interlocutory decree of divorce
in favor of the plaintiff, Lucy Warriner.

12:32.423 --> 12:36.219
The divorce, without further contesting,
will become final 90 days from this day.

12:36.294 --> 12:40.669
Plaintiff and defendant then have the liberty
to make other marriages, if they so desire.

12:40.742 --> 12:43.776
Your Honor, there's a matter still unsettled.

12:44.294 --> 12:47.710
-The matter about....
-Mr. Smith.

12:47.782 --> 12:50.597
-Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Smith.
-Who is Mr. Smith?

12:50.662 --> 12:53.958
-Mr. Smith is their dog.
-No, Mr. Smith is my dog.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.259
-ls that so?
-Silence!

12:56.358 --> 12:59.075
But, you see, Mr. Smith belongs to me,
and she has him.

12:59.142 --> 13:00.866
Very well, go ahead.

13:00.966 --> 13:03.138
The animal is in Mrs. Warriner's possession.

13:03.238 --> 13:06.784
You ordered him from the courtroom
at the beginning, for contempt.

13:06.887 --> 13:10.781
-Mr. Warriner wishes to have him because....
-Because he's mine!

13:10.887 --> 13:12.796
-He is not.
-He is, too.

13:12.903 --> 13:14.757
-He is not.
-Silence!

13:16.230 --> 13:17.441
ls not.

13:19.079 --> 13:22.112
Mrs. Warriner, step up and tell me
why you regard the dog...

13:22.215 --> 13:26.044
as your personal property, so the court
may decide if he should remain with you.

13:26.118 --> 13:28.322
Nothing would please me more.

13:29.158 --> 13:31.362
Your Honor, l saw Mr. Smith first.

13:31.430 --> 13:34.430
lt was in that pet shop on Madison Avenue.
You know it?

13:34.535 --> 13:38.790
-You don't? lt's between 47th and....
-lt's frightfully immaterial.

13:39.847 --> 13:43.196
Well, you ought to know.
l decided to buy Mr. Smith...

13:43.271 --> 13:47.777
but l turned away for a moment
to look at a Persian kitten. Do you like cats?

13:47.846 --> 13:52.451
l don't either. So l turned around again,
and this man had Mr. Smith in his arms.

13:52.519 --> 13:57.058
l said, ''Pardon me, l'm buying this puppy.''
And then he just smiled at me.

13:57.127 --> 14:00.160
Then somehow, suddenly,
the three of us were having lunch...

14:00.263 --> 14:03.940
the man, and Mr. Smith, and l.
And then things happened swiftly...

14:04.006 --> 14:06.373
so l said, ''We'd better get married,''
and we did.

14:06.438 --> 14:10.050
That way we could give Mr. Smith
a better home and live happily ever after.

14:10.151 --> 14:12.125
-Until now.
-l see.

14:12.806 --> 14:14.879
ln these custody cases, Mrs. Warriner...

14:14.982 --> 14:18.528
we often allow the final decision
to rest with the party in question.

14:18.630 --> 14:20.321
You mean Mr. Smith?

14:20.902 --> 14:22.528
Send for the dog.

14:24.295 --> 14:27.458
Custody of the dog
will depend on his own desire.

14:28.966 --> 14:32.795
-Mr. Warriner, will you step up here, please?
-Yes, Your Honor.

14:39.655 --> 14:41.083
Unfasten him.

14:45.319 --> 14:47.326
You may each call the dog.

14:47.591 --> 14:50.624
-Mr. Smith, come on, boy.
-Smitty, look up here.

14:57.095 --> 14:59.550
Don't pay attention. Come on, boy.

14:59.623 --> 15:02.470
Look up here. You know me.

15:06.566 --> 15:09.348
-Smitty, look up here.
-No, don't!

15:13.319 --> 15:14.496
l win.

15:14.727 --> 15:17.509
Custody of the dog
is awarded to Mrs. Warriner.

15:17.607 --> 15:21.284
Your Honor, that's not quite fair.
l ought to see the dog twice a month or so.

15:21.351 --> 15:23.074
-l'll take it under advisement.
-Goodbye.

15:23.142 --> 15:25.182
Thank you. Goodbye.

15:26.470 --> 15:28.226
Goodbye, Your Honor.

15:28.806 --> 15:32.548
-You won't forget to do that, Judge?
-l'll take it under advisement.

15:32.646 --> 15:34.621
Yes, but when will you know?

15:41.607 --> 15:43.908
Look at that rain!

15:44.006 --> 15:47.836
-Why, is it doing anything besides falling?
-l don't think so.

15:48.006 --> 15:50.756
Nothing unusual ever happens around here.

15:51.174 --> 15:54.021
Patsy, l'm sorry you're so bored tonight.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.934
Why tonight? l've been bored for a month.

15:57.127 --> 16:01.469
lf l'd known we'd be buried side by side
l'd never have taken this apartment.

16:01.575 --> 16:05.699
l wouldn't have asked you to come
and live with me if l'd known that...

16:05.767 --> 16:09.476
a sort of readjustment
takes place after divorce.

16:09.959 --> 16:14.115
Readjustment my foot!
That's just another word for moping around.

16:14.247 --> 16:17.596
Don't be silly.
Anyhow, where can two women go alone?

16:17.702 --> 16:21.597
You know dozens of men
who'd turn handsprings to take you out.

16:21.702 --> 16:25.696
l've got you all dressed up, ready to go out,
and you weaken and refuse.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.523
You're just an old grouch.

16:27.622 --> 16:30.557
l want to go where there's life.
And l don't mean plant life.

16:30.662 --> 16:32.386
l want to go to the theater.

16:32.454 --> 16:35.421
You know, go places later
and step around and do things.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.396
-But you can't go in all this rain.
-Why not, no taxis?

16:38.694 --> 16:40.036
No escort.

16:40.231 --> 16:43.809
Unless there's a new ruling,
l don't need an escort to get a drink.

16:43.911 --> 16:46.278
l'm going down to the bar and see Joe.

16:46.343 --> 16:49.212
Bartender or no bartender, he's still a man.

16:49.319 --> 16:52.068
-Maybe he knocks off early.
-Patsy, you wouldn't!

16:52.134 --> 16:54.982
l wouldn't?
You're talking to a desperate woman.

16:55.270 --> 16:57.572
Hello, Smitty, come on up, boy.

16:58.278 --> 17:01.627
-lsn't he cute?
-Too bad he can't wear a top hat.

17:04.262 --> 17:06.335
Did you hear what she said?

17:40.070 --> 17:44.227
-l wonder if you'd do me a favor?
-Well, of course, that all depends.

18:01.479 --> 18:05.254
lmagine you living right across the hall
from us all of this time.

18:05.319 --> 18:08.635
l think it's just wonderful
that we've met this way.

18:16.583 --> 18:18.852
Lucy, may l present Mr. Leeson?

18:18.918 --> 18:22.530
This is my niece you wanted to meet.
Her name is Lucy Warriner.

18:22.630 --> 18:24.605
How do you do?

18:24.711 --> 18:26.849
-Won't you sit down?
-Thanks.

18:27.910 --> 18:31.587
Mr. Leeson's just from Oklahoma, Lucy.
He's a stranger in town.

18:31.654 --> 18:35.996
He'd take it as real neighborly of us
if we show him some of the bright spots.

18:36.454 --> 18:37.916
He would?

18:38.502 --> 18:40.739
lt's raining awfully hard. l don't think--

18:40.806 --> 18:45.149
That's just exactly what l said,
''l don't think the rain will stop us.''

18:45.222 --> 18:48.289
Besides, l think it'll let up in a few minutes,
Miss Warriner.

18:48.390 --> 18:51.968
Mr. Leeson's a neighbor.
He lives across the hall with his mother.

18:52.070 --> 18:54.590
-That's what you said, right?
-Yes, with my mother.

18:54.662 --> 18:56.931
We're here on a visit. l'm in oil, you know.

18:57.030 --> 18:58.754
Marinated, so to speak.

19:00.230 --> 19:05.184
Say, that's a good one!
l got to remember to tell that to my mother.

19:05.414 --> 19:08.763
Mr. Leeson, won't you tell us
something about Oklahoma?

19:09.735 --> 19:11.742
Oklahoma's pretty swell.

19:12.198 --> 19:16.803
l got quite a ranch down there.
Like you to see it sometime, Miss Warriner.

19:16.870 --> 19:19.521
l don't get out there very....

19:20.166 --> 19:24.356
l got cattle and horses
and chickens and alfalfa and--

19:30.438 --> 19:32.991
-Hello, Jerry.
-Patsy, how are things?

19:33.062 --> 19:36.128
-We weren't expecting you.
-Why, what goes on?

19:40.198 --> 19:43.046
Hiya, fellow! Mr. Smith, how have you been?

19:43.110 --> 19:45.477
l'll see you in a minute, boy. Yeah, sure.

19:45.574 --> 19:47.876
-Hello, Jerry.
-Hello, Lucy.

19:47.974 --> 19:49.797
What might you be doing here?

19:49.894 --> 19:52.611
Have you forgotten
this is my day to visit Mr. Smith?

19:52.678 --> 19:54.621
lt says so right there.

19:58.951 --> 20:01.918
l'm so sorry.
Mr. Leeson, this is my husband.

20:04.518 --> 20:07.682
He's only my husband for,
how much longer is it now, 60 days?

20:07.782 --> 20:10.816
-Fifty-nine.
-That's better, only 59 days.

20:10.918 --> 20:14.267
And don't worry about him,
he has a Continental mind.

20:17.094 --> 20:20.160
-Excuse me, what did you say?
-l'm glad to know you.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.018
How can you be glad to know me?

20:22.086 --> 20:25.403
l know how l'd feel if l was with a girl
and her husband walked in.

20:25.510 --> 20:27.103
l'll bet you do.

20:27.302 --> 20:31.131
l don't think you ought to go around
telling people you're not married.

20:31.206 --> 20:33.573
He looks a nice fellow.
How do you think he feels?

20:33.670 --> 20:38.372
-Why don't you go play with the dog?
-You go on with whatever you were doing.

20:38.470 --> 20:39.931
Don't mind me.

20:45.190 --> 20:48.256
Any new dogs in the neighborhood?
Been chasing any cats?

20:48.326 --> 20:50.181
Sit down, Mr. Leeson.

20:50.278 --> 20:53.180
-Tell me some more about Arizona.
-Oklahoma.

20:53.382 --> 20:56.349
l mean Oklahoma. That's me for you!

20:58.854 --> 21:01.472
ls he getting enough to eat lately?
He doesn't look well.

21:01.542 --> 21:03.811
You don't look so hot yourself.

21:07.270 --> 21:11.296
l don't think he's getting enough exercise.
He's got circles under his eyes.

21:18.470 --> 21:20.707
-The court ruled--
-What about a tune, boy?

21:20.806 --> 21:23.588
Yes. You see,
there's nothing we can do about it.

21:24.422 --> 21:27.204
Don't worry about it, Mr. Leeson.
Go right ahead.

21:34.310 --> 21:36.481
-My main business is oil.
-Oil?

21:41.094 --> 21:42.304
Sing it!

21:45.958 --> 21:47.900
l do pretty well.

21:48.934 --> 21:51.552
l have a ranch. My hobby is horses.

21:52.454 --> 21:53.664
Hobby horses!

22:03.590 --> 22:05.892
Come on, let's get out of here.

22:12.262 --> 22:15.295
-Goodbye, Jerry.
-Goodbye, Warriner.

22:27.878 --> 22:29.569
What's the matter?

22:29.766 --> 22:33.115
-Are you sure you don't like that fellow?
-Like him!

22:33.222 --> 22:36.735
-You saw how l treated him, didn't you?
-That's what l mean.

22:36.806 --> 22:40.799
On my ranch l got a little red rooster
and a little brown hen...

22:40.902 --> 22:43.171
and they fight all the time, too.

22:43.270 --> 22:47.460
But once in a while, they make up again,
and they're right friendly.

22:53.670 --> 22:57.315
-'Morning, Ma.
-Well? lt was daylight when you came in.

22:57.382 --> 22:59.291
l had a wonderful time. l met a girl--

22:59.398 --> 23:02.180
That's what l thought.
You keep your mind off women.

23:02.278 --> 23:03.423
l can't, Ma.

23:03.494 --> 23:06.145
You can't?
That's what your father always said.

23:06.822 --> 23:10.051
Of course l like Dan Leeson. Why not?
He's sweet and thoughtful.

23:10.150 --> 23:13.379
You should be the last one to object,
you introduced him to me.

23:13.478 --> 23:17.373
He was a man who could take us out.
l didn't expect you to get silly about him.

23:17.478 --> 23:20.674
There's nothing wrong in liking a man
who's sane and considerate.

23:20.742 --> 23:23.393
l was married to one
who was insane and inconsiderate.

23:23.462 --> 23:25.317
Your toast is burning.

23:25.990 --> 23:27.845
-What's her name?
-Lucy Warriner.

23:27.910 --> 23:29.437
Probably an alias.

23:29.510 --> 23:32.193
You'll laugh for talking that way
when you meet Lucy.

23:32.262 --> 23:35.939
She won't want to meet me. She knows
any woman could see through her.

23:36.038 --> 23:38.656
Don't talk that way about Lucy.
l'm crazy about her.

23:39.045 --> 23:42.079
l believe she kind of likes me, too.
l think l'm in love.

23:42.150 --> 23:43.677
Do you know what rebound is?

23:43.750 --> 23:48.027
Trying to get over one love
by bouncing into love with somebody else.

23:48.198 --> 23:52.027
lt's fine, except the rebound is rarely
the real thing. ln fact, it's the bunk.

23:52.133 --> 23:55.265
There's the first bounce, the second, and....
Well, look at me.

23:55.365 --> 23:57.635
You wind up like an old tennis ball.

23:57.734 --> 24:01.030
l'm serious about Dan Leeson.
l like him very much.

24:01.158 --> 24:03.263
l'm all through with Jerry,
he means nothing.

24:03.366 --> 24:05.951
l don't love him, and l probably never did.

24:06.054 --> 24:10.364
l'm sure l never loved him. Now l hate him.
That surprises you, doesn't it?

24:10.438 --> 24:12.925
l hate Jerry Warriner
and l like Dan Leeson very much.

24:12.998 --> 24:16.195
l hope he's crazy about me,
because he's the finest man l've met.

24:16.294 --> 24:18.432
l know, my toast is burning.

24:27.622 --> 24:32.161
You're awful sweet and all that,
but your mind's always on something else.

24:32.486 --> 24:35.169
Or maybe someone else. ls it, sugar pie?

24:35.270 --> 24:37.343
No, l'm in love with love.

24:38.469 --> 24:42.015
''ln the spring,
a young man's fancy lightly turns to''...

24:42.822 --> 24:45.604
what he's been thinking about all winter.

24:45.926 --> 24:48.195
How long have you talked
like Amos and Andy?

24:48.262 --> 24:49.823
For quite some time.

24:49.926 --> 24:52.708
l got wise to the fact
that it helps me in my work.

24:52.806 --> 24:57.313
So, as long as l work,
you'll have to pardon my Southern accent.

24:59.174 --> 25:02.819
Well, shut my mouth,
who's that gorgeous-looking creature?

25:08.710 --> 25:11.612
Have you heard that gag
that's been flying around town?

25:11.717 --> 25:13.627
''Who was that lady l saw you with?''

25:13.958 --> 25:16.827
You mean, that's no lady, that's your wife?

25:29.734 --> 25:32.222
l like this place best
of all the spots l've been to.

25:32.325 --> 25:35.554
-You do?
-Maybe it's because l'm so happy.

25:35.654 --> 25:39.167
-Just think of it, Lucy. You'll be my wife.
-Yes, l am thinking of it.

25:39.238 --> 25:42.751
l've hoped for it
ever since that first night l met you.

25:42.885 --> 25:45.733
l can hardly wait for your final decree
to come along.

25:45.798 --> 25:47.685
lt'll come along, Dan.

25:47.974 --> 25:51.236
lncidentally,
here's my husband coming along.

25:55.078 --> 25:56.866
-Hello, folks.
-Hello.

25:56.966 --> 25:58.395
This is Dixie Belle Lee.

25:58.470 --> 26:02.910
This is Mrs. Warriner, and Mr. Leeson,
the gentleman Mrs. Warriner will marry.

26:03.014 --> 26:06.047
-lt's mighty fine meeting you.
-Now come along.

26:07.814 --> 26:10.432
Now, you're sure we're not intruding?

26:10.598 --> 26:13.467
-What do you mean?
-Wouldn't you like us to have a drink?

26:13.574 --> 26:16.541
-Yes, of course.
-Sit down.

26:21.606 --> 26:23.428
My, isn't this cozy?

26:33.925 --> 26:37.024
So, you two are going to be married.

26:37.094 --> 26:41.982
l was glad to hear that. l said to myself,
''That Leeson's just the man for Lucy.''

26:42.950 --> 26:46.114
-Then l said to myself--
-He's always talking to himself.

26:46.182 --> 26:48.865
-lsn't this a charming place?
-Do you really like it?

26:48.933 --> 26:51.617
l'm so glad.
l almost feel like the place is mine.

26:51.718 --> 26:55.329
-You come here often?
-l work here, didn't you know that?

26:55.430 --> 26:56.445
No.

26:56.550 --> 26:58.655
You're from the South, aren't you?

26:58.758 --> 27:02.587
Well, now isn't he just the cleverest gent?
How'd y'all ever guess that?

27:02.662 --> 27:05.662
l don't know, it was just a shot in the dark.

27:06.246 --> 27:08.548
But Dixie Belle Lee isn't her real name.

27:08.646 --> 27:11.035
-No?
-No, she changed it, you see...

27:11.205 --> 27:14.783
because her family objected
to her going into show business.

27:14.886 --> 27:19.109
My folks thought l was going to the dogs
when l decided to go to work.

27:19.206 --> 27:22.272
l'm sure you'll be a big success,
and then they'll be proud of you.

27:22.342 --> 27:26.116
Thank you. lt's real nice of you to say that.
l'd better go now and get ready.

27:26.246 --> 27:28.701
-Can you stay and see my act?
-We'll stay.

27:28.838 --> 27:32.035
-Nothing could drag us away.
-See you later, then.

27:35.558 --> 27:37.762
-She seems like a nice girl.
-lndeed.

27:37.830 --> 27:42.107
Enough about Dixie Belle for the moment.
Let's talk about yourselves.

27:42.630 --> 27:45.794
So you're going to live in Oklahoma, Lucy?
How l envy you.

27:45.894 --> 27:50.301
Ever since l was a small boy
that name has been filled with magic for me.

27:50.534 --> 27:51.843
Oklahoma.

27:53.734 --> 27:56.352
We're going to live right in Oklahoma City.

27:56.454 --> 27:58.428
Not Oklahoma City itself?

28:00.421 --> 28:02.210
Lucy, you lucky girl.

28:02.438 --> 28:05.089
No more running around the nightspots.

28:05.158 --> 28:07.973
No more prowling around
in New York shops.

28:08.261 --> 28:11.458
l'll think of you whenever a show opens
and say to myself:

28:11.526 --> 28:13.119
''She's well out of it.''

28:13.222 --> 28:16.767
New York's all right for a visit,
but l wouldn't want to live here.

28:16.838 --> 28:19.205
l know l'll enjoy Oklahoma City.

28:20.006 --> 28:24.381
Of course. lf it gets dull,
you can always go to Tulsa for the weekend.

28:25.733 --> 28:29.116
l think a big change
like that does one good.

28:29.221 --> 28:30.650
That's right.

28:31.782 --> 28:36.092
l know this isn't quite the place,
but Lucy tells me you two own a coal mine.

28:36.230 --> 28:37.212
What about it?

28:37.286 --> 28:41.825
Yes. Mr. Leeson thought that maybe
he'd like to buy your interest.

28:42.022 --> 28:43.996
That is, if the price is right.

28:44.102 --> 28:46.971
l was telling Mr. Leeson, l mean Daniel...

28:48.069 --> 28:52.379
about how badly we were doing,
and he thought maybe he could do better.

28:52.933 --> 28:56.414
l suppose you told him
there wasn't any coal in it, too.

28:57.061 --> 29:01.055
Well, if you're interested,
you might bring around the data tomorrow.

29:01.222 --> 29:02.748
l'm very lucky.

29:03.270 --> 29:05.856
You know what they call me back home?

29:07.077 --> 29:08.452
l can guess.

30:35.653 --> 30:36.831
l just met her.

30:53.862 --> 30:56.317
l guess it was easier for her
to change her name...

30:56.421 --> 30:59.204
than for a whole family to change theirs.

31:00.645 --> 31:02.620
That'd go great out West.

31:03.558 --> 31:06.427
Seemed to go pretty well
with the cowboy here.

31:07.077 --> 31:09.314
You want to change the subject?

31:09.382 --> 31:12.797
Why don't you two get up and dance?
Or don't you dance?

31:12.997 --> 31:15.518
Lucy doesn't care much about dancing.

31:15.590 --> 31:17.412
Didn't you know that?

31:20.453 --> 31:24.348
Did Lucy tell you that? She's holding out
on you. She's a beautiful dancer.

31:24.453 --> 31:27.802
Why, l used to call her ''Twinkle Toes.''
Hello, Twinkle Toes.

31:27.878 --> 31:30.114
Have you been fooling me, you little rascal?

31:30.213 --> 31:33.115
Honestly, l didn't think
you cared much about it.

31:33.189 --> 31:36.353
Care about it?
Why, l could dance till the cows come home.

31:36.454 --> 31:38.755
l won several cups at it myself.

31:38.949 --> 31:40.804
We never won any cups.

31:42.374 --> 31:44.578
Maybe you had the wrong partner.

31:44.902 --> 31:47.138
There's a lot in what you say.

31:49.061 --> 31:51.811
-Can l have this waltz, Lucy?
-Of course.

33:14.726 --> 33:17.344
Here, give this to the orchestra leader
and tell him...

33:17.445 --> 33:20.260
-to play the same number again.
-Yes, sir.

34:17.030 --> 34:18.175
Come on, sing.

34:23.781 --> 34:25.090
lt's ''all day.''

34:25.188 --> 34:26.618
-l'm sorry.
-lt's all right.

35:01.221 --> 35:03.294
-Not bad.
-Thanks.

35:03.397 --> 35:05.470
-Never had a lesson in my life.
-You don't say.

35:05.542 --> 35:07.876
-Have you?
-Well, yes.

35:07.941 --> 35:11.138
Let's sing another one.
That must be him now.

35:13.541 --> 35:15.843
-Hello, Warriner.
-Hello, Leeson.

35:16.710 --> 35:18.717
-Hello, Lucy.
-Hello, Jerry.

35:19.269 --> 35:21.408
-Glad you dropped up.
-Thanks.

35:22.661 --> 35:25.214
l really am very interested
in that mine of yours.

35:25.317 --> 35:28.666
Yes, l brought along all the records
and history of....

35:28.869 --> 35:32.186
l've looked all over for McCall's report
on that mine.

35:32.261 --> 35:35.131
-l can't find it anywhere. You must have it.
-Maybe l have.

35:35.237 --> 35:38.849
Next chance you get,
look through your stocking drawer.

35:38.949 --> 35:42.113
She always hides important things
in the top drawer of her dresser.

35:42.181 --> 35:43.425
She does?

35:44.421 --> 35:47.455
Every legal paper we had smelled of sachet.

35:47.557 --> 35:48.702
lt did?

35:50.149 --> 35:52.386
Even the marriage certificate.

35:53.605 --> 35:57.053
Remember when the clerk asked to see it
and you couldn't find it?

35:57.157 --> 36:00.703
We had a bunch of pals at the hotel.
They kept ribbing us all night.

36:01.701 --> 36:05.760
Remember when they sent the bellboy?
We didn't want ice water.

36:08.037 --> 36:09.020
No?

36:13.669 --> 36:15.229
What's the matter?

36:16.485 --> 36:19.867
When you two are married
the three of us can talk more freely.

36:20.197 --> 36:21.790
About this mine business...

36:21.893 --> 36:25.406
this place was formerly owned
by the Fullerton Brothers. They....

36:31.334 --> 36:34.716
You've heard of the Fullerton Brothers,
haven't you?

36:34.789 --> 36:35.804
Yes.

36:35.877 --> 36:39.358
lt seems they didn't know much
about the mining situation in Pennsylvania.

36:39.429 --> 36:41.949
-Their racket was mainly--
-Why, hello, Ma!

36:43.653 --> 36:45.442
-Hello.
-Hello, Mrs. Leeson.

36:45.541 --> 36:48.290
-Hello, Lucy.
-Ma, this is Mr. Jerry Warriner.

36:48.357 --> 36:50.529
-Not--
-Yes, ma'am, that's right.

36:50.597 --> 36:53.858
-We're discussing a business proposition.
-l see.

36:54.533 --> 36:56.802
-lt's funny seeing you.
-lt is?

36:57.605 --> 36:59.296
Well, it's funny seeing you.

36:59.397 --> 37:03.074
What l mean is, l was at a tea this afternoon
where some people...

37:03.173 --> 37:05.922
were speaking of you and of Lucy, too.

37:06.213 --> 37:09.213
They knew you both before the divorce.

37:11.493 --> 37:15.006
l'll bet you run into dozens of people
who knew us before the divorce.

37:15.301 --> 37:17.854
Yes, we used to get around quite a lot.
Didn't we?

37:19.269 --> 37:23.295
They spoke very well of you.
They said you were a real gentleman.

37:23.365 --> 37:25.340
Oh, did they really?

37:25.573 --> 37:28.093
And they were talking of Lucy, too.

37:28.549 --> 37:31.069
You know, you do sing divinely, dear.

37:31.141 --> 37:34.589
But l'd never realized till this afternoon
that you had a teacher...

37:34.661 --> 37:37.312
and a very handsome one, l understand.

37:38.757 --> 37:43.296
There was a woman there, if l hadn't been
a lady l would have slapped her face.

37:43.397 --> 37:46.658
-Why didn't you?
-l wish l had, because she insinuated....

37:46.789 --> 37:50.433
As a matter of fact,
she didn't even insinuate.

37:50.533 --> 37:54.210
Well, she was talking
about your divorcing Mr. Warriner.

37:56.709 --> 38:00.190
She came right out and said
that it should have been....

38:03.589 --> 38:05.694
No matter, no matter.

38:07.877 --> 38:10.398
-No matter.
-No matter.

38:10.469 --> 38:12.836
Let's get down to business, Leeson.

38:13.317 --> 38:16.797
lf l'd had time to work this mine myself,
l'd have made a fortune.

38:16.869 --> 38:19.935
But l was always too busy
making money for other people.

38:20.037 --> 38:23.168
There's a section up there
simply crying for someone to go in...

38:23.237 --> 38:25.441
who has the time and money to give it.

38:26.405 --> 38:29.950
l think if you could sink a shaft
in this north corner, right about here....

38:30.245 --> 38:31.968
Wait, let me show you something.

38:32.037 --> 38:35.201
l ought to tell you, Jerry,
nobody is listening to you.

38:35.269 --> 38:37.658
The girl's name needs clearing, partner.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.670
l wouldn't go so far as to say that.

38:40.997 --> 38:44.128
But l'm sure Mr. Warriner
is pleased at the opportunity...

38:44.197 --> 38:46.717
to deny that silly story
l heard this afternoon.

38:46.821 --> 38:49.788
Why, certainly, Mrs. Leeson. What is it?

38:50.533 --> 38:55.716
This woman said Mr. Warriner permitted you
to bring proceedings so that....

38:56.485 --> 38:59.682
Well, so that your reputation
wouldn't be ruined.

38:59.781 --> 39:02.651
There, it's out. l know it's silly but--

39:02.725 --> 39:04.797
Of course it's silly, and so are you.

39:04.901 --> 39:06.657
-What?
-See here, Warriner.

39:06.725 --> 39:10.369
l mean it's silly for your mother
to believe such nonsense.

39:10.469 --> 39:15.357
You see, our divorce was one of those
tragedies that you read about in the papers.

39:15.941 --> 39:18.811
A trusting woman and a worthless man.

39:19.653 --> 39:19.941
l was never good enough for Lucy
and finally she found it out.

39:19.941 --> 39:23.487
l was never good enough for Lucy
and finally she found it out.

39:23.781 --> 39:26.531
Lucy is above suspicion,
and always has been.

39:26.629 --> 39:31.135
She's as pure as the driven snow,
as faithful as she is fair.

39:32.709 --> 39:36.092
And l would that l had been worthy
to kiss the hem of her garment.

39:36.229 --> 39:39.611
Never during our marital bliss
did she cause me a moment's uneasiness.

39:39.717 --> 39:43.546
Never did l have to ask, ''Lucy, where
have you been, what were you doing?''

39:43.621 --> 39:44.930
l always knew.

39:46.469 --> 39:49.982
l tell you, something wonderful
went out of my life when l lost her.

39:50.053 --> 39:52.574
-l know just how you feel.
-How do you know?

39:52.677 --> 39:56.933
How can you know how it feels to have
used up the best years of a woman's life?

40:03.557 --> 40:05.662
Of course, that's the way it goes.

40:05.765 --> 40:08.383
Excuse me, you're sitting on my prospectus.

40:10.629 --> 40:14.306
Dan, take those and look them over.

40:15.045 --> 40:16.834
And let me know. And, Dan...

40:17.444 --> 40:18.939
take good care of her.

40:20.261 --> 40:21.919
l'll be going now.

40:25.189 --> 40:27.229
Yes, Dan, take good care of her.

40:27.365 --> 40:29.885
Maybe you'll succeed where l failed.

40:31.077 --> 40:35.682
l'm sure that the three of you will be
very happy out where the West begins.

40:37.893 --> 40:40.162
lf you ever think of me, send me a postcard.

40:40.229 --> 40:44.386
Just say, ''Having a wonderful time.''
l'll understand.

40:49.477 --> 40:50.721
Goodbye, now.

40:56.197 --> 40:59.329
Ma, are you convinced about everything?

40:59.684 --> 41:01.724
What about the music teacher?

41:03.077 --> 41:06.721
You two try and settle things for yourselves.
Let me know how it comes out.

41:06.821 --> 41:09.570
Put a light in the window if it's yes,
two if it's no.

41:09.637 --> 41:12.769
And if you can't make up your minds,
just pull down the shade.

41:33.892 --> 41:34.940
Hello.

41:35.013 --> 41:37.980
What are you doing in my apartment,
if l'm not too inquisitive?

41:38.053 --> 41:41.020
l thought after my swell reference
about you, l deserved a drink.

41:41.093 --> 41:44.126
-Wish l'd mixed it for you.
-l see what you mean.

41:45.893 --> 41:49.188
Certainly do appreciate
all the charming things you said about me.

41:49.252 --> 41:52.122
When l get the chance,
l hope l can do as much for you.

41:52.229 --> 41:54.684
lt was nothing at all.
l try to go through life--

41:54.789 --> 41:57.789
l know,
spreading a little sunshine as you go.

41:58.629 --> 42:01.215
No, frankly, l was worried about you.

42:02.533 --> 42:05.468
You've never asked for money.
Do you need any?

42:05.541 --> 42:08.574
No, l think l can struggle along
without any help from you.

42:08.677 --> 42:10.881
l thought maybe you made
a bad investment.

42:10.949 --> 42:14.331
-No. l only made one bad investment.
-Don't bite me.

42:14.724 --> 42:19.034
l thought that maybe Buffalo Bill's millions
might have something to do--

42:19.109 --> 42:20.636
Nothing to do with anything.

42:20.709 --> 42:23.458
Millions or no millions,
he's a very charming person.

42:23.557 --> 42:24.735
l've seen him.

42:26.565 --> 42:29.020
l can't possibly interpret this as jealousy.

42:29.124 --> 42:30.237
No.

42:31.237 --> 42:34.085
l've come out from behind those clouds.

42:34.628 --> 42:37.084
l've taken a definite turn for the better.

42:37.285 --> 42:39.489
Nothing's going to hurt me anymore.

42:42.725 --> 42:44.547
That's too bad, Jerry.

42:44.869 --> 42:47.073
-Did it hurt you much?
-No.

42:47.237 --> 42:49.757
-Just the one hand?
-Just the one hand.

42:50.948 --> 42:53.948
l'll be going.
l always like to leave people laughing.

42:54.053 --> 42:55.995
ls there anything l can get you for it?

42:56.100 --> 42:58.653
No, l'm a stout fellow, l'll carry on.

43:00.517 --> 43:02.884
-Where's Mr. Smith?
-Out with Aunt Patsy.

43:05.477 --> 43:07.713
Tell me something before l go, will you?

43:08.165 --> 43:10.882
-What do you see in this fellow?
-None of your business.

43:10.981 --> 43:15.520
Not that l care, but what kind of a line
could he have that would impress you?

43:15.621 --> 43:19.363
You might be surprised. You could take
a few lessons and profit nicely.

43:19.717 --> 43:22.651
You'd be surprised what l'd give
to get an earful of that.

43:22.724 --> 43:24.797
-You would.
-l couldn't wait to see you.

43:24.900 --> 43:27.519
l had to tell you
how awful l feel about what happened.

43:27.621 --> 43:30.338
You'll have to forgive Ma.
She's kind of old-fashioned.

43:30.404 --> 43:32.739
-l'll forgive her.
-You won't hold it against her?

43:32.805 --> 43:35.772
No. Now you go and dress for dinner.
We'll be very late.

43:36.068 --> 43:37.727
l'm a lot quicker than you are.

43:37.829 --> 43:40.960
Just to prove that you're not mad,
will you give me a little kiss?

43:41.061 --> 43:44.160
-Right here in the hall? Don't be silly.
-There's nobody around.

43:44.260 --> 43:46.911
-You never can tell if someone's around.
-l'll come in.

43:46.980 --> 43:49.533
Don't come in. We'll be awfully late.

43:49.637 --> 43:51.459
-Don't be bashful.
-l'm not bashful.

43:51.557 --> 43:55.332
l've never kissed you before.
And l don't think this is exactly the place.

43:55.428 --> 43:59.323
lf you knew how crazy l am about you,
you wouldn't hesitate. l can't sleep nights.

43:59.429 --> 44:01.850
-Try drinking some hot milk.
-l must be in love...

44:01.957 --> 44:04.706
-because l started writing poetry to you.
-Poetry.

44:04.772 --> 44:08.896
l was going to surprise you with it at dinner,
but it's short. lt goes like this:

44:09.701 --> 44:14.076
''To you, my little prairie flower
l'm thinking of you every hour

44:14.181 --> 44:18.109
''Though now you're just a friend to me
l wonder what the end will be''

44:19.268 --> 44:22.400
Excuse me, Dan,
l do laugh at the oddest times.

44:23.909 --> 44:25.632
You see what l mean?

44:31.781 --> 44:34.432
''Oh, you would make my life divine

44:34.501 --> 44:37.316
''if you would change your name to mine''

44:38.693 --> 44:39.969
That's really....

44:40.036 --> 44:43.517
That's beautiful, Dan.
lt's really beautiful. There's my phone.

44:43.589 --> 44:46.109
You've got to go now, really.

44:46.565 --> 44:48.604
-Hello.
-Comment ça va, madame?

44:49.093 --> 44:52.922
-You haven't forgotten about tomorrow?
-Look, l have company.

44:54.532 --> 44:57.314
All right, wait a minute, hold the phone.

44:59.909 --> 45:03.040
There, now go on, Dan, l'll see you later.

45:07.684 --> 45:10.848
Lucy, you've made me
the happiest man in the world.

45:10.916 --> 45:15.456
Dreamed of this moment for days,
now it's all come true.

45:16.133 --> 45:17.540
Dan, really!

45:18.405 --> 45:23.074
l'll go home now and dress for dinner.
l'm so happy l could eat three steaks.

45:27.524 --> 45:28.734
Hello?

45:37.892 --> 45:38.874
Telephone.

45:42.373 --> 45:43.355
Hello?

45:43.492 --> 45:45.183
Can l expect you tomorrow?

45:45.253 --> 45:49.279
At 3:00 tomorrow afternoon?
l think that would be convenient.

45:50.181 --> 45:52.930
Very well then, 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.
Goodbye.

45:54.308 --> 45:56.926
-Who was that?
-Why should it interest you?

45:57.989 --> 46:00.836
Wait a minute, after all,
the final decree isn't in yet.

46:00.901 --> 46:03.584
-lf you must know, it was my masseuse.
-My who?

46:05.061 --> 46:08.705
l've heard everything. l'm going out
to get some popcorn and pink lemonade.

46:08.772 --> 46:11.293
l've just seen a three-ring circus.

46:26.237 --> 46:27.862
Armand Duvalle in?

46:27.965 --> 46:30.648
-Please, your name?
-Jerry Warriner. ls my wife here?

46:30.749 --> 46:32.025
l do not know.

46:32.636 --> 46:34.491
What do you mean you don't know?

46:34.652 --> 46:37.914
-l only know l don't know.
-You wouldn't mind if l look around.

46:38.013 --> 46:39.223
Me, jujitsu.

46:45.372 --> 46:47.195
-Me, jujitsu.
-ls that so?

46:51.420 --> 46:52.794
Me, jujitsu, too.

46:54.493 --> 46:57.242
You must not go in.
You must not disturb him.

46:57.340 --> 46:59.893
l can't go in, he must not be disturbed.

48:04.061 --> 48:06.930
You should have seen your master
this afternoon.

48:07.357 --> 48:09.146
Come on, sit up, boy.

48:12.060 --> 48:13.751
No, better still, l tell you...

48:13.821 --> 48:16.439
go hide your eyes
and l'll give it to you that way.

48:18.461 --> 48:22.355
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five.
No peeking.

48:23.132 --> 48:26.580
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty,
twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five. You ready?

48:26.684 --> 48:29.140
All right, then, come on.

48:30.044 --> 48:31.670
You're too smart.

48:32.957 --> 48:35.804
Honestly, Patsy,
you should have seen Jerry this afternoon.

48:35.868 --> 48:39.130
And when that chair
started to slip from under him.

48:39.196 --> 48:43.190
-l will say that for Jerry, he's never dull.
-He was so silly, though.

48:43.292 --> 48:46.009
l know he thought he'd find me
in Armand's arms.

48:46.076 --> 48:48.149
He must have been terribly disappointed.

48:48.252 --> 48:51.929
He must have felt awful
about not finding you two in a clinch.

48:51.996 --> 48:55.771
Jerry's always had the most fantastic way
of getting into scrapes.

48:55.836 --> 48:58.008
We've had some grand laughs together.

48:58.077 --> 49:00.695
But a girl really wants
dependability and security.

49:00.764 --> 49:02.073
Yes, l suppose she does.

49:02.173 --> 49:04.955
Then she ought to buy an annuity.
Be more fun than Leeson.

49:05.053 --> 49:07.420
Don't explain. l'm not marrying him.

49:07.484 --> 49:10.615
That's what l wanted to tell you.
l'm not either.

49:11.100 --> 49:14.581
l can't marry him because l'm still in love
with that crazy lunatic.

49:14.653 --> 49:17.304
And there's nothing l can do about it.

49:19.004 --> 49:22.103
Patsy, here and there, now and then...

49:22.173 --> 49:25.042
-l've done a few things for you, haven't l?
-Yes.

49:25.148 --> 49:29.404
Here's a note that l've written to Dan
explaining exactly why l can't marry him.

49:29.501 --> 49:33.243
l could never phrase anything in person
as beautifully as l have in this note.

49:33.372 --> 49:35.761
But now l've lost my nerve
about giving it to him.

49:35.869 --> 49:38.803
-Could you sort of see that he gets it?
-l should say so.

49:38.909 --> 49:41.178
Well, l tried to forget Jerry.

49:42.268 --> 49:43.250
l know.

49:43.388 --> 49:47.218
That's why you jumped at Leeson
as if he were the last man on earth.

49:47.389 --> 49:49.014
l'll answer that.

49:54.717 --> 49:57.531
Every time l open the door
somebody walks in.

49:57.628 --> 49:59.384
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

50:03.517 --> 50:05.589
-Hello, Armand.
-You sent for me, madam.

50:05.660 --> 50:08.344
Yes, l've been so embarrassed
about what happened...

50:08.444 --> 50:11.412
in front of your guests
l couldn't get out of there soon enough.

50:11.516 --> 50:14.134
Your husband is a very funny man, isn't he?

50:14.236 --> 50:17.913
l'm convinced he must care about me
or he wouldn't do those funny things.

50:17.980 --> 50:20.435
Yes, but he doesn't care much about me.

50:20.508 --> 50:23.737
No, Armand, that's just what l'm getting at.

50:25.020 --> 50:28.468
-l'm wondering, could you do me a favor?
-But of course.

50:28.669 --> 50:30.075
l've been thinking...

50:31.868 --> 50:33.908
l wonder if you could convince him...

50:34.012 --> 50:37.308
that everything was just as l said it was
that night at the inn.

50:37.404 --> 50:38.899
l'd be glad to.

50:39.004 --> 50:41.721
But does he carry a gun?

50:41.853 --> 50:43.194
You're not afraid of him?

50:43.996 --> 50:47.345
-Of course not, but--
-Will you do it for me? As soon as possible?

50:47.452 --> 50:48.434
Yes.

50:48.508 --> 50:51.923
And, by all means, he mustn't know
that l had anything to do with it.

50:51.996 --> 50:53.818
-No.
-As soon as possible.

50:58.333 --> 51:00.537
Mr. Smith! How are you?

51:02.044 --> 51:04.084
-But this is much too soon.
-lsn't it?

51:04.156 --> 51:06.360
-Much too soon.
-What can l do?

51:06.461 --> 51:09.046
-You can't keep standing here.
-l know, but where can l go?

51:09.116 --> 51:10.523
-Look, out here.
-No.

51:10.620 --> 51:11.994
Look, in the bedroom. Hurry up.

51:16.988 --> 51:19.224
-Hiya, fellow.
-Hello, Jerry.

51:19.292 --> 51:21.878
-Hello, Patsy. How have you been?
-Fine.

51:22.012 --> 51:24.663
You knew it was me, didn't you?
Sure you did.

51:29.788 --> 51:32.406
You remembered me, didn't you?
Sure, you bet.

51:35.228 --> 51:36.821
Get away.

51:38.460 --> 51:41.177
-Hello, Jerry.
-Hello, Lucy.

51:41.437 --> 51:44.503
-l suppose you know why l dropped in.
-No, l don't exactly.

51:44.572 --> 51:48.882
As a matter of fact, l came to apologize for
my behavior today in Duvalle's apartment...

51:48.988 --> 51:51.738
-studio, or whatever he calls his joint.
-Oh, that?

51:51.837 --> 51:54.422
l certainly acted like a prize lunatic,
and l'm sorry.

51:54.492 --> 51:56.729
-lt was nothing at all.
-Nothing?

51:57.212 --> 52:00.376
Nothing except the most ridiculous
and sickening exhibition...

52:00.477 --> 52:02.233
mortal man ever made of himself.

52:02.460 --> 52:04.248
l don't know why l act like that.

52:04.348 --> 52:07.098
Unless it's because of the effect
that Duvalle has on me.

52:07.197 --> 52:09.946
l never knew anyone
that can aggravate me the way he does.

52:10.044 --> 52:13.622
-l can't think about him without seeing red.
-You shouldn't get so excited.

52:13.756 --> 52:17.018
A mere mention of his name
and l feel positively murderous.

52:17.116 --> 52:18.360
You do?

52:20.636 --> 52:22.709
-What's the matter with you?
-Nothing.

52:22.780 --> 52:26.129
l was just thinking about your problem.
You certainly have a problem.

52:26.236 --> 52:28.986
l know l have a problem,
and l know how l feel, too.

52:29.244 --> 52:31.633
l guess there's nothing l can do about it.

52:35.964 --> 52:37.622
Look at Mr. Smith.

52:38.492 --> 52:40.728
-l guess he wants to play.
-Yes.

52:42.524 --> 52:44.913
Here, you go and hide it for him.

52:46.492 --> 52:48.434
No fair peeking, Smitty.

53:02.300 --> 53:04.307
All right, let's go. Come on.

53:04.476 --> 53:06.516
Oh, no, you're cold.

53:06.621 --> 53:08.377
You're colder than ice. Cold, cold.

53:08.444 --> 53:10.713
Oh, boy, what's wrong with you?

53:14.876 --> 53:17.527
Nice going, fellow. Let it go. Good boy.

53:19.453 --> 53:20.914
Well, Lucy...

53:24.092 --> 53:27.060
the main idea is, do you accept my apology?

53:29.468 --> 53:33.559
Besides making a blue-ribbon sap of myself
today, l must have embarrassed you terribly.

53:33.660 --> 53:34.969
You took it fine, though.

53:35.069 --> 53:37.622
-You must admit you were--
-Yes.

53:37.980 --> 53:41.941
-What was that?
-Nothing, just an old mirror.

53:43.388 --> 53:46.771
-The boy's getting worse every day.
-Mr. Smith, that's a fine thing.

53:46.876 --> 53:49.113
l'm surprised at you.
Trying to get rid of me?

53:49.180 --> 53:51.831
No, he wasn't trying to get rid of you,
you know it.

53:52.476 --> 53:55.443
Well, l really hadn't planned
to leave so soon.

53:55.548 --> 53:59.410
l thought, if you have nothing to do,
you might like to go for a drive with me.

53:59.548 --> 54:02.963
Well, the air will do you good,
and we can talk things over?

54:03.068 --> 54:06.068
-l'd love that. Yes, it would do me good.
-Swell.

54:06.140 --> 54:08.507
-Where's your car?
-Downstairs, in the garage.

54:08.572 --> 54:12.979
While l'm changing,
you get the car and l'll meet you out front.

54:13.084 --> 54:15.473
-Okay, dear.
-l won't be a minute.

54:34.460 --> 54:37.624
That's funny, l only bought the hat
an hour ago and look at it.

54:37.852 --> 54:39.445
Did you have a haircut, maybe?

54:40.444 --> 54:42.200
-No.
-No?

54:42.332 --> 54:45.430
Maybe you have it on backwards.
Put it on the other way around.

54:45.532 --> 54:48.118
Well, l hadn't thought of that. Wait a minute.

54:51.676 --> 54:54.261
Yes, there, now that's more becoming.

55:00.412 --> 55:03.510
lt is a bit roomy. Maybe they're wearing
them that way this year.

55:03.612 --> 55:04.627
Well, l'm not.

55:05.884 --> 55:07.258
Looks mighty funny to me.

55:07.324 --> 55:10.139
Look at your ears. That's why.
Your ears are all down.

55:10.204 --> 55:11.765
What's wrong with it?

55:11.836 --> 55:14.203
-Stick your ears up underneath.
-Don't be silly.

55:14.300 --> 55:16.756
How can you stick your ears up?
That's no good.

55:16.796 --> 55:17.974
Well, l always put my ears in.

55:25.340 --> 55:28.057
-Who's there?
-Me, and my ma.

55:29.788 --> 55:32.755
Lucy, l've caused you enough trouble
for one day.

55:32.860 --> 55:35.762
He better not find me here.
l'll duck in the other room.

55:35.900 --> 55:36.882
No, no, but....

55:38.748 --> 55:39.861
Could you....

55:46.812 --> 55:48.568
-Hello, there.
-Hello, Aunt Patsy.

55:48.668 --> 55:50.293
Good evening, Mrs. Leeson.

55:50.396 --> 55:51.770
Good evening, Mrs. Leeson.

55:51.868 --> 55:55.184
Lucy, you didn't come over this morning
the way you usually do.

55:55.260 --> 55:58.872
-l was so busy this morning.
-That's what l kept telling you, Ma.

55:58.940 --> 56:01.809
-Do you mind if l sit down?
-No, not at all.

56:07.836 --> 56:11.032
-l've got an awful headache.
-Well, l'm getting one.

56:11.388 --> 56:15.316
l thought maybe you were angry
at my repeating what that awful....

56:15.900 --> 56:17.907
Nonsense, Mrs. Leeson.

56:18.268 --> 56:21.781
-What on earth was that?
-Somebody's cleaning up in there.

56:24.636 --> 56:25.946
l was afraid....

56:26.844 --> 56:28.666
-Must they do that?
-Yes--

56:30.780 --> 56:34.457
l was afraid, but l knew that in your heart
you knew...

56:34.556 --> 56:36.443
that l never suspected you.

56:36.668 --> 56:38.261
Of course not, Mrs. Leeson.

56:38.364 --> 56:43.798
The first time Dan talked about you, l said,
''Why, she sounds like a sweet little thing.''

56:43.900 --> 56:46.518
Why, to know Lucy is to love her.

56:46.876 --> 56:49.974
Lucy, l got a surprise for you.
Ma and l talked it all over.

56:50.044 --> 56:53.393
l hope you are going to like Oklahoma,
because l'm going to ask you....

56:54.844 --> 56:56.153
Excuse me.

56:59.036 --> 57:00.946
They forgot to touch second.

57:07.932 --> 57:09.361
Come on, Dan.

57:10.300 --> 57:13.431
Well, l guess a man's best friend
is his mother.

57:17.660 --> 57:20.213
l certainly learned about women from you.

57:20.892 --> 57:23.347
-Here's your diploma.
-Come on.

57:31.228 --> 57:33.617
What's the matter with you, Smitty?

57:36.188 --> 57:38.838
l see what you mean. Patsy, look at this.

57:40.636 --> 57:42.774
Oh, yes, that's Barbara Vance.

57:42.876 --> 57:46.105
-You know who she is, don't you?
-Yes, l know who she is.

57:46.204 --> 57:49.171
The madcap heiress. lsn't that
what the papers usually call her?

57:49.276 --> 57:53.553
Millions of dollars and no sense.
l wonder what she's doing with Jerry.

57:53.628 --> 57:56.311
Entertaining him,
running around town with him...

57:56.412 --> 57:58.997
and l imagine falling in love with him.
That's all.

57:59.068 --> 58:01.686
-You can't tell all that from this picture.
-No.

58:01.756 --> 58:06.676
But l can tell it from what l've heard.
lf rumor is true, Barbara is quite a girl.

58:06.748 --> 58:08.123
And Jerry's having a lot of fun.

59:16.348 --> 59:17.460
Come in.

59:19.228 --> 59:20.210
Hello, Jerry.

59:21.500 --> 59:23.987
Hello, Lucy, what's the nature of this visit?

59:24.220 --> 59:26.325
Well, l just thought l'd....

59:26.428 --> 59:28.370
-Do you know what today is?
-Certainly.

59:28.476 --> 59:32.153
Our divorce becomes final today.
Tomorrow, we'll both be back in circulation.

59:32.220 --> 59:34.937
l just thought l'd drop up
and wish you a lot of luck.

59:35.036 --> 59:38.385
That's very nice of you.
Would you like to join me for some wine?

59:38.459 --> 59:40.150
Of course l would.

59:41.884 --> 59:45.812
That was a cute picture of you and Barbara
in the morning paper.

59:47.644 --> 59:50.775
l love the caption: ''Off with the old love.''

59:50.876 --> 59:53.626
l thought ''Out of the frying pan''
might have been better.

59:53.723 --> 59:54.705
ls that so?

59:55.228 --> 59:58.905
Well, l think that Barbara and l
will be very happy together.

59:59.004 --> 01:00:00.891
l'm sure you'll be very happy.

01:00:01.116 --> 01:00:04.563
Only l don't think
you'll be as happy as Daniel and l.

01:00:05.884 --> 01:00:06.997
What?

01:00:08.412 --> 01:00:11.761
-ls that still on?
-What do you mean, ''ls that still on?''

01:00:12.667 --> 01:00:14.740
After that two-men-in-a-bedroom farce...

01:00:14.843 --> 01:00:17.778
l sort of imagined that when we left, he left.

01:00:17.884 --> 01:00:21.145
Oh, no. l just explained things to him
very simply.

01:00:21.436 --> 01:00:22.483
Oh, did you?

01:00:22.556 --> 01:00:24.443
Did you say our cars broke down...

01:00:24.508 --> 01:00:27.442
and we had to stay at your place
because of the taxi strike?

01:00:27.516 --> 01:00:30.004
No, l didn't tell him that. l told him the truth.

01:00:30.076 --> 01:00:32.378
And, strangely enough, he believed me.

01:00:32.444 --> 01:00:33.971
Yes, it was very refreshing.

01:00:34.043 --> 01:00:36.083
Well, what shall we drink to?

01:00:36.284 --> 01:00:38.356
Let's drink to our future.

01:00:40.284 --> 01:00:43.317
Here's hoping you and Barbara
will be very happy...

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:45.362
which l doubt very much.

01:00:45.756 --> 01:00:48.211
Let's drink to your happiness
with Buffalo Bill...

01:00:48.283 --> 01:00:50.901
-Good.
-...which doesn't even make sense.

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:54.809
-l'll tell you. We'll drink to the two of us.
-Good.

01:00:55.259 --> 01:00:57.528
As we go down life's highway...

01:00:57.852 --> 01:00:59.794
you going your way...

01:01:00.284 --> 01:01:02.007
and l going my way.

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:05.205
-Okay?
-All right.

01:01:08.859 --> 01:01:10.266
lt's flat.

01:01:10.812 --> 01:01:12.852
l'll open another bottle.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:20.017
You'll have to hurry it up though
because l'm meeting Daniel.

01:01:23.196 --> 01:01:26.774
l think champagne is so fitting
to round out our romance.

01:01:27.612 --> 01:01:30.230
l remember the first drink
we ever had together.

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.689
You, in your very best manner, said:

01:01:32.796 --> 01:01:34.738
''lt must be champagne.''

01:01:35.035 --> 01:01:37.207
And then you offered a toast,
you remember?

01:01:37.307 --> 01:01:40.439
-No, l don't.
-Well, being a woman, l do.

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:42.267
You said....

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.300
This'll land you a laugh.

01:01:46.139 --> 01:01:47.546
You said:

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:51.380
''Lend an ear, l implore you

01:01:52.284 --> 01:01:56.692
''This comes from my heart
l'll always adore you

01:01:57.659 --> 01:01:59.634
''Till death do us part''

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:05.016
Remember?

01:02:11.132 --> 01:02:12.920
lt was pretty swell.

01:02:13.787 --> 01:02:15.762
l mean, while it lasted.

01:02:18.427 --> 01:02:20.762
All beautiful things must end...

01:02:21.915 --> 01:02:24.501
so l guess we may as well call it a day.

01:02:28.572 --> 01:02:30.994
lf you don't mind, l'll call a car.

01:02:37.275 --> 01:02:40.952
Would you call a car for me?
Right away, please.

01:02:45.115 --> 01:02:46.293
Hello?

01:02:47.004 --> 01:02:48.859
Who's this, may l ask?

01:02:49.563 --> 01:02:54.233
lt's what's-her-name. l only said hello.
Maybe you can pick it up from there.

01:02:54.844 --> 01:02:58.586
-Did you have to answer my phone?
-l thought it was about the car. l'm sorry.

01:02:58.651 --> 01:03:00.506
What am l going to tell her?

01:03:00.923 --> 01:03:03.923
You can think of something.
You always could.

01:03:04.603 --> 01:03:08.531
-l haven't time to think of anything.
-Tell her you'll call her back.

01:03:09.084 --> 01:03:12.978
-How can l tell her l'll call her back?
-Then tell her to call you back.

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:16.186
Hello? Hello, darling.

01:03:16.924 --> 01:03:20.502
Well, it took you long enough.
Have you decided who the woman is?

01:03:20.571 --> 01:03:23.418
lsn't that funny,
l knew you were going to ask me that.

01:03:23.515 --> 01:03:25.490
-So did l.
-Quiet.

01:03:27.099 --> 01:03:29.009
lt's very simple, dear. lt's my sister.

01:03:29.084 --> 01:03:32.018
Your sister?
How are you going to get out of that?

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.903
She just got back from Paris,
dropped in to see me.

01:03:34.971 --> 01:03:36.564
Jerry, you're slipping.

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:41.937
l'd love to meet your sister.
Why don't you bring her along tonight?

01:03:42.011 --> 01:03:44.859
She can't come this evening.
She has a previous engagement.

01:03:44.923 --> 01:03:46.810
She wants me to come over?

01:03:46.907 --> 01:03:49.296
Naturally she's anxious
to meet you, too, but....

01:03:49.371 --> 01:03:53.048
Yes, tell her l'd love to meet her.
Tell her to wear boxing gloves.

01:03:53.692 --> 01:03:56.539
She said she'll break her engagement
and come over later.

01:03:56.636 --> 01:03:58.937
-But l strongly doubt that....
-Yes, l doubt it.

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:02.581
Dear, l'll do my best to fix it up
so the two of you meet very soon.

01:04:02.652 --> 01:04:04.375
-Yes. Goodbye.
-That'd be lovely.

01:04:06.267 --> 01:04:08.689
l'm in a fine fix.
She wants to meet my sister.

01:04:08.795 --> 01:04:12.374
-You're a big help.
-You know me. Anything l can do....

01:04:12.635 --> 01:04:15.091
-What? To break it up?
-l see what you mean.

01:04:15.195 --> 01:04:16.919
l'm in a fine mess.

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:21.303
Yes, hello? l did it again.

01:04:21.788 --> 01:04:23.959
What does she do? Call every five minutes?

01:04:24.028 --> 01:04:26.679
-You shouldn't take that from anybody.
-Hello, Barbara.

01:04:26.748 --> 01:04:28.057
Put your foot down....

01:04:28.156 --> 01:04:31.985
-l told you she couldn't make it this evening.
-She can't get away with it.

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:35.224
There's no reason to call me
every five minutes about it, is there?

01:04:35.323 --> 01:04:37.079
No. Well, all right.

01:04:46.396 --> 01:04:48.981
-Good evening, Mr. Warriner.
-Good evening.

01:04:58.811 --> 01:05:00.404
-Hello, Barbara.
-Hello.

01:05:00.604 --> 01:05:02.164
Good evening, Mrs. Vance.

01:05:02.235 --> 01:05:03.991
-Hello, Mr. Vance.
-Jerry.

01:05:04.123 --> 01:05:05.879
Where's your sister?

01:05:06.812 --> 01:05:09.529
She was terribly sorry
she couldn't be here tonight.

01:05:09.596 --> 01:05:13.524
She didn't weather the boat trip well.
When l left, she was calling the doctor.

01:05:13.596 --> 01:05:16.531
You can imagine my surprise
when a woman answered the phone.

01:05:16.603 --> 01:05:18.807
You can't blame me for being suspicious.

01:05:18.875 --> 01:05:22.356
Barbara, you can't have a happy married life
if you're always suspicious.

01:05:22.843 --> 01:05:24.534
There can't be doubts in marriage.

01:05:24.604 --> 01:05:27.920
Marriage is based on faith.
lf you lose that, you've lost everything.

01:05:28.028 --> 01:05:29.850
Very well said, Jerry.

01:05:30.012 --> 01:05:33.460
Yes, wasn't it?
l think l read it in a book or something.

01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:37.522
l was just thinking,
will your sister be here for the wedding?

01:05:38.363 --> 01:05:42.738
-l doubt that very much, Mrs. Vance.
-Maybe l should ask her to be a bridesmaid.

01:05:43.804 --> 01:05:46.619
l think she's sailing back to Paris
almost immediately.

01:05:46.684 --> 01:05:48.985
She said she'll try
to see you before she goes.

01:05:49.052 --> 01:05:50.939
You'd like my sister. She's your type.

01:05:51.036 --> 01:05:52.978
-Where did she go to school?
-Excuse me?

01:05:53.052 --> 01:05:56.150
-l said, where did she go to school?
-ln Switzerland.

01:05:57.211 --> 01:06:01.466
-You say your father was a Princeton man?
-That's right, sir. Class of '92.

01:06:01.979 --> 01:06:04.729
He tells some funny stories
about the place in those days.

01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:07.217
He tells one in particular
about a football game.

01:06:07.292 --> 01:06:09.681
lt seems Yale was playing
Princeton one day...

01:06:09.787 --> 01:06:13.584
and with the ball
on Princeton's two yard line, Yale fumbled.

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:16.856
A minute to go, Dad picked up the ball,
and ran....

01:06:17.883 --> 01:06:19.825
Miss Lola Warriner.

01:06:33.659 --> 01:06:36.180
Hello, brother dear. l made it.

01:06:38.524 --> 01:06:40.433
What did you say, dear?

01:06:41.435 --> 01:06:45.396
-l just asked how you were feeling.
-l'm feeling fine. And you?

01:06:47.835 --> 01:06:50.071
Mrs. Vance, may l present my sister, Lola.

01:06:50.171 --> 01:06:51.448
How do you do?

01:06:51.516 --> 01:06:54.036
-lt's lovely to know you.
-Thank you.

01:06:54.555 --> 01:06:56.791
-Won't you come in?
-Thank you.

01:07:03.003 --> 01:07:05.720
-Barbara, this is Lola.
-How do you do?

01:07:05.819 --> 01:07:07.608
lt's nice to be able to meet you.

01:07:07.676 --> 01:07:10.163
l've seen your pictures,
and wondered how you look.

01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:12.690
-l wondered about you, too.
-Well, thank you.

01:07:12.763 --> 01:07:14.389
-Lola?
-Yes, dear?

01:07:15.004 --> 01:07:17.175
This is Barbara's father, Mr. Vance.

01:07:17.243 --> 01:07:19.512
-Mr. Vance, my sister.
-How do you do?

01:07:20.603 --> 01:07:22.229
What's the matter?

01:07:22.332 --> 01:07:25.910
Nothing, only l never would have known you
from his description.

01:07:26.011 --> 01:07:28.728
-Won't you sit down?
-Thank you.

01:07:36.763 --> 01:07:40.757
Did l interrupt something?
Weren't you talking when l came in for....

01:07:41.243 --> 01:07:43.545
Would you excuse me, Mrs. Vance?
My handkerchief.

01:07:43.611 --> 01:07:44.821
Thank you.

01:07:46.491 --> 01:07:49.393
lt's me. lsn't that silly?

01:07:52.923 --> 01:07:54.614
lt's you this time, Mrs. Vance.

01:07:54.683 --> 01:07:57.999
Look, l'll just put it over here,
and get it out of the way.

01:08:00.155 --> 01:08:01.137
Dear!

01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:03.829
l guess that could go on and on and on.

01:08:03.899 --> 01:08:05.176
l hope not.

01:08:08.156 --> 01:08:09.749
Go on with your story, honey.

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:12.853
Yes, l was telling a story about my,
about our father.

01:08:12.956 --> 01:08:14.166
Oh, you were?

01:08:14.268 --> 01:08:17.366
l don't want to be rude,
but may l have a drink?

01:08:18.075 --> 01:08:22.581
l had three or four before l came, but
they're wearing off, you know how that is.

01:08:24.443 --> 01:08:28.533
Don't look at me like that.
You like a little drink yourself.

01:08:30.107 --> 01:08:32.310
We call him Jerry the Nipper.

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:36.853
Likes to sneak it when nobody's looking.
So cute about it, too.

01:08:37.403 --> 01:08:40.502
l've seen him go an evening,
apparently having nothing to drink...

01:08:40.603 --> 01:08:43.319
and all of a sudden, fall flat on his puss.

01:08:47.131 --> 01:08:49.040
A glass of sherry, perhaps?

01:08:49.115 --> 01:08:52.082
Will you get Miss Warriner
a glass of sherry?

01:08:53.082 --> 01:08:55.701
A glass of sherry? Excuse me.

01:08:55.962 --> 01:08:57.523
l don't like sherry.

01:09:00.314 --> 01:09:03.216
-Would you make that ginger ale please?
-Ginger ale?

01:09:07.611 --> 01:09:12.084
l'm sorry to interrupt you again, Jerry.
Now, what were you saying?

01:09:12.154 --> 01:09:15.930
l was just telling one of Father's stories.
You've heard it.

01:09:16.059 --> 01:09:18.033
With a minute to go, Dad had the ball--

01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:20.595
-A ball? What ball?
-The football.

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:23.995
What in the world was Dad ever doing
with a football?

01:09:24.859 --> 01:09:29.202
l was just telling a story about when Father
was at Princeton. You remember--

01:09:29.274 --> 01:09:32.057
Oh, yes, of course l remember.
Pop loved Princeton.

01:09:32.122 --> 01:09:34.064
He was there nearly 20 years.

01:09:34.651 --> 01:09:37.814
lf ever a man loved a place, he did.
He just adored it.

01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:40.881
And he certainly kept it looking beautiful.

01:09:41.691 --> 01:09:43.578
You've seen the grounds, of course.

01:09:43.643 --> 01:09:44.854
Of course?

01:09:46.267 --> 01:09:47.729
-Thank you.
-l'm afraid l'm--

01:09:48.411 --> 01:09:49.654
So sorry!

01:09:49.723 --> 01:09:51.631
-Here's your handkerchief.
-Thank you.

01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:55.285
l'm afraid that my sister
has a somewhat distorted sense of humor.

01:09:55.387 --> 01:09:56.281
So have l.

01:09:56.379 --> 01:09:58.932
What she meant was,
Father presented the college...

01:09:59.003 --> 01:10:01.272
with some of its finest landscapings.

01:10:02.587 --> 01:10:06.897
Excuse me. Was l thirsty!
lt must have been that ham l had for dinner.

01:10:10.588 --> 01:10:13.784
-l think my brother's pretty swell, don't you?
-Oh, yes.

01:10:14.011 --> 01:10:16.084
He's always been pretty swell to me.

01:10:16.187 --> 01:10:18.643
l was working my head off
at the Virginia Club.

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:22.489
But the minute he started doing better,
you know what l mean...

01:10:22.587 --> 01:10:27.159
why, he made me give up my job
and take a trip to London and Paris...

01:10:27.227 --> 01:10:29.944
and.... l think that was pretty swell,
don't you?

01:10:30.043 --> 01:10:31.865
What did you do at the Virginia Club?

01:10:31.963 --> 01:10:33.872
-You see--
-l'll tell her!

01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:37.397
lt was a little act, kind of....

01:10:37.787 --> 01:10:39.696
Well, it's a little hard to explain.

01:10:39.803 --> 01:10:42.258
-Have you got any records?
-Records?

01:10:42.427 --> 01:10:45.776
-Yes. We have some records.
-Well, maybe if we....

01:10:46.523 --> 01:10:48.214
Say, wait a minute!

01:10:51.963 --> 01:10:54.385
Don't anybody leave this room.
l've lost my purse.

01:10:54.491 --> 01:10:58.386
-Why, here it is.
-Well, am l relieved.

01:10:59.227 --> 01:11:00.788
Where are the records?

01:11:00.891 --> 01:11:03.193
Come this way and l'll show you.

01:11:04.187 --> 01:11:06.970
Look, will you keep an eye on that for me?

01:11:11.323 --> 01:11:14.389
Here's my song.
Would you like to have me do it for you?

01:11:14.491 --> 01:11:16.433
-Well, no, l don't--
-Okay.

01:11:17.275 --> 01:11:21.269
You'll have to put that on.
lt's a little fancy for me.

01:11:21.403 --> 01:11:24.054
The one we've got at home, you just wind.

01:11:24.123 --> 01:11:25.552
l wouldn't, if l were you.

01:11:25.659 --> 01:11:27.928
l won't do it the way l did at the club...

01:11:27.996 --> 01:11:30.330
if that's what you're afraid of.

01:11:30.395 --> 01:11:32.118
You think l'm a fool?

01:11:33.179 --> 01:11:34.935
The number has some wind effects...

01:11:35.003 --> 01:11:38.778
but you'll just have to use
your own imagination about them.

01:11:50.587 --> 01:11:51.252
Get it?

01:12:22.811 --> 01:12:24.088
l never could do that.

01:12:30.747 --> 01:12:32.657
Are we going so soon?

01:12:32.763 --> 01:12:34.738
l was just beginning to enjoy myself.

01:12:34.843 --> 01:12:37.112
Good night. Good night, all.

01:12:42.459 --> 01:12:45.176
-Where are you going?
-l'm going to Patsy's cabin.

01:12:45.275 --> 01:12:49.552
-You're not in any condition to drive.
-l can make it in two minutes on two wheels.

01:12:49.627 --> 01:12:50.871
That's what you think.

01:12:50.939 --> 01:12:53.786
-Get over.
-This is my car. l want to drive my car.

01:12:53.883 --> 01:12:54.898
-Over.
-No.

01:12:55.002 --> 01:12:57.555
-l wish you'd stayed in there.
-That's right.

01:12:58.427 --> 01:13:01.842
Would you mind shutting that off,
or at least turning it down?

01:13:04.795 --> 01:13:06.006
Give it to me.

01:13:07.611 --> 01:13:10.328
That's right, put it where we can find it.

01:13:13.083 --> 01:13:14.839
-Here, you can't do that.
-What?

01:13:14.907 --> 01:13:16.762
-Shut that thing off.
-What?

01:13:18.011 --> 01:13:20.728
lt's against the law.
Besides, you'll wake everyone up.

01:13:20.795 --> 01:13:21.875
What?

01:13:21.979 --> 01:13:25.111
He says we'll wake up....

01:13:26.363 --> 01:13:28.218
Why don't you help me?

01:13:51.483 --> 01:13:54.647
-lt's beautiful up here, don't you think so?
-Sure, it's swell.

01:13:54.715 --> 01:13:56.952
lf it wasn't for you, l'd have missed all this.

01:13:57.050 --> 01:13:57.978
That's right.

01:13:58.043 --> 01:13:59.953
l suppose by the time l get to town...

01:14:00.059 --> 01:14:02.448
it will hardly be worthwhile going to bed.

01:14:02.523 --> 01:14:04.465
You mind if l use your car to go home?

01:14:04.571 --> 01:14:06.993
No, l don't mind,
only l think it's awfully silly.

01:14:07.099 --> 01:14:08.757
Patsy will be disappointed.

01:14:08.859 --> 01:14:10.801
Well, thanks. l'll go home.

01:14:10.907 --> 01:14:13.809
lt's all right with me.
My goodness, l just thought....

01:14:13.883 --> 01:14:16.272
Yes, you just thought
that if l'd stay up there...

01:14:16.379 --> 01:14:20.535
you'd show me exactly how innocent
a night in the country can be, didn't you?

01:14:22.043 --> 01:14:24.912
Are you still harping
on that same old string?

01:14:25.019 --> 01:14:27.702
lt doesn't matter to me
whether you go or stay.

01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:30.836
l was just trying
to make it easier for you, that's all.

01:14:40.187 --> 01:14:42.097
Did you have to throw that gadget away?

01:14:42.170 --> 01:14:44.537
You want me to go back and look for it?

01:14:44.955 --> 01:14:46.929
What else can happen to us?

01:14:47.899 --> 01:14:48.793
A lot.

01:14:51.611 --> 01:14:53.521
-What's that?
-Two motorcycles.

01:14:53.946 --> 01:14:56.335
-Anybody riding them?
-There are two men.

01:14:56.507 --> 01:14:58.547
-Are they in uniform?
-Yes.

01:15:00.795 --> 01:15:01.907
Fine.

01:15:14.458 --> 01:15:16.346
-Turn down that radio.
-l can't.

01:15:16.443 --> 01:15:18.515
What do you mean you can't?

01:15:18.587 --> 01:15:21.173
You lost the control?
You can't let it run that way!

01:15:21.275 --> 01:15:24.821
-Let me take a look at it.
-Wait a minute, l'll get out of your way.

01:15:24.923 --> 01:15:26.384
See what you can do.

01:15:27.387 --> 01:15:30.387
-Help me to sort the wiring.
-Let's take a look at it.

01:15:36.123 --> 01:15:37.367
Don't!

01:15:40.571 --> 01:15:41.913
lt's always good.

01:15:42.650 --> 01:15:45.106
Do you know you can get a ticket for that?

01:15:45.243 --> 01:15:46.650
-ls this your car?
-Nope!

01:15:46.715 --> 01:15:49.136
-Whose car is it?
-l'll give you one more guess.

01:15:49.243 --> 01:15:51.348
So it's yours. Where's your ownership card?

01:15:51.451 --> 01:15:54.833
-ln my bureau's upper right-hand drawer.
-Are you sure this is your car?

01:15:54.939 --> 01:15:56.433
Of course l'm sure!

01:15:56.539 --> 01:15:59.954
lf it's your car, what's the license number?
What is it?

01:16:00.059 --> 01:16:02.393
l don't know. They change it every year.

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:05.720
Don't look now,
but what's the number on your motorcycle?

01:16:07.291 --> 01:16:10.674
-Have you folks been drinking?
-No, l haven't, but....

01:16:11.163 --> 01:16:13.813
-Let me see you walk this line.
-Come on.

01:16:15.611 --> 01:16:17.498
Go on, honey, truck it!

01:16:34.107 --> 01:16:36.976
-Now what have you done?
-The brakes are bad.

01:16:37.083 --> 01:16:40.694
lt's a bad break for us, too.
Now we haven't any transportation.

01:16:40.795 --> 01:16:44.657
Could you two gentlemen take us
to my aunt's cabin? lt's only 15 miles.

01:16:44.731 --> 01:16:47.993
-That is, if you've nothing else to do.
-No, l don't.

01:16:48.059 --> 01:16:49.269
-Have you?
-Oh, no.

01:16:49.339 --> 01:16:50.801
Oh, that's fine.

01:16:52.251 --> 01:16:53.495
Where will you sit?

01:16:53.594 --> 01:16:56.245
l'll have to figure that one out, l guess.

01:17:36.731 --> 01:17:38.836
Come on, try it. lt's fun!

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:02.545
Now, listen, you two.
Don't say a word to this guy.

01:18:03.643 --> 01:18:05.236
Who are these people?

01:18:05.338 --> 01:18:07.793
Why, that's Mrs. Warriner
and that's Mr. Warriner.

01:18:07.899 --> 01:18:09.590
How do you do?

01:18:11.098 --> 01:18:12.113
Hello.

01:18:12.218 --> 01:18:16.080
l guess that settles it.
Will you get my car out in the morning?

01:18:16.154 --> 01:18:20.213
ln the meantime, think of something
you'd like for Christmas. Goodbye.

01:18:20.827 --> 01:18:23.696
-l hope you have a nice trip back.
-Thank you.

01:18:23.771 --> 01:18:24.753
Hi, Dad.

01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:26.481
Hello, Dad.

01:18:26.587 --> 01:18:28.114
Everything all right with you?

01:18:28.219 --> 01:18:30.674
-Oh, l'm feeling fine.
-That's good.

01:18:31.739 --> 01:18:34.008
But l wasn't expecting nobody tonight.

01:18:34.107 --> 01:18:35.536
lsn't Aunt Patsy here?

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:37.683
-Well, no.
-She isn't here?

01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:40.719
-But l thought for sure she was here.
-l didn't.

01:18:40.891 --> 01:18:42.451
lsn't that funny?

01:18:42.522 --> 01:18:44.213
Let me get you some coffee.

01:18:44.283 --> 01:18:46.585
Oh, no, l don't think so, Dad.

01:18:46.651 --> 01:18:50.263
lt might keep me awake.
l'm going right to bed. l'm awfully tired.

01:18:52.859 --> 01:18:54.266
See? She's all in.

01:18:54.331 --> 01:18:56.884
-Oh, Dad, is this room in order?
-Yes.

01:18:56.986 --> 01:18:59.255
That's fine. Mr. Warriner will sleep in there.

01:18:59.354 --> 01:19:02.769
Give him a couple of nice warm blankets.
He has a bad cold.

01:19:02.875 --> 01:19:03.890
ls that right?

01:19:03.995 --> 01:19:06.646
l've had a bad cold now
for some considerable time.

01:19:06.747 --> 01:19:09.136
-That's too bad.
-About three months.

01:19:11.034 --> 01:19:11.482
How are you doing in there?

01:19:11.482 --> 01:19:12.464
How are you doing in there?

01:19:12.538 --> 01:19:14.742
l'm having a little wardrobe trouble.

01:19:14.843 --> 01:19:16.119
You should see me.

01:19:16.186 --> 01:19:18.903
l'm glad you told him l have a cold.
He fixed me up good.

01:19:19.002 --> 01:19:22.385
My nightie is coming to me
through the courtesy of Aunt Patsy.

01:19:28.443 --> 01:19:30.036
Go, get off!

01:19:57.883 --> 01:19:59.289
Air-conditioned.

01:20:01.979 --> 01:20:04.400
-What's wrong with this?
-l don't know.

01:20:08.282 --> 01:20:10.617
The lock isn't very practical, is it?

01:20:12.283 --> 01:20:14.137
No, it's not so very practical....

01:20:14.715 --> 01:20:16.853
l guess it will serve its purpose.

01:20:20.795 --> 01:20:23.129
Well, good night.

01:20:24.763 --> 01:20:26.006
Good night.

01:20:48.987 --> 01:20:51.736
l'm afraid we're going to have trouble
with this.

01:20:51.803 --> 01:20:53.843
l guess l'll be all right.

01:20:58.011 --> 01:20:59.953
-Good night.
-Good night.

01:21:02.298 --> 01:21:03.443
Good night.

01:22:04.954 --> 01:22:06.896
l told you we'd have trouble with this.

01:22:07.002 --> 01:22:08.180
Yes.

01:22:15.579 --> 01:22:18.513
ln a half an hour,
we'll no longer be Mr. and Mrs.

01:22:19.898 --> 01:22:21.240
Funny, isn't it?

01:22:21.722 --> 01:22:25.781
Yes, it's funny that everything
is the way it is, on account of how you feel.

01:22:26.747 --> 01:22:31.122
l mean, if you didn't feel how you do,
things wouldn't be as they are, would they?

01:22:32.122 --> 01:22:35.635
l mean, things could be the same
if things were different.

01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:40.148
-But things are the way you made them.
-Oh, no.

01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:43.960
Things are the way you think l made them.
l didn't make them that way at all.

01:22:44.027 --> 01:22:46.677
Things are just the same
as they always were...

01:22:46.874 --> 01:22:49.296
only you're the same as you were, too...

01:22:49.595 --> 01:22:52.726
so l guess things
will never be the same again.

01:23:00.314 --> 01:23:01.688
Good night.

01:23:11.322 --> 01:23:13.427
-Got caught in the door.
-Good night.

01:23:13.754 --> 01:23:14.866
Good night.

01:24:42.554 --> 01:24:44.115
Why, you....

01:24:51.066 --> 01:24:53.041
l was trying to stop it.

01:24:54.170 --> 01:24:55.861
Well, there it goes again.

01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:14.549
You're all confused, aren't you?

01:25:16.219 --> 01:25:17.812
-Aren't you?
-No.

01:25:18.042 --> 01:25:20.693
You should be. You're wrong
about things being different...

01:25:20.763 --> 01:25:22.770
because they're not the same.

01:25:22.842 --> 01:25:25.657
Things are different,
except in a different way.

01:25:25.722 --> 01:25:28.340
You're still the same, only l've been a fool.

01:25:28.699 --> 01:25:30.008
But l'm not now.

01:25:30.746 --> 01:25:32.983
As long as l'm different, don't you think...

01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:35.090
maybe things could be the same again...

01:25:35.163 --> 01:25:36.821
only a little different?

01:25:37.242 --> 01:25:38.769
You mean that, Jerry?

01:25:39.611 --> 01:25:40.920
Are you sure?

01:25:41.242 --> 01:25:44.504
No more doubts? No more being....

01:25:47.226 --> 01:25:49.168
-Except....
-Except what?

01:25:49.690 --> 01:25:52.560
-There's only one thing that bothers me.
-What?

01:25:54.971 --> 01:25:56.497
This darn lock.

01:25:59.290 --> 01:26:00.468
ls that all?

01:26:06.714 --> 01:26:08.885
You think maybe if you....

01:26:28.282 --> 01:26:29.624
Good night.
