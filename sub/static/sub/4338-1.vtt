01:14.600 --> 01:18.100
But we don't have a fishtank.

01:18.100 --> 01:19.600
- We could get one.
- Oh, mister.

01:23.300 --> 01:26.800
Mom, will you still be a science teacher
when I get into high school?

01:26.800 --> 01:29.500
Hmm...
you never know.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.500
Why?

01:31.600 --> 01:34.600
'Cause I think it'd be kind of weird to
have your mom as a teacher.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.500
Ah!

01:37.600 --> 01:40.500
I don't. I don't think so.
I think...

01:40.500 --> 01:42.500
it might be
kind of neat.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.800
Why?

01:44.900 --> 01:49.100
Because then I'd get to hug and kiss you
anytime I wanted to.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.100
Mom, that is gross.

01:51.100 --> 01:54.200
Get out of here.

01:54.200 --> 01:57.400
You have soccer, 1:45.
I'll pick you up.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.600
Okay, Mom.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.500
Mom!

02:55.000 --> 02:56.700
Morning, Rosario.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.700
- Buenos dias, Miss Jessica.
- Como esta?

02:58.800 --> 03:00.400
Ay, bien, bien.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.400
Miss Jessica, you had a phone call when
you were in the shower.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.900
I think they left you
a message.

03:04.900 --> 03:07.500
Okay.

03:07.600 --> 03:08.800
Don't move!

03:08.900 --> 03:10.700
Don't touch that alarm!

03:14.000 --> 03:17.900
Search the house.
Put her in the van.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.000
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.200
I'm videotaping hot chicks
walking in their bikinis.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.400
Man, this is the greatest
cell phone ever made.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.700
It is, I'm not kidding.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.600
Hey, I draw you.
I draw you, $5.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.600
- No, no, no, no tengo dinero, gracias.
- Let me get the phone.

06:26.700 --> 06:29.100
Hold on a second. I'm e-mailing this
video to my computer.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.100
It's gonna be
my new screen-saver.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.600
- Here you go.
- It's Chloe.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.200
No, dude, don't do this.
Don't do this.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.200
- I'm just gonna say hi.
- You're not gonna say hi.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.800
- No hi? I can't say hi?
- No hi. Come on, man.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.600
Hold it together. This girl... she dumped
you, all right?

06:43.600 --> 06:46.100
Have some self-respect.
Have some dignity.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.500
- You're right.
- Be strong.

06:47.500 --> 06:50.100
- You're right, thank you.
- Yeah, all right.

06:50.100 --> 06:52.400
Oh, what's
going on, ladies?

06:54.500 --> 06:57.500
What... what are you...
bro?

06:57.500 --> 06:58.900
Like I'm talking to myself.

06:58.900 --> 07:00.900
Chloe!

07:01.900 --> 07:04.100
- Hey!
- Ryan.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.500
- Hello, Chad.
- Chloe.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.500
- Sam.
- Hey.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.700
Friend with nipples.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.500
Hey, so I called you
the other night.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.900
I know, Tara told me.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.700
Why didn't you
call me back?

07:14.700 --> 07:16.800
Let's chat over here.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.900
- Okay.
- Good luck, man.

07:23.200 --> 07:27.500
Okay, Ryan, I really want you
to hear this, okay?

07:27.500 --> 07:30.100
We're not
getting back together.

07:30.100 --> 07:32.100
What, you mean
like today?

07:32.200 --> 07:33.800
'Cause that's fine.
I have time.

07:35.900 --> 07:38.300
This is just some
big joke to you, isn't it?

07:38.300 --> 07:39.800
No, it's not,
it's not.

07:39.900 --> 07:41.400
Yes, yes,
you know, see...

07:41.500 --> 07:44.900
this is exactly why I broke up with you
in the first place.

07:44.900 --> 07:48.400
You are irresponsible,
self-centered,

07:48.400 --> 07:51.200
completely childish.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.000
And, look,
I need to move on.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
All right, okay, wait, wait, wait.
I know I used to be that way.

07:55.100 --> 07:59.700
I used to be all those
things, but not anymore.

07:59.700 --> 08:01.700
I'm serious, Chloe,
ever since you dumped me,

08:01.700 --> 08:04.100
I've been thinking
about my life...

08:04.100 --> 08:06.200
and I've changed.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.300
- Sure you have.
- I have.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.300
I came down here
to volunteer.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.700
For what?

08:13.700 --> 08:16.600
For what... for the...
the "Heal The Day. "

08:16.700 --> 08:18.100
Watch your back.

08:18.100 --> 08:19.800
"Heal the bay?"

08:19.900 --> 08:21.700
Yes, that's what I said.

08:21.700 --> 08:24.800
That's bullshit.

08:24.900 --> 08:28.400
Give me something... give me something
to do. I'll prove it to you.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.900
Okay then,

08:31.000 --> 08:34.700
Here. These flyers need to be handed
out before the concert tonight.

08:34.700 --> 08:38.000
- Okay.
- Chloe, he can get the t-shirts.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.700
Right... there're four boxes
of T-shirts

08:40.700 --> 08:42.900
that need to be picked up
from the Office Depot.

08:42.900 --> 08:45.400
Okay, that's not
a problem.

08:45.400 --> 08:49.100
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:49.100 --> 08:51.800
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.000
Shit!

08:57.000 --> 09:00.800
I'm just a big fan of, you know...
elastic. I think it's awesome.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.400
Ah, dude,
that sucks.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.400
No, that sucks more.
I'm not doing this.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.500
- Please, Chad. It'll take 10 minutes.
- No! Dude, no.

09:07.500 --> 09:11.200
You get to hang out with her friend with
the nipples. I think she liked you.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.700
You're a god,
thank you.

09:13.700 --> 09:16.600
It's awesome.
See you later, man.

09:18.600 --> 09:23.300
Ah, so it's chilly
out here, huh?

09:23.300 --> 09:25.300
No, not really.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.000
I beg to differ.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.900
Hello? Hello?

09:54.900 --> 09:57.800
If you'd like to make a call...
- Shit!

10:13.500 --> 10:15.400
# My baby loves me #

10:15.500 --> 10:18.000
# And I'm running away #

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
# Running away #

10:21.000 --> 10:22.600
# I've been
thinking lately #

10:22.700 --> 10:25.500
# About the things
I've done so wrong... #

10:27.700 --> 10:29.700
Hello, gorgeous.

10:29.800 --> 10:33.500
See, this is exactly why I broke up
with you in the first place.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.500
You are irresponsible,

10:35.600 --> 10:38.600
completely childish...

10:41.300 --> 10:42.400
Hello.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.600
Hello, hello!

10:44.700 --> 10:46.400
Hello, thank God!

10:46.500 --> 10:47.700
Who is this? Chloe?

10:47.700 --> 10:51.500
My name is Jessica Martin.
I need your help.

10:51.600 --> 10:55.300
I've been kidnapped. L... I need you
to go to the police.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.700
Kidnapped, huh?

10:56.700 --> 10:59.500
This is for real.
I... I don't know where I am.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.800
I... I'm locked up
in an attic somewhere.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.100
I... I think they're going
to kill me.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.100
Nice kidnappers
to give you a phone.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.500
They... they didn't give me
a phone, no.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.800
Th... there was a...

11:12.800 --> 11:15.900
Right, I think if you were in trouble,
you would've called the cops and not me.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.800
Now, I got another
call, okay?

11:17.800 --> 11:20.500
Please, just listen.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.900
The phone I'm on
is shattered.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.800
I've been clicking wires
together forever

11:27.900 --> 11:30.400
trying to reach
someone, anyone.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.400
Please,
just don't hang up.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.400
I may not get anyone else.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.100
Right, later.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.500
- Hello?
- I have no idea what just happened.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.800
One minute I'm talking
to nipples, next thing you know,

11:41.800 --> 11:43.800
I'm wearing a whale costume
handing out flyers.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.600
That sucks.
Sounds like she got you.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.700
I mean, I'm not saying
it doesn't have its benefits.

11:50.700 --> 11:53.900
Hey, you guys know that a blue whale's
got an 11-foot penis?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.700
- Heal the bay.
- Really?

11:55.700 --> 11:57.200
I gotta to go.
I'll see you later.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.300
All right,
later, bud.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.000
Can you hear me?

12:03.100 --> 12:06.000
You're still there, huh?
You know, this has been really fun.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.200
But now you're wasting
my minutes. I'm gonna go.

12:08.300 --> 12:11.800
They're going to kill me.

12:11.800 --> 12:15.200
You're my only hope.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.600
Nice with the fake tears,
lady.

12:18.700 --> 12:22.200
- What's your name?
- What?

12:22.200 --> 12:24.200
Please, tell me your name.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.200
Ryan.

12:26.200 --> 12:29.100
Ryan...

12:29.200 --> 12:32.100
I don't know who you are.
I don't know you at all.

12:32.100 --> 12:35.300
But I can't believe
that you would be so selfish

12:35.300 --> 12:37.700
that you wouldn't take
10 minutes out of your day

12:37.800 --> 12:40.700
to hand your phone
to a police officer.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.600
Just 10 minutes.

12:43.600 --> 12:47.700
Okay, 10 minutes.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.500
Hold on.
Hold on a second.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.300
Shut up, okay?
Now listen to me.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.800
I'm a cop and have been
for 27 years.

12:57.800 --> 13:01.500
So let's just cut the bullshit, pal,
because I've heard it all.

13:01.500 --> 13:04.400
Now, I ordered the "Rain Shower"
with awapuhi.

13:04.400 --> 13:08.400
Don't tell me jojoba is awapuhi.
I wasn't born yesterday.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.900
So I'm gonna return the two cases and
you will refund my money.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.700
Or maybe... maybe I should
just drive down there

13:14.700 --> 13:17.000
and we can discuss this
in person.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.900
No, no, no, I've got loofahs
up my ass.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.600
What I want is a refund.

13:22.600 --> 13:25.000
Thank you.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.800
Thank you,
I appreciate that.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.800
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.600
Hey, Mooney, I thought
the captain told you

13:32.700 --> 13:35.000
you're not supposed
to have this shit sent here anymore.

13:35.100 --> 13:38.600
I ordered this a long time ago, before
he ever told me that.

13:38.600 --> 13:42.600
Sea sponges from
the coast of France.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.900
Sea sponges?
Your husband like that sort of stuff?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.300
Hey, lay off him,
all right?

13:46.300 --> 13:48.500
At least he's got a plan.
What does your future hold

13:48.600 --> 13:50.200
besides bowling nights
and a beer belly?

13:50.300 --> 13:52.600
- Hey, this is Kevlar, pal.
- Yeah, have another doughnut.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.300
Asshole.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.300
- Thanks, Jack.
- Yeah, forget about it.

14:04.900 --> 14:06.900
You sure about this
beauty parlor thing?

14:06.900 --> 14:09.900
Day spa. It's a day spa.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
And no, I'm not sure
about shit.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.200
You know, you could
always come work for me.

14:14.300 --> 14:16.200
I could use you
on the task force, really, could.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.700
Thanks, Jack.
I appreciate that.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.600
But I made a deal
with Mare.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.500
And it's not just that.
I'm bored.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.400
27 years... it's enough.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.500
Okay.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.400
- What?
- No, nothing.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.500
What? Come on,
say it.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.300
You're pussy-whipped, Bob.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.100
I mean, she's got you wrapped around
her little finger like a toy.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.300
No, I... look,

14:43.400 --> 14:45.900
If this thing takes off,
we can make a shitload of money.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.900
And then we'll see
who's laughing.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.600
All right, I hope so.

14:51.700 --> 14:54.600
Here is our top story
this hour.

14:54.700 --> 14:56.900
Breaking news
coming out of Culver City:

14:57.000 --> 15:00.900
The bodies of two men have been
discovered outside a local warehouse

15:00.900 --> 15:05.500
shot execution-style in what appears
to be yet another gangland slam.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.700
These murders are the latest episode
in what has been dubbed

15:08.700 --> 15:13.100
a gang war over Los Angeles'
illegal street-drug trade.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.900
All right, I'm at the police station.
I'm running inside.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.500
- I'll give them the phone.
- Thank you so much.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.800
Excuse me, Officer.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.900
Hold on a second,
you've got the wrong form.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.400
What? Crap, I thought
I'd grabbed an 18-9.

15:40.500 --> 15:43.500
Hey, listen, I got some lady on the
phone who says she's been kidnapped.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.000
Will you talk to her?

15:47.900 --> 15:51.800
- Thank you.
- Sergeant Mooney.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.300
Y- yes, yes, Officer,

15:54.400 --> 15:56.600
m- my name is Jessica,

15:56.700 --> 15:58.700
Jessica Martin.

15:58.700 --> 16:02.100
I've been kidnapped. L...
I have a home in Brentwood.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.100
This morning, five men

16:04.100 --> 16:06.600
broke into my home
and killed my housekeeper.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.200
You got something to say
to me, puto bitch?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.600
Oh brother.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.900
Hey, hey! Break it up.

16:14.900 --> 16:17.400
Take this upstairs
to robbery-homicide, fourth floor.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.700
Wait, wait,
where am I going?

16:18.700 --> 16:21.200
The fourth floor,
upstairs, now, go!

16:27.200 --> 16:29.400
Give us a hand.
Hey, Rudy, come on.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.400
Excuse me, are you
a detective?

16:31.400 --> 16:33.500
Detective?
I'm a freaking victim here.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.700
Detective? Those jerks
dragged me down here.

16:35.700 --> 16:37.500
And they're supposed
to read me my rights.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.000
And they... hey, where are you going,
you little punk?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.300
Ryan!

16:41.300 --> 16:43.700
Oh my God!

16:43.700 --> 16:46.200
What? What is it?
What's going on?

17:04.500 --> 17:07.099
What?

17:10.599 --> 17:13.300
What? What?

17:13.400 --> 17:15.800
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

17:15.900 --> 17:18.200
No, oh, God! No!

17:18.200 --> 17:22.400
Oh, God!

17:22.400 --> 17:25.000
Where did he put it?

17:25.099 --> 17:27.300
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Holy shit!

17:27.300 --> 17:29.900
- What are you talking...?
- Where is your husband?

17:29.900 --> 17:32.200
Where is he?

17:32.200 --> 17:33.900
I...

17:33.900 --> 17:35.500
Oh, God...

17:35.600 --> 17:38.400
Tell me what
I need to know.

17:38.500 --> 17:42.500
Don't, please! Don't.

17:51.200 --> 17:55.200
You have
a little boy, right?

17:55.200 --> 17:57.300
He goes to the Wyman School

17:57.400 --> 17:59.400
- In Westwood?
- No, no.

18:00.900 --> 18:03.300
No! What do you want
with him?

18:03.300 --> 18:06.000
No! What do you
want with him?

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
You've got the wrong family!
You've got the wrong family!

18:11.000 --> 18:13.500
Please, God! No!

18:13.500 --> 18:15.200
Oh my God!

18:17.000 --> 18:20.200
...and the victims have been
escorted to Culver City...

18:20.200 --> 18:22.100
We need to end
this thing now.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.900
Deason, Dimitri,
go get the kid.

18:27.900 --> 18:31.000
Ryan, Ryan?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.700
I know, I'm going
to get help.

18:32.700 --> 18:36.300
What's going on there?

18:36.300 --> 18:38.800
It's just static. I'm running upstairs
to find a detective.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.600
Hang on a second.
I might lose you, okay?

18:40.600 --> 18:42.500
No, you can't lose me.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.300
I know. We're almost there.
Don't worry.

18:44.300 --> 18:48.300
No, Ryan, stop,
you can't loose me or I'm dead.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.800
What do you want me to do?
I'm standing in the stairwell.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.600
I mean, I can...
I can see the door.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.200
Oh, shit!

19:02.200 --> 19:04.200
Is anybody there?

19:04.200 --> 19:07.000
I need a detective, please,
this is an emergency!

19:07.000 --> 19:11.400
Anybody!

19:19.900 --> 19:22.400
Oh my God!

19:28.200 --> 19:30.800
Ryan, what time is it?

19:30.800 --> 19:34.100
It's 1:30.
Is anyone there?

19:34.100 --> 19:37.900
Listen to me. My son's school
gets out at 1:45.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.200
They have my car.
He'll hop in the car. You have to...

19:40.300 --> 19:42.800
Look, I'm trying, I can't move.
What do you...

19:42.800 --> 19:46.000
the Wyman School.
Barrington and Sunset.

19:46.100 --> 19:50.200
- 1:45, Ryan, hurry!
- Shit!

19:53.000 --> 19:55.400
Where are you?

19:55.400 --> 19:57.400
I just turned off Sunset.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.400
Okay, it's on your right.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.200
About, uh... two miles
up the road.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.200
What do these guys
want anyway?

20:04.300 --> 20:07.500
I don't know.
I'm a science biology teacher.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.200
What about your husband?
Is he rich?

20:09.300 --> 20:12.600
No, no, he's a realtor.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.900
None of this
makes any sense.

20:20.900 --> 20:22.900
Yo, Grandma, come on!

20:23.000 --> 20:23.900
What is it?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.500
Where is a cop
when you need one?

20:29.300 --> 20:31.800
What is this?

20:35.700 --> 20:37.700
Hey, hey!

20:37.700 --> 20:40.400
Get off your cell phone.
Concentrate on the road.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.900
- Yeah, yeah...
- Idiot! You still there?

20:42.900 --> 20:45.300
- Oh, Ryan, hurry.
- Okay, all right.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.400
All right,
I see the school.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.700
- Ryan?
- Yeah.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.400
How much time do we have?

21:06.500 --> 21:08.600
Uh... we got one minute.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.000
Okay, go up
to the main building.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.800
His classroom will be
on... on the left.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.800
Okay.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.000
- All right, I'm here.
- Okay.

21:24.100 --> 21:25.500
- What's your kid's name?
- Ricky.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.500
- Ricky what?
- Martin.

21:27.500 --> 21:30.500
Ricky Martin? You named your child
Ricky Martin?

21:30.600 --> 21:32.300
It was before the singer...

21:32.400 --> 21:33.900
Whatever, whatever.
What does he look like?

21:34.000 --> 21:35.600
He's 11 years old,

21:35.700 --> 21:40.000
blond hair, he's really s...
uh... small for his age,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.300
gree... green eyes,
he's got on a...

21:42.400 --> 21:44.800
a bl... blue shirt
and khaki pants.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.200
They're all wearing that.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.200
- Hey, are you Ricky Martin?
- No.

21:49.200 --> 21:52.200
- Sir, can I help you?
- Ricky Martin?

21:52.200 --> 21:56.200
Go to the office.
Hand them the phone.

21:56.200 --> 21:58.700
I'll tell them
what happened.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.400
Excuse me,
what are you doing?

22:03.500 --> 22:05.800
Hey, do you know where I can find
the administrations office?

22:05.800 --> 22:07.500
Yeah, it's up two...

22:07.500 --> 22:09.300
You can't go there
right now, sir, it's closed.

22:09.300 --> 22:11.200
- Oh, shit!
- You can't go in there, sir, sir?

22:11.300 --> 22:12.500
Ricky Martin!

22:12.500 --> 22:15.100
- Was that the bell?
- Yes, yes it was.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.400
- Ricky Martin!
- Hurry!

22:16.500 --> 22:18.700
Hurry, he'll go
to the parents' pickup spot.

22:18.700 --> 22:21.000
- Okay, okay.
- Hey!

22:25.100 --> 22:28.800
Oh, God! Ryan?
Ryan, they're gonna get him.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.300
All right, parent pickup,
I see it.

22:30.300 --> 22:32.100
- He'll definitely go there?
- Yes.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.900
What kind of car you got?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
A... a black SUV.

22:36.100 --> 22:38.400
Of course you do.

22:42.300 --> 22:44.100
Excuse me, sir,
you cannot be up here.

22:44.100 --> 22:46.200
You've got to be down there
with the other parents.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.200
I know, I'm looking for a kid named
Ricky Martin. I think he's in trouble.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.500
He'll have a "Lord Of The Rings"
backpack.

22:56.300 --> 22:57.500
Ryan, did you hear me?

22:59.500 --> 23:02.600
Ricky Martin!

23:02.600 --> 23:04.800
Holy shit, you see that?
The kid just got kidnapped.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.300
What?!

23:08.400 --> 23:11.100
- I'm sorry. I gotta borrow your car.
- No, sir! Hey!

23:11.200 --> 23:14.000
Hey! Don, I need
some help here.

23:14.100 --> 23:17.400
Hey! Hey! Hey!

23:18.400 --> 23:19.900
Ryan, are you there?

23:19.900 --> 23:21.600
Yeah, Jessica, I'm here.

23:30.300 --> 23:31.800
Don't let them get away.

23:31.900 --> 23:33.600
It's okay, it's okay.
I can still see them up ahead.

23:38.100 --> 23:40.200
It's gonna be okay. I can
see them, all right, Jessica?

23:40.300 --> 23:42.300
You know what? This isn't a bad thing.
I can actually follow them

23:42.300 --> 23:44.300
to where they're holding you
and I can call the cops.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.600
- Shit!
- What?

23:52.700 --> 23:54.700
This bus just cut me off.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.100
Come on!

24:03.600 --> 24:05.900
All right, this isn't working.
Hang on.

24:17.300 --> 24:18.900
Son...

24:19.000 --> 24:21.500
Holy...

24:25.000 --> 24:27.800
Whoa!

24:31.900 --> 24:34.000
Whoa, whoa.

24:42.900 --> 24:45.500
Holy shit!

24:51.700 --> 24:54.100
Oh! Oh!

24:56.900 --> 25:00.200
- A-are you okay?
- We're okay.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.200
We're alive.
We're breathing.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.700
What happened?
Did you loose them?

25:03.700 --> 25:05.600
Don't worry,
I'll find them.

25:12.400 --> 25:13.700
Shit!

25:13.800 --> 25:15.200
What?

25:15.200 --> 25:17.400
Little bit of traffic.
Just give me a second, okay?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.400
Come on, man,
let us through.

25:24.200 --> 25:27.000
- Shit! My battery's dying.
- Do you have a charger?

25:27.000 --> 25:29.200
Yeah, at my house, Jessica.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.500
Hang on,
I'm checking the car.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.100
Now you wanna move?

25:32.200 --> 25:34.700
Shit.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.600
Whoa!

25:38.000 --> 25:40.800
- Did you... did you find it?
- Not exactly.

25:45.300 --> 25:47.900
Hey, what's the holdup?
Come on.

26:02.100 --> 26:04.900
You are gonna owe me
so big for this.

26:19.100 --> 26:21.300
Get the rig out!

26:30.800 --> 26:33.200
Shit!

26:48.700 --> 26:51.100
You still there?
Can you hear me?

26:51.100 --> 26:53.300
- I'm here.
- All right.

26:53.300 --> 26:55.600
We're getting us
a charger.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.100
- Sorry, excuse me, I'm sorry.
- Hey!

27:00.100 --> 27:02.700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
excuse me, I'm sorry.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.300
Excuse me, excuse me!

27:04.400 --> 27:06.300
- Hey, there's a line.
- I know, I'm sorry.

27:06.300 --> 27:07.800
Excuse me,
I need a charger.

27:07.900 --> 27:10.200
Sir, you need
to wait your turn, okay.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.300
And we're having a special today
on cheetah spots.

27:12.300 --> 27:14.800
- If you're feeling fierce.
- Ooh, how fun.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.700
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, sir.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.300
- Just a second...
- I'm with a customer.

27:18.300 --> 27:21.300
If you'll just take a number, somebody
will be with you shortly.

27:21.300 --> 27:23.000
We also have this one here.

27:23.100 --> 27:26.300
Hey, hey, listen, I've got a
life-and-death call on this phone.

27:26.300 --> 27:28.200
My battery is about to die.
You have a charger?

27:28.300 --> 27:30.100
Sure, yeah, why don't you
take a number, okay?

27:30.100 --> 27:31.700
And one of our sales
associates will help you

27:31.700 --> 27:33.300
when your turn
comes around, excuse me.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.900
No, no, my battery's
gonna die.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.300
Excuse me, miss, please,
I have an emergency.

27:37.300 --> 27:39.700
Sorry, sweetie, I'm
on break. Take a number.

27:39.700 --> 27:42.000
No, I don't want
to take a number.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.100
Come on,
this is ridiculous.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Screw this.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.800
Oh, my god!

28:11.100 --> 28:14.500
Now who's gonna give me
that goddamn charger?

28:17.000 --> 28:20.600
- Dude, here's your charger.
- Thank you.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.400
- Hey, Jack?
- Hey, Bob.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.600
I sent a kid up
to see you guys this morning.

28:26.700 --> 28:28.400
He had a phone with him,
some woman on the other end.

28:28.400 --> 28:30.600
An abduction, something
like that... you do anything with that?

28:30.600 --> 28:32.300
You know, I've been stuck
down at City Hall all morning

28:32.400 --> 28:34.200
doing press on these
gang killings,

28:34.200 --> 28:36.000
- But, uh, I'll ask around for you.
- Would you?

28:36.000 --> 28:37.700
- Sure. All right.
- Thanks.

28:37.700 --> 28:41.300
Hey, Bob, you know,
I was thinking about it.

28:41.300 --> 28:44.400
You and Mare,
you'll do great with that beauty parlor.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.400
It's a day spa.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.900
Aw, shit.

29:34.100 --> 29:36.500
Jess, are you there?
Pick up. Jessica!

29:36.600 --> 29:38.600
Honey, listen to me,
you have to get out of the house

29:38.700 --> 29:42.000
as fast as you can. Something's
happened. There's no time to explain.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.900
Just get Ricky and meet me at our place
in left field, honey. I love you.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.600
I'll explain
to you later, now go.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.700
All right, we're good.
We got a charger.

29:52.800 --> 29:55.200
Oh my God!

30:17.200 --> 30:18.900
Do you want to die here?

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Oh, shit!

30:22.300 --> 30:24.900
No, please.

30:24.900 --> 30:28.100
My family hasn't done
anything to you.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.400
Your husband left a message
asking you to meet him in left field.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.300
Where is that?

30:35.300 --> 30:39.800
What? L... I don't know.

30:39.800 --> 30:42.900
I don't know.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.400
Go to the window.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.700
There's something
I want you to see.

31:06.900 --> 31:08.900
Dimitri, bring him out.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.600
You got three seconds
to tell me where left field is,

31:38.600 --> 31:40.800
or you're never gonna see
your son again.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.300
Oh, God. Oh, God!

31:45.300 --> 31:47.800
One...

31:52.300 --> 31:54.400
...two...

31:56.300 --> 31:59.600
He's a baby, you bastard!
He's a baby!

31:59.600 --> 32:02.600
- Yeah, come on...
- He's a baby, he's a baby!

32:02.600 --> 32:04.000
What's the matter
with you, huh?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.600
He's a baby,
he's a baby!

32:08.700 --> 32:11.900
Yeah, you wanna play?
You wanna play?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.600
You wanna play
with me? Huh?

32:30.800 --> 32:32.200
Your time is up.

32:32.300 --> 32:35.000
Oh, God!
No, no, no, no, no.

32:35.100 --> 32:37.500
- Your son is dead.
- No, no, he's not.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.600
No, no, no, no, no!

32:41.700 --> 32:44.300
It's a bar.
It's a bar in LA.

32:46.600 --> 32:49.900
- What?
- It's a bar

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
at LAX.

32:55.300 --> 32:56.900
We got him.

32:56.900 --> 32:59.300
Put the kid in the garage.

33:01.300 --> 33:04.200
When I didn't show up
for work this morning

33:04.200 --> 33:06.500
someone called the police,
I'm sure.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.900
You better hope they didn't.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.300
You know...

33:23.300 --> 33:27.800
all I care about is the safety of my
son, that's all I care about. I will...

33:27.900 --> 33:29.800
- Shut up!
... cooperate with you. I will...

33:29.900 --> 33:32.100
- Shut up.
- L... I just...

33:32.100 --> 33:34.200
no, I just want
to tell you, I...

33:34.200 --> 33:36.800
Hey, hey, hey! Can you
turn that down?

33:36.800 --> 33:38.300
Can you turn that down,
please?

33:42.300 --> 33:44.400
- I just want you to know...
- Shut up.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.000
Shut up!

34:05.500 --> 34:07.200
Ethan, what the hell
are we doing, man?

34:07.300 --> 34:08.900
This is turning into
a bunch of bullshit.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.900
- Man, you gotta chill out.
- LAX, let's go!

34:15.199 --> 34:17.600
Jessica?

34:21.600 --> 34:24.000
Jessica, come on,
say something.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.300
I'm... I'm here.

34:26.300 --> 34:29.000
Ah. You knew where he was,
Jessica.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.900
If you know stuff,
you got to tell these guys.

34:30.900 --> 34:34.100
Don't you get it, Ryan?

34:34.100 --> 34:36.900
After they find Craig,

34:36.900 --> 34:38.900
we're all going to die.

34:38.900 --> 34:41.400
You don't know that.
Don't think that way.

34:41.400 --> 34:44.400
We've all seen their faces.
They can't let us live.

34:44.400 --> 34:48.199
I feel so helpless.

34:48.300 --> 34:51.500
It's my family.

35:28.400 --> 35:31.600
- Miss Martin?
- Yes?

35:31.600 --> 35:36.000
- Jessica Kate Martin?
- Yes, can I help you, Mister...?

35:36.100 --> 35:40.100
I'm sorry.
Officer Mooney.

35:40.100 --> 35:42.700
Ms. Martin, did you call
the police today?

35:42.800 --> 35:44.700
No.

35:44.800 --> 35:47.700
We had a report
of a possible kidnapping.

35:47.700 --> 35:50.800
You haven't been
kidnapped today, have you?

35:50.800 --> 35:52.200
No.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.900
I'm sorry
to have disturbed you then.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.400
Oh, no problem,
thank you, Officer.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
- Yeah?
- It's Bayback.

36:14.100 --> 36:16.500
- What is it?
- We had a visitor, a cop.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.600
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's taken care of.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.200
Good.

36:20.600 --> 36:24.600
Oh, God.
If they find Craig...

36:24.600 --> 36:27.400
Hey, listen to me.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.900
I'm gonna beat them
to the airport.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.700
Do you hear me?

36:32.800 --> 36:37.200
Yes, I hear you.

36:37.300 --> 36:39.900
- Okay.
- Thank you.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.700
Thank you
for doing all this.

36:46.100 --> 36:48.100
So what does that guy
look like,

36:48.100 --> 36:50.000
that guy you were
talking to?

36:50.100 --> 36:52.900
Um, uh...

36:52.900 --> 36:57.100
black jeans,
a brown leather jacket,

36:57.100 --> 37:00.100
close-cropped hair,
that's about it.

37:00.200 --> 37:02.200
What else, what else?
What was he driving?

37:02.200 --> 37:04.900
Just shut up.

37:04.900 --> 37:06.900
Wait, what?
Jessica, I can't hear you.

37:06.900 --> 37:08.900
- I'm sitting in it right now.
- Yeah?

37:09.000 --> 37:10.800
- Hello?
- It's a brand new Porsche Carrera.

37:10.900 --> 37:12.400
- The partners gave it to me.
- Great.

37:12.500 --> 37:16.100
Mm-hm, sugar.
Brand new, arctic blue convertible.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.900
It goes zero to 60
in 5.2 seconds.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.500
Takes the girls' panties down
in 3.5 seconds.

37:21.500 --> 37:24.900
- Jessica, you still there?
- Hey, this is a private call.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.500
No, I'm here.
But you're breaking up.

37:27.500 --> 37:30.200
Get off my line!
Mom, are you still there?

37:30.300 --> 37:32.200
Hey, hey, listen,
this woman needs help.

37:32.300 --> 37:34.000
Uh, actually no,
you're gonna need help

37:34.100 --> 37:35.900
uh, when you pull my subpoena
out of your asshole

37:35.900 --> 37:37.400
for not getting
off my line.

37:37.500 --> 37:39.500
Jessica, Jessica,
don't hang up.

37:39.600 --> 37:42.500
Can you hear me?
Whatever happens, don't hang up.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.500
- Honey?
- What? Yeah, hey, Jess,

37:44.600 --> 37:46.100
don't... don't hang up.

37:46.100 --> 37:49.100
Hey, just be yourself, Jess.
Just get off my line, man.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.000
- Jessica.
- Jessica! Jessica!

37:51.000 --> 37:53.500
- Jessica, can you hear me?
- Who's Jessica?

37:53.500 --> 37:54.600
Shit!

37:54.600 --> 37:58.600
Please,
please, listen to me.

37:58.600 --> 38:02.600
I've been kidnapped.
I don't know where I am.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.700
They murdered
my housekeeper.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.400
Wait, wait, wait,
stop, stop, stop, stop!

38:06.500 --> 38:09.600
Murdered your housekeeper?
That... that's really cute.

38:09.700 --> 38:11.700
Um, A) Shut up,

38:11.700 --> 38:14.300
B) You can't bullshit
a lawyer, baby girl,

38:14.400 --> 38:15.900
Do you get that?

38:16.000 --> 38:19.300
Okay? I get paid $600 an hour
to listen to shit like this.

38:19.300 --> 38:21.400
So you want me
to bill you?

38:21.500 --> 38:24.300
That's fine. Bill me anything you want.
Just help me.

38:24.400 --> 38:27.700
I will pay you...

38:42.600 --> 38:44.200
What the hell
is your problem, man?

38:44.200 --> 38:46.200
What the hell is your problem?
You want to tussle?

38:46.300 --> 38:48.800
- Give me your phone!
- Oh snaps.

38:48.800 --> 38:50.400
Give me your phone!

38:50.400 --> 38:52.500
Ryan? Is that you?

38:52.500 --> 38:53.700
Yeah, I'm here, Jessica.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.700
Hey, Jess,
your buddy's here.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.200
Look, give me your phone
or I shoot your car.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.700
Oh, hell no, hell no.

38:59.700 --> 39:02.200
Why would you want to do
something awful like that?

39:04.400 --> 39:06.200
Move!

39:11.900 --> 39:14.100
I'm really sorry about this.

39:14.100 --> 39:15.800
But I need your car.

39:15.900 --> 39:17.500
- Oh, come on, dude, I'm not...
- Look,

39:17.600 --> 39:20.100
- Okay. Yeah, that's fine.
- I need your car.

39:22.400 --> 39:23.900
Ryan, i-is that you?

39:24.000 --> 39:26.100
It's okay, Jessica,
I'm here.

39:26.100 --> 39:28.600
- Oh, I thought I'd lost you.
- Have fun.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.100
I'm sorry.

39:39.200 --> 39:41.000
W- What's happening?

39:41.000 --> 39:43.300
It's okay. Our lines got crossed with
some lawyer. It's all right.

39:43.400 --> 39:46.100
- I got his phone. I got his car.
- Okay.

39:46.100 --> 39:48.400
- Shit.
- What is it?

39:48.500 --> 39:51.800
It's a tunnel!

39:51.800 --> 39:55.000
Whoa, whoa! Jesus!

39:55.100 --> 39:57.000
- What's happening?
- Get out of the way!

39:57.100 --> 39:58.300
Can you back up?

39:58.300 --> 40:00.300
I can't. There's traffic.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.600
You can't loose me.

40:04.300 --> 40:05.900
Do you hear me?

40:05.900 --> 40:07.300
I'm backing up.

40:20.400 --> 40:23.900
Oh, look who's coming back.
Awesome! Come on, buddy.

40:23.900 --> 40:26.100
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, are you?

40:26.100 --> 40:28.200
Suck it!

40:32.200 --> 40:34.300
Oh, I am in deep shit!

40:47.000 --> 40:49.100
- Shit!
- What?

40:49.100 --> 40:52.600
- They're already here.
- Ryan, just find Craig.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.800
Don't worry,
don't worry.

40:54.900 --> 40:57.000
I got them.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.100
This is the final
boarding call for Orly,

41:08.200 --> 41:10.500
flight 180,
with service to Paris...

41:17.100 --> 41:19.500
Okay, what does
your husband look like?

41:19.500 --> 41:20.900
Please have your
boarding passes ready

41:21.000 --> 41:22.800
before entering
the security checkpoint...

41:22.800 --> 41:25.100
About six feet tall,

41:26.600 --> 41:29.300
really good shape, 40s.

41:29.300 --> 41:31.800
What else?
What's he wearing?

41:31.900 --> 41:34.800
Blue jeans, blue jeans,
he wears blue jeans all the time.

41:34.900 --> 41:37.700
A Lakers jacket.
He had that on this morning.

41:37.800 --> 41:40.800
No, it's ridiculous.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.700
Okay, man,
I'll call you later.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.700
Have a wonderful trip,
Mr. Clouseau.

41:50.700 --> 41:52.900
Ah, oui-oui.

41:58.600 --> 42:00.600
I'm sorry, excuse me.

42:00.600 --> 42:03.100
Or I miss
my flight.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.300
This is code red,
code red.

42:29.300 --> 42:30.900
Concourse A.
Security checkpoint.

42:30.900 --> 42:32.600
Excuse me.
Step this way, please.

42:32.600 --> 42:34.500
- Is there a problem?
- Is this your jacket, Sir?

42:34.600 --> 42:36.100
- Yeah.
- He's got a gun.

42:36.100 --> 42:37.200
Wait, wait!

42:37.300 --> 42:38.800
Down, down, down!

42:38.900 --> 42:40.100
Don't move, don't move.

42:40.200 --> 42:43.100
- Stay down.
- All right, take it easy.

42:43.100 --> 42:45.700
We're police officers.
What's the matter with you?

42:45.800 --> 42:48.600
Look in the goddamn tray.
Check my ID.

42:48.700 --> 42:50.700
He's a cop.

42:52.800 --> 42:54.100
All right, back off.

42:54.200 --> 42:56.200
That's what
I was trying to tell you.

42:56.200 --> 42:58.400
Jesus Christ, Jessica,
these guys are cops.

42:58.400 --> 43:01.700
What the hell
is going on here?

43:01.700 --> 43:03.900
This doesn't make
any sense.

43:03.900 --> 43:07.000
All right,
I see "left field. "

43:07.000 --> 43:10.800
Do you see Craig?
Do you see him?

43:14.600 --> 43:17.600
- I got him.
- Oh, thank God!

43:17.600 --> 43:20.000
- Don't ask questions, just follow me.
- Get off me.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.700
- Trust me. Your wife sent me.
- What?!

43:22.700 --> 43:24.700
Look, they are here and they are
looking for you.

43:24.700 --> 43:26.600
- They already have your family.
- What are you talking about?

43:26.600 --> 43:28.700
Just let me explain it
to you, just trust me.

43:28.700 --> 43:29.800
- Here, here he is.
- What?

43:29.900 --> 43:32.000
Okay.

43:41.900 --> 43:43.200
- This is it.
- Yeah.

43:45.100 --> 43:47.000
Hey, bro, this isn't
my wife, okay?

43:47.000 --> 43:50.500
My wife's name is Patty.
My name is Ed. Good luck.

44:20.700 --> 44:22.700
You goddamn animals
better not have hurt them.

44:22.800 --> 44:24.800
Animals?

44:30.500 --> 44:32.600
We just recovered
the stolen vehicle.

44:32.600 --> 44:34.200
It's heading
to Quicksilver Towing.

44:34.300 --> 44:36.100
We're gonna have a look around
for the suspect.

44:36.100 --> 44:38.700
Shit!

45:00.000 --> 45:02.200
- Craig! No! No!
- Jess! Jess!

45:02.300 --> 45:03.900
No!

45:04.000 --> 45:07.700
Here she is. We've got your kid.
Now where is it?

45:07.800 --> 45:12.100
Tell them, tell them they've got the
wrong family. That it's a mistake.

45:12.100 --> 45:16.800
Oh, God, Jess, I'm sorry!
This isn't a mistake.

45:16.800 --> 45:18.900
Listen to me.
I've made arrangements.

45:18.900 --> 45:20.900
It's in a safety
deposit box.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.500
And it's got special instructions that
if anybody gets to it...

45:24.500 --> 45:26.700
No! No!

45:26.800 --> 45:27.700
Stop it!

45:27.800 --> 45:29.800
Here is the deal, Craig.

45:29.800 --> 45:32.200
Either you give us
what we want,

45:32.300 --> 45:35.000
or I blow her brains
all over you right now.

45:35.100 --> 45:37.400
Your call. It's an 85¢
bullet to me, Craig.

45:38.800 --> 45:42.600
Okay, okay, please, please, God.
Please don't hurt her, please.

45:42.600 --> 45:45.300
It's in our bank
in Century City.

45:45.300 --> 45:46.900
Please, don't hurt her.

45:46.900 --> 45:48.800
- Please! I love you, Jess.
- No! No!

45:48.800 --> 45:51.400
You'll have help
in the bank.

45:51.400 --> 45:54.500
Please, don't hurt her, please!
Jess, I love you!

45:54.500 --> 45:57.900
- Please, don't hurt her.
- No!

45:58.000 --> 46:00.900
Ryan, they've gone
to the Brenner Building

46:00.900 --> 46:03.500
on Olympic
and Century Park.

46:03.500 --> 46:07.000
Hey, change of plan.
I gotta get to Century City fast.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.500
This definitely has
a smoother feel.

46:18.600 --> 46:20.600
And the fruit acid
is still...

46:20.700 --> 46:22.800
burning the shit
out of my face.

46:22.900 --> 46:25.900
Okay, well then I think we're definitely
gonna have to go with this pink one.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.900
No, Mare, it's
highway robbery.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.900
What about the...
the other blue one?

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
No, I didn't like
the way that one dried.

46:33.100 --> 46:34.700
I think it's the uh...

46:34.800 --> 46:36.900
I think it's the live algae
in this one.

46:36.900 --> 46:38.900
Mare, listen to me.

46:38.900 --> 46:41.000
I'm not being
negative, okay?

46:41.100 --> 46:43.100
But I think
this is bullshit.

46:43.100 --> 46:46.100
Live algae
at $80 a pop?!

46:46.100 --> 46:47.700
And we're rubbing it
on our face?

46:47.700 --> 46:49.800
Do you know how much algae
there is in the world?

46:49.800 --> 46:51.800
Honey, this one works.

46:51.800 --> 46:55.500
Yes, but maybe it's
the... the collagen.

46:55.600 --> 46:57.900
No, sweetie,
they all have collagen.

46:57.900 --> 47:00.000
I have to get that
'cause it might be the painter.

47:04.900 --> 47:07.300
Authorities are asking
for your help

47:07.300 --> 47:09.700
in identifying this man
believed to be responsible

47:09.700 --> 47:12.000
for today's
bizarre string of crimes.

47:12.100 --> 47:16.200
It started with a robbery
at gunpoint of a 457 cellular store.

47:16.200 --> 47:19.800
We were afraid he was gonna try to rob
the cash registers.

47:19.800 --> 47:23.400
But all he ended up doing
was buying a charger.

47:23.400 --> 47:26.200
Buying?! He bought that charger.
He paid for it?

47:26.200 --> 47:29.300
Yeah, actually
he overpaid it.

47:29.300 --> 47:31.300
'Cause we have
this sale going on.

47:31.300 --> 47:34.300
Well, There you have it,
a bizarre twist in today's crime spree...

47:34.300 --> 47:36.000
a criminal who appears
at least at moments

47:36.000 --> 47:37.700
to be honest.
Back to the newsroom.

47:37.800 --> 47:39.600
He continued his crime spree

47:39.600 --> 47:43.200
by stealing an $80,000
Porsche Carrera at gunpoint.

47:43.300 --> 47:46.800
I basically got cut off
by this young man,

47:46.800 --> 47:48.500
very good-looking,
in a security car.

47:48.600 --> 47:51.100
And he was on the phone
talking to his friend, Jessica

47:51.100 --> 47:53.500
who was supposedly
"kidnapped. "

47:53.600 --> 47:55.400
Whatever the...
like... you know...

47:55.400 --> 47:57.700
and then, uh, basically he just
held me up at gunpoint

47:57.800 --> 48:00.100
and stole my Porsche.

48:08.700 --> 48:10.700
Directory assistance.

48:10.700 --> 48:13.200
Yeah, I need the number
of a residence, please.

48:13.300 --> 48:16.500
Jessica Martin
in Brentwood.

48:16.500 --> 48:20.600
That number is 555-6763.

48:20.600 --> 48:22.600
For an additional 40...

48:28.700 --> 48:31.700
Hi, you've reached
the Martins.

48:31.700 --> 48:35.300
Leave your number
and we'll call you back.

49:04.800 --> 49:07.400
She had an accent...

49:13.500 --> 49:17.400
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

49:25.200 --> 49:27.800
Thank you.

49:46.600 --> 49:48.200
Whoa, hey!

49:55.200 --> 49:57.300
I'm sure once all
the paperwork is done...

49:57.400 --> 50:00.200
we should be getting it
in the next four or five days...

50:07.500 --> 50:10.400
Yeah.

50:10.400 --> 50:13.500
Ryan, what are you
going to do now?

50:13.600 --> 50:15.900
I haven't had a clue
what I was doing all day.

50:22.600 --> 50:25.900
Mr. Martin. Oh, my...
are you all right?

50:26.000 --> 50:27.800
Car accident, I'm fine.

50:27.800 --> 50:31.100
I just need to get
back into my deposit box.

50:32.300 --> 50:35.000
I don't know what's in it.

50:35.100 --> 50:37.800
I just know
if they get it, we're dead.

50:37.800 --> 50:40.500
JT, will you show Mr. Martin
to his deposit box?

50:40.500 --> 50:42.600
Don't let them
get it, Ryan.

51:05.300 --> 51:08.400
Excuse me.

51:08.400 --> 51:10.500
- Come on, come on, let's go.
- What's going on?

51:12.900 --> 51:15.600
- No!
- Get some help.

51:15.600 --> 51:18.000
Run!

51:19.500 --> 51:21.100
Drop your weapon.

51:21.200 --> 51:25.000
L.A.P.D., lock the building down.
Dimitri, get him out of here.

53:01.100 --> 53:03.600
No.

53:09.400 --> 53:11.500
Shit!

53:11.500 --> 53:13.000
Damn it!

53:13.000 --> 53:15.400
Deason, back of the building,
back of the building now.

54:11.100 --> 54:13.400
Ethan, he's gone.

54:21.700 --> 54:23.200
It's heading
to Quicksilver Towing.

54:23.200 --> 54:25.600
We're gonna have
a look around for the suspect.

54:30.100 --> 54:33.200
Hey, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

54:33.200 --> 54:36.300
Follow that tow truck.

54:57.400 --> 54:59.200
Craig Martin here.

54:59.300 --> 55:02.400
Now this building has 5,000 square feet
to use as offi...

55:02.400 --> 55:04.100
What the hell?

55:04.100 --> 55:06.500
Jesus.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.900
Are these cops?
What are they doing?

55:19.900 --> 55:21.700
Waste this guy.

55:21.800 --> 55:23.300
All right.
Light 'em up, boss.

55:23.300 --> 55:25.200
Who they?... what the...

55:25.300 --> 55:28.300
Oh, Jesus.

55:28.400 --> 55:32.000
Oh, God! Oh, Je...

55:32.100 --> 55:34.900
Jack, get that asshole.

55:37.700 --> 55:39.500
Shit.

55:48.200 --> 55:50.200
I'm a dead man.

56:10.700 --> 56:12.800
Ms. Martin?

56:19.300 --> 56:21.500
Ms. Martin!

57:21.100 --> 57:24.900
Police.
Anybody here?

57:31.900 --> 57:34.500
Police officer.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
27 years!

58:27.000 --> 58:29.400
27 years
without this shit!

58:32.100 --> 58:34.100
Where's Jessica Martin?

58:34.100 --> 58:35.500
Who are you?

58:35.500 --> 58:37.200
I am a cop.

58:48.400 --> 58:50.700
Shit.

58:53.800 --> 58:55.800
9-1-1.

58:55.800 --> 58:58.700
Yes, Operator,
I'm a police officer.

58:58.700 --> 59:03.500
I need paramedics
to 3270 Bonhill Road.

59:03.500 --> 59:06.100
3270 Bonhill Road.

59:06.200 --> 59:08.200
One moment, please.

59:22.300 --> 59:24.600
All right, no, no, no,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

59:24.600 --> 59:26.600
Would you just
give me back my goddamn car?

59:26.700 --> 59:29.600
Don't take that tone
of voice with me, sir.

59:29.600 --> 59:32.200
I already told you.
We do not release vehicles

59:32.200 --> 59:33.600
until all impound fees
are paid.

59:33.600 --> 59:35.400
Hey, you know what?
That's really awesome.

59:35.500 --> 59:38.400
But guess what? I did not ask for it
to get impounded, okay?

59:38.400 --> 59:40.400
I got carjacked.
Do you know what that is?

59:40.400 --> 59:43.300
A carjacking? Where a jackoff comes up
to you, sticks a gun to your head

59:43.300 --> 59:46.700
and says... hey, buddy, get out of... I
was car... I had it stolen from me.

59:46.700 --> 59:48.700
Sir, you want
your car back or not?

59:48.700 --> 59:50.900
Do I want my...

59:51.000 --> 59:53.200
I don't know... let me think
about it for a second...

59:53.300 --> 59:55.600
yes, but I'm not
paying for it.

59:56.900 --> 59:59.000
Howie, take her
on back.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.500
Howie? Howie... no.
Howie!

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:03.800
Howie, cut it out.
You're not...

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.900
just... okay, fine.

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.200
That's fine, it's fine.
It's all bad.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.100
I'm just gonna... this is what I'm gonna
do... I'm gonna pay you, okay?

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.500
Never mind, Howie.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.700
Who do I make it out to?
Lady who sucks? Is that it?

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:17.400
I tell you right now,
here you go.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.500
One scratch on the car
and guess who gets an ass whip...?

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.600
Hey, that's my car!

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:25.400
That's my car! Oh, no, this isn't
happening, this isn't happening.

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.800
That ain't Howie.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.700
Thank you. Yes.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:46.500
Well, you missed
all the major pipes.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.300
And you're gonna need
about five stitches.

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.000
But some of this tissue
looks gangrenous.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.800
That's avocado mud mask.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.300
It's for combination skin.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.800
Moon? You all right?

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.900
Yeah.

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.800
Can you give us
a minute, fellas?

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.400
Jack, I didn't know
she was a cop. L...

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:22.000
Hey, Moon, take a breath, okay?
It's gonna be okay.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:27.000
You just gotta tell me exactly
what happened here.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.800
I don't know. I'm still trying
to figure it out.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:32.800
I went inside. I clearly identified
myself as a cop

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.500
and she just
opened fire on me.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.500
She didn't say a word.
She just started shooting.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.900
I checked her ID.
Dana Bayback...

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:43.500
Bayback...? No.
I never heard of her.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.400
She was pretending
to be Jessica Martin.

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.200
Hold on a second.
Who's Jessica Martin?

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.500
The woman who owns
the house.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.800
And I think the real Jessica Martin
is in trouble, Jack.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:01.000
Did... did Bayback... did she say anything
to you at all, anything?

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:03.200
Nothing.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.200
She never had a chance.

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.700
It's gonna be okay.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.400
Hello?

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:31.300
Hello? Are you there?

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:34.600
You little bitch.

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:54.100
I wanna know who
you were just talking to.

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:01.600
No! Ow!

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.800
First I'm gonna kill you,
then I'm gonna kill your little kid.

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:12.700
Oh, you wanna play?

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.400
What did you do to me?

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.500
10th grade biology.
Brachial artery

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:30.700
pumps 30 liters
of blood a minute.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.500
But there's only five
in the human body.

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:36.600
I'm sorry. God!

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.600
Bitch!

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.100
- Mom!
- Ricky.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:31.000
Ricky? Baby, are you okay?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.500
I can't get out of here.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.700
Yeah? Ethan!

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:39.100
- You better take this.
- What is it?

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.900
I got what you're
looking for.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.200
- Oh?
- Yeah.

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:45.600
Okay, and what I do
for it?

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.100
What?!

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.900
What I do for what I looking for?
You tell me now.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.500
Wait, who's this?
What number did I call?

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.400
You call me
on the payphone.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.100
You waste my time.
I have pictures to draw.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude.
Chill out.

01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.600
No, you don't tell me what to chill.
My mother tells me to chill.

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:02.100
I sit here, I draw people
telling me to chill out all the time.

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:04.500
You don't tell me what to chill.
I chill you.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.500
Chad!

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.700
I thought you said
you had this under control.

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:11.400
- It is.
- Oh, really?

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.900
Why don't you ask
Bayback about that?

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.600
I heard about the cop.
She handled it already.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.600
Oh, yeah? She handled that before
or after he killed her?

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.800
What?

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:24.100
Bayback is dead.

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:26.900
A cop was investigating
Jessica Martin's disappearance.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.800
Something about some kid
who tipped him off.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.600
- He knows too much.
- Mooney doesn't know shit.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:34.100
And let's just leave
the thinking to me, okay?

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.100
Go back to the bank,
get the video of the kid.

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:46.200
Check every frame till you find one we
can use to ID that son of a bitch.

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.200
You got it.
Dimitri!

01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:00.200
Ricky!
Listen to me.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.100
Get away from the window.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.400
Do you see the cabinet
in the corner?

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.600
Go over there
and get behind it.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.800
No! Don't leave me!
Don't leave me.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.000
No, I'm not
gonna leave you.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.800
I'm not gonna leave you.
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.800
I'm gonna take you home.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.600
Okay, Mommy.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.700
Get outside now!

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:02.200
Come on, baby,
get in the back seat.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:05.200
Get down, hurry!

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.700
Get down.

01:08:25.899 --> 01:08:28.300
Get out of the car now.

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:30.100
Mom.

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.899
- Get out of the car.
- No!

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:34.700
No, don't!

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:38.000
- Get out of the car.
- No, don't! Don't!

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.800
You wanna save
that boy here?

01:08:40.899 --> 01:08:42.100
Get out of the car,
you bitch!

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:44.000
Don't, no!

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.800
Get out, bitch!

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.500
- Who did you tell?
- Nobody.

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.300
Lying bitch!

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.399
Who is that kid at the bank?

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:00.800
I don't know...

01:09:00.899 --> 01:09:03.899
You are dead.
Your family is finished.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:11.399
Bad timing, Tanner.

01:09:11.399 --> 01:09:13.899
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:21.100
How did you get
this number?

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.200
Well, modern technology
is amazing, you know.

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.500
My phone remembers
the last 50 incoming calls.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.800
What do you want?

01:09:26.899 --> 01:09:29.000
I want the woman
and her family.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.500
Okay, now let me tell you
what I want.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.600
I want you to tell me
where you are right now.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:36.600
Or bad things are gonna happen
to this little family.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.800
Sorry,
it doesn't work that way.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:46.300
Oh, really?
Go cut the kid's throat.

01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:49.300
Fine. You lost.
Nice talking to you.

01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:59.500
Ring.

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:05.400
Come on, ring.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.100
Ring!

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:13.600
Get the point?

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.900
You're playing
with fire, kid.

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:18.800
Yeah, know what? You're lucky I'm still
talking to your sorry ass, all right?

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:22.500
From here on out, you do as I say,
exactly as I say.

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:26.400
Or I slap this bitch on "Nightline"
and call it a day, okay?

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.200
So how do you want
to do this?

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:33.000
Santa Monica Pier.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.700
No. Too busy.

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:36.800
Yeah, that's kind
of the idea, dickhead.

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:41.500
How will I recognize you?

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.500
You let me
worry about that.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.300
Give me a number
I can reach you.

01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:49.500
555-0167.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.700
I can hardly wait.

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:54.800
Me too.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:57.900
Yeah?

01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.300
- Where's your cop friend?
- He's right behind me.

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.700
We're making a trade with the kid
at the Santa Monica Pier.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.500
- Your boy can ID him.
- All right, I'm on it.

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:10.200
So how's he looking?

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.200
He needs to go
to the hospital.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.900
- Why? What's up?
- No, it's nothing.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.500
Come on, what's up?

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.200
We caught a break with that kid that
robbed the cell phone store.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:19.700
That's the kid
who was in the station.

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:22.000
Yeah well, we know he is at
the Santa Monica Pier,

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:24.700
but no one can ID him.
No one knows what he looks like.

01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:27.600
I do. I saw him this morning.
I can point him out to you.

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.600
Absolutely not. You need to get stitches
or it's gonna open up again.

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:33.300
Here, you take care of him.
I can wait 20 minutes.

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.600
You're sure
you're up for this?

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:37.000
Come on, let's solve
this goddamn thing.

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.500
All right.

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.300
Ethan, I'm here.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.100
- Dimitri,
- I'm in position.

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.600
You here?

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:32.100
Yeah.

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.900
Showtime, he's on.

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:36.900
So now what?

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:39.200
First you show me
the Martins are okay.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:43.000
There's a black van in the parking lot
at the northwest corner,

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.400
next to the Spy Sunglass
truck.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.300
Okay, I can see it.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:52.100
He's within
visual of the van.

01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:55.100
Now look at
the passenger side window.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.600
Deason, show the woman.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.500
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.300
We found him yet?

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.400
No, I don't see him.

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.700
He's the one on the cell phone,
you idiot.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.800
Everybody's
on a cell phone.

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:19.300
Six feet tall,

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:21.300
Caucasian,

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:24.300
light brown hair,
sandy hair, about 20.

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.700
I wish I could remember
what he was wearing.

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:30.700
Your turn, now you show me
something.

01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:35.500
- No, first you let them go.
- I don't think so.

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.000
Not until after
you give me the camera.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.600
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:42.800
You know, it does me no good
to hand over the videotape,

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.500
then you guys
turn around and take us out.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.700
I swore I wouldn't do that.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.900
Like you swore
to protect and serve?

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:53.900
- Look, it's your choice.
- Excuse me.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.500
Either the Martins or the videotape.
Either way, I'm walking in five minutes.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.900
I'm warning you.
Shit!

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:02.500
I cannot believe you.
Where have you been?

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:06.800
- Chloe!
- Here. There he is.

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:10.000
I got him. He's across from the arcade
talking to some girl.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Damn it, Ryan, you know
how long I waited for those t-shirts?

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.500
That was so important to me.

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.600
Look, I can explain it to you.
I just can't do it right now.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.000
It's not safe. There are
people after me right now.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.700
God, I tried to call you
and your phone is off.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.500
Hey, kid, I've been
looking for you.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.700
It's me, Mooney
from the police station.

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:27.500
- Shit!
- No, wait, wait, wait,

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.800
wait a second, it's... ouch!

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.900
Hey, there you are, kid.

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:33.500
You run, everyone dies.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.900
Would you relax?

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
He's a cop.
He's with me.

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:40.600
Jessica Martin?
You were right.

01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:42.500
I got the kid.

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.600
Copy.

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.700
We're all good
here, right?

01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:52.300
- Hey, Mooney, you don't look so hot.
- Nah, I'm all right.

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.900
No, I wanna get you over to the hospital
and get that checked out.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.700
- This is detective Dimitri, C.I.D.
- Hey.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.700
Get him over to the hospital.
Get him looked at.

01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:06.800
Just relax, will you?
You're in good hands.

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:09.700
Yeah.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.700
Will someone please explain to me
what's going on?

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.400
Who is she?

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.000
She's nobody.
I've never seen her before.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.500
Let's go have a little chat about
Jessica Martin, huh?

01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:50.200
God, that felt good.

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.200
This... this is nothing.

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.700
Except my wife is gonna kill me
when she sees it.

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:03.200
That is it.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:04.500
All right, we've got it.

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:08.300
We're all done here.
Take care of the Martins.

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:11.700
Tanner... we can take care of him
back at the safe house,

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.500
not here.

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.900
Dude! What are you doin'?
I was like...

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.200
take a walk.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.300
Shit!

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.000
Yeah-ah!

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:20.600
Now get up! Up!

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:27.300
Put them on.
Put them on.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.800
You were gonna shoot me?

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.400
It's all right.
I'm a policeman.

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.800
That's a very bad man.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.800
The kid's in a boathouse
under the pier.

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:13.300
Copy that?

01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:15.300
Ethan, you copy that?

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:17.400
Copy.

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:35.800
Last chance, kid.

01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:39.000
You come out now,
I'll make it easy on you.

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.700
Okay then.

01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:48.500
You wanna do it this way?

01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:55.100
Cocky little piece
of shit!

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:25.200
Time's up.
Bye-bye.

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.000
Oh, shit.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:55.000
Do you have any idea how much trouble
you've caused me today?

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.500
Who are you?

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.800
How did you get involved?

01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:10.400
I just answered my phone.

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:15.100
Shit.

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:20.300
You're pathetic.

01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:22.500
The bitch has
more fight than you.

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:26.100
Come on.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.400
Okay, that's enough.

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:46.600
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!
Please. Please!

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.600
Let him up.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:51.200
Help me.
They're dirty cops.

01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:54.300
He attacked my partner.
He tried to kill me.

01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:56.000
I said let him up.

01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.900
You're gonna believe
this lying piece of shit over a cop?

01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:00.600
It doesn't matter
what I believe.

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.600
What's important is that
you believe

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:06.100
I would put a bullet in your skull
if you don't let him up.

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:09.100
They kidnapped Jessica Martin
and her family.

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:11.600
- Hands in the air.
- What?!

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.400
Do it, now!

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:19.100
Turn around.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.900
Drop the gun.

01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:34.200
We've got to get out of here.
Stay with me.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:06.500
Ah, God, aah.
My leg.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.700
Stay there.

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:10.800
Okay.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:12.800
No.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.200
- Mom, no!
- Ricky, look at me. Look at me, son.

01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:23.100
Look at me.

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:25.600
All right, Mom, hurry.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:28.000
Mom!

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.400
Ryan.

01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:53.000
Jessica.

01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:59.600
It's okay, it's over.

01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:12.700
Through, please...

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:15.800
- Absolutely ridiculous.
- Save it.

01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:19.500
Oh, Bob, thank god.
Will you back me up here?

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.300
I'm getting set up,
man, I...

01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:23.700
Hey, sorry to interrupt. Have you guys
seen these new phones?

01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:26.400
They're amazing.
They've got technology

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:29.100
and features like...

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:30.900
video recording.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.100
Moon, don't listen
to this punk.

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.800
They destroyed
the original recording

01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:37.600
but not till after I copied it
into my phone.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.800
It's footage of this officer
and his men

01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:42.100
robbing and murdering
two drug dealers in an alley.

01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:43.400
This is total bullshit.

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:46.200
Jack, did I ever tell you
how much I hate dirty cops?

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:49.100
I think those chemicals
from your beauty parlor

01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:50.800
are getting
your brain, Moon.

01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:54.200
