HAVE GONE ON, THIS EXCHANGE

03:37.603 --> 03:39.870
BETWEEN TRUMP AND ZELENSKY HAS

03:39.870 --> 03:40.870
MORPHED INTO SOMETHING MUCH

03:40.870 --> 03:42.203
DEEPER AND MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT

FOR THIS WHITE HOUSE.

04:03.303 --> 04:04.937
THING IS GOING --

04:04.937 --> 04:06.337

SECURITY ADVISER AND RUDY

04:12.804 --> 04:13.070

04:13.070 --> 04:14.103
AN INCREDIBLE CAST.

04:14.103 --> 04:19.136
IT IS TRULY ALL THE PRESIDENT'S

04:19.136 --> 04:19.937
MEN.

04:19.937 --> 04:21.603
THIS IS A BIG FUCKING DEAL.

04:21.603 --> 04:22.236
>> AT THIS MOMENT DONALD TRUMP'S

04:22.236 --> 04:24.770
FORTUNES ARE RIDING ON

04:24.770 --> 04:26.970
REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE.

04:26.970 --> 04:27.203
IT

04:27.203 --> 04:28.704
AT PRECISELY THAT MOMENT HE

04:28.704 --> 04:30.370
DECIDES TO DO SOMETHING THAT

04:30.370 --> 04:30.837
PISSES LITERALLY ALL.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.270
RED WALL OFF.

04:33.270 --> 04:36.303
>> THE U.S. IS WITHDRAWING

04:36.303 --> 04:36.937
TROOPS FROM SYRIA.

04:36.937 --> 04:39.170
THAT CLEARS THE WAY FOR THE

04:39.170 --> 04:40.870
TURKISH MILITARY TO BEGIN AN

04:40.870 --> 04:43.036
ASSAULT ON U.S. BACKED KURDISH

04:43.036 --> 04:43.303
FIGHTERS.

04:43.303 --> 04:43.770
>> WOW.

04:43.770 --> 04:45.737
REPUBLICANS ARE AGHAST AND ABOMB

04:45.737 --> 04:47.403
NATED ON THE POLICY SIDE OF

04:47.403 --> 04:47.603
THAT.

04:47.603 --> 04:50.036
IN A WAY IT IS KIND OF

04:50.036 --> 04:50.670
CONVENIENT POLITICALLY BECAUSE

04:50.670 --> 04:51.470
THEY CAN SAY, LOOK, I'M STANDING

04:51.470 --> 04:52.770
UP TO THE PRESIDENT ON

04:52.770 --> 04:54.737
SOMETHING, AND MEANWHILE IT

04:54.737 --> 04:55.970
STIFFENS THEIR BACKBONE ON

04:55.970 --> 04:56.303
IMPEACHMENT.

04:56.303 --> 04:58.303
>> THE REST OF THIS WEEK HOLDS

04:58.303 --> 05:00.003
MORE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES.

05:00.003 --> 05:01.770
>> THURSDAY IS KIND OF THE BIG

05:01.770 --> 05:03.837
RED LETTER DAY FOR THE TRUMP

05:03.837 --> 05:04.203

05:04.203 --> 05:11.270
THAT'S WHEN GORDON SONLAND,

05:11.270 --> 05:16.403
AMBASSADOR TO THE EU IS GOING TO

05:16.403 --> 05:17.437
BE TESTIFYING.

05:17.437 --> 05:19.103
>> IT STARTED WITH ONE THING,

05:19.103 --> 05:20.303
SUDDENLY GOT THREE THINGS AND

05:20.303 --> 05:22.737
EACH OF THOSE THINGS TURNS INTO

05:22.737 --> 05:23.970
THREE MORE THINGS.

05:23.970 --> 05:25.837
THE THING IN MY MIND ALL DAY.

05:25.837 --> 05:27.470
>> ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT

05:27.470 --> 05:29.503
POEMS IN THE HISTORY OF

05:29.503 --> 05:30.103
LITERATURE.

05:30.103 --> 05:32.904
WE ALWAYS HEAR PEOPLE QUOTE

05:32.904 --> 05:36.904
THINGS FALL APART.

05:36.904 --> 05:37.770
ANARCHY IS LOOSE AROUND THE

05:37.770 --> 05:38.136
WORLD.

05:38.136 --> 05:40.203
THE THING THAT STARTS THAT

05:40.203 --> 05:41.904
PHRASE IN THE POEM IS WHEN YATES

05:41.904 --> 05:44.537
WRITES, TURNING AND TURNING IN

05:44.537 --> 05:45.637
THE WIDENING JIRE.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.570
IT'S A SPIRAL AS IT GETS WIDER

05:47.570 --> 05:48.904
AS IT GOES UPWARD.

05:48.904 --> 05:50.270
I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER

05:50.270 --> 05:51.870
METAPHOR IN SOME WAYS.

05:51.870 --> 05:53.537
WE'RE KIND OF LIKE PLUNGED NOW

05:53.537 --> 05:57.470
INTO THE EVER WIDENING JIRE OF

05:57.470 --> 05:58.670
THIS STORY.

05:58.670 --> 06:01.670
>> I GOT NOTHING AFTER THAT.

06:14.737 --> 06:17.337
>> LIVE FROM JUST NORTH OF

06:17.337 --> 06:19.603
COLUMBUS, OHIO, THIS IS THE CNN

06:25.937 --> 06:29.637
HAVE ANY CHOICE BUT TO IMPEACH

06:29.637 --> 06:30.070
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

06:30.070 --> 06:31.103
>> WE DON'T.

06:31.103 --> 06:33.470
IN MY JUDGMENT TRUMP IS THE MOST

06:33.470 --> 06:35.537
CORRUPT PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY

06:35.537 --> 06:35.937
OF THIS COUNTRY.

06:35.937 --> 06:36.603
>> NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW AND

06:36.603 --> 06:40.470
THAT INCLUDES THE PRESIDENT OF

06:40.470 --> 06:40.870
THE UNITED STATES.

06:40.870 --> 06:42.236
>> RUDY GIULIANI, THE PRESIDENT

06:42.236 --> 06:43.737
AND HIS THUGS HAVE ALREADY

06:43.737 --> 06:46.737
PROVEN THAT THEY, IN FACT, ARE

06:46.737 --> 06:47.136
FLAT LINED.

06:47.136 --> 06:49.337
>> WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY

06:49.337 --> 06:52.270
TO PURSUE THIS IMPEACHMENT.

06:52.270 --> 06:53.337
>> I DON'T THINK THIS

06:53.337 --> 06:54.503
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS IS GOING TO

06:54.503 --> 06:55.370
TAKE VERY LONG BECAUSE AS A

06:55.370 --> 06:56.804
FORMER PROSECUTOR I KNOW A

06:56.804 --> 06:57.670
CONFESSION WHEN I SEE IT.

06:57.670 --> 07:02.303
>> IT'S A VALUE ADDED TAX.

07:02.303 --> 07:03.503
>> ALEX IS IN THE HOUSE.

07:03.503 --> 07:06.170
>> I JUST SIT IN GREEN ROOMS

07:06.170 --> 07:08.670
WITH EXTENSIVE CAMERA CREWS.

07:08.670 --> 07:10.770

WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

07:11.970 --> 07:14.770

DIFFERENTLY PEOPLE TREAT WARREN

07:21.837 --> 07:22.136
>> YEAH.

07:22.136 --> 07:23.637
THEY KEEP GOING AFTER HER.

07:23.637 --> 07:25.103

07:25.103 --> 07:26.303
LIKE, WE LOVE WARREN.

07:26.303 --> 07:27.837
LET'S TALK ABOUT BIDEN.

07:27.837 --> 07:28.804
IT'S LIKE HIGH SCHOOL.

07:28.804 --> 07:30.970
>> NOW THAT SHE'S IN THE RUNNING

07:30.970 --> 07:32.403
FOR HOMECOMING QUEEN PEOPLE ARE

07:32.403 --> 07:33.070
LIKE I HATE HER.

07:33.070 --> 07:34.570
>> SHE WAS SO NICE AND THEN SHE

07:34.570 --> 07:36.670
BECAME THE FRONT-RUNNER AND, YOU

07:36.670 --> 07:37.370
KNOW, IT'S YOUR DEBATE.

07:37.370 --> 07:37.804
IT'S ENTERTAINMENT.

07:37.804 --> 07:42.270
IT'S AMERICA.

07:42.270 --> 07:45.637
>> PLEASE WELCOME ALEX WAGNER.

07:45.637 --> 07:50.503
>> APPRECIATE IT.

07:50.503 --> 07:52.837
>> IF YOU LOOK AT IMPEACHMENT,

07:52.837 --> 07:54.403
EXCUSE ME, I STARTED IT TWO

07:54.403 --> 07:57.070
YEARS AGO BY GETTING 8 MILLION

07:57.070 --> 07:57.503
PEOPLE TO SIGN --

07:57.503 --> 07:58.870
>> DO THE RIGHT THING.

07:58.870 --> 08:01.570
>> ONE MORE.

08:06.103 --> 08:07.603
>> THIS WAS THE FIRST DEBATE IN

08:07.603 --> 08:09.603
WHICH IMPEACHMENT WAS DISCUSSED

08:09.603 --> 08:10.503
AND I THINK THERE'S NO ONE IN

08:10.503 --> 08:11.704
THE AUDIENCE WHO WILL REMEMBER

08:11.704 --> 08:13.704
ANYTHING THAT ANY OF THESE

08:13.704 --> 08:15.804
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES SAID ON

08:15.804 --> 08:17.303
THE TOPIC OTHER THAN THEY'RE ALL

08:17.303 --> 08:17.970
FOR IT.

08:17.970 --> 08:19.337
THE ONLY PERSON YOU CAN SORT OF

08:19.337 --> 08:20.770
SEE KIND OF GET SOME LEVERAGE ON

08:20.770 --> 08:23.003
THIS TOPIC WAS KAMALA HARRIS AND

08:23.003 --> 08:24.804
SHE'S RIGHT BEHIND ME.

08:24.804 --> 08:25.870
I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU.

08:25.870 --> 08:26.503
>> WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

08:26.503 --> 08:28.737
>> I WAS SAYING SOMETHING NICE,

08:28.737 --> 08:29.136
SOMETHING GOOD.

08:29.136 --> 08:30.503
>> I MEAN, YOU CAN JUST --

08:30.503 --> 08:31.136
WHATEVER YOU'RE THINKING.

08:31.136 --> 08:34.103
>> NO, I WAS SAYING THAT IT'S A

08:34.103 --> 08:35.403
CHALLENGE IN THE SITUATION WHERE

08:35.403 --> 08:36.603
IMPEACHMENT IS THE BIGGEST STORY

08:36.603 --> 08:38.837
IN AMERICA AND IT'S LIKE HOW DO

08:38.837 --> 08:40.637
YOU DISTINGUISH YOURSELF ON THE

08:40.637 --> 08:42.737
MOST IMPORTANT TOPIC IN AMERICAN

08:42.737 --> 08:43.003
POLITICS?

08:43.003 --> 08:45.136
>> PART OF THE WAY THAT I

08:45.136 --> 08:45.837
DISTINGUISH MYSELF IS MY

08:45.837 --> 08:46.970
BACKGROUND AS A CAREER

08:46.970 --> 08:47.403
PROSECUTOR.

08:47.403 --> 08:48.603
I LOOK AT THIS THROUGH THE LENS

08:48.603 --> 08:50.570
OF MY CAREER BEING IN COURTROOMS

08:50.570 --> 08:52.070
AND THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY AN

08:52.070 --> 08:52.937
ISSUE ABOUT JUSTICE.

08:52.937 --> 08:56.103
>> IN THE LAST 24 HOURS WE HAVE

08:56.103 --> 08:57.570
SEEN THE FORMER NATIONAL

08:57.570 --> 08:59.537
SECURITY ADVISER, JOHN BOLTON,

08:59.537 --> 09:01.136
SUGGESTING THAT HE THOUGHT THE

09:01.136 --> 09:02.870
PRESIDENT AND RUDY GIULIANI AND

09:02.870 --> 09:04.437
MICK MULVANEY AND OTHERS WERE

09:04.437 --> 09:05.603
COMMITTING A CRIME.

09:05.603 --> 09:06.804
>> EVEN JOHN BOLTON HAS

09:06.804 --> 09:08.036
STANDARDS, AND GOOD FOR HIM

09:08.036 --> 09:09.370
BECAUSE CERTAINLY THERE'S A LOT

09:09.370 --> 09:13.470
I DON'T AGREE WITH ABOUT WHAT HE

09:13.470 --> 09:14.070
HAS DONE AND THE POSITIONS HE

09:14.070 --> 09:15.303
HAS TAKEN, BUT GOOD FOR HIM TO

09:15.303 --> 09:17.770
SAY AT SOME POINT YOU GOT TO PUT

09:17.770 --> 09:18.203
COUNTRY ABOVE PARTY.

09:18.203 --> 09:20.637
GOOD FOR HIM.

09:29.270 --> 09:33.370
>> DAY 12,000 OF THE TRUMP

09:33.370 --> 09:33.737
ADMINISTRATION.

09:33.737 --> 09:34.603
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP FACES

09:34.603 --> 09:36.603
CONDEMNATION FROM BOTH DEMOCRATS

09:36.603 --> 09:37.303
AND REPUBLICANS.

09:37.303 --> 09:38.737
>> FOLLOWING HIS UNILATERAL

09:38.737 --> 09:41.837
DECISION TO WITHDRAW TROOPS FROM

09:41.837 --> 09:42.236
NORTHERN SYRIA.

09:42.236 --> 09:43.370
>> AND ABANDONING OUR ALLIES.

09:43.370 --> 09:44.937
>> ANOTHER BIG DAY ON THE HILL

09:44.937 --> 09:46.470
WITH MORE DEPOSITIONS, POTENTIAL

09:46.470 --> 09:47.303
BOMBSHELLS DROPPING THERE.

09:47.303 --> 09:48.804
ALSO A BIG DAY HERE AT THE WHITE

09:48.804 --> 09:49.070
HOUSE.

09:49.070 --> 09:52.036
THE PRESIDENT MEETING WITH THE

09:52.036 --> 09:53.603
ITALIAN PRESIDENT.

09:53.603 --> 09:55.603
>> SO I VIEW THE SITUATION ON

09:55.603 --> 09:57.503
THE TURKISH BORDER WITH SYRIA TO

09:57.503 --> 10:00.704
BE FOR THE UNITED STATES

10:00.704 --> 10:01.203
STRATEGICALLY BRILLIANT.

10:01.203 --> 10:03.103
OUR SOLDIERS ARE OUT OF THERE.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.203
OUR SOLDIERS ARE TOTALLY SAFE.

10:06.203 --> 10:07.270
THEY'VE GOT TO WORK IT OUT.

10:07.270 --> 10:09.003
MAYBE THEY CAN DO IT WITHOUT

10:09.003 --> 10:09.704
FIGHTING.

10:09.704 --> 10:12.270
SYRIA IS FIGHTING WITH THE

10:12.270 --> 10:14.470
KURDS.

10:14.470 --> 10:14.970
THE KURDS ARE VERY WELL

10:14.970 --> 10:15.236
PROTECTED.

10:15.236 --> 10:16.203
PLUS THEY KNOW HOW TO FIGHT.

10:16.203 --> 10:18.870
BY THE WAY, THEY'RE NO ANGELS

10:18.870 --> 10:19.337
BUT THEY WERE WITH US.

10:19.337 --> 10:20.136
THEY ARE NO ANGELS.

10:20.136 --> 10:21.603
>> MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

10:21.603 --> 10:23.136
RESPONDING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

10:23.136 --> 10:24.103
DECISION AND NOW PRESIDENT

10:24.103 --> 10:24.837
TRUMP'S WORDS.

10:24.837 --> 10:27.103
>> SOME OF THE DAMAGE THAT'S

10:27.103 --> 10:28.270
BEEN DONE IS NOT REVERSIBLE.

10:28.270 --> 10:29.236
>> REPUBLICAN SENATOR LINDSEY

10:29.236 --> 10:30.804
GRAHAM HAD A LOT TO SAY ON

10:30.804 --> 10:31.470
TWITTER THIS AFTERNOON.

10:31.470 --> 10:33.970
>> THIS WILL BE A DISASTER WORSE

10:33.970 --> 10:35.003
THAN PRESIDENT OBAMA'S DECISION

10:35.003 --> 10:35.870
TO LEAVE IRAQ.

10:35.870 --> 10:36.837
>> HE'S MAKING THE BIGGEST

10:36.837 --> 10:40.070
MISTAKE OF HIS PRESIDENCY.

10:40.070 --> 10:41.870
>> LINDSEY GRAHAM JUST SAID OF

10:41.870 --> 10:43.804
YOUR REMARKS THAT YOU MADE IN

10:43.804 --> 10:45.003
THE OVAL OFFICE THAT IF YOU KEEP

10:45.003 --> 10:46.203
TALKING LIKE THAT, QUOTE, THIS

10:46.203 --> 10:49.170
WILL BE A DISASTER WORSE THAN

10:49.170 --> 10:50.403
OBAMA'S DECISION TO LEAVE IRAQ.

10:50.403 --> 10:52.236
>> NO, LINDSEY GRAHAM WOULD LIKE

10:52.236 --> 10:53.403
TO STAY IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOR

10:53.403 --> 10:55.570
THE NEXT 1,000 YEARS WITH

10:55.570 --> 10:56.737
THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS AND

10:56.737 --> 10:57.537
FIGHTING OTHER PEOPLE'S WARS.

10:57.537 --> 10:58.970
I WANT TO GET OUT OF THE MIDDLE

10:58.970 --> 10:59.170
EAST.

10:59.170 --> 11:00.303
AND WE'RE THE BOSS, JUST

11:00.303 --> 11:00.904
REMEMBER THAT.

11:00.904 --> 11:01.970
WE HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL

11:01.970 --> 11:03.670
MILITARY IN THE WORLD BY FAR.

11:03.670 --> 11:10.236
PLEASE.

11:10.236 --> 11:11.870
>> WHEN I READ BOTH THE OLD AND

11:11.870 --> 11:15.003
THE NEW TESTAMENT, GOD

11:15.003 --> 11:18.503
REPEATEDLY USES DEEPLY FLAWED,

11:18.503 --> 11:20.170
IRRATIONAL, SOMETIMES

11:20.170 --> 11:24.737
DYSFUNCTIONAL PERSONALITIES TO

11:24.737 --> 11:25.670
ACHIEVE HIS ENDS FOR HIS OWN

11:25.670 --> 11:25.904
REASONS.

11:25.904 --> 11:28.737
I DON'T CLAIM TO UNDERSTAND WHY.

11:28.737 --> 11:30.036
>> YOU KNOW THAT TRUMP THINKS

11:30.036 --> 11:32.170
THAT THE NEW TESTAMENT IS AN

11:32.170 --> 11:32.704
EDITED VERSION OF THE OLD

11:32.704 --> 11:36.804
TESTAMENT.

11:44.403 --> 11:47.837
>> DOES IT BOTHER YOU THAT THIS

11:47.837 --> 11:50.103
PRESIDENT LIES CONSISTENTLY,

11:50.103 --> 11:52.103
THAT HE'S MORALLY COMPROMISED,

11:52.103 --> 11:55.103
THAT HE'S UNETHICAL?

11:55.103 --> 11:55.737
IS THAT PROBLEMATIC FOR PEOPLE

11:55.737 --> 11:56.737
IN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY?

11:56.737 --> 11:59.670
>> WELL FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T

11:59.670 --> 12:01.370
AGREE WITH THAT CHARACTERIZATION

12:01.370 --> 12:01.770
CHARACTERIZATION.

12:01.770 --> 12:02.303
HE HASN'T LIED TO US.

12:02.303 --> 12:04.136
WHEN HE TOLD US DURING THE

12:04.136 --> 12:09.236
CAMPAIGN HERE'S A LIST OF

12:09.236 --> 12:11.503
QUALIFIED CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE

12:11.503 --> 12:12.804
AND IF YOU ELECT ME PRESIDENT I

12:12.804 --> 12:15.003
PROMISE TO PICK ONE OF THESE AND

12:15.003 --> 12:16.704
HE NOT ONLY KEPT THAT PROMISE,

12:16.704 --> 12:18.904
HE'S KEPT IT A SECOND TIME WITH

12:18.904 --> 12:21.003
BRETT KAVANAUGH, WITH 160 OTHER

12:21.003 --> 12:21.570
FEDERAL JUDGES.

12:21.570 --> 12:23.103
I'M GIVING YOU AN HONEST ANSWER.

12:23.103 --> 12:25.670
HE KEPT HIS WORD TO ME.

12:25.670 --> 12:27.170
>> YOU'VE DESCRIBED THE LATEST

12:27.170 --> 12:29.937
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS AS LESS HERE

12:29.937 --> 12:31.170
THAN THE RUSSIAN HOAX.

12:31.170 --> 12:32.704
WHY?

12:32.704 --> 12:33.904
>> I DON'T THINK THERE WAS EVER

12:33.904 --> 12:34.970
ANYTHING TO THE RUSSIAN HOAX SO

12:34.970 --> 12:35.837
THIS IS LESS THAN ZERO.

12:35.837 --> 12:38.437
>> WHY NOT RUN THIS ALL THROUGH

12:38.437 --> 12:40.403
THE STATE DEPARTMENT?

12:40.403 --> 12:42.337
WHY HIRE A PRIVATE ATTORNEY.

12:42.337 --> 12:45.403
WHY HAVE MICK MULVANEY AND THE

12:45.403 --> 12:46.070
PRESIDENT'S STAFF ALL SUDDENLY

12:46.070 --> 12:47.637
GETTING TIED UP INTO A ROGUE

12:47.637 --> 12:47.937
OPERATION.

12:47.937 --> 12:48.770
>> I DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING THAT

12:48.770 --> 12:49.537
WAS GOING ON.

12:49.537 --> 12:51.570
BILL BARR AND THE JUSTICE

12:51.570 --> 12:52.103
DEPARTMENT AND THE STATE

12:52.103 --> 12:52.904
DEPARTMENT WERE INVOLVED.

12:52.904 --> 12:55.070
BUT IN PARALLEL ANTI-CORRUPTION

12:55.070 --> 12:56.070
INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAD NOTHING

12:56.070 --> 13:01.737
TO DO WITH WHAT RUDY WAS LOOKING

13:01.737 --> 13:02.370
INTO, WHETHER OR NOT UKRAINIAN

13:02.370 --> 13:03.603
INTELLIGENCE INTERVENED IN OUR

13:03.603 --> 13:06.870
ELECTION AND DELIBERATELY MADE

13:06.870 --> 13:07.637
IT LOOK LIKE A RUSSIAN

13:07.637 --> 13:08.670
OPERATION.

13:08.670 --> 13:09.537
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING

13:09.537 --> 13:11.337
WORTHY OF IMPEACHMENT.

13:11.337 --> 13:12.937
>> DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD

13:12.937 --> 13:14.070
JUST FIND OUT?

13:14.070 --> 13:15.670
>> THIS IS A KANGAROO COURT.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.136
THEY'RE SETTING IT UP TO GET THE

13:17.136 --> 13:18.170
RESULTS THAT THEY WANT.

13:18.170 --> 13:19.370
>> YOU CAN ARGUE THE PRESIDENT

13:19.370 --> 13:21.337
SERVED IT UP ON A SILVER

13:21.337 --> 13:21.603
PLATTER.

13:21.603 --> 13:22.403
>> YOU CAN ARGUE THAT BUT I WILL

13:22.403 --> 13:26.036
JUST TELL YOU IN 1998 WHEN THE

13:26.036 --> 13:26.670
REPUBLICANS WENT RIGHT OFF THE

13:26.670 --> 13:29.870
CLIFF AND IMPEACHED BILL

13:29.870 --> 13:31.103
CLINTON, IT WASN'T BILL CLINTON

13:31.103 --> 13:34.036
WHO LOST HIS JOB, IT WAS NEWT

13:34.036 --> 13:34.470
GINGRICH.

13:34.470 --> 13:35.570
AND THERE'S A DARN GOOD CHANCE

13:35.570 --> 13:36.203
THE SAME THING'S GOING TO HAPPEN

13:36.203 --> 13:41.170
TO THEM.

13:41.170 --> 13:42.804
>>> BIPARTISAN GROUP OF HOUSE

13:42.804 --> 13:45.970
LEADERS JUST VOTED TO CONDEMN

13:45.970 --> 13:46.603
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WITHDRAWAL OF

13:46.603 --> 13:47.437
AMERICAN FORCES IN SYRIA.

13:47.437 --> 13:51.203
>> ON THIS VOTE THE AYES ARE

13:51.203 --> 13:51.704
354.

13:51.704 --> 13:54.870
THE NAYS ARE 60.

13:54.870 --> 13:56.103
>> 129 REPUBLICANS VOTED AGAINST

13:56.103 --> 13:59.937
HIM TODAY IN THIS HOUSE

13:59.937 --> 14:04.203
RESOLUTION.

14:04.203 --> 14:05.603
>> AFTER THAT VOTE CONGRESSIONAL

14:05.603 --> 14:07.103
LEADERS HEADED OVER TO TALK WITH

14:07.103 --> 14:08.503
TRUMP ABOUT SYRIA.

14:08.503 --> 14:09.970
ACCORDING TO THE DEMOCRATIC

14:09.970 --> 14:10.804
LEADERS PRESENT, THE MEETING

14:10.804 --> 14:15.170
QUICKLY WENT OFF THE RAILS.

14:15.170 --> 14:17.203
>> WE WERE INVITED TO THE

14:17.203 --> 14:18.503
MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT THAT

14:18.503 --> 14:20.170
COMES AT A VERY DIFFICULT TIME

14:20.170 --> 14:22.236
FOR HIM.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.870
I THINK THAT VOTE PROBABLY GOT

14:23.870 --> 14:25.704
TO THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE WAS

14:25.704 --> 14:27.770
SHAKEN UP BY IT.

14:27.770 --> 14:29.570
THAT'S WHY WE COULDN'T CONTINUE

14:29.570 --> 14:31.470
IN THE MEETING, BECAUSE HE WAS

14:31.470 --> 14:33.603
JUST NOT RELATING TO THE REALITY

14:33.603 --> 14:34.970
OF IT.

14:34.970 --> 14:36.470
>> HE WAS INSULTING,

14:36.470 --> 14:38.603
PARTICULARLY TO THE SPEAKER.

14:38.603 --> 14:39.570
SHE KEPT HER COOL COMPLETELY BUT

14:39.570 --> 14:41.170
HE CALLED HER A THIRD RATE

14:41.170 --> 14:43.804
POLITICIAN.

14:43.804 --> 14:44.437
>> WHAT WE WITNESSED ON THE PART

14:44.437 --> 14:45.337
OF THE PRESIDENT WAS A MELTDOWN.

14:45.337 --> 14:47.904
SAD TO SAY.

14:47.904 --> 14:49.570
>> THE INSULTS CONTINUE WITH THE

14:49.570 --> 14:51.036
PRESIDENT TWEETING WHAT APPEARS

14:51.036 --> 14:53.570
TO BE A WHITE HOUSE PHOTO OF

14:53.570 --> 14:54.170
TODAY'S MEETING WITH THE

14:54.170 --> 14:55.236
CAPTION, NERVOUS NANCY'S

14:55.236 --> 14:56.737
UNHINGED MELTDOWN.

14:56.737 --> 14:58.270
>> THE SPEAKER WAS ASKED ABOUT

14:58.270 --> 14:59.970
THAT PHOTO WHICH SHE NOW

14:59.970 --> 15:05.637
DISPLAYS AS A BADGE OF HONOR

15:05.637 --> 15:07.570
AT THE TOP OF HER TWITTER PAGE.

15:07.570 --> 15:09.637
>> IT LOOKS LIKE SHE IS THE ONLY

15:09.637 --> 15:10.270
ONE WILLING TO STAND UP TO HIM.

15:10.270 --> 15:12.236
>>> YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THE

15:12.236 --> 15:14.837
AMERICAN PEOPLE'S JOB TO KEEP

15:14.837 --> 15:16.337
TRACK OF ALL THIS.

15:16.337 --> 15:17.603
>> YEAH.

15:17.603 --> 15:20.003
>> THEY HIRE THE PRESIDENT.

15:20.003 --> 15:20.637
THE PRESIDENT HIRES THE CABINET

15:20.637 --> 15:21.603
TO DO THIS JOB.

15:21.603 --> 15:23.970
>> MM-HMM.

15:23.970 --> 15:25.637
>> AND WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS

15:25.637 --> 15:28.904
THE DETERIORATION OF THIS

15:28.904 --> 15:29.637
COUNTRY, THE LIKES OF WHICH WE

15:29.637 --> 15:30.270
HAVE NEVER SEEN IN OUR HISTORY.

15:30.270 --> 15:34.637
>> MM-HMM.

15:34.637 --> 15:38.670
>> AND IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN HOW

15:38.670 --> 15:40.303
WE'RE GOING TO -- HOW WE'RE

15:40.303 --> 15:43.637
GOING TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM

15:43.637 --> 15:48.036
WHAT IS AN IRRATIONAL LEADER OF

15:48.036 --> 15:53.437
THE FREE WORLD.

15:53.437 --> 15:55.437
>> JUST A FEW HOURS AGO THE

15:55.437 --> 15:57.070
PRESIDENT HAD A MEETING WITH

15:57.070 --> 15:59.103
HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADER SCHIFF

15:59.103 --> 16:01.070
AND HE APPARENTLY CALLED NANCY

16:01.070 --> 16:04.470
PELOSI A THIRD RATE POLITICIAN.

16:04.470 --> 16:05.170
DO YOU THINK NANCY PELOSI IS

16:05.170 --> 16:08.303
BOTHERED BY A COMMENT LIKE THAT?

16:08.303 --> 16:13.070
>> SHE HAS THE SKIN OF AN

16:13.070 --> 16:13.337
ALLIGATOR.

16:13.337 --> 16:15.670
I UNDERSTAND HE'S NOT HAPPY WITH

16:15.670 --> 16:18.837
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE STARTED AN

16:18.837 --> 16:20.537
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY.

16:20.537 --> 16:23.837
HE STILL HAS AN OBLIGATION TO

16:23.837 --> 16:25.904
WORK WITH THE CONGRESS.

16:25.904 --> 16:27.303
>> YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN BEHIND

16:27.303 --> 16:28.036
CLOSED DOORS.

16:28.036 --> 16:29.470
I KNOW YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT THAT

16:29.470 --> 16:32.270
TESTIMONY, BUT IS A PICTURE

16:32.270 --> 16:32.537
EMERGING?

16:32.537 --> 16:33.904
>> YES.

16:33.904 --> 16:35.670
WE'VE HAD PERSONS COME BEFORE US

16:35.670 --> 16:37.670
WHO HAVE HAD 37 YEARS OF

16:37.670 --> 16:40.670
SERVICE, 27 YEARS OF SERVICE, 34

16:40.670 --> 16:42.937
YEARS OF SERVICE WHO HAVE WORKED

16:42.937 --> 16:47.236
UNDER REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC

16:47.236 --> 16:47.637
PRESIDENTS.

16:47.637 --> 16:51.036
ALL OF THESE CAREER CIVIL

16:51.036 --> 16:52.403
SERVANTS ARE RINGING EMERGENCY

16:52.403 --> 16:53.437
BELLS.

16:53.437 --> 16:56.503
THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN

16:56.503 --> 16:59.537
TRANSFORMED INTO A POLITICAL

16:59.537 --> 17:02.403
OPERATION FOR THE PRESIDENT'S

17:02.403 --> 17:02.737
RE-ELECTION.

17:02.737 --> 17:04.904
>> WITH EVERY PASSING DAY THERE

17:04.904 --> 17:07.837
IS ANOTHER WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL

17:07.837 --> 17:09.036
WHOSE NAME GOES UP IN LIGHTS.

17:09.036 --> 17:10.303
>> I THINK WE'VE PULLED UP THE

17:10.303 --> 17:11.270
ROCK AND THERE'S COCKROACHES

17:11.270 --> 17:14.403
EVERYWHERE.

17:17.937 --> 17:20.570
>> TODAY WE HAVE LOST A GIANT.

17:20.570 --> 17:22.203
>> FLAGS WERE LOWERED TO HALF

17:22.203 --> 17:24.637
STAFF IN HONOR OF CONGRESSMAN

17:24.637 --> 17:25.603
ELIJAH CUMMINGS.

17:25.603 --> 17:26.937
>> THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE

17:26.937 --> 17:28.070
OVERSIGHT AND REFORM COMMITTEE

17:28.070 --> 17:29.770
HAS PASSED AWAY AT THE AGE OF

17:29.770 --> 17:35.203
68.

17:35.203 --> 17:37.804
>> EVEN AS LAWMAKERS ARE

17:37.804 --> 17:38.403
MOURNING THE PASSING OF THEIR

17:38.403 --> 17:39.770
DEAR COLLEAGUE, THIS IMPEACHMENT

17:39.770 --> 17:41.136
INQUIRY IS MOVING AHEAD THIS

17:41.136 --> 17:41.403
MORNING.

17:41.403 --> 17:43.136
>> U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE

17:43.136 --> 17:45.770
EUROPEAN UNION, GORDON SONLAND

17:45.770 --> 17:47.203
IS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE ON CAPITOL

17:47.203 --> 17:47.437
HILL.

17:47.437 --> 17:49.537
>> SONLAND WAS AT THE CENTER OF

17:49.537 --> 17:51.270
ALL THESE DELIBERATIONS AND

17:51.270 --> 17:52.136
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN ZELENSKY

17:52.136 --> 17:52.437
AND TRUMP.

17:52.437 --> 17:54.136
THE DEMOCRAT ARE GOING TO WANT

17:54.136 --> 17:56.804
TO KNOW ABOUT A SERIES OF TEXT

17:56.804 --> 17:58.570
MESSAGES BETWEEN SONLAND AND THE

17:58.570 --> 17:59.837
TOP U.S. DIPLOMAT SAYING THERE'S

17:59.837 --> 18:01.103
NO QUID PRO QUO HAPPENING

18:01.103 --> 18:03.236
BETWEEN US AND THE UKRAINIANS.

18:03.236 --> 18:04.470
WHEN HE WAS FIRST SCHEDULED TO

18:04.470 --> 18:05.737
SPEAK TO CONGRESS, THE WHITE

18:05.737 --> 18:09.170
HOUSE EFFECTIVELY SHUT IT DOWN.

18:09.170 --> 18:10.670
SO THIS IS A DEPOSITION THAT HAS

18:10.670 --> 18:11.737
BEEN WEEKS IN THE MAKING.

18:11.737 --> 18:14.236
>> CAN YOU SAY DEFINITIVE THERE

18:14.236 --> 18:16.136
WAS NO QUID PRO QUO?

18:16.136 --> 18:17.503
>> I'M NOT GIVING COMMENT UNTIL

18:17.503 --> 18:18.070
MY TESTIMONY.

18:18.070 --> 18:19.603
>> WHY WAS IT IMPORTANT TO SHOW

18:19.603 --> 18:20.704
UP HERE TODAY?

18:20.704 --> 18:22.370
>> IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO SHOW

18:22.370 --> 18:22.537
UP.

18:22.537 --> 18:25.236
>> ARE YOU HERE TO SALVAGE YOUR

18:25.236 --> 18:25.704
REPUTATION, SIR?

18:25.704 --> 18:28.003
>> EXCUSE ME.

18:28.003 --> 18:28.670
>> BREAKING NEWS, WE HAVE

18:28.670 --> 18:29.937
OBTAINED THE OPENING STATEMENT

18:29.937 --> 18:31.537
THAT GORDON SONLAND IS

18:31.537 --> 18:32.003
DELIVERING.

18:32.003 --> 18:35.003
IT PAINTS A DAMNING PICTURE.

18:35.003 --> 18:36.070
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP DIRECTED HIM

18:36.070 --> 18:36.870
TO WORK THROUGH RUDY GIULIANI

18:36.870 --> 18:45.337
WHEN IT CAME TO UKRAINE.

18:49.070 --> 18:50.537
>> WE'VE SEEN IN THIS TESTIMONY

18:50.537 --> 18:53.303
FROM OFFICIAL AFTER OFFICIAL NEW

18:53.303 --> 18:54.270
IMPLICATIONS ABOUT THE ACTING

18:54.270 --> 18:57.103
CHIEF OF STAFF, MICK MULVANEY.

18:57.103 --> 18:59.503
>> MICK MULVANEY IS SET TO

18:59.503 --> 19:00.970
BRIEF, SO HOPEFULLY A CHANCE TO

19:00.970 --> 19:04.737
ASK HIM ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

19:04.737 --> 19:07.770
>> YOU WERE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN

19:07.770 --> 19:10.670
THE DECISION TO WITHHOLD FUNDING

19:10.670 --> 19:11.103
FROM UKRAINE.

19:11.103 --> 19:13.904
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US NOW

19:13.904 --> 19:14.403
DEFINITIVELY WHY?

19:14.403 --> 19:16.170
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT A BIG

19:16.170 --> 19:17.470
FAN OF FOREIGN AID.

19:17.470 --> 19:18.670
NEVER HAS BEEN, STILL ISN'T.

19:18.670 --> 19:20.437
DOESN'T LIKE SPENDING MONEY

19:20.437 --> 19:23.203
OVERSEAS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S

19:23.203 --> 19:23.704
POORLY SPENT.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.570
I'VE BEEN IN THE OFFICE A COUPLE

19:25.570 --> 19:27.470
TIMES WITH HIM TALKING ABOUT

19:27.470 --> 19:27.670
THIS.

19:27.670 --> 19:30.136
HE SAID LOOK, MICK, THIS IS A

19:30.136 --> 19:30.603
CORRUPT PLACE.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.303
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S A CORRUPT

19:32.303 --> 19:32.503
PLACE.

19:32.503 --> 19:33.470
I DON'T WANT TO SEND THEM A

19:33.470 --> 19:34.704
BUNCH OF MONEY AND HAVE THEM

19:34.704 --> 19:36.770
WASTE IT, SPEND IT, USE IT TO

19:36.770 --> 19:38.103
LINE THEIR OWN POCKETS.

19:38.103 --> 19:39.637
THOSE ARE THE DRIVING FACTORS.

19:39.637 --> 19:42.003
DID HE ALSO MENTION TO ME IN

19:42.003 --> 19:43.103
PASS THE CORRUPTION RELATED TO

19:43.103 --> 19:44.036
THE DNC SERVER?

19:44.036 --> 19:44.337
ABSOLUTELY.

19:44.337 --> 19:46.270
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

19:46.270 --> 19:47.003
BUT THAT'S IT.

19:47.003 --> 19:48.470
THAT'S WHY WE HELD UP THE MONEY.

19:48.470 --> 19:50.003
NOW, THERE WAS A REPORT --

19:50.003 --> 19:51.637
>> SO THE DEMAND FOR AN

19:51.637 --> 19:52.670
INVESTIGATION INTO THE DEMOCRATS

19:52.670 --> 19:56.637
WAS PART OF THE REASON THAT HE

19:56.637 --> 19:57.904
WITHHELD FUNDING TO UKRAINE?

19:57.904 --> 20:00.136
>> THE LOOK BACK TO WHAT

20:00.136 --> 20:01.403
HAPPENED IN 2016 CERTAINLY WAS

20:01.403 --> 20:02.770
PART OF THE THING THAT HE WAS

20:02.770 --> 20:04.003
WORRIED ABOUT IN CORRUPTION WITH

20:04.003 --> 20:05.070
THAT NATION AND THAT IS

20:05.070 --> 20:05.837
ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE.

20:05.837 --> 20:07.470
>> TO BE CLEAR, WHAT YOU JUST

20:07.470 --> 20:08.737
DESCRIBED IS A QUID PRO QUO.

20:08.737 --> 20:10.904
>> WE DO THAT ALL THE TIME WITH

20:10.904 --> 20:13.570
FOREIGN POLICY.

20:13.570 --> 20:15.203
AND I HAVE NEWS FOR EVERYBODY,

20:15.203 --> 20:15.770
GET OVER IT.

20:15.770 --> 20:17.203
THERE'S GOING TO BE POLITICAL

20:17.203 --> 20:18.136
INFLUENCE IN FOREIGN POLICY.

20:18.136 --> 20:19.537
THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

20:19.537 --> 20:20.337
ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND

20:20.337 --> 20:22.303
FOREIGN POLICY IS GOING TO

20:22.303 --> 20:22.537
CHANGE.

20:22.537 --> 20:23.804
OBAMA DID IT IN ONE WAY.

20:23.804 --> 20:24.437
WE'RE DOING IT A DIFFERENT WAY

20:24.437 --> 20:25.003
AND THERE'S NO PROBLEM WITH

20:25.003 --> 20:28.036
THAT.

20:28.036 --> 20:29.670
>> INVESTIGATING POLITICAL

20:29.670 --> 20:30.437
OPPONENTS, ARE YOU SAYING --

20:30.437 --> 20:32.103
>> THE DNC SERVER --

20:32.103 --> 20:33.537
>> ARE YOU SAYING THAT IT'S OKAY

20:33.537 --> 20:35.837
FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO HOLD

20:35.837 --> 20:38.970
UP AID AND REQUIRE A FOREIGN

20:38.970 --> 20:39.937
GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE

20:39.937 --> 20:41.003
POLITICAL OPPONENTS?

20:41.003 --> 20:42.570
>> WAIT A SECOND.

20:42.570 --> 20:44.370
>> ARE YOU SAYING --

20:44.370 --> 20:45.804
>> HOLD ON.

20:45.804 --> 20:47.036
THERE'S AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION

20:47.036 --> 20:48.337
BY OUR DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

20:48.337 --> 20:50.603
INTO THE 2016 ELECTION.

20:50.603 --> 20:51.270
YOU'RE SAYING THE PRESIDENT OF

20:51.270 --> 20:53.203
THE UNITED STATES, THE CHIEF LAW

20:53.203 --> 20:55.403
ENFORCEMENT PERSON, CANNOT ASK

20:55.403 --> 20:57.570
SOMEBODY TO COOPERATE WITH AN

20:57.570 --> 20:58.303
ONGOING PUBLIC INVESTIGATION

20:58.303 --> 20:59.303
INTO WRONGDOING?

20:59.303 --> 21:00.236
THAT'S JUST BIZARRE TO ME THAT

21:00.236 --> 21:00.870
YOU WOULD THINK THAT YOU CAN'T

21:00.870 --> 21:05.270
DO THAT.

21:05.270 --> 21:06.070
IT'S NICE TO SEE EVERYBODY.

21:06.070 --> 21:10.970
THANKS AGAIN.

21:10.970 --> 21:14.036
>> THIS HAS BECOME THE CATCH US

21:14.036 --> 21:14.603
IF YOU CAN ADMINISTRATION.

21:14.603 --> 21:16.337
WHAT YOU HEARD FROM MICK

21:16.337 --> 21:18.303
MULVANEY, THE ACTING CHIEF OF

21:18.303 --> 21:19.804
STAFF, A FEW MOMENTS AGO WAS

21:19.804 --> 21:20.603
MIND BLOWING.

21:20.603 --> 21:21.670
>> ALL BUT ACKNOWLEDGED WHAT

21:21.670 --> 21:24.503
APPEARS TO BE SOME TYPE OF QUID

21:24.503 --> 21:25.870
PRO QUO FOR HOLDING UP MILITARY

21:25.870 --> 21:26.670
AID.

21:26.670 --> 21:28.370
HE WAS ASKED DIRECTLY.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.704
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TOP AID

21:29.704 --> 21:31.570
JUST CONTRADICTED PRESIDENT

21:31.570 --> 21:31.770
TRUMP.

21:31.770 --> 21:34.470
>> MICK MULVANEY WENT OUT THERE

21:34.470 --> 21:35.570
AND ESSENTIALLY SET HIMSELF ON

21:35.570 --> 21:36.837
FIRE ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.136
>> ONE SENIOR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

21:38.136 --> 21:39.870
OFFICIAL SAID, QUOTE, IF THE

21:39.870 --> 21:41.036
WHITE HOUSE WAS WITHHOLDING AID

21:42.470 --> 21:43.136
ANY INVESTIGATION AT THE JUSTICE

21:59.203 --> 22:00.070
>> YEAH.

22:00.070 --> 22:02.403
WELL, NO, I DIDN'T MAKE IT TO

22:02.403 --> 22:04.203
LOUISIANA BECAUSE OF CANCELLED

22:04.203 --> 22:07.503
FLIGHTS.

22:07.503 --> 22:09.770
>> NEWS EVENT OF THE DAY, CHIEF

22:11.670 --> 22:13.704
THERE WAS A QUID PRO QUO.

22:13.704 --> 22:14.670
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAID.

22:14.670 --> 22:15.470
>> WHAT DID HE SAY?

22:15.470 --> 22:17.203
>> NOTHING THAT THE CHIEF OF

22:17.203 --> 22:18.570
STAFF SAID TODAY IS NEW

22:18.570 --> 22:19.070
INFORMATION.

22:19.070 --> 22:20.937
WE'VE ALL SEEN THE TRANSCRIPT OF

22:20.937 --> 22:21.470
THE PHONE CALL.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.370
THERE'S NOTHING IN THAT PHONE

22:23.370 --> 22:24.236
CALL THAT INVOLVES --

22:24.236 --> 22:27.303
>> I THINK HE SAID WE DID HOLD

22:27.303 --> 22:28.670
UP MONEY FOR A POLITICAL REASON.

22:28.670 --> 22:29.837
>> THAT HAS ALSO BEEN --

22:29.837 --> 22:32.337
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID THERE'S NO

22:32.337 --> 22:32.704
QUID PRO QUO.

22:32.704 --> 22:33.303
>> HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

22:33.303 --> 22:35.804
>> HOLDING UP AID IN EXCHANGE

22:35.804 --> 22:37.737
FOR PROMISING TO DIG UP DIRT --

22:37.737 --> 22:39.337
>> THE AID WAS HELD UP BECAUSE

22:39.337 --> 22:40.503
OF CORRUPTION IN THE UKRAINE.

22:40.503 --> 22:42.370
NONE OF THIS IS NEW INFORMATION.

22:42.370 --> 22:43.036
>> WELL --

22:43.036 --> 22:45.070
>> THIS IS JUST THE MEDIA

22:45.070 --> 22:45.704
HYPERVENTILATING AGAIN BECAUSE

THEY CAN'T WAIT TO GET THIS

22:46.270 --> 22:47.704
PRESIDENT.

22:47.704 --> 22:50.937

22:51.770 --> 22:53.470
SUPPORTERS FEEL ABOUT THIS

22:53.470 --> 22:55.403
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS?

22:55.403 --> 22:56.603
POLITICALLY HOW DOES THIS PLAY

22:56.603 --> 22:59.103
FOR YOU?

22:59.103 --> 23:00.503
>> THE IMPEACHMENT ISSUE HAS THE

23:00.503 --> 23:01.570
PRESIDENT'S SUPPORTERS FIRED UP.

23:01.570 --> 23:03.637
THEY'RE MORE ENGAGED IF IT WAS

23:03.637 --> 23:05.370
EVEN POSSIBLE THAN THEY WERE

23:05.370 --> 23:05.603
BEFORE.

23:05.603 --> 23:09.637
WHAT YOU HAVE HERE, THIS IS NOT

23:09.637 --> 23:09.970
THE CONGRESS.

23:09.970 --> 23:12.704
THIS IS NOS T THE HOUSE OF

23:12.704 --> 23:14.737
REPRESENTATIVES ENGAGED IN AN

23:14.737 --> 23:15.437
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY.

23:15.437 --> 23:16.737
THIS IS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

23:16.737 --> 23:17.804
>> YOU THINK THIS IS A POLITICAL

23:17.804 --> 23:18.704
PLUS FOR THE PRESIDENT?

23:18.704 --> 23:20.136
>> THERE'S A REASON WHY NANCY

23:20.136 --> 23:21.737
PELOSI TOOK AS LONG AS SHE DID.

23:21.737 --> 23:23.303
SHE HELD IT OFF AS LONG AS SHE

23:23.303 --> 23:24.603
COULD AND THERE'S A REASON WHY

23:24.603 --> 23:25.937
SHE WON'T CALL FOR A FORMAL

23:25.937 --> 23:26.804
VOTE.

23:26.804 --> 23:27.904
ONE, SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTES.

23:27.904 --> 23:30.070
AND TWO, SHE KNOWS IT WOULD BE

23:30.070 --> 23:30.704
DAMAGING TO HER MAJORITY IF SHE

23:30.704 --> 23:33.370
ALLOWED THAT.

23:33.370 --> 23:37.070
>> THE RADICAL LEFT HAS

23:37.070 --> 23:38.003
ABSOLUTELY NO RESPECT FOR THE

23:38.003 --> 23:41.103
WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

23:41.103 --> 23:43.403
THEY COME AFTER ME, BUT WHAT

23:43.403 --> 23:45.537
THEY'RE REALLY DOING IS THEY'RE

23:45.537 --> 23:46.937
COMING AFTER THE REPUBLICAN

23:46.937 --> 23:48.537
PARTY AND WHAT THEY'RE REALLY,

23:48.537 --> 23:51.537
REALLY DOING IS THEY'RE COMING

23:51.537 --> 23:52.170
AFTER AND FIGHTING YOU, AND WE

23:52.170 --> 23:53.737
NEVER LOSE.

24:08.837 --> 24:10.103
>>> YESTERDAY MICK MULVANEY WENT

24:10.103 --> 24:11.403
IN FRONT OF THE PRESS AND SAID,

24:11.403 --> 24:13.870
OH YEAH, QUID PRO QUO, WE DO

24:13.870 --> 24:14.904
QUID PRO QUO'S ALL THE TIME.

24:14.904 --> 24:16.970
OF COURSE WE DID A PRESIDE

24:16.970 --> 24:17.203
PROQUO.

24:17.203 --> 24:20.337
THE REACTION WAS SO BAD ON

24:20.337 --> 24:22.136
TRUMP'S OWN LEGAL TEAM THAT

24:22.136 --> 24:24.804
MULVANEY SENT OUT A RETRACTION

24:24.804 --> 24:25.870
ABOUT TWO HOURS LATER SAYING, OH

24:25.870 --> 24:27.203
YEAH, ALL THAT STUFF I JUST

24:27.203 --> 24:29.704
SAID, FORGET ABOUT IT.

24:29.704 --> 24:31.370
WE'RE GOING TO GET SOME MORE

24:31.370 --> 24:35.770
PERSPECTIVE WITH PAUL ROSEN ZAG.

24:35.770 --> 24:37.870
HE'S A VERY CONSERVATIVE GUY WHO

24:37.870 --> 24:39.637
WAS ESSENTIALLY KEN STARR'S

24:39.637 --> 24:41.136
DEPUTY THE LAST TIME THERE WAS

24:41.136 --> 24:43.704
AN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IN

24:43.704 --> 24:44.337
WASHINGTON D.C.

24:44.337 --> 24:45.403
YOU THOUGHT BILL CLINTON SHOULD

24:45.403 --> 24:46.370
BE IMPEACHED?

24:46.370 --> 24:46.603
>> YES.

24:46.603 --> 24:47.437
I WOULD HAVE VOTED TO CONVICT

24:47.437 --> 24:48.737
HIM AND REMOVE HIM FROM OFFICE.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.670
>> YOU THOUGHT SINCE MUELLER

24:50.670 --> 24:51.637
THAT TRUMP SHOULD BE IMPEACHED

24:51.637 --> 24:52.570
AND REMOVED FROM OFFICE?

24:52.570 --> 24:54.804
>> YES, AT LEAST SINCE THEN.

24:54.804 --> 24:56.770
>> IN OUR POLARIZED TIMES, THERE

24:56.770 --> 24:58.704
ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT BILL

24:58.704 --> 24:59.637
CLINTON SHOULD BE IMPEACHED AND

24:59.637 --> 25:00.970
THROWN OUT OF OFFICE AND MANY

25:00.970 --> 25:02.870
THAT THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP

25:02.870 --> 25:05.603
SHOULD BE IMPEACHED AND THROWN

25:05.603 --> 25:07.203
OUT OF OFFICE.

25:07.203 --> 25:08.837
THE DIAGRAM OF THAT IS NOT

25:08.837 --> 25:09.070
LARGE.

25:09.070 --> 25:10.870
>> IT IS A VERY SMALL SLIVER OF

25:10.870 --> 25:11.337
THE WORLD.

25:11.337 --> 25:12.370
I HAVE BEEN A CONSERVATIVE MUCH

25:12.370 --> 25:14.203
OF MY LIFE BECAUSE I BELIEVED IN

25:14.203 --> 25:15.837
THINGS LIKE INTELLECTUAL HONESTY

25:15.837 --> 25:16.670
OR CONSISTENCY.

25:16.670 --> 25:18.136
FOR ME, IF YOU HAVE A POSITION

25:18.136 --> 25:21.370
AND YOU COME TO IT FOR A REASON,

25:21.370 --> 25:22.970
RIGHT, THEN THE RIGHT THING TO

25:22.970 --> 25:24.136
DO IS TO STICK WITH IT.

25:24.136 --> 25:27.403
OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

25:27.403 --> 25:30.437
DISAPPOINTED ME IN THIS ARE THE

25:30.437 --> 25:32.270
REPUBLICANS WHO WERE ALL FOR

25:32.270 --> 25:34.437
IMPEACHING BILL CLINTON AND NOW

25:34.437 --> 25:35.670
WON'T WALK THE TALK AND TALK THE

25:35.670 --> 25:39.136
TALK FOR TRUMP.

25:39.136 --> 25:43.203
>> THE SONDLAND TESTIMONY

25:43.203 --> 25:44.737
YESTERDAY MADE SOMETHING CLEAR.

25:44.737 --> 25:46.103
HE'S A BIG DONOR FOR DONALD

25:46.103 --> 25:46.537
TRUMP.

25:46.537 --> 25:48.070
HE ESSENTIALLY PUTS TRUMP IN THE

25:48.070 --> 25:48.670
MIDDLE OF THE THING.

25:48.670 --> 25:50.270
>> THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT THING

25:50.270 --> 25:53.036
ABOUT SONDLAND'S TESTIMONY, HE

25:53.036 --> 25:54.337
WAS THE FIRST THAT I KNOW OF

25:54.337 --> 25:56.670
TRUE TRUMP LOYALIST WHO

25:56.670 --> 25:57.236
ABANDONED SHIP.

25:57.236 --> 25:59.103
SO THAT'S KIND OF SIGNIFICANT.

25:59.103 --> 26:01.003
IF HE'S THE FIRST OF MANY, THEN

26:01.003 --> 26:06.136
THE WALLS CRUMBLE.

26:06.136 --> 26:07.904
>> HAS TRUMP'S POSITION WORSENED

26:07.904 --> 26:10.603
IN THE LAST FIVE DAYS?

26:10.603 --> 26:12.770
>> I'D ANSWER THIS WAY.

26:12.770 --> 26:14.603
IMPEACHMENT AND TRIAL, THOUGH

26:14.603 --> 26:17.837
THEY ARE BOUND BY LAW, ARE

26:17.837 --> 26:18.737
FUNDAMENTALLY POLITICAL

26:18.737 --> 26:20.403
QUESTIONS IN WHICH THE VIEWS OF

26:20.403 --> 26:22.470
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC REALLY ARE

26:22.470 --> 26:23.437
EXPRESSED THROUGH THEIR

26:23.437 --> 26:25.670
REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS,

26:25.670 --> 26:28.503
AND WE TRY AND REACH A RESULT.

26:28.503 --> 26:29.337
WE'RE AT THAT MOMENT WHERE

26:29.337 --> 26:30.704
EITHER WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT

26:30.704 --> 26:33.870
TURN BACK UPWARDS AND TRUMP WILL

26:33.870 --> 26:36.203
SURVIVE OR TRUMP'S POPULARITY

26:36.203 --> 26:39.203
WILL CONTINUE ITS DESCENT DOWN

26:39.203 --> 26:39.603
THAT WAY.

26:39.603 --> 26:40.870
>> IS THERE A WAY IN WHICH TRUMP

26:40.870 --> 26:43.003
BY DOING ALL THIS IN PLAIN SIGHT

26:43.003 --> 26:44.403
AND BASICALLY LIKE OBVIOUSLY

26:44.403 --> 26:45.303
IT'S NOT WRONG BECAUSE I'M

26:45.303 --> 26:46.470
TELLING YOU ABOUT IT, IS THERE A

26:46.470 --> 26:47.570
WAY WHERE THAT COULD BE THE

26:47.570 --> 26:50.704
THING THAT SAVES HIM?

26:50.704 --> 26:51.737
>> YES.

26:51.737 --> 26:54.203
BETWEEN THE OPENNESS OF WHAT HE

26:54.203 --> 26:57.704
DOES AND THE WAY IN WHICH HE'S

26:57.704 --> 27:01.337
BECOME ALMOST A SUPERHERO TO HIS

27:01.337 --> 27:03.837
BASE WHICH MAKES THE -- CAN'T BE

27:03.837 --> 27:05.670
WRONG IF I'M DOING IT IN THE

27:05.670 --> 27:08.170
OPEN MORE SELLABLE, IF HE

27:08.170 --> 27:10.170
SURVIVES IT WILL BE BECAUSE 35%

27:10.170 --> 27:15.403
OF THE AMERICAN POPULOUS, 90% OF

27:15.403 --> 27:18.570
WHAT'S LEFT OF THE REPUBLICAN

27:18.570 --> 27:20.437
PARTY POPULOUS CLEARLY LOST THE

27:20.437 --> 27:22.570
SYMPATHY OF THE GENERAL POPULOUS

27:22.570 --> 27:24.203
AND THAT'S WHEN HE WOUND UP

27:24.203 --> 27:24.637
GOING.

27:24.637 --> 27:25.470
CLINTON MANAGED TO CONVINCE

27:25.470 --> 27:26.937
PEOPLE THAT LYING ABOUT SEX WAS

27:26.937 --> 27:31.737
NOT IMPORTANT.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.737
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK

27:33.737 --> 27:35.570
PEOPLE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND

27:35.570 --> 27:38.136
IS THAT EACH OF THESE

27:38.136 --> 27:40.337
IMPEACHMENTS SETS A NORM FOR THE

27:40.337 --> 27:41.070
NEXT ONE.

27:41.070 --> 27:44.070
WE NOW KNOW THAT LYING ABOUT SEX

27:44.070 --> 27:45.937
IS NOT A REMOVABLE OFFENSE.

27:45.937 --> 27:47.070
NOBODY WILL EVER TRY IT AGAIN.

27:47.070 --> 27:48.870
IF IT REALLY TURNS OUT TO BE THE

27:48.870 --> 27:50.737
CASE THAT HOLDING UP FOREIGN AID

27:50.737 --> 27:51.937
FOR DIRT ON YOUR POLITICAL

27:51.937 --> 27:53.403
OPPONENT IS NOT A REMOVABLE

27:53.403 --> 27:55.437
OFFENSE, WE'RE GOING TO BE IN A

27:55.437 --> 27:56.670
PLACE WHERE THE FOREIGN POLICY

27:56.670 --> 27:57.737
OF THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO

27:57.737 --> 27:59.403
LOOK VERY DIFFERENT IN THE

27:59.403 --> 28:01.337
FUTURE AND OUR MORAL STANDING IN

28:01.337 --> 28:04.136
THE WORLD IS GOING TO BE VERY

28:04.136 --> 28:04.437
DIFFERENT.

28:04.437 --> 28:05.337
>> ANARCHY IS LOOSE UPON THE

28:05.337 --> 28:09.103
WORLD.
