WEBVTT

00:29.028 --> 00:37.869
Shh...

00:37.871 --> 00:38.913
Did we get it?

00:43.417 --> 00:44.710
- We did it!
- Hey!

00:52.051 --> 00:53.344
Turn around...

00:53.386 --> 00:54.721
Look at the camera!

00:57.307 --> 02:02.369
Hey, hey, hey... wait! Wait...

02:02.371 --> 02:03.373
Tots?

02:05.332 --> 02:06.334
Beans?

02:12.298 --> 02:16.675
Okay.

02:16.677 --> 02:19.137
Shaw. Didn't you notice?

02:19.139 --> 02:20.807
- Yeah...
- You're acting different.

02:22.057 --> 02:23.143
You alright, man?

02:58.344 --> 02:59.596
No.

03:00.347 --> 03:01.514
Mommy.

03:01.889 --> 03:02.848
Mommy.

03:02.890 --> 03:03.849
Mommy.

03:03.891 --> 03:04.850
Mommy.

03:04.893 --> 03:05.852
Mommy.

03:05.894 --> 03:06.853
Mommy.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.147
Mommy.

03:09.188 --> 03:17.197
Mommy!

03:33.045 --> 03:34.046
Mom?

03:52.314 --> 03:53.608
Ma'am!

03:59.406 --> 04:00.824
Prominence Bank.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.122
I need your attention.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.913
Your attention please.

04:09.915 --> 04:11.126
Carl, sit down.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.920
Mary-Alice, turn around.

04:15.587 --> 04:16.923
Your attention!

04:18.091 --> 04:19.466
Eyes up here.

04:19.509 --> 04:23.388
Those of you that will be
missing school next week...

04:23.430 --> 04:25.098
...to go hunting,

04:25.348 --> 04:28.225
need to have this permission
slip form signed,

04:28.267 --> 04:29.643
and returned to me...

04:29.685 --> 04:33.437
tomorrow afternoon at
the very latest.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.774
Those that don't return
their forms...

04:36.192 --> 04:37.276
Shaw.

04:37.317 --> 04:39.278
Shaw!

04:39.319 --> 04:41.488
Hey.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.781
You fell asleep.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.117
...all of your classroom work,
and homework...

04:46.119 --> 04:47.287
must be completed.

05:31.497 --> 05:42.005
Hey, come on, move!

05:42.007 --> 05:43.133
Hey!

05:43.175 --> 05:44.176
Stop!

05:45.177 --> 05:46.137
Hey!

05:46.178 --> 05:47.763
I'm sorry...

06:12.747 --> 06:14.749
Uh... yeah.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.713
Yeah, this is William Templeton.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.057
Oh...

07:10.846 --> 07:12.473
Take your time.

07:12.514 --> 07:14.141
I'll be right outside.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.824
There any other surviving
family members?

08:14.661 --> 08:16.329
Well, my mom...

08:16.370 --> 08:17.871
Shaw's grandmom.

08:19.874 --> 08:23.336
She, uh... lives in Erie.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.798
I haven't talked to her in
years.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.424
Her choice, not mine.

08:31.093 --> 08:33.429
What kinda relationship do
you have with Shaw?

08:34.556 --> 08:37.017
Well after Karen and I
got separated...

08:38.726 --> 08:42.062
she didn't want me around, so I
didn't see him much.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.944
You mind me askin' the reason
for the separation?

08:48.861 --> 08:52.197
Didn't get along was
the main reason.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.456
Then I had a drinkin' problem,
that didn't help any.

09:03.375 --> 09:05.044
Still have a drinkin' problem?

09:05.086 --> 09:07.212
Two and a half years,
clean and sober.

09:07.589 --> 09:09.796
Never felt better.

09:09.798 --> 09:11.717
I'm gonna have to be
frank with you.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.135
I'm concerned...

09:14.053 --> 09:15.387
about Shaw's welfare.

09:16.764 --> 09:19.016
A 15-year-old boy found
his mother's body...

09:19.058 --> 09:27.647
and was alone with it for
a day and a half.

09:27.649 --> 09:29.735
Now, I don't know if you wanna,
you know...

09:29.778 --> 09:33.072
pair him up with a therapist or
something, I don't know.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.117
Alright...

09:40.788 --> 09:42.915
We're gonna release you now,
okay?

09:44.500 --> 09:46.168
Yeah? Alright.

09:46.251 --> 09:48.003
Go home and get some sleep.

09:52.591 --> 10:00.931
Go ahead.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.101
Hey...

10:29.169 --> 10:37.634
You wanna talk about it?

10:37.636 --> 10:52.190
Can if you want.

10:52.192 --> 10:53.569
...very evil stuff.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.407
And I got... enraged. I looked
at him as a man...

10:59.325 --> 11:01.745
...as a scumbag, as an enemy of
humanity, and all my genetics said,

11:01.827 --> 11:03.871
that's the enemy.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.623
And so I wanted to come on air
and really tell you what I

11:05.664 --> 11:08.668
thinkabout it.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.171
I don't... because
he's a predator!

11:17.844 --> 11:19.346
You remember Patton?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.557
Well, he's big now.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.190
Who's that?

11:31.066 --> 11:32.359
Who's that?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.235
I don't think he remembers you.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.725
Hey!

12:06.768 --> 12:08.519
Hey!

12:08.561 --> 12:09.896
Can you help me with this?

12:16.152 --> 12:17.112
Where do you want it?

12:17.153 --> 12:19.778
I don't know...

12:19.780 --> 12:21.073
Over here. Over here.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.244
No. Actually... let's
go over here.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.332
Just set it here for now.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.421
What's it for?

12:34.837 --> 12:38.756
Well, this is just for a
little while, until...

12:38.758 --> 12:40.093
You expect me to sleep on it?

12:41.177 --> 12:42.678
Well, it's not that bad.

12:43.303 --> 12:44.805
You know, just, uh...

12:44.847 --> 12:45.848
No.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.642
What... are you
worried about this?

12:47.683 --> 12:49.144
Yeah.

12:49.184 --> 12:52.062
It's just a water stain. I'm
gonna put the sheet over it.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.731
You won't even know it's there.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.815
Then you sleep on it.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.235
Well, this is your bed.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.572
No. I'm not doing it. I'm not
sleeping on this shitty cot,

13:00.613 --> 13:02.741
in this shitty house.
I'm not doing it.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.160
It's what we've got, alright?
You're gonna have to

13:05.201 --> 13:06.827
deal with it.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.127
What are you, tough?

13:14.961 --> 13:16.337
What?

13:16.546 --> 13:18.465
You're some kind of a bad-ass?

13:19.883 --> 13:21.301
Is that it?

13:25.971 --> 13:28.723
I didn't have to keep you.

13:28.725 --> 13:29.725
Okay?

13:30.684 --> 13:33.479
I can give you back
anytime I want.

13:35.981 --> 13:42.697
As long as you stay under this
roof, you treat me with respect.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.700
So check that shitty attitude
right at the door.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.241
Or I'll end it.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.703
Right fucking now.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.704
You got it?

13:51.706 --> 13:52.706
Yes.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.209
Yes, sir.

13:54.668 --> 13:55.668
Yes, sir.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.229
Sleep well?

14:19.900 --> 14:21.527
Did you get a haircut?

14:23.529 --> 14:24.530
No.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.619
Handsome boy.

14:49.639 --> 14:50.639
Thank you.

15:25.091 --> 15:30.844
Dad.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.264
Dad!

15:36.811 --> 15:39.439
I need to get some stuff
from mom's house.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.858
What time is it?

15:44.860 --> 15:45.944
Um, I don't know.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.951
Flea market opens in a
couple hours...

15:52.994 --> 15:54.620
Why do you have my phone?

15:56.373 --> 15:58.541
I'm sorry, is this your phone?

16:00.125 --> 16:02.294
You pay the bill for it?

16:03.004 --> 16:03.962
Hm?

16:04.004 --> 16:05.631
Come on, come on, I need it.

16:06.548 --> 16:08.425
Well if you don't pay the bill,
it's not really

16:08.467 --> 16:10.469
your phone, is it?

16:17.976 --> 16:19.978
Don't forget to look
in the truck!

16:26.235 --> 16:29.655
My main strategy for finding
big bucks is to hunt the does.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.951
...locate where the does are
feeding and bedding

16:32.991 --> 16:34.451
during the rut.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.452
If there are good
bucks in the area,

16:35.495 --> 16:38.539
it's just a matter of putting
in your time to get a

16:38.581 --> 16:39.581
look at one.

16:39.666 --> 16:40.709
I'd scouted a ton.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.502
So I was ready...

17:27.212 --> 17:28.339
What are you doing?

17:28.381 --> 17:30.050
Setting up, Walt.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.718
- You do not have this stall
reserved.

17:31.759 --> 17:32.885
-Now hang on, hang on.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.055
It's my bad. Alright?
Are we cool?

17:36.096 --> 17:37.766
Huh? Are we good?

17:38.767 --> 17:39.768
Go on.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.394
Fucking degenerate.

17:43.145 --> 17:56.740
Thank you, Walter.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.412
When are we gonna have a
funeral for mom?

18:00.747 --> 18:02.664
I haven't thought
that far ahead.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.541
Lot to do.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.503
Shouldn't we be making
arrangements?

18:11.090 --> 18:18.429
You got cigarettes?

18:18.431 --> 18:21.601
Can't put my life on hold just
'cause... You got a light?

18:27.981 --> 18:29.942
Just 'cause a few things change,
you know?

18:31.277 --> 18:35.654
We're gonna have a funeral
though, right?

18:35.656 --> 18:36.990
Hey!

18:37.032 --> 18:38.158
Take a walk. Go on.

18:38.201 --> 18:39.285
Where?

18:39.326 --> 18:40.619
Go on.

18:45.208 --> 18:48.209
- Is that Shaw?
- Yeah.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.130
Thought he didn't visit
with you no more.

18:50.171 --> 18:51.631
Well, he does now.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.555
Oh, man.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.521
So he's gonna live with you now?

19:51.066 --> 19:52.692
I don't know...

19:53.108 --> 19:55.861
I mean, I hadn't talked to
her for... for months.

19:55.903 --> 19:56.904
Except once.

19:58.573 --> 19:59.865
I guess it just...

20:00.282 --> 20:01.784
snuck up on her.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.912
Man, I'm sorry.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.372
But...

20:05.413 --> 20:10.458
I guess it's good at least
you divorced her.

20:10.460 --> 20:13.460
I mean, well, think about it.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.713
You'd be stuck with
all her debt...

20:15.714 --> 20:18.300
and you don't owe her
anything anymore.

20:18.384 --> 20:19.760
Right?

20:20.386 --> 20:22.971
Maybe you'll finally take off
that damn ring.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.611
Hey!

20:38.613 --> 20:41.780
What are you doing here, faggot?

20:41.782 --> 20:43.117
Yeah, go around him.

20:44.911 --> 20:45.912
Shaw!

20:47.913 --> 20:48.914
Shaw!

20:49.415 --> 20:50.914
Hey!

20:50.916 --> 20:51.875
Yeah.

20:51.917 --> 20:52.918
Grab his cigarettes.

20:54.837 --> 20:57.298
What's your problem, asshole?
Why so fucking rude?

20:57.339 --> 20:58.465
Get the fuck off me!

20:58.508 --> 20:59.467
Stop!

20:59.509 --> 21:00.634
Stop!

21:00.676 --> 21:03.429
- Give them back, you stupid hick!
- Settle down!

21:03.471 --> 21:04.431
Hey, hey, hey...

21:04.471 --> 21:05.514
Hillbilly piece of shit.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.933
Whoa, what's the problem here,
killer?

21:08.351 --> 21:09.978
- Stop!
- Dad!

21:11.479 --> 21:12.939
Is that Shaw?

21:12.980 --> 21:14.106
Let me go!

21:14.148 --> 21:15.441
You calm?

21:15.482 --> 21:16.775
I didn't do anything.

21:17.527 --> 21:18.778
What's going on?

21:19.612 --> 21:21.781
These fucking
rednecks jumped me.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.867
This your boy, Will?

21:25.035 --> 21:26.411
Yeah.

21:26.452 --> 21:31.788
Keep him on a leash, will ya?

21:31.790 --> 21:34.793
You let that little faggot get
the best of you?

21:59.527 --> 22:00.987
Here.

23:40.670 --> 23:41.671
Did we get it?

23:41.755 --> 23:43.089
I don't know.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.096
Your dad got right on him.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.097
I'll be damned.

23:54.851 --> 24:20.624
How many points you got?

24:20.626 --> 24:23.126
Shaw!

24:23.128 --> 25:00.832
Take what you need, I
don't have all day!

25:00.834 --> 25:35.365
I'm up. Okay.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.368
What does it say?

25:42.709 --> 25:49.796
Dad!

25:49.798 --> 25:51.050
Dad.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.557
Is it about mom's funeral?

25:59.808 --> 26:01.019
Yeah.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.895
Four grand for a casket.

27:24.978 --> 27:26.645
- You with the family?
- Um...

27:26.688 --> 27:29.024
- The wake's not till five...
- I'm here about my mom?

27:29.065 --> 27:30.482
Karen Templeton?

27:31.067 --> 27:33.028
Did you come by yourself?
You're gonna need an adult...

27:33.068 --> 27:35.238
- Yeah, but I can...
- You gotta get an adult.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.531
- No, I can...
- Come back with your father.

27:38.324 --> 27:39.659
But my mom is here, right?

27:39.701 --> 27:42.287
You gotta talk to your father
about that. I can't help you.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.747
Sorry!

28:23.744 --> 29:05.910
- That it?
- Yeah.

29:05.912 --> 29:06.871
Hey!

29:06.913 --> 29:07.913
Shaw!

29:09.624 --> 29:10.750
What?

29:10.791 --> 29:11.875
What're you doing?

29:11.917 --> 29:13.168
Nothing.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.131
What's that?

29:18.133 --> 29:19.174
It's not mine.

29:19.259 --> 29:20.842
You got more of 'em?

29:20.844 --> 29:21.928
No.

29:21.970 --> 29:24.431
Hey, keep lying to me,
see what happens.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.770
Where'd you get these?

29:33.772 --> 29:35.190
Stole 'em from my dad.

29:40.279 --> 29:43.365
- How's everything at home?
- Sucks, what do you think?

29:45.160 --> 29:46.786
Your dad treatin' you alright?

29:46.827 --> 29:51.956
No. He's an asshole.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.500
Alright.

29:53.542 --> 29:56.587
The funeral director called us
'cause you been out here.

29:56.628 --> 29:57.629
So...

29:58.006 --> 30:59.606
Don't hang out here no more.

30:59.608 --> 31:00.818
Like Santa.

31:00.859 --> 31:01.860
Yeah.

31:01.903 --> 31:03.070
I'm Santa.

31:03.113 --> 31:04.072
You want a present?

31:04.114 --> 31:06.365
- Yeah, I do. I deserve it.
- Yeah?

31:07.241 --> 31:09.201
Are you here by yourself?

31:09.952 --> 31:11.745
Will. She loves me.

31:14.457 --> 31:15.542
John.

31:17.126 --> 31:18.377
She's a whore.

31:21.131 --> 31:22.548
Just sayin'.

31:22.882 --> 31:23.883
I don't give a shit.

31:26.219 --> 31:28.304
Are you in, or not?

31:29.055 --> 31:31.805
No... I don't know.

31:31.807 --> 31:32.975
Come on. Come on!

31:33.058 --> 31:34.601
I can't! Come on, I...

31:34.644 --> 31:36.893
It's too much!

31:36.895 --> 31:39.646
What?

31:39.648 --> 31:41.066
What?

31:41.108 --> 31:42.568
What's with you?

31:42.609 --> 31:44.319
No, no, no. What's with you?

31:44.612 --> 31:46.031
Me?

31:46.071 --> 31:48.407
Yeah, you're acting weird
and you know it, right?

31:48.450 --> 32:45.671
You're acting weird.

32:45.673 --> 32:46.840
Oooooo...

32:57.352 --> 32:58.812
Oh, what the...

33:06.027 --> 33:07.319
Jesus.

33:49.237 --> 33:52.032
It's $250 for both at once.

33:52.073 --> 33:53.199
Uh, no.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.616
One at a time.

33:57.244 --> 33:58.370
I ain't got that kinda money.

33:59.247 --> 34:01.082
I'll cover you, pay
me back later.

34:01.124 --> 34:02.125
I can't.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.335
John!

34:03.375 --> 34:06.296
Come on, it's not like your
ex is gonna find out.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.546
I don't wanna do this.

34:07.588 --> 34:09.798
What are you... this is gonna
be good for you.

34:09.882 --> 34:11.717
- I'm doing this for you.
- Who's up first?

34:11.760 --> 34:13.178
- Let's just leave.
- Go around.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.762
We ain't goin' nowhere.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.141
Watch out.

34:18.224 --> 34:19.601
Here.

34:20.226 --> 34:21.644
Alright.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.592
You're up.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.470
No...

34:56.304 --> 34:57.931
Already paid.

34:59.014 --> 35:01.264
I don't care.

35:01.266 --> 35:04.936
You're full of shit.

35:04.938 --> 35:05.896
Did you...

35:05.938 --> 35:07.940
Did you ever even get a divorce?

35:12.445 --> 35:14.114
It's true, isn't it?

35:17.199 --> 35:18.826
You're still married.

35:22.288 --> 35:25.331
You're a bad fucking liar.

35:25.333 --> 35:27.876
So what happened to that
money I lent you?

35:30.338 --> 35:31.339
Fuck.

35:31.505 --> 35:32.923
You said...

35:32.965 --> 35:36.094
You told me you needed a few
grand to buy Karen out,

35:36.135 --> 35:39.014
so you wouldn't have
to pay alimony.

35:45.853 --> 35:46.855
Shit!

35:51.192 --> 35:52.318
There we go.

35:52.360 --> 35:53.528
Fuck that shit!

37:59.320 --> 38:00.989
Pass that back, please.

38:13.460 --> 38:14.668
Hey, Robbie.

38:14.710 --> 38:16.128
Hey, Robbie.

38:16.295 --> 38:18.172
- Little shit.
- Stop!

38:21.175 --> 38:36.313
Faggot.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.398
Get out of my way.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.360
Why?

38:39.402 --> 38:41.653
I don't have time for
your bullshit.

38:42.530 --> 38:43.990
Move!

38:44.824 --> 38:46.990
Get the fuck out of my way!

38:46.992 --> 38:48.202
Give me your wallet.

38:53.333 --> 38:54.501
Huh?

38:54.541 --> 38:56.251
Get the fuck off me!

38:56.920 --> 38:57.878
I'll kill you.

38:57.920 --> 38:58.879
Gimme your wallet.

38:58.922 --> 39:00.423
- No.
- Gimme your fucking wallet.

39:00.507 --> 39:41.295
No, get the... get off me!

39:41.297 --> 39:45.383
Hand 'em out, boy.

39:45.385 --> 39:46.883
Shaw! Hey, hey!

39:46.885 --> 39:47.887
Shaw.

39:48.471 --> 39:49.889
Hey, uh...

39:51.557 --> 39:53.059
I'm sorry about your mom.

39:55.269 --> 39:57.061
I gotta go.

39:57.063 --> 39:58.023
Robbie!

39:58.063 --> 41:05.796
Oh. Bye!

41:05.798 --> 41:07.592
- Give me my wallet.
- No.

41:07.634 --> 41:08.760
Just give it to me!

41:08.802 --> 41:09.803
Give me my wallet!

41:10.637 --> 41:12.013
Hey, what's going on?

41:14.516 --> 41:16.017
Let his wallet alone!

41:19.478 --> 41:24.481
Give me my wallet!

41:24.483 --> 41:26.360
Fuck you. Fuck you!

41:26.402 --> 41:27.486
Get outta here!

46:00.969 --> 46:02.262
Mom, I'm back!

46:19.987 --> 46:21.280
Mom?

46:41.634 --> 46:42.635
Mom?

46:51.894 --> 46:53.146
Mom?

47:56.583 --> 47:57.585
Mom?

48:01.922 --> 48:03.215
Mom...

48:04.050 --> 48:05.719
What should I do?

48:08.722 --> 48:09.764
You need to...

48:10.139 --> 48:11.724
You gotta get up.

48:12.391 --> 48:13.893
I... I gotta go to school.

48:20.108 --> 48:21.568
I'll be back, mom!

48:35.081 --> 48:36.291
Okay...

48:39.501 --> 48:41.462
Shaw... didn't you notice?

48:43.088 --> 48:44.757
You're acting different.

48:44.798 --> 48:45.800
You alright, man?

49:24.005 --> 49:25.090
Jesus!

49:25.130 --> 49:26.382
All our stuff is gone!

49:27.132 --> 49:28.342
What's going on?

49:35.016 --> 49:36.309
I'm selling the house.

49:36.893 --> 49:37.976
No!

49:38.018 --> 49:39.395
...deal with you...!

49:55.327 --> 49:56.829
What about my bike?

49:58.664 --> 49:59.833
Fuck!

50:03.003 --> 50:04.129
I'm tired of your shit.

50:04.170 --> 50:06.047
I'm takin' you back.

50:06.088 --> 50:09.342
...whoever has the CIA's
archives can take advantage

50:09.384 --> 50:10.342
the whole...

50:10.385 --> 50:13.555
...CIA open, and hack
into your personal things...

50:13.596 --> 50:14.972
But think about the people that
use iPhones,

50:15.014 --> 50:17.224
in the business world.

50:17.266 --> 50:19.351
Does it make you feel safe
that the people that...

50:19.393 --> 50:21.353
organize our infrastructure...

50:21.396 --> 50:23.981
our business secrets, our
technology secrets, our

50:24.023 --> 50:24.982
military secrets,

50:25.025 --> 50:28.153
our political secrets, finance
secrets...

50:28.193 --> 50:30.572
They use iPhones. They use
Windows.

50:30.612 --> 50:33.157
They use Google Android...

50:33.199 --> 50:36.452
Is it okay... you know, maybe
it's not okay that the CIA...

50:36.536 --> 50:39.039
and other people can spy on you
in your private moments.

50:39.079 --> 50:40.539
But what about the
people that...

50:41.206 --> 50:43.249
Hey!

50:43.251 --> 50:44.544
Shaw!

51:46.021 --> 51:48.482
I guess I'm the stupid one,
right?

52:01.954 --> 52:02.996
So, uh...

52:06.876 --> 52:20.470
You ever gonna answer
my question?

52:20.472 --> 52:21.807
My money?

52:23.351 --> 52:25.061
What did you do with it?

52:38.407 --> 52:39.867
Sorry, John.

52:43.329 --> 52:44.581
That's no answer.

52:47.333 --> 52:48.876
Five thousand dollars.

53:02.766 --> 53:04.517
I didn't know what to do.

53:05.351 --> 53:16.360
She was gonna lose the house,
John.

53:16.362 --> 53:18.114
Thought you were my friend.

54:00.657 --> 54:01.990
Is Robbie home?

54:12.251 --> 54:13.795
Dear God...

54:13.836 --> 54:16.505
Bless this, the food of
thy servants.

54:16.588 --> 54:19.174
For holy art thou, now
and forever...

54:19.259 --> 54:21.177
unto the ages of ages.

54:22.137 --> 54:23.388
Holy spirit,

54:23.429 --> 54:25.681
as this food feeds our bodies,

54:25.764 --> 54:29.516
so we pray you would nourish
our souls. Amen.

54:29.518 --> 54:30.769
Amen.

54:33.481 --> 54:35.108
How are you, son?

54:36.443 --> 54:37.652
Fine.

54:39.528 --> 54:40.822
You like it?

54:40.864 --> 54:41.822
Yeah.

54:41.864 --> 54:43.282
It's good.

54:43.324 --> 54:46.161
I heard what happened
to your mother.

54:49.121 --> 54:55.543
She... is with the angels now.

54:55.545 --> 54:57.005
I kill the chickens.

54:57.047 --> 54:59.173
He killed the chicken
in the soup.

55:01.300 --> 55:02.302
We raise 'em.

55:02.344 --> 55:03.802
On the farm.

55:04.887 --> 55:10.391
- Oh, I have your homework.
- After dinner.

55:10.393 --> 55:13.021
She's smiling down on you.

55:17.317 --> 55:18.275
You know,

55:18.318 --> 55:19.819
she's smiling down.

55:22.405 --> 55:24.237
I...

55:24.239 --> 55:27.867
I... I don't know.

55:27.869 --> 55:30.079
Do I make you feel
uncomfortable?

55:30.996 --> 55:31.998
No, sir.

55:38.588 --> 55:40.006
Wanna play?

55:43.510 --> 55:45.011
Come on, you gotta block it.

55:45.552 --> 55:47.012
Yeah, there you go.

55:51.351 --> 56:02.275
Come on.

56:02.277 --> 56:06.613
Blocked it.

56:06.615 --> 56:08.034
Whoa.

56:30.724 --> 56:32.392
Well, looks like you beat me...

56:33.643 --> 56:35.061
uh, well...

56:35.561 --> 56:38.815
I lost count but I'm pretty sure I had
one, and you had, like...

56:39.565 --> 56:41.108
ten...

56:41.150 --> 56:42.609
twenty, 100, you know.

56:42.652 --> 56:44.070
Yeah.

57:34.536 --> 57:35.788
Fuck.

57:40.543 --> 57:41.795
Dad.

57:43.545 --> 57:49.508
Dad?

57:49.510 --> 57:51.469
Dad!

57:51.471 --> 57:53.056
What... what?

57:54.014 --> 57:55.016
Dad!

57:55.516 --> 57:56.518
Dad?

57:57.643 --> 57:58.894
Dad?

58:03.565 --> 58:05.483
Please...

58:05.485 --> 58:30.173
Dad...

58:30.175 --> 58:31.177
Shaw...

58:37.684 --> 58:39.851
You think I'm a shitty father.

58:39.853 --> 58:41.061
Don't you?

58:50.739 --> 58:51.740
I had, uh...

58:51.780 --> 58:53.907
I had a word with the
funeral home.

59:00.081 --> 59:05.626
Why'd you do that?

59:05.628 --> 59:07.297
Well, I sold all that, uh...

59:08.213 --> 59:09.965
Army surplus stuff, we
had in the shed.

59:10.884 --> 59:13.550
I didn't get a lot for it,
but...

59:13.552 --> 59:15.179
it should be enough...

59:15.221 --> 59:17.389
...to cover a small ceremony.
It's just...

59:17.724 --> 59:19.100
me and you.

59:22.811 --> 59:24.230
How soon?

59:24.646 --> 59:26.732
I was thinking the day
after tomorrow?

59:26.775 --> 59:29.068
I'll... call 'em in the morning.

59:29.818 --> 59:30.945
You have church clothes?

59:30.987 --> 59:32.905
Yeah. Somewhere.

59:44.668 --> 59:45.794
Dad.

59:45.835 --> 59:47.253
Mm?

59:49.755 --> 59:51.340
Cliff keeps messing with me.

59:54.260 --> 59:56.805
Look, just don't go to the Penn
Mart for a couple of days.

59:56.846 --> 59:58.389
I'll talk to Dan.

59:58.431 --> 1:00:45.684
I'll get it straightened out,
don't worry about it.

1:00:45.686 --> 1:00:47.480
Good morning, Mr. Templeton.

1:00:47.981 --> 1:00:49.232
Mornin'.

1:00:51.400 --> 1:02:57.858
Please, come in.

1:02:57.860 --> 1:02:58.819
Shaw!

1:02:58.862 --> 1:03:00.113
Shit.

1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:10.954
I gotta talk to you.

1:03:10.956 --> 1:03:12.625
I gotta tell you something.

1:03:19.965 --> 1:03:21.507
Shaw.

1:03:21.509 --> 1:03:22.510
Yeah?

1:03:22.844 --> 1:03:24.137
Yeah.

1:03:27.849 --> 1:03:29.351
What are ya doin'?

1:03:29.893 --> 1:03:31.519
You asleep?

1:03:31.978 --> 1:03:36.481
Yes.

1:03:36.483 --> 1:03:37.484
Okay...

1:03:40.362 --> 1:04:08.179
Talk in the morning?

1:04:08.181 --> 1:04:09.391
Hello?

1:04:10.016 --> 1:04:11.184
Hello?

1:04:11.684 --> 1:04:12.726
Hey, Will.

1:04:15.938 --> 1:04:17.523
Hey, John. What's up?

1:04:18.233 --> 1:04:21.066
I was just thinking, uh...

1:04:21.068 --> 1:04:22.528
I don't know what happened.

1:04:23.195 --> 1:04:25.197
I overreacted, I guess.

1:04:28.201 --> 1:04:33.246
I don't know what to say.

1:04:33.248 --> 1:04:34.749
I fucked up.

1:04:36.376 --> 1:04:38.711
I don't blame ya for
bein' pissed.

1:04:44.217 --> 1:04:45.552
John?

1:04:49.222 --> 1:04:55.934
Don't worry about it.

1:04:55.936 --> 1:04:58.230
I was, uh, thinkin'
about heading out,

1:04:58.273 --> 1:05:00.316
you know it's real nice out,
not too cold.

1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:03.445
No... no. I gotta be
with Shaw today.

1:05:04.903 --> 1:05:07.614
If we go now we'll be back
before breakfast.

1:05:11.494 --> 1:05:12.495
Come on.

1:05:17.250 --> 1:05:18.751
You up for it?

1:05:58.833 --> 1:05:59.834
Dad!

1:06:04.713 --> 1:06:05.715
Dad?

1:06:21.856 --> 1:06:22.899
Dad!

1:07:06.025 --> 1:07:08.025
I gotta go.

1:07:08.027 --> 1:07:09.695
Head back the same way?

1:07:11.864 --> 1:07:12.865
Up there.

1:08:57.470 --> 1:09:01.388
Are you the grandson?

1:09:01.390 --> 1:09:02.808
That's not my mom.

1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:08.687
That's Mrs. Oliver.

1:09:08.689 --> 1:09:10.482
That's... that's not my mom.

1:09:11.568 --> 1:09:14.317
Her funeral's today.

1:09:14.319 --> 1:09:15.279
Where is she?

1:09:15.320 --> 1:09:17.157
Is everything all right, Mr.
Davis?

1:09:18.323 --> 1:09:20.284
Everything is fine, thank you.

1:09:20.326 --> 1:09:22.203
You'd better go out to the car,
they'll be expecting you.

1:09:22.244 --> 1:09:23.496
Yes, sir.

1:09:26.666 --> 1:09:29.043
I'm Alan Davis, the
funeral director.

1:09:30.086 --> 1:09:32.336
What's your name?

1:09:32.338 --> 1:09:33.547
Shaw Templeton.

1:09:36.926 --> 1:09:39.429
Well, Mr.Templeton, if you would
join me in my office,

1:09:39.511 --> 1:09:41.514
I think we can
straighten this out.

1:09:46.394 --> 1:09:50.190
Now, Mr. Templeton. You're
William's son, is that correct?

1:09:50.230 --> 1:09:51.523
Yes.

1:09:52.692 --> 1:09:54.527
Did your father come with you?

1:09:56.863 --> 1:09:58.698
I don't know where he is.

1:10:01.283 --> 1:10:03.744
He told you there was a
funeral today?

1:10:14.255 --> 1:10:18.134
Mr. Templeton came in yesterday
wanting to arrange a funeral.

1:10:20.302 --> 1:10:22.055
I quoted him our prices.

1:10:23.390 --> 1:10:27.058
He did not have enough money.

1:10:27.060 --> 1:10:29.729
He decided to cremate Mrs.
Templeton's remains.

1:10:30.396 --> 1:10:36.401
I have them in the next room.

1:10:36.403 --> 1:10:37.570
Can I see?

1:10:39.905 --> 1:10:41.073
Of course.

1:11:08.768 --> 1:11:11.688
No, I'm afraid Mr. Templeton
is the only person

1:11:11.770 --> 1:11:14.106
who can claim Mrs.
Templeton's remains.

1:11:17.444 --> 1:11:19.112
I'm sorry for your loss.

1:11:50.476 --> 1:11:51.978
Give...

1:11:55.564 --> 1:11:57.817
Give me the fucking urn.

1:11:59.319 --> 1:12:00.320
Okay...

1:12:06.408 --> 1:12:07.868
It's my mom.

1:12:11.038 --> 1:12:12.247
Fuck you.

1:12:23.259 --> 1:12:24.260
Kevin!

1:12:24.344 --> 1:12:26.011
- Stop him!
- Fuck...

1:12:26.554 --> 1:12:27.846
Hey!

1:12:29.515 --> 1:12:31.433
Stop! Fuck...

1:12:31.518 --> 1:14:14.869
Shit...

1:14:14.871 --> 1:14:16.663
Hey, sorry.

1:14:16.706 --> 1:14:18.208
I meant to...

1:17:09.337 --> 1:17:10.338
What?

1:17:25.520 --> 1:17:27.856
...bring the horse blankets,
bundle up...

1:17:27.896 --> 1:17:31.065
You'll be glad you did...

1:17:31.067 --> 1:17:33.485
...brief shot of winter
coming our way.

1:17:33.528 --> 1:17:35.864
Here's that cold front now
making eastward progress.

1:17:35.904 --> 1:17:38.657
A couple rain showers up ahead
and just behind it.

1:17:38.699 --> 1:17:43.704
Could see some snow showers
across Western Pennsylvania...

1:17:48.167 --> 1:17:49.752
It's okay?
