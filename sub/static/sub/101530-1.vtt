04:21.988 --> 04:23.856
<i>Every journey has its road.</i>

04:27.226 --> 04:30.630
<i>And every road, sooner or later,
comes to a crossing,</i>

04:32.164 --> 04:35.735
<i>certain junction
and only one choice to make.</i>

04:38.104 --> 04:40.472
<i>That crossing arrived for us,
too.</i>

04:43.643 --> 04:48.047
<i>But no one could have imagined that
it would change our fates forever.</i>

05:33.525 --> 05:37.495
<i>Lunar eclipses have
fascinated mankind throughout the ages.</i>

05:37.529 --> 05:41.566
<i>The relationship between man and
Moon has always been so strong</i>

05:41.599 --> 05:47.539
<i>that in certain ancient cultures these phenomena
were perceived as cause for great concern.</i>

05:47.572 --> 05:51.543
- Are you guys watching?
- I've already seen one on YouTube.

05:51.944 --> 05:53.079
I think I watched with my dad.

05:53.112 --> 05:56.215
I've got a pair of welder
glasses at home like you.

05:57.083 --> 05:58.583
I could lend them to you.

05:58.616 --> 05:59.852
No.

05:59.885 --> 06:03.723
Welded glasses are for solar
eclipses, not lunar eclipses.

06:03.756 --> 06:05.825
And they're not that great
anyway

06:05.858 --> 06:07.994
because of the double
refraction.

06:08.794 --> 06:09.962
The double what?

06:09.996 --> 06:11.964
- The double refraction.
- Yeah?

06:11.998 --> 06:15.101
Otherwise known
as the birefringence,

06:15.835 --> 06:19.638
an optical phenomenon
caused by the light and...

06:20.239 --> 06:21.640
Idiot.

06:57.943 --> 07:00.980
<i>Lunar eclipses were,
in fact, interpreted to be symbolic</i>

07:01.013 --> 07:05.751
<i>of the great afternoon sky
right over there.</i>

07:05.785 --> 07:06.719
Bleh!

07:06.752 --> 07:08.687
<i>Stories and legends aside,</i>

07:08.721 --> 07:10.823
<i>this eclipse will be one
of the longest</i>

07:10.856 --> 07:14.260
<i>and the most fascinating total
lunar eclipses of the last century.</i>

07:14.293 --> 07:18.998
<i>So, tonight, we encourage you
all to lift your heads to the sky</i>

07:19.031 --> 07:21.700
<i>and take in this spectacular
and unique event.</i>

07:22.668 --> 07:23.736
<i>Don't miss out.</i>

07:23.769 --> 07:26.839
<i>Or you'll be waiting 20 years
for the next one.</i>

07:26.872 --> 07:29.275
Hey, Bess, will you watch it?

07:29.942 --> 07:31.811
Um, I'm not sure.

07:31.844 --> 07:34.080
Maybe with a certain someone.

07:38.350 --> 07:40.019
<i>Stories and legends aside,</i>

07:40.052 --> 07:42.620
<i>this eclipse will be one
of the longest</i>

07:42.655 --> 07:45.891
<i>and most fascinating total lunar

<i>So, tonight, we encourage you
all to lift your heads to the sky</i>

07:50.396 --> 07:53.598

<i>Don't miss out.</i>

07:55.234 --> 07:58.304
<i>Or you'll be waiting 20 years
for the next one.</i>

07:58.337 --> 08:01.073
Hey, Joe,
could you go any slower?

08:01.107 --> 08:03.042
I'm sick
of being on this piece of junk.

08:03.075 --> 08:06.045
This piece of junk
is four times your age, Reg.

08:06.078 --> 08:09.682
Oh, well, even better,
an old piece of junk.

08:09.715 --> 08:12.218
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

08:13.018 --> 08:14.286
I've got a riddle.

08:14.320 --> 08:15.688
Brace yourselves.

08:15.721 --> 08:20.025
What follows us
all day long behind...

08:20.059 --> 08:24.163
- Our shadow.
- ...in the dark?

08:27.133 --> 08:33.139
Oh, intelligent
screwed you over again.

08:36.942 --> 08:40.346
Hey, I got a riddle
you won't find online.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.715
Let's hear it.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.317
Seven letters has my name.

08:46.051 --> 08:48.354
Being a tough guy is my game.

08:49.288 --> 08:55.928
Neither monsters, storms, nor dragons
can stop me even without my weaponry.

08:57.096 --> 08:59.331
Now, ponder my words carefully.

09:00.166 --> 09:04.236
Virtue and nobility
are nothing without fear.

09:05.137 --> 09:10.042
Even for the king of kings,
him with the golden mane,

09:10.476 --> 09:16.248
he who thanks to me can live,
roar, and reign.

09:17.816 --> 09:18.784
Who am I?

09:22.254 --> 09:24.723
Oh, you struggling, IQ.

10:17.076 --> 10:19.778
Do we...
do we have to turn back now?

10:23.415 --> 10:25.784
Not necessarily.

12:28.173 --> 12:29.541
Everybody stay here.

12:43.255 --> 12:45.190
Oh, gross.

12:45.224 --> 12:47.192
Poor thing.
It must have been run over.

12:47.226 --> 12:48.127
What the fuck is it?

12:48.661 --> 12:49.895
Oh.

12:51.397 --> 12:52.364
Should we help him?

12:52.398 --> 12:53.265
Nah.

12:53.700 --> 12:56.201
I bet it stinks.

12:56.669 --> 12:58.370
Yeah, like you after
P.E.

13:02.508 --> 13:04.276
You are such a pig.

13:04.309 --> 13:06.278
Oink, oink.

13:32.371 --> 13:34.306
You know, I rode a pig once.

13:34.339 --> 13:37.342
Just pigs riding pigs, yeah?

13:38.177 --> 13:41.413
Anyway,
I'm on this pig, massive.

13:41.447 --> 13:44.149
So, I was grabbing it by his
ears and we started riding

13:44.183 --> 13:46.084
and all I hear the whole time...

13:48.053 --> 13:50.522
So, I'm riding it and there's a
herd of them behind me also...

13:51.658 --> 13:53.192
- ...and then Chris...
- A... a whole herd of them?

13:53.225 --> 13:54.694
A whole herd of them.
And Chris' chick...

13:54.727 --> 13:59.298
Well, well, well, good evening.

14:02.769 --> 14:04.136
Sit down.

14:05.304 --> 14:08.407
Just stay calm, guys, okay?
He's not going to hurt us.

14:09.074 --> 14:10.375
Wrong answer.

14:11.043 --> 14:15.347
From now on,
you just sit down and you drive.

14:16.615 --> 14:18.718
I should be doing the talking
from now on.

14:19.384 --> 14:20.252
Got that kids?

14:23.455 --> 14:25.257
I can't hear you. You got it?

14:26.124 --> 14:27.326
- Got it.
- Got it.

14:27.694 --> 14:28.560
Good.

14:34.533 --> 14:35.635
Obedient, too.

14:39.104 --> 14:42.274
You, there.

14:44.142 --> 14:45.244
You...

14:47.346 --> 14:48.480
drive.

14:56.321 --> 14:57.322
It's him.

15:04.664 --> 15:05.765
That was him.

15:05.798 --> 15:11.270
Mark, he was trying to kiss her
and she was screaming.

15:11.303 --> 15:17.209
So, I go,
"Hey, leave her alone."

15:18.343 --> 15:20.546
And then he turns around
with a stupid little face

15:20.579 --> 15:24.784
and goes, "Karl,
the canteen's over that way."

15:25.685 --> 15:27.553
And he was with his friends,
there was like seven of them.

15:27.586 --> 15:29.521
Yeah,
but I bet that didn't scare you.

15:30.188 --> 15:31.256
Of course, it didn't.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.661
I slide tag with him and
kick them straight in the balls,

15:34.694 --> 15:37.496
then I got up and hit the other
one with a backhand strike.

15:38.230 --> 15:42.601
Yeah. The third managed to block
me, but I kicked down the fourth

15:42.635 --> 15:44.202
and pushed the third
on to the sixth.

15:44.236 --> 15:50.142
And the last one, well,
attacked him with a super boost

15:50.576 --> 15:56.181
just like a real wrestler,
letting chaos everywhere, KO,

15:56.548 --> 15:57.583
and the final kiss.

15:58.283 --> 16:01.286
- A super boost?
- Mm-hmm. Just like that.

16:03.422 --> 16:04.423
Sorry.

16:12.364 --> 16:15.100
- Is that him?
- Yes.

16:16.636 --> 16:19.404
We've been looking for this guy
everywhere.

16:20.305 --> 16:26.746
We really have to find him before he
claims other victims and eats more tongues.

16:28.180 --> 16:29.414
And I don't know what it is,

16:29.882 --> 16:32.685
but he just seems
to love teenagers.

16:34.486 --> 16:36.388
We've got that super boost,
right?

16:53.773 --> 16:57.744
Now, if you could all
listen carefully,

16:58.678 --> 17:01.246
throw your fucking phones
out the windows.

17:07.285 --> 17:08.453
You, too.

17:08.988 --> 17:12.591
- Fuck you.
- Reg, do what he says.

17:12.624 --> 17:13.492
Sit.

17:17.262 --> 17:18.798
He's right, you know.

17:20.265 --> 17:22.401
No time for playing games.

17:22.434 --> 17:23.736
This gun is real.

17:24.469 --> 17:27.339
And I know what death
tastes like.

17:27.372 --> 17:31.243
It tastes delicious.

17:33.345 --> 17:35.682
It's Pedro Minghella.

17:36.615 --> 17:38.685
The tongue eater.

17:38.718 --> 17:39.584
Who?

17:40.252 --> 17:41.821
The tongue eater.

17:42.487 --> 17:44.456
It's really,
I'm just fucked up, eh.

17:44.489 --> 17:47.526
Prison can be a very informative
experience.

17:47.559 --> 17:49.996
You should try it sometimes.

17:52.597 --> 17:53.565
Fuck.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.234
Good boy.

18:00.640 --> 18:04.476
Fucking things
turned you all into zombies.

18:08.513 --> 18:13.753
Now, let's sit back
and enjoy the journey, shall we?

18:14.654 --> 18:18.390
The night is long
and the seas are rough.

19:11.409 --> 19:12.678
What's your name boy?

19:13.980 --> 19:16.414
- Uh, Nolan. Nolan.
- Nolan?

19:17.349 --> 19:18.383
Nolan Parker.

19:20.953 --> 19:22.454
Nolan Parker.

19:23.122 --> 19:25.357
Sounds like something
out of a comic book.

19:26.793 --> 19:28.961
I used to love comic books
when I was a kid.

19:30.029 --> 19:34.667
First thing I ever stole,
pack of smokes, comic book.

19:35.902 --> 19:37.302
I was obsessed.

20:34.660 --> 20:35.661
Shit.

20:38.430 --> 20:39.364
What's going on?

20:40.633 --> 20:41.968
You better not
be fucking with me.

20:42.001 --> 20:43.870
I don't know, it just stopped.

20:43.903 --> 20:45.738
Well, get it fixed.

20:46.138 --> 20:47.974
You don't want me to lose
my patience, do you?

20:52.812 --> 20:54.914
It won't start.
It... it must be the motor.

20:56.082 --> 20:59.185
- Get here.
- No, no, please, please, don't hurt me.

20:59.218 --> 21:00.518
Now, you get it fixed.

21:00.552 --> 21:03.555
One mistake,
and her head goes boom.

21:03.588 --> 21:08.794
- Okay, okay, just calm down.
- Calm down?

21:08.828 --> 21:10.830
I'm always calm.

21:10.863 --> 21:11.764
Get out.

21:12.832 --> 21:13.766
Okay.

21:22.074 --> 21:23.843
And that goes for you lot, too.

21:45.831 --> 21:46.699
He's going to kill us.

21:47.565 --> 21:48.634
He's going to kill us all.

21:49.201 --> 21:50.568
He's an absolute psycho.

21:51.203 --> 21:52.939
We need to disarm him.

21:52.972 --> 21:55.174
Yeah, I agree. But how?

21:55.207 --> 21:58.144
No, no, no, don't...
don't try and be a hero now.

21:58.811 --> 22:00.913
He'll shoot you in the head
without thinking twice.

22:00.947 --> 22:05.651
Yeah, Fat is right. For now,
we just need to do nothing, all right?

22:05.685 --> 22:07.086
Wait for the right moment.

22:08.254 --> 22:10.022
God.

22:13.759 --> 22:14.627
Well?

22:15.828 --> 22:21.968
I don't know,
it must be the engine.

23:08.714 --> 23:09.982
Get that thing out of here.

23:10.615 --> 23:11.784
I'll stay here with them.

25:03.929 --> 25:04.997
Oh, no, fuck!

25:05.030 --> 25:07.366
- Shut up! Shut up and sit down.
- No, we need to go.

25:07.399 --> 25:09.068
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

25:09.101 --> 25:10.436
- Sit down!
- Oh, my God!

25:10.469 --> 25:13.172
Shut up and shut up and shut up!
Let me fucking think.

25:13.205 --> 25:15.174
Oh, my God, you fucking psycho.

25:15.207 --> 25:17.009
Look at his mess.
Just let us off.

25:17.042 --> 25:17.977
That's enough.

25:18.010 --> 25:20.146
I don't want to hear
another one out of you.

25:20.179 --> 25:21.647
Do you understand?

25:26.018 --> 25:27.052
Fuck.

25:27.419 --> 25:29.255
Where the fuck are the keys?

25:29.889 --> 25:31.457
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

25:31.490 --> 25:33.125
Fuck! Fuck!

25:33.726 --> 25:36.128
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

25:36.162 --> 25:37.062
Fuck!

25:46.739 --> 25:47.439
It's showtime.

25:48.507 --> 25:49.942
Go get the keys
off that bastard.

25:51.043 --> 25:53.647
- Now!
- Leave him alone, I'll go.

25:54.880 --> 25:55.915
Okay, move it.

25:56.382 --> 25:57.783
Bess, no!

26:02.922 --> 26:07.126
She makes one wrong move
and I'll blow your brains out.

27:47.393 --> 27:48.994
Get it started.

27:50.262 --> 27:51.964
I'm not starting shit.

27:51.997 --> 27:53.866
I don't even know
how to fucking drive.

27:55.167 --> 27:56.335
So, you're okay?

27:58.404 --> 28:00.172
And Joseph?

28:11.383 --> 28:12.885
Just do it.

28:15.888 --> 28:18.324
It was awful.

28:18.891 --> 28:25.297
It was like he'd been bitten by
maybe an animal, like, I don't know.

28:26.098 --> 28:27.032
I don't know.

28:32.304 --> 28:33.172
Fuck.

28:34.139 --> 28:35.374
So?

28:37.677 --> 28:39.378
Make this thing move.

28:40.145 --> 28:42.514
Are you blind? I'm trying.

28:42.548 --> 28:46.018
And I'm trying to resist the
urge to shoot you in the face.

28:46.051 --> 28:48.587
Oh, God.

28:48.620 --> 28:50.155
We need to do something.

28:55.227 --> 29:01.567
Well, if you do not get this pile of
junk moving in the next 10 seconds,

29:01.600 --> 29:04.570
I'm going to shoot every one
of your friends one at a time

29:04.603 --> 29:06.639
starting with four-eyes.

29:08.574 --> 29:10.175
Her name's IQ.

29:10.542 --> 29:14.413
This piece of junk
belonged to my friend Joe.

29:14.446 --> 29:16.315
No, no, no!

29:20.018 --> 29:21.920
So, who's really fucking
crazy now, eh?

29:22.554 --> 29:24.957
You haven't got the balls.

29:28.327 --> 29:29.461
I know that smell.

29:30.963 --> 29:34.933
It's the smell of a gutless little
wonder trying to play the big man.

29:36.335 --> 29:41.407
If I were you, I'd shoot now before
your friends all smell it too.

29:41.440 --> 29:42.608
I don't have any friends.

29:45.010 --> 29:46.545
It's here.

29:49.381 --> 29:53.252
I didn't escape from prison to
die in a battle box like this.

30:10.436 --> 30:13.038
Come on, show your face.

30:24.717 --> 30:27.654
<i>♪ La, la, la, la ♪</i>

31:01.520 --> 31:02.421
Shh. Shh.

31:07.593 --> 31:09.161
Oh, shit.

31:09.194 --> 31:12.030
- Shit. Shit. Shit.
- We are... we are doomed.

31:12.064 --> 31:14.132
- Come, Bess, come.
- Fuck this! Fuck this! Fuck this!

31:14.166 --> 31:15.501
This is not happening.
This is not happening.

31:15.534 --> 31:19.639
- Calm... down.
- No, he fired. He could be dead as well.

31:19.672 --> 31:22.441
Yeah, we're all gonna be dead
next, you know. Shut the fuck up.

31:22.474 --> 31:25.143
- Calm down!
- We're trapped in a tunnel

31:25.611 --> 31:29.348
- and we're all going to die one by one.
- Fuck.

31:29.381 --> 31:31.684
No, no, no, come on, there must be
a logical explanation for all this.

31:31.718 --> 31:35.220
The only logical thing here is
certainly this little whiny bitch.

31:35.254 --> 31:36.355
Reggie, stop,
this isn't helping.

31:36.388 --> 31:39.091
Oh, all right, what the fuck
are you going to do, huh?

31:39.124 --> 31:40.592
You're gonna fucking hit me
or something?

31:40.626 --> 31:42.160
Let's just calm down, Reggie.

31:42.194 --> 31:45.364
Just stop it. You're not making
things any easier.

32:23.703 --> 32:28.607
Fuck.

32:28.641 --> 32:33.545
Okay, oh, you got me.
I'm... I'm scared shitless.

32:34.413 --> 32:37.215
They... they... they...
they... they... they weren't...

32:37.249 --> 32:38.617
Those weren't hands.

32:39.318 --> 32:40.653
They weren't human.

32:41.320 --> 32:42.521
They definitely weren't.

32:42.554 --> 32:44.489
We need to get out of here now.

32:45.157 --> 32:47.660
Oh, please Lord, please.

32:47.694 --> 32:50.262
Okay, Reggie, you drive.
Now, you're just making too much noise.

32:50.295 --> 32:55.233
Boys, that's it, we need to create
a fucking pandemonium, idiot.

32:56.836 --> 32:59.204
Fucking damn it!

33:01.908 --> 33:04.242
A push won't fucking work.

33:04.276 --> 33:07.914
- Nothing is fucking working.
- We just need to deal with this ourselves, okay?

33:07.947 --> 33:10.917
Yeah, if we all work as a team,
we'll probably make it out of here alive.

33:10.950 --> 33:12.652
Fuck this.

33:12.685 --> 33:15.587
Fuck this. I don't need this.

33:16.421 --> 33:20.392
I just want to get off
this fucking bus and go home.

33:20.425 --> 33:22.561
That is what we all want,
Reggie.

35:13.572 --> 35:15.373
Reggie, come on. Reggie.

35:15.407 --> 35:16.608
You hear me? Reggie.

35:16.642 --> 35:17.977
You okay?

35:25.051 --> 35:26.819
I won't make a sound.

36:46.498 --> 36:47.733
Let go of me!

37:23.703 --> 37:25.470
Oh, God!

37:25.503 --> 37:26.839
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

37:50.562 --> 37:54.166
Come on, come on, hurry up.
Hurry up.

37:55.868 --> 37:58.838
Come on, let's go.
Go, go, go!

37:59.639 --> 38:01.841
- Hurry up, quickly!
- Come on, come, come on.

38:23.561 --> 38:25.463
Hey, where are you going, Karl?

38:25.497 --> 38:26.699
What, would you rather
turn back?

38:26.732 --> 38:27.800
Absolutely not.

38:27.833 --> 38:29.802
Okay, look, we just need
to keep going, okay.

38:29.835 --> 38:30.870
Yeah.
We'll find somewhere safe.

38:30.903 --> 38:32.772
We've got a better chance
of getting out of here.

38:32.805 --> 38:33.739
Yeah.

38:44.516 --> 38:48.553
- Yup, this place is fucking terrifying.
- Okay, just calm down.

38:48.586 --> 38:49.889
It's my worst nightmare.

38:53.225 --> 38:54.559
Fuck that.

38:56.996 --> 38:58.130
Fuck that.

39:01.267 --> 39:02.567
This way it is.

39:09.607 --> 39:11.043
What is this place?

39:11.811 --> 39:13.611
No idea, Queenie.

39:14.280 --> 39:15.715
Some kind of abyss?

39:16.182 --> 39:18.250
Yeah. Where are we?

39:19.617 --> 39:22.088
This is fucking hell.

39:22.121 --> 39:23.255
Let's get out of this.

39:23.289 --> 39:27.793
Guys, can we stop?
I can't take it any longer.

39:27.827 --> 39:29.594
I'm exhausted too.

39:34.700 --> 39:35.768
Hold on.

39:44.944 --> 39:46.846
Yeah, okay, we can stay in here.

39:47.847 --> 39:49.648
Karl, shut the door behind you.
Reggie.

39:49.682 --> 39:51.851
- Uh-huh?
- Can we get these candles lit up?

39:52.351 --> 39:53.686
All right, boss.

40:00.226 --> 40:01.794
- Fuck you, dude.
- Sorry.

40:20.980 --> 40:22.815
So that's the floor plan
of this place.

40:23.382 --> 40:26.052
Yeah,
looks like an old military fort.

40:26.085 --> 40:28.287
We need to find the control room
and switch on the generator.

40:28.320 --> 40:30.622
I'll take every single one
of you out to dinner

40:30.656 --> 40:33.159
if you can find one thing
that works in this pit.

40:33.192 --> 40:36.796
Well, you better book us a table
because Queenie's never wrong.

40:36.829 --> 40:39.165
Well,
I would if I had my phone then.

40:41.167 --> 40:44.303
Josie would have gotten us
out of here for sure.

40:46.906 --> 40:48.941
- Poor Joe.
- Yeah.

40:50.376 --> 40:53.611
Um, you know he knew my dad?

40:55.881 --> 40:57.016
Yeah.

40:59.251 --> 41:00.719
They played
in the Stormy Clouds together.

41:04.857 --> 41:06.225
Your dad played basketball?

41:06.258 --> 41:07.860
Yeah, small forward.

41:09.829 --> 41:11.230
It's the same hat as Joe's.

41:13.165 --> 41:14.934
Never seen your dad before.

41:16.035 --> 41:17.636
When did you last see him?

41:19.805 --> 41:21.107
Two years ago.

41:23.742 --> 41:24.844
It must be tough.

41:26.445 --> 41:27.913
They set him up.

41:29.448 --> 41:33.352
They were a patsy. He did nothing
but he's the one doing time.

41:38.390 --> 41:41.060
- Well, that was your dad's?
- Yeah.

41:41.994 --> 41:43.095
It's cool.

41:44.363 --> 41:47.900
- So, where are we?
- Yeah.

41:48.901 --> 41:52.138
We should be right here.

41:53.038 --> 41:54.940
This place is huge.

41:54.974 --> 41:58.144
According to the floor plan,
the control room is right there.

41:58.177 --> 41:59.678
And I think
we should go check it out.

41:59.712 --> 42:01.413
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll go.

42:02.448 --> 42:03.782
You're up.

42:04.817 --> 42:06.018
I'm going to stay here.

42:06.051 --> 42:07.920
I think I might stay here, too.

42:07.953 --> 42:11.991
Okay, look, Reggie, you stay here
with them and I'll go with Nolan.

42:14.059 --> 42:14.927
Good luck.

42:15.794 --> 42:17.796
Don't you two
have too much fun, yeah?

42:54.300 --> 42:56.902
All right, so the control room
shouldn't be too far now.

42:58.070 --> 43:00.372
- What?
- Nothing.

43:01.040 --> 43:02.942
It was just a mouse.

43:02.975 --> 43:04.009
You're saying?

43:05.144 --> 43:08.414
I was saying that the
control room should be close.

43:08.447 --> 43:09.481
Okay.

43:30.236 --> 43:32.304
I said the control room
should be near.

43:33.572 --> 43:36.775
So straight ahead, then right.

43:37.543 --> 43:38.911
Isn't it left?

43:43.115 --> 43:46.885
Yeah, sorry, I've got
terrible sense of direction.

43:47.519 --> 43:49.388
Well, at least,
you're really good at drawing.

43:49.421 --> 43:50.923
- You think?
- Yeah.

43:52.157 --> 43:54.827
I saw your sketches on the bus,
I thought they were amazing.

43:54.860 --> 43:55.861
Thanks.

43:57.963 --> 43:59.531
You know, my mom painted.

43:59.565 --> 44:02.901
Really? Cool.
Like what sort of things?

44:02.935 --> 44:05.004
Just all sorts of landscapes.

44:05.838 --> 44:10.376
My favorite one is above my bed, it's this
amazing beach with like the bluest sea

44:10.409 --> 44:12.311
and its really white sand.

44:13.445 --> 44:14.246
So, it's beautiful.

44:15.981 --> 44:19.551
Five, six, five, six,
seven, eight...

44:28.894 --> 44:30.596
I'm so fucking hungry.

44:30.630 --> 44:32.298
Me, too.

44:35.601 --> 44:38.871
You know,
I'd kill for a hamburger right now.

44:38.904 --> 44:39.838
I bet you would.

44:41.540 --> 44:45.044
With some fried eggs,
jalapenos...

44:47.246 --> 44:53.452
...double bacon,
fries and a large drink.

44:54.754 --> 44:58.190
Look, man, we get that you're obese.
Just shut up, yeah?

45:04.063 --> 45:05.931
And that counts
for the noises, too.

45:08.100 --> 45:10.402
You're busting my fucking balls,
bro. Shut up.

45:11.170 --> 45:13.138
- Guys.
- Warming up.

45:14.907 --> 45:16.875
You're busting my fucking balls.

45:16.909 --> 45:19.044
- Guys.
- Shut up.

45:19.078 --> 45:20.312
So, you do have them?

45:21.213 --> 45:22.514
- Fuck you.
- Guys.

45:22.548 --> 45:24.116
- It was a joke.
- Why do I fuck?

45:24.149 --> 45:25.050
Fuck you.

45:25.951 --> 45:26.618
Guys.

45:28.454 --> 45:30.222
- Guys!
- What?

45:30.255 --> 45:33.892
I really need to pee.

45:36.261 --> 45:40.466
So, uh, who's coming with me?

46:14.233 --> 46:15.167
What is this?

46:31.550 --> 46:32.685
There's lights.

46:33.919 --> 46:37.556
You remember on the bus,
that thing can't stand the light.

46:40.092 --> 46:41.694
Someone's already tried
to kill it.

46:42.461 --> 46:44.997
It doesn't look like
the plan worked out though.

46:49.736 --> 46:51.270
We need to find
the main switchboard.

46:58.444 --> 47:00.579
- Here is good.
- Sure.

47:08.253 --> 47:09.588
Turn around.

47:09.621 --> 47:11.658
Come on, you're not the first girl
I've seen with the pants down.

47:13.058 --> 47:14.761
You are such an idiot.

47:14.794 --> 47:16.261
Turn around.

47:20.165 --> 47:22.702
I said turn around.

47:28.340 --> 47:30.643
Move away further.

47:34.714 --> 47:38.050
- Not too far though.
- All right, all right.

47:39.284 --> 47:42.588
Just hurry up and piss, yeah?
Let's get back to Karl.

47:49.528 --> 47:53.599
You know, you are kind of cute
when you're mad though.

47:54.500 --> 47:56.001
Should piss you off more.

47:57.770 --> 48:02.574
Queenie, are you done?

48:05.344 --> 48:06.245
Queenie.

48:08.848 --> 48:10.215
Shit.

48:10.249 --> 48:12.351
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

48:12.384 --> 48:13.585
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

48:33.706 --> 48:36.341
Karl, they've got her.

48:47.619 --> 48:49.354
It should be in here somewhere.

49:09.642 --> 49:11.109
Here it is.

49:11.143 --> 49:12.511
Queenie!

49:12.879 --> 49:15.748
- It's all my fucking fault.
- Check in her.

49:15.782 --> 49:16.883
- IQ!
- IQ!

49:16.916 --> 49:18.751
Queenie!

49:19.886 --> 49:23.388
- Oh, shit, shit. IQ!
- Queenie!

49:24.389 --> 49:25.591
Queenie!

49:25.624 --> 49:26.558
Queenie!

49:28.560 --> 49:30.395
Queenie? Oh!

49:30.429 --> 49:33.498
Queenie!

49:34.166 --> 49:35.400
Get the fuck off of her!

49:35.434 --> 49:37.502
Get the fuck off of her!

49:37.536 --> 49:39.171
Oh, my God! Run!

49:42.809 --> 49:44.677
Run! Run!

49:56.521 --> 49:58.290
It won't budge.

49:58.323 --> 49:59.324
Let me help you.

50:04.864 --> 50:08.367
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

50:10.970 --> 50:11.904
Reggie.

50:27.452 --> 50:28.320
Reggie.

50:32.859 --> 50:34.192
Reg!

50:45.872 --> 50:46.739
Reggie.

50:56.415 --> 50:57.315
Reg!

50:58.718 --> 51:01.954
No! No! No!

51:01.988 --> 51:03.690
No! No!

51:03.723 --> 51:06.693
No! No! No! No!

51:06.726 --> 51:07.927
No!

51:12.765 --> 51:13.733
Reg!

51:34.386 --> 51:35.688
They found the generator.

51:35.722 --> 51:37.255
We need to find them.

53:26.498 --> 53:29.434
"Your end, my beginning."

53:29.467 --> 53:31.570
"9th of February 2000."

53:45.017 --> 53:47.552
So, all we need to do now is
find the entrance to this place.

54:15.047 --> 54:17.884
Oh, my God.

54:21.888 --> 54:24.422
Reggie went with Queenie
who needed to wee.

54:24.456 --> 54:26.158
I stayed back but then Reggie
came back without Queenie

54:26.192 --> 54:27.760
- and said she'd been taken by a bunch of...
- Whoa, whoa, slow down,

54:27.793 --> 54:29.095
Karl, slow down. Calm down.

54:32.064 --> 54:33.598
I left her alone.

54:34.734 --> 54:35.668
It's my fault.

54:36.636 --> 54:38.570
I'll be all right.

54:46.679 --> 54:47.579
Shit.

54:48.915 --> 54:51.416
Look, guys,
we need to fucking go.

54:52.218 --> 54:53.119
We can't.

54:56.889 --> 54:58.124
We need to show you
something first.

55:01.961 --> 55:05.631
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me introduce you to Giulio Sarpi.

55:08.968 --> 55:11.971
So, we're not the only people
who've seen this thing.

55:14.106 --> 55:15.641
He was obsessed with it.

55:15.675 --> 55:17.777
He called it
the Nocturne Wanderer.

55:18.644 --> 55:21.647
It killed his sister
40 years ago in this very place.

55:21.681 --> 55:26.786
Listen, "Isabelle and I
loved going on adventures.

55:27.720 --> 55:31.489
We used to pretend we were
explorers discovering faraway lands.

55:33.025 --> 55:36.629
And this evening was the perfect
evening for an expedition.

55:37.997 --> 55:41.499
We knew the place by heart
and our parents trusted us..."

55:42.201 --> 55:45.137
<i>Isabelle and I loved
going on adventures.</i>

55:45.171 --> 55:48.207
<i>We used to pretend we were
explorers discovering faraway lands</i>

55:48.841 --> 55:51.644
<i>and this evening was the perfect

55:52.111 --> 55:55.748
<i>We knew that place by heart

55:55.781 --> 55:59.752
<i>After all, nobody believes
in the big, bad wolf</i>

55:59.785 --> 56:01.687
<i>until it crosses their path.</i>

56:02.054 --> 56:04.556
<i>It appeared
before our eyes out of nowhere.</i>

56:04.589 --> 56:06.258
<i>It drew you into his lair</i>

56:06.292 --> 56:09.594
<i>and my life has never been
the same again.</i>

57:09.855 --> 57:14.126
<i>And God said let there be light,
and there was light.</i>

57:14.693 --> 57:18.596
<i>God looking on the light,
saw that it was good</i>

57:18.631 --> 57:21.667
<i>and he made a division
between the light and the dark.</i>

57:22.134 --> 57:26.906
<i>And it was in the darkness that I
looked for you without ever finding you.</i>

57:27.306 --> 57:31.143
<i>You're the only nightmare
that has haunted me for years,</i>

57:31.177 --> 57:34.313
<i>as elusive and real
as the darkness.</i>

57:34.914 --> 57:37.883
<i>But I swear I will find you.</i>

57:44.790 --> 57:46.659
<i>I know how to trap you.</i>

57:46.692 --> 57:49.962
<i>And this time,
you won't run away.</i>

57:50.729 --> 57:53.132
<i>Your end, my beginning.</i>

59:32.798 --> 59:33.933
Shit.

59:35.067 --> 59:36.135
So, he went crazy.

59:36.168 --> 59:37.703
He was a desperate man.

59:37.736 --> 59:41.740
Yeah, he dedicated his entire life to
finding out the truth about his sister.

59:42.208 --> 59:45.177
I mean he researched everything
from theories,

59:45.211 --> 59:47.279
to scientific evidence,
to even pictures.

59:47.313 --> 59:48.814
Our theories are right.

59:49.315 --> 59:51.850
It hates the light
and lives in the darkness.

59:51.884 --> 59:58.023
Yeah, it feeds off of blood and
liquids like a vampire or a leech.

59:58.057 --> 1:00:01.894
No. Like a parasite.

1:00:03.095 --> 1:00:04.096
Like a parasite.

1:00:05.064 --> 1:00:06.232
And now it's fed on IQ.

1:00:06.265 --> 1:00:08.367
It won't stop
until it's finished.

1:01:42.127 --> 1:01:45.130
So, what's the plan?

1:01:45.597 --> 1:01:48.200
So, we have to stay.

1:01:50.135 --> 1:01:51.170
Stay and kill it.

1:01:52.171 --> 1:01:54.073
Finish the job
Giulio Sarpi started.

1:01:55.274 --> 1:01:57.910
I don't want anyone
to get hurt because of me.

1:01:57.943 --> 1:01:59.878
No one is getting left behind.

1:01:59.912 --> 1:02:01.847
We can only do this
if are all together.

1:02:02.514 --> 1:02:05.084
Just like a team of superheroes.

1:02:06.285 --> 1:02:09.288
What would you say, Reg?
I like being a superhero.

1:02:15.127 --> 1:02:18.530
If I see one spandex suit,
I'm fucking out.

1:02:21.533 --> 1:02:22.935
Let's kill this.

1:02:24.470 --> 1:02:25.337
His end.

1:02:26.138 --> 1:02:27.072
Our beginning.

1:02:57.069 --> 1:02:59.405
Ready.

1:03:38.076 --> 1:03:38.977
Karl.

1:03:40.012 --> 1:03:41.046
Karl.

1:03:41.547 --> 1:03:44.116
What?

1:03:44.149 --> 1:03:45.184
Stop hitting.

1:03:46.351 --> 1:03:47.286
Stop what?

1:03:47.319 --> 1:03:48.287
Your hands.

1:04:00.633 --> 1:04:04.036
Come on, fucking wanderer.

1:05:14.573 --> 1:05:16.074
Come on! Fuck.

1:06:38.891 --> 1:06:42.695
Hey, come in here! Come on!

1:06:53.271 --> 1:06:55.607
Reggie, come on. Come on.

1:07:15.527 --> 1:07:17.362
I'm scared.

1:07:17.396 --> 1:07:20.733
So am I, IQ,
but we'll make it out of here.

1:07:20.767 --> 1:07:25.203
Please don't... please don't leave me alone.

1:07:25.237 --> 1:07:26.806
I won't. I promise.

1:08:37.476 --> 1:08:39.712
Go, go. Go now!

1:08:40.545 --> 1:08:44.650
Come on, come on,
come on, we've got to go.

1:09:42.742 --> 1:09:45.845
- Run! Come on! Hurry up! Quickly!
- Come on! You can do it!

1:09:45.878 --> 1:09:46.979
Come on!

1:09:52.885 --> 1:09:55.922
Fight me now,
you fucking piece of shit.

1:11:10.830 --> 1:11:11.731
For Joe.

1:11:14.033 --> 1:11:15.001
For Joe.

1:11:23.943 --> 1:11:26.478
<i>Seven letters compose my name.</i>

1:11:26.511 --> 1:11:28.915
<i>Being a tough guy is my game.</i>

1:11:28.948 --> 1:11:33.451
<i>Neither monsters,
storms, no dragons can stop me.</i>

1:11:33.485 --> 1:11:36.088
<i>Even if you strip me
off my weaponry.</i>

1:11:37.123 --> 1:11:39.125
<i>Now, ponder my words carefully.</i>

1:11:39.959 --> 1:11:44.096
<i>Virtue and nobility
are nothing without fear.</i>

1:11:44.697 --> 1:11:46.799
<i>Even for the king of kings...</i>

1:11:46.832 --> 1:11:48.500
<i>...Him with the golden mane.</i>

1:11:48.533 --> 1:11:50.069
<i>He, who thanks to me...</i>

1:11:50.102 --> 1:11:51.237
<i>...can live...</i>

1:11:51.270 --> 1:11:52.772
- <i>...roar...</i>
- <i>...and reign.</i>

1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:55.440
<i>Courage.</i>

1:11:56.574 --> 1:11:58.244
<i>That was the answer
to the riddle</i>

1:11:58.277 --> 1:12:02.480
<i>and the only word to describe
what that ordeal taught us.</i>

1:12:03.581 --> 1:12:07.619
<i>What started as a simple shortcut
turned out to be much more.</i>

1:12:08.654 --> 1:12:11.623
<i>No one believed our story
or took us seriously.</i>

1:12:17.263 --> 1:12:18.731
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

1:12:19.966 --> 1:12:23.836
<i>What counts is us,
our friendship,</i>

1:12:24.203 --> 1:12:28.641
<i>and that incredible truth
that will stay with each of us</i>

1:12:28.674 --> 1:12:30.710
<i>for the rest of our lives.</i>
