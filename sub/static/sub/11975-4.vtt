00:09.100 --> 00:11.267
Welcome home, baby.
Rob is moving into his new

00:11.267 --> 00:14.100
house.
It's been a labor of love.

00:14.100 --> 00:16.100
Do you love it? Do you love it?
Do you love it?

00:16.100 --> 00:18.700
After Rob and Blac Chyna
started dating, Rob is out and

00:18.700 --> 00:21.033
- about.
- It's a miracle.

00:21.033 --> 00:24.167
If she gave him
confidence, more power to her.

00:24.167 --> 00:27.133
Even though there's been drama,
if this is what it takes, I

00:27.133 --> 00:37.367
don't care who he's dating.♪ ♪

00:37.367 --> 00:39.367
- Where's Khloe?
- I don't know.

00:39.367 --> 00:41.367
- I haven't seen her yet.
- Okay, cool.

00:41.367 --> 00:43.033
Harry's gonna be, like, a little
assistant.

00:43.033 --> 00:44.133
What does that mean?
Like, am I gonna be your

00:44.133 --> 00:45.367
- assistant...?
- Like a sous-chef.

00:45.367 --> 00:47.600
Sous-chef.
- Hello, hello, hello,

00:47.600 --> 00:49.733
- hello.
- Hello!

00:49.733 --> 00:51.733
- Hello.
- I'm so excited for

00:51.733 --> 00:53.733
- this.
- This is so up my

00:53.733 --> 00:56.867
- alley.
- Hey, Khlo.

00:56.867 --> 00:59.833
What are we doing today?
on

00:59.833 --> 01:02.733
- her app!
- Today we have sliders.

01:02.733 --> 01:05.000
But you know I don't
eat red meat or pork, and you

01:05.000 --> 01:07.100
picked that.
That's why I said chicken.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.133
- That's okay.
- So, Khloe doesn't eat

01:09.133 --> 01:11.133
red meat.
So, great. So...

01:11.133 --> 01:13.133
Or pork. So this is a
great meal.

01:13.133 --> 01:15.900
Or pork. So she's not
gonna be able to eat this meal.

01:15.900 --> 01:19.200
Just to be on a
segment on your app makes me so

01:19.200 --> 01:22.033
lubricated, you have no
idea.

01:22.033 --> 01:24.333
Okay, so what's always

01:24.333 --> 01:26.333
to know how to make
sliders.

01:26.333 --> 01:29.400
- Today we have beef.
- Ooh.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.400
Ground beef.
These are all our condiments.

01:31.400 --> 01:35.100
- Condoms!
- Um... we have our

01:35.100 --> 01:38.633
- little slider buns.
- Buns! Yeah!

01:38.633 --> 01:41.433
Bidi bidi bun bun!
But it never hurts to marinate

01:41.433 --> 01:43.700
- your meat.
- That's actually

01:43.700 --> 01:46.700
- disgusting, Khloe.
- And we have white

01:46.700 --> 01:48.500
- cheddar.
- Do you like white

01:48.500 --> 01:50.300
- cheddar the best?
- Yeah, I do.

01:50.300 --> 01:51.833
- Why's that?
- I don't know. I just

01:51.833 --> 01:53.633
like how it tastes.
Makes me feel good.

01:53.633 --> 01:55.100
- Yeah, no.
- I love things that

01:55.100 --> 01:57.100
- make me feel good.
- Like what?

01:57.100 --> 01:59.100
Normally they're not
white.

01:59.100 --> 02:02.900
- Hmm.
- Damn.

02:02.900 --> 02:05.000
Like you, Harry.

02:21.167 --> 02:25.100
- Sporty Spice!
- Sporty Spice is

02:25.100 --> 02:29.167
here.
Chic Spice. Furry Spice.

02:29.167 --> 02:31.600
- Yeah, Sporty Spice.
- Did you see my

02:31.600 --> 02:35.000
- bowling pic with the, um...
- Why are you sitting

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
right here?
Like, how am I supposed to talk

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
to you?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Oh, wait, she's telling us
something.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.400
- Okay.
- So, I called Rob, and he

02:44.400 --> 02:46.400
said that Chyna wants to talk to
me.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.067
And, you know, I just told him
that I'll talk to her when I'm

02:49.067 --> 02:52.000
ready.
And so he put me on speaker, and

02:52.000 --> 02:55.100
then he was like, "Oh, Kim,
Chyna's in the room.

02:55.100 --> 02:58.000
Um, I just wanted to tell you so
you didn't think I was alone."

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
And so she goes, "Hi," in the
background, and I didn't say

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
- anything, and then he...
- You didn't say hi?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
No, I did not know what
to say-- I froze.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
- You're joking.
- No, he goes, "Hold on.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
I'm gonna brush my teeth.
You talk to her."

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
And so I go, "Okay, gotta go.
Bye."

03:11.000 --> 03:14.167
And I hung up.
I understand that Kylie dating

03:14.167 --> 03:16.967
Tyga completely broke Chyna's
heart.

03:16.967 --> 03:20.033
I feel for her in that, you
know, situation.

03:20.033 --> 03:24.033
Was it uncomfortable for me when
Kylie and Tyga started to date?

03:24.033 --> 03:28.500
Absolutely. Because Chyna was my
friend, but I had no choice but

03:28.500 --> 03:31.767
to take my sister's side.
That's my sister.

03:31.767 --> 03:33.900
I just wasn't ready, you know?
And I'm not gonna, like, be

03:33.900 --> 03:35.900
forced to be on the phone with
her.

03:35.900 --> 03:38.167
Do I think that everyone needs
to sit down and talk and work it

03:38.167 --> 03:40.167
out?
Absolutely.

03:40.167 --> 03:42.900
I'll talk to her when I am
ready.

03:42.900 --> 03:45.567
I have no reason to
be rude.

03:45.567 --> 03:48.267
This is a g... I love
talking to you like this.

03:48.267 --> 03:51.333
Well, I can see
your text messages, too.

03:51.333 --> 03:54.600
Why do I care?
Oh, is that why you're sitting

03:54.600 --> 03:57.967
- here?
- Yeah.

04:04.333 --> 04:07.933
Come here, Goosie.
Okay, let's put on your jacket.

04:07.933 --> 04:11.333
Oh, my God, she's
wearing riding pants.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.333
- Hi, P.
- You want to go with

04:13.333 --> 04:15.333
Kenny and I'll get your
backpack?

04:15.333 --> 04:17.333
- Yeah.
- Okay.

04:17.333 --> 04:19.767
Come on.
I have been working nonstop and

04:19.767 --> 04:22.100
traveling a lot.
When I do come home, I try hard

04:22.100 --> 04:24.800
to see my sisters and my
brother.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.767
Mama, you see the
slices of bread.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.800
The last couple
times I've gone home, my nieces

04:29.800 --> 04:32.300
and nephews, every time I feel
like they get bigger and they

04:32.300 --> 04:34.367
grow up even more.
It's, like, crazy.

04:34.367 --> 04:36.367
The turkey Reuben
sounds good.

04:36.367 --> 04:38.367
- What comes on it?
- Turkey, Thousand

04:38.367 --> 04:40.800
Island, sauerkraut, and
mozzarella.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.633
- What's sauerkraut?
- You don't know what

04:43.633 --> 04:46.433
- sauerkraut is?
- No. It sounds gross.

04:46.433 --> 04:51.233
- It's like... sour.
- Kraut?

04:51.233 --> 04:53.233
- Exactly.
- I don't know what

04:53.233 --> 04:55.233
- kraut is.
- Yeah, I'm, like,

04:55.233 --> 04:58.200
- not on my "A" game today.
- Mm.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.200
Kylie looked so
pretty last night.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.233
Oh, what did you
guys do?

05:02.233 --> 05:04.733
Nicole Reda's in town.
They're staying with Allie and

05:04.733 --> 05:09.733
our friend Ben.
I took them to the WME party,

05:09.733 --> 05:11.967
- and it was fun.
- Again, I love that

05:11.967 --> 05:15.867
- you called me to hang out.
- I know.

05:15.867 --> 05:19.000
I'm joking.
You didn't call me.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.900
Oh.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.800
Mmm...

05:27.400 --> 05:29.733
I feel torn
sometimes, 'cause I do love my

05:29.733 --> 05:32.400
career and I love being able to
travel the world and I feel

05:32.400 --> 05:34.733
blessed, but at the same time, I
don't get to see my family very

05:34.733 --> 05:37.167
often and I feel like I'm
missing out on certain things

05:37.167 --> 05:39.933
at home, and it sucks.
You don't use the blue one very

05:39.933 --> 05:43.533
often, do you?

05:43.533 --> 05:47.100
I ran into your
friend Leon last night.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.667
- He was at Chateau.
- You know, it, like,

05:49.667 --> 05:52.033
still really annoys me that you
guys come to the city, and don't

05:52.033 --> 05:55.033
- hang out with me.
- You aren't always

05:55.033 --> 05:58.067
- here, so then we, like, forget.
- Forget about me?

05:58.067 --> 05:58.500
Yep.

06:08.933 --> 06:11.267
Oh, my God, we were
reading a bible book, and the

06:11.267 --> 06:15.567
angel in the book was this
person with long hair and, like,

06:15.567 --> 06:18.433
a white long dress, and Penelope
was like, "That looks like my

06:18.433 --> 06:21.900
grandma!"
And I was like, "Which grandma--

06:21.900 --> 06:24.433
Bonnie?"
She was like, "No."

06:24.433 --> 06:27.700
And I go, "Lovey? Gigi?"
And she was like, "No."

06:27.700 --> 06:31.200
And she goes, "My grandma that
Zootopia."

06:31.200 --> 06:33.633
- Caitlyn.
- Oh.

06:33.633 --> 06:36.067
So I was thinking I
didn't even think Caitlyn was a

06:36.067 --> 06:38.600
- grandma, you know?
- Yeah.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.600
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Mom.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.800
- Hello.
- What's happening?

06:42.800 --> 06:45.067
- So I just went outside.
- Yeah?

06:45.067 --> 06:49.567
And there's like four
huge scratches in my driveway.

06:49.567 --> 06:54.800
I have a strict "don't park your
car on my driveway" rule.

06:54.800 --> 06:58.167
And guess what?
Somebody parked on the driveway.

06:58.167 --> 07:01.333
It does not look like a
situation where nobody came on

07:01.333 --> 07:04.667
my driveway.
I'm gonna kill that kid.

07:04.667 --> 07:08.500
I can barely believe that Kim
and Kanye are still living

07:08.500 --> 07:11.133
with me.
There's major boundaries

07:11.133 --> 07:14.200
that are not being observed.
So I'm done.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.233
That's it.
Final straw.

07:16.233 --> 07:18.233
- I'm done.
- I have not parked in

07:18.233 --> 07:20.233
your driveway.
This is the first time in six

07:20.233 --> 07:22.233
- months.
- It's people that I

07:22.233 --> 07:24.733
think have drug stuff out of the
garage on your behalf and

07:24.733 --> 07:27.100
- scraped it across the floor.
- What would they be

07:27.100 --> 07:29.100
- dragging?
- Dead bodies.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.100
She has racks in the
garage with all of her clothes

07:31.100 --> 07:32.800
- on them.
- But they have

07:32.800 --> 07:34.533
- wheels.
- No, I don't think

07:34.533 --> 07:36.200
- they have wheels.
- Yeah, they do.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.867
They're not those
kind of racks.

07:37.867 --> 07:39.533
Yeah, they are.
All my racks...

07:39.533 --> 07:41.533
All the standing racks
with all your bags on them?

07:41.533 --> 07:43.367
- Yep.
- Kim, you know, if this

07:43.367 --> 07:46.333
was the other way around, you
guys would want me to be more

07:46.333 --> 07:48.633
respectful.
You know, you guys like to live

07:48.633 --> 07:52.533
exactly a certain way in your
own homes, so why am I, like,

07:52.533 --> 07:55.833
being sort of ignored for the
things that I like in my hou--?

07:55.833 --> 07:57.833
Look what Scott
sent.

07:57.833 --> 07:59.933
- Oh, my God.
- That's so cute.

07:59.933 --> 08:01.933
So, wait here's--
All right, well, I'll

08:01.933 --> 08:03.933
have to check camera footage,
but the least you could... guys

08:03.933 --> 08:05.933
do is be a little respectful of
my driveway.

08:05.933 --> 08:08.800
I just built this gorgeous
driveway and it took me nine

08:08.800 --> 08:11.033
months and I just would like it
if you just...

08:11.033 --> 08:13.633
That one kind of
looks like Mason.

08:13.633 --> 08:16.267
...paid attention to
me.

08:16.267 --> 08:19.933
My mom is insane.
She won't let anyone drive on

08:19.933 --> 08:22.167
the driveway.
They have to park in the dirt

08:22.167 --> 08:24.167
and get a ticket every single
day.

08:24.167 --> 08:26.167
It's literally like this every
single day.

08:26.167 --> 08:28.167
- Like what?
- Like she comes up with

08:28.167 --> 08:30.167
something different.
Like the washing machine broke,

08:30.167 --> 08:32.167
- and it's all my fault.
- She tells me.

08:32.167 --> 08:34.167
- She tells me all the time.
- She literally, it's so--

08:34.167 --> 08:36.600
The chef broke my
pots and pans and my stove.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.467
It's like--
And she just tells

08:39.467 --> 08:41.633
me thing after thing after
thing.

08:41.633 --> 08:43.867
I literally deal
with this every day.

08:43.867 --> 08:46.267
It's, like, always something.
Like, literally, there's

08:46.267 --> 08:56.033
something wrong every single
day.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.667
- This is fun.
Mm-hmm.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.067
Oh, wait, let me see that video
for a good laugh.

09:05.067 --> 09:07.067
Oh, and then I got to
really show you a good funny

09:07.067 --> 09:07.967
one.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.600
Find me a funny
one, please.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.933
Okay.

09:12.933 --> 09:16.100
Hold on. My friend just sent me
something on Chyna.

09:16.100 --> 09:20.167
"Bitch, bye.
Follow cooking with Chyna.

09:20.167 --> 09:22.967
Infatuated with chai."
Like, why is that?

09:22.967 --> 09:24.967
Oh, 'cause Kylie
just put a thing on Instagram

09:24.967 --> 09:28.333
- about cooking with Kylie.
- On what did... Where?

09:28.333 --> 09:31.667
- On her app.
- Kylie loves to cook and

09:31.667 --> 09:34.700
loves to bake, so as soon as
Kylie posts this video, Rob's

09:34.700 --> 09:38.900
girlfriend, who had her own
cooking show, got upset.

09:38.900 --> 09:41.633
Hey, did you just see what Chyna
posted?

09:41.633 --> 09:44.333
What do I do?
What do we do about this?

09:44.333 --> 09:46.667
Just ignore it.
Don't do anything back.

09:46.667 --> 09:50.033
Like, Khloe, if you say ignore
it, she always has to do an

09:50.033 --> 09:53.233
Instagram tweet or something as
a dig.

09:53.233 --> 09:55.833
- So don't, like...
- No, I never dig.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.500
I was willing to talk
to her.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.767
I said, I have... I'm going on
vacation and I have to, like,

10:00.767 --> 10:04.300
you know, I need more time.
I never left them, like,

10:04.300 --> 10:06.667
- thinking negatively.
- Yeah, like, we were

10:06.667 --> 10:08.400
close.
We were actually talking about

10:08.400 --> 10:11.400
- talking to her.
- Yeah.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.533
I think that Mom needs
to, like, talk to her or

10:13.533 --> 10:15.300
something.
I don't know what's going on.

10:15.300 --> 10:18.067
- I think so, too.
- I've never paid her

10:18.067 --> 10:21.333
any mind or had any fight with
her over social media.

10:21.333 --> 10:23.367
I didn't know you had a cooking
Instagram.

10:23.367 --> 10:28.000
- I don't stalk your life.
- Kylie, Tyga, Chyna, Rob,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.500
like, all the drama, it's too
messy.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.500
I'm calling my brother right
now.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.667
The fact that my brother would
allow his girlfriend to talk so

10:35.667 --> 10:38.767
bad about his little sister
publicly, isn't cool.

10:38.767 --> 10:40.267
Sorry, the

10:40.267 --> 10:42.267
person you are trying to reach
has a voicemail box that has not

10:42.267 --> 10:48.433
- been set up yet.
- So not cool.

10:48.433 --> 10:52.033
- Did you see Rob's Instagram?
- That's  up.

10:52.033 --> 10:53.533
There's no beef between
us all.

10:53.533 --> 10:58.733
I'm like, "There's a beef now."
I walk in and my room is empty.

10:58.733 --> 11:00.533
All the furniture's been moved
out.

11:00.533 --> 11:03.267
We have lived with my mom way
too long.

11:03.267 --> 11:05.700
It's just, like, ridiculous.
It's very clear she wants us to

11:05.700 --> 11:09.533
leave.
You have created some drama that

11:09.533 --> 11:12.033
you need to get yourself out of.
My brother should just be

11:12.033 --> 11:13.533
- respectful.
- I didn't know what to

11:13.533 --> 11:15.033
- make of it.
- Well, you obviously

11:15.033 --> 11:23.100
- didn't understand the humor.
- All right.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.867
She looks so good.

11:39.167 --> 11:41.667
She literally has the best body!
I cannot wait to get in shape

11:41.667 --> 11:44.500
- now.
- I am doing a photo

11:44.500 --> 11:47.900
magazine.
I am super excited about it.

11:47.900 --> 11:50.733
- Great! There!
- I need to work out

11:50.733 --> 11:54.067
consistently, and I have not
been as religious as I once was.

11:54.067 --> 11:56.233
- Nice!
- But do I embrace my

11:56.233 --> 11:59.500
curves and just say  it?
Sure. It is what it is.

11:59.500 --> 12:03.867
- You are so inspiring me.
- Thank you for coming.

12:03.867 --> 12:08.500
Of course.
Wait, did you see, um...

12:08.500 --> 12:11.533
- Rob's Instagram?
- Yeah, that's

12:11.533 --> 12:14.633
- up.
- It's so crazy, right?

12:14.633 --> 12:16.967
Rob has been publicly
posting memes about if the

12:16.967 --> 12:20.200
is that good, he'd
rather be an orphan.

12:20.200 --> 12:24.500
Like, to me, that's not funny.
So I called him, and he said,

12:24.500 --> 12:27.833
"Oh, it's just a funny meme."
There's no beef between us all.

12:27.833 --> 12:30.133
I love you guys."
I'm like, "There's a beef now."

12:30.133 --> 12:33.200
He's so annoying.
I have reached out to Rob

12:33.200 --> 12:35.967
a few times.
Rob is too busy to respond to

12:35.967 --> 12:39.633
me, but he's not too busy to
post a  meme.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.767
- That's so unnecessary.
- I just need a break from

12:41.767 --> 12:43.767
- him.
- Yeah.

12:43.767 --> 12:45.267
What is this shoot for,
Shape?

12:45.267 --> 12:48.300
- It's so good. Like, honestly...
- What's on your jacket,

12:48.300 --> 12:50.333
- Kim?
- Me.

12:50.333 --> 12:53.167
- Oh. Totally normal.
- And me.

12:53.167 --> 12:55.100
- And me, and me.
- Oh.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.833
Oh...

13:07.200 --> 13:11.067
Oh, yes, Tina!
You looked so cute when you wore

13:11.067 --> 13:13.100
that baseball hat and that red
jacket.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.367
You looked like a down-ass
bitch.

13:18.033 --> 13:19.767
Mom's so
annoying.

13:19.767 --> 13:23.567
- I walk in and my room is empty.
- What do you mean?

13:23.567 --> 13:25.967
All the furniture has
been moved out.

13:25.967 --> 13:27.967
But wh... why is your
stuff out?

13:27.967 --> 13:29.467
'Cause she gave it to
Rob.

13:29.467 --> 13:32.533
And I was like, "Um, excuse me?
Are you gonna tell me that

13:32.533 --> 13:35.400
you've emptied out my room?"
And Kanye walks in and goes,

13:35.400 --> 13:38.033
"Okay, it's very clear she wants
us to leave."

13:38.033 --> 13:41.967
I know we have lived with my mom
way too long-- I totally get

13:41.967 --> 13:45.833
it-- but I have six weeks left
until we are gonna move into our

13:45.833 --> 13:48.700
house, and she's pretty much
kicked her daughter out of

13:48.700 --> 13:50.700
her room.
She could have waited a few more

13:50.700 --> 13:53.000
weeks.
So it's the furniture that was

13:53.000 --> 13:55.400
- in your bedroom.
- Yeah. She claims that

13:55.400 --> 13:57.400
- was his furniture.
- That's not true.

13:57.400 --> 14:01.300
- No.
- She just lies and lies

14:01.300 --> 14:03.967
and lies.
Own up. Like, let's just be

14:03.967 --> 14:13.067
- honest about what you're doing.
- I know.

14:13.067 --> 14:15.067
So what exactly are
you doing?

14:15.067 --> 14:18.067
So you know your
stomach goes  six

14:18.067 --> 14:20.067
times?
When you get it all tightened

14:20.067 --> 14:23.400
up, you feel, like, so good
about yourself, and then you

14:23.400 --> 14:25.400
turn 50.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.733
Thanks for giving me
something to look forward to.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.767
So how are you
guys doing?

14:29.767 --> 14:32.100
- We're good.
- It's really not

14:32.100 --> 14:35.433
as bad as you imagine it to be.
So the CoolSculpting is a great

14:35.433 --> 14:37.767
treatment.
It's going to freeze the fat.

14:37.767 --> 14:40.767
The treatment is FDA cleared.
And it lasts a very, very long

14:40.767 --> 14:42.767
- time.
- So you're, like, so

14:42.767 --> 14:45.100
naturally gorgeous and perfect,
can you imagine having to do all

14:45.100 --> 14:47.767
- this stuff?
- It's so interesting

14:47.767 --> 14:50.767
- to watch, to be honest.
- Appreciate your abs,

14:50.767 --> 14:52.767
- honey.
- Wait, on another

14:52.767 --> 14:55.100
note, how crazy is it that
Kourtney and Kylie come out to

14:55.100 --> 14:58.100
the city and don't call me when
they come out?

14:58.100 --> 15:00.433
And I'm the only one that lives
out here-- I live right down the

15:00.433 --> 15:03.133
- street-- and they don't call me.
- Sometimes you just get

15:03.133 --> 15:05.467
really busy, and you have time
to do one thing, you know?

15:05.467 --> 15:07.467
No, 'cause it's not
like that.

15:07.467 --> 15:09.467
It's like they come out here,
and they go out.

15:09.467 --> 15:13.133
Like, out to, like, restaurants
and places.

15:13.133 --> 15:15.800
And then a couple days later,
Kylie came out here to go

15:15.800 --> 15:17.633
shopping, but her phone "wasn't
working."

15:17.633 --> 15:19.533
They made excuses.

15:21.467 --> 15:24.800
I'm in town, and I had to find
out through social media that my

15:24.800 --> 15:27.800
sisters are out in the city,
having fun without me.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.467
Like, I already told Kourtney
that this annoys me, and now it

15:30.467 --> 15:32.467
just sucks even more that it
happened again.

15:32.467 --> 15:35.467
I don't want to be, like,
forgotten just 'cause I work

15:35.467 --> 15:36.967
a lot.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
My mom, I'm gonna kill
her.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.333
My mom is claiming that it's our
fault that she has roaches in

15:45.333 --> 15:47.333
her pantry.
This is it.

15:47.333 --> 15:51.667
- I cannot take this anymore.
- Rob texted me, talking

15:51.667 --> 15:53.667
- about how he wants to move.
- Why does he hate his

15:53.667 --> 15:55.667
house?
I have no idea what my brother's

15:55.667 --> 15:57.667
- thinking.
- I need to call Mom

15:57.667 --> 16:04.767
right now.
She should have never done that.

16:10.633 --> 16:17.967
Hey.

16:17.967 --> 16:19.967
You're so cute.
You look like a little kid

16:19.967 --> 16:21.967
- today.
- I have zero makeup

16:21.967 --> 16:23.967
- on.
- That's why you look

16:23.967 --> 16:27.967
like a little kid today.
You haven't done your glam yet.

16:27.967 --> 16:30.300
- Probably.
- We're getting ready to

16:30.300 --> 16:34.967
- go with Kylie's Lip Kit.
- Um, alrighty.

16:34.967 --> 16:37.967
I just wanted you to
wish your sister luck.

16:37.967 --> 16:41.300
- Good luck, sister.
- Have a little more

16:41.300 --> 16:45.333
- enthusiasm.
- Good luck!

16:45.333 --> 16:47.667
I wish Kylie would have told me
that she was doing her lipstick

16:47.667 --> 16:50.000
launch, 'cause I would have,
like, cleared my schedule and

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
made sure that I could have been
there.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I'm frustrated just 'cause
everyone has so much going on.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
- I feel like I'm missing it.
- Love you.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.767
Okay, bye.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.700
- Hey.
- What is this place?

17:15.700 --> 17:17.400
It's just a rental
I got.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.067
I'm just keeping this one for a
month for now.

17:19.067 --> 17:20.733
- Fancy.
- Yeah. By the way,

17:20.733 --> 17:22.400
you know my birthday is on
Sunday?

17:22.400 --> 17:24.067
- Yeah.
- I hope you planned

17:24.067 --> 17:25.733
- something.
- We got it planned.

17:25.733 --> 17:27.400
- Don't worry.
- I love it.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.400
I feel like I've spent the last
seven birthdays with you.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.400
- Yeah, it'll be fun.
- Birthdays and,

17:32.400 --> 17:34.400
- like, almost all Halloweens.
- What are we gonna do

17:34.400 --> 17:35.667
this Halloween?
I feel like I'll be skinny

17:35.667 --> 17:36.867
- again.
- Yeah, you need

17:36.867 --> 17:38.733
- to, like...
- I can wear some, like,

17:38.733 --> 17:40.733
fun costume.
What can we do that's, like,

17:40.733 --> 17:43.067
still cool?
'Cause Kanye doesn't really do

17:43.067 --> 17:45.067
- Halloween.
- Yeah, we just have

17:45.067 --> 17:47.633
- to pretty much keep him Kanye.
- Yeah.

17:47.633 --> 17:50.567
It'd be fun if you
came out as Amber Rose.

17:50.567 --> 17:52.900
You would kill it.
That would be the best thing

17:52.900 --> 17:54.833
ever.
'Cause he could still stay

17:54.833 --> 17:56.900
- Kanye.
- And Kylie could be

17:56.900 --> 17:59.767
- Chyna.
- And Tyga could just

17:59.767 --> 18:01.367
stay Tyga... like, he doesn't
have to switch.

18:01.367 --> 18:03.367
- Yes!
- You'll be Amber and

18:03.367 --> 18:05.067
- Chyna.
- Oh, my God, that would

18:05.067 --> 18:06.900
be so funny.

18:06.900 --> 18:08.333
You could put the
red shades on, with the, with

18:08.333 --> 18:09.933
- the stripes.
- Yeah.

18:09.933 --> 18:12.367
That would be the
best thing.

18:12.367 --> 18:14.300
My mom... I'm gonna kill
her.

18:14.300 --> 18:16.433
- Why?
- "So my chef told me that

18:16.433 --> 18:18.867
now we have roaches in our
pantry because of all of the

18:18.867 --> 18:20.533
messes in there.
No one cleans up after

18:20.533 --> 18:22.567
themselves and it's such a
pigsty."

18:22.567 --> 18:26.267
So  annoying.
Honestly, my mom is accusing me

18:26.267 --> 18:29.400
of everything.
I mean, cockroaches in the

18:29.400 --> 18:32.200
pantry?
She's insane.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.967
No one has even eaten there or
uses food in the pantry.

18:35.967 --> 18:38.333
You know my mom, like, makes up
lies.

18:38.333 --> 18:40.667
She's like, "Oh, um..." like,
"Oh, you broke this."

18:40.667 --> 18:42.033
She's sick, let's
nail her.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.533
I think it's just, like,
ridiculous.

18:43.533 --> 18:45.833
Like, I cannot take this
anymore.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.967
All right, I need to tell Kanye.

18:49.967 --> 18:53.033
Hey, you're on speaker.
My mom is claiming that it's our

18:53.033 --> 18:55.333
fault that she has roaches in
her pantry.

18:55.333 --> 18:57.233
Can we stay at the
Four Seasons tonight, 'cause

18:57.233 --> 18:59.900
- I don't feel like going home.
- Bear with me.

18:59.900 --> 19:01.600
I don't want to sleep
at my mother-in-law's house just

19:01.600 --> 19:04.500
- tonight.
- Hey, how amazing is this

19:04.500 --> 19:07.433
idea?
For Halloween this year, what if

19:07.433 --> 19:12.700
you were you and I was Amber,
and then Kylie was Chyna and

19:12.700 --> 19:16.433
- Tyga was Tyga?
- Yeah, I think that's

19:16.433 --> 19:17.967
- lit.
- Isn't that...

19:17.967 --> 19:19.867
Lit! Now tell him
whose idea it was, now that he

19:19.867 --> 19:22.167
- said it's lit.
- It was my idea...

19:22.167 --> 19:24.467
- Yeah, right.
- It's gonna be so lit.

19:24.467 --> 19:34.400
So lit!

19:34.400 --> 19:37.100
Hey, Mom.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.800
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.667
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

19:40.667 --> 19:44.500
I'm feeling a little bit sick.
Mason has been sick and I feel

19:44.500 --> 19:46.333
like I'm getting it a little
bit.

19:46.333 --> 19:48.367
- That's not good, honey.
- Yeah, we're going

19:48.367 --> 19:51.500
- to this doctor today.
- I was talking to

19:51.500 --> 19:56.000
Kendall about home and she said,
"I miss anything in an American

19:56.000 --> 19:59.967
market," like grilled cheese and
the stuff she likes to...

19:59.967 --> 20:02.533
Well, tell her to
come to my house and be

20:02.533 --> 20:05.100
gluten-free, dairy-free and see
how she feels.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.233
She'd probably miss her

20:07.233 --> 20:10.700
house.
She's so overwhelmed and she's

20:10.700 --> 20:15.333
been watching you guys, I think,
on, you know, social media or

20:15.333 --> 20:18.733
Instagram or whatever and she...
I think she's feeling really

20:18.733 --> 20:21.967
- left out and she feels like...
- Yeah.

20:21.967 --> 20:23.867
...she misses you so
much.

20:23.867 --> 20:26.167
After the last show, she started
crying.

20:26.167 --> 20:29.500
I felt so bad.
She was like, "I miss my sisters

20:29.500 --> 20:33.100
so much," and I...
It just broke my heart, because

20:33.100 --> 20:37.300
she's so homesick.
Kendall can be really sensitive,

20:37.300 --> 20:40.967
but she doesn't always show it,
so I think it's really important

20:40.967 --> 20:44.833
that the girls give Kendall a
little extra love when she's

20:44.833 --> 20:48.333
back in town, and maybe surprise
her with something fabulous.

20:48.333 --> 20:50.967
- There's nothing like family.
- I'm gonna be with

20:50.967 --> 20:52.800
Kim; so I'll talk to her
about it.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.900
Okay.
That would mean so much to her,

20:54.900 --> 20:58.700
Kourt, you have no idea.
All right, well, I love you.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.167
- Love you!
- Okay. Me, too.

21:00.167 --> 21:11.900
- I can't wait to see you.
- Love you.

21:11.900 --> 21:14.200
For fun, you want to do
the face swap?

21:14.200 --> 21:16.067
Mm-hmm.
- Ooh, there, I look

21:16.067 --> 21:19.433
really good right there.
I think this is the best face

21:19.433 --> 21:21.267
- swap ever.
- I've always wanted to

21:21.267 --> 21:23.400
look like you.
Hey, Kylie.

21:23.400 --> 21:27.100
- Hey, Kim.
- Oh, my God!

21:27.100 --> 21:29.400
That was your tongue that came

21:29.400 --> 21:31.933
out of my mouth.
Your tongue just came out of my

21:31.933 --> 21:35.700
- mouth.
- That is so funny.

21:35.700 --> 21:39.800
- That is so weird.
- Rob texted me.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.433
- Saying what?
- Last night.

21:41.433 --> 21:43.600
Talking about how he wants to
move.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.300
He texted me and said, "Does
Tyga want to buy my house?

21:46.300 --> 21:48.367
I hate it, I'm out."
Why does he hate his

21:48.367 --> 21:51.200
house?
I have no idea what my brother's

21:51.200 --> 21:53.367
thinking.
I mean, my mom literally just

21:53.367 --> 21:56.167
helped him move into a new house
and now he says he doesn't want

21:56.167 --> 21:59.467
the house anymore.
I mean, as crazy as my mom is

21:59.467 --> 22:03.000
right now, I don't know why he's
being so crazy mean to her.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.300
I said, "Robert, why
you gotta let Mom get all

22:05.300 --> 22:07.867
disrespected?
That's so hurtful to my mom."

22:07.867 --> 22:10.300
"Let me get happy and
the rest will follow."

22:10.300 --> 22:12.967
Dude.
I need to call Mom right now.

22:12.967 --> 22:17.533
- She should never have done that.
- I know.

22:17.533 --> 22:21.633
Don't tell my mom.
It's a surprise, okay?

22:21.633 --> 22:24.933
My mom was trying to pull a fast
one on me, but I will definitely

22:24.933 --> 22:27.033
- show her.
- Seriously?

22:27.033 --> 22:30.800
- Aw...
- Mom said Kendall's,

22:30.800 --> 22:32.933
like, so homesick and that she
was crying...

22:32.933 --> 22:34.767
Kendall feels left out.
I feel like we should do

22:34.767 --> 22:36.633
something.

22:48.933 --> 22:51.367
It's so funny that Mom
literally copies everything

22:51.367 --> 22:53.733
- I do.
- Like what?

22:53.733 --> 22:55.800
She, like, wore a
baseball hat and Yeezys.

22:55.800 --> 22:59.133
And I wore that this weekend.
Literally every photo is a

22:59.133 --> 23:01.700
different baseball hat and
Yeezys.

23:01.700 --> 23:04.067
Um, so I talked to
Mom.

23:04.067 --> 23:07.200
She just said how Kendall's,
like, so homesick and that she

23:07.200 --> 23:09.567
was crying and I was like, "I
haven't even heard from her,

23:09.567 --> 23:12.167
like, once."
But it would be nice for us to

23:12.167 --> 23:16.700
do something for her.
Like, remember, like, when we'd

23:16.700 --> 23:20.567
go to, like, sleepaway camp?
And you'd come home and, like...

23:20.567 --> 23:22.100
- Yeah.
- ...everyone would

23:22.100 --> 23:23.767
- kind of, like, welcome you home?
- Yeah.

23:23.767 --> 23:25.600
I feel like it's
like, when you're an adult and

23:25.600 --> 23:28.300
you have a job and, like, you
come home, like, no cares.

23:28.300 --> 23:30.133
No one... yeah.
We should do, like...

23:30.133 --> 23:31.867
- So...
- ...a CARE package and

23:31.867 --> 23:35.000
we'll be, like, her welcoming
committee.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.833
Yeah.
I mean, we could stock her place

23:37.833 --> 23:41.833
with, like, her favorite stuff
and do, like, a girls' night in.

23:41.833 --> 23:48.300
And just, like, just get her,
like, excited.

23:48.300 --> 23:51.767
It does make me sad to hear that
Kendall feels left out.

23:51.767 --> 23:55.333
I feel like when she's gone, I
never hear from her, so I just

23:55.333 --> 23:58.033
assume that she's having the
time of her life.

23:58.033 --> 24:00.767
We definitely miss Kendall when
she's gone and I think that we

24:00.767 --> 24:03.733
should do something so that she
knows that.

24:03.733 --> 24:07.133
Mom said all she talks about is,
like, going to the...

24:07.133 --> 24:10.767
- an American grocery store.
- I haven't been to a

24:10.767 --> 24:12.733
grocery store in, like,
four years.

24:12.733 --> 24:14.867
- Yeah.
- I just don't even know

24:14.867 --> 24:17.667
what flavor deodorants they have
anymore.

24:17.667 --> 24:19.567
What?

24:29.467 --> 24:31.967
Just tell me if
this is a good background.

24:31.967 --> 24:35.433
Okay.
Good.

24:35.433 --> 24:37.433
What is she doing,
exactly?

24:37.433 --> 24:39.100
We're just doing
two more photos.

24:39.100 --> 24:41.233
- Don't you look at my Instagram?
- No.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.833
- Hello?
- Hi.

24:46.833 --> 24:49.300
- Hi.
- So I'm just letting

24:49.300 --> 24:52.333
you know that I'm about to take
Mom to lunch.

24:52.333 --> 24:55.833
Today is the day that Kim is
going to surprise my mom by

24:55.833 --> 25:00.367
moving out of my mom's house,
finally, and so she's asked me

25:00.367 --> 25:04.400
to distract my mom.
I'm going to try and buy Kim as

25:04.400 --> 25:06.967
- much time as possible.
- Okay, bye.

25:06.967 --> 25:09.967
Bye.
Mom, do you think my stomach

25:09.967 --> 25:13.400
looks wrinkly?
Like an old lady stomach?

25:13.400 --> 25:16.767
And does it look better if it's
sucked in or not sucked in?

25:16.767 --> 25:19.133
Well, it always looks
better...

25:19.133 --> 25:22.167
No, not sucked in
is better... Hmm.

25:22.167 --> 25:24.233
Okay, let's go.
Ready?

25:24.233 --> 25:25.333
Yeah.

25:31.933 --> 25:35.467
She's out of the house

25:35.467 --> 25:39.000
for a few more hours.
Everything on a moving truck.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
- Okay, boss.
- Thank you.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.800
Kourtney is in charge of keeping
my mom busy today.

25:43.800 --> 25:46.333
They just got their nails done
and now they're on their way to

25:46.333 --> 25:48.133
- go get lunch.
- I have your tray of

25:48.133 --> 25:49.600
- jewelry.
- Okay.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.267
- We have our cribs.
Mm-hmm.

25:51.267 --> 25:53.800
Kanye and I and the kids
are gonna move temporarily into

25:53.800 --> 25:56.833
our Bel Air home.
We don't have a lot of time

25:56.833 --> 25:59.133
before everything has to be
packed and moved out of the

25:59.133 --> 26:02.367
house, so it's so stressful
trying to hurry up and get this

26:02.367 --> 26:04.833
all done.
I feel like I need to take some

26:04.833 --> 26:06.733
more Advil.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.333
- Come on, boush!
- Her braids are so cute.

26:16.333 --> 26:18.367
Mom, what are
these?

26:18.367 --> 26:20.400
That's kind of rotten,
boo-boo.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.767
I think it's
pretend.

26:21.767 --> 26:23.633
Oh.

26:23.633 --> 26:25.600
- Looks real to me.
- Do you pretend

26:25.600 --> 26:27.967
- to eat this?
- Yeah.

26:27.967 --> 26:30.800
Oh, wait.
Is this one real?

26:30.800 --> 26:33.833
No.

26:33.833 --> 26:37.467
- Know what?
- Thank you.

26:37.467 --> 26:40.500
Kylie keeps talking to me about
kind of burning out and I'm a

26:40.500 --> 26:42.500
- little worried.
- I mean, she's never

26:42.500 --> 26:44.333
alone.
She always has her friends with

26:44.333 --> 26:45.800
- her.
Mm-hmm.

26:45.800 --> 26:49.800
I love to be alone.
I really like... my quiet time.

26:49.800 --> 26:53.467
And it... I recharge and...
I haven't had a meal to myself

26:53.467 --> 26:55.800
- in three years.
Mm-hmm.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.800
- Um...
- The house has never

26:57.800 --> 26:59.800
- been empty.
- Really?

26:59.800 --> 27:02.133
Yeah.
They change diapers, like

27:02.133 --> 27:04.800
throw-up babies and dogs that
pee.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.133
- It's all day long.
Mm-hmm.

27:07.133 --> 27:11.467
My mom is nonstop complaining
about Kim in the house.

27:11.467 --> 27:14.133
I mean, one of my
favorite things to do is, like,

27:14.133 --> 27:17.167
stay in bed all day on a Sunday,
and have my computer and my

27:17.167 --> 27:19.167
- books and my magazines.
Mm-hmm.

27:19.167 --> 27:22.500
This is thankfully the last
lunch I'm gonna have to sit

27:22.500 --> 27:24.833
- through listening to this.
- Oh, my God, it's

27:24.833 --> 27:27.500
- unbearable.
- Yeah. Mm.

27:27.500 --> 27:30.833
Kim better move quickly, because
there's only so much of this

27:30.833 --> 27:31.733
I can take.

27:36.333 --> 27:38.667
Guys, we're running
out of space.

27:38.667 --> 27:40.667
Gonna have to wait for another
truck.

27:40.667 --> 27:42.667
Not possible today.
Not possible.

27:42.667 --> 27:45.667
There is so much stuff to move
and just not enough time, so I'm

27:45.667 --> 27:48.000
kind of, like, freaking out.
We have to make it work.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.367
Anything in the garage, they
need to empty it.

27:51.367 --> 27:54.700
My mom was definitely trying to
pull a fast one on me by moving

27:54.700 --> 27:58.700
me out, but I will definitely
show her who the queen of

27:58.700 --> 28:02.033
surprises is.
I think she's gonna be sad.

28:02.033 --> 28:04.700
- She'll be sad.
- But she'll run around

28:04.700 --> 28:08.700
- the house naked.
- Mama!

28:08.700 --> 28:10.700
- Huh?
- After can we make

28:10.700 --> 28:14.033
something with paint at Color Me
Mine?

28:14.033 --> 28:16.033
Let's see how much
time we have.

28:16.033 --> 28:19.367
Uh-oh.
It's been a long day, Kourtney.

28:19.367 --> 28:21.700
- I'm gonna head home now.
- Huh.

28:21.700 --> 28:25.067
Yeah.
So, P, can you drive me home?

28:25.067 --> 28:28.400
- No.
- Do you drive yet, P?

28:28.400 --> 28:30.400
- No.
- Are you sure?

28:30.400 --> 28:32.400
- No.
- When are you gonna

28:32.400 --> 28:34.400
- drive?
- When I'm five.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.400
- Five?
- Yeah.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.067
Oh, five.
Will you drive me to the mall

28:38.067 --> 28:39.733
- when you're five?
Mm-hmm.

28:39.733 --> 28:41.733
- Thank you.
- Are you not coming

28:41.733 --> 28:43.400
- in here?
- No.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.400
I'm going in my car.
I'm gonna go home.

28:45.400 --> 28:48.400
Okay.
Okay, let me call KiKi really

28:48.400 --> 28:51.067
quick.

28:51.067 --> 28:53.067
- Hello?
- Hi.

28:53.067 --> 28:56.433
- Hi.
- Um, so we just had

28:56.433 --> 29:00.100
lunch, we just finished.
So she's going straight home.

29:00.100 --> 29:02.100
So I'm sure she'll be there
soon.

29:02.100 --> 29:05.433
Oh, my God.
They distracted my mom as long

29:05.433 --> 29:09.767
as possible, so hopefully we can
finish the move.

29:09.767 --> 29:12.133
Okay, so, uh,
that's my update, I guess.

29:12.133 --> 29:13.467
Okay, bye.

29:15.433 --> 29:17.100
Okay, hurry, guys.
She's coming.

29:17.100 --> 29:18.433
Hurry.

29:20.433 --> 29:23.100
We are so close.
She cannot come till the moving

29:23.100 --> 29:30.133
truck's gone, or the surprise
will be totally ruined.

29:30.133 --> 29:32.133
We never not want
to hang out with you.

29:32.133 --> 29:34.133
I just always think you're out
of town.

29:34.133 --> 29:36.467
We really want her to know how
valuable she is.

29:36.467 --> 29:42.333
We just never want you to feel,
like, alienated.

29:42.333 --> 29:45.000
I-I don't really want
to deal with Rob right now.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.733
It is hard to see
my mom so upset.

29:47.733 --> 29:54.200
And it's hurting my
family.

29:54.200 --> 29:57.200
She cannot come till the
moving truck's gone, or the

29:57.200 --> 29:58.800
surprise will be totally ruined.

30:03.567 --> 30:06.567
- You look cute.
- Hey, thanks.

30:06.567 --> 30:08.900
- Guess what.
- What?

30:08.900 --> 30:12.900
Not one of my things
resides in this home anymore.

30:12.900 --> 30:17.567
I spent the entire day moving
into my Bel Air house.

30:17.567 --> 30:20.233
Stop!
Seriously?

30:20.233 --> 30:22.233
Wait a second.
Wait, you really moved out of

30:22.233 --> 30:24.233
- here?
- Oh yeah.

30:24.233 --> 30:27.233
- Oh yeah.
- Aw...

30:27.233 --> 30:29.900
What?!
Oh...

30:29.900 --> 30:32.567
My child moved out.
Wait, your clothes are really

30:32.567 --> 30:34.567
- gone.
- Everything's gone.

30:34.567 --> 30:36.600
It's all moved.
The kids' beds.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.600
- There's no cribs.
- There's no cribs?

30:38.600 --> 30:40.933
- Everything's gone.
- How did you know that

30:40.933 --> 30:42.933
- I was gonna be gone all day?
- I planned it, honey.

30:42.933 --> 30:46.600
Wow.
I feel like a teenager that just

30:46.600 --> 30:49.267
got their own house.
It's amazing.

30:49.267 --> 30:52.600
This is a big day.
Aw...

30:52.600 --> 30:55.933
- I'm gonna miss my roommate.
- Maybe tomorrow we'll

30:55.933 --> 30:57.933
have everyone come over and see
the house.

30:57.933 --> 31:00.267
I would love to.
This is probably one of the

31:00.267 --> 31:03.933
happiest days of my life.
I can't imagine a better

31:03.933 --> 31:06.600
surprise.
I think it was thoughtful that

31:06.600 --> 31:09.933
she decided to move out and
give me some privacy.

31:09.933 --> 31:14.300
I haven't even let it sink in
yet, but... this is amazing.

31:14.300 --> 31:17.300
Enjoy your house.
Your first night alone.

31:17.300 --> 31:20.633
Oh, my God.

31:20.633 --> 31:22.533
Bye! I love you!

31:24.633 --> 31:27.633
I got my house back!

31:27.633 --> 31:30.433
Yes!

31:30.433 --> 31:32.333
Love it!

31:44.733 --> 31:49.067
- Mom, where's Lovey?
- She's coming.

31:49.067 --> 31:51.733
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Mom.

31:51.733 --> 31:54.400
- How's everybody doing?
- Good.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.400
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:56.400 --> 31:59.400
You have no idea how
amazing it is to have an empty

31:59.400 --> 32:02.733
house.
Oh, I feel... I feel so good.

32:02.733 --> 32:06.067
Mm-hmm.
Wait, what's up with Rob and

32:06.067 --> 32:08.400
- Chyna?
- You know, actually, I

32:08.400 --> 32:11.733
don't really want to deal with
Rob right now, because they, you

32:11.733 --> 32:15.400
know, went on his Instagram and
posted all these pictures making

32:15.400 --> 32:17.933
fun of the food that I bought.
Just because it's really

32:17.933 --> 32:22.500
healthy.
And it really hurt my feelings.

32:22.500 --> 32:24.500
What the  is
this?

32:24.500 --> 32:27.500
I tried to do a really
good job at stocking Rob's

32:27.500 --> 32:31.833
pantry with some healthy food,
so I'm kind of shocked that he's

32:31.833 --> 32:34.167
making fun of what I just did
for him.

32:34.167 --> 32:36.833
- What?!
- I know that the posts

32:36.833 --> 32:40.500
are just about food, but it just
hurts my feelings because it

32:40.500 --> 32:44.833
took a lot of time and effort to
make sure that it was all

32:44.833 --> 32:48.500
perfect for Rob, and so I'm not
sure where it's coming from.

32:48.500 --> 32:51.867
That pantry has to be stocked
for several different family

32:51.867 --> 32:53.867
members.
It's not just Rob.

32:53.867 --> 32:55.867
So shoot me 'cause we like
quinoa.

32:55.867 --> 32:59.867
He loves a supportive, loving,
fabulous family.

32:59.867 --> 33:01.867
I don't get where this is coming
from.

33:01.867 --> 33:05.533
He's just so defensive.
So I don't know what to do.

33:05.533 --> 33:09.867
But your dad would have expected
more out of Rob.

33:09.867 --> 33:14.200
It is hard to see,
you know, my mom so upset over

33:14.200 --> 33:17.867
Rob's posts.
And it's just a hard situation.

33:17.867 --> 33:21.200
- My mom does so much for him.
- Kourtney, what should I

33:21.200 --> 33:24.233
do about him?
I'm just so confused.

33:24.233 --> 33:32.000
There's nothing you can do.
And it's hurting my family.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.600
I never get pissed, and
I'm so for you being happy, but

33:35.600 --> 33:37.600
Mom is pissed.
I have to call my brother out

33:37.600 --> 33:39.600
on this.
There's no way I'm gonna let my

33:39.600 --> 33:46.333
- brother disrespect her.
- It's petty as.

33:57.267 --> 34:00.933
Oh yeah, it worked.

34:00.933 --> 34:02.067
Wait, so when does
she come home?

34:02.067 --> 34:03.200
Oh, I did the wrong
way...

34:03.200 --> 34:06.267
How cute, she has Lip
Kits waiting for her that were

34:06.267 --> 34:08.600
mailed to her.
Do you think this is interesting

34:08.600 --> 34:10.933
that both of my kids
left-handed?

34:10.933 --> 34:14.600
- No, that's so great.
- Really?

34:14.600 --> 34:16.933
That means they're
gonna be artsy-fartsy.

34:16.933 --> 34:19.600
- I respect lefties.
- Really?

34:19.600 --> 34:22.267
Kanye was a lefty, but his mom
made him be a righty.

34:22.267 --> 34:24.267
- What?
- In school, they made him

34:24.267 --> 34:26.933
- switch.
- Look at all this...

34:26.933 --> 34:28.933
She doesn't let me unpack the
boxes.

34:28.933 --> 34:30.967
I always ask, "Can I unpack
your boxes?"

34:30.967 --> 34:33.633
She says she likes to do it
herself.

34:33.633 --> 34:35.633
I think we should display it
cute.

34:35.633 --> 34:37.633
Like, look at these dead
flowers.

34:37.633 --> 34:39.633
Like, I want her to have, like,
nice new flowers.

34:39.633 --> 34:42.300
- Where are these from?
- You can't eat her

34:42.300 --> 34:44.633
- stuff that we're getting her.
- Just one bite.

34:44.633 --> 34:47.633
Mmm.
That is so cute.

34:47.633 --> 34:49.633
Okay, what-what do you want me
to say?

34:49.633 --> 34:51.967
Like, "We're so happy
to have you back.

34:51.967 --> 34:55.967
Your sisters missed you.
Here's just a few little

34:55.967 --> 35:00.467
goodies to let you know that
we're obsessed with you."

35:00.467 --> 35:03.667
"Hello, gorgeous.
Welcome back.

35:03.667 --> 35:06.667
We're so happy you are home.
Here are some of your fave

35:06.667 --> 35:10.000
things to welcome you back and
know how much we love you."

35:10.000 --> 35:12.333
Oh, my God, they have pretzel
minis?

35:12.333 --> 35:16.400
Does she really need those?
Just kidding.

35:16.400 --> 35:18.667
Don't you love looking in
people's cabinets?

35:18.667 --> 35:21.000
No.
Shut her cabinets!

35:21.000 --> 35:22.833
- Nermal...
- When you first start

35:22.833 --> 35:36.867
dating a guy, it's, like,
my favorite thing to do.

35:36.867 --> 35:39.333
Hey, okay, come here.
Where should we go?

35:39.333 --> 35:43.867
Let's go in the garage.

35:43.867 --> 35:46.367
- Hey.
- Hey, Rob?

35:46.367 --> 35:49.733
Look, I never get pissed, and I
am so for you being happy,

35:49.733 --> 35:53.033
but whatever Chyna and Kylie and
all the drama that they have

35:53.033 --> 35:55.667
together, like, that's for them
to work out.

35:55.667 --> 36:00.000
Mom has bent over backwards
doing all this stuff...

36:00.000 --> 36:03.433
My mom told me about Rob making
fun of the food that my mom

36:03.433 --> 36:07.167
bought him.
I mean, my mom literally just

36:07.167 --> 36:09.233
helped him move into a new
house.

36:09.233 --> 36:11.267
I have to call my brother out
on this.

36:11.267 --> 36:13.767
Like, there's no way I'm gonna
let my brother disrespect her.

36:13.767 --> 36:16.300
Mom is pissed.
When you start publically

36:16.300 --> 36:19.900
bashing my sister and mom,
that's not cool.

36:19.900 --> 36:22.933
This is just unnecessary.
We just, this is not what our

36:22.933 --> 36:25.267
family does.
Like, there's way too much

36:25.267 --> 36:27.833
drama, so many haters in the
world, we don't need it from

36:27.833 --> 36:30.333
- our own inside circle.
I-I didn't even know

36:30.333 --> 36:33.267
what was going on, first of all.
And I don't even think it's that

36:33.267 --> 36:37.733
- serious.
- Everyone has to just not

36:37.733 --> 36:40.167
be blasting people on
social media.

36:40.167 --> 36:44.533
You two are a unit now, so it
looks like you're blasting mom,

36:44.533 --> 36:46.433
and it's petty as.

36:51.033 --> 36:53.833
You two are a unit now,
so it looks like you're blasting

36:53.833 --> 36:59.267
Mom, and it's petty as.
I just want everyone to be

36:59.267 --> 37:02.733
respectful and to know that the
social media part just makes

37:02.733 --> 37:06.033
everyone look bad, especially
you, and I care about you.

37:06.033 --> 37:08.300
We're not  like
here to hurt anybody.

37:08.300 --> 37:10.633
Okay, all--
We're just here.

37:10.633 --> 37:13.100
- It's like real.
- I  with Chyna.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.167
I like her.
I love her.

37:15.167 --> 37:18.467
She loves me.
I don't want no fighting.

37:18.467 --> 37:20.900
It's a little hard to
see my brother be mean

37:20.900 --> 37:24.033
to my mom.
I mean, as siblings, like, do

37:24.033 --> 37:26.267
we, like, give my mom a hard
time? Totally.

37:26.267 --> 37:29.400
But, like, he really should
just, like, be respectful

37:29.400 --> 37:32.733
and acknowledge that my mom has
put in such hard work for him.

37:32.733 --> 37:34.767
I think he just owes that
to her.

37:34.767 --> 37:36.300
All right, well, we'll
go about it differently.

37:36.300 --> 37:37.867
- I got you.
- I hope so.

37:37.867 --> 37:39.767
- And... I got you.
- Thank you, Rob.

37:39.767 --> 37:41.767
- I really hope so.
- All right.

37:41.767 --> 37:43.933
Just everyone should
just be cool, and we'll talk,

37:43.933 --> 37:46.433
but this was a big setback, and
I didn't want that for you.

37:46.433 --> 37:49.067
I love you and I'm not, you
know, I just think we got to,

37:49.067 --> 37:52.133
like, keep it tighter and not
have this, like, internal

37:52.133 --> 37:54.567
arguing that we bring out to the
world.

37:54.567 --> 37:57.100
Okay.

38:10.067 --> 38:13.833
- Hello?
- Yay!

38:13.833 --> 38:16.967
- Hi.
- You were invited.

38:16.967 --> 38:19.367
All right, you need to learn how
to hug.

38:19.367 --> 38:22.167
When Kylie hugs, we push it in
like this.

38:22.167 --> 38:25.433
- It's, like, really hugging.
- Okay.

38:25.433 --> 38:27.533
But, like, if you
really want to hug them, then

38:27.533 --> 38:29.800
hug them in the way I just
showed you.

38:29.800 --> 38:32.300
- Okay.
- Hips forward...

38:32.300 --> 38:35.267
The last thing we want Kendall
to feel is that she's left out,

38:35.267 --> 38:39.333
and so, we want to throw her
this little surprise girls'

38:39.333 --> 38:41.600
night, so that we can all be
together.

38:41.600 --> 38:44.800
And we really want her to know
how valuable having sister time

38:44.800 --> 38:47.700
is, when she is in town.
We have all your favorites for

38:47.700 --> 38:49.700
- you.
- Your favorite sweet

38:49.700 --> 38:51.700
- potato fries.
- Food! Oh, yeah.

38:51.700 --> 38:53.700
- Thanks for my basket.
- Did you love it?

38:53.700 --> 38:55.600
- Did you love?
- Yeah, it was so

38:55.600 --> 38:57.300
- cute.
- Did you eat it?

38:57.300 --> 38:59.533
- I did. Sadly.
- Um, we wanted to

38:59.533 --> 39:03.600
- celebrate you being home.
- Thanks, guys.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.967
We're ne-- we never
not want to hang out with you.

39:05.967 --> 39:07.967
I just always think you're out
of town.

39:07.967 --> 39:10.200
- Yeah.
- When you're gone, Kenny,

39:10.200 --> 39:12.800
we just never want you to feel,
like, alienated, 'cause we do so

39:12.800 --> 39:15.800
many things together, like we
never want you to feel, like,

39:15.800 --> 39:18.100
left out.
'Cause I feel like Rob

39:18.100 --> 39:20.200
definitely feels left out,
so he, like...

39:20.200 --> 39:23.333
I know, but I know,
but I also know that it's like

39:23.333 --> 39:25.567
I'm the one who's away.
It's not like you guys are

39:25.567 --> 39:28.000
choosing to not do things with
me.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.300
Yeah, true.
That's so funny.

39:30.300 --> 39:33.200
You get, like, FOMO.
I would get that way when I was,

39:33.200 --> 39:36.767
- like, super pregnant.
- I love that my

39:36.767 --> 39:39.133
sisters put together a little
CARE package and that we're all

39:39.133 --> 39:41.767
gonna have kind of a girls'
night together.

39:41.767 --> 39:44.667
The second we see each other,
everything kind of falls back

39:44.667 --> 39:47.067
into place, and we're always
normal and we have fun.

39:47.067 --> 39:49.900
And I guess, in the future, I'll
just let them know that I'm in

39:49.900 --> 39:53.267
town more ahead of time, and we
can make time for each other.

39:53.267 --> 39:56.433
- Thanks, guys for doing this.
- Yeah.

39:56.433 --> 39:59.200
- Hey. Of course.
- Um...

39:59.200 --> 40:01.600
Thanks for taking
time to chill with us.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.067
- Just pamper yourself.
- Yeah.

40:04.067 --> 40:06.900
Mason, that's actually giving me

40:06.900 --> 40:09.900
chills.
It's really freaky.

40:09.900 --> 40:12.467
I don't like it.
I really actually don't like it,

40:12.467 --> 40:24.633
Mason.

40:24.633 --> 40:26.967
Kim, I'm gonna call
you Skinny K.

40:26.967 --> 40:29.300
- What you, a size two?
- Four.

40:29.300 --> 40:31.700
You'll be a two in
three weeks.

40:31.700 --> 40:34.467
- Oh, hey, you.
- You have created some

40:34.467 --> 40:36.933
drama that you need to get
yourself out of.

40:36.933 --> 40:39.733
No, I understand.

40:39.733 --> 40:43.733
- I know what I need to say.
- After I got off the

40:43.733 --> 40:47.300
phone with Rob, he called Kylie
to apologize to her personally.

40:47.300 --> 40:50.767
But I'm glad that Rob is here to
talk to my mom, like, face to

40:50.767 --> 40:53.333
face.
I think he just owes that to

40:53.333 --> 40:55.700
- her.
- Hey, Rob.

40:55.700 --> 40:58.133
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Kim.

40:58.133 --> 41:00.133
- Hey.
- What's everybody doing?

41:00.133 --> 41:02.133
- Just talking.
- Nothing, just hanging.

41:02.133 --> 41:04.133
It's like a town hall
meeting?

41:04.133 --> 41:06.533
- You look good.
- Thank you.

41:06.533 --> 41:09.767
- You look better.
Uh-huh.

41:09.767 --> 41:17.133
You... have some 'splainin'
to do.

41:17.133 --> 41:20.533
You decorated my home,
did all these nice things, put,

41:20.533 --> 41:24.867
set everything up in my home.
Do you really think that me and

41:24.867 --> 41:27.800
her are gonna go around making
fun of everything when we were

41:27.800 --> 41:30.667
literally enjoying the house,
our first night in the new home

41:30.667 --> 41:33.800
together, and we were laughing
and making funny Snapchat videos

41:33.800 --> 41:36.733
so everyone could see the house.
Why would your son go around

41:36.733 --> 41:38.733
publically making fun of his
own mother?

41:38.733 --> 41:40.733
I don't know.
That's why I was so confused.

41:40.733 --> 41:44.667
His only mother.
I'm very appreciative of

41:44.667 --> 41:47.233
everything, so I always say
that.

41:47.233 --> 41:49.667
I, I'm not that type of person--
No, I know.

41:49.667 --> 41:51.667
You're the best.
That's why I didn't know what to

41:51.667 --> 41:53.900
make of it, 'cause I was--
Well, you obviously

41:53.900 --> 41:56.000
didn't understand the humor.
But that was funny.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.667
Okay, okay.
All right, well, next time, I'll

41:58.667 --> 42:02.733
- try to keep that in mind.
- I'm really so happy that

42:02.733 --> 42:06.800
Rob came over to talk to my mom.
And I just know that that makes

42:06.800 --> 42:09.800
my mom feel so much better.
You know, I think she really

42:09.800 --> 42:13.167
deserves to hear from him.
He really hasn't been making the

42:13.167 --> 42:17.267
effort the last few years, so it
really does show that my brother

42:17.267 --> 42:20.067
cares and that he really does
feel bad about it.

42:20.067 --> 42:22.767
When Rob was a little
boy, I used to walk in the

42:22.767 --> 42:25.200
kitchen.
He would be laying on the floor

42:25.200 --> 42:28.500
and he would put ketchup all
over his body, like he was

42:28.500 --> 42:31.567
bleeding with a knife right
here, and lay there, going

42:31.567 --> 42:33.733
like this.
And I would just walk over him.

42:33.733 --> 42:36.200
- Like, totally ignore him.
- Yeah.

42:36.200 --> 42:38.200
'Cause he tried to make
me laugh.

42:38.200 --> 42:40.700
So I get that you have this
crazy sense of humor, but

42:40.700 --> 42:43.633
sometimes I just need to be
reminded.

42:46.633 --> 42:49.600
- I know.
- I love you, Rob.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.033
- You're so cute.
- I love you, too.

42:52.033 --> 42:54.467
I just really want the
best for Rob.

42:54.467 --> 42:59.267
It's every mother's dream to see
her child be really excited

42:59.267 --> 43:02.800
about life again.
I think the most important thing

43:02.800 --> 43:05.700
is that Rob is in a really
positive place and that's all

43:05.700 --> 43:08.467
that really matters.
All right, give me a hug.

43:08.467 --> 43:10.467
- I love you.
- Love you.

43:10.467 --> 43:12.100
Bye.
I'll call you.

43:12.100 --> 43:17.533
- See you later.
- See you.

43:17.533 --> 43:20.267
Keeping Up with
the Kardashians...

43:20.267 --> 43:22.267
I'm over not being
able to go out and just be,

43:22.267 --> 43:24.300
- like, normal.
- I know this guy who

43:24.300 --> 43:26.500
does prosthetics.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.567
Kim Kardashian's
favorite place--

43:28.567 --> 43:30.733
The Kardashians?
The Kar-trash-ians?

43:30.733 --> 43:33.800
- Khloe, run!
- Kourtney and Scott's

43:33.800 --> 43:36.000
relationship is a work in
progress.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.267
"I lost my family.
You guys gave up on me."

43:38.267 --> 43:40.867
How are you trying, Scott?
He's just blaming everybody else

43:40.867 --> 43:42.667
for his problems.
Scott...
