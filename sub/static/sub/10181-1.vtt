04:30.903 --> 04:33.371
All right, Eleanora.

04:34.974 --> 04:36.066
Eleanora.

04:41.180 --> 04:42.613
Miss Holiday.

04:44.817 --> 04:47.843
You better haul
your little black ass in here.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.285
Slow.

05:07.273 --> 05:08.831
It's about time.

05:10.443 --> 05:14.573
Girl, if you wants to lay around all day,
you is in the wrong end of the business.

05:14.681 --> 05:18.481
When I give it away for the first time,
it ain't gonna be to no $2 john...

05:18.584 --> 05:20.848
in East Baltimore. That's for damn sure.

05:20.953 --> 05:23.979
At the rate you going, by the time
you decide to give it away...

05:24.090 --> 05:26.820
you'll have to pay some john
$2 just to take it.

05:26.926 --> 05:29.656
I's here, y'all. I got my $2.

05:29.762 --> 05:31.286
That's dynamite.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.032
And I see just the woman I want.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.938
Come here, baby. Come to Papa.

05:41.441 --> 05:43.841
Got a surprise for you.
I got a surprise for you.

05:43.943 --> 05:46.411
I got a surprise for you, too,
if you don't leave me alone.

05:46.512 --> 05:47.638
- Come here, sweetie.
- What?

05:47.747 --> 05:49.112
Come over here.

05:49.215 --> 05:52.309
Let me tell you something. Come on.
Come on. I know. I know. Listen.

05:52.418 --> 05:53.976
I'm trying to talk to this...

05:54.087 --> 05:58.786
Now, what do a fine man like you
want with a child like this?

05:59.192 --> 06:00.955
She ain't 15 years old yet.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.925
- What that got to do with anything?
- I know.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.792
I come here to spend my money.

06:04.897 --> 06:08.230
Suppose I take you over here
and show you a real woman...

06:08.334 --> 06:10.928
who could give you your money's worth.

06:11.270 --> 06:12.259
No.

06:13.573 --> 06:16.371
No, that one's
plenty woman enough for me.

06:16.676 --> 06:19.668
Don't try to give me no jive, broad.
I see what I want.

06:19.779 --> 06:21.974
I come here to spend my money.

06:22.081 --> 06:24.413
And I see what I want, and this is it.

06:24.517 --> 06:28.009
- Come on. Come on, now.
- Well, you can't get what you see.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.316
And since you don't want
what you can get...

06:30.423 --> 06:33.620
then you know where you can go,
and this is it.

06:34.093 --> 06:36.254
We don't need his kind, no way.

06:36.362 --> 06:39.627
Imagine him making all that fuss
over one young kid.

06:40.032 --> 06:44.833
- He must have been good and drunk.
- Yeah, drunk or blind. Shit.

06:44.937 --> 06:47.599
All right, honey.
You can go now. That's enough.

06:47.707 --> 06:48.833
Honey.

06:51.043 --> 06:54.069
You are wearing this thing out
and me with it.

06:54.614 --> 06:57.640
Now, why don't you take it with you
and make it a good home?

06:57.750 --> 06:58.739
You mean, I can have it?

06:58.851 --> 07:02.252
If you can get out of here with it
before I can count to 10. One...

07:02.355 --> 07:05.847
two, three, four...

07:06.492 --> 07:10.656
five, six, seven, eight...

07:11.664 --> 07:13.655
nine, ten.

07:57.243 --> 07:59.643
Eleanora. Eleanora.

07:59.779 --> 08:02.543
The good Lord
give you two long legs to run with...

08:02.648 --> 08:04.172
and He give me two strong hands...

08:04.283 --> 08:07.184
to beat your black behind blue
the next time you slowpoke home...

08:07.286 --> 08:10.847
when you know we got an all-night drive
before we get to Cousin Charlotte's.

08:10.957 --> 08:12.686
- Sorry.
- Now, here.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.658
You take these here keys
and make sure you use them.

08:15.761 --> 08:19.162
I don't wanna come back here Sunday
night and find the house all cleaned out.

08:19.265 --> 08:22.359
Talking about cleaning,
you didn't do the steps this week...

08:22.468 --> 08:24.959
and the oven could use
a good scrubbing.

08:25.071 --> 08:28.666
I didn't have time to make the beds,
and there's washing to be put out.

08:28.774 --> 08:31.334
Wave goodbye to your cousin Eleanora.

08:33.578 --> 08:37.811
I'm gonna call Reverend Jones and
make sure you get to church on Sunday.

08:37.950 --> 08:41.215
Now, you be a good girl, Eleanora,
and next time you can come with us.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.756
There's a letter inside
from your mama from New York.

08:46.459 --> 08:49.121
And empty out the pan under the icebox.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.123
Do

10:02.034 --> 10:04.400
Want to anyway

10:08.641 --> 10:13.442
I don't care what people say

10:18.651 --> 10:21.518
If I should

10:21.621 --> 10:24.488
Take a notion

10:26.425 --> 10:30.156
To jump into the ocean

10:30.763 --> 10:34.893
Ain't nobody's business

10:35.501 --> 10:37.435
If I do

10:38.137 --> 10:40.264
If I do

10:42.174 --> 10:44.972
If my man ain't

10:45.077 --> 10:47.739
Got no money

10:48.447 --> 10:51.439
And I say take all

10:51.550 --> 10:54.917
I's here. Got my $2.

10:55.621 --> 10:58.419
It's dynamite. That's dynamite.

10:59.925 --> 11:02.120
Come on. Come on.

11:02.228 --> 11:03.525
Don't be afraid of me.

11:03.629 --> 11:05.187
I'm not gonna hurt you.

11:05.297 --> 11:07.094
I'm not scared of you,
'cause you handsome.

11:07.199 --> 11:09.429
- You know what I mean?
- Come on.

11:09.535 --> 11:12.868
- Okay, I...
- Come on. Come on.

11:12.972 --> 11:15.270
Come on, sweetie, sweetie.
Let me take a look at you.

11:15.374 --> 11:16.602
Oh, my goodness.

11:16.709 --> 11:19.610
Why don't you sit down on the...

11:19.712 --> 11:21.441
- Okay.
- Come on.

11:21.547 --> 11:25.313
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Sit down.
Can't do nothing standing up, now.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.818
Come on. Sit down. Okay.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.616
Now take your hat off,
and rest your coat.

11:42.134 --> 11:44.967
Funny girl!
And then the missus woke up...

11:45.071 --> 11:47.232
and saw
that he hadn't come home all night.

11:47.339 --> 11:49.466
And then wouldn't she hit the ceiling!

11:49.575 --> 11:51.702
Went running all over the place...

11:51.811 --> 11:54.245
flopping that old yellow nightgown
of hers, you know...

11:54.346 --> 11:57.713
and looking for him
and calling, "Charles?

11:58.117 --> 11:59.812
"Charlee?"

12:01.020 --> 12:04.114
I sure hope they get
their problems all settled...

12:04.223 --> 12:06.987
before they get back here
in the morning. Uh-oh.

12:07.426 --> 12:10.122
Got my polishing to do. See you, girl.

12:21.107 --> 12:24.076
- This your kid, Sadie?
- Yes, sir.

12:24.477 --> 12:28.675
You know she shouldn't be walking
around by herself in this neighborhood.

12:28.781 --> 12:31.079
- You know what I mean?
- Yes, sir.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.558
Guess you heard about what happened.

12:40.893 --> 12:43.987
I came all the way from Baltimore
to see you, Ma.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.030
My baby.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.699
Thank you, Mama.

12:58.911 --> 13:02.711
Sure is gonna be great
staying together again, ain't it, Ma?

13:03.415 --> 13:04.643
Ain't it, Ma?

13:08.921 --> 13:12.118
Honey, you know there ain't nothing
your mama wouldn't do for you.

13:12.224 --> 13:14.021
Nothing in the world.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.891
You can stay the night, but the madam's
coming home in the morning.

13:22.234 --> 13:23.963
I understand, Mama.

13:26.438 --> 13:27.837
Sister Edson.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.968
I bet you, if I called her and asked her...

13:31.076 --> 13:35.604
She's a lady from our church, and she's
always willing to help nice, young girls.

13:35.714 --> 13:37.978
And since you're my daughter...

13:39.251 --> 13:42.015
I bet she'd be willing
to let you do some housework...

13:42.121 --> 13:44.282
for your room and your board.

13:49.528 --> 13:52.520
- I'm sorry, baby.
- It's all right, Mama.

13:53.966 --> 13:56.730
Can't fault you for what ain't your fault.

13:56.869 --> 13:58.336
I'll be all right.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.526
Come in, missy.

14:35.207 --> 14:38.040
Excuse me, miss.
Is you "Miss Lorraine Edson...

14:38.143 --> 14:41.306
290139th Street, Harlem"?

14:42.448 --> 14:45.781
Yes, honey, I sure am.
And you must be Sadie's girl.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.113
Yes, ma'am. I am.

14:47.219 --> 14:50.450
Well, the good Lord's
delivered you safe and sound.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.423
My mama told me to say thank you
for taking me in.

14:53.525 --> 14:54.992
And she told me also to tell you...

14:55.094 --> 14:58.291
that you have
the best rooming house in Harlem...

14:58.564 --> 15:02.694
and that I ain't supposed to be lazy
and I supposed to work real, real hard.

15:02.801 --> 15:06.100
Well, now,
that's a fine spirit you got, honey.

15:07.106 --> 15:10.337
And I want you to
just make yourself right at home.

15:10.442 --> 15:11.500
Okay.

15:11.610 --> 15:14.943
Rest your things. Look around.
I'll be right back.

15:16.048 --> 15:18.710
That's a fine young girl.

16:04.930 --> 16:08.331
Well, now, honey, I'll show you
my whole place, upstairs and down.

16:08.434 --> 16:10.334
I don't want to see the upstairs,
Miss Edson...

16:10.436 --> 16:13.303
'cause my Mama told me
you had a job for me as a cleaner.

16:13.405 --> 16:15.305
And that's what I got, missy.

16:15.407 --> 16:18.638
I mean, you're the one
with other things on your mind.

16:18.744 --> 16:22.441
Wishful thinking, I call it.
'Cause, girl, let's face it...

16:23.182 --> 16:24.615
you got a long way to go...

16:24.717 --> 16:27.880
before you can earn $2
for just 10 minutes of your time...

16:28.287 --> 16:30.949
or ain't you looked at yourself lately?

16:56.181 --> 16:59.344
That lazy bitch.
She don't look where she's going.

17:00.019 --> 17:04.148
Ain't it a shame how some
of God's children have it so easy...

17:04.790 --> 17:07.724
and others have it so hard?

17:08.327 --> 17:09.919
"Ain't it a shame?"

17:29.815 --> 17:34.081
Last night, night before
Two different robbers at my door

18:38.050 --> 18:39.251
Come on.

18:39.418 --> 18:40.510
Kid, come on, beat it.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.747
- Mister, is the boss around?
- You're saying goodbye to him. Bye-bye.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.881
Okay, but look,
I work in the neighborhood already...

18:45.991 --> 18:48.824
and I'd be willing to quit working
and come up here and work for you.

18:48.927 --> 18:51.122
Yeah, I'd be very happy to quit, too.
Come on, honey.

18:51.230 --> 18:52.697
- But I can sing. I really can.
- Yeah.

18:52.798 --> 18:56.256
I can dance, and I know the words
to every song that's out today.

18:56.368 --> 18:58.302
I mean, I've been really rehearsing
and everything.

18:58.403 --> 19:00.268
That's very good. So do I.
But I tell you...

19:00.372 --> 19:03.569
in order to be a showgirl,
you gotta have something to show.

19:03.675 --> 19:05.142
Well, I got something. I really do.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.838
All you have to do is push it up a bit
and put some lip rouge on.

19:07.946 --> 19:10.380
I could do it, mister, give me a break.
Look, really, I'm good.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.780
- All you have to do is give me a chance.
- Listen, girlie.

19:12.885 --> 19:16.184
Listen to me. I don't wanna hurt
your feelings, but no amount of slinky...

19:16.288 --> 19:20.019
and makeup is gonna change you
into a female that looks...

19:22.895 --> 19:24.192
like that.

19:24.463 --> 19:26.454
Louis, so good to see you.

19:26.565 --> 19:29.932
I'll get you a great table. How about
a nice table for Mr. McKay?

20:31.363 --> 20:34.992
What you looking at?
Don't your mama make you wash steps?

21:12.904 --> 21:15.498
Shake it to the east
Shake it to the west

21:15.607 --> 21:18.269
Shake it to the one
that you love the best

21:21.146 --> 21:23.910
- Now?
- No, not yet, don't you peek, Mama.

21:27.152 --> 21:28.915
- Now?
- Not yet.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.789
- Now?
- No.

21:35.894 --> 21:37.521
Now come with me.

21:43.935 --> 21:45.334
Surprise.

21:48.006 --> 21:50.804
Jesus. Lord have mercy.

21:50.909 --> 21:54.174
I ain't never,
in my whole life, seen such a fine hat.

21:54.579 --> 21:57.571
Just like them fancy ladies
up on Sugar Hill.

21:59.618 --> 22:02.610
Oh, Lord, and just to think
my baby give it to me.

22:04.623 --> 22:06.488
Honey, I just loves it.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.392
God bless Sister Edson.

22:09.928 --> 22:13.864
I can see she's doing right by you.
Every time you come over here...

22:13.999 --> 22:18.129
you're looking better and better. Still
cleaning and washing, no cooking yet?

22:18.236 --> 22:20.033
No, not yet.

22:20.372 --> 22:23.864
Hey, Mama, I gotta go. It's getting late.
I don't wanna miss my train.

22:23.975 --> 22:27.672
Honey, I forgot.
I got a surprise for you, too.

22:28.246 --> 22:32.478
I got me a new job starting next week,
and it's gonna be close by you...

22:32.584 --> 22:35.519
and I'll be able to walk over
most evenings, won't that be nice?

22:35.620 --> 22:37.144
And we can visit.

22:37.255 --> 22:39.883
That'll be swell, Mama.
That'll be just swell.

22:39.991 --> 22:42.459
- Just what we always wanted.
- Yeah.

22:42.561 --> 22:45.758
We'll be able to
spend more time together.

22:46.131 --> 22:47.996
That'll be real great.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.895
Lord have mercy. My baby done
made me so happy this day.

23:12.124 --> 23:15.685
Eleanora, you're late again. Girl,
you done missed two tricks already.

23:15.794 --> 23:19.127
You better get the spirit, sister,
and get yourself on up them steps...

23:19.231 --> 23:21.028
and quit your lollygagging.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.727
Didn't you mama teach you
how to close doors?

23:23.835 --> 23:26.827
If you don't want this job,
somebody else sure do.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.919
You fine, young thing.

24:23.562 --> 24:25.826
You're new in the neighborhood.

24:25.931 --> 24:28.923
So, honey, I gotta love you real good.

24:30.368 --> 24:33.735
Looky here
what Lorraine done sent to me.

24:34.339 --> 24:36.899
I never accomplished any great feats...

24:37.008 --> 24:38.999
but you know something, baby?

24:39.110 --> 24:41.704
I'm something else under them sheets.

24:41.813 --> 24:45.249
You see my father was a jockey,
and he taught me how to ride.

24:45.350 --> 24:49.844
He said, Big Ben, you got to get it
from side to side.

24:50.655 --> 24:53.249
Now, in case you don't know who I am...

24:53.992 --> 24:58.190
I'm Big Ben, baby. Yeah, the lover-man.

24:59.197 --> 25:02.223
We gonna have ourselves a ball tonight.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.996
Lorraine done sent me this fine dinner.

25:07.038 --> 25:10.804
Young and tender.
This is where her head was.

25:11.476 --> 25:13.910
Won't be there when I get through.

25:14.279 --> 25:18.511
'Cause, see, I'm from the city,
and I'm gonna kiss your little titty.

25:20.252 --> 25:23.016
Young, and fine, and mellow.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.490
Light as a feather.

25:26.591 --> 25:29.185
Big Ben told all his men
Don't you take no numbers

25:29.294 --> 25:31.262
After half past ten

25:31.363 --> 25:33.888
What? What's the matter
with you, woman?

25:34.633 --> 25:38.399
Ain't nothing personal, mister,
but I just quit the business.

25:38.803 --> 25:42.534
Hell, bitch, you crazy?
Ain't this a killer?

25:42.641 --> 25:43.733
Lorraine.

25:43.842 --> 25:45.673
Hey, Lorraine. Lorraine.

25:45.777 --> 25:48.177
What's happening?
Who's making all that noise up there?

25:48.280 --> 25:50.339
- He said his name is Big Ben.
- Big Ben?

25:50.448 --> 25:52.575
Ain't you supposed to be upstairs
with Big Ben?

25:52.684 --> 25:55.346
- I ain't doing it.
- What you mean you ain't doing it, girl?

25:55.453 --> 25:58.547
You give my place a bad name.
Big Ben's the best customer I got.

25:58.657 --> 26:01.251
You can't do that.
All the girls love Big Ben.

26:01.359 --> 26:04.351
He's my best customer, and I'm trying
to make something out of you.

26:04.462 --> 26:07.158
I sent him up to you.
Now, what's the matter with you, girl?

26:07.265 --> 26:10.723
You better get the spirit, sister, and
get on back upstairs and do your work.

26:10.835 --> 26:14.236
- The Lord knows I'm trying to help you...
- Miss Edson, honey, I done quit.

26:14.339 --> 26:15.636
Done quit?

26:16.107 --> 26:18.940
Well, you get on away from around
here, then. 'Cause you ain't nothing.

26:19.044 --> 26:21.842
You ain't never been nothing,
and you ain't gonna be nothing.

26:21.947 --> 26:25.007
'Cause you don't go messing like that
with Big Ben.

26:25.150 --> 26:28.608
- That's right.
- Get your ass back in the house.

27:09.694 --> 27:12.185
- You looking for someone, Miss?
- Yes.

27:13.264 --> 27:14.458
I noticed your sign in the window...

27:14.566 --> 27:16.932
and I'm a featured dancer
at a club downtown.

27:17.035 --> 27:21.904
And I don't have much time,
but I happen to live in the neighborhood.

27:22.007 --> 27:24.999
And I'm looking
for something a little closer to home.

27:26.511 --> 27:28.376
So you're a dancer now?

27:29.848 --> 27:32.544
Okay, dancer. Dance.

28:23.401 --> 28:25.869
Yeah, that's fine, girls. Take 10.

28:26.404 --> 28:29.669
Thank you, honey. Just real nice.
Beautiful. Wonderful.

28:29.774 --> 28:31.833
I tell you what,
watch your step as you leave.

28:31.943 --> 28:33.877
You know the way out. Be careful.

28:33.978 --> 28:35.570
Hey, baby, you know how to sing?

28:35.680 --> 28:37.841
Yeah, I know how to sing,
but he wants a dancer.

28:37.949 --> 28:41.043
You ain't got nothing to lose.
You better try to think up a song.

28:41.152 --> 28:43.882
- I can sing anything. Shoot.
- All right, let's try something.

28:43.988 --> 28:45.615
- What you know?
- But he doesn't like me.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.352
He ain't got nothing to do. I can
handle him. What can you sing?

28:48.460 --> 28:51.190
- I can sing All of Me.
- Jerry, I'm sorry, brother. Just go on.

28:51.296 --> 28:53.628
All of Me, man,
you ain't never heard this like this.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.131
- All Of Me.
- Church, take you home.

28:55.233 --> 28:56.894
This a friend of mine, man, I didn't...

28:57.001 --> 28:59.697
You gonna love it. Jerry,
you're a good person in your heart.

28:59.804 --> 29:03.399
- You know you're gonna love it.
- Okay, okay, let her sing. Sing.

29:04.843 --> 29:06.538
All of me

29:07.178 --> 29:09.305
Ain't Miss Holiday something?

29:18.423 --> 29:19.981
All of me

29:21.326 --> 29:24.989
Why not take all of me

29:27.398 --> 29:29.832
Can't you see

29:30.034 --> 29:33.401
I'm no good without you

29:35.106 --> 29:37.165
Take my lips

29:37.308 --> 29:41.210
I want to lose them

29:42.046 --> 29:44.014
Take my arms

29:44.215 --> 29:46.843
I'll never use them

29:48.520 --> 29:50.454
Your goodbye

29:50.555 --> 29:53.820
Left me with eyes that cry

29:55.126 --> 29:59.995
How can I
Go on without you

30:01.633 --> 30:04.295
You took the part

30:04.402 --> 30:07.633
That once was my heart

30:07.739 --> 30:12.073
So why not
Take all of me

30:13.678 --> 30:14.906
Yeah

30:15.013 --> 30:18.176
Take all of me

30:24.122 --> 30:26.420
Come on, you girls, come on,
you gotta get dressed.

30:26.524 --> 30:29.118
We open in 15 minutes. And you...

30:29.594 --> 30:31.391
Tonight, you get your chance.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.760
Wait a minute.
What'd you say your name was?

30:33.865 --> 30:35.924
- Eleanora.
- Ella... Ella who?

30:38.436 --> 30:41.667
Billie. Billie Holiday.
Billie Holiday, that's my name.

30:41.773 --> 30:44.765
Okay, Billie. One of the girls
will show you where you put your things.

30:44.876 --> 30:47.970
Tonight, all you gotta do is watch
the other singers and do what they do.

30:48.079 --> 30:49.341
Okay, you're an angel, Jerry.

30:49.447 --> 30:53.645
Yeah, wait a minute. I'll be a bum
if you don't pull in $15 in tips tonight.

30:53.751 --> 30:56.686
$15. Now, that's my definition
of a good singer.

30:56.788 --> 30:57.880
Okay.

30:58.423 --> 31:00.254
Go on, Billie Holiday.

31:51.042 --> 31:53.010
What you frowning about, baby?

31:53.111 --> 31:55.375
Don't worry about it.
What she miss on the top...

31:55.480 --> 31:57.380
she can pick up on the bottom.

31:57.482 --> 31:59.746
I hope that works both ways.

31:59.851 --> 32:03.287
Don't worry about it.
One day, she picked the table up.

32:10.828 --> 32:12.762
All right, Mama, go ahead.

32:12.864 --> 32:16.561
Next time, you could pick up the floor.
We don't need a janitor.

32:17.235 --> 32:20.033
Go on. Go on. Jerry's watching.
Right there, Jack.

32:20.605 --> 32:21.833
Come on, baby.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.431
That's a new girl just breaking in.

32:38.723 --> 32:41.419
Some day he'll come along

32:41.559 --> 32:42.651
Yes, sir.

32:42.927 --> 32:45.122
The man I love

32:46.097 --> 32:48.531
And he'll be big and strong

32:48.633 --> 32:49.600
Pick it up.

32:49.701 --> 32:51.498
The man I love

32:51.602 --> 32:53.035
Pick it up. Come over. Come on.

32:53.137 --> 32:55.901
And when he comes my way

32:57.308 --> 33:02.007
I'll do my best to make him stay

33:02.780 --> 33:04.407
You're pitiful.

33:05.950 --> 33:08.976
He'll look at me and smile

33:10.421 --> 33:12.651
I'll understand

33:12.991 --> 33:15.687
Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up.

33:15.793 --> 33:20.230
Then in a little while
He'll take my hand

33:20.465 --> 33:23.127
And though it seems absurd

33:23.234 --> 33:25.327
- Come on. Come on.
- Pick it up.

33:26.270 --> 33:28.602
You think you're too good
to pick up money?

33:28.706 --> 33:32.198
- Want me to put my foot in your ass?
- Would you shut up?

33:32.977 --> 33:37.346
Maybe he'll come Sunday

33:38.950 --> 33:41.544
Maybe Monday

33:41.652 --> 33:43.552
You gotta do better than that, hon.

33:43.654 --> 33:44.951
Maybe not

33:45.590 --> 33:47.421
Go. Get it. Get it.

33:47.592 --> 33:51.756
Still I'm sure he'll come one day

33:52.397 --> 33:56.060
Maybe Tuesday

33:56.200 --> 34:00.694
Will be my good news day

34:01.339 --> 34:04.467
He'll build a little home

34:05.376 --> 34:08.004
Just meant for two

34:08.112 --> 34:10.978
From which I'll never roam

34:11.081 --> 34:13.915
Take the money. Come on,
I can do better than that myself.

34:14.585 --> 34:17.382
And so all else above

34:17.621 --> 34:18.748
Go ahead, pick it on up.

34:18.856 --> 34:21.518
I'm dreaming of

34:22.860 --> 34:25.987
The man I love

34:38.242 --> 34:40.710
Schmuck. Me and my big heart,
and you and your friends.

34:40.812 --> 34:44.110
- Who does she think she is?
- A lady. With a hell of a voice.

34:44.215 --> 34:46.445
We ain't gonna end up
with a quarter tonight.

34:46.551 --> 34:48.178
Shit, you ain't paid me in two weeks...

34:48.286 --> 34:50.254
what you bullshitting about a quarter?

34:58.429 --> 35:01.193
Billie, Billie, go get it. Get the money.

35:01.399 --> 35:03.799
Go on. Get it.

35:14.145 --> 35:16.409
Do you want my arm to fall off?

35:30.128 --> 35:33.063
Take it. Take the money. Take it, Billie.

35:47.645 --> 35:50.705
I fell in love with you
The first time I looked into

35:50.815 --> 35:53.215
Them there eyes

35:53.885 --> 35:56.718
'Cause you have a certain little
Cute way of flirting

35:56.821 --> 35:58.755
With them there eyes

36:00.491 --> 36:04.552
They make me feel so happy
They make me feel so blue

36:04.662 --> 36:05.754
Take it.

36:06.564 --> 36:08.589
I'm falling
No stalling

36:08.699 --> 36:10.599
- Here's some money.
- Work it out, baby.

36:11.669 --> 36:14.638
My heart is jumping
You've started something

36:14.739 --> 36:17.105
With them there eyes

36:18.843 --> 36:23.246
You'd better look out, little brown eyes
If you're wise

36:23.347 --> 36:25.281
Sing like a lady. Come on, lady.

36:25.383 --> 36:26.645
They bubble

36:26.751 --> 36:29.686
Gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble

36:29.787 --> 36:32.017
Ooh, baby

36:32.790 --> 36:37.557
Them there eyes

36:40.331 --> 36:41.889
Them there eyes

36:46.070 --> 36:46.170
Here's your cut, Billie.
I like you. I think you're gonna make it.

36:46.170 --> 36:48.934
Here's your cut, Billie.
I like you. I think you're gonna make it.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.304
Thanks, Jerry. I like you, too.

36:54.278 --> 36:55.802
Say, baby, that's beautiful.

36:55.913 --> 36:56.971
Here, take some.

36:57.081 --> 36:59.311
Get out. Come on,
you were beautiful tonight.

36:59.417 --> 37:01.248
I just wanna tell you thank you.

37:01.352 --> 37:03.149
I love you.
You were beautiful. Just pretty.

37:03.254 --> 37:05.484
Thank you.
I really was scared, I'll tell you that.

37:05.590 --> 37:08.081
You should have been scared.
Them niggers is dangerous.

37:08.192 --> 37:10.160
- Billie.
- What you doing?

37:10.595 --> 37:12.028
- Billie.
- Yeah? Yeah, Jerry.

37:12.129 --> 37:15.565
These are for you.
There's a car waiting for you upstairs.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.861
- Thanks, Jerry.
- Here's your money, Yvonne.

37:17.969 --> 37:20.164
A car waiting for me upstairs.

37:22.273 --> 37:25.800
Don't flash them moon eyes at me.
I didn't send you nothing.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.400
There was never a doubt in my mind.

37:27.511 --> 37:30.139
Besides, there's a card,
and you probably can't even write.

37:30.248 --> 37:33.684
Don't have to know how to read, neither,
to know what that card's saying.

37:33.784 --> 37:36.082
If he spent as much time
running his numbers...

37:36.187 --> 37:39.315
as he does them damn gardenias,
he could have one hell of a business.

37:41.359 --> 37:44.260
Think you're pretty smart, don't you?
Well, what do you know?

37:44.362 --> 37:45.727
You got a great thing going in here.

37:45.830 --> 37:48.799
Leave that nigger alone.
He is dangerous. You understand?

37:48.966 --> 37:52.299
He pulls that bit on everybody,
got a room full of girls at home.

37:52.403 --> 37:56.533
You just gonna be another one. You
wanna be that? You got too much going.

37:56.641 --> 37:58.802
This is one face
that won't get that hungry.

37:58.909 --> 38:01.207
I don't stand in no line for nobody.

38:01.312 --> 38:02.370
All right.

38:02.480 --> 38:05.244
Not even Mr. Louis McKay.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.677
Jerry?

38:11.255 --> 38:13.951
- Tell him the answer is no.
- No?

38:14.058 --> 38:15.082
No.

38:18.462 --> 38:22.990
That'll show him, 'cause he usually gets
everyone he wants.

38:23.634 --> 38:27.001
He can get this one, too,
but not on the first night.

38:30.107 --> 38:31.574
Good night, lady.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.805
- Good night, Billie.
- Good night, Jerry.

38:37.348 --> 38:40.249
What's the matter?
You don't like gardenias?

38:41.319 --> 38:42.752
They're okay.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.144
So?

38:45.556 --> 38:48.957
So you don't put them on
just to go to someone's apartment...

38:49.060 --> 38:50.994
for a late-night supper.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.493
- So that's how it is?
- That's how it is.

38:56.701 --> 38:59.602
Pardon me, lady, I must have
got you mixed up with someone...

38:59.704 --> 39:03.868
who used to reside at Missus...
What's her name?

39:04.408 --> 39:07.900
If that's what you thought, nigger,
why'd you give me them damn flowers?

39:08.012 --> 39:09.946
Why didn't you
just give me some money?

39:14.785 --> 39:15.911
I did.

39:21.225 --> 39:24.956
Hey, Billie. Listen, listen, all right?

39:25.062 --> 39:27.223
You don't mind
if I call you Billie, do you?

39:27.331 --> 39:28.923
- Don't call me nothing.
- No, listen.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.524
Listen, I know a place downtown.
It's open all night.

39:31.635 --> 39:34.729
A fantastic place. You can eat.
You can have food. You can dance.

39:34.839 --> 39:36.602
You can do anything you want.
Now, come on.

39:36.707 --> 39:38.299
Just like the late-night-supper stuff?

39:38.409 --> 39:41.207
No, no, this is for real, baby.
Listen, there's my car right there.

39:41.312 --> 39:44.873
We can go on right down there
right now. Listen, I like you.

39:44.982 --> 39:46.609
I wouldn't do anything to harm you.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.208
- I'm so thrilled.
- Really, seriously.

39:52.857 --> 39:54.347
Please, Billie.

39:56.026 --> 39:58.722
- Please? Pretty please?
- Pretty please.

39:59.063 --> 40:00.325
All right?

40:01.365 --> 40:04.528
Come on. You look so pretty.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.373
What's been going on?

40:16.113 --> 40:17.546
Good evening.

40:18.182 --> 40:19.911
Mr. McKay, it's nice to see you again.

40:20.017 --> 40:21.382
Paul, come stai?

40:21.485 --> 40:23.419
- Bene. Bene. How are you?
- Good.

40:23.521 --> 40:26.046
Gosh, you stayed away a long time.

41:21.712 --> 41:25.580
A sound

41:25.749 --> 41:29.845
UntiI that day
You came my way

41:29.987 --> 41:33.582
With pleasure I never found

41:33.691 --> 41:35.181
It all might have been

41:35.292 --> 41:38.625
Had you been around

41:44.168 --> 41:46.432
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

41:46.537 --> 41:50.303
Fantastic. Fantastic. Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen. Thank you, Janie.

41:50.407 --> 41:53.467
She gets better-Iooking every day,
doesn't she, guys?

41:53.577 --> 41:56.444
Well, how do you like this place?
Isn't this something?

41:56.547 --> 42:00.176
I wanted to bring you here because
I thought you'd really enjoy yourself.

42:00.284 --> 42:04.277
It ain't so hot. I been
to a whole lot of places like this before.

42:07.491 --> 42:10.324
Is that so? Right. Well, where?

42:14.765 --> 42:15.732
Huh?

42:18.669 --> 42:21.171
- Where?
- Where what?

42:21.305 --> 42:24.832
You said you've been
to a lot of places like this before.

42:25.809 --> 42:27.674
- Where?
- Did I say that?

42:28.145 --> 42:31.740
I heard you say that.
Maybe I misunderstood what you said.

42:32.116 --> 42:34.209
What do you think you said?

42:35.653 --> 42:37.587
I said, you ain't so hot.

42:39.657 --> 42:40.624
Well...

42:43.060 --> 42:44.118
I...

42:44.228 --> 42:46.856
I just love the way you talk,
you know what I mean?

42:46.964 --> 42:48.488
Well, you make me...

42:48.599 --> 42:52.228
You know... I've never met
nobody like you before, you know?

42:52.336 --> 42:54.201
You kind of make me speechless.

42:54.305 --> 42:56.330
- Do, I really? I mean, really?
- I mean, yeah.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.408
Right. I don't know
what to do with myself, you see.

42:58.509 --> 43:02.206
I don't even know what to do with
my hands and everything, you know?

43:02.313 --> 43:05.111
You sure have pretty teeth
when you smile.

43:06.750 --> 43:07.808
Okay.

43:08.519 --> 43:11.147
And that, you know...

43:13.490 --> 43:16.891
That dress.
I want to tell you about that dress.

43:18.195 --> 43:21.392
That dress brings out
the best tones in your skin.

43:26.370 --> 43:28.031
Do you feel like dancing?

43:31.408 --> 43:32.739
I don't know.

43:33.410 --> 43:35.139
Well, I feel like dancing.

43:36.347 --> 43:39.316
Go on and dance, then.
Ain't nobody stopping you.

43:40.417 --> 43:43.147
You mean,
you want me to dance by myself?

43:45.356 --> 43:46.414
Okay.

43:46.790 --> 43:49.691
Thank you. I really appreciate that.

43:49.793 --> 43:53.388
Yeah, you really a nice lady, you know?
Come on, now.

44:05.376 --> 44:07.071
Mr. McKay...

44:07.711 --> 44:09.804
I have a confession to make.

44:10.714 --> 44:12.079
What's that?

44:12.583 --> 44:14.517
This place is fantastic...

44:15.519 --> 44:17.077
and so are you.

44:18.088 --> 44:19.055
Yeah.

44:28.866 --> 44:31.391
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

44:31.735 --> 44:33.726
Can't you do it sleeping?

44:36.206 --> 44:38.640
I really can't believe
I'm here with you, you know that?

44:38.742 --> 44:41.404
If you don't go to sleep, you won't be.

44:42.880 --> 44:45.815
That's what I get
for breaking a house rule.

44:46.350 --> 44:49.717
I like to have breakfast alone,
you know what I mean?

45:11.608 --> 45:13.667
What are you doing, woman?

45:18.749 --> 45:21.013
You want me to leave, don't you?

45:23.821 --> 45:26.551
Look, when I want you to leave,
I'll let you know, okay?

45:26.657 --> 45:27.624
Okay.

45:28.325 --> 45:29.383
Okay.

45:37.334 --> 45:40.497
Just so you don't get any big idea,
you understand?

45:43.540 --> 45:46.168
- We'll take this a day at a time.
- Okay.

45:46.276 --> 45:48.005
All right.

45:48.112 --> 45:49.739
Anything you say.

45:55.285 --> 45:56.479
Louis?

46:00.424 --> 46:01.652
Now what?

46:06.063 --> 46:08.088
How do you like your eggs?

46:48.005 --> 46:50.030
I want a pig foot

46:50.974 --> 46:54.102
And a bottle of beer

47:08.759 --> 47:10.750
Is she great? Is she beautiful?

47:10.861 --> 47:13.955
Okay. Okay, folks,
we got a little celebration.

47:14.331 --> 47:15.696
Our lady...

47:16.733 --> 47:18.963
herself, Miss Billie...

47:19.069 --> 47:21.833
appearing in this nightclub for one year.

47:24.274 --> 47:28.608
And in honor of the occasion...
Bring that in, and be careful with it.

47:29.813 --> 47:31.075
Everybody gets a piece.

47:31.181 --> 47:33.615
I mean a hunk. A hunk of the cake.

47:34.318 --> 47:36.149
Courtesy of the house. Yeah.

47:37.020 --> 47:40.319
And everybody's gonna get
a glass of champagne...

47:40.424 --> 47:43.120
courtesy of Mr. McKay over there.

47:47.531 --> 47:49.465
Okay. Hey, Mr. Piano Man.

47:49.566 --> 47:51.727
Come here.
You're the guy who discovered her.

47:51.835 --> 47:53.427
How about you propose the toast?

47:53.537 --> 47:55.471
Hey, I'm for that. Hey, Billie.

47:55.572 --> 47:58.302
We got Old Cheapie
to spring for something.

47:58.809 --> 48:01.175
You're beautiful, Jer. Damn, Jer!

48:02.512 --> 48:04.241
Damn, but everything's beautiful.

48:04.348 --> 48:06.612
He even paid the band, Billie,
since you been here.

48:06.717 --> 48:09.686
Beautiful year. And everybody... Girls.
Look at the uniforms!

48:09.786 --> 48:12.653
All right.
Look, even the hoes is making money.

48:13.957 --> 48:16.949
That's only because
you're our biggest trick.

48:20.430 --> 48:23.627
Anyway, Billie, we love you sincerely,
very much, in our hearts.

48:23.734 --> 48:25.065
We sure do.

48:27.938 --> 48:29.769
- You gonna play, Piano Man?
- Yeah.

48:29.873 --> 48:31.340
Key a bar. Okay.

48:31.909 --> 48:32.967
Break it.

48:33.076 --> 48:35.237
For she's a jolly good lady

48:35.345 --> 48:37.575
For she's a jolly good lady

48:37.681 --> 48:41.117
For she's a jolly good lady

48:41.952 --> 48:45.319
Which nobody can deny

48:50.928 --> 48:53.158
Hey, Billie, I want you to meet
two friends of mine.

48:53.263 --> 48:55.322
- This is Harry and Reg. Come on in.
- Yeah.

48:55.432 --> 48:57.525
Come on in. There she is.

48:58.602 --> 48:59.728
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi.

48:59.836 --> 49:01.770
- Hi, Reg. How are you?
- Really nice to meet you.

49:01.872 --> 49:05.308
I hate to interrupt you. I know you're all
celebrating and everything...

49:05.409 --> 49:09.004
but I just sure appreciate meeting you.

49:10.580 --> 49:12.775
My name is Harry Bradford.
That is, if you didn't get it.

49:12.883 --> 49:15.613
- Over there, this is Reg Hanley.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

49:15.786 --> 49:17.549
- Louis McKay.
- We...

49:17.654 --> 49:20.316
We're just fans of yours.

49:20.424 --> 49:22.255
And I need all the fans I can get.

49:22.359 --> 49:24.486
Pull up a couple of chairs, fellows,
and join us.

49:24.594 --> 49:25.720
Thank you.

49:29.266 --> 49:30.631
Where do you fellows play?

49:30.734 --> 49:33.567
Well, actually,
we're playing no place right now.

49:33.670 --> 49:37.128
Fact is, we're trying to form a band
to take a tour around the country...

49:37.240 --> 49:39.765
and we wanted to talk to you
about joining us.

49:39.876 --> 49:41.366
Joining you? You serious?

49:41.478 --> 49:42.672
Very.

49:45.148 --> 49:47.480
A colored singer with a white band?

49:47.584 --> 49:49.745
Yeah. Yeah.

49:50.053 --> 49:51.145
Yeah?

49:53.457 --> 49:55.186
You must want to keep playing no place.

49:55.292 --> 49:57.260
Well, you see, that's exactly the point.

49:57.361 --> 50:00.353
We wouldn't be just another band
with you singing.

50:00.464 --> 50:03.763
We'd be something special
because, well, you're special, Billie.

50:03.867 --> 50:05.334
Here.

50:06.370 --> 50:07.394
There you go.

50:09.306 --> 50:10.364
Thank you.

50:10.474 --> 50:12.374
We'd go straight to the top. I know.

50:12.476 --> 50:14.341
I don't know about no straight to the top.

50:14.444 --> 50:16.105
I'm just trying to get to a club downtown.

50:16.213 --> 50:17.237
We all are.

50:17.347 --> 50:20.441
Of course, you don't understand, see,
the way you get downtown is...

50:20.550 --> 50:23.542
I mean, you know, the way you do that
is that you go out on the road...

50:23.653 --> 50:26.087
and you build up your name
in the sticks, and then, blam!

50:26.189 --> 50:29.317
You get snapped up by network radio,
who're always looking...

50:29.426 --> 50:33.863
for someone big with the hicks
to sell them soap or something.

50:33.964 --> 50:35.625
Yeah, then you come back
to New York...

50:35.732 --> 50:38.257
and besides radio,
there's records, club dates downtown...

50:38.368 --> 50:41.201
- you name it, Billie.
- Just like that, huh?

50:41.304 --> 50:43.568
Well, it works that way sometimes.

50:43.673 --> 50:47.370
You mean to tell me that I have to travel
all the way to East Jesus and back...

50:47.477 --> 50:51.504
before I can get in some club downtown
less than five minutes away from here?

50:51.615 --> 50:53.640
- Well...
- They full of shit, ain't they?

50:57.954 --> 51:02.584
I just think it'd be fantastic
if you just came with us.

51:03.927 --> 51:06.361
- How about that?
- I'm sorry, fellows.

51:06.463 --> 51:09.066
I think your band
is gonna have to start without me.

51:09.366 --> 51:11.994
I'll tell you what.
Piano Man's got my telephone number.

51:12.102 --> 51:15.367
If you give it some second thoughts,
give us a call.

51:18.708 --> 51:20.539
How you like my timestep, Reg?

51:20.644 --> 51:22.635
I think we might have a part for you,
Miss Holiday...

51:22.746 --> 51:24.373
but we'll have to see your legs.

51:29.419 --> 51:32.718
You know the last time
I saw fields and farm animals...

51:32.823 --> 51:35.656
I was hitching up north from Baltimore
to see my mama.

51:35.759 --> 51:39.490
Leader, I am trying to follow a rule
called "food three times a day"...

51:39.596 --> 51:40.995
but I sense we are dangerously behind.

51:41.098 --> 51:42.588
Let me explain to you.

51:42.699 --> 51:45.793
This is only Tuesday,
and I only feed on Friday.

51:46.236 --> 51:48.067
Stop complaining, Oklahoma.

51:48.171 --> 51:49.297
That's a horrible-Iooking thing.

51:49.406 --> 51:52.603
You mean we have all this fun,
and we still get paid?

51:52.709 --> 51:55.473
Well, about $12 a week,
to do with what you will.

51:56.113 --> 51:57.740
$14? Would you take $8?

51:57.848 --> 51:59.509
Fantastic. I'll take
whatever you give me.

51:59.616 --> 52:02.016
I get the chance to travel.
I get a chance to do everything.

52:02.119 --> 52:05.020
I sense we're in for a lot
of candy stores and a lot of jelly beans.

52:05.122 --> 52:07.420
Can you imagine
someone liking to tour?

52:07.524 --> 52:09.355
Yes, some fun, Billie.

52:10.093 --> 52:10.927
Miss Holiday...

52:10.927 --> 52:11.518
Miss Holiday...

52:11.628 --> 52:13.391
you're in the South now.

52:17.400 --> 52:18.765
Jesus, look at this.

52:18.869 --> 52:22.168
You got a half an hour, that's all.
Billie, let me help you out of there.

52:22.272 --> 52:24.001
- A whole half-hour?
- Let me help you out.

52:24.107 --> 52:25.631
Half an hour's all we got.

52:26.643 --> 52:29.441
- Put your shoes on, man.
- Get on out here.

52:29.779 --> 52:32.907
Billie, what'll it be? What do you want?

52:33.016 --> 52:35.610
What do I want? What do I really want?

52:35.719 --> 52:37.118
What do you really want?

52:37.220 --> 52:38.551
Well, I'll tell you.

52:38.788 --> 52:40.619
- What?
- I really want...

52:41.424 --> 52:43.517
a steak smothered in onions.

52:45.128 --> 52:48.097
And I really want
a big pot of collard greens.

52:48.198 --> 52:49.222
Right.

52:49.332 --> 52:51.027
- And I want some yams.
- Right.

52:51.134 --> 52:53.329
- I want some black-eyed peas and rice.
- Right.

52:53.436 --> 52:55.563
And I want...

52:57.974 --> 52:59.202
potato pie.

52:59.309 --> 53:01.140
One hot dog, coming up.

53:01.378 --> 53:02.902
- Mustard?
- Oh, crap.

53:06.183 --> 53:09.118
- Hey, Reg...
- Hello, I'm from the Board of Health.

53:12.722 --> 53:15.122
Billie, you ain't missing a thing.

53:22.866 --> 53:27.030
I cried for you

53:29.039 --> 53:32.566
What a fool I used to be

53:34.110 --> 53:37.307
Now I found two eyes

53:37.414 --> 53:40.577
Just a little bit bluer

53:40.684 --> 53:42.914
I found a heart

53:43.019 --> 53:46.011
Just a little bit truer

53:46.223 --> 53:50.057
And I cried for you

53:52.128 --> 53:56.394
Now it's your turn
To cry over me

54:03.473 --> 54:05.168
Still think it's fun, Billie?

54:08.011 --> 54:09.672
Watch it, will you?

54:09.779 --> 54:11.644
Sorry to say it's that time again.

54:11.748 --> 54:15.343
This has been the Oasis Cosmetics
Hour from New York, New York...

54:15.452 --> 54:18.250
featuring the new mellow sounds
of our Sweet Sam...

54:18.355 --> 54:19.913
and His Society Swingers.

54:20.023 --> 54:22.082
- So untiI tomorrow night...
- Man, did you hear that?

54:22.192 --> 54:23.853
- Here we go again.
- Did you hear that?

54:23.960 --> 54:26.485
- Yeah.
- Sweet Sam and His Society Sissies.

54:26.596 --> 54:29.156
That's supposed to be us, man.
That should be our gig.

54:29.266 --> 54:30.597
Do you want to be a sissy?

54:30.700 --> 54:34.227
Man, here we are, riding our asses off
all over this cotton-picking country...

54:34.337 --> 54:37.500
trying to win these hicks over,
and what do we got to show for it?

54:37.607 --> 54:40.075
Zero. Nothing, man. Bullshit.

54:40.176 --> 54:43.805
Where is that big radio cat
that's supposed to discover us, Reg?

54:43.913 --> 54:45.608
Where is that son of a bitch, anyway?

54:45.715 --> 54:48.343
Watch your mouth.
Can't you see there's a lady present?

54:48.451 --> 54:51.318
That's right.
Show some respect, you motherfucker.

54:51.421 --> 54:52.649
Billie.

54:57.460 --> 54:58.757
Who is it?

55:00.196 --> 55:01.322
It's Harry.

55:01.698 --> 55:02.960
What do you want?

55:03.066 --> 55:04.465
Can I come in?

55:04.567 --> 55:05.761
Come on.

55:09.339 --> 55:12.240
Gonna be a rehearsal downstairs
in 10 minutes.

55:12.342 --> 55:13.969
Oh, boy.

55:15.412 --> 55:18.472
We got a full day off next week.

55:22.352 --> 55:24.343
I'll be dead by next week.

55:31.027 --> 55:32.995
I'm taking the night off.

55:34.064 --> 55:37.625
You take tonight off...

55:38.968 --> 55:42.734
and, sure as hell, that'll be the night...

55:44.574 --> 55:49.273
that Mr. Network Radio Scout
is sitting out front and all the things...

55:50.213 --> 55:53.944
I mean, everything that we've been
doing goes right down the drain...

55:54.050 --> 55:58.851
because, let's face it, Billie,
you are the cream in our coffee.

55:59.456 --> 56:01.617
You got that the wrong way around,
don't you?

56:01.725 --> 56:04.592
We are just another band without you.

56:06.663 --> 56:07.823
Okay.

56:08.832 --> 56:12.063
Give me a shot of that bourbon
in my bag, will you?

56:15.305 --> 56:17.637
Well, how about a real...

56:19.609 --> 56:21.008
A real what?

56:21.745 --> 56:25.112
One shot and you'II...

56:25.782 --> 56:27.147
be flying.

56:28.084 --> 56:31.110
Look, Harry, like I've been telling you...

56:32.122 --> 56:34.249
what you do is your business.

56:34.357 --> 56:35.790
I may be tired, but I ain't dumb.

56:35.892 --> 56:39.350
You're walking across a street. A truck
hits you. You're laying in the street.

56:39.462 --> 56:42.363
They take you to the nearest hospital.
What's the first thing they do?

56:42.465 --> 56:46.401
They give you a shot of morphine.
Now, morphine ain't an aspirin.

56:46.503 --> 56:48.971
It's dope.

56:49.939 --> 56:52.533
Do you think that makes you an addict?

56:54.377 --> 56:57.278
One goddamn little shot ain't gonna...

56:58.214 --> 57:01.809
make you a junkie,
but, you know, it keeps you flying.

57:01.918 --> 57:05.410
Okay, Harry.
If I get hit by a truck, I'll call you, okay?

57:05.855 --> 57:07.584
Now get out of here.

57:21.938 --> 57:24.702
Reg, how much longer
before we get to the next town...

57:24.808 --> 57:27.902
- or a gas station or something?
- Well, from the looks of things...

57:28.011 --> 57:31.174
it's gonna be back roads
and cow pastures for quite a while yet.

57:31.281 --> 57:33.442
Pull over to a clump of bushes
or something then?

57:33.550 --> 57:34.915
- No.
- A hedge?

57:35.018 --> 57:36.781
- Come on, please.
- All right.

57:36.886 --> 57:39.753
You have but to ask, madam,
this vehicle is at your disposal.

57:39.856 --> 57:42.120
- How about the lake?
- Come on.

57:42.225 --> 57:43.522
All right.

57:46.796 --> 57:49.594
You should take a look at it out here.

57:49.699 --> 57:53.226
It's beautiful. Look at those trees.

58:00.610 --> 58:04.171
Hey, Billie. Where you going?
You forgot the sheet music.

58:04.280 --> 58:06.043
Just turn your head.

58:06.149 --> 58:07.776
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

59:01.004 --> 59:02.665
Come on, Billie.

59:07.944 --> 59:09.707
Let's go. All aboard.

59:48.785 --> 59:52.380
Southern trees

59:54.924 --> 59:59.827
Bear a strange fruit

01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:08.069
Blood on the leaves

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:13.972
And blood at the root

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:21.783
Here is a fruit

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:27.218
For the crows to pluck

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:34.058
For the rain to gather

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:40.095
For the wind to suck

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:51.106
For the sun to rot

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:57.575
For the tree

01:00:58.154 --> 01:01:03.091
To drop

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:11.866
Here is a strange

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:17.228
And bitter

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:23.945
Crop

01:01:34.924 --> 01:01:39.122
Now we're proud to present our
feature vocalist, Miss Billie Holiday.

01:01:44.133 --> 01:01:46.533
You're mean to me

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:49.503
Why must you be mean to me

01:01:49.605 --> 01:01:52.438
Gee, honey, it seems to me

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:55.238
You love to see me crying

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:57.574
I don't know why

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.615
I stay home
Each night when you

01:02:02.785 --> 01:02:07.051
Left all alone
Singing the blues and crying

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:12.760
You treat me coldly
Each day in the year

01:02:13.963 --> 01:02:17.228
You always scold me

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:22.604
Whenever you're mean to...

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:37.976
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:40.681
Miss Holiday has been experiencing
some dizzy spells.

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:43.486
I'm sure she'll be back with us
in just a little while.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:46.061
We will continue
with an instrumental right now...

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:48.653
and I'm sure she'll be all right.
Thank you very much.

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:49.993
Thank you.

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:56.471
But if you treat me right, Daddy

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.503
I'll stay home every day

01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:08.217
If you treat me right, Daddy

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:13.316
I'll stay home every day

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:18.556
But you're so mean to me, baby

01:03:19.662 --> 01:03:23.928
I know you're gonna drive me away

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:29.835
Love is just like a faucet

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:34.768
It turns off and on

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:41.147
Love is just like a faucet

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:46.179
It turns off and on

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:51.157
Sometimes when you think it's on, baby

01:03:51.727 --> 01:03:55.288
It has turned off and gone

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:02.435
How about singing
that Old Black Joe there, Billie.

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:04.233
Come on, now. Don't go.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.103
Sing Old Black Joe.

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:11.071
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:12.203
Thank you.

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:15.341
You know that ditty Old Black Joe,
don't you, honey, baby?

01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:19.512
Now, I'd love to do them all for you.
I'd love to do it for you...

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:21.590
but we got something planned here.

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:25.422
A little number called
What a Little Moonlight Can Do.

01:05:06.802 --> 01:05:11.068
You only shudder
'Cause your poor tongue

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:15.377
Just won't utter
The words

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:18.845
I love you

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:22.781
Miss Billie Holiday.
Let's give her another hand.

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:29.548
Hey, baby.

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:33.758
Baby, what you doing here?

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:38.166
Here, I've been trying
to get you on the phone. Oh, baby.

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:40.735
I missed you so much.

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:44.498
You look so good, baby.

01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:47.299
How'd you get here?

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:49.173
Get your clothes off.

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:54.514
I like your style,
but I can't say much for your timing.

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:57.177
Why don't we wait till we get home,
get a nice hot bath?

01:05:57.286 --> 01:05:58.275
No.

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:05.185
Whatever you say.
My, my, the man is ready.

01:06:05.294 --> 01:06:07.023
Well, so am I.

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:14.795
We've been having a rough tour.

01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:18.267
Baby, I'm so happy you're here.

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:22.903
Now, this is all I'm gonna do.

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.071
And I want you to do the rest.

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:29.048
You're hurting me.

01:06:29.752 --> 01:06:30.878
Jesus.

01:06:33.389 --> 01:06:34.754
All right, that's it. Come on, let's go.

01:06:34.857 --> 01:06:36.518
- I know what you're thinking.
- This tour's over.

01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:39.093
I'm the one who sent you here,
and I'm taking you back home...

01:06:39.195 --> 01:06:40.162
so get your things, let's go.

01:06:40.262 --> 01:06:41.729
Wait a minute.
I know what you're thinking.

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.230
I don't wanna hear about it.
Just come home.

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:44.560
I'm not hooked.

01:06:50.072 --> 01:06:52.063
No, I ain't going.

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:55.939
I ain't going, Louis.

01:06:59.648 --> 01:07:02.082
Billie, listen to me.

01:07:05.721 --> 01:07:06.745
All right.

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:13.562
Billie, it...

01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:18.794
Believe me when I tell you
that this is for your own good.

01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:20.630
Don't preach to me, Louis.

01:07:20.736 --> 01:07:23.967
All that I plan for you
is done with you in mind.

01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:26.940
You affect my whole life, baby.
I love you.

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:31.503
- Lf you go down, baby. I go down, too.
- I'm not going down...

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:35.881
because there ain't no place down there
I wanna be.

01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:41.145
Be going up, baby.
It'll just take a little time.

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:44.319
I love you, too. I love you.

01:07:46.195 --> 01:07:49.392
Sure, I've taken a few shots,
but only when I needed it...

01:07:49.498 --> 01:07:51.591
and I'm not hooked, Louis. Wait, baby.

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:56.228
Only when you needed it.
What do you think hooked is?

01:07:57.606 --> 01:08:01.167
All I had to do is listen to your voice
on the telephone, and I knew.

01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:02.471
Who do you think you're talking to?

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:05.172
One of those old fake cats
you be running around with?

01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:09.445
I've been on those streets all of my life.
I know what that shit is.

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:14.385
It's good, ain't it?

01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:17.420
Wait. Wait, wait.

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:21.158
We're going home, now.

01:08:23.064 --> 01:08:24.965
Wait, hey, baby, wait.

01:08:25.067 --> 01:08:27.058
See? You don't understand.

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:30.531
Now, you don't know how it is...

01:08:30.639 --> 01:08:34.131
when people are looking down at you
and laughing at you...

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:36.438
and think that I'm a loser.

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:39.514
And if I go home now,
I'll think that I'm one, too.

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:42.175
I gotta prove it to them,
I gotta prove it to myself.

01:08:42.283 --> 01:08:44.548
What're you proving with that needle?

01:08:44.653 --> 01:08:48.214
That you're not woman enough
to make it without a crutch...

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:51.960
a magic way out
when the going gets a little too rough?

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:55.819
I want you to make it, too, baby,
but not this way. Not this way.

01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:57.453
Okay.

01:08:57.832 --> 01:09:00.631
Okay, I promise you
I won't take any more stuff.

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:04.969
I promise you. I gotta stay out here.
You're gonna let me stay?

01:09:05.073 --> 01:09:07.667
- No.
- Louis, please.

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:11.371
I get it. I'll be big, and then I can work
at a good club, and we'll be together.

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:14.108
I promise you, I won't take
any more stuff. Come on, Louis.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.910
Come on, Louis,
won't you take your clothes off?

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:21.719
Come on, Louis, please. I can't go now.

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:23.883
I gotta take you home, baby,
because I know...

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.255
I ain't going.

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:29.991
Hey, Crazy Maurice and Weird Lucille
want us to go out there with them.

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:33.125
Lady, what do you have this door
locked for? You cool?

01:09:33.234 --> 01:09:35.135
I'm fine, Harry.

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:38.237
Come on in.

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:45.044
Well, there he is. How the hell are you?

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:47.212
He's fine.

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:55.481
I just dropped by to see
if you needed anything...

01:09:58.594 --> 01:10:00.186
like a trip back to the hotel
or something...

01:10:00.296 --> 01:10:02.730
but I guess you got it covered...

01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:06.232
- so I'll catch you later, okay?
- See you at the hotel.

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:09.369
Bye. See you at the hotel.

01:10:15.544 --> 01:10:17.375
Harry's a good friend.

01:10:22.017 --> 01:10:25.817
That's what every little girl needs,
a good friend like Harry.

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:30.356
Okay.

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:36.662
I'm gonna get some gas for the car,
and I'll take you back to the hotel.

01:10:39.134 --> 01:10:40.192
Louis...

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:45.034
I love you.

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:51.075
I promise you. No more stuff, okay?

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:53.074
I promise you.

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:09.221
Nine.

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:10.923
- Come on, Billie.
- Five.

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:12.933
- Eight.
- Seven.

01:11:13.135 --> 01:11:14.159
Here we go, babe.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.067
$2 she hits them.

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:26.540
- Jesus Christ!
- What?

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:28.617
Billie, get out of sight.

01:11:28.717 --> 01:11:29.809
- Billie, come on.
- No, goddamn.

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:31.078
Billie, get out of sight.
