WEBVTT

00:11.579 --> 00:13.781
Still think we're making
a mistake here, hon.

00:13.814 --> 00:17.385
You know how Melissa hates
birthdays, and surprises.

00:17.418 --> 00:20.054
She says that, but I don't think
she really feels that way.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.423
She is gonna
regret the day

00:22.456 --> 00:24.592
she ever gave us
a key to her house.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.294
Trust me, it'll put
a smile on her face

00:26.327 --> 00:28.129
when she gets home tonight.
Well...

00:28.162 --> 00:31.265
I think I'll put this on
the breakfast room table.

00:31.299 --> 00:32.700
Okay.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.271
Now, what the hell's
the good of an alarm

00:37.305 --> 00:38.472
if you don't turn it on?

00:38.506 --> 00:40.141
She must've been
in a hurry.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.310
She had to be in court
early this morning.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.311
Oh, geez...

00:43.344 --> 00:44.612
CHRISTINE:
Alan!

00:44.645 --> 00:46.647
Oh, God! Oh, God!

00:46.680 --> 00:48.716
Alan, get her down!

00:48.749 --> 00:49.783
Get her down!

00:49.817 --> 00:51.285
Oh, God!

00:51.319 --> 00:54.455
Oh, God, no!

00:54.488 --> 00:56.490
*

01:26.854 --> 01:29.590
BISHOP:
Oh, she's so cute.

01:29.623 --> 01:30.824
Oh!

01:30.858 --> 01:32.393
Look at that little guy.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.428
What a dude.

01:34.462 --> 01:37.131
They don't look any different
than they did yesterday.

01:37.165 --> 01:38.532
BISHOP: They are
adorable, McGee.

01:38.566 --> 01:41.202
And they are so different.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.436
I mean, Johnny sleeps
all the time.

01:42.470 --> 01:45.373
And Morgan,
Morgan is nonstop active.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.141
It's like they're two
distinctive personalities,

01:47.175 --> 01:48.576
and Delilah and I...

01:48.609 --> 01:51.145
Bishop, remind me what we used
to talk about every morning,

01:51.179 --> 01:52.380
before McGee had twins?

01:52.413 --> 01:53.447
GIBBS:
Morning.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.216
Morning, Boss.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.384
Hey. You got new pictures?

01:56.417 --> 01:57.451
Yeah. Look at that.
Ah.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.687
By the way,

01:59.720 --> 02:01.589
HR called.
They said that today

02:01.622 --> 02:04.425
is the last day to update the
photo on your new credential.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.462
I hate my new photo.

02:08.496 --> 02:11.432
They took it on a bad day,
after a rough night.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.700
Can't be that bad.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.235
Whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

02:14.268 --> 02:15.369
Taking a look.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.505
TORRES:
Wait, come on, man...

02:17.538 --> 02:18.706
See, I hate that
I said anything.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.674
BISHOP: You were right,
Nick, that is...

02:20.708 --> 02:22.843
unflattering.
Bishop.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.378
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.514
I can't live
with that, man. No way.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.849
Well, maybe they'll let you
take another one.
I tried, bro.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.385
I went down to HR, they got
real nasty, real uppity.

02:31.419 --> 02:32.886
They thought I was
"criticizing their work."

02:32.920 --> 02:34.188
GIBBS:
Okay.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.489
On our way.

02:35.523 --> 02:36.890
GIBBS: Got a dead
JAG officer.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.726
Come on. Let's go.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.235
Time of death?

02:47.268 --> 02:48.536
Around 7:00 a.m.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.404
But as Dr. Mallard always says,

02:50.438 --> 02:51.539
:
"I'll be more precise

02:51.572 --> 02:53.441
when I get her
on my table, Jethro."

02:57.445 --> 03:00.248
Her only phone,
no landline.

03:00.281 --> 03:03.517
We didn't find a suicide note.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.453
What about the parents?

03:05.486 --> 03:07.688
Well, in denial.

03:10.324 --> 03:13.494
ALAN: We know our daughter,
Agent Bishop.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.929
Melissa did not
take her own life.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.665
BISHOP: When's the last time
you spoke to her?

03:17.698 --> 03:21.001
Talk... we talk ev...

03:21.034 --> 03:23.437
almost every day.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.839
Has she sounded
depressed lately?

03:25.873 --> 03:27.475
No. Just the opposite.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.310
Maybe a fight with a friend?
Someone at work?

03:29.343 --> 03:30.744
No. She loved her job.
No. Mm-hmm.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.547
She's proud to be a JAG lawyer.

03:33.581 --> 03:36.317
It sounds old-fashioned,
but all she ever wanted to do

03:36.350 --> 03:39.320
was help people
and serve her country.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.988
ALAN: I mean, I don't think
she was ever... happier.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.490
She just got engaged

03:42.523 --> 03:46.327
to this great guy, David.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.495
Have you...

03:47.528 --> 03:49.463
Find anything, Agent Gibbs?

03:49.497 --> 03:52.300
Mr. Newhall, we're just
beginning our investigation.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.667
This is crazy.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.836
This morning, we were coming
to surprise Melissa

03:55.869 --> 03:58.038
for her birthday, and now...

03:58.071 --> 04:00.508
Either of you notice
anything unusual?

04:01.975 --> 04:02.910
Her behavior, maybe?

04:02.943 --> 04:04.745
No.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.780
No.
Yes.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.417
The alarm.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.951
The alarm was off
when we arrived.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.321
She's religious about
setting the alarm,

04:13.354 --> 04:14.688
especially when she's
alone in the house.

04:14.722 --> 04:15.756
CHRISTINE:
That's true.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.826
She was really good about that.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.629
McGEE:
Lieutenant Melissa Newhall

04:21.662 --> 04:22.796
was an only child.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.565
She grew up
in rural Pennsylvania.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.800
Had poor grades in high school,
but she went to junior college,

04:26.834 --> 04:29.770
got straight As, and earned
a scholarship to Georgetown,

04:29.803 --> 04:31.038
where she was Phi Beta Kappa.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.406
That's impressive.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.474
McGEE: Well, it gets
more impressive.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.608
She was top
in her law school class,

04:34.642 --> 04:36.344
and made law review.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.779
Lieutenant Newhall turned down a
lot of lucrative law firm offers

04:38.812 --> 04:40.414
to become a JAG lawyer.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.782
I wonder why she'd do that?

04:41.815 --> 04:44.618
Well, I called her CO,
and he was in court today,

04:44.652 --> 04:45.819
observing proceedings.

04:45.853 --> 04:46.954
I'm waiting to hear back.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.589
Who?
Captain Bud Roberts.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.724
I know him.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.092
I phoned her fiancé,
David Crocker,

04:52.125 --> 04:53.761
but I haven't heard back
from him yet.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.329
Parents haven't been able
to reach him, either.

04:55.363 --> 04:57.665
All right. I'll be in autopsy.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.737
Dr. Palmer.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.806
Got a blood draw here for Abby.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.576
You got anything for me?
Maybe.

05:08.609 --> 05:11.545
Found some fresh bruising,
which suggests a struggle.

05:11.579 --> 05:14.748
I also found some other bruising
which appears to be older.

05:14.782 --> 05:17.351
Here, here and here.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.552
Could be
domestic abuse.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.721
Is there a spouse?
No, there's a fiancé.

05:20.754 --> 05:24.091
And he's not returning
our calls.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.596
Hey.
Hey.

05:28.629 --> 05:29.730
Where'd you go?

05:29.763 --> 05:30.931
Um, well, I was going
to get a Caf-POW!,

05:30.964 --> 05:32.065
and I ran into Sloane,

05:32.099 --> 05:33.667
who was going
to the coffee cart,

05:33.701 --> 05:35.102
so I joined her.
Oh.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.103
What, uh, what did you do
to your finger?

05:36.136 --> 05:37.605
Nothing. I mean,

05:37.638 --> 05:38.606
well, I got a splinter.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.574
But don't tell Gibbs.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.576
'Cause he'll try to, like,
dig it out with a knife.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.745
Thought you had a hack
for splinters. Banana peel?

05:44.778 --> 05:45.746
I tried it. Didn't work.

05:45.779 --> 05:46.847
Oh.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.081
By the way, your, uh, printer

05:48.115 --> 05:49.717
spit something out
while you were gone.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.720
Oh, it's the results of
Lieutenant Newhall's blood work.

05:52.753 --> 05:56.924
And I see you cracked
her password protection.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.892
No suicide note
in the computer.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.428
I'm scrolling
through her search history.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.095
There's nothing suicide-related
here at all.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.998
Some online shopping,
movie reviews,

06:05.032 --> 06:07.000
and her hometown newspaper.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.503
I'm gonna check,
see what apps she has.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.672
Okay, so the lieutenant
was sedated

06:11.705 --> 06:13.707
at the time of her demise.

06:13.741 --> 06:14.808
Diazepam.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.744
Well, that's interesting.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.679
We didn't find any prescription
drugs at her house.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.948
Just a few vitamin supplements.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.484
Sometimes, suicide victims will
use it to relax themselves

06:23.517 --> 06:24.852
so they don't
change their minds.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.820
Well, and sometimes, killers
will drug their victims

06:26.854 --> 06:28.889
in order to stage
a fake hanging.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.858
McGee.

06:30.891 --> 06:31.959
She has a
video diary.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.827
My friend Carol
has that same app.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.696
She keeps trying
to talk me into using it.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.830
Well, let's see
if her innermost thoughts

06:36.864 --> 06:37.965
help our investigation.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.802
ABBY: It looks like she made
an entry every single day,

06:41.835 --> 06:44.538
until three days ago,
and then, nothing.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.507
Friday night.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.041
Long day at work today.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.878
Uh, happy to meet David
for sushi.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.846
Mostly discussed the wedding.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.182
It appears we have
very different ideas.

06:55.215 --> 06:59.152
Uh, he's thinking elaborate
destination wedding,

06:59.186 --> 07:02.890
and that's not for me.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.826
Somehow, we'll work it all out.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.528
She seems so positive.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.630
Oh, I have an appointment...
Yeah.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.632
to look
at wedding dresses tomorrow.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.066
Mom wants to come,

07:13.100 --> 07:15.769
but I think I need to narrow it
down to a few choices

07:15.803 --> 07:17.838
before getting her involved.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.741
Or she'll make me crazy.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.476
That's it.

07:22.510 --> 07:23.844
I'm tired.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.979
Good night.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.180
ABBY:
Okay.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.149
That does not sound like someone

07:29.182 --> 07:31.151
who was about to take
their own life.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.697
BISHOP: David Crocker,
Lieutenant Newhall's fiancé,

07:43.731 --> 07:45.933
works for a small
PR firm in Reston.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.536
I called his office, and they
said something came up,

07:48.569 --> 07:50.604
and he made an unscheduled
flight to New York,

07:50.638 --> 07:51.605
early this morning.

07:51.639 --> 07:52.840
Shades of O.J.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.141
How early this morning?

07:54.174 --> 07:55.976
Took the shuttle,
New World Airlines,

07:56.009 --> 07:57.745
flight 23.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.913
Left at 9:00
from Reagan National,

07:59.947 --> 08:02.683
and he has a return ticket
on the 3:00 p.m.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.251
Okay. Meet the plane, Torres.
Yes, sir.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.919
As for the lieutenant's phone,

08:05.953 --> 08:08.689
she exchanged recent calls
with three people:

08:08.722 --> 08:11.759
her parents, her fiancé and
her best friend, Kerry Lyons.

08:11.792 --> 08:12.693
Who I spoke to.

08:12.726 --> 08:13.861
She still lives in her hometown,

08:13.894 --> 08:15.095
Eastbourne, Pennsylvania.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.797
She's a social worker,
and she was the last one

08:16.830 --> 08:18.198
to talk to the lieutenant.
So when was this?

08:18.231 --> 08:19.867
6:05 this morning.

08:19.900 --> 08:20.868
Yeah, she wanted to be
the first one to say

08:20.901 --> 08:22.035
happy birthday to her friend.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.904
Ms. Lyons is on her way here now

08:23.937 --> 08:25.172
to console the parents.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.974
The lieutenant also made
several outgoing calls

08:27.007 --> 08:28.576
to a prepaid phone number.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.877
I've called,

08:29.910 --> 08:32.880
and only got a recording.

08:32.913 --> 08:33.881
Left two messages.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.916
SULTRY WOMAN :
Hi, this is Rita.

08:35.949 --> 08:39.119
I can't get to the phone
right now, so leave a message.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.922
I don't want to miss your call.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.891
I spoke to the clerk
at the JAG office.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.959
Rita is not
a co-worker,

08:45.993 --> 08:48.295
and there's no one by that name
who works in the building.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.763
Did you ask the parents?

08:49.797 --> 08:50.931
Yeah. And the best friend.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.000
Neither of them know
who Rita is.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.039
Uh, good to see you, Gibbs.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.273
Yeah, good to see you, too, Bud.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.175
Wish it was under
different circumstances.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.011
Yeah. A real shocker.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.679
Took her own life?

09:05.713 --> 09:07.080
I don't buy it.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.983
See, Lieutenant Newhall,
she was a good officer.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.284
A great lawyer.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.820
She had her head on straight.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.822
Yeah. Well, as you know,

09:14.855 --> 09:17.891
we handle suicides the same way
as we do homicides:

09:17.925 --> 09:19.292
with a death investigation.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.061
Was she well
Absolutely.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.730
What kind of cases she handle?
Little bit of both.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.165
She preferred to defend,
but when called upon,

09:25.198 --> 09:27.134
she was a-a fierce prosecutor.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.136
She had some enemies?

09:29.169 --> 09:31.038
You're agreeing with me,
aren't you, Gibbs?

09:31.071 --> 09:32.706
You don't think
it was a suicide.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.108
Investigating
all the possibilities, Bud.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.712
There was a case a few years ago

09:38.746 --> 09:41.314
where she put a petty officer
away for spousal abuse.

09:41.348 --> 09:42.883
And he threatened
her in court.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.217
Um, let me look it up.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.057
GIBBS: You meet
the fiancé?

09:50.090 --> 09:50.858
Yeah, a couple times. He, uh...

09:50.891 --> 09:54.094
a little too stiff
for m... my taste,

09:54.127 --> 09:55.896
but she was happy.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.230
Yeah, here it is. Valencia.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.066
Carlos Valencia.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.802
Court-martialed June 2015.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.204
He was released.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.806
When?

10:05.839 --> 10:08.809
Two weeks ago.

10:08.842 --> 10:12.212
Sometimes, you just know
the accused is guilty.

10:12.245 --> 10:15.115
That's how it was with
Petty Officer Valencia.

10:15.148 --> 10:18.085
I knew this morning,
when I walked into that room,

10:18.118 --> 10:19.920
that it wouldn't take long
for the court member panel

10:19.953 --> 10:20.921
to convict him.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.122
You found it.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.925
Yup. Night of Valencia's
court-martial.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.393
You know, Lieutenant Newhall
talked to this diary

10:26.426 --> 10:28.261
almost every day for five years.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.230
There's over 45 hours
of video here.

10:30.263 --> 10:33.066
I got to say,
I was a little upset

10:33.100 --> 10:35.068
when he went on a rant
threatening me.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.137
That was a first.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.305
But I'm sure
a good night's sleep

10:38.338 --> 10:40.941
will help put it out of my mind.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.813
Looks like she didn't take
that threat very seriously.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.147
Find out where
Valencia is now.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.782
Get the video
up to Sloane.

10:48.816 --> 10:51.118
Maybe she'll find something--
a pattern, a motive.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.119
Gladly.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.854
Listening to her private
thoughts and confessions

10:53.887 --> 10:55.889
was creeping me out.

10:55.923 --> 10:58.158
It's like when I was a kid
and I found my sister's diary.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.893
Torres pick up the fiancé?
Yeah.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.995
He and Bishop have him
in Interrogation.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.463
I landed in New York,

11:03.496 --> 11:07.067
there were messages on
my phone from the office,

11:07.100 --> 11:09.002
Melissa's dad and NCIS.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.904
I just got this sick
feeling in my stomach,

11:10.938 --> 11:13.774
and I... I knew something
must have happened to her.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.809
But...

11:17.177 --> 11:18.746
I never would
have guessed this.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.014
She seem upset the
last time you saw her?

11:21.048 --> 11:23.050
She has been a little
preoccupied recently.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.051
How recently?

11:24.084 --> 11:25.152
Started over the weekend.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.887
The last three days,

11:26.920 --> 11:31.892
she's just been
acting... strangely.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.061
N-Not her usual self.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.062
Did you say anything?

11:35.095 --> 11:36.129
I tried talking to her.

11:36.163 --> 11:39.767
She just, she wasn't open
like she usually was.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.334
I attributed it to

11:41.368 --> 11:43.203
nervousness about the wedding.

11:43.236 --> 11:46.940
Where were you at
7:00 a.m. this morning?

11:49.309 --> 11:51.745
My apartment.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.246
Rushing to get to the airport.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.948
Anyone see you?
I don't know.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.283
I don't think so.
You want to tell us

11:56.316 --> 11:58.051
how your fiancé
got those bruises?

11:58.085 --> 12:00.220
What?
Come on, man.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.455
She had bruises--
old ones, new ones--

12:02.489 --> 12:04.191
all over her arms and torso.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.160
I-I wasn't aware.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.129
How's that possible?

12:09.162 --> 12:12.465
Look, I know this
is gonna sound strange.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.034
I thought so, too.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.169
But Melissa was committed

12:16.203 --> 12:19.072
to remaining celibate
until she was married.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.908
That's why we
didn't live together.

12:20.941 --> 12:24.878
We were... we were
never intimate.

12:37.390 --> 12:40.527
JIMMY: Uh, Bishop?
We have a problem.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.230
Contrary to what
he just told you,

12:43.263 --> 12:45.198
Lieutenant Newhall
was not celibate.

12:45.232 --> 12:48.301
JIMMY: Autopsy and forensics
indicate that she did have sex,

12:48.335 --> 12:50.237
in the last 72 hours.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.905
I collected DNA.

12:51.939 --> 12:55.208
And hopefully, I will be able
to identify her partner.

13:04.617 --> 13:08.221
MELISSA: It's 2:00 a.m. and
I am just now going to bed.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.123
I stayed up and
watched Roman Holiday

13:10.157 --> 13:12.893
for the umpteenth time.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.162
Audrey Hepburn was so gorgeous.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.229
Hmm.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.264
Things were so...

13:17.297 --> 13:22.235
simple and romantic back then.

13:22.269 --> 13:25.072
I think I was born
50 years too late.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.541
Come in.

13:28.575 --> 13:29.542
You have a minute?

13:29.576 --> 13:31.912
Hey, yeah, for you, always.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.246
Have a seat.
Thanks.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.848
Your, uh, your
door's usually open.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.016
Yeah.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.151
I was watching the
lieutenant's diaries.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.253
I wanted to respect her privacy.

13:40.287 --> 13:42.956
Hey, can we believe the fiancé?

13:42.990 --> 13:44.257
That they weren't
actually intimate?

13:44.291 --> 13:45.258
Yeah.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.294
She talks about it all the time,

13:47.327 --> 13:50.030
how she appreciated
his patience,

13:50.063 --> 13:51.264
and it's kind of cool.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.100
Well, Jimmy and Abby
are positive

13:53.133 --> 13:55.168
that she was sexually active.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.204
Any indication she was
seeing somebody else?

13:57.237 --> 13:59.206
Not so far.
Could she have been raped?

13:59.239 --> 14:01.174
Jimmy collected DNA.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.542
There haven't been recordings

14:02.575 --> 14:04.211
for, like, three days, so...

14:04.244 --> 14:05.078
Anything's possible.

14:05.112 --> 14:07.047
I still have several
more hours to watch.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.082
So, hopefully, I'll
come up with something.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.184
All right, well,
let me know if you do.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.185
Yeah. Hey.
Hmm?

14:12.219 --> 14:14.121
Want a lollipop?
Oh.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.424
Green.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.292
Yes!

14:19.326 --> 14:20.093
How did you know?

14:20.127 --> 14:21.561
'Cause you have
a gigantic heart.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.164
Thank you.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.901
MELISSA:
I am gonna pay the price

14:27.935 --> 14:29.970
tomorrow, though, for staying up
and watching the movie.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.105
We have a staff meeting

14:32.139 --> 14:33.306
first thing in the morning.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.309
Is that Lieutenant Newhall's
voice?

14:36.343 --> 14:37.277
Yeah.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.679
What?

14:39.712 --> 14:40.948
Play it again.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.084
I am gonna pay the price
tomorrow, though,

14:44.117 --> 14:45.585
for staying up and
watching the movie.

14:45.618 --> 14:48.455
We have a staff meeting
first thing in the morning.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.024
CHRISTINE:
I think Melissa

14:51.058 --> 14:54.127
would have liked to
wear her white uniform.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.495
I think so, too.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.264
She loved summer.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.968
There's so much to do.
I don't know where to start.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.302
Mrs. N, we don't have to

15:02.335 --> 15:04.004
do everything today.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.638
Let's just get
through the funeral,

15:05.672 --> 15:07.507
and I'll stay as long
as you need me.

15:07.540 --> 15:11.044
What would I do
without you, Kerry?

15:11.078 --> 15:12.712
You were always like
a second daughter to me.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.615
You know, I can't find any
of her important documents.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.284
I've searched her desk,
everywhere.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.685
They'll show up.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.323
Excuse me.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.363
NCIS. Special Agent Nick Torres.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.465
Kerry?
Thanks for meeting me here.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.506
I just didn't want to leave
Melissa's parents alone.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.042
They're really taking it hard.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.243
Especially her mother.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.145
I understand.
Come inside.

15:46.613 --> 15:47.647
Good morning.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.149
Uh...

15:49.182 --> 15:50.750
I just have a few
questions for Kerry

15:50.783 --> 15:53.253
since she was the last one
to speak to your daughter.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.422
We can talk in the
kitchen, Agent Torres.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.456
TORRES:
Sure.

15:59.192 --> 16:03.296
It's been so hard on them.

16:03.330 --> 16:06.566
They were the greatest parents.
Melissa was so lucky.

16:06.599 --> 16:10.770
When you spoke
to Melissa yesterday,

16:10.803 --> 16:12.672
did you sense that
anything was wrong?

16:14.607 --> 16:17.444
No.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.279
It was just...

16:19.312 --> 16:21.281
all about her birthday.

16:21.314 --> 16:24.284
And we just laughed
about past ones.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.119
I'm sorry.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.154
No problem.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.358
David Crocker,
her fiancé.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.625
What can you tell me about him?

16:32.659 --> 16:36.063
The love of her life.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.765
To her, Mr. Perfect.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.067
And to you, too?

16:41.501 --> 16:44.504
For Melissa, yeah.

16:44.537 --> 16:48.041
Her love life, in general?

16:48.075 --> 16:49.109
What do you mean?

16:49.142 --> 16:50.277
Other boyfriends?

16:50.310 --> 16:51.678
No.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.414
No others, actually.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.316
Ever?

16:56.349 --> 16:59.386
Just never seemed
to care until David.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.122
What about high school?

17:02.155 --> 17:04.424
Nope.

17:04.457 --> 17:05.758
This important somehow?

17:05.792 --> 17:06.759
It might be.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.399
Truth is, um...

17:12.432 --> 17:14.601
And I mean,
I don't know for sure,

17:14.634 --> 17:17.070
but I guess I can tell you now,

17:17.104 --> 17:20.607
I just... I don't think
she cared that much.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.442
About?

17:24.477 --> 17:28.815
I just always suspected Melissa
might be...

17:28.848 --> 17:32.552
asexual, just not into anybody,

17:32.585 --> 17:33.820
either sex.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.492
RITA:
Hi, this is Rita.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.428
I can't get to
the phone right now,

17:41.461 --> 17:42.829
so leave a message.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.464
I don't want to miss your call.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.432
Now...

17:45.465 --> 17:47.734
this a voice sample
of Lieutenant Newhall

17:47.767 --> 17:49.469
from her diary.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.404
MELISSA: I am gonna pay
the price tomorrow, though,

17:51.438 --> 17:52.739
for staying up and
watching the movie.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.542
We have a staff meeting
first thing in the morning.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.711
They sure sound like
the same person, don't they?

17:58.745 --> 18:01.514
I'm doing a voice comparison
with my audio software.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.350
Did you run the DNA
Jimmy found on the body?
I did.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.652
Compared it to the fiancé.
It's not him.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.587
And I assume you didn't get
a match in the database

18:07.620 --> 18:08.588
or you would've led with that.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.557
Mm, you would assume correctly.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.493
Oh, but I can tell you
that he is male, Caucasian,

18:13.526 --> 18:16.563
predominately
European ancestry,

18:16.596 --> 18:19.332
and has markers
for pattern baldness.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.570
Oh, well.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.538
You have very
discerning ears, Bishop.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.540
My audio software
agrees with you.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.542
98% assurance

18:29.576 --> 18:33.413
that Lieutenant Newhall and
Rita are one and the same.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.517
I appreciate the info.
Thanks very much.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.919
Boss, Carlos Valencia
has an alibi.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.921
He was 200 miles away
yesterday morning

18:41.954 --> 18:45.558
in a mandated re-entry
program for parolees.

18:45.592 --> 18:46.626
So much for the angry defendant.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.331
Oh, thanks, Billy.
Yes, sir.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.667
What did Billy bring?

18:54.701 --> 18:57.504
Let's see.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.239
Some new photo IDs.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.875
Ugh, what a doofus.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.512
I can't live with that
for five years, man.

19:05.545 --> 19:08.381
And of course the camera
loves Bishop.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.217
What, does she have
a wind machine?

19:12.452 --> 19:13.686
What?!

19:17.357 --> 19:19.926
Gibbs, this looks like
your old picture, man.

19:21.694 --> 19:22.495
BISHOP:
Hey, McGee.

19:22.529 --> 19:24.431
Ping this number.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.433
It's Rita's prepaid phone.
See if you can get a location.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.235
Oh, you got something, Bishop?

19:28.268 --> 19:30.370
Lieutenant Newhall is Rita.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.705
Wait... wait, explain.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.374
So the voice on
the prepaid number

19:34.407 --> 19:35.708
Lieutenant Newhall was
calling is her own.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.344
They're one and the same person.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.578
McGEE:
Phone is active.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.513
It's on the 2100 block
of M Street.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.315
Go.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.826
It's coming from
down the street.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.695
I think I know how
to solve the problem.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.564
I'm just gonna tell them
I lost my creds.

19:57.597 --> 20:01.301
Then they're gonna have to
issue a new one. Boom!

20:01.334 --> 20:02.902
Well, they will
once they've completed

20:02.935 --> 20:04.704
their 2B investigation.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.539
Yeah, he's right, Nick.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.708
No...

20:08.741 --> 20:10.643
All right, phone's in the hotel.

20:15.682 --> 20:18.385
HOST :
...to advance to the lightning
round and a chance to...

20:18.418 --> 20:19.586
This is getting crazier.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.554
Why would the lieutenant
have anything to do

20:21.588 --> 20:22.589
with a place like this?

20:25.492 --> 20:27.627
Can I help you?

20:27.660 --> 20:29.496
Federal agents.
You got a minute?
Maybe.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.597
You got an ID?

20:30.630 --> 20:34.000
ID.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.470
Navy cops?

20:37.504 --> 20:38.805
BISHOP: Yup. You
recognize her?

20:40.473 --> 20:42.742
Rita's in the Navy?

20:49.882 --> 20:52.519
All right, I'll call
Rita's number.

21:07.767 --> 21:11.771
This has just gotten...
very weird.

21:20.913 --> 21:24.351
Very, very weird.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.718
Look at this.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.987
She's got the same
diary app on her phone.

21:28.020 --> 21:31.424
Last time it was used
was three days ago.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.928
Barry just left.

21:35.962 --> 21:39.532
The pain was incredible.

21:39.566 --> 21:42.702
He knows how much I crave it.

21:44.604 --> 21:47.607
Oh, does he now?

22:01.120 --> 22:03.456
All the contacts
are just first names.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.924
Sound male, mostly.

22:04.957 --> 22:07.694
Rick, Matt, Justin, Damon,

22:07.727 --> 22:09.729
list keeps going.

22:09.762 --> 22:13.099
Last few calls were to this,
uh, Barry guy she mentioned.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.468
Let's see if this belonged
to Barry.

22:15.502 --> 22:16.669
We'll run it. See if
we can get a print.

22:16.703 --> 22:17.837
BISHOP:
Diazepam.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.540
Prescription is
in Melissa Newhall's name.

22:20.573 --> 22:21.641
Well, we still have
another few hours

22:21.674 --> 22:22.709
of Rita's diaries to go through.

22:22.742 --> 22:23.843
TORRES: Let's run
Barry's number.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.812
See if we can
get a last name.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.580
Yeah, bet he's got
a story to tell.

22:27.614 --> 22:30.517
There has to be some kind
of a mistake.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.585
Melissa would never
do any of those things.

22:32.619 --> 22:33.853
SLOANE: Kerry, we know
this is hard to hear.

22:33.886 --> 22:36.489
Didn't Agent Torres
tell you what I said?

22:36.523 --> 22:38.024
Yes, but that doesn't change
what we found.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.726
Listen to me.

22:39.759 --> 22:43.863
Melissa never even cared
about guys until David.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.799
And now you're
telling me she's out

22:46.833 --> 22:49.035
with a different one
every night,

22:49.068 --> 22:51.604
asking them to hurt her?

23:01.080 --> 23:03.516
She was lying to me.

23:03.550 --> 23:06.085
I'm sorry.

23:08.154 --> 23:13.893
I just, I already had
to say good-bye to her once.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.995
And now...

23:16.028 --> 23:19.098
Now you have to mourn
the person you thought she was.

23:22.869 --> 23:25.672
Why would she do this?

23:25.705 --> 23:27.507
Well, when someone
leads a double life,

23:27.540 --> 23:30.543
it's almost always the result
of an acute traumatic event.

23:30.577 --> 23:32.779
Can you think of anything

23:32.812 --> 23:34.447
that-that might've
happened to her?

23:34.481 --> 23:37.016
No.

23:37.049 --> 23:41.888
And up until today, I thought
she told me everything.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.657
Oh, my God, her parents.

23:44.691 --> 23:45.892
What about them?

23:45.925 --> 23:47.093
You can't tell them about this.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.661
It would kill them.

23:48.695 --> 23:50.463
Kerry, this is
an open investigation.

23:50.497 --> 23:53.099
Unfortunately, we can't
make those promises.

23:53.132 --> 23:56.703
Please. Melissa was
hiding this from everyone.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.838
She didn't want people to know.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.106
I'm still her best friend.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.841
I have to protect her memory.

24:08.548 --> 24:12.151
This place smells
like old cheese.

24:12.184 --> 24:15.021
Well, that's him.

24:17.023 --> 24:18.725
Excuse me, Barry Goode.

24:20.527 --> 24:21.961
NCIS. Need to talk to you.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.029
TORRES:
Uh, McGee.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.997
You got the wrong guy, bro.

24:25.031 --> 24:26.633
Nah, I don't think so.

24:26.666 --> 24:29.569
Uh, seriously, dude,
that's the wrong guy.

24:29.602 --> 24:33.706
Oh. My bad. Sorry.

24:33.740 --> 24:36.809
Barry Goode. NCIS.
Yeah.

24:36.843 --> 24:39.045
Heard your boyfriend there
give a speech to the wrong guy.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.913
Look, in my defense,
you look a lot more washed-up

24:40.947 --> 24:42.882
than you do in your photo ID,
okay?

24:42.915 --> 24:44.584
TORRES :
Damn.

24:44.617 --> 24:45.885
See, bad things happen

24:45.918 --> 24:47.654
when you don't look
like your picture, man.

24:47.687 --> 24:48.821
I mean, I don't have
that problem, though.

24:48.855 --> 24:49.756
I... my issue is that

24:49.789 --> 24:51.090
when you take a picture
of me with a camera,

24:51.123 --> 24:52.825
I look better in person

24:52.859 --> 24:54.561
'cause the camera doesn't
capture my-my bone structure.

24:54.594 --> 24:55.928
Isn't that weird?

24:55.962 --> 24:57.630
That's-that's-that's
kind of an issue.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.566
Okay, I'm not sure
that's your issue.
Uh...

24:59.599 --> 25:01.934
Whoa, Barry. Where you think
you're going, buddy?

25:01.968 --> 25:03.903
I got a thing against talking
to guys who iron their clothes.

25:03.936 --> 25:04.804
You know this woman?

25:04.837 --> 25:08.207
I know lots of women.
Her name is Rita.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.077
Doesn't ring a bell.

25:11.110 --> 25:13.145
What about her being dead?
Does that ring a bell?

25:13.179 --> 25:14.246
Might want to think
real long and hard

25:14.280 --> 25:15.748
before you answer that, Barry,

25:15.782 --> 25:18.084
'cause we've got DNA
and I bet

25:18.117 --> 25:20.653
it'll prove that you and Rita
knew each other pretty well.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.989
We hung out a couple times.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.256
Did you fight a lot when
you were hanging out?

25:24.290 --> 25:26.225
Fight? No, we screwed.

25:26.258 --> 25:28.027
You put hands on her, man.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.261
She had bruises.

25:29.295 --> 25:31.330
Look, I did what she asked,
okay?

25:31.363 --> 25:32.932
She liked it rough.

25:32.965 --> 25:34.166
Too rough for me, even.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.335
Where were you yesterday
at 7:00 a.m.?

25:36.368 --> 25:37.770
I work baggage at Dulles.

25:37.804 --> 25:39.105
Graveyard shift.

25:39.138 --> 25:40.773
You want proof?

25:40.807 --> 25:42.008
There's cameras
all over the airport.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.142
Do your job.

25:43.175 --> 25:45.712
Oh. That's great
advice. Thank you.

25:48.715 --> 25:51.618
That's the kind of guy that goes
through your checked luggage.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.019
Yeah, man, this
place is nasty.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.253
Make sure you
wash your hands

25:54.286 --> 25:56.756
before you hug
your kids tonight.

25:56.789 --> 26:00.627
David wanted to cook dinner
for me tonight.

26:00.660 --> 26:04.631
He had the whole thing planned.

26:04.664 --> 26:08.367
When I told him I had
to work late, he...

26:08.400 --> 26:11.704
he was hurt.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.072
I could see it.

26:13.105 --> 26:15.141
I... I keep thinking

26:15.174 --> 26:18.277
once we get married, something's
gonna have to change.

26:18.310 --> 26:23.215
I am gonna have to change.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.652
Watch this.

26:28.821 --> 26:32.091
It's late. Past 3:00.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.127
I'm here alone.

26:35.161 --> 26:39.265
I thought for sure I would meet
someone tonight, but...

26:39.298 --> 26:41.634
everyone was talking
like it mattered

26:41.668 --> 26:45.137
and I don't like it
when they ask more than my name.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.807
So...

26:47.840 --> 26:50.342
here I am.

26:50.376 --> 26:52.912
What'd you see?

26:52.945 --> 26:55.114
These two videos,

26:55.147 --> 26:57.349
taken a month ago
on the same day.

26:57.383 --> 27:00.687
Yeah, but she lied to her fiancé
about where she was going.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.288
What is that?
Split personality?

27:02.321 --> 27:03.723
No.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.992
Dual life.
It's a big difference.

27:06.025 --> 27:09.095
She's the same person whether
she's going by Melissa or Rita

27:09.128 --> 27:10.863
and she's fully aware
of all of her actions.

27:10.897 --> 27:12.031
Why pretend to be someone
you're not?

27:12.064 --> 27:13.099
I don't know.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.133
Why do you do it?

27:14.166 --> 27:18.237
Why do I do it?

27:18.270 --> 27:19.839
Why does anyone do it?

27:19.872 --> 27:22.174
Both of these lives
are very much Melissa,

27:22.208 --> 27:23.375
but unlike most of us,

27:23.409 --> 27:26.012
she feels the need
to keep them separate.

27:26.045 --> 27:27.714
She's scared.
Yeah.

27:27.747 --> 27:30.182
Fear and guilt are
two peas in a pod, Gibbs.

27:30.216 --> 27:31.383
The physical abuse

27:31.417 --> 27:33.052
that she seeks out as Rita

27:33.085 --> 27:35.788
suggests that she is punishing
herself for something.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.924
Yeah, or it's something
she thinks she did.

27:37.957 --> 27:40.226
A person who records their
thoughts this compulsively

27:40.259 --> 27:44.130
is someone who wants to be
heard, but feels she isn't.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.432
My guess, that feeling
was ingrained in her

27:46.465 --> 27:47.834
from an early age.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.468
You think as a kid
she had a diary?

27:49.501 --> 27:51.704
If she did,
I'd like to see it.

27:51.738 --> 27:53.773
It would help me complete
my profile, that's for sure.

27:53.806 --> 27:56.809
All right. Find the trigger.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.715
Christine, we don't need
to take everything right now.

28:02.749 --> 28:04.483
These were really
important to her.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.152
I don't want to lose them.
Okay.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.319
I'm sorry. Don't worry.

28:11.824 --> 28:13.860
Agent Gibbs, you
found something?

28:13.893 --> 28:15.828
This is
Special Agent Sloane.
Hello. Hi.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.830
You have proof that Melissa
didn't commit suicide?

28:17.864 --> 28:19.131
No, we're still investigating.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.066
Well, how can we help you?

28:20.099 --> 28:21.133
Do you know if Melissa

28:21.167 --> 28:23.035
kept a diary when
she was a kid?

28:23.069 --> 28:25.204
Yes. Always.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.473
But I-I couldn't tell
you what was in it.

28:27.506 --> 28:30.176
She was protective of it and
we respected her privacy.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.510
Do you know where it is?

28:31.543 --> 28:33.045
I-I know that she
took it with her

28:33.079 --> 28:34.213
when she moved out
after law school,

28:34.246 --> 28:35.281
but we just went
through all of her things.

28:35.314 --> 28:36.448
I didn't see it. Did you?

28:36.482 --> 28:38.918
No. Why do you ask?

28:40.419 --> 28:42.054
Do you think it could tell you

28:42.088 --> 28:44.156
that she didn't
do this to herself?

28:44.190 --> 28:45.457
It's possible.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.827
We have to find it.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.396
I-I'll go, I'll go look again.

28:52.398 --> 28:55.768
Um, Christine
can only cope

28:55.802 --> 28:57.436
with the hard times
by convincing herself

28:57.469 --> 28:59.238
it didn't happen.

28:59.271 --> 29:03.109
She'll never believe that
our daughter took her own life.

29:03.142 --> 29:05.277
You read Melissa's diary.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.446
Yeah.

29:07.479 --> 29:11.150
She was 15 and
I was desperate.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.786
I only got ten pages in...

29:13.820 --> 29:16.155
...before she
came home and made me stop.

29:16.188 --> 29:18.157
I don't know what she
did with it after that.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.792
Why were you desperate?

29:23.195 --> 29:26.232
She was a great kid who turned
into a troubled teen.

29:26.265 --> 29:30.236
She was stealing
and drinking

29:30.269 --> 29:32.471
and skipping school.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.340
But during her senior year,

29:34.373 --> 29:35.842
she turned her life around.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.276
She became
a different person.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.511
What happened?
I don't know.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.313
She wouldn't tell me.

29:41.347 --> 29:42.481
I'm sure she wrote about it,

29:42.514 --> 29:46.118
but it wasn't in
the ten pages that I read.

29:46.152 --> 29:48.287
Whatever it was, it...

29:48.320 --> 29:51.390
it changed
her life forever.

30:02.368 --> 30:03.602
WOMAN: Got something
for you, Nick.

30:03.635 --> 30:06.405
Ah, thank you.

30:07.606 --> 30:09.575
Uh, who is that
with Torres?

30:09.608 --> 30:11.878
JIMMY:
No idea.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.045
Hey, where's Gibbs?

30:13.079 --> 30:15.181
On his way up.
Should be here any minute.

30:15.214 --> 30:16.415
Hey, who was that?
Huh?

30:16.448 --> 30:19.151
Huh?
The woman you were just talking
to on the staircase.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.219
Oh, that's Jody.

30:20.252 --> 30:21.553
She's new.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.055
She works at HR.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.025
She processed my new creds.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.027
BISHOP:
What?

30:28.060 --> 30:29.929
That looks like it was taken
by Annie Leibovitz.

30:29.962 --> 30:31.430
JIMMY:
You wearing makeup there, Nick?

30:31.463 --> 30:33.099
Or is that Photoshopped?

30:33.132 --> 30:35.267
Now, that's a picture
I can live with.

30:35.301 --> 30:36.936
There's Gibbs.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.205
Autopsy report.
You find anything?

30:39.238 --> 30:41.207
Nothing I haven't already
told you.
Hey, Jimmy.

30:42.274 --> 30:43.642
Abby needs you.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.577
BISHOP:
Uh, how much did you

30:45.611 --> 30:46.946
tell the parents?
GIBBS:
Not much.

30:46.979 --> 30:48.214
But the father told us
that Melissa

30:48.247 --> 30:49.315
had a juvenile arrest record

30:49.348 --> 30:51.450
and she kept a diary as a teen.

30:51.483 --> 30:53.185
I'm going to my
office, folks.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.421
We got to find the diary.
Call the fiancé.

30:55.454 --> 30:58.524
See if he knows anything
about a diary.
Okay.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.126
But what do I tell him
about her secret life?

31:00.159 --> 31:01.327
Do I keep it from him?

31:01.360 --> 31:03.195
He's gonna find out eventually.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.365
ABBY: Ow, ow!
JIMMY: Sorry. Sorry.

31:06.398 --> 31:08.134
It's getting infected.

31:08.167 --> 31:09.535
You should really
see a doctor.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.070
You are a doctor, Jimmy.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.438
Just get it out.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.006
Well, you're
awfully grouchy today.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.207
You all right?

31:15.241 --> 31:16.976
Something
bothering you?

31:17.009 --> 31:18.277
Sorry.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.478
Yeah.

31:19.511 --> 31:22.214
It's Lieutenant Newhall.

31:22.248 --> 31:25.317
Like, instead of talking
to her diary,

31:25.351 --> 31:28.520
she should have been sharing
her problems with someone.

31:28.554 --> 31:33.559
You know, like-like her friends,
or... her parents, her fiancé.

31:33.592 --> 31:34.693
Yeah, you're right.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.062
She needed help.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.296
She could've
gotten it, too.

31:37.329 --> 31:41.633
You know, the Navy's got several
suicide prevention programs.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.936
The Military Crisis Line,

31:43.970 --> 31:45.604
they listen without judgment

31:45.637 --> 31:48.574
and they offer great support.

31:48.607 --> 31:50.342
Got it.

31:50.376 --> 31:53.312
Thank you.
Yeah, now we just
need some antiseptic.

31:53.345 --> 31:54.646
I have that in here.

31:57.183 --> 31:59.251
JIMMY: Hey, McGee. I'm gonna go
get Lieutenant Newhall's body

31:59.285 --> 32:00.286
ready for transport.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.656
Abby, I blew it.
I really screwed up.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.658
I'm sure you're exaggerating.
You're a great agent.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.094
What happened?

32:08.127 --> 32:11.097
Two days ago I noticed
that Lieutenant Newhall

32:11.130 --> 32:12.965
had Googled her
hometown newspaper.

32:12.999 --> 32:15.034
I was gonna check it out,
but I got sidetracked

32:15.067 --> 32:17.669
with the video diary and
I didn't follow up until now.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.038
So what's the problem?

32:19.071 --> 32:20.172
Look at this.

32:20.206 --> 32:25.177
ABBY: "Body of Teacher Missing
Fourteen Years Found."

32:25.211 --> 32:27.346
He was suspected of abusing
his female students,

32:27.379 --> 32:30.016
but he disappeared
before charges were made.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.650
Local police assumed
he just ran away.

32:31.683 --> 32:33.719
14 years ago?

32:33.752 --> 32:36.355
Melissa Newhall would have
been a teenager.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.424
You think she was
one of his victims?

32:38.457 --> 32:40.059
It's likely.

32:40.092 --> 32:41.527
Small town, one high school.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.162
Ooh.

32:53.305 --> 32:57.276
You think you
know someone so well.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.545
Guess I didn't
know her at all.

32:59.578 --> 33:02.448
We appreciate you
helping us out.

33:03.549 --> 33:06.118
So, where are we looking?

33:06.152 --> 33:07.386
In the living room.

33:07.419 --> 33:08.254
Melissa's passport expired;

33:08.287 --> 33:10.322
she needed to renew it
for our honeymoon.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.558
So, I saw where
she kept all her valuables.

33:16.795 --> 33:19.598
We were going to Bali.

33:28.640 --> 33:32.744
I didn't see a diary,
but I wasn't really looking.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.467
MELISSA:
"Our parents think Mr. Paull...

33:55.501 --> 33:59.071
"...is such a nice man,
but he's really a scuzzball.

33:59.105 --> 34:00.372
MELISSA/SLOANE:
"He creeps us out

34:00.406 --> 34:02.241
"the way he stares at us
on the field.

34:02.274 --> 34:03.809
"He thinks he can get away
with anything...

34:03.842 --> 34:07.546
but Kerry and I are gonna
teach him a lesson."

34:08.547 --> 34:11.517
That was the last entry
she made.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.851
After he went missing,

34:12.884 --> 34:14.853
local police
started investigating,

34:14.886 --> 34:16.822
and the girls started talking.

34:16.855 --> 34:18.824
It became quite evident

34:18.857 --> 34:23.262
that Emmett Paull abused
and molested female students.

34:23.295 --> 34:27.399
Possibly Melissa Newhall
and Kerry Lyons.

34:27.433 --> 34:30.302
14 years later, Paull's body
is found buried in the woods.

34:30.336 --> 34:32.704
McGee came across
a curious thing

34:32.738 --> 34:35.507
when he was going through
Lieutenant Newhall's computer.

34:35.541 --> 34:39.445
She never visited the Web site
of her hometown newspaper

34:39.478 --> 34:41.513
until the day
the body was found.

34:41.547 --> 34:44.650
And then, she checked it
the next three days,

34:44.683 --> 34:46.285
and then she was dead.

34:46.318 --> 34:47.353
GIBBS:
"Kerry and I

34:47.386 --> 34:49.288
are going to teach him
a lesson."

34:49.321 --> 34:50.689
That's incriminating,
especially now

34:50.722 --> 34:53.225
that the teacher's
buried remains were found.

34:53.259 --> 34:55.661
Wait, wait, wait.
That was the trigger.

34:55.694 --> 34:58.830
Killing the teacher is why
Melissa became Rita.

34:58.864 --> 35:00.232
She was seeking out these

35:00.266 --> 35:03.402
dangerous,
violent sexual encounters

35:03.435 --> 35:06.138
to punish herself
for what she did 14 years ago.

35:06.172 --> 35:07.773
Yeah, but that still
doesn't tell us

35:07.806 --> 35:09.375
whether she was murdered
or committed suicide.

35:09.408 --> 35:10.609
SLOANE:
My opinion--

35:10.642 --> 35:11.543
suicide.

35:11.577 --> 35:12.611
She feared

35:12.644 --> 35:14.613
the police investigation
would reveal her secrets,

35:14.646 --> 35:16.315
past and present.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.884
She couldn't juggle
both her lives

35:18.917 --> 35:20.219
and felt there was
no other way out.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.220
GIBBS:
Or it was murder.

35:21.253 --> 35:23.789
Her friend Kerry thought
that Melissa would break

35:23.822 --> 35:26.225
and confess
to killing the teacher.

35:26.258 --> 35:27.626
I mean, that's hard to prove.

35:27.659 --> 35:29.861
The words in her diary aren't
exactly a confession.

35:29.895 --> 35:32.498
Kerry doesn't know what it says.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.712
Agent Sloane.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.315
This room's a little
more intimidating

35:49.348 --> 35:51.450
than where we met
the last time.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.652
Kerry, this is
Special Agent Gibbs.

36:00.292 --> 36:02.494
You know what this is?

36:02.528 --> 36:04.963
Melissa's diary.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.899
Melissa was a compulsive writer,
Kerry.

36:07.933 --> 36:09.668
She wrote it all down.

36:09.701 --> 36:13.805
About "getting even
with Mr. Paull."

36:15.507 --> 36:18.344
Do you want to tell us
what happened?

36:18.377 --> 36:20.812
How did you "get even"?

36:23.949 --> 36:25.684
We were just gonna scare him.

36:25.717 --> 36:28.454
We didn't mean for him to die.

36:28.487 --> 36:29.621
How did he die?

36:34.660 --> 36:38.730
We lured him into the woods,
not far from school.

36:38.764 --> 36:41.667
He was willing;
we knew he would be.

36:41.700 --> 36:45.904
When he saw we brought rope,
it excited him.

36:45.937 --> 36:48.607
He let us tie him up.

36:48.640 --> 36:53.879
When Melissa took out
the camcorder, he panicked,

36:53.912 --> 36:56.615
and we threatened to torture him

36:56.648 --> 37:00.852
unless he confessed to
molesting girls at school.

37:00.886 --> 37:04.256
He... gasped

37:04.290 --> 37:05.757
and breathed hard.

37:05.791 --> 37:07.626
And at first we thought
he was faking,

37:07.659 --> 37:10.396
but... he was
having a heart attack.

37:10.429 --> 37:15.301
And we became hysterical,
arguing about what to do and...

37:17.303 --> 37:18.804
He died.

37:18.837 --> 37:21.807
We buried the body...

37:21.840 --> 37:26.512
and prayed
he'd never be found.

37:26.545 --> 37:30.582
We never spoke
of that night again.

37:30.616 --> 37:32.984
Until the body was found
last week.

37:33.018 --> 37:37.423
The minute I heard it
on the news,

37:37.456 --> 37:39.658
I called Melissa.

37:39.691 --> 37:42.528
She freaked.

37:42.561 --> 37:46.532
We talked several times
over the next couple days.

37:46.565 --> 37:49.568
And I tried to convince her
that after all these years,

37:49.601 --> 37:52.504
they'd never tie us to it.

37:52.538 --> 37:54.706
But she didn't believe me.

37:59.110 --> 38:02.348
Then I called her
on her birthday.

38:02.381 --> 38:05.384
She said her life was over.

38:05.417 --> 38:08.420
She didn't want to talk
about it anymore and hung up.

38:08.454 --> 38:09.688
What did you do?

38:09.721 --> 38:12.724
I got in my car and...

38:12.758 --> 38:15.394
hoped to get to her house
to calm her down.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.996
I got to Melissa's place.

38:18.029 --> 38:20.699
Using my own key,

38:20.732 --> 38:22.734
I went inside...

38:24.102 --> 38:25.737
...and turned off the alarm.

38:28.707 --> 38:32.010
But I was too late.

38:35.581 --> 38:36.982
Melissa was dead.

38:40.018 --> 38:41.753
I found a handwritten

38:41.787 --> 38:44.390
suicide note.

38:46.057 --> 38:47.459
It incriminated us

38:47.493 --> 38:50.996
in Mr. Paull's death.

38:51.029 --> 38:54.666
And she said good-bye
to everybody.

38:54.700 --> 38:59.037
I took it... and ran.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.809
For your sake,
I hope you didn't destroy it.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.044
No.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.380
:
I kept it.

39:09.715 --> 39:12.017
What happens now?

39:12.050 --> 39:13.118
GIBBS: That's up to
the authorities

39:13.151 --> 39:14.386
in Pennsylvania.

39:14.420 --> 39:15.554
They'll consider all

39:15.587 --> 39:16.855
the circumstances, Kerry.

39:16.888 --> 39:20.559
Your age, his actions.

39:22.761 --> 39:24.162
Yeah, they were only 15.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.764
And he a predator.

39:25.797 --> 39:28.534
SLOANE: Well, if they
believe Kerry, like I do,

39:28.567 --> 39:30.536
the teacher died
of a heart attack.

39:30.569 --> 39:33.038
When I get home,
I am hugging my kids.

39:33.071 --> 39:35.641
Does anybody want to have a
drink over at the Adams House?

39:35.674 --> 39:37.676
My treat.

39:37.709 --> 39:38.510
Yeah, sure.

39:38.544 --> 39:39.845
SLOANE: I'm in.
GIBBS: Nope, can't.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.747
One more thing I got to do.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.915
Break the news to
Lieutenant Newhall's parents.

39:46.852 --> 39:49.187
I got to take a rain check.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.722
Gibbs, wait up.

39:52.023 --> 39:54.092
Pardon.

39:55.126 --> 39:56.795
I'm going with you.

40:04.503 --> 40:08.640
This is one of the
obligations of the job...

40:08.674 --> 40:10.942
I will never feel
comfortable with.

40:14.613 --> 40:17.949
It's hard when people hold
things inside and keep secrets.

40:17.983 --> 40:20.051
My gut?

40:21.853 --> 40:24.623
You're speaking
from experience.
