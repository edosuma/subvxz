<i>The Client List...</i>

00:01.589 --> 00:02.793
Have you ever heard
of sploshing?

00:02.794 --> 00:05.732
Hello, Judge Overton.
I'm not sure how much longer

00:05.733 --> 00:07.399
I can keep them
away from her.

00:07.434 --> 00:08.801
Oh, my God.

00:08.836 --> 00:09.936
You understand?
No!

00:09.970 --> 00:11.037
Hey!

00:11.071 --> 00:13.039
His name
is Greg Carlyle.

00:13.073 --> 00:15.374
He owns Wild Nights.
That place is very dangerous.

00:15.408 --> 00:17.443
You two rookies ready
for a little undercover work?

00:17.477 --> 00:19.997
What's the assignment, Lieutenant?
Prostitution. Massage parlor.

00:20.013 --> 00:21.914
And you two pretty boys
are bait.

00:21.949 --> 00:23.149
It's not my neck
that's stiff.

00:24.351 --> 00:26.119
Um...
Beaumont police.

00:26.153 --> 00:27.653
You are under arrest.

00:27.687 --> 00:29.889
Greg Carlyle
owns the Lucky Lotus?

00:29.923 --> 00:31.958
You give me that list or you're
gonna get back on the pole.

00:31.992 --> 00:33.926
The client list
holds a lot of power.

00:33.961 --> 00:35.728
Make sure
it's good and hidden.

00:35.763 --> 00:37.630
Someone broke into my house.
What am I gonna do?

00:37.664 --> 00:39.431
And the client list
is safe, isn't it?

00:39.466 --> 00:41.267
Yeah, it's safe.
I've been real careful.

00:41.301 --> 00:42.668
But do you think
it was Carlyle?

00:42.702 --> 00:43.561
I want you
to come home.

00:43.562 --> 00:45.663
Undercover
officers arrested several women

00:45.664 --> 00:47.131
under suspicion
of prostitution.

00:47.607 --> 00:49.508
Saying this is part
of a larger investigation

00:49.542 --> 00:51.610
scheduled to ramp up
across the state.

01:03.157 --> 01:05.825
So?
Is that everything?

01:05.859 --> 01:07.626
Yep.

01:08.962 --> 01:11.297
That's it.

01:15.169 --> 01:16.635
I'm home.

01:16.670 --> 01:19.172
Well...

01:19.206 --> 01:20.873
Welcome home.

01:26.046 --> 01:28.080
God, I missed this.

01:30.684 --> 01:32.451
And this.
Oh, yeah?

01:32.485 --> 01:33.452
Mm-hmm.

01:43.730 --> 01:46.398
Kyle?

01:55.075 --> 01:56.709
Too soon?

02:00.047 --> 02:01.747
Yeah, too soon.

02:01.781 --> 02:04.416
Okay.

02:04.451 --> 02:06.585
You're right.

02:06.619 --> 02:09.420
We don't have to
rush anything.

02:11.925 --> 02:13.192
Mom!
Travis.

02:13.227 --> 02:14.894
Mom.

02:14.928 --> 02:17.063
Hey, buddy.
You're supposed to knock.

02:17.097 --> 02:18.931
I know, but the Broncos
have practice,

02:18.966 --> 02:20.733
and I can't find
my football jersey.

02:20.767 --> 02:22.268
It's okay.
Yeah.

02:22.302 --> 02:25.104
It's okay. Come on.
Let's go find that jersey.

02:32.779 --> 02:34.580
All right, Henry.
You all set?

02:34.614 --> 02:36.582
Let's get you tacked up
and ready to ...

02:36.616 --> 02:37.917
Ready to ride?

02:37.951 --> 02:39.385
I got him all saddled up
and everything.

02:39.419 --> 02:41.020
What are you doing here?

02:41.054 --> 02:43.356
Came by to see
my buddy Henry.

02:43.390 --> 02:44.623
And you, of course,

02:44.657 --> 02:46.125
since you ran
out of my place last night

02:46.159 --> 02:47.226
like a bat
out of hell.

02:47.261 --> 02:49.228
Well, I can't help it.
I'm a busy girl.

02:49.263 --> 02:50.629
That's why I came by.

02:50.663 --> 02:51.931
You're telling me
that you had

02:51.965 --> 02:53.532
nothing better to do
this morning

02:53.566 --> 02:55.234
than to come by here
and hang out with my horse?

02:55.269 --> 02:56.802
Well, there are a few things
that come to mind.

02:56.836 --> 02:58.704
Stop!

02:58.738 --> 03:00.273
We're not alone.
Come on.

03:00.307 --> 03:01.473
Oh, I don't think
he minds.

03:02.609 --> 03:04.110
Look, Derek.

03:04.144 --> 03:07.646
You and me,
we're like vampires ...

03:07.680 --> 03:09.648
true creatures
of the night.

03:09.682 --> 03:11.417
That's when
we really click.

03:11.451 --> 03:13.986
But I'm not a vampire.
And this isn't "Twilight."

03:14.021 --> 03:16.923
I'm just a normal guy
who likes to do normal things,

03:16.957 --> 03:19.258
like wake up next to you
in my bed,

03:19.293 --> 03:20.259
have breakfast together.

03:20.294 --> 03:21.493
Well,
I don't do breakfast.

03:21.528 --> 03:23.162
Fine.
How about a movie?

03:24.497 --> 03:26.565
All right, fine.
We'll do a movie.

03:26.599 --> 03:28.067
But just a movie.
Mm-hmm.

03:28.101 --> 03:30.169
Doesn't include breakfast
in bed. And I get to pick.

03:30.203 --> 03:31.503
Of course you do.

03:31.538 --> 03:33.439
Don't you worry,
my little vampire.

03:33.473 --> 03:36.108
We'll make it
a late show.

03:37.377 --> 03:40.246
So long, Henry.
Get out of here.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.181
You know what ... I think
that the clothing monster

03:42.215 --> 03:44.116
is holding this jersey
hostage.

03:44.151 --> 03:45.117
Mom...

03:45.152 --> 03:46.685
is it okay if the team

03:46.719 --> 03:48.321
sleeps over Saturday
after the game?

03:48.355 --> 03:50.856
I thought that Ben's mother
was hosting that sleepover.

03:50.890 --> 03:52.158
But she got the flu.

03:52.192 --> 03:53.659
Yeah, well,
I have to work,

03:53.693 --> 03:55.428
and you know that
my busiest days are Saturdays.

03:55.462 --> 03:57.830
Please? Pretty please?
I'm gonna think about it.

03:57.864 --> 03:59.432
Come on!
I know what that means!

03:59.466 --> 04:00.967
Yeah, it means
I'm gonna think about it!

04:01.001 --> 04:02.935
- No, it doesn't!
- Riley!

04:02.970 --> 04:04.170
It means "no" again!

04:04.204 --> 04:05.271
Riley!

04:05.305 --> 04:06.839
Kids' room!

04:07.807 --> 04:09.541
Aha!
What is the point

04:09.576 --> 04:11.344
of you having a cellphone
if you don't answer it?

04:11.378 --> 04:13.346
Oh, I'm sorry. Good morning.
Hi. How are you?

04:13.380 --> 04:15.181
You're not gonna believe this.
I can't even believe it.

04:15.215 --> 04:17.183
Wait.
Lacey, what is going on?

04:17.216 --> 04:19.024
There's a baby!
I mean, there could be a baby.

04:19.024 --> 04:19.571
What?!

04:19.586 --> 04:21.187
We could be having a baby.
Are you pregnant?!

04:21.221 --> 04:23.489
Why do I keep saying "baby"?
How can that be?

04:23.523 --> 04:25.157
No, I'm ... I'm not.

04:25.192 --> 04:26.725
Pregnant, I mean.

04:26.759 --> 04:28.560
I mean...

04:28.595 --> 04:30.463
after everything
that happened,

04:30.497 --> 04:34.133
Dale and I decided
to look into adoption.

04:34.167 --> 04:35.801
You didn't
say anything.

04:35.835 --> 04:37.203
We barely
filled out the paperwork,

04:37.237 --> 04:38.670
and next thing I know,
they're calling us saying

04:38.705 --> 04:40.539
that there's a birth mother
that wants to meet us.

04:40.573 --> 04:42.674
But first, we have to pass
the home inspection in two days.

04:42.709 --> 04:44.743
Can you believe it?
God, Lacey, that is incredible!

04:44.777 --> 04:46.078
I know, but we have to
baby-proof the house,

04:46.113 --> 04:47.346
and I don't even
know where to start.

04:47.381 --> 04:49.081
I've got tons of stuff
in the garage.

04:49.116 --> 04:50.716
You don't mind if we use it?
I would do anything

04:50.750 --> 04:52.485
for my future niece or nephew.
Aww.

04:52.519 --> 04:54.053
So, Dale and I can
come by later and pick it up?

04:54.087 --> 04:55.587
Yes, I'll have Kyle get it
all together for you.

04:55.622 --> 04:57.490
Oh, my God, Riley.

04:57.524 --> 04:58.924
I feel like I'm dreaming.

04:58.958 --> 05:00.893
Oh, is this real?
Somebody pinch me.

05:00.927 --> 05:02.228
Ow!

05:02.262 --> 05:03.229
That hurt!

05:04.297 --> 05:05.731
Sorry.
You said pinch you.

05:05.765 --> 05:08.534
But this is really happening, isn't it?
It is!

05:09.769 --> 05:11.637
Oh, my God.

05:14.107 --> 05:15.374
No.
No scary movies.

05:15.409 --> 05:17.243
If I wanted to watch
two hours of torture,

05:17.277 --> 05:18.511
I'd have dinner
with my mother.

05:18.545 --> 05:19.945
Hey, you two.

05:19.979 --> 05:22.048
Oh, it's okay.
We all know you're a couple.

05:22.082 --> 05:23.416
Didn't know
you had it in you.

05:23.450 --> 05:25.617
We're just...
having fun.

05:25.652 --> 05:28.254
Exactly.
Just tons of fun.

05:28.288 --> 05:30.256
Well, I'm really glad
you guys cleared that up for me.

05:30.290 --> 05:32.624
Okay, everybody.
Let's pay attention, please.

05:32.659 --> 05:34.793
Now, tomorrow, we are
gonna close up shop and we are

05:34.827 --> 05:36.762
heading to River Knolls
for a golf tournament.

05:36.796 --> 05:38.431
Michelle, this is gonna be
a great time for you

05:38.465 --> 05:39.798
to get your hours in
for your license.

05:39.832 --> 05:42.368
Uh, I got my hours,
so am I off the hook?

05:42.402 --> 05:44.103
Not a chance.
What ...

05:44.137 --> 05:45.737
Why in the world
are we doing this?

05:45.772 --> 05:47.440
Because Georgia's husband
needs our help.

05:47.474 --> 05:48.941
He lost his sponsor,
and I said we'd do it.

05:48.975 --> 05:50.776
Now, we are gonna do
chair massages

05:50.810 --> 05:52.378
for all the golfers
and the attendees.

05:52.412 --> 05:53.651
Who the heck
would want to golf there?

05:53.652 --> 05:54.557
It's a terrible design.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.275
You lose half your balls
on the ninth hole.

05:57.417 --> 05:58.984
What? I golf.

05:59.018 --> 06:01.387
It's for a great cause,
okay?

06:01.421 --> 06:03.255
All the proceeds are gonna
be benefiting soldiers who

06:03.280 --> 06:04.290
are coming home from war.

06:04.291 --> 06:06.092
I'm in.
Me too.

06:06.126 --> 06:07.893
That's the spirit.
See you guys at 8:00.

06:07.927 --> 06:09.295
Riley! Wait!

06:09.329 --> 06:10.729
Wait! Riley!

06:10.763 --> 06:12.264
I can't believe
you're asking me to do this.

06:12.299 --> 06:13.665
- Not asking.
- I'm telling.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.067
Well, I'm gonna lose
a bucket of money.

06:15.102 --> 06:16.469
I don't care.
I want all hands on deck.

06:16.503 --> 06:18.170
Oh. Fine.

06:18.205 --> 06:20.672
Then I guess these hands
better get to work, then.

06:20.707 --> 06:22.774
All right. Listen up.

06:22.809 --> 06:25.111
Officer Parks
and Officer Trimble,

06:25.145 --> 06:26.412
this is a great honor ...

06:26.446 --> 06:28.247
one that should not
be taken lightly.

06:28.281 --> 06:30.682
This Texas Rangers badge
gives you jurisdiction

06:30.717 --> 06:32.585
all over
the state of Texas.

06:35.188 --> 06:37.623
Your promotion
to this task force proves

06:37.657 --> 06:40.759
that good work
does not go unrecognized.

06:41.961 --> 06:43.862
Now get out there
and kick ass.

06:43.896 --> 06:45.164
Born to kick ass,
sir.

06:45.198 --> 06:46.798
Yes!

06:46.833 --> 06:48.767
But you'll be slumming with us
for a few more days,

06:48.801 --> 06:51.970
and you and Trimble
are working security tomorrow ...

06:52.005 --> 06:53.606
the River Knolls
Golf Club.

06:53.640 --> 06:54.940
Dismissed.

06:54.974 --> 06:56.842
We're on
a friggin' task force!

06:56.876 --> 06:59.345
This is gonna be epic.

06:59.379 --> 07:00.979
Hey, two-for-one shots
at the Lonestar Tavern.

07:01.014 --> 07:02.381
You coming?
I'm good.

07:02.415 --> 07:05.618
Okay, more ladies for me,
then.

07:05.652 --> 07:07.486
He gets douchier
by the day.

07:07.521 --> 07:09.121
That douche
gets punched in the face

07:09.156 --> 07:10.523
and still gets promoted.

07:10.557 --> 07:11.823
Total B.S.

07:11.858 --> 07:14.026
You're the best cop
in this squad.

07:14.060 --> 07:15.494
You know this is wrong.

07:15.529 --> 07:17.163
It'll be fine.

07:22.769 --> 07:25.204
Oh, I'm sorry.
Damn allergies.

07:25.238 --> 07:27.039
Can we skip
to the main course?

07:27.073 --> 07:28.474
How about we start
with an appetizer?

07:28.508 --> 07:30.209
Oh. What'd you have
in mind?

07:30.243 --> 07:31.743
Well, you know
you're amazing, right?

07:31.778 --> 07:33.546
Sniffles and all?

07:33.580 --> 07:36.148
And I cannot stop thinking
about more than one of you.

07:36.183 --> 07:37.683
Okay, well,
that's gonna be tricky,

07:37.717 --> 07:39.318
'cause my cloning machine
is in the shop.

07:39.352 --> 07:41.987
I guess
I just got to spit it out.

07:42.021 --> 07:45.057
What I would love
is you...

07:45.091 --> 07:46.892
and two other girls.

07:46.926 --> 07:49.428
I have, uh, heard of
thinking outside the box...

07:49.462 --> 07:51.530
Come on. It'll be fun.

07:51.565 --> 07:53.666
The other two
can just watch.

07:53.700 --> 07:55.201
Or...join in.

07:55.235 --> 07:56.935
You know,
whatever works for you.

07:56.969 --> 07:58.770
All right,
that sounds...

07:58.805 --> 08:00.339
Interesting.

08:00.373 --> 08:02.341
Um, you know what?

08:02.375 --> 08:04.876
Let me check the schedules
and talk to the girls about it,

08:04.911 --> 08:06.845
and we'll see
if we can't...

08:06.879 --> 08:08.947
Work something out
for next time.

08:10.550 --> 08:13.085
I'm getting excited
just thinking about it.

08:13.119 --> 08:14.687
Yes, I can certainly see
that you are.

08:15.922 --> 08:18.257
So, shall we seize
the moment?

08:18.291 --> 08:20.125
Carpe diem away.

08:20.159 --> 08:22.394
Okay.

08:24.464 --> 08:26.765
Vroo... boom!

08:28.268 --> 08:30.668
Buddy, I told your mom that
we were gonna clean up this mess.

08:30.670 --> 08:31.637
Do I have to?

08:31.671 --> 08:33.371
Oh, I'm afraid so.

08:33.405 --> 08:34.773
Okay.

08:34.807 --> 08:35.974
Hey, Dad.
Yeah?

08:36.008 --> 08:37.208
Is it okay
if the team sleeps over

08:37.244 --> 08:38.577
tomorrow after the game?

08:38.611 --> 08:40.979
The whole team?
That's a lot of kids.

08:41.013 --> 08:42.748
I know,
but nobody else can do it,

08:42.782 --> 08:44.583
and I told them
that my dad was back,

08:44.618 --> 08:46.585
and they want you
to show us some plays.

08:46.620 --> 08:48.887
Oh, you did, did you?

08:48.921 --> 08:50.456
You're good.

08:50.490 --> 08:51.557
So that's a "yes"?

08:51.591 --> 08:52.891
What'd your mom say?

08:52.925 --> 08:54.793
She said to ask you.

08:55.828 --> 08:57.129
If it's all right
with her...

08:58.632 --> 09:00.028
...I guess it's all right
with me, too.

09:00.053 --> 09:00.499
Yes!

09:00.500 --> 09:01.600
We're gonna have
the best sleepover

09:01.635 --> 09:03.235
the Beaumont Broncos
ever had.

09:03.270 --> 09:06.104
But first, I need you
to clean up that mess, boy.

09:06.139 --> 09:07.573
Thanks, Dad.

09:10.109 --> 09:11.343
Sorry I'm running late.

09:11.378 --> 09:13.845
I promise
I'll make it up to you.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.514
Or...maybe I'm early,

09:15.548 --> 09:17.316
'cause that's not
your birthday suit.

09:20.287 --> 09:21.520
What's wrong?

09:21.554 --> 09:23.455
I don't want you
getting all riled up.

09:23.490 --> 09:24.990
But just do me a favor?

09:25.024 --> 09:28.427
Don't take any new business
for a while.

09:28.461 --> 09:31.363
You mean no new clients
on the list? What's going on?

09:31.398 --> 09:33.766
Nothing I can talk about
right now. I wish I could.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.268
No,
you don't understand.

09:36.303 --> 09:38.537
I have a family ...

09:38.571 --> 09:40.205
people that really
depend on me.

09:40.239 --> 09:41.674
If something
is going on ...

09:41.708 --> 09:44.042
Nothing going on.
Everything's just fine.

09:44.076 --> 09:45.711
Just ... just be careful.

09:45.745 --> 09:47.045
I always am.

09:47.079 --> 09:49.381
I'm just erring
on the side of caution.

09:49.416 --> 09:53.552
Now, you know I never
come here empty-handed.

09:55.054 --> 09:56.388
Uh...I can't.

09:56.423 --> 09:57.656
Unh.

09:57.691 --> 10:00.125
I won't take "no"
for an answer.

10:00.159 --> 10:03.261
Then I guess
I can't say "no."

10:04.864 --> 10:08.166
All right, look,
you're not a new client.

10:08.201 --> 10:10.736
And you have
49 minutes left, so...

10:10.770 --> 10:13.038
let's make it count.

10:13.072 --> 10:14.506
I insist.

10:14.541 --> 10:16.842
You can walk all over me
any day of the week.

10:29.792 --> 10:31.760
Massages?

10:31.794 --> 10:33.862
By the Rub of Sugar Land?
Really?

10:33.896 --> 10:35.697
Riley,
what are you thinking?

10:35.732 --> 10:36.965
Good to see you, too.

10:36.999 --> 10:39.133
You do know
why I'm selling you the spa?

10:39.168 --> 10:40.769
So Harold
doesn't find out.

10:40.803 --> 10:42.604
Exactly ... to keep what we do
away from Harold,

10:42.638 --> 10:45.474
not to ... no pun intended ...
rub it in his face.

10:45.508 --> 10:46.621
Harold was in a bind.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.643
Honey, there are
just too many variables here ...

10:48.644 --> 10:51.880
the clients, the girls,
the great outdoors!

10:51.914 --> 10:53.482
The tournament is
on the up-and-up.

10:53.516 --> 10:55.717
Okay? There's no need
to operate in the shadows.

10:55.752 --> 10:57.686
That is the only way
to operate ...

10:57.720 --> 11:00.689
keep a low profile,
stay out of the spotlight.

11:00.723 --> 11:02.691
That's the way
you did things.

11:03.693 --> 11:04.959
Wait a minute.

11:04.994 --> 11:07.696
What's going on here?

11:07.730 --> 11:09.998
It's Kyle, isn't it?

11:10.032 --> 11:12.401
He's back,
and you're thinking ...

11:12.435 --> 11:13.902
I'm not thinking
anything.

11:13.936 --> 11:15.537
Oh, honey, I'm no fool.

11:15.571 --> 11:18.373
You would not be giving up
client list revenue

11:18.408 --> 11:21.009
to massage a bunch
of sweaty golfers for no reason.

11:23.546 --> 11:25.814
Are you thinking
about going legit?

11:25.848 --> 11:26.915
Kyle and I are good.

11:28.183 --> 11:29.751
Real good.

11:29.786 --> 11:31.986
And I started doing this
to take care of my family.

11:32.021 --> 11:35.557
And...
If it's back together,

11:35.591 --> 11:38.627
are you thinking
about getting out?

11:39.629 --> 11:42.063
I just want
a backup plan.

11:42.097 --> 11:44.032
Well.

11:44.066 --> 11:46.735
I love
"happily ever after."

11:46.769 --> 11:49.170
I'm gonna trust you
on this one.

11:49.204 --> 11:53.708
But you have got to be
on high alert.

11:53.743 --> 11:56.344
We'll watch everyone, Georgia,
okay? You have my word.

11:56.378 --> 11:57.846
Mm-hmm.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.448
Besides, after all
we've been through,

11:59.482 --> 12:01.783
we need a little fun.

12:09.425 --> 12:10.959
What's this?

12:10.993 --> 12:12.393
I missed you.

12:12.428 --> 12:14.963
We're not really
gonna do all this, are we?

12:14.997 --> 12:15.964
Do what?

12:15.998 --> 12:18.533
Oh, you know...

12:18.568 --> 12:20.401
Couple stuff.

12:20.436 --> 12:24.773
Acting all lovey-dovey,
nicknames, PDSs,

12:24.807 --> 12:28.477
Valentine's Day flowers ...
all that crap.

12:28.511 --> 12:31.112
Do I look like
that kind of guy?

12:33.349 --> 12:35.450
No, which is good,

12:35.485 --> 12:39.420
'cause I got to be honest ...
it's not really my speed.

12:39.455 --> 12:40.856
Mine either.

12:41.958 --> 12:43.391
Mm.

12:43.425 --> 12:45.026
You want to know
what my speed is?

12:47.530 --> 12:48.997
Come here.

12:49.031 --> 12:51.600
Riley's
in the next room.

12:51.634 --> 12:54.736
Well, then, I guess
you better be very, very quiet.

12:54.770 --> 12:57.839
# You're gonna shoot me down #

12:57.874 --> 13:00.174
# You're gonna shoot, shoot #

13:00.209 --> 13:02.243
# You're gonna shoot me down #

13:02.277 --> 13:04.078
# You're gonna shoot, shoot #

13:04.113 --> 13:05.780
# You're gonna shoot me down #

13:05.815 --> 13:07.048
# Shoot me down #

13:09.318 --> 13:11.653
Kyle?

13:11.687 --> 13:13.989
Travis? Katie?

13:14.023 --> 13:15.256
Anybody?

13:15.290 --> 13:17.859
Look at me!
I'm flying!

13:17.894 --> 13:19.460
Whoo-hoo!

13:19.495 --> 13:21.129
Whoa. Who are you,
and what is that?

13:21.163 --> 13:23.999
Um, I'm just leaving,
and that is hours upon hours

13:24.033 --> 13:25.667
of parenting-free
entertainment.

13:25.701 --> 13:27.669
Yeah, okay, my husband
did not consult me about this.

13:27.703 --> 13:29.270
Uh, sorry, ma'am.
Kyle!

13:29.304 --> 13:31.706
Why is there
a giant, expensive trampoline

13:31.741 --> 13:32.941
in our backyard?

13:32.975 --> 13:34.308
Don't worry.
It's not costing anything.

13:34.343 --> 13:35.810
A friend lent it
for the weekend.

13:35.845 --> 13:37.679
I thought it'd be a good idea
tomorrow for the kids.

13:37.713 --> 13:39.014
What kids?

13:39.048 --> 13:41.049
For Travis' football team.
The sleepover.

13:41.083 --> 13:43.451
The sleepover?
I said we weren't hosting.

13:43.485 --> 13:45.486
Travis,
did you lie about that?

13:45.521 --> 13:47.822
Kinda.

13:47.857 --> 13:50.525
Okay, Travis,
go wash up for dinner.

13:52.528 --> 13:55.564
Hey. You and I are gonna
talk about this later.

13:55.598 --> 13:57.999
What the hell
were you thinking?

13:58.034 --> 13:59.534
Hey. Whoa.
No, don't "whoa" me.

13:59.569 --> 14:01.169
I've had a very long week,
and I come home,

14:01.203 --> 14:03.237
and now I got to deal
with these kids?

14:03.272 --> 14:04.973
Riley, I asked Travis about it.
He said that you approved it.

14:05.007 --> 14:07.308
I told him
I would think about it.

14:07.342 --> 14:09.310
I'm helping Harold
with his fundraiser.

14:09.344 --> 14:10.712
What a little con man.

14:11.681 --> 14:13.848
Look, it's fine. W-we'll just ...
we'll cancel it.

14:13.883 --> 14:16.751
Oh, so that I can
look like the bad guy?

14:16.786 --> 14:19.654
No, I don't think so.
You can't do that, Kyle.

14:19.689 --> 14:21.723
You can't just come in here and
start making executive decisions.

14:21.757 --> 14:22.951
Riley, it's a sleepover.

14:22.976 --> 14:24.983
I didn't tell him he could
run off and join the Army.

14:25.027 --> 14:27.261
You find this real funny.
You know what?

14:27.296 --> 14:29.197
I have been taking care
of things around here on my own

14:29.231 --> 14:31.432
and doing a damn good job.
And I know that.

14:31.467 --> 14:33.068
If I'm gonna be home,
I should have a say

14:33.069 --> 14:34.703
in the decisions that get made
around here, too.

14:34.737 --> 14:36.270
Fine, but I can still
be pissed at you

14:36.305 --> 14:37.438
for not
consulting me first.

14:37.473 --> 14:38.607
Hey. Hey.
Hey.

14:38.641 --> 14:39.608
Hello.

14:39.642 --> 14:41.409
Hey.

14:41.443 --> 14:42.844
Whoa.

14:42.878 --> 14:44.079
Uh, we'll just ...
we'll come back.

14:44.113 --> 14:45.413
No, no.
Please, please come in.

14:45.447 --> 14:46.581
Maybe you can
talk some sense into her

14:46.616 --> 14:48.083
before she sends me off

14:48.117 --> 14:49.918
to the firing squad for agreeing
to host a sleepover.

14:49.952 --> 14:51.586
You know
what would be a great idea,

14:51.621 --> 14:53.922
is if you guys could tell Kyle,
'cause he doesn't know,

14:53.956 --> 14:56.557
how hard it is to wrangle
a bunch of 8-year-olds.

14:56.592 --> 14:57.435
Okay, well, I'll tell you
what I think.

14:57.460 --> 14:58.559
No, sweetie, she doesn't want
to know what you think.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.762
You sure?
Yeah.

15:00.796 --> 15:02.697
I think that you two should just
kiss and make up. It's not a big deal.

15:02.732 --> 15:05.466
You know what? Dale and I will
help Kyle with the sleepover.

15:05.501 --> 15:07.135
Yeah. What she said.

15:07.169 --> 15:09.104
I thought you guys were getting
ready for your home visit.

15:09.138 --> 15:10.459
We just have to
install some locks

15:10.472 --> 15:11.740
and put together
some baby furniture.

15:11.774 --> 15:13.241
I mean, we should be
good to go, right?

15:13.275 --> 15:14.876
Yeah, it'll be fine.
All systems go.

15:14.910 --> 15:16.210
You know what?
I appreciate that.

15:16.245 --> 15:18.146
Very considerate.

15:18.180 --> 15:19.948
Come on, Dale.
I got the baby stuff out back.

15:19.982 --> 15:21.482
You have to see this trampoline.
Trampoline?!

15:21.517 --> 15:24.552
Okay!

15:24.586 --> 15:27.255
Whoa!
Do you remember the trampolines...

15:27.289 --> 15:28.623
So, the honeymoon's over?

15:28.658 --> 15:31.225
The honeymoon
never started.

15:31.260 --> 15:32.761
Wait ... Kyle's back,
and you two haven't...

15:32.795 --> 15:34.796
No, Lace, we haven't.

15:34.830 --> 15:36.564
Wow.
I want to.

15:36.598 --> 15:39.567
Look, we tried,
and it got all hot and heavy,

15:39.601 --> 15:41.002
and then...

15:41.037 --> 15:43.772
Ugh. I just couldn't
stop thinking about...

15:43.806 --> 15:45.740
Riley, he won't.
You know that.

15:45.775 --> 15:47.241
My head knows that.

15:47.276 --> 15:49.177
My heart has some serious
catching-up to do.

15:49.211 --> 15:52.113
Maybe it is just time
for you to let go.

15:53.282 --> 15:55.817
Just a bit.

15:55.851 --> 15:58.419
Well, I can let go.

15:58.453 --> 15:59.988
What? You don't think
I can let go?

16:00.022 --> 16:01.489
Yeah.

16:01.523 --> 16:05.093
Maybe it is just time
to give Kyle a chance, too.

16:05.127 --> 16:06.427
Who put this together?

16:06.461 --> 16:08.196
Are you kidding me?!
Yeah!

16:08.230 --> 16:09.463
Look at you!

16:09.498 --> 16:12.300
I can let go.

16:12.334 --> 16:14.102
That's the real deal.
A couple of kids on there...

16:14.136 --> 16:16.637
Best elite unit in the country,
and we're on it.

16:16.672 --> 16:17.772
Isn't it something?

16:17.807 --> 16:19.174
It's something,
all right.

16:19.208 --> 16:20.641
Hey,
it's not a surprise.

16:20.676 --> 16:22.177
I mean,
I've always excelled.

16:22.211 --> 16:24.012
In high school,
I was a natural athlete.

16:24.046 --> 16:26.881
Seriously, Trimble?
Do you not remember dodge ball?

16:26.916 --> 16:29.350
Trimble got picked last
in dodge ball.

16:29.384 --> 16:31.285
And I was
a straight-A student.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.954
Only because you sweet-talked
the valedictorian

16:32.988 --> 16:34.022
into doing
your homework.

16:34.056 --> 16:35.389
What can I say?

16:35.424 --> 16:37.291
Chicks dig me,
and so do the Texas Rangers.

16:38.694 --> 16:40.294
Show some sensitivity.

16:40.329 --> 16:42.630
What?
Shelby graduated top in our class.

16:42.664 --> 16:44.999
Evan, give it a rest.

16:46.168 --> 16:48.669
Shelby was part of that raid,
just like us.

16:48.704 --> 16:50.739
Just because she's not some
pretty boy they can use as bait

16:50.773 --> 16:52.473
doesn't mean
she should be shut out.

16:52.507 --> 16:53.875
She doesn't need you
standing up for her.

16:53.909 --> 16:55.376
She can handle herself
just fine.

16:55.410 --> 16:58.146
Actually, Evan's right,
if you think about it.

16:58.180 --> 16:59.180
It really sucks.

16:59.215 --> 17:00.681
No.
That's not happening.

17:00.716 --> 17:02.884
Trimble's not feeling
sorry for me ... ever.

17:02.918 --> 17:05.519
Yeah, Trimble.
And you ... drop it.

17:05.554 --> 17:07.222
I mean it.
Just drop it.

17:08.557 --> 17:10.657
I don't care what she says.
It's bullshit.

17:10.692 --> 17:12.861
But it's not like
you can do anything about it.

17:14.763 --> 17:17.665
Dude, really?
A sneaker?

17:17.699 --> 17:19.166
A baby
needs a sneaker?

17:19.201 --> 17:20.401
Like he's gonna wake up
one morning

17:20.435 --> 17:21.569
and just go,
"I'm going for a run."

17:21.603 --> 17:23.070
Come on.

17:23.105 --> 17:23.931
Dude, you got to
help me out here.

17:23.932 --> 17:25.733
What?
Travis is my son, too.

17:26.142 --> 17:28.576
All right, how long is she gonna
keep making me pay for the past?

17:28.610 --> 17:29.383
You've been gone a while.

17:29.408 --> 17:30.979
You can't expect to just
pick up where you left off.

17:30.980 --> 17:32.413
All right, I get that part,
but come on.

17:32.447 --> 17:34.282
It's a sleepover.
How hard could it be?

17:34.316 --> 17:35.549
That is true,
and you survived jail.

17:35.584 --> 17:37.718
That was
one hell of a sleepover,

17:37.753 --> 17:40.273
so this should be a cakewalk for you.
Great. Thank you for that.

17:40.289 --> 17:42.290
But come on. It's not like
I'll be doing it alone.

17:42.324 --> 17:44.025
You and Lacey ...
Whoa. No, no, no, no, no.

17:44.059 --> 17:45.726
You will be doing this alone.
Riley was right.

17:45.761 --> 17:47.428
You made your sleeping bag.
You're gonna lie in it.

17:47.462 --> 17:49.230
Well, hold on. I thought
you said you were on my side.

17:49.265 --> 17:50.799
You know what?

17:50.833 --> 17:52.633
Metaphorically speaking,
I'm on your side.

17:52.668 --> 17:55.203
Hey, we have
big things happening, Kyle.

17:55.237 --> 17:57.605
Lacey said that ...
Lacey is not the boss of me.

17:57.639 --> 17:59.407
I wear the pants
in this family.

17:59.441 --> 18:01.075
Come on, honey!
Be quick!

18:01.110 --> 18:03.144
Why?
Because we've got a lot to do,

18:03.179 --> 18:04.545
and I want
to get back here early

18:04.579 --> 18:06.247
to help Kyle set up
for the sleepover.

18:06.282 --> 18:07.381
All right.

18:07.416 --> 18:08.382
Chop-chop!

18:08.417 --> 18:10.285
Okay!
All right, fine.

18:12.321 --> 18:13.321
I got to go, dude.

18:13.355 --> 18:14.655
Yeah, I s... yeah.
Coming!

18:14.690 --> 18:16.991
Don't forget
to put on those pants!

18:20.095 --> 18:22.630
# Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh #

18:24.700 --> 18:26.334
# Ooh #

18:26.368 --> 18:28.602
# Been around the block
a couple of times #

18:28.637 --> 18:31.105
# That don't mean
I got to get wise #

18:31.140 --> 18:33.308
# Say I'm acting like a child #

18:33.342 --> 18:35.643
# I'm a little too wild #

18:35.677 --> 18:37.912
# Lost and found,
where is my mind? #

18:37.947 --> 18:40.081
# Searching
every glass of wine #

18:40.115 --> 18:43.651
# There ain't no sense
in cryin', no, no #

18:43.685 --> 18:46.321
# Say she crazy #

18:46.355 --> 18:48.489
# Say she got no brakes #

18:48.523 --> 18:50.959
# Oh, she want to get dirty #

18:50.993 --> 18:52.793
# She's a walking mistake #

18:52.828 --> 18:54.795
I am trying
to run a business here.

18:54.830 --> 18:57.332
You can't just show up
any time that you want.

18:57.366 --> 18:59.800
Next time you're late,
you're working the skank shift.

18:59.835 --> 19:01.402
Now get out.

19:03.805 --> 19:05.840
Ladies.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.808
I didn't think
you'd show.

19:07.843 --> 19:09.277
Well,
after the 20th call,

19:09.311 --> 19:11.212
I realized
that you weren't gonna quit.

19:11.247 --> 19:13.848
I am persistent
when something matters.

19:13.883 --> 19:15.483
Mm.

19:17.419 --> 19:19.453
I thought
you were mad at me.

19:19.488 --> 19:21.289
Oh, no.

19:21.323 --> 19:24.192
I owe you an apology
for last time.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.362
I have been under...

19:27.396 --> 19:31.532
Ss much pressure lately,
Nikki.

19:31.566 --> 19:34.568
And I had forgotten
what is important.

19:34.603 --> 19:37.872
That is, you and me.

19:39.241 --> 19:41.376
Wow.

19:41.410 --> 19:43.144
I want to take you
to dinner tonight,

19:43.178 --> 19:48.016
and then tomorrow, we will spend
all day in bed together.

19:51.053 --> 19:52.553
Mm.

19:52.587 --> 19:54.322
Tomorrow, I can't.

19:54.356 --> 19:57.058
I have school,
and then I'm at the Rub.

19:57.092 --> 19:59.193
But tonight,
I am all yours.

19:59.228 --> 20:01.362
I'll take what I can get.

20:05.301 --> 20:07.001
Nikki.

20:07.036 --> 20:09.670
You're still looking for
the client list for me, right?

20:09.704 --> 20:13.107
Of course I am, baby.

20:13.142 --> 20:15.443
Good girl.

20:15.477 --> 20:16.544
Mm.

20:37.132 --> 20:41.936
# You write the course,
and I will run #

20:44.606 --> 20:49.310
# Pushing weathered chairs
towards the sun #

20:51.680 --> 20:56.084
# And we wade through the waves
and got carried away #

20:56.118 --> 20:59.753
# To the new shores,
part the white from the grey #

20:59.788 --> 21:03.791
# You write the course,
and I will run #

21:03.825 --> 21:06.560
See?
Just like I told you.

21:06.595 --> 21:07.928
Beautiful day.
Nothing to worry about.

21:07.963 --> 21:09.630
Mm-hmm.
Are you sure about that?

21:09.664 --> 21:11.732
Harold and Evan
are just talking.

21:11.766 --> 21:13.001
There's
my favorite girl!

21:13.035 --> 21:14.135
Aah!

21:14.169 --> 21:15.269
Okay, put me down!

21:15.304 --> 21:16.837
I just couldn't
help myself.

21:16.872 --> 21:18.439
Try. Please try.

21:18.474 --> 21:21.075
Somebody's three sheets to the wind.
Mm-hmm.

21:21.110 --> 21:23.511
It's a little early
for happy hour, isn't it?

21:23.545 --> 21:25.313
Mm.
It's 5:00 somewhere.

21:25.347 --> 21:26.680
Charming.

21:26.715 --> 21:29.017
Hey, y'all.
Oh, hey. Right on time.

21:29.051 --> 21:31.452
Well, I'm here, ain't I?
That's true.

21:31.487 --> 21:33.521
Mm.
How about her?

21:33.555 --> 21:35.189
Four hands
are better than two, huh?

21:35.224 --> 21:37.091
Mr. Codd and I
need to have a little chat.

21:37.126 --> 21:38.493
Go ahead ...
take care of that business

21:38.527 --> 21:39.827
we talked about earlier.

21:39.861 --> 21:42.263
Hey! What the hell
are you thinking?!

21:42.297 --> 21:44.598
Georgia, I was ...
Don't interrupt me!

21:44.633 --> 21:46.367
Now, you are acting
like a damn fool!

21:46.402 --> 21:48.136
Do I need to remind you
of the rules?

21:48.170 --> 21:49.970
Because if I do,
then you can just

21:50.005 --> 21:51.205
kiss your membership
goodbye.

21:54.543 --> 21:55.876
Need a relaxing massage?

21:55.911 --> 21:57.645
Hell, I don't know.

21:57.679 --> 21:59.380
Oh, look.
No time to relax.

21:59.415 --> 22:01.715
Well, if you need anything...
Thanks.

22:01.750 --> 22:03.284
Speak of the devil.

22:03.318 --> 22:04.952
I was just telling Evan
how you saved the day.

22:04.986 --> 22:07.321
Oh, I don't know about that,
but we're real happy to be here.

22:07.356 --> 22:09.457
You on duty?
A bunch of us are working security.

22:09.491 --> 22:10.824
Yeah,
and we're grateful.

22:10.859 --> 22:12.626
Well, you won't hear me
complaining.

22:12.661 --> 22:14.128
It's a beautiful day
and great cause.

22:14.163 --> 22:15.829
You two
coming by the bar later?

22:15.864 --> 22:18.166
I'm sure Georgia's gonna
insist upon it.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.201
She knows
how to get her way, right?

22:20.235 --> 22:21.335
Yes, she does.
All right.

22:21.370 --> 22:23.404
I'll, uh,
I'll see you guys later.

22:23.439 --> 22:25.906
All right.

22:25.941 --> 22:27.175
Well, you look great.

22:27.209 --> 22:28.909
Thanks. So do you.

22:28.944 --> 22:31.479
No, I'm serious.
You're practically glowing.

22:31.513 --> 22:34.482
Oh, well, you know ...
new moisturizer.

22:34.516 --> 22:36.817
Things are ...
are real good.

22:36.851 --> 22:38.252
Kyle back at your place?

22:38.287 --> 22:39.920
He is.

22:39.955 --> 22:41.589
Yeah, kids
couldn't be happier.

22:41.623 --> 22:43.491
That's great.
I mean, for them.

22:43.525 --> 22:45.025
Yeah, and you and Shelby,
are you guys ...

22:45.060 --> 22:47.228
Oh, yeah, Shelby's ...
everything's really ...

22:47.262 --> 22:49.663
Evan Parks,
congratulations are in order.

22:49.698 --> 22:51.665
That's quite a promotion
you got yourself.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.867
Thank you.
Riley, this is Judge Overton.

22:53.902 --> 22:55.982
Judge Overton, this is
my sister-in-law, Riley Parks.

22:57.473 --> 22:58.439
"Riley," is it?

22:58.474 --> 23:00.674
It is. It is. Hi.

23:00.709 --> 23:01.709
Very nice meeting you.

23:02.611 --> 23:05.513
So, Evan, a promotion?
That is so exciting.

23:05.547 --> 23:06.947
Yeah. It really is.

23:06.982 --> 23:09.049
Texas Rangers green-lit
a new task force.

23:09.084 --> 23:11.419
Picked me to be part
of an elite undercover unit.

23:11.453 --> 23:14.188
Wow ... undercover.
What are you gonna be doing?

23:14.223 --> 23:16.056
Well, if I told you,
I'd have to kill you.

23:16.091 --> 23:17.391
Ohh.

23:17.426 --> 23:18.959
Let's just say
it's organized crime,

23:18.994 --> 23:20.628
and I'm gonna be in the middle
of all of it ...

23:20.662 --> 23:22.896
drugs, trafficking,
prostitution.

23:23.999 --> 23:26.300
Lot of dirty business
going on behind closed doors.

23:26.335 --> 23:28.302
Really?
Yeah.

23:28.337 --> 23:30.704
If you are breaking the law
in the great state of Texas,

23:30.739 --> 23:32.340
get ready.

23:33.642 --> 23:35.809
'Cause we're coming
for you.

23:47.646 --> 23:49.514
All right.

23:51.216 --> 23:52.583
Hey, we got this.

23:52.617 --> 23:54.352
Yeah, tonight'll be fine.
I'm just ...

23:54.386 --> 23:56.754
I'm worried about tomorrow ...
the social worker, you know?

23:56.788 --> 23:59.357
There's just a lot at stake ...
Hey. Lace, Lace, Lace, Lace, Lace.

23:59.391 --> 24:01.192
Come on.
We're Locklins.

24:01.226 --> 24:02.760
I know.
We're good, right?

24:02.794 --> 24:04.262
All right,
I think we're there.

24:04.296 --> 24:06.931
Balloons are up.
Kids should be here any minute.

24:06.965 --> 24:08.799
Have we successfully
secured the perimeter?

24:08.833 --> 24:10.268
Uh, yeah ...
we're gonna contain the kids

24:10.302 --> 24:11.869
from 1400
to 1600 hours.

24:11.903 --> 24:13.804
All right. Zone defense.
I like it. How about the food?

24:13.838 --> 24:15.229
Uh, yeah, the pizza's
gonna be delivered ...

24:15.254 --> 24:16.207
1800 hours.

24:16.208 --> 24:17.442
Good.
Okay.

24:17.476 --> 24:19.110
I think you guys
are just taking this

24:19.144 --> 24:20.211
a little bit
too serious.

24:20.245 --> 24:21.879
Can't we just say
"6:00"?

24:21.913 --> 24:22.880
No.
No.

24:22.914 --> 24:24.715
Fine.
1800 hours.

24:24.749 --> 24:26.117
There's gluten-free options
in the fridge.

24:27.152 --> 24:28.486
Right on time.
All right.

24:28.520 --> 24:29.820
Okay.
Let's do this. Put it in.

24:29.854 --> 24:31.289
Here we go. All right.
"Sleepover" on three.

24:31.323 --> 24:32.723
"Sleepover" on three.
One, two, three!

24:32.757 --> 24:34.158
Sleepover!
Sleepover! Sleepover!

24:34.193 --> 24:35.193
Whew.

24:36.361 --> 24:37.861
All right, you ready?

24:37.896 --> 24:39.530
Yeah.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.466
Let's go,
Beaumont Broncos!

24:41.500 --> 24:43.401
Hey!

24:43.435 --> 24:45.703
Come on!
Dad has a trampoline!

24:48.540 --> 24:49.507
Oh, shit.

24:49.541 --> 24:50.808
Okay.

24:50.842 --> 24:52.910
We're gonna jump
until we puke!

24:52.944 --> 24:54.878
Okay, guys.
Seri... okay.

24:54.913 --> 24:56.547
Hey! Hey! Hey!

24:56.582 --> 24:58.316
All right, you know what?
86 the zone.

24:58.350 --> 25:00.518
This is full-court press!
Full-court press!

25:00.552 --> 25:03.854
No ... hey!
No cleats on the trampoline!

25:03.888 --> 25:05.423
Just two at a time!
Two at a time!

25:05.457 --> 25:07.592
Hey!
He said "no cleats"!

25:09.428 --> 25:11.729
Evan, this task force
seems dangerous.

25:11.763 --> 25:13.831
Well, it's police work,
so anything could happen,

25:13.865 --> 25:16.033
but with this man
overseeing things,

25:16.067 --> 25:18.102
what could go wrong?

25:18.137 --> 25:19.703
"Judge Overton,"
was it?

25:19.738 --> 25:21.339
Yeah.
Yeah.

25:21.373 --> 25:23.693
You seem like a guy that doesn't
get much time for himself.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.445
How about a massage?

25:27.479 --> 25:31.249
Oh, I don't know.
I'm...feeling fine ... really.

25:31.283 --> 25:33.284
Oh, I'd take her up
on it, Judge.

25:33.318 --> 25:35.085
Riley owns her own spa.
She works magic.

25:35.120 --> 25:37.388
Might actually help you
with your stroke, too.

25:37.422 --> 25:39.723
Yeah, I might help you
with your stroke.

25:40.925 --> 25:42.860
What do you say?

25:44.630 --> 25:47.598
Well, a smart man never argues
with a beautiful woman.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.400
Aww.

25:52.604 --> 25:54.905
Lead the way,
Ms. Parks.

25:54.939 --> 25:57.875
Evan,
congratulations again.

25:57.909 --> 25:59.310
Right this way.

26:06.985 --> 26:08.952
We can try.

26:08.987 --> 26:10.655
Hi.
Can we help you?

26:10.689 --> 26:12.156
Deep tissue?
Shiatsu?

26:12.191 --> 26:14.124
Actually, I just got
my massage license.

26:14.159 --> 26:15.793
I was wondering
if you all are hiring.

26:15.827 --> 26:17.428
We're good. Mm-hmm.

26:17.462 --> 26:19.163
We could use
some fresh blood.

26:19.198 --> 26:21.399
Why don't you leave your résumé?
I'll show it to the boss.

26:21.433 --> 26:23.167
It seems like
a great place to work,

26:23.202 --> 26:26.637
especially if it's side-by-side
with that guy.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.172
Uh-huh.

26:28.207 --> 26:30.140
You have a nice day.

26:32.344 --> 26:33.844
Hmm.

26:33.878 --> 26:35.813
Have a nice day.

26:35.847 --> 26:39.083
Don't call us,
and we won't call you.

26:41.220 --> 26:42.786
You are heading up
a task force

26:42.821 --> 26:44.689
that is taking down
prostitutes?

26:44.723 --> 26:46.691
So, what is it ... you just
get off on getting me new shoes

26:46.725 --> 26:48.492
and then telling me
there's nothing to worry about?

26:48.527 --> 26:49.927
Ow. That's a little
too much pressure.

26:49.961 --> 26:51.462
Oh, good.

26:51.496 --> 26:53.531
When were you
gonna tell me, huh?

26:53.565 --> 26:56.467
When my family was watching me
on the 10:00 news in handcuffs?

26:56.501 --> 26:59.237
Ahh! Geez!
Are you trying to kill me?

27:00.171 --> 27:02.440
No, but I will
if you are setting me up.

27:02.474 --> 27:05.175
You know, I sign
all the task force warrants.

27:05.210 --> 27:07.044
Every move they make,
I'm gonna know about it.

27:07.078 --> 27:09.480
Now, you have my word ...
I've got your back.

27:09.514 --> 27:11.382
Do you have mine?

27:13.218 --> 27:14.652
I always do.

27:16.921 --> 27:19.123
You know what?
My hand has a cramp in it.

27:19.157 --> 27:21.392
I'm gonna get you
someone new.

27:21.426 --> 27:22.393
Selena!

27:26.265 --> 27:27.898
So, uh...

27:27.932 --> 27:29.133
Lot of pros here, huh?

27:29.167 --> 27:30.868
I mean golfers.

27:30.902 --> 27:32.503
One of them
just gave me his card.

27:32.537 --> 27:34.138
Like I need help
with my stroke.

27:34.172 --> 27:35.573
Hey, who's that guy
with Derek?

27:35.607 --> 27:37.174
Beats me.

27:37.208 --> 27:40.010
That's how it happened.

27:40.044 --> 27:42.546
I can't believe it.
I know. Hell of a shock.

27:42.581 --> 27:44.548
I had no idea.

27:44.583 --> 27:45.883
None of us did.

27:47.552 --> 27:49.420
So, you'll be there
tomorrow?

27:49.454 --> 27:51.054
Yeah, of course.

27:52.591 --> 27:53.557
Take it easy, man.

27:53.592 --> 27:54.558
Nice seeing you.

27:54.593 --> 27:55.593
You too.

27:59.030 --> 28:01.599
So, you're not gonna introduce
me to your new boyfriend?

28:01.633 --> 28:03.033
Yeah,
he is kind of cute.

28:03.067 --> 28:04.435
Seriously, I'm not in the mood
right now.

28:04.469 --> 28:06.270
What ... did you just have
a lovers spat?

28:06.305 --> 28:08.385
Damn it, Selena. You don't know
when to quit, do you?

28:10.776 --> 28:12.910
I need a drink.

28:15.113 --> 28:17.348
What's his problem?
I was just joking.

28:17.382 --> 28:19.550
Wake up, Selena.
He likes you. You like him.

28:19.584 --> 28:21.051
You're a couple. Why don't you
start acting like it?

28:21.085 --> 28:24.355
Yeah, guys like Derek
don't me along every day.

28:24.389 --> 28:25.690
Shit.

28:25.724 --> 28:27.124
Relationships are hard.

28:27.158 --> 28:28.693
Amen to that.

28:28.727 --> 28:29.694
Mm-hmm.

28:29.728 --> 28:30.795
Oh.

28:30.829 --> 28:32.930
Hello.
Go for Riley Parks.

28:32.964 --> 28:35.065
Hello, ma'am.
Sugar Land alarm services.

28:35.099 --> 28:37.535
The alarm at the Rub at
Sugar Land has been activated,

28:37.569 --> 28:39.637
and a unit
will be dispatched.

28:39.671 --> 28:41.605
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.407
Um...don't do that.
I'll take care of it.

28:43.442 --> 28:44.709
Thanks so much.
Have a good day.

28:44.743 --> 28:45.776
Everything okay?

28:45.811 --> 28:47.778
Yeah,
the alarm went off.

28:47.813 --> 28:48.686
Is something wrong?

28:48.711 --> 28:49.947
I-I don't know.
I'm gonna go check it out.

28:49.948 --> 28:51.582
I'm coming with you.
No, no. That's okay.

28:51.616 --> 28:53.050
I'll go with you.
You shouldn't go alone.

28:53.084 --> 28:55.285
Okay.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.744
Whoa, whoa. H-hold on.
They might still be here.

29:19.778 --> 29:21.746
No, whoever it is
is long gone.

29:21.780 --> 29:23.146
I'll get the lights.

29:23.181 --> 29:24.615
Oh, wow!

29:26.150 --> 29:27.150
Holy...

29:30.689 --> 29:33.524
They left the cash
and the jewels?

29:35.560 --> 29:37.928
What the hell
were they looking for?

29:37.962 --> 29:39.997
Makes you wonder.

29:49.145 --> 29:50.399
I'm calling the cops.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.501
No. Unh-unh.

29:52.535 --> 29:54.636
No, cops are...

29:54.670 --> 29:57.306
They're just bad for business.

29:57.340 --> 29:59.941
We'll just let them get away
with trashing the place?

29:59.976 --> 30:02.411
Well, I-it's the cost
for doing what we do.

30:04.180 --> 30:05.900
Is there anything
I should be worried about?

30:05.915 --> 30:07.516
'Cause I like
working here,

30:07.550 --> 30:08.717
but I'm not looking
for any trouble.

30:08.751 --> 30:10.018
Everything is fine,
Derek.

30:10.052 --> 30:11.853
So why don't you
just go back there

30:11.887 --> 30:13.522
and tell them
that we're all okay?

30:13.556 --> 30:16.458
'Cause the last thing I need
is a panicked Georgia.

30:16.493 --> 30:17.859
Mm.

30:22.499 --> 30:24.065
There's something
you're not telling me.

30:24.100 --> 30:25.734
It's fine.

30:27.703 --> 30:30.239
Got it under control.

30:31.941 --> 30:33.108
Okay.

30:43.085 --> 30:44.686
This is out of control!

30:44.720 --> 30:46.188
I mean, I turn around
for just a second,

30:46.222 --> 30:47.556
and look at this place.

30:47.590 --> 30:49.224
Yeah, they're
slippery little suckers.

30:50.593 --> 30:51.593
Oh, no.

30:53.763 --> 30:57.166
Hey, sweetie.
What is wrong?

30:57.200 --> 30:58.700
I want to go home.

30:58.734 --> 31:00.569
Oh, but why?
We're having such a good time.

31:00.603 --> 31:02.003
Hey. Hey, hey.
What happened?

31:02.038 --> 31:03.438
Uncle Dale.

31:05.908 --> 31:07.108
What did you do?

31:07.143 --> 31:10.245
I made it to
the candy cane forest first.

31:10.280 --> 31:13.282
These kids have to learn
how to deal with adversity.

31:13.316 --> 31:14.516
Dale.

31:14.551 --> 31:17.452
He's a baby.

31:19.055 --> 31:21.056
Selena told me
about the alarm.

31:21.090 --> 31:22.757
Is there anything
I should be worried about?

31:22.792 --> 31:24.526
The alarm's
more trouble than it's worth,

31:24.561 --> 31:25.927
but I've got it
taken care of.

31:25.961 --> 31:27.196
Mm.
That's great to hear.

31:27.230 --> 31:29.531
I was getting
a little bit nervous.

31:29.566 --> 31:31.246
You know if anything
happens to the list...

31:31.267 --> 31:32.234
Georgia.

31:32.268 --> 31:34.203
I got it.

31:34.237 --> 31:37.105
Okay?
I'm gonna take care of it.

31:47.450 --> 31:48.983
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:49.018 --> 31:50.985
Hi. Everything okay
at the Rub?

31:51.020 --> 31:52.321
Yeah, it's fine.

31:53.590 --> 31:55.123
He's lying.
You're lying.

31:55.157 --> 31:58.159
If something's wrong,
you've got to tell us.

31:59.329 --> 32:01.330
Someone trashed
Riley's office.

32:01.364 --> 32:03.131
That's all I know.
She said she has it handled.

32:03.165 --> 32:04.333
I shouldn't even
be telling you guys this.

32:04.367 --> 32:06.101
This is terrible.
I just...

32:06.135 --> 32:07.936
That's the last thing we need
right now.

32:09.706 --> 32:11.440
Oh, my God!
I got to go!

32:11.474 --> 32:13.642
I didn't realize it was so late.
I have a huge test tomorrow.

32:13.676 --> 32:14.976
On a Sunday?

32:16.379 --> 32:17.812
I meant "Monday."

32:17.847 --> 32:20.282
See y'all later.

32:20.316 --> 32:21.850
Huh.
I need a drink.

32:21.884 --> 32:23.952
Um, you know what?

32:23.986 --> 32:25.787
Derek. Wait.
Can I get a beer?

32:25.821 --> 32:28.089
About today ...
you know, you and that guy ...

32:28.124 --> 32:29.291
I just want to explain.

32:29.325 --> 32:30.759
It doesn't matter,
Selena.

32:30.793 --> 32:32.761
Look, I know
I said I like your speed...

32:32.795 --> 32:34.263
Wait ... can you just listen
for one minute?

32:34.297 --> 32:36.331
...but I want to be
more than just fun with you.

32:36.366 --> 32:39.134
And I'm not afraid
to show someone I like them.

32:40.236 --> 32:41.803
Okay.

32:41.837 --> 32:43.938
If that's what it's gonna take
for you to shut up

32:43.973 --> 32:46.141
and listen to me,
we can PDA all night long.

32:46.175 --> 32:48.009
I'm just ...

32:48.043 --> 32:49.478
I'm trying to apologize here.

32:49.512 --> 32:52.046
I was acting
like a freakin' idiot.

32:52.081 --> 32:54.349
Can't argue with that.

32:54.384 --> 32:56.151
You know, there's a reason
why I don't do this.

32:56.185 --> 32:58.887
There's a reason why I don't
let people get close.

32:58.921 --> 33:00.589
But I'm here, so...

33:02.057 --> 33:04.359
So, come on.

33:04.394 --> 33:06.561
Who was that guy
you were talking to earlier?

33:06.596 --> 33:08.897
He's in a town
for a funeral.

33:08.931 --> 33:10.565
One of the guys
from my squad, Marcus,

33:10.600 --> 33:11.866
killed himself last week.

33:13.736 --> 33:15.203
Oh.

33:15.237 --> 33:18.139
I'm sorry.
I didn't ...

33:19.542 --> 33:21.343
I knew he was having trouble
finding a job.

33:21.377 --> 33:22.477
I mean, we all were.

33:22.512 --> 33:24.245
I live 10 minutes away.

33:24.280 --> 33:26.348
You know, all he needed was a friend.
No ... hey, hey, hey.

33:26.382 --> 33:28.183
If I had called him ...
This isn't your fault.

33:28.217 --> 33:30.185
Marcus always
had my back.

33:30.219 --> 33:34.523
Once, we were out on patrol
and we got ambushed.

33:34.557 --> 33:36.257
I thought
my number was up,

33:36.292 --> 33:38.593
and then he just came
charging right in.

33:38.628 --> 33:40.094
Didn't once
think about himself.

33:40.129 --> 33:42.397
Well, he sounds like
a great guy.

33:42.432 --> 33:43.765
He was.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.767
And he knew how to have
a hell of a good time.

33:45.802 --> 33:47.502
He was always pulling me
into something.

33:47.537 --> 33:49.103
Oh, yeah?

33:49.138 --> 33:51.873
I'll bet you have
some crazy stories.

33:51.907 --> 33:54.609
You wouldn't believe them
if I told you.

33:54.644 --> 33:56.712
Look, I know
you're not interested in this.

33:56.746 --> 33:58.513
No, I am interested.

33:58.548 --> 34:02.116
Look, I want to know
all about Marcus, okay?

34:04.119 --> 34:05.253
I have all night.

34:05.287 --> 34:07.188
Come on.

34:07.223 --> 34:09.123
Come on.

34:09.158 --> 34:11.592
What was I thinking?
I mean, he's just a kid.

34:11.627 --> 34:12.893
Look, I know it sucks.

34:12.928 --> 34:14.228
Sometimes,
you have to let them win.

34:14.263 --> 34:17.197
Right. Right.
But I di... I didn't do that.

34:17.233 --> 34:18.933
I trounced on him.
He's 8 years old.

34:18.967 --> 34:20.635
I made him cry.
I'm that guy.

34:20.670 --> 34:21.902
You're not that guy.

34:21.937 --> 34:23.304
I can't do this, man.

34:23.339 --> 34:24.639
Play Candy Land?

34:24.674 --> 34:26.475
Be a dad.

34:26.509 --> 34:28.577
I mean, I can't even
supervise a sleepover.

34:28.610 --> 34:30.245
How am I gonna deal
with everything else?

34:30.279 --> 34:31.980
I'm really not ready
for this.

34:32.014 --> 34:34.382
Hold up. Are you talking about
the adoption interview?

34:34.417 --> 34:36.951
Come on.
I've seen you with my kids.

34:36.985 --> 34:38.719
No one is more ready
to be a dad than you.

34:38.755 --> 34:40.989
I promised myself
that I wouldn't be like my dad,

34:41.023 --> 34:43.658
and I don't want to disappoint
Lacey, especially right now,

34:43.693 --> 34:45.293
after everything
that she's gone through.

34:45.327 --> 34:46.762
You're gonna go in the interview
and you're gonna rock it,

34:46.795 --> 34:48.129
and you're gonna raise
an awesome kid.

34:48.163 --> 34:49.731
Okay, you're not hearing me.
I really don't ...

34:49.766 --> 34:50.998
No! No! Knock it off!

34:51.033 --> 34:53.502
No more whining.
Don't be that guy.

34:53.536 --> 34:56.804
You're Dale freakin' Locklin,
for God's sakes.

34:56.839 --> 34:58.139
I'm Dale freakin' Locklin.
Yeah, you are.

34:58.173 --> 34:59.674
Was that tough love
you just gave me?

34:59.709 --> 35:01.175
Sort of. I mean, that's kind of
what I was going for.

35:01.210 --> 35:02.444
I like it.
Was it good?

35:02.478 --> 35:03.645
It's making me feel good.
I'm glad.

35:04.847 --> 35:06.448
Ethan wants a rematch.

35:06.482 --> 35:07.482
Oh.

35:07.517 --> 35:09.418
Well.

35:09.452 --> 35:11.787
Uh...Okay. What do you say
you and me, double or nothing?

35:11.821 --> 35:14.188
You're going down,
Butthead.

35:14.223 --> 35:16.024
- Oh!
- Snap!

35:16.058 --> 35:17.959
"Butthead"?
I love this kid.

35:17.993 --> 35:19.828
All right. Fine.
Ladies first.

35:19.862 --> 35:21.262
Oh. I hope
you brought your wallet.

35:21.297 --> 35:22.297
Let's do this.

35:22.331 --> 35:23.899
I'll get it.

35:27.036 --> 35:28.503
Parks residence.

35:28.538 --> 35:31.239
Uh, yes, he is.
Just one moment.

35:32.542 --> 35:34.943
Kyle, it's your lawyer,
Graham Sandoval.

35:34.977 --> 35:37.145
Sounds serious.

35:37.179 --> 35:39.147
Hey, Graham.
What's going on?

35:48.491 --> 35:53.027
# Wolf mother, where you been? #

35:53.062 --> 35:57.332
# You look so worn, so thin #

35:57.366 --> 36:02.070
# You're a taker,
devil's maker #

36:02.104 --> 36:04.038
# Let me hear you sing #

36:04.073 --> 36:06.074
# Hey-ya, hey-ya #

36:07.777 --> 36:12.146
# Wolf father, at the door #

36:12.181 --> 36:14.816
# You don't smile anymore #

36:16.853 --> 36:20.856
# You're a drifter,
a shapeshifter #

36:20.890 --> 36:23.157
# Let me see you run #

36:23.192 --> 36:24.793
# Hey-ya, hey-ya #

36:42.819 --> 36:46.389
No!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

36:54.130 --> 36:55.498
What in the hell
did you do?!

36:55.532 --> 36:56.965
Excuse me?

36:57.000 --> 36:58.667
I told you
I would get you the list,

36:58.702 --> 37:00.736
and now you've gone
and messed things up!

37:00.771 --> 37:01.937
Riley's not stupid.

37:01.971 --> 37:03.171
No. But you are.

37:03.206 --> 37:05.474
You told me
that you were going to work.

37:05.509 --> 37:07.009
You didn't think
I would have you followed?

37:07.043 --> 37:09.177
You didn't think
I could smell the deception

37:09.212 --> 37:11.614
leaking from your pores?
No, I ...

37:11.648 --> 37:13.015
I didn't mean to ...

37:13.049 --> 37:14.349
Cops are after me.

37:14.384 --> 37:16.652
Everyone has always
been after me.

37:16.686 --> 37:18.153
Greg,
you're hurting me!

37:18.187 --> 37:20.289
You know what hurts me?
That I believed in you.

37:20.323 --> 37:22.858
That I actually thought
you were worth my time.

37:22.893 --> 37:24.627
You don't mean that.
I gave you one job,

37:24.661 --> 37:25.828
and you couldn't
get it done!

37:25.862 --> 37:27.930
Now I'm through
with you!

37:27.964 --> 37:29.665
Greg, I'm sorry.
Just ...

37:29.699 --> 37:31.266
Get out!

37:33.637 --> 37:36.004
Please.

37:36.039 --> 37:40.476
I'm begging you ...
don't do this to me.

37:40.510 --> 37:42.377
You did it to yourself.

37:43.713 --> 37:45.648
Now get out!

37:49.218 --> 37:53.622
Thank you, sir.
Appreciate it.

37:53.657 --> 37:55.658
Can I borrow you
for a second?

37:55.692 --> 37:57.526
Thank you.

37:57.561 --> 37:59.394
Your loss.

37:59.429 --> 38:01.296
What are you doing?

38:01.331 --> 38:03.499
You know it's wrong that
you're not on the task force.

38:03.533 --> 38:05.033
Did you really drag me back here
to talk about this?

38:05.068 --> 38:06.735
I just kept thinking
about how unfair it all was,

38:06.770 --> 38:08.036
and Barnes agreed.

38:08.071 --> 38:09.705
He told me
that the first training spot

38:09.739 --> 38:11.841
that opens in detectives ...
it's yours.

38:11.875 --> 38:13.476
I didn't ask you
to do that.

38:13.510 --> 38:15.043
I know you didn't,
but ...

38:15.078 --> 38:16.679
I'm not some damsel in distress
that needs rescuing.

38:16.713 --> 38:17.713
Of course you're not.

38:17.747 --> 38:19.147
I'll make detective
on my own.

38:19.182 --> 38:20.583
I know that.

38:21.585 --> 38:22.785
I should clock you.

38:32.395 --> 38:34.096
We should celebrate.

38:34.130 --> 38:36.431
Ohh...

38:36.466 --> 38:38.767
We're going to.

38:49.880 --> 38:52.114
This is Georgia.
Leave a message.

38:52.148 --> 38:53.582
Hey, Georgia.
It's Riley.

38:53.617 --> 38:55.450
Um, could you
just call me back?

38:55.485 --> 38:56.886
Please?
It doesn't matter how late.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.220
We have to talk.

39:18.174 --> 39:19.708
Hi.

39:19.743 --> 39:21.644
Go to sleep.

39:40.163 --> 39:42.665
Oh. Ow.

39:42.699 --> 39:45.267
Hey, hey, hey.
You okay?

39:45.301 --> 39:46.501
No. Not really.

39:46.536 --> 39:47.657
Riley, come here.
Let's talk.

39:50.273 --> 39:52.007
Look, I know you're
going through a hard time,

39:52.042 --> 39:53.676
but a good friend of mine
once said, "sometimes,

39:53.710 --> 39:55.310
"you got to stop thinking
and planning and worrying

39:55.344 --> 39:56.579
and just say,
'to hell with it.'"

39:56.613 --> 39:58.447
she sounds like
a great friend.

39:58.481 --> 40:00.148
Yeah, she is.
She really is.

40:01.885 --> 40:04.687
Okay. That's it.  What is going on?
Nothing, Lacey ...

40:04.721 --> 40:05.863
I'm not gonna talk
about this right now.

40:05.888 --> 40:06.889
No, I'm not leaving ...

40:06.890 --> 40:09.291
- I don't want to have this conversation.
- Mom!

40:11.294 --> 40:12.661
Mom, I can't sleep.

40:12.696 --> 40:15.764
Okay, you know what?
Let's go get you in bed.

40:15.799 --> 40:17.766
Riley, are you ...
I'm fine. Good night.

40:23.807 --> 40:29.712
# I know I've seen you
when I wake up #

40:29.746 --> 40:35.484
# A daydream recurring
that I cannot stop #

40:35.518 --> 40:37.285
He I've been
trying to call you.

40:37.320 --> 40:38.720
I'm so sorry.
My phone battery died.

40:38.722 --> 40:40.043
No. I can't even
believe it. Look.

40:40.056 --> 40:41.289
What is going on?

40:41.324 --> 40:43.492
It's done.
I'm ... I'm free of it.

40:43.526 --> 40:45.861
Vandermeyer took a plea.

40:45.895 --> 40:48.463
All right? He's going to jail.
I don't have to testify.

40:48.498 --> 40:50.298
It's over.

40:50.333 --> 40:52.300
And we can finally put
all this bad stuff behind us.

40:52.335 --> 40:54.903
Oh, my God.
Kyle, that is so great.

40:58.074 --> 40:59.842
Look.

40:59.876 --> 41:01.810
I'm ready
to move forward.

41:01.845 --> 41:03.012
All right,
I know you and I,

41:03.046 --> 41:04.379
we still got
a lot of work to do.

41:04.413 --> 41:05.714
All right, we can keep
talking about ...

41:05.749 --> 41:07.449
I don't want to talk.
I don't want to talk.

41:08.551 --> 41:09.518
Okay.

41:09.552 --> 41:12.888
# Halo over my wild one #

41:12.922 --> 41:15.991
# Over my wild one #

41:16.026 --> 41:20.562
# Forever and ever #

41:20.596 --> 41:25.534
# Halo over my wild one #

41:25.568 --> 41:29.337
# Over my wild one #

41:29.372 --> 41:33.976
# Forever and ever, forever #
