What the hell are you doing?

15:20.086 --> 15:21.046
Leave her alone.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.380
It will distract her training!

15:22.547 --> 15:24.716
All I did was ask her out to a movie.

15:28.178 --> 15:31.264
I think there's a cinema just over there.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.575
Watch it.

16:16.142 --> 16:20.480
J. Jae, that boy Mzee's

16:20.730 --> 16:22.482
Have you even spoken to her yet?

16:22.607 --> 16:25.485
No. First impressions are really important.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.821
Any advice?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.781
OK, but listen carefully.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.783
I'm only going to say this once.

16:32.283 --> 16:36.079
First, act like you're
not interested in the girl.

16:37.288 --> 16:39.499
By the way, her name's Nana.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.501
But you've never talked to her, right?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.294
You shouldn't know her name.

16:44.587 --> 16:47.507
Don't use her name,
give her a nick name instead.

16:47.799 --> 16:48.717
A nickname?

16:48.842 --> 16:50.677

Hello?

33:28.717 --> 33:30.593
It's Mr. Song. Have you found it yet?

33:30.844 --> 33:31.886
We're working on it.

33:32.137 --> 33:33.096
Let me remind you,

33:33.221 --> 33:35.682
the Zodiac Vase is one of China's
most valuable antiques.

Don't worry, when we find it
you'll be the first to know.

33:41.146 --> 33:43.648
We have put a trace on his phone.

33:44.065 --> 33:45.108

Surround the area immediately.

41:49.092 --> 41:51.720
Hold on! Looks like he's stopped.

41:52.554 --> 41:54.305
Tracker says he's right here.

41:54.431 --> 41:55.557
He should be here.

41:57.809 --> 41:59.477
He should be here.

42:04.274 --> 42:05.734
This way.

42:19.539 --> 42:21.541
Can you see me?

42:21.666 --> 42:23.877
I'm right above you...

- Hi.
- Hi, it's me.

44:42.390 --> 44:46.478
Remember we're going out
to celebrate after your meeting.

44:46.811 --> 44:47.937
Are you still up for it?

44:48.480 --> 44:51.149
Yes. I've just had to pop home
to pick up some documents.

44:51.399 --> 44:54.194
Perfect. I could come and pick you up.

44:54.319 --> 44:57.530
Thanks, but by the time you get here
I'll be back at work.

44:57.655 --> 44:59.949
OK. See you tonight then.

46:26.077 --> 46:29.706
I've seen your drone. It's cool.

46:33.960 --> 46:37.380
Yeah. I've got a better one now.

46:37.672 --> 46:41.384
She's got 3-axle stabilisation gimbal
and a high def maps database.

Hold on...

46:49.392 --> 46:51.144
Danny's in trouble.

46:51.603 --> 46:53.063
I need your help.

46:54.439 --> 46:56.441
I'll go cuff him.

46:58.401 --> 46:59.819
Wait a minute.

47:00.320 --> 47:02.030
I'll help.

47:02.447 --> 47:04.324
Great. Can I borrow your scooter?

47:04.449 --> 47:07.577
No. It's only me that drives that.

47:09.579 --> 47:11.164
That works.

47:20.006 --> 47:22.050
That cop car is still following us.

47:23.635 --> 47:25.261
Good. Let him follow.

47:27.931 --> 47:29.057
Watch out!

48:57.854 --> 48:59.981
He wants to see the money.

49:21.836 --> 49:23.338
Is he crazy?

49:32.847 --> 49:33.932
Enough!

49:55.120 --> 49:58.498
It's right behind you,
first shelf, the first one.

50:30.572 --> 50:31.740
Take the next right.

50:32.991 --> 50:34.701
Right turn, right! Right!

50:40.206 --> 50:42.625
I think you need to apologise.

50:52.177 --> 50:54.262
He started it.

50:55.096 --> 50:56.639
Boss.

51:00.352 --> 51:02.729
The vase, it's real.

51:14.199 --> 51:15.533
Let's go.

51:28.171 --> 51:29.839
Wait.

51:30.006 --> 51:35.220
My friend says
your scar looks really cool.

51:39.057 --> 51:40.100
Who gave it to you?

52:02.497 --> 52:03.873
My thumb...

52:04.165 --> 52:06.292
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

52:27.439 --> 52:29.107
Hurry up. We're nearly there.

52:44.289 --> 52:45.874
Go faster. Go faster.

53:11.524 --> 53:12.400
Damn!

53:12.567 --> 53:13.651
Calling all units!

53:53.274 --> 53:54.567
That's them!

53:56.903 --> 53:57.904
Freeze!

56:30.348 --> 56:36.312
Danny says I have to follow the vase.

56:36.688 --> 56:43.445
He always saves
the most dangerous stuff for me.

56:44.195 --> 56:48.033
So would you mind driving, Bunny?

56:48.533 --> 56:49.534
Sure.

56:49.659 --> 56:52.704
But call me Bunny again
and you can go there on foot.

59:29.069 --> 59:30.653
What are you doing?

59:30.779 --> 59:32.405
What are you doing here?

01:03:04.409 --> 01:03:06.161
Where is my tea?

01:03:06.453 --> 01:03:07.954
In your study.

01:03:13.251 --> 01:03:14.961
Miss Yen, phone call.

01:03:22.677 --> 01:03:25.680
Bring the car around I have a meeting.

01:04:28.326 --> 01:04:30.036
The gallery is full of smoke.

01:06:54.264 --> 01:06:56.141
Stop. You're those kids
from the pottery factory.

01:06:56.307 --> 01:06:57.726
Let's go!

01:06:57.934 --> 01:06:59.644
Stop!

01:07:05.442 --> 01:07:06.276
Stop!

01:07:07.277 --> 01:07:08.153
Stop!

01:07:41.311 --> 01:07:42.395
It's Song.

01:08:42.413 --> 01:08:43.790
Good night.

01:08:56.678 --> 01:08:59.973
This artist is renowned
for his subtlety and minimalism...

01:09:00.098 --> 01:09:01.933
...perfectly complementing
Ji hotel's stylish interiors.

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:03.852
If only your hotel...

01:09:05.854 --> 01:09:07.188
If only your hotel...

01:09:12.193 --> 01:09:14.571
It's a great opportunity...

01:09:19.617 --> 01:09:21.953
Please excuse me.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:27.834
Hello?

01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:41.848
It's me. Get downstairs now!

01:09:41.973 --> 01:09:43.015
We're on our way to pick you up.

01:09:43.183 --> 01:09:44.559
Get down there now!

01:10:43.993 --> 01:10:45.245
What's up?

01:10:45.412 --> 01:10:46.746
I have to wait for my uncle...

01:10:46.871 --> 01:10:48.665
...something might have happened to him.

01:10:48.873 --> 01:10:50.083
Letâ€™s wait in the car.

01:11:18.445 --> 01:11:20.989
Just do what we say,
and you won't be hurt.

01:11:21.698 --> 01:11:23.199
Give him your phone.

01:11:26.036 --> 01:11:27.037
Chuck it.

01:13:34.622 --> 01:13:36.666
Have some water.

01:13:40.795 --> 01:13:42.422
Do you know why I brought you here?

01:13:46.926 --> 01:13:47.927
Clever girl.

01:13:49.429 --> 01:13:51.639
He's very persistent.

01:13:54.768 --> 01:13:57.979
I don't understand you people
and your pursuit of love.

01:13:58.271 --> 01:14:00.523
Do you even know what love is?

01:14:01.524 --> 01:14:05.445
It's eternal and impossible to achieve.

01:14:05.862 --> 01:14:07.072
Understand?

01:14:08.239 --> 01:14:11.076
I think I can but you can't.

01:14:26.383 --> 01:14:28.385
What a pity.

01:14:30.804 --> 01:14:32.639
Let me explain.

01:14:33.556 --> 01:14:35.558
When I want something...

01:14:40.355 --> 01:14:42.357
...I will always get it.

01:14:42.524 --> 01:14:43.608
Don't.

01:14:43.858 --> 01:14:45.360
You're better than that.

01:14:48.697 --> 01:14:50.573
You feel for her.

01:14:57.288 --> 01:15:00.417
Why do men like you
always go for these useless women?

01:15:00.625 --> 01:15:02.043
You're all crazy.

01:17:34.154 --> 01:17:35.613
Bring her.

01:17:55.175 --> 01:17:58.178
Welcome back. My precious.

01:18:34.422 --> 01:18:35.757
Miss Mo...

01:18:36.299 --> 01:18:37.926
Thank you for your help.

01:18:38.259 --> 01:18:39.969
You are free to go.

01:18:41.012 --> 01:18:43.181
It's been a pleasure.

01:18:48.812 --> 01:18:50.188
Not you.

01:18:51.648 --> 01:18:53.108
You said we could go.

01:18:53.233 --> 01:18:54.401
Did I?

01:18:56.277 --> 01:18:59.280
No. I said you could go.

01:18:59.781 --> 01:19:01.282
But he did what you asked.

01:19:01.616 --> 01:19:02.784
You have the art.

01:19:58.715 --> 01:20:00.800
Miss Mo, I suggest you leave now!

01:23:24.129 --> 01:23:25.714
Leave him. Come and get the art.

01:23:35.265 --> 01:23:36.975
Get the art now!

01:24:35.033 --> 01:24:37.160
I'm happy you came back...

01:24:37.452 --> 01:24:39.371
You remembered what I told you?

01:24:39.662 --> 01:24:43.833
Loyalty is everything whether you're right...

01:24:44.417 --> 01:24:46.294
or in this case... wrong.

01:25:00.183 --> 01:25:01.559
Good night.

01:25:13.071 --> 01:25:14.698
I'm still watching you.

01:25:19.994 --> 01:25:21.204
Good to know.

01:29:04.386 --> 01:29:07.847
Or... you could call me Baby.
