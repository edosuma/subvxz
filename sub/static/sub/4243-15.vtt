<i>So here's what you missed on</i>
Glee: <i>Marley's dating Jake,</i>

00:02.342 --> 00:03.860
<i>but Ryder totally kissed her</i>
<i>out of nowhere.</i>

00:03.894 --> 00:05.455
<i>Finn kissed Emma, too,</i>
<i>and then she freaked out</i>

00:05.461 --> 00:07.111
<i>and left Will at the altar.</i>

00:07.129 --> 00:09.297
<i>Everyone felt bad, but not bad</i>
<i>enough to waste a wedding</i>

00:09.331 --> 00:10.882
<i>reception and everybody hooked</i>
<i>out, and I mean everybody.</i>

00:10.916 --> 00:12.617
<i>Now Rachel thinks she might</i>
<i>have a bun in the oven</i>

00:12.635 --> 00:13.885
<i>and Santana moved in with her</i>
<i>and Kurt and Brody lives there,</i>

00:13.919 --> 00:15.153
<i>too, except he's gone a lot</i>

00:15.187 --> 00:16.971
<i>and carries large wads of cash.</i>

00:17.006 --> 00:18.306
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:21.510 --> 00:23.328
(chuckles) Every Jack and
Jill at the Carousel Club

00:23.362 --> 00:25.063
couldn't take their peepers
off of you tonight.

00:25.081 --> 00:28.066
Oh, applesauce. Oh, honest Injun.
And who could blame them?

00:28.084 --> 00:30.368
You're the eighth Wonder of
the World, Emma Schuester.

00:30.402 --> 00:32.287
You're sunbeams and angel wings

00:32.338 --> 00:36.007
and the Taj Mahal all rolled
into one marvelous dame.

00:36.042 --> 00:38.293
And when we dance
together, why,

00:38.344 --> 00:39.544
my universe

00:39.578 --> 00:41.129
becomes topsy-turvy.

00:41.180 --> 00:43.798
Like gravity was never invented.

02:54.313 --> 02:56.431
Everybody loves movies.

02:56.482 --> 02:58.650
They don't just tell stories...
they transport us

02:58.684 --> 03:00.718
to other worlds.
They are inspirational.

03:00.736 --> 03:02.820
They provide comfort,
and they help us escape

03:02.855 --> 03:04.339
from our day-to-day anxieties.

03:04.373 --> 03:06.407
Like getting left at the altar?

03:07.526 --> 03:10.061
Too soon.
Exactly.

03:10.079 --> 03:12.230
Or in your guys' case,
studying for exams or...

03:12.248 --> 03:14.115
worrying about regionals.

03:14.166 --> 03:15.399
In any case,

03:15.417 --> 03:16.668
for this week's assignment,
I want you to pick

03:16.702 --> 03:19.237
your favorite songs
from your favorite movies.

03:19.255 --> 03:21.172
(cheers and applause)

03:21.207 --> 03:23.741
Unique knows all there is
to know about <i>The Crying Game.</i>

03:23.759 --> 03:26.010
KITTY: You don't get dibs on <i>Les Mis
</i> just because you are the poster.

03:26.045 --> 03:27.912
SAM (a la Nicolas Cage): Finally
I can do my Nicolas Cage

03:27.930 --> 03:31.415
impression. "Oh, not the bees!
No! The bees! No!"

03:31.433 --> 03:33.584
That is the worst Nicolas Cage
impression I've ever seen.

03:33.602 --> 03:34.969
Do you even know
who Nicolas Cage is?

03:35.004 --> 03:36.020
WILL: Okay, it's not
that simple, guys.

03:36.055 --> 03:38.223
This is a group competition...

03:38.257 --> 03:41.192
boys against girls
and we are doing mash-ups.

03:41.227 --> 03:43.144
Now remember,
movies are visual.

03:43.195 --> 03:45.146
So it's not just about
the singing... it's about...

03:45.197 --> 03:47.148
performance,
it's about theatricality,

03:47.199 --> 03:49.534
it's about the language
of cinema.

03:49.568 --> 03:52.436
Preach. And as I move
into production

03:52.454 --> 03:55.740
on my first micro-budget feature...
(overlapping chatter)

03:55.774 --> 03:59.777
...I'm happy to offer starring
roles to whichever team wins.

03:59.795 --> 04:01.713
No trailers, no per diem.

04:01.747 --> 04:02.747
WILL:
Great. Okay.

04:02.781 --> 04:03.915
Well, everyone split up
and start working

04:03.949 --> 04:06.217
on your song choices.
(indistinct chatter)

04:06.252 --> 04:08.169
You're making a movie?
Yeah.

04:08.220 --> 04:10.388
Hey. Can I talk
to you for a sec?

04:10.422 --> 04:12.223
Yeah.

04:12.258 --> 04:14.625
We should do <i>The Artist</i>
so we don't have to sing.

04:14.643 --> 04:16.644
(bell ringing)

04:18.981 --> 04:21.482
So, how's the case going,
Detective Shue?

04:23.269 --> 04:24.902
Her parents are
stonewalling me and...

04:24.937 --> 04:26.738
I don't have
any other leads right now.

04:26.772 --> 04:28.740
So, what else
have you been up to?

04:28.774 --> 04:30.775
Come on. I'm starting to get
worried about you, man.

04:30.809 --> 04:31.859
Finn, you can't just force

04:31.910 --> 04:33.194
someone to do something.

04:33.245 --> 04:34.912
Right now it's about
taking a step back

04:34.947 --> 04:36.948
and giving her some space.

04:36.982 --> 04:38.950
In the meantime,
I'm catching up on a lot

04:38.984 --> 04:40.318
of old movies.

04:40.336 --> 04:41.619
Really calms me down.

04:42.821 --> 04:44.789
Look...

04:44.823 --> 04:46.490
if she really wants
to be with me,

04:46.508 --> 04:47.992
then she'll come back
on her own.

04:48.010 --> 04:50.878
So, sitting around in front
of the TV is somehow supposed

04:50.929 --> 04:52.663
to make her want to come back?

04:52.681 --> 04:53.998
Of course not. I...

04:54.016 --> 04:55.633
Look, I know she's hurt,

04:55.667 --> 04:57.385
but I'm hurt, too.

04:57.436 --> 04:59.771
You are a good man, and I
really appreciate your concern,

04:59.805 --> 05:02.223
but it's time to leave it alone.
No, it's-it's not.

05:02.274 --> 05:03.775
It... It's time to take action.

05:03.809 --> 05:05.943
Come on. <i>Stand and Deliver.</i>

05:05.978 --> 05:07.979
<i>Zero Dark Thirty.</i>

05:10.349 --> 05:12.317
(sighs)

05:12.351 --> 05:14.986
(bell ringing)
I'm sorry, Finn Hudson.

05:15.020 --> 05:17.655
But even I don't know
the whereabouts of the lovely

05:17.689 --> 05:19.857
yet fragile Miss
Emma Pillsbury.

05:19.875 --> 05:23.411
But I can tell you she's cashed
in all of her vacation days.

05:23.462 --> 05:25.863
But you don't know where she went?
I have no idea, and frankly,

05:25.898 --> 05:28.466
I resent your flabby
accusation that

05:28.500 --> 05:31.252
just because I wore an exact
replica of her wedding dress

05:31.286 --> 05:34.005
and was the last person to see
her before her Broadway-themed

05:34.039 --> 05:37.291
freak-out that I have anything
to do with her being missing.

05:37.326 --> 05:39.143
I'm not accusing you
of anything.

05:39.178 --> 05:41.779
Well, I assume she's checked
into some ginger asylum

05:41.814 --> 05:43.197
somewhere now
that she's escaped

05:43.232 --> 05:46.384
from Will Schuester's
living dollhouse of the damned.

05:46.418 --> 05:49.454
Even if I were privy to that
information, even if I did know,

05:49.488 --> 05:52.990
I certainly wouldn't divulge it
to a flop sweat-smelling,

05:53.025 --> 05:55.326
fake-teen-teaching,
Army-deserting,

05:55.361 --> 05:57.395
high school-lurking,
sectionals-losing,

05:57.413 --> 05:59.397
special needs, baby-hating...

05:59.415 --> 06:01.732
Point is, Sue didn't know.
There has to be some way

06:01.750 --> 06:04.502
to reach her, Artie.
We owe Mr. Shue that.

06:04.536 --> 06:06.954
Finn, let me dispense
some Hollywood logic on you,

06:07.005 --> 06:10.508
if I may. What we have
on our hands is a lady manhunt.

06:10.542 --> 06:13.044
We need a hard-target search
of every gas station, residence,

06:13.078 --> 06:15.680
warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse,
outhouse and doghouse.

06:15.714 --> 06:18.383
- Ain't nobody got time for that. 
- Okay, then just talk to her parents.

06:18.417 --> 06:21.519
- You think?
- Pretty sure that's your only lead.

06:22.521 --> 06:24.138
Doin' a lot of the work here.

06:24.189 --> 06:25.807
(bell ringing)

06:25.858 --> 06:27.892
Guys, Brittany and I were just talking...
BRITTANY: And we agree

06:27.926 --> 06:30.094
that though we love that it's mash-up
week and that it's girls versus boys...

06:30.112 --> 06:32.146
It sucks that the guys and the
girls can't do a number together,

06:32.197 --> 06:34.198
so we were thinking, just
as a warm-up, we should do

06:34.233 --> 06:36.234
the guys versus girls
in the same number,

06:36.268 --> 06:37.985
to kick things off. And then the
girls can kick the boys' butts.

06:38.036 --> 06:38.870
BLAINE:
Uh, or vice versa.

06:38.904 --> 06:40.538
Which is my favorite
Fred Savage movie.

06:40.572 --> 06:41.739
SAM:
Well, it'd have

06:41.773 --> 06:43.875
to be the perfect movie song,
you know, like, uh...

06:43.909 --> 06:46.444
"Dream Warriors"
from <i>Nightmare on Elm Street 3.</i>

06:46.462 --> 06:48.112
Yeah, or a good song

06:48.130 --> 06:50.665
like "Let the River Run" from <i>Working Girl.
</i> MARLEY: Or...

06:50.716 --> 06:53.000
"Wind Beneath My Wings" from <i>Beaches.
</i> BLAINE: No, no, no, no.

06:53.051 --> 06:55.453
How about this...
the perfect movie song,

06:55.471 --> 06:57.455
totally iconic and
everyone loves it,

06:57.473 --> 06:59.957
a little ditty from the seminal
American college comedy...

this number wasn't

a mash-up, right?

09:10.755 --> 09:13.724
(bell ringing)

09:13.758 --> 09:17.194
SANTANA:
<i>My first real week in New York</i>

09:17.229 --> 09:19.196
<i>and I'm snowbound in Bushwick</i>

09:19.231 --> 09:21.932
<i>with a bunch</i>
<i>of musical theatre queens.</i>

09:21.950 --> 09:23.818
(imitates Mrs. Patmore): No,
you're doing it wrong, Daisy.

09:23.869 --> 09:25.653
(imitates Daisy): I can't do it
'cause I'm in love with William.

09:25.704 --> 09:27.438
I just can't.
<i>It's like Eli Roth decided</i>

09:27.456 --> 09:29.440
<i>to make a gay horror movie</i>
<i>and this is the scene</i>

09:29.458 --> 09:30.992
<i>right before</i>
<i>we all eat each other.</i>

09:31.043 --> 09:32.710
Oh, do it again, do it again.

09:32.744 --> 09:33.995
(dramatically):
Welcome...

09:34.046 --> 09:35.496
to Downton Abbey.

09:35.547 --> 09:38.215
(Kurt and Adam laughing)
So, where you from, Doctor Who?

09:38.250 --> 09:40.501
Uh, England. Do you know Essex?

09:40.552 --> 09:42.053
No. Never heard of it.

09:42.087 --> 09:43.954
Are you guys dating?
Because at Mr. Shue's bomb

09:43.972 --> 09:46.090
of a wedding, you and Blaine, like...
(quietly): Shut up,

09:46.124 --> 09:48.676
Santana. Rachel and I are
letting you live here rent-free.

09:48.727 --> 09:50.094
The least you could do is...
Where is Rachel anyways?

09:50.128 --> 09:51.962
Giving that living mannequin
a bikini wax?

09:51.980 --> 09:55.799
Uh, Brody is working and Rachel is
in the bathroom. Well, let's hope

09:55.817 --> 09:58.269
that she's embracing her inner
bulimic because let me tell you,

09:58.303 --> 10:00.605
homegirl has been looking
extremely pumpkin-like

10:00.639 --> 10:03.024
and not just 'cause of the Tan in a Can.
(door opens)

10:03.075 --> 10:04.108
Okay, that's it!

10:04.142 --> 10:05.142
You're gonna have to move out

10:05.177 --> 10:06.360
because this <i>our</i>

10:06.411 --> 10:08.279
sanctuary, and by ours,
I mean mine and Kurt's,

10:08.313 --> 10:10.114
and frankly, you make me
feel uncomfortable,

10:10.148 --> 10:11.649
and Brody says that you
make him feel uncomfortable

10:11.667 --> 10:13.584
as well. Girls, girls, retract
the claws, all right?

10:13.619 --> 10:15.486
NYADA canceled all the classes
because of the snow,

10:15.504 --> 10:19.040
so let's just cozy up to our
little movie marathon. Santana,

10:19.091 --> 10:20.324
did you go
through our DVD collection?

10:20.342 --> 10:23.294
I sure did.
Uh, <i>Knocked Up.</i> Hilarity.

10:23.328 --> 10:25.796
<i>Rosemary's Baby...</i> that's
obviously Lady Hummel's.

10:25.830 --> 10:28.599
And, uh, <i>She's Having a Baby.</i> RACHEL:
I don't want to watch any of those.

10:28.634 --> 10:29.600
KURT:
Oh, really, Rachel?

10:29.635 --> 10:30.885
Not even <i>She's Having a Baby?</i>

10:30.936 --> 10:32.053
'Cause you always cry

10:32.104 --> 10:33.721
at the end when
Elizabeth McGovern has

10:33.772 --> 10:34.939
the baby.
I'm not

10:34.973 --> 10:36.807
in the mood, okay?
I'm not in the mood.

10:36.841 --> 10:38.442
KURT:
Okay, fine.

10:38.477 --> 10:40.277
Because I have made
a selection that is perfect

10:40.312 --> 10:43.147
for being snowed-in
in New York City.

10:43.181 --> 10:44.615

14:32.558 --> 14:34.643
really bothering me right now.

14:34.694 --> 14:36.078
I didn't know you wore contacts.
Yes, Rachel,

14:36.112 --> 14:37.813
I just found out I have
a slight astigmatism.

14:37.847 --> 14:40.365
ADAM: Oh, I think I might have
some solution in my bag.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.402
No, no, I'm fine. I'll be good. Don't worry.
I would've thought that

14:43.436 --> 14:44.703
you were crying
because you and Blaine

14:44.737 --> 14:46.321
used to talk about
how this was your dream

14:46.372 --> 14:48.156
to sing this song to each other
at your wedding.

14:48.207 --> 14:49.992
Did we?

14:50.043 --> 14:51.410
Yeah. I remember you telling me

14:51.444 --> 14:52.878
that singing
this song to someone

14:52.912 --> 14:54.612
was a more intimate act
than sex.

14:54.630 --> 14:56.781
Who wants popcorn? Anyone?
SANTANA: No.

14:56.799 --> 14:58.283
Hold on. I'm sorry.
Can we pause this

14:58.301 --> 14:59.617
for a second?
Kurt, please sit down.

14:59.635 --> 15:01.169
I have something
to say, and I have

15:01.220 --> 15:04.256
tried to keep it to myself,
but I will be silent no longer.

15:04.290 --> 15:07.175
What is it? That Brody character
is a freakin' psycho.

15:07.226 --> 15:08.393
Go on.

15:08.428 --> 15:09.895
Here we go. SANTANA: Listen,

15:09.929 --> 15:11.580
when I first met him,
totally thought he was weird.

15:11.614 --> 15:13.715
He smelled all talcum-y
like a Cabbage Patch Doll.

15:13.750 --> 15:15.067
And then he said

15:15.101 --> 15:16.601
that I wasn't a real New Yorker

15:16.635 --> 15:18.687
until I had my first makeover,
and I was, like,

15:18.738 --> 15:20.272
what does that even mean?

15:20.306 --> 15:21.639
Like, who are you?

15:21.657 --> 15:23.575
Oh, come on,
Brody's a sweetheart.

15:23.609 --> 15:25.027
That's what
I told myself, you know?

15:25.078 --> 15:26.978
I said, "So what if he's
completely hairless"

15:26.996 --> 15:29.948
"and made out of plastic... I'm
gonna look past the fact that

15:29.982 --> 15:32.417
"he probably has a disgusting
porn star landing strip.

15:32.452 --> 15:33.785
"I'm gonna give Lars

15:33.819 --> 15:36.455
"and the Real Boy
one more chance." But then

15:36.489 --> 15:38.823
I found... this.

15:39.792 --> 15:41.659
$1,200 in cash.

15:41.677 --> 15:42.994
When did you find that?

15:43.012 --> 15:44.162
Last night when
I was rooting through

15:44.180 --> 15:45.630
all the pockets and drawers
in this apartment.

15:55.024 --> 15:56.274
Wait. What?

15:56.309 --> 15:57.476
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:57.510 --> 16:00.228
Santana, you went through
all of our stuff?

16:00.279 --> 16:01.679
Yeah. That's a thing I do.

16:01.697 --> 16:03.148
It's completely unacceptable.
I can't.

16:03.182 --> 16:05.567
Oh, okay. I like
how you guys pretend

16:05.618 --> 16:07.402
to be all accepting
about everything,

16:07.453 --> 16:09.121
but when your friend
suddenly shows up

16:09.155 --> 16:12.190
in your home, moves in
and goes through all your stuff,

16:12.208 --> 16:13.742
you're offended?

16:13.793 --> 16:15.527
Just because he has
a little money on him

16:15.545 --> 16:16.745
doesn't mean
that he's a psycho.

16:16.796 --> 16:17.913
That's what I thought, right?

16:17.964 --> 16:19.414
Who cares if he's
terrified of banks?

16:19.465 --> 16:21.133
'Cause if <i>I</i> were
made out of plastic,

16:21.167 --> 16:22.417
I'd be scared of a lot

16:22.468 --> 16:25.003
of things, too:
Open flames, barbecues. Then...

16:25.037 --> 16:27.939
I found... this.

16:27.974 --> 16:29.141
What is that?

16:29.175 --> 16:30.675
Is that a garage door opener?

16:30.709 --> 16:32.094
This is a pager, my friends.

16:32.145 --> 16:33.345
And there's only one type

16:33.379 --> 16:35.347
of person in this world
that carries cash

16:35.381 --> 16:36.681
<i>and</i> a pager.

16:36.715 --> 16:39.851
Your friend Brody...

Okay, so-so let me
get this straight.

16:49.362 --> 16:51.396
You brought us here because

16:51.414 --> 16:54.232
the "Stop Ginger Bullying Club"
founded by our daughter

16:54.250 --> 16:56.234
is in trouble. ARTIE:
We're leaderless.

17:05.545 --> 17:07.912

17:07.930 --> 17:09.330
Gingers smell like pennies.

17:09.365 --> 17:10.999

WOMAN:
It's true.

When Rusty's away
on one of his business trips

17:14.520 --> 17:16.753
to Ecuador and...
I'm really missing him,

17:16.771 --> 17:20.142
sometimes I shove my face
in a bowl full of loose change

17:20.193 --> 17:23.428

ARTIE:
Look, it's not about the money.

17:25.731 --> 17:27.598
It's about your daughter, Emma.

17:27.617 --> 17:28.700
We just really need

17:28.734 --> 17:30.768
our faculty sponsor
to come back.

17:30.786 --> 17:32.237
See, it's college
application time,

17:32.271 --> 17:34.105
and young
Artie Seymour Hoffman here

17:34.123 --> 17:36.024
really needs a scholarship.

17:36.058 --> 17:38.610
If I were you, I'd
forget about the hair

17:38.628 --> 17:40.445
and lead with the
wheelchair thing.

RUSTY: You don't
want Emma's advice

17:42.548 --> 17:44.499
about college...
she doesn't know anything.

17:44.550 --> 17:47.219
The kids at this school
don't seem to even think

17:47.253 --> 17:50.222
about what college they want
to go to until about a week

17:50.256 --> 17:51.673
before graduation.

17:51.724 --> 17:53.592
That's weird. You're
supposed to figure that out

17:53.626 --> 17:54.960
when you're a junior.

17:54.994 --> 17:57.846
Look, I just need her
to proofread my personal essay.

17:57.897 --> 17:59.631
All we need

17:59.649 --> 18:01.733
is an address.
We just need

18:01.767 --> 18:03.801
to know where she is.

Thank you.

18:27.927 --> 18:31.046
Or start eating each other.
Oh, no, please spare us.

18:31.097 --> 18:32.430

18:38.638 --> 18:41.389
Let's put it to a vote. Yea.
Oh, house vote. I say yea.

18:41.440 --> 18:42.607
Yea. <i>Moulin Rouge</i> it is.

18:42.642 --> 18:43.725
Well, what about Brody's vote?

18:43.776 --> 18:45.443
Or do drug dealers
not get to vote?

18:45.478 --> 18:47.312
Okay, he's not a drug dealer.

18:47.346 --> 18:49.064
Please, okay?
It's snowing outside.

18:49.115 --> 18:50.398
He's probably
just stranded somewhere.

18:50.449 --> 18:52.117

Hey, babe. Where are you?

18:59.659 --> 19:03.295
Aw, the bridges are closed...
I'm stuck at my friend's house

19:03.329 --> 19:04.963

19:06.132 --> 19:07.198

Well, it's our tribute
to the early

21:45.858 --> 21:48.359

of one Mr. Tom Cruise.

22:03.031 --> 22:04.657
I have a confession to make.

22:04.683 --> 22:06.151
For the past six months,
I've sat behind your back

22:06.185 --> 22:07.735
and in front of your face
that you're poor and fat

22:07.770 --> 22:10.339
and mousy and boring and you
dress like Zach Galifianakis.

22:10.856 --> 22:12.107
I apologize.

22:12.158 --> 22:13.724
God made me, and he's not
through with me yet.

22:13.742 --> 22:14.742
Besides, we're both

22:14.777 --> 22:15.994
dating Puckermans,
and someday we'll be

22:16.028 --> 22:17.412
sister-in-laws and
hanging out with

22:17.446 --> 22:19.164
Jews together.

22:19.198 --> 22:20.915
I totally saw that look.
What's going on?

22:23.119 --> 22:24.586
If I tell you something,

22:24.620 --> 22:26.788
do you swear not to tell anyone?

22:28.457 --> 22:30.258
Swear.

22:30.292 --> 22:32.743
Last week, Ryder kissed me.

22:32.761 --> 22:34.179
OMG.

22:34.213 --> 22:35.597
Was he any good, or did his

22:35.631 --> 22:37.265

22:37.299 --> 22:39.684
He was good, but...
I still like Jake.

22:39.718 --> 22:41.436
Say no more.
I completely get it.

22:41.470 --> 22:42.937
And you're not a slut at all

22:42.972 --> 22:44.189

22:49.395 --> 22:51.279

third act of the movie,

chases through the crowded
city streets

27:07.753 --> 27:10.521
to win his girl back,
and then he does some

27:10.556 --> 27:11.773
big romantic gesture,

27:11.807 --> 27:13.558
and the music swells,

27:13.592 --> 27:15.426
and then the crowd applauds,

27:15.444 --> 27:17.779
and their eyes well
up with tears...

27:19.648 --> 27:21.065
And then she'll take you back.

But that's <i>Vision</i> Quest,

29:51.086 --> 29:54.221
skipping rope isn't nearly
as romantic as John Cusack

29:54.256 --> 29:55.222
holding a boom box.

29:55.257 --> 29:56.474
Please, get down here

29:56.508 --> 29:58.559
so I can tell you
how much I love you,

29:58.593 --> 30:01.979
and how I'm <i>never</i>
gonna let you go.

30:04.349 --> 30:05.566
Guys.
Oh, yeah.

30:05.600 --> 30:06.767
You can take off now.

30:06.818 --> 30:08.102
Oh, can I get my...
Thanks so much.

30:08.153 --> 30:09.553
See you. Bye.
All right, great. Good job.

30:09.588 --> 30:10.771
It went well.
Good job. Thanks, guys.

30:10.822 --> 30:11.822
(sighs)

30:14.576 --> 30:15.743
(laughs)

30:15.777 --> 30:16.911
(bird caws)

30:16.945 --> 30:18.279
I'm sorry I've kept you

30:18.330 --> 30:20.397
in the dark for so long.

30:20.415 --> 30:22.533
I know that must have
been hard for you.

30:23.585 --> 30:25.586
Hard?

30:25.620 --> 30:28.839
No, losing sectionals is hard.

30:28.874 --> 30:30.257
Losing the woman
I plan on spending

30:30.292 --> 30:31.842
the rest of my life with?

30:31.877 --> 30:33.243
A-And not knowing why?

30:33.261 --> 30:35.129
It was devastating.

30:35.180 --> 30:36.630
I didn't explain because I'm...

30:36.682 --> 30:39.633
I'm not even sure
I understand it yet myself.

30:39.685 --> 30:41.102
(sighs)

30:41.136 --> 30:43.304
I-If you were to write
yourself a pamphlet,

30:43.355 --> 30:45.639
what would it be called?

30:46.775 --> 30:48.442
Seriously.

30:48.477 --> 30:51.612
Um...

30:51.646 --> 30:54.482
"So You're Freaking Out
Because the Man You're.

30:54.533 --> 30:56.450
"About to Marry Parades
Back into Town,

30:56.485 --> 30:59.620
and You Don't Feel Like
You Know Him Anymore."

30:59.654 --> 31:03.040
Is that really
what this is all about?

31:05.077 --> 31:06.944
(sighs)

31:06.962 --> 31:08.612
Why couldn't you just come talk

31:08.630 --> 31:10.664
to me about it? What was
I supposed to say, Will?

31:10.716 --> 31:11.882
"I... let's postpone
the wedding,

31:11.917 --> 31:13.050
"let's send everybody home,

"let's get to know each other

31:14.419 --> 31:16.137
"all over again?" I...
I would have preferred that

31:16.171 --> 31:18.639
to standing at the altar alone
with everyone staring at me.

31:18.673 --> 31:19.790
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

31:19.808 --> 31:21.475
I didn't take two
seconds to think.

31:21.510 --> 31:23.511
I just... I just ran.

31:23.562 --> 31:26.063
(sighs)

31:30.018 --> 31:32.937
So, what happens now?

31:35.657 --> 31:37.024
(sighs)

31:37.075 --> 31:39.143
I don't know.

31:39.161 --> 31:41.112
I think we need
to start from scratch.

31:43.832 --> 31:45.616
Maybe with a movie
on Friday night?

31:47.502 --> 31:49.537
See if we can get to know
each other

31:49.588 --> 31:51.372
all over again.

31:53.759 --> 31:55.626
I think that would be nice.

32:03.518 --> 32:05.770
(Will sighs)

32:18.840 --> 32:21.142
Okay, New York
may be disgusting,

32:21.176 --> 32:23.194
especially when it's
covered in gray, nasty snow,

32:23.228 --> 32:25.980
and the people
may be horrible and rude,

32:26.014 --> 32:27.949
and some smelly homeless man

32:27.983 --> 32:29.984
in pee-stained tighty-whities

32:30.018 --> 32:31.619
might have groped me
on the subway,

32:31.654 --> 32:33.154
and <i>then</i> asked me for a dollar,

32:33.188 --> 32:34.822
but I gots to say,

32:34.856 --> 32:36.691
I finally feel like

32:36.709 --> 32:38.626
I have found my people.

32:38.661 --> 32:40.828
Glad that you found
your corner of the sky, Santana.

32:40.862 --> 32:42.330
Where are the Hardy Boys?

32:42.364 --> 32:43.498
Investigating the mystery of.

32:43.532 --> 32:44.999
"God, Could You Be
Any More Annoying?"

32:45.033 --> 32:46.167
Kurt and Adam are at NYADA.

32:46.201 --> 32:47.218
And Pablo Escobar?

32:47.252 --> 32:48.636
Did he ever come home?

32:48.671 --> 32:50.037
Brody is in the shower.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.172
Where he will be

32:51.206 --> 32:53.541
for the next hour,
scrubbing the drug shame

32:53.559 --> 32:55.176
off of his frictionless body.

32:55.210 --> 32:58.479
For the hundredth time, okay, if you
keep making fun of Brody... I'm not.

32:58.514 --> 33:00.565
I mean, I am. Just, not now.

33:01.717 --> 33:03.884
Okay, look,
now that we're alone,

33:03.902 --> 33:05.486
I want to talk to you

33:05.521 --> 33:07.855
about what I found
in your bathroom trash can,

33:07.889 --> 33:09.741
<i>underneath</i>
<i>the wadded-up tissue paper,</i>

33:09.775 --> 33:11.576
<i>the used cotton swabs</i>
<i>and the soiled acne wipes.</i>

33:11.610 --> 33:13.244
<i>An item which,</i>

33:13.278 --> 33:15.863
<i>unless Lady's Hummel's actually</i>
<i>been a lady all these years,</i>

33:15.897 --> 33:17.532
could have only be yours.

33:17.566 --> 33:20.685
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:20.719 --> 33:24.455
Rachel... you're really not
gonna tell me about the stick?

33:25.541 --> 33:28.343
You had no right.

33:28.377 --> 33:30.345
Rachel,

33:30.379 --> 33:32.213
I'm your friend,
you can trust me.

33:32.247 --> 33:33.848
Just tell me what's going on.

33:33.882 --> 33:35.883
(crying)

33:37.586 --> 33:39.887
Oh, God.

33:39.921 --> 33:41.889
You're gonna be okay. It's okay.

33:41.923 --> 33:43.924
(crying)

33:44.926 --> 33:46.894
It's gonna be okay.

33:46.928 --> 33:48.929
(crying)

33:50.566 --> 33:51.899
(school bell ringing)

33:51.933 --> 33:53.368
Hey.

33:53.402 --> 33:54.902
What's going on in here?

33:54.936 --> 33:56.571
You wanted to see me?

33:56.605 --> 33:59.574
Uh, yes. I wanted to talk to you

33:59.608 --> 34:01.959
about what happened
on Valentine's Day.

34:01.994 --> 34:04.295
(sighs) I lied.

34:04.329 --> 34:06.798
I didn't come up with
all that romantic stuff.

34:06.832 --> 34:09.050
Ryder did.
I-I didn't mean to lie.

34:09.083 --> 34:12.487
It's just that all this trust
and monogamy... it's new for me.

34:12.521 --> 34:15.422
I'm into it.
I just...

34:15.456 --> 34:17.425
I got nervous.

34:17.458 --> 34:20.094
I was trying to impress you.

34:20.128 --> 34:22.263
(laughs) So,

34:22.297 --> 34:25.483
I came up with this on my own.

34:25.516 --> 34:28.936
This is not what I think it is.
Oh, yes, it is.

34:28.969 --> 34:30.154
(laughs)

34:30.188 --> 34:31.606
Come here, sit down.

34:31.639 --> 34:33.241

37:20.909 --> 37:24.478
But I didn't care because
it was so sweet that you tried.

37:26.031 --> 37:27.915
Ryder kissed me.

37:30.702 --> 37:32.820
And I let him.

38:05.677 --> 38:09.013

And the winner is...

38:12.351 --> 38:14.051
everyone.

38:14.069 --> 38:15.820
What?
Why do you always do this?

38:15.854 --> 38:17.321
That's insane.
This is a sham.

38:17.356 --> 38:19.557
(overlapping chatter,
Brittany grunts loudly)

38:19.575 --> 38:21.776
Why don't you just send Maria
Shriver in to give us all hugs?

38:21.827 --> 38:23.327
In reality, what you're saying
is, we're all losers.

38:23.362 --> 38:25.279
Why did we bother having a
competition in the first place?

38:25.330 --> 38:27.115
Calm down, y'all.
Calm down.

38:27.166 --> 38:29.834
After exhaustive storyboarding
and pre-production,

38:29.868 --> 38:30.901
I realized that I needed a lot

38:30.919 --> 38:32.954
of talented bodies
to make this film great.

38:33.005 --> 38:35.239
So, choosing one winner
was just simply impossible.

38:35.257 --> 38:36.624
That is exactly right.

38:36.675 --> 38:38.509
Uh, Finn, can I talk to you
in the hallway for a sec?

38:38.544 --> 38:39.677
Ooh! ARTIE: Yeah.

38:39.711 --> 38:40.878
Everybody's gonna in it.

38:40.912 --> 38:42.180
So, who's the lead?
Who's gonna be the lead?

38:42.214 --> 38:43.347
ARTIE: There is no lead...
There's no lead.

38:43.382 --> 38:44.549
Yeah, 'cause there's no point.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.184
(overlapping chatter)

38:46.218 --> 38:48.186
No. You guys are awesome
together. I mean...

38:48.220 --> 38:49.470
We're gonna be the leads.

38:49.521 --> 38:50.638
Yay!
Yay!

38:50.689 --> 38:53.257
(overlapping chatter)

38:53.275 --> 38:55.526
Boy meets girl, boy loses girl.

38:55.561 --> 38:57.528
Boy mopes around
and sits on his ass

38:57.563 --> 38:59.564
until his best man
helps save the day.

38:59.598 --> 39:01.599
Thank you.

39:01.617 --> 39:04.652
Yeah, I-I... I mean, you would
have done the same thing for me.

39:04.703 --> 39:07.371
You have, like,
probably a thousand times.

39:07.406 --> 39:10.608
So, uh, you and Miss Pillsbury
talked it all out?

39:10.626 --> 39:12.376
Yeah. I mean,
I actually think

39:12.411 --> 39:14.045
all this craziness
was for the best.

39:14.079 --> 39:15.779
I mean, I actually think

39:15.797 --> 39:17.948
it's going to make our
relationship stronger.

39:17.966 --> 39:19.950
She say anything about me?

39:19.968 --> 39:22.003
No. Why would she?

39:22.054 --> 39:24.055
Because I kissed her.

39:26.141 --> 39:28.059
Well, she...

39:28.093 --> 39:30.928
she was freaking out about the
wedding, and going all AC/DC,

39:30.962 --> 39:33.731
and I-I tried to calm her down.

39:33.765 --> 39:35.900
And then I just... I kissed her.

39:35.934 --> 39:37.068
But I didn't mean to

39:37.102 --> 39:38.903
because I don't even
think of her like that.

39:38.937 --> 39:41.355
I swear.

39:41.406 --> 39:43.357
And I tried to tell you,
but I couldn't,

39:43.408 --> 39:45.693
because I knew
that it would ruin

39:45.744 --> 39:48.863
everything, and it's all
my fault, so just...

39:48.914 --> 39:51.532
just go ahead
and just-just punch me,

39:51.583 --> 39:54.151
or whatever,
because I deserve it.

39:58.290 --> 40:01.425
I'm so sorry.

40:17.809 --> 40:20.111
(sighs heavily)

40:21.813 --> 40:25.066
(school bell ringing)
