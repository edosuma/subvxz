WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:03.803
-GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
-I love you.

00:03.836 --> 00:07.041
The only chance
you had with me
was when I was unconscious.

00:07.075 --> 00:08.942
DAWN:
Buffy. No.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.580
No!

00:12.612 --> 00:14.182
XANDER:
We're talking
about raising the dead.

00:14.214 --> 00:15.882
-It feels wrong.
-It is wrong.

00:15.916 --> 00:19.187
She could be trapped.
I'm not gonna leave her there.

00:19.219 --> 00:21.554
WILLOW: Osiris,
 master of all fate.

00:21.588 --> 00:22.789
Let her cross over.

00:25.559 --> 00:26.760
(gasping)

00:28.928 --> 00:30.364
WILLOW:
Buffy?

00:30.397 --> 00:31.731
What's wrong with her?

00:31.765 --> 00:33.334
WILLOW:
She's in shock.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.735
-ANYA: Who are they?
-SPIKE: Road pirates.
They raid towns.

00:35.768 --> 00:37.036
Use 'em up, burn 'em down.

00:42.576 --> 00:46.246
You're alive.
And you're home.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.981
You're home.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.685
She's at home.
She has to be.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.954
We just need to get there,
and she'll be there.
This is the fastest way?

00:54.987 --> 00:57.057
-Absolutely.
-You sure?

00:57.091 --> 00:59.058
Hey, I've done a lot of fleeing
on these mean streets.
I know all the shortcuts.

00:59.093 --> 01:01.429
I don't like this.
Look, fire.

01:01.462 --> 01:05.099
Fire's rarely a sign
of imminent safety.
I wish we were there already.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.301
Hey, hey,
don't worry, ladies.
I'll get us there just fine.

01:07.334 --> 01:09.703
My senses are
primed for danger.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.673
Nothing is gonna--
(yelling)

01:18.346 --> 01:20.313
It's okay.

01:20.347 --> 01:21.914
Four-- Four limbs.

01:21.948 --> 01:25.585
At least the demons
almost hit you on their
way o of town.

01:25.618 --> 01:29.156
Yeah, now that their leader's
gone, they seem to be
making with the big skedaddle.

01:31.625 --> 01:35.396
It-It was Buffy, right?
We-We saw her,
and it was really Buffy?

01:35.429 --> 01:38.899
I think
we screwed it up.
She's broken.

01:38.932 --> 01:43.903
No. She's not broken.
She's just disoriented

01:43.936 --> 01:47.240
from being tormented
in some hell dimension--

01:47.275 --> 01:49.343
probably tortured,

01:49.377 --> 01:53.246
and it's like we don't even know
how much time has passed
there for her.

01:53.281 --> 01:55.448
Uh, possibly years.

01:55.483 --> 01:58.485
It's not something
you just get over.

01:58.519 --> 02:02.121
Oh, my God. What if
she never gets over it?

02:02.156 --> 02:05.259
-And you think of this now?
-What were you thinking,
Willow?

02:05.293 --> 02:07.427
That-That she's--
That she's not right...

02:07.460 --> 02:09.697
or-- or maybe,
like, dangerous?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.967
Home. See?

02:14.001 --> 02:16.537
You're back home.

02:16.569 --> 02:19.340
DAWN: We're all okay now.

02:25.913 --> 02:26.913
(theme music playing)

03:20.600 --> 03:22.569
Ow.

03:27.074 --> 03:29.742
It's different.

03:29.776 --> 03:31.412
A little.

03:31.444 --> 03:33.079
Willow and Tara
live here now,

03:33.112 --> 03:35.582
and, um, we--

03:35.615 --> 03:37.718
We-- We didn't do much.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.020
We moved some
of the chairs

03:40.052 --> 03:42.656
and took out some of
the little tables, but--

03:50.397 --> 03:53.199
This is the same.
Except the computer stuff.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.804
That's Willow's,
obviously.

03:56.836 --> 03:58.338
We eat at
the other end--

04:00.106 --> 04:02.008
obviously.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.091
There you are.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.629
I knew you were under
that dirt somewhere.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.007
You remember what
Mom used to say?

04:34.040 --> 04:36.677
"Either wash that neck
or plant potatoes."

04:40.348 --> 04:42.882
Yeah, I never thought
it was funny either.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.355
You want to button
that or, um--

04:50.891 --> 04:53.526
Oh. Ow.

04:55.862 --> 04:59.932
Um, we'll take
care of that after--

04:59.966 --> 05:02.134
Okay.

05:02.168 --> 05:05.004
Here, I'll do
the shirt,

05:05.038 --> 05:07.375
and then we'll
do your hands.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.043
See how nice
you look?

05:27.427 --> 05:29.362
Mom's room.

05:30.697 --> 05:34.000
I know. It's really
different now.

05:34.033 --> 05:36.002
Willow and Tara.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.672
This is their room?

05:38.706 --> 05:42.141
Yeah, well,
it seemed to make
the most sense.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.812
No one was using it,
and it's the biggest.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.079
But, you know, now
that you're here,

05:47.113 --> 05:49.081
we'll have to figure out
something to do.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.720
Buffy,

05:53.920 --> 05:56.689
you wanna, like, stop?

05:58.925 --> 06:00.894
We can--

06:00.927 --> 06:02.396
We can sit down
and talk.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.064
What else
is different?

06:07.033 --> 06:09.269
Do-Do you mean
about the house, or--

06:12.105 --> 06:14.742
Um, let's see.

06:14.774 --> 06:17.377
Giles--

06:17.411 --> 06:20.079
It's so weird.
He-He left today.

06:21.247 --> 06:23.516
Because you were--

06:23.550 --> 06:25.853
He-He'll come right back.
I'll call him.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.920
Someone'll call him.

06:27.954 --> 06:30.122
What--

06:30.156 --> 06:32.259
What what?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.928
Uh,

06:35.963 --> 06:39.098
what, um,
will you say to him?

06:39.132 --> 06:41.735
(front door opens,
footsteps approach)
What was that?

06:41.769 --> 06:44.370
It's okay. It's okay.

06:44.403 --> 06:47.540
SPIKE:
Dawn! Dawn, are you there?

06:47.574 --> 06:50.911
It's-- It's just Spike.
I'm-- I'm here!

06:54.413 --> 06:57.451
Thank God.
You scared me
half to death.

06:57.485 --> 07:00.887
-Or more to death.
You-- I could kill you.
-Spike--

07:00.920 --> 07:03.156
I mean it. I could
rip your head off

07:03.189 --> 07:05.257
one-handed and drink
from your brain stem.

07:07.860 --> 07:10.329
-Look.
-Yeah?

07:10.362 --> 07:13.867
I've seen the bloody bot
before. Didn't think
she'd patch up so--

07:18.105 --> 07:20.106
DAWN:
(softly) Yeah.

07:20.139 --> 07:22.009
She's kind of, um--

07:23.543 --> 07:25.646
She's been
through a lot...

07:25.678 --> 07:29.315
with the... death.

07:29.348 --> 07:31.519
But I think
she's okay.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.826
Spike, are you okay?

07:40.060 --> 07:41.829
I'm--

07:43.463 --> 07:45.499
What did you do?

07:45.533 --> 07:49.369
Me? Nothing.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.942
Her hands.

07:55.975 --> 08:00.312
Um, I was
gonna fix 'em.

08:00.346 --> 08:02.149
I don't know
how they got
like that.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.651
I do.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.954
Clawed her way out of
a coffin, that's how.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.855
Isn't that right?

08:11.091 --> 08:13.160
Yeah.

08:13.192 --> 08:15.295
That's what I had to do.

08:15.327 --> 08:17.865
I've done it myself.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.172
Um, we'll
take care of you.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.173
Come here.

08:27.206 --> 08:30.543
Get some stuff.
Um, Mercurochrome,
bandages.

08:30.577 --> 08:32.510
Okay.

08:44.924 --> 08:47.094
How long
was I gone?

08:49.129 --> 08:51.331
147 days, yesterday.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.366
Uh, 148 today.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.971
Except today
doesn't count, does it?

09:01.474 --> 09:03.610
How long was it for you,

09:03.644 --> 09:05.544
where you were?

09:07.379 --> 09:09.316
Longer.

09:10.482 --> 09:12.586
I got the stuff.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.221
-Is she here?
-She's here!

09:14.254 --> 09:15.956
-You're here.
-XANDER: We didn't know
where you were.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.291
-ANYA: You ran away.
-Buffy! Are you okay?

09:19.491 --> 09:20.961
You knew she was back?

09:22.229 --> 09:24.463
How did you know?

09:24.496 --> 09:25.932
-ANYA: You're not
a zombie, are you?
-XANDER: Anya!

09:25.966 --> 09:27.366
-WILLOW:
Are you in pain?
-XANDER: What do you remember?

09:27.399 --> 09:28.601
What do you know
about what happened?

09:28.635 --> 09:32.438
Hey, back off.
You did this.

09:32.471 --> 09:36.275
-What did you do?
-A spell. We-- We did a spell.

09:36.308 --> 09:38.645
-We didn't think
it worked, but--
-Is she going to be okay?

09:38.678 --> 09:39.913
I'm okay.

09:40.947 --> 09:43.650
I'm gonna be fine.

09:43.683 --> 09:47.153
I-- I remember.
You brought me back.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.756
-What was it like?
 -I-- I can't--

09:49.789 --> 09:52.625
It's okay.
You don't have to
talk about this, Buff.

09:52.659 --> 09:57.264
Hey, do you want something?
Anything. Pizza!
I'll get you pizza.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.399
-Buffy likes pizza.
-TARA: Yeah, something to eat?

09:59.432 --> 10:01.100
She doesn't want pizza.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.937
TARA:
I just meant--
Guys... back off.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.643
Right. Uh, Dawn's right.
We-- We should just be quiet

10:09.677 --> 10:11.678
and let Buffy tell us
what she needs.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.519
I-- I think I just
want to go to sleep.

10:20.552 --> 10:22.855
That's a good idea.
You-- You should sleep.

10:22.889 --> 10:27.460
Right. Long day.
But, Buffy, be happy.

10:27.494 --> 10:30.529
We got you out.
We really did it.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.201
Tired.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.937
Well, yeah.
I mean,

10:36.970 --> 10:41.008
jet lag from hell
has gotta be, you know,
jet lag from hell.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.211
My room is still--

10:45.245 --> 10:48.380
Yeah. Yes,
it's your room.

10:59.525 --> 11:02.394
Well, she-- she's
fine, normal.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.596
She used to go to bed
all the time.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.706
I think
Willow's wrong.

11:13.740 --> 11:16.643
I don't think
she's particularly
normal at all.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.912
Well, she just got back.
Give it time.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.380
I bet in a week,
she'll be our little
Bufferin again.

11:21.413 --> 11:23.850
Oh, yes. Six or seven days--
that's all you
really need

11:23.884 --> 11:25.753
to get over eternal
hell experiences.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.822
Who's that? Spike?

11:28.855 --> 11:31.191
What are you
doing out here?

11:31.224 --> 11:34.260
I hope you're not
gonna start your
little obsession

11:34.293 --> 11:36.929
now that she's
around again.

11:36.963 --> 11:39.032
-Aah!
-Hey!

11:39.066 --> 11:41.334
You didn't tell me.
You brought her
back,

11:41.368 --> 11:43.669
and you didn't
tell me.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.072
Well, now you know.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.908
I worked beside you
all summer.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.942
We didn't tell you.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.379
It was just--

11:53.413 --> 11:55.615
We didn't, okay?

11:55.648 --> 11:58.717
Listen.
I figured it out.

12:00.452 --> 12:03.090
Maybe you haven't,
but I have.

12:03.123 --> 12:05.091
Willow knew
there was a chance

12:05.125 --> 12:08.095
that she'd
come back wrong.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.730
So wrong
that you'd have--

12:10.764 --> 12:12.899
that she would
have to get rid of
what came back,

12:12.932 --> 12:15.869
and I wouldn't
let her.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.538
Any part of that
was Buffy,
I wouldn't let her.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.706
And that's why
she shut me out.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.743
What are you talking about?
Willow wouldn't do that.

12:23.777 --> 12:27.279
Ohh, is that right?

12:27.313 --> 12:31.418
Look, you're
just covering.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.385
Don't tell me
you're not happy.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.388
Look me in the eyes...

12:35.422 --> 12:37.924
and tell me
when you saw Buffy alive

12:37.957 --> 12:41.461
that wasn't the happiest moment
of your entire existence.

12:49.836 --> 12:52.272
That's the thing about magic--

12:52.304 --> 12:54.841
There's always
consequences.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.909
Always!

12:56.943 --> 13:00.179
(motorcycle engine starts)

13:05.952 --> 13:08.120
(door closes)

13:13.159 --> 13:16.296
Hey.
Did you get through
to London?

13:16.328 --> 13:18.498
Yeah. He's
gonna head back

13:18.530 --> 13:20.767
as soon as he can.

13:20.799 --> 13:23.169
I'm not sure-- like,
maybe a couple days.

13:25.538 --> 13:29.341
-How did he take it?
-Um, I'm not sure.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.443
I mean,

13:31.477 --> 13:33.379
glad, but kind
of weirded out,

13:33.413 --> 13:35.849
which I get,
you know.

13:35.883 --> 13:38.350
Lots of
"Dear Lords."

13:38.384 --> 13:40.921
And I think
I actually heard him
clean his glasses.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.393
Are you worried?

13:46.426 --> 13:50.129
Worried? Tara,
it worked fine.
It's all good.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.865
Hey, Wil, this is me.

13:53.365 --> 13:56.635
It doesn't all have to be
"good" and "fine."

13:56.668 --> 13:59.206
This is the room where
you don't have to be brave.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.375
And I still love you.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.576
If you're worried,
you can be worried.

14:06.578 --> 14:10.283
Well, I'm not
un-worried.

14:11.583 --> 14:14.386
I mean, what--
what happened--

14:14.421 --> 14:17.090
that was intense.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.960
I mean, that's...
gotta change you.

14:21.928 --> 14:24.663
When Angel came back,

14:24.697 --> 14:28.335
Buffy said
he was wild,

14:28.368 --> 14:31.171
like an animal.

14:31.203 --> 14:34.040
Buffy's not like that.

14:34.073 --> 14:36.509
-Yeah.
-But?

14:36.543 --> 14:40.212
It's just kind of
noisy up here
tonight, you know?

14:40.246 --> 14:41.480
Yeah?

14:44.451 --> 14:46.753
Is this better?

14:46.786 --> 14:51.658
Yeah. I think
it makes things
quieter in here.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.697
You know what I think?

14:57.730 --> 15:01.433
I think we all just
assumed crash positions.

15:01.467 --> 15:05.938
-Huh?
-It-- It's like,

15:05.972 --> 15:09.609
we were all tensed up,
like...

15:09.642 --> 15:11.744
we were expecting it
to screw up.

15:11.778 --> 15:15.481
And we weren't prepared
for it to actually go right.

15:16.682 --> 15:18.650
Yeah.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.923
-Tara?
-Yeah?

15:27.961 --> 15:31.230
If things
did go right,

15:31.264 --> 15:35.134
wouldn't you think
she'd be...

15:35.168 --> 15:37.470
happier?

15:37.504 --> 15:41.008
Like-- Like,
wouldn't you think

15:41.040 --> 15:43.809
she'd be so happy that
we brought her out?

15:45.044 --> 15:46.980
Sure, she is.

15:51.783 --> 15:55.422
You thought
she'd say thanks,

15:55.455 --> 15:57.389
be more grateful.

15:59.993 --> 16:03.163
Would I be
a terrible person
if I said yes?

16:04.496 --> 16:08.500
Give her time.
She'll get there.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.636
Right.

16:10.669 --> 16:13.806
No need to be in
a big, furry hurry.

16:15.207 --> 16:16.643
Exactly.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.812
TARA:
I'm sure it's okay.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.964
(glass shattering)

17:14.534 --> 17:16.669
WILLOW:
Buffy?
What did you do?

17:16.702 --> 17:19.704
Do you know what you did?
You're like children.

17:19.739 --> 17:23.375
Your hands smell of death.
Bitches!

17:23.410 --> 17:26.712
Filthy little bitches
rattling the bones!

17:26.746 --> 17:31.084
Did you cut the throat?
Did you pat its head?

17:31.117 --> 17:34.421
(girls gasping)
The blood dried
on your hands, didn't it?

17:34.453 --> 17:38.891
-Oh, my God, oh, my God.
-You were stained.
You still are!

17:38.924 --> 17:41.327
I know what you did!

17:46.499 --> 17:50.403
The glass--
There's no glass.

18:05.484 --> 18:09.055
Okay, what in the frilly
heck is going on?
Maybe we dreamed it.

18:09.087 --> 18:11.223
Right, right.

18:11.258 --> 18:14.126
Wrong.
Different brains.
Oh, yeah.

18:17.663 --> 18:21.968
Well, what was it
talking about?
Did you understand it?

18:22.000 --> 18:25.238
Well, I understood
the words, but... no.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.474
(gasping)

18:28.508 --> 18:32.278
-What was that?
-Th-There's something
in the house.

18:32.311 --> 18:36.316
What is it after?
Is it... Buffy?

18:36.348 --> 18:39.519
I don't know.
That's it.
I'm gonna call.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.153
I hope Xander's up.

18:41.188 --> 18:43.256
Xander, are you up?

18:43.289 --> 18:45.157
I can't sleep.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.828
Play a word game
with me.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.766
Xander,
are you awake?

18:53.799 --> 18:55.701
Okay, I'm gonna
describe an adjective

18:55.734 --> 18:57.970
with accurate
but misleading clues,

18:58.003 --> 19:01.441
and then you have to
guess what it is.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.643
-Xander? Xander?
-(phone ringing)

19:03.675 --> 19:06.045
Huh? What? Do what?

19:06.077 --> 19:08.079
That ought to do it.

19:11.351 --> 19:14.221
Hello?
Xander, it's me--
Willow.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.888
Uh, we were
just attacked.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.625
Attacked? A vampire?

19:19.659 --> 19:23.195
No, it-it was Buffy,
or something that
looked like her.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.731
-TARA: Like she was possessed.
-And then she just disappeared,

19:25.765 --> 19:27.900
a-and-- and we saw
something-- a little--

19:27.933 --> 19:30.737
There's something
in the house.

19:30.769 --> 19:33.373
In the house?
All right, Willow,
you need to get out of there.

19:33.405 --> 19:35.875
-Just get everyone out.
-(chuckling evilly)

19:35.907 --> 19:40.011
Wake up Buffy and Dawn.
Don't make a big deal--
Ah!

19:43.450 --> 19:46.519
Anya! Anya!

19:46.552 --> 19:49.388
WILLOW:
Xander?

19:49.422 --> 19:51.423
Xander!

19:53.292 --> 19:57.864
Very bad. Very, very,
very bad. Bad.

19:57.896 --> 20:00.833
He's all
traumatized.
Well, whatever it is,

20:00.866 --> 20:03.336
it's not the--
the traditional haunting,

20:03.369 --> 20:06.506
because it-- it's not limited
to one specific place...

20:06.538 --> 20:09.541
and there's not,
you know, a dead person.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.109
Not anymore.

20:11.143 --> 20:15.281
I bet it's
a hitchhiker.
A hitchhiker?

20:15.315 --> 20:18.285
Um, standard way
to travel
through dimensions.

20:18.317 --> 20:21.019
Some demon thing
sees someone moving
between worlds

20:21.053 --> 20:23.021
and grabs on
for the ride.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.090
You mean, like,
some hell beastie

20:25.124 --> 20:27.259
rode in with Buffy?

20:27.294 --> 20:29.961
Like, we're
responsible for this?

20:29.996 --> 20:32.131
Assume crash positions.

20:32.163 --> 20:34.800
I think
we shouldn't have
brought Buffy back.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.470
I knew it was gonna
end badly. I should've
said something.

20:37.503 --> 20:39.605
Okay, fine, but
what are we gonna do?

20:39.638 --> 20:42.074
I mean, I'm feeling the need
for some vigorous doing,
you know?

20:42.107 --> 20:45.811
It's okay. We-- We just
kill the beastie,
and all is good.

20:45.845 --> 20:49.648
We're rolling in puppies.
Right?

20:49.682 --> 20:53.319
Can we do that?
Kill it?

20:53.353 --> 20:56.055
-BUFFY:
We killing something?
-Buffy!

20:56.087 --> 20:57.990
You're not supposed
to be up.

20:58.023 --> 21:00.393
H-How are feeling?
Are you okay?

21:00.426 --> 21:02.494
So what are we killing?

21:02.528 --> 21:04.463
A demon
you brought back
from hell with you.

21:06.298 --> 21:09.469
-Oh.
-It's not like
she's making it sound.

21:09.501 --> 21:12.404
A little
haunting-type stuff.
Boo-scary.

21:12.439 --> 21:15.541
-Everything's normal.
-You-You shouldn't
worry about it.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.479
Um, I remembered something.

21:19.511 --> 21:22.048
Last night, uh--

21:25.484 --> 21:26.752
Buff?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.788
Uh,

21:28.820 --> 21:32.358
the photographs...
of-of us.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.960
They changed.

21:33.992 --> 21:35.694
How did they change?

21:35.728 --> 21:38.197
They were dead.

21:38.230 --> 21:41.800
I-- I mean, we were dead,

21:41.834 --> 21:45.304
like, um, dead bodies.

21:45.337 --> 21:47.874
But-- But then
they were okay,

21:47.906 --> 21:50.442
so I just, you know,
figured it was me.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.845
I-I was going crazy.

21:52.878 --> 21:55.682
Well, maybe
you are going crazy,
from hell.

21:57.249 --> 21:58.984
No, you're fine.

22:01.053 --> 22:04.790
You are, and, Buffy,
we're-- we're so glad.

22:04.824 --> 22:08.326
Yeah, this thing,
this haunting thing--

22:08.361 --> 22:10.529
We'll fix it, and then
we'll still have you back,

22:10.563 --> 22:12.131
which is...

22:12.163 --> 22:14.534
it's so important.

22:14.567 --> 22:17.202
-Yes.
-It's wonderful.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.807
We should get to work.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.542
What's the list?

22:23.576 --> 22:26.011
Possible
hitchhikers.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.515
Demons that might've
come out of hell
the same time Buffy did.

22:30.016 --> 22:33.251
"Skaggmore demons,
Trellbane demons,
Skitterers,

22:33.285 --> 22:36.087
large and small
bone-eaters."

22:36.122 --> 22:38.490
If we get to pick,
I say we go with
the small bone-eaters.

22:38.525 --> 22:41.461
Well, that just means
they prefer to eat things
with small bones, like you.

22:42.795 --> 22:45.096
That's just
what we have so far--

22:45.131 --> 22:49.201
five species of demons
that have been known
to move transdimensionally.

22:49.234 --> 22:52.572
Two of them may be invisible
in this dimension,

22:52.605 --> 22:56.542
and two others
can perform spells
to alter perception.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.911
Well, that's four.
What's the other one like?

22:58.944 --> 23:01.247
Like the others,
only dripping
with viscous fluid.

23:01.279 --> 23:03.750
Ew!

23:03.782 --> 23:06.085
So, should we concentrate
on how to kill those,

23:06.117 --> 23:07.953
or should we try
to find more?

23:07.987 --> 23:11.022
I'm not sure.
Maybe--

23:11.057 --> 23:13.460
Maybe some of us
can keep going
finding more,

23:13.492 --> 23:15.862
-and the others--
-I miss Giles.

23:15.894 --> 23:20.365
Oh, he's coming back.
I-I talked to him.

23:20.398 --> 23:22.769
I know I'm a kind of
poor substitute,

23:22.801 --> 23:25.336
but until then,
we'll get it done.

23:29.275 --> 23:31.510
I think I should patrol.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.582
Oh, I know we'll find
something soon.

23:36.982 --> 23:38.951
Yeah.

23:41.019 --> 23:44.256
XANDER: Do you want us
to go with you?
ANYA: We can do that.

23:44.289 --> 23:48.894
No, I--I need to go.
Sorry.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.797
You should go.

23:50.829 --> 23:53.065
I'll be safe here
with the others.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.000
Don't worry
about me.

24:17.824 --> 24:21.093
I found one of those
24-hour places for coffee.

24:21.126 --> 24:24.096
Remember that bookstore?
Well, they became
one of those...

24:24.130 --> 24:27.165
books and coffee places,
and now they're just coffee.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.801
It's like evolution,
only without
the "getting better" part.

24:29.836 --> 24:35.007
Uh, coffee, coffee, coffee.
Um, hot chocolate for Dawn.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.844
-You're too young for coffee.
-(Demonic voice) Idiot!

24:39.679 --> 24:43.281
-You can have my coffee.
-All of you did it.

24:43.315 --> 24:47.153
You stupid children.
Did you think the blood
wouldn't reach you?

24:47.185 --> 24:51.758
I smell the death on you.
Look at what you've done!

24:56.162 --> 24:58.497
-Fire, fire, fire!
-Dawn!

24:59.699 --> 25:01.267
XANDER:
Fire!

25:02.401 --> 25:04.069
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.977
That was it.
Like-- Like Buffy with fire.

25:11.009 --> 25:14.212
-Is she okay?
-Did I look like that?

25:14.246 --> 25:16.082
I hope I didn't
look like that.

25:16.115 --> 25:19.885
No, I'm sure you looked
really glamorous,
cutting up your face.

25:19.919 --> 25:22.555
What-- What is it?

25:22.588 --> 25:24.691
-What's happening?
-You'll be okay.

25:24.723 --> 25:28.160
-I bet you'll experience
some dry mouth.
-Huh?

25:28.193 --> 25:30.229
With fire.

25:30.261 --> 25:34.333
W-Was it--
Did the demon thing have me?

25:34.365 --> 25:36.769
It's okay.
It's okay.

25:36.802 --> 25:39.838
Yeah, it's gone.
Yes, but where
did it go?

25:39.872 --> 25:43.576
I mean,
evil things have plans.
They have things to do.

25:58.057 --> 26:01.426
(laughing hysterically)

26:01.460 --> 26:03.762
-(door opens)
-(footsteps)

26:26.117 --> 26:28.086
Buffy.

26:32.357 --> 26:34.559
You should
be careful.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.462
You never know what
kind of villain's got
a knife at your back.

26:37.496 --> 26:39.932
Your hand is hurt.

26:39.965 --> 26:42.669
Hmm.

26:42.701 --> 26:44.502
Same to you.

26:46.972 --> 26:48.974
Right.

27:01.887 --> 27:04.856
Willow's getting
pretty strong, isn't she?

27:04.891 --> 27:07.159
Bringing you back.

27:07.192 --> 27:09.560
It's hard to get a good night's
death around her.

27:11.462 --> 27:13.900
You can sit down.
I got furniture.

27:15.835 --> 27:19.404
You should see
the downstairs too.
It's quite posh.

27:36.322 --> 27:39.391
Uh, I do remember
what I said.

27:41.693 --> 27:44.496
The promise...

27:44.529 --> 27:46.432
to protect her.

27:49.101 --> 27:51.670
If I'd have done that,

27:51.703 --> 27:54.240
even if I didn't make it...

27:54.272 --> 27:57.175
you wouldn't
have had to jump.

28:03.182 --> 28:07.053
But I want you to know
I did save you.

28:07.086 --> 28:10.056
Not when it counted,
of course,
but after that.

28:12.624 --> 28:16.162
Every night after that.

28:16.194 --> 28:20.066
I'd see it all again.
I do something different.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.903
Faster, more clever,
you know?

28:26.739 --> 28:29.040
Dozens of times,
lots of different ways.

28:32.111 --> 28:34.079
Every night, I save you.

28:40.787 --> 28:45.391
It's getting light out.
Buffy's probably on her way
home from patrolling.

28:45.423 --> 28:47.794
I like sunrise better
when I'm getting up early

28:47.826 --> 28:50.229
than when I'm staying up
late, you know?

28:50.261 --> 28:52.898
It's like I'm seeing it
from the wrong side.

28:56.602 --> 28:59.070
Hey, Tara,
this is probably crazy,

28:59.105 --> 29:02.808
but Spike got me
to thinking.

29:02.842 --> 29:05.778
This spell we did--
It's having
consequences, isn't it?

29:05.811 --> 29:10.082
I mean, it sure
seems like it.

29:10.115 --> 29:13.885
I was just wondering,
did you know that this
might happen?

29:13.920 --> 29:15.086
No.

29:15.121 --> 29:19.490
Do you think--
Could someone have known?

29:19.525 --> 29:22.594
Willow is a talented witch,
and she would never
do anything to hurt anyone.

29:22.627 --> 29:26.664
I know, I know, huh?
Backing up quickly.
Hands in the air.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.938
I just meant that--
WILLOW:
Thaumogenesis.

29:31.971 --> 29:35.273
-She's possessed.
-Thaumogenesis.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.643
Yeah, right.

29:37.675 --> 29:41.948
I'm not possessed.
I-I think I figured it out.

29:41.980 --> 29:44.182
This demon--
I-It's not a demon we let out.

29:44.215 --> 29:46.785
It's-- It's a demon
that we made.

29:46.818 --> 29:50.455
We made a demon?
Bad us.

29:50.489 --> 29:54.926
Thaumogenesis is when
doing a spell actually
creates a being.

29:54.961 --> 29:58.529
In this case,
it was like a--
a-a side effect, I guess.

29:58.564 --> 29:59.965
Like a price.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.799
What?

30:02.969 --> 30:04.369
Think of it like

30:04.403 --> 30:07.173
the world doesn't like you
getting something for free,

30:07.205 --> 30:09.674
and we asked for
this huge gift-- Buffy.

30:09.708 --> 30:12.044
And-And so the world
said, "Fine,

30:12.077 --> 30:15.013
but if you have that,
you have to take this too."

30:15.047 --> 30:17.383
And it made the demon.

30:17.415 --> 30:20.886
Well, technically,
that's not a price.
That's a gift with purchase.

30:20.920 --> 30:24.856
Um-- But i-if we
made the demon,
how come we can't see it?

30:24.891 --> 30:27.526
I mean, all we see
is us doing stuff.

30:27.558 --> 30:30.695
Well, I think it's out of phase
with this dimension.

30:30.729 --> 30:32.830
Like, i-its consciousness
is here,

30:32.865 --> 30:37.970
but its body is caught
in the ether between
existing and not existing.

30:38.003 --> 30:40.572
It doesn't have a body,
so it's borrowing ours.

30:40.605 --> 30:42.508
It borrowed Dawn
and Anya.

30:42.540 --> 30:46.811
Or it's manifesting copies
of them, like it did
when Buffy came at us.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.847
It's using them to do
stuff-- to scare us,
attack us.

30:49.882 --> 30:52.050
So we need to
un-create it, right?

30:52.084 --> 30:54.353
We need to send it
the rest of the way
out of our world.

30:54.385 --> 30:58.223
Uh-huh, except that
it's linked to the spell,

30:58.257 --> 31:00.726
so if we sent it away,

31:00.759 --> 31:03.328
it would be like
the spell didn't exist,

31:03.362 --> 31:05.364
like it never happened.

31:06.464 --> 31:08.834
Like it never
brought Buffy back.

31:08.866 --> 31:11.537
Yes.

31:11.569 --> 31:15.007
You can't do that.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.843
You can't think for
a second that you're
going to do that.

31:17.875 --> 31:21.413
TARA: Dawn--
If you think you can
give her back to me...

31:21.446 --> 31:25.351
and then take her
away again, no.

31:25.384 --> 31:28.186
That's worse than if you
never brought her back.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.957
You can't mess with
people's lives this way.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.857
Dawn, we're not
gonna do it that way.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.193
How can you
let her do this?

31:35.227 --> 31:37.563
How can you even talk
about letting her go?

31:37.596 --> 31:40.731
Honey, you weren't
listening. She said
we will find another way.

31:40.766 --> 31:43.469
-We will.
-Then do it.

31:43.501 --> 31:46.637
Wait. Okay, wait.
Dawn, everybody, hold on.

31:46.672 --> 31:51.042
What? Why are you smiling?
That's inappropriate.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.612
-Because it's temporary.
-What is?

31:53.644 --> 31:56.481
The demon.
It's gonna dissipate.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.884
The only way for it
to survive on this plane

31:58.916 --> 32:02.087
is if it were
to kill the subject
of the original spell.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.888
It would live
if it killed Buffy?

32:03.922 --> 32:05.856
But that's
not gonna happen.
Thanks for the tip.

32:45.631 --> 32:48.967
DEMON:
You don't belong here.

33:14.759 --> 33:17.063
Did they tell you
you belonged here?

33:18.896 --> 33:20.898
Did they say
this was your home again?

33:27.573 --> 33:31.643
Were you offered pretty lies,
little girl?

33:31.676 --> 33:35.980
Or did they even
give you a choice?

33:36.013 --> 33:38.916
Xander, drive faster.

33:38.950 --> 33:42.753
I can't.
I could drive faster,
and I can't drive.

33:42.788 --> 33:46.657
She's right. You're like
a snail-- a snail who's
driving a car very slowly.

33:46.692 --> 33:50.261
Come on, give it the lead foot.
We gotta help Buffy with
that demon you sent after her.

33:50.296 --> 33:53.598
I did not send the demon.
I was possessed.

33:53.632 --> 33:56.102
The demon used me to eavesdrop
on our conversation.

33:56.134 --> 33:59.371
Great. So now what?
We have to talk in some sort
of anti-demon secret code?

33:59.404 --> 34:02.941
Ood-gay idea-yay,
An-yay.

34:02.973 --> 34:07.278
Stop talking to her
in pig Latin and drive.
Buffy's in trouble.

34:07.378 --> 34:09.715
It's okay, Dawnie.
Willow and Tara
are doing a spell.

34:09.748 --> 34:12.884
Y-You sure it won't
send Buffy back?

34:12.918 --> 34:15.085
No, of course not.
It's just that she can't
fight this thing

34:15.121 --> 34:17.889
if it's all misty,
so they'll make it
more solid

34:17.922 --> 34:20.391
so Buffy can kick
its fully embodied ass.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.695
Sure it'll work?

34:23.728 --> 34:27.032
TOGETHER:
Child of words,
hear thy makers.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.900
Child of words, we entreat.

34:29.934 --> 34:32.637
With our actions
did we make thee.

34:32.670 --> 34:35.806
To our voices
wilt thou bend.

34:47.619 --> 34:50.556
With our potions,
thou took motive.

34:50.588 --> 34:53.458
With our motions
came to pass.

34:53.492 --> 34:56.594
We rescind
no past devotions.

34:56.628 --> 34:59.898
Give thee substance,
give thee mass.

34:59.931 --> 35:03.168
DEMON:
You're the one
who's barely here,

35:03.202 --> 35:05.271
set on this earth
like a bubble.

35:11.108 --> 35:13.778
You won't even disturb
the air when you go.

35:16.782 --> 35:19.150
Go. Take Dawn
out of here.

35:19.184 --> 35:22.621
Child of words,
hear thy makers.

35:22.653 --> 35:25.623
Child of words,
we entreat.

35:31.197 --> 35:32.630
Solid.

35:47.545 --> 35:48.980
-Oh!
-Ah! Ahh.

35:49.014 --> 35:50.081
Oh.

35:52.318 --> 35:55.987
That's probably the sort
of thing I'm not
supposed to see, right?

36:08.934 --> 36:11.101
-Dawn.
-What's wrong?

36:15.106 --> 36:17.074
Lunch.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.411
You made me lunch?

36:21.413 --> 36:24.382
Wow. Thanks.

36:24.416 --> 36:28.653
You better go. You've been
out of school since...

36:28.686 --> 36:30.489
I got back.

36:30.521 --> 36:32.423
And you know
what they say--

36:32.458 --> 36:35.327
Those of us
who fail history--

36:35.360 --> 36:37.762
doomed to repeat it
in summer school.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.469
Thank you.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.340
You okay?

36:49.375 --> 36:52.710
I'm going to start charging
money for every person
that asks me that.

36:52.744 --> 36:56.347
-Everyone's
been doing that, huh?
-A little bit.

36:56.382 --> 36:59.784
It's because they care
about you a lot.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.286
When you were gone--

37:02.653 --> 37:05.222
It was bad
when you were gone.

37:05.257 --> 37:08.994
But it'll be better now,
now that they can
see you being happy.

37:11.329 --> 37:12.498
It's all they want.

37:22.740 --> 37:24.775
(door opens)

37:24.809 --> 37:27.112
Buffy, hey.

37:27.144 --> 37:29.481
Hey, you get Dawn
off to school all right?
'Cause I was thinking,

37:29.514 --> 37:31.317
if you need help
picking her up, I--

37:31.349 --> 37:33.652
It's okay. I got it.

37:34.786 --> 37:38.623
Look, you guys, um,
there's this thing.

37:38.657 --> 37:41.360
So I'm just
gonna say it.

37:42.860 --> 37:45.463
You brought me back.

37:45.496 --> 37:50.936
I was in a--
I was in hell.

37:50.969 --> 37:55.940
I, um, I can't
think too much
about what it was like,

37:55.974 --> 38:00.911
but it felt like the world
abandoned me there.

38:00.945 --> 38:05.250
And then suddenly,
you guys did what you did.

38:05.282 --> 38:07.952
It was Willow.
She knew what to do.

38:09.487 --> 38:11.856
Okay, so you did that.

38:13.625 --> 38:16.827
And the world
came rushing back.

38:16.862 --> 38:19.597
Thank you.

38:19.630 --> 38:22.199
You guys gave me
the world.

38:22.233 --> 38:25.036
I can't tell you
what it means to me.

38:28.172 --> 38:30.307
And I should've
said it before.

38:31.809 --> 38:34.346
You're welcome.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.585
Welcome home, Buffy.

38:52.329 --> 38:54.164
Buffy.

38:55.701 --> 38:59.405
Spike, it's daylight,
and you're--
Not on fire?

38:59.438 --> 39:02.641
The sun's low enough.
It's shady enough here.

39:02.673 --> 39:05.210
I was gonna go inside,
but I overheard you
and the Super Friends

39:05.242 --> 39:09.014
exchanging a special moment,
and I came over a bit queasy.

39:10.748 --> 39:14.619
Say, aren't you leaving
a hole in the middle
of some soggy group hug?

39:16.286 --> 39:18.523
Just wanted
a little time alone.

39:20.291 --> 39:23.061
Oh. Uh, right, then.

39:29.534 --> 39:33.505
It's okay. I can be alone
with you here.

39:33.539 --> 39:36.106
Thanks ever so.

39:36.141 --> 39:38.076
Right.

39:41.311 --> 39:42.748
Buff?

39:43.815 --> 39:45.751
Slayer?

39:47.117 --> 39:48.954
Are you okay?

39:50.621 --> 39:52.958
I'm here. I'm good.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.568
Buffy, if you're in--

40:03.601 --> 40:06.237
if you're in pain,

40:06.271 --> 40:10.608
or if you need anything,
or if I can do
anything for you--

40:10.641 --> 40:12.277
You can't.

40:15.012 --> 40:17.615
Well, I haven't been to
a hell dimension just of late,

40:17.648 --> 40:20.552
but I do know a thing or two
about torment.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.454
I was happy.

40:25.623 --> 40:27.958
Wherever I was,

40:30.161 --> 40:32.130
I was happy.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.132
At peace.

40:37.202 --> 40:40.105
I knew that everyone
I cared about was all right.

40:41.873 --> 40:43.809
I knew it.

40:45.777 --> 40:49.146
Time didn't mean anything.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.617
Nothing had form.

40:52.650 --> 40:54.885
But I was still me,
you know?

40:57.722 --> 40:59.490
And I was warm.

41:00.858 --> 41:02.628
And I was loved.

41:04.829 --> 41:06.632
And I was finished.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.068
Complete.

41:12.336 --> 41:15.039
I-I don't understand

41:15.072 --> 41:18.677
theology or dimensions--

41:18.710 --> 41:20.579
any of it, really.

41:22.413 --> 41:24.815
But I think I was in heaven.

41:29.554 --> 41:31.590
And now I'm not.

41:34.760 --> 41:37.896
I was torn out of there.

41:37.929 --> 41:41.398
Pulled out... by my friends.

41:43.668 --> 41:48.373
Everything here is hard...

41:48.405 --> 41:50.576
and bright...

41:50.608 --> 41:52.210
and violent.

41:55.045 --> 41:57.148
Everything I feel,

41:57.181 --> 41:59.016
everything I touch--

42:00.518 --> 42:02.420
this is hell.

42:05.556 --> 42:09.894
Just getting through
the next moment...

42:09.927 --> 42:12.362
and the one after that,

42:13.231 --> 42:15.567
knowing what I've lost--

42:31.583 --> 42:34.219
They can never know.

42:34.251 --> 42:36.121
Never.

43:14.659 --> 43:16.460
Grr! Arrgh!
