11:07.245 --> 11:10.045
Of course, and, you know, I get that.
I even told Sandy about it.

11:10.285 --> 11:11.365
Who's Sandy?

11:11.565 --> 11:14.325
The new girl. I didn't want her thinking
this place was a madhouse.

11:14.725 --> 11:16.285
I had to say something.

11:16.925 --> 11:19.485
Look, I just need a bit of professionalism
around here, okay, Tony.

11:19.565 --> 11:20.485
-Please?
-No.

11:20.565 --> 11:22.125
I shouldn't have to explain this to you.

11:22.205 --> 11:24.045
You can't just go around
being rude to people.

11:24.125 --> 11:24.965
You can, though.

11:25.365 --> 11:26.605
That's the beauty of it.

11:27.045 --> 11:29.885
There's no advantage
to being nice and thoughtful

11:29.965 --> 11:32.005

11:32.085 --> 11:33.925
It's a <i>disadvantage,</i> if anything.

11:34.005 --> 11:36.645

I might have to let you go.

11:36.725 --> 11:37.605
No, you won't.

11:38.085 --> 11:40.645
You won't, that's what I'm saying,
'cause you're a nice bloke.

11:40.725 --> 11:44.045
So I'll take advantage of you,
like everyone else does here.

11:44.125 --> 11:45.805
-You'll warn me. I'll ignore it.
-What?

11:45.885 --> 11:47.725
You'll give me another warning.
I'll ignore it.

11:47.805 --> 11:49.445
I'll carry on doing what the fuck I want.

11:49.525 --> 11:51.885
Eventually, you'll give up, and I'll win.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.445

11:54.525 --> 11:57.485
that you won't even question
"women's problems."

11:57.565 --> 11:59.405
Kath's had three periods this month.

11:59.485 --> 12:01.685
She likes Fridays off. You do nothing.

12:01.765 --> 12:04.165
She gets away with it
'cause she's an arsehole.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.685
So, I thought, right,
let's have a bit of that.

12:06.765 --> 12:07.845
Why would you wanna do that?

12:07.925 --> 12:10.205
Why wouldn't you just rather
get better and be happy?

12:10.285 --> 12:12.365
There's only one thing
that'd make me better and happy,

12:12.445 --> 12:14.965
and that's Lisa being around,
and that can't happen.

12:15.045 --> 12:17.805
So that's why I nearly killed myself
straight away.

12:17.885 --> 12:20.485
Right, okay, but you didn't
kill yourself, did you?

12:20.845 --> 12:23.685
So, clearly, you know,
something made you stop.

12:23.765 --> 12:25.125
The look on the dog's face.

12:25.845 --> 12:28.085
She was hungry,
so I thought I'd better feed her.

12:28.405 --> 12:29.845
It gave me time to think,

12:29.925 --> 12:31.165
"I should be dead now."

12:31.245 --> 12:32.165
I didn't care.

12:32.325 --> 12:33.685
So, everything's a bonus.

12:34.685 --> 12:36.205
If I become an arsehole,

12:36.285 --> 12:39.005
and I do and say what the fuck I want

12:39.085 --> 12:40.445
for as long as I want,

12:40.525 --> 12:42.045
and then when it all gets too much,

12:42.125 --> 12:43.445
I can always kill myself.

12:43.805 --> 12:44.965
It's like a superpower.

12:45.205 --> 12:47.605
That's the worst superhero
I've ever heard of.

12:48.405 --> 12:49.685
That's the way it is now.

12:49.765 --> 12:50.845
[Braden] So what? So...

12:50.925 --> 12:51.805
[sighs]

12:52.245 --> 12:55.845
My job now is to make you happy
<i>before</i> you kill yourself?

12:55.925 --> 12:58.605
That's like a constant ticking clock
for me now, is it?

12:58.685 --> 12:59.725
If you like.

12:59.805 --> 13:01.085
Well, I don't like.

13:01.165 --> 13:03.205
Anyway, that's the way it is.

13:03.645 --> 13:05.565
[Braden] Okay, well,
I'm glad we had this chat.

13:05.645 --> 13:07.085
[Tony] Yeah, very constructive.

13:08.725 --> 13:09.845
All right, um...

13:10.645 --> 13:12.645
So this is... This is Sandy.

13:12.725 --> 13:16.165
She's just started today.
It's her first day, um, so, Tony,

13:16.245 --> 13:18.125
she's gonna be working under you.
If you could...

13:18.205 --> 13:20.085
show her the ropes, tell her what's what.

13:21.645 --> 13:23.325
Here's what's what. Um...

13:23.725 --> 13:25.165
humanity is a plague.

13:25.405 --> 13:29.165
We're a disgusting, narcissistic,
selfish parasite,

13:29.445 --> 13:31.525
and the world would be
a better place without us.

13:31.605 --> 13:33.805
It should be everyone's moral duty
to kill themselves.

13:33.885 --> 13:36.445
I could do it now.
Quite happily just go upstairs,

13:36.685 --> 13:37.765
jump off the roof,

13:37.845 --> 13:40.325
and make sure I landed
on some cunt from Accounts.

13:41.005 --> 13:43.965
That the sort of thing... you meant?

13:44.685 --> 13:45.685
No.

13:46.605 --> 13:47.965
Just, um... ignore that.

13:48.045 --> 13:50.765
Um, Lenny, can you show Sandy the ropes?

13:50.845 --> 13:51.845
Sure thing.

13:51.925 --> 13:53.725
[Braden] Gotta get the papers out.
Thank you.

13:53.805 --> 13:56.045
-[Tony] You showing her the ropes?
-[Lenny] Big-time.

13:56.165 --> 13:57.405
Can I guess the bullet points?

13:59.125 --> 14:00.005
Get in.

14:00.685 --> 14:02.045
Eat in front of the computer.

14:02.285 --> 14:04.485
Go to the pub.
Eat in front of the quiz machine.

14:04.885 --> 14:05.725
Go home.

14:05.805 --> 14:07.125
Eat in front of the telly.

14:07.445 --> 14:09.205
Go to bed. I assume you eat in bed?

14:09.605 --> 14:11.565
I have emergency snacks nearby, yeah.

14:15.805 --> 14:17.245
[sighs] I've gotta go.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.045
Want me to bring you
more doughnuts, fat boy?

14:20.125 --> 14:21.125
Yes, please.

14:26.125 --> 14:28.205
Do you mind him talking to you like that?

14:28.525 --> 14:29.485
Nah, he's a mate.

14:30.005 --> 14:31.205
It distracts him.

14:32.445 --> 14:34.845
You don't take any shit off him,
all right?

14:35.205 --> 14:37.805
I don't, 'cause I'm not weak like him.

14:38.445 --> 14:39.925
-[Braden] Er, Julian?
-[Julian] Yeah.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.765
[Braden] Um, we've had a couple of calls
from people

14:41.845 --> 14:44.405
saying that their building didn't get
any papers delivered.

14:44.485 --> 14:45.525
[Julian] Ah.

14:45.605 --> 14:47.765
Okay, look, that's weird
'cause I definitely

14:47.845 --> 14:48.965
delivered them all.

14:49.765 --> 14:52.965
You know you've got to ring a buzzer
to get into the actual building?

14:53.045 --> 14:54.365
You can't leave them outside.

14:54.445 --> 14:57.045
A lot of the old people can't get
up and down the stairs or go out.

14:57.285 --> 15:00.405
Yeah, I know that, boss.
I will be extra careful with these.

15:01.765 --> 15:02.605
Okay.

15:03.445 --> 15:05.525
[clears throat] Um, can I get paid now?

15:08.885 --> 15:10.325
You will do a good job, won't you?

15:10.405 --> 15:11.845
You can trust me, yeah.

15:12.805 --> 15:14.485
-[Braden] Thirty-five pounds, right?
-Yeah.

15:15.005 --> 15:15.885
[Braden] All right.

15:15.965 --> 15:16.925
Okay.

15:26.245 --> 15:27.325
Hot date?

15:29.565 --> 15:30.445
Sorry, what?

15:30.925 --> 15:32.005
Just saw you washing

15:32.325 --> 15:34.085
in a puddle from a drain,

15:34.165 --> 15:36.245
and I wondered
if it was a special occasion.

15:36.805 --> 15:37.805
Not really, no.

15:38.965 --> 15:42.085
Gonna buy drugs with that
and dump the papers in the skip?

15:43.485 --> 15:46.685
Well, I should probably dump them first,
then buy the drugs.

15:46.765 --> 15:48.765
I'll forget otherwise, won't I?

16:19.365 --> 16:20.525
Where's Lisa?

16:23.245 --> 16:24.445
She's dead, Dad.

16:25.365 --> 16:26.325
Remember?

16:27.125 --> 16:28.485
She died earlier this year.

16:29.925 --> 16:31.525
She was here this morning.

16:32.605 --> 16:33.805
No, she wasn't.

16:35.965 --> 16:36.805
[nurse] Hi.

16:37.525 --> 16:38.365
Hi.

16:39.325 --> 16:40.485
[nurse] Right.

16:42.205 --> 16:44.205
Let's get you sorted, Ray, eh?

16:46.925 --> 16:48.805
If it was a dog, you'd put it down.

16:49.925 --> 16:50.805
It?

16:51.365 --> 16:53.045
I was sort of being nice, that...

16:54.365 --> 16:55.645
I feel sorry for him.

16:58.925 --> 17:00.925
Well, don't you ever feel sorry for them?

17:02.205 --> 17:03.605
I worry when they cry.

17:05.685 --> 17:08.725
We say there's nothing going on inside
to make ourselves feel better,

17:08.805 --> 17:10.765
but there's definitely something going on.

17:11.245 --> 17:12.085
Eh?

17:15.925 --> 17:17.005
You married?

17:18.925 --> 17:20.365
No time for that. [chuckles]

17:21.445 --> 17:23.005
I'll give you a good seeing to.

17:23.445 --> 17:24.365
I'm sorry.

17:24.805 --> 17:25.725
It's all right.

17:27.525 --> 17:29.165
Never heard any complaints.

17:30.325 --> 17:31.725
Kept the wife happy.

17:36.325 --> 17:37.685
I've gotta go.

17:40.245 --> 17:41.165
See you later.

17:41.525 --> 17:42.485
See you, Dad.

17:43.805 --> 17:45.125
Bring Lisa with you.

17:45.485 --> 17:46.525
[Tony] Fuck me!

17:46.925 --> 17:48.085
Yeah, all right.

17:48.165 --> 17:49.525
Jesus Christ!

17:51.485 --> 17:52.325
[Tony] Good girl.

17:53.725 --> 17:55.005
[sighs wearily]

17:59.445 --> 18:00.765
Oh, fuckin' hell.

18:03.765 --> 18:04.765
No bowls.

18:04.965 --> 18:06.645
Fuck's sake.

18:06.725 --> 18:07.885
[sighs]

18:20.725 --> 18:21.565
[packet thuds]

18:23.565 --> 18:26.205
Of course! No fuckin' milk!

18:48.645 --> 18:50.085
[Lisa]<i> Don't wallow, eh?</i>

18:50.165 --> 18:51.365
<i>Stay active.</i>

18:52.045 --> 18:53.725
<i>And keep our house tidy.</i>

18:54.085 --> 18:55.165
<i>Our lovely house.</i>

18:56.885 --> 18:58.925
<i>And don't get drunk all the time,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

18:59.325 --> 19:01.565
<i>'Cause it'll only make you feel worse</i>
<i>in the long run.</i>

19:02.125 --> 19:03.205
<i>I'm not a doctor,</i>

19:03.285 --> 19:05.685
<i>but I have spoken to loads of 'em</i>
<i>over the last few months,</i>

19:05.765 --> 19:09.845
<i>and they all reckon it's not ideal</i>
<i>to be a fat, lazy, self-pitying lump.</i>

19:12.125 --> 19:14.085
<i>If you put the dishes</i>
<i>straight in the dishwasher,</i>

19:14.165 --> 19:15.085
<i>it don't build up.</i>

19:15.645 --> 19:17.605
<i>And change the salt every now and then.</i>

19:17.685 --> 19:18.965
<i>The salt's in the garage.</i>

19:19.445 --> 19:22.125
<i>The garage is that massive thing</i>
<i>on the side of the house.</i>

19:23.965 --> 19:24.845
[doorbell rings]

19:26.925 --> 19:27.885
[sighs]

19:28.765 --> 19:30.765
[under breath] Oh, fuck's sake.

19:32.325 --> 19:33.525
You all right, yeah?

19:34.125 --> 19:35.325
I was worried about you.

19:35.765 --> 19:37.525
-Why?
-What do you mean, "why"?

19:37.645 --> 19:39.365
You're always talking about
killing yourself.

19:40.165 --> 19:42.645
Also, you should be at work,
but you know I'll let that slide.

19:42.725 --> 19:43.565
[scoffs]

19:43.725 --> 19:45.565
Come to the pub.
Me and Len are going for lunch.

19:45.645 --> 19:46.885
No, I've had lunch.

19:46.965 --> 19:47.805
Come on.

19:48.085 --> 19:49.765
-We used to go to the pub all the time.
-No!

19:49.845 --> 19:52.285
Someone will make me angry,
and that's the day ruined.

19:52.365 --> 19:54.405
Yeah, I'll take that chance, Bruce Banner.

19:54.925 --> 19:56.085
It'll do you good.

19:56.365 --> 19:58.565
Come on, please.
All journalists go to the pub for lunch.

19:58.645 --> 19:59.805
We're not journalists.

19:59.885 --> 20:01.805
We <i>are</i> journalists.
We work for a newspaper.

20:02.165 --> 20:05.205
Yeah, and that newspaper
is used to line cat litter trays

20:05.285 --> 20:07.005
by old ladies, once a week.

20:07.565 --> 20:09.085
And they read it before they do that.

20:09.165 --> 20:10.405
-We're not journalists.
-We are.

20:10.485 --> 20:11.845
-We're journalists.
-No, we're not.

20:11.925 --> 20:12.925
-Yes, we are.
-Not.

20:13.005 --> 20:14.365
-Stop saying that. We are.
-Not.

20:14.445 --> 20:15.885
-Fuckin' hell!
-[loud crunching]

20:15.965 --> 20:17.165
Can you hear that?

20:17.765 --> 20:21.685
Fuckin' fat cunt
eating like a fuckin' slug.

20:22.645 --> 20:25.165
-Doing my fuckin' head in.
-[Braden] All right.

20:25.565 --> 20:27.245
Why don't you throw yourself
into your work?

20:27.325 --> 20:29.085
-I can't concentrate with that...
-[crunching]

20:29.165 --> 20:31.085
-Fuckin' hell!
-[Braden] They're crisps. They're crunchy.

20:31.165 --> 20:33.525
Yeah, but why does he have to do all that
"mm mmm"?

20:36.365 --> 20:37.325
Well, this is fun.

20:37.405 --> 20:38.325
Told you.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.565
You told me? Great.

20:40.685 --> 20:41.805
Always someone who spoils it.

20:41.885 --> 20:43.885
And do you think that might be you
on this occasion?

20:43.965 --> 20:45.085
-No.
-[loud crunching]

20:45.165 --> 20:47.805
-[Tony sighs]
-Look, just ignore him, okay?

20:47.885 --> 20:50.365
As I was saying, why don't you
throw yourself into your work?

20:50.445 --> 20:51.845
That's what depressed people do.

20:51.925 --> 20:52.805
Sometimes.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.565
It's hard for me to throw myself
into my work, when my work

20:55.645 --> 20:58.365
is often talking to a plumber
on the estate

20:58.445 --> 21:00.965
who's grown a potato
that looks like Lionel Richie.

21:01.045 --> 21:02.285
That made the front cover.

21:02.365 --> 21:03.525
It did look like him, though.

21:03.605 --> 21:04.765
Actually, this is a good time.

21:04.845 --> 21:06.525
We've got some exciting leads
at the moment.

21:06.605 --> 21:07.725
-Leads?
-Yeah.

21:07.805 --> 21:09.445
Like we're Woodward and Bernstein?

21:09.525 --> 21:10.925
-They <i>are</i> leads.
-Go on. What leads?

21:11.005 --> 21:12.645
-What "leads" do we have?
-All right.

21:12.725 --> 21:14.605
A woman called us.
When she drags her dustbin,

21:14.685 --> 21:16.045
it sounds like Chewbacca.

21:18.565 --> 21:20.245
-No.
-No? All right. Um...

21:20.325 --> 21:22.285
Woman on Blagden Road woke up Chinese.

21:24.325 --> 21:25.485
And she wasn't before.

21:26.405 --> 21:27.645
No, I get the angle.

21:27.725 --> 21:31.045
Man who got sent
the same birthday card five times.

21:31.125 --> 21:32.325
-Really?
-[Tony] <i>Really?</i>

21:32.405 --> 21:34.685
-[Braden] Yeah.
-Right, let's get to the bottom of that

21:34.765 --> 21:35.885
<i>ASAP.</i>

21:36.925 --> 21:38.365
[Braden] Well, yes. Why don't you?

21:38.605 --> 21:39.885
'Cause that is your job.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.045
-I know.
-Yeah.

21:48.045 --> 21:49.325
[Tony] Ring the doorbell.

21:50.245 --> 21:51.645
[doorbell rings]

21:53.765 --> 21:55.085
You... You disgusting--

21:55.165 --> 21:56.805
[Lenny] I didn't wanna do it
in his house.

21:56.885 --> 21:58.645
Go to the doctor.
You've got bowel cancer.

21:58.765 --> 22:00.165
-Hello.
-Don't come out. This fat cunt's

22:00.245 --> 22:01.725
-shat himself.
-Are you from the paper?

22:01.805 --> 22:03.125
Yeah. Leave him there for a while.

22:03.205 --> 22:04.445
You fuckin' pig.

22:07.245 --> 22:08.525
[camera clicks]

22:10.645 --> 22:12.245
[man] When I got the first one,
I thought,

22:12.485 --> 22:14.405
"That's a nice card."

22:14.845 --> 22:18.405
And then I got the second, and I thought,
"Oh, that's funny. Two the same!" [laughs]

22:18.725 --> 22:20.965
[chuckling] But then when I got the <i>third,</i>

22:21.405 --> 22:23.525
I thought,
"Well, what are the chances of that?"

22:23.605 --> 22:24.805
Astronomical.

22:24.885 --> 22:25.845
And then the fourth...

22:26.685 --> 22:27.525
Wow!

22:27.885 --> 22:28.845
[whispers] Wow.

22:28.925 --> 22:30.845
[man] But then, five... I mean,

22:30.925 --> 22:32.885
I bet that's never happened before.

22:32.965 --> 22:34.685
Not on record anyway.

22:35.245 --> 22:37.885
-[man] Are you taking notes?
-Yeah, all in there.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.685
Is this going to be
in next week's newspaper?

22:42.085 --> 22:43.845
Yeah, we'll rush this through.

22:43.925 --> 22:44.805
Quite a scoop.

22:44.885 --> 22:47.805
Oh, my Denise would be tickled by this.

22:47.885 --> 22:49.045
That's my wife.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.205
She passed away last year.

22:52.445 --> 22:53.525
Light of my life.

22:54.405 --> 22:55.285
Anything that happens,

22:55.365 --> 22:56.965
I go to tell her.

22:57.045 --> 22:58.365
Then I remember.

22:59.285 --> 23:01.325
Nothing's as good if you don't share it.

23:02.605 --> 23:04.325
Still have my downs,

23:04.405 --> 23:08.405
but then life throws you these
interesting little things, doesn't it?

23:08.885 --> 23:10.605
You can't feel sorry for yourself.

23:11.285 --> 23:12.485
Got to keep going.

23:14.725 --> 23:15.765
Happy birthday.

23:16.525 --> 23:18.285
Oh. Thanks.

23:22.685 --> 23:24.365
[Tony, under breath] Fuck's sake.

23:29.605 --> 23:32.285
Excuse me. Where's the dog food?

23:32.565 --> 23:33.965
It's by the cat food.

23:34.325 --> 23:35.565
[Tony] Right, well...

23:35.765 --> 23:37.365
I've got another question then.

23:37.525 --> 23:38.725
Where's the cat food?

23:39.165 --> 23:41.125
Tinned products, aisle two.

23:41.805 --> 23:43.525
Cheers. Don't get up.

23:44.165 --> 23:45.045
Okay.

23:48.205 --> 23:49.685
-[cashier] That everything?
-Yeah.

23:49.925 --> 23:51.285
-Oh.
-[scanner beeps]

23:56.045 --> 23:57.205
[footsteps]

24:01.325 --> 24:03.325
[menacing music]

24:06.005 --> 24:08.125
[man] All right, mate. You got any money?

24:09.005 --> 24:09.845
[Tony sighs]

24:11.325 --> 24:12.565
-Yeah.
-What?

24:15.525 --> 24:17.085
Yes, I've got money.

24:18.005 --> 24:19.125
Give it to me then.

24:25.325 --> 24:28.045
-Why?
-I'll fuckin' kill you if you don't.

24:30.285 --> 24:31.725
Does that usually work, does it?

24:32.165 --> 24:33.485
To most people,

24:33.565 --> 24:36.885
the threat of death
is <i>worse</i> than giving you money,

24:37.645 --> 24:38.565
but...

24:38.645 --> 24:40.685
Or they're worried
you'll hurt their family or...

24:40.965 --> 24:42.245
I haven't got any family.

24:42.805 --> 24:45.685
So, I'm not gonna go into it,
but I don't care about anything anymore.

24:45.765 --> 24:46.885
I'm not giving you any money.

24:47.285 --> 24:48.325
Are you mental?

24:48.405 --> 24:51.605
No, I'm just tired of doing things
I don't wanna do,

24:51.685 --> 24:52.965
and we always have a choice.

24:53.045 --> 24:54.445
And if I've read this right,

24:54.925 --> 24:55.965
my choice

24:56.205 --> 24:57.285
is either violence

24:57.765 --> 24:59.925
or hand over my money peacefully...

25:01.085 --> 25:02.765
to two useless little cunts.

25:03.445 --> 25:04.725
-Are you mad? [grunts]
-[Tony] No.

25:05.085 --> 25:07.205
-Fuck off! Okay?
-[man groans]

25:09.005 --> 25:10.885
Just... fuck off.
