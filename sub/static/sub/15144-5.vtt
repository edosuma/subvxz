14:21.667 --> 14:26.375
for Extreme Hide-and-Seek.

14:26.417 --> 14:28.750
[all cheering]

14:31.709 --> 14:32.750
So...

14:32.792 --> 14:34.583
I heard you and

14:32.792 --> 14:34.583
our brother are an item.

14:34.625 --> 14:37.667
Shh! It's all pretend

14:34.625 --> 14:37.667
to get my cabinmates

14:37.709 --> 14:38.959
to do activities with me.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.750
Camp is finally

14:39.000 --> 14:40.750
starting to be fun.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.333
Well, camp won't be

14:40.792 --> 14:42.333
fun for me

14:42.375 --> 14:44.041
till I get to use

14:42.375 --> 14:44.041
that telescope.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.166
So I'm gonna need you to drop

14:44.083 --> 14:46.166
the Dicky

14:46.208 --> 14:49.500
and get with the Ricky.

14:49.542 --> 14:51.959
Hey, guys?

14:49.542 --> 14:51.959
Are the rumors true?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.583
Yes, Dicky

14:52.000 --> 14:54.583
is Dawn's boyfriend.

14:54.625 --> 14:56.041
Whoa!

14:56.083 --> 14:59.959
I was talking about the

14:56.083 --> 14:59.959
camp sunscreen being expired...

15:00.000 --> 15:02.083
but this is much more

15:00.000 --> 15:02.083
disturbing.

15:02.125 --> 15:03.667
It's all fake, Nicky.

15:03.709 --> 15:06.291
Yeah, but she's about to fake

15:03.709 --> 15:06.291
break up with him to be with me.

15:06.333 --> 15:07.667
Um, no I'm not, Ricky.

15:07.709 --> 15:10.250
I'm perfectly happy

15:07.709 --> 15:10.250
in my current fake situation.

15:10.291 --> 15:13.709
Ooh, fake breakup.

15:13.750 --> 15:15.583
That's how I can

15:13.750 --> 15:15.583
get through to Ty.

15:15.625 --> 15:17.750
This may be playing

15:15.625 --> 15:17.750
with fire,

15:17.792 --> 15:20.125
but it's safer than

15:17.792 --> 15:20.125
playing with fire.

15:20.166 --> 15:22.500
So, if anyone asks,

15:20.166 --> 15:22.500
you're my ex-girlfriend,

15:22.542 --> 15:24.291
and you broke my heart.

15:24.333 --> 15:26.041
Thanks, sis.

15:26.083 --> 15:28.458
There's my boo

15:26.083 --> 15:28.458
from cabin two.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.458
Ew. What happened

15:28.500 --> 15:30.458
to your face?

15:30.500 --> 15:33.291
According to the warning label

15:30.500 --> 15:33.291
on my jar of dirt,

15:33.333 --> 15:35.250
it's probably a fungus.

15:35.291 --> 15:37.375
Is it really noticeable?

15:37.417 --> 15:39.417
Yeah, a little bit.

15:39.458 --> 15:40.500
Forget that.

15:40.542 --> 15:42.458
Lilly saw us making

15:40.542 --> 15:42.458
dream catchers,

15:42.500 --> 15:44.208
and now she's totally jealous.

15:44.250 --> 15:45.959
Couple more camp activities

15:44.250 --> 15:45.959
together,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.709
and I can dump you

15:46.000 --> 15:48.709
and upgrade to a girl

15:48.750 --> 15:51.625
who's not my sister.

15:51.667 --> 15:54.458
Okay, this is

15:51.667 --> 15:54.458
the worst hiding spot ever.

15:54.500 --> 15:57.417
There's the cutest

15:54.500 --> 15:57.417
couple at camp!

15:57.458 --> 15:58.875
- [gasps] Aah!

15:57.458 --> 15:58.875
- Nasty!

15:58.917 --> 16:00.458
Dump him now!

16:00.500 --> 16:03.792
Dicky, it's over.

16:00.500 --> 16:03.792
It's not you. It's your face.

16:03.834 --> 16:07.333
She's already moved on

16:03.834 --> 16:07.333
to the Rickster.

16:07.375 --> 16:08.500
Who?

16:08.542 --> 16:10.625
Me, I'm the Rickster.

16:10.667 --> 16:13.500
And we're very happy.

16:13.542 --> 16:16.625
Now we know somebody

16:13.542 --> 16:16.625
who's had two boyfriends.

16:16.667 --> 16:18.041
Picture!

16:18.083 --> 16:20.041
[camera shutter clicks]

16:30.542 --> 16:32.500
Ty?

16:32.542 --> 16:35.542
Are you slow-dancing

16:32.542 --> 16:35.542
with Daphne's microphone

16:35.583 --> 16:36.625
taped to a broom?

16:36.667 --> 16:39.709
No.

16:36.667 --> 16:39.709
[laughs] Yeah.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.208
No. Yeah.

16:42.250 --> 16:45.208
No, no.

16:42.250 --> 16:45.208
[laughs] Maybe.

16:45.250 --> 16:48.250
No. Yeah.

16:50.291 --> 16:52.375
Listen, man, you don't know

16:50.291 --> 16:52.375
what it's like

16:52.417 --> 16:55.250
to be crushed by an angel.

16:55.291 --> 16:59.083
You're wrong. I've also

16:55.291 --> 16:59.083
been crushed by an angel.

16:59.125 --> 17:03.750
You may know her as...

16:59.125 --> 17:03.750
Camper Dawn.

17:03.792 --> 17:05.625
The one that was

17:03.792 --> 17:05.625
with Camper Dicky

17:05.667 --> 17:07.583
but is now

17:05.667 --> 17:07.583
with Camper Ricky?

17:07.625 --> 17:08.792
She's what?

17:08.834 --> 17:11.959
No, see, that doesn't

17:08.834 --> 17:11.959
even bother me.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.709
You know

17:12.000 --> 17:13.709
how I got over her?

17:13.750 --> 17:15.792
I focused

17:13.750 --> 17:15.792
on other things...

17:15.834 --> 17:18.792
like camp safety,

17:15.834 --> 17:18.792
and you should too.

17:18.834 --> 17:22.875
Yeah. You know,

17:18.834 --> 17:22.875
maybe you're right.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.667
[sighs]

17:22.917 --> 17:24.667
Maybe I should, Camper Nicky,

17:24.709 --> 17:27.500
and just forget

17:24.709 --> 17:27.500
about how Daphne

17:27.542 --> 17:30.417
was the greatest thing

17:27.542 --> 17:30.417
that ever happened to me.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.208
I was?

17:32.250 --> 17:33.750
Daphne?

17:33.792 --> 17:34.917
Ty?

17:36.041 --> 17:39.000
- Daphne.

17:36.041 --> 17:39.000
- Oh, Ty.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.083
Thank you so much.

17:44.125 --> 17:47.125
You've made me so happy, and now

17:44.125 --> 17:47.125
I'm gonna make you happy.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.625
Great. You're gonna start

17:47.166 --> 17:49.625
focusing on camp safety?

17:49.667 --> 17:52.834
No. I'm gonna get you

17:49.667 --> 17:52.834
and Camper Dawn back together.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.875
Oh, please don't.

17:54.917 --> 17:58.083
[all giggling]

17:58.125 --> 18:00.959
Um, Ricky-pie?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.875
How much longer are

18:01.000 --> 18:02.875
you gonna be?

18:02.917 --> 18:04.083
Patience, Dawny-cakes.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.000
It's still not dark enough

18:06.041 --> 18:08.834
to see Ursa Major

18:06.041 --> 18:08.834
or Cassiopeia.

18:08.875 --> 18:12.917
[Ty on loudspeaker]

18:08.875 --> 18:12.917
Camper Dawn, please report

18:08.875 --> 18:12.917
to Bear Claw Point.

18:12.959 --> 18:16.542
Yes!

18:12.959 --> 18:16.542
Cassio-see ya!

18:17.750 --> 18:20.875
Uh, Nicky,

18:17.750 --> 18:20.875
what's going on?

18:20.917 --> 18:22.291
This might sound strange,

18:22.333 --> 18:23.917
but for the safety of everyone

18:22.333 --> 18:23.917
at camp,

18:23.959 --> 18:27.041
you need to dump Ricky and fake

18:23.959 --> 18:27.041
get back together with me.

18:30.917 --> 18:32.375
They're flowers.

18:35.917 --> 18:39.291
[gasps]

18:35.917 --> 18:39.291
Oh, this has to stop!

18:39.333 --> 18:41.709
There you are.

18:39.333 --> 18:41.709
I need you back.

18:41.750 --> 18:44.875
Lilly won't pay attention to me

18:41.750 --> 18:44.875
unless I'm hanging out with you.

18:44.917 --> 18:46.834
[coughs]

18:46.875 --> 18:48.834
Dawn's already taken...

18:48.875 --> 18:50.875
by the Rickster.

18:50.917 --> 18:52.041
Who?

18:52.083 --> 18:54.625
Me, I'm the Rickster.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.458
No, she's mine.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.166
No, she's mine.

18:59.208 --> 19:00.417
[boys grunting]

19:00.458 --> 19:02.750
Dawn is mine!

19:00.458 --> 19:02.750
I need her way more than you do!

Hey, those are my flowers!

[all shouting]

19:08.917 --> 19:12.000
Where is this camp?

19:08.917 --> 19:12.000
Ugh. I hope we're not lost.

19:12.041 --> 19:14.125
Don't worry. I'm leaving

19:12.041 --> 19:14.125
a trail of pancakes

19:14.166 --> 19:16.834
so we can find

19:14.166 --> 19:16.834
our way back.

19:16.875 --> 19:17.875
[children arguing]

19:17.917 --> 19:19.875
Wait, wait.

19:17.917 --> 19:19.875
I hear kids arguing.

19:19.917 --> 19:22.125
- [gasps] We must be close!

19:19.917 --> 19:22.125
- Shh!

19:22.166 --> 19:23.834
Remember,

19:22.166 --> 19:23.834
no parents allowed.

19:23.875 --> 19:26.917
So be quiet

19:23.875 --> 19:26.917
with your big loud feet.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.250
Aaah!

19:29.291 --> 19:31.041
- Are you okay?

19:29.291 --> 19:31.041
- Yes. Yeah.

19:31.083 --> 19:33.583
- Okay.

19:31.083 --> 19:33.583
- I think I'm okay.

19:31.083 --> 19:33.583
- You sure?

19:31.083 --> 19:33.583
- Wow.

19:33.625 --> 19:37.375
Aaaah!

19:37.417 --> 19:40.291
Oh! Wow!

19:37.417 --> 19:40.291
That stick hates me.

19:40.333 --> 19:43.500
Aaah!

19:43.542 --> 19:44.583
[grunts]

19:44.625 --> 19:45.625
Aaah!

19:45.667 --> 19:46.792
No!

19:46.834 --> 19:48.333
Why do I keep walking into--

19:48.375 --> 19:49.542
Aaah!

19:49.583 --> 19:50.875
No!

19:50.917 --> 19:51.959
Are you doing this

19:50.917 --> 19:51.959

19:52.000 --> 19:54.583
Aaaah!

19:54.625 --> 19:56.875
Uh, what was that?

19:56.917 --> 19:59.875
Well, if I've learned anything

19:56.917 --> 19:59.875
since my fifth birthday...

19:59.917 --> 20:00.959
[Tom yelling]

20:01.000 --> 20:03.041
- That's an elephant!

20:01.000 --> 20:03.041
- It's a bear!

20:03.083 --> 20:05.375
[all]

20:03.083 --> 20:05.375
Bear!

20:05.417 --> 20:08.834
Whatever!

20:11.875 --> 20:15.834
of pancakes leading right to us.

20:15.875 --> 20:18.834
- Oh, no! Bears love pancakes!

20:15.875 --> 20:18.834
- I know!

20:18.875 --> 20:21.083
[screaming]

20:21.125 --> 20:23.166
Okay, all right, all right,

20:21.125 --> 20:23.166
you know what they say.

20:23.208 --> 20:26.917
The best way to scare off a bear

20:23.208 --> 20:26.917
is to act like a bear.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.000
[growling]

20:29.041 --> 20:32.917
- Guys! Guys, stop!

20:29.041 --> 20:32.917
I can't run anymore.

20:32.959 --> 20:34.792
Do any of you know

20:32.959 --> 20:34.792
the way back to camp?

20:34.834 --> 20:35.792
[boys]

20:34.834 --> 20:35.792
No!

20:35.834 --> 20:36.917

20:38.333 --> 20:40.333
I can't believe this is

20:38.333 --> 20:40.333
our first camp experience.

20:40.375 --> 20:42.375
I just wanted to do camp stuff

20:40.375 --> 20:42.375
and have fun.

20:42.417 --> 20:45.375
Me too. I know we all get on

20:42.417 --> 20:45.375
each other's nerves sometimes,

20:45.417 --> 20:49.000
but I have to admit,

20:45.417 --> 20:49.000
camp was hard without you.

20:49.041 --> 20:50.291
And dangerous!

20:50.333 --> 20:52.125
And I wish I packed

20:50.333 --> 20:52.125
more underwear.

20:53.417 --> 20:55.000
None of this

20:53.417 --> 20:55.000
would have happened

20:55.041 --> 20:56.500
if we'd just told the truth.

I'm proud to say it loud.
