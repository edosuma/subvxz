00:01.210 --> 00:02.334
Gordon:<i> Previously</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

00:02.378 --> 00:05.337
It's time
to remove those aprons.

00:05.381 --> 00:08.966
From now on, you'll be
battling it out all alone.

00:09.010 --> 00:11.635
Teams are no longer existing.

00:11.679 --> 00:15.723
You will be placed on a level
based off of your performances.

00:15.766 --> 00:18.267
Gordon: For the next challenge,
there were only two dishes

00:18.310 --> 00:20.644
that were good enough
to make it to the top.

00:20.688 --> 00:24.314
Our bottom dishes are all
heading to the basement,

00:24.358 --> 00:28.318
but not before you all face off
in the elimination cook-off.

00:28.404 --> 00:32.072
Richard:
Gordon and nyesha, I'm gonna ask
you to choose the weakest dish.

00:32.158 --> 00:34.783
- Gordon: Drunken noodles.
- I'm gonna go have to go
with the drunken noodles

00:34.785 --> 00:35.951
as my least favorite dish.

00:36.287 --> 00:41.373
Unfortunately, ae, you will
not be the next level chef.

00:41.417 --> 00:42.624
<i> Tonight...</i>

00:42.960 --> 00:46.336
Your job is to grab ingredients
from two different countries

00:46.380 --> 00:48.964
and create
an amazing fusion dish.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.841
I am not ready
for today's challenge.

00:50.885 --> 00:54.303
I have never felt so lost.

00:54.305 --> 00:57.264
I'm not confident in putting
together a cohesive dish.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.266
- This is not
next level cooking.
- Yes, chef.

00:59.310 --> 01:01.935
Richard:
I think this is the toughest
challenge we've had so far.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.145
Please taste good.
Please taste good.

01:03.189 --> 01:04.313
( spits )

01:04.356 --> 01:06.899
your sandbagging me here.
( bleep ) hell.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.525
Really?
This is ( bleep ).

01:27.922 --> 01:31.048
Welcome back.
Line up, please.

01:32.927 --> 01:36.345
Throughout this competition,
we've challenged you
to think fast, work hard,

01:36.347 --> 01:41.141
get better, and show us
your real love for food.

01:41.143 --> 01:43.977
Now listen, after mentoring you
here for so many weeks,

01:43.979 --> 01:45.979
it's been a thrill
for the three of us

01:45.981 --> 01:48.315
to finally watch you cook
on your own now,

01:48.359 --> 01:49.775
and we couldn't be more proud
of those of you

01:49.819 --> 01:53.195
who have rose up a level
based on your amazing dishes.

01:53.239 --> 01:56.115
It was also a little frustrating
to watch some of you

01:56.158 --> 01:59.159
because we're still seeing
a lot of untapped potential.

01:59.203 --> 02:02.579
Now's the time to step up
and level up.

02:02.623 --> 02:06.917
The next level chef must be able
to master cuisines

02:06.919 --> 02:08.293
from around the world.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.338
Fusion has become a staple
in the culinary world,
let me tell you.

02:11.382 --> 02:14.174
So for today's challenge,

02:14.218 --> 02:18.595
you'll have 40 minutes to create
an amazing fusion dish.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.181
When the platform drops,
you'll find ingredients

02:21.225 --> 02:24.393
representing
14 different countries.

02:24.436 --> 02:28.063
Each country will be represented
by a basket of ingredients

02:28.065 --> 02:30.232
native to that country.

02:30.234 --> 02:33.652
Your job is to grab ingredients
from two baskets

02:33.696 --> 02:36.905
and combine them to create
an amazing fusion dish.

02:36.991 --> 02:37.990
Courtney:
<i> This is a tough one.</i>

02:38.284 --> 02:41.535
You are going to have to be
extremely creative

02:41.579 --> 02:43.287
<i> to make fusion work.</i>

02:43.330 --> 02:47.082
As you know, where you cook
is determined by how you cook.

02:47.126 --> 02:50.210
And based on your dishes
across that previous challenge,

02:50.254 --> 02:54.256
mariah and reuel will cook
in that top level kitchen today.

02:54.258 --> 02:58.010
In the middle,
courtney, angie, and tricia.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.262
And our survivors
of the elimination,

03:00.264 --> 03:03.307
pyet and kenny,
you'll be down in that basement.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.810
This is your opportunity
to take our palates

03:06.854 --> 03:07.978
on a trip around the world.

03:08.022 --> 03:13.025
Mariah, reuel,
take a keycard on the right

03:13.068 --> 03:14.067
and head up to that top level.

03:14.069 --> 03:17.196
Gordon: Two countries.
Good luck.

03:22.328 --> 03:24.494
Is there anything you want me
to look out for you?

03:25.915 --> 03:26.955
I don't know what
reuel's trying to do.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.790
Is there a particular genre?

03:28.834 --> 03:29.875
- No.
- I'm not here to screw you.

03:29.919 --> 03:31.084
We're not working in groups
no more.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.712
<i> There's $250,000 on the line.</i>

03:33.756 --> 03:35.672
I've known people for ten years
I don't trust.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.299
I just met you in this elevator.

03:37.760 --> 03:41.511
If you're looking for anything
in particular, I will definitely
call it out for you.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.471
I'm good.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.185
What country y'all want?

03:48.229 --> 03:51.063
I want texas and mexico.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.357
Angie:
<i> I've made it through</i>
<i> each challenge</i>

03:53.400 --> 03:55.234
and I've never been
to elimination.

03:55.236 --> 03:58.987
As a home cook,
nobody treats me like a threat.

03:59.031 --> 04:01.949
I think I'm gonna go
for this one over here.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.576
And when I win,
I want them to go,

04:04.620 --> 04:06.954
"where the ( bleep )
did she come from?"

04:07.039 --> 04:09.456
honey, we're home.

04:11.335 --> 04:14.336
- All right. We are here.
- Mm-hmm.

04:14.380 --> 04:17.214
This is not where
I'm supposed to be.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.299
Unfortunately,
the last challenge,

04:19.343 --> 04:21.551
I didn't perform,
so here I am.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.178
This is one ugly pot.

04:23.222 --> 04:26.139
Time to get my ass
where I belong, which is
on that top level.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.517
- Can't say I've
missed this place.
- Mm-hmm.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.815
- All right, blais' basement.
- For sure.

04:34.817 --> 04:37.067
Let's go.
How we feeling, chefs?
We feeling good?

04:37.111 --> 04:38.568
We feeling good, chef.
Time to make magic.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.741
- Chef arrington!
- Boom, boom!

04:44.785 --> 04:47.035
- How are you today?
- I'm wonderful. How are you?

04:47.121 --> 04:48.578
- I'm great.
- How are we feeling?

04:48.580 --> 04:49.579
- Good, chef.
- Excellent.

04:49.832 --> 04:53.250
I want to put my type
of cuisine on the plate.

04:53.252 --> 04:55.002
Hoping for a japanese
inspiration today?

04:55.045 --> 04:56.336
- Yes.
- Excellent, excellent.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.255
If reuel doesn't get it first.

04:58.299 --> 05:01.133
I can't say
I'm super experienced

05:01.176 --> 05:03.218
with fusion cuisine,

05:03.262 --> 05:05.345
<i> but I have cooked a lot</i>
<i> of japanese food.</i>

05:05.389 --> 05:09.558
I'm hoping to god, "please,
let me have the japan basket."

05:09.601 --> 05:12.102
that would just make everything
so perfect.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.318
- Right, we good? Mariah?
- Yes, chef.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.653
You saw what it means
to cook in eliminations.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.113
- Yes, chef.
- You gotta stay out of them.

05:23.115 --> 05:26.241
I haven't been
in the elimination round yet,

05:26.285 --> 05:28.827
and I'm not planning
to be there.

05:28.871 --> 05:32.414
So I'm just hoping
something comes my way
that's within my background

05:32.416 --> 05:34.291
so I can be like,
"okay, I have the tools.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.418
Let's elevate this
as best as possible."

05:36.462 --> 05:38.879
all right, everyone,
let's line up on the back rail.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.923
We're gunning for it.
Make sure there's
a clear path to success.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.008
All: Yes, chef.

05:43.052 --> 05:44.968
Two amazing countries,

05:45.012 --> 05:47.471
one next level dish, please.

05:52.353 --> 05:55.062
They'll be a basket there
with a protein. Grab that.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.396
Reuel:<i> I'm at the platform.</i>

05:56.398 --> 05:58.273
<i> I'm looking for</i>
<i> a caribbean island.</i>

05:58.317 --> 06:01.651
The flags kinda
threw me off a bit,
and then I see japan.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.604
<i> I recognize that flag.</i>
<i> Let me grab that.</i>

06:04.615 --> 06:06.865
Mariah:<i> I see thailand</i>
<i> with some beautiful</i>
<i> red spotted prawns,</i>

06:06.909 --> 06:08.784
so I grab that basket.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.285
<i> This is gonna be easier,</i>

06:10.287 --> 06:12.579
because I don't
have to manually grab
each ingredient.

06:12.623 --> 06:15.123
I'm just grabbing a basket.
So I'm like, "okay,
I got this in the bag."

06:15.167 --> 06:17.417
gordon: Then go back
for the second country.

06:17.461 --> 06:19.586
Ten, nine, eight.
Come on, guys!

06:19.588 --> 06:21.046
You'll be in the elimination!

06:21.090 --> 06:23.340
I grab mexico because I see
some chili peppers in there,

06:23.384 --> 06:26.051
and I know that would really
compliment the spotted prawns

06:26.095 --> 06:28.637
- from the thai basket.
- Gordon: You've got it, yes?

06:28.639 --> 06:30.889
- Reuel:
<i> I'm running out of time. </i>
- Gordon: Grab one. Grab one.

06:30.933 --> 06:34.810
<i> Before the platform goes,</i>
<i> I grab the basket</i>
<i> in front of me.</i>

06:34.853 --> 06:38.772
Spain. Spain and japan.

06:38.774 --> 06:40.065
That's gonna be tough.

06:40.109 --> 06:41.900
- Here it comes.
- Okay.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.277
Here it comes, ladies.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.238
- Go!
- ( indistinct chatter )

06:46.240 --> 06:48.532
quick, grab two countries.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.117
Oh, my god.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.036
I'm circling the platform.
There's no japan at all.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.956
Nyesha: One protein
and one additional box.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.040
<i> There's France up there.</i>

06:57.418 --> 06:59.751
I don't really want it,
but I don't know the other ones,

06:59.795 --> 07:02.838
- so I take it.
- A protein.
I've gotta get a protein.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.089
I see veal.
I haven't done veal yet.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.967
<i> It's Italy.</i>
<i> I can do Italy in my sleep.</i>

07:07.010 --> 07:08.718
15 seconds left, guys.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.887
I have a strong italian
influence from my dad's side,

07:10.889 --> 07:14.224
<i> and I have</i>
<i> a strong german influence</i>
<i> from my mom's side.</i>

07:14.226 --> 07:16.601
<i> So I see that cabbage,</i>
<i> I see that mustard,</i>

07:16.603 --> 07:18.562
and I'm like,
"oh, yes. Germany it is."

07:18.605 --> 07:19.771
ooh.

07:20.107 --> 07:23.442
Very familiar
with indian cooking,
so I pick that up.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.652
Ten, nine, eight...

07:25.696 --> 07:28.989
I'm trying to figure out, "okay,
what goes well with india?"

07:29.032 --> 07:30.949
<i> and I settle on vietnam.</i>

07:30.993 --> 07:32.492
Three, two...

07:32.578 --> 07:36.997
Second basket, I pick greece.
What is french and greek fusion?

07:36.999 --> 07:39.207
- One!
- Excuse me.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.172
Let's go, basement!

07:45.215 --> 07:49.050
<i> I see the steak</i>
<i> on top of brazil,</i>

07:49.094 --> 07:51.803
and I'm thinking,
"yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

07:51.847 --> 07:52.846
<i> Your girl got a good protein."</i>

07:53.056 --> 07:55.056
kenny:<i> I'm shopping</i>
<i> on the clearance rack,</i>

07:55.058 --> 07:56.725
so I grab china.

07:56.768 --> 07:59.302
Richard:
So you got one protein,
one additional box.

07:59.304 --> 08:02.230
I see the israel box,
and I'm feeling very confident

08:02.274 --> 08:05.775
because I'm very familiar with
both brazil and israel cuisines.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.987
So I'm hoping I can balance
these flavors together.

08:09.031 --> 08:11.323
Richard: Three, two, one.

08:11.325 --> 08:13.700
How we doing?
You got whatever's left.

08:13.702 --> 08:14.868
Kenny:<i> So I get my wok up.</i>

08:15.162 --> 08:19.164
I've yet to see a chinese/
moroccan fusion restaurant.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.958
I'm gonna be honest. I am not
ready for today's challenge.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.961
Okay, basement,
your 40 minutes starts now.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.256
Let's go, p, baby.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.966
40 minutes.
Make it count, baby.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.177
Two amazing countries,
one beautiful dish,

08:32.221 --> 08:33.887
and two talented chefs
down here.

08:33.889 --> 08:36.139
There's a lot of pressure
being the mentor
in the basement now

08:36.183 --> 08:39.976
because you want to help your
cooks get to the next level.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.354
<i> Pyet and kenny,</i>
<i> they're not from team blais,</i>

08:42.397 --> 08:45.732
<i> but they will directly benefit</i>
<i> from some good mentorship.</i>

08:45.776 --> 08:50.570
So I want pyet and kenny
to get out of the basement now.

08:50.614 --> 08:53.782
Now remember, the first part
of the cook is where
you should be focusing, right?

08:53.825 --> 08:55.075
Formulating a path.

08:55.536 --> 08:58.286
Then leave yourself time
on the back end
to self-edit, critique.

08:58.330 --> 09:01.998
- That needs salt.
- Let's get, get, get it.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.127
40 minutes to, a,
create a next level dish,

09:06.171 --> 09:09.798
but more importantly,
combine two countries
into one, yes?

09:09.841 --> 09:10.924
- Yes.
- Yes, chef.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.259
Don't overcomplicate
those dishes.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.469
This challenge
is all about fusion.

09:14.471 --> 09:17.806
<i>Balancing those amazing flavors</i>
<i> can be incredibly difficult,</i>

09:17.849 --> 09:22.143
but I'm looking for
the next level creative idea.
What have you got?

09:22.187 --> 09:24.104
- Oh, I got Spain.
- So you got Spain?

09:24.147 --> 09:28.316
And japan, so you're doing
a spanish influence across
a japanese influence.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.111
You got a tough one there.
And the protein
is that hamachi, right?

09:31.154 --> 09:32.862
- Hamachi.
- Hamachi. Amazing.

09:32.906 --> 09:33.989
And what's the base
of this dish?

09:34.032 --> 09:38.034
- What's the broth, the sauce?
- Um...

09:42.374 --> 09:44.207
I was trying to figure out
what I wanted to do exactly.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.459
Reuel seemed a little sweaty.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.254
He seems like he's questioning
his dish a little bit.

09:49.298 --> 09:51.923
And what's the starch?
How are you gonna build
this dish out?

09:51.925 --> 09:54.092
Um...

09:54.094 --> 09:55.969
- I'm not sure yet.
- Not sure yet.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.762
Reuel:
<i> Throughout this whole journey,</i>

09:57.806 --> 09:59.889
<i> I've been consistent.</i>
<i> Always up.</i>

09:59.933 --> 10:01.516
And now I'm here.

10:02.811 --> 10:07.147
I have never felt so lost.

10:15.157 --> 10:17.115
So how's the dish
coming together in terms of--

10:17.150 --> 10:18.491
- I'm not sure yet.
- Not sure yet.

10:18.910 --> 10:22.787
Bringing two countries
into one plate really does test
the individuals.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.915
<i> Reuel may be one of</i>
<i>the strongest competitors here,</i>

10:25.959 --> 10:30.712
<i> but this challenge could send</i>
<i>him straight down to the bottom</i>
<i> if he can't figure it out.</i>

10:30.756 --> 10:32.547
So the secret here is
not to use all the ingredients.

10:32.924 --> 10:36.926
It's combining the influences
and bringing that spanish
influence across the japanese.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.679
I'm just gonna do what I do.
Cook.

10:39.723 --> 10:43.975
<i> Hamachi needs to be seared.</i>
<i> Soba needs to be cooked.</i>

10:44.019 --> 10:48.855
I need some sort of broth.
I have bok choy.

10:48.899 --> 10:50.774
<i> Let's start cooking</i>
<i> like I'm used to.</i>

10:50.776 --> 10:53.234
Gordon: Don't allow
that fusion to clash.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.111
Right, mariah.
What did you grab?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.237
- Thai?
- Yes.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.106
- And? Mexico.
- Mexico.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.032
So the protein,
what's the protein?

10:59.284 --> 11:01.660
- My protein are red prawns.
- Beautiful.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.871
I'm gonna do a thai style soup
with influence of mexico.

11:04.915 --> 11:06.790
Good.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.876
I'm making a grilled
red spotted prawn
thai coconut curry soup

11:09.920 --> 11:12.212
<i> topped with</i>
<i> crispy tortilla strips,</i>

11:12.214 --> 11:15.882
<i> some corn with poblano pepper</i>
<i> for my mexican influence.</i>

11:15.926 --> 11:17.842
I need to merge these
successfully

11:17.886 --> 11:19.511
<i> because I gotta stay</i>
<i> in this kitchen.</i>

11:19.513 --> 11:21.054
<i> Like,</i>
<i> I gotta avoid elimination,</i>

11:21.098 --> 11:23.223
so I need to my dish
to be on top.

11:23.266 --> 11:28.019
So five minutes gone.
Just under 35 minutes to go.

11:28.105 --> 11:30.063
Nyesha:
How you doing, chef angie?
What are you thinking, chef?

11:30.107 --> 11:31.856
- I mean, I got great stuff.
- You have great ingredients.
Yes, you do.

11:31.858 --> 11:32.816
Angie: Oh, my god.
I'm just in heaven.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.192
My european ass grabbed Italy
and germany.

11:34.861 --> 11:38.113
I saw you went straight
for that. I said,
"I know where she's going."

11:38.156 --> 11:40.865
I'm italian and german,
so I'm like, "me!"

11:40.909 --> 11:42.283
nyesha:
What's the game plan, chef?

11:42.327 --> 11:44.035
I'm thinking I've got
lots of great ingredients

11:44.079 --> 11:45.954
for a really yummy
veal parmesan.

11:45.997 --> 11:48.456
- Nyesha: Yes.
- I'm gonna make
a veal schnitzel

11:48.458 --> 11:52.919
and a creamy parmesan polenta
with a sauerkraut slaw on top.

11:52.963 --> 11:56.339
- Okay.
- I've never had so much stuff!

11:56.383 --> 11:58.758
Nyesha:
<i> I'm extremely proud of angie.</i>

11:58.802 --> 12:00.677
She's blossoming.
Look, I have to say,

12:00.721 --> 12:02.887
I think she's a dark horse
in this competition.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.390
- Oh, that's a fork.
- Tell me your plan.

12:05.434 --> 12:06.850
So you want to clarify
the butter?

12:07.185 --> 12:10.895
Yes. Sear the duck breast.
Create a gastrique
with the champagne.

12:10.981 --> 12:13.773
I grabbed France and greece.

12:13.817 --> 12:17.986
<i> I'm thinking perhaps I'll make</i>
<i> a seared duck breast</i>

12:18.029 --> 12:21.030
<i> with a celeriac and pea purée</i>

12:21.074 --> 12:25.076
and hopefully make some type
of olive pastry
that you could dip.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.745
Yeah, a gastrique
would be beautiful.

12:26.747 --> 12:27.662
- With the duck.
- With the duck breast.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.789
Makes sense.
Sort of french inspiration.

12:29.833 --> 12:30.957
Tricia:
With the béarnaise sauce,

12:31.001 --> 12:33.042
I'll use the feta cheese, the--

12:33.086 --> 12:34.127
- béarnaise?
- Yeah, béarnaise.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.420
So you have gastrique
and a béarnaise?

12:35.714 --> 12:38.590
- Yes.
- You cannot serve a dish
that has fat on fat.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.592
You're not gonna pair two things
that are very fatty.

12:40.635 --> 12:43.720
- Yes, chef.
- You know what I mean?
Why do you need the béarnaise?

12:43.764 --> 12:45.930
- So gastrique then.
- I think that's smart,
chef, personally.

12:45.974 --> 12:50.226
Chef arrington is not super sure
about my béarnaise sauce.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.354
Quite honestly,
I'm not super sure about
my béarnaise sauce as well,

12:53.356 --> 12:55.815
<i> but I cannot think up</i>
<i> for the life of me</i>

12:55.859 --> 12:57.192
<i> any other sauce I know</i>
<i> at this moment.</i>

12:57.652 --> 13:01.780
I'm just kind of hoping
that whatever I put
on the plate works well.

13:01.823 --> 13:04.407
I was definitely
hoping for that japan basket,
I'm not gonna lie.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.202
Richard: All right,
30 minutes remain.

13:07.204 --> 13:09.037
There's 30 minutes left
in the cook.

13:09.080 --> 13:12.081
You definitely gotta have
one or two of your elements

13:12.083 --> 13:14.250
sort of going here.
All right, pyet.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.086
How is this dish brazilian
and israeli?

13:17.130 --> 13:20.965
So I'm gonna do
a pan seared steak.

13:21.009 --> 13:23.301
I'm gonna make a little tahini
and date sauce.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.845
It smells like your food.
It smells like your kitchen,
you know what I mean?

13:25.889 --> 13:28.348
It is. Cooking like
I'm cooking for my family
right now, chef.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.308
Richard:
Who are you cooking for?

13:30.352 --> 13:32.519
Native-american people
around the country.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.771
You know,
there are a lot of people

13:34.815 --> 13:38.399
from where I come from
that would love to have
an opportunity to do this

13:38.443 --> 13:41.194
<i> and to even just cook</i>
<i> for these mentors,</i>

13:41.238 --> 13:43.112
so I have to
remind myself of that

13:43.114 --> 13:45.573
<i> and really bring all of those</i>
<i> emotions and those feelings</i>

13:45.617 --> 13:47.283
to the forefront when
I'm in the kitchen cooking.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.203
All right, kenny,
china and morocco.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.330
- Morocco.
- So what are you thinking?

13:52.374 --> 13:53.957
You got some spices
working right here.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.959
I'm gonna do
a pork fried rice basically.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.336
So it's gonna be a pomegranate
glazed tenderloin.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.964
A pork fried rice?
That's very chinese.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.757
What else was in that basket
from morocco?

14:02.801 --> 14:05.134
I got couscous,
I got preserved lemons which--

14:05.178 --> 14:06.970
- you got couscous?
- Yes, chef.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.388
When you said pork fried rice,

14:08.390 --> 14:10.139
I was thinking
pork fried couscous.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.766
You can't sound more fusion.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.351
Heard.
Gotta execute today, baby.

14:13.395 --> 14:15.436
- Yeah, you gotta execute.
- Yes, chef.

14:17.065 --> 14:21.025
All right, that's moving, bruh.
Mid-way challenge.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.277
Kenny:
Gotta be a twist, right?

14:23.822 --> 14:28.032
What does every country need
across their cuisine?

14:28.034 --> 14:29.075
Fresh herbs!

14:29.119 --> 14:31.411
Reuel:
<i> I don't want anything else.</i>

14:31.454 --> 14:33.621
Keep it up there.
Keep it all the way up there.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.415
<i> I'm still trying</i>
<i> to figure out my dish.</i>

14:35.458 --> 14:38.877
Flat leaf parsley,
fresh mint, oregano.
Be smart. Thai basil.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.754
Come on. And it's gone.
Say goodbye. Hurry up!

14:41.798 --> 14:44.299
- Hurry up!
- Damn it.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.885
Ladies, platform's here!
Fresh herbs.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.554
Grab your fresh herbs.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.848
Nyesha:
<i>So the mid-round drop is herbs.</i>

14:51.892 --> 14:54.767
<i> It sounds easy, but this</i>
<i> being a fusion challenge,</i>

14:54.769 --> 14:58.146
you have to choose herb
based on the region
that you're cooking.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.272
Is this tarragon?

14:59.524 --> 15:02.066
Nyesha: I want that fragrance
in the dishes, ladies!

15:02.110 --> 15:05.612
If you choose the wrong herb,
it's gonna throw your dish
off completely.

15:05.655 --> 15:09.198
- Ah, this is good one.
- All right, everyone,
here comes the drop.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.326
You gotta grab some herbs.
Fresh herbs.

15:11.369 --> 15:14.621
Take what you need
for your dish.
You gotta grab at least one.

15:14.664 --> 15:18.249
I'm so happy because
every single challenge

15:18.251 --> 15:20.084
I somehow forget
to grab an herb.

15:20.128 --> 15:23.880
Three, two, one.
Thank goodness.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.590
I was really happy about that.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.216
The cilantro,
you knew that was coming.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.343
I got some thai basil.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.845
And you got some basil. Okay.

15:30.889 --> 15:33.806
25 minutes left.
Only 25 minutes.

15:33.850 --> 15:37.894
- Mentally, we're editing.
- What's the game plan, chef?

15:37.938 --> 15:40.021
I grabbed india,
and I grabbed vietnam.

15:40.065 --> 15:42.315
So I'm gonna do
a chicken curry, I'm pretty
sure some kind of purée.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.275
This is the second time
we're seeing curry.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.027
But different.
Different type of curry.

15:46.071 --> 15:48.905
- How so?
- Because I have
fresher ingredients...

15:48.940 --> 15:50.990
- Yes.
- ...Versus just the spices.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.909
Nyesha: Excellent.
I'm gonna pull your butter off.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.369
- It's ready to go, okay?
- Oh, yes, chef.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.579
The clarified butter
is also for my béarnaise.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.498
- So you are making
a béarnaise sauce?
- Yes, chef.

15:58.500 --> 16:02.961
I don't know if it's because
I'm not tricia's original mentor

16:02.963 --> 16:04.754
that she's not taking my advice,

16:04.798 --> 16:06.965
<i> but I want to see her</i>
<i> do her best.</i>

16:06.967 --> 16:09.384
<i> Tricia is cooking</i>
<i> from a place of fear,</i>

16:09.419 --> 16:11.803
<i> and it's going to end up</i>
<i> in the death of a dish.</i>

16:11.846 --> 16:14.514
Don't overcomplicate.
You don't need too many
components, okay?

16:14.557 --> 16:15.890
- Yes, chef.
- You're talking gastrique,

16:15.934 --> 16:17.591
you're talking béarnaise,
you're talking--

16:17.644 --> 16:19.185
- it's a lot.
- Make sure it makes sense

16:19.229 --> 16:21.312
and that you're tasting
everything together, okay?

16:21.356 --> 16:22.814
Yes, chef.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.190
Nyesha: Stop.
Leave it there.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.778
Thank you, chef.
Sorry, chef.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.531
Tricia, chef arrington would
like her hair on her arms.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.366
Okay, thank you, courtney.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.201
Tricia:
<i> Not again, tricia.</i>

16:35.203 --> 16:37.829
Fire in the basement!

16:37.872 --> 16:41.124
- Watch out!
- What is wrong with me?

16:41.167 --> 16:44.877
You are really determined
to light these fires
in this kitchen, aren't you?

16:44.921 --> 16:47.588
( bleep ) my life.

16:47.632 --> 16:50.008
Nyesha:<i> I'm done.</i>
<i> I'm frustrated with tricia</i>

16:50.051 --> 16:52.343
because she's not rising
to her full potential.

16:52.345 --> 16:56.097
- Yes, chef?
- Tricia, let's go.
This is ( bleep ).

16:56.099 --> 16:58.224
- Yes, chef.
- Cook better! Focus!

16:58.268 --> 17:01.019
This is not next level cooking,
do you understand?

17:01.062 --> 17:02.353
- Yes, chef.
- It's not a game.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.355
This is not about pretty photos.

17:04.399 --> 17:06.107
Yes, chef.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.819
- What?
- ...Was that?

17:09.863 --> 17:11.279
- Nyesha: Let's go!
- What's burning?

17:11.322 --> 17:12.447
( bleep )

17:15.118 --> 17:18.161
- tricia, this is not
next level cooking.
- Yes, chef.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.666
- What?
- ...Was that?

17:23.710 --> 17:27.253
- I want nothing part of that.
- What's burning?

17:27.297 --> 17:30.048
What the ( bleep )?
What's burning?

17:30.091 --> 17:31.466
- Bounce back.
- Yes, chef.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.218
I know you can do this.
I'm tough on you because
I believe in you, okay?

17:34.262 --> 17:35.094
Yes, chef.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.554
Tricia:
<i> I know I'm better than this.</i>

17:36.598 --> 17:38.306
<i> Chef arrington knows</i>
<i> I'm better than this.</i>

17:38.475 --> 17:43.102
I'm hoping that the mentors
are able to overlook
the fire in the kitchen

17:43.146 --> 17:45.104
<i> and focus on the flavors</i>
<i> on my plate</i>

17:45.148 --> 17:47.148
because I am confident
in my flavors.

17:47.192 --> 17:49.317
- Do you know you can do this?
- Yes, chef.

17:49.360 --> 17:52.070
Game day, baby.
How's your veal cooked, chef?

17:52.072 --> 17:54.363
- It's perfect. Yes.
- Seasoned?

17:54.365 --> 17:55.531
You seasoned the veal
before your breaded it?

17:55.533 --> 17:56.783
- Oh, yes.
- Great.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.993
How else are
we building flavor here?
Do you have some cheese?

17:59.079 --> 18:00.536
Yes, I did put some parm
in there.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.580
Nyesha: Make sure you cook
that cream through.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.791
- Angie: Yeah.
- You don't want it
to taste too raw.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.084
Yes, chef.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.002
15 minutes left.

18:08.046 --> 18:09.170
How you doing over there, kenny?

18:09.214 --> 18:10.338
I'm good, mama.
How about yourself, baby?

18:10.340 --> 18:12.548
- I'm good.
- Ooh, what's this?

18:12.592 --> 18:14.258
- Sweet potato, dates.
- That's the sweet potato date?

18:14.260 --> 18:17.011
And the tahini.
Something's missing.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.971
<i> I'm very worried</i>
<i> about the sauce.</i>

18:19.015 --> 18:20.515
It's not turning out the way
that I want it to.

18:20.558 --> 18:21.682
<i> At this point,</i>
<i> it's the only thing</i>

18:22.018 --> 18:25.103
<i> that's really tying in</i>
<i> the two countries together.</i>

18:25.146 --> 18:26.854
It needs some more sweetness.
More.

18:26.898 --> 18:29.232
You know, well, let's try
and open up that coconut milk

18:29.234 --> 18:32.026
because the tahini
and the coconut, to me,

18:32.070 --> 18:33.444
- that sounds exciting.
- Heard, chef.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.445
You're standing
on a lot of shoulders

18:34.697 --> 18:35.446
and you got a lot
of people looking up to you.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.574
So no pressure.
Let's get out of this basement.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.035
- What is that right there?
- Pomegranate molasses.
I'ma glaze my tenderloin.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.537
- Okay, that's really sweet.
- Yes, chef.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.790
- Okay, just be mindful.
That's really, really sweet.
- Kenny: Heard.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.917
Richard:
<i> I think this is the toughest</i>
<i> challenge we've had so far,</i>

18:47.961 --> 18:50.169
<i> because you don't have</i>
<i> the resources,</i>

18:50.213 --> 18:53.131
<i> ingredient-wise or equipment,</i>
<i> as always in the basement,</i>

18:53.133 --> 18:54.715
but now you have
to create something

18:54.759 --> 18:57.468
that combines a couple
of different cultures.
This is a lot.

18:57.512 --> 19:01.264
You got two countries
fused together to make
one amazing dish.

19:01.307 --> 19:04.058
- Yes, chef. For sure.
- Let's get out of the basement.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.979
Gordon:
So just under 12 minutes
to go, guys, yes?

19:08.022 --> 19:10.231
Right, how we feeling now?
We feeling better?

19:10.233 --> 19:11.899
- Kind of, chef.
- Yeah? Good.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.068
- Toasting your almonds?
- Chef.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.486
Good.
And where's your hamachi?

19:15.530 --> 19:17.864
That's it there? Good.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.699
Right, how long is that broth
gonna be cooking for?

19:19.742 --> 19:22.034
- I have in there
for 20 minutes.
- 20 minutes. Good.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.369
Is this is gonna be
a sweet curry,

19:23.413 --> 19:25.079
or are you gonna go
for sweet, spicy, sour--

19:25.114 --> 19:26.330
- sweet, spicy, sour.
- Good.

19:26.374 --> 19:28.249
I'm gonna do, like,
a coconut red curry base.

19:28.293 --> 19:30.168
It's something that I've had
when I went to thailand.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.878
I love international
cuisine, chef.

19:31.921 --> 19:35.590
I spent five years
flying internationally
as a flight attendant.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.717
<i> Traveling is definitely</i>
<i> an advantage for me</i>

19:37.760 --> 19:39.886
<i> in this competition,</i>
<i> especially for fusion.</i>

19:39.929 --> 19:43.014
<i> That's the expectation,</i>
<i> is to know how to merge</i>
<i> these two flavors together.</i>

19:43.057 --> 19:46.350
And if you've never tasted
something from another country,
how would you know?

19:46.352 --> 19:49.604
You don't seem to be fazed
by pressure, do you?

19:49.689 --> 19:50.521
My whole life has been
nothing but pressure, chef.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.148
- Really?
- Yes.

19:52.567 --> 19:55.318
- It doesn't look like that it
in the kitchen, you know that?
- I'm like a duck.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.321
I look calm,
but I'm pedaling like hell
underneath the water.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.530
In this competition so far,

19:59.574 --> 20:01.741
<i> mariah has always</i>
<i> been one to watch.</i>

20:01.784 --> 20:05.119
<i> She's damn good. Yeah,</i>
<i> she's on a different level.</i>

20:05.163 --> 20:07.538
You got two great baskets.
Do it justice, yes?

20:07.582 --> 20:09.081
Yes, chef.

20:10.201 --> 20:12.084
- Ten minutes left, right?
- Yes, chef!

20:12.128 --> 20:13.544
- Thank you, chef.
- Power time.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.755
All right, courtney. Calm.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.215
- Chef courtney?
- Yes, chef?

20:17.217 --> 20:19.759
- What do we have in this pot?
- We have garbanzo beans

20:19.802 --> 20:22.136
and the cauliflower's going
in there as cream in there.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.387
Beautiful.
Did you restart your curry?

20:23.431 --> 20:25.348
I did because I forgot
my coconut milk.

20:25.350 --> 20:28.059
Last time I made it
with heavy whipping cream,

20:28.102 --> 20:29.227
and I want you all to taste it
with coconut milk.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.020
- Chef.
- Thank you.

20:31.022 --> 20:33.689
<i> As somebody</i>
<i> who is self-taught,</i>

20:33.733 --> 20:38.444
to come this far is--
it's a major accomplishment.

20:38.488 --> 20:39.737
Okay.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.530
<i> There are only seven of us,</i>

20:41.532 --> 20:42.823
<i> so this really</i>
<i> needs to be perfect.</i>

20:43.159 --> 20:47.828
At this point,
a small mistake can catapult you
to the basement.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.330
I don't wanna be there.

20:49.374 --> 20:52.333
- You gather yourself, tricia?
- Yes, chef.

20:52.335 --> 20:53.960
Calm your heartbeat.
Breathe through your nose.

20:53.962 --> 20:55.836
Heartbeat is pretty insane.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.964
- This is the time
to level up, chef.
- Yes, chef.

20:57.966 --> 21:00.341
Bring these plates
together, guys!

21:00.385 --> 21:03.386
We're down to three minutes
to go, guys.

21:04.347 --> 21:07.306
- Components ready? Yeah.
- Good.

21:07.350 --> 21:10.559
Some dishes you have to
pull out of your ass.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.061
So I just took my noodles.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.354
They're dripping
from the hamachi.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.982
Tossed it in there
to make sure they're seasoned.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.317
I did a charred shishito

21:18.361 --> 21:21.946
and I put the saffron
and paprika in the broth.

21:21.990 --> 21:23.239
- For the spanish influence?
- Yes.

21:23.241 --> 21:25.658
This is it now.
Finishing touches now. Herbs.

21:25.702 --> 21:28.119
- Taste everything, guys.
Come on.
- Yes, chef.

21:29.163 --> 21:31.247
It's time to plate.
Two minutes left.

21:31.249 --> 21:34.125
Is it seasoned well?
Does it look beautiful?

21:34.168 --> 21:36.836
Oh, ( bleep ) yeah.
Perfect.

21:36.879 --> 21:38.004
Let's get our asses
out of the basement, kenny.

21:38.047 --> 21:41.048
- For sure. No choice.
- Let's do it.

21:41.092 --> 21:43.092
Come on, ladies.
Let's get it.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.927
Nyesha:
Best plates, no excuses!

21:44.971 --> 21:46.804
Flavor, fat, excellence.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.764
Where's my parm? I'm looking
for my parm and my grater.

21:48.808 --> 21:52.059
- Ah!
- Platform arrives, guys.
Let's go!

21:52.061 --> 21:54.770
Platform's on the move, guys.
Platform's on the move.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.188
Platform's coming down.

21:56.274 --> 21:59.608
15 seconds, guys!
We gotta get to the platform!

21:59.652 --> 22:00.568
Come on!
Let's get out of this basement!

22:00.820 --> 22:02.403
Let's get the ( bleep )
out of this hole.

22:02.447 --> 22:05.448
Seven, six, five,

22:05.450 --> 22:06.532
four, three, two...

22:06.576 --> 22:07.950
( bleep )

22:07.952 --> 22:11.245
one. Last looks!
Last looks!

22:12.832 --> 22:14.498
That plating
was ( bleep ) garbage.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.000
Flavors, baby. Flavors.

22:16.044 --> 22:19.003
Get your plates up there!
Bring this home!

22:19.047 --> 22:23.966
Five, four, three, two, one.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.302
Good job. Way to fight!

22:28.264 --> 22:31.182
Gordon: Here we go, guys.
Come on, guys, please.

22:31.225 --> 22:36.395
Five, four, three, two, one.

22:37.482 --> 22:38.314
Oh, my goodness me.

22:39.567 --> 22:42.985
- I figured it out.
- We'll see about that
in the taste.

22:45.823 --> 22:46.989
I'm sorry, chef.

22:49.827 --> 22:50.910
It's not easy, right?

22:50.995 --> 22:53.120
- I can do way better than this.
- You can.

22:53.164 --> 22:57.249
I watched you cook on that top
level the first day that you
entered this competition.

22:57.293 --> 22:59.251
My mind was
all over the place today,

22:59.295 --> 23:02.088
<i>but I have a lot left to prove.</i>

23:02.090 --> 23:04.215
I'm fighting for myself,

23:04.217 --> 23:07.301
<i> my followers, my family.</i>

23:07.345 --> 23:09.887
I really want to show
that I can succeed

23:09.931 --> 23:11.972
<i> as a social media chef.</i>

23:12.016 --> 23:15.226
- Trust yourself.
- Yes, chef.

23:25.988 --> 23:28.322
Gordon: Okay, that was
a very tough challenge.

23:28.366 --> 23:32.243
I just hope all of you
created a fusion dish,

23:32.245 --> 23:34.328
- not a confusion.
- Absolutely.

23:34.372 --> 23:36.330
Based on what we taste today,

23:36.374 --> 23:38.290
the best dishes
are gonna be safe,

23:38.334 --> 23:40.459
and move up to that top kitchen
for the next challenge.

23:40.503 --> 23:43.671
The middle dishes
will also be safe and move
to the second floor.

23:43.673 --> 23:47.883
And the worst dishes today
will all cook in
the elimination challenge,

23:47.885 --> 23:49.969
and one of you
will be going home.

23:50.012 --> 23:53.055
There's a lot at stake here.
$250,000.

23:53.099 --> 23:56.392
- Right, shall we, nyesha?
- Yes, chef.

23:57.854 --> 24:00.271
Richard: Okay,
so this dish right here,

24:00.273 --> 24:03.357
the chef had to use china
and morocco

24:03.401 --> 24:07.319
and did a sweet and sour
pork fried couscous.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.738
Gordon: So visually
it looks rather plain.

24:14.912 --> 24:19.206
It's a shame because
it's undercooked underneath
and cooked nicely on top.

24:19.208 --> 24:23.085
But really sweet.
Really sweet.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.212
Yes, I mean, it's really
wiping out a lot of the flavors

24:25.256 --> 24:28.174
that were intended,
I imagine, for this dish.

24:30.386 --> 24:33.304
Richard: Okay, so this chef
had the tough task

24:33.306 --> 24:36.348
of combining brazil and israel

24:36.392 --> 24:39.935
and did an achiote rubbed
skirt steak

24:39.979 --> 24:42.771
with black beans,
a pineapple salsa,

24:42.815 --> 24:45.900
and a tahini
coconut date sauce.

24:45.943 --> 24:48.235
Yeah, visually,
let's be honest,

24:48.237 --> 24:50.905
the steak's actually cut
the wrong way.

24:50.948 --> 24:54.116
Oh, great. Pyet's going home
because she doesn't know
how to cut a steak.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.910
<i> I'm very worried</i>
<i> at this point.</i>

24:55.953 --> 24:57.995
Nyesha:
Conceptually, great ideas.

24:58.039 --> 25:03.125
I really like the flavor
of the sort of tahini
coconut date sauce.

25:03.127 --> 25:06.462
- Use some salt.
- For me, it actually tasted
better than it looked.

25:06.506 --> 25:09.256
When you expose
protein like that,
it needs seasoning inside,

25:09.300 --> 25:11.550
but the date purée works well.

25:12.970 --> 25:14.303
Right, shall we move
to the middle floor?

25:14.305 --> 25:16.138
Nyesha: Yes.
We have a veal schnitzel.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.557
The inspiration behind this dish

25:18.601 --> 25:20.684
was germany and Italy.

25:20.728 --> 25:24.897
This has a shaved cabbage salad
with a soft polenta.

25:24.941 --> 25:27.191
Please taste good,
please taste good,
please taste good.

25:27.235 --> 25:32.571
This is the kind of dish
that any professional chef
with a german mum

25:32.615 --> 25:36.784
and an italian father would be
proud to put on their plate.

25:36.786 --> 25:39.870
The polentas,
you wanna dive into that thing
and smother it all over.

25:39.914 --> 25:42.289
And the cook on the veal
is exceptional.

25:42.333 --> 25:45.960
That is next level fusion.

25:46.003 --> 25:46.961
It tastes as good
as it looks, right?

25:47.213 --> 25:54.677
When we talk about soul
and love in a dish,

25:57.390 --> 26:05.104
so here we have
a chicken breast.

26:05.147 --> 26:09.149
This chef had ingredients
from india and vietnam.

26:12.113 --> 26:14.905
Curry's beautiful.
Fragrant, not too spicy.

26:14.949 --> 26:16.574
The chicken's
slightly overcooked.

26:16.659 --> 26:19.159
Nyesha:
I would've loved to see
more of the sauce,

26:19.161 --> 26:23.622
because that sauce
was so delicious her

26:23.666 --> 26:26.667
bs, right?
Nyesha:
I would've loved to see
more of the sauce,

26:26.711 --> 26:30.212
both of these countries
share some herbs in common.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.381
I would've loved all the flavors
to come together.

26:32.383 --> 26:35.050
Courtney:<i> The competition</i>
<i> is definitely getting hard,</i>

26:35.094 --> 26:37.052
and I know it seems
like nitpicking,

26:37.096 --> 26:39.763
but when you're talking
about $250,000

26:39.765 --> 26:42.099
and you're talking about
mentorship from three people,

26:42.101 --> 26:45.769
nitpicking is
what's going to separate

26:45.813 --> 26:47.730
<i> the top from the bottom.</i>

26:47.773 --> 26:52.151
Nyesha: This chef cooked
through France and greece.

26:52.194 --> 26:54.987
This is a roasted duck
sort of cut

26:55.031 --> 26:57.031
with a béarnaise sauce.

27:01.537 --> 27:04.163
The hardest part of this dish
has been done perfectly.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.372
The duck is cooked beautifully.

27:05.750 --> 27:09.293
But a béarnaise with duck in
any world is never gonna work.

27:09.337 --> 27:11.920
Nyesha: It was very challenging
even to get to this point.

27:11.922 --> 27:14.798
I advised exactly
what you're saying, chef.

27:14.842 --> 27:17.134
I feel like ( bleep ).

27:17.178 --> 27:18.886
<i> I know what I did,</i>

27:18.929 --> 27:21.096
and I just have to own it,
I guess.

27:22.391 --> 27:23.849
Top floor.

27:23.893 --> 27:26.185
So this is predominantly thai

27:26.228 --> 27:28.354
with a mexican influence.

27:28.397 --> 27:31.357
There's a broth that was done
in the pressure cooker.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.109
Vermicelli noodles.
The shells were grilled.

27:34.111 --> 27:38.155
This tastes like it was
cooked overnight. It tastes like
it was cooked on the beach.

27:38.199 --> 27:42.159
I don't care
if the beach is in thailand
or if the beach is in mexico,

27:42.161 --> 27:44.078
and I love this sort of,
like, thai broth

27:44.121 --> 27:46.246
with this mexican pozole garnish

27:46.248 --> 27:48.916
with all crunchy cabbage
and tortillas.

27:48.959 --> 27:52.086
It's powerful.
It's oozing confidence.

27:52.129 --> 27:54.129
Nyesha: Absolutely.
It's just smart.

27:54.131 --> 27:57.800
The amount of flavor
that was able to be built
in one bowl in 40 minutes?

27:57.843 --> 28:00.427
Impressive.
That's some next level
( bleep ) right there.

28:00.429 --> 28:02.179
Oh, my god.

28:02.264 --> 28:04.431
Oh, where'd that come from?

28:04.433 --> 28:06.350
But okay! All right.

28:06.394 --> 28:08.102
Gordon:
So this is a hamachi.

28:08.145 --> 28:09.886
The base is
the japanese influence

28:09.897 --> 28:13.190
with a sprinkle
of a spanish flair.

28:13.234 --> 28:15.818
Hamachi, unfortunately,
it hasn't cooked

28:15.820 --> 28:19.196
into the center,
and that's raw.

28:20.950 --> 28:23.617
Smart choice with japan.
Smart out of the gate.

28:23.661 --> 28:26.245
You got to put Spain in there,
you shot yourself in the foot.

28:26.280 --> 28:28.205
So it's more confusion
than fusion.

28:28.207 --> 28:31.375
Noodles way overcooked, but I'm
not feeling good about this.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.877
This dish is extremely clunky
to eat.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.922
It's just difficult
to understand
how to enjoy this dish.

28:36.966 --> 28:39.758
My, my, my,
how the mighty has fallen.
That's the best I can say.

28:39.802 --> 28:42.678
<i> Every dog has its day.</i>
<i> Today just wasn't mine.</i>

28:42.722 --> 28:46.140
All of you, give us a moment
please, because we've got
some tough decisions.

28:46.183 --> 28:48.016
What a tough night.

28:48.018 --> 28:51.311
Well, I'm for sure going
in the elimination challenge.

28:51.355 --> 28:52.521
Oh, my gosh.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.149
Some cracking highlights.

28:55.234 --> 28:59.019
- The germany
versus italian flair?
- Nyesha: Epic.

28:59.029 --> 29:01.196
40 minutes to cook a curry,
that's a tall order.

29:01.198 --> 29:04.783
And bringing
the indian influence
with vietnam?

29:04.827 --> 29:06.618
- Yeah, that sauce was killer.
- Yeah.

29:06.662 --> 29:09.872
The combination of thailand
and the mexican influence...

29:09.915 --> 29:13.876
That's the prime example
of how to meld two regions
of the world together.

29:13.878 --> 29:15.753
The underwhelming performances?

29:15.796 --> 29:19.256
The japanese
with the spanish flair,
that just didn't work.

29:19.258 --> 29:23.302
That, for me,
was this individual's
weakest performance.

29:23.345 --> 29:26.263
I'm assuming that
that was mariah's dish, right?

29:26.265 --> 29:30.100
No. The actual dish
was cooked by reuel.

29:30.144 --> 29:32.227
- I'm sorry, reuel.
- It's all good.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.437
And that duck, I mean...

29:33.522 --> 29:35.230
Richard: The duck,
just a wasted opportunity.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.691
That's tricia. I know
she's your team member as well.

29:37.735 --> 29:40.903
- And reuel.
- Listen, kenny,
he's in the basement.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.196
He's got morocco and china.

29:42.198 --> 29:45.324
He's got a great idea,
but he didn't execute it.

29:45.367 --> 29:47.701
It's all pomegranate molasses.
It's all sweetness.

29:47.745 --> 29:50.621
Yeah, but hold on a minute.
Now you guys are confusing me,

29:50.664 --> 29:53.415
because everybody I've mentored
in this competition
is going into elimination?

29:53.459 --> 29:56.084
Are you kidding me?
You're sandbagging me here.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.337
I mean, come on.
Brazil, israel? Come on.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.631
Are we saying
'cause they're in the basement,
they've got no choice?

30:00.674 --> 30:02.049
- You don't pick
those two cultures.
- Exactly.

30:02.134 --> 30:05.385
No, no. That being said,
the flavors on that dish

30:05.429 --> 30:10.057
were not as bad as reuel's
or kenny's or tricia's duck.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.226
Nyesha: I feel like those were
the least performing dishes

30:12.228 --> 30:14.228
to highlight two regions
of the world.

30:14.230 --> 30:17.272
( bleep ) hell.
( bleep ) me.

30:17.274 --> 30:20.025
Really? This is ( bleep ).

30:24.281 --> 30:27.908
Reuel, kenny, tricia,
bottom three dishes, right?

30:27.952 --> 30:29.368
Nyesha:
No, you're not wrong.

30:29.411 --> 30:30.869
Richard: I mean, listen, listen.
This is not cumulative.

30:30.871 --> 30:32.996
- You're only as good
as your last dish.
- I get it.

30:32.998 --> 30:38.210
It is about your last dish,
but I didn't expect this.
Shall we?

30:42.967 --> 30:45.634
Fusion, we know
was never gonna be easy.

30:45.678 --> 30:48.220
Neither was what we just
went through back there.

30:48.222 --> 30:51.306
We are definitely
not in agreement today.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.184
However we have come
to a consensus.

30:54.228 --> 30:58.313
Two dishes stood out
in today's challenge.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.858
The first...

31:00.901 --> 31:04.486
Was the thai/mexican fusion
with red prawns.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.113
Thank you.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.199
The second dish
that stood out...

31:10.953 --> 31:13.120
...Was the italian/german fusion

31:13.163 --> 31:17.040
of the veal schnitzel
with soft polenta.

31:17.084 --> 31:20.210
- Mariah, congratulations
on staying on the top level.
- Good job.

31:20.254 --> 31:24.089
- Oh, my god.
Thank you so much.
- Congratulations.

31:24.133 --> 31:25.674
And, angie, well done.
You've climbed.

31:25.718 --> 31:28.093
- Thank you, chef.
- You've made it to the top.

31:28.137 --> 31:29.553
Now the question is
can you stay there?

31:29.597 --> 31:31.221
Yes, sir, I can.

31:31.265 --> 31:33.223
<i> I've knocked reuel</i>
<i> out of the top.</i>

31:33.267 --> 31:36.894
I went from basement
to middle to damn at the top.

31:36.937 --> 31:39.229
I'm next level chef.
This is how it's done.

31:39.273 --> 31:41.773
And two dishes deserve to be
in the middle today.

31:41.817 --> 31:46.278
The first, it's the indian/
vietnamese fusion,

31:46.322 --> 31:48.322
- the chicken breast.
- Thank you.

31:48.365 --> 31:50.407
The second dish that made it
to the middle level...

31:54.038 --> 31:56.747
...Was the brazilian/
israeli fusion.

31:56.749 --> 32:00.751
You may be surprised, pyet,
but the flavors on that dish
were excellent.

32:00.794 --> 32:02.544
Thank you, chefs.

32:02.588 --> 32:05.255
So that means that reuel,

32:05.257 --> 32:08.800
tricia, and kenny have
been dropped to the basement,

32:08.844 --> 32:12.304
and all three of you will be
cooking in the elimination.

32:12.348 --> 32:14.473
For the rest of you,
you can head to the lift,

32:14.516 --> 32:16.558
and these three will meet you
in the top kitchen soon.

32:16.602 --> 32:20.020
Reuel:
<i> This is the first time that</i>
<i> I'm going to  elimination.</i>

32:20.064 --> 32:22.064
When my back's against the wall,
I get real focused,

32:22.107 --> 32:25.233
so it's 20/20 vision
at this point in time.

32:25.235 --> 32:27.069
- Good job, guys.
- Thank you.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.987
- You got this.
- You got it, girl.

32:29.031 --> 32:30.781
Kenny:
<i> I'm in an elimination</i>
<i> challenge again,</i>

32:30.824 --> 32:32.199
<i> two challenges back-to-back.</i>

32:32.368 --> 32:35.202
I'm pissed off,
I'm disappointed,
but it's all at myself.

32:35.204 --> 32:37.245
<i> But there's no excuses.</i>

32:37.247 --> 32:39.289
- Team ramsay.
- Team ramsay, huh?

32:39.333 --> 32:41.583
Tricia:<i> I'm embarrassed</i>
<i> with what I put on the plate.</i>

32:41.627 --> 32:44.252
I'm not surprised that
I'm going to elimination.

32:44.254 --> 32:45.587
It is the first time.

32:45.631 --> 32:48.090
But I have to admit,
I'm a little scared

32:48.133 --> 32:51.760
'cause I am going against
two professional chefs.

32:51.804 --> 32:55.222
To say that I'm disappointed
is an understatement.

32:55.224 --> 32:57.224
Now tonight you'll have
one last chance

32:57.267 --> 32:59.476
to earn your way
back into the competition.

32:59.520 --> 33:03.480
Chef nyesha arrington will be
in that kitchen with you

33:03.524 --> 33:04.982
across those 30 minutes.

33:05.067 --> 33:09.361
And trust me, you're gonna need
her more than you'll need me

33:09.363 --> 33:11.780
because tonight's
elimination cook-off

33:11.824 --> 33:16.118
is based on the extraordinary
background of chef arrington.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.578
Tonight you'll be cooking
a fusion dish

33:18.622 --> 33:22.749
of korean and good old
american southern cuisine.

33:22.793 --> 33:25.669
This elimination cook-off
is very close to my heart.

33:25.713 --> 33:29.881
This celebrates my heritage
of korean from my mom's side

33:29.967 --> 33:32.050
<i> and the southern roots</i>
<i> of my dad's side.</i>

33:32.094 --> 33:35.262
This is what
has shaped my palate,
so it's very close to home.

33:35.264 --> 33:38.098
All of you,
head into the lift,
and good luck.

33:38.142 --> 33:40.392
Chef nyesha
will meet you upstairs.

33:42.604 --> 33:44.229
Kenny:
<i> Chef tricia, chef reuel,</i>
<i> and myself, like,</i>

33:44.273 --> 33:46.106
we've been together pretty much
this whole journey.

33:46.150 --> 33:48.442
- I love you guys.
- Right back at you.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.987
We've all made
each other better.

33:52.072 --> 33:55.073
So it's unfortunate we gotta go
head-to-head at this point.

33:59.246 --> 34:01.246
- This is intense.
- Mm-hmm.

34:01.248 --> 34:03.915
I'm gonna stay
in this competition by putting
my best foot forward.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.709
<i> I'm gonna channel everything</i>
<i> that I know,</i>

34:05.753 --> 34:09.421
make sure I play
with flavors properly,
and come out to kill it.

34:09.465 --> 34:11.673
This cook means a lot to me.
It's personal.

34:11.759 --> 34:15.302
I want to see today
dishes that are korean forward

34:15.345 --> 34:18.889
with that sort of southern hug,
that soul from the back end.

34:18.932 --> 34:19.890
Yes, chef.

34:19.933 --> 34:21.808
Line up at the elevator, please.

34:21.852 --> 34:22.893
- Let's cheer them on, team.
- Let's go, tricia.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.603
Trish, good luck.
Kenny, good luck.

34:24.605 --> 34:27.773
- Platform's coming, guys.
- Ooh, beautiful.

34:27.816 --> 34:31.902
- Go! 30 minutes.
- Oh, my god.

34:31.945 --> 34:33.779
Nyesha:
Fight for what you deserve.

34:33.822 --> 34:35.363
Oh, thank god.

34:35.365 --> 34:38.241
<i> Finally something good is</i>
<i> happening from this platform.</i>

34:38.285 --> 34:40.702
<i> There's gochujang,</i>
<i> there's soy sauce! Oh, my god.</i>

34:40.746 --> 34:42.621
I haven't had this
since the beginning
of the competition.

34:42.664 --> 34:44.081
- Trish?
- Yeah?

34:44.333 --> 34:47.542
- Wanna borrow some of that
gochujang from you.
- Absolutely.

34:50.923 --> 34:52.089
Tricia, what are you
thinking, babe?

34:52.132 --> 34:54.049
- I got this.
- I believe in you.

34:54.051 --> 34:56.885
- What's your plan, chef?
- I'ma do a korean barbeque
on my strip.

34:56.929 --> 34:59.012
Nyesha: What flavors are you
adding on your new york strip?

34:59.056 --> 35:02.224
It's more of a gochujang
barbeque sauce with steak.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.350
Excellent.
What's your southern influence?

35:03.352 --> 35:05.185
My potato purée,
and I got my okra.

35:05.229 --> 35:07.270
I gonna pan sear,
and then I'ma do a spiced pear.

35:07.314 --> 35:08.146
Smart using a pear.

35:08.398 --> 35:10.023
I made a mistake
in the main challenge.

35:10.067 --> 35:11.525
<i> I didn't taste</i>
<i> everything together.</i>

35:11.568 --> 35:12.818
<i> My dish was too sweet.</i>

35:12.861 --> 35:15.153
As someone who's fighting
for $250,000,

35:15.197 --> 35:16.863
there's no excuses.

35:16.907 --> 35:18.323
I'm down?

35:18.325 --> 35:20.242
"get your ass up." simple.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.702
- Borrowing some gochujang?
- Got it.

35:22.746 --> 35:24.788
Nyesha: What's your plan,
chef reuel?

35:24.832 --> 35:27.332
I'm going to do
kimchi fried rice.

35:27.334 --> 35:28.333
Nice. It sounds delicious.

35:28.627 --> 35:31.253
It's gonna go with a little bit
of the andouille.

35:31.296 --> 35:32.671
- Okay.
- The kimchi fried rice I get

35:33.048 --> 35:37.092
usually has this
ground pork sausage in there
that you can barely see.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.594
<i> And today,</i>
<i> this is a take on it.</i>

35:39.638 --> 35:41.221
<i> For all them times</i>
<i> I've been ordering that</i>

35:41.223 --> 35:43.348
<i> and having it be delivered,</i>
<i> I said,</i>

35:43.350 --> 35:46.518
"praise jesus!
Today's the day."

35:46.603 --> 35:48.937
what are your aromatics
in your kimchi fried rice, chef?

35:48.981 --> 35:52.566
- Ginger, garlic.
- Excellent. Great start.

35:52.568 --> 35:54.192
Nice.

35:54.236 --> 35:56.194
Those are nice cuts, reuel.

35:56.196 --> 35:57.279
What's your plan, chef?

35:57.322 --> 35:59.489
I'm going to make a dak-galbi.

35:59.533 --> 36:01.199
<i> I'm making dak-galbi,</i>

36:01.243 --> 36:02.868
which is a spicy
marinated chicken.

36:02.911 --> 36:04.119
<i> It's so delicious.</i>

36:04.163 --> 36:05.829
What's your plan
with the chicken?

36:05.873 --> 36:07.706
Into small pieces, chef,
for the dak-galbi.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.124
- Nyesha: Bounce back, okay?
- Yes, chef.

36:09.126 --> 36:11.242
Nyesha:
Just over 20 minutes left!

36:11.253 --> 36:14.087
You're seasoning this
along the way, right?

36:14.131 --> 36:16.756
- Kenny: Heard, chef.
- Nyesha: Very important.
Season it in layers, right?

36:16.800 --> 36:19.259
- Don't wait till
the end to season.
- Absolutely, chef.

36:19.303 --> 36:22.721
I don't know what she's making,
but I'm intrigued.

36:22.764 --> 36:26.558
- I'm very intrigued.
- Nyesha: Let's go, guys!

36:26.560 --> 36:28.018
Tricia: Oh, my god.

36:28.061 --> 36:29.311
Nyesha:
Tricia, get it together.

36:29.354 --> 36:32.397
Flames.
Tricia's station is flames.

36:32.441 --> 36:34.316
- Come on, tricia, focus.
- Oh, ( bleep ).

36:34.359 --> 36:37.319
Tricia, why are you
doing this to me?

36:43.035 --> 36:46.119
Tricia, why are you
doing this to me?

36:46.163 --> 36:49.623
Intentional fire, I swear.

36:49.666 --> 36:52.542
<i> Maybe I took on</i>
<i> a more difficult challenge</i>
<i> than I should have,</i>

36:52.586 --> 36:54.961
but the components
seem to be coming together.

36:55.005 --> 36:57.714
<i>I'm feeling good about my dish.</i>

36:57.758 --> 36:59.216
Nyesha: You need to sear this
on the fat side as well, okay?

36:59.259 --> 37:01.885
- Yes, chef.
- What do you have
in this pot here?

37:01.929 --> 37:03.678
Leeks.
I'm gonna put my potatoes
in there as well.

37:03.722 --> 37:04.596
Nyesha: How are you
building flavor in this?

37:04.890 --> 37:07.057
I was gonna let it
cook down some, chef.

37:07.100 --> 37:09.059
- More like a stew-like.
Yes, chef.
- Yes. Okay.

37:09.102 --> 37:12.229
Calculate the next ten minutes
of your life, guys!

37:12.231 --> 37:14.981
For one of you,
it's the last ten minutes!

37:15.025 --> 37:16.608
Make it count.

37:16.610 --> 37:18.902
- You're cooking
this again, right?
- Yes, chef.

37:18.946 --> 37:21.071
Nyesha: You wanna bring
the temperature down
of your rice

37:21.114 --> 37:22.739
so it doesn't continue
to cook, right?

37:22.783 --> 37:25.158
- Yes, chef.
- Make sure that rice
is perfect.

37:27.537 --> 37:31.498
I want tricia to win.
You don't want to put it
back in the oven?

37:31.500 --> 37:33.708
- Okay.
- We're cooking that chicken
thoroughly, right?

37:33.752 --> 37:37.754
- The dark meat takes time
to cook and break down, okay?
- Thoroughly cooked, chef.

37:37.839 --> 37:39.631
- Let's go, tricia.
- Thank you.

37:39.675 --> 37:41.341
- Bring that vision
to life, chef.
- Yes, chef.

37:41.343 --> 37:44.427
Nyesha: Five minutes left, guys!
Five minutes!

37:48.016 --> 37:49.933
Kenny, you need to season
your food, okay?

37:49.935 --> 37:51.935
- Heard, heard, heard.
- Season your food.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.687
<i> It's either win or go home.</i>
<i> I've been here before.</i>

37:53.730 --> 37:54.762
<i> Here I am still standing.</i>

37:55.065 --> 37:58.316
Somebody has to go home,
and it's not gonna be kenny.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.776
Two minutes!

37:59.820 --> 38:01.194
Start plating,
best dish of your life.

38:01.238 --> 38:03.446
Pyet: You got this, tricia.
Let's go, kenny.

38:03.490 --> 38:05.949
Let's go, chef.
You tasted it, right?

38:05.993 --> 38:07.742
- Oui.
- Oui.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.245
Every single element
on that plate matters.

38:10.247 --> 38:16.251
All: Five, four, three,
two, one.

38:16.295 --> 38:18.712
- Stop cooking! Good job.
- Good job, you guys.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.047
Nyesha: You showed up.
Let's go!

38:22.301 --> 38:23.300
Okay.

38:26.054 --> 38:28.054
We're down to the top seven now,

38:28.098 --> 38:29.597
<i> and so it's hard</i>
<i> not to take it personally</i>

38:29.641 --> 38:33.351
<i> that every chef I've mentored</i>
<i> is up for elimination today.</i>

38:33.395 --> 38:35.228
<i> I hate the fact</i>
<i> that I'm going to have to send</i>
<i> one of them home today.</i>

38:35.230 --> 38:37.355
- Chef.
- How was that?

38:37.399 --> 38:40.066
Intense. We have
three dishes here, chefs.

38:40.110 --> 38:43.111
First, we have a gochujang
glazed new york strip

38:43.155 --> 38:47.324
on top of okra
with a leek and potato purée,

38:47.367 --> 38:50.785
and finish is a pear
korean spice gastrique.

38:50.829 --> 38:54.247
There's a nice cook on the--
did you say new york strip?

38:54.291 --> 38:56.875
- Yes, chef.
- Yes, rested well.

38:58.211 --> 39:01.546
Leek and potato purée,
I kinda want it to be grits.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.507
Gordon: I love the heat
from the glaze.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.051
The dish is very sweet.

39:06.053 --> 39:08.011
Kenny:<i> I'm baffled again.</i>

39:08.013 --> 39:09.346
The only sweet component
I had was the pears,

39:09.389 --> 39:11.222
but even that
still had the kick

39:11.266 --> 39:12.932
because it had
the gochujang in it.

39:12.976 --> 39:16.102
<i> So I felt like</i>
<i> my dish was actually</i>
<i> a bit on the spicy side.</i>

39:16.146 --> 39:18.396
I actually really love
the chili and the pear.

39:18.398 --> 39:21.149
You got the spice
from the gochujang...

39:21.151 --> 39:22.567
- Traditional korean.
- ...And the fermented chili.

39:22.611 --> 39:25.403
A little bit
of that korean pear flavor.

39:25.447 --> 39:27.197
I don't know. At this stage,
I want a touch more.

39:28.742 --> 39:33.119
Our next dish here, we have
a sort of play on a dirty rice.

39:33.163 --> 39:36.122
This is a gochujang glazed
crispy squid

39:36.124 --> 39:37.415
on the bottom,
you have andouille sausage

39:37.417 --> 39:40.043
studded throughout
that kimchi fried rice.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.339
I'm not getting much sausage.
Was that in there, you said?

39:44.341 --> 39:47.300
- Hmm.
- First of all, I love
this chef's direction

39:47.344 --> 39:51.096
with taking
new orleans and korea.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.180
Visually, it's great.

39:52.224 --> 39:54.224
I would've liked
a little more spice.

39:54.226 --> 39:56.559
Um, it tastes delicious.

39:56.561 --> 39:58.520
It's dirty.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.313
And what do I change?
A bit more heat.

40:00.399 --> 40:02.148
More egg.

40:02.150 --> 40:03.400
And then finally...

40:03.693 --> 40:07.237
Yes, and our last dish, we have
a sort of bar inspired dish.

40:07.239 --> 40:08.947
This is
a smoked rolled korean egg.

40:09.032 --> 40:11.157
What you have
in that cast iron cocotte

40:11.159 --> 40:15.787
is a dipping sauce which is made
of cream cheese, some cheddar,

40:15.831 --> 40:16.830
it's got chicken.

40:16.832 --> 40:18.415
Visually, yeah,
it's intriguing.

40:18.417 --> 40:20.166
It's almost like
two dishes into one.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.043
It's bold,
but it looks attractive.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.586
I'm looking
at these three dishes.

40:23.630 --> 40:26.047
<i> I do not know</i>
<i> which dish is going home.</i>

40:26.049 --> 40:27.590
<i> I'm actually kinda surprised.</i>

40:27.634 --> 40:29.926
<i> All of these dishes</i>
<i> have some merit to them,</i>

40:29.970 --> 40:31.344
so it's anyone's game.

40:31.388 --> 40:33.388
- It's meant to be dipped into.
- So you dip?

40:33.390 --> 40:37.934
Yes. There was leg meat used
in this dipping sauce as well.

40:37.978 --> 40:41.563
Egg is delicious.

40:43.150 --> 40:45.066
The one issue I have here...

40:47.195 --> 40:49.446
...Is the raw chicken thigh.

40:50.449 --> 40:53.116
( bleep )

40:53.118 --> 40:55.452
did you eat the--

40:55.454 --> 40:56.453
( spits )

40:56.455 --> 40:59.747
( spits, coughs )

40:59.791 --> 41:02.667
I ( bleep ) am really mad
at myself right now.

41:02.711 --> 41:06.087
That is so raw, there's no way
we can continue eating that.

41:06.089 --> 41:08.214
That dish belongs
to who, please?

41:08.258 --> 41:11.050
That dish belongs to tricia.

41:12.012 --> 41:13.178
Yes, chef.

41:13.221 --> 41:16.848
- Oh, young lady.
- Yes, chef.

41:16.892 --> 41:21.561
There's no way
in good conscience that
we could put you forward.

41:22.898 --> 41:24.814
I understand, chef.
Thank you.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.107
Young lady, I'm lost for words.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.817
I've grown to like you a lot

41:27.819 --> 41:29.736
and you've done
some amazing things.

41:29.779 --> 41:31.488
And you plate like angel.

41:31.531 --> 41:32.697
Thank you, chef.

41:32.741 --> 41:36.409
Please say goodbye
to your colleagues

41:36.453 --> 41:39.204
and enter the elevator,
thank you.

41:39.206 --> 41:41.206
- We'll see you again.
- ( indistinct chatter )

41:41.208 --> 41:44.209
it sucks to be eliminated
by a raw dish,

41:44.252 --> 41:48.087
<i> but to be in this competition</i>
<i> was such an honor</i>

41:48.131 --> 41:51.216
and to have worked
alongside chef ramsay,

41:51.259 --> 41:54.219
having him teach me,
has been incredible.

41:54.221 --> 41:55.386
Bye, chefs.
Thank you for everything.

41:55.388 --> 41:57.430
- Take care. Head up.
- Bye, tricia.

41:57.432 --> 41:59.599
- Thank you, tricia.
- Thank you. Bye.

42:04.481 --> 42:05.772
Oh, I failed.

42:05.815 --> 42:07.232
( bleep )

42:07.275 --> 42:11.110
all of you,
time is running out.

42:12.822 --> 42:15.365
Everything you do matters.

42:16.785 --> 42:18.159
I thank god
for humbling me today.

42:18.203 --> 42:21.120
I got a taste of what
elimination feels like.

42:21.122 --> 42:22.872
<i> That's not happening</i>
<i> ever again.</i>

42:22.916 --> 42:24.916
Good night.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.793
Good night. Thank you.

42:26.836 --> 42:28.253
- Thank you, chefs.
- Thank you.

42:28.296 --> 42:30.505
( gordon sighs )
raw chicken.

42:30.590 --> 42:32.590
Damn, trish.

42:36.596 --> 42:38.805
Gordon:<i> Next time</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

42:38.807 --> 42:40.890
Welcome to the semi-finals.

42:40.934 --> 42:43.351
Don't celebrate too hard
just yet though.

42:43.395 --> 42:46.646
For three of you,
your journey ends tonight.

42:46.690 --> 42:48.231
Nyesha: Fight for that spot
in your finale.

42:48.567 --> 42:52.151
This is it. I've gotta take
everything I've learned
from this competition,

42:52.195 --> 42:53.945
and I've gotta get it
on that plate.

42:53.989 --> 42:55.029
Kenny:
This is personal for me.

42:55.407 --> 42:58.825
I'm rethinking all of
my life choices at this moment.

42:58.868 --> 43:00.034
What did you want?
What did you want?

43:00.078 --> 43:00.868
Kenny:
It's a no-holds-barred
right now.

43:01.079 --> 43:03.162
- Aah!
- Let's do this, big boy.

43:03.206 --> 43:06.749
Courtney: It is the finale
that is on the line.
