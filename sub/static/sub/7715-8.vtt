WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.030
They caught
the Scranton Strangler.

00:07.107 --> 00:08.096
They trapped him
in his house.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.570
FEMALE NEWSCASTER ON COMPUTER:
<i>...and then</i>
<i>photographing them,</i>

00:10.644 --> 00:11.907
<i>is believed to be inside.</i>

00:12.412 --> 00:15.746
<i>Police have now surrounded</i>
<i>the apartment complex.</i>

00:15.883 --> 00:17.078
Police have surrounded.
<i>And we</i>

00:17.217 --> 00:19.812
<i>now see what appears to</i>
<i>be a SWAT van pulling up.</i>

00:19.887 --> 00:21.378
SWAT, SWAT's arriving.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.185
<i>It is unknown if he</i>
<i>is armed with any...</i>

00:23.290 --> 00:25.020
They should
do that thing
where they play

00:25.092 --> 00:27.459
the really good music
to get him to come out.

00:27.761 --> 00:31.425
Ugh! They shouldn't
televise any of this.
It just encourages copycats.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.700
Just say copies.
Why do you have to
drag cats into this?

00:34.801 --> 00:37.396
Okay, while this is
interesting, we should
get back to work.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.197
These standoffs
can last a long time.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.065
What if it's
another Waco?

00:41.141 --> 00:42.404
It's pronounced "wacko."

00:42.476 --> 00:44.172
Some events
are so newsworthy,

00:44.244 --> 00:46.941
so historic,
that you have to stop
everything to watch.

00:47.114 --> 00:49.879
Balloon boy,
Michael Jackson's funeral...

00:49.983 --> 00:52.782
Uh, things that,
if you didn't
see them live,

00:52.853 --> 00:55.618
you wouldn't really
care that you didn't
see them at all.

00:55.822 --> 00:57.688
FEMALE NEWSCASTER:
<i>Coming to you</i>
<i>from the corner of...</i>

00:57.791 --> 00:59.589
Columbia Street
and Washington Ave.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.228
God, when is he
gonna come out?

01:01.295 --> 01:03.764
<i>For what we all</i>
<i>pray is the last...</i>

01:04.298 --> 01:06.392
ANDY: I bet he's wishing
he had a hybrid, right?

01:06.466 --> 01:07.991
Sixty miles
to the gallon
in the city!

01:08.368 --> 01:11.133
No, I bet he's wishing
he was strangling someone.

01:11.204 --> 01:12.365
Okay, that's our street.

01:12.839 --> 01:14.273
That's our street.
He's going down
our street.

01:14.341 --> 01:15.400
Come on, everybody.

01:15.676 --> 01:16.871
KEVIN: Go. Go, go, go.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.570
There it is.
There it is.

01:20.714 --> 01:21.807
I saw it.
ANDY: Where? Where?

01:21.882 --> 01:23.373
I saw it. It's gone.

01:23.450 --> 01:24.440
ANDY: Oh!

01:24.518 --> 01:26.578
He went right by.

01:26.653 --> 01:28.849
You missed it.
You missed it.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.189
MICHAEL: <i>"Grandpa,</i>
<i>where were you the day</i>

01:33.260 --> 01:35.161
<i>"the Scranton Strangler</i>
<i>was caught?"</i>

01:35.295 --> 01:39.665
Well, I was there, kiddo.
I was there.

01:40.734 --> 01:44.193
And I'll tell you what,

01:44.371 --> 01:50.003
you go sell these
and buy yourself
a nice spaceship.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:11.331 --> 02:13.027
Michael.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.135
Walk with me.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.565
Gabe and I are
having a party,

02:16.637 --> 02:18.538
and everyone's invited,
and it's at his apartment.

02:18.605 --> 02:20.198
And we're gonna watch <i>Glee.</i>
<i>Glee?</i> What is <i>Glee?</i>

02:20.273 --> 02:21.707
Some sort of
television program?

02:21.775 --> 02:23.801
Jim, I need
that thing, stat.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.368
Okay.
ERIN: Yeah,
it's a TV show.

02:25.445 --> 02:27.846
Dwight. Signing.

02:27.914 --> 02:30.110
I don't have time for
parties. I don't have
time for TV shows.

02:30.183 --> 02:31.947
Stanley,
what time is that thing
that I have to do?

02:32.019 --> 02:34.079
I...
Cancel it.
Are you still here?

02:34.554 --> 02:36.580
Oh, it's just...
It's our first
party together.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.818
So...
Mmm-mmm!

02:39.893 --> 02:40.883
Did you hear
what I said?

02:41.128 --> 02:42.926
I'm a very busy man.
I don't have time
for your TV show.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.398
Okay, sorry.
I'm joking.

02:46.833 --> 02:47.892
Wait, which...
I'm joking.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.065
I'm kidding around.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.038
I'm not actually angry.

02:54.474 --> 02:56.238
I'm not busy at all.
I'm not doing anything.

02:56.309 --> 02:58.301
And I know what <i>Glee</i> is.
I am a total Gleek.

02:58.578 --> 03:00.479
Oh, me too.
You know who my
favorite character is?

03:01.148 --> 03:02.138
The invalid.

03:02.783 --> 03:03.910
Yes, I'd love to
come to your party.

03:04.451 --> 03:05.441
Oh, my gosh.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.886
I don't know
if Michael likes
Gabe that much,

03:07.954 --> 03:09.855
but there's
this thing on <i>Glee</i>
called mash-up,

03:09.923 --> 03:13.519
where two things
that don't go together
make one great song.

03:13.593 --> 03:17.325
Take Gabe, take Michael,
you make "Gaymike."

03:18.098 --> 03:19.122
Best friends.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.425
No, really?

03:20.667 --> 03:22.693
Is there time
to change this?
That show...

03:23.136 --> 03:24.900
I mean,
first they say
that Mr. Schue

03:24.971 --> 03:26.564
doesn't know
anything about
choreography,

03:26.973 --> 03:28.236
and then, like,
three episodes later,

03:28.308 --> 03:30.209
he's this fantastic
choreographer.

03:30.277 --> 03:31.267
Pick a lane, people.

03:31.578 --> 03:33.103
And what was with
Jesse's sudden turn

03:33.180 --> 03:34.876
on Rachel between
<i>Dream On</i> and <i>Funk?</i>

03:34.948 --> 03:36.576
Where the heck
did that come from?

03:36.650 --> 03:39.586
Honestly,
that show, it's just...
It's irresponsible.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.413
Are you going?

03:41.755 --> 03:43.621
Not because I want to.

03:44.124 --> 03:48.425
Of all feelings,
to base a show
around glee?

03:48.595 --> 03:50.791
Thirst. Now that's
a show I'd watch.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.630
I would watch that.

03:53.700 --> 03:54.793
Tonight might be
a convenient night

03:54.868 --> 03:55.892
for us to have
some intercourse.

03:59.706 --> 04:01.504
You're having a party
at Gabe's apartment?
Mmm-hmm.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.339
I'd love it if
you were there.
You would?

04:03.610 --> 04:05.272
You and Michael
are always the
life of the party.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.114
Try and keep me
from coming.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.913
Why would I keep
you from coming?

04:12.252 --> 04:15.188
Try and hide it,
I will track
this party down.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.848
Why would I hide it?

04:19.526 --> 04:20.516
Kevin.

04:20.627 --> 04:22.152
Hey. You going tonight?

04:22.229 --> 04:23.288
Yes, I am. Are you?

04:23.563 --> 04:25.429
Yeah. You got to go
to the boss's party, right?

04:25.499 --> 04:26.489
Mmm-hmm.

04:26.566 --> 04:29.661
What? No, Gabe...
Gabe is not the boss.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.470
No, he's not the boss.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.506
Why did you just
say he was the boss?

04:34.808 --> 04:37.403
'Cause you're the boss.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.647
Guys, do you consider
Gabe to be the boss?

04:45.085 --> 04:46.383
It's a make-your-own-pizza
night.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.443
MICHAEL: Okay.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.581
Isn't Gabe's
place so nice?
Uh-huh.

04:49.656 --> 04:51.522
Look at the size
of those wine glasses,
Michael.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.583
They're big.

04:54.261 --> 04:56.662
Those posters used
to be real French ads.

04:56.730 --> 04:57.789
All right.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.662
So, these are your
cheeses, your hams,

05:00.734 --> 05:02.999
your sausages,
your herbs and
your vegetables.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.966
Here's what's been done.
Start creating.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.764
Sometimes it helps
to think of a part
of the world

05:07.841 --> 05:10.037
and then make...
Okay. Okay. Okay.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.341
Gabe likes to
entertain a lot,

05:12.913 --> 05:16.372
and he cooks in an oven,
and all that jazz.

05:16.449 --> 05:19.009
I just have
a different lifestyle.

05:19.085 --> 05:20.485
They have these
bags of vegetables

05:20.554 --> 05:22.819
that steam right
inside their own bag.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.649
So, I'll get a glass
of sangria,

05:24.724 --> 05:26.317
sit down in front
of the TV,

05:26.393 --> 05:28.225
my bag of vegetables...

05:28.662 --> 05:30.927
Before you know it,
I'm ready for bed.

05:31.398 --> 05:32.388
Okay.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.632
You don't really
toss the dough.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.360
Try to destroy
the old ways, Gabe.

05:36.436 --> 05:38.166
I will not let you.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.243
So, welcome
to my man cave.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.671
I did my senior
year abroad in Japan.
Best year of my life.

05:47.781 --> 05:48.805
You play?

05:48.915 --> 05:51.441
I like to create
soundscapes.

05:51.518 --> 05:55.922
Imagine one instant of
a song expanded to be
the size of the universe.

05:56.456 --> 05:57.480
I can't even do that.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.655
She's up. Great.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.691
Cece is reverse cycling,

06:03.763 --> 06:06.631
which means she
sleeps all day,
and she's up all night,

06:06.700 --> 06:09.864
which basically means
I'm up all day,
and I'm up all night.

06:09.936 --> 06:14.636
And if it doesn't stop soon,
I am gonna be up all night.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.975
The show's starting.
The show's starting.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.979
The show's starting.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.542
Show's starting.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.118
FINN: <i>All right,</i>
<i>let's gather around.</i>

06:30.056 --> 06:31.046
Who's that?

06:31.124 --> 06:32.114
KELLY: Finn.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.153
Who's that?
Rachel.

06:34.527 --> 06:37.429
Okay. Which one's Glee?

06:37.497 --> 06:39.227
You have to stop.

06:39.299 --> 06:40.858
Where's Michael?
Where's Michael?

06:40.934 --> 06:42.266
We can't start
without Michael.

06:42.335 --> 06:47.103
Oh, here he is.
Oh, yay, and let
the show begin.

06:48.909 --> 06:49.933
GABE: That's a little loud.

06:50.176 --> 06:54.409
Well, actually, I think
it's not loud enough. May I?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.444
Excuse me.
Thank you, sir.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.881
There you go.
It's <i>Glee,</i> right?

06:58.952 --> 07:00.284
Rock and roll.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.821
Turn it up to 11.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.083
Come on, Michael.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.125
Spinal cord.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.724
Some of us are trying
to have a conversation.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.793
Well, some of us
are trying to...

07:08.862 --> 07:10.353
I'll just turn
the captions on.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.962
Well, I will turn
the volume up.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.860
That's for the other box.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.870
Okay.

07:24.811 --> 07:25.904
Okay.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.779
Here's what
we're gonna do.

07:29.849 --> 07:31.340
Right down the hall
is a bedroom.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.853
All the real <i>Glee</i> fans
are gonna go down the hall

07:33.920 --> 07:35.616
to the real <i>Glee</i>
party in the bedroom.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.282
Follow me

07:37.357 --> 07:39.223
where we can crank it.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.191
What's your angle?
That woman.

07:44.264 --> 07:45.926
She's been in
a couple of episodes
of <i>Friday Night Lights.</i>

07:45.999 --> 07:47.023
You know what?
I'm so confused.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.298
Is this a <i>Glee</i> watching
party or is this
a <i>Glee</i> pausing party?

07:50.370 --> 07:52.305
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
Because we keep stopping it

07:52.372 --> 07:53.635
to get a history
lesson about
television...

07:53.707 --> 07:54.697
OSCAR: I didn't
know the rules.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.402
There. It's on, it's on.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.477
I didn't read
the rule book.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.704
Hey, Michael.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.708
Maybe you should try going
in the other room again.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.979
You can have my seat.
It's closer to the TV.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.044
It'll seem louder.

08:09.589 --> 08:12.149
Pam, I have a loaded gun
in my desk at work.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.622
And if I ever start
acting like that
weenie, Gabe,

08:15.729 --> 08:16.856
I want you to
take that gun,

08:16.930 --> 08:18.728
and I want you
to shoot me,
like, 100 times

08:18.798 --> 08:20.699
in the groin
till I'm dead, okay?

08:20.900 --> 08:22.334
You have a gun
in your desk?

08:22.902 --> 08:23.995
Somewhere.

08:24.104 --> 08:27.836
Hey. Marantz tube
stereo from the 1970s!

08:28.074 --> 08:30.634
I respect that.
I respect that a lot.

08:32.511 --> 08:35.140
The five Chinese
virility herbs.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.410
No kidding.
This is powdered
seahorse.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.015
They say that 15
Chinese soldiers

08:40.086 --> 08:42.783
fought off the entire
army of Genghis Khan
just using this stuff.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.348
You know what they say...
No, what?

08:46.559 --> 08:49.028
What is this,
samurai woodcuts? Yup.

08:49.929 --> 08:50.919
Pretty erotic.

08:51.498 --> 08:52.488
Hmm. Yeah.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.968
Better men than Gabe
have tried to be my boss.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.298
David got fired.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.567
Charles got fired.
Jan went crazy.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.674
Ed Truck,
who I liked,
got decapitated.

09:03.743 --> 09:04.733
Michael.
Yes.

09:04.811 --> 09:07.280
I find it
absolutely disgraceful

09:07.347 --> 09:09.213
that no one
followed you in here
for your walk-out.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.477
I took the liberty of
making a list of everyone
who didn't follow you in here.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.611
Jim, Oscar, Creed,

09:14.854 --> 09:17.881
me, at first... Kelly...
Maybe I should go.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.052
Are you gonna
quiet that baby
or do I have to?

09:31.738 --> 09:35.937
In the Schrute family,
the youngest child
always raises the others.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.068
I've been raising
children since
I was a baby.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.010
Take a shot.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.048
Oh, thanks.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.489
So much Asian stuff!

09:50.990 --> 09:52.754
I wonder if there's
a guy in China right now

09:52.826 --> 09:55.125
looking at
a bunch of our stuff.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.162
Why does Erin
like Gabe?

09:59.466 --> 10:01.401
Andy, look,

10:01.468 --> 10:04.529
all I know is,
if I was a girl
and I had to choose

10:04.604 --> 10:07.438
between a tall
dude who loved Asia

10:07.774 --> 10:12.178
and a you-looking dude
who loved sweaters
and wearing sweaters,

10:13.980 --> 10:15.141
I'd choose you.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.114
That's really nice.
Thank you.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.052
And I'd blow your mind.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.094
OSCAR: Jim, what
are you doing?

10:34.167 --> 10:36.329
It's a commercial break,
so I just wanted
to check the scores.

10:36.402 --> 10:37.392
Flip it back, please.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.665
Okay.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.366
The show's back on.
What happened?

10:43.776 --> 10:44.937
We were behind.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.305
Go to the recorded version.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.004
Oh, my God.
What song was that?

10:48.081 --> 10:49.640
I wasn't recording it.
What?

10:50.183 --> 10:51.617
What song was it?

10:51.684 --> 10:52.811
Wait, why do you
have to record it?

10:53.219 --> 10:55.188
Right now is why, Erin.
We're living it.

10:55.588 --> 10:56.647
Start recording now.
Jim.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.389
Okay, they did
<i>Blinded by the Light,</i>

10:59.459 --> 11:02.258
and they did it with
an actual blind guy.

11:03.563 --> 11:06.055
Was it worth it, Jim?
'Cause we missed it.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.865
If I could get her
sleeping normally,
I would get my life back.

11:11.638 --> 11:12.628
That would be nice,
wouldn't it?

11:12.906 --> 11:14.067
I can't even
talk about it.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.674
You know, it's not
really necessary for me

11:15.742 --> 11:17.233
to sit here
holding her all night.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.710
Just go to
Gabe's refrigerator,
get a lump of suet,

11:20.780 --> 11:23.773
or any kind of
congealed animal
fat will do, really.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.479
Tie a piece of string to it,
tie the other end to her toe,

11:26.553 --> 11:28.317
pop the suet
in her mouth,

11:28.922 --> 11:30.185
she'll be happy for hours.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.023
I kind of doubt
Gabe has suet.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.519
Really?

11:35.595 --> 11:38.292
Well, then here we are.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.388
Michael.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.631
Gabe is making
the pigs in a blanket,

11:42.702 --> 11:44.603
and he kind of
needs some help,

11:44.671 --> 11:46.765
so he was wondering
if you could help him.

11:56.316 --> 11:59.480
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Phyllis Vance.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.186
Is that White Diamonds
by Elizabeth Taylor?

12:06.326 --> 12:07.487
You know your perfumes.

12:07.994 --> 12:09.656
My nanny used
to wear that.

12:09.862 --> 12:11.194
I just ate an
entire seahorse.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.858
<i>I have to admit,</i>
<i>I did not think</i>
<i>it was gonna work,</i>

12:13.933 --> 12:15.196
<i>but it's totally working.</i>

12:15.802 --> 12:18.135
<i>I feel exactly</i>
<i>like a seahorse.</i>

12:25.211 --> 12:26.235
Look who I found.

12:26.312 --> 12:28.508
Yeah, well, I wasn't
very hard to find.

12:28.748 --> 12:29.977
Let's go ahead
and wash your hands.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.046
Is this the same dough
that you used for
the pizza crust?

12:36.789 --> 12:38.155
Yeah. Waste not, right?

12:38.324 --> 12:40.350
So, these are pizza dogs.
These aren't
pigs in a blanket,

12:40.693 --> 12:41.683
per se.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.596
Michael knows
everything there is
to know about snacks.

12:44.664 --> 12:45.654
Well.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.291
Gabe was born in 1982.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.092
He was the longest
baby in the hospital.

12:49.168 --> 12:50.568
He's the longest
baby in this room.

12:50.803 --> 12:53.864
What's the longest thing
you've ever seen?

12:53.940 --> 12:54.964
For me,
it was the tail
from a jet...

12:55.074 --> 12:56.064
Erin, you don't have to...

12:56.175 --> 12:57.837
Yeah, you know what,
Erin, you do have to.
Michael,

12:58.911 --> 13:00.641
you are making this
harder than it has to be.

13:00.847 --> 13:02.008
That's what she said.

13:10.757 --> 13:11.747
 Hey.

13:11.924 --> 13:13.119
PAM: It's a miracle.

13:13.192 --> 13:15.627
She loves him.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.330
I don't know
about "love."

13:19.098 --> 13:20.157
She loves me.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.665
Outside. My car.
Two minutes.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.673
All right. Something's
come up. I gotta go.

13:28.741 --> 13:29.731
No, no, no,
she'll wake up.

13:29.842 --> 13:30.866
No, I have
something to do.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.946
I know what you have to do.
Please stay with Cece.

13:34.714 --> 13:38.446
Dwight,
I've always considered us
to be very good friends.

13:38.518 --> 13:39.816
Great friends.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.013
Remember your concussion?

13:41.688 --> 13:43.020
I do,

13:43.089 --> 13:44.250
but you married
my worst enemy.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.293
I know.
Well, I think
enemy's a strong word,

13:46.426 --> 13:48.224
'cause I think we have
a really charming
back-and-forth...

13:48.294 --> 13:49.626
Enough.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.796
I will require
beer and pizza
to think this over.

13:57.036 --> 13:58.595
Absolutely.
From Jim.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.661
Well, I don't
think that's...

13:59.739 --> 14:02.106
Do it.

14:02.642 --> 14:03.837
What kind of pizza
would you like?

14:04.977 --> 14:06.878
Surprise me. No.

14:08.214 --> 14:09.238
Pepperoni.

14:13.619 --> 14:15.645
Okay.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.452
All right.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.254
And the winner is,
by two votes, Sam and...

14:20.393 --> 14:22.362
What's going on?

14:28.468 --> 14:31.233
Hey, Creed.
Do you read Chinese?

14:31.471 --> 14:32.461
Better than English.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.530
What does this say?

14:45.084 --> 14:48.543
Hello, UPS, still waiting
on that five minutes
with Erin I ordered.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.021
Oh, never mind,
it's here.

14:50.757 --> 14:53.226
Well, if it isn't
the belle of the ball.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.653
You throw
a lovely party, milady.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.258
Are you having
a good time?

14:59.332 --> 15:01.164
Did you wear
my favorite outfit
on purpose?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.224
Andy, you look awful.

15:03.269 --> 15:05.932
You're four seasons
in a day.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.702
You got the autumn
thing going on.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.643
But if you put on baby...

15:15.782 --> 15:17.273
But if you put
on a blue...

15:22.822 --> 15:24.620
It's springtime
in the Rockies.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.819
Are you all right?
No!

15:27.393 --> 15:29.828
 Mmm-mmm.
Insert it in my mouth.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.023
Okay, that's not
gonna make your

15:31.097 --> 15:32.793
pizza-eating experience
any better, trust me.

15:32.865 --> 15:33.855
Oh, try me.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.926
Jim, just don't
think of it as
degrading.

15:37.003 --> 15:39.632
Think of it as you happen
to be moving the pizza

15:39.972 --> 15:42.669
six inches this way,
and he happens
to be biting it.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.711
I'd prefer for him to
think of it as degrading.

15:44.777 --> 15:45.767
Okay.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.745
Crust first.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.679
Okay. Now the beer.

15:58.357 --> 15:59.347
Beer me, Jim.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.663
Gentle.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.325
Mmm, mmm.

16:10.069 --> 16:11.731
Now I've got to
go meet Angela.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.670
What? No, wait.
You said you
were gonna help us.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.866
I have a legal
obligation to Angela,
okay?

16:16.943 --> 16:18.172
She needs to be serviced.

16:18.244 --> 16:19.405
You need to stop talking.
Oh, God.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.811
Oh, come on.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.348
Can we stop
the fake prissy act?

16:22.415 --> 16:23.405
Join the real world.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.042
Sex contracts exist, okay?

16:25.117 --> 16:26.813
Okay, fine, there
must be some way

16:26.886 --> 16:28.411
to get out of it,
even just for tonight.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.013
Yeah, sure.
Jim can go see her.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.047
Okay.
You've been with
a blonde before?

16:32.124 --> 16:33.148
It's the big leagues.

16:33.292 --> 16:34.487
I'm going home,
and I'm taking my baby.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.392
No, no, don't.

16:36.462 --> 16:37.555
I will go
talk to Angela.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.228
She is in heat.

16:39.298 --> 16:40.357
She will eat
your face off.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.467
The reverse cycling
ends tonight.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.068
A single piece of
pepperoni, please.

16:48.374 --> 16:49.808
I'm not...

16:57.717 --> 16:58.810
What are you doing?

16:58.885 --> 17:03.255
I wanted to eat
a pig in a blanket
in a blanket.

17:12.832 --> 17:13.925
PHYLLIS: Are you all right?

17:14.934 --> 17:16.402
Erin likes Gabe.

17:16.502 --> 17:17.765
I know.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.669
I thought you two
were nice together.

17:20.239 --> 17:21.605
Do you think
that they've ever...

17:21.674 --> 17:22.664
Made love?

17:24.242 --> 17:26.040
I don't know.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.710
Well, girls tell each
other things, right?

17:29.649 --> 17:31.117
I'll see what
I can find out.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.211
Where you been?

17:36.889 --> 17:37.913
I just went out
for a walk.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.522
Cable's out.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.288
What? Really?

17:41.427 --> 17:42.554
That stinks.

17:42.662 --> 17:43.789
It's still on upstairs.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.966
What does that mean?
Party's over?
Everybody leaves?

17:47.166 --> 17:48.156
CREED: Are you sure?

17:48.334 --> 17:52.669
Hey,
Puck and Finn worked it out,
and the solo is now a duet.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.172
Are you kidding me?
No.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.299
Now, that's going on.
Yep.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.170
KEVIN: I can't believe
we're missing that.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.713
Boy, I wish
I could see that.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.081
You know what?
I have an idea.

18:03.382 --> 18:04.543
I don't know if
it's gonna work,

18:04.617 --> 18:06.950
but let me give
it this... Okay.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.009
I'm gonna
give it a shot.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.386
Please, Michael,
just make the <i>Glee</i> happen.

18:10.456 --> 18:11.480
Good luck, Michael.

18:11.557 --> 18:12.855
Erin.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.793
So, how long have you
two been going out now?

18:15.895 --> 18:17.420
Oh, like three months.

18:17.563 --> 18:19.464
I imagine things are
starting to heat up.

18:19.865 --> 18:20.855
I don't know.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.458
Of course, you don't
want to rush things.

18:22.535 --> 18:25.528
I mean, the anticipation
can be so exquisite.

18:26.372 --> 18:27.806
Bob and I
took our time.

18:27.873 --> 18:30.433
The first time we
saw each other naked,
we didn't even make love.

18:30.509 --> 18:34.173
We just stared at each other
until we fell asleep.

18:34.246 --> 18:35.373
It was magical.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.079
I have to go, Phyllis.
Really magical.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.219
Hey in there.
It's me, Pam.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.586
It's not Dwight.
Don't think it's Dwight.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.549
What are you doing here?

18:45.625 --> 18:48.151
I know you and Dwight
have this weird deal.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.157
He sent me out here
to see if you
could postpone.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.262
Are you authorized
to do this?

18:53.332 --> 18:55.460
Yes. I have been
so authorized.

18:55.901 --> 18:59.668
Okay, well, tell him
that we'll do this
tomorrow night instead.

19:00.239 --> 19:01.730
Okay.
Wait, Pam. Pam.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.703
How did he seem?
You know, like, did
he seem disappointed?

19:06.345 --> 19:08.814
You know, there are
a lot of guys out there

19:08.881 --> 19:10.247
who would just love

19:10.383 --> 19:13.478
and appreciate a woman...
You know what,
Pam, just save it.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.348
You did this?

19:19.492 --> 19:21.893
No, I was just check...
Yes, I did. Yes. Yes.

19:21.961 --> 19:22.951
Why won't you like him?

19:23.029 --> 19:24.998
What is there to like?
He's just...

19:25.865 --> 19:30.496
He's a weird, little,
skeevy guy with no waist.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.231
Why do you care
whether we like
him or not?

19:32.304 --> 19:34.034
I care if you like him.

19:34.407 --> 19:35.966
Why? I'm not
your father.

19:50.556 --> 19:52.115
All right.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.386
Okay.
Go to your room.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.050
What?

19:55.127 --> 19:56.857
Go to your room,
young lady.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.802
I'm not going
to my room.

20:04.470 --> 20:06.996
You listen to me.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.166
You listen good.

20:08.274 --> 20:12.268
You are not to see
that boy anymore.

20:12.478 --> 20:13.571
You listen to me.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.638
You are not to
tell me what to do.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.650
As long as you are
living under this roof,

20:17.717 --> 20:18.912
you are going
to do what I say.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.247
 I hate your roof.

20:20.319 --> 20:21.378
Do not raise
your voice to me.

20:21.487 --> 20:23.319
I'll raise it all I want.
I'll raise the roof.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.187
I will pull
this car over.

20:25.257 --> 20:27.283
I hate it.
I hate your car.

20:28.327 --> 20:29.590
See you, Oscar.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.561
If you break that girl's
heart, I will kill you.

20:36.936 --> 20:37.926
It's just a figure
of speech.

20:38.604 --> 20:40.903

break that girl's heart,

I will literally kill you
and your entire family.

How much?

21:03.129 --> 21:05.155

Like, four or five,
I don't know.

21:08.901 --> 21:10.870
I've got just the thing.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.246
