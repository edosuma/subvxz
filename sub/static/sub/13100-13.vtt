[crackling]

00:04.875 --> 00:07.667
[instrumental music]

00:09.042 --> 00:10.750
(Ivanova)
Well, that's the first.

00:10.833 --> 00:12.917
It's gonna take a long time
to get the level of trade back

00:13.000 --> 00:15.167
to where it was before
we broke away from Earth.

00:15.250 --> 00:16.667
Right now we need
the docking fees more than ever

00:16.750 --> 00:18.875
but we just can't seem
to catch a break.

00:18.958 --> 00:20.417
[sighs]
One thing's sure.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.833
We can't keep relying
on the Minbari for protection.

00:22.917 --> 00:24.792
We have to create
a broader base of support.

00:24.875 --> 00:27.208
Yeah, and you have an idea.

00:27.292 --> 00:29.583
Always, commander. Always.

00:30.750 --> 00:32.542
What do you mean, 100 credits?

00:32.625 --> 00:35.792
I mean more than 99,
less than 101.

00:35.875 --> 00:39.083
What, you got a hearing problem
or a math problem?

00:39.167 --> 00:41.542
Look, I, I can't get into
conceptual arguments with you.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.208
I, I, I got people waiting.

00:43.292 --> 00:44.458
Look, that's three times
the delivery charge

00:44.542 --> 00:45.875
for a package this size.

00:45.958 --> 00:48.458
That was before we had
a revolution around here.

00:48.542 --> 00:50.292
Now in my little corner
of Earthforce

00:50.375 --> 00:52.292
the mail still gets delivered.

00:52.375 --> 00:54.958
If I got to use trap doors,
alien transports

00:55.042 --> 00:57.625
and back channels to get
the mail in and out of here

00:57.708 --> 01:00.792
then that's what I'll do
because that's my job.

01:00.875 --> 01:05.708
Neither rain nor snow nor
meteors nor alien invasion nor--

01:05.792 --> 01:08.833
- Look, this is extortion.
- It's business.

01:08.917 --> 01:11.375
You see when my costs go up,
I have to pass that along

01:11.458 --> 01:13.167
to the consumer.

01:13.250 --> 01:14.792
That's, that's you

01:14.875 --> 01:16.458
just in case that's another
one of those concepts

01:16.542 --> 01:18.333
you got a problem with.

01:18.417 --> 01:20.125
That's my box.

01:21.583 --> 01:23.250
No, it's the,
it's the property

01:23.333 --> 01:25.042
of Earth Alliance
Postal Service.

01:25.125 --> 01:28.000
You pony up 100 credits,
then it's your box.

01:29.333 --> 01:31.583
Alright, look,
it's the last package

01:31.667 --> 01:33.625
I'm gonna get from Earth
for a long time.

01:33.708 --> 01:37.333
Uh, it's got mozzarella,
anchovies

01:37.417 --> 01:40.208
garlic cloves, pepperoni.

01:41.333 --> 01:45.000
Yeah. What, uh,
what kind of pepperoni?

01:45.083 --> 01:47.542
Is it the, uh, the big sticks
or the small ones?

01:47.625 --> 01:51.833
Oh, we're talking
big sticks like this.

01:51.917 --> 01:53.708
[whistles]

01:56.458 --> 01:57.667
Give me the box.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.250
And break my oath
to the post office?

02:00.333 --> 02:02.917
I'd die first. Next.

02:16.792 --> 02:19.083
(female #1)
All passengers debarking
at Babylon 5

02:19.167 --> 02:20.750
please report to Shuttle Bay 7.

02:20.833 --> 02:23.042
All passengers debarking
at Babylon 5

02:23.125 --> 02:25.083
please report to Shuttle Bay 7.

02:35.292 --> 02:38.375

[dramatic music]

03:48.250 --> 03:51.333
[music continues]

04:08.042 --> 04:12.833
(Ivanova)
The Babylon project was
our last, best hope for peace.

04:15.917 --> 04:17.667
It failed.

04:32.583 --> 04:34.583
But in the year
of the Shadow War

04:34.667 --> 04:36.958
it became something greater.

04:37.042 --> 04:40.542
Our last best hope
for victory.

04:45.042 --> 04:47.125
The year is 2260.

04:47.208 --> 04:50.000
The place Babylon 5.

04:50.083 --> 04:53.167
[theme music]

05:23.125 --> 05:26.167
[music continues]

05:41.708 --> 05:44.250
You're right.
Looks like Banta Flu.

05:44.333 --> 05:46.583
Alright, I want everyone
on this level inoculated.

05:46.667 --> 05:48.458
I think we caught it early
enough to keep it from spreading

05:48.542 --> 05:49.917
into the general population.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.917
But these two are gonna
have to go into Isolab

05:52.000 --> 05:54.500
until I know they're past
the contagious point.

05:54.583 --> 05:56.042
Mind if I come along?

05:56.125 --> 05:57.625
They're nervous
around strangers.

05:57.708 --> 05:59.792
Yeah, no problem.

05:59.875 --> 06:02.375
How'd you catch this
so fast anyway, Marcus?

06:02.458 --> 06:04.250
Normally, the signs
of Banta Flu don't show up

06:04.333 --> 06:06.042
until you're already contagious.

06:06.125 --> 06:09.500
Most of these symptoms wouldn't
have been visible yesterday.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.792
Banta Flu is normally contracted

06:11.875 --> 06:13.917
by eating alien food

06:14.000 --> 06:18.875
that's been mixed in
with human food and fermented.

06:18.958 --> 06:20.333
I saw some of them
eating out of a waste bin

06:20.417 --> 06:22.250
recognized the nastier bits
from the year

06:22.333 --> 06:24.833
I spent on a Drazi colony.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.542
It's bad enough they have to
live that way in the first place

06:26.625 --> 06:28.000
without it making them sick.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.458
Hmm.

06:29.542 --> 06:30.833
Lot of folks around here
seem to think

06:30.917 --> 06:33.000
that lurkers deserve
what they get.

06:33.083 --> 06:35.125
Figure it's better
to let them die and--

06:35.208 --> 06:38.292
And thus deplete
the surplus population.

06:38.375 --> 06:39.583
Dickens.

06:41.458 --> 06:43.500
You know, uh,
I used to think it was awful

06:43.583 --> 06:45.958
that life was so unfair.

06:46.042 --> 06:47.917
Then I thought

06:48.000 --> 06:51.667
wouldn't it be much worse
if life were fair

06:51.750 --> 06:53.750
and all the terrible things
that happen to us

06:53.833 --> 06:55.958
come because we actually
deserve them?

06:58.125 --> 07:01.875
So now I take great comfort
in the general hostility

07:01.958 --> 07:04.458
and unfairness of the universe.

07:07.208 --> 07:10.125
(male #1)
'Confirmed, Shuttle 1.
You're cleared for docking.'

07:17.083 --> 07:19.083
Don't worry. They'll be fine.

07:19.167 --> 07:21.125
You know, I was noticing
that pin you wear.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.000
All the other rangers
wear one just like it

07:23.083 --> 07:25.292
but I don't know what it means.

07:25.375 --> 07:28.667
The two figures on either side

07:28.750 --> 07:30.833
one human, the other Minbari.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.917
'They blend together
in the middle to signify'

07:33.000 --> 07:36.708
the two halves of our souls
uniting against a common enemy.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.875
This jewel?

07:39.958 --> 07:41.958
(Marcus)
'Minbari call that Isil'zha.'

07:42.042 --> 07:46.542
Means the future, birth,
beginnings, dawn of a new age.

07:46.625 --> 07:47.958
Isil'zha.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.750
I like it.

07:50.833 --> 07:53.167
It's a subtle language
for subtle people.

07:54.708 --> 07:57.875
Took me a year of studying
to get the fundamentals down.

07:57.958 --> 08:00.917
The Minbari say the only way
to understand the battle

08:01.000 --> 08:03.042
is to understand the language.

08:03.125 --> 08:06.208
War is as much concept
as execution.

08:06.292 --> 08:08.042
What else do they teach you?

08:09.042 --> 08:10.875
Delight

08:10.958 --> 08:13.375
respect, compassion.

08:13.458 --> 08:15.583
That for your actions
to be pure, they must proceed

08:15.667 --> 08:19.875
from direction, determination,
patience and strength.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.292
I'm afraid I'm still
working on patience.

08:24.667 --> 08:26.750
They taught me how to live

08:26.833 --> 08:30.000
how to breathe, how to fight

08:30.083 --> 08:31.958
and how to die.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.500
And they taught me terror.

08:37.583 --> 08:39.625
How to use it..

08:40.458 --> 08:42.417
...and how to face it.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.542
I think I'd like to hear
more about that.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.292
No. You wouldn't.

08:48.833 --> 08:51.583
[indistinct chatter]

08:52.667 --> 08:54.333
[beeping]

08:54.417 --> 08:55.625
I'm sorry, sir.

08:55.708 --> 08:58.542
Our scanners just picked up
a weapons violation.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.542
Would you step back, please?

09:01.917 --> 09:05.000
[intense music]

09:06.292 --> 09:07.542
What the hell?

09:08.625 --> 09:10.750
Look, we don't wanna hurt you.

09:10.833 --> 09:12.792
Just give us the sword, mister.

09:12.875 --> 09:15.458
Mister. Mister?

09:16.583 --> 09:18.792
Have I been gone that long?

09:18.875 --> 09:21.000
Have you forgotten everything?

09:21.083 --> 09:24.792
I am Arthur,
son of Uther Pendragon

09:24.875 --> 09:26.958
and king of the Britons.

09:28.208 --> 09:31.625
No man takes Excalibur
from me and lives.

09:36.375 --> 09:37.667
(Marcus)
Wait!

09:37.750 --> 09:40.792
- Leave him to me.
- It's alright. Let him try.

09:40.875 --> 09:42.333
It's alright.

09:44.833 --> 09:47.417
Apologies, my Lord.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.792
We weren't, uh, notified
of your return.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.833
These men mean you no harm.

09:53.917 --> 09:56.417
Your accent, you're a Briton.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.375
Yes, my Lord,
several generations removed

09:58.458 --> 09:59.667
from our splendid island

09:59.750 --> 10:01.958
but the roots run
deep nonetheless.

10:03.417 --> 10:05.917
Please, come with us.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.542
We'll send word
to Galahad and Lancelot..

10:09.458 --> 10:11.500
Galahad is dead.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.292
Lancelot is dead.

10:13.375 --> 10:15.250
Guinevere and Percival,
even Mordred

10:15.333 --> 10:17.333
all of them are dead.

10:17.417 --> 10:20.792
I have been gone a long time,
a very, very long time

10:20.875 --> 10:22.917
but I am not mad.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.917
Then set aside your sword.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.667
You're among
friends here, Arthur.

10:33.292 --> 10:34.708
(Stephen)
It's alright.

10:34.792 --> 10:36.375
- I'll take it from here.
- You're sure?

10:36.458 --> 10:38.542
Yeah, I assume full
responsibility. It's alright.

10:38.625 --> 10:40.417
- Who is this?
- A doctor.

10:40.500 --> 10:44.792
I am in no need of a doctor,
so take your leeches elsewhere.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.125
I'm..

10:47.792 --> 10:50.250
I'm just a little late,
that's all.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.125
Your journey
has been a long one.

10:52.208 --> 10:55.292
He just wishes to ensure
that you are in good health.

10:57.583 --> 11:00.208
Our captain requires this of him

11:00.292 --> 11:03.458
in deference and honor
to your position.

11:03.542 --> 11:05.292
If you refuse

11:05.375 --> 11:07.375
my friend will be
penalized harshly

11:07.458 --> 11:09.792
for failing to obey orders.

11:12.167 --> 11:13.625
Very well.

11:13.708 --> 11:16.750
I've been treated and prodded
and healed by the Nine Sisters

11:16.833 --> 11:18.875
since the year of our Lord 515.

11:18.958 --> 11:21.292
What is another healer
after that?

11:22.500 --> 11:24.708
Lead on. I will follow you.

11:32.583 --> 11:34.583
(Stephen)
You had a chance
to go over his stuff?

11:34.667 --> 11:35.958
Yes, doctor.

11:36.042 --> 11:39.000
No identification,
no travel papers.

11:39.083 --> 11:41.083
Nothing that could tell us
who he really is.

11:41.167 --> 11:44.375
[sighs]
Well, he must have ditched
his ID before the Asimov docked.

11:44.458 --> 11:45.917
Why don't you run
his fingerprints and DNA?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.417
- Maybe we'll get lucky.
- Yes, doctor.

12:00.708 --> 12:04.083
- Is there a problem?
- No. No problem.

12:04.167 --> 12:07.417
You don't believe I am
who I say I am, do you?

12:07.500 --> 12:09.167
Well, it's not for me to say.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.667
Yes, it is.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.750
Speak plainly.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.958
Alright.

12:15.042 --> 12:18.125
If you are who you say you are..

12:18.208 --> 12:20.083
...how did you get here..

12:20.167 --> 12:22.750
...1700 years after
you supposedly died?

12:27.250 --> 12:28.833
I'm not sure.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.542
The last thing I remember is

12:33.625 --> 12:36.417
lying on the field
of battle at Camlann.

12:36.500 --> 12:39.417
My brother, Sir Bedivere,
had pulled me away

12:39.500 --> 12:41.625
from these peasants
who were looting the bodies

12:41.708 --> 12:43.542
of my fallen knights.

12:44.708 --> 12:47.667
It was all King Maelgwn's fault.

12:47.750 --> 12:51.833
If he hadn't sided with Mordred
with Lancelot out of the country

12:51.917 --> 12:54.125
and, uh, Sir Gawain dead..

12:57.000 --> 12:58.833
The old wound..

13:00.167 --> 13:01.583
...reopened.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.167
[sighs]

13:04.250 --> 13:05.833
I was dying.

13:08.042 --> 13:10.000
Three times I asked Bedivere

13:10.083 --> 13:13.542
to return Excalibur
to the Lady of the Lake.

13:14.625 --> 13:17.167
I could not be taken till then.

13:21.625 --> 13:25.042
By the time he finally did
as I asked, it was..

13:25.125 --> 13:27.042
...almost too late.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.167
Then..

13:31.250 --> 13:33.750
...a barge appeared
offshore with..

13:35.958 --> 13:38.833
...three queens
and the Nine Sisters.

13:40.125 --> 13:43.583
They took me to the island
of Avalon to heal.

13:45.125 --> 13:49.250
They said that I would sleep
for a time.

13:49.333 --> 13:53.542
But that I would return
when I was most needed.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I'm not sure how I came here..

14:00.125 --> 14:02.750
...but if I am here now

14:02.833 --> 14:06.500
it's because I am most
needed here and now.

14:08.542 --> 14:09.917
(Sheridan)
'He thinks he's who?'

14:10.000 --> 14:12.250
(Marcus)
'Arthur, king of the Britons'

14:12.333 --> 14:13.750
son of Uther Pendragon

14:13.833 --> 14:15.958
heir to the throne of England

14:16.042 --> 14:18.542
and the only man allowed
to wield Excalibur.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.167
There was no King Arthur.
It's a story, that's all.

14:21.250 --> 14:22.958
(Stephen)
Well, not exactly.

14:23.042 --> 14:24.750
There's enough historical
evidence to suggest

14:24.833 --> 14:27.250
that there may have been a real
person behind those stories.

14:27.333 --> 14:31.083
Well, either way, it's pretty
obvious this guy is not Arthur.

14:31.167 --> 14:32.958
So, as interesting a diversion

14:33.042 --> 14:35.875
as this might be
our first concern right now

14:36.000 --> 14:38.625
has to be getting this treaty
worked out. Now, Michael--

14:38.708 --> 14:42.625
You know, the Vorlons
have been to Earth.

14:42.708 --> 14:46.333
And from time to time, they have
taken someone out of their time

14:46.417 --> 14:49.958
preserved him until he was
needed and revived him.

14:50.042 --> 14:53.625
Your recent encounter with
a Mr. Sebastian, for instance.

14:53.708 --> 14:55.167
You're not serious.

14:55.250 --> 14:58.167
A ship appeared
and took Arthur to a place

14:58.250 --> 15:01.458
where he would be
healed and preserved.

15:01.542 --> 15:04.708
A place from which he would
return when he was most needed.

15:04.792 --> 15:08.542
Legends are legends because they
have a certain power over us.

15:08.625 --> 15:11.583
The idea of a legend walking
in the front door, it's, uh..

15:13.375 --> 15:15.125
No, no, he is not Arthur.

15:15.208 --> 15:16.958
I mean, his speech patterns
are too contemporary.

15:17.042 --> 15:19.375
His vocabulary is all wrong.

15:19.458 --> 15:23.375
The question we should be askin'
is what made him tip over?

15:23.458 --> 15:25.208
'I've scanned his neural system.
It's fully intact.'

15:25.292 --> 15:29.167
So whatever's wrong is
functional. It's not organic.

15:29.250 --> 15:33.208
Maybe the result of a trauma
or a breakdown.

15:35.083 --> 15:37.042
What terrible thing could have
happened to drive him

15:37.125 --> 15:41.167
seventeen hundred years into the
past to find peace and meaning?

15:41.250 --> 15:43.708
[beeping]
Franklin.

15:43.792 --> 15:46.417
(female #2 on speaker)
'Doctor, the patient
you were holding in Isolab 1'

15:46.500 --> 15:49.750
'I don't know what happened
to him, but he's escaped.'

15:52.500 --> 15:55.583
[indistinct chatter]

16:00.875 --> 16:03.917
[sobbing]

16:15.292 --> 16:17.750
What troubles you, old mother?

16:17.833 --> 16:19.375
They took it.

16:19.458 --> 16:22.792
I suppose I should have known
they would sooner or later.

16:22.875 --> 16:25.208
They're always taking from us.

16:25.292 --> 16:27.917
They know Security
won't get involved.

16:29.083 --> 16:31.375
It was a picture of my husband.

16:31.458 --> 16:35.667
He died just after we came here
looking for something better.

16:36.958 --> 16:40.625
When they took the rest,
they found it.

16:42.375 --> 16:44.333
Why would they take a picture?

16:44.417 --> 16:47.917
Oh, for the frame.
It's very expensive.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.667
He told me to sell it,
but I-I couldn't.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.542
It's the last of him I had left.

16:58.875 --> 17:00.875
[sobs]

17:03.708 --> 17:05.917
Eyes as lovely as yours
were never meant

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
for tears, dear lady.

17:08.083 --> 17:10.417
Withdraw them

17:10.500 --> 17:13.333
and tell me where
I might find these men.

17:19.167 --> 17:23.583
Everything you asked for,
right in there.

17:23.667 --> 17:26.208
How can I be sure
you've contacted everyone?

17:26.292 --> 17:28.500
I'm a man of my word.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.792
You wanna pay half now,
half when you've looked it over

17:30.875 --> 17:32.167
that's fine.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.875
Look, I ain't gonna
mess this up.

17:33.958 --> 17:36.542
I bring messages back and forth
from your people on Narn

17:36.625 --> 17:39.125
and none of it's secret info
or anything.

17:39.208 --> 17:40.542
That's a sweet deal.

17:40.625 --> 17:42.708
I should think so

17:42.792 --> 17:46.250
given the price we pay
to get this past the Centauri.

17:46.750 --> 17:48.250
I..

17:48.333 --> 17:49.792
[man groans]

17:54.083 --> 17:57.833
I told you 100 credits
by yesterday

17:57.917 --> 17:59.875
or we'd beat the crap
out of you.

17:59.958 --> 18:01.958
Now why do you
make me do this, huh?

18:02.042 --> 18:06.250
Why do you make me do what
we both know I'm gonna do, huh?

18:06.333 --> 18:07.542
[man grunts]

18:07.625 --> 18:09.833
Release that man.

18:14.542 --> 18:16.042
What manner of men

18:16.125 --> 18:20.500
prey on the weak
and the poor, hmm?

18:20.583 --> 18:22.458
Stealing from old women.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.458
Cowards, I think.

18:25.542 --> 18:27.167
You'd better put
that pig sticker away

18:27.250 --> 18:29.042
before you end up eatin' it.

18:29.125 --> 18:32.083
You have something
that does not belong to you.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.750
Actually, I suspect that
you have quite a few things

18:35.833 --> 18:38.167
that do not belong to you.

18:38.250 --> 18:42.542
But let's start with a picture
and a frame.

18:45.708 --> 18:50.583
I command you to hand that over
or face the consequences.

18:51.667 --> 18:53.208
Consequences?

18:53.292 --> 18:57.500
Yeah, I got your consequences
right here.

18:59.458 --> 19:02.500
[grunting]

19:11.833 --> 19:14.125
Yield or die.

19:14.208 --> 19:16.167
Not a chance.

19:16.250 --> 19:17.708
I got friends.

19:17.792 --> 19:19.208
See?

19:21.375 --> 19:22.625
That's alright.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.167
So does he.

19:32.917 --> 19:35.250
[hisses]

19:49.083 --> 19:52.167
[instrumental music]

19:57.833 --> 19:59.208
(Garibaldi)
I want every level checked.

19:59.292 --> 20:00.708
He may be trying to find
his way off the station.

20:00.792 --> 20:02.250
But we need to cover
all our bases.

20:02.333 --> 20:04.542
He's armed, so consider him
dangerous. Don't get too close.

20:04.625 --> 20:06.708
If you find anything,
you let me know.

20:06.792 --> 20:08.292
'I got something to do.'

20:12.042 --> 20:14.458
(G'Kar)
'By G'Quan, I can't recall
the last time'

20:14.542 --> 20:16.458
'I was in a fight like that.'

20:16.542 --> 20:18.792
No moral ambiguity.

20:18.875 --> 20:24.542
No...hopeless battle against
ancient and overwhelming forces.

20:24.625 --> 20:27.000
They were the bad guys
as you say

20:27.083 --> 20:28.750
and we were the good guys.

20:28.833 --> 20:33.292
And they made a very satisfying
thump when they hit the floor.

20:33.375 --> 20:36.500
It's wrong for the strong
to prey on the weak.

20:36.583 --> 20:40.000
That idea was at the very heart
of the Round Table.

20:40.083 --> 20:42.833
To correct injustice.

20:42.917 --> 20:46.542
To promote a society
of laws, not arms.

20:46.625 --> 20:47.917
Well said.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.458
That is the purpose
which God and the crown

20:50.542 --> 20:52.500
have set before me.

20:52.583 --> 20:55.000
I cannot achieve that
locked away in some room.

20:55.083 --> 20:58.000
No, of course not.
What room?

20:58.083 --> 21:01.167
I sense in you a warrior born

21:01.250 --> 21:03.833
but a priestly manner
and refined education.

21:03.917 --> 21:05.167
Oh, well.

21:05.250 --> 21:08.458
My knights were such men as you.

21:08.542 --> 21:11.375
Well, well, not exactly
such as you.

21:11.458 --> 21:14.042
The, uh, the eyes were not..

21:14.125 --> 21:16.500
[chuckles]

21:16.583 --> 21:18.375
Oh, it matters not.

21:18.458 --> 21:23.625
You were the first to lend
your good arm to my defense

21:23.708 --> 21:27.583
and you shall sit at my right
hand at the new Round Table.

21:27.667 --> 21:29.208
And..

21:30.833 --> 21:35.208
...you shall be known
as Sir G'Kar.

21:36.875 --> 21:38.917
The Red knight.

21:43.292 --> 21:45.875
I don't know, chief. I don't
know if we should be doing this.

21:45.958 --> 21:47.292
It's my stuff.

21:47.375 --> 21:49.000
Don't worry, I'll leave
the money behind

21:49.083 --> 21:50.875
for what it should've cost.

21:50.958 --> 21:52.792
What are you so nervous about?

21:54.292 --> 21:57.458
We went up against
the entire Earth alliance

21:57.542 --> 21:58.708
and two carrier groups.

21:58.792 --> 22:00.000
Yeah, but this is
the post office.

22:00.083 --> 22:02.250
This could get us
in real trouble.

22:05.125 --> 22:06.417
[gunshot]

22:09.125 --> 22:11.750
That'll be another 20 credits
for the lock.

22:11.833 --> 22:14.875
And I am reporting this
to the postmaster general.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.250
Oh, yeah.

22:18.417 --> 22:19.667
Told you.

22:22.208 --> 22:23.875
Do you mind if I ask you a..

22:23.958 --> 22:25.667
[burps]

22:25.750 --> 22:27.042
...question?

22:27.125 --> 22:31.542
Not at all,
my good comrade in arms.

22:31.625 --> 22:36.125
You seemed to take our battle
quite, uh, personally

22:36.208 --> 22:40.500
as if what they had done
o-offended you.

22:40.583 --> 22:42.167
It did.

22:42.250 --> 22:47.292
At Camlann field,
my knights lay dying or dead.

22:49.167 --> 22:50.917
As dawn spread
across the bloody ground

22:51.000 --> 22:54.375
I saw others moving among them

22:54.458 --> 23:00.375
like specters risen
from some unholy grave.

23:00.458 --> 23:04.583
Stealing their swords,
their jewels, their crests

23:04.667 --> 23:07.458
their rings.

23:07.542 --> 23:10.250
My knights were there
because of me.

23:10.333 --> 23:12.167
I was responsible.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.750
I was responsible.

23:16.833 --> 23:19.875
[thunder rumbling]

23:25.750 --> 23:27.208
Are you alright?

23:30.125 --> 23:32.208
Oh, yes.

23:32.292 --> 23:33.833
Yes. I..

23:36.208 --> 23:37.625
It was a dream, that's all.

23:37.708 --> 23:38.875
[sniffles]

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
Battle was not intended.

23:42.083 --> 23:45.000
With our forces halved, we could
not stand against Mordred

23:45.083 --> 23:48.292
so I met with Mordred at Camlann

23:48.375 --> 23:51.792
to arrange a truce
and buy time for Lancelot

23:51.875 --> 23:53.958
to return with reinforcements.

23:56.083 --> 23:59.417
We stood there out in the open.

23:59.500 --> 24:02.750
Each of us had 14 knights
at his side.

24:04.083 --> 24:07.375
Our armies had been told
to watch and attack

24:07.458 --> 24:09.583
if someone drew a sword.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.917
We just finished
our negotiations

24:13.000 --> 24:15.833
when one of Mordred's knights

24:15.917 --> 24:19.458
saw an adder about to strike,
so he-he drew his sword.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.875
The others saw it and..

24:25.292 --> 24:26.833
[sniffles]

24:29.458 --> 24:31.250
...the killing started.

24:33.708 --> 24:35.750
It was a misunderstanding.

24:36.625 --> 24:38.500
A misinterpretation.

24:41.833 --> 24:43.917
And see what it cost us.

24:46.333 --> 24:47.792
Arthur?

24:47.875 --> 24:49.875
'We've been looking for you.'

24:49.958 --> 24:51.750
Mr. Garibaldi is quite put out.

24:51.833 --> 24:55.542
Mr. Garibaldi is always put out.

24:55.625 --> 24:59.375
I heard what you did
and I respect it.

24:59.458 --> 25:02.792
But if you don't come with me,
there will be trouble.

25:02.875 --> 25:05.375
I will vouch for his character!

25:05.458 --> 25:09.542
I saw the entire thing
because I was there.

25:09.625 --> 25:11.917
I was in it. I was..

25:15.042 --> 25:18.792
And they made
a very agreeable thump.

25:18.875 --> 25:22.375
- Or did I mention that?
- Arthur, it's the only way.

25:23.333 --> 25:24.458
Very well.

25:25.500 --> 25:28.500
I am somewhat tired anyway.

25:29.583 --> 25:31.958
I could do with some rest.

25:34.500 --> 25:38.083
Will you come with us,
Sir G'Kar?

25:38.167 --> 25:40.417
Of course. Lead on.

25:46.167 --> 25:48.125
[glass shatters]

25:52.083 --> 25:54.833
Sir Gawain had the, uh,
same problem, you know.

25:54.917 --> 25:57.125
- Did he?
- Oh, yes.

25:57.208 --> 26:00.583
Come the morning,
we'd often take one look at him

26:00.667 --> 26:03.875
and call him the Green Knight.

26:05.083 --> 26:06.792
Come, let's to it.

26:06.875 --> 26:10.000
(Sheridan)
'A lot's happened since
the last time we met here.'

26:10.083 --> 26:13.583
We declared independence
from Earth

26:13.667 --> 26:16.208
and many of you were at war
with one another.

26:17.292 --> 26:19.208
So the question becomes..

26:20.667 --> 26:23.083
...can this place continue
to serve its purpose?

26:25.083 --> 26:27.542
Well, the answer is yes.

26:28.917 --> 26:31.250
But only with your assistance.

26:31.333 --> 26:33.375
Commander?

26:33.458 --> 26:36.542
We're willing to put
a deal on the table.

26:36.625 --> 26:39.333
Babylon 5 still
has a lot to offer.

26:39.417 --> 26:43.333
We're a hub for travel,
commerce, finance.

26:43.417 --> 26:45.667
We're still considered
neutral territory.

26:47.083 --> 26:49.542
As your wars continue, some
of you may even wanna use us

26:49.625 --> 26:51.417
for peace negotiations.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.000
We'd be happy to do that.

26:53.083 --> 26:55.167
(Sheridan)
'In exchange
for our cooperation'

26:55.250 --> 26:56.958
'we ask that your governments
take part in'

26:57.042 --> 27:00.042
the ongoing defense
of Babylon 5.

27:00.125 --> 27:02.000
Obviously, we'll do
all we can to make sure

27:02.083 --> 27:05.042
that ships from two sides
actively engaged in hostilities

27:05.125 --> 27:07.833
are not providing defense
at the same time.

27:07.917 --> 27:11.375
The Babylon Treaty serves
your interests as well as ours.

27:11.458 --> 27:13.042
The details are all
spelled out in the folders

27:13.125 --> 27:14.542
I've just given you.

27:14.625 --> 27:18.042
We hope that you'll take a look
at them and think it over.

27:18.125 --> 27:20.250
- Thank you very much.
- Hmm.

27:26.167 --> 27:29.708
I think I've managed to calm
Mr. Garibaldi about our friend.

27:29.792 --> 27:33.042
G'Kar confirms he didn't
commit any crimes.

27:33.125 --> 27:36.333
Actually, uh, solved one
and prevented another.

27:37.792 --> 27:38.958
Something wrong?

27:41.125 --> 27:44.750
I took some DNA samples
from Arthur

27:44.833 --> 27:48.542
in case we might find something
in the genetic record files.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.292
You see, everyone
who joins Earthforce

27:50.375 --> 27:52.750
has his unique DNA sequence
mapped and logged

27:52.833 --> 27:54.083
for identification purposes--

27:54.167 --> 27:56.625
He was in Earthforce?
Doing what?

27:58.375 --> 27:59.500
Take a look.

28:05.667 --> 28:07.708
You can't show him this.

28:07.792 --> 28:10.625
- Marcus, it's who he is.
- I don't care. It'll kill him.

28:10.708 --> 28:12.833
W-wait now, wait now.
Let's be sensible, alright?

28:12.917 --> 28:14.875
This is the first step
towards healing him.

28:14.958 --> 28:16.292
We can't just let him
wander around

28:16.375 --> 28:17.917
the rest of his life
thinking that he's King Arthur.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.208
- Why not?
- Because this is the truth.

28:20.292 --> 28:23.542
Better the illusions that
exalt us than 10,000 truths.

28:23.625 --> 28:25.208
Alexander Pushkin, yes.

28:25.292 --> 28:27.792
Let this one truth die, Stephen.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.583
Let him be Arthur.
Let him be anybody he wants.

28:29.667 --> 28:31.167
I have an obligation to help.

28:31.250 --> 28:32.917
Now if I confront him
with this, it may be enough

28:33.000 --> 28:34.292
to snap him
out of this delusion.

28:34.375 --> 28:37.208
Your Hippocratic Oath
says do no harm.

28:37.292 --> 28:40.292
If you do this, you'll be doing
great harm, Stephen.

28:40.375 --> 28:42.292
- Stephen.
- I'm sorry.

28:42.375 --> 28:43.792
I have to.

28:48.667 --> 28:49.958
[groans]

28:55.042 --> 28:57.000
[groans]

29:07.083 --> 29:10.125
[intense music]

29:17.708 --> 29:19.417
- 'Arthur?'
- Hmm.

29:20.875 --> 29:24.167
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't sleep well last night.

29:25.250 --> 29:27.333
The dreams again.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.208
Oh, terrible dreams.

29:30.667 --> 29:35.000
The old wounds are not as
well-healed as I thought.

29:35.083 --> 29:37.542
(Stephen)
'I asked you about the picture.'

29:40.917 --> 29:44.208
Well, he seems a decent
and honorable man

29:44.292 --> 29:46.792
but I don't know him.

29:49.542 --> 29:50.875
It's you.

29:51.792 --> 29:55.667
No, I, I don't think so.

29:58.042 --> 30:00.083
"David McIntyre.

30:00.167 --> 30:01.667
"Age 52.

30:01.750 --> 30:05.250
"Serial number R27A59.

30:05.333 --> 30:07.375
"Honorable discharge
from Earthforce

30:07.458 --> 30:10.042
February 9th, 2253."

30:11.292 --> 30:12.875
'Silver star for valor.'

30:14.292 --> 30:16.917
You were at the
Battle of the Line.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.375
Twenty thousand
of our best went in

30:18.458 --> 30:20.833
and a little over
two hundred survived.

30:22.583 --> 30:26.000
'It also shows you were gunnery
sergeant on the Prometheus.'

30:27.125 --> 30:28.458
Prometheus?

30:29.792 --> 30:32.208
There were Romans
still living in my country

30:32.292 --> 30:33.875
whose family married Britons

30:33.958 --> 30:38.083
and they carried with them
legends from Greece.

30:38.167 --> 30:40.958
Prometheus brought fire
from the Gods--

30:41.042 --> 30:43.875
This Prometheus
was the first ship

30:43.958 --> 30:46.458
to encounter the Minbari.

30:46.542 --> 30:49.333
Fifteen years ago, today.

30:49.417 --> 30:50.958
'Now there was
a misunderstanding.'

30:51.042 --> 30:54.875
'The Minbari approached
with their gun ports open.'

30:54.958 --> 30:57.417
'It's a sign of respect.'

30:57.500 --> 30:59.875
'The captain, he interpreted
this as a threat.'

30:59.958 --> 31:01.958
'He panicked.'

31:02.042 --> 31:05.250
(male #2)
'Eight thousand clicks,
seven thousand.'

31:05.333 --> 31:06.792
'They're coming in.
Gun ports are open.'

31:06.875 --> 31:08.958
'Repeat, gun ports are open.'

31:09.042 --> 31:11.708
'Presume attack vector.'

31:11.792 --> 31:13.250
(Stephen)
Because
of this misinterpretation

31:13.333 --> 31:15.250
he ordered his crew to attack.

31:15.333 --> 31:17.833
(male #2)
'Forward batteries, open fire.'

31:17.917 --> 31:19.583
[gunfire]

31:20.875 --> 31:22.375
[explosion]

31:23.708 --> 31:26.542
This has nothing to do with me.

31:26.625 --> 31:28.708
And the attack destroyed
two Minbari vessels

31:28.792 --> 31:29.958
and killed their leader Dukhat

31:30.042 --> 31:31.750
and started
the Earth-Minbari war.

31:31.833 --> 31:33.792
Now you were gunnery sergeant
on the Prometheus.

31:33.875 --> 31:35.708
- You fired those shots.
- No.

31:35.792 --> 31:37.875
It was the sword
that struck the adder

31:37.958 --> 31:39.125
that started the battle.

31:39.208 --> 31:41.125
'No, it was not a sword.
It was a ship.'

31:41.208 --> 31:42.542
A sword.

31:42.625 --> 31:44.958
The light shining off it.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.125
Oh.

31:51.208 --> 31:53.875
The review board absolved you
of all responsibility

31:53.958 --> 31:56.917
for following the orders
of your commanding officer.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.625
Now despite bouts of depression

31:58.708 --> 32:01.125
that continue to get
longer and more intense

32:01.208 --> 32:03.500
you were put back
into active duty.

32:03.583 --> 32:06.208
We needed everyone
we could get back then.

32:06.292 --> 32:08.542
And you made it all the way.

32:08.625 --> 32:10.667
You volunteered
for the Battle of the Line

32:10.750 --> 32:13.458
even though you knew
it was a suicide mission.

32:15.083 --> 32:19.458
This man you describe..

32:19.542 --> 32:22.167
'...he had
no business surviving.'

32:22.250 --> 32:24.333
A quarter of a million
men and women

32:24.417 --> 32:26.667
dead on the battlefield..

32:28.083 --> 32:31.708
...at Camlann.

32:31.792 --> 32:35.000
- No, no, not Camlann.
- No, not Camlann.

32:35.083 --> 32:38.042
They died in the Minbari war.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.958
- I was responsible.
- No.

32:42.042 --> 32:43.500
Responsible for my knights

32:43.583 --> 32:45.708
and for those who followed me
into battle.

32:45.792 --> 32:49.500
Their armor was not strong
enough to protect them.

32:50.542 --> 32:52.833
Their horses..

32:52.917 --> 32:55.417
Their horses were on fire.

32:57.667 --> 33:00.708
[intense music]

33:02.125 --> 33:04.208
[sobs]

33:12.333 --> 33:13.792
The old wound.

33:14.625 --> 33:16.708
The old wound, yes.

33:17.833 --> 33:19.375
The pain of memory.

33:19.458 --> 33:21.042
It's alright now.

33:21.125 --> 33:23.208
You can face it.
We can face it together.

33:23.292 --> 33:26.750
No, I can never rest.

33:26.833 --> 33:29.792
The pain will never go away.

33:32.500 --> 33:36.208
I must return Excalibur
to the Lady of the Lake.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.917
I didn't..

33:40.000 --> 33:41.625
[sighs]

33:41.708 --> 33:43.333
I didn't know.

33:44.583 --> 33:47.042
We didn't know.

33:49.250 --> 33:51.292
You couldn't know.

33:51.375 --> 33:52.583
Bodies..

33:54.083 --> 33:55.208
...slain.

33:56.333 --> 33:57.667
The dying.

33:59.208 --> 34:01.542
Bodies drifting..

34:01.625 --> 34:03.292
...like stars.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.708
My fault.

34:08.208 --> 34:10.292
He deserves to die.

34:14.042 --> 34:15.792
My fault.

34:19.958 --> 34:23.000
[dramatic music]

34:24.917 --> 34:27.958
[screams]

34:33.792 --> 34:35.208
David?

34:39.875 --> 34:41.083
David?

34:42.042 --> 34:43.917
Can you hear me?

34:45.042 --> 34:46.917
Can you hear me?

34:49.792 --> 34:50.875
David.

34:52.375 --> 34:53.667
David.

35:03.875 --> 35:05.000
Anything yet?

35:05.083 --> 35:06.708
I just got word
from the Drazi Ambassador.

35:06.792 --> 35:09.208
He's been appointed spokesman
for what's left of the league.

35:09.292 --> 35:12.083
A number of them refused to sign
the Mutual Defense Treaty

35:12.167 --> 35:13.792
but the rest of 'em signed on.

35:13.875 --> 35:15.750
Do we have enough
to make it work?

35:15.833 --> 35:17.917
With room to spare.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
[chuckles]

35:20.083 --> 35:21.500
Oh, my God, it's almost
enough to make you start

35:21.583 --> 35:22.958
believing in miracles, isn't it?

35:23.042 --> 35:24.167
Yes, sir.

35:24.250 --> 35:26.000
Almost.

35:26.083 --> 35:28.375
Why? What happened?

35:43.875 --> 35:45.542
You know you'd think
I'd learn one of these days

35:45.625 --> 35:48.250
that I can't fix everything,
but it never happens.

35:49.292 --> 35:50.833
Now, I..

35:52.917 --> 35:54.208
I gave him back the sword.

35:54.292 --> 35:56.583
I, I figured maybe it'd help,
but it didn't.

35:57.542 --> 36:00.250
One thing I don't understand.

36:00.333 --> 36:02.500
Why did he come here?

36:02.583 --> 36:04.458
It wasn't an accident.

36:04.542 --> 36:06.292
He got onboard a transport.
He bought a ticket.

36:06.375 --> 36:07.667
There must have been a reason

36:07.750 --> 36:09.542
even if he couldn't
admit it to himself.

36:09.625 --> 36:11.417
Well, obviously,
it had something to do

36:11.500 --> 36:13.792
with the anniversary of his
attack on the Minbari ship.

36:13.875 --> 36:15.458
I mean, that's where
it all started.

36:15.542 --> 36:17.375
According to you, yes.

36:17.458 --> 36:19.500
He still thinks
it was the sword.

36:20.833 --> 36:24.417
Well, a ship, a sword,
what's the difference?

36:24.500 --> 36:26.958
None, none at all.

36:29.083 --> 36:30.625
Excalibur.

36:30.708 --> 36:32.375
The symbol of the king.

36:32.458 --> 36:34.625
Yeah, but in this case

36:34.708 --> 36:38.167
the symbol of the ship

36:38.250 --> 36:39.667
and his pain.

36:41.167 --> 36:43.958
Wh-what's the story
of Sir Bedivere?

36:44.750 --> 36:46.125
Arthur's journey began

36:46.208 --> 36:49.708
when the Lady of the Lake
gave him the Excalibur.

36:49.792 --> 36:52.083
As he lay dying,
he asked Bedivere

36:52.167 --> 36:55.417
to return Excalibur
to the Lady of the Lake.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.083
The ladies couldn't
take him to Avalon

36:57.167 --> 36:59.917
couldn't heal him
until this was done.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.625
He had to go full circle
right back to where he started.

37:03.708 --> 37:08.750
Now, now he said he couldn't
know peace or rest

37:08.833 --> 37:12.292
until the lady
took back Excalibur.

37:12.375 --> 37:15.083
The king's burden.

37:15.167 --> 37:17.583
- The king's pain.
- Yeah.

37:17.667 --> 37:19.625
That's why he came here.

37:19.708 --> 37:23.000
To find someone willing
to take away his pain.

37:24.458 --> 37:27.208
But if that's Excalibur

37:27.292 --> 37:29.125
and you're Bedivere

37:29.208 --> 37:31.208
who's the Lady of the Lake?

37:32.458 --> 37:35.583
[instrumental music]

38:04.458 --> 38:07.500
[dramatic music]

38:37.458 --> 38:40.542
[music continues]

39:16.042 --> 39:18.458
I knew you'd come
to your senses, sooner or later.

39:18.542 --> 39:20.250
Hundred credits ain't
too much when you stop

39:20.333 --> 39:22.417
to think about it, now, is it?

39:22.500 --> 39:24.417
Yes, sir, first thing
I learned is

39:24.500 --> 39:26.125
never mess with the post office.

39:26.208 --> 39:29.125
You'll come a cropper
every time.

39:29.208 --> 39:33.708
Okay, let's see. Where's that,
uh, where's that box?

39:33.792 --> 39:35.583
There we are.

39:40.042 --> 39:41.458
Oops.

39:41.542 --> 39:43.792
[chuckles]

39:46.125 --> 39:48.250
Sorry. A little
post office humor.

39:48.333 --> 39:50.792
[laughs]
Hang on. I'll get your one.

39:55.250 --> 39:57.083
There we go. There you are.

39:57.167 --> 39:58.625
Anything else I can do for you?

39:58.708 --> 40:00.000
Some stamps?

40:00.083 --> 40:01.333
Thanks. No.

40:01.417 --> 40:04.000
Oh, uh, before I forget

40:04.083 --> 40:05.375
you do realize
that we've cut off

40:05.458 --> 40:07.042
all contact with Earth, right?

40:07.125 --> 40:08.333
Of course, I realize that.

40:08.417 --> 40:10.417
You're not dealing with
a chimp here, you know.

40:10.500 --> 40:12.000
And if you, and if
you hadn't done that

40:12.083 --> 40:14.000
all the prices wouldn't have
gone up now, would they?

40:14.083 --> 40:16.958
I-I was just thinking,
before we broke away

40:17.042 --> 40:19.458
the rent on this place,
your quarters

40:19.542 --> 40:21.958
all that was being paid
for by Earth, right?

40:22.042 --> 40:23.875
But since they're out
of the picture

40:23.958 --> 40:25.708
who's paying for all this now?

40:25.792 --> 40:28.333
Well, I-I-I, um, if, you know--

40:28.417 --> 40:31.417
Now I might be inclined
to overlook this

40:31.500 --> 40:33.958
in light of the morale boost
it gives folks to get mail

40:34.042 --> 40:35.333
'from back home.'

40:35.417 --> 40:40.083
- How much?
- One hundred and one credits.

40:40.167 --> 40:43.250
That ain't so much when you stop
to think about it, now is it?

40:56.583 --> 40:59.167
I wish I could say
this was a good idea.

40:59.250 --> 41:00.833
It's what I want to do.

41:00.917 --> 41:03.083
I think it's what I need to do.

41:03.167 --> 41:05.417
My people will treat
him well, doctor.

41:05.500 --> 41:07.417
He will be welcomed
and put in a position

41:07.500 --> 41:09.542
of authority in the resistance.

41:09.625 --> 41:13.375
He has good ideas about
raising up those in need

41:13.458 --> 41:15.708
about organizing others
into something better

41:15.792 --> 41:18.750
and nobler
than they had been before.

41:18.833 --> 41:22.708
We are in great need
of such ideas and such men.

41:22.792 --> 41:25.167
A new Round Table?

41:25.250 --> 41:28.500
Well, I guess I've heard
worse ideas in my time.

41:28.583 --> 41:30.292
I just wish you could stay
just a little longer

41:30.375 --> 41:31.917
until we can be sure
you're okay.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.250
Doctor, I'm healed.

41:34.333 --> 41:36.875
Soul and body knitted together.

41:38.292 --> 41:41.250
One journey has ended,
another beckons.

41:41.333 --> 41:44.875
(man on PA)
'Transport Bokalla is now
boarding outbound passengers.'

41:44.958 --> 41:47.083
That's your ship.
I'll walk you out.

41:49.292 --> 41:50.958
Thank you, doctor.

41:52.167 --> 41:53.583
Take care.

41:54.208 --> 41:55.625
And you.

41:59.042 --> 42:00.458
And you.

42:02.708 --> 42:03.958
Where were you?

42:04.042 --> 42:06.000
I hate goodbyes.

42:06.083 --> 42:09.542
Just wanted to watch him go
remembering Arthur.

42:11.333 --> 42:14.333
Where my people come from,
his story has great power.

42:15.750 --> 42:17.000
I'll miss him.

42:18.292 --> 42:20.083
Even if he wasn't Arthur?

42:20.167 --> 42:21.750
Now, now.

42:21.833 --> 42:24.500
Next thing you'll be saying
is he's not Merlin.

42:26.042 --> 42:27.750
Merlin was a great teacher,
you know.

42:27.833 --> 42:30.333
- I'm not hearing this.
- They say he aged backwards.

42:30.417 --> 42:32.625
That was how he was able
to foretell the future

42:32.708 --> 42:34.042
by remembering it.

42:34.125 --> 42:36.292
Which means he came
from the future.

42:36.375 --> 42:40.000
Maybe he had Arthur form the
Round Table by remembering us.

42:40.083 --> 42:42.375
'We're forming one of our own,
after all.'

42:42.458 --> 42:44.792
Which makes you Percival.

42:44.875 --> 42:47.458
I'm Galahad,
him being sinless and all.

42:48.208 --> 42:50.625
Sheridan as Arthur.

42:50.708 --> 42:52.625
Ivanova, perhaps Gawain.

42:52.708 --> 42:55.167
I think we both know
who Mordred is.

42:55.250 --> 42:57.167
So the question is

42:57.250 --> 42:59.583
who is Morgana Le Fay?

43:05.125 --> 43:07.542
