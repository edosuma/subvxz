00:51.520 --> 00:55.040
Believe it or not, we've been trying
this case for four months today.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.880
It started May 5th, it's September 5th.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.760
We're not paying
any more money, so forget about it.

01:00.840 --> 01:03.080
So, actually the reason for this--

01:03.160 --> 01:06.040
The reason for this meeting
is so everyone knows we're quitting.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.680
- We... We did the cross.
- Done your part.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.280
That's right.
Hey, I can't do anymore, I'm tired.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.080
Alright, so...

01:14.440 --> 01:15.400
Um...

01:16.040 --> 01:19.640
this, to me, is not
an academic exercise at all,

01:19.720 --> 01:22.320
because I have a real question in my mind

01:22.920 --> 01:26.000
about A, whether we should put on
any evidence at all,

01:27.640 --> 01:28.840
and B,

01:29.640 --> 01:32.360
if we should put on evidence,
what it should be.

01:33.040 --> 01:37.040
The one thing I have absolutely no doubt
in my mind about

01:37.120 --> 01:40.560
in this particular topic
is that you shouldn't testify.

01:40.640 --> 01:44.040
I don't see any upside to that
and I see lots of downsides,

01:44.120 --> 01:47.160
but obviously, Mike,
this is your decision.

01:47.520 --> 01:51.040
This is your life. Whether you should
testify is your call, ultimately.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.400
So, let's start with Bill
and just go around the table,

01:54.480 --> 01:56.160
and hear what people have to say.

01:57.920 --> 02:00.240
First of all, I think I would
definitely put on a defense,

02:00.320 --> 02:02.480
that's the first issue
that we need to decide.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.200
I think there's a couple of jurors

02:05.440 --> 02:09.039
who I think who are leaning
to a conviction at this point.

02:09.160 --> 02:13.360
And I think that the experts
that we've hired

02:13.440 --> 02:17.080
and the theories that they've come up with
and the way they explain things

02:17.160 --> 02:19.440
are so compelling
that it may shift those two jurors.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.160
So, I think we need to help
some of these jurors along.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.720
- Todd.
- Clearly you need a defense.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.920
Prior to Radisch's testimony,

02:28.400 --> 02:31.240
I feel that everybody
would've voted not guilty.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.680
Radisch's testimony was quite effective
with at least three jurors,

02:37.040 --> 02:38.400
notably Rogers.

02:39.160 --> 02:44.080
And it will take medical testimony
to get her back on the not guilty side.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.360
- OK. Ron?
- We're in a hell of a good position

02:47.720 --> 02:51.400
just with the prosecution's evidence in.
Would we get an acquittal?

02:51.640 --> 02:54.920
I don't know. I believe we
definitely would get a hung jury.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.760
Then you get a hung lawyer.

02:56.840 --> 03:00.160
'Cause I'm not going through this again.
Sorry, Mike.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.880
I just don't see a conviction,
but I see a hung jury at this point.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.600
I don't see an acquittal.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.080
- OK.
- And that's a gamble that

03:08.720 --> 03:09.680
we have to take.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.280
I want to say something else, and that is
that you are not universally liked.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.720
I know that may come
as a great shock to you.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.280
I think there's a couple of people
on the jury

03:18.360 --> 03:21.760
that actually don't like you very much.
You are perceived as very slick.

03:21.840 --> 03:24.640
You know, very oily,
by them, I think.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.760
You know, it's the old theme:
he's got a lot of money,

03:28.080 --> 03:30.000
most of which we've given to you.

03:30.480 --> 03:34.600
And we've hired
high-powered defense to get him off.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.960
Well, you're not going to have permission
to put that particular segment...

03:38.840 --> 03:39.800
in the film.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.400
Because one of David--

03:41.720 --> 03:43.960
Because of one of David's
overriding morals

03:45.000 --> 03:47.520
for every day of his life
that I've known him,

03:47.600 --> 03:49.840
has been for everyone to love him
all the time.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.880
In that case,
can I be excused now?

03:54.160 --> 03:55.160
Um...

03:56.800 --> 03:57.640
Tom.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.240
One of the burdens
of putting on defense

04:00.320 --> 04:03.640
is you lose some of the reasonable doubt
argument you otherwise have.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.440
If you put experts on you are under
some burden to prove something,

04:07.520 --> 04:11.520
and it becomes a little bit more
of an equal match. I think Radisch,

04:11.720 --> 04:15.600
she's got some very basic things she says
that no cross can take away.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.839
Somebody else has to come
and take away.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.360
These seven lacerations
or seven separate blows?

04:20.440 --> 04:22.200
But you got to have somebody else

04:22.280 --> 04:25.320
explain either how that can happen
or that they aren't seven impacts.

04:25.400 --> 04:29.160
So, I think there's probably some
basic stuff, at least on the medicine,

04:29.320 --> 04:31.000
- that needs to be answered.
- Mike.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.200
I agree that...

04:33.160 --> 04:35.400
we need a defense, if only...

04:35.720 --> 04:41.280
to answer some of the questions
that Radisch raised and...

04:41.720 --> 04:45.360
to fill in a couple of the holes
that the people might have.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.360
- OK. OK.
- But not much.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.840
I mean, here's the truth.

04:48.920 --> 04:53.200
The two or three points the jury's
going to trip the most on is...

04:55.640 --> 04:58.040
the number of lacerations.

04:58.120 --> 05:00.840
How the fuck do you get

05:01.000 --> 05:04.520
these many lacerations
in these locations

05:04.840 --> 05:06.960
from falling down the stairs?

05:07.040 --> 05:10.360
- That was a main thing...
- The only thing you got to prove,

05:10.520 --> 05:13.400
as far as I'm concerned,
is that it wasn't that damn blow poke,

05:13.680 --> 05:16.320
They have fucking
married themselves...

05:16.400 --> 05:17.760
- Yeah, they are.
- I know.

05:17.840 --> 05:20.080
- So therefore...
- Deborah Radisch...

05:20.400 --> 05:23.920
I mean, it's like Super Glue
at this point, I mean, it...

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
- It was hot solid...
- The bottom line is that I think,

05:28.120 --> 05:31.240
you know,  I can get up there
in closing argument and say,

05:32.120 --> 05:37.120
"Let's just cut to the chase here.
If you have a reasonable doubt

05:37.720 --> 05:43.680
about whether that blow poke was in
the house on December 9th, 2001,

05:44.240 --> 05:45.560
it's not guilty."

05:45.640 --> 05:48.520
No, no, we need
a Johnnie Cochran phrase.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.560
- I've got one.
- What is it? I've got a better one.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.600
If it don't blow, he must go.

05:54.920 --> 05:58.480
If it ain't the poke...
If it ain't the poke, he ain't the bloke.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.520
If he ain't the poke,
he's not going to the poke.

06:07.120 --> 06:07.960
How about...

06:08.640 --> 06:11.680
Deaver's got no hair
and the proof ain't there?

06:29.720 --> 06:32.040
Welcome again. Nice to see you.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.360
I'm tired. I'm exhausted.

06:36.800 --> 06:37.960
This is my brother.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.240
- My brother Bill.
- How are you?

06:41.920 --> 06:43.600
- And my son Todd.
- Hi, Henry.

06:43.840 --> 06:44.920
Nice to meet you.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.080
- And my son Todd.
- Hi.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.800
Deaver says,
"All going same direction."

06:59.880 --> 07:02.280
No, there's totally
two different directions.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.400
- Opposite directions.
- Right.

07:05.040 --> 07:08.480
These two drops, opposite direction.
Also, different angles.

07:08.760 --> 07:09.600
Right.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.920
- There's one here.
- This is a...

07:13.920 --> 07:15.680
- A drop here.
- Those are... these two

07:16.320 --> 07:18.040
- are the same direction.
- Right.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.520
Deaver says all of these.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.760
This, this, that, and that

07:24.880 --> 07:26.280
all cast-off

07:27.440 --> 07:28.640
from a blow over here.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.080
- From the same...
- Same event.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.400
Same event.

07:33.640 --> 07:34.800
Impossible.

07:40.840 --> 07:44.440
- Should be 84. Yeah.
- Eighty four exactly. Eighty four.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.600
- Eighty four, huh?
- Now, they say he's here.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.800
Five inches off this.

07:52.440 --> 07:56.440
How do you end swinging the blow poke
from over there,

07:56.520 --> 07:59.040
- from outside?
- It's almost impossible.

07:59.560 --> 08:03.120
So, you can swing from the inside
and we should see cast-off spatter.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.040
Right.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.520
Five inches.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.560
- Right.
- Let me do that then.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.480
She is five feet two,
sixty-two inches.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.560
That's just 62 inches.

08:20.840 --> 08:22.000
Hit here.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.840
So, that can cause a multi-fracture now.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.360
- Multi-laceration?
- Laceration now. And...

08:29.920 --> 08:33.200
then she tried to somehow,
dizzy and fall,

08:33.360 --> 08:36.840
sit here, maybe fall here.
And coughing.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.400
Breathing, OK?

08:41.280 --> 08:42.760
That's why all the spatter.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.720
Somehow, later, the shoulder touch here.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.360
Probably can't get support,

08:48.440 --> 08:52.320
that's why you have
so many fingerprints here on the side.

08:52.440 --> 08:53.600
Just like this.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.560
Here, more likely, just...
she already on the ground. Like this.

08:58.640 --> 08:59.760
- Something like that.
- Right.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.400
- OK? Meanwhile, coughing...
- Right.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.040
...bleeding, so...

09:05.120 --> 09:07.040
-
- Yeah, exactly.

09:07.640 --> 09:11.800
- So, that's why that's the shadowy effect.
- Right.

09:11.880 --> 09:15.240
You know, the bottom line here
is accidental fall.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.880
It's not consistent with a beating.
That's the bottom line.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.840
Looks like a long night.

09:35.760 --> 09:38.440
I think I want to start with,
"Are you aware

09:38.840 --> 09:42.760
that Agent Deaver has given this jury
the opinion that

09:43.200 --> 09:45.800
the blood staining in that stairway

09:48.200 --> 09:51.360
indicates... indicates it's a beating?"
"Yes, I know that."

09:51.440 --> 09:53.080
"Do you agree with that?"
"No."

09:53.720 --> 09:56.600
"Do you have an opinion as to whether
it's more consistent with the beating

09:56.680 --> 09:59.080
or more consistent with an accident?"
"Yes."

09:59.680 --> 10:01.920
That's the last question.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.760
Well, I'm going to come back--
You want to say that? OK.

10:06.840 --> 10:10.160
Because you have to build up
all these lines.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.520
Why you want to start with...

10:15.560 --> 10:18.000
Just so the jury understands
that you're there

10:18.840 --> 10:19.960
to disagree with him.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.680
You don't have to have them understand.

10:24.800 --> 10:27.160
I'm here, basically disagree. If I...

10:28.240 --> 10:29.800
If I agree, I don't show up.

10:37.640 --> 10:40.200
That shows the direction.
Do you see what I mean?

10:42.640 --> 10:45.000
That's how we know which direction.

10:47.440 --> 10:53.480
And now we're going to move
into medium velocity.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.200
That's a cast-off pattern.

10:55.480 --> 11:00.200
The cast-off pattern,
it changes along the line.

11:01.160 --> 11:04.160
The ratio lends a width.

11:04.280 --> 11:08.480
You can't just, based on one drop,
say that's a cast-off.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.080
Can be any possibility.

11:31.160 --> 11:34.360
Henry, they're gonna
send me in the morning.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.360
It's good.

11:36.720 --> 11:37.600
It's good.

11:38.160 --> 11:41.920
- Just that little much hair.
- That much hair did all that?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Nah.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.800
No, this hair... Each time, you see?

11:49.720 --> 11:51.040
- You see that?
- Yeah.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.280
What would it...
would it be coughing?

11:53.680 --> 11:54.520
Hm?

11:54.600 --> 11:56.680
- What's for the coughing?
- Ink.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.080
- Come on.
- Ketchup.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.280
Or Jello.
You have your choice.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.120
OK, Ron, you do it.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.080
See, maybe your cough
is better than mine.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.760
- Which one is ketchup?
- This is ketchup.

12:28.640 --> 12:29.960
You swallow it!

12:32.520 --> 12:34.520
Now I got to get
my carpet cleaned!

12:35.880 --> 12:37.640
That's a bad experiment.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.360
Right.44

12:55.360 --> 12:58.880
Now, if something in motion.
Can you hold this?

12:59.440 --> 13:01.440
I hope this it's not a new suit.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.880
Let's say I have a weapon.

13:05.240 --> 13:08.000
Weapon have some blood here.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.400
I got you.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.400
Now, you have a cast-off pattern.

13:16.680 --> 13:17.760
Cast-off pattern,

13:18.840 --> 13:19.920
as you can see,

13:20.440 --> 13:24.320
is a line of formation.
You'll have to look at the totality.

13:24.640 --> 13:27.280
You can't just pick one,
say that's the one.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.120
When I look at the staircase ceiling,

13:30.360 --> 13:34.240
as you probably recall,
it has a cat picture on the north wall,

13:34.600 --> 13:36.920
above the picture,

13:37.320 --> 13:41.600
and nothing on the higher point
of this area.

13:42.120 --> 13:46.800
So, if an individual with a weapon,

13:47.320 --> 13:49.480
say 40 inches long,

13:49.960 --> 13:50.960
hitting...

13:51.320 --> 13:55.080
I should see something on the ceiling,
cast-off pattern.

13:55.360 --> 13:59.600
Some maybe argue, say,
could be chop the weapon a little bit.

13:59.680 --> 14:06.040
But if you do that, you very difficult
not to get some blood spatter

14:06.120 --> 14:09.480
on whoever... suspect's clothing.

14:10.120 --> 14:14.520
Focusing on that for a second,
did you inspect Mr. Peterson's shirt?

14:14.600 --> 14:18.720
Yes, I did inspect
Michael Peterson's shirt.

14:18.800 --> 14:22.800
It's a dark blue shirt. It's very
difficult to see with naked eyes.

14:23.360 --> 14:26.640
So what we did,
use a higher magnification

14:26.760 --> 14:28.400
and use light sources,

14:28.520 --> 14:33.720
and tried to look at any area,
see any spatter or not.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.640
I did not find any blood spatter.

14:37.360 --> 14:40.600
Did you observe anything in the scene
that was inconsistent

14:41.040 --> 14:45.040
with Kathleen Peterson having died
from an accident in that stairway?

14:45.280 --> 14:49.120
When we look at a blood spatter pattern,
we have to look at the totality,

14:49.440 --> 14:51.440
the whole pattern,

14:51.720 --> 14:56.640
instead of jumping to...
focus on one small drop.

14:57.080 --> 15:01.840
Just like you go to a forest, you want to
see the whole forest first,

15:01.920 --> 15:04.080
before we examine individual trees.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.240
Location one,
we can see this area contact.

15:09.920 --> 15:14.880
That's another contact, and coming
downwards. The blood goes downwards.

15:15.240 --> 15:18.040
We have some spatter in this area,

15:18.240 --> 15:22.440
which photo did not really show up.
Some spatter on the wall, too.

15:23.520 --> 15:28.840
This consistent with Kathleen.
Head more likely hit the moulding,

15:28.920 --> 15:30.080
have some spatter.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.920
Now, location number two.

15:33.160 --> 15:36.680
Here the majority, this portion of it,

15:36.880 --> 15:42.920
is a multiple deposit of stains,
smear, spatter, wipe and swipe pattern.

15:43.080 --> 15:47.360
The rest of that, we see spatter goes
all different directions.

15:48.160 --> 15:52.480
Multiple, as I say,
approximately four thousand,

15:53.160 --> 15:54.000
or more.

15:54.960 --> 16:00.160
So, in a beating,
you don't create that much blood spatter.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.400
This, based on my experience,
has to be multiple origin.

16:04.960 --> 16:08.840
Coughing, shaking her hair,
shaking her hand, moving around.

16:10.640 --> 16:15.200
Maybe some impact spatter there,
but everything is all together.

16:15.960 --> 16:20.880
Dr. Lee, based on your education
and your training and your experience

16:20.960 --> 16:24.160
and on your own observations
and findings in this case,

16:24.920 --> 16:28.680
do you have an opinion to a reasonable
degree of scientific certainty

16:29.640 --> 16:32.320
as to whether the totality
of the evidence

16:33.120 --> 16:34.000
in this case,

16:34.840 --> 16:38.000
from the scene,
is more consistent  with a beating

16:38.640 --> 16:40.720
or is more consistent
with an accident?

16:41.680 --> 16:43.760
It's more consistent with an accident.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.640
That's all I have. Thank you, Doctor.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.200
Let's take a 15-minute break.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.120
Now...

16:56.840 --> 17:00.440
do you recall having a series
of conversations with Agent Deaver

17:00.520 --> 17:05.359
after having looked at the model
and seeing the targets that he created

17:05.520 --> 17:08.960
- and looking at the test closely?
- I did have some conversations with him.

17:09.040 --> 17:14.599
Do you recall telling him that you had
traveled around the United States

17:15.079 --> 17:18.400
and that this was some of the best work
that you had seen?

17:18.480 --> 17:21.200
I tell him something,
"He did some good work."

17:21.480 --> 17:26.359
And the model is beautiful,
but the model did not prove anything.

17:26.440 --> 17:30.600
Let me show a copy of your book.
You recall giving him a copy of your book?

17:31.080 --> 17:35.040
Yes, I generally give everybody
a copy of book. I want them to learn.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.480
Do you recall...

17:37.320 --> 17:40.440
signing an inscription
with a note to Agent Deaver,

17:40.720 --> 17:42.720
- in this book when you were there?
- Yes.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.800
If you would, please,
read what the note says.

17:45.640 --> 17:46.680
It says...

17:47.160 --> 17:51.280
"To Duane Deaver, one of the best.
Keep up with your good work.

17:51.640 --> 17:53.480
With warm regards, Henry Lee."

17:57.920 --> 18:00.920
You probably found thousands
of these sent.

18:04.120 --> 18:07.160
But you wouldn't give it to him
unless you had felt that way, would you?

18:07.240 --> 18:11.280
No, no, I give everybody courtesy,
that's Chinese culture.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.240
I went to his place.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.560
He extended a courtesy,
let me see what he has.

18:16.840 --> 18:17.800
That's my...

18:19.200 --> 18:22.160
upbringing, respect other people.
I give him a book.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.640
I cannot write, say, "You're..."

18:26.440 --> 18:27.720
I don't want to say.

18:28.240 --> 18:33.000
You can't write on a book, say somebody,
"You totally wrong," or something.

18:34.360 --> 18:37.240
What are you going to write?
His conclusion is wrong,

18:37.320 --> 18:38.800
but he tried very hard.

18:38.880 --> 18:43.880
I can't say he didn't try to do good work.
Agent Deaver did a lot of work.

18:44.640 --> 18:47.800
So, you're agreeing then
that he did good work?

18:48.280 --> 18:49.520
I did...

18:51.000 --> 18:54.360
What do you want me to say?
"He did lousy work," on a book?

18:54.480 --> 18:55.960
I cannot say that.

18:56.480 --> 18:59.280
Just like I give Mr. Rudolf a book,

18:59.360 --> 19:02.520
I say, "You're one of the best attorneys."
But he's lousy and...

19:03.240 --> 19:05.760
- I still give him that book, and...
-

19:09.880 --> 19:13.040
- Now, based on all that you saw...
- Yes.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.240
and all that you did,
or all that you didn't do,

19:15.680 --> 19:18.880
is it your testimony before this jury

19:19.160 --> 19:24.280
that you can absolutely,
conclusively exclude...

19:26.040 --> 19:28.480
that Kathleen Peterson was beaten

19:29.480 --> 19:30.320
on her head?

19:30.920 --> 19:37.000
I say my conclusion is more consistent
with an accidental falling.

19:37.080 --> 19:40.160
But you can't exclude
that she was beaten,

19:40.320 --> 19:44.080
- based on all you did...
- Nobody can't exclude everything.

19:44.640 --> 19:48.400
But the pattern tells me, the indications,

19:48.480 --> 19:52.080
everything more consistent as an accident.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.160
Court TV called me.

19:56.160 --> 19:59.720
And they want some documents
you said you have,

19:59.800 --> 20:01.680
- I guess it's from this library stuff.
- Yeah.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.360
Well, I guess they're too lazy
to do all the work you've done.

20:04.440 --> 20:05.360
- Well, I...
- Yeah.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.040
This has taken a lot of work.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.720
Nobody wanted to go through these boxes.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.680
I'm not giving her everything, only
the one that I mentioned to her.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.880
Unless she does
something really nice for me.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.240
And then I'll give her the one I gave
to Jim Hardin today.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.640
Well, she bought you a very nice dinner.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.480
Yeah, yeah. That's true,

20:24.120 --> 20:25.360
But I didn't ask her to.

20:25.840 --> 20:26.720
That's true.

20:29.760 --> 20:33.760
Let me see what it is.
I can probably see as much-- Four of 11.

20:33.840 --> 20:34.720
Great.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.440
Boy, this is nicely organized.

20:45.720 --> 20:49.040
What I find really amazing about all this
is that he kept

20:49.720 --> 20:52.520
so much of his life
from such a young age that he...

20:54.240 --> 20:55.800
I guess he is narcissistic.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.640
"You cannot kill and be unaffected.

21:00.640 --> 21:03.240
Like an animal who first tastes blood,
so is a man who kills.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.320
He is forever disposed to that thirst.

21:05.920 --> 21:09.120
When he sees how simple is the act.
he is forever disposed to that thirst.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.600
Perhaps he will never kill again
or ever want to,

21:11.680 --> 21:14.000
but always in his mind
is the knowledge of the act.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.400
The awareness of its simplicity.

21:21.240 --> 21:25.120
The peculiar remember...
reminder of elation,

21:25.200 --> 21:27.280
sexuality that accompanied the deed

21:27.520 --> 21:30.560
and, too, that he was licensed, rewarded,
or simply never caught."

21:30.640 --> 21:32.240
Where the heck was that published?

21:32.600 --> 21:35.840
This... See this, he talks about
frizzle in here. This is...

21:36.440 --> 21:38.400
This is his A Time of War book.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.760
- I'll put it back with the others.
- Oh no, that's--

21:41.840 --> 21:44.360
I don't know why it stuck
with this, but that's where I found it.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.600
Death and sexuality are a bit of...

21:47.760 --> 21:49.960
I copied one of these things here
that says

21:50.720 --> 21:54.960
sex and violence are always intertwined
in his books. And believe me, they are.

21:55.560 --> 21:56.400
Well...

21:56.480 --> 21:58.440
But he's been adding to this periodically.

21:58.520 --> 22:02.880
Well, if you read through it, you'll see
there's some homosexual military stuff.

22:03.080 --> 22:03.920
OK.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.240
It's like in everything he writes.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.600
Is the word "autobiography"
used on it in any place?

22:11.040 --> 22:13.200
- No.
- No. You don't actually see that word?

22:14.240 --> 22:17.200
Does he refer to himself
in first person singular?

22:17.280 --> 22:19.280
- First person.
- First person, OK.

22:19.560 --> 22:23.040
He's writing about himself. I mean, he can
come up with something else, but...

22:23.640 --> 22:27.800
I sure think this one is him
trying to figure what's wrong with him.

22:28.960 --> 22:31.480
There's so many things in here
that correspond with

22:31.560 --> 22:33.280
what I believe I know about-- Look.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.880
I can't believe anything my brother-in-law
tell us anymore,

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
but what I thought I knew about his life,
about him getting married,

22:39.240 --> 22:41.240
going off to Vietnam
and certain other things,

22:41.640 --> 22:43.320
and that this one thing
at the back...

22:43.400 --> 22:46.840
Whoa. I want it to be that
he talks about himself.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.560
This handwritten thing,

22:49.120 --> 22:50.400
he talks about...

22:51.640 --> 22:56.000
that he's an aberrant personality, pure
wicked, and incapable of moral action.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.600
Well, I spent a lot of time reading
his handwriting. I'm getting to know it.

22:59.680 --> 23:02.640
And so I thought, "Wow!
He know's something's wrong with him,

23:03.240 --> 23:05.000
and he's trying to figure it out."

23:06.240 --> 23:09.880
And unfortunately took it out on my sister
and some other people, but...

23:12.400 --> 23:15.400
And the DA can't bring it in
unless Michael gets on the stand, but...

23:16.440 --> 23:17.920
there's not much else I can do.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.640
I couldn't find anywhere where he
talked about how he planned to...

23:21.600 --> 23:25.320
seduce women and push them down
the stairs and collect their money.

23:26.320 --> 23:28.120
I was like... I couldn't find that.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.840
- Alright.
- I was hoping to.

23:29.920 --> 23:33.520
OK, that's the one where he talks about
happiness is murdering.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.040
OK, so this is...

23:36.520 --> 23:38.960
I don't think it's worth copying all this
for Lori,

23:39.240 --> 23:43.200
but it's a short story
set in Germany, and...

23:44.840 --> 23:45.720
Here we go.

23:47.480 --> 23:50.840
"Hell is not being happy,
and being happy is what?

23:51.120 --> 23:52.680
Being happy is doing what you want.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.720
Doing you want want
is an exercise in pleasure.

23:56.080 --> 23:58.560
Therefore, being happy
is doing what gives you pleasure.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.800
Loving, sacrificing, murdering."

24:02.920 --> 24:04.360
I could see the loving part.

24:05.680 --> 24:08.280
- Possibly even sacrificing.
- Make two copies of that.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.320
Two copies?

24:10.520 --> 24:11.520
I'll make three.

24:17.600 --> 24:21.880
Could you tell the jury
what biomechanics is?

24:22.360 --> 24:27.320
Well, the word in biomechanics,
"mechanics" is the study

24:27.440 --> 24:30.880
of forces and motions on objects.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.520
How... how objects deform,

24:33.600 --> 24:36.200
how they tear, how they break,
how they rupture.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.560
When you focus it as biomechanics,

24:39.640 --> 24:41.800
it ends up being that same application

24:41.880 --> 24:45.120
to understand the deformations
and the forces on the human body.

24:45.840 --> 24:48.800
Have you supervised the creation

24:49.320 --> 24:52.720
of an exhibit? Could you describe
to the members of the jury

24:53.240 --> 24:58.000
what it was and how it was created,
in terms of what mathematics,

24:58.080 --> 25:01.120
what figures, what science went into it?

25:01.560 --> 25:06.400
Basically we had to reconstruct,
graphically, the dimensions of the scene.

25:06.480 --> 25:11.880
And we had to, from pictures
of Mrs. Peterson standing up, et cetera,

25:11.960 --> 25:17.560
to approximate her height and shape,
and we had to use all that information

25:17.640 --> 25:21.680
to see if a scenario of a fall
is possible.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.920
And, in fact, if it's realistic.

25:24.880 --> 25:27.280
And, in fact, if it's likely.

25:27.960 --> 25:31.600
You know, this is an action
that could happen any different way,

25:31.680 --> 25:34.400
but basically she lost her balance
and fell straight back.

25:34.480 --> 25:37.320
Nothing to restrain herself
when she let go of the railing.

25:39.520 --> 25:42.600
And how far did her head travel,

25:42.680 --> 25:46.200
did the simulation head travel
before it hit that...

25:47.160 --> 25:48.000
moulding?

25:48.080 --> 25:52.680
For this one, it's about 35 inches of arc.

25:53.120 --> 25:56.800
And that's how you're figuring out
the load this created that sufficient

25:57.120 --> 26:00.800
to cause the laceration,
but not sufficient to cause a fracture?

26:00.880 --> 26:02.040
- Right.
- OK.

26:03.200 --> 26:06.440
- that door jamb, its shape, and...

26:07.240 --> 26:11.960
how high she fell from that step
could have accounted for this injury.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.720
The left arm has a contact.

26:22.920 --> 26:25.360
Right arm has a contact against
the moulding.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.360
Is there a bruise in that location?

26:27.440 --> 26:30.120
Yeah, these are the consistent
elbow bruises.

26:31.680 --> 26:33.840
Continuing with the contact points,

26:34.000 --> 26:37.120
the back of her head above the neck
contacts that step.

26:38.840 --> 26:41.360
You saw the first one
from that first contact.

26:41.600 --> 26:45.040
And this second one,
resting on that step is

26:45.400 --> 26:47.680
responsible for these two.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.760
From a sitting position, getting up,
you see where her feet are.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.880
She slips out, loses her balanced there.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.600
If she were taller,
if she were six foot five,

27:04.320 --> 27:07.400
she'd probably hit the east wall
or something. I mean, you know, it's...

27:07.480 --> 27:10.600
This is a dimensional issue.
So, falling from that point

27:11.080 --> 27:14.880
allows her to hit where she hits,
because that's her characteristic length.

27:18.200 --> 27:21.080
How many autopsies
have you attended where

27:21.360 --> 27:27.000
the ultimate opinion of the pathologist
was that an adult person died

27:27.360 --> 27:31.080
- as a result of a beating death?
- No, I didn't do that. None.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.480
But not having had that experience

27:33.560 --> 27:36.200
and not being
a forensic pathologist yourself,

27:37.080 --> 27:39.920
you've come into this courtroom
and told this jury that Deborah Radisch,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.680
who actually performed the autopsy,
is just dead wrong about this?

27:42.800 --> 27:44.880
What I'm saying is it's more likely

27:45.360 --> 27:48.200
that a fall impact

27:48.920 --> 27:51.440
caused this, and we have
biomechanical evidence that

27:51.560 --> 27:53.200
an impact with a hollow cylinder

27:54.000 --> 27:55.640
wouldn't... wouldn't do it.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.960
She is wrong, if that's what she's saying.

27:58.320 --> 28:01.840
Would you agree that a person
that's actually there

28:02.120 --> 28:06.120
performing the work on a body,
whether it be surgical work

28:06.520 --> 28:09.840
or work as a forensic pathologist,
would you not agree

28:09.920 --> 28:13.840
that that person who can actually
look at the body, feel the organs,

28:14.080 --> 28:16.920
feel the wounds,
might have a better vantage point

28:17.000 --> 28:20.720
in making a final decision about a case
than a person later on

28:20.960 --> 28:22.240
doing like what you did?

28:22.560 --> 28:26.080
I don't know how she could determine
how those injuries occurred.

28:27.600 --> 28:31.960
If she determined that those injuries
were the cause of death,

28:32.040 --> 28:35.280
that's fine, but the causation,
the mechanism by which

28:35.360 --> 28:38.400
these things occurred,
whether they are cut with a knife,

28:38.480 --> 28:42.080
or a cylinder,
or a flat object, or a fall,

28:42.160 --> 28:44.520
I would be surprised if Dr. Radisch

28:44.760 --> 28:49.240
would be able to do that. If I know
medical training, they don't have

28:49.320 --> 28:51.440
causation training by mechanics.

28:51.520 --> 28:55.920
My question was whether you would agree
that a person that's actually there,

28:56.040 --> 29:00.600
whether it be a doctor, or a pathologist,
or even someone in your position,

29:00.880 --> 29:05.840
actually there visualizing
a person's body, looking at their wounds,

29:06.040 --> 29:09.200
feeling their wounds,
measuring their wounds,

29:09.480 --> 29:11.520
looking at all the different things
on the body,

29:11.600 --> 29:14.200
would you not agree that a person
with that vantage point

29:14.360 --> 29:17.760
would really have an advantage
in making a decision in a case like this?

29:17.840 --> 29:19.320
Making a decision...

29:19.560 --> 29:21.800
The person right there
with their hands right there.

29:22.040 --> 29:24.400
- Not on the causation...
- With their eyes right there.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.360
the event that caused the injuries.

29:26.440 --> 29:30.280
I don't believe just by being there
you have sufficient

29:30.440 --> 29:34.680
insight, knowledge, to determine
how those injuries were caused.

29:35.040 --> 29:35.880
OK.

29:40.520 --> 29:42.840
Somebody, it was probably
on Court TV, said,

29:42.920 --> 29:47.480
"The defense, they haven't injected
a single bit of emotion in this case.

29:47.760 --> 29:51.480
It's been science, science, science,
but in fact this is two dead women."

29:52.480 --> 29:53.680
That is a problem.

29:54.120 --> 29:59.240
From... just from the point of view
I'm talking about, which is the story.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.000
That's what I do for a living,
is tell stories.

30:02.360 --> 30:06.000
And everybody wants to hear a story,
from the time they were little babies.

30:06.080 --> 30:07.840
This is the story.

30:08.200 --> 30:11.800
And better a nice story
than a scary story.

30:11.880 --> 30:14.640
And I do see
where we haven't told a story.

30:14.960 --> 30:18.680
Except in the sense that,
here are the forensics

30:18.920 --> 30:21.400
and that's cold, and whatnot.

30:21.480 --> 30:26.800
But I don't know how you get
into the story, anybody's story,

30:27.160 --> 30:31.200
without going into the other side,
the bad stuff

30:31.360 --> 30:34.160
that everybody doesn't particularly want
to have come out in their life,

30:34.240 --> 30:35.760
because for every good thing,

30:35.920 --> 30:38.720
there's... if there's not at least
a bad thing, somewhere back there

30:38.800 --> 30:41.720
there's a spin on it that can come back,
I don't know.

30:42.320 --> 30:44.280
- I don't know.
- It's a razor's edge.

30:44.360 --> 30:50.040
I think the prosecution has used
every dirty trick they can to do

30:50.320 --> 30:52.360
character assassination of Mike.

30:53.120 --> 30:57.520
And they've-- they've taken
every little point that could possibly

30:57.640 --> 31:02.280
been made and twisted it
in a light most unfavorable.

31:02.960 --> 31:06.560
You know, there has been a lot
of emotional testimony there,

31:07.000 --> 31:10.640
and that it... when there gets to be
debates in the jury room

31:10.960 --> 31:13.880
between... on the science,

31:14.520 --> 31:18.000
if you've got swing people,
what do they fall back on?

31:18.120 --> 31:21.440
A lot of those people
could fall back on emotion.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.680
What can we do about that?

31:24.040 --> 31:26.200
They have no neighbors,

31:26.760 --> 31:30.760
nobody here within the community,
you're well-known, Kathleen's well-known,

31:31.000 --> 31:33.440
nobody really from Nortel.

31:33.880 --> 31:37.160
Caitlin, who they've had access to,
has been in court every day.

31:37.240 --> 31:40.280
If it would've been anything negative
that any of these people could offer,

31:40.360 --> 31:43.480
they would've brought them in.
To me, that is strong.

31:43.800 --> 31:45.600
The fact fact that they've had
Caitlin there,

31:45.680 --> 31:47.560
and if there's anything
within the relationship,

31:47.640 --> 31:48.840
they would've brought her in.

31:48.920 --> 31:51.720
May I interject?
Now is this something you can use?

31:51.800 --> 31:53.480
That you could turn to and say,
"Look..."

31:53.560 --> 31:54.480
- Yes.
- OK, alright.

31:55.120 --> 32:00.040
So, the lack of what they put out,
to me, is stronger than anything else.

32:00.240 --> 32:03.400
And I think that if we open up
the door

32:03.720 --> 32:06.680
to anything with your character,
your ass is gone.

32:06.840 --> 32:10.200
If the forensics were doing poorly,
and we thought, "God,

32:10.280 --> 32:12.520
you know, we really need to
give something to the people,"

32:12.600 --> 32:14.640
than maybe you'd take a risk,
but I think

32:14.960 --> 32:18.200
that the forensics, it's gone about
as well as it can go,

32:18.440 --> 32:21.960
you know, other than somebody magically
saying, "Seven lacerations disappear."

32:22.160 --> 32:23.160
Mm-hm.

32:23.600 --> 32:28.760
Is there anybody who is in favor
of calling any other witness,

32:28.840 --> 32:30.240
including you, Michael?

32:30.840 --> 32:32.280
Most importantly you.

32:32.520 --> 32:34.160
No, because I am very realistic.

32:35.600 --> 32:38.480
Nobody's insulting me.
I am a big boy and...

32:38.800 --> 32:41.560
Hell, I have lived my life.
So, yes, I understand.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.440
And...

32:44.440 --> 32:46.120
it would be

32:46.720 --> 32:49.680
probably infinitely more negative

32:50.520 --> 32:52.400
in the long run, so..

32:53.440 --> 32:54.280
drop it.

32:54.840 --> 32:55.680
- OK.
- OK.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.440
Meeting adjourned.

33:06.520 --> 33:08.080
OK.

33:23.840 --> 33:24.840
Go in there.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.400
Go through the house.
They wanna look at the pool.

33:29.880 --> 33:31.800
- Does that suit you, Dave?
- Just tell Martin.

33:31.920 --> 33:34.120
They can go in this way,
do whatever they're gonna do,

33:34.200 --> 33:36.000
see the pool, and come exit this way.

33:53.960 --> 33:54.800
Well...

34:00.520 --> 34:04.480
Now, we put... What we did was
we put the... made sure the chair

34:05.040 --> 34:06.640
was along that line there.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.960
- 'Cause it was in the down position.
- Well, yeah.

34:09.040 --> 34:10.600
And we tried to match it so that...

34:10.679 --> 34:13.199
Remember, Deaver said
it would match that.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.159
Right.

34:16.520 --> 34:17.360
OK.

34:19.280 --> 34:20.960
- Let me go this way.
- Alright.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.159
I know what to do,
I'm going to look at it upstairs.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.920
- levity.
-

34:58.240 --> 35:01.160
- Put out all the family photos.
- That's right, absolutely.

35:01.280 --> 35:03.880
- Put away all the porn, right?
- That's right.

35:03.960 --> 35:08.400
- Just trying to be...
- No, I'm only teasing. I'm only teasing.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.280
You did see the blow poke
over there, right?

35:14.360 --> 35:15.480
Oh, I missed it.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.560
I think I've seen enough.

35:55.600 --> 35:57.120
We'll come back out this way.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
A lot of them paid attention
to the blood spatter,

36:15.720 --> 36:18.680
even kneeling down,
looking down, squatting,

36:18.760 --> 36:21.840
looking at the dried blood
that was on the moulding of the doorway.

36:22.040 --> 36:24.080
So, they were really interested in
the blood spatter.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.040
Did the jurors touch anything?

36:26.120 --> 36:27.600
Well, they all took notes.

36:27.680 --> 36:30.840
They would come out of the stairwell
and take notes and go back in,

36:30.920 --> 36:32.560
get another look, then take more...

36:32.640 --> 36:36.080
Did it seem like they wanted a spatial
sense of whether there is room to...

36:36.320 --> 36:37.720
- get the blow poke?
- Well...

36:37.880 --> 36:41.280
Like I said earlier, several of them
stood in the stairwell,

36:41.360 --> 36:44.400
went up about three or four steps,
and kind of waved their arms

36:44.480 --> 36:46.680
to kind of get a sense
if you can fall back.

36:46.760 --> 36:50.280
They seemed to be consuming a lot.
It's one thing to see it in a picture,

36:50.360 --> 36:53.040
I guess it's another thing to see it
in person.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.880
- How'd the blood look?
- It was dry.

37:04.720 --> 37:05.840
Ron?

37:06.520 --> 37:07.880
What are you doing today?

37:10.080 --> 37:11.880
I need you to come to Chapel Hill.

37:15.040 --> 37:18.480
They found the blow poke.

37:20.320 --> 37:23.880
No, the blow poke.
They found the blow poke.

37:30.840 --> 37:31.680
Hi, Ron.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.120
You fucked up a good golf game.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.640
Well, sorry.

37:37.120 --> 37:39.000
You could've gone to play golf,
I didn't...

37:39.240 --> 37:41.400
I had my golf bag on my shoulder,
walking out the door.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.280
- Did you really?
- And then I saw Rudolf Myers.

37:44.360 --> 37:48.360
Shouldn't have picked it up.
Shouldn't have picked it up, but I did.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.400
Alright.

37:54.120 --> 37:57.480
Let's start with me
understanding completely

37:58.640 --> 38:00.840
what happened. Alright? So...

38:01.560 --> 38:04.120
take it from the top, Clayton.
I mean, give me...

38:04.640 --> 38:05.680
give me the full rundown.

38:06.120 --> 38:08.640
Well, I went downstairs. First thing
I did, I looked at the car.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.080
I looked in the trunk.

38:11.520 --> 38:14.600
And I looked around at the side
'cause that's where the tools are.

38:14.680 --> 38:16.480
- OK.
- And...

38:16.800 --> 38:18.800
then I came around
to the other side and...

38:19.600 --> 38:23.200
I just saw it there. It was just right
past the trunk, just sitting there.

38:23.480 --> 38:24.320
OK.

38:24.520 --> 38:28.200
So, then I went and got Margaret
and brought her down,

38:28.480 --> 38:31.920
just to make sure, 'cause I couldn't
believe it was just sitting right there.

38:32.320 --> 38:33.720
Then we went upstairs and got Dad.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.760
- What was he doing?
- I was reading.

38:36.320 --> 38:37.480
Almost going to sleep.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.400
And, Margaret, you went to get him?

38:39.480 --> 38:41.640
Yeah, I just yelled,
"Dad, we found the blow poke."

38:43.200 --> 38:44.760
Come on, let's go!

38:45.160 --> 38:48.040
We were terrified.
We were freaked that, you know...

38:48.600 --> 38:49.680
Literally freaked

38:50.000 --> 38:53.080
as to what happened. So, we got...
Margaret got her video camera out.

38:53.160 --> 38:57.680
I got the... She got the tape recorder.
We were... I called Tom by this time.

38:58.040 --> 39:01.560
And, you know, if the cops show up,
we're just going to...

39:01.760 --> 39:04.160
"You can't come into this house
until my attorney, who is..."

39:04.240 --> 39:06.320
I thought you were going to
show up on a motorcycle.

39:06.520 --> 39:07.840
"...appears."

39:08.480 --> 39:12.720
So, now you're waiting on Tom. What are
you doing while you're waiting on Tom?

39:12.800 --> 39:14.800
- We went in the den.
- OK.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.960
And Todd said, "I wanna talk to you, Dad.

39:17.040 --> 39:21.040
And I'm going to ask you. Would you
bet your life on that blow poke?"

39:21.120 --> 39:23.760
And I know exactly what
he was doing and what he was saying.

39:23.840 --> 39:26.760
That, "Dad, I know, you know,
if there's any chance

39:27.200 --> 39:30.360
there's blood, or hair, or anything
on that blow poke,

39:30.760 --> 39:33.160
I'll take that goddamned thing
and send it in Jordan Lake."

39:33.280 --> 39:36.720
He didn't say that, but I knew
that's what he was getting at.

39:37.080 --> 39:41.040
So I said, you know,
"No! Absolutely...

39:41.920 --> 39:45.000
I would bet my life on that blow poke,
unless the cops..."

39:45.080 --> 39:47.200
'cause we're still going through
this conspiracy thing,

39:47.280 --> 39:49.960
"Unless the cops came, got blood
and put hair on the goddamned thing."

39:50.720 --> 39:51.640
So, then...

39:52.560 --> 39:54.400
Then our next concern was Clayton.

39:55.200 --> 39:56.720
He did this. He put it there.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.280
You know, and we talked to him,
and we talked to him.

39:59.720 --> 40:03.760
I said, "Look, you got to
tell us the truth. Is this...

40:04.360 --> 40:05.440
Is this legit?

40:05.640 --> 40:08.360
I have looked down there.
I have been down there.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.080
I... Clyde has been down there.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.600
We look specifically
for the goddamned thing.

40:12.800 --> 40:16.920
I cannot believe I missed it."
And he swore to me,"Dad...

40:17.040 --> 40:19.960
I went in and found it. That's it."

40:31.840 --> 40:33.000
Just be careful.

40:34.880 --> 40:36.920
But how the fuck
does that get missed?

40:37.800 --> 40:39.080
How did they miss that, Ron?

40:39.520 --> 40:41.320
Looks like a shower curtain.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.640
- It's a pattern.
- No, how did Mike...

40:45.200 --> 40:47.200
I don't think they looked that well.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.240
I mean, there's a lot of shit.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.440
- No, no. Ron, Ron.
- I know.

40:51.520 --> 40:55.200
You walk down and it's fucking here.
I mean, it's not like it's in a corner.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.400
Yeah, well.

40:57.600 --> 40:59.520
On the edge, it looks like tiny little...

41:01.720 --> 41:03.160
- I don't know.
- There is some stuff.

41:03.240 --> 41:05.480
But what difference does it make?
This is clearly old...

41:05.560 --> 41:10.000
I mean, it's not something Mike bought
in the last six months.

41:13.120 --> 41:16.800
- It's 38 and... It's 38, it's 38.
- Maybe it--

41:19.720 --> 41:21.560
You need to go have a talk
with Mike.

41:21.640 --> 41:24.000
I need to make sure that if we test
this fucking thing...

41:25.960 --> 41:27.360
He swears, right?

41:27.520 --> 41:28.680
Let's go talk.

41:36.120 --> 41:38.400
You see, I don't believe

41:39.120 --> 41:41.320
that it was there all this time.

41:42.240 --> 41:45.280
That goddamned thing has not been there
for five years.

41:46.080 --> 41:48.640
Or six years, or seven years.
I don't believe that.

41:49.560 --> 41:50.440
I really don't.

41:50.880 --> 41:52.440
I agree with you on that.

41:56.640 --> 41:58.040
It seems to me...

41:59.080 --> 42:00.360
that...

42:02.560 --> 42:07.240
from a strategic point of view,
I don't have any idea

42:08.240 --> 42:13.040
how this ends up cutting. I don't think
it hurts us unless the jury feels

42:13.280 --> 42:15.280
like we have staged this in some way.

42:15.360 --> 42:16.920
Yes! Yes! Yes!

42:17.040 --> 42:20.520
I understand that, Mike, but...
And I think the way

42:21.120 --> 42:22.680
- we...
- It's too preposterous!

42:22.800 --> 42:26.440
OK, it may be too preposterous,
but it is what it is,

42:27.040 --> 42:30.280
And so it seems to me that what we
need to do is

42:30.600 --> 42:33.720
figure out the best way of

42:33.920 --> 42:39.280
revealing this so as to minimize any
chance that the jury is going to feel

42:39.720 --> 42:42.200
like we have staged this
in some way.

42:42.280 --> 42:43.880
I wouldn't buy it in a minute!

42:45.360 --> 42:47.200
- My God!
- Well...

42:49.040 --> 42:52.240
- I don't know what else to do.
- I know. No, I understand that.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.320
I do, I just cannot...

42:59.040 --> 43:00.400
I think this is terrible.

43:03.000 --> 43:03.840
Well,

43:03.920 --> 43:07.480
can we get a professional photographer
over so that we can actually get

43:08.120 --> 43:12.560
close-ups of the little bugs,
and really good pictures of the...

43:13.040 --> 43:16.760
of the cobwebs and all that stuff.
I mean, you know...

43:17.040 --> 43:19.960
studio-quality pictures,
whatever that takes.

43:23.840 --> 43:26.680
I do not see how this can be turned
into anything good.

43:42.560 --> 43:45.400
Now look on here, how many
cobwebs you have in this.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.960
You have to hit it just right
with the light.

43:48.520 --> 43:52.200
See right there, that group right there?
See another group right there?

44:05.320 --> 44:06.160
Shit.

44:14.920 --> 44:17.600
That's on there in front...
was on the side here.

44:18.440 --> 44:20.560
So you gotta be careful
when you do this here.

44:22.320 --> 44:23.560
You know, there's...

44:24.520 --> 44:26.480
all kinds of filaments attached.

44:33.480 --> 44:34.680
Cut it off right there.

44:40.280 --> 44:42.400
I got to get your fingerprints
on this somehow.

44:46.680 --> 44:49.120
Somebody's squeezing it too tight
there in middle.

44:49.440 --> 44:50.360
It's not going in.

44:51.640 --> 44:54.080
Right here, Todd.
You need to be careful about this here.

44:54.160 --> 44:55.080
OK.

44:58.720 --> 45:00.600
- I'm gonna let go for a minute, hold on.
- OK.

45:07.320 --> 45:09.760
- Let me... Let me grab it.
- OK.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.560
You move your hands.

45:17.400 --> 45:20.000
Careful it doesn't go through all the way.

45:20.560 --> 45:21.720
Yeah, got it.

45:22.160 --> 45:23.000
Fuck!

45:25.440 --> 45:27.600
I don't know, I gotta get get upstairs
and see it better.

45:29.760 --> 45:30.600
That's good.

45:32.120 --> 45:32.960
That's good.

45:34.320 --> 45:36.920
Goddamn! This looks like something
out of Star Wars.

45:37.320 --> 45:40.080
Don't you think?
This looks like, you know...

45:40.360 --> 45:41.560
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

45:42.400 --> 45:44.160
- Here, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
-

45:44.240 --> 45:45.600
Stop fucking with it.

45:46.840 --> 45:47.920
Don't you think, Obi?

45:48.000 --> 45:50.320
You can't bounce it around
'cause the shit's already on it.

45:50.400 --> 45:52.520
- Alright, alright.
- We were careful, so, stop.

45:53.360 --> 45:54.920
So what's the plan?

45:55.520 --> 45:57.320
We're going to plead you,
tomorrow.

45:58.320 --> 46:00.680
Hey, I'm ready. I don't care.

46:01.240 --> 46:03.560
- It's this shit I can't handle.
- Right.

46:04.440 --> 46:05.680
Send me away.

46:06.160 --> 46:09.400
Fuck, I'd take... I'd take
a lethal injection about this point.

46:10.360 --> 46:11.480
I think...

46:12.080 --> 46:13.080
um...

46:13.440 --> 46:14.680
we need to call Clayton.

46:14.920 --> 46:16.160
- You do?
- Yep.

46:16.560 --> 46:19.120
Please, rethink that.
Why do you need Clayton?

46:19.520 --> 46:23.560
Because I think we need to establish...
Let's put it this way.

46:24.840 --> 46:28.800
Suppose we had... Suppose Clayton
had found that three months ago.

46:29.080 --> 46:31.200
- Right
- Alright, during jury selection.

46:32.120 --> 46:34.600
Would there be any doubt in your mind,

46:35.240 --> 46:37.960
as we sat there and listened to Hardin

46:38.080 --> 46:41.120
talk about the blow poke,
and how they got rid of the blow poke,

46:41.200 --> 46:42.960
and the blow poke's the murder weapon,

46:43.120 --> 46:46.400
and Deborah Radisch says, "Oh, yeah,
this is it, because it's hard enough,

46:46.480 --> 46:49.200
but it's not too hard."
Would there be any doubt in your mind

46:49.280 --> 46:51.280
that we'd want to put that blow poke
into evidence?

46:54.120 --> 46:56.600
- No, I guess not.
- No. The only thing...

46:56.680 --> 46:59.120
The only fly in the ointment

46:59.440 --> 47:01.800
is that we found it last night,

47:02.120 --> 47:04.720
not three months ago, right?
I mean, that...

47:05.720 --> 47:09.080
I mean, let's all get clear on that.
Isn't that really the issue?

47:09.160 --> 47:11.560
If we had found this...
if you had found it six months ago,

47:11.640 --> 47:14.320
would you have any doubt in your mind
about whether we should use it?

47:14.440 --> 47:15.400
Of course not, no.

47:15.480 --> 47:16.320
No.

47:16.640 --> 47:18.800
You wouldn't either.
We'd be there salivating.

47:18.880 --> 47:22.560
We'd be waiting for that
magic moment when I took it out.

47:23.080 --> 47:26.240
Is there no way to fudge it
and say,

47:26.520 --> 47:29.400
"Here it is in the house.
It was found in the house.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.920
It's been in the house for
who knows how long."

47:32.840 --> 47:34.640
You can't fudge this, Mike.

47:35.280 --> 47:37.520
I don't want Clayton
on the stand.

47:37.800 --> 47:41.280
That's all. They're just gonna kill him.
You know that and I know that.

47:41.760 --> 47:45.000
- Freda Black is, you know...
- What are they going to do?

47:45.760 --> 47:48.520
They're going to establish that when he
was a freshman in college

47:49.040 --> 47:50.200
he got in trouble?

47:52.400 --> 47:55.520
They're going to cross-examine him
about his credit card debt.

47:56.720 --> 47:58.240
- Yeah.
- Yeah, OK.

47:58.400 --> 48:01.600
He's got a pending driving without--
a revoked license.

48:02.840 --> 48:04.800
That's still pending in court here.

48:05.360 --> 48:07.080
He had a DWI two years ago.

48:08.520 --> 48:12.160
Alright, I'm going.
I've seen enough of you for today.

48:12.520 --> 48:13.560
Be cool!

48:16.320 --> 48:19.000
Bye, Mike!
Thanks for a great Sunday.

48:21.120 --> 48:24.840
Hey, listen, if anything else comes up
that's really an emergency,

48:24.920 --> 48:27.480
- Call Hardin.
- That's right, don't call me.

48:31.720 --> 48:33.880
And I don't answer the phone at 2:30.

48:34.320 --> 48:35.520
I noticed.

48:36.080 --> 48:36.920
Never!
