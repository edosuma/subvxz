WEBVTT

00:07.750 --> 00:12.333
NOTHING.
NOTHING. AH.

00:12.333 --> 00:14.083
YOU?

00:14.083 --> 00:15.125
NOTHING.

00:15.125 --> 00:16.792
[GROANS]

00:16.792 --> 00:18.000
GOD, PACEY,
THIS IS WEIRD.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
IT REALLY IS. IT'S
THE DAMNDEST THING.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
I MEAN, HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED

00:21.000 --> 00:23.667
TO HAVE SOME LURID,
PURELY SEXUAL AFFAIR

00:23.667 --> 00:24.792
IF EVERY TIME
WE GET TOGETHER--

00:24.792 --> 00:25.667
THERE'S NO SEXUAL
TENSION.
NADA.

00:25.667 --> 00:27.834
ZILCH.
[SIGHS]

00:27.834 --> 00:29.041
IS IT ME?
IF IT'S ME--

00:29.041 --> 00:32.040
Both: NO, IT'S NOT YOU,
IT'S ME.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.458
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:34.458 --> 00:36.583
NO, NO, I MEAN,
WE'RE BOTH,

00:36.583 --> 00:38.708
WE'RE BOTH 2 HIGHLY
SEXUALLY CHARGED PEOPLE.

00:38.708 --> 00:40.375
ABSOLUTELY. LOOK AT
OUR TRACK RECORDS.
OH, YEAH.

00:40.375 --> 00:41.417
WE'RE ALL THAT
AND THEN SOME,

00:41.417 --> 00:42.708
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

00:42.708 --> 00:45.000
AND LOOK AT THE MEASURES THAT
WE'VE GONE THROUGH TODAY.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.166
WE'VE COME
PROPERLY EQUIPPED.

00:46.166 --> 00:49.458
AND WE'VE PICKED
THE PERFECT LOCALE.

00:49.458 --> 00:50.750
ABSOLUTELY,
YOU KNOW,

00:50.750 --> 00:52.166
DAWSON
AND MR.LEERY

00:52.166 --> 00:53.542
BOTH AT SCHOOL
FOR THE AFTERNOON,

00:53.542 --> 00:54.667
THE WINDOW'S
ALWAYS OPEN,

00:54.667 --> 00:57.583
THIS WAS
SHEER GENIUS
ON YOUR PART.

00:57.583 --> 00:58.875
GRAMS ALWAYS SAID
THAT THAT LADDER

00:58.875 --> 01:00.291
WAS AN INVITATION
TO SIN.

01:09.375 --> 01:11.875
[BOTH SIGH]

01:11.875 --> 01:13.250
IT'S REALLY STARTING
TO GET DEPRESSING.

01:13.250 --> 01:16.000
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.166
WHY DON'T WE
GIVE IT A WEEK?
KEEP TRYING

01:17.166 --> 01:20.417
IN THE HOPES THAT
WHATEVER SEXUAL SPARK

01:20.417 --> 01:22.250
THAT ONCE FLICKERED
WILL BURN AGAIN.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.500
[GRUNTS]

01:30.083 --> 01:32.417
WHOA, WHOA.
DID YOU JUST HEAR

01:32.417 --> 01:34.291
SOMEBODY
COME INTO THE HOUSE?

01:37.250 --> 01:39.041
WHOA, MAN.

01:42.917 --> 01:44.291
PACEY?

01:44.291 --> 01:48.208
HEY, MAN.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

01:48.208 --> 01:51.375
W--WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY ROOM

01:51.375 --> 01:52.959
IN THE MIDDLE OF
A SCHOOL DAY?

01:52.959 --> 01:54.959
JUST PLAYING SOME
CRASH BANDICOOT.

01:54.959 --> 01:56.250
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HOME?

01:56.250 --> 01:57.875
I HAD A DENTIST
APPOINTMENT.

01:57.875 --> 01:59.959
CAME BACK
TO GET MY BOOKS.

01:59.959 --> 02:02.083
YOU, UH,
HAVE ANY CAVITIES?

02:02.083 --> 02:05.375
NO. HOW, HOW DID YOU
GET IN?

02:05.375 --> 02:07.125
IS THAT CLOCK RIGHT,
ON THE VCR?

02:07.125 --> 02:08.208
'CAUSE IF IT IS,
MAN,

02:08.208 --> 02:09.166
I SHOULD REALLY BE
GETTING TO SCHOOL.

02:09.166 --> 02:11.708
AREN'T YOU FORGETTING
SOMETHING?

02:11.708 --> 02:14.041
I DON'T THINK SO.

02:14.041 --> 02:15.000
YOU SURE?

02:15.000 --> 02:15.959
PRETTY SURE, YEAH.

02:15.959 --> 02:17.333
'CAUSE YOU'RE
ONLY WEARING ONE SHOE.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.667
HEY.
OH, MY GOD,

03:17.667 --> 03:18.708
I HOPE THAT IS NOT
YOUR REPORT

03:18.708 --> 03:20.375
ON MANIFEST DESTINY
BECAUSE MINE

03:20.375 --> 03:21.333
IS ONLY
4 PARAGRAPHS.

03:21.333 --> 03:22.375
NO, NO. REMEMBER
WHEN DAWSON

03:22.375 --> 03:23.417
PUT THAT STORY
ABOUT ME

03:23.417 --> 03:24.792
JOINING THE
FOOTBALL TEAM
ON THE WEB?

03:24.792 --> 03:26.000
YEAH?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.500
WELL THESE
ARE E-MAILS FROM
PEOPLE WHO SAW IT.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.667
OH, JACK.
THIS IS AMAZING.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.625
I MEAN, LOOK HOW MANY
PEOPLE YOU REACHED.

03:33.625 --> 03:35.917
OH, LOOK,
I DIDN'T EXACTLY
REACH EVERYBODY.

03:35.917 --> 03:38.834
CHECK THIS OUT.

03:38.834 --> 03:41.542
"DEAR HOMO,

03:41.542 --> 03:43.834
"TOO BAD CAPESIDE
DIDN'T MAKE IT
TO REGIONALS.

"OUR LINEBACKERS
ARE LOOKING FORWARD

03:44.625 --> 03:46.500
TO PLAYING
SMEAR THE QUEER."

03:46.500 --> 03:48.333
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S SO SAD.

03:48.333 --> 03:50.375
I MEAN, SOME POOR,
DUMB CHEERLEADER

03:50.375 --> 03:52.792
IS WASTING ALL OF
HER PRIME BOY-CHASING YEARS

03:52.792 --> 03:54.375
ON THIS CLOSET CASE.

03:54.375 --> 03:58.959
OK, THIS ONE LOOKS GOOD.
"DEAR JACK,

03:58.959 --> 04:00.625
"SAW THE STORY
ABOUT YOU ON THE WEB.

"THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED

"WHEN I TOOK ANOTHER GUY

WHO'S THAT FROM?

04:15.166 --> 04:19.083
UH, SOME GUY NAMED BEN.

GIVE ME THAT.
GOTCHA.

04:29.375 --> 04:30.291
YOU SHOULD
WRITE HIM BACK.

04:30.291 --> 04:32.041
HE SOUNDS LIKE
A NICE GUY.

04:32.041 --> 04:33.041
YEAH, I THINK
I'M GONNA

04:33.041 --> 04:34.083
WRITE THIS GUY
BACK, MAN.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.125
HE'S A TOTAL
STRANGER.

04:35.125 --> 04:36.250
WHAT WOULD I SAY?

04:36.250 --> 04:38.166
I DON'T KNOW.
SAY ANYTHING.

04:38.166 --> 04:39.583
IT WORKED
FOR JOHN CUSACK.

04:39.583 --> 04:43.375
OK, GOTTA GO. BYE.

04:46.625 --> 04:48.708
ALL RIGHT,
WHATEVER IT IS,
I DIDN'T DO IT,

04:48.708 --> 04:51.417
BUT IF I DID DO IT,
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

04:51.417 --> 04:52.959
THAT I TAKE FULL AND
COMPLETE RESPONSIBILITY

04:52.959 --> 04:54.125
FOR ALL OF MY ACTIONS.

04:54.125 --> 04:58.250
THIS ISN'T A
DISCIPLINARY MATTER
PACEY. PLEASE.

04:58.250 --> 05:00.458
YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE
WHEN MR. MILO

05:00.458 --> 05:01.458
SENT YOUR FILE
OVER TO ME,

05:01.458 --> 05:04.834
YOU JUMPED
IMMEDIATELY
TO THE TOP 10

05:04.834 --> 05:07.417
OF MY "MOST IN NEED
OF GUIDANCE" LIST.

05:07.417 --> 05:10.959
AND WHEN I STARTED
TALKING TO YOUR TEACHERS...

05:10.959 --> 05:12.417
UH-OH.

05:12.417 --> 05:15.250
YOU'RE FAILING MATH,
PACEY.

05:15.250 --> 05:16.375
I'M FAILING?

05:16.375 --> 05:17.792
I'M AFRAID
THE ONLY OTHER GRADES

05:17.792 --> 05:20.125
YOU'VE GOT GOING HERE
ARE 4 D-PLUSES,

05:20.125 --> 05:22.458
AND ONE VERY LONELY
C-MINUS.

05:25.583 --> 05:27.917
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHY THAT IS?

05:27.917 --> 05:32.125
JUST LAZY, I GUESS.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.458
HAS THERE BEEN
SOME TROUBLE AT HOME,

05:33.458 --> 05:35.542
ANY, ANY SORT OF CHANGE
IN YOUR FAMILY SITUATION?

05:35.542 --> 05:37.291
NOPE, IT'S NOTHING
LIKE THAT.

05:37.291 --> 05:39.333
MR. MILO MENTIONED
SOMETHING

05:39.333 --> 05:41.333
ABOUT A GIRLFRIEND
BEING SICK.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.667
SHE'S NOT MY
GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE.

05:43.667 --> 05:44.375
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

05:44.375 --> 05:46.166
YEAH,
YOU AND ME BOTH,

05:46.166 --> 05:47.250
BUT LIFE GOES ON,
DOESN'T IT?

05:47.250 --> 05:48.500
LISTEN, YOU THINK
I COULD GET OUT
OF HERE?

05:48.500 --> 05:50.583
I'M PROBABLY
MISSING A FILMSTRIP
OR SOMETHING.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.250
YOU SEEM LIKE
A GOOD KID, PACEY.

05:54.834 --> 05:57.834
WHATEVER'S EATING
AT YOU THESE DAYS,

05:57.834 --> 06:00.500
DON'T LET IT WIN,
OK?

06:00.500 --> 06:04.250
MAYBE IT ALREADY HAS.

06:09.333 --> 06:14.250
OK, 40,000 HITS? I MUST
BE DOING SOMETHING WRONG.

06:14.250 --> 06:16.625
OH, WELL, YOU CAN'T
DO A SEARCH

06:16.625 --> 06:18.375
ON SUCH
A BROAD TOPIC
LIKE DEMOCRACY.

06:18.375 --> 06:19.375
I MEAN,
YOU'VE GOT TO DECIDE

06:19.375 --> 06:20.583
WHAT YOU WANT AND
WHAT YOU DON'T WANT,

06:20.583 --> 06:25.041
AND, THEN,
YOU KNOW, ESTABLISH
SOME RESTRICTIONS.

06:25.041 --> 06:26.625
OK. OH,
SO IT WOULD BE LIKE

06:26.625 --> 06:31.417
IF I WERE SEARCHING FOR,
SAY, A BOYFRIEND,

06:31.417 --> 06:33.375
THEN I'D WANT TO MEET
A LOT OF PEOPLE

06:33.375 --> 06:35.291
AND, UH, GET TO KNOW THEM,

06:35.291 --> 06:36.834
AND ELIMINATE THE TRULY
INCOMPATIBLE ONES.

06:36.834 --> 06:41.208
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY
SHOULD HAVE YOUR OWN
WEBSITE--

06:41.208 --> 06:43.500
WWW.ANNOYINGSISTER.COM.

06:43.500 --> 06:47.250
HA HA HA, JACK.
OK, I REALLY THINK

06:47.250 --> 06:48.750
THAT YOU SHOULD
WRITE THIS GUY BEN BACK.

06:48.750 --> 06:49.792
I MEAN, HE SEEMS
SUPER NICE,

06:49.792 --> 06:52.041
AND, YOU KNOW, HE ONLY
LIVES 2 TOWNS OVER.

06:52.041 --> 06:54.625
I MEAN, YOU GUYS COULD END UP
BEING FRIENDS, OR...

06:54.625 --> 06:55.750
OR WHAT?

06:55.750 --> 06:58.333
OR WHATEVER.

06:58.333 --> 06:59.959
PLEASE.

06:59.959 --> 07:02.250
WHAT? YOU'RE WORRIED
THAT HE HAS A BOYFRIEND.

07:02.250 --> 07:03.500
COME ON, LET ME ASSURE YOU

07:03.500 --> 07:07.083
A LOT CAN HAPPEN
BETWEEN MAY AND NOVEMBER.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.417
PROM GUY
COULD BE COMPLETELY

07:08.417 --> 07:09.625
OUT OF THE PICTURE
BY NOW.

07:09.625 --> 07:11.792
ANDIE. STOP IT.

07:11.792 --> 07:14.500
JACK, YOU HAVE TO
SEIZE THE DAY.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.291
IF YOU DON'T,
I'LL DO IT FOR YOU.

07:16.291 --> 07:18.166
I KNOW YOUR PASSWORD.

07:19.208 --> 07:21.417
JACK.

07:23.250 --> 07:25.750
WHAT? SOMEONE JUST
INSTANT MESSAGED YOU.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.458
YOU JUST HIT...

07:27.458 --> 07:29.083
OH, MY GOD, IT'S BEN STREET.
IT'S HIM! IT'S HIM!

07:29.083 --> 07:30.000
YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW.
I KNOW. WHAT DO
I DO HERE?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.417
HOW DO I MAKE
THIS THING GO AWAY?

07:31.417 --> 07:32.375
YOU DON'T MAKE IT
GO AWAY.

07:32.375 --> 07:34.291
HE'S TALKING TO YOU.
SAY SOMETHING.

07:34.291 --> 07:36.083
NOW?

07:36.083 --> 07:37.166
YEAH. HE'S WAITING.

07:37.166 --> 07:39.125
YEAH, BUT I--
TYPE.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.917
I--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M--
TYPE.

07:41.917 --> 07:44.834
GO ON.
ALL RIGHT.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.375
OK, WELL, YOU HAVE
TO HIT SEND.

07:55.792 --> 07:58.500
HEY, JOEY. JOEY.

07:58.500 --> 07:59.625
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

07:59.625 --> 08:02.792
MY, YOU ARE LOOKING
ABSOLUTELY RAVISHING TODAY.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.875
IS THAT A NEW, UH,
HAIR THINGA-MA-JIG
YOU GOT GOING THERE?

08:04.875 --> 08:06.625
YOU NEED MY NOTES
FROM TODAY'S CLASS
THAT YOU MISSED.

08:06.625 --> 08:07.917
[LAUGHS]
YOU MISS ME, HUH?

08:07.917 --> 08:09.375
OH, HOW COULD
I MISS YOU?

08:09.375 --> 08:10.333
IT'S SO MUCH EASIER
TO SEE THE BOARD

08:10.333 --> 08:11.625
WITHOUT YOUR BIG,
FAT HEAD IN THE WAY.

08:11.625 --> 08:14.917
I NEED THESE BACK
BY TOMORROW MORNING.

08:21.834 --> 08:22.667
WHAT'S A COSINE?

08:22.667 --> 08:25.959
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT A COSINE IS?

08:25.959 --> 08:30.041
YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA CATCH UP
BY MID-TERMS.

08:30.041 --> 08:30.834
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT, I'M NOT.

08:30.834 --> 08:31.834
NOT UNLESS,
OF COURSE, YOU--

08:31.834 --> 08:33.457
LOOK, I'M NOT GOING
TO HELP YOU, PACEY.

08:33.457 --> 08:34.582
I HAVE BEEN
BUSTING MY BUTT

08:34.582 --> 08:37.833
ALL SEMESTER
WHILE YOU'VE BEEN...

08:37.833 --> 08:39.207
WELL, WHO KNOWS
WHAT THE HELL

08:39.207 --> 08:39.750
YOU'VE BEEN DOING LATELY.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.166
I'VE BEEN BUSY.

08:41.166 --> 08:42.625
BUSY, RIGHT.
PACEY, YOU HAVE

08:42.625 --> 08:44.834
A VERY UNDEMANDING
PART-TIME JOB,

08:44.834 --> 08:45.625
YOUR ONLY FAMILIAL
OBLIGATION

08:45.625 --> 08:47.583
IS TO FEED THE DOG
EVERY DAY,

08:47.583 --> 08:48.500
AND YOUR SOCIAL LIFE
IS BASICALLY A TRIANGLE

08:48.500 --> 08:51.166
CONSISTING OF YOU,
ME, AND DAWSON.

08:51.166 --> 08:55.250
OK, LISTEN.
TRUTH BE TOLD?

08:55.250 --> 08:58.667
I'M FAILING MATH
RIGHT NOW. YEAH.

08:58.667 --> 08:59.959
SO, IF YOU
COULD FIND IT
IN YOUR HEART

08:59.959 --> 09:02.041
TO EXPLAIN ALL THIS
TRIG STUFF TO ME,

09:02.041 --> 09:03.834
I'D DO ANYTHING
YOU WANT.

09:05.959 --> 09:07.500
ANYTHING?

09:10.041 --> 09:13.875
SLOW, QUICK, QUICK.

09:13.875 --> 09:14.291
GOOD FOOTWORK, PEOPLE.

09:14.291 --> 09:16.500
Both: OW!

09:16.500 --> 09:19.208
I THINK YOU
SHOULD PROBABLY

09:19.208 --> 09:20.208
TELL ME WHAT
I'M DOING HERE

09:20.208 --> 09:22.250
BEFORE THE OTHER
9 SUFFER
THE SAME FATE.

09:22.250 --> 09:23.083
WELL, DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE

09:23.083 --> 09:24.000
THAT YOU ACTUALLY
HAVE CONTROL

09:24.000 --> 09:26.875
OVER THOSE LEFT FEET
OF YOURS? OW!

09:26.875 --> 09:27.875
PACEY.

09:27.875 --> 09:28.834
I'M SORRY.

09:28.834 --> 09:33.125
LOOK, EVERY YEAR,
THE STARLIGHT SCHOOL

09:33.125 --> 09:34.625
OFFERS A $1,500
SCHOLARSHIP

09:34.625 --> 09:35.625
TO THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT
WHO BEST EXEMPLIFIES

09:35.625 --> 09:38.375
THE SPIRIT AND GRACE
OF BALLROOM DANCING.

09:38.375 --> 09:39.417
NOW, IF YOU LOOK AROUND,
THERE ARE ABOUT 6 PEOPLE HERE

09:39.417 --> 09:41.375
WHO WEAR THEIR TEETH
TO BED,

09:41.375 --> 09:42.875
LET ALONE GO
TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH US.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.083
WHICH WOULD
MAKE YOU, WHAT,
A SHOO-IN?

09:45.083 --> 09:46.750
WELL, I DO
HAVE TO COMPLETE

09:46.750 --> 09:48.417
AT LEAST ONE OF
THE 2-WEEK COURSES.

09:48.417 --> 09:49.959
[SIGHS]
WHY DIDN'T YOU

09:49.959 --> 09:51.542
GET DAWSON
TO DO THIS WITH YOU?

09:51.542 --> 09:52.834
OR JACK,
FOR THAT MATTER?

09:52.834 --> 09:55.625
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
OWE ME LIKE YOU WILL

09:55.625 --> 09:57.583
AFTER I PERFORM CPR
ON YOUR MATH GRADE.

09:57.583 --> 09:59.708
SO THAT'S
THE TRADE-OFF.

09:59.708 --> 10:00.667
MM-HMM.

10:00.667 --> 10:01.458
ONE STUDY SESSION
FOR ONE DANCE CLASS.

10:01.458 --> 10:03.542
THAT'S THE TRADE-OFF.

10:03.542 --> 10:04.542
EXCELLENT.

10:04.542 --> 10:05.834
WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT RIB CAGES TOUCHING?

10:05.834 --> 10:10.083
AND REFRESH MY MEMORY.
WHO'S LEADING HERE?

10:10.083 --> 10:11.667

THE OLD COLLEGE TRY,

10:19.083 --> 10:20.750
OH.

AND SHOW YOUR WORK,

10:56.125 --> 10:57.125
DON'T JUST COPY
THE ANSWERS

10:57.125 --> 10:58.333
OUT OF THE BACK
OF THE BOOK.

10:58.333 --> 10:59.875

KNOWN THE SADISTIC
PLEASURE

10:59.875 --> 11:01.542

OUT OF TUTORING ME,

11:01.542 --> 11:03.208

LET YOU HAD SUCH
FREE REIGN.

SPEND AN HOUR

DON'T YOU,

IMPERATIVE IT IS

11:16.250 --> 11:18.583
THAT NO ONE,
AND I MEAN NO ONE,

I'M EAGER TO HAVE
THIS INFORMATION

11:32.083 --> 11:33.583
DISSEMINATED

11:33.583 --> 11:35.375
PERFECT. THEN WE'RE

NO, NO, WE CAN
TELL HIM. IT'S

11:44.750 --> 11:48.542
WE WERE, WE WERE
JUST DISCUSSING, UH,

11:48.542 --> 11:51.875
THE FACT THAT
I AM REALLY AWFUL

11:51.875 --> 11:55.500

NEVER REALLY DATING,

THEY JUST DID
THE WHOLE PROM THING

12:36.291 --> 12:37.250
AS A...
AS A STATEMENT.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.834

IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

12:52.792 --> 12:55.417
WELL, YEAH,
BUT HE SAW YOU

12:55.417 --> 12:58.417
ON THE WEB,
IN YOUR UNIFORM.
IT'S ONLY FAIR.

I'M WORKING ON

WITH PACEY.

13:40.959 --> 13:43.792
IT'S A HUMAN GROWTH
AND DEVELOPMENT
THING.

13:43.792 --> 13:44.708
IS HE HERE?

13:44.708 --> 13:46.917
UM, HE ISN'T IN
UNTIL TUESDAY.

13:46.917 --> 13:49.667
BUT HE TOLD ME
THAT HE WAS
WORKING TODAY.

13:49.667 --> 13:52.333
I MUST HAVE
GOTTEN HIM CONFUSED.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.125
THAT'S NOT SURPRISING,
CONSIDERING

13:54.125 --> 13:55.417

HE'S BEEN LATELY.

PACEY WAS ACTING
THIS WEIRD,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.792
THAT PACEY'S
OLDER WOMAN
FETISH

14:13.792 --> 14:15.208
HAS RETURNED
WITH A VENGEANCE,
DO YOU?

14:15.208 --> 14:16.250
NO, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

14:16.250 --> 14:20.166
BUT YOU'RE DEFINITELY
THINKING SOMETHING.

14:20.166 --> 14:23.834
YEAH, I...

14:23.834 --> 14:25.417
YESTERDAY, I CAME
BACK TO MY HOUSE,

14:25.417 --> 14:26.667
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE DAY

14:26.667 --> 14:28.708
AND I FOUND PACEY
SPRAWLED OUT ON MY
BEDROOM FLOOR.

14:29.625 --> 14:32.166
WOW. WAS HE ALONE?

14:32.166 --> 14:34.000
YEAH, HE WAS PLAYING
CRASH BANDICOOT.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.875

THAT'S NOT

14:35.875 --> 14:37.750
ONE OF YOUR
CLEVER EUPHEMISMS.

14:37.750 --> 14:41.041
NO, IT'S JUST A,
UH, A VIDEO GAME.

14:41.041 --> 14:42.208
GOOD.

14:42.208 --> 14:43.125
BUT...

14:43.125 --> 14:45.125
HERE'S THE WEIRD
THING, ALL RIGHT?

14:45.125 --> 14:46.750
LATER THAT NIGHT,
I FOUND A CONDOM
ON MY FLOOR.

14:46.750 --> 14:48.667
AND THEN,
WHEN I ASKED PACEY

14:48.667 --> 14:49.542
ABOUT IT
THIS MORNING,

14:49.542 --> 14:50.959
HE AND JOEY WERE
HUDDLED TOGETHER

14:50.959 --> 14:53.542
LIKE IT WAS SOME
SORT OF CONSPIRACY.

14:53.542 --> 14:55.834
HAS, UH, HAS HE SAID
ANYTHING TO YOU?

14:55.834 --> 14:58.333
I MEAN, HAVE YOU TALKED
AT ALL WITH HIM YET?

14:58.333 --> 15:00.000
NO, HE,
HE TOOK OFF,

15:00.000 --> 15:01.542
AND HE'S BEEN
DODGING ME
EVER SINCE.

15:01.542 --> 15:02.750
HMM.

15:05.166 --> 15:07.625
CAN WE TAKE A BREAK,
PLEASE?

15:07.625 --> 15:08.959
WE JUST TOOK A BREAK.
IT'S NO WONDER

15:08.959 --> 15:10.875
YOU'RE SO FAR BEHIND.
I SWEAR, ALEXANDER

15:10.875 --> 15:11.959
CAN SIT STILL
LONGER THAN YOU CAN.

15:11.959 --> 15:14.959
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:14.959 --> 15:16.625
IT'S JUST THAT,
RECENTLY,

15:16.625 --> 15:17.708
WHENEVER I CRACK
A BOOK TO STUDY,

15:17.708 --> 15:19.834
IT'S LIKE
I AUTOMATICALLY

15:19.834 --> 15:21.125
WANT TO BE DOING
SOMETHING ELSE.

15:21.125 --> 15:23.583
ANYTHING ELSE.
I MEAN,

15:23.583 --> 15:25.083
IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT UNDER

15:25.083 --> 15:26.917
THE PREVIOUS REGIMES
IN MY LIFE,

15:26.917 --> 15:28.750
EVERY TIME
I WAS STUDYING,

15:28.750 --> 15:29.834
I WAS GIVEN A REWARD.

15:29.834 --> 15:32.250
I OFFERED YOU
CHEX MIX.

15:32.250 --> 15:34.000
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT CHEX MIX.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.250
I'M TALKING ABOUT TOMORROW,
AND I'M TALKING ABOUT ANDIE.

15:36.250 --> 15:39.708
LET'S JUST SAY
THAT THOSE 2 LADIES,

15:39.708 --> 15:46.041
THEY TRAINED ME TO ACQUAINT
STUDYING WITH...

15:46.041 --> 15:47.000
WITH WHAT?

15:47.000 --> 15:50.125
SEX. I EQUATE STUDYING
WITH SEX.

15:50.125 --> 15:52.125
SEX WITH STUDYING.
NOW I GET THE STUDYING

15:52.125 --> 15:53.417
BUT NO SEX.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

15:53.417 --> 15:55.542
SO IT'S A LITTLE HARD
TO GET MOTIVATED
THESE DAYS.

15:55.542 --> 15:57.208
SO WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING IS THAT

15:57.208 --> 15:59.083
YOU'RE MERELY
THE INNOCENT VICTIM

15:59.083 --> 16:02.083
IN SOME BEHAVIORAL
PSYCHOLOGY EXPERIMENT

16:05.583 --> 16:06.834
YEAH.

16:06.834 --> 16:08.083
AND THAT YOU'RE
DESPERATELY IN NEED

16:08.083 --> 16:10.542
OF SOME ABLE-BODIED
FEMALE

16:10.542 --> 16:13.625
TO HELP YOU
PROVOKE THOSE
PRE-CONDITIONED,

16:13.625 --> 16:15.125

HOMEWORK RESPONSES?

16:15.125 --> 16:16.291
YES.

16:16.291 --> 16:19.917
THAT IS THE WORST
PICK-UP LINE

16:19.917 --> 16:21.458
I HAVE EVER HEARD,
PACEY.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.458
THANKS, TOOTS,
BUT I WASN'T
HITTING ON YOU.

16:23.458 --> 16:27.375

I HAVE MY OWN PROSPECTS,
THANKS.

16:27.375 --> 16:32.125

LIKE WHO?

16:32.125 --> 16:34.125

YOU...

16:34.125 --> 16:36.458
FOR RIGHT NOW,

16:36.458 --> 16:38.625
THEY WOULD PREFER
TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS.

16:38.625 --> 16:39.834
BUT LET ME TELL YOU,
THEY'VE MADE IT CLEAR TO ME

16:39.834 --> 16:43.083
IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS,
SHOULD THE MUTUAL DESIRE OCCUR,

16:43.083 --> 16:45.166
THAT THEY WILL BE
MORE THAN WILLING

16:45.166 --> 16:47.417
TO TAKE CARE OF ALL
MY PHYSICAL NEEDS,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

16:47.417 --> 16:49.166
SO IS THIS A POTENTIAL
RELATIONSHIP,

16:49.166 --> 16:51.750
OR ARE WE TALKING
A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT?

16:51.750 --> 16:56.458
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

16:56.458 --> 16:59.667
IF YOU HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY

16:59.667 --> 17:02.500
TO BE WITH SOMEBODY,
NO QUESTIONS ASKED,

17:02.500 --> 17:05.916
NO STRINGS ATTACHED,
NO AWKWARD FIRST DATES,

17:05.916 --> 17:09.333
NO WAITING BY THE PHONE,
NO ANY OF THAT,

17:09.333 --> 17:12.333
TOTALLY ON THE SURFACE.
100% CASUAL.

17:12.333 --> 17:15.916
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
WOULD YOU GO FOR IT?

17:15.916 --> 17:18.916
A TOTALLY EMPTY,
EMOTIONALLY
UNFULFILLING

17:18.916 --> 17:20.583
SEXUAL EXPERIENCE?
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

17:20.583 --> 17:21.625
YOU'RE NOT
LISTENING TO ME.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.750
I'M BEING SERIOUS,
BUT IT'S KIND OF

17:23.750 --> 17:27.290
A LIMITED TIME OFFER.
SO I JUST THOUGHT
I'D ASK YOU.

17:27.290 --> 17:28.541
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

17:28.541 --> 17:34.041
PACEY, I THINK THAT
IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO BE

17:34.041 --> 17:35.208
HAVING CASUAL SEX
WITH SOMEONE RIGHT NOW,

17:35.208 --> 17:38.834
YOU'D BE DOING IT,
INSTEAD OF SITTING HERE,

17:38.834 --> 17:41.041
HAVING A HYPOTHETICAL
DISCUSSION ABOUT IT.

17:41.041 --> 17:43.500
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

17:45.959 --> 17:49.542
OH, COME ON, ALREADY.
YEAH.

17:49.542 --> 17:51.208
OK, ALL RIGHT.

17:51.208 --> 17:52.291
ALL RIGHT, IT'S,
IT'S HAPPENING.

17:54.583 --> 17:59.667
OOH, NOT BAD.

17:59.667 --> 18:01.166
YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.

18:01.166 --> 18:04.208
JACK, DID YOU ACTUALLY
EXPRESS ATTRACTION

18:04.208 --> 18:05.792
TO A MEMBER
OF THE MALE SPECIES?

18:05.792 --> 18:07.750
COME ON, THIS
IS COMPLETELY
EMPIRICAL.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.125
I MEAN, ANYONE
WOULD BE ATTRACTED

18:10.125 --> 18:13.750
TO THAT EXTREMELY
ATTRACTIVE GUY.

18:13.750 --> 18:16.166
AND I SENSE A BLUSH?

18:16.166 --> 18:18.250
"SO, WHAT DO
YOU THINK?"

18:18.250 --> 18:19.583
HE WANTS TO KNOW
WHAT I THINK.

18:19.583 --> 18:22.417
OK, SO YOU
TELL HIM THAT...

18:22.417 --> 18:24.083
THAT YOU THINK THAT HE SHOULD
TRAVEL 2 TOWNS OVER.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.083
NO, I CAN'T DO THAT.

18:25.083 --> 18:26.333
YOU CAN, AND YOU WILL.

18:26.333 --> 18:29.041
ANDIE, COME ON,
THIS IS, THIS IS
WAY, WAY TOO FAST.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.834
OK, SO YOU
TELL HIM THAT

18:30.834 --> 18:31.792
YOU WANT TO MEET
FOR COFFEE.

18:31.792 --> 18:33.166
I MEAN, I CAN GO
WITH YOU IF YOU WANT.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.959
YEAH, THAT WILL BE
A LOT OF FUN.

18:34.959 --> 18:37.291
OK, JACK. AGREE TO MEET
AT SOME

18:37.291 --> 18:39.166
VERY SAFE, VERY WELL LIT
PUBLIC PLACE.

18:39.166 --> 18:41.834
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
LIKE WE HAVEN'T DONE

18:41.834 --> 18:43.750
AN EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND
CHECK ON THE GUY

18:43.750 --> 18:44.750
TO KNOW THAT HE'S
FOR REAL.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.041
YEAH, I, BUT LOOK,
I CAN'T, ALL RIGHT,

18:46.041 --> 18:48.458
LOOK AT ME,
I'M SHAKING.

18:48.458 --> 18:50.959
FINE, JACK.
YOU'RE JUST NERVOUS. HERE.

18:50.959 --> 18:57.250
UM, THE PICTURE WAS GREAT.
WHAT CAN I SAY?

18:57.250 --> 19:00.959
WANT TO MEET TONIGHT
FOR COFFEE?

19:04.000 --> 19:07.166
Both: "I THOUGHT
YOU'D NEVER ASK."

19:07.166 --> 19:09.750
OH!
[LAUGHS]

19:15.291 --> 19:16.208
DAWSON, I DON'T KNOW
HOW THE HELL

19:16.208 --> 19:17.458
YOU SUCKERED ME
INTO HELPING YOU

19:17.458 --> 19:21.625
WITH YOUR CENTENNIAL
HITCHCOCK WINDOW
DISPLAY.

19:21.625 --> 19:22.500
IT NEEDED
A WOMAN'S TOUCH.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.917
WELL, I SUPPOSE
THAT'S WHERE PACEY

19:23.917 --> 19:26.458
USUALLY COMES IN,
HUH?

19:26.458 --> 19:28.834
NO, PACEY'S USUALLY
IN THE BACK SLEEPING
WHEN I'M DOING THIS.

19:28.834 --> 19:32.166
[LAUGHS]
ALL RIGHT.

19:33.792 --> 19:36.458
OH, MAYBE HE'S
REDISCOVERED
HIS WORK ETHIC.

19:36.458 --> 19:37.875
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:37.875 --> 19:40.417
PACEY. 2 O'CLOCK.

19:47.834 --> 19:49.458
IS THAT JOEY?

19:56.208 --> 19:57.166
DAWSON, DO YOU HAVE
ONE OF THOSE

19:57.166 --> 19:59.667
LITTLE SIGNS THAT SAYS
"BACK IN 5?"

19:59.667 --> 20:02.708
YEAH.

20:09.417 --> 20:12.417
OK, SO JOEY
AND PACEY ARE
AUDITIONING

20:12.417 --> 20:14.375
FOR CAPESIDE
DINNER THEATER'S
VERSION

20:14.375 --> 20:15.875
OF STRICTLY
BALLROOM.

20:15.875 --> 20:17.792
LET'S GET OUT
OF HERE, DAWSON.

20:17.792 --> 20:18.708
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

20:18.708 --> 20:20.792
EXCELLENT.
2 MORE YOUNG PEOPLE

20:20.792 --> 20:22.333
EAGER TO LEARN
THE SOPHISTICATED ART

20:22.333 --> 20:24.583
OF BALLROOM DANCING.
AND PEOPLE SAY

20:24.583 --> 20:26.083
KIDS THESE DAYS
HAVE NO APPRECIATION

20:26.083 --> 20:27.000
FOR THE FINER THINGS
IN LIFE.

20:27.000 --> 20:27.917
ACTUALLY, WE'RE
NOT HERE TO DANCE.

20:27.917 --> 20:29.083
WE'RE JUST LOOKING
FOR SOME FRIENDS.

20:29.083 --> 20:31.083
OK, GOOD. WELL,
WHILE YOU LOOK,
YOU DANCE. OK?

20:31.083 --> 20:32.875
ATTENTION, EVERYBODY,

20:32.875 --> 20:35.250
LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE YET
ANOTHER SET

20:35.250 --> 20:38.250
OF DELIGHTFUL
YOUNG PEOPLE
JOINING OUR CLASS.

20:38.250 --> 20:39.708
MUST BE SOMETHING
IN THE AIR.

20:39.708 --> 20:43.500
[APPLAUSE]

20:51.625 --> 20:55.000
AND WHAT, PRAY TELL,
ARE YOU 2 DOING HERE?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.959
JUST ENJOYING
THE FINE ART
OF BALLROOM DANCING.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.875
DIDN'T I SAY
YOU TWO WOULD
BE NATURALS?

21:01.875 --> 21:03.458
MUCH BETTER
THAN THESE 2,

21:03.458 --> 21:05.417
AND THEY'VE BEEN
HERE ALL WEEK.

21:05.417 --> 21:07.208
BUT YOU USED TO DATE,
DIDN'T YOU?

21:07.208 --> 21:09.583
UH, NOT RIGHT NOW, OK?

21:09.583 --> 21:11.000
I'M RIGHT, AREN'T I?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.625
YOU DATED,
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT,

21:12.625 --> 21:15.166
BUT THEN YOU GOT PAST
ALL OF YOUR ISSUES,

21:15.166 --> 21:18.583
AND NOW YOU ACTUALLY
TRUST EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

21:18.583 --> 21:20.542
SEE, YOU CAN SEE THAT
IN THE DANCING.

21:20.542 --> 21:23.375
YOU CAN SEE THAT
THE TRUST IS THERE.

21:23.375 --> 21:26.667
NOW THESE 2,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

21:26.667 --> 21:28.583
A WHOLE
DIFFERENT STORY.

21:28.583 --> 21:32.542
I MEAN, LOOK AT THEM.
LOOK AT THEIR FORM.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.333
LOOK AT THE TENSION
IN THEIR ARMS.

21:34.333 --> 21:36.125
OK, IS THERE SOME
SORT OF PROBLEM HERE?

21:36.125 --> 21:37.291
WELL, WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT RIB CAGES
TOUCHING?

21:37.291 --> 21:39.917
CAN WE DO THAT?
NO, SORRY.

21:39.917 --> 21:41.125
IT'S JUST NOT GONNA
HAPPEN, ALL RIGHT?

21:41.125 --> 21:42.959
RIGHT. YOU SEE
WHAT I MEAN?

21:42.959 --> 21:44.125
SEE THE HOSTILITY,

21:44.125 --> 21:45.792
THE WAY THEY'RE WARY
WITH EACH OTHER,

21:45.792 --> 21:48.625
NOT TO MENTION
THE CONSTANT BICKERING
AND NAME-CALLING.

21:48.625 --> 21:52.750
NOW, THESE 2 CLEARLY
ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES

21:52.750 --> 21:53.875
OF SOME SCREWBALL
MATING RITUAL.

21:53.875 --> 21:55.417
WHAT?

21:55.417 --> 21:58.792
OK, YOU'VE GOT IT
ALL WRONG, LADY.

21:58.792 --> 21:59.792
REALLY, I DO?

21:59.792 --> 22:00.792
OH, COMPLETELY.

22:00.792 --> 22:01.792
ACTUALLY, YOU COULD
NOT BE MORE WRONG.

22:01.792 --> 22:04.792
OK, THERE'S ENOUGH
SEXUAL TENSION HERE

22:04.792 --> 22:06.834
TO POWER A KISS
REUNION TOUR.

22:06.834 --> 22:08.250
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME

22:08.250 --> 22:10.834
I SAW DANCING
THIS BAD.

22:10.834 --> 22:12.333
TRUE.

22:12.333 --> 22:13.208
WAIT A MINUTE,
JUST BECAUSE
THEY CAN'T DANCE,

22:13.208 --> 22:14.375
YOU THINK
THAT THEY'RE--

22:14.375 --> 22:16.625
WELL, IT'S THIS THEORY
THAT I'VE DEVELOPED

22:16.625 --> 22:17.917
BASED ON YEARS
OF EXPERIENCE.

22:17.917 --> 22:18.917
IF PEOPLE DANCE
THAT BADLY,

22:18.917 --> 22:21.041
THEN THEY'RE USUALLY
HOT FOR EACH OTHER.

22:21.041 --> 22:23.667
THE DANCING DOESN'T LIE.

22:24.208 --> 22:26.041
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE.

22:26.041 --> 22:28.625
LET'S TAKE IT
FROM THE TOP.
[CLAPS]

22:32.458 --> 22:33.458
HEY.

22:33.458 --> 22:35.750
MRS. RYAN
LET ME IN.

22:35.750 --> 22:36.917
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE WEARING?

22:36.917 --> 22:38.250
GOOD NIGHT, ANDIE.

22:38.250 --> 22:41.250
NO. I JUST LIKE YOU
BETTER IN BLUE.
YOU LOOK FINE.

22:41.250 --> 22:42.834
BETTER THAN FINE.
YOU ALWAYS LOOK FINE.

22:42.834 --> 22:43.875
MARKY MARK-WORTHY.

22:43.875 --> 22:45.083
I SENSE A PEP TALK
COMING ON.

22:45.083 --> 22:48.291
OK. JACK, LOOK,

22:48.291 --> 22:49.834
I'M YOUR SISTER
AND I LOVE YOU,

22:49.834 --> 22:53.542
AND YOUR ROMANTIC FUTURE
IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.

22:53.542 --> 22:56.166
BECAUSE IF I WIND UP
AN EMBITTERED OLD MAID,

22:56.166 --> 22:57.708
I'M COMING TO LIVE WITH YOU
AND YOUR BOYFRIEND.

22:57.708 --> 22:58.834
SO YOU'RE FAIRLY CERTAIN
THAT I'M ACTUALLY GONNA
HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

22:58.834 --> 23:00.166
SURE.

23:00.166 --> 23:02.375
IT HASN'T OCCURRED
TO YOU

23:02.375 --> 23:04.041
THAT THIS WHOLE
ONLINE THING

23:04.041 --> 23:05.667
COULD BE A COMPLETE
DISASTER?

23:05.667 --> 23:07.333
OK, JACK,
WORST-CASE SCENARIO--

23:07.333 --> 23:08.500
YOU SHOW UP,

23:08.500 --> 23:10.708
YOU MEET EACH OTHER,
YOU HATE EACH OTHER,

23:10.708 --> 23:13.375
YOU DRINK YOUR MOCHACCINOS,
AND YOU GO YOUR SEPARATE WAYS.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.875
BUT THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN, JACK.

23:15.875 --> 23:17.125
I HAVE A REALLY GOOD
FEELING ABOUT THIS.

23:17.125 --> 23:18.542
I'M GLAD SOMEONE
DOES.

23:18.542 --> 23:21.291
JACK, THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE NERVOUS.

23:21.291 --> 23:22.667
BEN OBVIOUSLY LIKES YOU.

23:22.667 --> 23:25.291
I DON'T EVEN KNOW BEN.
BEN DOESN'T KNOW ME.

23:25.291 --> 23:27.875
THUS THE REASON
FOR HAVING COFFEE.

23:27.875 --> 23:29.375
ANDIE,
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.792
THIS IS A WHOLE NEW
LEVEL OF MY LIFE

23:31.792 --> 23:34.542
THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I'M READY FOR.

23:34.542 --> 23:36.250
WHEN I WALK
THROUGH THAT DOOR

23:36.250 --> 23:38.708
AND I SAY HELLO
TO THIS GUY,

23:38.708 --> 23:43.250
MY ENTIRE LIFE
IS GONNA BE DIFFERENT.

23:43.250 --> 23:46.417
I'M NOT JUST GONNA BE
TELLING THE WORLD
THAT I'M GAY.

23:49.250 --> 23:51.083
I'M ACTUALLY
GONNA BE GAY.

23:51.083 --> 23:53.667
JACK...

23:56.083 --> 23:57.417
YOU'LL BE GAY, ANYWAY.

23:57.417 --> 23:59.708
I MEAN, IF YOU DON'T GO,

23:59.708 --> 24:02.500
YOU'LL BE GAY
AND WITHOUT A BOYFRIEND.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.250
YEAH.

24:07.250 --> 24:07.625
OK?

24:10.834 --> 24:13.333
OK, PEOPLE, WE'RE GONNA
PLAY A LITTLE GAME.

24:13.333 --> 24:15.417
I WANT YOU TO CONSIDER THIS
MUSICAL PARTNERS

24:15.417 --> 24:18.041
INSTEAD OF
MUSICAL CHAIRS, OK?

24:18.041 --> 24:19.125
I WANT YOU TWO.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.000
YOU TWO, YOU TWO,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.417
YOU TWO.

24:23.417 --> 24:25.875
YOU TWO.
THANK YOU.

24:25.875 --> 24:26.917
YOU TWO.

24:26.917 --> 24:30.667
WHAT? NO.
I THINK YOU
MUST'VE MEANT...

24:30.667 --> 24:32.125
SOME SORT
OF MISTAKE HERE.

24:32.125 --> 24:32.875
COME ON, CHILDREN,
PLAY NICE.

24:32.875 --> 24:35.917
OK. WE ARE GOING
TO DANCE--

24:35.917 --> 24:37.417
HAPPILY, JOYOUSLY,
ENTHUSIASTICALLY,

24:37.417 --> 24:39.375
BECAUSE WE LOVE
TO DANCE.

24:39.375 --> 24:42.625
NOW, WHEN YOU HEAR
THE MUSIC STOP

24:42.625 --> 24:44.166
AND I YELL "SWITCH,"

24:44.166 --> 24:45.250
I WANT YOU
TO STOP DANCING

24:45.250 --> 24:47.542
AND REACH FOR THE NEAREST
AVAILABLE PARTNER.

24:47.542 --> 24:48.750
ALL RIGHT?

24:50.125 --> 24:52.208
SO WHEN DID YOU
AND PACEY DISCOVER

24:52.208 --> 24:53.542
YOUR MUTUAL LOVE
OF BALLROOM DANCING?

24:53.542 --> 24:55.834
OBVIOUSLY, JUST MOMENTS
BEFORE YOU AND DAWSON DID.

24:55.834 --> 24:57.625
[MUSIC PLAYS]

25:00.583 --> 25:03.208
I CAN'T GET OVER
HOW WEIRD IT WAS

25:03.208 --> 25:04.333
TO SEE YOU IN MY ROOM
THE OTHER DAY.

25:04.333 --> 25:05.708
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:05.708 --> 25:08.667
WHAT? NOT EVERYBODY'S GOT
THE DAZZLING ARRAY
OF ELECTRONICS

25:08.667 --> 25:10.417
AVAILABLE TO THEM
IN THEIR BEDROOM
THAT YOU DO.

25:10.417 --> 25:11.792
AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
THAT YOU WERE IN MY HOUSE

25:11.792 --> 25:12.250
WHEN I WASN'T THERE?

25:12.250 --> 25:14.125
NO. NO, NO.

25:14.125 --> 25:16.667
THERE'S ALWAYS THE LURE
OF THE LEERY KITCHEN,

25:16.667 --> 25:18.166
WHICH I HAVE TO SAY
HAS KIND OF LOST
ITS LUSTER

25:18.166 --> 25:19.500
IN MITCH'S REIGN OF TERROR.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.667
SO WHAT WAS
THE CONDOM FOR?

25:20.667 --> 25:21.834
THE WHAT?

25:21.834 --> 25:23.083
THE CONDOM I FOUND
IN MY ROOM.

25:23.083 --> 25:24.583
Penny: SWITCH.

25:24.583 --> 25:25.625
EXCUSE ME
FOR A SECOND.

25:27.583 --> 25:29.834
WE'RE DEAD.
HE FOUND THE CONDOM.

25:29.834 --> 25:31.458
I KNOW. I'VE ALREADY
TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT.

25:31.458 --> 25:32.792
I WOULDN'T WORRY.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.667
REALLY? YOU DON'T THINK
DAWSON'S GONNA MIND

25:34.667 --> 25:36.166
THAT WE'VE BEEN MAPPING
OUT EACH OTHER'S
EROGENOUS ZONES

25:36.166 --> 25:37.166
BETWEEN HIS SHEETS?

25:37.166 --> 25:39.000
THE QUESTION'S MOOT.
HE'S NOT ON TO US.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.166
HE'S NOT?

25:40.166 --> 25:43.250
NO. WELL, AT LEAST
HE'S NOT ON TO ME.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.542
HE'S CAST SOMEBODY ELSE
AS THE FEMALE LEAD.

25:45.542 --> 25:49.250
SO WHEN DID YOU
DISCOVER YOUR LOVE
FOR BALLROOM DANCING?

25:49.250 --> 25:51.166
I READ ABOUT
SOME SCHOLARSHIP

25:51.166 --> 25:52.875
THAT THEY
WERE HAVING.

25:52.875 --> 25:54.208
SCHOLARSHIP?

25:54.208 --> 25:56.625
AND I NEEDED
A PARTNER, SO...

25:56.625 --> 26:00.041
SO...WHY'D YOU
ASK PACEY?

26:00.041 --> 26:01.750
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST ASK ME?

26:03.041 --> 26:05.125
PACEY CAME TO ME FIRST.

26:05.125 --> 26:07.750
HE NEEDED HELP WITH MATH.
I NEEDED HELP WITH THIS.

26:07.750 --> 26:09.542
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS DO,
DAWSON.

26:09.542 --> 26:10.542
THEY HELP EACH OTHER.

26:10.542 --> 26:12.875
THAT'S ALL YOU GUYS ARE
IS FRIENDS?

26:12.875 --> 26:14.708
Penny: AND SWITCH.

26:14.708 --> 26:16.542
EXCUSE US FOR A SECOND.

26:16.542 --> 26:17.875
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

26:20.208 --> 26:21.834
WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM?

26:21.834 --> 26:23.208
UH, NOTHING, REALLY.

26:23.208 --> 26:26.708
IT'S JUST, UM, DAWSON
SEEMS TO THINK THAT
WE'RE DOING IT.

26:26.708 --> 26:27.625
WHAT?

26:27.625 --> 26:30.917
WELL, YOU KNOW,
HAVING SEX,

26:30.917 --> 26:33.166
GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER
IN THE BIBLICAL SENSE.

26:33.166 --> 26:34.583
UH...

26:34.583 --> 26:37.708
PACEY, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
AND HE WOULD NEVER THINK THAT.

26:37.708 --> 26:41.417
NO, NOT UNDER
NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES,

26:41.417 --> 26:45.291
BUT IN THIS CASE,
I THINK CERTAIN EVENTS
WERE PERHAPS MISCONSTRUED.

26:45.291 --> 26:46.083
WHAT EVENTS?

26:46.083 --> 26:48.500
Penny: SWITCH!
WELL, I JUST--

26:50.333 --> 26:53.792
OK, SO...WANNA JUST TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:53.792 --> 26:57.500
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK,
DAWSON, NOT EVEN CLOSE.

26:57.500 --> 26:58.667
HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

26:58.667 --> 27:00.166
BECAUSE, MAN, IT'S WRITTEN
ALL OVER YOUR FACE, OK?

27:00.166 --> 27:03.083
YES, ME AND JOEY
HAVE BEEN SPENDING A LOT
OF TIME TOGETHER RECENTLY

27:03.083 --> 27:06.208
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN HERE
TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO
BALLROOM DANCE,

27:06.208 --> 27:08.583
AND THEN SHE'S TEACHING ME
A LITTLE TRIGONOMETRY.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.333
YOU KNOW WHAT'S MUCH MORE
INTERESTING TO ME

27:10.333 --> 27:12.333
IS THAT ALL OF THE POSSIBLE
BLOND AND BRUNETTE
COMBINATIONS

27:12.333 --> 27:13.792
OF WOMEN THAT
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW,

27:13.792 --> 27:16.125
THE FIRST ONE THAT POPPED
INTO YOUR MIND IS JOEY.
WHY IS THAT?

27:16.125 --> 27:17.000
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
GET OUT OF THIS

27:17.000 --> 27:18.959
BY ATTEMPTING
TO PSYCHOANALYZE ME.

27:18.959 --> 27:20.625
I'M JUST ASKING
A SIMPLE QUESTION.

27:20.625 --> 27:21.959
DAWSON, YOU AND JOEY--

27:21.959 --> 27:24.375
SHE'S NOT YOUR
GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE.

27:24.375 --> 27:25.792
YOU'RE RIGHT, SHE'S NOT.

27:25.792 --> 27:29.458
RIGHT. SO THE WHY ARE WE
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION?

27:30.792 --> 27:32.166
YOU SEE WHERE
I'M GOING WITH THIS?

27:32.166 --> 27:33.583
YOU'RE THE SAME GUY WHO
TOLD ME A COUPLE WEEKS AGO

27:33.583 --> 27:35.625
THAT THE TWO OF YOU
JUST NEEDED TO GO
YOUR SEPARATE WAYS.

27:35.625 --> 27:37.208
YEAH, WE DO NEED TO GO
OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

27:37.208 --> 27:38.625
IT JUST NEVER OCCURRED
TO ME--

27:38.625 --> 27:41.667
THAT WHAT? THAT SHE
WOULD ACTUALLY GO HER
SEPARATE WAY, TOO?

27:41.667 --> 27:43.333
OR PERHAPS IT DIDN'T
OCCUR TO YOU

27:43.333 --> 27:46.417
THAT HER SEPARATE WAY WOULD
INCLUDE A STOPOVER AT ME.
IS THAT WHAT IT IS?

27:48.291 --> 27:50.750
GOD, MAN, THIS IS THE WAY
IT ALWAYS IS WITH YOU.

27:50.750 --> 27:51.834
YOU TALK AND TALK, BUT YOU
DON'T LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

27:51.834 --> 27:54.250
YOU SAY YOU'RE OVER HER,
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

27:54.250 --> 27:56.625
THEY'RE JUST WORDS.
THEY DON'T MEAN
ANYTHING TO YOU.

27:56.625 --> 27:58.000
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.792
HEH. LOOK AT
THAT GIRL, DAWSON.

28:00.792 --> 28:03.250
JUST TAKE A GOOD LOOK.

28:03.250 --> 28:04.500
SHE'S A FREAKING GODDESS.

28:04.500 --> 28:05.792
HOW LONG DID YOU
THINK IT WAS GONNA BE

28:05.792 --> 28:08.500
BEFORE SOME GUY COMES ALONG
AND IS INTERESTED IN HER?

28:08.500 --> 28:09.542
I MEAN, REALLY,
DUDE.

28:09.542 --> 28:11.625
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

28:11.625 --> 28:13.667
I'M JUST GONNA
TAKE IT ALL AS IT COMES.

28:13.667 --> 28:15.041
YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE IT AS IT COMES.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.500
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD START
FIGURING OUT RIGHT NOW.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.959
BECAUSE THE GUY THAT
COMES ALONG IS NOT GONNA
BE YOUR BEST FRIEND,

28:18.959 --> 28:20.458
AND HE'S NOT GONNA
ASK FOR YOUR PERMISSION.

28:20.458 --> 28:22.500
THE GUY THAT COMES ALONG
IS GONNA TAKE ONE LOOK
AT THAT WOMAN

28:22.500 --> 28:24.333
AND JUST CUT RIGHT IN
ON YOU.

28:24.333 --> 28:25.625
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING,
PACEY?

28:25.625 --> 28:27.333
WHAT?

28:27.333 --> 28:29.000
ALL THIS ANALYSIS
OF MY LOVE LIFE
DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT

28:29.000 --> 28:31.166
THAT YOU HAVEN'T ANSWERED
MY ORIGINAL QUESTION.

28:31.166 --> 28:33.208
WHY DID I FIND THAT CONDOM?

28:33.208 --> 28:34.333
Penny: SWITCH!

28:44.834 --> 28:46.917
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT GUY.

28:46.917 --> 28:49.417
PACEY, CHILL OUT.

28:52.166 --> 28:53.041
HERE WE ARE AGAIN,

28:53.041 --> 28:55.208
THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY
THE STORY LINE

28:55.208 --> 28:57.458
IS STARTING TO STRETCH
THE LIMITS OF BELIEVABILITY.

28:57.458 --> 28:59.250
MEANING WHAT?

28:59.250 --> 29:03.041
MEANING THAT
WE'RE 2 RED-BLOODED
AMERICAN TEENAGERS

29:03.041 --> 29:05.375
WHO, WEEKS AGO, MADE
THE ENLIGHTENED DECISIONS

29:05.375 --> 29:06.834
NOT TO KEEP OUR BODIES
TO OURSELVES.

29:06.834 --> 29:10.208
AND WHAT DO WE HAVE
TO SHOW FOR IT? NOTHING.

29:10.208 --> 29:13.417
NOTHING. HOW IS THAT
POSSIBLE?

29:13.417 --> 29:15.583
I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME
TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT,

29:15.583 --> 29:18.250
AND FRANKLY, I'M JUST
DRAWING A BLANK.

29:18.250 --> 29:22.917
PACEY, IT'S FOR ABOUT
A MILLION DIFFERENT REASONS.

29:22.917 --> 29:26.917
REALLY? DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
HIT ME WITH A COUPLE

29:26.917 --> 29:29.166
SO IT WOULD MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER?

29:29.166 --> 29:34.667
OK, HOW ABOUT THE FACT THAT
OUR MOTHERS TEACH US TO BE
EMBARRASSED ABOUT SEX?

29:36.834 --> 29:40.291
OR THAT WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY
THAT THINKS VIOLENCE
IS COOL,

29:40.291 --> 29:43.583
BUT GETS SQUEAMISH
WHEN 2 PEOPLE UNDER
LEGAL VOTING AGE

29:43.583 --> 29:47.041
START USING
THE CORRECT TERMS FOR
EACH OTHER'S BODY PARTS?

30:02.125 --> 30:04.125
PACEY, IS THIS YOUR
NOT-SO-SUBTLE WAY
OF TELLING ME

30:04.125 --> 30:09.667
THAT YOU'RE READY
FOR A RETURN
TO WITCH ISLAND?

30:10.834 --> 30:12.959
MAYBE IT WAS THE DANCING

30:12.959 --> 30:17.708
OR PERHAPS IT'S JUST
THE ROMANTIC SETTING
OF THIS COAT ROOM,

30:17.708 --> 30:21.667
BUT...I AM DEFINITELY GETTING
THAT WITCHY FEELING.

31:01.542 --> 31:05.000
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN
TO ACCUSE YOU OF ANYTHING,

31:05.000 --> 31:05.917
BUT SOMETHING REALLY STRANGE
IS GOING ON HERE.

31:05.917 --> 31:08.000
PACEY'S NOT
SLEEPING WITH YOU,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.083
HE'S DEFINITELY
SLEEPING WITH SOMEBODY.

31:13.834 --> 31:15.250
[CHUCKLES]

31:27.375 --> 31:29.959
WHOA. WHAT DO
WE HAVE HERE?

31:30.708 --> 31:33.291
IT'S...NOTHING, RIGHT?

31:35.125 --> 31:36.708
YEAH, NOTHING.

31:36.708 --> 31:39.291
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
NOTHING.

31:39.291 --> 31:41.959
BELIEVE ME, WE'VE DONE
EXHAUSTIVE RESEARCH
IN THIS AREA.

31:41.959 --> 31:43.083
IT'S NOTHING.

31:44.875 --> 31:47.500
PACEY AND I
ARE JUST FRIENDS.

31:47.500 --> 31:50.375
IS THAT WHAT THE KIDS
ARE CALLING IT THESE DAYS?

31:50.375 --> 31:53.000
YOU GUYS ARE SO STUPID.
YOU'RE BOTH GONNA GET HURT--

31:53.000 --> 31:55.375
NOBODY IS GONNA
GET HURT BY THIS.

31:55.375 --> 31:59.250
WE BOTH AGREED THAT
NEITHER OF US HAVE
OUR EMOTIONS IN IT.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.750
AND YOU'RE PROUD
OF THAT FACT?

32:01.750 --> 32:03.708
JOEY, WE'RE JUST
MESSING AROUND.

32:04.792 --> 32:05.708
DAWSON?

32:05.708 --> 32:08.250
THEY LOST ME AT "NOTHING."

32:08.250 --> 32:10.583
PACEY, THIS ISN'T YOU.

32:10.583 --> 32:13.750
I MEAN, JEN, MAYBE YOU'RE
TRYING TO PROVE SOMETHING
TO SOMEBODY ABOUT--

32:13.750 --> 32:15.250
WHOA, HEY, SLOW DOWN.

32:15.250 --> 32:18.125
THIS WAS AS MUCH MY DECISION
AS IT WAS HERS, OK?

32:18.125 --> 32:20.333
SO IT THAT WHY YOU NAMED
YOUR BOAT TRUE LOVE?

32:20.333 --> 32:24.417
BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S OK
FOR CASUAL ACQUAINTANCES
OR EVEN FRIENDS

32:24.417 --> 32:26.041
TO, YOU KNOW, USE EACH OTHER
AS SCRATCHING POSTS?

32:26.041 --> 32:27.917
I KNEW YOU WEREN'T
GONNA UNDERSTAND.

32:27.917 --> 32:30.834
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I UNDERSTAND.

32:30.834 --> 32:33.083
I UNDERSTAND JUST FINE.

32:45.291 --> 32:47.834
I'VE NEVER IN MY LIFE
SEEN SOMEBODY

32:47.834 --> 32:51.291
SO WORKED UP
OVER JUST A KISS.

32:51.291 --> 32:54.000
I DON'T THINK
IT WAS JUST THE KISS.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.750
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

32:55.750 --> 33:01.250
I MEAN THAT JOEY KNOWS
ABOUT OUR ARRANGEMENT.

33:04.875 --> 33:07.417
HOW COULD SHE
POSSIBLY KNOW, PACEY?

33:07.417 --> 33:13.458
BECAUSE I WENT TO HER
FOR SOME HYPOTHETICAL ADVICE,

33:13.458 --> 33:15.458
BUT WHEN SHE SAW US KISSING,

33:15.458 --> 33:18.291
I'M PRETTY SURE SHE FIGURED OUT
IT WASN'T SO HYPOTHETICAL.

33:21.125 --> 33:23.708
YOU WENT TO JOEY
FOR ADVICE ABOUT US?

33:23.708 --> 33:26.583
YEAH, I KNOW,
NOT SO SMART, HUH?

33:26.583 --> 33:28.667
SMART OR NOT SMART,
IT'S JUST...

33:28.667 --> 33:31.250
FUNNY YOU WENT TO HER.

33:31.250 --> 33:34.667
WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY
THAT I WENT TO HER.

33:34.667 --> 33:38.500
SHE JUST KIND OF HAPPENED
TO BE THERE. WE WERE STUDYING.

33:38.500 --> 33:41.000
CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING, PACEY?
WHAT IS IT ABOUT HER?

33:41.000 --> 33:41.917
HUH?

33:41.917 --> 33:43.208
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY
GOT SOMETHING

33:43.208 --> 33:45.875
THAT MAKES BOYS
IN EMOTIONAL TURMOIL
JUST FLOCK TO HER.

33:45.875 --> 33:46.792
COME AGAIN.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.125
OH, COME ON.
DAWSON'S THE SAME WAY.

33:49.125 --> 33:51.000
WHATEVER SMALL PROBLEM
GOT TO HIM,

33:51.000 --> 33:53.333
HE WENT STRAIGHT
TO JOEY.

33:53.333 --> 33:55.375
SO WHO ELSE WOULD YOU
HAVE ME TALK TO?

33:55.375 --> 33:59.000
I CAN'T EXACTLY GO TO ANDIE
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

33:59.000 --> 34:00.250
SO I GUESS I'M SUPPOSED TO
COMMUNE WITH DEPUTY DOUG, THEN.

34:00.250 --> 34:03.667
DAWSON. WHY COULDN'T YOU
JUST GO TO DAWSON?

34:03.667 --> 34:04.917
[CHUCKLES]

34:04.917 --> 34:06.125
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU NOW FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE

34:06.125 --> 34:09.000
TALKING TO HIM
ABOUT YOUR SEX LIFE,
CONSIDERING...

34:09.000 --> 34:11.250
CONSIDERING WHAT?

34:11.250 --> 34:14.417
YOUR CURRENT GIRL FRIDAY
USED TO BE HIS.

34:14.417 --> 34:17.375
OK, NOW CORRECT ME
IF I'M WRONG,

34:17.375 --> 34:18.875
BUT DAWSON LEERY
DIDN'T ACTUALLY
KNOW ABOUT YOU AND I

34:18.875 --> 34:21.250
UNTIL WHAT,
2 MINUTES AGO?

34:21.250 --> 34:22.417
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT US.

34:22.417 --> 34:27.000
WHAT, JOEY? THIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH JOEY.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.375
I SAW THE WAY THAT YOU
OVERREACTED TO DAWSON.

34:29.375 --> 34:30.625
I SAW THE WAY THAT JOEY
OVERREACTED TO US.

34:30.625 --> 34:34.041
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE HAVING
TROUBLE IN MATH THESE DAYS,

34:34.041 --> 34:35.958
BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE EINSTEIN
TO GET THE SUM TOTAL

34:35.958 --> 34:37.792
OF THESE 2 OVERREACTIONS.

34:37.792 --> 34:38.917
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO EXPLAIN THIS ONE TO ME

34:38.917 --> 34:40.208
BECAUSE I GOTTA BE
MISSING SOMETHING HERE.

34:40.208 --> 34:42.208
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
JOEY POTTER, RIGHT?

34:42.208 --> 34:44.875
THE ONE WHO CAN'T WALK
INTO THE SAME ROOM WITH ME
WITHOUT GAGGING?

34:44.875 --> 34:46.708
HUH? THAT JOEY POTTER?

34:46.708 --> 34:48.667
THERE WAS NOTHING GOING ON
BETWEEN US--

34:48.667 --> 34:50.208
NO, PACEY, THERE'S
NOTHING BETWEEN US.

34:52.750 --> 34:56.250
NO MATTER WHAT WE DO,
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT
BETWEEN US.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.959
NO, IT'S NOT, IS IT?

35:02.959 --> 35:04.417
NO.

35:07.542 --> 35:09.208
ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED?

35:12.125 --> 35:14.875
YEAH, I'M DISAPPOINTED.

35:17.625 --> 35:20.166
AND AT THE SAME TIME...

35:21.250 --> 35:24.083
I THINK I'M ALSO
A LITTLE RELIEVED.

35:27.417 --> 35:28.583
ME, TOO.

35:30.750 --> 35:34.166
I'M GONNA GO.

35:34.959 --> 35:36.625
SEE YA, PACE.

35:47.333 --> 35:49.291
YOU KNOW WHAT, PACEY?

35:52.041 --> 35:53.917
THANKS FOR NOTHING.

36:09.208 --> 36:11.250
WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

36:11.250 --> 36:15.000
ANXIOUSLY AWAITING
TO BE REGALED WITH
FIRST-DATE STORIES.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.166
WELL, THEY TELL ME IN ORDER
TO HAVE FIRST-DATE STORIES,

36:18.166 --> 36:20.500
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE
A FIRST DATE.

36:20.500 --> 36:21.625
WHAT HAPPENED?

36:21.625 --> 36:22.875
I CAN'T GET INTO THIS
WITH YOU.

36:22.875 --> 36:23.875
YOU'RE JUST GONNA GET ON ME
ABOUT HOW I HANDLED IT.

36:23.875 --> 36:26.500
JACK, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.125
YOU'RE ALWAYS THE ONE
WHO'S SCRAPING ME OFF
THE CONCRETE.

36:29.125 --> 36:31.583
CAN'T I RETURN THE FAVOR?

36:35.166 --> 36:37.041
I DIDN'T EVEN GO IN, OK?

36:37.834 --> 36:40.834
I PANICKED.

36:44.458 --> 36:48.542
I GOT THERE,
LOOKED THROUGH
THE WINDOW,

36:48.542 --> 36:50.291
AND I SAW HIM SITTING THERE
WAITING FOR ME.

36:54.375 --> 36:57.208
THEN I SAW THIS COUPLE.

36:57.208 --> 36:59.375
THIS GIRL AND THIS GUY.

36:59.375 --> 37:01.250
AND WHEN I SAW THEM,
IT...

37:06.959 --> 37:10.291
WHEN I SAW THEM AT THAT MOMENT,
I DIDN'T WANNA BE ME.

37:14.166 --> 37:16.166
I WANTED TO BE THEM.

37:19.375 --> 37:22.792
I GOT SO UPSET
THAT I JUST LEFT.

37:26.166 --> 37:28.375
SO I GUESS WHEN IT
COMES RIGHT DOWN TO IT,

37:28.375 --> 37:30.375
I'M JUST NOT BRAVE ENOUGH
TO WALK THROUGH THE DOOR.

37:30.375 --> 37:32.750
OH, JACK,
YOU ARE SO BRAVE.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.667
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE,
YOU HAVE BEEN
NOTHING BUT BRAVE.

37:35.667 --> 37:37.166
BUT NOT THIS TIME.

37:37.166 --> 37:39.417
I MEAN, I KEEP TAKING
THESE BABY STEPS,

37:39.417 --> 37:41.250
BUT I'M NOT GETTING ANYWHERE.
I'M NOT GETTING ANY BRAVER.

37:41.250 --> 37:44.083
DON'T BE SO HARD
ON YOURSELF.

37:44.083 --> 37:46.333
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT
FEAR IS FOR.

37:46.333 --> 37:48.417
IT'S--IT'S LIFE'S WAY
OF TELLING US

37:48.417 --> 37:51.750
THAT WE'RE NOT READY
FOR CERTAIN THINGS.

37:51.750 --> 37:53.166
AREN'T YOU THE SAME GIRL
WHO SPENT THE PAST WEEK

37:53.166 --> 37:57.333
DRAGGING ME KICKING
AND SCREAMING TOWARDS
MY ROMANTIC DESTINY?

37:57.333 --> 38:00.250
YEAH, BUT I KNOW WHEN
TO PUSH AND WHEN NOT TO.

38:00.250 --> 38:02.083
IT'S A LITTLE SOMETHING
I PICKED UP

38:02.083 --> 38:04.959
FROM ANNOYINGSISTER.COM.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.500
ANYWAY, JACK,

38:08.500 --> 38:11.041
WHEN IT'S RIGHT,
YOU'LL KNOW IT.

38:11.041 --> 38:14.083
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL
WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR.

38:14.083 --> 38:16.291
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

38:18.208 --> 38:20.792
IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

38:20.792 --> 38:22.542
WHAT HAPPENED
WAS INEVITABLE.

38:22.542 --> 38:23.667
WHAT WAS?

38:23.667 --> 38:24.917
WHAT WE JUST SAW.

38:24.917 --> 38:28.917
LOOK AT IT FROM
A STORYTELLING
PERSPECTIVE.

38:28.917 --> 38:31.792
PACEY'S BROODING,
DISILLUSIONED,
TOUGH-GUY PERSONA

38:31.792 --> 38:36.000
WAS DESTINED
TO COLLIDE WITH JEN'S
FAKE SEXUAL BRAVADO.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.750
IT WAS INEVITABLE.

38:38.750 --> 38:41.333
DAWSON, YOU'RE
THE ULTIMATE ROMANTIC.

38:41.333 --> 38:44.291
HOW CAN YOU NOT
BE MORE UPSET ABOUT HIS?

38:44.291 --> 38:48.667
IF JEN AND PACEY WANNA
MESS AROUND IN A COAT ROOM,
THAT'S THEIR BUSINESS.

38:48.667 --> 38:51.166
BUT, DAWSON,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON.

38:51.166 --> 38:52.959
THEY MADE SOME SORT
OF CASUAL-SEX PACT.

38:52.959 --> 38:54.708
THEY'RE JUST
USING EACH OTHER.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.291
WE'RE ALL GUILTY
OF THAT.

38:56.291 --> 38:57.667
AT LEAST THEIR BEING
UP-FRONT ABOUT IT.

38:57.667 --> 39:00.583
SO YOU BUY INTO THIS WHOLE
RAGING HORMONES THEORY?

39:00.583 --> 39:03.875
YOU THINK IT'S OK
FOR 2 PEOPLE
WHO AREN'T IN LOVE

39:03.875 --> 39:06.291
TO JUST LET THEIR
SEXUAL IMPULSES
RUN WILD?

39:06.291 --> 39:09.333
NO. WHAT I'M SAYING IS
IF JEN AND PACEY MADE
SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT,

39:09.333 --> 39:11.125
I DON'T THINK THEY MADE IT
BECAUSE THEY WANTED SEX.

39:11.125 --> 39:14.000
I THINK THEY WANTED COMFORT.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.375
I'M SURE THAT'S
ALL THEY WERE DOING
IN YOUR BED, DAWSON,

39:15.375 --> 39:17.125
PROVIDING EACH OTHER
WITH COMFORT.

39:17.125 --> 39:19.166
IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

39:19.166 --> 39:21.458
IT'S ALL YOU AND I
EVER DID.

39:24.458 --> 39:26.959
GIVE 'EM A BREAK,
JO.

39:26.959 --> 39:28.208
THEY'RE JUST LONELY.

39:29.667 --> 39:32.625
DAWSON, BEING LONELY
IS NO EXCUSE TO JUST
THROW YOURSELF

39:32.625 --> 39:34.458
AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE
WARM BODY.

39:34.458 --> 39:36.959
COULD YOU SLEEP WITH SOMEONE
THAT YOU DIDN'T LOVE?

39:36.959 --> 39:40.208
NO, AND NEITHER
COULD YOU.

39:40.208 --> 39:42.875
BUT I DO UNDERSTAND
THE IMPULSE.

39:42.875 --> 39:44.041
WHAT IMPULSE?

39:44.041 --> 39:46.708
IMPULSE TO...

39:46.708 --> 39:50.542
TO PUT YOUR HAND OUT
AND WANT SOMEONE THERE
AT THE END OF YOUR REACH.

39:50.542 --> 39:55.125
TO WANT SOMEONE TO BE CLOSE
TO WANNA KISS OR TOUCH,
EVEN IF IT'S WRONG.

39:55.125 --> 39:56.708
THAT'S JUST IT, DAWSON.

39:56.708 --> 39:57.917
IT'S WRONG.

39:57.917 --> 40:01.708
IF A KISS IS JUST SOME
PURELY PHYSICAL THING,

40:01.708 --> 40:03.625
AND IF THERE'S
NOTHING ELSE BEHIND IT,
WHAT'S THE POINT?

40:03.625 --> 40:06.834
THE POINT IS YOU CAN'T
CONTROL THOSE FEELINGS, JO.

40:06.834 --> 40:08.625
EVEN IF THEY'RE WRONG,
THEY'RE THERE.

40:08.625 --> 40:12.125
THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE.

40:12.125 --> 40:13.500
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT,
CAN'T YOU?

40:19.708 --> 40:21.083
I FORGOT MY COAT.

40:21.083 --> 40:24.083
I--I BETTER GO INSIDE
AND GET IT.

40:24.083 --> 40:24.750
OK.

40:27.917 --> 40:29.417
GOOD NIGHT.

40:31.750 --> 40:33.250
GOOD NIGHT, JOEY.

41:08.375 --> 41:10.917
I FORGOT MY COAT.

41:10.917 --> 41:13.792
WELL, YEAH, YOU RAN OUT OF THERE
IN A BIT OF A HURRY, DIDN'T YA?

41:17.333 --> 41:19.375
LOOK, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

41:19.375 --> 41:21.166
WE NEVER ACTUALLY
SLEPT TOGETHER.

41:21.166 --> 41:24.458
I MEAN, NOT EVEN CLOSE.

41:24.458 --> 41:26.667
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS
WHAT YOU GUYS DID
OR DIDN'T DO.

41:28.291 --> 41:31.625
I'M SORRY I OVERREACTED.

41:31.625 --> 41:34.500
YEAH, YOU DID OVERREACT,
DIDN'T YOU?

41:34.500 --> 41:36.834
DON'T ACT SO SMUG.
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU'RE RIGHT

41:36.834 --> 41:39.750
OR THAT I APPROVE
OF WHAT YOU GUYS
ARE DOING.

41:39.750 --> 41:42.375
WERE DOING.
I'D SAY THE TIME LIMIT
ON THE LIMITED-TIME OFFER

41:42.375 --> 41:45.000
HAS PROBABLY RUN OUT NOW.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.834
OH.

41:48.208 --> 41:51.750
SO YOU GOT YOUR COAT.

41:51.750 --> 41:54.375
WHAT MADE YOU COME IN HERE?

41:54.375 --> 41:55.834
DAWSON.

41:55.834 --> 41:58.000
HE CONVINCED ME
TO TAKE PITY

41:58.000 --> 42:00.834
ON YOUR POOR, MISGUIDED,
TESTOSTERONE-IMPAIRED
SELF.

42:00.834 --> 42:03.333
HEH HEH. HE DID THAT,
DID HE?

42:03.333 --> 42:04.667
'FRAID SO.

42:04.667 --> 42:07.166
MAN, I GUESS I OWE HIM
ANOTHER ONE, HUH?

42:07.166 --> 42:08.667
YOU DO.

42:08.667 --> 42:12.125
COME ON, LET'S GO.

42:13.917 --> 42:18.250
HEY, NOT SO FAST, YOU TWO.
THERE'S A CLASS ABOUT TO START.

42:18.250 --> 42:22.000
I THINK WE'VE DONE ENOUGH
DANCING FOR A LIFETIME.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.208
WHOA, WHOA. LET'S NOT
BE TOO HASTY HERE.

42:23.208 --> 42:26.166
WE'VE STILL
GOT A SCHOLARSHIP
TO WORK FOR, RIGHT?

42:26.166 --> 42:28.792
OH, UM, ABOUT
THAT SCHOLARSHIP--

42:28.792 --> 42:31.375
THINGS HAVE BEEN KIND OF TIGHT
HERE AT THE STARLIGHT.

42:31.375 --> 42:34.583
THERE'S NO SCHOLARSHIP?

42:35.583 --> 42:37.959
NO. BUT WHAT I CAN OFFER YOU

42:37.959 --> 42:40.458
IS 6 MONTHS
OF FREE DANCE LESSONS.

42:40.458 --> 42:42.250
AND WHAT WOULD
WE DO WITH THOSE?

42:42.250 --> 42:44.708
THE CHA-CHA, THE RUMBA,
THE MERENGUE.

42:44.708 --> 42:45.375
UM, WHEN YOU'RE READY,
THE TANGO.

42:45.375 --> 42:48.375
IT'S THE DANCE OF LOVE.

42:48.375 --> 42:50.333
THANKS, BUT NO, THANKS.

42:50.333 --> 42:52.333
COME ON, THINK ABOUT
THIS FOR A SECOND.

42:52.333 --> 42:53.792
DON'T BE TOO HASTY.

42:53.792 --> 42:56.708
WE MAY HAVE
FOUND OUR CALLING
IN THIS DANCE STUDIO.

42:56.708 --> 43:00.959
GIVE IT UP, PACEY.
YOU DEFINITELY
WERE NOT THAT GOOD.
