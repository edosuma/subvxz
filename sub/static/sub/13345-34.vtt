WEBVTT

00:07.608 --> 00:10.544
Woman:
I CAME HOME FROM WORK
A LITTLE LATE,

00:10.644 --> 00:12.513
BUT I BROUGHT DINNER--

00:12.613 --> 00:14.515
VEGETARIAN--

00:14.615 --> 00:16.384
AND SHE WASN'T THERE.

00:16.484 --> 00:19.487
ONCE AGAIN, ANITA,
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

00:19.587 --> 00:21.922
THAT YOU GOT SO CAUGHT UP
IN YOUR WORK LIFE

00:22.022 --> 00:26.194
THAT ELAINE COULDN'T HELP
BUT FEEL EXCLUDED.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.229
- AND, ELAINE...
- ( knock on door )

00:28.329 --> 00:30.431
...THE MOMENT THAT
YOU FELT SHUNTED ASIDE,

00:30.531 --> 00:33.301
YOU RAN BACK
TO YOUR FAMILY.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.203
EXACTLY.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.605
IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE KIND OF
LOCKED IN THIS CYCLE

00:37.705 --> 00:40.541
- THAT'S VERY DIFF--
- ( knocks on door )

00:40.641 --> 00:43.777
- HELLO, PAUL.
- WALTER, YOU'RE A LITTLE EARLY,

00:43.877 --> 00:45.146
AND WE'RE STILL
IN SESSION.

00:45.246 --> 00:48.216
OH, JEEZ.
I'M SORRY.

00:48.316 --> 00:49.883
I-- I'LL COME BACK.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.619
THANK YOU.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.958
SO-- I'M SORRY,
WHERE WERE WE?

00:58.058 --> 00:59.827
LOCKED IN A CYCLE.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.098
( theme music playing )

01:22.316 --> 01:24.418
I'M SORRY
ABOUT EARLIER.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.754
IT HAPPENS.

01:26.854 --> 01:30.224
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MANY
FELLOW PATIENTS THERE WERE.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.493
YOU'RE BUSY ALL THE TIME,
AREN'T YOU?

01:34.228 --> 01:38.732
SO THEY FINALLY RELEASED ME
MONDAY AFTERNOON.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.502
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.841
CONNIE AND NATALIE
PICKED ME UP.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.211
WE HEADED STRAIGHT OUT
FOR THE BAY.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.213
I HAVE
A FEW SHACKS THERE--

01:52.313 --> 01:55.082
THAT CONNIE LIKES
TO CALL A COMPOUND--

01:55.183 --> 01:57.951
ON SHELTER ISLAND.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.388
WE DROVE UP--
A WARM DAY,

02:00.488 --> 02:03.791
FIRST SOUTHERLY WIND
OF THE NEW YEAR.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.959
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY
ON MONDAY.

02:06.059 --> 02:10.498
IT'S AMAZING WHEN
THE COLD FINALLY BREAKS.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.733
OH, EVERYTHING WAS
SO MUDDY, THOUGH.

02:12.833 --> 02:17.371
THEY'RE A FEW WEEKS
BEHIND THE CITY WEATHERWISE.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.007
THE SNOW HAD JUST MELTED

02:20.107 --> 02:23.110
AND THE GROUND
WAS JUST SOAKED.

02:23.211 --> 02:27.881
I IMAGINE IT FELT GOOD
TO BE OUTSIDE,

02:27.981 --> 02:31.352
ESPECIALLY AFTER
THE LAST FEW WEEKS.

02:31.452 --> 02:34.722
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

02:34.822 --> 02:38.292
BUT... IT DIDN'T?

02:38.392 --> 02:41.028
WELL, NO,
THE AIR FELT GREAT.

02:41.128 --> 02:45.165
IT'S JUST THAT
CONNIE AND NATALIE--

02:45.266 --> 02:47.568
THEY WERE JUST SO...

02:47.668 --> 02:49.737
TENTATIVE WITH ME.

02:49.837 --> 02:53.507
THERE'S A SEPARATE STUDIO
NEAR THE MAIN HOUSE

02:53.607 --> 02:55.843
THAT I'VE USED
AS AN OFFICE SOMETIMES,

02:55.943 --> 02:57.811
OR SOMETIMES JUST TO--

02:57.911 --> 03:01.682
FOR A LITTLE PEACE AND QUIET
WHEN THE KIDS WERE YOUNGER.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.818
I WANTED TO GO THERE
BUT THEY KEPT ASKING ME WHY.

03:04.918 --> 03:09.623
WAS THERE ANYTHING YOU NEEDED
TO DO IN YOUR OFFICE?

03:09.723 --> 03:12.260
WELL, TAKE CARE
OF SOME BILLS.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.195
BUT MOSTLY I JUST WANTED
TO BE BY MYSELF.

03:15.296 --> 03:18.266
I JUST WANTED TO HAVE
A LITTLE PEACE.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.200
THAT'S UNUSUAL FOR YOU.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.336
WELL, CONNIE'S A TALKER--

03:22.436 --> 03:24.204
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
A TALKER--

03:24.305 --> 03:26.206
AND I GUESS
OVER THE YEARS

03:26.307 --> 03:28.276
I'VE LEARNED
HOW TO TUNE IT OUT.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.044
BUT THIS TIME
YOU DIDN'T.

03:31.144 --> 03:34.282
WELL, SOMETHING
ABOUT HER PITCH--
IT JUST BOTHERED ME.

03:34.382 --> 03:37.485
SO I WENT
TO THE OFFICE,

03:37.585 --> 03:39.920
AND A FEW MINUTES LATER
I LOOKED UP

03:40.020 --> 03:42.623
AND THERE'S NATALIE

03:42.723 --> 03:45.025
SPYING ON ME FROM HER
BEDROOM WINDOW.

03:45.125 --> 03:48.128
SHE'S STILL ON DUTY.

03:48.228 --> 03:52.266
YEAH, LIKE I WAS A LITTLE BOY
THAT SOMEONE HAD TO BABYSIT.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.435
YOU TOLD ME ONCE

03:54.535 --> 03:57.305
THAT WHEN YOU WERE
A LITTLE BOY YOURSELF,

03:57.405 --> 04:02.175
YOU WERE THE ONE ON DUTY
WITH YOUR PARENTS.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.977
OH, I DIDN'T DO
THAT MUCH,

04:04.077 --> 04:05.679
JUST KEPT AN EYE
ON THINGS.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.748
REALLY IT'S NOTHING EVEN
WORTH TALKING ABOUT.

04:07.848 --> 04:11.151
SO WHAT DID YOU DO
WHEN YOU SAW NATALIE

04:11.251 --> 04:13.587
KEEPING AN EYE ON YOU?

04:13.687 --> 04:15.923
I GLARED.

04:16.023 --> 04:19.026
THEN ABOUT 10 MINUTES LATER
SHE BROUGHT ME SOME TEA

04:19.126 --> 04:21.529
WHICH I HADN'T ASKED FOR.

04:21.629 --> 04:24.264
AND SHE ASKED IF SHE COULD
JUST SIT WITH ME.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.499
AND HOW WAS THAT?

04:25.599 --> 04:28.035
BRIEF.
SHE'S MY DAUGHTER.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.770
I DON'T GO TO HER
WITH MY PROBLEMS.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.205
YOU HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER, THOUGH.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.241
YOU WROTE TO HER
ALMOST EVERY DAY

04:34.342 --> 04:36.276
WHEN SHE WAS IN RWANDA.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.446
I IMAGINE
SHE'D WORRY LESS

04:38.546 --> 04:41.048
IF YOU TALKED TO HER
A LITTLE BIT MORE

04:41.148 --> 04:43.684
ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN
GOING ON WITH YOU.

04:43.784 --> 04:47.087
WELL, I JUST DIDN'T
FEEL LIKE TALKING.

04:47.187 --> 04:49.056
SO I WENT TO THE SHED

04:49.156 --> 04:51.058
AND GOT THIS IMMENSE
PAIR OF CLIPPERS

04:51.158 --> 04:53.594
AND, OH, I STARTED
HACKING AWAY

04:53.694 --> 04:56.430
AT THE BRUSH
DOWN BY THE WATER,

04:56.530 --> 05:00.200
LIMBING THE TREES
AND PARING DOWN THE BUSHES.

05:00.300 --> 05:05.038
GOD, TORE MY HANDS UP
SOMETHING TERRIBLE.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.175
ALL THAT BRUSH-CLEARING--

05:08.275 --> 05:10.143
IT'S KIND OF LIKE

05:10.243 --> 05:12.780
WHAT WE'VE BEEN
DOING IN HERE.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.249
YOU LOST ME ON THAT ONE.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.251
IN THE SENSE
THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING

05:18.352 --> 05:21.188
ON CLEARING PATHS,
OPENING UP YOUR VIEW

05:21.288 --> 05:24.492
OF HOW YOU GOT
TO WHERE YOU ARE.

05:24.592 --> 05:27.628
SO WHEN YOU MENTIONED
THIS WEEK'S THAW,

05:27.728 --> 05:31.532
IT MADE ME THINK OF THE WAY
OUR LAST SESSION ENDED.

05:33.667 --> 05:37.471
YOU KNOW,
BETWEEN THE PILLS

05:37.571 --> 05:39.873
AND THE THERAPISTS
I SAW AT THE HOSPITAL,

05:39.973 --> 05:42.643
I'M NOT SURE I EVEN
REMEMBER THAT ONE.

05:42.743 --> 05:45.212
YOU REALLY DON'T REMEMBER?

05:45.312 --> 05:48.716
I FIND THAT STRIKING,

05:48.816 --> 05:51.284
GIVEN HOW EMOTIONAL
A MOMENT THAT WAS.

05:51.385 --> 05:54.455
WELL, I KNOW
WE TALKED ABOUT

05:54.555 --> 05:56.657
GETTING ME OUT
OF THE CUCKOO'S NEST.

05:56.757 --> 06:00.561
AND I SHOWED YOU
MY POT HOLDER.

06:00.661 --> 06:04.765
THEN I GOT ANGRY ABOUT YOU
BRINGING UP CONNIE'S REHAB.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.568
I MEANT AFTER THAT,

06:07.668 --> 06:09.570
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT
THE TWO WALTERS--

06:09.670 --> 06:12.640
THE ONE WHO YOU KNEW
AND THE ONE YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.442
OH, YEAH.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.610
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.812
YOU SEEMED QUITE MOVED

06:18.912 --> 06:22.483
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT
RECONNECTING TO THE LOST WALTER.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.853
WELL, I MIGHT HAVE
TEARED UP A BIT,

06:25.953 --> 06:28.456
BUT I WAS TIRED

06:28.556 --> 06:31.525
AND THERE'S BEEN
A LOT OF STRESS.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.294
I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT MY MEMORY IS

06:34.394 --> 06:36.964
THAT YOU DIDN'T
JUST TEAR UP.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.500
YOU WERE ACTUALLY SOBBING.

06:41.702 --> 06:45.839
WHAT IS IT, WALTER?
WHERE DID YOU GO?

06:45.939 --> 06:48.576
I JUST REMEMBERED
A DREAM I HAD THIS WEEK.

06:50.043 --> 06:53.747
MR. DONALDSON CALLED ME IN
FOR A MEETING.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.916
ONLY IT WASN'T
IN AN OFFICE.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.152
IT WAS--

07:00.353 --> 07:02.956
IT WAS IN AN OLD GARAGE.

07:04.191 --> 07:07.661
I WENT IN,
WE SHOOK HANDS

07:07.761 --> 07:12.566
AND HE TOLD ME
THEY'D TRACED

07:12.666 --> 07:15.335
THE SOURCE
OF THE CONTAMINATION

07:15.435 --> 07:17.738
AND THAT IT WASN'T
ANYTHING WE'D DONE WRONG.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.474
SOME NUT JOB

07:20.574 --> 07:23.176
DELIBERATELY TAMPERING
WITH THE PRODUCT

07:23.276 --> 07:25.946
AND THEN PUTTING IT
BACK ON SHELF.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.381
GO ON.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.518
I FELT VINDICATED.

07:30.618 --> 07:34.655
AND THEN THE OLD MAN DID
SOMETHING HE NEVER DID--

07:36.223 --> 07:38.025
HE APOLOGIZED.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.730
HE SAID THAT
LETTING GO OF ME

07:43.897 --> 07:46.767
WAS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
HE'D EVER MADE,

07:46.867 --> 07:49.436
THAT HE WANTED ME
TO TAKE MY OLD JOB BACK.

07:49.537 --> 07:52.105
YOU'D BE WALTER BARNETT,
C.E.O., AGAIN.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.977
I TRIED TO ANSWER,

07:57.077 --> 07:58.779
BUT I COULDN'T SPEAK.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.181
I--

08:03.450 --> 08:05.553
I OPENED MY MOUTH,

08:06.620 --> 08:08.989
BUT I COULDN'T
GET ANY WORDS OUT.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.126
I WOKE UP IN A SWEAT.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.095
I KEPT TRYING

08:15.195 --> 08:17.798
TO DIVE BACK INTO THE DREAM,
BUT I COULDN'T GET THERE.

08:17.898 --> 08:21.368
YOU WANTED TO FINISH
THE CONVERSATION?

08:21.468 --> 08:24.404
WHAT DID YOU MAKE
OF THAT DREAM?

08:24.504 --> 08:26.406
WELL, I GUESS
I STILL WANT TO THINK

08:26.506 --> 08:30.177
THE WHOLE MESS
NEVER HAPPENED.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.012
I WANT MY OLD LIFE BACK.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.114
DO YOU?

08:34.214 --> 08:37.450
BECAUSE YOU SAID
YOU COULDN'T GET ANY WORDS OUT.

08:37.551 --> 08:40.353
IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT YOU WEREN'T SURE

08:40.453 --> 08:42.255
IF YOU WANTED TO GO BACK?

08:44.825 --> 08:48.428
NO, PROBABLY JUST
BARGAINING.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.431
COULD BE.
OR PERHAPS NOW

08:51.531 --> 08:53.533
WITH A LITTLE DISTANCE
YOU HAVE A GREATER SENSE

08:53.634 --> 08:56.536
OF THE ENORMOUS STRAIN
YOU'VE BEEN UNDER FOR SO LONG.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.072
IT NEVER USED TO FEEL
LIKE A STRAIN.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.708
THAT'S RIGHT.

09:00.808 --> 09:03.343
I THINK YOU GENUINELY
DIDN'T FEEL IT.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.345
YOU'VE BECOME
EXCEPTIONALLY ADEPT

09:05.445 --> 09:07.080
AT OVERRIDING
YOUR FEELINGS.

09:07.180 --> 09:10.517
THAT'S WHAT WE WERE BEGINNING
TO TALK ABOUT LAST WEEK.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.185
DO YOU REMEMBER?

09:13.987 --> 09:16.556
RIGHT,

09:16.657 --> 09:21.094
HOW THE WEAK WALTER
COULDN'T HANDLE THE STRESS.

09:21.194 --> 09:25.198
DID YOU THINK ABOUT
THAT WALTER THIS WEEK?

09:25.298 --> 09:29.002
THE LOST BOY?

09:29.102 --> 09:31.238
NO, NOT REALLY.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.111
YOU DID MAKE ME THINK
ABOUT MY FATHER.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.246
YOUR FATHER?

09:39.346 --> 09:42.549
HOW DID I DO THAT?

09:42.650 --> 09:45.218
JUST BEFORE,
WHEN I CAME EARLY

09:45.318 --> 09:47.354
AND I WALKED IN ON YOU,

09:47.454 --> 09:50.691
YOU JUST HAD A LOOK
ON YOUR FACE

09:50.791 --> 09:52.492
THAT REMINDED ME OF HIM.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.295
TER TOMMY--
- IN WHAT WAY?
- A

09:55.395 --> 09:57.898
AFTER THE ACCIDENT,

09:57.998 --> 10:03.070
HE COULDN'T SLEEP
NIGHTS ANYMORE.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.672
INSOMNIA?

10:04.772 --> 10:08.008
YEAH, AND HE STARTED

10:08.108 --> 10:10.878
TO WORK
THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT.

10:10.978 --> 10:14.648
AND WHEN HE'D COME HOME
FROM THE FACTORY,

10:14.748 --> 10:16.583
HE DIDN'T WANT
TO WAKE UP MY MOTHER,

10:16.684 --> 10:19.452
SO HE'D GO TO SLEEP
ON THE COUCH.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.621
AND I'D COME DOWNSTAIRS

10:21.722 --> 10:23.623
AND I'D WANT TO TALK
TO HIM, YOU KNOW,

10:23.724 --> 10:27.627
ABOUT-- I DON'T KNOW--
THE DAY BEFORE,

10:27.728 --> 10:29.629
WHAT HAPPENED AT SCHOOL.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.399
AND THERE WAS THAT LOOK.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.202
CAN YOU DESCRIBE IT?

10:41.141 --> 10:43.711
"HOW THE HELL
DO I GET RID OF YOU

10:43.811 --> 10:46.413
WITHOUT MAKING YOU
FEEL BAD?"

10:46.513 --> 10:49.349
COME ON, LISTEN,
IT'S OKAY.

10:49.449 --> 10:52.052
REALLY, YOU WERE BUSY.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.487
IF IT HAD BEEN MY SESSION
AND SOMEBODY WALKED IN,

10:54.587 --> 10:56.223
I WOULD HAVE BEEN
PISSED OFF.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.159
STILL, YOU FELT REJECTED,

10:59.259 --> 11:00.694
EVEN ABANDONED.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.163
NO, I WAS EARLY.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.664
RIGHT, THE SAME WAY

11:04.765 --> 11:06.700
YOU WERE TOO EARLY
FOR YOUR DAD.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.501
WORK COMES FIRST.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.170
THAT'S LIFE.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.441
MY MOTHER DIDN'T SEE
MUCH OF HIM EITHER.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.310
SHE GOT USED TO IT.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.647
SHE'D COME HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL--

11:20.748 --> 11:22.750
SHE WAS A NURSE--

11:25.552 --> 11:27.988
AND I'D FIX HER
AN OLD-FASHIONED.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.290
WE'D EAT.

11:30.390 --> 11:33.994
I'D FIX HER ANOTHER.

11:34.094 --> 11:38.198
I HAD TO GET THE CHERRY AND
THE ORANGE WEDGE JUST RIGHT.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.433
THEN SHE'D GO
IN HER BEDROOM.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.004
I WAS ALWAYS NERVOUS

11:45.238 --> 11:46.106
THAT SHE'D FALL ASLEEP

11:46.206 --> 11:48.341
WHILE SHE WAS
SMOKING IN BED,

11:48.441 --> 11:51.211
SO I'D CHECK IN ON HER

11:51.311 --> 11:53.246
AND MAKE SURE
ALL THE ASHTRAYS WERE OUT.

11:53.346 --> 11:56.249
THAT'S A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY
FOR A YOUNG BOY.

11:56.349 --> 11:59.186
OH, LISTEN, THEY WERE--

11:59.286 --> 12:01.254
YOU CAN'T BLAME HER--

12:01.354 --> 12:03.290
EITHER OF THEM.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.258
THEIR LIVES WERE RUINED.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.527
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANY NEED TO BLAME THEM

12:07.627 --> 12:12.099
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND
YOUR LONELINESS.

12:12.199 --> 12:15.936
THEY WERE TOO GRIEF-STRICKEN
TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

12:16.036 --> 12:19.739
I HAD TO PUT AWAY
MY CHILDISH THINGS.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.775
ACTUALLY, I THINK
THE VERSE IS,

12:21.875 --> 12:25.445
"WHEN I BECAME A MAN,
I PUT AWAY CHILDISH THINGS."

12:25.545 --> 12:28.015
YOU WERE STILL A BOY.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.883
A LOT OF KIDS
HAD IT WORSE.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.119
DO YOU REMEMBER
ANY GOOD TIMES?

12:32.219 --> 12:35.688
DID THE THREE OF YOU
SPEND TIME TOGETHER?

12:35.789 --> 12:37.858
NOT SO MUCH.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.627
ON WEEKENDS HE WAS ALWAYS
TINKERING WITH HIS CAR.

12:40.727 --> 12:43.563
THAT THING WAS
A REAL MONEY PIT.

12:43.663 --> 12:45.598
DID YOU HAVE A GARAGE?

12:45.698 --> 12:48.601
OH, YEAH. I USED TO
PEEK IN ON HIM.

12:48.701 --> 12:49.970
AND HE DIDN'T LET YOU IN?

12:50.070 --> 12:51.604
AFTER A WHILE
I FIGURED OUT

12:51.704 --> 12:55.408
HOW TO STAND ON A GARBAGE CAN
AND LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.577
IT TURNED OUT,
MOST OF THE TIME

12:57.677 --> 12:59.712
HE WASN'T WORKING
ON THE CAR.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.950
HE WAS STARING

13:03.050 --> 13:07.587
AT A PICTURE OF TOMMY
ON THE WALL.

13:07.687 --> 13:11.424
ONE TIME HE SAW ME.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.760
IT WAS TERRIBLE.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.428
YOU WANTED
TO CONNECT WITH HIM,

13:15.528 --> 13:19.967
BUT YOU FELT
HE DIDN'T WANT YOU THERE.
IS THAT IT?

13:20.067 --> 13:23.937
THE BOYS USED TO SPY ON ME
THE SAME WAY

13:24.037 --> 13:28.108
WHEN I WORKED ON WEEKENDS.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.511
THEY'D WANT TO PLAY
OR GO SWIMMING,

13:31.611 --> 13:34.614
AND I ALWAYS HAD
WORK TO DO.

13:34.714 --> 13:38.351
I PROBABLY GAVE THEM
THE SAME LOOK.

13:38.451 --> 13:41.821
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO TALK ABOUT NOW.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.724
YOU KNOW, WALTER,
IT'S NOT TOO LATE FOR YOU
TO GET TO KNOW THEM

13:44.824 --> 13:46.726
AND FOR THEM
TO GET TO KNOW YOU.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.096
NO, I DON'T THINK
THEY'D BE INTERESTED.

13:49.196 --> 13:53.333
MAYBE THEY FEEL, I DON'T KNOW,
INTIMIDATED BY YOU,

13:53.433 --> 13:56.269
REPAIRING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN
WORK ON IN HERE.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.072
I SAID I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE INTERESTED.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.608
YOU WERE INTERESTED
IN TALKING TO YOUR FATHER

14:01.708 --> 14:04.011
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW
IN THAT GARAGE.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.546
IN FACT, YOU'RE STILL
DREAMING ABOUT IT.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.715
WE NEVER DISCUSSED IT.

14:08.815 --> 14:11.784
A FEW YEARS LATER
WE MOVED

14:11.885 --> 14:14.154
TO THE NEXT
COAL TOWN OVER.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.090
MY MOTHER
DIDN'T WANT TO GO,

14:17.190 --> 14:19.326
BUT MY FATHER THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE BETTER

14:19.426 --> 14:21.861
TO START OVER AGAIN
IN A NEW PLACE

14:21.962 --> 14:25.465
WITHOUT TOMMY'S PRESENCE
HOVERING OVER EVERYTHING.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.834
AND HOW DID YOU FEEL
ABOUT IT?

14:27.935 --> 14:30.137
THEY DIDN'T ASK ME.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.139
IT MUST BE HARD,
AS A CHILD,

14:32.239 --> 14:35.308
TO KNOW WHAT YOUR
FEELINGS ARE WHEN YOU'RE
NOT ASKED ABOUT THEM.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.845
YOU KNOW, FOR AWHILE THERE
AFTER WE MOVED,

14:38.946 --> 14:41.814
I'D RUN AWAY

14:41.915 --> 14:46.086
BACK TO THE OLD HOME.

14:46.186 --> 14:49.322
I'D GET ON MY BIKE
AND I'D JUST GO THERE,

14:49.422 --> 14:53.093
I DON'T KNOW, TO CHECK
IF TOMMY WAS WAITING FOR US.

14:53.193 --> 14:57.764
GO FIGURE OUT A CHILD.

14:57.864 --> 15:00.533
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
WHEN YOU VISITED?

15:00.633 --> 15:03.103
NOTHING.

15:03.203 --> 15:06.806
I'D JUST SIT THERE
FOR HOURS, WAITING.

15:06.906 --> 15:11.178
AND, WELL, HE NEVER
CAME BACK, OF COURSE.

15:11.278 --> 15:15.548
I WONDER IF MAYBE
YOU DIDN'T GO BACK

15:15.648 --> 15:18.318
JUST TO LOOK FOR TOMMY.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.787
MAYBE THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.990
WHO?

15:23.090 --> 15:26.393
THE BOY THAT YOU WERE
BEFORE TOMMY WAS KILLED.

15:29.162 --> 15:32.232
MAYBE THE OLD HOUSE
WAS THE ONLY PLACE

15:32.332 --> 15:35.368
YOU COULD LET YOURSELF
FEEL YOUR LOSSES

15:35.468 --> 15:37.137
AND FIND INTIMACY

15:37.237 --> 15:40.073
WITH SOMETHING
THAT WAS GONE--

15:41.241 --> 15:43.310
WITH YOUR DEAD BROTHER

15:44.877 --> 15:46.513
AND YOUR MEMORIES.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.783
THERE WAS NOTHING THERE
FOR YOU, WALTER,

15:50.883 --> 15:52.619
AND THERE WAS NOTHING
IN THE NEW HOME

15:52.719 --> 15:56.623
EXCEPT DUTY, LONELINESS.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.966
DON'T WORRY,

16:07.067 --> 16:10.370
I'M NOT GONNA CRY.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.473
I KNOW HOW UNCOMFORTABLE
THAT MADE YOU.

16:13.573 --> 16:17.377
IS THAT HOW YOU THOUGHT
I REACTED, WALTER,
TO LAST WEEK?

16:17.477 --> 16:18.945
OH, COME ON, PAUL.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.448
YOU DON'T NEED
TO PRETEND.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.917
I KNOW I'VE BEEN
A BASKET CASE IN HERE.

16:25.018 --> 16:28.121
I KNOW HOW THAT
DISGUSTED YOU.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.956
WHY WOULD
I FEEL LIKE THAT?

16:30.057 --> 16:33.160
I'M A GROWN MAN.

16:33.260 --> 16:37.897
I'M NOT A SIX-YEAR-OLD.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.667
AND MEN DON'T CRY.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.435
MAYBE THEY DO NOW.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.072
BUT WHEN I BECAME A MAN,
THEY DIDN'T.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.074
WAS THAT WHAT YOUR FATHER
TAUGHT YOU?

16:47.174 --> 16:49.109
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO.
WHERE I GREW UP,

16:49.209 --> 16:50.943
A BOY WOULDN'T BE
CAUGHT DEAD CRYING.

16:51.044 --> 16:54.714
HOW ABOUT WHEN TOMMY DIED?
DID YOU CRY THEN?

16:54.814 --> 16:57.250
I WAS UPSET.

16:57.350 --> 17:01.288
I KNEW IT WAS MY FAULT.

17:01.388 --> 17:04.524
MAYBE I STARTED
TO TREMBLE.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.826
MAYBE I STARTED TO CRY.

17:06.926 --> 17:09.362
YEAH YEAH.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.364
BECAUSE THE OLD MAN,
I REMEMBER,

17:11.464 --> 17:15.702
PICKED ME UP
AND SHOOK ME HARD.

17:15.802 --> 17:19.239
"DON'T YOU DARE,"
HE SAID,

17:19.339 --> 17:21.374
"IN FRONT OF YOUR MOTHER.

17:21.474 --> 17:26.546
( emphatically )
DON'T YOU EVER."

17:40.360 --> 17:43.796
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S WHEN YOU STARTED

17:43.896 --> 17:48.268
TO MAYBE SHUT DOWN
A LITTLE?

17:48.368 --> 17:52.139
YOU MEAN THAT
OTHER WALTER OF YOURS?

17:52.239 --> 17:54.474
MAYBE IT'S NOT REALLY FAIR
TO CALL HIM

17:54.574 --> 17:58.145
"THE OTHER WALTER."

17:58.245 --> 18:00.180
THE TRUTH IS,
HE'S A PART OF YOU--

18:00.280 --> 18:02.915
A PART OF YOU THAT WAS
SPLIT OFF AND NEGLECTED

18:03.015 --> 18:06.018
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

18:06.119 --> 18:09.055
I WAS DOING FINE
WITHOUT HIM

18:09.156 --> 18:11.090
ALL THIS TIME,
WASN'T I?

18:11.191 --> 18:12.659
YOU DID MORE THAN FINE.

18:12.759 --> 18:16.095
YOU ACCOMPLISHED GREAT THINGS
IN YOUR LIFE, WALTER.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.831
SO WHY IS THIS SPLIT
A BAD THING?

18:18.931 --> 18:21.768
WELL, IT CAN BE HARD
TO LIVE YOUR LIFE,

18:21.868 --> 18:23.870
TO BE GENUINELY FULFILLED,

18:23.970 --> 18:27.440
WHEN A PART
OF YOUR TRUE SELF

18:27.540 --> 18:29.676
IS LOCKED AWAY.

18:29.776 --> 18:33.012
I THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS
THAT THE OTHER PART OF YOU--

18:33.112 --> 18:35.014
THE PART THAT TOOK
RESPONSIBILITY,

18:35.114 --> 18:37.150
THAT SHOULDERED
ALL THESE BURDENS--

18:37.250 --> 18:39.886
THAT'S THE PART
THAT GOT REWARDED

18:39.986 --> 18:41.888
EARLY AND OFTEN.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.656
OKAY.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.159
THE MORE YOU TOOK ON,
THE MORE PRAISE YOU GOT.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.927
YOUR DAD
MUST HAVE BEEN RELIEVED

18:48.027 --> 18:50.263
NOT TO HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT HIS WIFE.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.332
AND YOUR MOM--
I CAN IMAGINE

18:52.432 --> 18:54.334
HOW IMPORTANT YOU FELT

18:54.434 --> 18:57.437
JUST KNOWING THAT
YOU WERE HER LIFELINE.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.374
SHE WAS TRICKY.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.511
WE WERE ALWAYS
WALKING ON EGGSHELLS.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.879
MY FATHER AND I
DIDN'T EVEN TELL HER

19:06.979 --> 19:09.048
I WAS GOING TO VIETNAM

19:09.148 --> 19:10.917
UNTIL TWO OR THREE DAYS
BEFORE I LEFT.

19:11.017 --> 19:15.888
AND YOU WERE A HERO
IN VIETNAM AS WELL.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.925
JAMES DONALDSON
WAS THE HERO.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.428
I JUST DID MY PART.

19:21.528 --> 19:24.864
BUT I'M SURE YOU WERE
A NATURAL LEADER.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.866
IN THE CHAOS OF THE WAR

19:26.966 --> 19:29.202
PEOPLE MUST HAVE
LOOKED TO YOU,

19:29.302 --> 19:31.204
AND THEY WERE RIGHT
TO DO SO.

19:31.304 --> 19:34.874
YOU'D BEEN TRAINED
FROM AN EARLY AGE TO STEP UP.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.343
IT HELPED ME SURVIVE.

19:36.443 --> 19:38.945
IT'S ALWAYS HELPED YOU
SURVIVE, WALTER,

19:39.045 --> 19:41.047
EVEN THRIVE.

19:41.147 --> 19:44.351
IT'S HOW YOU ROSE
TO THE TOP OF YOUR FIELD.

19:44.451 --> 19:48.621
EXCEPT THAT IT WASN'T REALLY
YOUR FIELD, WAS IT?

19:49.989 --> 19:51.624
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:51.724 --> 19:53.526
IT WAS JAMES'S.

19:53.626 --> 19:56.696
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY
YOU SPENT YOUR WORKING LIFE

19:56.796 --> 19:59.232
BUILDING THE DONALDSONS'
FAMILY BUSINESS?

19:59.332 --> 20:03.503
WAS IT JUST ANOTHER RESCUE
THAT YOU TOOK ON,

20:03.603 --> 20:06.273
LIKE THE WAY
YOU NURSED YOUR MOTHER

20:06.373 --> 20:11.110
OR YOUR WIFE?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.212
SEE, THAT'S THE PARADOX--

20:13.313 --> 20:15.214
YOU'VE BEEN REWARDED
FOR SO LONG

20:15.315 --> 20:18.985
FOR YOUR GRACE
UNDER FIRE

20:19.085 --> 20:21.454
THAT YOU JUST DON'T THINK

20:21.554 --> 20:23.323
YOU'RE OF ANY VALUE
TO ANYBODY

20:23.423 --> 20:25.325
UNLESS YOU'RE IN THAT ROLE.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.460
NOW THAT
YOU'VE LAUNCHED THEM,

20:27.560 --> 20:30.062
YOUR BOYS DON'T WANT
TO GET TO KNOW YOU.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.164
NATALIE WAS DONE WITH YOU.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.301
I DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU AT THE DOOR.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.936
THE ONLY WAY
TO FEEL NOT REJECTED

20:37.036 --> 20:39.238
IS TO CARRY THE WEIGHT

20:39.339 --> 20:41.040
AND TO KEEP CARRYING IT,

20:41.140 --> 20:43.042
EVEN THOUGH YOUR MIND
AND YOUR BODY

20:43.142 --> 20:45.578
ARE SCREAMING
AT YOU TO STOP.

20:56.689 --> 20:59.959
WELL, I'VE STOPPED NOW,
HAVEN'T I?

21:01.694 --> 21:04.697
WALTER BARNETT,
THE C.E.O.--

21:04.797 --> 21:06.433
HE'S GONE.

21:08.735 --> 21:11.170
HE CAME TO YOU
WITH A SLEEPING PROBLEM,

21:11.270 --> 21:16.042
AND WITHIN WEEKS
HIS LIFE WAS IN SHAMBLES.

21:16.142 --> 21:18.010
I THINK WE BOTH UNDERSTAND

21:18.110 --> 21:19.512
THAT BY THE TIME
YOU CAME TO SEE ME

21:19.612 --> 21:21.514
THERE WAS NO WAY
TO PREVENT THE CRASH.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.183
YOU KNEW I WAS HEADED
FOR THIS?

21:24.283 --> 21:27.654
THE WALTER YOU KNEW,
THE HERO--

21:27.754 --> 21:30.557
HE STAVED IT OFF
AS LONG AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

21:30.657 --> 21:33.826
IF HE COULD HAVE
HELD IT TOGETHER THIS TIME,

21:33.926 --> 21:35.628
HE WOULD HAVE.

21:38.064 --> 21:40.733
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER
EITHER WAY, DOES IT?

21:41.868 --> 21:43.736
WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.171
WHAT IS THAT?

21:45.271 --> 21:46.906
I MISSED IT.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.108
WHAT DID YOU MISS?

21:49.208 --> 21:50.810
MY LIFE.

21:52.211 --> 21:53.880
ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

21:59.552 --> 22:02.254
I'M 68 YEARS OLD,

22:02.355 --> 22:05.858
AND I HAVEN'T LIVED
ONE MOMENT OF MY LIFE

22:05.958 --> 22:08.060
FOR MYSELF.

22:10.363 --> 22:12.832
WHAT THE HELL AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THAT?

22:19.406 --> 22:21.674
ARE YOU GOING
TO SAY ANYTHING?

22:23.576 --> 22:26.312
JUST THAT I THINK
THAT NOW IS THE TIME

22:26.413 --> 22:29.248
TO STOP TAKING CARE
OF EVERYBODY ELSE, WALTER,

22:29.348 --> 22:33.586
AND START RECONNECTING
TO YOURSELF.

22:35.254 --> 22:37.624
WAS THIS YOUR PLAN
ALL ALONG--

22:37.724 --> 22:40.593
TO BREAK ME DOWN
SO THAT I'D BECOME
DEPENDENT ON YOU?

22:40.693 --> 22:43.663
THIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
MY CONSCIOUS CHOICE FOR YOU

22:43.763 --> 22:46.833
ANY MORE THAN IT WAS YOURS.

22:46.933 --> 22:50.637
BUT THE DEFENSES
THAT HELD YOU TOGETHER
YOUR WHOLE LIFE--

22:50.737 --> 22:53.105
THEY JUST FINALLY
WORE OUT.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.307
YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES NOW.

22:55.408 --> 22:58.611
WE CAN TRY
TO WRAP YOU BACK UP,

22:58.711 --> 23:02.114
WORK ON SIMPLE
BEHAVIORAL CHANGES.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.984
AND YOU AND I CAN BOTH TALK

23:05.084 --> 23:07.186
TO YOUR PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGIST,

23:07.286 --> 23:10.156
GET YOU BACK TO MANAGING THINGS
THE WAY YOU ALWAYS HAVE.

23:10.256 --> 23:13.626
IT'S A VALID APPROACH.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.796
OR?

23:16.896 --> 23:19.532
THERE'S A MORE
CHALLENGING ROUTE.

23:19.632 --> 23:22.602
IF WE CAN KEEP GOING,
DOING THE WORK THAT WE DO,

23:22.702 --> 23:25.438
EVEN AT THIS STAGE
OF YOUR LIFE

23:25.538 --> 23:27.440
I KNOW THAT YOU
CAN ACHIEVE

23:27.540 --> 23:30.843
A NEW WAY OF BEING

23:30.943 --> 23:33.513
WITH CONNIE, WITH NATALIE
AND THE BOYS,

23:33.613 --> 23:38.384
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
WITH YOURSELF.

23:38.485 --> 23:41.387
AND WE CAN KEEP EXPLORING
THOSE PARTS OF YOURSELF

23:41.488 --> 23:44.557
THAT WE'VE JUST BEGUN
TO DISCOVER.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.294
I'M AN OLD DOG, PAUL.

23:48.394 --> 23:51.097
70 ISN'T OLD, WALTER.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.099
IT WILL TAKE WORK--

23:53.199 --> 23:57.504
GENUINE INTROSPECTION.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.706
AND YOU'LL HAVE TO COME
MORE OFTEN.

23:59.806 --> 24:02.975
YOU REALLY WANT TO SPEND
A COUPLE MORE HOURS A WEEK

24:03.075 --> 24:05.845
WITH AN OLD MAN?

24:05.945 --> 24:08.314
I WOULDN'T OFFER IT
IF I DIDN'T THINK

24:08.414 --> 24:11.718
IT WAS WORTH
YOUR TIME AND MINE.

24:11.818 --> 24:14.020
WHY IS IT WORTH YOUR TIME?

24:15.555 --> 24:18.525
BECAUSE YOU'VE RESCUED
SO MANY OTHERS,

24:19.592 --> 24:20.693
I WANT TO BE THERE

24:20.793 --> 24:24.964
WHEN YOU GO BACK
AND RESCUE YOURSELF.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.209
FINE, PAUL.

24:39.345 --> 24:40.780
FINE.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.255
WHEN DO WE START?

24:55.528 --> 25:01.534
( theme music playing )
