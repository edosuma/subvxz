00:00.102 --> 00:02.904
Previously on "Project Blue Book"...

00:02.906 --> 00:05.907
Can I ask you a serious question?

00:05.909 --> 00:08.910
Absolutely not.

00:11.114 --> 00:14.672
You've been lying to all
of us this whole time.

00:14.674 --> 00:15.896
You work for the Russians.

00:15.898 --> 00:17.520
I will take the blame for everything.

00:17.522 --> 00:20.011
No, no, no, no, no. I'd
still be accused of colluding.

00:20.013 --> 00:22.880
My career, everything... over.

00:22.882 --> 00:25.227
I'm sorry.

00:25.229 --> 00:27.719
Your instincts about Susie were spot on.

00:27.721 --> 00:30.090
Quinn... what are we
gonna do about that?

00:30.092 --> 00:31.225
This is far from over.

00:32.962 --> 00:34.495
We'll get through this, Doc.

00:34.497 --> 00:36.931
As long as we're all together.

_

01:14.302 --> 01:19.707
Inbound aircraft heading
vector 210 at 12-700,

01:19.709 --> 01:21.942
this is RCAF Air Traffic Control.

01:23.144 --> 01:25.979
Be advised, you have
entered Canadian airspace.

01:25.981 --> 01:27.405
Please identify yourself.

01:32.320 --> 01:35.421
Pilot, you are in violation
of Canadian airspace.

01:35.423 --> 01:37.423
You must ID immediately.

01:37.425 --> 01:39.225
It's probably just some bush pilot

01:39.227 --> 01:40.558
fell asleep at the wheel again.

01:43.530 --> 01:48.433
Control, this is zero-two-

01:48.435 --> 01:52.304
throttle...

01:52.306 --> 01:54.466
Over.

01:54.468 --> 01:56.624
Pilot, we're having a
hard time hearing you.

01:56.626 --> 01:58.326
Can you please repeat?

01:58.328 --> 02:01.396
Climb to 15,000. Heading 1-8-0.

02:04.634 --> 02:06.835
Where'd that come from?

02:06.837 --> 02:09.737
Pilot, we're seeing
an object of some kind

02:09.739 --> 02:11.339
directly in your flight path.

02:11.341 --> 02:13.508
Do you see anything up there?

02:13.510 --> 02:15.576
What is that?

02:15.578 --> 02:17.279
I'm... I'm not sure.

02:20.483 --> 02:22.517
It's headed straight for them.

02:22.519 --> 02:24.151
It's coming right as us!

02:24.153 --> 02:25.186
What in the hell?

02:25.188 --> 02:26.987
- Pull up!
- I'm trying!

02:26.989 --> 02:29.190
Pilot, can you acknowledge, please?

02:29.192 --> 02:31.625
- What's going on?
- What is that thing?

02:31.627 --> 02:34.047
- They're gonna crash.
- Pilot, change course.

02:34.049 --> 02:35.329
It's headed right for us!

02:35.331 --> 02:36.530
Pilot, change course.

02:36.532 --> 02:37.764
Change course!

02:37.766 --> 02:39.633
Change course.

02:39.635 --> 02:41.901
- It's gonna hit us!
- The controls are jammed!

02:41.903 --> 02:44.071
Mayday! Mayday!

02:44.073 --> 02:47.073
We have lost complete
control! What is ha...

03:00.689 --> 03:03.423
I did try calling first.

03:03.425 --> 03:05.691
A lot, actually.

03:05.693 --> 03:07.093
Phone's not working.

03:08.529 --> 03:09.829
Can we talk?

03:09.831 --> 03:12.198
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

03:15.136 --> 03:17.636
Excuse the mess.

03:21.309 --> 03:22.942
What happened in here?

03:22.944 --> 03:26.246
Well, I told the generals everything.

03:26.248 --> 03:28.181
About Susie?

03:28.183 --> 03:30.316
Yeah, I think they took
it rather well, actually.

03:30.318 --> 03:32.941
- What, they did this?
- No, FBI.

03:32.943 --> 03:35.388
They brought them in to
look for listening devices.

03:35.390 --> 03:38.091
Very thorough, as you can see.

03:39.460 --> 03:40.526
Didn't find any,

03:40.528 --> 03:43.696
so, you know, I guess
I got that going for me.

03:43.698 --> 03:45.765
So what happens now?

03:47.334 --> 03:50.286
"Until such a time as we can determine

03:50.288 --> 03:52.637
if your actions warrant
a permanent discharge,

03:52.639 --> 03:55.440
you will be placed on
administrative leave".

04:07.754 --> 04:09.821
She really had me fooled, Doc.

04:09.823 --> 04:11.589
You weren't the only one.

04:11.591 --> 04:14.793
Yeah, but I'm the only one
that can be held accountable.

04:21.535 --> 04:24.636
You know the thing that really gets me?

04:24.638 --> 04:27.539
Air Force is questioning my loyalty.

04:29.509 --> 04:31.342
I've... I've dedicated my life

04:31.344 --> 04:34.412
to defending this country, you know?

04:34.414 --> 04:36.548
To be judged like this now...

04:38.585 --> 04:40.351
Yeah. I-I don't blame them.

04:40.353 --> 04:43.054
It's, uh... objectively speaking...

04:44.436 --> 04:47.227
It makes sense given
the political climate.

04:47.229 --> 04:48.793
Oh, so you came by to cheer me up, huh?

04:48.795 --> 04:51.228
- Thanks.
- No, I...

04:51.230 --> 04:53.641
You know, things have
been hard at home, too.

04:53.643 --> 04:56.868
They questioned Mimi and
I for ten hours straight.

04:56.870 --> 04:58.870
I don't question your loyalty.

04:58.872 --> 05:00.705
Do I? I know who you are.

05:03.710 --> 05:05.577
I look up to you.

05:06.613 --> 05:07.679
Thanks.

05:09.415 --> 05:10.782
Me too.

05:14.854 --> 05:18.356
I was actually coming by to, uh...

05:18.358 --> 05:22.026
tell you that I was thinking
of taking a sabbatical also.

05:22.028 --> 05:24.328
You know, I'll... I'll
continue with my studies

05:24.330 --> 05:25.429
and all of that.

05:25.431 --> 05:29.066
Uh, the science of
UFOlogy is in its infancy,

05:29.068 --> 05:30.734
and it needs the kind of rigorous study

05:30.736 --> 05:33.504
that you and I can provide...

05:33.506 --> 05:35.473
that... that we did provide.

05:39.879 --> 05:41.712
So that's it, huh?

05:41.714 --> 05:43.280
No, it's not.

05:43.282 --> 05:47.487
Because this case just
came in, which is, uh...

05:49.322 --> 05:52.456
Potentially far too interesting
to walk away from.

05:53.859 --> 05:57.660
A plane collided with a
UFO over Canadian airspace.

05:57.662 --> 05:58.961
"Collided"?

05:58.963 --> 06:02.099
Well, Canadian Air Force,
they don't have a UFO program.

06:02.101 --> 06:06.636
They asked if we would, uh,
assist with the investigation.

06:06.638 --> 06:09.739
Oh, yeah? What'd you say?

06:09.741 --> 06:11.841
I said I'd check with my partner.

06:11.843 --> 06:13.576
Your partner who's technically

06:13.578 --> 06:15.345
supposed to be sitting on
the sidelines right now.

06:15.347 --> 06:17.022
I've never been officially
informed of this,

06:17.024 --> 06:19.115
but, uh, yes, yes.

06:19.117 --> 06:22.885
It's not like if anyone
wanted to check on you,

06:22.887 --> 06:25.422
they'd even be able
to get a hold of you.

06:25.424 --> 06:29.582
Plus, I, uh... I already
bought the tickets.

06:33.898 --> 06:35.665
One last case, huh?

06:35.667 --> 06:38.535
Before we ride off into the sunset.

06:42.766 --> 06:44.407
_

06:47.812 --> 06:49.344
Project Blue Book.

06:49.346 --> 06:51.480
I'm your Vice Marshall
Christopher Thomas.

06:51.482 --> 06:54.050
Sir, Captain Michael
Quinn, US Air Force.

06:54.052 --> 06:55.751
- This is Dr. Allen Hynek.
- Pleasure.

06:55.753 --> 06:58.087
And if you don't mind me asking,

06:58.089 --> 07:00.556
how'd you hear about Blue
Book all the way up here?

07:00.558 --> 07:02.858
I've actually been advocating
for a program like yours

07:02.860 --> 07:03.959
for years in Canada.

07:03.961 --> 07:05.061
Please.

07:05.063 --> 07:06.729
So this wasn't your
first encounter, sir?

07:06.731 --> 07:08.430
Uh, no.

07:08.432 --> 07:10.666
I've had dozens of unofficial
reports during my command,

07:10.668 --> 07:14.003
but never anything like this.

07:14.005 --> 07:17.339
We saw the first craft on
radar at approximately 21:30.

07:17.341 --> 07:19.575
This was the bush pilot?

07:19.577 --> 07:21.810
He actually never identified himself.

07:21.812 --> 07:23.745
So this was the unidentified aircraft.

07:23.747 --> 07:25.037
No, sir.

07:25.039 --> 07:28.122
A second unidentified
craft appeared on radar

07:28.124 --> 07:29.718
at approximately 21:32.

07:31.989 --> 07:36.104
We clocked the other one
at over 2,000 miles an hour.

07:36.106 --> 07:38.960
The pilot we were in contact with,

07:38.962 --> 07:40.762
he tried to take evasive maneuvers,

07:40.764 --> 07:43.156
but no matter what he
did, he couldn't get away.

07:43.158 --> 07:45.621
It was as if the other, whatever it was,

07:45.623 --> 07:47.402
was hunting it, sir.

07:47.404 --> 07:49.338
Now, you said on the phone

07:49.340 --> 07:52.230
that's when it looked
like they collided.

07:52.232 --> 07:53.842
You're not sure?

07:53.844 --> 07:57.546
Well, we were sure,

07:57.548 --> 07:59.648
but about an hour after it happened,

07:59.650 --> 08:01.882
our radar picked up
the first plane again

08:01.884 --> 08:04.885
at 60,000 feet.

08:04.887 --> 08:06.454
A prop plane?

08:06.456 --> 08:08.623
- That's not possible.
- That's what we thought.

08:08.625 --> 08:11.259
But then the tower received
another transmission.

08:11.261 --> 08:13.594
We managed to record
it. Would you, um...

08:16.666 --> 08:18.866
Mayday! Mayday!

08:18.868 --> 08:20.734
What is that? Help!

08:20.736 --> 08:23.538
It's coming closer! We
have lost complete control.

08:23.540 --> 08:25.673
Pull up!

08:25.675 --> 08:27.675
- It's taking us!
- Pull up!

08:27.677 --> 08:29.377
It's taking us!

08:30.780 --> 08:32.837
So the supposed collision happened here

08:32.840 --> 08:35.240
near King Island when
they were traveling south.

08:35.241 --> 08:39.077
But that last mayday
transmission at 60,000 feet

08:39.078 --> 08:42.817
was here near Port
Belmont, which is north.

08:42.818 --> 08:44.408
And according to the tape,

08:44.410 --> 08:47.544
the pilots still had visual
contact with the other craft?

08:47.546 --> 08:49.847
Which means if they ditched
or managed to land somehow,

08:49.849 --> 08:51.671
they'd be somewhere in here.

08:51.673 --> 08:54.693
A roughly 200-mile square.

08:54.695 --> 08:56.720
I already scrambled search
and rescue to fly a grid,

08:56.722 --> 08:58.089
but so far nothing.

08:58.091 --> 09:00.125
Sir, what's here?

09:00.127 --> 09:01.525
That's Hartley Bay.

09:01.527 --> 09:03.794
The only thing up there
is a logging outpost.

09:03.796 --> 09:05.463
People?

09:05.465 --> 09:06.964
A few seasonal workers maybe?

09:06.966 --> 09:10.434
- What are you thinking?
- Eyewitnesses on the ground.

09:10.436 --> 09:13.236
Someone up there saw something,
could help narrow our search.

09:13.238 --> 09:15.138
Well, Hartley Bay's
not accessible by road.

09:15.140 --> 09:16.939
You'd have to take a sea plane up there.

09:16.941 --> 09:19.509
I don't have any
available pilots right now.

09:21.013 --> 09:22.745
Sir, as a matter of fact, you do.

09:27.652 --> 09:29.386
Never gets old, Doc.

09:30.822 --> 09:32.655
It's a great view, huh?

09:32.657 --> 09:34.557
It is quite spectacular.

09:37.195 --> 09:39.562
Think you'll go back to teaching?

09:39.564 --> 09:41.697
I'm not sure yet.

09:41.699 --> 09:44.600
Well, I think the generals
would be at a loss

09:44.602 --> 09:46.602
if you left for good.

09:47.772 --> 09:49.572
You may have been a
pain in their ass, but...

09:50.775 --> 09:53.543
They're better off for having you.

09:53.545 --> 09:55.244
Yeah.

09:55.246 --> 09:57.947
I think we did good, Captain.

09:57.949 --> 09:59.916
We weren't the '27 Yankees.

09:59.918 --> 10:02.518
We made for a pretty good team.

10:02.520 --> 10:03.753
Yep.

10:07.792 --> 10:09.959
Maybe I'll go back to
flying for a while.

10:09.961 --> 10:12.728
Be a pilot again.

10:12.730 --> 10:14.597
Well, you certainly seem to enjoy it.

10:18.369 --> 10:20.235
Hey, why don't you
take the yoke for a bit,

10:20.237 --> 10:21.971
- see what it feels like?
- What?

10:21.973 --> 10:23.906
Come on, when are you
ever gonna get a chance

10:23.908 --> 10:25.340
like this again? It's easy.

10:25.342 --> 10:26.741
- It's easy?
- Yeah, come on, take it.

10:26.743 --> 10:28.912
- No, no, no, don't do that.
- I'm letting go.

10:28.914 --> 10:31.771
This is a bad idea.

10:31.773 --> 10:34.215
Just keep it steady.

10:35.652 --> 10:37.619
That's it, relax.

10:41.592 --> 10:43.524
See?

10:43.526 --> 10:45.326
- That's it.
- Okay.

10:47.898 --> 10:49.764
Look at that. You're flying.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.468
Yes, I am. I'm flying.

10:55.072 --> 10:57.271
Doc, you are flying.

11:02.312 --> 11:04.245
You got to be shitting me.

11:04.247 --> 11:07.081
All right, keep me posted.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.983
- They still can't crack her.
- Jim.

11:08.985 --> 11:11.477
They've been interrogating
her for three days,

11:11.479 --> 11:13.387
and she'll only say
that she was sent to Ohio

11:13.389 --> 11:15.379
to find out about our UFO program?

11:15.381 --> 11:16.657
She's good.

11:16.659 --> 11:18.068
And I'm starting to
believe Quinn when he said

11:18.070 --> 11:19.460
- he didn't know who she was.
- I agree.

11:19.462 --> 11:20.828
We still had to put
him on leave, though.

11:20.830 --> 11:22.062
What else could we do?
We didn't have any...

11:22.064 --> 11:23.797
Jim!

11:23.799 --> 11:28.304
I just got a call from one
of our Intel groups in the UK.

11:28.306 --> 11:30.830
They picked up a radio transmission

11:30.832 --> 11:33.240
that the boys in the
CIA managed to decode.

11:36.945 --> 11:38.978
Has this been verified?

11:38.980 --> 11:41.414
That's what we've just
been asked to do...

11:41.416 --> 11:43.383
after we brief the President.

12:03.539 --> 12:05.872
Excuse me. Is this Hartley Bay?

12:05.874 --> 12:08.607
I'm Greg. I run the operation.

12:08.609 --> 12:09.976
You here about the crash?

12:09.978 --> 12:11.811
- Oh, you know about the crash?
- Yeah.

12:11.813 --> 12:13.946
Phones haven't worked since last night.

12:13.948 --> 12:15.347
I sent one of my guys

12:15.349 --> 12:17.216
to Key Junction to
alert the authorities,

12:17.218 --> 12:19.018
but I'd imagine he's still on the road.

12:19.020 --> 12:20.853
Well, can you, uh,

12:20.855 --> 12:22.621
tell us a little more about
what happened last night?

12:22.623 --> 12:25.758
Oh, about 9:30, there was
a earth-shattering boom.

12:25.760 --> 12:28.561
Knocked the power out,
scared me half to death.

12:28.563 --> 12:31.971
Ran outside to see what
it was, but wasn't nothing.

12:31.973 --> 12:33.896
Wasn't till this morning
I found out what happened.

12:33.898 --> 12:35.320
Well, we have reason to believe

12:35.322 --> 12:36.569
that there may still be survivors.

12:36.571 --> 12:38.536
Do you think you could, uh,
get us to the crash site?

12:38.538 --> 12:41.006
"Survivors"?

12:41.008 --> 12:42.874
You mean aliens?

12:42.876 --> 12:45.010
That's why you're here, isn't it?

12:45.012 --> 12:46.745
'Cause it was a UFO crash?

12:46.747 --> 12:49.280
Why do you think it was a UFO?

12:51.719 --> 12:53.551
Jean.

12:54.621 --> 12:59.445
Uh, Greg there said you saw
a UFO fall out of the sky.

12:59.447 --> 13:02.961
That's not what I said.
That's not what I said!

13:05.065 --> 13:06.932
So you didn't see a UFO?

13:06.934 --> 13:09.167
No, I did.

13:09.169 --> 13:12.937
I didn't see a UFO crash,
I saw it cause a crash.

13:14.774 --> 13:15.973
Could you be more specific?

13:17.377 --> 13:20.412
Sure. Last night I
was out hunting a wolf

13:20.414 --> 13:22.680
that's been prowling around my cabin.

13:22.682 --> 13:25.015
Saw fresh tracks. I knew I was close.

13:29.723 --> 13:31.723
That's when I heard it.

13:33.059 --> 13:34.494
It was moving so fast,

13:34.496 --> 13:35.793
I didn't think it was possible.

13:35.795 --> 13:37.995
And that plane looked
like it tried real hard

13:37.997 --> 13:39.130
to move out the way,

13:39.132 --> 13:41.566
but it was just hit by this light.

13:43.703 --> 13:47.772
Plane split in two before
it fell behind those trees.

13:52.311 --> 13:55.418
We get jets out here all
the time from the base,

13:55.420 --> 13:57.681
so I just assumed it belonged to them.

13:57.683 --> 14:00.437
I tried to call. The phone's been down.

14:00.439 --> 14:02.161
And you think you could estimate

14:02.163 --> 14:05.089
- where this plane went down?
- Beyond that ridge.

14:05.091 --> 14:07.091
- At least five miles.
- That way?

14:07.093 --> 14:09.026
- You sure?
- Positive.

14:11.197 --> 14:12.830
Thanks for your time.

14:16.922 --> 14:18.544
The last radar transmission

14:18.546 --> 14:20.237
had it heading the opposite way.

14:20.239 --> 14:22.739
Well, if they lost power,
stopped transmitting,

14:22.741 --> 14:25.742
could've gone down any direction.

14:25.744 --> 14:27.877
We need to get back in the air.

14:27.879 --> 14:28.978
Call the base.

14:42.728 --> 14:45.762
Tell Air Vice Marshall Thomas
to divert the operation east

14:45.764 --> 14:47.831
toward Hawkesbury Island.

14:47.833 --> 14:50.200
Eyewitness saw what
we think was a crash.

14:50.202 --> 14:51.868
If you can stand down, I'll relay,

14:51.870 --> 14:54.571
and we should have support on
your position in a few hours.

14:54.573 --> 14:56.529
That's a negative. We
don't have time to wait.

14:56.531 --> 14:58.241
There could be survivors on the...

14:58.243 --> 14:59.275
What do you see?

15:00.578 --> 15:02.979
- Does that look like, uh...
- Part of a plane?

15:02.981 --> 15:04.881
Yes, it does. Hold on, Doc.

15:10.722 --> 15:12.688
That's part of a wing.

15:12.690 --> 15:15.258
So where's the rest of the plane?

15:15.260 --> 15:17.560
Jean said it broke in half in the sky.

15:17.562 --> 15:19.528
It could be scattered
all over this area.

15:20.945 --> 15:22.966
What about survivors?

15:22.968 --> 15:25.902
This is not a good sign, Doc.

15:27.839 --> 15:28.904
Look!

15:30.941 --> 15:33.008
Anybody out there?

15:35.212 --> 15:37.246
Anybody hear us?

15:37.248 --> 15:39.749
Hello! Hello!

15:42.186 --> 15:44.319
Whoever it was, they got themself down.

15:44.321 --> 15:46.121
Can't be far.

15:46.123 --> 15:49.992
Hello? Anyone out here?

15:49.994 --> 15:51.894
Anybody hear us?

15:53.665 --> 15:54.787
There.

16:03.874 --> 16:04.939
Is he breathing?

16:08.111 --> 16:09.343
It's okay!

16:09.345 --> 16:11.201
It's okay.

16:15.985 --> 16:19.586
The plane. Where's my plane?

16:19.588 --> 16:22.723
I need to know. I need to know now.

16:25.740 --> 16:26.839
All right, easy.

16:26.841 --> 16:28.561
We just want to make
sure you're okay first.

16:29.816 --> 16:31.205
Who are you?

16:31.207 --> 16:33.030
I'm Captain Michael Quinn, US Air Force.

16:33.032 --> 16:34.172
This is Dr. Allen Hynek.

16:35.617 --> 16:37.349
US Air Force?

16:37.351 --> 16:38.451
American?

16:38.453 --> 16:39.519
Right.

16:40.922 --> 16:43.091
I thought I was in Canada.

16:43.093 --> 16:44.849
We're with Project Blue Book.

16:44.851 --> 16:46.349
We were asked to help investigate

16:46.351 --> 16:48.085
the plane's disappearance.

16:48.087 --> 16:50.320
Now, according to radar,

16:50.322 --> 16:51.734
there was another object

16:51.736 --> 16:53.457
- in your flight path.
- The plane's nearby.

16:54.559 --> 16:55.792
I'm gonna radio in,

16:55.794 --> 16:57.594
get search and rescue to
divert to our new location.

16:57.596 --> 17:00.997
We don't have time for that.
My copilot's still out there.

17:00.999 --> 17:02.599
We have to find him and the plane...

17:02.601 --> 17:03.734
now.

17:18.883 --> 17:21.083
Air Vice Marshall Thomas.

17:21.085 --> 17:23.886
Generals Harding and Valentine,
United States Air Force.

17:23.887 --> 17:25.454
From Wright-Pat.

17:25.457 --> 17:26.759
I'm sorry. I didn't
know you were coming.

17:26.761 --> 17:28.958
- We're in the middle of a...
- Search and rescue.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.361
We know. Did you find it yet?

17:31.363 --> 17:34.787
The aircraft? How do
you know about that?

17:34.789 --> 17:35.911
What's going on?

17:35.913 --> 17:38.737
We should speak in a secure room.

17:38.739 --> 17:40.071
This way.

17:41.205 --> 17:44.274
So where were you guys coming
from before you had to ditch?

17:44.276 --> 17:46.276
I only ask because your
plane was in communication

17:46.278 --> 17:48.944
with RCAF ground control, but
you never identified yourself.

17:48.946 --> 17:51.212
- Didn't I?
- You don't remember that?

17:51.214 --> 17:52.847
Alex!

17:52.849 --> 17:54.506
Can you tell me where
you were headed at least?

17:54.508 --> 17:57.619
It might help us locate the aircraft.

17:57.621 --> 18:00.622
I had cargo headed to Alaska
coming over from Greenland.

18:00.624 --> 18:02.056
Everything after that's a blur.

18:02.058 --> 18:03.448
Oh, yeah? What kind of cargo?

18:03.450 --> 18:04.593
Alex!

18:04.595 --> 18:06.695
I thought you guys wanted to help.

18:06.697 --> 18:09.631
Just trying to make sense
of what happened, that's all.

18:09.633 --> 18:11.065
- Something's off.
- No, no.

18:11.067 --> 18:12.224
He's... he's still in shock.

18:12.226 --> 18:14.002
What, he can't tell us
anything that's gonna help us?

18:14.004 --> 18:16.271
Well, it could be another explanation.

18:16.273 --> 18:19.034
UFO abductees often report
a period of missing time

18:19.036 --> 18:20.808
following an encounter...
hours, sometimes days.

18:20.810 --> 18:22.209
Yeah, but this guy wasn't abducted.

18:22.211 --> 18:24.044
Yeah, well, he disappeared
for an hour on radar.

18:24.046 --> 18:25.846
We don't know what
happened during that time.

18:25.848 --> 18:28.649
Over here. Look at this.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.453
Burn marks.

18:32.455 --> 18:34.545
Those trees were
ripped apart from above.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.023
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, we must be close.

18:39.128 --> 18:41.228
- He's that way.
- Yeah.

18:41.230 --> 18:43.364
Alex!

18:45.802 --> 18:46.834
Alex!

18:49.137 --> 18:51.838
Alex!

18:58.647 --> 19:01.080
There's no way that's
part of a cargo craft.

19:01.082 --> 19:03.850
Then what is it?
And where's the rest of it?

19:19.133 --> 19:21.267
Is he in there?

19:21.269 --> 19:23.702
Come on, buddy.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.872
I got you.

19:27.976 --> 19:29.876
Stay there. Take him out.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.677
He's still breathing.

19:31.679 --> 19:33.205
- Easy.
- I got you.

19:33.207 --> 19:34.896
We don't know what kind
of injuries he could have.

19:34.898 --> 19:37.083
It's okay. He needs some air.
Get him over to that tree, please.

19:37.085 --> 19:38.117
Come on.

19:44.692 --> 19:45.925
Steady.

19:53.802 --> 19:54.901
Alex.

19:56.327 --> 19:57.903
Alex.

19:59.973 --> 20:02.875
Alex. Alex.

20:02.877 --> 20:04.811
Alex, look at me.

20:05.969 --> 20:08.213
Look at me, buddy.

20:08.215 --> 20:11.082
The plane. Where's the plane?

20:11.084 --> 20:13.619
- What happened?
- Shh, shh, shh.

20:13.621 --> 20:15.921
- Where's the rest of the plane?
- Where's what?

20:19.026 --> 20:20.125
The plane, Alex.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.730
What happened to the
plane? What happened?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.034
You guys got a medical kit on board?

20:29.036 --> 20:30.702
I'll go check.

20:30.704 --> 20:32.871
No, no, no, no. Wait.

20:32.873 --> 20:34.072
God damn it.

20:42.749 --> 20:45.850
You got to be fucking kidding me.

20:45.852 --> 20:48.820
Alex, I am Dr. Hynek.

20:48.822 --> 20:51.222
Can you remember at
all how you got here?

20:51.224 --> 20:53.058
They're US Air Force.

20:53.060 --> 20:54.692
We're in Am... America?

20:54.694 --> 20:57.128
Something caused you to
fly off course and crash.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.030
Do you recall what that was?

20:59.032 --> 21:00.265
I can't remember anything.

21:00.267 --> 21:01.967
Hey, Doc.

21:06.206 --> 21:07.605
Excuse me a second.

21:24.858 --> 21:26.557
What is it?

21:26.559 --> 21:27.992
Look at this instrument panel.

21:34.144 --> 21:36.000
That's Russian.

21:36.002 --> 21:37.434
This is a bomber,

21:37.436 --> 21:40.144
which means that those
two are Russian military.

21:40.146 --> 21:42.172
You sure?-

21:46.045 --> 21:47.645
He is now.

21:53.018 --> 21:55.775
Lieutenant Colonel Yuri Obolensky.

21:55.777 --> 21:59.899
Yuri, that's a pretty good
American accent you got there.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.567
Spasiba.

22:01.569 --> 22:03.602
You realize half the
Royal Canadian Air Force

22:03.604 --> 22:05.124
is out here looking for you right now?

22:06.507 --> 22:09.531
Not at this location. Hmm?

22:09.533 --> 22:10.789
Isn't that what you said earlier?

22:10.791 --> 22:12.180
Look, I'm not sure what you're planning

22:12.182 --> 22:15.014
on doing right now, but
with no plane, no way out...

22:15.016 --> 22:18.084
hurting us won't help you in the least.

22:22.190 --> 22:23.890
I'm not going to hurt you.

22:23.892 --> 22:26.291
I need your help to find
the rest of the plane.

22:27.827 --> 22:29.227
Move.

22:33.033 --> 22:35.066
This thing's got to be scattered

22:35.068 --> 22:37.002
into a million pieces out here.

22:37.004 --> 22:38.503
What the hell do you need our help for?

22:38.505 --> 22:40.305
I need what was on that plane,

22:40.307 --> 22:42.240
which I'm pretty sure is intact,

22:42.242 --> 22:43.841
because if it wasn't,

22:43.843 --> 22:46.912
everything within five miles of
here would be destroyed by now.

22:46.914 --> 22:50.315
Five miles? That's...

22:50.317 --> 22:54.480
roughly the blast radius
of a... of a nuclear bomb.

22:58.024 --> 23:02.059
Not including radioactive fallout...

23:02.061 --> 23:03.127
yes, you are correct.

23:05.698 --> 23:08.232
Are you telling me you had
a nuclear bomb on your plane?

23:08.234 --> 23:10.902
That is what I'm saying, yes.

23:10.904 --> 23:12.603
And it's still out there.

23:12.605 --> 23:15.940
And if it goes off, it
will start World War III.

23:18.945 --> 23:22.313
Where the hell were you
going before you crashed?

23:22.315 --> 23:25.502
We're testing North American airspace.

23:25.504 --> 23:26.726
It's nothing you Americans don't do.

23:26.728 --> 23:28.586
Yeah, not with a live nuke!

23:29.812 --> 23:31.421
Are you insane?

23:31.423 --> 23:34.123
- You Russians, man!
- Just... Captain!

23:34.125 --> 23:36.125
So you just wanted to
get picked up on radar,

23:36.127 --> 23:37.894
then turn back, is that it?

23:37.896 --> 23:38.995
Yes.

23:38.997 --> 23:41.297
But you encountered another craft.

23:41.299 --> 23:42.899
We don't know what it was.

23:44.269 --> 23:48.104
All I know is that is separated
us from the fuselage...

23:48.106 --> 23:52.976
almost purposely... then
dropped us like toys.

23:52.978 --> 23:55.278
I don't remember much else, do you?

23:55.280 --> 23:57.814
Why do you say purposefully?

23:57.816 --> 24:01.351
I remember thinking
that whatever that was,

24:01.353 --> 24:03.987
it was trying to take the bomb from us.

24:10.370 --> 24:13.033
No, here's what I think.

24:13.035 --> 24:14.897
I think you're a couple of shit pilots.

24:14.899 --> 24:17.623
You got picked up on radar,
took too many Gs heading back,

24:17.625 --> 24:19.134
and your plane tore apart.

24:19.136 --> 24:21.203
Now you want us to
believe this horseshit.

24:21.205 --> 24:22.838
You know what I think?

24:22.840 --> 24:25.875
I think the bomb was still on
the plane when it went down.

24:25.877 --> 24:29.211
And if it hasn't gone off, that
means it's somewhere nearby.

24:29.213 --> 24:31.380
So I have to make sure
that it's safe, okay?

24:31.382 --> 24:32.703
Do you both understand?

24:32.705 --> 24:34.683
Could the force of the
impact have armed it?

24:39.924 --> 24:42.090
Barometric and radar triggers

24:42.092 --> 24:45.494
are designed to go
off beneath 1,000 feet.

24:45.496 --> 24:47.062
But there is an internal safety switch.

24:48.665 --> 24:50.965
What... what... what
about a clock trigger?

24:50.967 --> 24:52.634
It's possible.

24:52.636 --> 24:54.669
But I'm sure it was damaged upon impact.

24:54.671 --> 24:57.805
Right. Meaning it could still arm.

24:57.807 --> 24:59.207
Yes.

24:59.209 --> 25:01.410
So we have no idea

25:01.412 --> 25:03.745
how long it could be
before this thing detonates.

25:09.053 --> 25:10.252
Shit.

25:12.022 --> 25:13.855
We call it a broken arrow.

25:13.857 --> 25:15.056
It's a US military term

25:15.058 --> 25:17.892
for a missing nuclear
asset lost in transit.

25:17.894 --> 25:19.293
We have solid Intel

25:19.295 --> 25:22.430
that points to the unidentified
aircraft that went down

25:22.432 --> 25:24.732
as a Russian bomber.

25:27.070 --> 25:28.803
What's been the Soviet response?

25:28.805 --> 25:31.305
- They've denied any knowledge.
- They're stalling.

25:31.307 --> 25:32.674
If that aircraft managed

25:32.676 --> 25:34.208
to make it back across the Arctic Circle

25:34.210 --> 25:36.978
without going down, they
could avoid the consequences.

25:36.980 --> 25:38.913
Like a counterstrike.

25:38.915 --> 25:42.717
It's our last resort, but
it's definitely on the table.

25:45.088 --> 25:47.889
We've been flying a grid
north of here since yesterday.

25:47.891 --> 25:48.923
So far, nothing.

25:48.925 --> 25:50.725
Your men might have
found something, though.

25:50.727 --> 25:53.561
- Our men?
- Project Blue Book.

25:53.563 --> 25:55.361
They came up to help
investigate the possibility

25:55.363 --> 25:57.865
of a UFO encounter with the aircraft.

25:57.867 --> 25:58.932
Blue Book is here?

25:58.934 --> 26:00.968
They're out in the bush right now.

26:14.083 --> 26:16.382
Your partner, he called you "Captain".

26:16.384 --> 26:18.952
- Are you a pilot?
- Yeah.

26:20.222 --> 26:23.023
I flew in the war. Was
decorated five times.

26:23.025 --> 26:25.324
- You?
- Six.

26:25.326 --> 26:27.994
Six times? That's impressive.

26:29.196 --> 26:30.830
So why are you doing this now?

26:30.832 --> 26:33.344
This Blue Book... studying UFOs?

26:33.346 --> 26:34.500
Why?

26:34.502 --> 26:37.036
I wanted to defend my country

26:37.038 --> 26:38.437
from people like you.

26:38.439 --> 26:40.472
I'm not a UFO.

26:40.474 --> 26:42.011
Yeah, well, you're Russian.

26:42.013 --> 26:44.010
You send spies to
infiltrate our programs,

26:44.012 --> 26:45.745
exploit our fears of the unexplained.

26:45.747 --> 26:48.080
You're worse.

26:48.082 --> 26:50.982
So do you believe in
aliens? They're real?

26:52.119 --> 26:54.253
I do.

26:54.255 --> 26:57.889
After last night, 100%.

26:57.891 --> 27:00.492
We've heard of this Blue Book in Russia.

27:00.494 --> 27:02.093
It's first of its kind, yes?

27:02.095 --> 27:04.429
You don't have a similar program?

27:04.431 --> 27:05.897
Not that I know of, no.

27:05.899 --> 27:09.601
Because Russia does have
its own history of UFOs.

27:09.603 --> 27:11.203
What do you know of our history?

27:11.205 --> 27:14.573
Uh, Tunguska in 1908, a
meteor falls from the sky.

27:14.575 --> 27:18.343
2,000 miles of forest are decimated,

27:18.345 --> 27:20.011
except the witnesses there claim

27:20.013 --> 27:23.791
that it wasn't a meteor at
all but a-a craft of some kind.

27:23.793 --> 27:26.417
What else do you know of this?

27:26.419 --> 27:28.286
Well, after the war began,

27:28.288 --> 27:30.388
did you notice an increase
in sightings at all?

27:32.358 --> 27:34.192
The frequency increased for us, yes.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.194
Yeah, well, we had a spike, too.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.428
Particularly around, uh,

27:37.430 --> 27:41.098
military installations,
uh, nuclear test sites.

27:41.100 --> 27:42.200
Hey, Doc.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.689
You're crossing the line here.

27:49.691 --> 27:51.509
We don't tell the Russians
anything, you understand?

27:51.511 --> 27:52.910
I'm trying to gain trust, Captain,

27:52.912 --> 27:54.978
and if there are UFOs
over Russian nuclear sites,

27:54.980 --> 27:57.280
well, that lines up with
the theory that I have

27:57.282 --> 27:59.881
that UFOs are protecting
us from ourselves

27:59.883 --> 28:01.218
and the weapons we created.

28:01.220 --> 28:02.986
Look, I don't give a damn
about your theories right now.

28:02.988 --> 28:05.222
You keep quiet about
America's nuclear program.

28:06.573 --> 28:08.158
Over here!

28:10.796 --> 28:12.863
The captain radioed in earlier,

28:12.865 --> 28:14.280
said they were following
a lead on the crash,

28:14.282 --> 28:16.033
but it was almost the opposite direction

28:16.035 --> 28:18.301
of where we had the plane
on radar before it went down.

28:18.303 --> 28:20.637
If Hynek and Quinn are following a lead,

28:20.639 --> 28:22.039
it's probably a good one.

28:22.041 --> 28:23.473
Have they checked in sense?

28:23.475 --> 28:24.975
Their only radio's on the plane.

28:24.977 --> 28:26.343
If they're on foot in
the backcountry, they'd...

28:26.345 --> 28:27.978
they'd have to circle
back to let us know.

28:27.980 --> 28:29.246
No, but if they found something...

28:29.248 --> 28:30.771
Which means they'd be
needing our help right now.

28:30.773 --> 28:32.928
Show us exactly where
they were last reported.

29:10.447 --> 29:11.712
How do we know if it's armed?

29:11.714 --> 29:13.648
We have to open it up...

29:13.650 --> 29:15.550
have a look inside.

29:15.552 --> 29:16.784
One of you know how to do that?

29:16.786 --> 29:20.221
I've been trained, but...

29:20.223 --> 29:23.424
to handle anything there
requires a very steady hand.

29:23.426 --> 29:25.542
What, this thing falls out of the sky,

29:25.544 --> 29:26.632
creates this big hole,

29:26.634 --> 29:29.425
but if your hand's not
steady, it blows up?

29:29.427 --> 29:30.497
Makes perfect sense.

29:32.901 --> 29:35.197
So one of us just has to get inside,

29:35.199 --> 29:37.632
and you will talk us
through the rest, yes?

29:37.634 --> 29:38.934
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yeah, I will do it.

29:38.936 --> 29:40.568
You're not going
anywhere near that thing.

29:40.570 --> 29:41.804
Why should you?

29:41.806 --> 29:43.338
I'm not the one who flew it over here.

29:46.210 --> 29:47.910
So you think I want to blow it up now?

29:47.912 --> 29:49.511
Yeah. In a heartbeat.

29:49.513 --> 29:51.280
Stupid Americans.

29:51.282 --> 29:54.216
You think that Russians are the
only ones eager to start war?

29:54.218 --> 29:55.951
Trust me, we are at war right now.

29:55.953 --> 29:57.648
- Maybe I'll kill you myself.
- Go ahead.

29:57.650 --> 29:59.587
Stop it, both of you!
We don't have time for this!

29:59.589 --> 30:01.323
Put that down! Put it down!

30:04.361 --> 30:08.296
Now, I am the only
nonmilitary person here.

30:08.298 --> 30:12.367
I also have a lot of experience
dealing with small tools

30:12.369 --> 30:13.668
in delicate spaces,

30:13.670 --> 30:16.338
transistors, telescopes.

30:17.607 --> 30:19.041
I should be the one to attempt this,

30:19.043 --> 30:20.905
but we have to work together.

30:22.612 --> 30:25.347
Okay? Agreed?

30:27.317 --> 30:29.451
I will show you the steps.

30:29.453 --> 30:31.285
First you need to open the panel.

30:31.287 --> 30:34.788
- Just give us some room.
- What, in case it goes off?

30:34.790 --> 30:36.557
Just stand, what, five feet back?

30:37.960 --> 30:39.560
I'm fine right next to my partner.

30:39.562 --> 30:40.994
Thank you very much.

30:44.199 --> 30:45.532
Doc?

30:45.534 --> 30:48.201
One last case, eh?

30:48.203 --> 30:50.337
- Huh?
- Ride off into the sunset.

30:54.577 --> 30:56.377
Gentle, Doctor.

30:59.247 --> 31:01.248
Should be the one in the middle.

31:11.493 --> 31:12.825
Hey...

31:12.827 --> 31:14.817
if this doesn't go well, we
don't make it out of here,

31:14.819 --> 31:17.009
- I just want to tell you...
- Captain...

31:17.011 --> 31:18.433
that doesn't help.

31:18.435 --> 31:21.934
Yeah. Roger that.

31:24.338 --> 31:25.605
Okay.

31:25.607 --> 31:27.239
I'm ready to take the door off.

31:29.377 --> 31:32.378
- Easy.
- Doctor, please be careful.

31:34.482 --> 31:35.738
Go! Let's go!

31:35.740 --> 31:36.995
A couple of our men found the seaplane

31:36.997 --> 31:38.891
about ten miles east along
with some other wreckage.

31:38.893 --> 31:40.286
What about our guys?

31:40.288 --> 31:42.555
Looks like they headed off on
foot deeper into the forest.

31:42.557 --> 31:44.589
Well, let's get the
hell out there, then.

31:47.494 --> 31:49.661
You should be able to
see the safety switch.

31:49.663 --> 31:52.298
It'll be about a foot tall
with a red and green dial.

31:55.536 --> 31:56.635
Do you see it?

31:59.407 --> 32:00.439
Yes.

32:00.441 --> 32:01.606
What does the dial show?

32:01.608 --> 32:04.310
Well, uh, I can't read Russian,

32:04.312 --> 32:07.112
but it's stuck halfway
between red and green.

32:24.831 --> 32:27.598
That's the arming switch.

32:27.600 --> 32:30.435
If it's stuck in the middle, it
means the bomb could be armed.

32:30.437 --> 32:33.471
Well, can't we just push
the dial back so we know?

32:33.473 --> 32:35.773
- That would risk arming it.
- Or maybe it saves us.

32:35.775 --> 32:37.335
And who would like to take that chance?

32:41.181 --> 32:42.913
There is one other way.

32:42.915 --> 32:44.838
- It's much riskier.
- What's that?

32:46.786 --> 32:48.786
Disconnecting the fireset.

32:48.788 --> 32:50.754
It's a bank of capacitors

32:50.756 --> 32:53.222
that stores electricity
from the batteries.

32:53.224 --> 32:54.760
They, um, carry a charge

32:54.762 --> 32:56.926
that triggers an explosive in the core.

32:56.928 --> 32:58.728
Right, so, if we disable those...

32:58.730 --> 33:01.264
Then we should be good.
But you have to be extra careful.

33:01.266 --> 33:04.501
The charge in those
capacitors could kill you.

33:07.672 --> 33:09.272
What other choice do we have?

33:15.881 --> 33:18.515
Hey, Doc, you got this.

33:42.560 --> 33:44.483
We found it! We found it, sir!

33:44.485 --> 33:46.642
- It's the Russian plane, sir!
- Over here!

33:46.644 --> 33:49.478
We got a lot of broken trees
here... stay out of that area.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.747
It is the Russian plane, sirs!

33:53.851 --> 33:55.884
Where's the rest of the plane?

33:55.886 --> 33:58.319
Well, it's got to be close, right?

33:58.321 --> 34:00.888
Well, if our guys were
here, they can't be far.

34:00.890 --> 34:03.958
Yeah, but are they alone?

34:03.960 --> 34:06.961
All right, men, fan out! And stay alert!

34:06.963 --> 34:10.737
Remember, Doctor, don't
touch the inner housing

34:10.739 --> 34:12.695
or any of the conduit on the floor.

34:12.697 --> 34:14.420
The charge could kill you.

34:27.317 --> 34:28.916
Everything all right in there, Doc?

34:28.918 --> 34:30.585
Yeah, I'm fine.

34:50.406 --> 34:52.572
Take your men over there...

34:52.574 --> 34:54.241
right on that bluff.

35:00.749 --> 35:02.282
I think I did it.

35:03.785 --> 35:06.186
There's 32. You sure you have them all?

35:06.188 --> 35:07.621
32 wires. Yes.

35:07.623 --> 35:10.590
I'm just counting again to be sure.

35:10.592 --> 35:11.691
Hynek.

35:11.693 --> 35:14.828
All good, uh, just need to
check one or two more things.

35:19.067 --> 35:21.300
It should be good. Thank God.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.472
Well done, Doc.

35:29.777 --> 35:31.243
At least we won't die in vain.

35:34.171 --> 35:35.580
What are you doing?

35:35.582 --> 35:38.651
Ah, it's like your partner
said... we're at war.

35:39.954 --> 35:43.488
So, Dr. Hynek, thank you for your work.

35:45.526 --> 35:47.660
But we no longer have
use for either one of you.

35:55.036 --> 35:56.225
You don't want to do this.

35:56.227 --> 35:59.031
I have no choice. I'm sorry.

35:59.033 --> 36:03.703
If Alexei and I make it back to
your plane, maybe we get home.

36:03.705 --> 36:05.505
You're never gonna make it.

36:07.842 --> 36:09.409
With you still alive?

36:10.612 --> 36:13.064
No.

36:13.066 --> 36:16.224
Shoot now, you'll risk setting this off.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.132
Is that...

36:19.134 --> 36:21.091
The core. Yes, I believe it is.

36:21.093 --> 36:23.441
- What do you think?
- Don't shoot.

36:23.443 --> 36:25.166
Doc, what are you doing with that?

36:25.168 --> 36:26.843
I don't know. Do you want it?

36:26.845 --> 36:29.078
No, no, no. Hey, Doctor, Doctor.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.579
- You be careful.
- Oh, well, maybe you want it?

36:30.581 --> 36:32.315
- No, don't do anything crazy.
- Do you want it?

36:32.317 --> 36:33.449
- No, no, no.
- Here!

36:33.451 --> 36:34.583
No, no, no, no, no, no!

36:36.221 --> 36:38.221
Are you insane?

36:39.858 --> 36:43.726
If there were plutonium
inside there, I would say yes.

36:43.728 --> 36:45.328
Which there isn't.

36:45.330 --> 36:48.130
Should weigh about five
times heavier than that, yes?

36:48.132 --> 36:50.952
That's because it's
just the empty casing.

36:50.954 --> 36:52.877
There's nothing inside.

36:52.879 --> 36:54.503
He's right. There's nothing in here.

36:56.107 --> 36:57.506
How did you know?

36:57.508 --> 37:00.275
You told me those capacitors
had enough charge in them

37:00.277 --> 37:03.779
to kill a man, yet when I
slipped up a couple of times,

37:03.781 --> 37:06.314
I didn't get so much as a static shock.

37:07.518 --> 37:10.419
Then when I was finished, I saw
the cap that conceals the core,

37:10.421 --> 37:11.520
and I looked inside.

37:11.522 --> 37:13.255
So you just reached in and grabbed it?

37:13.257 --> 37:15.672
Well, there was no way they were
gonna leave that with us here,

37:15.674 --> 37:17.216
and they don't need us anymore,

37:17.218 --> 37:19.027
so, yes, I did,

37:19.029 --> 37:21.430
and when I picked it up, I knew.

37:23.401 --> 37:24.433
Why?

37:26.203 --> 37:28.504
- Why did our government...
- They had us believe that...

37:28.506 --> 37:30.806
The Kremlin wasn't
testing our air defense.

37:30.808 --> 37:32.608
They were testing you.

37:32.610 --> 37:34.065
They wanted to see how well you'd fare

37:34.067 --> 37:36.724
when you thought you had a
live nuclear weapon on board.

37:36.726 --> 37:38.380
The human element...

37:38.382 --> 37:41.249
it's always the one
variable you can't control.

37:41.251 --> 37:43.151
Yeah. It makes so much sense.

37:43.153 --> 37:45.486
They're not gonna be flying
a live nuke over here.

37:48.825 --> 37:51.059
I guess no one wants World War III, huh?

37:51.061 --> 37:52.894
Hey, Doc.

37:54.464 --> 37:56.905
I really thought you were
gonna kill us back there.

37:56.907 --> 37:58.663
I thought so, too.

37:58.665 --> 38:01.055
When I saw this thing flying
through the air, I thought,

38:01.057 --> 38:03.613
"What is this cocky
American trying to do?"

38:03.615 --> 38:05.907
- Whoo.
- It's nice catch.

38:10.346 --> 38:11.445
Doctor...

38:11.447 --> 38:12.813
thank you.

38:12.815 --> 38:14.448
You're welcome.

38:14.450 --> 38:18.085
Captain, you showed incredible bravery.

38:22.491 --> 38:24.224
Thank you.

38:30.766 --> 38:32.366
You were just about to kill us.

38:32.368 --> 38:33.667
Let's not forget that.

38:47.349 --> 38:48.514
Okay.

38:48.516 --> 38:49.782
Okay.

38:51.386 --> 38:53.219
What will you do with us?

38:53.221 --> 38:54.920
Not up to us now.

38:54.922 --> 38:58.191
Seaplane's about
five-mile hike from here.

38:58.193 --> 39:00.526
We'll head back, radio in.

39:02.397 --> 39:04.697
You know, Captain,

39:04.699 --> 39:06.399
if the four of us can work together,

39:06.401 --> 39:08.368
I'm sure that we could
persuade our governments...

39:08.370 --> 39:09.535
Hands up!

39:16.877 --> 39:18.543
Come on, let's go.

39:21.748 --> 39:23.281
When we get back,

39:23.283 --> 39:25.550
we're gonna need a full
debrief from both of you.

39:25.552 --> 39:28.086
To scrub this clean is
gonna take a lot of work.

39:28.088 --> 39:30.422
What is gonna happen to the pilots?

39:30.424 --> 39:32.624
I can imagine a few scenarios.

39:32.626 --> 39:34.459
But, honestly,

39:34.461 --> 39:37.929
we've never had to deal with a
situation this sensitive, so...

39:37.931 --> 39:40.532
You know, I got to commend you both.

39:40.534 --> 39:43.801
What you did here was heroic.

39:43.803 --> 39:45.737
We just came up here to do our job, sir.

39:45.739 --> 39:48.206
Which makes the work you
do more important than ever.

39:49.475 --> 39:51.910
We need you out in the field.

39:51.912 --> 39:55.073
- Both of you.
- Yes, sir.

39:55.075 --> 39:57.582
Generals... I need you for a moment.

39:59.185 --> 40:01.352
We'll see you back at the base.

40:04.457 --> 40:08.960
So they, uh, never found
the rest of the plane.

40:08.962 --> 40:10.929
I'm sure they will.

40:10.931 --> 40:13.230
I doubt they let us take
a look at it, though.

40:15.602 --> 40:17.713
You still think that unidentified craft

40:17.715 --> 40:19.570
had something to do
with what happened here?

40:19.572 --> 40:21.137
Maybe.

40:22.841 --> 40:27.277
Maybe it wasn't the Russians
that removed the plutonium.

40:27.279 --> 40:29.947
It certainly poses some
interesting questions.

40:29.949 --> 40:32.082
Demands further investigation.

40:32.084 --> 40:34.651
Well, I guess that means
we're back in business.

40:34.653 --> 40:36.820
I guess we are, Professor.

41:00.377 --> 41:01.877
Some things never change.

41:01.879 --> 41:03.957
What's that?

41:03.959 --> 41:06.916
I decide to get in early, you
still find a way to beat me in.

41:06.918 --> 41:10.019
Well, I heard we, uh, got a
few calls while we were gone.

41:10.021 --> 41:12.183
Priest in Akron saw an object

41:12.185 --> 41:14.957
hovering above his church after Mass.

41:14.959 --> 41:16.492
Wanted to pre-interview
him on the phone.

41:16.494 --> 41:19.829
Yeah, look at this...
Missouri, Texas, Maryland.

41:19.831 --> 41:22.031
Never a dull day, huh?

41:22.033 --> 41:23.699
Need anything?

41:23.701 --> 41:26.636
Just some coffee. That'd
be great. Thanks, Faye.

41:32.643 --> 41:33.765
Excuse me.

41:33.767 --> 41:35.455
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yes.

41:35.457 --> 41:37.180
The Senator's here
for Project Blue Book.

41:37.182 --> 41:39.482
- Are they in?
- Senator?

41:40.751 --> 41:43.142
Oh, yes. Senator Kennedy.

41:43.144 --> 41:44.753
Morning, miss.

41:44.755 --> 41:46.921
- Are they, uh, in there?
- Inside.

41:46.923 --> 41:49.791
Yes, um, just this way.

41:51.643 --> 41:53.231
Speak to somebody's who's been...

41:53.233 --> 41:56.898
Gentlemen, Senator
Kennedy is here to see you.

41:56.900 --> 41:58.642
- I'll have to call you right back.
- Oh, apologies,

41:58.644 --> 42:00.243
I'll need to call you
back in ten minutes.

42:00.245 --> 42:01.335
Project Blue Book.

42:01.337 --> 42:03.604
Sorry for the unexpected
visit. It's urgent.

42:03.606 --> 42:05.439
- Senator.
- Senator.

42:05.441 --> 42:06.740
What can we do for you?

42:06.742 --> 42:09.843
Eh, could you give us
some privacy, please?

42:13.082 --> 42:15.449
Whatever you're working on,
I need you to put it down.

42:15.451 --> 42:17.618
We have a situation developing
in the North Atlantic.

42:17.620 --> 42:19.587
What kind of situation?

42:19.589 --> 42:21.489
The crew on a Navy destroyer

42:21.491 --> 42:24.309
spotted a triangle-shaped
craft trailing their fleet.

42:25.861 --> 42:27.861
And you'd like for us
to investigate, sir?

42:27.863 --> 42:29.163
I didn't finish.

42:29.165 --> 42:31.999
The craft they saw
didn't come from the sky.

42:32.001 --> 42:34.701
It came out of the water.

42:42.231 --> 42:46.436
Three, one, five, four, five,
six, four, five, nine...
