WEBVTT

00:04.657 --> 00:05.970
WOLOWITZ:
What are you doing?

00:05.971 --> 00:08.772
Pigeon check for Sheldon.

00:08.774 --> 00:10.807
North side's all clear!

00:10.809 --> 00:13.110
Great. Let's look
at some planets!

00:13.112 --> 00:16.113
Hey, why'd you lug your
telescope all the way over here?

00:16.114 --> 00:17.748
Leonard has one
in our apartment.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.483
Yeah, I'm gonna
use Leonard's.

00:19.485 --> 00:23.020
Might as well hold my hand
up like this and squint.

00:23.022 --> 00:25.556
I don't know.
It seemed pretty good.

00:25.558 --> 00:27.524
You know, once
when the cable went out,

00:27.526 --> 00:29.326
I watched an entire episode
of <i>The Bachelor</i>

00:29.328 --> 00:32.162
on a TV across the street.

00:32.164 --> 00:34.398
This one's more
of a professional model.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.033
So was the girl he picked!

00:36.035 --> 00:40.837
This baby's got a ten-inch
diameter with f/10 ACF optics.

00:40.839 --> 00:42.272
WOLOWITZ:
And tonight

00:42.274 --> 00:45.175
Mercury is
at its highest elongation.

00:45.177 --> 00:50.747
It makes far-away things seem
close, and Mercury is a planet.

00:50.749 --> 00:53.617
I know Mercury is a planet.

00:53.619 --> 00:56.019
But the-the other
thing was helpful.

00:56.021 --> 00:58.422
Oh. Look at that.

00:58.424 --> 01:01.024
- Neil Gaiman tweeted about my store!
- What did he say?

01:01.026 --> 01:02.659
Uh, "Next time
you're in Pasadena,

01:02.661 --> 01:04.227
"check out The Comic Center.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.029
"Great vibe,
old school,

01:06.031 --> 01:08.065
the owner really knows
his stuff."

01:08.067 --> 01:09.933
Isn't that amazing?

01:09.935 --> 01:12.202
Well, uh, it's no <i>Sandman,</i>
but I guess we can't expect

01:12.204 --> 01:14.738
everything he writes
to be a masterpiece.

01:14.740 --> 01:16.340
When was he in your store?

01:16.342 --> 01:19.209
I have no idea.
I think I would remember that.

01:19.211 --> 01:22.646
Obviously, vibranium is the
most powerful metal in comics.

01:22.648 --> 01:24.681
What, more powerful
than adamantium?

01:24.683 --> 01:26.283
He's right.

01:26.285 --> 01:28.885
Wolverine's claws,
Ultron's outer shell.

01:28.887 --> 01:30.354
Need I go on?

01:30.356 --> 01:32.889
You don't need to,
but you probably will.

01:34.093 --> 01:36.860
What about Wonder
Woman's bracelets?

01:36.862 --> 01:38.161
Good point.

01:38.163 --> 01:41.865
Strong as a metal and
fierce as a fashion choice.

01:41.867 --> 01:43.200
GAIMAN:
You know,

01:43.202 --> 01:44.635
Thor's hammer's
pretty powerful,

01:44.637 --> 01:47.471
and in the comics,
it's made out of enchanted uru.

01:47.473 --> 01:49.706
Uh, yeah, I think
it's the enchantment

01:49.708 --> 01:51.708
that's powerful,
not the uru,

01:51.710 --> 01:54.745
but, uh, thanks for playing.

01:56.548 --> 01:58.915
Oh, man, I can't believe
Neil Gaiman came in,

01:58.917 --> 01:59.990
and we weren't even there.

02:27.104 --> 02:29.705
Can you see Mercury?
Can you see it?

02:29.707 --> 02:31.573
One second.

02:31.575 --> 02:34.376
You know, the Greek
version of Mercury, Hermes,

02:34.378 --> 02:36.145
was worshipped
in Athens

02:36.147 --> 02:38.981
by the carving of
giant wooden phalluses.

02:38.983 --> 02:40.616
Please, Amy,

02:40.618 --> 02:43.352
get your mind out
of the ancient Athenian gutter.

02:44.388 --> 02:48.223
Got another follower.
I'm blowing up.

02:48.225 --> 02:49.491
Great. How many does that make?

02:49.493 --> 02:50.526
High double digits.

02:50.528 --> 02:53.028
The nineties?
Mid double digits.

02:53.030 --> 02:54.696
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Hey, uh,

02:54.698 --> 02:55.797
Penny, do you want
to check this out?

02:55.821 --> 02:57.133
Yeah, sure.

02:57.134 --> 02:58.534
All right, just, uh,
look through here,

02:58.536 --> 03:00.736
and if you want to take a
picture, just push that button.

03:00.738 --> 03:02.538
Okay.

03:02.540 --> 03:04.039
Oh, what is that?

03:04.041 --> 03:06.842
(gasps) Is it Mercury? I'm really
jonesing for Mercury.

03:07.945 --> 03:09.111
I think it's a
little early

03:09.113 --> 03:10.512
for Mercury to
be visible yet.

03:10.514 --> 03:12.047
Playing hard to get.

03:12.049 --> 03:13.749
I like that in a planet.

03:15.286 --> 03:17.553
No, there's something fuzzy.

03:17.555 --> 03:20.322
Is it your teen years?

03:20.324 --> 03:22.324
No.

03:22.326 --> 03:24.226
Yes. Shut up.

03:24.228 --> 03:26.628
Look. Look at that.
I think I see something.

03:26.630 --> 03:28.397
It could just be your eyelash.

03:28.399 --> 03:29.765
It's not an eyelash!

03:29.767 --> 03:31.633
Okay, well, uh,
take a picture. Let's see.

03:31.635 --> 03:34.403
Okay. Here.

03:37.274 --> 03:40.008
Hmm. I do see something.

03:40.010 --> 03:41.743
(gasps) Told you.
What is it?

03:41.745 --> 03:43.212
I don't know.

03:43.214 --> 03:45.113
Maybe it's a comet.

03:45.115 --> 03:46.348
That would be so cool.

03:46.350 --> 03:47.683
STUART:
You guys want

03:47.685 --> 03:49.751
to see a real star,
look over here.

03:49.753 --> 03:51.420
What?

03:51.422 --> 03:56.124
I just got retweeted...
by Patton Oswalt's brother.

03:58.896 --> 04:01.430
(crowd chatter)

04:01.432 --> 04:03.599
So, this is really
where Neil Gaiman shops?

04:03.601 --> 04:06.568
Neil Gaiman, Nicolas Cage,
Natalie Portman.

04:06.570 --> 04:08.604
The list goes on.

04:08.606 --> 04:09.605
They all come here?

04:09.607 --> 04:13.075
Unless I'm lying.

04:21.385 --> 04:24.086
Who are all these people?

04:24.088 --> 04:26.355
What? Is this
a flash mob?

04:27.524 --> 04:29.524
Are they dancing?

04:29.526 --> 04:33.061
I don't know what today's
dancing looks like.

04:33.063 --> 04:36.098
Hey, guys. That tweet
actually got people

04:36.100 --> 04:37.566
to come in.
Isn't that great?

04:37.568 --> 04:40.469
No. I liked the way
the store was before.

04:40.471 --> 04:42.971
You mean empty and sad?

04:42.973 --> 04:45.674
Yes, it was perfect.

04:45.676 --> 04:50.579
Like a funeral home that
sells Pokémon cards.

04:51.915 --> 04:53.248
What am I supposed to do now

04:53.250 --> 04:55.317
if I want to hang out
and read a comic book?

04:55.319 --> 04:56.852
Go sit on the couch.

04:58.989 --> 05:01.290
Next to a stranger?

05:01.292 --> 05:03.859
If I'm going to sit, read,
and ignore a woman,

05:03.861 --> 05:06.528
it's going to be my fiancée.

05:06.530 --> 05:08.430
Why are you being
such a baby about the crowds?

05:08.432 --> 05:09.831
You go to Comic-Con.

05:09.833 --> 05:10.899
You-- I'm sorry.

05:10.901 --> 05:13.402
You're comparing this
place to Comic-Con?

05:13.404 --> 05:16.305
Well, can I go to the bathroom
here next to a Wookiee

05:16.307 --> 05:18.573
who got his zipper
stuck in his fur?

05:18.575 --> 05:22.377
Wow. We go to Comic-Con
for different reasons.

05:22.379 --> 05:24.046
You know what?

05:24.048 --> 05:27.215
Just give me a copy
of <i>Action Comics</i> 1000,

05:27.217 --> 05:28.750
and I'll be on my way.

05:28.752 --> 05:30.018
Sorry. All out.

05:30.020 --> 05:33.622
Now you just let people
come in and buy them?

05:33.624 --> 05:37.192
I didn't realize
your soul was also for sale.

05:37.194 --> 05:38.360
STUART:
Well,

05:38.362 --> 05:41.830
it wasn't,
but, uh, make me an offer.

05:44.101 --> 05:46.101
(phone chimes)
Who is that?

05:46.103 --> 05:48.036
Sheldon.
Who is he mad at?

05:48.038 --> 05:49.471
Neil Gaiman.
Who's that?

05:49.473 --> 05:51.707
Not us.
Great.

05:52.676 --> 05:54.476
(knocking)
Guys.

05:54.478 --> 05:55.777
Hi.
Hey.

05:55.779 --> 05:56.878
So, guess what.

05:56.880 --> 06:00.549
That indeed was
a comet last night,

06:00.551 --> 06:02.684
and it turns out,
no one's seen it before.

06:02.686 --> 06:04.186
(laughing): Wow.
Really?

06:04.188 --> 06:07.022
Look at that!
I discovered a comet! Oh!

06:07.024 --> 06:09.157
What do you mean
<i>you</i> discovered it?

06:09.159 --> 06:10.726
Well, I'm the one who saw it.

06:10.728 --> 06:13.095
In my telescope
that I positioned.

06:13.097 --> 06:14.763
All you did was look into it.

06:14.765 --> 06:16.765
Well, you both discovered it.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.134
You can put both your names
on the registration form.

06:19.136 --> 06:21.203
Actually, we can't.
Why not?

06:21.205 --> 06:23.372
Because when I filled it out,
it asked for name of discoverer,

06:23.374 --> 06:26.274
and I put
"Rajesh Koothrappali" because...

06:26.276 --> 06:29.878
because that's who I am,
and that's what I did.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.179
Are you kidding me?

06:31.181 --> 06:33.815
Well, he is the one
who knew it was a comet.

06:33.817 --> 06:36.118
No, he didn't.
He thought it was an eyelash!

06:36.120 --> 06:38.286
And you thought
it was a fuzzy streak.

06:38.288 --> 06:40.756
I mean, do you even know
what a comet is?

06:40.758 --> 06:42.657
Yeah, the thing I saw first.

06:42.659 --> 06:46.495
I honestly don't think that
that qualifies as a discovery.

06:46.497 --> 06:47.696
But I took the picture.

06:47.698 --> 06:48.797
Because I told you to!

06:48.799 --> 06:50.532
Like, if a monkey
took the picture,

06:50.534 --> 06:51.700
did it discover the comet?

06:51.702 --> 06:55.570
Excuse me?!

06:55.572 --> 06:58.006
(stammering):
Uh, he didn't mean monkey.

06:58.008 --> 07:00.208
- Get the hell out of my apartment!
- And she didn't mean that.

07:00.210 --> 07:02.711
Actually, I think she did.
You should go.

07:05.249 --> 07:07.215
You look great.

07:07.217 --> 07:08.683
Oh, thanks.

07:08.685 --> 07:10.385
Would you believe
this is actually a dress

07:10.387 --> 07:11.586
from before I was pregnant?

07:11.588 --> 07:12.821
Well, it's not a competition,

07:12.823 --> 07:16.191
but I wore this suit
to my Bar Mitzvah.

07:16.193 --> 07:17.659
Where's Stuart?

07:17.661 --> 07:19.594
I told him
we had a 6:30 reservation.

07:19.596 --> 07:21.329
Well, I'll call him.

07:21.331 --> 07:23.732
(ringtone plays)

07:23.734 --> 07:27.102
Comic Center,
where the real superhero is you.

07:27.104 --> 07:28.837
Stuart, you're supposed
to be babysitting.

07:28.839 --> 07:30.071
Oh!

07:30.073 --> 07:32.140
Shoot. That was tonight.
I forgot.

07:32.142 --> 07:33.642
The store's been really busy.

07:33.644 --> 07:36.144
Well, when can you get here?

07:36.146 --> 07:38.180
Um, I don't think I can.
Listen to this.

07:38.182 --> 07:40.749
I-I was ringing up a customer,
and I heard someone say,

07:40.751 --> 07:43.819
"Hey, there's a line,"
and I looked, and there was.

07:44.655 --> 07:47.255
Come on. You can't
do this to us.

07:47.257 --> 07:49.591
I am really sorry. I
will make it up to you.

07:49.593 --> 07:52.294
But it won't be with
a Val Kilmer Batman figurine

07:52.296 --> 07:54.729
(laughing): because some sucker's
buying that right now.

07:54.731 --> 07:55.897
(laughs)

07:55.899 --> 07:58.667
Not you. This is great.

07:59.570 --> 08:01.736
He says he has to work.

08:01.738 --> 08:02.938
Oh, it's okay.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.439
We can have date night
another night.

08:04.441 --> 08:06.174
But you got all dressed up.

08:06.176 --> 08:09.277
We were supposed to have
dinner and romance.

08:09.279 --> 08:11.279
We'll just have
to divide and conquer.

08:11.281 --> 08:12.481
I'll go to dinner,

08:12.483 --> 08:15.317
and you can stay home with
the Internet and have romance.

08:18.222 --> 08:19.921
Okay, look, I Googled it.

08:19.923 --> 08:22.157
I took the picture,
so it's my discovery. (scoffs)

08:22.159 --> 08:23.625
He stole my comet.

08:23.627 --> 08:26.127
I know, but on the other hand,
do you really care?

08:26.129 --> 08:28.463
Yes, I care.
This happens to me all the time.

08:28.465 --> 08:29.831
People take one look at me

08:29.833 --> 08:31.666
and assume I don't know
what I'm talking about.

08:31.668 --> 08:33.034
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

08:33.035 --> 08:34.202
I'm sorry. Are you saying

08:34.203 --> 08:36.304
I don't know
what I'm talking about?

08:36.306 --> 08:39.674
No, I'm not saying anything...
ever again.

08:39.676 --> 08:41.643
Look, I'm serious.
The other day at work,

08:41.645 --> 08:44.546
I had this great idea, but
no one was listening to me.

08:44.548 --> 08:46.848
And then five minutes later,
Paul said the same thing,

08:46.850 --> 08:48.717
and they practically
carried him around the room.

08:48.719 --> 08:49.851
Oh, well, what was it?

08:49.853 --> 08:51.453
Well, CPK for lunch,

08:51.455 --> 08:53.889
but that's just one example.

08:53.891 --> 08:55.023
It also happens
with all

08:55.025 --> 08:56.324
the doctors I have to deal with.

08:56.326 --> 08:57.626
You know,
they're so condescending.

08:57.628 --> 08:59.261
I'm so sick
of letting this stuff slide.

08:59.263 --> 09:01.997
I found that comet. Why should
I let Raj say he found it?

09:01.999 --> 09:03.598
I know you're right,
but he is our friend,

09:03.600 --> 09:05.433
and this could be good
for his career.

09:05.435 --> 09:08.336
Okay, so you agree with me,
but he still gets his way?

09:08.338 --> 09:10.639
Ah, there you go.
Everybody wins.

09:10.641 --> 09:12.874
My God, you're such
a people-pleaser.

09:12.876 --> 09:14.376
You can't stand
making anyone angry.

09:14.378 --> 09:16.378
Why would I want
to make anyone angry?

09:16.380 --> 09:18.146
'Cause it would mean
you were on my side.

09:18.148 --> 09:20.549
Oh, I am on your side.
Hey, hey.

09:20.551 --> 09:24.119
Let's not forget who
you're really mad at here-- Raj.

09:24.121 --> 09:27.188
Oh, and Paul.
Paul sucks, right?

09:28.759 --> 09:31.493
But don't tell him I said that.

09:32.629 --> 09:35.997
Hey, Howard,
did you see that...?

09:35.999 --> 09:38.166
(shrieks)

09:42.606 --> 09:44.940
I'm over here, Sheldon.

09:46.710 --> 09:48.677
That was a close one.

09:48.679 --> 09:51.079
I almost went home
with that guy.

09:51.081 --> 09:54.149
You doing okay?
Do we need to go?

09:54.151 --> 09:56.017
No, I'm fine.

09:56.019 --> 09:59.054
I admit all these people did
take me by surprise at first,

09:59.056 --> 10:01.623
but I've learned
that I can accept change.

10:01.625 --> 10:03.792
S-Since when?

10:04.728 --> 10:06.795
I managed it when Amy
switched her shampoo

10:06.797 --> 10:09.264
from Prell
to Prell for oily hair. Hmm?

10:09.266 --> 10:10.865
Although I do miss the way

10:10.867 --> 10:13.702
her head used
to slide off the pillow.

10:18.942 --> 10:20.542
May I help you?

10:20.544 --> 10:21.943
Who are you?

10:21.945 --> 10:24.346
Oh, I'm Denise,
the new assistant manager.

10:24.348 --> 10:26.014
Nope.

10:31.651 --> 10:34.318
Can you believe it?
In the past decade,

10:34.320 --> 10:36.587
I have spent thousands
of dollars in that store,

10:36.589 --> 10:38.322
and this is the thanks I get.

10:38.324 --> 10:41.826
You're right. I mean,
he could at least get you a mug.

10:42.662 --> 10:44.028
He gave me a mug.

10:44.030 --> 10:46.230
What do you think
I'm drinking out of?

10:46.866 --> 10:49.066
Do you even pay attention?

10:49.068 --> 10:51.369
Honestly, less and less.

10:52.605 --> 10:55.239
Amy, the comic
book store

10:55.241 --> 10:58.843
is like my version
of the country in <i>Black Panther.</i>

10:58.845 --> 11:01.445
Okay, I'm afraid this is
gonna get really offensive

11:01.447 --> 11:02.980
to certain groups.

11:05.418 --> 11:08.085
The nation of Wakanda
was a hidden gem,

11:08.087 --> 11:10.388
and they wanted to
keep it that way,

11:10.390 --> 11:13.524
because they knew if they
opened it up to the world,

11:13.526 --> 11:16.694
everything that was special
about it would get ruined.

11:16.696 --> 11:18.929
Are you done?
Yes.

11:18.931 --> 11:21.532
(relieved sigh):
Oh, okay.

11:21.534 --> 11:24.301
That both made sense
<i>and</i> wasn't offensive.

11:25.505 --> 11:28.539
And to make things worse,
Stuart hired some woman.

11:28.541 --> 11:31.108
There we go.
No...

11:31.110 --> 11:33.244
I'm not annoyed
that she's a woman.

11:33.246 --> 11:35.312
I'm annoyed, and
she's a woman.

11:35.314 --> 11:36.747
No, I get that.

11:36.749 --> 11:39.650
I'm annoyed and <i>I'm</i> a woman.

11:40.887 --> 11:43.020
It's just, Stuart knows
my likes and dislikes.

11:43.022 --> 11:45.189
And I can count
on his discretion

11:45.191 --> 11:47.224
if I pick up the
occasional back issue

11:47.226 --> 11:49.960
of <i>Superman's Pal</i>
<i>Jimmy Olsen.</i>

11:51.497 --> 11:54.031
Which I don't.

11:54.033 --> 11:57.034
Well, don't think of her
as a stranger.

11:57.036 --> 11:59.236
Just think of her as a...

11:59.238 --> 12:04.108
a friend you haven't berated,
lectured or condescended to yet.

12:04.110 --> 12:06.911
I hadn't thought
of it that way.

12:06.913 --> 12:08.345
Thank you.

12:08.347 --> 12:10.748
You're welcome.
You're wise,

12:10.750 --> 12:12.716
and you smell like books.

12:14.987 --> 12:16.854
You really are
the whole package.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.493
Raj, just help me out.

12:22.495 --> 12:24.595
Penny's pretty mad
about this comet thing.

12:24.597 --> 12:26.197
Well, I'm sorry she's upset.

12:26.199 --> 12:28.432
But she didn't discover it.
Oh, come on,

12:28.434 --> 12:30.167
you know she was a part of it.

12:30.169 --> 12:31.869
Just add her name
to the registration.

12:31.871 --> 12:34.138
But I already told
everyone at work that I did it.

12:34.140 --> 12:35.272
My boss was so excited,

12:35.274 --> 12:36.874
he started calling me
Captain Comet.

12:36.876 --> 12:38.409
Which is better

12:38.411 --> 12:41.445
than his last nickname for me:
Dr. Doughnuts.

12:41.447 --> 12:43.781
Because one time
I had two doughnuts.

12:43.783 --> 12:46.417
And two times
I had three doughnuts.

12:47.787 --> 12:50.855
I guess you're just gonna
have to swallow your pride.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.923
I, I, I can't do that.

12:52.925 --> 12:56.827
Sure you can-- just pretend
it's two or three doughnuts.

12:56.829 --> 12:58.162
You don't understand.

12:58.164 --> 12:59.830
Leonard, I need this.

12:59.832 --> 13:01.098
My last big discovery was:

13:01.100 --> 13:03.300
if you press
your upper lip hard enough,

13:03.302 --> 13:06.036
you can block a sneeze.

13:07.240 --> 13:09.573
<i>I</i> told you that.

13:09.575 --> 13:11.742
(groans)
This is all my fault.

13:11.744 --> 13:14.144
I brought this
upon myself.

13:14.146 --> 13:16.447
(smacks lips)
I'm a bad scientist.

13:16.449 --> 13:18.549
I'm a selfish person.
No, no,

13:18.551 --> 13:19.617
don't get upset.

13:19.619 --> 13:20.918
You're not a bad person.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.987
Just let me... talk to Penny.

13:22.989 --> 13:24.088
I'm-I'm sure I can

13:24.090 --> 13:25.656
make her understand.

13:25.658 --> 13:28.058
Thank you. You're
a good friend, Leonard.

13:28.060 --> 13:31.629
I'm glad you think so,
'cause I may be living here soon.

13:39.105 --> 13:41.505
Just look at her
over there.

13:41.507 --> 13:43.107
She just started,

13:43.109 --> 13:44.775
and she gets to
put up "Staff Picks."

13:44.777 --> 13:46.310
I've been coming here
for ten years--

13:46.312 --> 13:48.979
I still can't put up
"Sheldon Dislikes."

13:48.981 --> 13:50.481
I talked to her yesterday.

13:50.483 --> 13:52.983
She really seems
to know her stuff.

13:53.819 --> 13:55.686
Challenge accepted.

13:55.688 --> 13:58.689
That is not what that was.

13:59.525 --> 14:01.325
Excuse me.

14:01.327 --> 14:02.993
I was wondering

14:02.995 --> 14:04.328
if you could recommend
something.

14:04.330 --> 14:06.163
Oh, sure. You want
to tell me what you like?

14:06.165 --> 14:07.965
I would not.

14:11.771 --> 14:15.472
All right, well, you're
wearing a Green Lantern shirt,

14:15.474 --> 14:17.107
so I'm guessing
you're a DC fan.

14:17.109 --> 14:18.876
Although that's from
the Alan Scott era,

14:18.878 --> 14:20.711
so you're probably not
super into the current run.

14:20.713 --> 14:23.013
How would you feel about
an alternate history

14:23.015 --> 14:26.016
where World War I was fought
with dragons and magic?

14:26.018 --> 14:27.618
That's what I wanted the theme

14:27.620 --> 14:29.720
of my tenth birthday party
to be!

14:29.722 --> 14:31.055
Here.

14:31.057 --> 14:32.957
Check this out.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.559
It's by Kurt Busiek.
GAIMAN: You know, if you're interested

14:35.561 --> 14:36.994
in alternate histories,

14:36.996 --> 14:39.396
Neil Gaiman wrote one
called <i>1602.</i>

14:39.398 --> 14:42.533
I'm sorry, we're in the middle
of something here.

14:44.503 --> 14:45.703
It is pretty good, actually.

14:45.705 --> 14:46.937
He takes
the Marvel superheroes

14:46.939 --> 14:49.373
and he puts them
into Elizabethan England.

14:49.375 --> 14:53.777
Let me guess-- everyone thinks
the X-Men are witches.

14:54.614 --> 14:55.879
Yeah.

14:58.417 --> 15:01.218
Why don't you take this home,
and if you don't like it,

15:01.220 --> 15:03.187
return it and I'll give
you your money back.

15:03.189 --> 15:04.288
Just don't tell Stuart.

15:04.290 --> 15:06.657
Stuart who?

15:09.629 --> 15:10.761
Hey.

15:10.763 --> 15:14.231
Where have you been?
I went to yell at Raj.

15:14.233 --> 15:16.900
And? Is he gonna
give me back my comet?

15:16.902 --> 15:18.702
Interesting thing.

15:18.704 --> 15:20.504
Did you cave?

15:20.506 --> 15:21.939
Maybe I did, or...

15:21.941 --> 15:23.874
maybe I did.

15:25.444 --> 15:27.444
But I did realize something.

15:27.446 --> 15:30.481
I-I don't need
to fight your battles.

15:30.483 --> 15:31.782
You... you are

15:31.784 --> 15:33.317
a strong and independent woman.

15:33.319 --> 15:35.052
You have your own voice.

15:35.054 --> 15:36.920
And, to quote
another strong woman,

15:36.922 --> 15:39.823
Katy Perry,
it's time to hear you roar.

15:39.825 --> 15:43.260
Did you just think of that
on your way home?

15:43.262 --> 15:45.996
What do you want from me?
The song was on in the car.

15:45.998 --> 15:47.398
But it doesn't mean

15:47.400 --> 15:49.199
that it's not true.

15:49.201 --> 15:50.868
Well, you make a good point.

15:50.870 --> 15:53.103
I'm gonna go talk to Raj myself.

15:54.006 --> 15:55.973
I know I don't say it enough,

15:55.975 --> 15:58.175
but you go, girl.

15:58.177 --> 16:01.111
That was enough.

16:03.449 --> 16:05.449
What's all this?

16:05.451 --> 16:07.618
Well, we missed
our date night,

16:07.620 --> 16:09.987
and Stuart's working again,
so I thought we could have

16:09.989 --> 16:11.622
a date night here at home.

16:11.624 --> 16:13.457
(clicks tongue)
Aw, that's so sweet.

16:13.459 --> 16:16.126
Oh. So... is that
really what you're wearing

16:16.128 --> 16:18.162
to our date night?

16:18.164 --> 16:21.932
Well, Stuart's not here
and the kids are sleeping.

16:21.934 --> 16:23.901
I could wear nothing.

16:23.903 --> 16:25.969
You might want
to hold off on that--

16:25.971 --> 16:28.005
we're starting with soup.

16:28.007 --> 16:29.373
(laughs)

16:29.375 --> 16:31.108
Hey!

16:31.110 --> 16:33.410
Wha...? I thought you
were working late again.

16:33.412 --> 16:35.245
I was, but Denise
has got it covered.

16:35.247 --> 16:36.380
Oh.
Oh...

16:36.382 --> 16:37.848
the funniest thing
happened today.

16:37.850 --> 16:41.051
You know the, uh, receipt tape
in the cash register?

16:41.053 --> 16:42.252
It ran out.

16:42.254 --> 16:43.320
(chuckles)

16:43.322 --> 16:45.322
I didn't even know
it could do that.

16:46.692 --> 16:48.587
You know, we were just
sitting down to dinner.

16:48.611 --> 16:49.728
Oh. Perfect timing.

16:49.729 --> 16:51.195
I'll go wash up.

16:52.531 --> 16:54.465
There goes date night.

16:54.467 --> 16:56.633
Are you kidding?
Stuart's here! Get your purse.

16:56.635 --> 16:58.836
We're going out.
What about the dinner you made?

16:58.838 --> 17:00.671
Right. Hey, Stuart!

17:00.673 --> 17:03.841
That can of soup
sitting by the stove, that's for you!

17:03.843 --> 17:06.175
You made canned soup
for date night?

17:06.178 --> 17:07.845
And you wore sweatpants.
Let's go.

17:11.217 --> 17:14.785
Oh, <i>and</i> it turns out Denise
is also really excited

17:14.787 --> 17:16.619
for Dan Slott's run
on <i>Iron Man,</i>

17:16.622 --> 17:19.289
because he was her favorite
Spider-Man writer, too.

17:19.290 --> 17:21.892
How about that?

17:21.894 --> 17:26.130
Oh! And guess who goes to art school
right here in Pasadena.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.598
Hmm. I don't know.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.800
Denise?

17:30.903 --> 17:33.103
You're a good guesser, Amy.

17:33.105 --> 17:35.472
Not as good
as Denise, though.

17:35.474 --> 17:37.641
She thought I would like
this comic, <i>Arrowsmith,</i>

17:37.643 --> 17:41.245
and she was right.
Well, was the store crowded?

17:41.247 --> 17:42.980
I bet it was.
I know you hate that.

17:42.982 --> 17:45.048
It was. But if it
weren't for the crowds,

17:45.050 --> 17:47.117
Stuart never would
have hired Denise,

17:47.119 --> 17:48.519
and she's the best.

17:53.359 --> 17:54.858
You must be Denise.

17:54.860 --> 17:56.727
Oh, yeah. How
can I help you?

17:56.729 --> 17:58.762
I'm Amy, Sheldon's fiancée.

17:58.764 --> 18:00.597
Oh. I got to be honest,

18:00.599 --> 18:03.600
I wasn't a hundred percent
sure you were real.

18:05.271 --> 18:08.772
Oh, I am. And I heard you and
Sheldon had a great time today

18:08.774 --> 18:10.140
talking about comic books.

18:10.142 --> 18:11.475
We did.
Great.

18:11.477 --> 18:13.644
Here's what's gonna happen.

18:13.646 --> 18:15.312
You're gonna teach me
how to do that.

18:15.314 --> 18:16.446
Do what?

18:16.448 --> 18:18.315
Pretend to like comic books.

18:18.317 --> 18:20.751
Oh, no, I actually
like comic books.

18:20.753 --> 18:22.519
All right, let's not get
hung up on semantics.

18:22.521 --> 18:24.588
It's late, we got
a lot of work to do.

18:27.293 --> 18:30.494
(loud footsteps approaching)

18:32.131 --> 18:33.730
(knocking)

18:34.600 --> 18:36.767
I'm sorry.

18:36.769 --> 18:38.435
I haven't even said
anything yet.

18:38.437 --> 18:40.771
I know, but I heard your
footsteps coming up the stairs,

18:40.773 --> 18:42.272
and they sounded angry.

18:42.274 --> 18:45.309
They are angry.
I'm mad at you.

18:45.311 --> 18:47.077
And you have every
right to be, okay?

18:47.079 --> 18:48.745
I was being...
I was being a jerk.

18:48.747 --> 18:52.416
We did this together, and
I hogged all of the credit.

18:52.418 --> 18:55.886
And after you've been such a good friend
to me over the years.

18:55.888 --> 18:59.256
Like, I wouldn't even be able to talk
to women if it wasn't for you, so...

18:59.258 --> 19:02.759
so I'm... I'm gonna make sure
that your name is on the comet.

19:02.761 --> 19:04.094
Thank you.

19:04.096 --> 19:06.964
Even if it's
professionally embarrassing.

19:06.966 --> 19:11.168
You know, or maybe put me
on thin ice at work.

19:11.170 --> 19:13.570
I may lose my funding.

19:13.572 --> 19:17.174
I still, uh...
still want to make this right.

19:17.176 --> 19:19.676
Good. Bye.

19:22.229 --> 19:25.796
That worked way better
with Leonard.

19:30.690 --> 19:32.824
(door opens)

19:32.826 --> 19:35.593
- Hello.
- Hi.

19:36.163 --> 19:38.630
Why are you reading
a comic book?

19:38.632 --> 19:40.666
Denise recommended it to me.

19:40.668 --> 19:42.301
It's the <i>Rebirth Omnibus.</i>

19:42.303 --> 19:45.070
She thought it would be
a good entry point for me

19:45.072 --> 19:47.139
into the DC Universe--
and I have to say,

19:47.141 --> 19:48.114
- I really do like...
- You know, Amy,

19:48.115 --> 19:50.345
Amy, I've talked a lot about
comic books lately,

19:50.369 --> 19:51.690
can we talk about something else?

19:59.021 --> 20:05.921
