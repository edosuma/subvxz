WEBVTT

00:00.852 --> 00:03.253
<i>Previously on Warehouse 13...</i>

00:06.223 --> 00:08.290
Thank you for remembering
our appointment.

00:11.562 --> 00:13.293
Artie!

00:16.382 --> 00:18.515
How could you possibly
have survived?

00:19.885 --> 00:22.258
The Phoenix?

00:24.467 --> 00:26.770
Harriet Tubman's thimble-
it was me?

00:26.838 --> 00:28.570
Mrs. Frederic, it was me.

00:28.638 --> 00:30.370
The worst case
of identity theft ever.

00:30.437 --> 00:32.039
It's not her fault.

00:35.313 --> 00:37.584
James? James!

00:37.652 --> 00:40.373
I'm sorry, Arthur.

00:49.634 --> 00:52.236
Hi. That's a great color
on you, ma'am.

00:52.304 --> 00:54.437
Hello.

00:54.505 --> 00:56.938
You're never gonna win
these people over.

00:57.006 --> 00:58.605
They will succumb
to my charms, Myka.

00:58.673 --> 01:00.206
They will succumb.

01:00.274 --> 01:02.641
Hi. Hello!

01:02.709 --> 01:04.108
What-whatever!

01:04.176 --> 01:06.076
Come on!
Call me.

01:06.144 --> 01:08.010
It's just bull!

01:15.148 --> 01:17.682
Joy. Is it Tuesday again already?

01:17.750 --> 01:19.350
Uh, yes.

01:19.417 --> 01:21.785
Kiss, kiss to you, Brenda.

01:21.852 --> 01:24.186
You got our stuff or what?

01:27.856 --> 01:29.623
Finally!

01:29.690 --> 01:31.524
It only took six months.

01:33.326 --> 01:35.326
Shipped in from D.C. this morning.

01:35.394 --> 01:37.761
What, are you
taking deliveries from the mob?

01:37.829 --> 01:41.597
M- O-B, Einstein.
Myka O. Bering?

01:41.664 --> 01:43.331
What's the "O" for?

01:43.399 --> 01:44.966
Uh...

01:45.034 --> 01:46.133
Olive?

01:46.201 --> 01:49.735
Olive oil?
Olive Garden?

01:52.305 --> 01:54.672
So not telling you.
Whatever.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.540
Wait, hey, hey, B, B!

01:56.608 --> 01:58.742
What about my stuff?

01:58.810 --> 02:00.077
Sorry, slick.
That's it.

02:00.145 --> 02:01.779
Wha-wha-
if you don't mind...

02:01.846 --> 02:04.648
I'm watching a movie,
and I don't have the Tivo.

02:08.948 --> 02:11.115
It's my books, my music,

02:11.183 --> 02:12.783
my fuzzy slippers.

02:12.850 --> 02:13.917
Yay!

02:13.984 --> 02:17.186
Yay. Let me get you some salt.

02:17.253 --> 02:19.420
Sorry.

02:24.892 --> 02:26.259
They sit there, Arthur,

02:26.326 --> 02:27.526
and they hoard the things
that can save the world.

02:27.594 --> 02:29.060
You've had your chance, Arthur.

02:29.128 --> 02:30.695
So many chances!

02:30.763 --> 02:33.030
You always hurt
the one you love.

02:33.098 --> 02:35.132
Arthur?
Artie?

02:35.199 --> 02:37.800
Hey, you okay?
Yeah. I'm fine.

02:37.868 --> 02:39.501
You sure?
'Cause for a second there,

02:39.569 --> 02:41.402
you seemed untethered.

02:41.470 --> 02:44.471
Weren't you supposed to be
helping, uh, Leena install

02:44.539 --> 02:45.939
the rest
of the new motion detectors?

02:46.007 --> 02:47.774
Getting to it.
Getting to it?

02:47.842 --> 02:50.309
Claudia, if the Warehouse
is vulnerable,

02:50.377 --> 02:52.512
then we are vulnerable.

02:52.579 --> 02:56.082
And we are not going to be
vulnerable ever again.

02:56.149 --> 02:59.018
And there are
other threats out there.

02:59.086 --> 03:00.753
Who, H.G. Wells?

03:00.820 --> 03:02.921
Sister friend kind of did us
a favor by killing-

03:02.988 --> 03:04.989
killing...
Does no one a favor.

03:05.057 --> 03:08.258
That's why we have Teslas,
not bullets.

03:08.326 --> 03:10.260
That's why ethics
are codified in the-

03:10.326 --> 03:12.690
Saved by the beep.

03:12.758 --> 03:14.291
Looks like we got a ping.

03:14.359 --> 03:15.859
You want me to rally
the troops?

03:15.927 --> 03:18.294
No, what I...

03:18.362 --> 03:20.130
What I want is for you

03:20.197 --> 03:23.366
to help Leena install the rest
of the new motion detectors.

03:23.434 --> 03:25.100
Aye aye, Captain Bligh.

03:31.305 --> 03:33.005
Hello, Motor City.

03:52.382 --> 03:55.184
Aah!

03:58.320 --> 04:05.958
âª âª

04:08.828 --> 04:12.196
Now, that's something
I never expected to see.

04:12.264 --> 04:14.565
Yep, yep, yep.

04:14.633 --> 04:16.300
She must have found
an artifact

04:16.367 --> 04:18.168
that makes her act
like a girl.

04:18.236 --> 04:21.503
Hmm, her aura...
It's just so...

04:21.571 --> 04:24.172
Happy? These things
hold special memories for me.

04:24.239 --> 04:26.740
You know? It makes me feel
like I'm, uh...

04:26.808 --> 04:29.342
Home.

04:29.410 --> 04:30.676
We interrupt this concert...

04:30.744 --> 04:34.012
To bring you your
regularly scheduled job.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.013
All right, first this mugger
is delivered

04:36.081 --> 04:39.016
to Detroit Metro police, and
he's in a twisted streetlight.

04:39.084 --> 04:40.752
Look at that.
He's in a coma.

04:40.820 --> 04:42.421
And then this drug dealer-

04:42.489 --> 04:45.157
he is found dangling
from this flagpole-

04:45.225 --> 04:47.526
pretty high up too.
He's in a coma as well.

04:47.593 --> 04:49.794
And by the time it takes
to print these photos,

04:49.861 --> 04:51.895
our mysterious assailant
strikes again.

04:51.963 --> 04:53.930
A person did this?

04:53.998 --> 04:55.232
With what?
If I knew that,

04:55.299 --> 04:57.133
I wouldn't be sending you
both to Detroit.

04:57.201 --> 04:59.268
Plane's in an hour.

04:59.336 --> 05:00.736
Skedaddle.

05:05.541 --> 05:07.842
Ah, listen,
I know things are awkward

05:07.910 --> 05:09.610
between you and Claudia,

05:09.678 --> 05:11.845
but I need you working together
and over it.

05:11.913 --> 05:15.882
Don't talk to me. Talk-
just get it done.

05:30.262 --> 05:31.428
Oh...

05:31.496 --> 05:35.031
Now, that is a big hole.

05:35.099 --> 05:37.266
So, officer Kessman,
according to the reports,

05:37.334 --> 05:40.202
you were the first on scene
at all three incidents?

05:40.270 --> 05:42.371
Yes, ma'am.
I was out walking my beat,

05:42.439 --> 05:45.573
and I hear three shots fired,
followed by a loud crash.

05:45.641 --> 05:47.542
And that's when I look up,
and I see the hole.

05:47.609 --> 05:49.376
But not what caused
no, ma'am.

05:49.444 --> 05:52.246
Fortunately, the occupants
are out of town,

05:52.313 --> 05:54.481
so the only casualty's
the perp.

05:54.548 --> 05:56.249
Okay, well, thank you.
We'll take it from here.

05:56.316 --> 05:58.084
Yeah.

06:01.353 --> 06:03.320
Three shots fired...

06:03.388 --> 06:06.358
No blood...

06:06.426 --> 06:07.993
No bullet holes.

06:08.061 --> 06:09.494
Hey, Mykes.

06:09.562 --> 06:11.730
Check these out.

06:13.699 --> 06:15.433
Bullets.
Yesiree, Bob.

06:15.501 --> 06:18.403
At least they used to be.
Investigators didn't find these?

06:18.470 --> 06:20.138
Investigators?
With all the recent cutbacks,

06:20.205 --> 06:22.574
we're lucky we still have guns.
Welcome to my world.

06:22.641 --> 06:24.442
Kevlar?
No way a vest

06:24.510 --> 06:27.145
would flatten a slug that much-
that's just freaky.

06:27.212 --> 06:28.913
Welcome to our world.

06:32.884 --> 06:34.051
Yeah.

06:36.287 --> 06:37.154
Hello?

06:43.561 --> 06:46.063
Aah! Aah!

06:46.131 --> 06:49.399
Aah!

07:00.340 --> 07:02.173
Claudia.

07:02.241 --> 07:05.075
Hey, Claudia!

07:05.142 --> 07:07.342
Jeez!

07:07.410 --> 07:09.545
Jeez, Leena.
Skulk much?

07:09.613 --> 07:11.483
Artie wants us to finish
putting these sensors up.

07:11.550 --> 07:13.951
Well,
I'm doing this instead.

07:16.721 --> 07:18.855
Okay, look.

07:18.923 --> 07:21.557
Do you want to just get it
off your chest right now?

07:21.625 --> 07:23.459
My chest is burden-less.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.963
Can't you tell
by reading my aura?

07:26.031 --> 07:28.131
I don't have to read
your aura

07:28.199 --> 07:29.966
to know that
you're pissed off at me.

07:30.034 --> 07:32.301
Going back to work now.

07:35.438 --> 07:42.548
âª âª

07:44.217 --> 07:46.320
Neighborhood watch
meets here once a week.

07:46.388 --> 07:48.622
Might be because
Loretta organized the group,

07:48.690 --> 07:50.791
and she makes
the best pies in the Midwest.

07:53.060 --> 07:54.425
Pete, he said pie.
I know.

07:54.493 --> 07:56.260
I just want to make sure

07:56.326 --> 07:57.592
everything's Jake
on the home front first.

07:57.660 --> 07:58.993
I'll be right there.

07:59.061 --> 08:00.627
Thank you.

08:00.695 --> 08:02.529
Look, all's I'm saying is

08:02.596 --> 08:06.131
you want to make an omelet,
you got to crack a few skulls.

08:06.199 --> 08:08.333
And I'm saying
there are other ways

08:08.401 --> 08:11.035
to keep this neighborhood safe
than vigilantism.

08:11.103 --> 08:12.937
Right, Sheldon?

08:13.005 --> 08:16.140
I've read that there are
two types of criminals-

08:16.208 --> 08:17.808
parasites and cowards.

08:17.876 --> 08:19.643
Amen, brother.

08:19.710 --> 08:21.277
Like that.

08:21.345 --> 08:23.479
Boom.

08:27.017 --> 08:28.450
What?

08:28.518 --> 08:30.452
Look, cranky's kind of

08:30.520 --> 08:31.987
your natural
state of being, isn't it?

08:32.054 --> 08:34.121
What, please?

08:34.188 --> 08:35.957
Three squashed bullets, okay?

08:36.024 --> 08:37.258
W- we think the artifact

08:37.325 --> 08:40.059
has some kind of
a bulletproof invulnerability.

08:40.128 --> 08:42.227
Yeah, no, that wouldn't
explain the hole in the wall.

08:42.296 --> 08:43.895
Well, what if whatever it is,

08:43.964 --> 08:45.264
it does a bunch
of different stuff?

08:45.332 --> 08:46.765
Doubtful.

08:46.833 --> 08:49.601
Okay. Well, maybe Claudia
can do a little,

08:49.669 --> 08:50.969
you know, tippy-typy-

08:51.037 --> 08:53.071
look, Pete,
could you just figure it out?

08:53.138 --> 08:54.939
You're a big kid now.
All right? I got to go.

08:55.007 --> 08:57.207
Okay, look, Artie, this is
a little too crotchety,

08:57.275 --> 08:58.642
even for you.

08:58.710 --> 09:00.010
What's going on?
I'm sorry, it's nothing.

09:00.078 --> 09:01.945
It's just
that I have a little...

09:02.012 --> 09:03.713
Rodent problem.

09:03.780 --> 09:06.081
Um, I'll have Claudia explore

09:06.149 --> 09:07.749
the invulnerability theory,
all right?

09:07.817 --> 09:10.485
<i>Gracias.</i>

09:10.553 --> 09:11.886
Hey.

09:11.954 --> 09:13.988
Detroit's almost finest.

09:14.056 --> 09:15.623
Officer Kessman...

09:15.690 --> 09:18.058
Large mochaccino
and a slice of Pumpkin to go?

09:18.126 --> 09:19.759
Ah, not today, Loretta.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.828
This is Agent Bering,
Secret Service.

09:21.896 --> 09:23.362
Hello.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.064
I'm her partner,
Agent Lattimer. Howdy.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.099
Is the President in town?

09:27.166 --> 09:29.133
No, no, we're just here
on a local matter,

09:29.201 --> 09:31.570
and we could use
the neighborhood watch's help.

09:31.637 --> 09:34.739
The authorities need our help?
That's not a good sign.

09:34.806 --> 09:36.073
Yeah.
Well, I have to run

09:36.141 --> 09:38.108
to the bank.

09:41.112 --> 09:43.546
I'll be right back,
but you can talk to Sheldon.

09:43.614 --> 09:44.948
He works with the watch.

09:45.015 --> 09:47.283
Two slices of the lemon meringue
for the Agents, please.

09:47.351 --> 09:48.685
Oh, you know what?
I'm more of a...

09:48.752 --> 09:50.653
Twizzlers gal myself,
but thanks.

09:50.721 --> 09:54.591
But, uh, I'll take her-
her slice.

09:54.658 --> 09:56.658
So what are you guys
looking for?

09:56.726 --> 09:58.125
Anything strange or unusual.

09:58.193 --> 09:59.423
Yes.

09:59.491 --> 10:00.991
You know, something that could...

10:01.059 --> 10:03.927
Twist a street lamp or...

10:03.995 --> 10:05.328
Put a hole through a brick wall.

10:05.396 --> 10:08.097
You see anything like that
that fits the bill?

10:08.165 --> 10:10.899
Uh, no. Sorry.
Haven't seen anything.

10:10.967 --> 10:12.133
But I'll definitely
keep my eye out.

10:12.701 --> 10:13.901
Okay, then.

10:13.968 --> 10:16.436
If you don't mind...

10:16.504 --> 10:19.071
My city needs me.

10:23.075 --> 10:24.008
You know, Dudley Do-Right
was first on the scene

10:24.076 --> 10:24.843
at all three locations.

10:24.911 --> 10:25.778
Yeah. He's also P.O.'d
about the cutbacks,

10:25.945 --> 10:28.079
and he likes to do things
his own way.

10:28.147 --> 10:30.548
Maybe he's doing things
his own way with an artifact.

10:30.615 --> 10:32.349
We should probably...
I think we should.

10:32.417 --> 10:34.150
Mm...

10:34.218 --> 10:36.318
Oh, uh, I'm gonna...

10:36.386 --> 10:38.020
Take these with me.

10:38.088 --> 10:39.087
Thank you so much.

10:51.598 --> 10:53.232
What do you think he's got?

10:53.300 --> 10:57.936
I don't know.
Wyatt Earp's badge, maybe?

10:58.004 --> 11:00.139
That's a good theory, Olivia.

11:00.207 --> 11:03.243
Olga. Oprah.

11:03.310 --> 11:04.411
Hey.

11:07.749 --> 11:10.350
Game on.

11:15.388 --> 11:17.322
I'm gonna go check out
the bedroom.

11:40.205 --> 11:41.938
Hey, up there-
the window's been broken.

11:45.941 --> 11:48.176
Freeze, Dirty Harry!
Surrender the artifact!

11:48.243 --> 11:50.679
Artifact?
What are you talking about?

11:50.746 --> 11:52.682
And what the hell
is that thing?

11:52.749 --> 11:54.551
What did you use to mop
the floor with these guys?

11:54.619 --> 11:56.854
I didn't do this.
Sure you didn't.

11:56.922 --> 11:59.090
We got an anonymous tip,
and I come run-

12:08.265 --> 12:10.466
No freakin' way!

12:10.534 --> 12:12.101
Help me! Please!

12:12.168 --> 12:14.269
Okay, just put him down
nice and slow.

12:14.337 --> 12:15.670
Aah! Aah!

12:15.738 --> 12:16.771
Whoa!

12:23.010 --> 12:26.245
Who was that masked man?

12:26.313 --> 12:29.281
That was no man.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.150
That was a superhero.

12:31.967 --> 12:35.967
<font color=#7fff00>âª Warehouse 132x02 âª</font> <font color=#ffff00>Mild
Mannered</font> <font color=#ffff00>Original Air Date on July 13, 2010</font>

13:05.595 --> 13:06.695
Pete, that was not
a superhero.

13:06.763 --> 13:09.465
No, that was
the Iron Shadow.

13:09.533 --> 13:11.434
The Iron Shadow?
Yeah.

13:11.501 --> 13:13.369
Only the most "awesomest"
character of the silver age.

13:13.437 --> 13:15.638
You grew up in a bookstore.
How do you not know that?

13:15.706 --> 13:17.339
Real books, not cartoons!

13:17.407 --> 13:19.241
Yeah, comic books!

13:21.645 --> 13:24.044
A guy in tights
just leaped over a building.

13:24.112 --> 13:26.346
Yeah, best to omit that
from your report.

13:26.413 --> 13:27.846
What report?

13:27.914 --> 13:30.046
All right.

13:30.114 --> 13:33.082
Okay, that mask he was wearing
looked kind of artifact-y.

13:33.149 --> 13:35.383
Maybe that's where he's
getting those powers from.

13:35.451 --> 13:37.085
No, the Iron Shadow
doesn't have powers.

13:37.153 --> 13:38.720
He's just a regular guy

13:38.787 --> 13:40.588
trained to be
the ultimate urban Samurai.

13:40.655 --> 13:42.556
Okay,
even ultimate urban Samurai

13:42.624 --> 13:44.825
can't leap over buildings, okay?

13:44.892 --> 13:47.460
Whoever that was has an artifact.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.194
We should have Claudia
check the Warehouse database.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.729
No need-
you're looking

13:50.796 --> 13:52.963
at a one-man
Iron Shadow encyclopedia.

13:53.030 --> 13:54.430
Pick an issue, any issue.

13:54.498 --> 13:57.698
I think we already know
your issues, okay?

13:57.766 --> 14:00.867
So officer Kessman said
he got an anonymous tip, right?

14:00.935 --> 14:03.269
I bet you dollars to doughnuts
where that call came from.

14:03.337 --> 14:05.572
Doughnuts or pies.

14:05.639 --> 14:07.640
Best in the Midwest.

14:07.708 --> 14:09.175
See, now I want doughnuts.

14:10.945 --> 14:12.410
Since when does
the Secret Service

14:12.478 --> 14:15.644
investigate petty crimes?
Just open the safe.

14:15.712 --> 14:18.115
Do you have any idea
what this woman

14:18.183 --> 14:19.817
means to this community?

14:19.884 --> 14:21.752
Sheldon, it's okay.
No, it's not.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.753
You go after good citizens
like Loretta?

14:23.821 --> 14:27.590
I was robbed at gunpoint
in my apartment.

14:27.657 --> 14:29.658
Bastards took my clothes,
my computer,

14:29.726 --> 14:31.393
my collection-everything.

14:31.461 --> 14:34.229
We all feel unsafe.

14:34.296 --> 14:38.065
We just want somebody
to do something about it.

14:44.639 --> 14:46.506
There...

14:46.574 --> 14:48.541
Knock yourselves out.

14:56.282 --> 14:59.318
What does this do?

14:59.385 --> 15:01.520
It's a key.

15:01.587 --> 15:03.555
It opens things.

15:08.495 --> 15:11.831
You, uh-you may want
to cover your eyes.

15:11.899 --> 15:13.833
No?

15:13.900 --> 15:15.134
Hmm.

15:24.043 --> 15:27.679
Nothing.

15:27.747 --> 15:30.082
Guess the Iron Shadow
doesn't use keys.

15:30.149 --> 15:32.150
Wait, the Iron Shadow?
Yeah.

15:32.218 --> 15:33.785
Like the comic book?

15:33.853 --> 15:36.254
Yeah, yeah, there's
some guy running around town.

15:36.321 --> 15:38.188
We're very sorry.

15:38.256 --> 15:40.457
Sorry to bother you.
Sorry.

15:40.525 --> 15:41.892
Sorry.
Thank you for your time.

15:41.959 --> 15:43.659
Thank you.
Bye.

15:47.497 --> 15:49.297
Hello, square one...

15:49.365 --> 15:50.833
We meet again.
Okay, okay.

15:50.901 --> 15:53.138
Let's just think
this through, okay?

15:53.206 --> 15:54.673
You're Joe Shmoe.

15:54.741 --> 15:56.975
You find an artifact
that gives you superpowers.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.544
What do you do?
I track down Ralph Brunsky

15:59.611 --> 16:01.612
and give him the mother
of all atomic wedgies

16:01.680 --> 16:04.714
in front of the entire
seventh-grade class.

16:04.782 --> 16:07.650
Or I don the guise of my
all-time favorite superhero

16:07.717 --> 16:09.584
and use my powers
to fight crime.

16:09.652 --> 16:11.386
Okay, okay.
So-so...

16:11.454 --> 16:15.289
Where does a person like you
hang out?

16:23.433 --> 16:24.834
Yeah!

16:24.901 --> 16:26.769
Okay.
Artifact City.

16:26.836 --> 16:29.772
No. Classic collectibles.
Potentially dangerous.

16:29.839 --> 16:33.344
You go talk to the owner.
I'm gonna do some research.

16:37.148 --> 16:39.382
Welcome to the Hairy Tarantula.

16:39.450 --> 16:40.884
How can I-
hey, I know you.

16:40.952 --> 16:43.888
Agent Bering.
Hi. What can I do you for?

16:43.955 --> 16:46.991
Earlier today
you were praising vigilantes.

16:47.058 --> 16:49.426
Are you aware
that someone in town

16:49.494 --> 16:50.694
is dressing up s a superhero

16:50.761 --> 16:52.061
and taking the law
into their own hands?

16:52.129 --> 16:53.863
Finally, someone's nutting up,

16:53.930 --> 16:55.163
showing the cops
how it's done.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.198
Yeah, well,
people are getting hurt.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.933
Yeah, who?
Scum of the earth?

16:59.001 --> 17:00.935
Boo-frakkin'- hoo.

17:01.003 --> 17:03.240
Who's this guy dressed up as,
so I can order more of that?

17:03.308 --> 17:05.809
Do you keep records
of your customers' purchases?

17:05.877 --> 17:07.510
Yeah.
I got a pull list. Why?

17:07.578 --> 17:09.211
I'm gonna need the names

17:09.279 --> 17:12.413
of anyone who's ever bought
Iron Shadow merchandise.

17:12.481 --> 17:14.113
I like a woman
who gives orders.

17:14.181 --> 17:17.181
Just get me the list.

17:19.215 --> 17:20.816
Hey.

17:20.883 --> 17:22.884
So is Brutus Beefcake our man?

17:22.952 --> 17:25.521
He wishes.
Did you find anything?

17:25.588 --> 17:27.324
I sure did.

17:27.391 --> 17:28.993
Issue 112.

17:29.060 --> 17:30.994
"The government
orders all superheroes

17:31.062 --> 17:32.396
"to reveal
their secret identities,

17:32.463 --> 17:35.531
"but the Iron Shadow
removes his mask for no man.

17:35.599 --> 17:37.600
So the Feds send out-"
I meant, um...

17:37.668 --> 17:39.401
With our case.
Oh.

17:39.469 --> 17:42.037
Mm-hmm.
No.

17:42.105 --> 17:44.873
So what's with the whole
underwear on the outside thing?

17:44.941 --> 17:46.674
They're called trunks.
Okay.

17:46.742 --> 17:49.444
I just never pegged you for
such a-what are they called?

17:49.511 --> 17:51.512
Fanboys?
Yeah, well, my sister

17:51.580 --> 17:53.948
got me hooked on comics
after my dad died.

17:54.016 --> 17:56.016
She thought it'd be
a good escape for me.

17:56.083 --> 17:58.651
<i>I've got every issue
of The Legendary Iron Shadow</i>

17:58.718 --> 18:01.252
except for number 46-
it's my white whale.

18:01.320 --> 18:02.920
Of course,
if my stuff never comes,

18:02.988 --> 18:04.622
I'll have to rebuild
my collection from scratch.

18:04.690 --> 18:05.890
It'll come.

18:05.958 --> 18:08.425
"There's only two types
of criminals-

18:08.493 --> 18:11.330
parasites and cowards. "

18:11.397 --> 18:15.637
Best mantra ever.

18:15.704 --> 18:18.472
Pete, I heard that today
in the coffee shop.

18:18.540 --> 18:20.641
What?

18:20.709 --> 18:23.076
Trade you
for your phone number.

18:23.144 --> 18:25.946
Okay. Here. Sheldon said
he lost his clothes,

18:26.013 --> 18:28.148
his computer,
and his collection.

18:28.215 --> 18:30.116
Good work, chum.
To the Batmobile.

18:33.254 --> 18:35.054
It's just a rental.

18:48.262 --> 18:51.763
No, no, no.
You're not the one doing this.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.933
Not doing what, Arthur?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.834
Artie.

18:56.902 --> 18:59.337
Not doing what?
Nothing.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.138
Nothing did anything.

19:01.206 --> 19:04.375
Artie, if there's something
wrong with the Warehouse,

19:04.443 --> 19:06.277
you should tell us.
All right, enough. Enough.

19:09.914 --> 19:12.014
MacPherson.

19:12.082 --> 19:14.183
I saw him.
MacPherson?

19:14.251 --> 19:17.319
Where?
The first time?

19:17.387 --> 19:19.087
By the Escher Vault.

19:19.155 --> 19:20.555
Shut up.

19:20.623 --> 19:22.390
So first, he blows up
the Warehouse,

19:22.457 --> 19:23.958
then he dies in it,
now he's haunting it?

19:24.025 --> 19:25.692
Dude, go into
the light already.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.060
No, no,
ghosts don't exist.

19:27.128 --> 19:29.228
They're just a manifestation
of a temporal-

19:29.296 --> 19:30.763
but the dead can rise again.

19:30.831 --> 19:33.966
Ugh! God, that vampire meme
is so aught-nine.

19:34.033 --> 19:35.968
Artie, are you sure
this isn't

19:36.035 --> 19:38.169
just a manifestation
of your own guilt?

19:38.237 --> 19:39.671
No, no, no.
I have no guilt.

19:39.739 --> 19:41.173
I tried to save his life.
He didn't want to be saved.

19:41.240 --> 19:42.507
No, no, no, this...

19:42.575 --> 19:44.542
This is something else.

19:44.610 --> 19:47.078
The accumulation of energy
within the Warehouse

19:47.145 --> 19:49.979
combined with-
see if we have this-

19:50.046 --> 19:52.613
combined with MacPherson's
psychic residue

19:52.681 --> 19:54.714
may have triggered an artifact

19:54.782 --> 19:57.916
in the vicinity
of the Escher Vault

19:57.984 --> 20:00.051
that projected an apparition.

20:01.687 --> 20:04.054
<i>Allons-y!</i>

20:04.122 --> 20:06.423
Rasputin's prayer PE?

20:06.491 --> 20:08.324
Would you do the honors?
Yeah.

20:10.061 --> 20:12.228
You think
I'm the Iron Shadow?

20:12.296 --> 20:13.696
I work in a coffee shop.

20:13.764 --> 20:15.865
By day, maybe,
but by night,

20:15.932 --> 20:19.501
you're using a power that's
beyond your comprehension.

20:19.569 --> 20:22.837
And maybe even
beyond your control.

20:22.905 --> 20:26.674
Look, I get it, man.
Okay?

20:26.742 --> 20:28.108
It makes you feel powerful,

20:28.176 --> 20:30.210
like you've just gone
from a 98-pound weakling

20:30.278 --> 20:31.545
to a badass overnight.

20:31.612 --> 20:32.912
But every artifact
has a downside,

20:32.980 --> 20:34.414
and people will get hurt.

20:34.481 --> 20:36.048
Yeah...

20:36.116 --> 20:37.182
The bad guys.

20:37.250 --> 20:39.651
Or somebody
that you care about...

20:39.719 --> 20:41.119
Like Loretta.

20:41.187 --> 20:42.888
You stay away from her!

20:46.423 --> 20:49.024
She doesn't know
anything about this.

20:51.694 --> 20:53.961
They attacked me...

20:54.028 --> 20:56.596
In my own home.

20:56.664 --> 20:58.097
You have no idea
what that is like.

20:58.165 --> 21:00.465
Actually, we kind of do.

21:00.533 --> 21:03.000
Sheldon, please...

21:03.068 --> 21:05.336
Just give us the artifact.

21:15.581 --> 21:17.382
Okay.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.685
I guess I knew
it was a bad idea.

21:19.753 --> 21:22.556
I'll just, uh, get it.
It's in there.

21:25.727 --> 21:28.730
Wow.

21:31.167 --> 21:33.068
What the hell?
Sheldon!

21:38.976 --> 21:41.345
God, don't superheroes
ever use stairs?

21:43.081 --> 21:45.683
Ooh, spidey sense
tingling.

21:45.750 --> 21:49.353
Uh, Pete, just how powerful
is this Iron Shadow?

21:49.421 --> 21:51.455
You mean like in a fight
with The Hulk, who would win?

21:51.523 --> 21:54.393
Okay, sure.
Well, The Hulk by a mile. Why?

21:54.460 --> 21:57.163
Um, yeah.

21:57.231 --> 21:59.466
I will save this city!

21:59.533 --> 22:02.468
I will make it safe for her.

22:02.536 --> 22:05.805
And no one
is going to stop me!

22:16.949 --> 22:18.650
Unh!
Oh, God.

22:18.653 --> 22:20.820
This is
your one warning!

22:20.888 --> 22:23.589
Get out of my city!

22:29.393 --> 22:31.227
Wow!

22:31.294 --> 22:32.361
Wow?

22:32.428 --> 22:35.029
This isn't a comic book, Pete.

22:35.053 --> 22:36.553
I mean, did you see
his hand tremors?

22:36.621 --> 22:38.288
Neurological damage.

22:38.356 --> 22:40.890
Could be a side effect
of molecular alteration.

22:40.957 --> 22:43.692
Okay, so Sheldon's
bulletproof one minute

22:43.759 --> 22:45.859
and then able to leap
tall buildings in a single bound

22:45.927 --> 22:47.227
the next because...

22:47.295 --> 22:48.962
Because he's altering
his density.

22:49.029 --> 22:51.997
With what?

22:52.064 --> 22:53.898
So this is
some kind of super gooer?

22:53.966 --> 22:57.200
This scrubber mollifies

22:57.268 --> 22:59.002
psychically triggered artifacts

22:59.069 --> 23:02.806
by really getting down
into those pesky,

23:02.873 --> 23:04.941
hard-to-reach pores.

23:05.009 --> 23:06.976
So that's how Rasputin

23:07.044 --> 23:09.112
survived all those
assassination attempts.

23:09.179 --> 23:10.580
Survived?
No, no, no.

23:10.648 --> 23:12.015
Nah, they got him
the very first try.

23:12.083 --> 23:13.751
No, the Romanovs
needed their enemies,

23:13.818 --> 23:15.351
the Bolsheviks, for example,

23:15.419 --> 23:17.853
to believe that the mad monk

23:17.921 --> 23:21.257
cheated death
over and over again.

23:21.325 --> 23:24.226
So what they did
was they resurrected Rasputin

23:24.294 --> 23:26.894
by using this prayer rope.

23:26.962 --> 23:28.462
It did not get rid
of the Bolsheviks,

23:28.530 --> 23:30.663
so the birth of Communism-
I hate this course.

23:30.731 --> 23:32.631
Oh. Sorry.

23:32.699 --> 23:34.099
So anyway, a good scrubbing

23:34.166 --> 23:36.367
should get rid of MacPherson.

23:46.741 --> 23:48.575
Ah!

23:56.983 --> 23:59.751
Okay.
Okay.

24:09.595 --> 24:10.428
Ew.

24:13.433 --> 24:14.966
This house...

24:15.034 --> 24:17.135
Is clean.

24:19.977 --> 24:22.015
James?

24:22.083 --> 24:22.983
<i>Do svidanya.</i>

24:23.050 --> 24:24.484
Ladies...

24:24.552 --> 24:26.315
As you were.

24:29.282 --> 24:31.817
Okay.

24:31.884 --> 24:34.052
Of all the people
you could have turned into,

24:34.120 --> 24:35.587
you picked me.

24:35.655 --> 24:37.623
I don't know-
I- I guess you were

24:37.690 --> 24:39.392
under some kind
of weird spell or something,

24:39.459 --> 24:40.860
but I can't help
feeling betrayed,

24:40.928 --> 24:42.194
because I almost lost

24:42.262 --> 24:44.531
the only real family
I've ever had,

24:44.598 --> 24:47.068
because you decided
to pick me.

24:48.004 --> 24:49.838
I didn't pick you.

24:49.905 --> 24:52.640
Can't you see
what MacPherson has done?

24:52.707 --> 24:55.308
He's turned us
all against each other.

24:55.376 --> 24:59.346
Artie? Artie's paranoid,
and you're suspicious.

24:59.414 --> 25:03.352
Without trust,
we're all vulnerable.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.389
And by the way,

25:05.457 --> 25:09.359
you're not the only one
who almost lost her family.

25:17.635 --> 25:20.903
Hey, Claud, I want to run
a theory by you-you busy?

25:20.971 --> 25:23.003
No. No.
No, I'm good to go.

25:35.145 --> 25:38.213
You can't be rid of me
that easily, Arthur.

25:40.816 --> 25:44.217
I will not let you win!

25:46.820 --> 25:48.120
Gold star
on the density altering.

25:48.188 --> 25:49.922
I ran it by grumpzilla.

25:49.990 --> 25:51.390
He pointed me to three items.

25:51.458 --> 25:53.793
Samson's jawbone,
Babe Ruth's bat,

25:53.861 --> 25:55.361
and Bruce Lee's
punching bag.

25:55.429 --> 25:57.230
But they're all here
in the Warehouse.

25:57.298 --> 25:58.531
What about belts?

25:58.599 --> 26:00.233
A- are there any belts?
What?

26:00.301 --> 26:01.668
Belts? Why belts?

26:01.735 --> 26:03.102
Well, the Iron Shadow's belt

26:03.170 --> 26:04.871
is made
of an indestructible metal

26:04.939 --> 26:06.606
that harnesses
his chakra energy.

26:06.674 --> 26:08.640
Ding, ding, ding!
There is, in fact, a belt

26:08.707 --> 26:11.175
that alters density and gives
the wearer super strength.

26:11.242 --> 26:13.610
Well, do we have it?
Alas, Jacob Kurtzberg's belt

26:13.678 --> 26:15.845
is not currently in stock.

26:15.913 --> 26:17.180
Jacob who?
Kurtzberg.

26:17.248 --> 26:19.249
Aka, Jack "The King" Kirby.
He created-

26:19.316 --> 26:20.883
comic book stuff.
Okay. Got it.

26:20.951 --> 26:22.251
So if Kirby's belt
is the artifact,

26:22.319 --> 26:23.953
how do we counter it?

26:24.020 --> 26:26.888
Artie had me categorizing
some old DARPA gak

26:26.956 --> 26:28.290
a couple weeks ago.

26:28.357 --> 26:29.957
Those guys were all about
super-sizing soldiers

26:30.025 --> 26:31.125
during the cold war.

26:31.193 --> 26:32.860
I'll dig in and holla back.

26:32.928 --> 26:35.863
Okay, so Sheldon
is unstable and dangerous,

26:35.930 --> 26:37.931
plus he already
considers us a threat.

26:37.999 --> 26:39.766
Which means we're gonna have
to play it by my book

26:39.834 --> 26:42.435
and not yours, so...

26:42.503 --> 26:44.301
If I were Lex Luthor...
Mm...

26:44.369 --> 26:46.604
I would go after the Man
of Steel's greatest weakness,

26:46.671 --> 26:47.938
which is...

26:48.006 --> 26:49.273
Kryptonite.

26:49.340 --> 26:51.675
No.

26:54.679 --> 26:55.946
Lois Lane.

27:00.784 --> 27:04.487
Loretta.

27:04.554 --> 27:06.689
Sheldon,
what are you doing here?

27:06.756 --> 27:08.557
Are you okay?
Do you feel safer now?

27:08.625 --> 27:10.792
You look terrible.
Here, sit down.

27:10.859 --> 27:13.864
Let me get you something.
You didn't answer my question.

27:13.932 --> 27:15.833
I- I don't understand.

27:15.900 --> 27:18.535
All I want is for you
to feel safe.

27:18.603 --> 27:22.506
Sheldon...

27:22.574 --> 27:26.209
I always feel safe with you.

27:26.277 --> 27:28.445
Really?
You do?

27:30.148 --> 27:32.549
Yes.

27:32.617 --> 27:35.185
I have to tell you something.
No, you don't.

27:35.253 --> 27:37.154
I already know.

27:37.222 --> 27:40.057
I can see it...

27:40.125 --> 27:41.725
In your eyes.

27:41.793 --> 27:44.395
I never could have hoped
for someone like you, Loretta.

27:47.965 --> 27:50.833
Not who I was before,
but now...

27:50.901 --> 27:53.802
Now things are different.

27:53.870 --> 27:56.272
What do you mean?
Different how?

27:56.340 --> 27:57.673
It's for you, Loretta.

27:57.741 --> 28:00.276
I'm doing this for you.

28:06.016 --> 28:08.550
I'm the Iron Shadow.

28:08.618 --> 28:11.285
Oh, my God.

28:11.353 --> 28:13.020
Sheldon...

28:15.190 --> 28:17.290
Okay, shadow-man,
hand it over.

28:17.358 --> 28:19.392
You two again.
We're here to help you.

28:19.460 --> 28:20.660
I don't need your help.

28:20.728 --> 28:22.729
Don't you see
the power I have?

28:22.796 --> 28:25.402
Dude, you have no idea
what you're messing with!

28:25.470 --> 28:27.107
No, you don't!

28:27.175 --> 28:29.676
Oh, here we go again!

28:31.445 --> 28:32.479
What's happening?

28:32.546 --> 28:34.514
Sheldon,
you have to stop that!

28:40.919 --> 28:43.686
I can't!
Sheldon?

28:43.754 --> 28:46.455
Are you all right?
No, Loretta, look out!

28:49.792 --> 28:51.992
No!

28:52.060 --> 28:53.860
I have to get out of here.

29:02.007 --> 29:04.375
Pete.
Hey.

29:05.464 --> 29:06.264
Is she okay?
Yeah, yeah.

29:06.353 --> 29:08.453
She'll-she'll be fine.
She just, uh...

29:08.521 --> 29:11.022
She just lost it there
for a second.

29:11.057 --> 29:11.337
Sheldon. Where-

29:11.405 --> 29:13.039
where's Sheldon?
I don't know.

29:13.107 --> 29:15.274
We need
to shut him down, asap.

29:15.342 --> 29:17.442
Please.
This isn't his fault.

29:17.510 --> 29:19.244
He's only doing this-

29:19.312 --> 29:22.347
for you.
He's in love with you.

29:25.051 --> 29:26.485
Talk to me.

29:26.553 --> 29:28.187
Good news!
I've got just the gizmo

29:28.255 --> 29:30.522
to counter
the Iron Shadow's powers.

29:30.590 --> 29:33.057
Yeah, well, the bad news is
you're in South Dakota.

29:33.125 --> 29:35.426
Have no fear...

29:35.493 --> 29:36.660
Claudia's here.
Nice.

29:36.728 --> 29:39.729
Whoa... Cozy.

29:39.797 --> 29:42.232
Don't fret.
Artie said it was okay.

29:42.299 --> 29:43.867
Well, what he actually
said was...

29:43.934 --> 29:46.202
Go, go!

29:46.270 --> 29:49.505
Plus, any excuse
to get away from Leena.

29:49.573 --> 29:52.107
So what do you got?
This.

29:52.175 --> 29:53.876
Absorbs all forms
of kinetic energy.

29:53.943 --> 29:55.711
Ooh.
A soldier takes 100 rounds

29:55.779 --> 29:57.914
to the chest per second
and doesn't break stride.

29:57.981 --> 29:59.182
Thinner than Kevlar,
way more resilient.

29:59.249 --> 30:02.018
And these puppies...

30:02.085 --> 30:03.552
What?

30:03.620 --> 30:05.254
A Claudia Donovan original.

30:05.322 --> 30:07.857
They channel the absorbed energy
from the suit

30:07.924 --> 30:09.925
and allow the wearer
to redirect it.

30:09.993 --> 30:12.794
<i>Irresistible force-
say Ni-hao</i>

30:12.862 --> 30:14.228
to immovable object.

30:14.296 --> 30:16.632
I am gonna get to play
a superhero in real life!

30:16.699 --> 30:17.833
Awesome!

30:17.901 --> 30:19.667
But there's a kink.

30:19.735 --> 30:21.336
The suit's
energy-siphoning abilities

30:21.404 --> 30:23.271
drain the wearer
of all vital fluids,

30:23.339 --> 30:24.873
causing paralysis
in 60 minutes.

30:24.941 --> 30:26.641
Oh, I'm only gonna need
60 seconds,

30:26.709 --> 30:29.511
'cause I'm gonna be all like
biff, bam, pow!

30:29.579 --> 30:32.781
And in men,
it causes impotence.

30:32.849 --> 30:34.315
Whoa.

30:34.383 --> 30:35.748
Here you go, Wonder Woman.

30:48.160 --> 30:50.393
Artie?
He won't leave me alone.

30:50.461 --> 30:52.594
Why can't I make him
leave me alone?

30:52.662 --> 30:55.096
It's not guilt.
It's not artifacts.

30:55.164 --> 30:57.632
I really have no idea
what the hell it is.

30:57.700 --> 31:00.335
Maybe you two aren't finished
with each other.

31:00.402 --> 31:02.103
Oh, please, I was finished
with James MacPherson

31:02.171 --> 31:03.971
15 years ago.

31:04.039 --> 31:06.841
You parted ways,
but you weren't finished.

31:06.909 --> 31:08.610
Artie, he was more
than your ex-partner.

31:08.678 --> 31:10.011
He was your friend

31:10.079 --> 31:12.647
you shared a connection
stronger than most people share

31:12.715 --> 31:13.849
in their whole life.

31:13.916 --> 31:15.617
Death-
we shared a death.

31:15.685 --> 31:17.853
I think that's what it is.
We shared a death.

31:17.921 --> 31:22.459
And we both rose
from the ashes, and...

31:22.527 --> 31:24.528
We were both brought back-
that's what it is.

31:24.595 --> 31:25.795
We were both brought back.
You think? I think.

31:25.863 --> 31:28.028
That's right.
We were both brought back.

31:28.096 --> 31:30.462
We shared a death, and that's
what we have in common.

32:09.632 --> 32:10.998
If we don't get that belt,

32:11.066 --> 32:12.599
those powers Sheldon has
could kill him.

32:12.667 --> 32:13.967
And not just him.

32:14.034 --> 32:15.868
With those gravitational waves
he's pulling in,

32:15.936 --> 32:18.770
he could pancake
an entire city block.

32:18.838 --> 32:20.037
That way.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.240
The factory.

32:24.308 --> 32:27.076
What? What's-
what's the factory?

32:27.143 --> 32:30.247
Before Sheldon was laid off,
he was an automotive engineer.

32:31.315 --> 32:34.150
He just goes there to think.

32:35.852 --> 32:37.988
Sheldon!

32:40.794 --> 32:42.362
Is this how you want it?

32:42.429 --> 32:46.565
All alone
in your Fortress of Solitude?

32:46.632 --> 32:48.733
We can help you.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.701
Help?

32:50.769 --> 32:53.537
You already made me
hurt Loretta!

32:53.604 --> 32:56.806
I had everything under control

32:56.874 --> 32:58.507
until you showed up.

32:58.575 --> 33:01.377
This guy's off the charts!
I know.

33:01.445 --> 33:04.747
We need to call out the big gun.
Come on!

33:06.416 --> 33:07.483
Myka!

33:27.934 --> 33:28.868
What are you doing?

33:28.935 --> 33:30.502
Sheldon!

33:30.570 --> 33:32.638
You're not the Iron Shadow!

33:32.705 --> 33:34.740
And we're not some
sinister government agents

33:34.807 --> 33:37.376
trying to stop you, okay?

33:37.443 --> 33:38.810
We're the good guys!

33:38.878 --> 33:40.612
And we're trying to help you,

33:40.680 --> 33:43.414
whether you want us to
or not.

33:43.482 --> 33:45.450
No, I don't want
to hurt anyone else.

33:45.517 --> 33:47.051
Then take my hands.

33:53.395 --> 33:55.362
Pete, come get the belt!

33:55.430 --> 33:58.266
Aah!

34:00.636 --> 34:01.836
I got it!

34:01.903 --> 34:05.371
Myka!
Use the gauntlets!

34:05.439 --> 34:07.139
Aah!

34:11.710 --> 34:12.909
Ah!

34:18.315 --> 34:19.547
Loretta!

34:19.616 --> 34:21.516
Thank God you're okay.
I'm so sorry.

34:21.583 --> 34:23.452
It's okay.
It's over.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.788
They got the belt.
Belt?

34:25.855 --> 34:26.987
What are you talking about?

34:29.792 --> 34:31.458
All right, that's troubling.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.962
If it's not the belt,
what is it?

34:34.029 --> 34:35.763
Help!
It's starting again.

34:35.831 --> 34:37.931
I can't get them off!

34:37.998 --> 34:41.967
Holy underwear.
It's the trunks!

34:42.034 --> 34:43.635
Loretta,
you have to get out of here.

34:43.702 --> 34:45.936
I can't control this anymore.
I won't leave you.

34:46.004 --> 34:47.504
Loretta, come on!
Sheldon!

34:47.572 --> 34:49.371
We have to go!

34:53.842 --> 34:56.443
Claudia!
What's happening?

34:56.511 --> 34:58.144
His mass keeps increasing!

34:58.212 --> 34:59.879
He's approaching
infinite density.

34:59.947 --> 35:01.548
Well, that sucks for him.

35:01.616 --> 35:03.050
Not just him, man!

35:03.118 --> 35:05.052
If Sheldon
collapses in on himself,

35:05.120 --> 35:06.919
he's gonna take
the whole city with him!

35:23.148 --> 35:26.283
Collapses in on himself...

35:26.351 --> 35:29.087
Like a-like a black hole?
Uh-huh.

35:29.154 --> 35:31.022
How do we stop that?

35:31.089 --> 35:32.924
You gotta siphon as much
of that gravitational energy

35:32.991 --> 35:34.726
as possible...

35:34.827 --> 35:36.561
And then get those trunks
off him!

35:36.629 --> 35:38.797
Just be careful-
your suit might not be able

35:38.865 --> 35:40.398
to absorb
another round of energy.

35:40.466 --> 35:41.733
We'll just wait
for ya here.

35:41.801 --> 35:44.035
Oh, thank you!

35:49.140 --> 35:50.273
Okay...

35:56.380 --> 35:59.315
Aah!

36:13.195 --> 36:15.196
Claudia, what's happening?

36:15.264 --> 36:16.564
The suit
has absorbed his power.

36:16.631 --> 36:17.998
We gotta break the circuit!

36:18.066 --> 36:19.666
We got to get
those trunks off of him!

36:19.734 --> 36:21.968
Aah!

36:27.707 --> 36:29.007
Pete!

36:39.550 --> 36:41.351
<i>Oy gevalt!</i>

36:41.419 --> 36:44.422
Myka, Myka.
Are you okay?

36:44.490 --> 36:45.590
Super.

36:53.866 --> 36:55.833
Is everyone...?

36:59.738 --> 37:02.374
My hero.

37:02.442 --> 37:05.177
I bought a bunch of stuff
at a yard sale

37:05.244 --> 37:06.878
to replace what I'd lost.

37:06.945 --> 37:10.882
The trunks were mixed in
with gym clothes.

37:10.950 --> 37:13.285
Till I put them on, I...

37:13.352 --> 37:15.653
Had no idea
they had such great power.

37:15.721 --> 37:18.757
Well, with great power
comes great responsibility.

37:21.794 --> 37:23.529
What, is that,
like, a thing or something?

37:25.532 --> 37:27.867
What?

37:27.934 --> 37:29.867
Maybe, uh...

37:32.304 --> 37:35.305
Maybe some identities
are best kept secret.

37:47.548 --> 37:49.982
Wait, hold up.
We're just gonna let him go?

37:50.050 --> 37:52.284
An artifact
took control of him,

37:52.352 --> 37:54.386
and he hurt somebody
that he loves.

37:54.453 --> 37:55.920
I mean,
these things happen.

37:55.988 --> 37:58.422
I think we can forgive that,
don't you?

38:00.625 --> 38:02.959
Yeah.
Yeah.

38:03.027 --> 38:04.828
I guess.
Yeah.

38:04.895 --> 38:06.362
And once again...

38:06.430 --> 38:09.465
The city is safe!

38:13.302 --> 38:15.469
Why is that so funny?

38:15.536 --> 38:17.437
That's what-
that's what they say.

39:03.774 --> 39:07.343
This used be
our house, James.

39:07.411 --> 39:11.581
I never wanted you gone.
I want you back.

39:11.649 --> 39:14.386
I miss my partner.

39:14.454 --> 39:18.590
And now, because of this...

39:18.658 --> 39:21.059
We're connected forever.

39:23.896 --> 39:25.464
Maybe you knew
that would happen.

39:25.531 --> 39:28.066
Maybe that's why
you put it in my pocket.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.002
Hmm?

39:45.246 --> 39:47.213
"Hello, Arthur.

39:47.280 --> 39:50.446
"If you're reading this,
it's probable that I'm gone.

39:50.513 --> 39:52.614
"Do you remember this watch?

39:52.682 --> 39:54.582
"We used to argue over it.

39:54.650 --> 39:56.784
"I think you should have it.

39:56.852 --> 39:59.019
"Good luck, old friend.

39:59.087 --> 40:02.122
I imagine
you're going to need it. "

40:02.190 --> 40:05.191
I suppose we could chat
from time to time...

40:05.259 --> 40:07.193
If that's even possi-

40:14.333 --> 40:17.334
or not.

40:25.243 --> 40:28.044
Hey, Leena.

40:28.112 --> 40:30.413
It could have
easily been me.

40:30.481 --> 40:32.916
MacPherson could have stuck
the pearl of wisdom in my ear

40:32.984 --> 40:35.352
and turned me
into his little stooge.

40:35.419 --> 40:37.387
Yes, he could have.

40:37.455 --> 40:39.055
He was a...

40:39.123 --> 40:42.158
Big, fat jerk who sucked.

40:42.226 --> 40:44.192
Thank you, Claudia.

40:44.260 --> 40:47.295
Hey, did Myka mention
the, uh...?

40:47.363 --> 40:48.730
Yeah. I'm just gonna
shelf this,

40:48.798 --> 40:50.231
and I'll meet you
over at the B&B.

40:50.266 --> 40:51.633
Rock on.

40:57.872 --> 41:00.807
Oh... Oh...

41:08.748 --> 41:11.883
Mrs. Frederic...

41:11.950 --> 41:13.985
Yo told me to let you know
if I...

41:14.052 --> 41:16.654
I experienced
anything strange.

41:21.208 --> 41:24.209
Oh, come on!
Just admit it was awesome!

41:24.277 --> 41:26.610
You know it was.
Okay, okay.

41:26.678 --> 41:29.546
I liked being
a superhero, okay?

41:29.613 --> 41:31.847
I mean, I got to kick ass
and save countless lives.

41:31.915 --> 41:33.982
Don't we kind of
do that here anyway?

41:34.050 --> 41:36.584
I suppose we do...
Odetta.

41:36.652 --> 41:38.886
Uh, Oona.
No, Oksana.

41:38.953 --> 41:42.388
It's Ophelia!
Okay?

41:42.456 --> 41:44.223
Like from Hamlet,
yes, Ophelia.

41:44.291 --> 41:47.192
Let the mocking commence.

41:47.259 --> 41:48.292
Ophelia?

41:48.360 --> 41:50.695
That's-
that's kind of...

41:50.763 --> 41:52.763
Beautiful.

41:52.831 --> 41:54.931
Can "Ophelia" boobies?
Oh!

41:54.999 --> 41:57.700
Snap!

41:57.768 --> 41:59.702
Okay, so-so you-

41:59.769 --> 42:02.237
still no word from-
about your stuff, right?

42:02.305 --> 42:04.405
Not a one, my Ophelia.

42:04.473 --> 42:06.607
Nay...

42:06.675 --> 42:08.141
Not a one.

42:08.209 --> 42:11.978
Well, come,
lowly roustabout.

42:13.447 --> 42:15.448
Yes, my darling, and all that.
Yes.

42:15.516 --> 42:17.517
Okay, keep going.
Keep going.

42:17.585 --> 42:18.852
Okay, stop.

42:18.920 --> 42:20.889
One, two, three.

42:20.956 --> 42:22.024
Ta-DA!

42:22.091 --> 42:25.261
Surprise!

42:25.329 --> 42:28.197
You guys!
It wasn't us.

42:28.264 --> 42:30.332
It was all Myka.
She totally masterminded it.

42:30.399 --> 42:32.368
Oh, you know,
it's just a distraction

42:32.435 --> 42:34.171
until your stuff arrives.

42:34.239 --> 42:36.675
But just in case it doesn't,

42:36.742 --> 42:40.846
then you can start to rebuild
your collection

42:40.914 --> 42:43.449
with this.

42:43.517 --> 42:47.420
Issue 46?
What, in mint condition?

42:47.488 --> 42:49.088
Do you know
how rare this is?

42:49.156 --> 42:50.256
Yeah.
Yeah, actually, I do.

42:50.324 --> 42:51.825
You have no idea
what I had to do

42:51.893 --> 42:53.326
to get my hands on that.

42:53.394 --> 42:56.063
This calls for cookies.
Oatmeal scotchies?

42:56.131 --> 42:57.732
Please? Please?
Uh...

42:57.799 --> 42:59.901
I have to apologize.

42:59.969 --> 43:01.502
I've been
extremely distracted,

43:01.569 --> 43:04.568
and I'm back now.
I'm back 100%.

43:04.636 --> 43:06.436
100%, huh?

43:06.504 --> 43:08.836
Yeah. 120%, all right?
Give me that.

43:08.904 --> 43:10.471
Saving your life.

43:10.539 --> 43:12.840
Okay, I'd be distracted too
if a ghost was chasing me.

43:12.908 --> 43:14.274
No, no. How many times
do I have to articulate this?

43:14.342 --> 43:15.675
Ghosts do not exist.

43:15.743 --> 43:17.443
What fools attribute
to the phenomenon of ghosts

43:17.511 --> 43:19.045
actually-
oh, my God, make it stop!

43:19.112 --> 43:21.313
Not yet. I'm someone
who's trying to enlighten you.

43:21.381 --> 43:24.016
So do you think
this feels more like home now?

43:24.083 --> 43:26.284
Nah.

43:26.352 --> 43:28.119
It's better.
