00:23.243 --> 00:26.028
my recreation league angel,
Gene Belcher!

00:35.112 --> 00:36.186
They're baseball pants.

00:36.187 --> 00:37.802
Well, they go great with this top.

00:37.803 --> 00:39.403
It's also called a jersey, Gene.

00:39.404 --> 00:40.404
No.

00:40.405 --> 00:42.406
Ease up, everybody, back off.

00:42.407 --> 00:44.692
It's his first game.
Oh! This is so exciting!

00:44.693 --> 00:46.861
I'll show you exciting. Hi-ya!

00:46.862 --> 00:48.195
I've got armor for my ding-dong!

00:48.196 --> 00:50.064
Come on. That's not how
you hit a crotch

00:50.065 --> 00:52.032
with a baseball bat.

00:52.033 --> 00:55.569
<i>This</i> is how you hit a crotch
with a baseball bat. (grunts)

00:55.570 --> 00:57.805
Ha-ha-ha! What doesn't break
my testicles

00:57.806 --> 00:59.724
only makes them stronger!

00:59.758 --> 01:01.659
Wow, Gene is really athletic.

01:01.660 --> 01:03.027
I love baseball:

01:03.028 --> 01:04.812
The pizza parties, the spiky shoes,

01:04.813 --> 01:06.831
the parade at the end of the season

01:06.832 --> 01:08.249
where we ride on a float.

01:08.250 --> 01:09.250
How's my wave?

01:09.251 --> 01:12.253
- Hi...
- Hi...

01:12.254 --> 01:14.722
Hey, Teddy, do you want
an espresso before we close up?

01:14.756 --> 01:16.507
A what?
An espresso. Huh?

01:16.508 --> 01:18.008
Whoa, look at that.

01:18.009 --> 01:20.211
Yeah, it was a little pricey,

01:20.212 --> 01:21.829
but it's an investment, right?

01:21.830 --> 01:23.564
Someone comes in for a burger,

01:23.565 --> 01:25.566
they'll say, "Oh, Bob, finally

01:25.567 --> 01:27.034
you're selling espresso."

01:27.035 --> 01:28.903
Oh, Bobby, it's like
that hot plate you bought.

01:28.904 --> 01:29.937
You had big dreams for that.

01:29.938 --> 01:31.372
Where is it now?

01:31.373 --> 01:33.557
It's right there.
Oh. Ow, it's hot.

01:33.558 --> 01:34.592
Teddy, why don't you try one?

01:34.626 --> 01:35.926
It's on the house.
Nah.

01:35.927 --> 01:37.428
Well, just to see if you like it.

01:37.429 --> 01:38.896
I don't wanna, Bob.
I'm declining politely.

01:38.897 --> 01:40.097
Just take one shot, Teddy!

01:40.098 --> 01:41.966
I don't like those tiny cups!

01:41.967 --> 01:44.251
Just drink one! They make it
look like I have giant hands!

01:44.286 --> 01:45.402
Come on!

01:45.403 --> 01:47.138
Leave me alone!
Oh, fine.

01:47.139 --> 01:49.023
Really? You're gonna give up
that easy?

01:49.024 --> 01:52.743
Well, if no one's gonna drink
this, maybe I'll just...

01:52.744 --> 01:54.745
Ugh, that's terrible.

01:54.746 --> 01:56.797
That's... that's...

01:58.216 --> 02:00.468
Ooh...

02:00.469 --> 02:02.386
Ah...

02:02.387 --> 02:04.972
Ooh...

02:06.057 --> 02:07.475
Ooh, ah...

02:07.476 --> 02:09.759
Oh... ooh...

02:14.265 --> 02:15.282
Hey, Tina.

02:15.283 --> 02:16.817
- Hi, Teddy.
- Hi.

02:16.818 --> 02:18.736
Uh...

02:21.323 --> 02:23.057
Huh.

02:23.058 --> 02:24.892
Gross, right?
Yeah, it's an acquired taste...

02:24.893 --> 02:26.594
that I just acquired.

02:26.628 --> 02:28.963
Hey, batter, batter, batter,
hey, batter, batter, batter,

02:28.964 --> 02:30.464
hey, batter, batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter,

02:30.465 --> 02:31.966
hey, hey, hey, hey!

02:31.967 --> 02:34.034
UMPIRE: Strike three!
You're out. Ha-ha!

02:34.069 --> 02:35.836
I made that kid strike out.

02:35.837 --> 02:37.304
<i>I</i> did that!
I'm part of this!

02:37.305 --> 02:39.290
Which one's yours?

02:39.291 --> 02:41.809
Oh, he's down there in
the dugout entertaining the troops.

02:41.843 --> 02:43.477
Normal Gene.
Evil Gene.

02:43.478 --> 02:45.665
Normal Gene. <i>Evil</i> Gene.
(grunts)

02:45.680 --> 02:48.015
I think I can hear my hair
growing, especially the bangs.

02:48.016 --> 02:49.850
Hey, maybe that's why
they call them bangs.

02:49.851 --> 02:52.135
Hey, keep it down.
How many espressos have you had?

02:52.136 --> 02:54.522
Just one. I'm being really
interesting right now, I can tell.

02:54.523 --> 02:56.093
Usually my personality
is a little flat.

02:56.124 --> 02:57.691
Did you ever pick up on that?

02:57.692 --> 02:59.176
That you have a personality? No.

02:59.177 --> 03:00.211
How we doing, Coach?

03:00.212 --> 03:01.612
Have you played all your kids?

03:01.613 --> 03:03.464
Uh, yeah, I think I got 'em all.

03:03.465 --> 03:05.099
Pretty much.
Yeah, I got 'em all.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.117
Yeah, I think, I think so, yeah.
What about

03:07.118 --> 03:09.453
Belly Bongo? Come on.
I played my girl. I'm a boy.

03:09.454 --> 03:11.455
You got to play Belly Bongo, Coach.

03:11.456 --> 03:13.357
(sighs) All right, Gene, you're in.

03:13.358 --> 03:14.358
What <i>about</i> urine?

03:14.359 --> 03:15.359
Grab a bat.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.844
Done. Now what?

03:16.878 --> 03:18.445
Sometimes with Jimmy Jr.,
I don't know what to say.

03:18.446 --> 03:20.214
But now I don't know
what <i>not</i> to say.

03:20.215 --> 03:21.782
I have all these thoughts,
and it's like, "Okay, guys,

03:21.783 --> 03:23.217
who can get to my mouth first?"

03:23.218 --> 03:25.052
I think I love Espresso Tina.

03:25.053 --> 03:26.871
Thanks. I think
Jimmy Jr. will, too.

03:26.872 --> 03:29.023
Oh, Gene's going up to bat! Yay!

03:29.024 --> 03:30.808
Go, Gene, go! Whoo!

03:30.809 --> 03:32.843
Why does he have to play now?
The game's tied.

03:32.844 --> 03:35.179
Gene doesn't even thrive
under <i>no</i> pressure.

03:35.213 --> 03:38.699
Okay, just roll it at me
as slowly as you feel like.

03:39.367 --> 03:41.185
Oh, God.

03:41.186 --> 03:42.686
Aah! Strike one, strike
two, strike three!

03:42.687 --> 03:43.954
I surrender!

03:43.989 --> 03:45.522
He's a, a little
tentative out there.

03:45.523 --> 03:47.758
He kind of got
a piece of it, right?

03:47.759 --> 03:49.476
Not really.
No, no, he didn't.

03:51.179 --> 03:53.330
(screams)

03:56.699 --> 03:57.718
(bat smacks)

04:03.241 --> 04:04.575
(grunts)

04:04.576 --> 04:06.076
Ow!
(panting)

04:08.330 --> 04:10.915
It's not your fault
you lost, sweetie.

04:10.916 --> 04:12.333
It's his fault.

04:12.334 --> 04:15.252
Hey! Button it,
you seventh inning bi...

04:15.253 --> 04:17.553
Oh, Gene, oh, you played!
Wasn't it fun?

04:17.589 --> 04:19.356
I hate baseball! I hate it!

04:19.391 --> 04:20.724
(grunting)

04:20.759 --> 04:21.892
Gene, wait!

04:21.892 --> 04:23.716
(grunts) Oh, nice slide, honey!

04:24.284 --> 04:26.560
LINDA: It's not that bad, Gene.

04:26.561 --> 04:27.794
You made some errors,
you struck out,

04:27.829 --> 04:29.563
one or two people booed.

04:29.564 --> 04:31.531
Louise. To be fair, I also laughed.

04:31.566 --> 04:33.066
That's it!
I'll never set foot

04:33.067 --> 04:35.023
on a baseball field again
except as a streaker!

04:35.024 --> 04:36.136
I quit!

04:36.170 --> 04:37.904
If you quit, you'd be a quitter.

04:37.905 --> 04:39.573
That's worse than being a loser.

04:39.574 --> 04:41.541
Well, let's not dismiss
the quitting idea.

04:41.542 --> 04:42.643
- Bob!
- What?

04:42.644 --> 04:44.411
It has a quiet dignity to it.

04:44.412 --> 04:46.913
Quiet dignity?
Have you met us?!

04:46.914 --> 04:48.848
Uh, Bob, what's
the Burger of the Day?

04:48.849 --> 04:50.684
I'm looking at an empty
chalkboard here.

04:50.685 --> 04:52.202
Well, it's something
with gouda cheese.

04:52.203 --> 04:54.854
I'm still trying to come up
with a name for it.

04:54.855 --> 04:56.239
Woulda Coulda Gouda.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.908
You Gouda Be Kidding Me.
As Gouda As It Gets.

04:57.909 --> 04:59.359
Gouda Gouda Gumdrops.
A Few Gouda Men.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.527
Gouda Gouda Two Shoes...
comes with shoes.

05:00.528 --> 05:01.862
Gouda Day, Sir.

05:01.863 --> 05:03.664
Uh, Tina, no more espresso for you.

05:03.698 --> 05:05.865
There goes Jimmy Jr.

05:05.866 --> 05:08.669
Hey, Jimmy Jr., I see
you're riding a bicycle.

05:08.703 --> 05:10.870
Do you know they call it
a bicycle because "bi" means two?

05:10.871 --> 05:12.539
Speaking of two, there's two of us.

05:12.540 --> 05:15.092
Do you want to go on a date,
by the way? Uh, okay.

05:15.093 --> 05:16.927
What's good for you?
How about tomorrow at 5:00 a.m.?

05:16.928 --> 05:19.212
I know I'll be up.
Uh...

05:19.213 --> 05:21.231
Great. So it's a date. I'll see
you then. We'll get coffee.

05:21.232 --> 05:22.699
Oops, wrong way.
Eh...

05:22.734 --> 05:25.068
We're gonna turn
this sinking ship around.

05:25.069 --> 05:26.870
You just need
a little extra coaching.

05:26.871 --> 05:29.006
Right, Bob? Bob?

05:29.007 --> 05:30.007
Huh?

05:30.041 --> 05:31.241
Coaching. A little extra coaching.

05:31.242 --> 05:33.176
- In?
- Baseball!

05:33.177 --> 05:34.378
- From?
- You!

05:34.379 --> 05:36.046
Oh! Right.
For Gene. Sure.

05:36.047 --> 05:37.080
Yes, you.

05:37.081 --> 05:38.548
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Ah...

05:38.549 --> 05:40.684
I probably should
have been playing catch

05:40.685 --> 05:43.320
with you for years.
Then you'd be good at it.

05:43.354 --> 05:46.256
It's so beautiful here.
Dad, is this Heaven?

05:46.257 --> 05:48.191
It's not Heaven, but the, but
the lighting is nice, right?

05:48.192 --> 05:49.359
It's a nice time of day.

05:49.394 --> 05:51.862
You know, when I saw you
playing the game,

05:51.863 --> 05:53.296
it looked to me like you were

05:53.297 --> 05:54.598
a little afraid of the ball.

05:54.599 --> 05:56.600
The stitches remind me
of Frankenstein!

05:56.601 --> 05:58.702
All right, I'm gonna toss it
to you easy, Gene, okay?

05:58.736 --> 06:00.003
It's getting hard to see,

06:00.038 --> 06:01.588
so let me know when
you throw it. Uh-oh.

06:01.589 --> 06:03.571
Oh! You hit me in the nose!

06:03.591 --> 06:05.599
I'm sorry! I said
I was gonna throw it.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.610
(groans)

06:06.611 --> 06:08.528
Here, you can have
a free throw at me.

06:08.563 --> 06:10.745
Ow! I thought you couldn't throw!

06:10.748 --> 06:12.914
I was aiming at your feet!

06:12.933 --> 06:15.000
Ow! Stop it, Gene!

06:15.002 --> 06:16.543
That time I aimed at your face!

06:16.571 --> 06:19.139
All right, how about this?
(grunts)

06:19.173 --> 06:21.575
(both grunting)

06:21.609 --> 06:23.243
Aah! Don't throw that!

06:23.244 --> 06:24.778
Do not throw that!

06:24.779 --> 06:26.613
Hey, look at this.

06:26.614 --> 06:28.615
I Yahoogled
"boy needs baseball help,

06:28.616 --> 06:32.052
father-son fail unathletic
hopeless turquoise jewelry."

06:32.086 --> 06:33.253
Why turquoise jewelry?

06:33.254 --> 06:34.788
'Cause I've been looking for some.

06:34.789 --> 06:36.056
It's coming back.
Anyway,

06:36.090 --> 06:37.958
look what came up.
"The Deuce of Diamonds' Diamonds

06:37.959 --> 06:39.726
in the Rough in the Diamond
Baseball Camp."

06:39.761 --> 06:42.312
It's rated four diamonds!

06:42.313 --> 06:43.914
Hello there, ballers.

06:43.915 --> 06:45.549
I'm the Deuce of Diamonds!

06:45.583 --> 06:47.651
Hey, I know him. He used to be
the Prince of Persuasia.

06:47.652 --> 06:49.186
The Prince of whosia?

06:49.187 --> 06:50.854
A teacher of the ancient
art of seduction.

06:50.855 --> 06:52.689
Dr. Yap had his video.
I learned so much.

06:52.690 --> 06:54.257
But now I have something better,
a magic black bean.

06:54.258 --> 06:56.126
- A what?
- Nothing.

06:56.127 --> 06:58.995
What's holding you back from
maximum baseball excellence?

06:58.996 --> 07:00.814
Guess what was standing in my way.

07:00.815 --> 07:02.783
<i>I</i> was.

07:02.817 --> 07:04.785
Wow, that's deep.

07:04.786 --> 07:05.919
- Deeply dumb.
- Shh!

07:05.953 --> 07:08.321
I was striking <i>myself</i> out.

07:08.322 --> 07:10.991
Then I unlocked the baseball
awesomeness inside my body.

07:10.992 --> 07:12.859
Now look at me.

07:12.894 --> 07:14.428
He didn't do that.

07:14.462 --> 07:16.129
Check out these incredible results

07:16.130 --> 07:17.898
from my one-day Diamonds
in the Rough

07:17.899 --> 07:19.366
in the Diamond Baseball Camp.

07:25.973 --> 07:27.174
Now he's Deucing it.

07:33.047 --> 07:35.038
Now they're all Deucing it.

07:35.049 --> 07:36.983
Ooh, look at this.

07:36.984 --> 07:39.820
The Deuce is holding
his camp in town tomorrow!

07:39.821 --> 07:41.471
And it's only $495.

07:41.472 --> 07:44.541
$495 for that? That's crazy.

07:44.542 --> 07:47.310
For that kind of money,
he should throw in $495.

07:47.311 --> 07:50.747
Don't be a cheapskate, Bob.
Do you love Gene or not?

07:50.748 --> 07:52.716
Of course I love Gene.
Ew!

07:52.717 --> 07:54.484
Then we're spending $495.

07:54.485 --> 07:55.652
We don't have it!

07:55.653 --> 07:57.477
Oh, go fart in a fortune cookie.

07:57.505 --> 08:01.675
No fair! I can't have
$495, but Tina can have

08:01.676 --> 08:04.077
all the glasses she wants?! Ugh!

08:04.078 --> 08:05.378
Let's discuss this
over a frothy espresso.

08:05.379 --> 08:07.047
I'll go make it.

08:07.048 --> 08:09.366
No more espresso, Tina.
I'm gonna lock her in her room.

08:09.367 --> 08:10.634
TINA: No.

08:10.668 --> 08:12.385
Ah, maybe I could sell
something valuable.

08:12.386 --> 08:15.121
I got a Spanish edition of
<i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>

08:15.122 --> 08:17.958
I found on a bus.
<i>Cincuenta Sombras de Grey.</i>

08:17.959 --> 08:19.226
Don't tell your father.

08:19.227 --> 08:22.062
You could sell your soul.
I did, and look at me,

08:22.063 --> 08:24.064
<i>I'm</i> fine.

08:24.065 --> 08:27.934
(gasps) I have something more
precious than my soul.

08:27.935 --> 08:30.871
LINDA: <i>And this one
and this one. Good-bye.</i>

08:30.905 --> 08:32.739
Ooh, and this one.
Okay.

08:32.740 --> 08:34.573
Bye-bye. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, okay.

08:34.575 --> 08:36.142
And this one. Oh, no-no-no,
not that one. Not that.

08:36.143 --> 08:37.811
I don't know how that got in there.

08:37.812 --> 08:39.092
Okay. Wait, wait. A couple more.

08:39.113 --> 08:41.982
Bye. Go. Okay.
Look, I need $495.

08:41.982 --> 08:43.450
Plus that derringer.

08:43.484 --> 08:45.285
Look, the kitsch craze
is kind of played out.

08:45.286 --> 08:46.419
No one likes babies.

08:46.454 --> 08:47.921
What? Who doesn't? What?

08:47.955 --> 08:49.389
I got a shelf of 'em.

08:49.390 --> 08:51.491
Oh! Look at that one!
Let me see that one!

08:51.492 --> 08:52.592
(clears throat) Uh, Mom.

08:52.627 --> 08:54.661
What? Oh.

08:54.662 --> 08:56.596
Going in the wrong
direction. I'm sorry.

08:56.597 --> 09:00.066
Maybe if you had some fine art
or antique coins or firearms.

09:00.101 --> 09:02.969
- Or high-end restaurant equipment?
- Talk to me.

09:02.970 --> 09:04.804
What about the...?

09:04.805 --> 09:06.640
(gasps) Ah...

09:06.641 --> 09:10.677
(grunts) Stealing and pawning.
I feel so dirty!

09:10.678 --> 09:13.146
I told you you'd like crime, Mom.

09:13.147 --> 09:14.818
Eh... yeah, I do.

09:16.039 --> 09:18.687
Wounder why dad changes
his mind about me going

09:18.688 --> 09:19.988
to the Deuce of Diamonds'
Baseball Camp?

09:19.989 --> 09:21.757
Well, because he loves you.

09:21.758 --> 09:23.859
But you don't let him know
that you know, all right?

09:23.860 --> 09:25.761
He doesn't like to talk
about his feelings.

09:25.762 --> 09:28.497
He's all stunted inside like
a big dumb man, all right?

09:28.498 --> 09:30.082
It's our little secret, okay?

09:30.083 --> 09:31.700
Just like our Sunday mani-pedis.

09:31.701 --> 09:34.470
Oh, look, there he is!
Hi, The Deuce. This is Gene.

09:34.471 --> 09:36.939
I've got the heart
of a baseball player

09:36.940 --> 09:39.508
but the body of a manager.
Office manager.

09:39.509 --> 09:41.310
No problem, that's
what we're here for.

09:41.311 --> 09:43.345
Baseball is all I do.

09:43.346 --> 09:45.781
<i>The Closer of Close-Up Magic.</i>
Don't worry about that.

09:45.782 --> 09:47.683
<i>The Iceman of Inkjet
Printer Repair?</i>

09:47.684 --> 09:49.618
Those are just...
in my trunk.

09:49.619 --> 09:50.853
Now, about the tuition...

09:50.854 --> 09:52.971
Ah! It wasn't easy,
but I got it all.

09:52.972 --> 09:54.439
Great, cash!

09:54.440 --> 09:56.041
I mean, checks are so formal.

09:56.042 --> 09:57.442
It's a lot of money.

09:57.443 --> 09:59.111
But you guarantee
results, right, Deuce?

09:59.112 --> 10:01.113
You better write your name
on this little guy because

10:01.114 --> 10:03.048
you're not gonna recognize him
when you pick him up.

10:03.049 --> 10:05.684
Ha-ha! I'm gonna have
a killer fastball

10:05.685 --> 10:06.852
and a magnificent perm.

10:06.853 --> 10:08.387
Whoo! I'm gonna have a hot dog.

10:10.123 --> 10:11.990
Hey-hey-hey, Jimmy Pesto!

10:11.991 --> 10:13.525
Hi, Linda.
Thanks for the heads up

10:13.526 --> 10:14.526
about the baseball camp.

10:14.527 --> 10:15.827
Isn't it great?

10:15.828 --> 10:17.362
Last chance to earn my love, guys.

10:17.397 --> 10:19.798
(laughs) I love that joke.

10:19.799 --> 10:22.201
Okay, guys, let's get started.
I'm gonna count these checks,

10:22.202 --> 10:24.036
and you guys are gonna
inject yourself

10:24.037 --> 10:26.889
with some performance-enhancing
enthusiasm!

10:26.890 --> 10:28.707
ALL: Yay!

10:28.708 --> 10:30.158
I am going to be athletic.

10:30.159 --> 10:31.527
How you doing, Tina?
You seem a little logy.

10:31.528 --> 10:32.728
Well, you seem a
little shut your face.

10:32.729 --> 10:34.496
- Whoa.
- Tina!

10:34.497 --> 10:36.832
It's her first day since
I cut her off espresso, so...

10:36.833 --> 10:38.500
Yeah, when you dance with the bear,

10:38.501 --> 10:41.236
you can't stop until
the bear wants to stop.

10:41.237 --> 10:42.738
Espresso's the bear. Come on, Dad.

10:42.739 --> 10:44.573
Just let me bite down on a bean!

10:44.574 --> 10:46.041
No! No espresso!

10:46.042 --> 10:48.110
You can't have any and your
father can't sell any.

10:48.111 --> 10:50.612
And, uh, I mean, he's allowed
to, he just never, ever will.

10:50.613 --> 10:51.780
So end of subject.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.348
Uh, ooh, look at the sky.

10:53.349 --> 10:54.917
You know what?
I've been thinking about it.

10:54.918 --> 10:56.585
Maybe I should try it.
Broaden my horizons.

10:56.586 --> 10:57.853
No, don't!

10:57.854 --> 10:59.738
I-I saw a report.
It'll shrink your penis.

10:59.739 --> 11:01.073
Yeah, it'll shrink it.

11:01.074 --> 11:03.425
One study says it'll shrink,
the other says it'll grow.

11:03.426 --> 11:04.893
You got to just live your life.

11:04.894 --> 11:05.894
Set me up, Bob.

11:05.895 --> 11:06.929
My first sale.

11:06.930 --> 11:08.764
(Linda groans)

11:08.765 --> 11:11.266
We never thought
he'd actually sell one.

11:11.267 --> 11:13.902
I just got to take off the dust
cover. Take off that dust cover.

11:13.903 --> 11:16.939
(Bob and Tina screaming)
Where is it?!

11:16.940 --> 11:18.440
Oh, my God, it's gone.

11:18.441 --> 11:19.775
Oh, how odd.

11:19.776 --> 11:21.043
Okay, guys, listen up.

11:21.044 --> 11:22.611
Your glove is your best friend.

11:22.612 --> 11:24.713
But you are not its best friend.

11:24.714 --> 11:26.598
You're its boss
and you are pissed off.

11:26.599 --> 11:27.882
Now punish your glove.

11:27.883 --> 11:30.936
Pound it. Make it afraid
to miss a ball ever.

11:30.937 --> 11:33.555
(grunting)

11:33.556 --> 11:36.608
You've got to start meeting
your performance goals!

11:36.609 --> 11:39.378
When you change your attitude,
you change your batitude.

11:39.379 --> 11:40.746
So swing away.

11:40.780 --> 11:43.282
Uh, Mr. The Deuce,
you don't have a baseball.

11:43.316 --> 11:44.483
If we played with a real ball,

11:44.484 --> 11:46.451
we'd spend half the day
running after it.

11:46.452 --> 11:47.953
It's all in your mind.

11:47.987 --> 11:49.121
- Whoa.
- Wow.

11:49.155 --> 11:50.706
(whooshing) (hitting noise)

11:50.740 --> 11:52.641
That's a double in the gap.
(chuckles)

11:52.642 --> 11:53.942
(whooshing) (hitting noise)

11:53.943 --> 11:55.978
- Home run.
- Ooh!

11:55.979 --> 11:58.297
(hitting noise) Broken bat, single.

11:58.298 --> 11:59.298
(gasps)

11:59.299 --> 12:01.566
I'll need a pinch runner.

12:01.567 --> 12:03.969
What's that, kid? (wheezing): I
said I'm gonna need a pinch runner.

12:04.003 --> 12:05.837
Speak up, please.
(wheezing)

12:05.838 --> 12:07.306
(whooshing) (hitting noise)

12:07.307 --> 12:09.341
Long fly ball. This could go.

12:09.342 --> 12:11.276
Oh, no, caught at the wall.

12:11.311 --> 12:12.477
No!

12:12.512 --> 12:14.696
By you. You hit it, you caught it.

12:14.697 --> 12:16.431
Amazing over-the-shoulder catch.

12:16.466 --> 12:18.767
I was robbed. By me.

12:18.768 --> 12:21.169
An espresso machine
doesn't just walk away.

12:21.170 --> 12:23.622
Where are you, you big,
beautiful silver bastard?

12:23.656 --> 12:24.994
Who would do this?
(door chimes ring)

12:25.024 --> 12:26.663
Hi, Tina.
What, what,

12:26.693 --> 12:28.827
what?! I just... I was saying hi.

12:28.828 --> 12:30.667
'Cause I just walked in, so...

12:30.697 --> 12:34.016
what do you mean, what? Oh, my God,
I never noticed how annoying you are.

12:34.017 --> 12:35.517
I can't even understand
what you're saying.

12:35.551 --> 12:37.352
Oh, I have
a speech impediment, Tina.

12:37.387 --> 12:38.503
Well, fix it.

12:38.538 --> 12:40.339
Hey, where's Gene?
Ah, Gene, Gene, Gene.

12:40.340 --> 12:41.773
That's all you ever talk about.

12:41.774 --> 12:43.175
What about me?
Look at me.

12:43.176 --> 12:44.443
Gene's at that baseball thing.

12:44.444 --> 12:45.977
My brothers are there, too.

12:45.978 --> 12:47.646
What?!
Oh, that's right.

12:47.647 --> 12:49.348
Uh, Gene's at, uh...

12:49.349 --> 12:51.371
(mumbling): Deuce of
Diamonds' Baseball Camp.

12:51.372 --> 12:52.517
Playing baseball.

12:52.568 --> 12:53.702
(panting)

12:53.703 --> 12:56.338
Okay, cross home.
Tip your cap.

12:56.339 --> 12:58.006
Chest bump the guy on deck,

12:58.007 --> 13:00.208
and that's a home run ot.

13:00.209 --> 13:01.243
Okay, any questions so far?

13:01.244 --> 13:02.844
About anything at all.

13:02.845 --> 13:06.648
Girls, boys, life, money,
inkjet printer repair.

13:06.649 --> 13:08.316
Um, can I be
a good baseball player...

13:08.317 --> 13:09.685
(wheezing): ...with asthma?

13:09.686 --> 13:11.253
Rudy, I'm gonna tell you a story.

13:11.254 --> 13:12.688
A famous baseball player...

13:12.689 --> 13:13.822
whose name I can't
remember right now...

13:13.823 --> 13:15.824
had Lou Gehrig's Disease

13:15.825 --> 13:18.360
and he didn't let it slow him down.
That was inspiring.

13:18.361 --> 13:21.396
Um, can Ollie and I be umpires?
Yes, you can.

13:21.397 --> 13:23.865
You're out of there!
You're out of there!

13:23.866 --> 13:26.368
You're out of there!
You're out of there!

13:26.402 --> 13:29.538
The Deuce, will I ever get over
being scared of the ball?

13:29.539 --> 13:31.740
Gene, listen to me.
You are so much

13:31.741 --> 13:33.241
bigger and rounder than that ball,

13:33.242 --> 13:34.876
it should be scared of <i>you.</i>

13:34.911 --> 13:36.411
(high voice): Oh, no, it's Gene.

13:36.412 --> 13:38.213
I won't hurt you, baseball.

13:38.214 --> 13:40.215
That's okay.
It's your job to hit me

13:40.216 --> 13:43.719
over the fence.
I love you so much, Gene. Aw.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.353
(phone rings) Hold on,
getting a call.

13:45.354 --> 13:47.923
Ugh, Mr. You Owe Me
$1,100 Manoogian.

13:47.924 --> 13:51.093
That is a long first name
and a long last name.

13:51.127 --> 13:52.461
Hey, Mr. Manoogian.

13:52.462 --> 13:54.763
Well, I've been
trying to reach you, too.

13:54.764 --> 13:56.198
Uh-huh, I see.

13:56.199 --> 13:57.432
Yes, sir. Okay.

13:57.433 --> 14:00.068
Well, I could pay the bill now,
so you can go ahead

14:00.069 --> 14:01.970
and not put my stuff
out on the street.

14:01.971 --> 14:03.538
I'm sorry, it's how much?

14:03.539 --> 14:05.273
Minibar?
That's where they get you.

14:05.274 --> 14:07.876
All right, well, you know what?
Then I'm coming down there.

14:07.877 --> 14:09.411
And I'm bringing some of my people.

14:09.412 --> 14:10.879
Okay, guys, listen up.

14:10.880 --> 14:14.282
Um, sometimes in baseball
you go on a road trip.

14:14.283 --> 14:17.419
So let's practice piling
into the team bus over there.

14:17.453 --> 14:19.321
Now, everybody grab a bat.

14:19.322 --> 14:20.655
BOB: <i>Linda,</i>

14:20.656 --> 14:23.725
look at me. How did you pay
for baseball camp?

14:23.726 --> 14:27.262
Uh... I, uh,
I sold my porcelain babies.

14:27.263 --> 14:29.431
Wait, I saw those when I
was tearing the place apart.

14:29.432 --> 14:30.766
So you didn't sell them!

14:30.767 --> 14:32.334
Those are my backup babies.

14:32.335 --> 14:34.836
Yeah, that's the B-team.
Look how ugly they are.

14:34.837 --> 14:37.589
You can do this the easy way or
the hard way. (porcelain shatters)

14:37.590 --> 14:39.908
Tina!
Do you think I'm playing here?

14:39.909 --> 14:44.179
(exclaims) I need that espresso
machine back... oh, my head.

14:46.015 --> 14:48.583
(giggling)

14:52.021 --> 14:53.238
Hi, Tina,

14:53.239 --> 14:54.940
I think you're more into espresso

14:54.941 --> 14:56.925
than you are into me.

14:56.926 --> 14:59.528
(screams) It's true.
I love espresso, coffee,

14:59.529 --> 15:01.363
caffeinated teas,
and then Jimmy Jr.

15:01.364 --> 15:02.447
In that order.

15:02.448 --> 15:03.582
All right, I did it.

15:03.583 --> 15:05.317
I sold the espresso machine.

15:05.318 --> 15:07.018
(sighs) That machine
was the crown jewel

15:07.019 --> 15:08.520
of this restaurant, Linda.

15:08.521 --> 15:10.539
It was made in Turin, Italy.

15:10.540 --> 15:12.374
That's where they make... Fiats!

15:12.375 --> 15:13.875
Big whoop. It was a waste of money.

15:13.876 --> 15:15.944
I'd rather waste money on Gene.

15:15.945 --> 15:19.281
You don't even know if this Deuce
is legit. He has a Web site.

15:19.282 --> 15:21.116
Yeah, they don't just
give those out.

15:21.117 --> 15:23.285
We're going down there and we're
coming back with our money.

15:23.286 --> 15:24.953
Or a really good baseball player.

15:24.954 --> 15:27.372
I hope neither of you
are getting your hopes up.

15:27.373 --> 15:29.140
Tina, break another one.
That one.

15:29.141 --> 15:30.826
Oh, no.

15:32.515 --> 15:33.565
THE DEUCE: Okay, we're here.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.100
Everybody out.
Hey, this is where

15:35.101 --> 15:36.901
our dad goes for his naps.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.803
Hi, Mr. Manoogian!

15:38.804 --> 15:40.071
- Oh, crap.
- Hey,

15:40.106 --> 15:41.923
hey, hey, hey!
No, no, no, too late!

15:41.924 --> 15:43.525
Listen. Come on!
You're too late!

15:43.526 --> 15:44.926
Come on, man.
Not cool!

15:44.927 --> 15:46.320
You're not cool!
Now, listen.

15:46.328 --> 15:48.563
I don't have the whole
$1,100 in cash.

15:48.597 --> 15:50.598
(groans): Oh...
But I can sign over some checks.

15:50.599 --> 15:52.333
Now, this one has a flag on it,

15:52.334 --> 15:54.035
and patriotic checks never bounce.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.704
No, no, no, I don't need your
stupid flag checks, okay?!

15:56.705 --> 15:59.174
Pay me now,
or I'm keeping your DVD player.

15:59.175 --> 16:00.475
It's not a DVD player,

16:00.476 --> 16:03.378
it's a Blu-ray player
that also plays DVDs!

16:03.379 --> 16:05.880
Well, then, that makes it
a DVD player! No, it doesn't!

16:05.881 --> 16:07.615
Hey, how much for this hot pot?

16:07.616 --> 16:09.184
This is not a yard sale.

16:09.185 --> 16:11.553
Three dollars.
Okay, it is a yard sale.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.054
LINDA: Well, they were here.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.522
BOB: Oh, that's great, so

16:14.523 --> 16:16.357
this guy... The Deuce...
just takes off somewhere

16:16.358 --> 16:18.793
with all the kids?
Look, he left that gym bag.

16:18.828 --> 16:21.996
See, we've got bath towels
from the Sand Flea motel

16:21.997 --> 16:24.232
and some crumbled
deodorant in a baggy.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.400
See, that's valuable.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.068
He's got to come back for that.

16:27.069 --> 16:30.038
Oh, my God, Lin, I don't want
to sit around waiting for him.

16:30.039 --> 16:33.074
Let's go to the Sand Flea. Yeah,
we shouldn't even stop for coffee.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.442
But let's stop for coffee.

16:34.477 --> 16:35.477
MANOOGIAN: Okay, this isn't enough.

16:35.478 --> 16:36.778
You're still way short.

16:36.812 --> 16:38.580
Sorry I couldn't move
the tube socks.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.932
Okay, fine! If that's
how you want to play it,

16:40.933 --> 16:42.600
we're just gonna
take some swings...

16:42.601 --> 16:44.402
at your soda machine.

16:44.403 --> 16:45.737
Go to it, guys.

16:45.771 --> 16:47.238
But isn't that vandalism?

16:47.273 --> 16:49.874
Babe Ruth used to beat the crap
out of a root beer machine.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.442
Now look at him.
Okay.

16:51.443 --> 16:52.727
(grunting)

16:52.778 --> 16:54.162
Yeah, there you go.

16:54.196 --> 16:55.847
Four-bagger.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.448
Grand salami.

16:57.449 --> 16:59.501
That's a good looking
foul ball right there.

16:59.535 --> 17:02.353
Soda, you made me fat,
but you also made me strong!

17:02.388 --> 17:03.621
Maid cart, get it.

17:03.622 --> 17:05.522
I'll come back later.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.525
These boys are very
weak. I see no damage.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.511
They're damaging your pride.

17:09.512 --> 17:10.862
Not very much.

17:10.880 --> 17:11.913
BOB: Oh, my God,

17:11.964 --> 17:12.964
there's Gene.

17:12.964 --> 17:14.199
Gene, what are you doing?

17:14.233 --> 17:17.367
Playing baseball, and I'm great.
(grunts)

17:17.403 --> 17:19.537
Look at his swing, Bobby.
Poetry in motion.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.915
Yeah, slow motion.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.074
Some soda's leaking out.
It might have caffeine in it.

17:23.075 --> 17:24.292
BOB: Tina, don't lick that.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.310
Do you folks mind?

17:25.310 --> 17:27.253
These practices
are closed to parents.

17:27.279 --> 17:29.214
Just give us our
money back and we'll go.

17:29.248 --> 17:31.467
Refund, no.
That's not gonna happen.

17:31.483 --> 17:32.550
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.886
Guys, I did everything
The Deuce told me to

17:34.887 --> 17:36.806
and now I'm excellent at baseball.

17:36.822 --> 17:39.157
Gene, this is a scam.
Excuse me,

17:39.158 --> 17:41.359
The Deuce has ears <i>and</i> feelings.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.328
Well, I'm sorry.
Well, I forgive you.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.830
But now we want our money.
Whoa, bro, easy.

17:45.831 --> 17:48.433
The next game Gene plays,
you'll notice a real diff.

17:48.434 --> 17:52.003
Too bad, by then, I'll be setting
up my winter camp in Arizona.

17:52.004 --> 17:54.005
Deucing in the desert.
Aw,

17:54.006 --> 17:56.158
you're gonna miss Gene
hitting all those home runs.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.376
And you're gonna miss
the leaves changing.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.997
He's not better, Lin.
It's not a real baseball camp.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.247
He is so better.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.915
I wish there was a game right now.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.416
He'd show you, buddy.

18:05.417 --> 18:06.935
You know, what?
A game right now.

18:06.936 --> 18:08.836
Let's do that.
Yeah, let's do that.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.271
Well, let's not rush into anything.

18:10.272 --> 18:11.990
Some of my training
takes a little time...

18:11.991 --> 18:13.175
to sink in.

18:13.192 --> 18:14.459
Oh, don't be modest, The Deuce.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.012
You know what you're doing.

18:16.028 --> 18:19.015
He's gifted; He said so.
He's gonna do a TED Talk.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.431
Okay, look, I got to go.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.317
No, no, no, no,
you're not going anywhere.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.419
We've got enough people
here for a game

18:24.420 --> 18:26.187
in that vacant lot right there.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.188
Now, if Gene gets a hit...

18:27.189 --> 18:28.256
which he won't, because

18:28.257 --> 18:29.991
you're a fraud...
you keep the money.

18:29.992 --> 18:32.093
If not, we get a full refund.

18:32.127 --> 18:34.462
- That sounds really complicated.
- I didn't get it either.
