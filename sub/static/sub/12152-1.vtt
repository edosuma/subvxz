Angel massacred his family. He spent
the rest of his life seeking revenge.

- Me?

01:12.693 --> 01:15.412

You want to bitch-slap sourpuss
over there for practice?

I'm your cheering section.

29:30.533 --> 29:31.761
I have to do it.

Shh. You need to rest now.

Pig's blood isn't enough.

- He needs more substantial nourishment.
- Like what?

I'm not feeding that thing.

ground to cover, so let's get to it.

30:40.093 --> 30:42.004
But first, let's talk about Lilah.

30:42.453 --> 30:44.762
Everybody had a chance
to review her file?

30:45.893 --> 30:48.168
Good. Recommendations?

30:48.373 --> 30:50.841
If I could just have a few minutes
to explain.

30:51.053 --> 30:52.645
Your record speaks for itself.

30:52.853 --> 30:55.492
Volumes.
Your failures at Wolfram and Hart...

30:55.653 --> 30:59.168
...outstrip your successes
by an uncomfortable margin.

30:59.373 --> 31:02.251
Perhaps you would fare better
at a less central office.

31:02.413 --> 31:04.165
One of the third-world
dimensions maybe.

31:04.693 --> 31:07.082
- Sorry.
- What was that?

31:07.613 --> 31:09.569
I said, I'm sorry.

31:09.773 --> 31:15.405
I've made mistakes.
But fear was never one of them.

31:16.893 --> 31:18.690
Is there something you'd like to share?

31:18.893 --> 31:22.090
Why haven't we contained
the vampire offspring for study?

31:22.773 --> 31:24.570
We're assessing that situation.

31:24.773 --> 31:26.729
The same way you're assessing Angel.

Why aren't we trying
to pinpoint Angel's location?

31:29.293 --> 31:31.853
Lilah, this is my corner of the sky.

31:32.053 --> 31:35.011
I decide when the sun rises
and when it sets.

31:35.213 --> 31:38.808
Lack of long-term vision has always
been one of your shortcomings.

31:39.013 --> 31:42.005
And lack of courage has always
been one of yours.

31:42.213 --> 31:45.523
You're afraid of Angel and his son.
And that's the reason...

31:45.693 --> 31:49.572
...for your daring strategy
of "wait and see," isn't it?

31:50.253 --> 31:53.404
You're afraid.
And fear breeds weakness.

31:53.893 --> 31:57.203
I'm hurt. Is that really
what you think of me?

31:57.413 --> 32:00.291
Yes. And Mr. Suvarta agrees with me.

32:01.973 --> 32:03.645
You spoke to a senior partner?

32:03.853 --> 32:07.892
He was really very helpful.
Had some great hints on office furniture.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.128
This is outrageous.

No tomatoes.

been through, Connor.

Being taken away by Holtz,
raised in that place.
