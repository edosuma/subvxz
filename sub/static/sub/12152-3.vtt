I sort of need to talk to you in person.

What you seek can only be found
inside the Axis of Pythia.

- Cordelia.

There was all this light around her...

to be made up of pure joy.

Angel does. I'm really
worried about him, Charles.

19:39.973 --> 19:42.692
Okay, I know he was right
to send Connor away...

19:42.853 --> 19:46.448

must be unbearable for him.

than that over the years.
