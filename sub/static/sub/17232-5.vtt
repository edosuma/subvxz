WEBVTT

00:02.142 --> 00:03.750
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:05.157 --> 00:08.497
And I'd love it if you could
support me like I support you.

00:08.563 --> 00:09.428
I'm tryin'.

00:09.506 --> 00:11.075
Why does she have to go to work?

00:11.076 --> 00:12.575
Somebody's gotta work around here.

00:12.707 --> 00:14.614
You and Deacon should go
out on the road together.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.225
Remember those love songs
you guys used to write?

00:16.226 --> 00:17.661
That's 'cause we were in love.

00:17.716 --> 00:20.110
We done here? Yeah, we're done.

00:20.162 --> 00:21.779
Let's talk about your real estate business.

00:21.780 --> 00:24.030
The more we know, the
more we can protect you.

00:24.032 --> 00:26.027
We have kept this secret a long time.

00:26.122 --> 00:27.018
I got nowhere to go.

00:27.019 --> 00:28.807
My mother is a drug addict.

00:28.816 --> 00:31.116
She's gonna cause a lot
more trouble out there

00:31.117 --> 00:32.348
than she could in here.

She still at it?

01:37.069 --> 01:38.814
Well, at least she's
keeping out of trouble.

01:38.815 --> 01:40.412
In fact, we should put out press

01:40.413 --> 01:42.760
about her being back in
the studio, hard at work.

01:42.813 --> 01:44.070
That is a great ID...

01:45.099 --> 01:47.548
hey, you guys calling it? Oh, no,

01:47.549 --> 01:49.627
she's just finally giving
'em a bathroom break.

01:49.628 --> 01:51.291
Which one's hers? This one.

01:51.292 --> 01:53.365
You know, there's no reason why
this has to be finished tonight.

01:53.525 --> 01:55.634
Yeah.
Or... this morning.

01:56.021 --> 01:56.948
Tell me about it.

01:57.350 --> 01:58.947
Problem is, she doesn't wanna go home.

01:58.997 --> 02:00.455
Problem is her mom.

02:00.456 --> 02:01.825
How long is her mother gonna be there?

02:01.876 --> 02:03.371
I don't know.
Lawyer says she has to stick around

02:03.372 --> 02:05.702
till after her sentencing hearing.
Or go to rehab.

02:05.916 --> 02:08.020
According to mom, that's a nonstarter.

02:08.039 --> 02:09.473
Yeah, well, it usually is.

02:11.127 --> 02:13.377
We have not gotten a good enough chorus.

02:13.413 --> 02:14.162
I've got to be honest.

02:14.163 --> 02:16.496
I don't know how much longer
these guys have got it in 'em.

02:16.497 --> 02:18.014
Okay, well, I'm paying them.

02:18.785 --> 02:21.662
Look, we have reached the point
of diminishing returns here.

02:21.715 --> 02:24.590
We've got 20 takes that are perfect.

02:24.772 --> 02:27.949
Randy, trust me. I will tell you
when we have a perfect take.

02:29.169 --> 02:30.094
Okay.

02:35.089 --> 02:36.732
Hey.
Listen to me.

02:39.412 --> 02:41.378
I know you don't wanna
talk about your mother.

02:41.616 --> 02:42.705
But you're gonna anyway.

02:42.706 --> 02:44.864
Yeah, I am.
As you might have heard,

02:44.865 --> 02:46.845
I have a little history with addiction.

02:49.139 --> 02:51.552
Look, I'm sure you've tried to
get her in a bunch of programs.

02:51.685 --> 02:52.801
Yeah.
Yeah.

02:52.802 --> 02:54.849
Well, you don't have to
do that part by yourself.

02:56.341 --> 02:57.777
I can help you.
No.

02:57.991 --> 02:59.938
I don't... no, I don't need help.

03:00.516 --> 03:02.279
Look, I'm just... I'm counting the days

03:02.280 --> 03:04.212
she can stay in her half of the house.

03:04.311 --> 03:05.586
I can stay on mine.

03:05.861 --> 03:07.570
Then she'll be gone, and that'll be it.

03:07.765 --> 03:09.087
That's your big plan?

03:10.786 --> 03:12.273
Can you let them know we're done?

03:13.364 --> 03:14.141
Yep.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.521
Where you goin'?

03:16.472 --> 03:17.443
I don't know.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.301
Oh, I do love this dress.

03:28.302 --> 03:30.800
Uh-huh.
Maybe you could wear it on the cover

03:30.801 --> 03:32.410
of your new greatest hits album.

03:34.544 --> 03:35.579
Hey.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.359
I already crossed over to the
dark side to do this commercial.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.350
Don't push your luck.
I told you.

03:40.351 --> 03:42.889
I will do a greatest
hits album when I'm 70.

03:43.022 --> 03:45.438
Okay, but this is Marshall
Evans reaching out.

03:45.439 --> 03:46.842
This is a peace offering.

03:46.848 --> 03:48.258
I appreciate that,

03:48.259 --> 03:50.030
but I want my next album to be...

03:51.220 --> 03:54.365
New and original and great.

03:56.735 --> 03:57.839
Hold on one second.
Sorry.

03:58.561 --> 03:59.374
Hey, babe.

03:59.588 --> 04:00.637
Hey, how's it going?

04:01.093 --> 04:02.400
It's goin'.
How you doing?

04:02.401 --> 04:04.723
You're the one who's about to go
do a couple rounds with Coleman.

04:04.724 --> 04:06.766
Well, I'm not too worried about the debate.

04:06.792 --> 04:07.906
I can handle Coleman.

04:08.471 --> 04:10.452
Now my poll numbers, on the other hand...

04:10.784 --> 04:11.831
You want me to be there?

04:11.965 --> 04:15.369
No. No.
We need you to work. It'll be fine.

04:15.839 --> 04:18.216
All right. Well, you go give 'em hell.

04:18.430 --> 04:20.225
You, too.
Love you.

04:20.226 --> 04:21.084
Love you, too.

04:23.441 --> 04:24.668
Well, I gotta take off.

04:24.750 --> 04:26.120
I got a meeting over at the label.

04:26.907 --> 04:29.212
All right, well, you give
ol' Marshall Evans my best,

04:29.213 --> 04:31.836
and, uh, I need a new collaborator.

04:32.204 --> 04:33.773
And I also need a new guitar player

04:33.774 --> 04:35.115
in case you haven't noticed.

04:36.453 --> 04:37.639
Why, did someone suspect us?

04:37.640 --> 04:39.763
They will.
I had to see you.

04:41.027 --> 04:42.254
I can't go to prison.

04:42.255 --> 04:43.819
Hey, Peggy, please.
Calm down.

04:43.820 --> 04:45.369
Wait.
No one is going to prison.

04:45.373 --> 04:47.912
The auditors wanna question me this week.

04:48.332 --> 04:50.466
They will be able to go
over all my accounts.

04:50.467 --> 04:52.387
Okay, okay.
Look. Let's not overreact.

04:52.388 --> 04:54.227
Teddy, we borrowed over $2 million...

04:54.228 --> 04:56.002
yeah, and returned every penny of it.

04:56.003 --> 04:57.792
Doesn't matter.
It's still embezzlement.

04:58.804 --> 05:01.794
If we both go to the feds now,
before they find anything,

05:01.795 --> 05:04.322
then there's a good chance
that they will cut us a deal...

05:04.323 --> 05:05.631
okay, Peggy, listen to me.

05:06.068 --> 05:08.930
If you go to the feds now,
it'll ruin everything. Trust me.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.872
I want to. It's just...

05:11.873 --> 05:13.501
Okay, look. I need some time.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.517
Just a day. Give me a day, all right?

05:16.999 --> 05:18.419
I'm really, really scared.

05:18.521 --> 05:21.604
I know, but I'm gonna find a
way to protect both of us.

05:22.295 --> 05:23.477
We are gonna be fine.

05:24.357 --> 05:25.187

Fantastic, Rayna.

06:17.843 --> 06:19.998
Um, we have a problem.

06:20.139 --> 06:21.737
What? They didn't like it, did they?

06:21.738 --> 06:23.625
No, no, they loved it.
All right, it's Deacon.

06:23.824 --> 06:26.378
His lawyer just called. He's
pushing back on the lyrics.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.211
What?

06:28.212 --> 06:29.714
Well, your co-writer is not too happy

06:29.715 --> 06:31.825
with the tweak to the first verse.

06:31.848 --> 06:33.525
Well, I wasn't too happy with it either,

06:33.526 --> 06:35.863
which is why I didn't wanna
do this stupid commercial.

06:36.088 --> 06:37.432
But we agreed to it.

06:37.433 --> 06:38.628
Well, apparently the exact changes

06:38.629 --> 06:41.504
weren't in the contract
that his lawyer approved.

06:42.824 --> 06:43.985
Oh, for heaven sakes.

06:44.643 --> 06:45.893
Yeah.
Well, I'll work on it,

06:45.894 --> 06:48.466
but in the meantime, why
don't you just call him?

06:51.960 --> 06:53.395
That's exactly what he wants.

06:58.148 --> 07:00.388
I got it.
You have rules.

07:00.903 --> 07:03.989
I just don't want this to get complicated.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.162
I've worked with a lot of writing teams,

07:06.163 --> 07:09.904
and I... I don't wanna get
in the middle of something.

07:11.738 --> 07:12.970
You worried about Scarlett?

07:14.333 --> 07:15.478
You're not gonna get in
the middle of something

07:15.479 --> 07:18.117
'cause there's no something
getting in the middle of.

07:18.632 --> 07:20.359
She has a boyfriend, and I have a...

07:21.511 --> 07:22.503
A you.

07:24.970 --> 07:27.687
People always end up getting hurt.
Trust me.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.742
Let's just... let's just
keep this not complicated.

07:31.911 --> 07:33.830
Not complicated.
Okay.

07:34.202 --> 07:35.318
If that's the way you want it.

07:38.411 --> 07:39.797
Hey.
Hey.

07:40.376 --> 07:41.832
Jeanne's hosting a guitar pull

07:41.833 --> 07:43.097
for Lady Antebellum's producer,

07:43.098 --> 07:44.582
and we get to sing.

07:44.587 --> 07:45.487
What? Yeah.

07:46.175 --> 07:47.615
Lady a is looking for some new songs

07:47.616 --> 07:48.448
for their next album,

07:48.449 --> 07:50.529
and I've known their producer,
Paul Worley, forever.

07:50.530 --> 07:52.622
And he's gonna come by
tomorrow, hear some new stuff.

07:52.743 --> 07:54.674
And I want you guys to play.

07:55.112 --> 07:56.501
So we perform here?

07:56.502 --> 07:59.229
Yeah. It's like an incredibly
exclusive writers night

07:59.230 --> 08:00.736
that can lead to getting your song cut.

08:00.737 --> 08:02.059
I'd like to add another guitarist, though,

08:02.060 --> 08:03.656
just to round out your sound a little bit.

08:13.370 --> 08:14.662
It's too quiet in here.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.292
Mama?

08:20.833 --> 08:21.742
Mama?

08:23.984 --> 08:25.881
She's always in here watching TV.

08:26.071 --> 08:27.071
Where is she?

08:27.191 --> 08:28.181
Maybe she's sleeping.

08:33.738 --> 08:34.708
Mama?

08:42.253 --> 08:43.174
Damn it.

08:58.677 --> 08:59.712
Get out of my house!
Hey!

08:59.713 --> 09:01.408
Get out! Those are mine.
Go! That's not fair.

09:01.409 --> 09:04.043
I can help a friend, you know?
You can't even help yourself.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.876
Why are you so mean to me?
There's the front gate.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.341
Why are you so mean to me?
Get your stuff and go.

09:07.342 --> 09:08.953
Mama, get back in the house!

09:09.034 --> 09:10.820
I don't know why you're so mean to me.

09:11.578 --> 09:13.928
You cannot keep doing
this over and over again.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.164
You have got to get some help.

09:15.165 --> 09:16.446
I don't have to do a damn thing.

09:16.447 --> 09:17.851
There's nothing wrong with me.

09:18.285 --> 09:19.371
You're embarrassing.

09:19.372 --> 09:20.665
Oh, I'm embarrassing?

09:20.734 --> 09:22.013
I'm not the one that stole
the frickin' bottle

09:22.014 --> 09:23.708
of nail polish, you little princess,

09:23.886 --> 09:25.672
and you call me "pathetic"?

09:26.157 --> 09:27.786
Yeah. Heard you loud and clear.

09:36.663 --> 09:37.570
White trash.

09:42.394 --> 09:44.034
So if you want more of the same,

09:44.377 --> 09:45.591
then vote for my opponent,

09:45.592 --> 09:47.765
'cause he has more than a
decade on the council.

09:48.454 --> 09:50.769
But if you're excited for a new Nashville,

09:50.888 --> 09:52.703
a place where homegrown businesses

09:52.704 --> 09:55.247
and world-class developments
can thrive again,

09:55.411 --> 09:56.719
then I'm asking for your vote.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.423
My opponent says he's for a new Nashville.

09:59.826 --> 10:01.866
But Teddy Conrad comes from a long line

10:01.867 --> 10:04.523
of old-school country club politicians

10:04.524 --> 10:06.216
going back to his great grandfather...

10:06.266 --> 10:07.638
the late honorable senator.

10:07.708 --> 10:11.286
Unfortunately, he most closely
resembles his father...

10:11.787 --> 10:15.517
a man who failed repeatedly
in spite of his advantages.

10:15.518 --> 10:17.659
I see no need to bring up
my father during a debate.

10:17.660 --> 10:20.360
Teddy Conrad was born with a
silver spoon in his mouth...

10:20.636 --> 10:22.557
a spoon that he's used to dig himself

10:22.558 --> 10:25.126
into a financial hole he
may never climb out of,

10:25.150 --> 10:27.254
and he may use that same silver spoon

10:27.500 --> 10:29.740
to break ground on a baseball stadium

10:29.741 --> 10:32.491
that will drain our city
of millions of dollars.

10:32.492 --> 10:34.649
The only thing Teddy Conrad has ever done

10:34.957 --> 10:37.498
is inherit money and lose it.

10:37.613 --> 10:39.926
Nashville deserves better than that.

10:46.065 --> 10:47.114
She asleep?

10:48.015 --> 10:48.795
Yeah.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.946
I'm so sorry about that, Bo.

10:53.007 --> 10:54.078
That was awful.

10:54.402 --> 10:55.773
Family's complicated.

10:56.210 --> 10:57.641
I don't know what to do anymore.

10:59.168 --> 11:01.980
The more I try to ignore her,
the more noise she makes.

11:02.893 --> 11:04.589
I've tried to get her
clean a hundred times.

11:04.590 --> 11:05.788
That don't work either.

11:05.873 --> 11:07.343
Maybe that's part of the problem.

11:07.875 --> 11:08.829
What's that?

11:09.106 --> 11:10.892
Maybe she can't hear from you anymore.

11:26.142 --> 11:30.569
Hello? Hey, it's me. You still wanna help?

11:35.796 --> 11:37.797
But Jeanne said the best version of myself,

11:37.798 --> 11:39.893
so I thought maybe I'd wear my red boots,

11:39.894 --> 11:41.556
but then I thought maybe that was

11:41.557 --> 11:43.554
the deranged redneck version of myself,

11:43.555 --> 11:44.930
and I don't really wanna do that.

11:44.931 --> 11:48.211
Um... well, they're bringing in

11:48.212 --> 11:50.929
another guitar player for
a bigger sound and all.

11:51.347 --> 11:53.486
Yeah, it's... it's kinda crazy. Uh...

11:54.179 --> 11:56.610
Oh, mama, Avery's here. We're
just about to do dinner.

11:56.611 --> 11:58.638
Can I, uh, can I call you
back a little later?

11:59.156 --> 12:00.413
All right, I love you. Bye-bye.

12:00.414 --> 12:02.437
Hey, baby. How you doin'? All right.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.709
You're really excited about
this thing, aren't ya?

12:07.388 --> 12:10.326
Well, I guess it is...
kind of a big... thing.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.695
You said they're bringing
in another guitar player?

12:15.149 --> 12:15.879
Yeah.

12:16.462 --> 12:19.545
You know... I do happen to play guitar.

12:21.516 --> 12:22.440
What do you mean?

12:22.864 --> 12:24.576
I'm not doing much of
anything else tomorrow.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.329
I can... I can come play if you want me to.

12:27.409 --> 12:28.207
Really?

12:29.936 --> 12:31.278
You wouldn't mind doing that?

12:32.784 --> 12:34.451
'Cause I am nervous as all get-out.

12:34.452 --> 12:37.088
Having you there... would
really mean the world.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.181
So it's a "yes"?

12:38.190 --> 12:40.361
That's a "hell, yes." Thank you.

13:06.857 --> 13:08.120
Hey. Hey.

13:09.051 --> 13:09.907
How you doin'?

13:11.467 --> 13:12.294
I'm all right.

13:13.833 --> 13:14.900
Did you catch anything?

13:15.850 --> 13:16.707
Nope.

13:19.098 --> 13:22.292
So I wanted to talk to you about
this whole commercial thing,

13:22.360 --> 13:27.173
you know... see if you could
help me try and make it happen.

13:27.576 --> 13:29.413
Not the part about changing the words.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.093
Well, the changing the words is
what's gonna make it happen.

13:33.768 --> 13:35.411
Come on, Rayna. It's a gd song.

13:36.040 --> 13:39.299
I know it's a good song, Deacon.
It's still a good song.

13:39.638 --> 13:40.616
Don't do this to me.

13:40.617 --> 13:42.809
You know it's killing me
I'm doing a commercial.

13:42.810 --> 13:44.710
I said no to this stuff my whole career.

13:45.369 --> 13:46.552
I've gotta do it.

13:46.553 --> 13:48.485
I need the money for the
family, the whole thing.

13:48.486 --> 13:50.628
You know it. Yeah, well,
that's fine, and I get that,

13:50.629 --> 13:54.293
but for me, music's all I got.

13:54.294 --> 13:55.560
It's the only part of my life

13:55.561 --> 13:57.528
that I ever seem to be
able to do halfway good,

13:57.529 --> 14:00.517
so... it means something to me.

14:00.518 --> 14:01.728
Well, I know it does.

14:02.662 --> 14:04.051
It means something to me, too.

14:04.774 --> 14:05.909
That's why I'm trying to figure out

14:05.910 --> 14:07.427
how I can afford to keep playing it.

14:09.017 --> 14:10.897
Well, I'm not the one
who canceled the tour.

14:12.279 --> 14:13.890
You know why I canceled the tour.

14:15.925 --> 14:17.510
Doesn't mean we have to sell our songs

14:17.511 --> 14:18.534
to the highest bidder.

14:18.535 --> 14:20.227
Oh, I see. So now you're so principled

14:20.228 --> 14:22.342
that you can't use one of
our songs in a commercial,

14:22.343 --> 14:24.022
but you can go out there and
play with Juliette Barnes.

14:24.023 --> 14:26.537
That doesn't seem to offend
your delicate sensibilities.

14:26.538 --> 14:27.959
I don't want the song in a commercial

14:27.960 --> 14:30.548
for beauty products. Please
just sign the release.

14:30.549 --> 14:31.715
No. Just come on.

14:32.647 --> 14:33.412
No.

14:36.640 --> 14:37.516
Hey.

14:41.633 --> 14:43.246
Is this how you wanna do this?

14:49.395 --> 14:50.573
Nice to see you, Deacon.

14:52.022 --> 14:53.235
Nice to see you, Rayna.

15:06.548 --> 15:08.723
I talked to Vernon black.

15:08.854 --> 15:10.789
He's... he's dying to write with you,

15:10.790 --> 15:12.210
but he's booked for the next three weeks.

15:13.063 --> 15:14.770
Oh, man. Three weeks?

15:15.015 --> 15:17.076
Well... you know, there's
not a writer in town

15:17.077 --> 15:18.514
that doesn't want to work with you.

15:18.515 --> 15:20.307
It's just, the good ones

15:20.308 --> 15:22.498
all, uh, you know, have commitments.

15:26.632 --> 15:28.211
Maybe I should do it myself.

15:28.697 --> 15:29.940
Do what? Write.

15:32.328 --> 15:33.880
You know, I gotta keep moving forward.

15:35.336 --> 15:36.757
I feel like I've been stuck...

15:38.571 --> 15:40.038
Beholdin' to other people.

15:43.565 --> 15:44.856
I can prove it to myself.

15:45.932 --> 15:46.883
Maybe you should.

15:49.904 --> 15:51.949
Now what seems to be the problem?

15:52.176 --> 15:53.925
It wasn't the best debate
performance I ever saw but...

15:53.926 --> 15:55.360
it's more than the debate.

15:57.747 --> 15:59.491
It's that damn busted real estate deal...

15:59.492 --> 16:00.700
the cumberland project.

16:02.897 --> 16:04.237
Coleman hit a nerve, huh?

16:06.017 --> 16:08.589
You lied about it during your
vulnerability study, didn't you?

16:08.768 --> 16:09.532
Yeah.

16:11.364 --> 16:12.720
And it just won't go away.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.246
Teddy...

16:18.450 --> 16:20.370
What's done is done, but
if you want my help,

16:20.371 --> 16:21.951
you're gonna have to tell me everything.

16:21.952 --> 16:23.421
Sit down. All right.

16:30.737 --> 16:31.873
I, uh...

16:34.995 --> 16:36.253
I ran out of capital

16:37.713 --> 16:39.600
while I was waiting for the
permits to come through.

16:40.373 --> 16:42.062
Well, then the market crashed.

16:43.666 --> 16:46.227
Taxes came due, accounts payable piled up,

16:46.228 --> 16:48.125
and I did what I had to do.

16:48.516 --> 16:50.033
You floated your funds.

16:50.882 --> 16:52.048
So we wouldn't fold.

16:53.489 --> 16:55.263
I did it to protect my investors.

16:55.825 --> 16:57.104
Where'd the cash come from?

16:58.113 --> 16:59.886
One of my partners... Peggy Kenter.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.066
Robert's wife.

17:01.264 --> 17:02.233
That's right.

17:02.881 --> 17:04.336
Partner in what sense?

17:04.337 --> 17:05.641
Strictly business.

17:06.465 --> 17:09.246
Peggy found the money, and I
didn't ask any questions.

17:10.190 --> 17:13.626
She was willing to defraud a
credit union with you. Why?

17:14.169 --> 17:16.520
Well, maybe she wanted our relationship

17:16.521 --> 17:17.685
to be more than I did,

17:17.686 --> 17:19.493
but that was on her end, not mine.

17:21.305 --> 17:22.882
You needed help, you shoulda come to me.

17:22.940 --> 17:25.143
Lamar, I thought I had it under control.

17:26.156 --> 17:28.751
Anyhow... Peggy was able to bury it

17:28.752 --> 17:29.576
till we paid the money back,

17:29.577 --> 17:30.497
which we did.

17:33.529 --> 17:35.764
But you see, now there's a federal audit.

17:36.520 --> 17:37.557
And she's scared.

17:43.139 --> 17:45.051
I'll make sure Peggy feels safe.

17:46.993 --> 17:48.765
You just keep your head in the campaign.

17:49.634 --> 17:50.604
Thank you, lamar.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.454
It's been a hell of a week.

17:57.372 --> 17:58.215
Teddy.

18:01.258 --> 18:03.347
You are not gonna be your father.

18:06.571 --> 18:07.446
Hey.

18:08.146 --> 18:10.572
This is Deacon. He plays
with the band sometimes.

18:10.573 --> 18:12.170
Yeah, honey. I know who he is.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.266
This is my mama jolene.

18:14.782 --> 18:16.667
Why as I live and breathe. Pleasure, ma'am.

18:17.391 --> 18:18.684
Juliette, you should've told us

18:18.685 --> 18:19.747
we were having company coming over.

18:19.748 --> 18:20.994
I must look a mess.

18:21.783 --> 18:23.844
Y'all got some rehearsing
to do or something?

18:24.107 --> 18:25.242
Not exactly.

18:26.352 --> 18:27.341
Juliette's been...

18:28.016 --> 18:29.039
A little worried about you, ma'am.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.238
Says you've been having some troubles.

18:31.239 --> 18:32.276
What on earth?

18:32.887 --> 18:34.628
No. Um, I'm fine.

18:35.655 --> 18:36.580
Mama.

18:38.328 --> 18:39.316
Please.

18:40.566 --> 18:41.635
What's going on here?

18:43.638 --> 18:45.284
I was just hoping we
could talk a little bit.

20:38.188 --> 20:39.207
Thanks.

20:41.930 --> 20:43.350
I can get back on track, you know?

20:43.737 --> 20:44.984
Yeah, I know.

20:45.930 --> 20:47.015
Just need a little help.

20:48.332 --> 20:50.103
Everyone needs a little
help now and then, right?

20:50.970 --> 20:52.410
If you could do this on your own,

20:52.411 --> 20:54.181
don't you think you probably
would've done it by now?

20:54.733 --> 20:55.626
Yeah. Le

20:56.543 --> 20:59.197
look at me. I am making
a total fool of myself.

20:59.198 --> 21:00.250
You know, I remember

21:01.505 --> 21:02.926
I used to go down to the whistle stop

21:02.927 --> 21:04.831
and I would watch you play in Murfreesboro.

21:04.832 --> 21:05.961
You did not?

21:06.240 --> 21:08.555
Murfreesboro? That is a long time ago.

21:08.574 --> 21:10.150
It was before she was born.

21:10.729 --> 21:12.039
Before she was using.

21:12.842 --> 21:15.204
Juliette, do you think you'd
do me a favor and, uh,

21:15.381 --> 21:18.067
get me a little bit more water
from the kitchen, please?

21:20.616 --> 21:21.507
Thank you.

21:25.225 --> 21:27.057
Jolene, I don't even know
what I got to say, all right?

21:27.058 --> 21:29.488
I can't promise you what's
gonna happen if you get clean.

21:29.922 --> 21:30.854
But unfortunately,

21:30.855 --> 21:33.478
I know exactly what's gonna
happen if you don't.

21:33.479 --> 21:34.676
I don't mean to be like this.

21:34.677 --> 21:36.114
I know that. I know it.

21:38.869 --> 21:40.722
I know a really good place, jolene.

21:41.188 --> 21:42.595
Those places don't work for me.

21:42.596 --> 21:44.608
That's exactly what I
said till one of 'em did.

21:45.374 --> 21:46.763
No, jolene, listen to me.

21:46.944 --> 21:50.382
Honey, you have a daughter, and
I know to you it looks like

21:50.383 --> 21:51.829
she's up on top of the
world, but I tell you what...

21:51.830 --> 21:53.783
that girl is hurting, and she needs you.

21:53.784 --> 21:55.558
She might not know it,
you might not know it,

21:55.559 --> 21:58.789
but she needs you and she needs
you bad and she needs you clean.

21:59.189 --> 22:00.162
You understand that?

22:06.554 --> 22:07.448
Okay?

22:10.555 --> 22:11.671
Okay.

22:14.368 --> 22:16.140
All right. Okay now, that's good.

22:23.317 --> 22:24.305
You're welcome.

22:25.698 --> 22:26.608
What?

22:27.242 --> 22:29.847
Oh, clearly, you meant to
walk in and say thank you

22:29.848 --> 22:31.447
since I did you a favor today.

22:31.754 --> 22:32.951
Probably just didn't hear you.

22:33.179 --> 22:34.438
What the hell is wrong with you?

22:34.924 --> 22:36.134
What was that down there, huh?

22:36.393 --> 22:37.273
Excuse me?

22:37.274 --> 22:39.384
All you had to do was play
what was on the chart,

22:39.385 --> 22:40.889
not try and steal the spotlight.

22:41.691 --> 22:43.816
Hey, man, no one told me not to be myself

22:43.817 --> 22:46.217
while you and Scarlett were
making eyes at each other.

22:46.218 --> 22:49.005
It's acting, you idiot. We're
trying to sell a love song.

22:49.006 --> 22:50.731
Yeah, well, it's pretty damn good acting.

22:55.910 --> 22:57.262
You know what? I don't need this.

22:59.038 --> 23:00.185
Come on. Let's get out of here.

23:00.359 --> 23:01.366
With pleasure.

23:32.588 --> 23:34.085
You know, I was just thinking that, um...

23:35.501 --> 23:37.449
Thinking's not your
friend right now, jolene.

23:47.833 --> 23:50.294
Man, those are just for my back. Come on.

23:50.295 --> 23:51.731
You can't take these with you.

23:57.959 --> 23:59.169
I don't think I can do this.

23:59.178 --> 24:01.558
You can do it. You can. I know you can.

24:06.090 --> 24:07.544
I can't do this. Man, I can't do this.

24:07.545 --> 24:09.575
Juliette, you can't make me do this.

24:10.695 --> 24:11.847
Look what you're doing to me!

24:11.848 --> 24:13.896
You cannot force me to do this!

24:51.536 --> 24:53.644
Well, she's in there now.
That's all you can do.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.259
You okay? Yeah.

24:59.753 --> 25:01.090
Was she always like that?

25:01.465 --> 25:03.763
You know, abusive?

25:05.208 --> 25:06.483
Once in a while.

25:13.630 --> 25:14.599
Hey.

25:17.023 --> 25:19.065
I just wanted to say thank you.

25:20.142 --> 25:21.896
Well, you don't have to do that.

25:23.198 --> 25:26.153
Between friends, sometimes
you can just say, "thanks."

25:29.055 --> 25:31.289
I've never thought about anybody like that.

25:32.527 --> 25:33.929
What, as a friend?

25:34.975 --> 25:38.057
Everybody I know just wants
something from me, so...

25:40.558 --> 25:42.473
That's a sad way to live.

25:43.007 --> 25:45.595
Yeah, well, it may be sad, but it's true.

25:47.918 --> 25:50.633
You know, not everybody wants
something from you, Juliette.

25:52.222 --> 25:53.959
And if you think they do, well,

25:55.119 --> 25:57.948
maybe you need to spend some
more time by yourself, you know?

25:58.510 --> 26:00.682
All these issues you got
with your mom and work

26:00.683 --> 26:02.468
and that video... just...

26:04.137 --> 26:06.019
Just put 'em in your rearview mirror.

26:07.850 --> 26:10.466
You sound like a shrink I went to once.

26:11.674 --> 26:12.836
Once.

26:18.488 --> 26:20.324
Thanks for your help today.

26:24.151 --> 26:26.543
So I guess I'll see you when I see ya.

26:30.246 --> 26:32.143
You let me know if you
need anything, all right?

26:33.398 --> 26:34.592
I'll be fine.

26:40.975 --> 26:41.752
Hey.

26:41.753 --> 26:42.567
Hey.

26:42.568 --> 26:43.714
Paychecks?

26:44.009 --> 26:45.027
Yep.

26:45.369 --> 26:46.420
Me, too.

26:46.985 --> 26:48.067
Thank you.

26:51.178 --> 26:53.491
I heard you two fightin' last night.

26:54.891 --> 26:57.939
So I thought maybe I
should clear something up.

26:59.528 --> 27:01.492
There's nothing going on between you and I.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.411
Well...

27:04.105 --> 27:05.140
You and I are friends,

27:05.141 --> 27:07.838
and we're songwriting
partners, but that's it.

27:08.805 --> 27:09.680
Of course that's it.

27:09.681 --> 27:11.131
I'm with Avery.

27:11.457 --> 27:12.523
I know.

27:12.737 --> 27:14.011
I'm with Hailey.

27:15.124 --> 27:16.059
Really?

27:16.929 --> 27:18.760
Likewith her, with her?

27:18.761 --> 27:21.171
Like, it's a... thing?

27:22.457 --> 27:23.689
Yeah, it's a thing.

27:23.690 --> 27:25.731
Oh. Sorry. I just,

27:26.060 --> 27:27.891
you know, I wanted to be clear, is all.

27:31.442 --> 27:33.107
It's from Hailey.

27:34.569 --> 27:36.099
Jeanne's heard back from Paul.

27:45.774 --> 27:46.759
Hey.

27:47.694 --> 27:48.665
Hey.

27:49.870 --> 27:51.000
You're up late.

27:52.350 --> 27:53.799
Yeah. What time is it?

27:54.125 --> 27:55.527
30 in the morning.

27:57.420 --> 27:58.631
You're up late, too.

27:59.198 --> 28:00.903
Just trying to turn things around.

28:01.933 --> 28:03.815
That debate didn't help much, so...

28:06.749 --> 28:08.279
Sorry you had a tough time.

28:10.910 --> 28:12.232
You want to talk about it?

28:12.877 --> 28:13.976
Not really.

28:15.853 --> 28:17.448
Doesn't really matter anyway.

28:20.505 --> 28:21.631
What you working on?

28:23.012 --> 28:24.430
I'm, uh...

28:25.222 --> 28:26.638
Writing a song,

28:27.206 --> 28:29.407
by myself, for a change.

28:34.901 --> 28:36.207
I'll leave you to it.

28:47.030 --> 28:49.183
What exactly happened between you two?

28:50.310 --> 28:52.911
And why'd you... why'd you cancel the tour?

28:55.572 --> 28:56.783
Did you sleep with him?

28:58.837 --> 28:59.983
No.

29:02.821 --> 29:04.639
Do you really think I would do that?

29:11.205 --> 29:12.384
Did you want to?

29:17.845 --> 29:21.150
Teddy, we have got to just
put the past behind us.

29:21.863 --> 29:23.425
Believe me, I'm trying.

29:31.767 --> 29:33.921
Going back to that place was, uh...

29:36.717 --> 29:38.951
A hell of a lot harder than
I thought it was gonna be.

29:39.691 --> 29:42.260
Walking through that door, smelling that...

29:43.434 --> 29:45.205
Rehab sweat,

29:46.234 --> 29:47.700
thinking about drugs.

29:50.507 --> 29:51.009
She was bad,

29:51.010 --> 29:53.488
and I know I was a hell of
a lot worse than she was,

29:53.489 --> 29:54.667
so, uh...

29:56.091 --> 29:58.550
I'm sorry for making you drag me in there.

29:58.565 --> 30:01.232
Well, Rayna was the one that
saved your life, not me.

30:02.950 --> 30:04.802
You holding on to something, buddy.

30:06.407 --> 30:08.065
It's time to let it go, okay?

30:24.663 --> 30:26.347
She dropped 'em on our way in.

30:27.266 --> 30:28.427
There's seven in there. I know.

30:28.428 --> 30:30.167
I counted 'em all night,

30:31.245 --> 30:32.680
over and over.

30:34.301 --> 30:36.516
There's still seven. You
can count 'em if you want.

30:36.517 --> 30:37.371
Where you going?

30:37.372 --> 30:38.517
I don't know.

30:53.882 --> 30:57.007
I didn't mean for him to
involve you, Mr. Wyatt.

30:57.639 --> 31:00.289
Teddy's like a son to me. I can help him.

31:00.439 --> 31:01.713
And I can help you.

31:02.183 --> 31:04.444
These audits... they come and go.

31:04.445 --> 31:06.820
I can make sure that your
interview never happens.

31:06.821 --> 31:08.383
Oh, I hope so.

31:08.677 --> 31:12.366
I don't want to go to jail
for doing someone a favor.

31:12.533 --> 31:15.186
But I'm gonna need you
to do one thing for me.

31:15.605 --> 31:16.766
What's that?

31:17.989 --> 31:19.343
You say nothing.

31:19.525 --> 31:21.055
Betray nothing.

31:21.847 --> 31:23.759
Just go to work, stay calm.

31:24.165 --> 31:26.576
You do that, and nothing bad'll happen.

31:28.005 --> 31:29.784
How do you know that?

31:30.109 --> 31:32.641
If you even have to ask that,
Peggy, you weren't listening.

31:32.642 --> 31:34.093
Just do what I say.

31:34.996 --> 31:36.333
Do you understand?

31:38.083 --> 31:39.164
Yes, sir.

31:40.691 --> 31:41.725
Good.

31:56.013 --> 31:57.399
It's good to see you all here tonight.

just got this furniture.

She's not here tonight, just us...

34:20.659 --> 34:22.991
our Thursday night gig here. Uh...

34:22.992 --> 34:25.210
I like it better when she sings.

34:26.481 --> 34:27.755
Most people do.

34:29.708 --> 34:31.478
Two, three, four.

34:43.716 --> 34:47.742

played bass on "laid back"?

Charlie Daniels band Charlie hayward.

34:56.213 --> 34:57.662
You still pissed at me?

34:58.485 --> 34:59.758
We didn't get it.

35:02.180 --> 35:04.480
In fact, you know what that
producer guy said about it?

35:05.589 --> 35:06.512
He said, um...

35:06.513 --> 35:11.227
"Oh, the song the backup
guitarist hijacked?"

35:12.444 --> 35:13.496
What?

35:15.309 --> 35:16.984
It wasn't your big shot.

35:18.173 --> 35:20.105
That was our big shot,
and you screwed it up

35:20.106 --> 35:21.433
because you're so jealous of Gunnar.

35:21.434 --> 35:22.213
That's ridiculous.

35:22.214 --> 35:24.126
No, it is... just stop!

35:27.445 --> 35:30.383
I told him, and I'm telling you.

35:31.637 --> 35:32.927
I choose you.

35:35.189 --> 35:38.543
I always choose you every time, and I...

35:38.937 --> 35:40.436
I don't know when you're
gonna start believing it

35:40.437 --> 35:43.166

prove it all the time.

I have a collect call from...

37:13.403 --> 37:14.436
Deacon.

37:15.354 --> 37:18.396
An inmate from the west
Nashville detention facility.

Nobody.

37:40.658 --> 37:42.140
There was nobody there.

37:58.634 --> 37:59.796
I disagree.

38:01.802 --> 38:02.933
Are you talking to me?

38:06.570 --> 38:07.748
I, uh...

38:08.682 --> 38:10.596
I thought about it, and...

38:10.890 --> 38:12.164
I disagree.

38:13.562 --> 38:17.075
You wanna have all these rules
so that nobody gets hurt,

38:17.625 --> 38:21.180
which really just means that
we pretend not to care,

38:21.746 --> 38:23.484
xx

38:24.114 --> 38:25.693
we can act like we're fine.

38:26.930 --> 38:29.772
But what if I don't want to be just fine?

38:34.353 --> 38:35.484
I like you.

38:37.203 --> 38:39.791
I want things between us
to have a chance to get...

38:41.142 --> 38:42.288
Complicated.

38:45.989 --> 38:48.848
How... complicated?

39:26.263 --> 39:27.296
Thank you.

39:28.439 --> 39:29.344
Yeah.

39:29.766 --> 39:32.223
That's what friends do...
they bail each other out.

39:33.621 --> 39:34.805
Looks like I'm not the only one

39:34.806 --> 39:36.656
who can get myself into trouble.

39:36.774 --> 39:38.576
No, I'm pretty good at it,

39:39.301 --> 39:41.169
especially when I dig my heels in.

39:43.350 --> 39:44.448
Want a ride?

39:45.446 --> 39:46.448
Yeah.

39:51.686 --> 39:53.007
If we do this,

39:53.478 --> 39:55.039
if we go this negative,

39:55.767 --> 39:57.408
you know what's gonna happen.

39:57.974 --> 39:58.856
Rayna's gonna flip,

39:58.857 --> 40:00.744
and Coleman's gonna release
the hounds of hell.

40:00.745 --> 40:02.560
Yeah, well, if we don't do it,

40:03.044 --> 40:05.454
I can guarantee you we're gonna lose.

40:08.837 --> 40:10.287
Do you wanna win or not?

40:11.732 --> 40:13.007
I wanna win.

40:15.361 --> 40:16.352
What'd you think?

40:16.353 --> 40:17.419
I loved it.

Good. I loved it.

Marshall Evans and tell him
