WEBVTT

00:08.967 --> 00:11.345
Lieutenant Lara Hill.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.639
Stop number 46
on the Boredom Express.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.599
Cheer up. This could be fun.

00:15.766 --> 00:19.603
lf l wanted to knock on doors all day,
l would have joined UPS.

00:19.811 --> 00:22.564
Trust me, brown
is not your most flattering colour.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.359
You're actually enjoying this,
aren't you?

00:25.526 --> 00:27.611
We're looking for a mole
in the Pentagon, Tony.

00:27.778 --> 00:30.614
Espionage just so happens
to be one of my specialities.

00:32.073 --> 00:35.118
We're interviewing code geeks.

00:35.285 --> 00:38.121
- They're not sure there is a mole.
- Don't you find it a bit coincidental

00:38.288 --> 00:40.582
that every time the Navy breaks
a Venezuelan code,

00:40.791 --> 00:42.251
it changes almost instantly?

00:42.709 --> 00:44.628
All right. l'm trying the back door.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.512
Relax, Ziva David.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.640
We're dealing with a Naval officer.
Not Dr. Evil.

00:56.807 --> 00:59.518
Well, she didn't show up
for work or her interview with us.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.311
No one's been able
to reach her by phone.

01:01.478 --> 01:04.605
- She probably overslept.
- l believe in being prepared.

01:04.772 --> 01:06.275
So do Boy Scouts.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.652
Why didn't you bring
Webelos McGee with you?

01:08.819 --> 01:10.070
l tried.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.406
He was busy.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.700
l've got an idea.

01:14.867 --> 01:17.411
How about if l shove you
right through here, huh?

01:21.039 --> 01:24.960
Don't tell me you're afraid
of a little pussy cat, Tony?

01:31.300 --> 01:33.343
Looks like blood.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.624
l knew something was wrong
when l got out of the car, probie.

02:30.001 --> 02:31.711
lnstinct. Pure and simple.

02:31.878 --> 02:35.339
- You either you got it or you don't.
- Yeah, well l heard you squealed

02:35.506 --> 02:37.884
like a little squirrel
when the cat jumped out at you.

02:38.509 --> 02:42.179
l was saving this for Ziva,
but since you volunteered.

02:43.431 --> 02:47.977
Find the little beast.
Got blood on his paws. lt's evidence.

02:48.144 --> 02:52.523
- l'm allergic to cats.
- Oh, l'm sorry. l had no idea.

02:53.065 --> 02:55.443
Try holding your breath.

02:55.610 --> 02:58.154
Our lieutenant suffered
from a single gunshot wound,

02:58.362 --> 03:00.364
Jethro, to the right temple.

03:02.241 --> 03:05.161
- Through and through.
- Yeah.

03:08.664 --> 03:11.042
lmpacted here.

03:13.461 --> 03:14.879
Round's still in the book, Duck.

03:15.046 --> 03:19.050
- Sadly, one less reader in the world.
- Who committed suicide.

03:19.842 --> 03:23.596
Or maybe she was just cleaning
her gun too close to her head.

03:25.223 --> 03:27.600
- DiNozzo.
- NClS investigates all suicides

03:27.808 --> 03:31.187
- as homicides until proven otherwise.
- Got it.

03:33.689 --> 03:36.234
- TOD, Duck?
- Nine, 9:30 this morning.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.528
What time was her interview
scheduled for today?

03:38.986 --> 03:41.697
- 1 000.
- Gibbs.

03:44.575 --> 03:46.953
Found it
taped underneath the bureau.

03:50.498 --> 03:51.499
Hundreds and fifties.

03:52.291 --> 03:55.253
Nonsequential.
Maybe 50, 60 grand.

03:55.419 --> 03:57.421
Looks like we found our mole, boss.

03:57.588 --> 04:00.258
Knew she was cornered,
no way out.

04:00.424 --> 04:03.427
- NClS closing in.
- She could have run, Tony.

04:03.594 --> 04:06.305
Suicide is only for when you know
you're going to be captured.

04:06.472 --> 04:09.267
For you, maybe. This doesn't
exactly look like the bedroom

04:09.433 --> 04:10.977
of a hard-core
super-secret agent chick.

04:11.435 --> 04:12.937
l have stuffed animals.

04:17.108 --> 04:20.444
- Okay, l was 1 2. But still, l mean--
- She could have been coerced.

04:20.611 --> 04:22.488
- To be a mole?
- He means to kill herself.

04:22.655 --> 04:24.574
l mean both, DiNozzo.

04:24.740 --> 04:28.244
How many suicides you know make
their beds before they off themselves?

04:28.411 --> 04:30.621
Want me to inform Hill's
command about her death, boss?

04:30.788 --> 04:32.331
- Nope.
- He wants to tell them himself.

04:32.498 --> 04:34.458
- That way he can gauge the response.
- DiNozzo.

04:34.625 --> 04:36.002
On your six, boss.

04:36.168 --> 04:38.087
Get the couch, bookcase
and carpets to Abby.

04:38.588 --> 04:39.964
Oh, on it.

04:40.131 --> 04:42.133
- McGee.
- Yeah, boss.

04:53.102 --> 04:54.353
He's really quick, boss.

04:55.146 --> 04:57.857
All right, l'll hold. McGee,
you go that way. l'll go this way.

04:58.024 --> 05:01.027
We'll corner the guy. You've gotta be
very careful with animals.

05:01.194 --> 05:03.112
They're tricky.

05:09.702 --> 05:11.454
Hey.

05:17.168 --> 05:18.336
Or you could just do that.

05:19.503 --> 05:21.047
With me.
We're going to the Pentagon.

05:21.505 --> 05:23.633
- Cryptology unit?
- l need you to translate.

05:23.841 --> 05:25.718
He needs you to speak
the geek for him, McGee.

05:25.885 --> 05:27.511
DiNozzo, find a home for that thing.

05:36.354 --> 05:37.522
Sir.

05:49.242 --> 05:52.161
Agent Gibbs. l understand
you've got an investigation to run,

05:52.328 --> 05:53.871
but l'd appreciate a courtesy call

05:54.038 --> 05:56.499
before you show up here
to interview any more of my people.

05:56.707 --> 05:59.252
We're not here to interview
your people today, Captain Dorn.

06:00.044 --> 06:02.588
- What happened?
- Lieutenant Hill.

06:02.964 --> 06:05.675
Well, what? She didn't show up
for her interview at NClS today?

06:05.883 --> 06:07.301
- Nope.
- lf she's running late,

06:07.468 --> 06:10.680
- l can tell you there's a good reason.
- We know the reason.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.349
She's dead.

06:14.725 --> 06:17.687
- How?
- Appears to be suicide.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.399
Let's continue this conversation
in my office.

06:30.199 --> 06:32.493
These cryptographers,
they're not like us.

06:32.702 --> 06:35.079
Their lives are about patterns
and numbers.

06:35.246 --> 06:37.707
Tell you the truth,
l don't understand half of it.

06:37.915 --> 06:40.251
But they're tightly wound,
and Lt. Hill was no different.

06:40.418 --> 06:44.005
- You're saying she was suicidal?
- l'm saying that she was withdrawn.

06:44.213 --> 06:46.757
She was socially awkward,
had obsessive-compulsive traits.

06:46.924 --> 06:48.926
Well, none of that
was in her medical record.

06:49.393 --> 06:50.477
No, and it wouldn't be.

06:50.686 --> 06:52.771
These people are recruited
based on their abilities

06:52.938 --> 06:55.399
and sometimes it's a thin line
between genius and--

06:55.566 --> 06:57.067
lnsanity.

06:57.234 --> 06:59.862
Look, a lot of these people
tend to be naturally paranoid

07:00.029 --> 07:03.407
and this mole hunt hasn't helped.
My entire section's on edge.

07:03.574 --> 07:05.075
They should be.

07:05.242 --> 07:07.077
lf there's a leak,
l am telling you right now,

07:07.244 --> 07:08.579
it is not coming from my people.

07:09.330 --> 07:11.874
We found $60,000 hidden
in Lieutenant Hill's home.

07:12.082 --> 07:15.211
She ended up dead instead of
attending the interview she had today.

07:15.377 --> 07:16.462
What does that tell you?

07:21.592 --> 07:23.052
<i>- Lieutenant Hall?
- Sir?</i>

07:23.219 --> 07:25.763
We are now in lockdown.
l want all the work secured

07:25.971 --> 07:28.766
and the section restricted
to quarters until further notice.

07:29.475 --> 07:30.935
Yes, sir.

07:31.101 --> 07:33.771
<i>Attention! lnitiate emergency
plan Alpha.</i>

07:33.979 --> 07:36.190
<i>Shut down your systems
and secure classified material.</i>

07:36.398 --> 07:37.942
<i>When complete,
report to your quarters</i>

07:38.108 --> 07:39.735
<i>until further notice.</i>

07:46.534 --> 07:48.452
Okay.

07:48.953 --> 07:50.120
What now?

07:54.625 --> 07:56.126
Hey, buddy.

07:57.127 --> 07:58.295
Look what l got.

07:58.462 --> 08:00.506
Who found your favourite
little carrot toy?

08:00.673 --> 08:02.967
Come here. Come here. Okay.

08:03.133 --> 08:05.511
Here's a carrot. Yeah.

08:05.678 --> 08:08.055
Good kitty.

08:11.267 --> 08:13.269
You think that's funny,
probies? Huh?

08:14.603 --> 08:16.897
Getting a chuckle back here
in the peanut gallery? ls that it?

08:17.773 --> 08:19.650
Wanna know how that blood
got there?

08:19.817 --> 08:23.571
You think that's funny?
l'll tell you how it got there.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.157
Garfield, over there.

08:28.617 --> 08:31.453
We found that animal
feasting on this woman's face.

08:32.121 --> 08:36.167
Dr. Mallard
thinks that this kitty-cat is rabid.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.751
Me?

08:37.960 --> 08:41.046
l'm of the opinion
that it's a man-eater.

08:41.212 --> 08:44.717
lt likes the taste of human flesh.
lt starts with the cheeks.

08:45.176 --> 08:47.720
Then it moves to the lips.
The soft bits.

08:47.887 --> 08:51.015
Then it works on the tongue
a little bit until it's just a little nub.

08:51.182 --> 08:53.142
A lot of blood in the tongue.
A geyser of blood

08:53.309 --> 08:55.352
spewing from this
poor woman's maw.

08:55.519 --> 08:58.189
Get a kick out of this now?
You think this is funny, chucklehead?

08:58.355 --> 09:00.357
That's what it was feasting on
when we found it.

09:00.524 --> 09:02.985
- lt took four tranquilizers--
- That's very dramatic, Tony.

09:03.194 --> 09:04.528
Can we get back to work now?

09:04.695 --> 09:06.864
You heard the lady, probies.

09:07.031 --> 09:09.366
And careful with that,
because it is evidence.

09:11.577 --> 09:12.661
l never get tired of it.

09:12.870 --> 09:14.580
- What'd you find?
- Neighbours were at work.

09:14.747 --> 09:17.708
The woman next door, she was there
but she didn't hear anything.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.877
Wish l had a neighbour like that.

09:20.044 --> 09:23.714
Old bat that lives next to me
complains every time l bring a date.

09:23.881 --> 09:26.425
- Wanna know why?
- Shouting of, ''No means no!''?

09:26.592 --> 09:28.802
That's a good one,
but not even close.

09:29.011 --> 09:30.262
l was actually kidding.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.224
l have the same problem
at my place, Tony.

09:33.390 --> 09:35.851
Really? You have
a surround-sound system too?

09:36.060 --> 09:40.064
No. l'm what you Americans
like to call a ''screamer,'' yes?

09:44.276 --> 09:46.612
- Answer it.
- Well, what do you want me to say?

09:46.779 --> 09:48.155
l don't know. Scream something.

09:48.322 --> 09:50.324
<i>This is Lara. Leave a message.</i>

09:50.491 --> 09:53.577
<i>Hi, Miss Hill. This is Bob calling
with a special offer.</i>

09:54.620 --> 09:56.622
Hello, this is Special Agent
Anthony DiNozzo.

09:56.789 --> 09:59.124
You've called a crime scene.
We're wiretapping this phone,

09:59.291 --> 10:01.377
so please be advised
that we will be contacting you

10:01.544 --> 10:02.920
<i>- at your home.
- My home?</i>

10:03.087 --> 10:04.922
Any time, day or night.
Probably the weekend,

10:05.089 --> 10:07.132
<i>- early in the morning.
- Oh, hello--</i>

10:07.299 --> 10:09.593
That was fun. Telemarketers.

10:09.802 --> 10:12.763
You can't escape them
even when you're dead.

10:13.055 --> 10:15.266
Speaking about escape.

10:22.565 --> 10:24.316
Nobody move.

10:27.111 --> 10:32.449
To assume is to make an enemy
of exactitude, Mr. Palmer.

10:32.616 --> 10:34.743
Because it makes an
ass out of you and me.

10:34.952 --> 10:37.913
ls this the best time
for an attempt at humour?

10:38.080 --> 10:39.456
No.

10:39.623 --> 10:42.418
We must strive for excellence,
Mr. Palmer.

10:45.337 --> 10:47.882
- Go the extra mile.
- l understand.

10:48.090 --> 10:50.134
Do you, now? Well, that's good.

10:51.343 --> 10:53.888
What exactly was
your assumption?

10:54.096 --> 10:57.474
Well, the instant gunshot
residue test came back positive.

10:57.683 --> 11:00.144
- Yeah.
- She had a pistol in her hand.

11:01.478 --> 11:02.813
She has a hole in her head.

11:03.022 --> 11:05.566
lt would seem reasonable
to conclude suicide, sir.

11:05.733 --> 11:08.486
There's nothing reasonable
about a lovely young girl like this

11:08.652 --> 11:11.989
taking her life
in such a grotesque fashion.

11:12.156 --> 11:17.286
lt's true firearms are the most common
instrument of suicide.

11:17.453 --> 11:20.998
However, women tend to avoid
the proximity of the face

11:21.165 --> 11:23.042
when pulling the trigger.

11:23.209 --> 11:25.127
Vanity, Mr. Palmer.

11:25.336 --> 11:26.504
Simple vanity.

11:28.714 --> 11:30.799
We're not finished
with the external exam, are we, sir?

11:30.966 --> 11:32.343
Well, you're not.

11:32.510 --> 11:36.180
You're so sure
that the cause of death was suicide.

11:36.347 --> 11:39.767
Why don't you work out
how you would prove it?

11:39.975 --> 11:41.352
You want me to--?

11:41.519 --> 11:44.897
Finish the external exam.
Clean, measure, you know, the usual.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.857
You think you can do that?

11:47.525 --> 11:48.609
Absolutely, doctor.

11:48.818 --> 11:52.029
Then work through the procedure,
item by item.

11:52.196 --> 11:55.032
- Make whatever notes you can.
- Right.

11:55.908 --> 11:59.328
- Thank you, doctor.
- Have her ready for autopsy.

11:59.662 --> 12:01.539
- Two o'clock, tomorrow.
- Yeah.

12:09.713 --> 12:12.508
- That's why l never had pets.
- You've never had any pets?

12:12.883 --> 12:15.594
- Well, l had Sea-Monkeys once.
- What's a Sea-Monkey?

12:16.345 --> 12:19.181
Basically, brine shrimp
swimming around in green water.

12:20.266 --> 12:23.185
- l know, l thought the same thing.
- What happened to them?

12:23.352 --> 12:26.564
My mother got their sea castles
confused with her mint julep.

12:26.730 --> 12:30.568
- Your mother drank your monkeys?
- lt was the '70s.

12:30.734 --> 12:33.612
- Explains a lot, DiNozzo.
- Went through Lt. Hill's background.

12:33.779 --> 12:36.907
Her phone records, credit card bills,
personal habits.

12:37.074 --> 12:40.244
- No discernible patterns.
- Yet. She's a cryptographer, Ziva.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.454
We could be dealing
with a real pro here, boss.

12:42.621 --> 12:46.041
Well, DiNozzo, if she was a pro,
she wouldn't have killed herself.

12:49.545 --> 12:50.963
<i>You should have heard
this guy, Abby.</i>

12:51.130 --> 12:54.216
Just because someone has
an aptitude for math and science,

12:54.383 --> 12:57.887
it does not make them
some kind of suicidal freak.

12:58.053 --> 13:00.055
A little higher, McGee.

13:00.723 --> 13:03.767
- ls that what people think about us?
- Ask me later, McGee.

13:05.895 --> 13:08.105
- Oh, this better be work-related.
- Oh, it is.

13:08.314 --> 13:11.025
And you're just in time
for the show-and-tell portion.

13:11.192 --> 13:12.735
McGee, if you will.

13:13.444 --> 13:16.280
So Lieutenant Hill sits down
on the couch,

13:16.447 --> 13:19.116
puts the gun to her head and:

13:20.075 --> 13:22.536
l said, ''bang,'' McGee.

13:22.745 --> 13:25.289
l matched the bullet found
in the book

13:25.456 --> 13:28.501
to the Kahr 9 mm in the victim's hand.
Looks like a suicide, right?

13:28.667 --> 13:31.295
- Except?
- When a weapon is used at this range

13:31.462 --> 13:33.672
there's extensive blood splatter
from the exit wound.

13:33.839 --> 13:37.593
But blowback also creates
a fine mist of blood which lands here.

13:38.928 --> 13:40.638
lmperceptible to the human eye,

13:41.597 --> 13:45.017
but not to the magic
of modern science.

13:45.184 --> 13:47.186
You're still dead, McGee.

13:47.353 --> 13:49.438
- And?
- Two steps away.

13:51.148 --> 13:52.650
Voila.

13:54.985 --> 13:57.530
- Footprints.
- Exactly. Which means?

13:57.696 --> 13:59.990
Somebody else was in the room.

14:06.414 --> 14:07.999
No evidence of forced entry.

14:08.249 --> 14:13.004
No bruises or marks to show
that she was forced to pull the trigger

14:13.171 --> 14:14.922
or unconscious when she died.

14:16.591 --> 14:18.801
All we have is this.

14:18.968 --> 14:21.054
Rorschach test from hell.

14:21.220 --> 14:23.514
You believe Abby may be mistaken?

14:23.723 --> 14:27.143
Well, l believe it's gonna be tough
to prove the suicide was faked

14:27.310 --> 14:29.354
when all you got
is two partial footprints.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.315
She could have been drugged.
The killer could have placed the pistol

14:32.482 --> 14:35.777
- in her hand and pulled the trigger.
- The initial tox screens were negative.

14:36.819 --> 14:38.696
Some narcotics are hard to trace.

14:38.905 --> 14:42.200
And as for no evidence of forced entry,
we could be dealing with an assassin.

14:42.367 --> 14:45.036
Or she knew her killer, Ziva.
Probie, it's about time.

14:45.244 --> 14:46.496
l'm starving like Lee Marvin.

14:47.372 --> 14:50.166
Well, then you shouldn't have sent me
for the world's greatest barbecue.

14:50.333 --> 14:51.959
Because l had to wait in line
for an hour.

14:52.126 --> 14:53.294
But it will be worth it.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.172
Welcome.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.676
Hey, boss.

15:02.470 --> 15:05.223
Did you want something too,
because, well,

15:05.390 --> 15:08.017
it's just that you never order.
l can go back. l'll go back.

15:08.518 --> 15:09.936
Sit down.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.815
No one has earned dinner yet.

15:13.982 --> 15:16.442
l agree, though l doubt
this qualifies as dinner.

15:16.609 --> 15:18.736
ln fact, l'm not even sure
what this is.

15:18.903 --> 15:22.198
- A Sea-Monkey?
- Goat. l'm pretty sure it's kosher.

15:22.365 --> 15:26.703
Maybe, but still disgusting.

15:28.997 --> 15:32.208
There is a mole in the Pentagon
and our only lead lies dead

15:32.375 --> 15:34.919
on a slab in Autopsy.
l want answers.

15:35.086 --> 15:37.547
Boss, ran the serial number
on the murder weapon

15:37.755 --> 15:40.133
found in Hill's apartment.
Just got a match.

15:40.341 --> 15:43.177
Purchased six months ago
by this woman.

15:43.386 --> 15:45.930
Lieutenant Keira Napleton?
We just--

15:46.097 --> 15:48.558
lnterviewed her last week.
She's in the same crypto unit as Hill.

15:48.766 --> 15:51.102
Looks like we didn't do
such a good job.

15:52.186 --> 15:54.272
- We'll bring her in.
- DiNozzo.

15:55.815 --> 15:59.027
We'll bring her in now.
We'll eat dinner later.

16:15.209 --> 16:17.045
Good goat.

16:24.886 --> 16:26.346
l'm Special Agent Gibbs.

16:26.637 --> 16:31.601
Keira Nap-- l mean,
Lieutenant Keira Napleton, sir.

16:31.768 --> 16:32.935
Middle name, lngBall.

16:33.102 --> 16:35.563
Family name on my father's side.
Most people would find it--

16:35.772 --> 16:39.901
You're not here
because of a middle name, lieutenant.

16:40.068 --> 16:41.653
This woman is a total turd.

16:43.696 --> 16:46.074
- A geek, yes?
- The term is ''nerd.''

16:46.240 --> 16:48.534
Whatever. l'm saying,
it's hard to picture her as a killer.

16:48.910 --> 16:52.413
Remember the time that we Super
Glued McGeek's face to his desk?

16:53.998 --> 16:55.500
Yeah, that's a good point.

16:57.794 --> 17:01.964
Am l to assume
l'm in some form of legal trouble?

17:02.131 --> 17:04.217
l only ask because
no one has informed me

17:04.384 --> 17:07.637
of my Article 31 rights yet, sir.

17:08.471 --> 17:10.098
Want me to read them to you?

17:10.263 --> 17:14.310
- Actually, l have them memorized.
- Good. That'll save time.

17:14.935 --> 17:17.146
l was interviewed by NClS, sir.

17:17.313 --> 17:20.983
l am not a traitor to my country.

17:27.198 --> 17:28.825
How about her?

17:29.325 --> 17:31.369
You think Lara was the mole?

17:32.286 --> 17:34.831
- Tell me about her.
- Well,

17:35.039 --> 17:37.500
she was Catholic,
liked to play softball.

17:37.709 --> 17:39.502
Her left leg was longer
than her right.

17:39.669 --> 17:42.213
l'm more interested
in her being dead, lieutenant.

17:44.632 --> 17:46.759
l don't know, sir.

17:47.176 --> 17:49.429
Perhaps she was depressed?

17:49.721 --> 17:52.098
Enough to blow her head off?

17:54.017 --> 17:56.144
She shot herself?

17:57.937 --> 18:02.025
With this.
A Kahr 9 mm. Yours.

18:02.442 --> 18:04.277
<i>What was that doing in her house?</i>

18:05.361 --> 18:09.198
<i>The real estate market,
being what it is--</i>

18:09.365 --> 18:11.159
And the forecasted projections
over the next--

18:11.326 --> 18:12.827
Lieutenant!

18:13.369 --> 18:16.372
l have orders for Norfolk, sir.

18:16.539 --> 18:17.999
So l sold my townhouse.

18:18.166 --> 18:21.753
Lara let me stay with her
until l shipped out.

18:22.587 --> 18:25.882
- Convenient.
- Most people would think so,

18:26.049 --> 18:27.383
but the commute wasn't better--

18:27.550 --> 18:31.554
Meaning, she wasn't alone
when the trigger was pulled.

18:33.389 --> 18:36.434
You think l was there with her?

18:38.102 --> 18:41.272
Sir, if l was,
l would have stopped her.

18:41.564 --> 18:42.940
Where were you?

18:44.400 --> 18:46.653
l was at Alphonse's last night.

18:47.070 --> 18:48.071
My boyfriend.

18:48.571 --> 18:50.156
<i>l went straight to work
from his house.</i>

18:51.115 --> 18:53.910
- l don't believe it.
- She appears to be telling the truth.

18:54.077 --> 18:56.079
No, l mean the part
about her having a boyfriend.

18:58.581 --> 18:59.582
Come on.

19:01.709 --> 19:03.544
l need his number and address.

19:06.506 --> 19:12.470
l'd appreciate it
if you kept this quiet, Agent Gibbs.

19:14.430 --> 19:16.641
My parents--

19:17.600 --> 19:19.310
They still think l'm a virgin.

19:22.397 --> 19:24.774
How much longer
is this gonna take, Agent McGee?

19:24.983 --> 19:26.693
Hard to say, captain.

19:26.859 --> 19:29.529
Agent Gibbs doesn't like
to be interrupted during interrogation.

19:29.696 --> 19:30.863
lt's almost 0200 in the morning.

19:31.072 --> 19:33.241
We're just getting started
here, skipper.

19:33.408 --> 19:36.619
Agent Gibbs, do you think
Lieutenant Napleton's the mole?

19:37.036 --> 19:38.997
She's staying here
until we check her alibi.

19:39.539 --> 19:40.707
Alibi? For what?

19:42.125 --> 19:43.710
lt's too soon to say.

19:43.876 --> 19:46.087
Well, we have
another problem now.

19:46.254 --> 19:47.797
Security may have been
compromised.

19:48.464 --> 19:50.008
- May have?
- After you left today,

19:50.174 --> 19:52.301
l conducted a thorough inventory
of our section.

19:52.468 --> 19:54.470
Every piece of technology
was scrutinized.

19:54.637 --> 19:56.097
Do you know what this is?

19:56.597 --> 20:00.810
Yeah. lt's one of those memory
doodah things for a computer.

20:00.977 --> 20:04.147
Yeah, basically we use it
to transfer data between terminals.

20:04.314 --> 20:06.024
At night they're checked in,
kept in a vault.

20:06.190 --> 20:09.610
They never leave the section.
l found this today in its proper place.

20:09.777 --> 20:11.321
The only problem is...

20:14.198 --> 20:16.576
...someone took
the memory cartridge out.

20:16.784 --> 20:19.454
- Who has access to the vault?
- Two people:

20:19.620 --> 20:21.372
Lieutenant Hill
and Lieutenant Napleton.

20:21.539 --> 20:22.790
What was on it?

20:22.957 --> 20:25.251
Could be anything.
lt holds over two gigs of information.

20:25.418 --> 20:27.795
McGee, bag it. Get ahold
of Ziva and Tony,

20:27.962 --> 20:31.799
- tell them we're heading out.
- l got it. Where to, boss?

20:31.966 --> 20:34.344
To look for the other doodah that goes
inside that one.

20:34.552 --> 20:37.555
- On it.
- Agent Gibbs, this is my fault.

20:38.639 --> 20:40.933
l've already offered my resignation
to the admiral.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.227
Don't fall on your sword yet,
captain. Like l said,

20:43.436 --> 20:44.771
we're just getting started here.

20:50.193 --> 20:52.236
That flash card could be anywhere.

20:52.403 --> 20:54.864
lf you find it, though,
try not to touch the contacts.

20:56.282 --> 20:59.035
Mossad training does not
include food service.

21:02.664 --> 21:04.123
This thing hasn't been cleaned
in years.

21:04.290 --> 21:05.750
lt's a heating duct, McGee.

21:05.917 --> 21:10.129
Nobody cleans heating ducts.
Except for you, that is.

21:10.296 --> 21:12.131
God, it smells like
it's been here for a month.

21:12.298 --> 21:14.509
That's exactly why
l don't have a roommate.

21:14.717 --> 21:16.552
Roommates are never a good idea.

21:16.719 --> 21:19.806
- Did you ever have one, boss?
- Three, McGee.

21:19.972 --> 21:21.432
They're called wives.

22:07.895 --> 22:08.980
Pack up. l found it.

22:12.108 --> 22:14.986
Looks like they're putting decoder rings
in cereal boxes again.

22:19.324 --> 22:20.950
What?

22:21.576 --> 22:23.953
A little before our time, boss.

22:32.628 --> 22:33.713
Find anything, Abby?

22:33.921 --> 22:36.799
l pulled a partial print
off the flash card. l'm running it now.

22:37.383 --> 22:38.634
Rough night?

22:38.801 --> 22:40.261
ls there any other kind with Gibbs?

22:40.428 --> 22:42.555
lt could be worse.
lt could be Saturday.

22:42.764 --> 22:44.766
lt is Saturday, Abby.

22:44.932 --> 22:46.809
See? lt just got worse. Thanks.

22:46.976 --> 22:48.144
Do you have any Super Glue, Abs?

22:48.394 --> 22:50.021
What did l tell you
about that, DiNozzo?

22:50.980 --> 22:53.107
The skin might not grow back.

22:53.316 --> 22:55.151
- What do we have?
- The partial print didn't match

22:55.318 --> 22:57.862
anyone at the crypto unit
so l'm running it through AFlS

22:58.071 --> 22:59.989
- and other databases.
- McGee.

23:00.990 --> 23:03.201
Dumped the contents
of the flash card.

23:03.368 --> 23:06.204
lt's encrypted so we're gonna need
someone from the crypto section

23:06.371 --> 23:08.081
to have access to their codes.

23:08.247 --> 23:10.875
- Captain Dorn is coming in later.
- Whoa, not so fast, Gibbs.

23:11.042 --> 23:12.460
l got a hit.

23:12.627 --> 23:14.879
lt's from the
Office of Foreign Missions.

23:18.174 --> 23:19.884
Name's Simon Roca.

23:20.051 --> 23:23.179
He's the protocol officer
at the embassy of Venezuela.

23:23.388 --> 23:24.931
He's got an apartment
in the Watergate.

23:25.098 --> 23:26.516
Been on station since last June.

23:26.683 --> 23:30.353
lf Hill was selling code, Roca could
be the source of the money we found.

23:30.520 --> 23:33.147
He killed her because she wouldn't
hold under questioning.

23:33.481 --> 23:35.566
- We bringing him in?
- We can't.

23:35.775 --> 23:37.986
Can't? He murdered a Naval officer,
boss.

23:38.152 --> 23:39.862
He has a licence to kill, McGee.

23:40.029 --> 23:43.032
He's got full diplomatic immunity.

23:52.458 --> 23:54.836
<i>What can the State Department do
for NClS</i>

23:55.003 --> 23:57.130
<i>at 7:30 on a Saturday, Agent Gibbs?</i>

23:57.296 --> 23:59.298
l've got a dead Naval officer
who might be a mole.

23:59.465 --> 24:01.759
Evidence connects her
to a foreign diplomat.

24:01.968 --> 24:03.803
<i>- What country?
- Venezuela.</i>

24:04.804 --> 24:06.514
His name is Simon Roca.

24:06.681 --> 24:08.308
<i>Bad choice. Pick another.</i>

24:09.726 --> 24:10.727
l wanna question him.

24:10.935 --> 24:13.688
<i>You're aware of our current
relations with Venezuela?</i>

24:13.855 --> 24:15.315
They're about to get worse.

24:15.481 --> 24:18.609
<i>They've already accused us
of meddling in their internal affairs.</i>

24:18.776 --> 24:20.653
<i>The Venezuelan
petroleum minister has threatened</i>

24:20.820 --> 24:24.157
<i>to cut off future oil shipments and
to close their refineries in the U.S.</i>

24:24.324 --> 24:26.951
Sounds like a real headache.
What time can l question him?

24:27.368 --> 24:29.495
<i>The man has diplomatic immunity,
Agent Gibbs.</i>

24:29.662 --> 24:34.459
The man's a foreign intelligence officer
who murdered a Navy lieutenant.

24:34.959 --> 24:36.044
<i>You have proof of this?</i>

24:36.294 --> 24:38.504
Her death was made to look
like a suicide.

24:38.963 --> 24:39.964
<i>Meaning you can't prove it.</i>

24:40.173 --> 24:43.217
His prints were found
on classified Pentagon hardware

24:43.384 --> 24:45.178
recovered from
the dead woman's home.

24:45.345 --> 24:48.431
<i>The Vienna Convention exists
for a reason, Agent Gibbs.</i>

24:48.598 --> 24:51.893
<i>lf you can prove he committed
murder. l mean, prove--</i>

24:52.060 --> 24:54.687
By the time l prove it,
Roca will have left the country.

24:54.854 --> 24:57.315
<i>Then we take your proof
to the Secretary</i>

24:57.523 --> 24:59.400
<i>and if she signs off on it,</i>

24:59.567 --> 25:02.528
<i>we then ask the Venezuelan Foreign
Mission to waive his immunity.</i>

25:02.695 --> 25:04.822
<i>Not very likely.</i>

25:05.365 --> 25:06.949
And he walks for murder?

25:07.158 --> 25:08.868
<i>l don't make the rules, Agent Gibbs.</i>

25:09.035 --> 25:11.037
<i>l do, however,
expect you to follow them.</i>

25:11.204 --> 25:14.540
<i>Until we give you permission,
you can't question Roca.</i>

25:14.707 --> 25:18.628
<i>Where's he going? Gibbs. Gibbs.</i>

25:37.897 --> 25:40.191
- Hey, boss.
- Nice try, probie.

25:42.777 --> 25:44.696
Power nap, boss.

25:44.862 --> 25:47.323
Doorman at the Watergate hasn't
seen Roca for the past two days.

25:47.490 --> 25:49.075
He's probably holed up
in their embassy.

25:49.283 --> 25:51.369
Take Ziva. Find out.
You can't question him.

25:51.536 --> 25:54.247
Gonna be awful hard to get
answers if l can't ask questions.

25:54.414 --> 25:56.708
DiNozzo, if it was easy,
l would send Joe the janitor.

25:56.874 --> 25:59.252
Customs hasn't checked
his passport in the last 24 hours.

25:59.460 --> 26:01.921
- Most likely still in country.
- Not for long.

26:02.088 --> 26:04.924
The Venezuelan Embassy
booked a private jet this morning

26:05.091 --> 26:07.135
out of Loudoun County Airport.

26:07.885 --> 26:11.097
- To leave when, McGee?
- Sorry. Today.

26:11.264 --> 26:13.725
Simon Roca's name
is listed as a passenger.

26:13.891 --> 26:15.852
We need to tie Roca
to Lieutenant Hill's murder

26:16.019 --> 26:17.603
before he boards that plane.

26:17.770 --> 26:19.480
Go. Go.

26:22.775 --> 26:26.237
How do we prove the lieutenant's
death wasn't a suicide?

26:26.404 --> 26:28.448
- ln a day?
- Abby, l think she was unconscious

26:28.614 --> 26:29.949
when it happened.

26:30.116 --> 26:32.827
lf Ducky can examine the brain
tissue and send me a sample,

26:32.994 --> 26:34.996
- l might be able to prove that.
- Yeah, do it.

26:35.872 --> 26:37.290
Ducky doesn't get in till noon.

26:37.457 --> 26:40.877
Do you want me to call him
or do you want the pleasure--?

26:45.006 --> 26:46.591
You know, l've been thinking, Tony.

26:47.091 --> 26:49.260
Remember when we were locked
in that container?

26:49.427 --> 26:51.095
You said you used
to take piano lessons?

26:51.262 --> 26:53.473
Well, l think you should start again.

26:53.973 --> 26:55.141
l could teach you.

26:55.350 --> 26:57.644
Who knows, maybe it could be fun.

26:58.436 --> 26:59.979
Tony.

27:03.483 --> 27:06.152
But l'm sure you'd make
a lousy student anyway.

27:12.283 --> 27:14.827
- Do it and die, Amadeus.
- l thought you were asleep.

27:15.036 --> 27:17.997
- You thought wrong. l was meditating.
- About?

27:19.457 --> 27:21.584
When you said you were a screamer,
you did mean--

27:21.751 --> 27:23.002
l did.

27:23.503 --> 27:24.671
We've got company.

27:25.838 --> 27:27.090
lt's a restricted zone.

27:27.298 --> 27:29.634
- You can't park here.
- NClS.

27:29.842 --> 27:34.013
We are looking for Venezuelan
Protocol Officer Simon Roca.

27:34.180 --> 27:35.431
Don Juan.

27:35.974 --> 27:38.184
We give them nicknames.
Helps relieve the boredom.

27:38.351 --> 27:42.271
People think Secret Service is like Clint
Eastwood protecting the president.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.357
<i>Yeah, ln the Line of Fire.</i>

27:44.524 --> 27:46.567
- lt's a good movie.
- l wish it were that exciting.

27:46.734 --> 27:47.902
How do you like NClS?

27:48.861 --> 27:50.196
lt has its moments.

27:50.363 --> 27:53.366
- Good hours?
- ls Roca in or not?

27:53.533 --> 27:55.660
As a matter of fact, he is,
which is unusual.

27:55.868 --> 27:57.829
- Why is that?
- l've been here over a year,

27:57.996 --> 27:59.956
Don Juan's never spent
the night before.

28:00.164 --> 28:04.210
Day guy logged him in
1 1 :1 6 a.m. yesterday.

28:04.419 --> 28:05.878
Looks pretty refreshed to me.

28:07.171 --> 28:08.715
Who is that with him?

28:08.881 --> 28:10.216
That's Don Juan's driver.

28:10.383 --> 28:12.343
Looks like they're getting ready
to go for a ride.

28:12.510 --> 28:15.388
- All right, thanks.
- You bet.

28:18.391 --> 28:19.726
<i>- Yeah, Gibbs.
- Hey, boss.</i>

28:19.892 --> 28:21.561
<i>Roca's inside the embassy.
Looks like</i>

28:21.769 --> 28:23.396
he's taking sanctuary till his flight.

28:23.563 --> 28:26.024
Stay on station and set up
a video link to MTAC.

28:26.274 --> 28:29.527
- l wanna know when he moves.
- On it.

28:31.362 --> 28:33.990
You weren't planning
on sleeping, were you?

28:34.157 --> 28:37.577
Not unless you're planning
on taking a shower anytime soon.

28:38.953 --> 28:41.080
What's that supposed to mean?

28:44.083 --> 28:45.793
l don't know about this, Abby.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.796
Dr. Mallard won't even let me
sit in his chair without supervision.

28:48.963 --> 28:51.424
That's because you mess
with the height adjustments, Jimmy.

28:51.632 --> 28:56.596
- You can do this.
- This is not a good idea.

28:56.804 --> 28:59.557
We don't have time to wait
for Ducky on this, okay?

29:00.099 --> 29:01.267
What comes first?

29:01.768 --> 29:03.770
- The saw?
- Careful, okay?

29:03.936 --> 29:05.605
These are all
in a very specific order.

29:05.772 --> 29:08.733
Stop being so ''Palmer,'' Jimmy.

29:09.108 --> 29:12.779
All right. l will need a scalpel.

29:15.448 --> 29:19.452
Jimmy, are you really gonna do this,
or am l?

29:20.745 --> 29:22.288
l'll do it.

29:24.290 --> 29:26.250
What exactly are you two doing?

29:26.417 --> 29:28.127
Oh, l-- Dr. Mallard.

29:28.294 --> 29:32.799
l-- The thing is, l--
She made me do it.

29:32.965 --> 29:34.967
Well, everything seems to be
in order.

29:35.134 --> 29:37.970
Why don't you begin,
Mr. Palmer, while l get changed?

29:38.137 --> 29:39.639
You're not mad?

29:39.806 --> 29:42.934
Work cannot stop, Mr. Palmer,
because my mother's nurse

29:43.101 --> 29:45.478
elects to abandon us
on a Saturday morning.

29:45.645 --> 29:48.314
l applaud your initiative.

29:48.481 --> 29:52.318
- So, what did you do with your mom?
- Donald.

29:53.486 --> 29:56.030
You promised me
we were going for a ride.

29:56.197 --> 29:58.366
We did go for a ride, Mother.

29:58.533 --> 30:00.994
Oh, well very well.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.162
You drive too fast, Donald.

30:03.329 --> 30:05.164
ls that our housekeeper?

30:05.999 --> 30:10.378
Mother, Mrs. Leary left
for lreland ten years ago.

30:10.586 --> 30:13.840
- Hello, Mrs. Mallard.
- Hello.

30:14.007 --> 30:17.010
Ask the boy to pour me a drink.

30:17.176 --> 30:20.763
We're not at home, Mother.
And Jimmy is not a servant.

30:20.972 --> 30:23.891
Very well. l shall do it myself.

30:25.310 --> 30:28.688
Abby, would you do me a favour?

30:28.855 --> 30:32.692
- l mean, just until we finish?
- Oh, lovely single malt--

30:32.859 --> 30:34.861
Of course.

30:38.823 --> 30:40.825
Mrs. Mallard?

30:40.992 --> 30:43.328
Would you like to see
my mass spectrometer?

30:45.747 --> 30:51.836
What a charming young lady.
Of course l would, my dear.

30:52.628 --> 30:55.006
What is a mass speedometer?

30:55.256 --> 30:57.508
Does it move very fast?

30:57.675 --> 30:59.427
Well....

31:04.390 --> 31:05.642
Can l ask you a question?

31:06.184 --> 31:07.935
Yes.

31:08.895 --> 31:11.105
You really think l smell?

31:13.399 --> 31:14.651
l was just kidding.

31:17.945 --> 31:19.906
- What about now?
- You are disgusting.

31:20.073 --> 31:21.991
You do that again and l'll shoot you.

31:22.742 --> 31:25.495
- Got it?
- Start the car.

31:25.662 --> 31:27.538
What good will that do
when you're still in it?

31:40.760 --> 31:43.388
- lt's Roca's car.
- Gibbs, Roca's leaving.

31:43.554 --> 31:46.015
Boss, the private jet he booked
is refuelled, standing by.

31:48.101 --> 31:50.895
Diplomat's car is considered
foreign soil.

31:51.062 --> 31:52.730
lt's as sovereign as the embassy.

31:53.940 --> 31:55.733
What do we do?

31:56.943 --> 31:58.611
Delay him.

31:59.946 --> 32:01.406
Okay, here we go.

32:05.326 --> 32:10.790
Hippopotamus amphibious.
The river horse.

32:11.124 --> 32:17.630
l once swam with them
while l was on safari in Kenya.

32:17.839 --> 32:20.591
Oh, dear. My apologies.

32:20.758 --> 32:23.636
No. That's Bert, the hippo.
He's supposed to do that.

32:23.803 --> 32:25.305
Really?

32:26.597 --> 32:28.266
How delightful.

32:30.435 --> 32:33.813
Reminds me
of my bagpipe-playing days.

32:34.272 --> 32:35.648
Did you know,

32:35.815 --> 32:40.486
that without those longshoremen
tattoos and that dog collar,

32:40.987 --> 32:43.948
you are the exact spitting image

32:44.115 --> 32:46.034
- of my sister Gloria?
- Thank you.

32:46.367 --> 32:47.618
l hated her.

32:47.785 --> 32:49.829
She once tried to sleep
with my late husband

32:49.996 --> 32:52.040
- while he was still alive.
- Mother!

32:53.374 --> 32:56.419
l'm sure Abigail doesn't want to hear
any more of our family troubles.

32:56.627 --> 32:58.546
lt's fine, Ducky.
We're having a good time.

32:58.713 --> 33:00.131
Brain tissue.
l need a full rundown--

33:00.298 --> 33:02.425
Donald, did you sleep with her?

33:03.801 --> 33:04.969
Mother, please.

33:05.178 --> 33:08.431
Honestly, it's about time
l had some grandchildren.

33:08.598 --> 33:11.684
He isn't getting any younger.
You need to move fast.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.439
How exactly does Gibbs
expect us to delay him?

33:16.606 --> 33:18.232
l have a plan. Buckle your seatbelt.

33:18.399 --> 33:20.026
- What?
- Buckle.

33:23.571 --> 33:26.199
Come on, look out.
Look out. Look out.

33:55.103 --> 33:57.814
Boss, this was recorded
five minutes ago.

33:59.148 --> 34:01.275
Looks like Roca managed
to avoid Tony and Ziva.

34:01.442 --> 34:02.610
You think, McGee?

34:02.819 --> 34:04.654
His plane is scheduled
to depart within an hour.

34:05.113 --> 34:07.281
l guess we can't win them all.
l mean, he--

34:07.490 --> 34:08.824
The plane hasn't left. Delay it.

34:09.449 --> 34:11.452
- How exactly?
- Call the control tower.

34:11.661 --> 34:13.746
Tell them there's
a possible security risk.

34:13.955 --> 34:16.416
- Make something up.
- Can we do that?

34:16.666 --> 34:18.001
l don't know, McGee. Can you?

34:18.208 --> 34:20.837
Feed from the State Department
is coming in, sir.

34:21.170 --> 34:23.380
<i>What the hell were your people
thinking, Agent Gibbs?</i>

34:23.547 --> 34:25.507
<i>That was a diplomatic
vehicle they rammed.</i>

34:25.717 --> 34:28.469
You told us that we couldn't
question Roca.

34:28.636 --> 34:30.513
He wasn't in the vehicle
What's the problem?

34:30.679 --> 34:33.224
<i>- You don't understand the--
- Are you worried about insurance?</i>

34:33.474 --> 34:35.310
NClS has excellent coverage.

34:35.476 --> 34:37.728
<i>You're straining an already
tenuous situation.</i>

34:37.895 --> 34:40.356
We both know that Roca
is no diplomat.

34:40.523 --> 34:43.150
He's a foreign spy
operating on American soil.

34:43.318 --> 34:45.069
<i>- Then prove it.
- Give me permission</i>

34:45.235 --> 34:47.697
to take him into custody.
lf it helps, tell your people

34:47.864 --> 34:50.867
that he may have documents
vital to our national security.

34:55.371 --> 34:56.956
<i>All right.</i>

34:57.123 --> 34:59.250
<i>- l'll start the paperwork from this end.
- How long?</i>

34:59.417 --> 35:02.712
<i>lf l fast track the request,
maybe a week.</i>

35:02.879 --> 35:04.881
Okay, l talked to the control tower,

35:05.048 --> 35:07.175
convinced them to re-screen
all the passengers.

35:07.383 --> 35:09.385
Small airport, delay them
an hour or two at the most.

35:09.552 --> 35:12.513
Roca is on a private jet right now.
He's leaving the country.

35:12.722 --> 35:15.266
<i>The best l can do is lodge a formal
complaint with the embassy</i>

35:15.433 --> 35:16.768
<i>and bar him from returning.</i>

35:16.934 --> 35:20.355
He's not coming back, Levinson.
He is getting away with murder.

35:22.231 --> 35:26.152
Someone's trying to gain access into
MTAC with an unauthorized code, sir.

35:26.361 --> 35:27.528
Here.

35:34.577 --> 35:37.580
- Hello?
- This thing must be broken.

35:38.081 --> 35:40.083
l can't see anyone dancing in there.

35:40.249 --> 35:42.710
- Sir?
- We're okay. lt's clear.

35:44.003 --> 35:45.588
Should l get State back?

35:45.755 --> 35:47.590
For what?

35:48.424 --> 35:51.094
Mrs. Mallard,
are you looking for your son?

35:51.594 --> 35:53.513
Young man,

35:53.680 --> 35:55.431
have we met before?

35:55.598 --> 35:57.308
Leroy Jethro Gibbs, ma'am.

35:57.475 --> 35:59.268
Of the Southampton Gibbs'?

35:59.435 --> 36:01.896
Why don't we see if you can't find
Dr. Mallard, all right?

36:02.105 --> 36:05.274
You're very handsome, Matthew.

36:06.943 --> 36:10.279
Are you married?

36:15.243 --> 36:18.663
l'm so sorry, Dr. Mallard.
l just turned my back for a second.

36:18.871 --> 36:21.874
Not to worry, Jimmy.
l lose her all the time.

36:22.041 --> 36:24.335
l mean, she's really fast for her age.

36:24.502 --> 36:25.753
Yes, l'll call security.

36:25.962 --> 36:30.550
You may find it hard to believe,
but Donald was the cutest child.

36:30.758 --> 36:33.636
He had long, curly blond hair.

36:33.803 --> 36:36.597
Everybody thought he was a girl
until he was 1 2

36:36.764 --> 36:38.308
when his voice changed.

36:38.474 --> 36:41.561
Mr. Palmer, will you chain
my mother to the chair

36:41.769 --> 36:43.980
while l tell Agent Gibbs
what l found?

36:44.981 --> 36:48.151
l'm still waiting for that drink,
Leonard.

36:48.609 --> 36:52.113
l'm certain the shot to Lieutenant Hill's
head was perimortem

36:52.280 --> 36:55.158
based on the lack
of tissue reaction in her brain.

36:55.366 --> 36:57.827
- When shot she was unconscious.
- How'd she get that way?

36:59.162 --> 37:01.164
This is the lieutenant's head
and neck.

37:01.372 --> 37:05.668
The left superior carotid artery
is narrowed.

37:05.835 --> 37:07.962
- Restricted blood flow.
- Choke hold.

37:08.338 --> 37:11.966
Slight pressure for ten seconds
will render a victim unconscious

37:12.133 --> 37:14.010
and leaves no external bruising.

37:14.177 --> 37:18.514
l gave Abby some brain tissue
samples to check for CO2 levels.

37:18.681 --> 37:19.849
Any way to tie Roca to it?

37:20.058 --> 37:22.185
Well, he didn't leave any prints
on her skin.

37:22.352 --> 37:24.020
There's a chance
that some of the samples

37:24.228 --> 37:26.522
we took from her body
could have his DNA.

37:26.689 --> 37:29.067
But then, we don't have his DNA
for comparison.

37:29.233 --> 37:32.654
- And with diplomatic immunity?
- His plane leaves in two hours.

37:32.862 --> 37:37.241
- Find me something.
- Matthew, l'll be expecting your call.

37:37.659 --> 37:41.663
l can't remember my number,
but you'll get it from Donald.

37:50.046 --> 37:51.381
l tried everything.

37:51.547 --> 37:53.675
Yeah, it's encrypted,
and we change the codes every day.

37:53.925 --> 37:55.551
Can you extract a date?

37:55.718 --> 37:57.303
l could try.

37:57.512 --> 38:00.890
You know, Lieutenant Hill
could barely drive her own car.

38:01.057 --> 38:03.351
l find it hard to believe
that she could be the mole.

38:03.559 --> 38:05.520
That's probably why she was
so successful at it.

38:05.687 --> 38:06.854
Yeah.

38:07.063 --> 38:09.273
Not exactly the way
l wanted to end my Naval career.

38:09.440 --> 38:10.608
Asleep at the damn switch.

38:10.775 --> 38:13.319
- What was on that doodad thing?
- Can't tell yet, boss.

38:13.486 --> 38:15.530
l need one of my people
down here to decode it.

38:15.697 --> 38:17.824
- Are you still holding Lt. Napleton?
- Yep.

38:17.991 --> 38:20.535
Well, if you've cleared her,
l could sure use her help.

38:22.161 --> 38:23.413
What? Do you think
she's involved?

38:23.579 --> 38:27.208
We're investigating treason, skipper.
Right now, l suspect everyone.

38:27.375 --> 38:30.878
Well, if Hill wasn't the mole,
why'd she blow her brains out?

38:31.087 --> 38:33.631
She didn't. She had help.

38:34.298 --> 38:36.551
l found a fingerprint
on that flash-chip thing.

38:36.718 --> 38:38.136
Probably the person who did it.

38:38.594 --> 38:40.555
- Napleton?
- The protocol officer

38:40.722 --> 38:42.056
from the Venezuelan Embassy.

38:43.599 --> 38:46.602
Before you ask: No, l haven't found
any physical evidence linking

38:46.769 --> 38:48.730
Simon Roca
to the lieutenant's murder yet.

38:49.105 --> 38:51.899
That can wait, Abs. l need you to do
something else for me.

38:52.066 --> 38:53.443
lt'll only take a few minutes.

38:53.609 --> 38:57.280
Might go faster
if l have another one of these.

38:59.115 --> 39:02.285
Too much caffeine
is not good for you, Abby.

39:05.330 --> 39:07.790
l need you to check
this cereal box for GSR.

39:07.957 --> 39:09.792
- Why?
- Because l don't think

39:09.959 --> 39:12.879
Lieutenant Hill put the chip in there.

39:14.464 --> 39:16.591
l'm begging you, please.

39:16.799 --> 39:18.926
No. No way.

39:19.135 --> 39:22.972
l don't care how nice you are,
how much you bribe me,

39:23.139 --> 39:26.434
or how much you threaten me.

39:28.478 --> 39:30.438
l'm not filling out the paperwork.

39:30.605 --> 39:34.192
lt's not the filing
of the accident report l object to.

39:34.359 --> 39:36.736
l'd prefer if you said
you were driving the car.

39:36.903 --> 39:39.864
Well, that would be lying,
and lying is bad.

39:40.031 --> 39:42.575
Will you just listen to me?

39:43.826 --> 39:45.662
l'm listening.

39:46.621 --> 39:48.331
You're right.

39:49.248 --> 39:51.000
l'm sorry.

39:55.838 --> 39:57.674
l've been at NClS
for a short while.

39:57.840 --> 40:01.928
And it would look very bad to have
another accident in my dossier.

40:02.095 --> 40:06.432
- Another accident?
- l've had some difficulties.

40:06.641 --> 40:08.351
''Some'' indicates more than one.

40:08.518 --> 40:11.270
- How many?
- ls that really important?

40:14.315 --> 40:15.483
Three.

40:15.692 --> 40:17.318
But the second was not my fault.

40:19.696 --> 40:21.531
Now, are you going to help me?
Yes or no?

40:21.698 --> 40:23.700
Oh, that depends.

40:24.075 --> 40:25.159
What's in it for me?

40:37.338 --> 40:40.008
Anything you want.

40:41.843 --> 40:43.928
- Anything?
- Hey. Button your shirt.

40:44.095 --> 40:46.389
- Hey, boss, she came into my space--
- l don't care.

40:47.724 --> 40:51.644
- Roca's at the damn airport.
- Yeah. That's my fault, boss.

40:51.853 --> 40:53.354
l take full responsibility.

40:53.813 --> 40:55.648
l shouldn't have let Ziva drive.

40:56.232 --> 40:57.567
- lt doesn't fit.
- l know.

40:57.734 --> 41:01.904
l talked to my tailor about that. He says
the whole point of bespoke tailoring is--

41:02.071 --> 41:05.450
- But you mean Simon Roca.
- He's got diplomatic immunity.

41:05.616 --> 41:07.869
He knows we can't stop him
from leaving this country.

41:08.077 --> 41:09.537
So why the shell game with his car?

41:09.746 --> 41:12.415
ln fact, how did he even know
we were on to him?

41:12.957 --> 41:14.917
Yeah, Gibbs.

41:15.585 --> 41:17.712
On my way.

41:19.589 --> 41:21.591
- What was that for?
- Blackmailing your partner.

41:21.758 --> 41:24.552
Boss, the flash card data,
it's too corrupted to read.

41:24.761 --> 41:26.638
l'm gonna take a copy back
and have my people--

41:26.804 --> 41:28.056
lt's too late.

41:28.264 --> 41:30.266
Our person of interest
just got clearance for takeoff.

41:30.433 --> 41:34.270
You wanna see the guy who killed
your lieutenant get away? Come on.

41:34.437 --> 41:36.731
Gibbs, come here.

41:37.732 --> 41:39.442
You were right.

41:41.611 --> 41:45.073
DiNozzo, David, McGee.
Waiting for an invitation?

41:52.121 --> 41:53.831
What, just like that?
He gets a free pass?

41:53.998 --> 41:56.542
When a foreign diplomat
is accused of espionage,

41:56.751 --> 41:58.294
all we can do
is ask him to leave.

41:58.461 --> 41:59.962
Roca's doing it on his own.

42:00.129 --> 42:02.840
But if he could walk at any time,
why did he murder my lieutenant?

42:03.007 --> 42:05.551
Without her testimony,
hard to prove a case against him.

42:05.802 --> 42:08.096
So that's it,
there's nothing we can do?

42:08.304 --> 42:11.140
No, l didn't say that, skip.

42:11.307 --> 42:12.850
We can still arrest her murderer.

42:14.477 --> 42:19.440
Outside of my team, only two people
know how Lieutenant Hill died.

42:19.649 --> 42:23.319
Napleton and the person
who killed her.

42:24.612 --> 42:27.281
How'd you know she shot herself?

42:31.536 --> 42:33.037
Napleton told me.

42:33.204 --> 42:36.332
No, she's been in isolation
since she found out.

42:36.499 --> 42:38.876
You were the one who told us
about the missing flash card.

42:40.044 --> 42:41.921
The only thing tying Roca
to the case.

42:42.547 --> 42:44.298
Convenient, yes?

42:44.465 --> 42:46.592
Holing up inside the embassy, huh?

42:47.176 --> 42:49.262
Booking private planes.

42:49.470 --> 42:51.806
You wanted us to focus on Roca.

42:51.973 --> 42:55.560
- No. But Lt. Hill stole that flash card.
- There's gunshot residue

42:55.727 --> 42:57.687
on the outside of the cereal box
we found it in.

42:58.187 --> 43:00.815
The flash card was put there
by the killer after he shot her.

43:01.024 --> 43:02.191
She was framed.

43:02.400 --> 43:05.403
No. Napleton could have--

43:05.570 --> 43:09.157
- Her alibi checked out, Dorn.
- l'm impressed.

43:09.365 --> 43:11.909
The diplomat takes the blame.
We get our mole.

43:12.577 --> 43:14.912
And your cover remains intact,
captain.

43:15.371 --> 43:16.831
l'll have to remember that one.

43:16.998 --> 43:20.835
<i>- You could just rent No Way Out.
- l'll take it from here.</i>

43:21.002 --> 43:25.173
You three go home.
Get some rest. Good job.

43:29.552 --> 43:32.555
That resignation you offered
the admiral earlier.

43:34.557 --> 43:37.393
l got a feeling he's gonna accept it.
