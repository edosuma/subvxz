Look, we used to be friends... I hate his
guts... I hated... his guts... his guts!

02:26.881 --> 02:29.449
I hated him. He ruined my life.
He did something terrible...

02:29.483 --> 02:31.552
I haven't talked to him in
twelve years. No, I don't care.

02:31.586 --> 02:33.755
Oh, I don't care at all,
that's incredible!

02:33.788 --> 02:36.223
Okay, but you have to.

I don't have to. I don't... If I don't
want to, I can just... here, take 'em.

02:38.860 --> 02:41.663
I'm a lawyer,
so you... you have to.

02:41.696 --> 02:44.197
Are you saying I legally
have to spread these ashes?

02:44.231 --> 02:46.734
Yeah, you legally have to spread the ashes.
With Harry. Your... your friend Harry.

02:46.768 --> 02:48.569
- Harry Davis?
- Yeah.

02:48.603 --> 02:51.873
No! No! I hate Harry
more than I hate Derek!

02:51.906 --> 02:53.541
I haven't talked to him
in twelve years, either!

02:53.574 --> 02:55.677
I'm not gonna
spread his ashes with Harry!

02:55.710 --> 02:57.545
Are you kidding me?

02:57.578 --> 02:59.847
- Well, I told you, you have to.

02:59.881 --> 03:01.381
It's real.

You sound like
you don't understand law!

07:21.876 --> 07:23.744

You don't know my name, man!

Well, four letters.
Same four letters.

And then, I know another guy. I know a dude
named Dave who's kind of a strong guy like you.

All right, all right,
all right, that's true.

Okay. Well... I mean...

Everybody in the building doesn't like
you, man. Everybody kinda hates you.

07:55.910 --> 07:57.578
Nobody in the building likes me?

07:57.611 --> 07:59.880
Yeah! Cause you kinda...
You do this bullshit, man.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.949
Oh, so you guys all meet up and just talk

Okay, and I don't have to go
if I don't want to!

08:07.188 --> 08:08.923
It's not my responsibility
to be your friend.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.925
- As a neighbor.
- Wow!

08:10.958 --> 08:12.827
I'm not being rude. I'm not being a jerk.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.229
I just don't know you that well.
That's fine. That's my right.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.932

Have your fun.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.936
- Oh, whoa, what does that mean?
- Whatever that may be?

08:21.969 --> 08:23.838
I just... It doesn't mean anything.
It's just: do your thing!

08:23.871 --> 08:26.240
Do your thing... Okay, well...
Okay, we do our thing, uh...

08:26.273 --> 08:28.175

Wow, of course! Of course.
Of course... of course you know his name.

That's what I'm sayin'!

08:37.351 --> 08:38.919
I don't know, sometimes
I'm good, sometimes I'm not.

08:38.953 --> 08:41.088
This is real...
this is real fucked up, man.

08:41.122 --> 08:43.257

08:43.290 --> 08:46.160

- Yeah! No, okay. I mean...

08:48.062 --> 08:51.699
Okay, I'll work on it.

Jesus Christ!

09:51.859 --> 09:53.260
Fuck!

09:53.294 --> 09:56.831
You are gonna
be a good lime one day.

10:25.826 --> 10:29.864
You have
been visited by the bug fairy.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.748
Harry, what are you doin'?

10:47.781 --> 10:50.684
what are you
doing... What is this? Luke!

10:50.718 --> 10:53.053
- Were you polishing those limes, dude?
- No! I'm not...

10:53.087 --> 10:55.122
I'm not polishing the limes,
I'm just...

10:55.156 --> 10:56.991
- I'm just cleaning them, there's bugs...
- Oh, you're cleaning 'em.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.792
It's the first thing that people
see when they come to my house!

10:58.826 --> 11:01.095
I don't want bugs on my limes,
and...

11:01.128 --> 11:03.364
Oh, sure, because if they see dirty limes
they might turn around and not come in.

11:03.397 --> 11:07.902
What are you doing here? Is this,
like, some kind of... amends thing?

11:07.935 --> 11:10.371
Oh, an amends thing, sure, cause
I must be an alcoholic, right?

11:10.404 --> 11:12.740
I'm doing the twelve steps,
is that what it is?

11:12.773 --> 11:14.875
And wait a minute, what the hell
do I even have to make amends for?

11:14.909 --> 11:17.211
I mean, you slashed my tires.
That was kinda fucked up. Ya know?

11:17.244 --> 11:19.146
- So?
- I missed a job interview.

11:19.180 --> 11:21.916
- Oh, so what?
- Kinda changed my whole career path.

11:21.949 --> 11:24.718
Who cares, man? You got another
fuckin' job, it wasn't that big a deal.

11:24.752 --> 11:27.354
You ruined my chances with Lindsay, dude,
she was the girl of my fucking dreams.

11:27.388 --> 11:29.290
Oh, my God,
the girl of your dreams?

11:29.323 --> 11:31.392
You had like a million of those.
Who cares?

11:31.425 --> 11:33.961
That... No, I maybe had a few,
but she was the big, she was it, man.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.063
- The number one.
- She was number one!

11:36.096 --> 11:38.866
And you ruined my chances 'cause
she was fucking disgusted with me

11:38.899 --> 11:41.202
after I threw up
in front of the entire party,

11:41.235 --> 11:44.506
because for some reason, my two best friends
dared me to eat 50 eggs at the party!

11:44.539 --> 11:48.242
Yeah, for some reason. You ever heard
of a dare that you just don't do, Luke?

11:48.275 --> 11:50.477
- You ever just don't do the dare?
- No. Honestly, no!

11:50.512 --> 11:53.414
You know why we did it? 'Cause you
kept talking about "Cool Hand Luke",

11:53.447 --> 11:55.983
and he eats all the eggs
in the movie,

11:56.016 --> 11:58.085
- and you're like "I could do that, that's easy."
- I could do that. It is easy.

11:58.118 --> 12:01.222
- Yeah, well, that's why we dared you, stupid!
- No.

12:01.255 --> 12:03.357
Listen, and we all know why you
brought it up all the time.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.793
You kept saying, "Oh,
the cinematography in the movie's great."

12:05.826 --> 12:08.028
It is. It's shot really well.

12:08.062 --> 12:10.297
You brought it up because you wanted
us to call you "Cool Hand Luke."

12:10.331 --> 12:13.467
Oh, yeah, like that's such a...
such a sin! It's a cool nickname!

12:13.500 --> 12:15.537
- So what? I wanted a cool nickname!
- Yeah!

12:15.570 --> 12:17.972
I know it's a cool nickname.
That's why they named a movie after it.

12:18.005 --> 12:21.442
It's lame to wanna give yourself a
nickname, it's gotta happen organically.

12:21.475 --> 12:26.180
OK, yeah. Right. Sure. So that's so much worse
than you calling your car "The Honey Wagon!"

12:26.213 --> 12:28.249
No, that's way different,
that's a car!

12:28.282 --> 12:30.150
Cars can't name themselves,
I have to do it.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.319
- Cars don't need names!
- Everybody does it!

12:32.353 --> 12:34.822
So what? But "The Honey Wagon?"!
That's a stupid name!

12:34.855 --> 12:37.224
Luke, it's golden!
It's the color of golden honey!

12:37.258 --> 12:39.460
Okay. First of all; nobody
thinks of honey as a color.

12:39.493 --> 12:42.429
Second of all; golden is cooler!
Name it something gold!

12:42.463 --> 12:44.566
The gold... Car...
The gold... You know.

12:44.599 --> 12:46.200
- You're terrible at this. See! This is why...
- Goldmobile.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.570
Goldmobile!
Goldmobile is already better.

12:48.603 --> 12:50.838
Yeah, that's an awful nickname.
"The Honey Wagon" is great.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.007
Goldmember. Goldmember!

12:53.040 --> 12:54.975
- It had just come out!
- I don't hate that.

12:55.009 --> 12:56.810
- But it's still...
- Goldmember woulda worked.

12:56.844 --> 13:00.047
Yeah, okay. Well, listen,
I don't... miss this at all!

13:00.080 --> 13:03.083
So... what's up? What's the...
What the hell is this?

13:03.117 --> 13:05.352
This isn't why I came here.
I just...

13:07.054 --> 13:08.088
Derek's dead.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.959
Derek died.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.862
- An... Derek Anderson.
- Yeah.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.498
Oh. That's, uh...

13:20.067 --> 13:22.136
- So what?
- Yeah! "So what?"

13:22.169 --> 13:25.072
It's a little so what, right?
That's kinda how I reacted.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.408
Here's where
it gets interesting:

13:27.441 --> 13:31.145
He, specifically, left instructions for
you and me to spread his ashes together.

13:32.146 --> 13:34.214
No.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.116
No, I don't...
I don't wanna do that.

13:36.150 --> 13:37.951
I thought you might say that.
I didn't wanna do it either.

13:37.985 --> 13:41.088
But, look, man...
Here's what I'm thinkin'.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.490
Clearly, there's a lot of
animosity left between us.

13:43.525 --> 13:46.126
I think we could look
at this as a closure thing.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.228
I think there's a big
karma factor involved!

13:48.262 --> 13:51.031
Giving a dead man his last wishes,
we don't wanna fuck with that.

13:51.065 --> 13:53.133
- Come on...
- So, look, I think we just go do this,

13:53.167 --> 13:54.968
this place is only a
couple of hours away.

13:55.002 --> 13:58.005
Bang it out,
drop the ashes, no karma,

13:58.038 --> 14:00.174
we can say goodbye forever,
never have to speak to each other again.

14:00.207 --> 14:03.977
All right! All right, shut up.
Ya got me! Ya know I'm a karma guy.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.013
I do know you're a karma guy.
I thought that might work.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.549
All right,
give me like five minutes.

14:07.582 --> 14:09.183
I gotta go change out
of my play clothes, okay?

14:09.216 --> 14:11.018
- Your play clothes?
- Yeah! You know what?

14:11.051 --> 14:12.486
Listen...
give me six minutes.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.421
Oh, you need six minutes!
Sure, sure, sure.

14:14.455 --> 14:15.923
- Wait by The Honey Wagon, okay?
- Take your time.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.257
- You still have The Honey Wagon?
- Yeah.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.326
- That's pathetic!
- No, it's not.

14:35.142 --> 14:38.145
I know I can do it, man. Fifty eggs
in an hour? I could fuckin' do that.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.348
- No problem, dude.
- Who cares? I don't care.

14:41.382 --> 14:45.285
I know you don't care, dude, that's
what's the problem! It's pissin' me off!

14:46.353 --> 14:48.489
I don't see
why that's a problem at all.

14:48.523 --> 14:50.692
What?
It's a huge problem! Okay?

14:50.725 --> 14:53.460
It's a huge problem that you don't
care, 'cause it would be fuckin' cool.

14:53.494 --> 14:55.697
Don't you realize how cool it would
be if I actually pulled it off?

14:55.730 --> 14:58.332
If I ate fifty eggs in an hour?

14:58.365 --> 15:02.670
And that it's... it's shitty... that you...
that you don't care. 'Cause that would be cool.

15:02.704 --> 15:04.972
And what you're really saying is
that you don't think I can do it.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.674
And that's what really
fucking gets me heated!

15:06.708 --> 15:08.543
- No, I don't think you can do it.
- I know you don't!

15:08.576 --> 15:10.612
I saw you try!
You didn't do it.

15:10.645 --> 15:12.279
- Thank you for finally saying it, at least.
- Ya didn't do it!

15:12.312 --> 15:15.115
That time doesn't fucking count!
We've already...

15:15.149 --> 15:19.052
Man, fuckin' Joey Chestnut ate
a 141 eggs in eight minutes!

15:19.086 --> 15:21.689
Hundred forty-one in eight!
You think I can't do fifty in an hour?

15:21.723 --> 15:24.124
You're outta your mind if you think
that's true. Ya fuckin' lunatic.

15:24.158 --> 15:27.027
- Who the hell is Joey Chestnut?
- Who? You don't know who Joey Chestnut is?

15:27.060 --> 15:28.996
No.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.364
He's the most famous professional
eater in the world, dude!

15:30.397 --> 15:32.266
He's the king of the...
king of the sport!

15:32.299 --> 15:34.368
More famous than Kobayashi?

15:34.401 --> 15:37.171
Oh, don't gimme Kobayashi!
Kobayashi can suck a fat one, dude.

15:37.204 --> 15:39.273
That guy's a loser. He cheated!

15:39.306 --> 15:41.509
He's a hack, he cheated,
he got kicked outta the whole league, man.

15:41.543 --> 15:44.646
- He's not even allowed back.
- Well, this is news to me.

15:44.679 --> 15:46.614
Well, yeah, you don't even know
who Joey Chestnut is.

15:46.648 --> 15:49.450
You're not following
the professional eating news.

15:49.483 --> 15:51.485
I saw him on
a <i>SportsCenter</i> one time.

15:51.519 --> 15:53.387
- A <i>SportsCenter?</i>
- Yeah.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.590
That's not how you say it.
You saw it on <i>SportsCenter.</i>

15:55.623 --> 15:57.592
On... on... A...

15:57.625 --> 16:01.195
Did you see a <i>Everybody
Loves Raymond</i> the other day?

16:01.228 --> 16:03.163
Yeah, I saw an
<i>Everybody Loves Raymond.</i>

16:03.197 --> 16:04.231
Oh, God!

16:04.264 --> 16:06.433
I saw a <i>Seinfeld.</i>

16:15.577 --> 16:19.046
Dude, this place is fuckin' crazy!
You see all this?

16:19.079 --> 16:20.548
It's crazy. Look at this!

16:21.616 --> 16:23.651
Is that an ocean, or a lake?

16:23.685 --> 16:24.586
It's a lake.

16:26.621 --> 16:29.122
It's a huge fuckin' lake,
man, shit.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.357
- You can see the other side!
- Oh, fuck!

16:32.827 --> 16:36.430
Someone left a Frisbee!
Who just forgets a Frisbee, dude?

16:36.463 --> 16:38.198
It seems not uncommon.

16:38.232 --> 16:40.400
Oh my, God, it's got
this little surfer guy on it.

16:40.434 --> 16:43.170
"Malibu 110g" model,
yeah, that's the good one.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.405
- Yeah.
- The 1... the 120...

16:45.439 --> 16:48.342
I didn't... I wasn't crazy
about. But the 110...

16:48.375 --> 16:50.778
Does it sound like I know what I'm talkin' about?

16:52.680 --> 16:54.448
All right! Well, here ya go!

16:57.284 --> 16:58.285
What're ya doin?

16:59.787 --> 17:02.422
You're gonna let the Frisbee hit
your car instead of just catching it?

17:02.456 --> 17:04.692
I just didn't wanna play
Frisbee.

17:04.726 --> 17:07.160
What? Come on! Just throw a Frisbee.
you don't know how to throw a Frisbee?

17:07.194 --> 17:08.830
I don't feel like it!

17:08.863 --> 17:10.397
Can you not throw a Frisbee?
Is that what this is?

17:10.430 --> 17:12.399
I can throw a Frisbee! What...

17:12.432 --> 17:15.570
What is this, some kinda macho head game?
What is this?

17:15.603 --> 17:17.805
I mean, clearly you can't!
You're telling me you don't want to.

17:17.839 --> 17:20.775
Like... it's easy, man! I'm gonna have
to see it to believe it at this point.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.680
- Whaddya got, big boy?
- Check this out.

17:25.713 --> 17:27.381
- Check what out?
- Did you see it?

17:27.414 --> 17:29.449
What do you
think you just showed me?

17:29.483 --> 17:31.819
- What do you think you're doing?
- Harlem... Harlem Globetrotters.

17:31.853 --> 17:34.522
That... first of all,
they're basketball.

17:34.556 --> 17:37.792
No. Behind the ba... Okay, fair
enough, that's a little Harlem Globetrotter.

17:37.825 --> 17:39.493
- Can you throw it?
- Here, watch this.

17:40.828 --> 17:42.697
- That's a throw!
- Yeah.

17:42.730 --> 17:45.132
Look who can throw a Frisbee.
Impressive. You ready for this?

17:45.165 --> 17:46.801
That was amateur hour.

17:46.834 --> 17:48.435
- This is what gets you to the Olympic Games, okay?
- Okay.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.604
Here we go.

17:50.505 --> 17:53.106
- Agh, fuck!
- Oh, shit!

17:53.140 --> 17:55.777
- God! Luke! What the hell'd you do that for, man?
- Oh, my God. Are you all right?

17:55.810 --> 17:58.178
- I was just trying to do a cool throw, chill out!
- That sucked!

17:58.211 --> 18:00.882
No, it was a cool throw.
Are you okay, what happened?

18:00.915 --> 18:02.517
- Did it get you in the head?
- I don't know, take a look.

18:02.550 --> 18:05.753
Oh! No, that's fine.
That's actually fine.

18:05.787 --> 18:07.387
- Come on!
- There's nothin' there, so...

18:07.421 --> 18:09.122
Why would you do that face
and the thing?

18:09.156 --> 18:11.425
It's just a little red.
So that kinda surprised me.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.661
Everything's fine overall.
Can I see it one more time?

18:13.695 --> 18:15.697
- Oh! No!
- Cuh... what is it?

18:15.730 --> 18:17.599
- You did the...
- Um, nah. It's fine.

18:17.632 --> 18:19.901
You can't make a face like that.
Is it okay or what?

18:19.934 --> 18:22.269
It's... Yeah, it's just, it's...
We probably need a Band-Aid at this point.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.404
- Come on! What is this?
- Yeah. Okay.

18:24.438 --> 18:26.340
Well, look, everything's fine.
We just gotta go to the hospital, okay?

18:26.373 --> 18:28.543
- Just gimme your keys.
- Yeah, no! - Gimme your keys!

18:28.576 --> 18:30.645
- We gotta go to the hospital, gimme your keys.
- No! No, I'm drivin'.

18:30.678 --> 18:33.213
- I'm drivin'.
- Come on! Don't be ridiculous, just let me drive!

18:33.246 --> 18:35.583
- I drive The Honey Wagon! I drive The Honey Wagon! Luke!
- Just let me drive it.

18:35.617 --> 18:37.885
You can't drive in this condition. Do you
really think you should be driving right now?

18:44.626 --> 18:47.361
Seriously? You think this is safer?
You driving in this condition is safer?

18:47.394 --> 18:49.496
Yes, this is safer!
You're a terrible driver.

18:49.530 --> 18:52.165
Oh, I'm not a terrible driver,
I'm an amazing driver! You know it!

18:52.199 --> 18:55.235
No, you're not. You are a maniac.
You drive like a crazy person.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.672
- Nobody wants to be in a car with you.
- You don't know that!

18:57.705 --> 19:00.942
Don't say that like everybody tells you
they're scared to be in a car with me, man.

19:00.975 --> 19:02.644
People are in a car
with me all the time, dude.

19:02.677 --> 19:04.344
I don't wanna be in a car
with you!

19:04.378 --> 19:06.581
I don't care, man!
I'm an amazing driver, dude.

19:06.614 --> 19:08.783
Just because I drive
a little fast,

19:08.816 --> 19:10.818
or I make a crazy move here and
there, doesn't mean I'm a bad driver.

19:10.852 --> 19:13.253
The fact that
I've never got in an accident,

19:13.286 --> 19:15.422
or never gotten a ticket while doing
that, means that I'm an amazing driver!

19:15.455 --> 19:17.558
You're explaining
exactly why you're awful at it.

19:17.592 --> 19:19.761
You just haven't been
burned yet

19:19.794 --> 19:22.262
because, you know, you have some kind
of dumb luck following you around.

19:22.295 --> 19:25.232
- It's not luck!
- And I've got the Goddamn storm cloud following me around!

19:25.265 --> 19:27.401
Just 'cause I'm with you.
It's unbelievable!

19:27.434 --> 19:29.671
- It's not...
- It's always shitting on me, and you get off scot-free!

19:29.704 --> 19:32.305
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Get over it!
- That's it.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.509
I get hit in the head with a Frisbee. I'm
the one that's gotta go to the hospital.

19:34.542 --> 19:37.712
Get over it, it's no big deal,
it's one little cut on your forehead!

19:37.745 --> 19:40.815
It's not that fuckin'
big'a deal, man, you'll be fine!

19:40.848 --> 19:43.718
You'll look cool! You should be
thanking me while we're at it!

19:43.751 --> 19:45.586
What the hell
would I be thanking you for?

19:45.620 --> 19:47.421
You're gonna have a scar!

19:47.454 --> 19:49.624
You're gonna have a really cool
fuckin' scar on your forehead,

19:49.657 --> 19:52.359
you're gonna be able to tell people any
story you want about how you got it.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.762
Chicks love scars, man.
It's awesome.

19:54.796 --> 19:56.998
This scar right
here under my eyebrow?

19:57.031 --> 19:59.934
I got it 'cause I headbutted a guy
twice my size in a bar fight, dude.

19:59.967 --> 20:01.936
- Whoom! One shot! Down!
- I don't give a shit!

20:01.969 --> 20:03.971
You know that is not me?
You ever think about that?

20:04.005 --> 20:05.673
- Maybe it's not me to get in a bar fight.
- But it could be!

20:05.707 --> 20:07.441
- You could also enjoy it.
- Maybe I don't do that!

20:07.474 --> 20:09.409
Maybe Harry doesn't
get in fuckin' bar fights!

20:09.443 --> 20:12.379
Maybe I don't want that!
Maybe I don't wanna be a badass!

20:12.412 --> 20:14.515
Okay, well...

20:14.549 --> 20:17.852
Fuckin' shit, dude.
Too bad, you are one, look at you!

20:17.885 --> 20:21.923
You kiddin' me? Jesus Christ, this is the
most badass thing I've ever seen you do.

20:21.956 --> 20:25.358
You're bleedin' all over the place,
still drivin' your car. Screamin' at me.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.360
Not givin' me
an inch in this argument.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.764
Holdin' your own. Fuck, man.

20:29.797 --> 20:34.669
I've never seen you be more of a bad
ass, so... tough luck, you are one.

20:39.774 --> 20:43.376
- Whatever.
- Ugh, whatever.

20:53.020 --> 20:56.791
Did you really, um...
headbutt a guy twice your size?

20:56.824 --> 20:58.325
Oh, the scar?

20:59.426 --> 21:03.798
Um, no. I slipped on some
butter I had dropped.

21:03.831 --> 21:05.700
And I hit my head
on my rollerblades.

21:07.502 --> 21:09.804
I had rollerblades.
I was trying to get into 'em.

21:09.837 --> 21:11.973
I still think
they're actually cool. Um...

21:12.006 --> 21:13.875
Yeah, no,
stick with the headbutt story.

21:13.908 --> 21:15.910
- Yeah? You like that one better?
- Yeah, I think, uh...

21:15.943 --> 21:18.345
- Headbutt a guy twice my size.
- Yeah. - That's why I tell it.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.948
It sounds rad. I'm embarrassed of
the rollerblades but I shouldn't be.

21:20.982 --> 21:22.583
- 'Cause they're... Rollerblades are cool.
- Yeah. You should...

21:22.617 --> 21:24.018
- No.
- I think they're cool.

21:24.051 --> 21:28.355
Mmm... All right;
who cool wears them?

21:28.388 --> 21:31.092
I bet Prince did rollerblades.
Rest in peace.

21:31.125 --> 21:33.493
- He might have.
- I bet he was a rollerblade guy.

21:33.528 --> 21:36.564
- That's weird.
- How cool would he look? All that purple.

21:36.597 --> 21:39.667
- Flyin' down the sidewalk.
- Well, that's not fair. I feel like he can pull off anything.

21:39.700 --> 21:43.871
That's a guy! That can pull it
off. I'm a guy. Who knows?

21:43.905 --> 21:45.106
What's your favorite
Prince song?

21:45.139 --> 21:46.574
I don't really listen to Prince.

21:48.776 --> 21:50.343
What were his songs again?

21:50.377 --> 21:52.479
"Let's Go Crazy"?
That's fun.

21:52.513 --> 21:53.815
It was "Purple Train."
And then there's, uh...

21:53.848 --> 21:55.616
Shut up, asshole.

21:56.851 --> 21:59.486
- Yeah.
- All right. You ready for this?

21:59.520 --> 22:01.556
I'm gonna blow your
mind right now. You listenin'?

22:02.590 --> 22:04.692
I'm sorry
for slashin' your tires.

22:04.725 --> 22:07.094
It was an overreaction.
I shouldn't have done it.

22:07.128 --> 22:08.029
I apologize.

22:10.097 --> 22:12.066
Well... All right, I mean...

22:12.099 --> 22:15.736
- Boom, dude! Apology. In your face, apology.
- What the fuck?

22:15.770 --> 22:17.738
I'm the biggest man there is.

22:17.772 --> 22:19.874
- You... No! No! No! No!
- Nobody apologizes like I apologize.

22:19.907 --> 22:21.809
- Nobody apologizes like I apologize.
- The apology is now negated.

22:21.843 --> 22:23.678
- It's over. It doesn't even count anymore.
- No, no!

22:23.711 --> 22:25.012
It counts 'cause I said it!

22:25.046 --> 22:26.714
You did the whole thing after!

22:26.747 --> 22:28.716
It doesn't matter
what I did after, I apologized!

22:28.749 --> 22:30.618
You can't apologize and
then, like, spike the ball

22:30.651 --> 22:32.920
and do an end zone dance
after your apology.

22:32.954 --> 22:35.556
I can spike whatever the hell I want
after a bomb-ass apology like that, dude.

22:35.590 --> 22:38.125
- Spike this dick!
- How sincere did that sound?

22:38.159 --> 22:40.795
- At first, very.
- Yeah! That's 'cause it's real.

22:40.828 --> 22:42.697
I hon... I honest to God
thought it was real.

22:42.730 --> 22:44.765
So when you deliver a fuckin'
hot, sincere apology like that,

22:44.799 --> 22:46.167
you can spike whatever the hell
you want.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.135
- Well, it doesn't count. Now.
- Yes, it does.

22:48.169 --> 22:50.738
It was so...
I thought it was so nice.

22:50.771 --> 22:52.940
- Yeah. - And then it's gone. Just...
- And then I risked it.

22:52.974 --> 22:55.877
- Eh! Well, I said it regardless.
- Yeah.

22:57.144 --> 22:59.747
- This is a good-ass banana, dude.
- They're fine.

22:59.780 --> 23:01.414
Oh, I've had better.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.416
I'm not gonna shit for a week.

23:03.450 --> 23:05.119
You know these
things plug you up.

23:05.152 --> 23:07.054
- What?
- You know that?

23:07.088 --> 23:09.123
- They make you constipated?
- Yeah.

23:34.481 --> 23:36.817
- Fuck is this?
- This is the worst beach I've ever seen in my life.

23:36.851 --> 23:39.754
This is disgusting.
There's trash everywhere!

23:39.787 --> 23:41.555
I saw four diapers
walking up here.

23:41.589 --> 23:44.959
That water's fuckin' green.
Goddamn, man.

23:46.060 --> 23:48.461
Well, what do we...
I don't know, do you, like...

23:48.495 --> 23:49.997
Do you have to put your hands in it
and you spread it around or something?

23:50.031 --> 23:51.899
No. No, don't do that.
Just, uh...

23:51.933 --> 23:54.068
- Just a dump? Yeah.
- Well, ya know, like a shake.

23:54.101 --> 23:55.736
- Or scatter. Don't dump, ya know.
- Oh, you shake it out.

23:55.770 --> 23:57.838
- You see this by the way?
- Yeah.

23:57.872 --> 24:00.574
It's his damn picture on top of
a fuckin' piece of Tupperware!

24:00.608 --> 24:02.176
It's unbelievable.

24:02.209 --> 24:04.679
Yeah, you can dump that.
Yeah, do whatever you gotta do.

24:04.712 --> 24:07.581
Wait! You know what?
Hold that...

24:10.251 --> 24:12.553
- Yep!
- I'm gonna knock it outta the park.

24:12.586 --> 24:14.655
- All right!
- I'm gonna hit a fuckin' homerun with Derek's ashes.

24:14.689 --> 24:16.489
- How about that?
- Let's do it!

24:16.524 --> 24:17.558
So long, stupid.

25:42.810 --> 25:46.781
That felt fuckin' good,
dude, shit! Whoo!

25:46.814 --> 25:49.216
- Yeah, you really smashed it, man.
- Dude! Just dead center.

25:49.250 --> 25:51.185
- Four fifty.
- Ashes everywhere.

25:51.218 --> 25:53.087
Goodbye, Derek!

25:55.322 --> 25:57.925
Goodbye, Derek. Right?

25:57.958 --> 26:00.027
- Yeah.
- Huh.

26:02.063 --> 26:05.800
- Well. You wanna, uh...
- Yeah, we can probably just take off at this point, huh?

26:05.833 --> 26:07.935
- Let's beat it.
- Did what we gotta do. All right, let's do it.

26:07.968 --> 26:09.136
All right.

26:09.170 --> 26:10.971
- Uh!
- Hello, boys!

26:11.005 --> 26:13.174
- Derek!
- Yeah!

26:13.207 --> 26:16.043
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- I'm, uh... I'm alive.

26:16.077 --> 26:17.678
Why? That's the problem!
Why are you alive?

26:17.711 --> 26:19.613
I faked my own death!

26:19.647 --> 26:21.315
- I figured that much out!
- Home run, baby! Home run, man!

26:21.348 --> 26:23.350
Oh, yeah, you're happy
I hit a home run.

26:23.384 --> 26:24.985
What the fuck was that, by the way?
I hit a big ole thing'a ashes!

26:25.019 --> 26:27.054
It was my grandma's ashes.

26:27.088 --> 26:28.789
Yeah, whatever,
who cares. It doesn't matter.

26:28.823 --> 26:30.858
I just hit a home run with your
grandma's ashes?

26:30.891 --> 26:33.194
Yeah! She was a good woman,
and now you knocked her outta the park.

26:33.227 --> 26:34.995
- It was great.
- She was a great fucking woman. We met her, dude!

26:35.029 --> 26:36.664
- Yeah!
- You're gonna make me...

26:36.697 --> 26:38.399
You said goodbye to her.

26:38.432 --> 26:40.968
I said goodbye to you 'cause I
thought you were fuckin' dead!

26:41.001 --> 26:43.137
- Well, I'm alive. Clearly.
- This is fucking bullshit. I can't believe this, man!

26:43.170 --> 26:45.272
What the fuck are you doing?
Why is this happening?

26:45.306 --> 26:49.944
I... look, I faked my own death because
I need... eight hundred dollars.

26:49.977 --> 26:51.879
- Come on! No!
- Okay?

26:51.912 --> 26:53.914
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No! - Eight hundred dollars?

26:53.948 --> 26:55.216
- Yeah, just eight hundred dollars.
- Yes, exactly just...

26:55.249 --> 26:57.184
- It's not a lot!
- It's not a lot!!

26:57.218 --> 26:59.787
- That's a problem.
- It's not a lot! Yeah! Give it to me!

26:59.820 --> 27:02.156
It's a problem that you had to fake your
own death for only eight hundred dollars!

27:02.189 --> 27:04.425
- Well...
- You see?

27:04.458 --> 27:06.861
- It's not a lotta money.
- I see where... I see where you're coming from.

27:06.894 --> 27:08.829
- I get that.
- Oh, thank you! For understanding!

27:08.863 --> 27:11.265
- I just thought you guys could help me out!
- We won't.

27:11.298 --> 27:13.734
- We don't want to.
- Come on, man.

27:13.767 --> 27:15.302
How the fuck do you... What's the...
Why do you owe eight hundred dollars?

27:15.336 --> 27:17.438
Why do you not have
eight hundred fucking dollars?

27:17.471 --> 27:19.073
When you guys hear why I need this
money, you're gonna laugh, okay?

27:19.106 --> 27:21.175
- I can't wait.
- You're gonna crack up.

27:21.208 --> 27:22.977
- I can't wait to hear this story.
- You're gonna laugh so hard!

27:23.010 --> 27:25.112
- Okay, so... here's what happened.
- Let's go!

27:25.146 --> 27:27.214
- Okay.
- So, I'm playin' basketball over at that elementary school

27:27.248 --> 27:29.717
- on Culver, right? You guys know I love to ball.
- Sure.

27:29.750 --> 27:31.785
The elementary school we know about.
'Cause we're familiar with this town.

27:31.819 --> 27:33.454
They got the short hoops, right?
So that I can dunk on them, ya know?

27:33.487 --> 27:35.856
- No.
- So... I'm over there, and I'm just ballin'.

27:35.890 --> 27:38.692
I'm practicin'. Ya know? I'm just like...
doin' what comes natural to me.

27:38.726 --> 27:39.994
Which is
being bad at basketball.

27:40.027 --> 27:41.896
It's being good at basketball.
So...

27:41.929 --> 27:44.031
You've never been good
at basketball in your life.

27:44.064 --> 27:45.132
I always beat you, you never beat
me, you didn't even beat Harry!

27:45.166 --> 27:47.234
It's being good at basketball.

27:47.268 --> 27:49.136
You couldn't even beat Harry at
basketball and he's five foot six!

27:49.170 --> 27:51.105
- It's actually being good at basketball. So I'm...
- Seven.

27:51.138 --> 27:53.407
- He's five foot seven!
- I'm... It's... Good at basketball.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.476
So, uh... this woman I know, Linda, comes
over, and she starts makin' fun of me.

27:55.510 --> 27:57.411
She starts just raggin' on me!
Hard!

27:57.444 --> 27:59.180
- Hard raggin' on me, right?
- Good for her. Makes sense,

27:59.213 --> 28:00.948
'cause you were
probably doing badly.

28:00.981 --> 28:03.150
No. It's... I'm good.
So, she's makin' fun of me,

28:03.184 --> 28:06.253
and she says,
"If you can dunk the basketball,

28:06.287 --> 28:08.122
I will give you
a hundred dollars."

28:08.155 --> 28:09.990
- And...
- Right?

28:10.024 --> 28:11.892
I hate where this is about to
go, where this has to go,

28:11.926 --> 28:13.427
because there is no way you
can fucking dunk a basketball!

28:13.460 --> 28:15.162
Well, just wait for it.

28:15.196 --> 28:16.330
- Oh, there's more!
- So, I say... I say you're on.

28:16.363 --> 28:18.766
Easy money. E. Z. Money.
Right?

28:18.799 --> 28:22.036
So, I get the ball,
and I'm runnin'... I trip...

28:22.069 --> 28:23.971
- Yeah. - I trip.
- But wait a minute!

28:24.004 --> 28:26.440
I fuck up. I say, "Ehh,
double or nothin." Right?

28:26.473 --> 28:28.309
- That's what I wanted. It's a double or nothin' situation.
- Double or nothin', right?

28:28.342 --> 28:30.911
Two hundred bucks this time.
We're talkin' two hundred bucks.

28:30.945 --> 28:33.314
Rethink my strategy; I'm like, okay, I
need to get a better running start, right?

28:33.347 --> 28:35.349
So, I go back
like a couple blocks.

28:35.382 --> 28:36.750
- I start runnin' from there!
- Two blocks? - Like, two blocks.

28:36.784 --> 28:38.285
Yeah, like... like, two blocks.

28:38.319 --> 28:40.454
Why would you need to run
from two blocks away?

28:40.487 --> 28:43.123
- You're faster when you get to the hoop!
- All you need is momentum!

28:43.157 --> 28:45.192
Faster when you get to the hoop. So then I get
to the hoop, and I'm... I'm exhausted, man.

28:45.226 --> 28:46.760
- Right. 'Cause you ran for two blocks!
- I'm tired.

28:46.794 --> 28:48.262
Like more tired
than I've been in a while.

28:48.295 --> 28:50.197
And I...- I say, look,
double or nothing again.

28:50.231 --> 28:52.766
- I don't even wanna try this time.
- Don't... Come on!

28:52.800 --> 28:55.336
So... it's four hundred dollars now, I'm
thinkin'; I'll go back a couple more blocks.

28:55.369 --> 28:57.071
- No, not farther!
- A little further.

28:57.104 --> 28:58.973
That was the problem
the first time!

28:59.006 --> 29:01.408
- I know... I realize that now.
- Ya gotta go closer!

29:01.442 --> 29:03.143
Because... because I... I get there this time,
and I'm like... I'm like on the ground.

29:03.177 --> 29:06.146
I'm like sweating...
I'm exhausted.

29:06.180 --> 29:08.916
I'm tired, man. I'm tired!
So then I say, "double or nothin' again."

29:08.949 --> 29:11.085
- I wonder what happens next? Yeah.
- This is eight hundred dollars.

29:11.118 --> 29:13.821
- Eight hundred dollars is on the line.
- How's this dunk, go?

29:13.854 --> 29:15.990
You guys aren't gonna believe this; I...
I... I fucked up again.

29:16.023 --> 29:17.825
- Unbelievable. You're right, I don't believe it!
- Fucked up again.

29:17.858 --> 29:19.860
I owe her eight hundred dollars.

29:19.893 --> 29:23.364
And I need you guys to help me
out with it... please. Okay?

29:23.397 --> 29:27.334
I know this is kinda awkward, but I...
I'm in a... in a hard spot, here.

29:27.368 --> 29:29.336
"Awkward".
Is the word you would use.

29:29.370 --> 29:31.472
- Yeah, awkward.
- For what this fucking is.

29:31.506 --> 29:33.575
- It's a little awkward.
- Why the fuck do you think we would help you

29:33.608 --> 29:35.476
after what you fucking did
to us?

29:35.510 --> 29:39.013
- Oh, what in... what in college?
- Yes! The thing from college!

29:39.046 --> 29:41.849
Oh, you are... you're hung up
on that? Still?

29:41.882 --> 29:43.183
It was years ago!

29:43.217 --> 29:45.419
Who cares how long ago it was,
man!

29:45.452 --> 29:48.289
You planted drugs in our apartment,
called the cops on us, we got arrested,

29:48.322 --> 29:50.958
because we got arrested we got expelled.
You fucked up our whole lives!

29:50.991 --> 29:53.060
- Okay, well, in my def... in my defense...
- You fucked up my life. Really.

29:53.093 --> 29:55.496
- What?
- Mostly my life. Yours was not great.

29:55.530 --> 29:57.599
Oh, Jesus Christ, really?

29:57.632 --> 30:00.100
You wanna get in on me right now?
Can we focus on him please?

30:00.134 --> 30:02.336
- Okay. Al right, you're right.
- Hear me out.

30:02.369 --> 30:05.172
In my defense; the drugs
were in my apartment,

30:05.205 --> 30:07.441
'cause I lived with you guys,
so I went to jail, too. Okay?

30:07.474 --> 30:10.177
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's part of
what makes the thing fucking stupid.

30:10.210 --> 30:13.080
You guys had been doing shit to
each other... like the egg thing,

30:13.113 --> 30:15.449
and the slashing the tires,
and getting mad... so mad at each other,

30:15.482 --> 30:19.253
that I wanted to do something to
get you guys mad at me. Right?

30:19.286 --> 30:21.355
- How'd that turn out?
- Not good, obviously!

30:21.388 --> 30:23.525
- How'd it do for the group?
- Really not well.

30:23.558 --> 30:25.225
We haven't talked since,
have we?

30:25.259 --> 30:27.361
And it's all in the past.
That's what I'm saying.

30:27.394 --> 30:29.263
I thought that this would bring us
all together, and we could just...

30:29.296 --> 30:31.932
you know, like old times!
Have fun!

30:31.965 --> 30:33.601
- Help... help... help out old Derek!
- Old times giving you money!

30:33.635 --> 30:37.071
No. No. No, no, no! No!
I'm not doin' this! All right?

30:37.104 --> 30:39.940
I'm sick'a this shit! I'm out!
I'm out.

30:39.973 --> 30:41.975
I didn't wanna come here,
and I'm out.

30:42.009 --> 30:44.211
- Come on, Harry, no!
- Look what you did! Now we're leaving.

30:44.244 --> 30:47.047
Please! Please! Please! Wait, there's...
there's lives at stake here. Okay?

30:47.081 --> 30:49.249
What does that mean?
What did you do?

30:49.283 --> 30:54.321
If I don't get this money to Linda,
she is going to kill my best friend.

30:54.355 --> 30:57.659
- She just kidnapped someone?
- Yes! She... she kidnapped my best friend.

30:57.692 --> 31:01.028
And, if I don't get her the
money, she's gonna kill my Monkey.

31:01.061 --> 31:04.898
And I can't let that happen,
'cause Monkey is my whole life, okay?

31:04.932 --> 31:07.101
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Sorry. Sorry. Quick question...

31:07.134 --> 31:08.402
- What?
- Who is Monkey?

31:08.435 --> 31:10.938
Monkey's my...
Oh, Monkey's my dog.

31:10.971 --> 31:13.907
Okay, hey, man, how about you lead with
that part? I thought it was a person!

31:13.941 --> 31:15.510
Well,
I thought you guys knew that!

31:15.543 --> 31:17.010
"My best friend! They're gonna
kill my best friend!"

31:17.044 --> 31:18.379
You guys don't follow me
on Instagram.

31:18.412 --> 31:19.681
You guys gotta follow me
on Instagram, man.

31:19.714 --> 31:22.015
No we don't!
We hate you, remember?

31:22.049 --> 31:23.117
Well, allow me to introduce you to
a little dog named Monkey, okay?

31:23.150 --> 31:25.319
Don't. I don't wanna do this.

31:25.352 --> 31:26.153
When you see this dog, you are gonna
help me out. Lemme tell ya, okay?

31:26.186 --> 31:28.389
No. No.

31:28.422 --> 31:30.592
Here; this is my favorite picture of us.
That's us in the grass, okay?

31:30.625 --> 31:33.127
- Here we are in the grass.
- Great. Great. Dog in a grass. Congratulations.

31:33.160 --> 31:35.362
This one, uh, here's another one.
This is seconds later. We're in the grass.

31:35.396 --> 31:37.231
- Can you believe it?
- Monkey's eyes are closed there.

31:37.264 --> 31:39.466
- Unbelievable.
- Blinking, I'm pretty sure.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.503
- Wow. What a picture. I can't wait for this...
- And then here we are,

31:41.536 --> 31:43.971
just seconds later, in the grass
again, her eyes are open,

31:44.004 --> 31:45.673
she's done with the blink that she
was taking in the picture before that.

31:45.707 --> 31:47.174
- That's fascinating, man. We're not...
- Listen...

31:47.207 --> 31:49.209
- No. We don't... I don't care!
- Luke...

31:49.243 --> 31:50.077
- I don't care! I don't... that's not my dog!
- Luke, Luke, Luke!

31:50.110 --> 31:52.446
It's a real dog.

31:52.479 --> 31:56.584
If... his dog's gonna die, I can't live
with myself if that happens, all right?

31:56.618 --> 31:59.319
I can't live with myself...
I am a dog owner,

31:59.353 --> 32:02.256
I can't look at my dogs in the eye after
that; and it's just not happening, okay?

32:02.289 --> 32:06.260
- Your dogs. How many dogs do you have?
- I have six dogs.

32:06.293 --> 32:07.662
- It's a lot!
- You have six fucking dogs?

32:07.695 --> 32:09.631
- That's insane.
- That's a normal amount of dogs.

32:09.664 --> 32:12.132
- That's a lotta dogs.
- That's far from a normal amount of dogs.

32:12.166 --> 32:14.301
- I'd say every...
- This is the first time we've agreed on something, right?

32:14.334 --> 32:16.036
Well, don't get fucking excited,
I still hate your goddamn guts. All right?

32:16.069 --> 32:17.672
- That's a lotta dogs...
- Here's what we're gonna do.

32:17.705 --> 32:20.542
Listen very closely, we're
gonna do you this one favor,

32:20.575 --> 32:22.142
we are gonna
help you get your dog...

32:22.176 --> 32:23.343
- You're really gonna help me?
- Shut up!

32:24.244 --> 32:26.447
- One favor: help you get your dog.
- Yeah.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.982
Once you have
your dog back,

32:29.016 --> 32:32.720
we're gonna go right back to never fucking
talking to each other ever again. Okay

32:32.754 --> 32:34.622
- That's... I'll... I'll take that deal. That's fair.
- Oh, you'll take it.

32:34.656 --> 32:36.290
You'll take it? How about you?
Will you take the deal?

32:36.323 --> 32:37.759
- All right.
- Deal or no deal? - Deal.

32:37.792 --> 32:39.527
Deal it is. All right?

32:39.561 --> 32:42.029
Jesus Christ, this whole
thing is bullshit, by the way.

32:42.062 --> 32:45.466
I don't think this Linda fuckin' bi...
tch is gonna kill a dog just... because...

32:45.499 --> 32:47.602
- Luke! Don't say the b-word!
- She said she would, man.

32:47.635 --> 32:49.403
I didn't wanna say it!
I hesitated, all right?

32:49.436 --> 32:51.104
- That's why it's bad!
- I don't wanna take a chance.

32:51.138 --> 32:52.707
No! It was bad if
I just said it confidently!

32:52.740 --> 32:55.309
I don't believe this
Linda bitch is gonna do this.

32:55.342 --> 32:57.411
No, it's bad because you know better and
you still did it. That's disappointing.

32:57.444 --> 33:00.013
- What's wrong with you, man?
- Oh! Because I kne...

33:00.047 --> 33:02.584
because I had a problem saying it means I shouldn't
have said it because I knew it was wrong.

33:02.617 --> 33:04.686
- I'm with Derek on this one.
- Yeah, dude.

33:04.719 --> 33:07.655
No, that makes sense, that makes sense.
All right, let's go...

33:07.689 --> 33:09.356
- politely meet Linda.
- Okay.

33:09.389 --> 33:11.693
- I won't call her a bitch.
- See that you don't.

33:11.726 --> 33:14.596
And we'll say; "This is stupid, give me
this fucking dog," and then we'll leave.

33:14.629 --> 33:17.130
And we'll leave, I'll never see you again,
I'll never see you again. Sound good?

33:17.164 --> 33:19.433
- That...
- We already made a deal. I'm fucking... Let's go.

33:19.466 --> 33:21.335
- All right.
- Let's fucking get outta here.

33:21.368 --> 33:23.303
- It was good to see you.
- Don't... - This is crazy...

33:46.661 --> 33:49.664
Okay, so, look; these guys are...
they're kinda tough, okay?

33:49.697 --> 33:51.766
So let me just do the talking here.
We'll take care of it.

33:51.799 --> 33:54.501
Okay. We'll let you do the talking.
That should go fantastic.

33:54.536 --> 33:56.804
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey, Dweeb! - Hey.

33:56.838 --> 33:58.372
- Derek.
- Yeah.

33:58.405 --> 34:00.508
What's good, man?
Who are these guys?

34:00.542 --> 34:02.109
This is Luke, this is Harry.
These guys are my best friends, okay?

34:02.142 --> 34:04.411
No, no! We're not his best
friends. Okay?

34:04.444 --> 34:08.448
Don't... We... we... Look; I am Luke,
he is Harry, we're not his best friends.

34:08.482 --> 34:09.751
We're just here to help him
get his dog back. All right?

34:09.784 --> 34:11.485
- Huh!
- Yeah.

34:11.519 --> 34:12.754
Ya know that sounds like
somethin' a friend would do.

34:14.087 --> 34:17.090
Sure! Yeah. It does, doesn't it?
Uh, but that's not the case.

34:17.124 --> 34:19.594
We're not friends,
we haven't been for years.

34:19.627 --> 34:22.630
We are here just to help this one time, that's
all it is, doesn't really matter otherwise.

34:22.664 --> 34:26.734
Uh, so if we could just... move on
from this whole thing, Dweeb, was it?

34:26.768 --> 34:28.101
Is your name Dweeb?

34:28.135 --> 34:30.404
Yeah, it is!

34:30.437 --> 34:32.574
Is that a nickname, or... Where'd that...
Did your mom give you that name?

34:32.607 --> 34:35.142
I... I... I know what
you're doin'. All right?

34:35.175 --> 34:37.645
You think that, like, because they call
me Dweeb I'm dumb or something, but...

34:37.679 --> 34:39.581
- I didn't say...
- It's actually the opposite.

34:39.614 --> 34:41.348
- They call me Dweeb 'cause I'm smart.
- Okay!

34:41.381 --> 34:42.817
I can do all kinds of stuff that
other people can't do.

34:42.850 --> 34:45.152
Okay! And... what is that,
what can you do?

34:46.821 --> 34:50.257
Like, I could... I could take apart an iPhone
and put it back together in five minutes,

34:50.290 --> 34:51.291
easy, no big deal.

34:52.694 --> 34:55.195
- You just take it apart, put it back together?
- Yeah. Yeah.

34:55.228 --> 34:58.432
It... it's hard! Not a lotta
people can do it. So, there's that.

34:58.465 --> 35:01.335
It's not that hard.
I've... I've done it.

35:01.368 --> 35:03.270
- Okay, so that's...
- I mean, I've done it!

35:03.303 --> 35:05.472
- that's two out of four in the... in the space.
- Hi, Dweeb.

35:05.506 --> 35:08.141
- Yeah, you... Oh...
- Did it take you... How long...

35:08.175 --> 35:09.644
- Did it take you five minutes?
- Did you time it?

35:09.677 --> 35:11.646
No, I... I didn't...
I didn't time it. So...

35:11.679 --> 35:14.481
No, you didn't, 'cause you
couldn't do it in five minutes.

35:14.515 --> 35:18.318
I took it apart and put it
back together in five minutes.

35:18.352 --> 35:19.787
- Can we come in, man? I mean is that all right?
- Okay.

35:19.821 --> 35:21.556
Oh, yeah, yeah!
No, come, come, come on.

35:21.589 --> 35:23.390
- I just wanna talk to Linda.
- Oh! Okay, yeah, yeah.

35:23.423 --> 35:24.892
How do you open this thing?

35:24.926 --> 35:26.493
- Flip the horseshoe thing up...
- Flip it... up?

35:26.527 --> 35:28.395
Twist it back, it opens...
Push or pull.

35:28.428 --> 35:29.864
Either or,
I designed it that way.

35:29.897 --> 35:32.265
- Okay.
- Well, you're pushing that one up,

35:32.299 --> 35:34.434
- I'm pushing this one out.
- It doesn't matter, you can do either or.

35:34.468 --> 35:36.403
- It's custom. It's custom.
- It doesn't... I think it's fine, mate? It's okay.

35:36.436 --> 35:38.472
Do you wanna... Should we do
the same way with both? Or...

35:38.506 --> 35:39.807
- Just open 'em split like that...
- That doesn't make sense.

35:39.841 --> 35:41.341
And then all three of
yous come in.

35:41.375 --> 35:43.611
That's really weird, man.
All right!

35:44.979 --> 35:47.915
Come on.
No. Hey. Leave it!

35:47.949 --> 35:49.216
Don't... just leave it open.

35:49.249 --> 35:51.284
It's just for security, Dweeb!

35:51.318 --> 35:53.220
- Aren't you a security guard kinda thing?
- Yeah, but this isn't...

35:53.253 --> 35:55.188
I don't want
anything bad to happen.

35:55.222 --> 35:56.390
Oh, actually, it doesn't make sense.
Yeah, close it up!

35:56.423 --> 35:57.357
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:20.982 --> 36:24.351
- Nice place.
- Yeah. Yeah, it is.

36:25.285 --> 36:28.956
- Lotta animals.
- Yeah. I love 'em.

36:28.990 --> 36:30.958
You love animals?

36:30.992 --> 36:32.627
Yeah,
I have my whole life.

36:32.660 --> 36:34.595
Did you...
Uh, decorate this place?

36:34.629 --> 36:35.997
I did! I did, yeah.

36:36.030 --> 36:38.566
- You did a good job.
- It's good, man.

36:38.599 --> 36:40.568
Yeah,
I like this whole forest thing.

36:40.601 --> 36:42.970
Sure.
Kinda rainforest-y.

36:43.004 --> 36:45.773
Yeah, it's like wet...
it's like wet forest.

36:47.307 --> 36:51.478
Derek, Derek, Derek. My man!

36:51.512 --> 36:53.548
Hey, Linda.
Uh, how's it goin'?

36:53.581 --> 36:55.315
How's it going with me?

36:55.348 --> 36:56.951
Ugh! What a gentleman!

36:56.984 --> 36:59.787
Uh, It's going great with me.
How's it going with you?

36:59.821 --> 37:02.890
- I'm... I mean, overall, I'm okay.
- Yeah!

37:02.924 --> 37:04.959
- I... had some chips earlier...
- Uh-huh, do you have my money? - Mmm.

37:06.027 --> 37:08.596
Uh... not... No, not yet.

37:08.629 --> 37:10.665
- We were... That's why we came over to talk about that.
- Mmm.

37:10.698 --> 37:12.499
Right. I'll help you out here, buddy.
I'll take over.

37:12.533 --> 37:14.736
Hi, how are ya? Luke.
Nice to meet ya.

37:14.769 --> 37:16.037
I love everything you
got goin' here, by the way!

37:16.070 --> 37:17.972
I like the house,
I like the vibe.

37:18.005 --> 37:20.373
You got the big tough guy out front.
That's pretty cool.

37:20.407 --> 37:22.375
You're comin' in with a nice
powerful energy. That's pretty cool.

37:22.409 --> 37:24.277
- Mm-hmm!
- Here's the thing;

37:24.311 --> 37:26.614
I know he made a bet,
I know he owes you money.

37:26.647 --> 37:28.950
He will get you the money...

37:28.983 --> 37:32.352
but you can't just go around
kidnapping people's dogs. K?

37:32.385 --> 37:35.422
That's weird, and that's
messed up. It's rude.

37:35.455 --> 37:37.390
I can use all kinds
of words for what it is!

37:37.424 --> 37:39.359
- It's just not somethin' ya do.
- Mmm.

37:39.392 --> 37:42.362
So... I am thinkin';
he'll pay you back!

37:42.395 --> 37:44.766
- I'll stay on him; I'll make sure he pays you back!
- Yeah.

37:44.799 --> 37:47.635
But we're gonna take the dog right
now and we're gonna get outta here.

37:47.668 --> 37:49.604
- What do you think about that?
- Ahh.

37:49.637 --> 37:55.510
- Wow. I think that this is a... an amazing plan!
- Mmm!

37:55.543 --> 37:57.444
- All right!
- Okay!

37:57.477 --> 37:58.613
- This is an amazing plan!
- Amazing plan! Perfect!

37:58.646 --> 38:00.447
- Wow!
- So you like it!

38:00.480 --> 38:02.583
- It's beautifully crafted.
- Yes. There's craftsmanship.

38:02.617 --> 38:06.621
And yet, and yet! It's so...
Ooh, it's exciting!

38:06.654 --> 38:08.956
- Yes, it's very exciting.
- There's something, um...

38:08.990 --> 38:12.760
I have to ask. And, I mean, I think I
know the answer, but, is this a, um...

38:12.794 --> 38:15.062
Is this a group effort?
This... this plan.

38:15.096 --> 38:18.398
Was it sort of, he contributed, oh, he
threw in a thought, and then, oh, but then.

38:18.431 --> 38:20.601
- Ya know?
- You know what...

38:20.635 --> 38:23.037
Or... or, was there someone who
said, "Ya know what? I have an idea."

38:23.070 --> 38:25.405
Was there someone like that?

38:25.438 --> 38:28.075
I'll take credit for that right there.
That was me. No worries, guys.

38:28.109 --> 38:30.945
- It was my plan. I'm runnin' the show. How about that?
- Wow!

38:30.978 --> 38:33.346
You know what?
I had a feeling.

38:33.380 --> 38:35.415
- Yeah? - I did have a feeling.
- You could tell?

38:35.448 --> 38:37.384
- I could kinda tell about you.
- OK. I like that.

38:37.417 --> 38:39.587
Um, will you go get
the dog, by the way?

38:39.620 --> 38:41.856
- What do you got there?
- Yeah, I'm sorry, it's just a little house business.

38:41.889 --> 38:45.860
- Sure.
- But, I... I... I could kinda tell, when I first walked in...

38:45.893 --> 38:47.929
- you're the leader of the group, aren't you?
- Yeah, you picked up.

38:47.962 --> 38:50.064
- Ugh. Amazing...
- We're... we're... we're vibin' here.

38:50.097 --> 38:51.899
- We're pickin' up on each other's energy...
- We really...!

38:51.933 --> 38:53.534
- It's workin'! - It's crazy, huh?
- It's workin'.

38:53.568 --> 38:55.703
- So...!
- Yeah.

38:55.736 --> 38:58.005
I think we're good! We like what
we're talkin' about, we're vibin',

38:58.039 --> 39:00.141
- we're in a good space here...
- I love what we're talkin' about! Absolutely!

39:00.174 --> 39:02.076
- How about we take the dog and get outta here?
- The dog.

39:02.109 --> 39:05.146
- You mean this dog! This is perfect timing!
- Right.

39:05.179 --> 39:06.747
- Monkey!
- Oh, this dog.

39:06.781 --> 39:08.481
- Monkey, it's me, daddy!
- That's the dog.

39:08.516 --> 39:10.785
- It's me, daddy. Remember me?
- Oh, my God, my angel!

39:10.818 --> 39:13.855
- No, no, no. Don't hold her like that! She hates that!
- She's so cute!

39:13.888 --> 39:16.157
- Just take it easy. - Oh, she hates that!
- She's so beautiful.

39:16.190 --> 39:19.594
Do you ever look at nature and
think, "How did we get here?"

39:19.627 --> 39:23.030
- All the time!
- All the time? It's stunning!

39:23.064 --> 39:24.732
You're stunning!

39:24.765 --> 39:26.000
Okay, here we go,
here's a new thought for ya!

39:26.033 --> 39:27.969
I hope
you're gonna like this one.

39:28.002 --> 39:31.038
You don't get to do this, okay?
This is bullshit.

39:31.072 --> 39:34.474
You don't get to taunt him with
his own dog that you've kidnapped.

39:34.508 --> 39:37.011
And ya know what I don't buy any of this!
How about that?

39:37.044 --> 39:38.846
I think you guys are
puttin' on a little show here!

39:38.880 --> 39:41.148
A little show?

39:41.182 --> 39:43.551
I think you guys are playin' your little
characters. You got the bodyguard guy.

39:43.584 --> 39:45.586
You got the crime boss. Kingpin.
I think you're playin' a character here!

39:45.620 --> 39:47.555
- Crime boss!
- I think you're playin' a little character.

39:47.588 --> 39:49.422
- Kingpin!
- You saw a movie...

39:49.456 --> 39:51.458
- Little character!
- You saw somethin' cool...

39:51.491 --> 39:53.594
Little puttin' on the Ritz!

39:53.628 --> 39:55.663
Some guy threatened to kill
somebody 'cause they owed him money,

39:55.696 --> 39:57.098
- you're like, "I wanna be like that."
- Right. Right.

39:57.131 --> 40:00.001
- I'm gonna be a big tough guy.
- Big tough guy.

40:00.034 --> 40:02.069
- I think you're doin' an act, I think you're full'a shit.
- "A little act."

40:02.103 --> 40:03.671
I don't think
you're gonna do anything!

40:03.704 --> 40:05.106
You don't think
that I'm gonna do anything!

40:05.139 --> 40:07.141
I don't think
you're gonna do anything.

40:07.174 --> 40:08.976
- You don't think that I'm gonna do, ooh, anything, huh?
- Nothin'.

40:09.010 --> 40:11.012
- "Nothin'!"
- Nothing! Whaddya think?

40:11.045 --> 40:13.214
I think...

40:13.247 --> 40:14.849
Back to the whispering. What are you saying?

40:14.882 --> 40:16.951
- Oh! Yeah. Okay! Yeah!
- Right? Give him a kiss!

40:16.984 --> 40:19.486
- Aye! H!
- Hey, Dweeb.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.855
Can I see your hand? Just for
one second. Can I see your hand, please?

40:20.888 --> 40:22.723
- What for?
- Oh, I just gotta try somethin'.

40:22.757 --> 40:24.926
- All right. Oww!
- Oh, shit, man, what are you doin'?

40:24.959 --> 40:27.128
He snapped
my pinky finger!

40:27.161 --> 40:29.730
You snapped his pinky finger, man!
What the fuck! Why'd you do that?

40:29.764 --> 40:33.134
A quick question, you still think
that I'm gonna do nothing? Hmm?

40:33.167 --> 40:37.138
Yes! You just did nothing, you made
him do a thing! You didn't do shit!

40:37.171 --> 40:39.540
It's a real
collaborative effort!

40:39.573 --> 40:41.676
You're still full... No, I don't care.
It doesn't count. You didn't do shit!

40:41.709 --> 40:43.644
- It is! It's fifty-fifty! I'm holding the dog!
- Luke, who cares?

40:43.678 --> 40:44.912
- Luke, shut up!
- No, she didn't do it! It was just the guy!

40:44.946 --> 40:47.615
- Linda, we'll get the money!
- Yeah...

40:47.648 --> 40:49.050
- I don't even care about that. We'll get the money. It's fine.
- We'll get the money. It's fine.

40:49.083 --> 40:51.185
Okay, just calm down.
Just relax. Okay...

40:51.218 --> 40:53.254
- I don't wanna calm down!
- Easy, easy. Just wait. - Let me have this!

40:53.287 --> 40:55.089
You'll be fine. Just breathe.

40:55.122 --> 40:57.692
Oaky, look, yes.
We'll go, we'll get your money...

40:57.725 --> 40:59.760
- Mm-hmm... - We'll come back.
- Mm-hmm...

40:59.794 --> 41:01.796
K?

41:01.829 --> 41:05.566
How about this; you have 24 hours,
or else I kill your fucking dog.

41:05.599 --> 41:07.702
- Huh?
- Oh my God!

41:07.735 --> 41:10.071
- Let's just... let's get the money, okay?
- Fine! Twenty-four hours it is.

41:10.104 --> 41:12.106
- Come on, let's go. - Twenty-four hours...
- We're goin'. You're all right.

41:12.139 --> 41:14.575
- That's one day.
- We know what twenty-four hours is, man!

41:14.608 --> 41:19.246
Okay! Hello. Nice check in.
Always so sad to see the boys go.

41:19.280 --> 41:21.649
Always sad
to watch 'em walk away.

41:21.682 --> 41:25.920
But they look so good doin' it.

41:25.953 --> 41:28.089
God, man!
I don't buy this, dude.

41:28.122 --> 41:30.958
This Linda chick is full'a shit,
and I still think that!

41:30.992 --> 41:32.927
- I don't buy it!
- Luke, she's not full of shit! Look at my hand, man!

41:32.960 --> 41:35.629
I don't care! That's what I'm
saying; she didn't do that!

41:35.663 --> 41:38.866
She... she told the Dweeb guy to do it, who I
can't get a read on that guy at all, by the way.

41:38.899 --> 41:41.802
All right, that's just semantics.
Who gives a shit who did it?

41:41.836 --> 41:43.904
Someone broke my hand;
someone could kill a dog!

41:43.938 --> 41:47.675
And if they kill the dog, if they...
kill the dog... we lose.

41:47.708 --> 41:49.210
We don't want that to happen.

41:49.243 --> 41:51.912
No, Derek, we understand
what we're trying to accomplish.

41:51.946 --> 41:54.015
- Right, it's just a reminder.
- Thank you for the reminder. Thank you for staying on it.

41:54.048 --> 41:56.751
- I'm glad you're here for that.
- No problem! Anytime. You're welcome.

41:56.784 --> 41:59.754
Okay... so! Because Dweeb is capable of breaking
a finger, he's capable of killing a dog.

41:59.787 --> 42:04.158
That's fair logic. My bad.
So, eight hundred dollars...

42:04.191 --> 42:07.561
- Harry!
- What?

42:07.595 --> 42:09.697
Do you have
eight hundred dollars?

42:10.598 --> 42:13.000
- No! I mean, I...
- How much ya got?

42:13.034 --> 42:14.869
- I got...
- Do you have, like, a savings account, or...

42:14.902 --> 42:16.904
- Sure, of course, I do.
- What's in...

42:16.937 --> 42:19.140
- That's... absolutely I have a savings account.
- What's in it?

42:19.173 --> 42:20.074
- How much money do you have in the savings account?
- How much...

42:20.107 --> 42:21.242
in the savings account?

42:23.044 --> 42:25.012
- Three hundred dollars.
- Eesh.

42:25.046 --> 42:27.081
- That's so much money!
- No. No, no, no.

42:27.114 --> 42:29.283
- For a savings account? That's not...
- It's not?

42:29.316 --> 42:31.252
That's nothing. That's kind of
embarrassing, dude. Why even have it?

42:31.285 --> 42:33.788
It's not embarrassing. I have a house!
I have a lemon tree.

42:33.821 --> 42:35.856
It's kind of unnecessary to have a savings
account if it's only three hundred dollars.

42:35.890 --> 42:37.591
Three... three hundred's weird.

42:37.625 --> 42:40.294
Don't... don't shame me for
this! What do you have?

42:40.327 --> 42:41.796
What, total?

42:41.829 --> 42:43.831
Yeah, money,
total, money, dollar.

42:43.864 --> 42:46.200
How many money
dollars do you have?

42:46.233 --> 42:49.203
I... got like one fifty.

42:49.236 --> 42:51.272
- That's nothing!
- But I don't have a savings account.

42:51.305 --> 42:53.307
- That's less than him.
- That's half!

42:53.340 --> 42:55.609
- I don't have a savings account, though!
- That's less than he has.

42:55.643 --> 42:57.044
It's weird that you have that much
in a sav... If I had one fifty...

42:57.078 --> 42:58.145
So you have zero
in a savings account.

42:58.179 --> 43:00.047
And one fifty in the checking.

43:00.081 --> 43:02.283
- All right.
- That's four fifty. What do you have?

43:04.151 --> 43:06.887
- What are you...
- Uh, okay, so...

43:06.921 --> 43:08.189
- In your wallet...
- Right now...

43:08.222 --> 43:09.723
I have this.

43:09.757 --> 43:11.392
That's a five-dollar bill.

43:11.425 --> 43:13.260
Yeah, and I have it.

43:13.294 --> 43:14.728
Do you have a bank account?
Where's the rest of your money?

43:14.762 --> 43:16.330
No,
I don't have a bank account.

43:16.363 --> 43:18.365
Why would I have a ba... No.

43:18.399 --> 43:20.734
- Why don't you have a bank...
- I'm not fallin' for that.

43:20.768 --> 43:22.203
- I'm not fallin' for that one!
- Falling for what? Saving your money?

43:22.236 --> 43:23.838
- Putting your money somewhere?
- Not... Yeah!

43:23.871 --> 43:26.240
- What is there to fall for?
- No, thanks!

43:26.273 --> 43:29.910
'Cause you know, the moment they get all...
The moment you open that thing up...

43:29.944 --> 43:31.879
- They keep your money for you.
- The... the moment...

43:31.912 --> 43:33.314
The moment you open
that up they hold your money.

43:33.347 --> 43:34.715
The moment
you open that thing up...

43:34.748 --> 43:35.883
What?

43:37.284 --> 43:41.956
I, uh... I... I never thought
about I guess, like, what they do.

43:41.989 --> 43:44.325
You just once heard you shouldn't
do banks and now you don't do banks.

43:44.358 --> 43:47.394
Yeah. Well 'cause I heard a guy on TV
go, "The moment they..." and then, um...

43:47.428 --> 43:48.996
- You just changed the channel?
- Someone turned off the...

43:49.029 --> 43:51.132
No, it was a lightning storm,
it turned off.

43:51.165 --> 43:53.134
So we have $455.

43:53.167 --> 43:57.271
Thank you. Yes. We have
$455 between the three of us.

43:57.304 --> 43:59.840
- Yeah!
- It's very embarrassing.

43:59.874 --> 44:02.943
But, look! Hey. That's...
that's over half!

44:02.977 --> 44:05.279
- That's half way!
- That's half way, so here's what I think...

44:05.312 --> 44:09.350
we give that money to her, we say,
"Hey, good faith payment, down payment.

44:09.383 --> 44:13.754
Derek will get you the rest when he
can, on his own, 'cause fuck Derek."

44:13.787 --> 44:17.358
And from there... she should give us the
dog 'cause it's a very reasonable request,

44:17.391 --> 44:19.026
- a very reasonable thing to do.
- Yeah.

44:19.059 --> 44:21.228
Well, I... I agree,
I think it's reasonable.

44:21.262 --> 44:24.999
I... I don't think Dweeb
has an ounce of reason in him.

44:25.032 --> 44:26.901
Oh, Dweeb, I can't...
I don't know what's goin' on inside.

44:26.934 --> 44:28.369
He's a wild card, man.

44:28.402 --> 44:30.337
- Do you know that guy?
- A little bit.

44:30.371 --> 44:32.139
- What's his deal?
- We went to high school together.

44:32.173 --> 44:33.874
What was
he like in high school?

44:33.908 --> 44:34.942
He kicked the shit outta me,
like, all the time.

44:35.843 --> 44:38.879
Okay! So... Linda, hello.

44:38.913 --> 44:42.116
Um, unfortunately, we
could not get all of the money.

44:42.149 --> 44:46.086
But! We do have... $455.

44:46.120 --> 44:47.855
- Which is most of it!
- Which is over half!

44:47.888 --> 44:50.157
- It's most of it, yeah.
- Yes! Good job, Derek.

44:50.191 --> 44:53.761
It's actually over half, so, I'm thinking,
uh, a very fair deal at this point,

44:53.794 --> 44:57.164
would be we give you
this $455,

44:57.198 --> 44:59.033
you give us the dog,

44:59.066 --> 45:02.203
and we get you the rest
absolutely as soon as we can.

45:02.236 --> 45:03.804
- Soon as we can. Yeah.
- Thank you, Derek.

45:03.837 --> 45:05.773
- Wow.
- What do you think?

45:05.806 --> 45:07.875
- What do I think?
- Yeah!

45:07.908 --> 45:12.780
I think that this is very, um...
I think it's very interesting.

45:12.813 --> 45:15.082
- Okay. Interesting.
- Yeah. And I think it's interesting

45:15.115 --> 45:18.252
because you now
owe me a thousand.

45:18.285 --> 45:20.754
- What?
- What? - So...

45:20.788 --> 45:21.956
What do you mean a thousand? You can't
just throw two hundred dollars on it!

45:21.989 --> 45:23.824
- Ah, and, yet, I did.
- Why?

45:23.857 --> 45:26.327
Why? Okay, now this is... Mwah!
Now this is for two reasons.

45:26.360 --> 45:28.862
- Do you wanna hear 'em? The two reasons?
- Two reasons. Great.

45:28.896 --> 45:30.998
- Can't wait to hear the list.
- Two reasons. Of course. So the list is brief,

45:31.031 --> 45:33.767
but it goes like this:
number 1; interest. Right?

45:33.801 --> 45:36.136
I mean, I don't know, have you guys,
uh, have you heard of interest?

45:36.170 --> 45:38.239
- Yeah.
- Yes, I've heard of interest. It takes, like, months!

45:38.272 --> 45:40.341
- I bet you've heard of interest. Right? Yeah.
- I have, yeah.

45:40.374 --> 45:42.776
It's a little bit of money you put
on the top of a bigger piece of money

45:42.810 --> 45:45.779
When people owe you money for a long
period of time. Not for two hours.

45:45.813 --> 45:47.948
Well, it works differently
in crime.

45:47.982 --> 45:51.118
- Can it work for two hours?
- I mean, crime, rules are out the window.

45:51.151 --> 45:53.220
As far as I understand
from TV and film.

45:53.254 --> 45:55.222
- Mm-hmm.
- Ugh. Damn it!

45:55.256 --> 46:00.094
So! Reason number two, sweetheart,
is, um, how fucking dare you?

46:00.127 --> 46:02.496
- Okay.
- Huh?

46:02.530 --> 46:06.534
How fucking dare you come into my house,
and act like you're the one in charge.

46:06.568 --> 46:09.236
- I... didn't say that.
- When pretty clearly...

46:09.270 --> 46:12.072
- it's me who's in charge. Right?
- I agree. Sure! You're in charge. I agree! Unh-uh.

46:12.106 --> 46:15.142
Need I remind you about what
happened the last time you were here?

46:15.175 --> 46:17.845
No. I don't need a reminder.

46:17.878 --> 46:19.813
Because I will give you a little refresher about
what happened the last time you were here!

46:19.847 --> 46:21.882
I remember. I remember.

46:21.915 --> 46:24.218
- Which is that I broke your friend's fucking finger.
- Uh! Ah!

46:24.251 --> 46:26.521
- Do you not remember that? Do you not recall that?
- I don't remember that at all.

46:26.554 --> 46:29.089
- I don't remember that at all. I remember he broke the finger!
- Oh, really?

46:29.123 --> 46:30.525
- He broke the finger? Huh!
- I remember you stood there and you didn't do shit.

46:30.558 --> 46:32.527
- Luke, shut...
- 'Cause you're full'a shit.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.596
What's wrong with you, Luke?
Shut up, you're making it worse!

46:34.629 --> 46:36.363
- You're gonna make this worse!
- She's fake, man, she's fakin' it.

46:36.397 --> 46:37.865
- She's whispering to Dweeb right now!
- Well.

46:37.898 --> 46:39.166
They can whisper
if they wanna whisper.

46:39.199 --> 46:41.302
- Could just be a secret.
- Look!

46:41.335 --> 46:43.538
- No! Dweeb! Fuck!
- Oh, my God, dude! What the fuck are you doing?

46:43.571 --> 46:45.372
What are you doing? Why are you acting
like you don't know what happened?

46:45.406 --> 46:47.107
- Dweeb!
- What is this? What does this mean?

46:47.141 --> 46:48.409
What's wrong with you?
Why'd you do that?

46:48.442 --> 46:50.044
Take it easy!
Okay, look, here we go!

46:50.077 --> 46:52.479
A thousand now,
we've got four... fifty-five.

46:52.514 --> 46:54.948
So that makes five... Eh, he's no good for
math right now. Five... Uh, five fifty-five!

46:54.982 --> 46:56.850
- Five forty-five!
- Five forty-five! We owe you five forty-five now!

46:56.884 --> 46:58.285
- Hmm?
- It's actually eleven hundred.

46:58.319 --> 47:00.020
- What? - Why?
- Why's it eleven hundred?

47:00.054 --> 47:01.523
Because you made my man
waste a bullet.

47:01.556 --> 47:03.957
Uh! Bullets aren't
worth a hundred dollars!

47:03.991 --> 47:06.927
He really, really loves his bullets.
It would just mean a lot.

47:06.960 --> 47:08.929
- These are my best bullets!
- Yeah.

47:08.962 --> 47:11.498
Okay. Sure. No, okay.
Hundred-dollar bullets. Fair enough.

47:11.533 --> 47:13.967
So, eleven hundred now, that makes...
six fifty-five... six forty-five.

47:14.001 --> 47:16.937
- Six forty-five. Harry?
- Forty-five. Agh! - Six forty-five!

47:16.970 --> 47:19.206
We'll get it to you...
very soon. Okay?

47:19.239 --> 47:23.110
You, my friend,
have 22 hours to get back to me.

47:23.143 --> 47:25.279
- Okay.
- Okay, let's... let's just go! Let's just go then!

47:25.312 --> 47:27.649
- Yeah.
- Here ya go.

47:27.682 --> 47:29.617
- Come on! Come on, Harry! - Okay, come on.
- Give me one second!

47:29.651 --> 47:31.952
You don't get one, man.
I'd like to go now. Come on.

47:31.985 --> 47:34.088
- No time! Come on!
- Get up. Here we go. Everything's fine.

47:34.121 --> 47:36.591
- Lemme see it, lemme see it. Oh, fuck, that's bad.
- Oh, shit! OK.

47:36.624 --> 47:38.593
Yeah, just go.

47:38.626 --> 47:41.228
- It's full'a sticky stuff!
- That's blood, pal.

47:41.261 --> 47:43.063
Oh, my God, dude!

47:43.097 --> 47:45.399
This fuckin' Linda chick,
what is her deal, man?

47:45.432 --> 47:47.635
- She's clearly insane, and...
- Yes.

47:47.669 --> 47:50.971
...has a very strange
arrangement with this Dweeb guy.

47:51.004 --> 47:52.172
What is his thing,
by the way?

47:52.206 --> 47:53.541
That guy
is from another planet!

47:53.575 --> 47:55.577
There's nothin'
goin' on behind his eyes!

47:55.610 --> 47:58.112
I gotta be honest though, Luke,
I wish you'd just kinda...

47:58.145 --> 48:00.180
settle down with
antagonizing him.

48:00.214 --> 48:02.249
You're making it worse
every...

48:02.282 --> 48:04.385
- I'm not... Well, I'm not antagonizing him.
- Yes, you are!

48:04.418 --> 48:06.253
- You're making it worse every time!
- I'm antagonizing her, not him.

48:06.286 --> 48:08.422
- Okay?
- That's... She's the one that'll kill the dog!

48:08.455 --> 48:10.558
I know, but it's stupid that she's
hurtin' him! That's not my call.

48:10.592 --> 48:13.093
I... I didn't... I didn't...
tell her to hurt him. That's weird!

48:13.127 --> 48:16.964
I don't like it, but, you know what, he...
at least should be hurting Derek.

48:16.997 --> 48:19.199
- Probably you.
- Fine. Sure, me!

48:19.233 --> 48:21.435
Yeah, no, I'd love to get shot in the
arm, dude! That's a dream for me.

48:21.468 --> 48:23.103
I've been wantin' to get
shot in the arm for years.

48:23.137 --> 48:25.205
That's even... That's
way better than a scar.

48:25.239 --> 48:26.140
- Okay, shut up, shut up. Shut up, okay, shut up!
- Minimal pain.

48:26.173 --> 48:28.543
Minimal blood loss.

48:28.576 --> 48:31.078
We'd all love to get shot in the arm! It
sounds great! You get a scar, it's awesome.

48:31.111 --> 48:33.347
- It's really cool.
- Look; we need money right now, okay?

48:33.380 --> 48:35.482
We need $500
or my dog dies.

48:35.517 --> 48:37.384
- Nope.
- $645.

48:37.418 --> 48:39.621
- Oh, my God!! Ugh! Six...
- It's a lot. It's a lot more.

48:39.654 --> 48:43.023
Okay, what can we do to make a
lotta money real fast? Uh...

48:43.056 --> 48:45.392
Open up a restaurant? Uh...

48:45.426 --> 48:47.027
Let's open up
a restaurant real quick!

48:47.060 --> 48:48.630
Derek's Diner!
We'll call it Derek's Diner!

48:48.663 --> 48:51.098
We'll call it Derek's Diner!
That'll take 20 hours.

48:51.131 --> 48:53.967
Call it Derek's Diner. Come on in, my
dog's gonna die. Something like that. Um...

48:54.001 --> 48:56.704
Why don't we go to the bank
and take out a loan?

48:57.605 --> 49:00.140
- What... Uh...
- What kinda loan?

49:00.174 --> 49:02.075
How do we take
out a loan for this?

49:02.109 --> 49:07.147
Take out a loan and you just go
up there and say, "Give me $645."

49:08.148 --> 49:10.350
- And they say, "What's the loan for?" What do we say?
- Yeah.

49:10.384 --> 49:12.486
- You need to give them a reason, I think, right?
- Small business, or...

49:12.520 --> 49:15.355
Say it's a... it's a...
none of your business loan.

49:15.389 --> 49:17.357
- None of your business loan.
- That's gonna make 'em really mad.

49:17.391 --> 49:19.393
- They'll fall... No, they'll take that.
- Yeah.

49:19.426 --> 49:21.395
Yeah, they'll... Those are common.
None of your business loans?

49:21.428 --> 49:23.631
Those are very common.
They give those out all the time.

49:23.665 --> 49:25.065
- They're gonna be real...
- Especially for specifically six forty-five

49:25.098 --> 49:27.234
from a guy
who's covered in blood!

49:27.267 --> 49:30.971
I'm the most adult one here,
I'll take the heat.

49:31.773 --> 49:34.141
- You're just gonna... Jesus Christ.
- Oh, my God...

49:34.174 --> 49:37.277
This isn't your boat.
Don't just spit in here.

49:37.311 --> 49:40.080
- I don't care if you're losing all your blood.
- Wait, wait. Wait...

49:40.113 --> 49:42.182
I know somebody that has a tuba.

49:43.785 --> 49:45.653
See now... When you do
this, that means you're done,

49:45.687 --> 49:47.120
but you have to go further
than that.

49:47.154 --> 49:48.422
A tuba's worth a lotta money.

49:48.455 --> 49:50.157
How is a tuba
worth a lotta money?

49:50.190 --> 49:52.493
Ya know, ya... ya blow into it,
everybody's jealous.

49:52.527 --> 49:54.762
Everybody says
I wish I was that guy.

49:54.796 --> 49:56.631
- Tuba's are pretty cool...
- It's a... it's a matter of vanity.

49:56.664 --> 49:58.499
I do like tubas.
It's a beautiful sound!

49:58.533 --> 50:01.368
I mean... I guess they're
probably hard to make!

50:01.401 --> 50:04.238
You can sell that thing for twenty
G's tops! And the parts alone!

50:04.271 --> 50:06.641
- I mean a lotta that stuff is on spaceships.
- Those things are...

50:06.674 --> 50:08.475
- That's craftsmanship, right? That takes a lotta work.
- Yeah. Well, yeah.

50:08.510 --> 50:10.177
- For sure!
- They might be worth 645!

50:10.210 --> 50:12.279
- Probably!
- Well, but what...

50:12.312 --> 50:14.616
so this guy... this friend's just
gonna give you the tuba and...

50:14.649 --> 50:16.316
Let us go sell it, or something?

50:16.350 --> 50:19.286
I highly doubt someone
would give us a beautiful tuba.

50:19.319 --> 50:24.559
Eh... I mean... They wouldn't...
Probably wouldn't give it to us.

50:24.592 --> 50:28.095
We just... just take it.

50:28.128 --> 50:29.463
Instead.

50:29.496 --> 50:30.765
Are you talking about
stealing a tuba?

50:30.798 --> 50:32.567
I guess, yeah, it's stealing.

50:32.600 --> 50:35.168
Well... yeah!

50:35.202 --> 50:36.838
I mean, unless you wanna open up
Derek's Diner, I think this is the best idea.

50:36.871 --> 50:40.073
Shut the fuck up
about Derek's Diner. K?

50:40.107 --> 50:42.510
If she gave us two years
to get her the six forty-five,

50:42.544 --> 50:44.244
maybe we'd have time
for Derek's Diner.

50:44.278 --> 50:45.847
You could
sell breakfast for dinner.

50:45.880 --> 50:47.682
Right now, would you promise me
that if we go back there

50:47.715 --> 50:49.851
and she says you have two years,
we open up Derek's Diner?

50:49.884 --> 50:52.620
- You're on. Two years, Derek's Diner. If she gives it to us.
- Okay.

50:52.654 --> 50:54.454
Yeah!
Let's go steal a tuba!

50:56.056 --> 50:57.491
- Is this her place?
- This is... Yeah, this is it. This is it.

50:57.525 --> 50:59.293
- That's gotta be it. Look at it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:59.326 --> 51:01.128
Looks like a bank.

51:04.464 --> 51:06.801
- Just go. Go in, go in!
- Okay, let's go. Come on, come on!

51:06.834 --> 51:08.302
Whoa,
it's got two doors.

51:08.335 --> 51:09.537
Harry,
you gotta be quiet.

51:09.571 --> 51:11.606
You gotta be quiet, Harry.

51:11.639 --> 51:13.675
- It's got two doors.
- Harry, shut up! - Okay...

51:13.708 --> 51:15.710
- This is... what is this place?
- Stop! Quiet.

51:15.743 --> 51:18.145
- Listen... Do you know what we're doing?
- Remember?

51:18.178 --> 51:20.515
- We're stealing a tuba.
- Yeah, we're... at the house.

51:20.548 --> 51:22.349
- We're gettin' the tuba.
- Be quiet! Be quiet. Just wait right here.

51:22.382 --> 51:24.686
- Okay, go find the tuba...
- I'll go look this way.

51:24.719 --> 51:26.153
- We get outta here. Fast as possible. Come on!
- Yeah, for sure. Okay

51:29.791 --> 51:32.694
Shh!

51:32.727 --> 51:34.762
Harry! Be quiet!

51:41.268 --> 51:42.837
What the fuck?

51:48.710 --> 51:51.278
- Derek! Derek!
- I got it!

51:51.311 --> 51:53.246
- Derek!
- I got the tuba! I got the fricken tuba!

51:53.280 --> 51:55.349
Is this your lawyer?
Are we robbing your lawyer?

51:55.382 --> 51:57.585
Oh. No, no, that's...
that's just my friend.

51:57.619 --> 51:59.854
- She's your friend?
- Yeah, yeah!

51:59.887 --> 52:01.856
Yeah, I mean she's... she's been my only
friend ever since I lost you guys...

52:01.889 --> 52:03.591
- Oh, my God...
- I figured we could rob her

52:03.625 --> 52:05.893
and it's no big deal!
I just pay her back later.

52:05.927 --> 52:08.395
It's actually is no big deal
for me either because I don't like her!

52:08.428 --> 52:10.531
Oh, she's a really nice girl...
you gotta get... you gotta get to know her!

52:10.565 --> 52:12.265
I don't mind that we're
robbin' her 'cause I can't stand her!

52:12.299 --> 52:13.668
Spend some time
with her if you don't like her!

52:13.701 --> 52:15.202
I don't wanna
spend any time with her!

52:15.235 --> 52:16.838
You guys,
you guys, please!

52:16.871 --> 52:18.489
We gotta wrap this up, okay?
Let's just get outta here.

52:18.973 --> 52:20.742
- Hey, what's up?
- Ahh!

52:20.775 --> 52:22.877
- Oh!
- Oh! Oh, my God!

52:22.910 --> 52:24.344
- Oh, shit!
- Okay, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait!

52:24.378 --> 52:26.480
Hold on, look, look, look!
Wait!

52:26.514 --> 52:29.249
Miriam, look. It's me,
see? It's just Derek. See?

52:29.282 --> 52:30.518
- It's Luke! From the ashes!
- Luke. Remember?

52:30.551 --> 52:32.185
Are you guys here to hang out?

52:32.219 --> 52:34.254
- What?
- What are you doing with my tuba?

52:34.287 --> 52:35.690
Uh...

52:35.723 --> 52:37.659
Yeah! Yeah, we're...
we're here to hang out.

52:37.692 --> 52:40.193
- We... we came in, we, uh...
- Oh! Okay. - Yeah...

52:40.227 --> 52:43.296
We just got your tuba out, and, uh,
thought you could, like, play it for us.

52:43.330 --> 52:46.500
And we'll... we'll give you some notes!
You know, we'll say, ya know...

52:46.534 --> 52:48.936
- Hold it higher, hold it lower.
- Oh, I love that!

52:48.970 --> 52:50.638
- Isn't that great?
- Yes!

52:50.672 --> 52:52.640
You really think
that's what we're here to do?

52:52.674 --> 52:54.876
What is wrong with you?
We're wearin' fuckin' ski masks!

52:54.909 --> 52:56.944
I just thought
it was like a thing.

52:56.978 --> 52:59.479
We didn't tell you we were coming.
Obviously, we're robbing you!

52:59.514 --> 53:01.816
We came to steal your tuba because
we thought it would be worth...

53:01.849 --> 53:03.951
- What?
- ...six hundred and forty-five dollars?

53:03.985 --> 53:05.218
It might be.

53:05.252 --> 53:06.854
What the fuck is wrong with us?

53:06.888 --> 53:10.490
Six hundred and forty dollars?
That thing probably is worth...

53:10.525 --> 53:13.594
I mean less than a hund...
He bought it for me for my birthday.

53:13.628 --> 53:15.630
- It was, like, a hundred dollars.
- Oh, my God, I did!

53:15.663 --> 53:17.865
- Yeah.
- You bought the tuba?

53:17.899 --> 53:20.668
I knew... I... I held it and I was, like...
I... I've held this before.

53:20.702 --> 53:22.402
That was the first thought
I had when I picked it up.

53:22.436 --> 53:24.639
Yeah, I spent, like,
a hundred bucks on this.

53:24.672 --> 53:27.542
But now it's probably worth...
negative money.

53:27.575 --> 53:28.876
This is, like, garbage.
Yeah.

53:28.910 --> 53:30.645
There's no way
it's worth a hundred now!

53:30.678 --> 53:32.412
- Miriam's, like, ruined this thing.
- Yeah.

53:32.446 --> 53:34.682
Cause ya fuckin' beat
it to shit. It's disgusting!

53:34.716 --> 53:35.750
- It's not even a good tuba!
- What have you done to this, Miriam?

53:35.783 --> 53:37.417
I just didn't have a case, so...

53:37.451 --> 53:39.954
All right, you know what,
look... I'm done.

53:39.987 --> 53:42.924
Man, I'm done. I'm done
with all of this, all right?

53:42.957 --> 53:46.359
I can't stand this. I'm sick of all
these schemes, and comin' up with shit,

53:46.393 --> 53:48.629
and lying, and... just to try to
get some money

53:48.663 --> 53:50.430
that you need 'cause you did
somethin' fuckin' stupid

53:50.464 --> 53:52.734
and it's got nothin' to do with
me... I was happy! Okay?

53:52.767 --> 53:56.838
I was happy livin' at home, by
myself, no friends, no connections!

53:56.871 --> 53:58.573
Just me doin'
whatever I wanted to do.

53:58.606 --> 54:00.373
Now I'm here
doin' your bullshit!

54:00.407 --> 54:02.476
'Cause you make a stupid bet!

54:02.510 --> 54:04.746
And your fuckin' dog gets kidnapped.
I don't fuckin' care, man!

54:04.779 --> 54:07.949
I'm sorry that you got hurt a bunch,
but I don't care about you either!

54:07.982 --> 54:10.551
- Whatever.
- I'm done.

54:10.585 --> 54:13.988
I mean... You can't be done.
I mean, my dog's gonna die!

54:14.021 --> 54:15.890
If we don't get the money...
We're so close to getting the money!

54:15.923 --> 54:18.059
- Derek! Derek!
- Luke! You have to stay around!

54:18.092 --> 54:20.427
- You have to stay around...
- Listen to me. Listen to me!

54:20.460 --> 54:22.663
I don't care about your dog.
Okay?

54:22.697 --> 54:26.500
I do not care if your dog dies.
I don't know why I ever did!

54:26.534 --> 54:28.703
I never shoulda
come to any of this, okay?

54:28.736 --> 54:31.338
I should have thrown those ashes in the
trash like I did in the first place!

54:31.371 --> 54:35.743
I shoulda left 'em in the trash!
'Cause that's where they were! Okay?

54:37.377 --> 54:39.847
Fine. That's fine.

54:39.881 --> 54:41.716
- Okay?
- Yeah!

54:41.749 --> 54:44.552
- Goodbye. Good luck.
- Bye.

54:48.589 --> 54:50.892
So... is this, like...
still a hangout?

54:52.560 --> 54:54.796
I just wasn't clear.
If this was a hangout.

54:54.829 --> 54:56.631
- This is a hangout, right?
- Yeah. Yeah, we can hangout.

54:56.664 --> 54:58.431
Okay. Cool.

55:00.034 --> 55:02.502
- Oh, yeah, it's that white Prius there.
- All right, cool.

55:02.537 --> 55:05.438
- You can just pull right in front.
- Great... great.

55:05.472 --> 55:09.577
All right! Thanks,
man. Um...

55:09.610 --> 55:11.344
I'll just tip you on the app.
Yeah?

55:11.378 --> 55:13.346
Cool, yeah. How much?

55:13.380 --> 55:15.016
- What?
- I mean, how much, dude?

55:15.049 --> 55:17.417
It's gonna be like two
hours to get back home.

55:17.450 --> 55:19.486
I guess... Yeah,
I'll give you a good tip.

55:19.520 --> 55:21.789

- Pfft. Yeah, good tip.

55:21.823 --> 55:23.825
All right, thanks dude,

55:23.858 --> 55:25.793
Have a good night!

55:25.827 --> 55:27.862
Okay, sure man, you, too.
Thanks for everything.

55:27.895 --> 55:29.764
So sorry to inconvenience you.

55:54.589 --> 55:58.391
Man... I like
"Like a Virgin" Madonna...

55:58.425 --> 56:01.062
way better than
any other Madonna.

56:01.095 --> 56:03.564
- Yeah, I mean, that is, like the best Madonna.
- I think so, right?

56:03.598 --> 56:04.932
- All right man, I'm goin' up.
- All right, bud.

56:04.966 --> 56:07.068
I'll see you upstairs, man.

56:07.101 --> 56:09.136
Luke! What's up, man?

56:09.170 --> 56:11.471

56:11.505 --> 56:13.107
- Haha, you remembered! Good man, good man.
- I remembered.

56:13.140 --> 56:15.910
- Look at that, huh? Learnin'.
- I like it.

56:15.943 --> 56:19.914
Hey, uh, me and Rod are gonna
go up and have some drinks.

56:19.947 --> 56:23.117
Smoke a little bit. You're welcome
to come through if you like.

56:25.052 --> 56:26.486
You want me to come
have a drink with you?

56:26.520 --> 56:27.622
Yeah!

56:28.890 --> 56:34.128
I... I mean... What? I...
You were screamin' at me yesterday.

56:34.161 --> 56:36.530
You said you hate me, everybody
in the building hates me.

56:36.564 --> 56:38.666
What am I...

56:38.699 --> 56:40.034
And now you wanna come...
You want me to have a drink with you?

56:40.067 --> 56:42.136
- Yeah, man!
- How does that work?

56:42.169 --> 56:44.772
Aw, come on, that was yesterday,
I was upset, I got it off my chest.

56:44.805 --> 56:49.176
You seem like you took it all in and,
ya know, it's, uh, water over the bridge!

56:49.210 --> 56:51.444
Under the bridge? Over...?

56:51.478 --> 56:52.680
- Water under the bridge, yeah.
- Yeah, that one, that one.

56:52.713 --> 56:54.447
- It's all good!
- That's it.

56:54.481 --> 56:55.816
- That's it! Yeah.
- Just like that.

56:57.318 --> 56:58.686
- Yeah!
- Three... three years'a hatin' me and it's gone in a day.

56:58.719 --> 57:02.189
It wasn't three years. It was just
that moment in time right there.

57:02.223 --> 57:03.791
- But, you know...
- Okay. Sure, man.

57:03.824 --> 57:06.093
Yeah, man!
You gotta get over it.

57:06.127 --> 57:09.764
Wow, ha... have you
never forgiven anybody?

57:09.797 --> 57:11.032
Have I for...

57:12.800 --> 57:14.969
Whoa, whoa.

57:15.002 --> 57:16.938
You haven't, have you?
Oh, man...

57:16.971 --> 57:19.774
I can't think of a time I have.
Is that weird?

57:19.807 --> 57:21.175
It is kinda weird, man!

57:21.208 --> 57:22.843
Most people forgive people,
don't they?

57:22.877 --> 57:24.946
Yeah, I think so!
We gotta work on you, man.

57:24.979 --> 57:26.514
You're still a work in progress.

57:26.547 --> 57:27.682
That's... Okay.

57:27.715 --> 57:29.917
Forget everything I said.

57:29.951 --> 57:32.653
Forget the invite. Actually,
all of us neighbors are gonna get together

57:32.687 --> 57:34.121
and get you evicted, bud.

57:34.155 --> 57:35.957
- Yeah, that's what we're gonna do.
- Yeah.

57:35.990 --> 57:38.259
No. Do your thing, man.
Do what you gotta do.

57:38.292 --> 57:40.895
Look, I'm jokin', man. Look, look, look,
come over and have a drink with us!

57:40.928 --> 57:43.064
No, I know you're joking. Sorry. No, I
just... I have to go take care of something.

57:43.097 --> 57:45.232
Aye, well,
do what you gotta do, man.

57:45.266 --> 57:47.601
- All right.
- We'll be up there drinking. The invite is open.

57:47.635 --> 57:49.637
- Okay, thank you! Next time.
- All right? I'll see ya around.

57:49.670 --> 57:52.673
Yeah. Goddamn. All right.

58:04.652 --> 58:06.620
- Luke!
- Oh, shit! Derek!

58:06.654 --> 58:09.757
Dude, thank God, you're back, man!
I was panicking all night.

58:09.790 --> 58:12.593
- It's day now, I guess.
- Oh, my God! Okay. You live here?

58:12.626 --> 58:14.128
Yeah! This is my place.

58:14.161 --> 58:16.063
Oh, that's perfect!
No, yeah, I was looking for you!

58:16.097 --> 58:17.531
- Uh-huh.
- I was going to, uh, your friend's place.

58:17.565 --> 58:18.933
The one
we tried to rob last night.

58:18.966 --> 58:20.801
From last night?
Yeah, that... She's my neighbor.

58:20.835 --> 58:22.303
- She's right there!
- Yeah! We hang out all the time.

58:22.336 --> 58:24.071
- That's... really cool.
- It's pretty cool, right?

58:24.105 --> 58:25.806
That's awesome.
This looks like a fun set up, man.

58:25.840 --> 58:27.942
Thanks, man. Yeah, I've done
a lot with it, I think.

58:27.975 --> 58:29.110
That's cool, that's great, okay,
look, we're gonna get your dog back.

58:29.143 --> 58:31.545
- Yes, man! Yes.
- Okay.

58:31.579 --> 58:33.114
But look, we gotta find Harry, okay?
It's gotta be the three of us, right?

58:33.147 --> 58:34.648
- Just like you always wanted.
- Old times!

58:34.682 --> 58:36.684
- Like old times.
- Like old times.

58:36.717 --> 58:38.152
- Here's the problem, I don't know where Harry is.
- Oh, shit.

58:38.185 --> 58:39.754
I went by his house,
he wasn't there.

58:39.787 --> 58:41.322
So I think we just gotta run
around town,

58:41.355 --> 58:42.957
do whatever we can to find him
as fast as we can, okay?

58:42.990 --> 58:44.258
- Totally. Yeah, yeah.
- I know where he is!

58:44.291 --> 58:46.594
Oh! My God. Come on!
That's twice.

58:46.627 --> 58:48.162
Uh, great!
You know where Harry is!

58:48.195 --> 58:51.198
- Yeah!
- Uh... and... and you're gonna tell us?

58:51.232 --> 58:52.666
Yeah, sure, why not?

58:52.700 --> 58:54.902
That's... Ugh,
thank you so much.

58:54.935 --> 58:57.038
I mean, we were just robbin' you last
night and you're still gonna help us?

58:57.071 --> 58:59.040
Yeah, I understand. You're just
trying to get Derek's dog back.

58:59.073 --> 59:00.875
- That's amazing. - What a good friend, huh?
- She's great!

59:00.908 --> 59:02.610
- She's great.
- You're great! Thank you so much.

59:02.643 --> 59:04.278
- I like the bucket hat thing.
- Yeah. Aw, thanks.

59:04.311 --> 59:06.147
- You got a real cool style goin'...
- It's a good look.

59:06.180 --> 59:07.214
- Okay, great! Where's Harry?
- Oh, he's right over there.

59:08.517 --> 59:10.751
- Oh, my God! Shit, that's his car. Oh, come on!
- Oh! Yeah.

59:12.653 --> 59:14.722
- Harry!
- Whoa!

59:14.755 --> 59:15.656
Harry!

59:17.958 --> 59:19.193
- Harry!!
- Is he alive?

59:19.226 --> 59:20.327
- Harry!
- Roll... Oh, my God.

59:20.361 --> 59:22.363
Hey! You okay?

59:22.396 --> 59:24.598
- Hey! What's up?
- Can you roll your window down?

59:24.632 --> 59:26.333
Roll down your window
so we can check your pulse.

59:27.968 --> 59:32.139
- Hey! Are you all right?
- Yeah! Yeah.

59:32.173 --> 59:34.075
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah! Fine.

59:34.108 --> 59:36.110
You're just sittin' in your car,
man. You were asleep.

59:37.144 --> 59:39.080
Yeah, so could take...
takin' a nap. It's fine.

59:39.113 --> 59:40.815
- What a...
- Did you pass out or somethin'?

59:40.848 --> 59:42.183
Gotta sleep. Ya know?
Everybody sleeps.

59:42.216 --> 59:43.651
You just passed out in the car?

59:43.684 --> 59:45.386
Come in...
Your place you sleep.

59:45.419 --> 59:47.388
- Okay.
- Yeah...

59:47.421 --> 59:49.690
- All right. You sure you're all right?
- Yeah, fine, man.

59:49.723 --> 59:53.627
Okay, look. Look, listen; guys,
I need to say something, okay?

59:53.661 --> 59:55.062
Something I should
have said a long time ago.

59:55.096 --> 59:56.630
Okay.

59:57.398 --> 1:00:01.402
I forgive you. Okay?
I forgive you.

1:00:01.435 --> 1:00:03.838
Wh... For... for what?

1:00:03.871 --> 1:00:05.940
For this... You know, the thing.
That I've been holding on to,

1:00:05.973 --> 1:00:07.908
the stuff with the drugs and getting
arrested. And then the egg thing.

1:00:07.942 --> 1:00:09.376
No, no,
you should be doing...

1:00:09.410 --> 1:00:11.278
I've been holding onto it
all these years, and...

1:00:11.312 --> 1:00:13.314
No, you should be doing the
opposite thing right now, man!

1:00:13.347 --> 1:00:14.882
- Oh, apologizing? Oh, no, yeah, apologizing!
- Yeah!

1:00:14.915 --> 1:00:16.717
- That makes way more sense.
- No, yeah!

1:00:16.750 --> 1:00:18.853
- No, I'm sorry about the hand...
- Look what ya did to him.

1:00:18.886 --> 1:00:20.955
Yeah, I'm sorry about the hand,
and the gunshot, and the... the Frisbee,

1:00:20.988 --> 1:00:22.923
and I'm... I'm sorry I bailed last night.
That was kinda shitty.

1:00:22.957 --> 1:00:24.725
- Yeah.
- I'm actually sorry about everything I said to you,

1:00:24.758 --> 1:00:25.860
- but... Oh, wait, what's your name?
- Miriam.

1:00:25.893 --> 1:00:27.194
Miriam!
Wow, that's a cool name.

1:00:27.228 --> 1:00:28.929
Did I never say that?
She's Miriam.

1:00:28.963 --> 1:00:30.297
- It fits the whole character...
- Yeah.

1:00:30.331 --> 1:00:32.733
But, no! I'm doin' this
forgiveness thing.

1:00:32.766 --> 1:00:34.268
I'm... I've realized I, uh...
I've never been good at forgiving people,

1:00:34.301 --> 1:00:35.202
and that's held me back in life,
and I'm very alone.

1:00:35.236 --> 1:00:37.438
And that's a bad thing.

1:00:37.471 --> 1:00:40.107
So, uh, I am trying to forgive you
guys so we can become friends again!

1:00:40.141 --> 1:00:42.276
- Okay. Yeah.
- I wanna be friends again!

1:00:42.309 --> 1:00:43.911
Whatever you need to do, man.
Yeah, I'm glad to be friends. Sure.

1:00:43.944 --> 1:00:46.380
Thank you. Okay, great.
Great! Here's the thing,

1:00:46.413 --> 1:00:48.682
we're gonna get
Derek's dog back. Okay?

1:00:48.716 --> 1:00:50.784
We're gonna get Derek's dog back,
but we gotta do it together.

1:00:50.818 --> 1:00:53.687
All three of us.
Just like old times. You in?

1:00:55.022 --> 1:00:56.957
- Yeah.
- All right, Harry's in!

1:00:56.991 --> 1:00:58.692
That was really easy.
I thought that would be harder.

1:00:58.726 --> 1:01:01.061
Okay, here we go,
here's what we're gonna do...

1:01:01.095 --> 1:01:04.798
we go over to Linda's, get in there,
grab that dog, get the heck out.

1:01:04.832 --> 1:01:06.734
Yeah.

1:01:06.767 --> 1:01:08.769
So wh... what is...
the plan, then?

1:01:08.802 --> 1:01:10.237
That's it... No, yeah.
That's the plan.

1:01:10.271 --> 1:01:12.740
But they're inside.

1:01:12.773 --> 1:01:14.408
Oh, yeah, Linda and Dweeb. Yeah,
they'll probably do something, won't they?

1:01:14.441 --> 1:01:16.210
- Yeah. They'll be inside.
- Uh... Okay.

1:01:16.243 --> 1:01:18.212
Yeah, we probably need, uh,
uh, what else can we do?

1:01:18.245 --> 1:01:20.347
A diversion.

1:01:20.381 --> 1:01:23.450
Oh! I have an idea.

1:01:23.484 --> 1:01:26.487
- Miriam, do you wanna help out?
- Yeah, I'll help.

1:01:26.521 --> 1:01:28.389
Miriam's on board.

1:02:16.837 --> 1:02:18.038
Eh, 'scuse me?

1:02:20.241 --> 1:02:22.443
What're ya doin'?

1:02:22.476 --> 1:02:26.313

1:02:34.888 --> 1:02:36.924
This... this...
this lady is playing the tuba.

1:02:36.957 --> 1:02:39.026
I don't know where she came from,
I don't know what she's doin'.

1:02:39.059 --> 1:02:41.795
- Ya gotta... Ma'am, ya gotta stop!
- Cut it out, please!

1:02:43.063 --> 1:02:44.999
- Stop it!
- Could you stop it with the tuba-ing?

1:02:45.032 --> 1:02:48.135
- Stop it! Say, "stop!"
- Stop.

1:02:48.168 --> 1:02:50.170
Go get her. Go tell her to stop.
Go take it away.

1:02:50.204 --> 1:02:51.438
- Why?
- 'Cause it's your job! That's why!

1:02:51.472 --> 1:02:53.240
Oh, okay, yeah, you're right.

1:02:53.274 --> 1:02:55.577
What is this? What are we doin'?
Can we stop?

1:02:55.610 --> 1:02:57.945
- Stop!
- Can we just stop with the tuba?

1:02:57.978 --> 1:03:00.114
- Hey, I'm not... - Ma'am.
- I just need you to stop.

1:03:00.147 --> 1:03:02.049
- Ooh, grab the tuba!
- Stop!

1:03:02.082 --> 1:03:03.350
- Grab the... grab the tuba.
- I don't wanna...

1:03:03.384 --> 1:03:05.052
- But I'm gonna. Stop it!
- Oh! Get her.

1:03:05.085 --> 1:03:06.887
- Stop it! Come 'ere! Stop!
- Go get her!

1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:09.056
It's not funny!
Stop! Stop.

1:03:09.089 --> 1:03:10.424
Wait a minute,
wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1:03:10.457 --> 1:03:13.894
- I... I...
- Can she even play the tuba?

1:03:13.927 --> 1:03:15.863
No, of course, not. No, she's awful.
No, she can't play.

1:03:15.896 --> 1:03:17.464
- Oh, my God. All right, come on!
- Okay, cool. Let's go.

1:03:17.498 --> 1:03:20.134
- Oh!
- Stop! Stop!

1:03:21.201 --> 1:03:23.571
Okay, come on,
come on. Right here?

1:03:23.605 --> 1:03:26.940
Just go. Luke!
Luke, this way.

1:03:26.974 --> 1:03:28.842
Okay! Go, go, go.

1:03:28.876 --> 1:03:30.244
- I found the door.
- Shh! Shut up, be quiet.

1:03:34.181 --> 1:03:35.849
Harry, what're ya doin'?
Come on!

1:03:35.883 --> 1:03:37.519
- I slammed my hand in the door!
- Where is she?

1:03:37.552 --> 1:03:39.554
Monkey! Hey, sweetheart!
Hello! Monkey!

1:03:39.587 --> 1:03:42.089
I gotta go pee!

1:03:42.122 --> 1:03:45.125
- Stop that playing right now.
- Why... Just grab her with your hands!

1:03:45.159 --> 1:03:47.161
- Ooh, stop it!
- With your hands grab her.

1:03:47.194 --> 1:03:48.896
- What do you say? How do you call her?
- It's daddy!

1:03:48.929 --> 1:03:51.098
- You say, "It's me, daddy!"
- It's me, daddy!

1:03:51.131 --> 1:03:52.966
- Well, no, no, say I'm with daddy. 'Cause it's you.
- I'm with daddy!

1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.102
Here, I got her. Oh...
I got her. Oh! I got. Here...

1:03:55.135 --> 1:03:56.403
- Oh, come 'ere, come 'ere, come 'ere. Stop!
- Okay.

1:03:56.437 --> 1:03:58.606
Guys, what are we doin'?
What is this?

1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:00.974
What do you mean, "What are we
doing?" We're trying to find the dog!

1:04:01.008 --> 1:04:02.544
- Keep your voice down!
- What are we gonna do after we find the dog?

1:04:02.577 --> 1:04:04.478
- We go home! Everything's fine!
- We're gonna go!

1:04:04.512 --> 1:04:06.413
- You don't think Linda knows where Derek lives?
- Shh!

1:04:06.447 --> 1:04:07.948
- Oh, shit, no...
- Dweeb's gonna kick the shit outta you!

1:04:07.981 --> 1:04:09.350
Yeah, Dweeb's gonna
fuckin' kill me!

1:04:09.383 --> 1:04:11.251
- Does she know where you live?
- She does.

1:04:11.285 --> 1:04:12.986
- She knows where you live?
- She knows where I live.

1:04:13.020 --> 1:04:15.022
- Oh, that's a problem.
- This plan sucks!

1:04:15.055 --> 1:04:17.424
- I'm dea...!
- But she's not gonna do anything about it.

1:04:17.458 --> 1:04:19.259
- She'll probably drop it!
- We didn't think this through. No. She is not gonna drop it...

1:04:19.293 --> 1:04:21.028
- Is this a bad plan?
- It's... a very bad plan.

1:04:21.061 --> 1:04:23.430
Okay. No, it's fine. No, no,
no, no, no! It's fine.

1:04:23.464 --> 1:04:26.133
- Well, we'll find the...
- Look, we'll find the dog. We're doing it as friends.

1:04:26.166 --> 1:04:28.202
- Yeah, we're friends!
- We're doing the friends thing. We're coming back together.

1:04:28.235 --> 1:04:30.170
- Everything's fine.
- We're friends, we're together at last!

1:04:30.204 --> 1:04:30.971
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait...
Where's the tuba?

1:04:32.373 --> 1:04:34.141
Shit. Okay. Find the dog!
Monkey. Monkey!

1:04:34.174 --> 1:04:35.209
- Ya lookin' for this? Eh?
- Oh! Oh shit! - Oh!

1:04:35.242 --> 1:04:37.311
I'm sorry, guys, I blew it!

1:04:37.344 --> 1:04:39.346
Miriam, it's fine! Don't worry about it.
It's okay, it's okay.

1:04:39.380 --> 1:04:42.449
Oh, this is nice! It's kinda
nice, you guys are friends. Right?

1:04:42.483 --> 1:04:45.152
You got a nice little gang
goin', four people. Very nice.

1:04:45.185 --> 1:04:46.654
There's only one problem,
though, huh?

1:04:46.688 --> 1:04:48.956
Which is that you
broke into my house, right?

1:04:48.989 --> 1:04:50.391
And who knows
what you were gonna do?

1:04:50.424 --> 1:04:51.925
No one could say, really.
Huh?

1:04:51.959 --> 1:04:53.661
We were
just trying to get the dog.

1:04:53.695 --> 1:04:55.630
Get the dog, that's all we ever
wanted to do! The whole time!

1:04:55.663 --> 1:04:57.699
Oh, really? Well,
we have no way of knowing that. Do we.

1:04:57.732 --> 1:05:00.267
- Well, that's all we've ever wanted, is the dog!
- That's all we ever did!

1:05:00.300 --> 1:05:02.102
That's interesting. See, because all I
wanted, all along, was just to get my money!

1:05:02.136 --> 1:05:05.507
That I'm owed. That's it.
That is all I wanted!

1:05:05.540 --> 1:05:10.177
No more, ah! No less. Okay? So now,
I'm in a little bit of an awkward position.

1:05:10.210 --> 1:05:13.213
Right? Because I'm gonna
have to do something! Aren't I?

1:05:13.247 --> 1:05:15.650
I'm gonna have to do something
a little drastic. Huh?

1:05:15.683 --> 1:05:18.586
No. Uh... Linda! Linda, no!
No, ju... just please!

1:05:18.620 --> 1:05:20.622
Please, just don't do anything to her!
We don't need...

1:05:20.655 --> 1:05:23.357
All right, just stop, just stop,
just shut up! Just stop. All right!

1:05:23.390 --> 1:05:26.460
This is bull shit! It's still bull shit and I
can see it in your eyes that you're fakin' it!

1:05:26.493 --> 1:05:29.463
You're not gonna kill a fuckin' dog!
Goddamnit.

1:05:29.496 --> 1:05:32.433
So just stop it right now.
And give us the dog!

1:05:32.466 --> 1:05:34.569
What do you mean?

1:05:34.602 --> 1:05:39.039
What have I done that hasn't
proved that I'm capable of doing...

1:05:39.072 --> 1:05:41.108
- You haven't done anything!
- What do you mean?

1:05:41.141 --> 1:05:43.745
- You haven't done shit!
- Your friend's fingers got broken. Okay?

1:05:43.778 --> 1:05:47.347
- By him.
- He got shot. Okay? - By him.

1:05:47.381 --> 1:05:52.052
What more can I do to show you
that I'm gonna do something? Huh?

1:05:52.085 --> 1:05:54.021
- Did you see that?
- What do you mean?

1:05:54.054 --> 1:05:56.390
- She's breaking.
- What do you mean? I'm not breaking.

1:05:56.423 --> 1:05:58.726
- She's breaking character. She's breaking character!
- I'm not breaking!

1:05:58.760 --> 1:06:00.628
- I'm breaking char... I'm not breaking character!
- Look, she tried so hard.

1:06:00.662 --> 1:06:02.229
She threw on the cool jacket,
she's got the hair up in a pony.

1:06:02.262 --> 1:06:04.198
The jacket's
just a jacket that I have!

1:06:04.231 --> 1:06:06.534
She's trying to look
even cooler now!

1:06:06.568 --> 1:06:08.770
- I'm not trying to look cool, what do you mean?
- Look. Look, look, look!

1:06:08.803 --> 1:06:10.337
- No, I got her. I got you!
- What do you mean? What do you mean?

1:06:10.370 --> 1:06:12.507
I got you!!
You're not gonna do shit.

1:06:12.540 --> 1:06:15.008
- You're not gonna do shit.
- You do not wanna talk to me this way, okay?

1:06:15.042 --> 1:06:17.077
- Why not?
- Because!

1:06:17.110 --> 1:06:19.480
- What're ya gonna do?
- Because, then I'm... I'm gonna shoot the dog!

1:06:19.514 --> 1:06:22.082
- Okay, go for it!
- No, Luke! No, no, no, no!

1:06:22.115 --> 1:06:24.418
- I'm gonna do it!
- No, no, no, stay with me! Stay with me, stay with me.

1:06:24.451 --> 1:06:27.488
Again, I... I've done nothing that hasn't
proved that I'm willing to do this.

1:06:27.522 --> 1:06:31.726
So... so don't push me. Man.
Okay? 'Cause I will do it.

1:06:31.759 --> 1:06:34.596
Then do it.
I wanna see you do it.

1:06:36.296 --> 1:06:39.166
You don't wanna, do ya? Look at that!

1:06:39.199 --> 1:06:41.502
I knew you don't.
I knew you've been faking this whole time.

1:06:41.536 --> 1:06:44.271
Actually! You know what? At this point,
I'd love to see you kill the dog.

1:06:44.304 --> 1:06:46.106
- I wanna see it.
- So what, who cares?

1:06:46.139 --> 1:06:47.407
I wanna
see you kill the dog!

1:06:47.441 --> 1:06:48.776
You can't talk to me this way,
man.

1:06:48.810 --> 1:06:50.477
Just kill the fucking dog
already, Linda!

1:06:50.512 --> 1:06:52.814
You can't...
Don't talk to me this way.

1:06:52.847 --> 1:06:54.248
- Just prove me wrong and kill the fucking dog!
- Because I will do it!

1:06:54.281 --> 1:06:56.383
Oh, fuck!

1:06:56.416 --> 1:06:58.185
- Oh, my fuck. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Holy shit!

1:06:58.218 --> 1:07:01.255
- Ahh!
- Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

1:07:01.288 --> 1:07:03.257
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!
- You fucking killed my dog!

1:07:03.290 --> 1:07:05.192
I'm sorry, I had no idea.
I didn't know.

1:07:05.225 --> 1:07:06.728
What do you mean,
you didn't know?

1:07:06.761 --> 1:07:09.196
You said you were gonna
do it and then you did that!

1:07:09.229 --> 1:07:11.431
- I didn't know, I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.
- What's wrong with you?

1:07:11.465 --> 1:07:13.701
- Okay, you know what? You know what? How about this?
- I'm sorry!

1:07:13.735 --> 1:07:17.539
How about this? My bad.
That's my bad.

1:07:17.572 --> 1:07:20.307
All right, I pushed her.
She shot the dog because of me.

1:07:20.340 --> 1:07:23.611
- Yeah.
- Um... we can chalk it up to, uh...

1:07:23.645 --> 1:07:25.547
that's one for Luke!
Big mistake.

1:07:25.580 --> 1:07:27.515
Technically,
I was right about her.

1:07:27.549 --> 1:07:29.717
Can we just acknowledge that
real quick?

1:07:29.751 --> 1:07:31.385
Yeah,
you were right about me.

1:07:31.418 --> 1:07:32.820
I was right about her,
she was doing an act.

1:07:32.854 --> 1:07:34.622
I didn't know!
I just... I li... I like movies!

1:07:34.656 --> 1:07:36.691
It was a movies thing.
I knew it. See?

1:07:36.724 --> 1:07:39.259
- Everybody likes... Everybody likes movies!
- I like movies!

1:07:39.293 --> 1:07:41.194
She just took it a little too literally.
She took it a little too literally.

1:07:41.228 --> 1:07:43.163
I like movies, I don't do that!

1:07:43.196 --> 1:07:46.099
I'm so sorry, I didn't
know, I really liked the dog!

1:07:46.133 --> 1:07:48.435
- Is she definitely dead?
- She's definitely dead.

1:07:48.468 --> 1:07:50.838
- Look at her!
- Okay. Okay! Well, I say, how about this?

1:07:50.872 --> 1:07:54.408
I think we should get out of the
room where your dog is lying dead.

1:07:54.441 --> 1:07:57.444
Do you wanna do that? Should we... should we
maybe just leave the room for the moment?

1:07:57.477 --> 1:08:01.214
- I've... That's... I mean, yeah.
- Okay, let's go. Here we go!

1:08:01.248 --> 1:08:02.884
Everybody up!
We're gonna walk out right now.

1:08:02.917 --> 1:08:05.185
Why don't you go that way
so you don't... step in the dog.

1:08:05.218 --> 1:08:06.821
Uh, well go this way.
Come on. You all right?

1:08:06.854 --> 1:08:08.388
- Yes.
- Come on.

1:08:08.422 --> 1:08:09.691
We'll go this way.
You can come too!

1:08:09.724 --> 1:08:11.726
- Should I stay?
- No, no, you can come.

1:08:11.759 --> 1:08:15.329
- Let's get outside. Let's get some fresh air!
- Okay. Um...

1:08:24.739 --> 1:08:26.841
Monkey was a good girl.

1:08:26.874 --> 1:08:30.578
She would watch me
eat breakfast and dinner.

1:08:30.612 --> 1:08:34.147
And on days when I didn't have to work,
she would watch me eat lunch, too.

1:08:36.918 --> 1:08:38.485
Goodbye, Monkey.

1:08:43.290 --> 1:08:45.093
- Goodbye, Monkey.
- Goodbye, Monkey.

1:08:46.460 --> 1:08:48.161
All right!
That was nice, Derek.

1:08:48.195 --> 1:08:49.864
Thank you.

1:08:49.897 --> 1:08:55.202
Uh, so... I guess let's start
hangin' out? Again? Right?

1:08:55.235 --> 1:08:58.573
- I would like nothing more.
- Okay. Cool.

1:08:58.606 --> 1:09:00.541
- We can do that.
- All right. Let's do it.

1:09:00.575 --> 1:09:03.176
- Happy to have ya. - I'm excited.
- Uh... next Tuesday?

1:09:03.210 --> 1:09:04.779
- How's next Tuesday sound?
- That works for me.

1:09:04.812 --> 1:09:06.948
- Yeah! I'm... I'm free. You guys?
- Okay!

1:09:06.981 --> 1:09:09.717
- I think I can do that.
- Next Tuesday. All right, let's go.

1:09:12.486 --> 1:09:14.421
Oh,
you know what we're gonna do?

1:09:14.454 --> 1:09:16.356
You're gonna watch
me eat fifty fuckin' eggs.

1:09:16.390 --> 1:09:18.425
- Okay, yeah.
- That's what we're gonna do!

1:09:18.458 --> 1:09:20.327
- Here we go! Here we go.
- I'm gonna fuckin' do it.

1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:21.796
- I'm tellin' ya.
- We got the regular, uh...

1:09:21.829 --> 1:09:23.397
- Jimmy Walnuts over here.
- Jimmy... Haha!

1:09:23.430 --> 1:09:25.232
- No, it's Joey Chestnut.
- Joey, er, yeah.

1:09:25.265 --> 1:09:26.968
I actually like
Jimmy Walnuts better.

1:09:27.001 --> 1:09:29.236
- That's what you could start callin' me!
- No! I'm not...8

1:09:29.269 --> 1:09:31.739
I'll call you "Cool Hand Luke" if you want.
Do you want that?

1:09:31.773 --> 1:09:33.675
No, no, no, I'm over "Cool Hand
Luke!" Now I want "Jimmy Walnuts."

1:09:33.708 --> 1:09:35.475
Now you're over it?

1:09:35.510 --> 1:09:37.512
That's a better nickname!

1:09:37.545 --> 1:09:39.479
"Cool Hand" is way better!
It's like you have a cool hand.

1:09:39.514 --> 1:09:40.882
No, but it's old.
It's too old, nobody knows it anymore.

1:09:40.915 --> 1:09:43.216
Everyone
knows how cool your hand is!

1:09:43.250 --> 1:09:44.284
Nobody probably even knows
about that fifty-egg thing anymore.

1:09:44.317 --> 1:09:46.453
Yeah, it's pretty dated.

1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:57.364
Okay, well, what can we do...
real fast to get some money?

1:09:57.397 --> 1:09:59.634
- Can we like...
- We need something. Is... is there something valuable?

1:09:59.667 --> 1:10:01.669
- Do you have anything valuable?
- We could invent, like, a new soda or something.

1:10:01.703 --> 1:10:03.437
- Maybe it catches on.
- That's... Yeah, what're ya thinkin'?

1:10:03.470 --> 1:10:05.673
Ginger ale for people
that like, uh, so... Coke, Coke!

1:10:05.707 --> 1:10:08.576
- Coke meets ginger ale?
- Yeah! Together at last!

1:10:08.609 --> 1:10:12.446
Honestly, not the teribblest idea. We
don't have time to make a new soda. Okay?

1:10:14.414 --> 1:10:17.552
- What's up?
- You shave your hole?

1:10:19.687 --> 1:10:21.689
- The crack?
- Do I... do I shave my butthole? Is that what you're asking?

1:10:21.723 --> 1:10:23.290
- Yeah! Yeah.
- I don't, man. No.

1:10:23.323 --> 1:10:26.426
I'm lookin' for, like...
razor recs.

1:10:26.460 --> 1:10:28.763
- Recommendations for...
- Recommendations, yeah.

1:10:28.796 --> 1:10:31.666
- I wouldn't know, man, I think...
- I keep... I keep fuckin' knickin' the sphinct!

1:10:31.699 --> 1:10:33.568
Well, here's the thing, I don't think
you're supposed to shave it, man.

1:10:33.601 --> 1:10:36.037
I think you get it waxed, like,
at a... a professional place.

1:10:36.070 --> 1:10:38.305
- Do you do that?
- Mm-hmm. I think you're supposed to get it waxed.

1:10:38.338 --> 1:10:40.340
I don't think
you shave your butthole. Okay?

1:10:41.475 --> 1:10:43.911
- Do they... finish the job?
- It's the wax thing.

1:10:43.945 --> 1:10:45.947
Yeah! They... they wax your butthole.
They take off all the hair.

1:10:45.980 --> 1:10:48.348
- No, do they finish the job?
- What do you mean finish the job?

1:10:48.381 --> 1:10:50.551
- Do they... I mean, is it one of those places where...
- Like a massage place?

1:10:50.585 --> 1:10:53.654
I don't think the places that wax
your butthole also give you handjobs.

1:10:53.688 --> 1:10:55.388
- If that's what you're asking.
- Why not?

1:10:55.422 --> 1:10:57.992
It doesn't sou... I don't think
they go together. Okay?

1:10:58.025 --> 1:10:59.894
- Let's go! - Thank you.
- All right.

1:10:59.927 --> 1:11:03.064
Don't! Stop it! We are not best
friends, put your hands down.

1:11:03.097 --> 1:11:04.599
Put your hands down!

1:11:06.033 --> 1:11:08.368
I make my
own beef jerky now!

1:11:08.401 --> 1:11:10.838
- Come on, don't! That doesn't make sense.
- What? Is it good?

1:11:10.872 --> 1:11:14.542
- I'm comin' back. Okay?
- Okay, no touching!

1:11:14.575 --> 1:11:18.546
No touching yet.
If you come back later, maybe.

1:11:18.579 --> 1:11:21.616
Are you gettin' this?
Cover your ears.

1:11:21.649 --> 1:11:23.350
Couple'a healthy boys
like that...

1:11:23.383 --> 1:11:25.787
We gotta get
something expensive, man!

1:11:25.820 --> 1:11:30.423
We gotta, like... kidnap David
from <i>David After Dentist.</i>

1:11:30.457 --> 1:11:32.425
Ah, fuck!

1:11:32.459 --> 1:11:34.629
Ah, fuck!

1:11:34.662 --> 1:11:36.597
Ah, fuck!

1:11:36.631 --> 1:11:38.465
Ah, fuck!

1:11:38.498 --> 1:11:39.600
Ah, fuck!

1:11:39.634 --> 1:11:41.569
Jesus, Luke!

1:11:41.602 --> 1:11:44.005
What the hell is your problem?

1:11:44.038 --> 1:11:47.942
God!
Right in the goddamn noggin'!

1:11:47.975 --> 1:11:50.812
- Lawyers don't make the laws.
- They do.

1:11:50.845 --> 1:11:52.747
No,
the... the lawmakers do!

1:11:52.780 --> 1:11:54.715
- I think I wrote one of the laws.
- You didn't.

1:11:54.749 --> 1:11:56.517
- Yeah, I did.
- How did you... What was the law?

1:11:56.551 --> 1:12:01.421
It was... um...
Thou shall not, um...

1:12:01.454 --> 1:12:03.024
- Now hold on...
- Uh...

1:12:03.057 --> 1:12:05.492
It's the one about
sleeping with your wife?

1:12:05.526 --> 1:12:07.394
I think you're talking about
a commandment!

1:12:07.427 --> 1:12:09.597
You're trying to say you wrote
one of the Ten Commandments?

1:12:09.630 --> 1:12:11.398
- Yeah, I wrote that one.
- Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife?

1:12:11.431 --> 1:12:13.000
- Yeah, I wrote that.
- Come on...

1:12:13.034 --> 1:12:15.736
I'm pretty old, too.
I'm, like, forty-nine, so...

1:12:15.770 --> 1:12:17.672
First of all;
you look amazing.

1:12:17.705 --> 1:12:19.507
I can't believe
you're forty-nine.

1:12:19.540 --> 1:12:21.108
But you would have to be way
much older than fort-nine

1:12:21.142 --> 1:12:23.511
to have written one of the
Ten Commandments!

1:12:23.544 --> 1:12:26.379
All my money's kinda tied up right now!
I got, like, three hundred bucks.

1:12:26.413 --> 1:12:27.715
What's it tied up in?

1:12:28.816 --> 1:12:31.586
- Bonds!
- James Bonds.

1:12:31.619 --> 1:12:33.486
Shut the fuck up, dude.

1:12:33.521 --> 1:12:35.890
- Hey, um, Derek...
- Yeah?

1:12:35.923 --> 1:12:37.825
You know that video I
sent you of me squeezing my nuts?

1:12:37.859 --> 1:12:39.392
Yeah, yeah.
What about it?

1:12:39.426 --> 1:12:41.095
Just don't tell
anybody about it.

1:12:41.128 --> 1:12:42.630
- What are you talkin' about?
- Okay. What?

1:12:42.663 --> 1:12:44.131
- Ma'am!
- Wh... Oh! - Ma...

1:12:44.165 --> 1:12:46.834
- Ah, oh!
- Ma... She got away from you?

1:12:48.536 --> 1:12:50.738
Ma'am!

1:12:50.771 --> 1:12:52.506
You're actin' like a lunatic! 'Cause you
got hit in the head, and you got a...

1:12:52.540 --> 1:12:54.775
Luke, I don't give
a darn! All right?

1:12:54.809 --> 1:12:56.878
There's no need to get physical
right now. Okay? Don't push me!

1:12:56.911 --> 1:12:58.713
- Can we get a thing?
- What thing?

1:12:58.746 --> 1:13:00.581
Get a thing! For me! For this!

1:13:00.615 --> 1:13:02.817
- Name what thing you want!
- It's in the trunk of the car!

1:13:02.850 --> 1:13:05.753
- It's like a cloth, wet...
- Sure! Gimme the keys and I'll get it.

1:13:06.787 --> 1:13:09.724
- Here!
- A thing? What do you mean, you got a thing?

1:13:09.757 --> 1:13:12.459
Oh, there ya go.
There you go. Good! Good!

1:13:12.492 --> 1:13:15.529
Now you can't even stand up.
Gimme the goddamn keys!

1:13:15.563 --> 1:13:16.931
Speed.

1:13:18.666 --> 1:13:22.837
This is <i>Derek's Dead,</i> scene one,
Curt in the morning... Luke in the morning!

1:13:22.870 --> 1:13:24.505
So excited!
