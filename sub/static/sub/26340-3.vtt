WEBVTT

00:00.368 --> 00:01.902
Only on Fox.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.074
Feast your eyes, Margaret.

00:07.107 --> 00:08.709
The Shady Meadows
Wednesday Afternoon

00:08.743 --> 00:10.578
Wine and Cheese Half Hour.

00:10.611 --> 00:14.482
Well, it used to be an hour,
but I had a little incident.

00:14.515 --> 00:18.753
I got cheese drunk
and punched a busboy.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.755
Look at all
these bodacious beauties.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.523
Can't you just feel the heat?

00:22.557 --> 00:25.893
Yeah, this room is humming
with sexual energy.

00:25.926 --> 00:30.898
Oh, wait, I think it might
be that guy's oxygen tank.

00:30.931 --> 00:33.668
Yeah, well, you just watch me
and Charlie work. We can't lose.

00:33.701 --> 00:38.005
(laughs) Actually, Hank, we can,
and we have been for months.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.008
-Yeah, well,
the cold streak ends tonight.
-Okay.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.510
-Here, be my wingman.
-Okay.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.412
Uh, how you doing, little missy?

00:44.445 --> 00:47.515
Are you my appendix?
'Cause I know nothing about you,

00:47.548 --> 00:49.750
but my gut tells me
to take you out.

00:52.086 --> 00:55.823
Hank, we slept together
three years ago.

00:58.293 --> 01:00.595
Wait a minute, y-you thinking
about somebody else.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.430
Oh, no, no, it was you.

01:02.463 --> 01:05.900
You cried after,
a-and then you told me

01:05.933 --> 01:08.569
that I'd never be
as good as your ex-wife.

01:10.405 --> 01:12.607
That does sound like you, Hank.
(chuckles)

01:12.640 --> 01:15.710
Remember, after the divorce,
all that crying?

01:15.743 --> 01:17.812
Marriage is complicated,
Charlie.

01:17.845 --> 01:21.215
Marriage is complicated!

01:21.248 --> 01:23.217
Well, shake it off.
That was just a rehearsal.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.052
-You up, my man.
-Okay.

01:25.085 --> 01:28.055
I'm going to take
a more direct approach.

01:28.088 --> 01:31.158
Hi, I'm Charlie.

01:31.191 --> 01:32.960
Hello. I'm Anne.

01:32.993 --> 01:37.698
Uh, listen, I haven't had sex
in about five years.

01:39.534 --> 01:43.137
And I'm betting it's probably
double that for you.

01:45.139 --> 01:48.543
So what do you say
we solve each other's problems?

01:55.816 --> 01:57.918
God, that was hard to watch.

01:57.952 --> 02:00.488
(laughs)
It was funny, but it was hard.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.924
You guys really need
to try the online dating.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.360
I mean, I do very well
because, well...

02:05.393 --> 02:07.695
(blows raspberry)
...exhibit M.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.530
It's fun.

02:09.564 --> 02:11.499
Grindr changed my life.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.702
It's like Postmates,
but instead of food,

02:14.735 --> 02:16.537
you get a man delivered.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.475
My friend Wanda found
her boyfriend online,

02:20.508 --> 02:23.010
and they were happy until
the day she passed away.

02:23.043 --> 02:25.045
-How'd she die?
-He killed her.

02:27.047 --> 02:29.283
It is the one drawback
of online dating,

02:29.316 --> 02:32.520
but other than that,
it is fantastic.

02:32.553 --> 02:35.723
Y'all are crazy. The Internet's
not for finding love,

02:35.756 --> 02:37.792
it's for faxing and Tetris.

02:37.825 --> 02:41.396
Whatever happened
to approaching a woman,

02:41.429 --> 02:44.999
buying her a drink
and assuming she owes you sex?

02:45.032 --> 02:48.369
You really need to watch
the news more.

02:49.604 --> 02:51.572
And you should really try
the online dating, Hank.

02:51.606 --> 02:55.876
I think you would do much better
with people that don't know you.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.812
I don't know this beautiful
woman over here,

02:57.845 --> 02:59.414
but I'm about to.

02:59.447 --> 03:02.617
How's it going, sweet pea?
(shouts)

03:03.918 --> 03:06.020
Damn, Raul, get a haircut.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.357
*

03:30.411 --> 03:34.682
Well, I guess this online dating
isn't the worst idea.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.884
Shady Meadows is scorched earth
for old Hank.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.554
I plowed too many
of those driveways.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.622
You're not gonna put
"plowed driveways"

03:41.656 --> 03:43.624
in your profile, are you?

03:43.658 --> 03:45.960
Course not.
I got more sense than that.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.765
Well, I'm just glad that
you realized that I'm right,

03:50.798 --> 03:53.067
because earlier, you were saying
that online dating

03:53.100 --> 03:55.402
was for "sickos and losers."

03:55.436 --> 03:58.405
Oh, it is. But I'm just trying
to have sex here, Margaret.

03:58.439 --> 04:02.076
Okay. Here we go.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.078
Name: Charlie.

04:04.111 --> 04:06.280
About Me: I love art.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.816
I have proof that the moon
landing was a hoax.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.486
And I have 27 Vietnam kills.

04:11.519 --> 04:14.221
Ooh, I wouldn't mention Vietnam.

04:14.254 --> 04:19.126
Okay. Right, I have 27 kills.

04:19.159 --> 04:20.761
Uh, don't talk
about killing anyone,

04:20.795 --> 04:23.598
and I shouldn't have
to keep saying that.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.233
Do you, Charlie.
Don't listen to these naysayers.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.568
We are just trying to help.

04:27.602 --> 04:29.403
Margaret and I do
very well online.

04:29.436 --> 04:32.006
Last month, I was featured
on the home page of Grindr

04:32.039 --> 04:34.842
due to my high number of GPWs.

04:34.875 --> 04:38.145
That's grinds per week.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.781
You two only cleaned up
'cause you're looking for men.

04:40.815 --> 04:42.983
Men will have sex with anything.

04:43.017 --> 04:44.519
Don't be jealous, Hank,

04:44.552 --> 04:46.487
because green is not
a good color on you,

04:46.521 --> 04:48.989
and while I'm on the subject,
neither is yellow or red

04:49.023 --> 04:50.891
or purple.

04:52.192 --> 04:54.361
You look bad
is what I'm saying, Hank.

04:54.394 --> 04:57.865
We'll just see about that
once I post my profile.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.768
Name: Hanky Panky.

05:00.801 --> 05:04.371
Interests: Dat ass

05:04.404 --> 05:06.774
in my hands, girl.

05:06.807 --> 05:10.511
And... golf.

05:12.046 --> 05:13.514
You guys, do you think
I should remove

05:13.548 --> 05:15.550
the picture of my 11th toe?

05:15.583 --> 05:18.853
I think you should
remove the toe.

05:18.886 --> 05:21.221
Hank, you want me to take
your profile picture?

05:21.255 --> 05:23.123
Nah, I'm gonna take it
in private.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.525
Butt naked.

05:24.559 --> 05:28.128
Ooh! I just thought
of my caption.

05:28.162 --> 05:32.533
"Hanky Panky wants a spanky."

05:37.371 --> 05:39.173
You were right, Margaret.

05:39.206 --> 05:41.008
This online dating
is the real deal.

05:41.041 --> 05:44.511
My phone hasn't blown up
this much since my daddy died.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.514
That's terrific, Hank.

05:47.548 --> 05:50.350
How about you, Charlie?
You drowning in cyber-booty?

05:50.384 --> 05:53.988
No booty. In fact,
I've only gotten one response.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.656
Hey, it only takes one.

05:55.690 --> 05:57.191
Who messaged you?

05:57.224 --> 05:58.826
One of my kids.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.528
Been trying to find me
for years. I deleted it.

06:01.562 --> 06:04.064
Yeah, buddy, that's too bad.

06:04.098 --> 06:09.503
Well, I guess I'll go figure out
the best way to light my dong.

06:09.536 --> 06:13.941
Well, if there is a market
for Hanky Panky's dong shots,

06:13.974 --> 06:15.776
then I think you have nothing
to worry about, Charlie.

06:15.810 --> 06:17.011
You keep your head up.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.846
Ah, that's sweet of you to say,

06:18.879 --> 06:23.350
but it may be just too late
for a guy like me to find love.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.253
I'm gonna go help Hank
light his dong.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.555
Oh, we need to do something.

06:28.589 --> 06:31.058
He's our friend,
he needs cheering up.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.893
We could take him
for an ice cream.

06:32.927 --> 06:34.795
Or buy him a hooker.

06:34.829 --> 06:36.797
Skipped a whole lot
of steps there.

06:36.831 --> 06:39.266
No, we don't want him
to give up on love.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.268
What if, what if we create

06:41.301 --> 06:44.038
an online profile
to flirt with Charlie?

06:44.071 --> 06:46.573
Margaret, I'm gonna tell you
what I told my baby sister

06:46.607 --> 06:49.276
when she wanted
to become a singer.

06:49.309 --> 06:51.979
Bitch, that's a terrible idea.

06:52.012 --> 06:55.249
Come on. We're just gonna
build up his confidence

06:55.282 --> 06:57.551
until he finds a real person.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.286
It's kind of like
training wheels,

06:59.319 --> 07:03.090
only the end result is riding
a lady instead of a bike.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.459
Now, we got to make sure
she's Charlie's type

07:05.492 --> 07:07.561
so that he'll take the bait.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.264
"Hi, I'm Nadine.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.432
"65 years young.

07:12.466 --> 07:17.972
The moon landing was filmed in
Hollywood by Stanley Kubrick."

07:18.005 --> 07:20.407
You got to sex that up, honey.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.609
All men are pervs, even Charlie.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.012
Ooh, I know.
Give her a mysterious name.

07:25.045 --> 07:30.017
Something like Destiny.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.653
There's nothing mysterious
about the name Destiny.

07:32.687 --> 07:34.989
She's a stripper,
mystery solved.

07:39.359 --> 07:42.129
* She'll be coming around
the mountain when she comes *

07:42.162 --> 07:43.864
* When she comes,
she'll be coming... *

07:43.898 --> 07:45.933
Whoa! No dancing.
(chuckles)

07:45.966 --> 07:48.803
Whoa, hey. Hey, gang.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.504
Guess what?

07:50.537 --> 07:55.843
My profile got a response
last night, and it is a doozy.

07:55.876 --> 07:59.613
Oh. So somebody messaged you
and now you're happy.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.348
Tell us all about
this dream girl.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.818
Ah, well, every single thing
about her is...

08:03.851 --> 08:06.386
(laughs)
...beautiful.

08:06.420 --> 08:09.523
Even her name. Destiny.

08:12.426 --> 08:14.795
Say what, now?

08:14.829 --> 08:16.731
Oh, my, my, her name is Destiny.

08:16.764 --> 08:19.366
Oh, she sounds mysterious.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.368
And sexy.

08:21.401 --> 08:23.470
Exactly what a man would want.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.673
So did you hear
from anybody else?

08:26.707 --> 08:28.843
-You get any other bites?
-Ah, yes actually.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.145
Some Nadine lady...
(laughs)

08:31.178 --> 08:34.181
...claiming that the moon
landing was filmed in Hollywood.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.083
What an idiot.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.186
Everybody knows it was filmed

08:39.219 --> 08:43.657
in an airplane hanger
in Southern Utah. Duh.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.493
Well, it sounds like you have
a lot to talk to her about.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.764
Nah, she's garbage.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.066
Listen to this message
that Destiny sent me:

08:52.099 --> 08:57.504
"Dearest Charles, when I am done
having my way with you,

08:57.537 --> 09:02.910
our loins will be"--
get this-- "obliterated."

09:04.111 --> 09:05.846
(squeals, shouts)

09:05.880 --> 09:10.450
Oh. Wow, obliterated loins.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.619
-Yes.
-I wouldn't have ever taken you

09:12.652 --> 09:15.055
for the kind of guy
that liked that sort of smut.

09:15.089 --> 09:16.891
Oh, well, Margaret,
let's not confuse smut

09:16.924 --> 09:19.493
with well-written erotica.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.865
And also, look at this one.

09:24.899 --> 09:27.868
She said, she said,
her hands were tired

09:27.902 --> 09:30.404
so her boobies typed this.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.272
Oh, for heaven's sake.

09:32.306 --> 09:34.041
That doesn't even
make any sense.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.310
(laughs)
Well, it makes perfect sense.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.812
It makes perfect sense
to me, too.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.247
Boobies can't type, dum-dums.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.782
Maybe not yours.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.153
Well, anyhoo, I just wanted
to share the good news,

09:46.186 --> 09:49.389
and to thank you for introducing
me to online dating.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.258
You were right, Margaret.
It's fantastic.

09:51.291 --> 09:55.562
Oh, way to go. Way to go,
Charlie. Yay! Ha, ha.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.631
What the hell, Sid?

09:57.664 --> 10:01.836
You created the Destiny profile?

10:01.869 --> 10:03.603
Oh, sounds like
somebody's jealous

10:03.637 --> 10:07.474
that Charlie chose my girl
over your moon nerd.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.276
"Your girl"?

10:09.309 --> 10:11.178
Aren't you getting
a little caught up in this?

10:11.211 --> 10:13.180
I'm not getting
caught up in squat.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.415
It's not like I created
an elaborate backstory

10:15.449 --> 10:18.618
of Destiny's strict
Southern upbringing

10:18.652 --> 10:23.858
as an oil man's only daughter
in rural 1950s Kentucky,

10:23.891 --> 10:28.829
when everybody in town knew
damn well Pappy wanted a boy.

10:33.733 --> 10:36.136
Wow, what a backstory.

10:36.170 --> 10:37.972
Why Kentucky?

10:38.005 --> 10:40.540
-Well, Margaret, in the 19...
-I don't really care!

10:42.009 --> 10:44.378
Remember, we're trying
to help Charlie here,

10:44.411 --> 10:47.915
we are not writing a porno
version of Gone with the Wind.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.986
Well, why can't we do both?

10:52.019 --> 10:54.788
Oh. Sid, promise me
you won't do anything else

10:54.821 --> 10:56.390
without running it by me first.

10:56.423 --> 10:59.193
Oh, Margaret,
I wouldn't dream of it.

10:59.226 --> 11:03.630
* Hank! Hank, Hank, Hank,
Hank, Hank, Hank *

11:03.663 --> 11:07.167
* Jump on it, jump on it,
jump on it... *

11:07.201 --> 11:10.237
I'm in love with a woman
named Destiny.

11:13.007 --> 11:16.176
* Jump on it, jump on it,
jump on it, ow... *

11:21.781 --> 11:23.984
So Hank, you're telling me
that you messaged a woman

11:24.018 --> 11:26.987
named Destiny last night,
and she wrote you back?

11:27.021 --> 11:28.923
Oh, she sure did.

11:28.956 --> 11:32.792
And she typed it-- get this--
with her butt cheeks.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.931
Well, love is in the air.

11:36.964 --> 11:39.499
Sid, let's go play
a little game of pool.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.735
I don't want to play pool
with you. You take my money

11:41.768 --> 11:44.538
and then you poke me
with that stick. Oh!

11:44.571 --> 11:47.674
Why did you message Hank back?

11:47.707 --> 11:50.677
Relax, Margaret,
I'm just having a little fun.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.548
When I'm on Grindr, there's
no romance or witty banter.

11:54.581 --> 11:57.717
It's just,
"Wham, bam, thank you, Sid."

11:58.818 --> 12:00.887
But now,
the conversation is flowing,

12:00.921 --> 12:03.223
the boys are happy.
What is the harm?

12:03.257 --> 12:04.624
Do I really have to say it?

12:04.658 --> 12:06.726
You are catfishing
your two best friends,

12:06.760 --> 12:11.598
posing as a woman who types
with her milkers and her dumper.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.770
-And the problem is?
-(sighs)

12:16.803 --> 12:19.039
You're not gonna be able
to land this plane, Sid.

12:19.073 --> 12:20.874
They're gonna figure it out.

12:20.907 --> 12:25.745
Hey, Hank, what has two thumbs,
11 toes and found a girl online?

12:25.779 --> 12:28.582
-This guy.
-(laughs)

12:28.615 --> 12:31.385
Well, let me hit my contact up
over there at Applebee's...

12:31.418 --> 12:32.786
-Okay.
-...'cause guess what?

12:32.819 --> 12:34.989
Me and you are going out
on a double date!

12:35.022 --> 12:36.423
-Yeah!
-HANK: Ha, ha!

12:36.456 --> 12:38.058
Old Hanky Panky has
narrowed it down

12:38.092 --> 12:41.761
to one very special woman,
and her name is...

12:41.795 --> 12:43.563
Destiny.

12:43.597 --> 12:47.267
I got to go to the barber-- uhp!

12:47.301 --> 12:50.104
My-my sweetie's name
is Destiny, too.

12:50.137 --> 12:53.340
Oh, that's a common name.
End of that conversation.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.642
Uh, anybody like volcanoes?

12:55.675 --> 12:58.578
-Wait a minute,
where's your Destiny from?
-Kentucky.

12:58.612 --> 13:02.516
No volcanoes there, which brings
me back to volcanoes.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.452
Wait a minute,
my Destiny's from Kentucky, too.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.853
Have you met your girl yet?

13:06.886 --> 13:08.455
Not yet.
But we have plans to meet

13:08.488 --> 13:09.956
as soon as she gets back from...

13:09.990 --> 13:12.392
BOTH: ...auditioning
for the Rockettes?

13:13.660 --> 13:16.463
God, I hope
they both make the cut.

13:18.498 --> 13:21.135
(laughs): Or it's gonna be
one awkward night at Applebee's.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.671
Man, we're dating
the same woman, Charlie.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.673
Oh, that's impossible.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.442
I mean, how could
she like us both?

13:28.475 --> 13:31.211
-We're total opposites.
-Well, you got that right.

13:31.245 --> 13:34.448
You're a crusty, burned-out
ex-hippie and I'm DTF.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.051
Dark, tall and fun.

13:37.084 --> 13:40.020
That's not what DTF means.

13:40.054 --> 13:42.689
Fun? You could be
in a personality contest

13:42.722 --> 13:45.559
all by yourself
and come in third.

13:45.592 --> 13:48.995
Stop it, stop it, stop it,
both of you.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.997
You're just horny.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.567
Hank, you said you had lots
of women in your inbox.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.235
Date one of them.

13:55.269 --> 13:57.671
Well, I lied.
Didn't nobody message me back.

13:57.704 --> 14:00.374
I came on too strong
with my dong pics.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.078
Destiny's the only one
who liked my pic.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.579
I'll bet.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.614
Well...

14:11.185 --> 14:13.887
...I've heard enough.
I'm messaging Destiny.

14:13.920 --> 14:17.057
What? No, I'm gonna message
Destiny, right now.

14:17.091 --> 14:20.327
-(phone vibrating)
-Oh! Ooh! Excuse me.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.996
Excuse me,
I got a bad case of the toots.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.598
(laughs, stammers)

14:24.631 --> 14:27.267
Talk about volcanic eruptions.

14:31.805 --> 14:34.208
This is bad.
This is really, really bad.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.009
Uh-oh. I know
what's happening here.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.744
You're feeling guilty

14:37.777 --> 14:40.013
because this was all your idea,
aren't you?

14:40.046 --> 14:42.116
Now you look angry.

14:42.149 --> 14:45.119
But you're angry at yourself.

14:45.152 --> 14:48.054
Ooh, you're angry at me.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.524
Destiny would be happier
with me.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.292
I'm smart, I'm funny.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.928
Stop it, you guys.
You are friends.

14:54.961 --> 14:57.364
Well, Margaret's right.
This ends right here.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.200
-Thank you.
-With a good old-fashioned
fistfight.

15:00.234 --> 15:02.436
-What?
-That is the best idea

15:02.469 --> 15:04.404
you've ever had, you old fart.

15:04.438 --> 15:06.973
-What? You're older than me.
-Yeah, but I'm not a fart.

15:08.442 --> 15:09.976
They're fighting
over me, Margaret.

15:10.009 --> 15:12.812
Ow. You got an elbow
like a praying mantis.

15:12.846 --> 15:14.914
You guys, stop it.
You cannot fight.

15:14.948 --> 15:19.219
Charlie, you need a tool
to help you put your socks on.

15:19.253 --> 15:21.988
Oh, no, we're fighting.
Two hours, dining hall.

15:22.021 --> 15:24.824
Right after Judge Judy
and before Judge Joe Brown.

15:24.858 --> 15:26.960
Okay. See you there.

15:26.993 --> 15:30.430
Can't wait to update
my profile to 28 kills.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.968
-I think they bought it.
-(laughs) Yeah.

15:35.001 --> 15:38.071
And they have no idea
that we know they're Destiny.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.306
Yeah, this'll teach them
not to leave

15:39.339 --> 15:40.674
their laptops laying around.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.108
Do you want to hit them
with one more?

15:42.142 --> 15:45.679
Okay, okay, um...
I hate you, Hank Henderson!

15:45.712 --> 15:48.315
You will rue this day!

15:48.348 --> 15:50.083
Rue this day!

15:50.116 --> 15:53.520
Rue you, bitch!

15:53.553 --> 15:54.988
I'm about to get nose-deep

15:55.021 --> 15:58.158
in Destiny's magical
typing boobies.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.298
This is awful.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.300
They're about to beat the crap
out of each other

16:06.333 --> 16:07.934
and it's all our fault.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.135
What are we gonna do?

16:09.169 --> 16:11.205
The only thing we can do.

16:17.211 --> 16:19.012
Hear me out.

16:25.719 --> 16:28.121
No, Sid. Absolutely no.

16:28.154 --> 16:31.291
-Well, at least
let me explain it.
-Oh, I got it.

16:31.325 --> 16:33.660
You're dressed as Destiny
and now you're gonna go try

16:33.693 --> 16:35.895
and talk the boys
into being friends again.

16:35.929 --> 16:39.065
Okay, it's clear, then.
So what's the holdup?

16:39.098 --> 16:41.868
There is no way in hell that
anybody is ever gonna believe

16:41.901 --> 16:43.303
that you are Destiny.

16:43.337 --> 16:44.871
Look at you.

16:44.904 --> 16:49.709
Well, you haven't even heard
the voice yet.

16:49.743 --> 16:53.347
-(high-pitched voice):
It was...
-No, Sid!

16:53.380 --> 16:56.983
No. You are a 66-year-old
four-foot-ten man

16:57.016 --> 16:59.386
that Hank and Charlie hang out
with every single day.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.920
This is not gonna work.

17:00.954 --> 17:03.156
(scoffs)
What's your idea then?

17:03.189 --> 17:05.158
Just fess up
to the whole damn thing?

17:05.191 --> 17:07.361
Our friends will
hate us forever.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.263
Well, that's why
they can't ever find out.

17:09.296 --> 17:12.766
We're gonna go to that fight,
as us, in our regular clothes,

17:12.799 --> 17:14.701
and we are gonna tell them
how stupid they are acting

17:14.734 --> 17:17.003
over a woman
they've never even met.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.339
Well, fine. But I know my
Destiny would've had them

17:19.373 --> 17:23.843
eating out of the palms
of her tiny, feminine hands.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.212
Why do you even
have this wig, anyway?

17:26.246 --> 17:27.614
Can I live, please?

17:34.454 --> 17:36.390
All right, Sean,
your grandmother tells us

17:36.423 --> 17:37.624
you're a great actor.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.225
Well, I just booked
a dental floss commercial,

17:39.259 --> 17:40.627
so you tell me.

17:40.660 --> 17:41.928
-(chuckles)
-All right.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.763
So here's the deal:
you're gonna come in,

17:43.797 --> 17:45.399
you're gonna arrest us, right?

17:45.432 --> 17:47.567
Scare the hell out
of our friends, they confess,

17:47.601 --> 17:50.537
you get your 50 bucks, and you
get to go home to your wife.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.740
-I don't have a wife.
-That's smart.
Marriage is complicated.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.409
Uhp, here they come.
Places, people.

17:55.442 --> 17:58.645
-(exhales)
-You've got this, Sean!

18:00.514 --> 18:02.716
You don't scare me, Hank.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.618
I ate a man's nose in Nam,

18:04.651 --> 18:07.287
and then I asked him how
he liked the smell of my guts.

18:07.321 --> 18:09.889
Yeah? Back in the day,
I used to have suckers begging

18:09.923 --> 18:12.592
for their mamas,
then I'd bang their mamas.

18:12.626 --> 18:14.761
-You guys, stop!
-Never!

18:14.794 --> 18:16.663
Oh, well, we tried.
I'll go get the wig.

18:16.696 --> 18:19.766
(chanting):
Fight! Fight! Fight!

18:19.799 --> 18:21.601
Maybe we should
just let them go.

18:21.635 --> 18:24.471
I mean, they're old men,
how bad could it be?

18:24.504 --> 18:26.272
You made the classic blunder.

18:26.306 --> 18:29.242
You brought a fist
to a knife fight.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.677
(people gasping)

18:30.710 --> 18:32.646
Break it up, you two!

18:32.679 --> 18:35.949
We've got a 1099 in progress.
That's right.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.918
Two old guys fighting
over a woman. That's right.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.521
Put me through
to the commissioner.

18:41.555 --> 18:44.458
They're putting him through
to the commissioner, Margaret.

18:44.491 --> 18:47.126
We'll be jailed for cybercrimes.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.862
Calm down, Sid.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.830
No, th-they'll put me
in the big house.

18:50.864 --> 18:52.766
Look at me,
I'll get eaten alive.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.369
You'll be fine.

18:55.402 --> 18:57.971
That's right,
you're both under arrest.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.873
For illegal knife-fighting.

18:59.906 --> 19:03.042
I'm gonna power this taser
up to a thousand volts.

19:03.076 --> 19:04.978
That's right.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.846
The highest amount of volts.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.383
No, no, no! No, no, no,
you'll kill them!

19:09.416 --> 19:11.351
No, it was me!
I did it, I'm Destiny!

19:12.519 --> 19:14.287
I never meant to hurt y'all.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.724
We were just trying to help,
but we-we got carried away.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.225
Tell them, Margaret.
Tell them that we did it.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.695
They know
that we're Destiny, Sid.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.630
They're just messing with us.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.298
SID:
What?

19:25.331 --> 19:29.268
I'm more confused than the night
I conceived my son.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.507
This cop, he's a fake.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.709
And a really bad actor,
by the way.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.444
Um, wow.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.747
(imitating Sean):
That's right.

19:46.386 --> 19:50.023
(normal voice:) You called in
a 1099. That's a tax form.

19:50.056 --> 19:53.026
See this walkie-talkie here?
Fake.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.594
It's not hooked up to anything.

19:54.628 --> 19:57.363
His little taser here? Fake.

19:57.397 --> 20:00.366
See? This knife here? Fake.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.668
HANK AND CHARLIE:
No, no, no, no, no!

20:01.701 --> 20:04.003
-(screams)
-No, no...

20:04.037 --> 20:07.206
You got the first two right,
but the knife is real.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.175
-Oh!
-That's right.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.077
Ow...

20:15.815 --> 20:17.417
So then we found Sid's computer
open, and we figured

20:17.451 --> 20:19.118
we'd teach y'all a lesson
about messing with your friends.

20:19.152 --> 20:21.555
Well, it worked. I'd already
picked out my prison name.

20:21.588 --> 20:25.759
I settled on Buzzsaw.

20:28.294 --> 20:31.598
I figured I'd be working
with a lot of wood.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.571
Well, I'm just sorry
things got so out of hand.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.939
We didn't want you to give up
on love, Charlie.

20:39.973 --> 20:42.542
There's still
somebody out there for you.

20:42.576 --> 20:45.912
And Hank, well...

20:50.817 --> 20:52.919
You trailed off there.

20:52.952 --> 20:56.289
I did, didn't I?

20:56.322 --> 20:57.757
Well, it was a wild ride,

20:57.791 --> 21:00.226
but the good news is
nobody got hurt.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.028
Is someone gonna drive me
to the hospital?

21:03.497 --> 21:06.232
Oh. Well, I am the one
that stabbed him, so I suppose

21:06.265 --> 21:09.569
I should do the right thing
and call him an Uber.

21:09.603 --> 21:13.473
Don't worry, Sean,
we'll, uh, pay you double.

21:13.507 --> 21:15.241
-A hundred bucks.
-A hundred bucks?

21:15.274 --> 21:18.311
It's not like he got shot.

21:18.344 --> 21:21.948
Seven minutes, Sean.
It's a blue hatchback.

21:23.517 --> 21:25.018
That's pretty good.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.859
You've made the cut
with The Cool Kids.
