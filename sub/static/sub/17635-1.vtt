01:56.671 --> 01:59.807
Attention, flight "a"!
Flight "a"!

01:59.875 --> 02:05.864
Japanese aircraft sighted
over Kunsing area.

02:59.782 --> 03:02.183
Aggie blue from Aggie blue one.
Go ahead.

03:04.253 --> 03:07.524
- Blue two okay, skipper.
- Blue three, check.

03:07.595 --> 03:10.347
Blue four
receiving you r5-s5, sir.

03:10.415 --> 03:14.969
- Blue five, okay.
- Blue six, okay.

05:11.245 --> 05:16.322
Eighteen attack bombers, three
points to your right. Altitude about 15,000.

05:16.389 --> 05:20.642
What do you know, only three to
one. That won't even wake me up.

05:21.795 --> 05:24.529
- Gordon to dale, over.
- Go ahead, sir.

05:24.597 --> 05:26.533
Listen, dale,
this is your first time up.

05:26.601 --> 05:28.501
Don't try to win this war
all by yourself.

05:28.569 --> 05:31.204
- Stick close. Tail them in formation.
- Yes, sir.

09:42.270 --> 09:44.205
What time is it?

09:44.273 --> 09:48.432
-11:27.
- Look like those boozers are overdue.

10:34.670 --> 10:38.295
- All safe and accounted for?
- Of course.

10:38.363 --> 10:40.730
Of course.

11:30.744 --> 11:34.164
Look, captain Jim!
Looky! Wham, wham!

11:34.231 --> 11:36.232
Termites.

11:59.980 --> 12:03.216
Better get a new oxygen tank.
She only registers 500.

12:03.283 --> 12:05.285
Hap.

12:08.123 --> 12:10.223
- You got something on your mind?
- Me?

12:10.291 --> 12:12.408
Nothing but japs.
Why?

12:12.476 --> 12:16.062
- You're not pulling out of your
dives fast enough. - Oh?

12:16.130 --> 12:18.104
I'll watch it.

12:18.121 --> 12:21.257
- It only takes one.
- I know, Jim.

12:21.325 --> 12:24.911
Hate to look around one day and find out
you're the little man who wasn't there.

12:24.979 --> 12:28.931
You and Reardon better go up this
afternoon and simulate diving attack.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.900
Mustn't get rusty.

12:30.968 --> 12:33.402
Okay, Jim.

12:33.470 --> 12:37.756
A little rough in spots, Dale, but I
think when you iron a few things out-

12:37.824 --> 12:40.493
Dale?

12:44.019 --> 12:45.988
Dale?

12:59.720 --> 13:02.705
Bill, take care of Dale.

13:11.855 --> 13:13.806
Mike?

13:13.873 --> 13:16.475
Yes, sir? Did that box of
instruments come up from Rangoon?

13:16.543 --> 13:19.044
Yes, sir.
Fix the panel in Dale's ship.

13:40.089 --> 13:42.591
This belonged to Dale too.

13:57.040 --> 14:00.115
Come in.

14:20.469 --> 14:22.437
Quite a collection.

14:27.049 --> 14:30.351
He should have stayed
in college where he came from,

14:30.419 --> 14:33.087
but he begged for a chance.

14:33.155 --> 14:36.742
Begged for it like some kid
asking to go to the circus,

14:36.810 --> 14:38.777
and I gave it to him.

14:38.845 --> 14:41.080
What happened?

14:41.148 --> 14:45.751
He didn't watch his tail.
And outnumbered, as usual.

14:45.819 --> 14:48.426
He did bring
his ship back.

14:48.494 --> 14:52.213
Yeah... He did.

14:53.465 --> 14:55.416
But tomorrow
or the next day,

14:55.484 --> 14:57.385
there will be
somebody else in it...

14:57.453 --> 14:59.404
With three of them
on his tail.

14:59.455 --> 15:01.990
- Or six or ten
- Jim.

15:03.342 --> 15:06.478
- How's Miller?
- Just a flesh wound in the shoulder.

15:06.546 --> 15:09.164
I'll give him back
to you in a week.

15:09.231 --> 15:11.182
How are you?

15:11.250 --> 15:13.841
You can have me
back anytime.

15:18.630 --> 15:20.564
Why don't you go home?

15:20.632 --> 15:22.967
You need a nurse.

15:23.035 --> 15:26.621
Suppose you
cut yourself shaving?

15:26.689 --> 15:29.157
When did you sleep last?

15:29.225 --> 15:32.193
Monday. It was
a very good day for it.

15:32.261 --> 15:35.647
Well, try thursdays. They're
good days too. Excuse me.

15:35.715 --> 15:37.653
Larry?

15:37.723 --> 15:40.991
Get me the weather on M5,
and check on those oil drums.

15:41.059 --> 15:45.830
Find out what's holding them up.
As if I didn't already know.

15:45.897 --> 15:49.550
- Think Hap could run this show
for a couple of days? - Yes. Why?

15:49.618 --> 15:53.671
I've got to run down to Rangoon. The
colonel promised me some replacements.

15:53.739 --> 15:57.191
- I'm gonna need them now that Dale..
- When will you be back?

15:57.258 --> 15:59.861
Oh, I don't know.

15:59.928 --> 16:03.854
Might keep right on going
till I get to San Francisco.

16:03.905 --> 16:06.840
Nice town, San Francisco.

16:06.907 --> 16:08.909
Yeah.

16:09.944 --> 16:13.330
There's a place
on Fisherman's Wharf-

16:13.398 --> 16:16.200
They serve oysters
you have to cut with a knife.

16:16.268 --> 16:18.536
Ever try Simpsons
in London?

16:18.604 --> 16:21.689
Roast beef
you can cut with a fork.

16:21.757 --> 16:23.875
No floor show though.

16:23.926 --> 16:26.010
No floor show.

16:26.078 --> 16:28.152
Take me with you.

16:28.220 --> 16:32.039
No, Brooke, we can't
do anything like that.

16:32.106 --> 16:35.559
I know. I couldn't
leave anyway.

16:35.627 --> 16:38.596
There's a new batch of evacuee
children coming this afternoon.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.231
Wanted
to see me, Jim?

16:41.299 --> 16:43.234
Yeah, I want you to take care
of the store while I'm away.

16:43.302 --> 16:45.235
- Got to go to Rangoon.
- Sure.

16:45.303 --> 16:47.905
Larry, have the station wagon brought
around and put my things in it.

16:47.973 --> 16:49.924
Got to catch a plane
for Rangoon.

16:49.991 --> 16:53.082
Did that gasoline shipment
arrive yet?

16:53.150 --> 16:56.603
I wish somebody would figure out
a ship that would fly on rice.

16:56.670 --> 16:58.739
Want to check
the scoreboard?

16:58.806 --> 17:01.241
Mccurdy will fly number two
while you're in charge.

17:01.308 --> 17:03.944
Make sure that second-string
pitcher does some work on his guns.

17:04.012 --> 17:09.450
Jim: Zero. Hap: Zero
Hap: Two

17:09.518 --> 17:11.618
I thought you and Jim-

17:11.685 --> 17:14.122
Didn't I tell you to credit
my ship only to Dale?

17:14.189 --> 17:17.107
Look, Jim, I got nobody back in the states.

17:17.175 --> 17:21.268
I thought Dale's folks would find that
$1,000 bonus handy around the farm.

17:21.335 --> 17:23.436
Or is it
a gas station?

17:23.505 --> 17:26.106
You got your halo
on crooked, pal.

17:26.174 --> 17:28.223
- Car's ready.
- Right.

17:28.291 --> 17:31.278
Start working on Selby
and Mcintosh as a team.

17:31.345 --> 17:33.296
- I think they're about ready.
- Okay, Jim.

17:33.348 --> 17:35.799
Don't worry about a thing. I'll take
care of things while you're away.

17:35.850 --> 17:39.153
Okay. And no gin rummy with Brooke.

17:39.220 --> 17:43.863
- She's my pigeon. Bye, pigeon.
- Good-bye.

18:00.065 --> 18:03.166
What do you see
in that guy?

18:03.234 --> 18:05.502
San Francisco.

18:05.570 --> 18:07.709
Huh?

18:07.727 --> 18:10.564
never mind.

18:28.082 --> 18:30.133
Any more on flight 8
from Hong Kong?

18:30.201 --> 18:33.392
The airport informs me the plane has
been delayed. The storm, you know.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.695
Oh, there were two
gentlemen here expecting me.

18:35.762 --> 18:37.713
I believe
they just came in.

18:37.764 --> 18:40.366
You'll find them in the
cocktail lounge with mrs. Bales.

18:40.434 --> 18:42.551
Mrs. Bales?

18:42.619 --> 18:46.823
- If anything more comes in on
that plane, let me know. - Yes, sir.

18:57.301 --> 19:00.076
Squadron leader Gordon, I'm
lieutenant Barton. How are you?

19:00.144 --> 19:03.596
- Hello, Blackie.
- Hello, Jim. My wife, Jim.

19:03.663 --> 19:05.565
How do you do?

19:05.633 --> 19:07.900
What are you
doing here, Blackie?

19:07.968 --> 19:10.737
I heard you needed pilots,
and I needed the job.

19:10.804 --> 19:12.972
I didn't know at the time
that you were head man.

19:17.494 --> 19:19.429
I'll run upstairs and pack.

19:19.497 --> 19:22.265
- Excuse me. - Train leaves for
Lai Chau at 6:00 in the morning.

19:22.332 --> 19:24.340
- Be on it.
- Yes, sir.

19:26.676 --> 19:28.960
She knows, jim.

19:29.028 --> 19:32.281
I hate to turn you down, Blackie
but I've got to.

19:32.348 --> 19:34.950
Look, Jim, I don't want to
put this on a personal basis,

19:35.019 --> 19:37.453
But you know me,
you know my work.

19:37.521 --> 19:40.290
- I'm a good flier, Jim.
- I know you are.

19:40.341 --> 19:44.294
You could work for me
anytime. We get along, but-

19:44.362 --> 19:48.921
I haven't been on that stuff for a long
time, Jim. Honest. That's just soda pop.

19:48.988 --> 19:52.141
It isn't that. I'm trying to
hold on to a fine bunch of men.

19:52.209 --> 19:54.977
It isn't always easy
to keep peace in the family.

19:55.045 --> 19:57.780
Some of them would remember
that Lefty Matson case.

19:57.831 --> 20:01.650
- But, Jim, I was cleared of that.
- I know.

20:01.718 --> 20:04.320
The army gave you
a clean bill of health,

20:04.388 --> 20:08.407
But you'd be flying with a
lot of men that knew Lefty.

20:08.508 --> 20:11.177
I'm really doing Blackie
a favor, mrs. Bales.

20:11.244 --> 20:15.337
I don't want any favors. I just
want a chance to get back on my feet again.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.922
This is the last outpost
for me, Jim.

20:17.990 --> 20:22.177
Oh, it just wouldn't work out. I'm sorry.

20:22.245 --> 20:24.580
Good-bye, mrs. Bales,
Blackie.

20:36.410 --> 20:39.285
<i>Any news yet? No, sir. Not yet.</i>

20:41.254 --> 20:44.873
Oh Mr. Gordon, I made some
excuse so I could talk to you.

20:44.941 --> 20:48.210
No matter what happens, please
don't ever tell Blackie that I did.

20:48.277 --> 20:50.279
Of course.

20:56.803 --> 20:59.405
Mr. Gordon, I hate
to butt in like this,

20:59.473 --> 21:02.074
But you've got to give him
another chance to fly.

21:02.141 --> 21:05.400
Mrs. Bales, I can't jeopardize
the morale of an entire squadron...

21:05.468 --> 21:07.401
Just to give
your husband a job.

21:07.469 --> 21:12.974
But it isn't just a job. Though we
need the money, it's something more.

21:13.041 --> 21:18.564
I married him right after
that happened.

21:18.632 --> 21:20.750
He told me the whole story.

21:20.817 --> 21:25.254
I thought I could
make it up to him, but I can't.

21:25.322 --> 21:29.615
There's some things that even a
wife can't do for the man she loves.

21:29.682 --> 21:32.267
He's got to find it
himself...

21:32.334 --> 21:34.286
Doing the things
he loves best,

21:34.354 --> 21:37.605
Even if means
paying with his life.

21:37.673 --> 21:41.560
It isn't easy for me to say no. You
don't know what you're asking me to do.

21:41.611 --> 21:44.112
Oh, I do.

21:44.179 --> 21:48.967
Do you know what losing
your self-respect means?

21:49.034 --> 21:51.570
That's what's happened to him.

21:51.621 --> 21:55.129
I know.
I live with him.

21:55.196 --> 21:58.983
I've caught him looking out
of a window, watching a plane.

21:59.050 --> 22:02.136
Watching it till
he couldn't see it any more.

22:02.204 --> 22:05.039
Afraid to turn around
and look me in the face.

22:05.107 --> 22:10.629
- Mrs. Bales... - Mr. Gordon, you know men.
You command a squadron.

22:10.697 --> 22:14.549
You've seen them die.
Some of them go out smiling.

22:14.617 --> 22:17.486
Have you ever seen the look
on a man's face...

22:17.554 --> 22:19.860
When you tell him
he can't fly anymore?

22:21.080 --> 22:23.147
No.

22:23.215 --> 22:26.834
It's a living death,
mr. Gordon. I know.

22:26.902 --> 22:28.853
Please don't say any more.

22:28.921 --> 22:32.273
I'd rather he went with you
and took what came...

22:32.341 --> 22:35.660
Than to live with him
the rest of his life...

22:35.728 --> 22:40.414
Watching him
die a little every day.

22:45.026 --> 22:48.245
Have him on that train
tomorrow morning.

22:50.264 --> 22:52.366
Thanks.

22:53.518 --> 22:55.454
You can't go with him,
you know.

22:55.521 --> 22:58.523
Yes, I know.

22:58.624 --> 23:02.077
And please don't ever
tell Blackie I spoke to you.

23:05.180 --> 23:07.720
I just received news for that
plane from Hong Kong, sir.

23:07.788 --> 23:10.390
It was attacked and fired upon by a
japanese fighter squadron.

23:10.458 --> 23:13.043
- Is it down? - No, sir. It's coming in
on one wing and a prayer.

23:13.111 --> 23:15.295
- Get me a cab.
- Yes, sir.

23:45.985 --> 23:49.370
Rangoon calling again, Woody.

23:49.437 --> 23:52.607
Jason, flight 8. Go ahead,
Rangoon. What do you want now?

23:52.674 --> 23:55.927
Am I gonna bring the
plane in? No, you dope!

23:55.995 --> 23:59.419
I'm gonna park it up here on the clouds
and wait till the storm blows over!

24:01.239 --> 24:03.607
We did everything
to cover your landing, Jason.

24:03.708 --> 24:05.776
Fire and crash trucks
are standing by.

24:05.844 --> 24:08.512
- Bring her down easy.
- "easy"?

24:13.284 --> 24:18.088
Rangoon calling Jason, flight 8.
What's your position?

24:18.156 --> 24:20.056
My instruments tell me
I'm flying upside-down...

24:20.124 --> 24:22.176
5,000 feet
below Lake Michigan.

24:22.244 --> 24:24.884
But I must be wrong because I
can see the lights of the field.

24:24.935 --> 24:26.887
Head for cover.
I'm coming in!

24:28.572 --> 24:30.907
I can't see them,
mr. Raffkin.

24:30.974 --> 24:32.876
Bring that mike
outside.

24:45.423 --> 24:48.598
Lower the landing gear,
Alabama.

25:04.031 --> 25:06.533
If he walks away from this,
he's a miracle man.

25:11.121 --> 25:13.696
Pull up, Woody!
You're coming in on one wheel!

25:21.272 --> 25:26.410
- thanks.
- Woody, this is Jim Gordon.

25:26.478 --> 25:30.614
- Jim? What are you doing up so late, pappy?
- Never mind that.

25:30.682 --> 25:33.050
The runway at the north end
of the field is mud and water.

25:33.117 --> 25:37.539
Your only chance is to get that wheel up and
skid in on your belly, but watch the wind.

25:37.607 --> 25:39.912
Stop worrying, pappy. Just
get that mob out of the way...

25:39.980 --> 25:42.415
Or somebody will get a
hot engine in their lap.

25:42.483 --> 25:45.151
Pull up
that landing gear.

26:09.349 --> 26:12.251
You're gonna spill, Woody!
You're coming in crosswind!

26:48.545 --> 26:51.931
Mm-mmm.
Good ol' real estate!

26:53.389 --> 26:55.640
- Jim! - Woody! -
What do you say, pappy?

26:55.692 --> 26:57.659
Nice landing.

26:57.727 --> 26:59.678
- Did you like it?
- Why, you lucky-

26:59.746 --> 27:02.498
- What do you mean, "lucky"?
- Coming in crosswind.

27:02.565 --> 27:05.701
Why not? I wanted the wind to
blow the fire away from the cabin.

27:05.769 --> 27:08.204
Meet my better half while he's
still awake. This is Alabama Smith.

27:08.272 --> 27:10.506
- This is captain Jim Gordon of
the Flying Tigers. - How are you?

27:10.574 --> 27:13.009
<i>That's enough. Jason, that was magnificent!</i>

27:13.077 --> 27:15.511
Save it. I'm gonna find
a promotion for you.

27:15.579 --> 27:19.204
Listen, you can take my job, the
Rangoon Airways, the Burmese...

27:19.272 --> 27:22.440
and the rest of this cockeyed country
and give it back to Marco Polo!

27:22.508 --> 27:25.794
- Chop, chop.
- But mr. Jason-

27:27.931 --> 27:30.899
I didn't sign on to be a target
for a bunch of four-eyed japs!

27:30.967 --> 27:34.887
- You're not resigning?
- No, I'm quitting, definitely and for good.

27:34.954 --> 27:37.222
And me too.

27:37.290 --> 27:40.542
And forward mr. Jason's mail
to Kunsing airfield.

27:40.610 --> 27:42.613
Thank you very much,
mr. Raffkin.

27:46.639 --> 27:49.140
Here comes the replacements.

28:11.337 --> 28:13.272
Take these men
over to barracks.

28:13.339 --> 28:16.107
- What's this thing?
- Headquarters.

28:16.175 --> 28:18.443
It looks like the Taj
Mahal with a hangover.

28:18.511 --> 28:20.462
What's that?
The milk bar?

28:22.782 --> 28:25.800
No, the barracks. Pick out a cot
with four legs if you can find one.

28:25.868 --> 28:28.470
Dump your stuff and report
back to me at the hangar.

28:28.538 --> 28:30.505
What hangar?

28:34.950 --> 28:38.803
That's a hangar? I like the
green roof, but isn't it drafty?

28:38.870 --> 28:41.306
I didn't promise you
La Guardia airport.

28:41.373 --> 28:43.491
Look, pappy,
if I'd have known this,

28:43.559 --> 28:46.161
I wouldn't have come
out here for $612 a month.

28:46.213 --> 28:48.497
How did you get mixed up
in this anyway?

28:48.565 --> 28:51.650
- You never used to like chop suey.
- You'll find out.

28:51.718 --> 28:54.886
Get yourself all set,
and I'll see you later.

28:57.390 --> 28:59.881
Okay, pappy.

29:01.733 --> 29:05.520
Say! What are those things you wear
on your backs, laundry tickets?

29:05.571 --> 29:08.023
No, in case you're forced down
in chinese territory,

29:08.074 --> 29:10.024
They'll know you're
an american volunteer.

29:10.092 --> 29:12.327
What if you're forced down
in enemy territory?

29:12.395 --> 29:14.729
Then you've got
nothing to worry about.

29:21.253 --> 29:24.345
- You all set, Woody?
- Well. the red carpet's a little threadbare,

29:24.412 --> 29:26.363
The brass band's
a little out of tune,

29:26.431 --> 29:28.365
But outside of that,
I'm all set.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.867
Would you like the blue
or the pink bridal suite, sir?

29:30.935 --> 29:33.704
The blue comes
with a sunken tub.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.808
What did you expect,
the La Guardia airport?

29:36.860 --> 29:39.461
Huh?

29:43.116 --> 29:45.200
Drop this off for me,
will you?

29:45.267 --> 29:47.436
I've got to make
a reconnaissance.

29:50.312 --> 29:53.297
I'm getting that old feeling.

30:04.143 --> 30:06.577
Jim, is that you?

30:06.645 --> 30:08.646
I won't be a minute.

30:10.982 --> 30:14.808
I'm just finishing a bath.
Be right out.

30:16.978 --> 30:20.930
How is Rangoon?
Did you have fun?

30:20.998 --> 30:24.168
How many replacements
did you bring back?

30:26.838 --> 30:30.358
You would come back just
when I was stealing a bath.

30:30.426 --> 30:33.945
Then, of course, the boiler
went burst and the water ran out-

30:34.013 --> 30:36.447
Oh, hello.

30:36.515 --> 30:39.673
- Jim Gordon with you?
- Won't I do?

30:42.010 --> 30:44.945
Say, tell me something.
You always use Jim's tub?

30:45.013 --> 30:48.632
- Yes, we all do.
- Cozy.

30:48.700 --> 30:51.268
It happens to be the only
bathtub in Kunsing.

30:51.336 --> 30:54.205
I see. It must be a very
chummy spot on Saturday night.

30:56.040 --> 30:58.609
Do you sing and dance too or
is your act limited to patter?

30:58.677 --> 31:02.096
Oh, fine, fine.

31:02.164 --> 31:04.971
You're one of the new
replacements, aren't you?

31:05.039 --> 31:06.974
Oh, no, not one
of the replacements.

31:07.041 --> 31:08.992
Jim told me he was having
a little trouble out here,

31:09.060 --> 31:10.993
So I thought
I'd give him a hand.

31:11.061 --> 31:13.630
And I think
I'm going to like it.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.485
I'm so glad.

31:17.553 --> 31:20.771
If there's anything we can do to make you
comfortable, don't hesitate to call on us.

31:20.839 --> 31:24.175
Oh, I will, I will.
How about dinner?

31:24.243 --> 31:26.343
Sorry.

31:26.411 --> 31:29.386
I never get
quite that hungry.

31:32.774 --> 31:36.860
Oh, and if you should use the tub,
you'll be sure and empty it, won't you?

31:36.927 --> 31:40.080
We've no plumbing.
So sorry.

31:49.590 --> 31:52.359
- What happened to that one?
- I overshot the field yesterday.

31:52.427 --> 31:55.034
Came in a little too high,
I guess.

31:55.102 --> 31:57.737
- I'll watch it.
- Jim!

31:57.805 --> 32:00.406
- Brooke! Been behaving yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

32:00.474 --> 32:03.209
No, she hasn't. She's been taking
me at gin rummy since you left.

32:03.277 --> 32:05.212
Oh, Woody.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.915
- Miss Elliott, mr. Jason.
- We've met.

32:07.983 --> 32:10.250
What do you think
of glamour boy?

32:10.318 --> 32:13.087
He's a difficult man
to get to know. So shy.

32:13.155 --> 32:15.756
Anybody in my spot would
have done the same thing.

32:15.807 --> 32:18.098
Hap Davis,
Woody Jason.

32:18.166 --> 32:20.266
- Glad to have you with us, Jason.
- Thank you, Hap.

32:20.334 --> 32:22.235
I'm gonna put him
in your hands, Hap.

32:22.303 --> 32:25.271
I don't need a nurse.
I've already got one.

32:25.339 --> 32:28.692
- If you'll excuse me, I have to go on duty.
- Won't you wish me luck?

32:28.759 --> 32:31.861
You don't really need it,
do you?

32:35.999 --> 32:39.586
- Did I do something wrong?
- Do you ever do anything right?

32:39.653 --> 32:42.089
Pappy, why don't you
stop picking on me?

32:42.156 --> 32:44.997
Come on. I'll introduce you
to the rest of the fellas.

32:46.683 --> 32:49.768
I don't like to point, chum, but
she happens to be the skipper's girl.

32:49.836 --> 32:52.805
- Great. She's got a sense of humor,
hasn't she? - We all have.

32:52.873 --> 32:57.026
In fact, we wake up two or three times
a night, laugh and go back to sleep.

32:59.530 --> 33:03.350
I would have hated to have been in that
burning plane with anybody else but Woody.

33:03.401 --> 33:06.135
You don't have to sell Jason to
us. We know he's got a good record.

33:06.203 --> 33:09.445
But out here,
everybody starts even.

33:09.513 --> 33:11.447
Oh, yeah.

33:11.515 --> 33:14.550
Does that go
for me too?

33:16.720 --> 33:19.222
Sure.
Sure, it does.

33:21.558 --> 33:23.893
Thanks, fellas.
Thanks.

33:24.878 --> 33:26.829
- Selby.
- Yeah?

33:26.897 --> 33:29.499
- I got your 30 pasted together.
- Okay.

33:29.566 --> 33:33.509
We're not sticklers for discipline
here, Woody, but we expect results.

33:33.576 --> 33:35.527
Relax.

33:35.595 --> 33:38.364
- Gentlemen, this is Woody Jason.
- Hi, fellas.

33:38.415 --> 33:40.532
- Hi, Woody.
- His bark is worse than his bite.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.501
Shake hands
and count your fingers.

33:42.569 --> 33:44.836
- I'm Mccurdy from Brooklyn.
- How are you, Brooklyn?

33:44.904 --> 33:47.507
You ever know a little girl
by the name of Sally Eray?

33:47.575 --> 33:49.526
No, you wouldn't.
You're not her type.

33:49.593 --> 33:51.527
- My name's Norton. I'm from
- Don't tell me. I know.

33:51.595 --> 33:54.531
A state of beautiful women. You ever
know the Mcdott sisters from Fort Worth?

33:54.598 --> 33:56.999
- I'm from Dallas.
- Oh.

33:57.067 --> 33:59.675
Reardon, Maine. I don't think
you'd know anybody I'd know.

33:59.726 --> 34:02.528
now, there's where you're wrong. I
knew a redheaded girl by the name-

34:02.596 --> 34:05.030
Selby, Michigan. Selby mi-

34:05.098 --> 34:08.551
Hello, Michigan.
What a football team.

34:08.618 --> 34:12.020
- I used to date a little... what
do you call those? - Majorette.

34:12.088 --> 34:14.223
Yeah, a majorette.

34:14.291 --> 34:16.958
What a football team.

34:17.025 --> 34:19.061
- My name's Mcintosh.
- How are you, Mac?

34:19.129 --> 34:21.196
I come from nowhere.
You got a girl there?

34:21.264 --> 34:24.072
Uh-
Bentley's that gal's name.

34:24.139 --> 34:27.726
A tall brunette with a p-40
figure and plenty of armor.

34:27.793 --> 34:31.245
- Boy, I can't wait till I get back.
- "Back"?

34:31.313 --> 34:35.101
Yeah, you don't think I'm gonna
make this my life's work, do you?

34:39.188 --> 34:42.742
Give him time, boys.
He'll catch there's a war on.

34:42.810 --> 34:46.428
I know there's a war, but you
fellows have no part of it.

34:46.496 --> 34:48.570
We're all out here for the same reason.
Dough.

34:48.638 --> 34:52.239
Sure, that we are, but it's good
to know every check you cash in...

34:52.292 --> 34:54.243
means a jap's
cashed in too.

34:54.310 --> 34:57.429
Wait a minute, fellas. We're
all making the same salary:

34:57.497 --> 35:00.265
600 bucks a month
and 500 a jap, right?

35:00.333 --> 35:04.453
Back home most of us would kill rattlesnakes
whether there was a bounty on them or not.

35:04.521 --> 35:06.955
I know, but you're protecting your
own home. This is not our home.

35:07.023 --> 35:11.159
It's not our fight. It's a business.
And boy I hope business is good.

35:23.229 --> 35:26.982
- What's the matter with him?
- His brother crashed behind enemy lines.

35:27.050 --> 35:29.151
We found him after the japs
got through with him.

35:29.219 --> 35:33.072
- I didn't mean anything personal
- We know you didn't, Woody.

35:33.140 --> 35:35.040
- Let's take a walk.
- Yeah, but-

35:35.108 --> 35:37.881
Get down!

36:12.107 --> 36:15.260
- Tails up!
- Let's go.

36:16.445 --> 36:18.880
- Come on, Alabama!
- Where are we going?

36:18.948 --> 36:21.349
The bank's open!

36:28.214 --> 36:30.381
- Is anybody hurt?
- Not yet.

36:30.449 --> 36:33.585
- Which one do I take? - Are you crazy?
Wait till you get combat training.

36:33.636 --> 36:35.920
"Training"? Me?
I'm losing dough!

36:35.988 --> 36:38.490
And I'm running this outfit! Get back!

37:17.119 --> 37:20.811
1,500 smackers up there,
and that guy cuts me off!

37:20.879 --> 37:23.864
- There's a shelter at the first aid.
- What are we waiting for?

37:23.932 --> 37:26.700
I don't know,
but I came out here to fly.

37:32.006 --> 37:34.275
Hey, Woody!
That ain't the way!

37:39.381 --> 37:41.949
Stop, stop!

37:46.360 --> 37:49.563
No! No!
Come back here!

37:54.135 --> 37:57.338
- Smart fellow taking plane. No bullets!
- No ammunition?

37:57.405 --> 37:58.940
what?
No got-

37:59.007 --> 38:02.243
- Contact him by radio.
- Him no take earphone.

38:02.310 --> 38:04.912
- Let's contact Jim!
- Yeah!

38:37.391 --> 38:39.893
Aggie dispersal calling
aggie blue one, Gordon.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.646
- Aggie dispersal calling aggie
blue one, Gordon. Go ahead.

38:42.713 --> 38:45.382
Aggie blue one, Gordon, back
to Aggie dispersal. Go ahead.

38:45.450 --> 38:48.586
Hello, Gordon. Wingman
Jason took off in p-40 ship.

38:48.654 --> 38:50.554
He's unarmed and without
radio communication.

38:50.622 --> 38:53.758
Request you locate and signal him to
return to base immediately. Go ahead.

38:53.809 --> 38:55.826
Okay!

39:31.792 --> 39:33.509
Get your checkbook out, general.

41:21.278 --> 41:25.982
Woody! Woody! Woody!

41:32.462 --> 41:34.930
Woody, are you all right?

41:34.997 --> 41:38.483
Oh, I'm all right.

41:51.198 --> 41:53.221
Well, I walked away
from that one.

41:53.289 --> 41:55.723
Hey, whose side
are you on?

41:55.791 --> 41:58.376
Report to my office
immediately.

41:59.545 --> 42:01.713
Okay, pappy.

42:04.450 --> 42:08.237
A few more landings like that,
and he'll be a japanese ace.

42:09.872 --> 42:12.641
Where do you think you are, with
some broken-down flying circus?

42:12.743 --> 42:16.162
It would have been a cinch. I was riding
the murder spot right above those japolas.

42:16.230 --> 42:18.353
If I had ammunition, I'd have
blown them clear out of China.

42:18.404 --> 42:20.355
And you washed out
a good ship.

42:20.422 --> 42:22.491
You talk like that crate
is more important than me.

42:22.558 --> 42:24.993
I can't afford to lose
either planes or pilots.

42:25.060 --> 42:27.162
Pappy, it's like I told you
down at the barracks:

42:27.230 --> 42:30.698
All I get out of this is the dough,
so you can't blame me for trying.

42:30.766 --> 42:33.368
In a skeet match, the guy who knocks
down the most pigeons wins the cup.

42:33.419 --> 42:36.355
I can't have grandstanders
trying to hog the whole show.

42:36.422 --> 42:39.674
Results here are based on
cooperation and understanding.

42:39.742 --> 42:42.027
Discipline in the air is strict
because that's the only way...

42:42.095 --> 42:44.435
an outfit like this
can operate.

42:45.787 --> 42:49.373
- Wait, Hap.
- All right, I'll admit I was wrong.

42:49.441 --> 42:51.543
I made a mistake.

42:51.610 --> 42:54.211
Okay.

42:54.279 --> 42:58.617
In this kind of warfare, a fella likes to
feel he's flying with somebody he can trust.

42:58.684 --> 43:03.238
- What do I care? It's every man for himself,
isn't it? - Not these days.

43:03.306 --> 43:06.258
Wait till you look back and see
a jap sitting on your tail...

43:06.326 --> 43:09.333
In a ship
that you can't outmaneuver.

43:09.401 --> 43:11.570
- Then you'll know what I'm talking about.
- Okay, pappy.

43:11.637 --> 43:14.238
From now on, I'll study my lessons
and practice the piano every day.

43:14.306 --> 43:16.241
There won't be
any more trouble.

43:16.309 --> 43:20.061
I'll be a modest, respectful
soldier if it kills me, I swear.

43:20.128 --> 43:22.564
Okay, Woody.

43:22.631 --> 43:25.499
You got a cigarette?

43:28.337 --> 43:30.504
- Keep them.
- Thanks.

43:32.474 --> 43:34.498
You got a match?

43:44.676 --> 43:47.762
Afraid you're gonna have a little
trouble with that ball of fire, skipper.

43:47.864 --> 43:49.931
Oh, Woody's all right.

43:49.998 --> 43:52.434
Gets a little off beam
once in a while,

43:52.501 --> 43:54.902
But he's gonna develop into
the best flier in this squadron.

43:54.970 --> 43:56.955
That's what counts.

43:57.023 --> 44:00.647
You see how he went after those
three japs? That took nerve!

44:00.715 --> 44:04.034
Yeah, he's got nerve,
all right.

44:06.205 --> 44:08.539
Got a cigarette?

44:17.233 --> 44:20.484
These are the planes
you'll be tangling with.

44:20.552 --> 44:22.992
Know them
so you can identify them.

44:23.060 --> 44:26.647
Plenty of these planes carry
detachable auxiliary gas tanks,

44:26.715 --> 44:28.832
Which give them
great range.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.819
These tanks are dropped when
they reach the objective,

44:31.886 --> 44:35.506
So they don't lessen the
plane's fighting efficiency.

44:35.574 --> 44:41.412
The Kawanishi 96 can carry about a
half a ton of bombs as well as scout.

44:41.480 --> 44:46.668
But the most modern fighter, and the
toughest one to crack, is the Nakajima.

44:46.736 --> 44:50.043
It isn't fast,
but it's light and maneuverable.

44:50.111 --> 44:54.515
If you find yourself in trouble and have to bail
out, there's one important thing to remember:

44:54.582 --> 44:56.684
Do a closed-chute fall.

44:56.752 --> 45:01.371
Drop as far as possible outside the
combat area before pulling the cord.

45:01.439 --> 45:04.691
That's to prevent our little brown
friends from following you down...

45:04.793 --> 45:07.728
And machine-gunning you while
you're hanging helplessly in the air.

45:07.796 --> 45:09.696
It's a quaint little habit
of theirs.

45:09.798 --> 45:12.033
And watch for the man
who's hit the silk.

45:12.100 --> 45:14.057
Protect him
whenever possible.

45:14.125 --> 45:16.059
You know what I'm not
gonna do, pappy?

45:16.126 --> 45:18.395
I'm not gonna ask you what to
do if that chute doesn't open...

45:18.462 --> 45:21.397
- Because you'll say-
- Take it back to the factory.

45:21.465 --> 45:25.319
oh, yeah.

45:27.656 --> 45:30.090
No hits, no runs,
no errors.

45:30.158 --> 45:32.760
There must be something
I'm doing wrong.

45:32.828 --> 45:35.095
Yesterday I unloaded
a whole case of shells...

45:35.163 --> 45:37.936
Before I seen I was firing
at my own shadow on a cloud.

45:37.987 --> 45:41.091
You keep shooting at those clouds,
the angels are gonna get sore at you, boy.

45:41.158 --> 45:44.744
Thirteen for our team and
nobody benched. Nice work, boys.

45:44.846 --> 45:47.448
- Thirteen?
- You ain't superstitious, are you?

45:47.515 --> 45:49.850
If you are, the next time
I go up, I'll make it 14.

45:49.917 --> 45:51.919
Yeah, I'll bet.

45:51.986 --> 45:55.772
I could take that scoreboard down
to the bank and cash it in right now.

45:55.840 --> 45:58.592
Two thousand smackers,
and today's only Thursday.

45:58.660 --> 46:00.944
Any of you hangar pilots
top that yet?

46:01.012 --> 46:04.954
I knew a fellow who tied it once,
only he didn't live to spend it.

46:05.022 --> 46:09.142
It's too bad he waited. I have a feeling, that if
I hit my stride, you guys can take a vacation.

46:10.794 --> 46:14.897
- At my expense, of course.
- How does it feel to be a one-man team?

46:14.965 --> 46:18.268
- I don't get it.
- You're not the first ball carrier...

46:18.336 --> 46:20.270
that didn't appreciate
his interference.

46:20.338 --> 46:22.289
Give me that
in straight English.

46:22.340 --> 46:25.793
Twice I've been on the tail
of a Nakajima...

46:25.860 --> 46:28.434
when you've cut in
for the kill and the credit.

46:28.502 --> 46:31.655
- Hold it, Blackie.
- Wait a minute.

46:31.722 --> 46:34.157
Let him talk.

46:34.224 --> 46:38.378
There's only one guy you think of up there
Woody Jason.

46:38.445 --> 46:40.496
Listen, sorehead,

46:40.564 --> 46:43.833
every time I ever cut in on
you I probably saved your life.

46:43.901 --> 46:46.620
If I were you, I'd be the last
guy to talk about cutting in.

46:46.687 --> 46:51.340
I saw the tunnel that my pal Lefty
Matson dug in the Cleveland air races.

46:51.408 --> 46:53.916
Probably figured his turn wrong.
Everybody saw what happened.

46:53.984 --> 46:58.854
Oh, sure. It was all cleared
up in the investigation.

46:58.922 --> 47:01.356
But they forgot
to smell your breath.

47:08.933 --> 47:11.918
- Quit it! Save it!
- Attention, "a" flight,

47:11.986 --> 47:14.454
Elements "a," "b" and "c".

47:14.522 --> 47:17.894
Enemy aircraft in force
over Mekong bridge. Tails up!

47:17.946 --> 47:20.616
- Get moving, you two guys!
- I'm not through with you yet.

47:20.683 --> 47:23.286
Okay, Tom.
You know where I live.

50:48.994 --> 50:52.514
Hear about Jason?
He got another nippo today.

50:52.581 --> 50:56.367
Yeah. It's too bad they
don't pay off on dead pilots.

50:58.771 --> 51:01.405
Hey, wait a minute, fellas.
You can't pin this mistake on me.

51:01.473 --> 51:04.731
If Blackie hadn't opened his parachute
so soon, it wouldn't have happened.

51:06.717 --> 51:09.836
Maybe if you'd have followed Blackie
down, it wouldn't have happened either.

51:09.904 --> 51:14.091
- You were nearest to him. What happened?
- A Mitsi got in my way.

51:15.694 --> 51:19.681
I guess it's easier to see 500
bucks than a pal of yours in trouble.

51:30.482 --> 51:33.184
Hey, you got five planes now.
That makes you an ace.

51:33.252 --> 51:35.919
"ace"?
How do you spell it?

51:43.612 --> 51:46.780
Mike, that ship gassed?

51:46.848 --> 51:49.800
- Yeah, him full to top.
- Okay.

51:51.152 --> 51:53.960
Oh, Jim, do you mind if I use that ship?

51:54.027 --> 51:56.263
- Where are you going?
- Up for some fresh air.

51:56.330 --> 51:58.565
It's a little heavy
in the barracks.

51:58.633 --> 52:00.634
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

52:02.086 --> 52:04.103
Woody.

52:06.408 --> 52:08.343
I got to know the truth
about one thing:

52:08.410 --> 52:12.162
Could you have prevented
Blackie Bales' death?

52:13.649 --> 52:18.039
No, Jim. I saw him fall, but I
didn't see him open his chute.

52:18.108 --> 52:20.310
I was sure he'd wait
until he was safe.

52:20.378 --> 52:23.830
If I thought he was in danger,
I'd have looked after him.

52:23.898 --> 52:26.333
That's good enough
for me.

52:26.401 --> 52:28.402
Thanks, pappy.

52:55.303 --> 52:57.488
I never saw anything like the
way he went after those ships.

52:57.539 --> 53:00.441
It was something. First one
and then another and then-

53:05.747 --> 53:07.750
None of us want to go,
mrs. Bales.

53:07.817 --> 53:09.772
We'd all like
to live to be 108.

53:09.840 --> 53:11.808
But few of us get a chance to go out...

53:11.876 --> 53:14.043
in a blaze of glory
like Blackie did.

53:14.111 --> 53:16.229
H- he wasn't afraid.

53:16.297 --> 53:18.464
Blackie wasn't afraid
of anything.

53:18.532 --> 53:20.767
You know, we got a pretty
tough bunch of guys up there.

53:20.835 --> 53:23.002
They've got to be for
what they're up against.

53:23.070 --> 53:25.872
But when it came to real fighting
spirit, none could touch Blackie.

53:27.908 --> 53:30.744
- D-did they like him?
- Oh, they were crazy about him.

53:30.812 --> 53:32.747
He was great
to be around;

53:32.815 --> 53:36.906
Always making cracks and
keeping people's spirits up.

53:37.007 --> 53:38.974
I'm glad.

53:40.427 --> 53:44.546
I suppose you'll be
going back to the states.

53:44.614 --> 53:46.883
This belonged
to Blackie.

53:46.985 --> 53:49.786
So much?

53:49.854 --> 53:52.973
Oh, sure. He knocked a
couple down the week before.

53:53.040 --> 53:56.426
- He never wrote me.
- That shows you what kind of a guy he was.

53:56.494 --> 53:59.235
He wouldn't even tell his
wife how well he was doing.

53:59.302 --> 54:01.838
Well...

54:01.905 --> 54:03.856
I got to be going.

54:03.907 --> 54:07.660
Good-bye...
And good luck to you.

55:02.362 --> 55:04.497
Good afternoon, nurse. Good
afternoon, madam Montier.

55:04.565 --> 55:07.466
Are those our children
laughing?

55:07.534 --> 55:11.470
- Yes. It's that wonderful young man
you sent to us. - I sent you?

55:11.538 --> 55:13.478
You were a saint
to think of it.

55:13.546 --> 55:16.414
He's the first ray of sunlight
these children have known in months.

55:18.551 --> 55:20.552
I think I'll take a look
at mr. Sunbeam.

55:27.561 --> 55:31.246
Hurry, hurry, hurry. You're just about
to witness that great, that colossal,

55:31.314 --> 55:36.118
That stupendous mystery known as
the disappearing half a dollar or-

55:39.462 --> 55:41.363
Or now you see it
and now you don't.

55:41.430 --> 55:44.750
Now I need a young lady to assist me.
Will any young lady step up, please?

55:44.817 --> 55:48.120
Some young lady,
any young lady?

55:48.188 --> 55:49.605
You, come on.

55:52.141 --> 55:55.127
Come on. Aw, come on.

55:55.194 --> 55:57.145
Come on.

55:57.213 --> 55:59.615
Aw, come on.
That's the girl.

56:02.369 --> 56:05.676
thank you.

56:05.744 --> 56:08.113
Oh, boy. This will amaze
you before your very eyes!

56:08.180 --> 56:10.181
In my hand here I have
a brand-new half a dollar.

56:10.249 --> 56:13.418
It's brand-new. I made
it myself this morning.

56:13.486 --> 56:15.721
you can still
smell the mint on it.

56:15.789 --> 56:18.741
Uh, I will make it disappear
into my elbow. Watch very closely.

56:18.808 --> 56:21.977
Here it goes. Don't take
your eyes off of my hand.

56:22.045 --> 56:25.898
Well, now, watch me very closely.
Watch very closely what happens.

56:25.965 --> 56:29.874
See? Oop, it slipped!
Watch it closely. You see?

56:29.942 --> 56:33.145
Watch my hand. Everybody
watch it very closely.

56:33.212 --> 56:36.731
Here it goes.
One, two, three.

56:36.799 --> 56:40.285
Hocus-pocus, bowlegged locust.
What happens? It's gone!

56:40.352 --> 56:44.139
What do you know about that?
How do you like that, huh?

56:47.961 --> 56:50.595
I wonder where it is now.

56:50.663 --> 56:54.021
I wonder where it could be.
I think I know.

56:55.173 --> 56:57.224
Yes, I do.
I see it.

56:57.292 --> 57:00.411
Here it is,
right behind your ear!

57:00.479 --> 57:02.413
What do you know
about that?

57:02.481 --> 57:05.884
How do you like that?
Isn't that wonderful?

57:05.952 --> 57:09.538
Yes, well,
thank you very much, miss.

57:09.606 --> 57:12.758
And now-
excuse me.

57:15.928 --> 57:19.904
Don't tell them, but that's
the only trick I know.

57:24.660 --> 57:27.479
You see, my public won't let me go.

57:27.546 --> 57:31.332
If you persuade your public inside, I
might be able to change some bandages.

57:31.399 --> 57:33.901
Absolutely.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

57:33.969 --> 57:37.655
Right this way to see the beautiful
nurse perform the greatest trick.

57:37.723 --> 57:41.442
She is lovely, she is
beautiful... And she's mad at me.

57:51.409 --> 57:53.427
Hurry, hurry.

57:58.918 --> 58:01.586
Come quickly.

59:11.576 --> 59:16.747
Well, I guess
they're going away.

59:16.798 --> 59:18.882
I hope so.

59:18.950 --> 59:21.719
Have the children get ready.
I'll change their bandages now.

59:36.475 --> 59:39.993
Careful. She's slipping. They're pretty
tough to hold when they're this young.

59:40.061 --> 59:42.263
Some of them
never get any older.

59:53.064 --> 59:55.348
Where did you dig up
all these kids?

59:55.416 --> 59:58.018
Most of them were "dug up," as
you put it, after the bombings.

59:58.069 --> 01:00:00.019
Are they all orphans?

01:00:00.087 --> 01:00:05.224
The little girl you're holding walked
almost 1,000 miles across China to get here.

01:00:05.292 --> 01:00:07.661
She lived on roots or whatever
else she could find to eat.

01:00:09.863 --> 01:00:11.815
How did she
find this place?

01:00:11.866 --> 01:00:15.407
I don't know. Some
instinct brings them here.

01:00:15.475 --> 01:00:17.710
Or, perhaps,
one child tells another.

01:00:17.778 --> 01:00:20.930
But always after a bombing,
here they are:

01:00:20.998 --> 01:00:24.100
Starved, patient, silent.

01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:29.789
- I had no idea.
- Very few people do.

01:00:31.543 --> 01:00:33.910
Well-

01:00:33.978 --> 01:00:35.980
There you are,
darling.

01:00:50.635 --> 01:00:54.754
- What's she selling?
- She's brought you these rice cakes as a tribute.

01:00:54.821 --> 01:00:57.390
Tribute? For what? That corny
trick with the half a dollar?

01:00:57.458 --> 01:01:00.226
No, for your courage and loyalty
as a member of the Flying Tigers.

01:01:00.293 --> 01:01:03.418
Oh.
What else did she say?

01:01:03.486 --> 01:01:08.524
Um, we are humbly grateful and beg you
to accept these useless rice cakes...

01:01:08.591 --> 01:01:12.011
even though they are not worthy of
so honorable and so brave a warrior.

01:01:12.078 --> 01:01:14.579
Yeah, well,
tell her okay and thanks,

01:01:14.647 --> 01:01:16.600
And I'll keep them flying.

01:01:16.668 --> 01:01:19.852
Thank you.

01:01:24.558 --> 01:01:26.993
Why don't you have dinner with me
tonight, and we can have these for desert?

01:01:27.061 --> 01:01:29.018
Sorry.
No?

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:31.154
I'm having dinner
with Jim.

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:35.374
Hey, these are good!

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:56.051
You want I should come back
again or you want to order now?

01:01:56.119 --> 01:01:58.070
What's good tonight?

01:01:58.137 --> 01:02:01.190
We have special
american dishes:

01:02:01.257 --> 01:02:05.377
Egg fu yung,
candied duck or chop suey.

01:02:07.314 --> 01:02:09.815
Have you any roast beef
you can cut with a fork?

01:02:09.883 --> 01:02:12.919
You surely have oysters
you can cut with a knife?

01:02:12.987 --> 01:02:16.573
- No floor show?
- No, sir. No floor show.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.798
But music...
Very nice.

01:02:19.866 --> 01:02:22.868
Can't you turn that record
over? Has it only got one side?

01:02:22.936 --> 01:02:26.155
Oh, him turn over,
no music,

01:02:26.223 --> 01:02:28.824
- But him turn over.
- Never mind.

01:02:28.892 --> 01:02:30.926
- We're getting so we like it.
- Thank you.

01:02:30.994 --> 01:02:33.245
Look, chin,
why don't you surprise us?

01:02:33.296 --> 01:02:35.831
Bring us something new
like... Chow Mein.

01:02:35.899 --> 01:02:41.704
Ah, very nice. Very good
chow mein. American dishes.

01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:49.217
Oh, I'm sorry, Brooke.
- Sorry? What are you talking about?

01:02:49.285 --> 01:02:51.620
Well, you know,
all this.

01:02:51.687 --> 01:02:55.207
If we were back in the states, we'd be
having dinner at some good restaurant,

01:02:55.275 --> 01:02:58.827
Dancing once or twice,
might even go out to a show.

01:02:58.895 --> 01:03:01.664
What's the matter with this?
The food here is excellent.

01:03:01.732 --> 01:03:04.716
As for the music, there's a
wonderful orchestra on that record.

01:03:04.784 --> 01:03:08.225
A little hoarse by now,
but we can still dance.

01:03:08.293 --> 01:03:10.228
Ask me and see.

01:03:23.659 --> 01:03:25.610
Miss Elliott,
may I have this dance?

01:03:25.678 --> 01:03:30.448
I've promised it to that dashing
lieutenant in the horse marines...

01:03:30.516 --> 01:03:32.484
But I don't think
he'll mind.

01:04:13.005 --> 01:04:15.740
- What's wrong?
- This came for you.

01:04:15.807 --> 01:04:18.243
It's in code, so I thought
it might be important.

01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:20.711
- I hate to break in on you two.
- That's all right, Hap.

01:04:20.779 --> 01:04:23.219
- I'll have to get back to the field
and decode this. - Of course.

01:04:23.287 --> 01:04:25.422
Sorry, Brooke. I guess we can
never really plan anything-

01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:28.509
Ah, it's ready.
Nice dish, very nice.

01:04:28.576 --> 01:04:31.145
- Sorry, Chin. We got to run along.
- What I do with this?

01:04:31.213 --> 01:04:33.230
You eat it.

01:04:34.349 --> 01:04:38.987
Me eat this?
No, sir. No, sir.

01:04:39.055 --> 01:04:42.274
I dragged you all out of bed and
every place else because this arrived.

01:04:42.341 --> 01:04:44.292
I haven't had any mail for months.

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:46.295
I didn't know that any of
your friends could write.

01:04:46.362 --> 01:04:49.203
Well, here it is.

01:04:49.271 --> 01:04:51.573
"Commencing the first-"
that's tomorrow.

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:55.492
Your squadron assumes continuous night
reconnaissance in alternating patrols".

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:58.396
Signed R.T. Lindsay
and so forth.

01:04:58.447 --> 01:05:01.783
In simple language, that means we
start a night patrol as well as day.

01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:03.784
But, Jim, we're not
set up for night flying.

01:05:03.852 --> 01:05:05.836
We have no beacon
and no landing lights.

01:05:05.904 --> 01:05:08.823
- We'll use the headlights on the trucks.
- How?

01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:12.093
We have six vehicles. We'll line
three up on each side of the runway.

01:05:12.161 --> 01:05:14.951
That's all right for takeoffs,
but what about landings?

01:05:15.019 --> 01:05:17.855
Those lights can be seen from
5,000 feet up on a clear night.

01:05:17.922 --> 01:05:21.308
Fine. Suppose there's a
ground fog. What happens then?

01:05:21.376 --> 01:05:24.177
Well, Woody, all you have
to do is use your fog knife.

01:05:24.245 --> 01:05:26.381
"fog knife"?
What's that?

01:05:26.449 --> 01:05:30.735
- Don't tell me Jason hasn't got one of those.
- Every ace has one.

01:05:30.802 --> 01:05:32.904
Sure. When you're
caught in a heavy fog,

01:05:32.972 --> 01:05:34.872
All you do is cut a hole
in it with your fog knife...

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:37.308
And drop down
like in an elevator.

01:05:37.376 --> 01:05:39.500
You must have fallen through
one of those holes on your head.

01:05:39.567 --> 01:05:43.420
Easy, easy. Let's save that
for the annual barbecue.

01:05:43.488 --> 01:05:46.540
Now pay attention. No
pilots must leave the post.

01:05:46.608 --> 01:05:48.675
All leaves are
automatically canceled.

01:05:48.743 --> 01:05:51.012
Starting tomorrow morning at
10:00, every man on the field...

01:05:51.079 --> 01:05:53.947
Must report to dr. Singh
for a physical checkup.

01:05:54.015 --> 01:05:56.517
That's all.
Scatter and get some sleep.

01:06:02.507 --> 01:06:04.981
- Woody.
- Yeah?

01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:07.450
- Got a minute?
- Sure.

01:06:07.518 --> 01:06:09.786
- What are you gonna do,
stand me in the corner? - No.

01:06:09.853 --> 01:06:13.056
I'll be leading flight "a," and
Hap here will be leading flight "b".

01:06:13.124 --> 01:06:15.893
I want you to take over
Hap's old position,

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:19.313
Number two in back of me
and my flight.

01:06:19.381 --> 01:06:21.649
Okay, pappy.

01:06:21.717 --> 01:06:24.218
Don't worry about a thing. Good night.

01:06:27.222 --> 01:06:29.329
Good night, skipper.

01:06:29.397 --> 01:06:31.398
Good night, Hap.

01:06:37.388 --> 01:06:41.024
Some of you guys don't seem to understand
the reasons for these special tests.

01:06:41.076 --> 01:06:44.010
Sure we do. It's to find out
if we need a seeing eye dog.

01:06:44.078 --> 01:06:47.014
okay, okay.
It's funny now.

01:06:47.082 --> 01:06:49.015
The first time
you're on a night flight...

01:06:49.083 --> 01:06:51.351
And a string of tracers come
hissing out at you from the dark,

01:06:51.419 --> 01:06:55.978
You'll be glad we rechecked your
eyesight and reflexes. Sure. We know that.

01:06:56.046 --> 01:06:58.965
Night patrol calls for peak efficiency
and perfect physical fitness.

01:06:59.032 --> 01:07:00.983
Right.

01:07:01.051 --> 01:07:02.986
- Where did you dig that up?
- Well, I've been studying.

01:07:06.108 --> 01:07:09.042
Don't, doc. That's cold, and I'm ticklish.

01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:11.312
Nothing wrong
with his reflexes.

01:07:21.796 --> 01:07:24.264
Alignment blocks,
please.

01:07:48.345 --> 01:07:51.364
Is everything
all right?

01:07:51.431 --> 01:07:53.932
All these reports go
to squadron leader Gordon.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.019
The final decision
rests with him.

01:07:56.086 --> 01:07:58.938
I sure would hate
to miss out on night patrol.

01:07:59.006 --> 01:08:02.593
I hear those japos
glow in the dark like bugs.

01:08:04.178 --> 01:08:06.613
Good morning, gentlemen.
Having your oil changed?

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:10.139
Well, is my eyesight failing me or is
it that beautiful hunk of man?

01:08:10.207 --> 01:08:12.642
You keep that up and someday
they'll put you on the radio.

01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:16.495
Come on, fellas. Let's go to the gasoline
dump and get a breath of fresh air.

01:08:20.050 --> 01:08:23.301
- You asked for that. Jason
- Okay, okay! I'm not beefing, am I?

01:08:23.370 --> 01:08:26.656
- Where's the gadget you wanted me to come
back for, doctor? - Yes, over here, please.

01:08:26.724 --> 01:08:30.142
When I examined mr. Jason this
morning, this had not arrived yet.

01:08:30.210 --> 01:08:32.881
I asked him to come back
with the others.

01:08:39.408 --> 01:08:42.010
- Is that what you wanted?
- Yes, thank you.

01:08:42.078 --> 01:08:45.665
- Thank you. - You know, Jason,
people that fly upside down...

01:08:45.733 --> 01:08:48.984
.get a pretty twisted picture of
what's going on all around them.

01:08:49.053 --> 01:08:51.988
Yeah, thanks, Hap.
Thanks a lot.

01:08:52.055 --> 01:08:54.157
You well enough
to travel, Alabama?

01:08:54.225 --> 01:08:57.411
Huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:08:57.478 --> 01:09:00.435
All right, mr. Hap.

01:09:07.778 --> 01:09:09.678
Think I'll fall apart, doc?

01:09:09.746 --> 01:09:11.846
You should outlive
Confucius.

01:09:11.915 --> 01:09:13.932
That's good enough for me.

01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:29.571
You want to see me, skipper?

01:09:29.639 --> 01:09:31.907
Sit down, hap.

01:09:31.975 --> 01:09:34.576
I've made a change.

01:09:34.644 --> 01:09:39.215
Tex Norton will lead flight "b"
instead of you. That's okay, Jim.

01:09:39.316 --> 01:09:42.252
I'd rather be up there in my old
spot anyway, protecting your tail.

01:09:42.319 --> 01:09:44.787
It isn't that, Hap.

01:09:44.854 --> 01:09:48.044
I gotta hand you one
on the chin.

01:09:48.112 --> 01:09:51.233
But I'd rather it came from me
than from somebody else.

01:09:52.335 --> 01:09:54.336
Go ahead, Jim.

01:09:55.955 --> 01:09:57.956
You're through flying.

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.715
The doc said I'd live
to be a hundred.

01:10:06.817 --> 01:10:09.217
If you stay
on the ground.

01:10:10.403 --> 01:10:12.421
Oh.

01:10:15.047 --> 01:10:17.014
I see.

01:10:20.836 --> 01:10:23.237
Okay.

01:10:23.305 --> 01:10:27.476
- Was there anything else?
- No.

01:10:29.162 --> 01:10:31.196
Wait a minute.

01:10:31.264 --> 01:10:34.467
I can't send a man up that doesn't know
whether he's flying upside-down or not.

01:10:34.534 --> 01:10:39.478
Take a look at that physical.
Your depth perception's a mile off.

01:10:39.545 --> 01:10:44.048
I know you've been gunning 'em since they
were box kites with broomsticks for rudders,

01:10:44.116 --> 01:10:47.001
But, you gotta believe me,
I'm doing this for you!

01:10:47.069 --> 01:10:50.405
You've been close winging in
formations, overshooting your landings-

01:10:50.473 --> 01:10:52.907
You don't have
to say any more!

01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:56.878
I'm sorry.

01:10:59.448 --> 01:11:02.769
I was kind of figuring on
going back to the states anyway,

01:11:02.837 --> 01:11:06.527
Maybe get me a chicken ranch
or something.

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:09.630
- I hear there's a lot of dough in eggs.
- Eggs?

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:11.933
Who are you trying to kid?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.034
You haven't been
saving any money.

01:11:14.102 --> 01:11:17.306
You've been giving it away
as fast as you make it.

01:11:19.075 --> 01:11:21.844
Look, Hap,
I need you here.

01:11:23.363 --> 01:11:25.797
What could I do now?

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:27.868
Taking care of these crates on
the ground is just as important...

01:11:27.937 --> 01:11:30.207
As flying them upstairs.

01:11:30.275 --> 01:11:33.311
I got to have a man
I can trust on the ground.

01:11:33.379 --> 01:11:36.331
I wish you'd take that job,
Hap.

01:11:36.398 --> 01:11:39.500
- You're not doing this to...
- No.

01:11:39.568 --> 01:11:42.720
I really need you.

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:49.710
Well, ground kind of
hurts my arches,

01:11:49.778 --> 01:11:54.821
But, well,
I'll think about it.

01:11:54.889 --> 01:11:56.891
Thanks, Hap.

01:12:00.912 --> 01:12:03.180
Wait a minute.
I didn't swing at that one.

01:12:03.248 --> 01:12:05.683
Come on.

01:12:05.751 --> 01:12:08.486
Okay. I never could bat
without my spike shoes anyway.

01:12:08.554 --> 01:12:10.755
- Come on, come on.
- You're out.

01:12:10.822 --> 01:12:13.158
Come on,
let her go.

01:12:22.357 --> 01:12:25.208
- Woody.
- Hello!

01:12:25.276 --> 01:12:27.945
- How are things going?
- You better not be seen talking to me.

01:12:28.013 --> 01:12:31.031
I'm poison ivy. Everything I
touch breaks out into a rash.

01:12:32.351 --> 01:12:35.769
I, um, I just got a letter from mrs. Bales.

01:12:35.837 --> 01:12:39.257
- What's she writing you about?
- I sent her Blackie's things. She wrote to thank me.

01:12:39.324 --> 01:12:42.477
- Oh. - She said to be sure
and give you her regards.

01:12:42.544 --> 01:12:46.336
- Well, um... - You are a difficult man
to get to know, aren't you?

01:12:46.403 --> 01:12:48.538
Why don't you have dinner with me
tonight and get to know me better?

01:12:48.606 --> 01:12:50.740
You don't take no
for an answer, do you?

01:12:50.808 --> 01:12:53.443
Why should I, when it's
just as easy to say yes?

01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:56.514
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

01:12:56.582 --> 01:12:59.400
Well, swell! I'll meet you
tonight at the orphanage at 8:00.

01:12:59.468 --> 01:13:01.902
- Right?
- Okay. See you later.

01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:03.971
Uh, wait a minute.

01:13:05.791 --> 01:13:10.100
Don't say anything to anybody
about mrs. Bales, will you?

01:13:10.168 --> 01:13:14.221
I don't want to spoil my record. All right.

01:13:14.288 --> 01:13:18.175
And be on time!
Hey, 'bama.

01:13:18.242 --> 01:13:21.161
Those guys only got seven lucky
hits off of me in three innings.

01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:24.314
Yeah, swell. I'm going off the
reservation tonight. I got a date.

01:13:24.382 --> 01:13:26.333
What about night patrol?
You're on "a" flight.

01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:28.302
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'll be back in time.

01:13:28.369 --> 01:13:31.539
But if anyone asks any
questions about me, you cover me.

01:13:33.346 --> 01:13:36.016
I'm getting
that old feeling.

01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:44.340
All right, fellas, synchronize
your watches at 10:55.

01:13:44.408 --> 01:13:47.345
It's now 10:54 and 57...

01:13:47.412 --> 01:13:51.032
58, 59, mark it.

01:13:51.133 --> 01:13:54.451
- Tex, "b" flight must relieve us
at exactly 11:55. - Right.

01:13:54.519 --> 01:13:58.477
Otherwise, we might mistake you
for the enemy. That's about it.

01:13:58.546 --> 01:14:01.181
Take off in four minutes.

01:14:01.249 --> 01:14:03.216
I thought Jason was here.

01:14:04.835 --> 01:14:07.771
Well, I thought I saw him getting
dressed just a few minutes ago, sir.

01:14:07.839 --> 01:14:10.039
- Well, get him on the field.
- Yes, sir.

01:14:10.107 --> 01:14:12.109
Warm 'em up.

01:14:14.912 --> 01:14:18.098
- Did you see Woody? I just
stalled the skipper. - No.

01:14:18.165 --> 01:14:20.801
He'll wring my neck too if he
finds out Woody left the field.

01:14:20.869 --> 01:14:23.776
- Against orders?
- Yeah, but he said he'd be right back.

01:14:23.844 --> 01:14:26.763
Well, he's Jim's number two man.
He'd better be back.

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:44.314
Tell pilot Jason
takeoff is in two minutes.

01:14:44.382 --> 01:14:46.333
Yes, sir.

01:14:46.401 --> 01:14:49.659
- All right, warm it up, Mike.
- Okeydokey.

01:14:50.978 --> 01:14:53.079
- Waiting for mr. Jason, please.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:14:53.147 --> 01:14:57.000
- Tell him he'll be right there.
- Yes, sir.

01:14:59.253 --> 01:15:02.405
- I still don't think this is right.
- You keep your mouth shut.

01:15:02.473 --> 01:15:04.607
But if anybody's gonna take
Woody's flight, it ought to be me.

01:15:04.675 --> 01:15:08.127
Are you crazy? I've been flying
number two for Jim for over a year.

01:15:08.195 --> 01:15:10.346
I know every one of his
quirks, every one of his moves.

01:15:10.414 --> 01:15:12.750
- We're a team. Don't you understand?
- Yeah, I know, but-

01:15:12.819 --> 01:15:15.908
It's like he was the ball carrier
and I was his interference.

01:15:15.976 --> 01:15:18.510
Yeah, sure,
but I still don't like it.

01:15:18.578 --> 01:15:22.064
- You're to stay on the ground.
- Not so long as Jim is in the air.

01:16:27.377 --> 01:16:29.318
Missed the 5:15 again.

01:16:29.386 --> 01:16:32.605
- You're gonna have a hard time talking yourself
out of this one. - Who, me and pappy? No.

01:16:32.672 --> 01:16:35.440
- I wonder who's flying number two?
- Where have you been?

01:16:35.508 --> 01:16:38.210
- I'm late. So what?
- So hap took your flight, that's what.

01:16:38.278 --> 01:16:42.648
- All right, I'd do as much for him, wouldn't I?
- But Hap was grounded.

01:16:42.716 --> 01:16:44.733
Yeah.

01:17:23.619 --> 01:17:26.338
"a" leader to "a" two.
Go ahead.

01:17:29.075 --> 01:17:32.177
What's the matter, Jason?
Have you gone to sleep?

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.069
"a" two to "a" leader.
What do you want? Go ahead.

01:17:41.137 --> 01:17:45.680
Hap! Where's Jason? What are
you doing here? Go on back!

01:17:45.748 --> 01:17:50.051
Sorry, Jim. Remember me? I'm the
little man who's always there.

01:17:52.104 --> 01:17:54.239
Besides, it's too late.

01:18:00.096 --> 01:18:04.850
"a" leader to flight "a". Nakajima
fighters on port quarter. Combat formation.

01:18:51.877 --> 01:18:54.847
Attaboy, skipper!
Give 'em the old one-two!

01:19:14.974 --> 01:19:17.691
Don't worry, Jim.
I'm climbing his back porch now.

01:19:35.584 --> 01:19:37.301
Pull out, Hap!
Pull out!

01:21:43.277 --> 01:21:46.096
I hope you two
had a good time...

01:21:46.163 --> 01:21:48.181
'cause Hap paid the check.

01:22:31.355 --> 01:22:33.372
Jim.

01:22:36.427 --> 01:22:39.878
There's an army truck out of here day
after tomorrow for Lai Chau. Be on it.

01:22:39.946 --> 01:22:42.649
- Don't say that, Jim.
- Until then, you're confined to your quarters.

01:22:42.717 --> 01:22:44.856
But I'm still a good flyer.

01:22:44.924 --> 01:22:47.109
I'll knock down ten of those
rats for every one of our boys.

01:22:47.177 --> 01:22:52.214
It's out of my hands now. None of
these men will ever fly with you again,

01:22:52.265 --> 01:22:54.282
And they have to fly.

01:23:09.305 --> 01:23:11.407
Yesterday...

01:23:11.475 --> 01:23:15.894
December 7, 1941...

01:23:17.831 --> 01:23:20.565
A date which will live...

01:23:20.633 --> 01:23:23.369
in infamy.

01:23:23.436 --> 01:23:26.389
The United States
of America...

01:23:26.456 --> 01:23:29.841
Was suddenly
and deliberately attacked...

01:23:29.909 --> 01:23:32.161
By naval and air forces...

01:23:32.229 --> 01:23:35.019
of the empire of Japan.

01:23:35.087 --> 01:23:39.307
The United States was
at peace with that nation...

01:23:39.375 --> 01:23:44.379
and at the solicitation
of Japan...

01:23:44.446 --> 01:23:47.366
was still in conversation...

01:23:47.434 --> 01:23:50.502
with its government
and its emperor...

01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:55.974
Looking towards the maintenance
of peace in the pacific.

01:23:56.042 --> 01:24:01.437
I believe that I incorporate
the will of the congress...

01:24:01.504 --> 01:24:05.056
and of the people
when I assert...

01:24:05.124 --> 01:24:10.195
that we will not only defend
ourselves to the uttermost,

01:24:10.262 --> 01:24:13.682
But will make it
very certain...

01:24:13.749 --> 01:24:16.552
That this form
of treachery...

01:24:16.619 --> 01:24:19.354
shall never again
endanger us.

01:24:28.737 --> 01:24:31.539
Hostilities exist.

01:24:31.607 --> 01:24:34.892
there is no blinking
at the fact...

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:38.597
that our people,
our territory...

01:24:38.648 --> 01:24:40.765
and our interests...

01:24:40.833 --> 01:24:43.502
are in grave danger.

01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:48.210
With confidence
in our armed forces,

01:24:48.278 --> 01:24:50.915
With the unbounding
determination...

01:24:50.983 --> 01:24:52.917
of our people,

01:24:52.985 --> 01:24:55.887
we will gain...

01:24:55.954 --> 01:24:57.889
the inevitable triumph...

01:24:57.957 --> 01:24:59.891
So help us, god.

01:25:06.482 --> 01:25:11.520
I ask that the congress
declare...

01:25:11.587 --> 01:25:14.978
That since the unprovoked...

01:25:15.046 --> 01:25:19.700
and dastardly attack
by Japan...

01:25:19.768 --> 01:25:25.657
on Sunday,
December 7, 1941...

01:25:25.724 --> 01:25:31.380
a state of war
has existed...

01:25:31.447 --> 01:25:33.882
between the United States...

01:25:33.949 --> 01:25:36.351
and the japanese empire.

01:26:19.892 --> 01:26:22.694
- How are you, Jim?
- Good, colonel. And you?

01:26:34.763 --> 01:26:37.365
I don't have to tell you what
our entrance into the war means...

01:26:37.416 --> 01:26:39.366
to the volunteer group
in China.

01:26:39.434 --> 01:26:44.371
Our responsibility is grave. You and your
men will have to take greater risks now.

01:26:44.439 --> 01:26:48.192
I think they know it, sir.
This hits them where they live.

01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:52.530
- I don't think any of them will let you down.
- I'm sure they won't.

01:26:52.597 --> 01:26:55.204
Come here.

01:26:55.272 --> 01:26:59.726
Intelligence reports that the japanese
are starting a new drive from this point.

01:26:59.794 --> 01:27:03.613
But to camouflage that move, they're
starting a fake attack from this point.

01:27:03.681 --> 01:27:07.235
Under cover of which, they intend to
bring up supplies and munitions from here.

01:27:07.303 --> 01:27:11.405
Now, we must destroy this bridge and delay
the supply trains which pass over it.

01:27:11.473 --> 01:27:14.392
- I see. - That's the only way we
can give general Chiang Kai-Shek...

01:27:14.459 --> 01:27:16.895
sufficient time
to establish his defenses.

01:27:16.962 --> 01:27:21.905
I know that area. It's a nest of
antiaircraft and Nakajima squadrons.

01:27:21.973 --> 01:27:25.058
Thank you. They can send
up an anac umbrella...

01:27:25.126 --> 01:27:27.560
high enough to make
any attack ineffective.

01:27:27.628 --> 01:27:29.580
I warned you what
we'd be up against.

01:27:29.648 --> 01:27:33.600
- But there's a way to do it, I think.
- Yeah?

01:27:33.652 --> 01:27:38.104
A bomber squadron, even with our
protection, wouldn't stand a chance.

01:27:38.172 --> 01:27:40.574
- But a single ship might get through.
- How?

01:27:40.642 --> 01:27:44.100
By flying through the canyons
instead of over them.

01:27:44.168 --> 01:27:48.120
Taking off at dawn and hugging the
sides of the hills away from the sun,

01:27:48.188 --> 01:27:52.175
A pilot might bring his ship through
the pass and directly over the bridge.

01:27:52.242 --> 01:27:56.613
- Sounds like hedgehopping to suicide.
- Maybe.

01:27:56.681 --> 01:28:00.434
But if you think it can be done,
I'll order a bomber here right away.

01:28:00.502 --> 01:28:03.303
- I think we can use that transport.
- What?

01:28:03.371 --> 01:28:06.456
They've been flying over
enemy territory for five years.

01:28:06.524 --> 01:28:11.467
They get potted at, of course, but they don't
attract as much attention as a military ship.

01:28:11.535 --> 01:28:14.304
What about bombs? It's got no bomb
rack, no bomb release, nothing.

01:28:14.372 --> 01:28:16.472
We can figure that out.

01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:21.311
There's eight or nine cans in our
munition dump marked, "nitro U.S.A".

01:28:21.378 --> 01:28:25.465
I think I can find
a messenger boy to deliver them.

01:28:25.533 --> 01:28:28.668
A job for a volunteer,
of course.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:30.737
Of course.

01:29:08.288 --> 01:29:11.224
Doggone it. You ought to
be tar and feathered, Woody.

01:29:11.275 --> 01:29:14.878
Getting yourself slung out of this outfit
just when things are getting exciting.

01:29:14.945 --> 01:29:17.863
What's going on out there?

01:29:17.931 --> 01:29:20.566
- Huh?
- You heard me. What's happening?

01:29:25.812 --> 01:29:27.712
That's the skipper's idea.

01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:29.899
He's gonna go fix breakfast
for the jappies.

01:29:29.966 --> 01:29:32.067
Gonna serve them soup.

01:29:32.135 --> 01:29:35.388
- Who's going with him?
- Nobody.

01:29:35.456 --> 01:29:38.124
If you ask me,
it's a one-way trip.

01:29:45.132 --> 01:29:48.606
These reports must go out daily to keep
colonel Lindsay informed on our status.

01:29:48.674 --> 01:29:50.776
Yes, sir. Ship Norton to ground operation,

01:29:50.844 --> 01:29:53.612
Selby and Evans
to night patrol, flight "a".

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:57.749
- Miller ought to be about ready now to start in
again with Reardon as a team. - Right.

01:29:57.817 --> 01:30:01.120
That's about all, except you'll have to keep
after Kunming for gas, oil and supplies...

01:30:01.188 --> 01:30:03.455
and Toungoo for replacements.

01:30:03.523 --> 01:30:06.608
- Take good care of the store, Mac.
- I will, sir.

01:30:06.676 --> 01:30:08.827
I-
good luck to you.

01:30:08.879 --> 01:30:11.847
Thank you, mac.
Come in.

01:30:13.001 --> 01:30:15.807
Yes?

01:30:15.875 --> 01:30:18.643
I have dr. Singh's
report on Barton.

01:30:18.711 --> 01:30:21.796
How is he?

01:30:21.864 --> 01:30:24.166
You can have him back
in a week.

01:30:28.021 --> 01:30:31.324
- Colonel Lindsay's waiting outside, Jim.
- Right.

01:30:31.375 --> 01:30:33.977
Jim!

01:30:34.044 --> 01:30:36.479
Good luck.

01:30:36.546 --> 01:30:38.569
Thanks.

01:31:08.657 --> 01:31:10.859
I haven't wanted
to question you, Jim,

01:31:10.926 --> 01:31:13.211
But I thought you were
gonna call for volunteers.

01:31:13.262 --> 01:31:15.615
It only takes one,
doesn't it?

01:31:17.250 --> 01:31:19.919
Thank you, colonel.

01:31:27.494 --> 01:31:32.203
Mike, rev it down!
Mike, cut those motors!

01:31:34.106 --> 01:31:38.677
What do you think you're doing?
Cut those motors!

01:31:46.652 --> 01:31:49.321
Get into your parachute.

01:31:55.734 --> 01:31:59.987
I'd land and throw you out if I could
take a chance on that cargo back there.

01:32:00.055 --> 01:32:01.989
Bail out at 1,500.

01:32:02.057 --> 01:32:06.278
You can't handle this crate all by
yourself. It's a job for the two of us.

01:32:06.379 --> 01:32:08.747
Somebody's got to handle this stick
while the other guy drops the stuff.

01:32:08.849 --> 01:32:12.167
- You know that as well as I do.
- Not the way I got it rigged.

01:32:13.854 --> 01:32:17.941
I know I've been a lot of trouble to
you since we first got to be friends.

01:32:18.009 --> 01:32:20.932
You're the only guy I know
who stuck by me.

01:32:20.999 --> 01:32:23.969
If you're trying to alibi the way
you've been living, we'll run out of gas.

01:32:24.036 --> 01:32:26.104
Maybe I did start out just
to have a bunch of laughs-

01:32:26.171 --> 01:32:29.307
Woody, anyone who looks ahead
in this racket is crazy.

01:32:29.375 --> 01:32:31.776
I don't blame you
for grabbing what you can today.

01:32:31.844 --> 01:32:35.880
You don't mean that. If you did,
you'd have dropped me long ago.

01:32:37.132 --> 01:32:39.084
Hit the silk.

01:32:39.151 --> 01:32:41.486
Look, Jim...

01:32:41.553 --> 01:32:43.459
I had to talk to you.

01:32:43.527 --> 01:32:46.497
I don't know where
I'm going from here or...

01:32:46.564 --> 01:32:48.599
When I'll see you again.

01:32:48.667 --> 01:32:51.101
It's like
Brooke said:

01:32:51.169 --> 01:32:53.471
I don't know anything
about anything:

01:32:53.538 --> 01:32:57.825
Why we're here, why we're
fighting, all that sort of stuff.

01:32:57.893 --> 01:33:00.061
She tried
to straighten me out too.

01:33:00.129 --> 01:33:04.016
Although half the time she was
talking about you and roast beef...

01:33:04.083 --> 01:33:07.201
And San Francisco and
all those crazy things.

01:33:07.269 --> 01:33:12.246
- See what I mean?
- 1,500.

01:33:14.266 --> 01:33:16.901
- Are we gonna say good-bye like this?
- Bail out!

01:33:16.968 --> 01:33:20.805
Okay.
I got it coming to me.

01:33:20.872 --> 01:33:22.823
But there's one thing
you gotta get straight on.

01:33:22.891 --> 01:33:26.177
A whole lot of us just
don't grow up. We stay kids.

01:33:26.244 --> 01:33:29.213
The most important thing to a
kid is the street he lives on.

01:33:29.281 --> 01:33:31.549
It's his life.
It's his whole world.

01:33:31.616 --> 01:33:34.258
That was me when I first
joined up with you.

01:33:34.326 --> 01:33:37.060
Hong Kong, Shanghai,
Chungking-

01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:39.229
They didn't mean
anything to me.

01:33:39.297 --> 01:33:41.265
Just a lot of names
in a geography book,

01:33:41.332 --> 01:33:45.303
Not towns where millions of people
were being maimed and killed by bombs.

01:33:45.371 --> 01:33:48.723
If you called them Texas,
Maine or Michigan...

01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:50.892
That would have been different.

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:56.264
They were my street. That's
why I acted the way I did.

01:33:56.332 --> 01:33:59.789
Not because I was a heel,
but because I was still a kid.

01:33:59.857 --> 01:34:02.393
It cost another man's life
to make a man out of me.

01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:04.561
If you don't think that will
stay on my mind as long as I live,

01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:09.416
Then you don't know any more about me
than... I think you did in the first place.

01:34:09.484 --> 01:34:13.037
Well... That's all,
and happy landing.

01:34:13.104 --> 01:34:15.923
Sit down, Woody.

01:34:15.991 --> 01:34:18.275
Check the course.

01:34:20.511 --> 01:34:23.334
Okay, pappy.

01:34:40.138 --> 01:34:44.124
Well, here we go
into the tunnel of love.

01:34:58.847 --> 01:35:02.048
Pull her up!

01:35:09.057 --> 01:35:11.825
Did you know I used
to drive a roller coaster?

01:35:11.892 --> 01:35:14.501
- Delivering nitro?
- Yes.

01:35:14.568 --> 01:35:17.069
- Were you killed?
- Uh-huh.

01:35:22.926 --> 01:35:26.880
- Take over. I want to get into this chute.
- Right.

01:35:38.849 --> 01:35:40.884
Looks like
the supply trains are moving.

01:35:40.951 --> 01:35:43.185
But the bridge ain't.

01:35:43.287 --> 01:35:47.206
You may serve
the soup course now, pappy.

01:36:04.197 --> 01:36:06.232
Get her closer.

01:36:06.299 --> 01:36:09.585
If I get any closer to that bridge
we'll have to pay a toll charge.

01:36:16.411 --> 01:36:19.078
- Let her go!
- Not yet!

01:36:37.087 --> 01:36:38.988
Give the gentleman
a cigar!

01:36:39.055 --> 01:36:41.591
If they want to cross that
river, they'll have to swim it.

01:36:53.055 --> 01:36:55.110
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

01:36:55.161 --> 01:36:58.397
This crate's got enough lead in
its belly to sink a battleship.

01:37:00.266 --> 01:37:03.068
Don't look now, but our
tail feathers are on fire.

01:37:03.136 --> 01:37:06.790
- Huh?
- This is it, pappy. Let's take a powder.

01:37:06.857 --> 01:37:10.026
Six cans of nitro aboard
and that train's still running.

01:37:10.093 --> 01:37:13.579
Yeah, but this is one train we're
gonna have to miss. Come on, let's go.

01:37:13.647 --> 01:37:16.533
- Right.
- Throw it on automatic.

01:37:36.726 --> 01:37:38.744
Come on!
Hit the silk, Woody!

01:37:41.247 --> 01:37:43.386
Here we go!

01:37:47.927 --> 01:37:49.978
Happy landing, Jim.

01:38:53.823 --> 01:38:56.958
Do me a favor,
will you, pappy?

01:38:57.026 --> 01:39:01.486
Give my leather jacket to
Reardon. He's a cold character.

01:39:01.553 --> 01:39:05.773
Divide my address book evenly
between the boys in the barracks.

01:39:05.875 --> 01:39:10.979
and give my silk scarf to the next head-chopper
that thinks this is an easy racket.

01:39:11.046 --> 01:39:13.382
Woody.

01:39:15.684 --> 01:39:18.387
Come in.

01:39:19.705 --> 01:39:22.825
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes, Barratt.

01:39:22.893 --> 01:39:26.817
This is your first time up. Don't
try to win this war all by yourself.

01:39:26.885 --> 01:39:31.155
Stay close to formation. If you find yourself
in trouble, pour on the coal and head home.

01:39:31.223 --> 01:39:34.057
- Yes, sir.
- Just a minute.

01:39:35.245 --> 01:39:37.312
This is for you.

01:39:37.379 --> 01:39:41.333
- Gee, thanks.
- Take good care of it.

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:43.668
- It belonged to a pretty good flier.
- Sure.

01:39:43.736 --> 01:39:45.687
Flight "a". flight "a".

01:39:45.755 --> 01:39:47.857
Reconnaissance patrol,
two minutes.

01:39:47.925 --> 01:39:52.233
- How about having dinner with me? I hear
Chin has a new record. - Swell.
