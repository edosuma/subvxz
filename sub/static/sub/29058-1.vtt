00:56.075 --> 00:57.609
It's vacation! It's vacation!

00:57.611 --> 00:59.903
I'm working. You're on vacation.

00:59.905 --> 01:00.965
You better watch out.

01:02.085 --> 01:03.503
Oh my God. Look at that woman.

01:03.505 --> 01:04.985
That's so scary.

01:53.535 --> 01:56.233
I'm sure she'll introduce herself.

01:56.235 --> 01:57.795
We'll figure it out that way.

02:04.546 --> 02:06.493
How are you? Oh, so excited to have you.

02:06.495 --> 02:07.594
Thank you so much. I'm so...

02:07.596 --> 02:11.273
You weren't waiting long, were you?

02:11.275 --> 02:14.293
So uh, what time will
we get started tomorrow?

02:14.295 --> 02:17.065
Oh, yes. Tomorrow, nine to five.

02:18.485 --> 02:20.733
And the actors got here yesterday.

02:20.735 --> 02:22.143
They totally fucked up this car.

02:22.145 --> 02:24.713
It smelled like McDonald's
for like 12 hours,

02:24.715 --> 02:26.283
so I aired it out.

02:26.285 --> 02:28.923
I used some... It's kind of nice.

02:28.925 --> 02:30.313
It's like a pine scented thing.

02:30.315 --> 02:31.923
My friend actually makes it in her house,

02:31.925 --> 02:33.033
but you would never know that,

02:33.035 --> 02:35.363
because it has a really nice label.

02:35.365 --> 02:36.383
But it's like an air freshener.

02:36.385 --> 02:37.913
Anyway, point is,

02:37.915 --> 02:39.123
I don't think it smells
like chicken anymore.

02:39.125 --> 02:41.313
But it did, and I was mad.

02:41.315 --> 02:42.953
I appreciate that.

02:42.955 --> 02:45.003
Where do you get your inspiration?

02:45.005 --> 02:48.573
Oh. New York City is ripe.

02:48.575 --> 02:52.633
I mean, anywhere you
go there's characters.

02:52.635 --> 02:54.233
It's awesome.

02:54.235 --> 02:56.893
That's one of the many great things

02:56.895 --> 02:57.903
about living in the city.

02:57.905 --> 02:59.233
I don't know how you do it though,

02:59.235 --> 03:00.493
because it's hard to make art there.

03:00.495 --> 03:01.963
I think make my art better out here.

03:01.965 --> 03:04.253
But then I also feel
like I found my calling,

03:04.255 --> 03:05.843
which is not necessarily
to make my own art,

03:05.845 --> 03:08.355
but to facilitate other
people's art, hence...

03:10.023 --> 03:13.003
I mean, that's why coming
here to places like this

03:13.005 --> 03:14.585
kind of helps balance it out.

03:15.595 --> 03:19.153
Yeah, it's really interesting,
this type of vegetation.

03:19.155 --> 03:21.503
We don't really have that in Brazil.

03:21.505 --> 03:23.513
I went there for like one
month when I was in school.

03:23.515 --> 03:24.623
I was studying.

03:24.625 --> 03:26.603
Ah, the people are just so beautiful.

03:26.605 --> 03:28.163
And I always wanted to
go back, always, always,

03:28.165 --> 03:30.303
more than any other place
in the entire world.

03:30.305 --> 03:31.773
Ah, that's so nice.

03:31.775 --> 03:35.446
The fucking men are
gorgeous! They're gorgeous.

03:35.448 --> 03:36.673
It's another level.

03:36.675 --> 03:37.903
I mean, and the women are gorgeous too,

03:37.905 --> 03:38.983
which is unfortunate for people like me.

03:38.985 --> 03:40.613
Like I don't have really any boobs.

03:40.615 --> 03:41.446
And so you kind of have to like...

03:41.448 --> 03:43.608
That's just between us three.

03:43.610 --> 03:45.943
But the men there don't fucking care.

03:45.945 --> 03:48.943
I mean, I have an ass,
so that gets your far.

03:48.945 --> 03:50.403
You know, it's like a
Latin American thing.

03:50.405 --> 03:52.603
I mean I think it's just like
an anyone who's not white.

03:52.605 --> 03:53.563
I don't know why white men,

03:53.565 --> 03:56.003
they just don't want you to have any ass.

03:56.005 --> 03:57.755
What do you do, by the way, Monica?

03:58.715 --> 04:00.173
I came to the United States

04:00.175 --> 04:03.223
to go to school for
environmental engineering.

04:03.225 --> 04:04.535
Wow.

04:05.805 --> 04:08.723
Earth. That's like Earth stuff, right?

04:08.725 --> 04:11.743
Well I mainly deal with trees.

04:11.745 --> 04:14.143
And the impact of roads,

04:14.145 --> 04:16.473
and when we are going to build bridges,

04:16.475 --> 04:17.743
or things like that.

04:17.745 --> 04:20.413
So I just focus on trees.

04:20.415 --> 04:22.275
There's plenty of trees here.

04:23.645 --> 04:25.245
So how did you guys meet then?

04:28.510 --> 04:32.233
I went to this topless bar one night.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.873
She was working, and I was like,

05:04.875 --> 05:06.793
"Ooh, I want that one."

05:06.795 --> 05:07.883
She had boobs.

05:07.885 --> 05:09.463
There are a lot of people up here

05:09.465 --> 05:13.308
who are like you guys.

05:13.310 --> 05:15.493
What do you mean, like us?

05:15.495 --> 05:16.328
Like...

05:18.445 --> 05:22.758
Into alternative sexuality, I guess.

05:22.760 --> 05:25.923
But I think it's honestly,
it's like the men...

05:25.925 --> 05:28.133
I feel like once you get
north of the Mason-Dixon line,

05:28.135 --> 05:30.453
it is very hard to find a good man around.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.533
So, it's like, I understand.

05:32.535 --> 05:34.043
I mean, that's what it needs to be.

05:34.045 --> 05:35.103
Because we can't keep having babies.

05:35.105 --> 05:36.203
What are we gonna do?

05:36.205 --> 05:37.453
Like, if you don't have kids,

05:37.455 --> 05:39.973
that is just so good for the environment.

05:39.975 --> 05:41.965
I still want to have a child.

05:43.455 --> 05:45.993
Oh, are you going to adopt one?

05:45.995 --> 05:47.413
No. I want to have my own.

05:47.415 --> 05:51.015
So probably will find a donor.

05:51.875 --> 05:52.708
Oh.

05:56.005 --> 05:58.293
Who would you get?

05:58.295 --> 06:00.033
We're thinking maybe her brother.

06:00.035 --> 06:01.173
Oh, that's weird.

06:01.175 --> 06:04.433
Well, I mean, that's on the table.

06:04.435 --> 06:06.765
- We talked about that.
- Your brother?

06:08.175 --> 06:09.493
Oh my gosh.

06:09.495 --> 06:12.403
Well, it would be like
having her blood in me.

06:12.405 --> 06:17.393
You know, part of her family
tree with my family tree.

06:17.395 --> 06:18.226
It just makes sense.

06:18.228 --> 06:20.343
I feel like having
sex with your brother...

06:20.345 --> 06:23.733
No one is having sex with anyone.

06:23.735 --> 06:26.795
It's gonna be artificially inseminated.

06:31.225 --> 06:34.658
She looks like an '80s rock
star in that little outfit.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.873
- That's mean.
- No, that's not mean!

06:36.875 --> 06:40.446
It's not mean! I'm just saying,
she's a fashionable person.

06:40.448 --> 06:43.723
She's giving you '80s, that's...

06:43.725 --> 06:46.253
She must be tired. She
talked the whole way.

06:46.255 --> 06:48.285
You know what? Cheers love.

06:50.635 --> 06:54.821
This is a real, live apple tree.

06:54.823 --> 06:58.143
You can eat right out of this.

06:58.145 --> 06:59.443
I don't think I've ever...

06:59.445 --> 07:02.243
I don't think I've ever
seen an apple tree.

07:02.245 --> 07:03.813
This is gorgeous.

07:03.815 --> 07:05.965
- You are so funny.
- What?

07:08.515 --> 07:10.645
Oh, you gotta see how long
it bugs you. Let me tell you.

07:13.823 --> 07:14.663
You hate bugs.

07:14.665 --> 07:18.253
Yeah, bugs. I like nature, just not...

07:18.255 --> 07:20.485
Not the bugs. They're part of you.

07:22.455 --> 07:24.455
Actually I have a really good bug story.

07:26.155 --> 07:29.245
So my father...

07:29.247 --> 07:31.734
Mio pai. Is that right?

07:31.736 --> 07:34.003
Look at you. You can speak Portuguese.

07:34.005 --> 07:35.433
I did it.

07:35.435 --> 07:38.313
So mio pai.

07:38.315 --> 07:41.775
When he would come back
home from the Amazon,

07:43.045 --> 07:47.212
he would have these larva
basically inside of him.

07:49.015 --> 07:52.683
Because over there they have
these flies that bite you,

07:52.685 --> 07:56.043
and they lay eggs inside of you.

07:56.045 --> 07:58.683
And then you have to wait
until the larva grows

07:58.685 --> 08:00.875
so you can take the
larva out of your body.

08:02.015 --> 08:06.182
So he would put a piece of
ham where the fly had bit him.

08:07.505 --> 08:11.672
And he would see this thing
moving towards the thing.

08:12.610 --> 08:15.893
- And then he would squeeze.
- Ugh!

08:15.895 --> 08:17.669
And the larva would come out.

08:17.671 --> 08:19.844
That's nasty! Gross!

08:19.846 --> 08:22.503
And I would be so embarrassed
because he would do that

08:22.505 --> 08:23.883
when my friends were around.

08:23.885 --> 08:26.073
And I was so embarrassed.

08:26.075 --> 08:28.133
Why in front of your friends?

08:28.135 --> 08:28.983
I don't know. Just the way he is.

08:28.985 --> 08:31.153
I mean, did he know
that it embarrassed you?

08:31.155 --> 08:33.005
Oh yeah. He didn't care about that.

08:33.945 --> 08:35.143
I'm so proud of you.

08:35.145 --> 08:38.075
Oh, baby. Thank you.

08:44.481 --> 08:46.314
I love you.

08:48.155 --> 08:49.255
I love you.

08:50.643 --> 08:52.893
Close your eyes.

08:57.532 --> 09:00.115
- You need to relax.
- I'm trying.

09:01.265 --> 09:02.865
You don't have to try anymore.

09:07.735 --> 09:08.925
Oh, really.

09:11.715 --> 09:12.985
Ooh, this is new.

10:04.819 --> 10:08.652
He's like,
"Left foot. Eh. Oh. Oh."

10:09.968 --> 10:12.541
Oh. That's my favorite.

10:12.543 --> 10:15.213
Aww. He's a cutie.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.973
He's a stupid kid.

10:16.975 --> 10:18.943
He's not a stupid kid.

10:18.945 --> 10:20.913
Yes he's a stupid kid. He's a kid.

10:20.915 --> 10:22.523
Well he's not a stupid kid.

10:22.525 --> 10:23.843
You don't know that he's stupid.

10:23.845 --> 10:27.113
He's just uncoordinated, how about that?

10:27.115 --> 10:29.183
It's a little bit nicer.

10:29.185 --> 10:30.843
All kids are stupid, Claire.

10:30.845 --> 10:32.383
Well kids are not stupid.

10:32.385 --> 10:35.505
They might do stupid things,
but kids are not stupid.

10:36.645 --> 10:37.735
Come on, Claire.

10:39.535 --> 10:42.303
They have an undeveloped brain.

10:42.305 --> 10:44.063
They can't care for themselves.

10:44.065 --> 10:45.543
So that means they're stupid?

10:45.545 --> 10:46.376
Yes.

10:46.378 --> 10:49.543
Okay, so when I care for
you, that means you're stupid?

10:49.545 --> 10:52.185
No, because I can
get up and do whatever.

10:55.145 --> 10:57.675
Claire, stop being
politically correct. Come on.

10:59.345 --> 11:01.653
Because I'm saying
that kids are not stupid?!

11:01.655 --> 11:05.043
They are. It's just a fact.

11:05.045 --> 11:05.876
A fact.

11:05.878 --> 11:09.992
Maybe it's an opinion,
but definitely not a fact.

11:12.635 --> 11:16.243
You were stupid too.
I was stupid, it's okay.

11:16.245 --> 11:19.645
Why stupid? Why that term?

11:21.385 --> 11:22.913
Why not?

11:22.915 --> 11:26.183
Because that's offensive.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.703
You are making it offensive.

11:27.705 --> 11:28.863
It doesn't have to be offensive.

11:28.865 --> 11:30.443
No. That is offensive.

11:30.445 --> 11:32.823
If someone says you're stupid,

11:32.825 --> 11:34.803
would you not be offended by that?

11:34.805 --> 11:36.553
As an adult, yes.

11:36.555 --> 11:37.753
But not as a child?

11:37.755 --> 11:39.555
No, because I wouldn't understand.

11:41.065 --> 11:42.645
Their brains are not developed.

11:44.345 --> 11:47.553
They're stupid, and then once
they get to maybe five or six

11:47.555 --> 11:50.445
they become a little bit
more into being a person.

11:52.465 --> 11:54.313
You wouldn't understand as a kid

11:54.315 --> 11:56.385
if someone told you that you were stupid.

11:57.545 --> 11:58.813
Your brain is not developed.

11:58.815 --> 12:01.553
That doesn't
mean you're stupid!

12:01.555 --> 12:03.063
Yeah.

12:03.065 --> 12:07.232
Honey, your logic is stupid.

12:09.695 --> 12:11.355
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

12:14.350 --> 12:15.673
Do you want some eggs?

12:15.675 --> 12:19.043
Do you want the stupid here
to prepare some eggs for you?

12:19.045 --> 12:20.923
I didn't call you stupid.

12:20.925 --> 12:23.555
I said your logic was
stupid. Don't do that.

12:38.575 --> 12:40.133
You guys just stand up for a second,

12:40.135 --> 12:42.683
because you've been sitting down for...

12:42.685 --> 12:43.675
Stretch it out.

12:46.315 --> 12:48.273
Touch your toes. Just do
whatever you need to do.

12:48.275 --> 12:49.985
Just shake it out so we can...

12:51.705 --> 12:53.225
get some life in your bodies.

12:55.925 --> 12:58.105
Advertising. And that's all it is.

12:59.874 --> 13:01.103
What?

13:01.105 --> 13:03.063
Once you get into the
minds of other people,

13:03.065 --> 13:03.923
that's where the life is.

13:03.925 --> 13:06.825
And that's where the money
is. And that's all there is.

13:07.775 --> 13:09.213
I don't follow you.

13:09.215 --> 13:10.963
Wait wait wait wait.
Go back to advertising.

13:10.965 --> 13:12.958
I love how you're starting.

13:12.960 --> 13:16.583
But let's try... Because he's
like your homie right now.

13:16.585 --> 13:18.663
But I want him to be...

13:18.665 --> 13:21.765
Speak to him like he's a kid,
like he's a five year old.

13:23.295 --> 13:27.462
Advertising.
And that's all it is.

13:28.965 --> 13:30.253
I'm still not following you.

13:30.255 --> 13:32.755
You look at their hair.
You look at their shoes.

13:33.655 --> 13:35.623
And you just hone in on that.

13:35.625 --> 13:39.133
It's almost like he's being intimidated.

13:39.135 --> 13:42.373
And maybe I'm being intimidated.

13:42.375 --> 13:45.523
- You, personally?
- Yeah.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.603
Me, and maybe I'm bringing
that in to the character.

13:47.605 --> 13:49.393
Okay. And that's okay, that's fine.

13:49.395 --> 13:52.483
If that's your honest
reaction right now, bring it.

13:52.485 --> 13:54.953
There's no right or wrong.
We're still in exploration mode.

13:54.955 --> 13:56.173
I have no sympathy for him.

13:56.175 --> 13:58.633
You mean you
can't sympathize with him.

13:58.635 --> 13:59.703
No.

13:59.705 --> 14:00.536
Is that what you're saying?

14:00.538 --> 14:01.643
You cannot sympathize with him?

14:01.645 --> 14:02.843
Yeah.

14:02.845 --> 14:03.678
Okay.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.633
That's definitely a judgment,

14:07.635 --> 14:08.983
because there's nothing in the text

14:08.985 --> 14:10.913
that says he's easily intimidated.

14:10.915 --> 14:14.493
Is that what you wanted? The kind of...

14:14.495 --> 14:17.063
That was definitely better.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.815
We're trying to get through to him.

14:19.915 --> 14:22.033
Yeah, because he's a five year old

14:22.035 --> 14:23.903
who doesn't know anything.

14:23.905 --> 14:25.023
Okay, cool.

14:25.025 --> 14:27.223
Well he's not a five year old

14:27.225 --> 14:28.443
who doesn't know anything.

14:28.445 --> 14:30.308
Yeah yeah yeah, it was
a metaphor. I got you.

14:30.310 --> 14:34.313
Can we maybe play with
the words a little bit?

14:34.315 --> 14:36.343
Instead of being right on the page,

14:36.345 --> 14:37.613
can we lift off the page...

14:37.615 --> 14:38.663
Well, I'll tell you what we can do,

14:38.665 --> 14:41.093
is we can do some improv exercises.

14:41.095 --> 14:42.873
And that maybe can help you guys

14:42.875 --> 14:45.720
get underneath the circumstance
and what's going on.

14:45.722 --> 14:47.423
And can we use your
beautifully written words

14:47.425 --> 14:50.393
as part of the exercise,
or do it in context?

14:50.395 --> 14:52.203
We'll marry the two.

14:52.205 --> 14:53.263
We'll marry the feelings

14:53.265 --> 14:56.573
of what we discover through the improve.

14:56.575 --> 14:59.123
Sir, I need you to focus.

14:59.125 --> 15:00.793
I'm very focused.

15:00.795 --> 15:03.005
I need you to focus on this script.

18:26.475 --> 18:30.283
I'm Monica. I'm staying
over there with my fiance.

18:30.285 --> 18:31.915
Just wanted to come say hi.

18:33.649 --> 18:34.982
- Mutty.
- Mutty?

18:36.485 --> 18:37.935
Two Ts. Mutty.

18:38.925 --> 18:41.445
I like mud, and muddy waters.

18:43.835 --> 18:46.233
Well it's nice to meet you, Mutty.

18:46.235 --> 18:48.133
Is that Irish?

18:48.135 --> 18:50.555
I don't know. American.

18:57.950 --> 18:59.003
Where you from?

18:59.005 --> 19:00.737
We're from New York.

19:00.739 --> 19:03.863
Uh-uh. No, you're not from New York.

19:03.865 --> 19:06.525
I'm from Brazil, but you
know, we live in New York.

19:10.595 --> 19:13.193
- South America.
- Yeah.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.225
Are you nice?

19:19.455 --> 19:20.655
You're staying in there?

19:23.565 --> 19:24.865
Used to be a chicken coop.

19:29.363 --> 19:33.530
500 hens just pissing and
shitting and laying their eggs.

19:36.405 --> 19:37.238
Oh really?

19:38.655 --> 19:40.373
That store bought chicken,

19:40.375 --> 19:43.473
it's like eating straight cancer.

19:43.475 --> 19:47.553
Actually chicken hearts is
a very famous Brazilian dish.

19:47.555 --> 19:48.805
I should make it for you.

19:49.735 --> 19:51.395
Parents don't tell me anything.

19:53.805 --> 19:57.615
They're probably in Pakistan, or Florida.

20:04.275 --> 20:05.193
I didn't want to stop you.

20:05.195 --> 20:07.383
I just wanted to know about

20:07.385 --> 20:09.023
how long you're going to be mowing.

20:09.025 --> 20:11.003
But it's so nice to meet you.

20:11.005 --> 20:12.783
The fishing here is great.

20:12.785 --> 20:15.825
- Yeah?
- Love the fishing here.

20:17.839 --> 20:19.583
And you can tell by the
way they look at you

20:19.585 --> 20:20.785
that they don't feel it.

20:22.545 --> 20:23.855
The worms feel it though.

20:27.435 --> 20:28.685
It's like you being here.

20:30.749 --> 20:33.666
You're a little worm on a big hook.

20:37.464 --> 20:39.631
I'll call you Little Worm.

20:42.402 --> 20:43.950
Well it's nice to meet you.

21:05.855 --> 21:06.835
Two seconds.

21:17.962 --> 21:18.962
- Done?
- Done.

21:20.625 --> 21:22.175
So how was your day?

21:23.735 --> 21:27.463
It was what I expected.
They didn't quite get it.

21:27.465 --> 21:31.653
I want truth, and truth
is not always pretty.

21:31.655 --> 21:33.943
That's just the point
that I'm trying to make.

21:33.945 --> 21:36.723
Like, not everybody is
introduced into your life

21:36.725 --> 21:38.143
into a positive way.

21:38.145 --> 21:40.783
Yes I understand that
it's easier, I get that.

21:40.785 --> 21:43.783
But that's not always
how it goes down in life.

21:43.785 --> 21:45.555
They didn't quite get it.

21:46.875 --> 21:51.042
And I think one of them is a little...

21:55.405 --> 21:57.155
This guy has been mowing all day.

21:58.405 --> 22:01.335
Okay. Well, just ask him to stop.

22:02.587 --> 22:03.837
Or let him mow.

22:08.115 --> 22:09.115
It's been all day.

22:11.335 --> 22:13.803
He is a little strange.

22:13.805 --> 22:16.073
Is that his job, or something?

22:16.075 --> 22:19.123
I don't know. His
name is Mutty, I guess.

22:19.125 --> 22:20.883
I talked to him really fast.

22:20.885 --> 22:22.105
He's like, Mutty.

22:23.995 --> 22:27.875
Well, I mean, I guess he's
the keeper of the grounds.

22:28.874 --> 22:30.291
Just let him mow.

22:36.225 --> 22:37.935
- He spoke to you before?
- Yeah.

22:41.486 --> 22:44.343
Like he was really close to the house,

22:44.345 --> 22:45.945
like really close to the window.

22:47.035 --> 22:48.795
I could've been talking on the phone.

22:49.855 --> 22:50.755
This is crazy.

22:53.965 --> 22:54.796
Okay.

22:54.798 --> 22:56.555
I can't hear you. I can't...

23:02.955 --> 23:03.805
You okay?

23:07.972 --> 23:12.139
I don't know why I'm
thinking about this, but...

23:13.065 --> 23:14.095
When I was a kid

23:18.645 --> 23:20.515
my uncle's daughter got kidnapped.

23:24.957 --> 23:27.683
And it was really weird,

23:27.685 --> 23:31.852
because I had to stay home

23:33.084 --> 23:36.501
for the entire time until they found her.

23:37.625 --> 23:38.463
Because we... I don't know.

23:38.465 --> 23:40.093
I don't know if they were scared

23:40.095 --> 23:42.565
that we would get kidnapped, or...

23:44.175 --> 23:48.953
It was the first time that I
ever was afraid of something,

23:48.955 --> 23:52.155
and that I understood what fear means.

23:55.665 --> 23:59.115
And then just feeling
afraid inside of your house.

24:00.585 --> 24:02.423
You know, like my parents were there,

24:02.425 --> 24:04.443
my grandmother was there, and my brother.

24:04.445 --> 24:07.635
But I didn't feel safe.

24:10.809 --> 24:13.983
I feel like that changed me forever.

24:13.985 --> 24:15.285
Yeah? Like how?

24:16.883 --> 24:19.603
When you're in a house
you're supposed to feel safe

24:19.605 --> 24:21.255
and comfortable with your family.

24:23.015 --> 24:25.145
But then my uncle

24:27.935 --> 24:31.203
was able to get the police
to work in cooperation

24:31.205 --> 24:34.325
and they found her in another city.

24:37.734 --> 24:40.401
And she was fine. She said that.

24:41.815 --> 24:42.646
It's really weird.

24:42.648 --> 24:46.652
They were giving her steaks, and popcorn,

24:48.015 --> 24:49.845
and letting her watch movies.

24:50.805 --> 24:52.455
Who were these people?

24:54.375 --> 24:55.375
They wanted money.

25:00.014 --> 25:03.493
She was missing for like a month.

25:03.495 --> 25:04.885
Oh my God.

25:05.855 --> 25:07.875
And then my uncle gave a car to

25:09.154 --> 25:12.237
all the police people that found her.

25:13.275 --> 25:14.175
It's just weird.

25:16.639 --> 25:20.806
That's kind of how I feel
here. I don't feel safe.

25:21.865 --> 25:22.773
Honey...

25:22.775 --> 25:25.083
But there's no reason to not be safe.

25:25.085 --> 25:27.945
No, we're fine. We're fine.

25:29.454 --> 25:33.621
You're a grown woman. You
know what to do if you feel...

25:35.978 --> 25:37.603
I can't explain.

25:37.605 --> 25:39.813
It feels different.

25:39.815 --> 25:41.435
That's it. Go to bed.

27:24.865 --> 27:26.826
Looks like we had the same idea.

27:26.828 --> 27:28.161
You scared me.

27:31.740 --> 27:34.253
You should go get your
friend. What's her name?

27:34.255 --> 27:37.105
Claire? She's too tired.

27:38.465 --> 27:40.048
She worked all day.

27:41.465 --> 27:43.855
I would bet she's never
worked a day in her life.

27:47.989 --> 27:49.489
It's so hot out.

27:53.242 --> 27:54.075
Indeed.

28:06.145 --> 28:08.623
You and Claire should come
to the house for dinner.

28:08.625 --> 28:09.765
I have a lot of wine.

28:11.992 --> 28:13.725
I don't think so.

28:13.727 --> 28:16.250
You can come tomorrow.

30:51.635 --> 30:52.835
Get in there.

30:54.838 --> 30:56.088
Closer. Closer.

30:57.065 --> 30:58.563
Oh God. All right.

30:58.565 --> 30:59.933
All right, all right, all right.

30:59.935 --> 31:01.113
I've had these conversations.

31:01.115 --> 31:02.083
Maybe not with a hug,

31:02.085 --> 31:04.473
but I've had these
conversations in my life before.

31:04.475 --> 31:05.813
So I like it.

31:05.815 --> 31:06.715
How do I put it?

31:08.385 --> 31:10.533
It's not just the tribalistic stuff.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.573
And you're just getting
the tribalistic stuff.

31:12.575 --> 31:14.353
Yeah, you're right, I've had
this conversation before,

31:14.355 --> 31:18.013
with idiots, because they're
stupid, and wrong, and moronic.

31:18.015 --> 31:19.763
But you know this guy.

31:19.765 --> 31:22.653
We just said you've met guys like this.

31:22.655 --> 31:23.495
Yeah.

31:24.416 --> 31:28.952
I mean, I'm not
in love with Marcus either.

31:28.954 --> 31:31.453
I don't want to say my heroes
always have to be passive,

31:31.455 --> 31:33.783
and for the better of everyone,

31:33.785 --> 31:35.593
and your heroes get to fire rockets.

31:35.595 --> 31:38.673
We have been genocided. Constantly.

31:38.675 --> 31:41.233
That's all our history.
That's all we're told.

31:41.235 --> 31:43.123
But I don't think it's about

31:43.125 --> 31:45.073
all white people or all black people.

31:45.075 --> 31:47.485
In this play it's you and me.

31:48.431 --> 31:50.373
Is that right, Claire?

31:50.375 --> 31:54.542
Listen, these two guys can
be judgmental with each other.

31:56.245 --> 32:00.293
And in that truth they can give
each other space to change.

32:00.295 --> 32:01.245
That's what I want.

32:25.031 --> 32:27.781
- It's Mutty.
- What does he want?

32:29.805 --> 32:31.138
Cool. Come in.

32:32.015 --> 32:33.583
Dig what I said.

32:33.585 --> 32:36.385
Got us dinner. Rainbow trout.

32:37.585 --> 32:38.785
Dinner. Okay.

32:39.681 --> 32:42.681
We can do chicken instead.

32:43.805 --> 32:46.495
I should bring it back to the farm.

32:47.945 --> 32:52.112
They have a tendency to blame
me when they go missing.

32:54.655 --> 32:55.635
They blame me.

32:58.045 --> 32:59.189
You said tonight.

32:59.191 --> 33:01.191
I didn't say anything.

33:02.056 --> 33:04.056
Yeah, I know. You did.

33:07.335 --> 33:08.455
It's fine, baby.

33:10.055 --> 33:13.055
I'll see you guys tonight.

33:14.805 --> 33:15.636
You said.

33:15.638 --> 33:17.453
I don't know what he's talking about.

33:17.455 --> 33:20.803
I have not spoken to
this guy. This is weird.

33:20.805 --> 33:22.373
I think it's really sweet.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.733
When am I
gonna have time with you?

33:24.735 --> 33:26.673
We'll have time with each other.

33:26.675 --> 33:27.993
No, I don't have time with you.

33:27.995 --> 33:31.039
Yes. Right now we have time, right now.

33:31.041 --> 33:33.041
We have time, right now.

33:39.345 --> 33:41.273
Need a good, sharp knife.

33:41.275 --> 33:43.723
Stick it in the shitter.

33:43.725 --> 33:45.925
Run it up the gut. Pull them out.

33:48.325 --> 33:49.158
There you go.

33:52.785 --> 33:55.105
You have a really nice tent over here.

33:55.955 --> 33:58.305
That's my house.
That's where I stay.

33:59.385 --> 34:02.445
- It's safe in there.
- What do you mean?

34:03.494 --> 34:07.661
Hidey hole and tiny spaces
keeps away the ugly faces.

34:09.985 --> 34:12.277
You know what I mean.

34:12.279 --> 34:15.678
I don't know what you mean.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.313
Mutty, did you make that up?

34:17.315 --> 34:19.733
- No.
- No?

34:19.735 --> 34:23.415
You like that, right?
Fish heads down south.

34:35.034 --> 34:36.985
It's good for me to have you here.

34:38.045 --> 34:41.045
For my development I'm supposed
to be nice with people.

34:55.594 --> 35:00.093
I can change the music. I have Chopin.

35:00.095 --> 35:02.273
Chopin is good by me.

35:02.275 --> 35:04.128
They have Chopin in Brazil?

35:04.130 --> 35:04.961
I thought all they had down there

35:04.963 --> 35:07.175
was jungle beat and sex music.

35:08.735 --> 35:11.383
It's a very developed country.

35:11.385 --> 35:14.185
Compared to other
third world countries.

35:15.165 --> 35:17.155
It really is developed.

35:19.043 --> 35:22.373
You should go there. I'm
sure people would love you.

35:22.375 --> 35:23.885
I don't want to go there.

35:25.835 --> 35:30.002
Too much corruption, and too
easy to get kidnapped there.

35:31.025 --> 35:34.015
There's corruption and
kidnapping in every city.

35:34.915 --> 35:35.815
Every country.

35:37.830 --> 35:39.663
That's true.

35:53.905 --> 35:55.605
So when are you gonna get hitched?

35:58.215 --> 35:59.675
Um...

36:02.975 --> 36:03.853
What's so funny?

36:03.855 --> 36:06.575
Well, just that he brought it up, but...

36:08.245 --> 36:11.565
Okay. Marriage.

36:13.635 --> 36:14.935
Boundary issues?

36:18.485 --> 36:20.515
We don't have
any boundary issues.

36:22.125 --> 36:24.765
Well I don't want to talk about...

36:27.875 --> 36:30.652
Have you ever been married?

36:30.654 --> 36:31.487
Once.

36:33.965 --> 36:36.295
Do you mind talking about that?

36:39.918 --> 36:43.168
I met her at the end of Desert Storm.

36:45.082 --> 36:47.165
I had five guys under me.

36:49.892 --> 36:53.142
We were in charge of the scud launcher.

36:55.005 --> 36:55.838
Scud?

36:59.525 --> 37:03.455
Stingers. Stinger launcher.

37:10.245 --> 37:11.575
We would get orders.

37:13.467 --> 37:16.391
How it works is a matter of dest...

37:16.393 --> 37:19.973
The target destination
is measured in clicks.

37:19.975 --> 37:21.341
Someone would count.

37:21.343 --> 37:24.573
They'd count Mississippi, one Mississippi.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.875
I counted in clicks.

37:30.332 --> 37:31.665
It was at night.

37:35.194 --> 37:36.944
And we had the order.

37:38.195 --> 37:41.545
And then the confirmation came in.

37:43.065 --> 37:44.585
Seven clicks was the target.

37:47.625 --> 37:52.523
And when them things go
off, it's like nothing else.

37:52.525 --> 37:56.803
It would suck the life,
the air right out of you,

37:56.805 --> 37:58.275
watching them fire off.

38:01.175 --> 38:04.255
Seven clicks, counted.

38:05.625 --> 38:08.955
Five, six clicks.

38:09.893 --> 38:13.976
The whole fuckin' sky lit
up like it was daytime.

38:18.857 --> 38:20.573
I don't get it.

38:20.575 --> 38:22.493
I think he's saying that...

38:22.495 --> 38:23.633
You wouldn't get it.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.503
They got to six,

38:25.505 --> 38:26.523
and they were supposed to get to seven

38:26.525 --> 38:28.915
so they didn't hit the right target.

38:32.857 --> 38:35.190
It was a residential area.

38:36.245 --> 38:39.185
Schools, mosques, a hospital.

38:46.615 --> 38:48.015
- It happened to you?
- No.

38:53.267 --> 38:55.017
- No?
- No, it didn't.

38:56.995 --> 38:58.645
I was just trying to impress you.

39:03.135 --> 39:06.353
- It's late.
- Yeah, it's late.

39:06.355 --> 39:07.723
You should go.

39:07.725 --> 39:11.865
I'm a little tipsy,
so yeah. But thank you.

39:18.675 --> 39:22.463
I'm sorry, I'm too drunk. We'll head home.

39:22.465 --> 39:24.855
- Bye.
- Thank you. Bye bye.

39:25.705 --> 39:27.205
- I appreciate it.
- Bye bye.

39:30.395 --> 39:32.695
Thank you again. Good night.

39:38.765 --> 39:41.613
I just didn't want to
talk about it with him.

39:41.615 --> 39:44.773
You avoid
the question every time.

39:44.775 --> 39:47.683
Monica! Because I
don't want to talk about it

39:47.685 --> 39:49.781
while I'm here doing business.

39:49.783 --> 39:51.431
It's never a good time.

39:51.433 --> 39:53.453
It's always on your terms, Claire!

39:53.455 --> 39:54.545
Yeah, right now it is.

40:07.875 --> 40:12.042
I'm just gonna stay here,
and I'm gonna watch your show.

40:13.519 --> 40:16.523
Stop it!
Stop acting like a baby!

40:16.525 --> 40:18.615
Stop it! I'm sick of it!

40:19.665 --> 40:23.832
I'm sick of this bullshit!
What the fuck do you want?

40:26.295 --> 40:28.633
I want you to be my family.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.341
I am your family!

40:30.343 --> 40:31.673
You're not, because you just

40:31.675 --> 40:33.815
think about your fucking work.

40:40.305 --> 40:41.793
I don't even
know how to reason with you

40:41.795 --> 40:45.073
right now because you're
fucking drunk, and crying.

40:45.075 --> 40:47.633
No I'm not. You never talk to me.

40:47.635 --> 40:49.815
Because I'm fucking working!

40:53.145 --> 40:55.185
Monica. Monica.

40:56.515 --> 40:58.813
Stop crying!

40:58.815 --> 41:00.148
Monica, stop it!

41:01.055 --> 41:04.133
Why do you have to always be so selfish!

41:04.135 --> 41:06.967
What you're doing is self-centered!

41:06.969 --> 41:08.263
You just don't want me.

41:08.265 --> 41:11.533
You just want your fucking
theater, and your fucking art!

41:11.535 --> 41:14.681
And I don't fucking
matter, and I'm no one!

41:14.683 --> 41:17.933
And no one ever fucking cares about me!

41:20.033 --> 41:22.981
- No fucking one!
- Stop it.

41:22.983 --> 41:27.031
You don't care. You have all
these people that love you.

41:27.033 --> 41:28.866
I have no fucking one!

41:30.133 --> 41:32.404
You have a fucking family

41:32.406 --> 41:34.754
and you don't want to
be what I fucking want!

41:34.756 --> 41:36.681
Stop it! Stop it!

41:36.683 --> 41:37.691
Stop it you!

41:37.693 --> 41:40.729
You stop it. Stop it.

41:44.530 --> 41:47.433
No I don't wanna fucking
deal with your shit

41:47.435 --> 41:50.543
when I can't fucking get through to you!

41:50.545 --> 41:52.423
Because you're drunk!

41:52.425 --> 41:55.043
I don't want to deal with that shit.

41:55.045 --> 41:58.255
Monica, I am here trying to fucking work!

41:59.365 --> 42:03.125
Can you not understand that! Look at me!

42:03.985 --> 42:07.717
Why do you want to make me act like this?

42:07.719 --> 42:09.804
Stop it. Stop it.

42:09.806 --> 42:11.223
Stop it. Stop it.

42:13.379 --> 42:15.962
Get your fucking shit together.

45:21.324 --> 45:22.157
Monica.

45:31.945 --> 45:33.095
I have to go to work.

45:38.065 --> 45:41.775
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

45:45.265 --> 45:47.983
- I drank too much.
- I know.

45:47.985 --> 45:49.235
What happened?

45:51.587 --> 45:52.920
We had dinner...

45:54.575 --> 45:56.375
I'm not feeling good.

45:57.265 --> 45:58.303
I don't want
to leave you like this,

45:58.305 --> 46:00.235
but I've got to go.

46:03.660 --> 46:05.660
I'll be fine.

49:11.955 --> 49:14.150
I haven't gotten laid in a year.

49:14.152 --> 49:17.093
There's been times
where I haven't banged girls.

49:17.095 --> 49:19.723
Yeah, but there was
times when you did. A lot.

49:19.725 --> 49:21.998
Jerk off, man. We all do.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.917
Can we just...

49:25.185 --> 49:27.053
This guy is ridiculous.

49:27.055 --> 49:30.763
Please. I'm not interested
in your judgment right now.

49:30.765 --> 49:33.013
Okay? Let's just keep moving.

49:33.015 --> 49:36.111
But you've got a Lothario
and a twerp, and it's like...

49:36.113 --> 49:38.463
That is your judgment!

49:38.465 --> 49:40.348
You want us to be
ourselves, you want us...

49:40.350 --> 49:43.903
Guys, we don't have time for this!

49:43.905 --> 49:46.696
You're the one making
the judgment in the text!

49:46.698 --> 49:49.463
I'm not making any judgment!

49:49.465 --> 49:51.743
Hey guys, let's just take a break.

49:51.745 --> 49:53.523
We're just trying to find it.

49:53.525 --> 49:55.483
You wanted us to improv
today, that's what we did.

49:55.485 --> 49:58.283
Maybe we're in a place
because we improved all day.

49:58.285 --> 50:00.761
We played around a lot, we
worked really hard today.

50:00.763 --> 50:04.083
You know, maybe we're at
the end of it right now.

50:04.085 --> 50:06.133
You guys are fine, I just...

50:06.135 --> 50:09.263
No no no. You're fine, we're all fine.

50:09.265 --> 50:10.098
I'm sorry.

50:11.702 --> 50:14.452
How about if we go get a drink?

50:17.075 --> 50:18.795
Come on. You know you want to.

51:36.162 --> 51:38.912
- Oh, whoa. Whoa whoa.
- I'm fine.

51:42.595 --> 51:44.161
- Do you want me to drive?
- No.

51:44.163 --> 51:45.961
I don't think you can
drive. You can drive?

51:45.963 --> 51:47.293
- I'm fine.
- You're sure?

51:47.295 --> 51:49.998
- Yes, I'm good.
- I can take you.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.721
You don't look tired. You
don't even look tired.

51:53.723 --> 51:55.161
You better watch yourself.

51:55.163 --> 51:57.496
You don't even look tired.

52:04.795 --> 52:05.873
I was so excited.

52:05.875 --> 52:10.713
And I knew I was somewhere
else, just by the smell.

52:10.715 --> 52:14.803
It was so... I don't know,
it was otherworldly.

52:14.805 --> 52:17.215
I can't even describe how...

52:18.575 --> 52:20.805
It was like the breath
of God, or something.

52:22.575 --> 52:26.035
I did not think to ask
them if they had a phone.

52:28.275 --> 52:30.445
We started talking, we had drinks.

52:31.675 --> 52:32.905
God, you're selfish.

52:34.205 --> 52:36.055
It's 3:00 in the morning.

52:42.565 --> 52:45.648
There was no phone. I swear. I swear.

52:49.315 --> 52:51.945
You think you could live
in a place like this forever?

52:53.535 --> 52:57.702
I don't know. Maybe, maybe
when I get older I could.

53:00.045 --> 53:00.878
Not much to do.

53:03.125 --> 53:05.803
It just would be weird at the winter.

53:05.805 --> 53:07.273
Oh yeah.

53:07.275 --> 53:09.953
I would definitely be down

53:09.955 --> 53:13.949
to be in someplace that's
warm all year round.

53:13.951 --> 53:16.034
Oh really? Like Brazil?

53:18.138 --> 53:20.888
- That's warm.
- I could live there.

54:58.171 --> 55:00.254
Peter? It's me.

55:01.798 --> 55:02.631
Mutty.

55:46.619 --> 55:49.619
Little Worm, I know you're in there.

55:53.858 --> 55:55.441
The door is locked.

55:57.308 --> 55:59.183
Do you need a key? I have a key.

55:59.185 --> 56:01.505
I have my keys! Just
leave me alone please!

56:02.555 --> 56:03.583
We need to have a talk.

56:03.585 --> 56:05.805
I don't want to talk.
Just leave me alone!

56:07.805 --> 56:09.233
There's a
place for wine bottles.

56:09.235 --> 56:11.293
I found a wine bottle.
There's a place for them.

56:11.295 --> 56:12.425
It's the green bin.

56:13.596 --> 56:16.429
Okay!

56:17.345 --> 56:20.325
I have rules. You
have to follow them as well.

56:21.695 --> 56:25.005
Just stop messing
with me! Leave me alone!

56:29.519 --> 56:30.352
Fine.

56:39.485 --> 56:42.233
I gotta go to the mechanic.
Do you wanna go with me?

56:42.235 --> 56:44.568
No! Just go away! Go away!

58:03.805 --> 58:04.905
Anyone home?

58:21.470 --> 58:23.387
I know you can hear me.

58:27.395 --> 58:29.485
Why can't we have a beer together?

58:46.532 --> 58:48.243
The problem is that
he comes into the place

58:48.245 --> 58:49.285
when I'm not there.

58:50.891 --> 58:53.663
And I'm not safe. I don't feel good.

58:53.665 --> 58:56.203
Who? Who comes in to your place?

58:56.205 --> 58:57.103
Mutty.

58:57.105 --> 59:01.203
He's the gentleman that's been
taking care of the property.

59:01.205 --> 59:02.380
Mutty?

59:02.382 --> 59:03.263
Mutty.

59:03.265 --> 59:06.535
He is harmless, so, good.

59:09.230 --> 59:11.053
How do we know he's harmless?

59:11.055 --> 59:12.893
Is there a problem?
Seriously, is there a problem?

59:12.895 --> 59:13.923
It's okay. It's okay, guys.

59:13.925 --> 59:15.483
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

59:15.485 --> 59:17.115
It's fine. I'm sorry.

59:19.745 --> 59:20.578
Hey.

59:30.105 --> 59:31.455
So you're our cook tonight?

59:35.945 --> 59:37.533
South American hearts.

59:37.535 --> 59:39.903
- That sounds gross.
- It's actually really good.

59:39.905 --> 59:41.183
- Really, you've had these?
- Yeah.

59:41.185 --> 59:42.643
You like chicken hearts.

59:42.645 --> 59:45.453
- I do. I've told you that.
- I never knew that before.

59:45.455 --> 59:46.693
You just don't listen, Claire.

59:46.695 --> 59:48.333
So then what's the problem?

59:48.335 --> 59:50.073
Nothing. There's no problem.

59:50.075 --> 59:52.073
Well I don't know about hearts,
but I've had tripe before.

59:52.075 --> 59:53.515
- You had tripe?
- Bigger.

59:53.517 --> 59:55.600
I've had pig's testicles.

59:57.015 --> 59:58.763
- You have not.
- Yes I have.

59:58.765 --> 01:00:00.703
- You have not.
- I have indeed.

01:00:00.705 --> 01:00:01.536
You have not.

01:00:01.538 --> 01:00:03.523
I can tell you, it does
not taste like chicken,

01:00:03.525 --> 01:00:04.543
if that's what you're wondering.

01:00:04.545 --> 01:00:05.703
I am.

01:00:05.705 --> 01:00:07.277
Yeah, it's not chicken.

01:00:07.279 --> 01:00:10.253
When it's put in front
of you it's like, "What?"

01:00:10.255 --> 01:00:11.653
And then you taste it.

01:00:11.655 --> 01:00:14.103
It's creepy because, you're
biting your own balls.

01:00:14.105 --> 01:00:16.193
That's what it feels like.
That's the texture, everything.

01:00:16.195 --> 01:00:17.263
Oh God. You're killing me.

01:00:17.265 --> 01:00:19.575
It's like tripe, but balls.

01:00:21.128 --> 01:00:22.133
Chitlins. You know what chitlins are.

01:00:22.135 --> 01:00:24.365
Yes, I do.

01:00:25.615 --> 01:00:27.527
Did you ever actually eat them?

01:00:27.529 --> 01:00:30.666
No. Ew, the smell. I could
never get past the smell.

01:00:30.668 --> 01:00:32.803
I could not get it past there.

01:00:32.805 --> 01:00:34.263
Is it like haggis or something?

01:00:34.265 --> 01:00:35.353
It's nothing like haggis.

01:00:35.355 --> 01:00:36.793
What is haggis?

01:00:36.795 --> 01:00:37.626
You don't want to know what haggis is.

01:00:37.628 --> 01:00:40.090
- It's wonderful.
- Now I want to know.

01:00:40.092 --> 01:00:42.053
- It's not wonderful.
- What it is?

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:43.790
Some things, when a man
tells you something is

01:00:43.792 --> 01:00:46.453
leave it alone, you leave it alone.

01:00:46.455 --> 01:00:47.813
It's corn beef hash but better.

01:00:47.815 --> 01:00:51.063
It's not corn beef
hash at all. Trust me.

01:00:51.065 --> 01:00:53.263
I'll take your word for it.

01:00:53.265 --> 01:00:54.173
You're gonna take my word for it?

01:00:54.175 --> 01:00:56.365
Oh, easy.

01:00:57.828 --> 01:00:59.543
- You, you.
- Yes, me.

01:00:59.545 --> 01:01:00.376
You're funny.

01:01:00.378 --> 01:01:02.613
You better
watch out for this one.

01:01:02.615 --> 01:01:04.243
I don't know why, but I do trust you.

01:01:04.245 --> 01:01:06.213
- You absolutely should.
- Why?

01:01:06.215 --> 01:01:07.813
- I know the reason.
- Why?

01:01:07.815 --> 01:01:09.828
What are you doing on Christmas?

01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:11.193
Whoa, that was a jump.

01:01:11.195 --> 01:01:13.113
Well I mean my grandmother
still makes chitlins.

01:01:13.115 --> 01:01:14.453
I'm sheltered from the chitlins.

01:01:14.455 --> 01:01:16.395
But you should come to the
house. Both of you should come.

01:01:16.397 --> 01:01:17.603
That would be sweet.

01:01:17.605 --> 01:01:18.603
We're actually going
to Brazil for Christmas.

01:01:18.605 --> 01:01:20.923
- Brazil.
- That sounds fun.

01:01:20.925 --> 01:01:23.533
That sounds a lot of fun.
They have thongs there.

01:01:23.535 --> 01:01:24.366
Easy.

01:01:24.368 --> 01:01:27.193
There's something about
seeing your director in a thong

01:01:27.195 --> 01:01:30.141
that changes everything
about your direction.

01:01:30.143 --> 01:01:32.018
I know that that little smile

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.903
has probably caused a lot of trouble.

01:01:33.905 --> 01:01:34.973
No trouble at all.

01:01:34.975 --> 01:01:37.173
- Do you wear thongs?
- I don't.

01:01:37.175 --> 01:01:38.093
You don't?

01:01:38.095 --> 01:01:40.063
They always got the
wrong ones in the thongs.

01:01:40.065 --> 01:01:41.791
You seem like the right one.

01:01:41.793 --> 01:01:43.393
I'm learning a lot about you right now.

01:01:43.395 --> 01:01:44.475
You're cut off.

01:01:47.233 --> 01:01:49.517
I'm so tired of you. You're killing me.

01:01:49.519 --> 01:01:51.263
I asked you today to leave me alone.

01:01:51.265 --> 01:01:54.405
You keep coming around.
You need to leave me alone.

01:01:54.407 --> 01:01:56.129
You need to stop.

01:01:56.131 --> 01:01:59.155
You keep living here. You
don't want to leave me alone.

01:01:59.157 --> 01:02:00.480
You're being ugly.

01:02:02.623 --> 01:02:04.481
I'm sorry. Mutty, I'm sorry.

01:02:04.483 --> 01:02:05.523
I can fix it.

01:02:05.525 --> 01:02:06.356
She'll be okay.

01:02:06.358 --> 01:02:08.405
You guys, don't touch the coals, okay?

01:02:09.483 --> 01:02:11.781
I can fix this. I can fix this.

01:02:11.783 --> 01:02:12.873
I can fix it.

01:02:12.875 --> 01:02:14.833
Are we getting in
the pool today or what?

01:02:14.835 --> 01:02:17.505
It's a good time for that
thong, Claire. You coming?

01:02:17.507 --> 01:02:19.174
You coming? Come on.

01:02:20.645 --> 01:02:22.425
My dad is gonna be really angry.

01:02:29.005 --> 01:02:32.922
I thought this would be
nice food for you guys.

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:39.447
My dad is gonna be really angry.

01:03:44.836 --> 01:03:47.419
You can't see! You can't see!

01:04:31.823 --> 01:04:32.656
Mutty.

01:04:34.173 --> 01:04:35.478
Hey Mutty.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.730
Hey buddy, how you doing?

01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:40.218
- Hey Rocky.
- You remember me, huh?

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.138
Huh?

01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:43.684
- The family okay?
- I'm okay.

01:04:43.686 --> 01:04:44.853
No problems?

01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:49.528
Hey listen, I got a
small situation up here

01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:51.158
I was hoping you could help me with.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.408
Could you help me out with something?

01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:53.458
I can help you.

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:54.758
Why don't you come up here with me.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.661
We got a little situation

01:04:56.663 --> 01:05:00.248
with some people you may or may not know.

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:01.708
Like maybe some girls.

01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:02.728
I talked to the girls.

01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:04.378
You talked to some girls.

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:06.088
That was a good conversation?

01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:06.958
I gave them dinner.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.008
You gave them dinner.

01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:09.747
How did you give them dinner?

01:05:09.749 --> 01:05:12.158
With food, and with wine.

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.040
Can you do me a favor, Mutty?

01:05:14.886 --> 01:05:16.388
Can you just step over here for a second?

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:18.298
I gotta go talk to some of these people.

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:19.278
I didn't do anything bad.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.111
I know you didn't.

01:05:20.113 --> 01:05:21.658
You've always been good, right?

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:22.778
Why don't you wait right here

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:24.530
while I talk to these people, okay?

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:34.798
Hey. What's going on?

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.428
I called the cops.

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:37.890
- What?
- I called the cops.

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.908
- Afternoon ladies.
- Hi sir.

01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:42.448
- How we doing?
- Good, and you?

01:05:42.450 --> 01:05:44.968
I'm Officer Scarboro. I'm
with the police department.

01:05:44.970 --> 01:05:47.138
Somebody made a complaint.
I don't know which...

01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:48.948
- You? Your name, ma'am?
- Monica.

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:49.783
Monica.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.318
I just drove up here
and I saw this young man

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.048
down here picking berries or something.

01:05:55.050 --> 01:05:56.988
I don't know if he's
involved in any part of it.

01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.821
- But his name is Mutty.
- Mhm.

01:05:57.823 --> 01:06:00.060
And exactly what did he do to you?

01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:03.908
Ouch.

01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:06.018
Did he sexually abuse you in any way,

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:07.660
or grope you, or anything?

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.171
No.

01:06:10.173 --> 01:06:11.128
- He didn't.
- No.

01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:12.348
What do you
think he was trying to do

01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:13.795
when he grabbed you?

01:06:13.797 --> 01:06:15.508
He's been harassing me
for the past few weeks.

01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:17.168
- He has been.
- Yes.

01:06:17.170 --> 01:06:19.518
We're not
gonna have that happen.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:22.888
I know him, I know his family,
but I know he has problems.

01:06:22.890 --> 01:06:25.668
He might be acting out. I
don't know what he's doing.

01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:29.228
But I know he hasn't been a problem.

01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:31.558
As you can imagine,
somebody with Asperger's

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:34.708
probably has some real issues
dealing with this world.

01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:38.708
In any case, I'm not happy
with this bruising on your arm.

01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:40.918
We can handle this in one of two ways.

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.320
I can bring him home,
which I'm gonna do anyhow.

01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:46.260
Talk to his father, and his mother.

01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:49.558
And make sure he doesn't cross that fence

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.058
and come over here anymore.

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.410
Or we could summons him to court.

01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:55.891
It's up to you.

01:06:55.893 --> 01:06:57.750
If you want him being brought to court,

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.848
he'll go before a magistrate or a judge

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:03.928
and they'll determine what further things

01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:05.538
should be done with him.

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:08.348
But it's up to you, it's
ultimately up to you.

01:07:08.350 --> 01:07:10.898
I think we should just
get him to his family,

01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:11.858
handle it that way.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.448
I don't want to go
through any court system.

01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:15.490
Is that okay by you?

01:07:17.223 --> 01:07:18.054
I want to take him to court.

01:07:18.056 --> 01:07:20.550
Why don't you allow me to take him home.

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:22.918
And I'll speak to his father.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.859
I'll walk him off the
property, speak to his father,

01:07:25.861 --> 01:07:29.468
and hopefully it doesn't happen again.

01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:30.438
There's one thing, Monica.

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:34.558
Remember the saying, "There
for the sake of God go I."

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:35.760
Everybody needs a break.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.433
You decide.

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:46.578
You want to take him to court.

01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:47.718
Yes.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.821
Okay. You're sure
you want to take him to court.

01:07:49.823 --> 01:07:50.671
Yes.

01:07:50.673 --> 01:07:52.298
It's your
decision, not anybody else.

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:53.408
I know she's being a good friend,

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:54.718
but it's your decision to make.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:55.730
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:58.658
You're gonna get something in the mail.

01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:00.710
Appear in court a certain time and place.

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.747
Thanks for waiting here, buddy.

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:08.398
I appreciate you waiting here.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.338
Did you say you were nice to those girls?

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:12.458
- I was nice with them.
- You were nice to them.

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.578
You didn't touch them,
you didn't hurt them?

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:15.478
You were nice to them.

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:16.868
I know that. I did not.

01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:18.768
Did you say anything to them?

01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:19.798
We were nice together.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.580
You were nice together. Okay.

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:25.718
We're gonna have to deal with that, okay.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:26.598
I didn't do anything bad.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.618
I know you didn't. I know.

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:29.178
I've known you for a long time.

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.287
I know that I
didn't do anything bad, Rocky.

01:08:31.290 --> 01:08:33.398
Well listen, right now
we're gonna have to go

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:34.368
up your father's house.

01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:36.188
I'm gonna ask you to leave the property.

01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:37.328
- I didn't do anything.
- I know you didn't.

01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:40.558
But we're still gonna have to go, okay?

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:43.688
We'll go up to your parents,
and I'll talk to them,

01:08:43.689 --> 01:08:45.948
and everything is gonna be fine. Okay?

01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:47.417
I didn't do anything bad, Rocky.

01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:48.337
Well I didn't think you would.

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:50.049
I've known you for a long time.

01:08:50.051 --> 01:08:54.287
Maybe there's just a
misunderstanding, right?

01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:56.508
It could be a misunderstanding.

01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:57.858
But in any case, I'm gonna ask you

01:08:57.859 --> 01:08:59.948
to stay away from this house for a while.

01:08:59.950 --> 01:09:01.750
This is my dad's property.

01:09:02.935 --> 01:09:03.978
That may be so,

01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:05.877
but you're gonna have to
stay away from this building.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.758
I need my bags.

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.457
Okay, we'll get those too. Okay?

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:11.888
Okay Mutty?

01:09:11.890 --> 01:09:13.908
- Your father home?
- No.

01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:17.318
- Your father's not home?
- No. Florida.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.707
All right, well
we can still handle this.

01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:22.319
You're not gonna go back to
this house though, right?

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:36.899
Go. Sing.

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:41.160
It was kinda nuts. Are we
not gonna talk about that?

01:09:42.290 --> 01:09:44.667
That was a night at the house, yeah.

01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:45.501
I don't know.

01:09:45.502 --> 01:09:48.298
- Is your girl all right?
- Yeah. She's good now.

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:49.747
Yeah.

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:52.098
That was kinda nuts. Is he still around?

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.638
No, we haven't
seen him. Everything is cool.

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.448
That doesn't mean he's not still around.

01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:57.288
No, he's not around.

01:09:57.290 --> 01:10:01.558
No mowing, no gifts, no nothing.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.638
We have not seen him,
and I'm good with that.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.878
- Claire, he was weird.
- I know. I know.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.808
No, but like for real weird.

01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:10.770
Like weird.

01:10:12.003 --> 01:10:14.858
Like Michael Meyers weird.

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:17.058
You mean not the
comedian. The other guy.

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:19.258
Definitely not the comedian.
It wasn't really funny.

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:21.448
I don't know what you
guys are freaking out about.

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:24.090
Honestly, he's just a guy.

01:10:56.165 --> 01:10:57.218
So I want to
marry this white girl

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.408
that I find beautiful.

01:10:58.410 --> 01:11:00.068
But I want to live in South Carolina.

01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:01.548
How does that happen?

01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:04.448
Maybe I'll study
computer science or something.

01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:06.690
Like study programming, or...

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:11.598
So you're gonna
tell me that the only reason

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.018
that we're getting hung
by trees and shot...

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:15.378
Jews, we got the Holocaust.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:16.978
Black people have got slavery.

01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:18.538
No, no, no. Cut that out.

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:19.908
- What?
- The Holocaust.

01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:21.268
Like you have some designation

01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:23.158
and dominion over all holocausts.

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.888
The Native Americans had a holocaust.

01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:26.568
How do you think we got here?

01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:28.548
Where do you think they
all are man? They're dead.

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:32.183
You are white. Period.

01:11:32.185 --> 01:11:33.958
Not all white people are the same!

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:37.338
Come on, Irish, and Slavic,
and Jewish, and Italian.

01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:38.958
Scandinavian, they're all different man.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.158
Just like not all black
people are the same.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.488
You don't get it! I don't
want to tell you this!

01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:46.778
I don't want to have this conversation!

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:48.458
I don't want to wear the backpack

01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:50.388
of my brothers and my sisters.

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:52.320
For all I care, I'm sick of all of it.

01:11:52.322 --> 01:11:55.495
You know what I am? Every
single day I'm black.

01:11:55.497 --> 01:11:58.378
I'm a nigger on Tuesday,
and a black on Thursday,

01:11:58.380 --> 01:11:59.578
and an African-American on Wednesday,

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:01.928
and a negro in the '70s,
and a colored there.

01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:04.598
And I don't pick any of those names.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.688
Where was the meeting where I said,

01:12:05.690 --> 01:12:07.098
"Yes, I'm African-American.

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:08.908
"You know what, I think I'll be black.

01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:10.782
"I think I'll have the hardest way to go.

01:12:10.784 --> 01:12:12.378
"I think I'll have police brutality.

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:13.768
"I think I'll have some slavery.

01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:15.008
"I think I'll have some oppression.

01:12:15.010 --> 01:12:16.548
"I think I'll choose all of that.

01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:18.818
"Yes, please give me more of that, sir."

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:19.718
Have you ever heard of Trayvon Martin?

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.618
Yeah, I've heard of that guy.

01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:23.408
He's got some Skittles, and an iced tea.

01:12:23.410 --> 01:12:26.498
And some rent-a-cop, that
ain't even really black.

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.548
But you know that's one level
up because you're lighter,

01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:30.278
and you're Mexican, and you're Latino.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.358
So you're one level up from nigger.

01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.948
So you get to kill me. You get to kill me.

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:38.558
Then a jury of your
peers, that look like you,

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.368
say, "You know what.

01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:42.960
"I do think that a man
with a hood is scary.

01:12:44.010 --> 01:12:45.308
"I think a man with a hood..."

01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:47.105
Aren't you scared? Are you scared yet?

01:12:47.107 --> 01:12:48.465
Okay. I get it, I get it.

01:12:48.467 --> 01:12:51.308
- Do you get it?
- I get it! I get it!

01:12:51.310 --> 01:12:52.141
Okay, you want to know the truth?

01:12:52.143 --> 01:12:52.974
You want to know the truth?

01:12:52.976 --> 01:12:54.868
- Educate me.
- I will educate you.

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:58.048
I am so glad to finally educate you.

01:12:58.050 --> 01:12:59.488
I'm telling you that everything

01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:01.258
you're rooted in is a choice.

01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:02.968
Everything you've got is a choice.

01:13:02.970 --> 01:13:03.993
Everything you've got is a choice!

01:13:03.995 --> 01:13:05.328
It's not a fucking choice!

01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:08.498
I'm black, do you see
me?! You can't wash it!

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:11.940
You can't scrub it! You
can't dress it up in a tie!

01:13:13.085 --> 01:13:17.252
My culture, everything that
I am, I can't wash it away.

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.418
It just stays.

01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:21.558
Listen, listen.

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.920
- I'm done! I'm done!
- I'm done too.

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.418
It's not you. It's not you.

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:30.228
You cannot make this
right. You can't fix it.

01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:32.298
And don't get me wrong.
I love white people.

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:36.200
I'm sorry man. I'm sorry.

01:13:43.897 --> 01:13:46.647
Come on player. Come on player.

01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:56.828
It's mostly when I write

01:13:56.830 --> 01:14:00.858
I get my inspiration from
living in New York City.

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:04.700
And I wanted to have
two actors explore that.

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:07.658
I think that's a good inspiration point.

01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:10.868
So what about you guys? How
was the working process?

01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:12.888
I really personally enjoyed the process.

01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:17.218
I thought that the openness of the improv

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:20.548
really allowed us to really
take a script that was written,

01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:22.988
even though inspired by
member, written by a woman,

01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:26.468
to really explore who we
truthfully are as men.

01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:28.788
I really appreciate that, Claire.

01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:31.388
Those were not my words.

01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:32.788
When you say, "Those were not my words,"

01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:34.408
are you referring to kind of like,

01:14:34.410 --> 01:14:36.568
the Plato cave sort of thing,

01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:39.218
like what is a reflection of what?

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:41.058
What do you mean by that?

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:45.155
I just mean that the words
that were spoken here tonight

01:14:45.157 --> 01:14:48.518
were not my words, they were not the words

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:51.818
that were written on the page.

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:54.142
Yeah. We made your words better.

01:14:54.144 --> 01:14:55.778
I think that's really pompous.

01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:58.148
We gave you lots of
great things to work with.

01:14:58.150 --> 01:14:59.128
That's called writing.

01:14:59.130 --> 01:15:01.728
So absolutely we should
get a writing credit,

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:04.268
because you constantly
wanted us to improv.

01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:06.928
No, you definitely should
get a writing credit,

01:15:06.930 --> 01:15:09.882
because this was not my work, so I agree.

01:15:09.884 --> 01:15:10.838
Yeah, well it's not just your work.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.888
It's never just one person!

01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:13.908
I can hear you. I'm right here.

01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:18.058
We improved to understand
to get under the character.

01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:19.378
...is the reason that you're a lesbian.

01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:20.463
What? What?

01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:24.648
Because you just want to
do whatever you want to do,

01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:26.068
and feel whatever you want to do.

01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:29.508
And there's no lines,
and there's no structure.

01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:31.768
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

01:15:31.770 --> 01:15:33.718
And then you asked
us to bring our lives,

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:35.058
which we know about being men,

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:36.658
actually know what it's like to be a man

01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:38.408
and live in a man's body.

01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:39.918
We do, and you don't.

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:41.348
And then you're gonna write something,

01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:43.680
and get in front of people,
and tell us we're wrong?

01:15:55.845 --> 01:15:56.678
Fuck!

01:16:19.589 --> 01:16:24.589
