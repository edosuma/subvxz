BLUE IS STILL
MY FAVORITE COLOR.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.261
AND DON'T GET USED
TO THE SMILE,

20:30.263 --> 20:31.962
'CAUSE YOU'RE STILL NOT FUNNY.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.630
- HUH?

20:35.467 --> 20:37.567
RAVEN!

20:37.569 --> 20:39.769
- QUIT IT.

20:43.941 --> 20:46.841
- ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL,
4 EYES IS HISTORY,

20:46.843 --> 20:48.442
HIS GHOULIES ARE GONE,

20:48.444 --> 20:51.244
AND WE JUST SAVED
THE WHOLE DANG UNIVERSE.

20:51.246 --> 20:52.979
WHO WANTS FRENCH TOAST?

20:52.981 --> 20:54.613
- ME--
- OH, YES, ME, PLEASE!

20:54.615 --> 20:58.350
I SHALL CONSUME THEM WITH GRAVY
AND THE BUTTER OF PEANUTS.

20:58.352 --> 21:02.419
- AND I'VE GOT ENOUGH TOFU BACON
FOR EVERYBODY WHO WANTS IT.

21:02.421 --> 21:05.388
- SO...JUST ENOUGH FOR YOU?

21:05.390 --> 21:07.189
- EXACTLY.

21:07.191 --> 21:11.626
- OBSERVE.
I AM A RORTHIAN ZOTHGAR.

21:11.628 --> 21:13.727
HEE HEE!

21:15.430 --> 21:19.264
ON MY PLANET,
THIS IS HILARIOUS.

21:19.266 --> 21:21.232
- HA HA HA!
- HA HA HA!

21:27.272 --> 21:28.671
- SLADE GOT AWAY?

21:28.673 --> 21:32.807
- IF HE EVER SHOWS HIS FACE
AGAIN, WE'LL BE READY.

21:32.809 --> 21:34.241
- HOW DO YOU DO IT, ROBIN?

21:34.243 --> 21:36.610
- DO WHAT?
- KEEP HOPING?

21:36.612 --> 21:40.480
AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED,
EVERYTHING I DID,

21:40.482 --> 21:43.683
HOW DID YOU STILL MANAGE TO HOPE
IT COULD ALL WORK OUT?

21:43.685 --> 21:45.217
- BECAUSE OF YOU.

21:45.219 --> 21:46.918
YOU DON'T REALIZE IT,
RAVEN,

21:46.920 --> 21:49.854
BUT YOU'RE ACTUALLY
THE MOST HOPEFUL PERSON
I'VE EVER MET.

21:49.856 --> 21:52.656
FROM THE DAY YOU WERE BORN,
THEY SAID YOU WERE EVIL,

21:52.658 --> 21:55.892
THAT YOU WERE CREATED TO DO
UNSPEAKABLE THINGS.

21:55.894 --> 21:57.493
BUT YOU WISHED FOR MORE.

21:57.495 --> 22:00.863
YOU DARED TO HOPE
THAT YOU COULD BE A HERO.

22:00.865 --> 22:02.831
- I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL OVER.

22:02.833 --> 22:04.766
AND NOW, SUDDENLY...

22:04.768 --> 22:07.502
- YOU HAVE YOUR WHOLE LIFE
AHEAD OF YOU.

22:07.504 --> 22:10.171
YOU CAN DECIDE
YOUR OWN DESTINY.

22:10.173 --> 22:14.308
- I GUESS IN THE END,
THERE REALLY IS NO END.

22:14.310 --> 22:17.877
JUST NEW BEGINNINGS.

22:17.879 --> 22:19.111
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?

22:19.113 --> 22:21.713
ARE WE HAVING A PARTY
IN HERE OR NOT?

22:21.715 --> 22:23.448
- GLORIOUS!

22:23.450 --> 22:24.549
- PARTY!

22:24.551 --> 22:25.650
- HAVING A PARTY?
I'M HAVING A PARTY!

22:25.652 --> 22:29.320
[LAUGHTER, CHATTER]

22:46.471 --> 22:49.538
- ¶ T-E-E-N, T-I-T-A-N-S ¶

22:49.540 --> 22:52.474
