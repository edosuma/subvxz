00:09.206 --> 00:11.897
Hey, pretty boy.

00:11.897 --> 00:14.202
How'd you like to go to Texas?

00:14.202 --> 00:16.472
I'd love to.
I haven't had my shots.

00:16.472 --> 00:18.700
I used to work on the Texas
innocence project.

00:18.700 --> 00:22.632
One of my cases is up on appeal
and they've asked me back to argue.

00:22.632 --> 00:24.878
I could really use your help.

00:24.878 --> 00:27.289
–Because?
–My last appearance…

00:27.289 --> 00:30.533
I unfortunately lost my temper
with the chief judge.

00:30.533 --> 00:33.011
I'm afraid he could be
prejudiced against me.

00:33.011 --> 00:34.916
So I'm looking for the best
lawyer I can find.

00:34.916 --> 00:37.590
I think that's you.

00:38.219 --> 00:41.401
–What kind of case is this?
–Capital.

00:41.740 --> 00:45.940
The client is scheduled
to be executed in 72 hours.

00:46.364 --> 00:48.650
He could be innocent.

00:48.650 --> 00:50.919
What do you say?

00:50.919 --> 00:53.646
I say I've always wanted 
to go to Texas.

00:55.599 --> 00:59.648

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON ABC: 2005/03/20

01:26.215 --> 01:28.599
I certainly appreciate
you seeing me, Shirley.

01:28.599 --> 01:30.947
I know how busy you are.

01:31.065 --> 01:34.029
Miriam, how long have 
we known each other?

01:34.029 --> 01:36.806
Well, certainly very long.

01:36.806 --> 01:43.575
But I am mindful of your hectic
schedule, and I'm appreciative.

01:44.358 --> 01:46.584
What's up?

01:46.584 --> 01:50.394
Well, I don't know
exactly how to say this,

01:50.394 --> 01:55.241
especially to someone with whom
I've enjoyed a long and rewarding friendship.

01:55.241 --> 01:59.798
But I've gotten myself
into a situation.

01:59.798 --> 02:06.861
I'm beginning a trial next week
in which I'm…

02:08.743 --> 02:11.205
the defendant.

02:13.757 --> 02:16.336
It's a criminal case?

02:16.336 --> 02:21.634
I'm charged with engaging
in sexual conduct for a fee.

02:23.624 --> 02:26.418
You paid a man 
to have sex with you?

02:26.418 --> 02:29.527
Many times.

02:29.689 --> 02:33.507
When you say “many times”…

02:33.507 --> 02:36.796
Hundreds.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.490
You are not going to wear that
once we get there.

03:05.490 --> 03:09.174
–Why not?
–This court antagonizes easily.

03:09.174 --> 03:11.905
Understood. How do I look?

03:13.261 --> 03:15.987
The client's name is Ezekiel Borns.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.463
He likes to be called Zeke,
he has an I.Q of 80.

03:19.463 --> 03:24.524
He was convicted eight years ago in the 
shooting death of a gas station attendant.

03:24.524 --> 03:27.046
We finally got a DNA test ordered.
It came back negative.

03:27.046 --> 03:30.504
One would think that would be
enough to clear him.

03:30.504 --> 03:34.088
But the problem is he confessed
after an all-night interrogation.

03:34.088 --> 03:37.300
He could have been coerced,
maybe brainwashed, maybe both.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.874
When we land, I would
like you to go meet Zeke

03:39.874 --> 03:41.396
while I try to get a meeting
with the D.A.

03:41.396 --> 03:42.793
I assume you already
tried the governor.

03:42.793 --> 03:44.601
I'm told he giggled.

03:44.601 --> 03:46.383
High court is our last stop.

03:46.383 --> 03:49.106
–High court?
–Texas doesn't have a supreme court.

03:49.106 --> 03:51.465
They have two High courts,
one for civil, and one for criminal.

03:51.465 --> 03:54.326
And the chief judge
on the criminal High court…

03:54.326 --> 03:56.777
we had words on another case.

03:56.777 --> 03:59.847
When you say you had words…

04:00.101 --> 04:03.491
I called him a disgusting fat pig.

04:08.524 --> 04:12.138
Denny Crane?
Oh, no, I, I couldn't possibly…

04:12.138 --> 04:15.888
Miriam, listen, your case
comes before judge Clark Brown.

04:15.888 --> 04:17.724
Denny seems 
to have a take on him.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.363
I couldn't possibly.

04:19.363 --> 04:21.512
Shirley…

04:23.190 --> 04:25.725
I don't tell people this,

04:25.725 --> 04:28.028
but Denny and I…

04:28.028 --> 04:31.758
I once had relations with him.

04:32.539 --> 04:35.996
Listen, this many offenses…

04:35.996 --> 04:38.515
you could be looking at time here.

04:38.515 --> 04:42.699
If Denny gives us any 
advantage at all…

04:43.087 --> 04:45.867
I'm so beyond humiliated.

04:45.867 --> 04:49.592
Which brings me to my next bomb.

04:49.592 --> 04:55.667
I see no real defense here,
except, perhaps, medical.

04:55.667 --> 05:00.028
I'd like to be able 
to tell the jury that…

05:00.028 --> 05:03.752
you're a nymphomaniac.

05:14.702 --> 05:16.603
Has he ever shared with you 
any information

05:16.603 --> 05:19.301
that could possibly contradict
his signed confession?

05:19.301 --> 05:22.531
Uh, no, but I'd never inquire.

05:22.531 --> 05:25.231
Not a curious guy, Father.

05:25.349 --> 05:29.762
The role of clergy is only to get
the inmates ready and willing to die.

05:37.064 --> 05:39.064
Zeke?

05:39.855 --> 05:42.699
My name is Alan Shore.

05:42.965 --> 05:45.393
I was all doped up.

05:45.393 --> 05:48.792
I remember being 
at the gas station, but…

05:48.792 --> 05:51.413
Well, Zeke, why did you confess?

05:51.413 --> 05:54.531
They kept telling me I did it.

05:54.531 --> 05:57.715
And they had witnesses.
I knew I had been there.

05:57.715 --> 05:59.022
I probably did do it.

05:59.022 --> 06:02.505
Your confessions didn't include
the word “probably.”

06:03.501 --> 06:08.282
Zeke, you have no memory
of shooting the attendant.

06:08.649 --> 06:12.202
You're gonna get me sent to hell
is what you're doing.

06:12.202 --> 06:15.833
–I beg your pardon?
–I've already made my peace with God.

06:15.833 --> 06:19.392
If I start saying I didn't do it…

06:19.517 --> 06:23.562
Zeke, I'm trying to prevent
your being executed.

06:23.562 --> 06:26.425
They're gonna kill me, Mr Shore.

06:26.425 --> 06:30.277
And my only salvation's
in the next world.

06:30.277 --> 06:33.678
I gotta keep my peace with God.

06:42.722 --> 06:44.819
Is this from his trial lawyer?

06:44.819 --> 06:46.780
Went into a 12-step program.

06:46.780 --> 06:50.042
Had to apologize 
to those he let down.

06:50.042 --> 06:53.057
–Has Zeke seen this?
–We sent him a copy.

06:53.057 --> 06:55.875
Zeke doesn't write back.

06:56.089 --> 06:57.835
Right.

07:02.945 --> 07:05.365
–Nymphomania?
–Anything you can find.

07:05.365 --> 07:09.546
And we'll need to line up an expert who 
can testify possibly as soon as tomorrow.

07:09.546 --> 07:11.195
It's not a real disease.

07:11.195 --> 07:13.503
It's an excuse offered up
by sex-perv sickos.

07:13.503 --> 07:17.434
Yes, Brad, thank you for that. –It's also 
a sexist diagnosis, as well as bogus.

07:17.434 --> 07:20.026
If a man was running around
trying to shtup everything he could,

07:20.026 --> 07:22.179
we wouldn't say that he had a disease,
we would just call him…

07:22.179 --> 07:23.769
Denny Crane.

07:23.769 --> 07:26.546
Exactly.
I'll need that research ASAP.

07:26.546 --> 07:28.666
Denny, right this way.
Thank you for joining.

07:28.666 --> 07:30.974
I'm a very busy man.
I have a caseload.

07:30.974 --> 07:32.628
You wouldn't believe. So…

07:32.628 --> 07:34.938
Hello, Denny.

07:35.654 --> 07:37.910
Miriam?

07:38.734 --> 07:40.977
Don't tell me I have another child.

07:40.977 --> 07:44.401
Miriam has a criminal case
beginning tomorrow.

07:44.401 --> 07:47.188
Criminal?

07:47.305 --> 07:49.036
What did you do?

07:49.036 --> 07:51.289
I can tell you what 
she's charged with.

07:51.289 --> 07:53.322
Can I count on your sensitivity?

07:53.322 --> 07:55.635
Of course.

07:55.635 --> 08:00.331
She's charged with engaging
in sexual conduct for a fee.

08:02.885 --> 08:04.786
You're a hooker?

08:04.786 --> 08:06.688
–I'm leaving.
–No.

08:06.839 --> 08:09.202
She paid for sex.
She didn't charge for it.

08:09.202 --> 08:11.923
And the judge is Clark Brown,
which is the reason you're here,

08:11.923 --> 08:14.701
in addition to your 
profound tenderness.

08:14.701 --> 08:19.129
We plan to perhaps use
a medical defense of…

08:19.129 --> 08:21.801
nymphomania.

08:22.076 --> 08:24.653
–You're a nymph?
–Denny.

08:24.653 --> 08:30.515
You mean when you and I went on 
that long weekend to Napa, and, and

08:30.515 --> 08:35.147
you did those things…

08:36.183 --> 08:38.894
She was sick.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.637
We have work to do.
We can't…

08:55.637 --> 08:58.977
I'm not about to go to Texas and
not ride the mechanical bull, Chelina.

08:58.977 --> 09:02.337
That would be like going to Los Angeles
and not sleeping with Paris Hilton.

09:02.337 --> 09:04.006
–You'll get hurt.
–Nonsense.

09:04.006 --> 09:06.957
I grew up riding ponies
in the pumpkin patch.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.465
Chelina.

09:11.465 --> 09:14.438
Yes. We've just had a slight delay.

09:14.438 --> 09:17.422
Alan wants to ride a bull.

09:18.531 --> 09:20.569
Can you get me the case?

09:20.569 --> 09:22.748
Fax it to the motel.

09:22.748 --> 09:24.757
Thank you.

09:26.156 --> 09:29.289
Evidently, an execution
got stayed in Connecticut.

09:29.289 --> 09:32.200
The lawyers argued something
called “death row syndrome.”

09:32.200 --> 09:33.675
Death row syndrome?

09:33.675 --> 09:36.969
The theory being that death row can
actually overwhelm the will to live,

09:36.969 --> 09:39.978
and contribute to 
a general incompetence.

09:39.978 --> 09:42.427
–That could be Zeke.
–Exactly.

09:42.427 --> 09:44.408
Notify my next of kin.

09:44.946 --> 09:46.404
Oh, God.

09:46.404 --> 09:49.243
Novice, intermediate, or expert?

09:49.243 --> 09:50.628
Expert.

09:50.628 --> 09:52.444
I teach it, actually.

09:56.108 --> 09:58.384
Do I get a whip?

10:01.448 --> 10:03.127
Intermediate.

10:04.151 --> 10:06.344
Intermediate.

10:06.344 --> 10:08.471
Chelina.

10:08.471 --> 10:09.930
We will.

10:09.930 --> 10:13.913
10:00 A.M. is, it's fine.
We'll be in his office.

10:14.026 --> 10:15.863
Thanks, Jerry.

10:15.863 --> 10:18.670
–We got our meeting with the D.A.
–Great.

10:18.980 --> 10:21.346
Intermediate.

10:21.465 --> 10:23.064
Help.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.642
Help!

10:24.642 --> 10:26.438
Intermediate!

10:31.528 --> 10:33.335
It's not a real disease.

10:33.335 --> 10:37.167
It is part of our culture, Brad, and 
our role here is as advocates, remember?

10:37.167 --> 10:39.057
Shirley, that point is well taken.

10:39.057 --> 10:42.076
There is an enormous risk
with this kind of defense.

10:42.076 --> 10:44.948
–If the jury rejects it…
–But juries often don't.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.936
In 1970, we had the cable car
nymphomaniac in San Francisco.

10:47.936 --> 10:51.478
She was awarded $50,000 for a crash
that left her with a demonic sex urge.

10:51.478 --> 10:56.057
That case occurred when the medical
community was more open to the diagnosis.

10:56.057 --> 10:57.876
Well, there are other possible
diagnoses as well.

10:57.876 --> 10:59.254
She could be bipolar.

10:59.254 --> 11:01.676
There's also a condition
known as Kluver-Bucy syndrome,

11:01.676 --> 11:03.692
which can result in hypersexuality.

11:03.692 --> 11:07.616
Miriam Watson is a very successful
and private businesswoman.

11:07.616 --> 11:10.468
Should we raise 
nymphomania as a defense,

11:10.468 --> 11:12.203
the media will have a field day.

11:12.203 --> 11:14.346
Which is why we're trying
to nip this with a plea bargain.

11:14.346 --> 11:16.380
But without some defense,
we have no leverage.

11:16.380 --> 11:19.574
Judge Brown.

11:19.838 --> 11:21.834
Come again?

11:21.834 --> 11:25.854
I don't like it when you say that, Shirley.
It puts pressure on me.

11:28.123 --> 11:30.733
What about judge Brown?

11:30.733 --> 11:33.177
He's a virgin.

11:35.038 --> 11:38.242
And that would be relevant how?

11:38.242 --> 11:44.810
If he saw in our client an opportunity…

11:48.985 --> 11:51.359
May I speak to you two a second?

11:52.065 --> 11:53.611
This is not funny.

11:53.611 --> 11:55.425
That man is a senior partner here,

11:55.425 --> 11:57.969
and the only time of the day
he's not making lewd sexual inferences

11:57.969 --> 11:59.750
is when he's doing so blatantly.
–Lori…

11:59.750 --> 12:01.160
No, Shirley, I am sick of it.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.695
I am making an official complaint.

12:03.695 --> 12:06.360
You're on notice.
And you're on notice.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.486
I've had enough.

12:21.836 --> 12:26.140
First, you cannot, cannot argue
the morality of the death penalty.

12:26.140 --> 12:29.034
–Every judge sitting up there is for it.
–Clearly.

12:29.034 --> 12:31.510
Second, do not mention 
Zeke's innocence.

12:31.510 --> 12:32.608
I'm sorry?

12:32.608 --> 12:35.382
They won't listen.
He did confess.

12:35.382 --> 12:38.852
Isn't it the DNA test
that got us the appeal?

12:38.852 --> 12:41.007
The DNA here does 
not exonerate him.

12:41.007 --> 12:44.946
It certainly indicates the presence
of somebody else at the murder scene.

12:44.946 --> 12:46.989
Proving innocence is one thing.

12:46.989 --> 12:49.935
But since we can't do that,
our case here is procedural.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.252
The DNA result is 
ancillary evidence,

12:52.252 --> 12:56.380
which hopefully will occasion 
them to look at procedural flaws.

12:56.380 --> 12:57.958
Does that make any sense?

12:57.958 --> 13:00.121
Yes, it does.

13:00.121 --> 13:02.265
This is Texas.

13:02.311 --> 13:04.537
I must say, I agree 
with the district attorney.

13:04.537 --> 13:06.907
If this were a one-time offense,

13:06.907 --> 13:09.876
but the complaint alleges
over 100 infractions.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.962
–It's shocking.
–If I may, your honor.

13:12.962 --> 13:15.737
–This is a victimless crime.
–Victimless?

13:15.737 --> 13:18.563
When somebody's action
impugns the values of society,

13:18.563 --> 13:22.575
we are all victims.
–Yes, yes, yes for all that.

13:22.575 --> 13:26.662
But consider the shy people.

13:26.662 --> 13:28.518
–The shy people?
–Yes.

13:28.518 --> 13:32.622
If one were a single man,
painfully shy,

13:32.622 --> 13:40.299
a virgin, time running out,
one might like to meet this woman.

13:40.714 --> 13:44.934
She could help one.

13:49.171 --> 13:51.531
He's mentally impaired, Glenn.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.953
You know this.
Your own expert said so.

13:53.953 --> 13:56.694
He was born with severe
fetal alcohol syndrome.

13:56.694 --> 13:59.257
Chelina, this was all raised at trial.

13:59.257 --> 14:01.214
Now, at some point, 
a finding has to be final.

14:01.214 --> 14:04.060
I'm sorry. I realize I'm new,

14:04.060 --> 14:08.626
but didn't the supreme court rule
you can't execute mentally retarded people?

14:08.626 --> 14:10.245
He has an I.Q of 80.

14:10.245 --> 14:13.127
The cutoff point for retardation
in Texas is 70.

14:13.127 --> 14:16.756
Did you even read the prison reports
on Zeke's character?

14:16.756 --> 14:19.700
This isn't about whether
he's been a good boy in prison.

14:19.700 --> 14:22.120
Point is what 
he did at the gas station.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.792
Perhaps he didn't do it.

14:23.792 --> 14:25.845
He has an I.Q of 80.

14:25.845 --> 14:30.250
All you really have is a confession,
which most likely was a product of coercion.

14:30.250 --> 14:33.269
No weapon was found.
DNA placed someone else at the scene.

14:33.269 --> 14:36.733
How about on the possibility
of Zeke Borns' innocence,

14:36.733 --> 14:39.611
we hold off just a bit on killing him?

14:40.933 --> 14:43.685
You must be new 
to Texas, Mr Shore.

14:44.144 --> 14:46.972
–I told you not to raise innocence.
–How could we not raise it?

14:46.972 --> 14:49.182
They hear it all the time,
Alan, don't you get it?

14:49.182 --> 14:51.507
“My client is innocent.
My client is innocent,”

14:51.507 --> 14:54.777
every single complaint case.
It's the standard refrain.

14:54.777 --> 14:58.143
It has no impact when you can't
actually prove it, which we can't.

14:58.143 --> 15:00.879
–The trier of fact found him guilty.
–That doesn't mean we can't argue…

15:00.879 --> 15:03.227
Look, I've done this before.

15:03.227 --> 15:05.303
I know the way it works down here.

15:05.303 --> 15:09.532
Our claim has to be procedural.
It's the only chance Zeke has.

15:09.532 --> 15:11.863
And before you march into court

15:11.863 --> 15:14.062
and tell everybody
that the confession was coerced,

15:14.062 --> 15:17.275
keep in mind Zeke hasn't recanted.

15:17.275 --> 15:20.901
He's still maintaining he did it.

15:32.596 --> 15:35.435
Lori, while we understand
your issues with Denny,

15:35.435 --> 15:38.694
while we are certainly taking
steps to resolve them,

15:38.694 --> 15:42.105
I don't think you need to lodge an official
complaint of sexual harassment.

15:42.105 --> 15:44.274
–Shirley…
–Because if you do,

15:44.274 --> 15:47.106
we are required by law
to initiate certain procedures.

15:47.106 --> 15:49.116
It could get very 
messy for all involved.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.374
Is that a threat?

15:51.442 --> 15:55.753
He is ultimately a benign man
who we all happen to care about,

15:55.753 --> 15:57.421
including you.

15:57.421 --> 16:04.312
I think what you really mean to do
is to voice your concern unofficially.

16:04.312 --> 16:06.505
I am making an official complaint.

16:06.505 --> 16:11.245
If there's paperwork to be filled out,
please have the forms sent to my office.

16:13.425 --> 16:16.724
You little bitch.

16:22.635 --> 16:26.428
There is no evidence of you
ever having had a gun before,

16:26.428 --> 16:29.143
or ever shooting one.

16:29.143 --> 16:30.502
Zeke…

16:30.502 --> 16:32.484
I certainly don't wanna 
put words in your mouth,

16:32.484 --> 16:36.679
but if you have 
no memory of doing it…

16:37.618 --> 16:39.836
If you don't recant,

16:39.836 --> 16:44.032
by this time tomorrow,
you will be dead.

16:44.032 --> 16:47.114
I'm gonna be dead no matter what.

16:47.114 --> 16:52.540
The question is, do I go with God
on my side or not?

16:53.219 --> 16:57.228
From what little I know of God, Zeke,
he's on your side no matter what.

16:57.228 --> 17:00.069
He also favors the side of truth.

17:00.069 --> 17:01.689
Now, if the truth is you didn't do it…

17:01.689 --> 17:03.972
I did drugs.

17:04.236 --> 17:05.861
I stole.

17:05.861 --> 17:08.878
I was a bad person.

17:10.227 --> 17:13.688
And now I need to be a strong person.

17:13.688 --> 17:17.281
I need to have courage now for once.

17:17.700 --> 17:20.413
I'm gonna be brave.

17:24.494 --> 17:30.614
After my marriage dissolved,
my sexual desire became inflamed.

17:30.614 --> 17:33.012
I was in a few relationships,

17:33.012 --> 17:37.327
and my appetite took on
more the form of an addiction.

17:37.327 --> 17:39.279
When you say “addiction”…

17:39.279 --> 17:43.796
Now whenever I so much as look
at an able-bodied man,

17:43.796 --> 17:50.068
my southern region turns tropical.

17:54.521 --> 18:00.264
And this compulsion
led you to male prostitutes?

18:00.264 --> 18:02.386
Where else was I to go?

18:02.386 --> 18:04.610
I'm a 56-year-old woman.

18:04.610 --> 18:08.621
It's not as if I can
walk into a bar, or…

18:08.621 --> 18:11.500
I suppose if I were 
in a relationship…

18:28.977 --> 18:31.462
What the hell was that?

18:31.462 --> 18:38.069
“My southern region turns tropical,”
that little look to the judge?

18:39.121 --> 18:41.800
Did you coach her to do that?

18:41.800 --> 18:44.216
If the judge likes us,
he gives us a good instruction.

18:44.216 --> 18:46.961
It's as simple as that.
He might even give us a directed verdict.

18:46.961 --> 18:50.686
I'm sensing some intent issues
with the prosecution's case.

18:50.686 --> 18:52.698
I can feel it.

18:52.698 --> 18:57.647
The judge has intent issues.

19:07.926 --> 19:10.082
These judges are 
only human, Chelina.

19:10.082 --> 19:15.037
They certainly have to appreciate
the possibility of his innocence here.

19:16.435 --> 19:21.249
When I left this job, I told everybody
it was because I wanted to make more money.

19:21.249 --> 19:24.461
The truth is I couldn't take it anymore.

19:24.461 --> 19:27.786
I couldn't take seeing clients die.

19:27.786 --> 19:30.318
Did you win any?

19:30.318 --> 19:32.301
Sometimes you 
must have prevailed.

19:32.301 --> 19:35.417
I remember reading a death penalty
was overturned here just last year.

19:35.417 --> 19:38.839
Yeah, a New York firm
volunteered to handle it.

19:38.839 --> 19:41.964
It took them 10 years
and cost $5 million.

19:41.964 --> 19:46.698
The state of Texas has the most overwhelmed
and underfunded defense bar in the country.

19:46.698 --> 19:49.329
They get $25,000 to 
appeal a death case.

19:49.329 --> 19:51.532
The prosecutors have 
an unlimited budget.

19:51.532 --> 19:54.026
–It's a joke, Alan.
–We have good grounds here,

19:54.026 --> 19:57.157
the trial lawyer has admitted
he provided inadequate counsel.

19:57.157 --> 20:01.371
Alan, this is the court that held a sleeping
lawyer isn't necessarily inadequate.

20:01.371 --> 20:04.971
You have to show he was sleeping
during the important parts.

20:07.368 --> 20:10.693
You asked me before why Texas,

20:10.693 --> 20:14.140
instead of having a supreme court,
it has two High courts?

20:14.140 --> 20:16.420
The reason…

20:16.420 --> 20:19.321
is to speed up the death cases.

20:19.321 --> 20:22.240
They've cut the time it takes
to execute people in half.

20:22.240 --> 20:26.700
It's why Texas leads the country
in executions proudly.

20:26.700 --> 20:32.390
Seven of the nine judges you will 
face tomorrow are former prosecutors.

20:36.330 --> 20:38.198
Hey.

20:42.997 --> 20:45.472
Hey.

20:49.045 --> 20:51.430
I promise you…

20:51.430 --> 20:53.595
by the time I finish tomorrow,

20:53.595 --> 20:58.548
those judges, every last one of them
will rise up and say,

20:58.548 --> 21:03.302
“Never mind executing Ezekiel Borns,
let's kill Alan Shore instead.”

21:20.233 --> 21:23.058
I'm sorry.

21:27.101 --> 21:29.146
Maybe we…

21:29.146 --> 21:32.705
we should probably 
get back to work.

21:37.345 --> 21:39.928
Yeah.

21:52.435 --> 21:56.418
Public presence here, Jerry.
There's one protestor outside.

21:56.418 --> 21:59.523
<i>What am I gonna do, Chelina?
It's just not as big a story as it used to be.</i>

21:59.523 --> 22:02.891
We'd be better off 
with nobody than one.

22:03.492 --> 22:06.003
I'll call you after.

22:39.266 --> 22:42.295
I told you you are not 
wearing that hat.

22:42.295 --> 22:44.834
Take it off.

22:50.716 --> 22:53.901
Listen, last night…

22:53.901 --> 22:59.665
sometimes lawyers will bond
over a cause, and, well, I…

23:00.013 --> 23:03.094
Chelina,

23:03.094 --> 23:05.785
let's go argue the cause.

23:09.742 --> 23:12.306
Remember, this motion
is a nuisance to them.

23:12.306 --> 23:14.227
They will antagonize you.

23:14.227 --> 23:17.653
If you even feel yourself
wanting to retaliate, you say,

23:17.653 --> 23:22.441
“with all due respect,
may it please the court.”

23:22.441 --> 23:25.231
Anything else?

23:25.630 --> 23:27.227
Persevere.

23:27.227 --> 23:31.396
They will try to shut you down
before you even begin.

23:32.024 --> 23:34.277
Persevere.

23:34.277 --> 23:36.220
I got it.

23:36.955 --> 23:38.747
There is no question that

23:38.747 --> 23:45.343
the defendant entered into a transaction
for sex with someone for consideration.

23:45.343 --> 23:46.593
However,

23:46.593 --> 23:50.800
one element of this crime
is criminal intent.

23:50.800 --> 23:54.848
The burden is on the prosecution to prove
this element beyond all reasonable doubt.

23:54.848 --> 23:58.144
If a medical condition deprived
the defendant of her free will,

23:58.144 --> 24:03.104
or even unduly influenced her,
she lacked that intent.

24:03.104 --> 24:05.532
Since the prosecution failed to eliminate

24:05.532 --> 24:09.285
hypersexuality or bipolar syndrome

24:09.285 --> 24:13.614
or Kluver-Bucy syndrome
as a cause for her conduct,

24:13.614 --> 24:19.329
well, then, I feel I have no choice
but to deliver a verdict in favor of…

24:19.329 --> 24:21.910
the defendant.

24:21.910 --> 24:25.552
Miss Watson, 
you are free to go.

24:34.263 --> 24:35.581
What?

24:35.581 --> 24:36.999
You got to that judge.

24:36.999 --> 24:39.479
–I don't know what you're talking about.
–You knew his ruling by heart.

24:39.479 --> 24:42.762
Boilerplate. –A ruling that 
was ridiculously pro-defense.

24:42.762 --> 24:43.994
Denny Crane.

24:43.994 --> 24:46.589
What did you do, promise 
him a date with our client?

24:46.589 --> 24:49.401
First of all, I would never ever
do anything like that, never.

24:49.401 --> 24:51.727
Secondly, if I did, I would 
never ever tell you. Never.

24:51.727 --> 24:53.434
Third…

24:53.434 --> 24:56.931
And you, was there 
any quid pro quo here?

24:56.931 --> 24:59.446
–How dare you?
–Oh, never mind how dare me.

24:59.446 --> 25:04.482
You're a serial intercourser.
That ruling was suspect.

25:04.628 --> 25:08.344
–Bribing a judge.
–Never did that.

25:08.604 --> 25:12.164
Well, the two of you are going to have
to live with yourselves on this one.

25:12.164 --> 25:17.970
For now, like the judge says,
you're free to go, as is your lip.

25:21.896 --> 25:26.346
Ezekiel Borns murdered a man 
in cold blood for a few dollars.

25:26.346 --> 25:28.211
He confessed to it.

25:28.211 --> 25:31.970
The petitioner has gone up and down
state and federal courts,

25:31.970 --> 25:34.168
exhausting his appeals,

25:34.168 --> 25:36.162
losing his habeas arguments,

25:36.162 --> 25:40.847
and failing on claims
of constitutional violations.

25:40.847 --> 25:44.865
Four different courts of appeal 
have reviewed

25:44.865 --> 25:50.277
and rejected each and every one
of his arguments.

25:50.277 --> 25:53.711
Now is the time for this man
to pay the penalty

25:53.711 --> 25:56.423
imposed on him fairly and legally.

25:56.423 --> 26:02.564
Now, a Texas jury has decided
that Ezekiel Borns is a dangerous killer.

26:02.564 --> 26:06.765
He has forfeited his right to live.

26:07.937 --> 26:10.563
Thank you.

26:12.880 --> 26:16.717
“With all due respect,
may it please the court.”

26:23.150 --> 26:24.831
Good afternoon, 
my name is Alan Shore.

26:24.831 --> 26:28.641
Mr Shore, what are the new
issues being raised here?

26:28.641 --> 26:30.373
The first issue before the court

26:30.373 --> 26:33.072
concerns the absence of 
any African American jurors.

26:33.072 --> 26:36.037
That was previously argued
and ruled on, counsel.

26:36.037 --> 26:38.138
Yes, before the lower courts.
This bench has never considered…

26:38.138 --> 26:41.251
We're not persuaded that
the absence of a black juror

26:41.251 --> 26:43.611
is in violation of due process.

26:43.611 --> 26:45.686
What's your next issue?

26:45.686 --> 26:48.318
I would turn the court's attention
to the fact that the grand jury

26:48.318 --> 26:51.606
which indicted Mr Borns
similarily was all white.

26:51.606 --> 26:53.510
This raises equal protection laws…

26:53.510 --> 26:57.511
That issue was never raised,
and is therefore waived.

26:59.255 --> 27:04.908
Your honor, Texas law requires
that the jury recommend death only in cases

27:04.908 --> 27:09.672
where they find that the defendant poses
a threat of future dangerousness to society.

27:09.672 --> 27:11.694
We maintain this is unconstitutional.

27:11.694 --> 27:14.139
Juries are supposed to find
elements of guilt and innocence

27:14.139 --> 27:18.891
based on facts beyond a reasonable doubt,
not on the basis of perceived probabilities.

27:18.891 --> 27:20.703
Moreover, as a practical matter,

27:20.703 --> 27:23.837
since Ezekiel Borns will 
remain in prison for life,

27:23.837 --> 27:26.735
he couldn't possibly constitute
a future threat to society

27:26.735 --> 27:29.187
unless the law assumes prison breaks.

27:29.187 --> 27:32.066
Well, that's an interesting issue, counsel,

27:32.066 --> 27:36.114
but that also was never raised,
and therefore, it is deemed waived.

27:36.114 --> 27:38.330
Next.

27:39.073 --> 27:40.908
May it please the court,

27:40.908 --> 27:44.936
Mr Borns' trial lawyer has recently
admitted he was ineffective counsel.

27:44.936 --> 27:47.947
He was abusing cocaine
and alcohol during the trial…

27:47.947 --> 27:51.357
–Not legally inadequate.
–I believe if you examine the transcripts…

27:51.357 --> 27:55.090
Mr Shore, representation
can always be better,

27:55.090 --> 27:58.664
especially when we play
Monday morning quarterback.

27:58.664 --> 28:00.057
With all due respect,

28:00.057 --> 28:02.510
this lawyer never gave 
an opening statement.

28:02.510 --> 28:05.278
He never questioned several
of the prosecution's witnesses.

28:05.278 --> 28:08.931
He failed to pursue a number of leads
and important sentencing issues.

28:08.931 --> 28:10.899
This court right here today

28:10.899 --> 28:14.262
has recognized that many valid 
grounds for appeal were never raised.

28:14.262 --> 28:17.686
This court is satisfied that
the representation was adequate.

28:17.686 --> 28:20.135
Is there anything else?

28:22.815 --> 28:26.748
Yes, Mr Borns may be innocent.

28:26.953 --> 28:28.681
The jury disagreed,

28:28.681 --> 28:30.834
and legally, 
that issue has been settled.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.099
The DNA evidence shows
somebody else was there.

28:33.099 --> 28:36.946
But it does not disprove
that your client was also there.

28:36.946 --> 28:39.946
And your guy confessed, by the way.

28:39.946 --> 28:44.187
My client has an I.Q of 80.
He was interrogated for 16 hours.

28:44.187 --> 28:45.793
Coercion was never raised.

28:45.793 --> 28:48.713
It was never raised because his
lawyer was an inadequate hack,

28:48.713 --> 28:53.460
though the nine of you seem
quite satisfied with his performance,

28:53.460 --> 28:55.263
with all due respect.

28:55.263 --> 28:58.743
Mr Shore, you came down here
from Massachusetts?

28:58.743 --> 29:00.670
Yes, sir.

29:00.670 --> 29:04.809
We in Texas have been living
with this case for eight years.

29:04.809 --> 29:07.093
You've been living with it personally?

29:07.222 --> 29:10.275
May it please the court.

29:10.275 --> 29:13.226
You first met Mr Borns when?

29:13.226 --> 29:14.637
Yesterday.

29:14.637 --> 29:18.058
And you are proposing to us
that you know him?

29:18.058 --> 29:19.568
You know what I'd like to propose?

29:19.568 --> 29:24.352
I'd like to propose that you got a problem
with the death penalty in general.

29:24.352 --> 29:27.474
Now, is that why you came here, sir?

29:28.726 --> 29:32.478
I am here, with all due respect,
may it please the court,

29:32.478 --> 29:36.099
because I have a problem with a state 
executing a man with diminished capacity

29:36.099 --> 29:37.749
who may very well be innocent.

29:37.749 --> 29:39.840
I'm particularly troubled,
may it please the court,

29:39.840 --> 29:42.715
with all due respect,
that you don't have a problem with it.

29:42.715 --> 29:45.586
You may not want to regard
my client's innocence,

29:45.586 --> 29:47.854
but you cannot 
possibly disregard the fact

29:47.854 --> 29:53.059
that 117 wrongfully convicted people

29:53.059 --> 29:56.251
have been saved from execution
in this country, 117.

29:56.251 --> 29:58.553
The system is hardly foolproof.

29:58.553 --> 30:06.811
And Texas, this state, is responsible
for a full third of all executions in America.

30:06.811 --> 30:08.252
How can that be?

30:08.252 --> 30:10.465
The criminals are just 
somehow worse here?

30:10.465 --> 30:15.139
Last year, you accounted for fully half
of the nation's executions,

30:15.139 --> 30:17.694
50% from one state.

30:17.694 --> 30:23.081
You cannot disregard the possibility, 
the possibility that something's up in Texas.

30:23.081 --> 30:26.351
I would urge you to confine 
your remarks to your client,

30:26.351 --> 30:30.006
and not the good state of Texas.

30:31.883 --> 30:35.349
Zeke Borns never had a chance.

30:35.349 --> 30:37.090
He was rounded up as a teenager,

30:37.090 --> 30:39.621
thrown in a cell while he was
still doped up on drugs,

30:39.621 --> 30:44.447
browbeaten and interrogated
until his I.Q of 80 was overcome.

30:44.447 --> 30:46.982
He confessed to a crime
he had no memory of,

30:46.982 --> 30:49.212
still has no memory of,

30:49.212 --> 30:50.678
for which there is no evidence,

30:50.678 --> 30:54.747
other than two witnesses who saw him 
pumping gas around the time of the murder.

30:54.747 --> 30:57.337
He was given a coked-up lawyer
who admittedly did nothing.

30:57.337 --> 31:01.120
I'm now before nine presumably
intelligent people in the justice business

31:01.120 --> 31:03.397
who have the benefit
of knowing all of this.

31:03.397 --> 31:06.516
Add to that, you know DNA places
somebody else at the scene,

31:06.516 --> 31:08.248
and you're indifferent!

31:08.248 --> 31:10.413
You don't care!

31:10.413 --> 31:14.843
Whether you believe in my client's
innocence, and I'll assume…

31:14.843 --> 31:17.907
With all due respect, may it please
the court, that you don't.

31:17.907 --> 31:20.298
You cannot be sure of his guilt.

31:20.298 --> 31:23.436
You simply cannot.

31:23.811 --> 31:27.771
And failing that, 
how can you kill him?

31:27.771 --> 31:31.375
How can you kill him?

31:38.812 --> 31:40.710
And I would sincerely, sincerely,

31:40.710 --> 31:44.658
sincerely hope that 
you don't penalize my client

31:44.658 --> 31:48.198
simply because his lawyers
happen to be from Massachusetts.

31:49.441 --> 31:50.887
The home of the New England patriots,

31:50.887 --> 31:54.448
who could kick ass over any football 
team you've got in the good state of Texas,

31:54.448 --> 31:57.638
May it please the court.

32:12.087 --> 32:13.989
I am so sorry.

32:13.989 --> 32:16.647
No, you don't have to apologize.

32:16.647 --> 32:20.153
They gave you nothing.

32:20.270 --> 32:23.931
You had no choice but to 
go with your passion.

32:24.243 --> 32:28.804
Could have left out the slight
on Texas football, but…

32:34.144 --> 32:37.534
You were strong, Alan.

32:39.763 --> 32:42.787
And maybe you reached them.

32:46.996 --> 32:49.009
The court hasn't ruled yet.

32:49.009 --> 32:51.586
Six hours before, 
he goes to Huntsville.

32:51.586 --> 32:54.591
–That's the law.
–What's in Huntsville, bleachers?

32:55.555 --> 32:59.046
The death house.
They put me in the walls unit.

32:59.046 --> 33:02.509
Why move him 
if there's still a chance?

33:05.777 --> 33:08.757
–Jerry?
–No cell phones in here.

33:10.130 --> 33:13.457
Just now?

33:20.965 --> 33:24.420
They turned us down.

33:32.018 --> 33:35.547
Well, let's go then.

33:37.127 --> 33:40.434
–I'm so sorry, Zeke.
–I'm ready, Chelina.

33:40.434 --> 33:43.653
I'm gonna be strong like a hero.
You watch.

33:45.299 --> 33:48.302
Will you watch?

33:49.148 --> 33:53.448
I want people to see me strong.

33:53.982 --> 33:56.896
I got no family.

33:56.896 --> 34:00.405
Will you come?

34:01.186 --> 34:03.324
Sure.

34:03.324 --> 34:05.963
We'll be there.

34:07.743 --> 34:10.565
Let's go, Zeke.

34:19.751 --> 34:22.308
We'll go and see it together.

34:28.513 --> 34:31.797
He bribed the judge?

34:31.797 --> 34:36.699
I can't be sure, but I think
he had some undue influence.

34:38.147 --> 34:40.591
As much as I adore him,

34:40.591 --> 34:45.136
it's only a matter of time
before he brings this place to its knees.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.822
He's the named partner,

34:47.822 --> 34:51.969
the lead named partner.

34:51.969 --> 34:55.335
I think we've gotta take him out.

35:08.355 --> 35:10.456
I get ice cream.

35:10.456 --> 35:14.248
–Chocolate.
–Yeah, you're set.

35:14.248 --> 35:17.514
They said maybe sprinkles.

35:17.514 --> 35:21.405
Guess I don't need
to worry about my cholesterol.

35:29.133 --> 35:32.584
Governor's in Hawaii, unavailable.

35:32.584 --> 35:34.440
There's still hope, however.

35:34.440 --> 35:36.455
I made a few calls,
tracked down a woman I know

35:36.455 --> 35:40.893
who is actually performing in a charity luau
where the governor is scheduled to be,

35:40.893 --> 35:43.256
Polynesian dancer.

35:43.256 --> 35:45.690
So you're saying this whole
thing could come down to…

35:45.690 --> 35:47.914
A hula girl.

35:52.097 --> 35:55.041
I know this girl. 
She's good.

36:01.841 --> 36:04.494
–Zeke.
–Let's do this.

36:04.494 --> 36:07.446
I'm ready to die. I'm strong.

36:09.690 --> 36:12.757
Would you excuse us
for a minute, please?

36:20.488 --> 36:23.272
Zeke, you talked 
about being a hero.

36:23.272 --> 36:28.934
Strong and brave may not
go with hero here.

36:28.934 --> 36:31.243
What do you mean?

36:39.535 --> 36:44.958
The state of Texas wants people
to believe you're a monster.

36:44.958 --> 36:47.932
I think you should show them

36:47.932 --> 36:51.335
you're a human being.

36:51.335 --> 36:58.285
And the human thing 
to do here is be afraid.

36:58.964 --> 37:01.520
If you wanna be a hero,

37:01.520 --> 37:08.731
show people what it really
feels like to be executed.

37:09.106 --> 37:11.849
We're led to believe

37:11.849 --> 37:16.446
it's peaceful, painless,

37:16.446 --> 37:19.435
humane, even.

37:19.435 --> 37:23.073
I think you should fight
to the end, Zeke,

37:23.073 --> 37:27.503
and show your fear.

37:28.566 --> 37:33.041
This is because you're against
the death penalty, right?

37:34.452 --> 37:36.841
Well…

37:36.841 --> 37:40.117
Whether a person is for or 
against the death penalty,

37:40.117 --> 37:44.409
he or she should 
just know what it is.

37:50.139 --> 37:54.429
The best way for you to 
be a hero, Zeke,

37:54.429 --> 37:59.004
is to be human.

38:02.509 --> 38:04.597
I've also included a brief
synopsis of the case history,

38:04.597 --> 38:06.870
should he care to 
peruse it over his Mai Tai.

38:06.870 --> 38:07.888
Excellent, Angela.

38:07.888 --> 38:09.637
You have my number, 
you also have Alan's,

38:09.637 --> 38:13.069
and I've given you Chelina's cell,
and the number at the WLS unit.

38:13.069 --> 38:15.625
Thank you. Aloha.
Make speed.

38:17.764 --> 38:21.189
He's actually petitioning
the Texas governor by way of…

38:21.189 --> 38:22.841
Hula girl.

38:22.841 --> 38:25.604
Justice works in 
strange ways, Paul.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.968
Ask judge Brown.

38:27.968 --> 38:30.059
Did Denny bribe him?

38:30.059 --> 38:32.221
I can only guess.

38:33.774 --> 38:38.849
Tara, do you ever feel sexually
harassed by Denny?

38:38.849 --> 38:40.918
Never.

38:40.918 --> 38:42.832
He never objectifies you?

38:42.832 --> 38:45.559
All men objectify me.

38:45.879 --> 38:48.383
I don't.

38:50.455 --> 38:52.739
I don't!

38:54.143 --> 38:55.880
Hello, Angela?

38:55.880 --> 38:57.808
Yes, without question.

38:57.808 --> 38:59.647
He must be there, Angela.

38:59.647 --> 39:02.991
I got his schedule directly 
from his press secretary's assistant.

39:02.991 --> 39:05.529
You got my fax? In your hand?

39:05.529 --> 39:07.320
Then find the governor, 
get it in his hand.

39:07.320 --> 39:10.675
We have less than 10 minutes.
Maybe 5.

39:14.142 --> 39:16.005
Okay.

39:16.005 --> 39:18.455
No cell phones are 
allowed in here.

39:18.455 --> 39:20.033
How'd you get by with that?

39:20.033 --> 39:24.138
I told the guard we were waiting for
a last-minute call from your conscience.

39:24.138 --> 39:26.436
Collect.

39:26.436 --> 39:28.489
Do you see that guy?

39:28.489 --> 39:31.260
Media. One guy.

39:31.260 --> 39:33.452
It's not even a story.

40:14.245 --> 40:17.759
Do I get to say 
my last words now?

40:18.018 --> 40:20.411
If you like.

40:22.925 --> 40:25.394
It's just…

40:25.394 --> 40:28.536
I don't know if I did it,

40:28.795 --> 40:34.241
but if I did, I'm sorry, you know?

40:41.531 --> 40:44.593
Time to get on now.

40:44.897 --> 40:50.009
Okay. 
Thank you for everything.

40:56.826 --> 40:57.865
No.

40:59.162 --> 41:00.782
Get his legs. Get his legs.

41:02.017 --> 41:03.914
Get his legs.

41:04.179 --> 41:05.813
Get him on there.

41:05.813 --> 41:07.746
I got him.

41:07.887 --> 41:09.835
Right there.
