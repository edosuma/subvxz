00:17.010 --> 00:20.850
<i>A case to end all cases.</i>

00:33.110 --> 00:35.950
<i>You know what I mean, Dinah?</i>

00:36.570 --> 00:39.410
<i>I used to think being</i>
<i>a private detective was cool.</i>

00:39.580 --> 00:42.910
<i>Like Sam Spade</i>
<i>or Phillip Marlowe, right?</i>

00:43.080 --> 00:46.120
<i>But there's nothing cool left to it.</i>

00:47.290 --> 00:52.380
<i>On top of that, both my fridge</i>
<i>and my bank account are empty.</i>

01:02.640 --> 01:03.680
Wait.

01:03.850 --> 01:05.770
Okay, Dinah, let's bet.

01:05.940 --> 01:09.480
If it's another suspicious husband,
I'm out of this business forever.

01:12.070 --> 01:15.860
Hello?
<i>Mr. Ash, I have a job for you.</i>

01:16.030 --> 01:19.620
And you need me
to check on your wife, right?

01:19.780 --> 01:21.950
<i>I'm looking for a computer hacker.</i>

01:22.120 --> 01:25.460
<i>This hacker goes by the alias Trinity.</i>
<i>That's all we know.</i>

01:25.620 --> 01:28.500
Well, it looks like we're still
in business, Dinah.

01:28.670 --> 01:30.960
Fine. And who will I be working for?

01:31.130 --> 01:33.510
<i>- I can't say.</i>
- You can't say.

01:33.670 --> 01:36.800
Call me back when you can say.
That's not the way I do business.

01:36.970 --> 01:38.720
It was a pleasure chatting with you.

01:38.890 --> 01:44.060
<i>Before you hang up, take a look</i>
<i>at your bank account balance.</i>

01:50.730 --> 01:54.030
<i>I didn't get a good feeling</i>
<i>about the case.</i>

01:54.480 --> 01:58.360
<i>But I had no good reason</i>
<i>to turn the guy down now.</i>

01:58.950 --> 02:01.370
<i>This Trinity was well-known</i>
<i>in hacker circles.</i>

02:01.910 --> 02:04.370
<i>A real artist by the sound of it.</i>

02:04.540 --> 02:07.910
<i>The cops were always</i>
<i>one step behind him.</i>

02:08.500 --> 02:12.250
<i>So I knew I could get that close.</i>
<i>Question was, could I get closer?</i>

02:12.420 --> 02:16.260
<i>I had a few tricks up my sleeve</i>
<i>for getting to hackers.</i>

02:17.630 --> 02:22.930
<i>While I was searching,</i>
<i>I found something strange.</i>

02:25.770 --> 02:28.390
<i>Other detectives had been</i>
<i>on the case too.</i>

02:28.560 --> 02:33.900
<i>And their investigations had all been,</i>
<i>shall we say, troubled.</i>

02:34.070 --> 02:35.900
<i>One of the guys killed himself.</i>

02:36.400 --> 02:38.400
<i>Another had disappeared.</i>

02:39.400 --> 02:41.570
<i>Another went crazy.</i>

02:41.990 --> 02:46.040
<i>So I paid the one</i>
<i>who was left a visit.</i>

02:46.540 --> 02:48.620
<i>The crazy one.</i>

02:52.130 --> 02:56.800
Trinity doesn't exist, man.
He's not real.

02:56.960 --> 03:01.970
He's a figment. A cipher.
A jabberwocky.

03:03.300 --> 03:07.600
And who am I? Who the hell am I?

03:14.980 --> 03:17.280
<i>Did I mention he was crazy?</i>

03:21.570 --> 03:25.620
<i>Chessboards, jabberwocky,</i>
<i>Red Queen...</i>

03:25.780 --> 03:28.290
<i>I started searching</i>
<i>all the usual hacker hangouts...</i>

03:28.450 --> 03:31.250
<i>... for someone with</i>
an Alice in Wonderland m.o.

03:31.410 --> 03:34.880
<i>Hacker bulletin boards,</i>
<i>anonymous mailboxes, chat rooms.</i>

03:35.040 --> 03:39.090
<i>And it was in one of those</i>
<i>that I picked up Trinity's trail.</i>

04:46.320 --> 04:48.030
<i>"Six brooks."</i>

04:48.410 --> 04:52.080
<i>"I'll be there at 2005."</i>

04:58.920 --> 05:00.210
Of course!

05:00.380 --> 05:03.300
Crossing the second brook
takes her into the woods.

05:03.460 --> 05:06.260
Alice jumps the first brook...

05:06.430 --> 05:08.220
...and...

05:10.350 --> 05:13.470
And then she boards a train.

05:19.730 --> 05:20.770
Thanks.

05:27.820 --> 05:29.070
Excuse me.

05:30.910 --> 05:32.160
Hey!

05:32.620 --> 05:34.120
Hey!

05:59.270 --> 06:01.480
I knew this was some kind of trap.

06:01.650 --> 06:06.440
There's a difference, Mr. Ash,
between a trap and a test.

06:06.610 --> 06:08.820
You were testing me?

06:08.990 --> 06:12.030
You made it. I'm impressed.

06:12.620 --> 06:15.450
Flattery will get you everywhere.

06:15.620 --> 06:18.460
I'm not here to flatter you,
I'm here to save you.

06:34.810 --> 06:36.640
What just happened?

06:36.810 --> 06:39.810
Mr. Ash, dream of having
an eye exam lately?

06:42.610 --> 06:45.270
Yeah, how'd you know?

06:46.230 --> 06:49.280
You've stepped
to the edge of the looking glass.

06:51.070 --> 06:54.330
So then, that means I wasn't dreaming.

06:57.950 --> 07:02.040
They hired me as a way
of getting to you, didn't they?

07:06.840 --> 07:08.630
Go!

07:29.320 --> 07:33.320
What the hell is going on here?
This is really crazy.

07:33.490 --> 07:36.370
Now I understand what happened
to those other detectives.

07:36.530 --> 07:38.370
They went nuts.

07:41.250 --> 07:44.880
Well, I've gotten out
of worse jams than this.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.920
I am not gonna let them get you.

07:52.630 --> 07:54.760
What's happening to me?

08:00.770 --> 08:02.060
I'm sorry.

08:02.230 --> 08:05.020
You didn't make it, Mr. Ash.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.410
I wish...

08:15.570 --> 08:17.870
...I could go with you.

08:19.120 --> 08:21.120
I don't blame you, you know.

08:21.290 --> 08:24.460
Everything that happened, Trinity,
it was all my fault.

08:27.380 --> 08:31.460
<i>All that Through the Looking Glass stuff.</i>

08:32.919 --> 08:36.220
Can't get my head around it.
I'm old-fashioned.

08:39.890 --> 08:43.600
There's a difference between
a test and a choice.

08:45.730 --> 08:49.110
For what it's worth,
I think you could've handled the truth.

08:52.780 --> 08:54.950
It was just a job.

08:55.110 --> 08:57.410
Goodbye, Trinity.

08:58.030 --> 08:59.780
Goodbye.

09:38.530 --> 09:42.030
<i>A case to end all cases.</i>
