00:16.935 --> 00:20.193
Not just the lid.
The entire can.

00:20.217 --> 00:22.439
Uhh!

00:22.507 --> 00:25.488
Doc, we've been at this
for 5 hours straight.

00:25.504 --> 00:27.144
How about a lunch break?!

00:31.315 --> 00:33.816
Take 20 minutes.

00:35.218 --> 00:37.986
<i>You heard me!
I'm sick and tired of the testing!</i>

00:38.009 --> 00:40.591
<i>- We all are!
- M'ijo, we must continue.</i>

00:40.623 --> 00:43.903
- They're at it again.
- Why?! Just to prove your theory?

00:43.934 --> 00:48.324
<i>Si</i>, Eduardo. I spent two decades
working on my Zeta beam technology

00:48.347 --> 00:50.724
and now my son has
teleportation powers?

00:50.725 --> 00:52.859
This cannot be
a coincidence.

00:54.726 --> 00:59.887
The meta gene that Reach activated
inside you must be opportunistic,

00:59.895 --> 01:03.246
taking advantage of whatever
is present in the subject's system.

01:03.262 --> 01:08.415
Only the subject doesn't care!
I want a cure, not an explanation!

01:08.482 --> 01:10.884
You have only
yourself to blame.

01:10.951 --> 01:12.352
None of this
would have happened

01:12.420 --> 01:15.542
if you hadn't run away from your
<i>abuelo</i>'s home in Argentina.

01:15.565 --> 01:17.924
I thought I wanted
to be with my father.

01:17.992 --> 01:20.694
What a mistake
that turned out to be.

01:25.199 --> 01:27.980
Uh, hey, Ed, we were
just passing by.

01:27.996 --> 01:29.458
Didn't hear a thing.

01:29.489 --> 01:32.218
Doesn't matter.
Same old, same old.

01:32.257 --> 01:34.742
Come on. Only have about
12 minutes left for lunch,

01:34.774 --> 01:37.522
and you know how Doc Wilcox
get when we're late.

01:37.717 --> 01:41.583
This is so messed up. STAR's as bad
as <i>the Reach</i> and worse than home.

01:41.603 --> 01:44.220
Tye, there's no way
this is as bad as <i>the Reach</i>.

01:44.287 --> 01:48.258
Whatever, Newt. I just know
I can't take much more of this place.

01:48.325 --> 01:53.162
You won't have to.
'Cause we're bustin' out tonight.

02:11.648 --> 02:15.250
The crates from the League have arrived
for temporary storage in our vault.

02:15.318 --> 02:20.693
Amazo body parts, salvaged from the
Hall of Justice after it was destroyed.

02:24.827 --> 02:26.361
That's enough for today.

02:26.370 --> 02:29.914
We'll begin again promptly
at 06.00 hours tomorrow.

02:32.395 --> 02:35.970
[speaking Japanese]

02:36.038 --> 02:37.857
<i>Domo.</i>

02:39.541 --> 02:42.476
Please, tell me you're
not serious about running.

02:42.505 --> 02:45.856
Running, escaping, whatever
you want to call it, we're gone.

02:49.150 --> 02:52.318
This is serious. I nearly
blew up Central City.

02:52.386 --> 02:55.190
My powers may be gone now,
but what if they come back,

02:55.222 --> 02:57.432
<i>you know, escalate out of
control all over again?</i>

02:57.440 --> 03:01.127
What if your powers escalate?
Dude, you can't control them now.

03:01.195 --> 03:04.245
Look, I know Wilcox
is a pain.

03:04.268 --> 03:07.568
STAR is a pain, but they're trying
to keep us safe.

03:07.636 --> 03:10.771
Or at least keep the world
safe from us.

03:11.251 --> 03:12.606
I'm outta here.

03:12.624 --> 03:14.351
- Oh, yeah.
- <i>Adios</i>.

03:15.185 --> 03:17.690
- Are you coming, Sam?
- [speaking Japanese]

03:17.705 --> 03:19.586
That might mean "yes".

03:22.284 --> 03:26.740
Sorry.
But I can't let you do this.

03:29.402 --> 03:30.805
Let's go.

03:33.930 --> 03:36.411
The alarm's put the whole place
on lockdown.

03:36.434 --> 03:38.757
- Great! Now, what?
- No idea.

03:38.772 --> 03:40.466
Well, what was
your escape plan?

03:40.505 --> 03:45.190
I... I didn't actually have a chance
to come up with a plan, but...

03:45.221 --> 03:48.778
- Hey, Ed can teleport us out.
- Haven't you been paying attention?

03:48.846 --> 03:52.167
I can only teleport myself
and only along sight lines.

03:52.191 --> 03:57.236
Which makes escaping from a windowless,
locked hallway somewhat difficult!

03:57.268 --> 03:59.522
No problem.
Tye will do his thing.

03:59.523 --> 04:02.000
He'll take the roof off the building
and pull us all out, right?

04:02.006 --> 04:05.720
Wrong. I don't know how to activate
"my thing". It just happens.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.646
[speaking Japanese]

04:08.957 --> 04:10.828
You kids need
to come with us.

04:12.113 --> 04:13.625
Don't think so.

04:14.791 --> 04:16.360
Behind you...!

04:22.173 --> 04:25.924
- Listen! This is for your own good!
- Heard that before.

04:27.084 --> 04:28.502
Uhh!

04:31.497 --> 04:34.558
- OK, now what?
- No idea.

04:35.974 --> 04:39.367
What if it's a power outage?
Hey, maybe I blew the circuit.

04:39.398 --> 04:40.856
Yeah, I don't think so.

04:40.899 --> 04:42.395
[speaking Japanese]

04:43.835 --> 04:46.270
Hey, no power, no lockdown.

04:46.338 --> 04:47.706
Sam, you're a genius.

04:47.739 --> 04:49.140
[speaking Japanese]

04:49.208 --> 04:50.815
Never mind.
Let's go.

04:53.379 --> 04:56.615
Look, Nightwing, I'm not
too comfortable with this.

04:56.683 --> 05:00.425
- One of those STAR kids is my buddy Tye.
<i>- Actually, I'm counting on that.</i>

05:00.453 --> 05:02.805
<i>You can talk to him,
convince him that right now,</i>

05:02.828 --> 05:06.426
<i>until we kick the Reach off world,
STAR is the safest place for them.</i>

05:07.776 --> 05:10.165
OK. I'm on it.

05:25.627 --> 05:27.955
Dude, I can't believe
you called your family.

05:27.996 --> 05:29.850
No way I'm going back to mine.

05:29.880 --> 05:34.454
Look, I know that <i>Reach</i> was abducting
runaways, but with me, they got it wrong.

05:34.521 --> 05:37.189
I was grabbed while waiting
at a train station to meet my sister.

05:37.256 --> 05:40.759
My folks and I, we're good,
and they must be worried sick.

05:40.827 --> 05:42.260
So, yeah, I called them.

05:42.328 --> 05:44.262
I left a voicemail
asking them to wire money

05:44.289 --> 05:46.664
so the 4 of us can buy
bus tickets to Dakota City.

05:46.665 --> 05:48.799
- It's my hometown.
- That's your plan?

05:48.845 --> 05:52.003
How are we supposed to find
a cure in Dakota City?

05:52.071 --> 05:56.174
No idea. Except I don't
really want a cure.

05:58.744 --> 06:00.566
I like my powers.

06:01.379 --> 06:04.541
- Dude, don't drink that! It's <i>Reach!</i>
- Ptoo!

06:05.077 --> 06:06.808
Ah, man...!

06:08.250 --> 06:11.115
Just wake me when
it's time to go.

06:19.698 --> 06:22.158
[speaking Japanese]

06:24.050 --> 06:25.472
I have no idea.

06:27.940 --> 06:29.507
Uhh!

06:32.211 --> 06:36.047
- <i>Companero</i>, Wilcox is here.
- Oh, great.

06:37.683 --> 06:40.052
Tye, Tye! Wake up, man.
We're in trouble.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.369
This was not
in the briefing.

07:03.376 --> 07:08.747
He... he's never manifested
in astral form this large.

07:11.006 --> 07:14.752
Wait! Hold your fire! We're here
to protect them, remember?

07:15.593 --> 07:21.034
Ah, OK.
Not what I expected, but...

07:21.185 --> 07:24.829
Everyone stay calm.
The situation is under control.

07:37.823 --> 07:41.960
- Uh! Tye!
- I don't think he can hear you.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.990
Wait! Tye, stop!

07:50.228 --> 07:53.137
Go back to STAR.
I'll handle this.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.256
- Come on, man, wake up.
- Tye!

08:08.273 --> 08:10.108
How'd I get...

08:10.114 --> 08:13.482
Ohh, it happened again.
I thought I was dreaming.

08:13.483 --> 08:15.315
No dream. Trust me.

08:16.903 --> 08:20.442
I'm not here to hurt you.
But you 4 need to go back to STAR.

08:20.497 --> 08:23.705
Look, I recognize you.
I know you're one of the good guys,

08:23.728 --> 08:25.960
one of the heroes that saved
us all from <i>the Reach</i>.

08:26.028 --> 08:31.033
- But, dude, you just don't get it.
- No, Tye, I really do.

08:33.001 --> 08:35.736
- Jaime?
- Yeah, it's me.

08:35.804 --> 08:37.857
- But how?
<i>- It's a long story.</i>

08:37.889 --> 08:39.851
But it started
with this scarab.

08:39.875 --> 08:43.679
It was created by <i>the Reach</i>
to both give me powers and control me.

08:43.746 --> 08:46.882
So believe me, <i>ese</i>,
I get it.

08:47.366 --> 08:49.436
Fine. You're one of us.

08:49.460 --> 08:52.434
Except you're flying around
free as a... Beetle,

08:52.471 --> 08:55.026
and you still expect us
to be lab rats for STAR.

08:55.057 --> 08:58.026
No more, <i>hermano</i>.
Not for <i>the Reach</i> or STAR.

08:58.094 --> 09:00.934
He's right, bro. You
can't take us back there.

09:02.215 --> 09:04.199
Tye, what's the alternative?

09:04.208 --> 09:06.969
I let you run loose until
<i>the Reach</i> snatches you up again?

09:07.036 --> 09:09.835
No. We're headed to my
parents' place, so they can...

09:09.866 --> 09:13.442
Get hurt or killed trying
to protect you? That's your plan?

09:13.843 --> 09:15.984
[speaking Japanese]

09:16.058 --> 09:18.693
<i>Hai.</i>
I'll help you.

09:18.913 --> 09:23.785
- Dude, you speak Japanese?
- The scarab translates. Don't ask.

09:23.805 --> 09:27.143
All right, new plan.
I have this buddy, Green Beetle.

09:27.159 --> 09:29.530
He helped me. I think
he can help you, too.

09:29.554 --> 09:31.881
He's not far from here.
I'll take you.

09:39.669 --> 09:44.004
You abandoned the search for my son
and expect me not to worry?! Rrr!

09:44.043 --> 09:46.241
Why did I let you
talk me out of going?

09:46.309 --> 09:50.813
Because, Doctor, you know Eduardo Jr. has
a history of running <i>away</i> from family.

09:50.881 --> 09:53.924
Blue Beetle will find the
children and bring them back.

09:56.354 --> 09:58.121
Ah!

10:06.095 --> 10:08.820
Greetings, meat bags.

10:08.977 --> 10:11.498
First things first.

10:14.138 --> 10:19.001
Didn't want any Leaguers arriving
via Zeta tube, now, did we?

10:20.158 --> 10:22.980
Where's Amazo?

10:25.350 --> 10:30.233
- Nightwing. <i>Â¿Que pasa?
- Blue, your radio's down.</i>

10:30.249 --> 10:32.706
Kind of incognito
at the moment, <i>ese</i>.

10:32.730 --> 10:37.460
<i>Well, armor up. The robot Red Volcano is
attacking STAR to steal the body parts</i>

10:37.461 --> 10:41.085
<i>of an android called Amazo,
probably to incorporate its tech.</i>

10:41.086 --> 10:44.367
<i>And since Amazo was capable of duplicating
the powers of the Justice League,</i>

10:44.435 --> 10:46.102
<i>we can't let Volcano succeed.</i>

10:46.170 --> 10:50.631
But I'm on the runaway teen thing.
I've, uh, almost tracked them down.

10:50.662 --> 10:53.041
<i>That can wait.
Zeta tube's offline,</i>

10:53.065 --> 10:55.598
<i>so only Flash and Impulse
could get there fast enough.</i>

10:55.606 --> 10:58.134
And they're both rescuing
tsunami victims in Rulaysia.

10:58.135 --> 11:00.572
You're the only one close.
Nightwing out.

11:00.627 --> 11:03.269
- Minor setback.
- We heard.

11:03.300 --> 11:06.956
- The volume on your phone's maxed out.
- Oh. OK.

11:07.024 --> 11:11.540
Look, stay put and stay out of sight.
I'll be back soon.

11:14.031 --> 11:17.701
- My dad could be in trouble.
- Dude, you hate your dad.

11:17.729 --> 11:20.356
- O-only sometimes.
- Hey, it's cool.

11:20.364 --> 11:24.266
If it were my dad, nothing
would keep me away. I'm with you.

11:24.297 --> 11:28.077
So you two want to go back to
the exact place we just escaped from.

11:28.145 --> 11:31.957
Whatever.
I'm in, too.

11:32.383 --> 11:33.889
Sam?

11:35.833 --> 11:40.140
[speaking Japanese]

11:46.497 --> 11:50.567
Um... It doesn't look like
an evil robot's attacking.

11:54.972 --> 11:57.340
- Aah!
- Aah!

12:18.688 --> 12:20.029
Jaime...

12:31.546 --> 12:33.761
We have to save
Blue Beetle!

12:34.449 --> 12:37.117
How? I can't teleport
where I can't see,

12:37.185 --> 12:39.386
and your powers wouldn't be
of any use either.

12:39.454 --> 12:42.455
I'll save Jaime. You guys
just follow the robot.

12:42.523 --> 12:44.749
Make sure no one else
gets hurt.

12:45.659 --> 12:47.162
Go!

12:48.067 --> 12:50.652
OK, I can do this.

12:50.691 --> 12:54.293
Grandpa's been trying to teach
me focus since I was 8.

12:54.767 --> 12:56.201
Breathe...

12:56.268 --> 12:57.702
He'd say...

12:57.762 --> 13:01.383
Breathe... And be.

13:17.821 --> 13:19.686
No head.

13:20.055 --> 13:22.289
Where's Amazo's head?!

13:22.333 --> 13:27.003
<i>No se</i>. The Justice League sent the head
to another location as insurance.

13:27.345 --> 13:31.474
Then I'll take your head
as compensation.

13:36.201 --> 13:39.543
You teleported...
With another person?

13:39.568 --> 13:41.291
I was...

13:41.316 --> 13:43.316
Motivated.

13:44.151 --> 13:46.835
It hurts.

13:47.845 --> 13:51.623
- We'll run interference.
- Will you, now?

13:59.858 --> 14:01.458
Aah!

14:04.530 --> 14:08.133
My turn, meat bags.

14:12.698 --> 14:15.200
That's it, Tye!
Now pull!

14:28.563 --> 14:31.010
Burning plasma. Really.

14:31.018 --> 14:34.330
You don't seem to have grasped
whom you're dealing with.

14:34.353 --> 14:37.535
The name is Volcano!

14:40.520 --> 14:41.954
Aah!

14:53.453 --> 14:57.136
You don't seem to have grasped
what you're dealing with either.

15:01.225 --> 15:04.496
Didn't like that?
How about we up the decibels?

15:20.581 --> 15:21.781
Beetle, stop!

15:21.782 --> 15:24.417
Volume's still maxed out
and there are people in there.

15:24.452 --> 15:26.120
First things first.

15:33.221 --> 15:35.213
Just how well
do you know this guy?

15:35.236 --> 15:38.599
Hey, Jaime's fighting an evil
robot, cut him some. OK?

15:38.667 --> 15:40.968
Whatever. We got
bystanders to save.

15:48.608 --> 15:52.178
Wait, Asami.
<i>Mi hijo</i>. My son.

15:52.246 --> 15:56.337
[speaking Japanese]

15:57.857 --> 15:59.657
This way!

16:00.582 --> 16:03.808
- Thanks. Glad you came back.
- It's temporary.

16:25.147 --> 16:29.516
Virgil. Asami-san.
<i>Domo</i>. Thank you.

16:33.540 --> 16:35.805
I think
we got everyone out.

16:47.372 --> 16:50.241
- Aah! - Uhh!
- Uhh!

16:50.309 --> 16:55.583
Time to sacrifice your victory and
save the meat bags like a good hero.

16:55.629 --> 16:57.920
You shouldn't stereotype.

17:10.222 --> 17:12.857
Your friend was
going to sacrifice us.

17:21.186 --> 17:24.599
You'll have to do
better than that, meat bag.

17:24.651 --> 17:27.615
I'm really more
of a meat <i>box</i>.

17:30.216 --> 17:34.954
And you...
You're just scrap.

17:56.054 --> 17:58.744
Done. Now we need to get you
to Green Beetle.

17:58.812 --> 18:02.602
- Jaime, I'm not sure...
- Tye, this is not up for debate.

18:02.614 --> 18:04.163
We need to go now!

18:04.186 --> 18:06.642
- Excuse me!
- A question... What happened here?

18:06.657 --> 18:08.227
- How about a few words?
- Who are you?

18:08.235 --> 18:12.561
- What's your <i>nom de guerre?</i>
- I'm... Blue Beetle.

18:12.577 --> 18:15.027
- You're Blue Beetle?
- Haven't see you around lately.

18:15.044 --> 18:16.428
Loving the new look.

18:21.668 --> 18:25.764
I was happy to help, of course.
That's why I'm here.

18:28.944 --> 18:31.575
I was still hot from battle
and overplayed my hand.

18:31.601 --> 18:34.994
Really, I should've summoned you to pick
them up the moment I made contact.

18:35.017 --> 18:39.385
You were attempting to win their trust
and increase their dependence.

18:39.416 --> 18:43.370
It was a sensible tactic.
We will find them again in time.

18:43.392 --> 18:45.734
Of course the timing of the
robot's attack didn't help.

18:45.771 --> 18:50.690
On the contrary, It helped establish
your public profile as a true hero.

18:50.722 --> 18:53.487
<i>Which is easily
as important</i>

18:53.542 --> 18:57.994
as Green rebooted your scarab
to control <i>the meat</i> inside.

18:58.033 --> 19:01.844
So you must control
the natives of this world,

19:01.911 --> 19:04.880
enlarging <i>the Reach</i>'s
foothold in the Galaxy.

19:04.948 --> 19:06.883
Don't worry, my brothers.

19:06.950 --> 19:10.220
<i>The meat</i> will soon
be eating out of your hands,

19:10.287 --> 19:14.424
or else
they will not eat at all.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.865
Is it really a good idea
to come back here?

19:17.886 --> 19:20.627
It's brilliant. It's the one
place they'd never think to look.

19:20.665 --> 19:23.567
- I mean, not a second time.
- I'm done running.

19:23.634 --> 19:26.136
<i>Yo tambien</i>.
So now what?

19:26.843 --> 19:30.073
- [All:] No idea.
<i>- Sumimasen</i>.

19:32.977 --> 19:35.846
<i>Sumimasen</i>. That means
"trouble", doesn't it?

19:35.914 --> 19:38.315
No idea.

19:38.658 --> 19:43.442
It seems that sending Red Volcano
to attack STAR worked out marvelously...

19:43.467 --> 19:45.467
Now, to seal the deal...

19:50.227 --> 19:53.608
- Hey, you're Lex Luthor.
- In the flesh.

19:53.666 --> 19:57.702
And you would be
Virgil Hawkins, Asami Koizumi,

19:57.737 --> 20:00.138
<i>Eduardo Dorado,
and Tye Longshadow.</i>

20:00.206 --> 20:03.146
- You know us?
- Know you? Heh.

20:03.169 --> 20:06.345
My boy, I've been watching
over you for weeks.

20:06.412 --> 20:10.348
Even arranged the power outage that
facilitated your escape from STAR.

20:10.416 --> 20:12.718
Not to mention the timely
arrival of the press,

20:12.741 --> 20:15.119
which enabled you
to evade Blue Beetle,

20:15.187 --> 20:19.556
who, as you may have guessed,
has become an agent of <i>the Reach</i>.

20:19.624 --> 20:25.690
But... You work with <i>the Reach</i>.
You make their <i>refresco</i>, their beverage.

20:25.705 --> 20:30.901
True. But I've come to suspect they've
been using me for their own ends.

20:30.968 --> 20:34.438
And I think you know
what that feels like.

20:35.239 --> 20:38.032
It's a dangerous world.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.543
Fortunately, I have
the resources to protect you.

20:40.611 --> 20:43.345
Yeah, I heard that before.
What do you want?

20:43.413 --> 20:45.080
To empower you.

20:45.148 --> 20:48.083
Not meta powers. You're doing
just fine on that front.

20:48.151 --> 20:50.217
Instead, I want to help
the 4 of you

20:50.220 --> 20:53.337
finally take control
of your own destinies.

20:53.623 --> 20:56.325
[speaking Japanese]

20:56.393 --> 21:00.295
- Ah. <i>Domo...?</i>
- There is no pressure, my friends.

21:00.363 --> 21:03.465
I'm not going to make you do
anything you don't want to do.

21:03.533 --> 21:06.268
But I'm hoping
you can trust me.

21:06.336 --> 21:08.197
<i>What do you say?</i>
