01:05.159 --> 01:06.525
Retreat!

01:06.526 --> 01:07.758
Retreat!

01:07.759 --> 01:09.892
Retreat!

01:16.934 --> 01:18.466
Go!

01:18.492 --> 01:20.826
Go, come on!

01:25.842 --> 01:28.639
The artillery has no
powder, no ammunition.

01:28.640 --> 01:30.317
Second battalion is gone.

01:30.443 --> 01:32.576
We've got nothing left to throw at them.

01:37.210 --> 01:38.939
- Hold your position.
- Where are you going?

01:38.940 --> 01:40.640
Athos!

01:56.050 --> 01:56.990
What the devil are you doing here?

01:56.991 --> 01:58.190
Get back to your men.

01:59.857 --> 02:01.156
My men have been butchered.

02:01.157 --> 02:03.490
You're sending sword against cannon.

02:03.698 --> 02:05.864
You will hold the line
at all costs, Captain.

02:05.865 --> 02:08.342
- We have to take the field.
- Our cannon are useless.

02:08.368 --> 02:10.133
Where is the powder we were promised?

02:10.133 --> 02:12.333
The supply wagon did not arrive.

02:12.334 --> 02:15.257
You will have to advance
without artillery support.

02:15.258 --> 02:17.391
There won't be a man left alive.

02:18.423 --> 02:21.134
You are soldiers,
the king's own regiment.

02:21.160 --> 02:23.090
Now, go out there and die for him.

02:24.031 --> 02:26.330
That is your strategy?

02:26.527 --> 02:28.560
To watch good men slaughtered?

02:29.222 --> 02:31.187
Return to your men, Captain,

02:31.360 --> 02:34.060
or I will have you court-martialed.

02:39.937 --> 02:41.428
Cut him down!

02:42.657 --> 02:44.896
I shall be in my tent, Chief Adjutant.

03:09.765 --> 03:13.064
Grimaud. Impossible. You can't be here.

03:13.090 --> 03:16.089
I will get you your money, I swear it!

03:16.090 --> 03:18.789
You think you can hide from me?

03:18.790 --> 03:22.856
Even on the battlefield,
I will find you.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.499
The only way out of here
is to take out that cannon.

03:35.438 --> 03:37.557
- We need a plan.
- Attack.

03:37.558 --> 03:39.724
- What?
- I hate it when he does that.

03:42.725 --> 03:45.158
Attack!

04:32.460 --> 04:34.026
Powder!

04:34.027 --> 04:36.460
Shoot the powder!

05:23.911 --> 05:25.224
D'Artagnan. D'Artagnan.

05:48.579 --> 05:49.399
It's over.

06:00.575 --> 06:01.309
Spanish.

06:54.934 --> 06:56.407
There.

06:56.408 --> 06:58.687
You can see the troops moving.

06:58.688 --> 07:00.521
The battle's over.

07:00.523 --> 07:02.430
You see the banner there?

07:02.431 --> 07:04.630
A French victory.

07:10.618 --> 07:12.724
- Who will you be, Marie?
- Porthos.

07:12.787 --> 07:15.726
Oh, I'll be D'Artagnan.

07:16.887 --> 07:19.487
You won't kill me with my armour on.

07:29.352 --> 07:31.212
I told you not to come this way.

07:31.213 --> 07:32.788
We wanted to see the battle.

07:32.789 --> 07:34.421
War is not a game.

07:34.422 --> 07:36.929
Everyone, gather round. Come here.

07:36.930 --> 07:38.602
Drop your stick, Marie.

07:38.603 --> 07:40.370
Come here. We're leaving.

07:42.070 --> 07:43.552
What's that?

07:43.578 --> 07:45.925
It's my fleur-de-lis. I'm a musketeer.

07:46.668 --> 07:48.242
When we get back,
you're taking that off.

07:48.243 --> 07:49.908
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

07:49.909 --> 07:51.342
Then don't behave like one.

07:51.343 --> 07:53.275
Come, we're late for your
lessons, come on.

07:53.276 --> 07:57.243
How could you ever understand?
You're only a monk.

09:05.427 --> 09:06.234
What's wrong?

09:06.235 --> 09:09.308
A man, a figure.

09:10.179 --> 09:12.532
Only the crows have any
business down there.

09:16.666 --> 09:19.531
I'd give anything to be back
in Paris right now.

09:29.813 --> 09:32.146
Ooh!

09:57.558 --> 09:59.525
Finish him!

10:05.090 --> 10:08.623
You want to fight so badly,
I can send you to the fronts.

10:11.216 --> 10:14.899
Isn't there enough violence and
brutality in the world without this?

10:14.900 --> 10:16.809
Clairmont, why have you come here?

10:16.810 --> 10:20.534
A little innocent amusement,
Minister Treville, nothing more.

10:20.612 --> 10:22.344
Feron.

10:22.345 --> 10:24.337
I should have guessed
you were behind this.

10:24.363 --> 10:27.384
Come now, the Red Guard
and the Musketeers

10:27.410 --> 10:29.909
have always maintained
a healthy rivalry.

10:30.034 --> 10:32.969
These are cadets, and you pit
them against trained soldiers.

10:32.970 --> 10:36.814
That one really does need
a little more training.

10:37.132 --> 10:38.932
Run along, boy!

10:39.948 --> 10:42.845
Hide inside the skirts
of Madam D'Artagnan.

10:42.939 --> 10:44.179
Being governor of Paris

10:44.180 --> 10:46.501
does not give you the right
to treat the Red Guard

10:46.502 --> 10:47.991
as your own personal thugs.

10:47.992 --> 10:50.592
Terrorizing, persecuting the people.

10:53.598 --> 10:56.031
We are at war, Treville.

10:56.955 --> 11:01.604
This city breeds
insurrection, revolution.

11:01.605 --> 11:06.371
The Red Guard are all that
stand between us and anarchy.

11:06.786 --> 11:09.443
Now, why don't you take
your infant Musketeer,

11:09.444 --> 11:11.942
go home and tuck him in nicely?

11:11.944 --> 11:14.349
It must be near his bed time.

11:19.377 --> 11:21.344
Come on.

11:28.344 --> 11:30.877
What's next?!

11:31.066 --> 11:33.941
- General!
- What do you want here?

11:34.190 --> 11:37.122
Hey.

11:37.123 --> 11:39.293
We just lost half our regiment

11:39.319 --> 11:41.554
because we didn't get
the support that we were promised.

11:41.580 --> 11:45.647
Good men wasted. Where's the general?

11:49.467 --> 11:52.399
You don't understand. I don't know, sir.

11:52.425 --> 11:54.108
He sent me for the maps
so that we could trace the route

11:54.134 --> 11:56.737
of the artillery supplies, then
he just rode off with someone.

11:56.984 --> 11:58.417
A soldier?

11:58.443 --> 12:00.909
No, he did not leave
of his own volition.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.720
Show us.

12:02.827 --> 12:05.427
The weapons transport was last
reported on the road from Douai.

12:05.428 --> 12:06.961
The general rode in that direction.

12:06.963 --> 12:09.096
Not all of him.

12:12.429 --> 12:14.729
Find some horses.

12:35.483 --> 12:37.648
Stop! No further!

12:37.649 --> 12:41.215
General Lantier.
What are you doing here, sir?

12:41.216 --> 12:44.692
We have the powder consignment.
We broke a wheel on the road.

12:45.683 --> 12:48.783
General, you're injured.

12:50.124 --> 12:53.104
Salute a superior officer!

12:53.105 --> 12:56.371
And the rest of you! Do as I say!

13:00.333 --> 13:02.293
Take cover!

13:08.192 --> 13:10.692
Don't move.

13:17.832 --> 13:21.064
There you are, Luc!

13:21.656 --> 13:23.155
Excuse us, gentlemen.

13:23.810 --> 13:25.924
I'm sorry if the children's
play has disturbed you.

13:25.925 --> 13:27.053
We must get back to the monastery.

13:27.054 --> 13:28.721
Hold!

13:30.186 --> 13:31.950
They're so young and excitable.

13:31.951 --> 13:33.614
I found him, children!

13:34.465 --> 13:37.398
Never pay attention to anything
that goes on around them.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.399
They see nothing.

13:52.967 --> 13:55.000
Good day.

13:57.232 --> 13:59.531
Look straight ahead. Don't run.

13:59.532 --> 14:01.965
Slowly now.

14:12.799 --> 14:14.883
For God's sake.

14:14.884 --> 14:17.283
I've done what you wanted.

14:17.284 --> 14:20.228
Take the weapons, sell them.

14:20.549 --> 14:22.715
The monastery must be close.

14:22.716 --> 14:26.049
We hide the powder there until I contact
the Spanish buyers at the border.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.716
Take the children.

14:41.355 --> 14:42.371
Our soldiers.

14:43.060 --> 14:45.256
Those men just shot them down.
We can't leave.

14:45.281 --> 14:46.326
Luc...

14:46.351 --> 14:48.738
Look, you may have no stomach for it
but there might be men left alive.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.763
You're frightening the children.

14:54.848 --> 14:56.020
Come.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.217
We should leave the
monastery immediately

15:02.218 --> 15:03.757
for the sake of the children.

15:03.758 --> 15:05.190
The children, yes.

15:05.191 --> 15:07.780
It is past the hour
for their lessons, brother.

15:07.781 --> 15:09.280
With the greatest of respect, Abbott,

15:09.281 --> 15:11.073
you do not realize the danger.

15:11.074 --> 15:12.407
Those men were not soldiers.

15:12.409 --> 15:15.460
What I saw on the road
was cold-blooded murder.

15:15.461 --> 15:17.527
We cannot protect ourselves
here, not alone.

15:17.528 --> 15:19.293
We are never alone, brother.

15:19.957 --> 15:22.340
We have the best protection
in the world.

15:22.341 --> 15:25.306
God watches over us.

15:25.307 --> 15:28.635
I have seen violent
men like this before.

15:28.636 --> 15:32.144
You live too much in the world
and in your own past.

15:32.145 --> 15:33.774
I have given my life to God.

15:33.775 --> 15:37.849
Yet you tend your beard
as another might a rose bush.

15:38.016 --> 15:42.149
And here you are speaking
like a soldier again.

15:43.367 --> 15:46.999
Abbott, forgive me,
but you do not understand.

15:48.234 --> 15:49.699
I think I do.

15:50.353 --> 15:53.799
I've become very fond of you over
these past few years, Aramis.

15:53.800 --> 15:57.965
Your company pleases me... but your soul

15:58.024 --> 16:00.585
is as restless and confused as it was

16:00.807 --> 16:02.943
on the day that you arrived here.

16:02.944 --> 16:04.092
You've been looking for something

16:04.093 --> 16:07.358
you may never find
in a life of contemplation.

16:08.584 --> 16:10.026
If these men come here,

16:10.511 --> 16:13.970
then we shall welcome
them with God's love.

16:13.971 --> 16:15.804
His will be done.

16:16.611 --> 16:19.144
Now, tend to your charges.

16:21.026 --> 16:23.510
The Red Guard are out of control.

16:24.715 --> 16:26.558
They persecute and brutalize

16:26.583 --> 16:29.562
ordinary citizens while the
real criminals run free.

16:30.328 --> 16:31.587
Governor Feron must impose

16:32.130 --> 16:34.805
discipline on his men and
order on the streets.

16:35.229 --> 16:36.081
Am I late?

16:37.507 --> 16:39.998
But not as late as the king apparently.

16:40.339 --> 16:46.017
Then, his majesty seldom
serves before 2:00 these days.

16:47.508 --> 16:50.283
Go on Treville, you were saying...

16:51.885 --> 16:53.507
Something has to be done,

16:55.223 --> 16:57.027
and I'm not doing it.

16:57.502 --> 17:01.746
The list of things you're not doing,
Feron, grows longer by the day.

17:02.111 --> 17:05.577
It is a little early to be
challenged to a duel, Treville.

17:05.602 --> 17:07.406
Even on words.

17:07.431 --> 17:09.171
Is there no refreshment nook?

17:09.195 --> 17:12.157
Boy! A man may die of thirst.

17:12.184 --> 17:14.184
It's not just the Red Guard.

17:14.605 --> 17:16.988
Parts of Paris are
becoming ungovernable.

17:17.012 --> 17:18.895
Thieves, cutthroats, userers

17:18.896 --> 17:21.963
and they describe themselves
as men of commerce.

17:22.204 --> 17:23.787
As long as they pay their taxes,

17:23.788 --> 17:25.714
surely their commerce
is their own affair.

17:25.740 --> 17:28.760
Even if it is extortion, murder?

17:30.995 --> 17:33.194
There has always been a market for that.

17:33.483 --> 17:35.652
Well, as his majesty has once again

17:35.678 --> 17:38.161
decided not to grace
us with his presence,

17:38.411 --> 17:40.186
I suggest we adjourn.

17:40.352 --> 17:42.352
I am not finished.

17:42.736 --> 17:44.736
Not yet perhaps, but soon.

17:46.045 --> 17:48.412
Another day, Treville. Another day.

18:03.224 --> 18:05.724
Open the gates.

18:06.538 --> 18:08.262
Come, brothers, open the gates.

18:12.986 --> 18:14.562
We seek shelter, brother.

18:14.864 --> 18:16.163
We were attacked on the road.

18:16.434 --> 18:17.729
You are welcome.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.497
Let them in, brothers.

18:38.814 --> 18:40.379
I do not understand.

18:40.769 --> 18:43.502
You said you were attacked.

18:43.503 --> 18:45.435
Have you any wounded?

18:45.460 --> 18:48.052
There will be others
coming, Spanish soldiers.

18:48.077 --> 18:52.148
Keep your counsel, do as I say
and we will leave you in peace.

18:52.678 --> 18:54.745
What is the meaning of this deception?

18:54.770 --> 18:56.770
What is it you are carrying?

18:58.675 --> 19:03.433
You cannot bring weapons and
gunpowder into a sanctuary of God.

19:03.458 --> 19:05.458
You must leave this moment.

19:09.134 --> 19:10.997
Open the gates!

19:16.142 --> 19:17.905
Stand aside.

19:18.907 --> 19:21.674
I will do it myself.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.676
Get back inside.

19:41.126 --> 19:42.973
Detain the friars in the chapel.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.908
If any resist, kill them.

19:46.548 --> 19:48.448
Bring the general to me.

19:57.789 --> 19:59.321
Push, push, push.

19:59.769 --> 20:01.450
Good boy, there we are.

20:01.548 --> 20:03.223
So, did we all understand?

20:03.249 --> 20:04.864
Right, move, move, move.

20:04.890 --> 20:05.848
Go, go.

20:05.874 --> 20:09.074
- Are we coming back?
- Of course we will.

20:15.964 --> 20:19.230
Come here, come here. Give me your hat.

20:19.982 --> 20:22.314
Come here.

20:22.315 --> 20:24.547
Give me your jacket. Come on.

20:24.548 --> 20:25.815
There you are.

20:26.643 --> 20:30.726
My favourite part of the
battle is always its end.

20:30.727 --> 20:32.990
When there's only the dead left...

20:34.461 --> 20:36.961
with their secrets.

20:43.820 --> 20:46.327
That's when the real struggle starts.

20:46.328 --> 20:49.566
Fight for the spoils.

20:49.567 --> 20:51.821
Now, General...

20:51.822 --> 20:56.521
are you spoils, or just one of the dead?

20:56.523 --> 21:00.186
I am not going to beg for mercy of you.

21:00.187 --> 21:04.687
You are no more than Paris street trash.

21:25.692 --> 21:30.958
So, do we remember the games of
hide and go seek we sometimes play?

21:30.991 --> 21:33.549
We're going to play
one of those games right now.

21:33.550 --> 21:38.888
But we all have to be
very, very quiet. Shh.

21:39.595 --> 21:41.894
I don't got my shoes.

21:41.928 --> 21:44.149
Don't worry about your shoes.
I've got your shoes. Come on.

21:47.461 --> 21:51.897
I... will... have... respect.

22:03.629 --> 22:04.895
Everyone, this way.

22:11.264 --> 22:14.096
See if there's any monks hiding
in these upper rooms.

22:14.811 --> 22:17.343
This way, go, go.

22:17.369 --> 22:19.402
Get a move on!

22:26.509 --> 22:28.643
Get every single one of
them into the chapel.

22:28.644 --> 22:30.344
Come on, move!

22:31.280 --> 22:33.012
- Where is Luc?
- I don't know.

22:33.744 --> 22:36.044
Take the children that way.

22:56.088 --> 22:57.853
Here. Stop.

22:59.131 --> 23:00.940
Adele, hide them behind the barrels.

23:00.966 --> 23:03.633
Take them all. Take them.

23:17.221 --> 23:19.376
This wasn't an ambush,
it was an execution.

23:21.973 --> 23:23.128
Sounds like trouble.

23:23.129 --> 23:25.329
Hyah, hyah!

23:33.061 --> 23:35.261
Get him!

23:50.516 --> 23:54.316
Where is he? Search the place. Find him!

23:55.640 --> 23:58.173
Get more men! Look in the cellars!

24:15.706 --> 24:17.840
Pierre, get back!

24:36.679 --> 24:37.756
Hey.

24:37.829 --> 24:38.862
Try this.

24:41.926 --> 24:44.558
- Not bad, eh?
- Good drop.

24:44.559 --> 24:46.626
Come on.

24:49.483 --> 24:52.860
The king has not attended the last
five council meetings.

24:53.792 --> 24:55.589
Nothing can be done
without his presence.

24:55.992 --> 24:59.003
I'm afraid the king's mind is
focused entirely on our son.

25:03.847 --> 25:08.592
Ahh! And how is my little man, today?

25:09.766 --> 25:11.953
- Have you defeated the Spanish?
- Yes.

25:12.310 --> 25:14.685
If only our own troops
could be as effective.

25:15.125 --> 25:17.854
Minister Treville had hoped
to speak with your majesty.

25:17.879 --> 25:20.223
Leave his majesty alone, Treville.

25:20.248 --> 25:23.481
Can't you see he has more
important business at hand?

25:23.505 --> 25:25.505
Ahh, chocolate.

25:26.897 --> 25:31.884
Clearly, I am expected. Mm.

25:36.715 --> 25:38.572
And what is the most important thing

25:38.643 --> 25:41.578
every good king must learn to
do as soon as he possibly may?

25:41.603 --> 25:43.356
- Ride.
- Yes.

25:43.382 --> 25:45.125
You are so very clever.

25:45.352 --> 25:47.150
I've got a surprise for you.

25:50.092 --> 25:51.939
- Isn't he a beauty?
- Yes.

25:51.965 --> 25:53.779
Your own little charger!

25:53.804 --> 25:56.826
Please, Louis, you can't
bring that animal in here.

25:56.851 --> 25:57.841
Nonsense!

25:57.866 --> 26:00.505
Felipe and I picked you
out the very best one.

26:02.851 --> 26:03.796
Oh, yes!

26:03.822 --> 26:06.139
You cannot distract the
king forever, Feron.

26:06.163 --> 26:09.203
Sooner or later, I will have my say.

26:09.229 --> 26:12.512
That is your problem Treville,
you never stop having your say.

26:13.890 --> 26:16.767
Is anyone really listening? Hmm?

26:24.455 --> 26:25.773
Help!

26:25.774 --> 26:28.106
Help us! Help!

26:28.107 --> 26:30.439
Wait there! Halt!

26:30.440 --> 26:32.106
Please, quickly.

26:32.107 --> 26:34.273
Help.

26:34.274 --> 26:36.707
Shh.

26:40.174 --> 26:44.040
The men who killed the soldiers
have taken the monastery.

26:45.936 --> 26:48.117
The abbott's dead.

26:48.118 --> 26:50.085
All right.

26:52.393 --> 26:53.777
Can you show us the way?

26:56.810 --> 26:58.405
Good boy.

26:58.406 --> 27:00.996
Shouldn't we report back
what we found here?

27:01.203 --> 27:05.550
- It's our duty as soldiers.
- We're also Musketeers.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.038
Who else knows about this way?

27:16.062 --> 27:17.814
Only the children and I.

27:31.662 --> 27:33.566
Next time I'm using the front door.

27:36.188 --> 27:38.196
The bell. Who rang the bell?

27:38.532 --> 27:41.465
The boy we saw on the road earlier.

27:41.491 --> 27:44.990
He got away. Should
have finished him then.

27:44.991 --> 27:47.090
Put men outside the walls.

27:47.091 --> 27:49.623
No one else escapes.

27:49.625 --> 27:51.304
Bring my horse around.

27:51.305 --> 27:55.039
I'll ride out to meet the
Spanish buyers at the border.

28:03.522 --> 28:05.315
Who's there?

28:08.455 --> 28:12.620
- Show yourself!
- Stop! Stop! Not him!

28:12.747 --> 28:16.080
- This is...
- Aramis. We know.

28:23.047 --> 28:25.347
This is not possible.

28:32.169 --> 28:35.536
You still have that knack of
getting into trouble, brother.

28:39.702 --> 28:40.883
Porthos.

28:42.873 --> 28:44.967
Your name's Porthos?

28:44.993 --> 28:47.725
- After the hero in the stories?
- Stories?

28:48.001 --> 28:50.233
I was named after my mother's father.

28:50.234 --> 28:52.947
- You were 'the' Porthos?
- The Porthos.

28:52.948 --> 28:54.680
This is the the Athos...

28:54.683 --> 28:58.083
and the... D'Artagnan.

28:59.743 --> 29:01.575
The stories were true?

29:01.576 --> 29:03.837
Our reputation precedes us.

29:04.981 --> 29:07.547
God moves in mysterious ways.

29:07.882 --> 29:09.001
Not that mysterious.

29:09.002 --> 29:10.389
We've been stationed in the valley below

29:10.390 --> 29:11.787
in a little thing called the war.

29:11.788 --> 29:14.487
We know all about the war here.

29:14.488 --> 29:16.457
Especially these little ones.

29:16.458 --> 29:18.958
Children, come out. Meet my friends.

29:24.825 --> 29:27.459
Now we just need to get them to safety.

29:33.359 --> 29:37.158
Now, look ahead, keep
looking ahead, that's it.

29:38.018 --> 29:41.938
The Dauphine grows older and the
king reverts to the nursery.

29:42.533 --> 29:45.712
I sometimes wonder which
Louis is the child.

29:45.713 --> 29:48.013
Oh, damnation.

29:51.077 --> 29:52.191
Can you help me?

29:52.192 --> 29:53.791
Here you are.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.125
- You all right?
- Thank you.

29:58.725 --> 30:02.057
I'm afraid...

30:02.058 --> 30:04.557
I have a touch of the family disease.

30:04.558 --> 30:08.899
My crumbling Bourbon spine.

30:08.900 --> 30:10.428
Thank you.

30:10.429 --> 30:12.928
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

30:14.171 --> 30:17.762
Louis was blessed to escape
your father's illness.

30:17.763 --> 30:20.148
Louis was always blessed.

30:20.149 --> 30:22.381
His mother was Marie de Medici.

30:22.382 --> 30:25.714
My mother was a chamber maid.

30:25.715 --> 30:27.548
Well, not exactly a chamber maid.

30:27.549 --> 30:29.548
Lady in waiting, but
you know what I mean.

30:29.549 --> 30:32.414
The question of your birth
never bothered the king.

30:32.810 --> 30:34.616
He has a generous spirit.

30:34.617 --> 30:38.117
More sober council has
advised him to disown you.

30:41.920 --> 30:44.269
But... he is very fond of you.

30:45.308 --> 30:50.103
You know, sometimes
you don't look Spanish at all.

30:51.129 --> 30:55.198
Sometimes you don't look like a bastard.

30:56.998 --> 30:59.665
We must really do this more often.

31:02.185 --> 31:04.249
Ahh, here's our little man.

31:04.274 --> 31:06.827
Come and give your poor
old Uncle Felipe a kiss.

31:10.504 --> 31:14.327
Where's papa? Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Oh, very well. Where are we going?

31:14.861 --> 31:16.861
Your majesty!

31:16.886 --> 31:18.886
Take your positions!

31:20.919 --> 31:21.936
Majesty!

31:21.961 --> 31:23.961
Louis?

31:23.986 --> 31:25.986
Majesty. Majesty.

31:26.432 --> 31:27.776
What's happening?

31:40.068 --> 31:41.559
You really frightened us.

31:45.240 --> 31:49.255
I've quite exhausted myself leading my
little soldier around on his charger.

31:50.529 --> 31:52.529
He is a... a natural.

31:53.433 --> 31:54.554
Born horseman.

31:55.586 --> 31:57.217
Carriage is remarkable.

31:57.218 --> 31:58.551
Papa.

31:58.576 --> 32:00.280
No more. No more.

32:00.531 --> 32:02.311
Felipe will play with you now.

32:02.460 --> 32:04.460
- Must I?
- Yes, you must.

32:06.955 --> 32:08.955
Very well, your majesty.

32:09.355 --> 32:11.355
Come on, you little... majesty.

32:20.835 --> 32:24.269
So, that's what happened
to our gun powder.

32:28.035 --> 32:29.501
Open the gate.

32:29.804 --> 32:31.969
That's the man I saw on the battlefield.

32:32.194 --> 32:34.488
We need to get everyone out of here.

32:35.047 --> 32:37.236
They might be going for reinforcements.

32:37.284 --> 32:39.627
Keep watch outside the wall.
Nobody leaves.

32:39.839 --> 32:41.572
We wait until dark.

32:41.761 --> 32:45.794
If we can keep the children hidden
until then, we stand a chance.

32:48.217 --> 32:50.217
D'Artagnan.

32:50.242 --> 32:52.242
Was Aramis really one of you?

32:52.267 --> 32:54.160
A Musketeer?

32:55.558 --> 32:57.558
He was the best shot in the army.

32:58.512 --> 33:00.972
One of the greatest
soldiers I've ever known.

33:12.530 --> 33:15.062
- Hello.
- Aramis!

33:15.902 --> 33:16.877
What is it?

33:20.923 --> 33:22.722
Well, let's ask him.

33:23.361 --> 33:26.127
She wants to know if you're a giant.

33:27.560 --> 33:32.853
I won't eat you because
I'm not hungry... yet.

33:33.977 --> 33:36.209
Hey!

33:37.443 --> 33:38.705
I think she likes you.

33:38.731 --> 33:40.795
She's got a funny way of showing it.

33:40.821 --> 33:42.966
It's good to see you again, my friend.

33:42.992 --> 33:46.126
It's been too long.
That wasn't my choice.

33:52.510 --> 33:55.043
I could not go to war with you, Porthos.

33:55.044 --> 33:58.143
We were comrades.

33:58.144 --> 34:01.925
I never had to worry what was behind me

34:01.926 --> 34:06.325
because you... you had my back.

34:06.326 --> 34:08.492
I made a promise to God...

34:08.722 --> 34:11.987
- a vow to myself.
- What about your vow to us?

34:12.440 --> 34:16.467
One for all. What about that?

34:16.960 --> 34:20.364
Four years is a long time.

34:20.366 --> 34:22.600
We learned to live without you.

34:36.659 --> 34:39.761
Constance, you asked for me?
What's the urgency?

34:40.992 --> 34:45.870
Well, I think you're
going to be needing this.

34:48.869 --> 34:50.969
What are you up to now?

34:56.616 --> 34:59.190
You have every right to
live any life you wish.

34:59.886 --> 35:00.939
We all do.

35:00.964 --> 35:02.964
It's for the right reasons.

35:04.145 --> 35:06.145
Adele.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.170
Isabella.

35:08.195 --> 35:09.428
Margaery.

35:09.429 --> 35:13.252
They are all dead, because they
made the mistake of loving me.

35:13.908 --> 35:18.084
Even the queen, I could not put her
and the Dauphine in danger again.

35:18.109 --> 35:22.302
And that's why I'm here. That's why
I made my promise to God.

35:22.960 --> 35:23.907
And now?

35:25.028 --> 35:27.253
The abbott, God rest his soul,

35:27.278 --> 35:31.042
he didn't think me ready to take my
orders, he even after all these years.

35:33.191 --> 35:37.016
I never had a problem with
poverty, even celibacy.

35:39.764 --> 35:41.764
It was obedience I could never take to.

35:44.065 --> 35:45.500
What about all that chanting?

35:47.550 --> 35:49.550
It's good to see you, my friend.

35:50.121 --> 35:52.370
Athos, it's getting dark.

35:52.395 --> 35:54.395
We need to start moving.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.420
Now.

35:58.951 --> 36:00.951
Give him time.

36:02.177 --> 36:05.276
Luc, children, we're leaving.

36:07.381 --> 36:08.707
I'll go through first.

36:08.708 --> 36:11.708
When I pull on the string,
send the first one through.

36:18.653 --> 36:20.753
Come on, look away.

36:23.299 --> 36:25.298
Now.

36:26.398 --> 36:28.930
Luc, you go first, help the
children to the other side.

36:30.178 --> 36:32.145
We're going one at a time.

36:37.389 --> 36:38.823
Are we friends now?

36:39.233 --> 36:41.067
Shh.

36:42.128 --> 36:43.664
Wait down there by that large tree.

36:43.689 --> 36:45.689
I'm sending the children to you.

36:50.748 --> 36:53.614
Marcheaux and the Red Guard
regularly use the old bath house.

36:53.861 --> 36:57.164
They can drink and gamble there
all night, amongst other things.

36:57.529 --> 37:00.395
- It has everything we need.
- Everything.

37:03.685 --> 37:07.925
Constance, I am a minister of the Crown.

37:07.926 --> 37:11.359
Well, for one night you
can be a Musketeer again.

37:11.385 --> 37:14.978
We're going to show Feron and his Red
Guards we're not to be humiliated.

37:28.954 --> 37:30.450
We're moving. Up. Up.

37:44.047 --> 37:46.414
This way.

37:59.775 --> 38:01.875
You're next.

38:03.989 --> 38:06.074
You will follow?

38:06.075 --> 38:07.896
We have matters to attend to here.

38:07.897 --> 38:10.361
The gunpowder must not fall
into the wrong hands.

38:10.362 --> 38:12.638
Head for the mountains.
We will find you.

38:15.755 --> 38:18.122
Your brothers are waiting.

38:31.885 --> 38:34.100
- The children?
- Bottom of the hill with Luc.

38:36.227 --> 38:38.227
- We'll leave at first light.
- You think?

38:38.579 --> 38:40.579
Good luck.

39:43.377 --> 39:46.176
Fire! Fire!

39:49.613 --> 39:51.415
Over here! This way!

39:51.416 --> 39:53.515
This way! Quickly, quickly!

40:08.434 --> 40:11.134
Not so cocky now, are we?

40:33.158 --> 40:34.063
Minister Treville.

40:35.623 --> 40:36.724
What's this about?

40:36.750 --> 40:40.450
Captain, in the future, pick
on somebody your own size.

40:45.126 --> 40:47.288
Children, stay in line.

40:47.288 --> 40:49.354
The path gets difficult here.

40:50.398 --> 40:52.687
Why didn't you tell me the
stories you told us were true?

40:52.688 --> 40:55.987
And you were one of them, a Musketeer!

40:55.988 --> 40:58.920
I renounced that life
when I joined the monastery.

40:58.921 --> 41:01.254
And now?

41:01.255 --> 41:04.654
Pierre, don't throw things.
Keep them quiet.

41:04.655 --> 41:06.955
Don't do that.

41:27.038 --> 41:29.038
They've escaped!

41:31.010 --> 41:33.642
They can't have gone far.

41:33.668 --> 41:35.280
Get the horses on the wagon.

41:35.306 --> 41:37.740
The Spanish buyers are on their way.

41:41.772 --> 41:43.039
Clean yourself up.

41:50.167 --> 41:52.874
Treville is a disgrace to France.

41:52.900 --> 41:56.415
What kind of soldier would put that
woman in charge of the garrison mess?

41:56.416 --> 41:58.114
Perhaps he is warming her bed

41:58.400 --> 42:01.166
while her idiot husband is away at war.

42:01.227 --> 42:04.459
There is something unnatural
about that bitch.

42:04.460 --> 42:07.760
She has the cunning of the devil.

42:08.790 --> 42:10.056
Come here.

42:10.082 --> 42:11.174
And yet...

42:13.260 --> 42:17.496
you have let her turn the Red Guard...

42:17.697 --> 42:19.925
into a laughing stock.

42:20.570 --> 42:23.303
That undermines my authority, George.

42:23.340 --> 42:25.173
It cannot happen again.

42:27.223 --> 42:29.223
Don't touch me.

42:39.937 --> 42:40.929
Look at us.

42:42.495 --> 42:44.495
We are quite a pair.

42:45.798 --> 42:47.798
Fit only for the infirmary.

42:59.060 --> 43:01.821
Aramis! The bandits! They're here!

43:01.991 --> 43:03.714
Move, move. Quickly, move! Keep moving,

43:03.740 --> 43:06.130
keep moving, keep moving. Don't stop.

43:14.422 --> 43:16.437
Luc, Luc, hide the children in there.

43:18.908 --> 43:21.010
Brothers, hide yourself. Keep moving.

43:21.610 --> 43:23.475
Wherever you can. Quickly, go on.

43:23.890 --> 43:24.935
Go, go, spread out.

43:25.513 --> 43:28.021
You did very well. Now,
shh, stay quiet, okay?

43:28.352 --> 43:29.820
Go in there. Hide in there.

43:33.750 --> 43:35.135
Stay with the children.

43:35.942 --> 43:37.164
You're their protector now.

43:37.915 --> 43:39.815
What are you going to do?

44:05.229 --> 44:06.450
Come here!

44:06.494 --> 44:08.261
Get away from the children!

44:25.313 --> 44:27.978
Get off me! Get off me! Aramis!

44:30.070 --> 44:31.904
Stay away from her!

44:46.728 --> 44:48.991
Don't move.

44:48.991 --> 44:50.492
I'll kill him.

44:50.493 --> 44:53.274
So, the man of God was once a soldier.

44:54.599 --> 44:56.756
You've been wearing a cassock too long.

45:04.549 --> 45:06.144
Luc!

45:06.145 --> 45:08.979
You really are a Musketeer.

45:17.814 --> 45:19.559
A bit rusty right now.

45:19.585 --> 45:21.718
I'm not so sure I want to be
a soldier anymore.

45:30.406 --> 45:31.748
Let's get the children.

45:41.774 --> 45:42.555
Luc.

45:49.024 --> 45:51.523
Spanish soldiers. I need
to warn the others.

45:52.360 --> 45:53.548
Just stay hidden.

45:54.649 --> 45:55.573
You'll be safe.

46:07.848 --> 46:10.748
Open the gates! The Spanish are here!

46:18.288 --> 46:20.421
Musketeers!

46:53.518 --> 46:56.318
Porthos, stop him! Take the wagon!

47:29.582 --> 47:30.881
Spanish soldiers.

47:30.883 --> 47:33.547
They cannot be allowed
to get that gun powder.

47:37.842 --> 47:39.775
Whoa!

47:49.162 --> 47:50.352
Which way we going?

47:53.867 --> 47:54.549
Hyah!

48:50.210 --> 48:52.268
Do you need help with that?

48:52.269 --> 48:53.687
Just shoot straight.

49:19.917 --> 49:21.917
Aramis, get out of there!

49:23.073 --> 49:25.340
It's about to get hot!

49:39.633 --> 49:42.800
Are you going to try and tell
me that you didn't enjoy that?

49:53.972 --> 49:55.080
Vamonos!

50:23.858 --> 50:26.425
Thank you for all you've done.

50:39.166 --> 50:41.799
You be good now, all right?

50:46.738 --> 50:48.971
Look after the brothers.

50:49.059 --> 50:51.259
Yes, I will.

50:54.776 --> 50:58.543
So, you think we'll need
three or four horses?

51:04.886 --> 51:06.655
I thought I understood your plan.

51:06.916 --> 51:11.683
Now you... seem to be
showing me another path.

51:14.154 --> 51:17.386
In the middle of all the danger
and excitement today,

51:17.387 --> 51:21.020
you were closer to me than at
any time in all my years here.

51:21.021 --> 51:26.186
I've never felt so... alive.

51:27.186 --> 51:28.740
This is what you made me.

51:32.387 --> 51:34.353
A Musketeer.

51:42.208 --> 51:44.518
You are many things, Aramis...

51:44.519 --> 51:47.319
but a monk is not one of them.

51:50.552 --> 51:53.185
You can't argue with God.

52:13.152 --> 52:14.384
Lucien.

52:15.720 --> 52:17.761
I have what you want.

52:18.335 --> 52:20.298
Where have you been? I needed you.

52:21.356 --> 52:22.406
Calm yourself.

52:23.019 --> 52:26.286
Our plans were ruined
by interfering Musketeers.

52:28.270 --> 52:30.803
Careful! Careful!

52:33.678 --> 52:36.445
Drink it down and it'll all be better.

53:03.315 --> 53:05.922
I can't live with the pain.

53:07.919 --> 53:10.186
Let the medicine work.

53:21.090 --> 53:22.855
There.

53:23.581 --> 53:25.581
Better now?

53:27.796 --> 53:30.462
You can never leave me again.

53:35.293 --> 53:38.027
I have everything I need in Paris.

54:16.376 --> 54:17.606
Perfectly acceptable.

54:32.329 --> 54:33.182
Hyah!

54:34.507 --> 54:35.527
Hyah!

54:47.510 --> 54:48.465
Hyah!

54:54.748 --> 54:56.409
I need these ordinances sent over

54:56.410 --> 54:59.242
to the military supply depot
at Bagneux immediately.

54:59.244 --> 55:01.343
I'll need a fresh horse.

55:02.589 --> 55:04.205
It was a very long ride.

55:04.728 --> 55:06.388
Athos.

55:06.791 --> 55:09.078
I had no idea. You
should have sent word.

55:11.778 --> 55:13.590
Porthos. Minister.

55:15.844 --> 55:18.946
Aramis. You came back to us.

55:21.768 --> 55:23.812
It seems I never really went away.

55:26.939 --> 55:29.640
D'Artagnan? He's not...?

55:31.039 --> 55:33.130
No, he, uh, had some important business

55:33.156 --> 55:34.985
to attend to at the garrison.

55:37.800 --> 55:39.800
What have I told you about running?

55:39.825 --> 55:41.341
Sorry, Madam D'Artagnan.

56:18.622 --> 56:19.559
Did you miss me?

56:48.550 --> 56:48.978
Who's that?

56:49.790 --> 56:51.177
The Marquis de Feron.

56:51.305 --> 56:54.937
Governor of Paris,
Commander of the Red Guard.

56:54.963 --> 56:56.391
Ah, Treville.

56:58.263 --> 57:02.641
I see you have found some
grown-up Musketeers at last.

57:03.502 --> 57:08.368
Governor, you haven't met Porthos...

57:08.369 --> 57:12.743
Athos, Aramis.

57:12.744 --> 57:16.446
Ah, the war heroes.

57:16.447 --> 57:19.747
Not quite as impressive in the flesh.

57:22.580 --> 57:26.064
But then, legends tend to exaggerate
everything, even courage.

57:26.065 --> 57:27.896
You will be seeing a great deal more

57:27.897 --> 57:30.530
of the captain and his men, Feron.

57:30.531 --> 57:32.642
They are to be stationed here in Paris.

57:32.643 --> 57:34.674
Effective immediately.

57:34.675 --> 57:37.674
Not returning to the front?

57:39.183 --> 57:41.141
Perhaps it's for the best.

57:41.142 --> 57:44.441
We need men in their prime
fighting for France,

57:45.045 --> 57:47.043
not worn-out dregs.

57:48.663 --> 57:51.853
The world has changed
since you've been away.

57:51.854 --> 57:54.639
Paris is my city now.

57:55.726 --> 57:59.226
Cross me and you'll live to regret it.
