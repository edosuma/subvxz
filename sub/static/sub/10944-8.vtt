00:01.158 --> 00:02.859
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:02.893 --> 00:05.095
I'm thinking I should
really stick with Hubbard,

00:05.379 --> 00:07.914
and I think you should too.

00:07.948 --> 00:09.915
Not gonna happen.

00:09.949 --> 00:11.283
I already quit.

00:11.317 --> 00:13.051
Ty:
But you gotta make a choice,

00:13.086 --> 00:14.152
him or me.

00:15.221 --> 00:16.721
Are you back with him?

00:16.756 --> 00:18.390
He's exactly the same,

00:18.424 --> 00:20.625
and you and me,
we are exactly the same.

00:20.659 --> 00:22.294
We keep having
this conversation

00:22.328 --> 00:24.462
over and over again.

00:25.398 --> 00:27.565
Tim: You hated every minute
of that trip to France.

00:27.600 --> 00:31.836
I went on the trip, Lise.
What else do you want from me?!

00:31.871 --> 00:34.672
<i>Lisa:</i>
<i>You're here and I'm there.</i>

00:34.707 --> 00:36.708
We should take a break.

00:39.812 --> 00:42.113
(Horses whinny,
tack jingles)

00:42.147 --> 00:43.480
(Wagon rattles)

00:47.351 --> 00:48.285
Yah!
(Horses whinny)

00:48.319 --> 00:49.486
<i>Ha! Come on!</i>

00:49.521 --> 00:51.288
<i>Hup, hup! Come on!</i>

00:51.322 --> 00:52.956
Hup! Come on!

00:52.990 --> 00:54.357
Hup!
(Horses whinny)

00:55.293 --> 00:56.460
Come on!

00:57.361 --> 00:59.929
(Hooves thunder,
wagon clatters and clangs)

01:01.331 --> 01:03.165
Come on! Hup! Come on!

01:04.266 --> 01:05.468
Hup! Let's go! Hup!

01:05.501 --> 01:06.469
Yah!

01:06.503 --> 01:08.003
Hiyah!

01:09.306 --> 01:12.374
(Wagon barrels along,
horses whinny)

01:13.777 --> 01:15.243
(Dirt sprays)

01:15.277 --> 01:16.845
Come on! Hup! Hup!

01:18.147 --> 01:19.314
Come on! Hup!

01:20.282 --> 01:22.150
Yah!

01:22.217 --> 01:23.251
(Clapping)

01:23.719 --> 01:25.687
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa...</i>

01:28.658 --> 01:30.325
Amy: You know, when you
said chuck wagon horses

01:30.392 --> 01:31.325
on the phone,

01:31.392 --> 01:32.760
I was thinking bigger horses.

01:32.794 --> 01:33.861
Man: Yeah, well, the regular
chucks are all right,

01:33.895 --> 01:35.663
but this is a lot more fun
if you ask me.

01:35.730 --> 01:37.397
Well, yeah,
they sure were fast.

01:37.432 --> 01:40.568
Yup. What they lack in size
they make up for in speed.

01:40.602 --> 01:42.169
This here's
my four best horses,

01:42.236 --> 01:45.906
but I got another team
that isn't performing so well.

01:45.974 --> 01:48.875
You see,
I got one big problem.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.409
Well...

01:50.444 --> 01:53.179
More like
one miniature problem.

01:54.682 --> 01:55.849
That's Bug.

01:55.916 --> 01:56.983
He's a nice looking horse,

01:57.017 --> 01:59.719
but he's throwing off
the entire team.

01:59.787 --> 02:00.720
Amy: Well, have you tried
ground driving him

02:00.788 --> 02:01.788
with the lead horse?

02:01.856 --> 02:02.955
Man:
Yeah, I've tried everything.

02:02.989 --> 02:04.656
Nothing seems to make
any difference.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.959
Bug was sired by
one of my fastest horses,

02:07.026 --> 02:08.526
so I know he's made
of the right stuff.

02:08.595 --> 02:10.496
<i>He's just not reaching</i>
<i>his potential.</i>

02:10.562 --> 02:12.163
He's a pretty friendly
little guy.

02:12.231 --> 02:13.832
Yeah,
you got that right.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.702
Follows people around
like a puppy dog.

02:16.769 --> 02:19.670
But I got no use
for a pet.

02:19.738 --> 02:22.339
I need you to transform Bug
into a winner.

02:22.407 --> 02:23.508
You think you're up
to that?

02:23.575 --> 02:24.909
Yeah. I'll give it
a shot.

02:24.977 --> 02:26.043
(Phone rings)

02:28.380 --> 02:29.881
Excuse me,
I have to take this.

02:32.183 --> 02:34.851
Lily, hi.
What's going on?

02:35.786 --> 02:37.921
Man: You're doing a good
job there, sweetie.

02:37.989 --> 02:39.523
I'm not getting
involved, Amy.

02:39.590 --> 02:40.590
Come on, Ty,

02:40.658 --> 02:41.825
your mom sounded
really worried.

02:41.893 --> 02:43.026
I think you should
at least go talk to him,

02:43.060 --> 02:44.027
and I'll go with you.

02:44.061 --> 02:45.862
No. No way.

02:45.930 --> 02:48.131
If I go,
and that's a big if,

02:48.165 --> 02:50.066
I'm going alone.

02:51.234 --> 02:53.201
Lou: So Ty's starting
vet school soon

02:53.236 --> 02:54.336
and I promised Amy

02:54.370 --> 02:55.871
I would throw him
this dinner party,

02:55.906 --> 02:57.540
so I'm gonna need you
to go to the grocery store

02:57.574 --> 02:59.642
so I can finally get some work
done around here.

02:59.676 --> 03:01.309
Sure.
I can do that.

03:01.344 --> 03:03.278
Thank you, Mallory.
You are a life saver.

03:03.312 --> 03:05.781
But I can do
so much more than that.

03:05.849 --> 03:07.615
Why don't you let me
organize Ty's dinner?

03:07.650 --> 03:08.883
That way you can concentrate
on your work,

03:08.951 --> 03:10.785
and I can concentrate
on creating

03:10.819 --> 03:12.153
dinner party magic.

03:12.187 --> 03:13.688
I don't know, Mallory.
It's a lot of responsibility.

03:13.722 --> 03:15.723
I am fully capable of
putting up some decorations

03:15.758 --> 03:17.291
and putting a roast
in the oven.

03:17.325 --> 03:18.893
Plus, Katie's gonna be
at her grandparents,

03:18.928 --> 03:20.862
<i>so I don't have to worry</i>
<i>about babysitting.</i>

03:20.896 --> 03:22.363
I can totally do this.

03:23.297 --> 03:24.631
All right.

03:24.666 --> 03:26.567
But I can't risk anything
going wrong,

03:26.601 --> 03:28.902
so... first things first.

03:28.937 --> 03:30.871
We need to be in
constant communication.

03:30.905 --> 03:32.405
From now on,
you're gonna sleep

03:32.440 --> 03:34.541
and you eat
wearing this earpiece.

03:34.576 --> 03:35.876
- Got it?
- Got it.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.678
And you're gonna need
to find an assistant

03:37.712 --> 03:40.345
because being in charge
is all about delegating.

03:40.380 --> 03:41.647
Who do I delegate to?

03:41.682 --> 03:42.982
<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>I am so hungry.</i>

03:43.016 --> 03:44.216
Normally, I'd say I could eat
a horse,

03:44.250 --> 03:46.786
but I can't say that anymore.

03:46.820 --> 03:49.254
Georgie,
clear your schedule!

03:49.289 --> 03:50.355
Huh?

03:51.458 --> 03:53.025

Agh!

Wade:
Well, you're water pump's shot

05:26.681 --> 05:28.682
and the generator's
not looking too good.

05:28.749 --> 05:31.283
Neither is the carburetor.

05:31.350 --> 05:33.618
It'll be tough finding
parts for a '57.

05:33.687 --> 05:35.420
Yeah, I can get 'em
online.

05:35.488 --> 05:37.222
That's gonna be pricy.

05:37.290 --> 05:38.290
Luckily for you,

05:38.324 --> 05:40.025
I've got a friend
who can help out,

05:40.060 --> 05:41.226
free.

05:41.260 --> 05:42.194
No, I bet you do.

05:42.261 --> 05:43.628
Nah, Ty,
it's not like that.

05:43.663 --> 05:45.197
This is a legit friend.

05:45.264 --> 05:47.298
Oh, I bet he is.

05:47.365 --> 05:50.334
Hey, man, you don't want
my help, that's fine.

05:50.368 --> 05:53.204
Why don't you tell me
what you're doing up here.

05:53.238 --> 05:55.206
- My mom called.
- Oh yeah?

05:56.141 --> 05:58.176
Checking up on me?

05:58.243 --> 05:59.977
(Laughs)

06:00.012 --> 06:03.880
I gotta tell you,
I find that so satisfying

06:04.849 --> 06:07.584
knowing she's out there
twitching,

06:07.618 --> 06:09.152
especially after
she broke things off with me

06:09.187 --> 06:10.954
with no explanation.

06:10.988 --> 06:13.523
She's worried about you.

06:13.591 --> 06:15.192
Well, you can report
back to her

06:15.226 --> 06:18.228
that I've never
been happier.

06:19.930 --> 06:21.030
My boss has got me working
out here

06:21.064 --> 06:23.699
for a few days,
so...

06:23.734 --> 06:24.700
You change your mind
about those parts,

06:24.735 --> 06:27.803
you know where
to find me.

06:33.910 --> 06:35.877
Lou: No, no, no.
Mallory, you have to go today.

06:35.945 --> 06:38.279
Yeah,
before the bakery closes.

06:38.347 --> 06:39.614
Okay. Yes. Bye.

06:40.549 --> 06:42.516
So are you gonna talk
on the phone all day,

06:42.551 --> 06:43.785
or are you gonna
talk to me.

06:43.819 --> 06:45.153
I'm sorry,
but I did tell you

06:45.187 --> 06:46.520
this would be
a working lunch.

06:46.555 --> 06:49.290
I have a lot going on
today.

06:49.324 --> 06:50.625
(Groans)

06:50.959 --> 06:52.392
- What?
- Jerk alert.

06:53.294 --> 06:55.763
Man: Well, look who it is.
Tim Fleming.

06:55.797 --> 06:57.231
Oh! Hi, Dan.

06:57.265 --> 06:58.632
<i>I haven't seen you</i>
<i>for awhile.</i>

06:58.666 --> 06:59.867
You remember my daughter,
Lou.

06:59.901 --> 07:01.802
Lou: Hi, Dan.
Dan: Hi, Lou.

07:01.836 --> 07:02.936
You know, I haven't seen
your father

07:02.971 --> 07:05.072
around the track lately.

07:05.106 --> 07:08.040
I guess he never did manage
to come up with a winning horse.

07:08.075 --> 07:09.675
Well, I'm not in the race
business any more, Dan.

07:09.709 --> 07:11.277
I decided to follow
the money

07:11.311 --> 07:12.678
back to my herd
of cattle.

07:12.712 --> 07:14.947
Never should've left them
in the first place.

07:14.982 --> 07:16.415
Well, I could've
told you that, Tim.

07:16.449 --> 07:17.683
I mean,
this racehorse business,

07:17.717 --> 07:19.585
<i>it's not for</i>
<i>the faint of heart...</i>

07:19.619 --> 07:21.120
Or the faint of wallet.

07:21.155 --> 07:22.588
(Laughing)

07:22.655 --> 07:24.054
Am I right?

07:24.055 --> 07:25.890
(Phone rings)
Excuse me.

07:26.325 --> 07:28.226
Can you believe
that guy?

07:28.261 --> 07:31.062
You know, Dan is
the one man in Hudson

07:31.097 --> 07:33.498
who has more money
than Lanny Barrick.

07:33.532 --> 07:34.732
If he wasn't Lisa's
ex-husband,

07:34.767 --> 07:37.368
I would totally go after
his business.

07:37.403 --> 07:39.804
You land a big fish
like Dan,

07:39.871 --> 07:42.439
Lanny Barrick and his buddies
will follow right in suit.

07:42.507 --> 07:43.974
I know.

07:44.042 --> 07:45.475
But I could never
do that to Grandpa.

07:45.510 --> 07:46.977
I mean,
he can't stand the guy.

07:47.012 --> 07:48.412
I've never met someone
I disliked so much

07:48.446 --> 07:51.181
I couldn't take
their money.

07:51.248 --> 07:53.350
No, no. You know what?
It's a bad idea

07:53.418 --> 07:55.352
and I am just gonna
forget about it.

07:55.386 --> 07:58.254
You're right,
that sounds like you.

07:58.289 --> 08:00.490
I swear, I will never say
the name Dan Hartfield

08:00.558 --> 08:01.925
ever again.

08:03.828 --> 08:04.993
Dan Hartfield.

08:05.028 --> 08:05.994
For what?

08:06.062 --> 08:07.330
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>It's just an idea,</i>

08:07.364 --> 08:08.731
and I wouldn't even think
of pursuing him as a client

08:08.799 --> 08:10.399
without your blessing.

08:10.467 --> 08:12.802
And why would you need me
to bless that?

08:12.869 --> 08:14.770
Because he's Lisa's
ex-husband,

08:14.838 --> 08:15.771
and I know there's
a lot of water

08:15.806 --> 08:17.707
under that bridge,
so...

08:19.643 --> 08:21.743
You do what you want,
Lou.

08:21.811 --> 08:23.311
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Really?</i>

08:23.379 --> 08:25.279
That guy means nothing
to me.

08:25.348 --> 08:27.148
<i>Never did.</i>

08:27.216 --> 08:28.950
So you go to town
on him.

08:29.017 --> 08:30.051
Thank you.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.356
Ty:
I can't believe this.

08:34.390 --> 08:36.256
I spent the last of my savings
getting the truck towed.

08:36.325 --> 08:38.924
Now, how am I gonna
get it fixed?

08:38.993 --> 08:40.828
Amy:
Sorry about your truck.

08:40.861 --> 08:41.895
Ty:
(Sighs)

08:42.929 --> 08:45.198
Hey, um...
What happened with Wade?

08:46.167 --> 08:48.201
Did you end up
seeing him?

08:48.269 --> 08:49.503
Yeah.

08:49.537 --> 08:51.438
And?

08:51.506 --> 08:53.573
And nothing.
He's fine.

08:54.508 --> 08:55.641
I already called my mom

08:55.676 --> 08:57.209
and told her there's nothing
to worry about.

08:57.244 --> 08:58.978
I just wish that she didn't
get you involved in that.

08:59.045 --> 09:00.513
I don't mind.

09:00.547 --> 09:03.182
She's your mom.
I care about her too.

09:03.216 --> 09:04.717
Well, one thing's for sure,
I'm gonna sleep better

09:04.785 --> 09:07.520
knowing that he's not
in her life anymore.

09:07.554 --> 09:09.187
Oh! Lou wanted me
to tell you

09:09.221 --> 09:11.790
don't forget about
the big dinner she's planning.

09:11.824 --> 09:13.091
What's the occasion?

09:13.158 --> 09:15.026
- You.
- Me?

09:15.995 --> 09:18.329
Amy, you know I don't like
those things.

09:18.364 --> 09:19.998
Come on.
Vet school,

09:20.032 --> 09:22.100
you're starting
in a few weeks...

09:22.134 --> 09:24.435
It's time to celebrate,
you know?

09:24.503 --> 09:26.336
I haven't graduated,
Amy.

09:26.371 --> 09:28.773
I still have four years,
and that's if I pass.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.475
It's just dinner,
right?

09:31.510 --> 09:33.310
Come on, now.

09:33.344 --> 09:35.078
You worry too much.

09:35.113 --> 09:36.213
See ya!

09:38.216 --> 09:39.550
(Sighs heavily)

09:43.320 --> 09:44.487
Stupid truck.

09:44.522 --> 09:45.588
Mallory:
Don't worry, Lou,

09:45.623 --> 09:46.790
I picked up everything
on the list.

09:46.857 --> 09:49.559
I'm carrying in the groceries
as we speak.

09:49.593 --> 09:51.961
Everything is
right on schedule.

09:51.995 --> 09:53.897
No, you're amazing!

09:53.931 --> 09:55.064
Okay. Bye.

09:55.999 --> 09:58.266
"No, you're amazing!"

09:58.301 --> 10:00.436
Not now, Georgie.
I'm concentrating.

10:00.470 --> 10:01.837
It's my responsibility

10:01.871 --> 10:04.673
to execute Lou's vision
for this dinner, perfectly.

10:04.707 --> 10:07.476
And how important
to Lou's vision is the cake?

10:07.544 --> 10:09.110
Because we never did stop
at the bakery.

10:09.145 --> 10:10.479
(Gasps)
Oh! I forgot!

10:10.513 --> 10:12.513
And it closes
in half an hour!

10:15.684 --> 10:16.751
(Keys jingle)

10:21.457 --> 10:22.957
(Lift whirs)

10:29.730 --> 10:30.797
(Lift halts)

10:34.769 --> 10:35.936
What?

10:35.970 --> 10:38.071
Did I say we were
taking a break?

10:38.105 --> 10:40.306
I don't recall
you being the boss.

10:40.341 --> 10:41.741
Fine.

10:41.776 --> 10:43.009
(Hay bale crashes)

10:44.178 --> 10:46.579
It's your hay.
You haul it.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.514
Oh, somebody got up on
the wrong side of the bed.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.415
I was just fine
until I saw you.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.551
It's like watching a cow
chewing her cud.

10:52.586 --> 10:53.752
You're all riled up

10:53.787 --> 10:55.220
'cause Lou's gone into
business with Dan.

10:55.254 --> 10:56.522
Dan who?

10:56.556 --> 10:58.390
You know damn well
who I'm talking about, Jack.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.459
Why don't you go back
to chewing

11:00.493 --> 11:01.759
and leave me alone.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.796
No. Why don't we have
this out right now?

11:04.830 --> 11:06.965
'Cause I'm tired
of your mood swings.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.801
You're either going through
some kind of male menopause,

11:09.835 --> 11:12.003
or something happened
with Lisa.

11:12.037 --> 11:13.605
You oughta mind
your own business.

11:13.672 --> 11:14.873
No. Come on!

11:14.907 --> 11:15.707
You gotta talk to somebody
about this, Jack.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.107
It might as well be me.

11:17.174 --> 11:18.609
You're the last person
on this planet

11:18.676 --> 11:20.343
that I would confide in.

11:20.411 --> 11:21.778
- That hurts me.
- Good!

11:21.846 --> 11:23.380
'Cause it was your advice
that got me into this mess

11:23.447 --> 11:24.548
in the first place.

11:24.582 --> 11:25.883
- What do you mean?
- I was gonna tel  Lisa

11:25.950 --> 11:28.151
how I really felt
about being in France,

11:28.219 --> 11:30.554
but you said,
"No. Don't rock the boat."

11:30.622 --> 11:31.555
I said that?

11:31.623 --> 11:33.355
So I didn't,
which was stupid

11:33.423 --> 11:34.624
'cause we had one hell
of a fight

11:34.691 --> 11:36.058
and now she's gone.

11:36.126 --> 11:38.427
She left me.
Are you happy?

11:38.461 --> 11:40.930
No! No.

11:42.065 --> 11:43.365
I'm sorry.

11:44.735 --> 11:48.770
You took my advice?
With my track record?!

11:49.772 --> 11:50.972
Shut up.

11:55.578 --> 11:58.780
Oh! Look at these guys.
They're so cool!

11:58.848 --> 12:00.114
Can I ride one tomorrow?

12:00.182 --> 12:01.883
(Laughing)
No, you can't ride one!

12:01.951 --> 12:04.552
Bug here has some issues
that I'm working on.

12:05.119 --> 12:06.386
Why? What's wrong
with him?

12:06.421 --> 12:09.122
Well, you see,
he refuses to cooperate

12:09.190 --> 12:10.624
with Spike here,
the lead horse,

12:10.692 --> 12:12.726
and I've been
ground driving them all day,

12:12.794 --> 12:14.127
and it just doesn't work.

12:14.195 --> 12:15.829
He's not listening.

12:15.897 --> 12:17.531
Maybe it's like
herding cattle.

12:17.599 --> 12:18.699
You just need patience,

12:18.767 --> 12:20.000
knowledge of
the flight zone

12:20.035 --> 12:21.734
and a bit of
bovine psychology.

12:21.769 --> 12:23.870
Yeah, I don't know
if that applies to horses.

12:23.904 --> 12:25.538
But, since you're so eager
to help,

12:25.573 --> 12:26.906
why don't you give me a hand
taking this off

12:26.974 --> 12:28.240
and we'll put them away.

12:28.275 --> 12:29.542
Gladly!

12:29.577 --> 12:31.110
Especially if it means
I can get away from Mallory.

12:31.144 --> 12:32.979
She's driving me nuts!

12:33.013 --> 12:34.513
Amy: I'm sure she is. (Laughs)

12:36.349 --> 12:37.415
All right...

12:38.685 --> 12:40.418
(Motorcycle rumbles)

12:43.255 --> 12:45.490
Wade:
Oh! Look who's here.

12:48.294 --> 12:51.630
What's the matter, Ty?
You missed me already?

12:51.664 --> 12:53.864
I wouldn't be here
if I had any other option.

12:53.899 --> 12:55.666
What can I do
for you?

12:55.701 --> 12:56.667
I need the name
of your friend

12:56.702 --> 12:58.268
who collects
the old trucks.

12:58.303 --> 12:59.704
I can't get the parts
online.

12:59.738 --> 13:00.838
You know, usually,

13:00.872 --> 13:02.073
when somebody asks me
for a favour,

13:02.107 --> 13:03.808
they say "please."

13:05.677 --> 13:06.911
Since you asked me
so nicely,

13:06.945 --> 13:09.546
I'll see what I can do
for you.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.014
All I need is a number,
Wade.

13:11.048 --> 13:12.082
You know,
my buddy Darrell,

13:12.117 --> 13:13.783
he's a little
on the eccentric side.

13:13.818 --> 13:16.920
Probably better
if I do the talking.

13:16.954 --> 13:18.589
You know what?
Forget it.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.357
Hey, come on.

13:20.391 --> 13:21.858
You want the parts
or not?

13:35.872 --> 13:38.007
Georgie:
"Happy retirement Larry."

13:38.041 --> 13:39.375
Who's Larry?

13:39.409 --> 13:40.743
Mallory:
Stay outta there!

13:40.777 --> 13:42.410
Chill!
I was just looking.

13:42.445 --> 13:44.179
I barely made it to the bakery
on time yesterday.

13:44.213 --> 13:45.213
They were just locking
the door

13:45.248 --> 13:46.348
as I arrived.

13:46.382 --> 13:47.782
I had to practically
beg them

13:47.816 --> 13:49.717
to give me the cake
that Lou special ordered.

13:49.752 --> 13:52.020
She would've freaked if I messed this up.
Actually...

13:52.054 --> 13:53.221
And I noticed you haven't done
the vacuuming

13:53.256 --> 13:54.222
in the living room yet.

13:54.290 --> 13:55.423
I have to tell you
something.

13:55.458 --> 13:57.258
Less talking,
more vacuuming.

13:57.325 --> 13:58.325
And after that,

13:58.360 --> 13:59.426
I need you to unload
the dishwasher,

13:59.461 --> 14:01.462
set the table,
put up the decorations,

14:01.496 --> 14:03.397
and pick wild flowers
for the centre piece.

14:03.431 --> 14:04.465
Okay?

14:04.533 --> 14:06.233
It sounds like
a lot of work,

14:06.268 --> 14:07.568
but it'll all be worth it

14:07.636 --> 14:10.003
when I see everyone's face
when you serve dessert.

14:12.607 --> 14:13.573
Good!

14:13.641 --> 14:15.642
(Hooves thunder,
horses whinny)

14:18.078 --> 14:21.247
Well, this uh...
Certainly is rustic.

14:22.183 --> 14:23.583
My company may be small,

14:23.617 --> 14:25.351
but I can assure you
that you'll have access

14:25.386 --> 14:26.852
to the same
financial products

14:26.920 --> 14:28.254
as you would
with a larger firm...

14:28.322 --> 14:29.488
I know, I know.

14:29.556 --> 14:31.390
With the added bonus
of a competitive fee base-

14:31.457 --> 14:32.857
Lou!

14:32.925 --> 14:35.394
You can stop there.

14:35.428 --> 14:37.629
Lisa cannot say enough
good things

14:37.697 --> 14:39.164
about your financial skills,

14:39.232 --> 14:40.765
and believe me,

14:40.833 --> 14:44.203
I know how hard she is
to impress.

14:44.270 --> 14:47.305
So... I'm willing
to give you

14:47.372 --> 14:49.540
ten percent
of my portfolio.

14:49.608 --> 14:51.176
Really?

14:51.243 --> 14:52.877
You make me
some real money,

14:52.945 --> 14:54.512
and we'll talk more
later.

14:54.580 --> 14:55.613
Thank you, Dan.

14:55.647 --> 14:58.482
This is an amazing opportunity
and...

14:58.517 --> 14:59.550
And I won't let you down.

14:59.618 --> 15:01.086
Okay.

15:01.153 --> 15:02.652
I'll have my accountant
send over

15:02.721 --> 15:04.688
the necessary information.

15:04.756 --> 15:06.090
Oh, and you should know

15:06.157 --> 15:09.526
that Lisa and I will be keeping
our finances separate...

15:09.594 --> 15:10.627
At least for now.

15:10.695 --> 15:12.730
Mm-hmm.
Um, isn't that a given

15:12.797 --> 15:14.765
considering
you guys are divorced?

15:14.833 --> 15:18.234
Yes, but now that
we've reconciled,

15:19.169 --> 15:22.171
um, you know, we may be
pooling our resources.

15:22.239 --> 15:23.806
Uh-huh.

15:23.841 --> 15:25.808
- I'll see you.
- Okay.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.613
(Car rumbles to a stop)

15:32.649 --> 15:34.149
What're you doing here?

15:34.217 --> 15:35.350
Oh, come on now,

15:35.417 --> 15:36.384
is that any way
to greet the man

15:36.452 --> 15:38.453
who just solved
all your problems?

15:40.656 --> 15:41.757
You got the parts?

15:41.791 --> 15:43.424
Wade:
Yeah, I got the parts.

15:43.459 --> 15:46.694
Well, sort of.
We gotta go pick 'em up.

15:46.763 --> 15:48.630
Come on, let's go.
Climb in.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.164
<i>What're you waiting for?</i>

15:50.198 --> 15:52.633
Just give me the address, Wade.
I'll get the parts on my own.

15:52.667 --> 15:54.101
Oh no, man,
you'll never find it.

15:54.169 --> 15:57.204
It's way out
in the middle of nowhere.

15:57.239 --> 16:00.040
Come on! Let's get in.
Tick tock.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.378
All right,
forget about it.

16:04.412 --> 16:06.246
Ty:
Hold on, hold on.

16:07.181 --> 16:09.282
Wade:
Now you're talking.

16:14.054 --> 16:15.288
Ty:
Where are we going?

16:15.322 --> 16:16.722
Wade:
Way out by Greer Lake.

16:16.791 --> 16:18.091
That's three hours
from here!

16:18.125 --> 16:19.358
Wade: That's all
right, I drive fast.

16:19.426 --> 16:22.027
Don't worry about it.
Let's go.

16:22.061 --> 16:23.695
<i>Get your leg in!</i>

16:23.729 --> 16:25.831
(Car peels away)

16:27.746 --> 16:29.746
<i>(Insects buzz)</i>

16:41.259 --> 16:45.328
Wade: Darrell swore there'd be
a '57 around here somewhere.

16:45.562 --> 16:47.263
I thought you said
he was a collector.

16:47.297 --> 16:48.997
This is just a bunch
of junk.

16:49.032 --> 16:50.399
You know
what they say:

16:50.434 --> 16:54.169
One man's junk
is another man's treasure.

16:54.204 --> 16:56.272
Ah! Jackpot.
Right there.

16:58.675 --> 17:00.308
Ty: Yeah, it looks
like the right year.

17:00.343 --> 17:02.944
Wade: Mm-hmm. What'd I tell ya?

17:04.046 --> 17:07.582
Ty: Yeah, well, who knows what
condition the engine's in.

17:07.617 --> 17:09.284
(Hood squeals open)

17:11.185 --> 17:14.789
- Actually, it's in pretty good shape.
- Mm-hmm.

17:14.823 --> 17:16.589
It might not be
a waste of time after all.

17:16.625 --> 17:18.825
Don't look so surprised.

17:18.893 --> 17:20.926
Let's get to work.

17:21.963 --> 17:23.964
Lou: I cannot believe that Lisa
and Dan are back together.

17:23.998 --> 17:25.531
Now don't go over
the deep end here.

17:25.599 --> 17:26.599
I have to tell Grandpa.

17:26.635 --> 17:28.402
No. No! This is not
the kind of news

17:28.470 --> 17:29.403
that your grandpa
wants to hear

17:29.471 --> 17:30.937
from his granddaughter.

17:30.972 --> 17:32.205
Lou:
So what am I supposed to do?

17:32.273 --> 17:33.105
So you're just supposed
to keep it under your hat.

17:33.173 --> 17:34.039
Lou: What?!
Jack: Hey.

17:34.074 --> 17:35.875
Lou:
Hi- hi, grandpa!

17:37.177 --> 17:38.578
You're here!
You...

17:38.646 --> 17:39.612
You look good.

17:39.647 --> 17:41.347
(Jack chuckles)

17:41.415 --> 17:43.750
Are you...
Are you wearing a new shirt?

17:43.817 --> 17:44.817
No.

17:44.885 --> 17:47.420
No? Must be new boots, hey?

17:48.388 --> 17:49.688
No.

17:49.722 --> 17:51.222
Hmm...

17:51.291 --> 17:52.557
You're acting weird.
Stop it.

17:52.592 --> 17:53.658
(Laughs)

17:53.792 --> 17:54.958
I'm not acting weird.

17:59.532 --> 18:00.499
What's wrong
with you?

18:00.533 --> 18:01.633
I can't keep secrets
from Grandpa.

18:01.701 --> 18:03.001
I'm sorr-
I have to tell him.

18:03.068 --> 18:04.835
No! No. No.

18:04.869 --> 18:08.071
It'll be better
if he hears the news from me.

18:08.139 --> 18:10.741
Okay, you're right.
You guys can commiserate.

18:10.809 --> 18:11.742
I mean your love life
actually sucks

18:11.810 --> 18:12.777
worse than his does.

18:12.811 --> 18:14.278
No! That's not
what I meant.

18:14.346 --> 18:15.713
Lou:
Well, it does.

18:15.781 --> 18:17.615
Thank you.
(Slaps hat)

18:18.583 --> 18:20.617
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>It's a good effort,</i>

18:20.685 --> 18:22.084
<i>I just think,</i>
<i>in events like this,</i>

18:22.152 --> 18:23.886
less is more.

18:23.954 --> 18:25.355
Plus, I think the banner

18:25.389 --> 18:26.923
should go on that side
of the room.

18:26.990 --> 18:30.627
And these wild flowers,
they look like weeds.

18:30.661 --> 18:32.862
That's because
they are weeds.

18:32.930 --> 18:34.531
Mallory: You did a nice
job on the vacuuming,

18:34.598 --> 18:37.399
I just think I'm gonna have
to redo everything else.

18:37.467 --> 18:38.967
You know what,
Mallory?

18:39.535 --> 18:42.204
You can redo
the vacuuming too.

18:42.271 --> 18:43.905
Mallory:
What is your problem?

18:43.973 --> 18:44.906
Georgie:
You are!

18:44.974 --> 18:45.974
And you know what?

18:46.042 --> 18:48.009
From now on,
you're on your own!

18:48.077 --> 18:49.345
(Door bangs shut)

18:50.279 --> 18:51.480
Amy:
(Whistles) Come on! Hup!

18:51.514 --> 18:52.547
(Whistling)

18:54.383 --> 18:55.416
Hup! Hup!

18:57.919 --> 19:00.921
Come on! What's going on
with you, Bug?

19:01.857 --> 19:05.560
Why can't you just follow
Spike's lead, huh?

19:08.330 --> 19:11.898
(Sighs)
What am I doing wrong?

19:11.932 --> 19:14.468
Georgie: I can't take it anymore!
She's a demon monster!

19:14.535 --> 19:15.969
Not now, Georgie.

19:16.003 --> 19:17.771
Georgie: You won't believe
what Mallory just did!

19:17.839 --> 19:20.440
Can't you see
that I'm busy?

19:20.475 --> 19:23.243
Why don't you just follow
Mallory's lead for once?

19:23.277 --> 19:25.344
Because I'm not a horse!

19:27.347 --> 19:28.080
Georgie...

19:33.152 --> 19:36.188
Jack: Remember, if we see the
bear, just scare it away.

19:36.222 --> 19:38.357
I don't want you
getting trigger happy.

19:38.392 --> 19:42.460
Yeah, well, Jack,
I lied about the bear.

19:42.495 --> 19:44.596
Then why am I
out here?

19:45.531 --> 19:46.698
Tim: Well, I thought
we'd shoot some targets,

19:46.732 --> 19:48.366
like the old days.

19:49.301 --> 19:50.902
I don't have time
for this.

19:50.936 --> 19:52.504
Some of us have
actual work to do.

19:52.538 --> 19:54.906
Look it, look it,
just...Hang on a second.

19:54.940 --> 19:56.374
<i>This is really good...</i>

19:56.408 --> 19:59.009
You know, it's a good way
to blow off steam

19:59.043 --> 20:01.879
if you've got something
on your chest,

20:01.913 --> 20:03.113
romantically speaking...

20:03.180 --> 20:05.549
I knew I shouldn't have
told you about Lisa.

20:05.583 --> 20:06.717
This is none
of your business.

20:06.751 --> 20:07.818
Just a second, Jack,

20:07.852 --> 20:08.819
I got something
to say.

20:08.853 --> 20:10.421
Then say it.

20:11.623 --> 20:12.688
Okay...

20:14.024 --> 20:17.026
I hate to be the one
that has to say this,

20:17.060 --> 20:21.431
but the other day
when Lou got together with Dan,

20:21.465 --> 20:23.599
he made it sound like...

20:23.634 --> 20:26.969
He and Lisa were getting
back together again.

20:32.107 --> 20:33.875
(Cocks gun)

20:33.910 --> 20:35.777
(Fires repeatedly)

20:35.812 --> 20:37.913
(Cans ting and clatter)

20:47.121 --> 20:48.155
Okay!

20:49.090 --> 20:50.324
(Birds chirp)

20:56.097 --> 20:57.998
(Spike and Bug whinny)

21:05.940 --> 21:08.040
Georgie:
Good boy, Spike.

21:09.009 --> 21:10.042
Good boy.

21:11.178 --> 21:12.244
Whoa...

21:13.514 --> 21:15.381
Yeah... good boy, Spike.

21:16.350 --> 21:17.816
See?

21:17.884 --> 21:20.385
Come on.
(Clucks her tongue)

21:20.453 --> 21:22.320
(Spike whinnies wildly)
Woo!

21:22.388 --> 21:24.356
Woo! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa, Spike!

21:25.324 --> 21:26.358
Whoa! Ungh!

21:30.396 --> 21:32.097
(Whimpering)
Ow... ow...

21:34.833 --> 21:35.867
Help!

21:37.302 --> 21:39.169
Amy!

21:39.237 --> 21:40.270
Anybody?!

21:44.743 --> 21:45.776
Hey, Bug.

21:47.412 --> 21:49.746
Wanna help me up?
It's okay.

21:50.715 --> 21:52.582
Okay.
Come on, let's go.

21:53.951 --> 21:55.519
(Grunts of effort)

21:56.654 --> 21:57.954
Good... good boy.

22:00.958 --> 22:04.260
(Grunting in pain)
Good boy, let's go.

22:04.328 --> 22:05.360
Georgie!

22:06.396 --> 22:07.496
What happened?

22:09.332 --> 22:11.400
Georgie: (Grunting)
I fell, but I'm okay.

22:11.467 --> 22:15.504
No, you're not okay.
Let's get you inside.

22:15.572 --> 22:17.339
Come on.

22:17.373 --> 22:19.441
Georgie:
Thanks, Bug.

22:22.611 --> 22:26.014
Generator, water pump,
carburetor, distributor...

22:26.081 --> 22:27.682
I got everything I need
plus backups.

22:27.716 --> 22:30.384
Yeah. I told you,
Darrell always delivers.

22:30.452 --> 22:31.385
Yeah, where is he anyway?

22:31.453 --> 22:32.754
I should probably
thank him.

22:32.788 --> 22:34.388
<i>(Dog barks nearby)</i>

22:34.423 --> 22:36.623
Never mind about that.
We should uh...

22:36.658 --> 22:38.058
We should get going here.

22:38.092 --> 22:39.159
Okay, well,
give me a hand with this.

22:41.663 --> 22:42.629
(Dog barks)

22:42.664 --> 22:44.097
Crap!

22:44.131 --> 22:45.198
Come on,
get in here!

22:47.035 --> 22:48.602
<i>(Dog barks viciously)</i>

22:50.038 --> 22:52.172
(Dog barks viciously)

22:52.206 --> 22:53.906
Ty:
What-what is that?

22:53.941 --> 22:55.174
A dog.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.508
I know it's a dog!
What's it doing out there?

22:56.543 --> 22:58.945
<i>Why didn't Darrell</i>
<i>tie him up?</i>

22:58.979 --> 23:01.647
Darrell doesn't exactly
know we're here.

23:01.682 --> 23:03.148
I thought you said
he was a friend of yours.

23:03.183 --> 23:04.316
He is a friend of mine,
but...

23:04.350 --> 23:05.384
He's in Arizona
right now,

23:05.418 --> 23:07.620
and I couldn't get
a hold of him.

23:07.654 --> 23:09.020
I knew he'd be fine
with us

23:09.055 --> 23:10.622
coming out here
and helping ourselves,

23:10.656 --> 23:12.223
I just forgot
about that dog.

23:12.257 --> 23:13.324
(Barking viciously)

23:13.358 --> 23:14.492
I knew it.

23:14.526 --> 23:16.061
I knew coming here with you
was a bad idea.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.229
(Sighs)
Just... relax.

23:18.263 --> 23:19.230
You got a cell phone,
right?

23:19.264 --> 23:20.465
Call up your vet buddy,

23:20.499 --> 23:23.101
tell him to get here
with tranquilizer gun.

23:23.135 --> 23:24.102
It's in my hoodie.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.436
(Growling)

23:26.471 --> 23:29.573
I think the dog just ate it
for lunch.

23:29.608 --> 23:30.674
(Sighs)

23:34.600 --> 23:35.734
Amy:
Well, the good news is

23:35.768 --> 23:38.036
I'm pretty sure
it's just a sprain,

23:38.070 --> 23:40.104
but if it gets any worse -
it hurts a lot -

23:40.139 --> 23:41.906
we'll take you
into the clinic, okay?

23:44.143 --> 23:45.944
Are you mad at me?

23:45.978 --> 23:48.446
No, I'm not mad
at you.

23:49.715 --> 23:50.849
But there is a reason

23:50.883 --> 23:53.116
why I told you not to ride
those horses.

23:53.151 --> 23:54.918
I was mad at Mallory,

23:54.986 --> 23:56.686
and I guess
I just wasn't thinking.

23:56.721 --> 23:58.455
I'm really sorry.

23:58.489 --> 24:00.157
It's okay.

24:00.225 --> 24:02.893
I'm sorry
I snapped at you.

24:02.961 --> 24:04.862
I can't figure out
what's going on with Bug,

24:04.896 --> 24:08.231
and I was just really
frustrated.

24:09.266 --> 24:11.600
What will happen
if you can't solve his problem?

24:11.634 --> 24:12.935
I don't know.

24:13.003 --> 24:14.904
His owner might have
to sell him.

24:15.873 --> 24:17.139
That's too bad.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.976
He really helped me today.

24:20.043 --> 24:21.244
I know.

24:21.278 --> 24:23.346
He's a pretty special
little horse.

24:25.081 --> 24:28.083
<i>Okay,</i>
<i>i'll make you a deal.</i>

24:28.150 --> 24:30.051
I won't give up on Bug,

24:30.119 --> 24:32.653
if you promise
you won't give up on Mallory.

24:35.124 --> 24:36.191
I promise.

24:36.259 --> 24:37.792
Deal.
(Chuckles)

24:40.461 --> 24:43.497
Where did he go?
I can hear him.

24:45.066 --> 24:46.666
Okay,
I got a plan.

24:47.635 --> 24:49.569
Darrell got this dog
in the late nineties,

24:49.637 --> 24:52.006
so he's probably pretty old
and deaf now.

24:52.073 --> 24:53.941
I say all we do is wait
for him to fall asleep

24:53.975 --> 24:55.442
and we make a run
for it.

24:55.476 --> 24:56.809
That's your plan?

24:56.877 --> 24:58.011
You got a better one,
let's hear it.

24:58.078 --> 24:59.212
No, I don't,

24:59.246 --> 25:01.080
but that doesn't mean
yours stinks any less.

25:01.148 --> 25:02.548
I don't care how old
that dog is,

25:02.616 --> 25:03.549
as soon as we open
that door

25:03.617 --> 25:04.617
he's gonna hear us.

25:04.684 --> 25:05.751
Ah, give me a break,
will ya?

25:05.786 --> 25:07.320
I didn't know
this was gonna happen.

25:07.388 --> 25:09.022
Every time I get involved
with you, Wade,

25:09.089 --> 25:10.123
something goes wrong.

25:10.157 --> 25:11.324
Every time.

25:11.358 --> 25:13.358
I was trying
to help you out.

25:13.426 --> 25:15.193
I had the best
of intentions, I did.

25:15.228 --> 25:17.595
Oh, I'm sure you did.

25:17.663 --> 25:20.899
I just can't win
with you, can I?

25:20.967 --> 25:23.201
No matter what I do,

25:23.269 --> 25:25.570
I'm always gonna be
the bogeyman to you.

25:25.638 --> 25:29.106
That's right,
except you're real.

25:29.141 --> 25:30.607
I get it, Ty.

25:30.675 --> 25:32.743
I was a crap stepdad,
I know.

25:32.811 --> 25:34.111
But you...

25:34.146 --> 25:37.481
You were no ray of sunshine
yourself there for awhile.

25:37.515 --> 25:39.683
We both made
our share of mistakes.

25:39.717 --> 25:40.884
Okay, I can't listen
to this.

25:40.919 --> 25:41.852
(Dog snarls viciously,
starts barking)

25:41.920 --> 25:42.853
(Slams door shut)
Ungh!

25:42.921 --> 25:43.854
Wade:
Are you nuts?!

25:43.922 --> 25:45.455
(Snarling and barking)

25:48.559 --> 25:50.226
I can't believe
I'm stuck in here with you.

25:50.261 --> 25:53.330
Yeah, well, it's no picnic
for me either.

25:55.032 --> 25:56.532
Jack.

25:56.567 --> 25:58.734
Well, it's good
to see you.

25:58.802 --> 26:00.169
Hello, Dan.

26:01.338 --> 26:04.206
So I hear you're one
of Lou's new clients.

26:04.240 --> 26:07.076
Actually, she just called
to inform me

26:07.110 --> 26:09.644
that she's too busy
to take on new clients,

26:09.679 --> 26:10.946
which is odd

26:10.981 --> 26:15.617
because I'm pretty sure
that I was her only client.

26:15.651 --> 26:17.151
If Lou's looking
to run her business

26:17.186 --> 26:19.454
right into the ground,

26:19.488 --> 26:21.322
she's off
to a good start.

26:21.357 --> 26:25.759
Well, maybe you were
too "small potatoes" for her.

26:25.794 --> 26:27.261
Excuse me?

26:27.296 --> 26:30.431
Hard not to take it
personally, I know,

26:30.466 --> 26:32.532
but Lou is exceptional
at what she does

26:32.566 --> 26:35.102
and her dance card's
probably pretty full.

26:35.136 --> 26:37.304
She might've moved on
a little too quickly,

26:37.338 --> 26:41.141
but... that happens sometimes,
doesn't it?

26:44.012 --> 26:45.912
Have a good day.

26:49.516 --> 26:52.518
Amy: So Bug refuses to
cooperate with the lead horse.

26:52.552 --> 26:54.253
I've tried
ground driving him,

26:54.287 --> 26:55.687
I've switched up
his feed,

26:55.722 --> 26:57.123
but nothing seems
to work.

26:57.157 --> 26:58.224
Yeah, he's a stubborn
little bugger,

26:58.258 --> 26:59.825
- isn't he?
- He is.

26:59.893 --> 27:01.360
It's funny.
He...

27:01.395 --> 27:02.895
He doesn't really seem to like
the company of other horses,

27:02.929 --> 27:04.762
but he loves people.

27:04.796 --> 27:08.299
Yup! That's 'cause
of my daughter, Emma.

27:08.334 --> 27:10.268
<i>She loves to spoil</i>
<i>the horses.</i>

27:10.302 --> 27:12.303
<i>Bug is her favourite.</i>

27:12.371 --> 27:15.840
She used to bottle feed him
when he was a foal.

27:15.874 --> 27:19.277
But Bug's too well bred
to be a pet,

27:20.211 --> 27:21.278
so keep trying, okay?

27:21.312 --> 27:22.979
I will do.

27:23.014 --> 27:25.249
Come on, Emma,
time to go.

27:30.588 --> 27:31.621
You got it?

27:35.260 --> 27:36.325
All right.

27:40.330 --> 27:41.264
Want some jerky?

27:41.298 --> 27:42.865
No, I don't.

27:48.172 --> 27:51.574
Why do you wanna keep
that old truck anyway?

27:51.641 --> 27:52.740
Seems to cause you
more problems

27:52.808 --> 27:54.676
than it's worth.

27:56.912 --> 27:58.846
Look, man...

27:58.881 --> 28:01.383
I know this trying to talk
and be civil thing

28:01.451 --> 28:02.884
isn't easy.

28:06.322 --> 28:07.255
Fine.

28:07.290 --> 28:10.424
Uh, I got that truck

28:10.459 --> 28:12.826
just before
I came to Heartland.

28:17.899 --> 28:20.701
There's, uh,
some memories then.

28:21.669 --> 28:23.170
Yup.

28:23.205 --> 28:25.238
Care to elaborate?

28:27.941 --> 28:30.042
(Sighs heavily)
Um...

28:33.280 --> 28:34.314
There was this one time

28:34.848 --> 28:38.418
I went to this party
that Amy was at,

28:38.486 --> 28:40.920
right after
I got to Heartland,

28:40.954 --> 28:42.922
and I ended up
punching out some guy,

28:42.990 --> 28:44.924
and uh...

28:44.992 --> 28:46.191
Amy didn't like that
too much, so...

28:46.226 --> 28:47.459
She left,

28:47.494 --> 28:49.795
started walking home,
and...

28:49.830 --> 28:51.130
I followed her,

28:51.197 --> 28:52.431
picked her up
on the side of the road

28:52.997 --> 28:54.431
and uh...

28:54.599 --> 28:55.801
she gave me a hard time

28:55.836 --> 28:57.969
because I didn't have any heat
(Taps dash) In my truck.

28:58.004 --> 28:59.170
There was no heater.
(Laughs)

29:01.774 --> 29:05.043
Who was the guy
you punched out?

29:05.077 --> 29:07.545
He was her boyfriend
at the time.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.413
(Laughs)

29:09.481 --> 29:10.615
I guess that worked out
pretty well for you then,

29:10.683 --> 29:12.050
didn't it?

29:20.591 --> 29:21.992
Why do you think
a nice girl like Amy

29:22.027 --> 29:25.729
wants to hang out
with a guy like you?

29:27.632 --> 29:28.965
I ask myself that
every day.

29:30.834 --> 29:32.969
She is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

29:34.271 --> 29:35.672
Hmm.

29:36.640 --> 29:39.508
I know you're probably not
gonna believe this, but...

29:39.543 --> 29:42.545
I feel the same way
about your mom.

29:44.414 --> 29:48.717
She always made me wanna be
a better man all around.

29:48.751 --> 29:50.118
<i>It took me too long</i>
<i>to realize that though,</i>

29:50.153 --> 29:52.020
<i>I think.</i>

29:52.055 --> 29:53.722
Yeah, way too long.

29:57.927 --> 30:00.261
I asked her
to marry me again.

30:01.196 --> 30:04.431
She said she wanted
to think about it for a while,

30:04.465 --> 30:07.201
and then she ended up
saying no.

30:08.436 --> 30:10.170
That was that.

30:13.641 --> 30:16.810
Well, I guess you and me have
got something in common then.

30:16.844 --> 30:19.213
I asked Amy to marry me,

30:19.247 --> 30:22.882
and she didn't really
say no, but...

30:22.917 --> 30:25.551
We uh...
We agreed to wait.

30:26.853 --> 30:28.554
Wait for what?

30:30.457 --> 30:34.093
Uh, I don't know.
Just uh... just wait.

30:40.233 --> 30:41.499
Do you hear that?

30:41.567 --> 30:43.335
(Birds chirp outside)

30:46.672 --> 30:47.672
He stopped barking.

30:47.740 --> 30:49.173
Yeah.
Must be sleeping.

30:50.876 --> 30:52.043
(Insects buzz)

30:59.917 --> 31:01.285
Wade: (Quietly)
I think he's gone.

31:01.319 --> 31:03.254
Ty: (Whispering) All right.
Let's get outta here.

31:03.288 --> 31:04.788
Wade:
What about the parts?

31:04.856 --> 31:05.922
Ty:
What about the dog?

31:05.990 --> 31:07.358
Wade: I'm not leaving
without 'em.

31:12.263 --> 31:13.296
All right...

31:13.364 --> 31:16.499
<i>(Dog barks in the distance)</i>

31:16.567 --> 31:17.767
Wade:
Go!

31:17.834 --> 31:19.402
Ty:
Run! Run! Run!

31:21.538 --> 31:22.772
(Dog barks)

31:22.839 --> 31:24.206
Ty: Run!
Wade: Holy crap!

31:24.275 --> 31:26.142
Ty:
Come on, Wade! Go!

31:28.278 --> 31:29.811
(Grunts of effort)

31:31.381 --> 31:33.348
(Dog barks viciously)

31:33.416 --> 31:34.549
Ty:
Agh! Agh!

31:35.752 --> 31:36.951
Both:
(Panting)

31:36.986 --> 31:38.387
What're you gonna do
about it?

31:38.421 --> 31:40.389
What're you gonna do
about it, huh?

31:42.158 --> 31:43.692
Oh man...
I need a beer.

31:43.726 --> 31:46.260
Yeah, me too.
(Unclear comment)

31:50.505 --> 31:52.239
What happened</i> <i>to you?

31:52.306 --> 31:53.574
Never mind.

31:54.509 --> 31:56.476
I need to tell you something.

31:56.511 --> 31:58.078
Okay.

31:58.112 --> 32:00.047
I'm not just some kid
you can push around.

32:00.081 --> 32:02.181
I know.
I'm sorry.

32:02.215 --> 32:03.550
You are?

32:03.617 --> 32:07.587
I realize now that I may have
gone a little overboard.

32:07.655 --> 32:10.156
All right,
a lot overboard.

32:10.190 --> 32:11.925
I just wanted everything
to be perfect.

32:11.992 --> 32:13.459
Somewhere along the way,

32:13.493 --> 32:15.194
I'd realized that
I turned into Lou,

32:15.228 --> 32:17.063
only worse.

32:17.097 --> 32:19.097
I was drunk with power...

32:19.131 --> 32:22.000
But it was all in the pursuit
of greatness.

32:22.068 --> 32:24.836
Okay. You don't have
to lay it on so thick.

32:24.871 --> 32:26.972
I accept your apology.

32:27.006 --> 32:28.106
Good.

32:28.140 --> 32:30.175
So you won't mind redoing
the vacuuming

32:30.209 --> 32:31.376
in the living room?

32:31.444 --> 32:33.545
Actually, I have to show you
something first.

32:42.487 --> 32:44.521
"Happy Retirement Larry"?!

32:44.556 --> 32:45.890
They gave me
the wrong cake!

32:45.924 --> 32:46.958
You think?

32:46.992 --> 32:48.893
Lou's gonna kill me.

32:48.927 --> 32:50.259
Don't worry,
we can fix this.

32:50.294 --> 32:51.527
How?

32:51.562 --> 32:53.362
I've watched every cake
decorating show on TV

32:53.397 --> 32:55.364
and I'm practically an expert,

32:55.399 --> 32:57.033
but you have to do
exactly what I say.

32:58.435 --> 33:00.336
(Door creaks open)

33:01.538 --> 33:03.272
Jack: This is a bad time.
You're working.

33:03.307 --> 33:04.741
Mm-mm.
I'm updating my blog.

33:04.775 --> 33:06.742
Come in.
Sit down.

33:07.677 --> 33:09.344
Yeah,
I should be working,

33:09.378 --> 33:11.780
but that would require
actually having clients.

33:11.815 --> 33:14.483
Jack: That's what I need
to talk to you about.

33:14.517 --> 33:16.218
I want you to call Dan

33:16.252 --> 33:17.953
and tell him you want
his business back.

33:17.988 --> 33:19.054
Grandpa...

33:19.122 --> 33:20.689
I won't let you sacrifice
your company

33:20.724 --> 33:22.790
because you're worried
about my ego.

33:22.825 --> 33:24.692
I don't need Dan.

33:24.727 --> 33:27.161
I know how much his business
would be worth to you.

33:27.229 --> 33:30.098
Yeah, it would,
but you're worth more to me,

33:30.132 --> 33:32.166
so stop telling me
what to do.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.168
It's my decision,
not yours.

33:35.137 --> 33:37.005
That's enough
about work.

33:37.072 --> 33:38.438
I haven't talked to you
in a while,

33:38.472 --> 33:40.841
and I want you to tell me
how you're doing.

33:40.908 --> 33:42.943
Oh, I'm all right.

33:49.150 --> 33:51.417
<i>The other day,</i>
<i>I swore I saw Lisa</i>

33:51.485 --> 33:53.520
walking down the street,

33:54.521 --> 33:58.524
then it turned out
not to be her after all.

34:07.934 --> 34:09.934
(Crickets chirp outside)

34:12.271 --> 34:13.772
(Rail drags in the sand)

34:13.839 --> 34:15.406
<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

34:15.440 --> 34:16.574
Amy: Well, my mom used
to know this woman

34:16.608 --> 34:19.476
who trained horses
to be guide animals.

34:19.511 --> 34:21.411
Georgie: Like seeing eye
dogs, except horses?

34:21.446 --> 34:23.246
Amy:
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

34:23.315 --> 34:24.716
When I found out that
Robert's daughter was blind,

34:24.784 --> 34:26.016
it just made sense.

34:26.083 --> 34:27.417
Wait.

34:27.451 --> 34:30.187
Weren't you hired to make Bug
into a chuck wagon horse?

34:30.254 --> 34:34.725
Amy: Yeah, but I think he's
capable of so much more.

34:34.793 --> 34:36.458
I just have to prove it.

34:47.571 --> 34:48.504
Okay, Bug,
(Clucks tongue)

34:48.572 --> 34:49.605
Let's go.

34:53.409 --> 34:54.777
Keep going...

35:06.923 --> 35:07.956
Keep going.

35:11.260 --> 35:12.293
Good boy.

35:17.232 --> 35:18.432
Woo-hoo!
(Clapping)

35:19.400 --> 35:21.468
<i>That was amazing!</i>

35:21.502 --> 35:24.471
(Laughing)
Oh, Bug, you're so good!

35:24.539 --> 35:27.108
<i>Good job, Bug!</i>
<i>Good boy!</i>

35:29.744 --> 35:31.745
Amy: So I guess Wade
really came through, huh?

35:33.180 --> 35:36.116
Ty: Yeah, and he almost got
us killed in the process.

35:37.885 --> 35:39.585
But he did help, right?

35:39.620 --> 35:41.755
And he didn't ask
for anything in return.

35:41.789 --> 35:44.124
What's your point, Amy?

35:44.158 --> 35:45.891
I just think with everything
that's happened,

35:45.925 --> 35:48.193
maybe it's time to consider
the possibility

35:48.228 --> 35:50.595
Wade isn't the same guy
he used to be.

35:50.630 --> 35:52.030
Just because he acted
like a human

35:52.065 --> 35:53.398
for five minutes,

35:53.432 --> 35:55.267
doesn't mean
he's any different.

35:55.301 --> 35:57.135
Your mom believed
that he'd changed.

35:57.169 --> 35:59.237
That's why she got back
together with him.

35:59.272 --> 36:01.839
And then she broke it off, Amy.

36:01.874 --> 36:02.840
Probably because
she realized

36:02.875 --> 36:03.908
he's the same
destructive person

36:03.942 --> 36:06.077
that he always was.

36:09.947 --> 36:12.516
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>That's not true.</i>

36:12.584 --> 36:13.584
Lily told me why
she turned down

36:13.652 --> 36:15.653
Wade's marriage proposal.

36:17.389 --> 36:20.090
She was scared,
but not of Wade.

36:21.593 --> 36:23.927
She was scared
of losing you.

36:26.493 --> 36:28.027
She said that?

36:29.733 --> 36:30.767
Yeah.

36:31.735 --> 36:33.068
She thought
if she married Wade,

36:33.136 --> 36:34.170
then...

36:34.838 --> 36:38.941
Then you'd never talk
to her again.

36:38.975 --> 36:41.010
She broke it off
because of you.

36:41.611 --> 36:44.179
(Wind chimes tinkle softly
in the breeze)

36:49.503 --> 36:51.705
 Never heard of a
seeing-eye horse before.

36:52.144 --> 36:55.449
<i>Amy:</i> <i>Buck has all the qualities</i>
<i>of a perfect guide animal.</i>

36:55.450 --> 36:57.449
In my opinion he
was born to do this.

36:58.250 --> 36:59.999
I don't know,
just don't seem right to me.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.819
I wanna show you
something.

37:14.498 --> 37:17.600
<i>Amy:</i> <i>All right, Emma,</i>
<i>you can start walking.</i>

37:17.668 --> 37:19.735
You don't need to be afraid.
Bug will take care of you.

37:28.011 --> 37:30.913
<i>That's good!</i>
<i>You look great.</i>

37:41.657 --> 37:43.792
Now, I know
it seems unusual,

37:43.859 --> 37:46.859
but miniature horses with the right
temperament can be great guide animals.

37:49.164 --> 37:53.934
Since Emma has grown up around horses,
I figure it's just about perfect.

37:54.002 --> 37:55.202
Now, there are people

37:55.236 --> 37:56.670
who specifically
train miniature horses

37:56.738 --> 37:58.806
to be guide animals.

37:58.873 --> 38:02.242
So, if you want,
I can make a few calls.

38:03.745 --> 38:05.913
<i>Robert:</i>
<i>One thing's for sure.</i>

38:05.981 --> 38:08.681
Bug's a lousy
chuck wagon horse.

38:10.918 --> 38:14.221
<i>If this is what</i>
<i>he's meant to do,</i>

38:14.255 --> 38:16.456
<i>then I'm all for it.</i>

38:18.292 --> 38:19.593
Look at her go.

38:22.730 --> 38:24.763
You're doing great
honey!

38:26.433 --> 38:27.699
<i>That a girl!</i>

38:27.767 --> 38:30.068
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Way to go, Emma!</i>

38:40.779 --> 38:42.880
Wade:
I got your message.

38:43.949 --> 38:45.783
What do you need now?

38:45.851 --> 38:49.820
Some money?
A kidney?

38:51.524 --> 38:53.424
Do you love her?

38:57.295 --> 38:58.695
I need to hear you say it,
Wade.

39:02.167 --> 39:04.901
Yeah.

39:04.935 --> 39:07.404
I love your mother
very much.

39:12.376 --> 39:13.409
Okay.

39:14.744 --> 39:17.313
<i>Go back to Vancouver then.</i>

39:17.347 --> 39:20.916
Tell her I won't stand
in your way anymore.

39:20.950 --> 39:23.419
What made you
change your mind?

39:23.453 --> 39:24.520
Uh...

39:26.323 --> 39:27.456
I guess I realized
I'm a little too old

39:27.491 --> 39:28.790
to believe in the bogeyman.

39:30.793 --> 39:31.859
(Snorts)

39:34.463 --> 39:35.530
All right.

39:43.439 --> 39:45.072
Let me get that hose
outta the way.

39:45.106 --> 39:46.973
Try it.

39:47.008 --> 39:48.075
There.

39:49.578 --> 39:51.445
Lou:
This is very impressive.

39:51.479 --> 39:52.446
It was all your vision,
Lou.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.582
I simply brought it
to life.

39:54.616 --> 39:57.451
It's good,
but I have notes.

39:57.485 --> 39:59.253
I'm not sure about
the carnations.

39:59.287 --> 40:01.654
I'm thinking...
Wild flowers.

40:02.590 --> 40:06.892
And the banner should really be
on that side of the room.

40:06.927 --> 40:08.561
Told you.

40:08.596 --> 40:10.296
Ooh! This must be
the cake I ordered.

40:10.331 --> 40:11.364
Don't you wanna wait
for the big reveal

40:11.432 --> 40:13.099
at the end of dinner?

40:13.133 --> 40:15.435
Are you kidding?
This cake cost a fortune.

40:15.502 --> 40:17.669
I wanna see
what it looks like.

40:19.005 --> 40:20.606
<i>Hmm...</i>

40:20.640 --> 40:21.673
Mallory...

40:21.708 --> 40:24.076
I know. I'm sorry,
I screwed up.

40:24.144 --> 40:26.245
Well, I mean,
with a fabulous cake like this,

40:26.312 --> 40:27.679
<i>we should really be using</i>
<i>the silver platter,</i>

40:27.748 --> 40:29.181
don't you think?

40:29.249 --> 40:31.383
You're right.
My bad.

40:31.417 --> 40:34.585
Lou: Okay! Let's check on
your progress in the kitchen.

40:34.620 --> 40:35.686
Mallory:
Hmm!

40:36.655 --> 40:38.689
<i>(Truck rumbles to a halt)</i>

40:43.629 --> 40:47.232
Amy: Well, well!
You got your truck fixed!

40:47.299 --> 40:49.399
Ty:
Yeah! As good as new,

40:51.169 --> 40:52.502
thanks to Wade.

40:53.604 --> 40:55.973
So you talked to him
then?

40:56.007 --> 40:59.910
Yeah. He's on his way back
to Vancouver right now.

40:59.978 --> 41:02.312
I'm not a kid anymore,
Amy.

41:02.380 --> 41:05.614
All that stuff is uh...
It's behind me now.

41:06.583 --> 41:08.684
It can't hurt me anymore.

41:14.758 --> 41:18.227
Lou: Well, I think this
occasion calls for a speech

41:18.295 --> 41:20.163
from the future
Dr. Borden.

41:20.230 --> 41:22.197
Ty:
No! I don't do speeches, guys.

41:22.231 --> 41:24.032
Lou: Come on, just a
few inspiring words

41:24.100 --> 41:25.333
before you embark

41:25.367 --> 41:26.701
on the most important
academic journey

41:26.769 --> 41:27.869
of your life.

41:27.937 --> 41:29.204
Right!
No pressure, huh?

41:30.139 --> 41:31.339
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>Come on, Ty.</i>

41:31.373 --> 41:33.508
Okay. Um...
(Clears throat)

41:36.478 --> 41:38.346
First of all,
I'd like to say that

41:38.380 --> 41:41.015
I can't believe that you guys
went to all this trouble

41:41.082 --> 41:42.216
just for me.

41:42.284 --> 41:44.084
<i>Um, this is amazing.</i>

41:44.152 --> 41:46.754
I should be the one
making dinner for you.

41:46.789 --> 41:48.389
After all, I wouldn't be
starting vet school

41:48.424 --> 41:49.824
in a few weeks

41:49.858 --> 41:53.260
if it wasn't for the people
around this table right now.

41:53.328 --> 41:54.695
So...Thank you,

41:55.996 --> 41:57.063
all of you.

41:59.266 --> 42:01.835
<i>Jack:</i> <i>Well, we couldn't
be</i> <i>more proud, Ty,</i>

42:01.869 --> 42:05.071
and I think that
deserves a toast!

42:05.139 --> 42:07.140
To kicking butt
in vet school!

42:07.174 --> 42:09.375
All: To kicking butt!
(Glasses clink)

42:09.443 --> 42:10.944
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Cheers!</i>

42:10.978 --> 42:12.278
Mallory:
Okay, everyone dig in.

42:12.313 --> 42:14.612
Don't hesitate to tell me
how great everything is.

42:14.647 --> 42:15.714
All:
(Chuckling)

42:16.916 --> 42:19.584
(Horses whinny
in the distance)

42:21.620 --> 42:24.256
Lou:
So this is where you are.

42:24.290 --> 42:26.725
You disappeared after dinner.

42:28.427 --> 42:30.261
<i>Are you all right?</i>

42:30.295 --> 42:31.362
Yeah...

42:32.597 --> 42:35.066
I guess I'm just happy.

42:37.002 --> 42:38.469
Is that why
you're crying?

42:38.503 --> 42:39.737
(Laughs)

42:41.606 --> 42:43.407
I was thinking...

42:44.609 --> 42:47.377
Ty used to be the boy
in the loft,

42:47.411 --> 42:51.381
and sometimes I still
think of him that way.

42:51.415 --> 42:53.516
But he grew up.

42:53.550 --> 42:57.620
I mean, he is this amazing
young man now and...

42:57.654 --> 42:58.688
(Sighs)

43:00.224 --> 43:02.024
He's the kind of man

43:02.058 --> 43:06.762
that I always thought
I'd spend my life with.

43:06.796 --> 43:10.165
And when he asked me
to marry him,

43:10.200 --> 43:13.202
I said I wanted to wait,
but...

43:16.206 --> 43:17.273
But...?

43:19.574 --> 43:21.709
I don't know
what I'm waiting for.

43:25.714 --> 43:26.781
(Sighs heavily)
