WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:05.088
It seems today
that all you see

00:05.172 --> 00:08.258
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.342 --> 00:11.553
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.637 --> 00:14.973
On which we used to rely?

00:15.057 --> 00:18.185
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.310 --> 00:21.563
Lucky there's a man
who positively can do

00:21.647 --> 00:23.023
All the things that make us

00:23.148 --> 00:26.151
Aah!
(grunting)

00:26.235 --> 00:28.111
Ah, ow, damn it!

00:28.195 --> 00:29.279
Peter,
are you all right?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.031
No, no, I think
you should call somebody.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.157
Ma'am, are
you all right?

00:32.241 --> 00:34.201
I can't... breathe.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.744
Oh, God, I think she
punctured a lung.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.204
Aw, damn it,
look at my foot.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.122
It's already starting
to swell up.

00:39.248 --> 00:40.749
God, I'm looking forward
to this week.

00:40.832 --> 00:41.834
Freaking swelled foot all week.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.085
You know, we should-we should...

00:43.168 --> 00:45.254
You should probably go ahead
and shut that off.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.428
Oh, hey, Quagmire,
how was Florida?

00:53.512 --> 00:55.055
Oh, it was great.
And guess what?

00:55.138 --> 00:57.558
I smuggled a whole bunch
of fireworks back in my anus.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.935
Uh, Quagmire, fireworks
aren't illegal here.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.478
You could have just
put them in your car

01:01.562 --> 01:02.563
and driven them up here.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.231
(scoffs)
Yeah, that's just as fun.

01:08.527 --> 01:09.570
All right, Meg.

01:09.653 --> 01:13.490
-You be David Koresh and I'll be a heavy-
-handed FBI agent.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.992
Go!
(screaming)

01:16.410 --> 01:17.494
(continues screaming)

01:17.578 --> 01:18.662
Hey, you.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.080
You're a crazy person.

01:20.163 --> 01:23.000
Come out of there, you.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.293
Quagmire, check it out.

01:24.376 --> 01:27.045
I took ten M-80s and
stuck 'em all together.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.797
I call it Peter Griffin's

01:28.881 --> 01:31.383
bunker-busting
mega-ultra-super...

01:31.466 --> 01:32.885
(screams)

01:32.968 --> 01:34.553
Holy crap!

01:34.636 --> 01:36.054
(all scream)

01:36.138 --> 01:37.139
Oh, my God!

01:37.222 --> 01:38.640
You blew off
all your fingers!

01:38.765 --> 01:39.766
What happened?

01:39.850 --> 01:40.893
Oh, my God!

01:40.976 --> 01:44.730
You know, no huge hurry, but I'm
sort of out of juice over here.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.023
Bone-dry.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.066
There's one
of Dad's fingers.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.568
We have to hurry!

01:49.651 --> 01:51.778
I learned in Biology if you
get them back soon enough,

01:51.862 --> 01:52.863
they can be
reattached.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.407
What's all the commotion?

01:56.700 --> 01:57.743
Hey, there's
one of 'em.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.373
Peter, look out!

02:03.457 --> 02:04.458
(screams)

02:04.541 --> 02:05.542
(grunts)

02:05.626 --> 02:07.044
Go on, Jesse.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.338
Make your peeps and poops.

02:09.421 --> 02:13.050
Mmm, that's gonna feel good
for Jesse.

02:18.514 --> 02:19.973
Mmm.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.108
Mmm.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.537
Damn it.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.706
Maybe if we make it mad,
it'll come down here

02:44.790 --> 02:46.500
and we can catch it
and get the finger.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.584
Hey, bird.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.628
Your poop is
white and green.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.005
You're the laughingstock
of the poop world.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.884
Ah, yeah, ah, yeah,
I knew that would get you.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.052
Ah, ah, come here.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.887
Yeah, you little son of a bitch,
come here!

02:58.971 --> 03:00.305
Hey, stop, stop it,
stop pecking me!

03:00.389 --> 03:01.807
(Peter yelling, bird chirping)

03:01.890 --> 03:04.560
(gunshot)

03:04.643 --> 03:06.061
Ah, thanks, Joe.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.980
Let's plant a knife on him
just to be safe.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.106
Eh... good thinking.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.149
Yeah, I know
how these things go down.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.073
Uh, hey there.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.741
We were supposed
to have brunch this morning.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.034
Oh, yeah, sorry.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.119
I-I had a late night.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.537
Late night, huh?

03:23.620 --> 03:24.746
What's her name, Brian?

03:24.830 --> 03:25.831
What are you
talking about?

03:25.914 --> 03:26.957
Oh, spare me
the theatrics.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.041
I see the signs.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.085
The excuses for
why we can't hang out,

03:30.169 --> 03:31.378
the inside-out collar.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.172
If I didn't recognize
what was going on here,

03:33.255 --> 03:35.174
I'd have to be as dim
as those retirees

03:35.257 --> 03:36.884
I entertain every Thursday.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.221
There's a hole in
the bottom of the sea

03:41.305 --> 03:43.223
There's a hole in
the bottom of the sea

03:43.307 --> 03:45.517
There's a hole,
there's a hole

03:45.601 --> 03:48.145
There's a hole in the
bottom of the sea

03:48.228 --> 03:49.730
Whoa-ho-ho, all right.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.064
We're getting
a little faster here now.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.357
And you know what?

03:52.441 --> 03:53.817
I think there's something else
down there

03:53.901 --> 03:55.027
in the bottom of the sea.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.487
Something that you'll be able
to relate to.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.740
There's a tube in the
throat of the elderly man

03:59.823 --> 04:01.825
In the hospital bed
on the frog on the log

04:01.909 --> 04:03.577
In the hole in the
bottom of the sea

04:03.660 --> 04:05.537
There's a tube in the
throat of the elderly man

04:05.621 --> 04:07.497
In the hospital bed
on the frog on the log

04:07.581 --> 04:09.666
In the hole in the
bottom of the sea

04:09.750 --> 04:11.251
There's a hole,
there's a hole

04:11.335 --> 04:13.629
There's a hole in the
bottom of the sea

04:13.712 --> 04:16.507
Oh, whoa,
what is this?

04:16.590 --> 04:19.760
There's a birthday cake
for Mr. Cohen on the frog

04:19.843 --> 04:23.555
On the log in the hole
in the bottom of the sea

04:23.639 --> 04:25.891
There's a birthday
cake for Mr. Cohen

04:25.974 --> 04:28.143
In the hole in the
bottom of the sea

04:28.227 --> 04:29.269
Get a nurse.

04:29.353 --> 04:31.313
There's a hole,
there's a hole

04:31.396 --> 04:34.107
There's a hole in the
bottom of the sea.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.109
Look, Brian, I think
it's wonderful you've found

04:36.193 --> 04:37.903
a young lady willing
to stoop to your level.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.112
When do I get
to meet her?

04:39.196 --> 04:40.197
No, no, no way.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.281
Oh... I see.

04:41.365 --> 04:42.533
I get it;
she's hideous.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.784
She is not hideous.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.077
Oh, well,
let me ask you something.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.453
Does she have an alibi?

04:46.537 --> 04:48.080
For what? Why would
she need an alibi?

04:48.163 --> 04:49.998
So you're saying
she does not have an alibi?

04:50.082 --> 04:51.333
Well, no.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.794
Okay, so we've established
she ain't got no alibi.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.420
She ugly, she ugly

04:55.504 --> 04:56.964
U-G-L-Y

04:57.047 --> 04:58.173
She ain't got no alibi

04:58.257 --> 04:59.967
She ugly
Screw off.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.510
M, she's major ugly

05:01.593 --> 05:03.095
O, she's fat and pugly

05:03.178 --> 05:04.638
O, my God, no

05:04.721 --> 05:07.140
The cow says "moo."

05:09.935 --> 05:11.937
Here's to Peter getting
his fingers back.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.105
Thanks, Joe.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.274
Oh, boy, I tell you,
I haven't felt this good

05:15.357 --> 05:17.943
since I came up with that
new place to hide my porn.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.320
Have a good day,
sweetie.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.698
(exhales)

05:23.407 --> 05:24.408
(beeping)

05:24.950 --> 05:27.953
(whirring)

05:35.294 --> 05:37.171
-Hey, Greg.
-Afternoon, Mr. Griffin.

05:37.254 --> 05:38.422
Mrs. Griffin
out today?

05:38.505 --> 05:39.882
Shoppin'.
Ah.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.594
(electronic twittering)

06:12.206 --> 06:13.582
Ah, she's hot.

06:13.790 --> 06:14.958
All right,
last call, fellas.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.251
It's closing time.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.794
Aw, crap, I'm not
even half-buzzed.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.088
Hey, what do you guys say
we take this party on the road?

06:20.172 --> 06:21.423
Fine by me.

06:21.507 --> 06:22.841
Skinemax doesn't kick in
with the really dirty stuff

06:22.925 --> 06:24.301
till about 3:00 anyway.

06:24.384 --> 06:28.013
They had one on last night
where the girl had a buttface

06:28.096 --> 06:30.390
but her breasts
was immaculate.

06:34.228 --> 06:37.147
Peter, you sure it's okay to be
at the brewery after hours?

06:37.231 --> 06:39.191
Relax, Joe, this
is where I work.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.360
Besides, it sure beats the
hell out of last Saturday

06:41.443 --> 06:44.196
when we partied with that
big-horned guy from Legend.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.447
Hey, you guys want
to go to IHOP?

06:45.531 --> 06:46.573
Get some breakfast
or something?

06:46.657 --> 06:48.575
Oh, God, I don't know,
Big-Horned Guy.

06:48.659 --> 06:49.993
It's like 3:00 a.m.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.662
Oh, that sucks, man,
I'm wide awake.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.706
-Hey, Quagmire, you want to...
-Oh! Oh!

06:54.790 --> 06:55.874
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.209
I'm sorry, man.
Are you okay?

06:57.292 --> 06:58.293
-No!
-I didn't see him.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.045
Aah!

07:00.128 --> 07:01.672
(all laughing)

07:01.755 --> 07:03.340
Okay, okay, guys,
here's one.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.552
If you were God, who would
you strike down first?

07:06.635 --> 07:09.054
Debra Messing.
I find her insufferable.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.389
French Stewart.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.266
What are you
squinting about?

07:12.349 --> 07:14.101
It's not even
that bright.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.310
Yeah, he's terrible.

07:15.394 --> 07:17.521
What we need out there
now is another Tim Daly.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.940
-Who's Tim Daly? I don't even know
-who that is.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.650
From Wings?
Nope.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.026
Tim Daly. He
was on Wings.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.570
What, no-nobody
here watched Wings?

07:24.653 --> 07:26.697
Is that the one where there's
a guy and he's like, uh,

07:26.780 --> 07:27.781
he's a, he's a pilot
or something?

07:27.865 --> 07:29.199
There's two guys.

07:29.283 --> 07:30.492
They're brothers and
they're both pilots.

07:30.576 --> 07:32.995
And wasn't there a fat guy
with a mustache?

07:33.078 --> 07:34.955
That was Roy.
He's hilarious.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.415
Was this a cartoon?

07:36.498 --> 07:37.958
No, my, oh,
my god, no!

07:38.041 --> 07:39.543
No, no, it took
place in an airport.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.420
Th-Th-The thing was
on for ten years.

07:41.503 --> 07:44.298
The, and the, and the funny
repair guy was Lowell.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.133
It made Tony
Shalhoub's career.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.759
Who?
The tennis player?

07:47.843 --> 07:49.136
God, you know what?
Screw you guys.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.138
I don't even
know you.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.222
Crazy people.

07:52.306 --> 07:55.058
Living under a rock,
don't know Wings.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.560
I love Wings!

07:59.938 --> 08:01.732
All right, I want to be
very clear about this.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.775
You can meet her, chat for
a minute, and that's it.

08:03.859 --> 08:05.402
In and out.
Oh, don't worry, Brian.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.070
If she's as ugly
as I think she is,

08:07.154 --> 08:08.405
I'll look at her once
and then I'll go...

08:08.488 --> 08:10.824
(makes vomiting noises)

08:10.908 --> 08:12.242
...all over the place.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.494
Then you'll wipe it up
and then we'll go.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.079
Hi, Brian.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.164
Oh, my God.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.498
Who's your cute
little friend?

08:18.624 --> 08:19.625
Oh, my.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.418
Hello. Stewie.
Charmed.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.503
I'm Jillian.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.171
Come on in.
Who wants a drink?

08:27.174 --> 08:28.842
So, you gonna take
back what you said?

08:28.926 --> 08:30.260
Brian, she's stunning.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.929
Okay, you met her,
you can scram now.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.305
I shall do
no such thing.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.182
Now, why in the world
would you be embarrassed

08:35.265 --> 08:36.266
about dating her?

08:36.350 --> 08:37.684
Oh, my God, Brian.

08:37.768 --> 08:41.522
I was watching something on TV
about this guy named Hitler.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.565
Somebody should stop him.

08:44.149 --> 08:46.193
Are her parents
brother and sister?

08:46.276 --> 08:47.486
Can you please
leave now?

08:47.569 --> 08:49.821
Oh... now I get it.

08:49.905 --> 08:51.281
She's a moron.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.867
But a moron with large breasts
you can use as mountains

08:53.951 --> 08:55.202
for your Matchbox cars,

08:55.285 --> 08:57.204
or whatever it is grown-ups
do with large breasts.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.330
Shut up, that's
not it at all.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.624
Say, Jillian, I love what
you've done with the place.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.501
What is it?
One bedroom, one bath?

09:02.584 --> 09:04.920
No, it's a whole apartment.

09:05.003 --> 09:08.131
Oh, God, outstanding.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.550
So, Stewie.

09:09.633 --> 09:12.261
Do you work with Brian
at the detective agency?

09:12.344 --> 09:14.596
Why, yes,
as a matter of fact, I do.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.348
At the detective agency.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.684
That's got to be a tough job.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.894
I know Brian's work
has him coming and going

09:20.978 --> 09:22.521
at all hours of the night.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.147
I bet it does,
I bet it does.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.649
Okay, well, Stewie
has to go now.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.984
What are you
talking about?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.111
I want some more of
Jillian's delicious lemonade.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.904
I know,
it's good, right?

09:30.988 --> 09:32.656
I just wish
they didn't have to kill

09:32.739 --> 09:34.616
so many lemons
to make it.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.702
Oh, this is fun, eh?

09:36.785 --> 09:37.828
(groans)

09:42.374 --> 09:46.461
So, wait, Dupree moves in with
Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon?

09:46.545 --> 09:48.714
But they're newlyweds, right?

09:48.797 --> 09:50.966
Well, that's no time
to have a houseguest.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.050
Oh, gotta go.

09:52.134 --> 09:53.343
Sorry, Angela.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.387
Every Tuesday morning,
I call my friend Cleveland

09:55.470 --> 09:58.182
and he describes every scene
from You, Me, and Dupree.

09:58.307 --> 09:59.558
Griffin, your work
output this week

09:59.641 --> 10:01.018
is even worse
than usual.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.644
Where the hell are
those purchase orders?

10:02.728 --> 10:03.896
Eh, it's this bum hand.

10:03.979 --> 10:04.980
I can't type with it.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.523
Well, that's
not my problem.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.901
-I need to see some improvement by the
-end of the week

10:08.984 --> 10:10.027
or you're finished.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.945
Don't worry,
I'll figure something out.

10:12.029 --> 10:14.406
(phone rings) Oh, that's going to be
Quagmire with Along Came Polly.

10:14.489 --> 10:15.741
I gotta take that.

10:15.824 --> 10:18.202
All right, so as you know
by this point in the story,

10:18.285 --> 10:20.204
Ben Stiller doesn't
like spicy food.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.706
Well, guess
what's for dinner?

10:22.789 --> 10:24.958
No way.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.004
Boy, Lois,
thanks so much for coming in

10:29.087 --> 10:30.380
and helping me
get my work done.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.466
Without you, Angela would
have been all over my case.

10:32.549 --> 10:33.967
Oh, it's all
right, Peter.

10:34.051 --> 10:36.261
I know it's tough for you to
work with your hand injury.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.388
Hey, you know, uh, with you
sitting there, it's, uh,

10:38.472 --> 10:40.057
it's kind of like
you're my secretary.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.476
Well, let's not get
carried away, Peter.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.311
Now, please, I'm trying
to finish your work.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.646
You know, Lois,
if I'm your boss,

10:45.729 --> 10:47.147
I gotta look like a boss.

10:47.231 --> 10:50.067
Finally, I have a reason to
wear this big bowtie and cigar

10:50.150 --> 10:52.569
I bought at the
Dress For Success store.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.571
Peter, if you want this
work to get done...

10:54.655 --> 10:56.198
Lois, take a letter.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.450
"Dear Life Cereal,

10:58.534 --> 11:00.619
"Where do you get off?

11:00.702 --> 11:03.914
"Part of a balanced breakfast
and delicious?

11:03.997 --> 11:06.124
"Who do you think you are?

11:06.208 --> 11:09.044
"By now, you may have guessed
I'm speaking ironically

11:09.127 --> 11:10.295
"and have nothing
but good things

11:10.379 --> 11:12.297
"to say about what you do.

11:12.381 --> 11:15.676
"Life Cereal,
do not change a thing.

11:15.759 --> 11:16.844
"Signed, Peter Griffin.

11:16.927 --> 11:17.928
Dictated but not read."

11:18.011 --> 11:19.263
Lois, read that back to me.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.810
Oh, hey, Brian.
Back from a hot booty call

11:24.893 --> 11:26.144
with your idiot
girlfriend?

11:26.228 --> 11:27.646
You know,
th-think what you want,

11:27.729 --> 11:29.857
but you don't see the side
of Jillian that I do.

11:29.940 --> 11:33.068
Face it, Brian, she's dumber
than a Boston-area book report.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.362
The novel I chose to address

11:35.445 --> 11:38.782
is Oliver Twist
by Charles Dickens.

11:38.866 --> 11:39.950
Queer name, right?

11:40.033 --> 11:42.619
The book was actually not bad.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.872
For your information,
Jillian is very bright

11:44.955 --> 11:47.124
and she happens to be
a very talented photographer.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.542
Oh, that is so lame.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.627
Every hot girl who
can aim a camera

11:50.711 --> 11:52.087
thinks she's
a photographer.

11:52.171 --> 11:54.756
Ooh, you took a black-and-white
picture of a lawn chair

11:54.840 --> 11:57.134
and its shadow
and developed it at Sav-On.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.635
You must be so brooding
and deep.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.596
Knock it off.
No, I want to know, Brian.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.389
What, specifically,
do you talk about?

12:02.472 --> 12:03.599
Uh, a lot of things.

12:03.682 --> 12:06.351
Um, food, um...

12:06.435 --> 12:09.021
the new seat covers
she just got for her Jetta.

12:09.104 --> 12:12.774
Um... Real World/
Road Rules Challenge.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.359
You hate MTV.

12:14.443 --> 12:15.819
Pot helps.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.321
Look, you know,
I don't have to justify

12:17.404 --> 12:18.488
anything to you,
all right?

12:18.572 --> 12:20.199
All that matters
is Jillian and I

12:20.282 --> 12:21.366
have a great time together.

12:21.450 --> 12:23.118
We make each other laugh.
Fine.

12:23.202 --> 12:24.661
But just tell me
this, Brian:

12:24.745 --> 12:26.246
does she laugh
on her own

12:26.330 --> 12:29.583
or does she laugh
only when you laugh?

12:29.666 --> 12:31.210
I thought so.

12:31.293 --> 12:33.045
(cell phone rings "Axel F")

12:34.880 --> 12:37.257
Hey. Yeah.

12:37.341 --> 12:39.092
Uh-huh... uh-huh.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.804
Uh, you gotta hit,
uh, DVD and then menu

12:42.888 --> 12:44.890
and then select. Yeah.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.434
Yeah, the DVD needs
to be face up

12:47.518 --> 12:49.061
when you put it in.

12:49.144 --> 12:50.729
Uh-huh.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.106
You should be able
to see the words Mr. 3000.

12:53.190 --> 12:56.151
Yeah... still nothing?

12:56.235 --> 12:57.569
Is it plugged in?

12:57.653 --> 12:59.530
Okay, so plug it in.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.907
Okay. Y-You got it?

13:01.990 --> 13:03.909
Is it-- uh, okay.
All right.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.786
No, no problem.
All right.

13:05.911 --> 13:07.829
Uh, love you, too,
Jilly bean.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.623
Okay.
(hangs up phone)

13:09.706 --> 13:11.250
-What? Nothing. I didn't
-say anything.

13:11.375 --> 13:13.001
(sighs):
I need a drink.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.005
(altered voice):
Uh, hey, uh, Jilly bean?

13:17.089 --> 13:18.715
Hey, it's Brian again.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.051
Uh, so, yeah, um, so I figured

13:21.134 --> 13:23.512
we could get together
tonight and maybe, um,

13:23.595 --> 13:26.640
do all those things sexually
that we usually do.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.809
Um, what were those again?

13:30.185 --> 13:31.645
No way, gross!

13:31.728 --> 13:32.980
Oh, I mean, I mean,
oh, oh, no.

13:33.063 --> 13:35.232
Yeah, I totally love
how that feels.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.364
Hi.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.491
You know, I've been
noticing you

13:44.575 --> 13:46.869
around the steno pool.

13:46.952 --> 13:49.162
You look good enough
for a promotion.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.747
Peter, cut it out.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.458
Hey, that's no way
to talk to your boss.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.003
(sniffs):
Mmm, is that Pert?

13:56.086 --> 13:57.421
You know it is.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.423
Smell my Speed Stick?

13:59.506 --> 14:00.924
(sighs)

14:03.635 --> 14:05.137
Peter, what the hell
are you doing?

14:05.220 --> 14:06.847
Lois, I'm gonna come
right out with it.

14:06.972 --> 14:09.099
I think it would be
so hot for you and me

14:09.183 --> 14:10.517
to have sex in my office.

14:10.642 --> 14:11.894
Oh, my God.

14:12.019 --> 14:14.062
There is no way that
is gonna happen.

14:14.146 --> 14:15.981
You know, it's no wonder
you're so far behind

14:16.064 --> 14:18.358
-in your work if this is how you behave
-at the office.

14:18.442 --> 14:20.360
Come on, just touch it.
Touch yours.

14:20.444 --> 14:22.446
Peter, no. I
have work to do

14:22.529 --> 14:23.864
so you can
keep your job.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.073
Oh, look at me, I'm Lois.

14:25.157 --> 14:27.034
I'm a worker.
I make stuff on things.

14:27.117 --> 14:28.368
Oh, I'll file these later.

14:28.452 --> 14:30.120
Oh, I got a phone--
nope, that's it.

14:30.204 --> 14:31.580
Geez, Lois,
I thought having you here

14:31.663 --> 14:32.998
was gonna be fun, but so far

14:33.081 --> 14:35.709
you're a bigger buzzkill
than Buzz Killington.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.127
(laughing)

14:37.211 --> 14:39.796
Oh, man, this is the best
party I've ever been to.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.173
(laughs)

14:41.256 --> 14:42.674
Evening, everyone.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.760
I thought it would
be very droll

14:44.843 --> 14:47.763
if we all sat down
and looked at etchings.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.473
Would you like
to join me, Peter?

14:49.556 --> 14:52.059
Uh, well, we-we're
kinda partying here.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.394
Good! Hold this up.

14:54.478 --> 14:58.398
Now here's a fellow
attempting to ride a bicycle.

14:58.482 --> 15:00.984
But he's having some
trouble, isn't he?

15:01.068 --> 15:02.569
Would you like to know why?

15:02.653 --> 15:04.738
(sighs):
Why?

15:04.821 --> 15:06.198
Because he's a Scot!

15:06.281 --> 15:08.700
(chuckles)

15:08.825 --> 15:10.869
Now, who here likes

15:10.994 --> 15:13.664
a good story about a bridge?

15:13.830 --> 15:15.541
Ahh!

15:18.043 --> 15:19.294
What the hell?

15:19.378 --> 15:21.380
Jillian, what...
what are you doing here?

15:21.463 --> 15:22.798
Oh, hi, Brian.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.091
It was so nice
of you to invite

15:24.174 --> 15:25.467
your girlfriend
over for dinner.

15:25.551 --> 15:27.052
I invited her for dinner?

15:27.135 --> 15:29.596
Yes, you did. You wanted
her to meet the family.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.014
Now, come here, Brian.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.641
Come sit by your friend, Stewie.

15:32.724 --> 15:35.018
And then, think
about this:

15:35.143 --> 15:37.771
have you ever seen
the sun and the moon

15:37.896 --> 15:39.898
in the same place
at the same time?

15:39.982 --> 15:42.568
(gasps):
They're the same person!

15:42.651 --> 15:43.819
I know, right?!

15:43.902 --> 15:45.237
You're brilliant!

15:45.320 --> 15:47.447
Hey, Oogie!

15:48.073 --> 15:50.200
So tell us, Oogie,

15:50.284 --> 15:51.994
where'd you find
this one, huh?

15:52.077 --> 15:53.996
You two meet at
a Mensa meeting?

15:54.079 --> 15:56.331
No, at a Quizno's.

15:56.415 --> 15:59.626
-We both ordered the Turkey Ranch
-and Swiss, no onions.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.128
Can you believe that?

16:01.253 --> 16:03.088
(sarcastically):
No, wow.

16:03.172 --> 16:04.423
What are the odds?

16:04.506 --> 16:06.466
Well, hey, what are the odds
of finding true love

16:06.550 --> 16:08.844
anywhere in the world
says this observer.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.430
Hey, you wanna
know something cool?

16:11.513 --> 16:13.348
I threw up a lot
in high school,

16:13.432 --> 16:15.350
so I don't get
my period anymore.

16:15.434 --> 16:16.935
Wow, this is the
one you've been

16:17.019 --> 16:18.729
waiting for,
huh, Brian?

16:18.812 --> 16:20.397
(laughing)

16:20.522 --> 16:22.149
Are you serious?

16:22.232 --> 16:24.193
Are you serious, Brian?

16:24.276 --> 16:25.861
All right, you know
what, Lois, don't judge.

16:25.944 --> 16:27.112
Because you don't
know what two people

16:27.196 --> 16:28.197
are like when
they're alone.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.741
Come on. Let's
go out dancing.

16:30.824 --> 16:33.368
I don't know, I'm feeling
kinda cozy tonight. Kinda mellow.

16:33.452 --> 16:35.412
I just really want
to go dancing--

16:35.495 --> 16:37.623
(gasps):
There it is again!

16:37.706 --> 16:39.333
What is that?

16:44.213 --> 16:45.881
So, Jillian, what
are your views

16:45.964 --> 16:47.382
regarding homeland
security?

16:47.508 --> 16:49.968
-Do you think we should support what
-the president is doing?

16:50.093 --> 16:52.930
Well, I just think,
for starters,

16:53.013 --> 16:54.932
that sometimes
the government has things

16:55.015 --> 16:58.018
they can't tell us
and, truthishly,

16:58.101 --> 16:59.311
we should just
accept that.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.188
Okay, good-night,
everyone. Oh, say, Jillian,

17:01.271 --> 17:03.357
before you go. I forget.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.734
Do you know what the capital
of this state is?

17:05.817 --> 17:07.861
Um... Rhode Island City?
(door slams)

17:07.945 --> 17:09.571
(laughs)

17:09.655 --> 17:12.157
It's like she's (bleep) five!

17:18.038 --> 17:20.541
Thanks for hanging out
with my friends, Brian.

17:20.624 --> 17:22.918
Hey, come on. We're-we're
a legitimate couple, right?

17:23.001 --> 17:24.586
I-I should be able to
talk with your friends.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.505
So then the valet
pulls up and I'm all,

17:26.588 --> 17:28.507
"That is so not my car."

17:28.590 --> 17:30.425
But then it totally was.

17:30.509 --> 17:32.386
That's happened
to me!

17:32.469 --> 17:34.805
Me, too.
Cars go fast.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.015
(laughs):
Oh, God.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.642
Yeah, I tell ya,
if I had a nickel

17:38.725 --> 17:40.352
for every time
that happened.

17:40.519 --> 17:42.187
Yeah...?
What?

17:42.521 --> 17:43.939
What if you had a nickel

17:44.022 --> 17:45.440
for every time
that happened?

17:45.524 --> 17:48.026
-No, nothing. It's just an expression.
-A what?

17:48.110 --> 17:50.737
Well, I-I was just saying I-I do
my share of dopey stuff.

17:50.821 --> 17:53.031
Like, oh, this... this one time

17:53.115 --> 17:56.201
I attended a speaker's
colloquium on federal judgeships

17:56.285 --> 17:58.203
and without realizing it,
I kept calling

17:58.287 --> 18:00.497
William Rehnquist
"William Rhinequist."

18:00.581 --> 18:02.207
(laughs):
Come on.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.001
I mean, how-- doi.

18:06.044 --> 18:08.005
-Anyone else have to go to the little
-girls' room?

18:08.088 --> 18:09.089
I have new gloss!

18:09.256 --> 18:10.549
I love gloss!
Oh, that rocks!

18:10.632 --> 18:11.633
Gloss rhymes with hair!

18:11.717 --> 18:13.135
(sighs)

18:13.218 --> 18:15.554
STEWIE:
Dude, that was painful.

18:15.679 --> 18:17.431
What are you doing here?
Did you follow us?

18:17.556 --> 18:19.349
Brian, why can't
you just admit

18:19.433 --> 18:20.726
what's going on here?

18:20.809 --> 18:22.644
-(sighs): Okay, okay.
-Fine. Fine.

18:22.728 --> 18:23.937
I'm gonna have
to break it off.

18:24.021 --> 18:26.023
But, boy, it's gonna be
tougher than the reviews

18:26.106 --> 18:27.441
for Our American Cousin.

18:27.566 --> 18:30.194
Blah, blah, blah,
"Lincoln assassinated,"

18:30.277 --> 18:32.279
blah, blah, blah,
"tragedy for our Republic."

18:32.362 --> 18:33.739
Uh... oh, look!

18:33.906 --> 18:36.283
"Ably performed
by the entire ensemble."

18:36.366 --> 18:38.493
OTHER ACTORS:
That's us! That's all of us!

18:40.162 --> 18:42.247
Morning, Lois, I need
you to proofread this

18:42.331 --> 18:43.707
and collate it for me.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.584
Peter, did you
Xerox your penis?

18:45.667 --> 18:47.461
300 times. It's
a flip book.

18:47.586 --> 18:49.171
Flip through it
or you're fired.

18:49.254 --> 18:51.924
Oh, my God!
This is disgusting.

18:52.007 --> 18:53.050
Peter, for the last time,

18:53.133 --> 18:55.177
I'm not having sex
with you in this office.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.262
Why the hell are you
pushing this so hard?

18:57.346 --> 18:59.181
Because, Lois, I already
wrote the letter

18:59.264 --> 19:01.808
to "Penthouse Forum,"
and I don't wanna be made a liar

19:01.892 --> 19:03.101
in the nudie magazine of record.

19:03.227 --> 19:04.686
(sighs):
All right.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.980
If I give you
30 seconds of making out,

19:07.105 --> 19:08.148
will that shut you up?

19:08.232 --> 19:09.566
Let's see where it goes.

19:09.650 --> 19:11.068
(sighs)

19:11.151 --> 19:13.695
(both moan)

19:19.368 --> 19:21.745
Oh, God, you know
this is pretty hot.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.497
Yeah, what'd I
tell you, huh?

19:23.580 --> 19:25.332
(both moan)

19:25.457 --> 19:27.668
Oh, God, Peter,
let's do it.

19:27.793 --> 19:29.920
Let's do it
right here, right now!

19:30.003 --> 19:31.505
Lois, Lois wait. Wait.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.465
Opie's right there.

19:33.882 --> 19:36.218
I want him
to look, Peter.

19:36.385 --> 19:38.720
(shouting gibberish)

19:43.851 --> 19:45.602
Well, that is
the last of it.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.688
You are now all caught
up with your work.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.815
Lois, I really
appreciate you

19:49.898 --> 19:51.942
helping me out this week,
and I really appreciate

19:52.025 --> 19:53.402
you having sex
with me in my office.

19:53.527 --> 19:56.697
Well, that was my
pleasure, too, Peter.

19:56.780 --> 19:58.282
Haa, I knew I'd get you.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.492
Just like Danny DeVito
got Rhea Perlman.

20:00.659 --> 20:01.743
I don't know, Danny.

20:01.827 --> 20:04.788
-Look, it's either me or nobody.
-Sold.

20:06.957 --> 20:08.166
All right, Brian,
you can do this.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.169
You can dump her.
Because once it's done,

20:10.252 --> 20:11.920
never again will you
have to listen to her

20:12.004 --> 20:13.088
talk like this?

20:13.213 --> 20:14.339
You know, where
everything has

20:14.423 --> 20:15.591
a question mark
at the end of it?

20:15.674 --> 20:17.259
With an upward inflection?

20:17.426 --> 20:18.886
At the end
of every sentence?

20:19.011 --> 20:20.762
Yeah, I don't know
what I was thinking?

20:20.888 --> 20:22.681
Oh, damn it. Now
I'm doing it, too.

20:24.975 --> 20:26.977
Oh, hey, Oogie.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.520
Ooh, you look tense.

20:28.604 --> 20:30.022
Well, uh, Jillian,

20:30.105 --> 20:32.191
there's something we
need to talk about.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.775
What is it?

20:33.859 --> 20:35.611
I, uh...

20:35.694 --> 20:37.696
just wanted to spend
some time with you.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.117
(mumbles)

20:42.201 --> 20:43.535
What the hell?
It took you

20:43.619 --> 20:44.953
three hours
to break up with her?

20:45.037 --> 20:46.663
Uh, not exactly.

20:46.747 --> 20:48.081
Well, what were you
doing in there?

20:48.165 --> 20:49.625
(sniffs):
What's that smell?

20:49.708 --> 20:52.794
-It smells like sweat and anger and shame.
-Yep.

20:52.878 --> 20:54.087
STEWIE:
Life's confusing

20:54.171 --> 20:55.672
when you grow up,
isn't it, Brian?

20:55.756 --> 20:57.758
-It is. Can we play my
-mix tape?

20:57.841 --> 20:58.842
Yeah, go ahead.

20:58.926 --> 21:01.303
(Gary Numan's "Cars" begins)

21:01.386 --> 21:04.598
Brian had sex
with a really dumb girl

21:04.681 --> 21:06.725
Now he's taking
his friend Stewie

21:06.808 --> 21:09.561
To get some ice cream
in his car...

21:09.645 --> 21:10.938
(turns off music)
Oh, you're a poor sport.
