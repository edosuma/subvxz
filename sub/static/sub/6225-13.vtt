00:01.710 --> 00:05.089
DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.173 --> 00:10.303
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.386 --> 00:13.014
His name, Merlin.

00:15.266 --> 00:17.643
(ALL SCREAMING)

00:20.313 --> 00:23.399
| know you are tired,
but make one last effort for me.

00:23.983 --> 00:26.277
Every shot must count!

00:35.745 --> 00:38.122
GUINEVERE: I don't think people
can suffer a third night of this.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.958
-You must trust in Arthur.
- I do,

00:41.042 --> 00:42.668
but even he has little chance.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.757
I'm sorry you're
having to do this.

00:48.758 --> 00:50.593
Why? You're not to blame.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.890
(ROARING IN DISTANCE)

01:02.980 --> 01:04.022
Flame up!

01:10.655 --> 01:12.031
Stay strong!

01:12.531 --> 01:15.493
For tonight is not your night to die,
I'll make sure of that.

01:22.792 --> 01:24.293
Hold firm!

01:29.507 --> 01:30.841
Hold!

01:32.343 --> 01:33.594
Hold!

01:37.807 --> 01:39.141
Now!

02:22.059 --> 02:23.561
-We've no clean water left.
- I know,

02:23.644 --> 02:25.438
| know, but it's too dangerous
to go out there.

02:28.733 --> 02:30.234
Gwen, don't!

02:30.776 --> 02:32.570
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

02:42.580 --> 02:44.248
(PANTING)

02:48.252 --> 02:49.670
Clear the square!

02:56.302 --> 02:57.470
Gwen!

03:02.350 --> 03:03.851
Guinevere!

03:17.865 --> 03:20.117
(ARTHUR GROANS)

03:41.639 --> 03:42.640
(CHANTING)

03:49.647 --> 03:53.859
Do not imagine
that your petty magic can harm me!

03:56.821 --> 03:58.823
Why are you doing this?

03:59.824 --> 04:01.575
You're killing
innocent people!

04:12.753 --> 04:14.839
You shouldn't have
risked your life.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.384
| wasn't going to let anything
happen to you.

04:19.385 --> 04:20.928
(CHUCKLES)

04:39.196 --> 04:40.489
(PANTING)

04:40.573 --> 04:42.283
-Are you hurt?
-There's nothing I can do.

04:44.034 --> 04:47.163
My magic is no good.
It doesn't work.

04:47.246 --> 04:51.333
Dragons aren't monsters,
they're creatures of wonder and magic.

04:51.417 --> 04:54.044
You must realize
that they are immune to your powers.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.088
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

05:00.885 --> 05:03.762
The dead number,
49 men, 27 women,

05:03.888 --> 05:06.807
a further 18 women and children
are unaccounted for.

05:07.099 --> 05:10.311
Most of last night's fires
are now out. The castle walls,

05:11.812 --> 05:14.440
in particular the Western section,
are near to collapse. I could go on.

05:14.523 --> 05:17.026
Do we have any further idea
on how the beast escaped?

05:17.109 --> 05:19.403
| regret to say,
Sire, we don't.

05:22.239 --> 05:26.035
UTHER: There must be some way
to rid ourselves of this aberration.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.043
Gaius?

05:37.588 --> 05:40.007
We need a Dragonlord, Sire.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.759
You know very well
that is not an option.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.135
GAIUS: Sire, what if...

05:44.094 --> 05:46.639
There was indeed
one last Dragonlord left?

05:46.764 --> 05:48.933
-That's not possible.
-But if there was?

05:56.607 --> 05:57.650
What are you saying?

05:58.609 --> 05:59.777
It may be just rumor.

05:59.902 --> 06:02.112
-Go on.
-I'm not exactly sure,

06:02.238 --> 06:06.492
but I think his
name is Balinor.

06:07.993 --> 06:10.037
-Balinor.
-ARTHUR: Where does he live?

06:10.120 --> 06:11.997
He was last seen
in Cenred's kingdom.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.666
In the border town of Engerd.

06:13.791 --> 06:15.125
But that was many years ago.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.880
If this man still exists,
then it is our duty to find him.

06:19.964 --> 06:22.841
Our treaty with Cenred
no longer holds. We are at war.

06:23.759 --> 06:26.512
If you're discovered beyond
our border, they would Kill you.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.973
| will go alone.
That way ['ll not be detected.

06:29.098 --> 06:31.850
-No, Arthur, it's too dangerous.
-More dangerous than staying here?

06:32.685 --> 06:35.604
I'm not standing by and watching my men
die when I have the chance to save them.

06:35.688 --> 06:36.981
| have given you my orders.

06:39.692 --> 06:41.110
Do not make this
a test of wills, Father.

06:41.193 --> 06:43.654
I'm not talking to you as a father,
I'm talking to you as a King!

06:48.826 --> 06:50.035
| will ride immediately.

06:51.495 --> 06:53.747
-My concern is for you.
-Mine is for Camelot.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.710
| will send word
when I have found him.

07:00.504 --> 07:02.339
Prepare the horses.

07:06.885 --> 07:09.013
Who were the Dragonlords?

07:11.640 --> 07:12.850
Gaius?

07:17.354 --> 07:21.734
There were once men who could
talk to the dragons, tame them.

07:22.026 --> 07:23.193
What happened to them?

07:24.570 --> 07:28.240
Uther believed that the art of
the Dragonlord was too close to magic,

07:28.824 --> 07:32.328
so he had them all rounded up
and slaughtered.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.916
But one survived.

07:39.835 --> 07:42.212
-How did you know?
- Ihelped him escape.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.883
Gaius! (LAUGHS)

07:49.678 --> 07:53.098
Merlin, you've never heard
the name Balinor?

07:53.557 --> 07:54.642
No.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.478
Your mother
never mentioned him?

07:58.187 --> 07:59.563
My mother?

08:01.398 --> 08:04.401
-She took him in.
-She stood up against Uther?

08:04.526 --> 08:07.071
-Yes. Yes.
-She was brave.

08:07.571 --> 08:10.199
When Uther discovered
where Balinor was,

08:10.282 --> 08:12.910
he sent knights to Ealdor
to hunt him down.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.204
He was forced to flee.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.248
Why didn't my mother tell me
any of this?

08:19.875 --> 08:24.630
Merlin, I promised her I would
never speak of these things.

08:24.755 --> 08:28.592
-Of what?
-I've always treated you as my son,

08:30.636 --> 08:33.138
but that is not what you are.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.101
The man you are
going to look for

08:37.893 --> 08:39.770
is your father.

08:51.532 --> 08:52.950
My father?

08:54.201 --> 08:55.452
Yes.

08:58.122 --> 08:59.581
He was a Dragonlord?

09:04.420 --> 09:05.796
Why did no one ever tell me?

09:05.921 --> 09:06.964
| wanted to.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.133
Your mother feared
it would be too dangerous.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.259
| had a right to know.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.470
-She wanted to protect you.
-No.

09:15.431 --> 09:17.474
| had a right to know.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.318
Have you got
everything you need?

09:31.155 --> 09:34.783
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- I know that.

09:35.743 --> 09:38.328
-Come on, Merlin!
-You're ready?

09:38.912 --> 09:40.664
No thanks to you.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.128
-Are you okay?
-It's just a scratch.

09:53.260 --> 09:57.931
Merlin, whatever happens, you must not
let Arthur know who this man is.

09:58.015 --> 10:01.143
Uther would view the son of
a Dragonlord with the deepest suspicion.

10:24.041 --> 10:27.711
This is it. One more step,
and we're in Cenred's Kingdom.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.049
This Balinor
better be worth it.

10:40.724 --> 10:42.309
(LAUGHING)

10:55.989 --> 10:57.366
Greetings!

11:05.582 --> 11:06.583
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

11:07.501 --> 11:09.086
We're looking
for a man named Balinor.

11:10.921 --> 11:14.591
I'm willing to pay handsomely.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.019
Never heard of him.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.441
You think one of these men
is Balinor?

11:31.525 --> 11:32.901
| hope not.

11:33.777 --> 11:34.778
So do |I.

11:43.287 --> 11:45.622
-What is wrong with you today?
-What?

11:45.706 --> 11:48.292
It pains me to admit it,
but I do enjoy your surly retorts.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.711
In fact, it's probably
your only redeemable feature.

11:51.628 --> 11:52.671
Thanks.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.548
There are loads of servants
who can serve,

11:55.299 --> 11:59.553
but so few are capable of making
a complete prat of themselves.

12:02.556 --> 12:03.807
-What is it?
-Nothing.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.767
It's something. Tell me.

12:11.273 --> 12:15.569
All right, I know I'm a prince,
so we can't be friends,

12:17.112 --> 12:18.822
-but if wasn't a prince.
-What?

12:19.156 --> 12:20.908
Well, then...

12:21.825 --> 12:23.243
| think we'd probably get on.

12:24.828 --> 12:27.289
-So?
-So that means you can tell me.

12:27.998 --> 12:29.917
That's true,
but if you weren't a prince,

12:30.000 --> 12:31.460
I'd tell you to mind
your own damn business.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.794
Merlin!

12:35.672 --> 12:38.926
-Are you missing Gaius?
-Something like that.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.929
Well, what is it then?

12:42.012 --> 12:44.473
(SIGHS) I'll tell you.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.357
I'm worried about
everyone back in Camelot.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.608
| hope they're all right.

12:57.486 --> 12:58.779
So do |I.

13:07.663 --> 13:08.956
Hold!

13:10.374 --> 13:11.625
Hold!

13:14.127 --> 13:15.337
Hold!

13:18.966 --> 13:20.217
Now!

13:33.647 --> 13:35.399
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

14:17.899 --> 14:19.484
(MAN PANTING)

14:19.609 --> 14:20.610
What's going on?

14:20.736 --> 14:22.195
Do you know what the
punishment is for theft?

14:22.279 --> 14:24.031
Please, I've got children to feed.

14:24.114 --> 14:25.824
Tell me where to find Balinor.

14:26.825 --> 14:27.909
Balinor?

14:27.993 --> 14:30.454
-What do you know of him?
-Nothing, I...

14:31.788 --> 14:35.250
-Do you value your life?
-It's been many years since I saw him.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.793
Do you know where he lives?

14:40.255 --> 14:42.424
You must travel
through the forest of Merendra,

14:42.507 --> 14:44.634
to the foot of
Feorre mountain.

14:45.427 --> 14:48.263
There you will find the cave
where Balinor dwells.

14:55.479 --> 14:57.647
-But don't get your hopes up.
-Why?

14:58.273 --> 15:02.402
He will not welcome you.
Balinor hates everyone and everything.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.281
A cave's the best place for him.

15:18.043 --> 15:21.546
-It's all right.
-It's the wound. Let me have a look.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.385
Get down. Get down.

15:30.514 --> 15:32.641
(ARTHUR BREATHING HEAVILY)

15:46.238 --> 15:47.656
Arthur.

16:26.570 --> 16:27.737
Hello?

16:51.386 --> 16:52.554
(CHOKES)

16:52.637 --> 16:56.099
-What do you want here, boy?
-My friend is sick. He needs help.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.487
Show me, boy.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.160
What are you waiting for?
Fetch him!

17:38.266 --> 17:40.310
(CHANTING)

17:51.321 --> 17:52.530
He needs rest.

17:54.366 --> 17:57.869
-Will he be all right?
-By morning.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.668
Thank you.

18:16.471 --> 18:17.514
Looks good.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.523
-How long have you lived here?
-A few winters.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.234
-Must be hard.
-Why are you here?

18:30.527 --> 18:31.903
Just traveling.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.451
We're looking for someone.

18:42.205 --> 18:45.542
| was told... Well, they said
that he lived somewhere here abouts.

18:46.835 --> 18:50.171
A man named Balinor.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.722
You've never heard of him?

19:02.892 --> 19:05.228
-He was a Dragonlord.
-He's passed on.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.398
-You knew him?
-Who are you?

19:09.899 --> 19:11.526
I'm...

19:13.737 --> 19:14.738
Merlin.

19:16.740 --> 19:17.741
And him?

19:21.119 --> 19:22.579
-He's my master.
-His name?

19:23.455 --> 19:25.749
His name is Lancelot.

19:25.874 --> 19:29.252
He's a knight,
but a nice one.

19:30.712 --> 19:34.341
His name is Arthur Pendragon.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.428
-He is Uther's son.
-Yes.

19:38.553 --> 19:42.098
This is Cenred's kingdom.
He's asking for trouble.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.434
What do you want from me?

19:46.978 --> 19:48.521
Are you Balinor?

19:53.943 --> 19:56.654
The Great Dragon
is attacking Camelot.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.951
-His name is Kilgharrah.
-We can't stop him.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.079
Only you, a Dragonlord, can.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.082
He does not act blindly.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.752
He Kills for a reason,
vengeance.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.921
This is of Uther's making.

20:13.004 --> 20:14.589
He's killing innocent people.
Women and children.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.424
Uther pursued me!

20:16.508 --> 20:19.427
-He hunted me like an animal!
-I know.

20:19.511 --> 20:21.930
What do you know
about anybody's life, boy?

20:25.308 --> 20:28.269
Uther asked me to use my power to bring
the last dragon to Camelot.

20:28.353 --> 20:31.815
He said he wanted to make peace with it,
but he did not.

20:31.940 --> 20:34.275
He lied to me. He betrayed me.

20:35.443 --> 20:38.279
-You want me to protect this man?
-I want you to protect Camelot.

20:38.363 --> 20:40.782
He killed every
one of my kind,

20:41.491 --> 20:42.700
| alone escaped.

20:43.827 --> 20:44.828
Where did you go?

20:48.665 --> 20:50.959
There is a place called Ealdor.

20:52.127 --> 20:53.169
Yes.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.506
| had a life there.

20:58.508 --> 20:59.843
A woman.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.514
A good woman.

21:05.515 --> 21:09.310
Ealdor is beyond Uther's realm,
but still he pursued me.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.856
Why would he not let me be?

21:13.815 --> 21:15.316
What was it that I had done

21:15.400 --> 21:19.904
that he wanted to destroy the life
I'd built, abandon the woman I loved?

21:20.029 --> 21:22.031
He sent knights to kill me.

| was forced to
come here, to this.

21:26.578 --> 21:27.662
So...

21:29.038 --> 21:30.957
| understand how
Kilgharrah feels.

21:33.084 --> 21:35.837
He's lost every one of his kind,
everyone of his kin.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.883
You want to know
how that feels?

21:42.677 --> 21:44.387
Look around, boy.

21:47.098 --> 21:48.558
Let Uther die.

21:50.852 --> 21:52.562
Let Camelot fall.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.903
-You want everyone in Camelot to die?
-Why should I care?

22:00.778 --> 22:03.281
-What if one of them was your son?
- I don't have a son.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.453
-And if I told you...
-ARTHUR: Merlin.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.459
Merlin. (COUGHING)

22:35.438 --> 22:37.565
| feel great!

22:37.732 --> 22:39.442
What the hell did you give me?

22:40.777 --> 22:42.946
It was all down to Balinor.

22:44.614 --> 22:47.283
So we've found him, then.
Thank heaven for that.

22:49.452 --> 22:51.913
-Doesn't mean he's willing to help.
-What?

22:52.956 --> 22:56.584
-You won't persuade him.
-Does he know what's at stake?

22:59.963 --> 23:02.590
-What kind of a man is he?
-I don't know.

23:04.926 --> 23:06.761
| thought he'd
be something more.

23:08.805 --> 23:10.306
(INAUDIBLE)

23:42.505 --> 23:44.507
Are you missing Morgana?

23:47.176 --> 23:49.470
She's stronger
than people think.

23:49.554 --> 23:51.973
| believe that wherever she is,
she'll be all right.

23:54.350 --> 23:58.021
-And Arthur?
-You care a lot for him, don't you?

23:59.355 --> 24:00.690
Everyone does.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.321
| think he cares
the same way about you.

24:10.533 --> 24:13.411
It's all right,
| won't tell anyone.

24:15.747 --> 24:16.914
| know it can never be.

24:18.708 --> 24:22.170
Well, the world's a strange place,
Guinevere.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.215
Never underestimate
the power of love.

24:28.009 --> 24:30.386
I've seen it
change many things.

24:39.187 --> 24:42.357
-What did he say?
-He'll change his mind.

24:42.440 --> 24:45.234
-He said that?
-Just give him a moment.

24:58.539 --> 24:59.582
Farewell, then.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.128
That's your decision?

25:06.381 --> 25:08.758
| will not help Uther.

25:11.969 --> 25:13.763
Then the people of Camelot
are damned!

25:14.138 --> 25:16.766
-So be it.
-Have you no conscience?

25:19.769 --> 25:23.106
You should ask that question
of your father.

25:23.606 --> 25:24.774
And you are no
better than him.

25:29.278 --> 25:31.114
Don't waste your time, Merlin.

25:37.412 --> 25:40.456
Gaius spoke of
the nobility of Dragonlords,

25:40.581 --> 25:41.708
clearly he was wrong.

25:46.421 --> 25:48.297
-Gaius?
-Yes.

25:50.675 --> 25:53.344
-A good man.
-Yeah.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.767
-I was hoping you'd be like him.
-ARTHUR: Merlin!

26:03.813 --> 26:05.314
-I wanted...
-ARTHUR: Merlin!

26:10.820 --> 26:12.822
Well, there's no point.

26:30.214 --> 26:32.884
| always thought that silence
would be a blessing with you,

26:33.009 --> 26:34.802
but I find it
just as irritating.

26:35.595 --> 26:36.637
You're a riddle, Merlin.

26:38.181 --> 26:39.724
-A riddle?
-Yes.

26:40.725 --> 26:43.519
-But I've got to quite like you.
-Yeah?

26:43.644 --> 26:46.355
Now I realize you're not
as big a fool as you look.

26:47.857 --> 26:49.817
Yeah. I feel the same.

26:51.027 --> 26:54.280
Now that I realize
you're not as arrogant as you sound.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.532
-You still think I'm arrogant?
-No.

26:57.200 --> 27:00.328
More supercilious.

27:01.329 --> 27:03.039
That's a big word, Merlin.

27:03.748 --> 27:06.250
-You sure you know what it means?
-Condescending.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.752
-Very good.
-Patronizing.

27:07.877 --> 27:09.879
-Doesn't mean that.
-No, these are other things you are.

27:10.379 --> 27:11.547
-Hang on.
-(TWIG SNAPS)

27:11.672 --> 27:13.424
-Overbearing.
-Shh!

27:13.549 --> 27:14.967
Very overbearing.

27:15.051 --> 27:17.428
-Merlin!
-But you wanted me to talk.

27:19.347 --> 27:20.723
(TWIGS SNAPPING)

27:32.068 --> 27:33.069
Careful, boy.

27:34.570 --> 27:35.905
| thought you
might need some help.

27:37.198 --> 27:41.118
-This is dangerous country.
-Will you return to Camelot with us?

27:43.079 --> 27:44.997
You were right, Merlin.

27:45.081 --> 27:47.792
There are some in Camelot
who risked their lives for me.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.087
| owe a debt
that must be repaid.

27:52.547 --> 27:55.341
If you succeed in killing the dragon,
you will not go unrewarded.

27:55.424 --> 27:58.636
(CHUCKLES) I seek no reward.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.974
Great. Let's eat.

28:11.649 --> 28:13.442
-This wood's too wet.
-Don't worry.

28:13.818 --> 28:15.778
I'm sure we'll find a way
to make it light.

28:22.827 --> 28:27.290
When you healed Arthur,
| heard you mumble some words.

28:27.957 --> 28:29.041
An ancient prayer.

28:30.126 --> 28:32.253
| thought it might have been
more than that.

28:33.421 --> 28:35.464
The Old Religion
can teach us many things.

28:35.798 --> 28:38.509
The Old Religion?
Is that something you were taught?

28:39.468 --> 28:41.512
It is not something you can learn.

28:42.805 --> 28:45.391
Either it's a part of you,
or it isn't.

28:45.474 --> 28:48.811
(SIGHS) My father knew that,
and his father before him.

28:50.313 --> 28:51.439
Were they also Dragonlords?

28:55.026 --> 28:56.777
We'll need some kindling.

28:59.155 --> 29:00.823
You mentioned...

29:02.033 --> 29:03.826
You spoke of Ealdor.

29:05.995 --> 29:07.330
You took refuge with a woman.

29:08.664 --> 29:09.832
That was a long time ago.

29:10.207 --> 29:11.876
| grew up there.

29:13.878 --> 29:15.171
-Ealdor?
-Yes.

29:17.006 --> 29:20.176
-I know the woman.
-Hunith?

29:22.637 --> 29:24.847
-She's still alive?
-Yes.

29:26.724 --> 29:28.017
She's my mother.

29:30.645 --> 29:31.979
Then she married.

29:34.857 --> 29:35.900
That's good.

29:36.859 --> 29:37.860
She never married.

29:43.366 --> 29:44.659
I'm your son.

29:59.048 --> 30:00.549
| don't know what it is
to have a son.

30:04.095 --> 30:05.680
Or I a father.

30:12.061 --> 30:14.105
You must not tell Arthur.

30:59.817 --> 31:00.901
(BLOWING)

31:05.948 --> 31:08.075
Why did you never return?

31:10.453 --> 31:12.163
| thought her life
would be better without me.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.752
-Why?
-Uther wanted me dead.

31:19.754 --> 31:23.466
If he'd found me,
he'd have killed me and your mother.

31:26.969 --> 31:28.471
| wanted her to be safe.

31:32.850 --> 31:34.435
We could've come with you.

31:36.479 --> 31:39.356
What kind of life
would you have had here?

31:41.150 --> 31:44.987
We'd have been happy.

31:58.501 --> 32:00.836
When we've
finished in Camelot,

32:03.464 --> 32:04.965
| will take you to Ealdor.

32:08.219 --> 32:09.637
She won't recognize me.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.229
| see her in you.

32:23.234 --> 32:24.360
Yeah?

32:24.985 --> 32:26.362
You have her kindness.

32:32.868 --> 32:34.078
How did you
become a Dragonlord?

32:36.914 --> 32:38.874
You don't choose
to become a Dragonlord.

32:39.250 --> 32:43.045
It's not something you're taught.
It's a sacred gift.

32:45.047 --> 32:49.051
For thousands of years it's been
handed down from father to son.

32:51.887 --> 32:54.765
And that is what
you must now become, Merlin.

32:58.227 --> 32:59.270
| would like that.

33:02.022 --> 33:06.068
Like all Dragonlords, you won't know
for sure that you have that power

33:07.236 --> 33:09.905
until you face
your first dragon.

33:21.959 --> 33:23.085
You should get some sleep.

33:24.753 --> 33:26.547
We've a big day ahead of us.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.470
Good night, Son.

33:43.105 --> 33:44.940
Sleep well, Father.

34:06.921 --> 34:08.922
-Mmm!
-Cenred's men!

-Please! No. Please.

35:33.215 --> 35:35.384
-I can save you.
-Listen to me.

35:35.509 --> 35:39.763
When you face the dragon,
remember, be strong.

35:39.888 --> 35:44.184
A dragon's heart
is on its right side, not its left.

35:44.268 --> 35:46.937
-(CRYING) I can't do it alone.
-Listen to me.

to know you will make me proud.

No. Father...

36:15.299 --> 36:16.425
No.

36:21.263 --> 36:22.431

The last Dragonlord is dead.

There were many years when
| might've wished for that news.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.890
All is not lost, Father.

37:48.976 --> 37:51.437
We have to
fight the monster ourselves.

37:51.520 --> 37:55.357
So let us ride out
and fight on our own terms.

37:55.482 --> 37:58.235
On open ground, on horseback,

37:58.360 --> 37:59.528
where we can maneuver better.

37:59.653 --> 38:01.738
-There is no point.
-So what?

38:03.699 --> 38:07.161
We stand here and
watch Camelot fall?

38:17.045 --> 38:18.547
You have my blessing.

not wish to fight, can do so

38:31.059 --> 38:32.895
without stain on
their character.

38:33.270 --> 38:35.898
For those brave
enough to volunteer should know,

38:37.774 --> 38:39.860
that the chances of returning
are slim.

39:43.632 --> 39:45.259
Merlin, what happened?

39:45.801 --> 39:47.928
| couldn't save him.

39:49.304 --> 39:50.305
Merlin.

39:53.308 --> 39:56.270
He said the Dragonlord's gift
is passed from father to son.

That is true.

faced the Great Dragon,

40:07.155 --> 40:08.365

to stand up to him?

40:29.469 --> 40:31.179
Only time will tell.

40:40.814 --> 40:41.940
Look on the bright side, Merlin.

40:42.024 --> 40:44.192
Chances are you're not gonna
have to clean this again.

40:44.526 --> 40:45.861
You must be careful today.

40:46.862 --> 40:48.488
Do not force the battle.

-Yes, Sire.
-I'm serious.

At least you've got your
sense of humor back.

Are you really going to face
this dragon with me?

47:53.788 --> 47:55.999
-He's gone?
-Yeah.

47:59.294 --> 48:01.504
You did it. (LAUGHS)

48:01.588 --> 48:03.631
(LAUGHING)

48:13.224 --> 48:14.642
You did it.

48:58.228 --> 48:59.938
| thought I'd lost you.

49:07.070 --> 49:08.321
My boy.

49:13.118 --> 49:15.495
| felt him there with me, Gaius.

49:15.578 --> 49:16.788
He'll always be with you.

49:17.831 --> 49:19.207
| hope so.

49:19.833 --> 49:22.252
Merlin, I know I can never compare
with your father,

49:23.545 --> 49:27.340
but for what it's worth,
you've still got me.

49:31.678 --> 49:33.346
Well... (CHUCKLES)

49:33.513 --> 49:34.848
| suppose I'll just have
to make do.

49:35.056 --> 49:36.683
(LAUGHING)

49:42.689 --> 49:44.482
DRAGON: Merlin.
