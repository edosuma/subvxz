WEBVTT

00:13.930 --> 00:14.931
Meow.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.267
[whistling]

00:17.517 --> 00:18.852
[theme music playing]

00:47.005 --> 00:50.842
[Douxie] Now then, now then!
Gather around, milords and ladies!

00:51.342 --> 00:54.137
Test your luck with the Lad o' Fortune!

00:55.096 --> 00:57.682
Now, remember,
keep your eye on the prize!

00:58.057 --> 01:01.019
Find the ball to win it all!
Find the ball and win it--

01:01.102 --> 01:02.812
-[man] Hey!
-[Douxie] Oh, hello.

01:02.937 --> 01:04.981
-I will give it a go!
-[coin clatters]

01:05.106 --> 01:07.442
Keep your eye on the cup.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.569
Easy pickin's, eh?

01:09.652 --> 01:11.112
Ha! Eh...?

01:11.654 --> 01:12.489
[Douxie] Nah-ah-ah-ah.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.157
Please, your knightliness.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.993
-Only one pick per play!
-[coin rings]

01:17.243 --> 01:18.453
-[rattles]
-[gasps] What?

01:18.536 --> 01:20.163
Eh! Hmm...!

01:20.246 --> 01:21.539
[murmurs]

01:21.956 --> 01:22.791
-[Archie yowls]
-Agh!

01:22.874 --> 01:24.501
-[Archie] Oh, no!
-Magic!

01:24.584 --> 01:25.752
[Douxie] <i>Gassus flotulous!</i>

01:25.835 --> 01:27.962
[knight] Argh! Get him!

01:28.505 --> 01:30.757
[knight grunting]

01:32.467 --> 01:33.760
-[blades ring]
-[whimpers]

01:34.093 --> 01:36.221
[knight] You may not know,
but by order of the King,

01:36.304 --> 01:38.223
use of magic has been outlawed--

01:38.306 --> 01:41.434
under penalty of instant death.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.853
[moans] Oh... fuzzbuckets.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.190
[blades clang]

01:47.273 --> 01:48.107
[Douxie] Oh...!

01:48.191 --> 01:50.735
-[Archie] Douxie! What did you do?
-That wasn't me!

01:50.819 --> 01:52.195
-[faint ringing]
-Eh...?

01:54.114 --> 01:56.032
Merlin Ambrosius!

01:56.658 --> 01:58.993
Thank you! I owe you my life!

01:59.327 --> 02:02.080
And what sort of life would that be?

02:02.163 --> 02:03.873
Have you ever asked yourself that?

02:04.332 --> 02:08.294
Your ruse with the smoke spell
<i>was</i> rather clever.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.838
-Really?
-No.

02:10.296 --> 02:12.090
But it was real magic.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.759
Come. You could use a hot meal,

02:14.843 --> 02:16.845
and I could use a new apprentice.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.263
What? Me?

02:18.847 --> 02:19.889
-What?
-[knight] What happened?

02:20.098 --> 02:23.685
Look at us, Arch,
teaming up with the magnanimous Merlin!

02:23.768 --> 02:25.270
I knew this plan wasn't a mistake.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.856
A wizard does not make mistakes,

02:27.939 --> 02:31.025
he makes unexpected possibilities.

02:44.539 --> 02:45.957
[purrs]

02:46.291 --> 02:48.918
It's all gone. Everything.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.962
The Heart of Avalon, Camelot...

02:52.255 --> 02:53.423
[taps] Merlin.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.140
Maybe we should say a few words...?

03:02.223 --> 03:04.350
Yeah, okay. Ahem.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.020
Battleship. November.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.606
Fruit punch. [sobs]

03:10.398 --> 03:13.151
Purple--! [sobbing]

03:15.111 --> 03:17.113
Oh, what can I say about Merlin?

03:17.864 --> 03:20.742
[Douxie] He was... he was, uh...

03:20.867 --> 03:22.869
[sniffling]

03:23.244 --> 03:24.996
He was everything.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.206
He was all that we had.

03:28.625 --> 03:29.500
[grunts]

03:30.084 --> 03:32.420
We'll get through this, together.

03:32.503 --> 03:35.381
We need you, Doux, now more than ever.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.927
The world, our friends are in danger.

03:39.010 --> 03:42.347
And the Order's about to kick off
an arcane apocalypse.

03:42.430 --> 03:43.765
Merlin didn't tell me anything.

03:44.015 --> 03:47.060
And of course, he gave us a book
that I can't even read.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.146
[Douxie] I mean, what is that
supposed to be? Orcish? Elvish?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.272
Naga snake tribe?

03:51.356 --> 03:52.357
[gasps]

03:53.191 --> 03:55.735
It looks like... ancient Draconic.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.154
Draconic? [gasps] Dracula!

03:58.238 --> 04:01.407
-[Steve] Oh, no, Dracula!
-No... as in dragons.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.369
-As in...
-Charlemagne, the Devourer.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.080
Charlemagne, the Devourer.

04:07.163 --> 04:10.416
Keeper of the most sacred stones
and treasures. A vicious dragon.

04:10.541 --> 04:12.460
Which is why we shouldn't trouble him.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.170
[Archie] Maybe someone else can translate.

04:14.379 --> 04:17.632
Come on, Arch!
This is clearly about the Genesis Seals.

04:17.715 --> 04:19.008
And if the Order finds them first--

04:19.342 --> 04:20.677
Yes, yes, yes, we're all doomed.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.471
I suppose we'll have to pay
Charlemagne a visit.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.849
[whirring]

04:27.809 --> 04:30.270
What about Jim? I need to find him.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.230
Go back to Hex Tech.

04:32.313 --> 04:34.315
Research any dark magic
that could help him.

04:34.482 --> 04:35.900
Okay. Let's go, Steve.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.695
Aw--! But the dragon quest!

04:39.028 --> 04:40.905
What're you going to do,
get eaten again?

04:40.989 --> 04:42.031
[Steve yelps]

04:47.912 --> 04:48.746
[grunts]

04:48.830 --> 04:51.958
Well, let's hope we get some answers...
before the Order does.

05:07.807 --> 05:08.766
[sniffs]

05:08.850 --> 05:12.228
This reliquary reeks of Merlin.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.399
[yells] Nari, show yourself!

05:17.317 --> 05:18.526
Hmm...

05:19.610 --> 05:24.407
-I thought you set this place ablaze.
-Merlin's magic is powerful.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.200
-Was.
-[Jim snarls]

05:28.286 --> 05:30.621
Raze the foundations!

05:30.705 --> 05:32.457
[Bellroc] Find the Seals!

05:32.790 --> 05:36.878
[Bellroc]
Leave his allies no place to hide!

05:37.545 --> 05:38.963
[crashing]

05:39.047 --> 05:39.922
[Jim growls]

05:43.051 --> 05:45.386
[sighs] Simpler times.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.388
You were naive.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.725
Yes. Yes. Thank you for that insight.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.311
-[clattering]
-Arthur...

05:53.394 --> 05:55.772
you spent your life fighting magic,

05:55.855 --> 05:59.650
but now you serve demigods
who seek to destroy everything.

05:59.734 --> 06:02.028
You killed Merlin with no remorse.

06:02.111 --> 06:04.113
Where is <i>my</i> Arthur?

06:04.197 --> 06:07.241
He stands here-- reborn.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.870
Your mind is taken...
like the Trollhunter's.

06:11.454 --> 06:14.999
You brought me back
to free you of your chains.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.502
Watch your words, sister.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.880
What are you planning, witch?

06:20.963 --> 06:23.132
Nothing. Not anymore.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.467
[yells]

06:25.134 --> 06:27.845
This was the last
of Merlin's places of power.

06:28.679 --> 06:31.849
-Unless you know of any others, Morgana?
-No.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.143
He wisely hid much from me.

06:34.393 --> 06:37.230
Perhaps I'll search the shadows for them.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.027
[Bellroc yells]

06:45.071 --> 06:46.906
[Skrael] You realize that's pointless.

06:46.989 --> 06:50.576
Fire is calming, Skrael.
It helps me think.

06:51.994 --> 06:54.956
[distant alarm blares]

06:55.039 --> 06:56.040
[dog barking]

06:58.417 --> 07:02.380
-I can't believe Merlin's gone.
-And Master Jim--

07:02.463 --> 07:07.093
trapped in the body of a loathsome beast
by Arthur's corruption.

07:07.176 --> 07:11.430
I sense all living souls, small and great.

07:13.057 --> 07:16.060
And I felt Merlin's leave this plane.

07:17.186 --> 07:20.022
Nari, if you can feel all souls,

07:20.106 --> 07:21.149
what about Jim's?

07:21.232 --> 07:22.984
[gasps] I will try.

07:41.210 --> 07:44.297
My roots extend across the Earth.

07:45.756 --> 07:48.926
But I cannot find the soul of your friend.

07:49.343 --> 07:52.555
So, all that's left of Jimbo
is that <i>beast</i>?

07:52.638 --> 07:53.848
I won't accept that.

07:54.140 --> 07:57.810
If we can't find his soul in <i>this</i> world,
I'll find it in another.

07:58.227 --> 08:01.230
-I'm going into the Shadow Realm.
-Claire, you mustn't!

08:01.314 --> 08:04.442
With Morgana back,
that dimension is no longer safe.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.904
I can't abandon him.
Jim was turned by dark magic.

08:08.112 --> 08:09.739
So, I'll save him with my own.

08:09.822 --> 08:10.823
[rumbles]

08:11.157 --> 08:12.200
Good luck! [chuckles]

08:12.658 --> 08:15.953
-[Toby] Bring Jimbo back.
-Please... fair Claire.

08:21.000 --> 08:21.834
[branches crunch]

08:22.210 --> 08:23.044
[grunts]

08:23.127 --> 08:26.339
You've told me tales of Charlemagne,
the Devourer, for centuries.

08:26.422 --> 08:28.966
The truth may be stranger than fiction.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.261
[Douxie] Oh... I've heard terrible tales--

08:32.345 --> 08:35.806
whoever stole his treasure
got baked alive into a blood pie.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.227
[Archie] And burned, and singed.
Oh, here we are.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.772
I really don't want to be a blood pie.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.565
[grunts]

08:44.690 --> 08:45.525
How do we get ther--

08:45.608 --> 08:46.817
[yells]

08:47.777 --> 08:48.611
Oh, no!

08:48.986 --> 08:50.821
[wails, grunts]

08:51.489 --> 08:53.032
Ugh! All this...

08:53.407 --> 08:56.327
ugh-- for a book.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.454
[panting]

08:58.829 --> 09:00.915
[staff whirrs, rings]

09:02.500 --> 09:04.085
[panting]

09:07.838 --> 09:08.714
Agh!

09:10.633 --> 09:12.510
Oh, fuzzbuckets.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.096
-[faint growl]
-[gasps]

09:16.472 --> 09:17.598
-[louder growl]
-[gasps]

09:18.516 --> 09:20.476
-[rumbles]
-[gasps]

09:20.560 --> 09:23.187
I do <i>not</i> want to be baked
into a blood pie!

09:26.691 --> 09:28.025
[stomps]

09:28.109 --> 09:30.403
[Douxie whines] Oh... fuzzbuckets.

09:30.861 --> 09:34.198
Look what the cat dragged in.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.828
[whining]

09:39.078 --> 09:40.913
[stomping]

09:42.081 --> 09:42.915
Get it?

09:42.999 --> 09:45.126
"Cat drag-in"!

09:45.585 --> 09:47.545
It's a play on words!

09:47.628 --> 09:50.881
[laughing] I slay myself!

09:51.882 --> 09:55.845
Archie? My cuddly little shapeshifter.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.848
-Come here.
-Oh, Father!

09:58.931 --> 10:01.475
When did you get so big?

10:01.934 --> 10:02.810
Very funny, yes.

10:02.893 --> 10:05.896
You don't see me talking about
all those gray scales, do you?

10:05.980 --> 10:06.814
-[chuckling]
-[Douxie] What?

10:07.189 --> 10:10.776
Charlemagne, the Devourer,
is your <i>father</i>?

10:10.985 --> 10:13.779
Dad, this is my dear friend, Douxie.

10:13.863 --> 10:19.118
So, I finally get to meet
your wizard familiar.

10:19.368 --> 10:20.620
Mm!

10:20.786 --> 10:25.041
Pleased to make your acquaintance,
Mr. Charlemagne, the Devourer.

10:25.124 --> 10:29.253
Please. My friends call me "Charlie."

10:29.754 --> 10:32.965
Let's retire to my dragon's den.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.053
I'm sure Archibald told you

10:37.136 --> 10:41.641
all about my famous blood-berry pies.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.393
"Blood-berry"?
There's no time for tea!

10:44.477 --> 10:47.521
The Arcane Order is back.
They-- [sighs]

10:47.605 --> 10:49.482
[Archie] Killed Merlin.

10:50.149 --> 10:53.152
Merlin's... dead?

10:53.235 --> 10:56.072
So, you're after the Seals, hmm?

10:56.947 --> 11:00.326
And we think <i>this</i>
will tell us how to find them.

11:00.826 --> 11:01.661
Hmm.

11:04.246 --> 11:08.584
Of course. He never wrote anything
in large print.

11:09.210 --> 11:12.421
Mm. Ancient Draconic.

11:13.005 --> 11:16.050
[Charlie murmurs, gasps]

11:16.550 --> 11:20.054
The first letter is an "H."

11:20.388 --> 11:21.764
Aw, come on!

11:21.847 --> 11:24.475
We don't have forever!
The world's at stake here!

11:24.558 --> 11:27.103
I'll need my reading glasses.

11:27.186 --> 11:30.648
Be back in two shakes of a wyvern's tail.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.900
Where did I put those things?

11:34.777 --> 11:36.987
-Oh, a "real monster," eh?
-[lapping]

11:37.321 --> 11:40.324
You think you're the only one
with father issues, hmm?

11:46.997 --> 11:48.833
Jim, where are you?

11:51.252 --> 11:52.586
[gasps]

11:57.716 --> 11:58.634
Uh--!

12:00.261 --> 12:01.429
[Morgana] Handmaiden!

12:01.679 --> 12:03.097
[Claire] You here for a fight?

12:04.974 --> 12:07.309
Whatever the Order's planning,
I <i>won't</i> let you win!

12:07.393 --> 12:09.645
[grunts] I'm not here for the Order!

12:09.770 --> 12:11.480
-[grunts]
-[Claire] I don't believe it!

12:11.564 --> 12:13.315
You're always up to something.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.776
I don't have time
to quarrel with you, child!

12:15.860 --> 12:17.945
I'm here to save my brother. [gasps]

12:20.489 --> 12:24.493
[Morgana] I must know
if <i>my</i> Arthur still exists.

12:24.660 --> 12:28.372
You want to save your brother.
I want to save Jim.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.042
[Claire] Truce?
We'll hold off killing each other

12:32.126 --> 12:35.504
until after we find
Jim <i>and</i> Arthur's souls.

12:35.588 --> 12:40.259
Wise. I always said
we're more alike than you know.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.302
[Claire] Perhaps.

12:41.677 --> 12:42.928
[Charlie] Oh, where are the...?

12:43.012 --> 12:45.848
Archie, why did you make your dad
sound like a terrifying beast?

12:45.931 --> 12:48.976
-[Charlie] They're here somewhere!
-Truthfully, I was embarrassed.

12:49.059 --> 12:51.270
Dad's a walking pun factory.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.606
The legends seemed better than the truth.

12:53.689 --> 12:56.317
Then again, compared to Merlin, who was...

12:56.400 --> 12:59.361
-Not the type to make tea and biscuits.
-[Archie] Yes.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.614
And now that he's, well, gone,

13:02.072 --> 13:05.618
I'm more worried about you.
You know you can talk to me, right?

13:05.701 --> 13:06.535
[Douxie sighs]

13:06.744 --> 13:08.454
I can't help but think...

13:08.537 --> 13:10.789
what if Merlin was more like Charlie?

13:10.873 --> 13:13.417
If he hadn't saved me in that alley,

13:13.501 --> 13:16.253
[sighs] would I be
a completely different wizard?

13:16.420 --> 13:19.882
We don't get to choose everyone
that comes into our lives.

13:20.424 --> 13:21.800
Or when they leave.

13:23.427 --> 13:25.513
[purring]

13:25.804 --> 13:28.015
Ta-da! Would you believe

13:28.098 --> 13:30.976
-they were on my head the whole time?
-[Douxie sighs]

13:31.143 --> 13:34.480
-Please. Just tell me what it says.
-[Charlie] Mm.

13:34.772 --> 13:40.069
"Hisirdoux, if anyone
could figure this out, it'd be you..."

13:40.236 --> 13:44.573
[Merlin's voice] <i>Since you're</i>
<i>reading this, clearly, I'm dead.</i>

13:44.657 --> 13:47.535
<i>I kept many secrets close at hand,</i>

13:47.618 --> 13:52.706
<i>but now I entrust you with this,</i>
<i>my final one.</i>

13:53.123 --> 13:56.210
<i>The Genesis Seals can be reached...</i>
[voice fades]

13:56.293 --> 13:59.171
[Charlie] "...by destroying my staff."

13:59.255 --> 14:01.382
What? Wait, destroy his staff?

14:01.465 --> 14:03.759
There's no time to waste, my boy.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.970
You've got a world to save!

14:06.053 --> 14:08.305
A wizard's staff is everything to them.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.308
Look, are you sure
that you translated it correctly?

14:11.392 --> 14:12.226
-Uh! [panting]
-Dad!

14:12.643 --> 14:13.477
[growls]

14:13.769 --> 14:17.273
-Wait! Don't rush me!
-Douxie, Dad, play nice!

14:17.356 --> 14:20.776
Careful, boy. You're playing with fire.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.071
[Claire] Wait.

14:25.364 --> 14:26.740
I can feel him.

14:29.451 --> 14:30.286
[Claire] There!

14:32.079 --> 14:34.790
The Bridge. It binds his human soul,

14:34.874 --> 14:37.835
his inner torment,
manifested from the physical realm--

14:37.918 --> 14:40.421
I know. You did this to me once.

14:40.504 --> 14:43.215
Ah, yes. We had fun.

14:45.843 --> 14:46.844
-Jim?
-[blade scrapes]

14:46.927 --> 14:49.513
[Jim] A Trollhunter answers every call...

14:51.056 --> 14:54.101
Jim, I know there's still
a piece of you in there.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.562
[Jim] I must protect my friends...

14:56.645 --> 15:00.608
from Bular, Gunmar, the Green Knight.

15:00.691 --> 15:03.485
-Jim, please.
-He's too far gone.

15:05.237 --> 15:08.782
Remember our first date?
Or that night after the dance?

15:08.866 --> 15:11.744
We've been through so much together.

15:12.286 --> 15:15.205
I am so sorry.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.291
For so long I felt guilty

15:17.374 --> 15:19.710
that I wasn't strong enough
to save you in the woods.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.922
But I've fought across time and space
to bring you back.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.424
It can't all have been for nothing.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.802
I'll always love you.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.681
Claire? You found me.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.016
[gasps]

15:34.808 --> 15:35.768
Agh!

15:36.352 --> 15:37.186
[groans]

15:37.770 --> 15:39.355
-[Claire] Unh!
-[growling]

15:39.438 --> 15:41.690
Jim! Fight it, Jim!

15:41.774 --> 15:43.317
[Jim howls]

15:43.984 --> 15:46.111
Claire? Help me!

15:46.320 --> 15:47.613
Don't give up!

15:47.696 --> 15:50.240
We're going to make it
through this, together!

15:50.407 --> 15:52.368
[moans] Agh!

15:53.535 --> 15:55.079
-[Jim roars]
-[Claire gasps]

15:55.162 --> 15:56.872
[Jim snarls]

15:56.956 --> 15:57.957
[Claire screams]

15:59.959 --> 16:00.960
[growls]

16:02.628 --> 16:03.796
[grunts]

16:05.464 --> 16:06.757
[Jim roars]

16:08.300 --> 16:10.761
-We cannot stay here.
-Jim was in there.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.680
Which means I can save him!

16:12.972 --> 16:15.891
If there's hope for him,
there's hope for my brother.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.309
And myself.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.813
[panting]

16:20.896 --> 16:21.897
Oh, dear.

16:22.189 --> 16:24.525
Never challenge a dragon.

16:24.608 --> 16:25.901
[growls]

16:26.068 --> 16:29.363
Father, Hisirdoux, I miss him, too.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.408
But you know,
Merlin's not the only family you had.

16:32.866 --> 16:34.034
[clicks]

16:34.910 --> 16:35.911
[sighs]

16:37.246 --> 16:38.539
[Charlie] He's right.

16:38.747 --> 16:41.458
Family isn't only who you have.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.711
It's also who you're with.

16:45.462 --> 16:46.422
[clattering]

16:46.505 --> 16:48.757
Did you know, Archibald used to be

16:48.841 --> 16:51.802
the cutest little dragon you've ever seen?

16:51.885 --> 16:54.263
[gasps] Father, please!

16:54.346 --> 16:55.264
Burn that!

16:55.347 --> 16:58.559
Archie always wanted to explore the world,

16:59.018 --> 17:01.520
even before he took his first form.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.231
[Charlie] And when he chose a cat,

17:04.314 --> 17:07.317
-[grunts]
-that broke my dragon heart.

17:07.651 --> 17:10.070
He became a familiar--

17:10.154 --> 17:12.322
a lower profession.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.491
But if a cat is what he wants,

17:14.575 --> 17:17.161
-a cat is fine with me.
-[purring]

17:17.244 --> 17:20.247
[Charlie] I realized I had to let him go,

17:20.330 --> 17:23.584
so he could spread his wings and soar.

17:23.834 --> 17:27.504
-And accepting that set me free.
-[sighs]

17:27.588 --> 17:29.673
And r-r-right now,

17:29.757 --> 17:31.675
your people look to you--

17:31.759 --> 17:34.511
to stand up, to lead.

17:34.970 --> 17:35.846
[puffs]

17:39.767 --> 17:42.019
I know you're still grieving.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.314
[Charlie] I know this is too much.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.151
[Charlie] But in order to save
your family--

17:49.234 --> 17:51.570
to save the world--

17:51.653 --> 17:54.740
-you must let him go.
-[gasps]

18:02.331 --> 18:04.625
Do it. Destroy it.

18:07.377 --> 18:09.296
[groans]

18:09.880 --> 18:12.466
[crackling]

18:12.716 --> 18:14.051
[Douxie wails]

18:14.468 --> 18:15.636
[clattering]

18:16.970 --> 18:17.846
[Archie] Douxie!

18:20.808 --> 18:22.643
[panting]

18:28.857 --> 18:31.151
[footsteps tapping]

18:34.238 --> 18:38.534
[Merlin's voice] <i>It was real magic.</i>
<i>And I could use a new apprentice.</i>

18:40.536 --> 18:42.204
<i>Carry on, and don't...</i>

18:42.412 --> 18:44.915
-But, master--
-[Merlin's voice]<i> ..."But, master" me.</i>

18:44.998 --> 18:47.126
<i>-Hisirdoux, change...</i>
-[gasps]

18:47.209 --> 18:49.211
<i>-Magic is master...</i>
<i>-Hisirdoux...</i>

18:49.294 --> 18:51.922
[voices overlapping]

18:53.674 --> 18:56.301
<i>Hisirdoux, what have you done?</i>

18:56.385 --> 18:59.096
<i>A wizard does not make mistakes.</i>

19:00.013 --> 19:03.100
<i>He makes unexpected possibilities.</i>

19:08.981 --> 19:10.816
You weren't perfect, old man...

19:11.400 --> 19:12.526
but at least you tried.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.530
[Merlin's voice]<i> The greatest thing</i>
<i>I have ever accomplished</i>

19:16.613 --> 19:17.906
<i>was saving you.</i>

19:19.616 --> 19:21.201
Goodbye, master.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.662
-[rattling]
-Huh...?

19:24.955 --> 19:26.373
[creaking]

19:33.547 --> 19:36.633
I'll find a way
to protect this world, master.

19:36.717 --> 19:37.968
My way.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.053
[Charlie gasps]

19:42.389 --> 19:43.307
[panting]

19:43.432 --> 19:45.684
Mordrax's miracles, you found them!

19:45.767 --> 19:47.519
Well done!

19:47.603 --> 19:50.105
I knew you'd do it, little buddy!

19:51.982 --> 19:53.400
The Genesis Seals!

20:03.118 --> 20:04.453
[man's voice echoes] <i>Guinevere!</i>

20:14.046 --> 20:15.214
[rustling]

20:17.466 --> 20:18.550
-Guinevere!
-Brother--!

20:18.717 --> 20:20.219
-[screeching]
-[grunts]

20:20.761 --> 20:24.556
You're trapped in your loss.
Your Guinevere is gone!

20:25.849 --> 20:27.059
[screams]

20:27.559 --> 20:28.393
[roars]

20:28.477 --> 20:32.105
-Guinevere!
-Please! Rest. Be at peace.

20:32.606 --> 20:37.069
Sister, how can I be at peace
when the world is still broken?

20:37.277 --> 20:39.780
You hear me? Your mind is clear!

20:39.863 --> 20:42.282
Yes. Clearer than ever.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.243
Then I can free you. We can escape.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.286
No. The Arthur you knew

20:46.370 --> 20:48.997
committed too many sins to count.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.668
He awoke to a legacy
of a violent, awful world.

20:53.043 --> 20:53.919
[grunts]

20:54.544 --> 20:58.924
I see now the only path to redemption
is the Order's--

20:59.007 --> 21:03.553
to wipe the world clean and begin again.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.097
No, no.

21:05.180 --> 21:07.933
I fought for magic's freedom,
not destruction.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.851
Why did you resurrect me?

21:09.935 --> 21:12.437
[Arthur] To destroy Merlin.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.148
To stand by my side and watch

21:15.232 --> 21:18.068
as the Order ushers in the new dawn.

21:18.151 --> 21:19.778
No! No!

21:22.864 --> 21:23.782
[grunts]

21:25.534 --> 21:28.412
Brother, what has become of us?

21:29.538 --> 21:30.706
Hmm...

21:31.456 --> 21:32.291
[Claire] Morgana!

21:35.168 --> 21:38.505
[Claire] Come on!
We have to get outta here! [grunting]

21:43.760 --> 21:44.970
[buzzing]

21:46.179 --> 21:47.264
[sighs]

21:51.810 --> 21:53.145
Hmm...

21:53.603 --> 21:54.896
[Toby whines]

21:54.980 --> 21:57.190
Come on, Claire. Come on...

21:57.316 --> 21:58.734
[rumbling]

22:03.405 --> 22:04.281
[gasps] Claire!

22:05.866 --> 22:07.826
[screams] Evil lady!

22:07.909 --> 22:10.370
-[Krel] Great Gaylen!
-Queen of darkness!

22:10.454 --> 22:12.039
Compatriots, to arms!

22:12.622 --> 22:14.791
Stop! You've got it wrong!

22:14.875 --> 22:16.793
[Claire] She's not the enemy!

22:16.877 --> 22:17.836
-[building groans]
-[group yelps]

22:18.837 --> 22:20.172
They followed me.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.345
[all gasp]

22:26.428 --> 22:27.929
[screams]

22:29.014 --> 22:31.892
[music playing]
