WEBVTT

00:12.888 --> 00:14.931
- I gotta go.
- No, no. He'll be here.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.808
I'm sure he's just running
a little late.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.601
He's canceled two exams.
He's not gonna...

00:18.727 --> 00:20.019
He's scared of you.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.354
Sure.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.189
The ex-boy toy.
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:23.315 --> 00:24.982
- He wasn't scared before.
- Right.

00:25.109 --> 00:27.819
You think being afraid of me is
a symptom of a serious ailment?

00:27.945 --> 00:30.738
Sudden mood swings, infantile
regression, abdominal pain.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.700
He's passed out twice. Yeah, I think
it might be a medical problem.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.493
He's 20 minutes late.
I'm out of here.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.078
Please.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.329
He'll be here.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.622
Why?

00:39.748 --> 00:41.874
Because he loves you
and does everything he's told?

00:42.000 --> 00:45.545
Because I didn't tell him
you'd be here.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.887
He likes to see.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.764
Yes, he does.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.892
Stacy?

01:00.769 --> 01:02.687
- What's going on?
- Hey.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.939
Hi, I'm Greg House. You must be Matt.

01:05.065 --> 01:05.898
Mark.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.525
Mark Warner. Don't get up.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.445
Sorry. Parent conferences.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.738
- It's okay.
- Hi.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.699
Wow. Greg House.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.159
Yeah. Wow.

01:16.285 --> 01:19.162
No, I haven't been avoiding you. I
just didn't want to waste your time.

01:19.288 --> 01:22.123
The other doctors checked me out.
They said it was just stress.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.584
College season. Kids, parents...
They're all over me.

01:24.710 --> 01:25.835
Makes sense to me.

01:25.961 --> 01:26.961
- Greg.
- What do you want me to do?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.129
You said you'd check him out.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.715
He says he's healthy.
What's to check out?

01:30.841 --> 01:34.427
Sorry for the mix-up, but I'm glad
you two got a chance to catch up.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.012
Looks like you're having fun.

01:36.138 --> 01:37.388
Oh, he's good.

01:38.223 --> 01:41.768
If you can fake sincerity,
you can fake pretty much anything.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.811
I can't tell you
how much I like your fellow.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.688
Yeah, me, too.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.316
You know, I thought
you'd be all sarcastic.

01:48.442 --> 01:52.528
Bitter, you know,
because Stacy married me.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.030
You know,
we should do things together.

01:54.156 --> 01:56.574
Maybe throw a ball around
or something. Guy stuff.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.867
We could go for a run together.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.160
It's Oscar Wilde.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.871
Wow. This pissing contest is
really turning me on.

02:01.997 --> 02:03.080
He needs to go to the hospital.

02:03.207 --> 02:04.165
Here's to women.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.250
Can't live with them,
you can't kill them

02:06.376 --> 02:08.628
and tell the neighbors
they're stripping in Atlantic City.

02:08.754 --> 02:11.088
Damn straight.

02:15.886 --> 02:16.844
I'm definitely taller.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.513
I have more hair.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.097
And I think that...

02:21.350 --> 02:22.517
Mark?

02:25.479 --> 02:27.772
Someone call 911 for a wagon
to Princeton-Plainsboro?

02:27.898 --> 02:28.898
Garçon!

02:31.151 --> 02:32.151
What happened?

02:32.277 --> 02:33.319
It's okay,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:33.445 --> 02:34.779
Nothing to worry about.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.781
- Unless you had the veal.
- You dosed him.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.116
I told you I'd check him out.
I was a little worried

02:39.243 --> 02:40.993
they were gonna get here
before he passed out.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.204
Would have been tougher
to get him to drink.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.832
I'll give you a ride. We can talk.

03:26.790 --> 03:30.793
Tummy ache, cranky,
no apparent source.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.796
Any thoughts?

03:33.922 --> 03:38.384
Foreman, you gonna contribute, or are
you too tired from stealing cars?

03:41.305 --> 03:42.889
I'm being House. It's funny.

03:43.015 --> 03:45.433
I know.
You made milk come out of my nose.

03:45.559 --> 03:49.186
Morning. You guys got the file.
What's wrong?

03:49.313 --> 03:51.856
Previous tests revealed nothing
that would cause abdominal pain

03:51.982 --> 03:53.274
or the mood swings.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.068
Then we're done. What do you think?
Ball game? Zoo?

03:56.194 --> 03:57.778
I don't care.
I just want to hang with you guys.

03:57.905 --> 03:58.905
What about drugs?

03:59.031 --> 04:02.158
His tox screen on admission showed
a massive amount of chloral hydrate.

04:02.284 --> 04:05.161
Yeah. Sorry. That was me.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.954
I had to dope him up
to get him in here.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.748
Guy doesn't think he's sick.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.124
Who does?

04:10.250 --> 04:11.334
His wife.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.960
The woman you used to live with.

04:13.086 --> 04:17.048
That's her Indian name.
On her driver's license, it's Stacy.

04:17.174 --> 04:18.257
I assume you have a point.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.343
You believe her
over the patient himself.

04:20.469 --> 04:21.802
That's why we're taking this case.

04:21.929 --> 04:25.681
The truth? I hear voices all the time
telling me to do stuff.

04:25.807 --> 04:26.974
It's crazy, huh?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.143
What happened to "everybody lies"?

04:29.811 --> 04:32.104
I was lying.

04:32.230 --> 04:34.273
Do the things, the, you know,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.524
All that stuff the other docs did.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.276
If that's negative,
ultrasound his belly.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.071
If that's negative,
CT his abdomen and pelvis,

04:40.197 --> 04:41.822
with and without contrast.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.699
- Did I miss anything?
- Kitchen sink.

04:43.825 --> 04:47.536
Well, we could certainly give that...
Oh, you minx!

04:49.539 --> 04:51.916
What you're thinking is,
you're going to save him,

04:52.042 --> 04:53.751
be a hero and win her back.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.545
It's always impressive,
that level of twisted narcissism.

04:56.672 --> 04:59.548
She's married.
It was the big clue I lost the game.

04:59.675 --> 05:02.927
You can't be within 50 feet of
Stacy Warner.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.679
Thought she wanted me to treat him.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.223
Treat the husband,
stay away from the wife.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.350
But what if they get close to
each other? What do I do then?

05:09.476 --> 05:13.104
Hey. You have to treat this
like a regular case.

05:13.230 --> 05:17.316
Be yourself, cold, uncaring, distant.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.944
Please, don't put me on a pedestal.

05:21.446 --> 05:27.576
We CT'd your abdomen. Nothing that
would explain the stomach pain.

05:27.703 --> 05:29.578
- What's the next move?
- Leaving.

05:29.705 --> 05:31.664
Now, how many more tests do I need?

05:31.790 --> 05:33.165
How many more doctors
need to clear me

05:33.291 --> 05:34.417
before we can get back to our life?

05:34.543 --> 05:36.419
- Just one.
- House.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.754
It must be awkward
being treated by a man

05:38.880 --> 05:41.507
who used to be involved
with your wife.

05:44.845 --> 05:49.223
It's awkward being in a hospital when
there's nothing wrong with me.

05:49.933 --> 05:53.310
MRA's were clean,
which means he's probably fine.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.604
He doesn't seem paranoid.
He shows no signs...

05:55.731 --> 05:57.898
No. It means we have no idea
what's wrong with him.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.608
Ben Goldstein says
his schedule's locked.

05:59.735 --> 06:00.735
He can't do it before tomorrow.

06:00.861 --> 06:04.321
No. Today. Call him,
tell him I'll make it work.

06:04.448 --> 06:05.531
You're cutting him open?

06:05.657 --> 06:06.907
Oh, hold it.

06:07.034 --> 06:10.453
There's no need for exploratory
surgery. Dr. Cameron has a diagnosis.

06:10.579 --> 06:13.414
No, I just think it's premature
and maybe irresponsible

06:13.540 --> 06:15.958
to do exploratory surgery
before we know he's actually sick.

06:16.084 --> 06:19.462
No, it's premature to put him
on a list for hospice care.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.088
And it's maybe irresponsible to imply

06:21.214 --> 06:22.882
my actions are not
rationally supported.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.175
All we have is his wife...

06:24.301 --> 06:25.634
Who says his stomach hurts.

06:25.761 --> 06:27.803
Works for me. The patient
doesn't even think he's sick.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.805
- Why would he consent...
- His wife's a lawyer.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.682
She's very convincing.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.810
Call Goldstein. The surgery is on.

06:47.616 --> 06:48.908
Retract.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.787
Insert.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.083
Leslie vs Leslie seems to be
right on point,

06:57.209 --> 07:00.336
but I'm sure they're going to try
to distinguish it by...

07:00.462 --> 07:04.799
Sorry. They'll try to distinguish it
relying on the minority opinion.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.054
Double milk, no sugar.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.555
I like sugar now.

07:25.821 --> 07:28.739
Some people would be annoyed by that.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.953
You know why people sit
in waiting rooms?

07:34.079 --> 07:35.412
This is gonna be good.

07:35.539 --> 07:39.083
People think the closer they're
sitting to the operating room,

07:39.209 --> 07:40.292
the more they care.

07:40.418 --> 07:44.255
That's why I'm here. I'm not moving
until everybody sees me.

07:48.552 --> 07:51.137
Are you doing anybody besides Mark?

07:52.347 --> 07:53.764
It's a medical question.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.350
Because if I am,
his paranoia isn't paranoia.

07:56.476 --> 08:00.479
It's a justified response,
therefore not a legitimate symptom.

08:00.605 --> 08:01.814
Knew you'd understand.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.150
On the other hand, if it was really
just a medical question,

08:04.276 --> 08:05.776
you would have sent
one of your people.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.695
Why just push my buttons
when you can push theirs, too?

08:07.821 --> 08:12.283
Hey, Dr. Mandingo, go ask the wife
if she's been messing around.

08:12.409 --> 08:17.663
But you're asking
because if I am unfaithful,

08:17.789 --> 08:19.790
I might sleep with you.

08:20.959 --> 08:24.253
The answer's no.
I don't sleep around.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.338
Make sure you note that in his file.

08:26.464 --> 08:27.840
Mrs. Warner.

08:27.966 --> 08:31.552
The surgery went well. He's in
Recovery. You can see him now.

08:38.059 --> 08:41.061
Goldstein found nothing
but a distended bladder.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.398
Neurogenic bladder
isn't causing the pain.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.026
It also doesn't cause
personality changes.

08:47.152 --> 08:51.113
On the other hand, it would account
for Cameron's diagnosis.

08:51.239 --> 08:54.158
The patient's completely healthy.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.703
Get me the video of the surgery.

10:09.401 --> 10:12.987
Dr. Mandingo, you're needed
at the plantation house.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.953
Well, don't everybody talk at once.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.622
There's nothing there.

10:27.210 --> 10:31.171
Stop looking at the suspiciously
empty bottle and look at the screen.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.924
Here's why I get the big bucks.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.051
This is nothing.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.637
An enhanced version of nothing.

10:38.763 --> 10:42.224
This... is the problem.

10:47.772 --> 10:48.814
Unbelievable.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.274
Tremors in the muscle fiber.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.901
That's not peristalsis.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.486
That's abdominal epilepsy.

10:54.612 --> 10:57.865
Means there's some sort of
neurological problem.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.784
A time bomb in his brain.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.954
I forget. Who said it was nothing?

11:11.004 --> 11:13.839
I saw a very small, diffuse
abnormality in the brain waves.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.507
Probably white matter.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.593
Means his axonal nerves are dying.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.345
Explains the neurogenic bladder.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.847
Enough nerves die, he dies.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.807
Global axonal nerve death.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.185
Likely causes are encephalitis
or Alzheimer's.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.187
Early onset Alzheimer's. The worst.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.689
He won't die right away.
He'll just want to.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.567
I'll check the blood for
Alzheimer's protein markers.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.111
Last I heard, Alzheimer's
had a genetic component.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.780
Did the patient have parents?

11:37.906 --> 11:40.366
Parents died in a car crash.
No history of dementia.

11:40.492 --> 11:44.286
Send CSF for CBC and viral serologies
to rule out encephalitis,

11:44.412 --> 11:47.247
and get tau proteins
to check for Alzheimer's.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.874
And this still feels a little light.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.668
I took a complete medical history.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.921
Check out their house.
Take Sparky with you.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.215
They live in Short Hills.
Two hours away.

11:56.341 --> 11:57.883
You can expense the tolls.

11:58.009 --> 12:00.177
You're not interested
in a medical history.

12:00.303 --> 12:02.429
You're a Peeping Tom
trying to spy on your ex.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.057
Her secret diary.
That's the main thing.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.393
But as long as you're there,
take a peek in the medicine cabinet.

12:07.519 --> 12:10.521
Check for toxins, heavy metals,
anything that might explain this

12:10.647 --> 12:13.899
other than encephalitis
or Alzheimer's.

12:15.151 --> 12:18.028
And get receipts for the tolls.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.709
Making lunch?
I assume that's for Mark.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.879
We know about his parents.
What about further back?

12:36.005 --> 12:37.923
Grandparents, uncles, aunts.
How was their health?

12:38.049 --> 12:41.009
Greg hates fishing.
He's got a theory.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.014
Most likely candidate right now is
Alzheimer's.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.899
No. There's been no memory loss.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.735
I mean, he forgets where he left
his keys, but who doesn't?

12:58.862 --> 13:00.904
Any family history?

13:01.030 --> 13:03.574
Of? Whacked-outness?

13:03.700 --> 13:07.661
His sister voted for Nader, twice.
That's about it.

13:10.582 --> 13:14.835
You were with House
when it happened to his leg?

13:18.423 --> 13:20.591
You're interested in him.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.676
We went on one date.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.803
It didn't go very well.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.180
Our first date didn't either.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.850
I was never gonna see him again.
A week later, I moved in.

13:29.976 --> 13:33.645
Five years.
What would you like to know?

13:34.772 --> 13:37.191
What was he like before his leg?

13:38.943 --> 13:40.903
Pretty much the same.

13:49.871 --> 13:52.789
He's clear. No Alzheimer's.

13:53.708 --> 13:56.084
Yeah, that's what I figured.

14:05.553 --> 14:09.139
Serious mountain bike.
Hasn't been used in a while, though.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.142
He switched to yoga.
Brand-new yoga mat and tape.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.227
Man's getting older.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.436
Or it might indicate back pain.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.104
Wife would have mentioned it.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.398
Yoga's good for picking up
the ladies, too.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.234
Not when you do it in your own home.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.069
Change could be just a change,
not a symptom.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.574
Chase.

14:29.661 --> 14:33.080
"Dear House boys, a snack
for your highly illegal search.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.541
"Hope you like oatmeal raisin.
Love, Stacy."

14:36.751 --> 14:39.628
In a desk drawer, hidden in the back
under some papers.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.088
Secret stash.

14:42.173 --> 14:43.715
Amphetamines.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.926
Regular use could lead to
neurotoxicity.

14:46.052 --> 14:49.763
Explains the axonal nerve damage
and the personality issues.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.016
On the other hand,
"Prescribed to W. Brown."

14:53.142 --> 14:54.518
Fake name.
Fake prescription.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.938
Could be, but the prescribing doc,
his name's real.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.481
This guy's just had
his license pulled

14:59.607 --> 15:02.150
for writing illegal prescriptions to
high school kids.

15:02.277 --> 15:03.777
Mark's a high school
guidance counselor.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.738
And Mr. Brown's birth date
makes him 17 years old.

15:06.864 --> 15:11.618
Maybe these were confiscated
by a high school guidance counselor?

15:12.287 --> 15:13.704
Anything else?

15:13.830 --> 15:16.123
Yeah, he switched from
mountain biking to yoga.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.749
- Could indicate...
- He's getting older.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.710
What did the CSF say
about encephalitis?

15:19.836 --> 15:21.420
Said no. Champagne tap.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.463
No red cells, no white cells.
Serology's negative.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.299
Which means we're back to
Alzheimer's.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.051
I told her he didn't have it.
The marker tests were negative.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.929
Well, then you should have told her
that. He could still have it.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.140
PET scan will reveal any change
in metabolic activity

15:33.266 --> 15:37.185
in the cerebral cortex.
Run him through and check his memory.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.400
We're going to inject a chemical
marker called FDDNP,

15:43.526 --> 15:45.235
and then I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.653
- Test my memory.
- Yeah,

15:46.779 --> 15:48.947
but first we're gonna map out
some specific brain functions.

15:49.073 --> 15:52.868
You know, check out the engine
before we take the car for a drive.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.126
Checking up on me?

16:01.252 --> 16:04.171
- I like all the pretty lights.
- Yeah.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.435
Okay.

16:18.561 --> 16:19.895
Here we go.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.021
Your full name?

16:21.147 --> 16:22.481
Mark Warner.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.317
Is your mother living?

16:25.443 --> 16:26.818
No.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.904
Limbic system's intact.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.823
Okay, say you find a stamped envelope
on the street. What do you do?

16:31.949 --> 16:33.492
Find a mailbox and mail it.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.243
Jeez. What a guy.

16:36.371 --> 16:39.581
His frontal lobe is working way
better than mine.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.000
Do you remember when you got married?

16:42.126 --> 16:44.252
Three years ago this July.
Who is that?

16:44.379 --> 16:47.881
What? Could be a problem
with his long-term memory.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.883
- Big church wedding?
- Is that House?

16:50.009 --> 16:53.637
- He remembers voices.
- This serves no diagnostic purpose.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.889
I thought you skimped on
the limbic system there.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.725
Emotional reactions.
I just want to be thorough.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.312
Did the atheistic bride wear
a pretty white dress?

17:02.438 --> 17:06.358
Was she thinking of you? Is that what
you medically need to know?

17:06.484 --> 17:08.276
What jewelry did your bride wear?

17:08.403 --> 17:12.030
She never wears any jewelry, except
that cross her mother gave to her.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.825
No underwear either,
at least not that day.

17:14.951 --> 17:18.286
I remember 'cause she ripped her
pretty white dress off in the car.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.330
That the sort of answer
you're looking for, Doctor?

17:20.456 --> 17:22.958
- I think I upset him.
- You gotta stop this now.

17:23.084 --> 17:25.168
I remember
the honeymoon was in Paris.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.922
I remember 'cause we didn't leave
the room for two weeks.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.424
You want the details on that?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.634
A little defensive.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.762
It's not paranoia
if someone's out to get you.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.236
Here we go.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.908
He's sick, paranoid, and you keep
hammering him about me.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.910
The questions were designed to define

17:59.036 --> 18:01.079
the operational parameters of
his limbic system.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.372
Elevate the words all you want.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.958
You were just screwing with him.
Low, even by your standards.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.960
Medical screwing. It's what I do.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.712
And then you run away
like a 12-year-old.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.922
Go hide on the roof
like you always do.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.675
I haven't been up here in five years.

18:27.732 --> 18:30.192
I don't know what's wrong with him.

18:31.861 --> 18:35.989
It's not Alzheimer's.
It's not encephalitis.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.658
It's not environmental.
It's not immunological.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.703
Every test is negative, every time.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.706
He's perfectly healthy,

18:44.832 --> 18:46.792
but his brain is dying.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.802
It never occurred to me

18:56.928 --> 18:59.805
that you couldn't figure out
what's wrong.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.907
I haven't given up.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.291
So what do we do?

19:35.007 --> 19:36.925
We wait.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.013
For what?

19:42.139 --> 19:44.099
Something to change.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.813
It's one of the great tragedies of
life. Something always...

19:50.982 --> 19:52.983
Something always changes.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.954
Nurse?

20:06.497 --> 20:08.039
Nurse!

20:16.090 --> 20:17.799
What happened? What's wrong?

20:17.925 --> 20:21.845
My toes. They were numb,
tingling, then nothing.

20:22.847 --> 20:23.805
No pain. Nothing.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.765
It's okay.
They're going to take care of you.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.101
I'm scared, Stacy. Hold my hand.

20:32.023 --> 20:33.189
What?

20:43.659 --> 20:45.035
What's happening?

20:45.161 --> 20:49.039
Time marches on. He's paralyzed.

20:59.759 --> 21:03.136
His symptoms mimic a peripheral
nervous system under attack.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.931
But he's experiencing
significant paresthesias,

21:06.057 --> 21:07.557
and he can't move his hands or toes.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.517
It's peripheral.

21:09.644 --> 21:12.103
Guillain-Barré syndrome
attacks there, not the brain.

21:12.229 --> 21:15.023
No. No, I already did
an indirect Coombs' test.

21:15.149 --> 21:17.275
No agglutination, no antibodies.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.611
Initiative. Like that.

21:19.737 --> 21:20.695
Start him on IV immunos...

21:20.821 --> 21:24.699
No antibodies means he doesn't have
Guillain-Barré, period.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.035
Period? More like dot, dot, dot.

21:27.161 --> 21:29.704
What if he has the virus but
isn't producing those antibodies?

21:29.830 --> 21:31.414
Come on. The chances of that are...

21:31.540 --> 21:34.334
Didn't ask about the Vegas line.
I said, "What if?"

21:34.460 --> 21:37.545
It would mean he's sick, and his
body's not doing anything about it.

21:37.672 --> 21:40.840
So we either fight it for him
or it's fatal.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.467
Fatal sounds very bad to me.

21:42.593 --> 21:45.345
Well, without the antibodies,
we can't even test for it.

21:45.471 --> 21:47.180
Don't know if we're right.

21:48.057 --> 21:51.601
Treatment isn't all that dangerous,
plasmapheresis and IVIg.

21:51.727 --> 21:55.313
If it works, we're right.
If he dies...

21:56.315 --> 21:57.774
It was something else.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.447
So the paralysis
might not be permanent?

22:04.573 --> 22:08.243
That's our hope, but the brain's
tricky. You never know.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.581
What was that? What?

22:13.708 --> 22:15.875
With the head. The look.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.711
He just wants to talk to me.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.879
Well, if it was medical,
he should be talking to me.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.756
I'll be just outside the door.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.883
Leave! Go talk to him!

22:24.010 --> 22:25.552
You're going to leave me anyway.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.846
No. That's not gonna happen.

22:27.972 --> 22:32.392
You left him, and he had a limp.
If I can't walk, or hold you...

22:32.518 --> 22:35.729
Honey, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going to talk to him.

22:35.855 --> 22:36.688
If I can't feed myself...

22:36.814 --> 22:38.064
Mark, what you're feeling,
it's not real.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.482
It's the virus.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.569
Mark? What is it?

22:42.695 --> 22:43.653
Mark?

22:43.779 --> 22:48.158
His throat's closing up.
He can't breathe. Code blue! Hurry!

22:48.284 --> 22:51.411
He's having a reaction to the IVIg.
I need epi, stat.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.205
I can't get the scope in his throat.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.373
Stop that.

22:55.499 --> 22:56.750
He's having an allergic reaction.
He's crashing.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.461
No, he's not. Look at his vitals.

22:59.587 --> 23:01.755
O2 sats are within range.

23:01.881 --> 23:05.216
I'm betting the only abnormal sign is
sweaty palms.

23:07.595 --> 23:09.929
Push two milligrams Ativan.

23:22.026 --> 23:25.528
No allergic reaction.
Just a panic attack.

23:25.654 --> 23:28.114
Something obviously freaked him out.

23:30.826 --> 23:32.744
Can we talk now?

23:35.664 --> 23:37.040
You couldn't just come
into the room?

23:37.166 --> 23:41.419
He's had five visitors drive down.
I didn't recognize any of them.

23:41.545 --> 23:44.631
Six more have sent him flowers,
candy and a teddy bear,

23:44.757 --> 23:47.008
which I'm sure
he finds very comforting.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.677
But I didn't recognize
any of the names on the cards.

23:49.804 --> 23:52.222
Shockingly, Mark has friends,
and I have some new ones.

23:52.348 --> 23:55.141
No, it's not shocking
that you have new friends,

23:55.267 --> 23:58.186
but it is shocking that you
apparently dumped all your old ones.

23:58.312 --> 24:00.271
I haven't.

24:00.397 --> 24:03.108
No, I didn't think so.

24:03.234 --> 24:06.444
I just think you didn't tell any of
them that you were down here.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.822
Now, why would that be?

24:10.574 --> 24:13.535
What are you up to?
It's gonna take a little while...

24:14.453 --> 24:17.664
Why would you not tell
your oldest friends

24:17.790 --> 24:19.332
that you were taking Mark to

24:19.458 --> 24:22.335
Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching
Hospital to try to save his life?

24:22.461 --> 24:24.546
I've been busy. I haven't kept track
of who knows what.

24:24.672 --> 24:28.842
See, my old friends are telling me to
be careful. They seem to think...

24:28.968 --> 24:31.177
He. And he sent me the bear.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.721
Figures.

24:33.848 --> 24:38.434
He seems to think
that I'm not over you,

24:39.436 --> 24:42.772
and that it might be dangerous for me
to spend time with you.

24:42.898 --> 24:46.818
I'm thinking your friends
might have similar concerns,

24:46.944 --> 24:49.612
and so you didn't tell them
you'd be here with me.

24:49.738 --> 24:52.031
What's your point?
That I'm still in love with you?

24:52.158 --> 24:56.035
I should abandon my dying husband,
and we should head for Rio?

24:57.830 --> 24:58.997
No.

24:59.957 --> 25:02.125
Greg, I appreciate
what you're doing for us,

25:02.251 --> 25:04.085
but I think maybe Wilson's right.

25:04.211 --> 25:07.505
Maybe you should just stay away
from me.

25:48.422 --> 25:50.840
What's up?

25:50.966 --> 25:53.843
Love the bear. It's adorable.

25:53.969 --> 25:56.554
My wife's gonna kill me.
We're having company. She cooked.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.098
I got Mark's latest blood work.

25:59.683 --> 26:02.602
He's not responding to treatment.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.897
I'm sorry.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.982
I was happy.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.906
He's my patient.

26:15.032 --> 26:18.034
I'm sure he's a good guy.
He's probably a great guy.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.787
He's apparently a much better guy
than I am.

26:22.289 --> 26:25.124
And some part of me wants him to die.

26:30.631 --> 26:35.051
I'm just not sure if it's because
I want to be with her,

26:35.177 --> 26:38.972
or it's because I want her to suffer.

26:51.402 --> 26:55.029
Hey. Is it okay if I talk to Stacy
for a minute?

26:56.907 --> 26:59.325
I'll be just outside, honey.

27:07.001 --> 27:09.168
You two are good together.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.629
You know nothing about Mark.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.881
He took you to Paris.

27:14.008 --> 27:16.009
That's good enough for me.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.597
We never went to Paris.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.893
Your honeymoon.
It's been your dream city.

27:26.020 --> 27:28.771
You wanted to go since you were 16.
He actually took you.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.231
No, I had to work.

27:30.357 --> 27:33.067
We spent the night in New York,
then we went back to Short Hills.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.528
What is it?

27:35.654 --> 27:38.906
When did Mark switch from
mountain biking to yoga?

27:39.033 --> 27:41.284
About a month ago.

27:41.410 --> 27:44.704
The same time he started getting
sick. What does that mean?

27:44.830 --> 27:47.248
We have two more symptoms.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.585
The patient was asked a series of
questions

27:50.711 --> 27:53.338
to determine the functionality of
his brain.

27:53.464 --> 27:55.423
You grilled him about Stacy.

27:55.549 --> 27:56.716
Whatever.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.426
Yeah, the point is,
he told us everything

27:58.552 --> 28:00.887
we need to know to diagnose him.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.890
That is, if we use your fancy
PET scan as a lie detector.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.184
See, it's a very creative process,
lying.

28:06.310 --> 28:10.021
Now, telling the truth is
a much simpler process. See here.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.147
Question nine.

28:11.273 --> 28:13.066
This is where Mark gives a long,
rambling answer

28:13.192 --> 28:14.859
about taking Stacy to Paris.

28:14.985 --> 28:16.361
What does the PET scan say?

28:16.487 --> 28:19.322
Minimal involvement.
Just the frontal and temporal lobes.

28:19.448 --> 28:23.117
He said he went to Paris,
and the PET confirms it. So, what?

28:23.243 --> 28:25.411
They didn't go.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.498
They didn't go to Paris, and yet
Mark's brain apparently thinks

28:28.624 --> 28:32.126
that he really did spend 40 francs
on a tour of the Bastille.

28:32.252 --> 28:36.381
So we have an intermittent syndrome
that presents with abdominal pain,

28:36.507 --> 28:39.217
polyneuropathy, paranoia,

28:39.343 --> 28:42.762
and delusions.

28:42.888 --> 28:46.140
Now, here's the thing about
Acute Intermittent Porphyria.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.935
It'll jump you in a dark alley,
beat the crap out of you,

28:49.061 --> 28:50.311
leave you bleeding.

28:50.437 --> 28:52.605
But it wears gloves,
so no fingerprints.

28:52.731 --> 28:56.401
Doesn't show up in blood tests,
urine tests, nothing.

28:56.527 --> 29:00.613
Unless you catch it red-handed
in the middle of an attack.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.116
But there are other symptoms of AIP.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.785
- Such as?
- Light sensitivity.

29:05.911 --> 29:08.454
Yeah. One of the true tragedies of
this condition

29:08.580 --> 29:10.790
is that it makes you want to stick
your cool, new mountain bike

29:10.916 --> 29:14.710
in the garage and take up
an indoor sport like, say, yoga.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.296
Start the treatment.
Hematin and glucose.

29:17.423 --> 29:20.633
If you give him Hematin now
and you're wrong, he dies today.

29:20.759 --> 29:24.178
There's only one way to confirm AIP,
urine sample made during the attack.

29:24.304 --> 29:27.181
And there's no way to predict
when he'll have another attack.

29:27.307 --> 29:28.891
Sure there is.

29:29.017 --> 29:32.770
Acute Intermittent Porphyria
has very specific triggers.

29:32.896 --> 29:37.525
Barbiturates, alcohol, high levels of
protein will set off an attack.

29:37.651 --> 29:39.152
Which trigger do you think
set off Mark's?

29:39.278 --> 29:40.611
Not the faintest idea.

29:40.737 --> 29:43.531
That's why I'm gonna give him
the combo plate. All of it.

29:43.657 --> 29:45.783
So if he has this,
and you trigger an attack,

29:45.909 --> 29:48.369
the attack makes him worse, right?

29:48.495 --> 29:51.914
Yeah. But then we'll know what it is,
and we can treat it.

29:53.876 --> 29:59.589
But if I don't have this thing and
you give me that shot, what happens?

30:00.883 --> 30:02.341
No idea.

30:02.468 --> 30:03.843
If we don't know
what's messing up your brain,

30:03.969 --> 30:06.053
we don't know how you'll react.

30:10.142 --> 30:13.269
Okay, I need a minute
with my husband.

30:47.888 --> 30:49.889
He doesn't want the trigger.

30:50.015 --> 30:53.976
He wants to wait, see if we can
come up with another explanation.

30:54.102 --> 30:56.979
If it is AIP,
how much time does he have?

30:57.105 --> 31:00.858
No idea. Next attack could be fatal.

31:00.984 --> 31:04.946
Could be six months from now.
Could be five minutes from now.

31:05.072 --> 31:07.198
- I want you to test him.
- Fine.

31:07.324 --> 31:09.909
I'll send for
an HMB synthase mutation.

31:10.035 --> 31:13.496
Genetic test. The lab will get back
to us in a month.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.957
Give him the cocktail,
set off an attack.

31:16.667 --> 31:18.751
- No.
- Why not?

31:18.877 --> 31:19.961
Because he doesn't want me to.

31:20.128 --> 31:22.838
I'm not gonna sue you.
I'm not gonna report you.

31:22.965 --> 31:24.715
- He might.
- He's paralyzed.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.343
Either you cure him,
or he won't be writing any letters.

31:27.469 --> 31:29.637
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Why not?

31:29.763 --> 31:32.473
You keep asking me that question.
My answer doesn't change.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.560
I gave him the parameters.
It's his call.

31:38.188 --> 31:39.605
You want him to die.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.399
I diagnosed him. I did my job.

31:41.525 --> 31:43.568
You want somebody to tie him down
and force him into treatment,

31:43.694 --> 31:45.528
well, you're way better at that
than I am.

31:45.654 --> 31:48.197
Is that what this is?
Payback for your leg?

31:48.323 --> 31:50.950
How many times have we been
over this? I saved your life.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.159
Yeah, maybe.

31:52.286 --> 31:54.870
You're gonna kill my husband
to teach me a lesson?

31:54.997 --> 31:57.707
No. He's gonna die 'cause he's too
stubborn to make the right choice.

31:57.833 --> 32:00.001
Now we're in your territory.

32:01.378 --> 32:03.212
I'm respecting
your husband's decision.

32:03.338 --> 32:04.714
I don't see
why you've got a problem with that.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.632
Because it's crap.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.176
Because you browbeat patients,
intimidate them, lie to them.

32:09.303 --> 32:12.179
If you think you're right, you don't
give a damn what they think.

32:12.306 --> 32:16.934
I did what you do all the time. The
only difference is, I did it to you.

32:21.898 --> 32:23.899
He'll never forgive you.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.903
Yeah. He will.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.335
Still no change.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.794
He's not getting worse?

32:43.920 --> 32:45.338
No. No change at all.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.173
And that's consistent
with AIP, right?

32:47.299 --> 32:49.634
Until he has another attack,
his condition's stable.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.843
Yeah.

32:50.969 --> 32:51.886
Mark, you've got to.

32:52.012 --> 32:54.013
I don't want to take that test,

32:54.139 --> 32:55.806
not until they're sure.

32:55.932 --> 32:58.309
- You don't know Greg.
- Not like you do.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.020
I only met him when he drugged me.

33:01.146 --> 33:04.815
Boy, are my ears burning.

33:04.941 --> 33:05.983
What's that?

33:06.109 --> 33:07.234
Cocktail hour.

33:07.361 --> 33:09.820
Just 'cause you can't hoist a few
doesn't mean you should be left out.

33:09.946 --> 33:11.155
Get away from me.

33:11.281 --> 33:13.157
Mark, if this is what he thinks
is wrong with you...

33:13.283 --> 33:14.909
You trust his judgment
more than mine?

33:15.035 --> 33:16.035
His medical judgment.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.788
- And you'd bet my life on that?
- I would.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.748
I don't.

33:20.874 --> 33:22.375
Smart.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.919
It's too bad you're paralyzed.

33:34.721 --> 33:37.890
Bing! Paging Dr. Foreman.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.892
Leave the room.
It's not your problem.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.435
You need the consent from him.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.270
But, Doc, he ain't right in the head.

33:43.397 --> 33:44.647
Then you need a court order.

33:44.773 --> 33:48.859
Okay. Then get one. We'll wait here.
I won't do nothing.

33:52.280 --> 33:55.491
Oh... Love the Musketeer thing.

33:55.617 --> 33:56.784
I got goose bumps.

33:56.910 --> 33:59.453
Give me the syringe.

33:59.579 --> 34:03.332
Please. If you're right,
this may be his only shot.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.042
So what's your plan?

34:05.168 --> 34:06.585
You take the big, dark one,
I've got the little girl,

34:06.712 --> 34:10.840
and the Aussie will run like a scared
wombat if things turn rough.

34:17.347 --> 34:18.723
I can't do it.

34:29.609 --> 34:31.318
You son of a bitch!

34:32.320 --> 34:34.572
See what I did there?

34:39.953 --> 34:40.911
When does it happen?

34:41.037 --> 34:42.538
If he had AIP,
should've already happened.

34:42.664 --> 34:43.622
Everyone's different.

34:43.749 --> 34:44.832
This is not good.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.960
He could have an embolism,
tachycardia, stroke.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.170
What's happening?

34:49.296 --> 34:50.296
Two milligrams of Ativan.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.673
Is that an attack?

34:53.717 --> 34:54.967
Here.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.719
No. You'll pollute the sample.

34:56.845 --> 34:58.721
Chase, get urine from the catheter.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.765
It's not an attack! He's stroking.

35:01.475 --> 35:02.641
He needs Ativan!

35:02.768 --> 35:06.604
This is not a stroke. The delta-wave
burst is just a vasospasm.

35:06.730 --> 35:08.355
Catheter's out.
There's no way to collect the sample.

35:08.482 --> 35:09.732
Heart rate's in the 40s. Bradycardia.

35:09.858 --> 35:11.233
We're losing him. Hold him down.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.235
- Give him something!
- No painkillers.

35:13.361 --> 35:14.862
You were wrong.

35:25.791 --> 35:29.543
Straight from the bladder.
That's as fresh as it gets.

35:29.669 --> 35:31.337
Would you give him
the Ativan already?

35:31.463 --> 35:34.048
He doesn't need to be awake for this.

35:56.738 --> 35:58.614
It's still yellow.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.951
Move.

36:02.077 --> 36:04.203
What?

36:04.329 --> 36:06.497
You think another light's gonna make
the difference?

36:06.623 --> 36:09.959
Organic chem, more light,
more oxidation.

36:10.085 --> 36:12.044
Does that ring any bells?

36:21.137 --> 36:25.808
Start the patient on 150 milligrams
glucose, 75 milligrams Hematin.

36:53.253 --> 36:55.212
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:56.339 --> 36:59.258
You wanna thumb wrestle?

36:59.384 --> 37:00.551
Come on.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.558
- He's still a maniac.
- I know.

37:32.292 --> 37:35.294
Dr. House? How's he doing?

37:39.424 --> 37:41.342
Never better.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.973
I thought

37:48.099 --> 37:50.768
you were too screwed up
to love anyone.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.438
I was wrong.

37:56.358 --> 37:58.442
You just couldn't love me.

38:02.072 --> 38:03.739
It's good.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.201
I'm happy for you.

38:52.414 --> 38:54.123
You fixed him.

38:56.501 --> 38:57.876
De nada.

38:58.795 --> 39:00.713
Thank you.

39:03.299 --> 39:05.009
You were right.

39:05.510 --> 39:08.012
- He's gonna be fine.
- No. About me.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.433
I'm not over you.

39:16.396 --> 39:21.567
You were... You were the one.
You always will be.

39:25.238 --> 39:27.239
But I can't be with you.

39:36.291 --> 39:38.292
So I'm the guy,

39:39.419 --> 39:41.045
but you want the other guy,

39:41.171 --> 39:44.339
who, by definition,
can never be the guy.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.720
What's so great about you is
you always think you're right.

39:49.846 --> 39:54.391
And what's so frustrating about you
is you are right so much of the time.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.395
You are brilliant,

39:58.521 --> 40:01.899
funny, surprising, sexy.

40:07.614 --> 40:12.284
But with you, I was lonely.
And with Mark, there's room for me.

40:16.289 --> 40:17.915
I see.

41:04.003 --> 41:06.713
I want to run something by you.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.883
I will not have sex
with you! Not again.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.052
It was miserable that first time.

41:12.178 --> 41:14.096
All that desperate
administrative need.

41:14.222 --> 41:18.892
Stacy's husband is going to need
close monitoring at the hospital,

41:19.018 --> 41:21.228
and since we can definitely use her
back here,

41:21.354 --> 41:24.523
I've offered her a job,
general counsel.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.943
Did she say yes?

41:28.069 --> 41:31.655
She said only
if it was okay with you.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.451
Yes or no?

41:42.584 --> 41:44.793
Fine. Good.
