<i>Previously on</i> Bones...

00:01.568 --> 00:02.586
Hold on, Zack, okay?

00:02.588 --> 00:04.637
This is a transfer, you
understand that, correct?

00:04.638 --> 00:06.371
I never killed the lobbyist.

00:06.405 --> 00:09.182
I confessed because I assumed
I would if I'd been instructed,

00:09.183 --> 00:12.051
but then last night I learned
I'm not capable of killing.

00:12.085 --> 00:13.685
I believe you.

00:13.720 --> 00:16.421
I think I may have found
a way to prove

00:16.456 --> 00:17.655
that the killer wasn't Zack

00:17.691 --> 00:19.424
based on the severity
of the stabbing.

00:19.459 --> 00:21.259
Wow. This is conclusive.

00:21.294 --> 00:23.761
And yet, you don't seem excited.

00:23.797 --> 00:25.363
Well, I'm just a little worried

00:25.398 --> 00:27.232
that this is too good
to be true.

00:27.267 --> 00:29.067
You think I planted evidence.

00:29.102 --> 00:31.936
I can't look at evidence that
may have been tampered with.

00:31.972 --> 00:34.072

Dr. Hodgins, you're here

What?

00:52.926 --> 00:55.159
Oh, wait. Don't tell me
it's morning already.

00:55.195 --> 00:57.428
Angela is going to kill me.

00:57.464 --> 00:59.430
You've been up working all night

00:59.466 --> 01:01.633
on Zack's case, haven't you?
Well, yeah.

01:01.668 --> 01:02.901
What choice do I have?

01:02.936 --> 01:04.302
His hearing is in two weeks.

01:04.337 --> 01:06.082
You and Cam threw out
the only evidence we have

01:06.106 --> 01:08.072
that would exonerate him.
Well, we threw it out

01:08.108 --> 01:09.607
because your evidence
was suspect.

01:09.643 --> 01:12.944
Do you really think that I would
falsify my work?

01:12.979 --> 01:15.513
For a friend... yes.

01:15.548 --> 01:18.883
I am telling you that Zack's
microbial signature

01:18.919 --> 01:20.752
showed up nowhere on
the lobbyist's remains.

01:20.787 --> 01:22.253
That doesn't matter.

01:22.289 --> 01:24.355
Absence of evidence
is not proof of innocence.

01:24.391 --> 01:26.524
- You know that as well as anyone.
- Fine. Good.

01:26.559 --> 01:29.060
Yeah. Well, at least
I'm doing something, so.

01:29.095 --> 01:31.596
I see.

01:31.631 --> 01:34.165
You're implying that in the
weeks since my father's death

01:34.200 --> 01:36.501
- I have not committed myself...
- No, no, no, no.

01:36.536 --> 01:38.369
Doc-- Dr. Brennan, wait, please.
That...

01:38.405 --> 01:40.505
that's not what I meant.

01:40.540 --> 01:42.807
Dr. Hodgins, I assure you

01:42.842 --> 01:45.376
I have examined
every piece of evidence

01:45.412 --> 01:47.278
at least a dozen times.

01:47.314 --> 01:50.114
And as much
as it pains me

01:50.150 --> 01:54.519
to say... Zack's sentence
will not be overturned.

01:54.554 --> 01:57.255
Now, we have a body

01:57.290 --> 02:00.391
being brought in
that needs our attention.

02:02.796 --> 02:04.495
Dr. Hodgins...

02:04.531 --> 02:07.699
Yep.
(sighs)

02:10.770 --> 02:12.837
Okay, guys.

02:12.872 --> 02:16.474
You can drop it
right over there.

02:16.509 --> 02:18.476
HODGINS:
Wow.

02:18.511 --> 02:20.845
Talk about a...
a roll in the hay.

02:20.880 --> 02:23.081
What? It's too early?

02:23.116 --> 02:24.860
I don't think time of day
is really the issue.

02:24.884 --> 02:27.251
Dr. Hodgins, if you're done
making sophomoric puns,

02:27.287 --> 02:28.664
I need your help extricating
the remains.

02:28.688 --> 02:30.154
Pretty fresh.

02:30.190 --> 02:31.202
Do we have any idea
what happened?

02:31.226 --> 02:31.991
Not a clue,

02:31.992 --> 02:34.025
except the farmer that was
operating this thing

02:34.060 --> 02:36.594
didn't see the body until
it was folded end over end,

02:36.629 --> 02:38.007
then spit out of this baler.
BRENNAN: Okay.

02:38.031 --> 02:40.431
This set of remains
has been pulverized.

02:40.467 --> 02:41.766
Given the sheer magnitude

02:41.801 --> 02:43.735
of the task before us,

02:43.770 --> 02:47.005
- I need an intern immediately.
- Already on it.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.185
I was just waiting till
the sun came up to call someone.

02:49.209 --> 02:51.943
But who needs
a full night's sleep?

02:51.978 --> 02:53.011
Not me.

02:53.046 --> 02:54.879
Well, that is
patently false.

02:54.914 --> 02:57.782
Studies show
that sleep deprivation

02:57.817 --> 02:59.083
greatly diminishes
productivity.

02:59.119 --> 03:00.296
Okay. So do you want me to wait

03:00.320 --> 03:01.519
before I call someone?

03:01.554 --> 03:03.287
What I want is assistance,

03:03.323 --> 03:05.390
if that's not too much trouble.

03:05.425 --> 03:09.060
Of course. I will...

03:09.095 --> 03:12.063
get right on it.

03:13.199 --> 03:14.432

AUBREY: <i>Booth, you got a visitor,</i>
<i>and, uh,</i>

03:18.271 --> 03:20.004
FYI, he brought some
tiny cakes with him.

03:20.040 --> 03:22.218
Uh, they're petits fours
rather than cakes, Agent Aubrey.

03:22.242 --> 03:24.286
AUBREY: Whatever they're called,
they look delicious.

03:24.310 --> 03:26.110
Hey.
(groans)

03:26.146 --> 03:27.812
Uh, just a little
back thing.

03:27.847 --> 03:30.148
Double-G. Glad you
could make it.

03:30.183 --> 03:31.783
Agent Booth.
Anything

03:31.818 --> 03:33.484
for an old friend.
Well, I got to say

03:33.520 --> 03:35.853
it's an honor to finally meet
<i>the</i> Dr. Gordon Wyatt.

03:35.889 --> 03:37.366
Booth says you're one hell
of a shrink,

03:37.390 --> 03:39.390
maybe an even a better cook.
Well, thank you.

03:39.426 --> 03:41.926
And now that I've earned
my first Michelin star,

03:41.961 --> 03:43.706
I feel that I've earned
the right to be called...

03:43.730 --> 03:44.178
Chef.

03:44.202 --> 03:46.202
Oh. My apologies,
Chef Dr. Wyatt.

03:46.766 --> 03:48.266
Just call him Gordon Gordon.

03:48.301 --> 03:51.035
Agent Booth, um, while I'm
absolutely delighted

03:51.071 --> 03:53.704
to be freed from the, uh,
sweltering confines

03:53.740 --> 03:56.908
of a kitchen, you do know that
I-I haven't really practiced

03:56.943 --> 03:58.276
any psychiatry for some time.

03:58.311 --> 03:59.555
Oh, come on. It's just
like riding a bike.

03:59.579 --> 04:01.023
All right? Plus,
I need you, all right?

04:01.047 --> 04:02.491
Sweets said that you were
the only one

04:02.515 --> 04:03.848
he trusted with his files, so.

04:03.883 --> 04:06.851
Yes. Poor Sweets.

04:06.886 --> 04:09.353
And I take it those are
Dr. Sweets' session notes--

04:09.389 --> 04:11.889
All of them with-with Dr. Addy?
AUBREY: Yes.

04:11.925 --> 04:13.536
Booth and I already read through
all of them

04:13.560 --> 04:16.260
hoping to find something
that could exonerate Zack.

04:16.296 --> 04:18.995
But, uh, we could definitely use
someone of your expertise.

04:19.031 --> 04:20.898
Um, Agent Aubrey,
if you were to yield

04:20.934 --> 04:22.767
to your desire,
rather than fight it,

04:22.802 --> 04:25.303
I think you might be able to
return to the matter in hand.

04:25.338 --> 04:26.838
Is it that obvious?
You're drooling

04:26.873 --> 04:28.806
like a Great Dane.
I'll take that.

04:28.842 --> 04:30.441
(groans)
They're for me.

04:30.477 --> 04:32.021
Please, gentlemen,
don't fight over them.

04:32.045 --> 04:33.744
There are plenty to go 'round.

04:33.780 --> 04:35.146
Plenty.
WYATT: Share.

04:35.181 --> 04:37.482
Good children share, don't they?

04:37.517 --> 04:39.984
BRENNAN: Based on the prominent
occipital protuberance,

04:40.019 --> 04:41.853
the victim is male.

04:41.888 --> 04:44.489
Okay, but given that
half the skull is MIA,

04:44.524 --> 04:47.425
I wouldn't count on
an ID any time soon.

04:47.460 --> 04:50.561
Dr. Saroyan, again I must ask;
I need assistance.

04:50.597 --> 04:52.497
Yes, I heard you
the first ten times,

04:52.532 --> 04:54.232
and Rodolfo
is on his way.

04:54.267 --> 04:56.634
Angela, until he arrives,

04:56.669 --> 04:59.337
will you please help us
with the recovery?

04:59.372 --> 05:00.805
Me?

05:00.840 --> 05:03.007
Yes. You.

05:03.042 --> 05:04.375
Uh, yeah. Okay.

05:04.410 --> 05:05.810
Whatever you need,
honey.

05:05.845 --> 05:07.612
Hey, Angie, do me a favor,

05:07.647 --> 05:09.480
You find any more of these,
you let me know.

05:09.516 --> 05:12.316
Uh. Eww.
What is that?

05:12.352 --> 05:13.918
That is an <i>ascaris lumbricoides.</i>

05:13.953 --> 05:16.020
It's a parasitic roundworm.

05:16.055 --> 05:17.155
Yeah. And the good news

05:17.190 --> 05:19.290
is this guy is still alive.
Okay.

05:19.325 --> 05:21.659
I am so canceling that hay ride
with Michael Vincent.

05:21.694 --> 05:23.127
BRENNAN:
Angela, I assure you

05:23.163 --> 05:25.963
the worm is not indigenous
to the hay.

05:25.999 --> 05:27.932
It most likely came from
within the victim

05:27.967 --> 05:29.400
and vacated after death.
Whoa.

05:29.435 --> 05:32.103
Vacated, you mean,
like came out of his...

05:32.138 --> 05:34.672
Okay. This is so much worse
than I thought.

05:34.707 --> 05:36.541
Hey, Cam, take a look
at this guy.

05:36.576 --> 05:38.409
More often than not
you find worms like this

05:38.444 --> 05:40.578
in impoverished
rural populations.

05:40.613 --> 05:43.281
Is it just me or does
this guy look desiccated?

05:43.316 --> 05:45.761
Well, yeah, he probably left his
human hotel five, six days ago

05:45.785 --> 05:47.251
and has been
starving ever since.

05:47.287 --> 05:49.031
Which would give us
approximate time of death.

05:49.055 --> 05:50.688
Yeah.
BRENNAN: The bone osteons

05:50.723 --> 05:54.358
in the femur are large
but sparse,

05:54.394 --> 05:56.027
which suggests the victim

05:56.062 --> 05:58.763
was in his late teens
to early twenties.

05:58.798 --> 06:01.899
So we're looking at a poor,

06:01.935 --> 06:03.668
younger man
from a rural area?

06:03.703 --> 06:05.548
HODGINS: Probably some local farmer kid
who got drunk,

06:05.572 --> 06:07.738
wandered into the field
and just passed out.

06:07.774 --> 06:09.740
MONTENEGRO:
Yeah. Maybe, but then,

06:09.776 --> 06:13.411
why was he wearing this?
Is that a ski mask?

06:13.446 --> 06:15.391
Well, temperatures in northern
Virginia can drop below freezing

06:15.415 --> 06:16.215
this time of year.

06:16.239 --> 06:17.182
HODGINS: Yeah, true, but if
you're so sensitive

06:17.183 --> 06:18.916
to cold the field
isn't necessarily

06:18.952 --> 06:20.129
the best place to hit the hay.

06:20.153 --> 06:23.354
Really?
That one was an accident.

06:23.389 --> 06:24.755
I promise.
MONTENEGRO: Uh, guys.

06:24.791 --> 06:26.924
I don't think the victim
was wearing a ski mask

06:26.960 --> 06:28.893
because he was chilly.

58 armed robberies
in the tristate area

07:08.720 --> 07:10.753
during the week
that the victim was killed.

07:10.788 --> 07:12.561
How many involved
a handgun...

07:12.585 --> 07:13.779
Yeah, 19.

make yourself at home...
Those are cookies.

07:30.096 --> 07:32.296
Booth, go easy. He's gonna
stop making us snacks.

07:32.332 --> 07:34.332
Did you find anything at all?
What I have

07:34.367 --> 07:37.368
is an an inchoate, nebulous
glimmering of a case,

07:37.403 --> 07:41.372
which involves secret societies,
cannibalistic rituals,

07:41.407 --> 07:43.574
and a brilliant young
forensic anthropologist

07:43.610 --> 07:46.744
who was coerced into a plot
he didn't fully comprehend.

07:46.780 --> 07:48.246
Right. Okay, so you found
nothing

07:48.281 --> 07:49.947
in Sweets' notebook?
My dear fellows,

07:49.983 --> 07:52.016
that's what I'm endeavoring
to ascertain.

07:52.051 --> 07:54.452
Why don't we endeavor
to find you a new office?

07:54.487 --> 07:55.853
Shall we?

07:55.889 --> 07:57.366
- All right.
- All right? You'll love it.

07:57.390 --> 07:59.524
You want me to...
No, no. No.

07:59.559 --> 08:01.025
No. No.
No Bobby?

08:01.060 --> 08:02.304
No, no. It stays here.
Thank you.

08:02.328 --> 08:05.029
Don't... touch.
Okay.

08:05.064 --> 08:07.899
Thank you
for coming in.

08:07.934 --> 08:10.334
So we need a-an
assembled skull,

08:10.370 --> 08:11.536
like, yesterday.

08:11.571 --> 08:13.604
Yeah. Give me
an hour, tops.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.273
You have 20 minutes,
or I think Brennan

08:15.308 --> 08:16.541
is gonna have
an aneurism.

08:16.576 --> 08:17.875
She just lost her father.

08:17.911 --> 08:19.510
I think her crankiness
is just a symptom

08:19.546 --> 08:21.112
of her grief.
Yeah. I know.

08:21.147 --> 08:23.548
I just-- I wish there
was something we could do.

08:24.517 --> 08:25.616
Hey. Have you found an ID?

08:25.652 --> 08:26.884
Uh, not since
I just finished

08:26.920 --> 08:28.519
putting on my gloves.
Yeah, well,

08:28.555 --> 08:30.132
I might have something.
I got the results

08:30.156 --> 08:31.589
from the victim's tox screen.

08:31.624 --> 08:33.491
No drugs, no alcohol,
but his blood

08:33.525 --> 08:35.960
did test positive for saline.
MONTENEGRO: Saline?

08:35.995 --> 08:37.628
Like contact solution?

08:37.664 --> 08:40.631
Well, uh, that could suggest a
double red blood cell donation.

08:40.667 --> 08:41.722
Double red cell?

08:41.724 --> 08:42.898
Yeah. It's a rare
type of donation.

08:42.902 --> 08:45.937
I do it myself, but you can
only give every four months.

08:45.972 --> 08:48.539
Yeah. I'll talk to my contact
at the Red Cross.

08:48.575 --> 08:50.308
Since we have the victim's age
and gender,

08:50.343 --> 08:52.343
this could help determine ID.

08:54.005 --> 08:56.005
30 minutes.

08:56.041 --> 08:57.474
(elevator rings)

08:57.509 --> 08:59.776
Dustin Doyle,
22 years old.

08:59.811 --> 09:01.611
He lived alone in
Covington, Virginia.

09:01.646 --> 09:03.012
He's also got
quite the record.

09:03.048 --> 09:04.492
Multiple accounts
of breaking and entering,

09:04.516 --> 09:05.715
petty theft, burglary.

09:05.750 --> 09:08.551
(scoffs)
I see. So because of his past,

09:08.587 --> 09:12.288
you don't think that he's worthy
of a proper investigation.

09:12.324 --> 09:13.784
What? No. I'm just saying that
he had a checkered past.

09:13.785 --> 09:16.660
And I'm saying that just because
somebody has a record

09:16.695 --> 09:17.905
it shouldn't define
who they are.

09:17.929 --> 09:18.896
Dr. Brennan,

09:18.897 --> 09:20.274
just to be clear, you know
that I'm not talking about

09:20.298 --> 09:21.442
your father here, right?
I never said that you were.

09:21.466 --> 09:23.266
Oh, don't let me interrupt.

09:23.301 --> 09:25.268
But I could hardly pass
this gorgeous creature

09:25.303 --> 09:26.536
without saying hello.

09:26.571 --> 09:28.738
Dr. Wyatt.
Mmm.

09:28.773 --> 09:30.106
So good to see you again.

09:30.142 --> 09:32.308
Why are you wandering around
with that cart?

09:32.344 --> 09:33.977
Oh, well, Agent
Booth suggested

09:34.012 --> 09:36.412
I take up residence in
the conference room,

09:36.448 --> 09:37.814
but as you can see,
it's occupied.

09:37.849 --> 09:39.382
AUBREY:
Yeah, sorry about that.

09:39.417 --> 09:41.195
Booth had to go to the
chiropractor to get his back

09:41.219 --> 09:43.253
checked out. I guess
I accidentally double-booked.

09:43.288 --> 09:44.665
That's the victim's
mother in there.

09:44.689 --> 09:46.122
BRENNAN:
I don't understand.

09:46.158 --> 09:50.293
Dr. Wyatt has come all this way
to assist us,

09:50.328 --> 09:52.162
and you and Booth

09:52.197 --> 09:54.497
couldn't find a space
for him to work?

09:54.533 --> 09:56.933
It was a mistake. I-I'm sorry.
It's extremely inconsiderate.

09:56.968 --> 09:58.902
Oh, really,
it's a slight inconvenience.

09:58.937 --> 10:01.104
One that needs
to be remedied immediately.

10:01.139 --> 10:03.206
AUBREY:
I tell you what,

10:03.241 --> 10:04.552
can you just give us a few
minutes and then the room

10:04.576 --> 10:07.343
will be all yours.
Sure.

10:10.348 --> 10:12.649
I just...

10:12.684 --> 10:15.852
I don't understand who could
do something like this.

10:15.887 --> 10:18.555
Dustin never did
anyone any harm.

10:18.590 --> 10:20.690
I know that this is
difficult, Mrs. Doyle,

10:20.725 --> 10:22.703
but can you tell us when
you last saw your son?

10:22.727 --> 10:23.627
I don't know.

10:23.628 --> 10:25.595
Maybe two, three weeks ago.
That job of his

10:25.630 --> 10:27.997
made it hard for him
to get away.

10:28.033 --> 10:29.510
To what job are you referring?
He was just promoted

10:29.534 --> 10:31.801
to the manager
of the Waffle Shack

10:31.836 --> 10:33.436
on Thorndike Street.

10:33.471 --> 10:35.471
Uh, ma'am, I hate to
tell you, but, uh,

10:35.507 --> 10:37.473
our records show
that Dustin was fired

10:37.509 --> 10:38.708
from that job six months ago.

10:38.743 --> 10:40.710
No, you're wrong.

10:40.745 --> 10:43.313
He... he told me
all about that job,

10:43.348 --> 10:45.248
how well he was doing.
BRENNAN: Ms. Doyle,

10:45.283 --> 10:47.317
you have Parkinson's,
don't you?

10:47.352 --> 10:49.018
Yes.

10:49.054 --> 10:50.954
But how could you know?

10:50.989 --> 10:52.255
The stoop of
your shoulders,

10:52.290 --> 10:55.325
the soft tone in
your voice, the...

10:55.360 --> 10:57.093
tremor in your hands.

10:57.128 --> 10:58.995
Most people don't notice.

10:59.030 --> 11:02.398
It... it would be much worse
without my medication.

11:02.434 --> 11:04.133
Mrs. Doyle,
our records

11:04.169 --> 11:06.369
also show that you're
currently not employed.

11:06.404 --> 11:07.837
No.

11:07.872 --> 11:10.707
Dustin is the one
who has been taking care of me.

11:10.742 --> 11:13.610
Prescriptions
like yours could...

11:13.645 --> 11:16.746
cost upwards of $5,000,
$10,000 a month.

11:16.781 --> 11:18.648
Well, like I said...

11:19.584 --> 11:22.085
...Dustin was an angel.

11:23.421 --> 11:25.622
(footsteps approaching)
Dr. Saroyan.

11:25.657 --> 11:27.897
Perfect timing. I believe I
have found something of note.

11:27.926 --> 11:30.026
Ah, what have you got?
Cause of death?

11:30.061 --> 11:32.128
I'm afraid not.
There are perimortem

11:32.163 --> 11:34.330
avulsion fractures
on the inferior margin

11:34.366 --> 11:37.240
of the C5 and the superior
margin of the C6 vertebrae.

11:37.241 --> 11:38.492
So the victim
suffered whiplash.

11:38.516 --> 11:39.403
Yes. That would suggest

11:39.404 --> 11:42.205
that he was in a car crash
within hours of his death.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.607
Interesting. I just received
ballistics on the gun

11:44.643 --> 11:46.175
we found near the body.

11:46.211 --> 11:48.811
It shows that it was fired
and that there was one bullet

11:48.847 --> 11:50.613
missing from the chamber.

11:50.649 --> 11:54.150
So between the car crash and the
fact that Dustin fired his gun,

11:54.185 --> 11:56.085
that should help us
to narrow down

11:56.121 --> 11:57.720
the list of possible robberies.

11:57.756 --> 11:59.322
I'll let Booth know right away.

11:59.357 --> 12:01.424
<i>But</i> before I do...

12:01.459 --> 12:03.593
I have a little something

12:03.628 --> 12:05.461
I'd like to give you.

12:05.497 --> 12:07.163
What is this?

12:07.198 --> 12:09.432
A gift. Um,
you may or may not know,

12:09.467 --> 12:11.901
but we have a tradition
here at the Jeffersonian.

12:14.406 --> 12:16.739
Congratulations!
Oh...

12:16.775 --> 12:18.941
I heard you finished
your doctorate,

12:18.977 --> 12:21.144
making you the first ever
forensic anthropologist

12:21.179 --> 12:22.779
to be certified in both

12:22.814 --> 12:24.547
the United States
and Cuba.

12:24.582 --> 12:27.483
We are so fortunate
to have you, Dr. Fuentes.

12:27.519 --> 12:29.485
Thank you.

12:30.889 --> 12:32.555
(exhales)

12:35.093 --> 12:38.027
Hey, Doc, sorry for
interrupting your workflow,

12:38.063 --> 12:40.007
but this is the biggest
TV screen in the building.

12:40.031 --> 12:42.065
Oh, no, that's fine.
I-I look forward

12:42.100 --> 12:45.034
to a bit of telly-- it'll be
a refreshing palate cleanse

12:45.070 --> 12:47.170
after all
the cannibalistic feasting

12:47.205 --> 12:49.739
that I've had to consume. So,

12:49.774 --> 12:51.541
what are we watching?
A bank robbery.

12:51.576 --> 12:53.209
Ooh, goody!
Okay,

12:53.244 --> 12:56.546
so of the 15 unsolved bank
robberies committed last week,

12:56.581 --> 12:59.315
I couldn't find any
where gunfire was exchanged,

12:59.351 --> 13:01.184
but I did find one

13:01.219 --> 13:02.919
involving a car crash.

13:02.954 --> 13:04.354
Uh, Bendsville

13:04.389 --> 13:06.122
Savings and Loan--
the bank is located

13:06.157 --> 13:08.224
ten miles from where
the body was found.

13:08.259 --> 13:09.959
MONTENEGRO: Now,
you see the mask?

13:09.994 --> 13:11.928
It matches the one found
on our victim.

13:11.963 --> 13:14.630
And the robber is
approximately the same size

13:14.666 --> 13:16.599
and build as our victim.

13:16.634 --> 13:18.468
WYATT:
Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on,

13:18.503 --> 13:20.002
I was enjoying that.
Oh, I'm just...

13:20.038 --> 13:21.404
skipping ahead
to the good parts.

13:21.439 --> 13:23.239
Now, fortunately,

13:23.274 --> 13:24.741
the Bendsville Police Department

13:24.776 --> 13:26.075
all use dashboard cameras.

13:26.111 --> 13:28.144
(indistinct talking,
tires squealing)

13:28.179 --> 13:30.146
WYATT: I haven't had
this much excitement

13:30.181 --> 13:32.415
since my last
baked Alaska fiasco.

13:32.450 --> 13:35.251
Well, now we know how
Dustin got his whiplash.

13:35.286 --> 13:38.054
I got to say, this guy
drives like a pro.

13:38.089 --> 13:39.789
Yeah, well, look at this.

13:39.824 --> 13:41.858
I was able
to follow the chase

13:41.893 --> 13:43.960
through a series
of security cameras

13:43.995 --> 13:45.762
along Main Street.

13:45.797 --> 13:47.830
WYATT:
Big Brother may be watching,

13:47.866 --> 13:50.099
but he certainly knows
how to make good TV.

13:50.135 --> 13:51.501
AUBREY:
Whoa!

13:51.536 --> 13:52.802
WYATT:
Oh!

13:52.837 --> 13:54.404
Ding, dang, doodle!

13:54.439 --> 13:55.505
I didn't see that coming.

13:55.540 --> 13:56.806
It might have been unexpected,

13:56.841 --> 13:58.841
but this crash
was not an accident.

13:58.877 --> 14:01.477
AUBREY: He timed it perfectly,
running the stop sign.

14:01.513 --> 14:03.479
So that second
car means

14:03.515 --> 14:05.415
that your
fast-driving bank robber

14:05.450 --> 14:07.316
was working with an accomplice.

14:14.391 --> 14:16.270
MAN:
<i>We're a small local bank.</i>

14:16.271 --> 14:17.904
The $60,000 that was taken

14:17.938 --> 14:20.272
is about as much cash
as we ever have on hand.

14:20.307 --> 14:22.854
Think someone on the inside
may have tipped him off?

14:22.878 --> 14:23.776
Oh, no.

14:23.777 --> 14:25.244
Like I told
those TV reporters,

14:25.279 --> 14:27.079
everybody in town knows
that Friday's

14:27.114 --> 14:29.081
when most people cash
their checks.

14:29.116 --> 14:30.949
It doesn't take a genius
to figure out that

14:30.985 --> 14:32.384
that's when we have
the most cash.

14:32.419 --> 14:35.153
Charlene, this is Agent, um...
Aubrey. FBI.

14:35.189 --> 14:38.290
Charlene was our brave
teller who was held up.

14:38.325 --> 14:41.527
I'm sorry, I already spoke
to an agent about the robbery.

14:41.562 --> 14:43.195
Yeah, this is
about a homicide.

14:43.230 --> 14:44.374
The man who robbed you
was murdered.

14:44.398 --> 14:46.231
Does that mean
the money's been recovered?

14:46.267 --> 14:47.533
No, not yet.

14:47.568 --> 14:49.246
Working theory is that
he had an accomplice

14:49.270 --> 14:50.836
that killed him
for his cut.

14:50.871 --> 14:53.305
Now, listen, do either of you
recognize this guy?

14:53.340 --> 14:56.108
Man by the name
of Dustin Doyle?

14:56.143 --> 14:58.410
No. He's certainly
not a customer.

14:58.445 --> 15:01.280
I know every one of them
by name, Agent Audrey.

15:01.315 --> 15:02.781
Aubrey.

15:02.816 --> 15:04.750
This is him.
This is definitely

15:04.785 --> 15:07.119
the man who robbed me.
I can tell.

15:07.154 --> 15:09.187
I remember
he had nice eyes.

15:09.223 --> 15:11.323
Nice eyes?
The guy who held you

15:11.358 --> 15:13.292
at gunpoint?
I know it sounds strange,

15:13.327 --> 15:14.693
but he was kind,

15:14.728 --> 15:16.728
all things considered.
He was calm,

15:16.764 --> 15:19.231
collected, he walked me through
everything I needed to do.

15:19.266 --> 15:23.101
Seems to me like this may not
have been Dustin's first heist.

15:23.137 --> 15:26.838
If it was, he certainly acted
like he knew what he was doing.

15:29.843 --> 15:32.377
(footsteps approaching)

15:33.781 --> 15:35.814
No, Dr. Hodgins, don't get up.

15:35.849 --> 15:37.349
Good Lord,
don't tell me

15:37.384 --> 15:39.685
that you've gone and
joined the Freemasons.

15:39.720 --> 15:41.053
Well, if I did,

15:41.088 --> 15:42.988
I wouldn't reveal it,
now, would I?

15:43.023 --> 15:44.756
(chuckling): It's good
to see you again.

15:44.792 --> 15:46.024
Likewise, my friend.

15:46.060 --> 15:47.993
So to what do I owe this honor?

15:48.028 --> 15:50.796
Hey, I thought you were taking
a stab at Sweets' files there.

15:50.831 --> 15:52.965
Yeah, a dead end,
I'm afraid. But...

15:53.000 --> 15:54.967
by good fortune,
I did get to see

15:55.002 --> 15:57.235
a rather exciting video
of our deceased

15:57.271 --> 15:59.571
bank robber being aided

15:59.607 --> 16:01.006
by an accomplice.

16:01.041 --> 16:03.008
And that got
the little gray cells churning.

16:03.043 --> 16:05.677
Okay, Poirot, what do you got?
Well,

16:05.713 --> 16:08.246
"accomplice" made me
think of "apprentice."

16:08.282 --> 16:11.583
Apprentice as in Gormogon?
Yeah.

16:11.619 --> 16:13.385
Now, correct me if I'm wrong,

16:13.420 --> 16:16.488
but Dr. Addy's assertion
is that he didn't murder anyone,

16:16.923 --> 16:19.891
but that
the previous apprentice killed

16:19.926 --> 16:21.426
the lobbyist.
That's right, yes.

16:21.461 --> 16:23.061
And then Gormogon killed
the apprentice

16:23.096 --> 16:24.896
to make room for Zack.
Killed him

16:24.931 --> 16:26.931
on the exact same night
as the lobbyist, no less.

16:26.967 --> 16:28.833
Wait, hold on a second,
your-your gray cells

16:28.869 --> 16:30.225
are getting me
a little lost here.

16:30.226 --> 16:33.572
Well...
in order to exonerate Dr. Addy,

16:33.607 --> 16:35.940
we need to find
the previous apprentice

16:35.976 --> 16:39.110
and examine his body
for whatever evidence it may

16:39.146 --> 16:41.579
yield up.
The previous apprentice?

16:41.615 --> 16:44.616
Who was murdered and disposed of
God knows where

16:44.651 --> 16:45.432
almost ten years ago.

16:45.456 --> 16:47.420
(chuckling):
Well, unless you've got

16:47.421 --> 16:49.120
a better suggestion...

16:49.156 --> 16:52.290
I say let's start right away.

16:57.064 --> 16:58.663
Dr. Saroyan.

16:58.698 --> 17:01.766
Let me guess-- Dr. Brennan's
asking for the remains.

17:01.802 --> 17:04.002
I'd say insisting
is more accurate.

17:04.037 --> 17:06.337
One... second.

17:06.373 --> 17:08.705
I just found this slug

17:08.742 --> 17:10.842
lodged in the abdominal aorta.

17:10.877 --> 17:12.042
Oh.

17:12.079 --> 17:13.611
Well, judging by the size,

17:13.646 --> 17:15.380
it's a .357 caliber.

17:15.415 --> 17:17.115
Same as the gun we found
on Dustin Doyle.

17:17.150 --> 17:18.394
Stippling on the
abdominal tissue

17:18.417 --> 17:20.218
and an angled
abrasion ring

17:20.252 --> 17:22.287
suggests he was shot
at point-blank range.

17:22.321 --> 17:24.622
But... this is
interesting.

17:24.657 --> 17:26.891
Take a look at
his right hand.

17:27.828 --> 17:29.294
Gunshot residue.

17:29.329 --> 17:30.929
Which could mean
he shot himself.

17:30.964 --> 17:32.430
Not exactly.
I also found

17:32.466 --> 17:34.332
torn ligaments
in the wrist.

17:34.367 --> 17:36.768
So, likely,
there was a struggle,

17:36.803 --> 17:39.404
and the killer turned
the victim's own gun

17:39.439 --> 17:40.338
against him.

17:40.373 --> 17:42.273
Excellent work.
Thank you.

17:42.309 --> 17:44.309
You can take
the remains now.

17:44.344 --> 17:45.710
Okay.

17:46.913 --> 17:49.481
Dr. Fuentes, I can't
help but notice

17:49.516 --> 17:51.683
that you're not wearing
your new jacket.

17:51.718 --> 17:53.418
Did I get the
wrong size?

17:53.453 --> 17:56.154
No, no. No, no, it's perfect.

17:56.189 --> 17:57.989
Thank you again for that.

17:58.024 --> 18:00.024
You don't think you're
getting out of this room

18:00.060 --> 18:01.204
without an explanation, do you?

18:01.228 --> 18:03.561
Mm.
(smacks lips)

18:03.597 --> 18:06.464
As I'm sure you're aware,
there are very few jobs

18:06.500 --> 18:09.167
in the D.C. area
for a forensic anthropologist.

18:09.202 --> 18:11.769
A fact that Arastoo reminds
me of on a daily basis.

18:11.805 --> 18:14.906
Getting my doctorate means
that it's time to move on.

18:14.941 --> 18:16.341
And wearing the jacket

18:16.376 --> 18:18.009
just makes it a little
too real for me.

18:18.044 --> 18:21.779
And the fact that I'll soon
have to leave all of you.

18:21.815 --> 18:23.581
I understand.

18:23.617 --> 18:24.160
(sighs)

18:24.184 --> 18:26.184
But you're still coming
to my wedding, right?

18:26.319 --> 18:28.086
Of course.

18:28.121 --> 18:29.854
We're family.

18:30.824 --> 18:32.557
And I love to party.

18:37.664 --> 18:39.330
Hey, got something
you should look at.

18:39.366 --> 18:41.566
Oh, how's the back?
Yeah, you know, I just got

18:41.601 --> 18:43.813
a slight adjustment, but then
it just moves the pain around.

18:43.837 --> 18:44.877
I'll be okay.
What do you have?

18:44.901 --> 18:45.905
Okay. Uh,

18:45.906 --> 18:48.173
this is surveillance footage
from the bank's parking lot

18:48.208 --> 18:50.241
on the days leading up
to the robbery.

18:50.277 --> 18:51.609
That's Dustin's car.

18:51.645 --> 18:53.244
Yep. He was
casing the joint

18:53.280 --> 18:54.924
for two, three days,
which the bank manager

18:54.948 --> 18:56.881
might have noticed
if he ever reviewed his tapes.

18:56.917 --> 18:58.483
What about his accomplice?

18:58.518 --> 19:00.852
Nothing yet, but I'll keep
looking. Hey, by the way,

19:00.887 --> 19:02.598
where did Gordon Gordon
run off to? Little...

19:02.622 --> 19:04.689
soufflé emergency?
No, I sent him off to the lab

19:04.724 --> 19:06.057
to compare notes with Hodgins.

19:06.092 --> 19:07.592
What's that you're
working on?

19:07.627 --> 19:09.627
Credit card statements.
Our victim stayed

19:09.663 --> 19:11.329
in these
hole-in-the-wall motels

19:11.364 --> 19:12.597
once a month.

19:12.632 --> 19:14.098
Penhook, Virginia.

19:14.134 --> 19:15.900
Bittenger, Maryland.
Yeah.

19:15.936 --> 19:17.155
Mocksville, North Carolina.

19:17.179 --> 19:18.304
In each of these towns,
there was

19:18.305 --> 19:20.305
a bank robbery
while Dustin was <i>there.</i>

19:20.340 --> 19:22.106
So what I want you to do
is I want you

19:22.142 --> 19:24.042
to call the motels,
right, and get a list

19:24.077 --> 19:26.010
of all the other guests
that were staying there

19:26.046 --> 19:27.545
while Dustin was staying there,

19:27.581 --> 19:29.714
and hopefully,
we'll find the...?

19:29.749 --> 19:30.782
Accomplice.
That's it!

19:30.817 --> 19:31.950
Hey.
You're on it.

19:31.985 --> 19:33.685
MONTENEGRO:
So, the accomplice's car

19:33.720 --> 19:35.698
has no license plate on it.
SAROYAN: Yeah, and those windows

19:35.722 --> 19:37.655
are too tinted
to give us an I.D.

19:37.691 --> 19:39.057
What about the car itself?

19:39.092 --> 19:40.992
MONTENEGRO:
Well, it looks like a junker,

19:41.027 --> 19:43.428
like it's just a bunch
of mismatched parts.

19:43.463 --> 19:45.897
Like Frankenstein's monster,
but the car version.

19:45.932 --> 19:48.199
Yes, but the body
from that monster

19:48.235 --> 19:50.368
is from a 1973 Caprice Classic!

19:50.403 --> 19:52.752
That is the largest model Chevy
ever built.

19:52.753 --> 19:53.783
MONTENEGRO: Geez,
I never realized

19:53.807 --> 19:55.506
you knew so much about cars.

19:55.542 --> 19:58.009
Growing up in a country that
banned imported automobiles

19:58.044 --> 20:01.479
after 1959, you tend to
live a rich fantasy life.

20:01.514 --> 20:05.450
Is it me, or do those tires
look too large for that body?

20:05.485 --> 20:07.318
Well, they're
all-terrain, and...

20:07.354 --> 20:10.054
unlike the rest of the car,
they're relatively new.

20:10.090 --> 20:13.358
Wait. That is not
the original bumper.

20:13.393 --> 20:16.728
Okay, uh, let's run a search.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.634
It's from a '77
Cadillac Coupe de Ville.

20:22.669 --> 20:23.768
FUENTES:
Wow.

20:23.803 --> 20:25.670
That is a heavy, strong bumper.

20:25.705 --> 20:27.772
That car may look
like hell on wheels,

20:27.807 --> 20:30.074
but you can't beat it
in terms of toughness.

20:30.110 --> 20:33.045
So whoever this
mysterious road bandit is...

20:33.045 --> 20:36.494
He built a car
ideal for smashing and crashing.

20:36.716 --> 20:39.217
(Fuentes chuckles)

20:41.421 --> 20:44.822
I know I might lose my
James Beard Award if I say this,

20:44.858 --> 20:47.425
but I honestly think
the simple appeal of diner food

20:47.460 --> 20:48.993
is... timeless.

20:49.029 --> 20:50.539
I'll tell you,
I couldn't agree more, Doc.

20:50.563 --> 20:52.930
Well, unfortunately,
both of your meals are...

20:52.966 --> 20:54.499
filled with saturated fats,

20:54.534 --> 20:56.534
which have been
linked to...

20:56.569 --> 20:58.936
heart disease,
high cholesterol and stroke.

20:58.972 --> 21:00.672
Bones, come on,
we're trying to eat here.

21:00.707 --> 21:02.285
I'm just stating a fact.
I understand that you're

21:02.309 --> 21:03.686
stating a fact, but we
haven't seen Gordon Gordon

21:03.710 --> 21:05.276
in a while here.
We may never

21:05.312 --> 21:07.545
see him again
if he dies of a heart attack.

21:07.580 --> 21:09.580
She doesn't mean that.
Yes, I do. I'd appreciate

21:09.616 --> 21:11.349
(phone chimes)
if you didn't speak for me.

21:11.384 --> 21:14.252
Everything all right,
Agent Booth?

21:14.287 --> 21:16.688
No, it's Aubrey-- it turns out
those fleabag motels

21:16.723 --> 21:18.756
that Dustin visited,
they're all booked

21:18.792 --> 21:21.759
with demolition derby competitors.
Heh! I'm hardly surprised,

21:21.795 --> 21:24.395
given the way they were driving
during the getaway.

21:24.431 --> 21:26.264
Wait, what's a demolition derby?
Oh!

21:26.299 --> 21:27.732
Oh! Oh, my dear,

21:27.767 --> 21:29.934
it's the absolute pinnacle
of American culture.

21:29.969 --> 21:31.903
You get these
old junk-boxes slamming

21:31.938 --> 21:34.372
and smashing into each other,
bursting into flames,

21:34.407 --> 21:37.342
until there's only one
vehicle left standing.

21:37.377 --> 21:39.043
(engines roaring)
See? Bam!

21:39.079 --> 21:40.778
BRENNAN:
That is absolutely barbaric.

21:40.814 --> 21:43.214
Okay, come on. Aubrey says
there's one this weekend.

21:43.249 --> 21:46.150
What do you say, you want
to tag along with me, Doc?

21:46.186 --> 21:47.518
I tell you what.
Hmm?

21:47.554 --> 21:50.221
Why don't <i>you</i> both
go undercover

21:50.256 --> 21:51.923
and compete?
Yeah, that's a...

21:51.958 --> 21:53.825
What do you say, Bones?
No!

21:53.860 --> 21:55.059
No, it's too dangerous.

21:55.095 --> 21:56.728
Especially
with your back ailment.

21:56.763 --> 21:58.730
I'll be fine. Okay.
I'll get over it.

21:58.765 --> 22:00.309
I have no interest in
those childish antics.

22:00.333 --> 22:02.066
Fine. I'll just go by myself.

22:02.102 --> 22:04.080
I didn't think you'd want to
drive one of those cars, anyway.

22:04.104 --> 22:05.837
Why? Because I'm a woman?
I didn't say that.

22:05.872 --> 22:07.405
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, no.

22:07.440 --> 22:10.108
On second thought, I order you
both to participate.

22:10.143 --> 22:11.876
On the one hand, you'll
get a better handle

22:11.911 --> 22:13.823
on who Dustin's accomplice
was if you're on the inside,

22:13.847 --> 22:17.181
and on the other hand, I think
the aggression of the derby

22:17.217 --> 22:20.084
will be rather therapeutic
for you, Dr. Brennan.

22:20.120 --> 22:23.287
Therapeutic,
what do you say, Bones?

22:27.160 --> 22:29.727
I'd say that
Buck and Wanda Moosejaw

22:29.763 --> 22:31.042
have some car shopping to do.

22:31.066 --> 22:32.858
Boom! Yeah.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.429
TRACK ANNOUNCER:
Hey. Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.

23:03.024 --> 23:05.291
You ready to kick
some tailpipe ass?

23:05.326 --> 23:06.992
Booth, this is a mistake.

23:07.028 --> 23:08.761
Listen, Bones.
(in Buck character): Yeah.

23:08.796 --> 23:10.326
You got to stay in character
with me, all right?

23:10.327 --> 23:10.937
All right.

23:10.961 --> 23:12.961
- Buck. Honey.
- Yeah. Yep.

23:13.067 --> 23:14.300
This was a mistake.

23:14.335 --> 23:15.568
Honestly,

23:15.603 --> 23:16.880
you think the killer
was stupid enough

23:16.904 --> 23:17.970
to show up here?

23:18.005 --> 23:19.183
Come on,
it's a demolition derby.

23:19.207 --> 23:20.317
Oh. Fair enough.
All right, look.

23:20.341 --> 23:22.041
Just remember what
Gordon Gordon said.

23:22.076 --> 23:23.654
What? That this would
be therapeutic for me?

23:23.678 --> 23:26.111
I find that dubious
to say the least.

23:26.147 --> 23:29.215
Well, take a look around
at the cars and the names

23:29.250 --> 23:31.183
on the cars will
tell us a lot.

23:31.219 --> 23:33.319
I'll keep my eye
out for a car named

23:33.354 --> 23:34.987
Killer Bank Robber
Accomplice.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.388
Bones.

23:36.424 --> 23:38.123
Here. Look, look.
Look at that.

23:38.159 --> 23:39.959
There, right there.
That car there.

23:39.994 --> 23:42.239
BRENNAN: "Filthy Rich." Well, that's a stretch,
BOOTH: Yeah.

23:42.263 --> 23:44.530
but I imagine a bank robber

23:44.565 --> 23:46.832
could name a car that.
Oh, no.

23:46.868 --> 23:48.100
Look at the body, all right?

23:48.135 --> 23:50.569
That's from a '77 Coupe de Ville

23:50.605 --> 23:53.506
and the bumper and the-the doors

23:53.541 --> 23:55.674
are from a '73 Chevy Caprice.
BRENNAN: The two models

23:55.710 --> 23:58.477
that the accomplice's car
was comprised of.

23:58.513 --> 24:00.579
I think we should
go find that driver.

24:00.615 --> 24:05.150
TRACK ANNOUNCER: Be advised, the race
will be starting in five minutes.

24:05.186 --> 24:07.520
Now, to locate
the apprentice's body,

24:07.555 --> 24:09.321
what we need to do first

24:09.357 --> 24:12.558
is to get inside the mind
of Gormogon himself.

24:12.593 --> 24:15.094
You're gonna get into the mind
of a cannibal while eating?

24:15.129 --> 24:17.129
Well, human tastes like chicken.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.031
Okay, one,
that's disgusting.

24:19.066 --> 24:21.267
Two, what if that's
exactly what happened?

24:21.302 --> 24:22.868
What if he just
ate his apprentice?

24:22.904 --> 24:24.637
No, no, no.
I don't think he'd do that.

24:24.672 --> 24:27.673
You see, in Gormogon's eyes,
the apprentice failed him.

24:27.708 --> 24:31.010
He's not as worthy
as our Dr. Addy.

24:31.045 --> 24:32.523
Yeah. Plus, we know that the
body has to be somewhere

24:32.547 --> 24:34.046
in the D.C. area,
because Zack said

24:34.081 --> 24:35.648
when Gormogon left
with the body,

24:35.683 --> 24:37.917
he was only gone
for a few hours.

24:37.952 --> 24:39.718
Yes, but where would he go?

24:39.754 --> 24:41.420
I-I-I don't believe he'd just

24:41.455 --> 24:44.256
deposit him
in some shallow grave.

24:44.292 --> 24:46.692
Like the Masons, Gormogon
was a slave to ritual.

24:46.727 --> 24:47.960
SAROYAN:
Uh, hey.

24:47.995 --> 24:49.962
Sorry to interrupt,
but Dr. Hodgins,

24:49.997 --> 24:51.508
you had something to show me?
Right, yeah.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.933
Cam, so in my initial
examination,

24:53.968 --> 24:57.036
I actually swabbed the victim's
hands and found coconut oil,

24:57.071 --> 24:59.638
argan oil, honey and royal jelly.
WYATT: Ah.

24:59.674 --> 25:01.473
If you added crushed almonds
that would be

25:01.509 --> 25:04.376
a delicious Moroccan dish
called amlou.

25:04.412 --> 25:07.546
Or more likely,
it's a high-end hair oil,

25:07.582 --> 25:11.050
but I found none of that
in the victim's own hair.

25:11.085 --> 25:12.818
Which would suggest
that he put his fingers

25:12.853 --> 25:16.121
in another person's hair
just prior to death.

25:16.157 --> 25:17.323
Huh.

25:17.358 --> 25:19.158
Well, I'll let Booth know.

25:19.193 --> 25:20.459
How are you guys coming?

25:20.494 --> 25:21.927
Swimmingly.

25:21.963 --> 25:23.607
Yeah. Which is the British
stiff upper lip way

25:23.631 --> 25:26.065
of saying
we've got absolutely nothing.

25:28.936 --> 25:30.869
(indistinct chatter)

25:30.905 --> 25:33.138
- Can my sister and I get a selfie?
- Sure.

25:33.174 --> 25:35.641
Thank you.

25:37.311 --> 25:39.445
Thank you so much.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.547
Howdy, look at
what we got here.

25:41.582 --> 25:44.283
Well, you must be Filthy Rich.

25:44.318 --> 25:46.051
Yes, I am.
Yeah.

25:46.087 --> 25:47.219
Thank you for noticing.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.188
I'm Buck. This here,
she's Wanda.

25:49.223 --> 25:50.322
Howdy.

25:50.358 --> 25:51.468
Never seen you
around here before.

25:51.492 --> 25:53.559
Is this your first derby?
Oh.

25:53.594 --> 25:55.961
A good friend of ours told us
about this place.

25:55.997 --> 25:57.896
Dustin Doyle... Yeah.
Dustin?

25:57.932 --> 26:00.405
He sold me some parts
for my ride.

26:00.429 --> 26:02.268
(sniffs)

26:02.269 --> 26:03.647
Are you sniffing my hair?
I was just

26:03.671 --> 26:06.138
curious what kind
of product you use.

26:06.173 --> 26:07.806
(laughing):
No product.

26:07.842 --> 26:10.075
Home recipe.
Mayonnaise based.

26:10.111 --> 26:12.111
It's what gives
it its luster.

26:12.146 --> 26:13.679
Mayonnaise.
BUCK: Now don't judge.

26:13.714 --> 26:14.847
It sounds tasty.

26:14.882 --> 26:16.193
Now I'm gonna give you
some advice.

26:16.217 --> 26:18.050
Does it involve condiments?

26:18.085 --> 26:20.252
There's no colluding

26:20.287 --> 26:22.421
in demolition derby.
You think

26:22.456 --> 26:24.423
because we're married
we're gonna team up?

26:24.458 --> 26:26.525
And because you know Dustin.
That boy's a cheat.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.861
Meaning he's colluded before.

26:28.896 --> 26:30.562
He has a partner?
Ray Kimball.

26:30.598 --> 26:33.165
He and Dustin are
as thick as thieves.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.300
Thick as thieves,
like your hair.

26:36.837 --> 26:40.372
Okay, can you move in closer to
the left temporal, por favor?

26:40.408 --> 26:41.818
All right, see those
two cuts on the bone?

26:41.842 --> 26:43.153
They're approximately
the same size

26:43.177 --> 26:44.643
and they appear
to be parallel.

26:44.679 --> 26:47.546
Suggesting Dustin wasn't
struck in the head twice,

26:47.581 --> 26:50.416
but once with an
object that has

26:50.451 --> 26:53.552
a 1.2 centimeter gap in it.

26:53.587 --> 26:55.198
Okay. Zoom in a little bit
closer, please.

26:55.222 --> 26:57.489
There. Just as I suspected.

26:57.525 --> 27:00.459
Both lines have indentations
with a similar zigzag pattern.

27:00.494 --> 27:02.094
Yeah. I don't,
I don't see it.

27:02.129 --> 27:04.369
Okay. Do me a favor. Pull up
an image of a monkey wrench.

27:04.398 --> 27:05.464
Hey.

27:05.499 --> 27:06.832
FUENTES:
Ta-da.

27:06.867 --> 27:08.500
SAROYAN:
Does this mean

27:08.536 --> 27:10.769
our victim was hit
with a wrench

27:10.805 --> 27:11.970
and shot in the gut?

27:12.006 --> 27:13.772
Well, judging by
hemorrhagic staining,

27:13.808 --> 27:16.275
the blow to the face
predated the gunshot

27:16.310 --> 27:18.143
by at least a few hours.
Busy day.

27:18.179 --> 27:20.646
Beaten and shot
and still had time

27:20.681 --> 27:22.225
to run his fingers through
a woman's hair.

27:22.249 --> 27:23.749
FUENTES:
Well, actually,

27:23.784 --> 27:25.395
I am not so sure that it was
a woman's hair

27:25.419 --> 27:28.087
he was holding.
The plot thickens.

27:28.122 --> 27:30.122
Well, it's not what you think.
We ran a simulation.

27:30.157 --> 27:31.790
A simulation of a man

27:31.826 --> 27:33.537
rubbing another man's hair.
FUENTES: Not exactly.

27:33.561 --> 27:35.694
I found bone bruising
on the victim's left patella.

27:35.730 --> 27:38.097
MONTENEGRO:
The move was a Muay Thai

27:38.132 --> 27:39.264
knee strike.
Pow.

27:39.300 --> 27:40.432
Ooh.
That looks painful.

27:40.468 --> 27:41.567
Well, not just painful.

27:41.602 --> 27:43.502
A blow like that
would leave bruising

27:43.537 --> 27:45.248
that should still be evident.
I'll let Aubrey know.

27:45.272 --> 27:47.306
He should be
at the derby by now.

27:47.341 --> 27:50.209
Whoa. Aubrey went
undercover, too?

27:50.244 --> 27:52.022
He's not driving, but I'm sure
whatever he's doing,

27:52.046 --> 27:54.613
he's fully committed
to the part.

27:58.018 --> 28:00.652
(phone rings)

28:00.688 --> 28:01.987
Hello.

28:02.022 --> 28:05.090
Cam. Hey, sorry.
I'm, uh...

28:05.126 --> 28:07.526
So what are you eating?
Funnel cake or a corn dog?

28:07.561 --> 28:09.239
It's, uh, more of a hybrid,
actually. Little bit of both.

28:09.263 --> 28:10.496
What do you got?

28:10.531 --> 28:12.064
Our victim struck
his attacker hard,

28:12.099 --> 28:13.565
so be on the lookout...
Thanks.

28:13.601 --> 28:14.945
...for anyone with bruising
on their face.

28:14.969 --> 28:17.636
Bruising on the face.
Hold on a second.

28:17.671 --> 28:19.171
(car engine revving)

28:19.206 --> 28:21.640
I just located Ray Kimball,
the driver

28:21.675 --> 28:23.208
that Dustin Doyle
was colluding with.

28:23.232 --> 28:23.943
Well, be careful.

28:23.944 --> 28:25.711
From what we can tell,
he struck our victim

28:25.746 --> 28:27.324
with a monkey wrench
before shooting him.

28:27.348 --> 28:28.514
Will do. Thanks.

28:28.549 --> 28:30.616
(engines revving)
Hey.

28:30.651 --> 28:31.850
Hey, man.

28:31.886 --> 28:33.385
How you doing?

28:33.420 --> 28:35.254
Big, big fan.
I got to tell you.

28:35.289 --> 28:37.990
That is one hell of a ride
you got there.

28:38.025 --> 28:39.491
Dude. What are you doing, man?

28:39.527 --> 28:40.692
Get your food off my car.

28:40.728 --> 28:43.529
Ooh. Nice set of tools, too.

28:43.564 --> 28:45.597
There blood on that wrench?

28:45.633 --> 28:47.444
Bro, I don't know who the hell
you think you are,

28:47.468 --> 28:49.768
but if you don't pick that up,
there's gonna be

28:49.804 --> 28:51.148
a hell of a lot more blood
on this wrench.

28:51.172 --> 28:53.438
Put it down. You
don't want to do that.

28:53.474 --> 28:55.440
(scoffs)

28:56.644 --> 28:58.043
(grunts)

28:58.078 --> 28:59.511
You got a dent in your car.

28:59.547 --> 29:01.814
More bad news,
you're under arrest, pal.

29:05.842 --> 29:07.485
All right, Ray.
Why don't you take a seat?

29:07.485 --> 29:10.452
I need to ask you
a few questions.

29:10.488 --> 29:12.888
No, man.
This ain't right.

29:12.923 --> 29:15.357
You didn't tell me you were FBI.
So what, you're saying

29:15.393 --> 29:16.892
it's okay to swing a wrench
at a guy,

29:16.927 --> 29:18.260
as long as he's not
in the bureau?

29:18.295 --> 29:20.229
You mean like you did
with Dustin Doyle.

29:21.932 --> 29:22.985
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:23.009 --> 29:23.767
You know what I think?

29:23.768 --> 29:27.436
I think that something went
wrong at your last heist.

29:27.471 --> 29:28.771
What?

29:28.806 --> 29:31.407
No. Heist?

29:31.442 --> 29:33.275
- I don't even know what that is.
- Come on.

29:33.310 --> 29:34.821
You don't know what a heist is?
It's like a robbery.

29:34.845 --> 29:37.079
- You know what a robbery is, right?
- Yes.

29:37.114 --> 29:40.315
I mean... not firsthand
or nothing.

29:40.351 --> 29:42.151
Look. This is just

29:42.186 --> 29:44.520
a big misunderstanding, okay?

29:44.555 --> 29:45.921
I mean, maybe I hit Dustin,

29:45.956 --> 29:48.157
but if he's saying
that I heisted a bank...

29:48.192 --> 29:50.659
No. Dustin isn't saying
anything, Ray. Dustin's dead.

29:53.164 --> 29:54.430
I don't believe you.

29:54.465 --> 29:55.998
I think you're
trying to trick me.

29:56.033 --> 29:57.611
Ray, I could trick you
by pretend throwing a ball

29:57.635 --> 29:59.168
and palming it in my hand.

29:59.203 --> 30:01.336
Now, you didn't know that Dustin
was dead, did you?

30:02.840 --> 30:04.406
You're scared.

30:04.442 --> 30:05.808
I'm not scared.

30:07.912 --> 30:10.813
But I'm not saying
another word.

30:10.848 --> 30:12.781
Not until I speak with a lawyer.

30:18.389 --> 30:19.888
Damn it.

30:19.924 --> 30:21.857
We have been
at this all day.

30:21.892 --> 30:23.559
We've got
absolutely nothing.

30:23.594 --> 30:26.628
If you don't watch
your anger, Dr. Hodgins,

30:26.664 --> 30:28.163
I have a good mind
to send you off

30:28.199 --> 30:30.466
to the demolition derby, too.
Sorry. It's just

30:30.501 --> 30:32.183
I promised Zack I
wouldn't let him down.

30:32.184 --> 30:35.005
You know, I-I've been thinking
about you said regarding

30:35.039 --> 30:37.039
Gormogon's love-hate
relationship

30:37.074 --> 30:38.507
with the Freemasons.

30:38.542 --> 30:42.744
What if he did
bury his apprentice

30:42.780 --> 30:44.379
according to Masonic ritual?

30:44.415 --> 30:45.992
Gormogon wouldn't do that
because the apprentice

30:46.016 --> 30:47.816
betrayed him.
No, no, no, no.

30:47.852 --> 30:52.421
He wouldn't dispose of the body
with any kind of reverence,

30:52.456 --> 30:54.289
but what if he employed
some Masonic ritual

30:54.325 --> 30:56.658
that symbolized betrayal?

30:56.694 --> 30:59.862
The apprentice was a traitor,
so-so he didn't put his bones

30:59.897 --> 31:02.231
in the, uh,
Widow's Son skeleton.

31:02.266 --> 31:04.132
Maybe...
Hmm. He also didn't eat them

31:04.168 --> 31:07.703
because, you know, to him, he
was basically poisonous, so...

31:07.738 --> 31:09.104
(gasps)

31:09.139 --> 31:10.439
Th-that's it.

31:10.474 --> 31:12.441
It's the acacia tree.

31:12.476 --> 31:15.544
No. Th-the acacia tree
surely symbolizes, uh,

31:15.579 --> 31:16.979
the immortality
of the soul.

31:17.014 --> 31:19.882
Yes. It does that,
but also the acacia itself

31:19.917 --> 31:21.517
is inedible and poisonous,

31:21.552 --> 31:23.151
which is the
perfect symbol

31:23.187 --> 31:24.953
for a poisonous,
outcast apprentice.

31:24.989 --> 31:26.221
So if we can identify

31:26.257 --> 31:29.124
all the acacia trees
in the local area,

31:29.159 --> 31:32.895
then it's possible that
the apprentice will be buried

31:32.930 --> 31:35.230
in close proximity.

31:35.266 --> 31:38.033
Yeah.
Oh.

31:38.068 --> 31:41.370
I like it.
(laughs)

31:41.405 --> 31:43.316
So I just finished testing the
blood on Ray Kimball's wrench.

31:43.340 --> 31:44.873
It definitely came
from the victim.

31:44.909 --> 31:46.186
Was Aubrey able
to get a confession?

31:46.210 --> 31:47.376
No. I just spoke to him.

31:47.411 --> 31:50.212
He said Ray Kimball
seemed genuinely shocked

31:50.247 --> 31:52.347
to hear Dustin was dead,
and that he seemed scared.

31:52.383 --> 31:54.683
I am not surprised, given
the evidence I found.

31:54.718 --> 31:57.886
Look at the humeral head
of the victim's right arm.

31:57.922 --> 31:59.521
- Is that an avulsion fracture?
- Yes.

31:59.557 --> 32:01.189
And there's a
corresponding fracture

32:01.225 --> 32:02.558
on the left
humerus as well.

32:02.593 --> 32:04.927
SAROYAN :
Which means Dustin's arms

32:04.962 --> 32:06.929
were likely pulled
backwards and held there.

32:06.964 --> 32:08.174
Which explains the lack
of defensive wounds.

32:08.198 --> 32:09.498
Dustin couldn't fight back

32:09.533 --> 32:10.844
because someone was
holding his arms.

32:10.868 --> 32:12.768
Well, and if that was done
at the same time

32:12.803 --> 32:14.236
Ray hit his face
with a wrench...

32:14.271 --> 32:15.604
It points to
a second accomplice.

32:15.639 --> 32:18.574
(chuckles)

32:25.683 --> 32:27.549
Hey, Wanda.

32:27.585 --> 32:29.351
I just got off the
phone with Cam, okay?

32:29.386 --> 32:31.331
She's saying it's likely that
Ray has another partner.

32:31.355 --> 32:33.455
What do you mean, "likely"?
Likely, I mean...

32:33.490 --> 32:35.724
Listen. Aubrey agrees, man.
Ray was really scared

32:35.759 --> 32:37.037
in interrogation. Booth,
I don't want to be here.

32:37.061 --> 32:38.204
I need to get back to the lab.

32:38.228 --> 32:39.595
Nope. Come on.
We got to get going.

32:39.630 --> 32:41.063
The derby's gonna
be starting soon.

32:41.098 --> 32:42.864
Why?

32:42.900 --> 32:46.101
The whole reason we're here
is to solve a case, not to...

32:46.136 --> 32:48.737
pointlessly smash into cars.
All right, look,

32:48.772 --> 32:51.206
my gut is telling me that
we can still find this guy,

32:51.241 --> 32:53.153
that he's out here, all right?
So Gordon Gordon says

32:53.177 --> 32:54.810
it's good for you, too.
Booth.

32:54.845 --> 32:56.812
What?
Demolition derby's not therapy.

32:56.847 --> 32:59.881
It is idiotic and...
and dangerous!

32:59.917 --> 33:02.183
Especially when
you have a hurt back.

33:02.207 --> 33:02.819
Look, my back's fine.

33:02.820 --> 33:04.786
All right?
Look, and these...

33:04.822 --> 33:07.456
these cars are built to
protect you, all right?

33:07.491 --> 33:09.191
Everything's gonna
be fine. Trust me.

33:09.226 --> 33:10.525
All right?

33:10.561 --> 33:11.893
Come on, Bone Crusher.

33:11.929 --> 33:13.395
Get in there, Wanda.

33:13.430 --> 33:15.397
Come on, Wanda-tanda
from Buffalo.

33:15.432 --> 33:17.666
She gonna take
you down, Mad Dog.

33:20.204 --> 33:22.771
Okay, so this is what
you're looking for.

33:22.806 --> 33:26.541
This is a present-day map
of Washington, D.C.

33:26.577 --> 33:29.511
And here are the
original boundary lines

33:29.546 --> 33:31.647
from 1792,

33:31.682 --> 33:34.683
before Virginia reacquired
everything west of the Potomac.

33:34.718 --> 33:36.652
That seems to be
a sort of perfect,

33:36.687 --> 33:37.524
symmetrical diamond.

33:37.548 --> 33:38.621
HODGINS: That's because
the architect of D.C.,

33:38.622 --> 33:40.255
Pierre L'Enfant,
was a Freemason,

33:40.290 --> 33:42.124
and the rhombus is a key symbol.

33:42.159 --> 33:43.959
Excuse me.
Oh, Agent Aubrey.

33:43.994 --> 33:46.361
Look, I hope this isn't
a food-related matter,

33:46.397 --> 33:47.663
because, uh,

33:47.698 --> 33:48.797
it's not a good time.

33:48.832 --> 33:50.032
I'm busy looking
for trees.

33:50.067 --> 33:51.933
What?
HODGINS: Acacia trees.

33:51.969 --> 33:53.902
Angie's plotting
all the acacia trees in D.C.

33:53.937 --> 33:55.837
in case the apprentice
is buried underneath.

33:55.873 --> 33:57.839
Well, that's great,
but believe it or not,

33:57.875 --> 33:59.474
that's not what
I was calling about.

33:59.510 --> 34:01.843
Uh, listen, Doc, I need
your help breaking a suspect.

34:01.879 --> 34:03.712
Booth says that you got
wicked, Jedi-like

34:03.747 --> 34:05.047
ninja powers or something?

34:05.082 --> 34:06.415
MONTENEGRO (chuckling):
Why?

34:06.450 --> 34:08.750
Is the suspect some kind
of, uh, evil genius?

34:08.786 --> 34:10.185
No. He's an idiot,

34:10.219 --> 34:11.987
but there's no way
that he's gonna talk.

34:12.022 --> 34:13.255
WYATT:
All right.

34:13.290 --> 34:14.489
Well, if you'd give me

34:14.525 --> 34:16.391
a moment to
think, yeah?

34:16.427 --> 34:18.237
Well, do it fast, 'cause this
derby's about to start,

34:18.262 --> 34:20.373
and my guess is, by the time
it's over the second accomplice

34:20.397 --> 34:21.563
is gonna be as good as gone.

34:21.598 --> 34:23.065
Angie, would you
do me a favor

34:23.100 --> 34:24.777
and focus on the western side
of the old map?

34:24.802 --> 34:26.333
Okay. Why?

34:26.370 --> 34:27.902
Well, the Freemasons, the west,

34:27.938 --> 34:29.549
with the setting sun represented
finished projects

34:29.572 --> 34:31.739
and death.
Um, Agent Aubrey,

34:31.775 --> 34:34.076
I think I have a solution
for you-- you should

34:34.110 --> 34:35.143
let the idiot go free.

34:35.179 --> 34:36.445
What? No.

34:36.480 --> 34:38.080
At minimum,
the guy's an accessory.

34:38.114 --> 34:39.313
Which is why you should

34:39.349 --> 34:40.748
keep him in your sight,

34:40.784 --> 34:43.485
but first let him lead you
to his partner in crime.

34:44.621 --> 34:46.321
Okay.
(sighs)

34:46.356 --> 34:48.322
Here goes nothing.

34:51.261 --> 34:52.893
(crowd cheering)

34:57.067 --> 35:00.569
What do you say there,
Wanda Bone Crusher, baby?

35:01.505 --> 35:03.438
Hey, Bones, come on.

35:03.474 --> 35:05.107
We got this.

35:05.142 --> 35:06.808
Love you.

35:07.978 --> 35:09.422
MAN: Come on, man!
No more sandbagging

35:09.446 --> 35:11.713
this time, you hear?
Ha-ha!

35:11.749 --> 35:14.382
I'm gonna Mad Dog
all over you, buddy!

35:14.418 --> 35:16.518
(phone ringing)

35:17.988 --> 35:19.621
BOOTH:
This is not a good time.

35:19.656 --> 35:21.423
Booth, I let Ray Kimball go.

35:21.458 --> 35:22.257
What?

35:22.281 --> 35:23.626
AUBREY: Gordon Gordon said
he would lead us

35:23.627 --> 35:24.593
to the other accomplice.

35:24.628 --> 35:27.162
He's making a phone call
as we speak.

35:28.732 --> 35:29.732
Right. Okay.

35:29.767 --> 35:31.066
What's going on, Booth?
Bones,

35:31.101 --> 35:32.579
take a look around
at the other drivers.

35:32.603 --> 35:34.047
See if anyone picks up
their telephone.

35:34.071 --> 35:35.771
(phone rings)

35:35.806 --> 35:36.772
Yeah?

35:36.807 --> 35:37.939
(whispering):
Booth. Booth.

35:37.975 --> 35:40.108
Over there.

35:40.144 --> 35:41.209
In the Big Belly car.

35:41.245 --> 35:44.045
TRACK ANNOUNCER:
Okay, everyone, here we go.

35:44.081 --> 35:45.547
Get your helmets on!

35:46.784 --> 35:50.152
All right, drivers,
start your engines!

35:50.187 --> 35:51.520
(engines revving)

35:53.791 --> 35:57.025
Let's count it down, folks.
Take it from five...

35:57.060 --> 35:58.126
four...

35:58.162 --> 35:59.494
three...

35:59.530 --> 36:00.862
two...

36:00.898 --> 36:02.798
one. Let's derby!

36:02.833 --> 36:06.034
BRENNAN:
<i>Booth, don't let him get away!</i>

36:15.379 --> 36:16.745
(grunts)

36:16.780 --> 36:18.880
(indistinct shouts)

36:18.916 --> 36:20.816
(laughing)

36:29.026 --> 36:30.525
<i>Booth, look! He's trying</i>

36:30.561 --> 36:31.827
to get off the track!

36:33.864 --> 36:36.231
Stop hitting me!
I have important work!

36:37.801 --> 36:39.267
He's heading for the exit!

36:42.739 --> 36:44.539
Booth, it's okay-- I've got him.

36:53.717 --> 36:54.783
Bones, where are you?

37:03.627 --> 37:05.026
(crowd whooping)

37:07.731 --> 37:08.741
Stick with him, Bones!
You got him!

37:08.765 --> 37:10.799
<i>I'm coming for you,</i>

37:10.834 --> 37:12.400
baby, I'm coming, Bones!

37:16.039 --> 37:17.305
(crowd cheering)

37:21.678 --> 37:22.811
(grunts)

37:24.448 --> 37:27.449
(Brennan gasping)
Bones, you okay?

37:27.484 --> 37:30.285
No. Whoo-hoo! I'm fantastic!

37:30.320 --> 37:32.754
(Booth groans)
(whoops) How's your back?

37:32.789 --> 37:34.055
Couldn't be better, Wanda.

37:34.091 --> 37:37.092
(Brennan laughs)
Hey there... Big Belly!

37:37.127 --> 37:39.995
My wife and I have
a few questions for you.

37:40.030 --> 37:41.496
FBI.

37:41.531 --> 37:42.964
(whooping)

37:43.000 --> 37:44.733
Really?
I'm done.

37:49.771 --> 37:51.671
Mr. Dixon, take a look
at the evidence.

37:51.706 --> 37:54.574
We found almost $40,000
in your trailer.

37:54.609 --> 37:56.175
(sighs)
I'm gonna tell you

37:56.211 --> 37:58.311
one more time--
I never killed him.

37:58.346 --> 37:59.946
How is the interrogation going?

37:59.981 --> 38:01.414
Well, he's denying it,

38:01.449 --> 38:02.749
but something's
not right.

38:02.784 --> 38:04.851
I mean, he's clearly guilty.
He had the money

38:04.886 --> 38:07.186
from the bank heist
in his possession.

38:07.222 --> 38:08.654
$20,000 is missing.

38:08.690 --> 38:10.523
Well, most likely,
Ned and Ray spent it.

38:10.558 --> 38:12.225
Well, Ned is saying that Dustin

38:12.260 --> 38:14.927
just only brought him $40,000.
And the bank manager

38:14.963 --> 38:17.063
said that $60,000 was taken.

38:17.098 --> 38:18.865
BOOTH: Which is why they
roughed up Dustin--

38:18.900 --> 38:20.126
'cause they thought
he was holding out.

38:20.150 --> 38:20.701
Then what?

38:20.702 --> 38:22.835
Just... let him go?

38:22.871 --> 38:25.338
(sighs)

38:25.373 --> 38:27.340
Dr. Fuentes.

38:27.375 --> 38:29.242
Dr. Brennan...

38:29.277 --> 38:31.778
that is an interesting
wardrobe you have on.

38:31.813 --> 38:34.747
Thank you. Your new lab coat
looks very nice as well.

38:34.783 --> 38:36.082
Oh, thank you.
You...

38:36.117 --> 38:38.918
Now show me you are worthy
of your new title.

38:38.953 --> 38:41.421
It is quite small, but...

38:41.456 --> 38:43.222
note the hexagonal
crushing fracture

38:43.258 --> 38:45.892
on the victim's
right intermediate cuneiform.

38:45.927 --> 38:47.696
It is an injury
I've seen before.

38:47.720 --> 38:48.762
As have I.

38:48.763 --> 38:52.365
Typically, when a female uses
the heel of her shoe

38:52.400 --> 38:54.400
to stab down on her

38:54.436 --> 38:56.302
assailant's foot.
What is strange is,

38:56.337 --> 38:59.205
both our suspects are men.

39:00.809 --> 39:03.109
Hey, I'm looking for Hodgins.

39:03.144 --> 39:05.011
Have you seen him?
Uh, no.

39:05.046 --> 39:06.512
Not for a couple
of hours.

39:06.548 --> 39:09.015
He went out looking
for potential burial sites

39:09.050 --> 39:10.883
for Gormogon's apprentice.

39:10.919 --> 39:12.718
So far he's zero for four.

39:12.754 --> 39:13.986
Ooh.

39:14.022 --> 39:15.354
SAROYAN:
What are we looking at?

39:15.390 --> 39:16.956
Is this more
bank robbery footage?

39:16.991 --> 39:18.257
MONTENEGRO:
No, not exactly.

39:18.293 --> 39:20.193
Uh, Booth said
something was weird

39:20.228 --> 39:22.728
and asked me to look at
the video surveillance footage

39:22.764 --> 39:24.664
from the day
after the robbery.

39:24.699 --> 39:26.132
Now I think I know why.

39:26.167 --> 39:28.734
Is that the, uh,
victim's car?

39:28.770 --> 39:29.902
Yeah.

39:29.938 --> 39:31.971
Looks like
he came back to the bank

39:32.006 --> 39:33.239
the following day.

39:33.274 --> 39:34.607
That's a hell of a risk.

39:34.642 --> 39:35.908
Yeah. And then, look--

39:35.944 --> 39:37.410
he follows that other car out.

39:37.445 --> 39:39.512
SAROYAN: Wait, can you
get the license plate

39:39.547 --> 39:40.646
on that other car?

39:40.682 --> 39:43.216
I've got the feeling
I know why he came back.

39:45.420 --> 39:47.620
BOOTH:
Ms. Fisher, we had a team

39:47.655 --> 39:50.123
go through your car,
and we found some blood

39:50.158 --> 39:53.359
caked in the trunk.
There, see?

39:53.394 --> 39:55.531
You don't understand,
this isn't my fault.

39:55.555 --> 39:56.697
You knew that Dustin

39:56.698 --> 39:58.965
was gonna rob your bank,
didn't you? You saw him

39:59.000 --> 40:00.519
on surveillance
casing the place.

40:00.619 --> 40:02.085
BOOTH: On the day
of the robbery,

40:02.120 --> 40:03.553
you handed over the $40,000,

40:03.589 --> 40:05.789
but you pocketed $20,000
for yourself.

40:06.174 --> 40:08.169
It was a victimless crime--
the bank is insured

40:08.170 --> 40:08.837
in case they're robbed.

40:08.861 --> 40:09.725
Yeah, but the
only problem is

40:09.726 --> 40:12.627
the bank manager went on TV
and said exactly

40:12.662 --> 40:14.049
how much was taken.

40:14.073 --> 40:16.083
Dustin must have
figured out what you did.

40:16.166 --> 40:18.466
So after he got beaten up
by his accomplices,

40:18.502 --> 40:20.402
he came back to
confront you-- that's when

40:20.437 --> 40:23.004
the two of you struggled
and you shot him.

40:23.039 --> 40:25.573
It was an accident. I...
None of this would have happened

40:25.609 --> 40:27.942
if my idiot boss had just
followed the manual.

40:27.978 --> 40:30.323
Everybody knows you're
not supposed to say how much was stolen.

40:30.347 --> 40:32.380
You're supposed to say
"an undisclosed amount."

40:32.416 --> 40:36.384
If he'd just done
his st-stupid job...

40:38.989 --> 40:41.956
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

40:47.164 --> 40:49.664
BOOTH: <i>I'm telling you,</i>
<i>you should've come with us.</i>

40:49.699 --> 40:50.965
<i>You should've seen Bones.</i>

40:51.001 --> 40:52.834
She was smashing things
left and right,

40:52.869 --> 40:55.837
bam, boom, and she was back!
BRENNAN: I was not back.

40:55.872 --> 40:57.205
Okay.

40:57.240 --> 40:59.207
Wanda, on the other hand,

40:59.242 --> 41:00.842
might have been back.

41:00.877 --> 41:02.477
Wanda?
Wanda's back.

41:02.512 --> 41:04.032
Oh, that's your-your
nom de guerre, is it?

41:04.056 --> 41:05.214
Yes.

41:05.215 --> 41:07.816
And I have to thank you.
You were correct--

41:07.851 --> 41:09.884
the derby was
just what I needed.

41:09.920 --> 41:12.064
WYATT: Well, I'm glad to hear it.
You see, I think it's

41:12.088 --> 41:14.088
very therapeutic
every now and then,

41:14.124 --> 41:16.157
to-to get out of your
proverbial skin, yeah?

41:16.193 --> 41:18.126
Right.
What about you, huh?

41:18.161 --> 41:20.395
Thinking about, I don't know,
hanging up the apron there

41:20.430 --> 41:23.431
and coming back to the bureau
and, uh, shrinking it up a bit?

41:23.467 --> 41:24.833
Agent Booth,
I must admit

41:24.868 --> 41:27.168
that, uh, over the
last few days, I...

41:27.204 --> 41:30.705
I have had a few moments where
I really, really enjoyed myself,

41:30.740 --> 41:34.609
but the fact is, I failed
in my assigned task.

41:34.644 --> 41:36.611
BOOTH:
No, no, you didn't fail.

41:36.646 --> 41:38.480
All right? It was a long shot.
Booth is right.

41:38.515 --> 41:41.894
You did everything you could.
Zack's situation is difficult.

41:41.895 --> 41:44.353
Well, it's very kind of you
to say that.

41:44.387 --> 41:45.920
So... Châteauneuf-Du-Pape

41:45.956 --> 41:47.455
for the next course?
Hey,

41:47.491 --> 41:49.001
if it's the pope's wine,
I'm drinking it.

41:49.025 --> 41:50.258
(phone rings)
BRENNAN: Hold on.

41:50.293 --> 41:51.392
It's Cam.

41:51.428 --> 41:52.927
Hello.

41:52.963 --> 41:54.863
Dr. Brennan, where are you?
We're gonna need you

41:54.898 --> 41:56.764
to come into the lab
as soon as possible.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.833
Um, of course.
Is everything all right?

41:58.869 --> 41:59.417
What's going on, Bones?

41:59.441 --> 42:00.903
Cam, I'm putting you
on speaker.

42:00.904 --> 42:02.237
HODGINS:
Is that her?

42:02.272 --> 42:04.072
Dr. Brennan,
you're on with Hodgins.

42:04.107 --> 42:06.074
Dr. Brennan, want
to make sure you know that Cam

42:06.109 --> 42:08.510
is right here next to me--
I don't want there to be

42:08.545 --> 42:10.778
any chance you think
I've falsified evidence.

42:10.814 --> 42:12.313
I don't understand.

42:12.349 --> 42:13.581
He found the apprentice.

42:13.617 --> 42:15.416
Uh, Dr. Hodgins,
it's Chef G...

42:15.452 --> 42:17.652
it's, uh, Dr. Gordon Wyatt here.

42:17.687 --> 42:19.888
A-Are you sure that it's him?

42:20.991 --> 42:22.724
Hell, yeah, partner.

42:22.759 --> 42:25.793
It's got to be-- the shape
of this thing is the inverse

42:25.829 --> 42:26.861
of a Masonic coffin.

42:26.897 --> 42:28.563
SAROYAN:
Okay, let's open her up.

42:29.466 --> 42:30.798
(grunts)

42:35.071 --> 42:36.804
Oh, wow.

42:36.840 --> 42:41.643
The clothes on this guy
are perfectly preserved.

42:42.612 --> 42:44.546
Dr. Hodgins, look at the cuff

42:44.581 --> 42:46.225
on his right arm.
BRENNAN (on phone): I need you

42:46.249 --> 42:48.049
to tell me
what you see.

42:48.084 --> 42:50.385
I am seeing what appears to be
dried blood.

42:50.420 --> 42:53.288
And if it's from the lobbyist...
Dr. Wyatt...

42:53.323 --> 42:55.290
thank you.

42:55.325 --> 42:57.125
Anything for an old friend.

42:57.160 --> 42:58.960
BRENNAN:
I can't believe it.

42:58.995 --> 43:01.162
Zack might actually
be coming home.

43:01.197 --> 43:04.399
Yeah, Zack could be back.
WYATT: I'll drink to that.
