WEBVTT

00:52.376 --> 00:55.376
Must you do this? We both work
for Jing Hing, man

00:55.501 --> 00:56.417
Do what?

00:56.876 --> 00:58.292
We're the "Water" gang, and you're "Metal",
we've nothing in common

00:58.292 --> 00:59.959
Are you losing your mind?

00:59.959 --> 01:01.584
The guy arguing with me, Coffee,

01:01.834 --> 01:05.167
happens to be the head of the "Water" gang

01:05.542 --> 01:07.376
Why are we arguing?

01:07.376 --> 01:10.292
It was all started by his boys and mine

01:10.959 --> 01:14.167
About what? How the hell would I know?

01:14.334 --> 01:16.251
Actually I didn't want to step in that night

01:16.251 --> 01:18.917
But I'm the boss,
must keep an eye on my gang...

01:18.917 --> 01:20.084
and my reputation

01:20.084 --> 01:21.876
- Watch what you're saying!
- OK!

01:33.542 --> 01:36.126
Every once in a while, some big shot says...

01:36.126 --> 01:38.292
like anybody, certain triads
love our country, too

01:38.292 --> 01:40.459
But what's more important is, I think...

01:40.709 --> 01:43.626
like anybody, certain triads love
their families, too

01:44.542 --> 01:48.542
Two red lines represent the coming of a baby

02:04.376 --> 02:05.334
Watch out!

02:13.834 --> 02:14.876
Fxxk!

02:14.876 --> 02:16.792
I'm OK, just a scratch!

02:16.792 --> 02:18.376
Many of our men are still out there!

02:19.751 --> 02:20.667
Luke!

02:20.667 --> 02:23.209
Come over here, come on!

02:24.251 --> 02:25.376
Watch him!

02:26.459 --> 02:28.167
I'll go finish them for you

02:29.084 --> 02:30.292
Be careful!

02:38.126 --> 02:39.042
Coffee!

02:39.042 --> 02:41.042
Only one of us can leave in one piece today!

02:43.042 --> 02:44.292
Freeze!

02:44.292 --> 02:45.209
Police!

02:46.126 --> 02:53.126
On your knees!

03:11.376 --> 03:13.417
Look, Chuck!

03:13.417 --> 03:15.334
I'm having a baby!

03:15.667 --> 03:17.417
You're gonna be a father!

03:22.417 --> 03:24.251
I love you!

03:27.251 --> 03:28.834
[Five years later]

03:28.876 --> 03:32.042
Had I been told earlier about that,

03:32.126 --> 03:34.251
I wouldn't have gone there

03:34.667 --> 03:38.126
I would run home to her with a take-out

03:38.542 --> 03:40.667
My wife loves sweet soup

03:40.876 --> 03:43.417
We first met at a sweet-soup place

03:43.959 --> 03:47.542
She used to be a popular young model

03:47.542 --> 03:50.584
Her portrait album sold out faster than
those fortune-telling books

03:50.751 --> 03:52.209
You could even buy a pillow
with her photo on it;

03:52.209 --> 03:53.959
her news was always
in the entertainment section

03:54.084 --> 03:57.167
Damn right! She didn't pick a rich kid

03:57.251 --> 04:00.042
She wanted to spend the rest of
her life with me! Too bad!

04:00.042 --> 04:03.126
If it wasn't true love, what was it?

04:19.416 --> 04:20.750
Hello?

04:22.917 --> 04:24.376
Another fight?

04:38.584 --> 04:39.751
Mme

04:40.042 --> 04:41.542
Your buttons

04:46.251 --> 04:48.959
It was a friend of mine's birthday last night,
there was too much to drink

04:52.709 --> 04:56.376
They had a fist-fight, so their teacher
brought them to me

04:56.376 --> 04:59.542
I asked them to shake hands
and be friends again

04:59.542 --> 05:02.376
But Chuck Junior pinched Fatty's hand instead

05:02.376 --> 05:04.751
Fatty gave him a big kick back

05:04.751 --> 05:07.501
So they fought again, nobody could stop them

05:07.501 --> 05:10.292
OK...understood!

05:10.417 --> 05:13.626
Like father like son, that was pretty normal

05:13.876 --> 05:15.542
What do you want me to do?

05:16.334 --> 05:17.792
Sorry, Ms. Principal

05:18.542 --> 05:22.042
I understand that mothers are
under a lot of pressure

05:22.042 --> 05:24.834
But you should model yourself as a father, too

05:24.834 --> 05:26.876
Set a good example for your son

05:28.792 --> 05:32.709
Actually I'm not Chuck Junior's dad,
Ms. Principal

05:32.709 --> 05:34.751
Then how are you related to him?

05:37.417 --> 05:39.042
I'm his dad's brother

05:39.042 --> 05:40.834
Baby brother or big brother?

05:42.084 --> 05:43.001
Uncle

05:44.126 --> 05:44.876
Are you OK, Mme?

05:44.876 --> 05:46.084
What's your position?

05:46.084 --> 05:47.209
Uncle!

05:50.334 --> 05:51.667
Position?

05:52.167 --> 05:53.167
We Jing Hing are subdivided into...

05:53.167 --> 05:55.917
"Metal", "Wood", "Water", "Fire",
and "Earth"; five gangs

05:55.917 --> 05:58.042
I'm in charge of "Metal"

05:58.584 --> 06:00.042
If it were a kindergarten,

06:00.042 --> 06:02.334
no doubt the principal has the highest position

06:02.334 --> 06:04.167
But as for the number of kids,

06:04.167 --> 06:06.417
Mine is beyond compare

06:18.084 --> 06:19.334
He's fxxking with you, boss

06:19.667 --> 06:20.876
I saw it

06:20.876 --> 06:22.501
- Let me punch him!
- No need!

06:24.084 --> 06:26.251
Haven't you heard of "P.R.No.No"?

06:26.251 --> 06:28.376
- It's in now!
- What's no no?

06:28.376 --> 06:31.542
Peaceful, rational, no violence,
no fxxking bad language

06:32.417 --> 06:34.417
No more fxxking foul mouth

06:35.042 --> 06:37.501
Boss, today's newspaper

06:38.626 --> 06:40.501
Remember!

06:40.501 --> 06:42.709
Triads or not, you must pay attention to
what's happening around you,

06:42.709 --> 06:45.001
to keep up with the times

06:45.001 --> 06:47.417
But I hate politics!

06:47.876 --> 06:48.917
You do?

06:48.917 --> 06:51.834
Nowadays, buying groceries in the wet market
involves politics, too

06:51.834 --> 06:53.209
Idiot!

06:54.292 --> 06:57.209
They say a JP (Justice of the Peace)
is coming today

06:57.209 --> 06:59.834
I'll help with you guys' requests

06:59.834 --> 07:01.917
I've been bullied and beaten less and less...

07:01.917 --> 07:04.834
since you let me join you, boss

07:04.834 --> 07:05.917
I won't forget this

07:05.917 --> 07:08.084
Once my boss, always my boss

07:08.792 --> 07:10.334
Write down the requests!

07:10.334 --> 07:11.251
OK!

07:11.334 --> 07:15.084
Any requests or complaints? Tell me

07:15.084 --> 07:15.959
I have

07:15.959 --> 07:17.876
Yes?

07:19.001 --> 07:20.709
Noble JP, how are you?

07:20.709 --> 07:21.834
Lam is my family name

07:21.834 --> 07:25.209
I request more books in the reading room

07:25.334 --> 07:28.292
- Such as comic books
- Comic books?

07:28.292 --> 07:31.542
We're all dying to read the "Teddy-boy" series,

07:31.542 --> 07:34.542
or maybe more fortune-telling books?

07:34.542 --> 07:36.084
One per year is enough

07:36.084 --> 07:38.667
People say "Knowledge changes one's fortune,

07:38.667 --> 07:40.501
and fortune determines one's character"

07:40.501 --> 07:43.209
Also, I request more porno magazines

07:43.209 --> 07:45.042
Such as "Playboy"

07:45.042 --> 07:47.292
On one hand, it would quench our thirst,

07:47.292 --> 07:49.417
on the other hand, we could improve
our foreign language skills

07:49.417 --> 07:52.959
I guess you'll have to be
more persuasive than that

07:53.876 --> 07:57.334
Well, a person without a sex life...

07:57.334 --> 07:59.542
won't able to learn to respect himself,

07:59.709 --> 08:02.084
not to mention learning to respect others

08:02.084 --> 08:05.542
So we prisoners beat the shit out
of each other every day

08:05.542 --> 08:08.417
However, if we were all able to jerk off,

08:08.417 --> 08:11.042
this would be a community
of harmony and tolerance

08:11.084 --> 08:12.584
Is that so?

08:12.584 --> 08:14.542
I've done research on that

08:14.542 --> 08:17.751
This newspaper clip is about prisons in Greece

08:18.042 --> 08:22.209
It says, "Prisoners make love in
a room set up in prison"

08:22.209 --> 08:23.251
Take a look!

08:24.042 --> 08:26.084
A separate room in prison...

08:26.084 --> 08:28.042
for prisoners to make love with their wives...

08:28.042 --> 08:29.709
is a human right

08:29.709 --> 08:31.751
They've had it since 2005

08:31.751 --> 08:35.083
And us? 2017 will be here soon!

08:36.583 --> 08:39.333
I will seriously consider your request

08:39.333 --> 08:40.708
Many thanks!

08:41.208 --> 08:45.167
Good!

08:48.376 --> 08:50.042
OK!

08:50.959 --> 08:52.292
OK!

08:52.417 --> 08:54.459
A boss should take good care of his boys

08:54.459 --> 08:57.001
The thing is, I've never seen my son...

08:57.001 --> 08:58.792
since his birth

08:58.917 --> 09:02.042
I should take good care of this boy first

09:02.167 --> 09:05.292
I'm thinking of retiring when I'm out of here

09:05.834 --> 09:08.042
Then why do I still keep my gang?

09:28.834 --> 09:30.626
Because if I were all by myself here,

09:30.626 --> 09:32.876
Coffee could get me killed any time

09:33.792 --> 09:35.751
In fact, I've been trying my best
to keep a low profile,

09:36.126 --> 09:38.584
as well as staying alert, but at the same time

09:38.584 --> 09:41.792
maintaining "P.R.No.No"

09:45.626 --> 09:46.834
What do you want?

09:46.834 --> 09:48.417
- To take a pee!
- Wait a second!

10:10.376 --> 10:11.542
Don't come near...

10:11.542 --> 10:13.126
I'll stab him!

10:14.667 --> 10:17.584
Sharpened your toothbrush, so cool, eh?

10:17.584 --> 10:18.542
No more shit!

10:18.542 --> 10:20.584
Only one of us can walk out
of here alive today!

10:20.584 --> 10:22.292
Don't you have anything new to say, man?

10:23.917 --> 10:25.042
Just kill me, if you wish!

10:27.751 --> 10:29.626
You really hate my guts, don't you?

10:29.626 --> 10:31.959
Only one of us can live
to become the Dragon Head...

10:31.959 --> 10:33.417
when we get out anyway

10:36.876 --> 10:38.709
Why would I want to be the Dragon Head?

10:42.376 --> 10:43.751
Hey!

10:45.334 --> 10:47.209
We are even now

10:50.792 --> 10:52.376
The lab report is here

10:52.376 --> 10:54.042
Look at your prostate

10:54.042 --> 10:57.917
This...this...is all cancer cells

11:14.292 --> 11:17.709
Are you fxxking sure about that?

11:17.709 --> 11:19.417
Do you need to double-check your glasses, man?

11:19.417 --> 11:21.126
I have cancer?

11:21.126 --> 11:24.876
No, no! Calm down, please!
I know it's hard to accept

11:34.834 --> 11:36.959
I started killing at 14,

11:36.959 --> 11:39.167
became a gang leader at 20

11:39.167 --> 11:41.667
A fortune teller said I would live to 80

11:41.667 --> 11:43.751
How can I have cancer now?

11:54.001 --> 11:57.292
You have one last chance to tell me again.
Do I have cancer?

12:19.209 --> 12:21.501
Our son is growing fast

12:21.834 --> 12:23.459
Grade 1 next year

12:23.459 --> 12:25.376
Do you know any big shots...

12:25.376 --> 12:27.126
who can write him a letter of recommendation?

12:27.292 --> 12:28.834
Would a shady businessman do?

12:28.834 --> 12:30.709
I mean Cai, the one I used
to help smuggle tobacco

12:30.709 --> 12:31.876
He lives in Repulse Bay!

12:31.959 --> 12:34.126
I mean for a prestigious school!

12:34.626 --> 12:35.834
A JP

12:35.834 --> 12:38.667
A JP who visits here is
quite willing to listen to me

12:39.167 --> 12:40.917
Wonder when I'll see her next?

12:44.042 --> 12:45.834
He has learned to walk, to run,
and to swear, right?

12:46.209 --> 12:49.084
All his bad habits came from you.
He fights all the time!

12:49.542 --> 12:50.667
Does he win, or lose?

12:50.667 --> 12:52.584
Winning fights is no big deal

12:52.584 --> 12:54.209
His father is never with him

12:54.209 --> 12:56.459
His school principal often asks to talk with me

12:58.001 --> 12:59.917
Let's not talk about our son anymore

13:00.334 --> 13:02.084
Let me take a good look at you

13:03.751 --> 13:04.917
OK!

13:05.709 --> 13:07.667
You're very pretty today!

13:11.501 --> 13:12.917
I want to see your "balls" (meaning tits)

13:12.917 --> 13:13.709
What?

13:14.751 --> 13:15.917
Your "balls"!

13:15.917 --> 13:17.334
You're nuts!

13:21.751 --> 13:23.292
I've been in here for 5 years

13:23.292 --> 13:25.209
I haven't even got to watch a football,

13:25.209 --> 13:27.251
not to mention yours

13:31.501 --> 13:32.834
I love you!

13:41.792 --> 13:44.042
Never mind about him! Lucky him. Fxxk!

14:12.959 --> 14:14.001
OK or not?

14:14.417 --> 14:16.626
Doing magic or what? Like a flasher!

14:32.251 --> 14:35.084
Godfather is waiting in there, uncles

14:38.626 --> 14:39.751
Godfather!

14:41.709 --> 14:43.334
Hello!

14:44.584 --> 14:45.792
How have you been?

14:50.667 --> 14:52.792
Uncle Sky's brandy

14:57.584 --> 14:59.459
Uncle Earth's Maotai white wine

15:01.667 --> 15:04.376
Also Uncle Man's high quality Puer tea

15:04.584 --> 15:07.126
Gentlemen, I'll be out there,
let me know if you need me

15:10.126 --> 15:13.626
Coke is quite smart, he knows what we all like

15:13.709 --> 15:16.126
- Fxxk, it was all my idea
- Pardon?

15:16.126 --> 15:18.959
Fxxk if we had to depend on him

15:18.959 --> 15:20.042
Have a sip

15:21.626 --> 15:22.876
Cheers...

15:27.251 --> 15:31.209
The reason I got you all here today is...

15:31.376 --> 15:35.209
it's been 3 years, time for Jing Hing
to have a new Dragon Head

15:35.209 --> 15:38.292
To save us the trouble,

15:38.292 --> 15:40.084
why don't we let Coke serve another term?

15:40.084 --> 15:41.209
Whatever you say

15:41.209 --> 15:43.876
All we need is an executive Dragon Head,

15:43.876 --> 15:46.542
simply carrying out orders
and playing no tricks behind our back

15:46.959 --> 15:49.417
That's exactly what Coke is doing now

15:49.417 --> 15:52.501
I have nothing against him

15:52.501 --> 15:55.584
Everybody knows Coke is your man

15:55.792 --> 15:58.876
His experience, his seniority,
are all perfect for his role

15:58.876 --> 16:00.251
But let me remind you...

16:00.292 --> 16:02.834
that we ran the whole show 3 years ago

16:02.834 --> 16:04.876
We four nominated him,

16:04.876 --> 16:07.334
plus the unanimous vote of all 5 gang leaders,

16:07.334 --> 16:08.667
playing a little skin-deep democracy

16:08.667 --> 16:12.001
Fxxk! That's why I'm setting up
a Nominations Committee here today

16:12.292 --> 16:13.709
Speaking of that,

16:13.709 --> 16:16.292
make sure the supporting cast
don't steal the show

16:16.292 --> 16:19.042
By the way, someone named Wulf from "Fire"...

16:19.042 --> 16:22.542
has been attracting a lot of attention lately,

16:22.542 --> 16:23.417
and receiving a lot of support

16:23.417 --> 16:25.792
Fxxk, he's an inside man

16:25.792 --> 16:29.001
He used to be a cop! An undercover cop!

16:29.001 --> 16:32.001
For the Commercial Crime Bureau!

16:32.001 --> 16:34.834
That asshole talks like an opera singer!

16:34.834 --> 16:36.251
I just don't fxxking understand

16:36.626 --> 16:39.501
Why did Tiger Tooth take him in before?

16:39.542 --> 16:41.417
Fxxk, forget about that inside man

16:41.417 --> 16:43.709
- Take him off the list!
- Not him!

16:44.167 --> 16:47.876
Also Chuck of "Metal", and Coffee of "Water",

16:47.876 --> 16:49.459
are both getting out soon

16:49.459 --> 16:51.584
Whoever's gonna take over,

16:51.584 --> 16:54.376
must stay loyal to our Club,

16:54.376 --> 16:55.792
and to us!

16:55.792 --> 16:56.917
Being a little stupid is OK!

16:56.917 --> 16:59.292
Fxxk! Having said that,

16:59.292 --> 17:00.876
the supporting cast has
to play its role seriously, too

17:00.917 --> 17:02.917
No small potato

17:04.001 --> 17:06.751
One of Chuck's men, called Luke something,

17:06.834 --> 17:08.876
saved Chuck's life in a fight

17:09.709 --> 17:12.376
It's pure luck to have
someone like him these days

17:12.666 --> 17:15.709
But Luke can't be compared to Coke

17:15.959 --> 17:17.334
It doesn't matter

17:17.459 --> 17:19.209
He's perfect for our supporting cast

17:19.209 --> 17:21.291
All right, put him in then

17:21.334 --> 17:22.709
OK

17:26.084 --> 17:27.001
Cheers!

17:30.126 --> 17:31.542
Hey, Wulf!

17:31.876 --> 17:33.001
What brings you here?

17:33.251 --> 17:34.376
Nothing big!

17:35.501 --> 17:37.626
Just got some real good wine for the uncles

17:37.626 --> 17:39.126
We're not celebrating anything today

17:39.126 --> 17:40.417
Come back next year!

17:40.417 --> 17:42.001
You don't know what you're saying

17:42.001 --> 17:43.959
I didn't bring the wine for any occasion

17:43.959 --> 17:46.876
Do you think I can't afford it?

17:46.917 --> 17:48.792
OK! Let me help you with that

17:48.959 --> 17:51.126
- To storage!
- Hold it!

17:51.417 --> 17:53.459
No need to trouble you, Coke

17:53.459 --> 17:55.042
I want to deliver them myself

17:55.042 --> 17:56.876
This is my place!

17:56.876 --> 17:58.376
It's not up to you

17:58.376 --> 18:00.376
I'm here just for a delivery,
what trouble do you think I'd make?

18:00.376 --> 18:01.751
I said I would help you with that!

18:01.751 --> 18:04.251
- Don't move!
- What?

18:07.292 --> 18:10.001
What, man?

18:10.001 --> 18:11.626
Sorry, sorry!

18:11.626 --> 18:14.709
I made my way here to deliver
some goodies to the uncles

18:16.001 --> 18:18.542
The 30-year Yamazaki, for Godfather

18:18.667 --> 18:20.834
Louis XIII, for you, Uncle Sky

18:21.417 --> 18:24.084
The 50-year Maotai, for you, Uncle Earth

18:24.084 --> 18:25.542
And...

18:26.251 --> 18:29.542
this good old Puer is for you, Uncle Man

18:30.459 --> 18:33.709
You surely know what please us, eh, kiddo!

18:34.251 --> 18:35.792
What's all this about?

18:35.834 --> 18:36.792
Birthday presents?

18:36.834 --> 18:38.459
Just a token of appreciation

18:38.626 --> 18:39.626
Yeah, right!

18:39.834 --> 18:43.167
It will be time to pick
our new Dragon Head very soon

18:43.167 --> 18:45.709
That's why I came

18:45.709 --> 18:48.167
Serving Jing Hing is my greatest pleasure

18:48.334 --> 18:52.459
The rule is that only 2 candidates are admitted

18:52.459 --> 18:55.001
And we have just made our choices

18:55.001 --> 18:56.876
Oh, am I too late?

18:56.876 --> 18:59.376
Let me suggest taking one out

18:59.542 --> 19:00.751
And putting me in

19:00.751 --> 19:01.876
What the hell are you talking about?

19:01.876 --> 19:04.042
Bugger off!

19:04.042 --> 19:05.709
- What did you say?
- Who do you think you are?

19:08.751 --> 19:11.251
Stop making noise!

19:16.584 --> 19:18.542
Whoever is our Dragon Head...

19:19.584 --> 19:21.584
must be well-accepted
and closely-connected with us all

19:22.459 --> 19:25.209
So that everyone can continue with
his money-making in peace

19:25.209 --> 19:27.167
He must stay the fxxk out of our way,

19:28.292 --> 19:34.126
and not talk like...what's the word?

19:34.126 --> 19:36.084
- He's reciting
- Like he's reciting something!

19:37.084 --> 19:39.292
Now as for who the finalists are,

19:39.792 --> 19:41.584
we've come to some kind of consensus,

19:41.626 --> 19:43.376
and will let you know at the right time

19:43.417 --> 19:46.376
Oh! So no deadline has been set yet!
I almost had a heart attack, man!

19:46.417 --> 19:48.709
Well, I've opened a new place lately,

19:48.751 --> 19:50.542
and got some new wine and chicks in

19:50.584 --> 19:52.251
C'mon over and take a look when you're free...

19:52.292 --> 19:54.709
and tell me what you think of how I run it

19:54.834 --> 19:56.126
The young are always smarter than us oldies

19:56.376 --> 19:58.001
- I'll pay you a visit sometime
- OK!

19:58.042 --> 19:59.042
Anytime

19:59.084 --> 20:00.084
See you

20:00.709 --> 20:02.042
Put it down

20:07.042 --> 20:08.542
Fxxk! Making such a big fuss...

20:08.542 --> 20:09.917
out of such a trivial thing

20:09.959 --> 20:10.834
Keep on dancing!

20:12.376 --> 20:13.626
Hey! Music!

20:13.917 --> 20:14.584
Dance!

20:23.667 --> 20:27.084
Go get some high-fiber food for the dog

20:27.126 --> 20:28.209
Yes!

20:29.876 --> 20:30.667
Coke!

20:32.626 --> 20:34.667
Get me 2 fresh killers

20:36.417 --> 20:37.792
Also check out...

20:38.126 --> 20:40.417
when Chuck and Coffee will be out

20:41.792 --> 20:42.709
Yes!

20:55.709 --> 20:57.501
The form is done, Mme

20:57.542 --> 20:59.959
Sign here, I'll take it back
to the school for you

21:06.001 --> 21:07.167
OK

21:08.376 --> 21:11.334
Is Chuck really getting out tomorrow?

21:11.376 --> 21:13.959
Yes! We'll go pick him up tomorrow

21:15.876 --> 21:17.959
Actually I don't want him out!

21:18.417 --> 21:19.542
Why not, Mme?

21:20.042 --> 21:21.501
- Luke!
- Yes, Mme?

21:22.792 --> 21:24.584
I know you like me!

21:24.626 --> 21:25.542
What are you doing, Mme?

21:25.584 --> 21:27.167
If not, why are you so nice to me?

21:27.209 --> 21:29.626
No, Mme! I mean it!

21:31.834 --> 21:33.667
Stay calm, Mme

21:35.334 --> 21:38.334
I owe Chuck my life

21:38.709 --> 21:40.417
I mustn't do this!

21:40.834 --> 21:43.209
I don't believe you! I don't believe you!

21:43.209 --> 21:44.209
No!

21:44.251 --> 21:46.084
- I don't...
- Don't do that!

21:46.126 --> 21:48.126
- I don't believe you!
- Stop!

21:48.751 --> 21:50.376
I don't want to hurt you!

21:52.334 --> 21:54.042
I have to look after you and the kid...

21:54.292 --> 21:56.084
until Chuck is out of jail

21:56.084 --> 21:58.042
Don't mention him anymore!

21:58.292 --> 22:01.292
I've done more than he deserves all these years

22:01.834 --> 22:03.751
When has he ever...

22:03.751 --> 22:05.542
played his part as a father, as a husband?

22:06.126 --> 22:07.751
You should know better than me

22:11.167 --> 22:12.459
I'd better get going

22:13.084 --> 22:14.417
Luke!

22:18.709 --> 22:20.376
Asshole!

22:25.459 --> 22:28.126
[Stanley Prison]

22:33.084 --> 22:35.751
My big day today, feeling so high!

22:35.751 --> 22:37.667
I get to touch my wife and kid very soon

22:37.792 --> 22:40.376
I'll hug them, kiss them, this and that

22:40.501 --> 22:42.126
It's gonna be very touching

22:42.126 --> 22:43.876
Chuck Lam, time to leave!

22:43.876 --> 22:46.709
It's gonna be the first time
someone calls me dad

22:46.876 --> 22:49.584
To get promoted from a boss to a father

22:49.584 --> 22:51.667
It's got to feel so warm that
I won't know how to react

22:51.667 --> 22:53.292
But I will hold back my tears

22:53.417 --> 22:55.542
I can't let my son see my soft side

22:55.542 --> 22:57.709
Boss!

22:57.709 --> 22:59.792
No need to come back to visit us!

23:01.542 --> 23:02.709
Come find me when you're out!

23:02.709 --> 23:04.084
I will!

23:04.084 --> 23:04.917
Boss!

23:04.917 --> 23:09.376
I hate to say good-bye!

23:12.209 --> 23:13.667
What time is it, Sir?

23:13.667 --> 23:15.667
- 9:30
- Thanks!

23:29.417 --> 23:31.834
Boss!

23:31.834 --> 23:32.959
Did you hear that?

23:32.959 --> 23:36.292
I really thought I was conducting a concert
in the Hung Hum Coliseum

23:36.501 --> 23:37.417
Boss!

23:37.417 --> 23:39.167
Oh, no!

23:39.167 --> 23:42.501
Coffee and I were jailed at the same time

23:42.501 --> 23:44.834
Now we're getting out
at the same time, too, man?

23:44.834 --> 23:46.167
What the heck!

23:46.167 --> 23:49.126
Don't make us die
at the same time, too, please!

23:49.126 --> 23:50.167
If that's so,

23:50.167 --> 23:52.584
I would really think we were
a gay couple in our previous lives

23:52.584 --> 23:54.292
That's why we got tangled up
with each other in this life

23:54.292 --> 23:57.667
Chuck!

23:57.667 --> 23:59.542
Where's my wife and kid?

23:59.584 --> 24:03.334
Chuck!

24:04.376 --> 24:09.876
Chuck!

24:09.876 --> 24:12.959
- Boss!
- Chuck!

24:13.667 --> 24:15.626
Run, Chuck! Run!

24:20.084 --> 24:21.417
Run! Boss!

24:21.542 --> 24:23.042
Run!

24:29.584 --> 24:30.584
Hey! What's happening?

24:30.584 --> 24:32.126
Stop that!

24:32.667 --> 24:35.209
Don't!

24:35.209 --> 24:37.501
Boss, run! Boss!

24:39.917 --> 24:41.542
Get in the car!

24:48.417 --> 24:50.251
A triad boss is being murdered,

24:50.251 --> 24:52.584
and he's hiding by a prison wall

24:52.876 --> 24:55.084
It would be highly embarrassing
if anyone found out about it

24:55.084 --> 24:56.792
This is the worst thing that can happen to me

24:58.209 --> 25:00.584
I've told you many times, Sir

25:00.584 --> 25:03.501
We were all very happy waiting
outside the jail for Chuck

25:03.501 --> 25:06.126
All of a sudden, some men jumped out
from nowhere to kill us

25:06.126 --> 25:08.126
We ran like hell, of course!

25:08.126 --> 25:11.417
Then you people came out to grab us

25:11.417 --> 25:12.792
Where are you going?

25:13.792 --> 25:15.834
I'm the victim, none of your business

25:16.167 --> 25:17.959
I survived the killing, can't I thank
General Kwan for that?

25:17.959 --> 25:20.751
This is a police station, not your territory

25:20.751 --> 25:21.792
Sit down!

25:21.792 --> 25:23.667
Why must you raise your voice?

25:24.084 --> 25:25.209
Don't I have freedom of religion?

25:25.209 --> 25:27.126
Go home and thank your own God!

25:30.251 --> 25:32.376
Charge him or send him home. Be quick!

25:32.376 --> 25:33.084
Yes, Sir!

25:33.709 --> 25:35.334
- Sit down!
- Don't touch me!

25:35.334 --> 25:36.667
We'll sit down ourselves

25:39.459 --> 25:40.709
Hurry, Sir!

25:41.792 --> 25:43.376
Do we need to keep an eye on them?

25:43.376 --> 25:45.251
The same thing happens every time
before they get a new Dragon Head

25:45.251 --> 25:47.334
Just do the right thing at the right time

25:47.334 --> 25:48.667
Be decisive in enforcing our rules

25:48.667 --> 25:49.584
Yes, Sir!

25:49.584 --> 25:50.792
Go to Shanghai Street,

25:51.001 --> 25:52.917
get a statue fxxking taller than
theirs to take home!

25:56.917 --> 25:57.959
You...

25:58.167 --> 26:00.417
You were supposed to pick me up
outside prison today

26:00.626 --> 26:02.792
Why did you drag me back in there?

26:03.126 --> 26:05.251
That's bad luck!

26:06.542 --> 26:07.376
Sorry!

26:11.251 --> 26:14.292
Never mind. It was a mess anyway

26:15.626 --> 26:18.042
Who wanted to kill Coffee and me?

26:19.751 --> 26:22.167
Who's most powerful among us lately?

26:22.417 --> 26:25.084
A new head of "Fire"...

26:25.292 --> 26:26.709
called Wulf,

26:27.709 --> 26:29.126
is getting lots of support

26:29.126 --> 26:30.917
Fxxk! Those newcomers never know what's right

26:31.667 --> 26:33.292
Just popping up from nowhere

26:34.667 --> 26:36.792
Godfather doesn't like him much

26:37.209 --> 26:38.709
He clashed with Coke not too long ago

26:39.292 --> 26:41.126
Good for him

26:41.292 --> 26:43.251
Coke is very treacherous

26:43.501 --> 26:46.209
Some years ago, I had some interest in
running for Dragon Head

26:46.667 --> 26:49.959
He wouldn't even be close,

26:49.959 --> 26:51.959
if it hadn't been for Godfather
and the other uncles pulling strings

26:52.584 --> 26:54.292
It's got to be Coke! He wants another term,

26:54.292 --> 26:57.084
Coffee and I could be in his way

26:57.084 --> 26:58.667
So he put a price on our heads

26:58.834 --> 26:59.792
Don't you agree?

27:00.667 --> 27:05.084
In fact, those uncles nominated Coke...

27:05.376 --> 27:06.376
and me already

27:15.959 --> 27:17.542
You are the right choice

27:19.084 --> 27:20.709
But why did you give the order to kill me?

27:22.876 --> 27:24.251
I didn't, Chuck!

27:24.334 --> 27:25.959
No joke, man!

27:26.459 --> 27:29.126
I have never had such thought! Not me!

27:30.084 --> 27:32.251
I'm running simply on "Metal's" behalf

27:32.459 --> 27:33.834
Now that you're out

27:33.917 --> 27:35.959
You should take charge again

27:36.876 --> 27:39.001
I didn't do it! It wasn't me!

27:44.667 --> 27:46.501
Luke!

27:46.709 --> 27:48.251
Although you're under me,

27:48.251 --> 27:50.584
we've known each other since primary school

27:50.584 --> 27:52.251
And you got injured while saving my life

27:52.251 --> 27:53.917
Even if I order you to take my life now,

27:53.917 --> 27:55.376
you would kill yourself first!

27:55.376 --> 27:56.959
How could you want my life? Are you nuts?

27:56.959 --> 27:58.917
I was just kidding you, man!

28:01.209 --> 28:02.667
You never laugh at my jokes!

28:02.792 --> 28:05.417
It's no fun to crack jokes
for people like you, really no fun!

28:10.334 --> 28:12.292
Have you a charger?

28:12.584 --> 28:15.251
Yes! I have one

28:19.084 --> 28:19.751
Here!

28:20.292 --> 28:22.251
- Hey!
- It can't go in

28:23.084 --> 28:25.001
Those cunning businessmen are like that

28:25.292 --> 28:26.876
A new phone always comes with a new plug

28:27.042 --> 28:28.667
They make more money this way

28:28.876 --> 28:30.501
I'll get you an old cable later

28:32.001 --> 28:34.209
A new version comes in from time to time

28:34.334 --> 28:36.792
If I'd spent longer in jail, everybody
would be driving a space shuttle

28:37.751 --> 28:40.292
Touch wood! Let's go to the sauna first

28:43.792 --> 28:46.417
Hold it! Let me give her a surprise

28:51.751 --> 28:52.917
Let me help you, Chuck!

28:58.751 --> 29:00.042
Chuck

29:02.417 --> 29:03.667
Sweetie!

29:06.251 --> 29:07.501
Sweetie!

29:11.417 --> 29:12.126
Chuck

29:12.834 --> 29:14.251
I'm leaving

29:21.084 --> 29:23.042
Oh yeah, go see my son first

29:23.834 --> 29:24.584
My son!

29:38.167 --> 29:39.959
Your dad is back, sonny

29:40.709 --> 29:41.959
Hello?

29:42.417 --> 29:44.667
Look who's back? Your Dad!

29:47.334 --> 29:49.001
I recognize you

29:49.584 --> 29:50.709
Call me "Dad"

29:51.501 --> 29:53.251
What about Uncle Luke?

29:54.209 --> 29:56.167
You came home so late

29:56.667 --> 29:58.542
He had to sleep

30:02.751 --> 30:04.167
Don't you want to call me dad?

30:05.417 --> 30:07.042
Call me father then

30:07.376 --> 30:08.417
Old pop is OK, too

30:12.626 --> 30:13.251
Say it!

30:14.584 --> 30:16.584
Why raise your voice? Go away!

30:16.584 --> 30:18.417
- Mom!
- That's the first thing you do to your son!

30:20.417 --> 30:22.084
It's all right!

30:29.542 --> 30:30.459
Get up

30:39.876 --> 30:42.209
It's OK! Good boy!

30:42.876 --> 30:44.542
Go back to sleep, lie down

30:44.667 --> 30:45.959
It's OK

30:51.667 --> 30:53.751
Don't touch me!

31:08.084 --> 31:10.376
What kind of mother are you? Look at you!

31:10.584 --> 31:12.334
Your son can't tell who his father is!

31:12.334 --> 31:14.459
What kind of father are you then?

31:14.584 --> 31:16.209
What have you done for your family?

31:16.209 --> 31:17.959
All you know is fighting!

31:17.959 --> 31:21.292
You even fought on your big day today

31:34.834 --> 31:36.501
Don't touch me!

31:36.709 --> 31:39.292
You didn't want him to know
his father was in jail

31:40.542 --> 31:42.251
His schoolmates always ask...

31:42.376 --> 31:44.626
"Why does your dad never show up?"

31:44.959 --> 31:46.459
What do you want him to say?

31:47.501 --> 31:48.751
His answer would be easier if you were dead

31:49.876 --> 31:52.459
Or do you want me to tell the whole
world you just got out of jail today

31:52.459 --> 31:55.251
Please come to our party and celebrate?

31:55.542 --> 31:57.709
The head of Jing Hing's "Metal" gang!

31:59.126 --> 32:00.542
That's who you were

32:00.917 --> 32:02.542
But not any more!

32:13.417 --> 32:17.584
Didn't she expect that when she married me?

32:18.626 --> 32:21.876
My men are ready to defend my life

32:22.126 --> 32:23.959
Why is my wife like that?

32:24.334 --> 32:26.376
I really don't understand women

32:26.959 --> 32:29.167
But it doesn't matter, I have my men!

32:39.667 --> 32:42.126
10, none, 10, none

32:42.126 --> 32:43.834
You're cheating!

32:43.834 --> 32:44.709
OK, cheers!

32:44.709 --> 32:46.084
You just want free drinks!

32:46.876 --> 32:48.501
You're the boss here

32:48.501 --> 32:50.876
Of course my drinks are free

32:50.876 --> 32:52.209
I want to play, boss!

32:52.209 --> 32:54.042
No need, I'll just pinch them

32:55.751 --> 32:56.626
Come on, let me pinch them

32:56.626 --> 32:57.917
- Chuck!
- Your chick?

32:58.417 --> 32:59.792
Never mind her

32:59.834 --> 33:02.876
Since you're out, all the boys
will go back to you

33:02.959 --> 33:05.001
Oh, whoever, it makes no difference

33:05.001 --> 33:06.667
Let's deal with it later!

33:09.792 --> 33:12.084
- It finished charging already
- Yeah, it's very fast

33:12.584 --> 33:15.084
Look at these plugs you bought, amazing!

33:15.084 --> 33:16.042
So many!

33:16.042 --> 33:18.334
One has got to fit, fxxk it if not!

33:20.542 --> 33:22.751
I'm looking at the incriminating evidence,
want to join me?

33:22.751 --> 33:23.626
No, boss

33:23.626 --> 33:24.584
It's just the killing, have a look

33:24.584 --> 33:26.251
No, thank you!

33:26.792 --> 33:28.501
I'll have a drink

33:33.709 --> 33:35.459
Look, Chuck!

33:35.459 --> 33:37.126
I'm pregnant!

33:37.542 --> 33:39.292
You're gonna be a father!

33:42.667 --> 33:44.292
I love you!

33:46.542 --> 33:48.626
We'll be very happy

33:55.876 --> 33:56.626
Let's go

33:56.876 --> 33:57.709
So early?

33:57.709 --> 33:59.501
- Let's watch the show first
- No!

33:59.501 --> 34:01.542
Congratulations, Chuck!

34:01.542 --> 34:02.876
Have a drink first

34:02.876 --> 34:04.126
I'm sleepy

34:04.126 --> 34:06.667
I changed from an night owl
to an early bird in jail

34:06.667 --> 34:08.417
I hit the sack at 9 something

34:08.417 --> 34:09.876
It's so late, I'm leaving!

34:09.876 --> 34:11.042
- Chuck!
- Cheers

34:11.917 --> 34:13.333
Go home to your wife

34:14.458 --> 34:15.626
You're doing the right thing

34:15.626 --> 34:17.001
I have a lot to learn from you

34:17.001 --> 34:18.626
You took good care of them

34:21.208 --> 34:23.126
- Someone will give you a ride
- OK!

36:45.417 --> 36:47.792
"Sour grapes" (meaning unattainable women)

36:47.917 --> 36:49.667
But when you can eat them,
they excite you instead

36:50.251 --> 36:51.501
Her name is Coco

36:51.542 --> 36:53.251
She has made it clear to me that...

36:53.251 --> 36:55.126
understanding women isn't important

36:55.209 --> 36:57.417
Because women aren't for men to understand,

36:57.501 --> 36:58.959
But for men to...

36:59.834 --> 37:02.792
A grown man having no sex for 5 years,

37:03.126 --> 37:04.834
the strength he accumulates...

37:04.834 --> 37:07.251
is like a nuclear bomb exploding

37:07.251 --> 37:10.417
- Here I come! I'm coming
- No! Hold it!

37:10.417 --> 37:12.042
- How?
- Hold it!

37:12.042 --> 37:14.459
Now is best time to tell your fortune

37:15.376 --> 37:16.626
You can't be serious

37:16.626 --> 37:18.959
I'm here to fxxk, and you want
to tell my fortune?

37:18.959 --> 37:20.876
Shuffle the cards!

37:29.917 --> 37:32.251
You and your wife quarreled

37:32.251 --> 37:33.709
That's nothing unusual

37:34.667 --> 37:35.917
No, not yet!

37:35.917 --> 37:37.792
Hold it!

37:39.542 --> 37:40.709
Unbelievable, Chuck!

37:40.709 --> 37:43.584
It's the Emperor! You'll be appointed
Dragon Head of Jing Hing

37:44.751 --> 37:46.459
You'll be the Dragon Head of Jing Hing!

37:50.792 --> 37:52.417
You'll be in charge of Jing Hing...

37:52.626 --> 37:53.542
OK!

37:53.542 --> 37:55.792
I want to be the Dragon Head of Jing Hing!

37:56.459 --> 37:57.959
I want to be the Dragon Head of Jing Hing!

37:58.876 --> 38:01.167
I want to be the Dragon Head of Jing Hing!

38:22.251 --> 38:23.626
Chuck!

38:37.209 --> 38:38.376
Chuck!

38:38.792 --> 38:39.959
Chuck!

38:41.042 --> 38:44.126
Was she OK, Chuck?

38:52.126 --> 38:53.626
I want to be the Dragon Head of Jing Hing!

38:53.626 --> 38:55.042
What do you think?

38:55.584 --> 38:56.417
Good idea!

39:03.959 --> 39:06.376
Well, have you asked what we think, too?

39:10.292 --> 39:13.251
Only us four can decide on the candidates

39:14.417 --> 39:16.751
It's not up to you to say...

39:16.751 --> 39:18.917
who's in or out

39:19.292 --> 39:22.209
We aren't dealing with a club membership

39:23.417 --> 39:25.376
What's the point of keeping things
that are no use to us?

39:25.959 --> 39:26.834
7 of sticks

39:26.834 --> 39:29.501
I want it. Done!

39:30.501 --> 39:33.251
I don't mean to disagree with you

39:34.251 --> 39:37.501
But Luke is Chuck's blood-brother,

39:37.501 --> 39:39.792
and he's willing to give him the candidacy

39:39.792 --> 39:42.292
So Chuck should be a pretty good boss

39:46.001 --> 39:47.126
I understand

39:47.292 --> 39:49.042
Spare me some time

39:49.292 --> 39:52.209
I'll prove to you why I deserve your nomination

39:53.334 --> 39:54.667
That's the right thing to do!

39:54.917 --> 39:58.417
Nobody can complain that
we never give the young a chance

39:58.626 --> 40:00.376
That's true!

40:02.626 --> 40:03.792
Thank you all!

40:04.334 --> 40:05.876
Hey!

40:10.792 --> 40:12.917
Ask not what Jing Hing can do for you;

40:14.834 --> 40:17.126
ask what you can do for Jing Hing

40:24.667 --> 40:26.042
It's OK, take the goods in

40:28.959 --> 40:31.834
Wrap the goods, quick!

40:32.126 --> 40:33.417
Keep an eye on them!

40:38.917 --> 40:40.167
Make it quick

41:26.501 --> 41:28.084
Bye, Daddy!

41:29.126 --> 41:30.542
Did you hear that?

41:30.667 --> 41:32.542
My son called me "Daddy"

41:32.709 --> 41:34.917
And more and more kids call me boss

41:34.917 --> 41:36.334
It has only taken us a few months...

41:36.417 --> 41:38.792
to double the income of "Metal"

41:38.792 --> 41:41.626
They won't have any excuse not to nominate me

41:41.626 --> 41:44.792
I'm earning my 5 lost years back

42:00.626 --> 42:02.459
What brings you here, Chuck?

42:02.626 --> 42:04.292
Not your massage service

42:04.292 --> 42:08.001
We're taking over this place

42:08.001 --> 42:10.667
Call Luke if there's any trouble

42:10.834 --> 42:13.167
But we're already looked after, Chuck

42:13.167 --> 42:14.751
Of course you are!

42:14.751 --> 42:17.584
That's why I came to tell you
this place has changed hands

42:17.584 --> 42:19.084
Fxxk you!

42:20.001 --> 42:22.501
Everything has changed and so have we

42:22.501 --> 42:24.084
The Triad society must change, too

42:24.084 --> 42:26.792
The Triads had nothing to do
after the downfall of the Qing Dynasty,

42:27.126 --> 42:29.334
and were forced to go into shady businesses

42:29.917 --> 42:33.501
Not everyone can stick to
what he first started for

42:33.501 --> 42:35.709
Because some can't see too far

42:35.709 --> 42:38.417
You can really do anything to get what you want

42:38.417 --> 42:41.501
You don't know where to stop, Chuck,
because you've just got out

42:41.501 --> 42:44.834
These blocks have always been ours, Lei Hing

42:44.834 --> 42:46.584
What is "have always been"?

42:46.584 --> 42:48.876
Have you been in charge here
since you were a school kid?

42:49.501 --> 42:51.876
Don't tell me we triads can't change the rules

42:51.876 --> 42:53.126
We have no Basic Law

42:53.292 --> 42:55.126
You idiot!

42:55.126 --> 42:57.709
Lei Hing and Jing Hing aren't supposed
to bother each other

42:57.709 --> 42:59.292
That's not how I look at it

42:59.292 --> 43:02.626
Lei Hing and Jing Hing
come from the same source

43:02.626 --> 43:05.001
Does that mean you'll share the money
you make with me?

43:05.001 --> 43:06.501
So, no deal?

43:07.251 --> 43:08.001
Close the gate!

43:37.042 --> 43:38.876
Who's in charge here?

43:39.292 --> 43:41.042
I, Chuck,

43:41.042 --> 43:43.417
not only want to take back what was mine,

43:43.876 --> 43:46.876
but also what was not mine

43:47.209 --> 43:50.751
Mr. Lam, what's your occupation?

43:52.084 --> 43:55.751
He's a very very big boss

43:55.751 --> 43:57.417
Very very big

43:57.417 --> 44:03.417
Big boss of a...very organized organization

44:04.084 --> 44:05.501
Entertainment!

44:05.501 --> 44:07.084
Yes, entertainment business,

44:07.959 --> 44:12.584
also shops protection, drugs

44:12.709 --> 44:13.584
Drugs?

44:14.542 --> 44:15.834
Drug store

44:16.292 --> 44:17.209
Drug store

44:17.209 --> 44:18.959
Drug store!

44:18.959 --> 44:21.501
- It's...
- You know, Causeway Bay

44:21.501 --> 44:24.209
Many many milk powder!

44:25.084 --> 44:27.459
Your father is a very busy man

44:27.459 --> 44:30.084
What does he do with you during your holidays?

44:30.084 --> 44:39.042
He reads me newspapers
and tells me stories about superheroes

44:41.542 --> 44:43.292
Smart boy!

44:43.292 --> 44:46.292
So Mr. Lam, why did you apply to our school?

44:48.084 --> 44:49.417
I love my son

44:50.084 --> 44:51.792
My son is the breast (meaning best)

44:52.126 --> 44:53.626
I want breast (best!)

44:54.709 --> 44:56.334
You are the breast (best)

44:56.334 --> 44:59.334
The school...very organized

44:59.334 --> 45:02.251
My family...very organized!

45:03.126 --> 45:05.084
Are you familiar with our school vision?

45:07.209 --> 45:08.501
What is -sion?

45:08.501 --> 45:10.417
I have no idea!

45:11.501 --> 45:14.709
Sorry, Sir, telephone, sorry, sorry, sorry

45:16.209 --> 45:18.542
Lei Hing's Eugene is making trouble, Chuck

45:18.542 --> 45:19.917
He messed up five of our bars

45:19.917 --> 45:21.792
two of our men were injured

45:22.167 --> 45:24.751
Must you call me on such mickey-mouse business?

45:24.751 --> 45:26.292
I'm meeting with the school principal

45:26.292 --> 45:27.626
Don't you know how to chop, man!

45:27.626 --> 45:30.001
What happened, Mr. Lam?

45:30.334 --> 45:32.001
Oh, you can speak Chinese, Mr. Principal!

45:32.001 --> 45:34.917
That's good

45:35.251 --> 45:37.542
The Philipino maid you hired
really makes no sense

45:37.542 --> 45:40.167
I sent her to Shem Tseng
to buy a barbecued goose

45:40.417 --> 45:43.959
She called and asked if the roast goose
should be chopped

45:43.959 --> 45:45.834
Yeah, right!

45:45.834 --> 45:47.209
Understood

45:47.542 --> 45:49.126
Good for you!

46:45.084 --> 46:48.417
For people like we triads,
other than going out to chop,

46:48.626 --> 46:50.376
we must always be ready to get chopped, too

46:50.501 --> 46:51.709
No reservation required

46:51.709 --> 46:54.209
Two bosses died within 24 hours

46:54.626 --> 46:57.834
Whenever a boss falls like a shooting star,

46:57.834 --> 46:59.001
everyone must start wondering...

46:59.001 --> 47:00.501
who took his life?

47:00.501 --> 47:03.292
Coke's funeral must be decent and proper, OK?

47:03.292 --> 47:04.667
Hello, hello, hello?

47:04.917 --> 47:06.959
It is most important to bring back my dog!

47:08.251 --> 47:09.709
The doctor has arrived

47:10.251 --> 47:11.792
The report came out

47:12.001 --> 47:15.292
It's not looking good at all,
you'd better be prepared

47:15.292 --> 47:17.876
No more shit, how much time is left?

47:18.001 --> 47:20.584
Your cancer has spread

47:20.792 --> 47:22.584
About a year

47:22.876 --> 47:25.209
A year? Can't be any more than that?

47:25.334 --> 47:27.167
- 12 months
- Fxxk!

47:27.251 --> 47:30.459
I suspect Coke was taken down by Wulf

47:31.001 --> 47:32.626
But people out there think I did it

47:32.626 --> 47:33.626
It fxxking hurts!

47:33.626 --> 47:34.751
I admit...

47:34.792 --> 47:37.167
I thought of doing it, but didn't

47:38.084 --> 47:40.126
Have you got those uncles settled?

47:40.667 --> 47:43.209
Especially that Godfather,
he's always a pain in the ass

47:45.126 --> 47:48.876
Godfather thinks Chuck killed Coke

47:50.251 --> 47:52.376
Everybody out there is alert and anxious

47:52.709 --> 47:54.917
I'd better get more men to protect you

47:57.501 --> 48:02.251
Do you remember "negative selection"
that a professor taught us about?

48:03.334 --> 48:04.042
Yeah

48:04.751 --> 48:06.626
A person at the core of power...

48:07.251 --> 48:11.417
always pick incapable people
to run in an election,

48:11.417 --> 48:15.709
simply to make sure that nobody
can disrupt his power structure

48:17.001 --> 48:20.417
That's why. Godfather is worried that
you're too smart for him

48:22.751 --> 48:24.792
I don't want him feel intimidated by me

48:26.709 --> 48:28.876
I want to earn his "like"

48:44.626 --> 48:46.376
Welcome to Club Mix, Godfather

48:46.376 --> 48:47.876
Happy birthday!

48:48.459 --> 48:49.459
Happy birthday!

48:51.626 --> 48:53.167
Godfather, we have a spa,

48:53.167 --> 48:55.084
Mahjong, karaoke, clubbing

48:55.167 --> 48:55.917
Not bad

48:57.167 --> 49:00.167
But this is most profitable:

49:01.376 --> 49:03.001
Debt rescheduling

49:03.001 --> 49:04.042
Focusing on loans to the police

49:04.042 --> 49:05.667
No identification papers required

49:05.667 --> 49:07.917
All we need is your ID card and mobile number

49:07.917 --> 49:10.001
Express service for the disciplinary force

49:11.001 --> 49:13.751
Isn't the ID card an identification paper?

49:19.251 --> 49:21.542
Happy birthday, Godfather

49:21.959 --> 49:24.834
Happy birthday, Godfather

49:25.334 --> 49:28.376
Wishing you a long and blessed life, Godfather

49:28.376 --> 49:30.667
Ying of "Water"

49:30.959 --> 49:33.292
Many good years are yet
to come for you,

49:33.292 --> 49:34.667
- Godfather
- Thank you!

49:34.667 --> 49:36.959
- Long of "Wood"
- Right!

49:37.917 --> 49:39.084
For you, Godfather!

49:39.959 --> 49:41.584
Long life to you!

49:41.584 --> 49:43.667
Sai Wah of "Earth",he's the new Head

49:47.292 --> 49:48.001
Godfather

49:48.042 --> 49:49.834
Uncle Sky, Uncle Earth, and Uncle Man
are waiting for you in the VIP room

49:49.834 --> 49:51.459
Did I say something wrong?

49:52.001 --> 49:53.292
How the hell would I know?

50:07.709 --> 50:10.667
Chuck is going in with his gang, Sir

50:16.542 --> 50:18.917
All those with the right
to vote for Dragon Head,

50:18.917 --> 50:21.459
other than the 4 old farts,
are the 5 gang leaders

50:21.459 --> 50:24.834
Uncle Earth and Uncle Man have
borrowed nearly 10 million from me

50:25.334 --> 50:27.334
They'll have to pay me back with their votes,
if not their loan interest,

50:27.417 --> 50:30.167
which means I have 4 votes in hand now

50:30.292 --> 50:32.167
Just 1 more vote...

50:32.251 --> 50:33.667
is all I need to win

50:33.709 --> 50:36.792
It seems that Godfather is on your side

50:43.376 --> 50:45.042
That asshole Chuck has arrived

50:52.251 --> 50:53.542
Chuck!

50:53.667 --> 50:55.292
You're very late

50:55.834 --> 50:57.542
We haven't met, have we?

50:57.792 --> 50:59.417
- Who is he?
- Fxxk!

50:59.542 --> 51:01.876
Wulf of "Fire"

51:02.084 --> 51:04.834
Wulf! Oh, I've heard of you

51:04.917 --> 51:06.584
The handsome triad prince!

51:08.042 --> 51:08.834
Is Godfather here?

51:08.834 --> 51:10.876
He's in the VIP room

51:11.001 --> 51:12.292
- Let's take our presents to him
- Hey!

51:13.209 --> 51:16.292
He's in the middle of a meeting
about the Dragon Head election

51:16.292 --> 51:17.709
Please don't interrupt

51:17.709 --> 51:18.917
What is there to talk about?

51:19.251 --> 51:20.834
No one fights better than we "Metal" guys

51:21.167 --> 51:24.709
Nowadays we prefer intelligence, Luke

51:24.709 --> 51:25.709
Kiddo!

51:26.167 --> 51:28.042
Triads always go for outstanding fighters!

51:28.042 --> 51:29.709
Intelligent men should gather...
under the Canal Road Flyover to play chess

51:47.251 --> 51:48.417
Fellas

51:48.501 --> 51:51.251
Godfather and the 3 uncles have
come to a consensus that...

51:51.251 --> 51:54.376
the electoral candidates are...

51:58.792 --> 52:00.084
Wulf and Chuck

52:03.959 --> 52:07.251
The election is to be conducted
10 days from now

52:17.584 --> 52:19.959
- Uncle Sky, cheers!
- Cheers!

52:23.376 --> 52:25.126
This bottle is for here

52:25.876 --> 52:27.751
And this is for you

52:27.834 --> 52:29.001
Take it home and enjoy it

52:32.959 --> 52:34.751
Thank you

52:37.001 --> 52:38.626
I told you, I don't aim at these things

52:38.626 --> 52:39.459
Of course not!

52:39.584 --> 52:42.917
You can't beat Wulf with that

52:45.167 --> 52:48.792
I practice Taichi, I believe in equilibrium

52:48.792 --> 52:52.917
An election is supposed to keep
the balance of power

52:53.584 --> 52:55.917
What's most important now is...

52:56.292 --> 52:57.834
to piss off Godfather

52:58.417 --> 53:00.042
All these years,

53:00.459 --> 53:02.626
the fun of sitting on top of a million men...

53:02.626 --> 53:05.626
has been overshadowed by bending under one

53:06.792 --> 53:08.084
The pleasure isn't mine

53:08.084 --> 53:09.334
Certainly not!

53:09.959 --> 53:11.042
Cheers!

53:17.167 --> 53:20.376
The bosses of both "Water" and "Earth"
are from rich families

53:20.376 --> 53:22.334
They never care about money

53:22.334 --> 53:24.417
This is even easier

53:24.626 --> 53:25.792
Drugs and pretty

53:27.376 --> 53:29.667
So their votes are mine

53:30.959 --> 53:33.167
Wulf used to be an undercover cop

53:33.459 --> 53:34.542
I know!

53:35.001 --> 53:37.876
Once a cop, now a triad boss

53:37.959 --> 53:39.834
Fxxk! Do you expect him
to tell you if he's still a cop?

53:41.084 --> 53:43.751
Once a "25 man" (meaning insider),
always a "25 man"!

53:43.751 --> 53:45.084
Don't worry!

53:45.417 --> 53:48.001
We "Wood" and you "Metal"...

53:48.001 --> 53:50.542
are in the same boat, sharing the same goal

53:51.376 --> 53:53.417
OK! Big bucks forever!

53:58.001 --> 54:00.876
Sign this memo for me, Daddy

54:01.334 --> 54:02.626
Memo?

54:02.959 --> 54:04.001
Let me see

54:05.417 --> 54:07.084
Sign here, right?

54:07.959 --> 54:10.417
You haven't put down
your student number yet. What is it?

54:10.751 --> 54:12.376
25

54:13.626 --> 54:15.084
25?

54:15.667 --> 54:17.626
How is it possible my son is
a "25" (meaning insider)?

54:17.876 --> 54:20.292
Tell Mom to get you a new number
in school tomorrow!

54:20.292 --> 54:22.334
- Clear?
- Yes!

54:23.626 --> 54:24.834
I hate "25" boys

54:26.959 --> 54:28.584
I thought you quit smoking

54:29.084 --> 54:31.126
Nonsense!

54:31.126 --> 54:33.667
I heard that you've been doing
good business recently

54:33.876 --> 54:36.417
Well, double-figure increases every month

54:36.584 --> 54:38.501
Thanks for your help

54:39.459 --> 54:41.459
I need your help, too

54:41.667 --> 54:44.084
There have been lots of rumors
about Jing Hing lately

54:44.084 --> 54:47.667
An election is coming up, that's why

54:47.667 --> 54:49.251
What for?

54:49.501 --> 54:53.001
It's always the same old farts running
the same old show anyway

54:53.084 --> 54:53.834
No!

54:54.376 --> 54:58.542
When I get in, it'll be a whole new show

54:58.542 --> 55:00.459
My men are working their asses off,

55:00.834 --> 55:04.751
all because of Jing Hing

55:04.751 --> 55:06.334
Whining and complaints everyday

55:06.626 --> 55:09.084
It's all that Chuck guy's fault

55:14.251 --> 55:17.251
I want a soft landing when I retire

55:17.251 --> 55:20.251
You must help me to maintain stability

55:20.876 --> 55:23.626
That's why I asked...

55:24.792 --> 55:26.834
to chat with you here, Mr. Xu

55:27.209 --> 55:29.334
If you could get rid of Chuck,

55:29.334 --> 55:30.751
and bring order out of chaos for me,

55:30.834 --> 55:32.667
as soon as I take over,
I guarantee no more trouble

55:32.667 --> 55:34.542
You have my word

55:51.751 --> 55:53.792
- Have you seen this?
- Chuck

55:54.042 --> 55:56.001
- Don't make trouble here, please!
- What are you talking about?

55:56.084 --> 55:58.001
Our boss is Wulf

55:58.376 --> 56:01.501
Please get out if you're not having fun

56:01.834 --> 56:05.167
Put this on Wulf's tab, OK?

56:05.626 --> 56:08.001
Fxxk off!

56:08.001 --> 56:11.126
Fxxk! You...why did you
come across to this side?

56:11.834 --> 56:14.792
We didn't come to get drunk

56:14.959 --> 56:16.667
We came to make trouble!

56:16.667 --> 56:18.001
Fxxk you, asslicker

56:18.167 --> 56:19.501
Bugger off!

56:19.542 --> 56:20.626
Go away!

56:21.667 --> 56:23.292
Get lost!

56:23.292 --> 56:25.084
Fxxk you

56:39.167 --> 56:41.584
Wulf, Chuck is filling our place

56:41.584 --> 56:42.417
Where is he?

56:42.417 --> 56:43.459
Over there

56:43.751 --> 56:46.709
Chuck's men have taken all the tables, Wulf

56:49.001 --> 56:50.292
Howdy, Chuck?

56:50.917 --> 56:53.667
Is there anything not to your liking?
So few drinks!

56:53.667 --> 56:55.584
How about I send all the girls over for you?

56:56.959 --> 56:58.584
As the election is around the corner

56:58.584 --> 57:00.501
I have to come visit the neighborhood,
check out the bars,

57:00.501 --> 57:02.501
Do some lobbying

57:02.917 --> 57:05.001
Only you and I are eligible for votes

57:06.001 --> 57:08.584
Lobbying? How about lobbying me!

57:10.876 --> 57:13.167
Do you know why I came with my gang?

57:13.501 --> 57:15.126
Because I'm scared

57:15.834 --> 57:18.167
In fact, I came to beg you

57:21.292 --> 57:24.376
I joined Jing Hing in Grade 9,

57:24.834 --> 57:27.459
and have always wanted to serve it

57:28.209 --> 57:32.001
Coffee and I were put in jail
on the same day, you must know that

57:32.001 --> 57:34.667
7 years for me, 5 for him

57:34.667 --> 57:36.751
But I hated going to jail,

57:36.959 --> 57:39.584
so I tried hard not to make trouble in there,

57:39.584 --> 57:40.876
hoping to get out sooner

57:41.084 --> 57:43.751
I held myself back every time
I saw that shithole

57:44.209 --> 57:46.501
But he did the opposite

57:46.501 --> 57:48.501
My grandpa was right

57:48.501 --> 57:50.751
He said I was born tough,

57:50.751 --> 57:52.709
so I survive, no matter what

57:53.667 --> 57:56.834
I got out on time, but Coffee's term
got longer and longer

57:56.834 --> 58:01.001
Finally, we were released on the same day

58:01.792 --> 58:04.042
Not only that, I saw him killed right
in front of me

58:04.042 --> 58:06.792
Fxxk! Blood was all over the place!

58:06.792 --> 58:08.917
I was frightened,

58:09.126 --> 58:10.626
wondering...

58:11.459 --> 58:15.042
if even God wanted me
to continue being what I am?

58:16.042 --> 58:17.501
That day I got out,

58:17.501 --> 58:19.626
thinking to go home to fxxk my wife,

58:19.834 --> 58:21.126
but she didn't let me

58:21.126 --> 58:22.501
So I left home to fxxk somebody else

58:22.709 --> 58:23.917
Then I bumped into this hot chick

58:23.917 --> 58:25.709
She danced, this and that. It was wonderful!

58:25.709 --> 58:27.876
I took her to a hotel, I kept screwing...

58:27.876 --> 58:28.751
and was just about to jerk off

58:28.751 --> 58:31.626
Suddenly she asked me to stop,
and wanted to tell my fortune

58:31.751 --> 58:33.834
"What? You can't be serious?"

58:33.834 --> 58:37.542
She said it is best to tell a man's fortune
at that very moment

58:37.834 --> 58:39.542
She said my fortune told that...

58:40.001 --> 58:43.376
I would be Jing Hing's next Dragon Head

58:44.459 --> 58:47.876
Triads are always most superstitious

58:48.751 --> 58:51.501
Therefore, with these signs
and scent and all that,

58:51.501 --> 58:54.584
if I wasn't the one,

58:55.084 --> 58:57.584
who was? You?

59:02.084 --> 59:03.042
Well?

59:03.917 --> 59:05.417
- Finished talking nonsense?
- Yes!

59:05.417 --> 59:07.251
- Finished?
- Yes!

59:07.251 --> 59:08.876
Escort Chuck to the door

59:08.876 --> 59:10.709
No! Your honor

59:11.417 --> 59:14.751
You are still young, and I'm too old

59:14.751 --> 59:16.584
Why don't you let me take the job?

59:16.667 --> 59:18.834
I really want to be elected

59:18.834 --> 59:20.417
Let me tell you what I think

59:20.417 --> 59:22.334
I really fxxking want to
be the Dragon Head, too

59:22.542 --> 59:24.626
Then you're dead!

59:40.584 --> 59:42.709
Fxxk! Are they going to a battle?

59:48.959 --> 59:50.709
Mr. Tsui

59:50.709 --> 59:52.542
Your muscles are very firm,
are you out here patrolling?

59:53.126 --> 59:54.792
Someone reported that the triads
were making trouble

59:54.792 --> 59:57.292
Who are the triads?

59:57.417 --> 59:58.626
Who are the triads?

59:58.709 --> 01:00:01.626
Who are the triads?

01:00:09.792 --> 01:00:12.084
Are you? Identification!

01:00:16.501 --> 01:00:18.042
We're doing our job

01:00:18.167 --> 01:00:20.001
Those who don't want to get involved, leave!

01:00:20.376 --> 01:00:22.417
Those working on a salary must do their job!

01:00:22.417 --> 01:00:24.292
We're going home to hit the sack

01:00:25.334 --> 01:00:28.626
The show is over

01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:32.376
Fxxk! Nutcase, you make no sense

01:00:32.376 --> 01:00:33.292
What did you say?

01:00:33.292 --> 01:00:34.334
- What did you say?
- What?

01:00:34.334 --> 01:00:35.334
Are you a triad?

01:00:35.334 --> 01:00:36.501
Fxxk! I have no idea what you're talking about

01:00:36.501 --> 01:00:37.959
Go get him a lawyer

01:00:38.417 --> 01:00:40.209
- Come out here, if you're with me
- Moron!

01:00:40.459 --> 01:00:42.001
- Are you nuts?
- Are you looking for trouble?

01:00:42.126 --> 01:00:44.626
We're shopping, what has it got to do with you?

01:00:44.876 --> 01:00:46.792
- I could take you in right now
- Stay cool!

01:00:46.792 --> 01:00:48.751
- Fxxk!
- No nonsense!

01:00:48.751 --> 01:00:51.376
I have 3 votes from the uncles

01:00:51.376 --> 01:00:53.417
Both "Water" and "Earth" will go behind my back

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:55.417
Along with my own vote, totally 6

01:00:55.876 --> 01:00:57.584
I've already won

01:01:01.459 --> 01:01:05.584
Hello, Sky? I'm not feeling well,

01:01:05.584 --> 01:01:07.376
I need a check-up in the hospital

01:01:07.542 --> 01:01:09.417
Let's have the vote earlier

01:01:33.126 --> 01:01:34.417
How many of you, Miss?

01:01:34.417 --> 01:01:35.542
I'm looking for someone

01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:37.626
- Who?
- Luke

01:01:37.626 --> 01:01:38.542
Who?

01:01:38.542 --> 01:01:39.376
Luke

01:01:41.501 --> 01:01:42.292
Just a second

01:01:46.209 --> 01:01:47.542
You've lost! This is the one!

01:01:47.542 --> 01:01:48.751
- Drink it!
- Me?

01:01:48.751 --> 01:01:50.792
- Yeah, drink it!
- I just feel thirsty!

01:01:55.792 --> 01:01:58.501
Police! Identification! Music off! Lights on!

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:01.459
What's the problem?

01:02:02.084 --> 01:02:03.959
Shut up!

01:02:04.084 --> 01:02:06.876
Shut up! Everybody on one side!
Against the wall!

01:02:06.876 --> 01:02:08.626
- Against the wall!
- What are you doing?

01:02:08.626 --> 01:02:09.834
Go back to your seat!

01:02:10.251 --> 01:02:12.167
- I want to talk to your boss
- What is this?

01:02:15.209 --> 01:02:16.084
Sir!

01:02:16.084 --> 01:02:18.292
You come in 3 days a week,
we're losing business!

01:02:18.626 --> 01:02:21.084
I need to make sure there are no wet-backs...

01:02:21.084 --> 01:02:22.126
or missing girls hiding here

01:02:23.042 --> 01:02:25.626
This one is underage for sure, Sir!

01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:27.417
Identification! Don't move!!

01:02:27.709 --> 01:02:28.917
Don't be rude, madam!

01:02:29.042 --> 01:02:31.001
This is my duty!

01:02:32.001 --> 01:02:33.417
Stand over there!

01:02:34.126 --> 01:02:35.709
She doesn't work here, we don't know her

01:02:36.001 --> 01:02:37.459
Save it, man!

01:02:42.667 --> 01:02:44.417
Jasmine Atkinson

01:02:46.042 --> 01:02:48.251
You are not 18 yet, and have no work permit

01:02:48.251 --> 01:02:51.626
Do you know tourists working in Hong Kong
is against the law?

01:02:51.751 --> 01:02:53.459
I didn't come here to work

01:02:53.876 --> 01:02:55.459
Then what were you doing in that bar?

01:02:56.376 --> 01:02:58.042
Looking for my dad

01:02:58.709 --> 01:03:00.167
Looking for your dad?

01:03:03.459 --> 01:03:04.959
What now? Can I go?

01:03:04.959 --> 01:03:06.084
You may

01:03:06.501 --> 01:03:08.209
Take your daughter, Jasmine

01:03:08.334 --> 01:03:09.042
What?

01:03:09.084 --> 01:03:10.792
Take your daughter, Jasmine, with you

01:03:12.334 --> 01:03:14.959
Did you have your first love 16 years ago?

01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:17.084
She's Jasmine's mom

01:03:19.126 --> 01:03:20.417
Grandpa and granny sent Mom to the UK...

01:03:20.417 --> 01:03:22.501
when she got pregnant

01:03:22.501 --> 01:03:24.376
They forbade her to stay in touch with you

01:03:26.376 --> 01:03:27.917
How's your mom?

01:03:28.417 --> 01:03:31.250
She married my stepfather when I was 6

01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:33.001
He was pretty nice to me

01:03:33.001 --> 01:03:34.334
But not his daughter

01:03:34.334 --> 01:03:37.501
She's 2 years older;
she bullied me day and night

01:03:38.167 --> 01:03:39.584
How could she? You're so smart!

01:03:40.542 --> 01:03:42.292
How do you know I'm smart?

01:03:42.792 --> 01:03:44.751
You came all the way here to look for me

01:03:44.751 --> 01:03:46.751
And went to the bar all by yourself

01:03:46.959 --> 01:03:48.917
You've travelled even farther away
than your mom

01:03:51.292 --> 01:03:53.751
I found something Mom kept...

01:03:53.751 --> 01:03:55.292
when we moved

01:03:55.834 --> 01:03:57.417
So unexpected

01:03:57.417 --> 01:03:59.126
Did you get her this?

01:04:06.751 --> 01:04:08.042
Yes!

01:04:08.459 --> 01:04:10.334
I made it for her myself

01:04:11.001 --> 01:04:13.334
The technical school I went to...

01:04:13.334 --> 01:04:15.501
was on the next block down
from your mom's prestigious school

01:04:18.042 --> 01:04:19.042
Was she mad at me?

01:04:20.209 --> 01:04:22.167
She never mentioned you

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:25.667
What about you? Are you mad at me?

01:04:28.376 --> 01:04:32.084
I just feel that you owe me a fair childhood

01:04:36.251 --> 01:04:37.667
I'm sorry!

01:04:37.917 --> 01:04:39.626
Back then I really didn't know anything

01:04:40.292 --> 01:04:41.209
When your mom disappeared,

01:04:41.209 --> 01:04:43.501
I really thought she wanted to
stay away from a guy like me

01:04:44.251 --> 01:04:46.167
I know what kind of guy you are

01:04:46.876 --> 01:04:48.126
May I...

01:04:56.584 --> 01:04:59.042
Don't pick a man like me in future

01:04:59.042 --> 01:05:00.709
I find you very cool

01:05:02.834 --> 01:05:04.959
You've watched too many gangster films

01:05:05.417 --> 01:05:06.584
We aren't like that in real life

01:05:07.084 --> 01:05:09.126
Really? What are you like then?

01:05:09.126 --> 01:05:10.251
Which film is closer to real life?

01:05:11.292 --> 01:05:13.501
"Young and Dangerous", "Election",
or "Laughing Gor-Turning Point"?

01:05:13.501 --> 01:05:17.042
Your Cantonese must've come from
these Hong Kong films

01:05:19.042 --> 01:05:21.459
Actually, the reason I returned...

01:05:23.126 --> 01:05:23.834
Hello?

01:05:23.834 --> 01:05:26.167
All of a sudden the oldies
want to vote tonight instead

01:05:26.167 --> 01:05:27.917
Something is going on

01:05:47.001 --> 01:05:49.292
Some people said Wulf spent
80 million to buy votes

01:06:28.792 --> 01:06:31.459
We'll call out the names selected

01:06:37.292 --> 01:06:38.126
Wulf

01:06:45.834 --> 01:06:46.542
Chuck

01:06:53.751 --> 01:06:54.542
Wulf

01:07:01.876 --> 01:07:02.584
Chuck

01:07:11.542 --> 01:07:12.376
Wulf

01:07:21.459 --> 01:07:22.792
Wulf

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:28.376
One more for Wulf to win

01:07:29.667 --> 01:07:31.042
This isn't the right way to vote!

01:07:31.584 --> 01:07:32.876
This isn't fair!

01:07:32.876 --> 01:07:33.959
Give me that!

01:07:34.501 --> 01:07:36.001
What are you doing? You can't afford to lose?

01:07:36.001 --> 01:07:36.917
Yes, I can!

01:07:37.209 --> 01:07:38.501
But not this way!

01:07:38.626 --> 01:07:40.417
Don't you see what the problem is?

01:07:40.501 --> 01:07:43.251
So many of us have been with Jing Hing
for so many years

01:07:43.501 --> 01:07:46.792
Why are only 9 men eligible to vote
when it comes to picking a Dragon Head?

01:07:46.792 --> 01:07:48.501
Fxxk! Might as well not vote!

01:07:48.667 --> 01:07:50.459
If we have a vote, every one of us
should be eligible

01:07:59.084 --> 01:08:01.834
There has never been such a rule for Jing Hing

01:08:02.001 --> 01:08:03.667
Put that bowl down

01:08:03.667 --> 01:08:04.626
Continue!

01:08:05.459 --> 01:08:07.334
Hey! Stop that

01:08:08.709 --> 01:08:10.792
The votes he swallowed are invalid, Godfather

01:08:10.792 --> 01:08:12.751
It's 4 to 2 now, I win!

01:08:12.751 --> 01:08:14.251
I'm Jing Hing's new Dragon Head

01:08:14.251 --> 01:08:15.667
To hell with you!

01:08:15.667 --> 01:08:17.542
How dare you tell Godfather what to do!

01:08:17.667 --> 01:08:19.751
How dare you collude with the police...

01:08:19.751 --> 01:08:21.167
and infringe on we blood brothers' benefits

01:08:21.167 --> 01:08:22.084
You are a "25 man" (meaning insider)

01:08:22.084 --> 01:08:23.042
What are you talking about?

01:08:23.042 --> 01:08:23.834
You liar!

01:08:23.834 --> 01:08:26.334
PC6722! You're a "25 man"

01:08:26.334 --> 01:08:28.459
What are you talking about?

01:08:28.626 --> 01:08:29.334
Fight me!

01:08:29.417 --> 01:08:31.542
Fighting in Godfather's presence
is very disrespectful!

01:08:31.542 --> 01:08:33.209
Teddy-boys don't do that,

01:08:33.334 --> 01:08:34.167
the police do

01:08:36.167 --> 01:08:38.334
You are of high virtue and respect, Godfather

01:08:38.334 --> 01:08:40.292
You set up the rules of our election

01:08:40.292 --> 01:08:41.417
But do you know everything is 1-man-1-vote

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:43.459
out there in the world?

01:08:43.459 --> 01:08:46.667
Concerts in the Hung Horn Coliseum
are also 1-man-1-ticket

01:08:48.001 --> 01:08:49.709
I'm a small potato

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:51.709
You may veto me

01:08:52.042 --> 01:08:54.001
But can you veto our time

01:08:57.542 --> 01:08:58.792
Brothers

01:08:59.709 --> 01:09:01.417
A chosen Dragon Head...

01:09:01.542 --> 01:09:04.834
can infringe on all your benefits!

01:09:06.001 --> 01:09:08.501
Why are only a few men eligible to vote?

01:09:08.917 --> 01:09:11.251
Why not 1-man-1-vote?

01:09:12.792 --> 01:09:14.334
I'm asking you

01:09:14.959 --> 01:09:16.459
Do you want the right to vote?

01:09:36.626 --> 01:09:38.126
I do!

01:09:40.584 --> 01:10:10.834
I do!

01:10:11.584 --> 01:10:14.126
Your voice is heard

01:10:14.126 --> 01:10:16.042
So fxxking loud

01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:22.001
Everyone return to where you belong to vote...

01:10:22.751 --> 01:10:25.459
3 days from now

01:10:27.251 --> 01:10:28.542
1-man-1-vote

01:10:29.001 --> 01:10:32.792
Hurray!

01:10:32.792 --> 01:10:34.251
Thank you!

01:10:38.792 --> 01:10:40.876
Make the right choice and
vote for the right man

01:10:40.876 --> 01:10:42.376
I'm Chuck, yes!

01:10:43.001 --> 01:10:44.167
Take a look, dude!

01:10:44.167 --> 01:10:46.542
A book I read in jail says...

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:50.209
change must happen in history,

01:10:50.334 --> 01:10:52.876
yet whoever happens to be the hero...

01:10:53.001 --> 01:10:54.167
is incidental

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:57.792
It could be Dick, it could be Harry,

01:10:57.959 --> 01:10:59.667
It could be Chuck

01:10:59.917 --> 01:11:02.042
I think I have changed history

01:11:02.292 --> 01:11:04.709
Please vote for me, Chuck...

01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:06.209
to be the next Dragon Head, fellas!

01:11:06.209 --> 01:11:10.334
In future, will my name...

01:11:10.459 --> 01:11:11.792
appear in the Triad Section
of the police museum?

01:11:11.792 --> 01:11:13.001
I'm Chuck

01:11:13.209 --> 01:11:15.709
Please cast your sacred vote for me, thank you

01:11:15.917 --> 01:11:17.334
Where are you from, young man?

01:11:17.334 --> 01:11:18.417
Jing Hing, Chuck

01:11:18.417 --> 01:11:20.167
Perfect! Please vote for me

01:11:20.459 --> 01:11:21.959
Thank you

01:11:24.084 --> 01:11:25.251
Your wife called, Chuck

01:11:25.251 --> 01:11:27.126
She said it's Chuck Junior's birthday tomorrow;
go home for supper

01:11:27.126 --> 01:11:28.251
I remember that

01:11:28.459 --> 01:11:30.084
I'm leaving

01:11:30.084 --> 01:11:31.626
OK! Wooing hot chicks?

01:11:31.626 --> 01:11:33.459
- Good for you!
- So long!

01:11:35.001 --> 01:11:36.834
Are you a triad?

01:12:06.626 --> 01:12:08.584
Are you a Jing Hing member?

01:12:09.167 --> 01:12:10.751
Gonna vote?

01:12:11.834 --> 01:12:13.376
Come on!

01:12:14.001 --> 01:12:16.376
Give it a try, a little try

01:12:54.417 --> 01:12:55.709
- Hello?
- Chuck

01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:56.959
Wulf ordered not to charge fees of any kind...

01:12:56.959 --> 01:12:59.834
for any Jing Hing members applying for loans...

01:12:59.834 --> 01:13:01.751
from his finance company

01:13:01.751 --> 01:13:03.792
The interest-free period
got extended indefinitely, too

01:13:04.167 --> 01:13:07.584
30% off in my massage parlor, free hand-jobs!

01:13:08.542 --> 01:13:10.584
I was on the phone!

01:13:18.876 --> 01:13:19.834
How is she, doctor?

01:13:19.834 --> 01:13:21.667
Your daughter has serious kidney failure

01:13:21.667 --> 01:13:22.959
She needs long-term dialysis,

01:13:22.959 --> 01:13:24.459
and isn't fit for a long trip

01:13:24.459 --> 01:13:26.417
Don't let her do that again

01:13:26.917 --> 01:13:28.417
Thank you, doctor

01:13:35.334 --> 01:13:36.626
Thank you

01:13:57.001 --> 01:13:59.167
You shouldn't have come...

01:13:59.459 --> 01:14:01.834
such along way to me. You're ill

01:14:02.917 --> 01:14:04.792
I came...

01:14:04.792 --> 01:14:07.042
to beg you to go to the UK with me

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:08.501
I need your kidney

01:14:11.876 --> 01:14:13.709
Mom's doesn't fit

01:14:14.126 --> 01:14:16.584
I'm not on the priority list,
only God knows how long I need to wait

01:14:17.126 --> 01:14:19.417
You didn't give me my childhood

01:14:19.917 --> 01:14:22.001
Will you give me my future?

01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:26.834
I study well in school

01:14:27.542 --> 01:14:29.584
I work very hard

01:14:30.667 --> 01:14:33.292
I know I can get into Oxbridge

01:14:34.042 --> 01:14:36.626
I really don't want to
die right after university

01:14:38.376 --> 01:14:40.376
I haven't had any relationship,

01:14:41.126 --> 01:14:43.626
and there are many things I want to do

01:15:02.167 --> 01:15:03.792
I owe you all that

01:15:10.542 --> 01:15:11.917
Are you a good boy today?

01:15:11.917 --> 01:15:13.876
- Yes!
- Yeah?

01:15:16.292 --> 01:15:17.251
Get in the car

01:15:17.251 --> 01:15:18.667
Be careful

01:15:20.042 --> 01:15:21.292
Hello!

01:15:21.751 --> 01:15:23.459
See what I've got you

01:15:23.459 --> 01:15:25.584
Happy birthday! Do you like it?

01:15:25.584 --> 01:15:26.709
Yes!

01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:32.792
Well, what are we having for supper tonight?

01:15:33.084 --> 01:15:34.459
I thought you had arranged that

01:15:35.126 --> 01:15:36.834
You called to remind me for supper, man

01:15:36.834 --> 01:15:39.501
I meant to remind you to make a reservation
for what you like to eat

01:15:40.209 --> 01:15:41.959
Don't tell me you made no reservation

01:15:41.959 --> 01:15:44.917
I'm just responsible for paying,
not to make a reservation,

01:15:44.917 --> 01:15:45.959
All right, no supper then!

01:15:45.959 --> 01:15:48.334
It's a public holiday today, we can't go
anywhere without a reservation

01:15:48.667 --> 01:15:50.501
No exceptions for a big boss

01:15:52.542 --> 01:15:56.417
I don't want to argue on
our son's birthday, I'll do it now

01:15:56.417 --> 01:15:57.501
"Open Rice", right?

01:16:00.834 --> 01:16:03.751
Get me back my car, Mom

01:16:03.751 --> 01:16:05.459
Naughty boy

01:16:05.459 --> 01:16:08.209
- Where is it?
- The bottom of your chair!

01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:09.584
Just a second

01:16:16.167 --> 01:16:18.251
So much garbage!

01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:21.667
How about Chiu Chow food?

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:30.084
What is this?

01:16:33.626 --> 01:16:36.001
Don't tell me it's a cleaning cloth!

01:16:41.417 --> 01:16:43.417
Let's be civilized parents

01:16:44.042 --> 01:16:45.751
Don't quarrel in front of our kid, OK?

01:16:49.209 --> 01:16:50.126
OK!

01:16:56.084 --> 01:16:58.876
What are we going to eat, Dad?

01:17:06.251 --> 01:17:07.751
What does your mom want?

01:17:07.751 --> 01:17:10.376
No WhatsApp, no calls, nothing

01:17:11.751 --> 01:17:13.459
She's mad at you

01:17:13.459 --> 01:17:15.834
Because you're naughty!

01:17:15.834 --> 01:17:18.251
I was like that even before she married me

01:17:18.251 --> 01:17:19.792
Why did she still marry me?

01:17:21.209 --> 01:17:23.251
Did she say I'm naughty?

01:17:23.667 --> 01:17:27.751
Mom said you went to jail

01:17:27.751 --> 01:17:29.584
Is it true?

01:17:32.459 --> 01:17:36.001
Of course I did, so what?

01:17:36.001 --> 01:17:37.959
Many high-ranking officials
have gone to jail, too

01:17:37.959 --> 01:17:42.501
But teacher said only bad people go to jail!

01:17:42.501 --> 01:17:45.167
Well, your teacher was too superficial

01:17:45.584 --> 01:17:48.001
There are many goods among the bads

01:17:48.001 --> 01:17:50.834
Yeah? Are there bads among the goods, too?

01:17:50.834 --> 01:17:51.959
Even more!

01:17:53.251 --> 01:17:55.584
But you won't understand it until you grow up

01:17:55.584 --> 01:17:57.834
But I want to understand it now

01:17:59.167 --> 01:18:01.751
It's just like this dessert,
is it black or white?

01:18:02.751 --> 01:18:03.876
Black

01:18:03.876 --> 01:18:05.126
Then you're too superficial

01:18:05.126 --> 01:18:07.917
Look, there is white, too

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:10.501
That's why...

01:18:11.751 --> 01:18:12.834
Sweetie!

01:18:15.001 --> 01:18:16.251
Mom!

01:18:28.126 --> 01:18:29.292
Run!

01:18:29.667 --> 01:18:30.501
Run!

01:18:31.167 --> 01:18:32.084
Run!

01:18:43.292 --> 01:18:44.459
Freeze!

01:18:44.459 --> 01:18:45.626
Drop the knife!

01:18:46.084 --> 01:18:47.417
It's OK, don't be scared!

01:18:47.417 --> 01:18:49.334
Where's your medicine? Your medicine?

01:18:49.334 --> 01:18:50.126
Is he all right?

01:18:50.126 --> 01:18:53.001
Call an ambulance! Ambulance!

01:18:53.001 --> 01:18:53.876
Calling control!

01:18:53.876 --> 01:18:55.626
Junction of Kwong Wa Street
and Yin Chong Street

01:18:55.626 --> 01:18:57.542
A boy is injured, calling for backup, over

01:18:57.542 --> 01:18:58.751
It's all right!

01:19:02.209 --> 01:19:03.834
Do you know who the killers are?

01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:06.542
No!

01:19:07.626 --> 01:19:10.751
Have you offended anyone lately?
Do you have any enemies?

01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:17.459
I'm no policeman like you

01:19:18.334 --> 01:19:20.251
You know what I do

01:19:21.001 --> 01:19:22.626
I'm no policeman like you

01:19:23.626 --> 01:19:26.584
I was running in the street,
What has it got to do with you?

01:19:26.584 --> 01:19:28.542
Why did you save me?

01:19:28.959 --> 01:19:30.334
Chuck Lam!

01:19:30.626 --> 01:19:32.251
You triad asshole!

01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:34.501
No matter how much an asshole you are,

01:19:34.501 --> 01:19:36.001
I would still save you!

01:19:36.417 --> 01:19:38.084
Because I'm a policeman!

01:19:41.709 --> 01:19:45.042
Your son suffered an asthma attack;
he was taken in too late

01:20:42.334 --> 01:20:45.709
[Chuck Calling]

01:21:11.501 --> 01:21:14.334
[Passport of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region]

01:21:14.334 --> 01:21:17.376
[British National (Overseas) passport]

01:21:29.376 --> 01:21:32.001
[Chuck Calling]

01:21:32.167 --> 01:21:35.459
[Missed Call]

01:21:42.792 --> 01:21:44.667
I couldn't find Luke

01:21:44.667 --> 01:21:45.917
Call in all our men

01:21:50.334 --> 01:21:52.292
There won't be any more "Fire" gang...

01:21:52.292 --> 01:21:54.542
after tomorrow

01:21:55.501 --> 01:21:58.042
Let's wipe them all out tonight, deal?

01:21:58.042 --> 01:21:59.626
Deal!

01:21:59.626 --> 01:22:01.876
Excuse me!

01:22:01.876 --> 01:22:04.417
I'm out, Chuck!

01:22:04.417 --> 01:22:05.376
I want to join you!

01:22:05.751 --> 01:22:06.667
Perfect timing!

01:22:06.667 --> 01:22:08.376
From time to time,
there are always capable youngsters

01:22:10.042 --> 01:22:11.584
I'm counting on you!

01:22:11.584 --> 01:22:12.876
Thank you, boss

01:22:14.292 --> 01:22:16.584
We'll change history tonight, shall we?

01:22:16.584 --> 01:22:17.792
Yes!

01:22:17.792 --> 01:22:21.667
Jing Hing will not be the same from now on

01:22:23.501 --> 01:22:25.042
Remember this

01:22:25.042 --> 01:22:26.834
The first kill is the most difficult

01:22:26.834 --> 01:22:28.626
After that you won't want to stop

01:22:39.001 --> 01:22:42.542
What's for Jing Hing tonight?

01:22:43.167 --> 01:22:45.542
You'd better help to maintain order,
cool things down

01:22:47.251 --> 01:22:48.917
Do you think I can do it?

01:22:52.876 --> 01:22:55.959
Chuck and Wulf want no Dragon Head

01:22:56.126 --> 01:22:58.042
They want to seize power

01:22:58.792 --> 01:23:02.001
They do not respect us,

01:23:02.542 --> 01:23:05.084
keep bragging they want to change

01:23:05.876 --> 01:23:08.584
If they get elected,

01:23:09.042 --> 01:23:11.001
you would have a very hard time, too

01:23:13.876 --> 01:23:16.001
There's nothing I can do

01:23:17.376 --> 01:23:18.584
Quiet!

01:23:19.251 --> 01:23:20.292
Quiet!

01:23:20.584 --> 01:23:21.709
Quiet!

01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:23.001
Everybody be quiet!

01:23:23.292 --> 01:23:24.376
Quiet!

01:23:25.001 --> 01:23:26.501
Everybody be quiet!

01:23:29.417 --> 01:23:31.084
Everybody shut up!

01:23:33.167 --> 01:23:34.501
What are you people doing here?

01:23:34.501 --> 01:23:37.042
Can't we shop and walk here?

01:23:39.001 --> 01:23:40.584
Who's your boss?

01:23:42.667 --> 01:23:44.834
My wife and son died...

01:23:45.292 --> 01:23:47.542
because I want to be elected Dragon Head

01:23:49.167 --> 01:23:51.209
So If I fail,

01:23:51.501 --> 01:23:53.001
their deaths are worth nothing

01:23:53.167 --> 01:23:55.876
It all depends on who they pick

01:23:56.126 --> 01:23:59.542
One-man-one-vote;
it's more fair that way, you said so

01:24:00.334 --> 01:24:02.542
Fair or not is none of my fxxking business

01:24:04.001 --> 01:24:05.542
The choice isn't theirs

01:24:05.542 --> 01:24:09.126
You and I are chosen by the uncles

01:24:09.667 --> 01:24:11.417
I don't want fairness!

01:24:11.667 --> 01:24:13.834
I want to be the Dragon Head

01:24:14.667 --> 01:24:16.751
Don't we always get along?

01:24:16.751 --> 01:24:18.834
We talk about solving problems

01:24:19.751 --> 01:24:21.667
You wanted someone turned in to close a file

01:24:21.667 --> 01:24:23.084
I'd turn in someone

01:24:23.959 --> 01:24:27.126
You wanted some dirty business done,
I'd get it done for you

01:24:27.459 --> 01:24:29.626
No charge

01:24:31.626 --> 01:24:34.792
Everything is in good order,
harmonious, and stable

01:24:38.042 --> 01:24:41.709
Chuck and Wulf are going
to finish each other tonight

01:24:42.084 --> 01:24:45.667
One of them is finished for sure,
even better if both are killed

01:24:45.876 --> 01:24:47.626
Don't get between them

01:24:47.626 --> 01:24:49.292
Jing Hing will still need a Dragon Head...

01:24:49.292 --> 01:24:52.042
if they both die

01:24:55.376 --> 01:24:57.376
I am always the Dragon Head

01:24:59.459 --> 01:25:02.001
OK, I know what to do

01:25:04.334 --> 01:25:05.834
Let's go!

01:25:06.542 --> 01:25:10.542
Go!

01:25:10.542 --> 01:25:14.542
No one can tell me what to do
for as long as I live

01:25:15.501 --> 01:25:19.417
Just a yes-man to fill the job.
So many of them to choose from

01:25:21.667 --> 01:25:24.751
Jing Hing will not change,
everything will remain intact

01:25:26.042 --> 01:25:29.292
Police cars and ambulances are just standing by

01:25:29.959 --> 01:25:33.501
The headline tomorrow will be,
"Police smash triads"

01:25:33.501 --> 01:25:37.126
How impressive! A good record for you, too

01:25:38.292 --> 01:25:40.251
Actually I really want to know...

01:25:41.626 --> 01:25:43.626
Did your men kill my wife?

01:25:45.501 --> 01:25:46.751
Did you give the order to kill me?

01:25:50.209 --> 01:25:52.334
Simply "Yes" or "No",
nobody can get away, anyway

01:25:52.917 --> 01:25:54.584
What?

01:25:54.584 --> 01:25:56.792
Nothing to be afraid of, are you?

01:25:56.792 --> 01:25:58.042
Nonsense!

01:25:58.584 --> 01:25:59.959
Don't think I've no guts

01:25:59.959 --> 01:26:01.626
Yes! I did it, so what?

01:26:01.959 --> 01:26:03.042
Then it's time for you to pay back...

01:26:03.042 --> 01:26:04.251
with your whole gang

01:26:04.251 --> 01:26:05.251
Fight!

01:26:06.251 --> 01:26:07.209
Fxxk, fight!

01:26:18.501 --> 01:26:20.876
Time to take action, Sir!

01:26:20.959 --> 01:26:22.417
Don't tell me what to do

01:26:22.417 --> 01:26:23.959
Wait a little longer!

01:26:23.959 --> 01:26:25.501
Plenty of them will die

01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:28.667
It's better for the triads;
they will be less crowded

01:26:31.917 --> 01:26:33.042
You asshole

01:27:08.626 --> 01:27:11.792
Coke took my money, General

01:27:12.251 --> 01:27:14.417
I want him in hell tomorrow

01:27:16.584 --> 01:27:17.834
Copy!

01:27:21.667 --> 01:27:25.459
When Chuck got hurt, guess who's the first guy
he would think of?

01:27:26.042 --> 01:27:27.501
Wulf

01:27:48.667 --> 01:27:50.167
Help!

01:27:50.292 --> 01:27:51.834
Help!

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:56.542
It really hurts! Help!

But teacher said only bad people go to jail!

01:28:48.501 --> 01:28:50.542
Well, your teacher was too superficial

01:28:50.542 --> 01:28:53.042
There are many goods among the bads

Three months after I died,

01:29:53.084 --> 01:29:54.751
Godfather was gone, too

01:29:55.126 --> 01:29:57.001
People said that he died badly

01:29:57.584 --> 01:30:00.292
Piss and shit were all over him in bed

01:30:00.584 --> 01:30:04.042
After all, he died in his own shit
