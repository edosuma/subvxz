WEBVTT

01:36.888 --> 01:39.516
Cows aren't gonna
feed themselves, Maureen!

01:44.229 --> 01:47.232
Someday I'm gonna see you up close.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.195
Don't make me ask twice!

01:53.571 --> 01:54.405
Maureen!

01:54.489 --> 01:55.615
Mom?

01:56.199 --> 01:57.242
Mom?

01:58.660 --> 02:01.287
Do you remember what happened?
I need you to tell me.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.581
SAR followed us into the Rift.

02:03.665 --> 02:06.042
We lost power, and everyone ejected.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.378
At least, everyone was… supposed to.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.338
All right. No slurred speech.

02:10.421 --> 02:14.676
Your memory, your concentration is good.
That rules out contusion or DAI.

02:15.176 --> 02:18.513
I'm gonna try
to contact the others.

02:18.596 --> 02:19.472
No!

02:21.808 --> 02:22.642
Turn that off.

02:25.061 --> 02:26.187
They can track us?

02:26.271 --> 02:28.731
Anything electronic draws them like flies.

02:30.775 --> 02:33.862
Wait here.
I'm gonna see if I can spot the others.

02:35.363 --> 02:38.366
-Hold still. Hold still.

02:43.079 --> 02:44.873
I got you. All right.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.292
There you go.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.219
Make sure to pull the batteries out
of your wrist device too.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.680
-What?
-Pull your batteries out!

03:01.222 --> 03:02.348
Ah! Right.

03:04.809 --> 03:07.395
Do you think SAR and his friends
survived the crash?

03:07.478 --> 03:09.814
Hey, is my wrist device down there?

03:12.192 --> 03:14.444
Yeah, I see it.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.529
-Make sure it's off.
-Oh, it's off.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.704
To answer your question…

03:26.456 --> 03:27.415
Yeah.

03:28.583 --> 03:29.584
They survived.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.200
PSA looks good.

04:02.825 --> 04:06.162
At least from what I can tell
without actually turning it on.

04:06.996 --> 04:10.250
Let's try to get the ship prepped
by the time the others get back.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.379
Shouldn't be a problem.

04:14.462 --> 04:18.132
Of all the people to crash with,
I'm glad I crashed with you.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.217
Don't tell Penny.

04:19.884 --> 04:20.760
Or Will.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.136
Or your father.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.180
Yeah.

04:24.764 --> 04:27.225
-I'm gonna go check on the fuel tanks.
-Okay.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.188
-Judy?
-Yeah?

04:34.983 --> 04:36.859
I think the seat rockets are still armed.

04:36.943 --> 04:37.944
What?

04:40.863 --> 04:42.615
Okay. It's okay. Um…

04:47.203 --> 04:50.748
Okay, talk me through
what I'm supposed to look at.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.544
Are the clamps engaged?

04:55.712 --> 04:56.546
No.

04:57.755 --> 04:59.507
Is the propellant canister intact?

05:00.300 --> 05:03.845
-It's cracked.
-So I'm basically sitting on a land mine.

05:05.888 --> 05:07.432
That's not good.

05:10.059 --> 05:13.980
Okay, um… the sensors
are triggered by weight,

05:14.063 --> 05:16.858
so as long as I stay seated,
they won't go off.

05:18.484 --> 05:19.652
But if I move, I'm dead.

05:20.528 --> 05:23.323
And so are you.
It'll spray shrapnel everywhere.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.491
The rocket's triggered
by the catapult booster?

05:25.575 --> 05:28.536
Yes, but you can't safely disconnect it
when it's armed.

05:28.619 --> 05:31.581
Okay, I could spray liquid helium
in the gap and freeze it.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.875
That would only delay it
for a couple of seconds,

05:33.958 --> 05:35.752
which isn't enough time
for us to get clear.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.254
There isn't any other way
to disarm the system?

05:38.338 --> 05:39.797
I'm sure there is. I just--

05:41.591 --> 05:43.134
I don't know what it is right now.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.391
<i>You look exhausted.</i>

05:50.475 --> 05:52.226
-Oh, thanks, Mom.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.146
Oh!

05:58.983 --> 06:01.444
Aren't you just the sweetest thing?

06:03.821 --> 06:05.573
Nice to meet you, Judy.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.035
Yeah!

06:18.211 --> 06:19.921
I know you're down about your job.

06:21.756 --> 06:25.343
I was gonna be an astronaut.
It's more than just a job.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.970
-Life throws curveballs.

06:32.058 --> 06:35.728
I didn't even get through the first round
of training before I had to bow out.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.399
Well, you're home now, where you belong.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.983
I'm not staying here.

06:41.984 --> 06:47.740
Oh, maybe you can put that engineering
degree to work fixing the harvester.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.081
How did you do that?

06:56.124 --> 06:59.210
Finally,
something I know that you don't.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.176
-Try out the rocker.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.803
Come on.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.736
Babies don't stay babies forever.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.324
There's a lot of outer space up there.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.618
We're not about to run out.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.288
There will be other missions.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.542
No. I'm not gonna risk orphaning Judy.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.211
That's very sensible of you.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.517
I don't know how to do this yet.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.312
But I'm pretty smart.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.316
And you will be too.

08:07.653 --> 08:08.863
We'll figure it out.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.246
It's okay. We'll figure it out.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.463
-Did you find where everyone is?

08:26.088 --> 08:28.466
Jupiter's 20 kilometers to the south.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.052
Looks to be in pretty good shape.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.803
I saw a parachute stuck in the tree,

08:32.887 --> 08:35.389
so we know where
at least one of them came down.

08:35.473 --> 08:36.557
Just one?

08:38.267 --> 08:39.393
Just the one I saw.

08:41.354 --> 08:45.816
The Fortuna's closest,
so, uh… we'll head there first.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.610
Get the robot and the engine.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.445
Did you see any sign of SAR?

08:52.198 --> 08:54.408
That's not something
you need to worry about.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.787
-Dad?
-Yeah.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.289
I'm glad you're here.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.927
Hey, leave the helmet and the hard pack.
We need to move fast.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.477
-Oh!

09:21.561 --> 09:23.854
-Debbie? Deb--

09:24.939 --> 09:26.566
This is what I get for clipping your tag.

09:26.649 --> 09:29.902
You get a little taste of freedom,
first thing you do is abuse it.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.947
-What are you eating?

09:33.030 --> 09:35.533
Do not eat that!

09:36.784 --> 09:38.536
Ugh! That's gross.

09:39.036 --> 09:42.873
You peck my cheek with that mouth.
You are making poor choices.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.500
-What the--

09:45.918 --> 09:46.752
Oh!

09:48.129 --> 09:49.714
Get off me. Get off me!

09:52.049 --> 09:56.304
-What the-- No! Hey, my boot!

09:57.972 --> 09:59.765
Aah! No!

10:00.766 --> 10:03.477
Debbie! No, no, no, no!
Do not go near those things.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.396
Do you hear me? Bad chicken!

10:16.490 --> 10:19.452
Okay, so I didn't get to the fuel tanks,
but I found the helium, so--

10:21.203 --> 10:22.496
What's happening?

10:22.580 --> 10:24.999
-We're sinking.

10:26.208 --> 10:29.378
Look. The ejection hatch.
Something's leaking.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.509
-What is it?

10:45.853 --> 10:46.729
It's saliva.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.570
We're not sinking.

10:55.279 --> 10:56.822
We're being swallowed.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.343
Your robot brought us
to the worst place yet.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.262
You only call him "my robot"
when you're unhappy with him.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.307
Usually, you're trying to remind everyone
how you used to be so close.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.810
We still are, in our own way.

11:32.483 --> 11:36.320
Whatever is in that backpack,
it's not worth it.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.956
Is that a skull?

11:47.540 --> 11:50.000
I found it in the alien city.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.545
-That's a horrible souvenir.

11:52.628 --> 11:53.963
I need it for my plan.

11:55.047 --> 11:58.759
Why do I feel like your plan
is going to get me killed?

12:00.010 --> 12:01.345
No one's gonna get killed.

12:03.514 --> 12:07.435
-Debbie! Debbie! Stop! Stop! Stop!

12:09.228 --> 12:11.021
Stop! Debbie, come here!

12:11.105 --> 12:13.065
I raised you better than this!

12:18.279 --> 12:21.866
As your parent-slash-guardian,

12:21.949 --> 12:23.242
I am ordering you--

12:24.910 --> 12:27.037
-You're gonna get us killed!

12:29.540 --> 12:34.503
I swear, if we make it out of here alive,
you are grounded, young lady!

12:43.053 --> 12:45.222
Daddy loves you.

12:45.973 --> 12:49.101
I got worms. You know, for you to eat.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.567
Debra Abigail West,

12:57.526 --> 12:59.069
I'm gonna count to three.

12:59.153 --> 12:59.987
One,

13:00.905 --> 13:01.781
two,

13:03.115 --> 13:04.283
two and a quarter,

13:05.618 --> 13:06.660
two and a half…

13:30.017 --> 13:32.978
I'm sorry for the bad things I've done
and the people I've hurt.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.074
What are you doing?

13:49.787 --> 13:51.080
Come on!

13:59.296 --> 14:02.633
I didn't think it would be
in so many pieces.

14:03.759 --> 14:04.718
Robot?

14:07.263 --> 14:08.931
Robot? Are you here?

14:12.685 --> 14:14.812
Robot, it's Penny Robinson.

14:14.895 --> 14:17.147
As opposed to
all the other Pennys you know.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.448
The primary
electrical bus has been severed,

14:27.449 --> 14:29.577
which means the ship's dark,
which is good.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.829
The robots won't be able to detect us.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.914
You're using your caveat voice.

14:34.665 --> 14:39.378
All it takes is two live wires to touch,
and they'll know we're here.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.424
Okay, um…

14:44.466 --> 14:46.260
I won't touch any wires, then.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.015
Robot?

15:00.566 --> 15:01.525
Robot?

15:09.199 --> 15:10.367
Where are you?

15:12.202 --> 15:14.371
We really need to get out of here.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.999
-Watch it!

15:21.670 --> 15:23.172
I didn't touch any wires.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.136
Did you just hear that?

15:32.640 --> 15:33.599
Okay.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.267
Hi.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.562
-Are you okay?
-Help.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.902
We need to find something
to cut through this.

15:50.532 --> 15:51.867
Hi.

15:54.411 --> 15:56.997
This is a lot like
when you first met Will, right?

15:58.248 --> 16:01.502
You know, minus the… tree and the fire.

16:01.585 --> 16:04.546
And the fact that you were
a scary four-armed monster at the time.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.637
You know, you're lucky
that you met Will and not me.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.139
I-- I would never have been able
to do what he did.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.353
How did he save you, anyway?

16:20.604 --> 16:23.983
Considering how he went on and on
about his robot, he never told me.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.743
Something on his belt?

16:38.998 --> 16:42.459
Obviously, I can't turn it on,
but if I can jury-rig the blade somehow…

16:46.964 --> 16:48.257
Why didn't I think of that?

16:50.175 --> 16:51.010
Good job.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.054
-Thank you.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.473
What is it?

17:19.788 --> 17:21.915
-Now what?
-Are the fuel lines pressurized?

17:23.208 --> 17:26.503
-Yeah, looks like it.
-Okay. If we release them all at once,

17:26.587 --> 17:30.007
it should make this thing feel like
it's being punched in the throat.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.508
Which will make it throw us up.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.761
Yeah, but the trick is
to reach maximum pressure

17:33.844 --> 17:37.681
without going into the red and triggering
the emergency bleed-off valve.

17:37.765 --> 17:42.102
Okay, so if I wanna get close to the red,
I'm gonna need a pressure gauge.

17:42.186 --> 17:45.105
No! All the ones we have are electronic.
You have to do it by feel.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.607
-By feel?
-Yeah.

17:47.941 --> 17:50.527
Hey. You're Judy Robinson.
You can do anything.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.199
Um… Okay, I need a benchmark.

17:55.282 --> 17:58.911
Um… Well, uh…
you should feel the vibration.

17:59.536 --> 18:02.623
It should feel
a bit like a-- a purring cat.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.875
Okay, a cat? You never let us have a cat.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.418
Will was allergic.

18:07.127 --> 18:10.130
Um, if-- if it starts to feel like
a washing machine,

18:10.214 --> 18:11.507
then you've gone too far.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.258
We did have a washing machine.

18:16.303 --> 18:17.888
Okay. Opening line one.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.390
-Cat?
-Yeah.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.645
Opening line two.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.272
-Still cat?

18:27.356 --> 18:28.232
I think so.

18:29.483 --> 18:32.111
Okay, both lines open.
Flushing the fuel tank now.

18:45.374 --> 18:48.210
You pushed it too far.
All the pressure bled off.

18:49.336 --> 18:51.171
So much easier if I could do this myself.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.799
-I'll try again.
-There's no more fuel left in the lines.

18:53.882 --> 18:56.301
I-- Sorry. I just--

18:56.385 --> 18:59.471
It's making me crazy
being stuck in this chair.

19:04.893 --> 19:07.271
"Oh, the places you'll go."

19:09.940 --> 19:11.775
"You'll be on your way up."

19:13.026 --> 19:14.987
"You'll be seeing great sights."

19:15.070 --> 19:19.783
"And you'll join the high fliers
who soar to the high heights."

19:44.016 --> 19:47.186
"You won't lag behind
because you'll have the speed."

19:49.354 --> 19:52.524
"You'll pass the whole gang,
and soon you'll take the lead."

20:01.909 --> 20:02.910
Go check it out.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.966
Looks like
we're about halfway swallowed.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.302
So the rear airlock's still clear?

20:20.886 --> 20:21.845
For now.

20:21.929 --> 20:22.888
Good.

20:24.181 --> 20:26.266
I'm not abandoning you here
to be digested.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.810
There has to be a way
to get the ship out of here.

20:30.771 --> 20:34.399
I'm just saying that…
I might not be able to go.

20:40.530 --> 20:41.406
Judy?

20:45.369 --> 20:48.455
Whatever it is you're planning,
it's very impressive.

20:48.538 --> 20:50.082
-I mean, it involves a skull.

20:50.165 --> 20:53.085
But what if something goes wrong?

20:53.168 --> 20:55.170
Then Robot will protect me.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.506
What if something happens to him?

20:58.298 --> 21:02.594
We can't leave this place
or reach Alpha Centauri without him.

21:02.678 --> 21:03.595
I know that.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.390
Look, I'm not saying
don't have your showdown with SAR.

21:06.473 --> 21:09.476
I'm just saying that
if you really wanna help your parents,

21:09.559 --> 21:11.895
then take care of them first.

21:12.813 --> 21:16.108
Besides, don't you wanna see
what it's like on Alpha Centauri?

21:19.403 --> 21:21.363
What do you think
is waiting for you on the colony?

21:21.446 --> 21:25.200
Do you really think all your problems
are just gonna… go away?

21:25.284 --> 21:26.952
You know what my problem is?

21:28.870 --> 21:29.746
People.

21:31.498 --> 21:33.166
They don't bring out the best in me.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.044
On Alpha Centauri,

21:37.212 --> 21:40.007
I imagine there's a place
far away from everyone

21:40.090 --> 21:44.303
with a magnificent view
you could see for miles.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.306
Your parents deserve that too.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.227
Even your sisters, more or less.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.148
But nobody more than you.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.910
Do you need to take a break?

22:09.828 --> 22:13.498
Just when I've achieved total numbness
in my arms? Not on your life.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.298
Danger.

22:27.637 --> 22:29.473
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>Emergency power.</i>

22:29.556 --> 22:30.390
Fudge!

22:33.018 --> 22:35.395
-Damn it!

22:37.981 --> 22:40.108
Tell me when it's off.

22:41.276 --> 22:42.652
-It's still going.
-Now?

22:42.736 --> 22:43.737
-No.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.245
-Now?
-Not yet.

22:52.954 --> 22:54.956
How about now?

22:57.459 --> 22:59.336
-What the…

23:01.922 --> 23:03.173
That's it. They're all off.

23:04.674 --> 23:09.221
I, um… I just saw a really weird recording
on the monitor, like an old recording.

23:09.721 --> 23:10.931
Yeah?

23:11.890 --> 23:16.603
Got the hard drive.
We'll watch it later. Come on.

23:16.686 --> 23:18.563
How long do we have before they get here?

23:18.647 --> 23:21.566
Given their probable initial
search pattern and rate of movement,

23:21.650 --> 23:23.735
I'd say 10 to 15 minutes.

23:23.819 --> 23:27.572
Really? I thought Mom was the only one
who did complicated math in her head.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.991
It's the kind of math
I used to do for a living.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.836
I think I found the solution.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.547
There's a high percentage
of hydroquinone in the saliva.

23:43.630 --> 23:44.589
Tell me more.

23:44.673 --> 23:47.551
I think this thing is like a snake.
It swallows its prey whole.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.177
In this case, the Jupiter.

23:51.138 --> 23:54.433
Okay, in one of my premed electives,
I studied the bombardier beetle.

23:54.516 --> 23:57.894
If swallowed by a snake, it would release
chemical compounds from its legs,

23:57.978 --> 24:00.188
creating a reaction
inside the predator's belly.

24:00.272 --> 24:04.693
If one of the compounds is, I'm guessing,
hydroquinone, then what's the other one?

24:04.776 --> 24:08.572
Simple hydrogen peroxide.
And I have liters of it in the med bay.

24:08.655 --> 24:10.782
When mixed together, it induces vomiting.

24:10.866 --> 24:13.160
In a snake, on Earth.

24:13.243 --> 24:16.746
-We're inside God only knows what.
-Well, isn't everything made of stardust?

24:18.165 --> 24:19.958
I'm gonna go get the supplies.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.171
-Did you find it yet?
-Almost.

24:28.091 --> 24:30.552
Penny says you wanna be a doctor
when you grow up.

24:31.511 --> 24:34.973
Penny doesn't know
what she's talking about. She's six.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.641
Hmm.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.686
Medicine's a noble profession.

24:42.397 --> 24:43.315
Found it.

24:43.940 --> 24:46.193
-How many moons can you see?
-Io…

24:47.360 --> 24:50.697
Europa, Ganymede, and…

24:58.788 --> 24:59.998
You know it.

25:04.628 --> 25:05.462
Callisto.

25:05.545 --> 25:06.630
Perfect!

25:10.008 --> 25:12.344
You know, you can be a doctor in space.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.888
If that's what you want.

25:16.181 --> 25:20.060
Because you are Judy Robinson,
and you can do anything. 

25:22.020 --> 25:25.190
You're Judy Robinson.
You can do this. You can do anything.

26:02.852 --> 26:05.397
I have something really important
that I have to ask you about.

26:06.523 --> 26:07.607
Okay.

26:09.150 --> 26:11.945
It's about Vijay and Liam.

26:12.737 --> 26:14.489
-Who?
-Dad? Really?

26:15.282 --> 26:17.617
Vijay? Victor's son.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.287
Oh, yeah, right. And Liam?

26:20.829 --> 26:24.833
You don't know him, but we were
all shipwrecked together for a year…

26:24.916 --> 26:26.126
You wanna do this now?

26:26.209 --> 26:28.837
Dad, this is important to me.

26:31.256 --> 26:32.507
All right. I'm listening.

26:34.926 --> 26:38.513
So, I'm kind of torn between the two,

26:39.222 --> 26:41.683
and I'm trying to figure out
which one is right for me.

26:44.686 --> 26:47.188
Right for what? To be your boyfriend?

26:48.982 --> 26:51.943
I mean, no one uses that term anymore.
But basically, yeah.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.240
You know, Vijay…

26:58.783 --> 27:01.453
…just has the biggest heart.

27:02.037 --> 27:04.372
You know, he cares about everyone.

27:06.166 --> 27:10.170
Well, you know,
that, uh, quality's hard to find.

27:10.253 --> 27:16.718
Yeah, but then again, Liam,
there's something really strong about him.

27:16.801 --> 27:21.097
You know, like-- like he could catch me
if I fell off a cliff. Actually, he did.

27:22.724 --> 27:23.767
Well, yeah,

27:24.768 --> 27:28.271
that, uh…
that kind of trust is hard to find.

27:28.355 --> 27:29.314
So, uh…

27:31.024 --> 27:32.233
maybe he's your guy.

27:32.817 --> 27:33.693
Yeah.

27:42.911 --> 27:44.079
I know what you're doing.

27:44.871 --> 27:45.830
What do you mean?

27:46.539 --> 27:50.168
You're playing Go Fish
while our spaceship crashes.

27:51.252 --> 27:54.673
You're keeping my mind occupied
like I used to do when you were scared.

27:56.591 --> 27:57.717
Like I am now.

27:59.052 --> 28:02.472
Well, when I'm with you, I'm never scared.

28:14.275 --> 28:18.196
I estimate we've used 9 to 14
of our 10 to 15 minutes.

28:18.863 --> 28:21.324
We better get moving. Now.

28:34.838 --> 28:37.716
So how fast
will that make this thing throw us up?

28:37.799 --> 28:40.260
Pretty fast. If I could just…

28:44.431 --> 28:45.390
Everything okay?

28:45.473 --> 28:46.516
It's nothing.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.186
Yeah, the skin
is just really tough.

28:54.315 --> 28:56.025
Did you hurt yourself in the crash?

28:56.109 --> 28:57.527
Yeah, I fractured my shoulder.

28:58.319 --> 29:00.113
-Judy!

29:00.196 --> 29:01.489
Why didn't you tell me?

29:01.573 --> 29:02.907
Because I'm handling it.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.493
Since when do you keep things from me?

29:05.577 --> 29:09.372
All the time, since I'm the daughter
that you don't have to worry about.

29:09.456 --> 29:12.751
-Well, I-- I worry about you!
-Why would you?

29:13.418 --> 29:16.379
I'm the one you'd wanna be stuck with…
in an emergency.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.799
I'm the… perfect child!

29:23.428 --> 29:26.181
I-- I never expected you to be perfect.

29:26.723 --> 29:28.183
Really? You didn't?

29:29.851 --> 29:33.772
Well, I… I wanted you
to live up to your potential.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.524
Well, I was just trying to live up to you.

29:37.817 --> 29:38.735
Judy.

29:39.903 --> 29:42.614
You know why I didn't know
why it was so hard for me?

29:43.656 --> 29:47.619
Because I was trying to live up to a dream
that I didn't understand.

29:51.915 --> 29:57.170
You wanted to be an astronaut,
Mom, and I… I took that from you.

30:04.761 --> 30:05.970
I didn't realize.

30:07.305 --> 30:08.348
I know.

30:15.939 --> 30:19.192
You have to get out of here.
Go out the back airlock now.

30:19.275 --> 30:22.862
No, we're doing this together.
You didn't leave me. I'm not leaving you.

30:23.446 --> 30:24.989
We're doing this together.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.285
It's too small.

30:42.048 --> 30:44.050
This box kept Penny and Smith alive
in space.

30:44.133 --> 30:46.761
-It should protect us from the shrapnel.
-Right.

30:47.345 --> 30:49.556
We need something
to make this thing throw us up,

30:49.639 --> 30:51.891
so this chair's thrust
should do the trick.

31:03.987 --> 31:04.988
Are you sure?

31:05.071 --> 31:08.157
I'm the daughter of Maureen Robinson.
I'm sure. On three.

31:10.118 --> 31:12.662
One, two, three.

31:49.032 --> 31:51.117
You know, this is how it all began.

31:52.535 --> 31:53.661
Just you and me.

32:08.009 --> 32:08.927
Hmm.

32:13.514 --> 32:16.768
I never checked on the fuel tanks.
I should probably do that.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.566
Why don't you rest for a minute?

32:24.442 --> 32:26.945
I'm gonna get you a sling
from the med bay.

32:28.780 --> 32:29.781
Thanks, Mom.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.630
Ugh! Will, let's go.

32:48.132 --> 32:50.093
Come on! Forget about the skull.

32:50.176 --> 32:51.177
I'm almost there.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.848
Did you hear that? Something's coming.

33:05.483 --> 33:07.735
Will, hurry!
We gotta get out of here!

33:08.695 --> 33:10.279
I got it.

33:10.363 --> 33:12.281
No!

33:18.579 --> 33:19.497
Robot!

33:21.541 --> 33:22.625
Yeah!

33:24.544 --> 33:28.798
Ah! I guess I'm not the only one
who likes to make a dramatic entrance.

33:28.881 --> 33:29.757
Hey, Will!

33:30.758 --> 33:32.760
-Hey.
-You need a hand getting down?

33:32.844 --> 33:34.178
No, I think I'm okay.

33:36.806 --> 33:37.682
Thanks.

33:38.933 --> 33:39.767
Hey.

33:40.685 --> 33:41.644
Did you get hurt?

33:41.728 --> 33:44.105
Oh, actually,
he needed a little bit of surgery.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.024
It was pretty medieval. Lots of sawing.

33:46.107 --> 33:48.901
Are we really gonna stand here
catching up with each other?

33:48.985 --> 33:50.778
What about SAR and his friends?

33:50.862 --> 33:52.572
We managed to lose him for now.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.700
Let's go find
the rest of the family.

34:08.171 --> 34:10.465
-Will. Come on.
-Coming, Dad.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.092
Yeah. Hey.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.189
I guess you scared him away.

34:29.317 --> 34:32.445
-Let's get out of here.

34:32.528 --> 34:34.322
This time, I'm carrying you.
