03:44.100 --> 03:45.320
Well,I think he does.

03:45.330 --> 03:49.020
If he knew,you would be transferred.

03:50.380 --> 03:53.630
The idea of somebody making a call whether

05:54.040 --> 05:56.750
Towers lost contact three hours in.

05:56.760 --> 05:59.200
They thought it might have
been electrical interference.

05:59.210 --> 06:02.310
They entered our airspace radio silent.

06:02.320 --> 06:06.030
Navy then scrambles
two f-18s for escort.

06:06.050 --> 06:08.260

06:08.290 --> 06:10.920
No signs of life aboard the jet.

06:10.940 --> 06:16.090
White house approved a cdc request for
the jet not to be opened until they arrive.

No signs of life? Who
was flying the plane?

- And not just this fax--
- we're on that too liaison.

10:00.800 --> 10:04.430
We don't think what happened on that
plane was a result of the in-flight movie.

10:04.440 --> 10:09.980
Back bay pd got a call at 0300 from
a guard on duty at a storage facility.

10:10.010 --> 10:15.420

eastern men" handing a white guy a briefcase.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.560
in conjunction with the
center for disease control,

10:29.580 --> 10:34.130

10:57.620 --> 10:59.770
You said you loved me.

10:59.780 --> 11:02.270

11:02.750 --> 11:05.400

11:06.400 --> 11:08.210
That was a big deal.

11:08.220 --> 11:12.220

anything back,so I just let it go.

12:12.590 --> 12:15.570

transport team out here now.

12:40.370 --> 12:42.350

13:26.400 --> 13:28.300

- John!

14:20.500 --> 14:21.930
John.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.790
you were very lucky today,agent dunham.

14:41.900 --> 14:45.480
Your wounds could've easily
been much more severe.

14:46.850 --> 14:49.500
Agent scott wasn't as fortunate.

14:49.510 --> 14:55.570
While he survived the initial blast,agent scott
was exposed to some synthetic chemical compounds.

14:55.580 --> 14:58.450
Work that was done
in the labs you found.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.590
He's not contagious,but
until we understand more,

15:05.610 --> 15:10.150
it's better not to introduce
any additional contaminants.

15:13.110 --> 15:16.990
We haven't been able to identify
the substance that's affecting him.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.950
The cdc has sent in specialists,but...

15:19.960 --> 15:22.610
well,they've never seen anything
like what's happening here.

15:22.620 --> 15:25.430
We've put agent scott
in a drug-induced coma.

15:25.440 --> 15:30.220
His body temperature has been lowered
significantly to try and slow the progress.

15:42.060 --> 15:44.350
I'm sorry,agent dunham.

16:38.710 --> 16:41.070
It's me.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.740
Liaison.

16:48.570 --> 16:52.780
I found a connection between the hamburg
flight and what's happened to agent scott.

16:58.940 --> 17:00.900
His name's walter bishop.

17:00.910 --> 17:02.720
He's a scientific
researcher from cambridge.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.970
Born in '46,harvard educated.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.819
Post grad at oxford and M.I.T.

17:06.829 --> 17:09.180
Look at the experiments
he was doing in the '70s.

17:09.190 --> 17:11.839
I believe dr. Bishop might have
information that might tell us

17:11.859 --> 17:15.240
what happened aboard that plane
and save agent scott's life.

17:15.250 --> 17:18.560
Says the guy's been at
st. Claire's for 17 years.

17:18.569 --> 17:21.550
I saw that. An assistant
was killed in his lab.

17:21.560 --> 17:24.560
Rumors about dr. Bishop
using humans as guinea pigs.

17:24.569 --> 17:27.819
He was charged with manslaughter,but
was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.430
Why are you so sure
bishop's worth our time?

17:29.440 --> 17:30.600
Why are you so sure he's not?

17:30.610 --> 17:33.340
Listen,dunham,you and i
got off on the wrong foot--

17:33.350 --> 17:36.980
if my past job performance as U.S.
Marine special investigator offends you--

17:36.990 --> 17:40.830
well,yeah,it does.

17:40.850 --> 17:45.100
A man who serves his country for 30 years
has a few drinks and a small lapse in judgment

17:45.110 --> 17:46.780
- does not deserve five years.
- A small lapse in judgment that

17:46.790 --> 17:49.020
will haunt three young women
for the rest of their lives.

17:49.030 --> 17:52.280
But that's not tonight's business,is it?

17:52.290 --> 17:57.590
Look,D.C.Has tasked me to make sure that our
reaction to flight 627 is beyond reproach.

17:57.600 --> 18:02.150
Now it says here,in 1991 the
glorious state of massachusetts

18:02.160 --> 18:07.400
forbade dr. Bishop from having any visitors
with the exception of immediate family.

18:07.420 --> 18:13.060
So from where I sit,barging into a
mental institution waving the patriot act,

18:13.070 --> 18:14.110
which is what you'd need,

18:14.120 --> 18:16.640
and demanding face time
with some old lab rat

18:16.660 --> 18:21.460
who you think might be behind some of the most
terrifying terror that I can possibly imagine--

18:21.480 --> 18:23.090
I'm coming to you with a solid lead,

18:23.100 --> 18:25.880
- And your personal resentment is preventing
you-- - and you're wasting your breath and my time.

18:25.890 --> 18:28.860
Do you understand "immediate family?"

18:28.870 --> 18:33.140
You want to question dr. Bishop,you go find
his next of kin and have 'em escort you in.

18:33.160 --> 18:37.930
Talk to bishop,uncover something
substantial,and I will have your back.

18:37.940 --> 18:42.200
Until then,I am not so convinced.

18:42.210 --> 18:44.830
Now can you handle that?

18:47.390 --> 18:50.060
He does have a son.

18:50.670 --> 18:53.370
Is his son local too?

18:53.700 --> 18:55.720
Not exactly.

19:00.150 --> 19:04.110
<i>{\a6}BAGHADAD IRAQ</i>

19:04.120 --> 19:05.920
so this guy's walter bishop's son.

19:05.930 --> 19:07.270
his name's peter bishop.

19:07.280 --> 19:11.750
He's a high school dropout,I.Q.At
190,which is 50 points north of genius.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.410
Misfit,nomad.

19:13.440 --> 19:15.600
Hasn't kept a job
longer than two months.

19:15.610 --> 19:18.920
He's been a wild land
fireman,cargo pilot,

19:18.930 --> 19:22.030
and briefly a college
chemistry professor.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.180
He falsified a degree from M.I.T.

19:24.200 --> 19:27.810
And even managed to get a few papers
published before he was found out.

19:27.820 --> 19:31.190
Sounds like a massive pain in the ass.

19:33.110 --> 19:34.640
my resume is hardly traditional.

19:34.670 --> 19:38.130
But around these parts,traditional
increasingly means irrelevant.

19:38.150 --> 19:41.550
$100 billion sunk into infrastructure
and you can barely keep the lights on.

19:41.570 --> 19:45.300
So you need someone to oversee construction
on 600 miles of pipeline to carry crude

19:45.310 --> 19:47.330
between your fields in
kirkuk and the port of ceyhan.

19:47.340 --> 19:52.440
A job well outside the green zone,I
might add while I'm still alive to do so.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.950
You'll need someone who has a handle
on the laws of hydrodynamic resistance.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.790
The heat exchange in oil mixture flows.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.910
You'll also need someone who can
work with mixed integer programs

20:02.920 --> 20:06.220
because you're gonna have to resize the pipes
as you start working across uneven terrain.

20:06.230 --> 20:10.970
That is,if you want to keep
down construction costs.

20:16.810 --> 20:19.520
I also speak farsi.

20:19.530 --> 20:24.930
And 600,000 all in sounds fair.

20:30.070 --> 20:31.280
Peter bishop.

20:31.290 --> 20:34.250
Olivia dunham. I'm with the fbi.

20:35.350 --> 20:35.990
Okay.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.780
You've heard of flight 627?

20:39.130 --> 20:40.400
The hamburg flight,of course.

20:40.410 --> 20:42.500
You may be able to help us with that.

20:42.510 --> 20:43.840
No,I think you got the wrong guy.

20:43.850 --> 20:46.680
Your father is walter bishop.

20:48.590 --> 20:50.850
You know,the last time somebody
asked me that it was an accusation.

20:50.860 --> 20:53.960
Well,he's the man we're looking to
speak with,but due to his current status,

20:53.970 --> 20:55.770
you're the only one who
can provide us access.

20:55.780 --> 20:57.980
And what possible help
could that man be to you?

20:57.990 --> 21:00.370
And what is it exactly that
you're expecting me to do?

21:00.380 --> 21:02.690
Hop on a plane with you
back to massachusetts?

21:02.700 --> 21:04.080
I just got here,honey.

21:04.090 --> 21:06.340
I can have you on a return flight
here in four days,but first--

21:06.350 --> 21:07.660
let me save you the time.

21:07.670 --> 21:09.640
I'd rather stay here in iraq.

21:09.650 --> 21:11.800
That's how much I want to see my father.

21:11.810 --> 21:15.110
I'm going to beg you as
one human being to another.

21:15.120 --> 21:18.790
Your father may be able to
save someone who's dying.

21:18.800 --> 21:22.310
Someone I care about very much.

21:27.420 --> 21:30.560
Sweetheart,we all care
about someone who's dying.

21:30.570 --> 21:32.900
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

21:33.820 --> 21:36.260
I know why you're here!

21:40.010 --> 21:42.720
I have your file.

21:43.810 --> 21:44.890
What file?

21:44.900 --> 21:48.230
The one the fbi would say doesn't exist.

21:49.830 --> 21:51.450
And it has everything.

21:51.460 --> 21:54.920
Where you've been,what
you're running from.

21:55.660 --> 21:58.360
And what you need while you're here.

21:58.370 --> 22:04.340
So either you come with me,or I let
certain people know your whereabouts.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.760
When do we leave?

22:16.480 --> 22:19.100
did the doctors say anything else?

22:19.110 --> 22:20.920
Yeah.

22:21.630 --> 22:24.110
Thanks,charlie.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.330
Let me ask you something.

22:29.850 --> 22:33.290
My father,not my favorite.

22:33.300 --> 22:36.440
He is without a doubt the
most self-absorbed,twisted,

22:36.450 --> 22:41.170
abusive,brilliant,myopic
son of a bitch on the planet.

22:41.180 --> 22:43.600
So he was a chemist.

22:43.610 --> 22:46.490
That much I already know.

22:46.500 --> 22:50.920
He worked out of a basement lab in harvard
doing research for a toothpaste company.

22:50.930 --> 22:53.400
I also know that there was an
accident at the lab one night,

22:53.410 --> 22:57.970
that my father was arrested,beginning the
first truly peaceful period in our home.

22:57.990 --> 23:01.060
But here's the thing,olivia.

23:01.070 --> 23:06.900
My gut tells me that your friend's
life,the one hanging in the balance,

23:07.220 --> 23:10.960
not gonna be saved by
a tube of toothpaste.

23:17.750 --> 23:21.520
He worked out of harvard,but
not on toothpaste.

23:21.530 --> 23:26.460
He was part of a classified U.S.Army
experimental program called kelvin genetics.

23:26.470 --> 23:30.400
They gave him the resources
to do whatever work he wanted,

23:30.410 --> 23:35.110
which was primarily in an
area called fringe science.

23:36.740 --> 23:40.310
When you say fringe
science,you mean pseudoscience.

23:40.320 --> 23:41.260
I suppose.

23:41.280 --> 23:46.410
Things like mind
control,teleportation,astral projection,

23:46.420 --> 23:49.420
invisibility,genetic
mutation,reanimation,fertility--

23:49.430 --> 23:51.560
whoa,excuse for a sec.

23:51.570 --> 23:54.260
Reanimation? Really?

23:54.270 --> 23:57.240
So you're telling me what?

23:57.250 --> 24:00.190
My father was dr. Frankenstein?

24:13.250 --> 24:18.490
<i>{\a6}ESSEXCOUNTY MASSACHUSETTS</i>

24:44.590 --> 24:46.520
You know what?

24:46.910 --> 24:49.430
Why don't you go on ahead.

25:07.440 --> 25:11.250
Dr. Bishop,special
day. You have a visitor.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.030
Hello.

25:27.780 --> 25:31.950
I knew someone would come... eventually.

25:37.950 --> 25:40.330
Dr. Bishop.

25:41.660 --> 25:44.450
Dr. Bishop?

25:47.630 --> 25:51.000
And you said this was--
when did this happen?

25:51.010 --> 25:53.830
The incident on the plane
happened four days ago.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.030
Agent scott was injured the next day.

25:55.040 --> 25:59.220
The dermis already
indurated,translucent.

25:59.230 --> 26:00.740
M-muscular tissue visible.

26:00.750 --> 26:03.060
On scott,you mean,can
you see through skin?

26:03.070 --> 26:04.010
Yes.

26:04.020 --> 26:05.060
Oh,that's not good.

26:05.080 --> 26:08.960
To see through the skin,it's--it's
tricky,it's advanced.

26:08.970 --> 26:11.350
- Like that it's tricky.
- What's happening to him?

26:11.360 --> 26:13.990
Can it be reversed?

26:18.910 --> 26:20.910
What is it?

26:22.590 --> 26:26.790
They... they have this horrible...

26:27.350 --> 26:29.760
pudding here.

26:29.770 --> 26:33.900
Butterscotch pudding on
mondays. It's dreadful.

26:37.530 --> 26:40.170
It's thursday.

26:40.180 --> 26:45.080
Oh,that's fantastic news.

26:51.300 --> 26:54.240
It can be reversed.

26:54.250 --> 26:57.010
What happened to your colleague.

26:57.020 --> 27:01.500
Years ago I worked with
lab animals,and--and ...

27:01.510 --> 27:05.910
some of them were
afflicted,but were saved.

27:06.120 --> 27:09.950
So do you remember what to do?

27:24.210 --> 27:30.470
This place,their- their
choice of therapies has c--c--

27:33.770 --> 27:36.510
Dr. Bishop.

27:39.360 --> 27:42.990
You came here today with my son.

27:45.220 --> 27:49.660
I'm not allowed visitors,you
see,except immediate family.

27:49.670 --> 27:56.240
And unless the order has been
lifted,then it's a simple if/then formula.

27:56.250 --> 27:59.870
If you are here,then so is he.

28:01.870 --> 28:06.000
I would... so much...

28:06.010 --> 28:09.840
so very much like to see him.

28:10.540 --> 28:12.900
So much.

28:21.640 --> 28:24.500
He asked for you.

28:25.650 --> 28:27.260
Thanks,sweetheart.

28:27.270 --> 28:28.470
I really appreciate that.

28:28.480 --> 28:30.690
Hey,I didn't tell him you were here.

28:30.700 --> 28:34.370
And call me "sweetheart" one
more time. I'd really like that.

29:02.760 --> 29:05.800
Hello,walter.

29:09.790 --> 29:12.650
I thought you'd be fatter.

29:12.660 --> 29:15.630
You thought I would be fatter.

29:15.640 --> 29:17.730
Excellent first words,perfect.

29:17.740 --> 29:20.410
No,as a boy,you were rounder.

29:20.420 --> 29:22.920
Yes,I was until the
summer before high school.

29:22.930 --> 29:24.530
Not that I'd expect
you to remember that.

29:24.540 --> 29:25.600
May I see something?

29:25.620 --> 29:27.700
What are you doing? Take
your hands off of me!

29:27.710 --> 29:31.670
Pupils are good. They're
good. Thank goodness.

29:31.680 --> 29:34.860
How advanced is your
colleague's condition?

29:34.870 --> 29:39.490
Which--which is
something I-I-I--

29:39.500 --> 29:44.060
I'm unable to deduce without
a firsthand examination.

29:44.070 --> 29:46.840
I must see mr. Scott myself.

29:46.850 --> 29:50.570
Which I am unable to do.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.890
Well,under present law.

29:52.900 --> 29:59.530
Unless--unless signed out by a legal
guardian who must be,once again,a relative.

29:59.540 --> 30:02.010
What are you
asking me to--

30:02.020 --> 30:04.060
no.Guardian? No,forget it.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.840
- He'll do it.
- No,I will not.

30:05.850 --> 30:08.160
One phone call. That's all it
takes. You want me to make it?

30:08.170 --> 30:11.370
'Cause I got my phone in my pocket.

30:12.020 --> 30:15.380
Now it's out of my pocket.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.520
You wanted my father.

30:21.530 --> 30:24.180
Now you've got my father.

30:24.190 --> 30:27.760
Which falls into the category of
be careful what you wish for...

30:27.770 --> 30:30.250
sweetheart.

31:25.430 --> 31:29.530
every effort is being made to
understand what happened on flight 627...

31:29.540 --> 31:31.990
dr. Bishop,I was curious.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.340
Did anyone else ever
have access to your work?

31:34.360 --> 31:39.960
Well,the assistants had bits and pieces.

31:40.930 --> 31:43.780
And god,I suppose.

31:44.420 --> 31:48.290
I supposed the only one that really
knew what I was doing was belly.

31:48.310 --> 31:49.000
Who?

31:49.010 --> 31:51.460
Belly,william bell. He
and I shared the lab.

31:51.470 --> 31:52.070
William bell?

31:52.080 --> 31:55.100
You shared your lab with the
founder of massive dynamics?

31:55.110 --> 31:57.940
I'm sorry,I don't know what
that is,massive dynamics.

31:57.950 --> 32:00.210
Oh,nothing really. Just
a tiny little company.

32:00.220 --> 32:01.620
That's perfect.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.950
One guys becomes one of the
wealthiest men on the planet.

32:03.960 --> 32:07.260
The other guy becomes an
institutionalized psychopath.

32:07.270 --> 32:09.590
What? What happened?

32:09.600 --> 32:11.960
I just pissed myself.

32:11.980 --> 32:14.790
- Excellent.
- Just a squirt.

32:18.880 --> 32:25.190
<i>{\a6}MASSIVE DYNAMICM</i>

32:30.760 --> 32:32.480
I just got your message. How's john?

32:32.490 --> 32:33.510
Worse.

32:33.520 --> 32:36.850
Cdc says the hamburg flight was
caused by a synthetic compound.

32:36.870 --> 32:40.090
Which is like saying rain
is caused by a wet compound.

32:40.100 --> 32:43.070
They've run some tests on john,but
haven't come back with anything.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.040
What about bishop?

32:44.050 --> 32:47.320
Left to right,insane and irritating.

32:47.340 --> 32:50.040
And also my only hope.

32:50.230 --> 32:51.910
Listen...

32:51.920 --> 32:54.310
I need to question william bell.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.840
Could you set that up for me?

32:55.850 --> 32:57.510
William bell?

32:57.520 --> 32:59.110
Massive dynamics william bell.

32:59.120 --> 33:02.680
He and bishop used to share a lab.

33:02.690 --> 33:05.160
You're kidding.

33:48.350 --> 33:50.630
Dr. Bishop?

34:09.199 --> 34:11.929
Is there ginger ale? Any ginger ale?

34:12.679 --> 34:17.500
I haven't had some in
a long time. I miss it.

34:20.100 --> 34:23.980
Can we please get some ginger ale
for the doctor,agent farnsworth.

34:23.989 --> 34:26.310
Sure.

34:26.320 --> 34:28.710
Whoa,stop right now! Stop!

34:28.719 --> 34:31.800
Does this not concern you?

34:36.230 --> 34:38.540
Let him go.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.810
Petri dish.

34:50.820 --> 34:53.679
Quick,please.

35:04.890 --> 35:06.580
Good.

35:06.590 --> 35:09.740
- I need to take this to my lab right away.
- Your what?

35:09.750 --> 35:12.520
Kresge building basement,harvard.

35:12.530 --> 35:13.690
We should leave.

35:13.700 --> 35:14.720
I have my sample.

35:14.730 --> 35:18.650
Your lab was shutdown after you left.

35:19.930 --> 35:21.560
I'm sorry?

35:21.570 --> 35:24.210
Wake up. It's gone.

35:25.210 --> 35:26.870
No.

35:26.880 --> 35:29.040
No,no,no.

35:29.050 --> 35:31.270
No,no,no,no,no,no.

35:31.280 --> 35:32.780
Walter,there is no lab.

35:32.790 --> 35:34.790
- It's a perfect
working-- - no!

35:34.800 --> 35:37.460
Damn you,damn you!

35:37.490 --> 35:40.870
We need to get him back immediately.

35:46.260 --> 35:47.810
Liaison.

35:47.820 --> 35:49.730
- When did you get back?
- I need your help.

35:49.740 --> 35:53.990
I want you to know I've successfully had
dr. Walter bishop released from st.Claire's,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.880
and he requires the use
of his old laboratory.

35:56.890 --> 35:57.760
I'm sorry,what?

35:57.770 --> 36:01.290
Kresge building. Harvard,basement.

36:01.300 --> 36:05.380
The university's been using it
for storage for the past 17 years.

36:05.390 --> 36:08.960
It would be nice to think
that your tenacity in this case

36:08.970 --> 36:13.350
is a byproduct of a remarkable
and robust professionalism.

36:14.420 --> 36:16.990
But I can't help but wonder

36:17.000 --> 36:21.620
if there wasn't something going
on between you and agent scott.

36:22.150 --> 36:24.990
Get the lab for bishop.

36:46.960 --> 36:49.180
So much.

36:49.190 --> 36:52.050
So much happened here.

36:54.600 --> 36:57.290
And so much is about to.

37:05.160 --> 37:09.210
<i>{\a6}HARVARD UNIVERSITY</i>

37:11.110 --> 37:14.250
Dr. Bishop,I've ordered a
standard forensics work package.

37:14.260 --> 37:16.420
Is there anything else you need?

37:16.440 --> 37:19.740
Um,optical coherence
tomograph for flesh study.

37:19.750 --> 37:22.050
2,000 pounds of silicon.

37:22.060 --> 37:26.850
At least five anonymous blood
samples from volunteer donors.

37:26.860 --> 37:28.870
Microorganism detector.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.220
Nasa grade,of course.
There's still nasa,yes?

37:31.230 --> 37:32.230
Yes.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.840
Oh,she's still here!

37:34.850 --> 37:37.000
Oh,this tank was the best.

37:37.010 --> 37:39.170
And a two-year-old
bos taurus.

37:39.180 --> 37:40.420
A what?

37:40.430 --> 37:42.320
A cow.

37:42.330 --> 37:43.570
He wants a cow.

37:43.580 --> 37:46.350
Purebred,not crossbred.
This is important.

37:46.360 --> 37:49.360
Mature weight,850 pounds.

37:49.370 --> 37:53.040
Internal fat average of 2.37

37:53.050 --> 37:54.140
Is he joking?

37:54.150 --> 37:58.330
Genetically,humans and cows are
separated by only a couple lines of dna.

37:58.340 --> 38:00.180
So it's an ethical test subject.

38:00.190 --> 38:02.040
Where'd you learn that? M.I.T?

38:02.050 --> 38:03.470
No,actually.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.460
I picked that up reading books.

38:05.470 --> 38:07.960
You should try it sometime. It's fun.

38:12.820 --> 38:14.270
Get him the cow.

38:14.280 --> 38:16.270
Fantastic,thank you.

38:16.280 --> 38:18.840
The only thing better
than a cow is a human.

38:18.850 --> 38:22.290
Unless you need milk.
Then you really need a cow.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.880
Coffee?

39:10.890 --> 39:12.600
Thanks.

39:12.610 --> 39:14.440
Tell me.

39:14.450 --> 39:18.570
What else did that file say
about yours truly? How bad was it?

39:18.580 --> 39:21.830
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

39:22.550 --> 39:25.180
Why don't you go ahead and liberate
yourself,'cause I'm here now,

39:25.190 --> 39:29.070
so I kind of feel like I
deserve the truth,don't you?

39:35.900 --> 39:37.590
There was no file.

39:37.600 --> 39:38.660
I needed you back here.

39:38.670 --> 39:40.200
So that was what? You were bluffing?

39:40.210 --> 39:41.340
I-I was desperate.

39:41.350 --> 39:43.240
You know,I'm usually pretty
good at reading people.

39:43.250 --> 39:44.480
That's sort of what I do.

39:44.490 --> 39:47.030
Yeah,well,I could see you were
in trouble. Anyone could see that.

39:47.040 --> 39:49.800
So I could've stayed.

39:50.440 --> 39:51.910
I could've stayed in iraq.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.900
You know,a car bomb went
off this morning in kirkuk.

39:54.910 --> 39:57.410
You might just owe me a thank you.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.540
Yeah,well,I owe a lot.

39:59.550 --> 40:03.470
Tsk,yeah,I figured. MafiA.

40:03.750 --> 40:05.650
A guy named big eddie.

40:05.660 --> 40:07.540
You owe money to a guy
nicknamed big eddie?

40:07.550 --> 40:09.620
No,I owe money to a guy named big eddie.

40:09.630 --> 40:11.540
He had it legally changed.

40:11.550 --> 40:13.860
And the thing is,I'm not even
a gambler. I mean,I never was.

40:13.870 --> 40:19.790
It just-- a couple years
ago I went a bit crazy.

40:19.800 --> 40:22.000
I thought you were a genius.
You must've had a system.

40:22.010 --> 40:23.830
Of course there was a system.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.300
The house was cheating.

40:25.310 --> 40:27.510
But you try telling 'em that.

40:31.850 --> 40:34.140
'72 during vietnam.

40:34.150 --> 40:39.130
The D.O.D.'S biochem division had
us working on a leprotic contagion

40:39.140 --> 40:41.760
for possible use against the vietcong.

40:41.770 --> 40:48.170
It's possible that whatever affected that
plane may have been derived from that work.

40:48.180 --> 40:49.250
What about john?

40:49.260 --> 40:54.580
What's infecting him is merely a chemical
reaction to the raw laboratory ingredients,

40:54.600 --> 40:56.260
not the finished contagion.

40:56.270 --> 40:58.330
Which means we can
synthesize a counteragent.

40:58.340 --> 40:59.890
- So you can help him.
- don't do that.

40:59.900 --> 41:01.250
Don't give her false hope.

41:01.260 --> 41:03.640
There's no false. It's
not false. It's real.

41:03.650 --> 41:05.560
I could help, yes.

41:05.570 --> 41:09.730
If I had a precise inventory of what was
in that storage facility when it detonated.

41:09.740 --> 41:11.040
We don't have it.

41:11.060 --> 41:12.500
It all went up, everything.

41:12.510 --> 41:14.550
And the suspect who might
have those answers got away,

41:14.560 --> 41:16.890
and john was the only
one who saw his face.

41:16.900 --> 41:20.060
So how long does he have left?

41:20.070 --> 41:23.410
Current rate of crystallization,
cellular degradation--

41:23.440 --> 41:26.420
- how long?
- 24 hours.

41:26.430 --> 41:30.070
His brain will no longer
be able to oxygenate itself.

41:33.050 --> 41:35.240
I'm so sorry...

41:35.250 --> 41:39.310
that I can't offer you a
less dangerous solution.

41:41.770 --> 41:43.230
What do you mean?

41:43.240 --> 41:44.260
Didn't I mention it?

41:44.270 --> 41:46.520
Whatever you think you
said, you didn't say.

41:46.530 --> 41:48.060
The synaptic transfer system.

41:48.070 --> 41:49.340
The shared dream state.

41:49.350 --> 41:51.070
What do you mean shared dream state?

41:51.080 --> 41:55.520
The human brain generates a
quantifiable electric field.

41:55.820 --> 41:59.960
I posited in 1976 that it is possible

41:59.970 --> 42:03.490
to synchronize the fields
of two distinct minds

42:03.500 --> 42:08.130
to allow the sharing of information
across the unconscious state.

42:08.140 --> 42:10.470
Like a string between two tin cans.

42:10.480 --> 42:11.610
You know what's great about that?

42:11.620 --> 42:14.280
Is that it's completely insane.

42:14.300 --> 42:18.230
You're saying I can
talk to john in a coma

42:18.240 --> 42:21.120
and he can tell me what
the suspect looks like.

42:21.130 --> 42:24.410
- It's not an exact science.
- It's not even science.

42:24.420 --> 42:25.550
Have you done this before?

42:25.560 --> 42:30.940
I have used this technique to extract
information from a corpse once.

42:30.950 --> 42:33.880
You can do that if they haven't
been dead for longer than six hours.

42:33.890 --> 42:36.260
Right, 'cause after six hours,
that's when they're really dead.

42:36.270 --> 42:38.480
You could access his memories.

42:38.490 --> 42:40.330
Assuming there's no brain damage.

42:40.340 --> 42:43.480
Of course you'd have to
have an electromagnetic probe

42:43.520 --> 42:48.320
placed in the base of your skull whilst
immersed without clothing in the old tank.

42:48.340 --> 42:51.440
And you'd be heavily drugged.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.170
What sort of drugs?

42:58.180 --> 43:03.130
Oh, a mix of ketamine, neurontin,
lysergic acid diethylamide.

43:03.140 --> 43:05.680
That last one is
lsd, by the way--acid.

43:05.690 --> 43:06.870
Take at least a few hours.

43:06.890 --> 43:09.380
I'd need your help to synthesize
it if it's not too much trouble.

43:09.390 --> 43:11.590
Yeah, sure, no problem.
That sounds like fun.

43:11.600 --> 43:13.770
The man who was just released
from the mental institution,

43:13.780 --> 43:15.730
he wants to give you a drug overdose,

43:15.740 --> 43:19.820
then sick a metal rod into your head and
put you naked into a rusty tank of water.

43:19.830 --> 43:21.930
No, I don't want to.

43:21.940 --> 43:24.790
No, I'd rather not.
I'm just saying I can.

43:24.800 --> 43:27.580
Okay, olivia, excuse me for sec.

43:27.590 --> 43:29.770
Now you're obviously
under severe duress,

43:29.780 --> 43:32.290
and you haven't slept since iraq,
and the man you care about might die,

43:32.300 --> 43:34.550
but I'm telling you
that man will kill you.

43:34.560 --> 43:38.660
You don't understand the procedure.

43:40.390 --> 43:43.080
John would do it for me.

43:44.450 --> 43:45.420
Set it up.

43:45.430 --> 43:48.650
I'll get dhs authorization
to bring john here.

43:49.490 --> 43:53.410
This is unbelievable. This
is insane! He is insane!

43:53.420 --> 43:56.160
And you're insane for following him.

43:56.170 --> 43:57.500
Excellent.

43:57.510 --> 44:00.210
Let's make some lsd.

44:18.150 --> 44:20.700
put him over here.

44:34.170 --> 44:36.330
Salt'll make you float.

44:38.970 --> 44:41.830
Charlie, did you get me
in to see william bell?

44:41.840 --> 44:45.370
Massive dynamics isn't exactly
being forthcoming or courteous.

44:45.380 --> 44:48.530
And apparently, william bell is out
of the country for the next two weeks.

44:48.540 --> 44:49.430
What's this?

44:49.440 --> 44:52.250
A sweet little memo from
their general counsel.

44:52.260 --> 44:53.540
So bell doesn't want to talk?

44:53.550 --> 44:56.360
Or he's just being the head
of a $50 billion corporation.

44:56.370 --> 44:57.390
Oh, screw this.

44:57.400 --> 45:00.620
I want to drive a tank through william
bell's office and find out what he knows.

45:00.630 --> 45:03.510
I know you do, but I'm here
to tell you the bad news.

45:03.530 --> 45:06.530
It's gonna be another 48 hours
till we get a court order.

45:06.540 --> 45:09.340
You should probably
strip to your underwear.

45:09.670 --> 45:11.490
Hello.

45:11.990 --> 45:13.780
What the hell was that?

45:13.790 --> 45:15.280
Charlie, we don't have 48 hours.

45:15.290 --> 45:17.190
I need you to get to bell.

45:17.200 --> 45:20.290
If walter fails, bell could
be the only one to save us.

45:20.850 --> 45:22.730
Livvy, what's happening here?

45:22.770 --> 45:25.610
You've cleared all this with broyles?

45:25.620 --> 45:26.560
Somewhat.

45:26.570 --> 45:29.840
Somewhat doesn't sound good.

45:32.270 --> 45:33.450
Is that a cow?

45:33.460 --> 45:34.670
Yeah, that's gene.

45:34.680 --> 45:39.500
Listen, charlie, I-I need you to
promise me you'll do whatever you can.

45:39.510 --> 45:43.840
Of course. You know that.

45:47.030 --> 45:48.960
Be careful.

46:02.940 --> 46:05.120
My god.

46:22.440 --> 46:24.140
now where was I?

46:24.150 --> 46:27.650
Could you tilt your
head forward, please.

46:28.300 --> 46:33.320
I still think that this is deeply
irresponsible, and believe me, I would know.

46:34.990 --> 46:37.800
This is an anesthetic.

46:37.810 --> 46:39.120
I feel normal working.

46:39.130 --> 46:43.420
Yeah, 'cause bootlegging smack in the
basement is just the picture of normalcy.

46:51.570 --> 46:54.650
I got you. I got you.

47:02.130 --> 47:04.600
I hope your guy is worth it.

47:18.050 --> 47:20.500
And this...

47:20.510 --> 47:23.630
will rip open your consciousness.

47:44.780 --> 47:49.340
Listen, in case, you
don't come back, I just...

47:49.960 --> 47:55.670
wanted to say before we do this, how
much I appreciate what you've done.

47:56.520 --> 47:59.850
There are so many things you'll
lose in a place like that.

47:59.860 --> 48:02.900
You lose being trusted.

48:02.910 --> 48:06.960
Strange how important
that is once it's gone.

48:41.830 --> 48:44.470
If you want to watch,
you can come closer.

48:44.480 --> 48:45.900
Do you work here?

48:45.910 --> 48:49.490
Yeah, I'm astrid farnsworth,
assistant to agent dunham.

48:49.500 --> 48:51.360
Who?

48:51.370 --> 48:53.870
Oh, yes. I'm walter...

48:53.880 --> 48:55.170
bishop, walter bishop.

48:55.180 --> 48:56.130
Yes, thank you.

48:56.140 --> 48:57.380
Don't mention it.

48:57.390 --> 48:59.900
These are her brain rhythms.

48:59.910 --> 49:05.100
More important than most people know
regarding cerebral regional interaction.

49:05.120 --> 49:06.460
Critical.

49:06.470 --> 49:08.740
And--and
these are his.

49:08.750 --> 49:14.220
As the drugs take effect, the probes will
synchronize the electrical signals from both.

49:14.230 --> 49:17.840
That's what the brain
is, an electrical router.

49:17.850 --> 49:20.300
Should be able to be
interpreted by the other.

49:20.310 --> 49:23.070
Yeah, simple really. Like making taffy.

49:23.080 --> 49:29.110
Then when the rhythms are in synch, they
should be in the same place, so to speak.

49:29.120 --> 49:32.150
So what do we do now?

49:35.240 --> 49:37.850
Now we wait.

50:17.230 --> 50:19.060
What was that?

50:43.120 --> 50:46.070
Hello. Hello!

50:48.430 --> 50:53.220
I think I'm here. I
think I'm here. I'm here.

51:07.140 --> 51:08.820
John?

51:10.960 --> 51:13.570
That's my uncle's kayak.

51:19.620 --> 51:23.570
John? Is that you?

51:30.340 --> 51:33.610
- olivia.
- John.

51:37.080 --> 51:38.270
- What's happening?
- She's fine.

51:38.280 --> 51:39.880
- She's all right?
- She's fine.

51:39.890 --> 51:41.880
- You sure?
- Look.

51:50.560 --> 51:53.760
I was just thinking about you.

52:14.570 --> 52:16.710
What was that?

52:17.340 --> 52:18.860
Oh, nothing.

52:25.310 --> 52:28.370
John... you were hurt.

52:30.070 --> 52:32.860
I don't remember.

52:32.870 --> 52:35.420
Think.

52:35.430 --> 52:38.740
The storage units.

52:38.750 --> 52:41.520
I feel cold.

52:41.530 --> 52:44.140
I need you to remember.

52:44.150 --> 52:47.380
Remember what?

52:49.000 --> 52:51.260
What you saw.

52:51.270 --> 52:54.610
I need you to show me his face.

52:54.990 --> 52:57.330
Why?

53:01.770 --> 53:04.760
So I can save you.

53:06.040 --> 53:09.340
Please try.

53:09.590 --> 53:12.540
Try and remember.

53:25.830 --> 53:29.290
Yes, this is right. This is right.

53:46.730 --> 53:49.350
we got a runner in the
back. We need him alive.

53:49.710 --> 53:52.580
I can't see his face.

54:08.230 --> 54:09.220
Her leg!

54:09.230 --> 54:10.690
Oh, I saw him!

54:10.700 --> 54:15.110
I saw john get hurt. I was there.
I was there, I saw--I saw him.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.480
What do you mean you saw him? Where?

54:30.490 --> 54:33.200
I told you not to ask me that.

54:34.120 --> 54:37.360
This is him. This is the suspect
we're looking for.He looks like this

54:37.370 --> 54:39.160
send me the image. I'll
put it through the database.

54:39.170 --> 54:41.950
Have you slept? You look like crap.

54:41.960 --> 54:44.090
No primary matches for criminal record.

54:44.100 --> 54:48.190
Well, cross-check all state driver license
files and send this image to all local hospitals.

54:48.210 --> 54:51.350
Agent dunham, take a look at this.

54:56.230 --> 54:58.400
Oh, my god. This is him.

54:58.410 --> 55:00.210
He was a passenger on flight 627.

55:00.220 --> 55:01.770
- I don't-- I don't
understand. - Wait, wait, wait.

55:01.780 --> 55:03.180
He couldn't have been
at the storage place.

55:03.190 --> 55:06.400
- Charlie, I saw him there.
- hold on, guys.

55:06.410 --> 55:09.220
Morgan steig was passenger number 108.

55:09.230 --> 55:13.080
His emergency contact, richard steig.

55:13.090 --> 55:14.530
You're telling me he has a twin?

55:14.540 --> 55:17.890
Yeah, no home address, only
a history of employment.

55:17.900 --> 55:19.360
What?

55:19.370 --> 55:22.150
Richard steig's last employer.

55:28.110 --> 55:30.170
I was hoping to speak with william bell.

55:28.120 --> 55:32.720
<i>{\a6}MASSIVE DYNAMIC NEW YORK</i>

55:30.180 --> 55:32.760
I'm nina sharp, executive director.

55:32.770 --> 55:34.370
I only have a few minutes.

55:34.380 --> 55:38.740
our primary suspect is a former
employee of yours, richard steig,

55:38.750 --> 55:43.870
who may have used research from your company
to develop a self-eradicating airborne toxin.

55:43.880 --> 55:48.630
We don't know why or for whom, but it appears
he was willing to sacrifice his own brother.

55:48.640 --> 55:53.540
Whatever killed those people on that
plane got onboard through his insulin pen.

55:53.550 --> 55:56.660
So do you want to talk to me?

56:04.480 --> 56:06.460
Danielle...

56:06.470 --> 56:10.910
please assemble everything we have on
richard steig for agent dunham here.

56:13.040 --> 56:15.080
I remember richard steig.

56:15.090 --> 56:18.000
He worked in our weapons
systems research lab.

56:18.020 --> 56:22.740
He was caught three months ago trying to
leave the premises with classified information.

56:22.750 --> 56:24.610
He was terminated immediately.

56:24.620 --> 56:26.730
We referred his name to
the justice department.

56:26.740 --> 56:29.700
We have done our due
diligence, agent dunham.

56:29.710 --> 56:35.160
And if you choose to drag our company
and dr. Bell's name into this matter,

56:35.190 --> 56:37.270
you will be hearing from our attorneys.

56:37.280 --> 56:38.960
How long have you worked for dr. Bell?

56:38.970 --> 56:40.840
16 years.

56:40.850 --> 56:44.770
I owe massive dynamics my life,
and that is not an exaggeratioN.

56:44.780 --> 56:47.200
I s a runner most of my life.

56:47.210 --> 56:51.560
In the '97 boston marathon,
I felt strangely tired.

56:51.570 --> 56:57.090
One day at the office, dr. Bell noticed my
discomfort and insisted I go for a cat scan.

56:57.100 --> 56:59.410
Cancer.

57:00.950 --> 57:05.980
Spread so severely I had to
have my arm amputated that week.

57:05.990 --> 57:10.890
That first scanner that found my
cancer was built by this company.

57:10.900 --> 57:15.340
The robotic assist tools there were used in
my surgery, the drugs I took afterwards...

57:15.350 --> 57:19.120
were developed and manufactured
by massive dynamics.

57:19.130 --> 57:24.700
And my replacement limb was
designed by bell himself.

57:27.300 --> 57:31.390
Everything we have on richard steig.

57:31.930 --> 57:36.320
Do you believe that steig
may be part of the pattern?

57:36.330 --> 57:39.200
I'm sorry, part of the...

57:39.210 --> 57:41.260
part of the pattern?

57:41.270 --> 57:44.440
Oh, I assumed you had clearance.

57:45.650 --> 57:48.420
Well, I'm cleared to know whatever
you're cleared to know, ms. Sharp.

57:48.430 --> 57:51.210
Apparently not.

57:51.550 --> 57:55.000
But suffice to say that we've reached
a point where science and technology

57:55.010 --> 57:58.480
have advanced at such an
exponential rate for so long,

57:58.490 --> 58:03.320
it may be way beyond our ability
to regulate and control them.

58:04.740 --> 58:08.690
You should know what you're
getting into, agent dunham.

58:08.700 --> 58:11.750
I would say this to my own daughter.

58:11.760 --> 58:14.620
Be careful.

58:14.990 --> 58:18.220
And good luck.

58:23.630 --> 58:26.970
Keep the tree warm, sandy!
We're on our way to your house!

58:30.030 --> 58:32.090
And this is a show for children?

58:32.100 --> 58:34.160
Yeah, it's huge.

58:34.520 --> 58:38.670
Surprisingly profound for
a narrative about a sponge.

58:38.680 --> 58:40.060
Crazy house.

58:40.070 --> 58:41.980
I just landed at logan.
I'm on my way to you.

58:41.990 --> 58:43.920
I think we've located our suspect.

58:43.930 --> 58:45.910
Hold on a second. You found the guy?

58:45.920 --> 58:47.270
You found the guy from your dream.

58:47.280 --> 58:48.340
I'm picking you both up.

58:48.350 --> 58:49.840
I need your father
there to question him,

58:49.850 --> 58:52.070
get whatever information he needs
so he can make the cure for john.

58:52.080 --> 58:54.280
And I need you there too
in case your father's--

58:54.290 --> 58:56.550
say no more. We'll meet you out front.

58:59.780 --> 59:01.690
stay eyes on south side.

59:01.700 --> 59:03.790
red, stand by.

59:07.210 --> 59:09.550
rooftop, confirm your position.

59:10.540 --> 59:13.540
<i>{\a6}S*** BOSTON</i>

59:15.570 --> 59:17.010
Got one coming out.

59:18.050 --> 59:19.300
This way, ma'am.

59:30.410 --> 59:34.470
Clear! Clear! Clear!

59:36.240 --> 59:38.160
In the back!

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:12.240
I'd like to... check
your blood pressure.

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:15.500
Why don't you check your own blood
pressure? Mine's fine, thanks.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:20.520
Your skin tone suggests you might be
suffering from arterial hypertension.

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:22.370
Don't tell me what I'm suffering from.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:25.850
And there are no visible
signs of hypertension.

01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:32.550
When this over, please
don't send me back.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.770
I don't want to go back.

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:34.760
Look,
walter--

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:40.280
this experience...You
woke me up again, and...

01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:42.590
you can't put me back to sleep.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:46.550
It was hardly my idea, any of it.

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:51.520
Whatever punishment you think I deserve,

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:55.880
I swear I have already endured it.

01:00:56.870 --> 01:01:01.340
17 years. Please...

01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:03.740
son.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.140
What?

01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:16.080
He's in the alley!

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.150
Can I get out of the car?

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.400
Stay right there, walter!

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:34.590
We've got some questions for you.

01:02:36.110 --> 01:02:38.010
U.S.Code 1111.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:40.740
The murder of 147 passengers.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:43.380
U.S.Code 2332-A.

01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:46.060
Use of weapons of mass destruction.

01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:48.310
U.S.Code 2332-B.

01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:51.640
An act of terrorism
transcending national borders.

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:53.590
U.S.Code 1132-A.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.570
Attempted murder of a federal agent.

01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:58.920
You want immunity.

01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:04.540
I want a detailed account of all the synthetic
chemicals you had in that storage facility.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.660
Write them down.

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:09.370
And then we can talk about an agreement.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:19.780
I... have nothing... to say.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.100
Walter, stay here.

01:03:50.340 --> 01:04:06.000
Where
are you--

01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:07.940
the compound affecting agent scott.

01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:10.420
It's water soluble, right?

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:14.570
We might not know what it
is, but we know what it does.

01:04:14.590 --> 01:04:19.800
So if I wanted to, I could extract the
contagious fluids from his body and...

01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:23.460
that would allow me to slip
it to you whenever I wanted to.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.860
In your food.

01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:29.660
A cup of coffee.

01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:31.800
The toilet.

01:04:31.810 --> 01:04:34.750
Nobody would ever know how it happened.

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.490
The only problem is...

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:40.890
the woman who was just in here,
that's her friend who's dying.

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:43.930
So I just don't have that kind of time.

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.400
No!

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:47.830
Tell me the chemicals!

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:50.210
Hey, stop, stop! You
can't! You can't do that.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.010
No, you can't do that.

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.570
I want the names of the chemicals.

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.770
I'm gonna count to one.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.780
One!

01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:02.030
The active toxin was a
magnesium based ethylene glycol.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.580
No, I understand that, but
you're not listening to me.

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:06.170
Magnesium ethylene glycol
with an organophosphate trig--

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:07.610
walter, just stop for a second.

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.930
His blood won't be able to absorb
it before the side-effects kill him.

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:10.830
So you're saying what?

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:14.930
We synthesize a calcium
gluconate in a thiamine base?

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:15.860
Yes, exactly.

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:18.200
We can'T. We'd need more
of his blood. We have none.

01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:18.960
That's
not true--

01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:23.440
all agents are required to set up a
backup blood supply in case we're wounded.

01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:25.550
autologous transfusion.
That's brilliant.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:28.960
We can create the antidote and then just
dissolve it into scott's stored blood.

01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:32.100
If we transfuse him intravenously,
his body won't be overwhelmed.

01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:35.480
A+, boY. Well done. Let's begin.

01:05:58.670 --> 01:06:00.810
So I got the lab.

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:04.080
Yeah, I know you did.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.810
Thanks.

01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:12.380
How's it goin' downstairs?

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:20.920
bishop says it'll be awhile,
but that it's looking auspicious.

01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:23.730
That was his word.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:25.400
What?

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:28.250
You've done some solid work here.

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:32.930
Locating bishop. Getting him out.
Finding a way to get him to work with you.

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:35.260
We're impressed.

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:37.820
Who's "we"?

01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:42.140
What happened on that plane might be part of
something more dangerous than just simple terrorism.

01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:44.780
Simple terrorism?

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:52.120
In the past nine months, there have been three dozen
authenticated incidents like the hamburg flight.

01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:56.040
John thompson, normal kid,
went missing back in '98.

01:06:56.050 --> 01:07:00.390
Reappeared last month halfway
around the world. Hadn't aged a day.

01:07:00.930 --> 01:07:05.230
In the past few months, 46 other children
who went missing that same year turn up.

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.740
Same story.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:12.770
Local fisherman off the coast of sri lanka reports
a low-flying plane emitting a high-pitch frequency

01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:15.060
that blows out all their windows.

01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:17.040
An hour later, same spot,

01:07:17.050 --> 01:07:23.070
an 8.7 sub-surface earthquake creates
a tsunami that kills 83,000 people.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.280
- So why are you
telling me-- - this man.

01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:30.450
A patient in lisbon who woke up after
years in a coma began writing just numbers.

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:35.620
They turn out to be exact real-time coordinates
of our carrier battle groups in the pacific.

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:38.400
Intel that's classified
above top-secret.

01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:40.020
So how is that even possible?

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.410
Come work for me, and I'll
get you the clearance--

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:43.860
oh, stop.

01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:44.780
Dunham, there's more you need to hear.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.700
You must not have heard me. I said stop.

01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:48.430
They're calling these
events "the pattern."

01:07:48.450 --> 01:07:51.370
As if someone out there is experimenting,
only the whole world is their lab.

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:52.690
You've seen it, now you know.

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.350
I don't wanna know. I have a job.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.040
This is a more important job.

01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:59.010
Anything, anybody you
need, you can have.

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:00.990
I like the job I've got.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.450
And the man I do it with. Which you
seem to have deduced on your own.

01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:06.320
Look around.

01:08:06.330 --> 01:08:08.310
You see all these people
going about their lives.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:12.210
No idea what's happening around
them, what they're in the middle of.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.090
I just wanna go back to before.

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:22.050
Dunham. I don't think you can.

01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:21.479
He's up. He's awake.

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:24.170
Olivia, olivia, he's
awake! He's conscious.

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:25.830
John?

01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:32.170
John, can you hear me, baby? Baby?

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.760
I had a dream about you.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.640
Uh, a change of clothes for agent scott.

01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:09.300
His vitals are surprisingly strong.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.540
So, um, how long does he have to stay?

01:10:12.570 --> 01:10:16.430
Until the melanocytes in his skin have
regenerated, but that shouldn't be more than a week.

01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:19.340
He owes you his life.

01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:22.200
We owe each other.

01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:30.360
What room is steig in?

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.750
I told you everything I know. Didn't I?

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.970
I gave you the names of all the
synthetics I used in the compound.

01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:40.970
Don't worry, our
immunity agreement holds.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.170
But there's still a whole lot
more we have to talk about.

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:45.080
Like, why you killed your own brother?

01:10:45.090 --> 01:10:46.570
And who you're selling your work to?

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:48.340
Who says I was selling it?

01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:51.710
I was threatened by a
guy from your office.

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.190
You think I'm lying?

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.530
I swear to god.

01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:00.380
I can prove it.

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:03.680
- Where's the recording?
- I buried it.

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:47.720
Who is this?

01:11:47.730 --> 01:11:49.230
we had an exchange agreement.

01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:51.400
hmm, there have been other bidders.

01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:54.390
Today, the airplane was a demonstration.

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:56.280
you've drawn unwarranted attention.

01:11:56.290 --> 01:11:59.090
Something we can't afford
to be connected with.

01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:01.260
I'll make this simple. You're
not selling to anyone else.

01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:02.880
You do that, we will come after you.

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:04.880
I will come after you.

01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:08.660
you're threatening me after seeing what
I'm willing to do to my own brother?

01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:11.920
well, let me assure you, we'd be
happy to treat you as family too.

01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:15.650
Well, let me assure you. We'd be
happy to treat you as family too.

01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:29.940
Special agent scott.

01:12:29.950 --> 01:12:34.920
Yes, sir, go right ahead.

01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:01.650
charlie, I need two agents posted
outside agent scott's room now.

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:02.910
Check on steig.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.200
I'm on it.

01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:06.280
I'm five minutes away.

01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:12.370
We need this place locked down!

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:28.260
This is dunham, agent I.D.52776 In pursuit
of blue suv heading south on fenway.

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:30.430
Need immediate assist.

01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:27.090
Ask yourself why...

01:15:30.450 --> 01:15:37.900
why broyles sent you
to the storage facility.

01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:42.700
Why you?

01:15:42.710 --> 01:15:45.660
Why? I don't understand.

01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:50.640
Who are you working for?

01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:54.600
John, tell me.

01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:57.670
Tell me more, john.

01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:54.290
I knew him just as long as you did.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.580
I'm sorry.

01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:06.370
Job isn't what it was ten years ago.

01:17:07.690 --> 01:17:10.480
We're supposed to protect a world

01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:15.150
where one breath of the wrong air can
incinerate you from the inside out.

01:17:16.990 --> 01:17:19.890
I mean, how do we protect people

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:25.100
when corporations have higher
security clearances than we do?

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:30.230
When we're not fully briefed on half
the things that we're investigating?

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:33.360
You know, when the truth...

01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:42.270
the truth is we're obsolete.

01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:49.040
Take me back to the lab.

01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:09.890
Can I talk to you please?

01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:11.810
Yeah. I'll be back in a second.

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:16.370
Though I'm sure you're anxious to
get as far away from here as possible.

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:19.950
To iraq or afghanistan or
countless other out of reach places,

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:22.300
but I'm here to tell you that
your father needs to stay.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.900
Which means that you need to too.

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:26.970
Are you okay?

01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:32.820
No, I-I-I-I know that you have countless
reasons as to why this is a non-starter for you.

01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:35.960
But, I mean, your father is a good man.

01:18:35.970 --> 01:18:38.050
He's not the monster you think he is.

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:40.260
And you're good with him,
despite what you think.

01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:42.710
And you're the only
one who speaks walter.

01:18:42.730 --> 01:18:45.320
We take him back to st.
Claire's and it's all over.

01:18:45.330 --> 01:18:47.230
Where's john?

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:49.490
I can talk to the agency and get
them to clear your gambling debts.

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:54.330
I can take care of my own debts,
okay? What just happened? Where's john?

01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:56.710
I'm not gonna use false
threats with you anymore.

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:59.500
I don't need to.

01:18:59.970 --> 01:19:02.830
The threats are real.

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:10.500
After you left, my father sat down and started
talking to me and he was remarkably lucid.

01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:14.580
He told me about the work. That he and
william bell had done their experiments.

01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:19.660
And that incident-- what happened
on the plane is just the beginning.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:25.990
Which makes every part of me feel
like I gotta get the hell outta boston.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.240
are we leaving?

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.600
Are we leaving?

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.600
How long has he been dead?

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:18.040
five hours.

01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:21.570
Question him.
