00:15.300 --> 00:17.867
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold up, hold up, hold up.

00:17.867 --> 00:20.200
If we're gonna win
Battle of the Bands,

00:20.200 --> 00:22.233
we got to rock
that stage.

00:22.233 --> 00:24.567
It's all about showmanship.

00:24.567 --> 00:27.900
Ladies and gentlemen,
Freddy on the drums!

00:27.900 --> 00:30.167
[all cheering]

00:30.167 --> 00:31.500
- Yeah.

00:31.500 --> 00:34.167
- I love it.
Lawrence on the keys!

00:35.600 --> 00:38.033
- Yeah.
Yeah.

00:38.033 --> 00:40.367
Oh! Ho ho ho!

00:40.367 --> 00:43.267
Lawrence von Butthoven.

00:43.267 --> 00:45.900
Tomika, rock out
front and center!

00:45.900 --> 00:46.900
[all cheering]
- [playing bass]

00:46.900 --> 00:48.733
- Tomika!

Tomika.

00:50.067 --> 00:51.400
[playing bass]

00:51.400 --> 00:54.233
Or rock out crouched
behind that speaker.

00:54.233 --> 00:56.467
- Mm!
- Tomika.

00:56.467 --> 00:57.400
Tomika.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.100
- [screeches]
- Oh!

00:59.100 --> 01:01.533
Tomika.
- Okay.

01:01.533 --> 01:04.367
- What's going on?
Why are you hiding back there?

01:04.367 --> 01:07.300
- Some of us don't need
to draw attention to ourselves.

01:07.300 --> 01:09.700
- Summer
on the tambourine!

01:09.700 --> 01:12.167
Check it out.
I'm literally on the tambourine.

01:12.167 --> 01:14.833
Ha!

01:14.833 --> 01:17.200
- And some of us do.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.500
- Come on, Tomika,
get into it.

01:19.500 --> 01:22.633
A-all the rock legends have
their signature moves.

01:22.633 --> 01:25.467
Uh, Mick Jagger has
his Rooster Strut.

01:27.067 --> 01:28.833
And Miley Cyrus has
her twerk.

01:28.833 --> 01:30.867
- Okay.
- Mm.

01:30.867 --> 01:34.133
- And Dewey Finn has
the Speaker Straddle.

01:34.133 --> 01:37.333
- If it keeps you from twerking,
go for it.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.500
- It's a move I created
for my short-lived

01:39.500 --> 01:42.633
and poorly-named band,
The Everlasting.

01:42.633 --> 01:44.400
- Careful, Mr. Finn.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.067
- Chillax, I'm just trying
to prove a point

01:47.067 --> 01:48.867
about showmanship
to Tomika.

01:48.867 --> 01:51.233
[all yelling]

01:51.233 --> 01:53.367
all: Mr. Finn!
- Oh!

01:56.300 --> 01:59.067
- Uh, I think
I've made my point.

01:59.067 --> 02:00.100
- [grunts]

02:00.100 --> 02:01.733
- [groans]

02:01.733 --> 02:04.767
- * Stop tellin' me
to read between the lines *

02:04.767 --> 02:07.333
* It all adds up
to one thing *

02:07.333 --> 02:08.933
- Five, four, three,
two, one.

02:08.933 --> 02:11.467
- * If you think you're gonna
lose your cool *

02:11.467 --> 02:14.100
* Well, sometimes you gotta
break the rules *

* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

02:16.867 --> 02:18.667
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

you're gettin' schooled *

02:22.300 --> 02:24.800

* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

- * Are you ready to rock?

02:33.867 --> 02:35.833
[rock music]

02:35.833 --> 02:39.633
- Tomika, wait.
Wait up.

02:39.633 --> 02:41.767
- Still hurting
from your fall?

02:41.767 --> 02:43.833
- Fall?
I don't recall any fall,

02:43.833 --> 02:46.733
just a killer rock move
that I totally meant to do.

02:46.733 --> 02:49.400
Tomika, you're usually
so confident when you play,

02:49.400 --> 02:50.700
and we need you to be
at your best

02:50.700 --> 02:52.433
if we're going to win
Battle of the Bands.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.467
What's going on?

02:54.467 --> 02:56.167
- My brothers filmed me
practicing at home

02:56.167 --> 02:57.500
and put it
on the Internet.

02:57.500 --> 03:00.267
It turns out I make funny faces
when I play.

03:00.267 --> 03:03.400
- All the great basses
suffer from bass face.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.300
I bet you look cool.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.100
[goat bleating effect]

03:08.100 --> 03:09.667
I was insanely wrong.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.333
Who cares?

03:12.333 --> 03:14.533
- They made another one.

03:14.533 --> 03:15.733
[elephant trumpeting effect]

03:15.733 --> 03:17.600
- [giggles]

03:17.600 --> 03:19.400
That's not funny.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.767
- And this.

03:21.767 --> 03:23.600
[burping effect]

03:23.600 --> 03:28.067
- I can't believe you actually
came to school today.

03:28.067 --> 03:31.533
- Thanks, Mr. Finn.
You're a sensitive soul.

03:31.533 --> 03:33.967
- So your brothers made
a dumb video.

03:33.967 --> 03:35.733
- It's not the video.
It's not even

03:35.733 --> 03:37.667
that all my brothers' friends
have seen it.

03:37.667 --> 03:40.067
It's that this is
how I look when I play,

03:40.067 --> 03:41.833
like a total doofus.

03:41.833 --> 03:43.900
I can't let people see me
that way anymore.

03:43.900 --> 03:46.300
- [scoffs]
My point is you're fearless

03:46.300 --> 03:49.067
on the skateboard.
Bring that to your rock.

03:49.067 --> 03:50.467
Who's your favorite artist?

03:50.467 --> 03:52.633
- I'm totally
into Demi Lovato.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.233
- Perfect.
Demi Lovato was shy,

03:55.233 --> 03:56.633
but when she got
onstage,

03:56.633 --> 03:59.267
she transformed herself
into a confident rocker.

03:59.267 --> 04:02.700
Now she owns it.
Be like her.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.400
- I don't know
if I can do it.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.333
- Trust me, Tomika.
I know Demi Lovato--

04:07.333 --> 04:11.200
- Wh--really?
You know Demi Lovato?

04:11.200 --> 04:12.533
- Well, I meant that--

04:12.533 --> 04:14.367
- That is so cool!

04:14.367 --> 04:16.067
- It is?

04:16.067 --> 04:19.567
Yeah, it is cool that
I know Demi Lovato.

04:19.567 --> 04:23.567
So are you gonna start rocking
like Demi Lovato?

04:23.567 --> 04:26.067
Who I totally know.

04:26.067 --> 04:27.567
- I guess I can try.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.600
- That's the spirit.
I'm gonna call Demi

04:29.600 --> 04:31.767
and tell her
all about you.

04:31.767 --> 04:34.700
- [squeals]

04:36.100 --> 04:39.067
- Who is Demi Lovato?

04:42.067 --> 04:43.167

04:43.167 --> 04:46.333
- Whoa.
Cool new style.

04:46.333 --> 04:47.567
- Thanks, Zack.

04:47.567 --> 04:51.100
I went with the superhero
underwear today.

04:51.100 --> 04:53.433
- We can't actually see
your underwear.

04:53.433 --> 04:55.933
- You can see it
in my confident strut.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.400
- Hey, Summer.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.533
- Tomika,
I love your hair.

05:01.533 --> 05:03.767
- Thanks.
I've decided to stop hiding

05:03.767 --> 05:05.767
and be more like my hero,
Demi Lovato.

05:05.767 --> 05:09.600
- Well, it's working.
You look like a total rock star.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.200
I wish I could
pull that off.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.067
- You can.
Pull.

05:15.500 --> 05:16.567
- [laughs]

05:16.567 --> 05:19.067
- You just got
rock-star-ed.

05:19.067 --> 05:23.767
* You make me...
both: * Glo-o-ow

05:23.767 --> 05:29.467
* But I cover up
won't let it sho-o-ow *

05:29.467 --> 05:31.400
* So I--

05:31.400 --> 05:34.533
[rock music]

05:36.900 --> 05:39.867
- Well, it says here
I was wrong.

05:39.867 --> 05:42.633
Lightning is actually frozen
moisture colliding,

05:42.633 --> 05:44.100
creating a static charge,

05:44.100 --> 05:46.533
and not, as I had
previously stated,

05:46.533 --> 05:48.867
two angels
in a fist fight.

05:48.867 --> 05:50.500
Hmm.

05:50.500 --> 05:54.467
Oh, let's put the books away
and hit The Rolling Stones hard.

05:55.867 --> 05:58.967
- Guys, I was thinking
that maybe

05:58.967 --> 06:00.500
instead of playing
"Under My Thumb,"

06:00.500 --> 06:02.100
we could change it up
a little bit.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.433
- Oh, What's this?

06:03.433 --> 06:05.533
- Sheet music for Demi Lovato's
"Heart Attack."

06:05.533 --> 06:07.167
- Sweet!

06:07.167 --> 06:10.200
Wait, it's cool for dudes
to like Demi Lovato, right?

06:10.200 --> 06:11.200
- Yeah.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.300
- Sweet!

06:13.300 --> 06:15.933
- If it makes Tomika look good,
it makes the band look good.

06:15.933 --> 06:19.500
Me, I look good
either way.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.067
- Let's do this.

06:21.067 --> 06:23.633
- Yeah!
My booty's ready to jam.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.733
[keyboard flourish]

06:25.733 --> 06:29.233
- Thanks, guys.
Follow my lead.

06:29.233 --> 06:31.067
- Let's do this!

06:31.067 --> 06:34.967
- * So I'm
puttin' my defenses up *

06:34.967 --> 06:37.900
* 'Cause I don't wanna
fall in love *

06:37.900 --> 06:39.233
* If I ever did that

06:39.233 --> 06:42.600
* I think I'd have
a heart attack *

06:42.600 --> 06:44.633
[all cheering]
- [laughs]

06:44.633 --> 06:46.867
That's what I've been
looking for.

06:46.867 --> 06:48.867
- Tomika, you kicked
that song's butt.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.667
- All I needed to do was
be more like Demi.

06:51.667 --> 06:54.500
Maybe you could take a video
of us and send it to her.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.600
Mr. Finn is friends
with Demi Lovato.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.467
- What?
- No way, that's so cool!

06:59.467 --> 07:00.833
- My mom knows the guy

07:00.833 --> 07:02.133
from the light-up slippers
commercial.

07:02.133 --> 07:03.600
- Oh, the guy
with the slippers?

07:03.600 --> 07:06.233
- No, the one who falls
down the stairs.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.067
- Wait, do you actually
hang out with her?

07:10.067 --> 07:14.233
- Uh, sure, you know,
whenever she's in town.

07:14.233 --> 07:16.400
- Demi Lovato's in town
this week.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.767
- We're in town this week!

07:18.767 --> 07:20.067
- No way.
She is?

07:20.067 --> 07:22.067
- Yeah, she's playing
Texas Memorial.

07:22.067 --> 07:25.767
- She is.
I knew that.

07:25.767 --> 07:27.633
- Mr. Finn, get her
to come see us play.

07:27.633 --> 07:31.067
- That would be the coolest
thing you've ever done!

07:31.067 --> 07:32.100
Can you?

07:32.100 --> 07:33.267
- Yeah, I can do

07:33.267 --> 07:34.900
the coolest thing
I've ever done.

07:34.900 --> 07:37.300
- Yeah!
- Man, no reason to believe

07:37.300 --> 07:39.233
this isn't gonna happen.

07:41.300 --> 07:44.233
[rock music]

07:47.300 --> 07:48.700
- [clears throat]

07:48.700 --> 07:50.933
- Welcome to the Saint Teresa
Hotel, can I help you?

07:50.933 --> 07:52.833
- Hi, I'm friends
with Demi Lovato,

07:52.833 --> 07:54.067
but I forgot
her room number.

07:54.067 --> 07:55.933
Could you please
give it to me?

07:55.933 --> 07:57.733
- I'm sorry,
I'm not allowed to give out

07:57.733 --> 08:00.100
guests' personal
information.

08:00.100 --> 08:03.067
- Mm.

08:05.133 --> 08:06.167
How about now?

08:07.900 --> 08:12.633
- Sir, this is a prescription
for a fungal medicine.

08:12.633 --> 08:14.967
- I'm gonna need that.

08:14.967 --> 08:16.833
Come on, man,
what's the room number?

08:16.833 --> 08:18.133
- Mr. Finn?

08:18.133 --> 08:20.067
- Lawrence,
what are you doing here?

08:20.067 --> 08:22.067
- Our house is being
fumigated for termites,

08:22.067 --> 08:23.400
so we're staying here.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.067
- I'm sorry about that.

08:25.067 --> 08:26.900
- No, it's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.167
They give you
a free robe,

08:28.167 --> 08:29.900
and you get a new shampoo
every day

08:29.900 --> 08:32.733
whether you take a shower
or not.

08:32.733 --> 08:36.100
Want some?
- No--pomegranate?

08:36.100 --> 08:37.833
- What are you doing here?

08:37.833 --> 08:38.933
- I'm trying to figure out

08:38.933 --> 08:41.400
what room my friend
is staying in.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.433
- I'm in 812.

08:43.433 --> 08:46.233
- Lawrence, don't you have
anything better to do?

08:46.233 --> 08:47.800
- No.
I've got 15 minutes

08:47.800 --> 08:49.800
until my mom and I have
our couples massage.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.067
- Hmm.
- Sir, there's no one

08:52.067 --> 08:54.067
under the name
Demi Lovato.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.733
- She's obviously using
a fake name

08:56.733 --> 08:59.833
so regular fans,
not close friends like me,

08:59.833 --> 09:02.133
don't bug her.
I'll have to guess.

09:02.133 --> 09:04.600
- You're her friend; why
don't you call her and ask her?

09:04.600 --> 09:05.900
- More fun to guess.

09:05.900 --> 09:09.267
Is there a "Demi Roboto"
staying here?

09:09.267 --> 09:11.633
- No one's checked in
under that name.

09:11.633 --> 09:13.067
- How about "Lemi Cravato"?
- Nope.

09:13.067 --> 09:14.367
- "Stemmy Avocado"?
- No.

09:14.367 --> 09:17.067
- Marjorie Weinstein?
I like this game.

09:17.067 --> 09:18.600
- Stop acting silly.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.867
"Cray Cray McFakeName"?

09:19.867 --> 09:21.300
- Security!

09:21.300 --> 09:23.867
- Security?
They said the shampoo's free.

09:23.867 --> 09:25.333
You're on your own,
Mr. Finn.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.533

20:32.500 --> 20:34.133
- Why didn't you
say anything?

20:34.133 --> 20:36.067
- I didn't want to steal
your thunder,

20:36.067 --> 20:39.367
until I realized
you didn't have any thunder.

20:39.367 --> 20:41.500
- Or the legs
for that dress.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.467
- She said we could get
tickets to her show anytime.

20:45.467 --> 20:47.300
- But tonight's anytime.

20:47.300 --> 20:50.967
- Everybody,
to the van!

20:50.967 --> 20:52.700
Hey.

20:52.700 --> 20:55.367
I hope you learned your lesson,
to always be yourself.

20:55.367 --> 20:56.900
- I have.

20:56.900 --> 21:00.867
But this will make sure
I never forget it.

21:00.867 --> 21:03.367
- That's why I do this.

21:03.367 --> 21:05.133
Oh.

21:05.133 --> 21:07.433
I should have gone
with the waterproof mascara.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.433
[sniffs]

21:09.433 --> 21:11.433
Man up, Dewey.

21:11.433 --> 21:12.467
Let's go.

21:12.467 --> 21:14.933
