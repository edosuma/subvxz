WEBVTT

00:02.407 --> 00:04.742
All right, let's play one more time, okay?

00:04.909 --> 00:07.954
And remember, if I win,
you do not move to Paris.

00:08.121 --> 00:11.249
Okay. I can't believe
I'm risking this again, but you're on.

00:11.416 --> 00:15.044
All right, Joe, you remember the rules.
Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.

00:15.211 --> 00:16.588
Just flip.

00:18.298 --> 00:20.467
- Tails!
- Damn it!

00:21.509 --> 00:24.721
So we thought we'd throw you
a little going-away party around 7.

00:24.888 --> 00:26.473
Oh, that sounds good.

00:26.639 --> 00:29.642
Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow.
Shouldn't you be packing?

00:29.809 --> 00:32.395
- It's all done.
- Oh, yeah, right.

00:32.561 --> 00:36.983
And after I took a shower this morning,
I just threw my towel on the floor.

00:37.150 --> 00:40.069
- Oh, God, it hurts to even joke about it.
- I know.

00:40.445 --> 00:44.282
Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage
that I'm taking is in the bedroom.

00:44.449 --> 00:48.119
This is Emma's Paris stuff. These are
the boxes that I'm having shipped...

00:48.286 --> 00:50.580
...and that's the sandwich
I made for the plane.

00:50.747 --> 00:53.082
- Okay, you've done some good work.
- Yeah.

00:53.249 --> 00:54.626
What about your carry-ons?

00:54.792 --> 00:58.004
Oh, well, everything that I need
is in here...

00:58.171 --> 01:00.632
...and my travel documents
are on the counter...

01:00.798 --> 01:03.885
...organized in the order
that I will be needing them.

01:04.052 --> 01:07.680
Oh, my God.
I have nothing left to teach you.

01:09.766 --> 01:13.144
- Where's your passport?
- It should be next to my plane ticket.

01:13.311 --> 01:16.606
- Well, it's not.
- What? Maybe I put it in here?

01:16.773 --> 01:19.359
Oh! Oh, it's not in there!

01:19.526 --> 01:22.111
Oh, no, I must have packed it
in one of these boxes!

01:22.403 --> 01:25.281
- Here, let me help you.
- Shoot.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.743
I can't believe I did this.

01:28.910 --> 01:32.622
At what point did it stop being funny
that I took her passport?

02:24.090 --> 02:26.634
Oh, wow, can you believe
you're only three weeks away?

02:26.801 --> 02:28.136
I know.

02:28.303 --> 02:32.056
- You don't mind me touching your belly?
- I don't mind you touching my belly...

02:32.223 --> 02:35.310
...but your hand's kind of blocking the
part where the baby's gonna come out.

02:38.896 --> 02:40.231
- Hey!
- Hey.

02:40.398 --> 02:44.986
Hi, Erica. Welcome back to town.
Wow, look how big you've gotten.

02:45.153 --> 02:47.238
That's because I'm pregnant.

02:47.989 --> 02:50.950
- Right. No, I understand.
- Oh, okay.

02:51.117 --> 02:54.704
I'm just always afraid that people think
I'm just fat with big breasts.

02:55.663 --> 02:57.498
No, no, I knew.

03:01.336 --> 03:04.714
- Okay, well, stop staring at them.
- She brought them up.

03:06.591 --> 03:08.760
I didn't realize
you were coming back so soon.

03:08.926 --> 03:11.054
In a couple weeks
I won't be able to travel.

03:11.220 --> 03:14.641
I wanted her to get to know the doctors
and get settled into the hotel.

03:14.849 --> 03:19.103
- Why isn't she staying with you guys?
- Because we're moving in a couple days.

03:19.270 --> 03:23.441
Plus, hotels are fun! My room has
this little fridge full of free snacks.

03:24.692 --> 03:26.444
Erica, those things aren't free.

03:26.611 --> 03:29.739
In fact, they have one of the highest
markups of any consumer product...

03:29.906 --> 03:33.826
Ross, she's giving us her baby.
She can eat you if she wants.

03:35.453 --> 03:37.538
I'll be right back.

03:40.041 --> 03:42.919
Oh, man, I can't believe you guys
are leaving this place.

03:43.086 --> 03:45.630
I know. I know.

03:45.797 --> 03:49.384
You know, you could take it if you want.
The lease is still in Nana's name.

03:49.550 --> 03:53.304
No, no. This will always be your place.
It would be too sad.

03:53.471 --> 03:55.890
Plus, how much a month does it cost
to feed Joey?

03:56.057 --> 03:57.350
Yeah, it takes two incomes.

03:58.393 --> 04:00.645
Hey, is Chandler here?
We talked about catching a movie.

04:00.812 --> 04:02.397
Oh, no, he doesn't have time for that.

04:02.563 --> 04:04.982
You can go help him and Joey
pack up the guest room.

04:05.149 --> 04:08.820
Hmm. Packing.
Sexy cheerleader comedy.

04:08.986 --> 04:13.700
Hmm. Helpful brother.
Creepy loner at teen movie.

04:15.284 --> 04:17.161
(Creep)'

04:25.086 --> 04:29.173
- What are you guys doing?
- Try it. I can't feel a thing.

04:36.431 --> 04:38.349
Are you kidding?

04:39.976 --> 04:42.228
- This is packing?
- We're taking a break.

04:42.395 --> 04:43.896
From?

04:44.063 --> 04:45.982
Jumping on the bed.

04:46.566 --> 04:50.278
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple
of hours, and there's a lot to do.

04:50.445 --> 04:53.489
Ross, you've got Geller blood.
You're in charge of these yahoos.

04:53.656 --> 04:55.116
- You got it.
- All right.

04:55.283 --> 04:57.493
She's right. We gotta get serious.

04:57.660 --> 05:00.663
Let's put Styrofoam peanuts
down his pants and kick him!

05:02.623 --> 05:06.461
No, guys, she's right. We should get
to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet.

05:06.627 --> 05:10.131
Joey, you pack them, and Ross,
you repack whatever Joey packs.

05:14.677 --> 05:16.137
You guys hear a ringing?

05:18.055 --> 05:23.603
- What the hell is this?
- Hey, handcuffs. And fur-lined. Nice.

05:23.770 --> 05:26.147
I didn't know you guys had it in you.

05:27.023 --> 05:29.942
Chandler, you don't have a sister,
so you can't understand...

05:30.109 --> 05:32.820
...how much this bums me out.

05:33.321 --> 05:36.032
I didn't know Monica had these.

05:36.199 --> 05:40.328
Maybe she used them
with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard.

05:42.580 --> 05:46.334
Why would she use them with Richard
and not me? I can be kinky.

05:46.918 --> 05:51.547
I once did a naked dance for her
with scarves.

05:54.175 --> 05:56.219
Bumming hard, guys. Bumming hard.

06:04.227 --> 06:05.269
- Hey.
- Hey. Where's Mike?

06:05.436 --> 06:06.854
Oh, he has a gig.

06:07.021 --> 06:09.857
It's kind of like being married
to a rock star, you know?

06:10.024 --> 06:12.109
My husband has a gig.

06:13.236 --> 06:14.570
Yeah? Where is it?

06:14.737 --> 06:18.950
Oh, he's playing organ
for a children's roller-skating party.

06:20.660 --> 06:22.328
Rock on!

06:23.412 --> 06:26.207
Wow, this is quite a spread.
What is all this stuff?

06:26.374 --> 06:29.710
Well, I thought this would be a great
opportunity to use up all the food...

06:29.877 --> 06:32.296
...that I don't want to move
to the new house with me.

06:32.463 --> 06:38.052
So enjoy. Smoked oyster casserole
with a breakfast-cereal crust.

06:39.220 --> 06:45.059
Kidney beans in their own juices,
and for dessert, a questionable orange.

06:46.310 --> 06:47.645
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:47.812 --> 06:49.939
- Where's Rach?
- She's putting Emma down.

06:50.106 --> 06:53.109
She'll be over in a second.
It just hit her that she's leaving.

06:53.276 --> 06:56.529
She's kind of emotional, no one
say anything to set her off, okay?

06:56.737 --> 06:57.780
Yeah.

06:58.614 --> 06:59.949
Hey, Rach. Hey.

07:00.116 --> 07:02.076
There she is.

07:02.493 --> 07:04.787
Hi, you guys.

07:05.204 --> 07:06.747
What did I just say?

07:08.749 --> 07:11.502
Oh, no, no, no, it's okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna be fine.

07:11.669 --> 07:14.255
- Come, I'll make you a drink.
- Okay.

07:15.298 --> 07:17.967
Oh, man, I can't believe
she's actually leaving.

07:18.134 --> 07:19.969
How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?

07:20.344 --> 07:22.763
I know, she's been
such a big part of my life.

07:22.930 --> 07:25.600
It feels like when Melrose Place
got canceled.

07:30.021 --> 07:31.689
I mean...

07:32.356 --> 07:35.109
Ah, forget it, I miss Melrose Place.

07:36.694 --> 07:39.155
- I had a chance to stop her too.
- Yeah?

07:39.322 --> 07:42.992
Who loses 57 coin tosses in a row?
You know?

07:43.159 --> 07:46.120
Heads, she wins. Tails, I lose.

07:51.042 --> 07:52.752
Wait a minute.

07:52.919 --> 07:57.131
- Yes, Joe?
- I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning.

08:00.635 --> 08:02.845
So you doing okay?

08:03.012 --> 08:06.515
Well, I've been better.
You guys are gonna come visit, right?

08:06.682 --> 08:10.061
Yes. You know, in six months,
the statute of limitations runs out...

08:10.227 --> 08:13.022
...and I can travel internationally again.

08:14.941 --> 08:18.319
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I know.

08:19.153 --> 08:22.198
You know what? Um, I have some
goodbye stuff that I wanted to say...

08:22.365 --> 08:27.495
...to each of you. And I was gonna save it
till the end of the night, but come here.

08:29.914 --> 08:32.457
Hey, what do you think
they're doing in there?

08:32.667 --> 08:34.376
If I had to guess, I'd say...

08:34.543 --> 08:38.172
...Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap,
and Phoebe's doing the punching.

08:41.717 --> 08:43.928
Pheebs, I don't even know
where to start.

08:44.095 --> 08:46.138
- Okay, well, before you do...
- Uh-huh.

08:46.305 --> 08:48.683
I know we weren't supposed
to get you presents...

08:48.849 --> 08:52.103
- ...but I do have something for you.
- Oh! Oh!

08:52.269 --> 08:53.604
Oh.

08:53.771 --> 08:55.856
- What is it?
- Well, it's a cotton swab...

08:56.023 --> 08:57.817
...with a bit of my saliva on it...

08:59.610 --> 09:03.239
...so that if they perfect the cloning
process while you're over there...

09:03.406 --> 09:06.659
...you can use the DNA
to create your own Pheebs.

09:10.788 --> 09:12.623
I'm gonna throw this away...

09:14.250 --> 09:18.129
...but thank you so much
for the gesture.

09:19.422 --> 09:21.090
Chandler?

09:21.257 --> 09:25.469
Um, I was just in our bedroom,
and I found these on my pillow.

09:26.387 --> 09:29.265
Oh, yes, I decided to leave those
out for you in case Richard stops by...

09:29.432 --> 09:33.561
...and you want to engage in a little
light bondage and mustache play.

09:34.979 --> 09:36.897
What are you talking about?
These aren't mine.

09:37.064 --> 09:38.274
Oh, yeah, right!

09:38.441 --> 09:41.402
Good luck getting another scarf dance
from me.

09:42.486 --> 09:44.905
That would be a terrible punishment.

09:46.741 --> 09:48.868
But I'm serious,
I've never seen these before.

09:49.035 --> 09:52.079
Really? Then what are they doing
in our guest room?

09:52.413 --> 09:54.206
Rachel used to live in that room.

09:54.373 --> 09:57.960
Rachel. With handcuffs.

09:58.127 --> 09:59.795
Interesting.

10:00.379 --> 10:02.048
Joey's bare ass.

10:06.135 --> 10:07.219
Well played.

10:13.601 --> 10:16.604
- I love you, Phoebe.
- I love you too.

10:19.190 --> 10:20.524
Please...

10:20.691 --> 10:22.026
Please don't...

10:22.193 --> 10:25.780
Don't turn into, you know,
a French bitch.

10:26.447 --> 10:28.115
I won't.

10:29.867 --> 10:32.828
All right. Well, if I'm gonna do this,
I better keep going.

10:32.995 --> 10:34.330
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:34.497 --> 10:35.831
- Monica?
- Yeah?

10:35.998 --> 10:38.959
- Will you come with me?
- Sure.

10:40.503 --> 10:42.963
- Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
- No.

10:43.130 --> 10:45.174
Oh, you're so screwed.

10:50.596 --> 10:51.972
H93'-

10:52.139 --> 10:53.474
What was that all about?

10:53.933 --> 10:57.144
She's gonna say goodbye
to each of us individually.

10:57.853 --> 10:59.939
Are you kidding? Oh, my God.

11:00.106 --> 11:03.651
Yeah, I know.
It's gonna be even worse for you. God.

11:03.818 --> 11:06.445
Well, just get ready
to do some serious crying.

11:07.029 --> 11:10.032
Man, I'm not gonna be able
to handle this.

11:11.117 --> 11:15.162
Now I know how my students feel
at the end of each year.

11:16.122 --> 11:20.835
And why they act out
by giving me such bad evaluations.

11:24.672 --> 11:26.882
Mon. Okay.

11:27.049 --> 11:31.345
I better just say what it is
I'm gonna say.

11:34.223 --> 11:39.186
None of the amazing things that have
happened to me in the last 10 years...

11:39.353 --> 11:41.647
...would have happened
if it wasn't for you.

11:43.899 --> 11:48.362
No one has been
more like a sister to me.

11:48.779 --> 11:50.614
I know what you mean.

11:50.781 --> 11:52.533
You're like a sister to me too.

11:58.164 --> 12:01.876
I don't know what
I'm going to do without you.

12:03.460 --> 12:06.213
You're the greatest friend I ever had.

12:06.714 --> 12:10.217
...Seeing you every day.

12:11.594 --> 12:13.262
What?

12:16.765 --> 12:20.352
...See you every day!

12:20.686 --> 12:22.938
That is so sweet!

12:29.486 --> 12:31.655
Oh, no, she took down Monica.

12:33.324 --> 12:35.701
And I'm the crier in the family.

12:37.411 --> 12:39.246
Oh, God, I could be next.

12:39.580 --> 12:42.416
Maybe she won't talk to me if it
looks like we're in conversation.

12:42.583 --> 12:45.461
- Okay.
- That thing you said about the thing...

12:45.628 --> 12:48.130
...it really made me think
about that other thing.

12:48.297 --> 12:51.050
- Rash?
- Oh, it's okay, Chandler's talking to her.

12:51.217 --> 12:53.594
I really made you think
about that thing, huh?

12:57.973 --> 13:02.186
Uh, Rach, I think I have something
that belongs to you.

13:06.065 --> 13:11.612
Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending
to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.

13:12.947 --> 13:16.492
No, no, they're really yours.
We found them in your old room.

13:16.659 --> 13:19.411
Well, these aren't mine.
Maybe Monica used to use them with...

13:19.578 --> 13:21.163
Don't say Richard.

13:22.957 --> 13:26.460
Well, if they're not Monica's and
they're not yours, then whose are they?

13:26.627 --> 13:29.922
I think you're forgetting the kinkiest
former resident of that room.

13:30.464 --> 13:32.800
- Pheebs!
- Yeah!

13:34.969 --> 13:36.595
I think these are yours.

13:37.680 --> 13:42.101
These are not mine.
Look how flimsy they are. Come on.

13:43.811 --> 13:47.147
My God, you try to hang a guy
from a water pipe with these...

13:47.314 --> 13:50.401
...they'll snap like a piece of licorice.

13:51.485 --> 13:54.280
- Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
- Sure.

13:57.491 --> 14:01.161
You don't really handcuff guys
to water pipes do you?

14:01.328 --> 14:04.081
Where do you think Mike really is?

14:13.132 --> 14:14.466
Oh, honey...

14:14.633 --> 14:17.594
Let me just saying something
because once we get into this...

14:17.761 --> 14:21.682
...I'm gonna get all uncomfortable
and probably make some stupid joke.

14:23.809 --> 14:26.645
I just want to say that I... I love you.

14:28.522 --> 14:31.108
And I'm gonna miss you.

14:31.859 --> 14:34.486
And I'm so sad that you're leaving.

14:37.072 --> 14:39.241
Oh, you know what?

14:40.367 --> 14:42.745
Let's not say anything else.

14:42.911 --> 14:44.621
I love you.

14:46.290 --> 14:47.333
Not so tight.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.589
- I'm sorry, give me one more chance.
- Okay.

14:53.756 --> 14:55.424
Okay.

14:57.384 --> 14:59.887
- Oh!
- I'm sorry. Just go. Just go.

15:00.054 --> 15:01.972
I can't. I can't.

15:07.394 --> 15:10.314
- So I guess you're next. You ready?
- I don't think so.

15:10.481 --> 15:14.151
Oh, you're definitely not.
I haven't cried like that in years.

15:14.318 --> 15:16.612
You cried yesterday at the 6:00 news.

15:16.779 --> 15:20.157
That old woman was being scammed
by her mechanic.

15:21.617 --> 15:24.787
God, I can't believe
she saved me for last.

15:24.953 --> 15:26.705
Why are they taking so long?

15:26.872 --> 15:27.998
I don't know.

15:28.165 --> 15:31.460
But, God, Joey seems to be handling
it surprisingly well.

15:34.963 --> 15:37.132
No!

15:44.890 --> 15:47.226
Okay, here we go.

15:50.437 --> 15:53.190
- Well...
- Yeah.

15:54.108 --> 15:56.360
I think I'm gonna take off.

15:59.655 --> 16:00.697
Huh?

16:00.864 --> 16:05.077
Oh, you guys, this was an amazing night.
Thank you so much.

16:05.244 --> 16:06.870
I love you.

16:07.037 --> 16:08.705
Good night.

16:12.751 --> 16:14.420
What?

16:17.464 --> 16:19.842
I don't get a goodbye?

16:20.008 --> 16:21.927
Lucky bastard.

16:29.518 --> 16:32.896
Unbelievable.
She says goodbye to everyone but me!

16:33.063 --> 16:36.442
Well, maybe she thought that
with all of your history, it could be...

16:36.608 --> 16:40.863
- ...you know, implicit.
- Well, it needs to be "plicit."

16:41.029 --> 16:44.616
All right, let's think about this.
I mean, there's gotta be an explanation.

16:44.783 --> 16:48.787
- Did you do anything to make her mad?
- No, I don't think so.

16:48.954 --> 16:52.583
You know, maybe she was just
really spent from our talk.

16:52.749 --> 16:54.668
- It was pretty intense.
- Yeah, mine too.

16:54.835 --> 16:56.879
- Mine was a humdinger.
- Okay!

16:58.589 --> 17:03.969
I mean, don't I deserve anything?
I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?

17:06.096 --> 17:08.473
Not from you!

17:09.599 --> 17:12.478
Ross, if you're this upset,
you should go and talk to her.

17:12.644 --> 17:15.105
And say what? You owe me a goodbye?

17:15.271 --> 17:18.692
- I mean, he's got more pride than that.
- The hell I do!

17:22.654 --> 17:25.031
- I don't get a goodbye?
- What?

17:25.199 --> 17:29.495
Everyone gets a goodbye but me?
What do I gotta do to get a goodbye?

17:29.661 --> 17:32.748
Huh? Be best friends with you?
Go out with you?

17:32.915 --> 17:34.333
Have a baby with you?

17:34.500 --> 17:37.044
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute!
I did all those things!

17:38.295 --> 17:40.422
- Ross...
- Or maybe I'm just not giving you...

17:40.589 --> 17:45.260
...enough credit. Uh, I mean, it is difficult
to say goodbye to five people.

17:45.427 --> 17:48.305
Goodbye, goodbye,
goodbye, goodbye, g...

17:48.472 --> 17:50.307
It's physically impossible!

17:53.477 --> 17:55.896
You know what?
After all we've been through...

17:56.063 --> 17:59.316
...I can't believe this is how
you want to leave things between us.

17:59.483 --> 18:01.777
Have a good time in Paris.

18:06.865 --> 18:10.077
- I hope Ross isn't too upset.
- I'm sure he's not more bummed out...

18:10.244 --> 18:12.246
- ...than I am.
- Tell me about it.

18:12.412 --> 18:15.332
Well, you can't say we don't know
how to throw a party.

18:16.291 --> 18:18.293
I think I'm gonna head out.

18:18.752 --> 18:23.048
- Uh, where do you think you're going?
- I thought I was going home to bed...

18:23.215 --> 18:26.260
...but I'm sensing there's something
less fun for me to do here.

18:27.386 --> 18:30.180
We're moving in a couple days
and we got a lot of packing to do.

18:30.347 --> 18:34.476
- It'd be great if you guys could pitch in.
- Joey and I can finish up the guest room.

18:34.643 --> 18:36.395
Yeah, good idea.

18:37.688 --> 18:40.107
Oh, no. You and Phoebe
are gonna help me in here.

18:41.567 --> 18:43.151
You couldn't be cool.

18:44.778 --> 18:46.446
We're gonna start in the kitchen.

18:46.613 --> 18:49.658
Plates get put into plate protectors
and stacked 10 to a box.

18:49.825 --> 18:53.787
The silverware gets bundled in rubber
bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?

18:53.954 --> 18:55.872
- Yeah.
- Good. I need you to be careful...

18:56.039 --> 18:58.709
...and efficient. And remember,
if I'm harsh with you...

18:58.875 --> 19:01.712
...it is only because
you're doing it wrong.

19:03.839 --> 19:06.842
Hey, Mon, I think I figured out
whose handcuffs they are.

19:07.009 --> 19:09.720
- You did? How?
- Well, I was cleaning out the closet...

19:09.886 --> 19:12.264
...and I found some pictures of them...

19:12.431 --> 19:16.351
- ...being used.
- Oh, my God, let me see.

19:18.186 --> 19:19.479
Who's that dirty old lady?

19:21.064 --> 19:22.482
Monica's grandmother.

19:23.984 --> 19:27.613
Oh, my God. Nana liked it rough!

19:29.197 --> 19:30.907
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:31.074 --> 19:32.451
Here, have a seat. Yeah.

19:32.618 --> 19:34.578
- How was your night?
- Oh, it was okay.

19:34.745 --> 19:37.497
I went to a movie with my cousin
then out for dinner.

19:37.664 --> 19:39.625
We went to this place that had...

19:45.422 --> 19:49.009
Anyway, they had these
really amazing cheeseburgers.

19:51.803 --> 19:55.057
- Erica, are you okay?
- Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.

19:55.223 --> 19:59.936
I keep getting these stomachaches.
They come and go every few minutes.

20:01.730 --> 20:06.151
- Oh, my God.
- Relax, we'll just get her some antacids.

20:06.693 --> 20:09.196
She doesn't have a stomachache!
She's in labor!

20:09.363 --> 20:11.823
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, you gotta get to the hospital!

20:11.990 --> 20:15.952
Chandler, get the coats! Erica, let's go!
Phoebe and Joey, keep packing!

20:16.119 --> 20:18.664
Oh, my God, we're gonna have a baby.

20:19.414 --> 20:21.208
We're gonna have a baby!

20:21.375 --> 20:23.460
Oh, my God, we're gonna have a baby!

20:23.627 --> 20:26.838
Oh, God, I've gotta sit down!
I've gotta sit down!

20:28.548 --> 20:32.094
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.
- You can do this. Just breathe.

20:32.511 --> 20:35.305
Okay. Okay.

20:35.472 --> 20:36.890
Okay, I feel a little better.

20:37.057 --> 20:40.018
Oh! Are you sure?

20:41.311 --> 20:43.897
- Yes, I'm sure. Oh, honey, let's go.
- Okay.

20:44.064 --> 20:45.774
- Come, let's go.
- Bye!

20:45.941 --> 20:47.818
- We're having a baby!
- Good luck!

20:47.984 --> 20:49.778
- Chandler, wait, wait, wait!
- What?

20:49.945 --> 20:53.448
If you get a second, find out
where she got that cheeseburger.

21:00.997 --> 21:03.959
You think I didn't say goodbye
to you because I don't care?

21:04.126 --> 21:05.669
That's what it seemed like.

21:05.836 --> 21:10.549
I cannot believe that after 10 years
you do not know one thing about me!

21:10.716 --> 21:16.012
- Then why didn't you say something?
- Because it is too damn hard, Ross!

21:16.179 --> 21:20.809
I can't even begin to explain to you
how much I am gonna miss you.

21:21.435 --> 21:25.647
When I think about not seeing you
every day, it makes me not want to go.

21:26.690 --> 21:29.609
Okay? So if you think that
I didn't say goodbye to you...

21:29.776 --> 21:33.572
...because you don't mean as much
to me as everybody else, you're wrong.

21:33.739 --> 21:36.491
It's because you mean more to me.

21:36.658 --> 21:39.119
So there, all right?
There's your goodbye!

21:39.578 --> 21:40.996
- Rash!
- What?

21:41.163 --> 21:43.373
- You keep... You can't...
- What?

22:05.771 --> 22:07.981
- A little more.
- Okay.

22:08.815 --> 22:11.318
- A little more. A little more.
- All right.

22:12.652 --> 22:14.905
Little more.

22:17.073 --> 22:19.743
- All right. All right, let's do this.
- All right, ready?

22:19.910 --> 22:22.496
Yep. Now give me your best shot.

22:23.288 --> 22:25.582
All right. Here goes.

22:30.796 --> 22:33.006
Doesn't work.
