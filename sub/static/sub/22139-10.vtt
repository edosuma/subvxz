WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:03.337
JESSICA: It was Christmas time
once again

00:03.437 --> 00:05.739
for the people
of Jessica Town.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.576
The tree was felled
and trimmed.

00:08.676 --> 00:12.946
The widow Koko was baking
her famous gingerbread cookies.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.683
Even the village playhouse
was --

00:15.783 --> 00:18.119
"Titanic"?!

00:18.219 --> 00:19.453
Oh, uh, sorry.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.455
I just can't wait for
"Titanic" to come out.

00:21.555 --> 00:22.890
I've been a big Leo fan
ever since

00:22.990 --> 00:24.192
"What's Eating
Gilbert Grape."

00:24.292 --> 00:26.127
I really believed
he was a --

00:26.227 --> 00:27.961
anyway,
he was really good.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.597
EVAN: You should turn
that extra train station

00:29.697 --> 00:31.865
into an orphanage.

00:31.965 --> 00:33.634
Why would
I need an orphanage?

00:33.734 --> 00:36.437
There are no unwanted children
in Jessica Town.

00:36.537 --> 00:37.971
Thanks to my steady hand

00:38.072 --> 00:40.774
and harsh, but fair,
management style,

00:40.874 --> 00:42.476
everything is perfect.

00:42.576 --> 00:43.944
If only
it were this easy

00:44.044 --> 00:46.914
to whip a real neighborhood
into shape for Christmas.

00:47.014 --> 00:48.249
(all shouting)

00:48.349 --> 00:50.718
Order! Order! Order!

00:51.252 --> 00:52.953
Tensions run high
this time of year,

00:53.053 --> 00:54.122
but that's why the HOA

00:54.222 --> 00:56.657
elected a Christmas committee
chairperson.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.893
Jessica Huang,
the floor is yours.

01:01.995 --> 01:04.932
Lisa, I count 14 plastic
reindeer on your roof,

01:05.032 --> 01:06.167
including three Rudolph.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.401
Lose some deer.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.737
Amanda, you bring store-bought
to a cookie swap,

01:09.837 --> 01:11.004
you go home empty-handed.

01:11.105 --> 01:12.106
How could you even tell?

01:12.206 --> 01:14.142
I can taste the laziness.
We all can.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.676
Deidre,
jolly up your eggnog.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.112
No one should have
to drink a quart of cream

01:18.212 --> 01:19.012
to get a buzz.

01:19.113 --> 01:20.614
What night
is caroling?

01:20.714 --> 01:21.982
You really
want to carol again?

01:22.082 --> 01:23.351
Remember what happened
last year?

01:23.451 --> 01:26.820
(off-key) * A partridge
in a pear tree *

01:26.920 --> 01:29.323
* On the second day
of Christmas *
* When I'm singing up here,
you all should sing *

01:29.423 --> 01:32.092
* My true love
gave to me *
(deeper voice)
* Down here

01:32.193 --> 01:35.129
Christmas is not the time
for mediocrity.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.331
Oh, actually,
I have some great news.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.467
My college roommate's marriage
is disintegrating,

01:39.567 --> 01:41.969
so Holly's gonna stay with us
this Christmas.

01:42.069 --> 01:43.837
She teaches
performance and movement

01:43.937 --> 01:44.972
at an art school,

01:45.072 --> 01:45.973
and she's offered

01:46.073 --> 01:47.508
to direct the caroling
this year.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.642
(all murmur)

01:48.742 --> 01:51.479
Wow, good luck to Holly.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.347
Maybe she can make
some figgy pudding

01:53.447 --> 01:55.516
out of a bunch
of rotten figs!

01:56.450 --> 01:59.653
What I'm saying
is that you're all real bad.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.689
**

02:01.789 --> 02:02.890
* Fresh off the boat

02:02.990 --> 02:04.525
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

02:04.625 --> 02:06.694
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

02:06.794 --> 02:08.128
* Fresh off the boat

02:08.229 --> 02:10.698
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

02:10.798 --> 02:11.965
* But I know where I'm goin'

02:12.065 --> 02:14.735
* I'm fresh off the boat

02:16.404 --> 02:18.005
**

02:18.105 --> 02:19.173
Guess who booked passage

02:19.273 --> 02:21.809
on the White Star Line's
ill-fated maiden voyage?

02:21.909 --> 02:23.511
All aboard!
(imitates foghorn)

02:23.611 --> 02:24.712
(chuckles)

02:26.013 --> 02:27.848
I got tickets
to the "Titanic" premiere!

02:27.948 --> 02:28.716
Who's in?

02:28.816 --> 02:30.318
Another period drama?

02:30.418 --> 02:32.052
Remember how hard
you tried to sell me

02:32.152 --> 02:33.321
on "Remains of the Day"?

02:33.421 --> 02:35.022
No, thanks.

02:35.122 --> 02:36.257
Sorry, Dad.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.325
I'm reading a book
about the Titanic now

02:37.425 --> 02:39.193
and don't want
to spoil the ending.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.397
I can't. I'm meeting
Nicole for coffee.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.999
I'm thinking of
getting mine...iced.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.601
Boys, this is an event.

02:47.701 --> 02:51.205
Missing "Titanic"
would be unthinkable.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.106
**

02:53.207 --> 02:54.074
(sighs)

02:54.174 --> 02:55.209
Ma, do you
want to see a movie?

02:55.309 --> 02:56.444
A lot of people die.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.079
3 hours and 14 minutes.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.950
(laughs)

03:03.050 --> 03:05.553
Ah, is that your
Lao Ban Santa costume?

03:05.653 --> 03:07.388
It's your Christmas
tradition.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.961
So, any interest
in seeing "Titanic"?

03:14.061 --> 03:15.463
You do love
others' misfortune.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.898
Eh, if I wanted to watch
white people sink a boat,

03:17.998 --> 03:19.300
I'd watch
"Gilligan's Island."

03:19.400 --> 03:22.470
Besides, I have my own disaster
to deal with.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.238
Oh, come on.
Your hair looks great.

03:24.338 --> 03:26.374
I was talking about
caroling.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.041
Oh.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.811
* Eight maids a milking

03:30.911 --> 03:32.112
* Seven swans a swimming

03:32.212 --> 03:33.747
* Six geese a laying

03:33.847 --> 03:37.651
* Five golden rings

03:37.751 --> 03:39.086
* Four calling birds

03:39.186 --> 03:40.421
* Three French hens

03:40.521 --> 03:41.889
* Two turtle doves

03:41.989 --> 03:47.261
* And a partridge
in a pear *

03:47.361 --> 03:51.131
* Tree

03:51.565 --> 03:52.966
HOLLY: Great job!

03:53.066 --> 03:56.804
Guys, you put me down on "pear"
instead of "tree."

03:56.904 --> 03:58.772
But, hey,
that's why we rehearse.

03:58.872 --> 03:59.940
Holly.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.909
Jessica Huang --
HOA Christmas chair.

04:02.009 --> 04:02.843
That was amazing.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.646
It's fun!
So much positive energy.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.947
Unlike my marriage.

04:07.047 --> 04:07.848
Mm.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.249
So, I was thinking
this year,

04:09.350 --> 04:10.584
we would sing
at every house

04:10.684 --> 04:13.321
and then end with a grand finale
in the cul-de-sac.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.489
I thought you didn't
want to carol.
I didn't,

04:15.589 --> 04:18.091
until you flew in
the Puerto Rican
Maria von Trapp.

04:18.191 --> 04:19.627
A-Actually,
my mom's Canadian,

04:19.727 --> 04:21.295
and my father's
Syrian-Jewish,

04:21.395 --> 04:23.096
but raised in Brazil.
Mm.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.298
Or maybe
you're from Heaven,

04:24.398 --> 04:26.099
because this is
a Christmas miracle.

04:26.199 --> 04:27.835
Aw, it's nothing.

04:27.935 --> 04:28.836
The only challenge is,

04:28.936 --> 04:30.304
is working with
so many people.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.039
So thin the herd.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.140
Hold auditions

04:33.240 --> 04:34.808
and cut the people
who are not worthy.

04:34.908 --> 04:35.943
Like her.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.778
**

04:37.878 --> 04:38.812
No, no!

04:38.912 --> 04:40.348
We can make it work
with everyone.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.849
Come on,
it's supposed to be fun.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.852
It is a visual burden
for people who open doors

04:44.952 --> 04:46.854
to see more than
six singers.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.822
I don't think
that's true.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.524
Make the cuts, Holly.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.560
Snip-snip, Lisa.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.195
**

04:55.295 --> 04:56.664
(indistinct conversations)

04:56.764 --> 04:57.865
(imitates foghorn)

04:57.965 --> 04:59.800
Keep it moving, lady!

05:00.534 --> 05:01.469
Louis?

05:01.569 --> 05:02.503
Honey.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.338
Uh, sorry about
the foghorn sound.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.506
I just excited for Leo.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.540
Oh. (laughs)

05:06.640 --> 05:09.009
Is Marvin here?
No, he's not.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.178
And would you mind
not telling him you saw me?

05:11.278 --> 05:12.179
I promised I'd wait

05:12.279 --> 05:13.547
till "Titanic"
comes out on video

05:13.647 --> 05:15.248
so we can watch it together
at home.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.584
He won't see it
in the theater?

05:16.684 --> 05:18.519
He was in the Navy,
and he's really worried

05:18.619 --> 05:20.488
about watching a ship
go down in public.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.322
I hate
going behind his back,

05:22.423 --> 05:23.857
but I just couldn't wait.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.059
I mean, missing "Titanic"
would be

05:26.159 --> 05:27.561
unthinkable!
Unthinkable!

05:27.661 --> 05:28.929
Oh!
Ah!

05:29.029 --> 05:30.230
(both laugh)

05:30.330 --> 05:31.499
Don't worry.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.834
Unlike the supposedly
water-tight compartments

05:33.934 --> 05:35.235
inside Titanic's hull,

05:35.335 --> 05:36.404
my lips are sealed.

05:36.504 --> 05:37.571
(chuckles)

05:38.872 --> 05:40.674
(mid-tempo music plays)

05:40.774 --> 05:42.710
Why'd you pick
this place?

05:42.810 --> 05:45.379
It's way outside
my preferred bike radius.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.014
What?
They have great coffee.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.850
The beans are, like,
extra roasted or whatever.

05:49.950 --> 05:50.884
Also...

05:50.984 --> 05:53.086
Jackie.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.087
Who Jackie?

05:54.187 --> 05:55.088
(thumping)

05:55.188 --> 05:57.891
(grunts)
Blend, you piece of crap!

05:57.991 --> 05:59.793
She doesn't take any guff
from machines.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.429
Cute, right?

06:01.529 --> 06:03.464
I've been coming here
every day for two weeks,

06:03.564 --> 06:05.799
and yesterday,

06:05.899 --> 06:07.601
she started doing this.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.238
* Yeah
A smiley.

06:12.305 --> 06:13.607
I knew this day
would come.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.975
You need my help
with a girl.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.309
So, what do I do?

06:16.410 --> 06:17.645
Uh, should I go say hi?

06:17.745 --> 06:19.079
Nah,
that'll seem desperate.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.549
Just sit here and give off
casual, confident vibes.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.651
You know,
laugh a little,

06:23.751 --> 06:25.786
but not too much because
she'll think we're together.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.255
(laughs)

06:28.355 --> 06:30.290
Yeah, see?
That's too much.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.159
If you want to sit,
you have to order a drink.

06:32.259 --> 06:33.126
Store policy.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.595
Spot me some cash?

06:34.695 --> 06:36.329
Sorry. I'm broke.

06:37.330 --> 06:40.434
So, I hear Cupid
dipped his arrow in coffee

06:40.534 --> 06:42.636
and struck someone
square in the ol' pumper.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.138
Yeah, yeah.
You bring your wallet?

06:45.238 --> 06:47.641
EVAN: * I really
need you tonight *

06:47.741 --> 06:51.645
* Forever's
gonna start tonight *

06:51.745 --> 06:53.914
* Forever's
gonna start to *

06:54.014 --> 06:57.284
* Once upon a time,
I was falling in love *

06:57.384 --> 07:00.488
* Now I'm only falling apart

07:02.756 --> 07:04.625
* There's nothing I can do

07:04.725 --> 07:08.361
* A total eclipse
of the heart *

07:08.462 --> 07:12.600
(applause)

07:13.701 --> 07:15.969
Bonnie Tyler
takes it out of me!

07:16.069 --> 07:18.371
Next --
uh, Jessica Huang.

07:20.007 --> 07:20.941
(sighs)

07:21.041 --> 07:22.643
Get ready to feel.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.044
I didn't bring any Kleenex,

07:24.144 --> 07:25.713
so when the tears come,

07:25.813 --> 07:27.981
just use your sleeves.

07:32.385 --> 07:35.689
(plays "My Heart Will Go On"
on recorder)

07:43.130 --> 07:47.300
* Every night in my dreams

07:47.400 --> 07:52.673
* I see you, I feel you

07:52.773 --> 07:57.578
* That is how I know you

07:57.678 --> 08:00.247
* Go on

08:00.814 --> 08:04.752
* Near, far

08:04.885 --> 08:09.089
* Wherever you are

08:09.189 --> 08:15.062
* I believe that
the heart does *

08:15.162 --> 08:18.899
* Go on

08:18.999 --> 08:20.601
**

08:20.701 --> 08:24.738
* We'll stay

08:24.838 --> 08:29.009
* Forever this way

08:29.109 --> 08:33.380
* You are safe in my heart

08:33.480 --> 08:37.050
* And my heart will

08:37.150 --> 08:43.356
* Go on and on

08:43.456 --> 08:46.594
**

08:46.694 --> 08:49.362
Merry Christmas to all.

08:49.462 --> 08:51.531
All right, let me first
start off by saying

08:51.632 --> 08:52.600
you all were so great.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.934
I really wish the human eye

08:54.034 --> 08:56.469
could process more than
six people in a door frame,

08:56.570 --> 08:58.471
but apparently it can't.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.542
(all murmuring)
JESSICA: Ah.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.444
Ah!
Evan you made it!

09:05.545 --> 09:07.380
Vocal rest. Respect.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.451
There must be
some mistake.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.220
My name's
not on the list.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.088
I'm sorry.
You didn't make the cut.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.124
**

09:18.592 --> 09:22.896
I didn't make the cut?
But I hit three octaves!

09:22.996 --> 09:25.265
Did you hear me
ascend the ladder?

09:25.365 --> 09:27.968
I climbed up over Celine.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.738
I stepped on the shoulders
of that French-Canadian angel,

09:30.838 --> 09:31.805
and I kissed the heavens!

09:31.905 --> 09:34.507
Jessica,
you're a wonderful singer.

09:34.608 --> 09:37.177
It's just that
you're lacking a little...

09:37.277 --> 09:38.478
Christmas spirit.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.480
Christmas spirit?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.816
I've seen how you treat
your sister carolers.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.352
You kept yelling "No"
during Amanda's audition,

09:45.452 --> 09:47.120
you slept through Lisa's,

09:47.220 --> 09:48.588
and pretended
to hang yourself

09:48.689 --> 09:49.957
while Deidre was singing.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.693
I was kidding.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.462
Hey, doesn't anyone
like to laugh anymore?

09:55.562 --> 09:58.999
That kind of negative energy
is toxic in a group.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.101
Just look what happened
to Oasis!

10:01.201 --> 10:05.005
**

10:05.105 --> 10:06.874
So, they're steaming
across the North Atlantic,

10:06.974 --> 10:08.876
everything's
going great --
MARVIN: Louis.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.611
Hey, Marvin!
What brings you by?

10:11.712 --> 10:13.313
So, I'm hiding
Honey's Christmas gift,

10:13.413 --> 10:15.048
which is something
we do every year --

10:15.148 --> 10:16.149
You know, it preserves

10:16.249 --> 10:17.885
the magic and the wonder
of the season --

10:17.985 --> 10:20.353
when I find
this ticket stub...

10:20.453 --> 10:22.355
for a major
motion picture.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.456
Oh.

10:23.556 --> 10:24.725
Now, I know
it couldn't be Nicole

10:24.825 --> 10:26.026
because she was
at a coffee shop.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.561
And Honey told me that
she went to the gym,

10:28.662 --> 10:30.197
but I found this...

10:30.297 --> 10:32.833
in her purse --
Goobers.

10:32.933 --> 10:36.670
Honey hates the combo
of chocolate and peanuts.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.505
That means
she went to the movie

10:38.605 --> 10:41.174
with somebody
who was eating these!

10:41.274 --> 10:43.877
Hmm, hmm,
sounds like a dead end.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.846
No, there's something
going on, Lou.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.015
She's been acting
very strangely lately.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.517
I need to stake out
some movie theaters,

10:50.617 --> 10:51.985
get to the bottom
of this.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.854
Or...don't.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.991
Nah, I gotta
go do this thing.

10:58.391 --> 11:01.361
**

11:03.063 --> 11:04.397
Coffee is great!

11:04.497 --> 11:05.532
I feel like
the show "Friends"

11:05.632 --> 11:06.566
makes
a lot more sense now.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.068
I am super focused.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.770
I've read three articles
about hockey.

11:09.870 --> 11:10.838
Hockey!

11:10.938 --> 11:11.772
Cupdate!

11:11.872 --> 11:13.340
Look what Jackie wrote.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.042
A heart over the "I"?!

11:15.142 --> 11:17.044
(grunts)

11:17.144 --> 11:18.545
I knew playing "hard to get"
would pay off!

11:18.645 --> 11:20.247
So what's my next move?
I don't know!

11:20.347 --> 11:22.449
Well, how did you first
connect with Alison?

11:23.951 --> 11:25.385
We met playing piccolo.

11:25.485 --> 11:28.355
Oh, right! I knew
it was doing something.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.758
**

11:30.858 --> 11:34.261
How can Holly say I don't
have Christmas spirit?

11:34.361 --> 11:36.096
Of course,
you have spirit, Mommy.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.431
Everyone knows
how much you love Christmas.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.599
Holly just met you.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.268
She hasn't had a chance
to see that.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.871
Well,
I'm off to rehearsal.

11:43.971 --> 11:47.140
Holly's going to fine tune
my step and twists.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.113
As if she could.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.118
So, Marvin came by
to tell me

11:58.218 --> 12:01.121
he found your ticket stub
and a box of Goobers.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.756
He thinks
you've been acting strange

12:02.856 --> 12:04.491
so he's staking out
movie theaters.

12:04.591 --> 12:05.725
Ugh.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.895
He always makes some excuse
to stage a stakeout.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.496
I think he just likes
eating in his car.

12:09.596 --> 12:12.099
He did order a couple quarts
of scalloped potatoes to go.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.633
I feel kind of bad.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.402
Maybe we should just tell him
we saw "Titanic."

12:15.502 --> 12:17.805
I'll tell him after I give him
his Christmas gift.

12:17.905 --> 12:18.906
I don't want to upset him.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.640
Like in "Titanic"
when Billy Zane

12:20.740 --> 12:22.575
finds the nude sketch
Jack drew of Rose.

12:22.675 --> 12:25.445
I must've missed that scene
when I was in the restroom.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.014
Well,
it was a great scene.
Oh...

12:27.114 --> 12:28.248
They were all great.
I know.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.683
I have to admit, I can't
stop thinking about it.

12:30.784 --> 12:31.584
Me neither.

12:31.684 --> 12:35.823
("My Heart Will Go On" plays)

12:35.923 --> 12:37.791
We can't go see it again.
No way. No.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.626
I mean, not with Marvin
staking out the theaters.

12:39.726 --> 12:40.961
Yeah. (laughs)

12:42.162 --> 12:43.363
(sighs)

12:43.463 --> 12:45.498
**

12:45.598 --> 12:48.802
Perfect.
No one will notice us.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.438
**

12:51.538 --> 12:54.307
Whoo!
(rolls tongue)

12:54.407 --> 12:55.342
Oh, wow.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.676
I know what you need
to do, Nicole.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.678
So, every couple has
a special love language, right?

12:58.778 --> 13:01.514
Right. For Eddie and Alison,
that language was woodwinds.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.850
(imitates flute playing)

13:02.950 --> 13:06.119
For Nicole and Jackie,
that language is coffee cups.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.354
Here's Alison's cup.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.122
No smiley face in her "O,"
No heart atop her "I."

13:09.222 --> 13:10.523
You want to communicate
with Jackie?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.292
You speak through these.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.626
My boy done
cracked this thing!

13:13.726 --> 13:14.694
I'm gonna go grab
some coffee cups

13:14.794 --> 13:16.729
so we can workshop
the perfect message.

13:17.831 --> 13:18.798
Do you really need
a move?

13:18.899 --> 13:20.500
Why not just go up
and say "Hi"?

13:20.600 --> 13:22.002
(laughs)
Alison, please.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.037
When Nicole needs
help dumping her,
we'll come to you.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.738
Whoa. I don't know
why I said that.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.374
Sorry.
That was the java talking.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.309
It's fine.
I've never been happier.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.979
**

13:32.079 --> 13:33.213
It's crazy, I know,

13:33.313 --> 13:35.215
but I thought maybe
they wouldn't sink this time.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.183
Well, you did your part

13:36.283 --> 13:37.885
by yelling "iceberg"
at the screen.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.586
MARVIN: Honey?

13:40.053 --> 13:41.354
I'd been
to five theaters

13:41.454 --> 13:43.023
and starting to think
I was crazy,

13:43.123 --> 13:44.057
but then, here you are,

13:44.157 --> 13:46.059
wearing your
"Little Orphan Annie" wig

13:46.159 --> 13:49.930
in the company of
some strange, old woman.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.999
Are you
the Goober queen?

13:54.101 --> 13:55.235
Louis?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.004
We just wanted
to see "Titanic."

13:57.104 --> 13:57.938
I'm sorry, sweetie.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.572
I know
I promised you I'd wait,

13:59.672 --> 14:01.041
but I couldn't
help myself.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.943
You mean you've been doing
all this sneaking around

14:03.043 --> 14:04.277
just to see
some silly boat movie?

14:04.377 --> 14:05.845
Yes.
It's more of a ship,
really.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.248
Must be
some kind of picture

14:08.348 --> 14:10.583
for you to go through all this
just to see it again.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.553
Oh. (chuckles)
It's an amazing movie.

14:13.653 --> 14:16.089
Maybe seeing
a boat go down in public

14:16.189 --> 14:18.926
won't be so bad
if my wife and my best friend

14:19.026 --> 14:20.127
are with me.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.094
(chuckles)

14:21.194 --> 14:23.263
Oh, we just missed
the 7:10.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.432
Oh, well, luckily,
it's playing again

14:25.532 --> 14:28.601
at 7:20, 7:40, 7:50,

14:28.701 --> 14:30.137
8:25, 8:55...

14:30.237 --> 14:33.606
**

14:33.706 --> 14:34.807
(sighs)

14:34.908 --> 14:36.276
Where the "H" is Holly?

14:36.376 --> 14:37.877
It's show time!

14:37.978 --> 14:39.746
JESSICA: Tidings!

14:39.846 --> 14:41.114
You all look so nice.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.615
We ready to do this?

14:42.715 --> 14:43.984
Uh, you didn't
make the cut.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.485
Does Holly
know you're here?

14:45.585 --> 14:46.753
Oh, I fired her.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.922
* Joy to the world

14:49.022 --> 14:50.757
* The Lord has come

14:50.857 --> 14:52.059
* Let Earth...

14:53.560 --> 14:57.597
* Repeat, repeat
the sounding joy *

14:57.697 --> 14:59.266
(claps)

14:59.366 --> 15:00.900
Bravo, Mrs. Huang.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.902
A very merry Christmas
to you.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.838
What do you mean
you fired Holly?

15:05.939 --> 15:07.140
I took your advice,

15:07.240 --> 15:09.276
and I went to go convince her
how much I love Christmas

15:09.376 --> 15:11.578
when I realized
I outrank her.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.814
Who is she to say
who can and can't sing?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.350
It's my committee,
and it's my Christmas.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.988
I can't believe you did that
to her on Christmas!

15:21.088 --> 15:22.522
I mean,
even her dirtbag husband

15:22.622 --> 15:23.790
had the decency
to run off

15:23.890 --> 15:25.625
the day
after her birthday.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.094
(scoffs)

15:28.261 --> 15:29.362
Evan, we don't need them.

15:29.462 --> 15:30.697
We can carol on our own.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.300
Sorry, but I don't feel like
singing with you.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.634
I guess I was wrong.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.336
You don't have
Christmas sprit.

15:36.436 --> 15:42.209
**

15:42.309 --> 15:44.677
I think you're being
too critical.

15:44.777 --> 15:45.845
You definitely are.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.480
I'm sorry,
but the nautical mistakes

15:47.580 --> 15:48.648
took me
right out of it.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.850
When a vessel that size
breaks apart,

15:50.950 --> 15:52.452
she makes
a hell of a lot more noise.

15:52.552 --> 15:53.553
Hell of a lot more.

15:53.653 --> 15:54.721
(doorbell rings)

15:54.821 --> 15:56.023
Mm. I'll get it.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.290
All right.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.792
JESSICA: * Hark how the bells,
sweet silver bells *

15:59.892 --> 16:01.794
* All seem to say,
throw cares away *

16:01.894 --> 16:03.796
* Christmas is here
bringing good cheer *

16:03.896 --> 16:05.832
* To young and old,
meek and the bold *

16:05.932 --> 16:07.834
* Ding, ding, ding, dong,
that is their song *

16:07.934 --> 16:09.836
* With joyful ring,
all caroling *

16:09.936 --> 16:12.172
I killed Christmas.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.174
But you love Christmas.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.708
Who else sends
everyone on the street

16:15.808 --> 16:17.010
her own ornament?

16:18.378 --> 16:21.348
Evan was so excited
about caroling,

16:21.448 --> 16:22.849
and I messed it up.

16:22.949 --> 16:24.684
I ruined Christmas
for my son.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.586
MARVIN:
Honey, look what I found

16:26.686 --> 16:28.555
in the garage
behind the absinthe.

16:28.655 --> 16:32.425
"To Big Daddy,
From Honey Poo"

16:32.525 --> 16:34.161
Marvin, let me --
Who's Big Daddy?

16:34.261 --> 16:36.863
You call me Boopsy,
Mr. Muffin, and Fish Stick.

16:36.963 --> 16:37.930
Never Big Daddy.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.866
I knew you were hiding
something.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.602
Open the gift.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.707
A satellite image
of a hurricane?

16:47.807 --> 16:49.542
Your sidecar
is a weatherman?

16:49.642 --> 16:51.010
It's a sonogram.

16:51.111 --> 16:54.547
**

16:54.647 --> 16:55.882
I'm pregnant.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.850
I'm Big Daddy?

16:57.950 --> 16:59.552
You will be.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.589
(both laugh)

17:02.689 --> 17:04.724
We're gonna have a baby,
Honey Poo!

17:04.824 --> 17:05.725
(laughter)

17:05.825 --> 17:08.027
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.462
Is this
my Lao Ban suit?

17:09.562 --> 17:10.797
Later, later.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.899
(laughs)

17:12.999 --> 17:13.966
This was supposed to be

17:14.067 --> 17:15.768
your Christmas gift,
Fish Stick.

17:15.868 --> 17:16.936
Yeah...

17:17.036 --> 17:18.438
I'm so happy for you!

17:18.538 --> 17:21.808
I've been dying
to tell you.

17:21.908 --> 17:22.875
So exciting!

17:22.975 --> 17:24.944
I'm not gonna lie,
I am really nervous,

17:25.044 --> 17:27.780
but I am so thankful
you'll be here to help me.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.450
Right, to help you ruin
Christmas for your baby.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.484
I'm great at that.

17:31.584 --> 17:32.952
Don't be
too hard on yourself.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.454
I know
you'll figure out a way

17:34.554 --> 17:36.089
to make things right
with Evan.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.924
You are a great mother.

17:38.024 --> 17:40.293
**

17:42.061 --> 17:44.764
[ mid-tempo music plays ]

17:44.864 --> 17:45.965
Nicole, we got it!

17:46.065 --> 17:48.067
This is the message
you should give to Jackie.

17:50.303 --> 17:53.640
"What up, girl,
you gay?

17:53.740 --> 17:56.143
You play
any instruments?

17:56.243 --> 17:57.510
Holla back at me."

17:57.610 --> 18:00.647
Confident, cool...
And a haiku.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.618
It's time.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.086
Take that cup
and give it to her.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.289
(inhales deeply)

18:10.690 --> 18:15.528
**

18:15.628 --> 18:16.696
Hi.

18:16.796 --> 18:17.997
Hey.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.799
Anything
I can help you with?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.135
Yeah.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.671
I have something
to give you.

18:24.771 --> 18:30.109
**

18:30.210 --> 18:31.678
My coffee order.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.013
No!
My words!

18:34.113 --> 18:35.848
(sighs) This must be
what it's like

18:35.948 --> 18:38.017
watching your kid
strikeout in baseball.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.553
**

18:40.653 --> 18:44.023
I wussed out
and ordered a coffee.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.294
No smiley face.

18:47.394 --> 18:48.228
No heart.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.362
I blew it, guys.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.663
Did you?

18:50.763 --> 18:52.632
(chuckles)
Turn the cup around!

18:54.033 --> 18:55.702
**

18:55.802 --> 18:56.969
Digits!
Yes!

18:57.069 --> 19:01.174
**

19:01.274 --> 19:02.575
EDDIE: We did it!

19:03.510 --> 19:05.478
(both laugh)

19:06.913 --> 19:08.315
(knocks on door)

19:08.415 --> 19:10.417
Evan.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.519
I made you something.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.058
Everyone should have a part
in celebrating Christmas,

19:19.158 --> 19:21.194
inside Jessica Town
and out.

19:21.294 --> 19:24.531
I'm sorry
I ruined caroling.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.233
I just love Christmas
so much,

19:26.333 --> 19:27.900
and I wanted it
to be perfect.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.769
Christmas isn't about
being perfect.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.771
It's about
everyone being together.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.105
Yes, it is.

19:33.206 --> 19:36.175
**

19:36.276 --> 19:38.010
I'm gonna put this
in Jessica Town

19:38.110 --> 19:39.879
next to Menthol Reds
National Forest

19:39.979 --> 19:41.848
where Grandma
hides her cigarettes.

19:41.948 --> 19:46.553
**

19:49.622 --> 19:51.424
Yeah,
Jessica'll do that to you.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.892
I once ate a pound
of gummy worms

19:52.992 --> 19:54.894
because she criticized
the way I walked --

19:54.994 --> 19:56.028
"Like a hooker?"

19:56.128 --> 19:57.564
Yeah, well,
you don't move that great.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.098
It might the shoes
you're wearing.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.600
(doorbell rings)

20:02.134 --> 20:03.470
JESSICA: Holly.

20:03.570 --> 20:06.239
I never should've
asked you to make cuts

20:06.339 --> 20:08.375
or fired you for making
such a dumb one.

20:08.475 --> 20:11.311
And we're lucky to have you
this Christmas.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.447
I know it's late...

20:14.547 --> 20:18.050
but would you join
the HOA carolers tonight?

20:18.150 --> 20:19.919
This time,
the whole herd?

20:20.019 --> 20:21.153
**

20:21.254 --> 20:22.422
You know,
I'm gonna do something

20:22.522 --> 20:24.424
my husband never could --

20:24.524 --> 20:26.626
admit I was wrong.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.061
You definitely have
the Christmas spirit, Jessica.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.963
Come here. Come here.
Aww!

20:32.332 --> 20:35.968
You should never admit
that you're wrong, okay?

20:36.068 --> 20:37.837
Never admit
that you're wrong.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.309
**

20:42.409 --> 20:44.977
(indistinct conversations)

20:45.077 --> 20:48.315
**

20:49.816 --> 20:52.452
* We wish you
a merry Christmas *

20:52.552 --> 20:54.621
* We wish you
a merry Christmas *

20:54.721 --> 20:57.189
* We wish you
a merry Christmas *

20:57.290 --> 20:59.292
* And a happy new year

20:59.392 --> 21:01.328
* Good tidings we bring

21:01.428 --> 21:03.796
* To you and your kin

21:03.896 --> 21:06.032
* Good tidings for Christmas

21:06.132 --> 21:08.368
* And a happy new year

21:08.468 --> 21:10.470
* We wish you
a merry Christmas *

21:10.570 --> 21:12.805
* We wish you
a merry Christmas *

21:12.905 --> 21:17.209
* We wish you
a merry Christmas *

21:17.310 --> 21:23.950
* And a happy new year

21:24.050 --> 21:26.519
