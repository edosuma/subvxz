WEBVTT

00:01.793 --> 00:03.754
- All right, who's ready
to have a good time, huh?

00:03.837 --> 00:05.923
That's right. That's what I like to hear.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.175
Uh, show of hands,
how many people have, uh,

00:08.258 --> 00:10.219
been to a taping of a TV show before?

00:10.302 --> 00:11.845
- Thank you. Okay.

00:11.929 --> 00:14.806
Just remember: "The movie's hilarious.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.225
Everyone buy tickets."

00:16.308 --> 00:17.643
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yeah.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.728
- Do you think I'm good in the movie?

00:19.811 --> 00:21.897
- Come on, Kev. I'm your agent.
Of course I think you're good

00:21.980 --> 00:23.941
in the movie. You know who else
thinks you're good in the movie?

00:24.024 --> 00:25.859
The studio.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.736
Now go knock 'em dead.
Big smiles, big laughs.

00:27.819 --> 00:30.322
America's funny man.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.491
- And, uh, we're gonna have a great time,
all right?

00:32.574 --> 00:33.909
- "America's funny man."

00:37.162 --> 00:39.831
- Oh, now, Kev, people are just raving

00:39.915 --> 00:42.876
about this new movie of yours.
- Oh, my God, they're raving.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.461
- You are working with

00:44.545 --> 00:46.463
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson,

00:46.547 --> 00:48.257
playing his comedy sidekick again.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.883
What is this, the sixth time now?

00:49.967 --> 00:51.051
- Number six.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.803
- How do you keep it so fresh?

00:52.886 --> 00:55.097
- I mean, look, Dwayne and I are, um...

00:55.180 --> 00:56.515
You know, we're friends.

00:56.598 --> 00:57.641
- #Jealous.
- Lucky.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.937
- He's lucky, too. He's lucky, too.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.730
But I mean, look, when you are friends,

01:03.814 --> 01:05.148
you feed off of each other.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.734
That energy, of course, transfers,
but, uh,

01:07.818 --> 01:09.820
I don't know, I would like to think of
my, my characters

01:09.903 --> 01:11.822
as, as heroes, as well.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.909
I-I don't know what the...

01:15.993 --> 01:17.744
I don't know why they laugh.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.371
I'm very serious.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.998
You know, I've-I've actually...
I've been...

01:21.081 --> 01:23.292
I've been trying to become
a leading man, you know?

01:23.375 --> 01:25.127
Do more of an action star thing.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.212
But I've been...
I've been somewhat typecast.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.131
For some reason,
people only see me as the funny guy.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.049
- You make me laugh.
- Yeah.
- No. Thank you. Glad...

01:31.133 --> 01:32.676
Glad, you know, appreciate it.
- I'm not an easy audience.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.180
- Yeah, you know, but it's just...
It's... I can do more

01:36.263 --> 01:40.267
than show up and do the funny
or do the dance. I'm...

01:40.350 --> 01:42.102
- Would you, though?
- Would you do that dance?

01:42.186 --> 01:43.228
- Come on.
- Come on.

01:43.312 --> 01:44.605
Who wants to see Kevin dance?

01:44.688 --> 01:46.190
Huh?

01:46.273 --> 01:47.816
- We'll get the Macarena going. Anybody?

01:47.900 --> 01:49.443
- We would love that.
- No.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.278
No.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.030
I'm not... I'm not gonna dance.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.199
- Next time. Next time, then, for sure.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.783
- Oh, dear.
- Uh, but getting back to the movie,

01:56.867 --> 01:58.660
t-tell-tell us
just how great this movie is.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.078
- The, uh, the movie's garbage.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.496
- Sorry.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.498
- Yeah. The movie's garbage.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.125
Take the movie, ball it up,

02:05.209 --> 02:06.543
throw it in the trash can.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.128
How many times do you need to see me

02:08.212 --> 02:10.881
in a car with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson,

02:10.964 --> 02:13.383
and I'm the comedy sidekick,
and he's saving lives,

02:13.467 --> 02:16.178
and I got a catchphrase: "Oh, hell no!"?

02:16.261 --> 02:17.429
- We love it when you say that.

02:17.513 --> 02:19.056
- Oh, yeah. Can you do it again?
- Yeah.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.849
- Here's my question:
why can't I be an action star?

02:20.933 --> 02:22.893
- I read something online

02:22.976 --> 02:24.686
a-about, uh, you being

02:24.770 --> 02:26.939
afraid of woodland creatures.
- Oh, yes.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.565
- About me what?
- A beaver?

02:28.649 --> 02:30.526
It was a s-squirrel. A squirrel.
- A squirrel. It was a squirrel.

02:30.609 --> 02:31.527
-Yes, that you have a fear of squirrels.

02:31.610 --> 02:32.736
- And who's afraid of a squirrel?

02:32.819 --> 02:34.071
- I'm not fucking afraid of a squirrel!

02:34.154 --> 02:35.948
- Okay.
- I'm not afraid of shit.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.241
- Okay, you've said it.
You've made your point there.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.243
- I'm not afraid of shit.
- Yeah.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.577
- And I'm more than just the guy
that does comedy.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.995
I'm a fucking action star, all right?

02:42.079 --> 02:43.622
So why don't you start taking me
a little serious?

02:43.705 --> 02:46.083
Tell me what I am and what I'm not.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.044
If I didn't have what the fuck it takes,
would I show this?

02:49.127 --> 02:52.214
Or that?

02:52.297 --> 02:53.632
Back up!
- Yup.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.217
- Whoa, Kev, Kev, Kev. Kev, hey.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.177
You got to go back out there,
say it was a joke.

02:57.261 --> 02:59.221
- Talking about "it was a joke"?
You don't get it, man.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.014
All right?
I'm trying to be taken seriously.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.350
My whole life,
I've dreamed of becoming an action hero.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.102
- Well, you know,
maybe instead of dreaming,

03:05.185 --> 03:06.854
you should just stay in your own lane.

03:06.937 --> 03:08.105
- What the fuck did you just say?

03:08.188 --> 03:09.648
- What are you doing?

03:15.279 --> 03:17.573
- It was a bit. We were doing a bit.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.078
- I'm not afraid of [bleep].
- Okay, you've said it.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.746
You've made your point there.
- I'm not afraid of [bleep].

03:24.830 --> 03:26.164
- Yeah.
- And I'm more than just

03:26.248 --> 03:27.666
the guy that does comedy.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.084
I'm a [bleep] action star, all right?

03:29.168 --> 03:30.335
So why don't you start [bleep]?

03:30.419 --> 03:32.462
- That was our star Kevin Hart,

03:32.546 --> 03:36.675
and apparently he's...
going through something.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.886
- To say the least.
You don't see Tom Cruise...

03:44.349 --> 03:46.101
- I already know what you're gonna say.

03:46.185 --> 03:48.020
You're gonna say, "Apologize,"
and then after that if I go...

03:48.103 --> 03:50.063
- No, no, no.
Kev, it's too late to apologize.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.149
The studio already removed you
from the fucking billboard.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.776
- So I'm done? Just like that, I'm done?

03:54.860 --> 03:56.195
- Maybe not.

03:56.278 --> 04:01.116
Claude Van De Velde wants
to meet with you.

04:03.452 --> 04:06.205
- Claude Van De Velde?
You're talking about the director?

04:06.288 --> 04:08.040
- Yes. Claude Van De Velde,

04:08.123 --> 04:10.083
director of four
of the six biggest action movies

04:10.167 --> 04:14.796
of all time,
saw the interview and wants to meet.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.298
- Why? What-what...?

04:16.381 --> 04:17.925
You know what? It don't matter.

04:18.008 --> 04:20.636
It d... It doesn't even fucking matter.
I'm there, okay?

04:20.719 --> 04:22.846
I'm there.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.433
Oh, shit.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.359
- I have seen all your films.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.779
I like all your films, but you, Kevin--

04:38.862 --> 04:41.281
you don't like your films.
- Wow, you can tell, huh?

04:41.365 --> 04:43.283
- Of course I can tell.

04:43.367 --> 04:46.328
You and I-- we are the same.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.956
My movies have grossed
billions of dollars.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.166
- Mm.
- Who cares?

04:51.250 --> 04:53.585
- Yeah, I mean,
it's not about the money, right?

04:53.669 --> 04:58.549
- It is about finding yourself
inside an artistic expression.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.050
- Yes.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.302
- I want to find you, Kevin.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.222
Will you let me find you?

05:05.305 --> 05:08.433
- You found me. I'm right here, man.

05:08.517 --> 05:13.146
- My next project is a serious,
gritty action film.

05:13.230 --> 05:16.859
It requires a serious, gritty actor.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.903
You, Kevin.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.406
I want you in the leading role.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.783
- Holy shit, man. You got to be...
- Oh.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.201
- Excuse you.

05:26.285 --> 05:27.870
Watch it, man.
- My apologies, sir.

05:27.953 --> 05:30.622
- Mark Wahlberg would not scream
at a party server.

05:30.706 --> 05:32.875
- Oh, I didn't scream.
I didn't... I didn't scream...

05:32.958 --> 05:35.294
- An action star is tough, confident,

05:35.377 --> 05:40.257
unfazed by minor details
that disrupt the average layperson.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.259
- Yeah, I... I was unfazed.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.095
I wasn't fazed at all from that.
- If you really want this part,

05:45.179 --> 05:48.265
I need you to attend a training program.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.268
All the best action stars
have gone through it.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.562
- I don't... You're talking, like,
an action star school?

05:53.645 --> 05:55.981
- Stallone. Van Damme.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.608
Steven Seagal.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.277
Jackie Chan. They're all alums.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.696
- Wow. I just kind of assumed
all those guys had the...

06:02.779 --> 06:04.364
had the juice,

06:04.448 --> 06:05.949
the mojo.
- Do you remember

06:06.033 --> 06:09.244
what Matt Damon was
before he was Jason Bourne?

06:09.328 --> 06:11.872
- Yeah, he-he'd just won an Oscar.

06:11.955 --> 06:15.250
- Neither do I.
This program turned a no-name Matt Damon

06:15.334 --> 06:18.253
into a leading man
revered around the world.

06:18.337 --> 06:22.424
- Look, with all due respect,
I don't need that.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.510
I don't, I don't need none of that.

06:24.593 --> 06:25.928
I'm ready now.

06:26.011 --> 06:29.181
I'm ready right now.

06:29.264 --> 06:30.807
- Down here, Kevin.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.977
You don't think you need training,

06:34.061 --> 06:36.313
you want the part right now.

06:36.396 --> 06:41.151
Well, your new part is waiting
for you on that rooftop.

06:44.279 --> 06:46.198
Go and get it!

06:59.086 --> 07:00.963
Oh, shit!

07:01.046 --> 07:03.298
Help! Help me!

07:03.382 --> 07:05.509
Help me!
- So good.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.177
He's doing his famous "Help me" scene

07:07.261 --> 07:09.012
from Ride Along 2.
- Help me! Help me!

07:09.096 --> 07:10.389
Help!

07:12.307 --> 07:14.518
- Look, Kev, I don't love the idea

07:14.601 --> 07:16.186
of you driving out
to the middle of nowhere

07:16.270 --> 07:18.230
to go to some...
- Action star school.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.232
- Right, yes. That, Kev.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.317
Maybe we just wait a little longer.

07:22.401 --> 07:24.444
Eventually, the studios will forget
how badly you fucked up,

07:24.528 --> 07:25.863
and they'll offer you a new sidekick role.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.740
- No. This is my time to shine!

07:28.824 --> 07:31.410
You believe in me, don't you?

07:31.493 --> 07:33.245
Don't you?

07:33.328 --> 07:35.414
Danny? You believe in...

07:35.497 --> 07:37.416
Oh, shit.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.459
Damn reception.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.303
Oh, hell, no.

07:59.855 --> 08:02.357
Ron Wilcox?

08:03.442 --> 08:05.277
Shit.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.196
Don't be a bitch, Kevin.

08:07.279 --> 08:10.115
Be Academy Award-winning Matt Damon.

08:10.199 --> 08:13.243
Get the fuck off my car.

08:16.872 --> 08:20.292
Um, hello?

08:22.044 --> 08:24.505
Anybody here?

08:25.672 --> 08:27.424
Claude Van De Velde sent me.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.551
- No, no.
You tell me what you want to tell me.

08:29.635 --> 08:31.512
Why are you here?

08:31.595 --> 08:33.347
Why are you here?
- Where's my nephew Rodrigo?

08:33.430 --> 08:35.474
- Uh, fellas?
- What do you mean, where's your nephew?

08:35.557 --> 08:37.309
I don't know
where the fuck your nephew is.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.478
- Hey!

08:39.561 --> 08:41.730
Excuse me.
- Now you don't trust me?

08:41.813 --> 08:44.233
- I know you murdered my nephew Rodrigo.

08:44.316 --> 08:45.901
- Bullshit, motherfucker!

08:45.984 --> 08:47.402
I didn't murder Rodrigo.

08:47.486 --> 08:49.696
Look, you got your money,
I got my shipment.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.740
I don't know where Rodrigo is.
- Oh.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.242
- Maybe he's fucking your mother.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.452
- Our training has already begun. Oh.

08:55.536 --> 08:56.954
Okay. Uh...

08:57.037 --> 08:58.372
- Oh, you-you... Oh, come on!

08:58.455 --> 08:59.831
Bring it! Bring it!

08:59.915 --> 09:01.542
Come on! Bring that bat, motherfucker!

09:01.625 --> 09:03.836
- Hey!

09:03.919 --> 09:07.589
You want to push somebody around,
try me out.

09:09.508 --> 09:13.428
- Hey, and what are you? A tough guy?

09:13.512 --> 09:14.972
- Goddamn right I'm a tough guy.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.640
North Philadelphia tough.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.642
I'm Kevin motherfucking...

09:18.725 --> 09:20.727
- Oh.
