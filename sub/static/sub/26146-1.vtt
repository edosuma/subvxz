00:39.656 --> 00:40.589
Oh...

00:43.023 --> 00:45.255
Oh...

00:45.257 --> 00:47.190
Come on, come on,
go, go, go, go!

00:47.623 --> 00:49.321
Look away.
Come on, we're coming through.

00:49.323 --> 00:51.021
- Go, go, go. Come on.
- You'll be okay.

00:51.023 --> 00:53.388
You'll be alright. It's alright.
You're gonna be fine.

00:53.390 --> 00:54.422
Thank you, Stubby.

00:54.689 --> 00:56.656
Come on. Out the way, everybody.
Let's go. Let's go.

00:58.357 --> 00:59.822
- Well done, boy.
- Good boy.

00:59.824 --> 01:02.021
He saved him again.

01:02.023 --> 01:03.090
That's a good dog.

01:42.724 --> 01:45.091
Get out of here,
you stinkin' mutt!

01:45.457 --> 01:48.322
Go rifle through
someone else's trash.

01:51.091 --> 01:52.957
Go!

01:58.157 --> 02:00.091
Watch it, mutt.

02:02.124 --> 02:03.222
Come on!

02:03.224 --> 02:04.488
Whose dog is that?

02:22.091 --> 02:23.390
We're so proud of you.

02:41.892 --> 02:44.558
- Take care!
- We're proud of you!

02:51.125 --> 02:54.056
<i>When my brother
put on the uniform</i>

02:54.058 --> 02:55.791
<i>of the United States Army,</i>

02:56.092 --> 02:58.359
<i>I was so very proud.</i>

02:58.858 --> 03:03.257
<i>In 1917, our country
went to war with Germany.</i>

03:03.259 --> 03:04.259
<i>All across the nation,</i>

03:04.558 --> 03:07.625
<i>thousands of young men
answered the call to fight.</i>

03:07.992 --> 03:09.522
<i>They were just boys.</i>

03:09.524 --> 03:12.456
<i>Well,
they were called Doughboys,</i>

03:12.458 --> 03:14.791
<i>and my brother Robert
was one of them.</i>

03:16.725 --> 03:20.156
<i>By the time we joined the war
in April 1917,</i>

03:20.158 --> 03:22.623
<i>the French and British
had already been fighting</i>

03:22.625 --> 03:25.958
<i>the mighty German Army
for three long years.</i>

03:26.225 --> 03:27.890
<i>Their spirits were low.</i>

03:27.892 --> 03:30.925
<i>But they were happy to know
that we were coming to help.</i>

03:31.691 --> 03:35.456
<i>This is the true story
of a special friendship</i>

03:35.458 --> 03:38.524
<i>my brother made
while training for the war.</i>

03:51.959 --> 03:53.224
Oh, no, you don't.

03:53.226 --> 03:54.424
Scram, mutt!

03:56.058 --> 03:57.125
Scram!

03:59.392 --> 04:03.390
Left! Left! Left, right, left!

04:03.392 --> 04:05.323
Platoon... halt!

04:05.325 --> 04:07.059
Left... face!

04:08.259 --> 04:09.459
At ease!

04:13.392 --> 04:15.291
No time for lip spittle, boys.

04:15.293 --> 04:19.390
We have four short weeks left
to turn you into soldiers.

04:19.392 --> 04:22.692
You've worked hard on drill,
learned teamwork,

04:23.126 --> 04:24.689
discipline. But...

04:24.691 --> 04:26.893
next is the crump-hole.

04:27.592 --> 04:29.893
That's why you and I are here.

04:38.260 --> 04:40.226
Wha...
How did this dog get in here?

04:40.559 --> 04:42.127
Get out! Get out of here!

04:43.692 --> 04:44.793
Hey!

04:45.893 --> 04:48.159
Ah!

04:48.392 --> 04:50.059
Hey. Hey. Shhh. Shhh.

04:50.294 --> 04:53.192
Get off of me. Come on, go.
I don't have any more food.

04:53.194 --> 04:54.126
Go away. Shoo.

04:54.459 --> 04:56.059
Come on, you're gonna get me
in trouble. Get off.

04:56.492 --> 04:57.725
Our General Pershing's...

04:57.727 --> 04:59.924
- Off. Go.
- ...gonna change all that.

04:59.926 --> 05:01.292
Shoo. Shoo.

05:01.294 --> 05:02.993
Go. Get away.

05:05.894 --> 05:07.492
When we get there,

05:07.894 --> 05:10.493
we're gonna take the fight
to the enemy.

05:13.426 --> 05:15.892
At least he's ready.

05:18.392 --> 05:20.959
This pooch belong to
any of you men?

05:26.626 --> 05:29.258
I see you eyeballing him,
Private Conroy.

05:29.260 --> 05:31.627
Better fetch that dog a bone.

05:32.294 --> 05:33.660
Looks like he could use it.

05:35.027 --> 05:37.860
Platoon, atten... tion!

05:41.361 --> 05:42.558
Dismissed.

05:42.560 --> 05:45.227
Alright. Come on, boy,
you heard the sergeant.

05:45.493 --> 05:46.526
Let's go.

05:46.927 --> 05:50.392
<i>And that's how Robert
met his new little buddy.</i>

05:51.793 --> 05:54.960
Come on, move along.
This is not a picnic.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.325
It's that mutt again.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.927
Sergeant says get him fed.

06:02.227 --> 06:04.359
Eh? I don't cook for dogs.

06:04.361 --> 06:06.192
Hey, Biscuit,
he might be the only one

06:06.194 --> 06:07.691
that likes your cooking.

06:07.693 --> 06:09.094
Better be nice to him.

06:12.727 --> 06:14.458
You really know
how to make friends,

06:14.460 --> 06:15.458
don't you, Olsen?

06:15.460 --> 06:17.627
Sure do. Always.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.424
You, uh,
find a new buddy, Conroy?

06:20.426 --> 06:22.858
No, actually, he kinda found me.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.925
Isn't that right, boy?

06:24.927 --> 06:27.558
Can't believe
the sergeant let the dog stay.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.759
- He must feel sorry for us.
- Alright, alright.

06:29.761 --> 06:33.194
The sergeant gave him a pass,
but the colonel never will.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.691
Maybe the sergeant wanted
a mascot,

06:35.693 --> 06:36.993
to give the unit
a different look.

06:36.995 --> 06:40.524
Ugh. A different smell, too.
Hey, no, wait!

06:40.526 --> 06:43.125
What the...
No! Bad dog! Bad dog!

06:44.761 --> 06:45.793
I hate dogs.

07:02.628 --> 07:04.126
No, no, no, no, no.

07:04.128 --> 07:05.492
Hey, hey, listen.

07:05.494 --> 07:07.061
Listen. Stay.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.128
No. St...

07:10.694 --> 07:11.893
Stay.

07:11.895 --> 07:12.928
Good.

07:13.394 --> 07:16.661
You sleep there, on the floor,
not in my bed.

07:17.728 --> 07:18.661
Good.

07:20.461 --> 07:22.859
Good night, boy.

07:38.728 --> 07:42.159
That's enough shuteye!
On your feet! Out of the sack!

07:45.895 --> 07:50.062
Left! Left! Left, right, left!

07:50.394 --> 07:52.829
Column left... march!

08:01.729 --> 08:06.760
Left! Left! Left, right, left!
Left! Left! Left, right, left!

08:06.762 --> 08:08.162
Left! Left!

08:11.096 --> 08:12.425
Go! Go! Go!

08:15.428 --> 08:17.693
Over the wall, Clayborn,
not through it!

08:17.695 --> 08:19.428
I got it.

08:32.328 --> 08:33.594
Whose target is that?

08:33.794 --> 08:35.761
Hey, boy, go fetch it.

08:38.528 --> 08:40.562
He's quite a dog you got there,
Conroy.

08:40.897 --> 08:43.630
Not even afraid
of the sound of gunfire.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.227
Well done, soldier.

08:50.229 --> 08:52.727
- Thank you, Sergeant.
- Not you.

08:52.729 --> 08:54.996
You missed the target
completely.

08:55.329 --> 08:58.129
I was talking to the dog.

08:58.896 --> 09:01.793
Pick up your feet, Olsen!
One after the other!

09:06.129 --> 09:07.693
Oh. Ow.

09:07.695 --> 09:10.595
Back of the line, Conroy.
Do it again.

09:17.830 --> 09:20.894
Put your glasses on, Schroeder!
The enemy's that way!

09:28.496 --> 09:30.894
<i>I loved hearing
how this little dog</i>

09:30.896 --> 09:33.394
<i>trained right alongside Robert
and his buddies.</i>

09:33.396 --> 09:35.493
Platoon... halt!

09:35.495 --> 09:38.328
<i>Robert's letters
were full of his exploits.</i>

09:38.330 --> 09:41.594
<i>It made me happy to know
how much joy</i>

09:41.596 --> 09:43.695
<i>the dog brought
to my kid brother.</i>

09:44.097 --> 09:45.396
At ease.

09:49.030 --> 09:50.494
Look at him.

09:50.496 --> 09:52.728
He has been training
alongside you guys

09:52.730 --> 09:54.930
and he drills better
than most of you.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.463
You could all learn something
from him.

10:11.563 --> 10:14.394
I hope you'll be able to
keep him, Conroy.

10:14.396 --> 10:15.995
This is the army, Schroeder.

10:15.997 --> 10:18.462
If they don't issue it,
you don't need it.

10:18.464 --> 10:20.265
That includes pets.

10:20.696 --> 10:22.628
All the same, I'm keeping him.

10:22.630 --> 10:24.962
In fact,
I thought of a name for him...

10:24.964 --> 10:25.962
Stubby.

10:28.063 --> 10:30.095
It's a perfect name
for a perfect little tail.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.628
Ain't that right?

10:31.630 --> 10:32.930
Yeah, right, Stubby?

10:33.796 --> 10:35.896
Whoa. One thing's for certain.

10:35.898 --> 10:39.831
When the colonel catches him,
it's bye-bye, doggie.

10:40.997 --> 10:42.631
Hm.

10:43.098 --> 10:44.164
Maybe not.

10:45.098 --> 10:46.561
Alright, bud.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.729
Listen to me, listen.
Alright, stay calm.

10:49.731 --> 10:52.863
Stay... No, listen. Sit. Sit.

10:53.497 --> 10:54.828
Stubby, come on.

10:54.830 --> 10:57.198
We're gonna stay here all night
until we get this right.

10:57.529 --> 11:00.062
Hold it... hold it.

11:01.163 --> 11:02.931
Hold... it.

11:12.298 --> 11:15.862
<i>♪ Over there, over there</i>

11:15.864 --> 11:19.697
<i>♪ Send the word
send the word over there ♪</i>

11:20.031 --> 11:22.664
That's you, men.
You're the Yankee Division.

11:23.365 --> 11:25.096
That includes you too, Stubby.

11:26.697 --> 11:30.062
What in Sam Hill
is that dog doing here?

11:30.064 --> 11:31.862
Platoon, attention!

11:31.864 --> 11:34.862
This is an army base,
not a petting zoo!

11:34.864 --> 11:35.797
Whose dog is this?

11:36.731 --> 11:39.495
Yes, he's my dog, Colonel, sir.

11:45.099 --> 11:47.530
What in tarnation?

11:48.164 --> 11:49.630
Did you train this dog, soldier?

11:49.632 --> 11:52.131
Yes, sir.
Wasn't that hard, sir.

11:53.498 --> 11:54.529
Next thing you know,

11:54.531 --> 11:56.431
he'll be barking out
general orders.

11:56.899 --> 11:59.530
Uh, sir, what would you
have us do with the dog?

12:00.131 --> 12:03.297
Well, as long as that dog
soldiers like that,

12:03.299 --> 12:05.563
he's as welcome as any man
in this army.

12:05.565 --> 12:06.932
Carry on, men.

12:12.632 --> 12:14.131
You're something else, Stubby.

12:51.132 --> 12:54.197
Remove your gas masks. Do it!

12:54.199 --> 12:55.632
Do it now!

13:07.065 --> 13:08.598
Outside! Now!

13:14.099 --> 13:15.566
This is teargas, men,

13:15.932 --> 13:19.563
not the mustard or poisonous gas
you will be facing.

13:19.565 --> 13:22.396
Keep your masks handy
at all times.

13:22.398 --> 13:24.963
Get used to them,
learn to live in them.

13:55.233 --> 13:57.397
Alright, Stubs, here we go.

14:03.733 --> 14:06.597
Ah, okay, Stubby,
you're too quick for me, boy.

14:06.599 --> 14:08.931
Left! Left!

14:08.933 --> 14:10.999
Left, right, left!

14:11.001 --> 14:12.800
To the rear! March!

14:13.367 --> 14:14.966
Left! Left!

14:15.567 --> 14:17.166
Left, right, left!

14:17.900 --> 14:19.466
Left! Left!

14:19.900 --> 14:21.633
Left, right, left!

14:22.466 --> 14:24.166
Platoon... halt!

14:24.634 --> 14:27.500
Left... face! At ease.

14:28.234 --> 14:29.400
Well done, gentlemen.

14:29.933 --> 14:31.466
You've come a long way.

14:31.833 --> 14:33.067
You too, Stubby.

14:35.767 --> 14:38.933
Yep, that's right,
it's chow time, boy.

14:39.433 --> 14:41.831
Hey, Stubby,
look what I got for you.

14:41.833 --> 14:45.099
Hey, Biscuit, can we get
something other than dog food?

14:45.101 --> 14:47.798
I'm not talking to you, Olsen.
I'm talking to Stubby.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.431
How'd you end up here,
Schroeder?

14:49.433 --> 14:51.565
Yeah, you're a German,
ain't you?

14:51.567 --> 14:55.232
If a German doesn't join,
he's a slacker.

14:55.234 --> 14:57.465
- A what?
- A draft dodger.

14:57.467 --> 14:59.064
That's why you joined?

14:59.066 --> 15:02.167
Do you see how people
look at Germans these days?

15:02.833 --> 15:03.798
If I didn't join,

15:03.800 --> 15:05.398
I couldn't call myself
an American.

15:05.400 --> 15:09.500
Hey, you know what, Schroeder?
You're an American in my book.

15:11.567 --> 15:14.132
I've watched you men
become soldiers.

15:14.134 --> 15:15.634
It makes me proud.

15:16.001 --> 15:16.867
You, too, Stubby.

15:17.234 --> 15:19.732
I hope you stay on the base
to look after the next group.

15:19.734 --> 15:22.398
Now, take this weekend
to write your letters

15:22.400 --> 15:23.967
and say your farewells.

15:24.301 --> 15:26.165
And pray that
we will all be home

15:26.167 --> 15:28.099
safe and sound very soon.

15:28.101 --> 15:29.901
We ship out on Monday night.

15:30.834 --> 15:31.932
God bless us all,

15:31.934 --> 15:35.565
and God bless
the United States of America.

15:35.567 --> 15:37.568
Take charge of your men,
Sergeant.

15:41.600 --> 15:42.901
Dismissed!

15:52.302 --> 15:53.531
<i>Robert told me</i>

15:53.533 --> 15:55.833
<i>how scared
he and the other boys were</i>

15:55.835 --> 16:00.468
<i>when they finally got word
it was time to go to war.</i>

16:02.767 --> 16:05.866
<i>I didn't receive Robert's
last letter from camp</i>

16:05.868 --> 16:07.866
<i>until he had set sail
for France.</i>

16:07.868 --> 16:10.301
<i>He wrote me about
how he would miss me,</i>

16:10.902 --> 16:13.566
<i>but mainly
how heartbroken he was</i>

16:13.568 --> 16:15.700
<i>at having to leave Stubby
behind.</i>

16:17.369 --> 16:19.801
Not right now, Stubby.

16:23.269 --> 16:24.935
<i>I was just so worried,</i>

16:25.369 --> 16:27.866
<i>and I prayed
he'd be home again soon.</i>

16:32.434 --> 16:36.068
Stubby, come on.
This is really hard for me, too.

16:36.501 --> 16:37.633
You're going to be fine

16:37.635 --> 16:39.668
and I will be back
before you know it.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.103
Look. I got a gift for you.

17:04.169 --> 17:05.499
Hold it, Stubby, hold it!

17:07.136 --> 17:10.167
Look at you, handsome boy!
Looking good, Stubby!

17:13.800 --> 17:14.835
Come now.

17:22.836 --> 17:23.866
Like I promised,

17:23.867 --> 17:25.800
he'll be here for you
when you get back.

17:26.303 --> 17:28.002
I'll take good care of him.

17:29.601 --> 17:32.168
You hear that, Stubby?
You'll never be hungry.

18:03.435 --> 18:04.600
Stay, Stubby.

18:04.602 --> 18:06.502
Don't worry, I'll be back soon.

18:06.702 --> 18:08.967
Come on, Conroy,
get in line. Let's go.

18:43.970 --> 18:45.536
Stubby! Where you going?

20:10.703 --> 20:12.938
Up, up, up, up.

20:13.570 --> 20:16.738
Bring that up. Hey.
Hey, watch your head over there.

20:18.038 --> 20:19.404
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

22:22.739 --> 22:23.672
Ow.

22:23.906 --> 22:25.007
Stubby?

22:25.973 --> 22:27.105
How did you get here?

22:27.107 --> 22:29.470
Where did you come from?
How did you get here?

22:29.472 --> 22:31.006
What are we going to do
with you?

22:31.606 --> 22:33.070
We'll have to hide you.

22:33.072 --> 22:34.437
Somehow.

22:34.439 --> 22:36.338
Oh, brother, it's the mutt.

22:36.340 --> 22:37.907
How did he get here?

22:38.273 --> 22:40.072
I don't know. It's a miracle.

22:41.072 --> 22:44.140
Stubby, you're just so clever,
aren't you?

22:45.539 --> 22:47.538
This is a really dumb idea.

22:48.639 --> 22:51.206
Shhh, Stubby.

22:51.439 --> 22:53.172
Shhh.
We can't let them hear you.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.372
When they find him,

22:55.374 --> 22:57.406
they're gonna throw him
overboard.

23:02.339 --> 23:04.804
Who in the...? What...?

23:04.806 --> 23:05.872
What the...?

23:06.573 --> 23:08.840
What the devil is going on here?

23:17.374 --> 23:19.606
Better salute, sir.

23:21.307 --> 23:23.571
Someone's got
a lot of explaining to do.

23:23.573 --> 23:25.907
Who smuggled this dog aboard?

23:26.439 --> 23:28.205
He followed me on the train,
sir!

23:28.207 --> 23:29.504
He was quite determined.

23:29.506 --> 23:31.706
But I swear I did not carry him
on board, sir.

23:32.140 --> 23:35.606
He sort of became the regiment's
unofficial mascot, sir.

23:39.473 --> 23:41.840
I didn't carry him on board,
either, sir.

23:45.673 --> 23:47.773
You're quite resourceful,
aren't you, boy?

23:48.141 --> 23:49.874
Why, thank you, fella.

23:50.707 --> 23:51.908
Well, I guess it's better

23:52.107 --> 23:55.540
to have every man and every dog
we can get in this fight.

23:56.507 --> 24:00.506
Make sure he receives some...
dog tags. Carry on.

24:02.641 --> 24:05.907
Mother! How does he keep
getting away with this?

24:15.507 --> 24:18.707
There ya go, Stubby.
You're a real Yankee now.

24:21.908 --> 24:24.206
<i>Every day,
we scanned the newspapers</i>

24:24.208 --> 24:25.674
<i>for news of the Minnesota.</i>

24:26.074 --> 24:27.605
<i>They were full of stories</i>

24:27.607 --> 24:29.939
<i>about our boys
being lost at sea,</i>

24:29.941 --> 24:32.108
<i>but nothing
about the Yankee Division.</i>

24:32.540 --> 24:35.774
<i>I had no idea that Stubby
had made it onboard.</i>

24:45.241 --> 24:48.140
<i>It was two long months
before I got word</i>

24:48.142 --> 24:51.275
<i>that Robert and Stubby
were safely in France...</i>

24:52.074 --> 24:54.174
<i>when I heard that
they were headed into action</i>

24:54.475 --> 24:56.906
<i>at a place
called Chemin des Dames,</i>

24:56.908 --> 24:59.908
<i>where they were going
to join the French lines.</i>

25:25.108 --> 25:27.675
The Americans.

25:41.109 --> 25:41.940
Mother, they look like

25:41.942 --> 25:43.706
they've been
through the wringer.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.109
That's why we're here, I guess.

25:46.775 --> 25:47.942
Shhh.

26:32.377 --> 26:34.807
<i>Evidently,
Stubby wasted no time</i>

26:34.809 --> 26:36.309
in making himself useful.

26:36.743 --> 26:39.743
<i>He began by clearing
the vermin from the trenches.</i>

26:45.210 --> 26:47.376
I'm hungry.

26:47.809 --> 26:49.874
Somebody tell me
there's breakfast.

27:03.010 --> 27:06.843
Incoming! Take cover!

27:07.409 --> 27:09.574
Get down. Get down!

27:09.576 --> 27:11.540
- Hey, get down!
- Oh!

27:14.377 --> 27:17.807
- Medic! Medic!
- Keep down!

27:20.943 --> 27:22.407
<i>Attention!</i>

27:35.310 --> 27:37.474
<i>From his first day in action,</i>

27:37.476 --> 27:39.608
<i>Stubby was on a mission.</i>

27:39.610 --> 27:41.241
Medic!

27:41.243 --> 27:44.211
<i>And he dug out
many soldiers who'd been buried.</i>

27:46.777 --> 27:49.341
<i>Robert was so proud of him.</i>

27:51.677 --> 27:53.876
Injured man coming through!

27:54.311 --> 27:56.774
To your positions!
You must hold them!

27:56.776 --> 27:59.677
Stay on the wall
and watch for an attack!

28:03.378 --> 28:05.077
Come, Sergeant, look.

28:08.442 --> 28:10.144
I'll be darned.

28:12.943 --> 28:16.443
Okay, but we must not let down
our guard.

28:16.844 --> 28:19.142
This time,
it was only a little welcome

28:19.144 --> 28:20.610
from our Boche friends.

28:24.043 --> 28:26.675
Move along, Yanks, move along.

28:26.677 --> 28:29.808
You cannot save us
if you hang around in here.

28:29.810 --> 28:31.541
Come on. Next.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.744
I don't think they like us.

28:34.278 --> 28:35.974
I thought "Yankee"
was a good word.

28:35.976 --> 28:38.610
Excuse me, uh,
something for my dog, please.

28:39.177 --> 28:40.542
For your dog?

28:40.544 --> 28:42.575
Are you crazy, Yankee?

28:42.577 --> 28:45.675
He is a soldier.
He's the division mascot.

28:45.677 --> 28:47.242
Name's Stubby.

28:47.244 --> 28:48.510
You see his dog tags?

28:49.443 --> 28:51.475
And now a Boche is telling me

28:51.477 --> 28:54.477
to give good French food
to an American dog?

28:54.677 --> 28:57.541
This war
is getting crazier every day.

28:57.543 --> 28:59.608
I am an American.

28:59.610 --> 29:02.276
Oh, <i>ja, ja.</i>
Of course you are.

29:02.278 --> 29:04.277
Yeah.

29:04.279 --> 29:07.508
He is American!
Do you understand?

29:07.510 --> 29:09.642
Well, he sounds like a Boche
to me.

29:09.644 --> 29:11.743
And you sound like a moron,
froggy!

29:11.745 --> 29:12.909
<i>Quoi?</i>

29:12.911 --> 29:13.711
Ow!

29:15.345 --> 29:16.642
Enough, you two.

29:16.644 --> 29:19.376
We are here to fight the Boche,
not each other.

29:19.378 --> 29:21.408
<i>Allez.</i>

29:21.410 --> 29:22.843
<i>Un bisou.</i>

29:27.078 --> 29:28.379
Now, that's better.

29:28.912 --> 29:31.441
We are all friend now, huh?

29:31.443 --> 29:33.709
Stubby, shhh.
Calm down. Calm down.

29:33.711 --> 29:35.042
Come here.
Calm down, Stubby.

29:35.044 --> 29:38.744
American soldier.
You must be Conroy, no?

29:39.145 --> 29:40.776
Yes. I'm... I'm Conroy.

29:40.778 --> 29:44.242
I am Gaston Baptiste
of the Third Regiment,

29:44.244 --> 29:46.478
and we are to be working
together.

29:46.945 --> 29:48.377
My Capitaine says,

29:48.379 --> 29:50.377
"Look for a man
with a little dog."

29:50.379 --> 29:51.576
Hmm. Really?

29:51.578 --> 29:55.476
Yes. You, me and your,
uh, little friend...

29:56.778 --> 29:59.277
You will get so close
to the Boche,

29:59.279 --> 30:02.544
you will be able to smell them.

30:10.312 --> 30:12.578
Have you ever used
one of these?

30:12.978 --> 30:13.876
Hmm?

30:13.878 --> 30:16.145
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, in basic training.

30:18.578 --> 30:21.409
It's also perfect for cheese.

30:21.411 --> 30:22.812
Want to try some?

30:24.878 --> 30:29.144
I must apologize for this slop
that cook calls food.

30:29.146 --> 30:33.044
- It's war. I understand.
- No, there is no excuse!

30:33.046 --> 30:37.743
Napoleon says
an army marches on its stomach,

30:37.745 --> 30:41.478
so they should fill ours
with good food.

30:42.444 --> 30:44.011
<i>Voila.</i>

30:44.013 --> 30:45.044
Uh...

30:45.046 --> 30:47.644
So, what exactly
are we going to be doing?

30:47.646 --> 30:49.843
Can you ride a horse? No?

30:49.845 --> 30:53.144
Yes, yes. I mean, I'm...
I might not be the best,

30:53.146 --> 30:54.977
but you know, I'm okay.

30:54.979 --> 30:57.877
Good, because our officers
have decided

30:57.879 --> 31:00.113
that we will be spying
on the Boche.

31:00.912 --> 31:02.011
Hmm?

31:02.013 --> 31:04.476
You, me and, uh...

31:04.478 --> 31:06.777
- Salty.
- Actually, it's Stubby.

31:06.779 --> 31:09.879
Okay.
But first, let's celebrate.

31:12.046 --> 31:13.777
Uh... No.

31:13.779 --> 31:15.946
No, <i>mais</i> it's only wine.

31:16.280 --> 31:18.744
You don't like wine,
American soldier?

31:20.013 --> 31:23.144
I never drank wine, and I'm sure
it's against the rules for us.

31:23.146 --> 31:25.311
The rules? What rules?

31:25.313 --> 31:26.846
Ha! This is war.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.177
Ah. Without wine,

31:32.179 --> 31:35.510
we French would not
have survived these three years,

31:35.512 --> 31:37.578
so they give it to us.

31:37.580 --> 31:40.946
- The French army gives you wine?
- <i>Bien sûr, mon ami!</i>

31:41.313 --> 31:44.445
We French go from the milk
of our mothers

31:44.747 --> 31:46.511
to the juice of the vine.

31:46.513 --> 31:48.177
Hey, you hear that, Stubby?

31:48.179 --> 31:49.544
They get wine.

31:49.546 --> 31:50.946
Eh. Okay, let's go.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.745
Hey, Conroy, Conroy.
What's happening?

31:58.747 --> 32:01.946
Uh, apparently,
I have to follow him.

32:03.180 --> 32:04.579
Eh. Lucky you.

32:05.114 --> 32:06.980
And you two, come with me.

32:23.446 --> 32:24.779
This is horrible.

32:25.679 --> 32:27.479
Everything's destroyed.

32:28.813 --> 32:29.780
Everything.

32:30.446 --> 32:32.880
No, not everything

32:37.314 --> 32:39.080
Stubby, down!

32:43.314 --> 32:44.347
Come, my friends.

32:44.647 --> 32:46.411
Those are ours.

32:46.413 --> 32:48.780
We pay them back
for this morning.

32:49.314 --> 32:50.980
I thought
we were being attacked.

32:51.446 --> 32:53.345
You will soon know
the difference

32:53.347 --> 32:55.814
between theirs and ours.

33:12.980 --> 33:14.179
<i>Et voilà.</i>

33:14.181 --> 33:16.546
Here it is, your new home.

33:20.247 --> 33:21.912
Sweet dreams.

33:21.914 --> 33:24.713
Get up now, everybody!

33:25.215 --> 33:26.578
Everybody, get up!

33:26.580 --> 33:28.113
Come on, Conroy.

33:33.648 --> 33:34.945
Now, let me sleep Stubby,

33:34.947 --> 33:37.846
just let me sleep
a little bit more.

33:37.848 --> 33:38.915
Woof-woof.

33:40.446 --> 33:43.545
- Oh. Uh. Ah. Sorry.
- Alright, get up now.

33:43.547 --> 33:47.013
Yeah, I'm up, I'm up.
I'm up. I'm getting up.

34:02.648 --> 34:05.881
Uh...
Have you done this before?

34:06.315 --> 34:10.614
Don't worry, it will be fine.
I've done this many times.

34:11.581 --> 34:13.014
Where did you find him?

34:13.848 --> 34:16.246
Oh. Uh...
He was living rough.

34:16.248 --> 34:17.982
He joined us
when we were training.

34:18.982 --> 34:20.481
He's not very beautiful.

34:20.848 --> 34:21.781
Oh. Pfft.

34:22.282 --> 34:25.081
Maybe not,
but he's got real character.

34:25.415 --> 34:26.512
Just like me.

34:26.514 --> 34:29.114
I'm not the most beautiful,

34:29.116 --> 34:31.849
but I'm strong and lovable.

34:32.382 --> 34:34.981
Uh-huh.

34:35.781 --> 34:39.547
This is the place.
We get a good view from here.

35:06.115 --> 35:07.216
What do you see?

35:15.149 --> 35:17.081
Look.

35:18.149 --> 35:19.316
It's gas.

35:19.749 --> 35:21.916
We need to sound the alarm.
Let's go.

35:32.548 --> 35:34.849
- Halt!
- Run! Run!

35:35.116 --> 35:36.815
Stop!

35:37.183 --> 35:40.216
I said stop! Halt!

35:44.216 --> 35:48.016
- The horses! Stay here! Stay!
- Stay, stay! Come on!

35:48.649 --> 35:51.050
Stubby, go!
Go tell them, Stubby, go!

36:22.317 --> 36:25.549
What? Stubby?
Okay! Gas!

36:26.384 --> 36:27.748
Gas!

36:27.750 --> 36:29.483
Gas!

36:33.716 --> 36:35.981
Move it, move it, move it!

36:35.983 --> 36:38.883
Let's go, let's go!
Get a move on!

36:43.083 --> 36:45.550
Oh.

36:52.416 --> 36:54.183
<i>Feuer!</i>

37:14.384 --> 37:16.948
Hey, little dog.

37:19.883 --> 37:21.249
Oh. Oh, no.

37:21.251 --> 37:24.348
Gas? Gas! Look, gas!

37:24.350 --> 37:26.649
The dog is trying to warn us!

37:26.651 --> 37:29.482
Everybody, go inside
and put on your masks!

37:34.417 --> 37:36.684
There he is! Stubby!

37:48.951 --> 37:51.016
Oh, no,
we don't have a mask for him!

37:51.018 --> 37:52.283
What are we gonna do?

37:53.984 --> 37:55.116
Ah. There, there.

37:55.118 --> 37:56.251
Hold on. Wait.

37:56.784 --> 37:59.049
It's okay, Stubby. It's okay.
Good boy.

37:59.051 --> 38:01.984
- You've done well.
- <i>Allez, calme-toi. Calme-toi.</i>

38:19.951 --> 38:20.849
It's okay. Shhh.

38:20.851 --> 38:23.550
Stubby, it's gonna be okay.
Shhh.

39:05.752 --> 39:07.682
- <i>Ça va?</i>
- <i>Ça va.</i>

39:07.684 --> 39:08.750
Hey!

39:08.752 --> 39:11.052
Come here. Come here, boy.

39:12.418 --> 39:14.150
Thank you
from our whole village!

39:14.152 --> 39:15.585
His name is Stubby.

39:16.019 --> 39:19.518
Ah. Stubby.
You are our hero, Stubby.

39:21.518 --> 39:22.850
<i>Robert's letters were full</i>

39:22.852 --> 39:26.052
<i>of just how beloved Stubby was
by everyone.</i>

39:28.451 --> 39:30.052
- <i>Merci.</i>
- <i>Merci à toi.</i>

39:31.552 --> 39:33.783
<i>It was as if he lived every day</i>

39:33.785 --> 39:37.051
<i>through the heroics
of this little canine wonder.</i>

39:37.053 --> 39:38.085
<i>Merci.</i>

39:38.485 --> 39:41.150
Yeah, but they were so generous.

39:41.152 --> 39:43.519
Yes, yes, but no meat.

39:48.920 --> 39:52.519
Mm, I think this war
has just improved.

39:54.253 --> 39:56.883
Mm! Like a magician,

39:56.885 --> 40:00.418
I'm creating magic
with a simple rabbit.

40:02.419 --> 40:06.251
<i>Allez, Olsen.</i>
Now you throw the <i>cochonnet.</i>

40:06.253 --> 40:08.184
- The what?
- This.

40:08.186 --> 40:10.285
Not too far, not too close.

40:10.287 --> 40:11.717
<i>Bon, bon, bon, bon, bon.</i>
I explain.

40:11.719 --> 40:15.550
It must land
within six to ten meters

40:15.552 --> 40:17.452
of the starting circle.

40:17.953 --> 40:20.651
<i>Allez, Olsen,</i>
now you throw the <i>cochonnet.</i>

40:20.653 --> 40:22.753
- Okay.
- You can do it, Olsen.

40:27.486 --> 40:29.651
<i>Sacre bleu!
Rends-nous le cochonnet!</i>

40:29.653 --> 40:32.851
Give us the <i>cochonnet, cabot!
Sale petit chien!</i>

40:33.953 --> 40:35.285
Stubby...

40:35.287 --> 40:36.953
Drop it, Stubby. Drop it.

40:38.886 --> 40:40.018
<i>Ah. Merci!</i>

40:40.020 --> 40:43.485
No, Stubby,
you can't take the <i>cochonnet.</i>

40:43.487 --> 40:46.252
<i>Pétanque</i> is a very
serious business

40:46.254 --> 40:47.385
in this country.

40:47.387 --> 40:49.717
War has started for less.

40:49.719 --> 40:52.318
Sorry. He just...
he loves to play ball.

40:52.320 --> 40:54.851
Mm...
Ta-dah. <i>C'est prêt!</i>

40:56.020 --> 40:57.986
Now we are ready to eat.

40:59.719 --> 41:01.754
Ah, excuse me
for my bad manners.

41:02.287 --> 41:04.753
It's your rabbit, too, Stubby.

41:08.819 --> 41:10.785
Mm. Whoa!

41:10.787 --> 41:12.687
This... this is really good.

41:13.553 --> 41:16.386
Yes, is very tasty, huh?

41:16.388 --> 41:17.920
Even if I say myself.

41:20.820 --> 41:22.752
- <i>À moi le point!</i>
- Okay.

41:22.754 --> 41:24.785
Now,
if you want to score the point,

41:24.787 --> 41:27.786
you see that ball there?
Hit it hard.

41:28.520 --> 41:32.152
You know, we should take
a little after-dinner stroll,

41:32.154 --> 41:33.517
while we still can.

41:33.519 --> 41:35.119
Yeah, sure.

41:35.121 --> 41:36.153
C'mon, Stubby.

41:46.453 --> 41:48.820
Nice shot.

41:56.887 --> 41:58.121
Okay, alright.

42:08.987 --> 42:10.286
I have no tobacco,

42:10.288 --> 42:12.551
but I carry it everywhere
with me.

42:12.553 --> 42:14.520
It was a present from my wife.

42:16.754 --> 42:18.854
I never showed you my family.

42:19.487 --> 42:21.485
- Wow, three girls.
- Yes.

42:21.487 --> 42:26.588
Jeanne. She's 11. Manon, eight.
And Madeleine, six.

42:27.488 --> 42:29.754
They capture my heart
completely.

42:30.355 --> 42:32.518
They would love
to play with you, Stubby.

42:32.520 --> 42:35.053
They would take you
into the forest,

42:35.055 --> 42:36.586
chasing the <i>sanglier.</i>

42:36.588 --> 42:38.085
Yeah, <i>sanglier.</i>

42:38.087 --> 42:39.718
Uh, what... what are they?

42:39.720 --> 42:43.353
Wild pigs.
You know, with the tusks.

42:43.355 --> 42:45.319
Oh. Oh, I get it.

42:45.321 --> 42:47.154
Your daughters chase wild pigs?

42:47.655 --> 42:50.552
Yes. One day,
they will make fine hunters.

42:50.554 --> 42:51.655
Really?

42:52.222 --> 42:54.086
Uh...
And what about you?

42:54.088 --> 42:54.986
Uh...

42:54.988 --> 42:58.053
My sister Margaret
is like a mom to me

42:58.055 --> 42:59.454
and my two younger sisters.

43:00.021 --> 43:02.519
She cared for our mother
before she passed,

43:02.521 --> 43:04.687
and my dad passed away
when I was five.

43:05.155 --> 43:07.554
I do hope to have a wife
and children one day.

43:08.222 --> 43:12.322
It is the best. My wife, Alice,
she's, uh... how you say?

43:12.688 --> 43:16.920
...nagging me all the time,
but I wouldn't change her.

43:18.122 --> 43:21.886
- When did you last see them?
- It is more than two years.

43:21.888 --> 43:23.253
Two years?

43:23.255 --> 43:25.955
Wow, that's a darned long time.

43:26.622 --> 43:28.086
Don't you ever get lonely?

43:28.088 --> 43:30.853
Yes. Well, sometimes.

43:30.855 --> 43:36.122
But now you Americans are here,
it will be over soon, you know.

43:36.554 --> 43:39.719
Two kings! I win!

43:39.721 --> 43:44.452
Look, I have two kings!
Ha-ha! I beat you, Yankee.

43:44.454 --> 43:47.088
Hold on a minute.
Hold... hold on a minute.

43:47.421 --> 43:50.886
I have a flush, so... I won.

43:50.888 --> 43:54.087
Flush? Flush, flush, flush,
flush, flush...

43:54.089 --> 43:55.619
What is this flush?

43:55.621 --> 43:58.488
Surely the kings are the kings,
you know, the best!

44:00.822 --> 44:02.020
So, um,

44:02.022 --> 44:03.688
before you were a soldier,
what did you do?

44:04.089 --> 44:07.787
I'm a chef in my own restaurant.
A good restaurant.

44:07.789 --> 44:10.820
Ah! That's why
you're such a good cook.

44:10.822 --> 44:14.187
A real French chef
cooking dinner for us, Stubby.

44:14.189 --> 44:15.753
What do you think of that, huh?

44:15.755 --> 44:17.956
This is how I learn my English.

44:18.589 --> 44:20.587
And you, what do you do?

44:20.589 --> 44:22.388
I work in a builder's
hardware store, uh,

44:22.390 --> 44:23.922
selling screws and nails.

44:24.689 --> 44:27.223
It's not a great job, but...
it's home.

44:27.522 --> 44:28.654
I miss it.

44:28.656 --> 44:31.954
We French make home
wherever we are.

44:31.956 --> 44:35.689
It's about food,
wine and good company.

44:36.788 --> 44:39.820
You know, on a night like this,

44:39.822 --> 44:41.923
we can forget about the war.

44:49.522 --> 44:52.487
We heard the attack
and came as fast as we could!

44:52.489 --> 44:54.155
Where do you want us to be,
Sergeant?

44:54.157 --> 44:55.420
We've beaten them back for now,

44:55.422 --> 44:57.821
but Clayborn
is still somewhere out there.

44:57.823 --> 44:59.121
Gotta bring him in somehow.

44:59.123 --> 45:01.554
We got wounded! We got wounded!

45:01.556 --> 45:02.720
Coming through, guys,

45:02.722 --> 45:04.355
coming through!
Mind your backs! Stretchers!

45:04.357 --> 45:06.288
- Stubby!
- Come on, let's go!

45:06.290 --> 45:07.857
Where are you going, Conroy?

45:32.657 --> 45:34.987
I can't see anything.

45:36.391 --> 45:37.689
Stubby!

45:46.690 --> 45:47.757
Oh...

45:49.924 --> 45:52.255
Oh...

45:52.257 --> 45:54.723
Get down!

45:56.391 --> 45:59.024
Smoke at 7-5-0 yards!

46:05.823 --> 46:08.790
Come on, go, go, go, go, go!

46:10.224 --> 46:13.224
<i>I realized that
every day spelled danger.</i>

46:13.723 --> 46:16.124
<i>There was no letup for our boys.</i>

46:21.924 --> 46:23.622
Out the way.
Come on. We're coming through.

46:23.624 --> 46:25.522
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Come on. You're gonna be okay.

46:25.524 --> 46:26.655
You're gonna be alright.
It's alright.

46:26.657 --> 46:28.258
- You're gonna be fine.
- Good boy.

46:28.790 --> 46:30.554
Come on. Out the way, everybody.
Let's go.

46:30.556 --> 46:32.057
Thank you, Stubby.

46:35.890 --> 46:38.588
<i>I got word in April of 1918</i>

46:38.590 --> 46:39.889
<i>that the Yankee Division</i>

46:39.891 --> 46:43.791
<i>was moving to a new
battle sector at Seicheprey.</i>

46:58.191 --> 46:59.658
Look... look at him!

47:00.091 --> 47:03.258
Mother! How that mutt survived,
I'll never know.

47:03.523 --> 47:05.123
I was sure
the Boche would get him.

47:05.125 --> 47:06.358
He is so lucky.

47:06.624 --> 47:08.323
He's so brave.

47:08.325 --> 47:10.323
I wish I had half his courage.

47:10.325 --> 47:12.689
Courage? It's not courage.

47:12.691 --> 47:14.824
It's dumb luck. Believe me.

47:18.591 --> 47:19.992
- <i>Monsieur?</i>
- Hey, Stubby.

47:20.457 --> 47:21.958
<i>Monsieur</i> Conroy, please.

47:23.659 --> 47:25.323
Ow. Uh...

47:25.325 --> 47:27.023
- Sorry. Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

47:27.025 --> 47:28.390
It is for Stubby.

47:28.392 --> 47:30.990
We made it for him
to keep him warm

47:30.992 --> 47:33.591
and to say thank you
for the day of the gas.

47:33.891 --> 47:37.524
Ah. Gee, thank you.
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

47:42.524 --> 47:45.558
Stubby, what do you say
to this nice lady?

47:47.091 --> 47:49.756
No, no, not like that. You know.

47:52.992 --> 47:55.892
You are such
a clever little dog, Stubby.

47:56.158 --> 47:57.556
Oh, I forgot.

47:57.558 --> 48:01.391
I have something for Stubby
my sergeant made for him.

48:03.092 --> 48:05.590
Don't be like that,
my little friend.

48:05.592 --> 48:07.625
This will save your life.

48:12.658 --> 48:15.659
Thank you, Gaston.
And thank you again, ma'am.

48:16.558 --> 48:19.223
Goodbye, Stubby and...

48:19.225 --> 48:20.592
<i>Monsieur</i> Conroy.

48:22.059 --> 48:25.723
- Take good care of yourselves.
- We'll take care of one another.

48:25.725 --> 48:27.890
<i>Oui, comme
les Trois Mousquetaires.</i>

48:27.892 --> 48:28.892
All for one...

48:29.259 --> 48:30.692
...and one for all!

48:32.825 --> 48:37.257
Well, well, I think
it's you she likes, Conroy, no?

48:44.793 --> 48:46.890
<i>Robert, Stubby and Gaston</i>

48:46.892 --> 48:48.890
<i>spent the next few months
in the Sibille trench,</i>

48:48.892 --> 48:51.057
<i>right in the path
of the German advance</i>

48:51.059 --> 48:53.927
<i>as they desperately tried
to move on Paris.</i>

48:55.592 --> 48:59.226
<i>Every soldier, cook and medic
took part in the fight.</i>

48:59.959 --> 49:03.391
<i>I had no idea that Seicheprey
would be described</i>

49:03.393 --> 49:05.590
<i>as the single largest
American battle</i>

49:05.592 --> 49:07.059
<i>of World War One.</i>

49:07.525 --> 49:09.693
<i>And my poor kid brother
and his dog</i>

49:10.059 --> 49:12.525
<i>were smack dab in the middle
of it all.</i>

49:13.394 --> 49:15.326
A welcome sight you are, Stubby.

49:16.060 --> 49:18.493
Whoa, whoa, whoa there, fella.

49:18.992 --> 49:21.159
I think
he remembers you, Colonel, sir.

49:21.959 --> 49:24.657
Now, no more reconnaissance
for the moment.

49:24.659 --> 49:26.423
The Germans
are pressing us hard,

49:26.425 --> 49:29.027
so I need every man
reinforcing the line.

49:29.826 --> 49:32.426
- Yes, sir!
- <i>À vos ordres, mon colonel.</i>

49:56.459 --> 49:58.225
What is it? What's going on?
What happened?

49:58.227 --> 49:59.626
Calm down. Calm down!

50:29.327 --> 50:31.027
Come on, come on, come on.

50:33.960 --> 50:35.559
Conroy, watch out!

50:38.660 --> 50:41.761
Come on, follow me.

50:46.660 --> 50:49.426
Now let's set a trap
for these rats.

51:00.861 --> 51:02.627
Stubby!

51:16.661 --> 51:18.727
<i>Hande hoch!</i>

51:20.494 --> 51:21.794
Drop your weapons!

51:24.427 --> 51:25.725
<i>Kamerad! Kamerad.</i>

51:25.727 --> 51:27.592
No, you are not my <i>kamerad.</i>

51:27.594 --> 51:30.128
You are my prisoner.
Keep your hands up.

51:31.527 --> 51:32.961
Good work, my friend.

51:33.295 --> 51:34.627
I will take them now.

51:34.894 --> 51:35.928
Go.

51:38.794 --> 51:41.594
You're such a brave boy,
you know that?

51:42.028 --> 51:44.926
It's not over, boys!
Keep your eyes peeled!

51:44.928 --> 51:46.494
They'll be back!

51:51.228 --> 51:52.161
Ah!

51:58.062 --> 51:59.458
Stubby, no!

52:01.029 --> 52:02.095
Stubby!

52:02.628 --> 52:05.394
Anybody hurt? Any wounded?

52:07.961 --> 52:10.362
Stubby! Stubby.

52:10.995 --> 52:15.360
Stubby! Oh, come on. Stubby?
You'll be okay. Come on.

52:15.362 --> 52:16.559
Come on, come on, come on.

52:16.561 --> 52:18.827
You'll be okay,
you're gonna be okay. Come on.

52:22.296 --> 52:24.328
Alright. Come on, Stubby!

52:24.995 --> 52:27.862
Please stay with me.
Come on. Please stay with me.

52:30.195 --> 52:31.692
Schroeder, Schroeder,

52:31.694 --> 52:33.459
d'you see
what that dumb dog did?

52:33.461 --> 52:34.826
He saved my life.

52:34.828 --> 52:37.394
- We need a medic now!
- D'you hear me, Schroeder?

52:37.396 --> 52:39.726
Wounded man here!

52:39.728 --> 52:41.726
Quickly, we need help!
Anybody!

52:41.728 --> 52:44.493
It's gonna be okay, boy.
I promise. I promise.

53:02.863 --> 53:04.195
Hey, Conroy.

53:07.162 --> 53:08.328
Stubby.

53:08.330 --> 53:10.495
Stubby,
what have they done to you?

53:11.030 --> 53:12.096
Come on.

53:14.528 --> 53:18.860
- Doc! Doc, Stubby needs help.
- That's a bad wound.

53:18.862 --> 53:20.526
I don't know
if there's much we can do,

53:20.528 --> 53:22.459
and he's a dog, soldier.
I'm sorry.

53:22.461 --> 53:24.963
He's my friend, he's one of us!

53:25.329 --> 53:28.995
He saved lives.
Please. Please, Doc.

53:29.795 --> 53:30.663
Please.

53:31.063 --> 53:33.894
I'm sure the doctor
will do his best.

53:33.896 --> 53:35.028
Right, Doc? Hm?

53:35.030 --> 53:37.930
Okay, okay.
Just lay him on the ambulance.

53:43.330 --> 53:45.528
You come back soon, little dog.

53:46.130 --> 53:48.030
We need our third musketeer.

53:48.996 --> 53:53.063
Guys, make way! Move!
Alright, hurry, hurry!

53:53.496 --> 53:55.562
Schroeder?

53:56.230 --> 53:58.094
Let's keep moving,
keep moving.

53:58.096 --> 54:00.030
Alright, get that, yes.

54:07.863 --> 54:10.663
Don't worry, Conroy.
He's strong.

54:20.196 --> 54:21.663
Great day to...

54:22.462 --> 54:25.629
be an American, right, Stubby?

54:30.130 --> 54:32.694
<i>After Schroeder
and Stubby were wounded,</i>

54:32.696 --> 54:35.462
<i>the fighting around Seicheprey
had become ferocious.</i>

54:37.031 --> 54:38.730
<i>And the rains came down.</i>

54:39.297 --> 54:43.197
<i>It rained day after day
after day,</i>

54:43.529 --> 54:46.395
<i>turning the whole place
into a quagmire.</i>

54:49.630 --> 54:52.996
<i>I can only begin to imagine
how Robert missed Stubby.</i>

54:53.696 --> 54:56.797
<i>He must've felt totally lost
without the little fella.</i>

55:01.697 --> 55:04.997
Come on, Conroy.
I know it's hard,

55:05.430 --> 55:07.628
but you must stay strong.

55:07.630 --> 55:09.730
German attack! Let's go!

55:10.764 --> 55:11.862
<i>The Yankee Division</i>

55:11.864 --> 55:13.728
<i>was driven out
of the Sibille trench</i>

55:13.730 --> 55:15.430
<i>and the town of Seicheprey.</i>

55:15.697 --> 55:18.398
<i>As the Germans desperately
tried to reach Paris,</i>

55:18.931 --> 55:23.064
<i>all that stood between them
and their prize were our boys.</i>

55:23.497 --> 55:26.864
<i>It was a real worrying time
for us back home.</i>

55:28.598 --> 55:29.931
They mean business.

55:30.697 --> 55:32.162
We need to stop them.

55:33.398 --> 55:35.396
No, not now, Musketeer.

55:35.398 --> 55:38.131
Tomorrow.
First, we need to rest.

55:39.598 --> 55:42.695
I miss him too,
but I know the Three Musketeers

55:42.697 --> 55:45.396
will be together again
very soon.

55:45.398 --> 55:46.863
I feel it.

55:48.264 --> 55:49.564
You think?

55:50.097 --> 55:52.797
Yes.
And the good thing is,

55:53.131 --> 55:57.932
we are out of those trenches,
my feet are dry at last.

55:58.231 --> 56:02.763
All that mud and those rats...
Argh. <i>Dégueulasse.</i>

56:02.765 --> 56:04.129
Baptiste?

56:04.131 --> 56:06.528
You've been ordered
to return to your regiment camp.

56:06.530 --> 56:08.032
Grab your gear and move out.

56:11.798 --> 56:14.131
Stubby, Schroeder, and now you?

56:14.464 --> 56:16.299
So much for your predictions.

56:16.598 --> 56:18.065
You'll be fine.

56:18.630 --> 56:21.098
Before I leave,
just take my advice.

56:21.564 --> 56:24.631
To stay alive,
you need to feel fear.

56:25.332 --> 56:26.462
Fear?

56:26.464 --> 56:28.596
But you show no fear.
You laugh!

56:28.598 --> 56:30.130
You mean this?

56:31.665 --> 56:34.798
It only protects
my fragile heart.

56:38.564 --> 56:40.731
Farewell, my good friend.

56:41.532 --> 56:43.198
Until we meet again.

56:44.998 --> 56:46.097
<i>Adieu.</i>

56:46.099 --> 56:50.063
<i>♪ La Madelon vient

57:01.431 --> 57:02.965
<i>Adieu, mon ami.</i>

57:04.598 --> 57:06.331
<i>After much hard fighting,</i>

57:06.333 --> 57:10.363
<i>our boys retook Seicheprey
and drove the Germans back.</i>

57:10.365 --> 57:12.163
<i>It was not until much later</i>

57:12.165 --> 57:15.765
<i>that I learned just how fierce
the battle had been.</i>

57:16.598 --> 57:18.531
<i>My dear sister Margaret,</i>

57:18.933 --> 57:21.632
<i>I hope you and the girls
are keeping well.</i>

57:22.066 --> 57:23.830
<i>I'm doing just fine.</i>

57:31.333 --> 57:33.198
<i>Even the chow is okay.</i>

57:34.066 --> 57:35.597
<i>Well, not like your cooking,</i>

57:35.599 --> 57:38.300
<i>but pretty much most of it
I can eat.</i>

57:40.133 --> 57:42.797
<i>It's almost four weeks
since Stubby got hit</i>

57:42.799 --> 57:45.230
<i>and there's still no news
of him.</i>

57:45.232 --> 57:48.331
<i>I'm sure he's being
taken real good care of.</i>

57:48.333 --> 57:50.696
<i>Gaston, Stubby and me,</i>

57:50.698 --> 57:53.430
<i>we called ourselves
The Three Musketeers.</i>

57:53.432 --> 57:55.931
<i>You know, like in the book
Mom read to us</i>

57:55.933 --> 57:57.799
<i>when we were kids?</i>

57:58.033 --> 57:59.999
<i>Well, the other day...</i>

58:00.699 --> 58:03.064
<i>Gaston was sent back
to his regiment.</i>

58:04.099 --> 58:05.699
<i>It's all going to be over soon,</i>

58:06.266 --> 58:07.897
<i>and then we'll be coming home.</i>

58:09.199 --> 58:10.832
<i>I send my love to you all.</i>

58:11.867 --> 58:14.498
<i>Your loving brother, Robert.</i>

58:16.199 --> 58:17.399
<i>Robert was always good</i>

58:17.401 --> 58:19.364
<i>at putting a brave face on,</i>

58:19.366 --> 58:21.499
<i>and I knew
that was what he was doing.</i>

58:23.033 --> 58:24.566
<i>His two best friends gone,</i>

58:25.266 --> 58:26.864
<i>my heart went out to him.</i>

59:34.600 --> 59:36.365
Come on, Conroy, wake up.

59:36.367 --> 59:37.998
It's guard time.
We'll miss chow.

59:40.335 --> 59:41.667
Conroy?

59:42.334 --> 59:44.466
Oh, no.

59:45.001 --> 59:47.734
Quick, we need a doctor!
My buddy is real sick!

01:00:01.268 --> 01:00:03.798
- <i>Was?</i>
- <i>Ein hund!</i>

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.733
He's the fifth soldier
this week.

01:00:15.268 --> 01:00:16.699
I don't know what it is.

01:00:16.701 --> 01:00:19.367
Just gotta keep an eye on him.
He's too sick to move.

01:00:19.834 --> 01:00:22.402
But he is gonna make it,
right, Doc?

01:00:22.967 --> 01:00:26.101
I don't know.
Maybe... maybe not.

01:00:26.701 --> 01:00:27.734
<i>In 1918,</i>

01:00:28.001 --> 01:00:31.565
<i>the whole world was seized
by a deadly flu epidemic,</i>

01:00:31.567 --> 01:00:33.601
<i>and Robert caught it too.</i>

01:00:34.035 --> 01:00:37.001
<i>It spread through our boys
like a poison cloud.</i>

01:00:46.168 --> 01:00:49.500
I gotta get out there
and fight. I need to get up.

01:00:49.502 --> 01:00:51.601
We're good, Conroy.
We're good, we're good.

01:00:57.135 --> 01:01:00.066
Everything's good.
The Boche are real quiet.

01:01:00.068 --> 01:01:01.933
Just get better.

01:01:01.935 --> 01:01:04.202
Mm... Stubby.

01:01:04.634 --> 01:01:06.900
Where's... Stubby?

01:01:06.902 --> 01:01:07.936
Just let him rest.

01:01:08.302 --> 01:01:09.935
That's the only thing
he can do now.

01:01:30.368 --> 01:01:32.635
I... I need to fight.

01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:05.834
<i>I was so happy to hear</i>

01:03:05.836 --> 01:03:07.801
<i>that Robert was on the mend,</i>

01:03:07.803 --> 01:03:10.203
<i>and that he and Stubby
were reunited.</i>

01:03:13.003 --> 01:03:14.401
<i>And good news!</i>

01:03:14.403 --> 01:03:16.567
<i>After six months
of hard fighting,</i>

01:03:16.569 --> 01:03:19.467
<i>he and Stubby
went on a furlough to Paris.</i>

01:03:19.469 --> 01:03:21.567
Never imagined
my first trip to Paris

01:03:21.569 --> 01:03:23.368
would be in a cattle wagon.

01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:24.601
So glamorous!

01:03:24.603 --> 01:03:25.770
<i>I remember thinking,</i>

01:03:26.003 --> 01:03:29.467
<i>maybe this dreadful war
was finally coming to an end.</i>

01:03:29.469 --> 01:03:31.436
You're gonna have to lay down
at some stage.

01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:37.202
Room for one more?

01:03:37.204 --> 01:03:40.071
- Hey, buddy, you made it!
- Schroeder!

01:03:40.636 --> 01:03:42.434
Stubby, look, he's back!

01:03:42.436 --> 01:03:45.770
Stubby, you're here!
What happened to you?

01:03:46.836 --> 01:03:49.834
Hello?
Why is it always about Stubby?

01:03:49.836 --> 01:03:50.636
I found him.

01:03:51.071 --> 01:03:53.036
"Thank you, Olsen,
for finding Stubby.

01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:54.137
Oh, that was great!"

01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:57.903
Sorry, Olsen. Come here!

01:04:16.071 --> 01:04:17.771
This looks nice.

01:04:24.871 --> 01:04:27.270
What do you think, Stubby?

01:04:27.737 --> 01:04:30.970
- You coming, Schroeder?
- Yep, I'm with you!

01:05:03.537 --> 01:05:04.836
<i>In the beginning,</i>

01:05:04.838 --> 01:05:07.835
<i>the French were very suspicious
of Americans,</i>

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:11.370
<i>but by the fall of 1918,
they loved us.</i>

01:05:11.372 --> 01:05:12.837
<i>Bravo!</i>

01:05:18.171 --> 01:05:19.536
<i>Bravo aux Américains.</i>

01:05:19.538 --> 01:05:22.337
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:05:22.339 --> 01:05:23.905
<i>Bravo aux Américains!</i>

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:27.105
<i>Merci.</i> Thanks.

01:05:31.038 --> 01:05:34.704
Come on, let's go see Paris!
What are we waiting for?

01:06:11.139 --> 01:06:13.204
<i>By September of 1918,</i>

01:06:13.206 --> 01:06:17.103
<i>we were told that the war
was coming to an end,</i>

01:06:17.105 --> 01:06:20.371
<i>and that the German army
was in retreat.</i>

01:06:23.672 --> 01:06:25.803
What is it, Stubby?

01:06:27.072 --> 01:06:29.539
Stubby.
Stubby, come back.

01:06:45.206 --> 01:06:46.638
No!

01:06:49.073 --> 01:06:51.873
Don't even think about it.

01:06:56.539 --> 01:06:58.271
This is yours now, Stubby.

01:06:58.273 --> 01:06:59.406
You earned it.

01:07:00.739 --> 01:07:03.072
Well, look what Stubby
sniffed out.

01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:05.939
<i>...kamerad!</i>

01:07:06.472 --> 01:07:07.906
- Move it!
- No!

01:07:14.273 --> 01:07:15.739
Come on.

01:07:16.773 --> 01:07:18.371
We are here today

01:07:18.373 --> 01:07:21.405
to mark the courage
of a very brave solider,

01:07:21.407 --> 01:07:24.637
who went above and beyond
the call of duty.

01:07:24.639 --> 01:07:28.073
Private First Class Conroy
and Stubby, post!

01:07:30.873 --> 01:07:34.104
For his capture
of a German spy in Marcheville,

01:07:34.106 --> 01:07:38.437
I confer the honorary rank
of Sergeant on Stubby,

01:07:38.439 --> 01:07:40.171
the regimental mascot.

01:07:40.173 --> 01:07:41.571
From this day forward,

01:07:41.573 --> 01:07:44.140
Sergeant Stubby
will wear these stripes.

01:07:44.639 --> 01:07:49.173
And for you, Private Conroy,
today you are Corporal Conroy.

01:07:53.374 --> 01:07:55.906
Hey, Stubby, you outrank me now.

01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:02.607
Gaston!

01:08:06.873 --> 01:08:10.874
For the newspapers back home!
Say cheese!

01:08:12.974 --> 01:08:14.140
<i>The newspaper headlines</i>

01:08:14.473 --> 01:08:18.006
<i>all talked about a final attack
on the German Hindenburg line.</i>

01:08:21.674 --> 01:08:23.738
<i>After the return of his friends,</i>

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:26.907
<i>Robert's letters were cheery
and full of good humor.</i>

01:08:27.308 --> 01:08:29.339
<i>He even told me a funny story</i>

01:08:29.341 --> 01:08:31.372
<i>about how Stubby
came face-to-face</i>

01:08:31.374 --> 01:08:33.971
<i>with a strange new beast of war.</i>

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:41.372
Okay, Sergeant,

01:08:41.374 --> 01:08:45.540
I'm Captain George S. Patton
of the United States Tank Corps.

01:08:48.241 --> 01:08:49.439
Let's go.

01:08:50.274 --> 01:08:51.741
We've got a war to win.

01:09:02.506 --> 01:09:04.207
That's my boy.

01:09:37.274 --> 01:09:39.072
I can't believe it.

01:09:39.073 --> 01:09:42.108
The Germans built this like
they were going to stay forever.

01:09:42.942 --> 01:09:44.808
The Boche build palaces

01:09:45.341 --> 01:09:48.307
and we had to live
in those puddles?

01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:50.439
It's over, it's over!
Did you hear?

01:09:50.441 --> 01:09:52.307
The war is over!

01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:54.006
The Germans are signing
an armistice.

01:09:54.008 --> 01:09:56.908
- Says who?
- What are you talking about?

01:09:57.409 --> 01:10:00.407
It's true!
The war is to end tomorrow!

01:10:00.409 --> 01:10:02.407
Hey, did you hear that, Stubby?

01:10:11.608 --> 01:10:13.776
Hold on,
hold on there, soldiers!

01:10:14.441 --> 01:10:17.106
Cease-fire doesn't start
till 11 a.m.!

01:10:17.108 --> 01:10:19.408
- Germany surrendered!
- When is it over?

01:10:19.410 --> 01:10:20.875
We have a war to fight!

01:10:26.908 --> 01:10:30.209
You know, guys, when I get home,
I'm gonna find myself a wife.

01:10:30.608 --> 01:10:33.572
I thought you were going
to wait until you found a job.

01:10:33.574 --> 01:10:35.307
Nah,
after all we've been through,

01:10:35.309 --> 01:10:37.206
I'm ready for some home life.

01:10:37.208 --> 01:10:38.408
Me, too.

01:10:38.410 --> 01:10:40.209
Can't wait to introduce Stubby
to my sisters.

01:10:41.008 --> 01:10:42.706
I've been away so long,

01:10:42.708 --> 01:10:46.573
I worry my girls
will not recognize me.

01:10:46.575 --> 01:10:49.142
Why can't we just leave now?

01:10:49.609 --> 01:10:53.608
Just think, one last push
and we're all going home.

01:10:54.741 --> 01:10:57.709
Well, little buddy,
we're nearly there.

01:10:58.143 --> 01:11:02.442
Just a few more hours and...
it'll all be over.

01:11:12.509 --> 01:11:13.740
<i>Robert and Stubby</i>

01:11:13.742 --> 01:11:16.473
<i>spent their last night
of the Great War</i>

01:11:16.475 --> 01:11:18.976
<i>huddled together
under an oak tree.</i>

01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:20.976
<i>A man and his dog,</i>

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:22.876
<i>unselfish friends,</i>

01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:25.810
<i>comrades in arms.</i>

01:12:55.145 --> 01:12:57.110
Drop your weapons!

01:13:39.945 --> 01:13:41.443
Thank you, my friend.

01:13:44.878 --> 01:13:47.875
<i>I never did
understand why our boys</i>

01:13:47.877 --> 01:13:51.576
<i>were made to attack until
the very last minute of the war.</i>

01:13:52.078 --> 01:13:55.577
<i>So many young men were lost
on that morning,</i>

01:13:56.078 --> 01:13:59.278
<i>but they did their duty...
to the very end.</i>

01:13:59.577 --> 01:14:00.878
We made it.

01:14:20.278 --> 01:14:21.577
Olsen!

01:14:29.778 --> 01:14:30.812
Olsen!

01:14:31.979 --> 01:14:33.545
Olsen, where are you?

01:14:34.245 --> 01:14:35.679
Where are you?

01:15:35.712 --> 01:15:39.077
Well, my friends,
we have seen much together,

01:15:39.079 --> 01:15:42.913
and now the Three Musketeers
must say goodbye.

01:15:48.446 --> 01:15:49.712
Stubby!

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:51.980
Yes, good boy.

01:15:52.712 --> 01:15:54.545
My friend Olsen
gave these to me.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:58.044
I will always think of him
when I play poker.

01:15:58.046 --> 01:15:59.347
Take this and think of us.

01:16:00.046 --> 01:16:02.645
Goodbye, Yankees,
and thank you all.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:09.345
- All for one!
- And one for all!

01:16:11.912 --> 01:16:13.047
<i>Vive la France!</i>

01:16:13.712 --> 01:16:15.578
<i>Vive les États-Unis!</i>

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:27.113
- We're so proud of you!
- Welcome!

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:41.245
- Welcome home, boys.
- Welcome back!

01:16:41.247 --> 01:16:42.513
Great job.

01:16:43.813 --> 01:16:46.147
It's so nice to have you back!

01:16:48.947 --> 01:16:50.213
Robert!

01:17:15.281 --> 01:17:18.147
A hero! You're a hero, Stubby!

01:17:33.813 --> 01:17:35.579
Stubby, look into the camera!

01:17:37.181 --> 01:17:38.981
And... hold it right there.
