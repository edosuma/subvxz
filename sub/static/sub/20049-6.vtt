00:07.590 --> 00:10.411
[theme music playing]

00:43.210 --> 00:44.245
The fuck!

00:44.330 --> 00:46.207
Man, people are trying to walk here!

00:49.250 --> 00:50.490
The fuck is your problem?

00:51.260 --> 00:54.332
-Dude, Alex, chill. It's all good.
-Oh, it's all good?

00:54.420 --> 00:56.923
You think you can run people over like
everyone else at the fucking school?

00:57.010 --> 00:58.546
-You're tripping, man.
-Okay.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.049
Get out of the car.

01:03.060 --> 01:04.220
Get out of the car!

01:04.810 --> 01:07.222
I'm gonna kick your fucking ass!
Get out! Get out!

01:07.310 --> 01:10.473
-Alex, calm the fuck down.
-You calm down! I am calm!

01:10.570 --> 01:12.640
Man, I'm so fucking calm.

01:12.860 --> 01:13.986
You don't want to do this.

01:14.070 --> 01:15.810
-You think I'm scared of you?
-You should be.

01:15.990 --> 01:17.275
Fuck you!

01:17.360 --> 01:18.816
[all] Ooh!

01:28.130 --> 01:31.702
[Hannah]
How many of you remember
the 0/7 My Dollar Valentines?

01:35.550 --> 01:36.926
[crowd clamoring]

01:46.140 --> 01:47.596
Those were fun, weren ’1‘ they?

01:48.980 --> 01:51.016
You fill out a survey,
and for just a buck,

01:51.110 --> 01:54.989
you get the name and number
of your one true soul mate.

01:55.070 --> 01:58.107
Ana; hey, all proceeds
go to a worthy cause:

01:59.450 --> 02:00.314
cheer camp.

02:00.410 --> 02:03.482
Sheri, I am so sorry,
but those hearts look like butts.

02:03.580 --> 02:05.787
-[a|l laughing]
-They do.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.821
[Hannah]
The Dollar Valentine survey
was a two-parter:

02:09.250 --> 02:12.663
Descr/be yourse/ﬁ ano’ o’escr/be what
you ’re looking for in someone else.

02:15.130 --> 02:17.257
Ana; as I ﬁlled mine out;

02:17.510 --> 02:20.638
I realized I was actually o’escr/b/ng
a certain someone.

02:32.150 --> 02:34.937
You ’0' think if my answers
all o’escr/beo’ one person...

02:36.940 --> 02:39.943
that person would at least appear
in my Top Five.

02:40.950 --> 02:42.019
But no.

02:42.410 --> 02:43.445
[crowd clamoring]

02:54.250 --> 02:57.458
I didn’t match up to the one person
who might really have been right.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.671
Maybe it wasn ’t my fault

03:11.400 --> 03:13.937
Maybe none of us can say
who we truly are.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.229
What the fuck?

03:26.660 --> 03:27.820
This is not good.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.621
Maybe we ’re more than
what the world sees.

03:37.170 --> 03:38.159
0r less.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.636
Maybe none of us are who we seem.

04:07.450 --> 04:09.577
-Stop it. I said stop it.
-All right!

04:09.660 --> 04:11.036
-God.
-Come on, man.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.166
What the hell is going on?

04:13.250 --> 04:15.070
-He started it.
-Yeah?

04:15.170 --> 04:16.376
So what are you doing?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.126
Finishing it?

04:19.210 --> 04:20.916
-[crowd laughing]
-You think that's funny?

04:21.670 --> 04:23.080
Yeah? Come on, let's go.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.637
Everybody, go to class.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.676
Show is over. Go to class!

04:35.900 --> 04:37.265
Where you going, Clay?

04:37.860 --> 04:40.431
-Where's my bike?
-I'm gonna hold onto it for a while.

04:41.230 --> 04:42.606
And you're gonna keep quiet, right?

04:42.900 --> 04:45.698
What are you gonna do, Justin?
Beat the shit out of me, too?

04:46.490 --> 04:47.309
Go ahead.

04:48.950 --> 04:50.281
I'll do it if I have to.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.489
Okay.

04:52.580 --> 04:53.820
You know where to find me.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.456
[Mr. Porter] Let's go, Alex.

04:58.710 --> 05:00.587
-[Alex] I'm fine.
-You don't look so fine.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.416
All right. Nurse?
Then we go to the vice principal.

05:03.510 --> 05:04.795
I said I'm fine.

05:04.880 --> 05:05.960
No, you're not. Come on.

05:09.260 --> 05:10.420
You, too. Come on.

05:10.930 --> 05:14.138
Was it a fair fight, or did Montgomery
pound the snot out of him

05:14.230 --> 05:16.300
and leave us open
to more charges of bullying?

05:16.770 --> 05:18.977
Which is exactly what
we don't need right now.

05:19.060 --> 05:20.436
Well, Alex started it,

05:20.520 --> 05:22.476
but ended up getting hurt pretty bad.

05:22.980 --> 05:24.607
This was in front of the library?

05:24.690 --> 05:27.102
This was down in the street,
by the tennis courts.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.695
But in the street?

05:29.070 --> 05:30.571
Which is off the school grounds.

05:30.660 --> 05:32.150
But they were on their way in.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.281
We don't have jurisdiction
over town streets.

05:34.370 --> 05:35.997
So, what, we just let 'em off?

05:36.250 --> 05:38.377
It seems like to me, especially now,

05:38.460 --> 05:41.452
we need to be giving them,
like, consequences and boundaries.

05:41.710 --> 05:44.873
We need to be protecting our
future ability to give them anything.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.790
But what about the Student Honor Board?

05:49.140 --> 05:52.098
The Honor Board generally deals
with cheating and minor theft.

05:52.180 --> 05:53.807
They're a smart group, though.

05:53.890 --> 05:56.597
Good kids. And this way,
the school's not held responsible.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.339
There's some justice and some closure.

06:04.360 --> 06:05.486
[Sheri] You okay?

06:09.200 --> 06:10.189
Did you...

06:10.870 --> 06:11.768
Did you see that?

06:12.370 --> 06:13.576
I couldn't watch.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.786
I don't know why people act like that.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.821
People can be fucking assholes.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.535
It's a school full of assholes.

06:21.630 --> 06:23.245
I mean, right? But...

06:23.590 --> 06:24.955
I don't think you're an asshole.

06:25.460 --> 06:26.620
That's very kind.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.835
And I don't think you're a...

06:29.430 --> 06:30.636
I mean, can girls be assholes?

06:30.720 --> 06:32.506
Oh, yeah. Trust me.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.216
So, yeah. You're not.

06:36.180 --> 06:38.557
Hey, did you finish your paper
for Miss Cusick?

06:38.730 --> 06:40.766
That
All About the Pretty Horses
thing ?

06:42.440 --> 06:44.726
Yeah, it's, uh, due tomorrow.

06:44.900 --> 06:48.279
Oh, shit, I thought we had, like,
another week for that.

06:48.490 --> 06:49.309
No.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.948
Well, I should probably
get to the library.

06:52.070 --> 06:53.059
See you in history.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.149
See you.

07:10.340 --> 07:11.500
Hey, Sheri.

07:14.260 --> 07:15.249
Listen, I could...

07:17.060 --> 07:21.133
Like, if you wanted to,
I could help you finish the paper.

07:21.850 --> 07:24.011
Oh, my God! Clay, really?

07:24.900 --> 07:26.060
Thank you. I mean...

07:26.440 --> 07:27.930
that damn book is hard.

07:28.150 --> 07:30.232
Like, the sentences are so long,

07:30.320 --> 07:32.060
then it's, like, in Spanish...

07:34.120 --> 07:36.862
We only have 20 minutes
before the first bell rings.

07:37.660 --> 07:39.571
We could also work on it after school.

07:40.250 --> 07:41.456
Maybe at Monet's?

07:42.080 --> 07:44.662
Oh, my God.
I mean, that would be amazing.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.455
You sure you don't mind?

07:46.540 --> 07:49.043
Not at all. I used to be a peer tutor.

07:49.130 --> 07:50.119
So...

07:54.340 --> 07:57.594
Well? Complete sentences, right?

07:57.680 --> 07:58.840
Yeah, totally.

07:59.100 --> 08:00.385
I even used a semicolon.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.557
I saw that. Mad props.

08:02.980 --> 08:04.095
I'm just saying.

08:04.850 --> 08:06.056
Paragraph structure's good.

08:06.770 --> 08:08.226
Might need some fact-checking.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.309
Seriously?

08:09.900 --> 08:10.935
I Googled everything.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.409
Well, the Founding Fathers
did grow and use hemp...

08:17.410 --> 08:19.787
-but it wasn't weed, exactly.
-Those are different?

08:19.870 --> 08:23.749
Yeah. Yeah, so James Madison
probably wasn't a mad stoner,

08:23.830 --> 08:26.742
or, uh, at least not from the hemp.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.503
But it's a good start.
I marked a few other facts to recheck.

08:30.590 --> 08:33.218
Sometimes actual books are more
reliable for this kinda stuff.

08:33.510 --> 08:35.967
Right, right. Good point.

08:36.180 --> 08:37.590
I'll get right on it.

08:38.350 --> 08:40.341
It's just... I don't know. This is...

08:41.640 --> 08:43.881
These Dollar Valentines,
they're personal to people.

08:44.100 --> 08:46.182
Everything I publish
is personal to people.

08:46.270 --> 08:47.760
-Yeah.
-I elide the names.

08:47.940 --> 08:49.476
I'm gonna assume
that means "cross out."

08:49.570 --> 08:51.435
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, well, I get it.

08:51.940 --> 08:52.929
Still...

08:54.150 --> 08:55.697
It, uh, it feels wrong.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.526
I'm just being honest.

08:59.580 --> 09:02.401
Well, thank you for your honesty.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.668
Until the Dollar Valentines _
offer same-sex options for match-making,

09:06.750 --> 09:08.206
I will continue to take them on.

09:17.180 --> 09:18.716
He's really serious about the 'zine.

09:18.970 --> 09:20.460
He's serious about the 'zine,

09:20.810 --> 09:23.096
his shoes, and not much else.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.396
[exhales]

09:28.020 --> 09:29.226
What are you working on?

09:30.320 --> 09:31.969
Oh, nothing. It's nothing.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.101
Dollar Valentine survey?

09:34.190 --> 09:36.488
No, no, no, no, no.
You really don't have to--

09:36.650 --> 09:37.651
Dude, relax.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.024
Okay.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.730
"How do I spend my Saturday nights?"

09:42.830 --> 09:45.037
You answered, "video games."

09:45.540 --> 09:48.953
Favorite kind of music,
"obscure indie bands."

09:49.130 --> 09:51.792
Favorite reading materials,
"fantasy and sci-fi"?

09:52.090 --> 09:54.376
Dude, why not just say you watch
Lord of the Rings
on repeat.

09:54.670 --> 09:56.877
I don't do that. Anymore.

09:57.930 --> 09:58.999
You used to do that?

10:00.390 --> 10:01.960
We need to work on this, man.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.425
-No, we don't.
-Listen, dude.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.556
I needed a "C" average or above
to play baseball.

10:06.140 --> 10:07.801
US. History was kicking my ass.

10:08.060 --> 10:09.436
And I got help, right?

10:09.980 --> 10:11.049
What about you, dude?

10:11.860 --> 10:12.815
How's your dating life?

10:13.730 --> 10:14.970
"C" average or above?

10:16.360 --> 10:17.236
Below.

10:17.900 --> 10:18.776
So you need help.

10:19.070 --> 10:20.150
Man's got a point.

10:21.530 --> 10:22.827
All these answers suck.

10:25.660 --> 10:27.070
Hannah Baker! Hey!

10:27.370 --> 10:28.450
Did you fill out a survey?

10:28.540 --> 10:30.246
Yeah, well, I figured why not.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.166
This is so cool.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.080
I've always wanted to set you up
with someone.

10:38.970 --> 10:40.005
Let's see.

10:40.680 --> 10:42.216
How does this thing work, anyway?

10:42.600 --> 10:43.589
I don't know really,

10:43.680 --> 10:47.229
but Prakash Agrawal in Mr. Merrimen's
A.P. Computer Science came up with it.

10:47.390 --> 10:49.688
He says it's like a proprietary algorithm.

10:49.980 --> 10:52.642
He's gonna license it to us for free
as an act of charity,

10:53.020 --> 10:55.773
and it's gonna make him
millions someday.

10:57.110 --> 10:58.270
Let's see.

11:05.870 --> 11:07.826
Who'd you get? Who'd you get?

11:12.500 --> 11:14.081
How did I match with Bryce Walker?

11:16.300 --> 11:18.120
No. Not that one. Trust me.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.158
Okay, agreed.

11:19.470 --> 11:20.676
Um, let's see... [gasps]

11:21.050 --> 11:22.961
What about Alex Standall? He's nice.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.426
Yeah, well, this time you can trust me...

11:26.100 --> 11:27.089
he's not.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.761
[Hannah]
Maybe I was stupid to keep hoping.

11:29.850 --> 11:31.056
[cell phone rings]

11:31.900 --> 11:33.891
Hoping for someone great.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.470
Why is Marcus Cole calling me?

11:36.610 --> 11:38.896
No way. It's Dollar Valentine.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.309
What?

11:40.400 --> 11:41.526
Okay, well,

11:41.610 --> 11:45.774
I shouldn't be telling you this,
but I'm pretty sure you were on his list.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.940
Oh, please answer.
We need a success story.

11:50.250 --> 11:53.572
People are asking for their money back.
We need that for the banner budget.

11:54.290 --> 11:55.336
I don't know.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.331
Please, Hannah Baker?

11:58.500 --> 11:59.501
Banners!

12:03.260 --> 12:05.467
-Hello?
-Hey, Hannah Baker.

12:05.970 --> 12:06.789
Guess what?

12:07.100 --> 12:08.920
Hey, Marcus Cole. What?

12:09.470 --> 12:11.938
You were first on my list
for Dollar Valentines.

12:12.230 --> 12:13.936
Dollar Valentines.

12:14.520 --> 12:16.147
That is... shocking.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.560
I'm shocked.

12:17.650 --> 12:19.527
Say yes, yes, yes.
Text me everything.

12:19.730 --> 12:21.106
Right? Yeah.

12:21.190 --> 12:22.521
I figured it was a sign.

12:22.610 --> 12:23.520
Yeah, but...

12:23.820 --> 12:24.900
wait a second.

12:24.990 --> 12:26.617
How do I know you're telling the truth?

12:27.160 --> 12:28.400
Maybe I'm not on your list.

12:28.660 --> 12:32.073
Hey, well, if you go out with me,
I can show you.

12:33.370 --> 12:34.917
-Says you.
-5ays me.

12:35.210 --> 12:38.418
And my dead president friend,
Benjamin Franklin, who was actually

12:38.500 --> 12:39.489
not a president.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.792
It is ready to buy you m/lkshakes,
hamburgers, French fries,

12:42.880 --> 12:47.249
anything you want from
the world-renowned Rosie's Diner.

12:48.220 --> 12:50.461
Come on, what do you say?
Eight p. m. ?

12:51.770 --> 12:54.341
-Listen._..
-Nope, no "listen."

12:54.640 --> 12:57.017
What follows "listen" is nothing good.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.141
Let me put it this way.
Repeat after me:

13:00.070 --> 13:03.392
"Marcus, I will definitely
go out with you."

13:03.950 --> 13:05.690
[Hannah]
I always kind of l/keo' Marcus.

13:07.200 --> 13:11.113
Marcus, I will definitely think about it.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.326
[Hannah]
You always seemed hire a good guy.

13:13.450 --> 13:14.656
Don't think too hard.

13:15.710 --> 13:16.859
I promise.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.029
I won't.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.752
Then again, they almost always do.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.217
Marcus, welcome to your tape.

13:28.850 --> 13:29.919
What was it?

13:30.890 --> 13:33.211
Did you want to see
if the rumors were true?

13:35.020 --> 13:37.511
Or did you just want to start
some new ones of your own?

13:37.730 --> 13:42.064
Okay, so, this emergency meeting
of the Honor Board is called to order.

13:42.150 --> 13:43.526
Marcus Cole, presiding.

13:43.610 --> 13:45.851
Courtney Crimsen, recording secretary.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.349
All members present.

13:47.450 --> 13:49.441
Petitioners, please state your names.

13:52.370 --> 13:53.280
That's you, guys.

13:54.910 --> 13:56.707
-Alex Standall.
-Montgomery de la Cruz.

13:58.250 --> 14:00.411
So, Montgomery,
this case seems pretty straightforward.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.661
-You were the one driving.
-So?

14:02.750 --> 14:05.048
So the pedestrian has the right of way.

14:05.130 --> 14:05.960
That is the law.

14:06.970 --> 14:09.040
And you were walking
when he almost hit you?

14:09.140 --> 14:11.256
Wasn't just me. Heroji Pratt,

14:11.350 --> 14:13.636
Jin-seo Yoon, Chase Parker.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.885
I don't know. They were all there.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.266
You're the one who acted
like a fucking psycho.

14:18.350 --> 14:19.510
Hey. Watch the language.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.976
And you were reckless driving.

14:21.060 --> 14:24.393
You could've killed somebody. It's our job
to protect the students of this school.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.856
[scoffs]

14:26.820 --> 14:28.526
To protect the students at this school?

14:29.030 --> 14:30.019
Yes, Alex.

14:30.110 --> 14:33.193
That's what the Honor Board is for,
to settle disputes among students

14:33.280 --> 14:35.236
so they don't spill out into the hallways.

14:35.330 --> 14:38.072
Yeah, the Honor Board,
’cause you ’re all
so
honorable.

14:38.370 --> 14:42.454
Alex, this happened off-campus,
so the alternative is the police.

14:42.540 --> 14:43.996
Okay. Great, let's make a call then.

14:44.090 --> 14:45.330
No one needs to make a call.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.000
There's no crime.
We can deal with it here.

14:48.090 --> 14:50.832
So anyone can get away with anything
at this school and no one gives a fuck?

14:50.930 --> 14:52.249
Language, Alex, please.

14:52.350 --> 14:56.172
We're just saying
that it was no one's fault.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.261
Okay? It just happened.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.300
[Montgomery] It didn't just happen.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.148
I mean, maybe I was driving
a little too fast,

15:03.230 --> 15:04.891
but Alex lost his shit.

15:04.980 --> 15:07.858
Yeah, see? I lost my shit.
It's my fault.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.811
Goddamn it, hey! Watch your language!

15:10.910 --> 15:12.400
I'm taking some fucking responsibility.

15:13.830 --> 15:14.979
Since you guys can't.

15:16.330 --> 15:17.820
If Alex says it was his fault...

15:17.910 --> 15:19.207
Doesn't matter what Alex says.

15:19.290 --> 15:20.279
But it was his fault.

15:20.370 --> 15:21.917
-No, it's your fault.
-It's not his fault.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.240
Maybe it's all your faults.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.096
Did that ever occur to any of you?

15:37.180 --> 15:38.590
[Hannah]
And I just keep th/nk/ng...

15:39.600 --> 15:42.478
if only someone else could have
had me on their list.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.549
Then maybe...

15:45.270 --> 15:47.352
maybe it could have all been o'h’i'erent

15:47.440 --> 15:48.816
Yo, Picasso.

15:50.070 --> 15:52.277
You resting up for a big date tonight
or something?

15:53.360 --> 15:54.406
Me? No.

15:55.370 --> 15:56.826
What about Dollar Valentines?

15:58.790 --> 16:00.109
I, uh...

16:00.540 --> 16:01.529
I didn't really do it.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.075
Couldn't afford it, huh?

16:03.170 --> 16:04.535
[laughs] Yeah.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.199
What, uh...

16:07.460 --> 16:09.121
What about you? Did you?

16:09.380 --> 16:11.666
Yep. Well, uh, you know my motto:

16:11.920 --> 16:13.376
no cheerleader left behind.

16:15.390 --> 16:16.880
You get any good matches?

16:16.970 --> 16:17.959
Not one.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.557
-I got Bryce Walker.
-Holy shit, really?

16:21.850 --> 16:24.728
Either you made a serious error
in the "Who I'm looking for" section

16:24.810 --> 16:27.392
-or that algorithm is messed up.
-Probably both.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.311
I'm always looking for the wrong person.

16:30.610 --> 16:32.487
I did get a call from Marcus Cole.

16:32.570 --> 16:33.730
He said I was on his list.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.610
Are you gonna go out with him?

16:36.950 --> 16:38.577
Well, he's not my first choice.

16:42.410 --> 16:43.911
-But, um...
-[Jeff] Jensen.

16:44.250 --> 16:45.160
What's up, Clay?

16:45.250 --> 16:46.239
Hey, Jeff.

16:47.460 --> 16:50.122
Let me guess: You two are seeing
Never Say Goodbye
for Valentine's Day.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.837
No, we ’re seeing
Thirty Ways to Die.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.376
You're a classy date.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.716
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

16:55.890 --> 16:56.834
What's up with you, man?

16:56.930 --> 16:58.249
How'd that Dollar Valentine work out?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.806
I thought you said you didn't do it.

17:03.810 --> 17:05.801
I thought you were gonna...
you told me...

17:10.780 --> 17:11.929
We're gonna see our movie.

17:16.450 --> 17:17.735
Well, which is it?

17:18.910 --> 17:21.151
What I meant was,
I didn't really get any decent matches.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.247
Jeff made me do it.
He's always making me do things,

17:24.330 --> 17:26.412
like go to dances.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.968
Anyway, I did the earlier shift
so I could do something tonight.

17:35.260 --> 17:36.579
I guess I should call Marcus.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.045
Yeah, I guess so.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.906
Hey, Marcus, it's Hannah.

18:02.290 --> 18:04.781
I thought about it, and the answer is yes.

18:06.290 --> 18:07.666
I get off work at eight.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.490
All right, I'll see you then.

18:18.630 --> 18:19.676
Well, that was easy.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.460
It can be.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.762
I'll do towels and T.P. before I take off.

18:45.540 --> 18:46.905
[Marcus] Okay, so...

18:47.200 --> 18:49.668
Montgomery, it is the decision
of the Honor Board

18:49.750 --> 18:52.378
that you are to be suspended
from Liberty High School

18:52.460 --> 18:54.041
for three consecutive school days,

18:54.130 --> 18:55.199
starting tomorrow.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.506
That's fucking bullshit.

18:56.590 --> 18:57.830
That is fucking bullshit.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.582
All right. That is enough,
or you both are gone.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.631
[Marcus] And, um...

19:02.720 --> 19:04.711
Alex, you're going to be let off
with a warning.

19:05.510 --> 19:06.465
-What?
-Oh, come on.

19:06.560 --> 19:09.131
-With a warning this time.
-Fucking hypocrites.

19:11.190 --> 19:12.009
Alex.

19:14.020 --> 19:17.478
[door opens, closes]

19:17.780 --> 19:19.941
It's the right amount of time.

19:20.450 --> 19:21.906
I just hope he got it. Yeah.

19:21.990 --> 19:23.776
All right, take care. Thanks.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.369
The hell was that?

19:36.050 --> 19:37.915
You tell me. Alex started that fight.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.376
This isn't the time for any of us
to be stirring shit up.

19:40.550 --> 19:41.585
Understand what I'm saying?

19:41.680 --> 19:43.136
No, what are you saying?

19:43.220 --> 19:45.461
People start asking questions.

19:46.310 --> 19:47.516
Those tapes get out, it...

19:48.430 --> 19:50.307
I thought you said
you didn't listen to the tapes.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.181
This isn't just us.
This isn't just a school thing.

19:58.110 --> 19:59.429
There's a lawsuit.

20:01.070 --> 20:02.230
Lives could get ruined.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.617
Seems like lives have already
been ruined, don't you think?

20:16.250 --> 20:17.285
[Mr. Baker] Any luck?

20:19.630 --> 20:21.461
What in any of this could...

20:22.300 --> 20:23.619
possibly be called luck?

20:24.930 --> 20:26.136
You're right.

20:26.220 --> 20:27.255
Sorry.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.050
We're missing something.

20:33.560 --> 20:34.766
I know we are.

20:34.850 --> 20:37.057
Honey, we've been through
this room a dozen times.

20:37.150 --> 20:38.936
Maybe there's nothing more to find.

20:39.020 --> 20:41.397
I refuse to believe that our daughter

20:41.490 --> 20:43.481
was this much of a mystery to us.

20:43.570 --> 20:44.810
I'm just...

20:45.070 --> 20:46.230
gonna keep looking.

20:46.320 --> 20:49.323
-Until you find what?
-Whatever we need to win this case.

20:49.410 --> 20:51.742
You heard the lavwers
on the phone this morning.

20:51.830 --> 20:54.116
They said we only have
circumstantial evidence.

20:54.210 --> 20:56.246
And they said that's usually the case
with trials like this.

21:05.300 --> 21:06.506
Andy...

21:09.890 --> 21:11.130
how did we not know?

21:12.480 --> 21:13.970
[crying] How did I not know?

21:16.190 --> 21:18.260
She was right here.

21:20.110 --> 21:22.101
And she was in pain,
she was reaching out,

21:22.190 --> 21:24.818
and we just kept pretending
everything was okay.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.863
Honey, I think we just need
to keep things in perspective.

21:29.950 --> 21:31.577
We can't only blame ourselves...

21:32.080 --> 21:34.401
or be looking for signs everywhere.

21:35.580 --> 21:36.569
Okay?

21:39.880 --> 21:41.666
Maybe we should be blaming ourselves.

21:43.920 --> 21:47.469
I mean, if we weren't so preoccupied
with the fucking store.

21:49.970 --> 21:51.801
-The store's how we survive.
-No, no, no.

21:51.890 --> 21:55.132
The store was to get you out
of that company that was killing you

21:55.230 --> 21:59.724
to get us out of that shitty
suburban wasteland.

21:59.810 --> 22:01.812
And if my parents hadn't
given us that loan--

22:01.900 --> 22:04.312
Ah, the loan. Yes. The loan.
Always the loan.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.779
If we hadn't taken that loan and
bought the store and moved here,

22:07.860 --> 22:09.987
then Hannah would still be in that giant,

22:10.070 --> 22:12.538
faceless high school
with those hateful girls,

22:12.620 --> 22:15.282
and maybe things would have ended
just the way they did.

22:17.540 --> 22:18.700
How can you say that?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.456
How can we know?

23:04.040 --> 23:05.041
[knocks]

23:06.920 --> 23:08.000
Oh, Mom!

23:08.090 --> 23:09.876
Happy Valentine's Day, sweetie.

23:10.050 --> 23:12.211
This is awkward

23:12.300 --> 23:14.552
and embarrassing, and so nice.

23:15.260 --> 23:17.012
But I'm not supposed to be your valentine.

23:17.140 --> 23:19.222
Sweetheart, you're always
going to be my valentine.

23:19.390 --> 23:20.846
It's a little creepy, don't you think?

23:21.310 --> 23:23.972
You're not trying to turn me into
Norman Bates or something, are you?

23:24.150 --> 23:27.563
You know what, that movie theater job...
I don't think it's healthy for you.

23:30.570 --> 23:32.197
Well... why are you here?

23:32.280 --> 23:34.362
Aren't you and Dad
doing anything for Valentine's Day?

23:34.450 --> 23:36.111
Ooh! No, no, no, no, no.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.861
When you've been married
as long as we have,

23:37.950 --> 23:41.534
the best you can hope for is...
takeout and some red wine.

23:41.750 --> 23:43.069
That's not true.

23:43.580 --> 23:45.411
He buys you flowers all the time.

23:45.880 --> 23:47.245
That's true. He does.

23:47.420 --> 23:48.580
And sometimes he cooks.

23:48.760 --> 23:49.749
Well...

23:50.050 --> 23:51.460
he heats things up very well.

23:53.930 --> 23:55.670
Well, I think you guys are so luclq.

23:57.310 --> 23:59.346
I think what you guys have is perfect.

24:00.060 --> 24:01.937
Well, sweetie, nothing's perfect, but...

24:02.770 --> 24:03.976
we are very lucky.

24:05.730 --> 24:06.765
All three of us.

24:07.690 --> 24:09.521
-Open your card, babe.
-Okay.

24:09.940 --> 24:12.443
[Hannah]
My parents were
high school sweethearts.

24:12.530 --> 24:15.317
So shoot me:
I st/l/ believed in romance.

24:21.750 --> 24:24.628
Thank you so much for taking time
to help me with this.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.086
No, I'm glad. It's cool.

24:28.550 --> 24:32.759
I've been working on this project,
and I could use a break.

24:33.130 --> 24:35.507
[chuckles] This book is a break?

24:36.760 --> 24:38.751
Well, helping you.

24:41.770 --> 24:43.340
I will get coffee. Uh...

24:44.560 --> 24:47.609
-Um, what's your drink?
-Um...

24:47.770 --> 24:51.069
_ Double mocha _with extra
little chocolate sprinkles, please.

24:51.690 --> 24:53.237
-Nice.
-[chuckles]

24:58.910 --> 25:00.320
How may I help you, sir?

25:01.750 --> 25:02.899
Uh...

25:03.000 --> 25:03.898
Hey, Slqe.

25:05.080 --> 25:06.786
Um, Triple Americano,

25:06.880 --> 25:11.579
and a double mocha with
extra little chocolate sprinkles.

25:12.340 --> 25:14.376
Extra little chocolate sprinkles.

25:15.090 --> 25:16.170
Got it.

25:18.890 --> 25:20.881
So, what? You're into cheerleaders now?

25:21.520 --> 25:22.464
It's you and Carrie?

25:23.390 --> 25:24.379
Shen.

25:24.480 --> 25:25.936
You guys make a cute couple.

25:26.020 --> 25:28.352
You can go with her to Abercrombie
and watch her try on

25:28.440 --> 25:31.318
pre-distressed jean shorts
and gladiator sandals.

25:33.690 --> 25:35.738
That is oddly specific.

25:35.820 --> 25:38.232
I just... I didn't think you were
the cheerleader type.

25:39.240 --> 25:40.696
She's a good person.

25:40.780 --> 25:41.690
She's nice.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.189
So you only like nice girls?

25:43.290 --> 25:44.279
That's not what I said.

25:44.370 --> 25:46.031
I just thought you were cooler than...

25:47.460 --> 25:48.745
a Sheri.

25:57.510 --> 25:59.466
[Hannah]
I waited for you, Marcus.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.212
And I just had to sit there, wondering.

26:05.270 --> 26:06.339
Imag/n/ng.

26:06.440 --> 26:09.011
Playing over all the diﬁ‘erent scenarios
in my mind.

26:10.650 --> 26:12.857
And all the wh/le th/nk/ng
that they all knew.. .

26:13.780 --> 26:15.645
everyone in the whole place...

26:16.150 --> 26:19.779
that I ’0' been stood up on Valentine’s Day.

26:22.030 --> 26:23.076
[incoming text alert]

26:27.250 --> 26:29.912
I decided to give you
one more chance.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.046
Stupid Hannah.

26:41.680 --> 26:46.299
[Sheri] So, this site says that one of
John Grady Cole's central flaws is...

26:47.020 --> 26:49.682
his tendency to see the world
in black and white,

26:49.770 --> 26:51.180
good and evil--

26:51.270 --> 26:52.350
Shen.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.970
Do you remember
Dollar Valentines last year?

26:56.150 --> 26:59.358
What? Dollar Valen... I mean,
yeah, I guess I remember.

26:59.450 --> 27:00.439
Why?

27:01.700 --> 27:03.770
Hannah matched with Marcus.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.070
Did she?

27:05.700 --> 27:07.691
Oh, yeah, right, yeah, she did.

27:07.790 --> 27:10.031
I actually told her
she should go out with him.

27:10.210 --> 27:11.825
I think she said it wasn't that great.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.535
Was there someone else?

27:14.340 --> 27:17.298
Someone who wasn't on her list?

27:17.550 --> 27:19.711
Or did she mention any other name?

27:19.800 --> 27:22.462
I don't know, I can't really remember.

27:23.550 --> 27:24.380
Why?

27:25.060 --> 27:26.596
Nothing, nothing, it's...

27:27.350 --> 27:29.090
Never mind, let's just keep going.

27:31.980 --> 27:33.106
[door opens]

27:43.320 --> 27:44.196
Hey, Sheri...

27:44.660 --> 27:47.037
what would you think about
going somewhere else to work?

27:47.410 --> 27:50.789
Uh, okay, sure. You live near here, right?

27:50.870 --> 27:51.825
Uh...

27:52.170 --> 27:53.159
Yeah, kind of.

27:53.250 --> 27:54.706
We could work at your house.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.087
Right, yeah. We could. Or, I mean--

27:58.170 --> 27:59.967
Or... Rosie's?

28:00.880 --> 28:02.507
No, no. My house works.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.716
-Great.
-Cool. Um...

28:07.760 --> 28:09.591
Listen, I'll meet you outside?

28:09.770 --> 28:10.759
Okay.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.526
[door closes]

28:23.990 --> 28:25.116
Hey, Clay.

28:25.450 --> 28:26.940
Long time, no see.

28:27.240 --> 28:28.946
And I mean that sarcastically.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.109
[chuckles]

28:30.580 --> 28:31.899
You still on that big crusade?

28:32.710 --> 28:33.608
Maybe not.

28:33.790 --> 28:35.701
Maybe I'm getting back to my life,

28:35.790 --> 28:38.873
and, you know, people who aren't
completely fucked up.

28:38.960 --> 28:39.915
[chuckles]

28:40.010 --> 28:41.625
Well, good luck with that.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.256
So you can stop following me.

28:43.340 --> 28:44.466
I'm not following you.

28:44.640 --> 28:45.925
I drink coffee.

28:46.090 --> 28:48.752
I thought you said the coffee here
is overpriced.

28:48.850 --> 28:50.420
Yeah, he says that all the time.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.227
Clay, Brad.

28:53.850 --> 28:56.227
Brad... Clay.

28:58.150 --> 28:59.014
Uh, hey.

29:01.780 --> 29:03.850
[chuckles] Uh, I'm not following you.

29:03.950 --> 29:05.099
And if you leave,

29:05.200 --> 29:07.566
which I suggest you do, you'll see.

29:13.410 --> 29:14.707
What was that all about?

29:16.250 --> 29:17.456
It's nothing.

29:17.790 --> 29:20.372
What do you mean, nothing?
He said you'd been following him.

29:20.460 --> 29:22.371
He's just a little out of his head lately.

29:23.670 --> 29:24.671
Too much caffeine.

29:26.470 --> 29:28.256
That's the kid who keeps texting you?

29:29.180 --> 29:31.262
Uh... one of them, yeah.

29:32.640 --> 29:33.550
How many are there?

29:35.480 --> 29:37.220
I told you it was just school stuff.

29:37.310 --> 29:38.220
Forget it?

29:38.310 --> 29:40.471
Thought you didn't get caught up
in high school bullshit.

29:40.650 --> 29:41.639
I don't.

29:41.980 --> 29:43.231
Then what was that?

29:45.280 --> 29:46.269
It's nothing.

29:46.360 --> 29:47.486
It's not nothing.

29:47.660 --> 29:48.649
I...

29:49.280 --> 29:52.989
I just think it's something you don't
want to let me be part of.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.071
On this particular issue, I can't.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.916
I have a secret that I have to keep.

30:04.380 --> 30:05.836
Got more than one, I think.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.345
Hey.

30:17.230 --> 30:18.265
Oh.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.221
Hey, Mom, I thought you'd be at work.

30:21.440 --> 30:24.068
I finally caved
and brought some work home.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.238
There's going to be late nights
on this one. Hi, Sheri.

30:26.450 --> 30:27.439
Hey, Ms. Jensen.

30:27.530 --> 30:28.690
How's your mom?

30:28.780 --> 30:29.906
She's good.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.322
Looks like a big case.

30:32.410 --> 30:35.402
We're going to go up to my room
to work on a paper for English.

30:35.580 --> 30:36.569
Sounds good.

30:38.750 --> 30:39.785
Oh, Clay, honey,

30:39.960 --> 30:41.029
keep the door open.

30:41.210 --> 30:43.371
Oh, my God, yes, Mom, fine.

30:44.090 --> 30:46.832
[Shen]
I think you ’re lucky
your parents are 5177/ together.

30:47.050 --> 30:48.369
I mean, it's rare.

30:48.470 --> 30:50.461
[soft music plays over speakers]

30:51.350 --> 30:52.339
I guess.

30:53.760 --> 30:56.058
I think they're bonded
by their shared love

30:56.140 --> 30:58.096
of humiliating me in every way possible.

30:58.270 --> 31:00.647
Wasn't enough to keep mine together.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.358
I don't think I can imagine
promising to love someone forever.

31:05.030 --> 31:08.397
But if you can do that,
then how can it just be over?

31:09.650 --> 31:10.856
Like that, you know?

31:11.450 --> 31:14.157
People fall out of love, I guess.

31:14.330 --> 31:15.479
Well, that sucks.

31:16.450 --> 31:17.656
Yeah, but...

31:18.370 --> 31:21.112
at least _it means
they fell In love In the first place.

31:22.380 --> 31:23.369
Right.

31:30.340 --> 31:31.580
[Clay clearing throat] Um...

31:40.230 --> 31:41.515
[knocking at door]

31:43.980 --> 31:45.311
-Hi.
-Hey.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.812
Be quiet.
Mom's going through one of her things.

31:47.900 --> 31:49.640
You didn't answer your phone or my texts.

31:49.740 --> 31:51.355
-I know, 'cause my mom.
-I needed to see you.

31:51.450 --> 31:52.348
Okay, just be quiet.

31:52.450 --> 31:54.111
-We need to talk.
-Okay!

31:58.250 --> 31:59.569
[closes door]

32:01.420 --> 32:02.864
Just be quiet, all right?

32:02.960 --> 32:03.949
Okay.

32:04.840 --> 32:05.829
What's going on?

32:05.920 --> 32:07.410
I was just...

32:07.590 --> 32:09.205
I looked for you after practice.

32:09.300 --> 32:10.585
Yeah, my mom needed me.

32:10.760 --> 32:13.217
She broke up with her boyfriend.
She's all fucked up.

32:13.930 --> 32:15.170
They let Alex off.

32:17.430 --> 32:18.966
Things are getting messed up.

32:19.390 --> 32:20.345
Things are fine.

32:20.600 --> 32:21.476
That fight?

32:21.940 --> 32:23.259
Some scary shit.

32:23.560 --> 32:24.857
Yeah, it was a fight.

32:24.940 --> 32:26.896
Yeah, Alex got hurt real bad.

32:26.980 --> 32:28.777
Why the fuck
are you so worried about Alex?

32:28.860 --> 32:29.929
I'm not!

32:34.990 --> 32:35.945
Hey.

32:37.330 --> 32:38.695
Can I stay here for a while?

32:41.460 --> 32:43.667
No, you know how my mom gets
when she's like this.

32:44.250 --> 32:45.160
I know.

32:51.670 --> 32:54.423
I'll make it worth your while. Hmm?

32:58.050 --> 32:58.880
Jess.

32:58.970 --> 32:59.959
Relax.

-Come on, Jess.
-Relax.

33:07.690 --> 33:09.601
-Jess.
-Relax, it's fine.

33:09.770 --> 33:11.738
Jess, what the fuck
is going on with you? Come on.

33:11.820 --> 33:12.889
Come on. Stop!

33:13.070 --> 33:14.310
What the fuck, Justin?

33:14.570 --> 33:17.448
-I told you, my mom--
-Your mom what? Huh?

33:17.870 --> 33:19.189
It never stopped you before.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.707
-You're a real fucking prick.
-Yeah, whatever.

I C/ay]
To me, the thing about
the story that’s so sad

33:51.690 --> 33:53.772
-is John Grady, you know?
-Mm-hmm.

33:54.650 --> 33:55.776
He has everything he wants.

33:55.860 --> 33:58.101
He's made it all across Mexico
to this ranch,

33:58.200 --> 33:59.656
and he's training wild horses

33:59.740 --> 34:02.903
and he has everything
he's been looking for...

34:04.250 --> 34:06.662
but he gives it all up for this girl.

34:07.670 --> 34:08.910
That doesn't sound sad to me.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.831
That sounds... romantic.

34:12.250 --> 34:13.456
Yeah, no. It is.

34:13.630 --> 34:16.372
Uh, but she's the boss's daughter, so...

34:17.260 --> 34:20.502
uh, being with her is dangerous, you know?

34:21.720 --> 34:23.096
But he does it anyway.

34:24.470 --> 34:26.518
Yeah, she comes down from the main house

34:26.600 --> 34:28.431
in the middle of the night to be with him.

34:28.940 --> 34:30.350
And then what happens?

34:31.900 --> 34:34.312
Well, he falls in love with her.

34:35.780 --> 34:37.316
And she falls in love with him?

34:38.740 --> 34:39.729
Yeah.

34:54.460 --> 34:55.620
[door opens]

35:04.310 --> 35:06.380

And then you finally showed up.

35:09.270 --> 35:10.726
Except you weren ’t alone.

35:13.440 --> 35:15.647
The fuck, Marcus?
I've been sitting here for an hour.

35:16.440 --> 35:18.237
Sorry. Hey, you want a milkshake
or something?

35:19.030 --> 35:21.567
I still have that Founding Father,
Benjamin Franklin in my wallet.

35:22.490 --> 35:24.117
I already had a milkshake.

35:24.700 --> 35:25.940
Yeah, I had two milkshakes.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.746
Okay. Well, then...

35:28.120 --> 35:28.950
fries?

35:30.750 --> 35:32.035
A cheeseburger?

35:34.840 --> 35:35.795
A stomach pump?

35:36.460 --> 35:37.700
[laughs]

35:37.960 --> 35:39.370
Damn it, Marcus.

35:39.470 --> 35:41.961
Come on, come on, what do I have
to do to make you forgive me?

35:42.800 --> 35:43.960
Nothing.

35:44.180 --> 35:45.465
Just sit down.

35:48.770 --> 35:50.431
I'm... I'm sorry, Hannah.

35:50.770 --> 35:51.759
I really am.

35:52.770 --> 35:54.647
So why'd you bring the entourage?

35:55.020 --> 35:57.477
You scared you're not safe
out here on your own with me?

35:58.400 --> 36:00.812
Actually, um, those guys

36:00.900 --> 36:02.731
are my unpaid interns.

36:02.820 --> 36:04.367
I have them do all my menial tasks.

36:04.450 --> 36:05.940
Oh yeah?
You give 'em college credit?

36:06.030 --> 36:08.442
Well, that's what I tell them, anyway.

36:13.040 --> 36:13.950
[Zach] I don't get it.

36:14.290 --> 36:15.871
What's his play? He's an hour late.

36:17.170 --> 36:18.205
Make a girl wait...

36:18.760 --> 36:20.375
if she's still there after you show,

36:20.470 --> 36:21.755
you know she's DTF.

36:24.680 --> 36:25.544
What's DTF?

36:26.140 --> 36:27.710
Dude, spell it out.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.009
It's already letters.

36:30.730 --> 36:32.379
[Hannah and Marcus laughing]

36:34.560 --> 36:36.812
-Oh, my God.
-Hey, can I have a sip of your milkshake?

36:37.610 --> 36:38.725
Knock yourself out.

36:39.780 --> 36:42.317
[Hannah]
And again, you were funny, Marcus.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.271
And I thought maybe. ..

36:47.660 --> 36:49.480
just maybe it was going to be all right.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.125
Is this...

36:59.460 --> 37:01.087
-is this okay?
-Mm-hmm.

37:01.460 --> 37:03.087
Yeah, it's okay. It's good.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.506
Good, yeah. This is...

37:07.430 --> 37:08.419
good.

37:11.640 --> 37:12.675
Clay...

37:13.520 --> 37:14.930
what are you thinking about?

37:18.860 --> 37:20.100
I'm sorry.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.936
Shit. I'm sorry.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.157
What happened? Did I do something?

37:25.660 --> 37:27.230
No, no. God, no. It's...

37:28.870 --> 37:29.859
I don't know.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.070
Um...

37:32.660 --> 37:36.039
Look, it's okay if you don't
like me like that.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.200
No...

37:38.880 --> 37:39.949
I like you.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.621
Ido. I...

37:42.130 --> 37:43.757
You were thinking of someone else.

37:45.930 --> 37:46.919
No, Sheri, I wasn't--

37:47.010 --> 37:48.216
You were thinking of Hannah.

37:49.510 --> 37:50.499
I wasn't.

37:52.680 --> 37:53.726
That's okay.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.011
I wasn't... I wasn't thinking of anyone.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.680
But... but you.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.486
I like you.

38:05.320 --> 38:06.355
Yeah?

38:06.740 --> 38:09.277
-Yeah.
-You think I'm a good person?

38:11.160 --> 38:12.866
Of course I do. I always have.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.286
Well, you shouldn't.

38:16.920 --> 38:17.909
What?

38:20.130 --> 38:21.529
Why are you crying?

38:23.340 --> 38:24.546
Look, Clay, I...

38:25.630 --> 38:27.507
[sniffles] I thought that...

38:27.970 --> 38:29.426
that maybe if...

38:29.510 --> 38:31.887
if you didn't listen to my tape,

38:31.970 --> 38:34.302
then you would still like me.

38:34.430 --> 38:36.557
You would see that I'm not that person.

38:38.520 --> 38:39.726
You're on the tapes?

38:42.270 --> 38:43.259
You didn't know?

38:44.440 --> 38:45.987
No, I haven't listened to them all.

38:54.370 --> 38:55.359
I...

38:57.120 --> 38:58.326
I did something...

39:00.790 --> 39:02.621
Hannah and I, but...

39:03.960 --> 39:05.450
I did it.

39:05.550 --> 39:07.757
And it's horrible, and I can't...

39:10.340 --> 39:11.216
Look”.

39:12.970 --> 39:14.961
I can't tell you what it is,

39:15.060 --> 39:16.709
and I don't want you to know,

39:16.810 --> 39:18.766
'cause I don't want you
to look at me that way,

39:18.850 --> 39:21.808
and it would kill me if you heard
what were on those tapes.

39:23.820 --> 39:24.639
What did you do?

39:26.690 --> 39:27.896
Clay, please.

39:28.990 --> 39:29.945
It's over.

39:30.030 --> 39:32.191
The damage is done, and...

39:33.200 --> 39:35.828
-I just wish that--
-You wish I'd give up the tapes.

39:37.580 --> 39:40.071
You want me to pass them on,
just like Marcus?

39:40.420 --> 39:42.160
-Just like everyone?
-Clay.

39:42.460 --> 39:43.745
This is why you're here?

39:43.840 --> 39:47.128
Why you've been so nice to me?
Why you kissed me?

39:47.210 --> 39:48.586
Oh, my God, Clay, no.

39:48.670 --> 39:49.967
I think you should leave.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.846
-Clay, it--
-Just go!

40:24.210 --> 40:25.120
[slurps]

40:27.460 --> 40:28.449
It's good!

40:29.260 --> 40:31.046
It was good an hour ago.

40:32.050 --> 40:33.256
It's still good.

40:43.270 --> 40:45.477
You know, we don't have to stay here
if you don't want.

40:45.980 --> 40:47.356
My parents are out of town.

40:50.650 --> 40:52.481
-What are you doing?
-What? Nothing.

40:52.860 --> 40:53.849
Just...

40:57.780 --> 40:59.281
-Seriously, Marcus?
-What?

40:59.370 --> 41:00.746
-You're such an asshole.
-Come on.

41:00.830 --> 41:01.694
No.

41:02.000 --> 41:02.989
Stop it, no. Get off me.

41:03.290 --> 41:04.325
Don't touch me!

41:04.420 --> 41:05.375
Get off!

41:06.790 --> 41:08.621
-Hey, what the fuck?
-Get away from me.

41:12.340 --> 41:13.546
No sweat.

41:14.510 --> 41:16.080
[scoffs] Thought you were easy.

41:19.010 --> 41:20.136
Let's go.

41:21.890 --> 41:23.300
[Hannah]
I cou/dn ’1' move.

41:26.940 --> 41:29.317
I cou/dn ’1' get up and leave or scream.

41:32.940 --> 41:35.443
Anything would have been better
than sitt/ng there

41:35.530 --> 41:37.691
thinking that somehow this was my fault

41:40.450 --> 41:42.907
Thinking I ’d be alone the rest of my life.

41:43.000 --> 41:43.898
[Mrs. Jensen] Clay?

41:44.540 --> 41:45.529
Honey?

41:46.960 --> 41:47.949
What?

41:48.960 --> 41:50.336
What happened, sweetie?

41:52.050 --> 41:53.165
Is everything okay?

41:54.720 --> 41:55.709
I'm fine.

41:58.050 --> 41:59.711
You're not fine.

42:01.350 --> 42:03.727
I'm your mother.
I can tell you're not fine.

42:04.730 --> 42:06.550
You haven't been for a while.

42:07.730 --> 42:08.970
I don't want to talk about it.

42:11.150 --> 42:12.356
I don't care.

42:16.360 --> 42:18.191
Why are you taking that case, Mom?

42:19.620 --> 42:21.611
Why are you getting involved
with all that?

42:22.370 --> 42:24.497
Is that why you're upset?

42:26.790 --> 42:28.530
Isn't it a conflict of interest?

42:30.750 --> 42:31.910
Why would it be?

42:34.420 --> 42:35.466
Tell me.

42:37.590 --> 42:38.796
Are you being bullied?

42:42.890 --> 42:44.596
Am I being bullied?

42:46.640 --> 42:47.846
You really want to know?

42:50.980 --> 42:52.811
What if I was the bully, Mom?

42:54.780 --> 42:56.316
Would you want to know that?

42:56.780 --> 42:58.350
You would never be a bully.

42:58.450 --> 42:59.656
How do you know?

43:01.530 --> 43:03.111
Because I know you.

43:04.990 --> 43:06.400
Because you're a good kid.

43:10.630 --> 43:12.666
Maybe there aren't any good kids.

43:16.800 --> 43:18.415
I have to get ready for bed.

43:41.780 --> 43:42.986
Clay, honey.

43:44.080 --> 43:47.868
If this case could hurt you in any way...

43:49.250 --> 43:50.911
then I won't take it.

43:54.250 --> 43:55.956
But you have to tell me why.

43:58.090 --> 44:00.081
You have to tell me what's going on.

44:02.760 --> 44:05.638
I can't help you if you don't talk to me.

44:09.100 --> 44:11.728
["The Great Longing" playing]

44:19.900 --> 44:21.356
You can't help anyway, Mom.

44:38.710 --> 44:40.200
[Hannah]
But through it a//.. .

44:40.880 --> 44:43.713
you want to believe
there are good guys in this world.

44:46.470 --> 44:47.846
I knew there were.

44:50.350 --> 44:51.635
I believed it.

44:58.860 --> 45:01.317
I and I
[door closes]

45:01.940 --> 45:04.408
Hold nothing as real

45:05.870 --> 45:08.156
As what you believe...

45:08.530 --> 45:09.440
Too much?

45:10.490 --> 45:12.151
I thought they were beautiful.

45:17.130 --> 45:17.949
I'm sorry...

45:19.000 --> 45:19.910
for...

45:20.840 --> 45:22.967
for what I said and how I said it.

45:23.470 --> 45:24.869
I'm sorry, too.

45:29.810 --> 45:30.674
I love you.

45:31.100 --> 45:32.556
And we will...

45:33.940 --> 45:36.226
keep going and keep searching

45:36.310 --> 45:38.767
and keep fighting
for as long as you want to.

45:38.980 --> 45:40.265
As long as we have to.

45:40.940 --> 45:42.567
Whatever they throw at us...

45:44.570 --> 45:46.060
it's you and me against the world.

45:48.160 --> 45:49.149
Thank you.

45:52.080 --> 45:53.149
I love you, too.

45:58.170 --> 45:59.489
These are lovely.

46:02.380 --> 46:03.961
I'll go put 'em in some water.

46:05.090 --> 46:06.876
Where my baby’s boy

46:07.590 --> 46:10.002
Is gonna live in peace

46:16.350 --> 46:18.557
No, its the longing pressure

46:18.650 --> 46:21.972
The longing pressure when you say

46:23.860 --> 46:25.430
Baby come home

46:31.660 --> 46:34.197
No, its the longing pressure

46:34.290 --> 46:37.282
The longing pressure when you say

46:39.330 --> 46:40.740
Baby come home. ..

46:50.050 --> 46:50.926
[knocking at door]

46:53.100 --> 46:54.215
Yeah.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.170
Lights out, Jess.

47:00.350 --> 47:01.226
Everything okay?

47:01.940 --> 47:02.929
Yeah.

47:03.690 --> 47:06.022
Is it that Justin Foley?
He do something to you?

47:06.440 --> 47:07.395
No, Dad.

47:07.490 --> 47:09.401
'Cause, you know, if he did,
I'd kill him, right?

47:09.490 --> 47:10.354
Dad.

I'd just...

Can you stop. Oh, my God.

47:15.790 --> 47:16.825
Well, you remember that.

47:17.710 --> 47:18.608
Good night.

47:29.630 --> 47:32.042
And I ’ve got faith in us

47:33.350 --> 47:36.262
50 hold my faith as trust

47:37.220 --> 47:39.302
And let’s start today.. .

47:43.270 --> 47:45.727
[man]
How are you feeling?
Ice packs helping?

47:46.780 --> 47:48.020
Yes, sir.

47:48.150 --> 47:48.980
That's good.

47:49.070 --> 47:51.356
I just got off the phone
with the counselor.

47:51.700 --> 47:55.238
He said that other boy
got suspended for three days.

47:55.790 --> 47:56.609
Yes, sir.

47:57.120 --> 47:58.781
But you weren't disciplined at all.

47:59.040 --> 48:00.029
No, sir.

48:00.460 --> 48:02.280
-Just gave me a warning.
-Good.

48:03.920 --> 48:05.239
You stood up for yourself.

48:06.550 --> 48:08.757
Sounds like you stood up
for those other kids, too.

48:11.510 --> 48:12.579
I guess.

48:12.680 --> 48:14.966
No. That De la Cruz kid was in the wrong.

48:15.050 --> 48:16.961
He could've hurt somebody really bad.

48:17.430 --> 48:19.057
And you took him to task for it.

48:20.180 --> 48:21.056
Yes, sir.

48:21.140 --> 48:23.973
You paid a price.
That's what we gotta do sometimes.

48:27.110 --> 48:29.567
Look, Alex,
I know fighting isn't your thing,

48:29.650 --> 48:32.904
and you should avoid fighting when
you can, but sometimes you can't.

48:33.910 --> 48:34.945
Okay?

48:35.740 --> 48:37.788
You showed real strength of character.

48:38.410 --> 48:39.616
You always do.

48:40.200 --> 48:43.112
We don't agree on everything,
but we can agree on that.

48:44.500 --> 48:45.660
Proud of you, pal.

48:50.130 --> 48:51.666
All right. That's all I got, kiddo.

48:51.880 --> 48:52.756
Get some sleep.

48:53.880 --> 48:54.881
Yes, sir.

Night.

48:57.970 --> 48:59.551
[Hannah]
Fun fact.

48:59.970 --> 49:02.473
I did some research on tombstones
the other day.

49:03.980 --> 49:07.188
Or, more specifically,
on epitaphs on tombstones.

49:12.950 --> 49:14.599
["In a Black Out" playing]

49:16.950 --> 49:18.906
The best one I could find
was by this writer

cal/ed Henry Charles Bukowski Jr.

49:23.120 --> 49:25.782
On his tombstone, he has engraved
the picture of a boxer...

49:27.420 --> 49:29.877
and beneath the boxer, two simple words:
