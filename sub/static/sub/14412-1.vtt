12:31.950 --> 12:33.953
even though you're sitting
right next to each other

12:35.019 --> 12:36.087
and said it out loud?

12:37.589 --> 12:39.458
I just sent these
emojis to Scotty.

12:39.490 --> 12:41.793
The hand-up girl
and cheeseburger?

12:42.894 --> 12:44.495
Could you be more desperate?

12:44.528 --> 12:45.998
He'll know what it means.

12:47.264 --> 12:49.268
I am not hiring
a stupid DJ!

12:50.302 --> 12:54.139
Everybody just write a haiku
about... whatever.

12:54.172 --> 12:55.240
[door closes]

12:58.375 --> 13:00.411
We have time.
Let's do this.

13:01.513 --> 13:03.148
Do what?

13:03.181 --> 13:05.350
Set the game plan
for lunch, obvs.

13:06.418 --> 13:09.187
Okay. Here's the quad.

13:09.221 --> 13:12.024
The round tables over there
are our best bet.

13:12.057 --> 13:15.860
That way we can watch the hots
without a trying-too-hard vibe.

13:15.894 --> 13:17.296
The hots?

13:17.328 --> 13:18.896
The popular crowd.

13:18.929 --> 13:20.565
Were you home-schooled
or something?

13:20.599 --> 13:24.903
No, I just never
thought of this stuff
until... recently.

13:25.937 --> 13:28.874
Well this is junior high.
You better start caring.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.910
Do you care?

13:31.942 --> 13:33.110
A little.

13:33.144 --> 13:36.514
We just need to make sure
we're not near the trash cans,

13:36.548 --> 13:38.216
so we won't
get mistaken for--

13:38.250 --> 13:40.152
Let me guess. The nots?

13:40.184 --> 13:42.487
What are you? I mean, me?

13:43.554 --> 13:45.156
What are we?

13:45.190 --> 13:47.526
We're all "normals"
for the first few days,

13:47.558 --> 13:49.627
until we prove
we're not "nots."

13:49.660 --> 13:51.262
And future hots.

13:52.397 --> 13:53.532
This is the one.

13:54.532 --> 13:56.035
It's so beautiful.

13:57.369 --> 14:00.572
This is probably
the most important moment
of our entire lives.

14:00.605 --> 14:03.241
Jessica, are you helping us
with this or not?

14:03.274 --> 14:04.610
Of course. I'm just
looking for my friend--

There! Right there!

14:24.528 --> 14:28.366
That's our spot!

Great work, everyone.

14:42.413 --> 14:45.182
You're fast.
I guess you're in.

14:45.216 --> 14:47.552
Wait, you mean
I wasn't already?

14:47.585 --> 14:49.889
Better not ask
too many questions.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.326
[Manda]
What's the matter?

14:55.360 --> 14:57.329
I know one of those girls.

14:57.361 --> 15:01.399
Her name is Dori.
We were best friends
from first to fourth grade.

15:01.432 --> 15:03.335
Then she moved schools.

15:03.368 --> 15:05.037
I feel bad now.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.372
Maybe we can invite her
over here.

15:07.404 --> 15:10.208
Bless your heart,
aren't you nice to offer?

15:11.475 --> 15:13.245
-So...
-I think...

15:14.312 --> 15:15.346
Not.

15:17.749 --> 15:21.119
Okay. Well, at least
I have to save a seat
for my best friend Bridget.

15:21.152 --> 15:23.355
She's was really nervous
about lunch.

15:23.388 --> 15:25.090

get that switched.

was bake and laugh.

tomorrow, right?

vintage concert t-shirts...

gross old shirts from college

for cheer team car washes.

they looked familiar.

How could you miss this?

21:39.364 --> 21:42.033
Maybe I was blinded
by all the bling.

So, when you said,
wear something different
every day,

21:51.776 --> 21:54.612
you meant different
meaning "not the same."

21:54.644 --> 21:56.847
Not different
meaning "unusual."

21:57.949 --> 21:59.750
How are we even related?

21:59.784 --> 22:02.954
It's your fault!
Why didn't you just tell me
what you meant?

a freakin' journey
of freakin' discovery.

gone back to the mall
to pick up a few things.

24:58.628 --> 25:01.031
I have a gazillion reasons
why I'm not trying out.

25:01.065 --> 25:05.169
One, I have coding class.
Two, I can't do a cartwheel.

25:05.201 --> 25:07.172
Three, just no.

25:08.772 --> 25:11.876
I'm sure anyone
can do a cartwheel
if they try.

25:13.009 --> 25:14.144
Can't they?

25:14.178 --> 25:17.715
Jessica. Jessica.
Guess who is
on the tryout list!

25:17.748 --> 25:20.218
The only names that matter.
Mine and Sara's.

25:22.118 --> 25:23.620
No.

25:23.653 --> 25:25.789
Dori Sipowitz!

25:25.823 --> 25:27.725
Did you know she went here?

25:27.758 --> 25:29.894
Actually, I think
she's sitting--

25:29.926 --> 25:31.061
[Manda]
Jessica.

25:33.730 --> 25:36.734
There she is!
I'm gonna to go ask her
to sit with us.

25:38.134 --> 25:40.872
Wait, did you know
she was there
the whole time?

25:42.707 --> 25:44.709
I... I just wasn't sure
it was her.

25:45.776 --> 25:47.178
Well, it is! Come on!

25:48.980 --> 25:50.548
I feel like such a jerk.

25:56.988 --> 25:59.691
That was weird.
She totally took off.

26:01.092 --> 26:02.326
Guess she didn't
recognize us.

26:04.161 --> 26:05.596
I know I don't.

26:12.103 --> 26:15.273
The cut's way too jagged.
The consistency is not right.

26:15.306 --> 26:16.274
Nice try though.

26:18.375 --> 26:19.943
He's good.

26:19.977 --> 26:21.012
Hey, I know.

26:21.045 --> 26:23.181
Maybe you should actually
watch the safety video

26:23.213 --> 26:25.716
so that doesn't
happen to you in real life.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.685
Nah, if I want to see carnage,
I'll watch
the cheer team tryouts.

26:28.719 --> 26:29.821
Good luck, by the way.

26:30.921 --> 26:33.290
How do you know
I was trying out?

26:33.324 --> 26:34.960
'Cause you hang
with the wannabes.

26:36.027 --> 26:38.062
That's what we're called?

26:38.095 --> 26:39.264
Depends who you ask.

26:41.932 --> 26:43.300
[girls talking indistinctly]

26:50.141 --> 26:53.076
Look who I found.
It's Dori.

26:53.109 --> 26:55.979
The Gleesome Threesome
are back together.

26:56.012 --> 26:57.314
Hi, Jess.

26:57.347 --> 27:00.317
Hey, it really was you.
I wasn't sure.

27:01.419 --> 27:03.888
I didn't know
you were into cheerleading.

27:03.921 --> 27:07.659
Yeah.
I've been doing gymnastics
ever since we moved.

27:07.692 --> 27:10.193
Remember when
we were too scared
to do a cartwheel?

27:10.227 --> 27:11.729
[laughing nervously]

27:11.761 --> 27:13.865
Yep. We were pretty lame.

27:15.098 --> 27:16.833
Where are Manda and Sara?

27:16.866 --> 27:20.003
Hello, ladies!
I'm Miss Garcia.

27:20.037 --> 27:21.773
[girls whooping]

27:21.806 --> 27:22.807
Woo!

27:23.874 --> 27:25.308
Excuse me, Miss Garcia.

27:25.342 --> 27:27.378
Sorry. Reserved.

27:27.411 --> 27:28.813
Cheer team tryouts.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.449
Well, ladies,
we're on the move.

27:31.481 --> 27:34.384
It looks like
we're off-roading. Again.

27:34.417 --> 27:36.887
Hopefully we won't
see any snakes.

27:36.921 --> 27:37.922
Hut-hut!

27:39.022 --> 27:42.759
Ladies, the word awesome

27:42.792 --> 27:46.363
means to inspire awe.

27:47.431 --> 27:49.967
And that's what we do here
on the Westside cheer team.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.836
We make the impossible...

27:52.869 --> 27:54.137
possible!

27:54.171 --> 27:56.207
[girls cheering]

27:56.240 --> 27:57.909
Stomping our feet
is impossible?

27:57.942 --> 27:59.477
[shushing]

27:59.509 --> 28:01.712
A-W-E...

28:01.746 --> 28:03.448
S-O-M-E!

28:03.480 --> 28:05.282
Awesome!

28:05.316 --> 28:07.285
Awesome!

28:07.317 --> 28:09.220
Awesome are we!

28:09.252 --> 28:11.188
[girls whooping]

28:12.455 --> 28:14.324
Try to do it with us.

28:14.357 --> 28:15.492
I am.

28:15.526 --> 28:17.862
[Miss Garcia]
We inspire the uninspired.

28:17.894 --> 28:20.731
We motivate the unmotivated.

28:21.932 --> 28:25.937
We make believers
out of unbelievers.

28:25.970 --> 28:27.404
Disbelievers. Whatever...

28:27.438 --> 28:28.473
I have to go.

28:29.807 --> 28:31.142
[Bridget]
I understand.

28:31.174 --> 28:34.811
[Miss Garcia]
Okay, girls, let's line up.
Shortest to tallest.

28:34.845 --> 28:36.814
[Sara and Manda laughing]

28:36.846 --> 28:39.783
Five minutes late,
50 push-ups. Now.

28:45.088 --> 28:46.857
What are your names?

28:46.891 --> 28:49.527
-Manda Powers.
-Sara D'Abruzzi.

28:49.559 --> 28:53.298
Well, Manda Powers,
Sara D'Abruzzi,

28:54.298 --> 28:55.834
you may go.

28:59.403 --> 29:01.204
You're kidding, right?

29:01.238 --> 29:03.141
But we're barely even late.

29:03.173 --> 29:06.042
And the only reason
we were barely even late

29:06.076 --> 29:08.045
is because of all this
awesome cheer flair.

29:08.077 --> 29:11.481
Yeah! You don't see
anyone else rocking
so much school spirit.

29:11.515 --> 29:14.519
No, because
they followed directions

29:14.551 --> 29:17.454
and wore what it said to wear
in the sign-up packet.

29:17.488 --> 29:19.323
Who's ready
to be a cheer champ?

29:19.355 --> 29:21.092
[girls whooping]

29:23.294 --> 29:24.829
Not you.

29:27.998 --> 29:29.066
[huffing]

29:29.098 --> 29:30.367
This is all your fault.

29:31.602 --> 29:33.070
You!

29:33.103 --> 29:36.307
You're Bethany Darling's
little sister.

29:37.441 --> 29:40.545
I'd recognize
that special cheer-itude
anywhere!

29:40.577 --> 29:42.480
You're a mini Bethany,

29:42.512 --> 29:46.416
and future cheer team captain
if I ever saw one!

29:46.450 --> 29:48.519
Wow. Thanks.

29:48.551 --> 29:53.123
But I'm not Bethany's sister.
That's Bethany's sister.
Jessica.

29:55.526 --> 29:57.428
Of course.

29:58.494 --> 30:01.531
You're Jessica Darling.

30:01.565 --> 30:03.500
I see the resemblance.

30:04.567 --> 30:08.839
So... Jessica Darling...

30:08.873 --> 30:09.874
show us what you got.

30:10.941 --> 30:12.343
Actually, I was just leaving--

30:13.376 --> 30:14.945
That's hilarious!

30:16.079 --> 30:18.817
Come on. Now, show us
that Westside spirit.

30:19.916 --> 30:22.118
Show us what you've got.

30:22.152 --> 30:24.355
Show us what you've got.

30:24.387 --> 30:26.557
Show us what you've got.

30:26.589 --> 30:28.625
Show us what you've got...

30:28.659 --> 30:31.596
Okay. I can do this.

30:31.628 --> 30:33.563
It's just physics.

30:33.596 --> 30:35.900
Motion, mass and momentum!

30:36.933 --> 30:38.635
I've got this.

30:38.669 --> 30:44.075
Be... aggressive!
Be, be, aggressive!

30:44.107 --> 30:45.275
[shrieking]

30:48.378 --> 30:49.480
[girls laughing]

30:55.920 --> 31:00.024
Maybe you should go...
and see Nurse Fleet.

31:01.191 --> 31:03.361
Yes. I should definitely go.

31:07.096 --> 31:08.432
Anywhere else.

31:08.464 --> 31:09.500
That would be best.

31:10.667 --> 31:12.335
I'll go with her.

31:12.368 --> 31:15.472
No. You need to cheer
for both of us now.

31:15.506 --> 31:18.643
Go be awe... some.

31:21.945 --> 31:23.047
Thanks, Jess.

31:25.648 --> 31:26.783
You did it!

31:26.817 --> 31:30.054
Humiliated myself
in front of every girl
in school?

31:30.086 --> 31:31.923
Yes, I know.

31:31.955 --> 31:32.990
What're you talking about?

31:33.023 --> 31:35.559
You made the team!
Sherri Garcia just called me.

31:36.559 --> 31:40.563
I'm 100% certain
that's a mistake,

31:40.596 --> 31:43.533
or I'm sucked into
an alternate dimension.

31:43.567 --> 31:46.170
Okay, then why did she tell me
to tell you

31:46.202 --> 31:50.208
to meet her at the gym
before school tomorrow
for a fitting?

31:51.275 --> 31:52.477
Really?

31:54.144 --> 31:57.682
Jess! I am so proud of you!

31:57.714 --> 32:00.684
Another Darling cheerleader!

32:00.718 --> 32:03.220
[both whooping]

32:03.252 --> 32:04.521
Woo.

32:06.256 --> 32:08.692
I'm sure
it was better earlier.

32:10.326 --> 32:12.430
Come on.
Let's go have a cheer chat.

32:13.596 --> 32:14.731
That's a thing?

32:14.765 --> 32:16.100
It is now.

32:18.335 --> 32:19.236
So, listen.

32:19.269 --> 32:21.372
Sherri said to tell you
not to tell anyone

32:21.404 --> 32:24.208
about meeting with her
before school tomorrow.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.509
Why not?

32:25.542 --> 32:28.445
They're not posting
the official list
till after homeroom.

32:29.680 --> 32:33.384
So, now that we have
It List item number two
out of the way,

32:33.416 --> 32:34.451
what about number three?

32:35.452 --> 32:39.123
Pick your first boyfriend
wisely, remember?

32:39.155 --> 32:41.224
I have to do that now?

32:41.258 --> 32:44.260
Wait too long,
and all the good ones
will be gone.

32:44.294 --> 32:47.732
And you'll be stuck
with some dork
from the gifted class.

32:48.798 --> 32:50.600
I'm in the gifted class.

32:52.803 --> 32:56.307
So, who do you like?
There's got to be someone.

32:56.339 --> 32:58.509
There isn't anyone, okay?

32:58.541 --> 33:00.211
It's not like
I'm one of those groupies

33:00.243 --> 33:02.547
who are always salivating
over Burke Roy.

33:04.181 --> 33:06.517
Sure you're not.

33:06.549 --> 33:08.251
Seriously. I'm not!

33:09.452 --> 33:10.754
Gotcha.

33:12.221 --> 33:14.025
I'm here to tell you

33:14.057 --> 33:19.063
that what I'm about
to offer you
is such an honor,

33:19.096 --> 33:21.731
such an important
responsibility,

33:21.765 --> 33:25.569
that I wouldn't give this
to anyone if I didn't think
they had what it takes.

33:25.602 --> 33:26.504
Sorry.

33:27.570 --> 33:29.372
I missed the end of tryouts.

33:29.405 --> 33:33.176
Did everyone collapse
with an intestinal virus
or something?

33:33.210 --> 33:37.048
Because I'm pretty sure
literally everyone there
was better than me.

33:38.115 --> 33:39.216
Including the janitor.

33:39.249 --> 33:40.384
[Miss Garcia]
Jessica.

33:41.718 --> 33:44.188
You are invited

33:44.221 --> 33:48.526
to be the official
Westside School...

33:49.792 --> 33:52.062
mascot! Mighty the Eagle!

33:53.463 --> 33:56.366
Okay, now I know
this is a prank.
Not cool, you guys!

33:56.400 --> 33:58.436
This is no prank.

33:58.469 --> 34:01.404
I've been waiting
to bring back Mighty
for years.

34:01.438 --> 34:03.541
But until your tryout,
I hadn't seen anyone

34:03.574 --> 34:07.344
who was willing to put
my personal cheer philosophy
into action.

34:07.376 --> 34:08.545
Which is...

34:08.579 --> 34:10.347
Cheer without fear.

34:13.550 --> 34:15.186
Right.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.420
Thanks.

34:16.452 --> 34:19.824
One more thing, which is
the most important part.

34:21.125 --> 34:26.262
The identity
of Mighty the Eagle
must remain a mystery.

34:26.295 --> 34:28.565
You can't tell anyone
it's you.

34:28.599 --> 34:30.234
-But I--
-No one.

34:30.266 --> 34:34.605
At all. Ever.
Not even your family.
Not even your dog.

34:35.706 --> 34:37.775
I don't have a dog.

34:37.806 --> 34:41.079
Then when you get a dog,
don't tell it.

34:42.277 --> 34:44.248
Okay.

34:44.280 --> 34:47.884
Mighty's anonymity
is a 50-year-old
Westside tradition.

34:47.918 --> 34:50.721
It's a tradition of pride.

34:50.753 --> 34:53.723
Of honor. Of glory.

34:55.525 --> 34:56.527
Jessica Darling...

34:57.594 --> 34:59.597
can you keep
the Mighty secret?

35:00.831 --> 35:02.700
Of course I can.

35:04.201 --> 35:05.670
Does that mean you're in?

35:10.407 --> 35:12.576
-I'm in.
-Congratulations!

35:12.608 --> 35:15.145
This conversation
never happened.

35:16.246 --> 35:17.414
Got it.

35:20.717 --> 35:22.153
Is she okay?

35:22.186 --> 35:25.222
She's cracking her knuckles.
Never a good sign.

35:26.289 --> 35:27.824
Don't feel bad, Sara,

35:27.858 --> 35:31.262
at least you didn't fall
flat on your face
like I did, right?

35:32.695 --> 35:36.467
Come on, you don't want to
make fun of me a little?
I was a disaster!

35:36.500 --> 35:40.170
You're lucky no one took video
or you'd be so viral right now.

35:40.204 --> 35:41.839
At least she got to try out.

35:42.905 --> 35:44.474
[girls shrieking]

35:47.244 --> 35:50.548
This is all your fault
for making me put on
all that cheer flair.

35:50.581 --> 35:54.684
No, It's your fault for
taking too long painting that
stupid chicken on your face.

35:54.717 --> 35:57.187
Hey, isn't the mascot
an Eagle?

35:57.221 --> 35:58.289
Yep.

35:58.322 --> 35:59.890
-I made it!
-I made it, too!

35:59.922 --> 36:01.258
We made it!

36:07.231 --> 36:09.300
I'm so sorry you didn't
make the squad, Jess.

36:09.333 --> 36:10.867
Actually, I--

36:11.934 --> 36:15.605
I kind of feel like
I did make it.

36:15.639 --> 36:16.740
Through you.

36:20.476 --> 36:22.512
You stole our spots.

36:22.545 --> 36:24.547
What?
You didn't even try out.

36:24.581 --> 36:28.586
Well, it's a good thing
we didn't, because
those spots were so ours.

36:28.619 --> 36:30.688
Yeah, except they're not.

36:32.755 --> 36:35.893
Hey, if I did
a cartwheel right now,
would that break the tension?

36:35.925 --> 36:37.827
No. Just your nose.

36:37.860 --> 36:38.929
Good point.

36:38.961 --> 36:41.798
Are Manda, Sara and Bridget
all going to eat here?

36:41.831 --> 36:44.768
'Cause it feels like
that part in a movie when
a food fight would happen.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.936
I'll save my orange.
It's a good projectile.

36:46.969 --> 36:48.405
Yeah.

36:54.478 --> 36:57.947
"The Westside Neighborhood
School Spirit Squad."

36:57.981 --> 36:59.950
It's a new club
we're starting.

36:59.983 --> 37:02.786

invitation-only
organization of..."

37:04.420 --> 37:05.688
I can't.

37:05.722 --> 37:07.291
"Athletic supporters?"

37:09.358 --> 37:12.028
Isn't that that thing that
guys put around their...

37:12.061 --> 37:15.766
I told you
people would think that.
You said you'd change it!

37:15.798 --> 37:17.900
Maybe I was too busy
trying to find the right font

37:17.934 --> 37:20.336
after you rejected
the first 10.

37:20.369 --> 37:21.938
Fonts are everything.

37:21.972 --> 37:26.410
You think people are going to
take us seriously
if we use Comic Sans? Hello!

37:26.443 --> 37:28.512
Fine. I'll reprint it.

37:28.545 --> 37:32.282
Good. And then we can end
the cheer-opoly on
school spirit once and for all!

37:35.786 --> 37:39.722
Nothing says school spirit
like declaring war
on your fellow classmates.

37:39.755 --> 37:43.293
And by the way, what's with
putting the word "cheer"
in front of everything?

37:43.327 --> 37:46.463
Cheer-itude, cheer-opoly,
it's cheer-tastic!

37:46.496 --> 37:47.698
It's cheer-diculous.

37:47.731 --> 37:48.933
Cheer-iously!

37:51.467 --> 37:53.336
Okay, I have to ask.

37:53.369 --> 37:55.438
How are you, Manda
and Sara friends?

37:55.472 --> 37:56.840
We just are.

37:56.873 --> 37:58.275
Manda lives on my cul-de-sac.

37:58.307 --> 38:01.445
Sara's family used to
until their parents made
all that boardwalk money

38:01.478 --> 38:02.813
and moved to a better house.

38:03.880 --> 38:06.617
-With indoor plumbing.
-And toilet paper.

38:08.485 --> 38:11.021
Be right back.
Gonna go get a cheer-nana.

38:11.054 --> 38:12.789
-Too far.
-Thought so.

38:16.927 --> 38:20.030
Bridge, you are not
gonna believe what
Manda and Sara are doing--

38:20.063 --> 38:23.334
Jess, do you care
if I sit with Dori
during lunch?

38:25.402 --> 38:28.405
I mean not every day.
Just some days.

38:29.639 --> 38:31.007
Like today?

38:31.041 --> 38:35.746
There's just so much
to talk about, you know?
With making the squad?

38:35.778 --> 38:36.780
Yeah. It's fine.

38:37.847 --> 38:40.416
Glad you guys
are friends again.

38:40.449 --> 38:41.617
You can join us
if you want to.

38:42.885 --> 38:47.557
If you want, you can... help
make signs for the pep rally.

38:47.590 --> 38:48.858
I'll just stay here.

38:48.893 --> 38:51.896
I mean, I can't cheer chat
if I'm not
on the cheer team right?

38:52.996 --> 38:54.597
It's okay.

38:54.630 --> 38:55.565
Go for it.

39:02.873 --> 39:05.976
Wow. Looks like
Bridget's sitting
at the not table?

39:06.009 --> 39:06.943
Lame.

39:06.976 --> 39:09.547
I don't think
it's the not table anymore.

39:14.083 --> 39:16.919
Heard about your face-wheel
at tryouts.

39:16.952 --> 39:19.757
But on the bright side,
now you don't have to
be a cheerleader.

39:19.789 --> 39:21.891
Here we go, ditzes!
Here we go!

39:23.693 --> 39:26.764
I shouldn't laugh.
Bridget's actually
pretty smart.

39:26.797 --> 39:27.831
Hey, just wait.

39:27.864 --> 39:29.766

from the top of the pyramid...

as a kid.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.709

at tryouts.

39:39.742 --> 39:41.045
[laughs mockingly]

39:41.077 --> 39:46.717
Okay, gang, today...
we're gonna learn
to use the circular saw.

39:46.750 --> 39:49.887
It's important to know
how to use one
for the zombie apocalypse.

39:49.920 --> 39:53.891
I was gonna take you
to the lumber yard
to practice, on Thursday,

39:54.990 --> 39:58.061
but instead
we'll be attending a pep rally

39:58.094 --> 40:00.731
eating into
our valuable classroom time.

40:00.764 --> 40:04.769
Is anyone in here
on the football team
or the cheer squad?

40:07.103 --> 40:08.704
[sighs]
Thank goodness.

40:08.737 --> 40:11.808
Life lesson, kids.
Don't peak in junior high.

40:11.842 --> 40:13.177
When did you peak?

40:14.543 --> 40:17.713
I have an RV,
a houseboat, a Harley

40:17.746 --> 40:20.583
and stock in
an up-and-coming tech startup.

40:20.617 --> 40:23.788
I'm peaking right about now.

-Really?

50:08.170 --> 50:09.306
Really.

50:12.507 --> 50:14.143
Elbow swear.

50:14.177 --> 50:15.812
You still remember that?

50:15.844 --> 50:17.480
We haven't done that in years.

50:24.320 --> 50:27.190
Okay. Good.
I hate secrets.

50:28.291 --> 50:30.794
Almost as much as I hate
that stupid pigeon.

50:30.827 --> 50:32.195
Eagle.

50:32.228 --> 50:33.262
Whatever.

50:34.329 --> 50:37.266
I got to go.
We have a practice
before the game.

50:39.635 --> 50:42.039
Thanks for
making me feel better
about all this, Jess.

50:43.172 --> 50:44.307
You're welcome.

50:56.885 --> 50:58.554
Hi. Miss Garcia?

50:59.621 --> 51:00.723
It's Jessica.

51:11.800 --> 51:15.337
I heard they hired
a professional mascot
from Ohio.

51:15.371 --> 51:18.441
Man, this Eagle
is like the most popular kid
in school.

51:18.474 --> 51:22.211
Until we show our stuff
tomorrow night.

51:22.244 --> 51:24.513
Those cheerleaders
won't know what hit them.

51:24.547 --> 51:25.882
Quick announcement.

51:25.914 --> 51:29.585
Fall Ball tickets
go on sale on the quad today.
So, buy them!

51:29.619 --> 51:31.688
-A dance.
-A dance!

51:31.721 --> 51:32.822
Oh, my gosh, a dance!

51:33.889 --> 51:36.192
A school dance already?

51:36.224 --> 51:39.761
Wow, they don't waste any time
throwing us into
awkward social situations.

51:39.795 --> 51:40.829
Right?

51:40.862 --> 51:42.264
Dibs on Scotty!

51:42.297 --> 51:45.400
Excuse me?
I called him on day one.

51:45.434 --> 51:47.637
Dibs don't count
if he does the asking.

51:48.771 --> 51:51.575
I wonder what flavor
ice cream he'd like
100 gallons of.

51:54.710 --> 51:57.146
Where's Bridget?
I thought she was
eating with us today.

51:58.380 --> 51:59.615
Over there.

52:01.751 --> 52:04.254
Whoa. That's a major move.

52:04.286 --> 52:06.822
Shut up.
That'll be us on Monday.

52:06.856 --> 52:09.792
It's okay to come up
and talk to us
after we move, too.

52:09.824 --> 52:11.527
How kind of you.

52:11.561 --> 52:12.662
Just don't linger.

52:13.663 --> 52:15.431
Hey, so, are you going
to the game tomorrow?

52:16.898 --> 52:19.501
I have plans.
With my aunt.

52:19.534 --> 52:23.239
She's getting so old,
and every dinner
could be her last.

52:23.271 --> 52:25.407
I mean, don't you want to see
what Spirit Squad does?

52:25.440 --> 52:27.543
Strictly for
snark possibilities?

52:27.577 --> 52:28.645
Totally, but...

52:28.677 --> 52:32.614
I mean, her last words
can't be, "Where's Jessica?"

52:32.648 --> 52:34.751
-Guilt much?
-We're part Italian.

52:37.719 --> 52:38.721
So...

52:39.856 --> 52:41.791
What time
should I pick you up
for the Fall Ball?

52:42.858 --> 52:44.360
Never-thirty.

52:44.393 --> 52:46.262
I'll be there
at never-fifteen.

52:46.295 --> 52:47.497
I like to be punctual.

52:53.869 --> 52:54.870

than slashed, I always say.

53:00.409 --> 53:01.443
Here's some ice.

53:02.510 --> 53:03.813
Shake it off.

53:03.846 --> 53:05.282
I'm sure she'll be fine.

53:06.449 --> 53:07.817
Mighty fine.

53:09.851 --> 53:11.387
Good luck tomorrow.

53:17.793 --> 53:18.760
See you at the game, Bridge!

53:18.793 --> 53:19.862

53:21.697 --> 53:24.334
Okay, what was that?

53:24.367 --> 53:25.468
What?

53:25.501 --> 53:26.903
Burke just did this to you.

53:26.936 --> 53:28.271
[clicks tongue]

53:29.438 --> 53:30.807
No.

53:30.840 --> 53:32.608
He did that to you.

53:32.641 --> 53:34.476
I don't even know him.

53:34.510 --> 53:35.945
Why would he
do that to you then?

53:35.978 --> 53:38.347
I just told you, he didn't!

53:39.447 --> 53:40.683
Okay.

53:41.916 --> 53:43.219
Bridge.

53:44.753 --> 53:46.922
Just... See you tomorrow.

53:47.989 --> 53:48.891

Man, junior high crowds stink.

54:00.402 --> 54:02.437
It's because
the game is too early.

54:02.471 --> 54:05.307
We're just
laying the groundwork
for high school glory.

54:05.340 --> 54:06.742

54:11.514 --> 54:14.050
Jess is going to be so bummed
to miss this drama.

54:14.083 --> 54:15.385
Hey, it's her life.

54:15.418 --> 54:19.356
If you're not at the game,
like it or not,
you'll never be hot.

54:20.789 --> 54:21.990
I'm so hot.

54:22.025 --> 54:24.594
You're just having
anxiety attacks
from being a quitter.

54:26.461 --> 54:28.597
I can't do the lying thing,
okay?

54:29.764 --> 54:32.335
I'm sorry.
This is it for me.

54:33.402 --> 54:34.836
It's a shame.

54:34.869 --> 54:38.340
You're, like, a mascot savant.

54:38.373 --> 54:40.042
You're cheer-credible.

54:41.110 --> 54:44.646

to change your mind,

get to finish the routine!

to tell you, but--

57:20.835 --> 57:23.104
How could you
do this to me?

57:23.137 --> 57:25.507
You knew what a big deal
it was...

57:25.541 --> 57:28.510
And you didn't even care
if you made me,

that you weren't
keeping a secret from me,

are friends now.

let me tell anyone.

the worst lie.

you had a crush on him.

I should confront you

like you two
have some big secret?

Because he knew I was Mighty.
That's it.

could talk about

59:13.047 --> 59:14.716
was how we should thank

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:10.126
It's just...

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:12.260
This was the one class
I thought no one would care.

01:02:13.561 --> 01:02:14.829
Well, I don't.

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:17.066
And if I cared, I would've
told everyone it was you
last week.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:19.835
How did you know?

01:02:21.369 --> 01:02:25.907
You have a very specific
and pathetic way
of expressing distress.

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.976
Something in the vein of...

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:29.345
[groans distinctly]

01:02:35.516 --> 01:02:36.952
Hey.

01:02:38.253 --> 01:02:40.056
I didn't mean to.

01:02:42.157 --> 01:02:43.793
You were great. Really.

01:02:45.159 --> 01:02:47.428
I could have never done
what you did.

01:02:47.461 --> 01:02:48.898
Now you're just mocking me.

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.199
I'm not.

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:53.001
It was really cool
how you put yourself
out there like that.

01:02:55.369 --> 01:02:56.505
Thanks.

01:02:58.206 --> 01:02:59.241
[buzzing]

01:03:06.547 --> 01:03:08.850
Mighty! Mighty! Mighty!

01:03:11.887 --> 01:03:15.024
So, Jess, we're all
going to the dance together.

01:03:15.056 --> 01:03:17.125
No dates.
Here's your ticket.

01:03:17.159 --> 01:03:19.128
You're on the It list.

01:03:19.161 --> 01:03:21.996
No, I'm not.
I'm the farthest thing
from it.

01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:23.566
And I'm so not going
to the dance.

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:28.470
So, you're cool
establishing yourself
as a weirdo loner

01:03:28.503 --> 01:03:30.972
who doesn't participate?

01:03:31.005 --> 01:03:33.474
I was the school
freaking mascot!

01:03:33.507 --> 01:03:35.476
And you were hot.

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:36.946
What are you gonna be now?

01:03:38.146 --> 01:03:40.048
How about happy?

01:03:40.081 --> 01:03:45.086
So, being a weirdo loner
who doesn't participate

01:03:45.119 --> 01:03:46.255
makes you happy?

01:03:47.389 --> 01:03:51.327
Fine, I'll go
to the stupid dance.
Okay? Happy now?

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.229
It's not about us.

01:03:53.262 --> 01:03:54.330
Selfie with Mighty?

01:03:59.166 --> 01:04:00.469
Nice. Post it!

01:04:04.907 --> 01:04:07.509
Please tell me
you're going to the dance
with everyone.

01:04:07.541 --> 01:04:10.011
I don't know.
I have an art fair thing
that day.

01:04:11.079 --> 01:04:14.550
Also, I'm pretty sure
the dance is gonna be
just like lunch, except with...

01:04:14.583 --> 01:04:16.152
[mimicking techno beats]

01:04:17.686 --> 01:04:20.489
And you still kind of suck
for not telling me
you were Mighty.

01:04:27.996 --> 01:04:31.300
Mighty Jessica!
So happy to see you.

01:04:31.333 --> 01:04:33.135
How's the bee sting?

01:04:33.168 --> 01:04:34.637
-Swollen.
-Your head?

01:04:35.704 --> 01:04:38.974
Physically, just a bump.

01:04:39.007 --> 01:04:40.041
Mentally...

01:04:41.409 --> 01:04:46.080
Everyone thinks
I'm a lying, boy-stealing,
feather-wearing joke.

01:04:46.114 --> 01:04:49.117
All because
I listened to my sister
and her stupid rules.

01:04:50.184 --> 01:04:52.987
I'm basically having
the worst start
to junior high

01:04:53.021 --> 01:04:54.457
anyone can possibly have.

01:04:55.724 --> 01:04:58.027
I think I'm going to transfer
to a different school.

01:04:59.094 --> 01:05:00.496
In a different state.

01:05:00.528 --> 01:05:03.331
Jessica, the buzz
will die down soon enough.

01:05:04.432 --> 01:05:05.701
Is that a bee joke?

01:05:05.733 --> 01:05:08.938
Sorry. Didn't mean
to "bee" insensitive.

01:05:10.438 --> 01:05:12.307
Okay, that was one.

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.275
Aren't you
supposed to help me?

01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:19.014
I'm going to.
Through the majesty
of cross-country running.

01:05:19.047 --> 01:05:20.449
Did you know
I'm not only
the school nurse,

01:05:20.481 --> 01:05:22.951
I'm also
the cross-country coach?

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:24.586
-No.
-Yeah.

01:05:24.619 --> 01:05:26.989
You realize how fast
you were running out there?

01:05:27.021 --> 01:05:30.259
Even with 30 pounds
of feathers on you?

01:05:30.291 --> 01:05:33.094
You've got raw talent,
young lady.

01:05:33.128 --> 01:05:36.465
Come to practice tomorrow
after school.
You won't be sorry.

01:05:36.498 --> 01:05:39.068
Can I get out of it
with a note
from the school nurse?

01:05:40.101 --> 01:05:41.469
Just think about it.

01:05:45.172 --> 01:05:46.408
[cellphone chimes]

01:05:57.251 --> 01:05:59.989
Mom, I need to
go to the mall!

01:06:01.188 --> 01:06:02.557
For a dress for the dance?

01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:05.460
Make-up? Skirts?
Strappy sandals?

01:06:06.561 --> 01:06:07.963
Running shoes.

01:06:11.565 --> 01:06:14.269
Maybe you can get some
in cute colors?

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:17.039
Sure.

01:06:19.273 --> 01:06:22.677
All right, ladies,
let's settle up on the line.
On the line. Okay.

01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:25.113
Ladies, let's welcome
Jessica Darling

01:06:25.146 --> 01:06:28.282
to the Westside
Neighborhood School
cross-country team.

01:06:28.315 --> 01:06:29.518
Actually, I haven't decided--

01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:31.253
Run now, talk later.

01:06:31.286 --> 01:06:33.556
All right, warm up. One mile.

01:06:34.755 --> 01:06:38.259
It's four laps.
Here we go. And...

01:06:38.293 --> 01:06:39.295
[blows whistle]

01:06:41.797 --> 01:06:45.099
Not bad, not bad at all.

01:06:45.132 --> 01:06:47.568
And that was just a warm-up
without a bee in your bonnet.

01:06:47.601 --> 01:06:49.637
So, how long
have you been running for?

01:06:50.838 --> 01:06:52.740
About seven minutes.

01:06:52.773 --> 01:06:54.476
No, I mean, as a sport.

01:06:56.143 --> 01:06:57.178
About seven minutes.

01:06:58.346 --> 01:07:00.681
Ladies, I think
we finally have
our fourth team member.

01:07:00.715 --> 01:07:03.184
No more forfeits!
We're legit, baby!

01:07:03.217 --> 01:07:05.721
[all whooping]

01:07:05.753 --> 01:07:06.788
I didn't say I was in.

01:07:09.858 --> 01:07:11.126
Okay, I'm in.

01:07:11.159 --> 01:07:12.461
[all cheering]

01:07:15.097 --> 01:07:16.565
Hey. How's your head?

01:07:18.099 --> 01:07:21.670
From the thingy?
It's fine, thanks.
I'll see you.

01:07:21.702 --> 01:07:23.172
Wait.

01:07:23.204 --> 01:07:24.806
Are you going to the dance
with anyone?

01:07:26.173 --> 01:07:27.643
I was just going to ask
if you want to--

01:07:27.675 --> 01:07:28.811
No!

01:07:30.744 --> 01:07:31.746
Wow.

01:07:32.813 --> 01:07:34.715
I'm sorry. It's just...

01:07:34.748 --> 01:07:37.719
I don't understand.
You need to ask Bridget.
She likes you.

01:07:38.786 --> 01:07:40.254
You don't?

01:07:40.288 --> 01:07:41.590
I don't even know you.

01:07:41.623 --> 01:07:43.224
So?

01:07:43.257 --> 01:07:46.227
Okay, seriously.
I don't get
why you're asking me.

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:49.431
I just thought a chick
who did what you did
was pretty cool, that's all.

01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:53.335
Yeah. Now you just seem
kind of weird.

01:07:53.367 --> 01:07:56.204
Yes. I am. Very.

01:07:56.237 --> 01:07:57.505
Ooh.

01:07:59.206 --> 01:08:00.409
You should ask Bridget.

01:08:01.576 --> 01:08:03.679
Yeah, okay. Whatever.

01:08:07.148 --> 01:08:08.416
What is happening?

01:08:12.586 --> 01:08:13.855
[Aleck]
Hey.

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:16.323
Are you gonna
pick a color or what?

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:17.893
You're just staring off
into space.

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:19.127
Sorry.

01:08:20.261 --> 01:08:21.261
Red is fine.

01:08:23.698 --> 01:08:26.368
So, what did Burke want?

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:27.734
You saw us?

01:08:27.769 --> 01:08:29.371
Please don't tell anyone.

01:08:29.404 --> 01:08:31.807
That's just gonna make
everything so much worse.

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:35.777
Did he ask you to the dance?

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:38.580
It doesn't matter.
I'm going with friends.

01:08:38.613 --> 01:08:41.484
I mean,
I think they're my friends.
I don't know.

01:08:44.185 --> 01:08:46.520
I don't even know
if I like most of them.

01:08:48.756 --> 01:08:50.591
What about you?
Are you going?

01:08:50.625 --> 01:08:53.694
Only because I have to.
My mom's forcing me.

01:08:53.728 --> 01:08:58.332
She thinks I'm making myself
into some weird loner
who doesn't participate.

01:08:58.365 --> 01:09:02.171
We're all weird, Aleck.
Some of us
just hide it better.

01:09:03.270 --> 01:09:05.305
It's Marcus.

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.341
What is?

01:09:06.372 --> 01:09:08.408
My name... is Marcus.

01:09:11.912 --> 01:09:13.448
Jessica.

01:09:16.283 --> 01:09:18.752
-Mighty glad to meet you.
-Really?

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:20.523
Sorry, it was just too easy.

01:09:23.457 --> 01:09:25.926
[Children]
Berman! Berman! Berman!

01:09:34.868 --> 01:09:35.969
What's going on?

01:09:36.002 --> 01:09:39.240
Noah Berman set free
all the frogs
in the bio lab.

01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:41.777
-You're old news.
-Really?

01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:44.377
That's awesome.

01:09:44.412 --> 01:09:46.381
So you joined
cross-country?

01:09:46.412 --> 01:09:49.216
Yup. Apparently I have a gift
for running in circles.

01:09:50.283 --> 01:09:52.487
Glad you found something
you really like.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:53.656
Thanks.

01:09:54.889 --> 01:09:56.925
So, are we...

01:09:56.957 --> 01:10:00.394
We're cool. I know you swore
to Miss Garcia
you'd keep the secret.

01:10:00.427 --> 01:10:02.264
So, I guess I know
if you knew
something about me,

01:10:02.296 --> 01:10:03.864
you'd keep it to yourself?

01:10:03.898 --> 01:10:06.768
Depends. Whatcha got?

01:10:06.801 --> 01:10:08.971
I'm really a teen pop star
in disguise.

01:10:09.003 --> 01:10:10.271
I knew it!

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:14.743
All right. See you then.

01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:17.746
[shrieks]

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.416
[all screeching]

01:10:21.983 --> 01:10:23.851
Looks like
Burke asked Bridget.

01:10:23.885 --> 01:10:26.588
Finally.
What took him so long?

01:10:29.056 --> 01:10:30.692
Guys, we have to go!

01:10:30.725 --> 01:10:32.394
Everyone's meeting at school!

01:10:33.595 --> 01:10:35.463
Say, "Brie."

01:10:35.497 --> 01:10:36.532
Gorgonzola.

01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:40.668
You look so pretty,
sweetheart.

01:10:41.735 --> 01:10:44.872
That's it?
No "maybe you shoulds?"

01:10:44.905 --> 01:10:46.442
Of course not!

01:10:47.609 --> 01:10:49.544
All right. Maybe just
a darker shade of lip gloss.

01:10:49.577 --> 01:10:51.680
-Mom!
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:10:53.314 --> 01:10:55.750
Hey, Bethany, we didn't
expect you tonight.

01:10:57.385 --> 01:11:00.389
Just wanted to see Jessica
before the dance.

01:11:00.421 --> 01:11:01.656
You look good.

01:11:02.957 --> 01:11:05.627
Maybe you should try
a darker shade of lip gloss.

01:11:05.659 --> 01:11:06.729
Seriously?

01:11:07.996 --> 01:11:09.463
[clearing throat]

01:11:09.497 --> 01:11:10.666
You looking for this?

01:11:11.899 --> 01:11:14.502
No. What is it?

01:11:14.536 --> 01:11:18.373
Well, Apparently Bethany's
been flunking out of school.
For six months.

01:11:18.405 --> 01:11:19.307
What?

01:11:20.375 --> 01:11:21.310
Okay. Fine.

01:11:22.377 --> 01:11:23.479
You caught me.

01:11:24.645 --> 01:11:26.715
I'm officially a loser.

01:11:27.748 --> 01:11:29.216
Honey, you're not a loser.

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:32.988
But you're also not getting
another dime from us,
except food and rent

01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:34.855
until your grades go back up.

01:11:34.889 --> 01:11:36.958
What about
my clothing allowance?

01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:39.528
I'm sorry, Bethany,
you are just
going to have to...

01:11:40.627 --> 01:11:43.064
repeat an outfit.

01:11:43.097 --> 01:11:44.666
No.

01:11:44.698 --> 01:11:45.800
Wait.

01:11:46.935 --> 01:11:47.870
So...

01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:50.838
that's why you've been
hanging around?

01:11:51.939 --> 01:11:53.408
To intercept the mail?

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:57.680
And giving me that list
was just an excuse
to keep coming back?

01:12:00.547 --> 01:12:02.050
Do you even care
what happens to me?

01:12:03.417 --> 01:12:04.652
Of course I do.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:09.390
I just wanted you to have
a great time in school.

01:12:10.557 --> 01:12:14.462
And I thought that meant
you needed to be more like me.

01:12:15.662 --> 01:12:19.100
But clearly,
I should've been
more like you.

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:23.639
You're so smart
and funny and beautiful.

01:12:25.806 --> 01:12:28.344
You never needed
that stupid list.

01:12:29.877 --> 01:12:31.612
I'm so sorry, Jess.

01:12:35.182 --> 01:12:36.885
