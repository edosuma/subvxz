FRENCHIE'S ONLY OPTION.

01:39.379 --> 01:44.241
NOW THAT I'M GOOD WITH BRENT,

CHRISTIAN AND ALYSSA WERE MORE

01:58.862 --> 02:00.137
THAN FRIENDS.

02:00.172 --> 02:05.275
THE ONLY THING I CAN'T STAND
MORE THAN A MEATHEAD IS A

02:05.310 --> 02:05.965
TROLLMAN.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.862
I GOT TO TBREAK THIS UP QUICK.

Announcer: AND FRENCHIE
QUICKLY PUT THE PRESSURE ON HIM.

02:49.206 --> 02:50.862
I WOULD LIKE TO VETO YOU.

02:50.896 --> 02:52.172
OKAY.

02:52.206 --> 02:56.862
IF YOU DON'T GET TRAVIS THIS
WEEK, WE'RE GOING FOR DEREK NEXT

WEEK.

02:57.689 --> 02:59.275
Announcer: AT THE VETO
MEETING.

02:59.310 --> 03:03.620
I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE
POWER OF VETO ON KIELAND.

03:03.655 --> 03:09.310
Announcer: FRENCHIE WENT
BACK ON HIS WORD TO THE HAWAIIAN

03:09.344 --> 03:10.344
STALLION.

ALYSSA OR TRAVIS WILL BE THE

03:13.103 --> 03:15.793
FIRST EVICTED FROM THE BB HOUSE.

03:15.827 --> 03:19.689
AND WITH FRENCHIE'S REIGN OF
MADNESS COMING TO AN END, A NEW

03:19.724 --> 03:23.793
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD WILL BE
CROWNED.

03:23.827 --> 03:28.206
ALL THIS LIVE ON "BIG BROTHER".

03:28.241 --> 03:31.000
IT IS NOT ALWAYS SUNSHINE AND
RAINBOWS.

04:11.965 --> 04:15.000
Julie: GOOD EVENING I'M
JULIE CHEN MOONVES, WELCOME TO

04:15.034 --> 04:16.586
"BIG BROTHER."

04:16.620 --> 04:20.724
IT'S ONLY BEEN A WEEK SINCE THE
GAME BEGAN BUT WHEN FRENCHIES

04:20.758 --> 04:24.724
AHEAD OF HOUSEHOLD, THERE'S BEEN
ENOUGH DIZZEING STRATEGY TO FILL

04:24.758 --> 04:26.310
AN ENTIRE SUMMER.

04:26.344 --> 04:31.310
WITHIN THE FIRST 12 HOURS OF HIS
H.O.H. REIGN FRENCHIE BASICALLY

04:31.344 --> 04:34.724
PROMISED THE ENTIRE HOUSE
SAFETY, EXCEPT FOR CHRISTIAN.

04:34.758 --> 04:38.551
BUT WHEN CHRISTIAN SAVED
HIMSELF, FRENCHIE WAS FORCED TO

04:38.586 --> 04:42.724
GO BACK ON HIS WORD NOMINATING
KIELAND AND ALYSSA.

04:42.758 --> 04:47.034
AND WHEN THE VETO WAS USED TO
SAVE KIELAND, FRENCHIE WENT BACK

04:47.068 --> 04:50.310
ON HIS WORD ONCE AGAIN.

04:50.344 --> 04:54.793
NOW ALYSSA AND TRAVIS SIT
SIDE-BY-SIDE ON THE CHOPPING

04:54.827 --> 04:55.793
BLOCK.

04:55.827 --> 04:58.931
WHO WILL BE THE FIRST HOUSEGUEST
SENT PACKING.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.344
WE'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.

05:00.379 --> 05:08.034
BUT FIRST, HIS NOMINATIONS MAY
FINALLY BE IN PLACE BUT THIS

05:08.068 --> 05:09.482
H.O.H. JUST WON'T QUIT.

05:09.517 --> 05:18.344
THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

05:18.379 --> 05:21.517
I DECIDED TO USE THE VETO ON
KIELAND BECAUSE ONE, HE

05:21.551 --> 05:25.034
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ON THE BLOCK
AT ALL, AND THEN TWO IT HELPED

05:25.068 --> 05:28.310
ME REGAIN FAVOR WITH FRENCHIE
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HE WANTED

05:28.344 --> 05:31.137
ME TO DO.

05:31.172 --> 05:34.758
SEEING TRAVIS GO OFF AS A
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE IS

05:34.793 --> 05:36.862
HEARTBREAKING BECAUSE HE IS ON
MY TEAM.

05:36.896 --> 05:43.275
BUT I AM JUST BESIDE MYSELF WITH
EXCITEMENT TO ACTUALLY BE SAFE.

05:43.310 --> 05:44.310
YOU'RE WELCOME.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.620
THANKS.

05:45.655 --> 05:47.034
IT OBVIOUSLY SUCKS I'M STILL
ON THE BLOCK ESPECIALLY ON WEEK

05:47.068 --> 05:48.310
ONE.

05:48.344 --> 05:50.344
BUT IT DEFINITELY HELPS THAT I
AM NEXT TO TRAVIS BECAUSE HE IS

05:50.379 --> 05:52.137
A WAY BIGGER THREAT THAN ME.

05:52.172 --> 05:54.379
I DEFINITELY AM JUST GOING TO
KEEP LAYING LOW AND MAKE SURE I

05:54.413 --> 06:03.551
DO HAVE THE VOTES THIS WEEK.

06:03.586 --> 06:06.103
OH, SOMETHING FINALLY GOES
RIGHT, MY ULTIMATE GOAL THIS

06:06.137 --> 06:10.344
WEEK WAS TO GET OUT A MEATHEAD,
AND GUESS WHAT, HE'S SITTING ON

06:10.379 --> 06:11.413
THE BLOCK.

06:11.448 --> 06:16.551
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE THE
BULL IS GOING HOME.

06:16.586 --> 06:21.379
THE FIRST MOVE-IN GROUP IT IT
WAS MYSELF, X AND BIG D WITH

06:21.413 --> 06:24.275
MR. FRENCH HIMSELF AND HE GAVE
US HIS WORD THAT WE WOULD BE

06:24.310 --> 06:27.931
COMPLETELY SAFE THROUGHOUT THE
ENTIRE OF HIS HEAD OF

06:27.965 --> 06:28.862
HOUSEHOLDSHIP.

06:28.896 --> 06:29.827
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY NOT REALLY THE
CASE NOW.

06:29.862 --> 06:32.206
HE IS A LIAR AND HE CAN'T BE
TRUSTED.

06:32.241 --> 06:43.103
SO FRENCHIE, IF I GO OUT, I'M
TAKING YOU DOWN WITH ME, MY MAN.

06:43.137 --> 06:45.551
I MEAN I KNOW WHAT IS
HAPPENING.

06:45.586 --> 06:46.413
UH-HUH.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.034
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY
ANYTHING.

06:49.068 --> 06:52.724
> I TOLD HIM-- JUST FOR THIS
WEEK.

06:52.758 --> 06:55.344
YEAH.

06:55.379 --> 07:00.793
BECAUSE TRAVIS-- HE HAS TIME
TO.

07:00.827 --> 07:08.379
YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE,
HE'S GOT ME, X AND-- ALL FOR YOU

07:08.413 --> 07:09.793
TO GET THOSE VOTES.

07:09.827 --> 07:13.034
I TOLD YOU FROM THE MOMENT
YOUR FACE GOT UP THERE, YOU'RE

07:13.068 --> 07:16.344
NOT TBG HOME.

07:16.379 --> 07:18.275
OKAY, THANK YOU.

07:18.310 --> 07:19.068
YOU SWEAR?

07:19.103 --> 07:21.275
JUST I DON'T KNOW HOW HE
COULD.

07:21.310 --> 07:25.896
LIKE IF I GO HOME, I'M GOING
HOME FOR NOTHING AND NO REASON.

07:25.931 --> 07:27.000
NOT EVEN MY FAULT.

07:27.034 --> 07:37.655
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THAT
HAPPEN.

07:37.689 --> 07:39.620
OH, THOSE OVERALLS ARE SO
CUTE.

07:39.655 --> 07:42.896
THANK YOU, I'M GOING TO
OUTFRENCHIE THE FRENCHIE.

07:42.931 --> 07:44.758
THE FRENCH ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT.

07:44.793 --> 07:48.724
IT TURNS OUT THAT FRENCHIE'S
NAME IS A GREAT SUBSTITUTE FOR

07:48.758 --> 07:49.275
THE F BOMB.

07:49.310 --> 07:50.827
WHAT THE FRENCH.

07:50.862 --> 07:51.482
I LIKE THAT.

07:51.517 --> 07:52.724
WHAT THE FRENCH.

07:52.758 --> 07:53.551
DON'T GET FRENCHED UP.

07:53.586 --> 07:54.862
DON'T FRENCH WITH ME.

07:54.896 --> 07:56.482
WHO THE FRENCH ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.620
WHO YOU FRENCHING WITHNESS
THE FRENCH.

07:58.655 --> 08:00.241
WHO THE FRENCH YOU THINK ARE
YOU.

08:00.275 --> 08:04.034
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FRENCH
YOU THOUGHT BUT LET ME TELL YOU

08:04.068 --> 08:05.206
WHAT REALLY IS GOING ON.

08:05.241 --> 08:08.793
IF I DON'T SURVIVE THE
FRENCHING BLOCK THIS WEEK, I'M

08:08.827 --> 08:12.758
TOTALLY FRENCHED.

08:12.793 --> 08:20.758
FROM THE MOMENT WE WERE
OUTSIDE, I SAW YOU ANALYZING

08:20.793 --> 08:21.689
EVERYTHING.

08:21.724 --> 08:23.482
ANALYZING PEOPLE LIKE TAKING
EVERYTHING IN.

08:23.517 --> 08:29.724
I WAS LIKE OKAY, SHE'S THINKING
THIS LIKE I AM.

08:29.758 --> 08:33.724
THIS HAS GOT TO BE PEOPLE
THAT ARE COMPETITORS AND AREN'T

08:33.758 --> 08:37.034
AFRAID TO GO TOE TO TOE WITH
EVERYBODY.

08:37.068 --> 08:42.896
SO IF WE CAN GET THAT WE WILL
HAVE THE NUMBERS AND CALL IT

08:42.931 --> 08:44.068
LIKE SLAUGHTERHOUSE.

08:44.103 --> 08:47.689
FOR YEARS I ALWAYS WATCHED
"BIG BROTHER" AND I ALWAYS

08:47.724 --> 08:51.724
WANTED TO START AN ALLIANCE
CALLED THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE.

08:51.758 --> 08:55.275
FIRST OF ALL, YOU GOT XAVIER, TO
ME HE'S THE BIGGEST THREAT IN

08:55.310 --> 08:58.689
THIS HOUSE SO I DEFINITELY HAVE
TO KEEP HIM CLOSE.

08:58.724 --> 09:00.793
WHITNEY ON THE OTHER HAND, I
NEED SOMEBODY THAT CAN BOND WITH

09:00.827 --> 09:04.724
IN THIS HOUSE AND WE'RE BOTH
PARENTS.

09:04.758 --> 09:05.896
WE'RE VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

09:05.931 --> 09:06.344
EXACTLY.

09:06.379 --> 09:10.931
TO THE CORE.

09:10.965 --> 09:13.793
BUT-- THIS IS LIKE MY DREAM
TEAM.

09:13.827 --> 09:14.620
WE NEED TO GRAB MORE PEOPLE.

09:14.655 --> 09:20.758
WE NEED MORE PEOPLE,
ABSOLUTELY.

09:20.793 --> 09:25.827
MY INTENTIONS OF THE
SLAUGHTERHOUSE ALLIANCE IS

09:25.862 --> 09:26.965
SIMPLE.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.965
MY BIGGEST THREAT IN THIS GAME,
I'VE GOT TO GET CLOSE.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.413
YOU'VE GOT KIELAND AND
CHRISTIAN, BOTH OF THESE GUYS

09:33.448 --> 09:34.620
ARE POWERHOUSES IN THIS GAME.

09:34.655 --> 09:36.137
HERE IS THE GAME PLAN.

09:36.172 --> 09:39.551
THERE ARE FIVE OF US IN THIS
ROOM RIGHT NOW.

09:39.586 --> 09:41.965
THIS IS WHO I WOULD RATHER
RIDE OR DIE WITH.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.068
I ALSO WANT AN ALLIANCE TO
WHERE THEY CAN HERD AROUND ME

09:46.103 --> 09:48.724
AND I WILL ACTUALLY HAVE
PROTECTION NEXT WEEK.

09:48.758 --> 09:56.206
EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM RIGHT
NOW IS GOING TO THE END OF THIS.

09:56.241 --> 10:02.896
LET'S GO.

10:02.931 --> 10:06.655
WE NEED TO BRING EVERYBODY IN
THE ROOM AND OFFICIALLY FORM THE

10:06.689 --> 10:07.931
SLAUGHTERHOUSE.

10:07.965 --> 10:09.448
I WANT TO GET US ALL IN HERE,
AND BE LIKE ALL RIGHT, WE NEED

10:09.482 --> 10:12.448
TO MAKE THIS LIKE OFFICIAL,
OFFICIAL.

10:12.482 --> 10:13.172
GET IN, GET OUT.

10:13.206 --> 10:14.172
I RESPECT THAT.

10:14.206 --> 10:15.206
I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

10:15.241 --> 10:18.448
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS I
NEED THE NUMBERS.

10:18.482 --> 10:21.620
EVERYBODY IN HERE HAS NO IDEA
THAT THEY WERE HAND SELECTED FOR

10:21.655 --> 10:23.931
A SINGLE PURPOSE, KEEPING ME
SAFE.

10:23.965 --> 10:31.413
WHAT AT THE DON'T REALIZE IS
THAT IS HAPPENING AND I NEED TO

10:31.448 --> 10:36.103
KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THESE PEOPLE
I TELL YOU WHAT, I'M SOMETHING

10:36.137 --> 10:37.310
ELSE.

10:37.344 --> 10:43.206
POINT BLANK, EVERYBODY IS
100%-- I BRING IN ALYSSA, SHE

10:43.241 --> 10:48.137
REMINDED ME OF MY LITTLE SISTER,
YEAH, I KNOW I NOMINATED HER.

10:48.172 --> 10:50.241
THERE IS NO STOPPING HER.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.517
NONE.

10:51.551 --> 10:57.517
HAVE I DEREK, X AND FRANK, I
HAVE FINAL TWO, I WANT THEM IN

10:57.551 --> 10:58.206
THIS GROUP.

10:58.241 --> 11:01.862
THE ONLY WAY THIS BLOWS UP.

11:01.896 --> 11:04.482
THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE IS A LOT
OF PEOPLE, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS

11:04.517 --> 11:06.103
IS DPING TO, WITHOUT.

11:06.137 --> 11:09.655
I'M TBING TO PLAY ALONG WITH THE
SLAUGHTERHOUSE RIGHT NOW BUT IF

11:09.689 --> 11:13.034
THIS PLANE GETS SHOT DOWN I HAVE
MY PARENTS SHOOT AND I'M THE

11:13.068 --> 11:14.241
FIRST ONE OFF OF IT.

11:14.275 --> 11:17.344
I LIKE THE LAWYERHOUSE AS A
CONCEPT BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE

11:17.379 --> 11:23.172
WITHIN THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE WHO
DEFINITELY HAVE HAD TENSION SO

11:23.206 --> 11:24.827
WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES.

11:24.862 --> 11:27.241
BEING A MEMBER IN THE
SLAUGHTERHOUSE ALLIANCE COULD

11:27.275 --> 11:29.965
NOT HAVE COME AT A BETTER TIME.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.862
IT STILL WORRIES ME I AM STILL
ON THE BLOCK BUT AS LONG AS THE

11:32.896 --> 11:35.448
ALLIANCE STICKS WITH ME I THINK
CAN I GET THE VOTES.

11:35.482 --> 11:39.758
SO WE'RE GOOD.

11:49.275 --> 11:58.103
NOW HAVE I TO SET MYSELF UP.

11:58.137 --> 12:00.413
THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE IS GREAT
BUT IF I CAN GET THE OTHER SIDE

12:00.448 --> 12:04.758
-OF THE HOUSE TOO,
-ING OLD
-FRENCHIE:
-DO SOME DAMAGE AND BE

12:04.793 --> 12:09.482
COVERED ALL THE WAY AROUND.

12:09.517 --> 12:13.862
I CAME INTO THE HOUSE AND I
WAS LIKE I WANT AN ALLIANCE WITH

12:13.896 --> 12:15.034
ALL GIRLS.

12:15.068 --> 12:21.586
AN ALL GIRL A
LINES-- ALLIANCE PLUS FRENCHIE.

12:21.620 --> 12:23.344
LOOK AT YOU.

12:23.379 --> 12:31.310
AN ALL GIRLS ALLIANCE LEAD BY
FRENCHIE, WHO ISN'T A GIRL.

12:31.344 --> 12:33.758
CUZ THAT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE.

12:33.793 --> 12:37.827
HE WANTS TO KEEP US CLOSE SO
HE CAN CONTROL US, MAN

12:37.862 --> 12:40.517
-EU7
-ITY-- MANIPULATE US AN GAIN
INFORMATION FROM US, SO NO, NO

12:40.551 --> 12:41.448
THANKS.

12:41.482 --> 12:43.034
THE FRENCH ANGEL.

12:43.068 --> 12:44.448
THE FRENCH KISSES WITHIN THE
FRENCH KISSES.

12:44.482 --> 12:45.620
THAT IS SO CUTE.

12:45.655 --> 12:49.034
I LIKE THAT.

12:49.068 --> 12:54.896
AND WE COULD FRENCH KISS.

12:54.931 --> 12:59.758
FROM WHAT I RECALL, USUALLY
GIRLS START DPIRL'S ALLIANCES.

12:59.793 --> 13:03.862
I DON'T THINK I NEED TO BE IN A
GIRL'S ALLIANCE THAT WAS STARTED

13:03.896 --> 13:06.862
BY A GUY.

13:06.896 --> 13:12.586
CAN WE-- FOR ME, CAN WE DO
THAT WITHIN STOP, STOP, STOP,

13:12.620 --> 13:14.482
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS.

13:14.517 --> 13:19.620
WE DON'T TRUST FRENCHIE.

13:19.655 --> 13:24.206
I AM GOING ALONG WITH
FRENCHIE'S FRENCH KISS ALLIANCE

13:24.241 --> 13:27.034
BECAUSE HOW DO YOU REALLY TELL
HIM NO.

13:27.068 --> 13:32.758
BUT FRENCHIE, YOU MAY BE THE ONE
GETTING KISSED GOOD-BYE BY ALL

13:32.793 --> 13:34.034
THE GIRLS.

13:34.068 --> 13:37.206
IF THEY TRY TO GET RID OF ME,
WE WOULD HAVE THE NUMBERS AND

13:37.241 --> 13:42.448
THEY COULDN'T DO IT.

13:42.482 --> 13:46.344
Julie: UP NEXT COULD
FRENCHIE'S MULTIALLIANCE POWER

13:46.379 --> 13:48.827
TRIP BE TRAVIS' SAVING GRACE?

13:48.862 --> 13:51.068
THEN WE CROWN A NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

13:51.103 --> 13:53.551
WHO WILL RISE TO POWER.

13:53.586 --> 13:58.000
AND IN THE PROCESS, KEEP THEIR
ENTIRE TEAM SAFE FOR THE WEEK.

13:58.034 --> 13:58.689
STAY WITH US.

14:13.551 --> 14:15.724
Julie: WELCOME
BACK TO "BIG BROTHER," FEELING

14:15.758 --> 14:20.620
THE HEAT TRAVIS EMPLOYS AN
UNUSUAL TACTIC TO STRIP THE

14:20.655 --> 14:25.517
TARGET OFF HIS BACK.

14:25.551 --> 14:30.068
WHO IS BAKING THE CAKE FOR
THE BIRTHDAY PARTY.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.655
KYLAND IS TURNING 30 AND WE
WANT TO DO SOMETHING BIG FOR

14:32.689 --> 14:33.310
HIM.

14:33.344 --> 14:34.896
I'M IFING TO CALL TRAVIS.

14:34.931 --> 14:41.000
HE'S A GREAT GUY AND WE'VE
GOT TO GO ALL OUT.

14:41.034 --> 14:45.896
ONE OF THE LUCKY LADIES IS
GOING TO BE GIVING KY A LAP

14:45.931 --> 14:46.482
DANCE TONIGHT.

14:46.517 --> 14:48.827
WE WANT YOU TO DO IT.

14:48.862 --> 14:52.034
OKAY I KNOW I'M ON THE BLOCK
THIS WEEK BUT ULTIMATELY I'M

14:52.068 --> 14:54.655

14:58.551 --> 15:03.827
FACE OF ADVERSITY.

15:05.827 --> 15:09.310
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.

15:09.344 --> 15:18.551

15:18.586 --> 15:19.172
WOW.

15:19.206 --> 15:19.965
HEY.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.482
THIS IS THE GIFT.

15:24.517 --> 15:25.655
OH MY GOD.

15:25.689 --> 15:28.206
TAKE IT OFF.

15:28.241 --> 15:33.517
DAMN, I WISH IT WERE MY
BIRTHDAY SO I COULD GET A STRIP

15:33.551 --> 15:38.551
TEASE FROM TRAVISA.

15:38.586 --> 15:40.137
OH.

15:40.172 --> 15:40.448
HEY.

15:40.482 --> 15:41.344

15:46.172 --> 15:47.724
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

15:47.758 --> 15:50.517
HIS MUSCLES HAVE MUSCLES THAT
HAVE MUSCLES.

15:50.551 --> 15:52.103
LIKE YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.

15:52.137 --> 15:56.586
OH MAN, OH MAN.

15:56.620 --> 16:00.655
I MEAN AFTER THAT DANCY DANCE
I KNOW HAVE I GOTTEN KIELAND'S

16:00.689 --> 16:01.896
VOTES.

16:01.931 --> 16:03.517
I REALLY JUST NEED SIX MORE
BIRTHDAYS BEFORE EVICTION NIGHT

16:03.551 --> 16:05.137
AND I SHOULD BE GOOD.

16:05.172 --> 16:10.172
OH MAN, OH MY GOODNESS.

16:10.206 --> 16:16.172
THANK YOU.

16:16.206 --> 16:20.482
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

16:20.517 --> 16:26.551
I'M PRETTY CONCERNED ABOUT
LIKE HAVING ONE LESS TEAM MEMBER

16:26.586 --> 16:27.896
FOR H.O.H.

16:27.931 --> 16:31.034
THAT COULD CREATE A WHOLE LOT
OF CHAOS.

16:31.068 --> 16:33.482
TRAVIS IS SITTING ON THE
BLOCK AND FRENCHIE HAS ALREADY

16:33.517 --> 16:37.379
SAID HE IS COMING FOR A BIG
TARGET THIS WEEK, A BIG OLD-- IT

16:37.413 --> 16:41.689
SIM PER TIFF THAT ALL THE
MEMBERS STAY IN THE HOUSE THIS

16:41.724 --> 16:45.034
WEEK AND ALYSSA GOES HOME,
BECAUSE IF ONE OF OUR TEAM

16:45.068 --> 16:47.551
MEMBERS WINS H.O.H., WE WIN
SAFETY FOR THE WEEK.

16:47.586 --> 16:52.965
AND I WANT TO HAVE ALL OF THE
SAFETY I CAN GET.

16:53.000 --> 17:00.586
IF I'M HERE NECK WEEK, I'M
THE TARGET F SHE IS, SHE IS NOT.

17:00.620 --> 17:04.172
IF EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE IS
ALREADY WILLING TO VOTE YOU OUT

17:04.206 --> 17:07.000
THIS WEEK, IF ARE YOU IN THE
HOUSE NEXT WEEK, IT WOULD BE

17:07.034 --> 17:11.034
EASY TO PUT YOU BACK ON THE
BLOCK, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GET OFF

17:11.068 --> 17:16.172
RIGHT NOW, I CAN OFFER YOU A
SHIELD BECAUSE YOU ARE POSSIBLY

17:16.206 --> 17:18.413
A TARGET FOR NEXT WEEK,
FRENCHIE.

17:18.448 --> 17:21.586
I CAN OFFER YOU A SHIELD.

17:21.620 --> 17:34.137
WHAT CAN SHE OFFER YOU WHICH
TAKES THE TARGET OFF OF HIM.

17:42.586 --> 17:49.206
ALL RIGHT, SO THE POINT I
HAVE THAT I THINK WILL BENEFIT

17:49.241 --> 17:52.137
BOTH OF YOUR GAMES, MR. FRENCH
HAS A LOT OF PLAY IN THIS HOUSE

17:52.172 --> 17:55.896
MEANING YOUR BOY HAS TO DO SOME
PLAYING OF MR. FRENCH, HOPEFULLY

17:55.931 --> 17:58.172
I CAN TAKE THAT TARGET OFF MY
BACK.

17:58.206 --> 18:00.310
I DO HAVE A VISION BUT IT'S TIME
TO GET SELLING.

18:00.344 --> 18:03.103
THE FIRST ONE BEING MY LOYALTY.

18:03.137 --> 18:07.931
HAVE I NOT TOLD, YOU, I SAID
THE ONE THING, TRAVIS IS

18:07.965 --> 18:08.344
EXTREMELY LOYAL.

18:08.379 --> 18:08.793
ABSOLUTELY.

18:08.827 --> 18:09.862
I KNOW THIS.

18:09.896 --> 18:11.137
OKAY, OKAY.

18:11.172 --> 18:13.896
POINT TWO, YOU HAVE EXPRESSED IT
A LOT, YOU THINK IT WOULD BE A

18:13.931 --> 18:17.172
PRETTY BIG TARGET ON YOUR BACK
NEXT WEEK IF I STAYED.

18:17.206 --> 18:20.482
I WOULD EASILY BE THE BIGGEST
TARGET NEXT WEEK TO GO HOME.

18:20.517 --> 18:24.034
THAT PUTS A SHIELD OVER YOU.

18:24.068 --> 18:26.827
THE LAST QUESTION I WILL LEAVE
YOU WITH IS AT THE END OF THE

18:26.862 --> 18:30.172
DAY, WHAT CAN ALYSSA ACTUALLY
PROVIDE YOU.

18:30.206 --> 18:35.310
SO THAT'S IT.

18:35.344 --> 18:35.965
YEAH.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.310
EITHER WAY, I LOVE YOU GUYS.

18:39.344 --> 18:42.034
ABSOLUTELY.

18:42.068 --> 18:44.793
I CAN DEFINITELY PULL THE
NUMBERS TO KEEP TRAVIS HERE IF I

18:44.827 --> 18:46.000
WANTED TO.

18:46.034 --> 18:49.758
AND IF ALYSSA LEFT OVER TRAVIS I
COULD PULL TRAVIS INTO THE

18:49.793 --> 18:53.724
SLAUGHTERHOUSE, THAT COULD GIVE
SLAUGHTERHOUSE A REAL, REAL

18:53.758 --> 18:55.137
LOYALTY BOOST.

18:55.172 --> 18:56.758
LOOK AT ALL OF YOU.

18:56.793 --> 19:02.827
HE HAS A SOLID POINT ON EVERY
ONE HE SAID.

19:02.862 --> 19:03.896
YEAH.

19:03.931 --> 19:05.862
