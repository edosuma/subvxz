OPUS PICTURES presents

00:33.167 --> 00:36.125
an IDIO PLAN production

00:45.000 --> 00:49.667
<i>This film is based on actual event,
but the names have been altered</i>

00:52.459 --> 01:01.667
<i>Yakchon Jct, Aug. 2000</i>

01:08.375 --> 01:08.959
What?

01:08.960 --> 01:11.500
<i>Where are you? Look at the time!</i>

01:11.501 --> 01:14.583
<i>- I'm on my way.
- Get home now!</i>

01:14.584 --> 01:17.125
<i>- Go to bed!
- Are you on a bike again?!</i>

01:40.375 --> 01:41.792
Hey!

01:59.083 --> 02:01.708
I'm sensing a major headache.

02:01.709 --> 02:02.709
What is?

02:03.125 --> 02:06.083
The massive joint crackdown

02:06.292 --> 02:09.250
prior to the World Cup
and the election here.

02:09.334 --> 02:13.000
Yeah? It's a good chance.

02:13.375 --> 02:15.166
What exactly is?

02:15.167 --> 02:18.125
The 2nd Declaration of War against crime.

02:18.542 --> 02:21.791
Boss, you aiming to become the chief?

02:21.792 --> 02:22.875
Say what?

02:22.876 --> 02:25.458
- Do I look the part?
- Of course, boss.

02:25.459 --> 02:27.999
- Congrats, chief.
- Shut your hole.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.209
- Let's go eat.
- Yes, boss.

02:36.209 --> 02:37.584
Hold on.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.584
Boys.

02:40.334 --> 02:42.709
Isn't he from the bar?

02:43.584 --> 02:47.542
- Yeah, the hooligan.
- What's he doing here?

02:47.792 --> 02:50.167
He came out of nowhere...

03:02.709 --> 03:04.876
What are you doing?

03:18.709 --> 03:20.209
What's this?

03:32.279 --> 03:34.112
Prosecution, sentence demand?

03:37.042 --> 03:40.959
As a preventative measure
against rise in violent crimes,

03:41.876 --> 03:44.209
we demand maximum allowed sentence.

03:46.876 --> 03:48.501
The sentencing is as follows.

03:49.834 --> 03:52.792
Defendant Cho Hyun-woo is

03:53.000 --> 03:54.918
sentenced to 15 years in prison.

03:55.292 --> 03:57.500
- That can't be!
- Mom...

03:57.501 --> 03:59.708
- That's not right!
- I didn't do this, mom!

03:59.709 --> 04:01.833
- Let him go!
- I'm innocent!

04:01.834 --> 04:04.041
- My baby...
- Please help!

04:04.042 --> 04:06.249
Mom, help me!

04:06.250 --> 04:08.833
Mom! Mom!

04:08.834 --> 04:09.626
You sons of bitches!

04:09.627 --> 04:12.375
Mom! I didn't kill anyone!

04:17.250 --> 04:26.958
<i>The court grants a party's motion on the grounds
of a legal defect in the original trial</i>

04:26.959 --> 04:33.959
<i>NEW TRIAL</i>

04:37.605 --> 04:39.271
Hey!

04:40.411 --> 04:43.662
Why aren't you coming home? Are you nuts?

04:44.259 --> 04:46.800
Do you ever feel responsible?

04:46.801 --> 04:49.841
It wasn't for a selfish reason.

04:49.842 --> 04:53.383
You really are nuts, then what?

04:54.009 --> 04:56.735
I didn't want you two
to feel inferior somehow.

04:56.760 --> 05:00.176
No, I never wanted
anything like that.

05:00.592 --> 05:04.591
We can talk about it at home,
why are we doing this here?

05:04.592 --> 05:07.884
I didn't want to see
seizure stickers at home.

05:08.176 --> 05:09.966
Are you two fighting again?

05:09.967 --> 05:10.967
Yes.

05:11.550 --> 05:13.591
No, baby, mom and dad
aren't fighting.

05:13.592 --> 05:15.424
No, we are.

05:15.425 --> 05:18.716
We're not fighting,
we're having a chat.

05:18.717 --> 05:20.508
I'm used to it.

05:20.509 --> 05:23.467
It's embarrassing, so be quiet.

05:23.634 --> 05:25.633
Okay, daddy's sorry.

05:25.634 --> 05:28.550
- What's with her language?
- She took after you.

05:30.450 --> 05:32.909
I'm involved in this trial.

05:33.011 --> 05:37.886
I got suckered by you
to pool my parents' money

05:37.926 --> 05:40.050
and bought an apartment
in the new city, no?

05:40.051 --> 05:41.634
Right, sorry.

05:43.300 --> 05:44.967
The court is now in session.

05:45.550 --> 05:48.549
Please leave, I'm really tired.

05:48.550 --> 05:50.092
Just go.

05:50.259 --> 05:52.009
End this right.

05:55.425 --> 05:58.383
Is the defendant present?

05:59.467 --> 06:01.009
Yes, Your Honor.

06:02.092 --> 06:03.550
And the plaintiff?

06:05.904 --> 06:09.237
Yes, we're here,
and in the hallways.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.051
Many of us are here.

06:11.342 --> 06:13.133
There are over 10,000 plaintiffs.

06:13.134 --> 06:15.259
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes, Your Honor.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.176
I do not take kindly

06:17.509 --> 06:21.592
to lawyers using trials
for wealth or promotion,

06:21.967 --> 06:23.509
I absolutely hate that.

06:23.634 --> 06:24.717
Neither do I.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.966
To protect my clients' assets,
I've put in my own funds...

06:27.967 --> 06:30.009
You are shameless!

06:31.051 --> 06:32.466
Sit down.

06:32.467 --> 06:34.176
Yes, Your Honor.

06:40.959 --> 06:42.626
Here is the verdict.

06:45.782 --> 06:47.198
How can you just leave!

06:48.176 --> 06:50.891
You must take responsibility!
I lost $500,000!

06:53.759 --> 06:55.176
You're a con man!

06:57.801 --> 06:59.383
A con man?!

07:02.926 --> 07:06.967
I paid for this trial
out of my own pocket!

07:07.618 --> 07:11.550
I'm in massive debt because of this!

07:11.967 --> 07:15.342
I gave everything, how am I a con man?!

07:16.550 --> 07:19.509
You should've settled, it's all over now!

07:19.842 --> 07:25.967
The court unfairly sided with
a large corporation.

07:26.218 --> 07:28.342
We must appeal, this is tyranny!

07:35.967 --> 07:39.259
I got a call, wait! Give me a second!

07:39.759 --> 07:41.176
Yes, sir!

07:41.801 --> 07:43.467
Yes, the trial is over.

07:43.967 --> 07:46.134
The Justice Department is a joke.

07:46.176 --> 07:49.509
The judiciary has to be reformed.

07:50.300 --> 07:53.259
Hello? Sir?

07:54.051 --> 07:56.467
I can't hear you, one moment please!

07:56.813 --> 08:00.354
Hello? I can't hear you.

08:01.467 --> 08:02.717
Hello?

08:10.623 --> 08:13.040
How am I supposed to live?

08:13.625 --> 08:17.042
Send this off and that's it then?

08:17.500 --> 08:22.792
Sending boys off to 2-year
military service is bad enough,

08:23.667 --> 08:27.792
but mine spent 10 years, in prison no less!

08:28.042 --> 08:30.375
I know you're in a bad spot.

08:30.376 --> 08:32.083
Look here, ma'am.

08:32.875 --> 08:34.041
What?

08:34.042 --> 08:35.875
I'm looking, so what?

08:36.418 --> 08:40.167
He paid for his crime, why should we pay?

08:40.376 --> 08:43.875
Your boy killed a man, a family man!

08:45.167 --> 08:48.666
His family received
$40,000 from our insurance.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.582
That's what we're asking you to pay.

08:50.583 --> 08:53.334
It's far more than $40,000!

08:53.459 --> 08:55.125
Money doesn't just sit around.

08:55.126 --> 08:58.083
Imagine 10 years of interest!

08:58.084 --> 09:01.458
There's no point in making a scene here.

09:01.459 --> 09:02.874
Let go, let go!

09:02.875 --> 09:06.376
- Please go home.
- Kill me instead!

09:07.875 --> 09:09.499
Hey, Yoo-min.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.917
<i>What's up?</i>

09:11.251 --> 09:15.749
That thing I asked last week,

09:15.750 --> 09:17.417
how did that pan out?

09:17.418 --> 09:19.959
<i>Sorry buddy, it's a tough time for us.</i>

09:20.376 --> 09:23.875
So, there's not a single opening?

09:24.167 --> 09:25.834
<i>I got a meeting.</i>

09:26.001 --> 09:28.500
<i>Let's get together for a beer, okay?</i>

09:32.834 --> 09:35.792
Must be nice to be busy.

09:43.709 --> 09:44.917
Hey girls!

09:45.126 --> 09:48.376
Come here, come here for a sec.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.001
Let's see.

09:53.750 --> 09:58.500
You got any teachers
you want to sue?

09:59.167 --> 10:03.667
Or seniors who hit you?

10:03.959 --> 10:05.625
- What the heck?
- Whatever.

10:05.709 --> 10:07.084
Let's go.

10:07.959 --> 10:09.500
- Is he crazy?
- Fine, go.

10:09.834 --> 10:11.292
Mid-life crisis?

10:13.251 --> 10:16.166
What the hell...

10:16.167 --> 10:18.417
<i>Mo Chang-hwan</i>

10:18.418 --> 10:20.126
Cheers!

10:24.126 --> 10:26.042
That's good!

10:26.500 --> 10:29.375
My boy's all grown up.

10:29.376 --> 10:32.541
You were a snot-nosed kid
when we first met.

10:32.542 --> 10:36.709
We met in a dorm, we were adults, asshole.

10:37.209 --> 10:40.792
That looks good, it's new?

10:41.126 --> 10:43.916
Fancy new watch.

10:43.917 --> 10:46.042
Stop, give it.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.917
Speaking of which,
return the watch I lent you.

10:54.042 --> 10:57.001
That's long gone.

10:57.042 --> 10:58.376
But it's a Rol...

10:59.179 --> 11:00.708
If you lost a Rolex...

11:00.709 --> 11:04.542
Wife took it to put food on the table.

11:06.562 --> 11:11.083
I heard about you on and off,
why did you do it?

11:11.084 --> 11:15.042
I wanted to go out with a bang.

11:17.875 --> 11:19.292
Mo Chang-hwan.

11:20.167 --> 11:22.792
Okay, let's work together.

11:23.126 --> 11:24.376
Say what?

11:24.959 --> 11:27.291
I'll let your firm
scout me, happy?

11:27.292 --> 11:30.833
Scouting's not up to you,
It's up to employer.

11:30.834 --> 11:34.875
There's no smarter and
cheaper lawyer than me.

11:35.084 --> 11:40.708
So the partners get 50:50?

11:40.709 --> 11:43.874
Joon-young, I'm happy that you're alive.

11:43.875 --> 11:46.541
Let's live long and prosperous.

11:46.542 --> 11:47.459
I'm off.

11:47.460 --> 11:49.542
Chang-hwan, sit. Sit back down.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.792
Come on.

11:54.292 --> 11:57.792
Bro, can't you let me work at your firm?

11:58.292 --> 12:01.166
I'll get whatever that will rake in money.

12:01.167 --> 12:05.126
It's not up to me, my boss is
still alive and kicking!

12:07.209 --> 12:11.709
It's my last favor as your friend.

12:13.334 --> 12:16.292
I'll do my absolute best.

12:17.209 --> 12:18.709
Sorry, sorry.

12:19.875 --> 12:21.084
Good morning.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.251
I'm late.

12:24.492 --> 12:26.558
Let's start the mentoring session.

12:26.583 --> 12:27.916
Okay.

12:27.917 --> 12:33.917
I went to Hermes party
with a doctor friend yesterday,

12:34.671 --> 12:37.539
and people were lining up
to get examined...

12:37.564 --> 12:38.689
Are you still drunk?

12:38.956 --> 12:40.081
I'm fine.

12:41.167 --> 12:44.126
He was asked about 3 glands.

12:44.552 --> 12:48.052
Prostate, thyroid and lymph.

12:49.092 --> 12:51.509
Since it was free, they went nuts.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.009
Koreans really love free things.

12:55.724 --> 12:59.308
The friend looked annoyed and whispered,

13:00.092 --> 13:02.509
"Mr. Gu, what'd you do in my place?"

13:03.842 --> 13:06.217
What do you think I said?

13:08.467 --> 13:11.676
"Bill everyone who requested diagnosis."

13:12.634 --> 13:15.259
So, here's today's question.

13:16.301 --> 13:21.883
What do you do first thing in the morning?

13:22.592 --> 13:24.050
As a lawyer.

13:28.676 --> 13:29.759
You?

13:32.009 --> 13:34.342
Looks like we're closing shop.

13:34.367 --> 13:39.409
You bill your doctor friend.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.049
Your name?

13:44.050 --> 13:47.551
Lee Joon-young,
we studied for the bar together.

13:51.175 --> 13:52.508
Are you drunk?

13:52.509 --> 13:55.467
No, I can't drink at all.

13:56.009 --> 13:57.551
Anyway, bingo.

13:58.050 --> 14:01.799
Do you know why people
go to trial nowadays?

14:01.800 --> 14:05.718
99.9% of the time it's about money.

14:06.551 --> 14:08.758
Ergo, I firmly believe that

14:08.759 --> 14:13.551
the client's asset protection
is a lawyer's ultimate goal.

14:15.509 --> 14:19.258
The type of client whose asset
needs protection is also crucial.

14:19.259 --> 14:22.216
He may've committed crimes
against our society or...

14:22.217 --> 14:25.175
A client with a massive wealth, of course.

14:25.217 --> 14:26.259
Pardon?

14:26.800 --> 14:32.216
A law firm is a corporation
that provides law service.

14:32.217 --> 14:35.676
As such, it must
generate profit.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.342
But still,

14:37.634 --> 14:40.925
shouldn't public service
be a lawyer's priority?

14:41.426 --> 14:42.718
Public service?

14:45.718 --> 14:50.634
Many people believe that
our society is rotting at its core.

14:51.217 --> 14:52.551
Why is that?

14:52.592 --> 14:54.633
Because they're all poor.

14:54.634 --> 14:57.967
From the rich's perspective,
it's an ideal society.

14:59.634 --> 15:05.134
At our level,
let's be frank, okay?

15:05.175 --> 15:10.301
We spent hundreds of
thousands to reach here.

15:10.551 --> 15:14.049
Because of money, right?

15:14.050 --> 15:17.009
At least that's what I want,
since a child.

15:23.175 --> 15:24.467
Interesting.

15:32.676 --> 15:35.009
Did I say something wrong?

15:38.301 --> 15:41.675
He was a great student,
made a mint for his firm too.

15:41.676 --> 15:43.634
So why is he here?

15:44.009 --> 15:46.216
He helmed new city class action lawsuit...

15:46.217 --> 15:47.759
That's par for the course.

15:48.134 --> 15:51.467
You go after one big score
and lose everything.

15:52.592 --> 15:53.592
School?

15:53.925 --> 15:56.092
He dropped out of no name college.

15:56.467 --> 15:57.592
Mr. Mo.

15:59.009 --> 16:00.050
Mr. Gu.

16:01.426 --> 16:03.551
You have an event today.

16:03.925 --> 16:06.050
I got another appointment...

16:06.551 --> 16:08.675
what to do...

16:08.676 --> 16:11.842
- Should I cancel?
- No, don't do that.

16:15.634 --> 16:17.134
Mr. Lee Joon-young?

16:17.925 --> 16:19.134
Yes, sir.

16:19.883 --> 16:23.467
There's a case I'd like to hire you for.

16:25.634 --> 16:28.592
Thank you, I'll do my best.

16:29.092 --> 16:30.217
Okay.

16:35.509 --> 16:36.634
Treat me to lunch, OK?

16:37.342 --> 16:40.175
Free Legal Consultation

16:45.426 --> 16:46.592
Over here.

16:54.467 --> 16:56.799
Could you smile a bit?

16:56.800 --> 16:59.174
This will go on our homepage.

16:59.175 --> 17:01.050
Can we go? Time's up.

17:01.426 --> 17:02.883
There's one more!

17:04.920 --> 17:07.002
She signed up a month ago.

17:09.156 --> 17:10.906
It was dull, wasn't it?

17:12.550 --> 17:14.467
I don't believe this...

17:15.967 --> 17:19.509
How are you so good
without working eyes?

17:21.460 --> 17:24.758
You don't own this sea.

17:24.759 --> 17:26.092
Bullshit.

17:26.425 --> 17:28.300
The sea is fair to all.

17:28.673 --> 17:31.423
How much could the blind take, you think?

17:33.501 --> 17:35.291
I got a clam!

17:35.292 --> 17:36.542
It's a rock.

17:38.375 --> 17:40.500
What's with her accent?

17:40.501 --> 17:43.417
She's a bride from Uzbeck or whatever.

17:48.751 --> 17:51.501
She's got it bad.

17:51.876 --> 17:54.459
We wanted to introduce her
to a real lawyer,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.459
but no one will take her case.

18:01.626 --> 18:03.876
Whoa! Whoa!

18:12.375 --> 18:13.751
It's a flat.

18:17.584 --> 18:18.792
What now?

18:19.209 --> 18:20.918
I think it's that house.

18:32.918 --> 18:34.334
Mr. Lee!

18:37.417 --> 18:39.375
Anyone home?

18:41.334 --> 18:42.834
Hello?

18:43.959 --> 18:45.626
We're from Themis.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.959
Anyone home?

18:48.125 --> 18:50.082
Here's somebody.

18:50.083 --> 18:52.459
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

18:52.626 --> 18:54.834
We're here about the indemnity case.

18:57.083 --> 18:58.083
Jesus!

19:01.667 --> 19:03.250
What's with him?

19:04.626 --> 19:06.417
Goddammit!

19:07.542 --> 19:10.501
I don't believe this.

19:11.542 --> 19:12.625
What's going on here?

19:12.626 --> 19:14.750
I ain't got no money, leave us alone.

19:14.751 --> 19:16.125
What?

19:17.242 --> 19:19.347
I think there's a misunderstanding.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.199
Get the hell out!

19:21.200 --> 19:23.450
We got guests?

19:23.826 --> 19:25.784
Afternoon, ma'am!

19:26.242 --> 19:27.491
Mr. Lee!

19:27.492 --> 19:30.324
I'm here with a lawyer,
this is Lee Joon-young.

19:30.325 --> 19:31.491
Good afternoon.

19:31.492 --> 19:34.449
Didn't you request a legal consultation?

19:34.450 --> 19:35.701
Yes, yes.

19:36.450 --> 19:39.033
This is all useless shit!

19:39.034 --> 19:41.616
You're the useless piece of shit!

19:41.617 --> 19:43.324
We gotta do something!

19:43.325 --> 19:46.158
We got conned enough times already!

19:46.159 --> 19:49.951
So we should drink booze
and sleep all day?

19:51.034 --> 19:57.033
I'm begging you, let me be!

19:57.034 --> 19:58.991
Listen to that bastard.

19:58.992 --> 20:01.325
Wait here for a bit, Mr. Lawyer.

20:01.409 --> 20:06.158
I gotta go to the market
and make some money.

20:06.159 --> 20:09.118
Certainly, ma'am, take your time.

20:13.784 --> 20:15.408
- Mr. Lee.
- Get in.

20:15.409 --> 20:16.492
Mr. Lee!

20:16.992 --> 20:19.242
Get in, I'll drive.

20:19.534 --> 20:21.866
It'll be a while
before the tow truck arrives.

20:21.867 --> 20:23.616
Jesus H. Christ!

20:23.617 --> 20:26.575
Why don't we listen to her story?

20:26.867 --> 20:30.742
Didn't you see? He's a major asshole.

20:33.296 --> 20:34.825
Fine, don't do it then.

20:34.826 --> 20:36.325
Of course I won't.

20:42.367 --> 20:45.701
The boss cares deeply
about the firm's image.

20:46.701 --> 20:49.076
How do I report this to him tomorrow?

20:55.826 --> 20:57.742
Goddamn!

20:59.826 --> 21:05.450
Holy shit! Mother Christ!

21:08.200 --> 21:10.450
Right to indemnity is,

21:12.200 --> 21:15.449
when a third party pays out
on your behalf,

21:15.450 --> 21:16.991
they have the right to claim it.

21:16.992 --> 21:20.367
I don't know what the shit you're saying.

21:24.909 --> 21:27.574
The Welfare Service
compensated the victim,

21:27.575 --> 21:32.534
the family whom you killed 14 years ago.

21:32.784 --> 21:34.741
$40,000 or whatever.

21:34.742 --> 21:38.034
Since they paid that out,
they want you to pay them back.

21:38.234 --> 21:41.484
You understand? The consultation is over.

21:41.951 --> 21:43.450
I didn't kill him.

21:44.159 --> 21:45.242
Pardon?

21:45.951 --> 21:47.867
I didn't kill anyone.

21:48.992 --> 21:51.283
Sure, I feel terrible.

21:51.308 --> 21:55.308
I know shit about indemshit,
so tell them to fuck off.

21:55.951 --> 21:57.659
I'll tell them to fuck off.

22:00.659 --> 22:02.534
What exactly is law?

22:05.784 --> 22:08.367
You keep going on about law.

22:09.909 --> 22:13.325
Is it really there
to protect people?

22:19.242 --> 22:20.659
Listen.

22:20.951 --> 22:22.951
What do you want to say?

22:33.148 --> 22:36.409
- Where you going?
- Come with me!

22:36.450 --> 22:38.534
- Let go! Let go!
- Holy cow!

22:38.909 --> 22:41.242
I'm a busy man, what do you want?

22:42.118 --> 22:44.575
Follow me, now!

22:46.034 --> 22:49.616
School is pointless, I learn shit there.

22:49.617 --> 22:52.449
School isn't for learning.

22:52.450 --> 22:56.200
It's for easing other
people's minds, like me.

22:56.325 --> 22:57.701
Shit.

22:58.909 --> 23:01.033
You gotta fold it,
and show it off a little.

23:01.034 --> 23:04.409
You look like a movie star.

23:04.701 --> 23:06.742
A movie star?

23:07.159 --> 23:08.325
I know.

23:10.951 --> 23:12.867
No way, fold it down!

23:12.909 --> 23:14.741
- Collar down!
- Let go!

23:14.742 --> 23:16.199
You bastard! Keep it down!

23:16.200 --> 23:17.679
This is style!

23:30.450 --> 23:31.825
Welcome.

23:31.826 --> 23:33.450
No customer again?

23:33.951 --> 23:37.575
Drinkers in Yakchon
must all be dead, dang it.

23:37.701 --> 23:39.826
Come in, it's cool here.

23:44.046 --> 23:45.926
Doesn't that bastard go to school?

23:45.951 --> 23:47.324
Why's he here at this hour?

23:47.325 --> 23:51.450
His pops died at sea,
and he lives with his mom.

23:51.784 --> 23:56.076
This town is full of hooligans like him.

23:56.409 --> 24:00.742
I'm the only saint here who hires them.

24:02.409 --> 24:06.118
Want some drink? We got a new chick.

24:07.159 --> 24:08.784
She's no chick.

24:09.325 --> 24:11.159
More like an egg.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.909
Nice and soft, eh?

24:17.951 --> 24:20.199
- What's up?
- Nothing, sir.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.408
Boss,

24:21.409 --> 24:23.574
she looks underage though.

24:23.575 --> 24:27.200
Dickwad, did you see a cop
getting arrested for anything?

24:27.492 --> 24:30.826
We are sly as fuck, arrest me if you want.

24:32.025 --> 24:33.399
What's your name?

24:34.076 --> 24:35.658
- Su-jung.
- Su-jung?

24:35.659 --> 24:38.492
She sounds fertile!

24:51.624 --> 24:52.832
Shit!

25:02.018 --> 25:03.268
Hey!

25:07.459 --> 25:08.709
What the hell?!

25:09.084 --> 25:10.834
You got shit for eyes?!

25:14.292 --> 25:16.459
Hey! Get over here!

25:16.709 --> 25:18.709
Come here!

25:19.667 --> 25:22.376
You're so fucking dead...

25:34.459 --> 25:37.084
He came out of nowhere...

25:58.042 --> 25:59.624
What's this?

25:59.625 --> 26:02.583
You said you met the suspect.

26:02.667 --> 26:04.125
Is that all?

26:04.126 --> 26:06.251
No, well...

26:07.042 --> 26:09.334
Everything happened so fast...

26:09.542 --> 26:13.167
Are you lying to me?

26:17.167 --> 26:18.251
So.

26:19.209 --> 26:20.792
How's your memory now?

26:21.625 --> 26:24.125
I, I...

26:24.126 --> 26:26.418
I didn't kill him...

26:30.078 --> 26:31.583
Look at this.

26:32.459 --> 26:35.792
Killers always brand themselves.

26:36.126 --> 26:37.167
What?

26:38.209 --> 26:39.667
Son of a bitch.

26:40.292 --> 26:41.542
Raise your head.

26:42.583 --> 26:44.334
Raise it.

26:47.209 --> 26:49.541
Ask the bar owner.

26:49.542 --> 26:53.291
I met him after midnight, he called me.

26:53.292 --> 26:55.667
He said he never saw you.

26:58.750 --> 26:59.874
What?

26:59.875 --> 27:01.041
Sit up straight.

27:01.042 --> 27:03.542
Is this an act, asshole?

27:05.500 --> 27:06.667
Strip.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.833
Strip to your undies.

27:08.834 --> 27:10.291
I said strip!

27:10.292 --> 27:14.542
Okay, okay, I'll do.

27:16.001 --> 27:17.292
Write this down.

27:22.750 --> 27:24.251
Son of a bitch.

27:24.542 --> 27:26.209
- Strip faster.
- Okay, okay.

27:26.542 --> 27:29.500
Useless piece of shit.

27:31.376 --> 27:34.334
This asshole and the cabby
got into an argument.

27:34.792 --> 27:37.541
They were cutting
each other off on the road,

27:37.542 --> 27:39.375
and swearing and shit.

27:39.376 --> 27:43.083
He blocked the cab with his scooter,

27:43.084 --> 27:45.750
and took out his knife.

27:47.376 --> 27:48.500
What?

27:49.934 --> 27:52.642
What's going on?

27:52.667 --> 27:54.874
You should know better than I.

27:54.875 --> 27:58.291
Then he jumped into the back of the cab,

27:58.292 --> 27:59.624
and with this,

27:59.625 --> 28:04.208
he stabbed the driver's
back, waist and neck.

28:04.209 --> 28:06.458
Back, waist and neck...

28:06.459 --> 28:07.834
What a bastard.

28:08.750 --> 28:12.750
Wait, wait, detective.

28:13.001 --> 28:16.874
How can I kill a man with this?

28:16.875 --> 28:18.375
You goddamn shit!

28:18.376 --> 28:20.458
He's not with the program.

28:20.459 --> 28:24.001
Boss, I've been thinking,

28:24.334 --> 28:26.393
the victim's wounds are quite large,

28:26.418 --> 28:29.167
and this knife's bit too small.

28:29.418 --> 28:31.749
What? Yeah?

28:31.750 --> 28:33.583
- A little...
- Boss!

28:35.042 --> 28:36.583
I found it!

28:36.875 --> 28:38.916
This was in the bar kitchen.

28:38.917 --> 28:41.583
It matches the victim's wounds.

28:42.710 --> 28:43.709
See?

28:43.710 --> 28:45.792
This is the smoking gun.

28:51.245 --> 28:54.579
Goddammit! I didn't do it!

28:54.792 --> 28:56.125
"Goddammit"?

28:56.406 --> 28:58.780
He doesn't know me yet.

28:59.134 --> 29:00.509
I'm a...

29:00.759 --> 29:04.967
Yakchon Football Club striker!

29:05.551 --> 29:07.426
This bastard still doesn't get it.

29:10.467 --> 29:13.092
That's enough.

29:14.342 --> 29:17.009
Think of it as early military enlistment.

29:40.009 --> 29:42.384
How long was he out?

29:44.175 --> 29:46.175
Shouldn't we resuscitate him?

29:46.759 --> 29:48.466
Mr. Lee, are you dead?

29:48.467 --> 29:49.759
Get up.

29:50.426 --> 29:51.551
He's alive.

29:52.509 --> 29:54.133
Come on, wake up.

29:54.134 --> 29:57.426
You're here?

29:58.342 --> 29:59.841
What took you so long?

29:59.842 --> 30:01.799
I'm out of the divorce case
due to a clerical error.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.091
Huh? What happened?

30:04.092 --> 30:07.008
Paralegal forgot to send
a document to the court.

30:07.009 --> 30:09.383
But I apologized...

30:09.384 --> 30:10.967
You apologized?

30:12.050 --> 30:14.133
You're a bona fide idiot.

30:14.134 --> 30:15.300
I'm a what?

30:15.301 --> 30:17.967
Just look at the world.

30:18.175 --> 30:21.342
No one in power apologizes for anything.

30:21.592 --> 30:22.134
Right.

30:22.135 --> 30:24.466
Not that they can't, they won't.

30:24.467 --> 30:25.217
Why?

30:25.218 --> 30:27.300
Once he says it, it becomes his fault.

30:27.301 --> 30:30.758
Negotiations are futile after that.

30:30.759 --> 30:32.841
So a lawyer...

30:32.842 --> 30:34.133
Listen, you pricks!

30:34.134 --> 30:36.216
A lawyer mustn't!

30:36.217 --> 30:41.633
Listen, a lawyer must never
apologize, got it?

30:41.634 --> 30:43.179
Yes, sir.

30:43.240 --> 30:44.490
Yes, sir!

30:44.592 --> 30:46.174
Come with me, asswipe.

30:46.175 --> 30:48.925
- We're on the clock.
- Come on!

30:52.718 --> 30:56.759
Remember the homeless man case?

30:57.210 --> 31:01.425
The one where the prosecutor
created a suspect.

31:01.426 --> 31:04.133
Yeah, it was all over the news for a bit.

31:04.134 --> 31:05.175
What about it?

31:06.509 --> 31:08.924
Your boss likes the news.

31:08.925 --> 31:12.758
A lawyer rescues a
wrongfully convicted man.

31:12.759 --> 31:14.592
Rescue how?

31:14.842 --> 31:18.384
Right to indemnity isn't illegal,
and that trial was 10 years ago.

31:20.134 --> 31:21.342
It's too much, right?

31:21.441 --> 31:22.775
Right.

31:22.800 --> 31:26.341
If that was doable,
then you're a made man.

31:26.342 --> 31:28.758
A made man, I tell you.

31:28.759 --> 31:30.217
Are you drunk?

31:30.800 --> 31:34.342
I'm fucked, I can't unspill this.

31:35.592 --> 31:36.718
What?

31:37.551 --> 31:38.675
What what?

31:38.676 --> 31:40.301
What did you say?

31:40.467 --> 31:42.467
"I'm fucked, I can't unspill this."

31:47.842 --> 31:49.883
Why isn't it doable?

31:50.134 --> 31:51.717
Why not what?

31:51.718 --> 31:53.551
Unspilling it.

31:57.342 --> 32:00.591
Get the partners together.

32:00.592 --> 32:03.050
I gotta go, get the bill for me.

32:03.618 --> 32:04.618
Are you a moron?

32:04.975 --> 32:07.891
Cho Hyun-woo served 10 years for homicide,

32:08.009 --> 32:10.509
and was released in 2010.

32:10.676 --> 32:12.258
3 years later,

32:12.259 --> 32:16.591
the government demanded
indemnity paid to the bereaved family,

32:16.592 --> 32:18.508
which amounted to $40,000,

32:18.509 --> 32:20.633
but with snowballing interest

32:20.634 --> 32:23.676
it's up to $170,000 at current state.

32:24.175 --> 32:27.592
He spent his most
formative years in prison,

32:27.634 --> 32:30.509
now he's in a downward spiral
with this debt.

32:30.800 --> 32:33.509
What's more, if he doesn't pay,

32:33.800 --> 32:36.009
he may face additional prison time.

32:38.967 --> 32:41.759
Why should our firm handle this case?

32:42.009 --> 32:44.924
Don't mention justice
or righting the wrong.

32:44.925 --> 32:46.966
- Money, of course.
- How so?

32:46.967 --> 32:49.967
If Themis takes this case and wins it,

32:50.509 --> 32:52.883
it'll generate positive reputation.

32:53.718 --> 32:58.508
Why do big corporations pour
money into brand campaigns?

32:58.509 --> 33:02.050
Why do you do free legal consultations?

33:03.301 --> 33:07.341
A good public image is invaluable.

33:07.342 --> 33:08.718
According to my review,

33:09.050 --> 33:13.134
the Welfare Services has
the legal precedent.

33:13.342 --> 33:15.050
How will you crack this?

33:15.725 --> 33:18.523
We request a new trial of
his original homicide case.

33:23.050 --> 33:27.467
If we clear his name,
the indemnity is nullified.

33:28.050 --> 33:30.342
No, no, that's impossible.

33:30.676 --> 33:34.925
You can't reverse a 14-year old
Supreme Court judgment.

33:35.092 --> 33:37.133
It's possible in theory.

33:37.134 --> 33:39.092
Of course it is.

33:39.451 --> 33:42.201
I'm saying it's got 0% probability.

33:42.474 --> 33:47.308
Even if we get a retrial,
what if Cho is the real killer?

33:47.842 --> 33:49.384
What do we do?

33:52.216 --> 33:53.550
Pardon me.

33:54.404 --> 33:59.905
Sir, since when did you care
that a client is guilty or not?

34:05.384 --> 34:08.342
Themis will...

34:12.342 --> 34:15.009
Okay, let's do it.

34:16.889 --> 34:22.474
Pending the outcome,
we'll consider you for a partner.

34:23.155 --> 34:25.806
Good work, any objections?

34:26.551 --> 34:30.009
Give Mr. Lee a corporate car.

34:31.842 --> 34:34.551
Temp employees aren't allowed?

34:35.342 --> 34:36.842
Are you serious?

34:40.023 --> 34:44.301
No! That's my car!

<i>To leave a message, please press 1.</i>

34:51.516 --> 34:54.766
Hyo-jin, it's me.

34:55.391 --> 34:57.725
I'm going to quit drinking.

34:57.726 --> 34:59.976
I got a real shot at a job.

35:03.018 --> 35:06.559
I miss our daughter and you too.

35:08.517 --> 35:12.392
Give me one last chance, I'm begging you.

35:14.018 --> 35:15.892
I love you, always.

35:18.892 --> 35:21.392
Okay, that felt real.

35:24.142 --> 35:27.224
So you want to see
the Cho Hyun-woo case records?

35:27.225 --> 35:28.809
Yes, that's correct.

35:30.793 --> 35:32.960
Wasn't this a right to indemnity case?

35:32.985 --> 35:35.443
Yes, we're going to request a new trial.

35:35.642 --> 35:37.349
<i>Primary Detective: Baek Cheol-ki</i>

35:37.350 --> 35:39.225
Baek Cheol-ki?

35:39.559 --> 35:41.141
You know him?

35:41.142 --> 35:44.309
I always suspected
his investigative techniques.

35:44.517 --> 35:46.266
There were a few similarities...

35:46.267 --> 35:49.809
To the Cho Hyun-woo case?

35:50.726 --> 35:53.725
Not sure yet, it's all circumstantial.

35:53.726 --> 35:55.350
I see.

35:55.681 --> 35:58.514
I'll accept your request
to review the case.

35:59.851 --> 36:03.725
The trial will begin in 3 months
on October 13.

36:03.726 --> 36:05.642
It can't be delayed even a day.

36:05.829 --> 36:08.205
Yes, ma'am, thank you.

36:43.142 --> 36:45.099
I was checking out the call log,

36:45.100 --> 36:48.349
the case report said
the defendant got into a brawl

36:48.350 --> 36:51.433
with the driver and he pulled a knife.

36:51.434 --> 36:53.891
But a person can't kill
while on the phone,

36:53.892 --> 36:57.976
so the exact time of the murder
would be when the cab stopped.

36:59.637 --> 37:00.970

Someone meddled with it.

37:29.037 --> 37:29.601
What?

37:29.602 --> 37:31.808
The data's been erased.

37:31.809 --> 37:33.808
Who would do such a thing?

37:33.809 --> 37:35.684
I dunno.

37:36.205 --> 37:37.955
Can you recover it?

37:39.027 --> 37:41.152
You're so lucky.

37:41.642 --> 37:44.642
Only a handful in Korea can fix this.

37:48.976 --> 37:52.767

38:07.434 --> 38:08.892
Am I right?

38:16.224 --> 38:18.058
Good.

38:46.084 --> 38:47.084
What about him?

38:47.118 --> 38:51.409
His lawyer showed up,
they're recovering the meter.

38:51.434 --> 38:52.683
His lawyer?

38:52.684 --> 38:55.601
That case wrapped ages ago!

38:55.741 --> 38:57.866
He's getting a new trial or something.

38:58.420 --> 38:59.392
A new trial?

38:59.393 --> 39:00.933
What do we do now?

39:00.934 --> 39:04.309
Isn't it obvious?
Shut your hole and fuck off!

39:04.601 --> 39:06.684
Don't ever call me again.

39:07.899 --> 39:09.691
He's a sly bastard.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.701
What's Choi Young-je up to nowadays?

39:13.726 --> 39:14.684
Who's that?

39:14.685 --> 39:17.267
The prosecutor on Cho's case!

39:19.142 --> 39:22.100
How much did you drink?

39:23.677 --> 39:27.006
None other than the local gang boss.

39:29.658 --> 39:31.658
It's hard paying back the debt, no?

39:37.146 --> 39:40.075
$40,000 became $170,000.

39:40.100 --> 39:42.809
What? There's someone worse than us?

39:43.097 --> 39:46.097
Who are they?
I need to learn a trick or two.

39:51.592 --> 39:53.726
Why did you look for me?

40:03.191 --> 40:07.942
There's a business that
I'm risking my life for,

40:08.834 --> 40:12.834
a highway is being built
by Yakchon's new town.

40:14.433 --> 40:16.433
Fucking highway.

40:17.667 --> 40:21.834
Anyway, there's a bastard
who got a whiff of this,

40:22.034 --> 40:23.934
but he's got more clout than me.

40:25.034 --> 40:29.034
There isn't much I can do,
I'm losing sleeping over it.

40:30.101 --> 40:31.934
Then I thought about you.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.533

40:36.767 --> 40:41.467

40:44.667 --> 40:46.467
Back the fuck off!

40:49.767 --> 40:52.767
I heard you're working with a lawyer.

40:53.467 --> 40:55.500
Don't be a sucker, asshole.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.734

the pigs' money.

41:00.467 --> 41:02.100
The pigs who put you in prison.

41:02.101 --> 41:05.734
Weren't they carrying out the law?

41:11.734 --> 41:14.834

41:28.101 --> 41:31.600
I didn't find any discrepancies
from the case report.

41:33.867 --> 41:37.799
The suspect supposedly
stabbed the driver inside the car,

41:37.800 --> 41:40.566
and it had to be done between
18 seconds and 2 minutes,

41:40.567 --> 41:42.433
is that possible?

41:44.967 --> 41:47.766
The original's gone, and
the copy's damaged.

41:47.767 --> 41:51.933
I need to uncover how they
tampered the incident report.

41:51.934 --> 41:54.934
This is your call log from that day.

41:56.034 --> 41:59.666
I went above and beyond
to retrieve the cab meter.

41:59.667 --> 42:02.100
The police obtained the meter log,

42:02.101 --> 42:04.599
but they never used it
during investigation.

42:04.600 --> 42:06.799
Is new trial or shit,

42:06.800 --> 42:08.533
will it work?

but we have to win.

42:13.767 --> 42:14.799
By the way,

42:14.800 --> 42:18.567
you know I can't pay you,
so why do you help?

42:19.500 --> 42:21.067
You know,

42:22.067 --> 42:23.799
promoting public interest.

42:23.800 --> 42:26.633
You know, why do you laugh?

42:26.634 --> 42:30.667
It's called 'pro bono', that's it.

42:31.834 --> 42:33.400
And my 10 years?

42:33.901 --> 42:36.700
The 10 years I spent in prison.

42:43.101 --> 42:44.766
Wait, where you off to?

42:44.767 --> 42:45.900
Move aside.

42:45.901 --> 42:47.499
Where are you going?

42:47.500 --> 42:48.901
Goddammit.

42:50.400 --> 42:53.667
I'm too old to be taking your attitude.

42:54.600 --> 42:57.034

43:00.934 --> 43:01.767
Excuse me?

43:01.768 --> 43:05.100
He's a killer who served 10 years,

43:05.101 --> 43:06.466
he says he will kill me.

43:06.467 --> 43:09.901
Could you call the police?

43:21.290 --> 43:23.722
What could they be thinking?

43:24.276 --> 43:25.742
There's nothing to it.

43:25.767 --> 43:27.699
'I wish he wouldn't come near me.'

43:27.700 --> 43:29.734
'Why did they release him?'

43:30.332 --> 43:32.366
'Shoulda given him the death penalty.'

43:33.423 --> 43:36.023
Will you live until the end as a killer?

43:37.508 --> 43:39.109
Want to go back to prison?

43:39.134 --> 43:42.599
It's better than out here.

43:42.600 --> 43:45.800
You're a selfish bastard.

43:46.369 --> 43:47.469
What?

43:47.578 --> 43:49.511
What about your mother?

43:49.826 --> 43:51.960
Did you ever think about her?

43:52.509 --> 43:56.542
She's blind but she works everyday!

43:56.785 --> 43:59.685
Will you let her live alone?

44:09.036 --> 44:10.403
Damn it...

44:12.433 --> 44:15.867
He's a good friend, he can be a bit...

44:17.837 --> 44:20.237
Where's the manager?

44:20.500 --> 44:22.667
Sorry about that, take care.

44:23.700 --> 44:25.833
We get one shot at this.

44:25.834 --> 44:27.766
We can't reapply on same grounds!

44:27.767 --> 44:30.666
What do you think you're doing?

44:30.667 --> 44:36.867
You ungrateful bastard! I'm talking to you!

44:40.901 --> 44:43.866
What are you looking at?

44:43.867 --> 44:47.000
Want to go? Alright.

44:47.001 --> 44:48.799
Let's do this, okay.

44:48.800 --> 44:52.433
Let's see who goes down first,
there's one way to find out.

45:03.025 --> 45:05.159
Show it to me.

45:05.184 --> 45:06.251
What?

45:06.276 --> 45:07.842
The police report!

45:08.109 --> 45:09.276
Right.

45:13.563 --> 45:14.696
Here.

45:17.764 --> 45:19.998
Take the knife from the compartment.

45:20.634 --> 45:21.700
Hurry up.

45:22.034 --> 45:23.467
Take it out.

45:24.259 --> 45:26.725
Get in the cab, come here.

45:29.020 --> 45:30.254
And stab.

45:34.471 --> 45:36.338
Go on, you fuck.

45:36.517 --> 45:38.684
He'll never make it as an actor.

45:38.709 --> 45:41.876
Not the waist, you stabbed
back of his neck.

45:41.901 --> 45:43.734
<i>Do what you did before.</i>

45:47.761 --> 45:48.828
Alright...

46:04.418 --> 46:05.917
Hey,

46:05.942 --> 46:08.942
do you have a stopwatch?

46:08.967 --> 46:10.399
Stopwatch?

46:10.400 --> 46:12.833
What did you think I was doing just now?

46:12.834 --> 46:15.967
Yeah, I got a stopwatch.

46:17.670 --> 46:18.870
Time me.

46:24.585 --> 46:30.652

<i>The taxi meter stopped at 2:08 AM.</i>

46:40.226 --> 46:42.660
<i>- He can't kill while on the phone...
- Don't cut me off!</i>

<i>- That leaves 1:40.

46:46.443 --> 46:49.210

46:49.235 --> 46:50.368
Goddammit!

46:52.911 --> 46:55.345
I don't got no daddy like you, asshole!

46:55.644 --> 46:56.644
What's that?

46:57.400 --> 46:59.800
No! No!

47:01.400 --> 47:02.900
Open up!

47:02.901 --> 47:05.000

47:05.001 --> 47:07.399
Help! 5775! It's a robbery!

47:07.400 --> 47:08.967
Help!

47:32.950 --> 47:38.984
<i>The autopsy stated that the knife
could get stuck between the ribs.</i>

47:39.696 --> 47:41.796

47:59.362 --> 48:00.496
Jesus!

48:01.737 --> 48:03.370
Time?

48:06.211 --> 48:08.144
Can you go again?

48:40.454 --> 48:43.454
It's all made up.

48:51.782 --> 48:54.549
<i>Fame Motel</i>

48:57.331 --> 48:59.398
This is where you were interrogated?

49:00.164 --> 49:03.265
Not at the station,
but an abandoned motel?

49:28.211 --> 49:29.810
<i>Confession</i>

49:49.727 --> 49:51.560
Bastards...

50:07.201 --> 50:08.401
Shall we go?

50:19.334 --> 50:21.766
Pulmonary artery sprays blood like crazy.

50:21.767 --> 50:24.232
But nothing was detected with luminol.

50:24.233 --> 50:26.600
This shoddy work wasn't
verified by the D.A.

50:26.601 --> 50:28.166
Wow, you're onto something.

50:28.167 --> 50:30.299
Is this enough for a retrial?

50:30.300 --> 50:31.533
- No.
- No?

50:31.534 --> 50:32.434
- No.
- Why?

50:32.435 --> 50:35.533
This proves that the cops
and D.A. were incompetent.

50:35.534 --> 50:39.367
But it doesn't prove that
he wasn't the killer.

50:40.334 --> 50:44.267
Only if I can find the real killer...

50:44.767 --> 50:46.867
The statute of limitations
is coming up soon.

50:48.767 --> 50:50.133
What's with you?

50:50.367 --> 50:50.932
About what?

50:50.957 --> 50:53.723
Since when were you
so vested in your clients?

50:57.133 --> 50:59.701
You went too far,
we're just legal counselors.

51:00.500 --> 51:01.701
Right.

51:03.133 --> 51:04.434
Indeed.

51:10.367 --> 51:12.167
I'd like to apologize, sir.

51:13.701 --> 51:16.467
Forget it, you left on your own feet.

51:30.998 --> 51:32.164
What are you doing?

51:33.075 --> 51:36.175
Please let me work again.

51:36.200 --> 51:38.767
I have to make some money.

51:41.982 --> 51:44.748
Give me a chance, and if I'm useless...

51:46.901 --> 51:48.768
I'll never come back again.

51:56.167 --> 51:57.299
Good afternoon, ma'am.

51:57.300 --> 51:59.700
We've met before,
I'm attorney Lee Joon-young.

51:59.701 --> 52:03.601
My lawyer's here!

52:04.534 --> 52:07.667
So lawyers look like that?

52:07.801 --> 52:10.734
Did you think they'd have horns?

52:11.200 --> 52:15.300
I need consultation, could you help?

52:15.567 --> 52:18.633
I'm sorry, I'm a bit busy.

52:18.634 --> 52:23.100
I saw my hubby's texts by accident...

52:23.593 --> 52:24.694
Did he cheat?

52:25.100 --> 52:27.099
She called the bitch

52:27.100 --> 52:29.834
but got ignored because
she's a business woman.

52:30.634 --> 52:34.733
These cheaters deserve
to be stoned to death.

52:34.734 --> 52:36.601
Where is he? We can get him back.

52:37.767 --> 52:39.133
You ladies wait here.

52:39.734 --> 52:41.766
I'm going to carve him to pieces!

52:41.767 --> 52:43.666
Let's go!

52:43.667 --> 52:45.666
Ma'am, please calm down.

52:45.667 --> 52:47.701
We can settle this legally.

52:48.167 --> 52:50.367
How?

52:51.701 --> 52:56.133
I'll go to the court and file
a provisional attachment.

52:56.233 --> 52:57.667
What's that?

52:57.734 --> 53:01.866
She will only receive half of her salary,

53:01.867 --> 53:04.100
and you'll get the rest as alimony.

53:04.167 --> 53:05.466
Is that true?

53:05.467 --> 53:06.434
Of course!

53:06.435 --> 53:11.200
She'll be mocked at work,
and you get paid too.

53:11.567 --> 53:15.400
That's amazing, clap your hands!

53:17.200 --> 53:19.767
Clap harder!

53:21.167 --> 53:22.601
He's amazing!

53:33.601 --> 53:35.701
So you slipped in the sauna?

53:35.801 --> 53:38.567
But they won't compensate
because they got a warning sign?

53:39.200 --> 53:41.767
T-t-t-that's right.

53:44.734 --> 53:46.100
Let's go have a drink!

53:54.267 --> 53:57.766
I got a surgery but I'm worried
about medical accident.

53:57.767 --> 53:59.834
Of course, what kind of surgery?

54:01.167 --> 54:02.366
You know.

54:02.367 --> 54:03.233
What?

54:03.234 --> 54:04.566
Circumcision!

54:04.567 --> 54:05.801
You little rascal!

54:07.767 --> 54:09.100
Take your pants off.

54:10.567 --> 54:11.667
Come back!

54:18.801 --> 54:20.367
I should've refused.

54:21.400 --> 54:22.467
What are those?

54:22.601 --> 54:23.601
Retainer.

54:25.267 --> 54:27.667
I'm so tired. That was crazy.

54:32.021 --> 54:33.721
Why did you become a lawyer?

54:34.534 --> 54:36.334
You know, somehow.

54:37.860 --> 54:41.760
When I was young, I sucked at studying.

54:42.882 --> 54:44.648
I went to an occupational high school.

54:46.133 --> 54:47.734
I had fun.

54:48.567 --> 54:52.300
Got into plenty of fights,
ran away home to Seoul.

54:53.334 --> 54:57.701
When I was a senior,
I had over a hundred absents,

54:58.467 --> 55:01.367
and my teacher wrote in my record,

55:03.167 --> 55:05.133
"Lacks law-abiding spirit."

55:07.767 --> 55:11.500
I had this urge to prove him wrong.

55:12.367 --> 55:15.334
So after my military service,
I started prepping for the bar.

55:16.092 --> 55:17.825
I wanted to go out with a bang.

55:17.850 --> 55:19.950
So? Did you?

55:20.601 --> 55:23.601
Isn't it obvious?
I'm on a killer's retrial case.

55:28.952 --> 55:30.085
Nice.

55:31.250 --> 55:32.984
So calm.

55:39.225 --> 55:40.625
What's this?

55:41.334 --> 55:42.601
Retainer?

55:43.662 --> 55:44.996
My entire savings.

55:50.267 --> 55:52.534
Okay, thanks.

55:56.593 --> 55:57.593
Buddy!

56:00.913 --> 56:03.412
I'm your lawyer now.

56:05.534 --> 56:06.801
Survey report

56:23.041 --> 56:26.008
It's the octopus from earlier.

56:26.701 --> 56:27.701
Eat it.

56:28.367 --> 56:29.367
For me?

56:48.792 --> 56:52.659
Yakchon Junction

57:02.734 --> 57:03.634
Good work.

57:03.734 --> 57:05.434
You too, dude.

57:07.340 --> 57:09.007
What a prick.

57:10.334 --> 57:12.267
Article 420 of the Constitution,

57:12.767 --> 57:16.367
a new piece of evidence is
the focal point of a new trial.

57:16.767 --> 57:19.267
Hard evidence is best, but if not...

57:19.367 --> 57:21.434
- A witness.
- Very good!

57:22.810 --> 57:26.376
Did you meet anyone
when the murder took place?

57:28.475 --> 57:29.475
Why?

57:29.667 --> 57:33.400
If you were with someone,
you couldn't be the killer.

57:33.767 --> 57:34.767
Use your head.

57:39.334 --> 57:40.334
There was.

57:41.467 --> 57:42.500
Who?

57:47.272 --> 57:48.272
Open up.

57:49.200 --> 57:52.442
Open this right now! You fucking bitch!

57:52.467 --> 57:54.133
Can't I just work here?

57:54.601 --> 57:58.100
Are you looking down on the islanders?

57:58.878 --> 58:00.745
People live there too.

58:01.300 --> 58:02.567
Open up!

58:03.029 --> 58:06.895
Open, open, open! Bitch!

58:07.736 --> 58:10.335
You can't even fuck men,
what good are you?

58:10.367 --> 58:12.867
How will you pay back
the money I lend you?

58:18.663 --> 58:19.663
Bitch.

58:22.435 --> 58:23.834
Get out, you bastard!

58:23.975 --> 58:24.975
Are you nuts?

58:27.353 --> 58:28.553
Fucking bitch.

58:34.919 --> 58:35.919
Fucking hell.

58:44.029 --> 58:45.029
What the!

58:49.242 --> 58:50.242
No!

58:50.342 --> 58:51.442
- Stop it!
- Let me go!

58:51.467 --> 58:52.833
I'm going to kill that bastard!

58:52.834 --> 58:55.233
Drop it! Drop the knife!

58:57.021 --> 58:59.187
Go! Leave!

59:04.209 --> 59:06.309
Didn't I tell you to quit that job?!

59:06.872 --> 59:08.805
You wanted to live a normal life!

59:09.034 --> 59:10.834
And hit the books and go to college!

59:12.828 --> 59:14.029
GED Prep

59:21.318 --> 59:22.351
You should keep it.

59:23.341 --> 59:25.174
Let's meet again in college.

59:58.233 --> 01:00:00.799
So on the way home that night,

01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:03.268
you met the detectives.

01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:08.017
What was her name?

01:00:09.709 --> 01:00:10.776
Su-jung, I think.

01:00:11.542 --> 01:00:13.275
Don't know her last name, nor age.

01:00:13.721 --> 01:00:17.688
Girls in that line of work use fake names.

01:00:27.071 --> 01:00:28.771
District Attorney Choi?

01:00:29.414 --> 01:00:31.914
Yes, I'm here to see Mr. Gu.

01:00:33.371 --> 01:00:35.803
He's a prosecutor on the fast track.

01:00:36.609 --> 01:00:37.776
No need to rattle his cage.

01:00:38.402 --> 01:00:40.101
Joon-young is doing well.

01:00:40.374 --> 01:00:41.408
With a little push...

01:00:41.433 --> 01:00:44.266
Mo, this is a petty crime case.

01:00:44.777 --> 01:00:47.144
No good outcome will come out of this.

01:00:48.255 --> 01:00:51.155
Why do flies go for shit,
and bees flowers?

01:00:55.348 --> 01:00:56.348
Where is he?

01:00:57.218 --> 01:00:58.218
Mr. Lee.

01:01:02.251 --> 01:01:03.251
Yes, sir.

01:01:10.604 --> 01:01:13.604
I didn't expect a snake to
emerge during landscaping.

01:01:14.645 --> 01:01:15.879
Is that so?

01:01:17.425 --> 01:01:20.191
Mr. Gu, I must be the snake then.

01:01:20.473 --> 01:01:21.473
Of course not.

01:01:21.941 --> 01:01:24.108
Definitely not more than that.

01:01:24.648 --> 01:01:26.249
Buddy, who sent you?

01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:27.786
Watch your mouth.

01:01:30.611 --> 01:01:34.245
The D.A. of the original trial
came to stop the new trial.

01:01:36.299 --> 01:01:39.166
Had you read through the fake report,

01:01:39.191 --> 01:01:40.491
Cho wouldn't have served.

01:01:40.621 --> 01:01:41.987
I said watch your mouth!

01:01:42.843 --> 01:01:47.642
A lawyer's greatest enemy
is the lawyer of future.

01:01:48.384 --> 01:01:50.184
That's a great quote. Who said that?

01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:52.753
You did, during a mock trial.

01:01:53.075 --> 01:01:55.242
Yeah? What was the outcome?

01:01:55.776 --> 01:01:59.111
We won, you brought their lawyer to tears.

01:01:59.136 --> 01:02:01.269
Yeah, I remember.

01:02:01.294 --> 01:02:02.955
What are you two doing?!

01:02:03.332 --> 01:02:04.898
In front of a VIP, no less.

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:09.857
No, it's quite alright.

01:02:12.365 --> 01:02:18.764
I heard you're job hunting,
I'm starting a firm soon.

01:02:19.847 --> 01:02:21.281
Give me a call if you're up for it.

01:02:21.775 --> 01:02:22.775
Keep it.

01:02:23.229 --> 01:02:27.229
I may be a scumbag,
but I don't sell out my client.

01:02:37.865 --> 01:02:40.732
Copy of a letter Cho wrote
in prison to the detectives.

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:45.624
A trial can't be won with just passion.

01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:54.057
I said not to rattle his cage.

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:00.539
That was nerve-racking.

01:03:01.615 --> 01:03:03.582
D.A.s are scary.

01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:11.144
<i>Hello, Det. Baek Cheol-ki.</i>

01:03:12.621 --> 01:03:17.354
<i>I'd like to sincerely
apologize for all the lies.</i>

01:03:18.479 --> 01:03:24.246
<i>Like you said, I like to
think of this as early enlistment.</i>

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:31.587
<i>Thank you for putting me
on the right track again.</i>

01:03:36.625 --> 01:03:38.525
<i>Lee Joon-young</i>

01:03:39.531 --> 01:03:41.064
What's up?

01:03:42.182 --> 01:03:43.549
What's with the letter?

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:44.375
What letter?

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.120
The letter you wrote
to the cops in prison.

01:03:48.145 --> 01:03:49.145
Letter?

01:03:50.306 --> 01:03:51.439
<i>Answer me.</i>

01:03:51.895 --> 01:03:52.895
Hello?

01:03:53.569 --> 01:03:55.702
I had to write it, I had no choice.

01:03:55.727 --> 01:03:58.894
You're not the killer, so why did you?

01:04:01.082 --> 01:04:05.616
If you don't believe me,
you should've let me alone!

01:04:05.988 --> 01:04:07.888
Listen to this bastard.

01:04:08.412 --> 01:04:10.412
Cho Hyun-woo. Hello?

01:04:28.844 --> 01:04:32.177
I'm looking for Lee Joon-young.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.979
I knew this would happen.

01:04:36.201 --> 01:04:37.601
Let's end this case here.

01:04:38.946 --> 01:04:40.246
I still can't believe it.

01:04:41.352 --> 01:04:43.285
His acting can't be that good.

01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:49.810
What are you doing?

01:04:49.835 --> 01:04:52.868
My client stabbed me for losing the trial.

01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:56.590
Clients lie to their lawyers all the time.

01:04:58.857 --> 01:05:00.224
Get some rest since you're here.

01:05:01.454 --> 01:05:04.521
It's only a fractured rib.

01:05:23.413 --> 01:05:24.613
15 years?

01:05:25.342 --> 01:05:27.842
There's only one way
to reduce the sentence.

01:05:28.509 --> 01:05:29.509
What is that?

01:05:30.249 --> 01:05:31.815
He must admit his crime.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.873
He didn't kill anyone, why would he?

01:05:34.939 --> 01:05:37.140
Even if you appeal, it's a lost cause.

01:05:37.568 --> 01:05:40.168
If you show remorse...

01:05:40.193 --> 01:05:42.126
You douchebag!

01:05:42.776 --> 01:05:45.409
Are you working with them?

01:05:45.434 --> 01:05:47.098
You prick!

01:05:47.123 --> 01:05:48.123
I'll do it!

01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:53.182
I'll admit to it.

01:05:55.043 --> 01:05:57.810
Mom, let's stop this.

01:05:59.237 --> 01:06:00.903
How long must we do this?

01:06:02.485 --> 01:06:06.552
You can't even see right
with diabetes or whatever!

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.200
No way.

01:06:09.982 --> 01:06:11.383
Don't take this prick's word.

01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:16.085
What should I do? Tell me what to do.

01:06:16.258 --> 01:06:17.258
No!

01:06:17.528 --> 01:06:20.194
Start with a letter of apology
to the judge.

01:06:20.219 --> 01:06:20.986
Okay.

01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:22.877
Another to the detectives.

01:06:22.902 --> 01:06:23.902
Okay...

01:06:24.774 --> 01:06:26.541
This is utter nonsense.

01:06:31.081 --> 01:06:32.081
Never!

01:06:44.229 --> 01:06:45.229
What is it?

01:06:45.439 --> 01:06:46.439
What's going on?

01:06:53.859 --> 01:06:55.626
That thing we talked about.

01:07:10.351 --> 01:07:12.584
<i>Suwon City, Sinjung District 186-3</i>

01:07:12.609 --> 01:07:15.609
Why look for her all of sudden?

01:07:16.618 --> 01:07:17.618
Are you...

01:07:19.110 --> 01:07:20.143
lonely nowadays?

01:07:21.974 --> 01:07:24.375
Okay, okay, I'm leaving. Jeez.

01:07:25.267 --> 01:07:27.000
Get the fuck out!

01:07:27.725 --> 01:07:28.725
Bye!

01:07:46.514 --> 01:07:48.518
<i>Lee Joon-young</i>

01:08:28.156 --> 01:08:29.689
Welcome.

01:08:43.022 --> 01:08:44.055
It's been a while.

01:08:45.823 --> 01:08:47.557
I heard about what happened.

01:08:48.828 --> 01:08:50.895
I never believed that you did it.

01:08:53.365 --> 01:08:54.365
Um...

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:56.880
Could you...

01:08:58.703 --> 01:09:01.069
become a witness?

01:09:02.843 --> 01:09:03.843
Witness?

01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:06.341
Just tell them,

01:09:07.194 --> 01:09:09.261
you were with me
when the murder took place.

01:09:15.997 --> 01:09:16.997
You must be busy.

01:09:18.712 --> 01:09:19.712
You are.

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:25.167
Could I come back after you close?

01:09:32.518 --> 01:09:33.952
<i>I still sell drinks.</i>

01:09:34.774 --> 01:09:36.642
<i>I'm not ashamed now.</i>

01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:40.113
<i>But where we worked was different.</i>

01:09:40.582 --> 01:09:41.982
<i>What if people find out?</i>

01:09:43.131 --> 01:09:45.599
<i>I didn't even think to visit you.</i>

01:09:50.871 --> 01:09:51.871
Hyun-woo!

01:09:52.866 --> 01:09:54.465
Yeah? What is it?

01:09:58.218 --> 01:10:02.185
About 3 years or so
after you went to prison...

01:10:05.289 --> 01:10:07.356
Something happened in Kunsan.

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:23.120
Sir, remember me?

01:10:30.718 --> 01:10:34.751
I heard the youngsters
call this country 'Hell Korea'.

01:10:40.449 --> 01:10:42.516
At least it's fair in hell.

01:10:43.207 --> 01:10:45.740
You only get punished for what you did.

01:10:46.984 --> 01:10:49.517
<i>3 years after the murder</i>

01:10:49.542 --> 01:10:50.576
Give me a second.

01:10:51.876 --> 01:10:53.709
This is Kunsan Precinct.

01:10:54.475 --> 01:10:57.275
<i>I... know who the real killer is.</i>

01:10:58.510 --> 01:10:59.510
What?

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.867
<i>The one who killed the Yakchon cabby.</i>

01:11:12.695 --> 01:11:13.762
Gangnam night view.

01:11:16.137 --> 01:11:17.137
How is it?

01:11:17.391 --> 01:11:19.525
What is this place?

01:11:19.793 --> 01:11:21.612
I'm thinking of starting my own firm.

01:11:21.637 --> 01:11:24.403
I hooked a big M&A case
that I've been working on.

01:11:24.584 --> 01:11:25.718
Seriously?

01:11:26.451 --> 01:11:28.351
Congrats!

01:11:29.898 --> 01:11:31.497
And talk about hiring you.

01:11:32.179 --> 01:11:33.013
Hire me?

01:11:33.038 --> 01:11:36.113
You wanted one big score to make a mark.

01:11:36.138 --> 01:11:37.570
Let's do it together, right here.

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:43.665
<i>Cho Hyun-woo</i>

01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:45.341
Don't answer.

01:11:47.425 --> 01:11:50.224
We should drink till the morning.

01:11:50.249 --> 01:11:51.249
How about it?

01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:57.545
You've changed.

01:11:58.126 --> 01:11:59.126
Me?

01:12:04.922 --> 01:12:06.655
I said don't answer.

01:12:07.276 --> 01:12:09.119
I'll tell him not to call me again.

01:12:11.358 --> 01:12:12.058
Hello?

01:12:12.185 --> 01:12:13.618
<i>I found the real killer.</i>

01:12:13.643 --> 01:12:14.643
What?

01:12:14.729 --> 01:12:16.729
<i>I know where the real killer is!</i>

01:12:17.442 --> 01:12:19.442
<i>Ilsan Car Dealership</i>

01:12:20.748 --> 01:12:22.115
No pressure to make a purchase.

01:12:22.639 --> 01:12:26.372
But I think this car suits your style.

01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:37.686
It's been a long time.

01:12:37.966 --> 01:12:39.565
You look really good.

01:12:56.893 --> 01:13:00.060
That's enough, or I might kill you.

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:03.442
Go on, kill me.

01:13:04.553 --> 01:13:05.887
That's what you do best.

01:13:07.887 --> 01:13:09.954
Sir, I'll call the cops!

01:13:10.534 --> 01:13:11.567
Shut the fuck up!

01:13:13.452 --> 01:13:14.452
Stop!

01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:55.057
What the fuck!

01:14:56.068 --> 01:14:57.068
Back up!

01:14:57.726 --> 01:14:59.260

01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:04.667

Who the fuck are you?

01:15:14.998 --> 01:15:15.998
Me?

01:15:18.965 --> 01:15:19.965
A lawyer.

01:15:29.542 --> 01:15:31.542
Lawyer! That's perfect.

01:15:31.567 --> 01:15:33.168
I want to sue this guy.

01:15:33.905 --> 01:15:36.272
I'll pay you a lot, so take care of him!

01:15:36.297 --> 01:15:39.863
Yeah? I get to make money for once.

01:15:40.793 --> 01:15:43.826
Okay, I'll decide in 10 minutes.

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:45.874
Decide what?

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:47.375
Whether to represent you,

01:15:48.891 --> 01:15:49.925
or represent him.

01:15:51.184 --> 01:15:53.484
I got nothing to say.

01:15:54.985 --> 01:15:56.684
Wait, Mr. Lawyer!

01:15:56.724 --> 01:15:59.691
Do you know what you learn in prison?

01:16:02.130 --> 01:16:04.796
Things you should never learn, you fuck!

01:16:08.369 --> 01:16:09.369
I'll talk!

01:16:10.403 --> 01:16:11.436
I'll spill it!

01:16:21.359 --> 01:16:26.193
If you needed money, you
should've gotten a job.

01:16:28.852 --> 01:16:30.252
Get rid of this for me.

01:16:32.842 --> 01:16:33.976
Me?

01:16:36.379 --> 01:16:37.678
Why should I?

01:16:37.755 --> 01:16:41.721
Gonna ignore your friend in need?

01:16:48.441 --> 01:16:50.507
Having killed a person,

01:16:54.115 --> 01:16:55.815
I realized that it's no big deal.

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:57.453
Did you sniff glue again?

01:17:01.608 --> 01:17:02.708
<i>Confession</i>

01:17:02.733 --> 01:17:04.833
I told you we should've
turned ourselves in sooner.

01:17:06.542 --> 01:17:10.709
I can't live with this
on my hands anymore.

01:17:12.449 --> 01:17:13.482
Spill it.

01:17:13.828 --> 01:17:15.695
Or you're arrested
for harboring a criminal.

01:17:16.375 --> 01:17:18.975
I tossed the knife in the dumping ground.

01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:21.113
How dare you report me?

01:17:24.569 --> 01:17:26.735
Son of a bitch! Grab him!

01:17:27.642 --> 01:17:30.176
1 case, 2 killers.

01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:35.084
Police coercion and
irresponsible prosecutor.

01:17:39.298 --> 01:17:40.831
The tabloids will love this.

01:17:42.775 --> 01:17:47.075
Well, we didn't do this
only for my benefit.

01:17:48.654 --> 01:17:49.922
You know that.

01:17:53.242 --> 01:17:54.242
At attention!

01:17:55.662 --> 01:17:57.429
At attention, asshole!

01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:02.423
I didn't rot in the boonies

01:18:05.932 --> 01:18:08.799
to go down with a small time hooligan.

01:18:11.639 --> 01:18:12.872
I'll do whatever it takes.

01:18:18.411 --> 01:18:19.445
Sit up.

01:18:20.285 --> 01:18:22.419
Sit up straight.

01:18:25.718 --> 01:18:28.718
I killed him, I really did.

01:18:30.093 --> 01:18:31.959
I confessed to everything.

01:18:32.772 --> 01:18:33.939
I'll go to prison.

01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:37.317
This guy's funny, not
everyone can go to prison.

01:18:37.342 --> 01:18:38.842
We have to let you.

01:18:40.699 --> 01:18:41.699
Don't you sniff glue too?

01:18:41.849 --> 01:18:42.849
What?

01:18:43.042 --> 01:18:45.842
You like sniffing glue, right?

01:18:45.867 --> 01:18:46.867
No...

01:18:47.152 --> 01:18:49.152
Son of a whore.

01:18:49.318 --> 01:18:50.951
Just say you do, fuckface.

01:18:51.428 --> 01:18:52.428
If you don't,

01:18:53.444 --> 01:18:54.444
we're both dead.

01:18:56.410 --> 01:18:57.410
I love it.

01:18:57.982 --> 01:19:01.449
Good, say that you sniffed together.

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:04.037
And lied about the confession.

01:19:04.216 --> 01:19:06.983
We settled things with your folks too.

01:19:07.828 --> 01:19:12.195
Get some rest in a mental hospital.

01:19:13.063 --> 01:19:14.063
Got it?

01:19:16.136 --> 01:19:17.136
<i>Then what?</i>

01:19:17.803 --> 01:19:20.703
<i>I was a fake patient for 2 or 3 months.</i>

01:19:22.284 --> 01:19:26.590
<i>They all looked for the knife.</i>

01:19:26.615 --> 01:19:27.615
I understand.

01:19:30.261 --> 01:19:32.894
Chief, I got a call from the station.

01:19:33.315 --> 01:19:34.815
Are they sending us support?

01:19:34.996 --> 01:19:35.996
No, the warrant...

01:19:37.635 --> 01:19:42.902
was overturned, so they want
us to halt the investigation.

01:19:44.097 --> 01:19:45.363
What did you say?

01:19:46.009 --> 01:19:47.481
We can get him, so why aren't we?

01:19:50.557 --> 01:19:51.757
We have him...

01:20:01.118 --> 01:20:02.885
<i>Insufficient evidence, they said.</i>

01:20:05.622 --> 01:20:12.555
I told them I'm the killer,
but the cops let me go.

01:20:13.416 --> 01:20:14.938
And your friend?

01:20:14.963 --> 01:20:19.368
The one in psych ward, where is he?

01:20:26.495 --> 01:20:28.148
<i>That fuck...</i>

01:20:29.464 --> 01:20:32.735
Depression or some shit.

01:20:33.903 --> 01:20:35.211
Asshole.

01:20:36.015 --> 01:20:37.625
What will you do?

01:20:37.876 --> 01:20:40.918
Kill him? Or get the police?

01:20:41.352 --> 01:20:45.309
He'll be freed again
for insufficient evident, no?!

01:20:55.407 --> 01:20:58.073
You think this is over? Not at all.

01:21:01.501 --> 01:21:03.549
We'll meet again in court.

01:21:15.417 --> 01:21:17.199
Thank you.

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:20.709
We're ready to shoot.

01:21:27.083 --> 01:21:28.083
Morning.

01:21:28.501 --> 01:21:29.540
What are you doing?

01:21:29.565 --> 01:21:30.884
What do you think?

01:21:30.909 --> 01:21:34.242
No good will come out of
making big deal of this case...

01:21:34.267 --> 01:21:36.517
What's going on? Something wrong?

01:21:36.542 --> 01:21:37.517
I'm sorry, sir.

01:21:37.542 --> 01:21:38.959
No problem.

01:21:39.667 --> 01:21:42.747
I got the make-up
and wardrobe departments.

01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:45.893
- Here.
- Thank you.

01:21:45.918 --> 01:21:48.626
Producer Lee, get me a 2-shot later.

01:21:50.626 --> 01:21:56.834
And make sure to get
a close up of our logo.

01:21:58.042 --> 01:22:00.887
It's okay, don't worry.

01:22:08.042 --> 01:22:10.083
You look good in that.

01:22:11.417 --> 01:22:14.834
I feel awkward in this.

01:22:15.644 --> 01:22:18.894
Okay, good. Button up.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.364
Look in the mirror.

01:22:23.552 --> 01:22:25.918
Very nice.

01:22:27.292 --> 01:22:29.857
You look like a movie star.

01:22:33.501 --> 01:22:34.501
What?

01:22:35.542 --> 01:22:37.228
You look good.

01:22:45.814 --> 01:22:46.595
It's Dad.

01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:48.416
<i>With newly surfaced evidence...</i>

01:22:48.441 --> 01:22:50.686
My gosh, it's really him.

01:22:50.725 --> 01:22:53.642
Come out! He's on TV!

01:22:53.667 --> 01:22:55.409
<i>Apply for a new trial.</i>

01:22:55.434 --> 01:22:57.714
What did he do now?

01:22:58.315 --> 01:23:03.412
<i>We need indisputable evidence,
and a witness who didn't testify</i>

01:23:03.437 --> 01:23:07.656
<i>- Look how good he looks.
- in the original trial.</i>

01:23:07.751 --> 01:23:14.477
<i>A new witness is the sole hope
for Cho Hyun-woo and his family.</i>

01:23:14.751 --> 01:23:19.637
<i>If there is a witness, be courageous.</i>

<i>Please help us.</i>

01:23:22.042 --> 01:23:25.584
<i>You are their only hope.</i>

01:23:29.667 --> 01:23:31.042
Stay there!

01:23:32.209 --> 01:23:35.083
What are you doing there?

01:23:39.751 --> 01:23:42.559
- Listen carefully.
- Okay.

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:44.542
Attach the hook to the rope.

01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:47.584
You can safely get here from home.

01:23:48.167 --> 01:23:50.875
My baby is a genius.

01:23:50.876 --> 01:23:54.542
How did you ever think of this?

01:23:55.751 --> 01:23:58.104
I'm going to get GED.

01:23:58.876 --> 01:23:59.876
Really?

01:24:01.417 --> 01:24:03.501
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

01:24:04.167 --> 01:24:07.375
Thank you, thank you so much.

01:24:07.445 --> 01:24:09.357
Don't thank me.

01:24:09.584 --> 01:24:12.248
Not you idiot, your lawyer.

01:24:13.083 --> 01:24:14.936
Right, my lawyer.

01:24:16.375 --> 01:24:19.876
Did you just laugh?

01:24:24.209 --> 01:24:25.818
My baby.

01:24:26.667 --> 01:24:28.626
You really did laugh, right?

01:24:30.751 --> 01:24:32.834
You were laughing.

01:24:33.876 --> 01:24:36.459
I had something on my face,
I got more work to do.

01:24:36.667 --> 01:24:38.334

- Mr. Lee!
- Yes?

I understand, okay.

01:25:29.985 --> 01:25:30.985

01:26:09.167 --> 01:26:11.083
Hello there.

01:26:11.459 --> 01:26:14.016
I can still remember it clearly.

01:26:14.167 --> 01:26:17.083
Even after a decade, I can't forget it.

01:26:18.042 --> 01:26:23.083
I was standing by to help
someone moonlight flit.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.292

It's done, let's get moving.

01:26:43.709 --> 01:26:46.124
Did you happen to see

01:26:46.125 --> 01:26:49.334
a motorcycle or a scooter near the cab?

01:26:49.751 --> 01:26:51.412
Nothing nearby.

01:26:51.667 --> 01:26:53.307
Why didn't you call in with the tip then?

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:55.250
I did, how could I not?

01:26:55.542 --> 01:27:00.083
But the cops refused
to listen to me at all.

01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:04.459
I felt bad, it always stuck with me.

- It's over.
- Mom, it's done.

read him the Miranda rights,

01:27:44.210 --> 01:27:46.250
Possession of obscene
material and what else?

01:27:46.292 --> 01:27:48.626
Prostitution and gambling.

- Wait a minute!
- Let him go!

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.626

01:28:04.834 --> 01:28:06.208

01:29:16.276 --> 01:29:17.792
but we're safe.

01:29:18.501 --> 01:29:20.876
Chairman Park put in a good word for you.

01:29:21.546 --> 01:29:23.755
He acquired this golf course

$342 million.

01:29:28.935 --> 01:29:32.351
With proper title examination,
this type of risk is easy.

01:29:32.926 --> 01:29:34.675
The commission is 8%...

01:29:34.717 --> 01:29:36.592
$27.3 million.

01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:39.259
Enough capital to start a firm.

01:29:40.176 --> 01:29:41.675
Head of a firm...

01:29:44.176 --> 01:29:47.134
No need to think hard,
we're helping each other.

01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:54.425

01:31:12.425 --> 01:31:13.400

And that making money is the priority!

01:31:19.892 --> 01:31:22.267
I'll compensate him enough to start over.

01:31:23.342 --> 01:31:26.717

there's no new trial.

01:31:28.218 --> 01:31:29.218

What is best for the client?

01:31:31.792 --> 01:31:35.098
A new trial with no chance?
Or guaranteed money?

01:31:36.017 --> 01:31:38.542
How could you do this to me?

01:31:38.771 --> 01:31:40.979
Aren't you even sorry for me?

01:31:47.467 --> 01:31:48.759
I am.

01:31:53.235 --> 01:31:56.443
But like you said,
lawyers don't apologize.

01:31:59.634 --> 01:32:00.634
Let's work together.

01:32:01.459 --> 01:32:04.051

Okay, fine, let's go inside.

01:32:37.675 --> 01:32:39.342
Go! Just leave!

01:32:39.842 --> 01:32:43.717
With a son like you by my side,
I could never rest easy.

01:32:44.259 --> 01:32:48.759
After you're gone, I could finally live.

01:32:48.954 --> 01:32:49.954

This is the only way.

01:32:56.675 --> 01:32:58.176
Don't ever come back.

01:32:59.168 --> 01:33:03.834
Go! Right this moment! Leave me alone!

01:33:04.425 --> 01:33:06.259

01:33:09.425 --> 01:33:11.092
Mom, please...

01:33:17.954 --> 01:33:20.037
Mom, open this door.

01:33:25.230 --> 01:33:28.232
What am I supposed to do?!

01:33:29.759 --> 01:33:32.967
I'm going mad! I really am...

01:33:34.259 --> 01:33:35.259
Mom...

01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:41.383
Mom!

01:34:07.798 --> 01:34:09.623
Motherfuckers!

01:34:11.759 --> 01:34:14.051
Goddamn you!

01:34:45.426 --> 01:34:47.092
Sir? Sir?

01:34:47.954 --> 01:34:50.149
You have to pay first.

01:35:20.641 --> 01:35:24.274
You'd be surprised to find out
that I raise a large shepherd.

01:35:25.278 --> 01:35:28.944
My dog went to a butcher shop
and ate a ton of meat.

01:35:29.659 --> 01:35:30.867
And only A+ quality meat.

01:35:32.867 --> 01:35:34.492
Even a dog knows good meat.

01:35:35.159 --> 01:35:36.909
So the butcher asked me,

01:35:37.992 --> 01:35:41.783
"when a pet damaged goods,
can the owner be billed?"

01:35:42.909 --> 01:35:44.242
I said "you absolutely can."

01:35:45.326 --> 01:35:48.117
Then he asked me for $500.

01:35:49.576 --> 01:35:51.451
It was the cost of meat that my dog ate.

01:35:52.075 --> 01:35:54.867
It's like having a girlfriend,
high maintenance.

01:35:56.534 --> 01:35:59.117
And regrettably, my dog is a female.

01:36:01.992 --> 01:36:04.075
So in this case,

01:36:05.618 --> 01:36:07.950
do you know what I told the butcher?

01:36:08.742 --> 01:36:10.492
You asked him for $500.

01:36:12.409 --> 01:36:14.867
Because your legal consultation
is $1,000 per hour.

01:36:16.367 --> 01:36:17.367
Indeed.

01:36:18.034 --> 01:36:19.034
So...

01:36:19.909 --> 01:36:21.284
why did you sell out the client?

01:36:22.783 --> 01:36:26.451
Like I told you, I was
acting on his best interest.

01:36:26.783 --> 01:36:29.492
What's important to him isn't money.

01:36:30.201 --> 01:36:31.201
Do you understand?

01:36:34.742 --> 01:36:38.159
To live like a man,
we must clear his name!

01:36:38.451 --> 01:36:41.909
To live like a man, he needs money!

01:36:48.367 --> 01:36:49.742
Can we talk later?

01:36:56.326 --> 01:36:57.326
No.

01:36:57.451 --> 01:36:59.367
A lawbreaker needs to be tried.

01:37:01.409 --> 01:37:03.131
Did I break a law?

01:37:03.909 --> 01:37:05.576
Attorney-at-Law Act, Article 26,

01:37:06.492 --> 01:37:10.700
'An attorney must not disclose
confidential matter to a third party.'

01:37:13.159 --> 01:37:14.159
Got proof?

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:16.659
Only you and I knew about
the tipster's number.

01:37:17.242 --> 01:37:19.825
For passing on that tip,
you got a big real estate deal!

01:37:20.825 --> 01:37:21.992
And started a firm, right?

01:37:22.992 --> 01:37:25.909
I told you not to make big presumptions!

01:37:27.242 --> 01:37:30.201
Without an indisputable proof,
no such law exists!

01:37:30.742 --> 01:37:31.783
That's law.

01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:33.992
You're a criminal.

01:37:36.326 --> 01:37:37.700
I warned you.

01:37:37.909 --> 01:37:40.326
Don't mistake common sense with law logic.

01:37:40.534 --> 01:37:43.034
Yeah, you broke a law.

01:37:43.534 --> 01:37:44.749
Which one?

01:37:44.867 --> 01:37:46.159
Attorney-at-Law Act, Article 1,

01:37:47.034 --> 01:37:49.242
'One must defend fundamental human rights,

01:37:50.159 --> 01:37:52.886
and realize social justice.'

01:38:00.492 --> 01:38:02.046
See you soon.

01:38:03.284 --> 01:38:04.825
I'll make sure you're tried.

01:38:09.075 --> 01:38:11.950
Wondering what friends are doing?

01:38:13.201 --> 01:38:16.534
A good lawyer has
less friends than a terrorist.

01:38:17.242 --> 01:38:19.326
So if you need a friend,
raise a dog instead.

01:38:20.492 --> 01:38:21.534
That's today's lesson.

01:38:54.034 --> 01:38:55.326
Mr. Lee?

01:39:00.221 --> 01:39:02.631
May I offer you a job?

01:39:02.997 --> 01:39:05.203
You'll be treated handsomely.

01:39:07.152 --> 01:39:10.027
Sir, don't you get a huge retainer?

01:39:10.997 --> 01:39:12.664
More than you.

01:39:17.992 --> 01:39:19.299

Have you received a man's entire savings?

01:39:23.952 --> 01:39:25.405
Never, right?

01:39:28.695 --> 01:39:30.538
I won.

01:39:36.051 --> 01:39:37.594
Mr. Lee Joon-young.

01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:46.832
Nothing.

01:40:24.729 --> 01:40:26.979
I messed everything up.

01:40:30.371 --> 01:40:31.675
I'm so sorry.

01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:32.991
No need.

01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:38.809
It's my fault for having hope.

01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:46.642
Hyun-woo's gone.

01:40:48.601 --> 01:40:50.018
He won't be back.

Are you... Su-jung?

01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:31.059
Yes, who are you?

01:42:31.142 --> 01:42:32.726
I'm Hyun-woo's lawyer.

01:42:34.059 --> 01:42:35.600
I told him I can't testify.

01:42:35.601 --> 01:42:37.350
Do you know where he is?

01:42:39.142 --> 01:42:40.851
He was here a few weeks ago.

01:42:41.183 --> 01:42:43.309
I explained myself clearly.

01:42:44.601 --> 01:42:46.642
Please leave me alone.

01:42:55.517 --> 01:42:57.003
What now?

01:42:57.183 --> 01:42:58.684
I'm just angry.

01:42:58.976 --> 01:43:00.641
Did I do something wrong?

01:43:00.642 --> 01:43:01.851
No.

01:43:06.267 --> 01:43:08.892
It's because of this moron.

01:43:14.309 --> 01:43:18.434
Why'd he go to save you
and get falsely accused?

01:43:18.767 --> 01:43:22.018
Why would he do such a pointless thing?

01:43:23.225 --> 01:43:25.267
What a moron...

01:43:25.934 --> 01:43:29.059
Now he's trying to become a real killer.

01:43:37.517 --> 01:43:40.225
Let's get moving! Jesus Christ!

01:43:45.367 --> 01:43:46.659
Who the hell?!

01:43:46.684 --> 01:43:48.018
Son of a bitch!

01:43:57.267 --> 01:43:58.601

01:45:06.183 --> 01:45:07.842
Get over here!

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:12.826

viciously attacked law enforcers,

01:46:11.838 --> 01:46:17.851
and the cops fought back in self-defense!

01:46:24.736 --> 01:46:25.945

01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:28.512
Do you feel wronged?

01:46:30.023 --> 01:46:31.856
Son of a bitch.

01:46:33.244 --> 01:46:36.254
Another trip to prison will do you good.

01:46:40.934 --> 01:46:42.434
Look at this bastard.

01:46:43.009 --> 01:46:44.176

Let's talk it over.

01:47:41.267 --> 01:47:42.475
I'm sorry.

01:47:42.559 --> 01:47:45.726
Hyun-woo, I'm sorry.

01:47:45.976 --> 01:47:48.642
It's all my fault.

01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:13.883
Calm down and give me the knife.

01:48:14.402 --> 01:48:18.611
We can resolve this with law.

01:48:19.697 --> 01:48:20.822
Law?

01:48:21.551 --> 01:48:22.884
Law?!

01:48:23.491 --> 01:48:25.117
Are you still on a crusade?

01:48:25.454 --> 01:48:26.996
What can you do with it?

01:48:27.533 --> 01:48:29.742
Can you put those fuckers behind bars?

01:48:30.117 --> 01:48:31.117
You can't!

01:48:31.254 --> 01:48:32.712
Answer me!

- Stop it.

01:48:42.468 --> 01:48:43.634
Move aside.

01:48:47.608 --> 01:48:49.359
You're a law junkie too.

01:48:51.019 --> 01:48:53.353
You're no better than them.

01:48:58.288 --> 01:49:01.288
Alright, kill me if you want to.

01:49:02.727 --> 01:49:06.478
If it'll clear your grudge,
become a real killer.

01:49:07.196 --> 01:49:11.071
But the first one to go
isn't this bastard.

01:49:11.952 --> 01:49:13.743
I'm the worst one.

01:49:15.725 --> 01:49:16.850
What?

01:49:17.434 --> 01:49:22.142
I'm actually not... a Themis lawyer.

01:49:24.267 --> 01:49:26.184
I got greedy and got a big debt.

01:49:26.476 --> 01:49:28.016
My wife left me with my kid,

01:49:28.017 --> 01:49:29.809
so I took on your case.

01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:35.059
I wanted to use your case
to get a job and make money.

01:49:35.642 --> 01:49:38.059
So I'm the worst of all.

01:49:38.392 --> 01:49:39.476
Stab me.

01:49:39.725 --> 01:49:41.142
Kill me first.

01:49:42.809 --> 01:49:43.892
Go on.

01:49:46.975 --> 01:49:50.392
Can't do it? You know why?

01:49:53.683 --> 01:49:55.392
Cause you're not a killer.

01:49:57.559 --> 01:49:58.892
I know you.

01:49:59.642 --> 01:50:00.975
You...

01:50:02.142 --> 01:50:04.309
don't have what it takes to kill.

01:50:04.934 --> 01:50:06.392
I know this.

01:50:09.559 --> 01:50:11.226
That's why I'm sorry.

01:50:13.267 --> 01:50:14.809
I'm so sorry.

You are not a killer!

01:50:34.017 --> 01:50:36.184
We made you into one!

01:50:37.226 --> 01:50:38.934
That's why!

01:50:40.142 --> 01:50:41.892
That's why...

01:50:48.392 --> 01:50:51.351
we should be apologizing to you…

01:51:07.559 --> 01:51:10.184
I'm sorry…

Can we win?

01:52:05.017 --> 01:52:08.059
You said nothing's certain in court.

01:52:12.559 --> 01:52:14.226
But we'll never lose.

01:52:26.379 --> 01:52:28.087
I didn't convince her.

01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:31.243
You did.

01:52:36.392 --> 01:52:38.327
Look! He's here!

01:52:48.184 --> 01:52:50.892
Did you find any discrepancies
in Cho Hyun-woo's case?

01:52:52.017 --> 01:52:55.434
The truth will be revealed in court.

01:53:46.071 --> 01:53:48.429
The court is now in session.

01:53:55.972 --> 01:53:58.098

01:54:09.858 --> 01:54:11.774

01:54:30.613 --> 01:54:32.530
Your Honor.

01:54:34.045 --> 01:54:38.796
I am not here to defend Cho Hyun-woo.

01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:42.220
I'm here...

01:54:47.106 --> 01:54:51.606
to allow this court to formally apologize

01:54:53.118 --> 01:54:58.660
for causing grief to a boy 15 years ago.

01:55:01.097 --> 01:55:08.472
I hope that this new trial and its outcome

01:55:10.226 --> 01:55:15.017
will bring about a new start
to him and his family.

01:55:18.433 --> 01:55:22.891
Let's take a look
at the first piece of evidence.

01:55:24.775 --> 01:55:29.225
<i>The real Cho Hyun-woo was cleared
of all charges on Nov. 17, 2016</i>

01:55:29.226 --> 01:55:32.184
<i>It was 16 years after the incident.</i>

01:55:33.683 --> 01:55:39.641
<i>The detectives who framed Cho
were charged and incarcerated.</i>

01:55:39.642 --> 01:55:44.434
<i>Cho is now a family man,
and a father of 2 kids.</i>

01:55:46.184 --> 01:55:51.142
<i>Attorney Park Joon-young took
on other new trial cases</i>

01:55:52.226 --> 01:55:56.518
<i>and became known
as 'New Trial Specialist'.</i>
