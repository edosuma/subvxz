WEBVTT

00:02.304 --> 00:03.578
SPIDER-MAN: Seriously, MJ.

00:03.687 --> 00:05.672
I'm really sorry I haven't
had much time lately.

00:05.766 --> 00:07.578
It's... complicated.

00:07.624 --> 00:09.571
You're in a special
science-immersion school.

00:09.617 --> 00:11.039
Of course it's complicated.

00:11.086 --> 00:13.547
That's a huge opportunity
for you, Pete.

00:13.672 --> 00:16.094
But Midtown High hasn't been
the same since you left.

00:16.218 --> 00:19.126
Especially with what
happened to Harry.

00:19.383 --> 00:20.859
How's he holding up?

00:21.117 --> 00:22.327
Life-signs are stable,

00:22.373 --> 00:24.820
but... it's like he's
in complete hibernation.

00:24.950 --> 00:27.570
Whatever this infection is,
it's not letting him go.

00:27.648 --> 00:29.554
You should really
come visit Harry.

00:29.726 --> 00:30.648
And me.

00:30.758 --> 00:33.023
I will. First chance I get.

00:33.140 --> 00:34.734
It's been good
to hear your voice.

00:34.804 --> 00:36.328
You have no idea.

00:37.523 --> 00:40.476
Seeing Harry like that
can't be easy for Mary Jane.

00:40.586 --> 00:41.967
It's not easy for me,
and crazy stuff

00:42.013 --> 00:44.328
is pretty much standard
for my life.

00:44.804 --> 00:46.297
SPIDER-MAN: <i> MJ doesn't</i>
<i>know the half of it.</i>

00:46.396 --> 00:49.609
<i>The Anti-VenomSymbiote
that attacked Harry was Hydra's creation.</i>

00:49.672 --> 00:50.734
(ROARS)

00:50.804 --> 00:52.086
<i>And in the process</i>
<i>of stopping them,</i>

00:52.132 --> 00:54.539
<i>Agent Venom got knocked</i>
<i>out of commission.</i>

00:54.818 --> 00:57.687
<i>Add to that, Ock almost</i>
<i>destroyed the Triskelion,</i>

00:57.752 --> 01:00.984
<i>and Scarlet Spider sacrificed</i>
<i>himself to save New York.</i>

01:02.633 --> 01:04.789
All-in-all,
I've had better months.

01:04.875 --> 01:06.725
I could really
use some good news.

01:07.851 --> 01:09.500
FLASH: Yes!

01:09.922 --> 01:11.179
What's with all the "yessing"?

01:11.225 --> 01:12.726
We're back in business!

01:12.833 --> 01:15.414
(GROANS AND SIGHS)

01:15.530 --> 01:18.289
It seems the Symbiote
has fully recovered

01:18.372 --> 01:21.039
from your battle
with Anti-Venom, Flash.

01:21.179 --> 01:24.031
Your own body,
on the other hand... hasn't.

01:24.115 --> 01:26.187
There's more to me
than just me.

01:26.313 --> 01:28.726
If Venom's off
the disabled list, then...

01:28.772 --> 01:30.138
(GROANS)

01:30.184 --> 01:31.350
(GRUNTS)

01:32.148 --> 01:33.359
So am I!

01:33.456 --> 01:35.586
See, good as new!

01:35.665 --> 01:36.789
(GRUNTS)

01:39.648 --> 01:42.290
It's not like we built doors
on this place or anything.

01:42.336 --> 01:43.836
(SIGHS)
I'll get him.

01:47.801 --> 01:49.890
Oh, yeah!

01:49.976 --> 01:52.930
SPIDER-MAN: Uh, Venom... maybe
we should slow up. (GRUNTING)

01:52.976 --> 01:54.758
You know, baby steps?

01:57.398 --> 01:58.594
(GROANS)

01:58.719 --> 02:00.781
Baby steps are for babies.

02:00.914 --> 02:01.922
Uh-oh!

02:02.018 --> 02:03.172
(GROANS)

02:04.125 --> 02:05.555
Flash, you okay?

02:05.601 --> 02:06.675
(GROANS)

02:06.721 --> 02:09.320
I'm... awesome. (LAUGHS)

02:09.366 --> 02:11.945
Don't worry,
this is just a joyride.

02:12.008 --> 02:14.827
It's not like we're taking on
a super-villain or something.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.015
Look out!

02:16.110 --> 02:18.078
(BOTH GRUNTING)

02:19.812 --> 02:21.765
SPIDER-MAN:
"No super-villain," huh?

02:24.351 --> 02:26.256
You had to say that out loud.

02:38.623 --> 02:39.689
(GRUNTING)

02:40.776 --> 02:42.323
Whoa!

02:43.298 --> 02:44.526
Dr. Morbius?

02:44.635 --> 02:46.401
Ock's timid lab assistant?

02:46.455 --> 02:48.979
Wow! Someone's broke out
of their shell.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.705
The last time
we saw this guy,

02:52.776 --> 02:54.613
he was helping Ock create
the Anti-Venom

02:54.659 --> 02:55.916
that took out Flash.

02:56.025 --> 02:58.192
So we don't exactly have
the best history together.

02:58.254 --> 03:01.174
And it looks like he's gotten a few
Hydra-themed upgrades since then,

03:01.259 --> 03:03.166
judging by
the tentaskull motif.

03:04.791 --> 03:06.087
Whoa!

03:07.065 --> 03:08.284
Spidey!

03:08.401 --> 03:10.548
Venom, get outta here!
You're not ready!

03:10.596 --> 03:13.747
Whoa!
- Oh no, I ain't letting this clown

03:13.789 --> 03:15.731
escape after what he did to me!

03:16.364 --> 03:17.895
(GROANS)
Should have blocked that.

03:17.981 --> 03:19.723

Morb-ster!

03:25.152 --> 03:27.293
Where'd you get all
the fancy new toys?

03:27.715 --> 03:28.762
(GROANS)

03:28.834 --> 03:32.067
Didn't Hydra go off the grid
when we sank Hydra Island?

03:32.934 --> 03:34.106
(GROANING)

03:37.080 --> 03:39.987
Fool! With Hydra,
destroy one head...

Yeah, yeah. You guys,

03:42.181 --> 03:43.643

(CRUMBLING)
Uh-oh!

03:46.666 --> 03:48.916

should hold it together.

03:50.065 --> 03:53.276
(GROANING)

03:54.635 --> 03:57.260
Venom! Stop the roof
from collapsing!

03:57.380 --> 03:58.930
(GROANING)

03:58.976 --> 04:02.377
I can't do it.

04:42.685 --> 04:44.375
You were right, Spidey.

04:44.489 --> 04:47.411
People were in trouble,
and I couldn't do anything.

04:47.521 --> 04:50.083
It's like the Symbiote got scared.

04:50.849 --> 04:52.060
Or maybe I did.

04:52.271 --> 04:53.857
It's not your fault.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.708
(GRUNTS) It is.

04:56.279 --> 04:58.974
I put everyone in danger
by coming out here.

04:59.161 --> 05:00.200
(GRUNTS)

05:00.246 --> 05:02.755
Morbius was after the Venom
suit and got a piece of it.

05:02.825 --> 05:04.661
I can feel it missing.

05:04.771 --> 05:07.193
The Symbiote wants
to be all together.

05:07.279 --> 05:09.771
Come on, let's get
you back to HQ.

05:09.896 --> 05:11.310
I bet there's a game of...

05:11.435 --> 05:13.935
Sports on. Baseball?

05:14.145 --> 05:15.717
It's hockey season.

05:29.090 --> 05:31.676
Don't sound so surprised,
Dr. Octopus.

05:31.739 --> 05:33.403
Or so disappointed.

05:33.462 --> 05:37.270
After all, we cannot
trust you to leave the lab.

wishes in his absence,

05:56.292 --> 05:58.378
This is only the beginning,
I assure you.

05:58.451 --> 06:00.747
With the help of
my new lab assistant,

06:00.793 --> 06:03.161
I will create a weaponized
armor for Hydra,

06:03.207 --> 06:05.364
the likes of which
no one has ever seen.

06:05.453 --> 06:08.825
"Lab assistant,"
you pompous ingrate?

06:08.878 --> 06:11.768
I am one of the greatest
minds on the planet.

you waste that brainpower,</i>

06:14.996 --> 06:17.004
<i>obsessed with Spider-Man.</i>

06:17.067 --> 06:19.781
<i>Remember, Ock, since</i>
<i>Zola and Hydra Island</i>

06:19.827 --> 06:21.457
<i>sunk to the bottom</i>
<i>of the ocean,</i>

06:21.512 --> 06:23.473
<i>I'm in charge around here.</i>

06:23.520 --> 06:24.762
<i>Let's just say,</i>

06:24.817 --> 06:28.778
<i>you're lucky Morbius needs
you alive to finish his experiment.</i>

06:31.207 --> 06:33.293
You have the advantage now.

06:33.340 --> 06:36.981
But only I know Spider-Man's
greatest secret.

06:37.051 --> 06:39.895
Oh, it's only
a matter of time.

06:41.926 --> 06:44.614
VENOM: Maybe I just need
to put some practice time in,

06:44.685 --> 06:47.832
run a few scrimmages,
get back in game-shape.

06:48.090 --> 06:50.004
SPIDER-MAN: Yeah, that sounds like a good...
- Whoa!

06:50.098 --> 06:52.161
Plan? Uh, Flash?

06:52.207 --> 06:53.581
Scrimmages this way.
(VENOM GROANING)

06:53.629 --> 06:55.051
Hey! What?

06:55.106 --> 06:57.020
I can't control it!

06:57.090 --> 06:59.510
Come on, Symbiote,
what are you doing here!

06:59.556 --> 07:02.246
We're friends!
-Help!

07:02.292 --> 07:04.473
Oh, boy.
This can't be good.

07:10.184 --> 07:11.966
Do you have
the nutrient ready?

07:12.012 --> 07:14.825
I increased the lipid
concentration to stabilize

07:14.871 --> 07:18.418
the rate of enzymatic reaction
that you insisted upon.

07:18.475 --> 07:20.168
Excellent. See?

07:20.214 --> 07:22.239
I knew you would prove
yourself useful.

07:22.293 --> 07:24.028
Of all your previous work,

07:24.075 --> 07:25.887
this will be the
greatest achievement

07:25.933 --> 07:28.200
you will ever
be associated with.

07:28.951 --> 07:30.652
(SCOFFS)

07:32.114 --> 07:34.645
Oh, we'll see about that.

07:46.268 --> 07:47.836
(ENERGY PULSES)

07:52.340 --> 07:54.567

07:54.684 --> 07:56.300

(GROANING)

07:56.346 --> 07:58.208
Even more nuts
than Squirrel Girl! (GROANING)

07:58.254 --> 07:59.570
(GROANING)
I got an idea.

07:59.616 --> 08:00.926
Let's turn around
and go home!

08:00.972 --> 08:02.184
I can't!

08:02.246 --> 08:05.081
It's calling us.
It's a part of us.

08:05.127 --> 08:08.200
What are you talking about?
Wait... Morbius.

08:08.246 --> 08:10.771
You can sense the sample
of the Symbiote he stole from you.

08:10.848 --> 08:12.951
Which means...
Flash!

08:13.063 --> 08:15.091
The Symbiote's
leading us to Hydra.

08:15.154 --> 08:16.709
You're not ready for this.

08:18.146 --> 08:20.451
I'm not in control.

08:20.497 --> 08:23.368
I told you that, like,
three times already.

08:23.414 --> 08:25.422
Okay, then I got an idea.

08:25.915 --> 08:26.926
(GRUNTS)

08:28.043 --> 08:29.300
(YELLS)
Really?

08:29.346 --> 08:30.812
Sorry!

08:31.664 --> 08:33.298
It's glorious.

08:33.344 --> 08:36.633
The otherSymbiotes,
Venom, Anti-Venom,

08:36.679 --> 08:39.063
all stepping stones to this.

08:39.148 --> 08:42.782
You are witnessing the birth
of the perfect weapon.

08:42.860 --> 08:44.524
We shall see.

08:44.619 --> 08:47.774
Well, one of us will anyway.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.961
I'm afraid now that
we're successful,

08:50.047 --> 08:52.022
your role in this
little production

08:52.068 --> 08:53.635
is finally at an end.

08:54.094 --> 08:55.470
(BEEPS)

08:56.641 --> 08:58.266
Huh?

08:58.367 --> 09:00.211
What do you think
you're doing?

09:00.313 --> 09:02.399
I'm finished
with the Octopus.

09:02.485 --> 09:03.610
See to him, will you?

09:06.500 --> 09:08.078
SPIDER-MAN: Flash,
it's not too late!

09:08.124 --> 09:09.368
You have to regain control.

09:09.414 --> 09:10.899
(SCREAMING)

09:10.945 --> 09:12.477
You've done this before!

09:13.844 --> 09:16.461
Maybe if I calm my mind...

09:16.602 --> 09:19.563
Ohmmmm...

09:20.336 --> 09:22.330
Whoa. (GRUNTS)

We can come back.

possibly be good.

Oh, man.
