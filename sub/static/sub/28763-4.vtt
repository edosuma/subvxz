01:58.119 --> 01:59.120
I pushed him.

02:02.832 --> 02:07.170
You didn't push him.
And you didn't push him. Nobody did.

02:25.438 --> 02:27.148
Ew.

02:27.232 --> 02:28.858
It even scared me, Josh.

02:28.942 --> 02:31.402
- It's gross!
- Aren't they supposed to be scary?

02:31.486 --> 02:32.779
It's the whole point.

02:32.862 --> 02:35.240
- They're supposed to be monsters.
- Mine's done.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.158
- It got stabbed.
- That's disgusting.

02:37.242 --> 02:39.077
No, you can't leave it like that.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.914
Some gang member could steal it
and use it to stab a person in the heart.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.625
Chloe, there are no gangs in Monterey.

02:45.708 --> 02:46.584
I have this.

02:46.668 --> 02:49.420
Come on,
draw a face or something.

02:49.504 --> 02:52.215
It's gonna be total disco themed.
It's gonna be amazing.

02:52.298 --> 02:54.884
It's gonna blow <i>Frozen</i> out of the water.
What are you doing?

02:54.968 --> 02:57.887
- I'm smoking. I hate smoking.
- Nobody smokes anymore.

02:57.971 --> 02:59.681
I'm just trying to manage my stress.

02:59.764 --> 03:02.684
We're talking about Amabella's
birthday party. It'll be amazing.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.060
How you doing?

03:04.143 --> 03:06.271
How's everything with Ed? Is he here?

03:06.354 --> 03:10.316
Um... Whether or not we're still married,
it's undetermined.

03:11.192 --> 03:13.945
- Oh. Babe.
- Sorry.

03:14.028 --> 03:15.989
I don't know. It's not just Ed.

03:16.072 --> 03:19.158
I just feel like
everything right now is so fucked.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.285
Yeah, it's a lot.

03:21.327 --> 03:23.371
Everything's weird.

03:23.454 --> 03:25.456
- What time is her party?
- Two,

03:25.540 --> 03:29.002
because I have to go
to bankruptcy court that morning.

03:29.085 --> 03:30.420
- What?
- On a Saturday?

03:30.503 --> 03:32.213
Well, we worked it out.

03:32.297 --> 03:36.426
It's better that we don't have to sit
around those penniless losers,

03:36.509 --> 03:37.594
as though that's not us.

03:37.677 --> 03:39.679
Jesus, I don't know
how you're still with him.

03:39.762 --> 03:41.723
I know he's your husband, but...

03:41.806 --> 03:43.349
- Fuck.
- I don't know.

03:43.433 --> 03:44.433
We stay.

03:44.475 --> 03:46.019
You don't have to.

03:46.102 --> 03:47.896
But we do.

03:47.979 --> 03:51.441
They betray us and we stay, you know.

03:51.524 --> 03:56.362
They lie, they cheat on us, and we s...

03:56.446 --> 03:59.574
- You know you said that out loud?
- I did. I said it out loud. Shit.

03:59.657 --> 04:02.327
I just... We stay.
We work it out, is my point.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.620
I'm coming!

04:03.703 --> 04:05.955
Tell me to stop talking, please.

04:06.039 --> 04:07.332
Just all the time.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.418
- Oh, hi.
- Mary Louise?

04:11.669 --> 04:14.547
The boys told me
you were having a pumpkin-carving party.

04:14.631 --> 04:16.382
It sounded like so much fun.

04:17.675 --> 04:19.260
And I... I can, um...

04:20.261 --> 04:22.680
I can be gone in a flash
if it's an imposition.

04:22.764 --> 04:24.682
Oh, no, no, no. Please come in.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.852
- I brought a...
- Kids!

04:29.103 --> 04:30.313
Surprise.

04:31.356 --> 04:33.107
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

04:33.191 --> 04:35.485
Oh,
there's my little soldiers.

04:35.568 --> 04:39.489
Aw. I see two handsome grandsons.

04:39.572 --> 04:41.991
Somehow, I thought for sure
there'd be three.

04:42.075 --> 04:43.326
Where did I get that idea?

04:43.409 --> 04:45.828
- Oh, Ziggy. He's right there.
- Ziggy's over there.

04:45.912 --> 04:47.497
There he is.

04:49.707 --> 04:52.877
That's an intriguing jack-o'-lantern.

04:52.961 --> 04:53.961
He's shocked.

04:55.672 --> 04:57.465
I think we're all a little shocked.

04:57.548 --> 04:59.258
Have you met Bonnie, Mary Louise?

04:59.342 --> 05:00.342
Hi.

05:01.511 --> 05:02.511
Uh...

05:03.262 --> 05:04.806
I don't believe I have.

05:04.889 --> 05:06.766
I would certainly remember.

05:06.849 --> 05:09.560
So beautiful.

05:09.644 --> 05:10.812
Jane, hi.

05:10.895 --> 05:12.522
Guess what?

05:12.605 --> 05:14.691
I got a unit in your building.

05:14.774 --> 05:18.027
- My building?
- Yes, it's perfect.

05:18.111 --> 05:20.279
I'm just getting settled, so...

05:20.363 --> 05:23.783
I can take the boys sometimes
for some stayover nights.

05:23.866 --> 05:24.742
Yeah!

05:24.826 --> 05:28.830
Yeah, you know,
so you can have some time to have a life.

05:28.913 --> 05:31.416
- Can I come too?
- Of course, all my grandchildren.

05:34.419 --> 05:37.171
Mary Louise. Mary Louise,
can I have a word with you, please?

05:37.255 --> 05:38.923
Yeah, sure. Of course.

05:39.549 --> 05:42.593
I'm cleaning my pumpkin.
If you tap on it, all...

05:44.971 --> 05:47.598
You really think that this is a good idea?

05:47.682 --> 05:49.350
- What?
- Moving into Jane's building?

05:49.434 --> 05:51.644
- Why wouldn't it be?
- Because there are boundaries,

05:51.728 --> 05:52.937
Mary Louise.

05:53.021 --> 05:55.273
Where would you have me go? Canada?

05:55.356 --> 05:57.567
This is all beginning to feel
a little perverse.

05:57.650 --> 06:00.403
- I beg your pardon?
- Moving in with your son's rape victim.

06:00.486 --> 06:03.364
- For God's sake, it's not right.
- I'm not moving in with her.

06:03.448 --> 06:05.158
We're in the same building complex.

06:05.241 --> 06:08.786
- No. This...
- And by the way, I'm not as convinced

06:08.870 --> 06:11.622
as you are, perhaps,
that she was a rape victim.

06:11.706 --> 06:13.541
Oh, my God. I can't...

06:13.624 --> 06:16.210
You know, there are many, many questions
that I still have.

06:16.294 --> 06:19.047
For instance,
why was he even with her that night?

06:19.130 --> 06:21.007
What was he looking for?

06:21.090 --> 06:23.760
Perhaps seeking refuge from?

06:23.843 --> 06:25.136
What's that supposed to mean?

06:25.219 --> 06:27.472
How many other women did he go to?

06:27.555 --> 06:28.973
If there's one...

06:30.183 --> 06:31.726
there are others.

06:33.269 --> 06:35.146
Oh, my God.

06:35.229 --> 06:36.606
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

06:36.689 --> 06:38.983
- No, no, no.
- I shouldn't have done that. I...

06:39.067 --> 06:40.318
What shall we call that?

06:42.153 --> 06:43.196
Foreplay?

06:44.363 --> 06:45.364
Grandma.

06:45.448 --> 06:46.949
Oh, dear.

07:01.964 --> 07:05.093
- What's all this?
- Pumpkin-carving project.

07:05.176 --> 07:07.512
The school decided
to celebrate Halloween this week.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.639
God forbid they wait
till the end of the month.

07:09.722 --> 07:13.518
I swear everyone in this town is obsessed
with first and better and most.

07:13.601 --> 07:16.437
Speaking of which, it's Amabella's
birthday disco party tomorrow.

07:16.521 --> 07:18.397
It's not even her fucking birthday.

07:18.481 --> 07:21.317
I mean, is it too much to ask people
to check people's calendars

07:21.400 --> 07:23.111
and then get back to them accordingly?

07:23.194 --> 07:25.738
We all have calendar apps
on our phone, for God's sake.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.242
What? Why are you staring at me?

07:29.325 --> 07:30.325
Um...

07:33.287 --> 07:36.207
There's never any middle ground with you.

07:36.290 --> 07:40.711
Like, when you're upset, it's charge.
Full speed ahead.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.507
If there's a problem, charge.

07:47.844 --> 07:51.264
If there was a problem with us,
where was the charge?

07:52.390 --> 07:55.685
Why couldn't you come straight at me
like you go at everyone else?

07:57.145 --> 08:01.566
There wasn't a problem with us, Ed.
There's a problem with me.

08:29.844 --> 08:31.179
Okay.

08:31.262 --> 08:34.097
Oh, and it is a disco party, so...

08:34.182 --> 08:37.143
And costumes may
or may not be required.

08:37.226 --> 08:40.270
So the opportunity
for embarrassment is huge?

08:40.354 --> 08:42.899
- Yeah.
- Ready?

08:42.982 --> 08:44.192
Okay. Come on.

08:47.403 --> 08:48.821
Got you.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.535
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:05.922 --> 09:08.299
- Do you wanna start or should I?
- Yeah, I'll start.

09:10.885 --> 09:12.553
I'm worried about the boys.

09:14.347 --> 09:17.058
- Because?
- Because. Because...

09:19.310 --> 09:21.020
you seem unwell.

09:22.438 --> 09:23.438
Erratic.

09:24.440 --> 09:25.440
I'm fine.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.194
You hit me.

09:28.277 --> 09:31.113
And I apologized for that.

09:31.197 --> 09:32.823
I've...

09:32.907 --> 09:33.991
You snapped.

09:41.916 --> 09:43.876
It's meant to be shared, you know.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.711
Grief.

09:45.795 --> 09:47.004
It's...

09:51.092 --> 09:52.635
insurmountable.

09:54.637 --> 09:57.390
Too difficult a battle to be waged alone.

10:00.935 --> 10:02.436
Which is what you had to do.

10:03.562 --> 10:06.065
You were alone after the accident.

10:06.148 --> 10:07.483
Your husband left.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.529
Perry told me.

10:11.612 --> 10:14.532
Yes, he blamed me.

10:15.950 --> 10:16.950
And he left.

10:18.077 --> 10:20.204
And I deserved the blame.

10:20.288 --> 10:21.998
To be left.

10:22.081 --> 10:23.291
You know, Ray...

10:25.084 --> 10:26.127
made a new life.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.546
He got a new family.

10:28.629 --> 10:31.465
He became a devoted father, so I'm told.

10:31.549 --> 10:33.342
It's... It's good.

10:33.426 --> 10:36.429
People can move on after tragedy,

10:36.512 --> 10:38.597
just not together sometimes.

10:44.562 --> 10:48.774
What do you think
about going to Big Sur?

10:48.858 --> 10:50.192
Just the two of us.

10:51.610 --> 10:55.031
There's a couples' thing.

10:55.114 --> 10:57.992
It's a... It's a workshop.
A couples' workshop.

10:58.075 --> 11:01.704
I know, I know, that sounds awful,
but it's gotta be better than that lady,

11:01.787 --> 11:04.123
and it's supposed to be amazing.

11:07.418 --> 11:10.212
"Madeline, I would love
to go with you into the woods

11:10.296 --> 11:12.465
and talk about my feelings
and make love to you."

11:14.342 --> 11:15.342
No?

11:16.969 --> 11:19.138
Mom, can you look over my project?

11:19.221 --> 11:20.514
Yeah.

11:20.598 --> 11:21.974
This is opposites.

11:22.058 --> 11:23.976
And next, we're gonna do synonyms.

11:24.060 --> 11:25.478
Okay. Opposites.

11:25.561 --> 11:26.812
- That's a door.
- Yeah.

11:26.896 --> 11:28.397
- And that is...
- That's you.

11:28.481 --> 11:29.690
Me. Of course.

11:29.774 --> 11:31.150
Uh...

11:31.233 --> 11:32.818
I don't... I don't understand.

11:33.944 --> 11:35.196
The door's hinged.

11:37.782 --> 11:40.534
I see. Is that supposed to be funny?

11:40.618 --> 11:42.536
Well, my teacher wants imagery.

11:42.620 --> 11:44.955
Not words like "hot" and "cold."

11:45.039 --> 11:46.039
Uh-huh.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.126
I'll change it.

11:50.419 --> 11:51.420
Ah.

11:51.921 --> 11:55.591
So is this the party line around here?
That I'm unhinged?

11:55.674 --> 11:58.094
- That's the book on me?
- Pretty much.

12:00.513 --> 12:01.513
Great.

12:05.601 --> 12:08.062
I don't understand
why the attorney can't handle this.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.188
Because they can't.

12:09.271 --> 12:12.650
All right? He had to pluck a zillion strings
to get this through on a Saturday

12:12.733 --> 12:13.818
with nobody else around.

12:18.781 --> 12:22.493
It's not like a scarlet letter.
People file for bankruptcy all the time.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.120
Some even go on to become president.

12:24.203 --> 12:27.123
Let's just keep this thing moving along.
I've got a party to throw.

12:27.206 --> 12:32.378
Absolutely no mention of that whatsoever
to the trustee. All right? Am I clear?

12:33.712 --> 12:36.090
So this represents your
assets in their entirety?

12:36.173 --> 12:38.050
- Yes, sir.
- Condo in Aspen.

12:38.134 --> 12:41.262
Four-bedroom vacation home
in Palm Beach,

12:41.345 --> 12:44.306
including a 58-foot Red Sea Yacht.

12:44.390 --> 12:45.391
The <i>Amabella.</i>

12:45.474 --> 12:47.518
Any other recreational
or vacation home?

12:47.601 --> 12:49.103
No, sir.

12:49.186 --> 12:51.856
Estimated liability is $33 million?

12:51.939 --> 12:54.066
Yes, but most of that
is pending civil lawsuits,

12:54.150 --> 12:56.444
and we expect to be able to settle
within that range.

12:56.527 --> 13:00.364
You really don't get to settle anything
anymore, Mr. Klein. That all falls on me.

13:01.740 --> 13:04.201
Your residence has been listed for sale?

13:04.285 --> 13:07.580
- Uh, yes. We expect it to go for north of 20.
- At least.

13:07.663 --> 13:09.874
Again, my decision, not yours.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.959
Any other legal actions pending?

13:12.042 --> 13:13.252
Uh, right to sue?

13:13.335 --> 13:16.464
- Any punitive judgments in your favor?
- No, sir.

13:16.547 --> 13:19.049
Any expectation of inheritance
in the next 18 months?

13:19.133 --> 13:20.133
No, sir.

13:21.177 --> 13:22.219
Parents in good health?

13:24.805 --> 13:26.223
- Are you serious?
- Uh...

13:26.307 --> 13:28.058
Yes, they're in good health.

13:33.481 --> 13:35.232
Do you stand to inherit?

13:36.609 --> 13:37.985
I'm self-made.

13:46.452 --> 13:50.873
I see a charge for $4200
to Morris-Simmons Lab.

13:54.543 --> 13:56.754
Can anybody tell me what that's for?

13:56.837 --> 13:57.838
Medical.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.842
- Did you submit to insurance?
- No.

14:01.926 --> 14:02.926
Why not?

14:03.886 --> 14:05.930
Because it's...

14:06.013 --> 14:08.933
It wouldn't be declared as insurance.

14:09.975 --> 14:11.018
Well, what is it?

14:12.144 --> 14:13.187
It's medical.

14:14.563 --> 14:16.357
Like I said the first time.

14:16.440 --> 14:19.151
I don't think you follow here, Mrs. Klein.

14:19.818 --> 14:23.322
See, this is a bankruptcy hearing.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.282
And I can deny your petition.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.119
Renata...

14:35.626 --> 14:38.671
From dealing with men like you
all my life. Okay?

14:42.299 --> 14:43.299
Mm-hm.

14:45.970 --> 14:47.638
Going forward, disallow.

14:49.181 --> 14:51.058
I have here a listing of your jewelry,

14:51.141 --> 14:53.477
which doesn't include
that Rolex watch you're wearing.

14:53.561 --> 14:54.853
I'll take it.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.231
- You mean mine?
- Are you kidding?

14:57.314 --> 15:00.150
- John, come on.
- It doesn't include that either.

15:00.234 --> 15:03.237
- That's my wedding ring.
- It's not listed.

15:07.366 --> 15:08.366
I'm... I'm not...

15:09.785 --> 15:12.413
- giving my...
- I will handle this later.

15:26.302 --> 15:27.595
We done here?

15:28.554 --> 15:31.849
- How did you get here today?
- We drove.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.267
Personal car?

15:34.476 --> 15:35.894
Tesla, 2017.

15:36.645 --> 15:39.565
- At least we got your ring back.
- Shut up.

15:41.859 --> 15:45.321
There will come a day
that you will pay for this, Gordon.

15:47.114 --> 15:50.367
But today is not that day.

15:50.451 --> 15:53.829
Today is Amabella's day,

15:53.912 --> 15:58.250
and it will be filled with laughter

15:58.334 --> 16:00.586
and magic

16:00.669 --> 16:04.423
and pure, unmitigated joy.

16:17.853 --> 16:20.648
- Hi!
- Welcome to Club Amabella!

16:21.690 --> 16:24.234
- You look incredible. You look...
- Oh, thank you.

16:24.318 --> 16:27.571
- This is my mom, Elizabeth. This is Renata.
- Elizabeth! Renata.

16:27.655 --> 16:29.698
- We have never met.
- No, we have not.

16:29.782 --> 16:32.451
It's such a pleasure,
and thank you so much for inviting me.

16:32.534 --> 16:34.078
Of course.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.954
I mean, The Trammps?

16:36.038 --> 16:37.623
And they're headlining.

16:37.706 --> 16:40.668
- So amazing.
- Come in. Get champagne.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.836
Hi.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.880
Have a wonderful time.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.049
Ziggy Stardust, ladies and gentlemen.

16:47.132 --> 16:50.344
- This is Corey Brockfield.
- I've heard so much about you.

16:50.427 --> 16:53.847
It's so great to meet you, Corey.
Welcome to my home.

16:53.931 --> 16:55.974
- No, hi. Bonnie.
- Hi.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.811
- Nice to meet you.
- Gordon. Get him some champagne.

16:58.894 --> 17:00.854
I can't. He's so cute,
I can't even take it.

17:00.938 --> 17:03.065
- I can't. I can't. I can't.
- Just don't tell him.

17:03.148 --> 17:04.400
- Get on that.
- He's so cute.

17:04.483 --> 17:06.026
You guys have to be cool.

17:06.109 --> 17:08.612
- I made the biggest mistake bringing him.
- I'm never cool.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.321
But I will try my best. For you.

17:10.406 --> 17:13.409
For you, I'm about to be cool
for the first time in my life.

17:15.661 --> 17:21.083
Are we gonna dance again? That's right.
We always need a dance party, don't we?

17:21.165 --> 17:22.792
Hi, how are you?

17:25.212 --> 17:30.551
Uh, this is a list of all
of the best family law attorneys

17:30.634 --> 17:32.511
in the Bay Area,

17:32.594 --> 17:34.346
as well as the peninsula.

17:34.430 --> 17:37.850
I would like you to call each one of them.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.436
But I have you. Wha...?

17:40.519 --> 17:42.646
Why do I need to call them?

17:42.730 --> 17:46.608
Well, you won't,
but your daughter-in-law will,

17:46.692 --> 17:52.030
and if you call them first,
you know, she can't have them.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.741
They'll be conflicted out.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.412
It's... You know, it's an ugly process.

18:00.998 --> 18:03.167
Are you really sure
you wanna proceed with this?

18:06.295 --> 18:08.088
He agreed to go to a sauna center.

18:08.172 --> 18:11.091
It's like a healing institute
for mature couples.

18:11.175 --> 18:13.552
- Yeah, right.
- Maybe it used to be a...

18:13.635 --> 18:17.139
Celeste, what exactly
does your mother-in-law know?

18:17.222 --> 18:19.933
She gave me a very strange look yesterday.

18:20.017 --> 18:22.519
If anything, she's suspicious of me.

18:22.603 --> 18:24.521
Does that bother you, all that suspicion?

18:24.605 --> 18:26.440
It does bother me. It does.

18:26.523 --> 18:29.860
And if I could do it again, I wouldn't lie.
I wouldn't go along with the lie.

18:29.943 --> 18:30.861
Exactly.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.906
Hold on a second.
What are you trying to say?

18:33.989 --> 18:37.618
You were the one that said
that he slipped, that he fell, and...

18:37.701 --> 18:39.703
I mean, we went along with it.

18:39.787 --> 18:42.790
- Are you blaming me?
- I blame myself, all right?

18:42.873 --> 18:46.251
It seemed like a good idea at the time,
but I was numb.

18:46.335 --> 18:48.796
I wasn't thinking straight,
and let's face it,

18:48.879 --> 18:52.257
this fucking lie has
had quite a shelf life.

18:52.341 --> 18:54.051
- Yeah, I agree.
- Wow.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.844
You're talking about me
behind my back?

18:55.928 --> 18:57.513
- You're blaming me.
- No. No.

18:57.596 --> 19:01.099
- No, that's rich. That's really rich.
- We're not blaming you behind your back.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.811
We're right here. It's to your face.

But, I mean, do you think
there's any chance

19:43.016 --> 19:46.311
that you'll be able
to forgive me eventually?

19:47.938 --> 19:49.398
It's not about you, Gordon.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.650
It's not?

19:51.733 --> 19:54.653
Since I was old enough to dream
of having my own family,

19:54.736 --> 19:57.990
I've been, in my head,
planning my child's life.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.951
What it would entail,
what she would have,

20:02.369 --> 20:04.538
the opportunities I could give her.

20:05.581 --> 20:08.750
So I'm having a difficult time reconciling

20:08.834 --> 20:10.878
that all my dreams have gone to shit.

20:12.004 --> 20:15.257
All my hopes and plans for Amabella
have gone to shit.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.886
I married a man...

20:20.804 --> 20:25.684
who would take my life
and all my accomplishments

20:25.767 --> 20:27.519
and just turn them to shit.

20:29.104 --> 20:31.398
That... That's on me. Right?

20:31.481 --> 20:33.358

I don't like the energy in this house.

21:39.007 --> 21:41.301
I mean, not the party. This is great.

21:43.387 --> 21:44.513
Something deeper.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.016
And I don't like the energy around you.

21:48.100 --> 21:50.477
This is just your weird imagination.

22:47.034 --> 22:49.453
But maybe sometime when we're not

22:49.536 --> 22:52.164
doing a dog and pony show
in front of all of Monterey.

22:53.498 --> 22:56.251
- I'm sick of all the pretending.
- What do you mean, pretending?

22:56.334 --> 22:58.378
What do I mean, pretending?
Are you kidding me?

22:58.462 --> 22:59.880
Are you looking at this room?

24:09.991 --> 24:14.913

to make sure there are no inaccuracies.

24:14.996 --> 24:17.415

- Yeah.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.376

you can count on being, uh, alienated
from the boys.

you might get custody, but affection...

24:27.217 --> 24:29.302

24:29.386 --> 24:31.930
Okay, everyone needs to be liked.

24:32.013 --> 24:34.558

26:32.884 --> 26:33.885
Really?

26:33.969 --> 26:35.011
Yeah.

26:54.197 --> 26:56.408
Amabella's so happy you came.

26:56.491 --> 26:58.034
- Thank you.
- Good to see you.

26:58.118 --> 26:59.995
- Even better than <i>Frozen.</i>
- Do you promise?

27:00.078 --> 27:02.414
- Oh, my gosh. Amazing.
- You better not be lying to me.

27:02.497 --> 27:04.916
I'm not lying, I also wanna borrow
your dress. Is that weird?

27:05.000 --> 27:07.085
Uh, no. You own it.

27:07.168 --> 27:09.504
- Oh, my God.
- That was insane.

27:09.587 --> 27:11.381
- Disco was genius.
- Really?

27:11.464 --> 27:13.675
- Yeah, it was great.
- It was. It was so great.

27:13.758 --> 27:16.761
- Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.
- For you. We've got one for you.

27:16.845 --> 27:18.888
I know someone had a great time.

27:18.972 --> 27:20.307
- I had a ball.
- That... Oh, no.

27:20.390 --> 27:23.018
You on that dance floor.

27:23.101 --> 27:24.477
It was amazing.

27:24.561 --> 27:25.562
It was a ball.

27:27.647 --> 27:30.734
- All right. Thank you.
- I'm so happy you were here.

27:32.736 --> 27:34.154
Mama.

27:34.237 --> 27:35.739
You okay?

27:35.822 --> 27:37.699
- Mom?
- Elizabeth?

27:37.782 --> 27:39.534
- What's wrong with her?
- Elizabeth?

27:39.617 --> 27:40.618
Oh, my God. Mom.

27:40.702 --> 27:44.372
- Oh, my God. Mom! Mom! Mom!
- Watch her head. Watch her head.

27:44.456 --> 27:47.667
- Oh, my God! Somebody call 911!
- What is happening to her?

27:58.887 --> 28:00.555
So, what happened?

28:00.638 --> 28:04.434
She had a stroke,
which most likely caused the seizure.

28:04.517 --> 28:08.396
We're gonna take her into surgery now
and clean out a carotid artery in her neck.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.358
It's good that you got her here so quickly.

28:11.441 --> 28:13.318
As soon as we know more,
I'll let you know.

28:13.401 --> 28:15.528
She just dropped like a stone.

28:27.207 --> 28:29.709
I seriously thought she was gonna die.

28:32.128 --> 28:34.672
It really makes you take stock of things.

28:40.553 --> 28:41.596
You okay?

28:43.014 --> 28:44.014
No.

28:44.974 --> 28:46.684
I'm far from okay.

28:47.727 --> 28:49.938
Look, if you're gonna leave me,
can you just do it?

28:50.021 --> 28:51.439
Can you just get it over with?

28:52.774 --> 28:55.110
Wh... I mean, I'm still here, aren't I?

28:55.193 --> 28:56.861
Is that what you think, Ed?

28:57.904 --> 28:59.197
You're far from here.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.117
You're not even fucking close.

29:14.421 --> 29:18.758
I had a really weird thing happened earlier
when I was dancing with Corey. Um...

29:19.050 --> 29:22.554
Everything was going fine, it was great,
and then he moved his hand,

29:22.637 --> 29:28.601
and my mind froze, and my body recoiled
and kind of had this spasm.

29:30.019 --> 29:32.355
It's really frustrating
because I'm doing so well,

29:32.439 --> 29:34.816
and then something like that happens.

29:34.899 --> 29:37.735
And it's like,
am I ever gonna be able to be sexual again?

29:37.819 --> 29:39.237
Can you relate to that?

29:40.321 --> 29:41.322
Did he ever...

29:43.241 --> 29:45.785
Did Perry ever rape you?

29:45.869 --> 29:47.078
How we doing?

29:47.162 --> 29:48.788
Another round?

29:48.872 --> 29:51.166
No, I'm good. Thank you, actually.

29:52.876 --> 29:53.877
It'll happen.

29:55.003 --> 29:56.963
- So he didn't?
- No.

29:58.673 --> 29:59.757
No, he didn't.

30:04.095 --> 30:07.140
I'm gonna swing by the hospital on my way
and just check up on Bonnie.

30:07.223 --> 30:11.895
Would you tell her that my boys
are with Mary Louise tonight, so if she...

30:11.978 --> 30:13.855
If she wants anything, I'm here.

30:14.939 --> 30:16.232
Ugh. Okay.

30:18.109 --> 30:19.277
- Bye.
- Love you.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.360
Love you.

30:23.490 --> 30:25.366
So, what's it gonna be?

30:25.450 --> 30:28.453
- Oh, what the hell, I'll have another one.
- Good choice.

30:40.548 --> 30:42.550
Looking for Elizabeth Howard.

30:43.510 --> 30:45.345
- She's right through there.
- Dad.

30:50.391 --> 30:52.185
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:54.229 --> 30:57.106
- She okay?
- I think.

30:58.399 --> 30:59.817
What'd the surgeon say?

30:59.901 --> 31:03.613
Her brain scans showed some bleeding,
but, um, it's minimal,

31:03.696 --> 31:06.658
so we won't know anything else
till she wakes up.

31:12.664 --> 31:14.499
Did you say something to her?

31:14.582 --> 31:16.668
Before the incident,
did you say something?

31:16.751 --> 31:18.878
- You mean, did I cause this?
- I didn't mean that.

31:18.962 --> 31:20.129
Yeah, you did.

31:20.213 --> 31:24.342
It's just that you know
how easily upset she gets.

31:24.425 --> 31:25.802
I didn't cause her fucking stroke.

31:25.885 --> 31:28.346
Calm down.
What if she can hear you?

31:31.099 --> 31:32.099
Okay.

31:33.142 --> 31:36.104
I'm gonna let you sit with her for a while.
Okay?

31:46.322 --> 31:47.824
I'm here, baby.

31:47.907 --> 31:52.996
It's the best pizza in the world!

31:53.079 --> 31:55.623
That's what your dad used to say.

31:55.707 --> 31:59.043
When he was your age.
You know that?

31:59.127 --> 32:01.379
- He said that with us too.
- He did?

32:01.462 --> 32:03.631
Did he teach you
how to stretch the cheese?

32:03.715 --> 32:06.968
- Yeah.
- Stretch the cheese.

32:07.051 --> 32:08.219
Mm-hm.

32:09.637 --> 32:12.181
Nothing better in the world.

32:12.265 --> 32:15.602
If Dad was here,
he would eat a whole pizza to himself.

32:18.730 --> 32:21.524
He is. He is here, in a way.

32:22.900 --> 32:25.528
You know, people are never really gone.

32:27.280 --> 32:31.284
Because they live on in the hearts
of those they leave behind.

32:31.367 --> 32:35.246
We just have to keep your dad here.

32:36.664 --> 32:37.790
In your hearts.

32:37.874 --> 32:38.874
Right?

32:39.792 --> 32:40.792
Right?

32:42.128 --> 32:44.255
It's the best pizza in the world.

33:59.122 --> 34:01.624
- Seriously?
- Excuse me?

34:01.708 --> 34:04.419
- What the fuck?
- Bonnie. Hey.

34:06.462 --> 34:07.462
Sorry.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.007
She chooses now?

34:10.091 --> 34:12.467
No, no, she's here for some DUI fatality
or something.

34:12.552 --> 34:16.013
I ran into her downstairs.
It's something else.

34:16.097 --> 34:19.475
- She's just a daughter of a patient.
- I know who she is.

34:23.396 --> 34:27.775
I so wanted to bring the boys to church,
but Max was adamantly opposed.

34:27.859 --> 34:30.777
He thinks that God is a douchebag.

34:30.862 --> 34:32.530
His language, not mine.

34:32.612 --> 34:33.989
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi, Mommy.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.241
- Hi.
- You all right?

34:35.324 --> 34:37.326
Yeah, I'm fine.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.871
- Just didn't sleep very well, you know?
- Yeah.

34:39.954 --> 34:41.414
We had pulled pizza.

34:41.496 --> 34:42.496
- Did you?
- Yeah.

34:42.540 --> 34:44.792
Yeah. We stretched the cheese
like Daddy used to do.

34:44.876 --> 34:47.670
Well, that sounds really fun.

34:47.754 --> 34:50.590
And we saw Ziggy this morning.
He lives in Grandma's building.

34:51.799 --> 34:53.134
Mm.

34:53.217 --> 34:55.303
- Great.
- What's the matter?

34:55.386 --> 34:56.763
Celeste, what's wrong?

34:56.846 --> 35:00.975
I just... I don't know,
I feel like I'm coming down with something.

35:01.058 --> 35:04.061
- Hmm?
- I just feel like very zonked.

35:04.145 --> 35:05.563
You look funny.

35:05.646 --> 35:06.898
Mm.

35:06.981 --> 35:08.149
No fever.

35:11.152 --> 35:12.612
What a mess.

35:14.113 --> 35:15.740
- Good Lord.
- Hey.

35:18.034 --> 35:19.118
How we all doing?

35:21.078 --> 35:22.078
I gotta...

35:23.539 --> 35:24.665
Hey, buddy.

35:26.793 --> 35:29.170
And who do we have with us today?

35:29.253 --> 35:30.379
I'm... I'm Joe.

35:30.463 --> 35:31.672
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:31.756 --> 35:32.756
Sorry.

35:35.676 --> 35:36.761
So...

35:39.847 --> 35:41.891
Shall we...

35:41.974 --> 35:44.477
Let's get clean, shall we?

36:04.956 --> 36:07.416
Wait, did you take Ambien again?

36:07.500 --> 36:09.627
And you didn't even remember
he was in the house?

36:09.710 --> 36:14.215
I couldn't... I didn't even realize where
I was when they came running in, I just...

36:14.298 --> 36:16.801
Look, you're entitled
to have a private life.

36:16.884 --> 36:19.595
She said she was taking the boys
for a sleepover.

36:19.679 --> 36:21.931
I know, she comes in at a...
It must have been like...

36:22.014 --> 36:24.308
Yeah, she should have called you first
or texted you.

36:24.392 --> 36:26.143
You can't barge in on people like that.

36:26.227 --> 36:28.688
I dropped the boys off at Jane's,
if that's all right.

36:29.897 --> 36:34.068
So that we could have a conversation.

36:34.151 --> 36:36.529
Is that your hint
for me to leave?

36:40.825 --> 36:41.825
Okay.

36:43.327 --> 36:45.621
- It's all right. Mm-hm.
- Okay, I'll call you later.

36:54.505 --> 36:55.673
Celeste...

36:58.593 --> 37:01.470
I do think you need to take some...

37:01.554 --> 37:03.306
Some real time to heal,

37:05.266 --> 37:11.063
and that while you do that,
I think Max and Josh should reside with me.

37:12.481 --> 37:13.774
No.

37:13.858 --> 37:15.276
No.

37:15.359 --> 37:17.028
- That won't be necessary.
- No, I...

37:17.111 --> 37:19.572
I think it is ne... It is necessary.

37:19.655 --> 37:23.242
- Look, last night was a misunderstanding...
- No, no, this is not about last night.

37:23.326 --> 37:25.661
It's about a whole totality of events.

37:28.789 --> 37:31.292
You're a mess, Celeste.

37:31.375 --> 37:33.252
And until you're better,

37:33.336 --> 37:37.423
we just have to think about
protecting the well-being of our boys.

37:37.506 --> 37:40.843
We should at least
be able to agree on that. Hmm?

37:40.927 --> 37:42.929
My boys will not be going
to live with you.

37:43.012 --> 37:46.849
But they're at risk here.
They're at risk in your care.

37:46.933 --> 37:49.769
And I'm their grandmother,
and I will not forsake them,

37:49.852 --> 37:54.148
and I will not forsake what I know
Perry would want me to do for them.

37:54.231 --> 37:56.359
I need you to get out of here.

37:56.442 --> 37:58.110
- Right now.
- We can calmly...

37:58.194 --> 37:59.612
No, no.

37:59.695 --> 38:01.489
- Celeste...
- Get the fuck out of here!

38:01.572 --> 38:04.742
Okay, I'm going to give you this
as a courtesy.

38:04.825 --> 38:06.494
- What?
- It's a...

38:06.577 --> 38:07.703
- What is it?
- A petition

38:07.787 --> 38:09.163
- No.
- for assignment

38:09.246 --> 38:11.290
- of the guardian of the person. Persons.
- What?

38:11.374 --> 38:12.875
- It's plural in this case.
- What?

38:12.959 --> 38:16.462
It'll be filed in the Monterey County
Superior Court tomorrow morning.

38:16.545 --> 38:18.965
We need to do what's best for the boys.

38:26.013 --> 38:27.932
- She could really lose her kids?
- Maybe.

38:28.015 --> 38:30.351
It's California law, and it's very tricky.

38:30.434 --> 38:32.520
- You got her a good lawyer.
- Good. She's good.

38:32.603 --> 38:37.650
But I would have had her hire Ira Farber,
and now I hear Mary Louise got him,

38:37.733 --> 38:40.277
- and that's why he was unavailable.
- Oh, my God.

38:40.361 --> 38:43.114
It's just everything feels like it's unraveling,
and Bonnie,

38:43.197 --> 38:46.742
- I don't know how she's keeping it together.
- I heard her mother is stable.

38:46.826 --> 38:48.327
- Hey, Madeline.
- Oh.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.454
- Hello.
- Hello.

38:50.538 --> 38:52.415
Renata.

38:52.498 --> 38:54.750
It's nice to see you both. You well?

38:54.834 --> 38:55.960
- Yeah.
- Great.

38:56.043 --> 38:58.587
- Yeah.
- You?

38:58.671 --> 39:02.466
Hey, I heard you gave a great talk
the other night at Otter Bay Assembly.

39:02.550 --> 39:04.176
Wish I'd seen that.

39:04.260 --> 39:06.387
People pull out their iPhones
at these things.

39:06.470 --> 39:10.099
I'm sure it's posted somewhere
on Instagram or something.

39:12.268 --> 39:13.310
I'll look for it.

39:14.895 --> 39:15.896
Have a good day.

39:19.859 --> 39:21.777
What the fuck was that?

39:24.989 --> 39:26.198
- Hi, Jane.
- Hi.

39:26.282 --> 39:28.868
- What a surpri...
- Can we have a conversation, please?

39:28.951 --> 39:30.286
Of course, come in.

39:30.369 --> 39:32.413
- Can I get you a cup of tea?
- No, I'm fine.

39:32.496 --> 39:36.876
I'm just a little bit curious as to what you're
doing and if you plan to take my kid next.

39:36.959 --> 39:40.254
What? What would make you think
that I would seek custody of Ziggy?

39:40.337 --> 39:43.132
- You're a wonderful, wonderful mother.
- So is Celeste.

39:43.215 --> 39:44.215
No. No, no.

39:44.258 --> 39:46.510
I have concerns about Celeste.

39:46.594 --> 39:50.222
Her mental and emotional health...

39:50.306 --> 39:52.224
I know you're her friend, Jane.

39:52.308 --> 39:55.686
But truly, do you not also worry?

39:55.770 --> 39:57.104
No. No, I don't.

39:57.188 --> 39:59.356
Well, put yourself in my shoes.

39:59.440 --> 40:02.568
If you became convinced
that the boys were at risk...

40:02.651 --> 40:04.779
- They're not at risk.
- Physically at risk.

40:04.862 --> 40:07.114
I've seen her as a mom.
She's a great parent.

40:07.198 --> 40:11.994
You have seen the outward appearance,
but I've seen the drawer, with, uh, Ambien

40:12.078 --> 40:16.624
and Vicodin and Xanax,
something with a tramma... I don't know.

40:16.707 --> 40:20.920
All these different medications,
and she's driving on these roads.

40:21.003 --> 40:24.340
Let me ask you,
do you ever put Ziggy in the car with her?

40:25.716 --> 40:29.762
Does he sit in the front next to her
when the twins are strapped in the back?

40:31.430 --> 40:32.848
Are you okay with that?

40:37.561 --> 40:40.397
- I'm not gonna testify against you.
- But they might force you.

40:40.481 --> 40:42.983
They might be able to, I don't know,
get a court order.

40:43.067 --> 40:46.487
Celeste, first of all, you can trust me.

40:46.570 --> 40:50.366
I trusted her,
so don't talk to me about trust right now.

40:50.449 --> 40:52.493
I let her into my life.

40:52.576 --> 40:54.745
I let her into my house.

40:54.829 --> 40:56.122
I tried to help her.

40:56.205 --> 40:59.333
Whatever you say to me
is doctor-patient privileged.

41:00.918 --> 41:04.505
- You know that.
- I don't feel strong enough to handle this.

41:04.588 --> 41:08.384
They're gonna wanna interview the kids,
and they've been through enough.

41:08.467 --> 41:11.303
We've all been through enough,
for God's sake.

41:13.722 --> 41:15.182
Maybe you can settle?

41:15.266 --> 41:19.186
Don't tell me to fucking settle.
I'm not settling anything with that woman.

41:19.270 --> 41:22.314
God. These are my kids.

41:22.398 --> 41:24.984
And she wants them.
She wants my boys.

41:25.067 --> 41:31.157
If she's seeking custody on the grounds
of parental unfitness or neglect...

41:31.240 --> 41:34.076
Whose side are you on, for God's sake?

41:34.160 --> 41:36.453
I've seen the way these things play out.
Nobody wins.

41:36.537 --> 41:39.123
I will win. I'll fucking win.

41:41.375 --> 41:42.375
God.

41:59.977 --> 42:00.977
Mama.

42:02.229 --> 42:03.229
Hi.

42:14.074 --> 42:15.159
What, Mama?

42:18.913 --> 42:19.913
