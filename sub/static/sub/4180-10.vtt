56:57.331 --> 56:58.912
You're kidding.

57:03.921 --> 57:05.331
How?

57:06.006 --> 57:07.086
What happened?

57:10.177 --> 57:12.463
He killed a nurse.

57:14.848 --> 57:16.179
Brutally.

57:21.438 --> 57:24.305
Now the feds will have to throw out
his testimony.

57:26.985 --> 57:28.941
Jesus,babe.

57:33.075 --> 57:34.986
He did that with you there?

57:35.452 --> 57:38.444
With a crucifix he gave Luann.

57:40.874 --> 57:43.206
He asked me to bring it to him.

57:45.671 --> 57:47.377
I did.

57:50.092 --> 57:51.878
Oh, shit.

57:53.137 --> 57:54.252
[SCOFFS]

57:54.429 --> 57:57.387
He had it all planned, Jax.

58:00.435 --> 58:03.472
He saved the MC, but he...

58:03.939 --> 58:06.726
...needed to hurt you.

58:09.695 --> 58:11.526
The way you hurt him.
Someone you love

58:11.697 --> 58:14.109
They're gonna find out
I gave him that murder weapon.

58:14.283 --> 58:16.319
Who I am, why I was there.

58:23.083 --> 58:26.075
He made me an accessory to murder.

58:31.258 --> 58:32.623
Babe.

58:34.011 --> 58:36.377
I'm not gonna let that happen.

58:37.806 --> 58:41.594
Okay? We're gonna get through this,
like we do everything else.

58:48.442 --> 58:51.354
That's what scares me the most.

58:59.494 --> 59:06.115
It's a blind ride

59:06.293 --> 59:10.912
That we do
