Captain's log, stardate 42695.3.

00:06.923 --> 00:11.135
We are the first manned vessel
to enter the Selcundi Drema sector.

00:11.344 --> 00:15.222
Unmanned probes have recorded
unusual levels of geological activity

00:15.432 --> 00:16.890
in all five planetary systems.

00:17.684 --> 00:21.145
l am hoping the Enterprise
will find the answer to this enigma.

00:21.354 --> 00:25.274
Commander, l have been reviewing
the unmanned probe scans.

00:25.483 --> 00:27.985
At some point
during the last 1 50 years,

00:28.194 --> 00:31.113
the fifth planet of Selcundi Drema
has shattered,

00:31.322 --> 00:33.115
forming an asteroid belt.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.576
l'd call that geological instability.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.536
ls there any indication
that this is the work

00:37.746 --> 00:38.954
of an unknown intelligence?

00:39.164 --> 00:41.582
This is geology, not malevolence.

00:41.791 --> 00:44.251
These planets live fast and die hard.

00:44.461 --> 00:47.129
The question is, why?

00:51.426 --> 00:53.385
- You're sure you won't reconsider?
- No.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.554
l'll just watch you and be impressed.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.974
An optimistic vote of confidence
from the non-rider.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.311
You know, l never particularly thought
of you as an animal person.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.188
Small animals, no.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.940
But horses...

01:11.071 --> 01:13.530
Computer, program the holodeck
for a woodland setting

01:13.740 --> 01:16.158
with a bridle path
and an appropriate mount.

Andorian Zabathu, Klingon Sark--?

01:19.245 --> 01:20.412
Horse. Earth horse.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.122
COMPUTER: Breed?
- Arabian.

01:22.332 --> 01:26.543
The Arabs believed that Allah gathered
the south wind and made the horse.

01:26.878 --> 01:30.464
On the holodeck,
we've made that legend come true.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.466

Hmm.

01:33.301 --> 01:34.593

01:48.483 --> 01:50.818
Oh, it goes deeper than that.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.821
A fine war horse would sleep
in a Bedouin's tent,

01:54.030 --> 01:55.823

01:56.032 --> 01:58.617

01:59.202 --> 02:03.789
There is a bond which is created
by mutual need.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.795
Hello, beautiful.

02:10.004 --> 02:11.630
Now, l understand.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.590
You don't want the comfort of a pet.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.551
You want a companion.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.469
Thank you.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.931
l don't want
to anthropomorphize anything.

02:23.059 --> 02:27.020
lt seems that some creatures
have the capacity

02:27.272 --> 02:31.567
to fill spaces

02:32.277 --> 02:34.611
l had a Betazoid kitten once.

02:35.572 --> 02:39.783
My mother and the cat reacted badly
to one another.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.375
Sure you don't want to try?

02:48.585 --> 02:50.169
lt's very relaxing.

02:50.378 --> 02:53.338
We can find you something
that would be quiet and gentle.

02:53.548 --> 02:58.635
No. l prefer a mode of transportation
that doesn't have a mind of its own.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.305
Strange.

03:01.514 --> 03:05.684
l would expect Betazoids
to be outstanding animal trainers.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.269
We become too involved

03:07.478 --> 03:10.189
in the thoughts and shifting passions
of the beast.

03:10.398 --> 03:13.775
We lose our way
and get swept up in emotion.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.153
l would have thought
the shifting passions of this beast

This is Commander Riker's meeting.

RlKER: l'll need your advice
and your recommendations.

06:10.119 --> 06:13.038
l've been given the responsibility
of overseeing Wesley's education.

06:13.247 --> 06:15.207
To further that,
l would like to put him in charge

06:15.416 --> 06:18.043
of the planetary mineral surveys.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.213
That's a big job
with a lot of responsibility.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.965
Well, the game isn't big enough
unless it scares you a little.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.635
To do the job,
Wesley's going to need a team.

06:26.844 --> 06:29.388
Takes command presence to lead.
Do you think he's ready for that?

06:29.597 --> 06:31.723
Leadership grows
from self-confidence,

06:31.933 --> 06:35.185
which is also part
of a Starfleet's officer's education.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.437
All of this is true,

06:37.647 --> 06:39.481
but there's an old
horse trainer's adage

06:39.690 --> 06:43.193
about putting too much weight
on a young back.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.612
We don't want him to break
under pressure.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.073

We seem to be shifting the focus here.

06:48.282 --> 06:52.577
Are we talking about a young officer
on the fast track to the Academy

06:52.787 --> 06:54.538
or are we talking about a young man

06:54.747 --> 06:56.915
that we are guiding
through adolescence

06:57.125 --> 06:58.417
and into adulthood?

06:58.626 --> 07:00.961
You can't guide someone
into adulthood.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.880
The experiences are unique
to each person.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.926
Whether Wes succeeds or fails,
he will learn from the experience.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.219
l agree.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.222
l'm just questioning the speed
at which we're moving.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.099
You think we're pushing him
too hard?

07:14.517 --> 07:16.726
l think that's a valid concern.

07:17.353 --> 07:20.063
Tempering is taken to extremes.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.816
He is a boy, not a sword.

07:23.025 --> 07:26.027
Who will one day become a man.
And...

07:26.237 --> 07:27.654
To extend the metaphor,

07:27.864 --> 07:31.491

that won't dull

07:31.701 --> 07:33.910
at the first touch of resistance.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.291
Sooner or later he'll have to feel
the burden of command.

Now, you should make use of them.
They are a valuable resource.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.857
And, by the way,

08:46.400 --> 08:50.737

who is prepared to admit ignorance

08:50.947 --> 08:52.531
and ask a question,
