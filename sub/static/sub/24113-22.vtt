destroy the Shadowhunters...

12:23.790 --> 12:26.670
...and rule the earthly realm,
side by side.

I got the invite. Alec...

13:22.120 --> 13:23.880
Congratulations.
I'm so happy for you.

13:23.880 --> 13:26.040
Thank you. You know, Magnus is

13:26.040 --> 13:27.290
taking care of everything...
Right.

13:27.290 --> 13:30.790
But there's a few things
I have to do, like...

13:31.880 --> 13:34.040
...asking you to be my suggenes.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.210
Again?

13:35.210 --> 13:37.290
Again. Yeah.

Alec, of course.

13:41.330 --> 13:44.040
Uh... there's also something
else I want to tell you.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.880
Um...

13:45.880 --> 13:49.000
I'm gonna be moving
into Magnus's apartment.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.380
Oh.

13:52.380 --> 13:54.000
That's not a problem, right?

No. I mean... there's no rule

Just, um...

14:06.380 --> 14:07.750
...don't be a stranger.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.330
Jace...

14:11.120 --> 14:13.000
You're my parabatai.

14:15.210 --> 14:16.880
you're right there, next to me.

So... you're not freaked out?

14:27.620 --> 14:29.210
Are you kidding?

14:29.210 --> 14:31.960
Two of my favorite people
are now a couple.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.040
I'm... I'm ecstatic.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.960
You don't know
how much that means to me.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.460
So... are you guys going
to the wedding together?

14:38.460 --> 14:40.040
That's the plan.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.460
Magnus and Alec were never
afraid to show the world

14:42.460 --> 14:44.120
how much they loved each other.

14:44.120 --> 14:47.210
So... I plan on following
in their footsteps.

14:47.210 --> 14:48.960
Izzy, um...

14:48.960 --> 14:52.210
what you did, the...
the courage that took,

14:52.210 --> 14:54.750
going to Edom alone,

14:54.750 --> 14:56.920
risking your life
to save Magnus,

14:56.920 --> 15:00.040
that was... beyond heroic.

15:00.040 --> 15:02.080
I could say the same thing
about you.

You saved my life, Clary.

(SIGHING)

What's wrong?

15:18.330 --> 15:19.920
I have a question for you.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.120
And... and you don't
have to answer right away.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.620
What is it?
And if the answer is no,

15:24.620 --> 15:26.000
I promise I won't be offended.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.210
OK, now you're
getting me worried.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.540
Isabelle.

15:34.210 --> 15:36.750
Would you ever consider...

15:36.750 --> 15:39.120
becoming my parabatai?

15:42.880 --> 15:45.710
I was thinking of asking you
the very same thing.

15:45.710 --> 15:47.290
(EXHALING HEAVILY) You were?

15:48.540 --> 15:51.540
You know, I always thought
I never needed a parabatai...

15:51.540 --> 15:53.920
that I was at my best
when I was on my own.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.290
But that was before I met you.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.500
Clary.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.420
I'd like nothing more

16:06.420 --> 16:09.120
than to have you
as my parabatai.

Underhill, it's OK. It's my dad.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.750
Hi!

16:31.250 --> 16:33.830
Luke, what happened?

16:33.830 --> 16:36.250
Well, the Praetor
made me inject myself

16:36.250 --> 16:38.880
with the Downworld cure, but
instead of becoming mundane,

16:38.880 --> 16:40.750
I became what I was
before I turned.

16:42.880 --> 16:46.290
Yeah. The good news is
I'm back where I belong:

working beside you, helping
mundanes and Downworlders alike.

16:49.290 --> 16:51.080

Look, I have to portal
to Alicante for a debriefing,

16:55.620 --> 16:58.790

You're better than OK.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.620

tell him that I'm gonna miss

miss his wedding.

But that's not why I'm here.

19:10.620 --> 19:12.380
Angel Raziel sent me.

19:12.380 --> 19:14.080
Raziel?

19:15.380 --> 19:16.460
Why?

19:16.460 --> 19:19.210
He believes if you'll
listen to anyone, it's me.

19:20.380 --> 19:22.710
Those thousands of years ago,

19:22.710 --> 19:26.290
he gave Jonathan Shadowhunter
each of his angelic runes

19:26.290 --> 19:28.250
for a specific purpose.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.420
Clary, the fact that you can
create your own runes

19:31.420 --> 19:34.040
without Raziel's blessing...

19:34.040 --> 19:37.120
Well, he does not
look kindly on that.

19:37.120 --> 19:40.170
But... the runes I draw, Mom...

19:40.170 --> 19:43.290
they help people.
They help Shadowhunters.

19:43.290 --> 19:45.830
That may be true,

19:45.830 --> 19:49.290
but you've been taking
advantage of your gifts.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.920
You felt the Angels' resistance,

19:52.920 --> 19:54.670
but you pushed through anyway.

19:56.420 --> 19:59.290
When you drew your
Necromancy Rune on Valentine,

19:59.290 --> 20:02.040
you broke a fundamental tenet...

20:02.040 --> 20:04.670
the dead shall stay dead.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.250
And now, this Alliance Rune...

20:09.250 --> 20:11.580
uniting Shadowhunters
with demonic blood.

20:12.580 --> 20:14.250
And for Raziel,

20:14.250 --> 20:15.790
that was the last straw.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.830
I did it to save
my friends' lives.

20:20.830 --> 20:22.120
I understand.

20:23.290 --> 20:27.710
Clary, your compassion is one of
the many great traits about you.

20:28.710 --> 20:31.830
But the Angels,
they see it differently.

20:34.040 --> 20:37.080
They perceive you as disrupting
the Natural Order.

20:39.330 --> 20:41.790

to scold me?

not to draw another rune
of your own ever again.

What?

as they gave you your gifts,

and supportive you were.

was even possible.

rallied for you,

for each other...

23:13.540 --> 23:15.710
It showed me a family
doesn't need to be
