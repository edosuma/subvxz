00:14.097 --> 00:16.141
Hi! Your entertainment is here.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.100
[laughs] Katie!

00:17.684 --> 00:19.060
Hey, you started without me.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.229
Yeah, I have VIP privileges here.

00:21.730 --> 00:22.731
Oh, donuts!

00:22.814 --> 00:24.899
-I got your favorite.
-Rainbow sprinkles?

00:26.067 --> 00:27.068
Where is it?

00:27.152 --> 00:28.403
You didn't let me finish.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.530
I sort of ate it.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.700
Hey, it's a long walk
from the donut place.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.160
The donut place in the lobby?

00:35.243 --> 00:36.161
That's the one.

00:37.245 --> 00:38.705
Megan! Donut?

00:38.788 --> 00:40.081
Ooh! Any rainbow sprinkles?

00:40.415 --> 00:41.875
Yeah, they were out.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.004
Oh, found our first-day-of-school outfits.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.339
[gasps] Fancy!

00:48.423 --> 00:50.967
Yeah, and when we wear it,
we have to look like this...

00:52.886 --> 00:55.430
Wait, does that mean Dr. Breitwieser
cleared you for school?

00:55.805 --> 00:58.808
I'm starting high school this Monday
just like everyone else.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.395
And I don't want anyone at school to know.
I'd hate it if they treated me all weird.

01:02.479 --> 01:06.357
[gasps] Especially Gwenny Thompson.
Can you imagine if she knew I'd been sick?

01:06.441 --> 01:07.567
Oh, yeah.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.944
You guys might start
being nice to each other.

01:10.028 --> 01:11.362
That would be horrible.

01:12.906 --> 01:16.534
OK, but when exactly is the doctor
going to let you know you're clear?

01:17.035 --> 01:19.662
I mean, did he never have
a first day of high school?

01:19.746 --> 01:21.581
Doesn't he know what this means to us?

01:21.664 --> 01:24.417
Can you sit down, please?
You're making me nervous around my IV.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.503
Wait, seriously?

01:26.586 --> 01:27.879
But I am... I am so care--

01:31.132 --> 01:32.258
Maybe I will sit.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.760
[Alexa laughs]

01:34.344 --> 01:35.762
[grunts] OK.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.057
Oh, and he's calling my mom
today at three.

01:39.140 --> 01:43.186
-What? Wait, why didn't you tell me?
-Because I knew you would go all Katie.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.355
Go all Katie?

01:45.438 --> 01:46.439
[Katie scoffs]

01:47.148 --> 01:50.360
I'm just saying, why call at three?
You know, if he knows, he knows.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.529
I mean, why not one? Why not two?

01:52.612 --> 01:53.613
Why not...

01:54.781 --> 01:58.118
Oh, yeah, this is going all Katie.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.329
[woman] Are you kidding me?

02:01.412 --> 02:02.580
Oh, what did you do?

02:02.664 --> 02:04.958
[chuckles] Something fun!

02:05.041 --> 02:06.084
Oh, she's coming!

02:07.836 --> 02:09.420
You two? Of course!

02:09.504 --> 02:11.381
Who put dye in the soap dispenser?

02:12.632 --> 02:13.883
I don't know who did it,

02:13.967 --> 02:16.511
but the bottle says
it comes off with vinegar.

02:16.886 --> 02:20.557
Alexa, there are many reasons why I'm glad
your treatments are almost over.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.396
[Alexa] This is the story
of how I beat cancer.

02:26.479 --> 02:29.524
When it all started, my nurse told me
to write down things I'm grateful for

02:29.607 --> 02:30.817
to help me be positive.

02:31.317 --> 02:33.736
That first day,
it was for grape popsicles,

02:33.820 --> 02:35.905
my family, and my best friend.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.158
I've been grateful for Katie a lot,

02:38.241 --> 02:40.326
but this time I'm super grateful for her.

A!

around strangers.

-Oh, I'm babysitting my brother.
-[chuckles] What?

03:52.523 --> 03:54.734
-Hey, guys!
-You put Jack on a leash?

03:54.817 --> 03:57.445
It's either this
or he sits at the table with us.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.405
-No.
-It's not that bad.

04:00.448 --> 04:04.369
Hey, first day of high school, let's dye
the tips of our hair the school colors.

04:04.452 --> 04:05.828
-Yes!
-I love that.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.748
I don't know what part of school
I'm the most excited about.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.708
-Going out for basketball.
-Pep rallies.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.293
-Football games.
-Dances.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.378
Cookies?

04:14.545 --> 04:17.340
-Did you eat all the samples?
-[mumbles] What samples?

04:19.008 --> 04:21.594
I'm weak!
You knew that when you brought me here.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.973
[groans] Gwenny's here.

[Gwenny chuckles]

04:29.227 --> 04:31.354
-Hello, Alexa.
-Hello, Gwenny.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.856
-Long time.
-Not long enough.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.818
Sorry you didn't make the basketball team.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.987
What? School hasn't even started.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.863
And now I'm in your head.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.658
Well, I'm in your head,
and there's an echo

04:43.741 --> 04:45.660
because there's nothing else
in here with me.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.330
'Cause everything left
when you walked in.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.748
Maybe I'll redecorate in here.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.126
-Don't you dare.
-Too late. It's done.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.337
Come on, guys.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.006
This place isn't cool any more.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.507
It will be when you leave.

04:59.590 --> 05:00.591
[Gwenny] Hm.

05:01.843 --> 05:02.844
[snarls]

05:05.054 --> 05:07.432
-Oh, we've got to go. It's almost three.
-What's at three?

05:07.515 --> 05:08.975
-Uh... Dog rescue.
-Piano lesson.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.144
-Piano lesson.
-Dog rescue.

05:11.894 --> 05:16.482
Yeah, we are volunteering
to teach piano to rescue dogs.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.110
It calms them.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.661
[sighs] What if the doctor
doesn't clear me for school?

05:28.745 --> 05:30.079
Hey, he will.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.165
But, uh, just in case...

05:33.333 --> 05:34.417
Way ahead of you.

My mom will be home any second.

we've been here for hours.

Honey, I am so sorry.
I could not get out of work.

06:04.238 --> 06:06.491
I hate missing your chemo. How did it go?

06:06.991 --> 06:08.117
It was fine. I...

06:08.493 --> 06:11.496
I came straight home, took a nap.
Here I am.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.414
You came straight home?

06:13.498 --> 06:16.125
Mom, we had an agreement.
How can you even ask?

06:16.876 --> 06:17.877
Is that your mocha?

06:18.169 --> 06:19.295
Yeah, from yesterday.

06:20.421 --> 06:21.964
And, yet, it's still warm.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.592
Climate change?

06:26.135 --> 06:28.596
-Hi, Katie.
-We hung out at the coffee shop!

06:30.306 --> 06:32.517
Hey, there was so much tension in the air.

06:33.768 --> 06:37.230
Alexa, you know
you're not supposed to get tired!

06:37.313 --> 06:40.024
I'm not even a little tired, Mom.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.026
-Did Dr. Breitwieser call?
-Not yet.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.279
We're gonna talk about this nap thing
when Katie's not around to hear me yell.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.281
No, we can hear you pretty good
from next door.

06:54.163 --> 06:56.624
-Hey, Lex.
-Oh, gross! You're sweaty!

06:56.707 --> 06:58.501
Yeah, I stink, too. Want a whiff?

-Hey, Katie.
-Great, thanks.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.561
[clears throat] But I am. Great, I mean.

Yeah, not to brag, just... just saying.

-Seriously?
-What?

since you were five.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.784
Now suddenly...

07:34.704 --> 07:36.330
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.249
You know he farts.

07:38.332 --> 07:41.669
He does not!

07:42.378 --> 07:43.379
We're out of milk.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.631
Oh, no! Milk is really important.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.343
Water's also good.

No, it's good.

08:00.563 --> 08:01.564
It's good.

08:02.356 --> 08:05.109
Hey, Lex, look at this.
You got a note from the principal.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.278
She says she's aware of your situation,

08:07.361 --> 08:10.072
and we can count on her
for any help and support we need.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.282
This is pretty cool.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.659
Mom, you've clearly lost touch
with what "cool" means,

08:13.743 --> 08:15.912
because it's not being besties
with your principal.

08:15.995 --> 08:16.996

08:17.079 --> 08:18.998
Yeah, Principal Trugly is horrible.

08:19.081 --> 08:21.709
I got detention for a week
just for skipping homeroom.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.836
No one can stand her.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.421
They call her Ugly Trugly.

That is awful!

-Juvenile.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.599
Well, not your father.

She loved your dad.

If he didn't have that Mustang,
I would have never...

10:41.432 --> 10:42.850
You could glitter your clipboard.

10:44.435 --> 10:45.811
Glitter's awesome.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.649
Look, not every kid
gets clearance from their doctor

10:49.732 --> 10:51.233
to go back to school this early.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.318
You're lucky.

10:52.401 --> 10:53.486
Lucky?

10:53.569 --> 10:56.906
That means no sports,
dances, being in plays.

10:56.989 --> 11:00.117
All that leaves is going to class.
Like, the worst part of school.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.037
That is a terrible attitude, young lady.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.831
Sorry, that was my mother talking.

11:06.582 --> 11:09.251
[sighs] Honey, I know it sucks,

11:09.335 --> 11:11.003
but it's just for right now.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.923
You're getting better,
and we don't want to risk that.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.009
I know.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.971
I just thought once school started,
things would go back to normal.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.932
And they're on their way.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.935
Before you know it, you're gonna be
lying to me about skipping homework

11:26.018 --> 11:27.395
instead of skipping naps.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.604
God, I hope so.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.570
We're starting high school together!
Let's celebrate.

11:36.654 --> 11:39.782
All right, yeah. Yeah. Uh...
Let's do something our moms will hate.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.034
I was thinking
more like an ice cream cone.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.621
With dangerous toppings.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.129
[giggles]

11:53.212 --> 11:54.880
I feel like such a bad girl.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.509
Now I have to figure out a way
to hide this from my mom.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.553
[Alexa sighs]

12:00.636 --> 12:01.637
All right.

12:01.720 --> 12:04.348
Cleared by the doctor, colored hair. Hm.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.392
Now all that's left
is to buy some new clothes,

12:06.475 --> 12:09.228
take Gwenny down, and I am
officially ready to start high school.

12:10.187 --> 12:13.023
Are you seriously going to keep
that stupid feud going?

12:13.107 --> 12:14.233
What choice do I have?

12:14.316 --> 12:15.901
Am I supposed to just let her win?

12:15.985 --> 12:17.486
It's an endless revenge cycle.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.655
Do you really think
anyone's ever going to win?

12:20.030 --> 12:20.948
Yeah.

12:21.449 --> 12:22.450
Me.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.328
Let's FaceTime Hannah and Reagan
and show them our new hair.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.496
Good idea.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.416
Does Lucas shave with this?

12:33.085 --> 12:34.628
What? I don't want to smell it.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.716
[cell phone ringing]

12:38.799 --> 12:40.092
Katie, wait. Um...

12:40.885 --> 12:42.928
Let's just surprise them when we see them.

12:43.721 --> 12:44.722
OK.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.141
-[cell phone chimes]
-Oh. Hm.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.268
Oh, that's my mom.
OK, I'll call you later.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.945
[Jack] Come on! Come on! Where are you?

13:00.404 --> 13:02.448
Are you seriously
going to touch every cookie?

13:02.531 --> 13:06.243
Why does every cookie
only have a single chocolate chip?

13:06.327 --> 13:08.454
Because you have a single parent.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.122
[Jennifer laughs]

13:11.290 --> 13:12.458
Nothing?

13:13.709 --> 13:15.294
I'm going next door to Alexa's.

13:15.377 --> 13:16.795
They've got Milanos.

13:16.879 --> 13:20.216
Bring me back one. Oh, and get yourself
something nice for your lunch tomorrow.

13:22.968 --> 13:26.096
So, how is Alexa feeling
about school starting?

13:26.180 --> 13:27.181
She's ready.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.268
High school's a really big change
and she's already going through so much.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.479
Mom, I'd know if she were worried, OK?

13:33.562 --> 13:35.898
Alexa and I
can practically read each other's minds.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.692
-[cell phone chimes]
-Like right now. That's her texting.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.196
-You're right.
-I can even tell you what it says.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.740
"Don't watch Project Runway without me."

13:44.823 --> 13:48.244
[chuckles] Close. It says, "Meet me in
the tree when you know your mom's asleep."

13:50.621 --> 13:51.747
[chuckles] Oh.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.582
And I'm obviously telling her,

13:53.666 --> 13:57.127
"Sorry, I'll be asleep myself then."
[chuckles]

13:57.920 --> 14:01.048
This is probably what they call
a "teachable moment"...

14:01.131 --> 14:02.258
but I'm gonna go take a bath.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.180
[window opening]

14:11.308 --> 14:12.309
[Katie grunts]

14:12.810 --> 14:14.144
What took you so long?

14:14.228 --> 14:17.314
[scoffs] Don't you mean, "Thanks for
meeting when you're supposed to be in bed,

14:17.398 --> 14:20.025
even though I know
you could get in trouble"?

14:20.860 --> 14:21.694
[exhales]

14:22.570 --> 14:25.781
OK. I need you to grab dark clothes and
as many rolls of toilet paper as you can.

14:26.323 --> 14:29.368
-Good night.
-Katie, wait! It's important.

14:30.327 --> 14:33.455
-I need to toilet paper Gwenny's house.
-Sounds like fun!

14:33.539 --> 14:35.499
-Good night.
-Katie, come on!

14:35.583 --> 14:38.878
Do you want to look back at your childhood
and know that you never teepeed a house?

14:38.961 --> 14:41.171
I do. I really do.

14:42.131 --> 14:45.009
What is going on with you, Alexa?
You're kind of losing your mind.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.303
I really need this right now.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.806
It's a good distraction
from everything else.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.893
Please?

14:53.976 --> 14:56.228
Oh, my gosh! OK, I'll do it.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.230
-This is going to be fun!
-Jack!

14:59.356 --> 15:01.442
Go to bed, and keep this to yourself.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.485
What if I go with you
and keep it to myself?

15:03.569 --> 15:05.529
If I don't strangle you,
you keep it to yourself?

15:05.613 --> 15:08.198
Mom said you're not allowed
to strangle me anymore.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.702
All right, all right. Let's just do it.

15:11.785 --> 15:13.662
-I'll go get the toilet paper!
-Shh!

15:14.413 --> 15:16.081
[whispers] I'll go get the toilet paper!

15:21.962 --> 15:23.714
[groans] Are we really doing this?

15:25.466 --> 15:26.926
Oh, we're doing this.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.218
Nice arm, Jack!

15:28.802 --> 15:29.929
Thanks!

15:35.059 --> 15:36.060
[sighs]

15:37.561 --> 15:39.104
Hey, are you all right?

15:39.730 --> 15:40.981
You know I hate that question.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.359
As my best friend,
you have to not ask me that ever again.

15:44.401 --> 15:47.112
As my best friend, you have to not
do things that wear you out.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.406
[Alexa sighs]

15:49.490 --> 15:51.659
OK, I'll sit here for a minute,
until I feel--

15:51.742 --> 15:52.910
-Better?
-No.

15:52.993 --> 15:54.787
Inspired. Go do the bushes.

15:55.579 --> 15:58.332
This is the best night of my life!

16:03.587 --> 16:05.756
[exhales] OK. I'm ready.

16:05.839 --> 16:06.840
OK.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.259
Wait, is that my ski cap?

16:09.343 --> 16:11.637
Oh, my gosh! I'll give it back.
Now, will you focus?

16:18.227 --> 16:20.604
Alexa, this isn't Gwenny's house!

16:20.688 --> 16:21.605
Really?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.107
It says "Trugly."

16:23.649 --> 16:26.902
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
This is our principal's house!

16:28.028 --> 16:30.447
Jack! Jack, we've got to go!

16:32.032 --> 16:32.866
Lex!

16:32.950 --> 16:35.619
-Lex, leave it!
-I'm almost done.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.705
We have to go right now!

16:48.465 --> 16:50.467
What do you think you're doing?

16:50.968 --> 16:52.761
I am calling your parents.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.555
This will not end well.

16:54.638 --> 16:55.639
Whoa!

16:56.473 --> 16:57.474
[Jack groans]

16:58.475 --> 17:00.394
My brain feels weird.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.439
Whoa!

17:04.356 --> 17:05.399
[Jack] I'm OK.

17:10.487 --> 17:12.740
I just hope Principal Trugly
doesn't remember me.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.576
I was always such a model student.
I'd hate to let her down.

17:17.327 --> 17:18.787
This is about Alexa, Dave.

17:19.246 --> 17:20.497
Yeah. Yeah, right. Of course.

17:23.167 --> 17:26.253
I just don't understand what made you do
something like that, Alexa.

17:26.336 --> 17:27.504
And with Jack.

17:27.588 --> 17:28.964
This is not like you, Katie.

17:29.381 --> 17:32.092
I am so sorry
Alexa dragged Katie into this.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.136
No, no, Lori.
I don't feel that way at all.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.055
Katie is in charge of her own behavior.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.931
Look, we can deal with
the girls ourselves,

17:38.015 --> 17:40.225
but we need to present
a united front to Trugly.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.686
We don't want them starting school
with a bad reputation.

17:42.770 --> 17:43.604
Absolutely.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.939
I know Trugly can be intimidating.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.107
I'm not afraid of her.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.610
-All right.
-It was all her daughter!

17:51.487 --> 17:53.447
-Jennifer!
-Sorry. I'm afraid of her.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.325
Please come in.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.749
-David?
-Oh, hey!

18:03.832 --> 18:05.417
Principal Trugly. [chuckles]

18:06.001 --> 18:07.628
One of the perpetrators is yours?

18:08.545 --> 18:11.173
In my defense, I am not around that much.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.887
I'm a pilot,
so really it's, uh... Captain Dave.

18:16.970 --> 18:17.971
[Dave laughs]

18:18.430 --> 18:19.681
We should go in now.

18:19.765 --> 18:20.766
Roger that.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.227
[door shuts]

18:24.520 --> 18:27.106
Suspended for three days? It's so unfair!

18:27.189 --> 18:30.109
It was just one day,
but then your mother jumped in.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.780
Long story short... you got three days
and Mom's banned from school for a month.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.115
It's so unfair!

18:37.908 --> 18:39.118
You kicked her trash can.

18:39.576 --> 18:40.828
I slipped.

18:40.911 --> 18:41.912
Twice?

18:44.289 --> 18:45.624
This can't be happening.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.877
We're never gonna have
a first day of high school.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.046
Trugly is crazy.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.341
Is this really what we're gonna be
dealing with for the next four years?

18:55.467 --> 18:57.344
Oh, I have an idea!

18:57.427 --> 18:59.888
Why don't Katie and I
go to Crawford High instead?

18:59.972 --> 19:01.932
That's across town.
We don't know anyone there.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.517
And they're our rivals.

19:06.186 --> 19:09.356
Oh, I know!
Mom, you could homeschool Katie and me.

19:09.439 --> 19:12.317
You mean, we wouldn't even go
to high school? That's crazy.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.861
We can learn in our pajamas.

19:13.944 --> 19:16.697
We've been waiting to start high school
since fourth grade.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.157
And I have a job.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.536
Dad, want to homeschool us?

19:22.619 --> 19:24.246
Oh, I love you...

19:24.329 --> 19:25.581
but I really don't.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.125
Neither do I.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.294
Not that anybody's asked.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.256
Alexa, what's really going on?

19:34.339 --> 19:35.340
Hold on.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.759
Did you know that was Trugly's house?

19:37.843 --> 19:39.303
How would I know?

19:40.012 --> 19:41.847
By having her address in your pocket.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.229
You lied about Gwenny.

19:50.105 --> 19:51.607
You wanted to get us in trouble.

19:52.316 --> 19:53.775
Why would you do that to me?

19:57.154 --> 19:58.155
[Katie sighs]

20:06.038 --> 20:08.290
[Jack yells] You're out of toilet paper!

20:09.041 --> 20:10.042
[sighs]

20:14.671 --> 20:15.923
[knocking]

20:16.006 --> 20:17.341
Go away, Alexa.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.595
I brought a cookie with two chips in it.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.097
Oh, it's you.

20:24.181 --> 20:26.767
You were hoping it was the person
you just told to go away?

20:28.477 --> 20:30.562
Lori brought your ski cap back.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.356
She said Alexa was really upset.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.108
Hm. Good. She should be.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.110
Why don't you go talk to her?

20:37.194 --> 20:39.613
No way! She should be coming to me.

20:39.988 --> 20:41.073
Whoa, three!

20:42.699 --> 20:43.700
Mm.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.411
She lied to me, Mom.

20:47.996 --> 20:48.997
All right.

20:50.165 --> 20:51.166
I'm sorry, honey.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.381
[door closes]

21:04.554 --> 21:05.639
[sighs]

21:07.224 --> 21:08.392
Oh, Alexa.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.231
[window opens]

21:15.607 --> 21:17.651
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Tell you what?

21:18.151 --> 21:20.821
-My ski hat?
-I gave it back. Let it go.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.615
No, Lex. I saw a lot of your hair in it.

21:24.741 --> 21:25.951
A lot.

21:26.785 --> 21:27.786
Oh.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.331
So why are you so mad?

21:32.165 --> 21:34.042
I'm the one who's losing my hair.

21:34.376 --> 21:35.836
I'm your best friend.

21:36.503 --> 21:39.089
I mean, you should have told me
what was going on.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.425
Like I would care if you have hair or not.

21:41.508 --> 21:42.509
All right.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.804
I don't want my stupid hair to fall out.

21:46.763 --> 21:49.933
And all of a sudden it is...
just as school is starting.

21:51.601 --> 21:53.770
That's why you wanted to get us suspended.

21:55.188 --> 21:57.858
Actually I was hoping for expelled,
but Trugly's gone soft.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.195
I don't want to go to school like this.

22:03.864 --> 22:06.575
But I don't want
to not go to school without you.

22:07.659 --> 22:08.660
That's sweet.

22:09.578 --> 22:10.620
And awful.

22:11.663 --> 22:12.748
It's "swawful".

22:15.208 --> 22:16.460
I'm sorry.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.089
And as much as I hate losing my hair,
it's more about--

22:21.173 --> 22:22.257
Everyone knowing.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.176
Hey, so what if they know?

22:24.259 --> 22:25.844
Because then I'm the sick girl.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.306
I-I want things to be how they were.

22:29.389 --> 22:31.683
I... I want to go out for basketball,

22:31.767 --> 22:34.561
and not keep things from my friends,
and take Gwenny down.

22:35.353 --> 22:36.480
[Alexa sighs]

22:36.563 --> 22:38.440
But now, when school starts,

22:38.523 --> 22:39.733
instead of seeing me...

22:40.776 --> 22:42.486
everybody's going to see cancer.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.614
Everybody's going to know me
as the sick girl,

22:45.697 --> 22:47.324
and I am so much more than that.

22:47.616 --> 22:50.077
Hey, they will figure it out, OK?

22:50.160 --> 22:52.829
You'll do something crazy and really dumb,

22:52.913 --> 22:55.457
and they will all get to see
exactly who you are.

22:58.752 --> 22:59.586
Yeah.

23:00.420 --> 23:03.215
It's just sometimes
it really, really sucks.

23:04.257 --> 23:06.593
And when my hair started coming out,
I-I panicked,

23:06.676 --> 23:08.178
and I took you down with me.

23:10.347 --> 23:11.556
I'm sorry.

23:13.892 --> 23:14.935
I have an idea.

23:23.443 --> 23:27.030
You think I should just shave it off?
Then everyone will definitely notice.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.658
What if you're not
the only one they're noticing?

23:30.242 --> 23:31.326
[buzzing]

23:32.744 --> 23:33.745
OK, Katie.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.539
[chuckles] Put it away.

23:35.997 --> 23:38.917
I get it. Y-You are the best friend
that anyone could...

23:39.000 --> 23:40.627
Oh, my gosh, Katie!

23:42.420 --> 23:44.589
Oh, you just did that.

23:46.758 --> 23:47.759
Hey.

23:48.718 --> 23:50.595
As long as you're my best friend...

23:51.304 --> 23:53.431
you are never going through
anything alone.

23:54.933 --> 23:55.934
Seriously?

23:57.018 --> 23:59.312
Yeah, I'm kind of committed now.

24:02.482 --> 24:03.316
So...

24:03.984 --> 24:05.068
how do I look?

24:07.529 --> 24:08.905
Really, really bad.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.282
[both chuckle]

24:16.204 --> 24:17.205
[buzzing]

24:24.546 --> 24:25.672
How about me?

24:26.214 --> 24:27.299
-Ridiculous.
-Yeah.

24:27.382 --> 24:28.550
[both laugh]

24:30.260 --> 24:32.512
Hey, if you promise
not to keep things from me,

24:32.596 --> 24:35.098
I promise I'll personally
take Gwenny down for you.

24:36.266 --> 24:37.434
Oh, that's a deal.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.646
-So, what kind of tattoos are we getting?
-What?

24:41.980 --> 24:44.774
No, not today. Just... planning ahead.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.200
[Alexa] The older I get,
the more I realize

24:53.283 --> 24:56.119
there are certain times in your life
that you really need a friend.

24:56.745 --> 24:59.164
But sometimes
you get something even better.

24:59.247 --> 25:00.582
You get a Katie.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.126
[chuckles] Oh.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.545
Three, two, one.

25:06.254 --> 25:09.216
