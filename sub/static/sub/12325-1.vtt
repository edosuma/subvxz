01:39.542 --> 01:41.442
- Thanks, hon.
- You got it.

01:51.561 --> 01:52.619
- Boo.
- Hey!

01:53.730 --> 01:55.925
Sorry, my mind was wandering.

01:56.099 --> 02:00.798
Totally understand. If I just ate one
of them burgers, I'd be in a trance too.

02:00.970 --> 02:02.460
So where's your friend?

02:05.274 --> 02:06.571
Honey?

02:07.443 --> 02:09.138
Your salad's up.

02:32.301 --> 02:34.963
Give me your driver's license
and registration.

02:37.106 --> 02:40.075
- You know why I stopped you?
- Yeah.

03:49.045 --> 03:50.034
Afternoon.

03:50.213 --> 03:52.545
Afternoon, sir. Hello.

03:52.715 --> 03:55.309
Sorry about the...

03:55.485 --> 03:57.578
We're just in the middle of moving and I...

03:57.753 --> 03:59.778
And I'm sorry.

03:59.956 --> 04:02.083
- Did you get my doll?
- Sweetie, hush.

04:03.025 --> 04:04.185
It's okay.

04:04.360 --> 04:07.454
I've got it, honey. It's a little banged up.

04:08.798 --> 04:10.288
Anyway, sorry again.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.393
Ever since lunch, she's been acting out.

04:13.569 --> 04:16.504
- I'm bored.
- Well, I know what that's like.

04:16.672 --> 04:20.438
But we need to be careful with our things
so everyone else can be safe too, right?

04:26.349 --> 04:29.113
- We won't let it happen again, sir.
- Great. Thanks a lot.

04:30.253 --> 04:31.379
Sweetie, stop that.

04:31.554 --> 04:33.681
I'm so sorry. She's belted in, but...

04:33.856 --> 04:37.189
Don't worry, it comes
with the territory. I'll get it.

05:04.887 --> 05:06.047
Keep your head down!

05:21.571 --> 05:24.563
Give me your hand! Give me your hand!

06:15.658 --> 06:18.286
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.259
So.

06:24.433 --> 06:26.697
That about sums it up.

06:29.305 --> 06:32.468
I heard about your commendation.
That's great.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.269
Thanks.

06:37.346 --> 06:41.749
Guys down at the station are saying
you might resign or something. Is that true?

06:42.184 --> 06:44.345
My dad would kill me.

06:48.491 --> 06:52.154
Here. Pete made me bring them over.

06:52.328 --> 06:55.491
"Get well soon" stuff.
I guess it just keeps coming in, so...

07:00.436 --> 07:03.496
- You wanna sit down, or...?
- Yeah.

07:24.460 --> 07:25.449
Stuff helping you?

07:27.997 --> 07:29.225
Some.

07:30.833 --> 07:34.200
You don't have to stay.
I don't really need visitors.

07:40.076 --> 07:42.636
So you gonna shoot
for detective now, or what?

07:43.746 --> 07:45.577
I just need a little time off.

07:48.084 --> 07:50.882
So they still never found
the bodies from that car, right?

07:51.053 --> 07:52.577
No.

07:53.622 --> 07:56.216
The car wasn't even registered,
if you can believe that.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.187
Well, who were they?

08:00.663 --> 08:02.324
Don't know.

08:07.837 --> 08:09.828
May never know.

08:15.911 --> 08:22.009
<i>Edward, I know that we haven't spoken
in a few years and things ended badly...</i>

08:22.184 --> 08:25.551
<i>...or I ended them badly,
to be more fair...</i>

08:25.721 --> 08:28.815
<i>...and I didn't wanna hurt you
any more than I did.</i>

08:29.592 --> 08:31.116
<i>Now I must.</i>

08:32.428 --> 08:35.294
<i>To the point. I have a daughter.</i>

08:35.898 --> 08:40.597
<i>She is a perfect child,
and her name is Rowan.</i>

08:41.303 --> 08:45.467
<i>She has been missing for two weeks now,
and I need your help.</i>

08:46.242 --> 08:47.766
<i>I should explain.</i>

08:48.043 --> 08:51.604
<i>I live on Summersisle,
a tiny place in Puget Sound.</i>

08:51.781 --> 08:53.544
<i>I doubt you've heard of it.</i>

08:53.716 --> 08:58.210
<i>It is where I grew up. Do you remember
how you always used to ask me?</i>

08:58.487 --> 09:00.114
<i>Now you know.</i>

09:01.056 --> 09:04.287
<i>Rowan couldn't have left the island
by herself. She's too young.</i>

09:05.795 --> 09:07.956
<i>I have tried to find her on my own...</i>

09:08.130 --> 09:10.963
<i>...but am receiving little help
from the community.</i>

09:11.133 --> 09:14.398
<i>I fear she is in danger,
so now I turn to you.</i>

09:14.937 --> 09:17.303
<i>I pray that you'll forgive me.</i>

09:17.773 --> 09:19.968
<i>Yours fondly, Willow Woodward.</i>

09:26.782 --> 09:28.249
Hello?

09:29.819 --> 09:31.343
Hello?

09:45.334 --> 09:46.767
Eddie. How's it going?

09:46.936 --> 09:49.029
Good, thank you.

09:50.005 --> 09:52.235
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:52.708 --> 09:53.868
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:54.043 --> 09:55.169
- How you doing?
- Better.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.209
- Are you back?
- Not for a couple weeks.

09:57.813 --> 10:00.213
You didn't see this woman come in,
by any chance?

10:01.116 --> 10:03.516
- No, why?
- Because, no stamp.

10:05.020 --> 10:06.419
Read it.

10:12.895 --> 10:16.126
The plot thickens.
Didn't even know you had a plot.

10:16.298 --> 10:17.390
No kidding.

10:17.566 --> 10:19.898
So is this, like,
some old girlfriend or something?

10:20.636 --> 10:21.625
This Willow?

10:21.804 --> 10:24.204
No, no, she was...

10:25.674 --> 10:27.301
- We were engaged.
- What?

10:27.476 --> 10:31.606
We were, you know, close,
and then she took off on me.

10:31.780 --> 10:34.544
Yeah. Sounds like she got close
with someone else too.

10:35.284 --> 10:37.752
And she's got the nerve
to contact you now? Shit.

10:37.920 --> 10:41.686
I know. I know.
It's the fact that I'm a cop, I guess.

10:41.857 --> 10:44.223
- We need to be in that briefing.
- Okay.

10:45.494 --> 10:48.429
- Hey. It's good to see you.
- Yeah.

10:50.065 --> 10:52.465
- You're gonna blow this off, right?
- I don't know.

10:52.635 --> 10:54.432
Yeah, I'm pissed off at her.

10:54.603 --> 10:55.763
Come on.

10:55.938 --> 10:58.304
You haven't seen this girl in,
like, what? Forever?

10:58.474 --> 11:01.204
Her kid's missing, Pete, okay?
I might be all she's got.

11:01.377 --> 11:03.277
Tell her to contact the father.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.539
- I'm just saying.
- Yeah, I get it. I'm just...

11:06.715 --> 11:10.048
Why don't you do a little digging
on her first? I mean, come on.

11:10.619 --> 11:13.087
Summersisle? Where the hell is that?

11:13.255 --> 11:14.847
Yeah. This is all I could find.

11:15.024 --> 11:18.221
It's privately owned
out in the Pacific Northwest.

11:18.394 --> 11:21.921
It's some sort of farming commune
or whatever.

11:22.097 --> 11:24.156
Yeah, like the Amish or something.

11:25.634 --> 11:26.862
Give her a call.

11:27.036 --> 11:30.403
I already tried, but guess what.
There's no phone service on Summersisle.

11:31.373 --> 11:33.466
Summersisle.

12:45.648 --> 12:47.411
Hey, Pete, it's me.

12:48.183 --> 12:52.847
Hey, I'm glad I got your machine,
because you'll probably laugh at me, but...

12:53.022 --> 12:54.717
Hello?

12:55.224 --> 12:56.748
Hello?

13:10.739 --> 13:11.967
Ahoy there.

13:13.242 --> 13:14.869
What was that?

13:15.044 --> 13:17.035
I don't know
what you're supposed to say.

13:17.212 --> 13:18.509
Then I'd just go with hello.

13:18.681 --> 13:20.046
Right. Hello.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.483
You know about a place
called Summersisle?

13:24.119 --> 13:26.952
Yes, I do. I make most
of the deliveries around there.

13:27.122 --> 13:28.248
Deliveries, huh?

13:28.424 --> 13:31.518
Yep. Just about every day.
That's what I'm doing now.

13:31.694 --> 13:33.662
What would I have to do
to catch a ride?

13:33.829 --> 13:38.459
Oh, no. I don't care to lose my contract
with these folks. They're very particular.

13:38.634 --> 13:41.068
All right, then just drop me down
on the beach...

13:41.236 --> 13:43.534
...or whatever they have,
and I'll walk into town.

13:43.706 --> 13:45.230
The answer's still no.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.967
It's just a few miles.
I could practically swim that.

13:48.143 --> 13:49.610
You better start swimming, then.

13:50.779 --> 13:51.973
Why? What's the big deal?

13:52.147 --> 13:55.639
Because it's private.
It's off-limits, and we respect that.

13:55.818 --> 13:58.150
We're all private people around here.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.517
Yeah, but you're so warm and open,
it really makes up for it.

14:02.891 --> 14:04.153
I'm just kidding.

14:04.326 --> 14:06.658
Okay, look, how about
you take all of us there?

14:06.829 --> 14:08.797
What do you mean, "all"?

14:08.964 --> 14:10.295
Well, me...

14:10.466 --> 14:12.991
...Mr. Grant here
and his twin brother Ulysses.

15:44.827 --> 15:46.522
Lost your bearings?

15:46.695 --> 15:50.062
Oh, hey. Sorry.
You snuck up on me there.

15:50.999 --> 15:52.261
I don't think so.

15:52.434 --> 15:54.902
- This is Summersisle, right?
- Yes.

15:55.070 --> 15:57.937
- In the right place.
- Afraid not. This is private property.

15:58.106 --> 16:00.631
You can't land here without permission.

16:00.809 --> 16:05.212
Listen, I completely understand,
but I was invited here.

16:06.648 --> 16:09.412
- I'm a cop.
- And what does that mean?

16:09.585 --> 16:13.180
A police officer.
I do what I can for people. Help them out.

16:14.156 --> 16:17.091
Now, a complaint has been made
by a resident of this island.

16:17.259 --> 16:18.248
A complaint, you say?

16:18.427 --> 16:20.088
Yes, ma'am. About a missing child.

16:20.262 --> 16:22.560
Well, now, that's always trouble.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.631
Yep. For everybody.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.997
Perhaps you should take these matters up
with Sister Summersisle.

16:28.170 --> 16:31.264
She's very particular
about anyone landing here.

16:31.707 --> 16:33.607
How did you land here, by the way?

16:34.910 --> 16:36.502
Was it the harbor pilot?

16:36.678 --> 16:38.111
He just...

16:39.948 --> 16:41.438
He'll need a good talking-to.

16:41.617 --> 16:45.109
What's in the bag?
A shark or something?

16:50.893 --> 16:52.326
Do you know her?

16:53.362 --> 16:55.330
I don't recognize this child.

16:55.497 --> 16:57.727
- Do you, Violet?
- No. Can't say I do.

16:57.900 --> 17:01.427
Just a tip there. It often helps
to actually glance at the photo.

17:02.170 --> 17:04.832
What are you telling me?
This girl isn't from the island?

17:05.007 --> 17:06.598
Doesn't appear to be.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.640
Her mother's name is Willow.

17:09.411 --> 17:11.777
Sister Willow.

17:11.946 --> 17:14.313
She quite slipped my mind.

17:14.483 --> 17:17.247
Yes, we have a Willow here, all right.

17:17.419 --> 17:20.387
- Just up the way at the meetinghouse.
- What a coincidence.

17:20.555 --> 17:22.352
Bit of a free spirit.

17:23.724 --> 17:24.987
Your bag is dripping.

17:30.732 --> 17:32.063
Go on.

17:32.467 --> 17:34.298
Take a peek.

17:59.628 --> 18:00.890
That's not her daughter.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.711
Must be ladies' night.

18:18.880 --> 18:23.374
Hi. Are you the barmaid in here,
or whatever you call it?

18:23.552 --> 18:25.417
I'm Sister Beech, yes.

18:25.587 --> 18:28.556
And you're that officer from California?

18:30.425 --> 18:33.019
That's right. Name is Malus.

18:33.695 --> 18:37.722
Edward Malus.
I'd just like a room and a meal.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.958
- Can you swing it?
- Swing what?

18:40.135 --> 18:42.035
Is that some kind of city talk?

18:43.605 --> 18:47.473
Manage. That's what he means.
Can we manage to put him up?

18:48.243 --> 18:53.010
Well, since he didn't take the hint
and leave, I suppose we'll have to.

18:53.181 --> 18:54.739
For one night, at least.

18:54.916 --> 18:55.974
Welcome.

18:59.554 --> 19:02.955
This is Mr. Malus,
an officer from the mainland.

19:03.425 --> 19:05.484
- And this is...
- Willow.

19:06.461 --> 19:08.429
Of course.

19:12.868 --> 19:14.995
She'll show you upstairs.

19:17.205 --> 19:20.106
There's an empty room on the top floor.

19:23.712 --> 19:25.543
I think I'll have a drink first.

19:26.982 --> 19:29.644
As long as I'm not intruding.

19:30.252 --> 19:34.814
This here is mead.
It's one of the pleasures of our island.

19:35.323 --> 19:37.587
A brew of honey, herbs...

19:38.427 --> 19:40.122
...and whatnot.

19:41.329 --> 19:42.956
Thanks.

19:45.467 --> 19:47.128
Yeah.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.174
I think you ought to know.

20:01.249 --> 20:03.717
I think you all should know
that I'm here on business.

20:03.885 --> 20:08.219
This is official police business and I wanna
speak to each one of you at some point.

20:10.158 --> 20:12.820
Official California business, is it?

20:12.994 --> 20:15.827
Because this is Washington.

20:15.997 --> 20:16.986
I'm aware of that.

20:17.165 --> 20:18.189
- Then fine.
- No.

20:18.366 --> 20:23.861
Mrs. Beech, it is not fine.
It is anything but fine when a person is lost.

20:24.039 --> 20:25.063
Especially a child.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.188
Now, why would you go
and do a thing like that?

20:41.490 --> 20:43.390
Sorry, I'm allergic.

21:07.983 --> 21:12.352
<i>I am being watched,
but we must try to speak later in private.</i>

21:12.521 --> 21:17.220
<i>There's a place out beyond the point.
Meet me there in an hour.</i>

21:17.392 --> 21:22.420
<i>Edward, be careful
and believe nothing that you see or hear.</i>

21:22.597 --> 21:27.159
<i>My God, to see your face again...</i>

21:34.142 --> 21:38.272
You know, traditionally, the guy gets
his ring back when the fiancée runs away.

21:42.083 --> 21:45.575
I still wear it, sort of.

21:50.859 --> 21:52.827
I don't know what I would've done
if you hadn't come.

21:53.295 --> 21:56.025
- How could I not?
- Easily.

21:56.198 --> 22:00.760
You could've thought I was a madwoman
or something raving about my lost daughter.

22:01.536 --> 22:02.798
They all do.

22:02.971 --> 22:08.034
Look, I'm barely adjusted to the fact
that you have a daughter, okay?

22:08.210 --> 22:09.973
So let's go slow here.

22:13.548 --> 22:14.742
So...

22:15.450 --> 22:17.714
No. No.

22:17.886 --> 22:21.652
That's the only way to start this.
What in the hell happened to you?

22:21.823 --> 22:22.812
I didn't...

22:27.762 --> 22:30.788
Look, it was a long time ago.
We were young.

22:30.966 --> 22:32.593
So what?

22:34.336 --> 22:36.463
Well, why do we do anything in this life?

22:39.174 --> 22:42.007
I need some kind of answer here.

22:44.779 --> 22:46.770
Was it some other guy, or...?

22:46.948 --> 22:50.281
I mean, obviously,
you met someone, but...

22:52.354 --> 22:54.914
Look, I was scared and...

22:57.459 --> 22:59.927
I don't know, I just...
I wasn't ready for this...

23:01.997 --> 23:03.726
...so I ran back home.

23:03.898 --> 23:08.164
It's quite a home, by the way.
This place.

23:08.336 --> 23:12.432
We're different here. I know that.

23:13.441 --> 23:17.707
If you've grown up around it,
it's one thing, but it's...

23:19.047 --> 23:22.073
Yes, odd.

23:23.652 --> 23:24.914
Anyway...

23:25.387 --> 23:29.551
My daughter is what matters
to me now. Rowan.

23:32.027 --> 23:33.858
Why do this?

23:35.964 --> 23:39.195
Stir this all up again? It's so...

23:43.338 --> 23:45.329
Why don't you just
get her dad to help you?

23:45.507 --> 23:48.374
Because the only person I trust is you.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.645
Even after all these years.

23:57.919 --> 23:59.614
Edward.

24:00.388 --> 24:04.119
People will try to mislead you, they will,
but you must trust me.

24:04.292 --> 24:06.692
- I wanna help you, but...
- No, she has been taken.

24:06.861 --> 24:10.854
By who, I don't know. I don't.
But my little girl is still here.

24:11.032 --> 24:15.298
I promise you, if she's here, I'll find her.

24:15.470 --> 24:18.268
- I know you will.
- I'm gonna need to ask you some questions.

24:19.708 --> 24:22.734
Okay. I'll meet you again
as soon as it's safe. I have to go now.

24:42.764 --> 24:44.459
Leave us.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.629
Greetings, Sister Beech.

24:51.206 --> 24:53.401
A lovely evening.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.543
It is indeed. Welcome, all.

24:57.746 --> 25:00.806
Will Sister Summersisle bless us
with her presence?

25:00.982 --> 25:02.779
I'm afraid not.

25:02.951 --> 25:07.217
Enjoy the night. Only, make sure
you're ready for the day of tomorrow.

25:07.389 --> 25:10.256
The time of death and rebirth.

25:11.559 --> 25:15.962
- Yes. Of the Wicker Man's return.
- Yes. Of the Wicker Man's return.

25:18.533 --> 25:19.830
Excuse me.

25:20.802 --> 25:23.828
Did someone unpack my bag?
Because I'm missing some tapes.

25:24.005 --> 25:26.667
<i>- I wouldn't know.
- They're called Everything's OK!</i>

25:27.475 --> 25:28.908
Good.

25:53.034 --> 25:57.971
<i>Edward, I know that we haven't spoken
in a few years and things ended badly...</i>

25:59.808 --> 26:02.470
<i>...or I ended them badly, to be more fair.</i>

26:02.877 --> 26:05.311
<i>I didn't wanna hurt you
any more than I did.</i>

26:05.480 --> 26:06.947
<i>Now I must.</i>

26:11.953 --> 26:13.944
<i>That's not her daughter.</i>

26:23.298 --> 26:24.492
Did you get my doll?

26:24.666 --> 26:27.396
Yeah, I got it, honey.
It's a little banged up.

27:45.079 --> 27:46.376
Rowan?

28:27.188 --> 28:28.746
Rowan?

28:41.436 --> 28:43.097
Rowan?

29:39.027 --> 29:40.619
Hello?

29:45.767 --> 29:47.325
Rowan?

31:05.179 --> 31:08.637
Why do you have store-bought?
I thought you made this stuff here.

31:11.919 --> 31:13.978
Look, I just serve what I'm handed.

31:14.756 --> 31:18.123
If you don't like it, you'll have
to talk to Sister Beech, all right?

31:18.292 --> 31:20.317
What's with this "sister" thing, anyway?

31:20.962 --> 31:23.988
It's just our way.
We don't have any Royal Honey for you.

31:25.299 --> 31:26.288
None at all?

31:26.467 --> 31:28.435
No, not a drop.

31:29.437 --> 31:31.962
Our crop was cursed last year.

31:34.876 --> 31:36.639
I might find you
a little bit of sugar.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.743
All right.

31:41.949 --> 31:43.507
Okay.

32:25.793 --> 32:27.988
Mr. Malus? Your sweetener.

32:28.162 --> 32:31.689
Thanks. What are these?
Festivals of some kind?

32:31.866 --> 32:36.633
That's right, our Harvest Festival.
We have one the end of each autumn.

32:36.804 --> 32:40.103
And then the Festival of Fertility too,
of course.

32:40.274 --> 32:44.176
But that's too sacred.
No pictures can be taken of that.

32:45.313 --> 32:47.474
What happened to last year's?

32:48.783 --> 32:53.117
Afraid it got ruined last night. Broke.

33:21.849 --> 33:25.410
Hey. I meant to ask you in there,
do you recognize this girl?

33:30.892 --> 33:32.359
No?

33:37.131 --> 33:41.295
- Where's the other woman who works here?
- She's gone up to the village school.

33:43.437 --> 33:45.234
Where is that?

33:46.374 --> 33:48.274
Up the hill and through the woods.

33:51.712 --> 33:53.339
All right. Perfect.

33:56.050 --> 33:57.312
Look, I'm sorry.

33:58.586 --> 34:01.180
What's happening here
the day of tomorrow?

34:01.622 --> 34:05.786
You mean, the day after tomorrow?
It's kind of a strange way to put it.

34:05.960 --> 34:10.123
Yeah, I suppose.
I thought the other was a local expression.

34:10.297 --> 34:11.286
Let's see.

34:11.465 --> 34:16.869
The day after tomorrow would be
May the 2nd. Nothing, as far as I know.

34:17.038 --> 34:20.063
No, I mean tomorrow.
What's happening here then?

34:20.675 --> 34:21.664
I told you.

34:22.743 --> 34:24.210
You did?

34:26.013 --> 34:29.141
When you leave,
will you take me with you?

35:13.594 --> 35:14.583
Hi.

35:20.101 --> 35:21.466
Good morning.

35:40.955 --> 35:45.756
And, Daisy, will you tell us
what man represents in his purest form?

35:49.830 --> 35:54.529
- Yes.
- Phallic symbol. Phallic symbol.

35:56.404 --> 35:58.497
School's really changed
since I was a kid.

35:58.672 --> 36:01.732
How dare you stand there
and frighten my children.

36:01.909 --> 36:05.242
Sorry. I'm Edward Malus from California.

36:05.413 --> 36:09.247
I'm a policeman. See my badge?

36:09.417 --> 36:11.977
I was unaware
any of my girls needed arresting.

36:12.153 --> 36:13.586
They don't, no.

36:13.754 --> 36:17.121
I'm here to find a missing girl
whom people are pretending doesn't exist.

36:17.291 --> 36:19.452
- How quixotic of you.
- Quixotic?

36:19.627 --> 36:24.655
From Don Quixote, pursuer of lofty
but impractical ideals.

36:24.832 --> 36:27.130
Usually a man.

36:27.301 --> 36:30.099
Look, I just need to speak
to Willow Woodward. Is she here?

36:31.205 --> 36:36.006
Already gone, I'm afraid. You're late.
And the law won't help you with that.

36:38.646 --> 36:40.671
Let me have your attention
for a second.

36:40.848 --> 36:44.841
As you might've heard, I'm here to verify
the whereabouts of a young girl.

36:48.921 --> 36:50.786
- What's your name?
- Lily.

36:50.990 --> 36:52.924
Lily, I'm Officer Ed. Hi.

36:53.092 --> 36:55.185
Could you pass that around
for me, sweetheart?

37:12.612 --> 37:14.944
That is her name, Rowan Woodward.

37:15.114 --> 37:18.550
Do any of you recognize the name
or the photograph?

37:22.121 --> 37:24.214
There's your answer.

37:24.390 --> 37:28.850
If she existed, we would know of her.
Now, will you please go?

37:33.699 --> 37:35.894
Whose desk is this?

37:43.609 --> 37:44.871
What?!

37:47.146 --> 37:50.877
We trapped the little bird inside
to see how long he can stand it.

37:52.752 --> 37:56.381
Now, why in the hell would you let them
do a sick thing like that?

37:58.324 --> 38:01.418
- Where's the attendance?
- You have Sister Summersisle's authority?

38:01.594 --> 38:04.358
No, I do not have...
You forget that this is a legal matter.

38:04.530 --> 38:07.226
Well, I'm afraid
you still need her permission.

38:11.370 --> 38:13.065
Put that back. Put that back.

38:13.239 --> 38:16.140
Sorry. You're gonna have
to bear with me.

38:30.323 --> 38:31.620
You little liars.

38:32.858 --> 38:35.656
Rowan Woodward is your classmate,
isn't she?

38:36.362 --> 38:40.230
Isn't she? That is her desk.

38:40.399 --> 38:41.525
You're the biggest liar.

38:41.701 --> 38:44.636
I'm warning you, you tell me another
and I'll arrest you myself.

38:44.804 --> 38:47.068
That is a promise, Miss...?

38:47.240 --> 38:48.605
Rose. Sister Rose.

38:48.774 --> 38:51.436
Of course. Another plant. Rose.

38:51.611 --> 38:54.739
For the last time, where is this girl?

38:54.914 --> 38:57.246
I'll speak to you outside.

38:57.783 --> 39:00.479
Girls, continue with your compositions.

39:20.573 --> 39:22.666
- Well?
- You don't understand.

39:22.842 --> 39:25.640
That's exactly right. I do not understand.
But I'm going to.

39:25.811 --> 39:28.507
Mr. Malus, no one is lying to you.

39:28.681 --> 39:31.479
I told you that if Rowan Woodward existed,
we'd know of her.

39:31.651 --> 39:33.642
If she existed? If?

39:33.819 --> 39:38.483
- But you cannot come barging into our...
- I saw that she existed with my own eyes.

39:38.658 --> 39:41.923
And I suppose her mother is lying
to me too, huh? She's lying?

39:42.094 --> 39:44.028
Not lying, no.

39:44.196 --> 39:45.959
Grieving.

39:46.599 --> 39:48.464
We all are.

39:50.369 --> 39:52.963
Wait, wait, wait.
When you say that she's grieving...

39:53.139 --> 39:56.040
...you mean that Rowan is dead?

39:56.208 --> 39:57.869
You would say so. Yes.

39:58.044 --> 40:01.207
- She's dead or she isn't?
- We never use that word here.

40:01.380 --> 40:02.870
No, that'd be too quixotic.

40:03.049 --> 40:04.311
Yes.

40:04.483 --> 40:08.647
You see, we believe that after
the human life is over, the soul lives on...

40:08.821 --> 40:11.984
...in air, in the trees, in animals,
in fire, even.

40:12.158 --> 40:16.492
All right, all right, just... Come on.
Tell me what happened to her. Honestly.

40:18.497 --> 40:20.897
- It was an accident.
- What kind of accident? How?

40:21.567 --> 40:25.025
Mr. Malus, it was an accident.
Leave things alone, please.

40:25.738 --> 40:28.002
Now, if that's true, where's her body?

40:28.174 --> 40:31.234
Exactly where you would expect it to be.
In the earth.

40:31.410 --> 40:33.105
In a churchyard?

40:33.279 --> 40:34.678
Her mother insisted.

40:35.247 --> 40:38.341
Now, if you will excuse me,
I have to get back to my class.

40:40.186 --> 40:44.054
Wait, wait, Miss Ro... Sister Rose.
Wait a minute.

40:44.990 --> 40:46.514
How'd she die?

40:46.692 --> 40:48.819
She'll burn to death.

40:49.095 --> 40:51.586
What? What'd you just say?

40:53.599 --> 40:57.729
Precisely what I meant to.
She burned to death.

41:20.226 --> 41:21.386
Excuse me.

41:22.228 --> 41:25.891
- Is there some church near here?
- Yeah.

41:26.065 --> 41:27.054
Down the hill.

41:28.968 --> 41:33.496
Hey, didn't I just speak with you?
Miss Rose... Sister Rose.

41:33.906 --> 41:34.930
No, you didn't.

42:23.189 --> 42:26.989
- That's not Rowan's grave.
- All right.

42:27.159 --> 42:31.152
It isn't. I know that this seems...

42:31.964 --> 42:33.693
But they put it there. I didn't.

42:34.533 --> 42:36.023
Who's "they"?

42:41.307 --> 42:42.899
I don't know.

42:43.476 --> 42:47.412
Whoever's doing this, trying to make...

43:00.960 --> 43:05.488
It's not much now,
but it used to be lovely.

43:05.664 --> 43:08.064
That's what they say, anyway.

43:08.234 --> 43:10.896
It was built before
my ancestors came here.

43:12.004 --> 43:14.905
That's the crypt, but it's all flooded.

43:15.341 --> 43:16.672
It's a new lock.

43:23.148 --> 43:24.308
Rowan is alive.

43:28.420 --> 43:31.116
That's not what folks
have been telling me.

43:32.791 --> 43:36.249
I've heard that she doesn't exist,
that she's buried in that graveyard...

43:36.862 --> 43:38.921
...even that she's...

43:40.366 --> 43:42.493
She burnt to death.

43:43.068 --> 43:47.562
The liars!
They can't accept her, or won't.

43:47.740 --> 43:50.766
They seem to blame her for all...

43:56.515 --> 44:01.248
Edward, I think
they're gonna hurt her, or even...

44:01.420 --> 44:05.857
Why would they?
I'm trying to understand. I am.

44:06.025 --> 44:07.720
But why?

44:09.395 --> 44:15.163
I ran off once, tried to get away.
They think I'm too proud, or that I...

44:18.203 --> 44:21.536
Sister Summersisle has never been
very fond of my wild ways.

44:21.707 --> 44:26.804
Yeah, that name keeps coming up.
This Summersisle.

44:29.515 --> 44:32.416
- Who is she?
- She's everything.

44:33.052 --> 44:36.351
Everything you see,
all of it, really, is her.

44:36.522 --> 44:39.582
The rest of us, we just...
We live in her shadow.

44:40.659 --> 44:42.126
Me, especially.

44:46.265 --> 44:48.392
They're all saying I've lost it?

44:48.867 --> 44:50.266
I haven't, Edward.

44:50.436 --> 44:52.768
I promise, I haven't. She's...

44:56.175 --> 44:59.042
I can't let them do this to me.

45:00.879 --> 45:03.677
Do what?
What is it you're not telling me?

45:04.750 --> 45:06.240
Forgive me?

45:07.686 --> 45:09.847
Forgive you for...?

45:11.123 --> 45:12.317
I'm lost.

45:12.491 --> 45:14.618
I don't know.

45:16.128 --> 45:17.493
Don't worry, it's...

45:18.464 --> 45:19.590
You know?

45:19.765 --> 45:23.701
No. I don't know. I do not know
that our daughter's gonna be okay.

45:30.876 --> 45:33.777
Now you know
what I've been trying to tell you.

45:35.214 --> 45:38.115
Why I need you to help me.

45:43.288 --> 45:47.190
You're telling me I'm Rowan's father?

45:48.293 --> 45:49.920
Yes.

46:03.809 --> 46:05.470
That's not right.

46:14.119 --> 46:16.417
You should have told me, Willow.

46:32.938 --> 46:34.929
So this is where you last saw Rowan?

46:36.241 --> 46:37.674
Yeah?

46:38.410 --> 46:40.878
Can you give me the details?
It's important.

46:42.047 --> 46:45.244
Yeah. The last time I saw her was...

46:45.417 --> 46:47.942
She was sitting there at the desk.

46:49.321 --> 46:51.346
Rowan loves to draw.

46:52.024 --> 46:54.959
And swim. You know,
she can swim like some...

46:55.127 --> 46:56.924
Swim. Okay.

46:57.296 --> 47:00.094
So you go out, right? You went out.

47:00.265 --> 47:02.859
Only down to the market.
For no more than a half-hour.

47:03.035 --> 47:05.503
- And you get back, and what?
- And she was gone.

47:06.305 --> 47:08.239
Vanished.

47:08.407 --> 47:12.400
And all her things, her toys,
books, everything, it's like they...

47:12.578 --> 47:14.068
What was she wearing?

47:14.246 --> 47:16.942
A sweater I made her.

47:17.583 --> 47:22.020
The one in the photo. She had that on.

47:22.187 --> 47:24.655
She dresses like every other child
on this island.

47:26.058 --> 47:28.993
- Do you have any other photographs of her?
- No.

47:29.528 --> 47:33.897
We didn't have many.
I mean, with only Dr. Moss taking them.

47:35.234 --> 47:37.202
Dr. Moss?

47:41.774 --> 47:44.902
And you're sure it's no way
it could be someone from off the island?

47:46.245 --> 47:47.269
No.

47:49.081 --> 47:51.049
They're careful about
who they allow here.

47:51.216 --> 47:54.151
Was Rowan depressed at all?

47:54.319 --> 47:57.618
Have you seen what she's drawn
underneath her desk? It's disturbing.

47:57.790 --> 48:00.020
Edward, I know that.

48:08.767 --> 48:09.756
What are you doing?

48:11.303 --> 48:13.567
The plane. I need its radio.

48:13.739 --> 48:15.502
Wait for me.

48:39.498 --> 48:41.329
Hello?

48:44.469 --> 48:46.334
Hello?

48:46.738 --> 48:49.070
Where is this guy?

49:42.294 --> 49:43.625
Rowan?!

49:47.532 --> 49:49.124
Rowan!

50:24.069 --> 50:26.196
Goddamn it!

51:50.355 --> 51:54.451
You're persistent. I'm on my way out,
but perhaps I can help in some way?

51:55.027 --> 51:57.257
I need to ask a couple of questions.

51:57.429 --> 51:58.555
It's quick.

51:58.730 --> 52:00.925
Things are rarely quick.

52:01.099 --> 52:02.327
Come inside, then.

52:02.501 --> 52:04.264
Thank you.

52:09.508 --> 52:11.840
You're T.H. Moss, the photographer.

52:12.010 --> 52:16.071
I'm first a physician,
second a photographer. A distant second.

52:16.515 --> 52:17.982
Did you want your picture taken?

52:19.651 --> 52:22.779
So you take the Harvest Festival
photographs every year?

52:22.954 --> 52:25.388
The ones I saw up at the tavern?

52:25.557 --> 52:28.492
Yes, it's a rather humdrum affair,
I'm afraid.

52:30.695 --> 52:33.687
My mother passed the skill on to me,
as her mother before her.

52:33.865 --> 52:37.733
Your mother. Of course.
Do you have last year's photographs?

52:38.270 --> 52:42.070
- Isn't it there with the others?
- No. No, apparently it got destroyed.

52:42.240 --> 52:43.935
What a pity.

52:45.377 --> 52:46.571
Do you have a copy?

52:46.745 --> 52:50.511
I have the negative. I could have
one printed up for you, if you like.

52:50.682 --> 52:52.877
That'd be great.

52:56.955 --> 52:58.445
Thanks.

53:14.172 --> 53:16.197
It's time, sister.

53:17.042 --> 53:18.976
We must hurry.

53:49.641 --> 53:54.340
<i>"In societies as disparate as ancient Egypt
and pre-Columbian Incan...</i>

53:54.513 --> 53:57.710
<i>...fertility festivals were utilized
in much the same way.</i>

53:58.216 --> 54:01.515
<i>A younger woman was chosen
to personify fertility...</i>

54:01.686 --> 54:04.655
<i>...and then killed in a blood ritual
by the presiding priesthood.</i>

54:04.823 --> 54:09.556
<i>This gesture was thought to guarantee
a successful harvest for the coming year.</i>

54:11.963 --> 54:15.922
<i>In Europe and the Americas, on the
other hand, the offering was often burnt."</i>

54:16.601 --> 54:18.432
Burnt.

54:37.522 --> 54:39.012
Oh, God.

55:17.662 --> 55:19.391
"Rowan Woodward Goddess."

55:22.033 --> 55:24.024
"Worst harvest on record."

55:34.246 --> 55:35.440
Hey.

55:37.749 --> 55:39.046
What the hell is this?

55:43.855 --> 55:47.621
- It's a picture, that's all.
- No, that is not all!

55:49.261 --> 55:53.027
Why didn't you tell me Rowan was a part
of all this, huh? These rituals?

55:54.566 --> 55:55.555
I don't know.

55:55.734 --> 55:58.862
Try, because I'm bouncing around
in circles and I can use some help!

55:59.037 --> 56:02.404
- Edward, why are you yelling at me?
- How about this, for starters:

56:02.574 --> 56:05.042
Our daughter is part
of your worst harvest on record.

56:05.210 --> 56:08.145
You said they blamed her.
Why didn't you tell me about this?

56:08.313 --> 56:11.805
It's just... It's a ceremony that we have.

56:11.983 --> 56:13.507
I don't know anything else.

56:13.685 --> 56:16.449
You live here! You must know something.

56:16.621 --> 56:18.589
You mentioned this ceremony.
Define it!

56:19.357 --> 56:21.951
What is the day of death and rebirth?

56:22.127 --> 56:25.585
It's a story. That's all it is, a story.

56:25.764 --> 56:29.461
I'm trying to trust you, but when I turn
my head, something doesn't make sense.

56:29.634 --> 56:31.795
Well, I'm frightened of this place too.

56:32.570 --> 56:36.870
I was happy to leave here when I did.
Even though I came back...

56:37.042 --> 56:38.168
...I wish I hadn't.

56:38.343 --> 56:40.903
I wish that I stayed
and made a life with you...

56:41.079 --> 56:43.639
...been with you all these years,
but I didn't.

56:43.815 --> 56:46.545
I came back here and had our child,
and now she's...

56:46.718 --> 56:51.178
Okay. All right. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

56:51.356 --> 56:52.823
Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

56:55.727 --> 56:56.921
We'll keep looking.

57:00.103 --> 57:02.003
I'm gonna see this Summersisle lady.

57:02.171 --> 57:04.264
We have to check everything
if we're gonna find Rowan.

57:04.674 --> 57:06.198
If?

57:06.809 --> 57:08.208
If we find her?

57:08.378 --> 57:10.642
No. When. When we find her.

57:45.581 --> 57:48.311
Let me give you a hand.
Want some help?

58:01.831 --> 58:03.526
You okay?

58:05.501 --> 58:06.525
Can't you talk?

01:00:08.691 --> 01:00:10.591
Keep your head down!

01:00:12.628 --> 01:00:16.325
<i>If she existed, we would know of her.
Now, will you please go?</i>

01:00:17.199 --> 01:00:20.259
<i>Rowan Woodward is your classmate,
isn't she?</i>

01:00:20.736 --> 01:00:21.998
<i>Isn't she?</i>

01:00:29.512 --> 01:00:33.107
Had a scare, didn't we?
You've been sleeping for several hours.

01:00:36.152 --> 01:00:37.414
Where am I?

01:00:38.321 --> 01:00:40.653
This is the home of Sister Summersisle.

01:00:40.823 --> 01:00:42.381
Ivy?

01:00:50.199 --> 01:00:51.826
Did you use my kit?

01:00:52.835 --> 01:00:55.326
- The adrenaline shot, or...?
- Oh, no.

01:00:55.504 --> 01:00:56.835
Nothing like that.

01:00:57.006 --> 01:01:00.339
When they brought me to you,
you were near death, clearly.

01:01:00.509 --> 01:01:03.672
So I treated the danger in the old way.

01:01:09.118 --> 01:01:12.986
You are alive. That's what's important.

01:01:18.594 --> 01:01:20.926
I'm here to see Sister Summersisle.

01:01:21.097 --> 01:01:23.258
Yes. She's out front now.

01:01:26.936 --> 01:01:29.496
And she's been expecting you.

01:02:46.515 --> 01:02:48.312
They nearly had you.

01:02:48.484 --> 01:02:50.452
Excuse me?

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:54.212
Our little friends, the bees.

01:02:54.757 --> 01:02:56.054
They almost did you in.

01:02:56.225 --> 01:02:57.749
Yeah.

01:02:58.461 --> 01:02:59.985
Pity.

01:03:00.463 --> 01:03:04.559
Pity, what? They nearly did or didn't?

01:03:09.271 --> 01:03:12.763
Some of our keepers found you,
down near the stables.

01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:14.098
Unconscious.

01:03:14.276 --> 01:03:18.007
Yeah. Beekeepers.
They seem to be everywhere on the island.

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:22.742
Oh, yes. It takes quite a few of them
to keep order around here.

01:03:22.918 --> 01:03:24.715
I'm sure.

01:03:26.422 --> 01:03:29.323
I can tell what she sees in you.

01:03:29.558 --> 01:03:33.153
A kind of rough potential.

01:03:33.329 --> 01:03:35.320
Thanks, I guess.

01:03:35.498 --> 01:03:38.592
So I hear you were expecting me.

01:03:38.801 --> 01:03:40.200
Why's that?

01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:44.005
Just a matter of time
before you came here.

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:47.366
I believe you're looking for a child?

01:03:47.877 --> 01:03:50.038
- I might have found her.
- Excellent.

01:03:50.212 --> 01:03:51.839
Not exactly.

01:03:52.014 --> 01:03:53.038
In a grave.

01:03:53.582 --> 01:03:57.746
And I'd like your permission
to exhume the body, if one exists...

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.717
...and have it removed for an autopsy.

01:04:00.523 --> 01:04:02.787
You suspect foul play?

01:04:02.958 --> 01:04:04.983
Yeah. Murder.

01:04:06.095 --> 01:04:07.824
How perplexing for you.

01:04:09.131 --> 01:04:12.225
In that case, you must carry on.

01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:16.170
You don't seem very concerned.

01:04:16.338 --> 01:04:18.067
No.

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.765
I suppose because I have...

01:04:20.943 --> 01:04:25.039
...confidence that your suspicions
are wrong.

01:04:25.214 --> 01:04:27.148
We don't murder here.

01:04:28.117 --> 01:04:33.054
Yeah. Well, even if a victim complies,
it's still murder.

01:04:33.222 --> 01:04:35.952
Well, perhaps where you come from.

01:04:37.126 --> 01:04:38.821
But we have our own beliefs.

01:04:38.994 --> 01:04:41.394
Right, right, right.

01:04:41.564 --> 01:04:46.524
The festivals. All those offerings.
To whom, exactly?

01:04:48.137 --> 01:04:51.834
To the great Mother Goddess
who rules this island...

01:04:52.007 --> 01:04:55.909
...with me as her earthly representative.

01:04:56.579 --> 01:04:58.137
You?

01:04:58.314 --> 01:05:02.341
I'm the spiritual heart of this colony.

01:05:03.786 --> 01:05:06.755
You honestly encourage
this sort of worship?

01:05:08.591 --> 01:05:13.528
Come on. It's so nice. Let's wander.

01:05:16.332 --> 01:05:19.824
My Celtic ancestors, all the way back...

01:05:20.002 --> 01:05:23.335
...rebelled against the suppression
of the feminine.

01:05:23.505 --> 01:05:30.001
So in the late 17th century,
they fled to the New World.

01:05:30.379 --> 01:05:34.213
Unfortunately, they settled near Salem.

01:05:34.383 --> 01:05:39.082
So when they saw that
the persecution continued, even here...

01:05:39.855 --> 01:05:44.690
...well, that started a long
and painful migration westward.

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:50.594
In the 1850s, my great-great-grandmother
led a group of people here...

01:05:51.533 --> 01:05:56.368
...and vowed never to enter
into that other world again.

01:05:56.572 --> 01:05:58.437
How's that possible? You can't just...

01:05:58.607 --> 01:06:03.044
Oh, those pioneers needed
little urging to isolate.

01:06:03.212 --> 01:06:06.909
They were looking
for a simpler way of life.

01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:10.848
Of course, some do leave,
like our Willow...

01:06:11.654 --> 01:06:14.316
...you know, to test themselves or us.

01:06:14.490 --> 01:06:15.980
Or to find a man.

01:06:16.558 --> 01:06:19.823
But they always come home, eventually.

01:06:20.596 --> 01:06:27.092
- Men are what, second-class citizens?
- No, not at all. We love our men.

01:06:27.403 --> 01:06:30.668
We're just not subservient to them.

01:06:30.839 --> 01:06:34.468
The men are a very important part
of our little colony.

01:06:36.211 --> 01:06:37.974
Breeding, you know.

01:06:39.014 --> 01:06:40.948
God.

01:06:41.116 --> 01:06:45.052
Quite a little racket you've got going
for yourself here. Breeding?

01:06:45.754 --> 01:06:47.813
Sounds like inbreeding to me.

01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:51.187
Please don't criticize
what you know nothing about.

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:55.194
Don't any of you wanna just be
with someone? Fall in love?

01:06:55.364 --> 01:06:59.232
We procreate because
that's the desire of the Goddess.

01:06:59.401 --> 01:07:02.427
To assure ourselves of worthy offspring.

01:07:02.604 --> 01:07:06.404
The strongest, the finest,
the most sturdy of our kind.

01:07:07.443 --> 01:07:09.877
I see. Female, right?

01:07:10.646 --> 01:07:14.810
And what if someone just happens
to have a boy? What do you do then?

01:07:15.584 --> 01:07:16.812
That depends.

01:07:22.858 --> 01:07:26.123
Let me ask you one other thing,
because, frankly, I just don't get you.

01:07:26.295 --> 01:07:27.887
I do not get this place.

01:07:28.063 --> 01:07:30.293
Oh, you will. In time, perhaps.

01:07:30.466 --> 01:07:33.299
Perhaps it is time for you
to stop bullshitting me, okay?

01:07:33.469 --> 01:07:34.458
Now, you be careful.

01:07:34.636 --> 01:07:38.094
Especially when a little girl's life
is at stake. My little girl.

01:07:38.273 --> 01:07:40.138
I'm sure you've guessed.

01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:42.140
As a matter of fact, yes.

01:07:43.345 --> 01:07:46.109
I'm only interested in the law, sister.

01:07:46.281 --> 01:07:50.809
I need to remind you, you are still within
reach of the powers of a normal society.

01:07:50.986 --> 01:07:55.480
So if you wackos practice kidnapping
and ritualized murder, it is my job...

01:07:55.657 --> 01:07:59.252
I believe I've mentioned
our stand on murder.

01:07:59.428 --> 01:08:01.658
Murder is murder.

01:08:01.830 --> 01:08:05.266
Now, do I have permission to open
the grave of Rowan Woodward?

01:08:05.434 --> 01:08:08.460
I was under the impression
I'd already given it to you.

01:08:08.637 --> 01:08:10.332
Your transport.

01:08:10.506 --> 01:08:16.774
Well, it's just been fascinating to converse
with someone from a normal society.

01:08:16.944 --> 01:08:18.606
Till we meet again.

01:09:30.886 --> 01:09:32.786
Rowan?

01:09:35.557 --> 01:09:37.184
Rowan?

01:10:02.518 --> 01:10:04.281
Rowan?

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.918
Rowan?

01:11:01.276 --> 01:11:02.971
Rowan?

01:11:16.458 --> 01:11:18.756
Rowan? Rowan!

01:12:24.826 --> 01:12:26.521
Help!

01:12:27.829 --> 01:12:28.955
Hey!

01:12:35.704 --> 01:12:37.865
Help!

01:12:40.876 --> 01:12:43.242
Help!

01:13:03.899 --> 01:13:08.165
<i>My daughter is what matters
to me now. Rowan.</i>

01:13:15.544 --> 01:13:18.877
<i>I wish that I stayed and made a life
with you, but I didn't.</i>

01:13:19.047 --> 01:13:21.845
<i>I came back here and had our child,
and now she's...</i>

01:13:22.017 --> 01:13:25.043
- Well, who were they?
- Don't know.

01:13:27.122 --> 01:13:28.680
May never know.

01:13:42.704 --> 01:13:44.331
Edward?

01:13:46.942 --> 01:13:48.409
I'm down here.

01:13:48.577 --> 01:13:49.737
Edward?

01:13:49.911 --> 01:13:52.880
Yeah. Somebody shut the lid.

01:13:53.048 --> 01:13:55.642
- I'm coming.
- Oh, God.

01:14:21.777 --> 01:14:25.770
Willow. Look. Look at this.

01:14:26.615 --> 01:14:31.416
She was here. She was down there.
Somebody's keeping her here.

01:14:38.493 --> 01:14:40.484
I wanna show you something else.
Come on.

01:14:48.503 --> 01:14:51.199
This hers? Tell me!

01:14:51.373 --> 01:14:53.364
Yes, I think it... Yeah, but...

01:14:53.542 --> 01:14:55.772
How'd it get burned?
How'd it get burned?!

01:14:55.944 --> 01:14:57.275
How'd it get burned?!

01:14:57.446 --> 01:14:58.970
I don't know!

01:14:59.481 --> 01:15:01.108
- Where are you going?
- To her place.

01:15:01.283 --> 01:15:03.376
- I'm coming with you.
- No, Willow! I mean it.

01:15:03.552 --> 01:15:04.951
But maybe if we...

01:15:05.787 --> 01:15:07.516
Why are you...?

01:15:07.689 --> 01:15:09.520
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:15:09.691 --> 01:15:14.355
Something bad is about to happen.
I can feel it.

01:15:16.798 --> 01:15:19.892
Go to the house and lock yourself in.
I'll come back for you.

01:15:20.902 --> 01:15:22.164
Go! Now!

01:15:40.188 --> 01:15:41.655
Summersisle!

01:15:45.327 --> 01:15:47.090
Summersisle?

01:15:49.564 --> 01:15:51.498
Summersisle!

01:16:01.076 --> 01:16:03.010
Summersisle?

01:16:04.212 --> 01:16:05.702
Summersisle!

01:16:10.218 --> 01:16:12.243
Summersisle!

01:16:27.536 --> 01:16:29.436
Summersisle?

01:16:30.872 --> 01:16:32.669
Summersisle!

01:16:34.409 --> 01:16:36.468
Summersisle!

01:16:47.088 --> 01:16:48.555
He's gone now.

01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:50.858
Excellent.

01:17:07.175 --> 01:17:10.576
- What's with the feathers?
- We're all preparing.

01:17:10.745 --> 01:17:13.145
- For what? A celebration?
- Oh, yes.

01:17:13.315 --> 01:17:16.113
Of death and rebirth.

01:17:16.284 --> 01:17:18.752
Sister Rose, she's only a child.

01:17:19.421 --> 01:17:21.685
You're a teacher.
Think about what you're doing.

01:17:21.856 --> 01:17:25.815
The time for sentiment is over.
The moment has come.

01:17:25.994 --> 01:17:27.359
I won't let her die.

01:17:27.529 --> 01:17:31.329
So gallant, Sir Knight.
Still tilting windmills, I see.

01:17:31.499 --> 01:17:32.932
Right until the end.

01:17:33.101 --> 01:17:34.432
Get off the bike.

01:17:35.770 --> 01:17:37.101
Get off the bike.

01:17:39.641 --> 01:17:41.541
Step away from the bike.

01:17:44.546 --> 01:17:46.480
Take your stupid mask.

01:17:57.525 --> 01:17:58.958
- It is he.
- It is he.

01:18:28.657 --> 01:18:31.421
I need your help. All of you.

01:18:31.593 --> 01:18:33.891
Can't you hear me?
I said I need your help.

01:18:37.766 --> 01:18:39.563
Don't be afraid.

01:18:54.616 --> 01:18:58.074
I'm looking for a missing girl.
Take that mask off your kid.

01:19:01.256 --> 01:19:04.589
You wait a minute! Do you have
permission to charge in and disturb...?

01:19:04.759 --> 01:19:06.886
No! I don't need anybody's
goddamn permission!

01:19:07.595 --> 01:19:10.792
I'm gonna search every inch of this town
and anybody who interferes...

01:19:10.965 --> 01:19:13.229
...will be brought up on murder charges,
got that?

01:19:13.401 --> 01:19:16.768
You have my permission
to stay out of the fucking way!

01:19:37.292 --> 01:19:40.227
Hey! Take those masks off.

01:19:40.395 --> 01:19:42.920
- Hey! Stop it!
- Come here.

01:19:43.098 --> 01:19:45.965
- Go away. Don't.
- Get out.

01:19:51.406 --> 01:19:53.135
Rowan?

01:19:56.377 --> 01:19:57.401
Rowan?

01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:09.848
I trust you won't have to let
your costume out again this year, sister.

01:21:10.018 --> 01:21:14.045
Very soon you'll be
an entire family of bears.

01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:17.924
Oh, I'll manage, Sister Oak.

01:21:18.092 --> 01:21:21.653
It does seem to shrink
a bit each year, however.

01:21:22.630 --> 01:21:26.396
So, sister, did you see
to that business at the harbor?

01:21:26.568 --> 01:21:29.435
Oh, yes. Just as you instructed.

01:21:32.574 --> 01:21:33.768
Now I'll be off.

01:21:35.210 --> 01:21:36.336
Well, well.

01:21:36.911 --> 01:21:40.369
You look a bit worse for wear,
now, don't you?

01:22:12.146 --> 01:22:14.706
O Goddess of the Fields...

01:22:15.383 --> 01:22:19.945
...I bring this humble colony before you
on this day.

01:22:20.121 --> 01:22:22.487
This most sacred of days.

01:22:22.657 --> 01:22:24.887
Please accept our offering.

01:22:25.059 --> 01:22:29.120
Hail, Goddess of the Fields.
Accept our offering.

01:22:29.297 --> 01:22:31.993
That you will once again
in the year to come...

01:22:32.367 --> 01:22:36.963
...bestow on us
the rich and diverse fruits of thy realm.

01:23:11.005 --> 01:23:12.370
God!

01:24:19.874 --> 01:24:22.104
I thought I told you to wait for me.

01:24:22.844 --> 01:24:24.903
What do you mean? I had to come.

01:24:53.841 --> 01:24:55.399
And now...

01:24:55.676 --> 01:24:57.974
...we fulfill our deepest purpose...

01:24:58.713 --> 01:25:01.307
...to balance the forces of dark and light.

01:25:05.253 --> 01:25:06.777
Oh, good God.

01:25:23.504 --> 01:25:25.062
What is it? What's wrong, sister?

01:25:26.541 --> 01:25:27.769
Don't be frightened.

01:25:28.743 --> 01:25:30.438
Go.

01:25:30.611 --> 01:25:32.772
My name is Edward. I'm gonna save you.

01:25:58.639 --> 01:26:00.937
Come on. This way.

01:26:05.246 --> 01:26:06.907
Hurry.

01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:42.508
Wait. Rowan. Rowan, wait. Wait.

01:26:46.654 --> 01:26:49.851
Hello? Hello? Pete! Pete! Help us!

01:26:50.024 --> 01:26:53.824
Help! Please! Please help!

01:27:01.569 --> 01:27:03.503
Come on. Let's go.

01:27:09.076 --> 01:27:13.137
Rowan. Honey. Slow down.

01:27:16.584 --> 01:27:18.575
Rowan, slow down.

01:27:22.557 --> 01:27:25.492
Rowan! Rowan, stop!

01:27:26.594 --> 01:27:28.494
Did I do it right, Mommy? Did I?

01:27:28.663 --> 01:27:29.891
Yes, my love.

01:27:30.064 --> 01:27:31.725
Oh, my little Rowan.

01:27:31.899 --> 01:27:33.560
You did it excellently.

01:27:33.968 --> 01:27:37.028
Don't touch her! Do not touch her!

01:27:37.705 --> 01:27:38.865
Rowan, come back here.

01:27:40.608 --> 01:27:41.700
Welcome, Mr. Malus.

01:27:41.876 --> 01:27:44.071
You have come of your own free will...

01:27:44.245 --> 01:27:46.805
...to keep this appointment
with the Wicker Man.

01:27:46.981 --> 01:27:48.676
Stay back!

01:27:50.751 --> 01:27:52.810
And now the game is over.

01:27:52.987 --> 01:27:55.455
The game of the hunter
leading the hunted.

01:27:55.623 --> 01:27:57.921
You came to find our little Rowan.

01:27:58.092 --> 01:28:01.323
But it is we who have found you,
just as we intended to do.

01:28:01.495 --> 01:28:05.693
I don't understand. Rowan was missing.
I had to come. I had a letter.

01:28:05.866 --> 01:28:07.163
Willow, tell them.

01:28:09.604 --> 01:28:10.969
Willow, please tell them.

01:28:11.973 --> 01:28:14.908
The letter was from all of us here.

01:28:15.509 --> 01:28:16.976
Your invitation to visit...

01:28:18.479 --> 01:28:19.468
...one might say.

01:28:19.647 --> 01:28:22.138
You were just the man we needed.

01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:24.780
And we were determined to get you here.

01:28:24.952 --> 01:28:26.852
Notice how we led you to believe...

01:28:27.021 --> 01:28:32.186
...that your daughter would be sacrificed
due to the failure of the crops last year.

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.123
But they did fail. I saw the photo.

01:28:34.295 --> 01:28:37.890
Yes, they failed, all right.
Disastrously so.

01:28:38.065 --> 01:28:40.932
One of the few times
since my ancestors moved here.

01:28:41.836 --> 01:28:46.500
But we are always prepared
with a powerful sacrifice.

01:28:47.074 --> 01:28:51.135
And that, my friend, is your destiny.

01:28:51.312 --> 01:28:53.371
- It is your destiny.
- Back up!

01:28:54.015 --> 01:28:58.179
What we require is a stranger,
yet one who is connected to us.

01:28:58.352 --> 01:29:00.377
- He's connected to us.
- He's connected to us.

01:29:00.554 --> 01:29:02.317
Connected by blood.

01:29:09.597 --> 01:29:11.224
Willow.

01:29:16.837 --> 01:29:18.998
Why have you done this to me?

01:29:20.775 --> 01:29:23.209
We orchestrated all of this
with the greatest care...

01:29:23.377 --> 01:29:26.073
...everything that's happened.

01:29:26.347 --> 01:29:29.544
Be proud of yourself.
You have done so well.

01:29:29.717 --> 01:29:33.778
Yes. My daughter speaks the truth.

01:29:33.954 --> 01:29:39.984
Your fate was sealed many years ago
when she chose to be with you.

01:29:42.296 --> 01:29:44.161
Your daughter?

01:29:45.032 --> 01:29:47.899
Yes. My Willow.

01:29:48.936 --> 01:29:52.895
This is a story whose chapters
were carefully written.

01:29:58.312 --> 01:30:01.941
You have been chosen
to die a martyr's death.

01:30:02.116 --> 01:30:06.712
You will sit beside the gods and goddesses
for all of eternity.

01:30:07.154 --> 01:30:10.180
Back up! I swear to God, I will shoot you!

01:30:10.591 --> 01:30:14.687
It is a great honor,
one that you cannot refuse.

01:30:15.596 --> 01:30:17.029
It is ordained.

01:30:17.932 --> 01:30:20.457
There is no way out.

01:30:20.634 --> 01:30:22.226
Stay back!

01:31:02.877 --> 01:31:04.242
You bitches!

01:31:06.213 --> 01:31:07.475
You bitches!

01:31:10.651 --> 01:31:13.586
This is murder! Murder!

01:31:13.754 --> 01:31:16.348
You'll all be guilty!

01:31:16.524 --> 01:31:18.719
And you're doing it for nothing!

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:22.158
Killing me won't bring back
your goddamn honey!

01:31:22.329 --> 01:31:23.990
But I know it will.

01:31:28.702 --> 01:31:30.636
Oh, God.

01:31:34.241 --> 01:31:35.435
How can it?

01:31:36.944 --> 01:31:39.572
I'm not one of you!

01:31:41.048 --> 01:31:42.743
I don't believe in your gods!

01:31:43.684 --> 01:31:46.152
I don't believe in sacrifice.

01:31:55.229 --> 01:31:57.424
Oh, God.

01:32:02.069 --> 01:32:04.697
No, don't... Don't move me!

01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.704
What is it? What is it?

01:32:09.076 --> 01:32:11.067
What is that? What is that?
What is it?

01:32:11.812 --> 01:32:15.748
Oh, no. No, not the bees!
Not the bees!

01:32:17.518 --> 01:32:20.954
They're in my eyes! My eyes!

01:32:52.253 --> 01:32:54.687
We'll do it your way this time.

01:32:57.491 --> 01:32:59.959
I must keep you alive.

01:33:42.836 --> 01:33:44.633
Oh, God.

01:33:45.039 --> 01:33:49.271
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:34:07.962 --> 01:34:10.556
O gods and goddesses of nature.

01:34:13.167 --> 01:34:17.627
Receive this sacrifice and be appeased.

01:34:18.372 --> 01:34:21.671
<i>Gods and goddesses of nature.</i>

01:34:21.842 --> 01:34:25.869
<i>Receive this sacrifice and be appeased.</i>

01:35:06.587 --> 01:35:08.418
Rowan.

01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:12.049
No. Rowan!

01:35:14.161 --> 01:35:18.393
No, Rowan, don't! Put it down! No!

01:35:19.433 --> 01:35:20.525
Put it down!

01:35:22.536 --> 01:35:24.163
Rowan!

01:35:24.772 --> 01:35:27.798
Put it down, honey. Put it down.

01:35:36.617 --> 01:35:39.552
Rowan, no! No!

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:42.188
No!

01:35:50.698 --> 01:35:53.929
The drone must die!

01:35:54.101 --> 01:35:56.331
<i>The drone must die!</i>

01:35:56.804 --> 01:35:59.364
<i>The drone must die!</i>

01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:01.269
<i>The drone must die!</i>

01:36:01.442 --> 01:36:03.569
<i>The drone must die!</i>
