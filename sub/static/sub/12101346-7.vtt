WEBVTT

00:42.417 --> 00:43.460
You okay?

00:45.546 --> 00:46.547
Charlie.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.175
Yeah.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.220
I'm okay. Just thinking.

00:55.931 --> 00:56.932
About what?

02:33.195 --> 02:34.196
Yeah, that's good.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.658
Great. We can make s'mores.

02:40.619 --> 02:41.453
Here we go, marshmallows.

02:44.873 --> 02:45.916
Oh, yeah.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.434
-What do you think happened to them?
-The cops?

03:06.019 --> 03:09.731
Nothing. They made it back to Langley
in time for doughnut day.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.026
Someone probably threw them
a ticker-tape parade.

03:13.110 --> 03:16.697
Won all kinds of medals,
commendations, things like that.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.578
Yeah. Beautiful.

03:22.995 --> 03:25.205
I want you to get all this stuff,
all right?

03:25.289 --> 03:27.291
Make sure you pay for the gas too.

03:27.958 --> 03:32.629
Oh, tortillas.
Make sure you find some tortillas.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.860
Hey, is this Hershey?

03:58.030 --> 03:59.489
This is Julian.

04:00.199 --> 04:01.742
We have a mutual friend

04:01.825 --> 04:04.411
who said you might be able
to help me out with something.

04:24.306 --> 04:25.307
<i>Chicos.</i>

04:28.685 --> 04:30.062
Hello, sir.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.779
Can I help?

04:40.155 --> 04:43.075
Sure. I'm looking for my brother-in-law.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.118
I need to tell him

04:45.744 --> 04:47.955
his mama's sick.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.724
He was here three days ago.

05:08.684 --> 05:11.478
He bought a Camper Van.

05:11.562 --> 05:15.232
He have the paperwork
to make that transaction?

05:15.941 --> 05:17.359
Of course.

05:20.028 --> 05:23.699
I don't suppose
you happen to have any details?

05:36.295 --> 05:37.629
Here.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.673
Thanks.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.344
I don't suppose they mentioned
where they were headed?

05:45.596 --> 05:47.973
I heard the kid
say something about a beach.

05:50.184 --> 05:52.853
He didn't happen to mention what beach?

05:52.936 --> 05:53.937
I'm sorry.

05:54.897 --> 05:56.481
Just "the beach."

06:16.168 --> 06:17.544
So...

06:17.628 --> 06:20.422
this is what we're looking for.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.010
Okay.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.512
Let's go to the beach.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.136
...even seaweed as well.

07:08.220 --> 07:12.474
Some down there by the shore. Not--
Not too close. Otherwise, it'll be wet.

07:17.396 --> 07:18.397
Hey.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.481
Anybody home?

07:21.817 --> 07:23.777
Still wanna be in charge
of making the fire?

07:26.071 --> 07:27.072
Sure.

07:32.828 --> 07:38.208
Look, you don't owe those people anything.
All right?

07:40.836 --> 07:43.589
They lied to you. That's brutal.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.010
You don't owe them a thought. Not one.

07:49.261 --> 07:51.221
They were just doing their job.

07:51.305 --> 07:54.474
Well, they have a shitty job.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.729
I don't know. They seemed okay.

08:33.764 --> 08:34.847
Sit down.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.313
Let me tell you how these people work.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.485
They grift you into thinking
that they like you.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.948
'Cause once they've done that,
you feel like you owe them.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.700
You're obligated to them. You understand?

08:54.284 --> 08:58.497
You think they give a shit about you?
It's about control. Controlling you.

08:58.997 --> 09:03.001
The best grifters in the world,
they understand control.

09:03.085 --> 09:08.257
Cops, politicians
and big-ass corporations.

09:10.259 --> 09:13.637
They love you as long as you're buying
the bullshit that they're selling you.

09:15.848 --> 09:18.934
-That's how it works, huh?
-That's how it works.

10:45.270 --> 10:48.440
Pretty good, right? Mexican s'mores?

10:49.525 --> 10:51.109
They're really good, Dad.

11:05.541 --> 11:07.084
Give that to your sister.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.337
What?

11:22.599 --> 11:23.684
So...

11:24.893 --> 11:27.771
tomorrow we're gonna be heading down
to a little beach town.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.023
Pichilingue.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.443
Gonna sell the Scooby-mobile.
We're gonna pick up some supplies.

11:33.527 --> 11:34.695
And then we're...

11:36.196 --> 11:37.656
We're gonna head upriver.

11:41.577 --> 11:44.997
How are we gonna get upriver, you ask?
Well, I'm glad you did.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.625
We're getting a boat.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.047
Come on.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.633
A boat!

11:58.427 --> 12:00.762
It's lovely to live on a raft.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.891
We got the sky up there
all speckled with stars,

12:03.974 --> 12:06.185
and we can lay on our backs
and look up at them.

12:07.019 --> 12:09.104
Discuss whether they were made
or just happened.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.651
-Where's that from?
-<i>Huckleberry Finn.</i>

12:14.735 --> 12:17.738
That's right. <i>Huckleberry Finn.</i>

12:19.698 --> 12:20.866
Who said it?

12:22.576 --> 12:23.744
Dina.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.748
Dina, who said it? Come on. It's easy.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.044
Dina.

12:37.883 --> 12:39.051
What's wrong?

12:43.305 --> 12:44.723
"What's wrong?"

12:46.517 --> 12:51.772
Do you ever think about us?
About what we might want?

12:51.855 --> 12:54.483
Jesus, of course.
You're all I think about.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.653
Sure. As long as we're telling you
that you're the smartest person

12:57.736 --> 13:00.280
in the whole entire universe
every five minutes.

13:00.364 --> 13:01.698
Honey, come on. That's not fair.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.243
If you actually gave a shit,

13:04.326 --> 13:07.287
you would have sent us to go live
with Grandma and Grandpa years ago.

13:07.371 --> 13:09.581
You're better off with your mother and I.

13:09.665 --> 13:11.834
In what world?

13:13.710 --> 13:15.796
Do you know how deranged you sound?

13:18.215 --> 13:21.385
People are dead, Dad.

13:21.927 --> 13:24.054
Actual people are actually dead,

13:24.137 --> 13:27.224
and we're here on the beach
eating fucking Mexican s'mores,

13:27.307 --> 13:28.934
which aren't even a real thing.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.854
And you actually think that's enough
to make it better.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.691
Because you want it to,
and that's how the world works, right?

13:36.859 --> 13:40.237
Except it doesn't work like that.

13:41.196 --> 13:45.993
You just need to control everyone.

13:47.119 --> 13:49.746
I mean,
that's why you make us live like this.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.957
Because if it was any other way,

13:52.040 --> 13:54.793
we would have seen right through you
like everyone else did.

13:55.252 --> 13:57.796
Big genius Allie Fox.

13:58.463 --> 14:04.678
Spends an entire life inventing things
nobody wants and nobody needs.

14:04.761 --> 14:08.891
But it's always them that's wrong.
You know, everyone else is wrong.

14:08.974 --> 14:11.518
Not you. Never you.

14:11.602 --> 14:12.895
-But look at us.
-Shut up!

14:12.978 --> 14:14.563
-Hey.
-Leave him alone.

14:16.064 --> 14:17.357
Hey!

14:17.441 --> 14:18.650
Fuck!

14:30.579 --> 14:32.706
Just sit the fuck down.

15:05.697 --> 15:06.698
Hello.

15:07.199 --> 15:08.033
<i>Hola.</i>

15:08.116 --> 15:11.161
Have you seen an orange Kombi?

15:12.412 --> 15:15.999
I'm looking for my sister and her family.

15:23.006 --> 15:26.051
So... I'm gonna go meet this guy.

15:26.134 --> 15:28.178
Charlie,
I need you to go to the supermarket.

15:28.262 --> 15:30.639
Pick up some rice and beans,
that kind of thing.

15:30.722 --> 15:33.141
Dry. No cans, no jars.

15:33.225 --> 15:34.309
I can do that.

15:34.852 --> 15:36.270
I'll do it.

15:38.647 --> 15:39.773
Hey, wait.

15:41.358 --> 15:42.568
What?

15:44.403 --> 15:46.530
-Go. It's okay. Just be careful.
-What?

15:50.951 --> 15:52.494
Quickly. Fast.

15:58.584 --> 16:00.919
Passed an adventure tourism place
when we came in off--

16:01.003 --> 16:02.504
just off the main strip.

16:02.588 --> 16:04.298
I need you to go pick up
some iodine tablets,

16:04.381 --> 16:06.800
compass, decent map, if they have one.

16:07.801 --> 16:13.640
Some ferro rods,
tarp, paracord, first aid kit.

16:13.724 --> 16:15.017
Yeah.

16:16.768 --> 16:19.855
Oh, flashlight. Best you can find.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.570
Anything else?

16:28.822 --> 16:31.909
Duct tape. Can't have enough duct tape.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.244
I'll be back in a half an hour.

16:43.504 --> 16:45.547
So, did you see this place?

16:46.298 --> 16:47.549
What place?

16:47.633 --> 16:49.259
The adventure shop or whatever.

16:51.220 --> 16:52.804
The place with the stuff.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.266
I didn't even see it.

16:57.809 --> 17:00.229
We're not going to the adventure place.

17:02.356 --> 17:04.358
We're finding Charlie and going home.

17:07.486 --> 17:10.071
Wait, what? Home where?

17:11.156 --> 17:12.156
Home.

17:16.578 --> 17:17.871
What about Dad?

17:49.486 --> 17:50.696
You Hershey?

17:59.872 --> 18:00.873
Julian?

18:04.543 --> 18:05.586
Bring it in, man.

18:09.173 --> 18:10.382
It's nice to meet you, man.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.595
You don't look like a Julian.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.472
Have to take that up with my mother.

18:26.982 --> 18:28.150
That one right here.

18:51.632 --> 18:54.134
She's certainly got some miles on her.

18:54.218 --> 18:57.596
Yeah, super reliable though.
Or your money back.

18:58.222 --> 18:59.431
So what are you asking for her?

18:59.515 --> 19:02.434
Fifteen thousand. US. Obviously.

19:04.353 --> 19:06.396
Feel like I could get
one of these for eight.

19:07.231 --> 19:08.774
Six, the condition she's in.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.317
Yeah. Yeah, you could.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.946
I'm guessing it's a seller's market
kind of deal, you know?

19:15.656 --> 19:17.282
I don't wanna be that guy,

19:17.366 --> 19:20.410
but the crazy thing about it is
I actually am that guy.

19:20.494 --> 19:23.747
At some point along the way,
I just got turned onto the whole...

19:23.830 --> 19:24.998
supply-and-demand of it.

19:25.082 --> 19:26.834
That seems to happen, doesn't it?

19:26.917 --> 19:28.710
It's like hemorrhoids.

19:28.794 --> 19:31.088
Everyone gets 'em
if you're around long enough.

19:46.645 --> 19:47.938
<i>Gracias, señor.</i>

19:51.900 --> 19:53.569
Anything else I can help you with?

19:54.278 --> 19:57.072
-What do you mean?
-I don't know. Personal defense maybe.

20:01.076 --> 20:02.411
You mean guns?

20:02.494 --> 20:03.787
Sure.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.708
No. I don't need any guns.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.627
Nobody does... till they do.

20:11.837 --> 20:15.299
Anybody who needs a gun
has already lost the argument, my friend.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.427
Eye for an eye
makes the whole world blind.

20:19.094 --> 20:20.762
Unless you get both eyes first.

20:24.099 --> 20:26.226
Let's get you the fuck off my boat.

20:30.814 --> 20:32.691
Hi, do you speak English?

20:34.943 --> 20:36.570
Someone has to speak English.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.990
-Excuse me, do you speak English?
-Yes, I do.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.867
Okay, I'm looking for a boy.
He's, like, this high.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.119
He's got a red T-shirt on.

20:44.203 --> 20:45.871
-A backpack...
-No.

20:45.954 --> 20:47.414
-Have you seen a kid walking alone?
-No.

20:50.959 --> 20:51.960
<i>Gracias.</i>

22:59.880 --> 23:01.173
Leave us alone.

23:07.679 --> 23:08.972
Don't send that picture.

23:10.224 --> 23:15.562
I got a buddy who collects these things.
VW campers. Is it yours?

23:18.273 --> 23:20.317
Just go away and leave us alone.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.194
No problem.

23:24.613 --> 23:26.073
Put the phone down.

23:27.950 --> 23:29.243
Put it down!

23:31.078 --> 23:32.371
Why, though?

23:33.121 --> 23:36.834
Just put it down. Please.

23:44.383 --> 23:45.384
Please.

24:39.479 --> 24:40.314
Hey.

25:39.873 --> 25:40.999
No, Mom.

25:48.090 --> 25:50.342
Turn around. Turn around. Go. Go.

26:33.051 --> 26:34.136
What do we know?

26:35.470 --> 26:37.264
We're reaching out to the local captains,

26:37.347 --> 26:39.892
but no one seems to know who this guy was.

26:40.559 --> 26:43.061
It doesn't feel like local trouble.

26:44.771 --> 26:49.109
Then we need to get this kid's details
to the U.S. Consulate.

27:15.511 --> 27:18.013
<i>Kid fucking shot me.</i>

27:18.430 --> 27:20.015
<i>Cops got him.</i>

27:20.682 --> 27:22.768
<i>They're in Pichilingue.</i>

27:41.119 --> 27:43.664
So, do you have a name?

27:47.000 --> 27:50.170
Is there anyone I can call
to come help you?

27:54.174 --> 27:58.929
Please understand, you've committed
a very serious offense in my town.

28:01.431 --> 28:04.893
But I want to help you. That's my job.

28:06.979 --> 28:09.481
But if you don't help me to do that job...

28:19.825 --> 28:21.201
My daughter gave me this.

28:23.704 --> 28:25.122
She like dolphins.

28:29.626 --> 28:30.627
Do you?

28:35.382 --> 28:36.425
No.

28:38.844 --> 28:41.513
Dolphins kill baby porpoises.

28:42.931 --> 28:45.726
They beat them to death,
break their bones.

28:47.311 --> 28:50.105
Poor porpoises don't even compete
for their food, but...

28:51.648 --> 28:53.650
dolphins just do it for fun.

28:54.484 --> 28:58.363
Nobody cares because
dolphins are super intelligent.

28:58.864 --> 29:00.866
They always look like they're happy.

29:03.452 --> 29:05.120
Dolphins are assholes.

29:12.377 --> 29:14.379
Shot him with what, his finger?

29:14.463 --> 29:16.965
Who cares?
How long do you think it's gonna be

29:17.049 --> 29:20.010
before Aunt Lucrecia finds out
that Charlie's in there?

29:20.093 --> 29:22.387
Because that's who he shot,
right, one of hers?

29:23.514 --> 29:25.516
We need to get on the phone

29:25.599 --> 29:28.852
and turn ourselves in
to US authorities right now.

29:28.936 --> 29:31.688
Cut a deal. Get Charlie out now.

29:32.523 --> 29:35.651
He can be on the plane
and in the States by tomorrow.

29:36.818 --> 29:39.321
He and Dina can go live with Mom and Dad.

29:40.239 --> 29:42.533
Well, that is absolutely not gonna happen.

29:43.575 --> 29:45.452
-Dad.
-Yes, it is.

29:47.412 --> 29:50.749
This is my choice to make.
This is my fault.

29:51.834 --> 29:55.170
You don't get a say
in how I choose to put it right.

29:57.339 --> 29:59.174
That's my decision.

30:00.551 --> 30:01.885
No.

30:03.303 --> 30:04.847
This is nobody's fault.

30:06.557 --> 30:09.768
There's no deal to cut.
There's no America.

30:10.602 --> 30:13.313
It's just us.
We don't just throw that away.

30:15.399 --> 30:16.775
We fix it.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.990
Things can be fucking fixed.

30:26.952 --> 30:27.953
Mom.

30:30.163 --> 30:33.917
Mom, what did you mean?
How is this your fault?

30:36.670 --> 30:37.671
Not now.

31:50.410 --> 31:52.746
We could break in through the roof maybe.

31:52.829 --> 31:55.541
Yeah,
except there's cops inside with guns.

31:58.085 --> 31:59.670
Could set it on fire.

32:02.214 --> 32:03.674
They'd have to evacuate, right?

32:05.175 --> 32:07.010
Yeah,
except if you build the fire too small,

32:07.094 --> 32:08.887
they just come and they put it out.

32:08.971 --> 32:13.141
Build a fire too big, get a cell block
full of crispy critters.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.938
Fire's a bastard.

32:23.318 --> 32:26.530
Steal a truck.
Drive it straight through the walls.

32:28.448 --> 32:30.200
It's kinda your go-to move, isn't it?

32:32.202 --> 32:33.203
It could work.

32:33.287 --> 32:35.205
Yeah,
except you still have cops with guns.

32:35.289 --> 32:37.165
And then you got whiplash.

32:37.249 --> 32:40.460
It's a good idea though.
Keep thinking about it. Roll 'em over.

32:48.010 --> 32:49.386
What are you doing?

32:51.972 --> 32:52.973
Listening.

32:54.725 --> 32:55.726
To what?

32:57.436 --> 32:58.770
The ocean.

33:02.649 --> 33:03.775
Why?

33:04.526 --> 33:05.736
It's relaxing.

33:55.661 --> 33:56.912
Hold that.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.280
It's a storm drain.
Goes right to the jail.

34:34.157 --> 34:37.159
Gonna need a FuBar and some glow sticks.

34:38.996 --> 34:39.996
A what?

35:09.359 --> 35:12.196
By nightfall, there's only
gonna be one cop in that jail.

35:13.864 --> 35:16.283
The rest are gonna be
patrolling the bars, clubs.

35:16.366 --> 35:18.744
You know, all the tourists
who can't hold their tequila.

35:19.620 --> 35:22.706
All we gotta do, lure that one guy out,

35:22.789 --> 35:24.499
keep the others away from the jail.

35:25.542 --> 35:26.543
That's it.

35:28.128 --> 35:29.630
Everybody know what they're doing?

35:31.048 --> 35:32.049
Yeah.

35:32.466 --> 35:33.759
All right. Good.

35:34.635 --> 35:36.512
-Who gets hurt?
-No one.

35:36.595 --> 35:39.181
That's right. No one gets hurt.

39:59.066 --> 40:02.236
The cops'll be holding the kid
in the local drunk tank.

40:03.070 --> 40:04.821
I'll swing by and pick him up.

40:04.905 --> 40:07.908
Once we got the kid,
we as good as got the parents.

40:08.659 --> 40:12.371
No, Isaias is gone. He bled out.

40:12.996 --> 40:16.875
Oh, I surely will. I'll shoot
that little asshole in the asshole.

40:16.959 --> 40:18.794
See how he likes them apples.

40:19.336 --> 40:21.213
I'll be there momentarily.

40:52.911 --> 40:54.204
So what are you gonna do?

40:54.997 --> 40:57.332
Make sure the coast is clear,
then book it.

40:57.416 --> 40:59.209
-How fast?
-As fast as I can.

40:59.835 --> 41:00.836
Faster.

41:03.005 --> 41:05.465
If anybody comes around--
They won't, but if they do?

41:06.133 --> 41:07.259
Tell them to run.

41:11.346 --> 41:12.264
All right.

41:13.223 --> 41:14.516
You okay?

41:16.643 --> 41:17.644
Here.

41:25.736 --> 41:26.737
Go.

41:51.595 --> 41:52.596
Ready?

41:57.643 --> 41:59.811
-Fuck. Oh, God.
-Fuck.

41:59.895 --> 42:01.021
Oh, fuck.

42:02.231 --> 42:03.273
Oh, God, that's good.

42:05.108 --> 42:06.860
-I think you broke it.
-Yeah.

42:07.277 --> 42:09.905
-How do I look?
-Oh, it looks good.

42:09.988 --> 42:13.742
All right, give me a minute
to get in there and then do it.

42:14.660 --> 42:16.370
No matter what happens.

42:38.016 --> 42:41.311
I need help. I got mugged.

42:45.524 --> 42:46.900
-Do you speak English?
-Yeah.

42:47.860 --> 42:48.986
I got robbed.

42:49.361 --> 42:51.280
Mugged. Big guys.
Canadian, I don't know.

42:51.363 --> 42:54.324
-Please sit down.
-All wearing rugby shirts and shorts.

43:19.183 --> 43:21.435
-Where?
-They took my money, took my passport.

43:21.518 --> 43:24.271
-Where?
-Just around the corner there.

43:25.355 --> 43:26.356
Down the street.

43:57.095 --> 43:59.014
-Stay there. Stay there!
-Yeah, yeah.

44:08.690 --> 44:09.733
<i>Señor, señor, señor.</i>

44:10.317 --> 44:12.778
You got a kid in there,
about yea high, name of Charlie?

44:12.861 --> 44:15.656
-'Cause I need to see him real quick.
-Are you his father?

44:35.926 --> 44:39.137
See that shit?
Yeah, that'll be the boy's daddy.

44:39.221 --> 44:43.100
Now, I need to get to that young man
before his daddy does.

44:48.313 --> 44:50.440
I know, <i>tranquilo.</i>
You turn around now. Turn around.

44:50.524 --> 44:52.317
What's it gonna be? What's it gonna be?

45:11.670 --> 45:12.713
Cuff him.

45:25.851 --> 45:26.852
Come on!

45:48.832 --> 45:51.627
You just locked yourself in a jail,
genius.

45:52.878 --> 45:54.755
Yeah, I did.

45:57.674 --> 46:00.511
Are you gonna do us all a favor
and get your ass out here?

46:00.594 --> 46:03.722
I mean, you're not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.

46:04.389 --> 46:05.390
Uh-huh.

46:06.016 --> 46:08.977
I got my boss on the way.
I wanna make her happy.

46:10.771 --> 46:13.148
All right, have it your own way.

46:19.821 --> 46:20.989
Dad.

46:33.752 --> 46:34.586
-You okay?
-Yeah.

46:35.128 --> 46:35.963
Come on.

46:47.558 --> 46:48.559
Now!

47:34.104 --> 47:35.105
See this stuff?

47:36.732 --> 47:39.693
Trash the place.
Make a mess. Throw it everywhere.

47:45.032 --> 47:46.491
Messier! More!

48:35.666 --> 48:38.502
We gotta go down there.
You gotta go first, you understand?

48:48.428 --> 48:50.931
Count to three, and I'll be there in four.

48:52.474 --> 48:53.892
Go. Go on.

48:53.976 --> 48:55.018
Go.

49:14.788 --> 49:15.747
Dad?

49:24.506 --> 49:25.507
Dad.

49:31.513 --> 49:32.764
-You okay?
-Yeah.

49:51.700 --> 49:53.327
-You okay?
-Yeah.

50:14.806 --> 50:15.891
Dad.

50:17.643 --> 50:20.187
Sorry, I-- Sorry.

50:20.854 --> 50:21.855
Hey.

50:22.481 --> 50:23.524
Come here.

50:27.110 --> 50:28.529
This is gonna be easy.

50:29.488 --> 50:30.822
-No. No.
-It is.

50:31.532 --> 50:35.285
You can do this. You understand?
You have to do this.

50:37.538 --> 50:39.540
I'll be right on the other side, waiting.

50:57.349 --> 50:58.350
Yeah.

50:59.685 --> 51:01.562
See? It's a piece of a cake.

51:02.896 --> 51:03.897
I can't do it.

51:05.691 --> 51:08.235
-You can do this.
-Dad, I can't.

51:08.318 --> 51:09.444
Charlie.

51:10.612 --> 51:11.613
I can't.

51:12.030 --> 51:13.031
Yes, you can.

51:13.407 --> 51:15.909
Charlie! Charlie!

51:16.702 --> 51:19.329
-Charlie, you can do it.
-Dad, I can't!

51:19.413 --> 51:21.832
Charlie, right now. Now!

51:24.418 --> 51:25.419
Do it now!

51:53.864 --> 51:57.993
-I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. Dad.
-What?

51:58.076 --> 52:03.123
No. Come here.
Hey. No, no, no. I love you.

52:03.207 --> 52:05.292
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

52:07.044 --> 52:08.921
You don't ever need to apologize to me.

52:09.004 --> 52:10.255
Okay? Ever.

52:10.923 --> 52:11.924
Okay.

52:44.039 --> 52:45.374
Go. Go!

53:35.757 --> 53:39.887
