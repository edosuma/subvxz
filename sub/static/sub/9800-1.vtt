00:35.921 --> 00:37.662
Cute and cuddly, boys.

00:58.880 --> 00:59.975
Intruder alert!

01:03.295 --> 01:04.313
Hello, neighbor.

01:04.971 --> 01:07.650
Those snack provisions
are for authorized personnel only.

01:07.984 --> 01:10.584
Do not worry.
It is only I, King Julien,

01:10.709 --> 01:13.280
who's borrowing your delicious food
for my stomach.

01:13.564 --> 01:14.958
Yes, that is it.

01:15.556 --> 01:16.763
"Borrowing".

01:20.450 --> 01:21.820
And kick, punch,

01:21.945 --> 01:25.405
chop, mulch, duck, spin, backflip,
twirl, bob and weave,

01:25.903 --> 01:28.413
weave and bob, plie, punch, kick,

01:28.734 --> 01:29.714
and...

01:29.882 --> 01:30.775
punch.

01:33.887 --> 01:35.594
Hello, neighbor.

01:36.878 --> 01:37.612
Fore!

01:40.601 --> 01:41.708
It is okay.

01:41.833 --> 01:44.562
I have 400 more golf balls
where that came from.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.522
I like golf.

01:47.573 --> 01:49.465
I like flying.

01:52.241 --> 01:54.504
I don't like drowning.

02:02.408 --> 02:04.003
Look out. Coming through.

02:04.488 --> 02:05.583
What the...

02:05.751 --> 02:07.752
Hello. You've run out of juice.

02:09.406 --> 02:10.503
Hello, neighbor.

02:10.672 --> 02:11.858
What are you do...

02:12.767 --> 02:14.751
But this is our home, our HQ,

02:15.000 --> 02:16.969
our inner sanctum.
You can't just...

02:17.264 --> 02:18.830
I can't hear you.

02:18.955 --> 02:20.765
Television too loud.

02:33.050 --> 02:35.366
Gentlemen, we need a vacation.

02:35.639 --> 02:38.199
Vacation from that lemur.
- We could visit a zoo.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.868
They have pandas and hippos
and lovely house of reptiles.

02:41.674 --> 02:44.162
Private,
you do know we live in a zoo.

02:44.490 --> 02:46.165
But we could visit a different zoo.

02:49.246 --> 02:51.295
Kowalski,
calculate the furthest trip possible

02:51.463 --> 02:52.755
from our present location.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.166
Climate?
- Unspecified.

02:54.291 --> 02:55.592
Elevation?
- Unimportant.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.385
Lemur population?
- 0.0%

02:58.553 --> 03:01.430
I've come up with two locations
that fit our vacation parameters.

03:03.015 --> 03:05.142
I can't set foot in Denmark.
- Why not?

03:05.310 --> 03:08.938
That's private, Private,
between me and the danes.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.690
Very well, that leaves one location.

03:13.503 --> 03:16.612
Gentlemen, we are going to the Moon.

03:20.107 --> 03:22.692
And no, there's no zoo on the Moon.

03:33.180 --> 03:36.168
We'll never get to the Moon
at this rate. Let's pick up the pace.

03:37.973 --> 03:41.011
<i>Men, I present to you the Penguin 1.</i>

03:41.397 --> 03:43.229
Is it safe, Skipper?

03:45.484 --> 03:47.309
Technically speaking, maybe.

03:47.638 --> 03:49.144
Say goodbye to earth, boys.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.752
But, Skipper,
earth has some of my favorite things,

03:51.877 --> 03:53.744
like cookies and oxygen...

03:53.869 --> 03:55.889
And brown paper packages
tied up with string.

03:56.014 --> 03:57.361
Kowalski, light this candle.

03:57.529 --> 03:58.904
T minus five...

03:59.072 --> 03:59.989
Four...

04:00.157 --> 04:02.700
Three... Two... One...

04:02.868 --> 04:03.880
Ignition.

04:12.589 --> 04:13.690
Yo, Max,

04:14.046 --> 04:16.630
do I look a little,
I don't know, chunkier to you?

04:16.798 --> 04:20.175
I mean, I been exercising and all,
but no matter how I try,

04:20.586 --> 04:23.012
I can't get rid of all this
succulent,

04:23.312 --> 04:25.875
delicious, dark meat.

04:30.935 --> 04:33.814
Just give it up, hairball.
You've never caught a bird in your life.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.762
Never have, never will.

04:42.079 --> 04:43.699
A shooting star.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.520
I wish...

04:45.930 --> 04:48.948
I wish for a bird
that can't fly away.

04:49.711 --> 04:50.497
And...

04:50.665 --> 04:53.241
I also wish the shooting star
doesn't hit me.

05:02.682 --> 05:03.510
Hello!

05:04.117 --> 05:05.255
Neighbors?

05:05.941 --> 05:08.005
I would like to borrow
your toothbrushes

05:08.130 --> 05:10.643
to scrub my hard-to-reach regions.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.643
If you agree, say nothing at all.

05:14.781 --> 05:16.126
I guess they agree.

05:16.858 --> 05:19.250
This is an once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

05:19.812 --> 05:21.278
As long as we are borrowing,

05:21.560 --> 05:23.113
how about a little television?

05:23.281 --> 05:26.033
You mean big television,
big and heavy.

05:26.867 --> 05:29.089
Good point.
Let me think. Okay!

05:29.214 --> 05:31.339
My brain is saying that the king,
which is me,

05:31.464 --> 05:33.408
should not have
to lift heavy things.

05:35.287 --> 05:37.252
I like heavy lifting.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.033
Welcome to the Moon, boys.

05:43.158 --> 05:46.887
Lemur population, zip, zero, nada.
Beautiful.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.264
Oxygen reading's surprisingly high.

05:49.845 --> 05:52.859
Moon cheese content:
disappointingly low.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.563
Private, claim this rock
in the name of...

05:56.731 --> 05:57.606
Penguins?

05:57.774 --> 06:00.204
How did penguins get up here,
when they...

06:01.071 --> 06:02.150
can't fly.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.655
Thank you!

06:06.236 --> 06:08.520
I'm picking up
a possible alien life-form.

06:09.055 --> 06:10.035
Game on, boys.

06:10.309 --> 06:11.996
Disperse and investigate.

06:16.987 --> 06:17.987
Hello?

06:18.358 --> 06:19.379
Aliens?

06:26.668 --> 06:28.989
A Moon rock!
It's just a baseball.

06:29.415 --> 06:31.355
That flew all the way to the Moon!

06:34.706 --> 06:35.415
Hello.

06:37.248 --> 06:39.815
Greetings, my little friend.

06:40.082 --> 06:41.158
Excuse me,

06:42.306 --> 06:44.499
are you a penguin?

06:44.624 --> 06:46.154
Why? Yes, I am.

06:46.279 --> 06:47.721
A flightless bird?

06:47.846 --> 06:50.449
That means no flapping, no flying,

06:50.722 --> 06:52.149
no resistance.

06:55.830 --> 06:59.043
Kudos, Private.
You've discovered an alien life-form.

06:59.970 --> 07:01.065
A buffet!

07:03.525 --> 07:06.288
Skipper, this alien is
oddly catlike in structure.

07:06.413 --> 07:07.464
A Moon cat?

07:08.918 --> 07:10.187
Moon cat?

07:10.513 --> 07:12.184
Greetings, Moon cat.

07:12.436 --> 07:13.886
We come in peace...

07:14.341 --> 07:15.100
for now.

07:15.559 --> 07:19.229
You really think
that you're on the Moon.

07:19.398 --> 07:20.857
Affirmative.
- Well,

07:21.478 --> 07:22.817
good, because

07:23.027 --> 07:23.875
you are.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.187
Definitely.
You're on the Moon.

07:26.685 --> 07:27.535
Welcome

07:28.043 --> 07:29.617
to... the Moon.

07:31.886 --> 07:33.285
They spotted the crash!

07:33.715 --> 07:36.687
They want to take you away.
- Who exactly is "they"?

07:37.989 --> 07:39.625
The evil Moon warriors.

07:39.944 --> 07:41.141
We can take 'em.

07:42.597 --> 07:45.147
But that beam is their death ray.

07:45.493 --> 07:47.691
Death ray? Bring it on!

07:48.022 --> 07:48.740
Look,

07:48.865 --> 07:51.382
I refuse to let anything happen
to you guys.

07:51.507 --> 07:53.118
You're coming with me.

07:53.586 --> 07:55.516
And to think, he just met us.

07:59.123 --> 08:00.062
Poor Mort.

08:00.463 --> 08:02.615
Here, let me help you.

08:03.314 --> 08:05.001
Lift with your legs!

08:05.263 --> 08:07.277
Your tiny, tiny legs!

08:07.445 --> 08:08.365
Your Majesty,

08:08.490 --> 08:11.073
I thought for sure the penguins
would have this place booby trapped.

08:18.008 --> 08:21.208
Mort, I am starting to think
you're not taking this job seriously.

08:26.324 --> 08:27.867
Maurice!
- Hang on.

08:37.583 --> 08:38.534
Moon cat,

08:39.080 --> 08:41.556
I'm touched by your hospitality.

08:43.441 --> 08:45.256
Well, it's time to eat!

08:46.484 --> 08:48.116
And now he's making us a meal.

08:48.300 --> 08:49.903
You, sir, are a model of kindness.

08:53.094 --> 08:55.177
Do you hear that?
They're coming.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.785
You better use my
teleportation machine to hide.

08:58.074 --> 09:00.497
Teleportation?
That's pure science fiction.

09:00.862 --> 09:03.650
Which is exactly
why I've had to disguise it

09:03.775 --> 09:05.522
as a microwave oven.

09:05.647 --> 09:07.484
It's top secret.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.298
Camouflage?
Well-played.

09:16.751 --> 09:18.266
It's a bit of a squeeze.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.766
Maybe if you took off the helmet.

09:21.139 --> 09:23.720
This Moon cat has opened
his home, his heart, and

09:23.845 --> 09:25.538
his top secret technology to us.

09:26.191 --> 09:29.005
Ten four on that.
He's downright neighborly.

09:29.789 --> 09:30.986
Hello, neighbor.

09:31.310 --> 09:33.155
Hello, neighbor.
Hello, neighbor.

09:37.251 --> 09:39.634
Kowalski, maybe I need to sign on

09:39.759 --> 09:41.787
to Moon cat's good neighbor policy.

09:43.547 --> 09:44.833
Forget the microwave!

09:45.118 --> 09:47.252
You mean teleportation device?
- Whatever.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.670
No more fooling around.

09:49.382 --> 09:50.505
It's time...

09:50.748 --> 09:52.320
Moon cat is so right.

09:52.445 --> 09:55.272
We can't fool around on the Moon
any longer. It is time...

09:55.397 --> 09:56.654
time to go home.

09:57.436 --> 09:58.602
Wait. What?

10:01.972 --> 10:03.910
Thanks for everything, Moon cat.

10:04.138 --> 10:05.319
Rico, gift him.

10:07.804 --> 10:08.607
Food?

10:09.067 --> 10:09.816
For me?

10:12.526 --> 10:15.900
No one's ever, ever
given me a gift before.

10:18.399 --> 10:19.117
Sorry.

10:19.451 --> 10:20.869
You're quite welcome.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.580
T minus five, four,

10:24.265 --> 10:24.974
three,

10:25.333 --> 10:26.042
two,

10:26.829 --> 10:27.538
one,

10:28.237 --> 10:29.044
Ignition.

10:33.395 --> 10:34.758
Kowalski, status report.

10:34.926 --> 10:37.088
I am randomly pushing buttons

10:37.213 --> 10:39.645
while we spin out of control, skipper.
- Can I push one?

10:39.770 --> 10:40.912
I'd feel better.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.311
Prepare for splashdown.

10:52.275 --> 10:54.152
Or crash down, as it were.

10:59.138 --> 11:01.201
Hello, trap-happy penguins.

11:01.370 --> 11:02.176
We were

11:02.501 --> 11:04.360
just borrowing your...

11:05.123 --> 11:06.622
It was Mort's idea.

11:07.237 --> 11:09.167
Not to worry,
my ringtailed neighbor.

11:09.335 --> 11:13.171
I've had a little attitude adjustment,
thanks to my visit up there.

11:16.523 --> 11:17.718
Thanks for the fish!

11:19.704 --> 11:22.347
So we didn't go lunar?

11:22.721 --> 11:24.374
It seems I forgot to carry the two.

11:24.499 --> 11:27.693
And there's no such thing
as Moon cat hospitality?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.357
Looks like we have intruders, boys.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.526
Commence operation hammerhead.

11:34.921 --> 11:36.653
Excuse me,
hammer whose head exactly?
