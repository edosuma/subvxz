WEBVTT

00:50.708 --> 00:52.249
Wait.

01:13.708 --> 01:15.707
I can't see the money.

01:15.958 --> 01:17.707
And I can't see the truck.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.332
Maybe you'll see it

01:19.541 --> 01:22.499
once I find out who you are.

01:23.416 --> 01:27.582
Don't you have real Russians anymore?

01:27.916 --> 01:29.915
Only wogs and Poles?

01:30.416 --> 01:32.707
I've got six-hundred thousand bucks.

01:33.041 --> 01:34.540
Does it matter where I was born?

01:35.291 --> 01:37.499
I don't believe foreigners.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.957
- As you wish.
- Wait.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.957
If you're not Russian,
then maybe you're not a bandit either.

01:48.166 --> 01:50.165
Maybe you're not a bandit as well.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.999
I can see the uniform,
but I don't know who is underneath.

01:55.291 --> 02:00.082
There's a way to find out who we are.

02:01.416 --> 02:02.999
Easy!

02:25.416 --> 02:27.415
Choose one.

02:27.708 --> 02:29.707
- What for?
- You'll see

02:29.916 --> 02:34.332
how real Russians prove
they're not moles.

02:49.958 --> 02:53.707
If you blow your head off,
I won't get my stuff.

02:53.750 --> 02:56.790
But you'll see
that you're not dealing with a rat.

03:07.291 --> 03:11.082
- Do you know a cop that would do it?
- No.

03:11.208 --> 03:12.540
Me neither.

03:15.666 --> 03:17.374
Have you done it before?

03:17.791 --> 03:19.582
Four times.

03:19.791 --> 03:21.457
I never have.

03:38.791 --> 03:40.790
You thought they were blanks, huh?

03:48.250 --> 03:51.582
- Let's drink, Pole.
- Let's drink.

03:55.125 --> 03:56.749
I'm nauseous.

03:58.291 --> 04:00.290
Couldn't we do it later?

04:00.458 --> 04:03.457
7am is already late for this guy.

04:03.958 --> 04:08.040
But there's no road here.
How will I drive our kid to the kindergarten?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.249
It'll have been built
by the time you give birth.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.207
It's here.

04:27.791 --> 04:29.790
It's shit, not a plot.

04:30.125 --> 04:32.457
There's nothing here but snow.

04:33.416 --> 04:36.915
Junior has the layouts
of the house and the pond.

04:36.958 --> 04:38.624
Junior, show us.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.957
Firearms, grenades, explosives,
fuses and means of communication.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.207
- All for you.
- I'll take everything.

05:43.500 --> 05:46.665
Take it.
Count it if you want.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.957
FSB! Freeze, bitch!
Get down!

05:57.875 --> 06:04.040
Put your hands on your head!
Come on! Good boy!

06:23.708 --> 06:25.707
Wake up!

06:26.875 --> 06:29.124
Come on!
It's late!

06:29.416 --> 06:31.415
What's going on?

06:31.916 --> 06:35.374
- Can't you sleep?
- Aren't you going to work today?

06:35.791 --> 06:38.207
Sure I am.

06:39.583 --> 06:41.415
Fuck, my boss is going to kill me!

06:41.458 --> 06:46.415
- I'll wash your mouth with yellow soap!
- I love you, grandma.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.790
Look.

07:00.458 --> 07:02.499
You won't get clobbered
by Wołomin motherfuckers.

07:02.583 --> 07:04.040
You'll be swindled by cocksuckers.

07:04.583 --> 07:07.040
You should write pop songs,
you're wasting your talent.

07:10.833 --> 07:14.624
Now, when I'm free, white and rich,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.332
I'm entitled to a bit of happiness.

07:26.166 --> 07:28.165
Park it properly.

07:41.791 --> 07:44.957
The sleeping princess deigned to come?

07:45.416 --> 07:47.040
Good morning.

07:47.125 --> 07:50.415
Stop showing off.
Ulka's been waiting your tables.

07:50.583 --> 07:53.082
You're paying her
because I'm not going to.

07:53.375 --> 07:57.040
Don't you worry, boss.
We'll settle with each other.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.124
Where to, you fat pig?

08:03.208 --> 08:06.540
- To the loo.
- You'll go when I let you.

08:06.666 --> 08:10.332
Now move your ass
and help the Russki wash dishes.

08:11.791 --> 08:14.082
Good morning, what can I get you?

08:17.416 --> 08:20.790
- Latte and sparkling water.
- Thank you, I'll be right back.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.124
What the fuck are you doing?

08:24.250 --> 08:25.790
The tableware cost me two hundred!

08:25.833 --> 08:31.165
- Clean this up, you dumb-ass!
- Calmed down a little?

08:31.791 --> 08:35.499
Get the fuck out on the street!

08:35.707 --> 08:37.332
Fuck!

08:52.666 --> 08:54.040
Fucking...

08:56.083 --> 08:57.707
Coffee?

08:58.208 --> 08:59.999
I'm not in the mood, mate.

09:04.083 --> 09:06.040
I know a good place.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.707
Better than this crap?

09:30.583 --> 09:33.374
So what's so special about this place?

09:34.958 --> 09:36.707
It's all mine.

09:37.083 --> 09:39.999
I have a straw owner, but it's mine.

09:41.708 --> 09:43.290
And?

09:45.125 --> 09:46.540
And?

09:47.541 --> 09:49.540
It can be ours.

09:50.083 --> 09:54.999
If you've never owned anything,
now you can.

09:55.208 --> 09:57.624
A casino and a cafe.

09:58.458 --> 10:00.165
And coffee.

10:06.916 --> 10:08.665
Disgusting.

10:10.083 --> 10:12.415
What if I wanted to have a casino,
but not you?

10:15.208 --> 10:17.540
You'd have to kill me first then.

10:21.791 --> 10:23.790
It might have been even more difficult.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.582
I may want you without it all:

10:28.708 --> 10:32.124
the casino, the cafe, the coffee.

10:33.916 --> 10:37.124
I may want the guy for who he is,

10:37.416 --> 10:39.415
not for what he owns.

10:40.166 --> 10:42.165
Didn't you think of that?

10:44.416 --> 10:45.999
I didn't.

10:46.833 --> 10:48.832
But give me a chance.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.915
Let's see what we're like

10:52.791 --> 10:54.790
and if we're good for each other.

11:00.541 --> 11:02.165
I'm Mira.

11:05.333 --> 11:07.332
Mieczysław.

11:21.041 --> 11:22.707
Hycel?

11:27.250 --> 11:28.624
I've been looking for you.

11:34.791 --> 11:37.957
I want my old man to get the green card.

11:38.916 --> 11:42.749
- Blue. The green one is American.
- The blue card.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.832
Why, does he hit you?

11:46.083 --> 11:47.790
He shields himself.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.624
Shields himself?
How?

11:50.666 --> 11:57.290
He protects himself from
the Earth's magnetic field, water veins...

11:59.750 --> 12:01.749
How does he do that?

12:02.583 --> 12:04.582
He covers himself
with a cast-iron bathtub in bed.

12:06.125 --> 12:07.125
Bathtub? How?

12:09.166 --> 12:13.540
A bathtub turned over
like a cast-iron turtle.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.957
He keeps it in the bedroom
and there's no way to bathe.

12:17.791 --> 12:21.665
Chief, we've got an intervention.

12:22.416 --> 12:24.207
That's very good.

12:24.791 --> 12:26.665
- Who notified us?
- Jadźka, the supervisor.

12:26.708 --> 12:28.665
She heard a window breaking.

12:28.708 --> 12:32.540
He'll be making an inventory again.
It's this Karaś, I'm telling you.

13:09.958 --> 13:12.165
What are you doing?

13:12.375 --> 13:15.165
We'll put the blame on Karaś.

13:15.750 --> 13:18.082
Fuck! What blame?

13:18.208 --> 13:20.207
You'll be cleaning this!

13:20.291 --> 13:21.915
What the hell are you doing?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.540
Do you want us to get a heart attack?

13:23.541 --> 13:31.541
We were drinking, but we didn't steal.
Karaś is putting it all on the tab.

13:31.875 --> 13:34.540
- Show mister inspector...
- How many times

13:34.750 --> 13:42.750
have the police told you
to fuck off the only store in the area?

13:45.583 --> 13:47.790
Where are the people
going to buy milk this morning?

13:48.000 --> 13:51.374
Couldn't you fucking walk to Jastarnia
for a break-in?

13:51.500 --> 13:54.040
Mister inspector, we were thirsty.

13:54.166 --> 13:58.290
The fatty broke more than we consumed.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.915
Shut up or I'll gas you.
Cuff him.

14:08.958 --> 14:10.915
Don't take it off.

14:37.875 --> 14:41.832
- Carefully!
- Easy, it's not armed.

14:54.208 --> 14:56.207
It's not looking good.

14:56.375 --> 14:58.374
It was 15 years ago.

14:58.458 --> 15:01.582
The charges were dismissed
and the investigation was discontinued.

15:01.666 --> 15:03.665
It should've been erased long ago.

15:05.083 --> 15:07.082
Not in our papers.

15:07.833 --> 15:10.124
What did you do in Dąbrowa Górnicza?

15:10.625 --> 15:13.165
Burglaries, domestic violence,

15:13.416 --> 15:15.915
drunks, disturbing the peace.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.415
Why should I hire you with this record?

15:20.791 --> 15:24.832
I'd spent 20 years here before you.

15:25.083 --> 15:29.499
I met Goebbels in Katowice.
He told me nobody filled his shoes.

15:30.083 --> 15:35.624
And your code name,
Methyl, could you change it?

15:35.791 --> 15:37.082
What for?
I don't drink anymore.

15:43.750 --> 15:46.665
- Where to?
- To work, not to a whorehouse.

15:46.875 --> 15:49.999
Do you have to?
Now, when Majami ran and left it all?

15:50.791 --> 15:54.290
He got suspended,
but the investigation has to continue.

15:54.375 --> 15:58.082
That's your job, right?
They found a loser to do the grunt work!

15:58.583 --> 16:00.207
Don't wait for me.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.540
It'll end badly, you'll see!

16:03.916 --> 16:06.749
Don't slam the door!

16:20.791 --> 16:22.207
I looked after it.

16:22.333 --> 16:25.124
Sure, give the bum his vodka money!

16:25.166 --> 16:27.374
Find a job, you lazybones!

16:27.708 --> 16:30.249
Gawełek!
Get the fuck off my guy!

16:31.250 --> 16:35.665
- Give me.
- Wait for the bum to go away.

16:35.791 --> 16:37.457
Give it to me!

16:48.708 --> 16:50.165
Fuck!

16:57.166 --> 17:01.624
Jarek, what's going on?
What's going on? Jarek!

17:24.375 --> 17:27.415
- What's up?
- Somebody's car broke down.

17:27.458 --> 17:30.832
- Who was inside?
- Some guy. He wasn't lucky today.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.582
I know these plates.
He's one of us.

17:36.041 --> 17:38.207
- Soczek lives here. With his wife.
- Who?

17:38.250 --> 17:40.707
- Majami's former partner.
- Whose?

17:46.958 --> 17:48.957
Gawron's changed, hasn't he?

17:51.875 --> 17:55.165
He's in love.

17:56.416 --> 17:57.416
Right.

18:07.583 --> 18:09.165
Hi, sister.

18:09.416 --> 18:13.124
- Where's Gawron?
- In his room. I think he's asleep.

18:18.291 --> 18:21.499
What an ill-mannered boor.

18:33.458 --> 18:35.165
What's up?

18:35.875 --> 18:38.957
The legal eagle has reached
the escort from our convoy.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.582
He's open to cooperation
for at least eight grand.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.082
Why eight?

18:48.041 --> 18:51.332
He wants to buy a 50-inch TV.

18:51.666 --> 18:54.415
Give him something from our collection.

18:54.708 --> 18:57.624
Eight grand!
I get the runs when I hear such prices.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.999
Me? With bangs?

19:00.291 --> 19:02.290
I'd look like Dominikowa!

19:10.250 --> 19:11.957
Bring us some whisky.

19:12.666 --> 19:16.332
If you think you married a babe,
a pilot and a waitress all in one,

19:16.458 --> 19:19.207
you must've traded heads with a cow.

19:25.250 --> 19:27.790
I like her.
A strong character.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.165
Junior, bring us some whisky.

19:31.041 --> 19:32.874
They used Semtex.

19:33.166 --> 19:35.707
There's not much left of this Soczek.

19:35.833 --> 19:38.457
We sent it all to the lab.
They'll do it for tomorrow.

19:38.583 --> 19:42.249
I ordered the recordings
from the parking lot's CCTV cameras.

19:42.500 --> 19:46.707
He took over all Majami's cases.

19:46.875 --> 19:50.790
Didn't we give him any security
after that German gang's threats?

19:50.833 --> 19:54.290
Majami's security wasn't
automatically passed onto Soczek.

19:54.500 --> 19:59.332
- The recordings are worth watching.
- I just realized they are, thank you.

20:00.083 --> 20:03.457
Gentlemen!
One of us died.

20:03.666 --> 20:06.499
The culprit has to be caught.

20:06.625 --> 20:08.624
We have to promise that to one another.

20:08.791 --> 20:13.957
It's a priority and a matter of honor.

20:14.750 --> 20:19.207
We will use all the available methods
complying with the law and regulations.

20:19.500 --> 20:23.457
Also these rarely used.
I mean a direct infiltration.

20:23.708 --> 20:28.249
That's why I invited a colleague
who graduated from an FBI course.

20:28.833 --> 20:31.874
So that we understand each other well.
Undercover cop.

20:32.375 --> 20:35.707
- Excuse me?
- A mole. An officer playing a bandit.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.457
Some of our guys
don't have a problem with that.

20:40.708 --> 20:44.249
Good. I'll show you gentlemen something
that may explain the topic well.

20:51.541 --> 20:55.040
- Some hack wants to see Goebbels.
- Doesn't he know Goebbels' not here?

20:55.625 --> 20:58.707
Wait!
I'll check.

21:06.375 --> 21:08.082
- You wanted to see me?
- Are you Goebbels?

21:08.083 --> 21:09.874
- Yeah, I am.
- I wanted to see you.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.624
I work as part of a convoy.

21:11.833 --> 21:13.832
We're travelling to Sztum tomorrow.

21:14.083 --> 21:15.874
I was offered...

21:16.083 --> 21:18.082
I was offered...

21:19.083 --> 21:25.290
- Offered a bribe.
- Take it or inform the commissioner.

21:25.416 --> 21:28.165
- He's just drank coffee with Sugar.
- With what?

21:28.291 --> 21:30.999
- With Sugar, the bandit!

21:31.333 --> 21:35.207
- Why are you telling me this?
- All the crims in every slot say

21:36.000 --> 21:37.665
you're a fucker,

21:38.833 --> 21:39.915
but not bribable.

21:39.958 --> 21:44.124
Mateusz Wółkowski, alias Hycel, 41.

21:44.333 --> 21:48.957
- Should I introduce you to the topic?
- I know it even though I'm from Dąbrowa.

21:49.583 --> 21:52.457
The one ruffian working in Russia,
not the other way round.

21:52.541 --> 21:55.915
He killed three policemen in Kaliningrad
and ran away to Poland.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.874
Fatally struck a policeman in Suwałki.

21:59.958 --> 22:02.749
There's an international
arrest warrant issued for him.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.082
FSB arrested him about half a year ago
during a purchase of weapons...

22:07.166 --> 22:11.540
Annulate it then.
My people are working unnecessarily.

22:11.708 --> 22:17.415
Majami's suspended, Soczek's dead
and Goebbels left, so I'm "your people".

22:17.458 --> 22:19.874
Easy, gentlemen.

22:20.083 --> 22:22.499
It just so happens that
I have this arrest warrant with me.

22:22.541 --> 22:26.207
Due to the lack of a current photo,
it only includes a facial composite.

22:26.500 --> 22:27.832
Here you go.

22:31.750 --> 22:34.624
- But that's Despero.
- Who?

22:35.333 --> 22:38.332
Inspector Desperski.
He left Warsaw about 10 years ago.

22:38.500 --> 22:45.165
- He works in Słupsk or Wejherowo.
- He indeed looks like Desperski.

22:45.291 --> 22:48.332
He beat up a guy from Internal Affairs.

22:48.541 --> 22:50.915
He had to be relegated after that.

22:51.041 --> 22:53.707
Hycel looks like Despero.

22:53.833 --> 22:57.207
Our undercover cop.

23:57.208 --> 23:58.999
We've got one shot.

23:59.041 --> 24:00.915
Prepare the blockade.

24:07.875 --> 24:09.499
A motorcycle!

24:13.416 --> 24:14.540
Get down!

24:14.583 --> 24:16.499
Police! Freeze!

24:27.708 --> 24:29.249
Get him!

25:05.208 --> 25:06.208
Repeat.

25:08.041 --> 25:10.415
Repeat.
Once again!

25:18.000 --> 25:19.457
Hi, Despero.

25:23.375 --> 25:25.082
Oh man.

25:31.208 --> 25:33.749
Methyl.
Hi there.

25:34.083 --> 25:36.332
- Howdy, Nielat.
- He's Quantico now.

25:43.333 --> 25:46.665
- What happened to Goebbels?
- A stink with your inspector.

25:46.708 --> 25:48.665
Goebbels left with him to Katowice.

25:48.791 --> 25:51.457
They met with Methyl there.

25:51.583 --> 25:55.207
He said the department is in ruins
and they'd hire anybody, even me.

25:58.291 --> 26:00.290
- Did he let it go?
- Apparently he did.

26:00.375 --> 26:02.957
- Did you let it go?
- I had 10 years for that.

26:06.625 --> 26:08.124
Did he say anything?

26:12.166 --> 26:14.749
- I want in on my desk tomorrow morning.
- Do they have anything?

26:14.833 --> 26:19.790
- I'll go take a leak, you have a talk.
- Stay, it may concern you as well.

26:20.041 --> 26:23.582
CTs eliminated the motorcyclists
on the highway just before the border.

26:23.875 --> 26:26.124
- One of them testified perimortem.
- About Soczek?

26:26.166 --> 26:27.374
He testified in Arabic.

26:27.416 --> 26:30.040
Oh, that's problematic.
In Poznańskie, they speak German,

26:30.083 --> 26:32.582
mostly "hende hoch" and "nicht sliesen".

26:32.666 --> 26:34.540
One of them recorded him.

26:34.625 --> 26:36.540
He'd come in handy for you.

26:36.625 --> 26:42.415
- He gets twice the money in the squad.
- The investigative service is romantic.

26:44.208 --> 26:45.874
Show him.

26:52.500 --> 26:55.165
Mateusz Wółkowski, alias Hycel.

26:57.291 --> 27:00.457
He's run over the officer in Suwałki.
Is it a joke?

27:00.666 --> 27:04.290
The Russkis arrested him 6 months ago.
They're keeping him in solitary.

27:04.416 --> 27:08.374
He's been operating in Russia.
Here he's known for ruffian notoriety.

27:08.625 --> 27:10.082
And? I don't know the topic.

27:10.166 --> 27:14.374
And get the fuck out of Jurata
to play a bandit in Warsaw.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.165
Me? You mean me?

27:17.250 --> 27:21.332
Yeah, you. At first, they wanted me,
but supposedly I'm too short.

27:23.583 --> 27:26.374
Quantico, what's going on?

27:26.875 --> 27:29.832
The idea is mine and only mine.

27:30.291 --> 27:33.165
And who knows about it?

27:33.500 --> 27:35.499
Us, the commissioner, and Barszczyk.

27:35.583 --> 27:37.582
Five people total.
Just five.

27:37.625 --> 27:41.790
Unless he smuggles a message from jail.
Then Wołomin and Pruszków will know

27:41.833 --> 27:44.457
that one Hycel serves his time
and the other pretends to be him.

27:44.458 --> 27:47.415
No message has ever been smuggled
from where the Russkis are keeping him.

27:47.500 --> 27:51.457
We'll send out a fake saying
that he's being extradited to Poland.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.499
Get it?

27:54.291 --> 27:56.290
And why would I agree to that?

27:56.666 --> 27:59.290
A 780 zloty bonus, that's one.

28:00.250 --> 28:02.249
I'm not even mentioning
how romantic it is.

28:02.583 --> 28:07.499
- They need to cop it.
- They do, no matter what.

28:07.708 --> 28:11.665
- Haven't the CTs absolved them yet?
- They have.

28:12.166 --> 28:14.874
It might have been a gang's revenge
and we're done, but maybe not.

28:15.125 --> 28:17.499
Maybe someone hired them
but lies in wait himself.

28:17.916 --> 28:20.665
We have to make sure we've got them all.

28:22.666 --> 28:25.249
- Can I sleep on it?
- Sure.

28:25.333 --> 28:27.749
What about us?

28:27.916 --> 28:32.457
Bryza is empty this time of year.
They have a discount, 580 per sack.

28:40.666 --> 28:47.790
Don't say a word. I'll guess.
You're a swindler. You - an alcoholic.

28:47.833 --> 28:50.957
- But they don't arrest for that.
- Call Despero.

28:59.250 --> 29:00.707
He's not picking up.

29:10.583 --> 29:15.999
"Some of us can't wait for spring.

29:16.083 --> 29:24.083
On February 24th Ryszard N., 38,
exposed himself in Skaryszewski Park

29:25.458 --> 29:29.207
in front of a group of students
from a nearby nursing high school

29:29.250 --> 29:37.250
and repeated his stunt in the afternoon
in front of a hairdresser's salon.

29:38.750 --> 29:45.290
Council for minor offences
evaluated Ryszard's performance

29:45.333 --> 29:49.540
for 3 months of imprisonment."

29:49.625 --> 29:50.790
That's not much.

29:50.833 --> 29:54.665
The councils were abolished in 1990.
You've been carrying this for 27 years?

29:54.750 --> 29:56.332
It's still clean!

29:58.458 --> 30:00.332
Come in, inspector.

30:01.083 --> 30:03.749
Especially that it's kinda your place.

30:04.208 --> 30:05.374
I'm in.

30:46.750 --> 30:48.290
We found them.

30:48.458 --> 30:50.874
Are they the same ones
who threatened Majami last year?

30:51.000 --> 30:55.790
We don't know.
They all died during the arrest attempt.

30:56.166 --> 30:57.874
They're dead?

30:58.291 --> 31:00.415
It won't bring Jarek back.

31:00.791 --> 31:02.332
It won't.

31:03.708 --> 31:06.374
Maybe you've seen something?
Maybe you'd recognize them?

31:06.583 --> 31:09.499
Nothing.
Not much.

31:10.041 --> 31:14.207
Jarek went out, I ran to wave to him,
and then this blast.

31:15.666 --> 31:17.665
Fuck!

31:18.416 --> 31:22.790
I've told him so many times
not to take over this Majami's case.

31:27.458 --> 31:30.582
Have you seen any motorcyclists?

31:30.708 --> 31:35.290
I don't remember.
I was deafened.

31:35.875 --> 31:37.874
Maybe I'll recall something later.

31:38.750 --> 31:40.749
Yeah, call me then.

31:43.583 --> 31:46.374
What am I supposed to bury?

31:46.500 --> 31:49.582
I don't know.
Some mortal remains.

31:50.833 --> 31:52.624
Maybe the uniform?

31:54.166 --> 31:55.874
Goodbye.

32:03.916 --> 32:06.124
- Good morning.
- Morning.

32:08.166 --> 32:12.290
- Howdy, dear ladies. Where's Gawron?
- Plotting with Junior inside.

32:16.875 --> 32:18.415
Greetings.

32:19.666 --> 32:23.499
- This Kowal is so polite.
- Be careful, okay?

32:23.833 --> 32:26.707
- About what?
- Be careful.

32:26.833 --> 32:33.165
Mister Kowal is married,
just like you are, I think.

32:33.458 --> 32:35.957
Jesus, you two are a perfect match.

32:36.833 --> 32:39.540
There's a good stretch next to Mława.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.374
I'm glad you're here.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.290
You'll go to Mława with Junior.

33:04.291 --> 33:07.249
Repeat.
Once again!

33:08.166 --> 33:10.165
Do you understand anything?

33:10.333 --> 33:13.999
Only the CT.
"Noch einmal", "once again", something.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.165
We've got the translation.

33:23.250 --> 33:27.874
"I didn't make it to kill your officer.
Allah is great, there is no other god."

33:28.041 --> 33:32.124
- Soczek didn't die of fright.
- Do you have the parking lot recording?

33:42.708 --> 33:45.707
There you go.
They'd been tampering with the car.

33:45.958 --> 33:48.415
- Did the van leave during the day?
- It didn't.

33:58.375 --> 34:01.499
We've got the third eyewitness then.

34:01.666 --> 34:04.915
The widow, the neighbor with the kid
and this cuckoo here.

34:05.041 --> 34:08.081
Barszczyk is questioning the neighbor.
Print it for me.

34:12.041 --> 34:15.498
I was mainly worried about my child,
I wasn't memorizing details.

34:15.750 --> 34:17.248
Who's this?

34:17.625 --> 34:20.415
Gawełek.
Our neighborhood bum.

34:20.458 --> 34:23.040
Rummages through dumps,
collects cans, makes a mess.

34:23.125 --> 34:25.581
How do you know it's him
if you can't see his face?

34:25.750 --> 34:28.415
Because no matter the season,
he wears this military coat.

35:03.083 --> 35:04.915
Who are you?

35:05.541 --> 35:07.415
The Nutcracker.

35:07.916 --> 35:09.249
I don't know you.

35:09.708 --> 35:12.540
I'm Lupa.
Serving life.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.999
That's quite a lot.

35:16.583 --> 35:20.374
I haven't even entered my new cell yet
and I already found a fag.

35:21.875 --> 35:23.332
Why me?

35:23.625 --> 35:26.582
There's nobody else here
and the hacks disgust me.

35:27.250 --> 35:30.999
Your life sentence
may not even be five minutes long.

35:31.208 --> 35:32.208
What the fuck?

35:32.291 --> 35:34.332
That's how long it'll take
me to take the cuffs off,

35:34.458 --> 35:38.415
open the door and smash
your stupid dome.

36:01.125 --> 36:04.999
Where's Quantico?
I don't want to do his job.

36:05.083 --> 36:06.832
On a mission.

36:08.916 --> 36:10.790
Where will I find Gawełek?

36:11.583 --> 36:16.207
He used to live in a squat in Grochów.

36:16.500 --> 36:24.040
Now he hangs out
in the basement of this house.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.499
I haven't seen him in two days though.

36:27.416 --> 36:29.040
We'll manage.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.915
You're clever. Thief?
Why are you wearing these colors?

36:37.708 --> 36:39.374
Fuck, let me go!

36:43.125 --> 36:45.957
- I've got an escort.
- What do you mean?

36:47.458 --> 36:48.707
A bribed one.

36:48.875 --> 36:51.082
How could such a jerk
like you bribe an escort?

36:51.125 --> 36:53.124
Not me.
Gawron.

36:54.500 --> 36:55.874
Gawron?

36:57.208 --> 36:59.499
That guy from Pruszków?

36:59.666 --> 37:01.665
That one.

37:02.375 --> 37:05.415
You're strong!
Do you work out?

37:05.583 --> 37:07.915
I kill horses with a hammer in Italy.

37:08.125 --> 37:09.707
What about this escort?

37:09.791 --> 37:12.624
He'll get sick and they'll stop.

37:12.750 --> 37:14.749
Gawron's crew will set us free.

37:14.791 --> 37:16.790
Will you put in a good word for me?

37:18.041 --> 37:19.165
Do I have a choice?

37:22.541 --> 37:24.999
There are no lightbulbs.

37:41.166 --> 37:43.749
They're all closed.

38:18.666 --> 38:20.749
He's not stiff.
He's been dead for three, four days.

38:20.833 --> 38:23.707
So this is this Gawełek of yours?

38:23.916 --> 38:25.915
Let the undertakers take him to the lab.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.457
- I'll go get that janitor.
- What you looking for?

38:28.541 --> 38:31.124
Police. Do you know him?

38:33.250 --> 38:36.457
- Sure I do. It's Zachariasz.
- Zachariasz who?

38:37.666 --> 38:41.832
- He's loaded like a freight train.
- And who are you?

38:41.916 --> 38:45.082
I'm sweet Gawełek.

38:45.208 --> 38:49.124
- Who decorated him like that?
- I did!

38:50.125 --> 38:54.540
Let the drunkard see
what he looks like when he wakes up.

38:54.708 --> 38:58.874
He guzzled all my booze
so I dressed him up with the pine.

38:59.125 --> 39:01.374
And where's your Capote,
the one you always wear?

39:01.791 --> 39:06.165
Peddled to a sucker for two hundred
the day before yesterday.

39:06.750 --> 39:12.082
- Two hundred for such a rag!
- So it wasn't you on the other side?

39:12.458 --> 39:13.749
Heavens, no!

39:13.791 --> 39:17.707
There was such a fucking gas explosion
there would be nothing left of Gawełek.

39:17.833 --> 39:21.207
Why do you call yourself "Gawełek"?

39:21.583 --> 39:23.582
That's my name!

39:23.625 --> 39:27.457
- Would you recognize the sucker?
- I sure would.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.707
Zachariasz witnessed the transaction.

39:29.750 --> 39:34.124
He won't ever recognize anyone again,
even himself decorated with the pine.

39:44.291 --> 39:45.082
It's them.

39:45.208 --> 39:48.040
Easy. Don't provoke them.
Everything will be okay.

39:48.833 --> 39:51.749
We'll stop shortly and you'll puke.
Do you have something to do it with?

39:51.791 --> 39:56.040
- I took scrambled eggs in my Thermos.
- Okay, cool, it will do.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.540
Ready?

40:01.791 --> 40:03.332
Alright.

40:23.375 --> 40:25.790
- Are you transporting Lupa?
- Yeah, but with another one.

40:25.958 --> 40:28.374
- He was supposed to be alone.
- It's not me who decides.

40:28.750 --> 40:31.249
- What's he doing?
- Making up an alibi.

40:31.666 --> 40:34.290
- Should I put you to sleep as an alibi?
- I'll do it myself.

40:40.583 --> 40:44.582
- You're fucked up.
- Take his keys. Hurry!

40:45.833 --> 40:49.332
- Keys.
- Hurry, we're making a show.

40:49.833 --> 40:52.874
Jesus! I can't do it, guys.

40:54.166 --> 40:55.957
Done.

40:59.833 --> 41:01.832
What the fuck is going on?
Who uncuffed you?

41:02.083 --> 41:05.665
He's suspiciously skilled with a pick.
Off him if you've got a piece.

41:06.250 --> 41:09.749
- I wasn't told to do so.
- But he must be a rat of some sort.

41:11.166 --> 41:13.374
So? Are you a rat?

41:14.041 --> 41:15.249
Hycel.

41:16.625 --> 41:18.624
- What?
- I'm Hycel.

41:19.500 --> 41:23.290
If he's Hycel, Gawron will be happier
to see him than you.

41:24.166 --> 41:27.332
At least check if he's not wired up.

41:37.458 --> 41:39.124
Nothing.

41:40.375 --> 41:42.915
Lend me a coat.
I'm all red here like a hoodlum.

41:44.583 --> 41:48.165
Yes, we're done.
Done, I'm telling you.

41:49.916 --> 41:54.124
Just like Kowal said.
Gawron is happier to see you than him.

41:54.958 --> 41:56.582
Have you gone fucking mad?

41:56.875 --> 41:58.457
I'm serving life.

41:58.708 --> 42:00.540
They can't give me anything more.

42:00.666 --> 42:03.082
I'll come in handy more than he will.

42:03.166 --> 42:06.207
We'll pull off to the forest
and you'll off Lupa.

42:06.666 --> 42:11.249
What? This fag who claims to be Hycel?

42:11.833 --> 42:13.540
Alright.

42:30.375 --> 42:37.082
Seven, six, five, four, three, two,
I'm leaving one.

42:39.500 --> 42:41.499
- Reloaded.
- What the fuck?

42:42.208 --> 42:44.207
Gawron paid for me.

42:44.458 --> 42:47.290
Hycel has to prove himself.

42:47.875 --> 42:49.874
Why doesn't he off you then?

42:50.041 --> 42:53.040
Junior! Let him off Kowal!

42:53.666 --> 42:57.582
- Fuck, have some dignity.
- He's tried to off me once already.

42:57.750 --> 43:00.999
Five minutes ago.
Was it a joke?

43:01.916 --> 43:03.415
Yeah, true.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.582
- Why?
- How could I know it was Hycel?

43:06.791 --> 43:09.207
There's a fag and he's not using cant.

43:09.291 --> 43:11.999
I understand, but Gawron told us...

43:31.458 --> 43:34.915
A 9mm misfiring?
Nice. I guess it was empty.

43:39.250 --> 43:41.249
I won't forgive you, Hycel!

43:43.375 --> 43:48.624
Okay, let's go.
No offense.

44:03.166 --> 44:05.082
What's up?
What happened to your head?

44:05.166 --> 44:07.374
Alibi.
They took him, so it's alright.

44:07.625 --> 44:09.415
- What now?
- We're staying out of touch.

44:09.500 --> 44:13.457
- How's it going?
- He pointed one out, but he's not sure.

44:18.500 --> 44:23.874
Wiśniewski Marian, alias Mountain,
convicted for 15 years imprisonment.

44:23.958 --> 44:27.540
- Released after nine years last year.
- Do you know where he got his alias?

44:27.708 --> 44:29.540
No, I must've had already left
for the States.

44:29.625 --> 44:33.749
He strangled a kid
to steal his mountain bike.

44:35.833 --> 44:37.082
It's him.

44:37.333 --> 44:40.165
Him? Are you sure now?

44:41.291 --> 44:42.790
Sure.

44:43.416 --> 44:47.749
He looked more like a hoodlum
than a sucker from the very start.

44:48.458 --> 44:50.290
We're looking for a hoodlum then.

44:50.375 --> 44:53.290
They called from the forensic lab,
will you drive there?

44:58.375 --> 45:01.374
- Hey, who are these babes?
- Who could they be? Ukrainians.

45:01.625 --> 45:05.374
Howdy, Ukrahookers,
we'll be slaying these pussies soon.

45:05.458 --> 45:08.999
- Sure thing!
- You'll talk to Gawron first.

45:12.625 --> 45:15.665
You've been in Russia,
so you're not exactly in on the topic.

45:15.750 --> 45:18.165
I know a thing or two.
I differentiate Pruszków from Wołomin.

45:18.208 --> 45:21.332
Keep it up like this.
We let you go.

45:22.333 --> 45:26.332
- We should get something in return.
- I can pay you back.

45:26.666 --> 45:29.457
Do you have some money buried?
How are you going to pay up?

45:29.708 --> 45:32.124
Half the city is mine,
the other half belongs to Wołomin.

45:32.166 --> 45:35.415
- I'll be taking from the other half.
- Do you know Wołowina?

45:35.708 --> 45:39.165
Obuch, Lalunia, Krawat?
Aren't you afraid of them?

45:39.541 --> 45:41.540
The only thing I fear is God.

45:43.500 --> 45:46.082
You ransomed Lupa out of prison
because you want to off someone.

45:46.125 --> 45:49.207
- I'll do it and we'll be all square.
- We'll get back to this topic.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.582
It's a phone.
Pick it up.

45:58.875 --> 46:01.457
Kowal will fix you some gear and dough.

46:01.625 --> 46:02.749
Turn up the sound.

46:03.166 --> 46:04.624
I'll borrow it at 10%.

46:04.708 --> 46:08.582
According to the Warsaw police,
today in the morning next to Mława

46:08.625 --> 46:12.540
two criminals convicted, among others,
for murders and attacks on policemen

46:12.791 --> 46:18.207
escaped from the prison convoy.

46:18.375 --> 46:22.249
They are Krystian Nowacki, alias Lupa,

46:22.416 --> 46:25.790
and Mateusz Wółkowski, alias Hycel.

46:26.083 --> 46:28.082
- Lupa?
- Huh?

46:30.083 --> 46:31.874
No offense, Hycel.

46:32.250 --> 46:33.999
Ukrahookers, move your asses!

46:34.125 --> 46:38.415
Or I'll turn the TV off!
We're going upstairs!

46:48.916 --> 46:52.624
- What's this?
- Not "what", but "who". Soczek.

46:53.541 --> 46:56.082
It's a part of the left temporal bone.

46:56.666 --> 47:02.457
You can see this fragment,
unusually regular for a crushed bone.

47:02.958 --> 47:04.749
It's a bullet hole.

47:05.250 --> 47:08.540
In my opinion, it's a 9mm caliber.

47:09.041 --> 47:09.957
What does it mean?

47:10.000 --> 47:17.290
He either lived with a bullet
or somebody shot him.

47:17.333 --> 47:19.790
The explosion ripped up
an already dead body.

47:22.708 --> 47:24.332
Excuse me.

47:30.500 --> 47:32.499
We're looking for a culprit,
not an eyewitness.

47:32.625 --> 47:34.957
Mountain shot Soczek
before the explosion.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.249
That's why the Arab said
that he didn't make it.

47:38.625 --> 47:40.624
Why do we need a scandal
with Wołomin?

47:40.708 --> 47:43.790
It's peaceful now
and everybody benefits.

47:44.041 --> 47:46.749
They want to join us!
We don't have too many people.

47:46.791 --> 47:50.624
- We've got Lupa and Hycel now.
- Hycel!

47:51.916 --> 47:54.457
You can't be sure of Hycel
if something goes wrong.

47:54.916 --> 47:58.665
Everything will go wrong
if you keep poaching their guys!

48:03.375 --> 48:04.749
Grandma,

48:05.000 --> 48:07.415
I made you hot cocoa and a yeast cake.

48:10.208 --> 48:11.790
Grandma!

48:18.916 --> 48:20.499
Grandma?

48:23.291 --> 48:24.291
Grandma!

48:31.708 --> 48:33.249
Grandma!

48:41.166 --> 48:42.457
Oh my God!

48:45.583 --> 48:48.290
Grandma, where are you going?

48:48.583 --> 48:51.582
In your nightgown only!
Give it to me, you'll get tired.

48:51.916 --> 48:54.582
- Where are you going?
- To visit your sister.

48:55.125 --> 48:57.374
But I don't have a sister!

48:57.875 --> 49:02.332
I'm not Helenka, I'm her daughter.

49:02.750 --> 49:04.415
Don't you recognize me?

49:04.625 --> 49:09.582
- And aunt Jadzia lives in Canada.
- How? You're not Helenka?

49:10.208 --> 49:11.790
Just look at me.

49:11.916 --> 49:14.290
I got it all wrong.

49:14.708 --> 49:17.165
So Jadzia is in Canada?

49:17.500 --> 49:21.040
She's been there for a long time.
We can visit her if you want.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.165
But not today. Come.

49:23.416 --> 49:27.124
- I made you hot cocoa and a yeast cake.
- What about Helenka?

49:28.750 --> 49:30.332
Mom died.

49:30.625 --> 49:32.165
A long time ago.

49:32.416 --> 49:35.082
Come. It's chilly in the evening.

49:35.250 --> 49:37.874
You'll catch a cold.

49:45.333 --> 49:48.707
If not to the cemetery,
then maybe to a nursing home at least?

49:48.958 --> 49:50.582
Fuck off, douchebag.

49:50.833 --> 49:52.290
Helenka?

49:52.750 --> 49:58.082
- Your brother-in-law is a boor.
- He is.

50:03.083 --> 50:04.332
And?

50:06.208 --> 50:09.165
Two guys from Wołomin
want to change team colors.

50:09.375 --> 50:11.374
Obuch and Lalunia.

50:12.125 --> 50:14.124
There has two of us, too.

50:14.625 --> 50:15.790
What about Lupa?

50:16.208 --> 50:18.374
He's nervous and shoots quickly.

50:18.416 --> 50:22.290
We need peace and negotiations,
not cussing and bashing.

50:22.750 --> 50:24.749
And Wołomin will talk to me?

50:25.541 --> 50:27.124
I'll talk.

50:28.291 --> 50:30.290
You just be there, that's enough.

50:39.333 --> 50:45.290
- It was supposed to be two each.
- They want to join, we set the terms.

50:45.416 --> 50:47.957
- We're all going.
- But it can get nasty.

50:48.458 --> 50:50.457
And what the fuck
will they do to us?

50:54.000 --> 50:55.999
Welcome.

50:57.041 --> 50:59.665
Greetings
to the Wołomin underworld.

51:00.958 --> 51:02.957
- Hi there.
- Hi.

51:05.250 --> 51:09.124
- Who's this?
- Hycel. He's with us now.

51:09.583 --> 51:13.040
The one who offed the Soviet cops?
Respect, Hycel.

51:14.041 --> 51:15.582
This is Lalunia.

51:16.541 --> 51:20.124
- You talk then, I'll have a bourbon.
- We've got vodka.

51:20.208 --> 51:22.207
Vodka gives me heartburn.

51:22.833 --> 51:24.832
Sit down. Pour it, Lalunia.

51:25.500 --> 51:28.540
- Hey, Obuch, what's up?
- Help yourselves, I'll be right back.

51:28.583 --> 51:32.124
- Pour it.
- Tell them that dry joke.

51:33.166 --> 51:38.374
Ambulance's riding at night.
The driver and the paramedic...

51:38.625 --> 51:40.290
Bartender!

51:42.166 --> 51:43.290
What's up?

51:43.375 --> 51:45.957
I rent a room,
arrange everything, and you disdain?

51:46.166 --> 51:47.624
You want bourbon?

51:47.708 --> 51:48.957
My vodka's no good?

51:49.000 --> 51:53.374
- No, why...
- Come drink with us then.

51:53.416 --> 51:57.749
- The bartender's coming.
- He sure is. Come on!

52:19.375 --> 52:23.124
Hold it.
It's nothing, just a scratch.

52:24.208 --> 52:27.082
Is this emergency?
A shootout at the Antoine Motel.

52:27.250 --> 52:30.499
Two heavily wounded people.
Who's speaking? Gallus Anonymus!

52:30.875 --> 52:34.124
Hold it. You can do it. Good job.

52:34.375 --> 52:36.290
Give me the tablecloths!
We have to staunch him.

52:36.333 --> 52:39.173
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- I'm not leaving him here with Obuch!

52:39.208 --> 52:41.665
- Fuck!
- Hold it, Kowal.

52:43.708 --> 52:45.957
We're getting the fuck out of here,
you called the cops!

52:46.000 --> 52:47.999
Give me the fucking tablecloths!

52:55.708 --> 53:00.415
- Hold it. You'll be in hospital soon.
- We were playing for the same team...

53:00.541 --> 53:02.582
- Quiet!
- To Wołomin...

53:02.666 --> 53:06.707
Don't say anything. Just lie.
Wait for the ambulance.

53:13.666 --> 53:16.790
Put Lalunia's prints on the Glock.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

53:26.833 --> 53:30.249
- They'll change your alias for Sieve!
- Mask!

53:30.333 --> 53:32.832
If you can breathe on your own,
you can be questioned as well.

53:32.875 --> 53:35.499
- Did you Obuch and Lalunia?
- I don't know these guys.

53:35.583 --> 53:37.915
Wołowina won't forgive you.
You wasted two of his gangstas.

53:37.958 --> 53:39.957
Next time you may not
be that far from dying.

53:40.083 --> 53:42.457
What Wołowina?
Wołowina from Wołomin.

53:42.541 --> 53:45.290
- Where's Gawron?
- I don't know Gawron.

53:47.583 --> 53:50.290
- Chairman Gawroński left.
- Where to?

53:50.375 --> 53:52.082
- I don't know.
- When is he coming back?

53:52.208 --> 53:55.415
I don't know.
He said something about Szpilka's fight.

54:09.291 --> 54:13.124
- Did you see how Szpila whacked him?
- No, I didn't. Which one is Szpila?

54:13.208 --> 54:14.957
Fuck, put this phone down!

54:32.208 --> 54:35.749
Hey, you, move!
You're blocking our ladies' view.

54:35.833 --> 54:37.499
- Shut up, fag.
- Fag?!

54:37.625 --> 54:43.040
- Hey, you, calm down!
- Because?

54:43.125 --> 54:45.415
Because Mr. Szpilka is angry
that nobody's watching him.

54:45.416 --> 54:47.415
Back to your seats
or I'll call the cops!

54:47.833 --> 54:50.832
- Sit.
- Calm down.

54:53.500 --> 54:56.207
- What are you doing them?
- Fuck you!

55:03.041 --> 55:04.915
They don't know about Kowal.

55:05.458 --> 55:08.499
They're not sure who whacked these two.

55:09.166 --> 55:11.832
They'll get it once they know
that Kowal is busted up in hospital.

55:11.958 --> 55:17.207
- Thank you. I'm going home.
- Wait. There are seven rounds left.

55:18.375 --> 55:22.332
- Hycel, will you drive me?
- But I wanted to watch the fight!

55:23.500 --> 55:26.165
Drive her!
We'll tell you all about it.

55:26.958 --> 55:28.499
Okay.

55:29.250 --> 55:31.249
- Calm down.
- Okay.

55:43.041 --> 55:46.165
What?
Do you want to ask me something?

55:46.375 --> 55:47.832
No, I don't.

55:47.958 --> 55:49.957
Why do they call you Hycel?

55:50.375 --> 55:52.790
No reason.
Why do they call your husband Gawron?

55:52.875 --> 55:54.499
Because his last name is Gawroński.

55:54.583 --> 55:57.790
- Is your last name Hyclowski?
- No, Wółkowski.

55:58.083 --> 56:00.665
You should be called Wół.

56:01.416 --> 56:04.665
Is there a Mrs. Wół?

56:06.000 --> 56:07.582
No, there isn't.

56:09.166 --> 56:10.665
That's a pity.

56:10.791 --> 56:12.582
She'd be the Wół's gal.

56:13.708 --> 56:15.707
It's nice talking to you.

56:16.125 --> 56:18.749
We're going to Masuria tomorrow,
so we'll talk more.

57:00.208 --> 57:02.374
- Yeah?
- What was the fuss for?

57:02.541 --> 57:05.874
- We were to stay out of touch.
- We know who offed Soczek.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.624
- Marian Wiśniewski, alias Mountain.
- I know the case.

57:08.875 --> 57:11.749
- There's a link between him and Gawron.
- Anything else?

57:11.916 --> 57:15.332
You've got Mountain in your inbox.
Who was shooting in the Antoine Motel?

57:15.500 --> 57:17.874
Me, Kowal and Junior.
Wołomin started.

57:18.291 --> 57:20.499
Can we jail Junior for murder?

57:20.625 --> 57:24.040
Firstly, he'll claim self-defense,
and secondly, we want Gawron, right?

57:24.291 --> 57:26.749
Subject discussed.
Look at Mountain and destroy the card.

58:00.041 --> 58:02.040
Good morning, Mr. Chairman.

58:02.791 --> 58:06.207
- Is the floor booked?
- Of course, just like you said.

58:06.500 --> 58:10.457
You occupy four apartments.

58:10.625 --> 58:12.624
There are 12, so I thought...

58:12.750 --> 58:16.290
They're supposed to stay empty.
Don't think too much.

58:21.666 --> 58:24.124
- What will we do with Antoine?
- What?

58:24.250 --> 58:26.374
We can't leave it like this,
they wanted to whack me!

58:26.416 --> 58:29.874
We'll talk about it in Warsaw.
We're having fun now.

58:30.375 --> 58:33.332
Darling, try this.

58:35.375 --> 58:36.624
It's good!

58:39.375 --> 58:44.999
- You're cutting too much.
- It's fine, you have to be strong.

59:06.958 --> 59:09.707
We're looking like morons
at a village disco.

59:10.833 --> 59:14.665
- I'll let the rabble in.
- No, don't. Hycel told us not to.

59:15.041 --> 59:17.540
Hycel doesn't make the rules here.

59:21.291 --> 59:23.040
Come in!

59:26.500 --> 59:28.499
Easy, let them have fun.

59:29.166 --> 59:32.749
These guys were obeying someone,
they weren't lone kamikazes.

59:33.083 --> 59:34.624
What can you do?

59:35.291 --> 59:37.332
You can't do anything!
Youth.

59:42.541 --> 59:44.207
Just don't drink.

59:45.041 --> 59:46.665
And be careful.

01:00:08.958 --> 01:00:11.082
Have fun, Mira!

01:00:12.125 --> 01:00:14.124
We'll pay!

01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:26.999
Leave it.
Chairman Gawroński will pay.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.249
Leave him!
Save Gawron!

01:01:21.375 --> 01:01:22.375
He's dead!

01:01:24.583 --> 01:01:26.582
Take the piece and give me the keys.

01:01:27.041 --> 01:01:30.332
- Give me the fucking keys!
- Fuck, wait!

01:01:58.583 --> 01:02:00.790
Jesus, they let you go.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.624
I was afraid they'd arrest you.

01:02:03.666 --> 01:02:06.582
Careful.
They've just stitched me up.

01:02:07.166 --> 01:02:09.749
I have to report
to the Prosecutor's Office in Warsaw.

01:02:10.375 --> 01:02:13.082
- Where's Mira?
- I'm here.

01:02:15.291 --> 01:02:18.665
- Do you need anything?
- An alive husband?

01:02:23.041 --> 01:02:25.040
I'll go take a nap.

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:27.374
You should try as well before we leave.

01:02:52.041 --> 01:02:53.707
Who is it?

01:02:54.333 --> 01:02:55.790
Who is it?

01:02:57.458 --> 01:03:01.332
What are you doing here?
What happened?

01:03:01.583 --> 01:03:04.582
Mira asked for her purse,
she says she'd left some medicine there.

01:03:04.833 --> 01:03:10.082
Is she okay? What purse?
There's nothing here.

01:03:10.208 --> 01:03:13.332
But what... Help!

01:03:29.208 --> 01:03:31.207
Fuck, finally.

01:03:42.541 --> 01:03:46.915
I need an ambulance to room 1131.
Immediately.

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.207
- Why here?
- For our sins.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.832
I can't enter the station
until the case is not closed.

01:04:04.291 --> 01:04:05.999
The case is closed.

01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:07.749
We're finishing the mission.

01:04:07.833 --> 01:04:11.457
Gawron's dead and we'll arrest Junior
for what happened in the Antoine Motel.

01:04:11.541 --> 01:04:13.957
Gawron didn't order to off Soczek.

01:04:15.375 --> 01:04:18.999
- It's weird that Mountain shot Gawron.
- Maybe they argued over dough.

01:04:19.125 --> 01:04:22.624
- Gawron didn't recognize Mountain.
- What?

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:28.832
He saw him for the first time ever.
I'm telling you what I know.

01:04:29.125 --> 01:04:32.707
- Gawron didn't order to off Soczek.
- Do you have proof for that?

01:04:33.416 --> 01:04:34.749
No, you don't.

01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:38.332
We assume Gawron's the commissioner.

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:42.915
We'll go after Mountain as the culprit
using standard methods.

01:04:42.958 --> 01:04:47.915
Mountain will come back to kill Junior.
We're lucky that Despero was around.

01:04:48.083 --> 01:04:50.874
There's going to be a set-to
between Pruszków and Wołomin.

01:04:51.166 --> 01:04:54.707
We can have them all. Both gangs.
I need three months.

01:04:54.791 --> 01:04:56.582
- That is out of the question.
- Two then.

01:04:56.708 --> 01:04:58.707
Six weeks.

01:04:59.708 --> 01:05:01.332
A month.

01:05:01.625 --> 01:05:06.415
And before you use your gun next time,
you'll call Quantico first.

01:05:06.458 --> 01:05:09.707
- Understood?
- Sure. Obvious obviousness.

01:05:10.541 --> 01:05:14.082
That He'll resurrect
the bodies of our brother and sister...

01:05:25.041 --> 01:05:30.749
- How long's this party going to take?
- Fuck, Ananas. A while, okay?

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:38.749
My deepest condolences.

01:05:51.416 --> 01:05:59.416
I'm sorry we meet in such circumstances.
So sad... Such a tragedy...

01:06:01.916 --> 01:06:04.499
I couldn't make it to the cemetery.
The cops had their spy there.

01:06:04.541 --> 01:06:06.499
- My condolences.
- Get stuffed with them.

01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:10.832
- You were supposed to guard us.
- Leave him. He guarded us two.

01:06:11.291 --> 01:06:14.207
I'm glad you're here.
Go talk to Kowal.

01:06:44.791 --> 01:06:47.624
- Did you call me?
- Yeah. Where's Kowal?

01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:50.249
He said he was going to get a dress.

01:06:50.416 --> 01:06:52.415
I want to change.

01:06:53.541 --> 01:06:56.499
- So what do we do?
- We wait.

01:06:56.833 --> 01:06:58.374
Give me one.

01:07:05.791 --> 01:07:07.790
What?
Are my hands shaking?

01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:10.665
No. Mine are shaking,

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.499
but I don't want to show that.

01:07:31.916 --> 01:07:33.665
Here you are.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.415
Good, because I need access
to Gawron's desk to get papers.

01:07:37.958 --> 01:07:40.832
I also need the passwords
to the company's accounts.

01:07:40.875 --> 01:07:44.665
I know it's bad timing,
but the business can't wait.

01:07:46.375 --> 01:07:48.374
I guess we don't know each other.

01:07:49.458 --> 01:07:51.249
Oh, sorry.

01:07:52.083 --> 01:07:54.082
This is Mira,

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:57.082
Gawron's widow,

01:07:57.791 --> 01:07:59.415
and this is Ananas, my new partner.

01:07:59.833 --> 01:08:04.999
You're from Ożarów.
You used to work for Wołowina.

01:08:05.166 --> 01:08:07.749
Does it matter?
Now I work on my own.

01:08:08.166 --> 01:08:11.415
- You mean you work with us now?
- Don't fucking interfere.

01:08:11.625 --> 01:08:14.582
- I picked up the frock.
- Show it to mister Ananas.

01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:18.415
I don't give a fuck about your kit. Take the
papers and let's get the fuck out of here.

01:08:18.457 --> 01:08:20.249
We won't be fucking
waiting for her garments.

01:08:20.291 --> 01:08:21.915
Will you let me check the desk?

01:08:22.791 --> 01:08:24.832
And if you could give me the passwords.

01:08:27.832 --> 01:08:29.165
Fuck me.

01:08:31.166 --> 01:08:33.832
What now?
Still making peace with Wołomin?

01:08:34.082 --> 01:08:37.749
We're forgetting about my husband
and it's all fucking right?

01:08:39.207 --> 01:08:42.957
Kowal will provide you with the peace
you didn't even dream about.

01:08:43.957 --> 01:08:45.957
Come on, fuck, it was just a decoy.

01:08:46.707 --> 01:08:49.624
Say one word and I'll off Wołowina.
I'll whack him myself.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.749
I'd have to wait for that
until I'm fucking dead.

01:08:54.166 --> 01:08:55.915
Hycel will off him.

01:08:56.291 --> 01:08:59.999
And you just fucking think.
Where are you?

01:09:00.457 --> 01:09:02.457
With us or in the lime?

01:09:02.791 --> 01:09:04.790
With you. Always with you.

01:09:05.582 --> 01:09:08.999
Say a word and I'll whack
Mona and marry you.

01:09:09.375 --> 01:09:15.999
Kick my kinsman out the door
and help Kowal with this shit.

01:09:33.666 --> 01:09:36.624
Jump in and pass me the stiff.

01:09:44.082 --> 01:09:47.790
- Wait, I'll help you.
- No, take these canisters and torches.

01:09:47.916 --> 01:09:51.874
Is it gas? if we burn him,
it's going to be like a crematory.

01:09:51.957 --> 01:09:53.749
No worries, it's just acid.

01:10:40.875 --> 01:10:44.457
- Have you ever dissolved a guy?
- Nope.

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:47.707
Start from the legs then,
it's less disgusting there.

01:10:49.916 --> 01:10:53.040
Mind your hands 'cause
it's fucking caustic.

01:10:55.708 --> 01:10:57.957
Breathe in and withstand it.

01:10:58.666 --> 01:11:01.624
If you make it without puking,
I'll buy you a whore.

01:11:10.166 --> 01:11:11.999
One more.

01:11:13.041 --> 01:11:15.040
Crap, not a job.

01:11:16.291 --> 01:11:18.290
We should find you something to do.

01:11:21.708 --> 01:11:24.207
Do you want five hundred?
The new note.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.665
- What for? 'Cause, you know...
- No, no way.

01:11:27.708 --> 01:11:31.749
I like to watch ladies on their knees.
Walk a stretch and I'll give you money.

01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:36.707
- How long a stretch?
- Not to Wołomin, just the whole carpet.

01:11:38.458 --> 01:11:39.832
This long?

01:11:40.625 --> 01:11:41.915
Alright.

01:11:59.291 --> 01:12:01.665
- Once more?
- Enough.

01:12:02.666 --> 01:12:04.124
Samanta,

01:12:04.458 --> 01:12:07.457
I'll give you what I have.
Everything.

01:12:09.333 --> 01:12:11.707
4850...

01:12:12.166 --> 01:12:16.082
if you come back to me on all fours,
but underneath the carpet,

01:12:16.208 --> 01:12:18.957
because I hate to watch chicks
walk on their knees.

01:12:20.958 --> 01:12:22.957
4850?

01:12:24.291 --> 01:12:25.832
Alright.

01:12:32.083 --> 01:12:34.082
Motherfuckers.

01:12:34.666 --> 01:12:37.790
They're not from the Teachers' Union.

01:12:38.375 --> 01:12:41.332
- Have you seen "beating the carpet"?
- What?

01:12:56.791 --> 01:12:58.790
Motherfuckers.

01:13:07.208 --> 01:13:11.249
So you're such total badasses?
Then play with me, not the whore.

01:13:11.333 --> 01:13:13.540
Fuck off, lout, or we'll fuck
you up without the carpet.

01:13:13.583 --> 01:13:16.207
We're doing this one on one.
Five of you and two of us.

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:19.790
- What's up? Put your stuff on the bar!
- We don't have anything.

01:13:39.291 --> 01:13:41.290
My stitches came out.

01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:58.665
Be so kind and walk 'til the end,
the hoodlum is waiting to pay you.

01:14:15.458 --> 01:14:19.749
- What makes the smallest profit?
- Nicking from lorries.

01:14:25.791 --> 01:14:27.790
Thanks, Mona, we'll manage.

01:14:31.291 --> 01:14:32.749
And bigger?

01:14:32.916 --> 01:14:37.665
Protection and brothels, kidnappings,
but only done on a massive scale.

01:14:38.166 --> 01:14:40.374
- And the biggest?
- Drugs.

01:14:40.541 --> 01:14:42.540
No. Hycel?

01:14:42.916 --> 01:14:45.207
Robbing the country. VAT.

01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:49.832
But then we're stealing from a thief
with more hitmen than Eastern Europe.

01:14:49.958 --> 01:14:53.457
We'll earn the most
stealing from everybody.

01:14:53.875 --> 01:14:55.582
- A bank.
- You want to rob banks?

01:14:55.625 --> 01:14:57.457
No, moron, I want to build them.

01:15:07.166 --> 01:15:09.457
No more bets, thank you.

01:15:09.666 --> 01:15:11.665
Black seventeen.

01:15:15.583 --> 01:15:17.582
New bets, please.

01:15:26.375 --> 01:15:28.374
Last bets.

01:15:31.416 --> 01:15:33.165
No more bets.

01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:37.707
Black two.

01:15:49.875 --> 01:15:55.457
- Boss, I've got a personal request.
- Speak freely, these are my partners.

01:15:57.208 --> 01:16:00.915
- I need a loan.
- Let's see.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:08.874
I put 111 grand on your tab,
but you're not paying interest.

01:16:09.166 --> 01:16:14.374
It's going to be 159840 zloty now.

01:16:14.666 --> 01:16:16.040
And you want a loan?

01:16:16.083 --> 01:16:19.790
- Adaś, who's your father?
- What does it matter, miss?

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:25.707
I can write you 79940 zloty off,

01:16:26.166 --> 01:16:28.874
lend you 50 grand
and make you a bank's executive.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.999
The salary...

01:16:31.083 --> 01:16:33.207
- How much is the euro now?
- 4.35.

01:16:33.416 --> 01:16:35.415
Say, 43500.

01:16:35.833 --> 01:16:39.207
- My father is a deputy to the Sejm.
- And?

01:16:40.416 --> 01:16:43.165
And a vice-chairman
of the Banking Supervision Authority.

01:16:43.291 --> 01:16:45.832
Because you see,
there's only one problem.

01:16:46.833 --> 01:16:48.332
We don't have this bank yet.

01:17:12.916 --> 01:17:15.957
The Authority motherfuckers
rejected our application.

01:17:17.583 --> 01:17:19.582
I'll kill that turd.

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.207
You'll mess the polish up.

01:17:29.958 --> 01:17:31.665
I already did.

01:17:32.541 --> 01:17:35.874
- Is it gross?
- Not as gross as your husband.

01:17:43.041 --> 01:17:44.540
It's him.

01:17:47.333 --> 01:17:49.332
Jesus...

01:17:51.958 --> 01:17:56.832
- What if he starts to you-know-what?
- He's so stout he doesn't get hard.

01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:59.707
Do you have something
in the glove compartment?

01:18:36.041 --> 01:18:37.374
What happened?

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.457
Drive.

01:18:47.333 --> 01:18:50.082
He doesn't get hard indeed,
but he likes to play with toys.

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:55.707
- What toys?
- A bottle after a Russian rotgut.

01:18:57.166 --> 01:18:59.165
Motherfucker.

01:19:00.416 --> 01:19:01.915
He said he can meet with us.

01:19:01.916 --> 01:19:04.707
But only in his office,
because he won't get eavesdropped on.

01:19:04.833 --> 01:19:09.457
- Should I drive you to a hospital?
- No. Go home.

01:19:19.583 --> 01:19:24.540
We don't have female personnel here.
Grześ, search them.

01:19:31.791 --> 01:19:33.665
Grześ can keep his hands to himself.

01:19:34.916 --> 01:19:37.457
He can search the bag and the coat.

01:19:41.291 --> 01:19:47.082
I don't have a lot of time for you,
but the brat put in a word for you.

01:19:48.125 --> 01:19:54.790
The Supervision Authority's consent
costs one million euros.

01:19:55.166 --> 01:19:57.707
- Can be done.
- Annually.

01:19:57.875 --> 01:20:01.540
To my account in the Cayman Islands.
And I don't want to see you here again.

01:20:01.625 --> 01:20:06.290
It's not really honorable
to have such contractors.

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.249
Eyes on the road.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:33.040
We don't have female personnel here.
Grześ, search them.

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:39.415
What?

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.415
I told you
I don't want to see you again.

01:20:42.666 --> 01:20:49.665
The Supervision Authority's consent
costs one million euros.

01:20:49.791 --> 01:20:51.749
- Can be done.
- Annually.

01:20:52.083 --> 01:20:54.499
- Motherfuckers!
- Are you interested?

01:20:54.541 --> 01:20:58.624
- Or should I send it to Newsweek?
- The ISA will take care of you.

01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:03.207
Shut the fuck up! Bottle-lover.
Or he'll shut it for you.

01:21:03.291 --> 01:21:06.040
What will you look like on TV
without the prosthesis?

01:21:06.708 --> 01:21:09.290
The Authority has a week
to change its decision.

01:21:09.375 --> 01:21:13.957
Bugs finished people
more powerful than you, pig.

01:21:14.125 --> 01:21:16.374
And you're a fucking weak dick.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.207
If you want to stand up to us
or off yourself,

01:21:21.375 --> 01:21:25.457
we will off your kid, broad
and mother in Starowa Góra.

01:21:25.666 --> 01:21:28.207
14 B Starowa Góra next to Łódź.

01:21:28.458 --> 01:21:31.665
Understood?
Let's take a selfie.

01:21:37.083 --> 01:21:38.957
Old one fucking done.

01:21:39.541 --> 01:21:41.415
Cheers to success.

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:46.040
Once you have this bank of yours,

01:21:47.958 --> 01:21:50.707
will we take care of Wołowina?

01:21:51.166 --> 01:21:52.374
Because?

01:21:52.916 --> 01:21:57.707
Because if we don't settle the score,
they'll think we're wussing out.

01:21:59.875 --> 01:22:03.415
Do you know how much bacon
my husband brought home annually?

01:22:04.166 --> 01:22:05.832
You don't?

01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:08.582
25 million.

01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:11.415
You'll see how much we get in the bank.

01:22:12.125 --> 01:22:17.082
Without all these bombs,
pieces, cops sniffing around.

01:22:17.416 --> 01:22:19.415
We'll leave all this crap to Wołomin.

01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:21.749
Brothels, bazaars, drugs.

01:22:21.833 --> 01:22:26.374
We won't be smuggling heating oil
and peddle it as diesel oil.

01:22:27.125 --> 01:22:31.499
In 10 years we'll buy ourselves
a gas pipeline, get it?

01:22:31.666 --> 01:22:36.249
And you want to give it all to Wołomin
because they offed your husband?

01:22:37.708 --> 01:22:41.874
- How do you know it was them?
- 'Cause Obuch tried to off us, and...

01:22:44.291 --> 01:22:46.665
True, I don't know for sure.

01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:51.332
- We'd have to find out.
- Find out then.

01:22:52.125 --> 01:22:55.457
Have you seen the one who put
an iron to your head before?

01:22:56.333 --> 01:22:59.415
No, where would I?
Why are you asking?

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:02.332
You told me to find out,
so I need to ask around.

01:23:13.583 --> 01:23:15.582
It's taken, can't you see?

01:23:17.041 --> 01:23:20.207
- What are you doing here?
- I came to talk.

01:23:20.291 --> 01:23:24.499
Give Mira and Junior my condolences.
I'd do it, but it'd be inappropriate.

01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:27.124
Rather inappropriate for you to do it.

01:23:27.666 --> 01:23:32.332
Do you think I'd be here with a chick
if I'd ordered to whack him?

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.999
I'm not a "chick"!

01:23:36.333 --> 01:23:39.249
True, I guess.
What happened with Obuch and Lalunia?

01:23:40.375 --> 01:23:43.040
Lalunia conspired with Junior
and this I know for sure.

01:23:43.083 --> 01:23:47.082
See, Kowal, it was Lalunia,
and you said it was Obuch.

01:23:47.208 --> 01:23:49.874
I didn't talk to Obuch myself.
It was Junior's idea.

01:23:50.375 --> 01:23:51.832
I know nothing about Lalunia.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.332
- Junior? How?
- Yeah, him.

01:23:56.916 --> 01:24:00.290
- Where do you know Mountain from?
- I don't know the guy.

01:24:00.375 --> 01:24:02.957
I heard a thing or two,
but I don't run with kiddie killers.

01:24:03.375 --> 01:24:06.249
- Where can I find him?
- I don't know.

01:24:08.708 --> 01:24:11.332
- Unless I hear something by chance.
- Listen.

01:24:11.625 --> 01:24:16.582
We're entering the banking sector.
Mira wants to sell you everything.

01:24:16.875 --> 01:24:18.207
Sell how?

01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:22.124
- Our turf, guys, contacts.
- For free?

01:24:22.375 --> 01:24:25.374
For a lifetime protection,
but we need a guarantee.

01:24:26.791 --> 01:24:29.165
I won't give you my mother
but I can give you the old man.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.540
- The old man? Your father?
- Yeah, my father.

01:24:33.375 --> 01:24:36.999
If I fuck up, you'll whack him,
but I won't, so he's covered.

01:24:37.416 --> 01:24:39.415
Set up a meeting with Mira.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Good morning.

01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:15.957
God bless you, Bishop.
Welcome.

01:25:18.416 --> 01:25:19.832
The door!

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:23.290
There you go.

01:25:23.541 --> 01:25:31.290
- I wanted to open an account.
- Of course. 2085 zloty.

01:25:35.208 --> 01:25:38.665
This coin goes to our vault
and secures your deposit.

01:25:38.833 --> 01:25:43.415
- Just 65% of the coin, to be exact.
- I'll pay the rest then...

01:25:44.333 --> 01:25:45.874
Of course.

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:59.207
I hope the curia's money
will be safe here, Bishop.

01:26:03.291 --> 01:26:05.499
- Thank you very much, goodbye.
- Thank you.

01:26:05.916 --> 01:26:09.082
- Good morning.
- I'd like to open an account.

01:26:09.291 --> 01:26:10.332
Your ID, please.

01:26:14.791 --> 01:26:17.124
- Chairwoman.
- Executive.

01:26:17.166 --> 01:26:19.415
- What's up, mate?
- Assets.

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:24.165
Well done. Ask your father's friends
if they want to be branch executives.

01:26:24.333 --> 01:26:27.540
- In Poznań, Kraków and Wrocław.
- Skills?

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:29.749
Same as yours. Or better.

01:26:29.833 --> 01:26:33.832
- Oh fuck.
- What? Something's wrong?

01:26:33.958 --> 01:26:37.082
This place is packed to the rafters.
When are we closing?

01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:42.290
- In 15 minutes. At 6.
- I'll go have a smoke outside.

01:26:43.875 --> 01:26:48.624
- Don't push!
- How long can we wait?

01:26:51.083 --> 01:26:53.290
- Move, please.
- Let me go!

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:57.374
- Excuse me.
- I've been standing here for ages!

01:26:59.083 --> 01:27:00.415
Excuse me.

01:27:09.041 --> 01:27:12.832
Go fuck yourself!
We agreed to stay out of touch.

01:27:13.125 --> 01:27:15.374
- Will fish me out of the Vistula?
- What's your problem?

01:27:15.458 --> 01:27:19.874
- It was you who approached me.
- And who came to the bank?

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.957
What bank?
I'm here of my own accord.

01:27:24.250 --> 01:27:27.999
They have a good pension offer.

01:27:28.583 --> 01:27:34.749
In Argentina, for fuck's sake.
It's a Ponzi scheme, don't you get it?

01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:36.915
Do you know what's the CEO's name?

01:27:37.125 --> 01:27:39.457
Fucking Gawrońska.
It's our bank.

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:43.207
But they praise it on TV,
advertise it all the time.

01:27:45.250 --> 01:27:50.790
- I have to go withdraw the money.
- Wait. Not now and not in this branch.

01:27:50.958 --> 01:27:54.124
Go tomorrow.
To Łódź or Tricity.

01:27:54.791 --> 01:27:58.249
An offer for officers?
Old fool.

01:27:59.250 --> 01:28:00.832
There's no Hycel.

01:28:01.875 --> 01:28:03.082
What?

01:28:03.166 --> 01:28:09.124
I've never seen a bandit
looking so alike an officer.

01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:13.165
- I don't know what you mean.
- You do.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.999
There's no Wółkowski.

01:28:18.666 --> 01:28:21.207
You've been working as Hycel
from the very beginning.

01:28:21.458 --> 01:28:27.457
The policeman was hit by a drunk priest
and they only added it to the legend.

01:28:28.958 --> 01:28:31.749
So many years for the Russkis.

01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:37.832
- Who's a fool now, Despero?
- I didn't work for the Russkis.

01:28:38.166 --> 01:28:40.540
- It was the Interpol's operation.
- I don't have to know.

01:28:40.666 --> 01:28:45.540
- Why did Goebbels want to frame you?
- Drugs.

01:28:48.291 --> 01:28:50.290
I was a whore.

01:28:51.166 --> 01:28:53.165
I know what it's like.

01:28:56.041 --> 01:29:00.249
What now?
Goebbels trusted me and you don't?

01:29:06.208 --> 01:29:09.582
According to my knowledge,
Wołomin didn't hire Mountain either.

01:29:10.708 --> 01:29:12.499
Who did then?

01:29:13.333 --> 01:29:15.082
I don't know.

01:29:24.666 --> 01:29:26.906
- Where's the chairwoman?
- At the accounting department.

01:29:26.958 --> 01:29:30.749
- The vice went out for a business swag.
- A business swag? Okay.

01:29:48.875 --> 01:29:52.249
Thank you, it's all for today.
You'll finish it tomorrow.

01:29:55.375 --> 01:29:58.957
Pull the pants up, sort yourself out.
There are cleaners on the stairs.

01:29:59.041 --> 01:30:01.832
I go in and you jump out like this?
What's it gonna look like?

01:30:01.875 --> 01:30:05.207
- I'm very sorry.
- Don't apologize. Get the fuck out.

01:30:11.541 --> 01:30:14.124
- Do you want to finish?
- The line or you?

01:30:14.833 --> 01:30:16.832
The line's already out.

01:30:17.916 --> 01:30:20.374
Aren't you afraid
I'll rat you out to Junior?

01:30:22.958 --> 01:30:25.790
Are you going to rat out
that you sent me to this fat pig too?

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.415
- You're high. We'll talk tomorrow.
- Asshole! Hosebag!

01:30:40.833 --> 01:30:42.832
I keep thinking, but I don't know.

01:30:43.041 --> 01:30:46.165
Why did you let the crowd
onto the dancefloor in Olsztyn?

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:49.040
- What?
- Should I repeat?

01:30:51.041 --> 01:30:54.457
- Mira let the guests in too.
- I personally forbade you to.

01:30:54.708 --> 01:30:56.707
Fuck off.

01:30:58.083 --> 01:31:00.082
Fuck, you mad, asshole?

01:31:00.541 --> 01:31:03.249
I'll tell Junior to off you for that.

01:31:04.666 --> 01:31:07.874
- Listen to me!
- Let me go!

01:31:07.958 --> 01:31:10.332
It won't stop itself
after all you've sniffed.

01:31:10.416 --> 01:31:14.790
You'll bleed out like a sow
and they'll presume it's the drugs.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.749
- Why did you do that?
- Let me go, you moron!

01:31:19.041 --> 01:31:22.415
- I wanted to have fun!
- Why?!

01:31:22.625 --> 01:31:28.082
I already told you.
I feel faint. Let me go. No!

01:31:28.125 --> 01:31:32.749
- Why the fuck?!
- My husband told me to.

01:31:57.541 --> 01:32:01.082
Hycel, let's go home.

01:32:32.416 --> 01:32:35.874
- What the fuck are you doing?
- How will I find Mountain?

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.082
- Hide the piece...
- You sent a thug to off your brother?

01:32:41.541 --> 01:32:45.499
You're not worthy of shooting.
Just a rope and a tow hook.

01:32:45.708 --> 01:32:50.457
Lucky you. I need access to Mountain.
Tell me where I'll find him.

01:32:51.166 --> 01:32:55.040
- You're getting something wrong.
- Open the window behind you.

01:32:55.958 --> 01:32:59.040
- What?
- I don't want to make a mess.

01:32:59.333 --> 01:33:02.290
- Hycel...
- Open the window, you fucker!

01:33:04.083 --> 01:33:05.790
Do you know who I am?

01:33:06.208 --> 01:33:07.624
How many guys did you see me whack?

01:33:07.666 --> 01:33:11.040
- The waiter and Lalunia.
- How many else have you heard of?

01:33:11.625 --> 01:33:15.749
- Four cops.
- Six in total. I'm counting.

01:33:16.208 --> 01:33:19.707
It wasn't me.
How could I?

01:33:19.833 --> 01:33:22.165
- Five...
- Wołomin sent them.

01:33:22.208 --> 01:33:23.957
- Four...
- I swear on my mother.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.332
- Three... Two... One...
- I have his number, fuck, don't shoot!

01:33:45.625 --> 01:33:48.999
- Yeah?
- We've got things to fix in Masuria.

01:33:49.916 --> 01:33:51.290
Five.

01:33:51.958 --> 01:33:55.374
Tomorrow at 11 am
in the shoe trees stall.

01:34:00.333 --> 01:34:04.749
His uncle sells shoe trees at a bazaar.

01:34:05.875 --> 01:34:08.707
I am to bring him
5 thousand euros at 11 am.

01:34:12.708 --> 01:34:13.915
What now?

01:34:13.958 --> 01:34:17.249
You wanted Gawron to think
that Wołomin is going to war with him.

01:34:17.708 --> 01:34:20.249
How many more orders
did you have for Mountain?

01:34:21.458 --> 01:34:23.374
Just Olsztyn.

01:34:24.416 --> 01:34:26.415
But I had to take a hit this time.

01:34:27.708 --> 01:34:29.707
So I shot myself.

01:34:31.625 --> 01:34:33.249
Come on, fuck,
don't you believe me?

01:34:33.291 --> 01:34:36.165
I admitted to killing my brother,
would I bullshit about the others?

01:34:38.916 --> 01:34:40.665
True, I guess.

01:35:00.125 --> 01:35:02.999
- To solitary, huh?
- I'll take him to the spooks.

01:35:08.541 --> 01:35:13.082
We're taking Mountain out at 11 am.
Shoe tree stall at the bazaar.

01:35:13.166 --> 01:35:16.124
The CTs in a refrigerated truck
will wait there the whole night.

01:35:16.208 --> 01:35:19.832
Just make it logical,
not a furniture van next to a grocery.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.624
Leave it to me.
Worry about your story for the gangstas.

01:35:25.458 --> 01:35:28.957
I drove him to the station,
but I don't know if he got on.

01:35:29.041 --> 01:35:31.040
- And?
- That's it.

01:35:31.666 --> 01:35:34.207
- Did he say when he'll come back?
- He never tells me anything.

01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:35.749
How's the business going?

01:35:35.958 --> 01:35:39.332
We're opening branches
in 11 voivodeships next month.

01:35:40.666 --> 01:35:43.040
We'll exceed a billion
by the end of the month.

01:35:44.083 --> 01:35:45.999
Did you set up a meeting with Wołowina?

01:35:46.125 --> 01:35:48.165
Saturday, an unused motel in Łomianki.

01:35:48.291 --> 01:35:50.165
Four from each side.

01:35:50.291 --> 01:35:52.999
If Junior doesn't come back,
there's only me, you and Kowal.

01:35:54.125 --> 01:35:56.124
Why wouldn't he come back?

01:36:02.916 --> 01:36:05.040
Fuck.
I asked you.

01:36:05.125 --> 01:36:07.290
FURNITURE
There was nothing else left yesterday.

01:36:07.458 --> 01:36:09.707
Easy, in order to see it
he has to come here, right?

01:36:11.250 --> 01:36:15.207
- Won't these guards scare him off?
- These guards are ours.

01:36:20.333 --> 01:36:22.249
- Do you have a trade permit?
- Yes.

01:36:22.291 --> 01:36:24.290
- Can I see it?
- Yes, please.

01:36:24.416 --> 01:36:28.957
The target is walking your way.
Green coat, black hat. Small, thin guy.

01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:31.749
We're taking him.

01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:36.457
Police! Get down! Freeze!

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:38.374
The vest got it. Get him!

01:36:39.083 --> 01:36:41.999
Freeze! Police!

01:36:47.708 --> 01:36:49.124
Freeze! Police!

01:36:51.333 --> 01:36:53.540
Freeze! Get down! Police!

01:36:56.666 --> 01:36:58.665
Wait, wait!

01:37:23.916 --> 01:37:25.374
Fuck!

01:37:50.916 --> 01:37:53.665
Where are they?
Shoot in the legs!

01:37:55.041 --> 01:37:56.707
Don't shoot!

01:37:59.583 --> 01:38:02.707
- Is that how you approach an armed guy?
- Let it go!

01:38:03.916 --> 01:38:09.040
- Did Junior blow my cover?
- Yes. Tell me...

01:38:09.375 --> 01:38:11.124
Fuck the rat.

01:38:11.291 --> 01:38:15.999
It was me who whacked his brother
at his direct personal order.

01:38:16.041 --> 01:38:18.082
He gave me five grand.
Did the cops hear?

01:38:18.166 --> 01:38:19.957
They did, they did!

01:38:20.083 --> 01:38:24.082
Testify more for me.
Did Junior pay you for Soczek?

01:38:24.208 --> 01:38:25.499
What?

01:38:25.916 --> 01:38:29.624
I know you offed an officer
like half a year ago.

01:38:29.833 --> 01:38:32.332
- Was it at Junior's command?
- No.

01:38:32.416 --> 01:38:37.707
- Whose then? Fuck, Mountain!
- I'm not a rat, you pig.

01:38:38.833 --> 01:38:42.707
- Is the ambulance here?
- It's coming, but that's the end.

01:38:44.541 --> 01:38:47.665
- Did he testify?
- He offed Gawron at Junior's command.

01:38:47.833 --> 01:38:51.165
The CTs witnessed this,
but he didn't admit to whacking Soczek.

01:38:55.958 --> 01:38:57.582
Hi there, Kowal, what's up?

01:38:57.875 --> 01:39:01.499
I'm driving around looking for him.

01:39:01.708 --> 01:39:06.457
A shootout at the bazaar?
I didn't hear it. I'll be there soon.

01:39:06.833 --> 01:39:11.874
- Gotta go.
- Don't go back. Mountain's done.

01:39:12.125 --> 01:39:14.332
Don't inform the station yet.

01:39:14.416 --> 01:39:17.957
The widow wants to deal with Wołomin.
It'd be better if I was there.

01:39:18.125 --> 01:39:20.582
You have to come back one day.

01:39:43.458 --> 01:39:47.207
- What are you doing here?
- Mira invited us.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.082
Are you Hycel?
Mahmud. Hi.

01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:02.624
I'm glad you're here.

01:40:02.708 --> 01:40:05.374
- Deputy has problems with the police.
- Everybody does.

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:11.207
He'll send all his guys after me.

01:40:11.333 --> 01:40:16.332
I won't be covering for you anymore.
I want my part and I'm leaving.

01:40:16.583 --> 01:40:20.457
- Leaving far away. Today!
- Who said so?

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.624
- The commissioner.
- Metropolitan?

01:40:22.666 --> 01:40:25.249
Of course not! Chief!

01:40:26.666 --> 01:40:34.249
Let's say I'll give you five.
Or ten. And you'll go to Israel.

01:40:34.375 --> 01:40:38.374
How long will it last?
Please, give us time until Monday.

01:40:39.791 --> 01:40:41.790
You may come in handy in the future.

01:40:42.541 --> 01:40:45.665
Will you walk the deputy to the car?

01:40:51.041 --> 01:40:54.165
- Will you off him?
- Who?

01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:56.749
The main cop of all the cops.

01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:00.499
- Alright.
- No, you hesitated.

01:41:00.583 --> 01:41:02.957
- I didn't.
- It's not for someone who hesitates.

01:41:03.041 --> 01:41:06.124
Maybe I thought for a moment,
but it's not just any patrolman,

01:41:06.333 --> 01:41:08.957
it's a fucking police commissioner
for the whole fucking country.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.124
Alright, subject discussed.
Somebody else will do it.

01:41:11.166 --> 01:41:13.165
Who? The Chechens?

01:41:13.583 --> 01:41:16.624
Maybe.
Go take care of our guests with Kowal.

01:41:16.833 --> 01:41:19.082
Do you remember we have a
meeting with Wołomin tomorrow?

01:41:19.166 --> 01:41:21.249
Why do you think these wogs came here?

01:41:24.541 --> 01:41:28.457
- Enough. We won't stay up all night!
- He told me it was urgent.

01:41:28.541 --> 01:41:33.165
The operation was to end a month ago.
That's insubordination.

01:41:33.250 --> 01:41:35.832
- He said it was urgent.
- Where is he then?

01:41:42.541 --> 01:41:45.999
- Where have you been? I smell alcohol.
- At work.

01:41:46.125 --> 01:41:49.999
- Have you been drinking?
- I had to, but I'm still conscious.

01:41:50.416 --> 01:41:52.415
The meeting's cancelled.

01:41:53.416 --> 01:41:56.499
I'm closing down the operation.

01:41:57.166 --> 01:42:01.749
We'll talk tomorrow, when you sober up.
9am in my office. Done!

01:42:01.791 --> 01:42:04.624
- They want to off the commissioner.
- Me?

01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:05.874
No. Your boss.

01:43:41.125 --> 01:43:42.332
Evacuate, evacuate!

01:43:42.458 --> 01:43:46.624
- What the fuck is he doing?
- They're ceasing the operation.

01:43:46.958 --> 01:43:48.499
Get in the cars.

01:43:50.625 --> 01:43:52.957
- Have you gone fucking mad?
- The operation's cancelled.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.707
- What happened?
- They killed the main one at night.

01:43:55.791 --> 01:43:57.790
- Who gave the order?
- The metropolitan.

01:43:57.875 --> 01:44:02.290
- Get out as fast as possible.
- Fucking fuck.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.707
- There's nobody here.
- What?

01:44:14.791 --> 01:44:17.790
- No witnesses. Nobody saw them.
- So what?

01:44:18.125 --> 01:44:21.249
- We can continue.
- The three of us?

01:44:21.416 --> 01:44:23.915
- We'll call our friends.
- You mean who?

01:44:24.125 --> 01:44:26.124
Our mates.

01:44:27.541 --> 01:44:30.040
We're all here.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.665
The widow and the Chechens
will slaughter these guys from Wołomin.

01:44:36.708 --> 01:44:39.415
- Better them than us, isn't it?
- Right.

01:44:41.250 --> 01:44:45.415
Do you think they'll surrender
when they see us?

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:48.874
- We'll have to shoot!
- So we'll shoot.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:58.249
At best we'll have to kill them all.
Is that the plan?

01:44:58.416 --> 01:45:00.415
That's our job, isn't it?

01:45:00.666 --> 01:45:02.665
We can do it, they can't.

01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:15.832
- How many will there be?
- Six and probably Kowal.

01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:18.249
I'll try the CTs again.

01:45:19.666 --> 01:45:24.124
Barszczyk? if you don't send CTs,
there's going to be a bloodbath.

01:45:24.583 --> 01:45:27.082
No, we're not going back,
we're in the middle of...

01:45:27.625 --> 01:45:30.207
- The motherfucker hung up.
- Alright, let's go to work.

01:45:30.375 --> 01:45:33.624
Before Wołomin comes,
'cause we won't count them then.

01:45:34.125 --> 01:45:37.999
- Seven to three, what do we do?
- As usual, we'll ask them to surrender.

01:46:29.458 --> 01:46:31.457
Careful.
They'll be here soon.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.999
I'm entering the dance hall.

01:47:04.625 --> 01:47:06.457
Police! Hands up!

01:47:23.791 --> 01:47:25.790
Two down.

01:47:43.166 --> 01:47:46.665
- Will you manage?
- Take Kowal. It's just my arm.

01:49:24.583 --> 01:49:27.999
Police!
Drop your weapon and get down!

01:49:28.375 --> 01:49:30.374
Your buddies are dead!

01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:32.582
You haven't killed anyone yet!

01:49:33.208 --> 01:49:35.915
Five years in prison
are better than death!

01:49:42.666 --> 01:49:46.540
You're a soldier, but not a fool.

01:49:46.833 --> 01:49:50.749
You're not a bandit.
You're smart!

01:49:51.250 --> 01:49:55.957
You're only doing it for the money,
but there will be nothing but death!

01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:05.207
Fuck, get down!
Hands on your head!

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.749
Fuck, Hycel?

01:50:58.916 --> 01:51:01.415
Call an ambulance to the pool, now!

01:51:05.666 --> 01:51:08.790
- Fuck, Hycel, you're a cop?
- Yeah, I am.

01:51:09.125 --> 01:51:13.707
Don't say anything.
You'll be in hospital soon.

01:51:15.583 --> 01:51:18.415
- But a cop, Hycel?
- I'm not Hycel.

01:51:18.875 --> 01:51:20.874
I'm Despero
from the counter-terrorist squad.

01:51:22.458 --> 01:51:24.040
That's good.

01:51:25.458 --> 01:51:29.540
I was worried you're a rat,

01:51:30.166 --> 01:51:33.082
but you're just a cop.

01:51:39.416 --> 01:51:41.415
Hold on, Kowal.

01:51:47.250 --> 01:51:50.165
Carry them
if you don't want to fight with Wołomin.

01:52:24.875 --> 01:52:30.457
In Warsaw today there was a shootout
with handguns.

01:52:30.625 --> 01:52:38.040
An unidentified man or men fired
in the direction of a Skoda car.

01:52:38.125 --> 01:52:42.165
An identical car is owned by the chief
police commissioner, General Mateusz Z.,

01:52:42.250 --> 01:52:43.250
Give me some smokes.

01:52:43.333 --> 01:52:45.207
Who lives nearby the crime scene.

01:52:45.291 --> 01:52:47.915
Do you know that there are
more cops killed than bad guys?

01:52:49.375 --> 01:52:52.082
Don't get involved with a cop
or you'll become a widower.

01:52:52.125 --> 01:52:54.290
He's been taken to the
intensive care unit.

01:52:54.333 --> 01:52:57.457
And you - with a gangster,
or you'll become a Jane Doe or a widow.

01:52:57.625 --> 01:53:03.915
I've been with a bad guy for 6 months.
With a cop, I was a widow after two.

01:53:05.083 --> 01:53:09.457
- You got hitched with a cop?
- I was supposed to get hitched.

01:53:10.083 --> 01:53:12.082
They killed him before the wedding.

01:53:13.375 --> 01:53:15.165
Blew him up with a bomb.

01:53:15.291 --> 01:53:18.332
- A bomb? What was his name?
- Jarek.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.999
But they called him Soczek.

01:53:21.125 --> 01:53:23.290
- He was so sweet.
- Soczek who?

01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:26.582
- The one with a pregnant wife?
- He wanted to throw her over.

01:53:27.541 --> 01:53:32.207
He worried about the kid.
The bitch said she'd rather drown it.

01:53:33.250 --> 01:53:35.832
We fell in love, what could we do?

01:53:43.333 --> 01:53:45.332
Why were Majami and Soczek
such good buddies?

01:53:45.375 --> 01:53:48.915
- They both dated gangstas' ex-chicks.
- Exactly.

01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:57.332
Check the thug who dated Soczek's widow
before she became his chick.

01:53:57.541 --> 01:53:59.332
- Now?
- Now.

01:54:05.083 --> 01:54:10.499
Check Soczek's widow and see
what's her ex's from Ożarów name is.

01:54:10.625 --> 01:54:12.499
Yes, now.
I'm waiting.

01:54:22.375 --> 01:54:23.957
Yeah?

01:54:25.958 --> 01:54:27.499
Okay, thanks.

01:54:28.125 --> 01:54:30.874
Piórkowski Stanisław, alias Władek.

01:54:33.875 --> 01:54:38.332
Mountain was in jail with him
for the last four years. In one cell.

01:54:43.875 --> 01:54:46.374
Don't fuck with me, not for this price.

01:54:46.875 --> 01:54:48.874
He has to come down 20%.

01:54:49.583 --> 01:54:51.582
I gotta go, I've got a guest.

01:54:55.875 --> 01:54:58.415
Do you have any news for me?

01:55:09.583 --> 01:55:12.540
- When are you due?
- In 10 days.

01:55:13.666 --> 01:55:14.915
Listen to me.

01:55:16.416 --> 01:55:21.999
We can't prove anything to you,
because Mountain is dead.

01:55:22.166 --> 01:55:28.749
Just tell me: how could you
order to kill your child's father?

01:55:28.833 --> 01:55:29.999
What!?

01:55:30.083 --> 01:55:32.790
You're giving birth in 10 days

01:55:34.791 --> 01:55:39.915
and you ordered a thug to off him.
Your husband.

01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:44.790
How will you look the kid in the eye?
How will you raise it?

01:55:44.875 --> 01:55:48.707
- Are you sick or what?
- And you're healthy?

01:55:50.833 --> 01:55:58.833
I've seen many things,
but killing a husband and father...

01:56:00.708 --> 01:56:07.915
it's going to remind you every hour
that you ordered to kill his father.

01:56:08.083 --> 01:56:10.915
Are you going to put it in a barrel too?

01:56:12.333 --> 01:56:14.332
What's happening?

01:56:15.375 --> 01:56:18.624
Nitro in my pocket and an ambulance.

01:56:32.041 --> 01:56:34.207
He promised me everything,
and when I got pregnant,

01:56:34.250 --> 01:56:41.207
he wanted to throw me over
for a whore with young tits and ass.

01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:44.540
Neither me nor my damn brat mattered.

01:56:45.708 --> 01:56:47.624
You want nitroglycerin?

01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:51.624
Die, fucker.

01:57:34.625 --> 01:57:36.624
Wait, I'll help you.

01:57:37.791 --> 01:57:39.790
As you wish.

01:57:41.583 --> 01:57:45.249
I've got 42 suitcases of dollars

01:57:47.125 --> 01:57:49.749
and a ticket to Israel.
We can buy a second one at the airport.

01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:53.249
Yeah, true.

01:57:55.666 --> 01:58:00.749
If you don't like Jews or the climate,
I can send you a few.

01:58:00.875 --> 01:58:02.582
You probably can.

01:58:03.666 --> 01:58:08.707
- We're alone. It's just us.
- You don't even know how alone.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.665
Maybe we'd fall in love with time.

01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:17.832
Maybe,

01:58:18.708 --> 01:58:20.707
if you'd hesitated at least once.

01:58:58.166 --> 01:59:00.957
- Keep an eye on my van.
- What do you have inside?

02:03:52.458 --> 02:03:55.457
