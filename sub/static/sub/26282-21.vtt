"The Resident"...

00:02.097 --> 00:05.158
- First husband.
- You mean, best husband?

00:06.276 --> 00:08.457
I got to say,
my new assistant was right.

00:08.545 --> 00:09.625
I'm proud of him.

00:09.713 --> 00:10.715
He's a good son.

00:10.803 --> 00:12.712
That scotch is from my mom.
She and my dad

00:12.800 --> 00:14.363
crossed paths
and reignited their spark.

00:14.451 --> 00:16.379
The greatest betrayal
of Austin's life

00:16.467 --> 00:18.316
was when his birth parents
abandoned him.

00:18.416 --> 00:20.152
Threw him away like trash.

00:20.558 --> 00:23.800
At work, we go back to
what we always were, friends.

00:26.391 --> 00:29.174
- NIC: Her kidneys are failing.
- KYLE: This time I'm here.

00:29.262 --> 00:31.832
For her. For you.

00:33.294 --> 00:36.879
- Here we go.
- Bring it on. Mm. Uh...

00:37.074 --> 00:39.160
J-Jelly... octopus. Octopus.

00:39.248 --> 00:40.285
Looks like a mouse to me.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.191
Oh, come on, guys.
It's an elephant.

00:42.471 --> 00:44.519
Respect the trunk.

00:44.607 --> 00:45.935
(chuckles)

00:46.034 --> 00:47.846
Okay. I see it there.

00:47.934 --> 00:49.324
Wait, who was that?

00:49.871 --> 00:51.363
Work.

00:51.784 --> 00:53.605
You need to calm down.
I promise

00:53.693 --> 00:55.019
I will tell you
the second I hear

00:55.074 --> 00:56.621
from the transplant coordinator.

00:56.708 --> 00:59.048
Okay. It's just that
they called me 24 hours

00:59.136 --> 01:00.472
after my first blood test, so...

01:00.574 --> 01:02.028
- Nic, his test was yesterday.
- All right?

01:02.115 --> 01:04.227
Like the man said, calm down.

01:04.315 --> 01:05.556
KYLE:
That's my girl.

01:05.644 --> 01:08.386
Look, I'm Jessie's father.

01:08.487 --> 01:10.068
I will be a match,

01:10.156 --> 01:12.081
and I will donate
my kidney to her.

01:12.169 --> 01:14.130
Well, I'm already scheduled for
my second round of testing,

01:14.217 --> 01:15.531
just in case, so...

01:15.886 --> 01:17.712
I just wish neither of you
had to do this.

01:17.800 --> 01:21.680
I know, honey.
But in good news,

01:22.214 --> 01:24.903
you have two shots
at a new kidney.

01:51.074 --> 01:52.811
Come on.
Come on, you're onto something.

01:52.898 --> 01:54.862
Come on.
Come on, come on.

01:54.950 --> 01:57.081
- Come on.

CONRAD:
I found our guy!

02:09.183 --> 02:11.243
Found our guy.
About a hundred yards

02:11.331 --> 02:12.970
northwest of where
the river bends.

02:13.058 --> 02:15.066
WOMAN (over radio):
<i>Copy that. Air unit en route.</i>

02:19.925 --> 02:21.964
Fritz. Hey.

02:22.269 --> 02:24.260
You're gonna be all right, huh?

02:24.527 --> 02:25.909
Fritz...

02:26.346 --> 02:28.048
I got you.

02:28.355 --> 02:30.219
WOMAN:
...<i>County Search and Rescue.</i>

02:30.323 --> 02:33.275
<i>Update on the information that
the sheriff has been notified.</i>

02:33.363 --> 02:35.276
My name is Dr. Conrad Hawkins.
You know what day it is?

02:35.363 --> 02:36.628
How'd you find me?

02:36.716 --> 02:38.966
Your friends called
Georgia Search and Rescue.

02:39.054 --> 02:43.191
- I'm a volunteer.
- I got lost. My friends.

02:43.279 --> 02:45.795
Well, I got you now.
You're safe.

02:46.581 --> 02:49.009
He's alive. We're gonna need
to fly him out of here.

02:49.183 --> 02:52.777
Hang with me.
We're gonna get you to Chastain.

03:09.469 --> 03:13.720
21-year-old male lost in
the wilderness for 72 hours!

03:13.808 --> 03:15.486
IRVING:
Let's get him to bay seven.

03:15.574 --> 03:16.361
I thought you were off today.

03:16.448 --> 03:18.730
I am. Picked up an extra
volunteer day.

03:18.817 --> 03:20.565
Glutton for punishment.

03:20.652 --> 03:22.134
And why were you out there,
my friend?

03:22.221 --> 03:24.384
I asked my fraternity brothers
to go camping.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.261
Figured we'd throw rocks
at trees.

03:26.349 --> 03:28.050
Drink beer.
Forget about the world.

03:28.138 --> 03:30.206
One, two, three!

03:31.163 --> 03:33.812
Instead, they turned it into
this messed up intervention.

03:33.899 --> 03:36.087
- They were mad at me.
- Why?

03:36.175 --> 03:37.916
Because I started dating
Jonathan.

03:38.003 --> 03:39.151
(Fritz groans)

03:39.238 --> 03:40.319
All right. Relax.

03:40.406 --> 03:43.456
- (groans)
- Relax. Relax. Just breathe.

03:43.550 --> 03:45.324
He took a fall, he's hypotensive

03:45.411 --> 03:47.159
and severely dehydrated. I gave
him two liters of normal saline

03:47.246 --> 03:48.548
in the chopper.

03:48.636 --> 03:50.762
IRVING:
This is why God invented hotels.

03:50.849 --> 03:53.589
Nobody needs to sleep outside.
Ever.

03:54.128 --> 03:56.000
Gave him a Chem 8 en route.

03:56.269 --> 03:58.470
His hemoglobin's 6.5.

03:58.644 --> 04:01.005
Why is he so anemic? I'm only
seeing cuts and scrapes.

04:01.092 --> 04:02.507
CONRAD:
Could be bleeding internally.

04:02.594 --> 04:04.509
- (groans)
- Type and cross him for four units of blood

04:04.596 --> 04:05.986
and let's get him to CT.

04:06.074 --> 04:08.280
What, haven't you heard?
Chastain's almost out of blood.

04:08.367 --> 04:09.981
There's only a few units left
in the whole hospital.

04:10.068 --> 04:11.706
Get whatever you can.

04:12.244 --> 04:14.112
He's gonna need it.

04:15.386 --> 04:18.123
DEVON: How is it possible
that Chastain is out of blood?

04:18.209 --> 04:20.091
MINA: Last night there were
car pileups, stabbings,

04:20.178 --> 04:22.461
and more than the usual amount
of gunshot wounds.

04:22.548 --> 04:24.529
Well, why don't we just get some
from another hospital?

04:24.616 --> 04:26.131
There's a national shortage.

04:26.218 --> 04:27.766
Happens a lot. I'm no help.

04:27.853 --> 04:29.783
I donated last month
and you have to wait 56 days.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.993
I'm out, too. Conrad and I
donated together last week.

04:33.081 --> 04:34.339
It wouldn't help today, anyway.

04:34.426 --> 04:37.128
It takes at least 24 hours
to test and process blood.

04:38.839 --> 04:41.113
Who is that with Dr. Austin?

04:41.714 --> 04:42.647
I don't know her.

04:42.734 --> 04:44.980
(chuckles)
Well, he certainly does.

04:45.150 --> 04:46.351
(chuckles)

04:49.150 --> 04:50.870
Well, that's a big improvement.

04:51.112 --> 04:53.486
Way too long bored off your ass
in a hospital

04:53.574 --> 04:54.893
will do that for you.

04:54.980 --> 04:58.330
No. A necessary surgery
for a pheo

04:58.417 --> 05:00.532
and an aneurysm
will do that for you.

05:00.619 --> 05:02.467
When are we supposed
to let you out of here?

05:02.554 --> 05:05.337
Tomorrow. Can't wait.

05:05.424 --> 05:07.005
I already missed the Braves'
spring training

05:07.092 --> 05:08.207
and the season opener.

05:08.294 --> 05:10.342
Ugh, you and your sports.

05:10.429 --> 05:14.683
Uh, I can't miss another game
in their VIP suite.

05:14.808 --> 05:17.081
The Braves' VIP suite?

05:17.316 --> 05:18.673
That's an upgrade.

05:18.839 --> 05:20.648
When we were married,
you could barely see the game

05:20.735 --> 05:21.820
from our seats.

05:21.907 --> 05:23.988
"Is that it there?
That tiny green square?"

05:24.075 --> 05:25.590
I'm telling you,

05:25.677 --> 05:27.103
you'd like it now.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.853
Champagne...

05:29.010 --> 05:31.345
an outdoor patio with servers

05:31.450 --> 05:36.021
who bring food
right to your face.

05:38.384 --> 05:40.470
Come with me this weekend.

05:43.103 --> 05:45.798
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.454
But it might be.

05:48.899 --> 05:52.009
You're not wrong.
It might be.

05:52.638 --> 05:55.053
(pager vibrates)

05:55.140 --> 05:57.108
All right.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.731
Doing okay, Fritz?

06:06.954 --> 06:09.001
How did I end up here?

06:09.388 --> 06:12.271
I started off the school year
in our fraternity house.

06:12.649 --> 06:14.897
I'm an orphan, no family.

06:14.985 --> 06:18.056
- Those guys were my family.
- Well, that sounds pretty great.

06:18.204 --> 06:21.112
- We all need to find our people.
- They were awesome.

06:21.587 --> 06:23.315
Didn't act like I was
different from them,

06:23.402 --> 06:26.050
with their normal homes,
normal families.

06:26.259 --> 06:30.509
- We were homies.
- Until you met Jonathan.

06:31.176 --> 06:33.625
Yeah. Until Jonathan.

06:33.790 --> 06:36.661
I imagine he must have been
pretty special.

06:36.892 --> 06:40.603
Long hair.
Acoustic guitar. Vaped cloves.

06:40.696 --> 06:42.960
Wow, come on, man.

06:43.048 --> 06:44.836
I know, I know.

06:45.462 --> 06:47.672
But I liked him so much.

06:48.142 --> 06:50.782
So much that I kind of stopped
hanging with my bros.

06:51.039 --> 06:53.321
Oh, it happens.

06:53.827 --> 06:56.176
We all get wrapped up
when we're in a relationship.

06:56.435 --> 06:58.610
Yeah, well, I got
a little extreme.

06:58.704 --> 07:02.110
I ignored them until Jonathan
ghosted me for a barista.

07:02.374 --> 07:05.123
So then I had no boyfriend
and no homies.

07:05.376 --> 07:07.292
That's why I asked them
to go camping.

07:07.379 --> 07:09.160
I thought I could get back in
with them.

07:09.247 --> 07:10.829
But the moment we got
to our campsite,

07:10.916 --> 07:13.181
they unloaded on me
about everything.

07:13.806 --> 07:15.032
So I walked off.

07:15.128 --> 07:16.776
Ended up getting lost.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.970
You find anything?

07:19.057 --> 07:21.407
No major bleeding.

07:21.588 --> 07:24.141
Does have a grade II
splenic lac, but it's stable.

07:24.229 --> 07:26.110
That still doesn't explain
how he lost so much blood.

07:26.197 --> 07:27.279
Two to three liters, at least.

07:27.366 --> 07:28.981
It doesn't make sense.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.215
Are those the test results?

07:31.532 --> 07:34.718
IRVING: His anemia's critical.
His body's starving for oxygen.

07:34.806 --> 07:37.157
- His organs are shutting down.
- He needs blood.

07:37.337 --> 07:39.025
And we don't have any units
that match his blood type.

07:39.112 --> 07:41.561
We need to figure this out.
Fast.

07:41.835 --> 07:44.485
[♪♪]

07:44.899 --> 07:47.332
Seems like Chastain's always
trying to squeeze blood

07:47.419 --> 07:49.587
- out of someone.
- ALEC: It's necessary.

07:49.743 --> 07:51.078
In the United States,
a patient needs

07:51.165 --> 07:52.765
a blood transfusion
every two seconds.

07:52.853 --> 07:54.749
And the shortages are only
becoming more common.

07:54.837 --> 07:58.179
Whatever. I'm just here for the
free cookies and orange juice.

07:58.267 --> 08:01.561
If I save a baby along the way,
well, good for me.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.882
Thank you for your donation.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.321
Man, you're good at dealing
with those patients.

08:06.409 --> 08:08.470
Eh, she likes to feel needed.

08:09.808 --> 08:12.712
Look, I know we're just
colleagues, which I respect,

08:12.876 --> 08:14.826
but am I allowed to ask
about your sister?

08:14.913 --> 08:17.728
Of course.
I don't have an answer.

08:17.829 --> 08:19.220
Are you okay?

08:19.314 --> 08:20.999
Well, I found out my blood's
a match, waiting to see

08:21.086 --> 08:23.668
if my father's is.
I got my CT this morning.

08:23.755 --> 08:25.336
Should get results soon.

08:25.423 --> 08:27.338
Who's going with you? Conrad?

08:27.425 --> 08:29.574
He doesn't know about it.

08:29.661 --> 08:32.164
It's fine.
I don't want to talk about it.

08:32.357 --> 08:34.039
Absolutely.

08:34.657 --> 08:36.470
Not my business.

08:37.102 --> 08:39.782
(monitor beeping rapidly)

08:40.044 --> 08:41.818
We're giving him
supplemental oxygen,

08:41.907 --> 08:44.188
but his O2 sats keep going down.

08:44.657 --> 08:47.212
Why is it so hard to breathe?

08:47.805 --> 08:49.946
These are normal
red blood cells.

08:50.048 --> 08:52.397
These are fragments of cells
that have burst open,

08:52.484 --> 08:54.063
and these are cells
that are sickled.

08:54.151 --> 08:56.300
That combination is making it
so you don't have enough

08:56.388 --> 08:58.899
red blood cells to carry
the oxygen throughout your body.

08:59.696 --> 09:02.415
But I've never been diagnosed
with sickle cell disease.

09:02.503 --> 09:04.790
That's 'cause I think you've got
a sickle cell trait.

09:04.896 --> 09:06.531
It's usually asymptomatic
unless there are

09:06.618 --> 09:07.879
major bodily stressors.

09:07.966 --> 09:10.449
Like in your case,
severe altitude and dehydration.

09:10.536 --> 09:12.617
Dr. Hawkins.
The blood bank just called.

09:12.704 --> 09:15.048
They have one unit of blood
available for our patient.

09:16.742 --> 09:17.989
Tell them to send that now,

09:18.076 --> 09:19.369
- but that's still not gonna be enough.
- Okay.

09:19.456 --> 09:21.416
Could we get a little help
with transporting here?

09:23.465 --> 09:26.103
We're gonna take a little trip
down to the basement.

09:29.764 --> 09:31.478
All right. Here we go.

09:35.923 --> 09:38.532
BELL: I contacted Atlanta General.
We're all in the same boat.

09:38.649 --> 09:41.351
(sighs)
Postpone elective surgeries,

09:41.439 --> 09:43.377
- encourage employee donations...
- GRAYSON: Dr. Bell!

09:43.464 --> 09:44.915
Dr. Bell! 911! 911!

09:45.003 --> 09:47.048
My mom is in the ER!

09:47.145 --> 09:49.813
I repeat, my mom is in the ER!

09:51.501 --> 09:53.470
That's all you, bro.

09:57.384 --> 09:59.204
BELL: So how long has
this been going on?

09:59.397 --> 10:02.337
Well, redness and swelling
for a few days.

10:02.425 --> 10:04.845
I thought it was age or weather
or something.

10:04.933 --> 10:07.882
But then I slipped in the shower
and twisted it.

10:08.033 --> 10:10.582
And now it's really bad.

10:10.669 --> 10:12.462
Go ahead, Dr. Bell.
We're all adults here.

10:12.556 --> 10:13.785
We all know you two
did the deed,

10:13.872 --> 10:15.064
- so just don't make it weird.
- Grayson?

10:15.151 --> 10:16.286
- Just examine her.
- Grayson?

10:16.374 --> 10:18.489
Please? Thank you.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.313
(quietly):
Grayson.

10:21.970 --> 10:23.946
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.767
Your mother is gonna need
a specialist.

10:28.020 --> 10:30.056
Who's the ER ortho consult
today?

10:30.285 --> 10:32.087
Right here, just finished.

10:32.259 --> 10:33.392
Hello.

10:33.480 --> 10:35.735
- Morning.
- I'm Dr. Kit Voss.

10:35.930 --> 10:38.077
Vivian Betournay.
Nice to meet you.

10:38.165 --> 10:40.278
I, uh, slipped in the shower.

10:40.365 --> 10:41.747
GRAYSON:
I'll have handrails put in.

10:41.834 --> 10:44.085
- I know a guy.
- Y-You know my assistant,

10:44.173 --> 10:47.280
um... Vivian is,
um, Grayson's mother.

10:47.368 --> 10:48.134
Mm.

10:48.222 --> 10:49.921
Dr. Voss is one of our
very best physicians.

10:50.008 --> 10:51.768
- Thank you, Randolph.
- Thank you, Randolph.

10:54.705 --> 10:57.027
KIT: Let's get an X-ray,
and then I'm going to need

10:57.115 --> 10:58.664
to get an arthrocentesis.

10:58.751 --> 11:03.134
Fritz, this hyperbaric chamber
is gonna pressurize,

11:03.221 --> 11:06.271
just like when a submarine
dives underwater.

11:06.517 --> 11:09.274
Increasing pressure's gonna
allow extra oxygen

11:09.361 --> 11:11.048
to dissolve into your blood.

11:11.704 --> 11:13.544
How long will I be in here?

11:13.720 --> 11:16.147
Till we can get more
blood for a transfusion.

11:16.493 --> 11:18.283
This hood is gonna
give you pure oxygen.

11:18.370 --> 11:19.931
Nurse Robert
will stay with you.

11:20.019 --> 11:22.120
There's a tech outside,
page me if anything changes.

11:22.207 --> 11:23.626
You good?

11:24.039 --> 11:26.655
All right, I'm gonna
take that as a yes.

11:27.665 --> 11:29.149
Dive time.

11:32.384 --> 11:34.052
(air hissing)

11:36.566 --> 11:38.154
Ready?

11:40.083 --> 11:42.052
Take him down to 60 feet.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.216
(breathing heavily)

11:52.373 --> 11:54.629
- DEVON: Who's coming tonight?
- Anyone who wants a beer

11:54.717 --> 11:56.168
and to complain about Chastain.

11:56.256 --> 11:57.322
It keeps us sane.

11:57.409 --> 11:58.803
- Irving?
- Always.

11:58.959 --> 12:00.887
- Conrad?
- Not unless Nic comes

12:00.975 --> 12:02.437
and she has a lot
with her sister right now,

12:02.524 --> 12:04.206
- so probably not.
- Hmm. Raptor.

12:04.294 --> 12:06.466
Unclear. Maybe he'll bring
that woman from this morning.

12:06.553 --> 12:07.699
(chuckles)

12:07.786 --> 12:09.334
Are you here for Mr. Harper?

12:09.537 --> 12:11.336
Shira Smook, anesthesiologist.

12:11.423 --> 12:13.504
Just came over
from Coburn Civic Med.

12:13.591 --> 12:15.040
Mina Okafor, surgical resident.

12:15.127 --> 12:17.451
Devon Pravesh, intern.
By the way,

12:17.539 --> 12:19.778
I called the blood bank
about Mr. Harper's surgery

12:19.865 --> 12:22.045
and they still have
ten units of type A positive.

12:22.133 --> 12:24.897
Are you sure it wasn't a typo?
(chuckles)

12:25.957 --> 12:27.571
Type O, typo.

12:27.705 --> 12:31.589
Sorry, bad jokes, they keep
the lambs from screaming.

12:31.676 --> 12:33.424
- Everybody needs something.
- Exactly.

12:33.936 --> 12:36.449
I'll be in Mr. Harper's OR
with you, Dr. Okafor.

12:36.537 --> 12:38.730
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Mr. Harper is not; he wishes

12:38.817 --> 12:40.967
he were anywhere else but here.

12:46.375 --> 12:48.090
- How am I looking, doctors?
- We had hoped

12:48.178 --> 12:50.327
the bowel obstruction
would resolve on its own.

12:50.507 --> 12:52.621
Unfortunately,
it has become emergent.

12:52.709 --> 12:53.889
You need an operation.

12:53.977 --> 12:55.731
(sighs) So, no way I'm gonna

12:55.819 --> 12:57.614
make it to the convention
this weekend?

12:57.702 --> 12:59.804
It's nut looking good.

13:02.007 --> 13:03.408
Sorry.

13:04.809 --> 13:06.411
(Vivian sighs)

13:08.409 --> 13:09.824
Where's your partner in crime?

13:10.115 --> 13:11.920
Grayson went to get snacks.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.647
Have my results come in?

13:14.045 --> 13:15.733
Vivian...

13:15.951 --> 13:17.449
you have gonorrhea.

13:17.537 --> 13:19.037
(laughs)

13:19.983 --> 13:22.326
Remember, I'm the knee patient.

13:22.428 --> 13:25.225
The knee?
Uh, my vagina is fine.

13:25.313 --> 13:27.660
The disease can travel
through your bloodstream

13:27.748 --> 13:29.498
and infect your joints.

13:29.615 --> 13:31.731
Although gonorrhea
is transmitted

13:31.819 --> 13:33.251
through sexual intercourse,

13:33.444 --> 13:36.621
it can be asymptomatic
until it shows up elsewhere.

13:36.708 --> 13:37.956
As it did here.

13:38.131 --> 13:41.201
Bright side, all you need
are antibiotics

13:41.289 --> 13:43.902
and a washout in the OR
under mild sedation.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.691
Well, I would rather have
the traditional gonorrhea,

13:46.779 --> 13:48.889
you know, the vagina kind.

13:49.233 --> 13:52.037
That never gets amputated.
(laughs)

13:55.444 --> 13:57.731
You know, for the record,
it's been, uh,

13:57.819 --> 13:59.177
it's been more
than six months since I was,

13:59.264 --> 14:01.779
- uh, with her...
- I'm sure you're fine.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.983
- I could run a test.
- No... (stammers)

14:05.603 --> 14:08.106
(snickering)

14:09.919 --> 14:11.200
Lindsay.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.215
Here you go.

14:13.303 --> 14:15.218
BRETT:
Dr. Bell.

14:15.461 --> 14:17.178
Brett.

14:17.266 --> 14:19.147
How can I help you?

14:19.417 --> 14:20.928
I'm getting out tomorrow, right?

14:21.016 --> 14:22.504
Yeah, I hope so.
I'm sure you want

14:22.592 --> 14:23.896
to get away
from all these doctors.

14:23.983 --> 14:25.413
To tell the truth,
I'm not actually trying

14:25.500 --> 14:27.436
to get away
from all the doctors.

14:27.709 --> 14:29.904
You know... Kit and me?

14:30.287 --> 14:32.077
Things are looking up.

14:32.623 --> 14:34.245
Oh, really?

14:34.373 --> 14:38.069
- I know, right?
- Later-in-life romantic reunion?

14:38.225 --> 14:40.108
- (chuckles)
- We should be a Hallmark movie.

14:40.196 --> 14:41.443
(both chuckle)

14:41.549 --> 14:42.898
We've got plans this weekend.

14:43.009 --> 14:46.194
So... if you can
spring me early...

14:46.467 --> 14:48.834
- I'll check your chart.
- Thank you.

14:55.553 --> 14:57.295
I told you
you didn't have to come.

14:57.581 --> 15:01.373
Oh, I'm happy to be here.
This is tough stuff.

15:01.739 --> 15:05.412
I've seen other people navigate
the organ donation process,

15:05.959 --> 15:06.973
it's... a lot.

15:07.061 --> 15:08.679
Nic Nevin?

15:09.006 --> 15:11.584
We reviewed the images
from this morning's CT scan.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.592
It shows that you have
an arterial anomaly

15:13.686 --> 15:15.288
- with your kidney.
- What kind of anomaly?

15:15.375 --> 15:17.108
An abnormal additional artery.

15:17.196 --> 15:18.979
Now, it's not dangerous
and it doesn't affect.

15:19.066 --> 15:20.547
Miss Nevin's day-to-day life,

15:20.927 --> 15:22.387
but it does disqualify her

15:22.475 --> 15:25.006
from being a donor.
I-I'm sorry.

15:29.350 --> 15:31.037
There are other ways.

15:31.186 --> 15:32.671
I can start making some calls.

15:32.759 --> 15:33.909
See about getting Jessie into

15:33.997 --> 15:35.449
- a different transplant program.
-(exhales)

15:35.537 --> 15:37.019
Yeah.

15:37.435 --> 15:39.369
Thanks for coming.

15:50.828 --> 15:52.290
Hi.

15:52.377 --> 15:55.107
Your assistant's mother
has septic arthritis.

15:55.195 --> 15:57.685
I've scheduled her
a washout in the OR.

15:57.773 --> 16:00.468
Well, thank you very much
for taking care of her.

16:00.617 --> 16:02.968
I checked Brett's chart

16:03.055 --> 16:06.054
and he's happy
to be going home tomorrow...

16:06.468 --> 16:07.796
with you.

16:08.914 --> 16:10.908
Brett wants us to try again.

16:11.156 --> 16:13.411
Oh. And do you want that?

16:13.859 --> 16:17.115
I'm leaning in that direction.

16:17.578 --> 16:20.898
Well, I just... it sounds like
you'd be very happy with him.

16:21.187 --> 16:22.787
I'm leaning.

16:23.473 --> 16:25.123
I'm not there.

16:25.574 --> 16:26.958
Interesting.

16:27.176 --> 16:28.652
GRAYSON:
Dr. Bell!

16:28.872 --> 16:30.054
Dr. Bell.

16:30.149 --> 16:32.668
Did you give my mom gonorrhea?

16:32.793 --> 16:34.293
Are you gonna hit me?

16:36.973 --> 16:38.324
No.

16:38.710 --> 16:40.848
No, I'm a, I'm a pacifist.

16:47.565 --> 16:49.380
DEVON:
Okay, let me...

16:49.690 --> 16:50.869
(Harper groans)

16:50.957 --> 16:53.648
So, Dr. Pravesh will take you
to pre-op in about an hour

16:53.736 --> 16:55.680
and I will meet you
in the operating room.

16:55.768 --> 16:57.622
I-I guess there's no way
that I could

16:57.709 --> 16:59.390
stay in costume for the surgery.

16:59.477 --> 17:01.260
- Is there?
- It's not sterile.

17:01.986 --> 17:03.661
- Okay. Would you mind, then?
- Yeah.

17:04.643 --> 17:06.071
It's a shame,

17:06.196 --> 17:08.775
I-I was really looking forward
to the convention this year.

17:08.901 --> 17:10.536
Is it a, um...

17:11.665 --> 17:12.869
...squirrel convention?

17:12.957 --> 17:14.479
No, no, no, no. (stammers)

17:14.567 --> 17:16.939
There's rabbits, too,
and, um, chipmunks.

17:17.060 --> 17:18.576
Uh, the occasional weasel.

17:18.768 --> 17:20.810
Almost all the rodents
are represented.

17:20.897 --> 17:22.646
Yeah, people, people think
it's a sex thing,

17:22.733 --> 17:24.336
but it's not.

17:26.271 --> 17:27.768
I'm sorry you can't go.

17:27.972 --> 17:29.887
Well, it's the one time
a year when I actually

17:29.974 --> 17:31.533
get to be with people who are...

17:31.621 --> 17:34.416
you know, like me.

17:35.647 --> 17:37.018
SHIRA:
Dr. Okafor?

17:37.315 --> 17:39.197
I just came from blood bank,
they're down

17:39.284 --> 17:40.998
- to four units of A positive.
- Oh, don't worry.

17:41.085 --> 17:43.000
One of those is ours;
I put one on hold

17:43.087 --> 17:44.869
- for Mr. Harper's surgery.
- Okay, good.

17:44.956 --> 17:48.307
Then... we don't need to
throw in the bowel just yet.

17:48.674 --> 17:50.241
(Devon laughs)

17:50.471 --> 17:52.713
Throw in the bowel?
That...

17:52.994 --> 17:54.094
that really is terrible.

17:54.182 --> 17:56.299
Well, thanks. (laughs)

17:57.580 --> 17:59.717
Okay, this one laughed at that.

17:59.804 --> 18:02.088
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, come on. She's funny.

18:02.176 --> 18:04.041
HARPER:
Uh-huh. I see what's happening.

18:04.177 --> 18:06.986
You know, I may just be a guy
getting out of a squirrel suit,

18:07.074 --> 18:08.654
but I'll tell you this:

18:08.742 --> 18:10.657
that doctor
was flirting with you.

18:10.745 --> 18:12.594
- No, she's not.
- Oh, no, I agree

18:12.682 --> 18:14.697
with our patient;
her joke was a flirt joke

18:14.785 --> 18:16.533
and your laugh...
was a flirt laugh.

18:16.621 --> 18:19.037
- No, it wasn't.
- Uh-huh. I approve.

18:19.130 --> 18:21.229
You know, look,
we're all weird in our own way,

18:21.317 --> 18:24.096
but if you can find someone
whose weird matches your own,

18:24.252 --> 18:25.565
I say go for it.

18:25.653 --> 18:26.901
Well, I do not approve.

18:26.989 --> 18:29.361
At least not until
she comes up with better jokes.

18:30.168 --> 18:31.359
All right. Lay back.

18:31.447 --> 18:33.033
Okay. Ow.

18:33.986 --> 18:35.485
Thanks for the latte.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.155
NIC:
Thanks for being here.

18:38.104 --> 18:39.383
(sighs)

18:39.471 --> 18:40.825
Look.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.060
Things are about to get tough.

18:43.147 --> 18:46.597
We don't know when or if
Jessie's getting a kidney

18:46.684 --> 18:49.453
and dialysis is hard even when
there are no complications,

18:49.541 --> 18:53.070
and there are almost always
complications.

18:53.432 --> 18:55.072
Are you trying to scare me away?

18:55.159 --> 18:56.953
No, I need to make sure

18:57.041 --> 18:59.143
that you're not gonna run
when things get harder.

18:59.455 --> 19:01.078
Jessie didn't even finish rehab,

19:01.166 --> 19:02.830
I'm just...

19:03.221 --> 19:05.962
I'm worried this is all
too much for her.

19:08.908 --> 19:10.375
Nic...

19:14.879 --> 19:17.087
Why don't we just
put all this aside for a minute?

19:17.186 --> 19:18.790
Hmm?

19:20.321 --> 19:21.753
What about you?

19:22.946 --> 19:23.968
I'm fine.

19:24.055 --> 19:25.803
- Let's just focus on Jessie.
- No.

19:25.962 --> 19:27.338
You're not fine.

19:27.557 --> 19:28.992
That's why I'm here.

19:30.027 --> 19:31.942
I knew that you'd put
everything aside

19:32.029 --> 19:34.111
to take care of your sister,
like you always do.

19:34.198 --> 19:35.510
Of course I would.
What else would I do?

19:35.597 --> 19:37.634
Are you sleeping? At all?

19:37.898 --> 19:40.016
You were still awake when
I went to bed last night,

19:40.104 --> 19:42.095
you were the first one up.
Plus Conrad.

19:42.183 --> 19:44.915
Jessie said you're having
problems with him, too.

19:48.717 --> 19:50.071
Look...

19:50.448 --> 19:52.368
your sister got here

19:52.884 --> 19:55.405
because of her bad decisions.

19:55.868 --> 19:58.169
Addiction is a disease;
she didn't ask for this.

19:58.256 --> 19:59.806
Neither did you.

20:02.427 --> 20:05.134
I'm here for you, too.

20:07.399 --> 20:09.347
So I want you
to just hang in there

20:09.556 --> 20:11.196
until we get my results.

20:11.337 --> 20:12.962
If I'm a match...

20:14.212 --> 20:15.507
we're golden.

20:19.156 --> 20:21.904
- (groaning)
- (alarm ringing)

20:22.462 --> 20:23.882
Should I bring
the patient back up?

20:23.970 --> 20:26.179
No, we take him out
of the chamber,

20:26.267 --> 20:28.062
he won't have enough
circulating oxygen to survive.

20:28.149 --> 20:30.272
Hey. Hang on, I'm coming in.

20:30.360 --> 20:34.339
Oh, God, it hurts! (yells)

20:34.712 --> 20:36.954
(Fritz moaning)

20:37.042 --> 20:38.957
Talk to me.

20:39.153 --> 20:40.579
ROBERT:
Abdominal pain.

20:40.667 --> 20:43.483
And his pressure just dropped.

20:44.134 --> 20:46.749
- Where is the pain exactly?
- Left upper quadrant.

20:46.837 --> 20:49.212
Give him 50 of fentanyl,
set up the ultrasound.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.204
Fritz? Keep breathing.

20:51.649 --> 20:52.908
In...

20:53.720 --> 20:54.925
out.

20:55.470 --> 20:56.806
In...

20:56.931 --> 20:59.118
- out.
- (wheezes)

20:59.310 --> 21:01.306
- In...
- (beeps)

21:06.010 --> 21:08.357
Push another 50 of fentanyl.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.498
(Fritz groans)

21:16.629 --> 21:18.544
CONRAD: There's free
fluid around the spleen.

21:18.803 --> 21:20.551
His injury's getting worse.

21:20.638 --> 21:22.706
He's gonna bleed out.
Page Dr. Austin.

21:22.794 --> 21:24.732
We need to get this spleen
out of Fritz now!

21:28.935 --> 21:30.246
CHU:
It's a little tight in here.

21:30.334 --> 21:32.097
You couldn't find
a less convenient place

21:32.185 --> 21:33.498
for surgery, Dr. Hawkins?

21:33.585 --> 21:35.432
Was the surface of
the sun already booked?

21:35.520 --> 21:36.276
Give it a minute.

21:36.364 --> 21:37.835
- It grows on you.
- (Austin chuckles)

21:37.922 --> 21:41.238
The best filtered air
outside of an OR.

21:41.325 --> 21:42.673
(monitors beeping)

21:43.528 --> 21:44.909
AUSTIN:
Nurse Pund.

21:44.996 --> 21:47.412
You turn that Bovie on in here,
we could all go up

21:47.499 --> 21:49.755
like Roman candles.
Pop, pop, pow.

21:49.849 --> 21:51.649
In this chamber,
you can't use anything

21:51.736 --> 21:54.083
that could cause a spark,
so no Bovies.

21:54.223 --> 21:56.013
And no defibrillators, either.

21:56.161 --> 21:57.855
If he codes, we can't
shock him back to life.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.628
No worries. These magical
babies will make sure

22:00.716 --> 22:03.628
nothing happens to our
forest-wandering friend.

22:04.216 --> 22:05.458
10 blade.

22:10.873 --> 22:13.541
That's Chastain's last bag.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.106
Okay.

22:18.362 --> 22:20.898
So we can't lose
any blood at all.

22:28.372 --> 22:30.374
(monitor beeping)

22:32.744 --> 22:35.372
There's a small perf
in this dead bowel.

22:35.460 --> 22:37.199
Mr. Harper's going to have
significant discomfort

22:37.286 --> 22:38.463
from the peritonitis.

22:38.550 --> 22:40.130
I'll make sure
we have the pain meds.

22:40.217 --> 22:41.466
How much longer
you think it'll be?

22:41.553 --> 22:43.401
Maybe about 20 minutes
until we close.

22:43.488 --> 22:46.303
Great, his backup IV line
just blew.

22:46.390 --> 22:47.872
I'd hate to start another one

22:47.959 --> 22:49.707
- if it's just going to be...
- Don't say it.

22:49.794 --> 22:51.742
...in vein. (chuckles)

22:51.829 --> 22:53.811
Fine, you don't appreciate

22:53.898 --> 22:56.414
a pun, I can respect that,
not everyone does.

22:56.501 --> 22:57.915
All I'm saying is,

22:58.002 --> 23:02.173
if he really needed
to squirrel away some nuts...

23:04.739 --> 23:07.739
(Mina laughing loudly)

23:07.966 --> 23:09.394
What's that sound?

23:09.699 --> 23:11.633
(laughter continues)

23:14.255 --> 23:18.153
I've-I've never heard
Dr. Okafor laugh before.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.396
It's unsettling.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.411
JESSICA:
Yes, it is.

23:24.989 --> 23:27.672
(laughter continues)

23:27.934 --> 23:29.779
I was not expecting that.
(laughs)

23:29.867 --> 23:31.020
(chuckles)

23:31.635 --> 23:33.349
VIVIAN:
If I'd known nerve blocks

23:33.437 --> 23:35.219
killed all feeling
so effectively,

23:35.306 --> 23:37.972
I would've gotten one
when I married Grayson's father.

23:38.060 --> 23:40.356
- You don't feel this at all?
- No, nothing.

23:40.552 --> 23:42.177
KIT:
Here we go, then.

23:44.278 --> 23:47.197
How is Grayson?
Seemed a little upset earlier.

23:47.284 --> 23:48.433
VIVIAN:
Well, you know,

23:48.520 --> 23:52.136
I'm sure it's not easy watching
your parents fall apart.

23:52.325 --> 23:54.304
- Do you have children?
- Two.

23:54.770 --> 23:56.774
I'm not with
their father either.

23:56.966 --> 23:58.513
Well, that's how it goes.

23:58.656 --> 24:00.567
That's not always how it goes.

24:00.655 --> 24:02.111
VIVIAN:
You're young. You don't know.

24:02.199 --> 24:06.060
At first, you're in love
and planning for the future.

24:06.177 --> 24:09.159
Next, you're having
your cheating husband's STD

24:09.247 --> 24:10.435
drained from your knee.

24:10.523 --> 24:12.755
- KIT: Could be worse.
- There is no way.

24:12.844 --> 24:15.401
The gonorrhea could've
infected your eye.

24:15.489 --> 24:17.595
Pus literally dripping
from your eyeball

24:17.682 --> 24:18.677
and running down your face.

24:18.765 --> 24:22.442
Oh, you win.
That's disgusting. Oh, my God.

24:23.077 --> 24:25.326
Ugh, more than anything,

24:25.414 --> 24:28.163
I just can't believe
that I'm here, at my age.

24:28.359 --> 24:29.940
I'm right there
with you, sister.

24:30.027 --> 24:32.065
Was your marriage
as bad as mine?

24:32.153 --> 24:33.744
Marriages, actually.

24:33.831 --> 24:36.122
Two. And no, they weren't.

24:36.474 --> 24:38.458
At least, the first one wasn't.

24:38.670 --> 24:40.117
He was actually a decent guy.

24:40.286 --> 24:41.852
Should've held on to him.

24:41.939 --> 24:43.958
Maybe I should have.

24:44.208 --> 24:46.442
Maybe it's too late now.

24:46.754 --> 24:48.724
Well, a smart surgeon

24:48.812 --> 24:52.396
like you, I'm sure
you have other options.

24:52.849 --> 24:54.606
- I think I do.
- (elevator bell chimes)

24:57.354 --> 25:00.212
Hey. I dropped Jessie off
at dialysis

25:00.300 --> 25:02.138
a while ago, what's going on?

25:08.790 --> 25:10.528
You're not a match.

25:13.817 --> 25:15.019
(Nic sighs)

25:19.185 --> 25:21.020
Did you bring my meds?

25:22.599 --> 25:24.461
WOMAN (over P.A.):
<i>Dr. Kennedy to triage.</i>

25:25.777 --> 25:28.608
Those anti-craving strips aren't
working anymore. I-I just...

25:29.509 --> 25:31.844
still want to use.

25:33.303 --> 25:35.152
So bad.

25:35.326 --> 25:37.241
That'll get better, Jess.

25:37.755 --> 25:40.442
I'll up your dose. You got this,

25:40.552 --> 25:42.472
- I promise.
- Nic, if I couldn't

25:42.560 --> 25:43.981
stay off drugs
when my life was good,

25:44.068 --> 25:46.070
how am I supposed to do it now?

25:51.833 --> 25:54.724
- Dad's pulling the car around.
- Great.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.865
These short gastrics
are killing me.

26:01.083 --> 26:02.604
Can we call
the blood bank again?

26:02.692 --> 26:04.902
I just touched base.
Still nothing.

26:05.114 --> 26:07.659
He's getting acidotic.
There's not enough oxygen

26:07.747 --> 26:10.169
- delivery to his tissues.
- AUSTIN: I need more hands.

26:10.646 --> 26:13.009
Hawkins, get Okafor here now.

26:13.097 --> 26:14.645
I'm on it.

26:15.653 --> 26:18.880
- Take them down to 100 feet.
- That's pretty deep.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.981
I'm buying us some time.

26:24.944 --> 26:27.944
RECEPTIONIST: I'm sorry, but we're just
all out right now. If you could just

26:28.045 --> 26:30.300
have a seat, we'll be with you.
Thank you.

26:30.388 --> 26:31.832
Uh, if you're here about
one of the transplants

26:31.919 --> 26:33.798
that got pushed, nothing I can
do about it, we're out of blood.

26:33.885 --> 26:36.867
No, no, um, I was here this
morning about a kidney donation.

26:37.063 --> 26:39.065
- Last name?
- Nevin.

26:42.393 --> 26:43.808
- RECEPTIONIST: Jessie?
- NIC: Yeah.

26:43.895 --> 26:45.654
Sorry, nothing I can do
until the donor calls back

26:45.741 --> 26:48.435
- to schedule his follow-up.
- The donor?

26:48.696 --> 26:50.773
Uh, Kyle Nevin.
We can't move forward

26:50.861 --> 26:52.520
with the intake
until he does that.

26:53.504 --> 26:55.682
- Kyle's a match?
- Right, but like I said,

26:55.770 --> 26:57.722
we can't move ahead until
he calls for the follow-up.

26:57.809 --> 26:59.942
- Is there anything else?
- No, thanks.

27:07.781 --> 27:09.399
- AUSTIN: Fogarty clamp.
- He's not clotting.

27:09.486 --> 27:11.145
CHU:
Pressure's dropping.

27:11.233 --> 27:12.848
AUSTIN:
His organs are shutting down.

27:13.731 --> 27:15.272
Would it help if we
dive deeper?

27:15.359 --> 27:17.975
No, increasing the pressure
can only do so much.

27:18.062 --> 27:20.077
If we don't get real blood
into him, he's gonna code.

27:20.164 --> 27:23.044
- He's dying right in front of us.
- Take me down

27:23.132 --> 27:25.286
- as fast as you can.
- They're at 100 feet.

27:25.374 --> 27:27.289
If I drop you down
that far too fast, it'll put

27:27.377 --> 27:29.713
- too much stress on your body...
- Do it anyway.

27:35.510 --> 27:37.011
(air hissing)

27:56.033 --> 27:58.702
[♪♪]

28:12.583 --> 28:14.832
- MINA: More bicarb.
- CHU: It won't work.

28:14.919 --> 28:17.154
Without more blood,
he's going to die.

28:18.685 --> 28:21.371
I'm O negative, universal donor.

28:21.458 --> 28:24.909
- Sylvie, help me out.
- Didn't you just donate?

28:24.996 --> 28:27.845
Another bag. That was only half.

28:27.932 --> 28:29.693
Oh, okay, this isn't
the military.

28:29.781 --> 28:31.232
Blood needs
to be screened for HIV,

28:31.320 --> 28:34.071
- hepatitis...
- I'm clean. Trust me.

28:35.383 --> 28:37.154
Chu. Hold up.

28:37.336 --> 28:39.356
Now I don't doubt
that your blood is clean,

28:39.443 --> 28:42.068
but if he dies right now,
we're all legally protected.

28:42.156 --> 28:43.193
Whereas if we put

28:43.281 --> 28:45.429
your unprocessed blood in him
and then he dies...

28:45.516 --> 28:47.418
So don't let him die.

28:51.906 --> 28:54.812
All right. You heard the man.

28:54.968 --> 28:56.664
Let's save this kid's life.

29:03.496 --> 29:05.211
- (knocking on door)
- BELL: Knock, knock.

29:06.084 --> 29:08.172
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:09.684 --> 29:12.217
I heard the surgery
w-was a success.

29:13.147 --> 29:14.725
How do you feel?

29:14.812 --> 29:16.593
It's not my finest moment.

29:16.680 --> 29:19.365
I-It could happen to anybody.

29:19.465 --> 29:22.246
And, FYI, I got tested,
I'm clean,

29:22.334 --> 29:24.434
so neither one of us
gave the other gonorrhea.

29:24.521 --> 29:25.602
I know that.

29:25.689 --> 29:27.771
It was my jackhole ex-husband.

29:28.551 --> 29:30.634
But I get to tell him
that he has gonorrhea,

29:30.722 --> 29:32.365
and that will be very fun.

29:32.453 --> 29:33.896
(laughs)

29:35.058 --> 29:36.138
Hey.

29:40.451 --> 29:41.784
How about you?

29:42.652 --> 29:45.027
Are you seeing anybody
right now?

29:45.537 --> 29:47.485
Well, complicated, but no.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.995
Really?

29:49.776 --> 29:51.260
Well, you should...

29:51.425 --> 29:53.909
'cause you're a decent guy.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.980
And not awful in bed.

29:56.068 --> 29:58.214
(both laugh)

29:59.589 --> 30:02.723
I started seeing someone
a few weeks ago.

30:02.956 --> 30:05.509
He's sweet

30:05.792 --> 30:07.111
and kind.

30:07.198 --> 30:10.447
We're taking it slow...
Thank God... so no sex yet.

30:11.183 --> 30:13.137
He's a lucky man.

30:14.771 --> 30:17.152
You were good for me, Randolph,

30:18.106 --> 30:20.035
at least for my ego.

30:23.114 --> 30:26.895
It's only a matter of time
until you find the one.

30:29.832 --> 30:32.356
I don't know if that's
in the cards for a guy like me.

30:40.106 --> 30:41.946
How you feeling, Hawkins?

30:42.574 --> 30:45.049
If Fritz is good,
I'm feeling fine.

30:45.269 --> 30:46.936
(pager vibrating)

30:50.246 --> 30:52.356
Fritz's "friends" are here.

30:52.699 --> 30:53.858
Well, go.

30:53.945 --> 30:56.645
- We're almost done here.
- (grunts)

30:57.938 --> 30:59.457
Hey, yo.

31:03.157 --> 31:04.503
Respect.

31:20.938 --> 31:24.688
I'm, uh... feeling light-headed,

31:25.543 --> 31:27.606
yet relaxed.

31:27.785 --> 31:29.994
Like you've just had
a stiff martini?

31:31.199 --> 31:32.429
Exactly.

31:32.684 --> 31:34.127
Nitrogen narcosis.

31:34.215 --> 31:36.200
AUSTIN:
Good ole martini effect.

31:36.613 --> 31:37.935
You know,
I've always heard about it.

31:38.022 --> 31:39.166
I've never felt it.

31:39.254 --> 31:41.105
It's fascinating, Mina.

31:41.684 --> 31:43.507
Not at all unpleasant.

31:43.699 --> 31:46.043
MINA:
Gases at high pressures

31:46.262 --> 31:48.775
can cause temporary disruption
to nerve signaling,

31:48.863 --> 31:50.047
impair judgment

31:50.134 --> 31:52.356
and delayed response times.

31:52.488 --> 31:54.952
It's rare,
but it can happen to anyone.

31:55.527 --> 31:58.088
So, it's like you're drunk?

31:58.285 --> 31:59.756
Yeah, pretty much.

32:00.504 --> 32:02.986
All right, Okafor,
I'm gonna need you to finish

32:03.074 --> 32:04.426
closing up.

32:05.690 --> 32:07.856
(sighs) Thank you, Chu.

32:08.052 --> 32:09.566
Whew.

32:09.863 --> 32:11.410
(inhales)

32:11.622 --> 32:14.538
- (exhales)
- So...

32:14.625 --> 32:17.396
you were with a woman
this morning.

32:17.750 --> 32:21.797
Uh, well, sometimes
I'm with women in the morning

32:21.885 --> 32:23.934
and also the evening.

32:24.498 --> 32:25.811
(chuckles)

32:27.350 --> 32:28.834
Wait, are you trying
to take advantage

32:28.922 --> 32:32.088
- of my inebriation?
- Mm. Perhaps.

32:32.678 --> 32:34.458
Only if it's working.

32:34.631 --> 32:35.732
Cute.

32:36.888 --> 32:38.871
Well, that pretty lady
you speak of

32:38.959 --> 32:40.931
was a liaison
to an adoption agency.

32:41.232 --> 32:43.187
- Are you adopting a child?
- No.

32:44.295 --> 32:47.412
No, I looked up
my birth parents.

32:47.645 --> 32:48.771
Get this.

32:48.959 --> 32:52.412
Bio Mom is a doctor.

32:53.420 --> 32:54.844
What are the odds?

32:55.561 --> 32:57.490
Turns out that was the problem.

32:57.868 --> 32:59.481
She was in med school
when she got pregnant.

32:59.568 --> 33:01.363
She wanted to focus
on her career,

33:01.451 --> 33:03.271
so they decided to give me up.

33:04.937 --> 33:06.513
Where are they now?

33:06.601 --> 33:08.182
Right here in Atlanta.

33:08.928 --> 33:10.404
Together, married,

33:10.537 --> 33:11.902
three grown-ass kids.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.263
The ones they didn't give away.

33:13.350 --> 33:15.265
(chuckles softly)

33:15.352 --> 33:17.379
I guess old August Jeremiah

33:17.467 --> 33:19.709
just showed up
at the wrong time.

33:22.164 --> 33:23.678
(Austin laughs)

33:24.271 --> 33:26.230
Ooh.

33:32.793 --> 33:36.176
Uh... hey, hey, hey. Shh.

33:36.264 --> 33:38.322
- Jessie's sleeping...
- You haven't changed a damn bit.

33:38.409 --> 33:40.355
It's not that you can't
give Jessie your kidney,

33:40.443 --> 33:42.379
it's that you won't!

33:44.998 --> 33:46.550
(sighs)

33:49.139 --> 33:51.335
- Nic, it's complicated...
- Why can't you, for once,

33:51.422 --> 33:53.970
for once, do something
that is not selfish?

33:54.057 --> 33:57.936
There's a reason they don't
hand out kidneys to addicts.

33:58.029 --> 33:59.387
They use again, they destroy

33:59.475 --> 34:01.745
- perfectly good organs.
- She is your daughter.

34:01.832 --> 34:03.163
Okay, so maybe in-in
six months, a year...

34:03.250 --> 34:04.214
She might not last that long.

34:04.301 --> 34:06.146
That's exactly my point!

34:07.787 --> 34:10.230
Who's it gonna help if she has
my kidney inside of her

34:10.318 --> 34:13.536
- and she OD's?
- (scoffs softly)

34:15.539 --> 34:18.226
(exhales):
Wow.

34:18.315 --> 34:20.755
- I'm sorry, I...
- You didn't...

34:22.619 --> 34:24.380
...you didn't come here
to help either one of us.

34:24.467 --> 34:27.598
You came here
to make yourself feel better

34:27.686 --> 34:29.438
for being a crappy father
our entire lives.

34:29.525 --> 34:32.779
- That's why you're here.
- That's not fair, and that's not right.

34:32.967 --> 34:33.980
Get out.

34:34.068 --> 34:35.466
And don't come back.

34:38.369 --> 34:39.803
Get out.

35:04.100 --> 35:06.615
Is someone here
to see Fritz Rawlins?

35:06.797 --> 35:08.278
Is Fritz okay?

35:08.662 --> 35:11.448
- He will be.
- MONROE: Look...

35:11.535 --> 35:13.582
we weren't trying
to make him run away from us.

35:13.670 --> 35:15.966
Yeah, we just wanted to get some
things off our chests, like how

35:16.053 --> 35:17.599
it wasn't cool when he dropped
us to hang with Jonathan,

35:17.686 --> 35:19.567
- so we told him that.
- And he got mad.

35:19.655 --> 35:21.561
And then we got mad,
and then it got ugly.

35:21.608 --> 35:23.889
RALPH: Yeah, Fritz stomped
off, said he had to pee.

35:24.303 --> 35:26.404
I-I guess
we should've been clear.

35:27.608 --> 35:30.797
It's not about him
being with Jonathan.

35:31.584 --> 35:33.310
I mean, we don't like him.
The guy's a schmuck...

35:33.397 --> 35:35.035
Dude's a part
of our rival fraternity.

35:35.123 --> 35:36.348
Fritz could do way better.

35:36.436 --> 35:38.592
But we just missed our homie.

35:43.240 --> 35:44.811
I'm pretty sure
he missed you, too.

35:45.802 --> 35:47.457
Come on. I'll take you to him.

35:47.592 --> 35:50.233
- Come on.
- MONROE: Thanks, Doc.

35:55.959 --> 35:58.779
Hey, Dr. Bell. I, uh...

35:58.873 --> 36:00.904
I just wanted
to make sure we're chill.

36:01.017 --> 36:03.365
You know, after-after our beef.

36:06.365 --> 36:09.779
Can I still work here,
even after I almost hit you?

36:12.639 --> 36:15.888
You know, Grayson, during the
course of your employment here,

36:15.975 --> 36:19.425
I've had multiple reasons
to fire you.

36:19.512 --> 36:21.326
Mostly, for
inappropriate suggestions

36:21.414 --> 36:24.295
of a personal nature, and for
your seeming inability to speak

36:24.389 --> 36:29.076
in any manner that even remotely
resembles the English language.

36:30.685 --> 36:32.811
But...

36:34.162 --> 36:36.544
defending your mother,
I'm not gonna fire you for that.

36:38.147 --> 36:39.398
(chuckles)

36:41.834 --> 36:43.795
You're the dopest, Dr. B.

36:45.439 --> 36:47.053
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:47.273 --> 36:49.967
No, uh... seriously. Look at you.

36:50.055 --> 36:53.024
I mean, you're-you're literally
giving your blood

36:53.112 --> 36:54.483
to help other people.

36:54.571 --> 36:56.094
My pops would never do that.

36:56.182 --> 36:58.022
He's only in it for himself.

36:59.852 --> 37:01.033
That's why I liked the idea

37:01.120 --> 37:02.873
of-of you hanging out
with my mom.

37:03.701 --> 37:04.983
You're not like that.

37:05.071 --> 37:06.619
I don't think you know me
very well.

37:07.170 --> 37:09.174
I think I do.

37:09.261 --> 37:10.610
You're one of the good ones.

37:10.959 --> 37:12.475
You just keep it way deep down,

37:12.563 --> 37:14.678
so people will think
you're a hard-ass.

37:17.704 --> 37:19.952
Can we get a needle in this kid?

37:20.569 --> 37:21.941
Oh.

37:27.046 --> 37:29.233
- Hey, sleepy.
- Hi.

37:29.326 --> 37:30.639
(groans)

37:30.727 --> 37:34.404
Apparently, dialysis makes me
take three-hour naps.

37:36.989 --> 37:38.483
Where's Dad?

37:46.307 --> 37:48.092
(laughs softly)

37:51.337 --> 37:53.506
Right on schedule.

38:03.149 --> 38:05.529
It's just you and me now, huh?

38:05.727 --> 38:08.195
(whispers):
It's just us.

38:12.291 --> 38:14.209
(sighs)

38:14.624 --> 38:16.381
Good.

38:17.085 --> 38:19.387
I like it better
that way anyway.

38:23.018 --> 38:25.402
All right, Mr. Harper,
you're up for a milligram

38:25.490 --> 38:27.100
of hydromorphone.

38:27.373 --> 38:29.553
(humming)

38:40.500 --> 38:42.536
You don't need all of this.

38:56.779 --> 38:58.483
Go ahead.

38:58.889 --> 39:00.225
MINA:
Go ahead what?

39:00.420 --> 39:02.756
You took advantage
of my altered state,

39:02.865 --> 39:05.326
and now you want to explore the
information that you gathered.

39:05.414 --> 39:07.329
Oh, please.
You wanted to tell someone

39:07.417 --> 39:09.686
about your biological parents.

39:11.350 --> 39:13.069
Will you contact them?

39:14.253 --> 39:15.826
I don't know.

39:16.842 --> 39:19.342
I understand
why you would be upset.

39:20.492 --> 39:22.131
I'm not upset.

39:22.322 --> 39:24.237
I'm not angry, either.

39:24.355 --> 39:28.334
Every day, I choose my career
over my personal life.

39:28.833 --> 39:31.326
It must be in the DNA.

39:34.406 --> 39:39.209
But if you wanted to be angry
at them, that'd be okay with me.

39:41.613 --> 39:44.223
Are you still drunk
from the hyperbaric chamber?

39:44.311 --> 39:46.699
(chuckles)
Maybe.

39:46.848 --> 39:48.482
(laughs softly)

39:53.525 --> 39:55.475
I can be angry for you.

40:04.670 --> 40:07.040
Thank you.

40:15.685 --> 40:18.920
Dr. Voss. Look,
I wanted to thank you

40:19.008 --> 40:20.355
for taking care
of Grayson's mom.

40:20.719 --> 40:23.092
And for your discretion.

40:23.180 --> 40:26.701
Eh, what's a little
"gono-knee-ah" between friends?

40:26.893 --> 40:29.641
- I, uh... (laughs)
- And I liked her quite a bit.

40:29.795 --> 40:31.147
I understand the attraction.

40:31.662 --> 40:35.490
Well, to be clear, that was
a temporary situation.

40:35.578 --> 40:38.834
Well, I certainly know
my way around those.

40:40.404 --> 40:41.569
Um...

40:41.758 --> 40:45.733
Look, I want to tell you,
you're not gonna screw it up.

40:46.162 --> 40:50.162
Whatever you end up doing,
it'll be the right thing.

40:50.249 --> 40:52.564
It'll be the good thing.

40:52.787 --> 40:57.428
And if you don't lean
in that direction,

40:58.404 --> 41:00.115
I'm here for you.

41:02.194 --> 41:03.542
(quietly):
Okay.

41:03.763 --> 41:05.185
Have a good night.

41:05.746 --> 41:07.445
Y-You, too.
