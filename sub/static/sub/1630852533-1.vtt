WEBVTT

00:00.801 --> 00:03.402
There's something
kind of darker in here.

00:05.239 --> 00:07.373
I think there could have been
a lot of negativity

00:07.375 --> 00:10.476
because of Masonic rituals
and stuff.

00:12.013 --> 00:13.579
Whoa!

00:14.982 --> 00:18.450
Something just yelled very
loudly, "Get the [bleep] out."

00:18.452 --> 00:21.587
I got a message for you.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.288
The dead are in the basement.

00:23.290 --> 00:24.957
Oh.

00:25.860 --> 00:28.060
I don't know if you know this,
but you're deceased.

00:28.062 --> 00:30.829
You're no longer
a part of the living.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.097
"I'll come back."

00:32.099 --> 00:34.166
There was a really
creepy whisper
that just said that,

00:34.168 --> 00:36.502
and something's touching me.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.937
<i>  That's really strange.</i>

00:38.939 --> 00:42.074
<i>  There's more to this basement</i>
<i>  than meets the eye.</i>

00:42.076 --> 00:45.210
[woman speaking].

00:45.212 --> 00:48.447
<i> Right now, they're treating it</i>
<i>  like a crime scene.</i>

00:49.250 --> 00:51.150
<i>  The dead want a voice.</i>

00:51.152 --> 00:52.284
We just wanna
help this family.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.053
<i>  The living need our help.</i>

00:54.055 --> 00:55.054
Have you always been here?

00:55.056 --> 00:56.255
He was watching already.

00:56.257 --> 00:58.290
[tense music playing]

01:08.102 --> 01:09.134
<i> [Adam] This is it, right?</i>

01:09.136 --> 01:11.170
<i> [Amy] This is it.</i>

01:11.172 --> 01:13.405
<i> [Adam] This place</i>
<i>  already looks creepy.</i>

01:15.376 --> 01:18.210
<i> [Amy] Adam and I are in East</i>
<i>  Bridgewater, Massachusetts,</i>

01:18.212 --> 01:22.681
<i> getting ready to investigate a</i>
<i> 130-year-old Masonic building.</i>

01:26.187 --> 01:27.920
<i>  Lorrie Parker called us in.</i>

01:27.922 --> 01:30.989
<i>  She owns</i>
<i>  an antique shop here.</i>

01:30.991 --> 01:34.193
She actually thinks that
there's something

01:34.195 --> 01:36.295
kind of darker in here.

01:36.297 --> 01:39.131
There's been all kinds
of things that have gone on
in this building.

01:39.133 --> 01:43.102
I mean, it used to be
a mortuary,
it was a Mason's lodge.

01:43.104 --> 01:47.739
<i>  The Free and Accepted Masons</i>
<i>  is the largest secret society</i>
<i>  in the world.</i>

01:47.741 --> 01:50.809
<i>  Their history dates</i>
<i>  back to the Crusades.</i>

01:50.811 --> 01:54.580
<i>  Members even include</i>
<i>  the founding fathers</i>
<i>  of the United States,</i>

01:54.582 --> 01:58.050
<i>  and their secret symbols</i>
<i>  are visible everywhere.</i>

01:58.052 --> 02:00.119
<i>  But little is known</i>
<i>  about their rituals,</i>

02:00.121 --> 02:03.655
<i>  or their supposed fascination</i>
<i>  with death and the afterlife.</i>

02:05.192 --> 02:06.959
So, they're very ritualistic.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.427
And that intention,
in the space,

02:08.429 --> 02:11.063
as we have learned and have
used in investigations

02:11.065 --> 02:12.431
can have a lasting effect.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.299
And they're extremely
protective

02:14.301 --> 02:17.503
of their secrets
and of their buildings.

02:17.505 --> 02:21.907
And so, I feel like
we should probably
tread lightly initially

02:21.909 --> 02:23.642
and try to gain their trust.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.345
All right,
so why don't we go in,
we'll chat with Lorrie.

02:27.882 --> 02:32.384
<i>  You've got morgue, Masons,</i>
<i>  place filled with antiques.</i>

02:32.386 --> 02:34.319
-[Adam] Yeah.
-Scared owner.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.693
So, this is just one floor.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.964
Lorrie.

02:45.966 --> 02:46.865
-Hello.
-Hey.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.033
-Hi, I'm Amy.
-How are you?

02:48.035 --> 02:49.201
-Good to meet you.
-Good to meet you.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.235
Adam, nice to see you.

02:50.237 --> 02:52.004
Welcome to the old
Masonic building.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.872
-[Adam] Thank you.
-This is something else.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.941
[Lorrie] Built in 1892.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.409
A lot of energy here.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.211
This is the antique store,
right?

02:59.213 --> 03:01.246
Is this just this floor?

03:01.248 --> 03:03.649
-It goes all the way
to the back.
-Oh, it does.

03:03.651 --> 03:06.552
In my very back room
is a Victorian parlor,

03:06.554 --> 03:08.287
which was once
a funeral parlor.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.355
Okay. Okay.

03:10.357 --> 03:13.692
How long has activity been
going on here?

03:13.694 --> 03:15.661
-I've been here for 13 years.
-Mmm-hmm.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.161
So, it's 13 years.

03:17.163 --> 03:21.166
I was in a small shop
in the same Masonic building
for seven years,

03:21.168 --> 03:22.668
then I moved over here
when it got--

03:22.670 --> 03:25.771
-Oh, I see.
-Oh, you were like
a couple doors down?

03:25.773 --> 03:27.005
-Yeah.
-Okay.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.640
-Ah, okay.
-And there was
a lot of activity there.

03:30.211 --> 03:31.677
Do you think
it's all connected?

03:31.679 --> 03:32.978
-Definitely.
-Okay.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.146
Yeah.

03:34.148 --> 03:37.082
I know, it's the energy
in the walls, in the floors,

03:37.084 --> 03:39.384
in the woodwork,
and in the items.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.153
-Right.
-Right, that's what
we were gonna ask about.

03:41.155 --> 03:42.154
Yeah.

03:42.156 --> 03:43.989
Have you had any activity
surrounding things

03:43.991 --> 03:45.357
that are in your shop?

03:45.359 --> 03:47.492
This little perfume.

03:47.494 --> 03:50.229
A customer came in.
He picks it up.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.730
Smells it.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.299
-I could smell the perfume.
-Yeah.

03:54.301 --> 03:57.603
I opened it up and I said,
"This perfume is empty."

03:59.139 --> 04:02.040
This type of thing happens
here a lot.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.210
Definitely doesn't smell.

04:05.212 --> 04:07.045
-It doesn't have a smell?
-No.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.580
[Lorrie] No, no odor at all.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.083
Let's head back that way,
shall we?

04:11.085 --> 04:13.685
Yeah, seems like
there's a lot more to look at.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.123
<i>  What was this room?</i>

04:18.125 --> 04:20.292
This was Prophet & Flynn
funeral parlor.

04:20.294 --> 04:23.829
People have been touched here
on the shoulder.

04:23.831 --> 04:27.332
People tell me
that they got pushed.

04:27.334 --> 04:30.302
I had my Victorian bonnet on,

04:30.304 --> 04:34.573
I walked through the door,
and something yanked it
right off my head.

04:36.210 --> 04:39.244
Okay, so should we head
to the other shop?

04:41.949 --> 04:43.181
Before we go
to the other shop,

04:43.183 --> 04:45.317
this is the basement,

04:45.319 --> 04:49.621
which I'm not going down
because it's kind of
a creepy place.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.256
The last tenant that was here,

04:51.258 --> 04:54.226
she got sick to her stomach
going down the stairs once.

04:54.228 --> 04:55.927
She was really shaken.

04:55.929 --> 04:56.928
-Okay. All right.
-All right.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.063
We will go down there
for sure.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.098
-Basement on the list.
-You don't wanna miss it.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.933
The older shop,
that way, right?

05:01.935 --> 05:03.201
-Yeah.
-Okay.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.672
[dramatic music playing]

05:09.510 --> 05:11.877
This at one time
was my antique shop.

05:11.879 --> 05:12.778
-Okay.
-Okay.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.146
This area,

05:14.148 --> 05:16.815
there were some people in here
and they were putting

05:16.817 --> 05:17.849
the sprinkler system in.

05:17.851 --> 05:21.019
And the kid who's holding
the ladder got pushed.

05:22.856 --> 05:28.060
Also, a woman came in the shop
one day and she said,

05:28.062 --> 05:30.295
"I'd like you to come
and visit our church."

05:30.297 --> 05:32.864
She told me
it was in a Masonic building.

05:32.866 --> 05:36.134
I said, "Is your
Masonic building
as nice as here?"

05:36.136 --> 05:38.870
And she said,
"Every bit as nice."

05:38.872 --> 05:41.239
The next thing I know,
this woman is on the floor.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.110
She was visibly shaken.

05:45.112 --> 05:48.246
And she said, "She felt
something push
her left shoulder."

05:48.248 --> 05:49.314
Wow.

05:49.316 --> 05:52.384
I think she touched this
nerve that the Masons

05:52.386 --> 05:56.321
didn't want someone saying,
our Masonic building...

05:56.323 --> 05:57.522
-[Amy] Yeah.
-...is better than yours.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.927
We know, there's just
so many unanswered questions

06:01.929 --> 06:03.795
over the period of time.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.164
I think there could have been
a lot of negativity

06:06.166 --> 06:08.633
because of Masonic rituals
and stuff.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.971
-All right.
-Well, okay.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.940
So, should we go upstairs?

06:18.946 --> 06:21.580
[Adam] This is really cool
right here.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.350
This is where
the temple was...

06:25.352 --> 06:26.818
-Right.
-The Masons.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.087
[Amy] Whoa, now that's...

06:29.089 --> 06:31.289
[Adam] Wow, this space
is huge.

06:31.291 --> 06:36.261
In this area, a few people
have seen a shadow person.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.896
[Amy] Do the Masons
still use this

06:37.898 --> 06:39.064
or when did they stop
using it?

06:39.066 --> 06:41.400
No, it was sold in the 1980s.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.834
Okay.

06:42.836 --> 06:46.371
When I first moved in,
this was the room,
I felt like

06:46.373 --> 06:48.273
there was a crowd
watching me.

06:48.275 --> 06:49.674
Okay.

06:49.676 --> 06:52.310
It felt like the Masons
were letting me know that,

06:52.312 --> 06:54.312
"Hey, this is a guy place."

06:54.314 --> 06:56.314
The energy was
a little bit more negative.

06:56.316 --> 06:58.550
[dramatic music playing]

07:00.087 --> 07:01.286
<i> [Adam] Lorrie was convinced</i>

07:01.288 --> 07:03.755
<i>  that there is</i>
<i>  aggressive activity</i>

07:03.757 --> 07:05.290
<i>  connected to the Masons.</i>

07:05.292 --> 07:07.025
<i>  And we have</i>
<i>  a lot of ground to cover.</i>

07:07.027 --> 07:08.193
<i>  This place is huge.</i>

07:08.195 --> 07:10.562
<i>  So, we have</i>
<i>  a lot of work to do.</i>

07:14.968 --> 07:16.835
<i>  Our friend Shawn</i>
<i>  is gonna come by.</i>

07:16.837 --> 07:19.237
He is a Freemason.
He's local to the area.

07:19.239 --> 07:22.073
And he's been a Mason
for a number of years.

07:22.075 --> 07:26.144
<i>  It seems like</i>
<i>  they're very heavily invested</i>
<i>  in the idea</i>

07:26.146 --> 07:27.679
<i>  that Masons</i>
<i>  are haunting this building.</i>

07:27.681 --> 07:30.415
And so, we just
wanna find out
more about them

07:30.417 --> 07:31.983
before we just assume
that's the case

07:31.985 --> 07:34.786
or that they had
anything negative

07:34.788 --> 07:36.521
going on here
in the first place.

07:36.523 --> 07:39.658
So, Shawn, thank you
for joining us here

07:39.660 --> 07:41.026
in this Masonic Temple.

07:41.028 --> 07:45.263
How protective are Masons
of their secrets?

07:45.265 --> 07:48.033
So, we do take what they call
an obligation

07:48.035 --> 07:49.901
to never disclose the secrets.

07:49.903 --> 07:52.037
I mean, our ceremonies
are ceremonies

07:52.039 --> 07:55.173
that have been done
from the beginning of time,
our forefathers.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.942
My particular lodge

07:56.944 --> 08:00.912
and the lodge that
this particular lodge
formed with

08:00.914 --> 08:03.048
is actually charted
by Paul Revere.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.215
Oh!

08:04.217 --> 08:05.917
Freemasonry goes back to the,
the days of the Crusades

08:05.919 --> 08:07.886
with the Knights Templar.

08:07.888 --> 08:11.523
Do you feel like
maybe Freemasons now
are a little more casual

08:11.525 --> 08:13.225
versus how they used to be?

08:13.227 --> 08:14.392
Absolutely.

08:14.394 --> 08:17.329
So, to become a Mason
back in that time,

08:17.331 --> 08:19.097
they had to know somebody.

08:19.099 --> 08:22.133
So, specifically here,
they think the Masons

08:22.135 --> 08:24.469
in this building
are very protective
of their space.

08:24.471 --> 08:27.906
Yeah. Especially if they pass,
while this was still active.

08:27.908 --> 08:28.974
Yeah.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.443
The spirit or whatever
was probably here

08:31.445 --> 08:34.846
during lodge meetings,
sitting in the chair
watching meetings happen.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.081
-Yeah. Right.
-Mmm-hmm.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.148
There's some activity here

08:37.150 --> 08:40.185
that they keep associating
with the Masons.

08:40.187 --> 08:44.089
One of which is people keep
getting like pushed on
one shoulder or something.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.857
-Yes.
-Okay.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.894
So, there is a,
a part of the ceremony

08:48.896 --> 08:52.330
where it does something
along those lines.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.565
Wow. Okay.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.101
[dramatic music playing]

08:59.039 --> 09:01.473
<i> [Amy] We're about to pass</i>
<i>  the reins to Shawn.</i>

09:01.475 --> 09:04.609
<i>  He is going upstairs to use</i>
<i>  the former Masonic Temple</i>

09:04.611 --> 09:06.311
<i>  to wake up these spirits.</i>

09:06.313 --> 09:09.314
<i>  The ritual he is performing</i>
<i>  is so secretive</i>

09:09.316 --> 09:11.283
<i> that he's unplugged his audio.</i>

09:11.285 --> 09:12.651
<i>  He'll have no crew with him.</i>

09:12.653 --> 09:14.686
<i>  Only security cameras.</i>

09:16.290 --> 09:18.557
[dramatic music playing]

09:26.066 --> 09:29.267
He's unplugging his audio.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.573
Yeah, that's him.

09:37.911 --> 09:42.614
[Adam] Why do I feel like
the energy has shifted?

09:50.157 --> 09:52.657
Just waiting for
one of these chairs to,
like, push out.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.228
I think, yeah, he's coming.

10:01.168 --> 10:04.669
Okay, so
how was that up there?

10:04.671 --> 10:07.672
I just reiterated the fact
that I'm a Mason.

10:07.674 --> 10:08.974
Yeah, sure. Okay.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.042
Tried to say some keywords.

10:11.044 --> 10:15.280
I got that chill, that weird,
like, something was around.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.816
But nothing made itself
apparent, really.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.150
-Okay.
-Okay.

10:19.152 --> 10:22.287
<i> [Amy] We're hoping</i>
<i>  Shawn's keywords</i>
<i>  woke up the Masons</i>

10:22.289 --> 10:24.289
<i> in this building and made them</i>
<i>  more forthcoming.</i>

10:24.291 --> 10:27.926
<i>  Now, we're going downstairs</i>
<i>  to Lorrie's old shop</i>

10:27.928 --> 10:30.228
<i>  where the violent</i>
<i>  shoving incident occurred,</i>

10:30.230 --> 10:32.497
<i>  to question</i>
<i>  these potential masons.</i>

10:40.240 --> 10:42.307
There's been issues
in this area before

10:42.309 --> 10:44.075
where people have been
pushed on the,

10:44.077 --> 10:46.177
the left shoulder
specifically.

10:46.179 --> 10:49.047
So that's why we thought
we would bring you
in here and see.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.316
So, I'm gonna do
a quick EVP session here.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.151
I'm just gonna ask
right off the bat.

10:53.153 --> 10:58.823
So, to whoever is in here,
we brought
our friend Shawn here.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.425
<i> [Adam] We wanted</i>
<i>  to bring Shawn over here</i>

11:00.427 --> 11:02.394
<i>  because Shawn is a Mason.</i>

11:03.797 --> 11:06.031
Shawn, is there anything
that you could say

11:06.033 --> 11:09.534
that we could hear
that would encourage
a fellow Mason to talk?

11:11.505 --> 11:14.172
Say Brother Hiram.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.776
If you are a brother,
you know what that means.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.145
Tell us you are a brother.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.283
[Adam] We really want you
to communicate with us

11:25.285 --> 11:26.251
and let us know who you are.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.319
For Lorrie's sake.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.158
Let's listen to this.
It's been running.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.895
<i>  We brought</i>
<i>  our friend Shawn here.</i>

11:36.897 --> 11:40.398
<i>  We wanted to bring Shawn over</i>
<i> here because Shawn is a Mason.</i>

11:40.400 --> 11:42.500
[dramatic music playing]

11:51.278 --> 11:53.111
Shawn, does that sound
familiar to you?

11:53.113 --> 11:56.147
<i>  We bought our friend Shawn</i>
<i>  here.</i>

11:56.149 --> 11:59.984
<i>  We wanted to bring Shawn over</i>
<i> here because Shawn is a Mason.</i>

12:00.954 --> 12:02.654
<i>  Shawn is there anything</i>
<i>  you could say--</i>

12:02.656 --> 12:05.490
It's like, so hard to hear,
it's like somebody is speaking

12:05.492 --> 12:08.026
but they're not giving off
that energy that--

12:08.028 --> 12:10.929
Not at all. Not territorial.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.431
<i>  If you're a brother,</i>
<i>  you know what that means.</i>

12:13.433 --> 12:15.433
<i>  Tell us you are a brother.</i>

12:16.670 --> 12:18.269
<i>  I know.</i>

12:18.271 --> 12:19.838
Yeah, no.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.072
He would have said
something, right?

12:21.074 --> 12:24.642
<i>  We really want you</i>
<i>  to communicate with us</i>

12:24.644 --> 12:27.846
<i>  and let us know</i>
<i>  who you are,</i>
<i>  for Lorrie's sake.</i>

12:27.848 --> 12:29.247
I don't think they're a Mason.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.381
I don't either.

12:30.383 --> 12:33.852
Maybe there is a Mason
somewhere in this building.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.954
But there has not been
anyone who's a Mason

12:35.956 --> 12:37.288
who's made themselves
known to us.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.325
<i>  We brought in a mason</i>
<i>  who brought up, like,</i>

12:40.327 --> 12:42.994
<i>  Masonic rituals, and nothing.</i>

12:42.996 --> 12:46.064
That's not to say there's not
a lingering Freemason

12:46.066 --> 12:47.365
in this building
every once in a while,

12:47.367 --> 12:49.601
<i>  but we didn't get a response.</i>

12:51.104 --> 12:52.570
[dramatic music playing]

12:57.377 --> 12:58.710
<i> [Amy] Today,</i>
<i>  we're gonna bring Chip in</i>

12:58.712 --> 12:59.878
<i>  on the investigation</i>

12:59.880 --> 13:02.747
<i>  because since we've got</i>
<i>  a lot of possibilities here.</i>

13:02.749 --> 13:06.217
<i>  And so, we were thinking</i>
<i>  that if he uses</i>
<i>  some remote viewing skills,</i>

13:06.219 --> 13:08.052
<i>  he might be able to see</i>
<i>  what we're seeing</i>

13:08.054 --> 13:11.990
<i>  but also feel what could be</i>
<i>  going on in that space.</i>

13:14.895 --> 13:17.529
Hey, Chip, what have you
picked up so far?

13:17.531 --> 13:21.065
What I picked up,
is disgrace,

13:21.067 --> 13:23.067
no respect for the dead.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.836
Hmm.

13:24.838 --> 13:29.240
So, someone's done something
that is disrespectful
to the dead.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.510
I don't know
what that's all about.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.878
Okay.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.880
Is there any--
are you picking up
anything else?

13:35.882 --> 13:37.949
Or can we show you the space
that we're in now?

13:37.951 --> 13:39.384
<i>  Please do.</i>

13:42.055 --> 13:44.622
<i>  There's a lot of stuff</i>
<i>  in this space.</i>

13:46.359 --> 13:48.226
There could be enough ghosts
attached to this place

13:48.228 --> 13:51.029
to haunt
half of North America.

13:52.966 --> 13:53.932
<i> [Lorrie] This was the room.</i>

13:53.934 --> 13:57.669
I felt like
there was a crowd
watching me.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.439
<i> All right, can I just tell you</i>
<i>  what I'm being told?</i>

14:01.441 --> 14:02.507
<i>  Yeah.</i>

14:02.509 --> 14:04.275
Take me downstairs.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.110
Okay, here we go.

14:13.787 --> 14:15.320
Whoa!

14:16.857 --> 14:20.692
Something just yelled
very loudly,
"Get the [bleep] out!"

14:20.694 --> 14:22.293
[dramatic music playing]

14:23.930 --> 14:26.664
And is this different energy
than you felt

14:26.666 --> 14:28.233
in the rest of the building?

14:28.235 --> 14:30.134
-Uh-huh.
<i>  -Okay.</i>

14:30.136 --> 14:31.903
Do we know
if it's male or female?

14:31.905 --> 14:33.705
-Oh, it's a man.
<i>  -It's man. Yeah.</i>

14:34.975 --> 14:38.476
Whatever is there,
is very, like, territorial.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.646
Yeah. Okay.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.282
That's like...
that's the perfect word
for the whole building.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.950
-Yeah.
-Okay.

14:45.952 --> 14:49.320
Is there anything else
you think we need to know or--

14:49.322 --> 14:51.522
I don't get anything else
in there just like,

14:51.524 --> 14:53.758
"This is... this is my turf,
get the hell out."

14:53.760 --> 14:55.059
Okay.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.929
<i>  We want to take you</i>
<i>  one more place.</i>

14:57.931 --> 14:59.197
Okay.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.969
I'm really sad in this space.

15:04.971 --> 15:06.537
[Adam] What kind of sadness
is it?

15:08.141 --> 15:09.641
I don't know.
Like an ending.

15:09.643 --> 15:11.242
Okay.

15:16.883 --> 15:21.219
<i>  All right. We're getting</i>
<i>  into some, some</i>
<i>  dark stuff here, kids.</i>

15:21.221 --> 15:24.122
<i> Do you know if this building's</i>
<i>  ever been used</i>

15:24.124 --> 15:27.392
for temporary morgues
and stuff like that?

15:28.795 --> 15:30.595
Yes, but it wasn't temporary.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.631
So, has this been
a funeral home?

15:35.302 --> 15:37.135
Uh, yes.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.569
Uh, yes, it was.

15:41.508 --> 15:45.910
<i>  There's just something</i>
<i>  that's there</i>
<i>  with the whole morgue,</i>

15:45.912 --> 15:47.145
funeral home something.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.212
Okay.

15:48.214 --> 15:49.280
[Chip]
<i>  And the whole dark thing</i>

15:49.282 --> 15:51.950
<i>  is someone showed disrespect</i>
<i>  to the dead.</i>

15:53.286 --> 15:55.386
Take a deep dive
because there's a lot of stuff

15:55.388 --> 15:56.654
-going on in this building.
<i>  -Yeah.</i>

15:56.656 --> 15:58.189
Yeah, that's we were thinking.

16:00.927 --> 16:03.094
<i>  Chip picked up</i>
<i>  on some disturbing energy</i>

16:03.096 --> 16:05.096
<i>  in the former funeral home.</i>

16:05.098 --> 16:07.098
<i>  We need to dig</i>
<i>  into the business,</i>

16:07.100 --> 16:10.635
<i>  the former owners,</i>
<i>  and any possible incidents</i>
<i>  there.</i>

16:11.938 --> 16:14.372
<i>  We're meeting with Wayne Nye,</i>
<i>  a local historian</i>

16:14.374 --> 16:17.575
<i>  and genealogist</i>
<i>  who has conducted</i>
<i>  extensive research</i>

16:17.577 --> 16:20.211
<i>  on the 130-year-old building.</i>

16:21.681 --> 16:25.149
All right, so, Wayne,
can you give us kind of
a high-level overview of...

16:25.151 --> 16:27.752
of what that building is
and how it came to be?

16:27.754 --> 16:33.291
The building that you ran
was built on April 6, 1881.

16:33.293 --> 16:38.096
There was over 60 different
businesses in there
since it was built.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.431
Yeah, I saw... I was doing
some research and I saw

16:40.433 --> 16:42.266
there was like
a bicycle shop.

16:42.268 --> 16:43.401
There was a shoe store.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.103
Yes.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.672
Clearly, there was
the undertakers
that were there.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.608
The first undertaker in there
was Prophet & Flynn.

16:50.610 --> 16:55.847
And they opened in April 1st,
1902 to July of 1903.

16:55.849 --> 17:00.151
And they handled 15 corpses
while they were there
in the building.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.420
And this is
the death certificate
for David Ross.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.322
Undertaker Drake. Correct.

17:04.324 --> 17:07.225
He was a second undertaker
on the building.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.994
He originally
was a meat cutter,

17:09.996 --> 17:11.963
two doors down
from the Masonic building,

17:11.965 --> 17:14.699
then he became
a state licensed embalmer.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.102
-Interesting, I mean--
-What a transition?

17:18.104 --> 17:19.137
A little, little bizarre.

17:19.139 --> 17:20.872
[Adam] Yeah.

17:20.874 --> 17:26.244
He got married in 1904,
they had a daughter
Zillah Marian Drake,

17:26.246 --> 17:30.114
and she passed away in 1906.

17:30.116 --> 17:32.984
And she was waked
and embalmed by her father.

17:34.254 --> 17:37.121
It seemed like he was running
from something or someone.

17:37.123 --> 17:39.190
They moved to Brockton
for a year.

17:39.192 --> 17:42.560
And then I tracked him down
to La Crosse, Wisconsin.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.561
Right.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.364
But when he was in Wisconsin
every year,

17:46.366 --> 17:49.100
the undertaking establishment
and his residence

17:49.102 --> 17:51.235
were at a different address

17:51.237 --> 17:53.771
in the directories like
he was running
from something or someone.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.306
Right.

17:55.308 --> 17:58.076
There was an article
in the paper that said
he was giving up his business

17:58.078 --> 18:00.912
due to ill health
and going west to raise cattle

18:00.914 --> 18:02.447
but that's
a very strenuous job,

18:02.449 --> 18:04.248
so how are you gonna raise
cattle?

18:07.120 --> 18:08.186
Then he disappeared.

18:08.188 --> 18:11.122
I tracked him down
to Providence, Rhode Island,

18:11.124 --> 18:13.458
where again he was involved
in undertaking.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.293
[Amy] Interesting.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.861
When did David Ross
leave again?

18:16.863 --> 18:20.031
He left here in 1908.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.435
<i> [Amy] Did Drake run away</i>
<i>  from here with a secret</i>

18:24.437 --> 18:26.804
<i>  or was he hiding something?</i>

18:26.806 --> 18:29.774
So, anything happened in 1907
that you know of

18:29.776 --> 18:33.010
that would make him like go,
"Okay, I'm gonna leave now."

18:34.147 --> 18:35.880
To be honest with you,
I'm not sure.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.682
[dramatic music playing]

18:48.528 --> 18:51.262
[Amy] This was
the actual funeral parlor.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.197
[Adam] Yes.

18:53.199 --> 18:55.366
[Amy] Right now,
we're just gonna try
to set this up

18:55.368 --> 18:58.302
as much like a funeral parlor
as we can.

18:58.304 --> 19:02.340
Thankfully, they have
a lot of that already done.

19:02.342 --> 19:06.277
<i>  But we've got candles lit,</i>
<i>  there's some funeral signs.</i>

19:06.279 --> 19:08.613
<i>  We're just gonna</i>
<i>  kind of try to bring it back</i>

19:08.615 --> 19:12.083
<i>  to what it would have been</i>
<i>  when it was operating</i>
<i>  as a funeral home.</i>

19:12.085 --> 19:15.553
<i>  We compiled a list of</i>
<i>  Undertaker Drake's</i>
<i>  embalmed bodies</i>

19:15.555 --> 19:18.990
<i>  from the documents</i>
<i>  Wayne Nye gave us.</i>

19:18.992 --> 19:23.294
<i> [Adam] So, we are putting</i>
<i>  equipment on top of them</i>

19:23.296 --> 19:26.097
<i>  to reference them</i>
<i>  and maybe</i>
<i>  the equipment will go off.</i>

19:26.099 --> 19:29.066
<i> [Amy] We'll use</i>
<i>  the death certificates</i>
<i>  as trigger objects</i>

19:29.068 --> 19:33.137
<i>  to see if we can unlock</i>
<i>  who Chip said</i>
<i>  disrespected the dead.</i>

19:36.042 --> 19:39.443
So, should we, um,
sit in our funeral here?

19:39.445 --> 19:41.012
Yeah.

19:42.248 --> 19:43.948
I have the recorder.

19:45.952 --> 19:46.851
[sighs]

19:46.853 --> 19:48.653
Okay, here we go.

19:51.057 --> 19:56.561
Whoever's in here with us,
there are death certificates
on the ground.

19:58.765 --> 20:01.065
David Ross Drake.

20:01.067 --> 20:06.270
He embalmed
all of those bodies
in the center there.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.542
I don't know
if you're familiar with those.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.346
Do you recognize
any of those?

20:15.348 --> 20:18.649
If you do, can you touch
that green light on the floor?

20:21.754 --> 20:25.556
This is David Ross Drake's
own death certificate.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.860
If you recognize
that death certificate,

20:29.862 --> 20:31.896
can you touch
that funeral sign

20:31.898 --> 20:35.399
and make that black box
light up?

20:35.401 --> 20:37.535
[music playing]

20:42.942 --> 20:44.342
It's so quiet.

20:49.382 --> 20:52.984
Did David Ross Drake
disrespect the dead?

20:56.623 --> 21:00.091
Was David Ross Drake
an honest man?

21:01.928 --> 21:07.698
Do you think that
he ever tried
anything illegal or unsavory?

21:10.403 --> 21:13.971
Did you know David Ross Drake

21:13.973 --> 21:18.309
in passing and in,
in the community?

21:20.380 --> 21:23.147
If this isn't the place
for us to be looking,

21:23.149 --> 21:28.486
where should we go
to investigate
to find our answers?

21:31.758 --> 21:34.191
Or if we would like to speak
with whoever's here
who's nonliving,

21:34.193 --> 21:36.627
what do we need to do
to make you trust us?

21:38.931 --> 21:41.232
Is there anything
we can do to help you?

21:44.137 --> 21:48.906
<i> [Amy] Did David Ross Drake</i>
<i>  disrespect the dead?</i>

21:48.908 --> 21:50.074
[recording playing]

21:50.076 --> 21:51.642
David.

21:55.315 --> 21:56.847
Is it, they did or David?

21:56.849 --> 22:00.318

22:00.320 --> 22:01.986

I hear David,
and I hear they did.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.290
-Yeah.
-I hear both.

22:06.292 --> 22:10.961
<i> [Amy] Was David Ross</i>
<i>  an honest man?</i>

22:10.963 --> 22:16.967
<i>  Do you think</i>
<i>  that he ever tried</i>
<i>  anything illegal or unsavory?</i>

22:16.969 --> 22:21.172
<i> [Adam] Did you know</i>
<i>  David Ross Drake in passing</i>

22:21.174 --> 22:23.407
<i>  and in, in the community?</i>

22:23.409 --> 22:24.308
[recording playing]

22:24.310 --> 22:26.344
I did, listen.

22:26.346 --> 22:30.548
<i> [Adam] Did you know</i>
<i>  David Ross Drake</i>
<i>  in passing</i>

22:30.550 --> 22:32.917
<i>  and in, in the community?</i>

22:32.919 --> 22:34.018
[recording playing]

22:34.020 --> 22:36.253
-Mmm-hmm.
-I did.

22:37.657 --> 22:40.057
I mean, even though
we're referencing this person,

22:40.059 --> 22:41.092
it doesn't tell us
if it is this person.

22:41.094 --> 22:42.559
Yeah.

22:42.561 --> 22:46.330
<i> [Adam] Where should we go</i>
<i>  to investigate</i>
<i>  to find our answers?</i>

22:46.332 --> 22:47.665
[recording playing]

22:47.667 --> 22:49.400
-Down.
-I could say it's down.

22:49.402 --> 22:52.336
<i> [Amy] We would like</i>
<i>  to speak with whoever's here</i>
<i>  who's nonliving,</i>

22:52.338 --> 22:54.972
<i>  what do we need to do</i>
<i>  to make you trust us?</i>

22:54.974 --> 22:57.174
<i>  Is there anything</i>
<i>  we can do to help you?</i>

22:58.311 --> 23:00.444
[recording playing]

23:00.446 --> 23:03.347
No, it did say they did.

23:05.017 --> 23:06.350
But who is they?

23:07.420 --> 23:09.453
-It doesn't really
give us any...
<i>  -No.</i>

23:09.455 --> 23:11.255
...indication of who it is.

23:11.257 --> 23:14.091
I mean,
we are getting some stuff,

23:14.093 --> 23:17.228
but we have no evidence
of any kind,

23:17.230 --> 23:21.232
showing David Ross Drake
being malicious of intent.

23:22.368 --> 23:24.335
It did say down though,
and that's the basement.

23:24.337 --> 23:26.704
The basement.

23:26.706 --> 23:30.174
[Adam] And the Chip said,
disrespectful to the dead.

23:30.176 --> 23:33.544
Yeah. So, we've got to find
out what all that means.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.946
<i>  We still need to figure out</i>
<i>  what this energy is.</i>

23:35.948 --> 23:39.016
<i>  And that's the hardest piece</i>
<i>  of this puzzle.</i>

23:39.018 --> 23:41.819
<i>  So again,</i>
<i> left with a million questions.</i>

23:41.821 --> 23:43.320
<i>  What's this negative energy?</i>

23:43.322 --> 23:45.456
<i>  What is happening?</i>
<i>  And why is it connected</i>
<i>  to this space?</i>

23:45.458 --> 23:48.125
And we still have
to figure that out.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.327
[dramatic music playing]

23:56.135 --> 23:57.368
-Hey, so Adam...
-What?

23:57.370 --> 24:00.004
I just got a text from Chip.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.138
You're not gonna believe
what he said.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.907
What?

24:02.909 --> 24:07.278
He says,
I got a message for you.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.146
The dead are in the basement.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.481
Oh.

24:10.483 --> 24:12.550
[recording playing]

24:16.389 --> 24:18.656
-Down.
-Think it says down.

24:18.658 --> 24:19.790
That's so crazy.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.091
I know.

24:21.093 --> 24:23.794
I mean, maybe
that's where we should start.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.229
I think we should.

24:29.001 --> 24:32.970
<i>  Chip Coffey texted us saying</i>
<i>  the dead are in the basement.</i>

24:32.972 --> 24:35.973
<i>  So, we are gonna start</i>
<i>  tonight down there</i>

24:35.975 --> 24:39.076
<i>  and see if we can get</i>
<i>  some answers</i>
<i>  as to what's going on here.</i>

24:43.249 --> 24:45.449
<i> [Adam] We are going</i>
<i>  to do a spirit box session</i>

24:45.451 --> 24:48.686
<i>  to see if we get</i>
<i>  more information</i>
<i>  because something is going on</i>

24:48.688 --> 24:50.921
<i>  and we got to figure it out.</i>

24:50.923 --> 24:53.123
And I'm good.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.293
So, if there's anybody
down here,

24:56.295 --> 25:00.431
my friend Amy
is listening to something
that you can talk to.

25:00.433 --> 25:06.070
So, if you could speak
into the device
that Amy has in her hand,

25:06.072 --> 25:07.438
she will hear you talk.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.909
First and foremost,

25:11.911 --> 25:14.478
I feel it's impolite
to not know

25:14.480 --> 25:15.412
that my name is Adam.

25:15.414 --> 25:16.914
Lorrie.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.382
Lorrie?

25:21.220 --> 25:22.319
What about Lorrie?

25:25.358 --> 25:27.091
Emporium.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.995
Oh, she has the shop upstairs.
Yeah.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.430
Was that your space?

25:36.235 --> 25:38.135
Did you have
the funeral parlor up there?

25:38.137 --> 25:39.870
He's gone.

25:39.872 --> 25:43.207
He is gone. The person
that had a funeral parlor
upstairs is gone.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.909
Did you know him?

25:44.911 --> 25:47.144
Did you?

25:47.146 --> 25:49.013
I did not know him. No.

25:49.015 --> 25:50.147
No.

25:50.149 --> 25:51.315
Yeah, I'm living.

25:53.352 --> 25:55.853
Whoever's talking to Amy
right now,

25:55.855 --> 25:58.088
I don't know if you know this,
but you're,
you're deceased.

25:58.090 --> 26:01.058
You're no longer
a part of the living.

26:01.060 --> 26:01.959
"I'll come back."

26:01.961 --> 26:03.327
It was a really
creepy whisper

26:03.329 --> 26:05.396
that just said that
and something's touching me.

26:05.398 --> 26:07.331
[dramatic music playing]

26:12.905 --> 26:14.405
Can you not...
don't touch Amy.

26:14.407 --> 26:16.440
That's not okay. Okay?

26:16.442 --> 26:18.042
"I'll come back."

26:19.111 --> 26:20.411
Where are you going?

26:24.016 --> 26:26.984
Don't go anywhere yet.
I wanted to ask you
about Drake.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.119
The undertaker.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.424
Don't, what?
Don't stop talking now.

26:33.426 --> 26:37.194
Look, we're here.
We're, we're all
down here together.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.896
Save us.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.631
-Save us?
-It was like a girl.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.268
How many of you
are down here?

26:44.270 --> 26:46.503
Like in spirit form?
How many of you?

26:48.674 --> 26:50.174
What do you need?

26:52.311 --> 26:54.078
Can you tell me
what you need?

26:54.080 --> 26:55.346
He's coming.

26:57.350 --> 26:59.183
Who is coming?

26:59.185 --> 27:00.818
David.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.519
David Drake is coming?

27:04.023 --> 27:05.689
Did he do something bad here?

27:09.161 --> 27:10.394
Please tell me.

27:10.396 --> 27:11.395
We're only here to help.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.666
What's your name?

27:15.668 --> 27:17.067
I don't want to get it wrong.

27:20.206 --> 27:21.538
Don't stop talking now.

27:23.175 --> 27:26.143
I can't help Lorrie

27:26.145 --> 27:27.444
if you don't answer me.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.048
Was--

27:31.050 --> 27:32.383
-Adam.
-Yeah.

27:36.188 --> 27:37.821
Is this working?

27:37.823 --> 27:42.292
That actually
was really
freakin' interesting.

27:42.294 --> 27:43.794
There were multiple voices.

27:43.796 --> 27:45.963
Yes, that's what I got.

27:45.965 --> 27:47.931
The first thing
you said was Lorrie.

27:47.933 --> 27:49.500
And I said,
what about Lorrie?

27:49.502 --> 27:51.402
And they said emporium?

27:51.404 --> 27:52.336
Oh!

27:52.338 --> 27:53.904
So, then I started
getting more responses

27:53.906 --> 27:56.173
about the funeral home
specifically.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.642
And then you said he's coming.

27:58.644 --> 28:00.344
And I was like,
"Who's coming?"

28:00.346 --> 28:02.079
And then you said, "David."

28:02.081 --> 28:03.881
-I did?
-Yeah.

28:03.883 --> 28:06.750
And I was like, "Okay,
are you here,
like, talk to me,"

28:06.752 --> 28:08.686
and it sort of like
fizzled out then,

28:08.688 --> 28:14.091
but it's as if whatever energy
is in this space
knows about the funeral home,

28:14.093 --> 28:17.895
knew about Lorrie
and David Ross Drake.

28:17.897 --> 28:21.398
<i>  Yet still nothing about</i>
<i>  the aggressive spirit</i>
<i>  down here.</i>

28:22.668 --> 28:26.303
<i>  So, we still should do</i>
<i>  a few experiments down here</i>
<i>  clearly</i>

28:26.305 --> 28:28.072
<i>  to find out more information.</i>

28:32.178 --> 28:34.078
<i>  Let's do some EVP work.</i>

28:37.249 --> 28:41.685
So, whoever is down here
with us who's nonliving,

28:41.687 --> 28:46.090
or who wants to be heard,
this is your chance.

28:47.960 --> 28:51.295
Did anything happen
in this basement

28:51.297 --> 28:55.632
that was illegal
or kept secret?

28:58.270 --> 29:02.139
Potentially, there are people
buried in this basement

29:02.141 --> 29:05.209
and we would love to do right
by them or you.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.914
We're just trying
to collect information.

29:10.916 --> 29:15.285
And we're trying to make sure
that no one
was left down here.

29:18.157 --> 29:21.625
There was
a funeral home upstairs.

29:24.663 --> 29:29.633
Did someone who was running
that funeral home bury bodies
in the basement?

29:32.738 --> 29:34.638
All right. Let's listen here.

29:37.576 --> 29:41.678
<i> [Amy] So, whoever is down here</i>

about that because--

30:40.439 --> 30:42.339
Yeah, let's ask more.

30:46.011 --> 30:49.213
Are you the only one
who was left down here?

30:53.986 --> 30:58.555
Did someone leave you
down here...

31:00.392 --> 31:02.960
and then you died?

31:02.962 --> 31:07.631
Or were you already dead
and they put you down here?

31:11.003 --> 31:14.271
We need you to tell us
your name, please.

31:16.942 --> 31:19.476
Can you tell us
what year this happened?

31:19.478 --> 31:21.011

If you had to tell us
on your own,

31:26.151 --> 31:29.152
if you were to say front,
this is the front part,

31:29.154 --> 31:30.254
this is the middle part,

31:30.256 --> 31:31.388
that's the back part,

31:31.390 --> 31:34.391
where is your body at?

31:34.393 --> 31:35.792

That's crazy.

32:15.668 --> 32:16.967
-Seven.
-Seven.

32:16.969 --> 32:19.937
Like, would they say seven,
like is that 1907?

32:19.939 --> 32:21.505
Would they say seven?

32:21.507 --> 32:26.109
So, anything happened in 1907
that you know of
that would make him like go,

32:26.111 --> 32:27.044
"Okay, I'm gonna leave."

32:27.046 --> 32:28.378
I don't know.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.714
<i>  If you had to tell us</i>

32:38.924 --> 32:40.257
-Ooh.
-Did he say, "Back"?

32:40.259 --> 32:41.291
-Yeah.
-He said back.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.592
Which is back in that creepy--

32:43.996 --> 32:44.962
Back.

32:44.964 --> 32:48.799
Okay, so I would say
ample EVPs indicating

32:48.801 --> 32:50.334
that there might actually be
a body buried in here.

32:50.336 --> 32:53.303
-Right. And it said back.
-Back.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.872
So, if we bring
like something,

32:55.874 --> 32:58.542
somebody in here to search

32:58.544 --> 33:01.111
and they find something
in the back part
of the basement.

33:01.113 --> 33:02.312
It's gonna be crazy.

33:02.314 --> 33:05.015
Whoa. Okay.

33:05.017 --> 33:07.017
Amy and I were doing
some EVP work in the basement,

33:07.019 --> 33:09.853
and somebody said,
"I was left down here."

33:09.855 --> 33:13.190
I also asked "Where?"
and it said the "Back,"

33:13.192 --> 33:15.792
which was very direct,
it was very specific.

33:15.794 --> 33:17.828
Chip Coffey, who we love
and trust said,

33:17.830 --> 33:19.363
"The dead
are in the basement."

33:19.365 --> 33:22.265
<i>  So, we're bringing a Chip</i>
<i>  into our investigation.</i>

33:22.267 --> 33:25.435
<i>  And if there is a body</i>
<i>  in that basement buried</i>

33:25.437 --> 33:27.137
<i>  even if it's over</i>
<i>  100 years old,</i>

33:27.139 --> 33:30.474
<i>  that could definitely be</i>
<i>  the disrespect for the dead</i>

33:30.476 --> 33:32.142
<i>  that Chip was talking about.</i>

33:34.313 --> 33:35.979
<i> [Amy] Hey, Chip.</i>

33:37.116 --> 33:38.315
<i>  Right now,</i>
<i>  we're in the basement?</i>

33:38.317 --> 33:39.950
[Amy] Uh, yes.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.054
What's in the back?

33:44.056 --> 33:45.288
Back here?

33:50.963 --> 33:52.129
[dramatic music playing]

33:55.701 --> 33:57.134
What?

34:00.239 --> 34:03.006
There's definitely
something there.

34:04.143 --> 34:05.008
What?

34:05.010 --> 34:07.978
<i>  Um,</i>

34:07.980 --> 34:12.849
you have some dead folks
that are gonna do something
in that basement.

34:12.851 --> 34:14.651
Okay.

34:14.653 --> 34:17.387
Remember what I texted you,
I'm hearing that again,

34:17.389 --> 34:18.655
"You'll find the dead
in the basement."

34:22.294 --> 34:23.994
Did somebody die here?

34:27.833 --> 34:29.266
We don't know.

34:31.370 --> 34:34.571
This is just not making
any sense to me.

34:34.573 --> 34:39.142
Again, I'm seeing,
"No respect for the dead."

34:40.145 --> 34:42.012
Okay.

34:42.014 --> 34:43.779
<i>  I mean, we know</i>
<i>  this was a morgue.</i>

34:43.781 --> 34:46.917
<i>  We know this was a mortuary,</i>
<i>  like, there could be bodies</i>
<i>  in the basement.</i>

34:46.919 --> 34:51.221
<i>  But then there could</i>
<i>  also just have been bodies</i>
<i>  stored in the basement,</i>

34:51.223 --> 34:52.889
<i>  before the embalming process.</i>

34:52.891 --> 34:56.093
<i>  And then Chip said,</i>
<i>  "Did someone die here</i>
<i>  in the basement?"</i>

34:56.095 --> 34:58.962
So clearly, there's got to be
something to it.

35:00.799 --> 35:03.133
[dramatic music playing]

35:06.672 --> 35:07.937
<i>  [Amy] You know,</i>
<i>  at this point,</i>

35:07.973 --> 35:10.207
<i>  now we have</i>
<i>  a real-life mystery</i>
<i>  on our hands.</i>

35:10.209 --> 35:13.844
<i>  This has gone beyond</i>
<i>  just finding</i>
<i>  the existence of spirits</i>

35:13.846 --> 35:16.079
and trying to communicate
why they're here to

35:16.081 --> 35:18.381
"There could be a body
in this basement."

35:18.383 --> 35:22.786
And now that just takes
a much more serious turn
for us.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.054
We spoke a little bit.

35:24.056 --> 35:28.291
But basically,
there's a very big rumor
going around

35:28.293 --> 35:31.294
that potentially there are
bodies or body parts

35:31.296 --> 35:33.897
buried in the basement
of this building.

35:33.899 --> 35:36.566
So what's going to happen is,

35:36.568 --> 35:38.001
I'm going to ask Eisen
to search,

35:38.003 --> 35:40.770
Eisen is a nine-year-old
German Shepherd,

35:40.772 --> 35:43.740
and he's done cadaver work
all of his life.

35:43.742 --> 35:45.742
He's trained
to find human scent.

35:45.744 --> 35:48.044
-Yeah.
-And he'll go through
and search.

35:48.046 --> 35:51.348
And once he makes a decision,
if he makes the decision

35:51.350 --> 35:53.283
that there is something there,

35:53.285 --> 35:57.120
such as bones or a grave
or whatever,
he will down at source,

35:57.122 --> 35:58.321
which is what we call
final response.

35:58.323 --> 35:59.256
-Okay.
-Okay.

35:59.258 --> 36:00.924
So, would you like me
to get him?

36:00.926 --> 36:02.526
Yeah, let's go ahead
and get Eisen out.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.227
[dramatic music playing]

36:34.059 --> 36:35.325
So, he's down now?

36:35.327 --> 36:36.359
Yes.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.528
You got to show me
where it is. Show me.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.230
You got to touch it.
Where is it?

36:40.232 --> 36:41.498
[Eisen barking]

36:43.302 --> 36:44.434
Oh.

36:44.436 --> 36:46.102
[dramatic music playing]

36:48.974 --> 36:50.540
I mean.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.342
Well, he's pretty,
he's pretty adamant.

36:52.344 --> 36:53.843
Uh-huh.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.145
-Yeah.
-Okay.

36:55.147 --> 36:58.415
So, that was the only spot
that he showed interest.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.884
-Okay.
-But you have the potential
with the dog...

37:00.886 --> 37:02.686
-Yeah.
-...of having an area.

37:02.688 --> 37:05.255
This bears
further investigation

37:05.257 --> 37:06.189
down at this end
of the basement.

37:06.191 --> 37:07.324
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.626
So, you can have
ground penetrating radar
before we can...

37:09.628 --> 37:12.462
-Okay. Yeah.
-...start to think
about digging.

37:12.464 --> 37:15.398
-So, I guess
that's our next step.
-Yeah. Thank you so much.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.167
-Thanks. Very welcome.
-Appreciate it.

37:17.169 --> 37:21.071
-Yes.
-This dog honed into a spot
in the basement,

37:21.073 --> 37:23.406
in the back part
of the basement
which matches our evidence,

37:23.408 --> 37:26.109
<i>  and it knows</i>
<i>  something is there.</i>

37:26.111 --> 37:29.212
<i>  And so, the next step</i>
<i>  is to bring in an expert</i>

37:29.214 --> 37:31.181
<i>  with a ground</i>
<i>  penetrating radar.</i>

37:31.183 --> 37:33.183
<i>  His name is Sean,</i>
<i>  we used to him</i>
<i>  the valley inn case</i>

37:33.185 --> 37:36.119
he is gonna come in,
he's gonna look to see
if there's anything there.

37:36.121 --> 37:39.689
<i>  If he sees</i>
<i>  something on the radar,</i>

37:39.691 --> 37:43.293
<i>  I think it's gonna open up</i>
<i>  another whole</i>
<i>  can of worms.</i>

37:45.897 --> 37:48.331
And so right off the bat,
I do see something
a little bit shallow.

37:48.333 --> 37:49.499
Okay.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.501
That's three, four feet down.

37:51.503 --> 37:52.669
Okay.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.404
-You can actually see it
on the screen.
-Yeah.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.806
So you see where it changes
the consistency.

37:56.808 --> 38:00.076
-It's, yeah,
like this gray data.
-Mmm-hmm.

38:00.078 --> 38:02.212
So, what you're seeing
is like organic type material?

38:02.214 --> 38:03.480
Yeah.

38:03.482 --> 38:06.249
On this, so it's basically
just a change in the data.

38:06.251 --> 38:07.684
-Yeah.
-Mmm-hmm.

38:07.686 --> 38:10.053
I think especially
right in this area. Here.

38:10.055 --> 38:11.321
Oh, right where the dog--

38:11.323 --> 38:13.123
Right... I mean,
right in this area, I could--

38:13.125 --> 38:15.325
In the earth.

38:15.327 --> 38:19.663
4.5, 5 feet basically in this,
this general area,

38:19.665 --> 38:21.965
we're definitely
catching something.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.867
As far as a tank
or anything like that,

38:23.869 --> 38:25.835
it's not only buried utilities
or anything like that.

38:25.837 --> 38:28.371
So, it's, it's foreign
to the soil.

38:28.373 --> 38:31.808
So, from what we could tell
or what I can tell today,

38:31.810 --> 38:33.910
it could potentially be
something.

38:33.912 --> 38:34.878
We call it an area of concern.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.313
Okay.

38:37.249 --> 38:38.948
[Amy] That's two hits.
Now we've got the dog.

38:38.950 --> 38:41.117
We've got the ground
penetrating radar.

38:41.119 --> 38:44.054
We should probably call
the authorities.

38:45.724 --> 38:48.858
This is a very unusual
reveal day.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.328
Normally, we would come in,
we would present our findings

38:51.330 --> 38:55.098
to the client
and give them advice,

38:55.100 --> 38:57.167
<i>  but we also got evidence</i>
<i>  that suggests</i>

38:57.169 --> 38:58.234
<i>  there could be a body</i>
<i>  down there.</i>

38:58.236 --> 39:00.503
<i>  So, there are steps</i>
<i>  that you have to take.</i>

39:00.505 --> 39:03.073
But bottom line,
we have a lot to tell Lorrie.

39:03.075 --> 39:05.108
All right, Miss Lorrie,

39:05.110 --> 39:06.810
you have
a very haunted building

39:06.812 --> 39:08.478
like, we'll, just say it
right off the top there.

39:08.480 --> 39:11.014
There,
there's a lot of energy here.

39:11.016 --> 39:13.016
There's a lot of activity.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.251
There could have been
a thousand things
that wanted to talk to us,

39:15.253 --> 39:19.656
but it seemed like
everyone stepped aside
for this one thing to be like,

39:19.658 --> 39:21.257
"Okay, this is what
we're going to talk about."

39:21.259 --> 39:24.294
[Amy] We had
a lot of communication
in the basement.

39:24.296 --> 39:26.196
That was the hot spot
for us.

39:26.198 --> 39:30.133
Chip Coffey sent us a text
and he said,
"I have a message for you.

39:30.135 --> 39:31.634
The dead are in the basement."

39:32.838 --> 39:36.906
We got quite a bit of activity
down there.

39:36.908 --> 39:39.242
Okay, so, well,
I'm just gonna tell you...

39:39.244 --> 39:40.310
Oh, God.

39:40.312 --> 39:43.079
...it was
one of the clearest EVPs
we've gotten.

39:43.081 --> 39:46.616
And we said, "How did you
end up in the basement?"

39:46.618 --> 39:49.552
And a voice says,
"I was left down here."

39:50.655 --> 39:54.557
Because of all of that
activity surrounding that,

39:54.559 --> 39:57.093
because of Chip
pinging on the basement,

39:57.095 --> 40:00.730
we just wanted to make sure
there was not a body
in the basement.

40:00.732 --> 40:01.731
Right.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.267
So, that's why we brought in
a cadaver dog.

40:04.269 --> 40:07.337
All of a sudden, he gets
to one spot in the basement

40:07.339 --> 40:10.206
and starts like digging
and smelling and digging.

40:10.208 --> 40:11.941
And then the dog
just sat down.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.411
Oh, there was something.

40:14.413 --> 40:15.712
Not just something
human remains.

40:15.714 --> 40:17.113
You think he really did?

40:17.115 --> 40:20.650
Well, that's when we
brought in
the ground penetrating radar.

40:20.652 --> 40:23.920
And he said that in that spot,

40:23.922 --> 40:26.256
there is something
that could be a grave.

40:27.359 --> 40:29.025
-Really?
-Yes.

40:29.027 --> 40:31.561
-Ooh, goosebumps.
-Yes.

40:31.563 --> 40:36.366
And so now our next step
is what we have to do,

40:36.368 --> 40:39.602
which is the right thing
is we have
to alert the authorities.

40:43.141 --> 40:45.175
[woman speaking]

40:46.077 --> 40:47.444
After everything
that's happened here,

40:47.446 --> 40:50.947
we felt it was the right thing
to do to call the authorities.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.016
And so, the police
are actually here now.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.350
<i>  They are in the basement.</i>

40:54.352 --> 40:56.286
<i>  We cannot film any of it.</i>

40:56.288 --> 40:58.822
In their eyes,
while we suspect
this could be

40:58.824 --> 41:01.925
potentially the remains
of someone
from quite a while ago,

41:01.927 --> 41:03.059
they have to rule that out.

41:03.061 --> 41:04.427
No cameras, please.

41:04.429 --> 41:06.196
[Amy] Yeah, I know.
That's... they told us.

41:06.198 --> 41:09.098
No, we know.
No, absolutely.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.301
<i> [Adam] The detective</i>
<i>  may want to speak to Deb.</i>

41:11.303 --> 41:12.702
-Yeah, I heard him.
-[Amy] Yeah.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.404
I reached out to her,
and I can set you guys up

41:14.406 --> 41:16.172
with her phone number
and also--

41:16.174 --> 41:18.141
The detective,
the other guy with us.

41:19.144 --> 41:23.012
<i> Right now, they're treating it</i>
<i>  like a crime scene.</i>

41:23.014 --> 41:25.648
<i>  You know, Lorrie</i>
<i>  has such an attachment</i>
<i>  to this building.</i>

41:25.650 --> 41:27.684
<i>  She is a part</i>
<i>  of this building.</i>

41:27.686 --> 41:29.252
So, I think right now
she's aware

41:29.254 --> 41:30.854
of what's going on
in the basement.

41:30.856 --> 41:33.389
Obviously, we don't have
all of our answers

41:33.391 --> 41:34.724
for the basement just yet.

41:34.726 --> 41:37.427
<i>  We've handed that</i>
<i>  over to the police.</i>

41:37.429 --> 41:42.031
But right now,
we have to leave here
without firm answers.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.400
As far as who is buried
in the basement,

41:44.402 --> 41:46.135
if there's someone buried
in the basement,

41:46.137 --> 41:47.937
I'm hoping not.

41:47.939 --> 41:51.508
But I can say that the police
are taking this
very seriously.
