00:21.883 --> 00:25.036
Political tensions
between the Demril dwarves

00:25.059 --> 00:28.246
and a race of humans
known as the Capital

00:28.269 --> 00:30.099
are on the rise.

00:35.587 --> 00:38.636
Making a decision to set
the business dealings

00:38.659 --> 00:42.571
have allowed the Capital to
strip the Demril mountains bare.

00:48.117 --> 00:52.132
The mining industry, once
the cultural and economic

00:52.155 --> 00:54.088
bed rock of these proud people,

00:55.331 --> 00:57.264
is now a marred disgrace.

01:01.337 --> 01:04.385
Newfound rumors of
missing dwarves and

01:04.409 --> 01:07.768
the mysterious collapses
have brought tensions

01:07.791 --> 01:08.999
to a boiling point.

01:11.864 --> 01:16.869
None more so than
in mine 347-864.

02:00.499 --> 02:02.363
Anyone there?

03:11.708 --> 03:12.468
No.

03:13.641 --> 03:14.435
No.

03:54.855 --> 03:55.614
Help.

03:59.411 --> 04:00.412
Help!

04:06.763 --> 04:07.523
Harvish?

04:18.430 --> 04:19.466
Harvish?

05:20.423 --> 05:21.735
Hold the light.

05:24.841 --> 05:26.049
Use your legs.

06:37.638 --> 06:39.329
Just a few more paces.

06:56.623 --> 06:57.520
Turn it slowly.

07:01.869 --> 07:03.492
You should be feeling that.

07:07.979 --> 07:09.118
Take the boot off.

07:11.292 --> 07:13.640
Be sure you don't put
your fingers in the wound.

07:27.032 --> 07:28.206
What color is it?

07:29.621 --> 07:31.497
All sorts of colors.

07:31.520 --> 07:32.348
Blood?

07:33.245 --> 07:34.039
A little.

07:36.352 --> 07:39.366
Reminds me of my daughter's,
when she broke her foot.

07:39.389 --> 07:40.183
Although,

07:41.357 --> 07:43.635
she didn't have a bone
pushing out like that.

07:46.362 --> 07:47.501
Slip it back on.

08:19.947 --> 08:21.650
Who is this?

08:21.673 --> 08:24.066
Calcas, he just
started working nights.

08:24.089 --> 08:25.228
No he didn't.

08:26.057 --> 08:27.196
I would know.

08:28.369 --> 08:30.521
You raise any good, Odryd?

08:30.544 --> 08:31.591
I'd say so, yes.

08:31.614 --> 08:33.616
Then you come with me.

08:38.794 --> 08:39.587
Now.

08:59.884 --> 09:00.574
Try again.

09:10.826 --> 09:11.827
It's them.

09:12.793 --> 09:14.876
How deep are they?

09:14.899 --> 09:16.394
Hard to say.

09:16.417 --> 09:18.431
A hundred paces, maybe more.

09:18.454 --> 09:19.662
Let me try.
Wait, wait.

09:21.457 --> 09:22.320
There's a pattern.

09:26.531 --> 09:27.463
Harvish knows it.

09:28.498 --> 09:29.718
Do you?

09:29.741 --> 09:30.604
Never needed to.

09:32.779 --> 09:34.643
Quick, we need some cloth.

09:38.094 --> 09:38.854
Anything?

09:41.822 --> 09:42.651
Yeah, use this.

09:48.311 --> 09:49.842
Tap,

09:49.865 --> 09:52.499
tap,

09:52.522 --> 09:53.627
hard tap,

09:54.835 --> 09:56.193
tap,

09:56.216 --> 09:57.010
tap,

09:57.942 --> 09:58.701
hard tap.

10:02.809 --> 10:03.603
It stopped.

10:08.953 --> 10:11.173
Wait, there it is.

10:11.196 --> 10:12.865
Hard tap,

10:12.888 --> 10:14.211
tap,

10:14.234 --> 10:15.661
tap,

10:15.684 --> 10:16.719
hard tap.

10:32.804 --> 10:33.840
Water.

10:36.705 --> 10:37.498
Water.

10:38.327 --> 10:40.168
That's all that's here.

10:40.191 --> 10:41.054
It's repeated.

10:42.814 --> 10:44.057
We need to hurry.

10:45.575 --> 10:47.439
The east tunnel is a dead end.

10:48.509 --> 10:50.074
Doesn't matter.

10:50.097 --> 10:51.098
It's our camp.

10:52.721 --> 10:55.977
We rescue them,
we doom ourselves.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.392
If we move any stone,
it should be towards

10:57.415 --> 10:58.761
the west entrance.

10:59.728 --> 11:00.982
I don't have the time.

11:01.005 --> 11:01.914
Neither do we.

11:01.937 --> 11:02.938
We have no food.

11:12.119 --> 11:13.914
All the more reason.

12:42.692 --> 12:43.486
Good?

12:46.835 --> 12:47.870
Good.

13:21.870 --> 13:23.250
You're good with the machines.

13:25.218 --> 13:27.979
I served as an
apprentice in the Capital.

13:29.394 --> 13:31.155
I've never met a
dwarf from there.

13:32.742 --> 13:35.021
Only humans can
carry citizenship.

13:36.781 --> 13:39.899
But they need us

13:39.922 --> 13:42.384
To maintain their machines.

13:43.684 --> 13:44.754
And keep their books.

13:45.583 --> 13:47.217
Let's not tell Brenn.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.908
He doesn't take well to them.

13:48.931 --> 13:51.209
Or me.

13:55.248 --> 13:56.329
I don't mind where you're from.

13:56.352 --> 13:57.698
A dwarf is a dwarf.

13:59.735 --> 14:01.887
Besides, if it wasn't for
the Capital's expansion,

14:01.910 --> 14:03.612
I wouldn't have this job.

14:03.635 --> 14:06.846
I did their mechanizing.

14:07.950 --> 14:10.746
Why do you think there's only
a handful of us on nights?

14:12.127 --> 14:13.749
Soon they won't need any of us.

14:16.096 --> 14:18.892
Brenn sees this, to his credit.

14:20.307 --> 14:21.446
After all his passion,

14:23.069 --> 14:23.932
he lacks wisdom.

14:26.624 --> 14:31.629
Demril would be a better place
if dwarves weren't so honest.

14:40.983 --> 14:43.503
But that is between us.

14:44.953 --> 14:47.058
We'll need his help if
we're to make it out.

15:56.231 --> 15:58.750
Awfully far in for a human.

16:02.030 --> 16:03.410
It was probably checking...

16:06.758 --> 16:08.634
That's not why she's here.

16:08.657 --> 16:09.520
Can you hear us?

16:12.178 --> 16:14.157
Do you know where
you are, Drusso?

16:14.180 --> 16:16.366
They've done this before.

16:16.389 --> 16:18.023
There was a mine up
in East Wood that

16:18.046 --> 16:20.025
caved in after it went barren.

16:20.048 --> 16:20.980
Dozens killed.

16:22.843 --> 16:24.707
I don't think it's intentional.

16:27.745 --> 16:28.918
Of course it was.

16:30.161 --> 16:32.865
Drusso here was supposed
to be on the other side.

16:32.888 --> 16:34.556
They've been bringing
black powder in here

16:34.579 --> 16:38.215
night, after night, after night.

16:38.238 --> 16:39.032
Hook it.

16:40.344 --> 16:41.322
You can't chain her.

16:41.345 --> 16:42.081
They'll have out heads.

16:42.104 --> 16:43.174
Hook it!

16:52.459 --> 16:54.231
What were you doing in here?

16:54.254 --> 16:55.635
She can't hear you.

17:02.262 --> 17:03.620
What were you doing with
these in the East Tunnel?

17:03.643 --> 17:06.209
Brenn, she'll die.

17:09.476 --> 17:11.109
Why were you this far in?

17:11.133 --> 17:12.455
Put it back.

17:26.252 --> 17:29.197
Why were you in so far?

17:29.220 --> 17:30.049
Stop it!

17:31.464 --> 17:33.017
Stop it, Brenn.

17:33.983 --> 17:34.984
We need her.

17:35.951 --> 17:36.814
We need you.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.105
If you want to leave here,

17:40.128 --> 17:42.061
we need to work together.

17:46.306 --> 17:49.516
I ain't leaving
here without Harvish.

19:57.403 --> 20:00.302
Alright mouse, we
need doubles, so,

20:01.269 --> 20:02.166
give me some help.

20:08.759 --> 20:10.795
I told you, he was
my good luck charm.

20:13.281 --> 20:15.283
You'll need five
to beat me, Calcas.

20:18.286 --> 20:20.322
You can roll for
me, if you'd like.

20:21.427 --> 20:22.405
You sure?

20:22.428 --> 20:23.222
Yes.

20:25.810 --> 20:27.479
Alright, mouse.

20:27.502 --> 20:30.275
We don't want any of
your help on this,

20:30.298 --> 20:31.299
so just relax here.

20:35.579 --> 20:37.305
It's a three, Calcas.

20:38.444 --> 20:42.425
Odryd, how many
oil cells do we have?

20:42.448 --> 20:43.495
A few.

20:43.518 --> 20:44.312
Food?

20:45.347 --> 20:49.466
Maybe half a dozen
nights if we ration.

20:49.489 --> 20:50.835
Less if Drusso wakes.

20:52.596 --> 20:54.218
How many paces we get today?

20:55.219 --> 20:56.013
Not many.

20:57.014 --> 20:57.980
We need Brenn.

21:03.434 --> 21:04.470
After shocks?

21:05.333 --> 21:06.368
Or a rescue.

21:36.812 --> 21:38.504
Getting stronger.

22:12.952 --> 22:13.849
Louder?

22:16.542 --> 22:18.337
I hear them tapping.

22:20.615 --> 22:21.961
Dozens of them.

22:29.934 --> 22:31.557
Odryd.

22:34.905 --> 22:35.699
Odryd!

23:13.184 --> 23:15.601
You alright, Calc?

23:17.430 --> 23:18.189
Yes.

23:49.669 --> 23:52.534
I don't remember
this being here.

24:31.055 --> 24:31.849
Calc?

24:33.644 --> 24:36.060
I think you should see this.

24:44.344 --> 24:45.380
You know about this?

24:50.281 --> 24:51.075
Calc?

25:06.953 --> 25:09.554
Looks older than the
other generators.

25:09.577 --> 25:10.612
It is.

25:11.682 --> 25:13.063
It wasn't even on the map.

25:25.109 --> 25:27.192
Fetch the oil cells.

25:32.703 --> 25:34.533
There should be two.

26:51.368 --> 26:52.852
I found this near the circuit.

27:00.653 --> 27:03.771
I never knew a dwarf
could be so comfortable

27:03.794 --> 27:04.692
with their machines.

27:06.866 --> 27:09.639
I bet Drusso would
have the key you need.

27:09.662 --> 27:10.951
I don't murder.

27:10.974 --> 27:13.804
You tell that to our
brothers you left to rot.

27:15.081 --> 27:16.635
Flip it, Odryd.

27:23.814 --> 27:24.608
Flip it again.

27:31.442 --> 27:32.789
What do you want, Brenn?

27:35.826 --> 27:36.862
Odryd.

27:37.932 --> 27:39.554
No dwarf should drink alone.

27:42.522 --> 27:44.191
Hurts on an empty stomach.

27:44.214 --> 27:45.836
You ain't got an empty stomach.

27:47.079 --> 27:49.460
I saw you nippin'
at our provisions.

27:50.910 --> 27:52.371
Come on.

27:52.394 --> 27:54.166
Hold this for me.

27:54.189 --> 27:54.949
Steady.

27:57.054 --> 27:58.711
I don't 'cause
of my little ones.

28:00.540 --> 28:02.243
Boy twins,

28:02.266 --> 28:04.590
and two beautiful girls.

28:04.613 --> 28:06.961
There's nothing I hate
more than a proud parent.

28:08.031 --> 28:12.012
"Oh my little one can talk."

28:12.035 --> 28:13.185
Well my dimwitted
cousin can talk

28:13.208 --> 28:14.773
but you don't see me bragging...

28:14.796 --> 28:16.844
Odryd's trying to work.

28:16.867 --> 28:18.604
Stop bothering him.

28:18.627 --> 28:20.952
There's an old utility tunnel.

28:20.975 --> 28:23.299
It leads to the side
of the mountain.

28:23.322 --> 28:25.784
We can blow our way out.

28:28.085 --> 28:31.710
This mine won't
take another blast.

28:33.125 --> 28:35.794
A second explosion
would kill us all.

28:49.417 --> 28:52.627
She ain't gonna need a drink
'til she comes 'round.

29:35.325 --> 29:36.844
Brenn?

29:39.122 --> 29:41.722
Head lamp, Calcas.

29:41.745 --> 29:43.828
It won't turn on.

29:43.851 --> 29:45.622
Odryd.

29:46.405 --> 29:48.200
Summon the soft light!

29:50.823 --> 29:51.870
Watch it, Brenn.

29:52.998 --> 29:53.792
Got him.

29:55.483 --> 29:57.243
Ah, come back, coward!

29:58.762 --> 30:00.637
Where's the lantern?

30:00.660 --> 30:02.639
It's with Odryd.

30:02.662 --> 30:05.010
Odryd, where is it?

30:08.220 --> 30:09.152
He's out.

30:10.084 --> 30:11.994
It looks like the beast got him.

30:12.017 --> 30:12.983
Is he alive?

30:13.984 --> 30:14.997
Feels like it.

30:28.378 --> 30:30.380
My head feels like
a box of stones.

30:47.949 --> 30:50.020
Where are you going?

30:54.438 --> 30:56.061
That's all the oil we've got.

33:10.781 --> 33:12.197
Get the sacks!

33:58.139 --> 34:00.383
You weak-minded fool.

34:01.556 --> 34:03.777
That oil was vital
to our estate.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.710
Speak for yourself.

34:05.733 --> 34:07.574
I'm trying to save our skins.

34:07.597 --> 34:09.645
How are we to see in the dark?

34:09.668 --> 34:12.096
Go ask our brothers
you left to rot.

34:12.119 --> 34:14.132
They would have
us save ourselves.

34:14.155 --> 34:15.409
How would you know?

34:15.431 --> 34:17.123
You're not even one of us!

34:18.090 --> 34:19.931
You're gonna save us with this?

34:19.954 --> 34:22.025
This is what got us here!

34:24.993 --> 34:25.786
Brenn.

34:26.926 --> 34:28.077
No!

34:28.100 --> 34:29.320
No!

36:48.930 --> 36:51.243
I keep tremors from the outside.

36:52.900 --> 36:56.628
There's a chance we can
hold out for a rescue

36:58.319 --> 37:00.252
if we can just find some food.

37:01.460 --> 37:03.290
I bet that creature
would fry nicely.

37:04.394 --> 37:05.188
Yeah.

37:06.258 --> 37:07.811
Anything would at this point.

37:09.019 --> 37:10.584
I wish my wife was here.

37:10.607 --> 37:15.382
She can make Demril rats
taste like basted pheasants.

37:15.405 --> 37:17.177
Sage butter,

37:17.200 --> 37:18.097
red fennel,

37:19.271 --> 37:21.388
cold turnip collards.

37:21.411 --> 37:22.205
Odryd.

37:23.931 --> 37:24.966
Brenn.

37:25.933 --> 37:28.315
You're the strongest
miner in the company.

37:29.523 --> 37:31.571
And you know this mountain
better than anyone.

37:31.594 --> 37:35.529
There's no beast that Brenn
the Mighty can't slay.

37:36.771 --> 37:39.406
I don't know what
I'm dealing with.

37:39.429 --> 37:41.339
I've not had a good look at it.

37:41.362 --> 37:45.193
You told me you were a
mercenary up in the pines.

37:46.367 --> 37:48.484
You must've fought
much worse then.

37:48.507 --> 37:50.486
Not in these conditions.

37:50.509 --> 37:53.662
Not in the dark,

37:53.685 --> 37:55.894
which I'm sure this
beast can see in.

37:57.067 --> 37:59.794
If you are afraid, I understand.

38:03.971 --> 38:04.730
Odryd.

38:06.180 --> 38:07.457
I'm smarter than you.

38:08.355 --> 38:10.357
You don't manipulate me.

38:11.496 --> 38:12.842
I manipulate you.

38:17.536 --> 38:18.330
I know.

38:23.370 --> 38:25.648
But you're also smarter
than the creature.

38:46.427 --> 38:48.498
I think I struck it around here.

38:50.051 --> 38:51.329
Look for blood.

39:58.568 --> 40:00.432
Bookkeeper.

40:03.366 --> 40:05.299
I, too, like the light.

40:16.586 --> 40:17.622
Your leg.

40:19.313 --> 40:21.741
I got pinned in the collapse.

40:21.764 --> 40:22.765
Collapse?

40:23.662 --> 40:26.009
The mountain's belly folded.

40:27.286 --> 40:30.681
We're too deep in now
to dig ourselves out.

40:30.704 --> 40:32.752
I don't understand.

40:32.775 --> 40:36.399
My last memory is of fangs,

40:37.504 --> 40:38.965
and that dwarf chaining me.

40:43.820 --> 40:45.166
Fangs?

40:46.029 --> 40:47.801
The creature.

40:47.824 --> 40:49.067
We dug too deep.

40:54.693 --> 40:56.454
I feel like
we've been here before.

40:57.972 --> 41:00.630
Maybe it lives underwater,
or back at the hole?

41:02.149 --> 41:03.495
Then we're out of luck.

41:13.540 --> 41:14.472
You hear that?

42:33.412 --> 42:35.495
It might have a way out.

42:35.518 --> 42:36.807
We need to follow it.

42:36.830 --> 42:37.624
We?

42:40.109 --> 42:41.766
Why's it always gotta be me?

42:43.664 --> 42:45.643
I can't fit down there.

42:45.666 --> 42:46.736
Even starved.

42:48.738 --> 42:51.235
Issues with my shoulders.

42:51.258 --> 42:52.788
Too wide.

42:52.811 --> 42:54.410
I got my mother's.

42:54.433 --> 42:56.781
I'd be more worried
about your father's gut.

43:06.342 --> 43:08.137
Drusso is small for a human.

43:10.001 --> 43:10.795
She'd fit.

43:15.869 --> 43:18.814
Brenn.

43:18.837 --> 43:20.598
Just making sure
it's still down there

43:26.673 --> 43:27.674
Mine 347-864.

43:34.508 --> 43:36.303
347-864.

43:40.548 --> 43:41.826
This is Drusso.

43:43.690 --> 43:45.841
She's alive.

43:45.864 --> 43:48.326
There are others as well.

43:48.349 --> 43:50.466
It was generator one.

43:50.489 --> 43:52.503
The cause is not clear.

43:52.526 --> 43:53.872
Possible sabotage.

43:54.701 --> 43:56.818
It is expected unrest.

43:56.841 --> 43:59.671
You should have tended he
generators more closely.

44:00.568 --> 44:01.708
The fault is yours.

44:02.847 --> 44:04.676
I was attacked by a Sumobet.

44:05.539 --> 44:07.518
When I awoke, I was chained.

44:07.541 --> 44:09.209
Supplies are minimal.

44:09.232 --> 44:10.820
Three dwarves are alive.

44:11.890 --> 44:13.179
They're hostile.

44:13.202 --> 44:15.699
The west tunnel
will be quickest.

44:15.722 --> 44:17.839
The explosion exposed our minds

44:17.862 --> 44:20.876
to the Egous leaders
and now the dwarves

44:20.899 --> 44:23.879
are uprising along the pines.

44:23.902 --> 44:25.352
It is chaos.

44:27.078 --> 44:28.769
There will be no rescue.

44:30.909 --> 44:31.738
Does my uncle know?

44:32.842 --> 44:34.361
He is with the decision.

44:36.018 --> 44:37.260
Our hearts are with you.

44:38.917 --> 44:39.849
For the Capital.

44:43.370 --> 44:44.267
For the Capital.

44:59.731 --> 45:00.594
Take this.

45:02.769 --> 45:04.874
It should be enough
for the three of you.

45:14.504 --> 45:15.298
But...

45:17.231 --> 45:17.991
The tapping.

45:19.406 --> 45:20.729
Odryd hears a rescue...

45:20.752 --> 45:22.627
There is no rescue.

45:22.650 --> 45:25.343
It's an Egous mine on the
other side of the mountain.

45:30.072 --> 45:30.831
Drusso.

45:32.660 --> 45:35.111
Every light burns out
eventually, book keeper.

45:36.147 --> 45:38.321
Now let me die in peace.

45:57.616 --> 45:58.376
Nothing.

46:01.862 --> 46:03.968
You don't suppose she hurt Calc?

46:32.824 --> 46:33.652
Where is she?

46:36.759 --> 46:37.795
Where'd you take her?

46:41.729 --> 46:43.248
You're a fool, Calcas.

46:44.525 --> 46:45.388
We needed her.

46:47.874 --> 46:50.014
She's somewhere
in the west tunnels.

47:13.761 --> 47:14.912
No Drusso.

47:14.935 --> 47:16.776
We need your help.

47:16.799 --> 47:18.329
There's a tunnel.

47:19.353 --> 47:20.561
Grab her arms.

47:26.119 --> 47:26.913
Brenn.

48:26.489 --> 48:29.285
You had to do it, Odryd.

48:30.424 --> 48:32.116
Don't blame yourself.

48:35.705 --> 48:38.467
How long does it
take for things to spoil?

48:41.988 --> 48:43.506
Why do you ask that?

48:46.647 --> 48:47.545
The tremors.

48:49.478 --> 48:50.928
They're getting stronger.

48:56.657 --> 48:57.451
Odryd.

48:59.660 --> 49:01.007
We wouldn't tell anyone.

49:04.148 --> 49:07.151
You wouldn't have
just a little morsel

49:08.152 --> 49:10.948
if it meant getting
out of this mess?

49:13.812 --> 49:16.643
We just need a few bites
before the Capital comes.

49:18.196 --> 49:21.038
That's not the
Capital, you idiot.

49:21.061 --> 49:24.168
That's our brothers
coming for us.

49:25.169 --> 49:27.309
The Capital would
soon see us rot.

49:29.828 --> 49:33.349
Well whatever it is,
they just need to come.

49:35.006 --> 49:36.697
I have to make it out of here.

49:37.871 --> 49:40.184
You're not gonna eat Drusso.

49:44.395 --> 49:45.189
Eat the rat,

49:47.570 --> 49:48.986
if you can't last.

49:52.092 --> 49:54.853
The mouse has been with
me since I first started.

49:57.063 --> 49:59.042
It wouldn't make more
than a mouthful anyway.

49:59.065 --> 50:00.549
Not that I would.

50:13.079 --> 50:13.872
Odryd.

50:16.530 --> 50:17.290
Here.

50:18.912 --> 50:19.706
No.

50:26.092 --> 50:27.093
Thank you.

55:56.629 --> 55:58.355
You'll thank me later, Odryd.

56:17.788 --> 56:19.824
Mining can be tough on a dwarf.

56:22.448 --> 56:24.829
It's easy to get
lost in the darkness.

56:32.941 --> 56:34.713
You did the right thing.

56:34.736 --> 56:37.428
He wouldn't be able to live
with himself if we get out.

56:48.094 --> 56:48.853
You know,

56:50.337 --> 56:52.685
you're pretty old to
have just started mining.

56:56.654 --> 56:58.587
My primary trade is in numbers.

57:00.347 --> 57:03.696
After the acquisition,
the Capital kept me on.

57:06.492 --> 57:09.529
There's a heavy tariff
on metals leaving Demril.

57:11.497 --> 57:13.602
And they have an
elaborate export system.

57:14.983 --> 57:17.100
It funnels the wealth out.

57:17.123 --> 57:18.642
Only a fraction
of it stays here.

57:20.540 --> 57:23.198
Let's just say, it
isn't entirely lawful.

57:25.718 --> 57:28.962
When I tried to expose
'em, they found me out.

57:31.137 --> 57:31.965
I was sent away.

57:43.149 --> 57:46.048
I am responsible for
what happened here.

58:03.997 --> 58:08.001
You did your best
by your brothers,

58:10.176 --> 58:14.249
and I only wish others
could have done as much.

58:26.917 --> 58:29.724
I never thought it
would turn out this way.

58:29.747 --> 58:31.542
Life is full of bad luck.

58:33.682 --> 58:35.926
And the Capital
just makes it worse.

58:38.480 --> 58:40.758
You really think our
kin are coming for us?

58:43.209 --> 58:44.590
Well Odryd can hear them.

58:48.870 --> 58:52.057
And even the Capital
can't stop a throng

58:52.080 --> 58:53.633
of angry dwarves.

58:59.605 --> 59:01.641
I will go down in
the creature's tunnel.

59:11.720 --> 59:12.721
It's the least I can do.

59:49.758 --> 59:50.932
Odryd.

01:00:47.713 --> 01:00:48.506
Ready?

01:00:52.165 --> 01:00:52.925
Ready.

01:03:59.905 --> 01:04:00.595
Easy.

01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:02.781
Easy.

01:04:13.573 --> 01:04:15.058
I won't hurt you.

01:06:37.165 --> 01:06:38.201
Watch it.

01:06:44.241 --> 01:06:45.691
How'd you get past it?

01:06:47.762 --> 01:06:48.935
I just took them.

01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:52.698
I think she's only
interested in metal.

01:06:56.184 --> 01:06:57.220
Or machines.

01:07:00.085 --> 01:07:00.878
Not flesh.

01:07:02.225 --> 01:07:03.743
How many eggs are there?

01:07:04.917 --> 01:07:05.642
Dozens.

01:07:09.922 --> 01:07:10.716
But...

01:07:12.787 --> 01:07:13.546
No exit.

01:07:39.089 --> 01:07:41.275
Slow down, Odryd.

01:07:41.298 --> 01:07:42.989
The stomach's not used to it.

01:07:44.232 --> 01:07:45.268
Brenn.

01:07:47.097 --> 01:07:48.478
I'll take that liquor now.

01:07:54.518 --> 01:07:55.968
You've earned every drop.

01:07:58.315 --> 01:08:00.018
I thought you drank it all.

01:08:00.041 --> 01:08:01.226
Even your back up.

01:08:01.249 --> 01:08:02.354
That's my other back up.

01:08:07.531 --> 01:08:08.325
Mmm.

01:08:11.156 --> 01:08:13.307
That was surprisingly delicious.

01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:15.367
And you didn't even
leave any for your rat.

01:08:21.337 --> 01:08:22.201
There you go, mouse.

01:08:29.691 --> 01:08:30.484
Hey.

01:08:31.348 --> 01:08:33.292
What are you doin'?

01:08:33.316 --> 01:08:34.845
That's Calc's egg.

01:08:34.868 --> 01:08:35.973
No, no, no.

01:08:36.801 --> 01:08:38.286
You two, go on ahead.

01:08:40.081 --> 01:08:41.323
Why aren't you eatin'?

01:08:42.738 --> 01:08:43.889
I'm not hungry.

01:08:43.912 --> 01:08:46.363
You've gotten
thinner before my eyes.

01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:49.228
And you were thin before.

01:08:50.332 --> 01:08:51.127
Eat.

01:08:52.231 --> 01:08:53.474
It would be a waste.

01:08:55.890 --> 01:08:57.305
My leg is infected.

01:08:59.376 --> 01:09:00.343
It's spreading.

01:09:01.412 --> 01:09:02.977
You should have cleaned it.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.496
He wanted to keep
it in the boot.

01:09:04.519 --> 01:09:06.520
There's no use
troubling about it now.

01:09:08.212 --> 01:09:10.192
I'm not gonna make it.

01:09:10.215 --> 01:09:11.042
Calc.

01:09:12.872 --> 01:09:14.149
We can cut through rock.

01:09:15.496 --> 01:09:17.497
We can cut through bone.

01:09:18.499 --> 01:09:20.604
I can't ask that of you.

01:09:22.951 --> 01:09:25.161
You're the only one
who can get the eggs.

01:09:28.267 --> 01:09:30.787
I'll get another batch
before I'm too weak.

01:09:32.237 --> 01:09:35.412
It should be enough, if
you're right about the rescue.

01:09:37.345 --> 01:09:40.279
It's not just about you
getting the eggs for us.

01:09:42.247 --> 01:09:45.560
It's tricky, taking a limb.

01:09:48.563 --> 01:09:49.426
Eat the egg.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.221
Think about your family.

01:09:54.431 --> 01:09:56.088
You are family, Calc.

01:10:01.404 --> 01:10:02.646
We can't make you.

01:10:10.654 --> 01:10:11.448
All I know is,

01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:15.141
when we get out,

01:10:18.144 --> 01:10:20.285
I'll have the both of
you over to my home.

01:10:22.942 --> 01:10:24.668
I told you about
my wife's cookin'.

01:10:26.291 --> 01:10:28.085
And you two can meet the tykes.

01:10:30.398 --> 01:10:32.331
The would love to
climb on you, Brenn.

01:10:33.505 --> 01:10:36.301
Oh, I'm pretty good with kids.

01:10:37.509 --> 01:10:40.270
And my daughter
would adore you, Calc.

01:10:42.755 --> 01:10:45.586
I already can't help
her with her schoolin'.

01:10:46.932 --> 01:10:48.761
Always writin', she is.

01:10:52.662 --> 01:10:56.769
Maybe you could teach her
how to work with figures.

01:10:58.668 --> 01:11:02.361
And after dinner I'll
show you my shop.

01:11:05.502 --> 01:11:06.779
I wasn't gonna say anything,

01:11:08.333 --> 01:11:10.300
but I've got something
big in the works.

01:11:11.508 --> 01:11:13.234
I've been lookin' for partners.

01:11:14.339 --> 01:11:16.133
I think we'd work well together.

01:11:20.068 --> 01:11:20.862
Custom

01:11:21.829 --> 01:11:23.002
furnishings.

01:11:25.384 --> 01:11:27.329
Who's gonna make 'em?

01:11:27.352 --> 01:11:28.330
You will.

01:11:28.353 --> 01:11:29.434
I am?

01:11:29.457 --> 01:11:30.251
Sure.

01:11:31.666 --> 01:11:33.369
Didn't know I could whittle.

01:11:33.392 --> 01:11:34.370
Both stone and wood.

01:11:34.393 --> 01:11:37.304
I've seen your
skills with an ax.

01:11:37.327 --> 01:11:38.616
And Calcas.

01:11:38.639 --> 01:11:40.917
Those things you used to do.

01:11:42.574 --> 01:11:43.402
What do you call 'em?

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:50.685
Accrued liabilities,
coin appreciation,

01:11:51.479 --> 01:11:52.319
coin flow,

01:11:52.342 --> 01:11:53.078
audits.

01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:54.183
Yes.

01:11:54.206 --> 01:11:55.218
That stuff.

01:11:55.241 --> 01:11:58.670
You can do all that.

01:11:58.693 --> 01:12:02.018
And I'll do all the
sellin' and we'll divide it

01:12:02.041 --> 01:12:03.526
evenly between us all.

01:12:05.044 --> 01:12:05.838
What do you say?

01:12:10.498 --> 01:12:12.500
We don't really
have a business plan.

01:12:14.191 --> 01:12:15.538
Furnishings, Calc.

01:12:22.061 --> 01:12:22.855
It's a deal.

01:12:27.204 --> 01:12:27.964
Brenn?

01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:30.909
We can't sell furnishings
unless we have

01:12:30.932 --> 01:12:32.106
someone to build them.

01:12:34.557 --> 01:12:36.777
I just think it's
a lot of nonsense.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.594
Come on.

01:12:39.631 --> 01:12:40.459
Calc is on board.

01:12:46.292 --> 01:12:47.086
Well,

01:12:48.467 --> 01:12:52.989
we could throw some numbers
with a rat for luck.

01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:57.545
Get some funds, have a start.

01:12:59.409 --> 01:13:00.134
Could be good

01:13:01.791 --> 01:13:03.551
not having to deal
with the Capital.

01:13:05.829 --> 01:13:07.141
Be my own boss.

01:13:10.075 --> 01:13:12.399
Let's get Calc his egg.

01:13:12.422 --> 01:13:13.596
I'm not eating yet.

01:13:15.805 --> 01:13:17.646
But you just said.

01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:19.084
Do you really hear them?

01:13:20.465 --> 01:13:21.293
The rescue?

01:13:24.848 --> 01:13:26.367
A distinct double tap.

01:13:27.817 --> 01:13:29.508
It keeps getting
louder and louder.

01:13:34.271 --> 01:13:37.413
I'll eat if I make it through.

01:13:41.969 --> 01:13:42.935
Take it off.

01:13:53.498 --> 01:13:54.326
More.

01:14:36.195 --> 01:14:37.542
As low as you can.

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.343
Good thing I'm thin.

01:14:54.248 --> 01:14:57.182
Once it's done, pour some more.

01:14:58.735 --> 01:15:01.531
I'll singe, to cauterize.

01:15:06.778 --> 01:15:08.296
Work fast, Odryd.

01:15:15.787 --> 01:15:18.583
Hold my arm, so I know.

01:15:23.933 --> 01:15:24.968
Before we start,

01:15:27.592 --> 01:15:29.490
I have something
to tell you both.

01:15:30.733 --> 01:15:31.975
You have a right to know.

01:15:34.737 --> 01:15:37.981
It was I who caused
the collapse.

01:15:40.605 --> 01:15:44.885
I was trying to slow
the Capital's progress.

01:15:47.473 --> 01:15:50.649
I only meant to
sabotage the machinery.

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:55.274
I never intended to
imprison us, or our kin.

01:15:59.313 --> 01:16:00.072
I'm sorry.

01:16:50.364 --> 01:16:51.537
Get me my ax.

01:17:15.251 --> 01:17:16.045
Knife.

01:18:17.969 --> 01:18:20.557
Never took him for
a revolutionary.

01:19:26.037 --> 01:19:26.831
Calcas.

01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:31.813
Calc.

01:19:31.836 --> 01:19:33.182
It's about time you woke up.

01:19:37.842 --> 01:19:39.291
We've been worried about you.

01:19:40.983 --> 01:19:41.777
He was worried.

01:19:45.056 --> 01:19:47.829
I knew you wouldn't
let us wither away.

01:19:47.852 --> 01:19:48.991
How are you feelin'?

01:19:51.959 --> 01:19:52.753
Sore.

01:19:55.066 --> 01:19:55.860
Weak.

01:19:57.896 --> 01:19:59.415
And my neck is stiff.

01:20:02.694 --> 01:20:06.422
But I'm alright, I suppose.

01:20:07.975 --> 01:20:10.012
This will make you feel better.

01:20:31.999 --> 01:20:33.518
Tastes good, doesn't it?

01:20:36.728 --> 01:20:37.833
It's...

01:20:40.007 --> 01:20:40.836
It's unique.

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.116
Foot bothering you now?

01:20:46.876 --> 01:20:47.635
I mean...

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:52.778
Leg.

01:20:54.746 --> 01:20:55.540
Not so much.

01:20:56.713 --> 01:21:01.097
Just the stump throbs a little.

01:21:02.927 --> 01:21:06.275
It seems like you two did well.

01:21:07.241 --> 01:21:09.082
Brenn did the most.

01:21:09.105 --> 01:21:10.866
I was strugglin'.

01:21:12.626 --> 01:21:13.661
Thank you.

01:21:14.973 --> 01:21:17.665
But I got through
all the fleshy parts.

01:21:20.392 --> 01:21:21.152
Thank you.

01:21:22.601 --> 01:21:23.913
Good news Calc.

01:21:24.983 --> 01:21:26.398
It's getting louder.

01:21:27.572 --> 01:21:29.505
I can even feel 'em now.

01:21:40.481 --> 01:21:42.587
My hands aren't
what they used to be.

01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:46.568
We're going to make it.

01:21:46.591 --> 01:21:47.903
Just gotta hold on.

01:21:57.947 --> 01:21:58.948
Just in time.

01:22:01.675 --> 01:22:04.091
Couldn't let you
wake up in the dark.

01:22:06.542 --> 01:22:08.452
I appreciate that.

01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:20.832
You'll have to get
the eggs by memory now, Calc.

01:22:24.353 --> 01:22:26.113
I have a few matches left.

01:22:28.046 --> 01:22:29.737
That won't be enough.

01:22:33.983 --> 01:22:34.950
It's so dark.

01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:41.128
Could we light just one?

01:23:11.607 --> 01:23:16.382
I got two more.

01:23:16.405 --> 01:23:18.545
One thing is for certain.

01:23:20.236 --> 01:23:22.250
The Capital is not
getting another coin

01:23:22.273 --> 01:23:24.068
out of this mountain.

01:23:26.035 --> 01:23:27.174
I want for that.

01:23:49.196 --> 01:23:50.577
Give me the rat.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:52.234
He misses me.

01:24:01.243 --> 01:24:02.037
Wait.

01:24:03.279 --> 01:24:04.039
Listen.

01:24:07.214 --> 01:24:08.595
There is it again.

01:24:10.114 --> 01:24:10.942
Hear it?

01:24:15.636 --> 01:24:16.982
Yes.

01:24:20.676 --> 01:24:21.470
I think I might.

01:24:28.684 --> 01:24:30.145
I can't hear a thing.

01:24:30.168 --> 01:24:31.215
Shh.

01:24:31.238 --> 01:24:32.274
Just listen.

01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:34.690
And again.

01:24:38.314 --> 01:24:39.867
How about the last match?

01:24:41.145 --> 01:24:42.180
For the rescue?

01:24:43.305 --> 01:24:49.430
