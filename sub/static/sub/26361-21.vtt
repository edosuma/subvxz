18:37.246 --> 18:38.204
- I love her.

18:38.247 --> 18:39.379
I wouldn't do anything
to hurt her.

18:39.422 --> 18:40.902
- Well, I think we're
well past that.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.338
Don't you?
- Yeah, we are.

18:42.382 --> 18:45.472
So you need to tell us
whose party that was, okay?

18:45.515 --> 18:48.039
- A guy named Bob, I think.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.737
I met him in a bar, okay?

18:49.780 --> 18:52.174
He told me he was staying
at the Harper Hotel.

18:52.218 --> 18:55.656
He was from Cincinnati
or something.

18:55.699 --> 18:58.441
- What about the other guy?
- He was from LA.

18:58.485 --> 18:59.703
They were both here
on business.

18:59.747 --> 19:02.141
- Do you remember his name
being Alex Kay?

19:02.184 --> 19:04.404
- No.
Should I?

19:04.447 --> 19:07.842
You gotta remember, we're from
a tiny town in Italy, okay?

19:07.885 --> 19:11.062
We were just looking
for a little excitement.

19:11.106 --> 19:13.064
- Okay.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.590
- Emilia and I swore

19:16.633 --> 19:18.113
that we'd keep
this entire thing a secret.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.462
- Then why'd you send her
the video?

19:19.506 --> 19:20.768
- She wanted it.
I don't know why.

19:20.811 --> 19:23.118
If Richard ever found out,
he'd send her home.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.685
- Well, it sounds like
she would have been

19:24.728 --> 19:26.208
a hell of a lot safer
back there.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.428
- Yeah.

19:28.471 --> 19:31.561
- So I have a class.

19:31.605 --> 19:33.563
- Yeah, go ahead.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.437
- You see that crucifix
around her neck?

19:37.480 --> 19:38.960
I don't buy for one second
that she didn't know

19:39.003 --> 19:40.004
what she was doing was wrong.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.223
- How about the host parents?

19:41.267 --> 19:43.617
You think they had no idea
this was going on?

19:43.660 --> 19:45.358
- Let's go find out.

19:47.795 --> 19:50.537
- Hi.
Hi, come on in.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.582
Hi.

19:53.670 --> 19:55.368
- Wow, this is
a beautiful apartment.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.631
- Oh, thank you.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.633
Richard's a quant trader.

19:59.676 --> 20:01.983
He does very well.
- "Quant trader"?

20:02.026 --> 20:05.334
- It has to do with algorithms
for high-frequency trading.

20:05.378 --> 20:06.857
- Oh.

20:06.901 --> 20:09.295
- It's a combination of math,
finance, and computers.

20:09.338 --> 20:10.861
That's about all I know.

20:10.905 --> 20:13.299
He'll tell you all about it
if you're interested.

20:13.342 --> 20:16.171
Can I get you something?
I--I have some coffee brewing.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.695
- Sounds great. I'll help you.
- Oh, thank you.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.915
I still can't believe
we have all this.

20:20.958 --> 20:23.526
Richard and I met in
high school back in Rego Park.

20:23.570 --> 20:26.486
- Long way from Rego Park.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.227
- It is.

20:44.939 --> 20:47.550
- We couldn't have children
of our own.

20:47.594 --> 20:49.813
Or should I say I couldn't.

20:49.857 --> 20:50.858
- I'm sorry.

20:50.901 --> 20:53.556
- Oh, I've learned
to live with it.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.865
I think that we get as much
out of the exchange students

20:57.908 --> 20:59.301
as they get out of us.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.390
- You guys have been doing it
for a long time?

21:01.434 --> 21:03.566
- Mm, Emilia's our ninth.

21:03.610 --> 21:04.872
- That is some view.

21:04.915 --> 21:06.439
- Oh, thank you.

21:06.482 --> 21:08.658
Oh, but now when I look
out the window

21:08.702 --> 21:13.272
all I can think about is that
cabbie driving by with Emilia.

21:15.230 --> 21:18.277
There--there's nothing wrong
with the case, is there?

21:18.320 --> 21:21.236
- Not at all, we're just
wondering how Emilia's doing.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.717
- [sighs]
Are you sure you're cops?

21:23.760 --> 21:25.936
[laughs]

21:25.980 --> 21:27.721
- We know how hard it can be

21:27.764 --> 21:30.724
to readjust after...

21:30.767 --> 21:35.076
- She seems to be
doing okay, considering.

21:35.859 --> 21:37.252
- Okay.

21:37.296 --> 21:41.343
'Cause, you know,
we spoke to her and...

21:41.387 --> 21:44.520
seemed like she was
hiding something.

21:46.435 --> 21:49.003
- Mrs. Matthews.

21:54.791 --> 21:57.577
- I--I shouldn't.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.709
- Maybe we can help.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.755
- [stammering]
Uh, no.

22:01.798 --> 22:03.365
Nobody...

22:03.409 --> 22:05.454
- What?

22:11.330 --> 22:14.637
- They were sexually abused.

22:18.815 --> 22:20.904
Both of them.

22:20.948 --> 22:24.125
By their dad back in Italy.

22:24.168 --> 22:28.608
Please--please don't tell
Richard that I told you.

22:30.261 --> 22:34.048
I mean, what--what kind
of man does...

22:38.095 --> 22:39.836
- So there's no doors
on any of the bedrooms

22:39.880 --> 22:40.968
in that apartment.

22:41.011 --> 22:42.448
Emilia never had
a moment's privacy.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.188
- Doesn't make sense.
We know she was a victim.

22:44.232 --> 22:46.234
A victim would want
double locks on the door.

22:46.277 --> 22:47.540
- Right.

22:47.583 --> 22:48.932
- And the--the sister act
at the sex party?

22:48.976 --> 22:50.412
It--it's strange.

22:50.456 --> 22:51.892
- And it wouldn't be
the first time

22:51.935 --> 22:54.416
an abused teen
acted out sexually, but this?

22:54.460 --> 22:57.114
This doesn't add up.

23:02.119 --> 23:02.511
.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.470
- He's already in jail
in Italy.

23:04.513 --> 23:08.387
Lara testified against him.

23:08.430 --> 23:11.868
- I am so sorry for everything
that you've been through.

23:13.957 --> 23:16.003
Emilia, how old were you?

23:16.046 --> 23:17.265
- Four.

23:17.308 --> 23:18.571
Do I have to talk about this?

23:18.614 --> 23:20.834
- I--I really think
that it will help.

23:20.877 --> 23:22.618
- Help what?
I'm fine.

23:22.662 --> 23:25.360
I got over it.
- You're not fine, okay?

23:25.404 --> 23:27.928
You went to a sex party
with two men

23:27.971 --> 23:30.321
that we over twice your age.

23:30.365 --> 23:32.846
- You think I'm a slut.

23:32.889 --> 23:34.456
- Uh, n-not at all.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.328
That's far from the truth.

23:37.372 --> 23:38.460
Okay?

23:38.504 --> 23:39.896
I think that you are
punishing yourself.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.420
- For being a slut.

23:41.463 --> 23:45.032
- I think that you are
a young, innocent girl

23:45.075 --> 23:47.687
who had a bad thing happen
to her.

23:47.730 --> 23:51.342
- It happened because of me.

23:51.386 --> 23:52.866
- Emilia.

23:52.909 --> 23:55.129
Emilia, your father...

23:55.172 --> 23:57.871
is the criminal here.

23:57.914 --> 23:59.655
- [sighs]

23:59.699 --> 24:01.222
- Not you.

24:01.265 --> 24:04.399
This is not your fault.

24:04.443 --> 24:07.446
What did your father do to you?

24:08.751 --> 24:12.755
- It was always in the morning
when Lara was at school.

24:14.844 --> 24:18.369
Mama was in town at the market.

24:18.413 --> 24:21.024
She went every Tuesday.

24:22.722 --> 24:26.290
I could hear his flip-flops
snap against the wooden floor

24:26.334 --> 24:29.293
and I knew.

24:29.337 --> 24:32.079
He carried me into his bed.

24:32.122 --> 24:34.908
The same bed where he slept...

24:34.951 --> 24:36.910
every night with Mama.

24:36.953 --> 24:40.261
- I could smell the wine
on his breath

24:40.304 --> 24:42.742
from the night before.

24:42.785 --> 24:45.005
He crawled on top of me
and laughed.

24:45.048 --> 24:48.051
He grunted like a pig.

24:50.619 --> 24:52.316
- How old were you?

24:52.360 --> 24:54.797
- Four.

24:54.841 --> 24:57.974
Look, I already told the court
in Italy all about it.

24:58.018 --> 25:00.760
They locked him up.
- And what about your mom?

25:00.803 --> 25:04.503
- We couldn't prove
she knew about it, but...

25:04.546 --> 25:06.243
she's suffering anyway.

25:06.287 --> 25:07.549
- Mm.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.116
- Nobody in the town
will talk to her anymore.

25:09.159 --> 25:12.554
That's why I insisted that
Emilia come to America.

25:12.598 --> 25:15.035
Thank God Richard wanted
another student,

25:15.078 --> 25:17.472
- What about Mary?

25:17.516 --> 25:20.867
- Sure.
She loves us, too.

25:20.910 --> 25:22.608
But Richard?

25:22.651 --> 25:25.175
He helped me realize
what my father had done to me.

25:25.219 --> 25:27.787
I'll love him forever for that.

25:31.312 --> 25:33.183
- Was there a door
on your bedroom

25:33.227 --> 25:34.663
when you lived
at Richard and Mary's?

25:34.707 --> 25:36.491
- What?
Of course, why?

25:36.535 --> 25:40.190
- Because there's no doors
on any of the bedrooms now.

25:40.234 --> 25:42.105
- Oh, uh, well,

25:42.149 --> 25:44.064
that's probably their stupid
decorator bringing in doors

25:44.107 --> 25:47.850
from, uh, France,
or Germany, or something.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.678
- Okay.

25:49.722 --> 25:51.854
You wanna tell me about...

25:51.898 --> 25:53.726
any other parties
there might have been?

25:53.769 --> 25:55.510
- What other parties?

25:55.554 --> 25:57.338
- Like the one you had
at the Harper Hotel.

25:57.381 --> 25:59.645
- I told you,
that was only one time.

25:59.688 --> 26:04.301
- I flew here for Lara's
graduation from high school.

26:04.345 --> 26:07.217
Richard paid for it.

26:07.261 --> 26:09.785
- Did your mother come too?

26:11.570 --> 26:14.573
- Lara didn't want her here.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.923
She blames her.

26:16.966 --> 26:19.099
- Do you?

26:19.142 --> 26:20.535
- Now I do.

26:20.579 --> 26:24.539
She let it all happen.
She had to know.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.889
Anyway, I never went home
after that.

26:26.933 --> 26:30.197
- You didn't go home
for your father's trial?

26:30.240 --> 26:33.156
- Richard said I was too young.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.203
That it would be too painful.

26:36.246 --> 26:39.946
He went back with Lara
and then brought her back here.

26:41.382 --> 26:44.777
We are never going back
to Italy.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.737
- [sighs]

26:48.781 --> 26:50.347
- Hey, I'm gonna go
get a salad.

26:50.391 --> 26:51.610
You want something?
- No.

26:51.653 --> 26:54.830
No thanks.
Rollins, listen to this.

26:54.874 --> 26:57.485
It's the transcript
of the trial in Italy

26:57.528 --> 26:59.313
and Lara said...

26:59.356 --> 27:02.621
[speaking Italian]

27:04.100 --> 27:06.625
- English, por favore.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

27:06.668 --> 27:10.063
"I could hear
his flip-flops snap

27:10.106 --> 27:12.674
"against the wooden floor
and I knew.

27:12.718 --> 27:15.677
"He crawled on top of me
and laughed.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.461
He grunted like a pig."

27:17.505 --> 27:21.422
These are the exact same words
that Emilia used

27:21.465 --> 27:23.337
to describe
what happened to her.

27:23.380 --> 27:26.340
- Lara said the same thing
to me.

27:26.383 --> 27:28.864
Word for word.

27:30.039 --> 27:32.128
[folder slaps]

27:35.305 --> 27:36.785
- They both had to be coached.

27:36.829 --> 27:40.136
- Lara told me
that it was Richard...

27:40.180 --> 27:43.096
that helped her realize
that she was molested.

27:43.139 --> 27:45.272
He went to Italy
for the trial, too.

27:45.315 --> 27:47.927
- Oh, my God.

27:47.970 --> 27:50.669
- I got a list
of all the exchange students

27:50.712 --> 27:52.235
that stayed with
Richard and Mary.

27:52.279 --> 27:53.367
One of them is still here.

27:53.410 --> 27:56.457
She works as a translator
at the UN.

27:56.500 --> 27:59.242
- Talk to her and call me.

28:02.898 --> 28:06.032
- Richard Matthews?
How can I forget?

28:06.902 --> 28:08.512
- Why would you say that?

28:08.556 --> 28:09.905
- I was a kid, you know?

28:09.949 --> 28:12.603
16, fresh off the boat
from Ponta Pora.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.736
It's a small town in Brazil.

28:14.780 --> 28:17.521
I was with him two weeks
and it was great.

28:17.565 --> 28:20.002
At least I thought it was.
A party every night.

28:20.046 --> 28:22.396
- What kind of parties?
- Lots of booze.

28:22.439 --> 28:24.964
And then Richard told me
to come to the den with him

28:25.007 --> 28:26.313
to watch a film.

28:26.356 --> 28:27.706
He called it a film.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.795
It was homemade porn
starring Richard

28:29.838 --> 28:31.622
and the girl from my town
that stayed with them

28:31.666 --> 28:32.798
two years before.

28:32.841 --> 28:36.192
I got the hell out
of there that night.

28:36.236 --> 28:38.412
- Thank you for coming.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.022
You got here okay?

28:40.066 --> 28:41.415
- Yeah.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.417
This is really weird.

28:43.460 --> 28:44.810
- I know.
I know it is.

28:44.853 --> 28:46.812
Listen, I wanted
to talk to you privately

28:46.855 --> 28:48.770
and I figured
that you were sick

28:48.814 --> 28:50.903
of the squad room by now.

28:50.946 --> 28:52.861
- I've really got
nothing else to say.

28:52.905 --> 28:55.908
- Okay, well, why don't you
sit for a minute, all right?

28:55.951 --> 28:59.476
This will just take
a very short time, honey.

29:06.092 --> 29:10.574
So, Emilia, I need you
to tell me again...

29:10.618 --> 29:12.663
exactly...

29:12.707 --> 29:15.536
what your father did to you.

29:15.579 --> 29:17.756
- This is dumb.
- No, listen to me.

29:17.799 --> 29:20.236
Please, it is very important.

29:20.280 --> 29:21.803
I need you to trust me,

29:21.847 --> 29:24.763
and after this I promise you
I'm not gonna bother you again.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.983
Please.

29:31.334 --> 29:34.076
So you said...

29:34.120 --> 29:36.731
you said that it happened
in the morning

29:36.775 --> 29:39.778
when Lara was at school, right?

29:41.518 --> 29:43.694
- Mama was in town
at the market.

29:43.738 --> 29:45.566
She went every Tuesday.

29:45.609 --> 29:49.222
I could hear his flip-flops
snap against the wooden floor

29:49.265 --> 29:50.223
and I knew.

29:50.266 --> 29:53.269
- That's exactly...

29:53.313 --> 29:56.185
what your sister said.

29:56.229 --> 29:58.797
Word for word.

29:59.667 --> 30:02.104

30:03.627 --> 30:07.414
I think maybe you weren't...

30:07.457 --> 30:09.720
really molested
by your father.

30:09.764 --> 30:11.810
- Papa's in jail.

30:11.853 --> 30:15.857
- I know he is, and I think
that that is a mistake.

30:15.901 --> 30:18.425
- Why would I lie?
- You're not lying.

30:18.468 --> 30:21.776
I know that you believe that
that really happened, Emilia,

30:21.820 --> 30:25.867
but I think that
you were brainwashed.

30:25.911 --> 30:28.304
You and your sister--
- You're crazy.

30:28.348 --> 30:29.566
- Listen to me.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.307
Look at these photos, okay?

30:31.351 --> 30:34.006
Just...

30:34.833 --> 30:36.791
Emilia, do you remember that?

30:36.835 --> 30:38.184
- I don't want to look at him.

30:38.227 --> 30:41.622
- Do you remember riding
a bike with your father?

30:41.665 --> 30:44.146
How about this one?

30:51.980 --> 30:54.678
- That's my First Communion.

30:54.722 --> 30:58.987
It's when Mama gave me this.

30:59.031 --> 31:03.644
- I found these pictures
on your mother's Facebook page.

31:03.687 --> 31:06.038
Emilia...

31:06.081 --> 31:09.824
do you really remember...

31:09.868 --> 31:12.871
being molested by your father?

31:17.788 --> 31:20.095
I didn't think so.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.839
Emilia, who told you that?

31:24.883 --> 31:28.016
Who put that idea in your head?

31:28.060 --> 31:30.889
- Lara.
She said he did it to her, too.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.542
I didn't believe her.

31:32.586 --> 31:35.894
- Did Richard tell you that
as well?

31:35.937 --> 31:37.939
- I didn't believe him,
but he proved it.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.246
- He proved it?

31:40.289 --> 31:41.943
How?

31:41.987 --> 31:43.118
How could he prove it?

31:43.162 --> 31:44.250
- I don't want
to talk about it.

31:44.293 --> 31:46.513
- Emilia, this is
very important.

31:46.556 --> 31:49.298
How could he prove it?

31:49.342 --> 31:52.823
- With his fingers.

31:52.867 --> 31:53.999
- Oh, sweetheart.

31:54.042 --> 31:58.003
- He put them inside me
and he said...

31:58.917 --> 32:01.397
- [stammers]
What did he say?

32:01.441 --> 32:04.574
- He said he loved me.

32:04.618 --> 32:07.012
- Emilia,
that's not love, honey.

32:07.055 --> 32:09.840
He hurt you.
He brainwashed you.

32:09.884 --> 32:11.625
It's called grooming.

32:11.668 --> 32:13.409
- Why would he do that?

32:13.453 --> 32:16.238
- Because he wanted you
to do what he wanted.

32:18.197 --> 32:21.896
Did Richard have sex with you?

32:21.940 --> 32:25.465
- He said he loved me.

32:25.508 --> 32:28.381
- Did he take you to that party
with the older men?

32:28.424 --> 32:31.427
- He shot the video
on Lara's phone.

32:34.387 --> 32:36.519
Papa's in jail.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.422
He won't talk to anyone.
- Put some ice on that.

33:21.695 --> 33:24.045

on Third?

33:24.089 --> 33:25.568
That one.

33:25.612 --> 33:27.657
I used to own it.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.311
Sold it for six million.

Emilia and Lara?

33:43.151 --> 33:45.023
- All of them.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.459
They were all different.

33:46.502 --> 33:49.331
All beautiful in their own way.

33:49.375 --> 33:52.030
- They're kids.
- Yeah, they were.

33:52.073 --> 33:54.380
Young and innocent.
- And naive?

33:54.423 --> 33:56.686

33:56.730 --> 33:59.211
and indecent
this world could be.

33:59.254 --> 34:02.214
- So you showed them, huh?

34:03.215 --> 34:07.349
- What I did with my girls
wasn't dirty, detective.

34:07.393 --> 34:09.308
It was beautiful.

34:09.351 --> 34:10.918
- What about your wife?

34:10.961 --> 34:12.702
- She had her day.

34:12.746 --> 34:14.791
- You really are a prick,
you know that?

34:14.835 --> 34:16.793
- In your eyes.

34:16.837 --> 34:18.360
All my girls love me.

34:18.404 --> 34:20.232
- Even after
you tossed them aside,

34:20.275 --> 34:21.407
you moved on to the next one?

34:21.450 --> 34:23.104
- Or passed them around
to your buddies?

34:23.148 --> 34:26.281
- Let me ask you something,
Mr. Matthews.

34:26.325 --> 34:30.068
What age were you
when you were first abused?

34:30.111 --> 34:32.679
- Oh, my God.

34:39.555 --> 34:41.949
- Oh, come on.
What, is that really necessary?

34:41.992 --> 34:43.342
- No.

34:43.385 --> 34:44.691
- Richard Matthews,
you're under arrest.

34:44.734 --> 34:46.823
- No, no!
Please, just--just wait!

34:46.867 --> 34:48.216

- Come on--

Didn't you, Mary?

35:12.153 --> 35:13.285
- Don't say anything.

35:13.328 --> 35:15.374
- That's why Richard removed
the doors.

35:15.417 --> 35:17.637
So you could watch.
- He made me.

35:17.680 --> 35:18.986
