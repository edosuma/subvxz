WEBVTT

00:01.692 --> 00:03.676
I'm looking at a bribe,
plain as day.

00:03.701 --> 00:05.093
That's exactly
what it is.

00:05.094 --> 00:07.734
Tony Gianopolous got a hold
of that video somehow.

00:07.735 --> 00:09.203
I think he's trying
to take over the company.

00:09.287 --> 00:11.538
You son of a bitch,
you leaked it.

00:11.623 --> 00:13.323
Ava Hessington
is Hessington Oil.

00:13.374 --> 00:15.159
- Not for long.
- Excuse me?

00:15.210 --> 00:17.194
- This is my call.
- I'm afraid it isn't.

00:17.245 --> 00:19.546
You'd like her to remove
herself from management?

00:19.631 --> 00:21.799
I'm not going to stand
for losing this takeover.

00:21.866 --> 00:24.718
Then don't,
but Ava isn't going anywhere.

00:24.803 --> 00:27.037
I just got voted
out of my own company.

00:27.088 --> 00:29.139
I stand by my decision,
and I'd do it again.

00:29.207 --> 00:30.591
Don't tell me it doesn't
have to do with Darby.

00:30.675 --> 00:33.977
You're the one who gave him
the 51% in the first place.

00:34.045 --> 00:36.213
You can't stand
being number two.

00:39.150 --> 00:40.100
Please tell me
you're calling me

00:40.185 --> 00:41.485
because you've been kidnapped.

00:41.552 --> 00:42.886
I'm not the one
who disappeared.

00:42.937 --> 00:44.438
I told you I had a thing.

00:44.522 --> 00:46.824
At 1:00.
It's 1:45.

00:46.891 --> 00:48.492
And it's called
a lunch hour, Harvey.

00:48.559 --> 00:51.895
60 whole minutes,
which my teeth deserve.

00:51.946 --> 00:53.363
You fit the dentist in
at lunch?

00:53.414 --> 00:54.898
He can be
surprisingly quick,

00:54.949 --> 00:56.283
yet remarkably thorough.

00:56.367 --> 00:58.285
Donna, Judge Atkins
is ready to hear

00:58.369 --> 01:01.571
my motion for summary judgment,
which she won't do

01:01.623 --> 01:03.240
if there aren't
two copies of that motion

01:03.291 --> 01:05.092
in my hands
in ten minutes.

01:05.176 --> 01:06.460
All right,
here's what you're gonna do.

01:06.544 --> 01:08.345
Go to my computer
and press "print."

01:08.412 --> 01:09.930
Pick the motions up
off the printer,

01:10.014 --> 01:12.249
then walk over to the corner,
throw everything in the trash,

01:12.300 --> 01:13.467
because there's already
two copies

01:13.551 --> 01:15.302
on your desk
at this very moment.

01:15.386 --> 01:18.188
So the trash can's
in the corner then?

01:18.256 --> 01:20.590
Bye.

01:23.978 --> 01:25.979
You had "a thing"?

01:26.064 --> 01:27.764
Well...

01:27.815 --> 01:30.067
Two things.

01:30.118 --> 01:33.954
But who's counting?

01:34.038 --> 01:36.740
What did he want anyway?

01:36.791 --> 01:39.710
I thought we agreed
not to talk about work at lunch.

01:39.777 --> 01:42.996
Yeah, we did, but we also
agreed to have lunch at lunch.

01:44.249 --> 01:46.833
Yeah, you're right.

01:46.918 --> 01:50.620
It's just that, uh,
I've always made it my business

01:50.672 --> 01:52.890
knowing about things.

01:52.957 --> 01:55.425
And you're good
at your business.

01:55.476 --> 01:57.010
Mmm, business is good.

01:57.095 --> 02:00.013
Ooh,
some might say booming.

02:02.133 --> 02:03.433
Listen, we've only
got 15 minutes left,

02:03.484 --> 02:06.469
so I'll endeavor
to be surprisingly quick.

02:06.521 --> 02:09.856
As long as you continue
to be remarkably thorough.

02:14.195 --> 02:16.530
Your Honor, you said
you would dismiss this case

02:16.614 --> 02:18.115
if he couldn't
produce evidence

02:18.166 --> 02:20.317
beyond the bribery tape.
Well, he couldn't.

02:20.368 --> 02:22.085
We found five witnesses
that tied the man

02:22.153 --> 02:24.314
that Ava Hessington bribed
on that tape to the murders.

02:24.339 --> 02:26.340
And those witnesses
refused to come forward.

02:26.424 --> 02:27.541
If we can't confront them,

02:27.625 --> 02:28.658
then their statements
are inadmissible.

02:28.710 --> 02:29.826
Just because
they won't come forward

02:29.877 --> 02:31.211
doesn't mean
they don't exist.

02:31.296 --> 02:32.546
He's right, their statements
may be inadmissible,

02:32.630 --> 02:35.132
but I can't ignore the fact
that they were made.

02:35.183 --> 02:38.435
Well, in that case,
we move for an expedited trial.

02:38.502 --> 02:41.521
Ten seconds ago,
he was moving for a dismissal.

02:41.606 --> 02:43.523
And in the ten seconds since,

02:43.608 --> 02:45.842
public opinion of my client
has gone down even further.

02:45.893 --> 02:47.194
She's a murderer.
How much lower can it go?

02:47.278 --> 02:48.445
Well, you tell me.

02:48.512 --> 02:50.032
You leaked evidence
to Tony Gianopolous

02:50.114 --> 02:51.815
that lost her
her company.

02:51.866 --> 02:53.150
You might leak it
to anyone.

02:53.201 --> 02:54.701
Your Honor, we've been
down this road before.

02:54.786 --> 02:56.453
It's called
bullshit highway.

02:56.520 --> 02:59.206
All dragging this out does
is delay Ava Hessington

02:59.290 --> 03:01.041
the opportunity
to vindicate herself.

03:01.125 --> 03:04.494
It also conveniently gives me
less time to build my case.

03:04.545 --> 03:06.213
But the case you just argued
was solid enough to go to trial.

03:06.297 --> 03:08.048
You're letting your mini-me
make your arguments for you now?

03:08.132 --> 03:09.049
Are you letting
your moustache--

03:09.133 --> 03:10.300
Enough.

03:10.368 --> 03:12.369
The trial starts
a week from Monday.

03:12.420 --> 03:13.587
Get out.

03:13.671 --> 03:15.538
You still haven't told
Harvey about Stephen?

03:15.590 --> 03:17.758
I went to tell him,
but he was in a bad mood,

03:17.842 --> 03:19.393
and then somehow
I ended up telling him

03:19.477 --> 03:21.011
that I made some copies
for Stephen,

03:21.062 --> 03:22.929
and he got
really pissed.

03:23.014 --> 03:25.048
What's he gonna do
when he finds out about this?

03:25.099 --> 03:27.651
Whoa, but I thought you said
that you two had never--

03:27.718 --> 03:28.986
So?

03:29.053 --> 03:30.237
So I get why he doesn't want
to share you here.

03:30.321 --> 03:31.688
You're his everything here.

03:31.739 --> 03:33.073
But what you're doing
with Stephen isn't here,

03:33.157 --> 03:34.941
it's there.
Two completely different things.

03:35.026 --> 03:37.227
Then why did you tell me
I had to tell him?

03:37.278 --> 03:38.561
To let him know
that your there and his here

03:38.613 --> 03:40.747
can coexist
in the same place.

03:40.832 --> 03:42.416
I liked it better when
we talked about you and Mike.

03:42.500 --> 03:43.450
I'm sure you did.

03:43.534 --> 03:46.286
So are you two
going to keep--

03:46.371 --> 03:48.789
Yes, it is some
of the best damn...

03:48.873 --> 03:50.924
Yoga I've had
in a long time.

03:51.009 --> 03:52.259
Well, sooner or later,
he's gonna find out,

03:52.343 --> 03:54.378
because it is
all over your face.

03:54.429 --> 03:55.578
Oh, please,
you're a woman.

03:55.630 --> 03:57.798
Men are oblivious.

03:57.882 --> 04:00.183
There's something
different about you.

04:00.251 --> 04:01.551
What is it?

04:01.602 --> 04:04.137
Yes, please tell the man
what it is.

04:04.222 --> 04:05.272
Nothing, Louis.

04:05.356 --> 04:06.690
I'm just--
been doing some yoga.

04:06.757 --> 04:08.859
No, that's not it.

04:08.926 --> 04:10.227
You're practically glowing.

04:10.278 --> 04:12.095
Tell me your secret.

04:12.146 --> 04:14.531
Ii don't think
that it's your cup of tea.

04:14.598 --> 04:16.599
For that glow,
I'd tea.

04:16.651 --> 04:18.452
I'm gonna have to keep this
to myself, Louis.

04:18.536 --> 04:19.935
Okay, well, promise me
you'll keep doing

04:19.987 --> 04:21.654
whatever it is you're doing.
I think she can do that.

04:21.738 --> 04:23.490
No, I'm serious, Donna.
Morning, noon, and night.

04:23.574 --> 04:25.158
Five times a day
if necessary.

04:25.243 --> 04:26.209
I will do my best.

04:26.277 --> 04:28.278
Mm.

04:31.115 --> 04:34.801
- Well, we did our best.
- Our best?

04:34.886 --> 04:37.120
Wait a minute,
you never expected this case

04:37.171 --> 04:38.672
to get dismissed.

04:38.756 --> 04:40.173
Then why would I ask for it?

04:40.258 --> 04:42.642
Because she was more likely
to grant an expedited trial

04:42.727 --> 04:44.127
after saying no
to a dismissal.

04:44.178 --> 04:46.963
And now, Cameron's
got a shitty case to try

04:47.014 --> 04:50.233
with no evidence and less
than two weeks to get any more.

04:50.301 --> 04:52.235
Wait a second.

04:52.303 --> 04:54.488
What if they didn't just have
to scramble for new evidence?

04:54.572 --> 04:56.356
What if they had to scramble
for a whole new lawyer?

04:56.441 --> 04:58.241
Any lawyer who got
assigned this case

04:58.309 --> 05:00.577
with only two weeks to go
would drop the whole thing.

05:00.644 --> 05:02.112
Unless they had
a personal beef with you,

05:02.163 --> 05:03.646
which they wouldn't.
There's only one way

05:03.698 --> 05:05.248
to get Cameron
thrown off this case.

05:05.316 --> 05:06.867
Prove he colluded
with Gianopolous.

05:06.951 --> 05:10.587
Turn bullshit highway into...
fact highway.

05:10.654 --> 05:11.671
Fact highway?

05:11.756 --> 05:12.989
Yeah, you know,
it's right next

05:13.040 --> 05:15.542
to "I don't want to talk
about this anymore" lane.

05:15.626 --> 05:17.627
We're gonna have to talk
about how to prove they colluded

05:17.678 --> 05:20.163
because we have a chance
to get rid of this murder charge

05:20.214 --> 05:21.831

Trina said
you wanted to see me.

05:58.162 --> 06:00.122
Hey, Simon, come on in.
I have a question for you.

06:01.481 --> 06:02.815
Come on, you need
to see this.

06:02.899 --> 06:04.483
Look at this.
This is so funny.

06:04.568 --> 06:05.734
Is that
some sort of joke?

06:05.785 --> 06:07.036
Nominal
in the first paragraph,

06:07.103 --> 06:08.404
pagination
on the left-hand side,

06:08.455 --> 06:10.456
Times New Roman's
stupid little feet

06:10.540 --> 06:11.740
walking
all across the page.

06:11.791 --> 06:13.659
And what's that word?

06:13.743 --> 06:16.111
- "Shall"?
- Mm.

06:16.163 --> 06:19.381
At this firm, we instruct,
we advise, we order,

06:19.449 --> 06:21.884
we must,
but we do not "shall."

06:21.951 --> 06:23.586
- That's not really a--
- Why must we "must"?

06:23.637 --> 06:25.721
Because we thrust,
we don't parry.

06:25.788 --> 06:27.756
Rewrite this.

06:27.807 --> 06:30.092
I can't.

06:31.511 --> 06:32.628
Excuse me?

06:32.679 --> 06:33.929
Mr. Nesbitt has clearly
instructed us--

06:33.980 --> 06:36.315
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This was Nigel's doing?

06:36.399 --> 06:37.733
Per his most recent memo.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.768
He's communicating
with you through memos?

06:39.819 --> 06:41.820
You've been left adrift
on lady law's fickle ocean

06:41.905 --> 06:43.239
with no rudder,
no captain?

06:43.306 --> 06:44.973
He hasn't been
in the office

06:45.025 --> 06:46.358
since he took over
the program,

06:46.443 --> 06:47.564
if that's
what you're asking.

06:47.577 --> 06:48.494
No, I think
I was perfectly clear

06:48.578 --> 06:50.446
in what I was asking,
Simon.

06:50.497 --> 06:51.530
Am I supposed
to respond to that?

06:51.615 --> 06:52.781
Yeah, by going back

06:52.832 --> 06:53.699
to your desk right now
and doing it correctly.

06:53.783 --> 06:54.700
But--

06:54.784 --> 06:55.918
Simon,
a memo from Nigel

06:55.985 --> 06:57.002
is not gonna stick
its boot in your ass.

06:57.087 --> 07:00.005
A memo from me will.
Get out.

07:07.964 --> 07:10.099
I told you,
not at the office.

07:10.166 --> 07:12.000
You mean I can't see Harvey
at the office?

07:12.052 --> 07:13.168
'Cause that's what
I'm here to do.

07:13.220 --> 07:14.887
- Oh.
- Oh.

07:14.971 --> 07:15.938
- What?
- You know what.

07:16.005 --> 07:17.005
You haven't told him yet.

07:17.023 --> 07:18.357
It's none
of his business.

07:18.441 --> 07:21.560
He and I are here,
and you and I are...there.

07:21.645 --> 07:22.678
I wish we were there.

07:22.729 --> 07:24.063
I just told you,
not here.

07:24.147 --> 07:25.281
Donna, what's going on
out there?

07:25.348 --> 07:27.116
I think he means
out here.

07:27.183 --> 07:29.485
You have a walk-in.

07:31.655 --> 07:32.655
What are you doing here?

07:32.706 --> 07:34.189
What I've always
been doing here,

07:34.241 --> 07:36.041
representing
Edward Darby's wishes.

07:36.126 --> 07:37.710
I lost Ava her company.

07:37.794 --> 07:40.579
I assume my deal
with Edward is dead.

07:40.664 --> 07:42.965
Well, Edward doesn't
see it like that.

07:43.032 --> 07:44.166
You may have failed,

07:44.217 --> 07:46.335
but Jessica took a shot
at her own team.

07:46.386 --> 07:48.003
And the consequences of that
are what?

07:48.054 --> 07:49.505
Deal stays in place

07:49.556 --> 07:51.557
as long as you win
her murder trial.

07:51.641 --> 07:54.143
What if my plan is
to not even have a murder trial?

07:54.210 --> 07:55.877
Well, as long
as you don't accomplish that

07:55.929 --> 07:58.647
by having Ava plead guilty,

07:58.715 --> 08:00.349
you'll be
the next managing partner.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.884
Good, because I'm going
to accomplish it

08:02.936 --> 08:04.820
by getting Cameron Dennis
thrown off this case

08:04.887 --> 08:06.822
for colluding
with Tony Gianopolous.

08:06.889 --> 08:08.857
And how are you
going to accomplish that?

08:08.908 --> 08:10.909
By suing
Tony Gianopolous.

08:10.994 --> 08:11.944
For what?

08:12.028 --> 08:13.279
For this...
or this...

08:13.363 --> 08:16.782
And/or that.

08:18.000 --> 08:24.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:29.963 --> 08:31.046
- Yeah, that's good.
- Mm-hmm.

08:31.097 --> 08:32.748
- It is.
- Yeah.

08:32.799 --> 08:35.801
- But I can do better.
- No way.

08:35.885 --> 08:37.970
$5,000 says I can.

08:38.054 --> 08:41.190
$10,000 says you can't.

08:41.256 --> 08:42.890
Excellent.

08:42.942 --> 08:44.977
What's your idea?

08:45.061 --> 08:46.695
Well, it requires you
to take me with you

08:46.763 --> 08:48.731
to see Mr. Gianopolous.
Mike?

08:48.782 --> 08:51.400
- Yeah.
- You're off the case.

08:51.451 --> 08:52.985
What? You're gonna let him
get away with that?

08:53.069 --> 08:54.236
I have to.
I just took a bet.

08:54.287 --> 08:55.604
There's no going back
on a bet.

08:55.655 --> 08:57.239
Okay, what if I bet him
that my idea's better?

08:57.290 --> 08:58.240
Then can I come?

08:58.291 --> 09:01.443
You gonna pony up
$10,000?

09:01.494 --> 09:04.463
Best of luck, guys.
Hope it works out.

09:06.249 --> 09:07.333
So you're off the case?

09:07.417 --> 09:09.335
Yeah,
thanks to Stephen Huntley.

09:09.419 --> 09:12.087
Well, doesn't he have his hand
in a lot of cookie jars?

09:12.138 --> 09:14.723
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

09:14.791 --> 09:16.975
Wait a second,
"nothing" never means nothing.

09:17.060 --> 09:18.594
Sometimes
it means something.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.462
Ah, do you want me
to force it out of you?

09:20.513 --> 09:22.848
I may or may not need
plausible deniability.

09:22.932 --> 09:26.101
- Rachel.
- Donna slept with Stephen.

09:26.152 --> 09:28.187
Holy shit.

09:28.271 --> 09:29.905
You cannot let her know
that you know.

09:29.972 --> 09:31.156
- Does Harvey know?
- No, not yet.

09:31.241 --> 09:32.574
Don't you dare tell him.

09:32.642 --> 09:34.193
Yeah, like I'm gonna
touch that with a 10-foot pole.

09:34.277 --> 09:36.144
But he's gonna care
that she didn't tell him.

09:37.480 --> 09:41.650
So how are you gonna
get back on that case?

09:41.701 --> 09:43.985
Um, I got
a different case.

09:44.037 --> 09:45.287
Graham Stenton.

09:45.338 --> 09:47.089
The accountant
who embezzled

09:47.156 --> 09:49.792
$30 million from our client?
Yep.

09:49.843 --> 09:52.294
And our job is to get
the money back, quietly.

09:52.345 --> 09:53.629
Our job
as in Pearson Darby?

09:53.680 --> 09:55.330
Our job
as in you and me.

09:55.382 --> 09:57.349
I'm interviewing
his associate this afternoon,

09:57.434 --> 10:00.185
and I need your help.

10:00.270 --> 10:02.855
You want me to be the Mike
to your Harvey.

10:04.974 --> 10:07.142
I do want you to be
the Mike to my Harvey.

10:07.193 --> 10:08.310
Yeah, well,
it's not really a thing.

10:08.361 --> 10:09.778
It can be.

10:09.846 --> 10:11.280
- Huh.
- Huh.

10:11.347 --> 10:12.681
I get to ask
half the questions.

10:12.732 --> 10:15.234
Oh, Harvey doesn't let Mike
ask half the questions.

10:15.318 --> 10:16.568
Fine, 1/3.

10:16.653 --> 10:18.287
Harvey doesn't
negotiate with Mike.

10:18.354 --> 10:20.188
Mike doesn't have sex
with Harvey.

10:22.409 --> 10:24.693
1/3 of the questions
seems reasonable to me.

10:35.138 --> 10:38.424
Could you possibly keep
your thwacking to yourself?

10:38.508 --> 10:40.509
This is a private club.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.177
With a sister club
in London.

10:42.228 --> 10:44.546
Courtesy mudding
privileges.

10:44.597 --> 10:47.015
And, yes,
it's Turkish.

10:47.066 --> 10:49.101
Outside mud is a clear
violation of club policy.

10:49.185 --> 10:50.552
There are rules,
Nigel.

10:50.603 --> 10:52.387
Just as there are rules
forbidding interference

10:52.439 --> 10:53.772
with my associates.

10:53.857 --> 10:58.193
Yeah, well, you don't give
a rat's ass about them.

10:58.244 --> 10:59.661
How dare you?

10:59.729 --> 11:01.830
You know, let me tell you
something you may not know.

11:01.898 --> 11:04.500
Associates,
they're like grains of sand.

11:04.567 --> 11:06.118
They need pressure
and heat

11:06.202 --> 11:08.069
to shape them
into Chihuly glass.

11:08.121 --> 11:10.756
Memos from a distant land
don't shape shit into shit.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.207
Nonsense.

11:12.258 --> 11:14.910
I attended boarding school
from the tender age of four,

11:14.961 --> 11:16.578
during which time
I received weekly memos

11:16.629 --> 11:17.913
from my father.

11:17.964 --> 11:19.348
Yeah, and look
how you turned out.

11:19.415 --> 11:21.416
Graduating summa cum laude
from both Cambridge

11:21.468 --> 11:23.435
and Harvard
is quite the failure.

11:23.520 --> 11:26.939
Your parents' choice
to "homeschool," much better.

11:27.023 --> 11:28.256
Okay, that was only
till I was ten,

11:28.308 --> 11:30.091
and my mother's science fair
was legendary.

11:30.143 --> 11:33.278
You must be so proud of
your uncontested blue ribbons.

11:33.363 --> 11:35.781
Okay, you know what,

11:35.865 --> 11:37.699
I'm not gonna let you
shatter the glass

11:37.767 --> 11:39.234
that I spent years blowing.

11:39.285 --> 11:40.986
And I'm certainly not gonna
let the likes of you

11:41.070 --> 11:43.438
tell me who I can
and cannot blow.

11:47.577 --> 11:48.777
He's not gonna come.

11:48.828 --> 11:49.778
He will.

11:49.829 --> 11:51.463
You pushed his assistant?

11:51.548 --> 11:52.548
I charmed her.

11:52.615 --> 11:54.049
You didn't.

11:54.116 --> 11:56.585
He's right,
you didn't.

11:56.636 --> 11:59.505
She was irritated.

11:59.589 --> 12:01.122
But I was curious.

12:01.174 --> 12:02.474
Works for me.

12:02.559 --> 12:05.594
You know what they say
about curiosity.

12:08.798 --> 12:10.015
I get it.

12:10.099 --> 12:13.018
I come after Hessington Oil,
you come after me.

12:13.102 --> 12:14.686
Well, bring it on, boys.

12:14.771 --> 12:15.854
I got a team of lawyers

12:15.939 --> 12:17.523
just itching
to take your lunch money.

12:17.607 --> 12:19.888
Well, unfortunately, you're
not gonna be able to use them.

12:19.909 --> 12:21.309
He's not gonna
sue you here.

12:21.361 --> 12:23.245
He's gonna sue you
in London,

12:23.312 --> 12:25.030
where you have
countless holdings.

12:25.114 --> 12:27.332
Where the burden of proof
isn't on the plaintiff.

12:27.417 --> 12:28.867
It's on the defendant.

12:28.952 --> 12:30.836
So instead of us
having to prove you're guilty,

12:30.920 --> 12:32.704
you'll have to prove
you're innocent.

12:32.789 --> 12:34.256
Doesn't look
very innocent.

12:34.323 --> 12:35.490
So you guys think
I'm gonna run scared

12:35.542 --> 12:38.510
at the prospect of losing
a little money.

12:38.595 --> 12:41.713
I'm a corporate raider.

12:41.798 --> 12:45.968
This is a $50,000 bond.

12:46.019 --> 12:50.105
You see, I'm not in
this business for the money.

12:50.172 --> 12:52.441
Money's just
about keeping score.

12:52.508 --> 12:54.776
I'm in this business
to win.

12:54.844 --> 12:56.061
Well, here's the thing,
Tony.

12:56.145 --> 12:57.729
This trial's
gonna take a while.

12:57.814 --> 12:59.481
You'll be going
to hearing after hearing,

12:59.532 --> 13:01.400
deposition
after deposition.

13:01.484 --> 13:03.364
You won't be able
to enjoy your business at all.

13:03.403 --> 13:05.186
So even if you win,
you lose.

13:05.238 --> 13:06.572
Or?

13:06.656 --> 13:08.957
Well, I...
I could withdraw the suit.

13:09.025 --> 13:12.160
And all that'll cost you
is the truth,

13:12.211 --> 13:14.463
that you colluded
with Cameron Dennis.

13:14.530 --> 13:16.248
Ah, but I didn't
collude shit.

13:16.332 --> 13:17.716
Yes, you did,

13:17.800 --> 13:20.168
when you let him leak you
that video of Ava Hessington,

13:20.219 --> 13:24.506
then tried to use it
to take over Hessington Oil.

13:31.808 --> 13:33.253
All right,
so how do we celebrate?

13:33.278 --> 13:34.524
Celebrate what?

13:34.967 --> 13:36.334
Our first case
as a couple.

13:36.419 --> 13:37.669
We should go
to that French place you like,

13:37.753 --> 13:39.054
get a bottle of wine,

13:39.121 --> 13:40.622
a couple of things that
I don't know how to pronounce,

13:40.673 --> 13:42.591
and then go back
to my place and celebrate.

13:42.642 --> 13:44.059
That's what we're calling it
these days?

13:44.126 --> 13:46.228
Well, "victory sex"
seemed less romantic.

13:46.295 --> 13:47.395
- Well, I can't tonight.
- Why not?

13:47.463 --> 13:49.181
I have dinner
with my parents.

13:49.265 --> 13:50.982
Maybe I could
come with you.

13:51.067 --> 13:52.734
Um...Yeah, I--

13:52.801 --> 13:54.436
Unless you don't
want me there.

13:54.487 --> 13:56.488
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait a minute.

13:56.572 --> 13:58.156
You don't want me there.

13:58.241 --> 13:59.608
Of course I do.

13:59.659 --> 14:00.808
You don't look
like you do.

14:00.860 --> 14:02.027
Is it because I'm white?

14:02.111 --> 14:03.672
- That's not funny.
- Empirically it is.

14:03.746 --> 14:05.447
No, it's not, and you're
acting like it's nothing.

14:05.498 --> 14:07.415
Rachel, come on, look,
I know it's something,

14:07.483 --> 14:09.003
but you're acting
like it's everything.

14:09.085 --> 14:10.785
It is everything.

14:10.836 --> 14:12.087
Wait a second.

14:12.154 --> 14:15.207
Do you not want me to meet them
tonight or at all?

14:15.291 --> 14:17.709
I don't want them
to find out your secret.

14:17.793 --> 14:19.878
They're not
gonna find out.

14:19.962 --> 14:22.013
- How do you know that?
- Because no one finds out.

14:22.098 --> 14:25.050
You, Donna, Jessica,
you were all told.

14:25.134 --> 14:27.519
Besides, I met your dad.
He didn't figure it out.

14:27.603 --> 14:28.687
He met you as someone
that he wouldn't give

14:28.771 --> 14:30.188
a second thought to,
Mike.

14:30.273 --> 14:32.190
As my boyfriend,
he is going to put you

14:32.275 --> 14:33.441
under the microscope.

14:33.509 --> 14:35.227
- I can pass inspection.
- Well, what about me?

14:35.311 --> 14:37.178
Because you might be experienced
at lying to the world,

14:37.230 --> 14:38.697
but I'm not.

14:38.781 --> 14:41.149
And it's not the world,
it's my family.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.235
Okay, Rachel, you and I
have told each other

14:43.319 --> 14:44.869
that we love
each other, right?

14:44.954 --> 14:47.739
Did we mean that
or not?

14:47.823 --> 14:49.574
If we did,
then at some point,

14:49.659 --> 14:52.043
I am gonna have to meet
your parents.

14:52.128 --> 14:55.463
Interview's in 20 minutes.
We should go.

15:02.338 --> 15:03.421
Make yourself at home.

15:03.506 --> 15:06.841
I wanted to talk to you
in here.

15:06.892 --> 15:09.210
- Is this about your--
- No, no.

15:09.262 --> 15:12.147
You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

15:16.552 --> 15:18.153
How'd it go
with Gianopolous?

15:18.220 --> 15:20.054
Well,
he's not a pushover,

15:20.106 --> 15:21.723
but I think we have
a good plan.

15:21.774 --> 15:23.408
- So it went well?
- Yeah, it went well.

15:23.492 --> 15:24.693
And since when are you--

15:24.744 --> 15:27.779
I'm sleeping with Stephen.

15:27.863 --> 15:29.948
I can see that.

15:30.032 --> 15:31.232
You can see that?

15:31.284 --> 15:33.585
That's all you have
to say?

15:33.669 --> 15:35.370
Do you want me
to say more?

15:35.421 --> 15:37.255
It depends
on what you would say.

15:37.340 --> 15:39.791
I'd say, "when?"

15:39.875 --> 15:41.343
Three days ago.

15:41.410 --> 15:43.128
Why didn't
you tell me before?

15:43.212 --> 15:44.629
I was going to,
but you got so upset

15:44.714 --> 15:46.080
when you thought
I was working for him.

15:46.132 --> 15:48.049
Because you work for me.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.518
Well, I'm not working
for him.

15:50.586 --> 15:52.253
Good.

15:53.973 --> 15:55.590
So you're not upset.

15:55.641 --> 15:56.941
No.

15:57.026 --> 15:59.093
What you're doing with him
is personal.

15:59.145 --> 16:01.095
- And this isn't?
- Donna,

16:01.147 --> 16:03.264
I don't wanna make this a thing.
I don't either.

16:03.316 --> 16:05.200
I just want to make sure
that it doesn't become a thing.

16:05.267 --> 16:08.036
It won't as long as you
don't let that affect this.

16:08.103 --> 16:11.122
Okay.

16:11.207 --> 16:13.158
Miss Clark, do you know
Graham Stenton well?

16:13.242 --> 16:14.609
We've worked together
for a while.

16:14.660 --> 16:16.328
And you handle the books
for his accounts,

16:16.412 --> 16:17.412
is that right?

16:17.463 --> 16:18.797
Yes, that's right.

16:18.881 --> 16:20.632
We just need to know
when exactly you became aware

16:20.716 --> 16:24.386
that Mr. Stenton
was manipulating the numbers.

16:24.453 --> 16:27.839
I don't believe he was.

16:27.923 --> 16:29.624
Well,
the auditors disagree.

16:29.675 --> 16:31.726
Well, I disagree with them.
Graham's a good person.

16:31.794 --> 16:34.035
I'm sure Bernie Madoff's
friends all said the same thing.

16:34.063 --> 16:35.313
That isn't fair.

16:35.398 --> 16:36.514
And Graham
isn't the only person

16:36.599 --> 16:37.879
who had access
to those accounts.

16:37.933 --> 16:39.967
Mr. Oxnard, Mr. Dipetro,

16:40.019 --> 16:42.854
several individuals
from the controller's office.

16:42.938 --> 16:44.806
I just have
one question for you.

16:44.857 --> 16:47.742
How long have you
been sleeping with him?

16:47.810 --> 16:49.194
What?

16:49.278 --> 16:52.330
You smiled when you started
talking about him.

16:52.415 --> 16:54.165
You called him "Graham."

16:54.250 --> 16:56.785
You've referred to everyone else
as "mister" or "individual."

16:56.836 --> 16:59.153
And when my colleague asked
you about sleeping with him,

16:59.205 --> 17:02.123
you didn't seem offended,
you seemed caught.

17:02.174 --> 17:03.375
I had nothing
to do with this.

17:03.459 --> 17:04.925
That doesn't mean
you don't know anything.

17:04.992 --> 17:07.595
Look, Miss Clark, we're trying
to make this go away quietly,

17:07.663 --> 17:09.547
but if we can't, we're gonna
make it go away loudly,

17:09.632 --> 17:11.433
which means putting you
on the stand.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.501
Beth, you won't be able
to take the fifth

17:13.551 --> 17:15.670
because you won't be
testifying against yourself.

17:15.721 --> 17:17.222
And if you lie on the stand,
that's perjury.

17:17.306 --> 17:19.674
Look, if you really
want to protect him,

17:19.724 --> 17:22.343
just get him to give us
the money back now,

17:22.395 --> 17:25.563
while we can still
take care of this quietly.

17:28.349 --> 17:30.201
I can't.

17:30.286 --> 17:31.686
That's it,
I'm calling the D.A.

17:31.737 --> 17:33.238
I think we should give her
some time to think about it.

17:33.322 --> 17:36.241
- I don't think so.
- Mike, it's a hard decision.

17:38.878 --> 17:42.380
Fine.
She has until tomorrow.

17:53.509 --> 17:55.844
Oh, what's going on?
Nothing.

17:55.895 --> 17:58.263
Simon.

17:58.347 --> 18:01.399
Mr. Nesbitt
gave us all gifts.

18:01.484 --> 18:03.435
And they're funny?

18:03.519 --> 18:05.820
I think
they're meant to be.

18:05.888 --> 18:08.156
Well, you know,
he has trouble connecting,

18:08.223 --> 18:10.358
but he's making an effort.

18:10.409 --> 18:13.278
Maybe he took
my words to heart.

18:15.948 --> 18:18.082
What'd you say to him?

18:20.920 --> 18:24.706
Ah.
Turned out quite well.

18:24.757 --> 18:27.258
- You crossed a line.
- I did no such thing.

18:27.343 --> 18:29.043
You took a private feud,
and you made it public.

18:29.094 --> 18:31.296
After you tried
to undermine my authority.

18:31.380 --> 18:32.714
Because you don't know
what you're doing.

18:32.765 --> 18:34.432
I knew what I was doing
when I took them from you

18:34.517 --> 18:35.517
like biscuits
from a schoolboy.

18:35.584 --> 18:37.051
All right,
you son of a bitch.

18:37.102 --> 18:40.638
You better get yourself ready,
'cause I'm about to kick--

18:40.723 --> 18:43.107
I know it's generally
against regulations,

18:43.192 --> 18:44.692
but her nanny
fell ill, and--

18:44.760 --> 18:46.644
No, no, no, no.
Say no more.

18:46.729 --> 18:48.313
A father's love
knows no rule.

18:48.397 --> 18:49.531
I didn't know
you were a cat man.

18:49.598 --> 18:50.982
Do I have brains
in my head?

18:51.066 --> 18:52.226
Do I have a heart
in my chest?

18:52.267 --> 18:53.427
Who is
this stunning creature?

18:53.435 --> 18:55.203
Her moniker
is "Mikado."

18:55.270 --> 18:56.738
So does that mean
she enjoys--

18:56.789 --> 18:59.491
Yes, whenever we travel,
I make sure she has

18:59.575 --> 19:01.776
some Gilbert and Sullivan
playing in her sherpa.

19:01.827 --> 19:03.628
Uh, do be careful,
she doesn't normally like--

19:06.048 --> 19:07.715
My God.

19:07.783 --> 19:09.167
What?
Oh.

19:09.251 --> 19:10.618
Does she prefer
the left side?

19:10.669 --> 19:12.387
She doesn't normally
let anyone touch her except me.

19:12.454 --> 19:17.225
I happen to have a way with
those of the feline persuasion.

19:17.292 --> 19:18.960
Do you have any cream?

19:25.985 --> 19:29.237
You wanted to see me?

19:29.304 --> 19:31.773
Yes.
I had some free time.

19:31.824 --> 19:33.975
Oakwood Foods canceled
our 10:00 a.m. meeting,

19:34.026 --> 19:38.580
as did Omni Holdings at noon
and Dunbar Securities at 4:00.

19:38.647 --> 19:40.915
Sounds like you need
to work on your people skills.

19:40.983 --> 19:43.034
You need to work
on your people skills.

19:43.118 --> 19:45.987
Those meetings were canceled
because we just got fired.

19:46.038 --> 19:47.672
And why is that
my fault?

19:47.756 --> 19:49.824
They're not my clients.
I've never even met them.

19:49.875 --> 19:51.826
No, but evidently,

19:51.877 --> 19:54.161
you have met
their new owner,

19:54.213 --> 19:56.514
Tony Gianopolous,
who bought them

19:56.599 --> 19:58.600
for the sole purpose
of firing us.

19:58.667 --> 19:59.767
Good.

19:59.835 --> 20:01.519
I pissed him off.
That means it's working.

20:01.604 --> 20:03.671
Oh, you mean
that plan of yours

20:03.722 --> 20:05.043
you didn't think
to tell me about.

20:05.057 --> 20:06.697
Oh, I thought about it,
and then I thought

20:06.725 --> 20:08.726
you'd just go behind my back
and undo it.

20:08.811 --> 20:11.446
So you went behind my back
and went to Stephen Huntley.

20:11.513 --> 20:13.347
I told you,
I trust him.

20:13.399 --> 20:15.617
Well,
you're the one

20:15.684 --> 20:17.619
who likes to throw
Darby's name around.

20:17.686 --> 20:20.955
So why don't
you and Stephen call him

20:21.023 --> 20:23.791
and let him know that
you single-handedly lost us

20:23.859 --> 20:25.359
more business in a day

20:25.411 --> 20:27.078
than you've ever gotten
in a month.

20:27.162 --> 20:29.196
And feel free
to use my phone.

20:29.248 --> 20:30.748
Since you freed up
my afternoon,

20:30.833 --> 20:32.584
I'm taking
the rest of the day off.

20:33.969 --> 20:35.587
Did you see the look
on her face?

20:35.671 --> 20:38.873
Are you kidding?
We put that look on her face.

20:38.924 --> 20:41.092
- Ah.
- Good cop, bad cop.

20:41.176 --> 20:44.312
- Uh, Mike, Harvey.
- So I guess it is a thing.

20:44.379 --> 20:46.564
So we should have the money
back by this weekend,

20:46.649 --> 20:47.932
and then,
we can celebrate.

20:48.017 --> 20:50.602
I was thinking that we could
celebrate tonight...

20:50.686 --> 20:53.605
After dinner
with my parents.

20:53.689 --> 20:55.323
Do you want me to come?

20:55.390 --> 20:58.076
That look
on Beth's face,

20:58.160 --> 21:01.913
it didn't just say
that they slept together.

21:01.997 --> 21:03.114
She loves him.

21:03.198 --> 21:08.119
I told you I love you,
and I meant it.

21:08.203 --> 21:11.673
That's not something
I want to hide from my family.

21:15.594 --> 21:17.578
I actually made plans,
so I'm not gonna be able to--

21:17.630 --> 21:18.746
Bad joke?

21:18.797 --> 21:19.914
- No, terrible timing.
- Bad timing.

21:19.965 --> 21:21.916
Okay.
I guessed.

21:27.473 --> 21:29.691
I need your help
with Gianopolous.

21:29.758 --> 21:31.609
Relax,
if he's making another run

21:31.694 --> 21:33.478
at Hessington Oil,
that's not gonna happen.

21:33.562 --> 21:36.147
- Well, how can you know that?
- Because you just restructured,

21:36.231 --> 21:37.982
and he can't force
another takeover vote

21:38.067 --> 21:39.317
for at least six months.

21:39.401 --> 21:41.869
Then why is he driving
my stock into the ground?

21:41.937 --> 21:44.906
- What?
- He's been dumping it all day.

21:44.957 --> 21:47.458
I'll take care of it.

21:47.543 --> 21:50.111
What did you do?

21:50.162 --> 21:51.462
We picked a fight
with him.

21:51.547 --> 21:54.048
We've just finished
a fight with him

21:54.116 --> 21:56.217
that ended with me
losing control of my company,

21:56.284 --> 21:58.336
so why in God's name
would you pick another?

21:58.420 --> 22:01.122
To get you out of these
murder charges once and for all,

22:01.173 --> 22:02.507
and after I do,

22:02.591 --> 22:04.842
we'll figure out a way
to get you back in charge.

22:04.927 --> 22:06.594
You see that you do,

22:06.645 --> 22:09.564
because I would rather rot
in a cell

22:09.631 --> 22:12.299
than let that man
take over my company.

22:17.701 --> 22:19.985
So I tell her, it's not
my fault she might be early.

22:20.428 --> 22:21.933
Man, I'm in the middle
of closing arguments.

22:21.934 --> 22:24.414
And I tell him that if he's
not with me when she arrives,

22:24.415 --> 22:26.250
the next case he'll try
is his own murder.

22:26.317 --> 22:27.751
Then I walk in the room,

22:27.819 --> 22:29.319
and she sees that I was right
outside the door the whole time.

22:29.370 --> 22:30.320
I was not amused.

22:30.371 --> 22:31.672
You weren't amused?

22:31.756 --> 22:33.207
You actually didn't go
into labor for another week.

22:33.291 --> 22:34.708
I lost that case.

22:34.793 --> 22:36.343
Robert, you've had
enough potatoes.

22:36.427 --> 22:38.595
She's trying to make me eat
that foodie bullshit.

22:38.663 --> 22:40.047
Oh, I find that
hard to believe.

22:40.131 --> 22:41.215
Made me a smoothie
this morning,

22:41.299 --> 22:43.267
I got all excited.
It was green.

22:43.334 --> 22:44.301
That's what healthy
looks like.

22:44.352 --> 22:45.352
Thank you, Rachel.

22:45.436 --> 22:46.503
- You're not alone.
- What was that?

22:46.554 --> 22:47.938
I'm bonding
with your father here.

22:48.005 --> 22:49.339
- Speaking of which--
- Robert.

22:49.390 --> 22:51.391
What? You don't even know
what I'm gonna say.

22:51.476 --> 22:52.976
I know the next six things
you're gonna say,

22:53.027 --> 22:54.845
and you're not gonna say them,
because I told you,

22:54.896 --> 22:56.780
Rachel doesn't want you
grilling this poor young man.

22:56.848 --> 22:57.981
- What?
- Mom.

22:58.032 --> 22:59.366
You're not taking it easy
on me, are you?

22:59.450 --> 23:00.851
- A little.
- You told me to rein him in.

23:00.902 --> 23:02.142
I also told you
not to tell him.

23:02.153 --> 23:03.570
That's not how we do things
in this family.

23:03.655 --> 23:04.955
I'm not keeping things
from your father.

23:05.022 --> 23:06.657
You kept it from me
when you scratched the car.

23:06.708 --> 23:07.708
Robert,
eat your potatoes.

23:07.742 --> 23:09.376
What's so funny?

23:09.460 --> 23:11.044
She's not consistent
with the potatoes.

23:11.129 --> 23:12.529
She's not consistent
with anything.

23:12.580 --> 23:14.197
Okay, you're not getting
any potatoes.

23:14.249 --> 23:16.216
Now what's so funny?

23:16.301 --> 23:18.051
Uh, I see
where she gets it from.

23:18.136 --> 23:20.804
Gets what?

23:20.872 --> 23:22.256
You better shut up
and eat your potatoes.

23:22.340 --> 23:24.424
Mmhmm.

23:28.379 --> 23:31.849
She actually said
she'd prefer to rot in a cell?

23:31.900 --> 23:33.767
Well, you've gotta give her
credit for that.

23:33.852 --> 23:36.219
You do,
and she's right.

23:36.271 --> 23:38.238
It's not making any sense.

23:38.323 --> 23:41.108
If he's not making a run,
why is he dumping her shares?

23:41.192 --> 23:43.560
- He's reacting.
- He's overreacting.

23:43.611 --> 23:46.062
He may have money to burn,
but this isn't

23:46.114 --> 23:48.165
tens of thousands,
it's tens of millions.

23:48.232 --> 23:49.583
It's completely
out of proportion.

23:49.667 --> 23:52.169
- Not exactly.
- What are you talking about?

23:52.236 --> 23:55.622
I subpoenaed his daughter.

23:55.707 --> 23:57.374
You what?

23:57.425 --> 24:00.076
He fired our client,
so I struck back.

24:00.128 --> 24:02.512
And you didn't think
to run that by me?

24:02.580 --> 24:04.014
No, I didn't think
you'd say no.

24:04.081 --> 24:05.933
I'd say no
because I'm not an idiot.

24:06.017 --> 24:07.417
Idiot?

24:07.468 --> 24:08.802
We need this man
to help us.

24:08.887 --> 24:10.637
You just made him
a permanent enemy.

24:10.722 --> 24:12.556
Me?
We did this together.

24:12.607 --> 24:14.858
- Don't put this on me.
- You're putting it on me.

24:14.926 --> 24:16.226
Because you
goddamn did it!

24:16.277 --> 24:18.357
You were going to go after him
no matter what I said.

24:18.396 --> 24:19.363
I attacked his business.

24:19.430 --> 24:20.981
You went after his family.

24:21.065 --> 24:23.700
Don't tell me you've never
done the same thing,

24:23.768 --> 24:25.101
and what's the difference
between me doing it,

24:25.153 --> 24:27.454
other than
the fact that--

24:27.538 --> 24:29.990
ah.

24:30.074 --> 24:32.292
I see.

24:32.377 --> 24:35.295
This isn't about me getting
personal with Gianopolous.

24:35.380 --> 24:38.715
This is about me
getting personal with Donna.

24:40.952 --> 24:42.953
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't just say that.

24:43.004 --> 24:45.339
Is that
because she's listening?

24:45.423 --> 24:47.174
I don't give a shit
if she hears it or not.

24:47.258 --> 24:49.142
You crossed a line
with Gianopolous,

24:49.227 --> 24:51.812
and you just crossed
another one with me.

24:51.896 --> 24:54.398
You know, you've had it
in for me from the start.

24:54.465 --> 24:56.683
And you've only been
with Donna for three days,

24:56.768 --> 24:58.301
that should tell you
something.

24:58.353 --> 25:00.270
Let me spell it out
for you, okay?

25:00.321 --> 25:02.689
You don't work my case
without me,

25:02.774 --> 25:05.094
and since you seem to be having
trouble understanding that,

25:05.109 --> 25:06.276
you don't work my case
at all.

25:06.327 --> 25:09.279
Now get out of my office.

25:21.793 --> 25:24.661
- So, Michael--
- Mike.

25:24.712 --> 25:27.047
So now you're gonna tell me
what to call you?

25:27.131 --> 25:29.833
No, I-I--it's--
people usually call me--

25:29.884 --> 25:31.018
I'm just messing
with you.

25:33.504 --> 25:36.440
So where are you from?
I grew up in Brooklyn.

25:36.507 --> 25:38.892
Brothers, sisters?

25:38.977 --> 25:40.444
Only child.

25:40.511 --> 25:42.345
Parents still there?

25:42.397 --> 25:44.031
They both died
when I was a kid.

25:44.115 --> 25:47.517
Nah,
you're messing with me.

25:53.574 --> 25:56.493
I just asked an orphan
about his dead parents

25:56.544 --> 26:00.247
and made a joke about it,
didn't I?

26:00.331 --> 26:01.698
Does he like apple
or blueberry?

26:01.749 --> 26:03.216
Mom, shh, I'm trying to hear
what they're saying.

26:03.301 --> 26:06.053
Rachel, relax,
he can handle your father.

26:06.137 --> 26:07.587
How do you know?

26:07.672 --> 26:09.339
Because you wouldn't have
brought him here if he couldn't.

26:09.390 --> 26:13.176
Besides, what are you so afraid
they're gonna say?

26:13.227 --> 26:15.395
You're right.
Nothing.

26:15.480 --> 26:18.732
Honey, what is it?

26:22.653 --> 26:25.355
You don't have
to tell me.

26:25.406 --> 26:27.691
But just tell me this,

26:27.742 --> 26:30.610
do you love him?

26:32.663 --> 26:35.749
As long as he hasn't killed
someone, it'll all work out.

26:37.452 --> 26:41.505
Come on.

26:47.095 --> 26:49.212
I thought you were taking
the day off.

26:49.263 --> 26:51.014
That was the day,
this is the night,

26:51.082 --> 26:52.682
and my name is
still on the door.

26:52.750 --> 26:55.635
It is.

26:57.421 --> 26:59.723
- What do you want, Harvey?
- You were right.

26:59.774 --> 27:01.525
We've had a lot
of disagreements lately.

27:01.592 --> 27:02.926
Which one
are you referring to?

27:02.977 --> 27:05.479
I'm not entirely sure
Stephen Huntley's judgment

27:05.563 --> 27:06.930
is better than yours.

27:06.981 --> 27:09.316
He went behind my back.

27:09.400 --> 27:11.068
Going behind someone's back

27:11.119 --> 27:13.269
doesn't seem like something
you have a problem with.

27:13.321 --> 27:16.823
Maybe, but he hit Gianopolous
below the belt,

27:16.908 --> 27:18.408
and now we have
a problem.

27:18.459 --> 27:20.494
<i>We</i> have a problem?

27:20.578 --> 27:22.579
You said your name
was still on the door.

27:22.630 --> 27:25.549
I'm coming to you
for help.

27:29.087 --> 27:30.887
What's our problem?

27:30.955 --> 27:33.340
He's dumping
Hessington Oil shares

27:33.424 --> 27:36.292
just to drive her
into the ground.

27:43.467 --> 27:46.469
Well,
if we can come together,

27:46.521 --> 27:47.854
maybe they
can come together.

27:47.939 --> 27:50.157
- I'm listening.
- Tony Gianopolous

27:50.241 --> 27:54.778
wants to own
Hessington Oil.

27:54.829 --> 27:56.580
Ava wants to control it.

27:56.647 --> 27:59.533
She sells him her shares,

27:59.617 --> 28:01.084
he gives her
the voting rights.

28:01.152 --> 28:03.336
And he gives up
Cameron Dennis.

28:03.421 --> 28:07.040
They get what they want,
and so do we.

28:07.125 --> 28:08.658
You think
he'll still go for it?

28:08.709 --> 28:12.045
He'll know we're coming to him
because he won.

28:12.130 --> 28:14.047
He won't be the problem.

28:14.132 --> 28:15.549
Ava said she'd rather rot

28:15.633 --> 28:18.468
than see him
take over her company.

28:18.519 --> 28:20.387
I'll take care of Ava.

28:20.471 --> 28:24.024
Look, it seems like
you two get along,

28:24.108 --> 28:26.509
and I like you.

28:26.561 --> 28:29.563
So I'm gonna
ask you this straight.

28:29.647 --> 28:31.481
She's worked her ass off
to become a lawyer.

28:31.532 --> 28:32.849
I know.

28:32.900 --> 28:34.780
Well, I don't want anything
to stand in her way.

28:34.785 --> 28:36.019
I would never do that.

28:36.070 --> 28:38.788
So what happens
when she gets into Stanford?

28:42.293 --> 28:45.045
You didn't know
she applied there.

28:47.364 --> 28:50.200
Looks like you two
have something to talk about.

28:57.722 --> 28:59.122
You're awfully
quiet this morning.

28:59.193 --> 29:00.477
- Just tired.
- Still?

29:00.528 --> 29:02.165
I mean, you went home
right after dinner last night.

29:02.166 --> 29:04.334
Yeah,
trouble sleeping.

29:04.385 --> 29:07.203
Is something wrong?

29:07.255 --> 29:09.089
Hey, who the hell
do you think you are?

29:09.173 --> 29:10.807
Mr. Stenton, I guess
you got our message.

29:10.875 --> 29:13.310
Oh, I did,
and now I've got one for you.

29:13.377 --> 29:16.062
Beth and I got married
this morning.

29:16.147 --> 29:17.714
You married a woman
to protect yourself?

29:17.765 --> 29:19.266
I married her
because I love her.

29:19.350 --> 29:20.567
But you did it
to make any conversation

29:20.651 --> 29:22.235
that the two of you had
privileged.

29:22.320 --> 29:23.987
Says the lawyer
who threatened her.

29:24.054 --> 29:26.740
Well, now you take this
to trial, she won't testify.

29:26.824 --> 29:28.942
Well, it's too bad
spousal privilege

29:29.026 --> 29:30.577
doesn't apply
to bullshit marriages.

29:30.661 --> 29:32.279
Yeah, good luck
arguing that.

29:32.363 --> 29:34.604
We offered the two of you
a chance to give back the money

29:34.615 --> 29:36.366
and walk away, but
after we prove you did this--

29:36.417 --> 29:38.251
Oh, you can't prove
I did a thing.

29:38.336 --> 29:41.588
And now, you can't force her
to prove it for you either.

29:49.380 --> 29:51.414
You never returned my call
last night.

29:51.466 --> 29:52.933
Well, what could be different
about last night

29:53.017 --> 29:55.769
than the night before?
Hmm?

29:55.853 --> 29:57.771
Maybe the fact
that you went to Harvey

29:57.855 --> 29:59.973
and you threw me
in his face.

30:00.057 --> 30:03.092
Um, I was just telling it
how it was.

30:03.144 --> 30:04.945
He's already
got it in for us anyway.

30:05.029 --> 30:08.482
Well, that's my business
with him, not yours.

30:08.566 --> 30:11.201
You're right.
I'm sorry.

30:11.268 --> 30:14.654
I never wanted to make things
awkward for you and Harvey.

30:14.739 --> 30:19.042
You made things awkward
for you and me.

30:19.109 --> 30:21.127
- Donna--
- I like you, Stephen,

30:21.212 --> 30:23.013
and I have enjoyed
our short-term arrangement,

30:23.047 --> 30:24.831
but I don't enjoy
complications.

30:24.916 --> 30:28.385
I don't either,
but it seems we have one.

30:28.452 --> 30:32.722
Now, I'm affected by you
more than I thought,

30:32.790 --> 30:35.725
and I'm finding I'd like
to extend our term.

30:38.596 --> 30:42.632
I'll take your offer
under advisement.

30:51.692 --> 30:54.828
I am not selling my shares
to that man.

30:54.912 --> 30:56.580
I don't know you
that well, Ava,

30:56.647 --> 30:58.314
and I won't pretend
that I do,

30:58.366 --> 30:59.916
but we do have something
in common.

30:59.984 --> 31:01.084
What is that?

31:01.151 --> 31:02.953
I merged
with Edward Darby

31:03.004 --> 31:04.788
to save my firm
from being hijacked

31:04.839 --> 31:06.590
by my piece of shit
ex-partner.

31:06.657 --> 31:09.175
And what exactly
does that give us in common?

31:09.260 --> 31:11.878
I know what it's like
to prefer rotting in the ground

31:11.963 --> 31:15.549
than letting my enemy
take what's mine.

31:15.633 --> 31:17.350
I said,
"rotting in a cell."

31:17.435 --> 31:19.052
I wasn't
up on murder charges.

31:19.136 --> 31:20.503
And you'd rather
have died?

31:20.555 --> 31:22.939
I was speaking metaphorically,
as I'm sure you were.

31:23.007 --> 31:24.724
Was I?

31:24.809 --> 31:27.193
You won't be able
to run your company from a cell.

31:27.278 --> 31:29.178
My point is,

31:29.230 --> 31:31.314
I didn't want to merge,

31:31.365 --> 31:34.234
but I did what I had to do
to keep my company mine.

31:34.318 --> 31:37.186
And how is that
working out for you?

31:37.238 --> 31:39.372
It has
its ups and downs,

31:39.457 --> 31:41.858
but I wouldn't be
standing here in front of you

31:41.909 --> 31:43.293
if I hadn't done it.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.912
Not exactly
a ringing endorsement.

31:45.997 --> 31:48.331
Ava...

31:48.382 --> 31:51.534
Do this.
Get free of your murder charges.

31:51.586 --> 31:54.504
Nobody is saying we can't try

31:54.555 --> 31:58.475
to get you
out of this deal later.

31:58.542 --> 32:00.760
I don't care what it takes,
I'm not losing to that guy.

32:00.845 --> 32:02.596
We need to find a way
around spousal privilege.

32:02.680 --> 32:03.880
I don't see how we can.

32:03.931 --> 32:05.398
Stupid goddamn law.
Excuse me.

32:05.483 --> 32:07.734
It's not entirely stupid.

32:07.818 --> 32:09.436
Oh, what, so now,
you're on his side?

32:09.520 --> 32:11.220
No, privilege exists
for a reason.

32:11.272 --> 32:12.388
You don't want
to have to worry

32:12.440 --> 32:13.323
about what you trust
your partner with.

32:13.390 --> 32:14.407
That's assuming your partner

32:14.492 --> 32:15.575
even trusts you
in the first place.

32:15.660 --> 32:17.060
What is that even
supposed to mean?

32:17.111 --> 32:20.664
It means, when were you gonna
tell me you applied to Stanford?

32:29.957 --> 32:33.209
Okay, so that's why you've
barely said three words to me

32:33.260 --> 32:35.679
since last night.
My dad told you.

32:35.746 --> 32:38.027
No, no, he didn't tell me,
he asked me how I felt about it

32:38.049 --> 32:39.529
because he assumed I knew,
like I know

32:39.583 --> 32:41.551
about all the East Coast schools
that you applied to.

32:41.602 --> 32:42.686
- Mike--
- First you didn't want me

32:42.753 --> 32:44.220
to meet your parents,
and now this?

32:44.271 --> 32:45.755
Yeah, and I changed my mind
about you meeting my parents,

32:45.806 --> 32:48.274
which I'm now
beginning to regret.

32:48.359 --> 32:49.976
Oh, why, because I found out
you hid something from me?

32:50.061 --> 32:51.461
Like you never
hid anything from me.

32:51.529 --> 32:53.480
I hid something from you,
it kept us apart.

32:53.564 --> 32:56.099
What brought us together
was me telling you everything.

32:56.150 --> 32:59.319
- I was going to tell you.
- When?

32:59.403 --> 33:01.938
Before I went,
on Friday.

33:05.626 --> 33:07.127
You're going there?

33:07.211 --> 33:09.412
I got an interview.
I'm sorry.

33:09.463 --> 33:10.714
I just didn't know
how to tell you, mi--

33:10.781 --> 33:11.881
- I don't know, how about,
"hey, Mike,

33:11.949 --> 33:13.717
I might go to law school
3,000 miles away"?

33:13.784 --> 33:15.264
I don't even know
if I'm gonna get in,

33:15.285 --> 33:17.053
which is exactly why I didn't
want to have this conversation.

33:17.121 --> 33:18.672
No, you didn't want to have it
because you might go there

33:18.756 --> 33:22.342
and you're too afraid
to say it.

33:22.426 --> 33:26.596
Okay.
I might want to go there.

33:26.647 --> 33:28.898
I've said it.

33:41.445 --> 33:43.079
You may enter.

33:43.147 --> 33:46.149
I'm afraid I've got
a bit of a sticky wicket.

33:47.535 --> 33:48.952
That sounds uncomfortable.

33:49.003 --> 33:51.671
The Hong Kong office urgently
requires me for a few weeks.

33:51.756 --> 33:53.289
Normally,
I'd bring Mikado, but--

33:53.340 --> 33:54.708
Whoa, wait,
are you asking me to--

33:54.792 --> 33:56.543
I can't get her papers
in time.

33:56.627 --> 33:58.211
She'd be facing quarantine.

33:58.295 --> 33:59.328
She'd sooner die.

33:59.380 --> 34:01.497
You already
understand her so well.

34:01.549 --> 34:03.499
I do, yet a request
of this magnitude--

34:03.551 --> 34:07.103
No, you're probably right,
it's too much to ask.

34:07.171 --> 34:10.889
I'm sure there is
a suitable luxury feline hotel.

34:10.975 --> 34:13.443
Don't play games, okay?
We both know there isn't.

34:13.510 --> 34:17.447
- So you'll do it?
- N--yes, can I have her?

34:17.514 --> 34:18.864
Do you have a minute?

34:18.949 --> 34:20.400
I don't really feel like
talking about us right now.

34:20.484 --> 34:22.869
It's not about that.
Our discussion gave me an idea.

34:22.953 --> 34:25.021
Our discussion?

34:25.072 --> 34:27.190
Can we please not fight
about what to call our fight?

34:27.241 --> 34:28.458
What's the idea?

34:28.525 --> 34:30.043
We don't do good cop,
bad cop anymore.

34:30.127 --> 34:32.128
We do bad cop, bad cop.

34:32.196 --> 34:35.031
The way I'm feeling right now,
yeah, I can do bad cop.

34:37.885 --> 34:39.252
Since when
do you come out here?

34:39.335 --> 34:41.471
Since they added
Asiago cheese.

34:41.538 --> 34:44.507
Your reward of choice
for a job well done.

34:44.558 --> 34:45.891
You remember that story?

34:45.976 --> 34:48.094
First story you ever told me.
You think I'd forget?

34:48.179 --> 34:49.728
That wasn't
the point of the story.

34:49.813 --> 34:52.899
- I assume you got Ava to agree.
- Yes, I did.

34:52.983 --> 34:54.650
Should I be buying you
an Asiago bagel?

34:54.717 --> 34:56.902
Poppy seed.

34:56.987 --> 34:58.387
The "good news, bad news"
bagel.

34:58.439 --> 35:00.023
Gianopolous agreed
to the deal.

35:00.074 --> 35:01.224
He gave up
Cameron Dennis.

35:01.275 --> 35:02.575
What's the bad news?

35:02.660 --> 35:04.160
Cameron
protected himself.

35:04.228 --> 35:06.746
He never explicitly told
Gianopolous about the tape

35:06.831 --> 35:08.414
and never actually
showed him the tape.

35:08.499 --> 35:11.000
So what's
the good news?

35:11.068 --> 35:13.203
He never explicitly
said anything,

35:13.254 --> 35:18.258
but he left Gianopolous alone
in the room with that tape.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.415
Late night?

35:31.416 --> 35:33.534
No sleep at all.

35:33.618 --> 35:34.708
The ulcer?

35:34.709 --> 35:35.942
No, Nigel's cat.

35:35.994 --> 35:38.045
You slept at Nigel's?

35:38.112 --> 35:40.381
No, he's out of town.
I'm cat-sitting.

35:40.448 --> 35:42.549
Mikado won't drink her cream

35:42.617 --> 35:44.618
unless it's precisely
5.5 degrees celsius,

35:44.669 --> 35:46.749
she turned her nose up
at Bruno's origami collection,

35:46.755 --> 35:51.008
and she won't use her litter box
unless it's facing London.

35:51.092 --> 35:52.843
Hate that damn thing.

35:52.927 --> 35:54.561
You're loving every second
with her, aren't you?

35:54.629 --> 35:57.681
All 86,400 of them.

35:57.766 --> 36:01.568
By the way, you don't have
that glow today, Donna.

36:01.636 --> 36:03.070
You stop yoga?

36:03.137 --> 36:04.655
I took
a couple nights off.

36:04.739 --> 36:06.073
Is this
because of Harvey?

36:06.140 --> 36:07.474
'Cause I don't care
what he says, Donna,

36:07.525 --> 36:09.076
you can't let work
get in the way of that glow.

36:09.143 --> 36:12.363
You know what, Louis,
you're right.

36:12.447 --> 36:14.865
I'm gonna schedule
an extra long session tonight.

36:14.949 --> 36:17.818
Ooh, can I come?

36:25.093 --> 36:27.044
Harvey,
what are you doing here?

36:27.128 --> 36:28.879
I'm here to tell you
that you lost.

36:28.963 --> 36:30.881
I didn't lose.
I may not have much time,

36:30.965 --> 36:33.717
but I still got--
That tape?

36:33.802 --> 36:36.770
Not anymore,
unless you want to dispute

36:36.838 --> 36:38.672
Tony Gianopolous'
sworn statement

36:38.723 --> 36:41.675
that you left him alone
with it.

36:49.684 --> 36:51.702
I can fight this.

36:51.786 --> 36:52.907
Chain of custody
is something

36:52.987 --> 36:54.822
I know a little bit about,
thanks to you.

36:54.873 --> 36:56.240
That tape is gone,
and so are you.

36:56.324 --> 36:58.826
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Admit it, Cameron, I beat you.

36:58.877 --> 37:02.195
Save yourself the embarrassment,
and cancel this trial.

37:02.247 --> 37:04.214
If you think
I would ever do that,

37:04.299 --> 37:06.533
I taught you
even less than I thought.

37:06.584 --> 37:09.536
This case was 50/50.
All you did was make it 80/20.

37:09.587 --> 37:11.088
99 to 1.

37:11.172 --> 37:13.140
It could be a million to one
for all I care.

37:13.207 --> 37:16.593
We're in the ring, I'm still
standing, and this isn't done.

37:16.678 --> 37:20.147
Now get out of my face.
I got a trial to prepare for.

37:28.222 --> 37:30.073
- What do you want?
- This is a request

37:30.158 --> 37:31.825
for charges to be filed
against Graham Stenton

37:31.893 --> 37:33.393
for stealing $30 million.

37:33.445 --> 37:35.565
The penalty for which
is 15 years in a federal prison.

37:35.613 --> 37:36.730
If you had proof of that,
you wouldn't have

37:36.781 --> 37:38.081
come after me
in the first place.

37:38.166 --> 37:39.733
We have proof that you knew
something was wrong

37:39.784 --> 37:41.401
and you didn't notify
your employer.

37:41.453 --> 37:42.736
Which is why
this is a request for charges

37:42.787 --> 37:45.422
to be filed against you
as an accessory after the fact.

37:45.507 --> 37:48.258
The penalty for which is
five years in a federal prison.

37:48.343 --> 37:50.928
But you can avoid that
by testifying against him.

37:51.012 --> 37:54.181
Even if I was willing to,
I can't.

37:54.248 --> 37:56.099
We're married.
He'd stop me from testifying.

37:56.184 --> 37:58.185
In New York,
not in Connecticut.

37:58.252 --> 37:59.686
Which is where the charges
will be filed.

37:59.754 --> 38:02.189
You're asking me
to turn against the man I love.

38:02.256 --> 38:03.807
Then go to jail
and trust him.

38:03.892 --> 38:06.360
I'm guessing he's not gonna
be there when you get out.

38:06.427 --> 38:09.279
Beth,
even if he waits for you,

38:09.364 --> 38:12.232
he did this, and the fear
of him getting caught

38:12.283 --> 38:14.284
is going to cast a shadow
over every moment

38:14.369 --> 38:18.455
of the rest of your life
together.

38:18.540 --> 38:21.458
He may not be able to see that,
but I know you can.

38:29.918 --> 38:33.470
I'll get you
the money back.

38:38.760 --> 38:40.394
What are you doing?

38:40.461 --> 38:42.179
Just leaving a note.

38:42.263 --> 38:45.966
By the way,
congratulations.

38:46.017 --> 38:47.401
I hear you got the tape
thrown out

38:47.468 --> 38:49.853
and Ava reinstated
as the CEO.

38:49.938 --> 38:52.239
- In spite of you.
- Yeah, I know.

38:52.306 --> 38:55.325
You went to Jessica
for help.

38:55.410 --> 38:57.528
- You have a problem with that?
- No.

38:57.612 --> 39:00.981
I just think it's ironic
that she doesn't realize

39:01.032 --> 39:04.317
she just helped me
dig her own grave.

39:09.457 --> 39:12.376
It's me.

39:17.599 --> 39:19.683
Money got wired
into the account.

39:19.767 --> 39:22.002
Congratulations.

39:22.053 --> 39:23.470
I don't think
she would've caved

39:23.521 --> 39:26.356
if you hadn't broken script
and gone all good cop on me.

39:29.644 --> 39:30.978
Look, I'm sorry--
I'm sorry-

39:31.029 --> 39:32.980
Rachel--
No, Mike.

39:33.031 --> 39:34.982
We're in a fight
because I made the mistake

39:35.033 --> 39:38.184
of not telling you that I was
considering going to Stanford,

39:38.236 --> 39:39.352
but we're really
in a fight

39:39.404 --> 39:41.855
because I'm considering
going to Stanford.

39:41.906 --> 39:45.792
What you said to Beth,
was that really about me?

39:45.860 --> 39:47.221
- Mike, come on.
- Because you said

39:47.245 --> 39:49.880
the fear of him getting caught
was gonna cast a shadow

39:49.964 --> 39:52.049
over every minute of the rest
of their life together.

39:52.133 --> 39:55.419
If you're asking
if it's occurred to me

39:55.503 --> 40:01.174
that going to Stanford
could be a fresh start...

40:01.225 --> 40:02.175
Yeah.

40:02.226 --> 40:04.144
It has,
but the truth is

40:04.211 --> 40:06.546
I may or may not
get into Yale or Columbia,

40:06.598 --> 40:08.599
and you were the one
that told me

40:08.683 --> 40:11.401
that it'd be stupid
if I didn't just cover my bases,

40:11.486 --> 40:15.322
so I just need to go
and see if I even get in or not.

40:15.389 --> 40:17.524
I get it.

40:17.575 --> 40:18.525
I get all of it.

40:18.576 --> 40:19.616
I just can't stop thinking

40:19.661 --> 40:22.279
about what will happen
if you do.

40:25.733 --> 40:27.000
You came to the decision

40:27.068 --> 40:29.953
to let me in on your secret
on your own,

40:30.038 --> 40:33.874
and I just need you
to give me the freedom

40:33.925 --> 40:36.960
to come to this decision
on my own.

40:39.597 --> 40:42.749
I'm not one
for sentimental gestures,

40:42.800 --> 40:44.801
but I was thinking
about when Hardman came back

40:44.886 --> 40:48.254
and you and I got into it.

40:48.306 --> 40:50.273
You got me
my tea set back.

40:50.358 --> 40:52.592
You here to thank me
for that?

40:52.644 --> 40:55.762
I'm here with a gesture
of my own.

41:02.120 --> 41:04.037
This isn't a tea set.

41:04.105 --> 41:07.624
It's going up on the wall
tomorrow.

41:07.709 --> 41:09.326
I asked for that
a while ago.

41:09.410 --> 41:10.794
You said I wasn't ready.

41:10.878 --> 41:12.829
I also said
I wasn't just going to slap

41:12.914 --> 41:16.717
someone else's name up there
next to mine, but I did.

41:16.784 --> 41:21.088
And now you regret it.

41:21.139 --> 41:23.757
And you're playing chess
again.

41:23.808 --> 41:25.425
What does that mean?

41:25.476 --> 41:28.011
It means, I want to know
if this is a gesture

41:28.096 --> 41:31.181
or if it's a move.

41:31.265 --> 41:35.902
What it is,
is my way of showing you

41:35.970 --> 41:39.305
that Darby's treating me
the same way I treated you,

41:39.357 --> 41:42.526
and I understand
how you felt.

41:42.610 --> 41:45.362
You don't like it,

41:45.446 --> 41:50.117
and this is your way
of getting me on your side.

41:50.168 --> 41:53.336
Harvey, I can't make you
believe me,

41:53.421 --> 41:55.956
but I don't want you
on my side.

41:56.007 --> 41:58.959
I want us to be
on the same side.
