00:00.281 --> 00:03.718
Sir, Astronaut Dolphin Detective
is doing space drugs!

00:03.797 --> 00:05.796
Lock that damn dolphin up!

00:05.873 --> 00:08.391
But, sir, he built
a giant space bong

00:08.468 --> 00:10.369
and is now
smoking our office!

00:10.446 --> 00:11.962
Whoa!

00:12.039 --> 00:13.397
Whoa!

00:13.474 --> 00:17.039
Despicable!
Drug use on cartoons? Ugh!

00:17.108 --> 00:18.766
What are drugs, Dad?

00:18.900 --> 00:20.484
Drugs are bad, Tommy.

00:20.569 --> 00:22.235
Hmm, whatever happened to good,

00:22.304 --> 00:25.124
old-fashioned,
wholesome cartoons?

Now, the Earth
is round and flat.

Both theories are equally valid.

00:55.886 --> 00:58.979
Kids, listen up!
I have a special guest here

00:59.048 --> 01:03.475

01:03.544 --> 01:05.328

Get to the part where you
tell them why drugs are bad.

01:28.660 --> 01:31.052
Oh, sorry. I'm still
working on the lyrics.

01:31.426 --> 01:32.976
- Drugs aren't bad.
- Yeah!

01:33.053 --> 01:35.954
Haven't you see the cartoon
"Astronaut Dolphin Detective"?

01:36.111 --> 01:38.330
- He makes drugs look fun!
- Yeah!

01:38.399 --> 01:39.858
Like the episode
where he did drugs

01:39.935 --> 01:41.751
and had sex
with moon elves.

01:41.828 --> 01:43.962
Or when he did drugs
and beat the Martians

01:44.039 --> 01:45.330
to death with a pipe.

01:45.407 --> 01:48.578
Or when he fingers
the Tyrannosaurus parrot...

01:48.653 --> 01:50.369
and then did drugs!

01:50.672 --> 01:52.594
- I want to do drugs.
- I want to do drugs, too.

01:52.663 --> 01:55.383
Kids, just because
you see something on TV

01:55.452 --> 01:56.818
doesn't mean
you should do it.

01:56.887 --> 01:59.673
Yeah! My dad says drugs
are bad, too.

01:59.742 --> 02:00.453
Huh?

02:00.522 --> 02:03.305
Why can't they make a cartoon
that <i> isn't</i> about drugs?

02:03.374 --> 02:05.461
Yeah? Like what?

02:05.631 --> 02:09.716
Um, like a cartoon
about a pineapple

02:09.910 --> 02:11.977
that wears a funny hat!

02:13.656 --> 02:14.930
Say that again.

02:14.999 --> 02:18.050
That was
the dumbest idea ever.

02:18.156 --> 02:20.482
Okay. How about a cartoon

02:20.559 --> 02:21.983
<i>about a pineapple</i>

02:22.052 --> 02:23.953
<i>that wears a funny hat!</i>

02:25.429 --> 02:28.562
The kids, they love
his idea so, so do I.

02:28.691 --> 02:30.149
- Jeffrey.
- Yeah?

02:30.312 --> 02:32.888
- Stop. Stand. Sit. Fetch him.
- Okay!

02:35.448 --> 02:37.507
Uh... you wanted
to see me?

02:37.584 --> 02:40.418
Your show, "Astronaut Dolphin
Detective," is canceled.

02:40.495 --> 02:43.302
What? But I just finished
all these scripts.

02:43.371 --> 02:44.685
- Jeffrey, stand. Sit.
- Okay.

02:44.754 --> 02:46.646
Now, roll over
to prepare the jet!

02:46.715 --> 02:50.552
- Okay.
- Huh? You guys got a jet?

02:50.622 --> 02:51.950
You're finished in this town.

02:52.019 --> 02:54.575
There's a new star,
and his name is Tommy!

02:54.644 --> 02:57.661
Wait! Whoa! Whoa! Aw.

02:57.748 --> 03:01.250
Now, children,
there are all kinds of art.

03:01.319 --> 03:02.535
Wee!

03:02.604 --> 03:05.669
Oh, man.
Tommy got "ADD" canceled.

03:05.779 --> 03:07.373
- What?
- Oh, no!

03:07.442 --> 03:09.047
- You're the worst!
- You suck!

03:09.124 --> 03:12.250
- I did what?
- Even this is art!

03:12.327 --> 03:14.411
Ah! Ah! Aah! Aah!

03:14.488 --> 03:16.246
Good job, Tommy!

03:16.323 --> 03:19.382
You've gotten a cartoon
about drugs off the air!

03:19.459 --> 03:22.126
Tommy, my star, how would you
like to make your cartoon

03:22.203 --> 03:24.629
about a pineapple that
wears a funny hat, hmm?

03:24.706 --> 03:26.523
- Really?
- Jeffrey, stand. Speak.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.399
Okay. We'll set
your studio up here.

03:28.476 --> 03:31.394
Uh, you've got till 3 o'clock
to finish before it airs.

03:31.471 --> 03:33.838
Pick some friends to help you
make the show, Tommy,

03:33.915 --> 03:36.597
and hurry up.
Time is money!

03:36.666 --> 03:37.701
Oh!

03:37.770 --> 03:39.255
- Pick me, Tommy!
- Pick me, Tommy!

03:39.324 --> 03:40.745
Uh...

03:40.814 --> 03:43.040
Jeffrey, hurry up with
that equipment.

03:43.108 --> 03:44.927
- I'm trying to...
- Bad assistant, stand.

03:44.996 --> 03:46.250
Stop. Sit.
Shake hands.

03:46.319 --> 03:48.903
Now, get the equipment in there
quick or no dinner for you.

03:48.972 --> 03:50.096
Okay.

03:53.853 --> 03:55.601
How about an episode
where the pineapple

03:55.670 --> 03:57.030
that wears a funny hat hides

03:57.099 --> 03:59.575
in an alligator's
butthole and does drugs?

04:00.213 --> 04:02.646
No! No drugs!
What else?

04:02.715 --> 04:06.192
Pineapple does drugs,
and then he does more drugs!

04:06.640 --> 04:08.256
Pineapple doesn't do drugs.

04:08.325 --> 04:10.795
- Well, what does he do?
- He wears a funny hat!

04:10.864 --> 04:13.678
What if Pineapple's
funny hat does drugs?

04:13.755 --> 04:15.271
- Ugh!
- Wha?

04:15.348 --> 04:18.435
Where's the kid
who got my show canceled?!

04:18.531 --> 04:19.932
- Him! He did it!
- Uh...

04:20.000 --> 04:22.226
Well, I just wanted
to thank you.

04:22.295 --> 04:25.012
- Huh?
- Making cartoons is really hard,

04:25.081 --> 04:27.270
but now I have all this
free time to do...

04:27.339 --> 04:28.451
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's great.

04:28.519 --> 04:31.272
Guys, we only have till
3 o'clock to finish,

04:31.341 --> 04:33.331
and we haven't come up
with a story yet.

04:33.408 --> 04:37.293
Oh! Ha ha! You just need
some inspiration!

04:37.370 --> 04:38.903
Here, try some drugs!

04:38.980 --> 04:41.539
- Yay, drugs!
- Cool, let's do drugs!

04:41.616 --> 04:43.742
No! Drugs are bad!

04:43.819 --> 04:45.505
Aah! My drugs!

04:45.574 --> 04:46.834
- Aw.
- Stupid Tommy!

04:46.903 --> 04:48.718
- Oh, you suck, Tommy!
- Wait!

04:48.787 --> 04:51.691
There's always drugs
on the bad side of town.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.743
Come on, kids!
Let's go do drugs!

04:53.820 --> 04:55.220
- Yay, drugs!
- What? No!

04:55.297 --> 04:58.958
Mr. Pickles,
let's go get Sheriff!

04:59.159 --> 05:03.254
Ah. And done.
What the... Why, hey!

05:03.323 --> 05:04.706
Ah! What?

05:04.932 --> 05:07.022
Hi, Tommy's parents.
We work in TV.

05:07.091 --> 05:08.900
Tommy is going to make
a cartoon for us, hmm.

05:08.977 --> 05:11.327
- What?
- Absolutely not!

05:11.396 --> 05:13.838
The stuff I've seen on
cartoons is despicable!

05:13.915 --> 05:16.849
Not even for $50?

05:17.043 --> 05:18.769
Fifty big ones?

05:18.846 --> 05:21.458
Oh, I-I think we can
work something out.

05:21.527 --> 05:22.536
Drugs!

05:22.605 --> 05:25.015
Hey, look, kids,
some drug dealers!

05:25.084 --> 05:26.450
- Yay, drugs!
- Hello there.

05:26.527 --> 05:29.052
Me and these kids
want to get some drugs.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.060
Uh, okay, here.

05:31.225 --> 05:34.725
Wait.
You need to give us money.

05:34.794 --> 05:37.187
Uh, y-yeah, yeah.
You got some money?

05:37.264 --> 05:39.497
Uh, I'll pay you
back tomorrow?

05:39.566 --> 05:40.983
- Uh...
- Okay.

05:41.052 --> 05:42.592
- We trust you.
- Freeze!

05:42.661 --> 05:45.717
Geez, you guys are the worst
drug dealers I've ever seen.

05:45.786 --> 05:48.698
Doink! Come on, kids!
Let's go do drugs!

05:48.775 --> 05:50.142
- Yay, drugs!
- Oh, no!

05:50.219 --> 05:51.868
Mr. Pickles, stop them!

05:51.945 --> 05:53.411
Sorry to burst your bubble,

05:53.488 --> 05:55.872
but you drug dealers
are in big trouble!

05:55.941 --> 05:57.541
Oh, hey, that would be
a good song lyric.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.117
Here, hold this a sec.

05:59.194 --> 06:02.078

06:02.155 --> 06:03.988

N-Now, you got to die.

06:09.496 --> 06:11.296
You, uh, uh, and the kid.

06:11.373 --> 06:13.724
Please, I have
a cartoon to finish.

06:13.793 --> 06:14.849
- Really?
- Really?

06:14.918 --> 06:16.950
You need voice actors?

06:17.019 --> 06:20.397
I'm a leprechaun.
Now, I'm a robot.

06:20.466 --> 06:23.247
Now... Now, I'm
a leprechaun again.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.452
- You're amazing!
- Really?

06:25.521 --> 06:28.104
Hey, look,

06:28.181 --> 06:29.914
Eh, didn't seem believable.

06:29.991 --> 06:32.317
Shut up,
or I'll kill you, pig.

06:32.394 --> 06:34.911
Now, that was
a believable farmer.

06:34.988 --> 06:36.454
You should hire these guys.

06:36.531 --> 06:39.015
Come on, kids.
Let's do these drugs!

06:39.092 --> 06:40.492
Yum yum yum yum yum.

06:40.569 --> 06:43.094
These drugs should
kick in any sec.

06:43.171 --> 06:45.388
Whoa-oa-oa!

06:45.465 --> 06:47.390
Hey, where'd he go?

06:47.467 --> 06:49.433
And sign here, here, here,
here, here, here...

06:49.510 --> 06:50.627
Jeffrey, hurry up.

06:50.704 --> 06:52.346
Here, here, here, here,
here, here, here, here.

06:52.414 --> 06:53.697
Jeffrey, stand.
Sit. Stand. Sit.

06:53.774 --> 06:55.043
Shake hands.
Now, give him the check.

06:55.111 --> 06:55.737
Okay.

06:55.806 --> 06:57.644
Wow, 50 big ones!
Oh, boy!

06:57.750 --> 07:00.214
Wait.
So Tommy is making a cartoon?

07:00.287 --> 07:02.050
Yes.
Tommy had a brilliant idea

07:02.128 --> 07:04.207
about a pineapple
that wears a funny hat.

07:04.276 --> 07:05.276
Oh, wow.

07:05.352 --> 07:07.327
Mr. Pickles is dragging
somebody into his doghouse.

07:07.395 --> 07:10.355
Oh, you just missed him.
That dog is evil!

07:10.432 --> 07:12.857
Dad, stop with
your crazy stories.

07:12.934 --> 07:14.050
An evil dog?

07:14.127 --> 07:16.152
- Ooh.
- Please, go on.

07:16.229 --> 07:18.121
Really?
Well, Mr. Pickles has

07:18.198 --> 07:20.790
a lair under his doghouse
with a river of blood!

07:20.867 --> 07:23.534
He has three leather-wearing
Steves that guard his lair.

07:23.611 --> 07:26.917
One of them was my wife, but
he shot her into outer space.

07:26.986 --> 07:29.169
Did I mention
the river of blood?

07:29.375 --> 07:31.133
All right.
The script is done.

07:31.210 --> 07:34.512
Sheriff, you record the voices.
I'll animate. Move it, people!

07:34.581 --> 07:37.776
We've only got an hour
to finish the cartoon.

07:37.969 --> 07:40.270
- Action.
- The hat I-is funny.

07:40.395 --> 07:42.433
Cut.
Try it with more passion.

07:42.502 --> 07:44.819
The hat I-is funny.

07:45.225 --> 07:47.327
Good enough.
Action.

07:47.396 --> 07:49.085
This is a funny hat.

07:49.162 --> 07:51.596
Cut. It's funnier
if you emphasize funny.

07:51.673 --> 07:56.501
One more note, and I'll
show you what's fu-u-u-nny...

07:56.578 --> 07:57.835
You, dead.

07:58.764 --> 08:01.005
See, now, you're getting
the hang of this.

08:01.082 --> 08:03.633
What? Huh? Where am I?

08:03.710 --> 08:07.036
Whoa! These drugs are great.
Yum yum yum.

08:07.113 --> 08:09.547
Ha ha! I can't believe
what I'm seeing.

08:11.284 --> 08:14.719
Whoa, look at all the colors.
Let's go higher!

08:14.796 --> 08:16.312
Yum yum yum.

08:16.389 --> 08:18.523

Yum yum yum.

08:19.518 --> 08:21.196
Whoa!

08:21.579 --> 08:24.004

08:24.964 --> 08:30.156
Whoa, it looks like my arms
and legs are missing, cool!

08:30.225 --> 08:32.909
Whoa!

08:33.440 --> 08:40.744
Whoa. It feels like
my face is melting.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.642
Yeah!

08:43.116 --> 08:44.715
Everybody, listen up.

08:44.792 --> 08:47.918
Now I present to you
a brand-new cartoon

08:47.995 --> 08:50.980
by our very own Tommy Goodman!

08:51.057 --> 08:54.492
- Way to go, Tommy! $50!
- Yay, Tommy!

08:56.330 --> 08:59.655
I'm a pineapple.
Look at me walk.

08:59.732 --> 09:01.490
Hey, pineap... ple.

09:01.567 --> 09:03.174
W-W-Want some drugs?

09:03.243 --> 09:04.752
Drugs are bad.

09:04.927 --> 09:06.010
Oh.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.504
We...
We will be nice now.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.689
Also, the is hat is funny.

09:13.079 --> 09:15.079
Want to wear
my funny hat?

09:15.531 --> 09:16.956
Yeah.

09:17.984 --> 09:21.806
This is a fu-u-u-nny hat.

09:24.895 --> 09:27.020
W-We don't do drugs

'cause you told us
the hat I-is funny.

09:30.830 --> 09:34.090
Right. And that is the end
of this cartoon.

09:34.167 --> 09:36.501
Cut. Hey, this cartoon
needs some theme music.

09:36.578 --> 09:38.303
Sheriff,
don't interrupt me.

09:38.380 --> 09:41.673
Ugh, now, I have to start
the cartoon over again.

09:43.510 --> 09:46.143
I'm a pineapple.
Look at me walk.

09:46.220 --> 09:49.272
- Boo! Boo!
- This cartoon sucks!

09:49.349 --> 09:50.807
What are you doing?

09:50.884 --> 09:52.517
Our voices were... great.

09:52.594 --> 09:55.119
But Tommy's cartoon
was terrible.

09:55.196 --> 09:57.480
Now... Now,
you got to die.

09:57.557 --> 10:01.617
If you think it's so easy, why
don't you make your own cartoon?

10:01.694 --> 10:03.795
Perfect. Tommy, you're fired.
You're hired.

10:03.872 --> 10:04.921
- What?
- Yay.

10:04.998 --> 10:06.556
We won't sell drugs
no more.

10:06.633 --> 10:08.699
- Then, where will we get drugs?
- Yeah!

10:08.776 --> 10:14.163
Aah! Argh!
Drugs did this to me! Aah!

10:14.320 --> 10:17.099
And that's why
drugs are bad.

10:23.791 --> 10:24.840
Hooray!

10:24.917 --> 10:27.084
And authorities are still
looking for a suspect

10:27.161 --> 10:29.053
in the murder
of this TV executive.

10:29.130 --> 10:31.414
It was an evil dog
named Mr. Pickles.

Ha ha! That's crazy.
