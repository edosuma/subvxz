00:00.676 --> 00:02.652
<i>Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:03.654 --> 00:05.028
<i>Let's go, bro.</i>

00:05.029 --> 00:06.407
A challenge that began
as a run through the streets...

00:06.408 --> 00:07.758
Well done.

00:07.759 --> 00:09.137
Evolved into
a race in the kitchen...

00:09.138 --> 00:10.513
Coming through!

00:10.514 --> 00:12.429
As each team had
to make a healthy lunch

00:12.430 --> 00:13.797
for a room full of runners.

00:13.798 --> 00:15.899
I've got eight-year-old girls
in the dining room,

00:15.900 --> 00:16.933
this salmon's raw!

00:16.934 --> 00:18.201
Raw!

00:18.202 --> 00:19.636
Last ticket.

00:19.637 --> 00:20.637
And for the
third consecutive time...

00:20.638 --> 00:21.905
Ladies, well done.

00:23.474 --> 00:25.475
The blue team
lost the challenge...

00:25.476 --> 00:26.977
I am over this.

00:26.978 --> 00:29.413
And were stuck
cleaning up the race course.

00:29.414 --> 00:30.680
Oh, God.

00:30.681 --> 00:32.682
Hey, look at me, mom!
I'm on a chain gang.

00:32.683 --> 00:34.151
While the
victorious red team...

00:34.152 --> 00:36.920
Have any of you bitches
ever lost a challenge?

00:36.921 --> 00:38.088
No!

00:39.524 --> 00:41.591
Took a private
jet to the wine country.

00:41.592 --> 00:43.894
We splash the competition.

00:46.431 --> 00:47.764
But at dinner service...

00:47.765 --> 00:49.065
Wake up!
Come on, Jacqueline!

00:49.066 --> 00:50.133
Yes, chef.
Yes, chef.

00:50.134 --> 00:51.168
The red team struggled.

00:51.169 --> 00:52.169
Is this a joke for you?

00:52.170 --> 00:53.503
No, chef.

00:53.504 --> 00:54.504
Jessica was
slow with the Risotto...

00:54.505 --> 00:55.505
Jessica!
Yes, chef!

00:55.506 --> 00:57.007
Do you have a second gear?

00:57.008 --> 00:59.476
And Danielle
butchered the meats.

01:00.845 --> 01:01.978
But worst of all...

01:01.979 --> 01:02.979
Ladies!

01:02.980 --> 01:03.980
Yes, chef!

01:03.981 --> 01:05.449
Pink chicken.

01:05.450 --> 01:07.584
Jacqueline served
up undercooked chicken.

01:07.585 --> 01:09.719
There's certain things
you can't do in a kitchen!

01:09.720 --> 01:11.455
On the blue side...

01:11.456 --> 01:12.489
ing bumping me again.

01:12.490 --> 01:14.024
Don't bump me.

01:14.025 --> 01:16.026
Dan and Michael's
bad blood boiled over...

01:16.027 --> 01:17.694
Get the out of here!

01:17.695 --> 01:18.895
<i>Get out!</i>

01:18.896 --> 01:20.197
And chef
Ramsay had to referee.

01:20.198 --> 01:22.199
What the
is going on with you two?

01:22.200 --> 01:24.000
But the men bounced back.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.703
Blue team!
Last ticket, well done.

01:26.704 --> 01:27.704
And finally...

01:27.705 --> 01:28.839
The blue team.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.106
Yeah!
Yes!

01:30.107 --> 01:31.508
Got a victory.

01:31.509 --> 01:32.943
Oh, my God.

01:32.944 --> 01:35.245
The women
selected two for elimination.

01:35.246 --> 01:36.246
Danielle.

01:36.247 --> 01:37.247
And...

01:37.248 --> 01:38.615
Jessica, chef.

01:38.616 --> 01:39.916
But chef Ramsay
added one of his own.

01:39.917 --> 01:42.919
Jacqueline.
Get your ass up here.

01:42.920 --> 01:43.954
In the end...

01:43.955 --> 01:45.755
Danielle, give me your jacket.

01:45.756 --> 01:48.325
Danielle's dream of
becoming head chef of Gordon Ramsay

01:48.326 --> 01:51.761
Pub & Grill at Caesar's Palace
went up in smoke.

01:56.801 --> 01:58.268
* Fire

01:58.269 --> 02:00.303
Whoa!

02:00.304 --> 02:03.373
* The way you swerve
and curve *

02:03.374 --> 02:05.208

02:07.512 --> 02:09.112

02:12.483 --> 02:14.451

02:14.452 --> 02:15.919

02:23.427 --> 02:25.462

02:44.749 --> 02:46.650

03:00.331 --> 03:03.567
<i>And now,
the continuation of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

03:04.835 --> 03:06.970
Piss off.

03:10.908 --> 03:12.142
I should
know how to do this,

03:12.143 --> 03:13.910
this is what I do for a living.

03:13.911 --> 03:16.413
I'm feeling like a giant
pile of .

03:16.414 --> 03:18.281
I really thought I was going.

03:18.282 --> 03:20.050
I really did.

03:20.051 --> 03:22.452
I can't ever let
that happen again.

03:22.453 --> 03:24.688
I still can't wrap
my head around Jackie

03:24.689 --> 03:26.289
and the pink chicken.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.725
I mean, come on.

03:28.726 --> 03:31.328
, dude.

03:31.329 --> 03:33.463
<i>It was hard for
me to go up there, like,</i>

03:33.464 --> 03:36.066
you're my team and you're
putting me up there because I...

03:36.067 --> 03:38.268
I don't know what I did.

03:38.269 --> 03:41.171
I'm not the weakest
chef here, by far.

03:41.172 --> 03:43.607
I just feel like
the red team is out to get me.

03:43.608 --> 03:47.777
I proved myself tonight,
so watch out, girls.

03:47.778 --> 03:51.348
Because I'm definitely
gonna prove myself even more.

03:51.349 --> 03:54.017
You know, it really
was stupid of us

03:54.018 --> 03:56.186
to nominate Jessica
for the reasons we did.

03:56.187 --> 03:57.253
Yeah.

03:57.254 --> 03:59.122
I'm sorry that
you went up there.

03:59.123 --> 04:00.657
No hard feelings.

04:00.658 --> 04:03.159
No.
Okay?

04:03.160 --> 04:04.461
To finally winning.

04:04.462 --> 04:07.430
Oh, so glad we ing won!

04:07.431 --> 04:11.334
We finally won a service.
It was amazing.

04:12.336 --> 04:13.937
<i>We got the monkey off our back.</i>

04:13.938 --> 04:15.605
It's kind of awesome.

04:15.606 --> 04:17.040
This is the spark
that we needed

04:17.041 --> 04:18.942
to just get everything rolling.

04:18.942 --> 04:21.344
This is absolutely a new
beginning for the blue team.

04:21.345 --> 04:22.345
I feel like we got this.

04:22.346 --> 04:25.415
It can be done.
It can be done.

04:25.416 --> 04:28.051
Riding high after
their first dinner service win...

04:28.052 --> 04:29.653
Let's do it again.

04:29.654 --> 04:31.388
The blue team looks
to turn it into a streak...

04:31.389 --> 04:32.956
That's good!
A little spring in your step.

04:32.957 --> 04:35.191
By winning
their first challenge.

04:35.192 --> 04:36.926
Oh, my.

04:36.927 --> 04:40.597
All I see is this market
of all these beautiful,

04:40.598 --> 04:42.065
beautiful proteins.

04:42.066 --> 04:44.834
There's just row
upon row of veal, lamb...

04:44.835 --> 04:47.971
you've got some seafood
that I've never even heard of.

04:47.972 --> 04:50.840
Mm, it's making me hungry.

04:50.841 --> 04:53.143
As you know, we've lost
a number of weak individuals.

04:53.144 --> 04:55.745
But I am still looking
for the real chefs,

04:55.746 --> 04:57.580
the real talent, to emerge.

04:57.581 --> 05:01.518
And one thing that separates
the chefs from the cooks

05:01.519 --> 05:03.219
is their palates.

05:03.220 --> 05:07.991
For today's challenge,
each team will need to identify

05:07.992 --> 05:11.661
the five proteins
under those domes.

05:11.662 --> 05:13.263
This is a palate challenge.
Are you ing me?

05:13.264 --> 05:14.631
I've trained for this,
doing this all my life.

05:14.632 --> 05:16.633
I mean, I could tell you
if it's cat or dog.

05:18.069 --> 05:20.370
Within each team,
thers goe'a be four pairs.

05:20.371 --> 05:22.806
The first pair will go up,
taste the dish,

05:22.807 --> 05:26.576
and decide together
which protein is in the dish.

05:26.577 --> 05:29.345
Then they'll run over to
our fabulous market behind me

05:29.346 --> 05:30.814
and find that protein.

05:30.815 --> 05:33.349
If you're right,
the green light will come on.

05:33.350 --> 05:36.286
The team that identifies
the five proteins

05:36.287 --> 05:37.954
under the domes
in the fastest time

05:37.955 --> 05:40.090
wins the challenge, got it?

05:40.091 --> 05:42.092
Yes, chef.

05:42.093 --> 05:45.195
Realize the first pair
will get two turns.

05:45.196 --> 05:47.564
Blue team,
you won dinner service,

05:47.565 --> 05:49.065
so you'll go first.

05:49.066 --> 05:51.201
Ladies, head up to the dorms.
Off you go.

05:51.202 --> 05:52.235
Yes, chef.

05:52.236 --> 05:53.303
<i>Let's go.</i>

05:53.304 --> 05:56.706
Okay, blue team.
Who's going first?

05:56.707 --> 05:59.375
It's me and Mike first.
We are the dynamic duo.

05:59.376 --> 06:01.511
There's no way
we can lose this thing.

06:01.512 --> 06:03.179
Ready? Set.

06:03.180 --> 06:04.314
I'll pull the dome.

06:04.315 --> 06:05.882
Go! Let's go.

06:05.883 --> 06:07.751
In today's
match-the-protein challenge...

06:07.752 --> 06:09.219
<i>Great, meatballs.</i>

06:09.220 --> 06:11.287
The chefs must
identify the correct protein

06:11.288 --> 06:14.290
chef Ramsay has used
in his five dishes...

06:14.291 --> 06:15.425
<i>Let's go.
30 seconds gone.</i>

06:15.426 --> 06:16.693
It's not beef.
It's not beef.

06:16.694 --> 06:19.028
From a
selection of 50 options.

06:19.029 --> 06:20.130
You want to go with lamb?

06:20.131 --> 06:21.464
<i>Yeah, let's go lamb.</i>

06:21.465 --> 06:22.499
Hurry up, hurry up.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.533
Run back.

06:23.534 --> 06:24.534
Lamb.

06:24.535 --> 06:25.535
Wrong! Let's go!

06:25.536 --> 06:26.536
Let's go, hustle back.

06:26.537 --> 06:28.371
<i>Take it back!</i>

06:28.372 --> 06:29.539
Let's go, venison. Let's go.

06:29.540 --> 06:30.740
Come on, come on, come on!

06:30.741 --> 06:31.741
Venison.

06:31.742 --> 06:33.109
Wrong! Come on!

06:33.110 --> 06:34.511
It's not as easy as it looks.

06:34.512 --> 06:35.612
So I'm tasting it,

06:35.613 --> 06:37.413
I'm taking as many
bites as I can,

06:37.414 --> 06:38.748
but the tomato sauce
wasn't helping.

06:38.749 --> 06:40.183
'Cause you just couldn't
really taste the meat.

06:40.184 --> 06:41.184
Veal.
Veal, chef.

06:41.185 --> 06:42.852
Wrong! Come on!

06:42.853 --> 06:44.320
<i>Keep it moving.
Come on, guys.</i>

06:44.321 --> 06:45.321
Pork, chef.

06:45.322 --> 06:46.322
Wrong!

06:46.323 --> 06:48.124
<i>Holy crap, come on!</i>

06:48.125 --> 06:49.425
Now I'm getting concerned.

06:49.426 --> 06:50.760
They're running up,
they're running back.

06:50.761 --> 06:51.761
They're running up,
they're running back.

06:51.762 --> 06:52.762
Buffalo, chef.

06:52.763 --> 06:54.063
Wrong!

06:54.064 --> 06:56.299
They're running up,
they're running back.

06:56.300 --> 06:57.534
Rabbit.

06:57.535 --> 06:58.568
Rabbit meatball?
off!

06:58.569 --> 07:00.036
Oh, .

07:00.037 --> 07:01.037
Goat, chef.

07:01.038 --> 07:02.205
Wrong!

07:02.206 --> 07:03.339
Goat meatball?

07:03.340 --> 07:04.808
It's possible, chef.

07:04.809 --> 07:08.244
I've actually had goat meatballs
and they're delicious.

07:08.245 --> 07:09.612
What other meat is there?

07:09.613 --> 07:11.014
The kangaroo,
we haven't done yet.

07:11.015 --> 07:12.715
All right.
Come on.

07:12.716 --> 07:13.716
Kangaroo, chef.

07:13.717 --> 07:14.717
Wrong!

07:14.718 --> 07:15.785
, man.

07:15.786 --> 07:17.086
<i>Are you hopping mad?</i>

07:17.087 --> 07:18.621
When was the last time
you had a kangaroo meatball?

07:18.622 --> 07:19.889
Never, chef.

07:19.890 --> 07:20.990
What could it be?
What could it be?

07:20.991 --> 07:23.927
Come on!
It's so easy!

07:23.928 --> 07:25.228
Let's go look at it.

07:25.229 --> 07:26.696
I feel like I'm completely
letting my team down

07:26.697 --> 07:27.797
at this point.

07:27.798 --> 07:29.098
I feel like I need
to just stop, think,

07:29.099 --> 07:30.300
and go, "What is it?"

07:30.301 --> 07:31.467
Look at the color.

07:31.468 --> 07:32.635
You can do it.

07:32.636 --> 07:33.770
<i>There you go.
There we go.</i>

07:33.771 --> 07:34.971
Turkey!

07:34.972 --> 07:36.206
<i>Yes!</i>

07:36.207 --> 07:37.473
<i>Thank you, chef.
Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>

07:37.474 --> 07:38.875
It's now up to Dan and Zach...

07:38.876 --> 07:40.710
4 1/2 minutes, Michael, Jon!

07:40.711 --> 07:42.412
<i>That was terrible.</i>

07:42.413 --> 07:45.248
To make up for Michael
and jon's unbelievably slow start.

07:45.249 --> 07:46.416
<i>Tacos?</i>

07:46.417 --> 07:47.417
<i>Come on!</i>

07:47.418 --> 07:48.418
I know tacos.

07:48.419 --> 07:50.386
I trust my palate immaculately.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.855
Instantly,
I'm thinking chicken.

07:51.856 --> 07:53.389
Come on, come on!

07:53.390 --> 07:55.024
<i>Chicken, chef. Well done!</i>

07:55.025 --> 07:56.025
Yes! Yes!

07:56.026 --> 07:57.493
All right, guys.
Good job, guys.

07:57.494 --> 07:59.696
Just that simple.
Not rocket science.

08:02.333 --> 08:04.400
<i>Enchiladas.
Think Mexican food.</i>

08:04.401 --> 08:06.636
Come on, Barret.
Come on, Jeremy!

08:06.637 --> 08:08.004
It's pork.

08:08.005 --> 08:10.039
Enchiladas are a Mexican dish,
and I'm picking animals

08:10.040 --> 08:11.507
that would be in that area.

08:11.508 --> 08:12.542
Pork, chef.

08:12.543 --> 08:13.776
Wrong!
Come on, let's go!

08:13.777 --> 08:14.811
Let's go, let's go.

08:14.812 --> 08:15.845
Run it back, run it back.

08:15.846 --> 08:17.847
Keep it simple!
What goes with enchiladas?

08:17.848 --> 08:18.848
Venison, chef.

08:18.849 --> 08:20.350
Wrong! Let's go!

08:20.351 --> 08:22.919
It's a dark meat.
Tough and chewy.

08:22.920 --> 08:23.987
Buffalo.

08:23.988 --> 08:25.255
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

08:25.256 --> 08:26.256
Buffalo, chef.

08:26.257 --> 08:27.323
<i>Wrong! Come on!</i>

08:27.324 --> 08:29.192
! Get it right!
What is it?

08:29.193 --> 08:30.193
Veal, chef!

08:30.194 --> 08:32.361
No! Come on! Wrong!

08:32.363 --> 08:33.796
Come on, come on, come on!

08:33.797 --> 08:34.797
<i>Run, run, run, run!</i>

08:34.798 --> 08:35.965
Hey, duck!

08:35.966 --> 08:36.966
I mean, I don't even
have to taste it.

08:36.967 --> 08:38.268
I can see it
from six feet away.

08:38.269 --> 08:39.335
Jeremy, look at me!

08:39.336 --> 08:40.336
Grab the duck.
Grab the duck, quick.

08:40.337 --> 08:41.638
Just get it. Come on! Grab it!

08:41.639 --> 08:42.705
Come on!

08:42.706 --> 08:43.773
Go, go, go, go!

08:43.774 --> 08:45.508
Duck, chef.
Yes!

08:45.509 --> 08:47.443
Aah! Yes.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.045
I'll do these.

08:49.046 --> 08:50.713
We are 8 1/2 minutes
in right now.

08:50.714 --> 08:53.583
Me and Ray have got
to nail this dish.

08:53.584 --> 08:54.651
<i>It's on the bone.</i>

08:54.652 --> 08:55.652
What do you think?
What do you think?

08:55.653 --> 08:56.653
Let me look at it.

08:56.654 --> 08:58.021
I close my eyes, I taste it.

08:58.022 --> 09:00.189
It reminds me of back home,
the veal cutlet mom makes.

09:00.190 --> 09:01.224
It's veal.

09:01.225 --> 09:02.225
Veal!
Veal, chef.

09:02.226 --> 09:03.293
Yes! Well done!

09:03.294 --> 09:04.794
Some you just know.

09:04.795 --> 09:06.095
<i>Go! Last one.</i>

09:06.096 --> 09:07.530
<i>Come on, chef
Mike, chef Jon!</i>

09:07.531 --> 09:08.731
Bring it home!

09:08.732 --> 09:09.732
<i>Think of fish.</i>

09:09.733 --> 09:11.501
<i>What does it say
to your palate?</i>

09:11.502 --> 09:13.202
This is a good chance
for me to redeem myself.

09:13.203 --> 09:15.939
If I can get this
in one or two tries,

09:15.940 --> 09:17.840
maybe we can stop this clock
and win this challenge.

09:17.841 --> 09:19.475
Is it cod?
No!

09:19.476 --> 09:20.476
Try catfish!

09:20.477 --> 09:22.946
Think flaky.
Flaky, buttery, man.

09:22.947 --> 09:24.247
Sturgeon?
Yeah.

09:24.248 --> 09:25.315
Let's go with sturgeon.

09:25.316 --> 09:26.449
Let's go!
Quick, quick.

09:26.450 --> 09:27.450
Sturgeon.

09:27.451 --> 09:28.551
No!

09:28.552 --> 09:30.119
We didn't say sturgeon!

09:30.120 --> 09:31.354
<i>Catfish, guys!</i>

09:31.355 --> 09:32.355
<i>Dude, here, come here.</i>

09:32.356 --> 09:33.356
Swordfish?
Grab it.

09:33.357 --> 09:35.625
Go, go, go, go!

09:35.626 --> 09:36.993
Is it swordfish fish and chips?

09:36.994 --> 09:38.161
<i>Swordfish.
Yes!</i>

09:40.397 --> 09:42.832
<i>Wow, blue team.</i>

09:42.833 --> 09:45.201
Over-thinking again.

09:45.202 --> 09:48.071
<i>10 minutes, 33 seconds.</i>

09:48.072 --> 09:50.006
me.

09:50.007 --> 09:51.341
We could've got that in five.

09:51.342 --> 09:54.210
I hope these girls struggle
just as much as us.

09:54.211 --> 09:55.311
Okay.

09:55.312 --> 09:58.481
Let me show you
what the blue team got.

09:58.482 --> 09:59.983
<i>That will be the time to beat.</i>

09:59.984 --> 10:01.617
Over ten minutes, guys?

10:01.618 --> 10:03.019
I mean, what took you so long?

10:03.020 --> 10:05.188
If we don't beat their time,
we're pathetic.

10:05.189 --> 10:06.856
All you need to do it
is in 10:32,

10:06.857 --> 10:07.924
<i>and you have won.</i>

10:07.925 --> 10:10.960
Now this clock
will be counting down.

10:10.961 --> 10:12.362
<i>Who's going first, please?</i>

10:12.363 --> 10:14.364
<i>Ja'nel and Jacqueline.</i>

10:14.365 --> 10:15.365
Are you ready?

10:15.366 --> 10:16.566
Yes, chef.

10:16.567 --> 10:18.768
Set, go!

10:18.769 --> 10:19.869
<i>Let's go.</i>

10:19.870 --> 10:21.070
Come on, girls.

10:21.071 --> 10:22.305
Take your time, take your time.

10:22.306 --> 10:24.841
We cut into the meatball
and it's white,

10:24.842 --> 10:26.576
so, I know that it's not beef.

10:26.577 --> 10:28.378
It kind of narrows it down,

10:28.379 --> 10:29.979
and we've got a pretty good idea
of what it could be.

10:29.980 --> 10:31.280
Let's go Turkey.
Turkey?

10:31.281 --> 10:32.382
<i>Let's go!</i>

10:32.383 --> 10:33.549
<i>Turkey.
Well done.</i>

10:33.550 --> 10:34.650
<i>Great job.
Yes, yes, yes!</i>

10:34.651 --> 10:36.052
<i>Let's go, ladies.
Oh, man.</i>

10:36.053 --> 10:37.987
These girls are gonna
finish this challenge

10:37.988 --> 10:39.322
in less time it took
me and Mike to figure out

10:39.323 --> 10:41.824
there was Turkey
in the meatballs.

10:41.825 --> 10:43.226
Come on, Cyndi.
Come on, Susan.

10:43.227 --> 10:44.527
My heart is pumping.

10:44.528 --> 10:45.962
I'm throwin'
In my mouth right now.

10:45.963 --> 10:46.996
I'm just trying
to taste things.

10:46.997 --> 10:48.464
It's definitely a poultry.

10:48.465 --> 10:49.932
Be confident.
Don't worry.

10:49.933 --> 10:51.634
<i>There we go, quickly.</i>

10:51.635 --> 10:52.802
<i>I wanna hear you.</i>

10:52.803 --> 10:54.537
Chicken, chef.
Congratulations.

10:54.538 --> 10:56.339
Good job.

10:56.340 --> 10:58.107
Hell, yes!
Good job.

10:58.108 --> 11:00.143
<i>Come on, Jessica.
Come on, Nedra.</i>

11:00.144 --> 11:01.377
We had enchiladas,

11:01.378 --> 11:02.845
and we were looking
at the sauce, it was red.

11:02.846 --> 11:06.616
So I'm thinking,
"Red sauce, red meat."

11:06.617 --> 11:08.217
Are you sure?
Yeah, venison.

11:08.218 --> 11:09.685
Call it out. Call it out.
Call it out.

11:09.686 --> 11:10.686
Venison, chef.

11:10.687 --> 11:12.488
<i>Wrong!</i>

11:12.489 --> 11:13.990
God, I hope these girls
do terrible.

11:13.991 --> 11:16.959
I mean, we haven't
won a challenge yet.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.529
Let something catastrophic
happen, please.

11:19.530 --> 11:20.596
Veal, chef.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.432
No!
Let's go.

11:22.433 --> 11:23.666
Grab the next one.
What do you think it is?

11:23.667 --> 11:24.700
Buffalo.

11:24.701 --> 11:25.768
<i>No!</i>

11:25.769 --> 11:27.136
It's okay.
Don't give up.

11:27.137 --> 11:28.204
<i>Just keep trying.</i>

11:28.205 --> 11:29.939
Beef, chef.
No!

11:29.940 --> 11:31.741
Keep going.
Move fast, move fast.

11:31.742 --> 11:32.909
<i>Squab.
No!</i>

11:32.910 --> 11:34.710
It's okay.
Come on, ladies!

11:34.711 --> 11:36.212
Don't give up.

11:36.213 --> 11:38.714
Quail.
No!

11:38.715 --> 11:39.816
Oh, .

11:39.817 --> 11:41.417
Nedra and Jessica,
they look like

11:41.418 --> 11:43.286
me and Mike on those meatballs.

11:43.287 --> 11:45.188
<i>Taste it again, guys!</i>

11:45.189 --> 11:46.923
Feel it, smell it, touch it.

11:46.924 --> 11:48.558
Take your time.
Embrace it.

11:48.559 --> 11:50.693
Embrace the moment.

11:50.694 --> 11:51.828
Six minutes!

11:51.829 --> 11:53.229
You guys don't have much time.
Come on!

11:53.230 --> 11:54.630
Our clock is ticking.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.299
We're getting down too far.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.034
And I'm seriously
getting nervous.

11:58.035 --> 11:59.335
These girls have
got to figure out

11:59.336 --> 12:00.436
what's in this enchilada.

12:00.437 --> 12:01.604
Rabbit, chef?

12:01.605 --> 12:02.605
No!

12:02.606 --> 12:03.606
What the ?

12:03.607 --> 12:04.941
Try the goat.

12:04.942 --> 12:06.042
Kangaroo?

12:06.043 --> 12:07.043
Kangaroo.

12:07.044 --> 12:08.411
I saw kangaroo.
I was like,

12:08.412 --> 12:11.714
"Anything's possible
in Hell's Kitchen."

12:11.715 --> 12:12.815
Kangaroo?

12:12.816 --> 12:13.816
No!

12:13.817 --> 12:15.017
Come on, guys!

12:15.018 --> 12:16.953
Oh, I thought it was kangaroo.

12:16.954 --> 12:18.387
You still have plenty of time.

12:18.388 --> 12:19.489
Come on!

12:19.490 --> 12:21.190
Did we do veal?
We already did veal.

12:21.191 --> 12:23.359
<i>The clock is ticking away.</i>

12:23.360 --> 12:25.628
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

12:25.629 --> 12:27.163
My mind is completely blank.

12:27.164 --> 12:29.732
I don't know.
I don't know.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.074

12:38.743 --> 12:41.111
In today's
match-the-protein challenge,

12:41.112 --> 12:44.247
the men posted a time
of 10 minutes and 33 seconds.

12:44.248 --> 12:46.583
The women got off
to a good start,

12:46.584 --> 12:48.485
but Nedra and Jessica's
inability

12:48.486 --> 12:49.920
to identify the duck...

12:49.921 --> 12:51.354
Quail.
No!

12:51.355 --> 12:53.089
Rabbit, chef?
No!

12:53.090 --> 12:54.858
Kangaroo.
No!

12:54.859 --> 12:56.459
Come on, guys.

12:56.460 --> 12:58.795
Is eating away
at the red team's time,

12:58.796 --> 13:00.530
and renewing the men's hope

13:00.531 --> 13:02.499
of winning
their first challenge.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.301
Did we do veal?
We already did veal.

13:04.302 --> 13:06.603
<i>The clock is ticking away.</i>

13:06.604 --> 13:07.704
Try the goat!

13:07.705 --> 13:09.239
Um...
Come on, come on, come on.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.440
Which one do we pick?

13:10.441 --> 13:11.942
My team's gonna kill me.

13:11.943 --> 13:13.276
I'm sweating
like two fat bitches.

13:13.277 --> 13:14.811
I'm shaking like a stripper.

13:14.812 --> 13:16.813
I hope we get
the next one right.

13:16.814 --> 13:18.315
Duck.

13:18.316 --> 13:19.316
Yes!

13:20.651 --> 13:21.818
Go, go, go, go!

13:21.819 --> 13:24.821
Nedra and Jessica ate up
so much of the clock.

13:24.822 --> 13:26.056
So we have to get this done

13:26.057 --> 13:29.059
in one or two tries, tops.

13:29.060 --> 13:30.327
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

13:30.328 --> 13:31.361
<i>You got this. You got this.</i>

13:31.362 --> 13:32.662
Immediately,
I just notice the bone.

13:32.663 --> 13:34.097
It's bigger than a pork chop.

13:34.098 --> 13:35.699
I taste it, just to be sure.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.200
I think it's a veal chop.

13:37.201 --> 13:38.935
Let's go, quickly.
I like that, I like that.

13:38.936 --> 13:40.704
<i>You look confident.
Go, ladies.</i>

13:40.705 --> 13:41.705
Veal, chef!

13:41.706 --> 13:42.706
Is it veal?
Yes!

13:42.707 --> 13:43.707
Whoo!

13:43.708 --> 13:45.342
It's veal! Whoo!

13:45.343 --> 13:48.078
Mary the butcher came through.

13:48.079 --> 13:50.213
<i>Keep going, ladies.
Keep going, keep going.</i>

13:50.214 --> 13:51.681
<i>Be fast.</i>

13:51.682 --> 13:52.849
<i>You've got it.
You've got it.</i>

13:52.850 --> 13:54.584
We're screwed.
They have one dish left.

13:54.585 --> 13:56.686
I hope they start
screwing some stuff up.

13:56.687 --> 13:58.255
Please, God.

13:58.256 --> 14:00.056
Catfish, catfish.

14:00.057 --> 14:01.258
I ain't worried about nothing.

14:01.259 --> 14:02.893
There's only so much white fish

14:02.894 --> 14:03.894
we could put up there.

14:03.895 --> 14:04.961
<i>Catfish!
No!</i>

14:04.962 --> 14:05.996
Cod, cod, cod.

14:05.997 --> 14:07.464
I love that red light.

14:07.465 --> 14:09.332
This is all I want to see.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.333
Let's keep this up.

14:10.334 --> 14:12.068
Waste that time, please.

14:12.069 --> 14:13.270
Cod!

14:13.271 --> 14:14.371
No!

14:14.372 --> 14:15.705
<i>Try trout.</i>

14:15.706 --> 14:16.806
No, it's not trout.
It's not fishy enough.

14:16.807 --> 14:18.141
Halibut.

14:18.142 --> 14:19.309
Come on, shout it out.
Halibut, chef.

14:19.310 --> 14:21.144
No!
Taste it again.

14:21.145 --> 14:22.212
Time is ticking.

14:22.213 --> 14:24.214
They need to figure it out.

14:24.215 --> 14:26.016
Don't taste the breading,
just taste the fish.

14:26.017 --> 14:27.517
Savor the flavor, ladies.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.085
<i>Process of elimination.
What else could it be?</i>

14:29.086 --> 14:31.187
Take your time, ladies.
Think it out.

14:31.188 --> 14:33.423
<i>Don't give up, keep going.
Move fast, move fast.</i>

14:33.424 --> 14:35.592
Get the tilapia.

14:35.593 --> 14:36.927
Here it is. I got it. Got it?

14:36.928 --> 14:38.795
Come on, come on, come on.
Shout it out.

14:38.796 --> 14:40.163
Swordfish, swordfish.

14:40.164 --> 14:41.798
<i>Yes!</i>

14:45.002 --> 14:47.604
Four in a row,
completely undefeated.

14:47.605 --> 14:50.106
I don't know what the
is wrong with these guys.

14:50.107 --> 14:51.775
If I was on the guys' team
right now,

14:51.776 --> 14:54.177
I'd be begging
for a sex change.

14:54.178 --> 14:55.845
Ladies, well done.

14:55.846 --> 14:58.848
<i>Thank you, chef.
You nailed it.</i>

14:58.849 --> 15:03.553
I hope you're in the mood
for something truly spectacular.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.488
You are gonna experience
an amazing

15:05.489 --> 15:07.590
day of fun in the sun

15:07.591 --> 15:10.627
at your gorgeous beach house
in Malibu.

15:13.230 --> 15:14.597
Malibu, bitch!

15:14.598 --> 15:16.399
Whoo!

15:16.400 --> 15:21.037
We have rented a $15
million mansion.

15:21.038 --> 15:23.807
You're gonna be joined
by some very special guests.

15:23.808 --> 15:25.875
<i>Ooh.
Hurry up.</i>

15:25.876 --> 15:28.678
Your chauffeured convertibles
are waiting for you.

15:30.514 --> 15:32.148
Off you go!
Come on.

15:32.149 --> 15:34.818
Malibu Barbies!
Thank you, chef.

15:34.819 --> 15:36.886
Good job, guys.
That was awesome.

15:36.887 --> 15:39.489
Yeah, good job!

15:39.490 --> 15:41.758
Men, you didn't just get beat.

15:41.759 --> 15:44.094
<i>You got smoked.</i>

15:44.095 --> 15:47.063
You are in for a grueling day
of physical,

15:47.064 --> 15:48.865
and I mean physical, labor.

15:48.866 --> 15:50.400
I'm gonna throw up.

15:50.401 --> 15:53.470
You'll be making bread
from scratch.

15:53.471 --> 15:55.605
<i>You'll start by carrying in</i>

15:55.606 --> 15:58.241
the deliveries of wheat flour.

15:58.242 --> 16:00.377
Then you'll grind that flour,
by hand,

16:00.378 --> 16:03.913
to perfect our bread.

16:03.914 --> 16:06.149
I am tired of losing
and being punished.

16:06.150 --> 16:07.317
I wanna be on the beach.

16:07.318 --> 16:08.518
I like getting
Doug E. Fresh.

16:08.519 --> 16:09.552
Come on, guys.

16:09.553 --> 16:10.820
You haven't got all day.

16:10.821 --> 16:12.889
Load me up.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.858
Malibu! Malibu! Malibu!

16:14.859 --> 16:16.593
Here they come.

16:16.594 --> 16:17.994
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

16:17.995 --> 16:19.696
Come on, come on, come on.
Move, move, move.

16:19.697 --> 16:21.331
Move! Move out the way!

16:21.332 --> 16:22.699
Damn!

16:22.700 --> 16:25.402
Just shut up and let us finish.

16:25.403 --> 16:26.569
Malibu! Malibu! Malibu!

16:26.570 --> 16:28.071
I'm getting tired
of their mouths.

16:28.072 --> 16:30.640
"Bye, boys.
Have a good one."

16:30.641 --> 16:33.510
I hope those convertibles
flip over, I do.

16:35.146 --> 16:38.748
Nice!
I want the white one.

16:38.749 --> 16:40.250
Let me get with
the skinny bitches.

16:41.352 --> 16:43.586
Scoot over.
Oh, my God, ladies.

16:43.587 --> 16:45.789
<i>We gotta strap
those babies in.</i>

16:45.790 --> 16:47.857
We don't want them
flopping in the wind.

16:47.858 --> 16:50.860
Malibu, Malibu, Malibu!

16:52.463 --> 16:55.398
See those mortar and pestles?

16:55.399 --> 16:58.468
<i>Get the wheat on there
and start grinding away.</i>

16:58.469 --> 17:00.103
<i>We need powder.</i>

17:02.440 --> 17:04.307
Let the weight of the rock
do your work, all right?

17:04.308 --> 17:05.474
I feel like a caveman.

17:05.476 --> 17:07.042
Ray, is this what
making bread was like

17:07.044 --> 17:08.845
when you were a kid?
Yeah.

17:10.580 --> 17:13.450
I'm sweating
like already.

17:13.451 --> 17:15.151
This sucks. I hate it.

17:15.152 --> 17:17.119
I wanna be in Malibu right now.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.127
We're definitely turning heads,

17:25.128 --> 17:26.628
driving up PCH.

17:26.630 --> 17:29.732
People definitely
saw eight hot chicks

17:29.733 --> 17:31.668
in three hot convertibles,

17:31.669 --> 17:33.970
and they were honking
all the way up.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.875
<i>We in Malibu!</i>

17:42.580 --> 17:45.582
Oh, my God!

17:45.583 --> 17:47.951
Oh, my God!

17:47.952 --> 17:50.286
O-M-G.

17:50.287 --> 17:52.322
This house is huge.

17:52.323 --> 17:53.590
It's absolutely huge.

17:53.591 --> 17:56.226
Holy...
Holy .

17:56.227 --> 17:57.694
<i>Look at this view.</i>

17:57.695 --> 17:59.529
This is out of control.

17:59.530 --> 18:00.697
I can see straight through,

18:00.698 --> 18:02.298
all the way down to the ocean.

18:02.299 --> 18:03.500
Amazing.

18:03.501 --> 18:06.002
Oh, my God.

18:06.003 --> 18:07.604
Let's cheer for another win
for the red team.

18:10.975 --> 18:13.910
While the women
toast to another victory,

18:13.911 --> 18:16.613
the men try to grind out
another punishment.

18:16.614 --> 18:19.582
This learn-how-to-make-bread
bonding is .

18:19.583 --> 18:23.286
I've made bread before,
but not like this.

18:23.287 --> 18:25.355
We have to mill everything
by hand.

18:25.356 --> 18:27.724
I've never done anything
so hard in my life.

18:29.927 --> 18:31.661
I'm never gonna
burn bread again.

18:31.662 --> 18:33.830
Oh, my God.

18:33.831 --> 18:35.098
I'm just too old
for this .

18:35.099 --> 18:37.233
Ahh.

18:37.234 --> 18:38.635
I'm not happy anymore.

18:38.636 --> 18:40.770
While the men
labor over the bread,

18:40.771 --> 18:42.906
the women are ready
to do some baking

18:42.907 --> 18:44.007
in the Malibu sun...

18:44.008 --> 18:45.708
Who's coming to see us?

18:45.709 --> 18:47.944
When they're surprised
by some very special guests.

18:47.945 --> 18:49.779
Oh, my God.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.047
Hi!
Hi, you guys.

18:51.048 --> 18:52.549
Hi! How are you?

18:52.550 --> 18:54.317
I'm Laird.
And I'm Gabi.

18:54.318 --> 18:55.618
From our left comes

18:55.619 --> 18:57.487
Laird Hamilton
and Gabrielle Reece.

18:57.488 --> 18:59.222
They are the king and queen
of the beach,

18:59.223 --> 19:01.224
so this is really, really cool.

19:01.225 --> 19:03.459
We happen to be sent here
by chef Ramsay,

19:03.460 --> 19:04.627
not only to congratulate you,

19:04.628 --> 19:05.762
but show you, sort of,

19:05.763 --> 19:07.096
some of the things
we love to do.

19:07.097 --> 19:09.098
Who wants to go in the ocean
with me first?

19:09.099 --> 19:11.601
It's called stand up paddling.
I do!

19:11.602 --> 19:12.802
I'll take off my shirt.

19:15.105 --> 19:17.574
Whoa. Holla, holla,
holla, holla.

19:17.575 --> 19:20.276
Please come save me, boo.

19:20.277 --> 19:21.744
Come rescue me.

19:21.745 --> 19:24.547
<i>I feel like I'm on Baywatch.</i>

19:25.883 --> 19:29.219
All right, Jessica.
Whoo!

19:29.220 --> 19:31.521
<i>Look at them,
they're doing so good.</i>

19:31.522 --> 19:32.855
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

19:32.856 --> 19:34.324
Paddle boarding's pretty easy

19:34.325 --> 19:37.760
until you try and stand up.

19:37.761 --> 19:39.128
Don't fall, Susan!

19:39.129 --> 19:40.163
Stay on the board!

19:40.164 --> 19:42.098
Don't fall.

19:48.205 --> 19:50.807
Speed is your friend.

19:50.808 --> 19:52.175
Come on, Cyndi, you can do it!

19:52.176 --> 19:55.011
<i>Let's go, Cyn!</i>

19:56.780 --> 19:58.615
Cyndi was the best.

19:58.616 --> 20:00.850
She couldn't kneel.
She couldn't stand.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.986
She kept falling off.

20:02.987 --> 20:05.755
She looked like
a baby on a raft.

20:07.524 --> 20:09.826
That was a lot of fun.
Makes you feel alive again.

20:09.827 --> 20:11.661
That's good.
I got it.

20:16.834 --> 20:18.868
that flour.

20:22.806 --> 20:24.774
You all right, dude?

20:26.043 --> 20:27.110
You all right?
Jeremy, what's the matter?

20:27.111 --> 20:28.878
Jeremy?

20:28.879 --> 20:30.146
<i>Jeremy?</i>

20:30.147 --> 20:31.581
I need the medical aid
really bad.

20:31.582 --> 20:34.751
Where's the medic?
You know where the medic is?

20:34.752 --> 20:36.753
<i>Ugh.
Medic!</i>

20:44.261 --> 20:46.796
After losing their
fourth consecutive challenge,

20:46.797 --> 20:49.065
the men's
grueling punishment...

20:50.334 --> 20:51.701
You all right, dude?

20:51.702 --> 20:54.837
Is proving
too much for Jeremy.

20:54.838 --> 20:56.372
I need the medical aid
really bad.

20:56.373 --> 20:58.608
Where's the medic?
You know where the medic is?

20:58.609 --> 21:00.309
I just hear...

21:00.310 --> 21:02.845
And I see Jeremy
laying on the counter.

21:02.846 --> 21:04.213
I don't know
what's going on right now.

21:04.214 --> 21:06.048
Come on, come on.

21:06.049 --> 21:07.650
<i>All right.
He's coming, he's coming.</i>

21:07.651 --> 21:09.018
Here, Jeremy, take a water.

21:09.019 --> 21:11.420
Here, medic's here.
What happened?

21:11.421 --> 21:12.588
I'm getting really dizzy
and overheated.

21:12.589 --> 21:14.457
And I'm getting
a really bad headache.

21:14.458 --> 21:15.892
All right. Sit back.

21:15.893 --> 21:18.528
Has this happened before?
I'm an ex-stroke patient.

21:18.529 --> 21:22.231
Okay. My head is really
starting to pound.

21:22.232 --> 21:24.133
Now I feel like
a complete because

21:24.134 --> 21:25.868
I'm one of the biggest reasons

21:25.869 --> 21:27.336
why he was grinding this flour.

21:27.337 --> 21:28.838
It would kill me,
more than anything,

21:28.839 --> 21:31.674
if you, like, died right now.

21:36.613 --> 21:39.115
We're gonna have to take you
to the emergency room.

21:39.116 --> 21:40.716
<i>Jeremy, you all right?</i>

21:40.717 --> 21:41.817
I'm scared that this could lead

21:41.818 --> 21:43.052
to me having another stroke.

21:43.053 --> 21:44.554
I might not be coming back

21:44.555 --> 21:45.922
to Hell's Kitchen
because of this.

21:45.923 --> 21:48.925
I wanna win,
but I don't wanna die.

21:48.926 --> 21:50.092
I hope Jeremy's all right.

21:50.093 --> 21:52.061
I hope he's all right too.

21:53.564 --> 21:55.698
Oh, boy. Get ready, gentlemen.
Here they come.

21:55.699 --> 21:57.099
Don't even acknowledge 'em.

21:57.100 --> 21:59.101
Hey!
How's it going?

22:02.206 --> 22:04.106
<i>Come on, bitches, smile.</i>

22:04.107 --> 22:06.008
Hey!

22:06.009 --> 22:08.044
Keep working, boys.
Awesome.

22:08.045 --> 22:09.679
That just... pfft.

22:15.118 --> 22:17.119
Let's get back to work,
shall we?

22:17.120 --> 22:18.221
Welcome back, dude.

22:18.222 --> 22:19.488
Yep.

22:19.489 --> 22:21.224
<i>Hey, nice.
Sorry about that, chef.</i>

22:21.225 --> 22:22.892
How you feeling, sir?

22:22.893 --> 22:24.126
What's going on?
What was the matter?

22:24.127 --> 22:26.162
I just wasn't eating.

22:26.163 --> 22:27.597
You what?
He wasn't eating.

22:27.598 --> 22:30.233
The doctor said
I wasn't eating enough.

22:30.234 --> 22:31.434
She said that
I needed to eat more.

22:32.936 --> 22:34.570
Is there anything I can help you with?
We got this, Jeremy.

22:34.571 --> 22:36.138
Yeah, we're almost done.
Yeah, we're cool, Jeremy.

22:36.139 --> 22:38.341
I'm sorry, guys.
Don't... Just go, go, go, man.

22:38.342 --> 22:40.476
No worries.
Go relax.

22:42.145 --> 22:43.546
Doctor said
he needs to eat more.

22:43.547 --> 22:44.914
I think he needs
a second opinion.

22:46.283 --> 22:47.350
That's funny.

22:49.386 --> 22:50.653
What's up?

22:50.654 --> 22:52.555
Are you done?

22:52.556 --> 22:54.523
Uh, no. I just got back
from the hospital.

22:54.524 --> 22:56.058
What happened?

22:56.059 --> 22:58.261
I wasn't eating.

22:58.262 --> 23:00.496
What?
Bitch, you done ate us

23:00.497 --> 23:02.665
out of house and home
these last three days.

23:02.666 --> 23:04.667
And you talking about
that you ain't ate?

23:04.668 --> 23:06.802
Let's see if there's
anything to eat.

23:08.005 --> 23:11.474
<i>I'm trying to eat
nothing but superfood.</i>

23:11.475 --> 23:12.742
Oh, hell yes.

23:12.743 --> 23:14.010
I can make fried chicken.

23:15.012 --> 23:16.779
I'm more hungry than ever.

23:16.780 --> 23:19.582
So once I eat something
and get some energy

23:19.583 --> 23:22.018
in the tummy, I'm ready to go.

23:25.689 --> 23:28.457
After a long, punishing day

23:28.458 --> 23:29.625
of prepping bread dough...

23:29.626 --> 23:31.160
<i>Did someone set that alarm?
Yep.</i>

23:31.161 --> 23:32.762
The rest of the blue team

23:32.763 --> 23:35.598
joins Jeremy in getting
some much-needed sleep.

23:35.599 --> 23:37.767
Oh, my God.

23:37.768 --> 23:40.202
But prepping the dough
was only half the punishment.

23:40.203 --> 23:42.571
That's the worst alarm
I've ever heard in my life.

23:42.572 --> 23:44.807
The other
half is baking it.

23:46.610 --> 23:48.844
Oh, God.
4:00 in the morning...

23:48.845 --> 23:50.613
the roosters
aren't even up yet.

23:50.614 --> 23:52.581
I'm normally
in my third dream by now.

23:52.582 --> 23:53.716
Unbelievable.

23:56.486 --> 23:57.753
How you feeling today, Jeremy?

23:57.754 --> 23:59.255
I'm all right, chef.

23:59.256 --> 24:01.324
I actually don't feel hungry.

24:01.325 --> 24:03.459
<i>I just wanna
go back to bed.</i>

24:03.460 --> 24:06.095
If I get two hours of sleep,
I'll be happy.

24:06.096 --> 24:07.363
Those are good.

24:07.364 --> 24:08.964
<i>All right, you can go.</i>

24:08.965 --> 24:10.366
Now that the bread has risen,

24:10.367 --> 24:13.402
the men are lying down
for a little more sleep.

24:15.172 --> 24:16.939
Unfortunately, chef Ramsay

24:16.940 --> 24:18.741
has other plans for them.

24:21.978 --> 24:23.346
Can nobody answer the phone?

24:24.715 --> 24:26.148
Hello?

24:26.149 --> 24:27.917
Hello, good morning.
Can you get the red team

24:27.918 --> 24:30.553
and the blue team
down immediately, please?

24:30.554 --> 24:31.554
Absolutely, chef.

24:31.555 --> 24:32.555
Thank you.

24:32.556 --> 24:34.757
Guys, wake up.

24:34.758 --> 24:36.425
Chef wants us downstairs
right away.

24:36.426 --> 24:37.693
If chef Ramsay calls the dorm,

24:37.694 --> 24:40.229
you better move like
you got a match up your ,

24:40.230 --> 24:41.464
because something's going down.

24:41.465 --> 24:43.165
Man, finally.

24:43.166 --> 24:45.267
Line up. What is going on
up there?

24:45.268 --> 24:46.936
It is way too early for this.

24:46.937 --> 24:50.272
I am nowhere near ready.

24:50.273 --> 24:52.708
Right. Good morning.
Good morning, chef.

24:52.709 --> 24:56.011
As chefs, we are required
to work long hours, yeah?

24:56.012 --> 24:57.413
Yes, chef.

24:57.414 --> 24:58.547
You know,
there's another profession

24:58.548 --> 25:01.016
who sacrifice their time
and work long hours.

25:01.017 --> 25:05.087
Today I've invited these
special guests to Hell's Kitchen

25:05.088 --> 25:07.490
for a unique breakfast
at the end of their shift.

25:07.491 --> 25:09.692
We will be feeding
emergency doctors,

25:09.693 --> 25:11.727
nurses, and EMTs.

25:11.728 --> 25:14.897
Dude, these guys
save lives 24/7,

25:14.898 --> 25:16.365
hardly never a break.

25:16.366 --> 25:18.467
We gotta treat these guys
with the utmost respect.

25:18.468 --> 25:20.903
I've never done this before.

25:20.904 --> 25:22.138
I'd like you to treat this

25:22.139 --> 25:24.740
as if it was a dinner service.

25:24.741 --> 25:27.877
The first to finish wins.

25:27.878 --> 25:29.945
The losing team,

25:29.946 --> 25:32.047
someone is going to be
going home.

25:32.048 --> 25:33.282
Ooh.

25:35.252 --> 25:37.386
Not gonna be me,
that's for sure.

25:37.387 --> 25:38.988
I'm gonna pull my team
through this,

25:38.989 --> 25:40.322
and we're gonna
beat this challenge,

25:40.323 --> 25:41.524
no matter what.

25:41.525 --> 25:43.259
Into the kitchen, let's go.

25:43.260 --> 25:46.295
Each team has 15 minutes

25:46.296 --> 25:47.897
to get up to speed
on the breakfast menu...

25:47.898 --> 25:48.998
These are the dishes.

25:48.999 --> 25:50.566
Make sure you guys
study the sample plates.

25:50.567 --> 25:52.868
Which includes a
croissant breakfast sandwich,

25:52.869 --> 25:55.938
traditional eggs Benedict,
a classic omelet,

25:55.939 --> 25:57.573
blueberry and banana pancakes,

25:57.574 --> 25:59.909
and smoked salmon
with scrambled eggs.

25:59.910 --> 26:01.143
This takes the least
amount of time,

26:01.144 --> 26:02.278
and this takes
the least amount of time.

26:02.279 --> 26:03.512
So this one fires this one.

26:03.513 --> 26:04.914
The team that serves

26:04.915 --> 26:07.750
their emergency
medical workers first wins.

26:07.751 --> 26:09.752
Omelet?
The salmon as well, yes.

26:09.753 --> 26:11.253
And a salmon as well?
Of course.

26:11.254 --> 26:13.689
Ladies, it's early,
but let's talk.

26:13.690 --> 26:15.391
Oh, .

26:15.392 --> 26:16.392
Let's go, guys.
Come on, we can do it.

26:16.393 --> 26:17.760
Blue team, here we go.

26:17.761 --> 26:19.895
Dining room is full
of extraordinary workers.

26:19.896 --> 26:20.930
Give them something back.

26:20.931 --> 26:21.931
Yes, chef. Let's go.

26:21.932 --> 26:23.432
On order... six covers,
table 20.

26:23.433 --> 26:25.201
Three omelet, two smoked salmon,
one croissant.

26:25.202 --> 26:26.469
Yes, chef.

26:26.470 --> 26:28.337
Fire food, boys.
Just keep firing food.

26:28.338 --> 26:30.339
Don't rush yourself.
Talk before you walk.

26:30.340 --> 26:32.007
Dan, set them plates up,
brother.

26:32.008 --> 26:34.944
me to tears, really?

26:34.945 --> 26:36.645
Pans are too small, man.

26:36.646 --> 26:40.015
Ray, Ray, Ray, stop!
Stop!

26:40.016 --> 26:41.884
Chef, I need a bigger pan.
Come on!

26:41.885 --> 26:43.886
Do you have any
big teflon pans over there?

26:43.887 --> 26:45.554
Oh, love you.

26:45.555 --> 26:46.989
While Ray is having trouble

26:46.990 --> 26:48.390
keeping his eggs in the pan,

26:48.391 --> 26:50.526
over on the red side...

26:50.527 --> 26:51.660
Six covers, table 30.

26:51.661 --> 26:52.695
Three omelet, two smoked salmon,
one pancake.

26:52.696 --> 26:53.696
Yes, chef.

26:53.697 --> 26:54.797
Cyndi...

26:54.798 --> 26:56.198
These are sticking
in this pan.

26:56.199 --> 26:57.933
Is having
trouble getting her eggs

26:57.934 --> 26:58.934
out of the pan.

26:58.935 --> 27:00.002
I need to start over.

27:00.003 --> 27:01.737
We cannot fall behind
right now.

27:01.738 --> 27:03.172
I mean, we need to come out
of the gate really well.

27:03.173 --> 27:04.673
And we need
to keep the momentum going.

27:04.674 --> 27:06.275
<i>How long?
Two minutes, chef.</i>

27:06.276 --> 27:07.910
Can you wake up a little bit?

27:07.911 --> 27:08.911
Yes, chef.

27:08.912 --> 27:10.579
Let's go.

27:10.580 --> 27:12.448
As Cyndi starts
over on her omelet...

27:12.449 --> 27:13.649
That's just sticking, babe.

27:13.650 --> 27:14.683
Just... just toss it.

27:14.684 --> 27:15.851
In the blue kitchen...

27:15.852 --> 27:17.319
Come on, guys,
let's keep pushing.

27:17.320 --> 27:19.889
The men are almost
ready with their first order.

27:19.890 --> 27:21.957
Three omelet, two smoked salmon,
one croissant.

27:21.958 --> 27:24.927
<i>How long?
30 seconds on that, please.</i>

27:24.928 --> 27:27.530
Jeremy, hey, hey...
He's not even answering me.

27:27.531 --> 27:28.898
<i>Come on, Jeremy.</i>

27:28.899 --> 27:30.132
Can I get an answer from you?

27:30.133 --> 27:31.233
Yes, you can.

27:31.234 --> 27:32.368
What was that callback?

27:32.369 --> 27:33.602
I wasn't able to hear it, chef.

27:33.603 --> 27:34.937
Oh, me.

27:34.938 --> 27:37.373
Jeremy is dead weight,
plain and simple.

27:37.374 --> 27:39.008
I mean, he's going back
to the person

27:39.009 --> 27:41.877
we put up for elimination
the very first service.

27:41.878 --> 27:43.579
Two smoked salmon...
30 seconds, yes?

27:43.580 --> 27:46.615
Are you guys walking
with the omelets?

27:46.616 --> 27:49.351
<i>Jeremy, are they all coming?
Communicate!</i>

27:49.352 --> 27:50.452
I'm... that's what
I'm waiting on.

27:50.453 --> 27:51.453
Are you guys walking
with the omelets?

27:51.454 --> 27:53.589
30 seconds, please.

27:53.590 --> 27:56.825
How much longer
on your guys' Benedict?

27:56.826 --> 27:58.594
Start prepping more,
get more ready.

27:58.595 --> 28:01.130
He's just like,
"Duh..."

28:01.131 --> 28:02.598
I'll do it.
Give me it.

28:02.599 --> 28:04.099
Jeremy's standing in the middle
there like that

28:04.100 --> 28:05.334
with his breakfast.

28:05.335 --> 28:07.102
<i>Jeremy, walk.</i>

28:07.103 --> 28:08.737
Come around then, big boy.

28:10.240 --> 28:13.008
So where's the smoked salmon
scrambled eggs?

28:13.009 --> 28:15.878
Get over there and help plate
a smoked salmon.

28:15.879 --> 28:17.346
Salmon... I'm gonna walk.

28:17.347 --> 28:18.714
Do you have a plate
ready to walk?

28:18.715 --> 28:20.115
No. Almost done.

28:20.116 --> 28:21.817
<i>Can I walk this plate?
No!</i>

28:21.818 --> 28:23.485
<i>I got six smoked salmon.
Hurry up! They're dying!</i>

28:23.486 --> 28:25.254
<i>Come on! Watch your back.
Watch your back.</i>

28:25.255 --> 28:26.722
Come on.
I'm coming down.

28:28.792 --> 28:30.926
<i>Hey, all
of you, come here.</i>

28:30.927 --> 28:32.394
All of you!
I'm listening, chef.

28:32.395 --> 28:34.697
Yes, chef?
Some disgusting pig

28:34.698 --> 28:37.099
brought me
the sample scrambled eggs.

28:39.169 --> 28:42.905
The sample scrambled eggs
that I cooked an hour ago.

28:42.906 --> 28:45.174
Make sure you guys
study the sample plates.

28:45.175 --> 28:49.745
These guests, they save lives
on a daily basis,

28:49.746 --> 28:51.146
and you wanna serve that?

28:51.147 --> 28:54.450
Jeremy, Dan, you'll
kill someone with that!

29:00.089 --> 29:01.923
It's early morning,

29:01.924 --> 29:03.258
and Hell's Kitchen
has opened its doors

29:03.259 --> 29:05.260
to serve breakfast to a group
of much-deserving

29:05.261 --> 29:07.763
doctors, nurses, and EMTs.

29:07.764 --> 29:09.931
But one member
of the blue team...

29:09.932 --> 29:13.302
Some disgusting pig brought me
the sample scrambled eggs.

29:13.303 --> 29:16.104
Has delivered
the wrong dish.

29:16.105 --> 29:18.006
You picked that up.

29:18.007 --> 29:19.708
<i>Take that garnish back.</i>

29:19.709 --> 29:20.976
<i>Work it
again, let's go.</i>

29:20.977 --> 29:22.044
off, guys.

29:22.045 --> 29:23.545
Just pay attention.

29:23.546 --> 29:25.547
Jeremy should have
been able to look at that

29:25.548 --> 29:26.915
and go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:26.916 --> 29:28.450
"That looks like
it's really old.

29:28.451 --> 29:29.851
This must not
be the plate."

29:29.852 --> 29:31.887
Find me a rubber spatula,
please.

29:31.888 --> 29:34.122
Jeremy really the bed
on this one, man.

29:34.123 --> 29:35.424
Jeremy, go run and find
a rubber spatula

29:35.425 --> 29:36.758
in the back, please.

29:36.759 --> 29:39.661
With Jeremy
out of the kitchen,

29:39.662 --> 29:41.296
the rest of the blue team
comes together

29:41.297 --> 29:42.731
to complete their first order.

29:42.732 --> 29:44.666
These are good.
Very good.

29:44.667 --> 29:46.702
Meanwhile,
back in the red kitchen...

29:46.703 --> 29:48.070
<i>Coming behind, behind, behind.</i>

29:48.071 --> 29:49.805
Let's go, garnish.

29:49.806 --> 29:51.973
Ja'nel and
Cyndi are finally

29:51.974 --> 29:53.675
finding their groove.

29:53.676 --> 29:55.010
They got great finesse,
do you know what I mean?

29:55.011 --> 29:56.311
<i>Everything looks
beautiful in here.</i>

29:56.312 --> 29:58.714
Ja'nel, that scrambled egg
is delicious.

29:58.715 --> 30:00.816
Thank you, chef.
Thank you.

30:00.817 --> 30:02.784
But with orders
coming in fast and furious...

30:02.785 --> 30:04.486
Next table...
four covers, table 43.

30:04.487 --> 30:06.621
Two eggs Benedict, two omelet.

30:06.622 --> 30:08.056
I'm ready on the omelets.

30:08.057 --> 30:09.624
It appears that one chef...

30:09.625 --> 30:10.926
Nedra!

30:10.927 --> 30:13.061
Wakey, wakey! Let's go!
Yes, chef.

30:13.062 --> 30:15.530
May be
sleepwalking through service.

30:15.531 --> 30:18.133
What goes first, the ham?

30:18.134 --> 30:21.670
Oh, my gosh.
I hate the morning time.

30:21.671 --> 30:22.838
I'm discombobulated,

30:22.839 --> 30:24.406
but I'm happy I got a bra on.

30:24.407 --> 30:26.575
I need one eggs Benedict,
urgently.

30:26.576 --> 30:28.710
Why haven't you
got two plating?

30:28.711 --> 30:30.479
You jump right out of the bed,

30:30.480 --> 30:32.114
and you're cooking for

30:32.115 --> 30:35.317
doctors, nurse, um, ERs,

30:35.318 --> 30:37.486
um, some of everybody.

30:37.487 --> 30:38.854
So it's like .

30:38.855 --> 30:39.855
Are you ready, Nedra?

30:39.856 --> 30:42.023
I need another minute on eggs.

30:42.024 --> 30:43.658
Hey, hello.

30:43.659 --> 30:45.460
I'm coming right now, chef.

30:45.461 --> 30:47.229
Stop, Nedra.
Stop, stop, stop.

30:47.230 --> 30:48.296
<i>Stop!</i>

30:48.297 --> 30:50.465
Ladies!

30:50.466 --> 30:52.134
Look, soggy.

30:52.135 --> 30:53.735
Why are you using
the soggy ones

30:53.736 --> 30:55.837
when you got
toasted behind you?

30:55.838 --> 30:57.572
Yes, chef.
No, not, "Yes, chef."

30:57.573 --> 30:58.940
Why are you
using the soggy ones?

30:58.941 --> 31:00.742
I didn't know
they was soggy, chef.

31:00.743 --> 31:02.344
Visually, you don't know
that's not toasted?

31:02.345 --> 31:04.079
I didn't see it
when it went down, chef,

31:04.080 --> 31:06.581
<i>but I got another one coming.</i>

31:06.582 --> 31:08.183
<i>Let's go, guys.
Let's bounce back.</i>

31:08.184 --> 31:09.618
Someone help her.

31:09.619 --> 31:11.019
<i>I need help. What do you need?
Talk to me.</i>

31:11.020 --> 31:13.555
I'm worried that Nedra's
gonna break the team down.

31:13.556 --> 31:14.923
Stop smashing that.

31:14.924 --> 31:16.925
<i>No, stop smashing
the egg.</i>

31:16.926 --> 31:18.427
Oh, you killing me.

31:18.428 --> 31:20.128
You're killing me.
I know.

31:20.129 --> 31:21.730
Before I knew it,

31:21.731 --> 31:23.665
I'm having to do
everything for Nedra.

31:23.666 --> 31:25.133
Want me to do sauce?
Bacon, bacon.

31:25.134 --> 31:27.836
Where's your sauce?
Where's your sauce?

31:27.837 --> 31:29.838
Send that up.
Walking with the eggs Benedict.

31:29.839 --> 31:31.039
Beautiful.
Let's go.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.674
<i>Go, go, go. Come on.</i>

31:32.675 --> 31:33.742
I'll take care of this stuff.

31:33.743 --> 31:34.876
Thanks to Amanda...

31:34.877 --> 31:36.511
Go.
Red diners

31:36.512 --> 31:38.013
are enjoying their breakfast.

31:38.014 --> 31:39.581
They did a good job.

31:39.582 --> 31:42.083
But back
in the blue kitchen...

31:42.084 --> 31:43.518
You got my salmon plates, Dan?

31:43.519 --> 31:45.520
Ray is scrambling
to keep up the momentum

31:45.521 --> 31:47.789
and get his eggs to the pass.

31:47.790 --> 31:49.758
Salmon, chef.

31:51.594 --> 31:53.428
All of you, come here.

31:53.429 --> 31:54.830
Taste that.

31:54.831 --> 31:56.431
I want you to taste
that scrambled egg!

31:56.432 --> 31:59.367
<i>Taste it!</i>

31:59.368 --> 32:00.535
Some seasoning, guys...

32:00.536 --> 32:01.803
<i>a little salt and pepper.</i>

32:01.804 --> 32:04.039
Who made that?

32:04.040 --> 32:05.173
I did, chef.

32:05.174 --> 32:08.143
I put salt and pepper in it, chef.
You...

32:08.144 --> 32:09.778
<i>I mean, seriously?</i>

32:09.779 --> 32:11.346
They're paramedics!
I-I got 'em, chef.

32:11.347 --> 32:14.149
I think you need
a doctor right now!

32:14.150 --> 32:15.917
Two more salmon,
coming right up.

32:15.918 --> 32:18.520
While Ray
starts over on his eggs...

32:18.521 --> 32:19.788
Come on, chef Ray, come on.
You got it, buddy.

32:19.789 --> 32:21.089
In the red kitchen...

32:21.090 --> 32:22.891
Behind you, Benedict walking.

32:22.892 --> 32:24.359
With Amanda driving...

32:24.360 --> 32:25.560
Come on, guys.

32:25.561 --> 32:26.928
The women manage to serve

32:26.929 --> 32:28.997
well over half their diners...

32:30.867 --> 32:32.834
And are racing
towards the finish line.

32:32.835 --> 32:34.269
Two on 32.
Two on table 40.

32:34.270 --> 32:35.770
Two smoked salmon,
two pancakes!

32:35.771 --> 32:36.972
Yes, chef.

32:36.973 --> 32:38.974
I need three minutes
on pancakes.

32:38.975 --> 32:41.676
Making pancakes is pretty easy.

32:41.677 --> 32:44.045
I mean, who could
mess that up?

32:45.781 --> 32:48.083
I messed up that one.

32:48.084 --> 32:49.985
Two smoked salmon, two pancake,
how long?

32:49.986 --> 32:51.186
Five minutes, chef.

32:51.187 --> 32:52.354
Jacqueline?
Yes, chef?

32:52.355 --> 32:53.555
It's a breakfast.
Come on.

32:53.556 --> 32:55.156
Yes, chef.

32:55.157 --> 32:57.592
What you need, Jacqueline?
I just gotta wait for these to cook, baby.

32:57.593 --> 32:59.094
I'm feeling like
we need to

32:59.095 --> 33:00.495
get our together
right now,

33:00.496 --> 33:02.230
because if we lose
this morning,

33:02.231 --> 33:03.431
I got a chance of going home.

33:03.432 --> 33:05.033
I'ma put the blueberries.

33:05.034 --> 33:06.601
What are you using to flip?

33:06.602 --> 33:09.538
I'm just using that.
It's melting.

33:09.539 --> 33:11.740
You can't flip a pancake
with a rubber spatula,

33:11.741 --> 33:13.074
like, you can't.

33:13.075 --> 33:14.843
Jacqueline, flip this one.
I can't flip.

33:14.844 --> 33:16.511
How the
can I flip a pancake

33:16.512 --> 33:18.046
with no spatula?

33:18.047 --> 33:20.649
What, I'm supposed to flip it
with the bottom of my toes?

33:20.650 --> 33:23.485
Jacqueline, flip this one.
It's ready.

33:23.486 --> 33:24.986
Coming behind, behind.

33:24.987 --> 33:27.689
One pancake, two pancake,
right now.

33:27.690 --> 33:29.758
Two pancakes, two omelet,
followed by two more pancakes.

33:29.759 --> 33:30.859
Yes, chef.

33:30.860 --> 33:32.827
As Nedra steps in

33:32.828 --> 33:34.496
to get the red team
back on track...

33:34.497 --> 33:35.730
Let me put this
right on the fire.

33:35.731 --> 33:37.332
Over in the blue kitchen...

33:37.333 --> 33:39.367
Ray correctly salts his eggs.

33:39.368 --> 33:40.368
Raymond?
Yes, chef?

33:40.369 --> 33:42.504
Fluffy, delicious.
Yes, chef!

33:42.505 --> 33:44.005
And is
peppered with compliments.

33:44.006 --> 33:45.373
Every one, like that.

33:45.374 --> 33:46.374
Yeah, you got it, chef.

33:46.375 --> 33:47.375
And both teams

33:47.376 --> 33:50.145
are getting closer
to completion.

33:50.146 --> 33:51.479
You got three tickets left.

33:51.480 --> 33:52.881
The red team
has got two tickets left.

33:52.882 --> 33:54.249
<i>So speed up.
Hustle, come on! Hustle!</i>

33:54.250 --> 33:56.618
Oh, my God. So it's
coming down to the wire,

33:56.619 --> 33:57.852
and all systems are go.

33:57.853 --> 33:59.888
Let's get the
tickets out.

33:59.889 --> 34:01.489
Red team, you've got
two tickets left.

34:01.490 --> 34:03.325
The blue team has got
three tickets left. Come on!

34:03.326 --> 34:04.659
Yes, chef! Let's go, guys!

34:04.660 --> 34:05.760
<i>Come on, ladies.
Pick it up.</i>

34:05.761 --> 34:07.829
We need two pancakes
right now, next order.

34:07.830 --> 34:10.264
It's too hot. It burns 'em.
The pan's too hot, Jackie.

34:10.266 --> 34:11.533
Omelet's up.

34:11.534 --> 34:12.701
<i>We're waiting on two pancakes.</i>

34:12.702 --> 34:14.835
Make sure they're perfect.

34:16.405 --> 34:17.739
Go, go, go.
Come on.

34:17.739 --> 34:18.840
Piece of cake, dude.

34:18.841 --> 34:20.007
It's pancakes,
all right?

34:20.009 --> 34:21.710
Let's go!
Four pancakes, two omelets!

34:21.710 --> 34:24.112
Let's go!
Two tickets left, let's go!

34:24.112 --> 34:26.648
Too dark.

34:26.649 --> 34:28.516
Look at me.
Too dark.

34:28.516 --> 34:29.918
The race is on,

34:29.918 --> 34:31.353
and all we're dragging on
is pancakes.

34:31.353 --> 34:33.989
All hands on deck.
We need all hands on deck.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.757
Everybody on the red team
grabs a pan.

34:36.759 --> 34:38.426
Please don't let Fluffy,
delicious pancakes

34:38.427 --> 34:39.694
take us down this morning.

34:39.695 --> 34:41.228
We have one pancake ready
right here.

34:41.230 --> 34:43.598
Put it on this one.
Put it on this one.

34:43.599 --> 34:45.600
How many Bennys are up there?
We need four more, four going.

34:45.601 --> 34:47.101
The blue team's
digging deep right now.

34:47.103 --> 34:48.402
Sauce me, sauce me.

34:48.404 --> 34:50.005
Chef, we got to hurry!

34:50.005 --> 34:51.539
We all just wanna win so bad.

34:51.540 --> 34:53.007
We're gonna do
whatever it takes.

34:53.009 --> 34:55.377
Walk, walk, walk.

34:55.378 --> 34:56.678
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

34:56.679 --> 34:58.046
Walking behind.

34:58.047 --> 35:00.015
Where are the pancakes?
Right there, chef.

35:00.016 --> 35:02.283
Blueberries.

35:02.284 --> 35:03.551
Go. Go, go, go.

35:03.552 --> 35:05.720
Red team, one ticket each,
hurry up!

35:05.721 --> 35:06.755
Let's go, ladies!

35:06.756 --> 35:08.256
Get that pancake on now.

35:08.257 --> 35:11.159
Blue team, one ticket each, come on!
Come on!

35:11.160 --> 35:13.294
Everybody make a pancake!

35:13.295 --> 35:15.096
Walking, walking, walking.

35:15.097 --> 35:16.698
Let's go, guys!
Let's go!

35:16.699 --> 35:19.067
Fast! As fast as you've
ever worked in your life!

35:19.068 --> 35:21.269
If we get these pancakes up
in the next ten seconds,

35:21.270 --> 35:22.771
we're gonna win this challenge.

35:22.772 --> 35:24.272
<i>Guys, I have
one pancake ready.</i>

35:24.273 --> 35:26.675
Who's got the other?
Behind, behind, behind, behind, behind.

35:26.676 --> 35:29.644
Nedra, you're burning 'em,
baby, you're burning 'em.

35:29.645 --> 35:32.747
Where's the other pancake?

35:38.320 --> 35:39.854
It's coming down to the wire

35:39.855 --> 35:41.756
in this morning
breakfast service.

35:41.757 --> 35:43.658
Red team, one ticket each,
hurry up!

35:43.659 --> 35:45.260
We're not going home.
Let's go!

35:45.261 --> 35:46.361
Yo, I need you to hurry up.

35:46.362 --> 35:47.662
We need to beat the girls.

35:47.663 --> 35:49.130
The teams are neck and neck...

35:49.131 --> 35:51.466
Two more pancakes!
Fight for your life!

35:51.467 --> 35:53.835
And both
are desperate to win

35:53.836 --> 35:55.003
and avoid dropping
a team member.

35:55.004 --> 35:56.371
Please, guys, please hurry!

35:56.372 --> 35:57.939
Give me one more, gentlemen.

35:57.940 --> 36:00.909
This one ready, this one.
Flip that one.

36:00.910 --> 36:02.644
You're burning them!
Had you not burned them,

36:02.645 --> 36:03.778
you could have
completed the table.

36:03.779 --> 36:05.213
<i>Come on, Jackie!</i>

36:05.214 --> 36:06.548
Sauce, sauce, sauce.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

36:06.549 --> 36:08.049
I have one pancake ready
if you need it.

36:08.050 --> 36:09.317
Got it. Need it.

36:09.318 --> 36:11.586
Two smoked salmon, two Benedict.
Behind.

36:11.587 --> 36:13.221
<i>Good. Go.</i>

36:13.222 --> 36:14.956
Hold on.
Don't celebrate yet.

36:14.957 --> 36:16.758
The blue team
could actually win.

36:16.759 --> 36:17.826
This is amazing.

36:17.827 --> 36:20.929
<i>Two Benedict.</i>

36:20.930 --> 36:23.698
Go. Congratulations,
blue team, finally.

36:25.935 --> 36:27.202
Yeah, baby!

36:27.203 --> 36:29.070
We just lost.

36:29.071 --> 36:30.438
Yeah, baby!
Yeah, baby!

36:30.439 --> 36:31.639
I am so stoked right now.

36:31.640 --> 36:33.241
I mean, I-I was like,
"Yeah!"

36:33.242 --> 36:35.944
That's the way to do it,
Dan-o boy. Nice!

36:35.945 --> 36:40.181
I've never seen
such a disorganized

36:40.182 --> 36:43.284
pancake station
in all my life.

36:43.285 --> 36:46.855
How many pancakes
went in the trash?

36:48.891 --> 36:51.493
Way, way, way out of control.

36:51.494 --> 36:53.228
Ladies and gentlemen,

36:53.229 --> 36:55.029
first of all, I hope
you enjoyed your breakfast.

36:56.499 --> 36:57.999
<i>Great.
Thank you very much, indeed.</i>

36:58.000 --> 37:00.602
It's been a honor
to be given the chance

37:00.603 --> 37:02.604
to actually take care
of you guys for once.

37:02.605 --> 37:04.572
Thank you for joining us
this morning. God bless.

37:04.573 --> 37:06.641
Thank you.

37:08.244 --> 37:09.611
Ladies?

37:09.612 --> 37:10.678
Yes, chef?

37:10.679 --> 37:12.814
That was a disaster.

37:12.815 --> 37:16.785
Think about the individuals
you need to start losing

37:16.786 --> 37:18.319
to make your team stronger,

37:18.320 --> 37:21.356
and nominate two individuals
for elimination.

37:21.357 --> 37:24.159
Got it?
Yes, chef.

37:25.327 --> 37:26.828
It's not even 9:00 a.m.

37:26.829 --> 37:27.829
No one's had coffee.

37:27.830 --> 37:29.364
No one's brushed their hair.

37:29.365 --> 37:30.565
Some people
haven't brushed their teeth.

37:30.566 --> 37:32.600
And now we need
to send someone home.

37:32.601 --> 37:35.603
It's blowing my mind.

37:37.873 --> 37:39.107
This sucks, guys, I know,

37:39.108 --> 37:41.476
but it has to be
the two obvious choices

37:41.477 --> 37:43.711
of Jackie for her pancakes
and Nedra

37:43.712 --> 37:46.047
for that
whole Benedict station,

37:46.048 --> 37:47.482
otherwise we're gonna
look like we don't know

37:47.483 --> 37:49.450
what the we're doing.

37:49.451 --> 37:52.954
Jackie, sorry, babe.
I really am.

37:52.955 --> 37:55.456
Jackie just failed
to make pancakes.

37:55.457 --> 37:57.091
If we would've gotten
those pancakes

37:57.092 --> 37:59.360
perfectly cooked,
we would've killed the guys.

37:59.361 --> 38:01.763
And, uh, Nedra just because...

38:01.764 --> 38:03.698
I mean,
there's nothing we can do.

38:03.699 --> 38:06.568
He's gonna scream at us
if we don't.

38:07.803 --> 38:09.771
<i>I know I shouldn't go up.</i>

38:09.772 --> 38:11.339
He said,
"Pick the weakest one."

38:11.340 --> 38:12.907
I'm not the weakest one here.

38:12.908 --> 38:14.642
If you're not gonna go up,

38:14.643 --> 38:16.110
who's gonna go up
instead of you?

38:16.111 --> 38:17.846
Mary, Mary.

38:17.847 --> 38:20.815
She's weak.
All right. Thank you.

38:20.816 --> 38:22.317
I'm confused right now.

38:22.318 --> 38:23.518
I've worked really hard,

38:23.519 --> 38:25.220
and I don't think
I should be up there.

38:25.221 --> 38:27.755
Don't put me up, because
I pulled my weight today.

38:27.756 --> 38:29.991
Why are you nominating Mary

38:29.992 --> 38:33.194
when we had the issue today
with the eggs Benedict?

38:33.195 --> 38:35.163
One soggy piece of toast

38:35.164 --> 38:36.664
that I didn't put up?

38:36.665 --> 38:38.700
Many times,
when you bitches

38:38.701 --> 38:40.635
had me
dying back there,

38:40.636 --> 38:43.638
I'm the bitch who kept
the station going!

38:43.639 --> 38:45.607
So y'all if y'all
don't wanna save me!

38:45.608 --> 38:47.242
Now y'all save Mary!

38:47.243 --> 38:48.710
off!

38:48.711 --> 38:50.511
Oh, man.

38:50.512 --> 38:53.348
Are these the two people
we wanna lose?

38:53.349 --> 38:54.582
We need to decide right now.

38:54.583 --> 38:55.950
Are we basing it
on the weakest link,

38:55.951 --> 38:57.986
or are we basing it
on today's service?

39:11.533 --> 39:13.468
Cyndi.
Yes, chef?

39:13.469 --> 39:14.802
First nominee?

39:14.803 --> 39:16.638
Our first nominee
is Jacqueline, chef.

39:16.639 --> 39:18.940
<i>We're basing it off
of the performance</i>

39:18.941 --> 39:20.108
<i>on the pancake station, chef,</i>

39:20.109 --> 39:21.442
and the raw chicken
from the last...

39:21.443 --> 39:22.877
the dinner service, chef.

39:22.878 --> 39:25.780
Raw chicken,
from previous dinner service?

39:25.781 --> 39:27.415
Yes, chef.

39:27.416 --> 39:28.850
Okay.
Second nominee?

39:28.851 --> 39:32.253
Our second nominee, chef...

39:39.227 --> 39:41.528
After a meltdown
on the pancake station,

39:41.529 --> 39:43.497
the red team
lost breakfast service,

39:43.498 --> 39:44.498
and have nominated...

39:44.499 --> 39:46.400
Jacqueline, chef.

39:47.736 --> 39:49.003
Now they
must give chef Ramsay

39:49.004 --> 39:50.337
their second nominee.

39:50.338 --> 39:51.905
Second nominee and why?

39:51.906 --> 39:54.183
Our second nominee...

39:55.066 --> 39:56.610
is Mary.

39:58.380 --> 40:00.047
Mary?
Yes, chef.

40:00.048 --> 40:01.815
Why?

40:01.816 --> 40:03.350
We've come to the decision that

40:03.351 --> 40:07.354
Mary is one of our
weakest players on this team.

40:07.355 --> 40:08.856
Amanda, why are you
shaking your head?

40:08.857 --> 40:10.891
Because I did not agree
with the decision

40:10.892 --> 40:12.593
to put Mary up, chef.

40:12.594 --> 40:15.562
I had nominated Nedra,
chef, based on

40:15.563 --> 40:19.600
the execution of
the eggs Benedict station today.

40:19.601 --> 40:20.668
Ja'nel, please?

40:20.669 --> 40:22.670
I know that if I have an issue

40:22.671 --> 40:24.305
or I need help with something,

40:24.306 --> 40:27.975
that I would look to Nedra
before I looked to Mary.

40:27.976 --> 40:29.376
So you and Amanda disagree?

40:29.377 --> 40:32.179
Apparently we do, chef.

40:32.180 --> 40:34.782
It's definitely
all falling apart

40:34.783 --> 40:37.751
on the ladies' team,
let me tell you.

40:37.752 --> 40:40.788
Mary, Jacqueline,
step forward, please.

40:42.991 --> 40:45.092
Mary, why do you think
you should stay

40:45.093 --> 40:46.393
in Hell's Kitchen?

40:46.394 --> 40:47.795
I've been a fighter ever since

40:47.796 --> 40:49.463
the first night
I was up for elimination.

40:49.464 --> 40:52.333
<i>I made my mistakes, but
I didn't let it get me down,</i>

40:52.334 --> 40:53.400
and I picked back up, chef.

40:53.401 --> 40:54.935
<i>I'm a woman of my word,</i>

40:54.936 --> 40:56.503
<i>and I did not lie to you</i>

40:56.504 --> 40:59.506
when I said I had endurance
and tenacity.

41:01.276 --> 41:03.010
Jacqueline, why do you think

41:03.011 --> 41:04.511
you should stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

41:04.512 --> 41:05.813
I think I should stay
in Hell's Kitchen

41:05.814 --> 41:07.448
because I have the knowledge
and I have the power.

41:07.449 --> 41:10.384
Power in burning pancakes?

41:10.385 --> 41:12.853
The easiest dish
on the breakfast menu,

41:12.854 --> 41:14.154
and you managed to burn them.

41:14.155 --> 41:15.522
Chef, I burned two pancakes.

41:15.523 --> 41:17.257
And then the other ones
were handed to me to flip

41:17.258 --> 41:18.492
when I asked for help.

41:18.493 --> 41:21.495
Who couldn't flip a pancake,
Jacqueline?

41:21.496 --> 41:24.098
Nedra couldn't
flip a pancake, chef.

41:24.099 --> 41:25.866
Is that right, Nedra?

41:25.867 --> 41:29.803
The...

41:29.804 --> 41:31.171
You can't flip a pancake?

41:31.172 --> 41:32.606
I can flip a pancake, chef.

41:32.607 --> 41:33.974
The spatula that I was given,

41:33.975 --> 41:36.009
I couldn't flip it
with the spatula.

41:36.010 --> 41:38.679
So you're blaming the spatula?

41:40.315 --> 41:43.317
Another very difficult decision,
let me tell you.

41:45.387 --> 41:49.390
My decision is...

41:50.925 --> 41:53.527
Mary, Jacqueline.
You two, back in line.

41:53.528 --> 41:55.496
Thank you, chef.
Oh, my God.

41:57.799 --> 41:59.266
There is one of you here

41:59.267 --> 42:03.971
that is in way over their head.

42:03.972 --> 42:06.974
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen is...

42:11.846 --> 42:13.680
<i>Next time,
on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:13.681 --> 42:14.915
<i>My period's really late.</i>

42:14.916 --> 42:15.983
One chef...

42:15.984 --> 42:17.584
I just wanna know
if I'm pregnant.

42:17.585 --> 42:19.119
May be cooking for two.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.154
Ugh.

42:20.155 --> 42:21.555
This sucks.

42:21.556 --> 42:23.157
Will the news
kick in her hormones...

42:23.158 --> 42:24.691
You know what?
Shut up.

42:24.692 --> 42:27.428
Don't even talk to me anymore.
I'm serious.

42:27.429 --> 42:28.962
Or get her
kicked out of Hell's Kitchen?

42:28.963 --> 42:31.398
I can't go home.
I worked so hard for this.

42:31.399 --> 42:33.467
And, when a battle
erupts in the dorms...

42:33.468 --> 42:34.968
You sound like a little bitch.

42:34.969 --> 42:37.871
Will Ray go...
Little bitch! You're a bitch!

42:37.872 --> 42:40.274
Way too far?
Are they gonna fight?

42:40.275 --> 42:41.275
Just shut up!

42:41.276 --> 42:42.509
Get the out of my face.

42:42.510 --> 42:43.510
Find out next time...

42:43.511 --> 42:44.511
Bitch!

42:44.512 --> 42:46.780
Shut the up!

42:46.781 --> 42:48.415
When the gloves come off...

42:48.416 --> 42:49.416
Do something about it!

42:49.417 --> 42:50.617
I will ruin you.

42:50.618 --> 42:51.885
On a barefisted...

42:51.886 --> 42:53.587
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

42:53.588 --> 42:54.621
Boom!

42:54.622 --> 42:55.789
<i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

42:55.790 --> 42:56.791
<i>Little bitch.</i>
