a centurion. or whatever it is...

that he had already died.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.123
Okay. uh...

25:29.294 --> 25:33.959
Hebrew legend was that the true Messiah
cannot have his bones broken.

25:34.132 --> 25:36.965
Now, the two thieves
on Christ's right and left side...

25:37.135 --> 25:40.366
...had their legs broken
so they slumped over and suffocated.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.303
It was considered merciful.

25:42.474 --> 25:44.568
<i>Now, Longinus, a Roman soldier
fearing that others...</i>

25:44.743 --> 25:48.145
<i>...would break Christ's legs in a similar
fashion. lanced him in the side...</i>

25:52.317 --> 25:54.911

oi his body...

...and thereby
preserving his status as the Messiah.

25:58.490 --> 26:01.585
- It's an interesting tale.
GABRIEL: Longinus was almost blind.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.320
And as legend tells it...

26:04.496 --> 26:07.761
...some oi Christ's blood splashed
into his eyes and restored his sight.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.892
- Beats LASIK surgery.
- Ha. ha.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.935
So. what are you getting at?

26:13.705 --> 26:17.642
Well. throughout the ages.
men who carried the lance were blessed...

26:17.809 --> 26:21.177
...with great power and victory
on the battlefield.

26:21.346 --> 26:22.677
They became kings.

26:22.847 --> 26:28.547
The Emperors Constantine and Justinian
valued its possession above all others.

26:28.720 --> 26:33.590
Charlemagne claimed that it was responsible
for all of his victories on the battlefield.

26:33.758 --> 26:37.422
He also claimed that his only great defeat
came when he dropped the spear in battle.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.395
- And after Charlemagne?
- Uh, it was handed down through the ages.

26:40.565 --> 26:43.364
From king to king.
vanquished to conqueror.

26:43.535 --> 26:48.029
Uh, now, if it was dropped,
defeat was ensured.

26:48.206 --> 26:50.106
Eventually it came into the possession...

26:50.275 --> 26:54.075
...of one of history's greatest
little miscreants, Adolf Hitler.

26:54.646 --> 26:57.911

by both king or villain.
