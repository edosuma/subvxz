WEBVTT

00:02.173 --> 00:03.134
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:03.134 --> 00:04.705
ZOLA WAS OUR BABY,
AND SHE'S GONE,

00:04.705 --> 00:06.077
AND I DON'T WANT
ANOTHER BABY.

00:06.077 --> 00:07.478
(Miranda)
YOU AND I BROKE UP.

00:07.478 --> 00:09.480
YOU BASICALLY TOLD ME
TO WAIT FOR YOU.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.011
(Callie) WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

00:11.011 --> 00:13.214
(Teddy) THAT'S THE SCREW THAT
I JUST PULLED OUT OF HER HEART.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.346
I SUPERVISED YOU INSERTING
PEDICLE SCREWS AND A PLATE.

00:15.346 --> 00:16.617
SHE'S HALF DEAD.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.149
DR. ALTMAN'S REPAIRING
HER HEART RIGHT NOW.

00:18.149 --> 00:19.720
SO WHO'S GONNA BE
OPERATING ON ME?

00:19.720 --> 00:21.092
(Teddy) CRISTINA.

00:21.092 --> 00:22.393
(Miranda)
IT'S HER MENTOR'S HUSBAND.

00:22.393 --> 00:24.525
CRISTINA DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW
THAT IT'S HENRY.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.697
(Derek) MEREDITH AND ALEX
ARE TRAPPED IN AN AMBULANCE

00:26.697 --> 00:28.799
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY.
WE THINK THEY GOT HIT.

00:28.799 --> 00:30.131
(Mark) THEY'RE SITTING
IN A POWDER KEG.

00:30.131 --> 00:33.564
(Alex) WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE
BEFORE THIS THING BLOWS.

00:33.564 --> 00:35.236
(Owen) IT'S NOT RIGHT.
IF SHE FINDS OUT THAT I WAITED,

00:35.236 --> 00:36.807
SHE WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME.

00:36.807 --> 00:39.039
(Richard) HER HUSBAND
JUST DIED IN OUR O.R.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.772
SHE'LL NEVER FORGIVE ANY OF US.

00:43.174 --> 00:44.275
(rainfall)

00:44.275 --> 00:46.177
(Meredith)
VICTIMS OF A SUDDEN IMPACT

00:46.177 --> 00:48.149
ARE SOME OF THE HARDEST
TO TREAT.

00:48.149 --> 00:51.082
(clattering)

00:51.082 --> 00:53.684
IT'S NOT JUST THE COLLISION
THAT INJURES THEM.

00:53.684 --> 00:55.086
IT'S EVERYTHING AFTER.

00:55.086 --> 00:58.489
THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE
KEEPS THEM MOVING,

00:58.489 --> 01:00.231
TOSSING THEM FROM VEHICLES,

01:00.231 --> 01:02.393
THROWING THEM
THROUGH WINDSHIELDS,

01:02.393 --> 01:06.097
SLAMMING THEIR INTERNAL ORGANS
INTO THE SKELETON.

01:06.097 --> 01:08.139
(monitor beeping erratically)

01:08.139 --> 01:09.570
THEIR BODIES ARE INJURED
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.772
(beeping continues)

01:11.772 --> 01:13.444
(speaking inaudibly)

01:14.745 --> 01:17.178
SO THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW

01:17.178 --> 01:19.350
HOW MUCH DAMAGE
HAS ACTUALLY BEEN DONE...

01:19.350 --> 01:21.081
(thunder rumbles)

01:21.081 --> 01:23.114
UNTIL THEY STOP.
(cracks)

01:23.114 --> 01:24.315
(Alex) SIR?

01:24.315 --> 01:25.316
(groans)

01:25.316 --> 01:26.487
CAN YOU MOVE?
(groan)

01:26.487 --> 01:28.119
WE NEED TO GET YOU
OFF THIS ROAD.

01:28.119 --> 01:29.590
HONEY.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.223
(crying) JESSICA.

01:32.223 --> 01:33.093
ANSWER ME.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.325
(clattering)

01:34.325 --> 01:36.167
(man grunts)

01:36.167 --> 01:37.468
(girl) MOM?

01:37.468 --> 01:40.231
MOM. MOM, WAKE UP.

01:40.231 --> 01:41.202
(grunting)

01:41.202 --> 01:42.533
MOM, WAKE UP!

01:42.533 --> 01:43.634
(Alex) SORRY.

01:43.634 --> 01:45.176
HELP THEM, PLEASE.
YOU HAVE TO HELP!

01:45.176 --> 01:46.337
(crying)
MY MOM, MY DAD,

01:46.337 --> 01:48.839
THE VAN--
AND I JUST STEPPED IN BLOOD.

01:48.839 --> 01:51.142
I-I JUST STEPPED IN BLOOD.
HEY, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

01:51.142 --> 01:52.443
LILY.
OKAY, LILY,
I NEED YOU TO CALM DOWN

01:52.443 --> 01:54.245
AND TAKE THE BABY.
HOLD THE BABY.

01:54.245 --> 01:55.616
I DON'T EVEN BABYSIT.
I CAN'T HOLD A BABY.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.488
LILY, DO YOU WANT ME TO HELP
YOUR FAMILY OR NOT?

01:57.488 --> 01:58.549
HOLD THE BABY.

01:58.549 --> 01:59.720
(cries)

01:59.720 --> 02:02.753
OKAY, I NEED YOU TO SQUEEZE.
ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.

02:02.753 --> 02:04.295
WHAT IF I MESS UP?

02:04.295 --> 02:05.726
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MESS UP, LILY.
ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.127
COUNT OUT LOUD
SO I CAN HEAR YOU.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.459
OKAY,
ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.

02:08.459 --> 02:10.461
ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.

02:10.461 --> 02:12.463
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,
DON'T STOP SQUEEZING.

02:12.463 --> 02:14.235
ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.536
ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.

02:15.536 --> 02:16.707
ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.

02:16.707 --> 02:18.169
YEAH.

02:18.169 --> 02:21.172
MA'AM, MA'AM, I'M A DOCTOR.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

02:21.172 --> 02:23.544
(lightning cracks,
thunder rumbles)

02:23.544 --> 02:25.316
(people speaking indistinctly)

02:25.316 --> 02:27.618
I DON'T KNOW.
THREE OR FOUR HOURS I THINK.

02:27.618 --> 02:28.779
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
HANG ON A SECOND.

02:28.779 --> 02:30.321
THE DOCTOR'S BACK.

02:30.321 --> 02:31.422
THIS IS LAURA'S MOM.

02:31.422 --> 02:33.254
SHE WANTS TO KNOW HOW LONG
THE SURGERY SHOULD TAKE.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.225
UH, THAT DEPENDS.

02:34.225 --> 02:36.257
DR. ALTMAN IS WORKING ON
THE REPAIR RIGHT NOW.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.228
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

02:37.228 --> 02:39.290
UM, HE SAYS DR. ALTMAN'S
STILL...

02:39.290 --> 02:41.332
NO, ALTMAN.
MM-HMM.

02:41.332 --> 02:42.833
NO, FOR THE HEART.

02:42.833 --> 02:44.835
Y-YOU KNOW, C-CAN YOU TALK
TO HER?

02:44.835 --> 02:46.437
UH, YEAH.

02:46.437 --> 02:48.869
HI, THIS IS DR. AVERY.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.242
SHE'S
A CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEON.

02:51.242 --> 02:55.906
NO, NO, THIS--
THIS IS THE HEART.

02:55.906 --> 02:59.280
NO, IT'S REALLY HARD
TO TELL AT THIS POINT.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.851
(Miranda)
OH, NO. THIS IS CRUEL.

03:00.851 --> 03:03.384
HER HUSBAND IS DEAD,
AND SHE HAS NO IDEA.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.356
SHE'S SEWING A WOMAN'S
HEART BACK TOGETHER.

03:05.356 --> 03:06.587
COME ON. THERE'S GOTTA BE
A BETTER WAY TO HANDLE THIS.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.359
THERE'S NO GOOD WAY
TO HANDLE IT, BAILEY.

03:08.359 --> 03:10.391
THIS IS
AN IMPOSSIBLE DECISION.

03:10.391 --> 03:13.364
SO YOU LAND ON THE SIDE
OF WHAT IS BEST FOR THE PATIENT,

03:13.364 --> 03:14.565
THE ONE WHO'S STILL ALIVE.

03:14.565 --> 03:16.297
TEDDY WILL UNDERSTAND.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.268
YOU THINK SO?

03:19.900 --> 03:21.602
(exhales deeply)

03:21.602 --> 03:23.704
(lighting cracks)

03:23.704 --> 03:26.707
YOU GOT ANY TAPE IN THERE? I
HAVE TO DO AN ADHESIVE DRESSING.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.208
PROBABLY.
I JUST GRABBED WHATEVER.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.280
IS MY MOM OKAY? MOM?

03:29.280 --> 03:30.511
LILY, KEEP COUNTING.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.942
WHY ISN'T--
WHY ISN'T SHE TALKING?

03:31.942 --> 03:33.614
(Meredith) LILY!

03:33.614 --> 03:35.386
ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.

03:35.386 --> 03:36.547
HOW'S SHE DOING?

03:36.547 --> 03:38.889
NOT GOOD.
I MAY HAVE TO INTUBATE.

03:38.889 --> 03:40.421
DON'T YOU HAVE TO DO
A PRESSURE DRESSING?

03:40.421 --> 03:42.593
UGH. I SEE GRAY MATTER.

03:42.593 --> 03:44.395
BRAINS ARE ON THE GROUND.

03:44.395 --> 03:45.396
WAIT. THAT'S NANA.
THAT'S MY NA--

03:45.396 --> 03:46.557
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO.

03:46.557 --> 03:47.898
OH, CRAP.

03:47.898 --> 03:50.731
THIS KID'S GOT A SHARD
OF GLASS IN HER EYE.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.703
SHE'S UNCONSCIOUS.
HER PULSE IS LOW.

03:52.703 --> 03:54.435
THAT'S MY SISTER.
THAT'S ABBY.
LILY...

03:54.435 --> 03:55.936
JUST SEE THE BLINKER
ON THE VAN?

03:55.936 --> 03:57.808
JUST WATCH THAT BLINKER
AND KEEP COUNTING.

03:57.808 --> 03:58.969
(Meredith and Lily)
ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.

03:58.969 --> 04:00.711
ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.

04:00.711 --> 04:02.343
LILY.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.544

04:03.544 --> 04:05.476
I JUST HELPED ONE AND THE OTHER
ONE'S RIGHT OVER THERE.

04:05.476 --> 04:06.647
AND MICHAEL?

04:06.647 --> 04:08.549
WHAT ABOUT MICHAEL?

04:08.549 --> 04:10.250
THERE'S ANOTHER KID?

04:10.250 --> 04:13.023
(thunder rumbling)

04:13.023 --> 04:14.024
(man groans)

04:14.024 --> 04:16.026
OH, CRAP.

04:16.026 --> 04:17.027
THERE'S NO PULSE.
MICHAEL?

04:17.027 --> 04:18.489
DAD! DAD!

04:18.489 --> 04:19.730
(Meredith)
LILY, KEEP COUNTING!

04:19.730 --> 04:21.292
ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.

04:21.292 --> 04:23.294
ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.

04:23.294 --> 04:25.666
ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.

04:25.666 --> 04:26.797

04:29.970 --> 04:32.703
OKAY. UM, I'M--I'M GONNA
CHECK YOUR PULSE.

04:32.703 --> 04:34.345
PULSE IS A LITTLE WEAK.

04:34.345 --> 04:36.507
ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA TRY
TO FREE YOUR LEGS, OKAY?

04:36.507 --> 04:38.679
(Lily) ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.
(debris clatters)

04:38.679 --> 04:40.981
ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.
(tires squealing)

04:40.981 --> 04:42.282
ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.414
(metal squeaks)

04:43.414 --> 04:45.015
(squealing continues)

04:45.015 --> 04:46.387
MEREDITH,
THERE'S A CAR COMING!

04:46.387 --> 04:47.488
OH, CRAP.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.919
CAN YOU FEEL YOUR LEGS?

04:48.919 --> 04:50.521
YOU GOTTA GET OUTTA THERE!
MICHAEL!

04:50.521 --> 04:52.493
HE'S TRAPPED. I HAVE TO GET

04:52.493 --> 04:53.724
THERE'S NOT TIME!
OH, MY GOD!

04:53.724 --> 04:55.396
KID, JUST KEEP COUNTING.
MEREDITH!

04:55.396 --> 04:57.067
OH, MY GOD.
YOU GOTTA GET OFF THE ROAD!

04:57.067 --> 04:58.999
(grunts) COME ON.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.571
COME ON!
OH, MY GOD.

05:00.571 --> 05:01.772
HELP ME.
MEREDITH!

05:01.772 --> 05:03.674
...SQUEEZE.
NO, DON'T LEAVE ME.

05:03.674 --> 05:06.437
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU--
THEY'RE NOT EVEN GONNA SEE YOU!

05:06.437 --> 05:07.678
MEREDITH,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

05:07.678 --> 05:09.480
(engine rumbling)

05:09.480 --> 05:11.412
STOP! PLEASE!

05:11.412 --> 05:12.843
(brakes squeak)

05:12.843 --> 05:14.985
(air hisses)

05:14.985 --> 05:17.017
(man coughs)
SON OF A...

05:17.017 --> 05:18.389
(pants and groans)

05:18.389 --> 05:20.351
IT'S OKAY. YOU'RE OKAY.

05:20.351 --> 05:21.592
(moans)
ALL RIGHT? JUST BREATHE.

05:21.592 --> 05:23.354
JUST BREATHE.
HELP IS HERE.

05:23.354 --> 05:24.855
HELP IS HERE.

05:24.855 --> 05:26.597

(Lily) ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE.
ONE, TWO, SQUEEZE...
(pants)

05:43.343 --> 05:44.114
B.P.'s DOWN
AND SHE'S TACHYCARDIC.

05:45.476 --> 05:46.717
(man) ...UNITS OF L.R.

05:46.717 --> 05:48.048
13-YEAR-OLD FEMALE,

05:48.048 --> 05:49.550
MULTIPLE FACIAL FRACTURES.
FOREIGN BODY TO THE EYE.

05:49.550 --> 05:50.921
YOU'RE BLEEDING
YOU NEED STITCHES.

05:50.921 --> 05:52.783
NO, I'LL BE OKAY.
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF IT.

05:52.783 --> 05:55.355
TAKE THE MOM TO TRAUMA TWO.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.658
AND WE NEED TO STAFF AS MANY
O.R.s UPSTAIRS AS POSSIBLE.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.829
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT LATER,
I PROMISE.

05:58.829 --> 05:59.990
GO. WE'LL TALK LATER.

05:59.990 --> 06:01.892
WHAT DO WE GOT?

06:01.892 --> 06:03.894
(man) 14-YEAR-OLD MALE,

ABDOMINAL PAIN. LAST VITALS

06:06.066 --> 06:07.668
AND A PULSE OF 120.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.800
GREY, YOU NEED SOMEONE
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.442
IT'S FINE.
WHERE DO YOU WANT ME?

06:11.442 --> 06:12.473
BAILEY NEEDS HANDS
ON BED FOUR.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.074
WAIT. IS THAT MY MOM?

06:14.074 --> 06:15.806
COULD YOU GET HER
BACK IN THE BED?
BUT THAT--THAT'S MY MOM.

06:15.806 --> 06:17.678
SHE NEEDS TO BE CHECKED OUT.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.450
DR. HUNT,
HOW CAN I HELP?

06:19.450 --> 06:21.852
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
IS ALTMAN OUT OF SURGERY?

06:21.852 --> 06:23.814
UH, ALMOST. SHE'S ABOUT TO
TAKE HER OFF BYPASS,

06:23.814 --> 06:25.085
BUT OUR PAGERS KEPT GOING OFF,

06:25.085 --> 06:26.417
SO SHE FIGURED, MAYBE YOU

06:26.417 --> 06:29.059
DR. WEBBER, I COULD USE YOU

06:29.059 --> 06:30.421

06:30.421 --> 06:32.162
OKAY, GO BACK
INTO ALTMAN'S SURGERY

06:32.162 --> 06:34.725
AND TELL HER
THAT I DIDN'T NEED YOU.

06:34.725 --> 06:36.597
I WAS REALLY HOPING
TO LOG SOME MORE TRAUMA HOURS.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.599
KEPNER...

06:38.599 --> 06:39.800
(sirens wailing)

06:39.800 --> 06:42.773
ALTMAN'S HUSBAND DIED
IN SURGERY,

06:42.773 --> 06:44.404
AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW,
SO I NEED YOU IN THE O.R.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.736

06:49.409 --> 06:51.181
KEPNER, CAN YOU HANDLE THIS?

06:51.181 --> 06:52.513
(indistinct conversations)

06:52.513 --> 06:53.684
UM, YEAH, YES.

06:53.684 --> 06:55.045
NO. NO, NO, NO.

06:55.045 --> 06:56.447
YOU CAN'T GO INTO HER SURGERY
LIKE THAT.

06:56.447 --> 06:59.019
SO GO TO THE GALLERY AND WATCH
THE SURGERY FROM THERE.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.851
OKAY?

07:00.851 --> 07:04.525
(indistinct conversations
continue)

07:04.525 --> 07:05.956
SHE WENT ABOUT TWO HOURS
WITH NO ANTIBIOTICS

07:05.956 --> 07:07.958
AND AN UNKNOWN AMOUNT OF FLUIDS
'CAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE A PUMP.

07:07.958 --> 07:09.600
ALL RIGHT. CAREFUL WITH
THAT SUCTION.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.761
WE WEREN'T ABLE TO SUCTION
FOR A WHILE.

07:10.761 --> 07:11.932
HER PNEUMONIA
MAY BE GETTING WORSE.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.163
SHE PROBABLY NEEDS
ANOTHER X-RAY.

07:13.163 --> 07:14.705
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

07:14.705 --> 07:16.206
YOU DID EXTRAORDINARY WORK
TONIGHT, KAREV.

07:16.206 --> 07:17.708
I'VE GOT IT FROM HERE.

07:17.708 --> 07:18.809
NO. WHAT? NO.

07:18.809 --> 07:20.140
YES. YOU WERE
IN A MAJOR ACCIDENT.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.512
YOU NEED TO GO GET YOURSELF
CHECKED OUT.

07:21.512 --> 07:23.013
TAKE A BREATH. YOU'RE GONNA
SIT THIS ONE OUT.

07:23.013 --> 07:24.174
I'M NOT SITTING ANYTHING OUT.

07:24.174 --> 07:26.176
YES, YOU ARE.

07:26.176 --> 07:28.549
(people speaking indistinctly)

07:28.549 --> 07:30.180
GOOD-BYE.

07:30.180 --> 07:32.182
(babies crying)

07:32.182 --> 07:34.184
(people continues
speaking indistinctly)

07:34.184 --> 07:35.556
OKAY, WHAT DO WE GOT?

07:35.556 --> 07:36.527
HIS PELVIS IS DUST.

07:36.527 --> 07:38.188
(groans)
MUST BE
MASSIVE INTERNAL BLEEDING.

07:38.188 --> 07:39.860
CAN'T KEEP HIS SYSTOLIC
ABOVE 68.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.962
OKAY, THERE'S DEFINITELY
FREE FLUID IN HIS ABDOMEN.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.565
IT'S JUST HARD TO DEFINE WHERE
THE BLEEDING'S COMING FROM.

07:44.565 --> 07:45.195
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO START?

07:45.195 --> 07:46.737
PELVIS.
ABDOMEN.

07:46.737 --> 07:50.040
(groaning and muttering)

07:50.040 --> 07:51.902
ABBY COULDN'T WAIT
TO SLEEP IN A TENT.

07:51.902 --> 07:53.504
SIR, I'M DR. HUNT.

07:53.504 --> 07:54.575
(Richard)
B.P.'s STILL DROPPING

07:54.575 --> 07:55.746
WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING YOU
UP TO SURGERY.

07:55.746 --> 07:56.977
LILY DIDN'T EVEN
WANT TO COME.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.148
OKAY, IF WE DON'T STABILIZE
THIS PELVIS,

07:58.148 --> 07:59.550
THERE WON'T BE ANY SURGERY.

07:59.550 --> 08:00.511
THERE'S NO TIME
FOR FIXATORS.

08:00.511 --> 08:01.682
SHE WANTED TO SPEND
HER BIRTHDAY WITH FRIENDS,

08:01.682 --> 08:02.753
NOT--NOT CAMPING WITH US.

08:02.753 --> 08:03.984
I SAID NO.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.816
(voice breaking) I MADE HER
COME. OH, MY GOD, I--

08:05.816 --> 08:08.088
I DID THIS TO THEM.
I DID THIS.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.060
YOU DIDN'T HARM YOUR FAMILY.

08:10.060 --> 08:11.892
YOU DIDN'T MEAN
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.223
YOU DIDN'T DO THIS.

08:13.223 --> 08:15.265
OKAY, SIR, I AM REALLY SORRY,

08:15.265 --> 08:16.727
BUT EVEN WITH THE PAINKILLERS,
THIS IS GONNA HURT.

08:16.727 --> 08:17.998
(crack)

08:17.998 --> 08:19.269
AAH!

08:19.269 --> 08:20.601
THAT SHOULD HOLD FOR NOW.

08:20.601 --> 08:21.572
OKAY, LET'S GET HIM
TO SURGERY.

08:21.572 --> 08:22.733
OKAY.

08:22.733 --> 08:23.834
(pager beeps)

08:23.834 --> 08:25.676
ALTMAN PAGED. 9-1-1.

08:25.676 --> 08:27.507
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

08:27.507 --> 08:29.509
UH, UH, WE GOT THIS. GO.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.011
SCRUB IN WHEN YOU CAN.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.683
(door opens)
(Owen) YOU PAGED?

08:32.683 --> 08:34.745
YEAH, THE PATIENT'S GOT
A FLAIL MITRAL VALVE.

08:34.745 --> 08:36.286
THE SUTURES FOR THE PATCH

08:36.286 --> 08:38.619
CAUGHT ON THE VALVE
WHEN WE WENT ON BYPASS.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.920
UH, WHAT CAN I DO?

08:39.920 --> 08:41.251
YOU CAN TELL ME
WHERE CRISTINA IS.

08:41.251 --> 08:42.823
I'VE BEEN PAGING HER,
BUT SHE WON'T ANSWER.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.294
DAMN IT.
WHY WON'T THIS HOLD?

08:44.294 --> 08:46.627
OKAY, YOU NEED A RESIDENT?
I'LL GET YOU A RESIDENT.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.128
NO, NOT A RESIDENT.
YANG.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.130
THIS IS... (sighs)
I NEED ANOTHER ME,

08:50.130 --> 08:51.862
AND SHE IS THE CLOSEST THING.

08:51.862 --> 08:53.103
DON'TTELL HER I SAID THAT.

08:53.103 --> 08:54.805
SHE JUST GOT OUT OF SURGERY.
SHE'S EXHAUSTED.

08:54.805 --> 08:55.966
ALL RIGHT, WELL, SPLASH
SOME WATER ON HER FACE

08:55.966 --> 08:57.207
AND GET HER IN HERE.

08:57.207 --> 09:00.611
SHE CAN HANDLE IT.
ALL RIGHT, SPONGE STICK.

09:00.611 --> 09:02.012
(sighs) DAMN IT.

09:02.012 --> 09:03.243
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

09:03.243 --> 09:05.746
(people speaking indistinctly)

09:05.746 --> 09:08.548
LET'S GET AN IRRIGATION TRAY
AND START CLEANING THIS UP.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.050
CRANIOFACIAL LAC?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.722
OH, IT'S WORSE THAN THAT.

09:11.722 --> 09:13.884
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A RETINAL-VITREOUS SURGEON.

09:13.884 --> 09:16.186
YEAH. I'VE GOT LEXIE CALLING
AROUND FOR ONE RIGHT NOW.

09:16.186 --> 09:17.287
PARKER ISN'T ANSWERING,

09:17.287 --> 09:18.659
AND WALDMAN IS GONNA BE
AT LEAST ANOTHER HOUR.

09:18.659 --> 09:19.860
TRY JASSY.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.331
JASSY?
(keypad beeping)

09:21.331 --> 09:24.595
NO, I GOT SOMEONE WHO WILL
RUN CIRCLES AROUND JASSY.

09:24.595 --> 09:25.936
(cell phone beeps)

09:25.936 --> 09:27.097
HEY, BABE.

09:27.097 --> 09:28.869
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

09:28.869 --> 09:30.140
HOLD ON, JULIA.

09:30.140 --> 09:31.672
SHE'S GREAT. YOU'LL LOVE HER.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.572
UM, YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA TAKE
AT LEAST 45 MINUTES

09:32.572 --> 09:33.904
TO GET HERE
FROM SEATTLE PRES.

09:33.904 --> 09:35.345
SHE'S NOT AT SEATTLE PRES.
SHE'S AT MY PLACE.

09:35.345 --> 09:37.207
IT'S FIVE MINUTES AWAY.

09:37.207 --> 09:40.080
HEY, HOW'D YOU LIKE TO OPERATE
WITH ME AND DEREK TONIGHT?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.251
(grunts)

09:41.251 --> 09:43.954
IT--IT HURTS.
MY STOMACH REALLY HURTS.

09:43.954 --> 09:45.255
OKAY, MICHAEL, WE GAVE YOU
SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN.

09:45.255 --> 09:46.687
IT SHOULD KICK IN
IN A MINUTE.

09:46.687 --> 09:47.988
ABDOMEN FEELS RIGID.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.860
(groans)

09:49.860 --> 09:51.662
YEP.

09:51.662 --> 09:53.123
FREE FLUID IN THE RIGHT
UPPER QUADRANT.

09:53.123 --> 09:55.095
SO THAT COULD BE A LIVER LAC.
WE SHOULD ORDER A C.T.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.767
(Lily, crying)
NO, KEEP TRYING!

09:56.767 --> 09:58.598
THAT'S MY MOM!
OKAY, MICHAEL, I NEED YOU
TO STAY STILL, PLEASE.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.670
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:59.670 --> 10:01.231
YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE UP.
YOU HAVE TO KEEP TRYING.

10:01.231 --> 10:02.332
SHE ALREADY WATCHED
THE GRANDMOTHER DIE.

10:02.332 --> 10:04.835
YEAH, GO, GO.

10:04.835 --> 10:06.707
(Lily crying)

10:06.707 --> 10:08.138
HOW LONG YOU BEEN GOING?

10:08.138 --> 10:10.140
WHAT HAVE YOU GIVEN HER
AND WHAT HAVE HER RHYTHMS BEEN?

10:10.140 --> 10:11.712
SHE'S BEEN CODING
FOR 30 MINUTES.

10:11.712 --> 10:12.783
SHE'S ALREADY GOTTEN LIDOCAINE
AND AMIODARONE.

10:12.783 --> 10:14.144
OKAY, HER KID'S OUTSIDE
THE WINDOW WATCHING.

10:14.144 --> 10:15.615
WE NEED TO GO AGAIN.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.917
CHARGE TO 360.
CLEAR.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.248
(defibrillator beeps,
paddles thunk)

10:18.248 --> 10:19.950
(monitor beeping erratically)

10:19.950 --> 10:22.252
PUSH ANOTHER OF EPI.
LET'S CHARGE AGAIN.
(crying) PLEASE.

10:22.252 --> 10:24.324
PLEASE.
(defibrillator beeps,
paddles thunk)

10:24.324 --> 10:25.726
DR. GREY.

10:25.726 --> 10:26.697
DAMN IT.

10:26.697 --> 10:27.858
(beeping continues)

10:27.858 --> 10:29.159
CHARGE AGAIN.

10:29.159 --> 10:30.330
(mouths word)

10:30.330 --> 10:31.702
(defibrillator whines)

10:31.702 --> 10:32.833
CLEAR.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.334
(defibrillator beeps,
paddles thunk)

10:34.334 --> 10:35.706
(beeping continues)

10:35.706 --> 10:36.867
(single beep)

10:36.867 --> 10:38.038
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

10:38.038 --> 10:40.040
(whispers)
DAMN IT. COME ON. COME ON.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.672
(sighs)

10:41.672 --> 10:42.642
MOM.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.014
(beeping and tone continue)

10:44.014 --> 10:45.746
(sighs)

10:45.746 --> 10:48.048
TIME OF DEATH--2:27.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.950
(air hisses)

11:14.174 --> 11:16.146
HAND ME THE ULTRASOUND
AND GET ME A KIT.

11:16.146 --> 11:18.048
WE'RE DOING
A BEDSIDE GASTROSTOMY.

11:18.048 --> 11:19.409
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

11:19.409 --> 11:20.951
WE NEED TO DECOMPRESS
HER STOMACH

11:20.951 --> 11:22.112
SO SHE DOESN'T GET
MORE REFLUX INTO HER TRACHEA.

11:22.112 --> 11:23.213
KAREV,
YOU'RE NOT ON THIS CASE.

11:23.213 --> 11:25.255
LOOK, I'VE BEEN WITH
THIS BABY SINCE YESTERDAY.

11:25.255 --> 11:27.758
OKAY? SHE ALMOST DIED.
I ALMOST DIED.

11:27.758 --> 11:30.190
I DIDN'T GO THROUGH HELL
WITH THIS KID TO JUST BACK OFF.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.964
(babies crying)

11:33.964 --> 11:35.395
THEN SLOW DOWN.

11:35.395 --> 11:38.028
OKAY? WE DON'T NEED
TO RUSH THROUGH THIS.

11:38.028 --> 11:39.169
YEAH, I KNOW. JUST--
SUCTION, PLEASE.

11:39.169 --> 11:40.700
(suction gurgles)

11:40.700 --> 11:42.172
(Owen) CRISTINA,
JUST STOP FOR ONE MINUTE

11:42.172 --> 11:44.134
AND LISTEN
TO WHAT I HAVE TO--

11:44.134 --> 11:45.075
NO. I SAID NO.

11:45.075 --> 11:46.236
I KNOW YOU'RE EXHAUSTED.

11:46.236 --> 11:47.407
THIS IS A MITRAL VALVE RE--

11:47.407 --> 11:48.939
I AM NOT OPERATING NOW!

11:48.939 --> 11:50.240
SHE REQUESTED YOU.
NOW IF YOU DON'T GO IN THERE--

11:50.240 --> 11:52.242
TEDDY REQUESTED ME?

11:52.242 --> 11:55.245
(exhales deeply)

11:55.245 --> 11:58.288
OH, MY GOD.
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD HER.

11:58.288 --> 12:00.150
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD HER YET?

12:00.150 --> 12:02.192
WHAT ARE YOU--
NO, NO.

12:02.192 --> 12:04.154
NO, I AM NOT--
NO, I'M NOT GOING IN--

12:04.154 --> 12:05.956
CRISTINA, IF THAT PATIENT
DIES ON THE TABLE,

12:05.956 --> 12:07.828
THIS WILL ALL HAVE BEEN
FOR NOTHING.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.159
THIS HAS...

12:09.159 --> 12:10.300
THIS HAS TO BE
WORTH SOMETHING.

12:10.300 --> 12:13.033
SAVING A LIFE
IS WORTH SOMETHING.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.404
(pants)

12:14.404 --> 12:16.136
(voice breaking) I CAN'T.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.437
I CAN'T.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.509
I CAN'T. I CAN'T DO IT.

12:19.509 --> 12:21.271
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

12:21.271 --> 12:23.043
SHE'S WAITING.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.245
SO GO.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.149
HOW MUCH TRAUMA
HAS YOUR GIRLFRIEND DONE?

12:29.149 --> 12:30.120
A LOT.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.182
SHE'S TOLD ME ABOUT
A BUNCH OF HER CASES.

12:32.182 --> 12:34.484
OH, SO WE'RE JUST GOING OFF
YOUR PILLOW TALK?
(elevator bell dings)

12:34.484 --> 12:36.126
IF I GET A HINT THAT YOUR
GIRLFRIEND IS IN OVER HER HEAD,

12:36.126 --> 12:37.287
I'M GONNA BOOT HER
OUT OF MY O.R.

12:37.287 --> 12:38.458
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS?

12:38.458 --> 12:39.830
YOU DON'T THINK
ANYONE WHO SLEEPS WITH ME

12:39.830 --> 12:41.131
CAN BE TALENTED
OR HAVE HALF A BRAIN.

12:41.131 --> 12:42.292
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

12:42.292 --> 12:43.463
IT'S MOSTLY TRUE.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.935
YEAH.
YEAH, IT'S MOSTLY TRUE.

12:44.935 --> 12:46.766
YOUR EX-WIFE IS BRILLIANT,
AND SHE SLEPT WITH ME.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.298
WELL--
I'M NOT TRYING
TO START A FIGHT.

12:48.298 --> 12:49.539
I'M JUST SAYIN'.

12:49.539 --> 12:50.871
(inhales deeply)

12:52.372 --> 12:53.904
AH, DR. CANNER,

12:53.904 --> 12:56.176
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
SHOWING UP ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.307
NO PROBLEM.

12:57.307 --> 12:59.950
FASTBALL HERE JUST UPDATED ME
ABOUT YOUR PATIENT.

12:59.950 --> 13:01.411
(sighs) AGAIN, I AM--
I'M REALLY SORRY

13:01.411 --> 13:02.853
FOR HITTING YOU
IN THE--

13:02.853 --> 13:05.956
I'M FINE. MY BREAST
MADE A QUICK RECOVERY.

13:05.956 --> 13:07.157
MM.
IT DID.

13:07.157 --> 13:09.159
OKAY,MARK.

13:09.159 --> 13:12.192
THE GLASS PENETRATED THE GLOBE
THROUGH TO THE ORBIT.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.864
(Derek) SO SHE'S GONNA LOSE
THE EYE?

13:13.864 --> 13:15.225
NORMALLY, YES.

13:15.225 --> 13:17.327
I WAS THINKING, IF YOU USED
A TEMPORAL APPROACH

13:17.327 --> 13:19.199
TO EXPOSE THE ORBIT
AND DECOMPRESS THE EYE,

13:19.199 --> 13:20.971
WE COULD SAVE IT.

13:20.971 --> 13:23.503
WELL, IF YOU DO THAT,
THERE'S MORE RISK OF BLEEDING.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.005
THAT'S TRUE.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.306
I COULD GET CONTROL
OF THE BLOOD SUPPLY FIRST,

13:26.306 --> 13:27.878
THEN ENUCLEATE THE EYE.

13:27.878 --> 13:30.440
BUT I THINK THE EYE
IS SALVAGEABLE.

13:30.440 --> 13:33.283
EITHER WAY, IT'S YOUR CALL.

13:33.283 --> 13:35.285
LET'S SAVE THE EYE.

13:35.285 --> 13:36.586
AGREED.

13:40.891 --> 13:43.894
(people speaking indistinctly)

13:46.927 --> 13:49.529
(exhales deeply) LILY.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.331
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT YOUR MOM.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.233
YEAH.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.135
(sirens wailing)

13:55.135 --> 13:57.067
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

13:57.067 --> 13:59.239
YOUR DAD AND YOUR SISTER
ARE IN SURGERY.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.241
AND I'M ABOUT TO TAKE
YOUR BROTHER UP

14:01.241 --> 14:03.613
TO REPAIR A TEAR
IN HIS LIVER.

14:03.613 --> 14:05.916
OKAY.

14:05.916 --> 14:07.277
DO YOU KNOW
IF ANYONE IN YOUR FAMILY

14:07.277 --> 14:10.120

TELL US WOULD HELP.
