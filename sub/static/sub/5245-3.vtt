03:57.572 --> 03:59.449
A <i>PAISA</i> ROBIN HOOD

04:04.162 --> 04:06.289
My name is everywhere.

04:10.376 --> 04:11.711
Newspapers...

04:14.005 --> 04:15.506
magazines...

04:20.178 --> 04:24.098
Everyone is talking about
the "Paisa Robin Hood."

04:24.182 --> 04:25.975
Pablito, I'm sorry. If I had known that--

04:26.059 --> 04:28.353
You're going to have
to pay for that, my love.

04:29.354 --> 04:31.356
Anything you want, Pablito.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.399
Anything I want?

04:33.483 --> 04:35.860
Yes, my love, whatever you want.

04:35.944 --> 04:37.487
You sure?

04:55.797 --> 04:56.965
Then...

04:59.133 --> 05:02.261
you're going to help me
get into Congress.

05:05.473 --> 05:06.724
Yes, Pablo.

05:08.101 --> 05:09.185
Yes.

05:22.699 --> 05:24.575
Those shitty oligarchs...

05:27.078 --> 05:28.871
those people, all of their lives...

05:30.665 --> 05:34.252
don't know what it's like to wonder
where their next meal is coming from.

05:37.547 --> 05:39.882
I come from nothing, Valeria...

05:41.592 --> 05:44.095
and I have more money
than any of those sons of bitches.

05:44.178 --> 05:48.057
If you run for Congress, you put yourself
in the public eye, you become a target.

05:49.350 --> 05:53.479
"I made my money from taxis" isn't going
to work when you face the press.

05:54.772 --> 05:58.401
Pablo, you need a party that supports you.

05:58.484 --> 06:01.612
You need a proper political campaign.

06:03.031 --> 06:04.949
I buy the press, my love.

06:06.242 --> 06:07.785
And as far as a political party,

06:07.869 --> 06:10.538
lam quite sure
that I can buy one of those as well.

06:12.165 --> 06:13.458
I don't want to be good.

06:17.045 --> 06:18.796
I am going to be great.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.048
A PAISA ROBIN HOOD

06:35.730 --> 06:37.356
WELCOME TO THE PABLO ESCOBAR
NEIGHBORHOOD

06:37.440 --> 06:38.775
A PEACEFUL ENVIRONMENT

07:12.767 --> 07:14.977
I should have gotten
into the taxi business. Holy cow...

07:15.061 --> 07:17.271
- Valeria, how are you doing?
- Well, thank you.

07:17.355 --> 07:18.773
Mr. Duque...

07:18.940 --> 07:22.193
It gives me great pleasure to invite you
to the Hacienda Nápoles.

07:22.276 --> 07:23.820
- Nice to meet you.
- Please, come.

07:24.612 --> 07:25.822
After you, Valeria.

07:28.741 --> 07:29.951
Please.

07:31.744 --> 07:36.165
Look, I am not a rich person.
I am a poor person with money.

07:36.999 --> 07:39.168
And for that reason, I think that...

07:40.253 --> 07:42.505
Well, I think that I understand the people

07:42.588 --> 07:44.799
to whom the New Liberalism
wants to give a voice.

07:44.882 --> 07:49.470
The party clearly needs to hear
what you have to say, Mr. Escobar.

07:50.763 --> 07:53.683
There is a great deal of talk
about how you have made your money.

07:53.766 --> 07:57.311
I need guarantees
concerning the origins of your fortune.

07:59.147 --> 08:02.608
And Valeria told you...
how much I am going to donate?

08:02.692 --> 08:04.610
- No, no--
- Look, I am not a politician.

08:04.694 --> 08:09.615
I am not a successful lawyer like you.
I come from the street... brother.

08:09.699 --> 08:13.828
I want to reassure you
that you will receive your piece.

08:13.911 --> 08:16.247
- It's not about that--
- Assuming your piece is ten percent,

08:16.330 --> 08:17.790
your piece would be what?

08:17.874 --> 08:20.334
Three hundred thousand dollars
just for you.

08:24.755 --> 08:27.675
Does that seem like a sufficient guarantee
for the Justice Minister or what?

08:27.758 --> 08:30.178
- Most definitely.
- All right, then.

08:30.261 --> 08:32.096
Let's go look at the hippos. Come on.

08:34.307 --> 08:35.433
Blackie.

08:36.976 --> 08:38.227
Pablo?

08:39.854 --> 08:42.440
- And what about me?
- What about you?

08:43.858 --> 08:45.359
I don't get my piece?

08:46.194 --> 08:48.279
No, my queen. The thing is that you...

08:49.572 --> 08:51.741
you're in this for love, right?

08:54.660 --> 08:56.204
Look, Minister...

08:57.121 --> 09:00.124
Escobar has founded schools, clinics.

09:00.208 --> 09:02.543
He has created sources of employment
throughout Medellin.

09:02.627 --> 09:05.213
The people love him,
and he loves the people.

09:05.296 --> 09:08.007
And from a legal point of view,
his money is clean.

09:08.090 --> 09:11.802
And according to Forbes Magazine,
he's a drug trafficker.

09:11.886 --> 09:16.057
Are you going to believe all of that
American imperialist propaganda?

09:16.140 --> 09:17.141
Take a look.

09:19.852 --> 09:25.316
These are property holdings papers.

09:25.399 --> 09:26.651
Look.

09:26.734 --> 09:31.322
He's the owner of hundreds of properties
in Colombia and also the United States.

09:32.281 --> 09:34.533
In addition,
this man has no criminal record.

09:34.617 --> 09:37.995
If there was,
there would be proof of his background.

09:43.167 --> 09:44.377
How much is he paying you?

09:46.170 --> 09:48.256
I am thinking about our party, Minister.

09:49.382 --> 09:52.885
Escobar is prepared to contribute
millions of dollars.

09:52.969 --> 09:57.473
We already support Jairo Ortega
so that he can campaign in Antioquia.

09:57.556 --> 10:00.184
Let's let Escobar be his alternate.

10:00.268 --> 10:03.854
What do you prefer...
rumors and insinuations,

10:03.938 --> 10:06.315
or fewer representatives in Congress?

11:47.583 --> 11:49.293
Who is the gringa?

11:49.377 --> 11:51.003
A child of God, just like you.

11:52.046 --> 11:52.880
Got it.

12:00.096 --> 12:02.932
Let's see, you are here for a cat?

12:03.015 --> 12:04.934
This isn't just any cat.

12:05.017 --> 12:06.519
This is a gringo cat of the DEA.

12:09.313 --> 12:12.900
And what you want
is for me to find a cat killer.

12:12.983 --> 12:17.279
It was the narcos, Suárez.
We don't take this shit lightly.

12:19.156 --> 12:20.449
Your friend is a little crazy.

12:22.952 --> 12:24.328
I don't speak English.

12:26.664 --> 12:28.874
Get me some information, Suárez.

12:28.958 --> 12:30.709
Look, I don't have enough people

12:30.793 --> 12:34.797
to go through hundreds of hours
of chatter over a fucking cat.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.674
If this was information
about the narcos, yes.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.592
My people are interested.

12:38.676 --> 12:40.386
But they won't give a fuck about the cat.

12:44.723 --> 12:48.227
But if you want to put
all my people to work

12:48.310 --> 12:53.023
to find out who killed the fucking cat,
that is going to cost you more.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.153
They broke into the house to kill his cat.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.823
I think they made him
when he arrived at the airport in Bogota'.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.116
Find out.

13:14.253 --> 13:19.175
This gentleman is an employee of
the American Embassy in our country,

13:19.258 --> 13:23.179
and he assures me that you gave out his
personal information to certain criminals.

13:24.221 --> 13:25.639
That's not true.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.185
These guys killed his cat.

13:30.186 --> 13:32.438
Maybe you don't know this,
but the mistreatment of animals

13:32.521 --> 13:33.856
is a federal crime.

13:35.483 --> 13:36.484
Is this funny to you?

13:37.359 --> 13:41.864
They can bring formal charges against you,
and you could lose your job.

13:41.947 --> 13:44.742
Do you not need your job, Santiago?

13:45.868 --> 13:46.994
Yes, I need it.

13:57.254 --> 14:00.299
Mr. Murphy, do you recognize these men?

14:06.931 --> 14:08.974
- What?
- May I?

14:09.934 --> 14:12.019
You both are being
accused of conspiring

14:12.102 --> 14:15.105
against a federal agent
of the United States.

14:15.814 --> 14:19.902
The cat is under the jurisdiction
of the American government.

14:19.985 --> 14:22.696
And to kill it is the same
as to kill a police dog.

14:26.075 --> 14:27.535
This is absurd.

14:28.869 --> 14:32.665
Look, I'm a Colombian citizen,
and I know exactly my--

14:33.499 --> 14:35.918
You will not disrespect them!

14:37.253 --> 14:38.712
Is that clear?

14:38.796 --> 14:44.552
If I open my mouth, they kill me,
and they kill my wife.

14:44.635 --> 14:47.054
He's having problems with his wife.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.138
Shut up!

14:49.390 --> 14:51.267
- Imbecile.
- OK, gentlemen.

14:52.184 --> 14:53.769
This is quite simple.

14:55.104 --> 15:01.193
I can get the phone number of the person
to whom you sent those documents,

15:01.277 --> 15:05.948
and I can tell him that you accused him
of being the cat killer.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.533
How does that sound?

15:13.080 --> 15:18.794
I sent a copy of that passport
to a man they call...

15:20.838 --> 15:21.672
"Poison."

15:25.134 --> 15:26.594
OK, Poison.

15:26.677 --> 15:29.888
You're going to take this money
to Fernando Duque in Bogota'.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.765
And this is the address.

15:31.849 --> 15:34.184
If they stop you on the road,
just salute the official,

15:34.268 --> 15:36.729
give them a little bribe
and continue forward.

15:37.521 --> 15:38.772
No violence.

15:38.856 --> 15:40.774
And you call me every two hours.

15:40.858 --> 15:43.152
- Of course, boss. Whatever you say.
- OK, then. No showing off.

15:43.235 --> 15:45.696
No showing off!

15:45.779 --> 15:49.366
- Nice and simple. Go unnoticed.
- Got it.

15:52.369 --> 15:53.537
What the fuck are you doing?

15:55.122 --> 15:56.290
Getting ready, right?

15:56.373 --> 16:00.044
You are meeting up with politicians,
not with gangsters.

16:02.171 --> 16:04.173
Aren't they the same thing, boss?

16:05.966 --> 16:08.218
Politicians scare easily.

16:08.302 --> 16:10.304
You're fine with just a pistol.

16:10.387 --> 16:12.681
Go to it, then. Go to it, dumb-ass.

17:20.958 --> 17:22.835
Hey, hey, hey, hold on. Sixty-five?

17:22.918 --> 17:24.378
Sixty-five.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.588
Hey, brother, that's a lot.

17:26.672 --> 17:28.298
You sure?

17:28.382 --> 17:30.968
I counted every single son of a bitch.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.594
All right!

17:32.678 --> 17:35.264
Sure, but are you counting
what happened last night?

17:35.347 --> 17:37.057
Of course, that was number sixty-five.

17:37.141 --> 17:40.686
Don't bullshit.
I was the one who shot that faggot.

17:40.769 --> 17:43.522
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit...

17:43.605 --> 17:45.399
if I was the one
who killed that little man.

17:45.482 --> 17:48.819
You only shot him
once he was already on the ground, dead.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.696
I shot him first.

17:56.285 --> 17:57.494
Come in.

17:59.163 --> 18:00.914
Did you give information about Poison
to the DEA?

18:00.998 --> 18:02.207
So?

18:02.291 --> 18:04.668
I'm still listening
to their phone conversations

18:04.752 --> 18:06.628
and it's not a shipment of drugs.

18:06.712 --> 18:09.423
They're carrying three million dollars
to Bogota',

18:09.506 --> 18:11.049
and if two guys from the DEA
stop that car,

18:11.133 --> 18:12.843
Pablo is going to hang you by the balls.

18:18.015 --> 18:21.560
- You don't have 65, Poi.
- Yes, I do.

18:26.190 --> 18:27.900
What are you doing, Gonorrhea?!

18:27.983 --> 18:30.235
Look, 65, man!

18:33.947 --> 18:36.283
Now we're going
to have to wash the car, man!

18:36.366 --> 18:38.577
Son of a bitch.

18:39.912 --> 18:40.788
Yes?

18:40.871 --> 18:42.414
<i>Hi, Pablo.
I have good news for you.</i>

18:43.165 --> 18:44.958
I'm going to help you
avoid an enormous loss.

18:45.042 --> 18:46.502
And how much is it going to cost me?

18:47.419 --> 18:50.631
<i>Ten percent.
Three hundred thousand dollars.</i>

18:55.302 --> 18:56.678
How did you find out?

18:56.762 --> 18:57.721
<i>One of your men.</i>

18:57.805 --> 19:01.183
That Poison... he talks too much.

19:01.266 --> 19:03.519
<i>You should take his phone away.</i>

19:03.602 --> 19:04.853
Five percent.

19:10.943 --> 19:12.402
Suspicious vehicle approaching.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.000
Hello?

19:27.084 --> 19:28.544
<i>Poison?</i>

19:28.627 --> 19:31.505
You bring your fucking mouth
back here immediately!

19:31.588 --> 19:34.132
- Yes. I'm sorry, boss.
- Now!

19:36.301 --> 19:38.554
The son of a bitch policeman
tapped my phone!

19:38.637 --> 19:43.058
- These fags.
- You have a very big mouth, Poison.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.726
Pablo is really pissed off.

19:45.602 --> 19:48.856
Shut that mug, or you will never reach 66,
you hear?

20:23.849 --> 20:27.519
He has been called the "Paisa Robin Hood,"
but he is much more than that.

20:27.603 --> 20:30.022
He is a man to whom the people
mean a great deal.

20:30.105 --> 20:31.398
All of us.

20:52.419 --> 20:57.424
I am tired... of the people with power
running this country.

20:57.507 --> 21:03.639
This is a fight between the people
with power and poor people, weak people.

21:04.556 --> 21:07.517
And this fight must begin here.

21:10.729 --> 21:16.693
To have power does not mean
that one can abuse the poor.

21:16.777 --> 21:18.070
If I am elected...

21:18.904 --> 21:22.574
if my friend, Jairo, is elected...

21:22.658 --> 21:26.703
those who have never had a voice
will have a voice.

21:29.289 --> 21:32.834
Those who are hungry will have food.

21:32.918 --> 21:36.338
Those who want to learn will have schools.

21:36.421 --> 21:39.049
And those who have dreams

21:39.132 --> 21:43.720
will see that there are no limits
to what you can achieve.

21:44.888 --> 21:49.309
In me, you have a friend
whom you have always had,

21:49.393 --> 21:53.021
the friend of today, the friend
of yesterday and the friend of tomorrow.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.401
Thank you very much.

22:01.071 --> 22:02.072
Thank you very much.

22:08.370 --> 22:11.248
My friend, Jairo Ortega!

22:22.134 --> 22:23.343
Thank you very much.

22:31.101 --> 22:32.811
- You were marvelous, my love.
- Sure?

22:32.894 --> 22:34.021
Yes.

22:34.104 --> 22:35.105
Very good, Pablo.

22:35.897 --> 22:38.859
There are a few things we can improve,
but we'll work on them.

22:38.942 --> 22:39.860
OK, whatever you say.

22:39.943 --> 22:42.738
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much, Valeria.

22:42.821 --> 22:44.072
Congratulations, ma'am.

22:46.408 --> 22:47.409
Excuse me.

22:58.712 --> 23:02.591
To vote for Jairo Ortega
is to vote for the one and only Pablo!

23:08.972 --> 23:10.140
What's wrong?

23:13.727 --> 23:16.897
Why does that woman need to know
everything about each step you take?

23:16.980 --> 23:18.148
What are you talking about?

23:19.733 --> 23:23.070
- Valeria Velez.
- My love...

23:23.153 --> 23:27.699
She's a newspaper woman,
a reporter, who follows the news.

23:28.950 --> 23:30.577
And right now, I'm the news.

23:31.995 --> 23:36.249
When you win, don't disrespect me
anymore with that bitch.

23:36.333 --> 23:39.086
Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

23:39.169 --> 23:41.213
Slowly. Come on.

23:41.797 --> 23:43.048
Let's go...

23:46.927 --> 23:50.639
You are going to be the First Lady
of this country one of these days.

23:51.431 --> 23:54.810
Therefore, you are going
to have to learn to deal with the press.

23:54.893 --> 23:57.813
That woman is not on your level, Pablo.

23:57.896 --> 23:59.106
She degrades you.

23:59.189 --> 24:01.858
Please, don't worry about Valeria.

24:07.114 --> 24:08.156
Pablo!

24:09.449 --> 24:10.826
A car, please!

24:11.952 --> 24:14.079
A car to the hospital, now!

24:24.548 --> 24:25.507
You know what, Pablo?

24:27.175 --> 24:29.928
To me, it looks like
you are handling things very badly.

24:33.348 --> 24:36.935
You need to start thinking more
about your family... and about business.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.147
Thing is, you can't be a politician.

24:40.939 --> 24:42.190
Says who?

24:44.109 --> 24:47.445
You can't go strutting around
giving things to people

24:47.529 --> 24:49.239
simply so they will love you.

24:51.491 --> 24:54.161
We... are bandits.

24:59.666 --> 25:03.545
If you run for Congress, find someone else
to manage the laboratories.

25:03.628 --> 25:05.046
Señor Escobar?

25:05.922 --> 25:07.799
Come meet your daughter.

25:15.265 --> 25:17.976
God has blessed us with a girl, Pablo.

25:21.521 --> 25:23.481
How beautiful.

25:53.887 --> 25:55.305
Pablo is out of control.

25:58.642 --> 26:01.895
Mother Mary, man.
What do you want us to do?

26:01.978 --> 26:06.358
You can't give Pablo Escobar a spanking
as though he were some spoiled brat.

26:06.441 --> 26:07.651
Oh, no?

26:08.526 --> 26:09.653
And why not?

26:09.736 --> 26:12.489
Careful with the threat
you cannot execute.

26:17.953 --> 26:19.913
You know what he's doing, right?

26:19.996 --> 26:25.001
According to Colombian law,
a congressman has total immunity.

26:25.085 --> 26:29.297
Do you think he's protecting himself
while we remain in the drift?

26:29.381 --> 26:32.634
I do. He thinks he's that fucking
"Paisa Robin Hood."

26:32.717 --> 26:34.803
So what do we do?

26:34.886 --> 26:36.137
Well...

26:36.221 --> 26:40.183
we fulfill our duties,
stuffing the ballot box,

26:40.267 --> 26:45.313
and later we let Pablo receive
the applause, and take the risk.

26:45.397 --> 26:50.860
We continue with our business...
in the shadows, like always.

26:52.862 --> 26:54.906
Carlos, what are the guys saying?

26:56.366 --> 26:58.743
I imagine that they're worried, right?

26:58.827 --> 27:01.413
They are not politically conscious,
brother.

27:04.916 --> 27:07.585
How can you expect them
to understand your objectives?

27:11.798 --> 27:13.717
You do understand me, brother.

27:16.052 --> 27:19.723
Imagine... a state governed by us.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.350
Immunity for everyone, brother.

27:23.226 --> 27:26.187
We, Carlos, belong to the people.

27:26.271 --> 27:29.524
I need you to use your influence with the
others to convince them that I am right.

27:29.607 --> 27:31.651
If you win,
you don't need to explain anything.

27:32.569 --> 27:35.530
And if you lose...
there's nothing to explain.

27:35.613 --> 27:36.948
I like that.

27:38.491 --> 27:40.535
- Hitler said it.
- Fuck off.

27:40.618 --> 27:42.203
Yes.

27:42.287 --> 27:43.872
He also said that no politician

27:43.955 --> 27:47.292
should ever let his picture
be taken in a bathing suit.

28:08.229 --> 28:09.481
Well, that's what he said.

28:13.568 --> 28:15.070
And if I tell you, Carlos...

28:16.404 --> 28:19.824
that what I want, sincerely...

28:21.076 --> 28:23.244
is to help the poor people
of this country...

28:24.996 --> 28:26.331
do you believe me or what?

29:28.101 --> 29:32.939
As soon as the results come out,
Jairo Ortega will resign.

29:33.022 --> 29:36.317
I say he's running toward his death.

30:40.089 --> 30:43.134
- Sixty-six.
- Bullshit. I shot him first.

32:19.314 --> 32:24.277
Ladies and gentlemen, with clear use
of my mental and physical faculties...

32:25.194 --> 32:28.323
I wish to communicate to you my decision

32:28.406 --> 32:32.160
to resign from my seat
in the Congress of the Republic...

32:33.202 --> 32:35.872
for reasons of family and health.

32:35.955 --> 32:40.168
But I am completely certain that
my friend Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria

32:40.251 --> 32:44.172
is going to continue
our social and political ideas,

32:44.255 --> 32:48.134
because Pablo is the voice of the people.
Thank you very much.

32:48.217 --> 32:49.218
Thank you very much, Jairo.

32:49.302 --> 32:51.971
I will give my best effort.
Thank you very much.

32:52.055 --> 32:58.269
<i>Oh, unfading glory!
Oh, immortal jubilee!</i>

34:32.155 --> 34:33.990
Congressman Escobar...

34:34.073 --> 34:35.658
Sir!

34:35.742 --> 34:37.326
Excuse me.

34:37.410 --> 34:39.954
Allow me to remind you
of the norms of etiquette.

34:40.037 --> 34:42.290
You cannot enter the hall
if you don't have a tie.

34:45.293 --> 34:46.502
All right.

34:46.586 --> 34:48.963
- What is your name?
- Juan.

34:49.046 --> 34:50.631
Look,Juan“.

34:51.674 --> 34:54.510
That is a really nice tie.

34:54.594 --> 34:56.053
- My girlfriend gave it to me.
- Really?

34:56.137 --> 34:57.472
Yes.

34:57.555 --> 35:01.142
Well, she's in the history books now.

35:02.018 --> 35:03.811
- Thank you very much, my son.
- Thank you, sir.

35:03.895 --> 35:05.229
- Thank you.
- All right.

35:28.544 --> 35:30.254
Good morning.

35:32.006 --> 35:35.176
I inform you we have a quorum
to begin our session.

35:37.929 --> 35:43.184
The Minister of Justice, Rodrigo
Lara Bonilla, is present here today

35:43.267 --> 35:46.103
to address this honorable Congress.

35:46.187 --> 35:49.774
I give the floor to you, Mr. Minister.

35:49.857 --> 35:51.275
Thank you very much.

35:56.155 --> 36:00.993
Much has been made
of the issue of drug money,

36:01.077 --> 36:06.624
"hot money,"
in our national political process.

36:06.707 --> 36:11.587
I myself have been accused
of receiving campaign contributions

36:11.671 --> 36:15.383
from the narcotics traffickers
who have bought influence in these halls.

36:20.471 --> 36:23.015
To this charge, I plead guilty.

36:25.476 --> 36:29.230
In my eyes, the sin of turning a blind eye

36:29.313 --> 36:31.649
is as great <i>as</i> the sin
of outright corruption.

36:31.732 --> 36:35.444
We are a nation of the blind,
and in our blindness,

36:35.528 --> 36:38.573
we have sold our country
to the highest bidder.

36:41.450 --> 36:43.995
It's time for us to open our eyes
and to see the light.

36:51.168 --> 36:52.753
Congressman Escobar...

36:54.130 --> 36:58.134
you stated that your great fortune
was built from a taxi company.

37:00.678 --> 37:04.473
This photograph clearly
contradicts your claim.

37:05.683 --> 37:07.768
For this reason,
I demand your resignation.

37:07.852 --> 37:10.021
You are not welcome in this chamber.

37:11.314 --> 37:12.398
You don't belong here.

37:58.611 --> 38:01.280
Thank you very much, Juan.
Very kind.

38:01.364 --> 38:06.702
<i>What interests the narcos isn't
just the fall of the Minister of Justice,</i>

38:06.786 --> 38:10.706
but also to impede the strategy
of the government to combat his interests.

38:11.540 --> 38:14.669
His two arms: silver or lead.

38:14.752 --> 38:20.967
I want to inform the people that
the Minister of Justice has 24 hours

38:21.050 --> 38:24.845
within which to present concrete proof
regarding the insinuations he made

38:24.929 --> 38:27.890
the day before yesterday
in the Hall of Representatives.

38:27.974 --> 38:32.144
To the contrary, I will proceed
to denounce him legally

38:32.228 --> 38:35.022
before the authorities
and before the Colombian justice system.

38:40.194 --> 38:44.407
<i>I am not looking for, nor do I long for a
confrontation before the Colombian people.</i>

38:44.490 --> 38:47.994
I look for peace,
I have always preached peace,

38:48.077 --> 38:51.998
and have longed for peace and
the prosperity of the Colombian people.

38:52.081 --> 38:55.626
<i>It's important to realize
that when members of Congress</i>

38:55.710 --> 38:58.754
<i>can be threatened or bought at will,</i>

38:58.838 --> 39:03.300
we see with clarity the real dimension
of the drug problem here in Colombia.

39:45.509 --> 39:47.470
<i>What are required are honest men,</i>

39:47.553 --> 39:52.224
men who are able to put themselves
up against drug traffickers,

39:52.308 --> 39:59.190
who with complete tranquility buy or kill
any person or government institution

39:59.273 --> 40:01.067
who is against their interests.

41:50.176 --> 41:55.097
Oh, Pablito. We knew
they wouldn't accept you in that circle.

41:58.267 --> 42:00.019
Damned bastards.

42:06.358 --> 42:08.819
You're too good for them, Pablito.

42:31.675 --> 42:34.386
This is a fight
that you cannot win, cousin.

42:37.056 --> 42:40.434
You need to think more
about your family and the business...

42:43.145 --> 42:44.980
and abandon that ridiculousness
once and for all.

42:51.028 --> 42:52.571
I Will fix it.

43:03.040 --> 43:07.795
Due to the vicious lies
and slander cast my way

43:07.878 --> 43:11.173
by Minister Lara and his cronies,

43:11.257 --> 43:14.885
I've decided to announce my resignation
from Congress of the Republic.

43:17.054 --> 43:20.557
<i>I ran as a representative
for the common man,</i>

43:20.641 --> 43:23.519
<i>a voice for those who had no voice,</i>

43:23.602 --> 43:26.981
but that has happened
through much of our history.

43:27.064 --> 43:31.318
<i>The powerful have conspired to silence me.</i>

43:31.986 --> 43:33.862
I dreamt of doing good.

43:35.614 --> 43:37.366
Those dreams are over.

43:39.201 --> 43:44.290
But make no mistake...
I will not go quietly.

43:45.291 --> 43:46.667
<i>I Will fight.</i>

43:47.334 --> 43:50.004
<i>"The Men of Always" are mistaken</i>

43:50.087 --> 43:54.383
if they think they can defeat
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria!

44:05.561 --> 44:06.729
Thank you very much.

45:06.121 --> 45:08.165
I brought this for your friend's wife.

45:10.709 --> 45:12.211
- I hope she likes it.
- No, gracias.

45:12.294 --> 45:13.504
You're fucking crazy, asshole.
