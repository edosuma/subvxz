Good morning, everyone.

00:08.011 --> 00:09.136
[Finley]
I fudged the priest.

00:09.136 --> 00:10.553

I don't know

00:10.553 --> 00:12.261
what you believe in,

00:12.261 --> 00:14.887
but I think that
we met for a reason.

00:14.887 --> 00:16.887
[Lena]
Tess, she's good with people...

00:16.887 --> 00:18.387
not always with me.

00:19.595 --> 00:20.887
Hey, hi.

00:20.887 --> 00:22.345
I'm really sorry.

00:22.345 --> 00:23.220
I have to cancel.

00:26.887 --> 00:27.720
How's wedding planning coming?

00:27.720 --> 00:29.679
I made a call and scheduled

00:29.679 --> 00:31.136
us a tour of the Biltmore.

[Sophie]
I don't want to feel

00:32.720 --> 00:34.929
uncomfortable at my own wedding.

00:34.929 --> 00:37.095
Couples compromise all the time.

00:37.095 --> 00:38.470
Yeah, I'm happy
to compromise with you.

00:38.470 --> 00:39.553
I'm just not about
to compromise

00:39.553 --> 00:40.887
with your dad.

How does sleeping

00:42.345 --> 00:44.053
with Felicity Adams make you

00:44.053 --> 00:46.011
qualified to be the mayor?

00:46.011 --> 00:47.553
You still don't know
why she's running, do you?

00:47.553 --> 00:49.970
No, I guess I don't.

[Bette]
Are you sure that it's over?

I have divorce papers

Why are you hanging out

00:58.553 --> 00:59.762

-Okay.

so much for this.
