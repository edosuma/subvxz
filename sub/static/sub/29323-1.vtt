01:56.316 --> 01:58.190
He salivates when he looks at you.

01:58.358 --> 02:00.150
- (laughs)
- (Carly) He's besotted.

02:00.319 --> 02:01.777
And he's a catch.

02:01.945 --> 02:04.566
He's 40. He's ready to settle down.

02:04.990 --> 02:06.697
And he's a lawyer.

02:06.866 --> 02:09.191

Oh, shut up!

02:17.083 --> 02:18.708
I think you should go on a date with him.

- Con she  just sleep with him?

(Carly)
Ah! I suppose so.

02:24.672 --> 02:27.591
- (fireworks fizzing outside)
- I think I  just want a wedding.

02:27.758 --> 02:30.428
I'm trying to manipulate you
into becoming my sister-in-law.

02:30.595 --> 02:33.464
- I am already your sister.
- OK, well, fuck him, then.

02:33.638 --> 02:34.754
Enjoy.

02:34.931 --> 02:39.427
But  just send him a little text message
afterwards saying he's got a massive cock.

02:39.602 --> 02:42.223
-  just so his ego isn't bruised.
- (laughter)

02:42.396 --> 02:44.388

- No, you are not breaking up the party!

02:55.282 --> 02:59.327
- Actually, I'm going with you.
- No, no, no, Elena. You are not going.

02:59.494 --> 03:00.952
Why is everyone going?

03:01.120 --> 03:02.697
<i>(Carly)
Are you sure you don't wanna stay?</i>

03:02.871 --> 03:06.288
I’ll  just kick Shane onto the sofa

04:02.171 --> 04:03.880
OK. Whatever.

04:04.049 --> 04:05.923
Have a happy New Year.

04:06.091 --> 04:07.966
He saw me first  just for you to know.

04:18.101 --> 04:20.510
I was  just gonna ask
if you had a nice New Year.

04:20.688 --> 04:22.644
Yeah, thank you.

04:23.314 --> 04:24.857
Er...l went to a friend's house,

04:25.025 --> 04:27.812
<i>and we  just basically got drunk,
so it was fun.</i>

04:28.735 --> 04:30.112
How about yours?

04:30.279 --> 04:33.114
I was DJ-ing so I had to stay sober.

04:35.033 --> 04:38.568
<i>I didn't know you had to stay sober
if you were a DJ. You  just do like...</i>

04:38.744 --> 04:41.117
Like this and this.

04:42.206 --> 04:44.495
There's actually a lot more to it
than meets the eye.

04:44.666 --> 04:46.493
- There is a lot to coordinate.
- Really?

04:46.668 --> 04:48.494
- Yeah.
- Like what?

04:48.669 --> 04:50.544
<i>Like... I mean, there's...</i>

04:50.713 --> 04:51.959
(he laughs)

04:52.131 --> 04:55.629
There's the tracks and level and...

04:55.800 --> 04:57.259
<i>OK.</i>

05:03.224 --> 05:05.133
Are you a good DJ?

05:05.308 --> 05:06.969
I dunno.

05:08.436 --> 05:10.428
I'm Jake, by the way.

05:12.690 --> 05:14.516
Do you mind opening the window?

05:14.691 --> 05:16.684
Yeah, sure.

05:20.030 --> 05:21.904
I think I'm feeling sick.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.567
S-Sorry?

05:23.740 --> 05:25.366
I'm feeling sick.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.490
Are you actually gonna be sick?

05:29.287 --> 05:31.955
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna be sick.
- Excuse me, mate?

05:39.003 --> 05:40.878
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

05:41.046 --> 05:43.716
<i>If you  just, erm...
stick your fingers down your throat...</i>

05:43.882 --> 05:47.833
Like, it always helps me. You  just get it
all out and you'll feel better.

05:48.011 --> 05:49.921
Yeah, but, no, it doesn't work with me.

05:50.097 --> 05:52.587
<i>- I tried before, and...
- OK.</i>

05:52.765 --> 05:55.007
<i>I think I’m  just go...
I'm gonna walk home.</i>

05:55.184 --> 05:57.058
<i>Like, the fresh air, it's...</i>

05:57.227 --> 05:58.389
- OK.
- ...good.

05:58.562 --> 06:00.685
- Will you be all right on your own?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:00.855 --> 06:03.015
- I  just need to walk.
- You don't want me to walk with you?

06:03.191 --> 06:05.396
- No, it's fine. Thank you so much.
- Are you sure?

06:05.567 --> 06:07.478
No, no, no.
Thank you, it's fine. It's OK.

06:07.653 --> 06:10.108
Uh...thank you,
and I'm sorry about before.

- I'm sorry.
- OK.

Happy New Year.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.118
Yeah, Happy New Year.

06:53.399 --> 06:55.357
(door opens)

06:59.238 --> 07:01.812
- This is a really nice apartment.
- Thank you.

07:02.950 --> 07:06.033
<i>Hove you got it all to yourself, or...
have you got flat mates?</i>

07:06.202 --> 07:08.077
Oh, no, no, ifs  just me.

07:08.246 --> 07:09.906
Cool.

07:12.041 --> 07:13.915
How long have you been here?

07:14.083 --> 07:15.911
Like, ten years, maybe?

07:16.086 --> 07:17.829
- Ten years? Wow.
- Yeah.

07:18.004 --> 07:20.839
I rented it, and then the owner died,
so I bought it.

07:21.757 --> 07:23.547
So, how old are you?

07:24.426 --> 07:26.003
How old are you?

07:26.511 --> 07:29.346
- 26.
- OK. How old do you think I am?

07:30.556 --> 07:33.261
My age? Or maybe...older?

07:33.434 --> 07:34.809
Er...28?

07:34.976 --> 07:36.851
- 29?
- 29's good.

07:37.020 --> 07:38.894
Good. Good for what?

07:39.063 --> 07:40.474
- For nothing.
- For nothing?

07:40.647 --> 07:42.854
<i>- Sorry. I meant...
- It's no... not nice?</i>

07:43.025 --> 07:47.189
Erm...l read recently that women
are in their sexual peck in their 30s.

07:47.529 --> 07:49.023
Whoa!

07:49.196 --> 07:51.071
Apparently. I don't know...
(chuckles)

07:51.240 --> 07:53.696
- I'm there.
- Sorry, I don't know.

07:54.326 --> 07:56.485
You've got a wicked record collection.

07:58.413 --> 08:00.370
Erm...it was my dad's collection.

08:01.332 --> 08:03.242
He's a musician.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.414
He's got great taste.

08:09.589 --> 08:12.840
<i>Yeah, it's...
it's his one good quality, actually.</i>

08:16.220 --> 08:18.046
I love this album.

08:18.221 --> 08:19.717
<i>Mm.</i>

08:25.769 --> 08:27.727
- I need to go to the toilet.
- OK.

08:34.527 --> 08:36.484

ELVIS COSTELLO AND THE ATTRACTIONS:
"I Want You"

08:56.337 --> 09:02.257
I want you so it scares me to death

09:02.509 --> 09:08.629
I can't say any more than I love you

09:09.598 --> 09:14.093
Everything else is a waste of breath...

09:15.687 --> 09:17.845
Jake! You're waking my neighbours.

09:18.021 --> 09:19.979
- You don't care?
- No.

09:20.149 --> 09:21.311
<i>OK.</i>

09:21.483 --> 09:23.358
You know this isn't a love song?

09:23.527 --> 09:27.227
It's about him
being cheated on by his girlfriend and...

09:27.405 --> 09:29.279
and he can't forgive her.

09:29.448 --> 09:33.778
And then the memory  just
keeps, like, coming back to haunt him.

09:34.869 --> 09:36.246
Poor Elvis.

09:37.497 --> 09:39.453
- It's a wicked song, though.
- Yeah.

09:39.623 --> 09:42.874
I ...you might fall

09:45.337 --> 09:47.293
I want you

09:48.088 --> 09:52.833
I woke up and one of us was crying

09:53.677 --> 09:55.421
I want you

09:55.595 --> 10:00.637
You said,
"Young man, I do believe you're dying"

10:00.808 --> 10:02.765
- (she laughs)
- I want you

10:03.644 --> 10:09.017
If you need a second opinion,
as you seem to do these days

10:09.190 --> 10:11.100
I want you

10:11.275 --> 10:17.775
You can look in my eyes
and you can count the ways

10:24.536 --> 10:26.031
I want you

10:27.038 --> 10:31.700
Did you mean to tell me
but seem to forget?

10:32.585 --> 10:34.494
I want you

10:34.670 --> 10:39.628
Since when were you so generous
and inarticulate?

10:40.550 --> 10:42.045
I want you

10:42.218 --> 10:48.089
It's knowing that he knows you now
after only guessing

10:49.891 --> 10:53.308
It's the thought of him undressing you

10:53.478 --> 10:57.262
Or you undressing

11:00.191 --> 11:01.852
(Punting)

11:08.365 --> 11:10.322
I want you

11:11.993 --> 11:13.653
(she moans softly)

11:15.705 --> 11:17.579
I want you

11:19.958 --> 11:21.950
(heavy breathing)

11:23.586 --> 11:27.632
I want you

11:30.425 --> 11:32.382
(she grunts)

11:35.262 --> 11:36.721
(Jake)
Morning.

11:36.889 --> 11:38.347

11:43.144 --> 11:45.101
I'm hungover.

11:47.147 --> 11:49.058
- You want some coffee?
- Oh, yeah, I'd love one.

11:49.233 --> 11:51.308
- Black coffee?
- Yeah, that's fine.

11:54.737 --> 11:56.695
Have you got a busy day
ahead, or...?

11:56.865 --> 11:58.821
- Hmm, yeah.
- Uh-huh.

12:00.659 --> 12:02.154
Thanks.

12:02.953 --> 12:04.827
I have some work to do.

12:04.996 --> 12:06.657
- Shit.
- Yeah.

12:06.831 --> 12:08.538
When do you go back?

12:08.707 --> 12:10.499
Wednesday.

12:13.086 --> 12:15.043
And back to reality, yeah?

12:16.047 --> 12:18.003
(whispers) Back to reality.

12:20.509 --> 12:22.134
So, er...last night was fun.

12:22.303 --> 12:24.177
Mm-hm. Yeah.

12:24.346 --> 12:25.840
Oh, yeah.

12:26.013 --> 12:27.805
All right.

12:29.725 --> 12:31.600
<i>- Yeah.

12:31.769 --> 12:33.513
All right.

14:19.193 --> 14:20.770
<i>(Jake)
I like all your stuff.</i>

14:22.029 --> 14:23.985
It's like a proper home.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.739
What are you doing now?

14:29.368 --> 14:31.325
<i>Hmm...l could go.</i>

14:32.120 --> 14:33.994
Or I could stay, it's up to you.

14:34.163 --> 14:36.121
- Whatever you want.
- Up to you.

14:40.878 --> 14:43.499
I mean, it looks quite cold outside.

Stay, stay, stay, stay.

15:07.442 --> 15:09.068
Stay!

15:12.321 --> 15:14.278
(children playing in distance)

15:35.966 --> 15:38.635
<i>(Carly) I want all the details.
I want to know everything.</i>

15:38.802 --> 15:40.676
He's  just a really nice guy.

15:40.845 --> 15:42.470
What does he do?

15:42.638 --> 15:44.264
He's doing a PhD.

15:44.432 --> 15:46.306
How old is he?

15:46.474 --> 15:50.425
- 26.
- (chuckles) Wow. Fantastic!

15:50.603 --> 15:53.473
Imaginary jealous.
So, the sex is fucking amazing?

15:53.647 --> 15:54.726
(giggles)

15:54.898 --> 15:57.817
So, is it  just, like,
a casual thing, or...?

15:58.485 --> 16:00.609
Actually, he's about to move in
with me.

16:00.779 --> 16:02.653
(Punting) Oh, my God. Really?

16:02.822 --> 16:04.779
- Yeah.
- How come?

16:05.491 --> 16:08.029
Because he stayed over
and he hasn't left yet, really,

16:08.201 --> 16:10.775
so we're gonna get his stuff this weekend.

16:10.954 --> 16:12.448
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

16:12.622 --> 16:15.112
This is amazing. This is fantastic news!

16:15.291 --> 16:16.667
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:16.833 --> 16:18.542
I can't wait to meet him.

16:18.710 --> 16:20.667
- I'll bring him over.
- Yes, please.

16:20.837 --> 16:23.210
- OK.
- Does he mind being with an older woman?

16:23.381 --> 16:25.255
No, he doesn't care.

16:25.425 --> 16:26.836
<i>OK.</i>

16:27.843 --> 16:29.634
- (key turns in lock)
- (Jake) For fuck's sake.

16:29.804 --> 16:30.966
What?

16:34.599 --> 16:35.975
<i>- Hi.
- (Jake) Hey.</i>

16:36.142 --> 16:39.060
I've been texting you, you git.
Where have you been?

16:40.979 --> 16:43.553
Is there something wrong with the lock?
I couldn't get my key in.

16:43.732 --> 16:45.937
Yeah, it's Glynne, the fuckwit.
He locked us out.

16:46.108 --> 16:48.066
Hey, man, how's it hanging?

16:48.235 --> 16:50.608
Yeah, sorry. Elena, Glynne.
Glynne, Elena.

16:50.779 --> 16:52.689
- Hi.
- Er...and this is Zoe.

16:52.864 --> 16:53.861
<i>Hi.</i>

16:54.032 --> 16:55.942
(Glynne)
You're  just here to collect your stuff?

16:56.117 --> 16:57.991
Yeah, yeah.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.192
<i>Erm...</i>

16:59.369 --> 17:04.244
And...all of this are things
you have in the world?

17:04.915 --> 17:06.328
<i>Mm.</i>

17:06.501 --> 17:09.040
I like to be able to fit my life
into a suitcase.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.040
Do you play the guitar?

17:13.214 --> 17:14.710
I'm not very good.

17:14.883 --> 17:16.542
- Show me.

17:16.718 --> 17:17.999
- Entertain me.
- No.

17:18.176 --> 17:20.134
- Please?
- OK.

17:25.392 --> 17:27.183
- We're very excited.
- OK.

17:27.352 --> 17:30.187
I'm not very good at finger-picking
cos I've got fat fingers.

17:30.354 --> 17:32.311
(strums notes)

17:41.655 --> 17:43.612
(knocking at door)

17:47.035 --> 17:48.992
(knocking at door persists)

17:49.870 --> 17:51.828
- Er...come in.
- (door opens)

17:53.082 --> 17:56.333
Erm...you left these in my room.

17:58.961 --> 18:00.457
Thanks.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.635
(door closes)

18:09.804 --> 18:11.761
Er...we should get packing.

18:14.016 --> 18:15.427
Let's do it.

18:20.563 --> 18:22.022
OK, you're on T-shirts.

18:22.190 --> 18:24.146
So, when did it stop?

18:26.193 --> 18:28.150
Elena, it never started.

18:30.947 --> 18:32.821
What?

18:32.990 --> 18:35.197
Maybe you shouldn't be doing this, Joke.

18:36.326 --> 18:37.607
What do you mean?

18:37.787 --> 18:40.538
Maybe you're not ready
for a proper relationship.

18:40.705 --> 18:42.912
- What do you mean? That's stupid.
- ls it?

18:43.083 --> 18:44.494
- Yes.
- ls it?

18:44.667 --> 18:46.624
That's very, very stupid.

18:51.089 --> 18:52.916
Not coming. I'm not coming.

18:53.091 --> 18:55.048
Look what I'm doing.

18:58.970 --> 19:00.548
(they chuckle)

19:02.432 --> 19:04.389
<i>(he sighs)</i>

19:09.938 --> 19:11.896
Your dad looks so nice.

19:13.316 --> 19:15.190
I can't wait for you to meet him.

19:15.359 --> 19:17.234
He's gonna love you.

19:17.403 --> 19:19.360
Do you think so?

19:22.866 --> 19:24.859
Your mum was beautiful.

19:27.828 --> 19:30.782
My parents, they were crazy.
They were like children.

19:30.956 --> 19:33.874
I had to put them in different rooms
so they wouldn't fight.

19:36.294 --> 19:38.038
My dad was having affairs all the time,

19:38.213 --> 19:41.498
and my mum was just pretending
like nothing was happening.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.126
Sounds shitty.

19:44.301 --> 19:46.970
I don't see why anyone
would want to get married.

19:51.182 --> 19:53.138
How old are you here?

19:56.978 --> 19:58.935
- I think eight.
- Eight?

20:00.148 --> 20:01.773
Eight.

20:06.152 --> 20:08.063
(whispers) Jake.

20:09.030 --> 20:10.856
(he whispers) Elena.

20:11.031 --> 20:12.989
(whispers) I have a confession.

20:17.996 --> 20:19.905
(whispers) What is it?

20:20.081 --> 20:21.457
Nothing.

20:23.625 --> 20:25.583
just cos you said confession.

20:27.087 --> 20:28.914
So now I have to hear it.

20:29.089 --> 20:31.164
<i>- It's no...
- Yeah, you have to tell me.</i>

20:31.340 --> 20:33.215
You're gonna have to tell me now.

20:33.384 --> 20:35.341
Don't you dare use the photos.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.678
They are memories, not weapons.

20:38.847 --> 20:40.803
Give it here. Give it back.

20:42.183 --> 20:44.258
Tell me. Confess. You have to confess.

20:45.018 --> 20:46.976
(muffled) You have to confess!

20:50.440 --> 20:52.314
- (chuckles)
- I will tickle!

20:52.483 --> 20:54.060
- (shrieks)
- Tell me!

20:54.235 --> 20:55.611
Tell me!

20:57.821 --> 20:59.566
(squealing and laughter)

20:59.740 --> 21:02.824
- Not telling you anything!
- (laughs) You have to tell me!

21:02.993 --> 21:04.736
- You have to.
- (panting)

21:06.286 --> 21:09.288
<i>What...
What if I am a little bit older than...</i>

21:10.915 --> 21:12.872
...than I said I was?

21:15.920 --> 21:17.664
What do you mean?

21:17.838 --> 21:19.795
Like I'm not 29.

21:24.719 --> 21:26.676
How old are you?

21:29.223 --> 21:30.848
<i>32.</i>

21:34.686 --> 21:37.355
- You're 32?
- Mm-hm.

21:43.776 --> 21:45.734
(he exhales heavily)

21:48.655 --> 21:50.068
(sighs)

21:58.581 --> 22:00.455
I000

22:00.624 --> 22:02.581
I don't care.

22:04.336 --> 22:06.292
I don't care how old you are.

22:07.714 --> 22:09.670
You're gorgeous.

22:18.264 --> 22:20.091
<i>OK.</i>

22:25.437 --> 22:27.761
(Elena whispers) Jake?

22:32.443 --> 22:33.689
<i>Jake...</i>

22:41.034 --> 22:46.193
(whispers) Jake, what if I was
a little bit older than 32?

22:50.041 --> 22:51.452
<i>Like...</i>

22:51.626 --> 22:53.583
33?

22:58.590 --> 23:00.546
<i>Or four... 34?</i>

23:02.468 --> 23:04.045
Or 35?

23:15.980 --> 23:17.356
(Jake grunts)

23:20.942 --> 23:22.816
OK, how old are you?

23:22.985 --> 23:24.942
(she chuckles)

23:27.447 --> 23:29.440
You're freaked out, right?

23:32.869 --> 23:34.825
<i>I'm not freaked out. It’s  just...</i>

23:35.371 --> 23:40.245
you've aged six years in,
like, four hours.

23:41.418 --> 23:43.374
It's quite unusual.

23:51.176 --> 23:53.132
So, what now?

23:54.012 --> 23:55.756
<i>(he sighs)</i>

23:56.597 --> 23:58.424
What do you mean?

24:03.270 --> 24:06.307
I'm gonna be 4O when you are 30.

24:09.858 --> 24:11.317
So?

24:13.861 --> 24:18.072
So, you don't wanna be
with a 40-year-old woman

24:18.240 --> 24:20.861
when you are  just 30.

24:22.577 --> 24:25.116
Why not? I think you'll be incredible
when you're 40.

24:25.288 --> 24:27.114
It's not about me. It's about you.

24:27.289 --> 24:30.658
You are going to want to fuck
25-year-old girls.

24:34.212 --> 24:37.166
So...what are you saying?

24:38.132 --> 24:39.413
Nothing.

24:40.676 --> 24:42.384
Are you saying you wanna break up with me?

24:42.553 --> 24:46.005
<i>No. I'm saying if you want
to break up with me...</i>

24:48.390 --> 24:49.850
<i>...l get it.</i>

25:05.155 --> 25:07.729
I couldn't break up with you
even if I wanted to.

25:11.327 --> 25:13.283
We were made for each other.

25:15.956 --> 25:18.161
<i>- I mean, like, literally...
- (sniffs)</i>

25:20.210 --> 25:21.704
<i>...our parents met...</i>

25:23.754 --> 25:25.580
<i>...and then they had us...</i>

25:26.631 --> 25:28.588
...and then we met.

25:31.051 --> 25:33.009
We were made for each other.

25:35.430 --> 25:37.423
You're everything I've ever wanted.

25:40.268 --> 25:41.763
(she sniffs)

25:47.232 --> 25:49.392
I ELEANORJANES AND AMANDA COOK:
"El Vito"

26:09.459 --> 26:10.788
Whoop!

26:10.961 --> 26:12.835
<i>' (Jake) Sorry.
' (baby cries)</i>

26:13.963 --> 26:16.122
Jake, do you wanna go and sit down there?

26:16.298 --> 26:18.255
(overlapping chatter)

26:20.010 --> 26:22.085
You know what? I mean, he's sleeping...

26:22.261 --> 26:24.136
He's waking up.

26:24.305 --> 26:25.681
Not decided yet.

26:25.848 --> 26:27.889
- (Mark) I made the pie.
- (Carly) I can't take any credit for this.

26:28.059 --> 26:30.846
- (Mark) Spent all day.
- (Jake) Yeah, it's my final year, yeah.

26:31.019 --> 26:33.640
And then what, do you look for a job?

26:33.813 --> 26:35.937
What kind of job would you like, ideally?

26:36.107 --> 26:38.099
- Like, dream job?
- God...

26:38.275 --> 26:40.233
Does it feel like you're talking
to your in-laws?

26:40.402 --> 26:43.320
- No, were  just interested.
- There's various options, really.

26:43.488 --> 26:45.528
Can you be a marine biologist in Glasgow?

26:45.698 --> 26:49.483
(Mark) Carly, I think the idea's to be
out at sea, not stuck in an office.

26:49.660 --> 26:51.570
(Carly)
Oh, I don't know.

26:51.745 --> 26:55.362
<i>(Jake) The most exciting sort of jobs
are in New Zealand and Canada.</i>

26:55.540 --> 26:58.292
(Mark) Ah, right.
So you're going to emigrate, then?

26:58.459 --> 27:00.451
Yeah, maybe. I don't know, actually.

27:01.128 --> 27:03.536
And have you discussed this
with Elena yet?

27:04.255 --> 27:05.751
No, not yet.

27:05.924 --> 27:07.003
(chuckling)

27:07.175 --> 27:09.215
<i>(Jake) I play football.
Once a week, usually.</i>

27:09.384 --> 27:12.504
You should make it twice. No, infect,
three times whilst you still can.

27:12.679 --> 27:16.511
- Whilst you've got the knees that work.
- You sound like such on old man.

27:16.683 --> 27:18.723
Connor, we are old. We're middle-aged.

27:18.893 --> 27:20.518
It's all downhill from here.

27:22.688 --> 27:24.230
(Jake)
Guys, top up? Top up?

27:24.398 --> 27:27.186
(Woman) ...after Ella Rose,
it was a nightmare for me.

27:27.359 --> 27:28.900
(overlapping conversations)

27:31.362 --> 27:34.066
(Carly)
Jake. Jake,  just leave those, seriously.

27:34.239 --> 27:36.031
- Mark will do it.
- It's cool, it's cool.

27:36.199 --> 27:38.191
(Mark)
He needs to burn off the energy.

27:38.367 --> 27:41.452
Maybe you should go
and burn off some energy.

27:42.037 --> 27:44.162
- He's a guest.
- Can you take him?

27:49.335 --> 27:50.747
Shall we go?

27:50.920 --> 27:52.462
Why do you wanna go?

27:52.630 --> 27:54.504
It's a little bit weird.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.548
Is it weird?

27:56.717 --> 27:58.673
A bit grown-up.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.507
I am a grown-up.

28:06.350 --> 28:07.891
(footsteps approaching)

28:08.059 --> 28:09.934
(Mark) Hey, guys, get a room]

28:10.103 --> 28:12.060
Jesus! I make my sandwiches in there.

28:12.229 --> 28:13.642
(she laughs)

28:13.815 --> 28:16.305
<i>- (Elena) What are you thinking?
- (Jake) Nothing.</i>

28:20.361 --> 28:22.070
<i>OK.</i>

28:23.698 --> 28:25.654
I was  just... I was thinking...

28:27.576 --> 28:29.283
...we should  just... just do it.

28:31.580 --> 28:33.454
Do what?

28:33.623 --> 28:35.450
Have a baby. You and me.

28:35.625 --> 28:37.285
Why not?

28:39.086 --> 28:40.497
Are you being funny?

28:41.338 --> 28:43.294
<i>I'm not. I'm... I'm being serious.</i>

28:43.465 --> 28:45.291
Let's make a family.

28:45.466 --> 28:47.422
I think we'd make a beautiful baby.

28:53.515 --> 28:54.926
We hardly know each other.

28:55.099 --> 28:56.974
I don't think that matters.

28:57.143 --> 28:58.388
I think...

28:59.561 --> 29:01.187
I think, why not?

29:01.355 --> 29:03.311
There aren't any rules, are there?

29:05.150 --> 29:07.474
Well, you are 26.

29:08.318 --> 29:09.896
And?

29:12.280 --> 29:14.238
Are you being serious?

29:15.783 --> 29:17.360
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:19.203 --> 29:20.614
<i>Yes.</i>

29:22.289 --> 29:23.950
What are you doing, Mrs. Robinson?

29:24.124 --> 29:25.665
(whispers) Nothing.

29:25.833 --> 29:27.790
- Nothing?
- Uh-uh.

29:29.420 --> 29:33.833
just cos it seems like
you're trying to seduce me.

29:34.007 --> 29:35.466
I am not.

29:35.634 --> 29:37.590
- No?
- Uh-uh.

29:40.596 --> 29:42.256
That's weird.

29:43.014 --> 29:44.972
What are you doing?

29:47.436 --> 29:49.345
(she giggles)

29:57.152 --> 29:58.693
Seduce you?

30:07.285 --> 30:08.828
Wait, wait.

30:08.995 --> 30:10.952
What?

30:12.831 --> 30:15.121
What? What?

30:17.294 --> 30:19.251
Lets  just see what happens.

30:21.338 --> 30:22.751
<i>Jake...</i>

30:29.595 --> 30:31.553
I'm in love with you.

30:38.812 --> 30:40.686
<i>- I love you.
- Jake...</i>

30:40.855 --> 30:42.266
I love you.

30:53.241 --> 30:55.197
(she moans) No.

31:41.114 --> 31:42.776
(he grunts)

31:43.992 --> 31:45.948
(moaning and panting)

32:11.723 --> 32:13.005
(baby grizzles)

33:14.360 --> 33:16.316
I'm late. Bye.

33:30.582 --> 33:32.622
(trickling)

33:39.381 --> 33:41.337
(water running)

34:22.376 --> 34:24.331
(dog barking)

34:25.212 --> 34:27.085
(Man)
Hey, Tanya, who's this?

34:27.255 --> 34:28.500
- Who's this? Look.
- (dog barks)

34:28.672 --> 34:30.547
- Dad!
- (father chuckles)

34:30.716 --> 34:32.672
Jake. How are you?

34:34.761 --> 34:37.299
- This is El.
- Oh, Elena, welcome!

34:37.472 --> 34:39.678
- Bienvenida.
- Thank you. Thank you.

34:39.849 --> 34:42.054
Come in, come in.

34:42.226 --> 34:44.893
Nice to see a different part of
Glasgow, you know?

34:45.061 --> 34:47.137
- And er...how's the PhD going?
- Yeah.

34:47.313 --> 34:49.270
El's whipping me into action.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.148
Thank you, Elena.

34:51.317 --> 34:53.108
Well, it's very lovely to have you here.

34:53.944 --> 34:57.027
- I've heard a lot about you.
- I've heard a lot about you, too.

34:57.197 --> 34:58.775
- All good, I hope?
- Mm.

34:59.699 --> 35:02.533
- All good.
- Habla usted espanol?

35:02.701 --> 35:04.576
That's very good. Very good accent.

35:04.745 --> 35:06.785
- "Do you speck Spanish?"
- Better than Jake.

35:06.955 --> 35:08.580
No, I'm brilliant.

35:08.748 --> 35:10.622
<i>Uno, dos...</i>

35:10.791 --> 35:12.203
<i>- You know...
- Tres.</i>

35:12.376 --> 35:14.037
Between us. Uno, dos, tres...

35:14.211 --> 35:16.536
Yeah, we can get to ten between us.
That's about it, really.

35:16.713 --> 35:18.421
It's one of our party tricks.

35:18.590 --> 35:20.465
- That's Jake's mum.
- Mm.

35:20.634 --> 35:22.258
That's right.

35:22.426 --> 35:24.419
- And little Jake.
- Look at that face.

35:24.595 --> 35:26.469
- Yeah.
- So sweet!

35:26.638 --> 35:29.011
- Yeah, he's about one there.
- One year old?

35:29.182 --> 35:30.973
Where is this place?

35:31.142 --> 35:34.144
Er...well, we moved there
when Jake was ten.

35:35.562 --> 35:39.690
Jake's granddad used to own some land
and he built that shed many years ago.

35:39.858 --> 35:42.527
- Oh.
- I extended it and did some stuff on it.

35:42.694 --> 35:45.101
- There, that's me up there.
- This one here?

35:45.279 --> 35:46.738
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

35:46.906 --> 35:49.360
Yes, smartened it up a bit
and we moved in.

35:49.532 --> 35:52.201
- I like that one.
- Yeah. It was a beautiful place.

35:52.368 --> 35:56.365
- It looks like, I don't know, magical.
- Yeah.

35:56.538 --> 35:57.997
Well, it was.

35:58.164 --> 35:59.992
Why did you even leave?

36:00.167 --> 36:04.662
Well, Jake was growing up and it used
to get very cold in the winter.

36:04.837 --> 36:07.756
<i>And Jules, my wife, was getting very ill
at that point, so...</i>

36:08.799 --> 36:11.918
It  just wasn't practical, really,
so we had to give it up.

36:13.303 --> 36:16.138
It's a bit dull at the moment. In a couple
of months, it'll all be in flower.

36:16.305 --> 36:18.215
- No, it's great.
- Beautiful.

36:18.890 --> 36:21.725
- Will it still take my weight?
- Yeah, should do. Go on, give it a go.

36:21.893 --> 36:23.850
"Should do." (chuckles)

36:24.979 --> 36:26.687
Filling me with confidence.

36:26.856 --> 36:29.525
<i>(Elena)
We could stay longer now we're here.</i>

36:29.692 --> 36:31.186
- If you want.
- I'd love to.

36:31.359 --> 36:33.151
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:38.115 --> 36:39.990
That bedroom is so funny.

36:40.158 --> 36:42.116
Like, how you were growing up here...

36:42.869 --> 36:44.779
So, you were kissing girls like this?

36:44.954 --> 36:46.413
Give me your hands.

36:46.581 --> 36:48.490
I'm gonna read your palms.

36:50.501 --> 36:52.208
Let me read your palm.

36:53.879 --> 36:56.915
- What's this?
- It says you've got a really bright future.

37:01.176 --> 37:04.047
- (she laughs)
- (Jake) Get in the covers!

37:10.017 --> 37:11.513
(she exhales)

37:12.394 --> 37:13.889
- I have to pee.
- No! No, no, no.

37:14.062 --> 37:15.177
What?

37:15.356 --> 37:20.645
I think... I think you should stay still
and  just let the sperm swim.

37:21.569 --> 37:24.357
Like, I really felt like this was the one,
you know?

37:24.530 --> 37:27.281
<i>It's like when I came, it was like...
It was like...</i>

37:27.448 --> 37:29.406
(imitates rocket taking off)

37:33.704 --> 37:35.660
(imitates explosion)

37:36.456 --> 37:38.200
Like a rocket?

37:45.046 --> 37:46.921
(overlapping chatter)

37:47.090 --> 37:49.629
- I really want a beer.
- Take it easy, it's very, very strong.

37:49.801 --> 37:52.042
-  just a sip.
- I'll drink your glass of vino for you.

37:52.219 --> 37:54.509
Nine months of non-alcoholic cocktails.

37:54.680 --> 37:57.170
- Thank you, El.
- You need to tell me what to do.

37:58.225 --> 38:01.344
- I'll give you all of my books.
- Here's to the little babe.

38:01.519 --> 38:03.927
OK, for this new Carly.

38:04.105 --> 38:05.931
I’m  just so tired.

38:06.106 --> 38:08.265
I  just, like, fantasize
about sleeping under my desk.

38:08.442 --> 38:10.933
And all I wanna eat is,
like, cheese and chips.

38:11.111 --> 38:12.439
And bread. Anything beige.

38:12.612 --> 38:15.317
I felt awful all the way through
my pregnancies.

38:15.490 --> 38:16.865
- For how long?
- The whole way.

38:17.032 --> 38:18.574
- It's so exciting!
- Thank you.

38:18.742 --> 38:20.734
And now there's only one of us left to go.

38:20.911 --> 38:22.785
Oh, no, come on.

38:22.953 --> 38:24.531
Jake's, what, like, 14?

38:24.705 --> 38:26.662
- Shut up!
- You need to give him a chance!

38:26.832 --> 38:28.742
You need to be careful, though, you know?

38:28.917 --> 38:32.251
- I was off the pill for two months.
- It's like me and my sister, seriously.

38:32.421 --> 38:34.828
Cross a man on the stairs,
we're having twins.

38:35.005 --> 38:36.916
- No, I'm super fertile.
- (laughs)

38:37.550 --> 38:38.795
It's a nightmare!

38:38.967 --> 38:40.462
Oh, it's going to be so much fun!

38:40.636 --> 38:43.470
(Rose) All of us with our babies.
We should have picnics in the park.

38:43.638 --> 38:45.382
(Carly)
Aww! I love that.

38:45.557 --> 38:48.130
(Siobhan) You're gonna have
a beautiful little neat bump.

38:48.308 --> 38:51.061
(Carly) I think I'm going to
swell up like a balloon.

38:51.228 --> 38:54.431
(Siobhan) Little butterfly,
little butterfly feelings.

39:28.259 --> 39:30.216
(keyboard clocking)

39:46.941 --> 39:48.400
<i>Hi.</i>

39:51.528 --> 39:53.688
El, I'm really tired. Sorry.

39:54.698 --> 39:56.690
I've had a really long day.

40:08.960 --> 40:10.372
I'm ovulating,

40:11.296 --> 40:13.668
so we have to do it now
because it's the time.

40:15.299 --> 40:18.335
- Can we do it in the morning?
- In the morning might be too late.

40:18.509 --> 40:20.135
Oh, it's too late that quickly?

40:20.303 --> 40:23.423
Because it's 38 hours
and I don't know if I'm at the beginning

40:23.598 --> 40:26.467
or at the end of the hours,
so I don't know how you work that out.

40:27.476 --> 40:29.136
So, it's, like, now.

40:35.482 --> 40:36.859
It's not weird?

40:37.026 --> 40:38.982
No. It's fine.

40:42.447 --> 40:44.024
Hang on.

40:46.408 --> 40:47.820
(grunting)

40:56.041 --> 40:57.916
- No, no,  just leave it.
- OK.

40:58.085 --> 40:59.543
Let's go.

41:09.761 --> 41:11.671
Wait. I'm gonna give you a blow job.

41:11.846 --> 41:13.838
No, no, it's fine. It's good.

41:14.014 --> 41:15.759
- It's good.
- You sure?

41:15.933 --> 41:17.807
<i>Yeah, ssh.</i>

41:17.976 --> 41:19.934
Ssh.  just don't talk.

41:21.188 --> 41:22.896
(Punting)

41:29.278 --> 41:30.985
(grunting)

41:46.250 --> 41:47.827
- What's wrong?
- You  just...

41:48.002 --> 41:49.994
- You didn't look like you were into it.
- What?

41:50.171 --> 41:52.127
<i>Er...l was into it.</i>

41:53.757 --> 41:55.464
(whispers) I was into it.

41:55.633 --> 41:57.840
No, I need a wee. Hang on.

42:06.810 --> 42:08.351
(door closes)

42:09.562 --> 42:11.223
(Pounding)

42:27.994 --> 42:30.117
l  just...
I don't like switching it on like that.

42:30.287 --> 42:32.826
- OK, I'm sorry.
- It feels mechanical and weird.

42:32.998 --> 42:35.489
<i>- I said it was weird.
- I don't wanna do it like that again.</i>

42:35.668 --> 42:36.865
OK. It doesn't matter.

42:37.043 --> 42:39.035
Well, it does matter
if we're missing the time now.

42:39.211 --> 42:40.956
We can do it tomorrow morning.

42:46.051 --> 42:50.712
So, I'm wondering, maybe
there's something wrong with me?

42:54.975 --> 42:57.384
What could be wrong with you?
You're perfect.

42:57.561 --> 42:59.517
- No, I'm serious.
- I'm serious.

43:00.438 --> 43:02.395
(she sighs)

43:03.774 --> 43:06.016
l  just... I don't think we should worry.

43:09.821 --> 43:12.194
In, like, a few months' time,
if I'm not pregnant,

43:12.365 --> 43:14.322
we should have some tests.

43:17.577 --> 43:18.527
<i>OK.</i>

43:18.704 --> 43:22.156
(whispers) You're saying OK
because you don't think we need them.

43:22.332 --> 43:25.534
Well, if we don't need them,
that's a good thing, isn't it?

43:27.461 --> 43:28.919
<i>Yeah.</i>

43:43.558 --> 43:45.764
I ELEANORJANES AND AMANDA COOK:
"El Vito"

44:08.037 --> 44:11.702
(Doctor) All right, Elena Aldana
and Jacoby Kendrick Wilson.

44:11.873 --> 44:15.954
You've both been through various tests and
you're here today to get the results?

44:16.127 --> 44:17.504
Can I have both your dates of birth?

44:17.671 --> 44:20.339
Mine is 10th November, erm...1980.

44:21.256 --> 44:22.882
<i>Jake's, uh...</i>

44:23.050 --> 44:24.924
August 20...?

44:25.093 --> 44:27.584
Uh...August 27th,1989.

44:27.762 --> 44:29.422
Thank you.

44:29.596 --> 44:31.673
Tell me how long
you've been trying to conceive.

44:31.849 --> 44:33.889
- About six months.
- Five-and-c-half.

44:34.059 --> 44:35.934
- Elena, ever been pregnant before?
- Uh-uh.

44:36.102 --> 44:38.640
Including any miscarriages, terminations?

44:40.148 --> 44:42.104
I had an abortion. But I was, like, 18.

44:42.274 --> 44:46.817
Less than four weeks' pregnant, I think,
like, I hardly remember it.

44:46.986 --> 44:48.363
<i>But...</i>

44:48.530 --> 44:51.198
Does it affect somehow?

44:51.365 --> 44:53.856
- Not unless there was any complications.
- No.

44:54.034 --> 44:55.991
- And you're not married?
- No.

44:56.745 --> 45:00.162
So, what I suggest is that as you've been
trying to conceive for six months,

45:00.332 --> 45:04.910
and, Elena, you're over 35, you should get
yourselves down on the IVF waiting list.

45:05.085 --> 45:09.213
That way if you still need to, you can
begin the IVF treatment in six months.

45:09.381 --> 45:12.132
That would be the start of January
next year.

45:14.885 --> 45:17.673
Wait, sorry, but there's nothing wrong?

45:18.763 --> 45:20.755
<i>So why should we do, like...</i>

45:20.931 --> 45:23.423
<i>We weren't thinking of doing IVF,
so it's...</i>

45:23.601 --> 45:26.603
If you do put your names down on the list
and then change your mind,

45:26.770 --> 45:28.514
you can always opt out.

45:28.688 --> 45:30.599
But it's up to you.

45:35.861 --> 45:37.522
What do you think?

45:39.281 --> 45:41.440
Well, I don't know, it's your decision.

45:42.408 --> 45:45.196
Well, it's both our decisions, actually.

45:53.751 --> 45:58.745
<i>OK, this... Maybe this
isn't how I imagined us having a baby.</i>

45:59.089 --> 46:00.964
Look, it doesn't seem...

46:01.133 --> 46:02.544
What?

46:04.302 --> 46:07.385
Jake, how do you think I feel?

46:08.639 --> 46:09.885
I've... I've got no idea!

46:10.057 --> 46:12.726
Well, I'm the one who
has to go through the thing.

46:12.893 --> 46:16.676
- Do you think this is my dream situation?
- It just doesn't seem very romantic.

46:17.897 --> 46:20.305
Do you know what you sound like?
Really naive.

46:20.482 --> 46:22.973
Like, you have this notion of this per...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:23.151 --> 46:25.392
You have this notion of this perfect life,
or something.

46:25.570 --> 46:27.444
Well, life is not like that.

46:27.613 --> 46:29.570
So sorry to disappoint you.

46:32.325 --> 46:35.908
To be honest, I don't know what
we're doing. Like, you are so young.

46:36.079 --> 46:37.704
We don't know each other.

46:37.871 --> 46:39.864
Don't laugh. We don't know each other.

46:40.040 --> 46:44.121
I mean, we should have never even
started this. It's fucking ridiculous!

46:56.680 --> 46:58.636
(water running)

47:06.688 --> 47:08.016
Stop.

47:08.857 --> 47:10.434
Stop.

47:11.108 --> 47:12.686
Sit down.

47:18.031 --> 47:19.146
(she sniffs)

47:22.159 --> 47:23.784
El, please don't cry.

47:23.952 --> 47:25.827
(whispers) I'm not crying.

47:25.996 --> 47:27.952
I'm not crying. I'm sorry.

47:29.499 --> 47:31.160
(she sniffs)

47:31.917 --> 47:33.080
I'm fine.

47:33.252 --> 47:38.673
Ifs  just I don't wont anyone else
involved in us having a baby.

47:38.840 --> 47:42.968
- No one else is gonna be involved.
- I want it to be  just us.

47:43.386 --> 47:45.295
It's gonna be  just us.

47:46.639 --> 47:49.639
It's gonna be fine. It's...gonna happen.

47:52.352 --> 47:56.218
But we  just have August, September,
October, November, December,

47:56.397 --> 47:59.231
so five, maybe six tries.

47:59.983 --> 48:01.311
- That's ages.
- (sniffs)

48:01.484 --> 48:03.358
We've got loads of time.

48:03.527 --> 48:04.774
Yeah?

48:06.196 --> 48:10.063
That's how these things work. They  just
happen when you least expect them to.

48:10.241 --> 48:12.068
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

48:35.221 --> 48:36.679
- I love it.
- You like it?

<i>Yeah.</i>

48:39.850 --> 48:41.806
<i>(she speaks Catalan)</i>

48:44.312 --> 48:46.269
Jake, she says hi.

48:47.315 --> 48:49.189
- Hole.
- (chuckles)

48:50.317 --> 48:51.978
Hey, Jake, look.

48:54.487 --> 48:56.065
For Carly's baby.

48:56.989 --> 48:58.863
- Cute, huh?
- Yeah, really cute.

48:59.033 --> 49:00.990
(she imitates duck sounds)

49:04.996 --> 49:06.657
- It doesn't fit.
- No, it fits.

49:06.831 --> 49:08.575
Wait, wait, wait. Like that.

49:08.749 --> 49:10.291
<i>It fits.</i>

49:11.459 --> 49:13.370
-  just... Right.
- (Andrew) Pudding.

49:13.545 --> 49:15.087
- Come on, Jake!
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

49:15.254 --> 49:17.331
<i>Plates. OK.</i>

49:17.507 --> 49:20.544
(Joke) Hove you had enough, you two?

49:20.718 --> 49:21.750
Thank you.

49:23.053 --> 49:25.010
- El?
- (Andrew) Nice and warm.

49:25.764 --> 49:27.839
Andrew, do you want me
to clean this up a little bit?

49:28.015 --> 49:29.807
- Don't worry about that.
- What about this?

49:29.976 --> 49:31.387
- Hey, Andrew.
- Hm?

49:31.560 --> 49:33.435
This is a very nice party.

49:33.604 --> 49:35.560
Oh, thank you.

49:42.111 --> 49:44.068
(she urinates)

50:01.294 --> 50:03.038
(inhales sharply)

50:57.966 --> 51:00.256
We don't have to do it
if you don't wont to.

51:03.638 --> 51:05.595
But we're in this together.

51:06.932 --> 51:09.008
I'll be with you all the way through it.

51:11.395 --> 51:12.890
(she sighs)

51:18.150 --> 51:20.310
I want to if you want to.

51:47.925 --> 51:50.595
Happy New Year, my darling.
Happy anniversary.

51:50.761 --> 51:52.718
(music playing)

52:26.041 --> 52:29.457
(Nurse) Again, you come to
the clinic, and you go off to theatre.

52:29.627 --> 52:31.003
You're sedated, OK?

52:31.170 --> 52:32.962
So you need to have someone come with you.

52:33.130 --> 52:36.583
We go into your ovaries,
and we empty each follicle in turn

52:36.759 --> 52:39.000
as we see it
on the ultrasound monitor.

52:39.177 --> 52:42.629
Then the embryologists
work to make your embryos, hopefully.

52:42.805 --> 52:46.138
And they'll keep in touch with you and
then usually about five days later,

52:46.308 --> 52:48.680
you come back for your embryo transfer.

52:48.851 --> 52:50.643
What I'm gonna go and do
is get your drugs,

52:50.812 --> 52:54.478
and I'll show you how you're gonna
do these injections, OK, at home.

52:54.649 --> 52:57.649
So I'll pop out and get them
and I'll come back in  just a few minutes.

52:57.817 --> 52:59.977
- (Jake) Great, thank you. Thanks so much.
- OK.

53:01.654 --> 53:03.280
(door opens)

53:05.532 --> 53:07.075
- (door closes)
- It's good.

53:07.243 --> 53:09.117
I didn't get anything.

53:09.286 --> 53:12.821
It's fine. It's gonna sound alien,
but it'll be fine.

53:13.706 --> 53:15.663
We  just do everything she says.

53:16.459 --> 53:19.911
Make sure that you're relaxed, calm,
eating right.

53:23.757 --> 53:25.713

53:38.269 --> 53:39.680

53:39.853 --> 53:41.894
You've changed since I first met you.

53:43.481 --> 53:45.854
Whisky on the rocks while you shoot up,
huh?

53:47.776 --> 53:50.695
I've got dinner for you, but I suppose
you don't want dinner, do you?

53:50.863 --> 53:52.190
(chuckles) No.

53:54.366 --> 53:56.156
I want to do this first.

53:56.992 --> 54:00.610
That's the problem with you junkies,
drugs always come first.

54:01.830 --> 54:03.289
Shut up.

54:04.374 --> 54:06.034
Shut up, please.

54:10.295 --> 54:12.087
I think if you  just jab it in quickly...

54:12.256 --> 54:14.165
Stop it.

54:16.718 --> 54:20.004
It's super easy for you to soy.
I mean, you don't have to do it.

54:20.179 --> 54:22.053
Well, I was a marine for 15 years,

54:22.222 --> 54:25.093
so it's actually really easy
for me to deal with pain.

54:25.975 --> 54:29.309
Yeah, I was trained to inject
into any orifice in my body -

54:29.478 --> 54:31.684
- my eyeball, my arsehole...

54:35.525 --> 54:37.400

What are you doing?

54:37.569 --> 54:39.443
What are you doing?

54:39.612 --> 54:41.439
What? No, Jake.

54:41.614 --> 54:42.895
- Don't do it.
- Hm?

54:43.073 --> 54:46.157
Jake, no, wait, wait.
You don't have to do it. Don't do it.

54:46.326 --> 54:48.698
Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.

54:48.870 --> 54:50.827
No, ple... (gasps)

54:52.414 --> 54:54.241
Oh, my God!
(laughs)

54:56.376 --> 54:57.954
Oh, my God!

54:58.128 --> 55:00.168
- It hurts.
- (muffled) That is love.

55:01.714 --> 55:04.335
- That is pure solidarity, that is.
- (she laughs)

55:14.392 --> 55:17.060
You look how I feel,
desperate to get up the road.

55:17.227 --> 55:18.935
Yeah, me, too. I'm very tired.

55:19.104 --> 55:21.856
Hey, you know, I was thinking to go
shopping one night after work.

55:22.023 --> 55:23.482
- You fancy it?
- Yeah, sure.

55:23.650 --> 55:25.393
- Great. You want a cup of tea?
- Oh, no, no.

55:25.567 --> 55:27.026
- You sure?
- Yeah, sure, thank you.

55:27.194 --> 55:28.606
- OK.
- Bye.

55:28.779 --> 55:30.155
(chuckles)

55:36.035 --> 55:41.077
I'm riding down the Castlereagh
and I'm a station hand

55:41.623 --> 55:46.166
I'm handy with the ropin' pole,
I'm handy with a brand

55:47.627 --> 55:53.215
And I can ride a rowdy colt
or swing the axe all day

55:54.509 --> 55:59.170
But there's no demand for a station hand
along the Castlereagh

55:59.346 --> 56:01.588
So, shift, boys, shift

56:02.307 --> 56:05.094
- I For there isn't the slightest doubt...
- What are you cooking?

56:06.185 --> 56:08.142
- It's hot.
- Mm-hm.

56:11.190 --> 56:15.768
So I saddled up my pack horse
and I whistled to my dog

56:16.902 --> 56:21.362
I made for up the country
at the old jig-jog

56:21.531 --> 56:24.651
So, shift, boys, shift

56:24.951 --> 56:27.027

Hey, I'm gonna be a little bit late, like,
3O minutes, I think.

56:48.930 --> 56:53.094
I went to lllawcrra
where my brother has a farm

56:54.351 --> 56:58.846
He has to ask his landlord's leave
before he lifts an arm

57:00.647 --> 57:06.105
The landlord owns the countryside,
man, woman, dog and cat

57:07.570 --> 57:11.983
And they haven't the cheek to dare
to speck without they touch their hat

57:18.205 --> 57:22.201

You were with her dancing.

57:44.644 --> 57:46.767
- Definitely. I got you an orange juice.
- Thanks.

57:46.937 --> 57:48.929
Definitely. Yeah, well, that's true.

57:49.106 --> 57:51.513
- When?
- I don't know. Two, three months ago?

57:51.691 --> 57:54.230
Oh, yeah. (laughs)
But that's cos...

57:54.402 --> 57:56.478
I'm gonna pop out and get some fresh air.

- When's the next scan?
- Tomorrow.

nothing to worry about?</i>

58:11.583 --> 58:12.994

58:20.215 --> 58:22.375
- I'm sorry.
- You don't need to be sorry.

58:22.551 --> 58:23.832
- Are you cold?
- Yeah.

58:24.010 --> 58:25.006
Right.

58:29.097 --> 58:30.759
Come on. Let's go.

58:30.933 --> 58:33.423
<i>(Nurse)
OK, so your scan looks great to me.</i>

58:33.601 --> 58:36.222
Your follicles look like they've grown
and responded,

58:36.395 --> 58:39.397
so I would say you're ready to
have your eggs collected.

58:39.565 --> 58:40.941
OK, so well done.

58:41.108 --> 58:43.398
- So, it's good?
- It's great news. Great news.

58:43.569 --> 58:45.644
- That's what you want.
- I told you not to worry.

58:45.820 --> 58:48.229
<i>(Nurse) So, you know,
that's 24 hours off of work.</i>

58:48.406 --> 58:50.979
<i>You'll be sedated that day, so you need
someone with you to drive.</i>

58:51.157 --> 58:55.368
<i>That's where you come {n and you'll be
expected to give your sample that day.</i>

59:01.542 --> 59:03.286

59:40.366 --> 59:42.441
- Yeah, how are you?
- Good, thank you.

59:43.244 --> 59:45.699
<i>So, you have two grade-A blastocysts,
Elena.</i>

59:45.871 --> 59:47.781
<i>It's a very good result.</i>

59:48.623 --> 59:50.200
OK. But why only two?

59:50.374 --> 59:51.751
<i>I thought we had, like...</i>

59:51.918 --> 59:54.159
<i>There's always a fall-off,
that's completely normal.</i>

59:54.336 --> 59:57.954
<i>Poorer ones stop developing, so only the
best ones make ft to day-five blastocysts.</i>

59:58.131 --> 59:59.756
<i>It's perfectly normal.</i>

01:00:01.134 --> 01:00:02.925

tomorrow morning.</i>

This is  just a mock catheter, OK?

01:00:34.412 --> 01:00:36.701
So, there's nothing in it.
Your embryos are not in it.

01:00:36.872 --> 01:00:39.660

- Er...it shouldn't hurt.

01:00:43.711 --> 01:00:45.668
Relax your muscles there.

01:00:50.925 --> 01:00:52.883
That's it. All right.

01:00:54.095 --> 01:00:57.262
Well, I’ve  just given a signal
to the embryologist,

01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:01.342
and she'll load up your embryo
into a real catheter, OK?

01:01:06.689 --> 01:01:08.682
Have a look at the screen again.

01:01:10.359 --> 01:01:12.517

let everything settle down,
all right?

01:01:14.946 --> 01:01:17.152

(Joke) Hg!

01:04:10.844 --> 01:04:12.719
So, it was a long interview, basically.

01:04:12.888 --> 01:04:14.845
It lasted, like, two hours.

01:04:15.973 --> 01:04:18.892
And there were two of them and they did,
like, good cop, bad cop.

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.056
<i>OK.</i>

01:04:21.354 --> 01:04:24.390
And it finished. I went for a walk
for about 2O minutes,

01:04:25.524 --> 01:04:27.896
came back and everyone
was grabbing my hand.

01:04:28.067 --> 01:04:32.776
Lots of handshaking,
and then they told me that I passed.

01:04:33.447 --> 01:04:34.942
- That's amazing!
- Yeah.

01:04:35.115 --> 01:04:36.573
Then a few of us went for a drink

01:04:36.741 --> 01:04:38.533
and my supervisor bought me
a bottle of champagne.

01:04:38.702 --> 01:04:40.576
- That's so sweet, right?
- Yeah.

01:04:40.744 --> 01:04:43.200
It  just feels like it's come at the right
time, you know?

01:04:43.372 --> 01:04:46.207
I’ve  just got a good feeling about...
things. About everything.

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:48.331
Yeah. I'm so proud of you.

01:04:49.043 --> 01:04:50.788
And how about you?
How was your day?

01:04:50.962 --> 01:04:53.452
Yeah, I actually feel
a little bit different.

01:04:54.297 --> 01:04:56.255
W-What do you mean?

01:04:57.092 --> 01:04:59.927
I don't want to get too excited,
but I feel pregnant.

01:05:00.095 --> 01:05:05.088
Because my boobs hurt, they are bigger
and I've been feeling sick, dizzy...

01:05:06.141 --> 01:05:08.098
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:05:08.852 --> 01:05:11.307
Yeah. But we cannot get excited yet.

01:05:12.772 --> 01:05:13.934
<i>No.</i>

01:05:14.815 --> 01:05:15.931
<i>OK.</i>

01:05:17.693 --> 01:05:21.228
This is not a proposal,
ifs  just a present.

01:05:23.447 --> 01:05:25.405
And it was my mum's.

01:05:28.702 --> 01:05:30.363
(whispers) It's beautiful.

01:05:30.537 --> 01:05:31.818
I love it.

01:05:34.165 --> 01:05:36.537
- You really like it?
- I really, really like it.

01:05:36.708 --> 01:05:38.167
I love it.

01:05:38.335 --> 01:05:39.960
Thank you.

01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:46.876

- Yes!
- You like it?

We both love it!

- Yeah, good.
- You're looking gorgeous.

01:09:05.551 --> 01:09:07.260
I look like a fucking whale.

01:09:07.428 --> 01:09:08.923

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.182
OK. Hey!

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:14.845
Do you wanna say hello?

01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:18.102
I just want to say she's absolutely
gorgeous, isn't she?

01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:20.015
Aw, look at her.

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:22.763
- Where's your daddy gone?
- Look dt the big eyes as well.

01:09:22.941 --> 01:09:25.609
- I know.
- She's beautiful. Look at the smiles.

01:09:26.611 --> 01:09:28.520
Do you want to go outside?

01:09:29.197 --> 01:09:30.941
- Do you wanna go or not?
- Yeah.

- I’ve joined a gym.
- Really?

and avoid having a heart attack

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:42.580
- Before your... your daughter?
- Yes!

01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:44.743

01:09:45.961 --> 01:09:48.001
Wow. Congratulations.

01:09:48.171 --> 01:09:49.666

- Yeah.

Annelise over there.

01:09:57.095 --> 01:09:59.052
She's the beast, obviously.

01:10:00.181 --> 01:10:01.593
- Yeah.
- (chuckles)

01:10:17.154 --> 01:10:18.815
We cannot leave, Jake.

01:10:18.989 --> 01:10:20.650
- It's rude.
- OK, so we'll stay.

01:10:20.824 --> 01:10:22.863
Then we have to go and talk to people,
so come on.

01:10:23.034 --> 01:10:24.315
You go and talk to people.

01:10:24.494 --> 01:10:26.617
Elena, don't start.
I don't need another argument.

01:10:26.787 --> 01:10:28.246
- Neither do I.
- Then just leave it.

01:10:28.414 --> 01:10:29.611

-  just leave it.

01:10:29.789 --> 01:10:31.331
- What?
- Don't shout.

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:34.453
- Do you wont everyone to hear?
- No, I don't wont that.

01:10:35.127 --> 01:10:36.753
My parents never, ever shouted.

01:10:36.921 --> 01:10:40.005
Well, we're not your fucking
perfect parents, right?

01:10:42.759 --> 01:10:44.337

01:11:46.104 --> 01:11:47.515
It's OK.

01:11:49.065 --> 01:11:51.022
We need to stop this.

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:53.688
Both of us.

01:11:55.987 --> 01:11:57.613
(whispers) I know.

01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:02.575
We need to  just try and forget
about the baby thing...

01:12:04.036 --> 01:12:05.827
...and just get on with our life.

01:12:08.623 --> 01:12:11.197

I'll make some coffee.

01:16:12.037 --> 01:16:15.619
The thing is, if we do it again with the
National Health, we have to wait a year.

01:16:16.832 --> 01:16:19.288
But if we do it privately,
we don't have to wait.

Like, we go right away.

01:16:21.169 --> 01:16:24.787

so we make sure this time works.

01:16:26.383 --> 01:16:28.422
Where are you gonna get the money?

01:16:28.592 --> 01:16:30.550
I'm gonna rob a bank.

01:16:31.512 --> 01:16:33.468
Seriously, though, it's expensive.

01:16:33.638 --> 01:16:35.299
Jake wants to ask his dad.

01:16:35.474 --> 01:16:38.047
- Really?
- I said no, obviously.

01:16:38.225 --> 01:16:40.183
But I think we need to get a loan.

01:16:42.605 --> 01:16:45.060
Well, you just need to make sure
you can pay it back.

01:16:45.231 --> 01:16:46.893
Yeah, I know.

01:16:47.067 --> 01:16:48.941
Shit, my boobs are gonna pop.

01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:51.565
(chuckles) I need to feed you.

01:16:51.737 --> 01:16:53.729
(in sing-song voice) I need to feed you.

01:16:53.905 --> 01:16:55.186
Are you hungry?

01:16:55.366 --> 01:16:57.986
(gasps) Are you hungry? Yeah, you are.

01:16:58.159 --> 01:17:02.572
Sometimes I think it is
because I'm a bad person.

01:17:05.415 --> 01:17:07.407
What do you mean?

01:17:10.378 --> 01:17:12.334
<i>That maybe I cannot have kids...</i>

01:17:14.006 --> 01:17:15.583
<i>...because I'm cold.</i>

01:17:15.757 --> 01:17:17.715

01:17:19.177 --> 01:17:21.134
El, you're not cold.

01:17:22.013 --> 01:17:23.887
You're anything but cold.

01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:25.634
(baby grizzles)

01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:27.764
Ssh, ssh. (whispers) I know. I know.

01:17:28.643 --> 01:17:29.723
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:17:32.438 --> 01:17:34.395
Anyway, it will work this time.

01:17:38.652 --> 01:17:40.608
(baby grizzles)

01:17:41.612 --> 01:17:43.190
Maybe...

01:17:44.573 --> 01:17:46.531
Maybe you shouldn't do it again.

01:17:49.286 --> 01:17:51.243
Maybe you should just try and...

01:17:52.955 --> 01:17:54.912
I don't know, just see what happens.

01:17:58.835 --> 01:18:04.126
But the thing is that I am missing a baby
that will never exist.

01:18:05.174 --> 01:18:06.716
You understand?

01:18:07.551 --> 01:18:11.050
Like, I have all these dreams of my baby,
of my child,

01:18:11.221 --> 01:18:13.048
<i>of how it will be like...</i>

01:18:13.223 --> 01:18:16.341
like my child with Jake.

01:18:17.768 --> 01:18:19.642
Or how it will be like to bring it up,

01:18:19.811 --> 01:18:22.480
or to look after him,

01:18:22.647 --> 01:18:26.146
or how would I be, you know?

01:18:26.317 --> 01:18:28.725
Like, all the stuff
I will be doing with him.

01:18:29.612 --> 01:18:31.901
And all of this will never exist.

01:18:33.991 --> 01:18:35.615
<i>And that...</i>

01:18:35.783 --> 01:18:37.741
that makes me feel so sad.

01:18:40.454 --> 01:18:42.411
<i>Like I'm...</i>

01:18:44.165 --> 01:18:46.574
<i>...I'm grieving a baby I will...</i>

01:18:48.794 --> 01:18:50.289
...never know.

01:18:52.297 --> 01:18:54.171
I'm so sorry.

01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:56.582
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.

01:19:01.972 --> 01:19:04.297
There's worse things than not having kids.

01:19:35.709 --> 01:19:38.200
<i>(Doctor)
OK, right, let me explain something.</i>

01:19:38.378 --> 01:19:41.414
<i>Every year,
I help hundreds of women to conceive.</i>

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:46.921
But I can only work with good quality
eggs, otherwise my job's impossible.

01:19:47.094 --> 01:19:48.968
Do you understand?

01:19:49.137 --> 01:19:51.592
I wouldn't advise you to pursue IVF.

01:19:51.764 --> 01:19:55.015
You've got under a five per cent chance
of conceiving.

01:19:56.435 --> 01:19:58.309
And why do you say that?

01:19:58.478 --> 01:20:03.307
<i>The AMH test, it showed a...
a low ovarian reserve.</i>

01:20:03.483 --> 01:20:06.270
<i>Er...it's an indicator of quality
and er... quantity.</i>

01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:10.111
We read that the...
that that testis inaccurate.

01:20:12.032 --> 01:20:14.901
<i>In my professional opinion,
it's... it's accurate.</i>

01:20:16.077 --> 01:20:20.026
Elena's friends are all having babies,
and they're the same age as her.

01:20:29.797 --> 01:20:31.671
He was talking bullshit.

01:20:31.839 --> 01:20:35.422
just thinking about his statistics,
like school league tables.

01:20:35.593 --> 01:20:37.468
We'll go somewhere else.

01:20:37.637 --> 01:20:39.380
Where?

01:20:40.263 --> 01:20:42.221
That first clinic we looked at.

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.842
It was even more
expensive than his one.

01:20:46.019 --> 01:20:48.059
That probably means it's the best one.

01:20:49.354 --> 01:20:51.727
Or maybe they'll just tell us
the some thing?

01:20:51.898 --> 01:20:54.021
Or maybe that guy? just a cunt.

01:20:55.610 --> 01:20:57.566
(traffic drowns out Jake)

01:20:59.155 --> 01:21:01.111
We'll go somewhere else.

01:21:03.075 --> 01:21:04.403
Where will we get the money?

01:21:04.576 --> 01:21:06.900
I told you, my dad said
he'll give it to us.

01:21:11.499 --> 01:21:13.124
(water running)

01:21:13.291 --> 01:21:15.248
(water off)

01:21:23.967 --> 01:21:25.758
(Jake sniffs)

01:21:29.722 --> 01:21:31.299
(he sniffs)

01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:39.227
(he stifles sobs)

01:21:55.786 --> 01:21:57.493
(he sobs)

01:21:59.372 --> 01:22:01.116
(birdsong)

01:22:03.459 --> 01:22:05.415
<i>(Jake)
Hey, sorry I missed your call.</i>

01:22:05.585 --> 01:22:07.875
<i>Erm.../ hope you're fee/mg OK.</i>

01:22:08.838 --> 01:22:11.212
<i>I hope you're resting and eating properly.</i>

01:22:13.217 --> 01:22:15.091
<i>I'll try you again later.</i>

01:22:15.261 --> 01:22:19.257
<i>I'll be free at about 4pm your time,
so I'll try you then.</i>

01:22:20.223 --> 01:22:21.681
<i>Or you try me.</i>

01:22:22.433 --> 01:22:24.308
<i>I miss you. I can't wait to see you.</i>

01:22:24.477 --> 01:22:26.433
<i>OK. Bye.</i>

01:22:33.526 --> 01:22:35.068
(children playing)

01:22:35.235 --> 01:22:37.905
Ah, good morning.
Or should I soy, good afternoon?

01:22:38.071 --> 01:22:39.483
Yeah, I remember those days,

01:22:39.656 --> 01:22:41.531
lying in bed, reading the Sunday papers.

01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:43.241
Ignore him. Morning, love.

01:22:43.409 --> 01:22:45.117
- Get a coffee.
- I'm fine, thanks.

01:22:45.286 --> 01:22:47.030
So, when's Jake back from his boat?

01:22:47.204 --> 01:22:49.778
- Tomorrow night.
- Sorry, what's he fishing for again?

01:22:49.957 --> 01:22:52.411
He's not fishing, he's observing.
He's an observer.

01:22:52.583 --> 01:22:54.790
- He's monitoring by-catch.
- By-catch?

01:22:54.961 --> 01:22:56.835
That's... That's a fish, is it not?

01:22:57.004 --> 01:22:59.210
- (she chuckles)
- No, it is. It's a big fish.

01:22:59.381 --> 01:23:01.871
- A very dangerous fish.
- Yeah, a big fish with big teeth.

01:23:02.049 --> 01:23:03.924
- Big teeth, yeah.
- And no fins.

01:23:04.093 --> 01:23:06.003
Hi, Auntie El. How are you?

01:23:06.178 --> 01:23:09.132
So, I think we’re just gonna do it
in a registry office.

01:23:09.306 --> 01:23:11.465
- You know, just with close family.
- Yeah.

01:23:11.642 --> 01:23:13.302
<i>But erm...</i>

01:23:13.476 --> 01:23:16.928
I wondered if you would be
my maid of honour.

01:23:20.482 --> 01:23:22.356
Of course. (chuckles) Yeah.

01:23:22.525 --> 01:23:24.483
Thank you.

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:28.190
I mean, it's more for legal stuff
for Lilly and the house.

01:23:28.364 --> 01:23:30.570
- But it'll be fun.
- Yeah, it'll be fun.

01:23:31.324 --> 01:23:33.199
Do you think you and Jake might do it?

01:23:33.368 --> 01:23:35.325
I mean, you could have a proper one -

01:23:36.371 --> 01:23:38.245
<i>a dress, disco...</i>

01:23:38.414 --> 01:23:41.498
I don't know.
I don't know what's gonna happen with us.

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:44.291
What do you mean?

01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:46.003
Stop it!

01:23:46.171 --> 01:23:48.329
(chuckles nervously)
He adores you.

01:23:48.505 --> 01:23:50.048
He gazes at you.

01:23:50.216 --> 01:23:52.588
I'd pay Mark money
to look at me like that.

01:23:53.552 --> 01:23:56.042
We'll see how things work out.

01:23:56.846 --> 01:23:59.965
(in sing-song voice)
We'll see how things work out, yeah?

01:24:01.016 --> 01:24:03.472
We'll see how things work...

01:24:34.461 --> 01:24:36.419
(message alert)

01:25:22.877 --> 01:25:24.834
(urinates)

01:25:57.073 --> 01:25:59.030
<i>(Jake)
Are you sure?</i>

01:26:00.534 --> 01:26:02.491
<i>Did you eat properly?</i>

01:26:04.204 --> 01:26:05.663
Did you relax?

01:26:06.873 --> 01:26:08.829
What are you saying, Jake?

01:26:16.005 --> 01:26:18.379
I told you to wait
so we could test together.

01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:20.506
So, what's the difference?

01:26:26.222 --> 01:26:28.179
This is happening to me, too, El.

01:26:31.769 --> 01:26:33.394
(he exhales)

01:26:33.562 --> 01:26:36.432
We have to...
We need to get out of this fucking flat.

01:26:37.649 --> 01:26:39.274
<i>(he sighs)</i>

01:26:40.401 --> 01:26:42.026
We should get something to eat.

01:26:42.194 --> 01:26:43.736
- El, come on.
- I'm not hungry, Jake.

01:26:43.903 --> 01:26:45.446
- Get up, come on.
- I'm not hungry.

01:26:45.614 --> 01:26:47.938
Please. Put your shoes on.

01:26:48.115 --> 01:26:50.073
Come on, let's go.

01:26:55.372 --> 01:26:57.247
What do you want to do, then?

01:26:57.416 --> 01:26:59.788
You just want to sit there
and be miserable?

01:27:02.587 --> 01:27:06.039
(she sighs) I'm gonna be fine in a minute.
You can go without me.

01:27:12.553 --> 01:27:14.594
<i>Yeah, can I get a...
a single whisky as well?</i>

01:27:14.764 --> 01:27:16.969
- Is the house whisky all right?
- Yeah, that's cool.

01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:19.300
I TWO LONE SWORDSMEN:
"Hey Deborah Anne"

01:27:42.578 --> 01:27:45.829
(indistinct conversation)

01:27:46.665 --> 01:27:49.121
Could I nick a cigarette?
ls that all right?

01:27:55.297 --> 01:27:57.255
(siren blares in near distance)

01:29:03.939 --> 01:29:05.102
(whispers)
Sorry.

01:29:05.274 --> 01:29:07.313
Did I wake you up?

01:29:07.483 --> 01:29:12.062
I want you so, it scares me to death

01:29:12.237 --> 01:29:13.780
You've got a great record collection.

01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:16.023
I can't say any more

01:29:16.199 --> 01:29:18.240
Where did you get it?

01:29:18.410 --> 01:29:19.488
From your dad?

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:21.321
(whispers)
Wow.

01:29:21.495 --> 01:29:23.536
He must have been a cool guy.

01:29:24.581 --> 01:29:26.492
He wasn't?

01:29:26.667 --> 01:29:27.663
(tuts)

01:29:27.834 --> 01:29:31.085
Well, he has a very beautiful daughter.

01:29:36.091 --> 01:29:38.131
(whispers)
Come dance with me.

01:29:39.594 --> 01:29:41.634
(whispers)
I think we should dance.

01:29:43.096 --> 01:29:45.766
- (whispers) I think we should dance.
- (whispers) Jake, no.

01:29:45.933 --> 01:29:47.760
(whispers)
Come on.

01:29:47.935 --> 01:29:49.180
(whispers)
Trust me.

01:29:49.352 --> 01:29:53.100
I Be careful, darling, you might fall

01:30:04.949 --> 01:30:06.526
(whispers)
I love you.

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:08.692
(she inhales sharply)

01:30:14.082 --> 01:30:16.121
(she sobs)

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.041
N-No, Jake.

01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:20.950
(sighs)

01:30:21.129 --> 01:30:23.169
Turn the music down.

01:30:23.965 --> 01:30:25.506
Turn the music down.

01:30:26.384 --> 01:30:28.507
(music off)

01:30:33.514 --> 01:30:35.840
Why can't we just, for once, just...

01:30:36.017 --> 01:30:38.057
just not even think, just have...

01:30:38.226 --> 01:30:40.018
just have fun?  just fun.

01:30:40.187 --> 01:30:41.563
I want you to talk to your dad.

01:30:41.730 --> 01:30:44.980
I wont you to tell him that we're
gonna pay him back his money.

01:30:45.149 --> 01:30:47.190
He doesn't want it back, El.

01:30:47.985 --> 01:30:51.354
(whispers)
Jake, I want to pay him back his money.

01:30:52.864 --> 01:30:54.608
- Please. (sniffles)
- Please don't cry.

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:56.823
El, please don't cry.

01:30:57.410 --> 01:30:59.236
Please. We're gonna have a baby.

01:30:59.411 --> 01:31:02.032
We’re just gonna keep trying
and trying until it works.

01:31:02.205 --> 01:31:03.533
El?

01:31:04.333 --> 01:31:05.661
(sighs)

01:31:15.383 --> 01:31:17.424
I love you so much.

01:31:20.471 --> 01:31:22.547
I love you so much.

01:31:22.723 --> 01:31:24.798
(she sighs tearfully)

01:31:26.643 --> 01:31:28.683
Come here.

01:31:32.106 --> 01:31:34.514
- (sniffles)
- It's OK.

01:31:34.692 --> 01:31:36.683
Come. Come. Come here.

01:31:49.203 --> 01:31:50.698
(mouths)

01:32:03.173 --> 01:32:04.586
(whispers)
It's OK.

01:32:22.899 --> 01:32:24.938
(he breathes heavily)

01:32:27.986 --> 01:32:29.482
(grunting)

01:32:43.541 --> 01:32:45.664
- El, what's wrong?
- (sobs)

01:32:52.465 --> 01:32:54.339
What's wrong?

01:32:54.508 --> 01:32:56.466
(she breathes heavily)

01:33:00.514 --> 01:33:02.258
El, what's wrong?

01:33:08.521 --> 01:33:10.265
Oh.

01:33:14.901 --> 01:33:17.107
(breathes heavily)

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:24.731
I don't think we should be together
any more.

01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:27.614
We're not good for each other,
we're not right.

01:33:28.203 --> 01:33:29.829
All we do is fight.

01:33:30.539 --> 01:33:32.947
That's not true. It's not true.

01:33:33.124 --> 01:33:34.501
It's true.

01:33:37.294 --> 01:33:38.707
Where's your ring?

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.540
I took it off.

01:33:40.714 --> 01:33:42.173
Why? You never take it off.

01:33:42.341 --> 01:33:44.464
It's not a wedding ring.
We're not married.

01:33:44.634 --> 01:33:47.553
- Why would you say that?
- Because it's true.

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:49.297
And I cannot have kids.

01:33:49.471 --> 01:33:51.797
So, what's the point in us being together?

01:33:52.766 --> 01:33:54.807
We'll never be a family.

01:33:55.894 --> 01:33:57.934
We're already a family.

01:33:59.189 --> 01:34:03.435
<i>El? You have to be more positive. You
ca... You can’t just keep being negative.</i>

01:34:03.609 --> 01:34:05.519
What are we going to do for 2O years?

01:34:05.694 --> 01:34:08.268
All our friends having babies,
bringing them up.

01:34:08.446 --> 01:34:10.023
What are we gonna do with that?

01:34:10.197 --> 01:34:12.439
We have this crazy...

01:34:12.617 --> 01:34:14.028
gap in our future.

01:34:14.201 --> 01:34:16.526
What are we going to do with it, huh?
Tell me.

01:34:19.622 --> 01:34:21.781
What are we gonna do with it?
No! No.

01:34:24.459 --> 01:34:26.500
I'm not a normal woman. I can't...

01:34:27.337 --> 01:34:29.378
I can't give you what you want.

01:34:31.382 --> 01:34:33.042
Can I?

01:34:38.138 --> 01:34:39.253
- Admit it.
- OK.

01:34:39.431 --> 01:34:40.842
Uh-huh.

01:34:41.766 --> 01:34:43.225
<i>OK.</i>

01:34:44.059 --> 01:34:48.804
Elena, you can't... You can't...
And why is that? Go on, explain it to me.

01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:51.733
- Cos it's starting to piss me off, too.
- Because I'm inadequate.

01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:53.690
"Inadequate"?
ls that what you want to hear?

01:34:53.859 --> 01:34:55.141
- "You're inadequate."
- Yeah.

01:34:55.319 --> 01:34:57.063
OK, you're inadequate. Like your mum.

01:34:57.237 --> 01:34:59.064
You're cold and you're mean
and bitter.

01:34:59.239 --> 01:35:02.607
And you are going to resent me
if you don't have kids.

01:35:02.783 --> 01:35:05.322
- Look me in the eye...
- Fuck off. Not listening to this shit.

01:35:05.494 --> 01:35:07.903
- Fuck you.
- It's the fucking truth. Fuck you!

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:09.657
You have no trust, El.

01:35:09.831 --> 01:35:11.623
You want me to be perfect, right?

01:35:11.792 --> 01:35:13.037
You want me to be perfect.

01:35:13.209 --> 01:35:15.119
- I'm not fucking perfect!
- I haven't left you.

01:35:15.294 --> 01:35:17.868
I haven't fucking left you, have I?
(breathes heavily)

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:19.837
I haven't cheated on you,
I'm not your dad.

01:35:20.006 --> 01:35:21.963
I haven't had affairs! You're paranoid!

01:35:22.133 --> 01:35:24.921
So, you will never leave me
if I don't have kids?

01:35:25.094 --> 01:35:28.213
Never leave me...will you?

01:35:29.014 --> 01:35:32.133
- No, I'm not listening to this shit.
- (whispers) Fucking liar.

01:35:32.308 --> 01:35:35.760
Answer... Wait, wait, wait, answer me.
Wait, wait, answer me.

01:35:39.231 --> 01:35:40.808
(Punting)

01:35:40.982 --> 01:35:42.809
Answer me.

01:35:42.984 --> 01:35:43.981
(sniffs)

01:35:44.152 --> 01:35:46.193
Open the fucking door!

01:35:46.613 --> 01:35:48.985
- You're fucking this up.
- Answer me.

01:35:55.245 --> 01:35:57.285
Answer my question.

01:35:57.997 --> 01:36:00.073
You're insane. You need fucking help.

01:36:00.916 --> 01:36:02.873
Answer me.

01:36:05.336 --> 01:36:06.998
<i>OK.</i>

01:36:07.172 --> 01:36:08.287
OK, yeah.

01:36:08.464 --> 01:36:12.000
I wanna have a baby, and if you can't have
one, then I'm gonna fuck somebody else.

01:36:12.176 --> 01:36:13.920
Are you happy now?

01:36:17.638 --> 01:36:18.884
(whispers)
Get out.

01:36:19.056 --> 01:36:20.931
Get out of my flat.  just get out.

01:36:21.934 --> 01:36:23.559
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off.

01:36:23.727 --> 01:36:25.186
Fuck off!

01:36:25.354 --> 01:36:27.761
- Fuck off out of my place!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:36:27.938 --> 01:36:30.809
-  just go! I don't wont you here.
- Where the fuck am I gonna go?

01:36:30.983 --> 01:36:32.858
I don't care!

01:36:33.027 --> 01:36:34.936
(breathes heavily and sniffs)

01:36:50.708 --> 01:36:52.452
<i>If I go...</i>

01:36:53.668 --> 01:36:58.331
El, if I go, then I'm packing my bags
and I'm leaving for good.

01:36:59.507 --> 01:37:01.547
I mean it. I'm not coming back.

01:37:02.969 --> 01:37:06.503
That's it, we'll be over -
fucked, finished.

01:37:09.057 --> 01:37:11.014
Do you understand?

01:37:11.184 --> 01:37:13.141
(whispers)
Yeah.

01:37:45.421 --> 01:37:47.413
(door slams)

01:37:50.175 --> 01:37:52.927
You've left one tight family
and gone into another tight family.

01:37:53.094 --> 01:37:54.174
(chuckles)

01:37:54.346 --> 01:37:55.543
This will suit.

01:37:55.721 --> 01:37:57.631
- What about you?
- Bet you five pounds we're next.

01:37:57.806 --> 01:37:59.763
You get any nice presents?

01:37:59.933 --> 01:38:01.261
(Shane)
Want some spice?

01:38:01.434 --> 01:38:03.392
(Mark)
That wasn't spicy enough.

01:38:03.561 --> 01:38:05.056
<i>No. No, no, no.</i>

01:38:06.689 --> 01:38:08.729
(overlapping voices)

01:38:09.108 --> 01:38:11.018
I'm willing to admit that.

01:38:11.193 --> 01:38:12.900
- Smoke?

01:38:14.654 --> 01:38:16.694
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:38:17.490 --> 01:38:18.687
You need to...

01:38:19.199 --> 01:38:20.777
- Lovely wedding.
- Yes.

01:38:20.951 --> 01:38:22.611
- (chuckles)
- Yeah.

01:38:22.786 --> 01:38:23.865
<i>I was erm...</i>

01:38:24.037 --> 01:38:28.414
I was sort of hoping that Carly would turn
up in, like, a big white meringue dress...

01:38:28.583 --> 01:38:30.160
- No.
- ..but... (chuckles) ..alas!

01:38:30.334 --> 01:38:33.537
(she chuckles)
How's your girlfriend? Your baby girl?

01:38:33.712 --> 01:38:36.630
- I was looking forward to meeting them.
- I know.

01:38:36.798 --> 01:38:39.418
<i>Yeah, she's... you know...</i>

01:38:42.844 --> 01:38:44.090
<i>Er...</i>

01:38:44.262 --> 01:38:46.468
me and Annelise, we're not..

01:38:46.639 --> 01:38:49.807
We're not together at the moment.
We're taking a bit of a break.

01:38:54.396 --> 01:38:56.970
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's all right, you know.

01:38:57.148 --> 01:38:59.722
It's not erm...
It's not a permanent thing.

01:38:59.901 --> 01:39:03.399
We just... We needed a bit of time to...
to sort of think things over.

01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:06.940
I've been pretty...
pretty stressed lately.

01:39:07.115 --> 01:39:10.532
<i>I was changing job and er...
under pressure and er...</i>

01:39:11.661 --> 01:39:12.989
Yeah, you know.

01:39:17.624 --> 01:39:19.534
Anyway, how's you... you guys?

01:39:19.709 --> 01:39:21.453
Carly said that you weren't...

01:39:21.627 --> 01:39:23.253
You're not with your fella any more?

01:39:23.421 --> 01:39:24.998
Erm...we are...

01:39:25.172 --> 01:39:26.287
(clears throat)

01:39:26.464 --> 01:39:28.505
No, we're not at the moment.

01:39:29.509 --> 01:39:30.967
Right.

01:39:31.135 --> 01:39:33.923
<i>Is that...
ls that a permanent thing, or...?</i>

01:39:34.096 --> 01:39:36.089
<i>Erm...no, no. It's erm...</i>

01:39:37.557 --> 01:39:40.476
We're like you guys, like,
having a bit of a break.

01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:44.260
Yeah, you need that sometimes, don't you?

01:39:46.565 --> 01:39:49.318
You know, if I'm being honest with you...

01:39:50.026 --> 01:39:52.860
- Yeah?
- The baby came as a bit of a shock.

01:39:53.028 --> 01:39:56.397
<i>You know, it wasn't planned,
and er... we just...</i>

01:39:56.573 --> 01:39:59.859
We didn't have that time
to get to know each other.

01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:02.405
You know.

01:40:03.913 --> 01:40:06.119
Anyway, we shall see, eh?

01:40:09.084 --> 01:40:11.041
You look gorgeous as ever, by the way.

01:40:11.211 --> 01:40:12.622
Thank you.

01:40:14.255 --> 01:40:17.671
Erm...shall we go inside
and have the dessert?

01:40:17.841 --> 01:40:19.337
<i>Yes.</i>

01:40:23.638 --> 01:40:25.346
(Carly)
No! No!

01:40:25.514 --> 01:40:26.593
I said no speeches.

01:40:26.765 --> 01:40:30.550
Carly said no speeches,
but this is just a wee toast.

01:40:30.727 --> 01:40:32.139
Here we go.

01:40:33.229 --> 01:40:35.221
Marriage, hm?

01:40:36.024 --> 01:40:37.649
Marriage is not the end.

01:40:38.817 --> 01:40:41.024
But neither is it the beginning.

01:40:41.195 --> 01:40:46.733
A relationship, a couple, has already
been conceived and born.

01:40:47.825 --> 01:40:50.862
<i>Today is a... a grown-up moment.</i>

01:40:51.745 --> 01:40:53.204
Arrangements have been made,

01:40:53.372 --> 01:40:55.447
promises before witnesses,

01:40:57.250 --> 01:41:00.618
a commitment to negotiating life together.

01:41:03.338 --> 01:41:06.589
Inevitably there has been pain...

01:41:08.092 --> 01:41:10.003
was well as joy.

01:41:10.178 --> 01:41:14.258
And there will be new joys and...
and new pains.

01:41:15.390 --> 01:41:19.684
And in the future, from time to time,

01:41:20.728 --> 01:41:22.804
the relationship, the couple,

01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:27.310
will need to be reviewed,
to be reconceived and reborn.

01:41:27.942 --> 01:41:31.109
Coming back together. Rejoining.

01:41:32.446 --> 01:41:34.771
A new togetherness.

01:41:35.908 --> 01:41:38.280
- But worth the effort.
- (ripple of laughter)

01:41:38.451 --> 01:41:44.288
So, please...raise your glasses
and make a toast.

01:41:45.874 --> 01:41:47.534
Vive la difference.

01:41:47.709 --> 01:41:49.500
(Others)
Vive la difference!

01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:51.543
Vive la vie.

01:41:51.712 --> 01:41:52.792
(Others)
Vive la vie.

01:41:52.964 --> 01:41:54.292
Vive l’amour!

01:41:54.465 --> 01:41:56.042
- (chuckling)
- Vive l’amour.

01:41:56.216 --> 01:41:57.414
All right, Dad.

01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:00.800
Thank you, Dad.

01:42:26.784 --> 01:42:28.824
(children's voices outside)

01:42:43.672 --> 01:42:45.749
(Jenny)
Er...have you seen my fags?

01:42:45.925 --> 01:42:47.966
I left them here last night.

01:42:50.428 --> 01:42:51.887
(Zoe)
Tea? Anyone for tea?

01:42:52.054 --> 01:42:53.846
<i>- Oh, I'd love one. I'm...
- No, thanks.</i>

01:42:54.015 --> 01:42:55.722
No? OK.

01:42:55.891 --> 01:42:57.268
Yeah, what's wrong with you?

01:43:32.756 --> 01:43:35.626
I mean, if they had a bit of animal print,
then maybe I could vibe, but...

01:43:35.801 --> 01:43:37.840
What if they were in purple?

01:43:38.427 --> 01:43:41.132
<i>OK, you know when my birthday is, so...</i>

01:43:41.930 --> 01:43:43.388
(chuckling)

01:43:46.184 --> 01:43:47.465
<i>(gasps)</i>

01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:25.639
(voices in background)

01:45:28.770 --> 01:45:30.811
(door opens)

01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:40.111
. Hey-
. Hey-

01:45:45.076 --> 01:45:46.487
Do you want a drink?

01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:47.989
Er...yeah.

01:45:48.162 --> 01:45:49.988
Can I have a black coffee?

01:45:50.163 --> 01:45:51.659
- D-Do you want...
- No, I have one.

01:45:51.832 --> 01:45:52.947
Thanks.

01:45:56.127 --> 01:45:58.997
- How are you?
- Er...yeah, I'm good.

01:45:59.171 --> 01:46:01.128
- Yeah. How about you?
- Good.

01:46:04.468 --> 01:46:05.713
(chuckles)

01:46:06.719 --> 01:46:09.093
- Your hair is shorter.
- Oh, yeah.

01:46:09.263 --> 01:46:11.220
I got it cut for a job interview.

01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:13.016
How did it go?

01:46:13.184 --> 01:46:14.465
It went good.

01:46:14.643 --> 01:46:16.184
I think so. Yeah.

01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:18.562
- Hard to tell, huh?
- Yeah.

01:46:18.730 --> 01:46:20.307
Yeah, you never know.

01:46:23.525 --> 01:46:25.269
Where have you been living?

01:46:25.443 --> 01:46:30.438
Er...I've just been sort of sofa-surfing
at various friends' places and then...

01:46:32.241 --> 01:46:33.699
And now I'm at my dad's.

01:46:33.867 --> 01:46:35.493
How is he?

01:46:35.661 --> 01:46:38.449
He's well. Yeah. Yeah.

01:46:43.167 --> 01:46:44.792
I miss him.

01:46:50.256 --> 01:46:52.083
(sighs)

01:46:52.258 --> 01:46:54.582
And how about you?
How's everything with you?

01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:56.800
Thanks. (sniffs)

01:47:01.891 --> 01:47:03.847
(whispers) I miss you.

01:47:05.144 --> 01:47:07.100
Elena, don't.

01:47:08.814 --> 01:47:10.806
- What are we doing?
- What do you mean?

01:47:10.982 --> 01:47:13.651
(tearful)
I feel so lost.

01:47:17.446 --> 01:47:19.356
I said when I left,
I wasn't gonna come back.

01:47:19.531 --> 01:47:20.776
- I said that.
- I know, I know.

01:47:20.949 --> 01:47:23.274
- Why? Why not?
- Because we broke up, El.

01:47:23.451 --> 01:47:26.453
Because I've been living my life
like we weren't together, OK?

01:47:26.620 --> 01:47:29.407
- Are you in love with someone else?
- No.

01:47:29.581 --> 01:47:30.779
(scoffs)

01:47:33.042 --> 01:47:34.703
<i>(he sighs)</i>

01:47:37.629 --> 01:47:41.046
We could spend our whole life
just looking for what we had.

01:47:43.009 --> 01:47:44.717
- I've gotta go.
- No, what? No, wait, wait.

01:47:44.885 --> 01:47:48.136
- I've got a meeting. Honestly.
- OK.  just stay here a second

01:47:48.305 --> 01:47:49.763
- and talk to me.
- I'm really late.

01:47:49.931 --> 01:47:51.972
just finish the coffee, please.

01:47:58.188 --> 01:48:01.023
OK, so what? What, then?
What now? (sniffs)

01:48:01.191 --> 01:48:02.935
What do we do?

01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:05.979
We don't see each other ever again?
Huh?

01:48:12.951 --> 01:48:18.289
Joke, you said before, and you were right,
but I couldn't see that.

01:48:18.456 --> 01:48:20.781
But you were right.
And I can see that now.

01:48:22.251 --> 01:48:24.290
We already were a family.

01:48:25.629 --> 01:48:27.254
(sniffs)

01:48:29.006 --> 01:48:31.047
I don't want to lose my family.

01:48:33.886 --> 01:48:35.926
- I've got to go.
- No, no, just stay.

01:48:39.348 --> 01:48:40.464
(she sniffles)

01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:49.145
(door shuts)

01:49:23.635 --> 01:49:25.676
You all right, Jake?

01:49:28.556 --> 01:49:29.933
(sniffs)

01:49:42.235 --> 01:49:44.061
We were like you and Mum.

01:49:44.236 --> 01:49:45.315
(sniffs)

01:49:45.487 --> 01:49:47.030
How do you mean?

01:49:47.197 --> 01:49:48.988
We were perfect.

01:49:49.157 --> 01:49:51.198
(Andrew sighs and chuckles)

01:49:56.247 --> 01:49:57.907
Why are you smiling?

01:49:58.581 --> 01:50:00.622
Because your mother
and me were not perfect.

01:50:00.792 --> 01:50:02.867
Not by any stretch of the imagination.

01:50:05.046 --> 01:50:07.501
- You never even argued.
- (scoffs) Oh, we did.

01:50:08.549 --> 01:50:10.339
I never heard you.

01:50:10.508 --> 01:50:12.170
We'd do it when you were in bed.

01:50:12.344 --> 01:50:15.629
We'd yell at each other in the kitchen
in very angry whispers.

01:50:15.804 --> 01:50:16.921
(chuckles)

01:50:17.098 --> 01:50:19.766
And then your mum
wouldn't speck to me for days.

01:50:20.559 --> 01:50:24.010
She was an expert at long,
punishing silences.

01:50:24.854 --> 01:50:26.100
(chuckles)

01:50:27.356 --> 01:50:30.358
(sighs)
Really, Jake, everyone has tough times.

01:50:30.526 --> 01:50:31.937
We had our bad times.

01:50:32.110 --> 01:50:34.684
That's... That's  just the way it is.

01:50:38.783 --> 01:50:40.822
This is different.

01:50:42.619 --> 01:50:44.077
<i>OK.</i>

01:50:54.505 --> 01:50:56.544
I don't know how we'd get back.

01:50:58.257 --> 01:51:00.002
Back to what?

01:51:00.593 --> 01:51:03.214
To what we were. (sighs)

01:51:03.387 --> 01:51:05.462
Jake, it doesn't work like that.

01:51:05.638 --> 01:51:07.715
You can only go forwards.

01:51:08.391 --> 01:51:09.553
That's life -

01:51:09.725 --> 01:51:12.264
the beauty and the tragedy.

01:51:16.773 --> 01:51:19.311
Jake, your mum died when she was 38.

01:51:19.483 --> 01:51:22.271
There's nothing perfect about that,
nothing at all.

01:51:28.867 --> 01:51:30.907
Do you still love her?

01:51:35.914 --> 01:51:37.373
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.950
And what if you're never able
to have children together?

01:51:43.305 --> 01:51:49.317
