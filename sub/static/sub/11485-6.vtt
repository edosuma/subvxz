00:09.626 --> 00:11.355
- Hi.
- Hi, Uncle Charlie.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.055
How was your game?

00:13.129 --> 00:15.859
The musician's softball league is a joke.

00:15.932 --> 00:18.400
Guys trying to catch stuff that isn't there.

00:20.236 --> 00:23.228
People throwing up on
an easy double play ball.

00:23.640 --> 00:25.073
So why do you go?

00:25.141 --> 00:27.905
There is an open bar,
and they let me pitch.

00:28.378 --> 00:29.743
I've got to get dressed.

00:29.813 --> 00:33.112
I was going to throw this toast out,
but it's yours if you want it.

00:34.484 --> 00:36.816
When did I become the family dog?

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074

00:45.695 --> 00:49.529
- Jake, what's this, a phone message?
- Yeah. Some lady called for you.

00:50.100 --> 00:52.034
Who? I can't read your writing.

00:54.938 --> 00:57.270
"You're a big selfish jerk. "

01:01.211 --> 01:05.113
Okay, I know who this is. Amy.

01:07.383 --> 01:10.147
- Probably Amy.
- Yup, Amy.

01:10.286 --> 01:13.380
- She wants you to call her back.
- Yeah, that'll happen.

01:13.456 --> 01:16.619
- Why not?
- Because I never said I'd call her back.

01:18.394 --> 01:19.793
Remember this, Jake,

01:20.063 --> 01:22.930
never make promises to women
that you don't intend to keep.

01:22.999 --> 01:25.934
- And you know how you do that?
- Always keep my promises?

01:26.102 --> 01:27.933
That might work.

01:28.605 --> 01:31.301
A better way is never make promises.

01:31.908 --> 01:35.969
- What happens if Amy calls again?
- Okay, I'm glad you asked that.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.576
When the phone rings
at Uncle Charlie's house,

01:38.648 --> 01:42.106
we don't just willy-nilly pick up
the receiver and answer it. No.

01:43.987 --> 01:46.751
What we do is we check the caller I.D.,

01:48.758 --> 01:52.023
and only pick up if we want
to talk to that person.

01:52.128 --> 01:54.995
- Like Mom?
- That depends.

01:55.932 --> 01:58.196
Your mom, yes. My mom, no.

01:59.636 --> 02:01.797
How come you don't want
to talk to your mom?

02:02.105 --> 02:05.268
I'll tell you all about that
when you are old enough to drink.

02:06.109 --> 02:07.838
What if I want to talk to your mom?

02:07.944 --> 02:11.710
Okay, that kind of attitude is going
to break down the whole system.

02:27.197 --> 02:30.462
- Dad, no! Don't pick up the phone!
- Why not?

02:30.834 --> 02:33.359
It might be your mom. Or a woman.

02:36.439 --> 02:38.873
It's Amy again. She just won't give up.

02:40.877 --> 02:42.208
Charlie.

02:44.981 --> 02:48.644
Look, I appreciate your need for privacy,
but I think you're sending a bad message

02:48.718 --> 02:50.686
to my son about how to deal with women.

02:50.753 --> 02:51.879
How so?

02:51.955 --> 02:53.889
He thinks it's okay
to avoid somebody because

02:53.957 --> 02:56.517
the conversation might be uncomfortable.

02:59.162 --> 03:00.390
Charlie!

03:01.231 --> 03:03.290
Okay, that's not funny.

03:04.367 --> 03:07.564
Look, if I am teaching
the kid anything, it's honesty.

03:07.670 --> 03:11.629
Really? Walk me through
the lesson, Charlie. Educate me.

03:12.242 --> 03:16.144
Okay. I tell women upfront I'm not looking
for a long-term relationship.

03:16.212 --> 03:19.579
If they don't believe me, or
they're determined to change my mind,

03:19.649 --> 03:21.549
I have a right to avoid that conversation.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.813
And the phone company obviously
agrees with me,

03:23.887 --> 03:26.720
otherwise they wouldn't have invented
caller I.D.

03:28.191 --> 03:29.419
Uncle Charlie,

03:29.492 --> 03:33.019
what if somebody you don't want to talk
to comes over instead of calls?

03:33.096 --> 03:36.190
- Just tell them I'm not here.
- He's not here, Grandma!

03:39.202 --> 03:41.170
Mom, you just surprised me.

03:41.237 --> 03:44.229
- You should have called first.
- Charlie, I call constantly.

03:44.340 --> 03:46.205
You screen like an Olympic drug tester.

03:48.278 --> 03:49.711
I'm happy to see you, Mom.

03:49.779 --> 03:53.442
I don't believe you, sweetheart.
But at least you care enough to lie.

03:53.549 --> 03:56.950
I care enough to lie.
You just caught me off guard.

03:58.054 --> 03:59.385
So, what are you doing here?

03:59.455 --> 04:03.482
I'm showing a house up the beach, and I
thought, while I am in the neighborhood,

04:03.559 --> 04:06.187
I would drop off a gift for my grandson.

04:06.296 --> 04:08.457
You are writing him a check?

04:08.765 --> 04:13.099
- What kind of gift is that?
- You told me he likes transformer toys.

04:13.703 --> 04:17.434
This check transforms into
any toy he wants.

04:20.108 --> 04:21.440
Thanks, Grandma!

04:21.543 --> 04:23.944
Is that all? Don't I get a hug?

04:25.415 --> 04:28.009
Your grandma loves you so much.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.744
Grandma's got to go to work.

04:31.387 --> 04:35.050
Nobody just gives her checks. Walk me.

04:37.727 --> 04:41.629
In case you are at all interested, I have
been seeing a man. And

04:41.731 --> 04:43.460
he just may be the one.

04:44.033 --> 04:46.297
- Five time's the charm.
- Four.

04:46.936 --> 04:49.905
- But, what about the guy...
- That was annulled.

04:49.973 --> 04:52.703
Boy! Are we going to have a new daddy?

04:52.942 --> 04:54.705
Bite me, Charlie.

04:56.579 --> 05:00.208
I would like to have a dinner
at the house so you boys can meet him.

05:00.283 --> 05:01.614
What night is good for you?

05:02.552 --> 05:06.283
- What night do you want us?
- I asked you first.

05:08.925 --> 05:13.726
Jake's here weekends, it's Thursday.
Check my calendar.

05:13.796 --> 05:14.956
Don't really want to.

05:20.269 --> 05:22.669
Tomorrow night, 7:00.

05:22.939 --> 05:26.102
It's very important to me,
and I hope you can make it.

05:26.843 --> 05:30.335
But I will certainly understand
if you are too busy for your mother.

05:34.784 --> 05:36.411
You know what she is trying to do.

05:36.486 --> 05:38.784
- Of course I know.
- But maybe one of us should go.

05:38.855 --> 05:40.948
- Sure. You go, I look bad.
- What do you care?

05:41.024 --> 05:42.286
- I don't care.
- Then don't go.

05:42.358 --> 05:44.155
- I'm not going.
- I'm not going, either.

05:44.260 --> 05:47.024
- I'm not staying.
- We'll eat, we'll go.

05:47.130 --> 05:49.496
- No coffee, no dessert.
- We can't be rude.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.261
Watch me. I refuse to let that woman...

05:52.502 --> 05:55.869
- Hi, Mom.
- Better late than never.

05:56.305 --> 06:00.139
- We're right on time.
- I was referring to the big picture.

06:01.010 --> 06:02.136
Hi, Grandma.

06:02.211 --> 06:05.442
And look, you brought Jake
to meet my new beau.

06:06.115 --> 06:09.846
Come here, sweetheart. Now, tonight you
and I are going to play a game.

06:10.186 --> 06:12.552
And the name of the game is,

06:13.222 --> 06:15.349
"Don't call me Grandma. "

06:16.359 --> 06:17.519
What kind of game is that?

06:17.593 --> 06:22.155
It's a fun game, honey. It only
has one rule. You have to call me Evelyn.

06:22.832 --> 06:24.356
- Okay.
- Try it.

06:26.102 --> 06:28.798
- Evelyn.
- See? We're having fun already.

06:30.440 --> 06:34.274
Look, you didn't bring wine. Good.
Too many people bring wine.

06:38.448 --> 06:41.940
Tommy, darling, I would like you
to meet my sons.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.676
This is Charlie.

06:43.786 --> 06:45.310
- Charlie.
- Hi, Tommy. How are you?

06:45.388 --> 06:47.117
- Alan.
- Hello.

06:47.190 --> 06:49.988
- And this is Jake.
- Yes, I am, Evelyn.

06:52.695 --> 06:54.526
Let's not beat it to death, okay?

06:54.797 --> 06:56.287
Good to meet you, Jake.

06:57.033 --> 07:00.730
There you are. Boys, this
is Tommy's daughter, Olivia.

07:01.671 --> 07:04.868
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hi there, stranger.

07:05.875 --> 07:07.467
Do you two know each other?

07:07.743 --> 07:10.405
- I thought I knew him.
- Oh, no.

07:12.648 --> 07:15.116
Okay. Who would like a drink?
I would like a drink.

07:15.184 --> 07:19.553
Charlie, come help me make the drinks.
Alan, talk to Olivia. Alan was a cesarean.

07:24.327 --> 07:29.355
It wasn't medically necessary.
She just had a function to go to.

07:31.868 --> 07:35.531
Is there anyone in the 310 area code
that you have not mounted?

07:37.540 --> 07:41.601
Come on, we went out a couple of times.
She assumed it was an exclusive thing,

07:41.677 --> 07:44.510
and when she found out it wasn't,
she got a little upset.

07:48.584 --> 07:52.452
Anyway, Tommy seems like a real nice
guy. I am very happy for you.

07:52.688 --> 07:57.557
- Goodnight.
- Charles. You are not going anywhere.

07:57.894 --> 08:01.386
This man is very important to me.
We are going to have a nice dinner.

08:01.464 --> 08:05.025
You're going to be charming,
and Tommy will remain oblivious

08:05.101 --> 08:07.433
to the fact that you defiled his daughter.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.104
She wasn't exactly filed when I met her.

08:12.708 --> 08:15.700
You don't know how lucky you
are to have a mother like Evelyn.

08:15.778 --> 08:20.215
She is the warmest, most affectionate,
giving woman I have ever known.

08:20.616 --> 08:21.844
That's my mom.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.853
Call her Evelyn. That's the game.

08:26.455 --> 08:29.083
You play your game, I'll play mine.

08:30.259 --> 08:34.855
- Here we are.
- There's my little karaoke cupcake.

08:34.964 --> 08:37.956
Tommy, you are not telling that story.

08:38.301 --> 08:40.633
We took one of
those little cruises to Alaska.

08:40.736 --> 08:43.705
Glaciers and whales, I didn't quite
see the point of it all.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.765
But during the evening there
was this karaoke competition.

08:46.876 --> 08:49.538
And as you know,
I'm no stranger to the stage.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.637
Yes Mom, I know.

08:51.781 --> 08:52.805
Excuse me.

08:53.749 --> 08:56.912
Anyway, you know how I
have always sung

08:56.986 --> 09:00.513
<i>These Boots Are Made for Walking,
with my little dance routine.</i>

09:00.590 --> 09:02.990
Yes, Mom. I have it on my wedding video.

09:04.560 --> 09:07.256
- So, how've you been?
- You know...

09:07.630 --> 09:08.995
No, I don't know, Charlie.

09:09.098 --> 09:13.091
When people don't return your calls, it's
kind of hard to know how they have been.

09:13.169 --> 09:15.137
Look, I know this
is an awkward coincidence.

09:15.338 --> 09:16.600
It's no coincidence.

09:16.672 --> 09:20.403
When my father told me who he
was dating, I made a point of being here.

09:21.844 --> 09:24.005
You can't argue the awkward part, right?

09:24.113 --> 09:28.345
So, I am zipping up my boots,
and I am about to go onstage

09:28.451 --> 09:34.151
<i>when this hausfrau from Tone-Deaf, Texas,
gets up and starts singing my song.</i>

09:34.924 --> 09:37.415
I think you can imagine
how unhappy I was.

09:37.526 --> 09:39.494
Don't tell me to calm down.
You lied to me.

09:39.595 --> 09:42.860
I did not lie to you. And you could
have told me this on the phone.

09:42.965 --> 09:45.433
- You never answer your phone.
- Of course not.

09:45.501 --> 09:48.129
Who wants to have this conversation?

09:49.272 --> 09:54.369
So, I sidled up to the woman and

09:55.678 --> 09:59.011
really very smoothly turned
it in to a duet,

09:59.649 --> 10:02.709
when suddenly she starts pushing me.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.650
- You said I was very special to you.
- You were.

10:05.855 --> 10:09.848
- Yeah, me and three other women.
- I said you were special, not unique.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.724
Drop dead, you bastard.

10:17.166 --> 10:18.190
Excuse me!

10:28.177 --> 10:29.576
In my defense...

10:32.248 --> 10:33.306
Screw it!

10:35.685 --> 10:39.314
Finish the story, Evelyn.
Did you push her back?

10:46.429 --> 10:48.590
Stupid musician's league.

10:50.166 --> 10:55.536
I don't know why I bother. Get this.
Tie score, we are down to our last out.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.506
Our best hitter, Billy Kresky's up.

10:58.574 --> 11:01.338
The bases are loaded, and so is Kresky.

11:02.678 --> 11:06.205
His whole family is standing behind
the backstop, crying and pleading,

11:06.282 --> 11:09.012
"Go back to rehab, Daddy, we love you!"

11:10.920 --> 11:13.013
Needless to say, he choked.

11:14.423 --> 11:16.914
Charlie, I think we have got
a bigger problem.

11:17.126 --> 11:20.459
- Our mother is missing.
- Don't try to cheer me up.

11:21.764 --> 11:24.858
I am serious. I called her home, her car,
her cell, nothing.

11:25.468 --> 11:28.369
Did you check with the captain
of the flying monkeys?

11:28.437 --> 11:29.495
Charlie!

11:29.572 --> 11:33.372
She's probably just sulking because I
screwed up her dinner party last week.

11:33.442 --> 11:37.776
That's what I thought, too. Except I called
her office and they haven't heard from her.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.040
- Okay. That's weird.
- Yeah.

11:39.115 --> 11:42.312
I think somebody needs to go over there
and make sure she's okay.

11:42.418 --> 11:45.581
Good idea. You do that
and I'll stay here in case she calls.

11:46.789 --> 11:49.280
Why don't you go
and I will stay here in case she calls?

11:49.392 --> 11:51.485
No, I got to be honest,
I like my idea better.

11:51.594 --> 11:53.994
- I'm not going there alone.
- I'm not going at all.

11:54.096 --> 11:57.554
What do you want to bet she ran off
to Vegas to marry this Tommy guy?

11:57.633 --> 11:59.225
If that's all this is, great.

11:59.301 --> 12:02.634
The only down side would be
that you slept with our stepsister.

12:02.738 --> 12:04.569
Hadn't thought of that. Kinda sexy.

12:04.940 --> 12:07.306
- Kinda sick.
- I'm saying.

12:08.844 --> 12:10.573
Look, there is no one here. Let's go.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.307
No. I want to take a look.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.447
- You have a key?
- I'm the good son.

12:21.323 --> 12:22.585
Mom?

12:25.428 --> 12:27.988
Okay, she's not here. Let's go.

12:31.867 --> 12:33.994
Okay, she's here. Let's go.

12:35.471 --> 12:36.495
Charlie.

12:36.605 --> 12:39.938
Mom, are you all right? Why
haven't you been answering the phone?

12:40.009 --> 12:44.309
I didn't want to burden anyone with
my grief over the late Tommy Pearson.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.370
Tommy died?

12:49.351 --> 12:50.943
He is dead to me.

12:53.389 --> 12:56.825
- Okay, what happened?
- He dumped me.

12:58.060 --> 12:59.322
Mom, I am sorry.

12:59.395 --> 13:03.331
The thing between me and his daughter
happened years before you met the guy.

13:03.399 --> 13:06.232
This has nothing to do with you, Charlie.

13:06.335 --> 13:08.303
God, you're a narcissist.

13:10.339 --> 13:15.072
No, Tommy left me for some fresh-faced
45-year-old bimbo.

13:17.146 --> 13:19.637
I am sorry, Mom.
I know he meant a lot to you.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.342
Yeah. I'm sorry, too.

13:21.417 --> 13:23.851
Thank you, Alan. Nice try, Charlie.

13:26.155 --> 13:29.352
Now if you will both please leave,
I'd like to be alone.

13:31.260 --> 13:32.852
We understand.

13:34.196 --> 13:37.097
Charlie, wait! We can't just leave her here.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.725
Fine. Where do you want to leave her?

13:41.070 --> 13:45.029
Mom, why don't you come back and stay
at Charlie's house for a few days?

13:45.107 --> 13:46.904
- How is that?
- Time out.

13:47.076 --> 13:51.376
Don't worry, Charlie. I have no desire
to impose on your life.

13:52.014 --> 13:54.039
Appreciate it. All right then, chin up.

13:57.052 --> 13:59.748
- You sure, Mom?
- Yes. Thank you, Alan.

14:00.289 --> 14:01.381
Okay.

14:04.860 --> 14:06.088
God!

14:10.266 --> 14:11.290
So close.

14:18.874 --> 14:20.705
How long is she going to sit out there?

14:20.776 --> 14:23.643
I don't know.
I've never seen her this depressed.

14:23.746 --> 14:27.238
Somebody's got to go out there
and show her a little love and support.

14:28.984 --> 14:32.215
- Jake!
- Yeah.

14:34.890 --> 14:36.949
Why don't you go out
and talk to Grandma?

14:37.660 --> 14:40.254
- Why?
- Because she's a little lonely.

14:40.996 --> 14:45.433
- She's your mom.
- Don't sass me. Go talk to Grandma.

14:51.807 --> 14:55.607
- Hi, Evelyn.
- Please, sweetheart, call me Grandma.

14:55.778 --> 14:59.407
- But what about the game?
- Games are for children, Jake.

15:05.487 --> 15:09.821
Uncle Charlie got me a metal detector and
sometimes I find cool stuff on the beach.

15:10.159 --> 15:13.287
That's nice. But you know, that cool stuff

15:13.596 --> 15:17.293
is stuff that other people lost
and will never get back.

15:18.300 --> 15:23.101
Trinkets and treasures buried
beneath the lonely sands of time.

15:23.539 --> 15:28.636
- Yeah, but finders, keepers, right?
- And losers, weepers.

15:34.316 --> 15:38.377
- He's getting killed out there.
- It's all right, he's not crying yet.

15:39.888 --> 15:42.288
Somebody needs to go out there
and back him up.

15:42.791 --> 15:44.986
$10 says it's not me.

15:51.133 --> 15:53.363
What's going on with you...

15:57.539 --> 16:00.167
The kid's got a bladder the size of a pea.

16:01.644 --> 16:03.805
You were a bed wetter, if I recall.

16:17.159 --> 16:20.890
You know what Jake would
really get a kick out of?

16:21.597 --> 16:24.532
If you could sing
while Charlie played the piano.

16:25.768 --> 16:27.531
No, Alan. I couldn't.

16:27.603 --> 16:31.699
- Besides, Charlie always hated that.
- Are you kidding? It was his idea.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.589
Pick it up, Charlie.
We are walking, not crawling.

16:54.763 --> 16:56.788
"Are you ready, boots? Start walking. "

17:05.708 --> 17:08.233
- Okay, now.
- One more time.

17:35.904 --> 17:37.997
Mom, you okay?

17:38.240 --> 17:40.037
Yeah, go back to bed, Charlie.

17:40.776 --> 17:41.936
No, I'm up.

17:42.411 --> 17:44.504
It's hard to sleep after a big show.

17:47.182 --> 17:48.581
Thank you for that.

17:49.351 --> 17:51.114
Brought back some nice memories.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.682
You still got some chops, Mom.

17:53.756 --> 17:56.623
You were rushing
the tempo towards the end there.

17:56.692 --> 18:00.992
Sorry, I always get a little carried away
when you do the James Brown medley.

18:04.299 --> 18:05.630
Charlie.

18:07.369 --> 18:10.338
Your mother's a real sad case, isn't she?

18:10.806 --> 18:13.434
You'll get over him. There's other guys.

18:14.977 --> 18:18.811
He never even called.
Never even said goodbye.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.943
Maybe he was scared.

18:25.287 --> 18:26.379
Of what?

18:27.890 --> 18:30.620
I knew there were no promises, no strings.

18:30.726 --> 18:33.786
That doesn't mean there
can't be common courtesy.

18:39.168 --> 18:42.797
To think I mean that little to him?

18:48.911 --> 18:50.811
It will be okay, Mom.

18:52.514 --> 18:54.641
You still got me and Alan.

18:55.150 --> 18:59.814
Charlie, please. I know how difficult things
are between us.

19:01.523 --> 19:02.990
Maybe it's my fault.

19:04.159 --> 19:06.320
It's not all your fault.

19:07.396 --> 19:11.162
I probably haven't been the best son.

19:15.838 --> 19:18.705
I just want you
to know that in my way,

19:19.608 --> 19:21.542
I want you to be happy and...

19:25.447 --> 19:26.675
I love you.

19:32.454 --> 19:34.115
I guess I'll go pack.

19:35.123 --> 19:37.523
- Why?
- I'm going home.

19:38.293 --> 19:42.923
- In the middle of the night?
- Charlie, you just said you loved me.

19:47.236 --> 19:49.295
You could only screw it up from here.

20:17.165 --> 20:18.291
Donkey Kong!

20:20.269 --> 20:22.464
<i>- Danke Schoen.
- Danke Schoen.</i>

20:22.537 --> 20:26.530
<i>Danke Schoen. B flat. One, two, three.</i>

20:54.136 --> 20:55.330
