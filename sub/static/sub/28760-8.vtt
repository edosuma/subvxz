my neck out

29:02.430 --> 29:03.556
on your behalf,

29:03.610 --> 29:06.124
but if this thing goes south,

29:06.170 --> 29:09.173
it's the last time we'll meet.

into witness protection

29:23.320 --> 29:25.049
all by his lonesome.

29:25.110 --> 29:26.179
So there's still time.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.014
The US. attorney has given him

29:28.070 --> 29:29.844
48 hours to decide:

29:29.890 --> 29:31.585

29:31.630 --> 29:34.281
or 30 years
for attempted distribution.

I'd wager he'll give you up
rather than his freedom.

29:39.250 --> 29:40.945
I need to get close to him.

29:40.990 --> 29:42.469
That's gonna be difficult.

this afternoon,

they put him
in protective custody.

29:47.130 --> 29:49.644
Is there any wayyou can get to him?

29:55.920 --> 30:00.220
There is one option,

30:00.270 --> 30:01.874
but it's rislq,

30:01.930 --> 30:04.319

Uh, I got a man who works
as a guard.

He can help to facilitate
your plan.
