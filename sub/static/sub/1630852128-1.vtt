00:11.094 --> 00:13.722
When it comes to chocolate,
it's a whole 'nother world.

00:13.805 --> 00:17.350
The idea that you take this raw ingredient
and create sculptures, structures,

00:17.434 --> 00:19.936
it's different
than any other medium out there.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.938
I love to eat it mostly.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.774
I've been in this industry
for 21 years now,

00:24.858 --> 00:28.570
and I've seen a lot of things,
but you see this guy on social media,

00:28.653 --> 00:30.572
then you see the work,
and it's impeccable.

00:30.655 --> 00:33.658
Amaury? He's a genius.
He's a chocolate genius.

00:34.826 --> 00:37.245
Every time that he posts a video,
they go viral.

00:38.371 --> 00:41.207
The ability to craft that
out of chocolate,

00:41.291 --> 00:43.001
to be very frank, it's rare.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.337
It's a pterodactyl! Oh my God!

00:47.714 --> 00:50.592
My first job in Paris as an exec
was when I was 21 years old.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.304
It's just hanging there.
It's chocolate that's hanging.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.264
He's the master of illusion.

00:57.098 --> 01:00.852
I'm actually a teacher in my own academy,
The Pastry Academy in Las Vegas.

01:00.935 --> 01:03.229
I'm, like, literally
in Willy Wonka's factory.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.023
This is a school of chocolate.

01:05.106 --> 01:07.901
I will be teaching,
testing you, and challenging you

01:07.984 --> 01:09.569
on your pastry and chocolate knowledge.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.988
-Are you feeling up to the challenge?
-Yes.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.531
-Yes, Chef.
-You should run.

01:14.783 --> 01:17.410
As much as you want
to say it's not a competition, it is.

01:19.496 --> 01:22.624
The prize is, like, wow.

01:22.707 --> 01:24.918
Total value of $100,000.

01:25.001 --> 01:27.670
-You did not expect that.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.255
Gotta do what it takes to win.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.175
The winner
of <i>School of Chocolate</i> is…

01:48.441 --> 01:49.275
Hello.

01:49.359 --> 01:52.153
-Hello, Chef.
-Welcome, everyone. Welcome to the school.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.823
It was just like seeing an idol.

01:54.906 --> 01:58.535
You just want to make a squeal
or something like…

01:58.618 --> 02:03.373
I kept it together, you know.
I grab… grabbed the table for stability.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.791
My name is Amaury Guichon.

02:04.874 --> 02:07.710
I know it's weird to pronounce,
but do your best.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.964
I feel like he might've winked at me
when he walked in.

02:11.589 --> 02:14.926
Maybe it was just me?
Got a little warm when he walked in?

02:15.009 --> 02:17.804
I know that you are already professionals,

02:17.887 --> 02:19.180
executive chefs,

02:19.264 --> 02:20.807
business owners,

02:20.890 --> 02:23.768
eager to step up and learn new skills.

02:23.852 --> 02:24.936
Over this course,

02:25.019 --> 02:28.189
you will be taught many things
which you've never learned before.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.358
People do things one way for many years.

02:30.441 --> 02:32.443
I'm gonna ask you
to see things differently.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.905
Innovation is about seeing things
from a different perspective.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.159
Last time I was in school,
I just squeezed by…

02:39.242 --> 02:40.994

…and, um, I'm nervous.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.204
I've been in this industry
for a long time.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.873
I taught myself a lot of tricks.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.709
Am I gonna get yelled at
for doing some of those tricks?

02:47.792 --> 02:48.710
I don't know.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.379
But I'm super excited to be able to learn.

02:51.462 --> 02:52.797
At the end of the course,

02:52.881 --> 02:55.091
the student with the best overall grade

02:55.175 --> 02:59.053
will be given a special award,
and this award could change your life.

03:01.681 --> 03:05.894
Yes, this is a school, there's a prize,
and we all want that prize.

03:06.603 --> 03:09.272
The other competitors
should be watching out for me.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.733
I laugh a lot,

03:11.816 --> 03:14.235
and I look like I don't know a lot,

03:14.319 --> 03:16.070
but they don't know what is coming.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.742
My two fabulous assistants,
Carolyn and Devin,

03:20.825 --> 03:24.120
will be here to provide help and guidance
all the way through the course.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.247
Let's get started. Are you excited?

03:26.331 --> 03:27.749
-Yes, Chef.
-Come forward.

03:30.335 --> 03:33.338
Today we're going to discuss pastry,

03:33.421 --> 03:36.090
and the next task
will be all about chocolate.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.509
Oh, yeah.
Definitely gonna need that.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.054
Let me introduce you
to your first pastry exercise.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.347
Oh, wow.

03:43.765 --> 03:48.519
Creating a pastry without an existing mold
and turning it into an illusion.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.732
This is not really a pastry.

03:54.317 --> 03:58.029
This is a notebook.
That's not really an illusion either.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.448
But this, this is a lemon pie.

04:00.531 --> 04:01.532
-Okay.
-Oh.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.117
-Wow.
-Oh, my God.

04:04.744 --> 04:09.749
The challenge, it's how to craft something
without using any premade mold.

04:09.832 --> 04:14.087
Molds help you create something that
everyone is tying to achieve in pastry,

04:14.170 --> 04:15.129
which is perfection.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.591
You get the perfect curvature,
you get the perfect angles.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.551
Been in this industry
for about ten years now,

04:20.635 --> 04:24.514
and trying to create a pastry
without a preexisting mold

04:24.597 --> 04:27.016
is a little bit mind-blowing.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.311
I told myself, if I wanna do
something like that and don't have a mold,

04:30.395 --> 04:32.313
how can I come up
with something like this?

04:32.397 --> 04:36.025
And it's with this state of mind
that I was able to craft things

04:36.109 --> 04:38.403
that look a bit different
from your usual pastry.

04:38.486 --> 04:41.322
In order to push things to their maximum,

04:41.406 --> 04:44.117
this lemon pie can actually write.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.661
-No.
-Oh my God.

04:46.744 --> 04:50.540
To create the tip of the pencil,
black cocoa butter,

04:50.623 --> 04:53.459
which is the reason
why I can also use it and write with it.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.712
-So good.
-"Good luck" is right.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.214
-No pressure. My cue to go.

05:00.091 --> 05:01.968
I mean, he picked up a pencil
and wrote with it,

05:02.051 --> 05:05.680
that's made out of chocolate.
I have not seen that.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.474
I would like Mellisa to try it,

05:08.558 --> 05:10.643
and… and tell them what you feel.

05:10.727 --> 05:13.354
-Like, just bite into it?
-Yeah, go for it. It's yours.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.274
-Oh…
-It's fine. It's messy. Pastry is messy.

05:18.568 --> 05:19.902
It's fine. It's fine.

05:21.112 --> 05:21.946
Hmm.

05:23.698 --> 05:24.824
-Is it?
-Yeah.

05:25.450 --> 05:30.246
The lemon cream is super citrusy,
then you have the crunch in the middle.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.914
It's nice. It's not firm at all,

05:31.998 --> 05:35.376
which is surprising
because we're mixing two different worlds.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.628
In pastry, it's super secretive.

05:37.712 --> 05:41.382
If you know the trick, you don't tell.
You don't want anybody to do the trick.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.886
And so for here
to be this treasure trove of information,

05:44.969 --> 05:47.180
this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.974
I'm gonna demonstrate the pencil mold.

05:50.058 --> 05:54.937
With just a few acetate sheets
which are just plastic flexible sheets.

05:55.021 --> 05:58.941
Let me start with the frame of it,
which is a perfect hexagon.

05:59.025 --> 06:03.237
I cut some foam board,
and I'm going to push this on

06:03.321 --> 06:07.200
so it will keep the right shape
when we start pouring the chocolate in.

06:07.283 --> 06:11.788
It is just white chocolate
with a little bit of yellow coloration.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.458
The key of using chocolate,
it's the thinner the better.

06:15.541 --> 06:19.379
You don't want it to take away
from the actual taste and texture.

06:19.462 --> 06:24.675
So we're taking our tip and the core,
and we're going to glue them together.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.136
Melting it down, just for it to fit.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.890
Once you see the trick,
you're like, "Oh, well, duh," right?

06:30.973 --> 06:32.809
And there we go. We have our shell.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.769
Seal it up, and it's a wrap.

06:34.852 --> 06:36.604
-It's so good.
-Fabulous.

06:36.687 --> 06:37.730
Thank you.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.608
You cannot, especially as a pastry chef,

06:40.691 --> 06:44.362
you cannot not look at that
and think, "Holy crap."

06:47.573 --> 06:48.950
You have four and a half hours

06:49.033 --> 06:52.578
to come up with your own creative design
without using any preexisting mold.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.331
The theme of your choice,
but it has to be an illusion.

06:55.415 --> 06:59.085
You're gonna be judged on creativity,
flavor, and texture combination.

06:59.168 --> 07:02.839
This is our first pastry exercise,
and I want you to go crazy with it.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.132
Are you ready?

07:04.215 --> 07:05.550
-<i>Oui</i>, Chef.
-Yes.

07:05.633 --> 07:06.968
Let's do it. Go.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.145
All righty, caramel time.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.521
Here we go.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.317
My passion for pastries
started at a very young age.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.278
Since I've had my Easy-Bake Oven,

07:25.361 --> 07:28.781
I've been in the kitchen, uh,
whipping up desserts.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.242
Straight from high school,
I went to culinary school,

07:31.325 --> 07:34.537
so it's been
a pretty amazing 14 years already.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.205
-Stephanie.
-Chef.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.541
-How are you feeling?
-I'm feeling excited.

07:38.624 --> 07:43.004
My concept was to create,
um, like, an aloe vera plant in a pot.

07:43.087 --> 07:47.258
My flavor profile is gonna be
a chocolate-banana, cashew butter.

07:47.341 --> 07:48.176
Okay.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.261
-The pot is chocolate.
-Correct.

07:50.344 --> 07:52.763
-And the cake is hidden inside?
-Of course, yeah.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.516
-That's clever. Good job.
-Thank you. Thanks.

07:56.267 --> 08:00.062
I'm nervous I might've bit off more than
I could chew for this first challenge.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.691
But my grandpa, Lucky, always told me,

08:03.774 --> 08:05.359
"Go big or go home."

08:05.443 --> 08:08.738
And so I'm taking that with me,
'cause… You know?

08:08.821 --> 08:10.531
I'm going in with my eggs.

08:20.124 --> 08:23.211
Can I bug you a moment
and ask you what you want to do?

08:23.294 --> 08:26.172
-Yeah. I'm gonna do a flashlight.
-All right, fun.

08:26.255 --> 08:29.217
Yeah. I'm gonna make the tubes
out of the acetate,

08:29.300 --> 08:30.760
then I'm gonna cut this piece

08:30.843 --> 08:35.556
and use part of this to fit into here,
and then I'm gonna meld the two together.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.934
Outside of the box thinking. I like it.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.977
Basically, what he's asking us to do is

08:40.061 --> 08:43.314
to stop thinking the way
that we have been trained to think

08:43.397 --> 08:45.233
and try something new.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.985
In my career, which spans 20 years,

08:48.069 --> 08:50.488
I've never been, like,
challenged in that way

08:50.571 --> 08:55.451
to find kind of that inner genie almost.
I'm pretty pumped up for the challenge.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.376
Juan, can I ask you
what you're planning on doing today?

09:03.459 --> 09:07.713
Yes, I'm gonna be doing a<i> perinola.</i>
I forgot how you say it in English.

09:07.797 --> 09:11.384
-I think it's, um, de… de… dreidel?
-Okay.

09:11.467 --> 09:12.969
So, it's a Jewish toy,

09:13.052 --> 09:16.973
but in Colombia
we actually use it also as a toy.

09:17.056 --> 09:20.643
My goal is to, like, hopefully,
actually make it even to work

09:20.726 --> 09:22.103
that you can twist it too.

09:22.186 --> 09:25.064
So, it's creative and interactive.
Very cool.

09:25.648 --> 09:29.318
I am originally from Colombia.
I came from a family of doctors, so,

09:29.402 --> 09:32.697
since little, everybody wanted me to be
a doctor but that was not for me.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.616
I told my parents pastry is my passion,
it's what I wanna do.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.286
They were really sad,
really disappointed, really angry.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.871
They actually took it worse
than me coming out as gay.

09:48.713 --> 09:52.008
I don't think I'm as well-known
as maybe some of the other chefs here.

09:52.091 --> 09:58.306
I guess, I'm trying to prove it. Maybe…
Maybe to myself and definitely to, um…

09:59.765 --> 10:01.976
The world who may judge me?

10:03.019 --> 10:06.564
I'm not just a stripper from Baton Rouge.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.774
I stripped through culinary school.

10:08.858 --> 10:12.570
It cost a lot of money and I was,
like, looking for jobs, applying for jobs,

10:12.653 --> 10:16.824
and nobody was, like, hiring me.
And my bills were, like, piling up.

10:16.907 --> 10:20.244
So, I was like, okay,
something's got to get done.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.580
-I do feel like I'm the underdog.
-How are you?

10:22.663 --> 10:24.707
-Oh, just jolly.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.793
-My plan is to do a rolling pin. Uh-huh.
-Rolling pin?

10:27.877 --> 10:31.714
What I like about your design is when you
showed me the sketch, I knew what it was.

10:31.797 --> 10:32.673
Okay, great.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.259
If it tastes good
and the illusion is successful,

10:35.343 --> 10:37.261
and you didn't use any mold, then you win.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.096
-Okay?

10:39.180 --> 10:41.390
Just, like, blew my world.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.851
Thank you, Chef.
He just made my life so much easier.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.061
Was over here stressing.

10:45.561 --> 10:50.024
I normally think less of myself,
that's part of me and my overanalyzing.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.984
I'm in therapy for that.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.987
Oh, I'm so excited now. Go, Tyricia.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.031
Go, Tyricia. Go, Tyricia.

11:03.371 --> 11:06.332
Chefs, you have three hours left
for your exercise.

11:06.415 --> 11:08.501
Thank you.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.048
I'm making my take
on a hazelnut latte.

11:14.131 --> 11:17.677
It's gonna be in a pour-over coffee mug
kind of thing.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.846
I spent a lot of time making the molds
because that's the most crucial part,

11:20.930 --> 11:22.807
getting my shape, uh, together.

11:22.890 --> 11:26.602
Three pieces to mold for the bottom,
three pieces to mold for the top.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.688
And it's so time-consuming.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.899
I'm a chef instructor.

11:31.982 --> 11:35.736
So, the pressure from being the instructor
to the student is really just a lot

11:35.820 --> 11:38.948
And it… It kind of opens my eyes
to what they go through.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.535
Obviously, that'll make me
a better instructor when I'm done here

11:42.618 --> 11:44.412
as well as a better student.

11:44.995 --> 11:47.373
Amanda is challenging herself
on something big.

11:47.456 --> 11:51.293
I'm fearing that she might not be able
to accomplish everything she planned

11:51.377 --> 11:53.462
because it's a lot
of different type of mold.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.339
It's getting a little close.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.265
Why is this not sticking?

12:05.349 --> 12:06.183
Pause.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.103
I'm making a chocolate planter box.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.229
I like nature a lot.

12:10.312 --> 12:13.399
I make art at home with,
uh, full succulents and dried moss.

12:13.482 --> 12:16.318
And so, I wanna recreate that
in an edible form.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.237
I wanna keep the flavors very earthy,

12:18.320 --> 12:20.948
and so I think
it'll go well with the aesthetic.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.743
We do have an exercise
that we have to follow to,

12:23.826 --> 12:27.455
but at the same time, I need to inject
who it is that I am as a pastry chef

12:27.538 --> 12:29.540
into my creation for the exercise.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.131
-How are you, Daniel?
-Doing well. You?

12:37.214 --> 12:39.383
-Good. Our youngest student.
-Yes.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.178
I live with my two parents
and my three younger brothers.

12:42.261 --> 12:45.389
You don't see
normal 21-year-old pastry cooks

12:45.473 --> 12:47.308
making chocolate showpieces at home.

12:47.391 --> 12:50.352
So, it can get very crazy
especially when Mom wants to cook.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.854
It's a fight for the kitchen.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.064
-Tell me what you came up with.
-A coffee bag.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.065
-A what?
-A coffee bag.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.611
I'm gonna heat up the plastic
so that crumples.

12:58.694 --> 13:01.572
So, it becomes that bag look
that you see in a coffee bag.

13:03.282 --> 13:06.035
It's difficult to achieve organic form,
so very fun.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.244
-Good choice.
-Thank you.

13:11.582 --> 13:12.666
Airbrush time.

13:16.253 --> 13:19.006
-I didn't do this the smart way.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.008
Well, that was stupid.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.677
The way that I did it,
I didn't set a bottom.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.096
So, it all came out and poured over.

13:26.597 --> 13:29.642
Tyricia, I don't want to put you
under pressure. I know how you must feel.

13:29.725 --> 13:30.893
Uh, can I help you?

13:30.976 --> 13:34.480
I'm just… I don't know because I'd thought
this was a good idea to hold it

13:34.563 --> 13:37.399
because, I mean, my other alternative was
to plastic wrap it so--

13:37.483 --> 13:40.444
What you could do, put some tape
and make sure it's tight.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.403
-Okay.
-Okay?

13:41.487 --> 13:45.991
But you… you… you must seal it first
before going ahead and filling it.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.868
-Okay. Thank you.
-And take your time, huh?

13:48.577 --> 13:51.163
I tempered
the dulce chocolate first

13:51.247 --> 13:53.415
and then I'll come back
with some dark chocolate

13:53.499 --> 13:56.585
and do another coat.
And hopefully I'll be able to fill it up.

13:58.587 --> 14:01.257
You guys-- Oh.
You guys just don't want to listen.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.050
You… you… you're going to do it.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.845
I am. I got the best teacher in the world.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.221
-What are you talking about?

14:07.304 --> 14:10.683
But this is only day one.
So, I'm not a reflection of you.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.309
Thiago, still on track?

14:12.810 --> 14:14.478
Uh, no.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.730
-No? Okay, very well.

14:16.814 --> 14:19.400
I decided to make a box of crayons.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.318
I was being very ambitious.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.904
I drew five crayons.
I'm now down to three crayons

14:23.988 --> 14:26.365
and by the end of this
I might be down to one crayon.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.867
I don't know what's gonna happen.

14:27.950 --> 14:32.121
I'm ambitious with some backup plans.
So, that's… that's always how I do it.

14:33.789 --> 14:36.750
Chefs, you have
an hour and ten minutes left.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.085
Thank you, Chef.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.217
Go faster, go faster.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.764
Do you have all your elements?

14:50.848 --> 14:51.849
The taste-wise?

14:52.391 --> 14:57.438
I have to bake off my almond Florentine
and then make a quick caramel.

14:57.521 --> 14:58.647
Well, a little stressed.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.399
We're getting close.

15:00.482 --> 15:03.068
-You can do a lot in 40 minutes.
-Yes. Yes, I can.

15:11.702 --> 15:14.872
Once the moment start
that you're not having this done,

15:14.955 --> 15:16.332
I am like, really scared.

15:17.374 --> 15:19.293
Ugh. Jam it.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.051
Five minutes, guys.

15:31.722 --> 15:32.556
God bless.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.266
Come on, come on, come on, Ric.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.392
You got this.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.772
Three, two, one.

15:39.855 --> 15:42.524
Chefs, your time is up, stop.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.695
Okay, guys, this is the moment,
please bring me your creations

15:46.779 --> 15:48.322
so we can have a rap session.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.793
We're going to start with Juan.

16:00.876 --> 16:01.877
Yes, Chef?

16:01.961 --> 16:04.088
First of all,
this has to be an illusion.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.173
-Did you accomplish what you wanted?
-Yes.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.424
And I agree with you.

16:07.508 --> 16:10.302
I think this has been worn out,
you know, and played with.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.346
I almost want to ask you
to give it a spin.

16:12.429 --> 16:15.099
-You should. It should work.
-Then give me a spin, sir.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.184
-Oh, God.

16:17.267 --> 16:19.812
-What did you ask for, huh?

16:19.895 --> 16:20.729
Better spin.

16:22.606 --> 16:24.650
-And it actually does work.
-Yeah.

16:24.733 --> 16:27.236
I am being charmed
by the whole design,

16:27.319 --> 16:28.612
the story, the playfulness.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.281
When I cut through it,
I don't want to be disappointed.

16:31.365 --> 16:32.866
We're about to find out.

16:39.373 --> 16:40.499
Ooh.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.292
-Nice.
-I am not disappointed.

16:43.419 --> 16:47.297
The visual inside is as much fun
as the one on the outside.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.382
Let's try this.

16:48.465 --> 16:52.469
From bottom to top,
we have a Milo reconstructed streusel.

16:52.553 --> 16:56.265
Then we have a vanilla financier,
a Milo cremeaux with a Milo caramel

16:56.348 --> 16:57.850
and a dark chocolate mousse.

17:00.602 --> 17:02.688
-Oh, it's… it's very good.
-Yes.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.691
It's balanced.
The texture complement each other.

17:05.774 --> 17:08.485
-Yeah?
-You set the bar pretty high, huh?

17:08.569 --> 17:10.279
-Thank you, Chef.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.781
Cedrick. Great illusion.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.993
And it was very clever
to bring an edible element

17:16.076 --> 17:18.704
that has such an organic look to it.

17:18.787 --> 17:23.167
Because it is nature-inspired,
I wanted the flavors to be very earthy.

17:23.250 --> 17:27.504
I love the cherry, the counterbalance,
the fattiness of the chocolate.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.298
-Super cool.
-I'll take it.

17:29.381 --> 17:30.758
-Thiago?
-Yes, Chef.

17:30.841 --> 17:34.428
So, my idea was to bring you guys
this beautiful new box of crayons,

17:34.511 --> 17:36.430
then my kids got it
before I could bring it in.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.893
They took it outside,
they scribbled around the backyard.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.978
-That's a beautiful story.

17:43.062 --> 17:47.316
Uh, illusion wise,
it does look like a used box of crayon.

17:47.399 --> 17:50.944
I see a very colorful box
with multiple colors on top.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.447
I'm expecting to see a rainbow inside.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.617
It's pretty much what you gave us. So…

17:59.703 --> 18:01.663
Overall, it's a good dessert.
Good on that.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.040
-Good job.
-Thank you.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.375
Stephanie, please.

18:06.835 --> 18:09.421
It's a little bit more abstract
than I was going for.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.049
I was trying to initially create
more of a half moon shape.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.967
Let's try it.
Maybe it's delicious.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.470
-I hope so. Let's try it.
-It better be.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.598
For me, the chocolate is way too thick.

18:19.681 --> 18:21.475
-It looks thick, yeah.
-Big time.

18:21.558 --> 18:26.021
It has, uh, espresso chocolate cake
and then a banana curd on top of that.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.524
And the very top, chocolate cookie crumb.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.069
The banana mousse has strong taste.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.070
Nice, light.

18:33.153 --> 18:35.739
Your flavor saved you.

18:35.823 --> 18:37.574
-That's what I was hoping for.
-Yeah.

18:37.658 --> 18:40.035
I can do much better next time.
It'll be much better.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.161
I'm excited to see.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.206
-Amanda.
-Dun-dun-dun.

18:45.582 --> 18:47.876
For me,
if we're talking about pure illusion,

18:47.960 --> 18:50.003
when I see it, I am not into--

18:50.087 --> 18:52.381
I am not like,
"Oh, is it really the thing?"

18:52.464 --> 18:54.299
Right. There's no illusion.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.886
Chocolate is thin,
it's a good point for you.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.680
You spent time on it and it shows.

19:00.889 --> 19:02.724
The flavor was hazelnut latte.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.602
For me, it lack a little bit
of what you announce.

19:06.228 --> 19:10.023
You're telling me hazelnut coffee
which are two flavor I love.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.526
I want to be…
I really want it to explode.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.361
Just need to beef it up more.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.156
-Mellisa.
-Yeah.

19:18.740 --> 19:22.327
So, we are not
a hundred percent in the illusion.

19:22.411 --> 19:26.290
However, I think you completely
understood what today was about.

19:26.373 --> 19:27.207
Yeah.

19:27.291 --> 19:32.129
Finding intelligent things you could use
towards creating a creative pastry.

19:32.629 --> 19:36.091
The bottle, very smart.
I wish I would have thought of it.

19:39.136 --> 19:43.807
I used the flavors of almond pungent
and blackcurrant and vanilla.

19:44.558 --> 19:45.475
It's flavorful.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.395
-Tyricia?
-Mmm.

19:48.478 --> 19:51.732
Can you tell what she was trying to
create as an illusion?

19:53.317 --> 19:54.318
No.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.613
I was too afraid
to start all over.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.364
So, I was trying
to make it work.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.826
I felt bad, because I wanted
to step in and help you so bad.

20:02.910 --> 20:03.869
I saw it in your eyes.

20:03.952 --> 20:06.079
Let's see
if the flavor save you a bit.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.164
I hope so.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.083
I am actually quite happy

20:10.167 --> 20:12.461
because so far,
I think you have the thinnest chocolate.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.505
Nice crunch. When Chef went through,
you heard that snap,

20:15.589 --> 20:16.798
which is what you want.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.301
-That was part of my issue.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.804
-Well, it turns to your advantage, right?
-Oh, my.

20:24.348 --> 20:27.392
The texture is very good
and the taste is also good.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.186
You put so much heart to it

20:29.269 --> 20:33.106
and you were maybe lacking
a little push in the back to succeed.

20:33.190 --> 20:36.610
Normally, I would destroy myself.
I'm not doing that. I'm gonna improve.

20:38.111 --> 20:41.448
Daniel, way,
way outside-of-the-box thinking.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.618
Really, really creative.
I'm excited to try it.

20:44.701 --> 20:47.955
It is a coffee mousse
with a chocolate chigon sponge.

20:48.997 --> 20:52.793
Blood orange jam as well as
a feuilletine crispy base.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.419
Uh, I like the layering

20:54.503 --> 20:56.922
and the unconventional way
you presented it in the cake,

20:57.005 --> 20:58.924
so that's fun and it's a good combination.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.133
Thank you.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.679
Guys,
it was an amazing first day.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.389
I'm very impressed.

21:05.472 --> 21:07.307
It's one thing to have great ideas.

21:07.933 --> 21:12.521
It's another one to go from the sketchbook
to the actual final piece.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.690
-Oh, yes it was.
-It was fun.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.569
I would like to acknowledge
the work of two individual

21:19.653 --> 21:21.071
that for me, sticks out.

21:23.490 --> 21:24.408
Daniel.

21:24.491 --> 21:27.369
-Oh, my gosh. Thank you.
-And Juan.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.038
-Thank you.

21:32.582 --> 21:34.209
Creativity, you just nailed it.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.963
Technique, you even brought your own spin
to what I demonstrate which I love.

21:38.046 --> 21:39.256
Thank you, Chef.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.134
Everybody, you don't know what just came.

21:42.217 --> 21:46.555
I mean, this Latino is about to,
like, break it down 'cause I'm ready.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.099
If you stay ready
you ain't gotta get ready.

21:50.726 --> 21:53.979
-Now, let's try everything.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.564
Pass it down, pass it down.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.318
There we go. Go for it.

22:00.610 --> 22:03.739
-Oh!

22:03.822 --> 22:04.740
I did well.

22:04.823 --> 22:08.452
I, like Juan, we're on the top
of the class, uh, for that exercise.

22:08.535 --> 22:11.163
I think it's no secret.
I'm the youngest one here. Uh--

22:11.246 --> 22:12.497
-You are?
-I am.

22:12.581 --> 22:15.625
-I'm sure I surprised a lot of people.

22:15.709 --> 22:18.587
Uh, whether or not there's
a target on my back, perhaps.

22:18.670 --> 22:19.796
I think he was way too nice.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.174
I gotta start preparing
for him to be tougher next time.

22:22.257 --> 22:25.635
-We'll walk away crying.
-It's the calm before the storm.

22:27.262 --> 22:30.098
-Hi, guys. How's it going?
-Hi, Chef.

22:30.182 --> 22:33.393
Tyricia, come with me for a second?
Chef would like to speak with you.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.773
I don't wanna go
to the principal's office.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.985
Excuse me, Chef. We have Tyricia.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.321
-Hey. Thank you for coming, Tyricia.
-Hello, Chef.

22:44.404 --> 22:46.490
-Please come in. Take a seat.
-Okay.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.826
How… how are you feeling after…?

22:50.327 --> 22:51.870
Um, I feel okay.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.121
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.957
-I love that you keep the spirit strong.
-Mm-hmm. Yes.

22:56.958 --> 22:59.336
Amanda, Chef Amaury would like
to see you in his office.

22:59.419 --> 23:00.420
Okay.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.215
Right this way.

23:03.298 --> 23:06.093
Oh. I'm… I'm…
I'm not breathing. Oh, my God.

23:06.676 --> 23:07.511
How are you feeling?

23:07.594 --> 23:10.931
I'm… I'm feeling a little defeated, um,

23:11.014 --> 23:14.976
a little humbled by the, uh,
exercise today, but I'm feeling good.

23:15.477 --> 23:18.271
I don't think
you're ready for the next challenge.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.317
-Yes, Chef. Okay.
-And I want to get you there.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.236
I don't want you to jump into something

23:24.319 --> 23:27.072
that you are not going to be
comfortable succeeding in.

23:27.155 --> 23:29.825
-So, tomorrow, I will have you practice.
-Okay.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.619
It's for you to be able to succeed better
next time

23:32.702 --> 23:34.579
and to join up on the next task.

23:35.455 --> 23:37.082
It was kind of heartbreaking.

23:37.707 --> 23:40.043
You have the lowest score,
what do you expect?

23:40.127 --> 23:41.503
It is what it is.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.009
-Peppermint.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.846
-Yeah, that's a good one.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.105
Uh-oh.

24:04.693 --> 24:08.530
You okay, Amanda?
Uh, it's… We all had a rough day.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.245
I don't think I brought my best game here.

24:15.328 --> 24:20.876
You know, there's so much more to me
than what I represented to Chef

24:20.959 --> 24:24.087
and to my fellow students.
There's so much more to me.

24:34.389 --> 24:35.223
Crap.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.243
-I'm a Taurus.
-I'm a Taurus too.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.662
-I get along with Taurus.
-When is your birthday?

24:57.746 --> 24:59.331
-April 24th.
-I'm May 14.

24:59.414 --> 25:01.124
Oh, my God!

25:01.208 --> 25:03.710
-That's why we get along great.

25:03.793 --> 25:06.463
-She's like, "Oh, perfect."
-It makes sense now.

25:06.546 --> 25:09.591
I just explains so much.
It's like "Oh, that's why I'm over here."

25:11.259 --> 25:12.844
-What's your sign?
-Virgo.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.638
-Oh.
-I'm--

25:14.721 --> 25:16.556
I mean, not in a bad way!

25:18.850 --> 25:20.769
Yeah, I… I can be really focused.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.521
I… I love my lists.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.898
I like to have my to-do sheet

25:24.981 --> 25:27.859
so that you can kind of control
what's happening.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.028
That… that is definitely me
as a pastry chef.

25:30.111 --> 25:32.697
-Don't know much about Vertigos.
-Virgo.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.491
-Virgo? Not vertigo.
-Yeah, Virgo.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.875
Oh, my God.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.293
Okay.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.253
Look at that.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.505
-Wow.

25:49.005 --> 25:51.591
Look at the shine on this. Wow.

25:52.133 --> 25:54.261
Oh, my God.

25:54.344 --> 25:58.473
Wow. Wow. It's so sparkly.
How do you think he made those rocks?

25:58.557 --> 26:01.393
-That whole thing is chocolate?
-It's all chocolate.

26:01.476 --> 26:02.519
This is insane.

26:03.103 --> 26:06.273
Dude, look at the details.
Look how clean it is.

26:06.356 --> 26:11.486
That attention to detail and the ability
to craft that out of chocolate,

26:11.570 --> 26:15.240
you know, it's dynamic, it's incredible,
and to be very frank, it's rare.

26:18.285 --> 26:20.745
-Looks like a real octopus.
-Yeah, it's no joke.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.164
-It looks flawless.
-It's amazing.

26:29.296 --> 26:30.422
Hey, everyone.

26:30.505 --> 26:32.299
Good morning, Chef.

26:32.382 --> 26:34.134
-Did you take a look at it?
-Oh, yeah.

26:34.217 --> 26:35.051
Uh, yes?

26:35.135 --> 26:38.263
The next task will be
all about chocolate. This is art.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.181
-I agree.

26:40.265 --> 26:41.933
This is hundred-percent chocolate.

26:42.017 --> 26:45.353
No trick, no wire, no wood, no foam.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.689
Imagine someone commissioned you

26:47.772 --> 26:51.067
to make a showpiece for
a celebration party or birthday, whatever.

26:51.151 --> 26:52.777
It's my responsibility.

26:52.861 --> 26:56.197
If I bring you a chocolate showpiece,
you eat it all from top to bottom.

26:56.281 --> 26:59.993
This octopus and this lighthouse,
just a showpiece, told a story.

27:00.076 --> 27:02.287
And that's what a showpiece should do.

27:02.370 --> 27:05.081
That's what art should do.
Because chocolate is art

27:05.165 --> 27:09.669
and he got me really scared because
I'm like, "Okay, if you just did that,

27:09.753 --> 27:13.298
what am I gonna have to do
for this exercise?"

27:14.007 --> 27:17.052
I'm going to demonstrate
the structural part of it.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.011
The cylinder.

27:18.094 --> 27:20.805
There is few things
that are important to understand

27:20.889 --> 27:22.557
in order to nail the technique.

27:22.641 --> 27:28.271
We're going to build a frame with the bar.
Pour the chocolate in our frame.

27:29.939 --> 27:31.399
You want to move quickly.

27:31.483 --> 27:34.152
Otherwise the chocolate
is going to start setting.

27:34.778 --> 27:40.283
And in one motion,
you're going to pull once and twice.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.413
We're gonna have a 45-second window
to bend the chocolate.

27:45.497 --> 27:50.210
You see the chocolate
goes from a shiny stage to a matte stage?

27:50.293 --> 27:53.046
It's getting set, yet it's still soft.

27:53.129 --> 27:57.384
This is right now, the perfect stage
because you won't leak, you know,

27:57.467 --> 28:00.470
I can bend it. So, what I'm gonna do, is…

28:00.553 --> 28:01.680
Applying my roll.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.723
Adjust the dimension.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.517
Cut the extra chocolate.

28:06.017 --> 28:07.644
You must go fast.

28:08.228 --> 28:12.774
Forty-five seconds to be able to wrap it.
You wait longer, the chocolate will crack.

28:12.857 --> 28:14.984
You go too soon, the chocolate will drip.

28:15.610 --> 28:17.487
You need to nail that perfect window.

28:17.570 --> 28:18.822
It's still warm.

28:18.905 --> 28:22.826
When you apply cold to it,
the chocolate, they bond strongly.

28:22.909 --> 28:24.744
There is science behind it.

28:24.828 --> 28:26.663
-Do you have any question?
-No, Chef.

28:26.746 --> 28:28.623
-No? It's all clear?
-Yep.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.543
-Good. I'm a good teacher. That's good.

28:32.127 --> 28:35.463
The chocolate is now set.
We can just slide it off.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.589
Unwrap.

28:37.090 --> 28:39.342
And you have the perfect cylinder.

28:39.426 --> 28:42.762
With the cylinder technique,
you have the strongest bond ever.

28:42.846 --> 28:44.973
And you can go crazy and you can go high.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.600
My goal is to give you all those keys

28:47.684 --> 28:50.770
so that you can achieve any design
you can think of.

28:52.021 --> 28:54.858
Okay? I'm gonna give you
your assignment of the day.

28:54.941 --> 28:57.694
It must be an architectural creation.

28:57.777 --> 29:00.864
You have to incorporate
the bent chocolate piece technique.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.782
Whether it is visible or not.

29:02.866 --> 29:06.161
The two top dogs from the pastry round,
will be team leaders.

29:06.911 --> 29:07.746
Twist.

29:08.830 --> 29:09.998
This is you guys.

29:10.081 --> 29:13.251
Daniel and Juan,
I want you to pick wisely.

29:13.334 --> 29:16.504
Tyricia and Amanda
won't be picked this time.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.214
Juan, you're gonna go first.

29:18.298 --> 29:19.215
Thiago.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.760
Thiago, first pick.
It's always cool in the school, right?

29:21.843 --> 29:23.470
-To be picked first?
South America, yeah.

29:23.553 --> 29:26.765
Oh, okay, okay, I see it.
Daniel, who will you pick?

29:27.432 --> 29:30.268
-I'll go with Stephanie.
-Stephanie for team Daniel.

29:30.935 --> 29:33.188
I was a little bit flattered
that he wanted me on his team.

29:33.271 --> 29:36.191
I… I kind of, like,
was just glad I didn't get picked last.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.901
Honestly.

29:37.984 --> 29:40.361
-Second pick. For Juan.
-Uh…

29:40.987 --> 29:43.156
-I will pick Cedrick.
-Why is that?

29:43.239 --> 29:46.951
Uh, I like the eye that Cedrick has
in terms of technique and style.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.412
And being the tallest,
you can go higher on your piece, right?

29:49.496 --> 29:51.080
-Wise choice.

29:51.164 --> 29:53.333
-Daniel?
-And of course, Mellisa.

29:54.334 --> 29:56.336
I'm surprised I was picked last.

29:56.419 --> 29:59.130
I… I was,
but then also I had just delivered

29:59.214 --> 30:01.049
that horrendous-looking flashlight.

30:01.132 --> 30:04.969
So, I would have picked me last too,
honestly.

30:05.929 --> 30:08.848
You will be judged on creativity,

30:08.932 --> 30:12.769
technical execution,
and also a little bit of risk taking.

30:13.436 --> 30:14.687
And you have 14 hours.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.648
-Really?
-Fourteen hours.

30:16.731 --> 30:17.899
-Fair, right?
-Yes.

30:17.982 --> 30:21.486
Three of you times 14 hours is much more
than I had for my own piece.

30:21.569 --> 30:23.363
So, I'm expecting even more than this.

30:23.446 --> 30:24.447
Oh, dear Lord.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.407
-No, I'm kidding.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.827
-Ready? Go.
-All right.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.332
-Do you have any thoughts?
-What're your thoughts?

30:34.415 --> 30:35.708
I was stumped a little bit.

30:35.792 --> 30:40.213
My mind went playful like, a carousel.
We can model horses and have like a--

30:40.296 --> 30:42.048
-Mmm.
-No?

30:42.131 --> 30:44.801
-I'm… Okay, I'm gonna be really honest.
-No, please.

30:44.884 --> 30:46.511
-I'm not wild about it.
-Okay.

30:46.594 --> 30:48.888
I'm actually not wild about all of it.

30:48.972 --> 30:51.057
Okay, what… What is your thoughts though?

30:52.767 --> 30:54.894
I think it needs to be more like…

30:56.020 --> 30:57.605
Like, maybe a windmill.

30:58.231 --> 31:01.985
I mean, there's a lot of different types
of chocolate elements that we want.

31:02.068 --> 31:03.611
I like that. I'm fine with that.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.989
Windmills would look pretty
out of chocolate.

31:06.072 --> 31:08.616
I love that he chose a lighthouse. Why?

31:08.700 --> 31:12.203
Because there's a block
of not much work you have to do.

31:12.287 --> 31:14.372
True. What do you guys have in mind?

31:14.455 --> 31:17.250
Completely outside the box,
let's do a bridge that's, like, broken.

31:17.333 --> 31:18.501
Think end of the world.

31:18.585 --> 31:22.463
Think when you see end-of-world movies
and you have part of the bridge up

31:22.547 --> 31:25.758
and metal pieces sticking out of it,
you know what I mean?

31:25.842 --> 31:29.345
We could put some land elements
and then you can put sea elements.

31:29.429 --> 31:31.931
The good thing
about this is that this is ruins,

31:32.015 --> 31:35.393
so it doesn't have to be super perfect.
You know?

31:35.476 --> 31:39.856
As a team captain, I am extremely nervous
because it's a lot of pressure.

31:39.939 --> 31:42.692
You need to make sure
that they're working in time.

31:42.775 --> 31:43.943
They're working happy.

31:44.027 --> 31:46.946
Because if they're not happy,
it's gonna show on the showpiece,

31:47.030 --> 31:49.908
If the showpiece is not good,
it's gonna reflect on me.

31:49.991 --> 31:53.077
I want to make sure
that everybody see what I can do.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.663
-I don't know where anything is.

31:57.707 --> 32:00.043
-You all right?
-Yes, just failed.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.796
-We know what we're doing? Here, arches.
-Yup.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.256
Center cylinder, bottom base.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.841
-All right, let's go.
-Yep.

32:07.508 --> 32:08.760
Coming into the school,

32:08.843 --> 32:11.512
being surrounded by professionals,
as a 21-year-old,

32:11.596 --> 32:15.350
as the newbie, as the young 'un,
many people are very hesitant.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.268
Does he really know what he's doing?

32:17.352 --> 32:20.521
Yes, I'm here
because of the eye that I have,

32:20.605 --> 32:23.358
because I'm not a normal 21-year-old.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.860
Are we thinking
I'm gonna cut these archways

32:25.944 --> 32:27.320
before we roll it?

32:27.403 --> 32:29.572
Which one do you think?
Like, or… Would you…

32:29.656 --> 32:32.200
'Cause we can
and we can do it afterwards as well.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.788
-Gonna be faster if we do it after.
-That's fine, then.

32:37.288 --> 32:40.833
I think Daniel is very young,
like he keeps reminding everybody,

32:40.917 --> 32:45.296
and I think that that can come out
to play in his management style,

32:45.380 --> 32:49.050
because he hasn't had as many years
to cultivate his management style

32:49.133 --> 32:50.802
as, well, as I have.

32:51.386 --> 32:54.722
I have been for over a decade
used to being the boss.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.684
My husband says
that I think that I'm always right.

32:57.767 --> 33:00.812
And I think that in some ways as a chef,
that's a good thing

33:00.895 --> 33:03.356
and in some ways it's something
I need to work on.

33:06.484 --> 33:09.195
-Just watch out for over here.
-Don't push down.

33:09.278 --> 33:12.073
It's just a glide.
Almost like you put lipstick on.

33:12.657 --> 33:13.741
-Okay. I think that's…
-Yeah.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.201
-Mind if I go in there?
-Yeah, go.

33:15.284 --> 33:17.870
I don't have so much experience
doing massive showpieces,

33:17.954 --> 33:21.165
but if you don't take chances,
then you don't get rewarded.

33:21.249 --> 33:24.794
So, I'm gonna have some faith
in myself and surprise myself.

33:24.877 --> 33:27.171
Let myself surprise me.

33:27.672 --> 33:30.425
That's what I was gonna do,
but then you guys are making me nervous.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.552
Don't. Breathe. We're all good here.

33:32.635 --> 33:33.553
Okay.

33:36.431 --> 33:38.766
-Thiago, how we doing?
-Good job.

33:39.851 --> 33:44.355
-We'll have to roll our first one soon.
-I've never bent chocolate before.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.233
It was very difficult and scary,
because we have to move fast,

33:47.316 --> 33:49.444
otherwise the chocolate will set
and it'll crack

33:49.527 --> 33:51.029
and the showpiece will not be stable.

33:51.112 --> 33:51.988
Whoa.

33:53.781 --> 33:54.907
Let's go.

33:54.991 --> 33:56.367
Yeah, we gotta go fast.

33:58.077 --> 34:00.747
-Yep, yep, yep.
-Hold on. Our seam's off. Go again.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.125
There you go.

34:05.710 --> 34:09.547
Hey, you're… you're getting
a private lesson, huh? How… how lucky.

34:10.131 --> 34:14.969
So, to create a wood grain
is not composed with, uh, just one color,

34:15.053 --> 34:17.472
it's multiple layers
of different tone of wood.

34:17.972 --> 34:20.641
I am so lucky to have
the one-on-one with Chef Amaury.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.393
It's like a win-lose.

34:22.477 --> 34:24.479
You guys might get to do
a chocolate piece,

34:24.562 --> 34:26.397
but I'm getting personal time with Chef.

34:26.481 --> 34:27.356
Go faster.

34:27.440 --> 34:31.360
Showing me how he would do it.
It's, like, amazing.

34:31.444 --> 34:34.572
-Do you mind if I watch, Chef?
-No, no, no. Okay, it's made for that.

34:34.655 --> 34:35.990
-This is my private lesson.
-When--

34:37.742 --> 34:38.743
-Question.
-Yes.

34:38.826 --> 34:42.663
We plan on covering
all of this with that, correct?

34:42.747 --> 34:46.209
-Correct. That looks really nice.
-I'd like to work with my hands.

34:46.292 --> 34:50.171
I want to show some of that off, so we can
do hand craft with details like that

34:50.254 --> 34:53.216
'cause I can work pretty quickly.
So I wanted to know, like…

34:54.926 --> 34:56.052
Cover some of it for sure,

34:56.135 --> 34:58.721
but keep some exposed
just for texture and detail? Okay, cool.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.141
-Oh, it looks beautiful.
-Good.

35:05.019 --> 35:06.312
-You guys good?
-Mmm.

35:06.854 --> 35:08.606
I know. We all feel the same.

35:08.689 --> 35:10.691
Not everybody has
showpiece experience

35:10.775 --> 35:11.943
so it makes it difficult.

35:12.026 --> 35:12.902
I know.

35:12.985 --> 35:14.320
Feel bad for Stephanie.

35:15.738 --> 35:18.908
She's, really great though,
she's just letting us boss her around.

35:18.991 --> 35:20.952
Yeah.
Well, I mean, they're here to learn.

35:21.035 --> 35:23.329
-Yeah. We are too.
-We're all here to learn, right?

35:27.041 --> 35:28.209
What are you doing?

35:28.292 --> 35:30.962
This is our concrete
to go on the edge on the side.

35:31.045 --> 35:31.963
Great color.

35:32.046 --> 35:34.799
Yeah, no, I was really happy with it.
Actually looks just like cement

35:34.882 --> 35:38.553
and we like the little black specks,
so we added a little more in the end.

35:38.636 --> 35:42.849
I'm a very ambitious chef, I want to do
something that you haven't seen before.

35:42.932 --> 35:47.603
I have won some awards for, you know,
Sexiest Chef Alive a couple of times.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.481
One was funny because it was
by <i>Shape Magazine </i>and I was like,

35:50.565 --> 35:52.483
"I guess round is a shape,
so that counts."

35:52.567 --> 35:53.860
But, you know.

35:53.943 --> 35:56.404
Look at this concrete.
It's screaming to tag on it.

35:56.487 --> 35:58.823
-No. What we have is beautiful.
-You're an artiste.

35:58.906 --> 36:01.701
-Tag it up.

36:04.745 --> 36:08.666
-What season is it gonna be, Cedrick?
-Could be like an early spring.

36:08.749 --> 36:12.628
-Because it'll have moss and whatnot on.
-Yup. Nature overtaking?

36:12.712 --> 36:14.255
-Yeah, yes.
-Nice.

36:14.338 --> 36:15.798
I like moss. I like nature.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.633
You know, it's not until recently

36:17.717 --> 36:20.344
that I… I thought
about bringing it into pastry.

36:20.428 --> 36:23.514
Like, what I've been creating here
are things that have been in my mind

36:23.598 --> 36:25.308
and I have a chance to do it.
It's a school.

36:25.391 --> 36:28.227
I have the resources
to create this vision in my head.

36:28.311 --> 36:31.022
Cedrick, I love you
but I don't wanna see no more moss.

36:31.105 --> 36:33.941
I love it, but my fingers are like <i>no mas</i>.

36:35.067 --> 36:37.528
It has to come to life.
You got a dead bridge here.

36:38.821 --> 36:42.783
Chefs, you are exactly halfway
in your time.

36:42.867 --> 36:43.910
Yes, Chef.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.591
I don't know,
it's bugging me. I have to fix it.

36:58.674 --> 37:00.593
-What's bugging you?
-This ridge here.

37:00.676 --> 37:02.386
It just needs
to be faded out a little bit.

37:02.470 --> 37:05.014
I think maybe, like,
five more minutes on it, don't you?

37:05.097 --> 37:06.432
I think it looks fine.

37:06.515 --> 37:09.352
Yeah, but don't want it to look fine.
I want it to look perfect.

37:10.478 --> 37:13.689
Okay. I need something to do.
I feel like I'm not contributing enough.

37:13.773 --> 37:16.817
-What else would you like to do?
-I can do the rails.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.236
Let's go for that, then.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.323
Two hours left to go.

37:22.406 --> 37:23.824
Come on, guys. We got this!

37:32.750 --> 37:35.378
-Ooh, watch out.

37:36.003 --> 37:36.879
-What happened?
-No…

37:36.963 --> 37:37.880
-Was it me?
-Yes.

37:37.964 --> 37:38.798
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

37:38.881 --> 37:40.466
Right now, they just broke a piece.

37:40.549 --> 37:43.886
Cool thing about choosing a design
like a beat-up design,

37:43.970 --> 37:47.390
whether it is antique
or post-apocalyptic, etc.,

37:47.473 --> 37:50.518
you can allow yourself to be less precise.

37:51.102 --> 37:51.936
I almost…

37:53.729 --> 37:55.314
destroyed the whole showpiece.

37:57.233 --> 37:58.943
Don't scare me like that.

37:59.026 --> 38:00.695
We'll have two different results.

38:00.778 --> 38:04.365
They can be a little bit more messier
because of their theme.

38:04.448 --> 38:07.034
They will have to be much more precise.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.870
Just right here. Good.

38:12.623 --> 38:14.917
-Oh.

38:23.175 --> 38:24.385
They just snapped off.

38:24.468 --> 38:27.430
The weight of the wing is too heavy
for the thickness of the bar.

38:27.930 --> 38:30.057
-It's two of them.

38:30.891 --> 38:32.768
Okay. You can fix it. No worries.

38:34.854 --> 38:38.316
I'm trying to process how to…

38:38.858 --> 38:41.736
How to fix this to make sure
that in the time we have

38:41.819 --> 38:44.530
to get it on the table,
that it's not gonna happen again.

38:46.198 --> 38:47.408
Don't overthink it.

38:47.491 --> 38:49.035
-You know why it broke, right?
-Yeah.

38:49.118 --> 38:51.495
So, you warm both side,
you put some temper chocolate,

38:51.579 --> 38:53.372
you glue it, and you keep on moving.

38:53.456 --> 38:54.749
-But I would go fast.
-Yeah.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.500
I would do it right now.

38:56.584 --> 38:58.169
-Don't try to overthink it.
-Okay.

38:58.252 --> 39:01.088
The quality of a chef
is what you're gonna do about it now.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.256
Yeah. Totally.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.093
One hour to go, okay? Time to push, guys.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.015
Okay, I'm letting go.

39:13.976 --> 39:15.686
-It's fine.

39:17.021 --> 39:18.272
I'm not a fan of this.

39:18.356 --> 39:21.859
-What do you wanna do?
-I wanna do maybe, like, pegs.

39:21.942 --> 39:23.444
To be quite honest, like pegs.

39:23.944 --> 39:26.864
Once I have the top for this,
I'll roll beaucoup and I'll roll out

39:26.947 --> 39:28.240
more of these guys and that's it.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.117
-And just it? Just like that?
-Mm-hmm.

39:30.951 --> 39:31.786
Okay.

39:31.869 --> 39:34.830
Daniel initially wasn't concerned with
what we were doing.

39:34.914 --> 39:37.458
Until he decided to flip that
and decide to like,

39:37.541 --> 39:39.377
"Stop doing this. Start doing that."

39:39.460 --> 39:41.629
Barking out orders.
So, it was like a total 180.

39:41.712 --> 39:44.048
Other side. No, no, no. That's a gap.

39:45.424 --> 39:48.219
And that, like,
you know, irked me a little bit.

39:48.302 --> 39:52.181
-Last thing are rocks in the window.
-You're still missing some railing.

39:52.848 --> 39:55.559
I don't think
there's any time to roll it out,

39:55.643 --> 39:58.020
paint it, and then attach it.
I really don't.

39:58.104 --> 39:59.313
-Okay. Got it.
-Yeah.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.525
Final touches, guys, final touches.
Five minutes to go.

40:03.401 --> 40:06.237
All right, guys, we can do this.
Come on. Let's push it.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.197
The gale force winds
from their windmill

40:08.280 --> 40:09.490
broke our bridge apart.

40:14.328 --> 40:15.955
One minute left.

40:18.541 --> 40:20.584
-Wanna say a prayer?
-Yeah. Hail Mary.

40:23.963 --> 40:25.756
Chefs. Your time is up.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.466
-Phew.
-Done.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.844
-Good job, guys. Good job.
-Good job, guys.

40:29.927 --> 40:31.387
-Good job.
-Teamwork.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.140
-Did you try to turn the wheel?
-No.

40:34.223 --> 40:36.142
That's the grand reveal for everybody.

40:36.225 --> 40:39.061
-Let's hope so. No.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.564
Good job, guys. It looks amazing.

40:44.775 --> 40:46.068
Team Daniel.

40:46.652 --> 40:48.946
-Can you please bring me your creation?
-Yes, Chef.

40:55.995 --> 40:57.955
Team Juan. Your turn.

41:02.376 --> 41:04.128
Slowly, slowly.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.672
Good job, guys.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.884
Juan, tell me about your piece.

41:09.967 --> 41:12.178
We wanted to show that,
yes, there is destruction.

41:13.053 --> 41:16.098
But beauty came back, light came back.

41:16.182 --> 41:19.810
Life came back and took over
and bring it back to life.

41:19.894 --> 41:22.396
The concrete look, nailed it.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.482
Spot on. Love it.

41:24.565 --> 41:27.109
You spent so much time
on detail and it shows.

41:27.193 --> 41:30.446
I think it's pretty realistic color
for the water, for the green.

41:30.529 --> 41:33.949
I do love all the little detail
on the dirt, on the rocks.

41:34.033 --> 41:37.953
Cedrick, making beautiful moss
and glue it together.

41:38.037 --> 41:42.291
It's quite pretty but just patching things
in a beautiful way,

41:42.374 --> 41:43.876
it's not a chocolatier work.

41:43.959 --> 41:45.920
I don't want to see it in your next work.

41:46.003 --> 41:49.048
I want to see the pastry chef
and chocolatier Cedrick.

41:49.131 --> 41:51.842
-Not the gardener Cedrick.

41:51.926 --> 41:53.344
The bridge, this is smart.

41:53.427 --> 41:56.180
I love the kinetic,
brings a little detail.

41:56.263 --> 41:58.474
I love this reinforcement here.

41:58.557 --> 42:00.059
For me, the… the…

42:00.142 --> 42:03.604
the finesse is the top
and you kept that for last

42:03.687 --> 42:05.105
almost like as a second thought.

42:05.189 --> 42:08.567
The fact that we wanted a broken bridge,
we didn't pay as much attention.

42:08.651 --> 42:10.778
Even though we wanted
to have it more cleaner.

42:10.861 --> 42:14.823
When I saw you build this,
I knew it was gonna be a difficult task.

42:14.907 --> 42:18.869
I would have built this frame
flat on the table and secure it.

42:18.953 --> 42:22.748
And then you come and you apply
and then you can break it as you want.

42:22.831 --> 42:27.002
Right now, it looks like
it's not precise enough in my opinion.

42:29.672 --> 42:32.967
I know how difficult this is,
like, for real.

42:33.050 --> 42:35.052
I think it's very good for a first one.

42:35.135 --> 42:38.472
I just want you to know that you can
really push yourself further

42:38.556 --> 42:40.224
and I want to help you achieve that.

42:42.851 --> 42:44.436
-Daniel.
-Yes, Chef.

42:45.145 --> 42:47.398
Are you happy of
the overall look of the piece?

42:47.481 --> 42:49.650
We are our harshest critics.

42:49.733 --> 42:52.444
-I will probably be your harshest critic.
-Yeah, you're right.

42:52.528 --> 42:53.946
-You will see.

42:54.029 --> 42:56.156
You went with the much simpler design.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.409
It's… it's a very nice geometric.

42:58.492 --> 43:00.869
I think you nailed it.
It's hard doing chocolate that way.

43:00.953 --> 43:02.997
All the color were chosen wisely.

43:03.080 --> 43:05.749
The blue and white wins.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.710
The black, uh, complements.

43:07.793 --> 43:08.669
This I like.

43:08.752 --> 43:11.589
This is cleaner. You know,
I actually like the brushing of it,

43:11.672 --> 43:13.591
I like the… The top texture is very fun.

43:13.674 --> 43:16.510
-Stephanie, the fence.
-The fence.

43:16.594 --> 43:18.846
-You like it?
-I wish it would've been complete.

43:18.929 --> 43:23.475
We didn't have enough of the posts,
just what we, um, ran out of time for,

43:23.559 --> 43:26.812
so that small detail stopped us from
adding the rest of the rails.

43:28.814 --> 43:29.773
Unfortunate.

43:30.691 --> 43:33.902
You… you really remind me of,
like, uh, an old windmill in Greece

43:33.986 --> 43:37.281
but when you try to do
something that exists in real life,

43:37.364 --> 43:39.783
you must stick
as closely as possible to it.

43:39.867 --> 43:42.453
The blades are upside-down on a windmill.

43:44.997 --> 43:46.373
I want to see it work.

43:47.458 --> 43:49.084
-Yeah.
-Please.

43:51.045 --> 43:52.504
Hey, you have to blow on it.

44:01.180 --> 44:02.097
There it goes.

44:02.181 --> 44:05.142
Well, re-sticking,
I think we… we have it, right?

44:06.935 --> 44:08.646
Amazing. Good work, you guys.

44:08.729 --> 44:13.025
Bringing a mechanism to a piece,
it's always a challenge. This was a risk.

44:13.108 --> 44:17.237
I like that you didn't give up.
You break it. You fix it. You overcome.

44:18.864 --> 44:21.575
You know,
it's funny how you can give one exercise

44:21.659 --> 44:25.579
and this two vision
completely different come.

44:25.663 --> 44:28.248
The bridge idea, it's very unconventional.

44:28.332 --> 44:31.210
Usually we always want to go vertical

44:31.293 --> 44:34.672
and in my opinion, it's not about
the biggest piece is the better.

44:35.839 --> 44:37.758
Honestly it's… it's a big tie.

44:38.509 --> 44:41.845
We have something more simple
and with a risk

44:42.471 --> 44:45.057
we have something much more detail,

44:45.140 --> 44:47.559
so it's really a tough call for me.

44:55.693 --> 44:57.069
We have a team winner.

44:57.986 --> 44:58.821
Team Daniel.

44:58.904 --> 45:00.614
-All right. Good job.
-Thank you.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.032
Good job, you guys.

45:02.116 --> 45:03.200
-Thank you.
-Good job.

45:03.826 --> 45:06.161
Team Juan,
you lost a little bit track

45:06.245 --> 45:08.122
of the main theme,

45:08.205 --> 45:09.540
which was architecture.

45:09.623 --> 45:13.544
They utilize the cylinder technique
and it's fine that you hid it,

45:13.627 --> 45:16.547
but it is not
an essential structure piece.

45:16.630 --> 45:20.217
Just by doing that frame,
thick, you don't need this piece.

45:20.926 --> 45:22.469
I definitely think we should've won.

45:22.553 --> 45:25.889
There was more technique
and there was a lot in our showpiece.

45:25.973 --> 45:28.851
But I can't wait to just do the next one
and then just, like, nail it.

45:29.351 --> 45:31.937
Every day, I also want to

45:32.896 --> 45:34.857
give credit to one individual,

45:35.566 --> 45:36.817
the "best in class,"

45:36.900 --> 45:40.028
and it's important
because at the end of the course,

45:40.112 --> 45:42.114
I will choose one best student.

45:42.197 --> 45:47.619
It'll be an overall evaluation of skills,
attitude, everything we discuss.

45:48.954 --> 45:51.582
This best student
is gonna receive a special award.

45:53.125 --> 45:54.334
Part of that award,

45:54.418 --> 45:57.671
will be to come teach an international
master class in my own academy.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.548
The Pastry Academy in Las Vegas.

45:59.631 --> 46:01.175
Oh, wow. Awesome.

46:02.634 --> 46:05.304
Pretty cool.
That's, of course, not everything.

46:05.387 --> 46:06.430
Jesus.

46:06.513 --> 46:08.932
In addition to that, it will be something

46:09.016 --> 46:11.727
that helps you achieve
your professional dreams.

46:12.394 --> 46:14.188
And this is $50,000.

46:18.358 --> 46:22.780
Fifty thousand is the beginning
of a restaurant, of a pastry shop.

46:22.863 --> 46:25.657
It's a little push towards your dream.

46:26.325 --> 46:28.410
It's an opportunity that I never really…

46:28.494 --> 46:31.246
As a chef, you don't make a lot of money.
You struggle.

46:36.627 --> 46:39.129
For that to happen,
it's… it's amazing.

46:40.047 --> 46:42.591
Now I'm going to name today,
best in class.

46:42.674 --> 46:47.095
One individual who shined
through both challenges as an individual,

46:47.888 --> 46:51.558
as a leader, as a follower, as a creative.

46:54.228 --> 46:56.522
My choice today for best in class…

46:59.650 --> 47:00.609
will have to be…

47:03.529 --> 47:04.363
Juan.

47:04.446 --> 47:06.532
-Awesome.

47:09.910 --> 47:12.246
From the pastry exercise,
to the chocolate exercise,

47:12.329 --> 47:14.623
I was very pleased by
your rhythm in the kitchen.

47:14.706 --> 47:18.585
You were all over the place.
Organized, but you were always moving.

47:18.669 --> 47:22.005
You were always in motion.
It was lovely seeing you work.

47:22.673 --> 47:26.677
Juan did have that leadership role
nailed down much more than I did.

47:26.760 --> 47:30.597
So, I do have a little more room
to work with, which honestly is…

47:30.681 --> 47:31.682
Is a humbling thing.

47:31.765 --> 47:34.726
Really fight every day
to be the best in class.

47:35.435 --> 47:39.147
Like, it would be so important to me
to see that within all of you.

47:39.231 --> 47:41.692
Get a good night of sleep
because tomorrow it'll be rough.

47:41.775 --> 47:43.652
-Thank you, Chef.
-See you tomorrow.

47:43.735 --> 47:44.987
Have a good night.

47:45.696 --> 47:49.449
I feel like that definitely puts a target
on me, but I'm not letting that scare me.

47:49.533 --> 47:51.660
I'm not letting that frighten me.

47:51.743 --> 47:53.495
I'm gonna just, like, play it nice,

47:54.037 --> 47:57.082
but just go on there and I just,
like, "Boom! Here I am."
