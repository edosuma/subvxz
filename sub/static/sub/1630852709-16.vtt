00:09.634 --> 00:11.594


00:11.678 --> 00:13.805


00:13.888 --> 00:15.015


00:23.815 --> 00:25.984


00:32.198 --> 00:34.325


00:34.409 --> 00:37.454


00:38.079 --> 00:40.498


00:41.416 --> 00:42.792


00:42.876 --> 00:45.170
Uh, excuse us, please.

00:46.212 --> 00:49.340
Make a hole, cheeple. Coming through!
Girl on a mission here!

00:51.301 --> 00:52.385


00:55.847 --> 00:56.806
-Agh!
-Ah!

00:57.599 --> 00:59.392


01:00.393 --> 01:01.394
Oh.

01:01.478 --> 01:04.064
I love how you tickle my tum-tum,
Mr. Unicorn.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.398
Whoooo! Oof!

01:08.234 --> 01:10.737
How did that get wrapped around me?

01:10.820 --> 01:13.156
It's not mine. Hey, Stella, wait up!

01:13.656 --> 01:16.034
Can't stop. It's Friday and it's 2 p.m.

01:18.244 --> 01:20.205
I'm not missing Slung-Fu again.

01:20.955 --> 01:22.957
Nothing's gonna stop me.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.626
<i>Attention, campers!</i>

01:24.709 --> 01:28.755
<i>Camp Splinterwood is under</i>
<i>a Category Four Mayonado warning.</i>

01:28.838 --> 01:30.840
<i>Return to your cabins immediately!</i>

01:32.467 --> 01:35.345
Sorry, kids.
No Slung-Fu. Dojo's closed.

01:35.428 --> 01:39.015
Nooooo!

01:39.098 --> 01:44.020
Is it just me or is there always some
dumb emergency at 2 p.m. on Fridays?

01:44.103 --> 01:48.066
There's nothing dumb about mayonnaise
wreaking havoc at 200 miles per hour.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.984
Now, back to your cabins, everyone.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.363
None of this makes any sense!

01:53.446 --> 01:56.616
Right? Mayonado season
isn't until January.

01:56.699 --> 02:00.286
It's not just the mayonado.
There's something every Friday.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.874
Sorry. Dojo's closed. Bubble blizzard.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.000
Uhh!

02:06.084 --> 02:07.919
Sorry, dojo's closed.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.380
Uh, bee-rush fire?

02:11.172 --> 02:14.551
That's right. Swarms of bees
that cause brush fires.

02:17.053 --> 02:20.515
Let me guess a shoe-nami? Earthworm quake?

02:20.598 --> 02:22.767
A dull-cano eruption?

02:22.851 --> 02:24.811
Someone pooped on the mat.

02:27.355 --> 02:28.565
Ew! I mean…

02:28.648 --> 02:31.568
Nooooo!

02:31.651 --> 02:34.445
Something's not right.
I'm goin' out there.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.739
No, Red! Don't do it!

02:36.823 --> 02:40.410
Somethin' fishy goin' on
and I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.

02:40.493 --> 02:43.371
He was too good for this world!

02:43.454 --> 02:45.582
Ooh! I call dibs on his unicorn hat!

02:46.166 --> 02:47.333
It's not a hat!

02:48.209 --> 02:49.460
And it's not mine!

02:51.129 --> 02:52.839
Huh?

02:53.840 --> 02:55.133
Hmm…

02:57.468 --> 02:58.303
What the…

03:01.514 --> 03:02.974
Hey, Harold.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.479
-Whatcha doin'?

03:08.563 --> 03:10.523
I'll never talk!

03:10.607 --> 03:13.818
It was all Lynette's idea!
She said she needed her "me" time!

03:13.902 --> 03:15.945
I just can't take any more questions!

03:16.029 --> 03:19.365
That's why we haven't been able
to do our activities?

03:19.449 --> 03:22.327
Agh!

03:22.410 --> 03:25.288
You don't understand. This is something
you don't wanna mess with.

03:25.371 --> 03:27.040
You know, Harold, you're right.

03:27.123 --> 03:29.792
I'm gonna go back to my cabin
and pretend this never happened.

03:29.876 --> 03:33.004
Ah, gee, that sure is swell of you.
Thanks!

03:33.087 --> 03:35.298
That was easy.

03:35.882 --> 03:39.218
Guys, there's no mayonado!
It's all Harold and Lynette--

03:39.302 --> 03:40.970
-You're alive!

03:41.054 --> 03:42.847
You're alive!

03:42.931 --> 03:44.390
We were coming to get you.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.477
We couldn't leave you to die
in a mayonado!

03:47.560 --> 03:50.271
Chuck. Chuck! There's no mayonado.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.774
It's all a hoax to get us
to stay at our cabins!

03:52.857 --> 03:55.526
Ohh… Now that you mention it,
that makes way more sense

03:55.610 --> 03:57.070
-than a freaky condiment weather event.
-Mm-hmm.

03:57.153 --> 04:00.448
Stella's gonna be so mad.
Who's gonna tell her?

04:02.533 --> 04:04.494
Lynette did what?!

04:04.577 --> 04:06.788
Thanks for telling her, Penley!

04:07.664 --> 04:12.585
Now, Stella, what did Sensei say
about focusing your aggression?

04:12.669 --> 04:15.463
I have no idea
because I've never met him…

04:15.546 --> 04:18.883
because I never got to do Slung-Fu!

04:18.967 --> 04:21.552
Don't worry. Old Redsy's got a plan.

04:21.636 --> 04:25.640
Okay, good. 'Cause I don't know
if you can tell, but I'm a little annoyed.

04:33.731 --> 04:36.276
Red! Thank goodness you're okay!

04:36.359 --> 04:38.945
How on Earth did you survive the Mayo--

04:39.028 --> 04:41.364
Oh, forget it. You caught me.

04:41.447 --> 04:44.033
This is why you had us cooped up
in our cabins?

04:44.117 --> 04:45.660
So you can watch TV?

04:45.743 --> 04:48.746
I just wanted a little "me" time.
Is that so wrong?

04:48.830 --> 04:51.207
Yes. It's, like, very wrong!

04:51.291 --> 04:52.500
Well, then go ahead.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.253
Tell everyone
there was no tropical fruit storm.

04:55.336 --> 04:58.673
No flash photography flood.
No cheese stampede!

04:58.756 --> 05:01.342
You think anyone's
going to believe you, hmm?

05:01.426 --> 05:04.512
Me? No, probably not, but…

05:07.307 --> 05:08.433
Hmph!

05:08.516 --> 05:11.686
You heard her! This is why
we've been missing activities!

05:11.769 --> 05:13.563
Because of Lynette's lies!

05:13.646 --> 05:15.398
-Not cool!

05:15.481 --> 05:17.650
But we don't have to listen anymore!

05:17.734 --> 05:20.403
Her reign of tyranny is over!

05:21.487 --> 05:24.866
No one's gonna believe
anything you say ever again.

05:24.949 --> 05:25.783
Hmph!

05:25.867 --> 05:28.494
No good will come of this.
Mark my words!

05:29.996 --> 05:33.124
Mark… my… words!

05:34.751 --> 05:36.836
Do you feel great today?

05:36.919 --> 05:38.713
'Cause I'm feeling great today.

05:38.796 --> 05:41.049
From now on, things
are gonna be awesome.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.801
No one's gonna fall for Lynette's lies
anymore.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.053
<i>Attention, campers.</i>

05:45.136 --> 05:47.638
<i>The basketbird court</i>
<i>is closed for cleaning.</i>

05:47.722 --> 05:49.599
-Ha, no way.

05:55.229 --> 05:59.400
Hey, why didn't anyone tell us
the court's closed for cleaning?

05:59.484 --> 06:01.152
Lynette just did, over the PA.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.779
Yeah, right, Red.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.990
Like anyone believes
anything that comes out of her beak.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.330
Where's Chuck and Bomb?

06:12.413 --> 06:14.791
They're usually first in line
for breakfast.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.711
<i>Rise and shine, campers!</i>

06:18.795 --> 06:21.172
<i>It's nine o'clock! Breakfast time!</i>

06:21.255 --> 06:24.383
Uhh! You expect me
to fall for that one, Lynette?

06:26.094 --> 06:29.806
Yeah, and where's Brenda?
Breakfast is supposed to start already.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.061
Who said breakfast starts at nine?
Lynette said.

06:35.144 --> 06:36.270
But Lynette lies!

06:36.354 --> 06:39.107
Maybe breakfast doesn't start at nine!

06:39.190 --> 06:40.983
Maybe it never did!

06:41.067 --> 06:43.361
Maybe I'm not even a lunch lady!

06:43.444 --> 06:47.365
Maybe my whole life is a lie
made up by Lynette!

06:47.448 --> 06:50.535
So… can we just, like, help ourselves?

06:50.618 --> 06:53.955
Do whatever you want.
Nothin' matters anymore.

06:54.038 --> 06:56.082
It's every bird for themselves.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.798
Well, that escalated quickly.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.842
You know what? Now's our chance!

07:05.925 --> 07:08.886
Let's hit the dojo so I can finally
Slung-Fu it up.

07:11.848 --> 07:12.682
What the…

07:18.271 --> 07:19.564
<i>Attention!</i>

07:19.647 --> 07:23.109
<i>The amount of campers</i>
<i>bouncing in the dojo is above capacity.</i>

07:25.736 --> 07:27.280
<i>If you don't stop, you--</i>

07:27.363 --> 07:29.782
<i>Ahh. Do what you want. I'm out!</i>

07:35.371 --> 07:36.622
I can't help but feel as though

07:36.706 --> 07:38.791
I'm somehow
partially responsible for this.

07:41.252 --> 07:44.839
I just wanna do Slung-Fuuuu!

07:44.922 --> 07:47.800
I've ruined camp
for Stella and everyone!

07:47.884 --> 07:50.470
We need everyone to believe Lynette again.

07:50.553 --> 07:54.223
Uh, why are there blocks of what I hope
is lemon-flavored ice in our cabin?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.100
It's chaos in the dining hall,

07:56.184 --> 07:59.061
and all we could get was lemon slushy
from the freezer.

07:59.145 --> 08:02.982
The whole camp is falling apart because
no one believes anything Lynette says!

08:03.065 --> 08:04.150
What are you gonna do?

08:04.233 --> 08:06.110
I'm gonna have to eat crow.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.279
Uh! I'd like to see you try.

08:08.362 --> 08:11.866
It's an expression.
Means… I'm gonna have to apologize.

08:11.949 --> 08:14.202
Aww… apology accepted!

08:14.702 --> 08:17.914
Lynette, we have to do something.
It's chaos out there!

08:17.997 --> 08:20.333
Oh, really? I hadn't noticed.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.627
Look, I'm sorry. I made a mistake,

08:22.710 --> 08:25.254
but I know how to get things back
the way they were.

08:25.338 --> 08:30.301
Actually, I'm rather enjoying the fact
that my reign of tyranny is over.

08:30.384 --> 08:34.805
It's been 100% "me" time
and it's glorious.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.141
I'll clean every slingshot in camp!

08:37.225 --> 08:39.894
Hmm. Clean and wax?

08:39.977 --> 08:41.354
Okay, fine.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.314
Mm… No!

08:44.106 --> 08:45.900
I'll give you weekly clawdicures.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.777
-This conversation is over.
-No, it isn't!

08:47.860 --> 08:49.111
I just said it was.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.030
See? I don't believe you.

08:51.113 --> 08:52.990
And no one will ever believe you again

08:53.074 --> 08:55.576
unless we convince them
that you're not a liar.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.245
Ugh. Valid point.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.330
-Fine, I'm in.
-Great!

08:59.413 --> 09:02.458
But you're still giving me
those clawdicures. Every week.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.584
Great.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.044
<i>Attention, campers!</i>

09:05.127 --> 09:07.004
<i>A lemon hail storm is approaching.</i>

09:07.088 --> 09:09.006
<i>Report to your cabins immediately.</i>

09:09.090 --> 09:11.634
Sure, a lemon hail storm.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.302
More lies from Lynette.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.682
Psh! This is probably Harold
and his fake weather machine.

09:17.765 --> 09:21.185
But Harold and his fake weather machine
are right there.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.770
Hello!

09:23.271 --> 09:25.856
<i>The eye of the storm</i>
<i>is upon us!</i>

09:28.693 --> 09:29.527
Huh!

09:33.155 --> 09:34.198
Huh!

09:34.282 --> 09:38.077
Wow! You're great at Slung-Fu!
You should do it more often!

09:38.160 --> 09:39.662
I know!

09:39.745 --> 09:40.746
Ha! Huh!

09:42.415 --> 09:45.418
Pfft! There's no storm! Stop running!

09:45.501 --> 09:47.878
It's just more of Lynette's lies!

09:47.962 --> 09:50.339
Lynette's not the liar!
Red is!

09:50.423 --> 09:52.550
<i>From now on,</i>
<i>you should listen to me</i>

09:52.633 --> 09:54.552
<i>because Red's a big, fat liar!</i>

09:54.635 --> 09:56.387
Ooh…

09:56.470 --> 09:58.097
I think she's right, everybody!

09:58.180 --> 09:59.974
You should listen to Lynette

10:00.057 --> 10:02.268
because I cannot be trusted.

10:02.351 --> 10:05.855
<i>And he's so short.</i>
<i>And what's up with those eyebrows?</i>

10:05.938 --> 10:07.732
Okay, that's a little much.

10:08.566 --> 10:12.320
<i>Please stay in your cabins</i>
<i>until the jelly fog has dissipated.</i>

10:12.403 --> 10:15.239
Ah, I guess things are kinda
back to normal around here.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.408
Except everyone thinks I'm a liar.

10:17.491 --> 10:19.619
But at least you got to do Slung-Fu!

10:19.702 --> 10:21.245
You did the right thing, Red.

10:21.329 --> 10:25.207
Well, I'm gonna go back to my cabin
and brave the "jelly fog."

10:25.291 --> 10:26.709
Don't go out there, Stella!

10:26.792 --> 10:30.254
You'll be lost in the fog
and wander the camp forever!

10:30.338 --> 10:32.048
Uh, we discussed this.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.759
Lynette's lying again
so she can have her "me" time.

10:34.842 --> 10:38.638
Then why can't I see anything?
Explain that, Mr. Meteorologist.
