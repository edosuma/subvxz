WEBVTT

00:18.375 --> 00:19.916
[chuckles softly]

00:19.958 --> 00:22.291
Ooh, give me.

00:22.333 --> 00:25.125
Whatever!
You know, you better be careful

00:25.166 --> 00:27.833
I might just leave you
for your buddy Jughead.

00:27.875 --> 00:29.291
-Original.
-[laughs]

00:29.333 --> 00:31.166
Does that mean you're Betty?

00:31.208 --> 00:33.416
You know, I'm Veronica.

00:34.875 --> 00:39.000
Well, you see Jughead,
tell him I stole his cigarette.

00:39.041 --> 00:40.125
[gasps]

00:40.166 --> 00:41.958
You better be careful Archie.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.208
I heard Jughead
doesn't like thieves.

00:44.250 --> 00:45.625
[chuckles]

01:04.750 --> 01:06.666
[fly buzzes]

01:10.916 --> 01:12.875
Seriously,
you're not going to give me one?

01:12.916 --> 01:14.416
Come on.

01:16.708 --> 01:20.625
[man 1] Psychopomps are entities
whose role is not to charge
the deceased,

01:20.666 --> 01:25.541
but to guide them to their final destination in the afterlife.

01:25.583 --> 01:30.916
[suspenseful music playing]

03:34.083 --> 03:36.750
[man 2] You know, Archie,
your grandma gave me
these binoculars

03:36.791 --> 03:39.291
-and she said they were magical.
-[Archie] Really?

03:39.333 --> 03:44.125
Yep, she said that sometimes
if you are you looking
through them

03:44.166 --> 03:47.625
that you can see
the spirits of your loved ones.

03:47.666 --> 03:50.833
-[Archie] Do you see grandma?
-[man 2] Nope,
all I can see is birds.

03:50.875 --> 03:53.708
[tranquil music playing]

03:57.583 --> 03:59.208
[distorted voice]
Who are you?

04:02.666 --> 04:05.208
Where are we?

04:05.250 --> 04:07.083
Very nice.

04:11.416 --> 04:14.708
-Where are we?
-[clears throat]

04:14.750 --> 04:16.833
[laughs]

04:16.875 --> 04:20.666
[calm music playing]

04:47.708 --> 04:50.458
[laughs]

05:06.625 --> 05:12.125
[suspenseful music playing]

05:44.500 --> 05:48.333
[man 3] Archie, I need you to
close your eyes for me.

05:48.375 --> 05:52.791
We're going to do an exercise
to put you back into those
dreams you've been having.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.458
Take a deep breath.

05:58.166 --> 05:59.750
Relax your mind.

06:01.666 --> 06:03.666
What do you see?

06:03.708 --> 06:05.541
Tell me what you dreamed.

06:07.833 --> 06:12.750
I'm standing
in a sketchy restroom.

06:17.083 --> 06:19.166
I walk into the room.

06:23.875 --> 06:28.458
I hear a electric buzzing sound
behind me.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.750
[electricity buzzing]

06:32.625 --> 06:34.333
I turn around.

06:36.041 --> 06:38.541
-[sighs]
-Keep going.

06:39.875 --> 06:41.291
I hear a woman scream.

06:41.333 --> 06:42.875
[screams]

06:42.916 --> 06:44.750
I want to help her...

06:46.000 --> 06:50.750
but it's blocking the doorway.

06:52.041 --> 06:54.000
It's blocking the doorway.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.750
[shivers]

06:58.708 --> 07:03.000
I see bugs
coming out of a TV screen.

07:04.791 --> 07:08.208
[sobs]
They're coming for me.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.791
-They're coming for me!
-[man 3] Archie.

07:11.875 --> 07:13.666
Open your eyes.

07:17.166 --> 07:19.166
Birdie.

07:19.208 --> 07:20.791
[man 3] Who's Birdie?

07:21.958 --> 07:24.291
You have amnesia,

07:24.333 --> 07:27.208
but your subconscious is trying
to help you remember.

07:28.416 --> 07:31.916
You should go back
to these places you're seeing
in your mind

07:31.958 --> 07:36.750
and maybe they'll trigger
your memory.

07:43.875 --> 07:47.541
[suspenseful music playing]

07:48.750 --> 07:53.500
[trolley clattering]

07:57.916 --> 08:01.666
I got a special
ticket just for you.

08:02.875 --> 08:05.125
[laughs]

08:15.166 --> 08:17.916
Hi, Archie.
I'm Dr. Dunn.

08:18.791 --> 08:20.916
We have to talk.

08:20.958 --> 08:24.333
That ticket you got there
that's for a free meal
and for a free trip.

08:24.375 --> 08:27.791
[car engine revs]

08:37.041 --> 08:38.791
Time to eat, Archie.

08:39.666 --> 08:41.916
We made some food for you.

08:41.957 --> 08:45.583
[clock ticking]

08:48.375 --> 08:51.458
Archie, the reason I brought
you here is to enlighten you.

08:53.583 --> 08:56.291
This meal is specially
formulated for you.

08:57.791 --> 09:04.250
You've been walking around like
a zombie since your
unfortunate event.

09:07.458 --> 09:08.916
I can help you.

09:10.541 --> 09:12.083
We can help you.

09:13.041 --> 09:15.250
All you have to do
is eat your food.

09:20.250 --> 09:22.333
Then you'll know what's what.

09:24.208 --> 09:26.291
Isn't that
what we all want to know?

09:27.166 --> 09:30.958
Where we come from?
Where we go when
the curtains go down?

09:33.875 --> 09:40.416
We're born into a question mark
and then we're just left here
with no answers to anything.

09:40.458 --> 09:43.125
We flood our youth with vanity

09:43.166 --> 09:47.500
and our old age is filled
with fear of the unknown.

09:48.833 --> 09:50.833
That's how you feel, right?

09:50.875 --> 09:52.958
You want to know what happened.

09:54.541 --> 09:56.291
Well, now you can.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.458
It's time to eat.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.750
It's time
to take that final ride.

10:06.166 --> 10:08.708
Eat your food, Archie Finch.

10:09.833 --> 10:11.333
[Archie] I can't.

10:12.958 --> 10:16.083
I'm sure I'll be hungry soon.

10:16.125 --> 10:19.541
[clock continues ticking]

10:23.666 --> 10:24.791
Okay...

10:27.833 --> 10:29.708
another meal's
always around the corner.

10:32.958 --> 10:36.625
Into the kitchen we go,
where we end up nobody knows.

10:36.666 --> 10:39.625
[Archie groaning]

10:41.791 --> 10:44.458
Do you know the muffin-man
The muffin-man?

10:44.500 --> 10:48.500
Do you know the muffin-man
Who lives on Drury Lane?

10:48.541 --> 10:53.125
[screams]

10:57.833 --> 11:01.500
-[alarm beeping]
-[gasps]]

11:05.166 --> 11:08.000
[knocking]

11:08.041 --> 11:09.541
[Mary] Be right there.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.083
Archie!

11:17.416 --> 11:18.625
Come on in.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.375
Come on in, Archie.
I'll be right there.

11:34.208 --> 11:38.166
[suspenseful music playing]

12:11.333 --> 12:16.125
[electricity buzzing]

12:23.333 --> 12:25.666
[groaning]

12:25.708 --> 12:30.041
[distorted voices]

12:37.791 --> 12:40.750
[Mary] Archie,
you don't look so good.

12:46.208 --> 12:49.000
So how's your memory?

12:49.041 --> 12:50.500
Do you remember anything new?

12:53.208 --> 12:57.125
It's like all the puzzle pieces
are out there...

12:59.000 --> 13:02.458
but I... just can't find it.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.583
It's like I'm blind...

13:08.458 --> 13:10.833
and I just can't see them.

13:10.875 --> 13:16.208
I'm here for you not just as
your assistant,
but as your friend.

13:17.750 --> 13:22.791
You were once there for me
during a hard time and I want to
be there for you also.

13:27.833 --> 13:30.333
Hey, it'll...
it'll come back to you.

13:35.875 --> 13:37.041
Here they are.

13:40.791 --> 13:42.375
All your contacts.

13:44.916 --> 13:47.083
Now I can find Ed.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.166
[sighs]

13:59.083 --> 14:01.083
Got to say...

14:01.125 --> 14:03.750
you're not the Archie
I remember very well.

14:05.708 --> 14:07.916
I don't remember you at all

14:10.500 --> 14:15.458
but I'm told
that you're key to my success.

14:16.875 --> 14:20.708
One of the keys,
definitely the skeleton key.

14:20.750 --> 14:23.875
[Kim laughs]
You got that right, Ed.
You're definitely a skeleton.

14:23.916 --> 14:27.833
I keep telling him to eat some
steak and egg, all he wants is
coffee, coffee, coffee.

14:27.875 --> 14:31.125
[Ed] If I don't have coffee and
chokes, I'm living in the land
of the dead here, Kim.

14:31.166 --> 14:33.875
[chuckles] Ain't we all?

14:40.583 --> 14:42.083
[sighs]

14:45.625 --> 14:48.083
This is the guy
that's going to find your film.

14:49.541 --> 14:51.083
[chuckles softly]

14:51.125 --> 14:52.708
It's just a stand-in.

14:55.958 --> 14:57.375
And this is his girlfriend.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.291
She wants to be
the lead actress in your film

15:03.333 --> 15:07.625
and if you let her
her boyfriend will fund
the whole movie.

15:09.625 --> 15:12.375
[Archie] He'll fund
the whole film?

15:12.416 --> 15:17.250
Yes, and I bet he'd throw a
really good wrap party like a
cowboy on his own dime.

15:19.333 --> 15:20.208
Hmm.

15:24.916 --> 15:28.833
Oh, my doctor says that
if I get back to doing things

15:28.875 --> 15:33.250
that I have been doing before,

15:33.291 --> 15:36.833
maybe I'll start to remember
something in my past.

15:38.958 --> 15:41.083
Sounds like a yes to me.

15:44.708 --> 15:46.125
Oh, yeah.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.791
Hmm, attaboy, Arch.

15:51.833 --> 15:56.083
Oh, one more
thing I forgot to mention.

15:56.125 --> 16:00.333
His girlfriend is, um...

16:03.958 --> 16:06.875
a little like out there.

16:08.208 --> 16:11.375
-How so?
-She sees things.

16:13.208 --> 16:15.041
Things?

16:15.083 --> 16:19.041
Yeah, but she's on some crazy
shit that makes you go bye-bye.

16:19.083 --> 16:22.916
[scoffs]
I could use some crazy shit.

16:22.958 --> 16:27.041
I've been experiencing
some weird things lately myself.

16:28.541 --> 16:31.666
Really? Like what?

16:33.958 --> 16:37.958
I don't know.
Maybe this amnesia thing...

16:39.916 --> 16:41.708
but... [sighs]

16:43.625 --> 16:45.083
anyway.

16:46.666 --> 16:49.958
-Let's make a movie.
-Attaboy, Arch.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.291
To our lead actress.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.500
A star is born.

17:09.708 --> 17:12.958
-[woman 1] You thirsty?
-Not today.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.708
And what have you
been busying yourself with?

17:16.750 --> 17:20.083
Well, to be completely honest...

17:21.790 --> 17:24.790
I've been losing chunks of time.

17:24.833 --> 17:30.041
You can't expect for your brain
to be in tip-top shape after
what happened to you, Archie.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.750
Yeah, I know.

17:34.791 --> 17:37.791
I don't even remember
how I got here.

17:37.833 --> 17:41.625
Maybe seeing some things from
your past will jog your memory.

17:44.416 --> 17:50.500
Actually, there was one thing
I was hoping to take a look at.

17:51.500 --> 17:55.708
Do you still have that
belt buckle dad left me?

17:55.750 --> 17:58.458
Ah, so you do
remember something.

17:59.458 --> 18:03.375
[suspenseful music playing]

18:05.500 --> 18:09.250
[man 4] Look! Look deep.

18:11.416 --> 18:13.208
Deeper.

18:14.333 --> 18:18.000
Think about what's down there.

18:18.041 --> 18:20.916
What's been there for ages.

18:21.833 --> 18:23.416
No one knows.

18:23.458 --> 18:26.791
Before the dinosaurs,
this was here.

18:28.375 --> 18:33.833
So dark, so deep,
so many things hidden,

18:35.458 --> 18:40.000
we'll never know,
we'll never ever know.

18:40.916 --> 18:42.416
Just think about it.

18:43.708 --> 18:49.041
Imagine what could be there.

18:49.083 --> 18:53.291
Search your mind.
Every little crevice.

18:53.333 --> 18:57.541
Search. Deeper.

18:57.583 --> 19:00.000
Deeper.

19:00.041 --> 19:03.333
Yes, you see it.

19:03.375 --> 19:06.166
You begin to see. Yes, yes.

19:06.208 --> 19:11.291
I can tell. [laughs]
Yes, you found it.

19:11.333 --> 19:14.541
Ah, I can tell.
I can feel it myself.

19:14.583 --> 19:17.083
Oh! Oh, yes.

19:17.125 --> 19:21.291
Wonder of wonders, it's there.
It's there.

19:21.333 --> 19:25.333
I see it in your eye,
windows to the soul.

19:25.375 --> 19:27.291
You can't hide a thing.

19:27.333 --> 19:31.541
[phone ringing]

19:31.583 --> 19:33.125
[gasps]

19:35.125 --> 19:38.625
[breathing heavily]

19:45.000 --> 19:47.375
[dance music playing]

19:47.416 --> 19:50.791
[man 5] I think I can get behind
that. I'll see you there.

19:58.250 --> 20:03.625
Like clockwork, you always seem
to bring my drink
right when I need it,

20:03.666 --> 20:06.875
fulfilling a woman's duty
to servitude.

20:06.916 --> 20:09.750
That's not very nice.

20:13.333 --> 20:16.333
[choking]

20:18.625 --> 20:20.416
[thuds]

20:32.291 --> 20:33.958
How can I help you?

20:36.375 --> 20:38.041
[Archie] What just happened?

20:39.583 --> 20:41.833
Call it performance art.

20:45.458 --> 20:49.333
I see you don't have
any clocks in this place.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.666
Do you happen to have the time?

20:55.041 --> 20:56.583
[scoffs]

20:56.625 --> 21:02.541
We don't have the time,
but we do have a phone.

21:07.791 --> 21:09.333
Use that card.

21:11.375 --> 21:13.666
Can I get you a drink, young
man?

21:15.500 --> 21:17.458
[Archie] I'll take a martini.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.416
Coming right up.

21:25.125 --> 21:29.250
[tranquil music playing]

21:47.583 --> 21:54.666
There we go. A warm belly
is nice, like a warm bed or
a warm lady for that matter.

21:54.708 --> 21:56.666
How you doing, Son?

22:01.833 --> 22:04.000
[Archie]
Do you happen to have the time?

22:05.750 --> 22:08.208
[man 6] This man wants to
know if I have the time.

22:08.250 --> 22:11.500
[laughing]

22:12.458 --> 22:15.875
Piss on time.

22:18.125 --> 22:20.166
Here at the Evil Olive...

22:22.833 --> 22:24.958
we leave time at the door.

22:26.666 --> 22:29.916
Look, I didn't
mean any disrespect.

22:31.708 --> 22:37.583
It's just I've been waiting here
for someone over an hour.

22:39.791 --> 22:44.333
I just feel like
I've been here much longer.

22:44.375 --> 22:47.166
[telephone rings]

22:54.208 --> 22:55.708
Yeah, she's here.

22:57.666 --> 22:59.583
She stopped that.

23:00.791 --> 23:04.250
Now let's see if I can get this
rogue soul to realize his
destiny.

23:04.291 --> 23:06.666
[chuckles softly]

23:11.291 --> 23:17.333
Why don't you spend your time
downstairs in our VIP room,
wait for your friend Ed there.

23:17.375 --> 23:21.166
[tense music playing]

23:26.958 --> 23:30.958
[distorted voice]

23:35.208 --> 23:39.916
[suspenseful music playing]

23:51.875 --> 23:54.500
-Archie.
-Yeah.

23:54.541 --> 24:00.250
I'm Thana. Ed sent me.
He couldn't make it.

24:00.291 --> 24:02.333
Thought you
might need the company.

24:02.375 --> 24:04.125
Oh.

24:04.166 --> 24:06.791
He insisted.

24:08.750 --> 24:12.000
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, uh, he's fine.

24:14.791 --> 24:17.083
-I'll get us some drinks.
-No need.

24:17.125 --> 24:18.958
I ordered us a few drinks.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.375
You get the next round.

24:24.666 --> 24:28.333
[low beat music playing]

24:55.666 --> 24:58.375
What's this drink called?

24:58.416 --> 25:01.333
"A Short Trip to Hell."

25:01.375 --> 25:04.458
[suspenseful music playing]

25:07.666 --> 25:11.250
Someone is as serious
as the plague up in here.

25:15.125 --> 25:17.833
It's just a rum and Coke.

25:17.875 --> 25:23.000
I take it you're the type of guy
that fancies a simple drink,
like a rum and Coke.

25:28.208 --> 25:30.958
I guess you'd be right.

25:32.291 --> 25:34.666
What's your favorite drink
of choice?

25:36.208 --> 25:41.250
Dirty whore's bath water.
Classic drink.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.916
[laughs]

25:48.291 --> 25:52.916
You want to see my head spin
around, order me
that second drink.

25:52.958 --> 25:55.250
Yes, Ma'am.

25:55.291 --> 26:00.000
[low beat music playing]

26:02.666 --> 26:05.125
Get the lady an exorcist.

26:20.166 --> 26:21.583
[groans]

26:23.500 --> 26:25.000
[coughs]

26:26.916 --> 26:28.125
[groans]

26:31.416 --> 26:33.250
Oh, I felt that one.

26:34.916 --> 26:38.833
One of my favorites.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.166
[groaning]

26:52.250 --> 26:54.333
You poisoned me.

26:54.375 --> 26:56.958
[suspenseful music playing]

27:07.416 --> 27:11.541
[laughter echoing]

27:53.958 --> 27:57.166
[car rumbling]

27:57.208 --> 28:01.916
I know. I know.
You'll be fine.

28:01.958 --> 28:04.250
We just have to get you home.

28:04.291 --> 28:07.666
I'm flying like
a thousand bats here, babe.

28:07.708 --> 28:09.500
Don't get your panties
in a bunch.

28:09.541 --> 28:10.791
[Archie] I feel sick.

28:12.958 --> 28:15.500
[Thana]
I know it was a long night.

28:16.708 --> 28:20.166
I have heard that
morning sickness is never fun.

28:28.416 --> 28:32.833
Now let's get you to bed.

28:34.458 --> 28:39.833
Please,
I need some stomach medicine.

28:40.916 --> 28:44.166
Anything. Give me something.

28:45.166 --> 28:50.916
I've got something, but it
will take you out of this world.

28:50.958 --> 28:52.833
Do you accept that?

28:52.875 --> 28:56.083
It'll take away all the pain.

28:56.125 --> 28:59.250
Yes, the pain is killing me.

28:59.291 --> 29:02.958
[low beat music playing]

29:24.500 --> 29:26.208
Eat up.

29:32.666 --> 29:35.250
It's the only way
to cure your agony.

29:53.958 --> 29:57.750
[breathing heavily]

30:09.833 --> 30:13.958
Thank you. Thank you.

30:15.458 --> 30:17.208
Thank you.

30:28.041 --> 30:30.666
I need you to finish your food,
Archie.

30:38.625 --> 30:42.083
Don't be ungrateful.
Finish your food.

30:42.125 --> 30:43.416
It's for your health.

30:45.208 --> 30:47.458
[Archie] Is that human blood?

31:01.166 --> 31:04.541
Eat your fucking food.

31:12.875 --> 31:14.791
[Archie] Ah!

31:16.375 --> 31:20.750
[Archie groaning and coughing]

31:37.875 --> 31:40.625
[retching]

32:01.291 --> 32:06.166
[panting]

32:15.500 --> 32:19.125
[tense music playing]

32:19.166 --> 32:22.916
Oh, so you're the camera.
Let me take a look in there.

32:22.958 --> 32:25.833
[electronic buzzing]

33:13.250 --> 33:20.083
[woman 2] Archie!

33:29.291 --> 33:33.250
[distorted voice]
You're coming with us.

33:39.791 --> 33:44.291
-[Ed] Look, Arch,
we need to talk.
-Where have you been?

33:44.333 --> 33:46.166
No, no, no, man.

33:47.958 --> 33:50.208
Who's that psycho bitch, Thana?

33:52.125 --> 33:57.333
Look, man, you know
this industry,
they're off their rockers.

33:57.375 --> 34:01.541
I got caught up that night.
I got a little drunk, sorry.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.708
[Archie]
She started poisoning me.

34:05.791 --> 34:08.000
Started feeding me blood.

34:10.208 --> 34:13.125
That's ten miles
from the rocker, Ed.

34:13.166 --> 34:14.625
What the fuck!

34:15.625 --> 34:17.875
Look, I don't know these people.

34:17.916 --> 34:19.583
We don't know these people.

34:19.625 --> 34:22.208
That's just how things are, man.

34:22.250 --> 34:25.166
What you need to worry about,
Archie Finch,

34:25.208 --> 34:29.625
is getting back into
the director's chair,
back in the zone.

34:29.666 --> 34:32.750
Everything else,
man, will take care of itself.

34:34.125 --> 34:35.458
Yeah.

34:37.833 --> 34:39.208
I guess.

34:41.250 --> 34:43.916
It all remains to be seen.

34:57.791 --> 35:01.125
[door opens then closes]

35:07.291 --> 35:11.583
[Archie] Hey! Any of you know
where to get a...

35:40.500 --> 35:43.125
[Retrovision] There's a lighter
in your pocket.

35:44.833 --> 35:48.333
Burn the airplane.
Hurry up.

35:48.375 --> 35:50.916
You're being watched.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.916
Once inside Hardy's house,

35:54.958 --> 35:59.458
go up the first set of stairs,
knock on the door at the top.

36:08.666 --> 36:12.708
[crows cawing]

36:14.125 --> 36:16.208
[knocks]

36:19.041 --> 36:22.916
[suspenseful music playing]

36:25.833 --> 36:29.166
Hardy walks, you follow.

36:44.083 --> 36:48.666
[somber music playing]

37:04.666 --> 37:08.833
[cackling]

37:16.000 --> 37:18.041
[ringing]

37:23.500 --> 37:25.375
[Rita] Hello.

37:25.416 --> 37:26.666
Hi.

37:28.375 --> 37:30.625
Come look at my dollhouse.

37:33.708 --> 37:38.000
He's been stuck
on the second floor
for quite some time.

37:38.041 --> 37:42.333
It's been a thousand years, if
you measure it in human years.

37:42.375 --> 37:44.625
That's a bit.

37:44.666 --> 37:49.916
Upstairs or downstairs,
he can't seem
to make up his mind.

37:54.500 --> 37:57.375
Careful, you might fall in.

37:57.416 --> 37:59.083
[snickers]

37:59.125 --> 38:01.666
Right, I wouldn't want that.

38:02.625 --> 38:05.958
Why can't he go
up to the third floor?

38:06.000 --> 38:09.875
Well, you can't
make anyone do anything.

38:12.666 --> 38:14.833
Archie.

38:14.875 --> 38:17.750
How'd you know my name?

38:17.791 --> 38:19.250
[giggles]

38:20.208 --> 38:25.583
There's this thing that he does
that I can't quite figure out,

38:25.625 --> 38:29.958
but... but maybe you can help me
figure it out.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.875
-What does he do?
-Come, come.

38:36.708 --> 38:39.125
[knocking on door]

38:39.166 --> 38:40.125
[laughs]

38:41.416 --> 38:42.583
I got to go.

38:43.833 --> 38:46.666
Yes, you do.

38:46.708 --> 38:49.250
But, hmm...

38:49.291 --> 38:56.125
is it upstairs or down?

38:56.166 --> 38:57.416
[giggles]

39:03.041 --> 39:05.333
What is he doing here?

39:05.375 --> 39:10.166
-Done. Done, look, I'm done.
-[woman 3] You lost. You lost.

39:10.208 --> 39:11.500
Come sit.

39:13.208 --> 39:14.833
Sit with Hardy.

39:22.625 --> 39:28.375
So, why does a man feel
the need to carry a little
killing machine on his person?

39:28.416 --> 39:32.125
Oh! Well, yeah,
that's right, protection.

39:32.166 --> 39:37.125
Well, allow me to provide you
with your new best friend.

39:37.166 --> 39:38.750
Open the box.

39:44.500 --> 39:46.125
[box creaks open.]

40:00.625 --> 40:06.208
Ah, I think I see what ails you.

40:06.250 --> 40:09.291
A woman can get a fella
into all sorts of trouble.

40:09.333 --> 40:15.958
For instance, a woman
scorned or a damsel in distress.

40:17.333 --> 40:21.083
You ever rescued
a damsel in distress?

40:21.125 --> 40:24.541
Anyways,
I thought I should tell you,

40:24.583 --> 40:27.291
some guy used his gun
to kill his own self.

40:27.333 --> 40:32.208
He killed himself good,
real good, over a dame.

40:32.250 --> 40:36.625
Even worse it was a gift
given to him by a dear friend,

40:36.666 --> 40:40.208
but I got it now,
it works and it's for sale.

40:40.250 --> 40:42.791
Consider that
your new King Kong,

40:42.833 --> 40:46.250
just in case you're the, uh,
damsel in distress.

40:46.291 --> 40:49.208
Now, let's get you out of here.

40:49.250 --> 40:52.750
[dramatic music playing]

41:07.041 --> 41:08.166
[man 7] Pull over.

41:17.750 --> 41:21.500
You guys have been
following me since 1983.

41:21.541 --> 41:23.208
It seems.

41:23.250 --> 41:25.083
Oh, like a couple
of time cops, huh?

41:25.125 --> 41:27.333
[laughs]
I like that.

41:28.416 --> 41:30.083
You're Archibald Finch?

41:34.000 --> 41:35.583
Yup.

41:35.625 --> 41:39.458
The director of low-budget
trash, Archibald Finch.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.458
What can I help you guys with?

41:47.083 --> 41:50.541
Ah, just some normal stuff.
Murder.

41:52.958 --> 41:55.083
Got enemies, Archie?

41:55.125 --> 41:57.166
I don't know.

41:57.208 --> 41:58.958
I have amnesia.

42:01.166 --> 42:04.541
Oh, so he might have enemies

42:04.583 --> 42:09.833
but he just don't remember, huh.

42:10.833 --> 42:15.750
This is so weird.
I mean brain injuries.

42:16.750 --> 42:18.833
Just all mysterious, you know...

42:19.916 --> 42:24.250
makes us think how much like
them goddamn bots we really are.

42:24.291 --> 42:27.166
You know I'm starting to think
we're actually in a simulation,
Detective James.

42:27.208 --> 42:30.375
Oh, oh, Pete.
Look, oh, oh, I'm glitching.

42:30.416 --> 42:34.416
Oh, oh.
I'm all Android, baby.

42:34.458 --> 42:35.875
[laughs]

42:35.916 --> 42:39.708
-Mm. Mm. Mm.
-I'm more of an Apple guy.

42:40.875 --> 42:44.291
You've bitten into
any, uh, rotten apples, Archie?

42:46.166 --> 42:48.166
Women can be rotten apples,
too, right?

42:49.375 --> 42:52.583
Both sour and sweet.

42:54.250 --> 42:58.416
Some are even occupied
by that little worm.

42:58.458 --> 43:01.833
But that's never stopped you,
has it, Archie?

43:01.875 --> 43:05.583
You know, sometimes we even bite
into that nasty little seed.

43:05.625 --> 43:07.750
And what is that seed
filled with?

43:08.666 --> 43:09.958
Cyanide.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.416
[both laugh]

43:14.291 --> 43:16.083
Man.

43:16.125 --> 43:18.625
We're just messing with you,
man.

43:18.666 --> 43:25.208
It will take a whole lot
of, uh, apple worms and cyanide
seeds to kill a human, right?

43:25.250 --> 43:27.791
But only one woman.

43:27.833 --> 43:29.125
[snickers]

43:30.666 --> 43:32.458
Here's the business, Archie.

43:34.166 --> 43:36.833
Someone tried to do
a hit on you, but...

43:38.791 --> 43:41.041
only he survived.

43:41.083 --> 43:43.708
Why would someone
want to do that to you?

43:43.750 --> 43:44.916
[Pete] Yeah.

43:46.916 --> 43:48.500
I honestly don't know.

43:48.541 --> 43:51.208
[Pete] We think you do know.

43:51.250 --> 43:56.208
We think you're using this
amnesia as an excuse to forget
something you regret doing.

43:56.250 --> 44:00.375
[James] Yeah, like banging
your financier's lady,

44:00.416 --> 44:02.666
who's also supposed to be
the star of your film.

44:02.708 --> 44:04.750
[Pete]
Whoa! The plot thickens.

44:04.791 --> 44:07.708
-Who is she?
-[Pete] You mean who was she?

44:07.750 --> 44:10.666
She's dead.
Her boyfriend did it.

44:10.708 --> 44:13.541
Boy what kind of mess
he did on her, you know.

44:13.583 --> 44:15.750
Cut her every which way.

44:15.791 --> 44:19.625
-Only the bastard demon
have the guts to do it himself.
-[clicking tongue]

44:19.666 --> 44:23.541

[Electronic buzzing]

44:26.791 --> 44:31.416
[distorted voices]

44:33.458 --> 44:38.125
[woman 4] Archie, they're after you, baby.

44:38.166 --> 44:43.083
Listen to me,
you have two paths, Archie.

44:43.125 --> 44:46.000
You have to choose
the right one.

44:46.041 --> 44:50.666
You don't want to go with them. They can't be trusted.

44:50.708 --> 44:52.666
Those weren't cops.

44:52.708 --> 44:54.750
Don't fall for their tricks.

44:56.791 --> 44:59.916
Go to the El Rancho Motel
tonight and you will
remember me.

44:59.958 --> 45:03.250
[gasps]
[distorted voice]
Tonight, you're coming with us.

45:03.291 --> 45:04.250
Fuck!

45:05.916 --> 45:07.291
[gunshot]

45:07.333 --> 45:09.958
Oh, ooh fuck!

45:10.000 --> 45:13.833
[laughing]

45:13.875 --> 45:17.000
You can't kill me, you fool.

45:17.041 --> 45:21.125
[laughing]

45:26.625 --> 45:29.916
[electronic buzzing]

45:29.958 --> 45:33.166
[Retrovision]
Wake up, Archie.

45:33.208 --> 45:37.875
We have been searching
for you for so long,

45:37.916 --> 45:40.500
but this is your chance.

45:40.541 --> 45:45.291
This is your chance
to finally be set free.

45:58.458 --> 46:00.708
Open your mind.

46:00.750 --> 46:03.625
[imitating monkey chattering]

46:03.666 --> 46:06.500
[Thana]
This is how you kill a birdie.

46:06.541 --> 46:09.333
Get her in the tub.

46:09.375 --> 46:10.416
Action.

46:10.458 --> 46:12.208
[Birdie whimpers]

46:13.833 --> 46:15.333
[snarls]

46:16.541 --> 46:19.291
Jughead wants
his cigarettes back.

46:21.375 --> 46:25.833
-You see Jughead,
tell him I stole his cigarette.
-[gasps]

46:25.875 --> 46:27.666
[Archie] Birdie.

46:30.500 --> 46:31.875
[Thana] Fuck!

46:34.958 --> 46:40.666
[Retrovision]
Watch closely, Archie.
This is how you died.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.708
I really thought the birds
understood my chirps.

46:45.750 --> 46:49.125
My dad said, "Anne
you spend all your time talking
to the damn birds,

46:49.166 --> 46:51.416
-you should have been born
with a beak."
-[chuckles softly]

46:51.458 --> 46:55.583
So he gave me the nickname
Birdie Anne and it kind of
stuck, I guess.

46:56.500 --> 46:59.333
Well, she doesn't have a beak,
but I'll tell you one thing,

47:00.250 --> 47:05.708
she's got superb acting skills
and she's ready to fly
all over Hollywood.

47:05.750 --> 47:09.375
Now, what's the
name of this flick?

47:09.416 --> 47:12.666
-The film is called Retrovision.
-Oh, wow.

47:12.708 --> 47:14.666
-[Wren] Retrovision?
-[Birdie] I like that.

47:14.708 --> 47:19.041
Weird title, but,
hey, if it's good.

47:19.083 --> 47:21.208
Well, I, for one,
think the title is very unique.

47:21.250 --> 47:22.958
We read it and I am...

47:23.000 --> 47:26.791
um, we're real excited
about the role I'll be playing.

47:26.833 --> 47:29.291
We had a problem
with the love scene though.

47:29.333 --> 47:32.541
We would like you to make it
a bit more suggestive.

47:32.583 --> 47:36.791
I'm not too comfortable seeing
my little Birdie acting in a
provocative way.

47:36.833 --> 47:39.541
[chuckles]
Wren's a jealous boyfriend.

47:40.458 --> 47:42.791
Look, I'll do whatever is
necessary to be in your film

47:42.833 --> 47:45.500
as long as it's done
in an artistic way.

47:45.541 --> 47:49.750
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Very classy.

47:49.791 --> 47:52.625
Well, I'm the one
with the cash cannon shooting
dollar bills around,

47:52.666 --> 47:55.041
so this better be
a professional shoot.

47:55.083 --> 47:58.291
I don't want to find out
I was funding a porno,

47:58.333 --> 48:00.833
but anything for my little
Birdie.

48:00.875 --> 48:04.333
If she wants to be an actress,
so be it.

48:06.416 --> 48:08.708
So, do I got the part?

48:10.583 --> 48:12.666
-You got the part.
-Yay!

48:12.708 --> 48:15.250
-To the big time.
-[chuckles softly]

48:16.541 --> 48:18.166
[clears throat]

48:18.208 --> 48:22.833
So, Mr. Archie, when you become
a big film director

48:22.875 --> 48:28.375
will you let it be known all
over Tinseltown that Wren made
you who you are?

48:30.916 --> 48:33.166
I'll shout it from the rooftops.

48:33.208 --> 48:35.083
[all chuckle]

48:35.125 --> 48:37.375
Maybe we'll make a
Wren biopic one day,

48:37.416 --> 48:39.541
about a self-made--

48:39.583 --> 48:41.000
[screams]

48:41.041 --> 48:42.958
What's wrong with her?

48:43.000 --> 48:45.958
Hey, hey, hey. Shh, shh.
No, no, no, no.
It's okay. It's okay.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.916
There's nothing to be scared of.
There's nothing there, okay.

48:48.958 --> 48:51.833
Hush little Birdie,
don't say a word.

48:51.875 --> 48:56.208
Poppa's going to buy you
a role in a movie.

48:57.208 --> 48:59.041
What's happening? Is...

48:59.083 --> 49:01.125
she getting into character
or...?

49:04.500 --> 49:06.125
This will kill me.

49:07.041 --> 49:10.791
Honey, no, no. Never, never.

49:12.583 --> 49:14.458
You're mine.

49:14.500 --> 49:18.083
I'll never let anyone hurt you,
not even me.

49:21.375 --> 49:25.208
Ed,
Ed will be calling you to...

49:26.958 --> 49:29.916
work out the legal stuff.

49:33.791 --> 49:35.666
[Birdie]
They say I can play the part.

49:37.500 --> 49:38.833
Who are they?

49:38.875 --> 49:41.125
[Wren]
Babe, he already knows that.

49:41.166 --> 49:44.833
I'll let you do anything
you want if it makes you happy.

49:44.875 --> 49:47.125
Of course,
you can play the part.

49:47.166 --> 49:51.416
[suspenseful music playing]

49:53.666 --> 49:54.750
[sighs]

49:56.833 --> 49:59.083
Can I tell you a story, Archie?

50:01.041 --> 50:02.375
Yeah, sure.

50:04.041 --> 50:08.500
Let's call it
the unfortunate bad fortune
of Dr. Mind Fuck.

50:09.833 --> 50:14.083
-Sounds like a knockoff.
-[laughs] Oh, you'll like him.

50:15.291 --> 50:18.916
There once was a shrink
named Dr. Mind Fuck,

50:18.958 --> 50:22.416
who was treating a certain woman
with a mental disorder.

50:22.458 --> 50:29.250
She started seeing things
that weren't there like
this bug that talks to her.

50:30.625 --> 50:33.083
So the doctor
decided to help her

50:33.125 --> 50:36.916
and she believed that he can
make this bug go away.

50:37.875 --> 50:41.500
But the bug had already
planted its roots
into her beautiful mind

50:41.541 --> 50:46.000
and the doc's experiments,
they made her much worse.

50:48.250 --> 50:52.916
Her true love knew this and he
just had to stop this evil doc.

50:53.916 --> 50:59.166
One day Dr. Fr...
I mean Dr. Mind Fuck

50:59.208 --> 51:00.625
went on a fishing trip.

51:02.208 --> 51:06.750
He had an accident and just like
that he became the fish food.

51:09.166 --> 51:11.083
Don't be like Dr. Mind Fuck.

51:12.041 --> 51:15.291
I... I would... Never.

51:17.375 --> 51:21.291
Good and keep it
professional with my Birdie.

51:21.333 --> 51:25.208
Maybe then you won't become
another cautionary tale.

51:25.250 --> 51:27.583
[suspenseful music playing]

51:44.083 --> 51:48.041
[birds chirping]

51:58.375 --> 51:59.916
There you go.

52:03.458 --> 52:05.250
I know. I know.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.958
Look, calm down, Ed.

52:15.250 --> 52:20.458
He turns out to be a reptilian
humanoid, we always have Donnie
the investor.

52:22.458 --> 52:25.166
[Wren] So, let's talk.

52:30.291 --> 52:35.750
Ed said that you want
80% ownership of my film.

52:35.791 --> 52:40.416
100, I want 100% ownership
of your film

52:40.458 --> 52:44.125
and fuck Ed,
this is all about you and me.

52:45.750 --> 52:48.125
100%!

52:48.166 --> 52:50.375
What the hell
are you talking about?

53:08.125 --> 53:09.458
So, here's the spill.

53:11.291 --> 53:14.416
I want to fund your movie
and then shelf it.

53:14.458 --> 53:16.000
[scoffs]

53:17.625 --> 53:20.041
[Archie]
You're fucking with me, right?

53:21.375 --> 53:24.416
No, no.
I know what you're thinking.

53:24.458 --> 53:26.583
Why would I
want to shelf my film?

53:26.625 --> 53:28.833
[laughs]

53:28.875 --> 53:32.250
Of course, you'd ask that,
you poor little man.

53:33.458 --> 53:37.500
-Well, here it is,
Birdie is addicting.
-[Birdie] Sighs.

53:37.541 --> 53:38.958
She's my...

53:40.166 --> 53:45.833
I don't know, crack,
but she has left me before it.

53:47.041 --> 53:48.708
Well, I can't have that, Archie.

53:49.750 --> 53:51.625
I need my control back.

53:54.708 --> 53:57.875
How would shelfing
my film help you with that?

53:59.500 --> 54:02.333
If I own the film, I own her.

54:02.375 --> 54:05.000
She doesn't have to know
the film is shelved.

54:05.041 --> 54:07.583
I'm her manager and her agent.

54:07.625 --> 54:11.458
As far as she knows
I'm just shopping around town
like a hungry shark.

54:11.500 --> 54:16.458
Plus, she needs something
to do to keep her sane, saner.

54:21.250 --> 54:23.208
But you're not going to shop it?

54:27.083 --> 54:29.166
Maybe at some point...

54:29.208 --> 54:31.041
but until then

54:31.083 --> 54:35.250
I'm just going to dangle your
script like a carrot on a stick.

54:35.291 --> 54:37.041
You're out of your fucking mind,

54:37.083 --> 54:39.041
if you think I'm going to give
up my film,

54:39.083 --> 54:42.083
so you can play your sick
twisted game with your
girlfriend.

54:43.250 --> 54:47.083
What do I look like to you?
A goddamn circus monkey?

54:48.291 --> 54:52.500
[cackling]

54:54.333 --> 54:57.333
Hold that thought,
Curious George.

55:02.583 --> 55:07.000
Big Pie give me a call if
you change your mind, okay.

55:39.291 --> 55:41.625
[clapping]

55:48.708 --> 55:50.333
Hey, yo, Tony. Hurry it up.

55:50.375 --> 55:54.583
Come on, come on, come on. Uh...

55:54.625 --> 55:57.208
Really? Really?

55:58.541 --> 56:02.291
[suspenseful music playing]

56:03.833 --> 56:05.958
[cellphone vibrates]

56:07.541 --> 56:10.958
[Wren] Big Pie, hey.
How've you been?

56:13.250 --> 56:15.416
I'm sorry
I didn't quite catch that.

56:15.458 --> 56:17.583
You sound like
you've got a cold.

56:17.625 --> 56:20.375
Your voice
seems a little hoarse.

56:22.416 --> 56:24.833
Change of heart, really?

56:24.875 --> 56:27.083
You know what?
You don't need to answer that.

56:27.125 --> 56:30.125
You're a sensible guy.
I know.

56:30.166 --> 56:32.625
Okay, we will talk
soon though, okay?

56:32.666 --> 56:34.625
Oh, and for your sore throat...

56:34.666 --> 56:37.000
-[inaudible]
-[choking]

56:38.500 --> 56:40.250
[laughs]

56:41.166 --> 56:44.500
Oh, I sure hope Big Pie gets
well real soon.

56:45.541 --> 56:48.583
So tomorrow night I'm
hosting this gentleman's party.

56:48.625 --> 56:52.333
You should come.
We are making a flick after all.

56:52.375 --> 56:56.333
It'll be at my friend's place
and it has an underground
dungeon.

56:56.375 --> 56:59.875
We'll celebrate and party like
rock stars before we burn out.

57:02.500 --> 57:07.916
Tell you what? Rip up the check
and walk away or cash it.

57:07.958 --> 57:11.166
I'll be checking my bank account
to see your decision.

57:17.000 --> 57:23.125
When's the last time you ever
got fifty thousand dollars for
being a director, let alone 50.

57:24.625 --> 57:30.000
Think about it and maybe then
I'll see you at my little
shindig tomorrow night.

57:32.416 --> 57:37.916
One more thing, when you do show
up could you bring your video
camera with you?

57:37.958 --> 57:40.458
I've got something
I want you to record for me.

57:40.500 --> 57:42.916
It'll be real special.

57:42.958 --> 57:44.625
Can you do this for me?

57:47.333 --> 57:51.250
I got this sneaking little
feeling you'll make
a special appearance.

57:52.958 --> 57:54.500
[Mary] I need to talk to you.

57:57.250 --> 57:58.458
What's going on?

58:00.083 --> 58:02.333
I can't get a hold of Ed.

58:02.375 --> 58:03.833
It's not like him.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.875
I think something's wrong.

58:06.916 --> 58:08.541
Tell me what happened?

58:09.666 --> 58:11.916
Ed, he got a call
from an investor, Donnie.

58:11.958 --> 58:15.291
He was so excited.
This was yesterday afternoon.

58:15.333 --> 58:19.666
Donnie said yes,
he wants to fund your guys'
movie, the whole bit.

58:21.125 --> 58:24.000
There's no way he
wouldn't have called you by now.

58:24.041 --> 58:25.708
[sighs]

58:25.750 --> 58:27.458
Damn it, Ed.

58:30.291 --> 58:32.500
It's Wren.

58:32.541 --> 58:35.291
I knew it.
He's a fucking maniac.

58:38.791 --> 58:40.125
Oh, dear.

58:41.083 --> 58:43.083
What'd you guys
get yourselves into?

58:43.125 --> 58:44.458
I know.

58:47.875 --> 58:50.541
Wren told me
this cautionary tale.

58:52.041 --> 58:56.875
It alluded to the fact
that if I ever crossed him,
he would kill me.

58:58.833 --> 59:00.416
What are you going to do?

59:05.291 --> 59:06.375
Look...

59:08.166 --> 59:10.958
just keep calling Ed.

59:12.500 --> 59:14.083
Call Donnie, too.

59:15.791 --> 59:17.208
Tell him...

59:20.833 --> 59:23.500
I still want to make
the Retrovisionfilm.

59:26.916 --> 59:28.791
I'm ending this deal.

59:30.916 --> 59:33.041
One more thing...

59:33.083 --> 59:37.375
look up any shrinks
that might have gone missing...

59:37.416 --> 59:40.958
that they're in...
on a fishing trip.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.250
Okay.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.291
Look, Archie.

59:46.666 --> 59:48.916
My dad, he's a big gun guy

59:48.958 --> 59:54.416
and he insists on me having
an arsenal just in case
the world ends.

59:55.916 --> 59:57.541
There's a gun in here.

01:00:00.875 --> 01:00:02.458
Just in case.

01:00:11.083 --> 01:00:15.125
♪ I was strolling in the dark

01:00:15.166 --> 01:00:20.458

[gunshot]

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:40.458
[Mary over phone] Hey, Archie.
I got some news.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:45.166
It seems that Dr. Fred Reed
recently died in a boating
accident while fishing.

01:00:48.791 --> 01:00:51.458
[Pete]
He threatened Fred to stop
treating Birdie's mental state,

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:54.750
but she kept
having hallucinations of an
insect that spoke to her.

01:00:54.791 --> 01:00:57.416
I'm only here for you to face
your fears, buddy,

01:00:57.458 --> 01:01:00.625
which happens to be death
and I get paid for it.

01:01:00.666 --> 01:01:03.541
My brother was very intrigued
by the case.

01:01:03.583 --> 01:01:06.250
He wanted to help her,
so he started treating her.

01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:10.791
How would you like,
I tell you a story to calm you
down before I fucking kill you.

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:12.708
Wren, he put a stop to all that.

01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:15.416
He kept showing up at the
grocery store, the parking lot.

01:01:15.458 --> 01:01:20.208
That's the end of the story
except for the fact that
we got some boots for you.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:22.291
We bought you boots.

01:01:22.333 --> 01:01:26.291
You're going to wear these boots
and you're going to go swimming.
Huh?

01:01:26.333 --> 01:01:28.625
He came in with a film script.

01:01:28.666 --> 01:01:32.666
It was entitled the
Dead Shrinkin bold font
right on the cover.

01:01:32.708 --> 01:01:34.458
He started reading it out loud

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.458
and it was about
a corrupt psychiatrist

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.625
that was messing with the mind
of an innocent girl.

01:01:38.666 --> 01:01:42.250
You remember, when you were
a kid and you'd go to sleep

01:01:42.291 --> 01:01:44.375
and you thought there were
monsters under the bed.

01:01:44.416 --> 01:01:47.083
Well, there were.
[laughs]

01:01:47.125 --> 01:01:50.333
The last thing he said to my
brother before he left

01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:53.916
was don't steal
the little sheep from the wolf.

01:01:53.958 --> 01:01:56.750
He'll eat you.
He'll eat you real good.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.083
Wren invited me.

01:02:07.666 --> 01:02:11.250
-[man 8] Archie.
-Yeah, that's me.

01:02:11.291 --> 01:02:17.208
Welcome to my house of pain,
pleasure and whatever the hell
else Wren uses it for.

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:19.458
Thanks for letting me in.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.416
Hold on little, doggie.

01:02:21.458 --> 01:02:23.166
I'll let you in the doggy door,

01:02:23.208 --> 01:02:25.541
but, first,
I need to know one thing.

01:02:25.583 --> 01:02:29.250
How many years has that
stick been stuck up your ass?

01:02:29.291 --> 01:02:31.291
[laughs]

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:36.250
Relax, it's a party.

01:02:37.125 --> 01:02:38.916
It's downstairs.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:50.833
[tense music playing]

01:03:41.708 --> 01:03:43.583
[man 9] Sit down.

01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:50.208
[music fades]

01:04:02.875 --> 01:04:07.708
[Wren]
Gentlemen, may I please
have everyone's attention.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.291
I'm getting into
the movie business.

01:04:12.333 --> 01:04:15.166
[laughs]

01:04:21.666 --> 01:04:28.333
Clap, clap,
clap your hands director.

01:04:28.375 --> 01:04:30.041
You are the artist.

01:04:30.083 --> 01:04:32.875
Clap for your future works.

01:04:33.791 --> 01:04:38.333
Gentlemen, may I introduce
Archie Finch,

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:44.375
director extraordinaire and his
leading lady, Birdie Anne.

01:04:44.416 --> 01:04:48.125
[applause]

01:04:48.166 --> 01:04:51.500
She will be the
Marilyn Monroe of our times.

01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:55.958
-Yes.
-[man 10] How will this help
our cause?

01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:03.708
As all of us watchers here know
Hollywood is the great beast.

01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:07.125
Its tentacles reach the
farthest corners of the Earth,

01:05:07.166 --> 01:05:13.625
infecting the minds of the
simple, blinding the minds
of the sheeple, right?

01:05:13.666 --> 01:05:17.625
With their corrupt ideology,
morals, and ethics.

01:05:17.666 --> 01:05:25.166
So, we must blow up this beast,
slay this dragon.

01:05:25.208 --> 01:05:30.833
What better way to do it
than by infiltrating
its very castle walls.

01:05:30.875 --> 01:05:33.291
Secret societies control us
like puppets,

01:05:33.333 --> 01:05:40.041
treat us like cattle and in the
end, they sell us off to the
very devil himself.

01:05:41.083 --> 01:05:44.375
But Birdie Anne
will be our way in.

01:05:44.416 --> 01:05:50.041
She will sleep in their beds,
be our eyes and ears.

01:05:50.083 --> 01:05:52.666
Marilyn slept with J.F.K.

01:05:52.708 --> 01:05:58.125
Birdie Anne will fuck
all of Hollywood to death.

01:05:58.166 --> 01:05:59.541
[Birdie]
[gasps] What?

01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:04.125
Oh, babe.
Don't look that way.

01:06:05.083 --> 01:06:07.708
I know what that look is.

01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:10.250
It's the bugs on my face,
isn't it?

01:06:10.291 --> 01:06:13.791
Don't worry, they are harmless.

01:06:16.583 --> 01:06:20.375
The bug is talking to her again
in her head.

01:06:20.416 --> 01:06:26.291
Lately, it's been telling her
that we humans are all insects.

01:06:27.208 --> 01:06:29.041
Isn't that right, babe?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.708
But we aren't insects.

01:06:33.625 --> 01:06:38.791
We're men and we
want pleasure from you.

01:06:39.791 --> 01:06:44.166
An insect couldn't get pleasure
from you, now, could it?

01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:47.500
Well, not the kind we seek.

01:06:51.666 --> 01:06:54.666
Gentlemen, have at our queen.

01:06:54.708 --> 01:06:58.958
She will feed her king
and her people.

01:07:01.041 --> 01:07:04.666
Archie,
did you bring your camera?

01:07:06.708 --> 01:07:08.291
Push record.

01:07:10.583 --> 01:07:15.125
[tense music playing]

01:07:39.791 --> 01:07:41.916
[Archie]
Get the fuck away from her.

01:07:47.166 --> 01:07:52.000
[Wren] What? Whoa! What...
what's going on?

01:07:52.041 --> 01:07:55.333
[Archie] Birdie, come on.
We have to leave now.

01:07:55.375 --> 01:07:56.958
I am free.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.666
[Archie] Where's Ed?

01:08:02.708 --> 01:08:06.541
Ed? What am I, his keeper?

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:09.833
I don't babysit
overgrown douchebags, Archie.

01:08:09.875 --> 01:08:13.500
Now let's talk about this bad,
bad thing you just did.

01:08:13.541 --> 01:08:16.207
[laughs]

01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:20.291
[suspenseful music playing]

01:08:20.332 --> 01:08:21.582
Don't you dare.

01:08:23.082 --> 01:08:25.750
Don't you even think
about taking my birdie.

01:08:27.041 --> 01:08:29.750
Put her back in her cage
where she belongs.

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:32.875
[crying]

01:08:32.916 --> 01:08:37.791
[grunts]
For the love of... Oh, my God!

01:08:37.832 --> 01:08:41.750
[melancholy music playing]

01:09:00.332 --> 01:09:03.707
[breathing heavily]

01:09:14.291 --> 01:09:18.875
[low beat music playing]

01:09:36.582 --> 01:09:38.250
Y'all have a good day.

01:09:40.291 --> 01:09:43.957
[crickets chirping]

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:52.416
[car engine revs]

01:09:59.833 --> 01:10:01.666
[waiter]
Hi, what can I get you two?

01:10:02.583 --> 01:10:04.625
Two evil olives, please.

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:06.916
[waiter] Coming right up.

01:10:31.541 --> 01:10:32.625
Ooh.

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.500
It is an evil olive, isn't it?

01:10:35.541 --> 01:10:37.875
Yeah, you're not kidding.

01:10:37.916 --> 01:10:39.583
Hardcore little dude.

01:10:41.375 --> 01:10:42.916
My best friend.

01:10:45.333 --> 01:10:50.375
She gives me sweet ignorance
for a minute, but it doesn't
last much longer than that.

01:10:51.375 --> 01:10:55.333
You could be anywhere
doing anything and just pop out
of nowhere.

01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:58.833
I have no control over my life
because of it.

01:10:58.875 --> 01:11:01.583
[rustling]

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:03.166
[somber music playing]

01:11:03.208 --> 01:11:05.375
I don't even know who I am.

01:11:06.291 --> 01:11:10.583
Completely and utterly consumed
by this thing.

01:11:12.375 --> 01:11:17.916
I hear these voices in my head
giving me directions
and I have to follow them.

01:11:17.958 --> 01:11:20.000
It's like I don't have a choice.

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:28.666
The... the bug.

01:11:37.833 --> 01:11:40.666
[distorted voice]
He's right there.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.125
Make it go away.
Please make it go away.

01:11:55.916 --> 01:11:58.625
The mysterious ace card.

01:11:58.666 --> 01:12:05.375
Some people believe
that this card represents...
death.

01:12:05.416 --> 01:12:06.666
Hmm.

01:12:08.416 --> 01:12:10.833
-In the Vietnam War...
-[coughs]

01:12:10.875 --> 01:12:15.833
...Americans would place
the ace card on enemy soldiers

01:12:15.875 --> 01:12:20.041
to have a psychological impact
when they found them.

01:12:20.083 --> 01:12:22.250
Hmm, riveting,

01:12:22.291 --> 01:12:25.833
but I must say, I think
my trophy will knock yours
out of the water.

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:28.750
-Oh, really? Do tell.
-Okay.

01:12:31.041 --> 01:12:32.458
[chuckles]

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:33.750
Easy.

01:12:36.291 --> 01:12:38.916
What?
That was my joker face.

01:12:39.875 --> 01:12:42.541
-Well, it definitely
wasn't your poker face.
-[chuckles]

01:12:42.583 --> 01:12:45.250
That shit was
downright otherworldly.

01:12:46.166 --> 01:12:48.000
See, this is why
I should be famous.

01:12:48.041 --> 01:12:49.791
No CGI needed here.

01:12:53.291 --> 01:12:54.625
[chuckles]

01:12:56.791 --> 01:12:58.166
[laughing]

01:12:59.833 --> 01:13:04.000
Anyways, the joker card
was first introduced in 1862

01:13:04.041 --> 01:13:07.375
and was actually first depicted
as a tiger.

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:11.041
Really? Does that mean you
have a tiger face, too?

01:13:12.458 --> 01:13:15.583
-I don't know if you could
be trusted with that one yet.
-Oh, come on.

01:13:16.541 --> 01:13:20.583
[sighs]
Tell you what? I'll show you
mine if you show me yours.

01:13:26.041 --> 01:13:28.333
-Okay.
-[chuckles]

01:13:28.375 --> 01:13:30.333
In a show of solidarity,

01:13:31.875 --> 01:13:33.875
we'll raise our shot glasses,

01:13:33.916 --> 01:13:39.250
take a shot and then reveal
our finest tiger faces.

01:13:39.291 --> 01:13:40.375
Okay.

01:13:48.166 --> 01:13:50.416
All right.
Ready when you are.

01:13:50.458 --> 01:13:51.541
[clink]

01:13:56.166 --> 01:13:58.291
[coughs]

01:13:58.333 --> 01:14:01.625
[distorted growling]

01:14:02.916 --> 01:14:05.833
[both laughing]

01:14:43.708 --> 01:14:46.500
[Birdie]
Has your monkey won any?

01:14:46.541 --> 01:14:48.083
[chuckles]

01:14:50.666 --> 01:14:52.750
Hey, Archie.

01:14:52.791 --> 01:14:57.125
I know it's been a week,
but I'm so shaken up
over the whole thing.

01:14:57.166 --> 01:15:02.041
I mean if you hadn't been there,
I don't know what would have
happened.

01:15:07.833 --> 01:15:09.625
I know it's what I had to do.

01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:15.375
[sighs]
Why do you have to leave?

01:15:19.666 --> 01:15:21.333
Ed's my best friend.

01:15:23.375 --> 01:15:24.708
I understand.

01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:34.541
Go to the hotel.

01:15:34.583 --> 01:15:36.625
It's probably the safest place.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.541
Are you sure
the hotel is the safest place?

01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:43.500
That place gives me the creeps.

01:15:48.708 --> 01:15:50.791
I have to do
some detective stuff.

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:56.416
-Batman shit.
-[chuckles]

01:15:56.458 --> 01:15:59.000
Well then, you need a Robin?

01:16:02.375 --> 01:16:04.791
Just promise me you'll be safe.

01:16:07.916 --> 01:16:09.458
When all this blows over...

01:16:10.958 --> 01:16:12.708
when everything's figured out...

01:16:14.458 --> 01:16:17.250
we'll go to a beach
of your choice.

01:16:17.291 --> 01:16:20.083
-I like that idea.
-Get Mai Tais.

01:16:20.125 --> 01:16:21.416
[chuckles]

01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:27.416
[traffic noises]

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:35.458
[Retrovision] I want you two
to get into her room.

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:38.458
Once you have her secured, bring in the rest of the ghouls

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:43.291
and make sure before you kill her, to bathe her in that gallon of pig blood I gave you.

01:16:43.333 --> 01:16:46.625
[Birdie gasping]

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:53.041
No, no, no, no, no please, no.

01:16:53.083 --> 01:16:55.416
[gasping]

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.333
No, no, no, no. Please, no.

01:17:05.375 --> 01:17:10.125
[dramatic music playing]

01:17:15.375 --> 01:17:17.000
[screams]

01:17:20.125 --> 01:17:23.416
No, no, no, no.

01:17:23.458 --> 01:17:27.916
[panting]

01:17:35.916 --> 01:17:38.666
[imitating monkey chattering]

01:17:39.541 --> 01:17:41.833
[thuds]

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.541
[Birdie panting]

01:18:00.583 --> 01:18:05.625
[Wren] Film it. Film it all.
She's going to be
a star after all.

01:18:05.666 --> 01:18:08.500
And as for Archie, don't worry.

01:18:08.541 --> 01:18:10.541
I sent a snake after him.

01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:15.416
Today will still be beautiful.

01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:18.708
[cackling]

01:18:21.208 --> 01:18:25.250
[low beat music playing]

01:18:31.916 --> 01:18:34.541
[Archie]
Ed, man. Where are you?

01:18:34.583 --> 01:18:38.416
[suspenseful music playing]

01:18:47.291 --> 01:18:53.083
I'm super excited
about this investor.
Let's make Retrovision.

01:18:53.125 --> 01:18:57.166
You're my guy.
Yeah, get back to me.

01:18:58.041 --> 01:18:59.875
Text me or something.

01:19:04.125 --> 01:19:08.375
[doorbell rings]

01:19:12.250 --> 01:19:15.333
-Mary, how are you sweetie?
-I'm good.

01:19:15.375 --> 01:19:18.333
I'm just coming
to check on Archie.

01:19:18.375 --> 01:19:22.708
That's what I figured
'cause ain't nobody want to
visit an aging bat like me

01:19:22.750 --> 01:19:24.750
-that's for damn sure.
-[laughs]

01:19:24.791 --> 01:19:27.541
Um, how's his
physical therapy going?

01:19:27.583 --> 01:19:31.166
Good. Real good.
He's starting to remember
little things here and there.

01:19:31.208 --> 01:19:32.708
He's in his room.

01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:34.750
[fly buzzing]

01:19:35.875 --> 01:19:40.208
[whistle blows]

01:19:41.416 --> 01:19:44.125
[Mary]
So how's your memory?

01:19:44.166 --> 01:19:46.666
Remember anything new?

01:19:46.708 --> 01:19:50.500
[dramatic music playing]

01:19:57.750 --> 01:20:00.458
Hey, it'll...
it'll come back to you.

01:20:10.125 --> 01:20:13.666
[whistle blows]

01:20:25.958 --> 01:20:28.208
Archie, you scared me.

01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:31.041
I thought you
were the living dead.

01:20:31.083 --> 01:20:33.833
You need a shower.
You're bringing in the flies.

01:20:33.875 --> 01:20:35.666
They gravitate towards...

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.291
Well, it's obvious
you ain't hearing me.

01:20:39.333 --> 01:20:41.958
Looks like I'm going to have
to spray you down with Febreze.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.833
I'm left no choice.

01:20:46.166 --> 01:20:48.666
You have dad's belt buckle?

01:20:49.791 --> 01:20:51.583
I've been saving it for you.

01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:54.166
Now, you're not
going to sell it, are you?

01:20:54.208 --> 01:20:58.208
Because if that's the case,
I'm going to just keep it here
where it's nice and safe.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.541
I'm not going to sell it.

01:21:02.583 --> 01:21:04.791
Okay, but I'm trusting you.

01:21:08.708 --> 01:21:14.541
[voices echoing]

01:21:14.583 --> 01:21:18.458
[dramatic music playing]

01:21:26.125 --> 01:21:29.125
[music stops playing]

01:21:35.625 --> 01:21:39.375
Retrovision, hey.
What's that about?

01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:44.791
Let me guess.
How we should learn
from our past mistakes.

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:47.416
Chicken crap.
Give me that.

01:21:48.416 --> 01:21:52.458
No good alligator hugging,
cow tipping, donkey ride.

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:56.708
Who do you think you are?
Horseshit.

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:01.958
Hey, Archie.

01:22:03.166 --> 01:22:05.041
Don't listen to that man.

01:22:05.083 --> 01:22:10.041
This script is going to make for
a fine movie one day.

01:22:18.125 --> 01:22:21.208
[birds chirping]

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.750
[man 11]
Hey, what you doing
with that mannequin.

01:23:34.791 --> 01:23:37.625
Hey, look, the yard sale
was over yesterday, buddy.

01:23:37.666 --> 01:23:40.375
Hey, come back here.
I want money for that.
I want money.

01:23:40.416 --> 01:23:44.208
Come back here.
Come back here.

01:23:44.250 --> 01:23:46.166
[dog barks]

01:23:47.250 --> 01:23:49.250
What else did he take?

01:23:57.916 --> 01:24:02.000
[intense music]

01:24:07.583 --> 01:24:12.208
[Archie]
Look at dreams. I can't stay.

01:24:38.666 --> 01:24:42.250
[laughing]

01:24:53.458 --> 01:24:55.583
[gunshot]

01:24:55.625 --> 01:24:59.541
[reel whirring]

01:25:17.083 --> 01:25:19.500
[Retrovision]
Open your mind.

01:25:19.541 --> 01:25:21.791
[laughing]

01:25:29.208 --> 01:25:33.541
["Fur Elise" by Beethoven
playing]

01:25:38.875 --> 01:25:43.083
[distorted voice]

01:25:46.625 --> 01:25:48.541
[gasps]

01:25:57.833 --> 01:26:00.875
[Retrovision]
Allow me to introduce myself.

01:26:00.916 --> 01:26:06.083
I am a Psychopomp
starring as Retrovision,

01:26:06.125 --> 01:26:10.458
the title and character from a
script you wrote while on Earth.

01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:16.333
Me and my cast reenacted
elements and people
from your past life

01:26:16.375 --> 01:26:21.750
in order to wake you up
from your false belief
that you were alive.

01:26:21.791 --> 01:26:26.125
This here is not a
physical plane as it seems.

01:26:26.166 --> 01:26:31.666
These are ghost sets of actual
places you had been to on Earth.

01:26:31.708 --> 01:26:36.708
One of my best actors playing
your friend Birdie Anne

01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:41.416
triggered a memory
which resulted
in you realizing the truth.

01:26:41.458 --> 01:26:48.125
This gave us the right
to guide you to your final
destination in the afterlife,

01:26:48.166 --> 01:26:53.750
but we weren't the only ones
that were trying to pull you out
of this time loop.

01:26:53.791 --> 01:26:57.416
Dark insects had assembled
their own cast,

01:26:57.458 --> 01:27:02.208
but with the intention
of taking you to the dark place.

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:06.375
But now that you know the truth
you must leave.

01:27:06.416 --> 01:27:10.291
The insects are crafty
and could still trick you.

01:27:10.333 --> 01:27:13.125
This motel door
is really a gate.

01:27:13.166 --> 01:27:15.208
You must walk through it.

01:27:15.250 --> 01:27:19.333
Do it now
before the loop closes.

01:27:28.291 --> 01:27:32.208
[scraping]

01:27:35.916 --> 01:27:39.208
Job well done.

01:27:42.041 --> 01:27:45.916
[tranquil music playing]

01:27:50.583 --> 01:27:53.708
[Archie] What do you want
our story to be now, Birdie?

01:28:11.541 --> 01:28:13.875
[music fades]

01:28:13.916 --> 01:28:18.916
[suspenseful music playing]
