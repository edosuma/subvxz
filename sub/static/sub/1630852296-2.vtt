the FBI never asked me

06:42.402 --> 06:43.707

a privacy concern with that.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.767
- Yeah, well--
- Seems like there might be.

06:59.810 --> 07:02.422
- But, well, this guy, you
know, killed 12 people, so...

07:02.465 --> 07:04.946
- So if he killed 11 people,
you wouldn't be cooperating?

07:04.989 --> 07:07.165

violate the privacy

07:07.209 --> 07:09.559

It's a slippery slope.

had requested this information.

the Ponderosa anymore.

07:57.346 --> 07:59.174
- Yeah. Before,
some niche trade journals

07:59.217 --> 08:01.263
said I had a bad car.

08:01.306 --> 08:04.614
Now CNN is accusing me
of protecting a mass murderer.

08:04.658 --> 08:05.876
- It's not even accurate.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.574
He's a serial killer,
not a mass murderer.

08:07.617 --> 08:08.575
- What's the difference?

08:08.618 --> 08:09.750
- Mass murderers

08:09.793 --> 08:11.142
kill a bunch of people
at the same time.

08:11.186 --> 08:12.579
Serial killers need
a cooling off period.

08:12.622 --> 08:14.581
- Okay, yes,
it was a bad interview

08:14.624 --> 08:17.497
which I advised you not to do,
but let's not overreact.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.411
It's not like anyone's saying
she's pro-murderer.

08:19.455 --> 08:20.674
- Actually, I've been getting

08:20.717 --> 08:22.458
a few calls asking
your position on murder.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.112
- I hope you said
that I was against it.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.592
- I said, "I don't know,
but I'll check."

08:25.635 --> 08:27.594
- I mean, look,
from a legal perspective, okay,

08:27.637 --> 08:29.944
it's not like this guy has
been convicted of anything yet.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.206
I mean, what are we
supposed to do,

08:31.249 --> 08:33.338
hand out every alleged
murderers' info?

08:33.382 --> 08:35.297
- That's true. There's
no proof he even did anything.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.168
- They found a bunch
of skins in his shed.

08:37.212 --> 08:38.430
- He was skinning people?

08:38.474 --> 08:39.562
- Before or after
he killed them?

08:39.606 --> 08:40.781
- What's the difference?

08:40.824 --> 08:42.652
- Well, before is worse.

08:42.696 --> 08:44.132
- Even if he did do it,

08:44.175 --> 08:45.960
maybe he only kills evil people
who deserve to die,

08:46.003 --> 08:47.309
like, maybe he's a Dexter
or something.

08:47.352 --> 08:48.484
- Ooh...
- You want me to check

08:48.528 --> 08:49.964
if he's a Dexter?
- Yeah, would you?

08:50.007 --> 08:52.096
- Well, I'd just be concerned
that claiming the people

08:52.140 --> 08:54.795
he killed deserved to die might
come off as victim-blaming.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.971
- Well, what would you suggest?
We just wait for it to pass?

08:57.014 --> 08:58.320
Because waiting
is not going to

08:58.363 --> 08:59.713
bring those 12 people
back from the dead.

08:59.756 --> 09:01.410
- I didn't realize
that was the goal here.

09:01.453 --> 09:02.542
- I hate to bring this up,
but are we

09:02.585 --> 09:04.195
complying with the subpoena?
- Yes!

09:04.239 --> 09:06.981
- No! I just announced
that we were fighting it.

09:07.024 --> 09:08.939
Backing down
makes me look indecisive.

09:08.983 --> 09:10.506
- Would you rather
look indecisive

09:10.550 --> 09:12.508
or be an accessory
to murder after the fact?

09:12.552 --> 09:14.249
- I don't know. It's hard.
- Is it?

09:14.292 --> 09:16.599
- Is there any way
to fight the subpoena

09:16.643 --> 09:18.601
but also hand
over the location data?

09:18.645 --> 09:21.430
- Right, so that's, I mean--
That's two separate things.

09:21.473 --> 09:23.388
- Right.
But, I mean, we've got to walk

09:23.432 --> 09:24.868
and chew gum
at the same time, right?

09:24.912 --> 09:26.522
- Yeah, I get it.
I mean, it's more like walking

09:26.566 --> 09:29.003
while also simultaneously
refusing to walk.

09:29.046 --> 09:30.526
Do you see what I mean?
- Mm-mm.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.919
- What if he killed a bunch
of people on the same day,

09:31.962 --> 09:33.442
but in different locations?

09:33.485 --> 09:35.183
Does that make him a mass
murderer or a serial killer?

09:35.226 --> 09:37.141
- That's actually
a spree killer.

09:37.185 --> 09:39.100
- Why do you know so much
about serial killers?

09:39.143 --> 09:40.710
- I read.

09:40.754 --> 09:43.844
[energetic music]

09:43.887 --> 09:45.541
- Oh, wow.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.630
You already
have a corner office?

09:47.674 --> 09:49.676
Men do have it easier.

09:49.719 --> 09:52.635
- Funny, funny. No, Wesley's
having me do some redecorating.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.550
He's kind of taking me
under his wing.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.858
- Wesley.
Yeah, he does that sometimes.

09:57.901 --> 09:59.511
- He...does what?

09:59.555 --> 10:02.471
- He'll grab a hapless new guy
and basically appropriate him.

10:02.514 --> 10:05.387
He gets an assistant,
and you get the opportunity

10:05.430 --> 10:07.345
to be taken advantage
of by an idiot.

10:07.389 --> 10:08.651
- What are you talking about?

10:08.695 --> 10:10.218
Isn't he like
big time around here?

10:10.261 --> 10:12.394
- Wesley? No.
He shares a name

10:12.437 --> 10:14.657
with the founder
of the company, but that is it.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.441
The guy doesn't even
have an office.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.661
Like, he's squatting in here
while Jin's on vacation.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.924
Didn't you wonder why
there's so many pictures

10:20.968 --> 10:22.926
of an Asian family in here?

10:22.970 --> 10:25.668
- Come on.
- Jack.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.409
- [groans]

10:27.452 --> 10:29.063
You don't have to
enjoy it so much.

10:29.106 --> 10:30.586
- I'm enjoying it a little bit.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.023
- Hey.
Whatever you guys are doing,

10:33.067 --> 10:35.069
could you not do it
in Jin's office?

10:35.112 --> 10:36.331
- No, no. Just a--
- We were just--

10:36.374 --> 10:38.638
- It's an office, not a motel.

10:40.074 --> 10:43.338
- Unfortunately, the policy
of Payne Motors is now

10:43.381 --> 10:45.688
not to hand over
GPS information.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.690
- You're fighting the subpoena?
- To be clear,

10:47.734 --> 10:50.171
the location of the vehicle
is on this computer--

10:50.214 --> 10:52.129
- But we can't show it to you.

10:52.173 --> 10:57.569
But do understand that this
doesn't reflect our beliefs.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.093
- Fine.
We'll take you to court.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.398
Could have told this
on the phone.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.096
- We feel terrible.

11:02.139 --> 11:04.751
I don't know how we can
look ourselves in the mirror.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.796
- [ahem]!

11:08.493 --> 11:11.366
- Hey, Jeremy, the suspect
is headed eastbound on I-94.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.324
- [ahem] Westbound.
- It's reversed.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.283
- Westbound.
[mouthing] Thank you.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.415
- Jack-of-all-trades.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.200
Hey, I need you to make
a doctor's appointment for me.

11:19.243 --> 11:20.723
- You know what?

11:20.767 --> 11:22.159
I would, but, like,
right now I'm just--

11:22.203 --> 11:23.987
- Don't spread that number
around--he's concierge.

11:24.031 --> 11:26.729
There's only, like, five guys
in the world with access.

11:26.773 --> 11:27.904
- Yeah.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.732
- [popping lips]

11:29.776 --> 11:30.864
[grunts] Uhh!

11:30.907 --> 11:32.866
Hi. I need to schedule
an appointment

11:32.909 --> 11:34.650
for Wesley Payne.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.869
23rd work?

11:35.912 --> 11:37.871
- Is there any way
they can see me earlier?

11:37.914 --> 11:40.830
- Yeah, do you have anything
just a little bit sooner?

11:40.874 --> 11:43.833
She wants to know
is it an emergency or--

11:43.877 --> 11:45.400
- Just have her
put the doctor on.

11:45.443 --> 11:47.619
- Okay. Can he just
speak to the doctor?

11:47.663 --> 11:49.056
- I don't want some, like,
receptionist

11:49.099 --> 11:50.187
hearing all the sordid details.

11:50.231 --> 11:52.755
- I get it. I'm--
- Go to the source.

11:52.799 --> 11:55.758
- Dr. Rossinow? Yeah, yeah.
Just a sec.

11:55.802 --> 11:59.370
- No, you're good. You're good.
Tell him for the last 2 days,

11:59.414 --> 12:03.810
whenever I masturbate,
nothing comes out.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.028
Tell him.

12:05.072 --> 12:07.335
- Yes. Yes.

12:07.378 --> 12:10.294
when Mr. Payne, um...[ahem]...

12:10.338 --> 12:12.949
when he masturbates,
nothing comes out.

12:12.993 --> 12:14.429
- Nothing.

12:14.472 --> 12:16.518
- Hey, Katherine.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.172
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

12:18.215 --> 12:19.695
- Oh, mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.436
So I know you don't
really know me yet,

12:21.479 --> 12:23.525
but I'm a professional and--

12:23.568 --> 12:25.614
- All I ask is that you
don't have sex in the office.

12:25.657 --> 12:27.572
I know some women need it
more than others, but it's--

12:27.616 --> 12:30.706
- No, that's not--
A different conversation.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.795
I mean, I get that
we don't have the same way

12:32.839 --> 12:35.972
of approaching things, but if
you could just trust me--

12:36.016 --> 12:38.714
- Oh, there's a massive
hurricane headed towards Aruba.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.412
- Are you happy about this?
- It's all over the news.

12:41.456 --> 12:42.805
No one's talking
about us anymore.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.720
- Are they okay?
- I don't know.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.809
You know what?
Maybe you were right.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.812
Maybe the better move
was just to wait it out.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.858
- Oh, yeah. Well, the best way
to stay out of the news

12:51.901 --> 12:53.207
is do not make the news.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.122
I always say
that communications

12:55.165 --> 12:56.253
isn't just about what's said.

12:56.297 --> 12:57.864
It's also what's unsaid,
you know?

12:57.907 --> 12:59.561
- What's going on?

12:59.604 --> 13:01.693
-...the Michigan Monster
in his white Payne Magellan.

13:01.737 --> 13:03.130
- Well, we're only about
20 minutes in,

13:03.173 --> 13:06.698
but if it's anything
like O.J. in '94,

13:06.742 --> 13:10.485
we're gonna be talking about
this for quite a while.

13:12.269 --> 13:12.530
.

13:12.574 --> 13:14.750
- Hour two of the police
pursuit of the white Payne--

13:14.794 --> 13:15.925
- The same Payne Magellan

13:15.969 --> 13:17.709
that he used
to abduct and skin his--

13:17.753 --> 13:20.103
- The police pursuit for
the Payne Magellan will--

13:20.147 --> 13:21.409
- Why do they have
keep referring

13:21.452 --> 13:22.802
to the make of the car?

13:22.845 --> 13:24.281
The guy literally peeled
a dozen people,

13:24.325 --> 13:26.806
but what America wants to know
is what's he driving?

13:26.849 --> 13:28.198
- I don't get how
we're responsible for this.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.721
I mean, we just
sold him the car.

13:29.765 --> 13:30.897
We can't control
what he does with it.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.812
- It's just bad press.
It looks bad.

13:32.855 --> 13:34.030
- I actually agree
with Cyrus, you know?

13:34.074 --> 13:35.597
I mean, the car
didn't kill anyone, okay?

13:35.640 --> 13:40.297
We're blameless, like gun
manufacturers after a shooting.

13:40.341 --> 13:42.386
- Okay, yeah, this looks bad.
- Yeah.

13:42.430 --> 13:44.606
- Maybe we should just
discontinue the whole line.

13:44.649 --> 13:45.868
Or make them murder-proof.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.435
- How do you
murder-proof a car?

13:47.478 --> 13:49.089
- Well, you start by telling
your chief product designer

13:49.132 --> 13:50.525
to make them murder-proof,
and then when he says

13:50.568 --> 13:52.657
he can't do it,
you hire someone who can.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.529
- Burn!
- Maybe we should have

13:54.572 --> 13:57.010
the car dealers
start doing background checks.

13:57.053 --> 13:59.055
Stop selling them
to serial killers.

13:59.099 --> 14:01.231
- Right, but no one knows
what serial killers look like.

14:01.275 --> 14:02.580
- Well, there are signs.
- Yeah. The mustache.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.060
Members Only jacket.

14:04.104 --> 14:05.627
- Sometimes they dress
up like a clown.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.063
- We are not stopping selling
cars to clowns, all right?

14:07.107 --> 14:08.456
Not all clowns
are serial killers.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.153
- Most of them are.

14:10.197 --> 14:11.720
- Of course most of them are,
but I'm saying not all of them.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.461
- I'm sorry. Can I just say
something about this?

14:13.504 --> 14:15.071
- No, no, no. Let me guess.

14:15.115 --> 14:17.900
"Let's not do anything.
Let's just sit back and pray

14:17.944 --> 14:20.903
that another hurricane
hits a tropical island."

14:20.947 --> 14:22.731
- Um...no.

14:22.774 --> 14:25.777
Actually, I was going to say we
should do a full media blitz.

14:25.821 --> 14:28.606
We should issue statements,
get the families on record

14:28.650 --> 14:30.217
saying they don't blame us
for the murders

14:30.260 --> 14:32.567
and, you know,
full-court press.

14:32.610 --> 14:36.223
- Well, all right. Finally.
Welcome to the team.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.615
- Good.

14:37.659 --> 14:40.792
Hi. Is this Brian Redcorn?

14:40.836 --> 14:44.013
Hi.
I'm calling from Payne Motors.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.928
I understand your dad
was one of the men

14:45.972 --> 14:47.625
whose skin was found
in the torture shed,

14:47.669 --> 14:52.108
and I just want to say
how sorry we are here at--

14:54.371 --> 14:59.507
Oh. Yeah. I just assumed
you had been informed.

15:00.638 --> 15:03.206
- Juh-juh-juh-jackhammer.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.469
Hey, I'm craving
some Khanom Chan.

15:05.513 --> 15:08.168
It's like this
Thai layered Jell-O.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.518
FYI, this place is in
a very sketchy neighborhood.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.607
- Is there, like,

15:12.650 --> 15:15.436
any way that somebody else
can just maybe get it for you?

15:15.479 --> 15:18.961
- What do you mean?
Like, you don't want to, or--

15:19.005 --> 15:21.137
- No, no, no!
Psss! No, no.

15:21.181 --> 15:23.487
I mean,
it's just that Elliott's

15:23.531 --> 15:25.446
having me do
some stuff for him.

15:25.489 --> 15:27.839
Yeah. On a deadline
with these here contracts.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.145
- Oh.
- Yeah.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.408
You know, otherwise,
I would love to.

15:31.452 --> 15:32.975
- Oh, yeah.
- I would love to, but--

15:33.019 --> 15:34.063
- No, I totally get it. No, no.
You're busy.

15:34.107 --> 15:35.325
It's totally cool.
Yeah. We're good.

15:35.369 --> 15:36.979
- Yeah.
- We're good. Yeah. Awesome.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.981
- You're sure? I mean--
- Cool.

15:43.551 --> 15:46.162
- Hey, Brit-Dick.

15:46.206 --> 15:48.164
Don't ever give Jack
another assignment,

15:48.208 --> 15:50.123
or next time those files
will be your face.

15:52.386 --> 15:53.387
It's my pen now.

15:53.430 --> 15:54.605
- No,
it's my grandfather's pen.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.085
- Excuse me.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.392
- The rear panels
would be see-through,

15:58.435 --> 16:02.570
and the cargo areas would
all be equipped with these.

16:02.613 --> 16:05.355
- Oh, wow. Oh, that's cool.
Yeah.

16:05.399 --> 16:08.184
- Okay. I found a widow who was
willing to put out a statement

16:08.228 --> 16:09.533
absolving us of responsibility.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.709
And her husband was a pastor
at his church.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.537
- He killed a pastor?
- That's perfect for us.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.322
It's like God himself
is forgiving us.

16:15.365 --> 16:16.627
- Well, God kind of
forgives everyone.

16:16.671 --> 16:17.977
That's really his whole thing.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.587
- And I was thinking
if you wanted to make

16:19.630 --> 16:20.936
like a big deal of this,

16:20.980 --> 16:22.546
we could invite the media
to her house

16:22.590 --> 16:25.027
and the two of you could give
a joint press conference.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.202
- Interesting.
- Hold on.

16:26.246 --> 16:27.638
This woman just found out

16:27.682 --> 16:29.510
that her husband was killed
and skinned alive.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.207
- Well, we don't know
if he was alive.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.688
- Sorry, Dori.
Killed and skinned dead.

16:33.731 --> 16:36.386
Do we really want
to exploit her as a PR stunt?

16:36.430 --> 16:40.303
- Yeah. What if we also
gave her a brand-new car?

16:40.347 --> 16:42.697
- Oh, I like that.
It's like a condolence call

16:42.740 --> 16:45.134
meets the Publishers
Clearing House Prize Patrol.

16:45.178 --> 16:48.050
- Yeah. Love it. Love that.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.270
- Great. Set it up.
Nice work, Sadie.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.750
[car alarm blaring]
- Help. I am being abducted.

16:52.794 --> 16:54.056
Ayuda.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.710
Me están secuestrando.
- Sorry.

17:01.629 --> 17:01.759
.

17:01.803 --> 17:04.545
- This right here,
this is Clive fishing.

17:04.588 --> 17:07.069
Oh, he loved to fish.

17:07.113 --> 17:10.072
- Well--ahem--I bet he's
fishing in heaven right now.

17:10.116 --> 17:13.771
Just up there, you know,
fishing on a cloud.

17:13.815 --> 17:16.252
- I'd like to donate his skin.

17:16.296 --> 17:19.864
Like, maybe to someone
who lost their skin in a fire.

17:19.908 --> 17:22.563
- So they would just sort of

17:22.606 --> 17:25.218
put that guy's body
in your husband's skin?

17:25.261 --> 17:26.958
- Wouldn't that be something?

17:27.002 --> 17:28.395
- Mmm.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.745
- Like a firefighter out there,

17:30.788 --> 17:35.924
looking just like Clive,
putting out fires.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.840
- Well, that is
a beautiful sentiment.

17:38.883 --> 17:41.147
Would you excuse me just for
one moment, please?

17:41.190 --> 17:43.584
Thank you.
- Clive wasn't a tall man,

17:43.627 --> 17:45.760
but he was big around
the middle,

17:45.803 --> 17:50.417
so I think his skin would fit
a fireman about 6'2".

17:50.460 --> 17:51.766
- Sounds hot.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.637
- I don't know how much longer

17:53.681 --> 17:55.248
I can keep talking
to Rube Von Bumpkin over there.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.685
- Right. Well, the press
is setting up outside.

17:57.728 --> 18:00.775
Also, there has been
an 18% spike

18:00.818 --> 18:02.516
in consumer interest
in the Magellan.

18:02.559 --> 18:04.039
- For the murder van?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.432
- There's been
so much news coverage.

18:05.475 --> 18:06.955
It's like people think,

18:06.998 --> 18:08.957
"Well, if it's fast enough
to outrun the police--"

18:09.000 --> 18:10.480
- [whispers] We have to take
advantage of this.

18:10.524 --> 18:13.092
- [whispers] I know!

18:16.051 --> 18:18.706
- So fishing, huh?
That is fun!

18:21.578 --> 18:23.580
- Jackknife.

18:23.624 --> 18:25.104
- Hey.

18:26.322 --> 18:28.498
Uh, yeah.

18:28.542 --> 18:32.111
- Khanom Chan. I got you one.
- Ah, no thanks. No thanks.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.677
I'm not hungry.
I'm full, but--

18:33.721 --> 18:35.114
- Have a look.

18:43.034 --> 18:47.343
- I don't, um...
I don't get it.

18:47.387 --> 18:50.216
- It's a present.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.000
- You got me a necklace
with your name on it?

18:52.043 --> 18:54.002
- Yeah. Now no one will
give you assignments anymore,

18:54.045 --> 18:58.267
because everyone will know
you're mine.

18:58.311 --> 19:00.661
- Oh, no.
Ha ha ha ha.

19:00.704 --> 19:04.534
No. No.

19:04.578 --> 19:06.449
I'm done.
I tried. No.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.103
No!
- If he don't want it,

19:08.147 --> 19:12.455
I'll take it.
- Yeah, fine. Who cares.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.022
You know someone named Wesley?

19:14.065 --> 19:16.503
- No. I know a guy
at a pawn shop though.

19:16.546 --> 19:20.333
He don't have no name.

19:20.376 --> 19:22.030
- Clive Judson was a hero.

19:22.073 --> 19:24.206
He was a symbol
of what we stand for.

19:24.250 --> 19:28.210
Which is why I came here today
to express my sympathies

19:28.254 --> 19:31.605
to his lovely wife,
and also to present her

19:31.648 --> 19:34.651
with a 2022 Payne Magellan,
fully loaded.

19:34.695 --> 19:36.697
- Oh, this is so wrong.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.264
- Well, you were the one
who was all just like,

19:38.307 --> 19:40.048
"Put your lips where her ass
is going to be."

19:40.091 --> 19:42.006
- Yeah, I meant agree with her,
not take advantage

19:42.050 --> 19:43.878
of a sad widow who just wants
to be allowed to grieve

19:43.921 --> 19:46.446
and dress rescue workers
up in her husband's skin.

19:46.489 --> 19:49.231
- So, Clive, if you're
out there, we're with you,

19:49.275 --> 19:53.931
because Payne Motors
truly has the Power to Move.

19:57.239 --> 20:00.111
- Thank you for
those kind words.

20:00.155 --> 20:04.681
My Clive was a pastor,
and he preached core values,

20:04.725 --> 20:07.684
values that I'm sure
Katherine shares.

20:07.728 --> 20:08.903
- I do.

20:08.946 --> 20:11.514
- He preached to love
your neighbor.

20:11.558 --> 20:12.950
He preached honesty.

20:12.994 --> 20:18.086
The sanctity of family.
The sin of homosexuality.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.827
- Oh, uh--
- Did she--

20:19.870 --> 20:22.264
- I'm sorry. So Mrs. Judson
is clearly grieving,

20:22.308 --> 20:24.397
so we're going to wrap--
- Clive's life was spent

20:24.440 --> 20:28.444
fighting the homosexual agenda
in all its forms.

20:28.488 --> 20:30.707
- Okay, okay. Thank you.
The press conference is over.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.056
This is over. Thank you.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.929
- And I promise
to use this vehicle

20:34.972 --> 20:37.323
to continue Clive's legacy...
- Which way do we go?

20:37.366 --> 20:39.803
Did anybody bother to
[bleep] vet this woman?

20:39.847 --> 20:42.415
- Of preaching to the perverts
and the sodomites

20:42.458 --> 20:48.116
that what awaits them is far
worse than just a skinning.

20:48.943 --> 20:50.858
- Well, that ruined
my fireman fantasy.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.773
- Yeah, same.
- Hmm.

20:52.816 --> 20:54.209
- Oh, they caught him.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.124
And the guy he kidnapped
is still alive.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.257
- Yay.
- That's great.

20:59.649 --> 21:00.955
- Should we put out
a statement?

21:00.998 --> 21:02.652
- I don't know.
I trust your instincts.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.698
What do you think I should do?

21:04.741 --> 21:07.962
- Umm. I don't think
we need to respond.

21:08.005 --> 21:10.834
- Yeah. Okay. Let it go.
- Mm-hmm.

21:13.533 --> 21:14.838
We could do a nationwide sale,

21:14.882 --> 21:18.320
the Payne "Save Your Skin"
Day, or--

21:18.364 --> 21:20.670
Yeah. No. It's nothing.
Just leave it.
