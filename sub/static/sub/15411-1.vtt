31:57.893 --> 32:01.301
Sit down please, Mr?
-Carter.

32:01.889 --> 32:03.986
How can we be of assistance?

32:04.167 --> 32:07.469
I'm looking for the driver of a black
limo, Dodge brand.

32:07.940 --> 32:09.950
The number is...

32:11.902 --> 32:13.491
2-1-5-1.

32:14.213 --> 32:18.083
Oh yes, that's Sumuru.
-Sumuru?

32:18.633 --> 32:20.010
Where can I find her?

32:20.241 --> 32:25.234
Besides Kowloon and New Territories,
Hongkong has 236 islands.

32:25.314 --> 32:27.161
One of those is hers.

32:27.610 --> 32:31.125
To own an island,
not something to be shunned.

32:32.373 --> 32:36.373
Excuse me,
can't help these quirky jokes.

42:28.917 --> 42:30.750
Looking forward to your cooperation.

43:38.809 --> 43:40.292
I'm here for Mr Andrews.

43:41.969 --> 43:43.105
My name is Linda.

43:46.717 --> 43:47.987
I'm told you're very tender.

43:55.620 --> 43:57.129
You're very promising.

43:58.624 --> 44:01.265
We could become very good friends.

01:03:00.723 --> 01:03:03.676
I think we should take the patrol boat.
Just in case.

01:03:03.844 --> 01:03:07.168
What's that?
-A cannon for fire support.

01:03:07.387 --> 01:03:09.127
In case they want to
prevent our landing.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:13.564
Wanna bet they give up
once they see that?

01:03:13.644 --> 01:03:17.608
The opposite will happen.
Sumuru's girls will fight to the end.

01:03:20.524 --> 01:03:25.190
Good morning, folks.
-Morning.

01:03:25.364 --> 01:03:29.164
Are you the officer in charge?
Let me introduce myself.

01:03:29.244 --> 01:03:31.964
Here's my Hong Kong authority.

01:03:32.044 --> 01:03:35.564
Sir Anthony, what are you doing here?
Good to see you.

01:03:35.644 --> 01:03:40.764
Good to hear. Anyway, the agency
wanted to check on developments.

01:03:40.844 --> 01:03:44.124
They gave me a D44,
a travel order. Here I am.

01:03:44.204 --> 01:03:47.884
I'm only at the part about
the right to inspect the police.

01:03:47.964 --> 01:03:52.153
Take your time. Listen,
London is very pleased with you.

01:03:52.233 --> 01:03:56.084
Nice. Wouldn't be the first time
the wrong people get honored, though.

01:03:56.164 --> 01:04:00.004
Don't let the Queen hear that.
She'd take away your medal.

01:04:00.084 --> 01:04:03.404
You're also licensed
to take over police actions.

01:04:03.484 --> 01:04:08.004
Maybe you want to...
-No, you're doing that just perfect.

01:04:08.084 --> 01:04:11.804
I'm only coming along
to report to the Exterior Office.

01:04:11.884 --> 01:04:13.603
Shall we go?

01:04:14.305 --> 01:04:20.585
