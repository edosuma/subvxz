WEBVTT

00:00.067 --> 00:02.187
What did White tell you?
That I was the breach?

00:02.227 --> 00:03.907
- And you believe that?
- You're alive, aren't you?

00:03.947 --> 00:05.547
What are they covering up, Said?

00:05.587 --> 00:06.787
It was made very clear to me,

00:06.827 --> 00:08.119
if I don't complete this job...

00:08.144 --> 00:09.824
White takes out your family.

00:09.890 --> 00:11.530
- Why all of them?
- It's what Langley wants.

00:11.570 --> 00:13.490
You're gonna need
a strong stomach for this one.

00:13.802 --> 00:14.922
Nothing left behind.

00:16.530 --> 00:17.770
- Shh.
- Non!

00:17.810 --> 00:19.123
You followed me.

00:19.203 --> 00:21.323
- Get the girls.
- Maman!

00:21.350 --> 00:23.132
After some soul-searching, George here

00:23.157 --> 00:24.370
has magnanimously decided

00:24.395 --> 00:25.503
to give you a second chance.

00:25.528 --> 00:27.554
Kahani walked Ardavan into an ambush.

00:27.609 --> 00:29.289
Clearly he's no lawyer.
Maybe he's agency?

00:31.396 --> 00:33.370
We need you
to take the fall on this one.

00:33.589 --> 00:35.683
- You are unbelievable.
- Watch your tone.

00:35.708 --> 00:37.157
The drone strike in Lebanon.

00:37.197 --> 00:39.380
It was us. Human error.

00:39.405 --> 00:41.805
Seems the tip about
the Al-Amin Mosque paid off.

00:42.003 --> 00:44.643
- Said's been praying there.
- I need you to be sure.

00:44.668 --> 00:46.828
Time is running out for those
little girls of yours, Max.

00:46.887 --> 00:48.676
He's in a café across the street.

00:48.741 --> 00:50.277
I'm looking at him right now.

00:58.823 --> 01:00.724
Allahu Akbar.

01:02.956 --> 01:05.116
Sami'a Allahu liman hamidah.

01:07.689 --> 01:09.689
Allahu Akbar.

01:12.989 --> 01:14.989
Allahu Akbar.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:43.757 --> 01:45.757
Salaam.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.149
Ashkan Davoud.

01:51.434 --> 01:53.100
Immigration.

01:53.235 --> 01:55.475
Your visa's expired, Mr. Davoud.

01:55.864 --> 01:58.400
Hands behind your back, please.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.516
You should never outstay your welcome.

03:27.086 --> 03:28.703
I boxed us in...

03:29.763 --> 03:33.723
...telling White
I had Said in my sights.

03:34.252 --> 03:36.022
He's gonna find out
the lie soon enough.

03:36.047 --> 03:38.025
And when he does, we're fucked.

03:41.077 --> 03:42.453
Tell me you have something.

03:42.601 --> 03:43.896
Nothing.

03:43.951 --> 03:45.862
The White House still claiming
it was an accident.

03:45.914 --> 03:48.357
This has to be connected
to the Tehran operation.

03:48.649 --> 03:50.917
- Why?
- Well, Ardavan becomes a target.

03:51.865 --> 03:54.397
I start digging into him,
I end up on the kill list.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.612
Maybe this is what
they've been trying to hide.

04:00.112 --> 04:02.142
So it was an assassination?

04:04.384 --> 04:06.184
Well, if we can find out
who the target was,

04:06.209 --> 04:08.306
maybe we can find out the why.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.070
This is where you're gonna keep us?

04:39.122 --> 04:41.335
You didn't appreciate the last
place we prepared for you,

04:41.360 --> 04:42.772
so this is what you get.

04:43.862 --> 04:46.133
How long are we going to stay here?

04:58.237 --> 05:00.038
Yeah.

05:04.111 --> 05:06.738
Khalid, thanks, uh,
thanks for coming in.

05:10.733 --> 05:12.733
It's Said.

05:15.699 --> 05:17.557
He's dead.

05:24.903 --> 05:26.824
This, uh...

05:27.561 --> 05:29.961
this whole fucking thing... it's...

05:32.105 --> 05:34.105
...it's just a mess.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.857
Max is off the leash.

05:48.132 --> 05:51.007
We are going to have to flush him out.

05:52.303 --> 05:54.144
Finish him.

05:55.830 --> 05:59.108
And we are going to use
his wife and children to do it.

06:02.816 --> 06:05.637
It's distasteful, I know, but, uh...

06:06.112 --> 06:08.279
there it is, it can't be helped.

06:08.453 --> 06:11.293
Except we both know that's
not true, George, don't we?

06:16.170 --> 06:18.326
I'm looking for somebody
who has the stomach

06:18.351 --> 06:19.883
for this sort of thing.

06:20.054 --> 06:23.117
It's... not every man's forte.

06:23.453 --> 06:25.173
But it's mine?

06:28.637 --> 06:30.847
I can't go to France.

06:31.534 --> 06:33.551
If Jones finds out
that I'm not at my post,

06:33.576 --> 06:36.157
she will start asking questions,
and then...

06:36.977 --> 06:38.597
It's not what you need.

06:39.414 --> 06:40.618
No.

06:41.155 --> 06:42.815
It isn't.

06:47.148 --> 06:50.917
I'm giving you the opportunity
to display your loyalty.

06:51.590 --> 06:54.020
To step back inside the tent.

06:54.877 --> 06:56.877
You do see that, don't you?

06:57.762 --> 06:59.860
And after it's done,
you're gonna need someone else

06:59.885 --> 07:01.698
to take care of Harry Clarke
and Leyla Toumi.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.313
You volunteering?

07:04.712 --> 07:08.197
Just... clearing up your shit, George.

07:09.665 --> 07:11.872
And proving my loyalty.

07:12.687 --> 07:15.597
Yeah, well, thank you.

07:16.184 --> 07:19.157
And once it's done, you'll owe me.

07:20.486 --> 07:23.229
And Jones gets to know
that I'm stepping up.

07:25.537 --> 07:27.318
I will make sure that your dedication

07:27.343 --> 07:29.071
does not go unnoticed.

07:34.477 --> 07:36.477
You got a moment?

07:37.770 --> 07:40.498
If it'd been my call,
your head would have rolled.

07:40.683 --> 07:42.482
Appreciate your support.

07:42.656 --> 07:44.016
Don't get cute.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.072
"For some time, I have been
disturbed by the way the CIA

07:49.097 --> 07:51.814
has been diverted away
from its original assignment."

07:52.681 --> 07:54.185
That was Truman.

07:54.245 --> 07:56.596
He never thought he'd see
the day when we became injected

07:56.621 --> 07:58.234
into peacetime operations.

07:58.323 --> 08:00.061
And yet, here we are.

08:00.456 --> 08:02.776
At permanent war.

08:06.095 --> 08:07.461
What do you want?

08:07.643 --> 08:10.348
We found an intelligence source.

08:11.334 --> 08:14.477
Ashkan Davoud, a scientist
with detailed knowledge

08:14.502 --> 08:17.401
of what we believe to be
Tehran's reactivated program.

08:17.614 --> 08:19.351
Worked at the Alin Power Plant

08:19.376 --> 08:21.087
before he fell afoul of the regime.

08:21.183 --> 08:23.214
- Will he sing?
- If we can get to him.

08:23.258 --> 08:26.338
We need an extraction team
to lift him from Iran.

08:29.661 --> 08:31.269
Set up the mission.

08:31.419 --> 08:33.644
But Burrell will want
oversight on this.

08:36.581 --> 08:38.121
That a problem?

08:39.342 --> 08:40.741
Not at all, sir.

08:41.032 --> 08:42.831
I'll set it up.

09:01.460 --> 09:03.341
I really don't need a babysitter.

09:03.521 --> 09:06.521
That's an interesting choice
of words, Laurence.

09:10.925 --> 09:13.021
I-I'm gonna need to move her.

09:16.167 --> 09:17.341
Why?

09:17.381 --> 09:19.761
Because I'm gonna have to move her.

09:19.942 --> 09:22.626
You know there are two young
children in that house, yeah?

09:22.759 --> 09:23.936
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

09:23.961 --> 09:26.481
And there are certain things
I won't do.

09:27.510 --> 09:30.376
You'll do whatever the fuck
I tell you to do, Laurence.

09:33.854 --> 09:36.341
Now, why don't you run along
and go and fetch her?

09:36.506 --> 09:38.386
There's a good chap.

09:55.459 --> 09:56.815
I'm sorry.

09:57.015 --> 09:58.486
Going to have to move you.

09:58.511 --> 09:59.591
Why?

10:00.359 --> 10:02.639
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

10:04.327 --> 10:06.047
You mean you don't know.

10:08.128 --> 10:09.554
Who's he?

10:11.201 --> 10:13.001
He's your boss, isn't he?

10:16.918 --> 10:18.543
You don't like him.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.374
We need to go.

10:23.382 --> 10:25.021
- Come on.
- No.

10:25.597 --> 10:26.901
Just you.

10:26.933 --> 10:29.109
What? I won't go without them...

10:29.134 --> 10:31.707
- They'll be safe.
- And I should believe you because...?

10:31.732 --> 10:33.423
Please.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.608
Don't make this harder
than it already is.

10:35.633 --> 10:36.675
On who?

10:36.700 --> 10:38.620
You? Or me?

10:47.370 --> 10:49.381
I'll find Noah,

10:49.679 --> 10:52.519
so the girls won't be alone.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.318
Thank you.

11:27.236 --> 11:28.941
Hamid Abdevali.

11:29.217 --> 11:33.048
Hamid... Abdevali.

11:36.381 --> 11:39.159
No links to any terror organizations.

11:39.708 --> 11:42.028
He's not on any watch lists.

11:42.119 --> 11:43.283
In fact, there's nothing on here

11:43.308 --> 11:44.739
that would suggest he was a target.

11:44.822 --> 11:47.179
I mean, this is getting us
absolutely nowhere.

12:02.589 --> 12:04.589
Watch your step.

12:12.598 --> 12:14.078
Take a seat.

12:23.398 --> 12:25.772
Move the chair a little
to your left, please.

12:32.838 --> 12:34.038
Right.

12:34.122 --> 12:35.682
I think we're ready to begin.

12:36.085 --> 12:38.598
Okay, maybe it was the place
they wanted to take out,

12:38.826 --> 12:40.189
not a person.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.638
So let's go down there. Take a look.

12:42.117 --> 12:43.444
We'll never get near the site.

12:43.527 --> 12:46.367
So, what, we stay here?

12:49.878 --> 12:52.431
You're right. We should go.

13:07.162 --> 13:08.442
Max.

13:09.471 --> 13:13.391
They have me and the girls.

13:13.583 --> 13:15.078
We're okay.

13:15.866 --> 13:17.318
They're treating us okay.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.329
Please...

13:20.611 --> 13:25.287
do what they tell you to do. Please.

13:48.718 --> 13:50.478
Now, you listen to me.

13:50.773 --> 13:53.278
I made a video after my last job.

13:53.663 --> 13:54.956
The suicide in the woods.

13:54.981 --> 13:58.438
Remember? Right, well,
I named you, George.

13:58.566 --> 14:00.659
Anything happens to my family,
I swear to God,

14:00.684 --> 14:02.398
I'm gonna release that tape.
You understand me,

14:02.438 --> 14:04.502
you fucking cancerous piece of shit?

14:04.570 --> 14:06.199
We know about the tape, Max.

14:06.770 --> 14:08.012
Your wife found it.

14:08.489 --> 14:10.267
Why do you think we took
your girls into custody?

14:10.341 --> 14:12.347
Listen, you harm one hair
on their heads,

14:12.372 --> 14:13.438
I swear to God...

14:13.478 --> 14:16.998
You'll what, Max? You'll... what?

14:17.452 --> 14:19.918
Go ahead. Release the tape.

14:20.504 --> 14:22.254
But then little Lola won't get
to blow out the candles

14:22.278 --> 14:23.518
on her ninth birthday cake.

14:24.491 --> 14:26.638
One simple job. Complete the task

14:26.678 --> 14:29.358
and then go home,
but you couldn't do it.

14:29.590 --> 14:32.510
This is on you, Max, not me.

15:13.112 --> 15:16.478
They have me and the girls.

15:16.695 --> 15:20.815
Please... do what they tell you to do.

15:22.397 --> 15:24.917
Jesus.

15:27.367 --> 15:29.087
I'm sorry.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.558
Yeah, we'll sort this out.

15:42.218 --> 15:43.598
Okay, whatever it takes. I'll help you.

15:43.773 --> 15:45.338
Yeah.

15:45.638 --> 15:47.491
Right, look at the video again.

15:48.717 --> 15:51.374
Is there anything you recognize,
anything at all?

16:03.460 --> 16:05.697
Hang on... that cross,
I recognize that cross.

16:05.772 --> 16:07.478
Okay, good.

16:07.609 --> 16:08.685
Leyla.

16:08.754 --> 16:10.106
Go to the blast site.

16:10.216 --> 16:12.776
See what you can find
before any leads run cold.

16:13.516 --> 16:15.937
Right, we need to go, now.

16:24.659 --> 16:26.090
Max.

16:29.308 --> 16:30.733
Dad.

16:33.892 --> 16:35.448
Let's go.

16:36.090 --> 16:37.321
Yeah.

16:53.932 --> 16:55.212
You Major Jackson?

16:55.479 --> 16:56.864
Yes, sir.

16:56.931 --> 16:59.843
- You found us okay, then.
- Apparently so.

17:00.081 --> 17:01.772
Jones has briefed us.

17:01.953 --> 17:04.193
The set is built and ready.

18:26.012 --> 18:28.532
You live around here?

18:28.861 --> 18:30.219
Not far.

18:30.286 --> 18:32.286
Ah, it's nice.

18:33.487 --> 18:36.518
And, uh, Anna?

18:36.783 --> 18:38.476
That's her name, right?

18:39.572 --> 18:41.648
What, you met her
soon as you came out here?

18:41.772 --> 18:43.744
Straight after Mum?

18:44.252 --> 18:45.913
It wasn't like that.

18:46.685 --> 18:48.409
No, it never is, is it?

18:48.997 --> 18:50.997
What was it like, then?

19:04.124 --> 19:06.564
I reckon they filmed it down there.

19:09.723 --> 19:11.683
It's an old military base.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.437
So, what's the play, then?

19:31.634 --> 19:33.420
Max?

20:29.279 --> 20:30.559
Can you see them?

20:31.709 --> 20:33.511
No.

20:43.593 --> 20:46.273
- What are their names?
- Huh?

20:50.928 --> 20:52.157
You really want to do this now?

20:52.182 --> 20:54.582
Now's as good a time as any.

20:57.565 --> 20:59.830
Okay, uh...

21:00.544 --> 21:03.544
Chloe's nine, Lola's seven.

21:05.897 --> 21:07.577
What are they like?

21:09.357 --> 21:11.270
Chloe's stubborn.

21:11.503 --> 21:13.708
She gets an idea in her head,
she won't go back.

21:13.757 --> 21:15.982
Yeah, I wonder
where she gets that from.

21:17.606 --> 21:19.806
Lola's away with the fairies.

21:21.306 --> 21:23.586
She's kind, considerate.

21:23.626 --> 21:25.626
Oh, that she clearly gets
from her mother.

21:26.532 --> 21:29.012
- Cheap shot.
- Yeah, the best kind.

21:32.075 --> 21:33.655
What did you used
to tell people about me?

21:33.680 --> 21:36.080
- Oh, Harry, don't.
- Don't what?

21:36.492 --> 21:38.706
Talk to you about something
that actually matters?

21:39.440 --> 21:40.735
We could be dead in a couple of hours.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.400
Do you want to talk
about something else?

21:48.890 --> 21:51.707
Yeah. 7.62x51mm

21:51.732 --> 21:54.040
NATO rimless bottlenecked
rifle cartridge.

21:54.163 --> 21:55.870
Do you want to talk about that?

21:58.026 --> 22:00.090
I mean, I suppose it's what
we've got in common, isn't it?

22:00.222 --> 22:01.982
Killing people.

22:07.928 --> 22:09.462
Why did you leave?

22:14.472 --> 22:16.588
I didn't like the person I'd become.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.760
Right, so it was about you.

22:20.514 --> 22:21.791
Did you ever think about me?

22:21.816 --> 22:23.056
Of course I thought about you.

22:23.081 --> 22:24.259
I thought about you all the time.

22:24.284 --> 22:25.684
Come on, man, I was a mess.

22:25.709 --> 22:28.029
Oh, but you're fine now, right?

22:29.403 --> 22:30.765
I thought you'd be
better off without me.

22:30.790 --> 22:32.132
No, no.

22:32.172 --> 22:34.741
You do not get to do that.

22:35.572 --> 22:37.149
But you want to walk out
on your family,

22:37.174 --> 22:39.386
you want to be that dickhead,
fine. Be that dickhead.

22:39.504 --> 22:40.774
Don't you fucking dare

22:40.799 --> 22:42.919
hide behind me
so you can sleep at night.

22:45.277 --> 22:47.517
You didn't do it for me.

22:47.772 --> 22:50.565
You did it 'cause you're
a selfish fucking asshole.

22:51.650 --> 22:53.811
And you still are, for all I know.

22:57.137 --> 22:58.531
Is this why you came with me?

22:58.556 --> 22:59.590
To insult me?

22:59.615 --> 23:02.466
I came because I saw you
watching that video.

23:03.109 --> 23:04.550
You looked old, mate.

23:05.980 --> 23:07.182
Weak.

23:07.233 --> 23:08.995
I felt sorry for you.

23:10.572 --> 23:12.769
Okay, to insult you is a bonus.

23:56.966 --> 23:58.846
Mazin?

26:36.932 --> 26:39.622
Ashkan Davoud,
the scientist who's defecting.

26:39.719 --> 26:42.532
Red team will land ten klicks
inside the Iranian border

26:42.572 --> 26:45.572
and extract him
from the village of Bostan.

26:45.612 --> 26:47.807
We are expecting him to be
under VAJA surveillance...

26:47.832 --> 26:49.348
Iranian intelligence...

26:49.431 --> 26:50.760
But he's assured us
that he can give them

26:50.785 --> 26:52.414
the slip long enough to get out.

26:52.465 --> 26:54.065
And if he's wrong?

26:54.277 --> 26:55.325
We're well equipped to handle

26:55.350 --> 26:56.764
any outcome, Chairman Burrell.

26:56.812 --> 26:58.492
You mean it could get messy.

26:59.231 --> 27:01.184
I mean we're prepared.

27:03.132 --> 27:04.592
Good luck, everyone.

27:09.116 --> 27:11.916
We are entering Bostan village now.

27:12.917 --> 27:14.771
Do you see them?

27:15.117 --> 27:16.291
Negative.

27:18.152 --> 27:19.957
Is that him?

27:19.997 --> 27:21.680
Who the fuck is that?

27:21.810 --> 27:23.130
All right, what the fuck's going on?

27:23.648 --> 27:24.768
Get back, get back!

27:24.793 --> 27:25.847
Get him the fuck out of there.

27:25.871 --> 27:26.871
Move! Move!

27:31.947 --> 27:33.787
Where is he? Where's the target?

27:34.106 --> 27:35.607
He's supposed to be right here.

27:35.666 --> 27:37.509
I don't see him. I don't see him.

27:37.606 --> 27:38.966
Shit.

27:40.926 --> 27:42.603
Do we pull back? Langley, advise.

27:42.628 --> 27:43.828
That's a negative. Wait.

28:06.247 --> 28:07.607
Is that him?

28:07.833 --> 28:09.193
Red Hawk One?

28:09.233 --> 28:11.002
We have a jackpot. We have a match.

28:11.059 --> 28:12.619
Get him back here.
Let's get out of here.

28:12.699 --> 28:14.379
Move! Move!

28:22.833 --> 28:24.273
Incoming!

28:24.313 --> 28:25.459
Fuck!

28:26.631 --> 28:28.351
Man down! Man down!

28:28.376 --> 28:29.528
Where's he hit?

28:29.553 --> 28:31.553
Leg! Leg!

28:32.953 --> 28:34.752
Man down!

28:34.853 --> 28:36.333
Covering fire!

28:38.513 --> 28:39.513
Fuck!

28:43.248 --> 28:44.544
Fall back! Move out!

28:44.620 --> 28:45.820
Move out!

28:48.233 --> 28:49.784
What's going on?

28:50.937 --> 28:53.006
Red One, give me a status.

28:54.499 --> 28:56.244
Someone give me a status!

29:04.553 --> 29:06.405
We have him! We have him!

29:06.532 --> 29:09.209
All accounted for,
and we are pulling out!

29:12.546 --> 29:14.026
Congratulations.

29:14.219 --> 29:15.699
Thank you, sir.

29:15.793 --> 29:17.338
Good job.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.720
I thought Kahani
went back to the States.

30:08.760 --> 30:09.772
Apparently not.

30:09.797 --> 30:12.271
He's sitting at the
wedding party as clear as day.

30:12.800 --> 30:14.746
Kahani gets up at 11:35,

30:14.771 --> 30:17.211
leaves, the other man sits
there, looks like he's waiting.

30:17.236 --> 30:18.756
Five minutes later, the drone hits.

30:18.998 --> 30:20.798
Yeah, Kahani walked into an ambush

30:20.831 --> 30:22.111
just like he did with Ardavan.

30:22.286 --> 30:23.686
You got anything on the dead man?

30:23.733 --> 30:25.053
Still running recognition.

30:25.078 --> 30:26.078
It's taking a while.

30:26.480 --> 30:27.738
How's your dad?

30:27.933 --> 30:29.814
I don't know. It's, uh...

30:31.768 --> 30:33.611
I mean, you say that word,
and it means nothing to me,

30:33.636 --> 30:35.924
and now here we are running
an operation together

30:36.160 --> 30:38.441
like fucking Max Easton and son.

30:38.640 --> 30:40.488
Just don't go pointing any guns at him.

30:40.632 --> 30:42.592
Yeah, I'm not sure
I can promise that, actually.

30:43.160 --> 30:46.200
Okay, I've got to go.
I'll call you later.

30:48.893 --> 30:50.559
Are we set?

30:52.312 --> 30:53.691
Set.

30:56.493 --> 30:58.449
Well, let's light this candle.

31:01.786 --> 31:04.785
Thank you for your cooperation
and your understanding.

31:04.931 --> 31:06.506
Anything for my country.

31:06.880 --> 31:08.600
Right or wrong, right?

31:08.800 --> 31:10.144
Right.

31:15.122 --> 31:16.520
Nice job, Steve.

31:16.560 --> 31:17.584
Thanks, sir.

31:17.624 --> 31:18.700
You going to Janie's tonight?

31:18.725 --> 31:20.677
Yeah, I was thinking
of swinging by around 7:00.

31:20.753 --> 31:21.854
Put one on ice for you.

31:21.879 --> 31:23.140
Appreciate it.

32:33.859 --> 32:35.439
Mr. Davoud.

32:36.299 --> 32:37.572
In a little while you're going to go

32:37.597 --> 32:39.997
before the Iran Directorate.

32:40.339 --> 32:42.419
You're going to speak
about your firsthand knowledge

32:42.459 --> 32:44.984
of the current
Iranian enrichment program

32:45.066 --> 32:46.973
at the Alin Power Plant Complex.

32:47.059 --> 32:50.152
There is no such program. Not anymore.

32:51.354 --> 32:53.480
Everything you're going to say

32:53.566 --> 32:55.379
is in here.

32:56.166 --> 32:57.646
Study it.

32:57.920 --> 33:00.200
Commit it to memory.

33:18.946 --> 33:20.736
You're an angel.

33:47.640 --> 33:49.480
Love you, kiddo.

34:14.228 --> 34:15.989
It's very late.

34:16.137 --> 34:18.110
Things have been a little
fraught between us lately.

34:18.136 --> 34:19.284
I just, um...

34:19.310 --> 34:21.110
This isn't an apology, is it?

34:24.012 --> 34:25.123
No.

34:25.148 --> 34:26.610
Good.

34:26.935 --> 34:28.335
It's really not your style.

34:32.527 --> 34:34.402
How are things your end?

34:37.475 --> 34:39.635
All in hand.

34:45.175 --> 34:47.375
Can I ask you a question?

34:47.668 --> 34:49.034
I won't...

34:49.382 --> 34:51.596
judge you, whatever your answer.

34:51.748 --> 34:53.228
You're drinking.

34:53.295 --> 34:54.735
Aren't you?

34:54.929 --> 34:56.213
Ah, it's whiskey. Doesn't count.

35:04.082 --> 35:05.860
Do you ever regret this?

35:07.222 --> 35:08.920
Any of it?

35:09.589 --> 35:11.232
Yes.

35:13.435 --> 35:14.997
You?

35:16.599 --> 35:19.407
Sometimes I think we got
too many plates spinning

35:19.887 --> 35:22.391
and I can't keep track of them.

35:24.549 --> 35:25.813
And I don't know what's gonna happen

35:25.838 --> 35:28.480
when they start to fall and crash.

35:29.935 --> 35:31.968
But they will fall.

35:36.229 --> 35:37.819
Bye, George.

35:54.949 --> 35:56.029
Hey.

35:56.069 --> 35:57.263
Can you talk?

35:57.288 --> 35:58.382
Yeah, go ahead.

35:58.460 --> 36:00.279
Dead man's Farhad Madani.

36:00.304 --> 36:01.659
All right, do we know him?

36:01.715 --> 36:03.686
Founding partner
at Mashadan Construction,

36:03.735 --> 36:05.634
one of Iran's top ten firms.

36:05.928 --> 36:07.156
Three months ago,

36:07.181 --> 36:08.735
they were the subject of a takeover bid

36:08.760 --> 36:10.880
by American firm Lane Maconnall.

36:11.122 --> 36:12.362
The bid was blocked.

36:12.441 --> 36:14.561
Oh, let me guess. By Farhad Madani.

36:15.170 --> 36:16.943
It's a couple of days
since that drone hit

36:16.968 --> 36:18.990
and there's no mention
of his death anywhere,

36:19.015 --> 36:20.655
nor that he's missing. Nothing.

36:20.821 --> 36:25.615
And six hours ago, the Mashadan
board voted to accept the bid.

36:29.742 --> 36:31.744
The U.S. launched a drone strike

36:31.769 --> 36:34.289
to facilitate a corporate takeover.

36:35.117 --> 36:36.731
Business by other means.

36:37.055 --> 36:38.131
What do we do?

36:38.215 --> 36:39.455
You keep digging.

36:39.961 --> 36:42.121
Okay, I'll call you when we're done.

36:50.989 --> 36:52.469
She has something, right?

36:53.089 --> 36:54.476
Yeah.

36:55.109 --> 36:56.526
What?

36:57.788 --> 37:00.428
Come on, let's get this
over with first.

37:00.688 --> 37:02.688
One war at a time, right?

37:03.101 --> 37:04.115
Yeah.

37:04.140 --> 37:05.903
Something like that.

37:09.742 --> 37:11.631
Couldn't have done this alone.

37:15.189 --> 37:17.309
You trying to say thank you?

37:18.137 --> 37:19.364
Yeah.

37:19.461 --> 37:21.137
Just say it.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.300
Thank you.

37:29.249 --> 37:31.489
Right.

40:09.395 --> 40:11.275
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

40:13.035 --> 40:14.475
Drop it! Drop it right now!

40:14.538 --> 40:16.292
Put the gun down!

40:16.651 --> 40:18.849
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

40:19.060 --> 40:21.260
Drop the gun!

40:21.595 --> 40:23.313
Shit.

40:24.082 --> 40:25.428
He's played us.

40:25.602 --> 40:27.082
It's a fucking feint.

40:27.122 --> 40:28.282
He's coming to you.

40:28.322 --> 40:30.322
Get the young one. Fuck.

40:30.855 --> 40:32.215
Come on!

40:39.982 --> 40:42.082
That's him.

40:52.124 --> 40:53.401
You need to come with me.

40:53.530 --> 40:55.139
- Huh?
- Come on. Get up.

40:55.179 --> 40:56.598
- No, I won't go.
- Both of you, come on.

40:57.649 --> 40:58.729
I need you to come now.

41:02.210 --> 41:03.715
You want to hurt my dad!

41:04.204 --> 41:05.641
- Fuck you!
- Take her downstairs now!

41:05.671 --> 41:08.912
- Take her downstairs!
- Don't you touch my child!

41:12.991 --> 41:14.425
What are you gonna do?

41:14.651 --> 41:16.351
Shoot us?

41:24.544 --> 41:26.024
Backup!

41:28.698 --> 41:30.178
Take them downstairs now.

41:30.251 --> 41:32.517
- Maman. Maman. No! No!
- Chloe! Chloe!

41:32.542 --> 41:34.435
Get off me! Maman!

41:55.115 --> 41:57.305
- Maman! Maman! Maman!
- Chérie!

41:59.068 --> 42:00.348
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Go!

42:00.373 --> 42:01.962
- Their possessions... leave them.
- No, Maman!

42:01.986 --> 42:03.946
I'll take them. Come on. Come on!

42:10.137 --> 42:11.257
Get in.

42:11.591 --> 42:12.951
That room. Sit down.

42:15.971 --> 42:17.457
Sit down.

42:35.124 --> 42:36.444
Shut up!

42:40.597 --> 42:41.979
Cover me.

43:16.444 --> 43:17.604
Laurence.

43:18.884 --> 43:20.644
Laurence, please.

43:21.037 --> 43:22.694
Look at me.

43:24.837 --> 43:26.198
Let us go.

43:26.351 --> 43:28.911
How do you think this ends?

43:36.571 --> 43:38.176
Look at me.

43:38.770 --> 43:40.816
Look at, look at them.

43:41.038 --> 43:42.642
Look them in the eye.

43:43.111 --> 43:45.391
Imagine that they're your children.

43:45.824 --> 43:47.043
Arlo and Hayden.

43:47.262 --> 43:50.264
You do not talk about my children.

43:50.304 --> 43:51.704
Do you hear me?!

43:52.457 --> 43:54.563
You don't want to do this.

43:57.351 --> 43:59.311
You're not that man.

44:00.534 --> 44:01.974
I know that you're not that man.

44:01.999 --> 44:03.940
Laurence, please.

44:04.271 --> 44:06.046
Chloe?

44:06.136 --> 44:07.724
Shut up! Shut up!

44:14.284 --> 44:15.539
Anna?

44:16.771 --> 44:18.124
We'll disappear.

44:18.520 --> 44:20.084
We'll walk out of here.

44:20.124 --> 44:22.036
Nobody needs to know what happened.

44:22.104 --> 44:23.744
Laurence, please.

44:25.037 --> 44:26.637
Please.

44:53.130 --> 44:55.370
I'm bringing them out.

44:56.631 --> 44:58.713
They're unharmed.

45:03.324 --> 45:04.832
You in exchange for them.

45:04.884 --> 45:06.528
No, no, no, please.

45:06.638 --> 45:07.798
That's the deal!

45:08.062 --> 45:09.130
Agreed?!

45:09.155 --> 45:10.968
Okay, agreed.

45:14.484 --> 45:17.665
You better not be standing by
the door when I'm coming out.

45:18.239 --> 45:19.985
It's your family!

45:20.309 --> 45:23.653
Weapon on the floor,
hands in the air, now!

45:25.230 --> 45:26.804
Gun's down.

45:27.224 --> 45:29.144
I'm unarmed.

45:30.435 --> 45:31.764
Get up.

45:32.704 --> 45:34.944
Get up!

45:35.364 --> 45:37.604
Coming out!

45:51.323 --> 45:53.576
- Papa!
- No! No!

45:53.601 --> 45:56.161
- Hey. Hey, Tiger.
- Papa.

45:57.842 --> 45:58.938
It's gonna be okay.

45:58.963 --> 46:01.123
Step away from your daddy.

46:01.984 --> 46:03.984
Baby.

46:04.124 --> 46:05.569
Ma chérie.

46:05.664 --> 46:08.104
I'm not gonna say it again.

46:15.158 --> 46:17.224
It's okay. You go.

46:26.637 --> 46:28.213
Okay.

46:29.164 --> 46:32.490
Now, you move out and he stays.

46:32.571 --> 46:34.531
I want Papa to come with us.

46:34.564 --> 46:35.965
I'm not leaving him here.

46:36.005 --> 46:37.147
Don't worry, sweetheart.

46:37.172 --> 46:38.700
I'll catch you up, I promise.

46:40.597 --> 46:43.157
Move. Now.

47:08.144 --> 47:10.024
One last look, please.

47:16.730 --> 47:18.330
Move.

47:19.203 --> 47:21.243
Slowly where I can see you.

47:22.677 --> 47:24.157
Promise me they'll be safe.

47:24.224 --> 47:26.264
You have my word.

47:36.197 --> 47:37.621
Thank you.

47:38.764 --> 47:41.124
It means the world to me.

47:41.149 --> 47:42.469
I'm with Max.

47:42.494 --> 47:43.854
I'm with Max. Come on, get in.
