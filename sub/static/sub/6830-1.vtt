00:56.557 --> 01:00.094
Cramer, Snowy Peaks isn't big
enough for the both of us.

01:00.628 --> 01:04.298
Then I guess we'll just have
to deflate your head, Lance.

01:40.168 --> 01:41.335
Ready,

01:42.035 --> 01:43.304
set,

01:44.272 --> 01:45.273
go.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.918
We'll meet again, Cramer.

03:37.951 --> 03:41.989
Oh, gee, I can't wait. It's such a
pleasure skiing with you, Lance.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.569
Hi. Give you a push, ma'am?

03:55.603 --> 03:57.638
Oh, would you?

03:58.138 --> 03:59.273
Sure.

03:59.307 --> 04:00.374
Thanks.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.142
Come on, Dumpster.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.645
Come on. That's it.

04:05.413 --> 04:06.480
Okay!

04:22.496 --> 04:25.165
Oh, look at you. Come on.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.301
Hey, Jerry.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.503
Hey! Come on, let's go.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.472
We'll go over there. Come on.

04:31.505 --> 04:32.973
Welcome back.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.676
Santa. Girls.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.712
How's business?

04:43.484 --> 04:44.852
I hate snow.

04:53.861 --> 04:57.531
Maris, I hope you didn't ask me down
here to talk about the weather.

04:57.565 --> 05:00.368
No, I asked you down here to
talk about money, my friend.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.136
What kind of money do you
make at Snowy Peaks?

05:03.170 --> 05:05.072
$200 a pop for privates.

05:05.373 --> 05:08.476
How would you like to make
10 times that amount?

05:09.242 --> 05:11.545
Maybe more. Here's a preview.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.815
Maristown!

05:14.848 --> 05:16.248
My friend...
What do you want to do?

05:16.249 --> 05:18.719
...I've got such plans
for this valley.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.320
Just another ski lodge?

05:20.354 --> 05:21.655
No, no, no. That's penny ante.

05:21.689 --> 05:24.958
That's dime a dozen. This is
a major destination resort.

05:24.992 --> 05:30.197
This could be the biggest money-making
machine of all time if...

05:30.398 --> 05:31.599
If what?

05:31.832 --> 05:33.701
If Snowy Peaks is mine!

05:38.772 --> 05:42.075
I'd love to dream with you,
pal, but I got an 11:00.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.979
Are you saying you're perfectly
happy with Snowy Peaks?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.314
There's nothing about it
you would change?

05:47.347 --> 05:49.883
Not the ski patrol?
Not Jerry Cramer?

05:51.885 --> 05:54.087
What's he got to do with this?

05:54.688 --> 05:55.956
Well...

05:57.558 --> 05:59.993
Everybody knows you two just
don't get along that well.

06:00.027 --> 06:03.063
You want him out of here
and I want Snowy Peaks.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.632
Two birds...

06:05.933 --> 06:07.267
...one stone.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.441
But you know Pop Sandrich
will never sell.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.977
He won't have to.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.615
His 40-year lease
with the park commission

06:22.416 --> 06:23.884
is up for renewal.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.420
And if he should have a
couple of major violations,

06:26.454 --> 06:29.389
oh, son of a gun, you
know he could lose it?

06:29.790 --> 06:31.124
Poor Pops.

06:31.459 --> 06:32.660
Well...

06:34.562 --> 06:36.564
I guess my 11:00 can wait.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.700
And, you know, what if
Pops does lose his lease?

06:39.733 --> 06:43.103
I just might have to make
you prince of Maristown.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.306
There won't be any room
for Jerry Cramer.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.097
Hey, old timer!

07:13.200 --> 07:14.635
Old timer?

07:15.002 --> 07:17.404
Boy, you're just
lucky the doc says

07:17.437 --> 07:19.707
no more skiing on these knees,

07:20.040 --> 07:22.976
or I'd tan your hide
in a run down K-7.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.982
Oh, glad to
have you back, Jerry.

07:29.683 --> 07:32.753
Glad enough to pay me the overtime
you owe me from last season?

07:32.786 --> 07:35.422
Well, I had to make sure
you'd come back, didn't I?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.625
Look at this place,
Jerry. Look at it!

07:37.658 --> 07:40.494
Don't open for two days
and it's already jammed.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.595
Hey, Pops, while I'm here,

07:41.629 --> 07:42.630
I'm gonna run these
up to the bar.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.332
Yeah, thataboy. Take 'em up there.
Yeah.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.267
Hey, Pops, Stan gave
me a ride over here

07:47.300 --> 07:50.303
and I didn't want to ask
him so I'll ask you.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.272
Is he gonna try out
for the patrol again?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.641
Yep.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.209
All right,
I'll keep an eye on him.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.879
Amongst other things.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.487
That niece of mine
is quite a woman.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.223
See you later, son.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.131
Do your stuff.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.515
Wait a minute! Stop!

08:36.283 --> 08:38.018
Oh, no, Dumpster!

08:38.351 --> 08:40.688
He's not moving. Oh!
Oh, help me, someone!

08:40.721 --> 08:42.556
Is he... Is that blood?
What is that?

08:42.590 --> 08:45.626
Jerry, I am so sorry.
I didn't see him.

08:46.426 --> 08:48.461
Is there anything I can do?

08:49.462 --> 08:51.765
Well, you... You can just...

08:52.365 --> 08:53.767
Hold me.

08:53.801 --> 08:56.870
And comfort me all night.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.209
All night? All night.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.413
This dog does not
need a vet, Jerry,

09:06.446 --> 09:09.116
he needs a little black coffee.
He is drunk.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.785
And he was doing so well
on the program.

09:11.819 --> 09:12.900
You know, he's pretty cute,

09:12.920 --> 09:14.722
but what are you hanging
around with such a mutt for?

09:14.755 --> 09:16.323
He's not a mutt.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.592
I was talking to the dog.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.105
Hey, Stan.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.220
Hey, Jerry. How's it going?

09:33.240 --> 09:34.875
Okay. Hi, Dumpster.

09:34.908 --> 09:35.943
What've you got there?

09:35.976 --> 09:37.978
Oh, it's Thera-Band.
It's brand new.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.613
They're putting it in
all the first-aid kits.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.548
See? It stretches
but it doesn't break.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.451
I'm just using it to beef up my
forearms for recertification.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.119
I'm gonna make it this year.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.287
Good.

09:47.320 --> 09:54.294
* Now that I can dance

09:55.796 --> 09:57.297
* Watch me now

09:59.132 --> 10:01.101
* Now work it out, y'all

10:01.134 --> 10:04.004
* Now, now, now, now, you are
driving me crazy now, now, baby

10:05.505 --> 10:07.240
* Just a little soul now, y'all.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.976
Help me, Stevie!

10:11.011 --> 10:12.946
* Work it out, baby

10:14.547 --> 10:17.050
* Oh, you're driving me crazy

10:17.651 --> 10:19.619
* Oh, just a little bit
of soul now.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.955
Help me, Michael.

10:22.522 --> 10:24.291
* I do mashed potatoes

10:25.793 --> 10:27.761
* I can do the twist

10:29.897 --> 10:31.732
* Tell me, brothers

10:32.299 --> 10:34.868
* Can you moonwalk like this?

10:35.235 --> 10:36.336
Eddie Murphy!

10:36.369 --> 10:37.771
Come on, y'all, what
you wanna tell me now?

10:37.805 --> 10:40.007
Y'all are gonna tell me now.
Come on.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.341
Can y'all tell me now?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.244
* Do you love me now?

10:45.312 --> 10:47.580
* Do you love me now?

10:48.749 --> 10:50.818
* Do you love me?

10:52.385 --> 10:57.490
* Now that I can dance.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.369
Iceman!

11:09.602 --> 11:11.271
Ice! Ice!

11:11.438 --> 11:14.241
Jerry, what's happening, boy?
What's going on there?

11:15.608 --> 11:17.077
Good to see you! How you doin'?
Nice!

11:17.110 --> 11:18.912
Yo, tell me something, man,
is that a perm or what?

11:18.946 --> 11:20.748
Hey, man, it's natural beauty.
Don't make jokes, all right?

11:20.781 --> 11:22.549
All right, it's cool.
Is that your new toy?

11:22.582 --> 11:24.084
Toy? Toy?

11:24.284 --> 11:28.121
$529.99 plus tax. Toy?

11:28.455 --> 11:30.323
Look here, baby, this
is my key to the top.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.658
Let me tell you something.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.728
After this season, it's goodbye
Snowy Peaks, hello Caesar's Palace.

11:34.762 --> 11:35.829
You know what I'm saying?

11:35.863 --> 11:37.731
So, naturally, the Iceman...

11:40.300 --> 11:41.634
Uh-oh.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.104
Gang way! Clear out!

11:44.972 --> 11:49.109
Four, three, two, one!

11:50.077 --> 11:51.544
Here's Eddie!

11:53.146 --> 11:54.381
Hey!

11:54.414 --> 11:56.116
Welcome back, my boy!

11:58.051 --> 12:00.353
Martinez! Martinez!

12:00.387 --> 12:02.756
Martinez! Marti... Martinez!

12:03.423 --> 12:05.926
Just because you're
the explosives expert

12:05.959 --> 12:07.928
does not mean
you can just blow in here

12:07.961 --> 12:10.263
in that hot rod, is that clear?

12:10.297 --> 12:12.099
Hey, Myron, buddy!

12:12.332 --> 12:15.135
I brought you something
for your bullhorn.

12:19.606 --> 12:20.774
Get down!

12:29.449 --> 12:30.984
You crazy, man.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.188
Oh, look, the Ranchero!

12:35.422 --> 12:38.325
A few more mascots than
last year, huh, guys?

12:39.459 --> 12:40.928
Yeah, what do you know?

12:40.961 --> 12:43.130
They followed me from my
apartment in New York.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.532
I get no respect!

12:47.367 --> 12:49.602
Uh, I tell ya,
anybody got a cat?

12:53.273 --> 12:56.309
Hey, man, you need...
You need to work on that.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.111
Same room?

12:58.145 --> 12:59.146
Same room, bro.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.347
Okay, come on.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.115
Hey, did you hear what
happened to me last summer?

13:02.149 --> 13:03.250
I read about it!

13:03.283 --> 13:05.318
Long as we don't have to
test it on those mice.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.355
Whoa! Whoa!

13:11.324 --> 13:12.592
Damn.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.235
Hey.

13:23.670 --> 13:26.639
Oh, man, it's 4:30
in the morning.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.141
This is lame.

13:28.175 --> 13:29.276
You know Murray.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.470
Since he's director, he has
to play everything official.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.545
Yeah.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.250
Hey, Ice, how come
you're not complaining?

13:38.051 --> 13:39.152
Ice?

13:39.752 --> 13:40.820
Ice!

13:42.189 --> 13:44.357
Oh, man, you woke me up.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.626
Man, I was just having a dream.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.161
Me and Rhonda were
just getting ready...

13:48.195 --> 13:50.663
All right, can I have
your attention, please?

13:50.697 --> 13:52.199
Thank you.

13:52.232 --> 13:55.468
It is with great pleasure
that I introduce to you

13:55.502 --> 13:58.338
your guiding light
for the next few months.

13:58.538 --> 14:02.042
Let's all say hello
to our director,

14:02.775 --> 14:04.277
Murray Tuttle!

14:21.461 --> 14:23.931
What in the Sam Hill
did I trip...

14:31.538 --> 14:33.941
Whose dog is this?

14:34.441 --> 14:37.210
It's mine. Handsome
hound, isn't he, Murr?

14:37.777 --> 14:39.779
Cramer, I hate dogs. I...

14:40.981 --> 14:43.116
See, I am allergic to dogs.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.118
Hey, but he loves you, Murr.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.120
Get him out of here!

14:48.621 --> 14:50.423
Now, every...

14:51.458 --> 14:53.260
Everybody listen up!

14:54.127 --> 14:55.195
Listen up.

15:00.167 --> 15:03.136
Inspector Crabitz
of the park service

15:03.170 --> 15:05.272
decides who makes this team,

15:05.305 --> 15:09.242
but you bozos got to
get past me first.

15:09.977 --> 15:15.082
So for those of you who've been
wasting my time for seven years,

15:15.615 --> 15:17.650
it's a full-fledged tryout.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.120
Now...

15:20.353 --> 15:22.922
This season,
I'm very pleased to say

15:22.956 --> 15:25.558
that visiting us
from a foreign country

15:25.592 --> 15:28.461
is someone very special.

15:30.597 --> 15:34.267
This sweet young lady's
name is Tiana Chechornia.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.802
Uh, Czeckornia.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.270
Isn't that something?

15:37.304 --> 15:41.674
Now she is an exchange
patroller from Bratslavea.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.643
Bratislava.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.812
Shut up, Myron!

15:48.481 --> 15:51.051
She's here to study
our techniques.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.788
So don't make me look stupid.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.857
Is that clear to everybody?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.093
All right.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.428
Let's see what you got.

16:02.629 --> 16:03.863
- All right!
- All right.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.600
Okay, let's go.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.936
Meet you later, guys. Bye.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.704
Hey, Murray? What?

16:11.738 --> 16:13.973
Me and the boys got you a gift.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.409
Well, isn't it my lucky day?

16:21.381 --> 16:22.649
Oh, right, yeah. Ha, ha.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.284
Hey, Murray, we're just
trying to help, okay?

16:24.317 --> 16:25.952
We know you have a complex
about your height.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.655
I don't have a complex
about my height!

16:28.888 --> 16:30.823
The only thing complex
around here

16:30.857 --> 16:33.893
is how I'm gonna get you nitwits
through recertification!

16:33.926 --> 16:35.562
Get out of here.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.866
Wha... Oh, hey, look. Look.

16:40.933 --> 16:43.703
Does this... Does this
stuff really work?

16:43.736 --> 16:45.372
Murray, it works.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.384
All right, let's go!

17:15.935 --> 17:17.569
Okay, guys, pay attention.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.272
This is our 75mm
recoilless rifle.

17:21.441 --> 17:22.608
It's our avalanche buster.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.413
What do you people think
this is, a fiesta?

17:26.445 --> 17:28.581
There are too many
people up there.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.983
Now one of you, come on down.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.952
Ow!

17:37.457 --> 17:39.058
Come on, let's go.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.128
Oh, Stan, Stan.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.965
Stanley, son,

17:46.633 --> 17:50.203
I believe the same thing
happened last year, didn't it?

17:50.237 --> 17:52.472
Well, actually,
it was two years ago.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.775
Okay.

17:55.808 --> 17:59.946
Shooting the hole is the
toughest run on the mountain.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.782
Now I want y'all to be careful,

18:02.815 --> 18:06.253
but I want to see
some speed down there!

18:07.820 --> 18:09.021
Whoa.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.459
Sending down the first one.
Go for it.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.195
Nice job! Eddie, you're up.

18:16.263 --> 18:17.930
Here comes number two.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.333
Look, for some reason, I
just can't shoot the hole.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.402
Look, all you need
is confidence, Stanley.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.603
You can do it.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.172
Yeah, man, just relax.
Chill out.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.573
You see, shooting the hole

18:26.606 --> 18:28.675
is just like making love.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.144
I've never made love.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.445
Good luck.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.981
Here comes number three.
Go for it, man.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.849
See you at the bottom.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.356
Oh, God.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.225
Oh, God.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.330
Oh, no.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.733
Oh, my God!

18:55.868 --> 18:57.670
Oh! Oh, no!

19:00.640 --> 19:02.074
Oh, God!

19:05.378 --> 19:07.280
There goes his family life.

19:07.314 --> 19:10.149
Oh, oh! Oh, no!

19:12.819 --> 19:15.355
All right, everybody in!

19:18.358 --> 19:20.092
Martinez...

19:21.428 --> 19:22.762
Good work.

19:23.530 --> 19:24.731
Iceman...

19:24.764 --> 19:25.898
Thank you very much,
Mr. Tuttle.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.467
My mom is gonna appreciate
this very much.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.868
She's gonna love it.

19:28.901 --> 19:29.902
Thank you, sir. Good work.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.004
Oh, Lord, 911!

19:32.038 --> 19:33.706
911! Somebody
call the ambulance!

19:33.740 --> 19:37.109
Oh, that's funny. That's brilliant.
That's real funny.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.145
You know, Iceman,
I bet you're gonna win

19:39.178 --> 19:41.080
that Poolitzer Prize for humor.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.215
It's Pulitzer.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.783
Shut up, Myron.

19:47.454 --> 19:48.755
Where's Cramer?

19:48.788 --> 19:49.889
Murr?

19:49.922 --> 19:52.259
Don't sneak up on me, boy.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.228
Kind of like
a general, huh, Murr?

19:55.262 --> 19:57.930
Yeah, like a general
pain in the butt.

19:57.964 --> 20:02.735
Now, listen, Cramer, with seniority
comes something special.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.571
Oh, the R word? Yes, Cramer!

20:04.604 --> 20:08.608
The R word.
Responsibility, Cramer.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.511
Goes for all of you!
Responsibility.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.912
Now please don't let me down...

20:12.945 --> 20:13.980
Oh!

20:15.482 --> 20:16.816
What the...

20:22.221 --> 20:25.258
Murr, looks like
you made a new friend.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.364
Get that beast
out of here, Cramer.

20:31.398 --> 20:34.767
And I mean it! Or I'm... I'm gonna
turn on you like a mother-in-law.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.103
Here... Oh! Oh!
And another thing.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.940
Get these... These
vermin out of here.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.610
Cramer, this is against
health regulations.

20:43.643 --> 20:46.279
Catch my drift, son?
Get 'em out of here.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.281
All right, everybody out.

20:48.748 --> 20:49.949
Come on. Everybody out.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.059
What do you want?

21:00.092 --> 21:01.994
A gold pin. Did I pass?

21:02.295 --> 21:03.630
A gold pin?

21:04.464 --> 21:06.232
You want a gold pin, do you?

21:06.265 --> 21:09.268
Well, let me... Let me put
it this way, Stanley.

21:09.636 --> 21:12.639
Son, I hope you can shovel
better than you ski.

21:20.347 --> 21:22.081
I'm so sorry, Stanley.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.150
Oh, that... That's okay.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.686
Same thing happened last year.

21:26.719 --> 21:29.722
I guess I should be getting
used to it by now.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.992
I know how much you wanted
to be on the patrol.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.794
I wish you could be.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.797
Well, if they ever
start a shovel patrol,

21:37.830 --> 21:40.367
I'll definitely be
in charge of that.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.470
Thanks anyway, Tiana.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.777
* Girl stood on
the burning deck... *

21:53.846 --> 21:56.849
Who the hell is parked
in my spot?

22:03.155 --> 22:04.357
Oh, hi.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.960
The band and me were just
jamming for the talent show.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.397
Kind of loud, but loud's
best, right, man?

22:10.430 --> 22:12.231
Yeah, right, yeah.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.900
Look here, little mister,

22:13.933 --> 22:17.470
you get this oversized trash
compactor out of here

22:17.504 --> 22:19.506
or I'm gonna tear you...

22:19.539 --> 22:20.907
What'd that guy want?

22:20.940 --> 22:22.341
Well, he wants to come in.

22:22.375 --> 22:23.743
Let him in!

22:25.412 --> 22:26.679
They say come on in.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.481
Who? Them, the band.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.016
Who? They want to meet you.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.089
I don't know who you're...

22:31.117 --> 22:32.184
They're right over there.

22:32.218 --> 22:33.319
Who? Come on in.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.121
Oh, my Lord.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.294
Meet the band.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.431
This is Buried.

22:44.464 --> 22:47.734
If you want us to leave,
we will, kind sir.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.769
The guys call me Suicide.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.704
I play drums.

22:51.738 --> 22:54.607
And over here, the
wizard of the keyboards.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.576
This is Slaughter.

22:56.609 --> 22:58.711
You want trouble,
you got trouble!

22:58.745 --> 23:00.780
He likes you. No, I don't!

23:01.313 --> 23:03.483
He's a little temperamental.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.284
Would you like to hear
some of our music?

23:05.317 --> 23:07.119
No, thank you, that's...
Great! That's great.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.624
Shut it off!

23:13.059 --> 23:14.393
Shut it...

23:14.927 --> 23:16.128
...off.

23:17.296 --> 23:18.765
That's music, huh?

23:18.965 --> 23:21.167
And this is our inspiration.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.070
Rocket skis!

23:24.571 --> 23:26.439
Speed, thrills and fun!

23:27.474 --> 23:32.111
See, with these, we'll
taste death, live life.

23:32.344 --> 23:34.481
Hold on there a minute,
little buddy boy.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.749
You use rocket skis
on my slopes,

23:36.783 --> 23:39.185
and the only thing
you, you and you

23:39.418 --> 23:41.821
are gonna be tasting
is my foot in your face.

23:41.854 --> 23:42.989
Do you read me?

23:43.022 --> 23:44.757
Like a comic book.

23:44.791 --> 23:46.759
Like a biker magazine!

23:46.793 --> 23:48.795
Like Vogue.

23:52.031 --> 23:55.401
Son, did anybody ever tell you

23:55.434 --> 23:57.804
you're a few sandwiches
short of a picnic?

24:08.380 --> 24:09.820
Okay, great. You guys
are doing great.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.150
Brooke, keep
your edges in, okay?

24:11.183 --> 24:12.885
Your inside edges. Good.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.187
Cindy, you're awesome.

24:15.622 --> 24:16.989
Look at you!

24:27.800 --> 24:29.135
What do we think?

24:29.168 --> 24:31.270
I think I want to go home.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.706
You, candy ass,
we can't take you anywhere!

24:33.740 --> 24:35.842
Hey, come on, guys,
don't fight, all right?

24:35.875 --> 24:37.710
All right,
let's just go for it!

24:38.545 --> 24:39.879
Yeah.

24:48.487 --> 24:52.058
So what are we waiting for?
Let's shred this hill!

24:52.692 --> 24:57.530
He's right.
Taste death, live life!

25:00.933 --> 25:02.434
Yeah!

25:02.902 --> 25:05.004
Oh, no!

25:14.180 --> 25:16.683
Looks like someone
to play with.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.251
Then let's play hardball.

26:30.489 --> 26:32.558
Look out, no brakes!

26:41.000 --> 26:42.268
Excuse me!

26:42.301 --> 26:43.870
Out of the way!

26:48.340 --> 26:49.608
I love it!

26:49.642 --> 26:51.644
This is better than sex!

26:53.112 --> 26:54.146
Hey!

26:55.982 --> 26:58.284
What's that guy doing up
here with a snowboard?

26:58.450 --> 26:59.752
What's he doing with our sign?

26:59.786 --> 27:02.822
Then let's go nail the sucker!
Come on, man.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.792
Hey, guys, we crossed
the finish line first!

27:09.461 --> 27:11.430
Oh, no! Whoa!

27:21.407 --> 27:24.043
Hey, Ice, how about the
old clothes-line trick?

27:24.076 --> 27:25.477
Let's do it.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.649
I'm real!

27:31.050 --> 27:33.485
I think I wet my pants!

27:40.359 --> 27:42.028
Coming through!

27:43.562 --> 27:44.897
Whoa!

27:47.767 --> 27:49.535
Honey, you got anything
to cool this down?

27:49.568 --> 27:51.603
Oh, no!

27:56.508 --> 27:57.777
Thanks.

27:58.077 --> 28:01.247
That's great, you guys. You're
doing great. Keep it up.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.215
That's good.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.086
Hey, you're gonna
kill yourself!

28:07.119 --> 28:08.387
I am!

28:11.791 --> 28:13.125
You idiot!

28:13.559 --> 28:17.229
Sorry. This is my first time.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.288
Wait! What's that?

28:42.321 --> 28:43.389
What's what?

28:43.422 --> 28:47.093
That! That! It
looks like a rope!

28:49.996 --> 28:52.498
Damn, man, don't pull so hard.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.601
We're gonna eat it!

28:55.634 --> 28:57.336
No!

29:13.986 --> 29:16.422
I'm so sorry, Mr. Patrolman.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.424
Sorry, my ass!

29:19.125 --> 29:21.828
Taste death, live life.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.463
Let's get Larry, Moe
and Curly out of here.

29:24.496 --> 29:27.099
Yeah. All right, come on.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.169
Oh, thank you.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.437
Thanks.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.582
Hey. How are you?

29:43.615 --> 29:45.084
It's good to see you.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.886
It's good to see you again.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.991
All right, fellas, listen up.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.627
Remember, time is money.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.264
Keep those unprofitable
group lessons short

29:58.297 --> 30:00.666
and always be on the
lookout for ass grabbers.

30:00.699 --> 30:02.468
Ass grabbers, sir?

30:02.501 --> 30:03.970
Rich, middle-aged women.

30:04.003 --> 30:06.803
You grab their ass and they'll
practically beg you to take their money,

30:06.805 --> 30:07.874
among other things.

30:14.881 --> 30:16.515
Hi. How you doing?

30:17.649 --> 30:18.918
Hi, how are you?

30:24.823 --> 30:27.426
Right, left, right, left...

30:35.868 --> 30:37.436
- Stop!
- Hold it!

30:38.537 --> 30:40.272
Ready on the right?

30:41.773 --> 30:43.442
Ready on the left?

30:45.244 --> 30:46.512
Ice?

30:46.545 --> 30:48.080
All set, Jerry.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.019
Free for all!

31:09.969 --> 31:12.905
* Old man rhythm
standing in my shoes

31:13.105 --> 31:16.375
* No need sitting or
singing the blues

31:16.408 --> 31:17.676
* So be my guest.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.578
What the hell is that?

31:19.611 --> 31:22.414
* Won't you let me
take you on a sea cruise?

31:22.781 --> 31:24.116
* Ooh-ee

31:24.450 --> 31:26.953
* Ooh-ee, baby, ooh-ee

31:27.619 --> 31:29.255
* Ooh-ee, baby

31:29.288 --> 31:30.856
* Ooh-ee

31:30.889 --> 31:32.391
* Ooh-ee, baby

31:32.424 --> 31:35.461
* Won't you let me take
you on a sea cruise?

31:35.794 --> 31:39.765
* Feel like jumpin', baby,
won't you join me, please?

31:42.068 --> 31:48.007
* I don't mind begging but
now I'm on bended knees

31:48.640 --> 31:51.410
* I got to get the rocking,
get my hat off the rack.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.280
That was great!

31:55.114 --> 31:57.950
* Be my guest,
you got nothing to lose

31:58.184 --> 32:01.120
* Won't you let me take
you on a sea cruise?

32:01.153 --> 32:02.989
* Ooh-ee

32:03.022 --> 32:05.424
* Ooh-ee, baby, ooh-ee

32:05.457 --> 32:08.694
* Yeah, ooh-ee, baby, ooh-ee

32:09.428 --> 32:10.997
* Ooh-ee, baby

32:11.030 --> 32:13.932
* Won't you let me take
you on a sea cruise?

32:27.313 --> 32:30.249
* I gotta get to the rockin',
baby, I ain't lying

32:30.282 --> 32:33.419
* My heart is beating rhythm
and it's right on time

32:33.452 --> 32:36.455
* So be my guest,
you got nothing to lose

32:36.688 --> 32:39.491
* Won't you let me take
you on a sea cruise?

32:40.126 --> 32:41.593
* Ooh-ee

32:41.627 --> 32:44.130
* Ooh-ee, baby, ooh-ee

32:44.796 --> 32:46.698
* Ooh-ee, baby, ooh-ee.

32:46.732 --> 32:49.001
All right, boys, light 'em up.

32:49.568 --> 32:52.471
* Won't you let me take
you on a sea cruise?

33:02.414 --> 33:05.484
* Won't you let me take
you on a sea cruise? *

33:18.530 --> 33:23.001
Okay, time to put a little
tarnish on ski patrol's shine.

33:24.436 --> 33:26.438
Maris' plan, phase one.

34:04.776 --> 34:05.911
Hello.

34:05.944 --> 34:07.246
Thanks.

34:09.215 --> 34:12.217
Uh, excuse me, sir?
There's a $5 admission.

34:12.251 --> 34:15.254
Oh, I guess you don't know who I am.
I'm Sam Maris.

34:15.286 --> 34:16.888
Maris Realty and Home Loan.

34:16.922 --> 34:18.389
I'm usually comp-ed
at things like this.

34:18.424 --> 34:21.427
Yes, Mr. Maris, I know who you
are, but you still have to pay $5.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.529
Look, nothing goes on in this town
that I can't just walk right...

34:23.562 --> 34:24.795
What's the trouble, Ellen?

34:24.830 --> 34:28.634
Sandrich, would you please tell
this lady that I'm your guest?

34:29.467 --> 34:30.936
Make him pay.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.973
Don't worry,
it's tax-deductable.

34:37.243 --> 34:39.245
Thanks. Have a good time.

34:39.277 --> 34:40.779
No, thank you.

34:50.021 --> 34:51.257
Jeez.

34:55.327 --> 34:59.365
Hey, Stan, my man! Pull up a chair, dude.
Right, Myron?

34:59.665 --> 35:03.068
Oh, they said that this table's
only for ski patrollers.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.303
I didn't pass the test.

35:04.336 --> 35:05.771
Are you kidding?

35:05.804 --> 35:08.307
Any man who cleans up
after this squad

35:08.340 --> 35:10.642
deserves to be in this squad.

35:10.809 --> 35:13.645
Now sit down, homey,
with your bad coat on.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.481
Thanks.

35:18.150 --> 35:19.685
I'm glad you came.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.119
Thanks.

35:21.287 --> 35:24.122
Oh! Here, I brought
this for you.

35:24.890 --> 35:26.592
It kind of got squished, but...

35:26.625 --> 35:27.793
For me?

35:28.294 --> 35:29.995
Thank you, Stanley.

35:32.531 --> 35:34.300
Aw, gee.

35:36.535 --> 35:39.538
Can I have
your attention, please?

35:40.005 --> 35:42.674
Would you please help me
in giving a warm welcome

35:42.708 --> 35:44.976
to her honor, Mayor Biard?

35:55.587 --> 35:56.922
Thank you.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.157
Forty years ago,

35:59.191 --> 36:02.494
Pop Sandrich traded his
saddle for a pair of skis,

36:03.395 --> 36:05.864
and not only founded
this ski lodge,

36:05.897 --> 36:07.899
but our community as well.

36:07.933 --> 36:11.069
Pops, tonight is your night.

36:20.279 --> 36:23.249
Pops, for your 40 years of joy

36:23.449 --> 36:26.117
and caring and
community spirit,

36:26.585 --> 36:29.688
the whole town would like
to present you with...

36:35.861 --> 36:37.396
Oh, no. What...

36:47.306 --> 36:48.774
Hey! Hey, those are our mice.

36:48.807 --> 36:50.075
How'd they get here?

36:50.108 --> 36:52.010
Please don't step on 'em!
Let's just get 'em!

36:52.043 --> 36:54.112
I'm doing this
for the neighborhood.

37:17.503 --> 37:19.070
I got one.

37:23.309 --> 37:25.511
...40th anniversary and I...

37:26.945 --> 37:28.079
Edna.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.750
Inspector Crabitz
to you, Sandrich.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.387
Another one!

37:35.421 --> 37:38.757
Now you people know that mice
are against health regulations.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.258
Where the hell'd
they come from?

37:40.292 --> 37:41.427
We don't know.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.128
I do.

37:43.329 --> 37:44.863
They're pets.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.433
Of the ski patrol.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.835
Well, pets or no pets,

37:49.868 --> 37:52.304
I'm gonna have to
write you a citation.

37:52.338 --> 37:54.973
It's your first one
in years, Sandrich.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.109
Better make it your last.

38:03.349 --> 38:05.384
Well, strike one, gentlemen.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.553
Let's make it a quick inning.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.124
Oh, no!

38:17.463 --> 38:18.530
Can I help you, ma'am?

38:18.564 --> 38:20.799
Yes, I lost my contact lens.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.303
Your contact? Where?

38:26.304 --> 38:28.006
Somewhere on this mountain.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.741
Can you help me find it?

38:31.643 --> 38:32.744
Yeah.

38:34.813 --> 38:35.947
Where are we going?

38:35.981 --> 38:38.617
Murray wants the main trails
checked for obstacles.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.619
Okay. I'll go down
Badger's Pass.

38:40.652 --> 38:41.953
Okay, I'll take Turner's.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.489
All right.

38:56.101 --> 38:58.236
Guys, can you help me
find my contact lens?

39:00.005 --> 39:02.040
- You bet!
- Yeah, sure, no problem.

39:06.244 --> 39:08.714
Uh, Jerr? Jerry?
Do you read me?

39:08.914 --> 39:10.449
Jerry, come in!

39:11.282 --> 39:13.519
What's up? Eddie?

39:15.020 --> 39:16.054
Hello?

39:16.087 --> 39:17.689
I got a little problem here.

39:18.390 --> 39:21.059
Oh, whoa, whoa!

39:28.366 --> 39:30.235
- He almost killed us!
- This is crazy!

39:30.268 --> 39:31.637
Really!

39:33.405 --> 39:35.206
Come check this out! Hurry up.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.876
Uh, Jerr? Make that
a big problem.

39:43.114 --> 39:44.483
Keep digging.

39:47.553 --> 39:50.288
Hey, did anybody
lose a contact lens?

39:57.295 --> 40:00.098
This bothers me, Eddie. These
machines were overhauled last week.

40:00.131 --> 40:01.600
How could something
like this happen?

40:01.633 --> 40:03.969
I don't know, Jerr. All I know
is it was fine yesterday.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.471
Yeah.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.373
Eddie, for God's sakes,
you all right?

40:08.406 --> 40:11.076
Yeah, thanks, Pop. But I
think this puppy's history.

40:11.109 --> 40:13.745
Jerry, my God, this
really is a mess.

40:13.779 --> 40:14.813
Yeah, it is.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.949
A bigger mess
than you think, Sandrich.

40:18.584 --> 40:21.620
Edna. Well, uh...

40:22.988 --> 40:26.592
This is unfortunate.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.126
What's unfortunate

40:28.159 --> 40:33.131
is that Snowy Peaks now has two
major violations against it.

40:36.468 --> 40:39.137
A lousy way to
start a season, Sandrich.

40:42.307 --> 40:46.311
And a patrol that can't
keep a mountain safe

40:47.012 --> 40:49.347
ain't gonna be
a patrol anymore.

40:49.380 --> 40:50.682
Wait a second, Edna.

40:50.716 --> 40:53.184
These boys are good boys. They've
never let me down before.

40:53.218 --> 40:57.055
Look, I'm warning you people,
any more of this crap,

40:57.388 --> 41:00.025
and I'm gonna close
this mountain down.

41:00.391 --> 41:04.062
Edna, we have an impeccable
safety record here.

41:04.563 --> 41:06.164
I'll vouch for these kids.

41:06.197 --> 41:07.966
They... Now, listen!

41:07.999 --> 41:10.268
They are some of the best
patrollers in the state, Edna.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.470
Would you please
take this back?

41:12.504 --> 41:14.540
So, hotshot!

41:15.073 --> 41:18.043
This season's barely begun
and you've already blown it.

41:18.076 --> 41:19.144
Well, I...

41:19.177 --> 41:20.812
No! No! You listen to me.

41:20.846 --> 41:24.182
You shape up or I will baste
you like a Butterball.

41:24.215 --> 41:27.318
And don't you think I can't do it, boy.
Shape up!

41:29.154 --> 41:31.422
What the hell did I trip...

41:51.342 --> 41:53.511
* All night long

41:53.779 --> 41:56.381
* From midnight on

41:56.414 --> 41:59.150
* Took my girl
to church last night

41:59.184 --> 42:01.753
* Let me tell you
what she went and done

42:02.220 --> 42:05.190
* She stood right up
in the preacher's face

42:05.223 --> 42:08.193
* And she chewed her
chewing gum all night... *

42:25.977 --> 42:27.478
Wait a minute.

42:28.780 --> 42:30.616
Wait a minute.

42:31.617 --> 42:34.886
Wait just a goldarn minute.

42:45.296 --> 42:47.132
Well, slap me silly.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.936
This stuff's really working.

42:51.269 --> 42:53.471
Ooh, better not overdo it!

42:53.504 --> 42:55.641
It's... It's really working.

42:56.141 --> 42:59.310
I can't believe it.
It's really, really working!

42:59.510 --> 43:03.281
No more "short stuff!"
No more "Mr. Little-Big!"

43:03.514 --> 43:04.750
Here I come.

43:20.999 --> 43:22.634
Hello, darlings.

43:23.802 --> 43:25.804
Iceman, Cramer!

43:26.471 --> 43:29.107
Plunk my tired,
weary ass right here.

43:29.140 --> 43:30.475
Go for it, Murr.

43:32.811 --> 43:35.881
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa,
Murray, slow down. Okay?

43:36.214 --> 43:37.683
You got to know
when to say when.

43:37.716 --> 43:41.119
Shut up. This stuff makes
me sleep like a baby.

43:41.152 --> 43:44.622
Besides, I wanna tell you
boys a little secret.

43:46.024 --> 43:50.295
Because of those pills
that Martinez gave me,

43:51.296 --> 43:54.866
I've grown three inches
in the last two days.

43:55.801 --> 43:58.336
Oh? Go on!

43:58.704 --> 44:00.471
I ain't shitting you!

44:00.505 --> 44:02.040
I wouldn't have
believed it myself

44:02.073 --> 44:03.608
if I hadn't seen it
with my own eyes.

44:03.641 --> 44:07.545
Hey, listen, I can't
fit in my own car.

44:08.479 --> 44:11.482
Good. 'Cause you see, drinking
and driving do not mix,

44:11.516 --> 44:13.685
that's why
I'm driving you home.

44:13.719 --> 44:15.386
Not yet, you ain't.

44:15.420 --> 44:17.155
I'm gonna find me
a big, tall redhead.

44:17.188 --> 44:19.825
I'm gonna get out on that
floor and cut the rug.

44:19.858 --> 44:23.028
Murr, look, alcohol
and growth pills

44:23.061 --> 44:26.865
can cause weird and
strange things to happen.

44:27.232 --> 44:32.037
Well, it so happens that
tall people such as myself,

44:32.437 --> 44:33.839
can handle...

44:36.274 --> 44:37.608
Liquor.

44:43.214 --> 44:45.616
I saw this shit
in The Exorcist.

44:48.686 --> 44:49.755
Stanley.

44:49.788 --> 44:51.456
Oh, hi!

44:51.957 --> 44:54.592
Hi. I tried to call you
but you have no phone.

44:54.625 --> 44:57.095
Oh, I don't need one.
Who'd want to call me?

44:57.128 --> 45:00.031
I would. You're very special.

45:00.065 --> 45:03.234
To you, I can talk. Most American
men interested only in sex.

45:03.268 --> 45:06.104
Sex! Oh, I'm not
interested in that.

45:06.137 --> 45:08.039
Well, I mean, I am,
but I wouldn't...

45:08.073 --> 45:10.776
Well, I would, but, you know, I don't.
Well, I...

45:10.809 --> 45:12.744
Would you like to dance?

45:12.944 --> 45:14.545
Dance? Uh, no.

45:15.613 --> 45:16.882
Do you know how?

45:16.915 --> 45:19.384
Oh, sure. No, really, I do.

45:19.918 --> 45:21.086
Let's dance.

45:21.119 --> 45:22.453
Oh, uh...

45:22.754 --> 45:25.090
Come on. Stanley!

46:33.992 --> 46:35.526
Okay, Stanley!

47:54.973 --> 47:56.541
That's my boy, Stan!

48:19.497 --> 48:21.366
Do you always carry
champagne with you?

48:21.399 --> 48:23.534
Well, class is my middle name.

48:23.568 --> 48:25.971
I think I'm gonna
let this breathe.

48:31.309 --> 48:33.344
Jerry, pour the champagne.

48:34.345 --> 48:36.847
Ellen, you know
I'm crazy about you.

48:38.283 --> 48:40.685
Honestly,
what do you think of me?

48:41.486 --> 48:45.056
I think you're an immature,
wisecracking ski bum.

48:45.090 --> 48:47.125
Oh, no, don't sugarcoat it.

48:49.627 --> 48:52.163
Actually, you're
pretty irresistible.

48:52.197 --> 48:55.933
But you should settle down, start
thinking about the future.

49:01.272 --> 49:02.607
Jerry, what are you doing?

49:02.640 --> 49:04.642
Thinking about the future.

49:05.643 --> 49:07.778
I think we should go skiing.

49:17.688 --> 49:19.190
Jerry, what happened?

49:19.224 --> 49:20.625
Jerry? What...

49:23.228 --> 49:24.329
You!

49:48.186 --> 49:49.420
Holy shit.

50:01.032 --> 50:02.367
Holy shit!

50:05.403 --> 50:07.405
I overdid it.

50:08.439 --> 50:12.009
I took too many of these pills.

50:17.115 --> 50:19.184
I'm a frigging giant!

50:21.186 --> 50:22.453
Huh?

50:34.265 --> 50:36.867
You bastards!

50:37.768 --> 50:41.406
I'm gonna get you, Cramer!
I'm gonna get you!

50:59.257 --> 51:01.992
Now that's what I call
dangerous curves.

51:02.460 --> 51:05.363
Terrific! All right.

51:05.396 --> 51:07.898
Excellent.
Brenda, you're beautiful.

51:08.666 --> 51:11.001
Okay. Nice angle.

51:12.403 --> 51:14.805
Keep stepping into it.
Beautiful!

51:17.575 --> 51:20.578
Oh, that's it. Yeah!

51:21.746 --> 51:24.582
Nice. Yeah.
Throw your hair back.

51:25.816 --> 51:27.618
All right. Beautiful.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.921
Excellent. Oh, great.

51:30.955 --> 51:32.323
Got to have it.

51:37.295 --> 51:38.363
Yeah.

51:41.132 --> 51:43.268
That was terrific,
girls. Thank you.

51:43.301 --> 51:47.004
Now all we've got to do is take
those Snowy Peaks promo shots

51:47.037 --> 51:49.507
we promised Mr. Maris
and we'll be done.

51:49.540 --> 51:50.775
Who's Maris?

51:50.808 --> 51:52.810
Excuse me. Coming through.

51:56.514 --> 51:58.583
Look at this. This is wonderful.
Looking good.

51:58.616 --> 51:59.984
Thanks for coming.
How you doing?

52:00.017 --> 52:02.153
Good. Just grab a girl up there.
Thanks for coming.

52:08.659 --> 52:11.329
I love it. Let's do it.

52:11.362 --> 52:13.130
Maybe we shouldn't.

52:13.164 --> 52:15.700
Maybe you're right.

52:16.701 --> 52:18.736
Just do it!

52:19.069 --> 52:20.571
Okay. Okay.

52:29.314 --> 52:31.882
We need another guy to even this out.
Here, take this.

52:32.350 --> 52:35.386
Have we got somebody over here
that can even this line out?

52:35.420 --> 52:37.021
Yo, man, you see
this guy right here?

52:37.054 --> 52:38.956
This here is the head honcho...

52:38.989 --> 52:40.525
No, this guy... Of ski patrol.

52:40.558 --> 52:41.626
Great. Come on over.

52:41.659 --> 52:43.194
Here's your man! Go!
Get over there, man.

52:43.228 --> 52:45.095
Go on, man. Heard that. Yeah.

52:46.731 --> 52:48.466
Thank you. Head honcho, huh?

52:48.499 --> 52:50.668
All right. Right in the center.
Grab a girl.

52:56.674 --> 52:58.343
How do you steer this thing?

52:58.376 --> 53:00.077
Who cares? Go faster!

53:00.110 --> 53:01.912
I'm going, I'm going.

53:07.184 --> 53:08.953
I love it!

53:38.449 --> 53:41.118
Okay, you guys are doing so good.
I'm so proud.

53:41.151 --> 53:43.621
Especially you now, Nancy. I want
you to keep your arms up, okay?

53:43.654 --> 53:45.974
And keep your head up and look
over my shoulder, all right?

53:50.961 --> 53:52.530
Damn that guy.

53:52.563 --> 53:55.132
Sheila, wait right here.
I'll be right back, okay?

54:04.842 --> 54:06.243
Hey, idiot!

54:07.445 --> 54:08.779
You're being paged.

54:08.813 --> 54:10.381
I'm no idiot!

54:10.415 --> 54:13.318
Stop this thing
before you kill somebody!

54:16.787 --> 54:18.756
I'm hooked up on your binding.
Will you stop?

54:18.789 --> 54:20.525
I'm caught. I'm caught!

54:24.629 --> 54:26.196
Stop this thing, damn it!

54:29.367 --> 54:32.903
Code blue! Slope 10. It's Ellen
attached to runaway ski sailor!

54:32.937 --> 54:35.005
Can you hear me? It's Ellen.

54:37.708 --> 54:38.876
Ellen.

54:48.118 --> 54:49.153
Damn.

55:37.835 --> 55:39.336
Is that better, dear?

55:39.370 --> 55:40.971
Oh, yes, much better.

55:44.775 --> 55:46.176
Oh, much better!

56:07.364 --> 56:09.400
What are you doing?

56:09.434 --> 56:11.436
Hey, ladies, how you doing?

56:15.440 --> 56:17.742
Well, nice chatting with you.

56:17.775 --> 56:21.078
And remember, I'm a professional.
Don't try this at home.

56:36.326 --> 56:39.630
Station 4-A. Stand by
with an M-40. Stat!

57:17.968 --> 57:20.004
Jerry! Jerry, help!

57:20.538 --> 57:22.306
Hold on! I'm coming!

57:33.784 --> 57:35.219
Jerry!

57:46.864 --> 57:48.733
Jerry! Hurry up, Jerry!

58:16.093 --> 58:17.427
Oh, Jerry.

58:18.696 --> 58:21.599
You okay? Don't
ever do that again.

58:24.602 --> 58:29.239
Whoa! Who was that masked man?
I wanted to thank him.

58:38.448 --> 58:42.419
Gentlemen, the safety
portion of Crabitz's test.

58:42.452 --> 58:43.654
Oh, correction.

58:43.688 --> 58:46.523
An advanced copy of the safety
portion of Crabitz's test.

58:47.692 --> 58:48.759
How'd you get this?

58:48.793 --> 58:51.896
Um, little wallet-sized
pictures of presidents.

58:53.631 --> 58:56.066
With that plus what
you guys are gonna do

58:56.100 --> 58:57.534
to the ski patrol's equipment,

58:57.568 --> 58:59.937
there's no way
they're gonna pass.

59:02.106 --> 59:05.743
This time tomorrow, Pops Sandrich
will be ancient history.

59:05.776 --> 59:07.778
And Maristown will be born.

59:08.979 --> 59:11.248
And I'll be the proud new papa.

59:13.651 --> 59:17.087
Yeah, well, I just thought of another
idea of ensuring our little bet.

59:17.121 --> 59:18.288
Come on.

59:25.663 --> 59:27.164
How you doing?

59:29.734 --> 59:31.268
Ho, I'll tell you, kid,

59:31.301 --> 59:35.105
this is some place to come shopping
with your mom, understand?

59:47.652 --> 59:48.753
Hey.

59:50.487 --> 59:51.521
Hi.

01:00:02.299 --> 01:00:03.968
Hey, hey, this stuff.

01:00:04.001 --> 01:00:05.135
Perfect.

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:10.607
Oh, hey, Martinez,
what's going on?

01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:13.811
Yo, Finkmeyer, what brings
you to a hardware store?

01:00:14.011 --> 01:00:17.214
Let me guess. Looking
for a snap-on tool?

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:21.451
Look, Edward,

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.421
I know there's been
a lot of bad blood

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:27.257
between the ski patrol
and the ski school,

01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:29.493
but I really think it's
time to bury the hatchet

01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:31.729
and put it all behind us, huh?

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:35.232
Adios, amigo.

01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:42.306
Excuse me, Mr. Philips?

01:00:42.339 --> 01:00:43.841
Hi.

01:00:43.874 --> 01:00:45.976
I hate being
the bearer of bad news,

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:48.112
but that ethnic fellow
over there,

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:51.115
he's pulling a Frito
Bandito number on you.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:54.551
You go check his pockets,
we'll get the police.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:02.159
Eddie Martinez in jail?

01:01:02.192 --> 01:01:03.560
Martinez? I don't believe it.

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:04.995
Why would he steal?

01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:07.909
I don't know, but there must be something
we can do. Now you've got to...

01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:09.499
Right.

01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:11.435
Okay.

01:01:13.103 --> 01:01:14.805
They won't budge on the bail.

01:01:14.839 --> 01:01:17.674
Shoplifting?
I don't believe it.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.844
We gotta get him out of there.

01:01:19.877 --> 01:01:21.511
If you guys don't pass
this inspection tomorrow,

01:01:21.545 --> 01:01:23.680
Pops is gonna
lose the mountain.

01:01:23.714 --> 01:01:25.682
We can't let that
happen to him.

01:01:25.716 --> 01:01:27.651
And Eddie's got to set off those
explosives tomorrow and...

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.253
Yeah, I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear it.

01:01:29.286 --> 01:01:30.888
How much money do we have?

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:33.557
$412.

01:01:34.091 --> 01:01:37.461
There are 25 ski patrollers
and all we have is $412?

01:01:38.295 --> 01:01:40.297
Oh, that's just beautiful.

01:01:44.101 --> 01:01:47.772
Well, I guess I can hock
my singing machine.

01:01:48.939 --> 01:01:50.440
Wait a minute.

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:53.443
Yeah, this is it. Hold on.

01:01:54.144 --> 01:01:56.413
Yeah, guys, come here.
This is it!

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:58.248
Yeah! Check it out.

01:01:59.616 --> 01:02:02.452
"Mountain High Bar
talent contest."

01:02:02.753 --> 01:02:06.290
"Winner take all, $1,000."

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:10.227
Give me this thing. $1,000?

01:02:10.928 --> 01:02:12.596
I can do that.

01:02:12.629 --> 01:02:15.299
I can do... Man, I can knock
this town on its butt.

01:02:15.332 --> 01:02:17.434
Wait, wait, wait,
you guys, hold it.

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:19.569
We can't just walk in
there with this machine.

01:02:19.603 --> 01:02:21.738
We gotta do something
different here.

01:02:21.772 --> 01:02:23.573
Yeah, but I got it.

01:02:23.607 --> 01:02:26.811
The Iceman has got it.

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:28.913
How about

01:02:28.946 --> 01:02:33.750
a singing-and-dancing-
choreographed-rip-you-up, ow, duet?

01:02:34.118 --> 01:02:37.087
Duet? You're the only
good singer we've got.

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:39.957
You see, with this machine

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:41.926
I can prerecord
the other parts,

01:02:41.959 --> 01:02:44.761
make it sound any way
the Iceman wants.

01:02:44.795 --> 01:02:48.332
All we need is
a kick-ass dancer.

01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:52.169
Oh, no!

01:02:52.202 --> 01:02:55.105
Oh, yeah.
You can kick some ass.

01:02:55.139 --> 01:02:58.175
First time I saw you I said,
"He be kicking some ass."

01:02:58.208 --> 01:02:59.776
No, I wasn't kicking
anyone's... No.

01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:03.113
* I had to give you up

01:03:03.147 --> 01:03:07.084
* But you didn't make it easy

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:12.322
* And even though
I tried to stay away

01:03:12.356 --> 01:03:17.828
* I will always

01:03:18.362 --> 01:03:23.067
* Love you.

01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:33.043
Thank you.

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:38.482
Michelle Rohl, ladies and
gentlemen, with the score to beat.

01:03:40.918 --> 01:03:42.052
For the next act,

01:03:42.086 --> 01:03:45.055
could you plug the output of
this machine into your PA?

01:03:45.089 --> 01:03:46.423
Yeah, sure.

01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:49.726
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
we have a last-minute entry,

01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:51.728
one you'll have
to see to believe.

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:55.866
From our local ski patrol,
Stanley and the Iceman.

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.101
All right!

01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:08.545
* Calling out around the world

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:11.448
* Are you ready
for a brand-new beat?

01:04:12.616 --> 01:04:16.020
* Summer's here
and all is right

01:04:16.053 --> 01:04:18.188
* For dancing in the street

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:20.324
* Dancing in Chicago

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:21.858

sweet music

01:04:33.938 --> 01:04:37.407
* There'll be music everywhere

01:04:37.441 --> 01:04:39.709
* They'll be swinging, swaying

01:04:39.743 --> 01:04:41.545
* And records playing

01:04:41.578 --> 01:04:43.780
* And dancing in the street

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:48.285
* It doesn't matter
what you wear

01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:51.521
* Just as long as you are there

01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:52.689
* So come on

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:56.260

01:04:59.463 --> 01:05:00.530

01:06:41.265 --> 01:06:45.235
Ladies and gentlemen, I
believe we have our winners.

01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:47.504
Stanley and the Iceman!

01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:54.778
Yes! All right, we did it!

01:07:07.624 --> 01:07:09.259
Party! Hey, party!

01:07:09.293 --> 01:07:12.929
Ice, Ice, I need the money, man,
to spring Eddie out of jail.

01:07:12.962 --> 01:07:14.264
Yeah, all right, man.
Go ahead, do it. Do it.

01:07:14.298 --> 01:07:15.565
See you later.

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:17.067
Hey, Ice, wait up.

01:07:17.101 --> 01:07:18.368
Stanley.

01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:21.605
I have never met
anyone like you.

01:07:22.606 --> 01:07:23.907
I'll bet.

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:25.909
I've been wanting to do
something for a long time

01:07:25.942 --> 01:07:27.944
but I needed your permission.

01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:29.279
Go ahead.

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:47.030
The lodge has passed
every other test.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.565
Now it's up to you people.

01:07:48.598 --> 01:07:50.100
Hey, don't worry, Pops.
It's in the bag.

01:07:50.134 --> 01:07:51.735
Yeah, we got you covered, Pops.

01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:52.936
Okay, let's move it.

01:07:52.969 --> 01:07:56.906
Hey, hey, Cramer! I think that's my job.
I'm the director.

01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:57.941
Okay.

01:07:57.974 --> 01:07:59.343
Let's move!

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:55.365
Well, that's the last of 'em.

01:09:01.004 --> 01:09:03.540
- Prefire safety check.
- Aiming mechanism.

01:09:03.573 --> 01:09:04.974
Check. Clear in front?

01:09:05.008 --> 01:09:06.443
Clear in front.
Clear in the rear?

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:08.245
Clear in the rear. Clear!

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:14.117
Uh-oh.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.585
"Uh-oh" what?

01:09:21.425 --> 01:09:23.260
Oh, no!

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:32.536
Man, it don't make sense. The
sight was fine an hour ago.

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:34.770
Now it's 50 degrees off.

01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:41.310
I don't know what to say.

01:09:41.345 --> 01:09:42.879
Try "goodbye."

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:47.183
Because as of 5:00 today,
this mountain is closed.

01:10:01.064 --> 01:10:04.067
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
everybody,

01:10:04.768 --> 01:10:07.437
may I have your
attention for a moment?

01:10:11.074 --> 01:10:14.978
No cowboy can stay
on a bronc forever.

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:19.883
And 40 years
is a good long ride.

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:24.087
What I'm trying to say is.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.556
Snowy Peaks has lost its lease.

01:10:27.791 --> 01:10:31.628
And the park officials have
revoked your patrol licenses.

01:10:34.464 --> 01:10:37.000
And for the good of the valley,

01:10:38.335 --> 01:10:40.003
I've decided to

01:10:42.772 --> 01:10:45.174
sell to Sam Maris.

01:10:46.843 --> 01:10:50.747
I love you all. I know
how hard you've tried,

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:54.784
but we just came up a day late

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.087
and a dollar short.

01:11:03.159 --> 01:11:06.796
I know this is as much a
shock to you as it is to me,

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:09.399
so take your time cleaning
out your belongings.

01:11:09.433 --> 01:11:11.801
You got half an hour
to get off the mountain.

01:11:13.036 --> 01:11:14.438
Move. Move.

01:11:20.677 --> 01:11:22.245
Don't worry about it, man.
It'll be all right.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:24.047
Just chill out, okay?

01:11:25.815 --> 01:11:27.183
Need a suitcase, Cramer?

01:11:28.318 --> 01:11:30.687
Lance, just lay off.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.557
It's a little early
for vultures, isn't it?

01:11:34.824 --> 01:11:37.994
This one wanted to pick
while the meat was fresh.

01:11:38.528 --> 01:11:39.763
Hey, come on! Come on.

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:41.465
Anytime, Cramer.

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:44.601
It's all right, man.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:47.203
I'm really sorry
about this, boys.

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:50.306
But you're all good patrollers

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.276
and you'll find a new lodge.

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:55.679
New lodges, but not new homes.

01:11:58.482 --> 01:12:01.851
Pops, don't you see someone
pulled a fast one on us?

01:12:01.885 --> 01:12:03.319
What are you saying, son?

01:12:03.353 --> 01:12:05.154
We've been sabotaged!

01:12:05.188 --> 01:12:08.124
Someone went to a hell of a lot
of trouble to make sure we'd fail

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:10.460
and kick us out of here.

01:12:10.494 --> 01:12:12.396
Yeah, but who'd do that?

01:12:12.429 --> 01:12:13.997
Hey, guys, come here. Check this out.
Come here.

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:15.532
Come here, look at this.

01:12:15.565 --> 01:12:16.966
Check it out over here.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.339
He did take the duty roster
from the locker room.

01:12:23.373 --> 01:12:25.709
Yeah, somebody moved
the Howitzer sight,

01:12:25.742 --> 01:12:27.844
screwed up all our machines.

01:12:29.779 --> 01:12:30.914
Pops?

01:12:33.116 --> 01:12:35.852
I don't think, I know.

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:37.954
I just don't know
how to prove it.

01:12:40.557 --> 01:12:43.627
I'm gonna have a little
talk with Mr. Maris.

01:12:49.633 --> 01:12:52.068
Maris, we've got to talk.

01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:55.071
It's about how you
sabotaged this mountain.

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:56.406
I sabotaged this mountain?

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.107
You're out of
your mind, old man.

01:13:03.112 --> 01:13:05.281
Taste death, live life!

01:13:05.314 --> 01:13:06.883
Maybe we shouldn't.

01:13:06.916 --> 01:13:09.786
Shut up, geek! It's showtime!

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:52.696
Holy shit!

01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:59.469
This is an $800 jacket.

01:13:59.803 --> 01:14:01.838
You still own this mountain,
you're gonna pay for it.

01:14:01.871 --> 01:14:04.440
You got any napkins
in this dump?

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:10.313
Back away, Maris!

01:14:10.346 --> 01:14:11.948
Back away! This
thing's ready to go!

01:14:11.981 --> 01:14:13.717
Get out! I can't!

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:17.687
Oh, please stop! Hey,
get me out of here!

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:22.826
I'm stuck on a goddamned
runaway weenie! Hey!

01:14:22.859 --> 01:14:24.293
Let's do it!

01:14:24.327 --> 01:14:25.795
Somebody do something!

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.799
Get me loose! Please!

01:14:29.833 --> 01:14:31.100
Somebody!

01:14:31.134 --> 01:14:34.037
Hey, Pops, hop on
and hold on tight.

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:36.305
We about to do our thing!

01:14:36.906 --> 01:14:38.174
Let's go!

01:14:53.022 --> 01:14:54.824
Somebody get me out of here!

01:14:54.858 --> 01:14:57.060
Hey, please,
get me out of here!

01:14:57.093 --> 01:14:59.796
But I want a hot dog.
I want a hot dog!

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:02.465
You're not gonna get one. They
don't even have hot dogs here.

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:05.501
Hey! Stop this thing,
somebody! Anybody!

01:15:05.535 --> 01:15:07.904
I'm a very important
person, you hear me?

01:15:07.937 --> 01:15:09.338
Stop it!

01:15:14.077 --> 01:15:17.581
Hey! Hey, somebody
get me out of here!

01:15:17.614 --> 01:15:18.915
Hey! Hey!

01:15:28.224 --> 01:15:29.458
Help!

01:15:29.492 --> 01:15:33.763
Wait a minute. Wait.
Wait. Tiana, stop, stop.

01:15:34.097 --> 01:15:37.967
- Can you hear me?
- I'm stuck!

01:15:38.301 --> 01:15:40.103
Tiana, come here.
I'm stuck down here.

01:15:40.136 --> 01:15:41.771
Help!

01:15:42.706 --> 01:15:45.408
Somebody's got to help me!

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:47.543
Murray.

01:15:49.913 --> 01:15:54.083
Help! Somebody help me, please!

01:15:54.117 --> 01:15:56.285
Anybody up there?

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:03.192
Hey, get me up from here!

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:07.096
Quiet. Loud noise can
cause an avalanche.

01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:09.465
Then, hurry up.

01:16:09.498 --> 01:16:10.934
I'm going to traverse down.

01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:13.670
Wait, wait, we don't
have the proper rig.

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:17.273
I have an idea.

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:46.035
Help.

01:16:48.204 --> 01:16:49.305
Help.

01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:57.814
Eddie, tie this on.

01:16:59.215 --> 01:17:00.850
Ice, give me your lifeline.

01:17:00.884 --> 01:17:02.251
No, man, I'll do it.

01:17:02.285 --> 01:17:03.687
No, no, no, no.

01:17:05.655 --> 01:17:06.756
I'll do it.

01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:07.924
Pops, no, you're not.

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:09.292
You sure you can handle it?

01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:12.628
You bet your ass I can handle it.
Give me that rope.

01:17:21.871 --> 01:17:23.272
Hiya, Sam!

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:26.542
Don't "Hi, Sam" me!
Just throw me the rope.

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:28.644
Hey, I'd like to tell
you a little story.

01:17:28.678 --> 01:17:30.446
It'll help you relax.

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:32.782
The story's about how
a heartless land developer

01:17:32.816 --> 01:17:35.118
and his three
ski-school lackeys...

01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:37.787
They... Oh, hell.

01:17:37.821 --> 01:17:39.923
You already know this story.

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:42.225
You wrote it.

01:17:43.326 --> 01:17:44.560
You can't prove a thing.

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:46.129
Don't have to.

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:48.064
You're gonna blow
your own whistle

01:17:48.097 --> 01:17:51.167
or ride this hot dog
down the express route.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.970
You've lost your mind, old man.

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:55.471
No.

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:57.240
Just my lodge.

01:17:57.273 --> 01:17:59.608
I ain't got
nothing else to lose.

01:18:00.343 --> 01:18:01.510
Oh, my God!

01:18:04.247 --> 01:18:05.949
All right, listen!

01:18:06.449 --> 01:18:09.753
The violations, the testing,

01:18:09.786 --> 01:18:12.688
the Howitzer, everything,
it was all...

01:18:13.389 --> 01:18:15.792
It was all my fault.

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:21.064
Ski patrol's not to blame.

01:18:22.265 --> 01:18:24.467
Okay, here's the rope!

01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:28.671
Thank you.

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:30.173
Thank you.

01:18:47.123 --> 01:18:49.092
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

01:18:49.125 --> 01:18:51.594
Thank you very much.
Oh, God bless you.

01:18:51.627 --> 01:18:54.730
Maris, this is as close as you'll
ever come to being a hot dog.

01:18:56.933 --> 01:19:00.703
Oh, hey, Pops, see you
on the slopes tomorrow?

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:02.939
You bet. We'll be there.

01:19:04.774 --> 01:19:06.642
Ooh, yeah! I like that, man.
All right.

01:19:08.978 --> 01:19:10.947
What are they doing?

01:19:11.848 --> 01:19:13.716
What are they doing?

01:19:25.328 --> 01:19:27.263
Come here, doggie.

01:19:27.964 --> 01:19:29.498
Come here.

01:19:29.532 --> 01:19:30.599
How's Dumpster doing?

01:19:30.633 --> 01:19:31.968
Okay so far.

01:19:32.001 --> 01:19:34.804
Sweet baby puppy,
come here to Daddy.

01:19:34.838 --> 01:19:37.140
Come here to Daddy. Yes.

01:19:37.173 --> 01:19:40.810
Oh, yes. Yes, yes. Yes.

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:43.612
Murray, how are you doing?

01:19:43.947 --> 01:19:45.181
I've just about got it.

01:19:47.216 --> 01:19:49.685
Oh, no. Oh, no!

01:19:53.356 --> 01:19:54.824
Don't sneeze!

01:19:55.992 --> 01:19:57.994
Oh, no!

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:02.765
Oh, Lord!

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:05.334
Oh, Lord, help me! Oh!

01:20:08.204 --> 01:20:09.272
Pull!

01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:12.441
Pull!

01:20:12.475 --> 01:20:15.811
Oh! Ow! Oh, pull! Yeah.

01:20:15.845 --> 01:20:19.582
Here we go,
here we go! Oh, pull!

01:20:20.049 --> 01:20:22.151
It's okay!

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:29.859
Hey, guys, look!

01:20:31.727 --> 01:20:33.562
Oh, man, they're getting away!
Let's go!

01:20:33.596 --> 01:20:35.264
Let's get 'em!

01:20:38.902 --> 01:20:40.970
Ice, throw me a rope.

01:20:41.004 --> 01:20:42.071
Ice, what's that?

01:20:42.105 --> 01:20:43.973
Thera-Band, man. It's
the only thing we got.

01:20:44.007 --> 01:20:45.508
Here, catch!

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:52.681
Just be careful, will you?

01:20:59.956 --> 01:21:02.558
You guys keep going.
Don't stop!

01:21:06.095 --> 01:21:08.364
Go faster! Faster!

01:21:13.402 --> 01:21:15.138
Ice, cut me loose.

01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:49.605
Oh, shit!

01:22:05.955 --> 01:22:07.323
Look out!

01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:15.999
Check this, Cramer!

01:22:16.499 --> 01:22:18.167
Give it up, Finkmeyer!

01:22:21.137 --> 01:22:22.838
Get off this mountain!

01:22:22.871 --> 01:22:24.974
Never, Cramer.

01:22:25.008 --> 01:22:26.342
Bonehead!

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:42.125
Limbo!

01:22:46.495 --> 01:22:48.497
See you later, Cramer!

01:22:58.241 --> 01:23:01.010
Let go of me! Let go of me!

01:24:43.846 --> 01:24:45.248
- ...with your bad self.
- Iceman?

01:24:45.281 --> 01:24:46.282
Yo?

01:24:46.315 --> 01:24:47.650
He looks like a
patroller, doesn't he?

01:24:47.683 --> 01:24:49.618
Wait a minute, Eddie,
check this out.

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:53.339
See? I told you he was going to
kick ass, didn't I tell you that?

01:24:53.356 --> 01:24:54.423
Thanks, guys.

01:24:54.457 --> 01:24:55.591
Congratulations, Stan.

01:24:55.624 --> 01:24:56.825
Thanks. A ski-patrol man!

01:24:56.859 --> 01:24:59.262
Guys? Guys!

01:25:02.265 --> 01:25:04.300
Okay, everybody. All
right, gather around.
