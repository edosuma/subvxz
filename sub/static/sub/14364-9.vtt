What were we thinking,
volunteering for this?

19:23.998 --> 19:25.966
Next time, you need to do
a better job

19:25.967 --> 19:27.935
of talking us out
of these situations.

19:27.936 --> 19:29.803
<i>Next time...</i>

19:29.804 --> 19:31.772
We can buy ourselves
another few seconds

19:31.773 --> 19:33.807
if we're in the back
of the train, right?

19:33.808 --> 19:35.108
Miko...

19:35.109 --> 19:38.412
At least
we're in this together.

19:40.481 --> 19:42.583
<i>Raf, this is important!</i>

19:42.584 --> 19:45.185
Make sure
bulkhead gets my guitar.

19:49.657 --> 19:52.693
Don't read the will just yet.

19:57.532 --> 19:59.700
Where's Optimus?

19:59.701 --> 20:02.169
He had a train to catch.

20:08.343 --> 20:10.344
[ Metal screeching ]

20:18.953 --> 20:20.954
[ Groaning ]

20:35.937 --> 20:39.106
[ Helicopter blades whirring ]

20:41.242 --> 20:43.110
Well played, visitor.

20:43.111 --> 20:45.646
But mech still
has home-field advantage,

20:45.647 --> 20:49.583
and we will find a way
to level that playing field --

20:49.584 --> 20:53.887
Even if we have to open you up
to see what makes you tick.

21:06.367 --> 21:09.603
Optimus, are you
and the children...

21:09.604 --> 21:11.371
Intact?

21:11.372 --> 21:13.373
Intact, Ratchet.

21:13.374 --> 21:15.942
Crisis averted.

21:15.943 --> 21:18.045
But the world in which we live

21:18.046 --> 21:21.014
is a different one
than previously imagined.

21:21.015 --> 21:25.285
One which has spawned
its own Decepticons...

21:25.286 --> 21:27.721
In human skin.

21:30.782 --> 21:35.180
