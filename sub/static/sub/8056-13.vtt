WEBVTT

00:00.461 --> 00:02.477
I will institute
a reduction in taxes

00:02.769 --> 00:04.103
<i>For the small-business owner</i>

00:04.137 --> 00:06.538
as well as a 7% surcharge

00:06.573 --> 00:10.109
on all nonlocal
business-related development.

00:10.143 --> 00:14.012
Together we will build
a better pawnee.

00:14.030 --> 00:16.615
So what we're looking for here

00:16.650 --> 00:19.485
are your overall impressions
of this candidate.

00:19.519 --> 00:22.204
What do you like about her?
What don't you like about her?

00:22.238 --> 00:24.623
Her ideas, her voice,
her clothes probably.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.892
Well, my campaign
has a little momentum,

00:26.926 --> 00:30.362
so we're trying to capitalize
on that by doing a focus group.

00:30.397 --> 00:33.865
Some things are very helpful.
Other things are not so helpful.

00:33.883 --> 00:37.836
All the things make me feel
a lot of feelings about myself.

00:37.870 --> 00:39.905
She's kinda short,
don't you think?

00:39.939 --> 00:41.206
Aggressively short almost.

00:41.224 --> 00:42.341
It's like she's throwing it
in my face.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.676
Insightful.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.478
You, sir, said you would not
vote for her, correct?

00:46.513 --> 00:49.181
Yeah. Yeah,
she seems a little uptight.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.566
She doesn't seem like

00:50.600 --> 00:53.652
the kind of person you could go
bowling with, you know?

00:53.687 --> 00:54.653
What?
That's ridiculous.

00:54.688 --> 00:57.356
I am excellent at bowling.
Ask Ron.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.425
Leslie, I know it's tough
to hear these things,

00:59.459 --> 01:02.244
but just try not to get
obsessed over one comment.

01:02.278 --> 01:04.863
You're totally right.
I'm not obsessing.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.064
Okay, what are you doing?

01:06.082 --> 01:07.533
I'm just reminding myself
to tell Ron

01:07.567 --> 01:08.751
to tell you how good I am
at bowling.

01:08.785 --> 01:09.901
All right.

01:09.919 --> 01:11.370
I actually thought
that she was smart,

01:11.404 --> 01:13.839
and I'd vote for her.
There you go.

01:13.873 --> 01:16.592
Although I once knew a Leslie,
and, uh, she was just awful.

01:16.626 --> 01:18.877
So now I hate all Leslies.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.046
Would she consider
changing her name?

01:22.689 --> 01:24.767
Sync and Corrections by <font color="#ffff00">APOLLO</font>

Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

01:41.267 --> 01:43.202
Okay, here we go.

01:43.236 --> 01:45.471
71% said that you have
a strong command of the issues.

01:45.505 --> 01:48.440
That is good, but only 33%

01:48.475 --> 01:50.209
said that they would consider
voting for you.

01:50.243 --> 01:51.377
Mm, yeah,
that's really interesting stuff.

01:51.411 --> 01:52.444
Why did that guy say that he

01:52.479 --> 01:53.612
wouldn't want to go
bowling with me?

01:53.646 --> 01:55.748
You really have to let that go.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.483
I've never been very good
at letting things go.

01:57.517 --> 02:01.019
I can't tell you how many times
a fun tug-of-war with a dog

02:01.054 --> 02:03.288
over a chew toy
turned contentious.

02:03.323 --> 02:05.758
One of us always ends up mad.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.643
I did some research too about
the guy who said the thing

02:07.677 --> 02:09.645
about me and bowling,
and his name is Derek.

02:09.679 --> 02:11.062
Oh, my God.

02:11.097 --> 02:12.964
And get this... he's not
even that good of a bowler.

02:12.982 --> 02:14.132
His average is 132,

02:14.150 --> 02:15.768
according to the most recent
available data.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.637
Leslie, that comment

02:18.655 --> 02:21.106
wasn't really about whether
you're good at bowling...

02:21.141 --> 02:23.409
- which I am. Ask Ron.
- Which we all know you are.

02:23.443 --> 02:24.943
But some people
have the impression

02:24.978 --> 02:27.446
that you're a little elitist
or intellectual or something.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.948
That is so sexist.
It's just because I'm a woman.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.551
Would they deign
to say such things

02:32.585 --> 02:34.720
to Woodrow Wilson
or Benjamin Disraeli...

02:34.754 --> 02:36.288
okay, I see what
you're talking about.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.322
See, a lot of people
don't vote with their brains.

02:37.340 --> 02:38.690
They vote with their guts.

02:38.725 --> 02:40.092
I know you're fun,
and you can have a good time.

02:40.126 --> 02:42.461
The public needs to see that.

02:42.495 --> 02:46.298
Well, then maybe the campaign
should host a bowling night.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.133
- Hmm.
- It would be laid-back.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.935
Everyone having fun,
great photo op.

02:49.969 --> 02:51.103
That could actually work.

02:51.137 --> 02:52.204
Also I'm really good
at bowling.

02:52.238 --> 02:53.856
No, I don't think
I believe you.

02:53.890 --> 02:54.973
Is there anyone I can ask?

02:55.008 --> 02:56.608
Yeah.
Ask Ron.

02:56.643 --> 02:59.778
Oh, okay.
You're kidding.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.346
All right, it is time

03:01.381 --> 03:04.032
for the 12th Leslie Knope
Fundraising Phone Bank.

03:04.067 --> 03:05.717
Is everybody feeling good?

03:05.752 --> 03:07.736
Oh, I don't know, Jerry.
It's Sunday night,

03:07.787 --> 03:09.354
I'm making phone calls
to strangers,

03:09.389 --> 03:11.323
and you're in my house.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.658
My life couldn't be worse.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.992
Hey!

03:14.027 --> 03:15.694
Let's get
this phone party started.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.863
- No.
- Sorry I'm late, guys.

03:17.897 --> 03:19.197
I know this kind of thing

03:19.215 --> 03:20.916
can be a grind,
but Ben said that this

03:20.967 --> 03:23.702
is the most important thing
we can do to help Leslie.

03:23.736 --> 03:25.871
So tonight is going to be fun.

03:25.905 --> 03:28.974
You're probably thinking,
how could it possibly be fun?

03:30.710 --> 03:33.679
- No one's thinking that.
- I kinda was.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.014
I was not.

03:36.048 --> 03:37.916
Why are we laughing?

03:37.951 --> 03:40.385
Well, anyway, tonight
we are gonna spice things up

03:40.420 --> 03:41.887
with a little competition.

03:41.921 --> 03:43.856
Whoever raises the most money
by the end of the night

03:43.890 --> 03:47.860
will win two free movie passes
to the pawnee mono-plex.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.695
You really think
that's gonna motivate people...

03:49.729 --> 03:51.947
oh, my God.

03:51.998 --> 03:55.284
I could use that for a romantic
night with Millicent Gergich.

03:55.335 --> 03:56.902
Out of my way, suckers.

03:56.936 --> 03:59.204
As city manager,
I play no favorites.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.572
But as a private citizen,

04:00.590 --> 04:03.008
I am free to support
whomever I choose,

04:03.042 --> 04:05.043
and I choose to support
team Knope

04:05.077 --> 04:07.813
'cause they're the best.
Everybody's the best.

04:07.847 --> 04:11.917
We're all winners.

04:11.951 --> 04:13.452
- Do I look laid-back?

04:13.486 --> 04:16.254
- You look like you're trying
to look laid-back.

04:16.272 --> 04:17.990
How about now?

04:18.024 --> 04:20.559
I think just... maybe just stand
how you would normally stand.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.828
Okay.

04:22.862 --> 04:25.063
I forget now.
Hey, Ron.

04:25.097 --> 04:27.399
Thanks for coming, man.
Of course.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.335
This bowling alley has my
favorite restaurant in pawnee.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.776
Really?
You're not scared to eat here?

04:37.810 --> 04:41.713
When I eat,
it is the food that is scared.

04:41.748 --> 04:43.048
Why are you sitting weird?

04:43.082 --> 04:46.117
- Damn it.
- Who's ready to bowl so hard?

04:46.135 --> 04:48.887
Tommy's new bowling swag.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.389
You know what?
When you do it,

04:50.423 --> 04:51.757
you really do it.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.175
Good for you, man.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.761
Hello, I'm calling on behalf
of Leslie Knope,

04:55.795 --> 04:57.563
who is running
for city council.

04:57.597 --> 05:00.432
Is this Deirdre Splatterfork?

05:00.466 --> 05:01.633
That is literally
the most beautiful name

05:01.668 --> 05:03.018
I have ever heard.

05:03.069 --> 05:06.238
No, I don't think we can
accept donations over $50.

05:06.272 --> 05:07.272
I don't really know
why you would need

05:07.307 --> 05:09.341
my social security number,

05:09.375 --> 05:10.993
but... well, yeah, no.
You're right.

05:11.027 --> 05:13.328
I guess it couldn't hurt
to give it to you. It's 210...

05:13.363 --> 05:15.414
absolutely nothing.

05:15.448 --> 05:18.000
What are you wearing?

05:18.034 --> 05:19.918
Fine, if you don't wanna
donate, then don't.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.253
Oh, by the way...

05:21.287 --> 05:23.672
I'm calling
from inside your house.

05:23.706 --> 05:27.125
- Ha ha! $100.
- Whoa.

05:27.159 --> 05:30.712
This is unbelievable.
I cannot be stopped.

05:35.852 --> 05:37.302
I don't care about that prize,

05:37.337 --> 05:40.172
but I'm gonna win because I want
his happiness to go away.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.675
Type in "T Rex" for me.

05:43.693 --> 05:46.445
No, no, no.
Um, "t-boz."

05:46.479 --> 05:50.115
Wait, wait.
"Tommy Tsunami."

05:50.149 --> 05:51.533
No,
"ticky ticky Tom-Tom."

05:51.567 --> 05:53.902
No,
"fly guy."

05:53.953 --> 05:54.987
I wrote "tom."

05:55.021 --> 05:57.239
Classic.
Timeless.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.524
I love it.

05:59.559 --> 06:02.694
"Girl"?

06:02.712 --> 06:04.329
I saw your ad
from when you were a kid,

06:04.364 --> 06:05.831
but it's nice to have a beer
and get to know you.

06:05.865 --> 06:06.832
Aw, thanks, rich.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.001
Oh, here.
Smile.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.969
Maybe you'll get your picture
<i>the pawnee journal.</i>

06:12.038 --> 06:13.205
Hey, this is going really well.

06:13.239 --> 06:14.806
Pretty decent turnout.

06:14.841 --> 06:17.409
Yeah, you know, I feel very,
you know, casual, relaxed.

06:17.443 --> 06:21.313
Hey, is that the guy from
the... from the focus group?

06:21.347 --> 06:23.565
Huh.
I don't know.

06:23.599 --> 06:25.384
- I think it is.
- Is it?

06:25.418 --> 06:27.152
Excuse me, sir,
would you mind telling me

06:27.186 --> 06:29.221
how you heard
about the event tonight?

06:29.255 --> 06:31.823
Oh, uh, I got
a weird invitation in the mail.

06:31.858 --> 06:34.192
I didn't realize we were
sending out invitations.

06:34.226 --> 06:35.694
Oh.

06:35.728 --> 06:39.031
Hey, you're that girl from
the focus group thing I did.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.766
Oh, I wouldn't know.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.768
I'm never on the other side
of the glass with those things.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.086
Can I talk to you for a sec?

06:44.120 --> 06:48.407
Yep.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.575
Straight down the middle.

06:50.593 --> 06:53.679
No hook, no spin, no fuss.

06:53.713 --> 06:58.417
Anything more
and this becomes figure skating.

06:58.451 --> 07:00.102
Come on, big girl.

07:00.136 --> 07:03.689
Let's knock
these little pins down.

07:06.642 --> 07:08.393
Oh, my God, are you serious?

07:08.427 --> 07:11.430
Son, people can see you.

07:19.989 --> 07:22.574
Boom!

07:22.608 --> 07:25.444
That right there...
Tommy's strike.

07:25.478 --> 07:27.612
Leslie, what happened
to the big picture?

07:27.630 --> 07:28.964
I'm thinking
about the big picture.

07:28.998 --> 07:30.115
I'm trying to make
the picture bigger

07:30.133 --> 07:31.416
by including this guy in it.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.419
I can't do anything about
my gender or my height,

07:34.454 --> 07:38.924
but I can win that guy over
with a fun round of bowling.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.059
We need everyone here to see a
different side of Leslie Knope,

07:41.094 --> 07:42.461
not one specific person.

07:42.495 --> 07:44.262
Some people just
aren't gonna like you.

07:44.296 --> 07:46.965
Let it go.
Okay, I hear you.

07:46.983 --> 07:49.901
I'll treat him
just like everybody else.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.137
I'll just say hi to him,
shake his hand,

07:52.155 --> 07:54.156
buy a him a few beers,

07:54.190 --> 07:56.324
share a few laughs,
bowl a few frames,

07:56.359 --> 07:57.909
lose intentionally
to make him feel good,

07:57.944 --> 07:59.044
friend him on Facebook.

07:59.078 --> 08:02.214
And by the end of the night,
he will be mine.

08:05.479 --> 08:08.305
Whoa, "thar" she bowls.

08:08.323 --> 08:10.491
I'm Leslie Knope.

08:10.525 --> 08:11.942
You wanna bowl?
You wanna bowl together?

08:11.976 --> 08:12.943
You wanna be, like,
bowl buddies?

08:12.977 --> 08:13.978
Sure.

08:14.012 --> 08:16.530
Great,
just a casual game, you know?

08:16.581 --> 08:19.250
No biggie.
You okay?

08:19.284 --> 08:22.053
My sister has scoliosis, and I
think you might, you know...

08:22.087 --> 08:23.921
Oh, no. No, I'm just...
I'm just being cas.

08:23.955 --> 08:25.656
What are you rocking?
A 15 pounder?

08:25.674 --> 08:28.259
- 16.
- Whoa, hey, good for you.

08:28.293 --> 08:30.594
Oh, there they are. I just
ordered some wings for us.

08:30.629 --> 08:31.929
You like wings?

08:31.963 --> 08:33.996
- Love them.
- Really? Who knew?

08:34.015 --> 08:35.570
I knew.

08:42.640 --> 08:43.707
Damn it.

08:43.741 --> 08:45.309
Why are you mad?
You bowled a strike.

08:45.343 --> 08:47.912
That's how I motivate myself,
you know?

08:47.946 --> 08:49.196
Never good enough.

08:49.231 --> 08:51.032
Let me get you a beer.
Cool.

08:51.066 --> 08:55.119
These beers are as cold
as the Tuktoyaktuk Winter Road.

08:55.153 --> 08:57.555
You watch <i>Ice Road Truckers?</i>

08:57.589 --> 09:00.357
Yeah, dude.
It's my guilty pleasure.

09:00.375 --> 09:03.394
Tom, I'm asking you as a man
to stop this immediately.

09:12.370 --> 09:15.339
- Boom!
- What the?

09:15.373 --> 09:18.142
Hello,
is this Mrs. Gallivan?

09:18.176 --> 09:21.612
Well, my name is April,
and wouldn't you know it,

09:21.646 --> 09:24.915
I'm raising money for a city
council candidate I believe in.

09:24.950 --> 09:26.917
No, <i>mira, mira, mira,</i>
<i>mira, mira.</i>

09:26.952 --> 09:28.619
It's, like, whatever you want.

09:28.653 --> 09:29.987
Like, $10.
It don't matter.

09:30.021 --> 09:31.489
Well,
I reckon it's just like

09:31.523 --> 09:33.991
grammy Martha told me
and my cousins,

09:34.025 --> 09:36.727
"you can't eat the biscuits
if you don't pay for the flour."

09:39.564 --> 09:42.767
Put the phone down,
take a deep breath,

09:42.801 --> 09:45.286
and then you
are going to tell Steven

09:45.337 --> 09:49.306
that you will be treated
with respect, okay?

09:49.341 --> 09:51.742
And thank you
for your donation.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.844
Well, gee, I don't know, Fred.

09:53.879 --> 09:57.748
All I know is that
I just want to live in a world

09:57.783 --> 09:59.266
that's a better place,

09:59.301 --> 10:02.186
and your contribution will
definitely help us get there,

10:02.220 --> 10:05.856
to the...

10:05.891 --> 10:10.728
Better-place world,
Fred.

10:10.762 --> 10:12.780
Yeehaw!

10:12.814 --> 10:15.866
Man, move over, pins.
There's a new Sheriff in town.

10:15.901 --> 10:19.570
You are so down with strikes,
they should call you Norma Rae.

10:19.604 --> 10:21.989
- Who's that?
- It's a...

10:22.040 --> 10:24.107
Sally Field movie about Unions.
Doesn't matter.

10:24.126 --> 10:25.409
The point is,
you're really good at this.

10:25.444 --> 10:27.912
It's your turn.
Try not to break a nail.

10:27.946 --> 10:30.498
Ah, classic Derek
with the Zings.

10:30.549 --> 10:32.299
Man, that's what bowling
is all about... hey.

10:32.334 --> 10:33.484
How's it going?

10:33.518 --> 10:34.969
- It's going really good.
- Oh, good.

10:35.003 --> 10:36.387
Um, we're just hanging out
and having a very good time.

10:36.421 --> 10:37.855
Okay, I just wanted
to remind you that

10:37.889 --> 10:40.558
when you're bowling, try not
to fixate on just one pin.

10:40.592 --> 10:43.828
You're trying to knock down
a lot of pins.

10:43.862 --> 10:46.063
I realize that,
but I will knock down this pin,

10:46.097 --> 10:47.731
and then this pin will knock
down all the other pins.

10:47.766 --> 10:48.899
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

10:48.934 --> 10:51.168
Hey, could you get me
another one of these?

10:51.203 --> 10:52.803
I...
I don't work here.

10:52.838 --> 10:54.304
Classic Derek.

10:54.322 --> 10:56.440
I am taking
a probiotic tea break.

10:56.475 --> 10:57.942
And while that is happening,

10:57.976 --> 10:59.326
I thought I might share
some big news.

10:59.361 --> 11:03.047
I am going to ask Millicent
Gergich to move in with me.

11:03.081 --> 11:05.449
D-I... I mean, if that's okay
with you of course, Jerry.

11:05.483 --> 11:09.086
- Uh, yeah.
- Of course. Sure.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.521
That's awesome, man.

11:10.555 --> 11:12.756
Hey, do you guys wanna live here
with us and Ben

11:12.791 --> 11:14.458
and champion,
the three-legged dog?

11:14.492 --> 11:17.595
- That is an amazing offer.
- Yes!

11:17.629 --> 11:19.797
But I think we're probably
gonna get our own place.

11:19.831 --> 11:21.765
I'm already working
with a Real Estate agent

11:21.800 --> 11:23.133
to find an octagonal house.

11:23.167 --> 11:25.436
I've done some reading,
and an octagon

11:25.470 --> 11:27.705
is the optimal shape for a home
in terms of energy flow.

11:27.739 --> 11:29.506
You know, Chris,
I hate to pull rank,

11:29.524 --> 11:31.141
but if you're going
to take a break,

11:31.175 --> 11:32.576
would you mind going
in the living room,

11:32.611 --> 11:35.012
just, you know, so it doesn't
disturb everybody else.

11:35.046 --> 11:37.948
Jerry, I love it
when you pull rank.

11:37.983 --> 11:39.116
You're being weird.
Why?

11:39.150 --> 11:41.218
Milli's gonna break up
with Chris.

11:41.253 --> 11:42.519
Shut up.

11:42.537 --> 11:43.521
Oh, my God,
that's gonna super weird

11:43.555 --> 11:45.055
when they move in together.

11:45.090 --> 11:48.542
Yeah, I don't know when, but
she is definitely gonna do it.

11:55.050 --> 11:58.052
Nice.

12:02.874 --> 12:04.642
Hey, Ron.
Were you trying to get a seven?

12:04.676 --> 12:06.343
Because if you were,
you did a great job.

12:06.377 --> 12:10.481
I am very angry right now.

12:10.515 --> 12:13.384
What?

12:13.418 --> 12:16.219
My finger was in there.

12:16.238 --> 12:17.571
Ron crushed my finger.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.773
I think it might be broken.

12:19.824 --> 12:22.993
- Are you a female bird?
- It was an accident.

12:23.028 --> 12:25.763
Oh, my God,
it's already swollen.

12:25.797 --> 12:28.098
Tom, my God, do you have
any pride at all?

12:28.133 --> 12:30.701
You did this on purpose.
You're jealous of my gift.

12:30.735 --> 12:33.037
Okay, come on, Tweety Bird,
let's get you some ice.

12:33.071 --> 12:35.238
- It hurts.
- Come on.

12:35.257 --> 12:38.342
Well, congratulations, man.

12:38.376 --> 12:40.678
Fun match, fun game,
good times.

12:40.712 --> 12:42.279
Did you have fun?
Yeah.

12:42.314 --> 12:45.015
I'm not one to complain about
free beer and free bowling.

12:45.050 --> 12:46.416
See you around.
Okay.

12:46.434 --> 12:48.269
Uh, just one second.

12:48.303 --> 12:51.555
I'm running for city council,
as you know,

12:51.590 --> 12:54.024
and uh, just wondering,
do I have your vote?

12:54.059 --> 12:56.360
- No.
- Derek.

12:56.394 --> 12:58.028
You old so-and-so.

12:58.063 --> 12:59.280
For reals,
can I count on your vote?

12:59.314 --> 13:01.966
Yeah, no, um, I don't think so.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.669
But we've been here
bowling all night,

13:05.704 --> 13:06.904
and we've been having fun.

13:06.938 --> 13:10.474
And you're still not
gonna vote for me? Why?

13:10.508 --> 13:13.744
- I don't like you, okay?
- Leslie, Leslie.

13:13.778 --> 13:15.779
Well, you're a crappy bowler,

13:15.797 --> 13:17.114
and I pretended to lose to you.

13:17.132 --> 13:19.133
Yeah, right.
I destroyed you.

13:19.167 --> 13:20.317
No, it's true.

13:20.352 --> 13:23.120
I am a really good bowler.
Ask Ron.

13:23.138 --> 13:24.722
I don't know who Ron is.

13:24.756 --> 13:26.223
But if you're so great,
let's play again.

13:26.257 --> 13:27.558
Good.
I'd love to.

13:27.592 --> 13:29.626
Tell you what, if I win,
I get your vote.

13:29.644 --> 13:31.895
If I win, you clean
my house for a month.

13:31.930 --> 13:33.314
- Done.
- Hey, Leslie.

13:33.348 --> 13:35.683
I'd like to introduce you
to my good friend, anyone else.

13:35.734 --> 13:36.984
Not now, Ben.

13:37.018 --> 13:39.236
I'd like to introduce
Derek's ass to my foot.

13:39.270 --> 13:41.271
Get me another beer.

13:41.305 --> 13:42.489
I don't work here.

13:42.524 --> 13:44.908
$20?
Thank you.

13:44.943 --> 13:46.994
Uh, you know, we're really
looking for donations

13:47.028 --> 13:49.747
more in the $10,000 range.

13:49.781 --> 13:51.415
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

13:51.449 --> 13:53.283
Just one second.
Let me get off this call.

13:53.317 --> 13:58.088
Hi, I'm so sorry.
I'm back.

14:07.732 --> 14:10.901
What, champion?
You need to go outside now?

14:10.935 --> 14:13.503
Come on.
That a boy.

14:13.521 --> 14:17.105
Sorry, he's...
hates awkward situations.

14:22.881 --> 14:26.817
Oh!

14:26.851 --> 14:28.869
- Terrible moonwalk.
- Don't care.

14:32.957 --> 14:34.524
Yeah, what's up now, huh?

14:34.542 --> 14:38.862
Aw, you got a spare.
That's so cute.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.497
Check out the scoreboard.

14:40.531 --> 14:44.168
So Millicent and I are going
to take a nice little stroll,

14:44.202 --> 14:45.569
and I'll be back soon.

14:45.603 --> 14:46.737
You know, if you want to take
the rest of the night off,

14:46.771 --> 14:47.971
you know, that would be fine.

14:48.006 --> 14:49.773
Well, I don't think
that will be necessary.

14:49.808 --> 14:52.576
Unless you also want
to go get dinner.

14:52.610 --> 14:54.845
Nope, this won't take too long.

14:54.879 --> 14:57.014
Chris, you might want
to take a jacket with you.

14:57.048 --> 14:59.216
It's about to get cold
out there.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.018
Thanks, Donna, but Millicent's
company will keep me warm.

15:01.052 --> 15:02.352
Take the jacket.

15:02.387 --> 15:05.689
I wished for his happiness
to go away.

15:05.724 --> 15:08.692
I might be a wizard.

15:10.695 --> 15:13.247
Hey, Derek.
What a defeat, man.

15:13.281 --> 15:15.499
I mean, I did not expect
to win by that much.

15:15.533 --> 15:17.835
But I warned you,
I am a good bowler.

15:17.869 --> 15:19.920
- Whatever.
- All joking aside,

15:19.954 --> 15:21.872
I wanna say
that I actually had fun.

15:21.906 --> 15:25.042
And I'm really looking forward
to your vote in the spring.

15:25.076 --> 15:27.127
Yeah, I'll just write
in "bitch."

15:27.178 --> 15:28.879
I'm sorry,
what did you just say?

15:28.913 --> 15:30.881
Just ignore him.
He's being a jerk.

15:30.915 --> 15:32.933
I said she's a bitch.

15:32.967 --> 15:35.252
- Oh, my God.
- What the hell?

15:35.270 --> 15:37.688
I'm so sorry.

15:37.722 --> 15:39.623
I'm so sorry.
That was awesome.

15:39.657 --> 15:43.393
I'm so sorry.

15:43.428 --> 15:46.613
Oh, look.
Here's that photo op you wanted.

15:46.648 --> 15:48.087
- Ow.
- Sorry.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.220
So... you know... that's
everything that happens

15:50.250 --> 15:52.135
so it was just what happened.
It was just like...

15:53.988 --> 15:55.689
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know, I just...

15:55.740 --> 15:56.740
I have a lot of adrenaline
right now.

15:56.775 --> 15:59.276
Just take a few deep breaths,
okay?

15:59.310 --> 16:00.661
The guy said
he might press charges.

16:00.695 --> 16:02.162
Yeah, well, Randy,
I would like you to know

16:02.197 --> 16:03.614
that we will not
be pressing charges.

16:03.648 --> 16:05.165
Yeah, that really
wasn't an option.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.117
Come on, the guy
was being a total jerk.

16:07.151 --> 16:08.752
What Ben did was warranted

16:08.787 --> 16:10.587
and extremely awesome,
by the way.

16:10.622 --> 16:12.489
Did you write down
how awesome it was?

16:12.507 --> 16:13.857
When we write official reports,

16:13.892 --> 16:16.460
we refrain from using words
like "jerk" or "awesome."

16:16.494 --> 16:18.679
- Hey, here you go.
- Hey.

16:18.713 --> 16:20.597
Wow, you and me, huh?
Hurt "fingies."

16:20.632 --> 16:23.016
No, no,
two totally different injuries.

16:23.051 --> 16:25.853
Okay, you...
just hang in there, okay?

16:25.887 --> 16:27.955
Okay, love you too.
Bye-bye.

16:27.989 --> 16:30.674
Well, that was Milli.
It happened.

16:30.708 --> 16:32.009
She broke up with Chris.

16:32.043 --> 16:33.811
- Boo.
- Damn you, Jerry.

16:33.845 --> 16:36.029
It's not my fault.

16:36.064 --> 16:38.048
Well, I feel sorry for the man.

16:38.082 --> 16:40.117
Well, anyway, the fundraising
challenge is over,

16:40.151 --> 16:41.752
and the winner...
whoa.

16:41.786 --> 16:44.121
We have a surprise winner,
April.

16:44.155 --> 16:47.157
April wins two tickets
to the pawnee mono-plex.

16:47.192 --> 16:50.694
- Yes.
- That's my wife.

16:52.085 --> 16:54.030
Okay,
everything's settled here.

16:54.048 --> 16:55.833
Wanna head home?
No.

16:55.867 --> 16:58.702
We haven't finished yet.
Last frame, your turn.

16:58.736 --> 17:01.672
- He hurt his hand.
- Last frame, go.

17:01.706 --> 17:04.558
- Fine, I'll bowl one-handed,
like an idiot.

17:11.583 --> 17:14.401
Whoo!
Oh, come on.

17:14.435 --> 17:16.252
King Kong
ain't got nothing on me.

17:16.287 --> 17:18.070
Ow, my "fingie" still hurts.

17:18.106 --> 17:20.557
Oh, the bravery.
The perseverance.

17:20.575 --> 17:21.592
You're an American hero.

17:21.626 --> 17:23.609
And the best part is,
beautiful,

17:23.661 --> 17:26.747
you get to drive
the champion home.

17:26.781 --> 17:28.866
Well, the headline
I would've gone with is

17:28.900 --> 17:33.871
"no-strike-bowling bowler struck
by Knope's striking beau."

17:33.905 --> 17:35.005
Okay, one more time.

17:35.039 --> 17:36.807
Let me resign.

17:36.841 --> 17:38.275
It's the only thing
that truly protects you.

17:38.309 --> 17:40.244
- Non-starter.

17:40.278 --> 17:43.463
- Okay.
- Now when you take questions,

17:43.515 --> 17:46.016
I think you should be
brief and sincere.

17:46.050 --> 17:47.684
Don't try to justify
what I did.

17:47.719 --> 17:49.970
Just apologize again,
and stay on script.

17:50.021 --> 17:52.022
Are you sure that you don't need
more whipped cream?

17:52.056 --> 17:53.891
Not today.
I don't deserve it.

17:53.925 --> 17:58.695
I got us into this mess because
I was fixating on that guy.

17:58.730 --> 18:00.097
But this is ridiculous.

18:00.131 --> 18:01.798
I do need more whipped cream.
Ma'am.

18:04.118 --> 18:05.619
Hi.

18:05.653 --> 18:08.956
April Ludgate.
How are you doing?

18:08.990 --> 18:12.793
Uh, whatever.
I'm fine.

18:12.827 --> 18:13.911
Um, how are you?

18:13.945 --> 18:16.797
Well, as you may know,
Millicent Gergich

18:16.831 --> 18:18.115
ended our relationship
last night,

18:18.149 --> 18:20.617
which was disappointing.

18:20.652 --> 18:23.487
But here's why

18:23.521 --> 18:27.057
it may be the greatest thing
that ever happened.

18:32.263 --> 18:36.166
Yeah, good point.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.068
Hadn't thought about it
that way.

18:38.102 --> 18:41.989
Um, here.

18:42.023 --> 18:43.156
Take these tickets.

18:43.191 --> 18:44.875
- Oh, no, no, no.
Y-you earned them.

18:44.909 --> 18:46.009
They're movie tickets, Chris.

18:46.044 --> 18:48.245
They're, like, 8 bucks.

18:48.279 --> 18:49.246
It's a gesture.

18:49.280 --> 18:50.364
There are three of them.

18:50.415 --> 18:51.415
I thought there were only two.

18:51.449 --> 18:53.250
Yeah, I know,
I bought another one

18:53.284 --> 18:55.886
because I thought
that maybe you, me, and Andy

18:55.920 --> 19:00.557
could go
to the movies sometime.

19:00.592 --> 19:02.793
Just take the stupid tickets.

19:02.827 --> 19:04.828
I'm just trying to be nice.

19:04.846 --> 19:09.366
- Thank you.
- There you go.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.469
Okay, bye.

19:12.503 --> 19:14.438
Leslie, are you going
to fire Ben Wyatt?

19:14.472 --> 19:16.106
Are you going
to suspend your campaign?

19:16.140 --> 19:18.525
I'd like to first start
by saying thank you for coming.

19:18.559 --> 19:20.310
And on behalf of Ben Wyatt

19:20.345 --> 19:22.279
and everyone involved
in my campaign,

19:22.313 --> 19:24.448
I'm very sorry
for what happened

19:24.482 --> 19:28.285
at the rock n' roll
bowling alley last night.

19:28.319 --> 19:31.722
You know what?
No, I'm not.

19:31.756 --> 19:32.956
- I...
- I'm not sorry.

19:32.991 --> 19:36.359
This guy was drunk,
and he was aggressive.

19:36.377 --> 19:38.078
And he was rude,
and he was foul-mouthed.

19:38.129 --> 19:41.264
And he called me by my second
least favorite term for a woman,

19:41.299 --> 19:43.367
and my campaign manager
punched him.

19:43.401 --> 19:44.635
I do not condone violence,

19:44.669 --> 19:47.754
but I have to be honest,
it was awesome.

19:47.805 --> 19:51.475
And my campaign manager and I
made out a lot afterward.

19:51.509 --> 19:52.943
Ah, I probably shouldn't
have said that.

19:52.977 --> 19:55.178
But that's what happened.

19:55.213 --> 19:57.714
Derek hates me, and I don't
particularly like him.

19:57.749 --> 20:02.385
So what's the point,
right, Derek?

20:02.403 --> 20:04.438
I feel like you're being
kind of a bitch right now.

20:04.489 --> 20:06.823
See?
So I'm not going to apologize.

20:06.858 --> 20:09.026
And if people won't vote
for me because of that,

20:09.060 --> 20:10.327
well, there's nothing
I can do about it.

20:10.361 --> 20:11.995
But you should be warned.

20:12.030 --> 20:13.947
If you do not vote for me,

20:13.998 --> 20:16.566
my boyfriend might beat you up.

20:16.584 --> 20:18.335
Now if anyone has any questions

20:18.369 --> 20:22.405
about the issues facing our
city, I'm right here.

20:22.423 --> 20:25.242
Okay, what are your overall
impressions of this woman?

20:25.276 --> 20:28.762
What do you like about her?
What don't you like about her?

20:28.796 --> 20:29.913
- I like her.
- What do you like

20:29.931 --> 20:31.114
about her specifically?

20:31.149 --> 20:33.183
I don't know.
She's tough, I guess.

20:33.217 --> 20:34.417
I just like her.

20:34.435 --> 20:36.953
I like that that one guy
punched that other guy,

20:36.988 --> 20:39.639
and then I like
that she stood by him.

20:39.691 --> 20:41.391
See?
People vote with their gut.

20:41.425 --> 20:44.094
Yeah, that guy said
he didn't like my earrings.

20:44.112 --> 20:45.095
Go punch him.
Sure.

20:47.048 --> 20:48.064
Here you go.
Lane eight.

20:48.622 --> 20:52.157
No, Lane 22.
The one at the very end.

20:58.608 --> 21:00.709
Son of a bitch.

21:13.657 --> 21:16.892
Hey, perfect game.
What's your name?

21:16.927 --> 21:18.194
Put it up on a wall.

21:18.196 --> 21:19.469
I was never here,

21:19.852 --> 21:21.962
and you will never
speak of this again
