00:26.026 --> 00:28.187
Henry, you just sit there...

00:28.261 --> 00:30.252
and read those baseball scores.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.264
Don't let me bother you, huh?

00:32.332 --> 00:34.562
Where that girl is...

00:34.634 --> 00:37.694
She was supposed to be back here
an hour ago with the groceries.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.864
Dinner's gonna be late.

00:39.939 --> 00:42.499
Thinks the world revolves
around her.

00:42.575 --> 00:45.009
You were talking
in your sleep again, Henry.

00:45.078 --> 00:48.570
- What do you think so far?
- There's no leg room.

00:48.648 --> 00:51.776
- It's so crowded.
- Well, it's supposed to be crowded.

00:51.851 --> 00:53.876
It's sold out.

00:53.953 --> 00:56.478
You know, this play
is going to New York.

00:56.556 --> 00:59.992
Can you believe it?
My sister in an off-Broadway show?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.550
So where is she?

01:01.585 --> 01:04.307
She's in the next scene.
She kills a guy.

01:04.342 --> 01:07.265
I hope it's the guy who
designed these seats.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.230
There she is.

01:19.712 --> 01:23.341
Hey, Cuz.
You miss me?

01:25.318 --> 01:27.946
Hope you don't mind...
I let myself in.

01:28.021 --> 01:31.081
But you're supposed to be in jail.

01:31.157 --> 01:34.126
It's funny, that phrase,
"supposed to be."

01:35.361 --> 01:40.424
I'm supposed to be in jail;
you're supposed to be waiting for me.

01:40.500 --> 01:44.436
A man can't count on
"supposed to be" the way he used to.

01:44.504 --> 01:47.667
You know, my husband's upstairs.
If he hears you he'll come down...

01:47.740 --> 01:53.076
Your husband's downtown
drowning himself in scotch and soda.

01:53.146 --> 01:55.011
I saw him leave about an hour ago.

01:55.081 --> 01:57.948
I've got some money in my purse.
Why don't you just take it and go?

01:58.017 --> 01:59.792
You think I want your pocket change?

01:59.827 --> 02:01.885
You think that's why I came back?

02:05.458 --> 02:08.723
Who ordered the tossed salad?

02:12.665 --> 02:14.826
I came back for what's mine.

02:14.901 --> 02:17.301
- You know, if you don't leave, I'll...
- You'll what? Huh?

02:17.370 --> 02:19.702
You'll do nothin'!

02:23.810 --> 02:27.177
Like I said, I'm here for what's mine.

02:33.186 --> 02:36.917
Hal, are you okay?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.981
Hal? Hal?

02:39.058 --> 02:42.926
- Is she supposed to say "Hal"?
- Hal, are you all right?

02:42.996 --> 02:45.021
Oh, my God.

02:48.234 --> 02:50.168
Is there a doctor in the house?
Anyone!

02:50.236 --> 02:52.704
I'm a doctor.

03:02.315 --> 03:04.517
I thought I grabbed the prop knife.
It was supposed to...

03:04.542 --> 03:05.944
It was supposed to be the prop knife.

03:07.954 --> 03:10.047
- He's dead.
- Oh, my God.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.788
He's been stabbed!

03:22.096 --> 03:24.713
MONK Season 2 Epi. 06
Mr. Monk Goes to the Theater

04:19.726 --> 04:22.194
Do not insult us.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.696
There were 300 people in that theater.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.809
They all saw it, Gail.

04:26.844 --> 04:29.644
I can't tell you what they saw.
I can only tell you what I did.

04:29.679 --> 04:31.404
I can tell you what they saw.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.668
They saw you pick up
a five-inch kitchen knife...

04:33.740 --> 04:35.605
and plunge it into Hal Duncan's chest.

04:35.675 --> 04:37.666
Then they saw him fall, dead.

04:37.744 --> 04:40.338
I didn't do it. Come on, Randy.
You know me.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.472
You two are pals? - Yeah.

04:42.548 --> 04:45.312
Well, no. Not exactly.
We met last year.

04:45.385 --> 04:47.785
- Gail, I can't help you here.
- All right, Gail. Why don't we go...

04:47.854 --> 04:50.129
She's scared to death.
I gotta go in there.

04:50.164 --> 04:53.224
Sharona, you can't.

04:53.293 --> 04:57.662
Okay. There are two knives onstage.
One of them is real.

04:57.730 --> 05:01.291
I use it to cut a tomato in the second act.
The other one is retractable,

05:01.367 --> 05:03.267
- so it looks like he's being stabbed.
- Right.

05:03.336 --> 05:07.170
There are two knives onstage.
Knife number one is on the counter.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.505
Knife number two is sticking
in the guy's chest.

05:10.576 --> 05:14.376
Look, here's the problem, Gail...
Both knives were real.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.109
There's no way. I'm telling you.

05:16.144 --> 05:18.508
It was a prop knife.
I can tell the difference.

05:18.584 --> 05:21.348
- Look, Gail, I like you.
- We both like you.

05:21.421 --> 05:23.514
So please, stop insulting us.

05:23.589 --> 05:26.013
Why would I kill him in front of everybody?

05:26.048 --> 05:27.081
People do it every day.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.493
You were having
a relationship with the victim.

05:30.563 --> 05:32.861
You'd been seeing him
for nearly a year.

05:32.932 --> 05:35.713
- It was just seven months.
- He broke it off. You were upset.

05:35.748 --> 05:37.737
You sent him some e-mails.

05:37.772 --> 05:40.035
They were pretty emotional.
Th-That's what I heard.

05:40.106 --> 05:41.860
Who you been talking to,
Randy? The crew?

05:41.895 --> 05:43.940
You wanted to teach your
boyfriend a lesson.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.877
You were pissed off.
You did it in public. You didn't care,

05:46.946 --> 05:48.880
so you took a knife from home,

05:48.948 --> 05:50.686
you switched it
with the knife on the stage,

05:50.721 --> 05:52.543
and then you stuck him in the chest.

05:52.618 --> 05:55.587
- Everybody saw you.
- He's not my boyfriend.

05:55.655 --> 05:57.589
No! Not anymore.

05:57.657 --> 06:01.593
- Now Gail, I...
- I feel so helpless.

06:01.661 --> 06:04.221
Can't you do anything?

06:06.099 --> 06:08.624
Oh, God.

06:08.701 --> 06:13.400
Okay, I got toothpaste,
toothbrush, magazines.

06:13.473 --> 06:16.965
I'm allowed to bring her a towel,
right? - I don't know.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.341
How long can they hold her?

06:19.412 --> 06:22.609
Second-degree murder?
The D. A.'s gonna try to deny her bail...

06:22.682 --> 06:25.617
until she confesses.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.692
Why would she confess?

06:29.021 --> 06:31.046
What? You think she did it?

06:31.124 --> 06:33.820
Sharona, I don't know
what to tell you.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.020
I was there. So were you.

06:36.095 --> 06:39.292
You know, I don't accept that.
She said she was innocent.

06:39.365 --> 06:42.630
Things aren't always what they seem.
Isn't that what you taught me?

06:42.702 --> 06:47.298
Sharona, she stabbed the guy
in front of 300 people.

06:47.373 --> 06:50.308
- Look, I'm not a magician.
- Yes, you are.

06:50.376 --> 06:52.401
You turn things around all the time.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.469
You do it for strangers every day.

06:54.547 --> 06:56.742
So how come you can't do it
for my sister?

07:01.087 --> 07:02.952
- Oh, my God.
- What?

07:03.022 --> 07:06.082
Oh, no. - "Oh, no," what?
Sharona, who is out there?

07:06.159 --> 07:08.150
My mom!
I totally forgot she was coming.

07:08.227 --> 07:10.991
She flew up from Florida to see the play.
This is gonna kill her!

07:11.063 --> 07:12.997
Oh, no.

07:14.300 --> 07:18.600
Look... Look, I might have told her
some things that weren't exactly true.

07:18.671 --> 07:21.037
- Like what?
- Like, Benjy's on the honor roll.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.837
- Oh, okay. No problem.
- Okay, thanks.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.662
Oh! Oh, oh, oh. And...

07:25.697 --> 07:28.313
And I also told her that
my rent is only $900 a month.

07:28.381 --> 07:31.976
And-And-And-And I broke up
with Steve, the florist I was dating.

07:32.051 --> 07:34.042
He didn't break up with me.
Oh, oh.! Oh, oh.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.521
And also that I am seeing a really
nice guy, Ronnie, who's a stockbroker,

07:37.590 --> 07:39.888
but he's out of town
this weekend.

07:39.959 --> 07:43.389
Oh, oh! Oh, oh. And-And you...
you have a full medical plan,

07:43.424 --> 07:45.551
including dental.

07:47.667 --> 07:50.192
And, uh, I'm not your assistant.

07:50.269 --> 07:54.137
I'm... your partner.
Is that okay?

07:54.207 --> 07:58.507
Yeah. Wow!
Congratulations.

07:58.578 --> 08:00.512
Thank you.

08:03.382 --> 08:05.316
- Hey.!
- Hi, Mom!

08:05.384 --> 08:08.751
Hello. Oh, I thought
the bell was broken.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.221
Oh, I'm sorry.
We were in the kitchen.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.860
How come... How come you didn't call me?
I would have picked you up.

08:13.895 --> 08:15.851
Oh, I'm not an invalid.
I grabbed a taxi.

08:15.928 --> 08:19.659
You look wonderful.
Come here. - Oh, Ma.

08:19.732 --> 08:24.396
Ah.! I was so sorry to hear
about Steve, but I say, good riddance.

08:24.470 --> 08:27.701
You're too good
for the schlub. Oh!

08:27.773 --> 08:30.241
Is this our stockbroker? - Uh, no.

08:30.309 --> 08:32.573
I'm not your stockbroker.
He's out of town.

08:32.645 --> 08:37.048
His name is Ronnie.
That's all.

08:37.116 --> 08:38.953
Um, um, this is Adrian, remember?

08:38.988 --> 08:41.780
Oh, the partner.
The partner in crime.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.788
- Mrs. Fleming.
- Oh, no. Call me Cheryl.

08:43.856 --> 08:47.257
- Wipe?
- Not now.

08:47.326 --> 08:49.191
Where's Benjy?
I brought him a new baseball glove.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.457
Oh, he's not here.
He's sleeping over at a friend's house.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.466
You forgot I was coming, didn't you?
No, that's all right. I understand.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.458
You're probably so excited
about the show.

08:56.493 --> 08:57.670
So, how was it last night?

08:57.705 --> 08:59.217
Tell me everything.
How was Gail?

08:59.252 --> 09:00.784
Were there any reviews?

09:00.819 --> 09:03.306
Hey, Ma, you know what? There's-There's
something I've got to tell you.

09:03.376 --> 09:07.369
- What? A bad review?
- Uh, you might want to sit down, Cheryl.

09:07.446 --> 09:09.380
Oh, no, I'm fine.
I've been sittin' all day.

09:09.448 --> 09:11.712
Ma, you know what?
I think it's best that we sit down. - Oh.

09:11.784 --> 09:14.116
Something happened
last night at the show.

09:14.186 --> 09:17.121
Okay - There was a stabbing.

09:17.189 --> 09:20.215
Oh. You mean, in the audience?

09:20.293 --> 09:24.889
No. Uh, no.
Onstage, uh, during the show.

09:24.964 --> 09:28.798
The actor who was
playing Burt was killed.

09:28.868 --> 09:32.099
Gail... stabbed him.

09:32.171 --> 09:35.072
- Oh, I know. I read the script.
- No, no. Cheryl,

09:35.141 --> 09:37.006
he died.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.840
Oh, I-I don't understand.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.676
Neither do we. Uh...

09:42.748 --> 09:45.649
The police think that she might
have done it on purpose.

09:45.718 --> 09:48.915
She's been arrested for murder
in the second degree.

09:48.988 --> 09:51.252
There's a bail hearing tomorrow.

09:51.324 --> 09:54.316
Gail? No.

09:54.393 --> 09:56.861
I don't believe it.
It's a mistake, right?

09:56.929 --> 10:00.023
- The police don't think so.
- Well, they're wrong.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.033
Well, you're gonna
help her, right?

10:02.101 --> 10:05.264
I mean, that's what you do.
You're a couple of detectives, right?

10:06.739 --> 10:09.799
Of course we're going to help her.

10:09.875 --> 10:13.709
After all, we're...
we're a couple of detectives.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.906
- Right?
- Right.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.609
Right.

10:17.683 --> 10:20.618
What? What? What?
Forget it. Forget it.

10:20.686 --> 10:23.655
Excuse me. We're looking
for Gail Fleming's dressing room.

10:23.723 --> 10:27.420
- And you are?
- We're her mother.

10:27.493 --> 10:29.427
Backstage, then down the stairs.

10:29.495 --> 10:32.089
We'll be right back.
We're just gonna pick up her stuff.

10:37.770 --> 10:40.568
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't eat those. They're props.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.667
- And you are?
- I'm O'Dell. I'm the prop master.

10:44.744 --> 10:48.441
- Well, they taste terrible.
- But they look delicious.

10:48.514 --> 10:50.505
And that's the point.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.347
It's just an apple.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.355
It hurts, Mama.

10:57.423 --> 11:00.324
It hurts worse than anything
else I've ever felt.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.226
Can I help you?

11:04.556 --> 11:07.197
Um, yeah. I'm...
I'm Sharona, Gail's sister.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.734
And I'm her mother.
Who are you, dear?

11:09.802 --> 11:11.929
- Jenna Ryan.
- Oh, hello, dear.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.564
L-I thought this was
her dressing room.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.370
It is. It was.
I'm her understudy.

11:17.443 --> 11:18.438
Can I help you?

11:18.473 --> 11:20.037
Yeah, we're just here
to pick up her stuff.

11:20.112 --> 11:23.206
Oh, sure.
Oh, I put them right here.

11:23.282 --> 11:25.273
Here you go.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.018
You couldn't fold them?

11:29.088 --> 11:31.318
Look, I know you're Gail's family,

11:31.390 --> 11:34.086
but it's very hard
for me to be sympathetic.

11:34.160 --> 11:37.527
- I just came from Hal Duncan's wake.
- Gail didn't do it.

11:37.596 --> 11:40.030
I'm sorry.

11:40.099 --> 11:43.398
You're right. She's innocent
until proven guilty.

11:43.469 --> 11:45.562
I guess I'm a little nervous.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.902
I have a show on Friday.
It's my opening night.

11:47.973 --> 11:51.340
I want you to know
I wanted this part,

11:51.410 --> 11:53.742
but I never wanted to get it like this.

11:53.813 --> 11:57.977
Yeah.
Look, my boss...

11:58.050 --> 12:00.883
Uh, my associate and I
are working with the police.

12:00.953 --> 12:03.319
We'd like to ask you
a couple questions.

12:03.389 --> 12:07.985
I'm kind of busy.
Um, how about tomorrow?

12:08.060 --> 12:10.119
2:00.
Come by the apartment.

12:10.196 --> 12:13.131
- 3198 Green Village Road.
- Fine. We'll be there.

12:13.199 --> 12:15.326
Great.

12:18.771 --> 12:21.137
Um... Uh, Jenna?

12:21.207 --> 12:24.608
- Yes?
- Break a leg.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.417
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

12:32.485 --> 12:35.249
Uh, I was just... Nothing.
Hey, don't fiddle with the props.

12:35.321 --> 12:39.971
I've got to know where these are, in
the dark, by touch, at a moment's notice.

12:40.226 --> 12:43.195
I've been juggling props for 44 years.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.196
Ask me about
the first prop I ever bought.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.495
- What was the...
- The sword Richard Burton used in Camelot.

12:48.567 --> 12:52.469
- I had to go to Scotland to get it.
- Really? Wow.

12:52.538 --> 12:54.506
I'm, uh, I'm Adrian Monk,
and this is Sh...

12:56.442 --> 12:58.467
She's usually right here.

12:58.544 --> 13:00.944
This is a terrible week, I'll bet.

13:01.013 --> 13:04.210
Hey, that wasn't my fault. The cops
had me under the lights all night long.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.150
I told them...
I put the prop knife on the set.

13:07.219 --> 13:11.053
We use two knives on this show.
A real one and one like this.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.784
Hey, whoa...

13:12.858 --> 13:16.089
Don't wet yourself.
The blade retracts into the handle.

13:16.162 --> 13:18.858
Gail must have switched the gag knife
for the real one before the show.

13:18.931 --> 13:21.195
- May I?
- See?

13:21.267 --> 13:24.065
It doesn't feel like
a real knife at all, does it?

13:24.136 --> 13:27.333
No - She had to know she
was holding a real knife.

13:27.406 --> 13:31.069
What happened onstage Sunday
night, that was no accident.

13:31.143 --> 13:35.739
That was a woman scorned.
"Hell hath no fury," right?

13:35.815 --> 13:39.546
And you're sure you put
a fake knife on the stage?

13:39.618 --> 13:42.587
I swear, I put it there myself,
half an hour before curtain.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.749
- And there was nobody else here?
- Nope. Except Jenna.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.352
Jenna Ryan, Gail's understudy.
She was checking in.

13:49.428 --> 13:51.919
They check in before the show,
see if anybody's sick.

13:51.997 --> 13:55.125
We're all set.
It's killing me that we can't see her.

13:55.201 --> 13:57.829
She's not allowed any visitors
until after the bail hearing.

13:57.903 --> 13:59.837
I can't believe this is happening.

13:59.905 --> 14:02.082
There's nothing we can do today.

14:02.222 --> 14:05.539
- Let's get a manicure.
- A manicure - Come on. It'll be fun.

14:05.611 --> 14:08.341
If we just go home,
we're gonna go crazy.

14:08.414 --> 14:09.922
There's a salon around the corner...

14:09.923 --> 14:11.975
Alberta's. All the ladies
in the show go there.

14:12.051 --> 14:13.675
What do you say?

14:15.337 --> 14:18.352
Nothing, nothing, noth...
Hold on. Hold on.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.415
No. Nothing.
Saturday, nothing.

14:20.492 --> 14:23.586
Ouch. I don't have an opening
for another two weeks. I'm sorry.

14:23.662 --> 14:27.098
- Not even for a manicure?
- Don't you have any cancellations?

14:27.166 --> 14:29.794
Well, Luna can put you
on the waiting list,

14:29.869 --> 14:31.803
but, uh, why don't you
try Scissor Wiz?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.357
- They'll take anyone.
- Excuse me.

14:33.392 --> 14:36.604
Uh, Jenna Ryan...
Is she a customer?

14:36.675 --> 14:38.768
Yes. - Gail's understudy.

14:38.844 --> 14:41.745
Right. She has an appointment
for tomorrow.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.305
So? She wants to
look good for her debut.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.317
But-But look.
According to this,

14:46.385 --> 14:48.319
she made this appointment
two weeks ago.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.321
How did she know she'd be onstage?

14:50.389 --> 14:53.324
I don't know. Coincidence?

14:53.392 --> 14:55.383
- Maybe.
- So what are you saying?

14:55.461 --> 14:57.861
I'm saying you might be right.

14:57.930 --> 15:00.558
Your sister may have been framed.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.568
And I think the understudy could
have had something to do with it.

15:05.371 --> 15:08.101
Who did your perm?
I-I absolutely love it.

15:12.278 --> 15:13.624
Captain Stottlemeyer,

15:13.659 --> 15:15.975
you have been investigating the
violent murder of Hal Duncan?

15:16.048 --> 15:19.484
- That's correct.
- Look at her. She's lost weight.

15:19.551 --> 15:22.577
- How can you tell from here?
- I can tell.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.520
- And who is that suspect?
- Miss Gail Fleming.

15:24.590 --> 15:28.424
Um... Uh, may I say something?

15:28.494 --> 15:31.952
Your Honor, in my opinion,
Miss Fleming is not a flight risk.

15:32.031 --> 15:34.795
You see, I know her family,
I work with her sister...

15:34.867 --> 15:38.928
Your Honor, there is an avalanche
of evidence against Miss Fleming.

15:39.004 --> 15:40.614
I hardly know where to begin.

15:40.649 --> 15:43.641
She had motive, she was obsessed
with the victim,

15:43.709 --> 15:46.769
the attack was witnessed by 300 people.

15:46.845 --> 15:48.779
Excuse me, Your Honor.

15:48.847 --> 15:51.714
I would also like to mention that I have
a consultant working on the case.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.945
He's a former homicide detective.

15:54.019 --> 15:56.783
He's somebody
I respect a great deal,

15:56.855 --> 16:00.951
and, um, he has serious doubts
about what happened.

16:01.026 --> 16:04.325
What is his name?

16:04.396 --> 16:08.025
Adrian Monk, Your Honor.
He's, uh, in the courtroom,

16:08.100 --> 16:11.035
uh, and he's ready
and willing to testify.

16:11.103 --> 16:14.197
Oh, yes.
I know Mr. Monk.

16:14.273 --> 16:18.175
- Hello, Adrian.
- Your Honor.

16:19.645 --> 16:23.911
I, uh, presided over his last
competency hearing.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.713
He couldn't testify
until I adjusted my robe.

16:26.785 --> 16:28.980
- I remember. Right.
- You see, it had to be even.

16:29.054 --> 16:31.579
- Perfectly even.
- Uh, look, Your Honor...

16:31.657 --> 16:34.888
I know he's a little unorthodox,
but he's a great cop.

16:34.960 --> 16:39.158
I'm refusing this petition.
Bail is denied.

16:39.231 --> 16:41.859
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- The court is in recess.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.300
Gail, baby...

16:44.370 --> 16:46.770
Oh, no. I'm her mother.
Can't I just talk to her?

16:46.839 --> 16:49.000
Give ya a minute.

16:49.074 --> 16:52.942
- Mom, I didn't do anything wrong.
- I know you didn't, honey.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.181
Gail, do you remember when
you were in the second grade

16:54.216 --> 16:55.674
and Pogo got sick?

16:55.748 --> 16:58.683
- Do you remember what I said?
- You said you'd make it better.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.845
I gave you a promise.
I said he'd get better, and what happened?

17:01.920 --> 17:03.512
- He got better.
- That's right.

17:03.589 --> 17:06.455
- Until the bus hit him three weeks later.
- No, no. Forget about the bus.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.858
The point is, he wasn't sick.
Now, listen to me, pumpkin.

17:09.928 --> 17:14.455
I'm making you another promise,
and I'm gonna take care of this.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.933
We gotta go.

17:17.002 --> 17:19.029
It's going to be okay.

17:25.144 --> 17:27.078
I'm depending on you.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.614
I'll do whatever it takes.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.709
I'm depending on you too.

17:44.329 --> 17:46.192
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah, we're here,

17:46.227 --> 17:48.482
uh, for Jenna Ryan.
She's expecting us.

17:48.517 --> 17:51.395
Miss Ryan just left 10 minutes ago.

17:51.470 --> 17:54.098
- Are you sure?
- I put her in the cab myself.

17:55.407 --> 17:58.433
Okay, she didn't forget. I saw her
write it down. She's avoiding us.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.671
Did you happen to hear
where she went?

18:01.342 --> 18:03.482
It's possible.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.507
Well-Well, where did she go?
It's very important.

18:05.584 --> 18:09.020
Isn't it funny?
I-I can't quite remember.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.852
I get it.
I get it. I get it.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.825
Memories are funny things.

18:14.893 --> 18:18.294
Uh, maybe this will help.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.924
Three dollars?
Hey, buddy,

18:22.000 --> 18:25.163
I get three bucks
for holding a door open.

18:25.237 --> 18:27.831
He wants more.
Give him more.

18:27.906 --> 18:31.672
He didn't do anything. I think three
dollars is more than appropriate.

18:31.743 --> 18:34.473
Give him more.

18:36.248 --> 18:39.240
- Oh, so we're up to four dollars now.
- For 20 seconds of your time.

18:39.318 --> 18:44.119
- I think that's not too shabby.
- You're the cheapest man I know.

18:44.189 --> 18:46.282
Here. Where'd she go?

18:46.358 --> 18:48.849
- What are you doing? Forty dollars?
- My sister's on death row.

18:48.927 --> 18:51.657
I think she's worth 40 dollars.
Where'd she go?

18:51.730 --> 18:55.564
- The Beltram Hotel on Ridgedale.
- Okay. Thank you very much.

18:58.537 --> 19:01.005
Excuse me. Could I have
my four dollars back?

19:01.073 --> 19:03.940
What? - We gave you 44 dollars.

19:04.009 --> 19:06.842
Yeah? - The bribe was only 40,
so, you know...

19:06.912 --> 19:09.608
- Are you for real?
- Will you come on?

19:09.681 --> 19:13.139
O-Okay. Okay, but we have
a four-dollar credit on any future bribes.

19:13.218 --> 19:16.915
I won't forget.
I'm writing it down.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.724
There she is.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.059
Oh, excuse me.
Have we registered? - Uh, for what?

19:30.135 --> 19:31.873
Speedy Dates.
We do it here once a month

19:31.908 --> 19:33.820
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I read an article about this.

19:33.855 --> 19:35.770
It's for singles. Instead of spending
all night with one jerk,

19:35.805 --> 19:37.476
you get to meet 15 jerks at once.

19:37.511 --> 19:39.637
Yeah, that's not exactly how
we would describe it.

19:39.711 --> 19:41.176
You spend four minutes with each person.

19:41.211 --> 19:44.705
Then when the love bell rings,
you move on to the next person.

19:44.783 --> 19:46.978
- It's like square dancing.
- He'll do it.

19:47.052 --> 19:49.145
Sign in. - What?

19:49.221 --> 19:53.180
Sign in. It's perfect.
This way, Jenna has to talk to you.

19:53.258 --> 19:55.658
"Speedy Dates"?
No. No, no, no.

19:55.727 --> 19:58.093
That's like Dante's
seventh circle of hell.

19:58.163 --> 20:01.564
Adrian,
"whatever it takes."

20:01.633 --> 20:03.624
Isn't that what you said?

20:09.942 --> 20:11.739
I like your eyes.

20:11.810 --> 20:14.938
Well, thank you.
They came with the face.

20:15.013 --> 20:18.380
- And you're a cop?
- Uh, used to be.

20:18.450 --> 20:20.384
Do you still have your handcuffs?

20:20.452 --> 20:22.716
Yes.
They're in my bureau.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.455
Maybe you'd like to
show them to me sometime.

20:26.525 --> 20:28.459
Why?

20:28.527 --> 20:31.553
They're-They're just handcuffs.

20:32.864 --> 20:36.898
And Trudy and I were married for...

20:37.051 --> 20:39.724
- seven years.
- I am so sorry.

20:39.759 --> 20:41.607
It was a car bomb.

20:41.642 --> 20:45.304
Three pounds of plastic explosives
under the driver's seat.

20:45.377 --> 20:49.279
I... I felt responsible.
I think it was meant for me.

20:49.348 --> 20:53.682
And how about you?
Have you ever been married?

20:55.320 --> 20:59.120
It's so hard for women my age
to meet men. I'm 38.

20:59.191 --> 21:02.957
Oh, no, you're not.
Excuse me?

21:03.028 --> 21:05.792
I was standing behind you
when you were registering out front.

21:05.864 --> 21:09.664
I-I noticed that your credit card
said "member since 1979."

21:09.735 --> 21:13.034
You have to be 18
to get that card.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.131
Which means that, uh,
you're at least 42.

21:16.208 --> 21:20.453
All right. I'm 43.
Are you happy now?

21:20.712 --> 21:22.907
You don't look it.

21:25.083 --> 21:29.110
- I hate dating, don't you?
- I don't know. I never date.

21:29.187 --> 21:31.451
Then what are you doing here?

21:31.523 --> 21:35.050
I'm... I'm just here to meet her.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.186
Oh, I see.

21:37.262 --> 21:39.787
Sorry I wasted your time.
It's okay.

21:41.233 --> 21:44.464
Hello, Adrian.
I'm Jenna.

21:44.536 --> 21:46.800
Jenna, hello.
Is this your first time?

21:46.872 --> 21:49.466
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
How about you?

21:49.541 --> 21:51.475
Third.
Insane, isn't it?

21:51.543 --> 21:53.636
But I don't know how else
to meet anybody.

21:53.712 --> 21:55.703
The only guys I meet
at work are actors.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.715
Oh, you're an actress?

21:57.783 --> 21:59.910
- Guilty.
- Are you famous?

21:59.985 --> 22:03.853
No. Not yet.
Are you into the theater?

22:03.922 --> 22:05.382
I really don't get out much.

22:05.417 --> 22:08.416
I'm in a play at the El Portal,
if you're interested.

22:08.493 --> 22:12.395
- It's called Blood on the Moon.
- Oh, I heard about that.

22:12.464 --> 22:14.932
Didn't a guy get killed
during the show?

22:15.000 --> 22:18.458
It's not exactly
the kind of publicity we wanted.

22:18.537 --> 22:21.734
Actually, I'm the understudy
for the girl who, you know, did it.

22:21.807 --> 22:24.605
- Really?
- My daddy always said,

22:24.676 --> 22:27.907
"When opportunity knocks,
just kick down the damn door.

22:27.979 --> 22:31.415
- Don't ask any questions."
- Is-Is your father an actor too?

22:31.483 --> 22:34.919
He wanted to be.
Raised by a frustrated actor.

22:34.986 --> 22:37.079
That explains everything, right?

22:37.155 --> 22:41.251
But he's great. He's really great.
My father would do anything for me.

22:41.326 --> 22:44.784
Were you there when-when
Mr. Duncan was stabbed?

22:44.863 --> 22:48.196
No. I, um...
I had checked in earlier.

22:48.266 --> 22:50.720
I was at a party across town.

22:51.796 --> 22:53.134
How did you know his name?

22:54.639 --> 22:57.631
- It's on the news.
- Uh-huh.

22:57.709 --> 23:00.303
So you didn't actually see the attack?

23:00.379 --> 23:03.871
No, I was at a party across town.
I told you.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.711
You ask a lot of questions.

23:07.786 --> 23:09.777
You never told me
what you do for a living.

23:09.855 --> 23:13.450
Oh, that was quick.
Can I see you again?

23:13.525 --> 23:16.653
I don't think so.

23:22.134 --> 23:24.500
- So how'd it go, stud?
- She did it.

23:24.569 --> 23:27.060
I don't know how she did it,
but she did it.

23:27.139 --> 23:30.416
Let's go back to the theater
and look around. - Okay.

23:31.237 --> 23:32.958
- So how did the dating go?
- Oh, it was terrible.

23:32.993 --> 23:37.446
- Thank God I'm not single.
- You are single.

23:37.516 --> 23:39.450
Oh, yeah.

23:43.555 --> 23:46.524
Okay. I think I remember
exactly what I saw.

23:46.591 --> 23:49.424
It's the second scene.
You're Gail, I'm the guy.

23:49.494 --> 23:53.521
The two knives are on the counter.
This is very important.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.294
This is the real knife.
This is the prop knife.

23:56.368 --> 23:59.462
So when you stab me,
please use the prop knife.

23:59.538 --> 24:03.599
- I'll try to remember.
- Okay. Okay, now, so.

24:03.675 --> 24:07.702
- You... You enter from the right.
- You mean the left. That's stage left.

24:07.779 --> 24:11.681
- But it's on the right. - But it's
stage left. That's what they call it.

24:11.750 --> 24:12.849
My sister's an actress.

24:12.884 --> 24:16.244
But-But for the purposes
of this recreation,

24:16.321 --> 24:18.653
let's just call it what they call it
on planet Earth.

24:18.723 --> 24:21.521
- Like you would know.
- All right. Just enter from over there.

24:21.593 --> 24:25.893
All right? Over there, and then come
walk to the table when I say "Go."

24:25.964 --> 24:27.898
And... Go.

24:36.208 --> 24:39.871
Hey, Cuz.
Did you miss me?

24:39.945 --> 24:42.277
I hope you don't mind.

24:42.347 --> 24:44.338
I let myself in.

24:47.120 --> 24:50.044
- You're pretty good.
- Oh. I have my moments.

24:50.121 --> 24:52.351
So now you say,
"Burt, you're supposed to be in jail."

24:52.424 --> 24:53.891
Come on. Say it.

24:53.959 --> 24:57.258
- Burt, you're supposed to be in jail.
- Yeah, it's funny about that phrase,

24:57.329 --> 24:59.456
"supposed to be."

24:59.531 --> 25:02.762
I'm supposed to be in jail.
You're supposed to be waiting for me.

25:02.834 --> 25:07.271
A man can't count on
"supposed to be" the way he used to.

25:09.908 --> 25:14.106
Your husband's downtown,
drowning himself in scotch and soda.

25:14.179 --> 25:18.343
I saw him leave here
about an hour ago.

25:18.416 --> 25:20.611
What are you doing?

25:22.260 --> 25:25.054
Well done. Very nice.

25:25.123 --> 25:28.581
- Sorry. We thought we were alone.
- I was in the shadows,

25:28.660 --> 25:30.594
where the director belongs.

25:30.662 --> 25:32.596
I'm Karl Sebastian.

25:32.664 --> 25:35.895
I'm Sharona Fleming,
and this is Adrian Monk.

25:35.967 --> 25:39.232
- You're Gail's sister, aren't you?
- Yeah.

25:39.304 --> 25:41.568
Will you tell her
we're all praying for her?

25:41.640 --> 25:45.269
I've known Gail many years,
and I still can't believe what's happened.

25:45.343 --> 25:47.607
It's like a bad dream. - Sure is.

25:47.679 --> 25:50.671
How do you know the play, Mr. Monk?
It's brand-new. It's never been published.

25:50.749 --> 25:52.613
I saw it last week, and, uh,

25:52.648 --> 25:55.584
must have memorized it
by accident. Sorry.

25:55.654 --> 25:58.418
You memorized it
after seeing it one time?

25:58.490 --> 26:00.958
I'm so sorry.

26:01.026 --> 26:03.221
I know this is all last-minute.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.229
I don't know what
your schedule is, but, uh,

26:05.297 --> 26:07.697
we've just hired an actor from New York
to play the part of Burt.

26:07.766 --> 26:11.258
But he can't be here till Monday.
Would you consider filling in?

26:11.336 --> 26:14.635
It's only two shows. - Me? No. No.

26:14.706 --> 26:17.698
- Uh, no. Sorry. Can't.
- He'll do it. He'll be great.

26:17.776 --> 26:22.339
I just need to talk to my agent
for one minute.

26:23.148 --> 26:25.105
Are you insane? I can't act!

26:25.140 --> 26:28.216
Look, my sister's in trouble.
You said the understudy did it.

26:28.251 --> 26:31.144
She's in the show.
That's where you should be.

26:31.222 --> 26:33.816
It's two shows.
Come on.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.187
- He'll do it.
- Oh, excellent. I'm thrilled.

26:38.263 --> 26:42.222
Welcome aboard. We'll, uh,
see you tomorrow, 10:00 a. m. Rehearsal.

26:42.300 --> 26:46.871
- You're in the show Friday night.
- In the show. I'm in the show.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.872
It's fantastic.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.971
Okay, from the top of scene two.

26:54.045 --> 26:57.412
Adrian, you've just
escaped from prison.

26:57.482 --> 27:01.248
You're hiding behind the door.

27:01.319 --> 27:04.288
You step out, and, uh...

27:04.356 --> 27:06.449
Anytime, Mr. Monk.

27:16.501 --> 27:19.732
Hey, Cuz.
Did you miss me?

27:19.804 --> 27:22.432
I hope you don't mind.
I let myself in.

27:22.507 --> 27:27.069
Okay, okay. Um, Adrian,
you started to have it yesterday.

27:27.145 --> 27:30.603
Remember, you've escaped
from prison. - Right. I s... Yeah.

27:30.682 --> 27:33.776
Full of rage. You swagger.

27:33.852 --> 27:36.184
I don't think so.

27:36.254 --> 27:39.087
Hi.! I'm sorry.!
I'm sorry I'm late.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.284
I couldn't get a cab.

27:42.727 --> 27:45.696
- You...
- Jenna Ryan, this is Adrian Monk.

27:45.764 --> 27:48.961
- He's filling in for a couple of shows.
- You're an actor?

27:49.034 --> 27:53.232
Yes, he's an actor,
and he's doing a splendidjob.

27:53.304 --> 27:56.569
But we haven't got all day,
so, um, we'll go from your line,

27:56.641 --> 27:58.575
"There's money in my purse."

27:58.643 --> 28:01.305
Jenna, you're at the table.
Adrian, you're swaggering.

28:04.916 --> 28:08.750
Here. I have
some money in my purse.

28:08.820 --> 28:12.153
Take it. - You think I want
your pocket change?

28:12.223 --> 28:14.191
You think that's why I came back?

28:14.259 --> 28:17.353
Okay, now, you push the table over.

28:21.332 --> 28:24.133
You're an animal.
Just-Just push it over.

28:26.905 --> 28:30.705
Maybe my character wouldn't want to
make too big a mess right-right here.

28:30.775 --> 28:33.335
She sent you to prison.
You're... You're full of rage.!

28:33.411 --> 28:37.745
I have a thought. What if my
character expresses his rage...

28:37.816 --> 28:42.150
by putting away the groceries...

28:42.220 --> 28:43.915
roughly?

28:46.291 --> 28:48.987
Uh, okay. Uh, okay.
Uh, let's-let's move on...

28:49.060 --> 28:53.497
to your next line,
"Who ordered the tossed salad?"

28:56.401 --> 28:58.596
Who ordered the tossed salad?

29:00.939 --> 29:03.908
I'm sorry.
Is that how you laugh?

29:05.844 --> 29:09.007
- I'm not... not a big laugher.
- Well, try a real laugh.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.300
Have a go.

29:12.450 --> 29:14.941
Who ordered the tossed salad?

29:19.190 --> 29:22.626
Oh, no. Okay, wait.
Let me try that again.

29:23.962 --> 29:26.590
Who ordered the tossed salad?

29:29.300 --> 29:31.632
Sebastian?

29:31.703 --> 29:34.194
- Who ordered the tossed salad?
- He's impossible.

29:34.272 --> 29:36.137
Just cut him loose.
We'll find somebody else.

29:36.207 --> 29:41.543
It was your idea to hire Hal,
and he was terrible, God rest his soul.

29:44.048 --> 29:46.120
Who ordered the tossed...

29:46.155 --> 29:49.076
Um... Okay, we'll, uh,
we'll work on the laugh.

29:50.588 --> 29:53.580
Take 10, everybody.

29:55.293 --> 29:59.059
Oh, not quite.
Hold on.

29:59.130 --> 30:02.395
Kathleen, what did the director
mean when he said that...

30:02.467 --> 30:04.662
Jenna made them
hire Hal Duncan?

30:04.736 --> 30:08.228
It was no secret...
Jenna wanted them to hire Hal.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.159
I'll tell you what I heard:

30:09.194 --> 30:12.106
She slept with the producer, then
threatened to tell his wife unless they did.

30:12.177 --> 30:15.736
- Why? Were they dating?
- No. Nobody could figure it out.

30:15.771 --> 30:16.944
Jenna didn't even like the guy.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.744
He wasn't a great actor,
or even a good actor.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.576
He was a character.

30:23.611 --> 30:26.723
Always wore sunglasses, even inside.

30:26.791 --> 30:30.887
Oh, and he was allergic to everything:
Eggs, peanuts and shellfish.

30:30.962 --> 30:34.125
He wouldn't eat anything
unless he made it himself. Ah.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.633
This might work, huh?
What do you think?

30:38.703 --> 30:41.934
Can't I just wear my own clothes?
I'd... I'd rather wear my own clothes.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.770
Uh, what-what do you have at home?

30:46.277 --> 30:49.678
Uh, well, he just has more of this.

30:49.747 --> 30:51.738
Basically this.

30:52.750 --> 30:56.049
So, when do I get to meet
the elusive Ronnie?

30:56.120 --> 31:00.853
- Who?
- The stockbroker. I told you about him.

31:00.925 --> 31:03.189
He's at a convention... in Belgium.

31:04.261 --> 31:06.492
What stockbroker?

31:06.564 --> 31:09.397
I don't like Benjy meeting any of the
guys I date until I'm sure, you know?

31:09.467 --> 31:11.901
But you said he took Benjy
to the basketball game.

31:11.970 --> 31:13.733
No, I didn't. - Yes, you did.

31:13.805 --> 31:16.603
Well, then, you misunderstood,
or you just got mixed up.

31:16.674 --> 31:17.877
Look, Ma, can we just change
the subject, huh?

31:17.912 --> 31:19.777
You don't have to snap, honey.

31:19.812 --> 31:22.940
This is a hard time for all of us.

31:23.014 --> 31:24.982
You know, I always
thought if anyone in this

31:24.983 --> 31:27.212
family ever would end up
in jail, it would be you.

31:27.285 --> 31:30.846
You know what? That's great.
That's great. Right in front of Benjy?

31:30.922 --> 31:34.085
- I don't mind.
- No, you know what I'm talking about.

31:34.158 --> 31:38.219
- Remember when you S-T-O-L-E the car?
- Ma, he's 11 years old. He can spell.

31:38.296 --> 31:42.198
- S-T-O...
- Okay, you know what? You know what?

31:42.267 --> 31:44.167
Go to your room
and do your homework.

31:44.235 --> 31:46.203
Whatever.

31:48.573 --> 31:51.406
Oy!

31:51.476 --> 31:55.503
I'm sorry, Sharona.
I-I'm just so scared.

31:57.582 --> 32:00.551
I'm scared too.

32:08.559 --> 32:11.585
- How you doing?
- Oh, I'm making lots of new friends.

32:11.663 --> 32:14.188
I need you to get me out
before I make any more.

32:14.265 --> 32:15.993
Listen, your Mom and
Sharona wanted to come,

32:16.028 --> 32:17.894
but you're only allowed one visitor a day.

32:17.969 --> 32:20.267
They wanted me to ask you
if you needed anything.

32:20.338 --> 32:21.828
Yeah, an explanation
for what happened.

32:21.863 --> 32:24.172
Adrian, I didn't stab anybody.

32:24.242 --> 32:26.403
I grabbed the prop knife.
I'm sure of it.

32:26.477 --> 32:29.173
The knife they found... my prints
weren't on it, were they?

32:29.247 --> 32:31.340
No. No, no.
There were no...

32:31.416 --> 32:34.681
There were no usable prints.

32:34.752 --> 32:37.619
The, uh... The police
figure that you, uh,

32:37.689 --> 32:39.623
that you wiped them off
in all the confusion.

32:39.691 --> 32:43.092
Nobody believes me.
My lawyer thinks I'm crazy.

32:43.161 --> 32:47.120
Well, maybe I am. - No.

32:47.198 --> 32:50.133
- No, you're not crazy.
- Do you want to try a different phone?

32:50.201 --> 32:52.829
No. No, no. I'm good.
I'm good.

32:52.904 --> 32:56.567
Listen, Gail, what do you know
about your understudy, Jenna Ryan?

32:56.641 --> 32:59.132
I can't believe you said that.
I've been thinking about her.

32:59.210 --> 33:03.306
Why is that? - Because Jenna
would do anything for that part.

33:03.381 --> 33:06.407
Four years ago, she tried this
Tonya Harding thing on another actress.

33:06.484 --> 33:10.113
I think it was in Chicago.
They were both up for the same part.

33:10.188 --> 33:14.750
The actress was attacked with a golf club.
Broke her kneecap. - Really?

33:14.826 --> 33:16.228
Yeah. Jenna got the part.

33:16.263 --> 33:18.626
You know, everyone suspected her,
but they couldn't prove anything.

33:18.696 --> 33:21.859
But, you know, she couldn't have done it.
She wasn't even near the theater,

33:21.933 --> 33:24.458
and she was at some party
across town, so...

33:24.535 --> 33:26.435
Maybe.

33:26.504 --> 33:28.995
There. There.

33:29.073 --> 33:32.201
Oh, God, the time.
I've got to go. I've got a show.

33:32.276 --> 33:35.609
- Are you really in the cast?
- A star is born.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.547
God, I would have thought
you'd get stage fright.

33:37.582 --> 33:39.673
Nah, I was fine in the rehearsals.

33:39.751 --> 33:42.219
Everyone's fine in rehearsals.
There's no audience there.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.782
That's true.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.553
That's true.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.259
My mom's in the front row.

33:59.294 --> 34:01.566
But there's not too many other
people out there, right?

34:01.639 --> 34:03.402
No, there's lots
of people out there. - Oh!

34:03.474 --> 34:07.274
It's sold out. Well, don't worry about it.
You were fine in rehearsals.

34:07.345 --> 34:12.442
- Don't worry about it. - This is it!
Places everyone. Energy. Energy!

34:12.516 --> 34:14.985
I heard you've been asking
around about me. - What?

34:15.053 --> 34:18.580
Who are you? You're not an actor.
That much I know.

34:18.656 --> 34:20.920
Okay, Jenna. Your entrance
is on the other side.

34:20.992 --> 34:23.755
- We know a few things too.
- What's that supposed to mean?

34:23.828 --> 34:25.420
Figure it out.

34:25.496 --> 34:28.954
Henry, you just sit there.

34:29.033 --> 34:31.159
You read those baseball scores.

34:31.235 --> 34:34.068
Don't let me bother you, huh?

34:34.138 --> 34:37.699
Where's that girl? She was supposed to be
back here an hour ago with the groceries.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.639
- Okay.
- Dinner's gonna be late tonight.

34:39.710 --> 34:42.907
Okay. Okay, I... I-I-I can't do this.

34:42.980 --> 34:46.438
- Tell them I'm out of town.
- It won't work. They've all seen you.

34:48.018 --> 34:50.748
What was I thinking?
I'm not an actor.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.949
Are you all right?

34:54.458 --> 34:55.938
What are you doing?
What-What are you doing?

34:55.973 --> 34:58.395
Taking your pulse. I'm a nurse, remember?

35:01.766 --> 35:05.964
Oh, my God.
Sharona, I've... I've got it.

35:06.037 --> 35:08.528
I know how she did it. - You do?

35:08.606 --> 35:10.875
If that's how you take
someone's pulse,

35:10.910 --> 35:13.105
I know how she did it.

35:13.177 --> 35:16.544
Adrian, let's go. You're on!
You. Come here!

35:30.828 --> 35:33.888
- How did she do it?
- Allergies.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.163
Hal Duncan had lots of allergies.

35:35.198 --> 35:38.095
The wardrobe lady said he was afraid to
eat anything he didn't make himself.

35:38.169 --> 35:42.196
That's why Jenna wanted him in that part.
He was the perfect patsy!

35:42.273 --> 35:47.040
The prop master told me that Jenna was
hanging out onstage before the show.

35:47.111 --> 35:50.240
But she wasn't switching knives,
she was tampering with the apples.

35:50.275 --> 35:51.716
The apples?

35:51.751 --> 35:54.241
She must have been putting
something on them or in them...

35:54.318 --> 35:57.344
something that Hal Duncan
was allergic to.

35:57.421 --> 36:00.515
That's right.
My mom said they tasted funny.

36:00.591 --> 36:01.747
Like I said,

36:03.628 --> 36:06.096
I'm here for what's mine!

36:07.632 --> 36:11.898
Hal Duncan wasn't stabbed.
He was having an allergic reaction.

36:14.372 --> 36:17.398
But he was stabbed.
There was a real knife in his chest.

36:17.475 --> 36:20.638
I know. I-I know, I know.
It was a brilliant plan.

36:20.711 --> 36:22.611
- You're still here?
- What? - You're on!

36:22.680 --> 36:25.308
- No. No, no, no.
- Adrian, Adrian, if you don't go onstage,

36:25.383 --> 36:28.181
she's gonna know something's up.

36:28.252 --> 36:29.947
Sharona, go downstairs,
check her dressing room!

36:30.021 --> 36:31.030
What am I looking for?

36:31.065 --> 36:33.252
Evidence! Something
Hal Duncan was allergic to.

36:33.324 --> 36:34.916
Shellfish, eggs, peanuts...

36:52.076 --> 36:54.510
Hey, Cuz.

36:54.579 --> 36:56.547
Did you miss me?

37:19.937 --> 37:22.428
I hope you don't mind.

37:22.506 --> 37:25.202
I let myself in.

37:25.276 --> 37:27.642
Burt, you're supposed to be in jail.

37:29.180 --> 37:33.310
Funny, that phrase,
"supposed to be."

37:39.257 --> 37:41.191
You're supposed to be in jail.

37:42.893 --> 37:45.885
I'm supposed to be in jail.

37:45.963 --> 37:49.490
You're supposed to be
waiting for me.

37:52.270 --> 37:56.331
A man can't count on
"used to be"...

37:56.407 --> 37:58.341
the way he's supposed to.

37:58.409 --> 38:01.401
Yes, yes. We can prove it.
Look, are you almost here?

38:01.479 --> 38:03.709
- Great. I'll see you soon.
- You'd better go.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.908
My husband's upstairs.
If he hears you...

38:05.983 --> 38:08.781
Your husband's downtown,

38:08.853 --> 38:12.050
drowning himself
in scotch and soda.

38:12.123 --> 38:17.288
I saw him leave here
about an hour ago.

38:20.298 --> 38:24.132
I have money in my purse.
Here, take it.

38:24.201 --> 38:27.193
- You think I want your pocket change?
- Adrian!

38:27.271 --> 38:30.297
You think that's why I came back?

38:33.511 --> 38:37.242
Adrian. Adrian!

38:39.283 --> 38:42.741
Look.! Adrian.! Adrian.

38:52.830 --> 38:57.290
Who ordered the tossed salad?

39:00.838 --> 39:03.033
Oh, my God.

39:03.107 --> 39:04.938
I'm here for what's mine.

39:05.009 --> 39:08.103
Burt, if you don't leave, I'll...

39:08.179 --> 39:12.685
You'll what? Huh?
You'll do nothin'!

39:14.552 --> 39:18.921
- Adrian, be careful! She knows!
- Like I said,

39:18.989 --> 39:20.581
- I came for what's mine!
- Watch out!

39:23.027 --> 39:24.619
Oh, my God!

39:41.178 --> 39:43.373
Is she all right?

39:43.447 --> 39:44.977
Is there a doctor in the house?

39:45.012 --> 39:47.213
Everybody stay in your seats,
ladies and gentlemen.

39:47.284 --> 39:49.996
- I'm a police officer. Everything is under
control. - Are you okay? - I'm all right.

39:50.031 --> 39:52.287
Everybody just sit down.

39:52.356 --> 39:54.415
Could we have
the house lights on, please?

39:54.492 --> 39:56.983
She's okay.
I'll call an ambulance.

39:58.095 --> 40:00.928
Excuse me. Did you...

40:00.998 --> 40:03.309
Did you just ask if there was
a doctor in the house?

40:03.344 --> 40:04.365
Yes. Yes. Right.

40:04.435 --> 40:08.462
That's funny. Because last week,
you were the doctor in the house.

40:10.708 --> 40:14.804
- What are you talking about?
- I was here. I saw you.

40:14.879 --> 40:17.473
Is there a doctor in the house?
Anyone? - I'm a doctor.

40:17.548 --> 40:19.345
But you're not a doctor, are you?

40:19.417 --> 40:22.909
I remembered how you took
Hal's pulse after he collapsed.

40:22.987 --> 40:27.253
You used your thumb, something
no real doctor would ever do.

40:27.324 --> 40:31.283
Hal Duncan was having
an allergic reaction to peanut oil.

40:31.362 --> 40:33.592
He wasn't stabbed...

40:33.664 --> 40:35.928
until you stabbed him.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.547
When you leaned over,
you pocketed the fake knife,

40:38.582 --> 40:39.904
and then you killed him.

40:39.939 --> 40:42.338
He's dead.
He's been stabbed!

40:44.475 --> 40:46.568
That's crazy. Why would I...

40:46.644 --> 40:49.875
You would do anything
to help Jenna get into the play.

40:49.947 --> 40:52.814
It's a big hit, heading to New York,

40:52.883 --> 40:55.044
and a career-making role
for your daughter.

40:56.320 --> 40:59.255
- My daughter?
- That's right, Mr. Ryan.

40:59.323 --> 41:02.417
That is your name, isn't it?
You've been obsessed with her career.

41:04.128 --> 41:09.225
Jenna told me all about it.
We... We dated, briefly.

41:09.300 --> 41:13.396
You don't understand.
Jenna's all I have.

41:13.471 --> 41:17.430
But if they wanted Gail out of the way,
why didn't they just go after her?

41:17.508 --> 41:18.426
They couldn't do that, Captain.

41:18.461 --> 41:22.571
Jenna was suspected of attacking
another actress four years ago.

41:22.646 --> 41:24.580
They couldn't pull that trick again.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.990
They had to find another
way to get rid of Gail.

41:27.025 --> 41:30.879
- So they framed her.
- Or they tried to. Thank you, Adrian.

41:30.955 --> 41:33.150
Now, can you prove any of this?

41:33.224 --> 41:35.435
The medical examiner can.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.261
This was in her dressing room.

41:38.329 --> 41:41.662
I'm sure you can still find
traces of it in his body.

41:41.732 --> 41:46.431
- Peanut oil.
- Daddy! Daddy, what did you do?

41:46.504 --> 41:50.099
I had nothing to do with this,
I swear! I swear!

41:50.174 --> 41:52.233
Shut up, bitch!
Show's over.

41:52.309 --> 41:55.073
That's my daughter, the detective.!

42:00.351 --> 42:03.479
Bravo!

42:23.040 --> 42:25.531
Listen to this.
"The director said,

42:25.609 --> 42:29.875
"'We're all excited about Gail
Fleming rejoining the show. - Yea!

42:29.947 --> 42:32.662
"'We're also hoping to bring
our newest cast member,

42:32.697 --> 42:34.611
Adrian Monk, to New York with us.

42:34.685 --> 42:37.715
In all my years in the theater,
I have never seen fear and panic

42:37.750 --> 42:39.356
portrayed so convincingly."'

42:39.391 --> 42:43.520
That is a money review.
First time out. Congratulations. - Thanks.

42:43.594 --> 42:45.687
Are you gonna be doing
any more acting, Mr. Monk?

42:45.763 --> 42:48.698
Anything's possible, Benjy,
except for that.

42:48.766 --> 42:51.758
Oh, I'm gonna miss my plane.
We better call a taxi.

42:51.835 --> 42:54.099
Oh, no, I'll take you. You know,
I've been cooped up all week.

42:54.171 --> 42:56.511
Before I leave, I want a picture
with me and my girls.

42:56.546 --> 42:57.402
Oh, I'll... I'll take it for you.

42:57.474 --> 42:58.510
Oh, no, don't give it to him.

42:58.545 --> 43:00.307
He'll spend half an hour
cleaning the lens. Don't.

43:00.377 --> 43:04.108
Oh, well, we can all be in it,
because, uh, there's a built-in timer.

43:04.181 --> 43:06.741
But we have to be careful.
There's just one picture left.

43:06.817 --> 43:09.479
Ready? Go! Smile!

43:14.992 --> 43:16.960
Here, Cheryl, you switch
with me, okay? - Adrian, no.

43:17.027 --> 43:19.825
- No. There's no time.
- Mom should be in the middle.

43:19.897 --> 43:22.127
Okay, okay. Wait. Smile.

43:22.199 --> 43:24.565
- Gail, you switch...
- Oh, come on. We don't have time for this!

43:24.635 --> 43:27.604
Quick, quick!
Yeah, now it's better.

43:27.671 --> 43:30.299
Cause you have tall, short, tall, short.
