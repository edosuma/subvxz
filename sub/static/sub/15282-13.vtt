00:00.570 --> 00:03.160
{\a6}South Philadelphia
PENNSYLVANIA

00:01.160 --> 00:03.520
Bid is 150. Do I have 200?

00:06.490 --> 00:08.700
A lot of stuff in
this unit, people.

00:11.240 --> 00:13.060
Do I hear 3?

00:13.070 --> 00:15.170
- 300
- Stu,what are you doing?

00:15.180 --> 00:15.990
Making my move.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.500
You said 250 was the cutoff.

00:18.510 --> 00:22.020
300, going once... twice...

00:22.030 --> 00:23.220
350!

00:23.907 --> 00:25.360
Leave it alone, stu.

00:25.370 --> 00:26.970
- 450
- Dude!

00:26.982 --> 00:29.289
Gotta show this
guy we're serious.

00:30.119 --> 00:32.368
The bid is 450. Do I hear 500?

00:32.378 --> 00:33.872
There are 3 other
units up today.

00:33.887 --> 00:35.641
I've got a feeling
about this one.

00:35.658 --> 00:37.262
450 going once...

00:37.276 --> 00:40.910
The last time you had a feeling, we
ended up with a crate of dead car
batteries and a dog bed.

00:40.945 --> 00:43.810
450 going twice...

00:44.368 --> 00:45.683
Sold. It's all yours, boys.

00:45.695 --> 00:47.701
Settle up at the office.

00:48.637 --> 00:49.930
Nice.

01:09.058 --> 01:10.800
Check it out.

01:10.818 --> 01:13.351
Cha... ching.

01:30.995 --> 01:33.600
This is like a
journal or something.

01:37.046 --> 01:39.850
Uh, dude. That is wrong.

01:39.866 --> 01:41.581
Where do you even
find stuff like that?

01:41.595 --> 01:43.282
No idea.

01:43.296 --> 01:46.022
There's gotta be a market for it,
though, right?

01:57.956 --> 02:00.763
I think we need
to call the cops.

02:10.795 --> 02:11.603
You got something?

02:11.616 --> 02:14.160
Not sure.
It's from an old storage unit.

02:14.175 --> 02:16.982
Case agent from the philly
field office sent it to me.

02:16.998 --> 02:18.290
Somebody you know?

02:18.306 --> 02:20.300
She knows me. You know.

02:20.876 --> 02:21.950
A fan.

02:21.965 --> 02:23.963
Your world's a very crowded place,
isn't it?

02:23.975 --> 02:26.011
You'd be surprised.

02:26.026 --> 02:27.942
This is detailed.

02:27.956 --> 02:30.180
Future tense.
They're fantasies.

02:30.196 --> 02:32.290
That agent thinks it
could be more than that.

02:32.306 --> 02:33.632
There's more of this?

02:33.645 --> 02:35.443
A few boxes in
the field office.

02:35.457 --> 02:37.673
I'd like to drive up there,
look at the rest of the material,

02:37.705 --> 02:40.001
make a judgment from that.

02:40.016 --> 02:41.302
Take reid with you.

02:41.315 --> 02:42.400
Road trip--nice!

02:42.415 --> 02:46.622
I've got books on tape with peter coyote
reading the entire foundation trilogy.

02:49.088 --> 02:52.181
F. B. I. ,
Field Office PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA

02:56.275 --> 02:58.503
How do you get used
to the staring?

02:59.425 --> 03:02.183
I'd feel like I perpetually have
something stuck in my teeth.

03:02.198 --> 03:03.902
You learn to ignore it.

03:05.445 --> 03:08.640
I'm not terribly interested
in what you can't do, roy.

03:08.656 --> 03:12.201
We have the best resources in the world,
one of which is supposedly you.

03:13.456 --> 03:16.400
Just--just get me that match.

03:17.476 --> 03:19.861
David rossi in my office.

03:19.876 --> 03:20.992
Somebody pinch me.

03:21.007 --> 03:22.273
You must be agent morris.

03:22.287 --> 03:23.622
Jill, please.

03:23.636 --> 03:25.512
And can I get you
anything? Coffee?

03:25.525 --> 03:29.132
Actually, if you don't mind, I'd like
for dr. Reid and I to get to this.

03:29.148 --> 03:31.652
Dr. Reid.
Thank you both for coming.

03:31.667 --> 03:32.930
You won't be disappointed.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.571
What other materials
do you have?

03:34.587 --> 03:36.991
We found assorted artwork,
torture porn, bondage.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.202
But what strikes
me is the prose.

03:39.218 --> 03:41.930
It screams of high-order
sexual predator.

03:41.946 --> 03:43.472
I think we're onto
something big.

03:43.486 --> 03:44.753
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

03:44.785 --> 03:47.051
I assume you ran the name
of whoever rented the unit.

03:47.067 --> 03:48.343
Yeah, the name was fake.

03:48.357 --> 03:50.461
Louis ivey.
There's no record of such a person.

03:50.475 --> 03:51.422
Did he pay in cash?

03:51.438 --> 03:52.641
Till he went into arrears.

03:52.655 --> 03:56.400
6 months without a payment and the owner
is allowed to auction its contents.

03:56.416 --> 03:58.971
What I've read so far suggests
an orderly personality.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.211
Not likely to miss payments.

04:01.227 --> 04:02.573
Well, he screwed up.

04:02.588 --> 04:04.752
They all do eventually, right?

04:06.435 --> 04:09.710
Maybe I will take that coffee.

05:48.797 --> 05:50.583
Well, you were in
there a long time.

05:50.597 --> 05:53.003
I wanted to look at all of it,
to be sure.

05:53.017 --> 05:54.503
And are you?

05:54.518 --> 05:56.083
No.

05:56.825 --> 05:58.793
Really?

06:01.327 --> 06:04.153
You--I would be lying if I
said I wasn't disappointed.

06:04.165 --> 06:06.491
The materials are the product
of a disturbed individual,

06:06.507 --> 06:11.883
but there's nothing there to convince me
that the person has enacted on
his fantasies.

06:13.176 --> 06:15.630
So you've come to say good-bye.

06:15.648 --> 06:17.321
I'm afraid so.

06:17.336 --> 06:21.232
We've got real cases in quantico,
cases with bodies.

06:21.248 --> 06:25.280
But if I am right about this thing,
there will be plenty of those.

06:26.876 --> 06:29.153
It was nice meeting you.

06:32.365 --> 06:35.252
There was something
else in the boxes.

06:37.088 --> 06:42.370
In eyes of a predator, you wrote that
collection of integumentary items is a
definitive precursor.

06:42.387 --> 06:45.711
Skin, nails... hair.

06:46.316 --> 06:48.611
This guy's for real.

06:56.937 --> 06:58.733
I'll call my team.

06:59.517 --> 07:01.332
We've got work to do.

07:01.747 --> 07:02.800
Great.

07:42.307 --> 07:44.600
"I know indeed what
evil I intend to do,

07:44.618 --> 07:48.101
but stronger than all my
afterthoughts is my fury,

07:48.115 --> 07:52.113
fury that brings upon
mortals the greatest evils. "

07:52.125 --> 07:53.371
Euripides.

07:53.385 --> 07:54.773
Is this everything
from the unit?

07:54.787 --> 07:59.311
No. We pulled the salient materials and
had philly P. D. Process the rest of the
items on site.

07:59.326 --> 08:00.442
What else was there?

08:00.457 --> 08:02.400
Just some books, albums, toys.

08:02.416 --> 08:03.112
Toys?

08:03.127 --> 08:05.303
Yeah. Old stuff,
like from his childhood.

08:05.316 --> 08:08.180
And we were able to lift some prints,
but afis was a bust.

08:08.195 --> 08:09.523
He's not in our system.

08:09.535 --> 08:12.743
Morgan and prentiss, go back to the unit
and see what else it can tell us about
the man.

08:12.776 --> 08:14.020
I'll get you directions.

08:14.037 --> 08:17.681
We have to establish if this guy's
taking his fantasies to the next level.

08:17.695 --> 08:21.511
We can use these materials to try to
identify his signature and connect him
to any open cases.

08:21.525 --> 08:23.871
On the surface it reads like
he wanted to try it all.

08:23.886 --> 08:26.470
I think isolating any one
aspect might be tough.

08:26.486 --> 08:27.602
Well, then dig deeper.

08:27.616 --> 08:29.802
Try linguistics.
Look for patterns in the handwriting.

08:29.818 --> 08:31.420
Rossi and I will
take the images.

08:31.436 --> 08:34.280
Find the fetish,
find the fiend.

08:37.878 --> 08:39.390
Hey, you want to make
this interesting?

08:39.606 --> 08:41.690
Best insights,
loser buys lunch.

08:41.707 --> 08:43.751
- Ooh,bring it on,girl.
- Ok.

08:44.176 --> 08:45.740
It looks like we
have a happy kid.

08:45.758 --> 08:49.403
Well-rounded, varied interests.

08:49.827 --> 08:53.101
This looks to have been drawn
at about the schematic stage.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.782
So that would make him about 6
years of age at the time, right?

08:57.315 --> 08:59.212
It's dated 1976.

08:59.227 --> 09:01.691
So that would make
him about 38 now.

09:01.706 --> 09:04.073
Kid's blond,
assuming it's autobiographical.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.000
And he's caucasian.

09:05.015 --> 09:07.632
Oh, yeah,
you hit that one on the head.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.141
But, now, here, look.

09:12.155 --> 09:15.070
Look at how the drawings
change over the years.

09:15.085 --> 09:18.531
A bright sun, a loving family,
an idyllic home.

09:18.546 --> 09:22.190
But then, the mother goes away.

09:22.488 --> 09:25.760
Maybe she leaves them,
maybe she dies.

09:25.776 --> 09:28.771
The father struggles
to make ends meet.

09:28.785 --> 09:33.440
The boy begins to withdraw,
retreating within himself.

09:35.900 --> 09:38.840
This is his turning point.

09:42.582 --> 09:46.839
So what informed his fantasies,
and when did it begin?

09:48.469 --> 09:50.768
This is the earliest
one I found--1982.

09:50.779 --> 09:53.313
It's tame in comparison
to the later stuff.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.480
Vintage.

09:54.495 --> 09:55.993
Think he was a collector ?

09:56.015 --> 09:57.660
Or it was handed down.

09:57.676 --> 09:59.541
From his father?

09:59.556 --> 10:03.370
I can still remember my dad's less
than skillfully hidden stash.

10:03.387 --> 10:07.512
But this guy graduated to harder stuff--
the torture porn. It's brutal.

10:07.526 --> 10:09.312
It brought out certain desires.

10:09.325 --> 10:11.503
The early exposure
was a trigger.

10:11.515 --> 10:14.451
When I interviewed bundy,
he had a theory about pornography.

10:14.467 --> 10:19.240
He said, if you want to stop people from
becoming like me, don't burn catcher in
the rye.

10:19.256 --> 10:21.131
Burn hustler.

10:21.147 --> 10:23.331
I read your books, too, dave.

10:23.995 --> 10:25.972
Got some textbooks in here.

10:25.987 --> 10:27.450
Engineering.

10:27.716 --> 10:29.270
Mathematics.

10:29.287 --> 10:30.421
Cad manual.

10:30.438 --> 10:31.891
Trade school.

10:32.346 --> 10:33.883
Ok, so he's in a fix-it field.

10:33.898 --> 10:35.782
Construction, home improvement.

10:35.796 --> 10:36.733
That's good.

10:36.746 --> 10:37.892
But I think I got you.

10:37.905 --> 10:40.201
Not so fast.

10:42.507 --> 10:45.412
Look at these. Dresses.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.303
What...

10:49.636 --> 10:51.262
They're different sizes.

10:51.625 --> 10:54.162
They were different sizes.

10:54.968 --> 10:56.920
They've been altered.

10:56.935 --> 10:59.341
Cross-dresser.

10:59.675 --> 11:01.990
Looks like I'm buying lunch.

11:02.556 --> 11:08.082
Extra-linguistic indicators in his
writing suggest he's most excited by the
prospect of electric shock.

11:08.095 --> 11:10.642
As a method of torture.
Be specific.

11:10.658 --> 11:12.430
When you're in a court,
the judge will demand it.

11:12.465 --> 11:13.641
See how heavy his
handwriting becomes?

11:13.677 --> 11:16.473
At times he so exhilarated,
he actually rips through the page.

11:16.487 --> 11:17.681
The idiolect
supports it as well.

11:17.716 --> 11:20.242
I mean, nowhere else is he as
creative in his descriptions.

11:20.256 --> 11:21.031
Good work.

11:21.047 --> 11:23.291
You found a signature
that's easy to track.

11:23.308 --> 11:26.420
The electrical burns on his
victims will be unmistakable.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.232
This is dana foster.

11:27.238 --> 11:30.270
She's a 34-year-old real estate
agent from the suburb of blue bell.

11:30.286 --> 11:35.890
She was murdered 5 years ago when she
went to meet a prospective buyer at a
house in bucks county.

11:36.177 --> 11:39.481
Her nude body was found in a cellar,
and she was strangled and raped.

11:39.495 --> 11:41.981
And here's the torture behavior that
reid identified from the journals.

11:42.016 --> 11:45.303
The contact wounds are burn marks, most
likely the result of electrical current.

11:45.316 --> 11:47.210
Any leads on the buyer
she went to meet?

11:47.227 --> 11:48.180
Fake name.

11:48.195 --> 11:49.513
Louis ivey.

11:49.525 --> 11:52.031
Could this guy be
any more perfect?

11:53.137 --> 11:55.113
Were her clothes
found at the scene?

11:55.127 --> 11:56.320
No. How'd you know?

11:56.336 --> 11:59.881
He takes them as souvenirs,
and he alters them to fit his own frame.

11:59.897 --> 12:00.782
So he's bisexual?

12:00.797 --> 12:03.511
Actually, most cross-dressers
are heterosexual.

12:03.527 --> 12:05.681
It's fairly common
in sexual predators.

12:05.696 --> 12:06.993
What about her hair?

12:07.006 --> 12:08.360
Was any of it missing?

12:08.378 --> 12:10.202
Not that was reported.

12:10.215 --> 12:12.460
J. J. , Contact garcia and
widen the victim search.

12:12.476 --> 12:15.282
Rossi and I will go
visit the crime scene.

12:18.936 --> 12:20.602
Boy: Watch this, daddy.

12:20.616 --> 12:22.942
Hold on, son.
Let me get the door.

12:23.968 --> 12:25.632
Mr. Overholt?

12:26.245 --> 12:27.571
I'm agent hotchner.

12:27.587 --> 12:29.352
This is agent rossi.
We're with the fbi.

12:29.367 --> 12:30.292
Fbi?

12:30.306 --> 12:33.283
- You've lived in this house for 4 years,correct?
- Yeah.

12:33.637 --> 12:38.202
- I assume disclosures were made at the time of sale about what occurred here?
- Yeah.

12:39.815 --> 12:42.992
My son doesn't know about that,
and I prefer to keep it that way.

12:43.007 --> 12:44.631
Of course. We understand.
We'll be discreet.

12:44.667 --> 12:46.922
We just need to take
a look at your cellar.

12:50.176 --> 12:52.703
I've had it locked up since we moved in.
You know, it'S...

12:52.715 --> 12:54.213
Kind of useless, anyway.

12:54.226 --> 12:59.440
Floods when it rains, you know, it's
really damp, and all the electrical's
messed up.

13:05.345 --> 13:07.070
Hope you guys don't
mind if I stay up here.

13:07.086 --> 13:09.641
We'll try not to take too long.

13:14.247 --> 13:18.611
So... he's done with the
tour of the main house.

13:18.986 --> 13:24.512
Before he goes,
he asks the realtor to see the cellar.

13:24.527 --> 13:26.560
And boom.

13:26.885 --> 13:29.593
Contusion on the back of her
head says he surprised her.

13:29.607 --> 13:31.871
He incapacitated her
with a blunt object.

13:31.886 --> 13:32.960
Thick walls.

13:32.977 --> 13:35.381
Neighbors are few
and far between.

13:36.147 --> 13:38.711
He can make her scream
as loud as he wants to.

13:38.727 --> 13:42.093
Rope burns on her wrists.
He probably suspended her.

13:42.205 --> 13:45.470
Here. Like in his drawings.

13:45.487 --> 13:49.503
And then he applied the current
and watched her whole body spasm.

13:49.518 --> 13:50.880
And makes her dance.

13:50.896 --> 13:52.493
But where does he
get the juice?

13:52.506 --> 13:55.713
Cattle prod? Taser?

13:56.497 --> 13:59.360
Contact wounds don't
conform to that.

14:01.357 --> 14:03.911
Outlet's been tampered with.

14:03.925 --> 14:05.862
Careful.

14:07.925 --> 14:09.521
Jerry-rigged.

14:09.538 --> 14:10.980
Clamp is still there.

14:10.996 --> 14:12.261
He didn't have to use a taser.

14:12.275 --> 14:14.441
He pulled power from the house.

14:14.455 --> 14:16.520
Handy guy.

14:19.196 --> 14:20.720
Dave and hotch are back.

14:20.736 --> 14:23.172
Thanks. I'll be right in.

14:25.707 --> 14:27.553
It's impressive.

14:28.405 --> 14:30.281
Oh, it's just
stuff on the wall.

14:30.295 --> 14:32.973
You know,
I didn't join the bureau to win awards.

14:32.987 --> 14:35.101
Then, uh,
maybe you can loan me a couple.

14:36.536 --> 14:40.331
Hey, um, J. J.
What do you think of these?

14:43.378 --> 14:44.391
What's this?

14:44.406 --> 14:46.933
Well, we can't call
him the unsub forever.

14:47.915 --> 14:52.052
We generally try not to
mythologize these guys.

14:52.587 --> 14:54.092
All right.

14:54.105 --> 14:56.510
And these aren't
very good, anyway.

14:56.746 --> 15:00.011
The fact is, we don't even
know if this guy's a serial.

15:00.028 --> 15:01.612
Actually, we do.

15:01.625 --> 15:07.270
3 females, age 31-38, discovered off
freeways in maryland, jersey, and
new york.

15:07.286 --> 15:09.752
All naked, burn wounds
consistent with the signature.

15:09.768 --> 15:14.320
And he disposed of all of the bodies in
different states to avoid detection.

15:14.337 --> 15:16.473
Garcia, when were these
bodies discovered?

15:16.488 --> 15:18.591
Between '02 and spring of '03.

15:18.606 --> 15:20.891
After the real estate agent,
he changed his methods.

15:20.906 --> 15:21.970
Fast learner.

15:21.986 --> 15:24.460
4 kills by the age of 30.

15:26.035 --> 15:27.513
And he was just
getting started.

15:28.588 --> 15:31.302
We connectedthe 3 new bodies
with missing person cases.

15:31.317 --> 15:35.381
So with a total of 4 victims on the
board, we were able to narrow down the
unsub's type.

15:35.398 --> 15:37.940
30s, attractive, caucasian,
upwardly mobile?

15:37.956 --> 15:38.841
Yeah.

15:38.857 --> 15:41.861
College grads,
above-average income, career women.

15:41.877 --> 15:43.132
You establish a cycle?

15:43.148 --> 15:45.472
10 months between the realtor
and the first of these victims.

15:45.506 --> 15:47.530
Then 7 months, 3 months.

15:47.548 --> 15:49.470
He's practically doubling
his pace every time.

15:49.488 --> 15:53.551
As with most prolific killers, the
cooling-off period tends to shorten
after each murder.

15:53.565 --> 15:56.332
Last know victim was
found almost 5 years ago.

15:56.758 --> 15:58.160
5 years?

15:58.175 --> 15:59.433
So could he haedtoppve s?

15:59.448 --> 16:00.903
No, not this guy.

16:00.917 --> 16:02.601
It's more likely we just
haven't found the bodies yet.

16:02.636 --> 16:04.333
And there might not even be bodies,
per se.

16:04.348 --> 16:08.580
We know he wrote extensively about
creating a homemade incinerator.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.542
So how many we
talking, ballpark?

16:11.556 --> 16:13.802
If you extrapolate the
cycle in the last 5 years,

16:13.815 --> 16:16.813
he will have killed
approximately 19 more women.

16:19.107 --> 16:21.203
It's great stuff, guys.

16:21.215 --> 16:23.192
Keep me posted.

16:26.856 --> 16:29.822
She does know we don't
work for her, right?

16:31.425 --> 16:36.020
With 4 known victims, we should start
by re-interviewing friends and family.

16:36.455 --> 16:40.003
We're looking for a white
male in his 30s to 40s.

16:40.018 --> 16:42.723
And with his knowledge
of circuitry and wiring,

16:42.738 --> 16:45.843
we think that he's either an
electrician or an electrical engineer.

16:45.855 --> 16:50.270
Rossi: It's a job that may give him
access to a victim's home or workplace,

16:50.287 --> 16:53.143
the opportunity to
observe his targets.

16:53.158 --> 16:55.670
They're attractive,
professional women.

16:55.687 --> 16:59.953
He sees them as strong,
righteous, unobtainable.

17:01.587 --> 17:07.811
So he seeks to tear them down, to reduce
them to base sexual creatures and
punish them.

17:09.017 --> 17:11.363
He's a true sexual sadist.

17:12.078 --> 17:14.912
A typology we refer to
as anger-excitation,

17:14.928 --> 17:18.900
meaning he becomes sexually aroused
by the suffering of his victims.

17:18.917 --> 17:21.339
Killing these women
is an afterthought.

17:21.355 --> 17:23.692
Their pain is what he's after.

17:23.708 --> 17:27.333
And he takes his time to
exact maximum stimulation.

17:27.348 --> 17:28.522
What about his trophies?

17:28.535 --> 17:29.711
He keeps their clothes, right?

17:29.728 --> 17:32.672
Yes. We believe he's using
them for rehearsal fantasies.

17:32.688 --> 17:35.832
By dressing as his victims,
he can relive the torture.

17:35.845 --> 17:38.863
It's during this time that he
most likely pleasures himself

17:38.875 --> 17:43.142
in order to reinforce his association
between suffering and gratification.

17:43.158 --> 17:46.940
And when he becomes dissatisfied with
this, he seeks out a new victim.

17:46.958 --> 17:49.542
Rossi: Keep in mind,
he's been doing this for a long time,

17:49.558 --> 17:52.530
and he's been thinking about
doing it most of his life.

17:52.548 --> 17:56.252
He'll continue to evolve,
finding new ways of challenging himself,

17:56.268 --> 17:58.872
increasing his
stimulation threshold.

17:58.886 --> 18:00.703
There are no boundaries
for this man.

18:00.716 --> 18:01.850
Hotch.

18:04.537 --> 18:08.363
He's an individual that we believe to be
currently active within our community.

18:08.377 --> 18:11.571
If it were not for certain evidence
brought to our attention in recent days,

18:11.588 --> 18:14.163
he may well have continued to
operate without our knowledge.

18:14.175 --> 18:15.562
We're still investigating
more specifics...

18:15.597 --> 18:18.832
- you know about this?
- Past murders and who might have been his victims.

18:18.845 --> 18:24.302
But now that he is on our radar, you can
rest assured that we will find him and
bring him to justice.

18:30.427 --> 18:33.363
Agent, I don't know how
you usually do things,

18:33.377 --> 18:36.963
but you need to let my team know if
you're planning on holding a
press conference.

18:36.976 --> 18:38.320
No, it wasn't a conference.

18:38.338 --> 18:39.622
It was just an announcement.

18:39.638 --> 18:41.350
I think you know what I mean.

18:41.368 --> 18:43.310
We're sending half the cops
in the city out to canvass.

18:43.346 --> 18:44.682
The story would have leaked.

18:44.698 --> 18:47.221
I was just putting a reassuring
face on the situation.

18:47.237 --> 18:48.370
Your face.

18:48.385 --> 18:49.361
I'm the case agent.

18:49.375 --> 18:51.523
And you're also outranked
by every member of my team.

18:51.537 --> 18:54.370
Meaning what,
you'll vote me off the island?

18:54.388 --> 18:58.883
Nothing tears a case apart faster than
an agent trying to make his or her name
on it.

18:58.895 --> 19:03.491
I'm trying to protect my city from what
could be the most prolific serial killer
since charles cullen.

19:03.507 --> 19:06.433
What about michael strenko,
florian gall, christopher hardgrove?

19:06.447 --> 19:07.471
I don't know those names.

19:07.486 --> 19:09.730
Those are cullen's victims.

19:09.748 --> 19:11.993
Nobody remembers the victims.
Everybody remembers the killer.

19:12.028 --> 19:15.681
And that's exactly what happens when an
agent puts the story ahead of the case.

19:15.697 --> 19:18.163
And the bureau doesn't need
any more agents like that.

19:18.175 --> 19:20.061
Do you understand?

19:29.977 --> 19:32.783
Reid: I have no doubt she's
highly capable. I'm just--

19:32.795 --> 19:37.791
I'm saying that I find her excitement
level at the prospect of finding more
bodies somewhat unsettling.

19:38.126 --> 19:38.790
Thank you.

19:38.807 --> 19:40.961
Yeah, J. J. Said she was making
up names for the killer.

19:40.977 --> 19:43.420
And yet, if she was a man,
you'd say she had balls.

19:43.435 --> 19:46.370
Oh, don't even go there.
This is not a gender thing.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.961
Right. Let's get
back to reid's map.

19:48.976 --> 19:52.681
All right, the nearness principle tells
us that a killer won't travel far to
abduct his victims,

19:52.716 --> 19:56.503
but this one's gone to great lengths to
spread out his abduction and
disposal sites.

19:56.517 --> 19:59.243
So the sites are irrelevant
to the geographical profile?

19:59.258 --> 20:02.051
The only location I can attach a
real meaning to is the storage unit.

20:02.066 --> 20:04.203
4 victims and we got squat.

20:05.575 --> 20:06.511
For years he's gone unchecked.

20:06.546 --> 20:10.632
I think it's only a matter of time
before he grows comfortable and starts
killing closer to home.

20:10.646 --> 20:14.492
Unfortunately, that only helps
us if there's a fresh kill.

20:15.627 --> 20:19.431
So there's a woman out there right now
who has to die so we can do our job.

20:37.065 --> 20:38.890
- Did something happen?
- Yeah.

20:38.907 --> 20:42.932
Uh, agent hotchner tore me a new one,
and I owe you an apology.

20:42.945 --> 20:43.823
Why me?

20:43.838 --> 20:46.000
I got you to bring the
whole team up here.

20:46.017 --> 20:48.471
And then... the press briefing.

20:48.487 --> 20:50.181
It could have waited
until morning.

20:50.196 --> 20:53.991
My conscience doesn't allow
sleep in these situations.

20:55.097 --> 20:57.471
Looks like you
could use a break.

20:59.656 --> 21:01.162
There are no breaks.

21:01.178 --> 21:03.402
But there are drinks.

21:03.417 --> 21:05.233
Let me buy you one.

21:05.248 --> 21:08.792
Female ambition can be unseemly
in the eyes of some people.

21:08.806 --> 21:11.060
And I forget that sometimes.

21:11.518 --> 21:16.410
When I was in the academy in '97, I
scored 99 on my defensive tactics test,

21:16.425 --> 21:21.873
which, needless to say, had an immediate
chilling effect on all my relations with
the male cadets.

21:22.687 --> 21:26.780
I bet you can't remember a time
when you didn't overachieve.

21:26.795 --> 21:32.222
Well, the youngest kid in a
single-parent home, you learn to scratch
and claw real quick.

21:32.236 --> 21:33.753
Single parent.

21:33.768 --> 21:35.632
That would be your father?

21:35.645 --> 21:36.542
Go on.

21:36.555 --> 21:41.572
A good man, who you came to see as weak,
unable to provide,

21:41.587 --> 21:46.092
probably a drinker--I'm
guessing scotch.

21:46.986 --> 21:48.593
Blended.

21:49.405 --> 21:51.651
I prefer single malt.

21:52.347 --> 21:55.423
I think I did a seminar
at the academy in '97.

21:55.435 --> 21:57.843
Yes. "Collateral
materials on sex crimes. "

21:57.855 --> 22:00.930
I was in the third row,
hanging on every word.

22:00.945 --> 22:01.883
Good memory.

22:02.186 --> 22:05.390
Well, your first book had just
come out and you signed my copy.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.790
Yeah, I kind of had
a thing for you.

22:09.385 --> 22:12.033
Come on. You were a star.

22:12.046 --> 22:16.562
No one in the bureau had made inroads
into publishing and consulting like
you had.

22:17.776 --> 22:20.282
Your hair was lighter and a
big longer then, wasn't it?

22:20.295 --> 22:22.583
Talk about a good memory.

22:22.596 --> 22:24.680
No. I don't remember you.

22:25.345 --> 22:30.430
But that would explain the hair that you
claim to have found in that
storage unit.

22:30.906 --> 22:33.843
The hair was a keepsake,
I'm guessing?

22:33.858 --> 22:38.263
You held on to it as a vestige of the
femininity you relinquished in
the pursuit

22:38.275 --> 22:40.131
of your career ambitions?

22:40.145 --> 22:41.373
You can stop profiling.

22:41.408 --> 22:44.513
You manufactured evidence to get a B.
A. U. Commitment.

22:44.527 --> 22:47.041
And it was for
the greater good.

22:47.058 --> 22:48.712
I was right, wasn't I?

22:48.728 --> 22:51.123
Look, jill, I know you.

22:51.136 --> 22:54.011
When I was your age I
wanted the same things.

22:54.027 --> 22:57.983
But I burned a lot of bridges in
the process. People got hurt.

22:58.375 --> 23:03.471
Is that why you came back,
to undo your past wrongs?

23:05.237 --> 23:07.521
Just be careful.

23:07.538 --> 23:10.743
That ego of yours is going
to get you into trouble.

23:11.418 --> 23:13.941
Now I've got to get some sleep.

23:14.927 --> 23:18.300
Your little press conference
is gonna bury us tomorrow.

23:19.157 --> 23:20.250
Bury us how?

23:20.266 --> 23:22.460
I had a nightmare the
night she went missing.

23:22.477 --> 23:25.610
It woke me up,
but I forgot it instantly.

23:25.625 --> 23:27.211
You know how that happens?

23:27.227 --> 23:28.992
I know this sounds crazy.

23:29.005 --> 23:33.152
I feel like if I could
remember that dream,

23:33.517 --> 23:34.840
I'd know what happened to her.

23:34.858 --> 23:38.921
When she didn't show on time,
I left her a message on her cell phone.

23:39.306 --> 23:40.521
I was...

23:40.536 --> 23:44.942
Angry with her for making us late.
I didn't know.

23:45.995 --> 23:49.150
And that message is probably
still on her phone somewhere.

23:49.455 --> 23:51.931
It keeps me up at night
wondering if she ever heard it.

23:51.945 --> 23:54.323
I just want to know
if she's still alive.

23:54.338 --> 23:56.192
It's the not knowing.

23:56.205 --> 23:59.783
It's selfish, I know--
our own peace of mind.

24:00.888 --> 24:04.622
She disappeared 2 months ago
on her way home from work.

24:05.716 --> 24:07.750
This is what she was wearing.

24:07.765 --> 24:09.491
We just want to know
what happened to her.

24:09.505 --> 24:10.352
It hurts.

24:10.365 --> 24:12.991
It hurts me. You like it.

24:13.008 --> 24:14.013
What?

24:14.025 --> 24:16.040
You like how it feels.

24:16.058 --> 24:18.573
I like it.

24:18.587 --> 24:19.773
Do you love the pain?

24:19.788 --> 24:20.482
- No.
- No.

24:20.495 --> 24:22.001
Yes. Yes.

24:22.447 --> 24:23.460
No. Don'T.

24:23.478 --> 24:24.532
Ask for it.

24:24.548 --> 24:25.600
No, don't!

24:25.615 --> 24:27.463
- Don't!Don't!
- Please!

24:27.785 --> 24:28.980
Please no more!

24:30.875 --> 24:31.491
Oh, it hurts.

24:31.507 --> 24:34.400
- No!No!Just kill me!
- It's so bad.

24:34.418 --> 24:36.092
Just kill me.

24:36.105 --> 24:37.441
Just kill me.

24:42.677 --> 24:43.941
Philadelphia police department.

24:43.955 --> 24:45.193
Man: I think I saw something.

24:45.205 --> 24:46.681
It might have to do
with the killings.

24:46.716 --> 24:47.631
What did you see?

24:47.647 --> 24:49.910
My car broke down on I-76.

24:49.928 --> 24:51.401
There was a field off the road.

24:51.415 --> 24:52.973
A man was digging a hole.

24:52.985 --> 24:53.802
What kind of hole?

24:53.818 --> 24:55.380
For the body. I saw it.

24:55.398 --> 24:58.021
A bleeder stripped
of its clothes.

24:58.036 --> 24:59.380
Can I have your name, sir?

24:59.397 --> 25:02.392
Mile marker 115
on the eastbound.

25:03.315 --> 25:05.081
They'll find it.

25:05.098 --> 25:06.382
Anything strike you?

25:06.395 --> 25:09.471
Stripped of its clothes.
Objectifies the victim.

25:09.485 --> 25:11.961
Exactly. Dehumanizing.

25:11.975 --> 25:13.913
This wasn't just any tipster.

25:13.927 --> 25:16.683
The way that he referred to
the body as a bleeder...

25:16.698 --> 25:18.072
Visible trauma to the corpse.

25:18.087 --> 25:21.633
No, I don't think so. I noted usage of
the same word in the pages from the
storage facility.

25:21.665 --> 25:23.631
He refers to his
targets as bleeders.

25:23.646 --> 25:26.030
It's misogynistic.
He's referring to menstruation.

25:26.046 --> 25:27.370
He'd use it as a weakness.

25:27.386 --> 25:30.072
I think we need to see
what's in that field.

25:36.278 --> 25:38.162
- Morning.
- Good morning.

25:42.836 --> 25:44.222
Body looks well-preserved.

25:44.238 --> 25:46.142
Been some cold snaps
the last few months.

25:46.155 --> 25:47.131
Ground's frozen.

25:47.148 --> 25:49.010
Check out her stomach.

25:49.395 --> 25:51.483
Prentiss: Electrical burns.

25:52.578 --> 25:54.753
Fingers are in
really bad shape.

25:54.768 --> 25:56.301
How are her teeth?

25:58.105 --> 25:59.530
Looks good for an I. D.

25:59.548 --> 26:01.280
To say we need a rush on that
would be an understatement.

26:01.315 --> 26:02.672
- You understand?
- Yeah.

26:02.688 --> 26:03.990
Thank you.

26:04.796 --> 26:06.752
Let's get her up.

26:15.046 --> 26:17.330
You guys might want
to stick around.

26:33.317 --> 26:37.641
He calls in anonymously and
hands us 2 more victims. Why?

26:37.925 --> 26:39.773
You vowed publicly
to bring him in.

26:39.785 --> 26:41.351
He may be reacting to that.

26:41.366 --> 26:43.762
To show you who you're dealing with.
He's a narcissist.

26:43.778 --> 26:46.011
- He's preening.
- Good.

26:46.026 --> 26:47.823
I hope he keeps it up.

26:47.838 --> 26:49.102
You don't want that.

26:49.118 --> 26:52.160
He will drop a breadcrumb every
time he tries something like this.

26:52.177 --> 26:54.113
He'll drop bodies, too.

26:54.128 --> 26:57.921
If he's making it personal,
he'll get sloppy and give himself away.

26:57.935 --> 27:00.711
Maybe that's what he wants.

27:01.038 --> 27:04.242
It never tracked for me that this
guy defaulted on that storage unit.

27:04.257 --> 27:05.633
You think he wanted
us to find it?

27:05.646 --> 27:08.342
Maybe he's decided it's time
for the world to know his name.

27:08.356 --> 27:11.620
But if he wanted a coming-out party,
then why not just send his
victim photos,

27:11.637 --> 27:14.082
videos, something to
prove what he is.

27:14.635 --> 27:18.240
He wanted us to start at the beginning,
to chart his evolution.

27:18.255 --> 27:20.312
Bright childhood
grows into darkness.

27:20.327 --> 27:22.302
He's got us
chronicling every step.

27:22.317 --> 27:25.670
So if this is his story,
what chapter are we on?

27:25.685 --> 27:26.993
The final one.

27:27.006 --> 27:29.233
He's writing it as we speak.

27:32.058 --> 27:35.451
Hey, honey, um, I think we have
to cancel with your parents.

27:35.465 --> 27:37.261
I know, I know.
I'm really sorry.

27:37.278 --> 27:41.663
It's just, I'm on deadline and I'm
gonna be cutting it close as it is.

27:41.677 --> 27:44.492
I will make it up to you,
I promise. Ok?

27:44.505 --> 27:46.730
First thing next week-- yes.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.353
No, we'll have-- Uh--

27:52.065 --> 27:55.042
gil? Yeah, I, uh--
someone rear-ended me.

27:55.058 --> 27:56.470
No, no, I-I'm fine. It's fine.

27:56.488 --> 27:59.730
Look, let me call you back.
Yeah, ok.

28:00.796 --> 28:02.611
Hey, I'm sorry about that.
Are you ok?

28:02.626 --> 28:03.992
I'm fine.

28:04.617 --> 28:07.191
I just wish I could say
the same for my car.

28:07.205 --> 28:10.022
Oh, it's my brakes.
I've been meaning to get them fixed.

28:10.036 --> 28:11.610
Well, just tell me
you're insured.

28:11.626 --> 28:13.950
Oh, yeah, of course.
It's the law, right?

28:13.965 --> 28:16.013
Just let me get my card.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.781
Hey, you know, I should probably get
your information, too, just to be safe.

28:18.818 --> 28:20.540
Absolutely.

28:43.878 --> 28:45.323
When I got shot,

28:45.337 --> 28:50.673
I kept wondering why god would program
our bodies to register that kind
of pain.

28:50.688 --> 28:52.363
And you know what
got me through it?

28:52.378 --> 28:54.211
No, penelope, I don'T. Tell me.

28:54.228 --> 28:56.401
Knowing that the pain
would eventually end.

28:56.416 --> 28:58.351
But these women,
they don't even have that.

28:58.367 --> 29:01.580
When he's torturing them,
there's no end, just--

29:02.565 --> 29:07.003
And philly lab matched the I. D. S of
the dental records on the two women from
the grave.

29:07.017 --> 29:08.691
Go ahead. Guys.

29:09.007 --> 29:10.821
Mimi adams and sara coswell.

29:10.835 --> 29:13.871
You'll find them in the missing person
files we've flagged as possible victims.

29:13.908 --> 29:15.571
Thanks, mama, we're on it.

29:16.057 --> 29:17.913
Wait, there's something else.

29:17.926 --> 29:20.743
Both women were reported
missing 4 months ago...

29:20.756 --> 29:22.242
On the same day.

29:22.257 --> 29:23.261
He's doing doubles.

29:23.277 --> 29:24.013
Doubles.

29:24.028 --> 29:26.750
Killer got bored, upped the stakes,
and did 2 women in one day.

29:26.765 --> 29:27.962
Gerard schaefer did it.

29:27.977 --> 29:29.171
He took his cue from bundy.

29:29.186 --> 29:31.022
Said it was twice as hard,
but twice as much fun.

29:31.055 --> 29:34.901
Yeah, so he kills with impunity for
years without the slightest bit of heat
and he needs a bigger fix.

29:34.936 --> 29:36.020
So he starts doing two a day.

29:36.056 --> 29:39.661
4 months later he still can't get off,
so he opens his storage locker for us.

29:39.677 --> 29:42.392
Jill. Chronicle holding on 2.

29:42.407 --> 29:45.283
Yeah, I'll take
that in my office.

29:46.658 --> 29:49.072
Planning another
press conference?

29:56.768 --> 29:57.810
Agent morris.

29:57.825 --> 29:59.442
I-it's kat townsley.

29:59.456 --> 30:02.190
Look, kat, I know I owe you,
but I don't have anything right now.

30:02.207 --> 30:03.960
And even if I did,
I couldn't tell you.

30:03.978 --> 30:06.943
No, actually,
I have something for you.

30:06.956 --> 30:07.932
Uh, check your e-mail.

30:07.945 --> 30:10.451
Just one second.

30:10.805 --> 30:11.781
You all right?

30:11.797 --> 30:13.541
You sure sound tired.

30:13.555 --> 30:14.763
I'm fine.

30:15.417 --> 30:17.043
Do you have it?

30:17.058 --> 30:18.461
Yeah. What is it?

30:18.478 --> 30:22.772
It was sent to my by the guy claiming
to be the pererson you're looking for.

30:23.928 --> 30:25.870
Breadcrumb.

30:25.885 --> 30:27.171
What?

30:28.708 --> 30:31.360
I need to read the
rest of this letter.

30:33.008 --> 30:35.610
- I'll come meet you.
- Ok.

30:39.886 --> 30:41.591
I heard we got I. D.
S on these two bodies.

30:41.606 --> 30:43.460
Mimi adams and sara coswell.

30:43.476 --> 30:44.392
What's up?

30:44.408 --> 30:46.172
This woman's husband
came in before.

30:46.187 --> 30:47.982
She fits the victim type.
I thought maybe...

30:47.997 --> 30:49.943
If you have her dna, you might
want to check it against the hair.

30:49.978 --> 30:50.541
What hair?

30:50.558 --> 30:52.550
From the storage unit.
Agent morris found it early on.

30:52.588 --> 30:55.532
- It's the same color, so it might-
- it won't match.

30:55.545 --> 30:56.862
Reid: I know it's a long shot,
but I think--

30:56.897 --> 31:00.151
she didn't get the
hair from the unit.

31:00.447 --> 31:02.141
She lied?

31:03.076 --> 31:04.661
When were you gonna tell us?

31:04.676 --> 31:06.873
Whatever she did to get us here,
we're here now.

31:06.885 --> 31:08.230
It's unacceptable behavior.

31:08.245 --> 31:09.581
Why do you keep defending her?

31:09.598 --> 31:11.880
Because I know what she is.

31:11.896 --> 31:13.862
She's me 20 years ago.

31:13.876 --> 31:15.231
She's nothing like you, dave.

31:15.245 --> 31:17.942
Come on, hotch,
I know what people think.

31:17.957 --> 31:20.722
I took serial
killers mass market.

31:20.735 --> 31:24.303
Now everyone knows their names,
but not the victims, right?

31:24.315 --> 31:27.913
Somewhere along the line,
I put myself first.

31:27.928 --> 31:30.921
I admit it.
I can't go back and change it.

31:31.438 --> 31:34.251
But it's not too late for her.

31:36.496 --> 31:39.993
Missing persons flagged a
report that was just filed.

31:40.005 --> 31:40.922
A possible victim?

31:40.935 --> 31:44.342
The subject's car was found idling at a
stop sign, and there was some damage to
the back end.

31:44.377 --> 31:45.313
Sounds like a bump and grab.

31:45.346 --> 31:47.300
Did she fit his profile
career, age-wise?

31:47.315 --> 31:51.041
Katrina townsley, 34.
She's a reporter at the chronicle.

31:51.357 --> 31:53.243
Chronicle?

32:01.688 --> 32:03.261
What is it?

32:03.646 --> 32:06.490
This letter-- did we have this?

32:07.116 --> 32:08.812
No.

32:09.436 --> 32:11.832
I've never seen this before.

32:11.848 --> 32:14.882
Why would he send
agent morris a letter?

32:15.365 --> 32:18.313
She's his final chapter.

33:35.125 --> 33:36.591
They ableto track her car?

33:36.605 --> 33:38.583
No. She doesn't have a nav system,
but her cell's got gps.

33:38.615 --> 33:39.630
Is the signal moving?

33:39.646 --> 33:41.741
Stationary. Reid and
rossi are en route.

33:41.758 --> 33:43.602
Hey, girl. How you doing with
that e-mail we sent you?

33:43.635 --> 33:45.171
I've got the
sender's ip address.

33:45.185 --> 33:47.961
Goes to an internet cafe
just outside germantown.

33:47.976 --> 33:49.602
Ok, good. Send us the address.

33:50.155 --> 33:50.821
I've just talked to reid.

33:50.856 --> 33:53.412
They found jill's phone on
the ground near her car.

33:53.427 --> 33:54.051
On the ground?

33:54.067 --> 33:56.472
In a parking garage
north of center city.

33:56.485 --> 33:57.543
Blood here.

33:58.176 --> 34:00.220
A couple of drops.

34:00.236 --> 34:02.242
Looks like she was dragged.

34:02.258 --> 34:04.150
This shouldn't have happened.

34:04.167 --> 34:07.183
Her guard was down. He tricked her into
thinking she was meeting a friend.

34:07.198 --> 34:12.152
I told her, slow down,
check your ego, use your team.

34:12.705 --> 34:15.891
David, there's no way you could have
known that she was gonna go off
by herself.

34:15.907 --> 34:17.411
I did know.

34:17.428 --> 34:20.110
Sure as I know myself.

34:40.766 --> 34:41.661
No!

34:43.146 --> 34:44.712
You can go louder.

34:48.967 --> 34:50.362
Don't, please!

34:53.806 --> 34:56.302
That computer was used exactly
4 hours and 12 minutes ago.

34:56.318 --> 34:59.510
Now, I need you to try to remember
the man that was sitting there.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.901
I can't remember.

35:01.918 --> 35:03.640
I mean,
we get a lot of people in here.

35:03.668 --> 35:05.662
I understand.
He would have paid in cash.

35:05.676 --> 35:08.332
White, 30s to 40s.

35:08.847 --> 35:12.873
Solidly built, physically imposing,
maybe blue collar.

35:13.145 --> 35:14.463
There was this one guy.

35:14.475 --> 35:18.463
Big, kind of blond hair...

35:19.708 --> 35:21.762
Maybe left in a white van.

35:21.776 --> 35:23.770
Good. Thanks.

35:30.335 --> 35:32.312
Are you ready?

35:36.035 --> 35:38.132
Beg me not to.

35:43.227 --> 35:44.320
You will.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.862
All right,
here's the garage where jill was taken.

35:49.876 --> 35:52.292
Presumably an area the
unsub's familiar with.

35:52.308 --> 35:54.690
You're not gonna abduct a federal
agent outside your comfort zone.

35:54.725 --> 35:59.961
Right. This is where we are right now,
and the third point is the storage unit
right here.

36:00.436 --> 36:02.362
It's a 4-mile radius.

36:02.375 --> 36:04.450
What do we have right
here in the center?

36:04.468 --> 36:07.770
Garcia, I need those pretty
little hands of yours, mama.

36:07.788 --> 36:11.232
Listen up, I want you to bring up the
citywide list we generated for
the electricians,

36:11.248 --> 36:13.982
power company employees,
and electrical engineers.

36:13.998 --> 36:15.892
They number in the thousands.

36:15.905 --> 36:17.021
Can you narrow this?

36:17.038 --> 36:18.710
Reid just sent you 3 addresses.

36:18.726 --> 36:21.580
Triangulate and cross the
names within that surface.

36:23.807 --> 36:24.953
Dozens. I need more.

36:24.968 --> 36:26.372
- Is that garcia?
- Yeah.

36:26.388 --> 36:27.560
Search dmv records.

36:27.577 --> 36:30.511
The manager thought he saw
him leave in a white van.

36:30.528 --> 36:32.110
Morgan: Did you get that?

36:32.957 --> 36:35.110
Yahtzee.

36:49.498 --> 36:52.182
I'm gonna take my
time with you.

37:03.666 --> 37:05.400
They're coming.

37:06.756 --> 37:07.992
It's over.

37:08.005 --> 37:10.172
No, it'll never be over.

37:12.216 --> 37:13.810
Not for us.

37:13.828 --> 37:15.640
Fbi!

37:23.826 --> 37:26.130
I need a medic. Get a medic!

37:28.297 --> 37:28.931
David.

37:28.948 --> 37:30.362
It's ok.
It's gonna be all right.

37:30.376 --> 37:31.850
It's ok.

37:33.328 --> 37:36.220
It's ok. It's ok.

37:36.238 --> 37:37.372
- I'm sorry.
- It's ok.

37:37.387 --> 37:38.601
Don't worry about it. It's ok.

37:38.617 --> 37:40.883
- I'm sorry.
- You're gonna be alril ght.

37:40.895 --> 37:43.521
It's ok. It's ok, jill.

38:00.006 --> 38:02.383
Jeremy andrus, 41.

38:02.696 --> 38:07.201
Broken home, poverty, trade school,
petty crime, lewd behavior--

38:07.218 --> 38:09.111
the whole profile's here
in black and white.

38:09.128 --> 38:11.352
That's a small consolation.

38:11.368 --> 38:12.741
How many is he up to?

38:14.065 --> 38:16.962
They haven't even gotten
through the 2006 pile.

38:16.977 --> 38:18.822
Has he told us where
to find the remains?

38:18.837 --> 38:21.382
No. He doesn't speak.

38:21.396 --> 38:23.302
He just points.

38:27.878 --> 38:29.510
You're sure you're not rushing?

38:29.526 --> 38:30.931
I'm fine.

38:31.257 --> 38:32.862
And you didn't
need to come here.

38:32.876 --> 38:35.012
I just wanted to
see if you were ok.

38:35.025 --> 38:38.852
In itself a passive-aggressive
means of saying, "I told you so. "

38:38.866 --> 38:44.800
I don't need to tell you that what
you've gone through, what you've
witnessed, is a trauma.

38:44.815 --> 38:46.493
You're right. You don'T.

38:46.506 --> 38:49.820
The fact that you didn't ask about
the condition of the other victim--

38:49.836 --> 38:52.202
implying that I'm a
victim when I'm not.

38:52.218 --> 38:57.692
Leads me to believe that you're
already in an early stage of denial.

38:57.937 --> 39:00.331
I can handle it.

39:03.306 --> 39:05.970
She didn't make it, jill.

39:23.857 --> 39:25.572
Man: Agent morris.

39:36.866 --> 39:38.493
There she is!

39:41.538 --> 39:42.572
Agent morris!

39:42.586 --> 39:45.730
Agent morris, what made you believe
there was a killer out there when no one
else did?

39:45.768 --> 39:47.932
Man: How did his crimes
go unnoticed for so long?

39:47.945 --> 39:50.573
- Have you been approached by any publishers?
- Do you fear for your safety?

39:50.605 --> 39:52.222
If I can just have one
question at at time.

39:52.258 --> 39:53.692
I promise I will
get to all of you.

39:53.707 --> 39:55.801
- Have you been approached by any publishers?
- No

39:55.817 --> 39:58.513
Man: Can you tell us, agent morris,
did you fear for your safety?

39:58.525 --> 39:59.033
Absolutely.

39:59.045 --> 40:01.653
What was it liked to come face
to face with a serial killer?

40:01.667 --> 40:03.172
Is there a book deal
in your future?

40:03.645 --> 40:04.631
What were your injuries?

40:04.647 --> 40:07.152
I hear there were
multiple abductions.

40:07.167 --> 40:08.232
- Multiple abductions.
- Serial killer.

40:08.268 --> 40:09.920
Do you have any
further information?

40:10.677 --> 40:12.112
Do you have an agent yet?

40:12.547 --> 40:15.082
Are you still working on the case?
Working on the case?

40:15.096 --> 40:16.131
Jill: No.

40:16.145 --> 40:18.093
At this point,
the case is closed.

40:18.108 --> 40:22.123
"For we pay a price for everything
we get or take in this world, "

40:22.136 --> 40:27.112
and although ambitions are well worth
having, they are not to be cheaply
won. "
