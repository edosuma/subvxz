00:05.092 --> 00:07.659
Oh.

00:07.746 --> 00:10.314
I'm glad I stretched.

00:10.401 --> 00:12.534
Welcome to Salsa
for Beginners.

00:12.621 --> 00:14.884
I ask you to relax,
be loose and enjoy.

00:14.971 --> 00:17.104
Let me demonstrate.

00:17.191 --> 00:20.063
Can we go?

00:20.150 --> 00:21.934
We haven't even
danced yet.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.285
Come on, I think I wrenched
my knee getting out of the car.

00:24.372 --> 00:25.677
You said it was
your left knee.

00:25.764 --> 00:26.983
I can have two bad knees.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.724
And a bad attitude.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.334
You said you were excited
about this salsa class.

00:30.421 --> 00:34.295
'Cause I thought it was
a different kind of salsa.

00:34.382 --> 00:36.775
The salsa is a whole body dance.

00:36.862 --> 00:38.255
The music is the soul

00:38.342 --> 00:40.475
that triggers the spirit
of the dancing.

00:40.562 --> 00:41.824
Follow me.

00:41.911 --> 00:43.652
Oh.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.132
Yeah, I'm just
letting you know right now,

00:45.219 --> 00:48.222
my body does not do that.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.137
As you step forward,
turn your hip

00:50.224 --> 00:52.182
as if your foot is
squishing a bug.

00:52.269 --> 00:53.531
Oh.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.359
Then together,
then back.

00:55.446 --> 00:57.840
Squish
the bug!
[laughs]

00:57.927 --> 01:00.756
Come on, squish the bug.

01:02.714 --> 01:03.411
There you go.

01:03.498 --> 01:05.369
I got to admit,

01:05.456 --> 01:09.330
the killing-roaches thing
really made it make sense.

01:09.417 --> 01:11.680
The rhythm is
in the body,

01:11.767 --> 01:14.639
but the passion
is in the hips.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.209
She's got a lot
of passion.

01:21.690 --> 01:22.908
I can't stop staring.

01:22.995 --> 01:24.997
It's oddly hypnotizing.

Ooh, at the end
of ten classes,

01:56.246 --> 01:59.423
we get personalized
castanets.

01:59.510 --> 02:03.340
Ten? I thought that stupid
gift certificate was for one.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.429
That thoughtful
gift certificate was for ten,

02:05.516 --> 02:07.779
and it would be rude
if we didn't do 'em all.

02:07.866 --> 02:08.737
It was from your mother
and Vince.

02:08.824 --> 02:09.999
I'm fine with rude.

02:10.086 --> 02:11.653
Mike.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.437
Come on. I did it once,
because I love you.

02:13.524 --> 02:15.091
And you're not gonna
make me do it again,

02:15.178 --> 02:18.616
because you love me.

02:18.703 --> 02:20.792
We never do fun stuff together.

02:20.879 --> 02:22.533
And tonight
changed nothing.

02:22.620 --> 02:25.362
Oh, I'm sorry that dancing
with your wife is such torture.

02:25.449 --> 02:26.842
Hey, don't take
it personal.

02:26.929 --> 02:28.713
I would have hated that
with anyone.

02:28.800 --> 02:33.283
Come on. I loved that class, and
I don't want to do by myself.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.111
For me?

02:35.198 --> 02:36.721
Oh, come on, that's not fair.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.854
How am I supposed
to say no to that?

02:38.941 --> 02:40.551
You can't.

02:40.638 --> 02:42.597
Yeah.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.732
You know, I think dance lessons
will be good for you.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.256
Get you more in tune
with your body.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.127
Why do you think
wide receivers take ballet?

02:51.214 --> 02:52.041
'Cause their wives make 'em?

02:52.128 --> 02:55.000
No.

02:55.087 --> 02:56.437
Because they want to learn
how to point their toes

02:56.524 --> 02:58.090
so they can get two feet
in the end zone.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.875
Think about what it'll do
for your police work.

02:59.962 --> 03:02.704
How is me salsa dancing
going to help catch crooks?

03:02.791 --> 03:04.532
I would imagine

03:04.619 --> 03:06.360
a criminal pointing and laughing
is easier to apprehend.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.102
Why don't you tell your wife

03:10.190 --> 03:11.582
you don't want
to take the lessons?

03:11.669 --> 03:12.409
Why don't you tell yours?

03:12.496 --> 03:14.368
I don't have one.

03:14.455 --> 03:15.978
Exactly.

03:18.328 --> 03:19.460
What are you complaining about?

03:19.547 --> 03:20.896
Salsa dancing is a blast.

Sexy music, short skirts,
very erotic.

03:22.289 --> 03:24.204
Yeah, me and grandmother--

03:24.291 --> 03:26.597
we took lessons together
for years.

03:31.167 --> 03:34.997
Well, that is not creepy at all.

03:35.084 --> 03:36.825
It kept me on the straight
and narrow.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.392
Instead of getting mixed up
in drugs,

03:38.479 --> 03:39.175
I was addicted to the
intoxicating rhythms

to love this stuff.

03:59.369 --> 04:01.371
Mm.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.155
I don't suppose that you'd like

04:03.243 --> 04:05.984
to take a refresher course
with Molly?

04:06.071 --> 04:08.248
You want me to go dancing with
the woman who shares your bed?

04:08.335 --> 04:11.903
Well, no, not
when you put it like that.

04:11.990 --> 04:14.166
But yeah.

All right.
I'm game if Molly is.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.388
Are you kidding?
She'll be thrilled.

Before I came along,

04:20.216 --> 04:21.348
she used to do all sorts
of fun stuff with gay guys.

04:23.437 --> 04:24.786
Well, then, great.

No, no, no, no.

Yeah, he didn't
want to come.
Yeah.

who's enjoying themselves.

to set off the fire alarm

I think they're actually
brother and sister.

Sadly, I don't think
that answers my question.

can get rough.

I know, but I got to eat
something before I go to work.

I am so glad
that I am not single,

to do any of that anymore.

never did any of that stuff.

I don't care who it is.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.724
We gave you the dancing lessons
for Christmas

07:00.811 --> 07:02.596
to get you both
out of the house.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.467
I told you, the only way

07:04.554 --> 07:07.252
to get this load off the
couch was with hockey tickets.

might be in their 70s,

07:45.856 --> 07:47.771
Yeah, I mean,
I missed you,

07:47.858 --> 07:49.512

to know Carl a little better.

07:49.599 --> 07:52.297
Seriously?
Yeah.

07:52.384 --> 07:53.908
I mean, he's a really
interesting guy.

07:53.995 --> 07:56.519
Do you know he's saving up money
to go to India?

07:56.606 --> 07:58.565
India?
Yeah.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.349
Sure he didn't say "Indiana"?

08:00.436 --> 08:02.569
'Cause that's where he goes
to buy his fireworks.

08:02.656 --> 08:05.006
I'm sure.
Carl's a very spiritual guy.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.574
Do you know he meditates
for 20 minutes every day.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.619
That's stupid.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.842
Wonder why
he never told me that.

08:14.929 --> 08:18.541
Yeah, I can't imagine
why he doesn't tell you stuff.

He tells me stuff.

I'll bet you didn't know
he still has a baby tooth.

Ooh, is it the one
that's cold-sensitive?

from his left side.

I didn't.

Or did I?

Yeah.

08:40.084 --> 08:41.825
He said he could never tell me

08:41.912 --> 08:44.306
because it was
in the magician's code.

08:44.393 --> 08:47.178
There's a certain level of trust
between dance partners.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.703
We have to have it.
It's complicated.

on the dance floor last night.

[fake-trumpets

So, what's the deal with going
to a club afterwards?

09:31.571 --> 09:33.616
Oh, yeah, that
was Molly's idea.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.792
She took us to this
hot little Cuban joint.

09:35.879 --> 09:38.012
Man, I bought her
a caipirinha and a cigar,

09:38.099 --> 09:39.579
she was like a little
hip-shaking Fidel Castro.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.234
Molly doesn't like cigars.

09:43.321 --> 09:46.368
Really? She smoked that
one down to the label.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.196
[chuckles] And I love
the story she was telling

09:48.283 --> 09:49.937
about fighting
the baby bull in Mexico.

wouldn't want to go.I don't.

something I would say.

10:43.207 --> 10:45.470
And then we'll probably
grab dinner afterwards.

10:45.557 --> 10:47.559
You know, to discuss it.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.039
What's to discuss?

10:49.126 --> 10:51.520
A movie either stinks
or it doesn't.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.348
Thumbs up, thumbs down,

10:53.435 --> 10:56.003
get in the car, go home.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.526
Can we talk about this later?

10:57.613 --> 10:58.614
'Cause I don't
want to make Carl late.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.050
He is so punctual.

11:00.137 --> 11:02.226
I know what he is.

11:02.313 --> 11:04.272
I've known him a lot longer
than you have.

11:04.359 --> 11:05.665
Okay, clearly you
do have a problem with me

11:05.752 --> 11:08.015
going to this movie with Carl.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.451
No, I don't.

11:09.538 --> 11:10.408
You sure?

11:10.495 --> 11:13.107
Don't be ridiculous.

11:13.194 --> 11:15.892
Okay, so I'm gonna go
and you're gonna be fine?

11:15.979 --> 11:16.676
Absolutely.

11:16.763 --> 11:20.375
All right.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.289
What are you doing?

11:21.376 --> 11:23.291
I'm going with you.

11:27.077 --> 11:29.036
Ooh. Wow.

11:29.123 --> 11:31.560
They did a beautiful
restoration on this place.

11:31.647 --> 11:34.519
Mm-hmm. Sure wasn't this nice
when it was a porno theater.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.391
And you know
that how?

11:36.478 --> 11:38.785
Oh, I busted it a few times
when I worked Vice.Oh.

11:38.872 --> 11:40.612
Should have seen
all the perverts scatter.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.050
It's a strange sound, hearing
50 zippers go up at once.

11:43.137 --> 11:45.139
[laughs]

11:47.881 --> 11:50.274
You never worked Vice.

11:50.361 --> 11:54.409
Don't embarrass me
in front of your wife.Aw...

11:54.496 --> 11:56.977
You know, I did some
reading up on this film.

11:57.064 --> 11:59.631
It's part of the
Neorealism school.Mm-hmm?

11:59.719 --> 12:01.329
That means "new real."

12:01.416 --> 12:03.853
You know, Kurosawa said
it was his favorite film.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.899
Did he, now?Yup.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.596
You don't know who that is.

12:07.683 --> 12:09.772
I know he's Japanese
and he liked this movie.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.034
He's Japanese, right?

12:11.121 --> 12:12.949
[chuckles]:
Yeah.

12:13.036 --> 12:15.430
Yeah, he's one of Japan's
finest filmmakers.Mm.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.780
Is he the Godzillaguy?

12:19.260 --> 12:22.611
Yeah, he's the Godzillaguy.

12:22.698 --> 12:25.222
Well, now, he knows
what he's doing.

12:25.309 --> 12:28.660
Maybe this won't be
such a slow roast in hell.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.098
[whispers]: I'm sorry.
He invited himself.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.624
Black and white? Aw.

12:35.711 --> 12:38.192
This better change in the middle
like in The Wizard of Oz.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.846
Shh.

12:41.021 --> 12:43.284
And subtitles, too?

12:43.371 --> 12:45.416
Ugh. It's like
seeing a boring movie

12:45.503 --> 12:47.984
and reading a horrible book
at the same time.

12:49.072 --> 12:51.031
Shh.

12:54.034 --> 12:57.254
400 Blows.
They got half that title right.

13:00.823 --> 13:03.086
Do not shush me,
Willie Nelson.

13:05.523 --> 13:08.048
Mike, unless you can
sit here like a grown-up

13:08.135 --> 13:11.007
and not complain constantly,
go wait in the lobby.

13:11.094 --> 13:12.182
You'd like that.

13:12.269 --> 13:14.010
Yeah, we all would.

13:15.751 --> 13:18.754
I'll be in the lobby.

13:18.841 --> 13:22.018
You have any quarters? They
got a Ms. Pac-Manout there.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.803
Okay, all right.

13:26.936 --> 13:29.983
[sighs] Well, that
was very enjoyable.

13:30.070 --> 13:30.853
Oh, I'm so glad
you liked it.

13:30.940 --> 13:33.029
Truffaut's a genius.

13:33.116 --> 13:34.814
I mean... two hours
you're just transported

13:34.901 --> 13:36.337
to Paris in the '50s.
Mm-hmm.

13:36.424 --> 13:37.947
Yeah, great.
What's for dinner?

13:38.034 --> 13:39.470
Sushi.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.516
[blows raspberry]

13:41.603 --> 13:43.257
How about pizza?

13:43.344 --> 13:45.041
Carl and I already
decided on sushi.

13:45.128 --> 13:47.435
Really, is that
what you want, Carl?

13:47.522 --> 13:49.480
A slimy squirt
of tuna on rice?

13:49.567 --> 13:50.960
Hey, I will go wherever
the two of you decide.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.919
Great. Carl wants pizza.

13:53.006 --> 13:56.748
He didn't say that.
Just go to the sushi place.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.489
Don't let her bully you, Carl.

13:58.576 --> 13:59.882
Stick to the plan, Carl.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.710
I'm your partner, Carl.

14:01.797 --> 14:03.886
Dance with the one
who brung you, Carl.

14:03.973 --> 14:05.148
Do the right thing, Carl.

14:05.235 --> 14:05.975
Be a man, Carl.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.462
I can't believe
he dumped us.

14:14.549 --> 14:15.071
I can.

14:19.336 --> 14:22.078
Well, that evening was a bust.

14:22.165 --> 14:25.560
At least I taped
the Bulls game.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.170
Are you serious?

14:27.257 --> 14:28.041
Oh, yeah. I made sure
not to look online

14:28.128 --> 14:30.173
or pass any televisions.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.915
I didn't even talk
to people wearing red.

14:33.002 --> 14:36.571
Be like getting two and a half
hours of my life back.

14:36.658 --> 14:38.007
Oh, must be a big game.

14:38.094 --> 14:39.008
Yeah.

14:39.095 --> 14:40.923
Yeah. Tough opponent?

14:41.010 --> 14:42.316
Oh, yeah, the Pacers.

14:42.403 --> 14:43.970
Oh, man.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.580
'Cause the Bulls win by three.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.669
Aah!

14:49.584 --> 14:50.672
What are you doing?

14:50.759 --> 14:52.761
You ruined the game for me.

14:52.848 --> 14:53.631
Oh, did I?

14:53.718 --> 14:56.025
Ugh. I'm sorry.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.897
That's real mature.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.769
I'm mature... Really?

15:00.856 --> 15:01.857
Okay, why did you
even come tonight?

15:01.944 --> 15:04.381
I don't know.

15:04.468 --> 15:05.948
I do.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.081
I think you're jealous
of me and Carl.

15:08.168 --> 15:11.171
I'm not jealous-jealous.

15:11.258 --> 15:13.825
I'm just uncomfortable with
you sharing stuff with Carl

15:13.913 --> 15:15.479
and doing stuff that I can't.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.177
It's not that you can't;
it's that you won't.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.700
Or... you don't.

15:18.787 --> 15:20.310
I went to that
dance class with you,

15:20.397 --> 15:21.964
and I didn't want to do that.

15:22.051 --> 15:24.532
Yeah, I know, because
you complained all night.

15:24.619 --> 15:27.317
That's why it was more
fun to go with Carl.

15:27.404 --> 15:30.190
I'm sorry, I can't
dance like Carl.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.235
Well, nobody can.
He's amazing.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.674
Okay, that's...
that's not the point.

15:36.761 --> 15:39.068
The point is that I...
I would've preferred

15:39.155 --> 15:41.244
to be dancing
with you all night.

15:41.331 --> 15:42.071
Why? I suck.

15:42.158 --> 15:44.160
Well, so do I.

15:44.247 --> 15:45.031
That's the fun of it.

Sucking together.

15:48.121 --> 15:50.166
Move.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.954
You know how great it
would've been if you...

15:55.041 --> 15:57.478
just would have tried
the salsa classes with me

15:57.565 --> 16:00.133
or sat through
that boring movie?

16:00.220 --> 16:01.134
So you admit it was boring.

16:01.221 --> 16:03.223
Of course it was boring.

16:03.310 --> 16:06.356
It was an old,
pretentious French movie.

16:06.443 --> 16:09.925
Then we could have gone
and hated it together,

16:10.012 --> 16:13.146
then come home and made
fun of it together.

16:13.233 --> 16:14.974
I didn't know
that was an option.

16:15.061 --> 16:18.586
'Cause you
didn't even try.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.675
Which is all I ask.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.983
Okay.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.941
I get it.

16:26.028 --> 16:28.465
I need to try more stuff
that you love

16:28.552 --> 16:30.946
so we can hate it together.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.992
[laughing]:
No, not...

16:33.079 --> 16:35.690
Not just what I like...

16:35.777 --> 16:39.563
We can... we can hate
what you love, too.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.435
Really?

16:41.522 --> 16:43.567
'Cause there's someplace
I've always wanted to take you,

16:43.654 --> 16:44.699
but I didn't think
you'd like it.

Really? Where?
Well, I...

16:46.353 --> 16:47.789
Oh, God, no, wait.
Don't tell me.

16:47.876 --> 16:49.225
Okay, tell me.

don't. [giggles]

17:08.157 --> 17:09.550
This is awesome.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.508
Why did you think
I would hate this?

17:11.595 --> 17:13.554
Because you don't like guns.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.425
I don't.

17:15.512 --> 17:18.080
But I love shooting them.
We should get bigger guns.

Slow down, Annie Oakley.

our entire lives ahead of us.

to class anymore, right?

me something about salsa.

something about cinema.
