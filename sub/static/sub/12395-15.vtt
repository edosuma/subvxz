WEBVTT

00:06.100 --> 00:08.364
- AND WE ARE LIVE
OUTSIDE OF LOMPOC STATE PRISON,

00:08.400 --> 00:10.709
WHERE, ANY MOMENT NOW,
THESE GATES WILL OPEN,

00:10.740 --> 00:12.503
AND OUT WILL WALK THANE WOODSON.

00:12.540 --> 00:15.703
WOODSON'S CONVICTION FOR ROBBING
A LOCAL SANTA BARBARA RESTAURANT

00:15.740 --> 00:18.777
WAS OVERTURNED AFTER LAWYERS
FROM THE INNOCENCE PROJECT

00:18.810 --> 00:21.540
WERE ABLE TO GET FAULTY
EYEWITN ESS TESTIMONY TH ROWN OUT.

00:21.580 --> 00:22.683
WE'RE EXPECTING A STATEMENT.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.085
LET'S GO.
HE'S HERE RIGHT NOW.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.714
[reporters shouting]

00:26.760 --> 00:29.558
- TODAY IS ANOTHER GREAT DAY
FOR JUSTICE

00:29.590 --> 00:32.127
AND A GREAT DAY
FOR THE INNOCENCE PROJECT.

00:32.160 --> 00:34.094
UM, THIS MOMENT,
A MOMENT OF JOY,

00:34.130 --> 00:36.166
RECONCILIATION,
AND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE,

00:36.200 --> 00:38.589
REMINDS US
OF OUR COMMON HUMANITY.

00:38.630 --> 00:40.234
- I LOST EVERYTHING!
I WANT IT BACK!

00:40.270 --> 00:41.134
Y'ALL OWE ME!

00:41.170 --> 00:42.637
- OKAY, WHAT MY CLIENT MEANS
IS THAT--

00:42.670 --> 00:45.161
- AND THE STATE PENAL CODE 4903

00:45.210 --> 00:46.529
STATES THAT I'M OWED
RESTITUTION.

00:46.580 --> 00:47.672
I KNOW MY RIGHTS.

00:47.710 --> 00:49.109
I HAVE A LAW DEGREE.

00:49.150 --> 00:50.208
- OKAY, HE DOESN'T HAVE
A LAW DEGREE.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.171
- I'M CLOSE.

00:51.210 --> 00:52.848
- OKAY, HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN
SOME CLASSES.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.212
- BUT IN THE EYES OF THE STATE,
HE'S NOT DUE RESTITUTION

00:55.250 --> 00:57.810
UNTIL THE REAL CULPRIT
IS CAPTURED AND PROVEN GUILTY.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.078
- THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO, THEN.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.314
AFTER I GET MY LAW DEGREE,

01:00.360 --> 01:02.089
I'LL ENROLL
IN THE POLICE ACADEMY

01:02.130 --> 01:03.256
AND BECOME A DETECTIVE.

01:03.290 --> 01:05.155
- OKAY, HE'S NOT ENROLLING
IN THE ACADEMY.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.090
- THEN I WILL FIND
SOMEBODY ELSE TO HELP ME.

01:07.130 --> 01:08.449
'SCUSE ME.

01:14.140 --> 01:16.131
- SO YOU WANT US
TO SOLVE THE CRIME

01:16.170 --> 01:17.000
THAT YOU WERE
WRONGFULLY CONVICTED OF.

01:17.040 --> 01:19.270
- I HEARD YOU
ONE HELL OF A PSYCHIC

01:19.310 --> 01:20.709
FROM THE VERY MEN
THAT YOU PUT IN JAIL.

01:20.740 --> 01:22.605
- WELL, THAT'S NOT SURPRISING.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.504
I'M SURE MY REPUTATION
IN PRISON

01:24.550 --> 01:26.279
HAS REACH ED MYTHICAL
PROPORTIONS.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.070
- NOT REALLY,

01:27.120 --> 01:29.247
BUT THERE IS A LONG LIST
OF FELLAS

01:29.290 --> 01:30.382
FIXIN' TO KILL YOU
SOON AS THEY GET OUT.

01:30.420 --> 01:32.354
- WHY JUST ME?
THIS IS A TWO-MAN TEAM.

01:32.390 --> 01:35.314
- STOP SNITCHING, SHAWN.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.679
- HERE'S MY CASE FILE.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.358
YEAH, I DID SOME HARD TIME

01:39.400 --> 01:43.359
IN VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA
PENAL CODES 459 AND 211.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.391
- RUBBED UP AGAINST A WOMAN
ON A SUBWAY.

01:45.430 --> 01:46.795
OH, NO, WAIT.
THAT'S--

01:46.840 --> 01:48.364
THAT'S 458.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.901
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

01:49.940 --> 01:51.259
- IT'S BURGLARY
AND ARMED ROBBERY.

01:51.310 --> 01:53.528
MY CLIENT IS WELL VERSED
IN LEGAL MA'I'I'ERS.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.275
- OH, YOU BE'I'I'ER RECOGNIZE.

01:55.310 --> 01:56.277
- OH, THAT'S HORRIBLE, MAN.

01:56.310 --> 01:57.447
YOU MUST'VE LOST EVERYTHING.

01:57.480 --> 02:02.508
HOW LONG
WERE YOU INCARCERATED?

02:02.550 --> 02:04.415
- TWO YEARS, EIGHT MONTHS.

02:04.450 --> 02:06.554
- [whistles]
- WOW.

02:06.590 --> 02:08.785
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

02:08.820 --> 02:09.923
- I WAS GETTING READY
TO SAY--

02:09.960 --> 02:11.279
- IT'S A LONG-ASS TIME,
I KNOW.

02:11.330 --> 02:12.820
- [doubtfully]
MM--

02:12.860 --> 02:15.249
- SO EVEN THOUGH THE CONVICTIONS
WERE OVERTURNED,

02:15.300 --> 02:16.790
WE STILL MUST PROVE THAT THANE
DIDN'T COMMIT THE CRIMES

02:16.830 --> 02:17.762
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

02:17.800 --> 02:19.233
AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT
WOULD BE TO FIND

02:19.270 --> 02:21.295
THE PERSON THAT ACTUALLY DID.

02:21.340 --> 02:22.329
THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.

02:22.370 --> 02:24.201
- HMM.

02:24.240 --> 02:27.539
'SCUSE US ONE SECOND.

02:27.580 --> 02:28.808
- WHAT YOU THINK?
- I DON'T KNOW.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.171
THIS GUY COULD BE
A HANDFUL.

02:30.210 --> 02:31.302
- WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

02:31.350 --> 02:32.908
- YOU SAW PENITENTIARY.
- WHICH ONE?

02:32.950 --> 02:35.339
- ALL THREE OF 'EM.

02:35.380 --> 02:36.586
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I GOT THIS.

02:36.620 --> 02:38.884
HERE'S THE THING, THANE.

02:38.920 --> 02:40.888
THERE IS NOT A DOUBT
IN OUR MINDS

02:40.920 --> 02:41.887
THAT YOU'RE AN INNOCENT MAN.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.184
BUT THIS IS A LOT
FOR A COUPLE DUDES LIKE US

02:44.230 --> 02:45.652
TO TAKE ON, AND--

02:45.690 --> 02:48.693
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY PRETTY BUSY
AT THE MOMENT.

02:52.270 --> 02:53.692
UM, DAMN.

02:53.740 --> 02:54.866
I'M AFRAID WE'RE JUST--

02:54.900 --> 02:56.367
WE'RE NOT UP FOR THIS ONE.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.206
- YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND
IT'S A LOT

02:57.240 --> 02:59.231
FOR ME TO COME IN HERE
AND ASK YOU

02:59.280 --> 03:02.374
TO FIGHT MY FIGHT FOR ME.

03:02.410 --> 03:04.344
BUT I LOST EVERYTHING.

03:04.380 --> 03:05.506
[sentimental music]

03:05.550 --> 03:09.281
I WAS ONCE JUST LIKE YOU.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.948
I HAD DREAMS.

03:11.990 --> 03:12.979
I HAD A GIRL.

03:13.020 --> 03:14.282
- GUS DOESN'T HAVE A GIRL.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.719
- SHAWN.

03:15.760 --> 03:19.924
- I COULDN'T HAVE MY GIRL WAIT
10 TO 15 YEARS FOR ME.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.360
SO I TOLD HER, "YOU GO OUT,
AND YOU FIND SOMEBODY

03:22.400 --> 03:24.823
"THAT'LL MAKE YOU HAPPY.

03:24.870 --> 03:26.428
"SOMEBODY THAT CAN MAKE
PHONE CALLS

03:26.470 --> 03:28.893
FOR AT LEAST
MORE THAN 15 MINUTES."

03:28.940 --> 03:33.730
SHE GOT MARRIED
WHILE I WAS STUCK IN JAIL.

03:33.780 --> 03:39.412
I KNOW IT'S ONLY BEEN TWO YEARS
AND EIGHT MONTHS, BUT...

03:39.450 --> 03:40.815
I'M STARTING FROM SCRATCH.

03:40.850 --> 03:42.886
SO PLEASE...

03:42.920 --> 03:45.741
HELP ME FIGHT
THE INJUSTICE

03:45.790 --> 03:49.487
THAT WAS DONE TO ME.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.521
- [exhales heavily]

03:55.600 --> 03:57.329
[whispering]
MAN, I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

03:57.370 --> 03:58.428
- [whispering]
HE SET HIS GIRL FREE.

03:58.470 --> 03:59.630
LIKE IN HURRICANE.

03:59.670 --> 04:03.265
- SHE GOT MARRIED QUICK.
- I KNOW.

04:03.310 --> 04:06.006
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
WE'RE GONNA HELP!

04:06.040 --> 04:08.372
- YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HAPPY
YOU MAKE A BROTHER FEEL, MAN.

04:08.410 --> 04:10.048
NOW COME HERE TO ME!
- [groans]

04:10.080 --> 04:13.277
- YEAH, I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I'VE NEVER HAD A CAUSE BEFORE.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.571
THIS IS AWESOME.

04:14.620 --> 04:15.871
WE'RE GONNA FIGHT THE POWER!

04:15.920 --> 04:16.909
- FIGHT THE POWER!
- TOGETHER!

04:16.950 --> 04:17.917
- TOGETHER!

04:17.950 --> 04:19.315
- SHAWN, DON'T GET ALL SPIKE LEE

04:19.360 --> 04:23.285
AND DO THE RIGHT THING
ON ME.

04:23.330 --> 04:25.355
- IT'S TOO LATE
FOR THAT, BROTHER.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.449
LOVE IS GONNA BUST HIM OUT.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.649
- HE'S ALREADY OUT, SHAWN.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.429
- JUST 'CAUSE YOU PUT SYRUP
ON SOMETHING

04:30.470 --> 04:31.391
DON'T MAKE IT PANCAKES.

04:31.430 --> 04:33.432
- WHAT?

04:40.980 --> 04:42.948
- HEY, JULES.

04:42.980 --> 04:44.402
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE
THE CASE WE JUST LANDED.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.042
WE'RE BASICALLY
CIVIC HEROES NOW.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.570
- I PREFER FREEDOM FIGHTERS.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.769
- UH-HUH.

04:48.820 --> 04:50.515
- WHAT WE'RE DOING
IS MUCH MORE EXCITING

04:50.550 --> 04:52.609
THAN ANYTHING YOU WILL HAVE
GOING ON INSIDE THERE.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.309
- NOTHING IN THERE IS AS COOL
AS WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT HERE.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.328
- OH, I AM SURE YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.452
- WE ARE.

04:57.490 --> 04:58.889
- OKAY, I'LL BITE.

04:58.930 --> 05:00.329
WHAT'S THE CASE?

05:00.360 --> 05:01.850
- WELL, IN ORDER TO REALLY
APPRECIATE IT,

05:01.900 --> 05:03.060
YOU HAVE TO FIRST HEAR
THE BACKSTORY.

05:03.100 --> 05:04.988
- YEAH.

05:05.030 --> 05:06.895
[somberly]
ONCE UPON A TIME,

05:06.940 --> 05:08.669
A POOR COUNTRY BOY
IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE

05:08.700 --> 05:10.531
BRUSHES OFF HIS OVERALLS,
HOPS ON A FREIGHT,

05:10.570 --> 05:12.674
AND LEAVES THE DUSTY ROADS
OF GEORGIA BEHIND.

05:12.710 --> 05:14.598
- SHAWN, THAT'S GRAPES OF WRATH,
AND IT WASN'T A FREIGHT,

05:14.640 --> 05:15.777
AND IT WASN'T GEORGIA.

05:15.810 --> 05:16.845
THANE WASN'T ALIVE THEN.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.472
- HE HAD NO FORMAL EDUCATION,

05:18.510 --> 05:20.341
BUT HE DID KNOW 100 USES
FOR THE PEANUT.

05:20.380 --> 05:21.711
- THAT'S
GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.945
THANE HAS A MASTER'S
IN CULINARY ARTS.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.811
- SO HE MOVED TO SANTA BARBARA
AND BOUGHT A HORSE.

05:26.860 --> 05:27.815
- THAT'S TRUE.

05:27.860 --> 05:28.884
- AND IN NO TIME AT ALL,

05:28.920 --> 05:30.353
HE GOT A JOB
AS A HEAD CHEF.

05:30.390 --> 05:31.857
THEN HIS LIFE TOOK
A TRAGIC TURN

05:31.890 --> 05:33.494
WHEN HIS RESTAURANT
WAS ROBBED.

05:33.530 --> 05:36.363
- HE WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.095
- GOT ARRESTED, SPENT TH REE
LONG YEARS IN THE BIG HOUSE.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.690
- NOT THE CLINK.
- FOR A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

05:40.740 --> 05:41.695
- WHY?

05:41.740 --> 05:43.139
- FAULTY EYEWITN ESS TESTIMONY,

05:43.170 --> 05:44.899
UNFAIR JUSTICE SYSTEM,
AND--

05:44.940 --> 05:47.033
- ME.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.139
- TRYING TO MAKE THIS ABOUT YOU.
- OH, BOY.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.477
- THIS IS OUR CASE.

05:50.510 --> 05:52.410
- YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT THANE WOODSON,

05:52.450 --> 05:54.509
AND THAT RESTAURANT ROBBERY
WAS MY CASE.

06:05.730 --> 06:07.721
[tires squeal]

06:15.070 --> 06:18.801
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

06:18.840 --> 06:21.934
*

06:21.980 --> 06:23.072
- * IN BETWEEN THE LINES

06:23.110 --> 06:25.772
* THERE'S A LOT
OF OBSCURITY *

06:25.810 --> 06:27.038
* I'M NOT INCLINED

06:27.080 --> 06:29.412
* TO RESIGN TO MATURITY

06:29.450 --> 06:31.145
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT

06:31.190 --> 06:32.418
* THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG

06:32.460 --> 06:34.712
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND

06:34.760 --> 06:36.887
* TO THE SAME DAMN SONG

06:36.930 --> 06:42.869
* YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN'T CRAWL *

06:42.900 --> 06:45.460
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

06:45.500 --> 06:46.797
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

06:46.840 --> 06:48.762
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

06:48.800 --> 06:50.165
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

06:50.210 --> 06:52.098
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

06:52.140 --> 06:53.072
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

06:53.110 --> 06:55.101
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

06:55.140 --> 06:57.677
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

07:05.720 --> 07:07.711
- I SPENT THREE WEEKS
ON THIS CASE.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.557
I FOUND THE GUN THAT WAS USED
IN THE ROBBERY

07:09.590 --> 07:11.649
IN THANE'S CAR,
WITH HIS PRINTS ON IT.

07:11.690 --> 07:12.998
- ALLEGEDLY.

07:13.030 --> 07:14.657
- HE'S DEFINITELY GUILTY.

07:14.700 --> 07:15.826
- I DON'T KNOW, JULES.

07:15.860 --> 07:17.896
THERE'S A GRAND JURY THAT
DISAGREES WITH YOU ON THAT.

07:17.930 --> 07:20.034
- SO YOU TWO BREAKING UP
OVER THIS?

07:20.070 --> 07:21.662
- NO.
- OF COURSE NOT.

07:21.700 --> 07:22.735
- WELL, DON'T FORGET,

07:22.770 --> 07:24.601
I USED TO BE INVOLVED
WITH SOMEONE ON THE FORCE,

07:24.640 --> 07:26.198
AND IT GETS VERY TRICKY
KEEPING WORK ISSUES

07:26.240 --> 07:27.707
FROM BECOMING PERSONAL.

07:27.740 --> 07:29.708
NOW THAT I'M DATING
AN INCARCERATED CIVILIAN,

07:29.750 --> 07:31.103
THINGS ARE MUCH SIMPLER.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.618
MINUS THE 2" GLASS
AND THE LEG SHACKLES.

07:33.650 --> 07:37.518
- WELL, WE APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN, CARLTON.

07:37.550 --> 07:38.687
BUT I DON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY

07:38.720 --> 07:40.756
THAT SHAWN TOOK ON
THANE'S CASE,

07:40.790 --> 07:43.224
EVEN THOUGH I AM FAIRLY CERTAIN
THAT HE IS GUILTY.

07:43.260 --> 07:44.227
- AND I DON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY

07:44.260 --> 07:45.784
THAT JULIET FEELS THAT WAY,

07:45.830 --> 07:48.628
EVEN THOUGH SHE SIMPLY
COULDN'T BE WRONGER.

07:48.660 --> 07:49.763
- YOU TWO ARE SO BREAKING UP
OVER THIS.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.722
AND SPENCER, REMEMBER,

07:51.770 --> 07:52.634
ALL CONVICT S SAY
THEY'RE INNOCENT,

07:52.670 --> 07:55.764
OR THEY'RE FRAMED,
OR STOP CHOKING ME.

07:55.800 --> 07:56.835
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

07:56.870 --> 07:59.737
THANE WOODSON IS DEFINITELY
GUILTY OF SOMETHING.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.975
- NOT ACCORDING
TO THE INNOCENCE PROJECT.

08:02.010 --> 08:03.898
- WHICH IS WHY THEY'RE HIGH
ON MY LIST OF ENEMIES.

08:03.950 --> 08:07.772
RIGHT BEHIND INTERNAL AFFAIRS,
UNICEF, AND LANCE BASS.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.117
DON'T ASK.

08:09.150 --> 08:12.551
- LOOK, I AM CONFIDENT
THAT I DID GOOD POLICE WORK.

08:12.590 --> 08:13.818
- I AM SURE YOU DID, JULES,

08:13.860 --> 08:15.680
BUT WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES,
RIGHT?

08:15.720 --> 08:18.188
SO YOU PUT AN INNOCENT MAN
BEHIND BARS FOR THREE YEARS.

08:18.230 --> 08:20.118
I THREW OUT
THE COMICS YESTERDAY

08:20.160 --> 08:21.821
BEFORE GUS HAD A CHANCE
TO READ FOXTROT.

08:21.860 --> 08:23.191
- SHAWN.
- LISTEN.

08:23.230 --> 08:25.027
ACCORDING
TO THE INNOCENCE PROJECT,

08:25.070 --> 08:27.561
THE RESTAURANT OWNER
WHO I.D.'D THANE

08:27.600 --> 08:29.704
WAS USING GLASSES
WITH AN EXPIRED PRESCRIPTION.

08:29.740 --> 08:32.732
- WELL, THEN, IT'S
THE D.A.'S FAULT

08:32.780 --> 08:34.179
FOR USING EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY
AS THE CRUX OF THE CASE.

08:34.210 --> 08:36.098
- I AGREE.
THE D.A. IS TO BLAME.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.676
NOW I'M GONNA MAKE IT RIGHT.

08:37.710 --> 08:40.679
I'M GONNA GO FIGHT
FOR THANE.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.609
ME.

08:43.650 --> 08:44.719
- [sighs]

08:44.750 --> 08:47.719
- SO WHEN THINGS FALL APART
WITH SPENCER AND YOU,

08:47.760 --> 08:51.252
MARLOWE AND I HAVE MET
THE PERFECT PERSON.

08:51.290 --> 08:53.155
- THAT MEANS THAT PERSON
IS IN PRISON

08:53.200 --> 08:54.724
AND IS A WOMAN.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.819
- WHICH ONE OF THOSE
IS A PROBLEM?

09:05.140 --> 09:06.869
- TABLE FOUR IS UP.

09:06.910 --> 09:08.901
- LOOK, WE APPRECIATE YOU
TAKING SOME TIME

09:08.940 --> 09:09.872
TO SPEAK WITH US, MERCER.

09:09.910 --> 09:11.639
YOU HAVE A LOVELY RESTAURANT,
BY THE WAY.

09:11.680 --> 09:12.749
- THANK YOU.

09:12.780 --> 09:15.044
- I ASSUME YOU KNOW THAT THANE
HAS BEEN EXONERATED?

09:15.080 --> 09:16.809
- YES, I DO.
- LISTEN.

09:16.850 --> 09:20.786
I DON'T WANT TO CREATE
AN AWKWARD SITUATION, BUT...

09:20.820 --> 09:23.152
I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER THE MAN
YOUR TESTIMONY PUT IN JAIL.

09:23.190 --> 09:25.784
- LOOK, I DON'T WANT
ANY TROUBLE, ALL RIGHT?

09:25.830 --> 09:27.354
I FEEL HORRIBLE
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.790
- MM-HMM.

09:30.830 --> 09:34.596
YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:34.640 --> 09:36.767
WE CAN END THE CYCLE
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

09:36.810 --> 09:40.007
[ominous music]

09:40.040 --> 09:42.235
I FORGIVE YOU, MAN.
COME ON.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.770
- I'M SORRY MAN, ALL RIGHT?

09:43.810 --> 09:45.698
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU WERE ALWAYS MY BEST COOK.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.240
AND I DIDN'T THINK
IN A MILLION YEARS

09:47.280 --> 09:48.372
YOU COULD DO ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.

09:48.420 --> 09:49.170
BUT THE POLICE TOLD ME

09:49.220 --> 09:50.710
THAT THE GUN USED
IN THE ROBBERY

09:50.750 --> 09:51.842
WAS FOUND IN YOUR CAR.
- MM-HMM.

09:51.890 --> 09:52.879
- THEY TOLD ME
THE ROBBERY SMACKED

09:52.920 --> 09:54.012
OF AN INSIDE JOB.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.755
I WAS UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE
TO SAY IT WAS YOU, MAN.

09:55.790 --> 09:56.757
I'M SORRY.

09:56.790 --> 09:57.722
- I GET IT, YEAH.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.921
YOU KNOW THE FUNNY THING
ABOUT PRESSURE IS...

09:59.960 --> 10:02.099
I WENT TO JAIL
BECAUSE OF YOU!

10:03.670 --> 10:04.967
- HEY, I SAID I'M SORRY, MAN.
RELAX, ALL RIGHT?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.797
- I LOST MY YOUTH
BECAUSE OF YOU!

10:06.840 --> 10:07.499
- YOU'RE ONLY TWO YEARS OLDER.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.235
- HEY, MAN,
I'M A DINOSAUR!

10:09.270 --> 10:10.737
- YOU ARE NOT A DINOSAUR.

10:10.770 --> 10:13.830
THIS IS NOT HELPING
YOUR CAUSE.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.836
- OKAY.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.075
MY BAD.

10:18.110 --> 10:19.304
IT'S THIS--

10:19.350 --> 10:20.942
THIS PRISON THING
GOT A HOLD OF ME, MAN.

10:20.980 --> 10:22.743
- TIGHT.

10:22.790 --> 10:23.779
- STILL CONTROLLING ME, I MEAN.
- YEAH.

10:23.820 --> 10:26.038
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

10:31.260 --> 10:33.990
- SO WE NEED YOU TO TELL US
EVERYTHING YOU CAN REMEMBER

10:34.030 --> 10:35.327
ABOUT THE NIGHT
OF THE ROBBERY.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.294
- YEAH, OKAY, UM...

10:37.330 --> 10:38.399
I CAME IN RIGHT
AFTER CLOSING TIME,

10:38.430 --> 10:40.398
AND THAT'S WHEN I FOUND ONE
OF MY KITCHEN WORKERS

10:40.440 --> 10:42.761
SITTING RIGHT HERE
WITH HIS HANDS TIED

10:42.810 --> 10:45.836
WITH THOSE, UM,
BEADED ZIP TIE THINGS.

10:45.870 --> 10:47.371
NOW, HE WAS RECITING
THE ALPHABET BACKWARDS.

10:47.410 --> 10:48.729
- OOH, ALPHABET.

10:48.780 --> 10:50.873
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE
THE SAME M.O.

10:50.910 --> 10:52.138
OF THE UNSOLVED
CONVENIENCE STORE ROBBERY

10:52.180 --> 10:53.169
FROM LAST MONTH.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.847
- HE TIED MY HANDS
BEHIND MY BACK

10:54.880 --> 10:57.110
AND, UH, MADE ME RECITE
THE ALPHABET BACKWARDS.

10:57.150 --> 10:58.913
- YOU GUYS KNOW THAT FOOD'S
NOT FREE

10:58.950 --> 11:01.953
JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE WORKING
A CASE, RIGHT?

11:04.160 --> 11:05.286
- NOW, I IMMEDIATELY
UNTIED HIM,

11:05.330 --> 11:06.729
AND THAT'S WHEN I HEARD
THE GUNSHOT

11:06.760 --> 11:07.522
COMING FROM OVER THERE.

11:07.560 --> 11:08.754
NOW, I LOOKED UP,
AND I SAW A MAN

11:08.800 --> 11:10.768
WHO CERTAINLY LOOKED LIKE THANE

11:10.800 --> 11:11.892
CLIMBING OUT
THAT BACK WINDOW.

11:11.930 --> 11:13.761
YOU KNOW,
IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE,

11:13.800 --> 11:14.789
IF YOU COULD EXCUSE ME,
I GOT A LUNCH RUSH

11:14.840 --> 11:15.829
I GOTTA DEAL WITH HERE.

11:15.870 --> 11:16.859
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
EXCUSE YOU?

11:16.910 --> 11:19.037
- EXCUSE ME.
- THINK THIS IS LAW AND ORDER?

11:19.070 --> 11:20.799
YOU DON'T GET TO DECIDE
WHEN THE INTERVIEW'S OVER.

11:20.840 --> 11:21.670
- WE DECIDE.

11:21.710 --> 11:23.177
- JUST GO BACK
TO MAKING SOME SAUCE.

11:23.210 --> 11:24.802
PSH. GOT ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY
TO THIS DUDE?

11:24.850 --> 11:26.203
- NOT AT ALL.
- OKAY, GUESS WHAT.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.774
- NOW IT'S OVER.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.344
- NOW THE INTERVIEW IS OVER.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.189
AND WE'RE GONNA LEAVE,
'CAUSE WE MADE THE RULES.

11:31.220 --> 11:35.759
I'LL WASH MY HANDS
OF YOU, SIR.

11:35.790 --> 11:38.327
MAN, WHAT IF THE SAME DUDE
WHO ROBBED STOP-N-GULP

11:38.360 --> 11:39.918
ROBBED THIS PLACE
TH REE YEARS AGO?

11:39.960 --> 11:41.029
- THEN WE COULD SOLVE
THAT CASE

11:41.060 --> 11:42.823
AND LINK THE BAD GUY
TO THIS ROBBERY.

11:42.870 --> 11:43.666
_ THANE'S PROVEN INNOCENT,

11:43.700 --> 11:44.860
GETS HIS SETTLEMENT
FROM THE STATE.

11:44.900 --> 11:46.788
- AND A CHANCE AT A NEW LIFE,
LIKE IN CARLITO'S WAY.

11:46.840 --> 11:47.864
- 'TIL THE GAME
PULLS HIM BACK IN.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.037
- WHICH YOU KNOW IT WILL.

11:49.070 --> 11:50.332
- I GOT ALL THIS SOAP
ON MY HAND.

11:50.370 --> 11:52.099
- THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR TRYING TO BE BAD.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.299
- I'M HAVING
A PSYCHIC SUSPICION

11:58.350 --> 12:00.113
THAT THE PERSON
WHO ROBBED YOU LAST MONTH

12:00.150 --> 12:03.039
COMMITTED A SIMILAR CRIME
TH REE YEARS AGO.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.785
- UH, DON'T LOOK NOW,
BUT I THINK THAT'S THE GUY

12:04.820 --> 12:06.219
THAT ROBBED US.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.182
- WHAT?

12:07.220 --> 12:08.983
- WE TOLD YOU TO WAIT
AT THE PSYCH OFFICE.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.123
- HOW DID YOU EVEN GET HERE?

12:10.160 --> 12:11.058
- I RODE MY BIKE.

12:11.090 --> 12:12.990
AND I AM SICK AND TIRED
OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU

12:13.030 --> 12:15.157
SAYING I FIT THE DESCRIPTION
OF A CRIMINAL.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.349
- SORRY, DUDE.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.765
MAYBE YOU SHOULD,
I DON'T KNOW,

12:17.800 --> 12:18.789
LOOK DIFFERENT OR SOMETHING.

12:18.830 --> 12:20.798
- LOOK DI--
NO.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.161
YOU KNOW WHAT'S SORRY?

12:23.210 --> 12:24.905
THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM,

12:24.940 --> 12:26.498
WHERE I SPENT THREE YEARS.

12:26.540 --> 12:28.178
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WAS
TWO YEARS AND EIGHT MONTHS.

12:28.210 --> 12:30.246
- I'M ROUNDING UP,
ALL RIGHT?

12:30.280 --> 12:31.907
AND WHO ARE YOU?
THE MATH POLICE?

12:31.950 --> 12:34.475
- WHY DON'T YOU ICE CUBE IT DOWN
A NOTCH OR TWO OR FIVE?

12:34.520 --> 12:35.509
- YEAH.
- OKAY, COOL, MY BAD.

12:35.550 --> 12:37.313
- OKAY.
- WE GOOD?

12:37.350 --> 12:38.817
HEY, SNOWFLAKE.

12:38.850 --> 12:39.885
- THERE IT IS.
- COME ON, COME ON.

12:39.920 --> 12:40.614
COME ON, COME ON.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.252
IT'S COOL, ALL RIGHT?
WE GOOD?

12:42.290 --> 12:43.359
- YEAH.
- WE GOOD?

12:43.390 --> 12:45.881
- THAT'S THE REAL THING,
RIGHT THERE.

12:45.930 --> 12:47.795
- WE GOOD.
- FOR REAL.

12:47.830 --> 12:50.424
- PRISON.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.836
BUT WE GOOD.

12:52.870 --> 12:54.565
- I'M ALSO SENSING THAT
YOU'RE, UH,

12:54.600 --> 12:56.295
YOU'RE NOT REALLY STRESSING
THE ROBBERY

12:56.340 --> 12:57.830
BECAUSE YOU'RE FULLY
INSURED HERE.

12:57.870 --> 12:59.064
- I WISH.

12:59.110 --> 13:00.407
THE INSURANCE ADJUSTER
JUST CALLED,

13:00.440 --> 13:02.579
AND APPARENTLY,
THE STORE ALARM WAS ON,

13:02.610 --> 13:04.578
BUT THE ZONE BY THE BACK WINDOW
WHERE THE BURGLAR ESCAPED

13:04.610 --> 13:06.077
WASN'T WORKING.

13:06.110 --> 13:07.941
SO NOW IT'S MY FAULT.

13:07.980 --> 13:10.949
- OH, YOUR LIFE SUCKS.

13:15.190 --> 13:16.509
I'M ALSO SENSING
THAT YOU DID SOME WORK HERE

13:16.560 --> 13:17.857
TO THE STORE
BEFORE THE BREAK-IN.

13:17.890 --> 13:18.857
IS THAT RIGHT?

13:18.890 --> 13:19.788
- YEAH, ACTUALLY.

13:19.830 --> 13:23.163
WE HAD SOME RENOVATIONS
A FEW DAYS BEFORE.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.418
- HEY, THAT'S NICE, SHAWN.

13:25.470 --> 13:26.960
HEY, SAY, MAN.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.399
HOW'D YOU GET LIKE THAT?

13:28.440 --> 13:30.499
HUH? DID SOMETHING KICK YOU
IN THE HEAD?

13:30.540 --> 13:31.905
- OH.

13:31.940 --> 13:33.339
- YOU GOT CREOLE
IN YOUR BLOOD?

13:33.380 --> 13:34.108
- [laughing]

13:34.140 --> 13:36.574
NO, THANE,
MUCH LIKE LADY GAGA,

13:36.610 --> 13:37.440
I WAS BORN THIS WAY.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.607
AND WHILE I DON'T HAVE
A MEAT DRESS,

13:39.650 --> 13:42.346
I DO HAVE A TIE MADE
ENTIRELY OF BEEF JERKY.

13:42.380 --> 13:43.586
- IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL ME
THE TRUTH, SHAWN,

13:43.620 --> 13:45.019
JUST SAY SO.
DON'T LIE TO ME.

13:45.050 --> 13:46.859
- NO, IT'S TRUE.
BEEF JERKY.

13:46.890 --> 13:48.016
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.618
- OH, HELLO, FATHER.

13:49.660 --> 13:51.958
- HEY, SHAWN, YOU STILL WORKING
THE ZIP TIES LEAD

13:51.990 --> 13:52.957
FOR THANE WOODSON?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.058
- YEAH, WHY?

13:54.100 --> 13:55.988
- WE JUST GOT A CALL
ABOUT A JEWELRY STORE ROBBERY.

13:56.030 --> 13:58.362
GUESS WHAT THE ROBBER USED
TO TIE UP THE SALES CLERK WITH.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.594
- A BUNCH OF BUREAUCRATIC
RED TAPE?

13:59.630 --> 14:00.858
RED VIN ES?
WHAT?

14:00.900 --> 14:03.630
- BEADED ZIP TIES.
- HERE.

14:03.670 --> 14:06.002
- THE EXACT KIND USED
IN THE STOP-N-GULP ROBBERY

14:06.040 --> 14:08.406
AND THE RESTAURANT ROBBERY
THAT THANE WAS ARRESTED FOR.

14:08.440 --> 14:09.941
- KEEP THE CHANGE.
- GET OUTTA HERE.

14:09.980 --> 14:12.972
WE'RE ON IT.
THANK YOU.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.841
DUDE, WE'RE OUT.

14:20.290 --> 14:23.521
[indistinct chatter]

14:23.560 --> 14:24.584
- OH, HI, SHAWN.

14:24.630 --> 14:25.585
- HEY, JULES.

14:25.630 --> 14:27.097
- HEY, CAN WE MOVE DINNER
FROM 7:00 TO 8:00?

14:27.130 --> 14:28.051
THANE IS GUILTY.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.590
- SURE, 8:00 ACTUALLY WORKS
BETTER FOR ME.

14:29.630 --> 14:30.597
HE'S INNOCENT.

14:30.630 --> 14:31.619
- YOU TWO ARE RIDICULOUS.

14:31.670 --> 14:36.369
HE IS INNOCENT.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.231
- YEAH, ACTUALLY,
WE DID SOME RENOVATIONS

14:38.270 --> 14:40.079
A FEW DAYS BEFORE.

14:40.110 --> 14:41.634
HE SAID THE STORE ALARM
WAS ON,

14:41.680 --> 14:43.045
BUT THE ZONE
BY THE BACK WINDOW,

14:43.080 --> 14:45.503
WHERE THE BURGLAR ESCAPED,
WASN'T WORKING.

14:45.550 --> 14:47.575
- ONE, TWO, THREE,
EYES ON ME.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.611
AS THEY SHOULD.

14:49.650 --> 14:51.208
I'M HAVING A PSYCHIC VISION

14:51.250 --> 14:53.354
THAT THERE WAS
A RECENT RENOVATION HERE.

14:53.390 --> 14:55.608
- YES, WE JUST MOVED
THIS WALL BACK.

14:55.660 --> 14:57.127
- OH.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.923
- I'M ALSO SENSING THAT
THE ALARM DIDN'T TRIP

14:58.960 --> 15:00.325
WHEN THE INTRUDER
GAINED ENTRY.

15:00.360 --> 15:01.395
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:01.430 --> 15:03.068
I HAD TO PUSH THE PANIC BUTTON
BEHIND THE COUNTER

15:03.100 --> 15:04.567
TO NOTIFY THE POLICE MYSELF.

15:04.600 --> 15:05.999
- JUST AS I SUSPECTED,

15:06.030 --> 15:07.588
THIS ROBBERY
AND THE STOP-N-GULP ROBBERY

15:07.640 --> 15:08.698
FROM LAST MONTH

15:08.740 --> 15:10.332
WERE COMMITTED
BY THE SAME CULPRIT.

15:10.370 --> 15:11.962
SOMEONE TAMPERED
WITH THE ALARM WIRES

15:12.010 --> 15:13.375
WHILE THE RENOVATIONS
WERE GOING ON

15:13.410 --> 15:14.536
AND THEN BROKE
INTO THE WINDOW,

15:14.580 --> 15:16.946
WHERE THEY KNEW
THE SECURITY BREACH WAS.

15:16.980 --> 15:19.107
- THANK YOU FOR THAT
PRIVATE THEORY, SPENCER.

15:19.150 --> 15:20.276
WE'LL KEEP IT IN MIND
WHEN WE CONDUCT

15:20.320 --> 15:21.571
OUR OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION.

15:21.620 --> 15:24.612
MA'AM, CAN YOU DESCRIBE
THE SUSPECT?

15:24.650 --> 15:27.983
- WELL, HE LOOKED A LOT
LIKE THAT GENTLEMAN RIGHT THERE.

15:28.020 --> 15:29.214
- OH, BOY.

15:29.260 --> 15:32.184
- THANE, HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

15:32.230 --> 15:34.050
- I RODE THE BUS.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.125
AND LADY, I WAS NOWHERE NEAR
YOUR STORE.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.627
- CAN ANYONE CORROBORATE THAT?

15:37.670 --> 15:39.467
- YEAH, TWO OTHER PEOPLE
WHO THOUGHT I ROBBED

15:39.500 --> 15:42.367
TWO OTHER PLACES.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.606
- OKAY, BUT YOU CAN'T BE
HERE ANWVAY,

15:43.640 --> 15:44.607
SO VAMOOSE.

15:44.640 --> 15:45.436
- NO, YOU VAMOOSE, COP.

15:45.470 --> 15:49.702
SANTA BARBARA MUNICIPAL CODE
9.0.001

15:49.740 --> 15:51.401
SAYS THAT I HAVE A RIGHT
TO BE HERE

15:51.450 --> 15:53.247
AS LONG AS I DON'T WANDER,
LINGER,

15:53.280 --> 15:54.975
OR DRIFT IN AN AIMLESS MANNER.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.544
AND I AIM TO HOLLER
AT MY BOY SHAWN.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.047
- HOLLA.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.081
- THAT'S WHY WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW
BOOKS IN PRISON.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.054
OR WATER.

16:02.090 --> 16:05.685
SHOW ME THAT PANIC BUTTON,
PLEASE.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.726
- [clears throat]
UH, THANE,

16:12.770 --> 16:15.659
YOU--YOU REMEMBER
DETECTIVE JULIET O'HARA,

16:15.700 --> 16:18.567
DON'T YOU?

16:18.610 --> 16:21.204
- MM-HMM.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.571
- LOOK, THIS IS HARD
FOR ME TO SAY,

16:22.610 --> 16:25.306
BUT, UH, THE FLAWS
THE INNOCENCE PROJECT FOUND

16:25.350 --> 16:26.544
IN THE CASE
AGAINST YOU--

16:26.580 --> 16:28.070
- MM-HMM?

16:28.120 --> 16:31.112
- ALONG WITH SHAWN'S
PSYCHIC VISION,

16:31.150 --> 16:33.618
MAKES ME WONDER IF I WAS WRONG
ABOUT YOU, THANE.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.615
- MM-HMM.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.581
- I'M THE KIND OF PERSON

16:35.620 --> 16:37.451
THAT WOULD NEVER, EVER,
EVER FORGIVE MYSELF

16:37.490 --> 16:39.378
IF I THOUGHT I'D PUT
THE WRONG PERSON BEHIND BARS.

16:39.430 --> 16:41.796
SO IF THE REAL CULPRIT
IS STILL OUT THERE,

16:41.830 --> 16:46.028
BELIEVE ME, I WANT TO FIND HIM
MORE THAN ANYONE.

16:46.070 --> 16:47.594
- OH, HELL, NO.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.790
MAN, I AIN'T FEELING HER
AT ALL.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.603
SHE PART OF THE SYSTEM
THAT STOLE MY LIFE.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.609
- OKAY, THANE--THANE,
I CAN PERSONALLY VOUCH

16:54.640 --> 16:55.470
FOR JULIET, HERE,

16:55.510 --> 16:57.171
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT SHE AGREES
WITH ME.

16:57.210 --> 16:59.644
WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME TEAM.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.147
- OH, WELL, THEN YOU AIN'T
ON MY TEAM, THEN.

17:01.180 --> 17:02.215
- WHAT?

17:02.250 --> 17:04.286
- LAST THING WE NEED
IS FOR HER TO PLANT EVIDENCE

17:04.320 --> 17:06.584
TO FRAME SOME OTHER DUDE.

17:06.620 --> 17:08.656
- JULES, WE--WE'VE GOT YOUR BACK
ON THIS.

17:08.690 --> 17:09.657
THIS IS--
THERE'S NOT TWO TEAMS.

17:09.690 --> 17:12.784
- THANE, COME HERE.

17:12.830 --> 17:15.651
WE WORK WITH JULIET
ALL THE TIME.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.167
BESIDES, IT'S THE OTHER ONE
THAT'S MOST LIKELY

17:17.200 --> 17:18.690
TO PLANT THE EVIDENCE.

17:18.730 --> 17:20.698
- EITHER YOU WORK SEPARATE
FROM THE POLICE,

17:20.740 --> 17:22.594
OR YOU DON'T GET
YOUR $10,000.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.562
- [scoffs]
- $10,000?

17:24.610 --> 17:27.101
- I AGREED TO PAY YOU
10% OF MY RESTITUTION

17:27.140 --> 17:29.074
IF YOU HELPED ME GET IT.

17:29.110 --> 17:30.771
YOU DIDN'T GET THE CONTRACT
THAT MANDELBAUM SENT OVER?

17:30.810 --> 17:32.675
- WHAT CONTRACT?

17:32.710 --> 17:34.678
- I THOUGHT THAT--
WELL, IT WAS FULL OF WORDS.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.541
- WELL, YOUR SHARE OF IT
IS $10,000.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.616
- 'SCUSE US ONE SECOND.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.514
- JULES, UH,

17:42.560 --> 17:44.448
DID YOU--DID YOU REALLY MEAN IT
WHEN YOU SAID

17:44.490 --> 17:48.551
YOU WEREN'T GONNA TAKE ME
WORKING WITH THANE PERSONALLY?

17:48.600 --> 17:49.555
- YES.

17:49.600 --> 17:50.669
- GOOD, BECAUSE LIKE YOU SAID,

17:50.700 --> 17:52.167
GUS AND I DO HAVE
A BUSINESS TO RUN.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.532
- AND TEN GRAND
IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

17:54.570 --> 17:55.867
- TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.606
- I KNEW YOU WOULD.
- COOL.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.528
COOL, COOL.

17:59.570 --> 18:03.643
- OKAY, UH--
[smooch]

18:03.680 --> 18:04.772
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU.

18:04.810 --> 18:06.107
AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY
CANCEL DINNER

18:06.150 --> 18:07.742
BECAUSE THAT'LL JUST BE
AWKWARD.

18:07.780 --> 18:10.783
- YEAH.

18:19.230 --> 18:20.652
- OKAY, GREAT, WELL,
THANK YOU FOR CALLING ME BACK.

18:20.700 --> 18:21.689
I APPRECIATE IT.

18:21.730 --> 18:22.697
- WHO WERE YOU TALKING TO?

18:22.730 --> 18:23.719
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, GUS.

18:23.770 --> 18:24.691
JUST AS WE SUSPECT ED,

18:24.730 --> 18:27.528
BOTH THE STOP-N-GULP
AND THE JEWELRY STORE

18:27.570 --> 18:29.765
HIRED THE SAME CONTRACTOR
FOR RECENT RENOVATIONS,

18:29.800 --> 18:31.233
DERRICK POOLE.

18:31.270 --> 18:32.464
- WHICH MEANS
HE WOULD'VE HAD ACCESS

18:32.510 --> 18:34.330
TO THE ALARM WIRES
WHEN THE WALLS WERE OPEN.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.200
- AND IF WE CAN PIN
THIS RESTAURANT ROBBERY

18:36.240 --> 18:37.172
ON THIS POOLE GUY,

18:37.210 --> 18:39.349
THAT MEANS I CAN GET
MY RESTITUTION MONEY.

18:39.380 --> 18:40.813
- WE'RE AWARE OF THIS, THANE.

18:40.850 --> 18:42.317
- SHAWN, ARE YOU SURE
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A PROBLEM

18:42.350 --> 18:43.180
BETWEEN YOU AND JULIET?

18:43.220 --> 18:44.448
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE SEEMED A LITTLE--

18:44.490 --> 18:46.287
- A LITTLE WHAT?
- EHHH.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.617
- OH, SHE'S OKAY, MAN.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.719
I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU
RIGHT NOW.

18:49.760 --> 18:50.920
[dialing]

18:50.960 --> 18:52.427
[line ringing]

18:52.460 --> 18:53.449
HEY, JULES.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.558

18:57.700 --> 19:00.260
WITH THE FACT THAT WE CHOSE

19:00.300 --> 19:01.267
- OH, OF COURSE I AM.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.392
- YOU ARE?

19:02.440 --> 19:03.532

19:03.570 --> 19:04.537
[whispering]
I TOLD YOU.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.770
WHO SAID WE COULDN'T SEPARATE
THE PERSONAL STUFF

19:08.810 --> 19:09.799
FROM THE WORK STUFF?

19:09.840 --> 19:12.775
WE BUILT A WALL
OF SEPARATION.

19:12.810 --> 19:15.711
IT'S MADE OUT OF ADULT
RELATIONSHIP AWESOMENESS.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.945
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
A BUNDT CAKE.

19:17.990 --> 19:18.945
LOVE YOU.

19:18.990 --> 19:21.356

19:25.330 --> 19:26.888

19:29.660 --> 19:30.661
[tires squeal]

19:30.700 --> 19:34.192
JULES!

HEY.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.265
UH, WHAT'S THIS?

19:40.340 --> 19:41.102
USING VIDEO SURVEILLANCE

19:41.140 --> 19:42.778
FROM THE STORE
ACROSS THE STREET.

19:42.810 --> 19:44.243
WE'RE BRINGING HIM IN
FOR QUESTIONING.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.508
SORRY.

19:45.550 --> 19:47.370
- UH, YOU THINK WE COULD TALK
TO HIM FOR A FEW MINUTES FIRST?

19:47.420 --> 19:48.876
IT'D BE VERY HELPFUL
FOR THE THANE CASE.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.649
- OH, NO.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.317
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT
ANY HELP FROM THE POLICE,

19:52.350 --> 19:54.250
SO YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY.

19:54.290 --> 19:55.484

20:01.600 --> 20:03.363

OH, I'M SORRY, SHAWN.

20:03.400 --> 20:06.528
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU.

20:06.570 --> 20:07.969
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.365
- WE JUST GOT BLOCKED.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.368
- OH, NO, Y'ALL JUST GOT

20:11.410 --> 20:15.232
BUT WHO NEEDS THE POLICE
WHEN YOU GOT A PSYCHIC, RIGHT?

20:15.280 --> 20:18.374
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

20:23.450 --> 20:25.839
[muffled voices]

20:25.890 --> 20:26.788
[knock at door]

20:26.820 --> 20:28.856
- OFFICER MCNAB,

20:28.890 --> 20:30.357

20:30.390 --> 20:31.880
HE'S TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS CASE,

20:31.930 --> 20:33.852
PER ORDERS
FROM DETECTIVE O'HARA.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.595
- YOU'RE REALLY ENJOYING THIS,
AREN'T YOU?

20:35.630 --> 20:38.360
- I DO LIKE IT
WHEN YOU GET YOUR COMEUPPANCE.

20:38.400 --> 20:42.359

20:42.400 --> 20:43.469

20:43.510 --> 20:44.306

20:44.340 --> 20:45.602
YOU KNOW I ONLY WANT
TO ASK THIS DUDE

20:45.640 --> 20:46.607
A COUPLE QUESTIONS.

20:46.640 --> 20:47.971
- I'M SORRY, SHAWN,

20:48.010 --> 20:50.774
BUT I HAVE MY ORDERS.

20:50.810 --> 20:52.004
- ALL RIGHT,
BUT IF I CAN'T TALK TO HIM,

20:52.050 --> 20:53.608
I'M GONNA TALK
TO HIS WORKERS.

20:53.650 --> 20:54.617
- UH, THAT MAY BE
KIND OF HARD.

20:54.650 --> 20:55.776
HE ONLY USES DAY LABORERS.

20:55.820 --> 20:56.616
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

20:56.650 --> 20:58.311
- I RESPONDED
TO UNION COMPLAINTS

20:58.350 --> 21:02.958
ABOUT POOLE USING THEM
ON UNION JOBS.

21:02.990 --> 21:05.686
- ANY CHANCE OF YOU KEEPING
THAT VERY VALUABLE INFORMATION

21:05.730 --> 21:08.255
AWAY FROM LASSITER
AND JULIET?

21:11.800 --> 21:13.597
- OF COURSE NOT.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.632
- WELL, THEN, THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING FOR ME TO DO.

21:21.940 --> 21:24.079
- GOING UNDERCOVER
AS DAY LABORERS?

21:24.110 --> 21:26.647
WORST IDEA EVER.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.011
- DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY
TERRIBLE IDEAS

21:28.050 --> 21:29.574
YOU'RE NOT ACCOUNTING FOR
BY SAYING THAT?

21:29.620 --> 21:31.485
THIS IS WHERE POOLE HIRES
HIS GUYS, MAN.

21:31.520 --> 21:32.509
JUST TRY TO FIT IN.

21:32.550 --> 21:33.983
- DON'T WORRY.
I HAVE A HAMMER.

21:34.020 --> 21:36.352
[hawks and spits]

21:36.390 --> 21:37.982

21:39.560 --> 21:41.096
HAMMERIN' GUS.

21:41.130 --> 21:42.597
- HE'S DISGUSTING.

21:42.630 --> 21:43.699
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

21:43.730 --> 21:45.994
- HE'S BEEN THROUGH
A LOT, SHAWN.

21:46.030 --> 21:48.032
- HEY, MAN.

21:48.070 --> 21:50.868
YOU, UH, YOU HAPPEN TO DO

21:50.910 --> 21:52.559

TO GET IN WITH SENOR POOLE,

22:01.980 --> 22:04.119
YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK.

22:04.150 --> 22:06.380
HE'S WHAT WE CALL
MUY DELICADO.

22:06.420 --> 22:07.887
- HE'S A DELI FOR COWS?

22:07.920 --> 22:09.558
- IT MEANS HE'S PICKY, SHAWN.

22:09.590 --> 22:10.921
- YOU HAVE TO KNOW DRYWALL,

22:10.960 --> 22:13.428
ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING.

22:13.460 --> 22:15.894

IT WAS COMPLETELY FULL.

22:24.270 --> 22:26.568

ON THAT STOP-N-GULP JOB.

22:26.610 --> 22:27.599

22:30.650 --> 22:32.948
YOU KNOW ANYBODY

22:32.980 --> 22:34.641
- THERE WAS ONLY ONE GUY.

22:34.680 --> 22:37.012
CARL.

22:37.050 --> 22:38.881
- UH, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE WE CAN FIND CARL?

22:38.920 --> 22:42.048
- WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

22:42.090 --> 22:43.557

MR. BENJAMIN.

22:43.590 --> 22:47.390

22:55.840 --> 22:59.401
[tires squeal]

22:59.440 --> 23:00.839
- HOLA, I NEED THREE AMIGOS.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.939
MUCHO FORTE.

23:06.610 --> 23:08.043
I KNEW YOU WERE LYING
WHEN YOU SAID

23:08.080 --> 23:09.945
YOU BUILT THAT DECK
ALL BY YOURSELF.

23:09.980 --> 23:13.108
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

23:13.150 --> 23:15.152
[tires squeal]

23:18.190 --> 23:19.680

23:19.730 --> 23:21.618
I GUESS WE'RE GOING

23:21.660 --> 23:23.867
- * BOOM, BOOM

23:28.170 --> 23:29.569
- THANKS FOR LETTING ME
TAG ALONG, FELLAS.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.033
- YOU WERE HIDING
IN THE BACKSEAT.

23:31.070 --> 23:32.662
- WELL, THANKS FOR LEAVING
YOUR EXTRA SET OF CAR KEYS

23:32.710 --> 23:34.530
IN PLAIN SIGHT IN THE BACK
OF YOUR DESK DRAWER.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.878
- LOOK, THANE, WE--
JUST PLAY IT COOL, ALL RIGHT?

23:36.910 --> 23:38.468
WE THINK THIS CARL GUY
MAY BE RESPONSIBLE

23:38.510 --> 23:39.374
FOR THE LAST TWO ROBBERIES,

23:39.410 --> 23:41.219
PLUS THE ONE
THAT YOU WERE BLAMED FOR.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.138
- CAN I HELP YOU?

23:43.180 --> 23:44.647
- UH, MAYBE.

23:44.690 --> 23:47.181
UH, WE'RE LOOKING FOR, UH,
A DUDE NAMED CARL,

23:47.220 --> 23:48.881
SUPPOSED TO LIVE
ON THIS BLOCK.

23:48.920 --> 23:49.887
- CARL'S MY SON.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.854
- OH.
- OH.

23:51.890 --> 23:55.053
- WELL, UH, IN THAT CASE,
MR., UH--

23:55.100 --> 23:56.852
- DOZIER.

23:56.900 --> 23:58.162
FRED DOZIER.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.758
- I GOT IT.
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.665
MR. DOZIER,

24:01.700 --> 24:03.509
WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR SON
BECAUSE WE WANT TO, UH,

24:03.540 --> 24:05.064
TALK TO HIM ABOUT, UM,

24:05.110 --> 24:06.168
UH, UH--

24:06.210 --> 24:08.098
- ABOUT AN OPPORTUNITY, SIR.

24:08.140 --> 24:11.803
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO--
TO, UH--

24:11.850 --> 24:13.647
- UH, AN OPPORTUNITY
TO, UH,

24:13.680 --> 24:15.671
- MR. DOZIER,
WE NEED YOUR HELP

24:15.720 --> 24:18.848
PROVING YOUR SON
IS A NO-GOOD CRIMINAL.

24:18.890 --> 24:21.211
- SMOOTH, REAL SMOOTH.
- THANK YOU.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.989
- COME ON IN.

24:23.020 --> 24:26.080
- THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

24:29.260 --> 24:31.990
- CARL IS MY ONLY CHILD.

24:32.030 --> 24:35.568
THAT KNUCKLEHEAD HAS NEVER
LIVED UP TO HIS POTENTIAL.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.899
NOW, WHAT'D HE DO THIS TIME?

24:38.940 --> 24:41.602
- WELL, UH,
WE WERE KIND OF HOPING

24:41.640 --> 24:42.868
YOU COULD HELP US
FIGURE THAT OUT.

24:42.910 --> 24:44.207
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

24:44.250 --> 24:46.206
- I DONI'T KNOW.

24:46.250 --> 24:47.649
I TOLD HIM
I COULDN'T CARRY HIM ANYMORE,

24:47.680 --> 24:49.648
SO I KICKED HIM OUT
ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.012
- THAT'S RIGHT BEFORE
THE STOP-N-GULP ROBBERY.

24:52.050 --> 24:53.039
- MM-HMM.

24:53.090 --> 24:54.011
- MR. DOZIER,

24:54.060 --> 24:59.123
DO YOU HAVE ANY RECENT PICTURES
OF YOUR SON?

24:59.160 --> 25:00.252
- I HAVE THIS ONE.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.222
- OH, THAT'S NICE.

25:01.260 --> 25:04.058
UH, MIND IF WE, UH,
HELD ONTO THAT FOR A--

25:04.100 --> 25:07.297
- I'D LIKE TO KEEP IT,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

25:07.330 --> 25:10.606
- I UNDERSTAND.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.631
- THAT DON'T LOOK
NOTHING LIKE ME.

25:12.670 --> 25:15.730
- WELL, I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
LOOKING IN A MIRROR, NO.

25:15.780 --> 25:17.031
- NO, NO, NO.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.604
I GOT WAVES IN MY HEAD.
HIS HAIR NAPPY.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.277
ALL RIGHT?

25:20.310 --> 25:21.811
I GOT ONE CHIN.
HE GOT THREE.

25:21.850 --> 25:22.817
LOOK, I GOT A BIG HEAD,

25:22.850 --> 25:24.010
BUT LOOK HOW BIG
HIS HEAD IS.

25:24.050 --> 25:26.814
- HE KINDA LOOKS LIKE THE GUY
FROM THE BLIND SIDE.

25:26.850 --> 25:29.182
- IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU GUYS CAN DO

25:29.220 --> 25:30.949
TO HELP HIM OUT,

25:30.990 --> 25:32.082
I'D--I'D APPRECIATE IT.

25:32.130 --> 25:35.622
HE'S A GOOD KID AT HEART.

25:35.660 --> 25:39.061
AND I'D DO ANYTHING
TO KEEP HIM OUT OF JAIL.

25:39.100 --> 25:40.988
- I'VE HAD A VISION.

25:41.040 --> 25:44.066
I KNOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE RESTAURANT ROBBERY

25:44.110 --> 25:46.169
THAT THANE WOODSON
WAS FRAMED FOR.

25:46.210 --> 25:48.303
IT IS THIS MAN.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.069
AND HIS NAME'S--
- CARL DOZIER.

25:50.110 --> 25:51.646
- HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

25:51.680 --> 25:53.204
- O'HARA FIGURED IT OUT.

25:53.250 --> 25:55.343
SHE'S BEEN BURNING
THE MIDNIGHT OIL.

25:55.380 --> 25:56.347
- I WAS ALREADY LOOKING
INTO SOME

25:56.380 --> 25:57.984
OF DERRICK POOLE'S WORKERS,

25:58.020 --> 26:00.045
AND I HAD NARROWED IT DOWN
TO CARL AND A FEW OTHERS.

26:00.090 --> 26:01.819
THERE WAS ALSO A TINY DROPLET
OF BLOOD FOUND

26:01.860 --> 26:03.828
ON A PIECE OF CLOTHING STUCK
IN THE BARBED-WIRE FENCE

26:03.860 --> 26:05.157
SURROUNDING THE JEWELRY STORE.

26:05.190 --> 26:07.351
OH, WAIT, I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
TALKING TO YOU.

26:07.390 --> 26:08.789
- ONCE YOU RUN
A FULL DNA ANALYSIS

26:08.830 --> 26:10.127
OF THE BLOOD,

26:10.160 --> 26:13.368
WE'LL HAVE SCIENTIFIC PROOF
WHO THE BURGLAR IS.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.867
- I HAVE A GREAT IDEA.

26:14.900 --> 26:18.233
- HMM?
- JULES...

26:18.270 --> 26:20.773
LET'S WORK TOGETHER
ON THIS THING.

26:20.810 --> 26:22.107
FOR THANE.

26:22.140 --> 26:23.869
IT'LL BE JUST LIKE
THE OLD DAYS.

26:23.910 --> 26:25.002
THE SWEET DAYS.

26:25.050 --> 26:28.076
- WHAT ABOUT THE WALL
SEPARATING WORK AND PERSONAL?

26:28.120 --> 26:30.111
- OH, IT'S STILL THERE.
ROCK SOLID.

26:30.150 --> 26:33.210
WE'RE JUST GONNA PUT IN
A LITTLE BABY WINDOW.

26:33.250 --> 26:35.115
- HMM. NICE TRY.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.685
- TCH.

26:37.730 --> 26:38.879
MAN.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.955
- OH, DON'T FORGET TO TIVO
THE VOICE.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.251
- YEAH, I GOT IT.

26:42.300 --> 26:44.222
[fast footsteps approach]

26:44.270 --> 26:46.864
- DUDE, SERIOUSLY,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

26:46.900 --> 26:48.197
- MAN, YOU KNOW I HAD TO FINISH
MY ROUTE.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.094
- YOU STILL HAVE THAT JOB?

26:50.140 --> 26:52.062
LOOK, JULES IS VERY CLOSE
TO SOLVING THIS CASE.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.099
- IF SHE DOES THAT,

26:53.140 --> 26:54.232
THAT MEANS WE WON'T GET
OUR MONEY.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.929
- WE NEED TO GET
THAT RESTAURANT OWNER

26:55.980 --> 26:59.279
TO COME IN AND LOOK
AT THE NEW LINEUP.

27:03.020 --> 27:04.908
HEY, MERCER!

27:04.950 --> 27:06.884
- MERCER!

27:06.920 --> 27:08.649
- COME ON, MAN.

27:08.690 --> 27:10.658
MERCER, WE HAVE
A FEW MORE QUESTIONS

27:10.690 --> 27:12.658
ABOUT THANE'S CASE.

27:12.690 --> 27:15.659
[ominous music]

27:15.700 --> 27:23.709
*

27:34.820 --> 27:37.243
[grunts]

27:37.280 --> 27:38.918
[crunch!]

27:47.260 --> 27:50.252
- THIS IS THE SECURITY CAMERA
FOOTAGE FROM THE DVR.

27:56.170 --> 27:59.207
- NO WAY.

28:07.410 --> 28:12.109
- NO, THANE.
NO.

28:12.150 --> 28:15.358
- WELL, MAYBE THIS IS HIS WAY
OF SAYING THANK YOU

28:15.390 --> 28:17.187
FOR TRYING TO CLEAR
HIS GOOD NAME.

28:17.220 --> 28:20.280
- LET'S BRING HIM IN.

28:28.070 --> 28:29.833
- MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M BACK IN JAIL.

28:29.870 --> 28:32.964
THE DAYS ARE ALREADY BEGINNING
TO BLUR TOGETHER.

28:33.010 --> 28:34.375
- YOU'VE BEEN IN HERE
FOR THREE HOURS.

28:34.410 --> 28:36.298
- OH!

28:36.340 --> 28:37.204
EXCELLENT TIMING, FELLAS.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.276
I JUST FINISHED PROCESSING
YOUR CLIENT,

28:39.310 --> 28:41.813
WHO I ALWAYS THOUGHT WAS GUILTY,
BY THE WAY,

28:41.850 --> 28:42.817
ON MURDER CHARGES.

28:42.850 --> 28:44.408
- HEY, BUT LOOK, MAN,
YOU GOT THAT ALL WRONG.

28:44.450 --> 28:46.418
I WENT DOWN THERE
TO ASK MERCER FOR MY JOB BACK

28:46.450 --> 28:48.350
BECAUSE HE SAID I WAS
THE BEST COOK HE EVER HAD.

28:48.390 --> 28:50.255
AND THEN I FOUND
THE DEAD BODY,

28:50.290 --> 28:51.450
AND A BROTHER JUST PANICKED.

28:51.490 --> 28:53.355
I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE DEJA VU.

28:53.390 --> 28:55.449
- MAN, THANE, IF YOU HAD SEEN
THE VIDEO THAT WE SAW,

28:55.500 --> 28:58.321
YOU'D HAVE BEEN LIKE,
"DAMN, THAT DUDE IS GUILTY."

28:58.370 --> 28:59.325
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

28:59.370 --> 29:00.428
- WHAT?

29:00.470 --> 29:02.267
MAN, YOU GUYS SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE ME.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.359
- AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO NOT GET
ARRESTED FOR KILLING SOMEONE.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.968
- TALKING ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE
ARE SUPPOSED TO DO,

29:06.010 --> 29:07.204
WHAT THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO DO.

29:07.240 --> 29:10.778
- HE HAS A VERY GOOD POINT.

29:10.810 --> 29:11.777
- YOU'RE KILLING ME, THANE.

29:11.810 --> 29:13.539
- HEY--
- YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

29:13.580 --> 29:16.378
- WHAT?

29:16.420 --> 29:17.887
- MAN, WE NEVER DOUBTED YOU.

29:17.920 --> 29:19.319
MY MAN.

29:19.350 --> 29:21.079
- MY MAN.
- NO.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.451
THANKS, JERRY.

29:22.490 --> 29:25.357
IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT SOMEBODY
STILL BELIEVES IN ME.

29:25.390 --> 29:26.982
UH, NOTE, WE GONNA SUE
THE STATE

29:27.030 --> 29:28.497
FOR THESE LAST THREE HOURS
AS WELL.

29:28.530 --> 29:29.792
- THAT MEANS OUR CUT'S
THREE BUCKS.

29:29.830 --> 29:30.649
NICE.

29:30.700 --> 29:31.621
- NOT GONNA--
NOT GONNA SUE THE STATE.

29:31.670 --> 29:33.467
ACTUALLY, THE PERSON
YOU SHOULD BE THANKING

29:33.500 --> 29:34.296
IS DETECTIVE O'HARA.

29:34.340 --> 29:34.965
SHE'S THE ONE
THAT FOUND EVIDENCE

29:35.000 --> 29:36.331
ABSOLVING YOU OF THIS MURDER

29:36.370 --> 29:37.439
AND HAD THE CHARGES DROPPED.

29:37.470 --> 29:38.539
- O'HARA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

29:38.570 --> 29:41.437
- I CANVASSED THE AREA
FOR WITNESSES A SECOND TIME,

29:41.480 --> 29:42.538
AND I FOUND SOMEONE
WHO WILL TESTIFY

29:42.580 --> 29:45.378
THAT THEY SAW SOMEBODY ELSE
LEAVING THE RESTAURANT

29:45.410 --> 29:47.378
AN HOUR BEFORE THANE GOT THERE,
WHICH IS RIGHT IN LINE

29:47.410 --> 29:50.379
WITH THE CORONER'S ESTIMATED
TIME OF DEATH.

29:50.420 --> 29:52.285
- HOW MANY GET OUT OF JAIL FREE
CARDS DOES A GUY GET?

29:52.320 --> 29:53.514
- TWO, DUH.

29:53.550 --> 29:56.815
ONE IN CHANCE,
ONE IN COMMUNITY CHEST.

29:56.860 --> 29:58.452
- CARL UNDOUBTEDLY KNEW
THAT WE WERE ON TO HIM

29:58.490 --> 30:00.583
AND THAT WE WERE TALKING
TO MERCER LAWRENCE,

30:00.630 --> 30:02.894
SO HE KILLED MERCER
TO COVER HIS TRACKS.

30:02.930 --> 30:04.864
- AND DETECTIVE O'HARA
ALSO FOUND DNA EVIDENCE

30:04.900 --> 30:06.265
WHICH WE HOPE WILL LEAD US
TO IDENTIFYING

30:06.300 --> 30:07.221
THE CULPRIT
IN ALL THESE CRIMES

30:07.270 --> 30:11.263
AND GET YOU YOUR RESTITUTION
FROM THE STATE.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.459
- POLICE LADY,

30:12.510 --> 30:14.000
YOU DONE RIGHT BY ME.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.075
- WELL, I WAS HORRIFIED
AT THE THOUGHT

30:15.110 --> 30:16.304
OF MAKING
THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE.

30:16.340 --> 30:17.944
- OH, I SHOULD'VE LET YOU
HELP A BROTHER OUT

30:17.980 --> 30:18.969
WHEN YOU OFFERED.

30:19.010 --> 30:20.079
I MISJUDGED YOU.

30:20.110 --> 30:21.247
COME ON, RIGHT HERE.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.542
- OH, YEAH, OKAY.
OH, WE'RE HUGGING.

30:22.580 --> 30:24.411
- THERE YOU GO.
- THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

30:24.450 --> 30:25.439
- AWWW.
- IT'S LOVE.

30:25.490 --> 30:28.118
- ALL RIGHT.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.411
- IT'S HIS THING.
- YEAH.

30:29.460 --> 30:30.358
- Y'ALL FIRED.

30:30.390 --> 30:32.324
- WHAT?
- OH, HELL, NAW!

30:32.360 --> 30:33.520
NO, THANE, COME ON!

30:33.560 --> 30:35.027
- YOU'RE NOT STILL UPSET
ABOUT THE WHOLE

30:35.060 --> 30:36.925
WE-THINK-YOU'RE-GUILTY THING,
ARE YOU?

30:36.960 --> 30:37.927
- WOW.

30:37.970 --> 30:39.619
GUYS, THAT MUST REALLY HURT.

30:39.670 --> 30:43.197
WELL, AT LEAST SOMETHING GOOD
CAME OUT OF THIS.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.500
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

30:50.540 --> 30:51.871
FIRST I MADE JULES MAD.

30:51.910 --> 30:53.468
THEN I MADE THANE LOSE FAITH,

30:53.510 --> 30:54.545
WHICH COST US OUR FEE,

30:54.580 --> 30:55.911
WHICH MADE GUS CRY,

30:55.950 --> 30:58.145
WHICH IS NOT THAT
OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.282
- YEAH, ONCE AGAIN,
YOU FIND YOURSELF

30:59.320 --> 31:00.412
STUCK IN THE MIDDLE, SHAWN,

31:00.450 --> 31:01.417
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO TAKE A SIDE.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.018
BUT ONCE YOU DO,
REMEMBER THIS:

31:03.060 --> 31:06.223
LOVE LASTS.
MONEY DOESN'T.

31:06.260 --> 31:07.522
OH, COME ON, MAN.

31:07.560 --> 31:09.152
GO SUCK UP TO JULIET.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.259
YOU MAY NEVER FIND A GAL
THIS GOOD AGAIN.

31:11.300 --> 31:12.369
- I KNOW.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.459
BUT IT WAS TEN GS.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.434
- HUH?
- $10,000.

31:16.470 --> 31:17.596
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

31:17.640 --> 31:19.369
- TAX-FREE, I THINK.

31:19.410 --> 31:20.468
- OKAY, SCRATCH WHAT
I JUST SAID.

31:20.510 --> 31:21.204
GO BUY JULIET A BROOCH.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.605
- BROOCH?
- TENNIS BRACELET.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.505
UH, A CORSAGE, WHAT--

31:24.550 --> 31:26.905
GET OFF THE COUCH.
GO MAKE UP WITH THANE.

31:26.950 --> 31:28.508
- YOU JUST SAID LOVE LASTS.

31:28.550 --> 31:30.415
- WELL, IT LASTS A LOT LONGER
WHEN YOU GOT MONEY IN THE BANK.

31:30.450 --> 31:32.509
TRUST ME.

31:35.990 --> 31:37.412
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
LET ME HANDLE THIS, OKAY?

31:37.460 --> 31:39.325
I'M GONNA SWEET-TALK HIM
INTO HIRING US BACK,

31:39.360 --> 31:41.225
AND I'M GONNA DO IT
SOUTHERN STYLE.

31:41.260 --> 31:42.955
- PLEASE TELL THE LAB
WE REALLY NEED THE DNA RESULTS

31:43.000 --> 31:45.491
ON THAT DROPLET OF BLOOD
FROM THE CRIME SCENE.

31:45.530 --> 31:46.997
UH-HUH.
ALL RIGHT.

31:47.030 --> 31:49.169
- [clears throat]
- I'LL HOLD.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.360
- [Southern accent]
HEY, THANE.

31:50.400 --> 31:51.537
[chuckles]

31:51.570 --> 31:52.559
OH, COME ON, NOW, THANE.

31:52.610 --> 31:54.578
DON'T Y'ALL BE LIKE THAT.

31:54.610 --> 31:56.100
Y'ALL KNOW ME AND GUS
IS STILL ON YOUR SIDE.

31:56.140 --> 31:57.471
WE NEVER LEFT YOU.

31:57.510 --> 31:58.704
- Y'ALL ARE AN IDIOT.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.149
- SHHH.

32:00.180 --> 32:02.216
- THAT WHAT I SOUND LIKE
TO YOU?

32:02.250 --> 32:04.138
UNCLE REMUS?
HMM?

32:04.190 --> 32:06.442
WELL, Y'ALLS CAN KEEP
Y'ALL'S APOLOGY.

32:06.490 --> 32:08.287
- GREAT, NOW YOU'VE OFFENDED
THE MAN.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.582
- THERE'S A BACKUP
AT THE LAB.

32:09.620 --> 32:11.679
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO GET
THE DNA RESULTS FOR A BIT.

32:11.730 --> 32:12.981
- DAMN.

32:13.030 --> 32:14.190
- THAT MEANS WE STILL HAVE
SOME TIME.

32:14.230 --> 32:16.289
- NO WORRIES, WE'LL JUST KEEP
MOVING THINGS ON OUR END.

32:16.330 --> 32:17.399
MY GUT TELLS ME THAT CARL'S
GONNA HAVE TO GET RID

32:17.430 --> 32:18.522
OF THESE DIAMONDS
IN A HURRY.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.219
BASED ON THE STORE'S INVENTORY,

32:20.270 --> 32:21.464
I'D SAY THEY'RE GONNA MOVE
PRETTY QUICK.

32:21.500 --> 32:24.469
THEY'RE ALL MID-QUALITY,
"I" COLOR, S.I. CLARITY.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.102
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANY
OF THIS DIAMOND TALK MEANS,

32:26.140 --> 32:28.028
BUT IT'S A LITTLE SCARY
THAT SHE DOES.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.729
- S.I. MEANS THE DIAMOND HAS
SLIGHT INCLUSIONS,

32:29.780 --> 32:32.442
OR FLAWS,
ON THE INSIDE.

32:35.250 --> 32:37.514
- OOH, I'M--
I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

32:37.550 --> 32:40.417
THESE DIAMONDS
ARE FULL OF LOVE.

32:40.450 --> 32:43.055
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY BEEF
WITH ANYBODY.

32:43.090 --> 32:45.479
THEY'RE CONFLICT -FREE.

32:45.530 --> 32:47.122
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

32:47.160 --> 32:49.094
- THAT MEANS THEY DON'T COME
FROM ANY WAR-TORN REGIONS.

32:49.130 --> 32:50.722
AND EVERY CONFLICT-FREE DIAMOND
HAS A UNIQUE,

32:50.760 --> 32:51.761
LASER-ETCHED I.D. ON IT.

32:51.800 --> 32:54.564
- WHICH MEANS THAT IF WE CAN
FIND THE DIAMONDS,

32:54.600 --> 32:57.364
WE CAN THEN TRACE THEM
BACK TO CARL.

32:57.400 --> 33:00.130
- THAT'S A GOOD LEAD.

33:00.170 --> 33:01.330
- HANDLE IT.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.735
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL NOTIFY
ALL LOCAL PAWN SHOPS

33:03.780 --> 33:06.078
AND DIAMOND BROKERS
ABOUT WHICH UNIQUE I.D.s

33:06.110 --> 33:07.077
TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.316
HOPEFULLY, WE'LL GET A HIT.

33:08.350 --> 33:10.409
THEN WE CAN TRACK RECORDS
FROM THE PAWN SHOP

33:10.450 --> 33:13.044
TO GET AN ADDRESS
FOR THE PERSON WHO FENCED IT.

33:13.090 --> 33:14.318
- GOOD WORK, SHAWN.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.009
- THANK YOU, JULES.

33:16.060 --> 33:18.324
I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR
THAT WE WORK BETTER TOGETHER.

33:18.360 --> 33:19.452
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE MAKE A TRUCE?

33:19.490 --> 33:20.388
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR MONEY?

33:20.430 --> 33:22.250
- WE'VE GOT TO GET
OUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT.

33:22.300 --> 33:23.324
THIS WAS NEVER
ABOUT THE MONEY.

33:23.360 --> 33:26.397
OW.

33:26.430 --> 33:29.433
- WELL, I MUST ADMIT, SHAWN,

33:29.470 --> 33:31.461
YOU SHOWED UP AND SHOWED OUT
ON THAT ONE.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.636
- THAT IS BECAUSE
WE ARE STILL COMMITTED

33:32.670 --> 33:33.807
TO YOUR CASE, THAN E,

33:33.840 --> 33:36.206
AND WE ARE COMMITTED
TO YOU, MAN.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.140
- HOPEFULLY, THIS MAKES UP
FOR US DOUBTING YOU EARLIER.

33:38.180 --> 33:39.602
- AND IF IT DOES,
MAYBE, YOU KNOW,

33:39.650 --> 33:43.711
YOU'LL HIRE US BACK
OR SOMETHING.

33:43.750 --> 33:47.516
- Y'ALL AIN'T SAID NOTHING
BUT A WORD.

33:47.550 --> 33:49.051
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

33:49.090 --> 33:50.409
COME OVER HERE.
ALL RIGHT.

33:50.460 --> 33:52.451
WE BACK IN THE SADDLE AGAIN.

33:52.490 --> 33:53.479
- DOES THAT MEAN
HE HIRED US BACK?

33:53.530 --> 33:55.418
- I DON'T KNOW.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.204
- JASMINE RICHARDS?

34:05.240 --> 34:06.559
- YES.

34:06.610 --> 34:07.668
- I'M DETECTIVE O'HARA.

34:07.710 --> 34:09.337
WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS

34:09.380 --> 34:11.143
ABOUT THE DIAMONDS THAT YOU
PAWNED AT E Z PAWN AND TITLE.

34:11.180 --> 34:15.276
MAY WE PLEASE COME IN?

34:15.320 --> 34:17.140
- THANK YOU.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.078
BEFORE WE BEGIN,
MS. RICHARDS,

34:18.120 --> 34:19.439
IS ANYONE ELSE
IN THE APARTMENT WITH YOU?

34:19.490 --> 34:21.117
- I LIVE ALONE.

34:21.160 --> 34:21.910
AS FAR AS THE DIAMONDS GO,

34:21.960 --> 34:24.224
THEY WERE A GIFT
FROM MY LOUSY EX.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.421
- CARL DOZIER?

34:26.460 --> 34:27.688
- HE BROUGHT THEM BY
TRYING TO WIN ME BACK,

34:27.730 --> 34:30.426
BUT I SAID, "HELL, NO,"
AND I THREW HIM OUT.

34:30.460 --> 34:31.666
- BUT YOU KEPT THE DIAMONDS.

34:31.700 --> 34:34.430
- THEY'RE NOT THE ONES WHO SLEPT
WITH MY SISTER.

34:34.470 --> 34:36.631
- AND YOU SAY
THAT YOU KICKED HIM OUT?

34:36.670 --> 34:39.537
- I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE.

34:39.570 --> 34:42.471
- OKAY, WELL, LISTEN,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

34:42.510 --> 34:44.444
IF CARL COMES BACK,
COULD YOU GIVE US A CALL?

34:44.480 --> 34:47.278
I'M GONNA WRITE
MY NUMBER D--

34:47.310 --> 34:48.447
I MISPLACED MY PEN.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.845
DO YOU HAVE ONE
THAT I COULD BORROW?

34:49.880 --> 34:51.518
- I THINK SO.
- SUPER-DUPER.

34:51.550 --> 34:53.313
I'M JUST GONNA WRITE MY DIRECT
LINE ON THE BACK OF THIS.

34:53.350 --> 34:58.219
YOU CAN CALL ME ANYTIME, 24/7,
IN CASE CARL SHOWS UP.

35:10.370 --> 35:13.362
- STOP RIGHT THERE!

35:13.410 --> 35:15.173
CARL DOZIER,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

35:15.210 --> 35:17.201
- [sighs]

35:20.480 --> 35:25.281
[phone ringing]

35:25.320 --> 35:26.742
- HEY, JULES.
WHAT'S UP?

35:26.790 --> 35:27.745
- HEY, SHAWN.

35:27.790 --> 35:29.519
GREAT NEWS.
WE GOT CARL.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.687
YEAH, HE'S BEEN A SLIPPERY ONE,
BUT WE FINALLY GOT HIM.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.288
I'LL FILL YOU IN
AS SOON AS WE GET--

35:33.330 --> 35:34.592
[screams]

35:34.630 --> 35:36.757
[tires squealing]

35:40.570 --> 35:41.730
OH.

35:41.770 --> 35:43.590
UGH.
[car door opens]

35:43.640 --> 35:44.607
- HEY.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.528
- HEY!
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

35:46.570 --> 35:48.606
NO, CARL!

35:48.640 --> 35:51.302
[tires squealing]

35:58.790 --> 36:00.485
- OW.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.579
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I LET CARL GET AWAY.

36:02.620 --> 36:03.951
- JULES!

36:03.990 --> 36:05.355
HEY, HEY, HEY.
- HEY.

36:05.390 --> 36:06.584
- I CAME AS SOON AS I HEARD.
ARE YOU OKAY?

36:06.630 --> 36:07.619
- I'M OKAY.
- OH.

36:07.660 --> 36:09.321
- I'M OKAY.
- FINGERS?

36:09.360 --> 36:10.588
- I'M OKAY, TOO, SPENCER.

36:10.630 --> 36:11.927
THANKS FOR ASKING.

36:11.970 --> 36:13.790
- HEY, DID YOU GUYS HEAR THAT?

36:13.830 --> 36:16.594
IT'S ALMOST AS IF
LASSIE'S GHOST

36:16.640 --> 36:17.664
THINKS HE'S SITTING HERE
AMONG US,

36:17.700 --> 36:19.804
DOESN'T REALIZE THAT HE PERISHED
IN THAT CAR CRASH.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.376
- WOW.

36:21.410 --> 36:22.672
HIS SPIRIT WON'T BE AT REST
UNTIL WE HELP HIM

36:22.710 --> 36:23.836
TIE UP A LOOSE END.

36:23.880 --> 36:26.371
- THAT'S NOT FUNNY, GUYS.
SERIOUSLY.

36:26.410 --> 36:27.399
- SHAWN, I'M--
- YEAH?

36:27.450 --> 36:30.419
- I'M OKAY.
- OKAY.

36:30.450 --> 36:31.849
- WELL, HERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.619
THE DNA FOUND AT THE JEWELRY
STORE IS A MATCH

36:33.650 --> 36:35.515
TO BLOOD DROPLETS FOUND
IN THE BACK OF O'HARA'S CAR.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.983
- WHICH MEANS
THAT IT HAS TO BE CARL'S.

36:38.020 --> 36:39.578
- HENRY'S CHECKING TO SEE
IF THERE'S A MATCH ON C.O.D.I.S.

36:39.630 --> 36:40.688
- SUPERMAN'S HOME PLANET?

36:40.730 --> 36:42.618
- MAN, YOU KNOW THAT'S KRYPTON.

36:42.660 --> 36:43.319
- IT'S THE NATIONAL DNA
DATABASE.

36:43.360 --> 36:44.668
- GUYS, GUYS, WE GOT A MATCH.

36:44.700 --> 36:45.894
BUT GET THIS.

36:45.930 --> 36:48.364
IT'S TIED TO A CRIME
COMMITTED IN 1981.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.436
- 1981?
CARL WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD.

36:50.470 --> 36:52.461
- THAT MEANS CARL IS JUST LIKE
BENJAMIN BUTTON.

36:52.510 --> 36:55.434
- WHAT? THAT MAKES NO SENSE
AT ALL, SHAWN.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.505
- IT MOST LIKELY BELONGS
TO AN IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER.

36:57.540 --> 37:00.646
THERE'S A 99% CERTAINTY
THAT IT'S A FAMILIAL MATCH.

37:00.680 --> 37:02.614
- CARL'S MY ONLY CHILD.

37:02.650 --> 37:06.689
THAT KNUCKLEHEAD HAS NEVER
LIVED UP TO HIS POTENTIAL.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.381
- WHOA.

37:08.420 --> 37:09.785
I'M--I'M SENSING THAT
EVEN THOUGH CARL'S THE ONE

37:09.820 --> 37:10.809
COMMITTING THE CRIMES,

37:10.860 --> 37:12.282
IT'S HIS FATHER,
FRED DOZIER,

37:12.330 --> 37:13.422
THAT'S BEEN KEEPING US
FROM FINDING HIM.

37:13.460 --> 37:15.496
- WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
THEY DIDN'T SEEM CLOSE AT ALL.

37:15.530 --> 37:16.497
- NO, THEY'RE NOT,

37:16.530 --> 37:18.566
BUT HE'S BEEN COVERING FOR CARL
THIS WHOLE TIME

37:18.600 --> 37:21.637
IN ORDER TO KEEP HIM OUT
OF THE NATIONAL DNA DATABASE.

37:21.670 --> 37:23.399
- BECAUSE FRED KNEW THAT IF CARL
WAS EVER CONVICTED,

37:23.440 --> 37:26.603
CARL WOULD HAVE TO SUBMIT
A MANDATORY DNA SAMPLE.

37:26.640 --> 37:28.403
- AND THAT SAMPLE WOULD BE
A FAMILIAL MATCH

37:28.440 --> 37:29.873
TO DNA EVIDENCE
THAT FRED MUST'VE LEFT

37:29.910 --> 37:32.708
AT A MURDER SCENE
30 YEARS AGO.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.617
OOH, I SHOULD PROBABLY
SEE A DOCTOR.

37:35.650 --> 37:37.845
- MR. DOZIER,
WE NEED YOUR HELP

37:37.880 --> 37:39.814
TO PROVE THAT YOUR SON
IS A NO-GOOD CRIMINAL.

37:39.850 --> 37:41.511
- COME ON IN.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.414
- FRED WAS COOPERATIVE
WITH US

37:43.460 --> 37:44.859
SO AS NOT TO RAISE
OUR SUSPICIONS.

37:44.890 --> 37:46.448
BUT HE MUST'VE FOUND OUT

37:46.490 --> 37:47.787
MERCER LAWRENCE WAS ASSISTING
THE POLICE

37:47.830 --> 37:49.024
WITH A NEW INVESTIGATION.

37:49.060 --> 37:51.494
SO HE SILENCED THAT CHEF
FOR GOOD.

37:51.530 --> 37:55.534
- AGH!

37:55.570 --> 37:57.936
- HERE'S THE CASE FILE
FROM 1981.

37:57.970 --> 38:01.508
SAYS THAT THE VICTIM WAS A WOMAN
IN HER EARLY 20$.

38:01.540 --> 38:02.973
SHE WAS FOUND AT THE DOCKS.

38:03.010 --> 38:04.671
THERE WAS NO OTHER
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.

38:13.690 --> 38:14.679
BACK IN THE DAY.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.483
- WHICH IS AT THE DOCKS.

38:16.520 --> 38:18.385
- WELL, LET'S START THERE.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.022
- START AT THE DOCKS.

38:25.970 --> 38:29.462
[ominous music]

38:29.500 --> 38:37.509
*

38:41.920 --> 38:43.911
[metallic scratching]

38:56.730 --> 38:57.719
[clang!]

38:57.760 --> 39:00.467
- SHH'
- SHH!

39:01.640 --> 39:03.767
[whispering]
I GOT SOMETHING.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.904
[metallic scratching
continues]

39:05.940 --> 39:09.376
I'M GONNA TURN THIS ON.

39:10.180 --> 39:13.968
- FREEZE!

39:14.010 --> 39:15.409
- PUT THE GUN DOWN, FRED!

39:15.450 --> 39:16.417
NO ONE NEEDS TO GET HURT.

39:16.450 --> 39:18.111
- LEAVE US ALONE.

39:18.150 --> 39:19.549
HE DIDN'T DO IT!

39:19.590 --> 39:21.615
- YEAH, BUT YOU DID, FRED.

39:21.660 --> 39:22.581
WE KNOW EVERYTHING.

39:22.620 --> 39:24.622
COPS SEARCHED YOUR BANK RECORDS,

39:24.660 --> 39:27.629
FOUND THE $5,000 PAYMENT
YOU MADE TO MERCER LAWRENCE

39:27.660 --> 39:28.991
TH REE YEARS AGO.

39:29.030 --> 39:31.396
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!

39:31.430 --> 39:32.624
- MAN, YOU SURE DO.

39:32.670 --> 39:34.535
YOU COULDN'T AFFORD FOR CARL
TO GET CONVICTED

39:34.570 --> 39:35.639
IN THAT RESTAURANT ROBBERY,

39:35.670 --> 39:37.763
SO YOU PAID OFF
THE EYEWITNESS

39:37.800 --> 39:39.631
TO FINGER THANE
AS THE CULPRIT,

39:39.670 --> 39:41.137
AND THEN YOU PLANTED THE GUN
IN THANE'S CAR.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.137
- SHUT UP.

39:42.180 --> 39:43.977
- ALL TO COVER UP A MURDER
THAT YOU COMMITTED

39:44.010 --> 39:45.546
IN YOUR OWN KNUCKLEHEAD YOUTH.

39:45.580 --> 39:47.571
- LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON.

39:47.610 --> 39:49.874
- WAIT, THIS IS ALL
TO COVER UP A MURDER

39:49.920 --> 39:51.012
THAT YOU COMMITTED?

39:51.050 --> 39:52.586
- JUST SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

39:52.620 --> 39:54.019
- ALL THIS TIME,
I'M THINKING YOU'RE DOING THIS

39:54.050 --> 39:56.553
TO MAKE SURE
THEY WOULDN'T TAKE ME FROM YOU.

39:56.590 --> 39:59.479
WHY YOU DIDN'T TELL ME, DAD?

39:59.530 --> 40:02.658
- I'M NOT GOING TO JAIL
BECAUSE OF YOU.

40:02.700 --> 40:06.659
- I'M NOT NO MURDERER, MAN.

40:06.700 --> 40:09.737
TURNING MYSELF IN.

40:20.250 --> 40:22.912
[gun clatters on the floor]

40:22.950 --> 40:24.110
- DON'T SHOOT HIM, LASSIE.

40:24.150 --> 40:25.640
- HE'S UNARMED.
- HE'S JUST A KID.

40:25.690 --> 40:26.645
- HE'S UNARMED, LASSIE.

40:26.690 --> 40:28.043
- COME WITH ME, CARL.
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

40:28.090 --> 40:31.082
- TURN AROUND!
HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD!

40:40.000 --> 40:42.594
- WELL, BECAUSE OF US,
THANE GOT HIS RESTITUTION.

40:42.640 --> 40:44.164

40:45.970 --> 40:47.062
AFTER BEING
WRONGFULLY CONVICTED.

GREAT THINGS

40:48.840 --> 40:49.499
ABOUT YOU, JULES.

40:49.540 --> 40:51.201
THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS,

40:51.240 --> 40:54.038
YOU NEVER GOT CAUGHT UP
IN PETTY COMPETITIVENESS.

40:54.080 --> 40:56.048

TOO BAD I HAD TO SPEND

41:20.070 --> 41:21.731
TWO YEARS AND EIGHT MONTHS
IN PRISON FIRST.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.634
- IT WOULD'VE TAKEN YOU LONGER
TO GET THE RESTAURANT

41:23.680 --> 41:24.772
IF YOU HADN'T GONE TO JAIL.

41:24.810 --> 41:26.801

41:59.110 --> 42:00.771
- OH, YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT.

42:00.810 --> 42:01.811
EVEN IF THE--

42:01.850 --> 42:02.874
- IT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF TOWN.

42:02.920 --> 42:03.875

42:03.920 --> 42:05.888

42:11.790 --> 42:14.156
- YES, HE DID,
BUT HE ALSO SPENT

42:14.190 --> 42:16.124
ALMOST THREE YEARS IN JAIL
FOR A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

42:16.160 --> 42:17.821
I THINK WE CAN GIVE HIM
A FREEBIE.

42:17.860 --> 42:18.792
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
[tires squealing]

42:18.830 --> 42:20.661
[horn blares]
OKAY, THAT WAS A RED LIGHT.

42:20.700 --> 42:21.928
- COME ON, JULES.

42:21.970 --> 42:23.164
- DID HE GIVE YOU THE CHECK?

42:23.200 --> 42:24.599
- I THOUGHT HE GAVE YOU
THE CHECK.

42:24.640 --> 42:25.732
