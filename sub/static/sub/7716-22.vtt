WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:03.252
No, no, no
no, no, no, no

00:04.546 --> 00:07.131
No, no, no, no
no, no, no, no.

00:07.841 --> 00:08.841
No

00:08.925 --> 00:10.551
Okay, fine

00:10.635 --> 00:13.012
Ryan, is something the matter?
Yeah

00:14.639 --> 00:15.848
Smokey's dead

00:16.265 --> 00:18.392
Smokey the Bear?

00:18.560 --> 00:20.060
Smokey Robinson, Pam

00:20.145 --> 00:21.645
He died like
an hour ago

00:21.730 --> 00:22.896
I guess I'm the
first to know

00:23.481 --> 00:25.691
Wow, that's terrible
I really liked him.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.776
Oh, you liked him?
That's nice.

00:27.861 --> 00:31.196
Did you like when he changed the course of
American music like, two or three times?

00:31.281 --> 00:33.282
Did you like that
Tracks of My Tears

00:33.366 --> 00:35.868
is maybe the last true
love song ever written?

00:35.952 --> 00:37.369
I'm glad you
like him, Jim

00:37.454 --> 00:39.455
devastated right now

00:39.914 --> 00:42.416
Well, I second that emotion.
Huh?

00:42.709 --> 00:44.835
I know a few of his songs,
but what were his big ones?

00:44.919 --> 00:47.254
Oh, God, Nellie.
What wasn't his?

00:47.338 --> 00:49.214
Tracks of My Tears.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.716
Yeah

00:50.800 --> 00:52.051
God, so many, Nellie

00:52.135 --> 00:53.552
No, no, no

00:53.636 --> 00:55.471
Tracks of My Tears
and what else?

00:55.555 --> 00:57.890
What are some more?
What's one more?

00:59.184 --> 01:02.311
Okay, I'm not I'm not playing
this game, Pam. Not today

01:02.687 --> 01:04.354
I don't think you love
Smokey Robinson.

01:04.438 --> 01:07.566
All of this to prove how
deep you are about music

01:07.650 --> 01:11.361
Okay, I'm sorry that I'm not a fan
of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.613
You don't like
the Beatles?

01:12.697 --> 01:13.906
That's not the point

01:13.990 --> 01:15.783
Eleanor Rigby?
Paperback Writer?

01:15.867 --> 01:18.243
You always think you have time to
see these legends before they go.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.620
What was I so
busy doing?

01:19.746 --> 01:22.873
It says here the Smokey
Robinson dead thing is a hoax

01:22.957 --> 01:24.666
It's on CNN as of
two minutes ago.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.504
Okay, well
That's a relief

01:29.005 --> 01:30.047
Wow, look at that

01:30.131 --> 01:32.216
Says he's actually
playing State College

01:32.300 --> 01:33.509
That's only three
hours away

01:34.219 --> 01:36.845
Oh, my God, Ryan
that's perfect.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.055
You have to go

01:38.139 --> 01:39.681
Tickets are
250 bucks.

01:40.058 --> 01:44.186
$250 is nothing to the world's
biggest Smokey Robinson fan

01:45.355 --> 01:46.480
Yeah

01:47.357 --> 01:49.566
Who's opening?
Paul Anka

01:49.651 --> 01:50.984
Paul Anka?

01:51.861 --> 01:54.613
How can they make the Smoke Man
play with someone like that?

01:56.533 --> 01:57.950
Okay, you could just
show up late, though

01:58.118 --> 01:59.451
How much is parking
like, 30 bucks?

01:59.536 --> 02:01.453
That's not what Smokey
would have wanted

02:01.538 --> 02:02.955
Does want

02:03.039 --> 02:05.457
Tears of a Clown. Don't
call me a clown, Pam

02:05.542 --> 02:06.875
You're better than that

02:08.000 --> 02:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:34.195 --> 02:35.320
Looking good, RC

02:37.240 --> 02:38.740
I feel like I'm
being strangled

02:38.825 --> 02:43.328
like I'm at some erotic
asphyxiation sex club over on I-84.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.247
The Red Room, say
or Dominick's

02:45.373 --> 02:48.167
Robert, the Senator was going
to wear dark brown tonight.

02:50.336 --> 02:51.587
I'm sure it'll be fine

02:51.671 --> 02:55.841
My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser
tonight for local dog shelters

02:55.925 --> 02:59.052
Robert California bought
two tables for everyone here

02:59.137 --> 03:00.721
These people were
lucky to get seats

03:00.805 --> 03:04.641
because it is going to be a who's
who of the northern 22nd district

03:08.146 --> 03:10.981
but there is a distinct chance
that we're all about to be killed

03:11.065 --> 03:12.566
Well, as long as you don't
want to alarm people

03:12.734 --> 03:15.319
What's going on? There's a
disgruntled ex-employee

03:15.403 --> 03:17.154
sitting in his car
in the parking lot

03:17.238 --> 03:18.780
Oh, that's Andy.
He's just hanging out

03:18.948 --> 03:21.033
That's how workplace
tragedies always begin

03:21.117 --> 03:23.869
A middle-aged white
male "hanging out."

03:23.953 --> 03:24.995
Call the cops

03:25.079 --> 03:26.788
Dwight, I don't think he's
going to hurt anybody

03:26.873 --> 03:28.832
How do you know? I mean, why
do you think he's there?

03:28.958 --> 03:30.542
What kind of weapon he has

03:30.627 --> 03:32.294
Could be a knife
could be a gun.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.963
Could be a series of guns, all
lined up to shoot parallel

03:35.048 --> 03:36.506
I'm going up
to the roof.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.134
I'm going to bring my
gym bag just in case

03:41.804 --> 03:45.307
Everybody told me if I moved
to America I'd be murdered.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.565
Hey
Hey

03:53.650 --> 03:56.818
Just wanted to say hi and hear
you say everything's normal

03:56.903 --> 03:59.696
Maybe videotape you saying that so
that everyone upstairs can see?

04:00.823 --> 04:02.491
We think you
might kill Robert

04:02.575 --> 04:03.617
What?

04:03.701 --> 04:07.746
Because he fired you, which means
apparently you're living in your car now.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.414
Guys, everything
is fine.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.875
I'm just here to pick up Erin.
We're going to the fundraiser

04:11.960 --> 04:13.126
Great. That
sounds good

04:13.211 --> 04:14.253
Wait, what?

04:14.337 --> 04:16.255
You're going to the
fundraiser tonight?

04:16.339 --> 04:17.422
That's going to be weird

04:17.757 --> 04:18.966
Why would
that be weird?

04:19.050 --> 04:20.341
It's going to be
super weird.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.261
He just fired
you last week

04:22.679 --> 04:24.304
Andy's just coming
as my date

04:24.389 --> 04:26.765
Hey, I hear you I hope you're right

04:26.849 --> 04:30.852
It just seems like it's going
to be really, really weird

04:31.354 --> 04:33.480
Come in.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.067
You really redid
Andy's office, huh?

04:37.151 --> 04:38.777
Yes, cut out
the clutter.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.904
Very simple,
very minimal

04:41.322 --> 04:43.865
I need you to sign these.
We got a shipment going out

04:43.950 --> 04:46.326
How are things in
the warehouse?

04:46.411 --> 04:48.078
You could go downstairs
and ask them.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.872
The warehouse
isn't downstairs

04:52.625 --> 04:55.377
Is it?

04:55.795 --> 04:57.379
Who knew, right?

04:58.548 --> 04:59.548
L

05:00.925 --> 05:03.468
Tonight could be the
night that Darryl and I

05:03.553 --> 05:07.723
go from casual work friends
to actual good friends.

05:08.308 --> 05:13.395
The only thing standing in our way is
the contempt he seems to feel for me

05:16.607 --> 05:18.233
Robert, the Senator and
I wanted to stop by.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.776
Hello. Robert.
Robert, how are you?

05:19.861 --> 05:21.278
And say hello
- Hello.

05:21.362 --> 05:24.281
Did anyone order a blast from the
past with a side order of sexy?

05:25.450 --> 05:27.701
Hi, Andy
Oh, man, this is weird

05:27.785 --> 05:28.994
Andrew
Oh

05:29.579 --> 05:31.705
Want to shake
my hand, huh?

05:32.623 --> 05:35.042
Because I want to
shake your body

05:39.172 --> 05:40.714
Where.
Where do I look?

05:40.798 --> 05:43.633
It's been so long since I
did one of these things

05:43.718 --> 05:45.093
Okay, all right

05:45.178 --> 05:47.721
What's the question?
How am I doing? Umm

05:48.514 --> 05:49.765
Great

05:52.643 --> 05:54.186
So, how's the talent?

05:54.604 --> 05:56.938
Grey suit over there
is sending a signal.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.107
Downstairs is receiving

06:01.819 --> 06:02.819
Is that Gabe?

06:03.446 --> 06:04.488
Ladies

06:05.948 --> 06:07.866
How come you look so
decent all of a sudden?

06:07.950 --> 06:09.409
Yeah, normally you
look so stricken

06:10.536 --> 06:11.703
Well, I'm embarrassed

06:11.788 --> 06:13.663
I had to give up
my hair gel

06:13.748 --> 06:15.999
because it was giving me
this angry rash on my scalp

06:16.334 --> 06:18.585
And I just gave up
on this low-protein diet

06:18.669 --> 06:20.962
that I was doing
for eight years, so

06:21.839 --> 06:25.217
Ladies seem to like it, plus I'm getting,
like, half as many bladder infections

06:25.635 --> 06:27.010
Wow
Yeah.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.262
Wow You ladies look
very pretty as well

06:29.806 --> 06:32.057
Thanks
Why is it that things are

06:32.141 --> 06:34.309
their most beautiful
in the autumn of their lives?

06:37.188 --> 06:38.355
You had to say that

06:38.940 --> 06:40.524
Sorry. Sorry.
Thanks

06:40.608 --> 06:41.650
Yeah

06:41.818 --> 06:45.904
Creed, I just bid $20
on six jujitsu lessons

06:46.322 --> 06:48.073
No one's
raping this guy

06:48.157 --> 06:49.741
Well, I don't
want to get raped

06:50.952 --> 06:52.994
No, it was my idea to
not be raped Oh, well.

06:53.079 --> 06:56.081
Wait, you think that
jujitsu classes cost $22?

06:56.165 --> 06:57.416
If you're going to
play guess the price

06:57.500 --> 06:59.251
you might as well try
and be halfway accurate

06:59.335 --> 07:00.794
$180

07:00.878 --> 07:02.129
Whoa

07:02.213 --> 07:03.547
Dwight, I don't think
you understand.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.757
You guess the price
you win the prize

07:05.842 --> 07:08.760
Have you never been
to a Quaker fair before?

07:10.096 --> 07:11.179
God

07:11.931 --> 07:15.392
So, Dwight doesn't
understand silent auctions.

07:17.019 --> 07:20.147
Guy in the office. Huh?

07:21.357 --> 07:24.109
Because up until now
we didn't have one

07:24.652 --> 07:25.694
What haven't I been doing?

07:26.028 --> 07:28.572
Gosh, just today I was working on
this rock opera that I'm writing

07:28.656 --> 07:31.199
although it feels more like I'm
receiving it than writing it

07:31.576 --> 07:33.618
Wow, that's
exciting

07:34.162 --> 07:36.746
But until you firm up the idea, you
might want to keep it between us

07:36.831 --> 07:39.416
The hero lives in
this dystopian future

07:39.500 --> 07:43.587
and he flies around in a spaceship
that's shaped like a treble clef.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.423
And he has to sing his heart
out to destroy all evil

07:47.049 --> 07:48.216
Sounds like you're
doing all right.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.594
A little better than
all right, actually.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.804
Really good

07:53.055 --> 07:54.514
Have you thought about
getting into photography?

07:54.765 --> 07:56.850
Are you kidding me?
'Cause I'm way into it

07:56.934 --> 07:58.643
What are you
taking pictures of?

07:58.728 --> 07:59.769
Children?
Yes

07:59.854 --> 08:00.979
Homeless people?
Yes

08:01.063 --> 08:02.647
'Cause in a way
they're more real

08:02.732 --> 08:04.483
...than the rest of us!
The rest of us

08:04.984 --> 08:07.027
This guy's
having a breakdown

08:07.195 --> 08:10.572
You know, Oscar, I really had no idea that
you were so passionate about animals.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.365
My dog, Gerald is my life.
Really?

08:12.450 --> 08:14.201
Well, if you want to
get involved, call me

08:14.911 --> 08:16.203
This is my cell

08:16.913 --> 08:20.290
I'm more likely to
pick up at night, say

08:21.876 --> 08:23.251
after 9:00

08:24.879 --> 08:26.213
Excuse me

08:26.797 --> 08:28.006
This confirms three things

08:28.090 --> 08:32.135
I'm right about the Senator, I
still got it and poor Angela.

08:33.261 --> 08:34.888
Got the flowers.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.972
That piece is
so predictable

08:37.600 --> 08:39.518
Daffodils in spring I wonder what's next

08:39.602 --> 08:40.602
mistletoe at Christmas?

08:41.604 --> 08:42.604
Yeah

08:42.688 --> 08:44.981
Oh! It says, "You're welcome
to take this home.'

08:45.733 --> 08:46.733
Oh

08:47.276 --> 08:50.570
Sweetie, you don't want that Even
in your house, it's a little much.

08:52.114 --> 08:53.114
Have you ever been
to our house?

08:53.199 --> 08:55.283
Not exactly,
but I know the Flats

08:57.203 --> 08:59.329
I'm going to say what
everyone is afraid to say

09:00.248 --> 09:01.498
Phyllis is a bully

09:02.166 --> 09:04.626
A big, beautiful bully

09:05.378 --> 09:07.337
And she is not
getting that centerpiece

09:08.422 --> 09:10.507
Step in right
away and start

09:10.591 --> 09:12.175
Bobby, Bobbo

09:12.677 --> 09:13.885
You're a rock
opera guy, right?

09:13.970 --> 09:15.512
You like rock operas
Well

09:15.596 --> 09:17.055
You've got to check out
this thing I'm working on

09:17.139 --> 09:18.139
It's really cool

09:18.224 --> 09:19.849
There's this character
Thomas Oregon

09:19.934 --> 09:22.894
and he wants to destroy all
the guitars in the world

09:22.979 --> 09:28.149
because he realizes that music is
the one thing he can't control

09:29.485 --> 09:31.945
So, Thomas Oregon
is an evil figure

09:32.029 --> 09:33.238
Evil

09:34.407 --> 09:36.116
Although he's
humanized at the end

09:36.200 --> 09:39.536
because he weeps uncontrollably
and pees in his pants.

09:40.162 --> 09:42.122
And the hero
who is that based on?

09:42.498 --> 09:44.040
Me, I guess

09:45.126 --> 09:48.253
We're flying so high
we're cracking the sky

09:48.546 --> 09:52.591
Going to fly out of this
dome My girlfriend and I

09:55.344 --> 09:57.679
Hey, jabroni,
show some class

09:58.097 --> 09:59.931
She's right, Andy
You're being a jabroni

10:00.016 --> 10:01.433
You're being a
Thomas Oregon

10:02.268 --> 10:03.602
Andrew

10:05.354 --> 10:07.772
I think this may have
been a bad idea.

10:08.482 --> 10:10.942
Why don't you let me
pay for you and Erin

10:11.027 --> 10:13.945
to go out to a great
romantic dinner tonight?

10:14.030 --> 10:16.698
Don't need you to pay for me.
I'm doing just fine, thank you.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.576
Why don't you quit
harshing our mellow?

10:20.161 --> 10:22.245
Andy, you should leave

10:22.330 --> 10:23.371
Now

10:25.333 --> 10:26.625
Excuse me

10:26.709 --> 10:30.211
I would like to purchase two
seats at another table, please.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.297
I'm sorry. The tables are
sold as complete units.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.633
Then I'll take a table

10:34.717 --> 10:35.717
Okay

10:35.801 --> 10:37.385
And a high five

10:38.554 --> 10:40.347
Let's do that again

10:43.059 --> 10:45.393
Well, I just give a
dollar to every charity

10:45.478 --> 10:47.270
That way, you get all the
mail, all the calendars.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.731
You can't believe how much
you get just for a buck

10:50.399 --> 10:52.692
It's also nice to know
you're making a difference

10:53.194 --> 10:54.778
Jim and I give
to the Red Cross

10:55.071 --> 10:56.863
Are you sure you
ought to be giving?

10:56.947 --> 10:59.157
I mean, with your
financial situation

10:59.575 --> 11:00.742
Excuse me?

11:02.078 --> 11:06.331
You ladies are as tangy as the salad
dressing over there. I love it.

11:07.124 --> 11:08.875
Oh, yes indeed

11:10.086 --> 11:11.169
When

11:12.588 --> 11:14.714
Whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

11:14.799 --> 11:16.591
Forgot a few salads

11:21.430 --> 11:28.853
When

11:29.689 --> 11:33.775
I stumbled into a
very dramatic situation

11:34.110 --> 11:36.444
Here, let me move this
so you can see him.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.530
Pam

11:39.949 --> 11:41.408
Pam.
Yeah

11:41.784 --> 11:43.618
Angela's husband
just hit on me.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.454
Oh, my God I know.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.664
Wait, what? Come on

11:47.790 --> 11:50.041
We were talking
about animals

11:51.168 --> 11:52.836
He gives me his
cell phone number

11:52.920 --> 11:54.212
He was just dying
for me to have it.

11:54.296 --> 11:57.632
Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying
you're not dreamy because you are

11:57.717 --> 12:00.510
but isn't it possible that he
was just schmoozing a voter?

12:00.970 --> 12:03.430
Well, if you would have
seen the look he gave me

12:03.514 --> 12:05.140
He wanted to rock
more than just my vote

12:05.224 --> 12:06.307
Okay

12:06.392 --> 12:07.600
What was this look?

12:10.396 --> 12:11.438
Whoa

12:11.564 --> 12:13.231
What happened? Did he do it?
Are you

12:13.315 --> 12:15.150
Twice. For real?

12:15.234 --> 12:17.569
Okay, guys. Not every glance
means something, all right?

12:17.653 --> 12:18.653
Life isn't Downton Abbey.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.029
Life is Downton Abbey.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.114
Here's what
I'm going to do

12:21.240 --> 12:22.615
I'm going to go over there
I'm going to talk to him

12:22.700 --> 12:24.701
And I guarantee you he gives out
his cell phone to everybody

12:34.170 --> 12:38.131
How much do you guys charge for
one full-year gym membership?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.092
Thank you

12:44.013 --> 12:45.597
It's $475

12:47.349 --> 12:49.267
Like candy from a baby

12:54.690 --> 12:57.108
That's the third time you've
asked me about my strategy

12:57.193 --> 12:59.903
It's called "Guess the Price, '
strategy's in the name.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.781
Simplest game since
"Touch the Rock."

13:03.824 --> 13:05.241
Three-time champion

13:05.326 --> 13:07.786
Almost four, but
I touched the wood

13:10.873 --> 13:11.915
Hey

13:13.834 --> 13:15.627
David Wallace?
Andy Bernard?

13:15.753 --> 13:17.587
Hey, how are you? How you doing?
I'm great.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.297
How are you doing? Are you
still with Dunder Mifflin?

13:19.423 --> 13:20.965
No, got canned last week

13:21.675 --> 13:22.759
Oh. I'm sorry
to hear that.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.302
No, best thing that
ever happened to me

13:24.386 --> 13:25.512
That's the attitude
to have.

13:25.596 --> 13:28.139
You know what? When I got
canned I was lost, right?

13:28.224 --> 13:32.060
I poured myself into this ridiculous
vacuum for toys called Suck It.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.354
Yikes.
Yeah, exactly, right?

13:34.438 --> 13:35.480
Then suddenly
out of nowhere

13:35.564 --> 13:39.067
the US Military bought the
patent from me for $20 million

13:40.110 --> 13:41.820
Point is,
forget those guys

13:41.904 --> 13:42.946
Okay? Move on

13:44.114 --> 13:45.490
Good to see you, Andy

13:50.621 --> 13:54.415
Call me a lay man, but I wish
there was some real food here

13:54.792 --> 13:56.835
You know
like hamburgers

13:58.379 --> 14:01.840
or Oreos,
or a pizza pie, or

14:02.758 --> 14:05.593
What's another food that we like?
Tacos

14:05.678 --> 14:10.640
What I wouldn't give
for a big mess of tacos

14:10.724 --> 14:11.975
Tacos.
Right now

14:12.059 --> 14:13.685
some tacos.

14:13.769 --> 14:14.853
Brilliant

14:15.271 --> 14:16.396
If you loan me
some money

14:16.480 --> 14:18.231
Yes, I can do that

14:19.567 --> 14:23.778
For two tacos we
probably need about

14:24.572 --> 14:28.324
what, $20?
Or $25? 20

14:28.450 --> 14:29.701
30.
$30

14:29.785 --> 14:31.494
Yes, yes

14:32.121 --> 14:33.580
I've never eaten a taco

14:33.664 --> 14:35.707
I'm not entirely sure
what they are.

14:35.791 --> 14:40.128
As long as they're not slimy, and
please, God, don't let them have eyes

14:44.675 --> 14:45.925
So?
Boom

14:48.679 --> 14:49.804
This is interesting

14:50.890 --> 14:52.181
Mm-hmm
What is interesting?

14:52.266 --> 14:54.225
He gives his cell
out to everybody

14:55.269 --> 14:57.437
Or you proved that
he thinks you're gay

14:57.521 --> 14:58.897
He doesn't think
Jim is gay.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.648
A gay man would not leave the
house wearing those shoes

15:00.774 --> 15:03.026
A gay man wouldn't leave the
store wearing those shoes

15:03.319 --> 15:05.320
Hey, you bought
me these shoes.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.697
Wait a second
where's the centerpiece?

15:07.823 --> 15:09.991
So I threw it in the garbage.

15:10.492 --> 15:12.911
Really, Phyllis? You didn't
just put it in your car?

15:12.995 --> 15:13.995
Nope

15:14.455 --> 15:16.122
Which garbage?
It's not there anymore.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.583
A man emptied the garbage
into a bigger garbage

15:18.667 --> 15:20.919
and then I heard someone say
they were locking the garbage

15:21.420 --> 15:22.795
You are out
of control, Phyllis

15:23.505 --> 15:26.341
Come on, sweetie. We both
knew how this was gonna end

15:30.137 --> 15:32.513
Before we bring out
our guest of honor tonight,

15:32.598 --> 15:37.769
we are very proud to introduce a great
philanthropist, and a great guy,

15:38.103 --> 15:39.771
Robert California.

15:45.694 --> 15:46.819
Thank you.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.988
Why do we love dogs?

15:49.782 --> 15:51.616
Want me to tell you why?

15:51.700 --> 15:53.326
There is no answer.

15:53.410 --> 15:56.913
Our love for them
confounds reason.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.915
Do you believe this guy?

15:58.999 --> 16:01.876
The State Senator Robert
Lip\ton loves dogs.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.712
He asked me if I loved dogs.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.298
You know what I said?

16:07.383 --> 16:08.424
Yes.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.428
Not a joke. That,
that was not even a joke

16:12.513 --> 16:15.932
Bella here was a
therapy dog for 10 years.

16:16.016 --> 16:20.645
When her owner passed away, she came
to this organization for placement.

16:20.729 --> 16:24.232
But people don't often
adopt older dogs.

16:24.608 --> 16:29.153
So Bella and 11
heroes like her

16:29.905 --> 16:33.658
are being cared for by
our generous volunteers

16:33.742 --> 16:35.785
because, frankly,
nobody else will.

16:39.206 --> 16:42.083
Of those dogs

16:42.459 --> 16:43.918
Andy, that's very
kind, but...

16:44.003 --> 16:48.006
No, no, no This guy can
talk and talk all he wants

16:48.090 --> 16:49.799
but it's not that
complicated.

16:49.925 --> 16:52.427
Andy, why don't we discuss this...
No, no, no. It's about

16:52.511 --> 16:56.973
being there for someone after it's become
inconvenient for them to be around

16:57.307 --> 16:59.100
Hello, everyone.
I'm Andy Bernard

16:59.184 --> 17:03.104
and I am going to take
that bitch home.

17:05.273 --> 17:07.567
That is a female
dog reference.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.486
This bitch
understands loyalty

17:10.570 --> 17:12.030
Sassy human reference

17:12.114 --> 17:14.615
Thank you.
I will take Bella

17:15.034 --> 17:16.034
Aw

17:16.326 --> 17:18.411
And every single
one of her friends

17:18.494 --> 17:19.746
Oh, God

17:22.624 --> 17:23.875
This way

17:23.959 --> 17:26.002
Hope you all learned
something Okay.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.215
Huey's going to need his
medication once every 90 minutes.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.176
You can administer it orally,
but he's going to puke it up

17:33.260 --> 17:34.677
So other end's best

17:34.928 --> 17:38.181
Don't split up Daisy and Mojo
because Daisy will start to...

17:38.265 --> 17:40.892
I was going to say bark
but it's more of a scream

17:41.018 --> 17:43.853
I'm so ready to love
all of these animals

17:44.146 --> 17:46.522
This one's even bonding
with me already.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.357
A therapy dog.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.818
He apparently thinks you're in
some kind of emotional crisis.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.614
Stupid dog

17:54.990 --> 17:58.493
If you would like to talk about this
some more, my door is always open

17:58.577 --> 18:01.162
So here's my office number
and my cell number.

18:01.246 --> 18:02.872
Thank you.
Okay

18:03.665 --> 18:05.208
Well, it looks like he
really did just want

18:05.292 --> 18:07.001
to talk about the issues
I'm sorry, Oscar

18:07.127 --> 18:10.254
No, sorry about what? There's
nothing to be sorry about here.

18:10.714 --> 18:15.134
No, I'm certainly not disappointed that
Angela's husband wasn't hitting on me

18:15.219 --> 18:17.845
I'd have to be a
monster to root for that

18:17.930 --> 18:20.014
A lonely, aging monster

18:21.683 --> 18:23.184
Tacos were on sale

18:23.352 --> 18:24.852
Eight for $3

18:26.188 --> 18:27.688
Oh, great

18:29.024 --> 18:30.108
Okay

18:30.192 --> 18:32.652
Oh. Oh. Oh

18:32.736 --> 18:34.237
These tacos

18:34.363 --> 18:35.863
Mm-hmm
Mmm

18:37.366 --> 18:45.706
Uh.

18:45.958 --> 18:46.958
Mmm

18:47.292 --> 18:49.418
Mmm. Oh

18:50.337 --> 18:51.379
Huh

18:52.381 --> 18:53.381
Mmm

18:54.591 --> 18:56.634
Well, that's hit the spot

18:56.844 --> 18:57.885
Um

18:58.387 --> 18:59.428
Very savory

19:00.514 --> 19:02.473
What do you do with
the crispy holder?

19:02.558 --> 19:04.517
Here, let's try this again

19:04.768 --> 19:06.144
Here, don't put
your finger in

19:06.228 --> 19:07.854
Yeah, just hold it like that.
Hold it to the side

19:07.938 --> 19:09.856
Right
Hold it to the side

19:09.940 --> 19:12.066
Lean it to the side.
Look at me, like this

19:12.901 --> 19:14.402
She's trying

19:15.154 --> 19:18.739
The winner of the three-day
trip to the Skytop Lodge

19:18.824 --> 19:20.825
is Dwight Schrute!

19:20.909 --> 19:21.951
Yes

19:25.998 --> 19:30.209
The year-long membership to
Scranton Bikram Yoga is...

19:30.752 --> 19:31.836
Dwight Schrute!

19:31.962 --> 19:33.254
Oh, yes

19:34.089 --> 19:35.214
Yeah

19:36.425 --> 19:42.638
A one hour appointment with the "Kissing
Magician" goes to Dwight Schrute.

19:42.723 --> 19:45.725
Oh, yeah

19:46.768 --> 19:50.104
Well, I think I can save
us all some time.

19:50.647 --> 19:53.941
Dwight Schrute has
won every single item here.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.484
Thank you very much

19:55.569 --> 19:59.280
All I had to do was look up
the prices, idiots. Suck it

19:59.364 --> 20:03.326
Well, Dwight, yes, you certainly
are a record breaker.

20:03.869 --> 20:07.121
Your donation is the largest
we've ever received

20:07.206 --> 20:10.833
at over $34,000.

20:17.382 --> 20:20.676
Speech

20:20.761 --> 20:22.803
Come on. Speech, speech

20:36.151 --> 20:37.485
Thank you.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.155
Wow, I can't tell you

20:43.075 --> 20:45.868
what an honor it is
to support this

20:47.537 --> 20:48.663
thing.

20:49.164 --> 20:53.292
And obviously that amount of money
is no concern to me whatsoever.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.547
But I want to ask
you something.

20:58.674 --> 21:02.843
When did it become
all about the money?

21:03.720 --> 21:07.682
When did it become about
the flower arrangements?

21:08.183 --> 21:10.142
And the white
wine spritzers?

21:10.227 --> 21:11.269
Hmm?

21:11.353 --> 21:13.479
And all the dinner rolls?

21:13.563 --> 21:15.439
You people should be
ashamed of yourselves.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.025
How many courses did
we have tonight?

21:18.110 --> 21:20.361
Two? Three, maybe?

21:20.988 --> 21:22.571
If you chose the pudding.

21:22.656 --> 21:27.868
These tables tarted up
like Victorian whores.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.204
Let's remember we are all here

21:32.624 --> 21:34.292
for the dog society.

21:34.376 --> 21:37.378
He's what's important,
whatever his name is.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.463
Not any of this.

21:39.548 --> 21:43.634
So that is going to be
my donation to you.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.386
Thank you and good night.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.470
Whoa

21:47.389 --> 21:48.389
Uh

21:53.270 --> 21:55.438
Oscar. Nice to
see you again

21:55.522 --> 21:57.315
It was lovely
It was lovely

21:57.399 --> 21:59.734
And don't forget to call. Okay

22:02.863 --> 22:04.905
Thanks so
much for coming

22:04.990 --> 22:07.408
Why does this always
happen to me? Ahh!

22:08.618 --> 22:10.870
I just feel so
bad for Angela

22:12.080 --> 22:15.082
Apparently, there were some silly
rumors going around tonight

22:15.917 --> 22:17.585
We are very much in love

22:18.670 --> 22:20.921
Very much in love

22:22.382 --> 22:25.092
So it just goes on under
here like this?

22:25.177 --> 22:26.594
That's right

22:26.720 --> 22:28.846
Oh, God. Yeah, you never
get used to that.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.474
Hey, just wanted to check in
to see how you're doing.

22:33.268 --> 22:35.478
He's great.
We're all great

22:35.604 --> 22:36.854
Twelve dogs

22:36.938 --> 22:39.690
This is my life now
I'm a dog nurse

22:39.775 --> 22:41.692
Look at that one,
though. He's smiling

22:41.777 --> 22:44.236
Yeah, he should be It's his
first day without a muzzle

22:45.072 --> 22:48.407
This is the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.326
Absolutely, it's
Yes

22:50.410 --> 22:51.494
Awesome.
I'm sorry

22:51.578 --> 22:52.953
Are you guys nuts?

22:53.455 --> 22:54.497
He's not doing great

22:54.623 --> 22:55.956
He was fired

22:56.041 --> 22:57.249
This is terrible

22:57.751 --> 23:01.045
This is literally the worst thing
that has ever happened to you

23:01.129 --> 23:02.296
Not the best

23:08.470 --> 23:09.970
You're right

23:10.305 --> 23:11.806
He's right. I am a mess

23:12.057 --> 23:14.350
This whole night I've been trying
to convince you guys that I'm fine.

23:14.434 --> 23:18.813
I guess I thought that if I could
convince you that I'm fine, maybe

23:18.897 --> 23:20.523
Maybe you would
think it, too.

23:24.444 --> 23:27.446
I'm sorry,
it's just, I

23:28.323 --> 23:31.367
in a lot of human
conversations, so

23:31.493 --> 23:34.745
Okay. Well, Andy, listen it's okay
if you don't feel totally settled.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.163
This is all very fresh

23:36.248 --> 23:38.499
Yeah, I mean, admitting that you
need help is the first step.

23:38.583 --> 23:42.002
Yes, and also focusing
on the positive.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.505
Like, I got a lot of good
things going on.

23:44.589 --> 23:47.091
Yeah, like that
rock opera.

23:47.175 --> 23:48.551
You could always
do that, right?

23:48.635 --> 23:50.302
Yeah, I do. I have that

23:51.513 --> 23:52.471
Yeah

23:52.556 --> 23:53.681
You're going
to be all right

23:53.765 --> 23:55.641
No. No, he's not

23:56.309 --> 23:57.435
Yes, I am

23:57.519 --> 23:59.645
Thank you, Kev
You're welcome

24:00.522 --> 24:04.024
Sometimes I feel like everyone
I work with is an idiot.

24:04.359 --> 24:07.319
And by sometimes
I mean all times.

24:08.196 --> 24:09.655
All the times

24:10.866 --> 24:12.533
Every of the time

24:15.328 --> 24:17.746
So, some of us ended up
adopting those elderly dogs

24:17.831 --> 24:18.831
It's been great

24:18.915 --> 24:21.792
Pepper's been getting me out
of the house Going on runs

24:21.877 --> 24:24.378
My dog Ruby
doesn't do anything

24:24.463 --> 24:26.297
She just lays
there all day

24:26.381 --> 24:27.882
She's so chill

24:28.175 --> 24:29.467
What do you
feed her?

24:29.551 --> 24:32.636
Well, I put out Pro Bow Wow
but she barely touches it

24:32.721 --> 24:34.096
She's so dainty

24:34.473 --> 24:35.473
Is she sick?

24:35.557 --> 24:37.016
How are her poops?

24:37.100 --> 24:38.267
Doesn't really poop

24:38.351 --> 24:39.894
It's perfect

24:39.978 --> 24:41.312
Nothing to pick up

24:41.396 --> 24:44.064
She just kind of lies there
all day like a good girl.

24:46.234 --> 24:49.528
But I have to prop her eyes
open so she can see it.

24:49.738 --> 24:50.779
Does she smell?

24:50.864 --> 24:52.406
She smells horrible

24:52.491 --> 24:53.741
It's unbelievable

24:53.825 --> 24:55.993
But I don't want to
put her in the bath

24:56.077 --> 24:58.287
'Cause I'm afraid
that she'll drown

25:00.373 --> 25:03.209
People seem awful
interested in you, Ruby

25:03.793 --> 25:06.337
Guess they're
just jealous, right?

25:06.421 --> 25:08.255
Yeah, that a girl

25:08.340 --> 25:09.757
That a girl

25:09.841 --> 25:11.091
Man, that stinks

25:12.305 --> 25:18.594
