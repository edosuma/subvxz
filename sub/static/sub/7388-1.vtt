These statues are made
from some kind of sand.

04:16.322 --> 04:21.351
That statue will be found,
and I will find it.

11:01.527 --> 11:03.461
Hey, great show. - Thank you.

- One with Showbiz?

11:19.445 --> 11:21.243
Yes. He's cancelled
that and given it to us.

11:21.313 --> 11:22.576
Amazing. - I know.

11:22.648 --> 11:23.740
And the credit goes to.

Credit goes to Meera.

11:27.019 --> 11:27.952
Yeah right. - Where is she?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.488
She must be in her makeup room.

11:44.136 --> 11:44.830
This way.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.572
Meera, lwould like
to introduce you to someone.

What a memory.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.282
And what a figure.

11:59.852 --> 12:01.843
You're looking really
hot in that shon skin, Meera?

12:03.122 --> 12:03.884
You know, babes.

12:05.791 --> 12:09.193
In the glamour industry,
the shoncut to success.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.559
Is shon skin! - Oh.

12:13.766 --> 12:16.133
I think you know very
well to the fashion industry.

12:16.535 --> 12:18.526
Why don't you clearly
say that I am a b***

12:18.804 --> 12:22.934
Oh..supermodel from
Milan and such attitude.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.835

For your campaign.

12:48.701 --> 12:49.862
It's going to be the best campaign.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.926
...and no one would've
seen this before.

12:52.171 --> 12:53.229
I am telling you.

12:53.372 --> 12:54.669
Thank God I found you.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.936
Otherwise, in panies like this.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.707
I normally find pervens
who rape me with their eyes.

13:03.916 --> 13:06.408
Come, Rads dear. - Where?

13:06.952 --> 13:08.784
Let's go pany, come on.

13:13.826 --> 13:16.227

13:18.364 --> 13:21.664

13:30.609 --> 13:31.599
I am drunk.

13:32.011 --> 13:33.775
I think I am drunk. - Yeah.

13:34.013 --> 13:36.607
Because you're already
four beers down.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.478
Four beers?

13:39.251 --> 13:40.446
But I have a question

13:40.820 --> 13:44.984
Why didn't I drink
the founh one directly?

13:45.291 --> 13:49.853
Why did I drink one, two and three?
- Because.

13:49.929 --> 13:54.594
Before four, comes three, two and one.

13:57.403 --> 14:00.805
My rustic look..

14:01.774 --> 14:03.037
One more question.

14:04.076 --> 14:05.840
It's an amazing song.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.469
Who made it? - My cousin.

14:08.547 --> 14:09.605
He lives in India.

14:09.815 --> 14:12.841
He makes songs for
all of Andi's shows.

14:12.985 --> 14:14.976
Oh..lndia.

14:15.087 --> 14:17.715

14:32.471 --> 14:35.702
I am telling you, I got so
many compliments for this last show.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.506
A supermodel has become
a big fan of yours.

14:38.644 --> 14:39.702
Do one thing, let everyone hear this.

14:39.778 --> 14:41.268
I'll put the phone on speaker. Okay.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.380
Guys, Radhika has a message for you.

14:43.449 --> 14:44.348
Hi, guys.

14:44.783 --> 14:46.547
Hey, Radhika.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.878
Your "Desi Look" song is a hit.

14:49.188 --> 14:50.383
You guys are rock stars.

14:53.626 --> 14:54.650
And how's aunty?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.862
Speaking in Mumbai language..

15:00.699 --> 15:03.964
Give my love to her, okay. - Bye.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.661
Is the jingle ready? - Yes.

15:06.772 --> 15:08.706
The producer's coming
in the evening to hear it.

15:08.774 --> 15:09.468
Hear it.

15:16.882 --> 15:17.815
Stand straight.

15:20.719 --> 15:22.483
Superb..now put your
hand on the shoulder.

15:26.792 --> 15:27.884
Keep changing.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.291
Very good.

15:34.533 --> 15:35.932
Nice smile.

15:38.904 --> 15:40.030
Don't hold the candy.

15:43.375 --> 15:44.342
Hold it.

15:44.410 --> 15:45.775
Hold it on your eye.

15:56.922 --> 15:58.856
Okay, girls, that's lovely.

15:59.024 --> 16:01.015
Very well done with the setup.

16:01.427 --> 16:02.394
Okay, Meera, now quickly.

16:02.461 --> 16:03.394
Next change. Okay.

16:03.462 --> 16:03.928
Come on, quickly.

16:03.996 --> 16:05.054
Come on, girls. Quickly.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.458
Fine, I'll be right back.

16:17.409 --> 16:18.604
Oh my, God!

16:21.313 --> 16:22.974
Help! Someone help me!

16:25.050 --> 16:26.449
Help me.

16:27.419 --> 16:30.582
Please on the lights.

16:32.758 --> 16:33.884
Someone please help me.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.024
I can't breathe.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.965
Help! Help me!

16:47.706 --> 16:49.037
Meera.

16:50.442 --> 16:51.534
Meera.

16:52.978 --> 16:54.639
Oh my, God.
Meera.

16:54.913 --> 16:56.847
Meera, are you okay.

16:58.650 --> 17:01.176
Megan, just take her details.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.581
And get back to me. - Okay.

17:03.889 --> 17:05.686
Take care. Bye.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.528
How is she, doctor? - She's fine now.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.493
These are anti-depressant tablets.

17:12.631 --> 17:13.928
She needs to take
it morning and evening.

17:15.901 --> 17:17.767
But she should consult a psychiatrist.

17:18.002 --> 17:21.564
She isn't sick,
just some fear..which is in her mind.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.606
Fear? What fear?

17:23.842 --> 17:25.810
I think she's claustrophobic.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.438
She feels scared in closed,
dark spaces.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.278
If there's a sudden power-cut,
or if the liffs stuck.

17:31.617 --> 17:33.551
...she can suffer
a fatal attack as well.

17:34.653 --> 17:37.554
But there must be a reason
for her fear. - Of course.

17:37.723 --> 17:38.918
But she didn't tell me.

17:39.425 --> 17:42.326
You're her friend, you can help her.

17:42.795 --> 17:43.523
0K8'!-

17:43.962 --> 17:44.793
Thank you, doctor.

17:44.930 --> 17:49.527
When I was 10, I and my
parents werat travelling by plane.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.235
The plane crashed.

17:53.505 --> 17:57.305
I and an air-hostess
were the sole-survivors.

17:58.844 --> 18:03.509
Since then..l'm scared
of dark and closed places.

18:05.451 --> 18:06.941
Oh my, God. Meera.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.890
But why didn't you
tell the doctor about this?

18:13.759 --> 18:16.456
I've told so many doctors.

18:16.662 --> 18:18.960
...that now I've lost the
interest of telling anyone else.

18:19.565 --> 18:20.623
And second.

18:21.700 --> 18:26.160
They give me anti-depressant tablets.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.864
"Which I already have.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.275
And. .third.

18:33.512 --> 18:34.877
That doctor wasn't my friend.

18:41.253 --> 18:42.243
Who is it? - Andi.

18:42.688 --> 18:43.712
Hi, Andi.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.314
How are you?

18:45.524 --> 18:46.548
I'm good. With Rads.

18:46.625 --> 18:47.456
Girl time.

18:47.526 --> 18:49.255
But actually I need your passport

18:49.328 --> 18:51.387
What is he saying? - Passport? Why?

18:51.563 --> 18:52.894
For a visa.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.597
But, Andi, where are we going?

18:55.667 --> 18:57.692
We're going to India, like I told you.

18:57.936 --> 19:00.701
You know, Rajasthamphoto-shoot.

19:00.839 --> 19:04.002
But, Andi.. - No ifs or buts.

19:04.243 --> 19:05.574
Send me your passpon quickly.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.201
We need to leave next week.

19:07.446 --> 19:08.845
Andi, I can't do this.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.779
Let's be serious now.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.250
I'm sending my assistant,
you send your passport

19:13.552 --> 19:15.543
Andi, I am serious. Don't push me.

19:15.687 --> 19:17.416
Even/thing's locked, the deal is done.

19:18.223 --> 19:19.452
Hire some other model.

19:19.691 --> 19:20.487
Meera.

19:21.026 --> 19:22.619
Look.. - I am sorry.

19:22.728 --> 19:23.820
Hello. - I can't do it.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.657
Meera? Hello.

19:25.764 --> 19:26.731
What happened?

19:27.900 --> 19:28.890
You know how Andi can be?

19:29.268 --> 19:30.565
He's a bit crazy. - Yes.

19:30.636 --> 19:31.364
Let's go.

19:32.604 --> 19:33.901
Oh my, God!

19:34.406 --> 19:37.569
I didn't know Meera had
such a painful backstory.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.333
Because she cannot fly.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.279
She's scared. She gets panic attacks.

19:42.381 --> 19:43.644
I'll be ruined.

19:44.049 --> 19:45.574
This Smith. He..

19:45.651 --> 19:46.743
He will sue me!

19:47.286 --> 19:48.412
Andi, take a breath.

19:49.555 --> 19:50.522
Look, Andi.

19:51.557 --> 19:55.516
If you have a fear in your heart
you should face it.

19:55.594 --> 19:56.755
Face our fears

19:56.895 --> 19:57.794
I see.

19:57.863 --> 20:01.493
You want me to go to Smith,
face him and say..

20:01.567 --> 20:02.898
"Meera is not available."

20:03.135 --> 20:05.297
I didn't mean you, I meant Meera.

20:05.437 --> 20:06.370
Don't do any1hing.

20:06.538 --> 20:07.733
I'll handle every1hing, okay.

20:07.839 --> 20:08.738
Oh, great!

20:08.807 --> 20:10.104
Look, I'm going to India.

20:10.175 --> 20:11.165
I've to arrange every1hing.

20:11.243 --> 20:12.472
I've to get the locations locked.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.239
You get her there by hook,
or by crook.

20:14.313 --> 20:16.611
I'll do it.
I said I'll do it. Just calm down.

20:16.815 --> 20:17.782
Karan. - Yeah.

20:17.849 --> 20:18.475
Here.

20:19.151 --> 20:20.141
I've copied this.

20:20.419 --> 20:21.614
Clean-up the sound by tomorrow.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.117
Fine, you can do that.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.253
But let me hear first.

20:24.356 --> 20:25.152
I might get a new idea.

20:25.224 --> 20:25.588
Yeah, play it.

20:25.657 --> 20:27.557
Stop messing around.

20:27.626 --> 20:29.856
Let's just watch
the match now. Please.

20:30.128 --> 20:32.256
Yeah, they're all sons
of Messi here. Right.

20:32.464 --> 20:33.522
Let's watch the match.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.328
Fine then, let's watch the match.

20:35.467 --> 20:36.298
Thank you.

20:38.804 --> 20:39.896
What's that?

20:43.642 --> 20:46.509
Guys. Look what I found.

20:50.282 --> 20:52.216
Do you know what this is?

20:53.185 --> 20:53.947
What?

20:54.419 --> 20:57.354
Lemon and chilly. - Ohh!

20:57.723 --> 20:59.213
It protects the house.

20:59.524 --> 21:01.424
He's gone crazy. - Correct.

21:01.493 --> 21:02.927
Stop joking all of you.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.394
You don't know.

21:04.563 --> 21:06.292
It keeps evil spirits out of our home.

21:06.365 --> 21:07.662
Yeah, just like I'm
going to throw this out.

21:07.733 --> 21:08.791
What are you doing?

21:08.867 --> 21:11.666
I'll slap you silly.

21:11.737 --> 21:13.762
And hang you at the door.

21:13.839 --> 21:14.772
Look.. - Shut up.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.535
Listen, the second
half's going to begin.

21:16.608 --> 21:17.666
Switch on the game.

21:17.743 --> 21:19.438
Such a bore.

22:58.009 --> 23:06.781
"Without you..my heart's restless."

23:06.918 --> 23:10.377
"Come back to me, beloved."

23:11.757 --> 23:12.815
Leela.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.619
"Without you..my heart's restless."

23:15.127 --> 23:19.462
Leela's statue will be unique.

23:33.445 --> 23:35.345
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.678
He's riding the bike, I'll tell him.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.217
Thank you, thank you.

23:39.818 --> 23:43.846
Karan, Harpal really loved
the jingle we made for his ad.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.584
He's coming in the evening,
with a cheque.

23:46.925 --> 23:47.858
Karan.

23:48.226 --> 23:50.354
Karan. Are you listening?

23:51.463 --> 23:55.832
Rajiv, did you hear the
record I gave you for cleanup?

23:56.468 --> 23:57.799
Yes. - One that we found in the truck.

23:58.236 --> 23:58.828
Yes, I did.

23:58.904 --> 24:00.201
I cleaned up the sound.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.171
Did you feel anything
while listening to it?

24:03.408 --> 24:06.378
Feel? It's amazing.

24:06.678 --> 24:08.510
I even made it my ringtone.

24:08.647 --> 24:09.739
Did you hear it? - No!

24:11.516 --> 24:12.506
I didn't hear it.

24:12.651 --> 24:14.210
Karan, it's a fantastic song, Karan.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.583
We'll make a great remix of it.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.534
"L'm in a party mood."

24:33.605 --> 24:35.300
"Take me shopping dude."

24:35.373 --> 24:37.171
"Give me Dollars or Pounds."

24:37.242 --> 24:38.801
"Oh my love, don't be rude."

24:38.877 --> 24:40.641
"l'm in a party mood."

24:40.712 --> 24:42.441
"Take me shopping dude."

24:42.514 --> 24:44.209
"Give me Dollars or Pounds."

24:44.282 --> 24:46.376
"Oh my love, don't be rude."

24:46.485 --> 24:48.317
"Rude. ."

24:48.386 --> 24:49.876
"Rude. ."

24:50.121 --> 24:51.714
"One, two, three, four.."

24:51.790 --> 24:53.519
"My arms are on your waist."

24:53.592 --> 24:55.321
"My hands are being naughty."

24:55.393 --> 24:57.122
"Let's not go back home."

24:57.195 --> 24:58.754
"One, two, three, four.."

24:58.830 --> 25:00.559
"My arms on your waist."

25:00.632 --> 25:02.430
"My hands are being naughty."

25:02.501 --> 25:04.526
"Let's not go back home."

25:05.103 --> 25:07.572
I've heard that a themed
restaurant just opened up.

25:07.639 --> 25:09.630
And you know what,
it looks like an airplane.

25:09.708 --> 25:11.233
Plane? - Plane!

25:11.409 --> 25:13.104
But it's a restaurant, right?
- Exactly.

25:14.779 --> 25:16.873
Shall we party in the evening?

25:18.183 --> 25:21.517
Are you coming from
privete jet. - Yes.

25:21.853 --> 25:22.752
Girls.

25:22.921 --> 25:23.888
Cheers.

25:25.757 --> 25:27.486
One more, one more.

25:27.893 --> 25:29.520
I finished it.

25:30.395 --> 25:30.918
Yeah!

25:31.162 --> 25:32.288
We should get one more.

25:32.497 --> 25:34.158
No, I think you've had enough.

25:34.633 --> 25:36.397
No, no, cheating.

25:39.638 --> 25:41.333
One more! One more!

25:41.473 --> 25:43.237
Meera, shall we go eat?

25:43.408 --> 25:45.376
Airport-themed restaurant. - Airport?

25:45.477 --> 25:47.377
Yeah. Remember, ljust told you.

25:47.445 --> 25:49.914
The same restaurant. - Yes.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.478
Let's go. Come on.

26:11.202 --> 26:13.603
Hi, girls.
How are you? - How is everybody?

26:13.905 --> 26:15.669
'My rustic look..'

26:15.740 --> 26:17.538
"Fair boys."

26:19.444 --> 26:21.310
But don't drink too
much on the flight, okay?

26:21.379 --> 26:22.505
Rads!

26:23.315 --> 26:25.283
Rads! - What happened?

26:26.451 --> 26:30.513
We're at the airport? - No.

26:30.689 --> 26:32.157
Meera, remember I told you..

26:32.223 --> 26:34.351
"There's an airpon
themed restaurant.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.424
This is the one.

26:35.560 --> 26:36.186
Oh..

26:37.329 --> 26:37.887
What happened?

26:38.229 --> 26:40.527
Meera..stop. - But are you
sure this is a themed restaurant?

26:40.599 --> 26:41.327
Yes. - Speak up.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.737
It's time to take-off. - Candy.

26:47.305 --> 26:50.798
It's not an airport,
it's a themed restaurant, Dodo.

26:51.509 --> 26:53.136
Right, right, okay.

26:53.211 --> 26:54.440
Shall we go now? - Yeah, come on.

26:54.512 --> 26:55.775

Careful.

26:59.150 --> 26:59.639
Andi. - Yes.

26:59.718 --> 27:02.585
We've boarded,

This way, please.

27:04.155 --> 27:04.951
You're so funny. - Welcome aboard.

I hope so.

27:12.831 --> 27:14.822
Tell me, what's your specialty?

27:15.300 --> 27:17.325
I can fly for 24 hours straight.

Fly..fry..either way. - Fry.

27:23.875 --> 27:25.673
Hey, can you get some fish and chips.

28:11.456 --> 28:12.514
Relax.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.651
You're safe, okay.

28:15.927 --> 28:20.160
Meera, l..want to confess something.

28:21.166 --> 28:25.399
We're on a flight heading to India.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.772
But look, don't.

28:40.251 --> 28:44.916
Welcome to Jodhpur.

28:44.989 --> 28:47.481
Meera. Wake up.

28:47.625 --> 28:49.423
Meera. Wake up.

28:49.494 --> 28:49.983
Rads.

28:50.228 --> 28:53.220
Good morning. - Good morning.

28:55.600 --> 28:56.965
Where are we?

28:58.236 --> 29:01.638
Meera, we're in India. Jaisalmer.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.876
Rads!

29:05.243 --> 29:08.008
Just for a contract,
you both put my life at risk.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.442
Meera, I was only
trying to help you out.

29:10.515 --> 29:12.779
Like this? By getting me drunk.

29:12.984 --> 29:14.474
What if I had woken up?

29:14.619 --> 29:15.882
I could've gotten a stroke!

29:17.021 --> 29:19.820
It's not your help, Radhika.
It's stupidity!

29:20.692 --> 29:23.787
What if..l had a panic-attack!

29:24.229 --> 29:26.994
No one could've helped me.
Not you or you.

29:27.232 --> 29:28.791
You would've watched me die,
that's it.

29:29.934 --> 29:32.403
I want to go, right now!

29:33.271 --> 29:33.863
B'! Plane?

29:35.507 --> 29:36.440
Shut up, Andi.

29:38.476 --> 29:39.841
I want to go, now.

29:39.911 --> 29:41.037
Meera, calm down.

29:41.479 --> 29:43.311
Okay. I am sorry.

29:43.414 --> 29:45.382
I didn't think I was
doing anything wrong.

29:46.484 --> 29:47.747
I swear on God!

29:49.387 --> 29:53.051
Look..we'll do as you say. Okay.

29:53.391 --> 29:55.587
But we need some time
to arrange every1hing.

29:55.727 --> 29:56.990
Please, understand.

29:57.762 --> 29:59.560
Meera. Meera.

30:20.919 --> 30:21.750
Meera!

30:51.883 --> 30:53.180
Andi, I'm completely famished.

30:53.251 --> 30:54.980
Can we stop somewhere to eat?
- Yeah, yeah.

30:55.220 --> 30:55.948
There's an eatery close-by.

30:56.187 --> 30:57.416
Driver, let's go to the eatery.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.258
Would you like to eat something?

31:09.801 --> 31:10.563
Some tea or coffee?

31:10.635 --> 31:12.160
Okay, girls,
we're going to be eating here.

31:12.237 --> 31:13.295
Just be careful of the water.

31:13.371 --> 31:14.497
Just have packaged water, okay.

31:14.572 --> 31:15.403
Quickly. Quickly.

31:15.473 --> 31:16.838
Don't you make that face at me!

31:17.242 --> 31:20.610
Meera, it would be really
nice if you eat something.

31:20.678 --> 31:21.543
Okay, never mind.

31:21.613 --> 31:22.637
You don't have to.. Okay.

31:22.847 --> 31:24.372
What are we going to do? - Just relax.

31:24.582 --> 31:25.811
She's furious.
- It's okay, just relax.

31:25.884 --> 31:26.749
She won't do any1hing.

31:26.818 --> 31:28.377
Stop, calm down. - Oh my, God.

31:28.519 --> 31:29.145
Have some water.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.037
Forget that, Andi.

31:48.206 --> 31:50.573
Think about how you're going
to send Meera back tomorrow.

31:50.808 --> 31:53.140
That's what worries me, Rads.

31:54.345 --> 31:55.471
I'm telling you, Andi.

31:56.347 --> 31:58.611
If Meera goes, I go too. - What?

31:58.716 --> 32:00.081
What about our friendship?
- I don't know.

32:00.151 --> 32:01.710
What about us?
- I've said what I've said, Andi.

32:01.786 --> 32:03.413
Who will do the shoot? - I don't know.

32:03.488 --> 32:04.751
You can't do this to me.

32:19.404 --> 32:20.462
What are they doing?

32:20.605 --> 32:23.336
Madam, that's an age-old game..

32:23.408 --> 32:25.342
"Which the girls of
Rajasthan have been playing.

32:41.159 --> 32:42.593
I'm completely famished.

32:42.994 --> 32:44.393
What did you eat?

32:45.997 --> 32:46.987
"Daal-Baati"!

32:47.198 --> 32:48.359
"Daal-Baati"?

32:49.167 --> 32:50.566
Never heard of it before.

32:51.035 --> 32:55.302
But..l'm sure it'll be nice.
Just like every1hing here.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.131
Andi!

32:58.309 --> 32:59.435
Tomorrow.

33:00.044 --> 33:01.170
What time?

33:03.381 --> 33:04.473
Is the call time?

33:07.218 --> 33:08.014
Andi.

33:08.119 --> 33:09.712
Hey, Radhika, welcome to India.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.451
Yeah, we just arrived.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.587
But where are you?
- Just chilling with friends.

33:14.726 --> 33:15.659

33:16.160 --> 33:17.594
So how about you visit us here?

33:18.262 --> 33:20.094
We're here for another 20-25 days.

33:20.164 --> 33:21.222

33:21.566 --> 33:22.533
Well, bye. Take care.

You can hold mine. Want it?

33:41.419 --> 33:43.148
Funny, huh! - Your beer sir.

33:45.156 --> 33:45.782
Thanks.

33:48.259 --> 33:49.351
Hey, smart!

33:50.762 --> 33:51.729
Take your hands off.

33:53.831 --> 33:55.424
Take your hands off. - Really?

34:10.313 --> 34:12.408
Run! Run. - Karan.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.215
Karan.

34:14.485 --> 34:15.350
Karan.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.646
Catch him.

34:16.821 --> 34:17.686
Karan.

34:17.755 --> 34:18.585
Take him to the hospital.

34:18.790 --> 34:20.155
Are you all at the police station?

34:20.425 --> 34:21.449
Are they filing a case?

34:21.592 --> 34:22.525
Is every1hing fine?

34:23.594 --> 34:24.789
No, you can all go home.

34:26.364 --> 34:27.695
Just handle every1hing.

34:28.466 --> 34:29.364
Yes.

34:29.833 --> 34:30.596
Fine.

34:31.302 --> 34:32.201
Okay..Fine.

34:35.473 --> 34:36.871
Nurse, is every1hing okay? - Yes.

34:37.574 --> 34:40.237
Karan, I'll go get the medicines.

34:45.216 --> 34:53.818
"Without you..my heart's restless."

34:56.960 --> 34:57.928
Stop Leela.

34:58.162 --> 34:59.323
Leela!

34:59.397 --> 35:02.298
'Leela's statue will be unique.'

35:07.972 --> 35:09.701
'Angel in the form of human.'

35:09.774 --> 35:10.969
Leela..belongs to Shravan.

35:13.444 --> 35:14.934
Leela!

35:15.480 --> 35:16.538
'Come with me.'

35:16.981 --> 35:21.179
Leela's statue will be unique.

35:21.319 --> 35:22.980
'Beautiful looks.'

35:23.287 --> 35:24.618
Excuse me. What happened?

35:25.857 --> 35:27.552
Only Shravan.

35:30.361 --> 35:32.329
My name's Leela. Leela.

35:32.530 --> 35:34.760
Leela!

35:36.634 --> 35:38.659
Karan. - Leela!

35:38.736 --> 35:39.965
Kumar, get some water quickly.

35:41.706 --> 35:42.798
Karan.

35:43.307 --> 35:44.206
Sit.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.004
Karan, what happened?

35:46.377 --> 35:46.969
Karan.

35:47.645 --> 35:48.407
Karan.

35:48.846 --> 35:49.836
Are you okay?

35:50.615 --> 35:51.582
What happened?

35:52.250 --> 35:53.376
Madam.

35:53.551 --> 35:55.019
Are you okay?

36:02.693 --> 36:03.626
Take your medicines.

36:12.403 --> 36:13.427
Who is Leela?

36:15.373 --> 36:16.465
I don't know.

36:16.841 --> 36:17.808
You don't know?

36:18.209 --> 36:19.370
So..where did you get that name?

36:19.510 --> 36:21.171
Since the day I
arrived in this house.

36:21.612 --> 36:23.376
...l've been seeing strange dreams.

36:24.615 --> 36:25.480
What dreams?

36:26.684 --> 36:27.480
I don't know.

36:27.585 --> 36:28.609
Since the day I moved in here..

36:28.819 --> 36:31.220
...l've been hearing strange sounds.

36:31.289 --> 36:32.984
And I see the same dream all the time.

36:33.391 --> 36:35.917
Rajiv, I've grown
so tired of all this.

36:36.661 --> 36:39.790
Karan, somethings wrong.

36:40.398 --> 36:41.627
Somethings definitely wrong.

36:41.933 --> 36:42.900
We need to do something.

36:44.335 --> 36:47.737
'Sanskrit chants'

36:47.939 --> 36:52.536
'Sanskrit chants'

36:53.311 --> 36:57.373
'Sanskrit chants'

36:57.648 --> 36:58.672
Hey, Karan.

36:58.883 --> 37:00.476
This house is definitely haunted.

37:02.486 --> 37:04.420
There are no ghosts
or spirits in this house.

37:05.456 --> 37:07.515
What about female spirits?

37:07.892 --> 37:10.361
Like I said..he was
talking about some Leela.

37:11.862 --> 37:13.796
No, it's not what you think.

37:14.265 --> 37:17.496
But my dreams. What's all that?

37:17.568 --> 37:19.696
I can't tell you about that.

37:20.538 --> 37:22.973
But whatever it is, it's not good.

37:25.276 --> 37:27.244
You two come see my Guru.

37:28.112 --> 37:31.548
He can chalk out your problems,
and also find a solution.

37:32.283 --> 37:33.478
Your Guru..

37:34.518 --> 37:36.282
Have you heard about 'Nadi-Shashtra'?

37:36.354 --> 37:37.378
Yes, I have.

37:37.488 --> 37:38.717
Something written on old leaves..

37:38.789 --> 37:40.382
They are scripts.

37:41.559 --> 37:44.426
It contains all the details
of every human being..

37:44.729 --> 37:47.824
...from the time of
his birth until his death.

37:48.165 --> 37:49.826
Like..palmistry or astrology.

37:50.067 --> 37:52.832
'Nadi-Shashtra is
no ordinary astrology.

37:53.070 --> 37:57.701
4000 years ago,
the great sage Agustya invented this.

37:57.842 --> 38:00.402
'Nadi-Shashtra' doesn't
make assumptions.

38:00.711 --> 38:03.442
In fact, it tells you the truth.

38:03.514 --> 38:05.642
So, let's go there now. - No.

38:06.550 --> 38:07.779
We can't go there now.

38:08.519 --> 38:11.545
Today I will only take
his thumb impression.

38:11.689 --> 38:13.555
You can come see me four days later.

38:15.192 --> 38:20.858
Until then, may Lord
protect you from all troubles.

38:21.365 --> 38:22.457
Hail Lord.

38:49.393 --> 38:52.693
"L have forsaken my throne for you."

38:52.830 --> 38:56.562
"Come rule my heart."

38:58.336 --> 39:01.601
"O beloved.."

39:01.672 --> 39:05.631
"My beloved."

39:07.144 --> 39:09.909
"..your glamorous eyes."

39:11.182 --> 39:13.344
"..your glamorous eyes."

39:14.285 --> 39:17.846
"They're now my best friends."

39:18.255 --> 39:20.553
"..your glamorous eyes."

39:21.359 --> 39:24.351
"O beloved.."

39:24.729 --> 39:28.359
"My beloved.."

39:28.432 --> 39:31.834
"..your glamorous eyes."

39:32.436 --> 39:34.632
"..your glamorous eyes."

39:35.539 --> 39:37.633
"They're now my best friends."

39:39.343 --> 39:40.936
"..your glamorous eyes."

39:50.354 --> 39:52.288
Okay, I think we're done
with this angle now. - Okay.

39:52.356 --> 39:53.687
Okay. We'll stan with this one.

39:53.758 --> 39:56.591
It's just thatihose flags. - Flags..

39:57.061 --> 39:58.586
Listen, Andi.

39:59.563 --> 40:00.530
No!

40:04.635 --> 40:07.969
"My veil..flies in the breeze."

40:08.038 --> 40:12.373
"And my beloved runs after it."

40:14.645 --> 40:17.876
"Listen to the call of my heart."

40:17.948 --> 40:21.578
"Don't humiliate my love."

40:21.652 --> 40:28.820
"My hear1's..only for you."

40:29.293 --> 40:31.955
"..your glamorous eyes."

40:32.363 --> 40:35.799
"O beloved.."

40:35.866 --> 40:39.325
"My beloved."

40:39.437 --> 40:43.396
"..your glamorous eyes."

40:43.474 --> 40:46.466
"..your glamorous eyes."

40:46.544 --> 40:50.071
"They're now my best friends."

40:50.514 --> 40:52.482
"..your glamorous eyes."

40:54.351 --> 40:55.876
Hey, what's going on here?

40:56.854 --> 40:57.480
Who is he?

40:57.555 --> 40:59.319
Who are these people?
- Greetings, brother.

40:59.390 --> 41:00.084
Greetings.

41:00.391 --> 41:01.324
They are shooting here.

41:01.392 --> 41:02.416
They are from abroad.

41:02.493 --> 41:04.621
Who gave them permission
to shoot here?

41:04.695 --> 41:07.892
We've permission, from the Police.

41:07.965 --> 41:09.729
This place doesn't
belong to the police.

41:09.867 --> 41:10.766
Oh my, God.

41:12.570 --> 41:13.128
Flags?

41:13.370 --> 41:14.496
Who took the flags out?

41:14.572 --> 41:16.062
Wha..what?

41:16.140 --> 41:17.505
What's he saying?

41:17.842 --> 41:20.573
He means flags. - Flags?

41:21.512 --> 41:22.809
We took them out.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.440
It was interfering with our shot,
ruining it.

41:25.649 --> 41:26.980
Ruining your shot?

41:27.485 --> 41:29.044
What have you done?

41:29.119 --> 41:31.417
Bhoop Singh, come quickly.

41:31.522 --> 41:32.455
Boop Singh?

41:32.523 --> 41:34.651
Sir.. Sir, I tried telling you before.

41:34.725 --> 41:35.817
This area belongs to the Prince.

41:45.736 --> 41:47.067
Move.

41:49.940 --> 41:51.066
Oh my, God!

42:07.691 --> 42:08.658
Who are these people?

42:08.726 --> 42:10.319
Sir. - What are they doing on my land?

42:10.394 --> 42:11.384
Sir..they are foreigners.

42:11.462 --> 42:12.554
They claim to be shooting here.

42:12.796 --> 42:14.662
And they say that they've

With your permission, your highness.

42:18.736 --> 42:20.295

42:22.506 --> 42:23.496
Let them shoot.

42:23.574 --> 42:24.769
They're guests of Rajasthan.

42:24.909 --> 42:25.569
Okay sir.

42:41.492 --> 42:43.460
These Indian Prince are so strange,
aren't they?

42:43.527 --> 42:45.359
First shooting permission.

42:45.429 --> 42:46.828
And now dinner invitation.

42:52.670 --> 42:57.836
"Welcome to my country."

43:00.444 --> 43:01.775
I am Maan Singh.

43:02.346 --> 43:04.940
"Khamba Ghani"! - What?

43:05.015 --> 43:07.643
I say "Goodnight".

43:07.851 --> 43:09.478
Why is he saying goodnight?

43:09.753 --> 43:10.948
Should we go back?

43:11.021 --> 43:12.489
Please..welcome.

43:12.990 --> 43:14.719
Follow me. Yes.

43:15.693 --> 43:17.127
By the way, what does the Prince do?

43:17.361 --> 43:18.851
Ma'am, he's the Prince.

43:19.029 --> 43:21.521
He doesn't have the
need to do any1hing.

43:21.932 --> 43:26.369
He just returned from
London few months ago.

43:26.637 --> 43:29.334
And his family? - Here they are.

43:29.773 --> 43:31.605
The Prince's mother and father.

43:31.675 --> 43:35.373
They passed away when
the Prince was just a kid.

43:35.479 --> 43:36.571
Anyway, let it be.

43:36.647 --> 43:37.842
I'll show you something else.

43:37.915 --> 43:38.939
Come. - Let's go.

Come, come.

Come on, let's go.

43:55.599 --> 43:56.157
H9'!-

44:01.872 --> 44:04.842

It's forbidden to touch anything here.

44:10.581 --> 44:12.379
Oh my, God! - Wow!

44:12.549 --> 44:16.679
Look at this beautiful

Oh, I could live here.

Foreign language

You speak French.

45:32.696 --> 45:33.993
Just a little.

45:35.132 --> 45:36.600
I know little French.

45:36.867 --> 45:37.800
It's not difficult.

45:48.712 --> 45:52.546
Guys, our Prince knows all languages.

45:52.616 --> 45:55.677
What's that? - I mean languages.

46:07.498 --> 46:12.527
It's my common language.

46:24.815 --> 46:27.113
The food was good. - A bit spicy.

46:27.384 --> 46:29.443
You liked the food.

46:29.887 --> 46:34.017
Now..take mine. - What is that?

46:34.091 --> 46:35.525
'Paan' (betel-leaf)!

46:35.659 --> 46:37.388
Pick it up slowly.

46:37.628 --> 46:40.563
Put it in your mouth. Chew it.

46:40.731 --> 46:43.132
And..suck it.

46:46.436 --> 46:47.699
That's my great grandfather.

46:48.872 --> 46:50.362
He built this palace.

46:51.675 --> 46:53.109
He fought many battles
in his lifetime.

46:54.044 --> 46:55.443
He was a great warrior.

46:56.947 --> 46:59.917
But you seem a little different.

47:00.751 --> 47:02.549
There's a huge Buddha in your palace.

47:04.121 --> 47:05.714
Buddha gives me peace.

47:06.089 --> 47:08.080
And you know, he was also a prince.

47:09.593 --> 47:10.492
True.

47:10.727 --> 47:15.130
But he also gave up his kingdom,
and lived as a poor man.

47:16.800 --> 47:19.770
Even I was quite poor once. - Really?

47:20.737 --> 47:21.795
Just kidding.

47:23.841 --> 47:25.935
Wow! What a collection?

47:26.109 --> 47:26.905
Great.

47:27.477 --> 47:28.638
Did your dad love reading books?

47:28.712 --> 47:30.840
Yeah, dad loved reading.

47:31.415 --> 47:33.144
I heard about your parents.

47:34.785 --> 47:36.150
God can't be so rude.

47:36.887 --> 47:38.981
I believe, when Lord takes
something away from you..

47:39.056 --> 47:42.959
...he empties both your hands,
to give you something better.

47:43.827 --> 47:45.556
I am sad about my parent's demise.

47:45.696 --> 47:48.188
But you can't spend your
life surrounded by grief.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.065
You can be overwhelmed by grief..

47:51.435 --> 47:53.403
"But you shouldn't
let it be permanent.

47:53.570 --> 47:55.038
We should always throw it away.

47:56.540 --> 47:57.098
Right.

47:58.141 --> 47:59.540
It's beautiful.

48:01.879 --> 48:02.710
Beautiful, right?

48:02.813 --> 48:03.712
Yes.

48:03.947 --> 48:07.713
It'll be just fantastic
if we can shoot here. - I know.

48:07.985 --> 48:09.475
But what about Maan Singh?

48:09.753 --> 48:11.118
He doesn't even let us touch any1hing.

48:11.588 --> 48:12.885
Will he allow us to shoot here?

48:13.924 --> 48:14.652
So what do we do?

48:20.697 --> 48:22.028
I have an idea.

48:23.100 --> 48:23.999
Meera!

48:25.802 --> 48:26.860
You're most welcome.

48:27.004 --> 48:28.028
And the pleasure was mine.

48:28.705 --> 48:30.833
Meera, don't you
have something to say?

48:31.508 --> 48:32.100
Andi. - Rads?

48:32.342 --> 48:32.672
What?

48:32.943 --> 48:34.604
Yeah, Meera, l..

48:35.579 --> 48:36.569
Yes, Meera?

48:38.815 --> 48:43.548
ActuallyRads and Andi
loved your palace. - Yeah.

48:43.620 --> 48:47.318
Didn't you like it?
- Yes, I loved it too.

48:47.524 --> 48:51.859
But we're here to shoot,
and they were thinking.

48:51.929 --> 48:52.623
Be my guest.

48:52.829 --> 48:53.694
It's all yours.

48:54.131 --> 48:55.963
Every1hing will be just the way it is.

48:56.033 --> 48:56.898
We won't.

48:57.668 --> 48:58.726
I'll see you tomorrow.

49:00.604 --> 49:10.537
"When the Lord sees you with me?"

49:10.614 --> 49:13.413
Your highness, shall we? - Let's go.

49:15.118 --> 49:24.391
"When the Lord sees you with me."

49:24.795 --> 49:28.095
"He must be wondering.."

49:28.165 --> 49:35.663
"..how could He give
me such a valuable thing."

49:36.039 --> 49:38.064
"You're amazing."

49:38.542 --> 49:40.567
"There are no words to describe you."

49:40.877 --> 49:43.141
"You've descended from the sky."

49:43.380 --> 49:45.439
"That's all I would say."

49:45.749 --> 49:50.152
"lf someone still
asks..who or what you are."

49:50.620 --> 49:55.456
"l would just scatter
colors in the air."

49:55.592 --> 49:57.720
"..scatter colors in the air."

49:58.729 --> 50:07.865
"When the Lord sees you with me?"

50:08.538 --> 50:11.701
Mr. Lawyer,
if this case proceeds like this.

50:11.775 --> 50:13.140
"Then it will never end.

50:13.510 --> 50:17.174
Your highness, please see
Vikram once and talk to him.

50:17.481 --> 50:19.210
That's the lawyer's
suggestion as well.

50:20.450 --> 50:22.009
What does brother Vikram want?

50:23.053 --> 50:23.986
Talk to him.

50:24.087 --> 50:24.781
Yes, your highness.

50:40.804 --> 50:49.474
"The land..you set foot on."

50:50.514 --> 50:58.786
"The touch of your
feet..turns it into heaven."

50:59.990 --> 51:02.618
"All the adornment in the world.."

51:02.692 --> 51:04.558
"..seem faded compared to you."

51:04.861 --> 51:09.389
"Not just me,
even the Angels are crazy about you."

51:09.733 --> 51:14.295
"You're the breeze in summer,
the sunlight in winter."

51:14.671 --> 51:20.940
"All the weathers owe to you."

51:22.779 --> 51:31.881
"When the Lord sees your attitude."

51:32.556 --> 51:35.821
"He must be wondering.."

51:35.892 --> 51:42.798
"..how could He give
me such a valuable thing."

51:53.477 --> 51:54.672
Meera, your tablets.

51:54.878 --> 51:56.073
I completely forgot them.

51:56.513 --> 51:57.776
I know why.

51:57.848 --> 51:59.942
Some things are best forgotten.

52:00.117 --> 52:01.881
You were right.

52:01.952 --> 52:06.753
Sorrows can be overwhelming,
but they can't be permanent.

52:06.823 --> 52:09.588
But I also said.. You
should always throw it away.

52:10.594 --> 52:11.459
Okay!

52:14.099 --> 52:15.999
Rajiv.

52:17.135 --> 52:18.569
Where's the priest?

52:20.639 --> 52:22.630
Guru's been waiting for you.

52:23.308 --> 52:26.573
Come. Every1hing will be fine.

52:32.317 --> 52:33.284
Guru..

52:34.252 --> 52:36.050
Guru, please help me.

52:36.888 --> 52:39.323
Since I shifted in this house,
not a moment of peace.

52:41.994 --> 52:43.257
I know..

52:44.062 --> 52:46.292
It's because you didn't
shift in the house alone.

52:47.232 --> 52:51.260
You brought some
unwanted memories along.

52:53.138 --> 52:55.106
Memories? - Yes, memories.

52:55.707 --> 52:57.197
Of your past life.

52:59.044 --> 53:03.277
Past life? - Yes.

53:04.950 --> 53:09.251
You're a pan of a 300
year old incomplete story.

53:10.022 --> 53:13.686
And you've been bestowed
this life to complete it.

53:18.296 --> 53:19.730
Guru, what's the story?

53:21.033 --> 53:23.161
To know that, I tried to find..

53:23.869 --> 53:26.668
"The 'Nadi-patra' of your past life.

53:27.305 --> 53:29.205
But I couldn't find it.

53:29.708 --> 53:32.837
And without it the
solution of your problem.

53:34.579 --> 53:37.014
What is that?

53:38.150 --> 53:39.345
Is not there.

53:43.655 --> 53:47.751
But according to your star-sign,
your binh time"

53:48.126 --> 53:53.087
...your stars and constellations,
we've found..

53:53.398 --> 53:57.198
...few pages,
which coincides with another woman.

53:58.103 --> 54:01.129
And her name..was Leela!

54:01.940 --> 54:03.965
Guru, that's the
name he keeps repeating.

54:04.076 --> 54:07.102
That's the name he
thinks about in his dreams.

54:07.179 --> 54:10.672
He will, because it's
an indication from Lord..

54:11.083 --> 54:13.415
...that destiny has
to complete a full circle.

54:13.852 --> 54:18.756
And until it's not complete,
it will keep tormenting you.

54:18.924 --> 54:23.885
That 300 year old threat..has
now turned into a catastrophe.

54:25.330 --> 54:27.731
Guru, what's the solution?

54:28.300 --> 54:30.064
You mean there's no way.

54:30.769 --> 54:31.793
There is.

54:33.038 --> 54:37.236
There is one way..which
can take you to your destiny.

54:37.909 --> 54:39.343
The way of Leela.

54:39.911 --> 54:42.278
Your story is connected with Leela.

54:42.647 --> 54:44.809
So using Leela as base.

54:46.184 --> 54:49.347
...l'll try to show
you the story of Leela.

54:59.831 --> 55:05.235
O Lord..today I am going against
the norms of 'Nadi-Shashtra'.

55:07.606 --> 55:09.973
Only to help this boy.

55:12.210 --> 55:14.474
Forgive me, Lord.

55:16.214 --> 55:17.773
Forgive me.

55:28.727 --> 55:36.157
'Sanskrit chants'

55:37.869 --> 55:43.205
'Sanskrit chants'

56:33.692 --> 56:34.818
Don't move, boy.

56:34.893 --> 56:36.224
Or I'll stab you right now.

56:38.096 --> 56:40.861
What are you looking at, my tormentor.

56:41.866 --> 56:46.565
You'll have to pay the price
of looking at Leela with your life.

56:48.974 --> 56:50.874
I will behead you.

56:51.209 --> 56:53.610
My head's always
bowed before you, Leela.

56:54.613 --> 56:59.210
Behead me, or don't. I don't care.

57:01.086 --> 57:02.576
That's my only regret.

57:02.654 --> 57:04.179
You never stop me.

57:04.256 --> 57:06.691
You don't care for me.

57:08.860 --> 57:11.329
Stupid girl, aren't you ashamed.

57:11.663 --> 57:15.031
Those who feel ashamed,
curse their fate.

57:15.200 --> 57:18.602
If I had felt ashamed,
I wouldn't have fallen in love.

57:18.670 --> 57:23.540
And since I'm in love,
there's bound to be fire.

57:23.875 --> 57:26.674
Take my hand, marry me.

57:29.714 --> 57:30.545
No, Leela.

57:35.887 --> 57:36.718
Shravan.

57:37.922 --> 57:40.914
I don't even have a
small home to offer you.

57:44.029 --> 57:49.331
I feel..that my poverty
might ruin all your desires.

57:52.003 --> 57:53.994
Your hean is my home.

57:55.373 --> 57:57.364
You're my king. My king.

57:59.911 --> 58:02.141
According to our customs.

58:02.380 --> 58:04.314
...Lord Vishwakarma will
be worshiped two days later.

58:04.382 --> 58:08.717
And this time, famous sculptor Mr. Bhairao
will also attend the veneration.

58:08.920 --> 58:13.517
Glory to Mr. Bhairao!

58:13.725 --> 58:16.854
Glory to Mr. Bhairao!

58:34.679 --> 58:39.412
"My wrists jingle..like
the golden bangles."

58:41.953 --> 58:46.948
"As I stretchedmy counyard echoed."

58:48.893 --> 58:52.329
"My fragrance makes
the flowers blossom."

58:52.731 --> 58:56.190
"The moon shines its
moonlight in my lane."

58:56.735 --> 59:02.902
"My anklets are tinkling
and conveying."

59:02.974 --> 59:10.244
"O drummer, your drums.."

59:10.315 --> 59:17.688
"O drummer, your drums are thumping,"

59:17.756 --> 59:21.021
"The drums are thumping."

59:21.359 --> 59:28.823
"O drummer, your drums are thumping,"

59:28.900 --> 59:32.837
"The drums are thumping."

59:37.275 --> 59:40.267
Glory to Mr. Bhairao!

01:00:03.401 --> 01:00:07.099
"L've adorned my eyes with Kohl."

01:00:07.172 --> 01:00:10.472
"l've laced my tresses with flowers."

01:00:14.446 --> 01:00:18.178
"l've adorned my eyes with Kohl."

01:00:18.249 --> 01:00:21.082
"l've laced my tresses with flowers."

01:00:21.152 --> 01:00:24.782
"The dot on my forehead claims."

01:00:24.856 --> 01:00:28.053
"..l've stolen my own slumber."

01:00:29.027 --> 01:00:35.194
"My anklets are tinkling
and conveying."

01:00:35.266 --> 01:00:42.468
"O drummer, your drums are thumping,"

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:46.204
"The drums are thumping."

01:00:46.277 --> 01:00:53.479
"O drummer, your drums are thumping,"

01:00:53.551 --> 01:00:58.318
"The drums are thumping."

01:01:10.602 --> 01:01:17.201
"O drummer, your drums are thumping,"

01:01:17.275 --> 01:01:20.438
"The drums are thumping."

01:01:20.512 --> 01:01:23.846
"The drums are thumping."

01:01:23.915 --> 01:01:28.079
"The drums are thumping."

01:01:32.924 --> 01:01:35.154
Give it here.

01:01:35.527 --> 01:01:37.393
Hit it like this.

01:01:40.565 --> 01:01:42.090
Here. - Okay, Bhairo sir.

01:01:51.843 --> 01:01:52.901
Look, Bhairo sir.

01:01:53.144 --> 01:01:54.339
I made an effon.

01:01:56.915 --> 01:01:57.780
Beautiful.

01:01:58.917 --> 01:02:00.009
Very beautiful.

01:02:01.886 --> 01:02:03.752
But it lacks inspiration.

01:02:05.290 --> 01:02:07.349
And all efforts are
vain without inspiration.

01:02:10.161 --> 01:02:11.890
That girl at the veneration yesterday.

01:02:13.097 --> 01:02:14.087
Leela?

01:02:14.766 --> 01:02:15.324
She's a camel.

01:02:15.567 --> 01:02:17.262
Jumping around in the desen all day.

01:02:17.335 --> 01:02:18.666
Nothing more.

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:20.066
Leela.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.269
Bring her here.

01:02:24.676 --> 01:02:26.144
I will make a statue of her.

01:02:27.278 --> 01:02:29.975
Bhairo sir,
you..will make Leela's statue.

01:02:31.182 --> 01:02:33.082
It's been so long since
you last made a statue.

01:02:34.052 --> 01:02:36.578
You even refused our queen.

01:02:36.654 --> 01:02:39.589
And Leela.. - Like I said.

01:02:40.725 --> 01:02:44.320
To make a statue..one
needs inspiration.

01:02:45.797 --> 01:02:47.196
Go. - I get it.

01:02:47.899 --> 01:02:48.923
I'll go call her.

01:02:52.036 --> 01:02:54.334
Leela. - Shravan.

01:02:54.706 --> 01:02:56.105
You didn't go to Bhairo
sir's place today,

01:02:56.174 --> 01:02:57.335
That's where I am coming from.

01:02:57.642 --> 01:02:59.076
And look what I made.

01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:00.108
Statue.

01:03:00.645 --> 01:03:02.807
Even Bhairo sir praised me.

01:03:03.648 --> 01:03:07.414
Soon you'll be a renowned
sculptor like Bhairo.

01:03:07.752 --> 01:03:11.279
If I can be half of what he is,
I can stan making some money.

01:03:11.923 --> 01:03:13.857
Then I'll marry you
and bring you home.

01:03:14.325 --> 01:03:16.054
And provide you with a square meal.

01:03:16.661 --> 01:03:18.095
But listen. - Yes.

01:03:18.162 --> 01:03:21.962
Bhairo sir wants to make
a statue of you. - What?

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:24.626
Bhairo sir wants
to make a statue of you.

01:03:25.003 --> 01:03:26.630
I don't want to get any statue made.

01:03:26.704 --> 01:03:28.229
Give it to me. - Here, uncle.

01:03:28.706 --> 01:03:30.401
Leela, don't be a fool.

01:03:31.009 --> 01:03:33.205
You know what a famous
sculptor Bhairo sir is.

01:03:33.411 --> 01:03:35.072
And if someone makes
a statue of you in Rajasthan.

01:03:35.146 --> 01:03:36.910
...it will create a stir all over.

01:03:37.348 --> 01:03:38.941
I understand all that.

01:03:39.651 --> 01:03:41.312
Go tell Bhairo.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.814
My name's Leela. Leela.

01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:47.413
Leela, you don't understand.

01:03:47.825 --> 01:03:49.350
Destiny's trying to make you famous.

01:03:49.427 --> 01:03:50.952
...and you're refusing.

01:03:51.095 --> 01:03:52.654
Bhairo sir is a nice man.

01:03:53.231 --> 01:03:55.393
And..l'll be there too.

01:03:56.434 --> 01:04:01.270
Okay, since you're insisting so much,
then okay.

01:04:02.073 --> 01:04:06.237
Come on, make my statue.
- That's more like it.

01:04:06.678 --> 01:04:09.375
Then let's go meet
Bhairo sir tomorrow.

01:04:09.781 --> 01:04:10.339
Fine.

01:04:11.883 --> 01:04:14.375
Now you come with me. - Where?

01:04:15.086 --> 01:04:16.178
Leela.

01:05:40.139 --> 01:05:40.731
I am right here.

01:05:42.875 --> 01:05:45.003
I'll be there with you.

01:05:47.813 --> 01:05:48.905
Bhairo sir..Leela.

01:05:52.084 --> 01:05:53.984
An angel in human form.

01:05:57.289 --> 01:05:59.917
You're more beautiful
than my imagination.

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.091
Bhairo isn't God.

01:06:05.164 --> 01:06:08.691
But I'll sculpt a statue of you..

01:06:10.469 --> 01:06:13.336
"Which will make
you immortal in history.

01:06:15.174 --> 01:06:16.369
Come with me.

01:06:17.242 --> 01:06:18.175
Come on.

01:06:25.984 --> 01:06:27.179
What is this place?

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.719
This is Bhairo sir's chamber.

01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:33.818
Even I got to see this place,
only because of you.

01:06:35.494 --> 01:06:38.691
And you know,
Bhairo sir made this entire chamber.

01:06:38.764 --> 01:06:41.699
...from sand and jute.

01:06:44.937 --> 01:06:46.063
Come.

01:06:58.650 --> 01:06:59.674
Come. - Go on.

01:06:59.785 --> 01:07:00.946
Come on. - I said go.

01:07:08.927 --> 01:07:10.622
Go, sit.

01:07:26.745 --> 01:07:27.837
Sit.

01:07:32.584 --> 01:07:34.109
Bhairo sir, that's your seat.

01:07:36.121 --> 01:07:38.055
From today it belongs
to my inspiration.

01:07:38.257 --> 01:07:42.160
Shravan, I will carve
Leela's statue in a sandstone.

01:07:42.327 --> 01:07:44.261
But sir, that's a rare stone.

01:07:44.763 --> 01:07:45.855
And hard too.

01:07:46.598 --> 01:07:49.192
Leela's statue will be unique.

01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:54.166
I want solitude to make this statue.

01:07:54.773 --> 01:07:55.569
Yes, Bhairo sir.

01:07:55.741 --> 01:07:58.039
And until this statue isn't ready..

01:07:58.844 --> 01:08:02.838
...you'll be my chief assistant,
and tutor all the other students.

01:08:03.315 --> 01:08:04.646
Yes, Bhairo sir.

01:08:05.183 --> 01:08:06.981
May Lord Vishwakarma bless you.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:11.712
I'll start sculpting the statue today.

01:08:12.291 --> 01:08:13.349
Wait.

01:08:23.035 --> 01:08:24.059
Chief assistant.

01:08:25.304 --> 01:08:27.203
You said you'll stay with me.

01:08:27.706 --> 01:08:30.300
Leela..l'll go crazy.

01:08:30.442 --> 01:08:32.069
You don't know what's
happening with me.

01:08:32.944 --> 01:08:33.810
Let me go.

01:08:34.313 --> 01:08:35.212
What do I understand?

01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:36.247
Stupid girl.

01:08:36.682 --> 01:08:38.377
Firstly Bhairo sir
is making your statue.

01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:41.276
And he also made
me his chief assistant.

01:08:41.353 --> 01:08:42.218
Understand?

01:08:42.386 --> 01:08:45.015
That means you won't be here with me?

01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:48.157
Leela..you don't understand
what will happen.

01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:49.825
...if I become the chief assistant.

01:08:49.895 --> 01:08:52.865
Then no one can stop
us from getting married.

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:55.924
Marriage? - Yes.

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.035
And don't worry, I'm right here.

01:08:58.904 --> 01:09:01.032
And Bhairo sir needs
solitude to make the statue.

01:09:01.473 --> 01:09:02.702
Understand.

01:09:03.308 --> 01:09:04.969
Come on now, go and sit.

01:09:05.143 --> 01:09:06.804
Go. Go on.

01:09:07.011 --> 01:09:09.106
And listen..return on time.

01:09:30.301 --> 01:09:33.033
There is no human being or animal.

01:09:34.706 --> 01:09:38.404
No God..or the devil.

01:09:39.845 --> 01:09:41.506
There's no Bhairo..

01:09:43.448 --> 01:09:44.506
...or Leela!

01:09:46.118 --> 01:09:47.846
Just an anist.

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.182
...and his inspiration.

01:09:51.723 --> 01:09:54.215
Until they don't become one..

01:09:54.559 --> 01:09:58.496
"Their Dream's won't become on.

01:10:01.366 --> 01:10:03.232
An desires sacrifice.

01:10:04.603 --> 01:10:07.834
Surrender yourself to me.

01:10:09.241 --> 01:10:13.542
Because history was always
created from total surrender.

01:10:14.246 --> 01:10:18.706
'Then no one can stop
us from getting married.'

01:10:22.721 --> 01:10:32.722
"My fair beloved..

01:10:33.498 --> 01:10:40.370
...welcome to my country."

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:44.810
"My nights are restless."

01:10:44.876 --> 01:10:49.211
"The days torment me as well."

01:10:49.281 --> 01:10:53.514
"Come back to me..beloved."

01:10:53.585 --> 01:10:59.456
"Without you..my heart's restless."

01:10:59.524 --> 01:11:01.788
"Without you.."

01:11:02.627 --> 01:11:05.392
"Come back to me, beloved."

01:11:05.464 --> 01:11:11.267
"Without you..my heart's restless."

01:11:11.436 --> 01:11:14.303
"Without you.."

01:11:24.416 --> 01:11:30.321
"The weathers are not the same."

01:11:30.455 --> 01:11:35.825
"Even the rains feel different."

01:11:40.632 --> 01:11:44.296
Beautiful looks..and
an amazing voice too.

01:11:44.836 --> 01:11:46.201
You sing well.

01:11:47.939 --> 01:11:50.772
Here. Wear these clothes.

01:12:07.259 --> 01:12:08.351
Sing.

01:12:12.197 --> 01:12:17.692
"The weathers are not the same."

01:12:18.170 --> 01:12:23.506
"Even the rains feel different."

01:12:23.942 --> 01:12:29.881
"The weathers are not the same."

01:12:29.948 --> 01:12:34.715
"Even the rains feel different."

01:12:34.786 --> 01:12:41.658
"Like the dried river..

01:12:41.726 --> 01:12:46.357
...my destiny calls
out to you beloved."

01:12:46.431 --> 01:12:52.427
"Without you..my heart's restless."

01:12:52.504 --> 01:12:55.166
"Without you.."

01:12:55.373 --> 01:12:58.172
"Come back to me, beloved."

01:12:58.243 --> 01:13:03.977
"Without you..my heart's restless."

01:13:04.216 --> 01:13:06.810
"Without you.."

01:13:07.352 --> 01:13:09.878
"Without you..my heart's restless."

01:13:10.322 --> 01:13:12.848
"Beloved.."

01:13:13.291 --> 01:13:18.627
"Come back to me, beloved."

01:13:19.431 --> 01:13:23.800
"Come back to me, beloved."

01:13:25.337 --> 01:13:31.572
"Come back to me, beloved."

01:13:36.815 --> 01:13:42.686
"Without you..my heart's restless."

01:13:42.754 --> 01:13:47.590
"Come back to me, beloved."

01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:53.723
"Come back to me, beloved."

01:13:54.833 --> 01:14:01.398
"Come back to me, beloved."

01:14:03.441 --> 01:14:04.806
What happened, Bhairo sir?

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:10.277
Be patient.

01:14:17.022 --> 01:14:18.751
Bhairo said, be patient.

01:14:19.491 --> 01:14:25.919
No, Bhairo didn't tell her that,
it was the Destiny.

01:14:27.866 --> 01:14:29.834
And this wait will be over..

01:14:30.468 --> 01:14:34.666
...at the same place where
this story was left incomplete.

01:14:34.906 --> 01:14:36.897
Whether you want it or not.

01:14:38.443 --> 01:14:40.537
But destiny will take
you to the same place.

01:14:40.879 --> 01:14:44.838
...where you'll be at
a similar twist of the story.

01:14:45.016 --> 01:14:48.543
And the decision you take now..

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.620
...will decide your fate.

01:14:51.856 --> 01:14:55.850
But getting to that twist,
won't be easy.

01:14:56.728 --> 01:15:00.062
There will be many
obstructions on this path.

01:15:00.365 --> 01:15:01.730
"Which will be a
matter of life and death.

01:15:03.868 --> 01:15:08.362
Either they'll take your life,
or give their life.

01:15:22.154 --> 01:15:25.749
King Harshvardhan staned
this Polo Tournament.

01:15:26.225 --> 01:15:32.130
And since then, every year this
tournament is organized in his honor.

01:15:32.197 --> 01:15:35.326
Doesn't your Prince play Polo? - No.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:39.166
He likes watching, not playing.

01:15:39.371 --> 01:15:43.239
Actually the prince
has no greed for the trophy.

01:15:43.408 --> 01:15:45.342
That reminds me, we're hungry.

01:15:45.611 --> 01:15:47.511
Can we eat? - Yes, of course.

01:15:47.579 --> 01:15:48.569
I am hungry too.

01:15:48.647 --> 01:15:49.910
You speak so much,
and don't listen at all.

01:15:50.182 --> 01:15:51.809
I'll show you where
dinner's been served.

01:15:51.884 --> 01:15:53.716
Come, follow me.

01:15:54.286 --> 01:15:57.483
Let's go eat. - No, you guys go ahead.

01:15:57.623 --> 01:15:58.749
I'll wait for Ranveer.

01:15:59.124 --> 01:16:00.353
Okay, I'll get you a drink.

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:02.150
Come, Rads.

01:16:02.461 --> 01:16:03.553
See you. - Bye.

01:16:11.203 --> 01:16:12.466
Congrats.

01:16:13.505 --> 01:16:13.937
Thank you.

01:16:14.173 --> 01:16:16.437
Vikram sir, you won the match again.

01:16:16.675 --> 01:16:17.642
Congrats.

01:16:17.743 --> 01:16:20.405
Vikram's born to be a winner.

01:16:21.346 --> 01:16:26.443
And there's no victory in this world,
that won't bow before Vikram.

01:16:30.455 --> 01:16:31.752
No, thank you.

01:16:34.259 --> 01:16:38.662
Where did this butterfly
come from in this desert?

01:16:47.906 --> 01:16:50.273
Hello, beautiful.

01:16:51.577 --> 01:16:53.671
Hi. Congratulations, Mr. Vikram.

01:16:53.979 --> 01:16:58.917
First time it felt
so amazing hearing my name.

01:16:59.852 --> 01:17:05.655
You congratulated me,
my efforts didn't go in vain.

01:17:06.291 --> 01:17:08.555
You play really well.

01:17:09.695 --> 01:17:13.290
That's the only think I
learned to do best, Baby Doll.

01:17:16.468 --> 01:17:20.462
Whether it's someone
honor..or the Polo ball.

01:17:20.906 --> 01:17:25.605
By the way, where are you from?
- London.

01:17:25.744 --> 01:17:30.978
Wow! This is my first close
encounter with a dame from London.

01:17:32.284 --> 01:17:35.254
Otherwise,
I only see them on the internet.

01:17:37.422 --> 01:17:42.258
I'm sure every pan of
your body must be fair, right?

01:17:43.028 --> 01:17:46.589
Whether every pan of
the body is fair or not.

01:17:47.232 --> 01:17:48.563
"But the heart.

01:17:49.935 --> 01:17:50.959
...should be.

01:17:55.674 --> 01:17:56.664
Madam.

01:17:57.876 --> 01:18:03.007
Why don't you come to my
manor one evening, for dinner?

01:18:03.782 --> 01:18:06.808
You'll love the food.

01:18:07.853 --> 01:18:11.380
I swear,
we'll leave only after breakfast.

01:18:12.691 --> 01:18:14.455
Ranveer, you?

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:21.431
I was wondering only a
Rajput could stop Vikram's hand.

01:18:22.367 --> 01:18:25.997
Don't you see,
I am busy at the moment.

01:18:26.505 --> 01:18:28.371
We'll talk later.

01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:30.872
Brother Vikram, behave yourself.

01:18:31.643 --> 01:18:33.372
Meera is a guest.

01:18:33.845 --> 01:18:37.008
I am not humiliating her.

01:18:38.383 --> 01:18:41.353
I am only inviting
her over for dinner.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:45.315
There are cenain manners to invite
someone for dinner, brother Vikram.

01:18:46.325 --> 01:18:48.589
Vikram has his own ways.

01:18:49.461 --> 01:18:52.055
He doesn't need to learn from anyone.

01:18:52.864 --> 01:18:56.494
Wild animals never
learn any1hing, brother.

01:18:56.668 --> 01:18:59.399
Ranveer.. - And they die like a dog.

01:18:59.604 --> 01:19:00.901
Please.. - No, Vikram.

01:19:01.006 --> 01:19:02.496
Don'tstar1 an argument here.

01:19:02.908 --> 01:19:05.707
Or else it will affect the case.

01:19:05.844 --> 01:19:09.405
Calm down. - Come. Come.

01:19:09.614 --> 01:19:10.479
Come away.

01:19:10.615 --> 01:19:14.108
Bajje..open the champagne.

01:19:14.553 --> 01:19:16.749
I've been victorious today.

01:19:23.729 --> 01:19:25.060
What are you thinking?

01:19:25.364 --> 01:19:26.957
There's such a huge difference
between you and Vikram.

01:19:28.033 --> 01:19:29.831
Doesn't seem like
you two are brothers.

01:19:30.502 --> 01:19:33.995
Meera..Vikram was a bit
spoilt from the beginning.

01:19:34.406 --> 01:19:39.401
After uncle and aunt's death,
he crossed all limits.

01:19:39.578 --> 01:19:40.943
I am sorry.

01:19:41.646 --> 01:19:44.411
But even you lost your parents
when you were quite young.

01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:46.548
And you're a Rajput too.

01:19:46.718 --> 01:19:50.985
But Vikram and you..are
completely different.

01:19:51.523 --> 01:19:52.820
It's the difference in our thoughts.

01:19:53.925 --> 01:19:56.019
For him, respect is
something to be taken.

01:19:57.062 --> 01:19:58.826
...and I believe it should be given.

01:19:59.031 --> 01:20:00.499
He feels proud in
displaying his strength.

01:20:00.565 --> 01:20:01.999
...while I like being sober.

01:20:05.637 --> 01:20:10.973
I know, because you believe
in love and affection.

01:20:13.879 --> 01:20:15.369
I always believed in love..

01:20:16.715 --> 01:20:18.979
"But now I've an unwavering faith.

01:20:20.085 --> 01:20:21.883
Meaning. I didn't get it?

01:20:24.689 --> 01:20:28.455
Look, Meera..l don't
like Misting words.

01:20:35.901 --> 01:20:36.697
Will you marry me?

01:20:36.835 --> 01:20:45.937
"When the Lord sees you with me."

01:20:49.781 --> 01:20:52.512
The Lord kept my hands empty..

01:20:53.418 --> 01:20:54.544
...SO..

01:20:56.021 --> 01:20:56.920
...he could give me something better.

01:20:57.055 --> 01:21:00.457
"He must be wondering.."

01:21:00.559 --> 01:21:06.521
"..how could He give
me such a valuable thing."

01:22:15.233 --> 01:22:19.693
"Your beloveds courtyard."

01:22:19.804 --> 01:22:24.139
"You're now his queen.
Your beloved's courtyard."

01:22:24.209 --> 01:22:28.612
"Your beloveds courtyard."

01:22:28.747 --> 01:22:33.150
"You're now his queen.
Your beloved's courtyard."

01:22:33.218 --> 01:22:37.621
"Your beloveds courtyard."

01:22:37.822 --> 01:22:42.020
"You're now his queen.
Your beloved's courtyard."

01:22:54.573 --> 01:22:56.735
"He's the most handsome and dashing."

01:22:56.808 --> 01:22:59.004
"He took my heart."

01:22:59.077 --> 01:23:03.310
"He stole my slumber..and
gave me dreams."

01:23:12.591 --> 01:23:14.685
"He's the most handsome and dashing."

01:23:14.759 --> 01:23:16.887
"He took my heart."

01:23:16.962 --> 01:23:20.956
"He stole my slumber..and
gave me dreams."

01:23:21.032 --> 01:23:25.299
"Now my eyes..keep saying.."

01:23:25.604 --> 01:23:30.166
"No matter how much one
stops me..l will love him."

01:23:30.242 --> 01:23:32.609
"My beloveds a superstar."

01:23:32.677 --> 01:23:34.771
"My beloveds a superstar."

01:23:34.846 --> 01:23:36.871
"l am a big fan of him."

01:23:36.948 --> 01:23:39.144
"My beloveds a superstar."

01:23:39.217 --> 01:23:41.242
"My beloveds a superstar."

01:23:41.386 --> 01:23:43.718
"My beloveds a superstar."

01:23:43.788 --> 01:23:45.882
"l am a big fan of him."

01:23:45.957 --> 01:23:48.187
"My beloveds a superstar."

01:24:16.221 --> 01:24:20.556
"Last night when he proposed
to me in a filmy style."

01:24:20.625 --> 01:24:24.687
"l didn't look left or right,
just gave him my heart."

01:24:24.796 --> 01:24:26.560
"Rumors spread everywhere."

01:24:26.631 --> 01:24:28.793
"And photos were
published in the papers."

01:24:28.867 --> 01:24:33.532
"l don't care..l'm with a star."

01:24:33.672 --> 01:24:38.234
"My beloveds a superstar."

01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:40.335
"l am a big fan of him."

01:24:40.412 --> 01:24:42.676
"My beloveds a superstar."

01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:56.718
Thanks, Rads.

01:24:57.062 --> 01:24:58.621
You brought me to India.

01:24:59.531 --> 01:25:05.664
And because of you,
I found a life-partner like Ranveer.

01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:08.667
No, Meera, it was your destiny.

01:25:09.474 --> 01:25:13.468
I hope there are no
more sorrows in your life.

01:25:14.079 --> 01:25:16.309
You keep smiling all the time.

01:25:16.481 --> 01:25:19.678
And problems stay miles away.

01:25:21.453 --> 01:25:22.079
Thank you.

01:25:23.288 --> 01:25:24.847
You know, I am going back today.

01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:27.922
Oh, you giving back.

01:25:27.992 --> 01:25:30.927
No, it's going back. - Okay.

01:25:31.496 --> 01:25:35.455
So you want to know
what's in this box. - Yes.

01:25:35.734 --> 01:25:37.532
So open it. - What?

01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:39.995
The box?

01:25:45.477 --> 01:25:49.607
Lollipop? - I've got diabetes.

01:25:49.781 --> 01:25:52.614
And no one lets me eat sweets.

01:25:52.784 --> 01:25:56.687
S0..l Side it. - Hide it?

01:25:56.821 --> 01:25:57.845
Yes exactly.

01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:05.322
Suck on this, you'll love it.

01:26:06.765 --> 01:26:09.063
Rads, we're getting late. Come on.

01:26:09.634 --> 01:26:11.068
Disgusting!

01:26:12.837 --> 01:26:16.102
He's behaving like he
never sucked on one of these.

01:26:32.991 --> 01:26:33.958
What's this, brother Vikram?

01:26:34.025 --> 01:26:36.790
What were you doing
for 25 years in London?

01:26:37.462 --> 01:26:39.089
Can't you read?

01:26:40.064 --> 01:26:41.828
It's a stay-order from the coun.

01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:43.932
Can I ask the meaning of this?

01:26:44.102 --> 01:26:45.536
Look, Ranveer.

01:26:46.137 --> 01:26:48.504
Bhairo Viraj doesn't
only belong to you.

01:26:49.407 --> 01:26:51.102
I've a right to it too.

01:26:51.643 --> 01:26:53.509
You'll make decisions on your own..

01:26:53.845 --> 01:26:56.041
...and turn it over to the government.

01:26:56.681 --> 01:26:59.707
And expect me to watch quietly.

01:27:00.885 --> 01:27:02.114
Look, brother Vikram.

01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:04.946
Its best to handover Bhairo
Viraj to the archeological depanment.

01:27:06.024 --> 01:27:07.992
Otherwise this heritage
will be reduced to dust.

01:27:08.426 --> 01:27:09.416
Then so be it.

01:27:09.727 --> 01:27:10.990
It belongs to me.

01:27:11.429 --> 01:27:13.022
If you act stubborn like uncle..

01:27:14.399 --> 01:27:16.925
"Then you too will
be ruined just like him.

01:27:17.535 --> 01:27:19.833
We've been fighting
this case for 25 years.

01:27:20.205 --> 01:27:21.866
What did you and uncle gain from it?

01:27:22.106 --> 01:27:23.835
Even your manor is mongaged.

01:27:25.477 --> 01:27:26.842
Take your stay order back.

01:27:26.911 --> 01:27:28.879
And I'll split the
compensation money with you.

01:27:30.582 --> 01:27:33.813
I never even took
half-day from school.

01:27:34.519 --> 01:27:36.453
How can I accept half compensation?

01:27:37.856 --> 01:27:40.484
Bhairo Viraj will solely be mine.

01:27:40.725 --> 01:27:42.557
Or it will be no one's.

01:27:42.794 --> 01:27:44.159
That's not possible, brother.

01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:50.934
Ranveer Singh, let's settle this
matter calmly, while we still can.

01:27:52.904 --> 01:27:56.033
Otherwise..the Rajpufs
have a history.

01:27:56.774 --> 01:28:03.146
...of solving matter of land,
women and money by using might.

01:28:05.083 --> 01:28:08.576
Those who are scared of the present,
talk about the past.

01:28:10.021 --> 01:28:11.819
Rajpufs don't turn pages of history.

01:28:11.890 --> 01:28:12.982
"They change time.

01:28:13.157 --> 01:28:18.061
Fine, we'll decide
when I'm holding a gun.

01:28:21.833 --> 01:28:25.201
Don't try to scare me, brother.

01:28:25.570 --> 01:28:29.029
No bullet has the strength
to pierce Ranveer Singh's body.

01:28:30.208 --> 01:28:31.505
And as far as your stay order goes.

01:28:31.576 --> 01:28:32.975
...l'll get it cancelled in a month.

01:28:33.745 --> 01:28:37.272
Ranveer Singh,you might have..

01:28:37.615 --> 01:28:41.574
...to pay dearly for this.

01:28:42.153 --> 01:28:44.087
I will pay whatever the price is,
brother.

01:28:44.589 --> 01:28:46.785
You and uncle think
about paying your dues.

01:28:49.928 --> 01:28:53.023
Vikram, if Ranveer Singh's
willing to pay few millions.

01:28:53.097 --> 01:28:54.587
...give Bhairo Virajna to him.

01:28:54.766 --> 01:28:57.098
At least you can repay some
of your dues. - Brother Samar.

01:28:59.537 --> 01:29:01.232
I am not a beggar.

01:29:05.143 --> 01:29:09.011
My father spent all his
life in finding this statue.

01:29:10.715 --> 01:29:12.240
I Will find it.

01:29:13.184 --> 01:29:17.018
And it'll get me at least a billion.

01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:36.826
Petrol prices have increased.

01:30:36.901 --> 01:30:37.993
Good days haven't arrived yet.

01:30:38.069 --> 01:30:40.333
Go find another car. - Okay.

01:30:40.405 --> 01:30:41.702
600..

01:30:41.973 --> 01:30:43.873
Brother, come here.

01:30:44.342 --> 01:30:45.707
Will you take me to Bhairo Virajna?

01:30:45.843 --> 01:30:47.675
Why walk? It's so hot.

01:30:47.745 --> 01:30:48.371
I have a car.

01:30:48.746 --> 01:30:50.214
1000 for A/C, 700 for normal.

01:30:50.281 --> 01:30:51.407
If you like it, take a seat.

01:30:51.883 --> 01:30:52.406
Let's go.

01:30:52.650 --> 01:30:55.347
Come. - But..you do
know Bhairo Virajna.

01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:57.081
What are you saying?

01:30:57.255 --> 01:30:59.952
There's no place in Rajasthan
that Basant doesn't know.

01:31:00.425 --> 01:31:03.258
Jaipur's Hawa Mahal,
Udaipur Lake, Kota's marble..

01:31:03.327 --> 01:31:04.954
Shall we? - Come on.

01:31:08.966 --> 01:31:12.334
What is Bhairo Virajna?

01:31:12.704 --> 01:31:14.172
'Viral-na' means "Home".

01:31:14.372 --> 01:31:15.635
It's believed that
many hundred years ago..

01:31:15.707 --> 01:31:18.005
...some guy called Bhairo lived there.

01:31:18.342 --> 01:31:21.312
Since then the place
is known by this name.

01:31:21.379 --> 01:31:23.279
Do you have a life insurance?

01:31:24.882 --> 01:31:25.781
What?

01:31:25.917 --> 01:31:30.184
Because once you go in,
you can't come out? - Why?

01:31:30.888 --> 01:31:32.788
Dead bodies don't walk.

01:31:35.326 --> 01:31:39.422
There's a dispute between Prince
Vikram Singh and Ranveer Singh.

01:31:39.997 --> 01:31:42.466
Going there means inviting your death.

01:31:43.134 --> 01:31:44.329
If Ranveer Singh gets hold of you..

01:31:44.402 --> 01:31:45.801
...you can apologies
and save your life.

01:31:46.003 --> 01:31:50.668
But if Vikram Singh gets you,
then..you're dead for sure.

01:31:55.279 --> 01:31:57.475
Brother, here's Bhairo Virajna.

01:31:57.915 --> 01:31:59.974
By the way,
my advice is that you don't go in.

01:32:00.118 --> 01:32:01.176
Goodbye.

01:32:34.152 --> 01:32:35.916
'Angel in the form of human.'

01:32:40.458 --> 01:32:43.155
'What place is this?
- Bhairo sir's chamber.'

01:33:18.663 --> 01:33:20.495
Bhairo!

01:33:34.245 --> 01:33:35.735
Be patient.

01:33:43.621 --> 01:33:47.615
I've heard that Bhairo sir's
going to sculpt his best statue.

01:33:47.725 --> 01:33:51.059
We all know that,
one keeps the statue of Lord..

01:33:51.128 --> 01:33:53.654
...in front of the main entrance.

01:33:53.731 --> 01:33:55.096
Tomorrow is a no-moon night.

01:33:55.733 --> 01:33:57.701
We need to see why Bhairo sir..

01:33:57.768 --> 01:34:00.738
...wants to establish Leela's
statue at his main entrance?

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:03.036
Leela.

01:34:04.508 --> 01:34:05.202
Come on.

01:34:05.643 --> 01:34:06.974
Leela.. - It'll be fine.

01:34:08.045 --> 01:34:10.912
Look..my statue.

01:34:13.918 --> 01:34:16.717
Leela..the entire village
will see your statue tomorrow.

01:34:16.787 --> 01:34:18.152
They will all be so happy.

01:34:18.623 --> 01:34:20.250
I don't care about the villagers..

01:34:21.559 --> 01:34:22.651
...only you.

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:25.952
Shravan, you wanted
my statue to be sculpted.

01:34:26.964 --> 01:34:31.800
So I want you to see it first.

01:34:33.804 --> 01:34:34.999
I wish that too.

01:34:35.139 --> 01:34:36.664
So, don't suppress your desire.

01:34:36.908 --> 01:34:38.774
Come with me.
- Leela, you don't understand.

01:34:38.843 --> 01:34:39.776
Don't be crazy.

01:34:40.144 --> 01:34:42.340
Leela, Bhairo sir sculpted
that statue himself.

01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:45.342
Don't deprive him of his right.

01:34:45.583 --> 01:34:47.608
But only you have a right on me.

01:34:47.818 --> 01:34:48.842
Only you!

01:34:51.055 --> 01:34:52.614
Come on. - Leela.

01:34:52.857 --> 01:34:54.120
Leela..listen.

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:56.989
Leela.. - Let go.

01:34:57.161 --> 01:34:59.027
Leela..listen to me.

01:34:59.196 --> 01:35:00.322
Have you gone crazy?

01:35:01.032 --> 01:35:02.727
Leela.. - Let me go.

01:35:03.167 --> 01:35:03.998
Leela.

01:35:09.407 --> 01:35:11.375
Bhairo sir..

01:35:11.842 --> 01:35:13.105
Bhairo sir..l..

01:35:14.078 --> 01:35:18.447
She brought me here.
- Yes, Bhairo sir.

01:35:21.452 --> 01:35:24.114
With these hands I taught to sculpt.

01:35:25.656 --> 01:35:27.784
"But now I'll use them to punish you.

01:35:29.627 --> 01:35:30.423
Shravan.

01:35:31.829 --> 01:35:33.388
Leela belongs to me.

01:35:33.864 --> 01:35:36.561
Her statue, her body..

01:35:37.635 --> 01:35:40.468
...her complexion, beauty, youth, soul.

01:35:40.571 --> 01:35:42.096
They all belong to me.

01:35:43.107 --> 01:35:44.131
Only me.

01:35:45.509 --> 01:35:48.479
How dare you.. - Bhairo!

01:35:52.817 --> 01:35:55.843
How dare you raise
your hands on my Shravan?

01:35:56.587 --> 01:35:58.555
He's my husband!

01:35:59.190 --> 01:36:02.888
I will not spare anyone
who dares to touch him.

01:36:04.862 --> 01:36:07.024
I came here are your inspiration.

01:36:07.698 --> 01:36:10.998
But you thought I was your wife.

01:36:12.837 --> 01:36:14.931
Leela..belongs to Shravan.

01:36:15.172 --> 01:36:16.606
Only Shravan.

01:36:18.776 --> 01:36:20.210
Let's go. Come on.

01:36:23.647 --> 01:36:25.638
Leela.. - Let's go. Come on.

01:36:34.425 --> 01:36:35.893
Shravan. - Leela, move aside.

01:36:38.796 --> 01:36:41.060
No Bhairo. - Move aside.

01:37:16.867 --> 01:37:17.993
Leela!

01:37:23.507 --> 01:37:24.474
Come on.

01:37:25.943 --> 01:37:27.433
Shravan.

01:37:37.354 --> 01:37:39.015
Look. Look.

01:37:39.657 --> 01:37:41.853
I respected you like Goddess.

01:37:42.693 --> 01:37:44.092
Wanted to give you a high place.

01:37:44.161 --> 01:37:47.028
But you..lost all respect in my eyes.

01:37:47.865 --> 01:37:50.960
Your love, made me see
the highest peak of my an.

01:37:51.735 --> 01:37:53.100
But now..

01:37:54.472 --> 01:37:57.066
I'll show you the
depths of my hatred!

01:37:58.109 --> 01:37:59.042
Come on.

01:38:02.146 --> 01:38:03.375
Go!

01:38:21.832 --> 01:38:23.163
Catch him.

01:38:23.934 --> 01:38:25.595
Who are you?

01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:26.932
Let me go.

01:38:30.608 --> 01:38:34.977
Stand up, man. Don't just lie there.

01:38:37.882 --> 01:38:40.249
Who are you? - Karan.

01:38:47.024 --> 01:38:49.959
Lower your eyes while talking to me.

01:38:50.194 --> 01:38:52.060
Or else I'll gouge them out.

01:38:52.296 --> 01:38:53.320
Who are you?

01:38:54.064 --> 01:38:55.327
And what are you doing here?

01:38:56.133 --> 01:38:57.897
I liked the place, so I came in.

01:38:58.135 --> 01:39:03.733
RascaLif you like some girl,
will you barge in her home too?

01:39:05.376 --> 01:39:06.969
What are you doing in Jaisalmer?

01:39:07.077 --> 01:39:11.947
I have a friend. Ranveer Singh.

01:39:13.083 --> 01:39:14.175
Ranveer Singh?

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:17.810
You're Ranveer Singh's friend.

01:39:17.888 --> 01:39:20.653
You were spying on me? - No, Vikram.

01:39:20.891 --> 01:39:21.983
Don't beat him here.

01:39:22.226 --> 01:39:23.853
Take him to Ranveer Singh's manor.

01:39:24.094 --> 01:39:25.994
Absolutely right, brother Samar.

01:39:26.363 --> 01:39:29.264
And then I'll also get
a glimpse of that London girl.

01:39:29.833 --> 01:39:32.063
Vikram, she's your sister-in-law.

01:39:32.269 --> 01:39:34.795
I don't have any
ill intentions for her.

01:39:34.905 --> 01:39:38.341
All I want is a little
space near her feet.

01:39:39.710 --> 01:39:42.111
I'll show you my hospitality
at your friend's place.

01:39:42.179 --> 01:39:42.941
Come on.

01:39:48.285 --> 01:39:49.616
Ranveer!

01:39:50.187 --> 01:39:51.814
Ranveer Singh!

01:39:54.792 --> 01:39:56.157
What happened, brother Vikram?

01:40:20.050 --> 01:40:22.781
I've a gift for you.

01:40:23.721 --> 01:40:27.658
Your friend was taking
a stroll around Bhairo Virajna.

01:40:28.192 --> 01:40:32.527
Didn't you explain him,
that the place is prohibited?

01:40:33.163 --> 01:40:35.598
One only warns his friends.

01:40:36.066 --> 01:40:38.125
I never saw him before today.

01:40:39.637 --> 01:40:40.695
What?

01:40:42.206 --> 01:40:46.268
He's not your friend?
- No. I don't know him.

01:40:46.877 --> 01:40:51.713
You dare lie to Vikram!
You dare lie to Vikram!

01:40:54.318 --> 01:40:56.753
Bhairo Virajna isn't
your father's property!

01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:59.321
Why did you go to Bhairo Virajna?
- Ranveer, what's going on here?

01:40:59.723 --> 01:41:01.691
Tell me.

01:41:02.226 --> 01:41:04.718
Tell me.

01:41:06.130 --> 01:41:06.926
Tell me.

01:41:06.997 --> 01:41:07.862
Stop it!

01:42:04.521 --> 01:42:06.819
You? - Yes.

01:42:09.193 --> 01:42:10.752
You recognized me?

01:42:11.128 --> 01:42:12.061
Yes.

01:42:14.064 --> 01:42:15.054
Karan, right?

01:42:20.537 --> 01:42:24.098
Ranveer, I thought he's your friend.

01:42:25.209 --> 01:42:28.804
But he turned out
to be your wife's buddy.

01:42:31.548 --> 01:42:32.140
Yes.

01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:35.749
He's my friend Radhika's brother.

01:42:37.588 --> 01:42:38.851
Now you can go.

01:42:39.456 --> 01:42:41.652
See you, sister-in-law.

01:42:44.795 --> 01:42:47.059
You've really lucky!

01:42:48.031 --> 01:42:48.930
Let's go.

01:42:51.602 --> 01:42:52.569
Meera.

01:42:53.170 --> 01:42:54.194
Shall we go in?

01:42:55.839 --> 01:42:56.738
Shall we?

01:42:58.509 --> 01:42:59.635
Come on.

01:43:01.678 --> 01:43:02.474
Let's go.

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:11.081
Relax.

01:43:13.290 --> 01:43:15.782
How are you feeling now?
- Much better.

01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:18.685
A Rajpufs used you as a punching bag.

01:43:19.096 --> 01:43:20.962
Only Rum can cure this pain.

01:43:22.166 --> 01:43:22.997
Thanks.

01:43:23.901 --> 01:43:25.300
What were you doing in Bhairo Virajna?

01:43:34.344 --> 01:43:36.108
I'm making a music
album on Rajasthani music.

01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:38.815
So I went there looking for something.

01:43:39.116 --> 01:43:41.380
I think you're looking
for something special.

01:43:48.459 --> 01:43:49.449
Excuse me.

01:43:49.893 --> 01:43:50.689
Yes, Mr. Puneet.

01:43:50.761 --> 01:43:52.320
Where are you?
We are waiting for you?

01:43:52.429 --> 01:43:54.090
I'm on my way, sir. - Okay, come.

01:43:54.698 --> 01:43:55.722
0K8'!-

01:43:56.633 --> 01:43:57.725
Excuse me. I've to go.

01:43:57.801 --> 01:43:58.927
I'll see you later.

01:44:04.508 --> 01:44:07.341
Hi, Radhika, Meera here.

01:44:07.411 --> 01:44:08.845
Hi, Meera, how are you?

01:44:08.912 --> 01:44:11.142
I've a good news for you.

01:44:11.748 --> 01:44:13.739
Good news, so soon! Wow!

01:44:13.817 --> 01:44:16.582
Shut up, I didn't mean that.

01:44:16.854 --> 01:44:18.948
So? - Your brother Karan is here.

01:44:19.957 --> 01:44:20.788
Karan?

01:44:21.058 --> 01:44:22.992
Here, talk to her. It's Rads.

01:44:23.093 --> 01:44:23.787
Yeah!

01:44:25.496 --> 01:44:26.486
Hi, Radhika.

01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:28.559
What are you doing in Jaisalmer?

01:44:28.899 --> 01:44:30.128
Fate brought me here.

01:44:30.734 --> 01:44:33.101
Amazing..couldn't
you come a bit earlier.

01:44:33.504 --> 01:44:34.630
Even I would've met you.

01:44:34.805 --> 01:44:36.864
Life had come to
a standstill back then.

01:44:40.410 --> 01:44:41.969
And when it caught up pace.

01:44:42.846 --> 01:44:45.907
...l found myself in front of Meera.

01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:49.551
You're sounding like
a philosopher now.

01:44:50.187 --> 01:44:51.586
I'm a bit confused.

01:44:52.723 --> 01:44:53.952
How did Meera recognize me?

01:44:54.091 --> 01:44:55.081
What do you mean by how?

01:44:55.425 --> 01:44:56.984
She has a very sharp memory.

01:44:57.094 --> 01:44:59.426
I showed her your photo once.

01:44:59.796 --> 01:45:01.127
Karan, now I have to go.

01:45:01.465 --> 01:45:03.433
But if you need any1hing,
feel free to ask Meera.

01:45:03.634 --> 01:45:05.625
Okay? - Yeah, bye.

01:45:05.836 --> 01:45:07.167
Take care, bye.

01:45:09.006 --> 01:45:09.564
Thanks.

01:45:09.673 --> 01:45:10.868
Every1hing okay? - Yeah.

01:45:12.476 --> 01:45:15.935
By the way,
you didn't attend my wedding.

01:45:16.079 --> 01:45:17.478
And now you're suddenly here.

01:45:18.682 --> 01:45:21.208
Actually,
I came here looking for someone.

01:45:22.586 --> 01:45:24.748
Some chapters from my
past are still incomplete.

01:45:26.623 --> 01:45:27.590
...and I'm here to complete them.

01:45:27.724 --> 01:45:29.658
But..aren't you a musician?

01:45:30.427 --> 01:45:34.762
Yes. - So..what's all this
about books..pages..etcetera..

01:45:38.669 --> 01:45:39.864
Meera..

01:45:41.471 --> 01:45:42.529
How do I tell you?

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:44.599
L.. - Forget it.

01:45:44.741 --> 01:45:47.369
Eat your food and
take some rest. Okay?

01:45:48.679 --> 01:45:53.048
And then we'll talk about
your..incomplete chapters, later..

01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.976
Okay?

01:45:54.985 --> 01:45:56.009
0K8'!-

01:46:02.993 --> 01:46:04.927
'How will destiny come full circle?'

01:46:06.964 --> 01:46:07.897
'I don't know.'

01:46:07.965 --> 01:46:09.865
'How will I get to that point?'

01:46:10.968 --> 01:46:13.437
'I wonder if Meera remembers any1hing,
like I do.'

01:46:14.905 --> 01:46:18.739
'I still don't know who's Bhairo,
where he is.'

01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:28.984
'I'll have to talk to Meera.'

01:47:02.085 --> 01:47:05.020
Maan Singh..look..

01:47:05.155 --> 01:47:09.683
Actually, I can explain this.

01:47:09.793 --> 01:47:12.592
I didn't know that was Meera's room.

01:47:12.696 --> 01:47:15.825
Maan Singh, it's not like you think.

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:17.868
Please believe me.

01:47:18.035 --> 01:47:20.936
I was actually heading
towards the kitchen.

01:47:35.886 --> 01:47:37.650
Karan sir, get some rest.

01:47:38.021 --> 01:47:39.420
This happens with him every day.

01:47:39.756 --> 01:47:42.123
Maan Singh sir suffers
from sleep-walking.

01:48:02.045 --> 01:48:03.035
Leela!

01:48:09.553 --> 01:48:10.486
Yes?

01:48:10.687 --> 01:48:12.985
Come fast in breakfast.

01:48:13.223 --> 01:48:14.019
What?

01:48:14.091 --> 01:48:18.255
Brother, come down for breakfast.
- Coming.

01:48:21.498 --> 01:48:22.966
Leela!

01:49:11.982 --> 01:49:13.882
Good morning, Karan. - Good morning.

01:49:14.718 --> 01:49:15.776
Had a nice sleep?

01:49:18.388 --> 01:49:20.914
Actually, Leela.. - Not Leela.

01:49:21.191 --> 01:49:24.320
It's Meera Ranveer Singh.

01:49:26.129 --> 01:49:26.925
Meera.

01:49:29.232 --> 01:49:31.132
I don't know whether
I should tell you this or not.

01:49:32.035 --> 01:49:33.594
What happened?

01:49:35.138 --> 01:49:37.300
Recently I've been
getting some weird dreams.

01:49:37.941 --> 01:49:39.340
I see faces.

01:49:40.177 --> 01:49:41.667
I hear some names.

01:49:43.847 --> 01:49:46.145
I feel as if that
name's calling out to me.

01:49:50.854 --> 01:49:53.755
Has this ever happened
with you? - Yes.

01:49:54.324 --> 01:49:55.723
It happens with me often.

01:49:55.959 --> 01:49:58.860
Even l..can hear voices.

01:49:59.696 --> 01:50:02.757
But..l don't see anyone.

01:50:03.767 --> 01:50:05.166
How long has this been happening?

01:50:05.735 --> 01:50:06.725
Every time"

01:50:08.205 --> 01:50:11.175
...when I talk on the phone.

01:50:11.241 --> 01:50:12.231
Get it?

01:50:12.776 --> 01:50:14.676
Oh, come on, Meera, this is serious.

01:50:15.011 --> 01:50:18.208
The story that began 300
years ago in Bhairo Virajna..

01:50:18.715 --> 01:50:20.410
...l still see it in my dreams.

01:50:20.917 --> 01:50:22.248
And the strange pan is..

01:50:23.954 --> 01:50:24.853
What?

01:50:25.121 --> 01:50:26.452
I see you.

01:50:27.324 --> 01:50:29.053
And in the form of Leela.

01:50:30.293 --> 01:50:31.351
Oh really?

01:50:31.962 --> 01:50:34.192
Good morning. - Morning.

01:50:35.832 --> 01:50:36.731
Hi.

01:50:38.869 --> 01:50:41.167
So, Mr. Magician, how was your night?

01:50:41.671 --> 01:50:43.730
He's talking about some weird dreams.

01:50:44.708 --> 01:50:46.369
Dreams? What dreams?

01:50:46.977 --> 01:50:50.106
It's..it's just like that.

01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:51.272
Nothing serious.

01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:57.853
Sir.

01:51:08.899 --> 01:51:10.128
Sugar?

01:51:13.870 --> 01:51:15.065
Karan? - Yes?

01:51:15.171 --> 01:51:16.366
Sugar?

01:51:16.439 --> 01:51:17.429
Two.. - Okay.

01:51:22.512 --> 01:51:23.877
What happened, Ranveer?

01:51:24.347 --> 01:51:25.906
Tomorrow there's a veneration
of Vishwakarma in the village.

01:51:27.317 --> 01:51:28.910
We've been celebrating
this veneration.

01:51:28.985 --> 01:51:30.350
...in a grand way
for hundreds of years.

01:51:30.787 --> 01:51:33.256
And this year the villagers
want you to attend it too.

01:51:33.757 --> 01:51:34.781
How sweet.

01:51:35.325 --> 01:51:36.520
Why don't you join us too?

01:52:32.682 --> 01:52:34.116
I want to talk to you.

01:52:35.085 --> 01:52:37.383
What? - I want to talk to you.

01:52:38.722 --> 01:52:40.622
Come with me. Come.

01:52:46.062 --> 01:52:48.827
Leela.. - My name is Meera!

01:52:48.898 --> 01:52:50.024
Not Leela.

01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:51.158
In this lifetime.

01:52:51.401 --> 01:52:53.495
But in your previous birth,
you were Leela.

01:52:53.636 --> 01:52:54.660
And I was Shravan.

01:52:54.738 --> 01:52:57.833
And that Ranveer, he was Bhairo.

01:52:58.508 --> 01:52:59.907
Bhairo? - Yes.

01:53:00.577 --> 01:53:02.102
And he also sculpted a statue of you.

01:53:05.982 --> 01:53:06.778
Look.

01:53:07.417 --> 01:53:08.145
Leela.

01:53:09.119 --> 01:53:10.416
That story began on this day..

01:53:10.487 --> 01:53:12.012
“With the veneration of Vishwakarma..

01:53:12.088 --> 01:53:13.988
...where he saw you for the first time.

01:53:14.057 --> 01:53:16.424
And in this lifetime,
he wants to do the same thing.

01:53:16.493 --> 01:53:17.551
Shut up, Karan.

01:53:18.762 --> 01:53:22.892
I respect you because
you're Radhika's brother.

01:53:23.166 --> 01:53:25.760
But I don't know
what you want to prove..

01:53:26.169 --> 01:53:28.069
...by telling me this weird story.

01:53:28.471 --> 01:53:30.838
Meera..try to understand.

01:53:31.174 --> 01:53:34.041
Coming here, getting to Bhairo
Virajna is not a coincidence.

01:53:34.210 --> 01:53:37.180
I've connected every link up to here,
only for you. - Enough!

01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:39.478
I am married!

01:53:39.749 --> 01:53:41.114
You've crossed the line!

01:53:41.451 --> 01:53:43.044
Go away!

01:54:00.303 --> 01:54:01.361
I did it.

01:54:01.438 --> 01:54:03.065
I hit the jackpot.

01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:07.571
You lit a torch for
me in this dark cave.

01:54:07.644 --> 01:54:07.974
Your highness.

01:54:08.044 --> 01:54:10.979
And its light Will
reach your home too.

01:54:11.581 --> 01:54:12.309
Thank you.

01:54:12.382 --> 01:54:14.817
For now..take this small token.

01:54:15.618 --> 01:54:17.484
Thank you, Vikram sir.

01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:23.354
By the way,
where's that long lost-traveller now?

01:54:23.493 --> 01:54:26.326
There's a musical program
at the Prince's manor.

01:54:26.429 --> 01:54:27.988
Come, brother Samar.

01:54:28.064 --> 01:54:30.692
Let's go and pay our respects.

01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:35.636
Karan..you can sing any song you like.

01:54:36.306 --> 01:54:41.472
But to me, you'll be singing
the melody I want to hear.

01:54:42.512 --> 01:54:49.748
"Beloved.. My beloved."

01:54:49.853 --> 01:54:55.951
"Come home this time."

01:54:56.659 --> 01:55:05.500
"Dwell in my eyes.."

01:55:08.004 --> 01:55:13.704
"And show me your beautiful face."

01:55:14.811 --> 01:55:21.478
"My hean yearns."

01:55:22.886 --> 01:55:28.586
"My hean yearns without you."

01:55:29.425 --> 01:55:37.765
"Don't go away again."

01:55:39.836 --> 01:55:45.673
"My fair beloved..

01:55:46.743 --> 01:55:56.983
...come back to my land."

01:56:18.675 --> 01:56:21.838
"My nights are restless."

01:56:21.911 --> 01:56:24.608
"The days torment me as well."

01:56:24.681 --> 01:56:30.051
"Come back to me..beloved."

01:56:30.286 --> 01:56:35.554
"l've yet to finish..
telling that imponant story."

01:56:35.625 --> 01:56:41.029
"Come back..and listen to me, beloved."

01:56:41.097 --> 01:56:46.467
"Without you..my heart restless."

01:56:46.536 --> 01:56:48.834
"Without you.."

01:56:49.105 --> 01:56:51.904
"Come back to me, beloved."

01:56:51.975 --> 01:56:57.880
"Without you..my heart restless."

01:57:09.592 --> 01:57:14.860
"The weathers are not the same."

01:57:15.031 --> 01:57:20.060
"Even the rains feel different."

01:57:20.603 --> 01:57:25.700
"The weathers are not the same."

01:57:26.042 --> 01:57:30.536
"Even the rains feel different."

01:57:30.613 --> 01:57:36.985
"Like the dried river..

01:57:37.053 --> 01:57:41.581
...my destiny calls
out to you..beloved."

01:57:41.658 --> 01:57:46.789
"Without you..my heart restless."

01:57:46.863 --> 01:57:49.628
"Without you.."

01:57:49.699 --> 01:57:52.430
"Come back to me, beloved."

01:57:52.502 --> 01:57:57.804
"Without you..my heart restless."

01:57:57.874 --> 01:58:00.434
"Without you.."

01:58:00.977 --> 01:58:03.105
"Without you.."

01:58:03.613 --> 01:58:05.411
"Without you.."

01:58:48.791 --> 01:58:55.128
"O drummer, your drums are thumping,"

01:58:55.198 --> 01:58:58.361
"The drums are thumping."

01:58:58.434 --> 01:59:04.931
"O drummer, your drums are thumping,"

01:59:05.007 --> 01:59:08.170
"The drums are thumping."

01:59:08.244 --> 01:59:14.741
"O drummer, your drums are thumping,"

01:59:14.817 --> 01:59:17.980
"The drums are thumping."

01:59:18.054 --> 01:59:21.183
"The drums are thumping."

01:59:21.257 --> 01:59:25.023
"The drums are thumping."

01:59:28.097 --> 01:59:29.223
Meera!

01:59:34.704 --> 01:59:35.432
What happened?

01:59:35.738 --> 01:59:36.466
Meera!

01:59:45.214 --> 01:59:46.147
Thank you, doctor. - It's okay.

01:59:46.215 --> 01:59:46.977
Come.

01:59:49.419 --> 01:59:51.854
She shouldn't have stopped
her medication so abruptly.

01:59:51.921 --> 01:59:53.719
Anyway, she's fine.

01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:56.157
I'll prescribe some medicines.
- No, doctor.

01:59:56.692 --> 01:59:58.387
The reason behind
her illness is different.

01:59:59.729 --> 02:00:01.788
I'll take Meera back to London soon.

02:00:02.765 --> 02:00:03.994
Goodnight doctor. - Goodnight.

02:00:10.506 --> 02:00:12.133
Ranveer Singh!

02:00:23.052 --> 02:00:24.679
I want to talk to Meera.

02:00:24.954 --> 02:00:26.444
Listen to me carefully.

02:00:27.089 --> 02:00:29.490
Don't fuel my hatred.

02:00:29.892 --> 02:00:34.227
If anything happens to Meera,
you'll face my wrath.

02:00:34.664 --> 02:00:37.895
No one ever got love for hatred.

02:00:38.568 --> 02:00:41.833
Don't try to take undue
advantage of Rajpufs love, Karan.

02:00:42.171 --> 02:00:43.570
If his hatred awakens.

02:00:43.639 --> 02:00:45.971
...you will wish that you were dead.

02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:48.807
I want to talk to Meera.

02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:55.210
If I didn't care about Radhika,
you would've been long dead.

02:00:57.286 --> 02:01:01.484
Look, the Jaisalmer border
ends at 25 kilometers.

02:01:02.859 --> 02:01:04.759
I'll give you 20 minutes.

02:01:05.928 --> 02:01:08.124
If I still see you around..

02:01:08.264 --> 02:01:10.961
...then, your search
will end with your death.

02:01:26.849 --> 02:01:30.251
If you kill him,
how will I find the statue?

02:01:30.853 --> 02:01:32.685
Come sister-in-law. - Leave me.

02:01:32.822 --> 02:01:35.757
And the heroine should
be in the villain's clutches.

02:01:42.231 --> 02:01:43.221
Shall we go?

02:01:50.209 --> 02:01:51.699
Where's the statue?

02:01:59.652 --> 02:02:02.713
I don't even remember the name.

02:02:02.855 --> 02:02:04.789
...of the girl I was with last night.

02:02:05.157 --> 02:02:08.388
And you..remember your previous birth.

02:02:16.268 --> 02:02:18.669
So..where's the statue?

02:02:19.605 --> 02:02:20.629
I don't know.

02:02:21.874 --> 02:02:23.808
You really don't know
where the statue is.

02:02:24.276 --> 02:02:25.471
'Leela.'

02:02:25.544 --> 02:02:27.273
'I don't want to get any statue made.'

02:02:27.446 --> 02:02:28.845
I said I don't know.

02:02:31.884 --> 02:02:33.511
'I will behead you.'

02:02:35.688 --> 02:02:38.316
'My name's Leela.'

02:02:40.926 --> 02:02:42.894
'Angel in the form of human.'

02:02:44.797 --> 02:02:46.492
'I don't want a statue.'

02:02:46.565 --> 02:02:49.899
'We can get married.. - Marriage!'

02:02:51.704 --> 02:02:52.762
'Bhairo!'

02:02:53.739 --> 02:02:54.706
Move aside.

02:02:58.877 --> 02:03:01.471
'I'll show the depths of my hatred.'

02:03:01.747 --> 02:03:02.771
'sol.

02:03:17.630 --> 02:03:19.325
'Look..my statue.'

02:03:23.802 --> 02:03:25.236
The statue was there.

02:03:39.218 --> 02:03:45.487
Sister-in-law..why do you
want to save him every time?

02:03:46.425 --> 02:03:47.551
Vikram.

02:03:48.227 --> 02:03:49.285
Move.

02:03:50.396 --> 02:03:50.760
Vikram sir.

02:03:50.829 --> 02:03:51.660
Stop!

02:03:56.735 --> 02:04:00.797
Your statue..is behind that wall!

02:04:03.809 --> 02:04:05.004
Go get it.

02:04:05.911 --> 02:04:08.505
RascaLyou could've told me before.

02:04:08.847 --> 02:04:10.212
It would've saved you the thrashing.

02:04:10.449 --> 02:04:11.473
Break down that wall.

02:04:13.352 --> 02:04:13.910
Come.

02:04:13.986 --> 02:04:15.818
Come fast.

02:04:16.922 --> 02:04:18.754
Break this wall.

02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:21.849
Fast.

02:04:22.027 --> 02:04:23.290
Break from here.

02:04:23.462 --> 02:04:25.521
You finally believe me..

02:04:26.632 --> 02:04:28.327
...that I was telling the truth.

02:04:28.767 --> 02:04:30.428
Don't you have strength in those arms.

02:04:32.404 --> 02:04:33.337
For 300 years..l've been living..

02:04:33.405 --> 02:04:35.533
“With the wounds inflicted by Bhairo.

02:04:35.874 --> 02:04:40.607
But maybe..the Lord's
finally taken mercy on me.

02:04:59.431 --> 02:05:01.490
Found it. I found it.

02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:04.064
I found the statue.

02:05:08.607 --> 02:05:10.598
I found the statue.

02:05:11.710 --> 02:05:12.905
Vikram Singh!

02:05:23.522 --> 02:05:24.853
Vikram!

02:05:42.741 --> 02:05:44.004
Beat him!

02:06:12.771 --> 02:06:13.704
Beat him!

02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:45.068
Ranveer!

02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:51.541
You severed all the blood
ties by shedding blood.

02:06:52.344 --> 02:06:55.314
And also invited your
death by touching my Meera.

02:06:57.115 --> 02:07:01.279
Now..Bhairo Virajna
belongs only to me.

02:07:02.688 --> 02:07:04.850
Casedismissed!

02:07:38.657 --> 02:07:42.594
This time..history won't be repeated.

02:07:43.295 --> 02:07:46.424
In this life time..Bhairo will die.

02:07:46.765 --> 02:07:49.894
Two lovers..won't be separated.

02:07:51.904 --> 02:07:53.338
L..- Karan!

02:07:55.607 --> 02:07:58.770
How dare you touch Ranveer!

02:07:59.177 --> 02:08:00.576
He's my husband.

02:08:03.715 --> 02:08:07.583
If you touch him,
Meera won't spare you!

02:08:22.401 --> 02:08:23.698
Shravan and Leela were dead.

02:08:27.639 --> 02:08:30.768
And the one who hid that
statue behind the wall..

02:08:30.842 --> 02:08:33.140
...would know this fact.

02:08:33.478 --> 02:08:34.536
That's the truth, Karan.

02:09:04.910 --> 02:09:06.605
That's the truth, Karan.

02:09:08.180 --> 02:09:09.170
You are Bhairo.

02:09:34.039 --> 02:09:35.063
Ranveer.

02:09:36.775 --> 02:09:38.436
How do you know all this?

02:09:39.378 --> 02:09:41.870
Because 300 years ago,
we died together.

02:09:44.583 --> 02:09:45.846
Shravan?

02:09:59.498 --> 02:10:01.489
Meera didn't remember anything
about her previous life.

02:10:03.068 --> 02:10:05.503
Nor did I try to remind her.

02:10:07.606 --> 02:10:09.574
Nature played a strange trick on us.

02:10:10.509 --> 02:10:11.806
Meera was born with the same face..

02:10:11.877 --> 02:10:13.675
"But gave us different faces.

02:10:17.115 --> 02:10:19.607
'Now I'll use them to punish you.'

02:10:31.730 --> 02:10:34.028
300 years ago you committed the crime.

02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:37.261
And so you were being punished.

02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:42.866
'Since I moved in this house..'

02:10:42.941 --> 02:10:44.431
'..l've been seeing weird dreams.'

02:10:44.509 --> 02:10:46.238
'You didn't move in that house alone.'

02:10:46.311 --> 02:10:49.838
'Some unwanted memories
also entered that home with you.'

02:11:03.295 --> 02:11:06.162
I could've killed
you and taken my revenge.

02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:09.861
But fate had already
taken its revenge.

02:11:12.237 --> 02:11:14.797
And so, I felt sympathetic
instead of hatred.

02:11:17.876 --> 02:11:21.107
You are Bhairo, not Shravan, Karan.

02:11:22.514 --> 02:11:25.449
You didn't endure that injustice,
you're the one who caused it.

02:11:26.852 --> 02:11:29.514
You caused them so much pain..

02:11:29.654 --> 02:11:34.216
...that, you're not even
worthy of their hatred.

02:11:35.327 --> 02:11:37.796
Fate has brought you to this bend.

02:11:38.230 --> 02:11:39.755
...so that you could be punished.

02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:45.828
And you can wash off the stains
of their blood with your own blood.

02:11:49.174 --> 02:11:50.198
Karan!

02:12:00.352 --> 02:12:01.444
No, Karan!

02:12:12.764 --> 02:12:13.856
Let me go, Shravan.

02:12:13.932 --> 02:12:15.263
No, Karan!

02:12:15.867 --> 02:12:17.596
It's best for Bhairo to die.

02:12:17.869 --> 02:12:19.234
You're wrong, Karan.

02:12:20.605 --> 02:12:22.733
You're not Bhairo, nor am I Shravan.

02:12:23.308 --> 02:12:24.173
And if you end your life like this.

02:12:24.242 --> 02:12:27.234
...you won't gain salvation,
nor repentance.

02:12:27.379 --> 02:12:29.473
No my.. - No, Karan.

02:12:29.548 --> 02:12:33.178
Bhairo should've died, not Karan.

02:12:33.552 --> 02:12:37.352
Our next binh is not
only for revenge or repentance.

02:12:38.924 --> 02:12:43.623
The Lord gives us an opponunity
to apologies and pardon.

02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:46.791
We forgive you for killing us.

02:12:47.199 --> 02:12:47.961
Yes, Karan.

02:12:48.867 --> 02:12:50.835
Come.

02:12:51.570 --> 02:12:52.560
Yes Karan.

02:13:12.057 --> 02:13:12.956
Rajiv.

02:13:13.458 --> 02:13:14.050
Hey, Rajiv.

02:13:14.359 --> 02:13:15.383
What are you listening?

02:13:15.527 --> 02:13:18.326
It's the remix of 'Tere Bin'.
It's fantastic.

02:13:18.496 --> 02:13:19.861
It'll be a platinum hit, for sure.

02:13:21.266 --> 02:13:22.324
Look.

02:13:23.268 --> 02:13:24.394
See that.

02:13:25.370 --> 02:13:27.634
The song that reminded me of my past.

02:13:29.407 --> 02:13:31.432
"Also fulfilled all
my dreams of this lifetime.

02:13:33.545 --> 02:13:34.637
Let me hear it too.

02:13:37.048 --> 02:13:38.072
Hey bro.. - Yeah!

02:13:38.516 --> 02:13:40.006
Will be screaming "Leela" again?

02:13:42.854 --> 02:13:44.015
Let's go.

02:13:44.456 --> 02:13:46.288
Leela!

02:13:57.102 --> 02:14:01.300
"My nights are restless."

02:14:01.373 --> 02:14:04.707
"The days torment me as well."

02:14:04.776 --> 02:14:11.876
"Come back to me..beloved."

02:14:11.950 --> 02:14:18.947
"l've yet to finish..telling
that imponant story."

02:14:19.024 --> 02:14:25.953
"Come back..and listen to me,
beloved."

02:14:26.031 --> 02:14:32.801
"Without you..my heart restless."

02:14:33.004 --> 02:14:36.099
"Without you.."

02:14:36.608 --> 02:14:40.044
"Come back to me, beloved."

02:14:40.111 --> 02:14:48.781
"Without you..my heart restless."

02:15:08.707 --> 02:15:15.579
"Without you..my heart restless."

02:15:15.647 --> 02:15:18.776
"Without you.."

02:15:19.117 --> 02:15:22.678
"Come back to me, beloved."

02:15:22.754 --> 02:15:31.595
"Without you..my heart restless."
