WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.038
GOSH, THEIR GOALIE
GOT LUCKY, DAD.

00:04.072 --> 00:06.307
YEAH, THE GOALIE WAS LUCKY YOU
KEPT KICKING IT RIGHT TO HER.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.808
I THINK THE LAST TIME
YOU KICKED TO HER,

00:07.841 --> 00:09.543
SHE JUST WENT, "HEY, THANKS!"
(Vanessa sighs)

00:09.577 --> 00:12.246
WILL YOU TWO PLEASE
STOP ARGUING?

00:12.280 --> 00:13.981
AND WHAT ABOUT THE GIRL
THAT STOLE THE BALL FROM YOU?

00:14.014 --> 00:16.050
WHY IS SHE STILL WALKING?
(door closes)

00:16.084 --> 00:18.652
"GREAT GAME, HONEY."
"HEY, THANKS, DAD."

00:18.686 --> 00:21.489
IT'S CALLED BEING NICE,
DAMN IT!

00:21.522 --> 00:22.923
LISTEN, YOU'RE PLAYING
AT A HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.558
YOU GOTTA PUNCH UP
YOUR GAME A LITTLE BIT.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.594
OKAY. IF YOU THINK YOU CAN
DO SO MUCH BETTER,

00:26.627 --> 00:28.262
THEN WHY DON'T YOU JUST
DRESS UP LIKE A TEENAGE GIRL

00:28.296 --> 00:29.730
AND JOIN THE TEAM?

00:29.763 --> 00:32.100
IF I TOOK THE TROUBLE TO
DRESS UP LIKE A TEENAGE GIRL,

00:32.133 --> 00:34.302
I'M GOIN' OUT!
(snapping fingers)

00:36.070 --> 00:38.106
YOU SHOT SOME VIDEO
OF THAT GAME.
I DID. YEAH.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.873
WOULD YOU HOOK UP
THE TV, PLEASE?
OKAY.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.442
I WANT TO SEE THAT LAST
PENALTY KICK.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.444
(sighs)
REALLY SORRY
I MISSED THE GAME.

00:43.477 --> 00:46.114
(groans) WHY COULDN'T EVE
HAVE BEEN A TOTAL KLUTZ

00:46.147 --> 00:48.416
LIKE YOU AND MANDY?

00:48.449 --> 00:50.284
I LIKE TO THINK WE ALL
HAVE OUR OWN STRENGTHS.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.619
YOU KNOW, LIKE FOR INSTANCE,

00:51.652 --> 00:52.953
MANDY HAS HER KEEN
FASHION SENSE,

00:52.986 --> 00:56.390
AND I... AM FERTILE.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.092
(clicking)
I JUST HATE HOW PEOPLE
GET SO UPSET

00:58.126 --> 00:59.627
ABOUT SOCCER AROUND HERE.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.796
OH, NO, THE GAME OF FOOTBALL
STIRS UP A LOT OF PASSION.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.733
MY FATHER USED TO PUT A LOT
OF PRESSURE ON ME WHEN I PLAYED.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.068
I SPIT ON HIS GRAVE.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.540
BUT I'M SURE EVE WON'T HOLD IT
AGAINST MR. MIKE.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.608
OKAY.

01:14.642 --> 01:16.944
(indistinct shouting)

01:16.977 --> 01:19.613
(foreign accent)
NICE! NICE! GOOD JOB!

01:19.647 --> 01:21.149
WHO IS THAT?

01:23.251 --> 01:26.287
THAT IS THE NEW
ASSISTANT COACH, OCTAVIO.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.490
HE'S KIND OF A BABE.
YEAH.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.392
MOM?
HMM?

01:31.425 --> 01:32.893
NOT THAT I'M COMPLAINING,
BUT, UM...

01:32.926 --> 01:34.462
(clicks tongue)
DID YOU GET ANYTHING

01:34.495 --> 01:36.797
BESIDES THIS GUY
IN HIS SHORTS?
HUH? OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.299
YEAH. UM...

01:38.332 --> 01:40.768
UH...

01:43.871 --> 01:46.607
(exhales)
GOD, NO, THAT'S--THAT'S
PRETTY--PRETTY MUCH IT.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.941
YEAH.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.943
HEY, DID YOU CUE THAT UP, HONEY?
WHERE'S THE GAME?

01:49.977 --> 01:51.612
UH, HONEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:51.645 --> 01:53.481
UH, UH, I THINK SOMETHING'S
WRONG WITH MY PHONE.
WHAT?

01:53.514 --> 01:55.649
I-IT CAME OUT ALL GRAINY.
IT WAS GRAINY, RIGHT, GIRLS?
YEAH.

01:55.683 --> 01:57.618
GRAINY.
OH, VERY GRAINY.
NOTHING TO SEE.

01:57.651 --> 01:58.952
NOTHING BUT GRAINY,
GRAINY, GRAINY.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.455
OKAY. HE GETS IT, BLANCA.
IT'S GRAINY.

02:01.489 --> 02:02.956
HONEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOUR PHONE?

02:02.990 --> 02:05.426
I DON'T KNOW, MIKE.
I'M NOT A SCIENTIST.

02:05.459 --> 02:09.963
YOU HAVE A PhD IN GEOLOGY.
YOU IN FACT ARE A SCIENTIST.

02:09.997 --> 02:13.801
YOU KNOW WHAT? I JUST--
I WISH YOU'D LET UP ON EVE.
I KNOW.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.303
YEAH.
SHE CAN PLAY
BETTER THAN THAT, YOU KNOW?

02:15.336 --> 02:17.505
SHE'S JUST NOT LISTENING
TO ME ANYMORE.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.373
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T BE
HER COACH ANYMORE.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.008
WHAT ABOUT THAT
NEW ASSISTANT COACH?

02:21.041 --> 02:24.612
THAT, UH, UH, UM, UM...
OKTOBERFEST, OR, UH...

02:24.645 --> 02:26.314
YOUNG GUY.
OCTAVIO?

02:26.347 --> 02:29.183
YEAH, YEAH.
YEAH. HE SEEMS NICE.
WHY?

02:29.217 --> 02:32.019
HE DOES PRIVATE COACHING.
I COULD HIRE HIM TO COACH EVE,

02:32.052 --> 02:33.321
AND HE'LL COME
RIGHT TO THE HOUSE.

02:33.354 --> 02:36.290
UH... GONNA HAVE--
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

02:36.324 --> 02:38.058
YOU THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA?

02:38.091 --> 02:39.393
I JUST WANT TO THINK
ABOUT IT, MIKE.

02:39.427 --> 02:40.961
THINK ABOUT IT.
THAT'S ALL.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.296
IF HE WAS ABLE TO TEACH HER
ANYTHING, YOU KNOW...
(sighs)

02:42.330 --> 02:43.797
SHE MIGHT GET A SCHOLARSHIP.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.133
SHE GETS A SCHOLARSHIP,
Y-YOU KNOW, I, UH...
(door opens)

02:46.166 --> 02:48.469
I COULD GET A BOAT.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.137
(chuckles) ALL RIGHT, WELL,
IF A PRIVATE COACH

02:50.170 --> 02:52.806
MEANS LESS OF YOU TWO ARGUING,
THEN--THEN I'M ALL FOR IT.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.308
PERFECT.
I'LL GIVE HIM A CALL.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.377
I GUESS HE DOES IT
FOR A LOT OF THE GIRLS.

02:58.279 --> 03:01.815
DOES IT
FOR A LOT OF THE MOMS, TOO.

03:01.849 --> 03:05.819
-- Captions by VITA --

03:05.853 --> 03:10.090
(sighs) I'VE BEEN
TEACHING EVE UP TILL NOW.

03:10.123 --> 03:11.592
YOU KNOW, I PLAYED FOOTBALL
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.995
THE OTHER FOOTBALL--THE KIND
PEOPLE REALLY CARE ABOUT.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.831
OH, YEAH. EXCEPT
FOR THE 6 BILLION PEOPLE

03:17.865 --> 03:20.434
WHO DON'T LIVE IN AMERICA.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.404
WE'RE LOSING DAYLIGHT, LADIES.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.274
CAN WE JUST KICK SOME BALLS?
PLEASE?

03:26.307 --> 03:28.108
HIS NAME'S OCTAVIO?

03:28.141 --> 03:31.245
THE OTHER MOMS
CALL HIM "THE BIG O."

03:31.279 --> 03:32.780
YOU KNOW WHY?

03:32.813 --> 03:34.282
YEAH. YEAH.

03:34.315 --> 03:37.251
BUT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE
MY MOTHER EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.119
HEY, WHAT DOES HE CHARGE
PER HOUR,

03:39.152 --> 03:41.755
AND DOES IT HAVE TO INVOLVE
SOCCER?

03:43.457 --> 03:46.260
MY DAD AND I USUALLY
WARM UP WITH SOME STRETCHING.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.796
OR WE CAN START WITH...
JUGGLING.

03:48.829 --> 03:52.933
OR SOME CLOSE-UP MAGIC
AND VENTRILOQUISM.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.602
UH, JUGGLING,
L-LIKE THIS.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.604
UH, I KNOW WHAT JUGGLING IS,
BUT WE GOTTA STRETCH.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.738
YOU GOTTA...

04:02.343 --> 04:03.611
WELL, THAT'LL COME IN HANDY

04:03.644 --> 04:05.813
IF SHE EVER WANTS TO BE
A TRAINED SEAL.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.621
BLANCA, I THOUGHT YOU
WERE CLEANING THE UPSTAIRS.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.457
IT'S CLEAN ENOUGH.

04:16.490 --> 04:19.092
AH, I WISH DAD WOULD
GET OUT OF THE WAY.
HMM.

04:19.126 --> 04:21.228
I WISH DAD WOULD TURN
INTO A WHITE HORSE,

04:21.261 --> 04:23.631
AND THEN THE BACKYARD
WOULD TURN INTO A BEACH...

04:23.664 --> 04:27.435
AND I WAS JUST AN INNOCENT
NATIVE GIRL COLLECTING SHELLS.

04:27.468 --> 04:30.671
IN A WHITE COTTON DRESS
THAT BILLOWS

04:30.704 --> 04:32.606
IN EVERY WARM BREEZE,

04:32.640 --> 04:36.009
AND THEN THINGS GET NASTY.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.611
KYLE.

04:37.645 --> 04:40.113
NO, HE'S NOT THERE.

04:40.147 --> 04:41.649
HI, MANDY.
HI, EVERYBODY.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.451
(gasps and chuckles nervously)

04:43.484 --> 04:45.319
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
STANDING THERE?

04:45.353 --> 04:48.522
SINCE RIGHT BEFORE
THINGS GOT NASTY.

04:48.556 --> 04:51.625
HEY! SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

04:51.659 --> 04:53.761
OKAY, SO I WAS
AT THE CAR WASH...
(sighs) MM-HMM.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.363
AND I FOUND THIS LITTLE,
TINY LICENSE PLATE

04:55.396 --> 04:57.030
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.600
AW!
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.802
I GOT THIS ONE FOR ME.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.437
THAT SAYS "KARL."

05:03.471 --> 05:06.640
YEAH.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE "KYLE."

05:06.674 --> 05:08.108
BUT I'LL KNOW.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.378
ALL RIGHT.
I BETTER GO.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.780
OKAY, WAIT. UM...

05:12.813 --> 05:14.014
ARE YOU MAD?

05:14.047 --> 05:15.315
SORT OF.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.551
I MEAN,
KYLE'S A PRETTY COMMON NAME.

05:18.852 --> 05:21.789
NO. I MEAN, LIKE,
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE MAD

05:21.822 --> 05:23.791
THAT YOU CAUGHT ME
STARING OUT THE WINDOW,

05:23.824 --> 05:25.526
DROOLING OVER
A GORGEOUS GUY?

05:25.559 --> 05:29.897
GOD, MANDY.
THAT'S YOUR FATHER.

05:29.930 --> 05:34.134
NO! OH, MY GOD!
THE OTHER GUY!

05:34.167 --> 05:36.637
OH! (chuckles)
YEAH, THE GUY IN THE SHORTS.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.138
THAT ADDS UP.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.973
ALL RIGHT. I BETTER GO.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.642
IF I'M LATE, MR. ALZATE
MAKES ME CLEAN OUT

05:41.675 --> 05:43.577
THE FILTER
IN THE OUTDOOR TROUT POND,

05:43.611 --> 05:46.313
AND THEN FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
MY HANDS ARE ALL TROUTY.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.981
S...

05:48.015 --> 05:50.317
HUH. HE DOESN'T MIND.
(door opens)

05:50.350 --> 05:51.752
MM. WHAT A NICE GUY.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.187
WHAT A JERK! HE CATCHES ME
LUSTING AFTER A HOT GUY,

05:54.221 --> 05:55.656
HE'S ALL, LIKE,
CHILL ABOUT IT?

05:55.689 --> 05:57.090
WHY ISN'T HE FURIOUS?

05:57.124 --> 05:59.092
MM, KYLE WAS NEVER THE JEALOUS
TYPE WHEN WE WERE DATING.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.061
ONCE, A GUY SLIPPED ME
HIS NUMBER.

06:01.094 --> 06:04.031
HE AND KYLE STILL TALK.

06:04.064 --> 06:07.768
YOU KNOW, YOUR FATHER
USED TO BE INSANELY JEALOUS.

06:07.801 --> 06:11.104
IF A MAN SAID I WAS BEAUTIFUL,
HE'D YELL, "NO, SHE'S NOT!"

06:11.138 --> 06:13.474
(laughs)

06:17.411 --> 06:19.079
MY BOYFRIEND LIKES ME
TO LOOK AT OTHER MEN

06:19.112 --> 06:20.614
AND GET ALL WORKED UP.
(laughs)

06:20.648 --> 06:22.950
IT'S A TIME-SAVER FOR HIM.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.287
HE'S GONNA BE VERY HAPPY
TONIGHT.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.091
GOOD JOB!

06:31.124 --> 06:32.960
WAY TO PICK THE CORNER.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.394
I-IF I MAY MAKE
A SUGGESTION?

06:34.428 --> 06:37.798
OH, YES. I'M GLAD
YOU'RE NOT OUT OF THEM.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.933
OR WE COULD JUST LET
THE GUY WHO PLAYED SOCCER

06:39.967 --> 06:41.602
ALL HIS LIFE DO HIS JOB.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.571
THAT MAY, IN FACT,
BE THE PROBLEM.

06:43.604 --> 06:44.805
ALL HE KNOWS IS SOCCER.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.206
SOMETIMES TO REALLY
UNDERSTAND SOMETHING,

06:46.239 --> 06:48.308
YOU NEED A FISHING ANALOGY.

06:48.341 --> 06:50.243
UH, MR. BAXTER,

06:50.277 --> 06:52.613
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN COACHING
EVE FOR A LONG TIME--

06:52.646 --> 06:54.782
YEAH. WHEN I STARTED WITH HER,
SHE COULDN'T EVEN WALK.

06:54.815 --> 06:57.651
YEAH. BUT MAYBE IF YOU
LET ME TAKE IT FROM HERE.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.720
YOU'RE NOT KICKING ME
OUT OF MY OWN YARD, ARE YOU?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.455
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

07:01.489 --> 07:03.156
EVE, LET'S FINISH
THIS LESSON AT THE FIELD.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.125
SORRY, DAD.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.294
MR. BAXTER, COULD YOU
TOSS ME THAT BALL?

07:07.327 --> 07:08.662
OH, SURE.

07:10.598 --> 07:11.965
(scoffs) NOT SUPPOSED TO
USE YOUR HANDS.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.901
I'M SURPRISED
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.477
(sighs)

07:27.815 --> 07:32.452
WOW! WHO'S THAT TALL, CUTE GUY
IN THE SEXY HIP WADERS?

07:32.486 --> 07:34.855
(laughs) THAT'S JUST A DISPLAY.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.495
(singsongy) I WAS ACTUALLY
TALKING ABOUT YOU, KYLE.

07:41.529 --> 07:43.497
(both laugh)

07:43.531 --> 07:44.965
(normal voice)
HEY, LISTEN. I--

07:44.998 --> 07:47.835
I JUST CAME BY TO APOLOGIZE
ABOUT THAT THING--

07:47.868 --> 07:51.939
ME AND EVE'S SOCCER COACH.
THAT WAS WRONG.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.975
YEAH, DON'T WORRY.
(chuckles) DIDN'T BOTHER ME.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.644
YEAH, I KNOW.
(water splashing)

07:56.677 --> 08:00.147
'CAUSE YOU KEEP SAYING THAT,
BUT I WANT IT TO.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.715
UM, I MEAN, COME ON.

08:01.749 --> 08:04.451
I WAS, LIKE, FANTASIZING
ABOUT ANOTHER GUY.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.787
YEAH, BUT, MANDY,
WE ALL HAVE FANTASIES.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.457
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I LIKE
TO IMAGINE MYSELF

08:10.490 --> 08:13.293
STRETCHED OUT
ON THIS KING-SIZE BED

08:13.326 --> 08:17.364
WITH SOME COLD PEACH ICED TEA
AND A BOLOGNA SANDWICH...

08:17.397 --> 08:21.001
WITH MUSTARD. NO. MAYO.

08:21.034 --> 08:25.105
YOU KNOW WHAT? BOTH.
IT'S MY FANTASY.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.641
OR MAYBE THE REASON

08:27.675 --> 08:29.810
THAT YOU'RE NOT JEALOUS
IS BECAUSE

08:29.843 --> 08:31.845
YOU DON'T REALLY CARE
ABOUT LOSING ME.

08:31.879 --> 08:34.982
I WOULD HATE LOSING YOU.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.750
BUT...

08:36.784 --> 08:40.153
IF YOU AND OCTAVIO REALLY
WANTED TO BE TOGETHER, THEN...

08:40.187 --> 08:41.655
I WOULDN'T WANT TO STAY
IN YOUR WAY.

08:41.689 --> 08:42.923
I WANT YOU TWO TO BE HAPPY.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.424
I... I DON'T WANT
TO BE HAPPY.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.059
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE JEALOUS.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.494
I'M SORRY.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.897
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE SORRY.
I JUST WANT YOU TO BE JEALOUS!

08:49.930 --> 08:52.265
I APOLOGIZE.
OH, MY GOD, THAT IS THE SAME
THING AS BEING SORRY!

08:52.299 --> 08:55.235
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE JEALOUS?!
WILL YOU JUST
CALM DOWN, KRISTIN?

08:57.805 --> 08:59.539
DID YOU JUST CALL ME
"KRISTIN"?

09:00.641 --> 09:03.110
I DON'T KNOW.

09:03.143 --> 09:06.246
IT MAKES SENSE, THOUGH.
I USED TO DATE A KRISTIN.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.049
KYLE, YOU JUST CALLED ME

09:09.082 --> 09:10.951
THE NAME
OF A FORMER GIRLFRIEND...

09:10.984 --> 09:12.452
WHO'S MY SISTER.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.087
NOT COOL.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.189
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
IF I CALLED YOU BRANDON,

09:16.223 --> 09:18.792
OR TRAVIS OR TYLER
OR GREG OR ASHTON...
(stammers)

09:18.826 --> 09:20.594
OR THE OTHER ASHTON?

09:20.628 --> 09:22.996
ACTUALLY, I WOULDN'T MIND
BEING CALLED "TYLER."

09:24.131 --> 09:25.432
I'D WEAR FANCY CLOTHES
AND, YOU KNOW,

09:25.465 --> 09:28.368
GIVE EVERYONE FINGER GUNS--
"HEY!" (chuckles)

09:28.401 --> 09:31.538
OH, MY GOD, I HATE
FIGHTING WITH SOMEBODY

09:31.571 --> 09:32.906
WHO WON'T FIGHT BACK!

09:32.940 --> 09:35.909
NOW I'VE GOTTA GO BE MAD
FOR THE BOTH OF US!

09:35.943 --> 09:37.911
(sighs)

09:37.945 --> 09:40.113
COME ON, BOLOGNA,
TAKE ME AWAY.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.054
(door opens)

09:47.087 --> 09:48.555
OH, HEY, BLANCA.
HEY.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.957
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO COOK. YOU CAN GO HOME.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.592
OH, BUT MR. MIKE ASKED ME
TO STAY AND MAKE DINNER.

09:52.626 --> 09:55.462
OH, HE MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN
THAT I WAS GONNA MAKE DINNER.

09:55.495 --> 10:00.133
YES, THAT MUST BE WHY.
HE FORGOT.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.969
(clicking)
MIKE, WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:02.002 --> 10:03.804
LOOKING FOR EVE'S GAME
ON YOUR PHONE.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.806
YEAH--NO, HONEY, I-I TOLD YOU
IT DIDN'T COME OUT.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.141
IT--IT--
I KNOW, IT WAS GRAINY,
BUT YOU GOT SOMETHING HERE.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.811
DID YOU HEAR WHAT OCTOPI
TOLD THE COACH?
MNH.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.246
HE TOLD EVE'S COACH THAT SHE'S
SUPPOSED TO PLAY DEFENSE.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.815
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
DEFENSE?

10:14.848 --> 10:17.617
IT'S DE THING THAT GOES
AROUND DE HOUSE?

10:17.651 --> 10:19.252
(mouths words)

10:19.286 --> 10:21.454
NOT EVERYTHING IS A JOKE,
HONEY.
(mutters)

10:21.488 --> 10:24.124
SHE'S GOTTA PLAY FORWARD.
SHE'S GOTTA SCORE SOME GOALS.
(sighs)

10:24.157 --> 10:25.625
AND I'M LOOKING FOR WHERE
SHE DID THAT PENALTY SHOT.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.795
IT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE.
(applause on TV)

10:27.828 --> 10:29.329
THERE, THERE, THERE.
LOOK HERE. LOOK HERE.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.964
YEAH.
SEE, WATCH HER GO AROUND.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.000
LOOK AT HOW SHE DOES--
(sighs)

10:33.033 --> 10:35.635
(applause continues)
WHAT ARE WE--
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

10:41.174 --> 10:42.810
WHY ARE WE LOOKING
AT THIS GUY'S BUTT?

10:42.843 --> 10:44.812
MOVE AROUND--IT--
YEAH, YOU KNOW, IT'S--
IT'S OCTAVIO.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.147
HE JUST--HE JUST KEPT GETTING
IN FRONT OF ME AS I--

10:47.180 --> 10:50.050
WHY ARE YOU ZOOMING IN
ON HIS ASS?

10:50.083 --> 10:53.153
I DON'T KNOW, HONEY.
I'M NOT A SCIENTIST.
JUST--JUST--

10:53.186 --> 10:56.456
I'M GONNA FAST-FORWARD
PAST THIS--

10:56.489 --> 10:58.358
THERE WE GO. RIGHT HERE.
WATCH HER SCORE HERE.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.893
SHE SHOOTS IT OVER
TO THAT JANICE GIRL, RIGHT?

10:59.927 --> 11:02.129
SHE CENTERS IT UP, SHE SHOOT--
WATCH THIS, WATCH THIS.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.630
GET A PENALTY--YOU GOTTA
SHOOT OVER THIS WAY.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.632
SHOOT OVER--
IT'S A PERFECT KICK, SCORE!

11:05.665 --> 11:06.800
(cheering)

11:06.834 --> 11:08.635
AND THANK GOD
THIS STRANGE EUROPEAN GUY--

11:08.668 --> 11:10.137
HE GOT IT ALL.
LOOK AT THIS.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.839
(knock on door)
WHAT IS THIS?

11:11.872 --> 11:13.240
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?
I DON'T KNOW.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.407
I'M SORRY.
I GOT DISTRACTED.

11:14.441 --> 11:15.809
I-I DON'T THINK
YOU WERE DISTRACTED.

11:15.843 --> 11:19.146
YOU WERE SPOT-ON, HONEY.
YOU REALLY ZEROED IN.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.915
OH. (chuckles) OCTAVIO.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.483
UH, COME IN, COME IN.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.252
UH, GOSH, I WISH I'D KNOWN
YOU WERE COMING. I--

11:25.285 --> 11:27.855
YEAH, SHE WOULD HAVE MADE
HERSELF 20 YEARS YOUNGER.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.227
I'VE COME TO GET EVE
FOR OUR PRACTICE.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.764
WHY DOES SHE NEED TO PRACTICE
TO STAND AROUND ON DEFENSE

11:36.797 --> 11:38.231
AND WATCH OTHER PEOPLE
SCORE?

11:38.265 --> 11:40.768
OH, SHE TOLD YOU I WANT
TO MOVE HER TO DEFENSE.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.435
WELL, YOU KNOW, IN SOCCER,

11:42.469 --> 11:44.104
EVERY POSITION IS
EQUALLY IMPORTANT.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.440
OH, STOP WITH YOUR EUROPEAN
SOCIALIST HOO-HAH!

11:47.474 --> 11:50.443
THIS IS AMERICA.
WE CELEBRATE SUPERSTARS.

11:50.477 --> 11:53.613
WE WANT HER TO BE HUEY LEWIS,
NOT THE NEWS.

11:53.646 --> 11:56.549
WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT SHE'LL
NEVER BE HUEY LEWIS.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.118
OH, NO, WAIT. NO, NO, NO.
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT--YEAH.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.452
EVE HAS ALWAYS BEEN
REALLY GOOD, SO--

11:59.486 --> 12:01.521
AND WE THINK SCHOLARSHIP,
MAYBE THE OLYMPICS.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.024
OKAY, LET ME PUT THIS IN TERMS
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.027
IF SOCCER WAS FISHING,

12:07.060 --> 12:10.764
EVE WOULD NOT BE GOOD
AT... FISHING.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.534
I'M AFRAID THERE ARE
NO SCHOLARSHIPS FOR HER.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.136
SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS...
(sighs)

12:16.169 --> 12:18.105
LET HER PLAY FOR THE JOY.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.472
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE'RE BAXTERS.

12:19.506 --> 12:22.776
WE DON'T DO ANYTHING
FOR THE JOY.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.779
WELL, I'M SORRY TO SAY,
THAT'S TRUE.

12:25.813 --> 12:29.282
WE BUST OUR ASS AROUND HERE
TO BE THE BEST AT THINGS.
YEAH.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.418
AND CLEARLY IF YOU DON'T THINK
THAT SHE HAS THE SKILL SET

12:31.451 --> 12:33.821
TO DO THAT, I'M JUST GONNA
GET ANOTHER COACH.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.455
BUT--
I THINK IT'S BEST.

12:35.488 --> 12:38.625
OKAY. WELL, I'M SAD
TO HEAR THAT, BUT...

12:38.658 --> 12:40.227
OKAY.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.495
PLEASE TELL EVE I ENJOYED
OUR PRIVATE LESSONS

12:42.529 --> 12:44.297
AND I'LL SEE HER
AT THE GAME.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.934
UH, YOU'LL SEE ME
AT THE GAME, TOO, OCTAVIO.

12:46.967 --> 12:50.470
UH, I'LL--I'LL BE THERE
SATURDAY. JUST...

12:50.503 --> 12:51.972
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE
20 YEARS YOUNGER,

12:52.005 --> 12:53.440
YOU COULD JUST
CHASE HIM DOWN.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.275
OH, SHUT UP.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.850
MAYBE OCTAVIO IS RIGHT.
HUH?

13:02.883 --> 13:05.285
MAYBE IT ISN'T SUCH
A GOOD IDEA TO PUSH EVE.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.987
IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA
TO PUSH.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.155
YOU KNOW WHO DIDN'T
GET PUSHED?

13:08.188 --> 13:09.522
WHO? (sighs)
(switch clicks)

13:09.556 --> 13:11.791
EXACTLY.
YOU NEVER HEARD OF 'EM. WHY?

13:11.825 --> 13:13.793
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T
GET PUSHED.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.128
(scoffs) YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:15.162 --> 13:16.629
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE
REALISTIC.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.265
I DON'T WANT EVE
TO GET HER HEART BROKEN.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.666
I AM BEING REALISTIC.

13:19.699 --> 13:21.634
I'M GONNA BE
THE PROUD PARENT

13:21.668 --> 13:23.636
WATCHING HER IN THE OLYMPICS
PLAYING SOCCER THERE,

13:23.670 --> 13:26.773
PROBABLY SITTING BY MYSELF
WITH AN EMPTY SEAT NEXT TO ME.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.308
COME ON. WHO ARE WE KIDDING?
IT'S WOMEN'S SOCCER.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.477
THERE'S GONNA BE
A LOT OF EMPTY SEATS.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.879
LOOK, I JUST DON'T WANT HER

13:31.912 --> 13:33.646
TO HAVE UNREALISTIC
EXPECTATIONS.
(sighs)

13:33.680 --> 13:35.615
I MEAN, N-NOT EVERYBODY
CAN BE A ROCK STAR

13:35.648 --> 13:39.452
OR A SUPERMODEL
OR... A GEOLOGIST.

13:39.486 --> 13:43.290
BECAUSE, I MEAN, HEY,
WE'RE ROCK STARS, TOO.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.059
(speaks indistinctly)
IT'S NOT FUNNY ON YOUR
LICENSE PLATE BRACKET,

13:46.093 --> 13:47.794
AND IT'S NOT FUNNY
RIGHT NOW.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.897
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA TELL EVE
WHEN SHE ASKS

13:49.930 --> 13:51.298
WHY YOU FIRED HIM?

13:51.331 --> 13:52.799
EVE'S TOUGH.
SHE'LL GET OVER IT.
(sighs)

13:52.832 --> 13:54.367
SHE'S A BAXTER. WE DON'T CARE
WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT US.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.069
YEAH, WHICH YOU PROVE
EVERY MORNING

13:56.103 --> 14:00.373
WHEN YOU GO OUT TO GET
THE NEWSPAPER IN YOUR UNDERWEAR.
(switch clicks)

14:00.407 --> 14:02.976
OR, AS MRS. GREEN, OUR NEIGHBOR,
REFERS TO IT AS,

14:03.010 --> 14:05.312
THE BEST TWO MINUTES
OF HER DAY.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.847
(switch clicks)

14:08.949 --> 14:11.484
HEY, MIKE BAXTER HERE
FOR OUTDOOR MAN.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.686
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY'S LIFE
HAS FAILURES,

14:13.720 --> 14:14.988
BUT THE TEST OF YOUR CHARACTER

14:15.022 --> 14:16.556
IS HOW YOU RESPOND
TO THOSE FAILURES.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.691
WHEN LIFE KNOCKS YOU DOWN,
YOU DON'T LIE ON THE CANVAS

14:18.725 --> 14:22.762
CRYING AND OVEREATING LIKE
AL GORE AFTER THE 2000 ELECTION.

14:22.795 --> 14:26.499
(laughs) BOY, HE BLEW UP
LIKE THE HINDENBURG, DIDN'T HE?

14:26.533 --> 14:29.102
LOOK, YOU GOTTA GET UP
AND START SWINGING.

14:29.136 --> 14:31.004
MICHAEL JORDAN GOT CUT
AS A SOPHOMORE

14:31.038 --> 14:32.772
FROM HIS HIGH SCHOOL
VARSITY TEAM.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.407
DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE AWARE OF THIS,

14:34.441 --> 14:37.945
BUT THAT WASN'T THE LAST TIME
HE EVER PLAYED BASKETBALL.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.613
J.K. ROWLING HAD
"HARRY POTTER" TURNED DOWN

14:40.647 --> 14:41.949
BY A DOZEN PUBLISHERS.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.416
DID SHE QUIDDITCH?

14:45.485 --> 14:48.288
NOT ON YOUR LIFE-ITCH.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.123
ABRAHAM--OLD HONEST ABE--

14:50.157 --> 14:52.225
HAD A LONG STRING
OF POLITICAL LOSSES.

14:52.259 --> 14:55.228
BUT DID HE EVER GIVE UP?
NO, HE DID NOT.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.965
HE DID GET SHOT, HOWEVER.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.732
OH, GREAT!

14:59.766 --> 15:02.469
I GUESS I DON'T NEED TO SEE
THAT MOVIE NOW.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.944
YOU GOTTA--
PAU-PAUSE IT FOR A SECOND.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.779
PAUSE IT. ALL RIGHT.
I NEED AN END TO THIS.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.714
LIKE, "WINNING IS EVERYTHING"
SOUNDS STUPID. UH...

15:14.747 --> 15:16.249
OH, HOW ABOUT, UM...

15:16.283 --> 15:18.518
HOW ABOUT "NEVER GIVE UP.
NEVER SURRENDER"?

15:20.087 --> 15:22.655
I LIKE IT.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.157
NEVER GIVE UP.

15:24.191 --> 15:26.626
NEVER SURRENDER.

15:26.659 --> 15:30.430
THOSE ARE SOME WISE WORDS,
MR. B.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.732
YOU KNOW, UH, MANDY AND I
HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH

15:32.765 --> 15:34.801
KIND OF A HARD TIME.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.636
BUT I THINK
I'LL TAKE YOUR ADVICE

15:36.669 --> 15:38.805
AND NOT GIVE UP
ON OUR RELATIONSHIP.

15:38.838 --> 15:40.440
WELL...

15:40.473 --> 15:43.610
I THINK THAT DOES GIVE ME
AN IDEA FOR TOMORROW'S VLOG.

15:43.643 --> 15:46.279
"HOW TO BURY A YOUNG MAN
IN YOUR BASEMENT."

15:46.313 --> 15:48.115
(door opens)

15:48.148 --> 15:49.616
UH, OH, KYLE.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ME?

15:49.649 --> 15:51.451
YEAH. MR. ALZATE, UM...
YEAH?

15:51.484 --> 15:54.487
I'M HAVING SOME...
LADY PROBLEMS.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.590
WHAT, LIKE CRAMPS?

15:57.624 --> 15:59.259
UH, NO.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.461
MANDY AND I ARE HAVING
SOME ROMANTIC PROBLEMS.

16:01.494 --> 16:02.962
YOU SAID WE COULD TALK.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.764
OH, YEAH. FIRE AWAY.
GO AHEAD.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.033
NOT IN HERE. PLEASE.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.667
HE'S UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH CONVERSATIONS

16:07.700 --> 16:09.902
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTERS
AND THEIR LOVERS.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.206
COME ON.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.807
OKAY. OKAY. GO AHEAD.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.476
SO, MANDY AND I WERE
IN THE MIDDLE

16:16.509 --> 16:17.977
OF A VERY PASSIONATE
MOMENT YESTERDAY--

16:18.011 --> 16:20.147
HEY! GUYS, I CAN STILL
HEAR YOU.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.614
(door slams)

16:21.648 --> 16:23.783
THIS IS REAL LIFE, MIKE.
YOU CAN'T IGNORE IT.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.618
NOW, COME ON...

16:25.652 --> 16:27.787
ANYWAY, IN THE MIDDLE,
I GOT CONFUSED...
UH-HUH.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.357
AND ACCIDENTALLY CALLED
MANDY "KRISTIN."

16:30.390 --> 16:34.794
OH... NO. OUCH.
THAT'S A BAD MOVE, SON. NO.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.964
YOU SEE, WHEN A MAN
IS IN THE THROES OF INTIMACY

16:37.997 --> 16:41.134
WITH A WOMAN, YOU'VE GOT
A LOT ON YOUR MIND, RIGHT?

16:41.168 --> 16:43.970
IT'S BEST TO STICK
WITH NONSPECIFIC NAMES.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.807
ALL RIGHT. SUCH AS, UH,
"YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL, HONEY."

16:47.840 --> 16:50.477
"THAT FEELS WONDERFUL,
DARLING." HUH?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.312
"YOU KEEP DOING THAT,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO BUY YOU

16:52.345 --> 16:53.980
A CONDOMINIUM, PRINCESS."

16:54.013 --> 16:55.648
YOU SEE?

16:55.682 --> 16:58.985
OKAY, BUT, UM, WE WEREN'T
IN ANY THROES.
HMM.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.653
UH, WE WERE HAVING A FIGHT.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.422
WELL, THE SAME APPLIES
TO FIGHTING.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.424
YEAH, YEAH,
"CALM DOWN, HONEY."

17:04.457 --> 17:06.693
UH, "THAT GUN MIGHT BE
LOADED, DARLING."

17:06.726 --> 17:09.529
YEAH.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.098
"THAT NAKED WOMAN
IN THE SHOWER WITH ME?

17:11.131 --> 17:12.599
THAT'S MY PLUMBER, PRINCESS."

17:12.632 --> 17:14.434
(speaks indistinctly)

17:14.467 --> 17:15.768
THAT'S GOOD ADVICE.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.604
I REALLY DON'T LIKE
FIGHTING.
MM-HMM.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.872
YOU KNOW, IF MANDY AND I
PULL THROUGH THIS ONE,

17:19.906 --> 17:22.041
NEVER HAVING ANOTHER ONE.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.611
SOLID PLAN.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.285
DAD?

17:32.319 --> 17:35.555
HEY. WHAT'S--WHAT'S GOING ON?
I JUST GOT A TEXT FROM OCTAVIO

17:35.588 --> 17:37.590
SAYING THAT HE'S NOT GONNA
GIVE ME PRIVATE LESSONS ANYMORE.

17:37.624 --> 17:42.129
YEAH, THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S
A EUROPEAN SURRENDER MONKEY.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.764
HE SAID THAT YOU FIRED HIM.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.933
HE DIDN'T PUT UP
THAT MUCH OF A FIGHT.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.602
WELL, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
I WAS REALLY LEARNING A LOT.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.438
BECAUSE I WANT SOMEBODY
IN YOUR CORNER

17:51.471 --> 17:52.872
THAT BELIEVES IN YOU.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.807
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:54.841 --> 17:56.576
H-HE... (sighs)

17:56.609 --> 17:58.911
HE DIDN'T THINK
THAT YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES

17:58.945 --> 18:00.747
TO GET A SCHOLARSHIP
PLAYING SOCCER.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.816
HE SAID THAT?

18:03.850 --> 18:06.186
HE ALSO SAID YOU WERE
NO GOOD AT FISHING.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.622
LISTEN, EVE.
NO, HOLD ON A SECOND.

18:09.656 --> 18:10.990
HONEY, THIS IS WHAT
I WAS AFRAID OF.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.459
SEE, NOW SHE'S CRUSHED.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.627
WELL, SHE'S GONNA HAVE
TO TOUGHEN UP.
(sighs)

18:14.661 --> 18:17.597
LISTEN, JUST BECAUSE OXYMORON
DOESN'T GIVE HER A GOLD STAR--
(sighs) IT'S OCTAVIO!

18:17.630 --> 18:19.132
WE BOTH KNOW WHO WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.633
WELL, MAYBE NOW
SHE CAN PLAY SOCCER

18:20.667 --> 18:22.135
JUST FOR THE SHEER JOY
OF IT.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.603
"JOY OF IT"?
YEAH.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.405
SCREW THAT! I DON'T DO ANYTHING
FOR JOY AROUND HERE.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.274
I'M A BAXTER. COME ON, DAD,
DRIVE ME TO THE FIELD.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.641
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
EVE, HONEY,

18:28.675 --> 18:30.310
ARE YOU NOT UPSET
ABOUT WHAT OCTAVIO SAID?

18:30.343 --> 18:31.978
WELL, YEAH, I'M REALLY UPSET.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.113
THAT'S WHY DAD AND I ARE GONNA
GO PRACTICE SOME PENALTY KICKS.

18:34.147 --> 18:37.684
GONNA SHOW THAT EURO-DORK
WHAT'S UP.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.586
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
(door opens)

18:39.619 --> 18:41.154
THAT'S MICHAEL JORDAN
RIGHT THERE.

18:41.188 --> 18:43.122
THAT'S NO AL GORE.
(laughs)

18:43.156 --> 18:46.159
I AM PROUD OF YOU.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

18:46.193 --> 18:49.329
NOW LET'S MOVE IT, OLD-TIMER.
YOU WANT A BOAT OR NOT?

18:51.331 --> 18:53.300
I'M GETTING A BOAT.
MM.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.009
THANK YOU.

19:04.511 --> 19:07.113
HE JUST LEFT ME 5 BUCKS
ON A $10 TAB.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.515
YEP. I GET IT.
MM.

19:08.548 --> 19:09.949
MEN LOVE YOU, KRISTIN.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.884
(clicks tongue)
CAN'T FORGET YOU, KRISTIN.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.686
CONSTANTLY CALLING OUT
YOUR NAME--

19:13.720 --> 19:16.122
"KRISTIN, KRISTIN, KRISTIN!"

19:16.155 --> 19:19.559
WELL, I DO WEAR
A NAME TAG, SO...

19:19.592 --> 19:21.294
DID I DO SOMETHING TO YOU?

19:21.328 --> 19:23.363
NO.
ARE YOU SURE?

19:23.396 --> 19:24.797
YES.
EH...

19:24.831 --> 19:26.299
IT'S NOTHING.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.834
WHAT?

19:27.867 --> 19:30.803
(clattering)
THE OTHER DAY... (sighs)

19:30.837 --> 19:33.473
KYLE AND I WERE, LIKE,
REALLY GOING AT IT,

19:33.506 --> 19:35.242
AND HE CALLED ME "KRISTIN."

19:35.275 --> 19:37.644
REALLY?

19:37.677 --> 19:38.811
YES.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.913
WHOA. (sighs nervously)

19:40.947 --> 19:43.816
THIS IS KIND OF
AN AWKWARD SISTER MOMENT.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.318
YEAH.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.986
KIND OF A "YAY, ME" MOMENT...

19:47.019 --> 19:49.155
(chuckles) BUT STILL AWKWARD.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.424
WELL, IT MADE ME FEEL
AWFUL, SO...

19:51.458 --> 19:54.827
WELL, IT SHOULDN'T. WHAT KYLE
DID IS ONLY NATURAL, OKAY?

19:54.861 --> 19:57.930
YOU KNOW, HE AND I HAD
SOME PRETTY INTIMATE MOMENTS.

19:57.964 --> 20:01.934
WAIT. (imitates retching)
STOP. NO. NO.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.770
WE--WE WERE FIGHTING.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.238
WHAT?
YEAH.

20:05.272 --> 20:07.274
LIKE, REALLY GOING AT IT.
LIKE, "RRR!"

20:07.307 --> 20:08.608
I WAS SCREAMING AT HIM,

20:08.641 --> 20:10.243
AND HE WAS ALL,
"CALM DOWN, KRISTIN."

20:10.277 --> 20:12.612
OH. WAIT A MINUTE.
SO, YOU WERE SCREAMING AT HIM,

20:12.645 --> 20:14.847
AND HE IMMEDIATELY
PICTURES ME?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.182
SO?

20:16.215 --> 20:19.619
SO, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
FLATTERING TO ME.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.454
OH, MY GOD, OF COURSE!

20:21.488 --> 20:23.756
THAT MAKES SO MUCH
MORE SENSE! YEAH.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.392
'CAUSE... (chuckles)

20:25.425 --> 20:28.127
LIKE, I WAS BEING A REAL BITCH,
SO NATURALLY HE THOUGHT OF YOU.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.064
GLAD TO HELP.

20:32.098 --> 20:34.301
COME ON, KRIS,
YOU GOTTA ADMIT, YOU COULD BE

20:34.334 --> 20:35.768
PRETTY HARD ON KYLE
WHEN YOU GUYS WERE DATING.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.437
YEAH, I GUESS I WAS.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.739
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE WOULD SAY
SOMETHING DUMB, WHICH...

20:39.772 --> 20:41.408
DOESN'T BOTHER YOU,
BECAUSE YOU'RE...

20:41.441 --> 20:43.443
COMPATIBLE.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.278
THANK YOU.

20:45.312 --> 20:48.281
HEY... HONEY.
AW.

20:48.315 --> 20:50.149
(coins clatter)

20:50.182 --> 20:52.652
I CAME TO APOLOGIZE AGAIN...

20:52.685 --> 20:54.487
PRINCESS.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.789
NO, LISTEN, KYLE.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.125
I'M THE ONE WHO SHOULD BE
APOLOGIZING.

20:59.158 --> 21:03.095
LOOKING AT OCTAVIO LIKE THAT
WASN'T VERY RESPECTFUL.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.465
HE'S PROBABLY USED TO IT.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.434
HE'S GORGEOUS.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.970
NO, I MEANT NOT RESPECTFUL
OF YOU

21:11.003 --> 21:13.105
AND OUR RELATIONSHIP.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.441
SO I'M SORRY.

21:14.474 --> 21:15.608
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SORRY.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.410
WOULD YOU PLEASE JUST ACCEPT
MY DAMN APOLOGY?

21:17.444 --> 21:19.312
APOLOGY ACCEPTED, KRIS...

21:19.346 --> 21:21.314
UH, PRINCESS.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.650
(giggles)

21:23.683 --> 21:25.117
OOH, WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,

21:25.151 --> 21:26.619
YOU MIGHT WANT TO THROW
AN APOLOGY KRISTIN'S WAY.

21:26.653 --> 21:27.954
WHY?
(dish clatters)

21:27.987 --> 21:29.989
SO, I'M BITCHY, HUH?
