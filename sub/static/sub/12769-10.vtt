♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:06.667 --> 00:09.041
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE NOT CHARGING HIM?

00:09.083 --> 00:11.333
I'M NOT CHARGING HIM.
SORRY.
I HEARD YOU.

00:11.375 --> 00:13.333
BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE NOT CHARGING HIM?

00:13.375 --> 00:15.041
LOOK, MISTER--
DR. FREEDMAN.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.583
DR. COOPER FREEDMAN.
THIS IS DR. CHARLOTTE KING.

00:17.625 --> 00:20.041
THE MAN YOU SHOULD BE CHARGING
IS LEE McHENRY.

00:20.083 --> 00:21.583
DO YOU KNOW THE CASE?

00:21.625 --> 00:23.834
OKAY, WE'D LIKE
ANOTHER LAWYER--

00:23.875 --> 00:27.667
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT
THEY'RE DOING, SOMEONE GOOD.

00:27.709 --> 00:29.458
MS. KING'S FIRST STATEMENT
TO THE POLICE

00:29.500 --> 00:31.458
WAS THAT SHE WAS ROBBED--
NOT RAPED, ROBBED.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.542
SHE LIED TO THE POLICE,
WHICH TAINTS HER AS A WITNESS.

00:33.583 --> 00:35.041
THE RAPE KIT WASN'T PROCESSED

00:35.083 --> 00:37.041
UNTIL TWO WEEKS AFTER
THE ALLEGED RAPE,

00:37.083 --> 00:38.542
WHICH TAINTS THE EVIDENCE.

00:38.583 --> 00:41.583
MS. KING FAILED TO IDENTIFY
LEE McHENRY IN THE FIRST LINEUP.

00:41.625 --> 00:44.166
THE SECOND LINEUP CAME ONLY
AFTER A DR. SHELDON WALLACE,

00:44.208 --> 00:46.166
FROM YOUR PRACTICE,
SPOKE TO LEE McHENRY,

00:46.208 --> 00:48.250
SO THAT'S ALSO TAINTED.

00:48.291 --> 00:50.250
AND, MS. KING,
I MEAN NO DISRESPECT,

00:50.291 --> 00:53.000
BUT YOU'RE A SEX THERAPIST WITH
A HISTORY OF MEETING STRANGE MEN

00:53.041 --> 00:55.500
FROM THE INTERNET FOR WHAT CAN
AT BEST BE DESCRIBED

00:55.542 --> 00:57.500
AS FETISHISTIC
SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS.

00:57.542 --> 01:00.041
I KNOW THE CASE.

01:00.083 --> 01:03.291
MR. FREEDMAN, I GRADUATED FIRST
IN MY CLASS FROM STANFORD.

01:03.333 --> 01:05.542
I HAVE A 90% CONVICTION RATE
HERE IN THE D.A.'s OFFICE,

01:05.583 --> 01:07.583
100% ON RAPE,
SO I'M PRETTY DAMN GOOD,

01:07.625 --> 01:10.000
WHICH IS WHY I CAN SAY TO YOU
WITHOUT HESITATION

01:10.041 --> 01:13.000
THAT THERE IS NO WAY THIS OFFICE
IS GOING TO CHARGE LEE McHENRY.

01:13.041 --> 01:15.542
I'M SORRY.

01:20.959 --> 01:22.500
HAVE A NICE DAY.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.542
(Naomi) THIS IS
THE RIBBON CUTTING CEREMONY

01:43.583 --> 01:46.417
OF THE NEW HOSPITAL
IN WESTERN INDIA.

01:46.458 --> 01:48.875
THIS WAS ALSO THE DAY
THAT OLIVIA SAT UP ON HER OWN

01:48.917 --> 01:51.458
FOR THE FIRST TIME.
MAYA AND I SKYPED.
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.625
THAT'S
QUITE AN ACCOMPLISHMENT.

01:53.667 --> 01:55.500
THE HOSPITAL, I MEAN.
BUT OLIVIA'S GREAT, TOO.

01:55.542 --> 01:58.083
YEAH. (laughs) AND HERE,
THE FOUNDATION IS DELIVERING

01:58.125 --> 02:01.458
A BOATLOAD
OF MOSQUITO NETS TO TANZANIA.
WOW.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.750
BOATLOAD. IT'S AN ACTUAL BOAT
LOADED WITH MOSQUITO NETS.

02:03.792 --> 02:05.625
THAT'S SO COOL.
(laughs)

02:05.667 --> 02:08.709
ACTUALLY, THAT'S WHERE I WAS
WHEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT,

02:08.750 --> 02:11.041
UH, BETSEY'S AUNT
ABANDONING HER.

02:11.083 --> 02:13.125
UM...

02:13.166 --> 02:15.959
THIS IS LAOS, AND HERE,
WE WERE ABLE TO DELIVER

02:16.000 --> 02:18.667
ENOUGH VACCINE
TO IMMUNIZE 2,000 CHILDREN.

02:18.709 --> 02:19.917
WOW.

02:19.959 --> 02:21.917
YEAH, AND THAT'S WHERE I WAS

02:21.959 --> 02:24.583
WHEN I FOUND OUT
ABOUT CHARLOTTE.

02:24.625 --> 02:26.667
YEAH, A LOT...

02:26.709 --> 02:29.000
HAS HAPPENED
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GONE.

02:31.792 --> 02:33.375
UH, OH.

02:33.417 --> 02:35.125
I HAVE A PATIENT.

02:35.166 --> 02:37.125
IT WAS GREAT
TO SEE YOU, NAI.

02:37.166 --> 02:40.166
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

02:40.208 --> 02:42.208
WHAT WAS THAT?

02:42.250 --> 02:44.041
NOTHING.
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

02:44.083 --> 02:45.750
I MEAN, FOR SOMEONE...
(Violet) YOU DO.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.542
WHO'S TREKKED ACROSS
THREE CONTINENTS...

02:47.583 --> 02:49.542
(laughs)
OH, YOU KNOW, I JUST--

02:49.583 --> 02:51.542
I'M ALL "EAT PRAY LOVE,"
YOU KNOW?

02:51.583 --> 02:53.917
I'M--I'M, UH, VERY ZEN.
ZEN?

02:53.959 --> 02:55.834
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE NOW ALL RIGHT

02:55.875 --> 02:57.834
WITH ADDISON SLEEPING
WITH YOUR EX-HUSBAND?
AMELIA!

02:57.875 --> 02:59.959
(Violet) FILTER.
SORRY. I'M WORKING ON IT.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.917
WELL, I FOR ONE AM GLAD
TO HAVE YOU BACK, SO...
THANK YOU.

03:03.959 --> 03:06.500
ALL RIGHT, TRUTH--
HOW IS CHARLOTTE?

03:06.542 --> 03:08.667
RAPE-Y AND WEIRD.

03:08.709 --> 03:10.542
(sighs) FILTER.

03:10.583 --> 03:13.041
CHARLOTTE... IS DOING
THE BEST SHE CAN.

03:13.083 --> 03:15.041
(Pete) HEY.

03:15.083 --> 03:17.041
EMILY WENDAL
IS BACK IN THE E.R.

03:17.083 --> 03:18.750
DAMN IT.

03:18.792 --> 03:19.834
AGAIN?

03:19.875 --> 03:22.834
WHAT,
WHO IS EMILY WENDAL?

03:22.875 --> 03:24.959
YOU SHOULD COME, TOO.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.041
HEY, UM... THE GUYS
ARE PLAYING POKER TONIGHT.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.583
YOU WANT TO DO A GIRLS' NIGHT,
GET ALL OF US TOGETHER,

03:30.625 --> 03:32.333
CATCH UP?
UH, YEAH, YEAH, I'M IN.

03:32.375 --> 03:34.041
YEAH?
YEAH.

03:34.083 --> 03:37.458
I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.792
I MISSED YOU.

03:40.834 --> 03:43.667
ARE YOU OKAY
WITH HER SCREWING SAM?

03:43.709 --> 03:45.166
FILTER.
YEAH.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.709
GOT IT.
OKAY.

03:51.083 --> 03:52.875
(blows air, clicks gearshift)

03:52.917 --> 03:56.041
I DON'T KNOW. I'M GONNA TRY
TO MAKE SOME PHONE CALLS,

03:56.083 --> 03:58.625
SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN...

03:58.667 --> 04:01.041
HOW DO THEY
NOT CHARGE THE BASTARD?

04:01.083 --> 04:04.500
WHAT WILL BE WILL BE.

04:04.542 --> 04:06.875
CHARLOTTE...

04:06.917 --> 04:08.875
YOU SEEM FINE.

04:08.917 --> 04:11.625
ARE YOU...
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THIS,

04:11.667 --> 04:14.208
WITH THEM
LETTING THAT GUY WALK?

04:14.250 --> 04:15.834
I'M RIGHT AS RAIN.

04:15.875 --> 04:17.333
OKAY. GOOD.

04:17.375 --> 04:19.333
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU FEEL

04:19.375 --> 04:21.333
LIKE YOU'RE IN CONTROL
OF WHAT HAPPENS.

04:21.375 --> 04:23.041
THIS IS YOUR CASE.

04:23.083 --> 04:25.625
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO FEEL SAFE.

04:25.667 --> 04:28.875
I'M IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT NOW.
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

04:28.917 --> 04:30.875
AND I KNOW
RECOVERY IS A PROCESS,

04:30.917 --> 04:33.041
SO IT'S OKAY
IF YOU'RE NOT FINE.

04:33.083 --> 04:36.041
BUT WE WILL GET THROUGH IT,
TOGETHER.

04:36.083 --> 04:39.333
YOU KNOW, IT'S A MARATHON,
NOT A SPRINT.

04:39.375 --> 04:40.917
RIGHT.

04:40.959 --> 04:42.917
AND WE CAN GO BACK THERE,

04:42.959 --> 04:44.917
WE CAN
MAKE THE D.A. CHARGE HIM.

04:44.959 --> 04:47.208
I DON'T KNOW HOW, BUT I WILL
THINK OF SOMETHING.

04:47.250 --> 04:50.000
IT'S ALWAYS DARKEST
BEFORE THE DAWN.

04:54.291 --> 04:56.041
(sighs)

04:56.083 --> 04:59.000
(door closes)

05:00.709 --> 05:04.542
IT'S ALWAYS DARKEST
BEFORE THE DAWN.

05:04.583 --> 05:05.917
(clicks gearshift)

05:05.959 --> 05:09.000
EMILY WENDAL PRESENTED WITH
HYPERTENSION AND EARLY LABOR.

05:09.041 --> 05:10.500
TREATED WITH LABETALOL.

05:10.542 --> 05:12.750
BLOOD PRESSURE STABILIZED.

05:12.792 --> 05:15.041
HER HISTORY INCLUDES
PREECLAMPSIA AND DRUG ADDICTION.

05:15.083 --> 05:17.041
EVERY TEN MONTHS,
RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.041
I HEARD EMILY'S BACK.
WHAT, IS SHE FAMOUS?

05:19.083 --> 05:20.709
(sighs)
SHE'S A FREQUENT FLYER.

05:20.750 --> 05:23.041
GETS KNOCKED UP EVERY YEAR
OR SO,

05:23.083 --> 05:25.750
THEN SHOWS UP IN THE E.R.
WHEN SHE'S CLOSE TO TERM.
HEY, I DON'T HAVE
ANY CASH ON ME. DO--

05:25.792 --> 05:27.750
I DO, I DO, I DO. TECHNICALLY,
IT'S MY TURN, RIGHT?

05:27.792 --> 05:29.750
'CAUSE YOU DID THE LAST TWO,

05:29.792 --> 05:32.041
AND CHARLOTTE DID
THE ONE BEFORE THAT.
WH-WH-WHY DO WE NEED CASH?

05:32.083 --> 05:34.959
WE GIVE HER 50 BUCKS,
SHE GIVES UP HER BABY.
WHAT?

05:35.000 --> 05:38.291
IT'S--
WELL, NO, NO, I MEAN, FIRST I
OFFER HER REHAB AND THERAPY.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.417
I GIVE HER THE LECTURE
ON SOBRIETY, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

05:40.458 --> 05:42.792
AND THEN YOU LECTURE ABOUT
SAFE SEX, OFFER TO PUT IN ONE OF

05:42.834 --> 05:44.959
THOSE IMPLANT-Y BIRTH CONTROL
THINGS THAT GO IN HER ARM,

05:45.000 --> 05:46.709
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
SHE WILL REFUSE,

05:46.750 --> 05:48.291
THEN YOU WILL DELIVER THE BABY,

05:48.333 --> 05:50.291
AND THEN PETE,
BECAUSE SHE ONLY LIKES PETE,

05:50.333 --> 05:53.542
WILL GIVE HER $50,
AND SHE'LL GIVE US THE BABY.
WELL, SHE LIKES ME

05:53.583 --> 05:56.208
BECAUSE I'VE HELPED HER GET
CLEAN, WHAT, LIKE, THREE TIMES?
YEAH.

05:56.250 --> 05:59.208
NOT THAT IT EVER LASTS
MORE THAN A WEEK.
ANYWAY, IT SHOULDN'T TAKE
TOO LONG.

05:59.250 --> 06:01.583
I'LL GET SOCIAL SERVICES
ON THE PHONE,

06:01.625 --> 06:04.542
LET 'EM KNOW
WE GOT ONE COMING.
OKAY, I'LL GET THE PAPERWORK
FOR HER TO SIGN.

06:04.583 --> 06:06.625
SO YOU WANT
TO EXAMINE HER FIRST,

06:06.667 --> 06:10.041
OR YOU WANT ME TO DO
MY SHRINK DANCE FIRST?
WHAT?

06:10.083 --> 06:13.041
COOPER. HEY.

06:13.083 --> 06:15.417
NAOMI. WELCOME BACK. HEY.

06:15.458 --> 06:19.542
I AM SO SORRY I COULDN'T COME
WHEN I HEARD ABOUT CHARLOTTE.

06:19.583 --> 06:21.625
HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

06:21.667 --> 06:23.875
WE, UH, WE'RE GOOD.
YEAH?

06:23.917 --> 06:26.041
OKAY. DEALING.

06:26.083 --> 06:27.542
YEAH.

06:27.583 --> 06:29.583
OH, MY GOD.
LOOK, JUSTIN TAYLOR.

06:29.625 --> 06:32.583
YEAH?
I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS KID
IN, LIKE, THREE YEARS.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.625
I THOUGHT HE HAD MOVED
OR SOMETHING. HE'S...

06:34.667 --> 06:36.875
HE'S ONE OF THE GOOD ONES.

06:36.917 --> 06:38.875
HE USED TO MAKE ME
THESE GREAT MIX CDs--

06:38.917 --> 06:40.667
DR. FREEDMAN.

06:40.709 --> 06:43.000
IT'S ME, JUSTIN.

06:52.083 --> 06:54.667
I BROUGHT YOU
THIS PLAYLIST.
OH, YEAH?

06:54.709 --> 06:56.458
ALL SICK INDIE BANDS,

06:56.500 --> 06:58.041
INCLUDING DEATH FINGER'S
NEW TRACK.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.709
AWESOME. THANK YOU.
HEY, HOW'D YOU GET HERE?

07:00.750 --> 07:03.041
I TOOK THE BUS.

07:03.083 --> 07:05.417
AND YOUR PARENTS,
DO THEY KNOW YOU'RE HERE?

07:05.458 --> 07:08.458
I-I DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER THEM.
THEY'RE BUSY, YOU KNOW, AT WORK.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.959
OKAY, OKAY.
(inhales deeply)

07:11.000 --> 07:12.500
JUSTIN, I'M CONCERNED

07:12.542 --> 07:14.500
BECAUSE YOU'VE GAINED
A LOT OF WEIGHT

07:14.542 --> 07:17.500
SINCE THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU--
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WEIGHT.

07:17.542 --> 07:19.500
I KNOW.
I KEEP GETTING BIGGER,

07:19.542 --> 07:21.500
AND IT'S GOTTEN HARDER
TO GET AROUND,

07:21.542 --> 07:23.500
LIKE, A LOT HARDER
JUST RECENTLY.

07:23.542 --> 07:26.542
OKAY. CAN YOU
GET ON THE SCALE FOR ME?

07:26.583 --> 07:30.000
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

07:35.083 --> 07:36.709
(grunts)

07:36.750 --> 07:38.125
(exhales)

07:42.291 --> 07:44.709
(scale squeaks)

07:50.291 --> 07:52.500
HOW MUCH?

07:52.542 --> 07:55.583
YOU'VE GAINED 282 POUNDS.

07:55.625 --> 07:57.375
OH, MAN.

07:57.417 --> 07:59.375
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

07:59.417 --> 08:03.500
WE JUST NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT,
OKAY? COME ON.

08:03.542 --> 08:05.500
AND HOW MANY WEEKS ALONG
ARE YOU?

08:05.542 --> 08:07.041
UH, EIGHT MONTHS MAYBE.

08:07.083 --> 08:09.709
HOW MANY WEEKS IS THAT?
I'M NOT SO GOOD WITH MATH.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.291
OR PRENATAL CARE.

08:11.333 --> 08:14.375
ARE YOU TAKING ANY
PRENATAL VITAMINS THIS TIME?

08:14.417 --> 08:17.041
GETTING EXAMS AT ANY OF THOSE
FREE CLINICS WE TOLD YOU ABOUT?

08:17.083 --> 08:20.959
I'VE BEEN BUSY.
THE ULTRASOUND PUTS THE BABY
AT 37 WEEKS.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.083
HEARTBEAT'S STRONG.

08:23.125 --> 08:25.792
BUT YOUR PRESSURE IS STILL
A LITTLE ON THE HIGH SIDE,

08:25.834 --> 08:28.208
SO I'D LIKE TO KEEP YOU
OVERNIGHT FOR OBSERVATION.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.709
BECAUSE THE BABY IS BREECH,

08:29.750 --> 08:32.583
WE'LL HAVE TO DO
A C-SECTION TOMORROW.
OKAY.

08:32.625 --> 08:35.041
LOOKS LIKE YOU GET THREE HOTS
AND A COT THIS TIME, EMILY.

08:35.083 --> 08:37.291
SO I WILL TELL DR. KING
TO HOLD OFF D.C.F.S.

08:37.333 --> 08:40.333
FOR PICKING UP THE BABY
TILL TOMORROW.
NO. I DON'T WANT
D.C.F.S. TO COME.

08:40.375 --> 08:43.041
I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO DO THAT.

08:43.083 --> 08:45.375
LOOK, THOSE OTHER TIMES,
I WAS AN ADDICT.

08:45.417 --> 08:47.834
I-I DIDN'T HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE.
I HAD ISSUES.
(laughs) YOU HAD ISSUES?

08:47.875 --> 08:49.834
YOU CAN'T TAKE AWAY
THIS BABY.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.792
I GOT CLEAN A MONTH OR TWO
BEFORE I EVEN GOT KNOCKED UP,

08:52.834 --> 08:55.750
AND--AND I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO QUIT SMOKING.

08:55.792 --> 08:57.750
I SWEAR.
DO ANY DRUG TEST YOU WANT.

08:57.792 --> 09:00.041
LOOK, THIS BABY, IT'S GONNA BE
HEALTHY, AND I WANT TO KEEP IT.

09:00.083 --> 09:02.667
EMILY,
THAT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
PLEASE.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.667
I WANT TO KEEP THIS BABY.

09:04.709 --> 09:07.375
DR. MONTGOMERY, PLEASE DON'T
LET HER TAKE AWAY MY BABY.

09:07.417 --> 09:10.625
NO ONE IS GONNA TAKE AWAY
YOUR BABY. OKAY?

09:10.667 --> 09:14.208
I'M GONNA HELP YOU.

09:22.667 --> 09:25.041
HELLO, MR. AND MRS. TAYLOR.

09:25.083 --> 09:27.458
I'M DR. BENNETT.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.625
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT HE IS THIS FAT?

09:30.667 --> 09:32.500
(Naomi) UH, WELL, WE--
WE ARE CONCERNED.

09:32.542 --> 09:36.417
JUSTIN IS DIABETIC,
AND HE HAS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

09:36.458 --> 09:38.166
AND THAT PUTS HIM AT RISK

09:38.208 --> 09:40.709
FOR EVEN MORE
SERIOUS MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.625
HE'S LAZY AND HE DOESN'T
WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT.

09:42.667 --> 09:45.166
I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER
WHAT HE DOES OR DOESN'T DO.

09:45.208 --> 09:47.875
YOU'RE HIS PARENTS.
THAT'S YOUR JOB.

09:47.917 --> 09:49.834
WHAT DR. FREEDMAN MEANS
IS THAT

09:49.875 --> 09:52.709
JUSTIN NEEDS PROPER NUTRITION
AND EXERCISE

09:52.750 --> 09:56.083
AND MEDICATION COMPLIANCE
TO GET HIS HEALTH BACK ON TRACK.

09:56.125 --> 09:58.333
WE SENT HIM TO FAT CAMP,
WE HIRED A NUTRITIONIST,

09:58.375 --> 10:00.625
AND WE GOT HIM A TRAINER.

10:00.667 --> 10:04.709
COULD IT BE A THYROID CONDITION
OR A TUMOR ON SOME GLAND?

10:04.750 --> 10:06.709
WE RAN TESTS AND RULED OUT

10:06.750 --> 10:08.834
ANY UNDERLYING CAUSES
FOR THE WEIGHT GAIN.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.041
I DON'T WANT
TO GET ANY BIGGER.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.542
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.333
(Mr. Taylor) HE SNEAKS FOOD.

10:14.375 --> 10:16.667
I FIND CANDY WRAPPERS
UNDER YOUR BED ALL THE TIME.

10:16.709 --> 10:19.041
HE'S TRYING, BRUCE.
(Cooper) LOOK,
COULD WE JUST STOP

10:19.083 --> 10:21.625
AND TRY TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE?
ARE YOU STILL
GONNA BE SAYING THAT

10:21.667 --> 10:24.041
WHEN HE'S 600 POUNDS,
DR. FREEDMAN?

10:24.083 --> 10:26.333
I MEAN, I-I'D PUT A LOCK
ON THE FRIDGE

10:26.375 --> 10:29.875
IF I DIDN'T THINK
HE'D EAT IT OFF.
JUSTIN?

10:29.917 --> 10:33.250
ARE YOU OKAY?
I FEEL A LITTLE DIZZY.

10:33.291 --> 10:35.041
JUSTIN.

10:35.083 --> 10:36.542
(exhales)
JUSTIN!

10:38.750 --> 10:40.875
(Cooper)
HIS PULSE IS SKY HIGH.

10:40.917 --> 10:43.041
YEAH.
I'LL GET OXYGEN.

10:43.083 --> 10:44.583
OKAY.
(beeps)

10:44.625 --> 10:47.083
GET ME AN I.V. CART
AND CALL AN AMBULANCE, PLEASE.

10:47.125 --> 10:48.709
HERE.

10:50.208 --> 10:52.667
PEOPLE CAN CHANGE, VIOLET.
I KNOW YOU BELIEVE THAT.

10:52.709 --> 10:55.625
WHY NOT EMILY?
WE HAVE TRIED, ADDISON,
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

10:55.667 --> 10:58.166
BUT IT WON'T TAKE
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT IT TO.

10:58.208 --> 11:00.959
TEN MINUTES AFTER I GET HER
CLEAN, SHE GOES OUT TO SCORE.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.083
I-I BEG A SHELTER
TO FIND A BED FOR HER,

11:03.125 --> 11:06.041
AND SHE NEVER SHOWS UP.
THE BEST THING WOULD BE
IF SHE STOPPED

11:06.083 --> 11:08.041
HAVING BABIES ALTOGETHER.
WE SHOULD TIE HER TUBES.

11:08.083 --> 11:11.000
YOU'RE DOING HER C-SECTION
TOMORROW. YOU COULD DO IT THEN.

11:11.041 --> 11:14.000
I AM NOT GONNA STERILIZE A WOMAN
WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.542
I NEED HER CONSENT.
WELL, IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO KEEP HER

11:16.583 --> 11:19.041
FROM COMING BACK PREGNANT
IN A YEAR.
OKAY, OKAY, LOOK,
EMILY IS A DISASTER.

11:19.083 --> 11:21.041
NO ONE WANTS TO SEE
HER COMING BACK PREGNANT,

11:21.083 --> 11:23.041
BUT ADDISON IS RIGHT.

11:23.083 --> 11:26.041
SHE HAS TO SIGN OFF
ON THE STERILIZATION.
JUST BECAUSE EMILY'S MADE
BAD DECISIONS

11:26.083 --> 11:29.333
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE TAKE AWAY
HER RIGHT TO HAVE CHILDREN.
WHY ARE WE ONLY
DISCUSSING HER RIGHTS?

11:29.375 --> 11:31.542
WHAT ABOUT DAVID'S RIGHTS?
WHO'S DAVID?

11:31.583 --> 11:33.041
HER FIRSTBORN.
EIGHT WEEKS PREMATURE.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.583
HE WENT BLIND
FROM BEING ON A VENTILATOR.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.583
HE'S BEEN IN SEVEN HOMES
IN SIX YEARS.

11:37.625 --> 11:40.208
TURNS OUT HE'S NOT ONLY BLIND.
HE'S AUTISTIC.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.667
BRAD WAS SECOND.

11:41.709 --> 11:43.667
HE'S SEVERELY DISABLED
DUE TO FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME.

11:43.709 --> 11:45.667
HE'S IN A HOME
FOR SPECIAL NEEDS KIDS.

11:45.709 --> 11:48.750
THEN THERE'S APRIL, WHO'S--WELL,
SHE'S STILL IN FOSTER CARE,

11:48.792 --> 11:50.959
'CAUSE WHO WANTS A CRACK BABY?
AND THEN... (sighs)

11:51.000 --> 11:52.458
THERE'S DANIEL,

11:52.500 --> 11:55.041
WHO SURVIVED FOR 16
EXCRUCIATING DAYS IN N.I.C.U.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.667
BEFORE HE SUCCUMBED
TO SHORT BOWEL SYNDROME.

11:57.709 --> 12:00.000
I SIGNED
HIS DEATH CERTIFICATE MYSELF.
YOU THINK SHE WANTS
THIS BABY?

12:00.041 --> 12:02.834
SHE DOESN'T WANT THIS BABY.
SHE HAS AN ANGLE.

12:02.875 --> 12:06.041
SHE ALWAYS HAS AN ANGLE.
SHE'S NOT GONNA CHANGE,
ADDISON. TIE HER TUBES.

12:06.083 --> 12:08.041
WITHOUT HER CONSENT, I CAN'T.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.542
I'M SORRY.
I WON'T DO IT.

12:12.667 --> 12:14.208
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

12:14.250 --> 12:16.625
JUSTIN. HOW IS HE?

12:16.667 --> 12:18.875
UM, HIS BLOOD SUGAR SPIKED,

12:18.917 --> 12:20.583
WHICH CAUSED
PROFOUND DEHYDRATION

12:20.625 --> 12:22.041
AND ELECTROLYTE
ABNORMALITIES.

12:22.083 --> 12:24.625
HE'S GONNA WAKE UP, RIGHT?
UH, WELL, YEAH. HE'S--

12:24.667 --> 12:28.166
HE'S A LITTLE BIT DISORIENTED
AND CONFUSED, BUT HE SHOULD

12:28.208 --> 12:30.625
RESPOND TO TREATMENT
WITHIN THE NEXT 12 HOURS.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.250
WE'RE GONNA BRING DOWN
HIS BLOOD SUGAR, BUT SLOWLY.
(Mrs. Taylor)
BUT HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

12:33.291 --> 12:36.667
I MEAN, HE'S NOT GONNA DIE.
(Cooper) WELL, THAT DEPENDS
ON WHAT YOU'RE WILLING TO DO.

12:36.709 --> 12:39.041
HE'S A TEENAGER WITH THE HEALTH
OF A 70 YEAR OLD.

12:39.083 --> 12:40.875
HE COULD STROKE OUT
AT ANY MINUTE.

12:40.917 --> 12:43.333
HE'S AT RISK
FOR A HEART ATTACK.
(Bruce)
YOU CODDLE HIM TOO MUCH.

12:43.375 --> 12:45.041
YOU ALWAYS HAVE.
I LOVE HIM.

12:45.083 --> 12:47.667
I'M NOT LIKE YOU--

12:47.709 --> 12:49.750
THE WAY YOU LOOK AT HIM
WITH SUCH DISGUST.

12:49.792 --> 12:52.083
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU THINK
THAT MAKES HIM FEEL?

12:52.125 --> 12:55.208
OF COURSE HE EATS.
HE NEEDS COMFORT.
WHAT HE NEEDS IS DISCIPLINE.

12:55.250 --> 12:58.667
YOU MAKE HIM THINK IT'S OKAY
TO INHALE ALL THE CRAP HE WANTS.
OKAY, WHY DON'T--

12:58.709 --> 13:00.750
WHY DON'T WE GO INTO THE LOUNGE
AND DISCUSS THIS?

13:00.792 --> 13:03.041
I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.709
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
AROUND MY BABY.

13:06.750 --> 13:09.667
I'M GOING BACK TO WORK.
YOU'RE LEAVING?

13:09.709 --> 13:11.500
(footsteps retreat)

13:11.542 --> 13:14.583
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

13:14.625 --> 13:17.625
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

13:19.542 --> 13:22.125
HEY. IS EVERYTHING OKAY HERE?

13:22.166 --> 13:25.542
YEAH. I WAS JUST
CHECKING UP ON EMILY.

13:25.583 --> 13:27.750
YOUR TOX SCREENS
CAME BACK NEGATIVE,

13:27.792 --> 13:29.750
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY S.T.D.s.

13:29.792 --> 13:32.041
I TOLD YOU
THIS BABY WAS HEALTHY.

13:32.083 --> 13:34.750
I'VE BEEN THINKING,
AFTER THE DELIVERY,

13:34.792 --> 13:37.041
YOU SHOULD TIE MY TUBES.

13:37.083 --> 13:40.166
DID YOU COME UP WITH THAT IDEA
ON YOUR OWN?

13:40.208 --> 13:42.917
I'VE JUST BEEN GOING OVER
THE BASICS, THE ANATOMY--

13:42.959 --> 13:45.917
DID HE ALSO EXPLAIN THAT
THIS IS A PERMANENT CHOICE?

13:45.959 --> 13:49.417
THAT'S THE POINT, RIGHT?
EMILY, THERE ARE OTHER FORMS
OF BIRTH CONTROL THAT

13:49.458 --> 13:52.625
WOULD PRESERVE THE OPTION OF
HAVING CHILDREN IN THE FUTURE.
(pager beeps)

13:52.667 --> 13:54.625
WE WENT OVER
ALL THE OPTIONS.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.041
THIS IS HER DECISION.

13:56.083 --> 13:59.500
SORRY. I HAVE TO GET BACK
TO THE E.R.

13:59.542 --> 14:01.583
(door opens)

14:01.625 --> 14:03.583
IF HE PRESSURED YOU
IN ANY WAY, I--

14:03.625 --> 14:05.125
HE DIDN'T.
(door closes)

14:05.166 --> 14:07.041
WHAT HE SAID MAKES SENSE.

14:07.083 --> 14:11.041
AND I WANT TO GIVE THIS BABY
AND ME THE BEST POSSIBLE SHOT.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.750
SO DO IT, DR. MONTGOMERY.

14:13.792 --> 14:17.458
TIE MY TUBES.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.959
YOU THINK PETE BRIBED HER?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO
WITH EMILY.

14:24.041 --> 14:26.000
THEY GIVE HER MONEY TO GET HER
TO DO WHAT THEY WANT.
WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY
OF HELPING.

14:26.041 --> 14:28.000
WHAT, YOU THINK
SHE SHOULD KEEP THE BABY?

14:28.041 --> 14:30.166
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK
THAT SHE WANTS TO CHANGE?

14:30.208 --> 14:33.583
I WOULD LIKE TO HELP EMILY
IMPROVE HER LIFE.
SO YOU THINK PETE, VIOLET,
AND CHARLOTTE COULDN'T,

14:33.625 --> 14:36.583
BUT--BUT YOU CAN?
I'D LIKE TO TRY.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.583
IS THIS FOR YOUR SAKE
OR FOR HERS?

14:39.625 --> 14:42.250
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

14:45.417 --> 14:46.792
W--

14:49.917 --> 14:51.834
WHAT?

14:51.875 --> 14:54.375
I'M SUPPOSED TO FILTER.

14:54.417 --> 14:57.083
OH, JUST SAY IT.
OKAY. THIS IS
THE BABY THING, RIGHT?

14:57.125 --> 15:00.709
SHE TOLD YOU SHE WANTS A BABY,
AND YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,

15:00.750 --> 15:03.625
AND EVEN THOUGH SHE TOLD YOU
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING,

15:03.667 --> 15:07.500
SHE'S MAD THAT YOU DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING, AND SO NOW SH--
AH. FILTER.

15:07.542 --> 15:10.000
I HAVE GOT TO GET
MY OWN LIFE.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.875
(speaks indistinctly)

15:13.917 --> 15:15.041
(sighs)

15:15.083 --> 15:17.625
MY 15-YEAR-OLD PATIENT--
JUSTIN--

15:17.667 --> 15:20.375
GAINED 300 POUNDS
IN 3 YEARS,

15:20.417 --> 15:22.792
AND MOMMY AND DADDY WERE
TOO BUSY TO NOTICE.

15:22.834 --> 15:25.333
SO YOU'RE BLAMING
THE PARENTS?
YOU WOULDN'T?

15:25.375 --> 15:27.625
WELL, IN ALL FAIRNESS,
JUSTIN IS THE ONE

15:27.667 --> 15:30.417
PUTTING THE FOOD IN HIS MOUTH.
WELL, NO, I GET
THAT HE'S EATING,

15:30.458 --> 15:33.750
BUT THE PARENTS
LET IT GET TOO FAR.
(Violet and Sheldon) SO DID HE.

15:33.792 --> 15:35.625
WHOA.

15:35.667 --> 15:37.750
SHRINK MIND MELD.
CREEPY.

15:37.792 --> 15:40.041
GIVE ME BACK MY FRIES.
COME ON. COME ON. COME ON.
HEY, THERE SHE IS.
THERE SHE IS. HI.

15:40.083 --> 15:42.667
OH, HEY. HEY.
OH, HEY.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.667
HOW'S SHE DOING?

15:44.709 --> 15:46.750
SWEETIE.

15:46.792 --> 15:49.542
YEAH.

15:49.583 --> 15:51.667
HEY. HOW YOU DOING?

15:51.709 --> 15:53.667
OH, FIRST DAY
OF THE REST OF MY LIFE.

15:53.709 --> 15:55.041
FEEL GOOD?

15:55.083 --> 15:57.667
WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU
MAKES YOU STRONGER.

16:00.667 --> 16:03.041
YOU SAW THAT, RIGHT?
IT'S NOT JUST ME? YOU SAW THAT?

16:03.083 --> 16:05.041
THE CLICHéS--
SHE ONLY SPEAKS IN CLICHéS.

16:05.083 --> 16:07.500
SHE'S GOT A MILLION OF 'EM.
AND THE SMILEY THING?

16:07.542 --> 16:09.041
WELL, SHE'S CERTAINLY...
CHIPPER.

16:09.083 --> 16:11.542
BUT CHARLOTTE'S NOT
A SMILEY PERSON.
EXACTLY.

16:11.583 --> 16:13.583
WELL, IT'S A--IT'S
A COPING MECHANISM, COOP.

16:13.625 --> 16:15.959
OKAY, BUT SHE'S NOT COPING.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.500
WHAT DO I DO?

16:17.542 --> 16:20.000
(fries rustle against paper)

16:20.041 --> 16:22.542
MM-HMM. WHERE'S
YOUR MIND MELD NOW, BITCHES?

16:22.583 --> 16:24.583
(crunches)

16:24.625 --> 16:28.583
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY EMILY
TO GET HER TUBES TIED?

16:28.625 --> 16:33.000
SHE SAID YES TO $250.
I WOULD'VE GONE HIGHER.

16:33.041 --> 16:35.959
PETE, COMPLETELY UNETHICAL.
THERE ARE NONPROFITS
IN ALL 50 STATES

16:36.000 --> 16:38.041
OFFERING DRUG-ADDICTED WOMEN
FINANCIAL INCENTIVES

16:38.083 --> 16:41.041
TO HAVE THEIR TUBES TIED.
YEAH, BUT WE DON'T WORK
FOR THOSE ORGANIZATIONS.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.542
WE'RE DOCTORS.
AND THERE ARE THREE MILLION
CASES OF CHILD ABUSE A YEAR.

16:43.583 --> 16:46.041
DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE

16:46.083 --> 16:48.041
ARE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR
IN MOST OF THEM.

16:48.083 --> 16:50.792
USUALLY YOU'RE MORE PRACTICAL
THAN THIS.
EMILY ISN'T JUST
SOME STATISTIC.

16:50.834 --> 16:53.542
SHE'S A WOMAN, OKAY, WHO COULD
WAKE UP TEN YEARS FROM NOW,

16:53.583 --> 16:55.083
STILL CLEAN AND SOBER,

16:55.125 --> 16:57.709
AND WISH THAT SHE COULD
HAVE ANOTHER CHILD.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.417
OKAY, LOOK, I FULLY RECOGNIZE

16:59.458 --> 17:01.917
THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS
UNETHICAL, POSSIBLY ILLEGAL.

17:01.959 --> 17:04.834
I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT YOU
KNOW ME. YOU KNOW VIOLET.

17:04.875 --> 17:06.792
SHE'S THE ONE
THAT CAN'T STOP HERSELF

17:06.834 --> 17:10.333
FROM HELPING CRIMINALS,
PEDOPHILES, YOU NAME IT.

17:10.375 --> 17:13.041
IF THE TWO OF US ARE SAYING
THAT EMILY IS A LOST CAUSE,

17:13.083 --> 17:15.041
DOESN'T THAT
TELL YOU SOMETHING?

17:16.917 --> 17:20.583
(women speaking indistinctly)

17:20.625 --> 17:22.125
YES.
(Violet) HI.

17:22.166 --> 17:25.041
HI, BABY.
(speaking gibberish)

17:25.083 --> 17:27.041
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THIS WAS A PLAY DATE.

17:27.083 --> 17:29.041
OH, I GAVE MAYA
THE NIGHT OFF.

17:29.083 --> 17:31.041
(baby talk voice) AREN'T YOU?
YOU'RE SO SMART.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.750
SHE IS SUPER SMART.

17:32.792 --> 17:34.417
(inhales and speaks gibberish)

17:34.458 --> 17:36.250
YES. YES, YOU'RE SO SMART.

17:36.291 --> 17:39.041
(all laugh)
ARE YOU TIRED, TOO?
A LITTLE--

17:39.083 --> 17:41.041
WELL, IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
RUN THE WORLD SOMEDAY.

17:41.083 --> 17:43.375
I KNOW.
IT'S TRUE.

17:43.417 --> 17:46.041
(Violet) ALL RIGHT, IT'S MY
TURN. MY TURN, MY TURN, MY TURN.

17:46.083 --> 17:48.667
(Addison)
THAT'S YOUR AUNTIE VI. YEAH.
(baby talk voice) OH, I MISS
LUCAS BEING THIS LITTLE.

17:48.709 --> 17:50.792
IS CHARLOTTE COMING?
(normal voice) NO.
SHE DECLINED, BUT GRACEFULLY.

17:50.834 --> 17:53.166
YES, SHE'S SPEAKING
IN BUMPER STICKER SLOGANS,

17:53.208 --> 17:55.041
WHICH EITHER MEANS
SHE'S INTERNALIZED

17:55.083 --> 17:57.583
THE HELP
THAT WE'VE BEEN OFFERING HER...
OR WE NEED START

17:57.625 --> 18:00.041
PLANNING ESCAPE ROUTES
IN CASE SHE GOES POSTAL.

18:00.083 --> 18:02.208
OKAY, OKAY, MY TURN AGAIN.
COME ON.
ALL RIGHT.

18:02.250 --> 18:05.500
(speaks gibberish, baby talk
voice) YES, THE SWEETEST GIRL.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.375
HI. HI.
HI. THERE YOU ARE.
THERE YOU ARE.

18:08.417 --> 18:10.667
HI, SWEETIE.
OH, SHE IS SO GORGEOUS.

18:10.709 --> 18:15.291
YES, YOU ARE.
YOU ARE GORGEOUS, LITTLE GIRL.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.875
(laughing)

18:16.917 --> 18:18.667
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

18:18.709 --> 18:20.667
(Violet, normal voice)
WHERE YOU GOING?
NO OFFENSE,

18:20.709 --> 18:22.917
BUT I DID NOT COME HERE
FOR "THE VAGINA MONOLOGUES."

18:22.959 --> 18:25.500
(Addison) WHAT?
WHAT?

18:25.542 --> 18:27.542
(laughs)
(laughing) OH, NOT
"THE VAGINA MONOLOGUES."

18:27.583 --> 18:30.250
