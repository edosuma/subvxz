us. One of us, at any rate.

16:08.130 --> 16:10.570
It was treason. I warned them.

16:11.230 --> 16:13.800
Robert has two sons
and Renly has an older brother.

16:14.300 --> 16:18.580
How can he possibly have any
claim to that ugly iron chair?

16:18.670 --> 16:21.810
We should have stayed
well out of all this if you ask me.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.860
But once the cow's been milked, there's no

16:23.980 --> 16:25.920
squirting the cream back up her udders.

16:26.010 --> 16:28.420
So here we are to see things through.

16:28.510 --> 16:30.550
What do you say to that, Sansa?

16:31.480 --> 16:33.660
Shall we have some lemon cakes?

16:34.490 --> 16:36.090
Lemon cake's my favorite.

16:36.220 --> 16:37.830
So we've been told.

16:37.890 --> 16:39.370
Are you going to bring the food

16:39.490 --> 16:40.990
or do you mean to starve us to death?

16:42.200 --> 16:45.670
Here, Sansa, come sit with me.

16:46.770 --> 16:50.180
I'm much less boring than these others.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.410
Do you know my son?

16:54.510 --> 16:56.420
The Lord of Highgarden?

16:56.510 --> 16:58.580
I haven! had the pleasure.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.350
Mmm. No great
pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf.

17:02.220 --> 17:06.859
His father was an oaf
as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.869
He managed to ride off a
cliff whilst hawking.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.240
They say he was looking up at the sky

17:12.290 --> 17:15.760
and paying no mind
to where his horse was taking him.

17:15.859 --> 17:17.640
And now my son is doing the same,

17:17.730 --> 17:21.270
only this time
he's riding a lion instead of a horse.

17:21.530 --> 17:23.950
Now...

17:24.040 --> 17:26.710
I want you to tell me the truth

17:26.810 --> 17:29.450
about this royal boy, this Jeffrey.

17:30.710 --> 17:32.450
I... I...

17:32.550 --> 17:35.720
You, you. Who else would know better?

17:36.050 --> 17:41.290
We've heard some troubling tales.
ls there any truth to them?

17:41.390 --> 17:45.460
Has this boy mistreated you?
Has he ripped out your tongue?

17:46.730 --> 17:52.970
(STAMMERS) King Jeffrey,
His Grace is very fair and handsome

17:53.070 --> 17:54.670
and as brave as a lion.

17:54.770 --> 17:57.810
Yes, all Lannisters are lions.

17:57.900 --> 18:00.650
And when a Tyrell fans,
it smells like a rose.

18:01.770 --> 18:03.750
But how kind is he? How clever?

18:04.080 --> 18:06.080
Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?

18:06.150 --> 18:09.620
I'm to be his wife.
I only want to know what that means.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.090
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

18:17.990 --> 18:19.300
Bring me some cheese.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.500
Cheese will be served
after the cakes, my lady.

18:21.590 --> 18:23.940
The cheese will be served
when I want it served.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.340
I want it served now.

18:29.670 --> 18:32.980
Are you frightened, child?
No need for that.

18:33.810 --> 18:38.720
We're only women here. Tell us the truth.
No harm will come to you.

18:40.310 --> 18:42.520
My father always told the truth.

18:42.620 --> 18:47.460
Yes, he had that reputation. And they
named him traitor and took his head.

18:47.520 --> 18:48.560
Joffrey.

18:50.790 --> 18:52.530
Joffrey did that.

18:52.630 --> 18:54.300
He promised he would be merciful

18:54.460 --> 18:56.130
and he cut my father's head off.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.800
And he said that was mercy.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.900
Then he took me
up on the walls and made me look at it.

19:05.470 --> 19:06.470
Go on.

19:08.980 --> 19:11.720
I can't. I never meant...

19:12.210 --> 19:14.020
My father was a traitor.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.060
My brother as well. I have traitors blood.

19:16.180 --> 19:18.180
Please don't make me say any more.

19:18.250 --> 19:20.560
She's terrified, Grandmother. Look at her.

19:21.350 --> 19:23.060
Speak freely, child.

19:23.490 --> 19:26.490
We would never
betray your confidence, I swear it.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.200
He's a monster.

19:33.170 --> 19:34.170
Ah.

19:35.670 --> 19:36.700
That's a pity.

19:36.770 --> 19:38.840
Please, don't stop the wedding.

19:38.910 --> 19:41.680
Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden

19:41.840 --> 19:44.580
is determined that Margaery shall be queen.

19:45.180 --> 19:48.390
Even so, we thank you for the truth.

19:48.450 --> 19:49.450
Ah.

BB: My grandfather's
funeral is not a distraction.

20:14.410 --> 20:15.650
Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?

20:15.780 --> 20:17.050
No.

My Uncle Edmure
has his forces garrisoned there.

20:22.450 --> 20:24.260

20:24.380 --> 20:26.390
Unless he's been breeding them,

20:26.550 --> 20:28.550
he don't have enough to make a difference.

20:29.220 --> 20:31.290
Have you lost faith in our cause?

20:31.720 --> 20:34.900
If it's revenge, I still got faith in it.

20:35.260 --> 20:36.470
If you no longer believe...

20:36.560 --> 20:38.600
I can believe till it snows in Dome.

20:39.600 --> 20:43.240
Don't change the fact
that we've got half the men.

20:44.970 --> 20:47.650
You don't think we can win?

20:47.740 --> 20:49.580
May I speak my mind, Your Grace?

speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?

You're afraid of her.

I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...

21:34.690 --> 21:36.860
You can't help because a mother

21:36.990 --> 21:39.200
makes one for her children to protect them.

21:41.390 --> 21:43.530
Only a mother can make them.

21:50.140 --> 21:51.140
You've made them before?

21:53.970 --> 21:55.650
Twice.

21:56.840 --> 21:57.880
Did they work?

22:00.650 --> 22:02.490
After a fashion.

22:04.680 --> 22:08.430
I prayed for my son Bran
to survive his fall.

22:12.990 --> 22:17.070
Many years before that,
one of the boys came down with the pox.

22:18.330 --> 22:21.370
Maester Luwin said
if he made it through the night, he'd live.

22:22.240 --> 22:25.840
But it would be a very long night.

22:27.610 --> 22:30.920
So I sat with him all through the darkness.

22:32.010 --> 22:35.460
Listened to his ragged little breaths.

22:35.550 --> 22:38.360
His coughing, his whimpering.

22:38.450 --> 22:40.120
Which boy?

22:41.390 --> 22:43.260
Jon Snow.

22:46.130 --> 22:51.600
When my husband brought that baby home from
the war, I couldn't bear to look at him.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.730
I didn't want to see those brown

22:53.870 --> 22:55.970
strangers eyes staring up at me.

22:56.700 --> 23:01.880
So I prayed to the Gods,
take him away. Make him die.

23:04.310 --> 23:05.620
He got the pox.

23:09.080 --> 23:13.220
And I knew I was
the worst woman who ever lived.

23:15.050 --> 23:17.090
A murderer.

23:18.620 --> 23:23.800
I'd condemned this poor,
innocent child to a horrible death

23:23.900 --> 23:26.070
all because I was jealous of his mother.

23:27.230 --> 23:29.680
A woman he didn't even know.

23:30.140 --> 23:32.910
So I prayed to all seven Gods,

23:33.740 --> 23:36.350
let the boy live.

23:36.440 --> 23:41.120
Let him live and I'll love him.

23:41.180 --> 23:44.130
I'll be a mother to him.

23:44.180 --> 23:48.000
I'll beg my husband to
give him a true name,

23:48.090 --> 23:50.620
to call him Stark and be done with it,

23:51.090 --> 23:52.430
to make him one of us.

23:52.490 --> 23:56.770
And he lived.

23:59.530 --> 24:01.770
And I couldn't keep my promise.

24:06.440 --> 24:09.280
And everything that's happened since then,

24:10.880 --> 24:14.150
all this horror that's come to my family,

24:16.450 --> 24:20.300
it's all because I couldn't
love a motherless child.

24:30.660 --> 24:33.300
Was it hard for you to kill the Half hand?

24:35.630 --> 24:37.050
Yes.

24:37.140 --> 24:39.240
You liked him?

24:39.910 --> 24:41.890
I like you, but if you're playing us false,

24:42.010 --> 24:44.010
it won't be hard for me to kill you.

24:49.050 --> 24:52.220
Well, how could you understand?

24:52.320 --> 24:54.260
You want to protect your people.

24:55.050 --> 24:57.360
Do you know what it takes
to unite 90 clans,

24:57.420 --> 25:02.200
half of whom want to massacre the other
half for one insult or another?

25:02.260 --> 25:05.900
They speak seven
different languages in my army.

25:06.170 --> 25:09.910
The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The
Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans.

25:10.540 --> 25:12.740

was give him the names. Anyone.

You could have picked Tywin Lannister.

of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?

32:29.680 --> 32:30.680

32:30.780 --> 32:33.380
We should have come
to the Red Fork River by now.

32:33.480 --> 32:34.620
Maybe we passed it.

32:35.850 --> 32:39.350
It's 100 feet wide.
How could we have passed it?

32:40.650 --> 32:43.530

we can follow it west to Riverrun.

37:44.820 --> 37:47.270

37:49.930 --> 37:51.460
That Sansa shouldn't trust him.

drink, he suggested something...

You're a warg.

46:56.540 --> 47:00.320
It's not just wolves.
Sometimes in my dreams there's a...

47:00.380 --> 47:01.720
A three-eyed raven?

47:01.850 --> 47:03.220
You've seen it?

47:03.310 --> 47:05.520
We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?

47:06.250 --> 47:08.230
Does it have anything to do with warging?

47:08.320 --> 47:12.170
No, the raven is
something different, something deeper.

47:13.830 --> 47:14.910
The raven brings the sight.

47:15.690 --> 47:18.070
Seeing things that haven't happened yet?

47:18.160 --> 47:20.230
Or things that happened
long before you were born

47:20.330 --> 47:23.740
or things that are happening right
now thousands of miles away.

47:24.670 --> 47:26.410
What's he telling him?

47:26.500 --> 47:28.610
Why don't you ask?

47:30.070 --> 47:33.420
Isn't he ashamed,
your brother, needing you to protect him?

47:34.750 --> 47:36.520
Where's the shame in that?

47:36.880 --> 47:40.290
Any boy his age who needs
his sister to protect him

47:40.380 --> 47:43.730
is gonna find himself
needing lots of protecting.

47:45.260 --> 47:47.740
Some people will always need help.

47:48.760 --> 47:51.040
That doesn't mean they're
not worth helping.

47:54.700 --> 47:57.910
When my father died, I dreamt it.

47:59.270 --> 48:03.950
You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.

48:04.040 --> 48:05.210
You have the sight, too?

48:08.650 --> 48:12.750
When I told my father about your father,

48:13.820 --> 48:16.960
for the first time in
my life, I saw him cry.

48:17.050 --> 48:18.830
Your father is Howland Reed?

48:19.120 --> 48:20.570
Yeah.

48:20.630 --> 48:23.730
He saved my fathers life
during the rebellion.

48:23.800 --> 48:26.500
Your father told you about the rebellion?

48:26.630 --> 48:29.410
Mine never did. But I saw that, too.

48:30.400 --> 48:31.740
What else have you seen?

48:33.340 --> 48:34.910
Only one thing that matters,

48:35.810 --> 48:37.180
you.

48:47.820 --> 48:51.460
THOROS: I never liked the skinny ones.
Like drinking from a puddle.

48:51.920 --> 48:54.930
Not that I'm averse to
drinking from a puddle every now and again.

48:54.990 --> 48:56.670
I don't drink ale.

48:56.760 --> 48:59.710
There's no story so good
a drink won't make it better.

48:59.800 --> 49:01.440
- Yeah!
- You see?

49:01.700 --> 49:03.770
They've suffered through my bouts of

49:03.870 --> 49:05.940
sobriety. It's very tedious
for all concerned.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.610
Now, how did three children...

49:07.770 --> 49:09.380
We're not children.

49:10.310 --> 49:12.690
How did three young persons
such as yourselves,

49:12.780 --> 49:16.880
untrained in the an of war,
escape from Harrenhal?

49:19.780 --> 49:23.200
Gendry's a smith.
He was apprenticed in the armory.

49:23.320 --> 49:25.730
A smith, eh? Where'd you train?

49:29.790 --> 49:31.970
King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.

49:32.030 --> 49:34.010
That criminal. He charges mice as much

49:34.130 --> 49:36.130
as every other armorer in the city.

49:36.200 --> 49:38.150
- That's because he's mice as good.
- Ah-ha!

49:39.140 --> 49:40.510
A smith and a salesman.

49:41.470 --> 49:43.040
- Gendry stole us weapons.
- Ah!

49:44.240 --> 49:46.380
Fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see.

49:47.140 --> 49:49.390
He knows how to use a sword and so do I.

49:49.650 --> 49:51.150
(ALL LAUGHING)

49:52.050 --> 49:53.260
My brothers taught me.

49:53.350 --> 49:54.760
(ALL LAUGHING)

49:57.660 --> 49:59.500
MEN: Ooh!

50:04.760 --> 50:06.370
(ALL CHEERING)

50:14.510 --> 50:15.880
To your brothers!

50:15.940 --> 50:17.350
(ALL CHEERING)

50:24.520 --> 50:26.360
You can finish your meals before you go.

50:26.520 --> 50:28.360
It may be awhile before you see another.

50:29.190 --> 50:30.600
You'll free us?

50:30.720 --> 50:32.200
I gave you my word.

50:34.890 --> 50:36.700
But before you go,

50:37.230 --> 50:39.870
allow me to raise a cup to your...

50:39.930 --> 50:41.810
- Hey, hey.
- (LAUGHING)

50:42.770 --> 50:45.300
Now that is an uncommonly large person.

50:45.400 --> 50:48.780
How does one manage to subdue
such an uncommonly large person?

50:48.870 --> 50:51.410
One waits for him to drink
until he passes out.

50:51.480 --> 50:54.080
Poor man. You have my sympathy.

50:56.050 --> 50:57.420
Aha!

50:58.050 --> 50:59.790
Not a man at all.

51:00.720 --> 51:02.720
- A Hound!
- (ALL HOWLING)

51:03.590 --> 51:06.120
So good to see you again, Clegane.

51:06.220 --> 51:08.170
Thorns?

51:08.560 --> 51:11.130
The fuck you doing here?

51:11.230 --> 51:12.640
Drinking and talking loo much.
Same as ever.

51:12.760 --> 51:14.170
(ALL CHUCKLING)

51:14.600 --> 51:16.240
THOROS: A pretty prize, lads.

51:16.400 --> 51:18.070
ALL; Yeah!

51:20.570 --> 51:22.240
Girl.

51:23.940 --> 51:27.950
What in seven hells
are you doing with the Stark bitch?

51:39.290 --> 51:41.330
JAIME: It's a tough decision.

51:41.430 --> 51:45.340
Take the bridge and risk being
seen or cross the great water.

51:45.430 --> 51:46.600
BRIENNE: Silence.

51:46.760 --> 51:48.040
Anyone can see us on the bridge,

51:48.300 --> 51:51.180
but cross by water
and the current could take us.

51:51.270 --> 51:53.010
Or I could escape down the river.

51:53.100 --> 51:54.880
Good luck.

51:57.270 --> 52:01.150
It's wonderful to watch you
wrestle with these dilemmas.

52:01.210 --> 52:03.450
Which will she choose?

52:08.390 --> 52:11.630
Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.

52:11.690 --> 52:13.690
Be quick about it.

52:20.360 --> 52:22.070
- Oh, I need to rest.
- Get up.

52:22.170 --> 52:24.700
I have these,
on your feet when you walk too far.

52:24.800 --> 52:26.210
- What do you call them?
- Get up now.

52:26.300 --> 52:28.540
Corns. I never used to gel corns.

52:29.470 --> 52:33.250
I used to ride everywhere,
not march around like a common foot soldier

52:33.340 --> 52:35.690
wearing the same shit
boots for over a year.

52:35.750 --> 52:38.250
This heel is ruined. There's no way...

52:38.350 --> 52:39.560
(GRUNTS)

52:44.190 --> 52:45.530
(CHUCKLES)

52:46.260 --> 52:48.000
I never understood why some knights

52:48.090 --> 52:49.830
felt the need to carry two swords.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.370
(EXHALES)

53:04.580 --> 53:05.580
Ooh!

53:10.510 --> 53:12.430
You move well

53:15.590 --> 53:17.590
for a great beast of a woman.

53:18.390 --> 53:19.530
(GRUNTING)

53:21.790 --> 53:25.710
You shouldn't grimace before you
lunge. It gives away the game.

53:39.980 --> 53:44.150
Bit of a quandary for you.
If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark.

53:45.280 --> 53:47.490
But if you don't kill me,

53:48.290 --> 53:49.630
I'm going to kill you.

53:55.990 --> 53:59.440
You're good. Graceless, but good.

54:09.070 --> 54:12.750
See? If you were willing to hurt
me, you might have had me there.

54:30.290 --> 54:31.770
(GROANS)

54:44.280 --> 54:45.680
- (JAIME PANTING)
- (HORSE NEIGHING)

54:45.810 --> 54:47.450
(HORSES APPROACHING)

54:56.320 --> 54:59.360
Looks like your woman's
getting the better of you,

54:59.460 --> 55:01.330
if you can call that a woman.

55:01.390 --> 55:05.640
We enjoy a good fight.
Gets our juices flowing.

55:06.060 --> 55:10.410
The Flayed Man of House Bolton.
A bit gruesome for my taste.

55:10.500 --> 55:12.810
You sure he's the one?

55:12.870 --> 55:14.510
That's him, all right.

55:14.570 --> 55:17.640
I saw him fight at
the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.

55:19.740 --> 55:21.880
Give the man his silver.

55:23.480 --> 55:26.050
Let us go and
my father will pay you whatever you want.

55:26.580 --> 55:28.330
Enough to buy me a new head?

55:29.320 --> 55:32.230
If the King in the North
hears I let the Kingslayer go,

55:32.320 --> 55:34.930
he'll be taking it right off.

55:35.030 --> 55:36.660
I'd rather he takes yours.
