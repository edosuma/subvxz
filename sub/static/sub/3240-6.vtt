Didn't he tell you
anything about himself?

11:34.227 --> 11:36.428
He was incredibly vague,
as usual.

11:36.430 --> 11:37.696
But he did claim

11:37.698 --> 11:39.130
To be in london during
the original murders.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.498
Wait.
You don't think...?

11:40.500 --> 11:42.634
I don't know
what to think.

11:42.636 --> 11:44.102
I mean,
I know it sounds absurd --

11:44.104 --> 11:48.173
I'm in lucas-land -- but let's
consider it for a moment.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.709
The police never did
catch jack in london.

11:50.711 --> 11:51.876
The body
that we found today --

11:51.878 --> 11:53.344
It's hard to imagine
that a copycat

11:53.346 --> 11:56.481
Could have reproduced that scene
in such precise detail.

11:56.483 --> 12:00.452
I take it you haven't shared
this theory with the police?

12:00.454 --> 12:01.720
Uh, no.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.021
I've had my fair share
of padded white rooms,

12:03.023 --> 12:05.557
Thank you very much.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.025
If adam did this,

12:07.027 --> 12:09.594
I'm afraid we're gonna have to
track him down ourselves.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.296
I'm afraid to ask how.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.064
With this.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.867
It's a shard from
the handle of the murder weapon.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.469
Judging by the cuts
on the victim,

12:17.471 --> 12:19.404
I'd say the killer used
a liston knife.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.272
It's an extremely rare
surgical tool.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.842
There are only about
100 left in existence.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.510
To get his hands
on an antique like that,

12:25.512 --> 12:28.980
The killer would have had to go
to a special-antiques dealer.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.616
Someone say, like...
The frenchman.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.184
Well, yes.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.953
And, well, be -- be sure to
give the frenchman my regards.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.121
No, please, abe.
[ chuckling ] oh, no.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.355
You're bound
to have more luck than I.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.890
You're both
antique dealers.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.759
I know you think
the frenchman is eccentric.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.627
Yeah, well, that --
wrong word, "eccentric."

12:42.629 --> 12:44.896
"creepy"
is more like it.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.097
Please.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.233
Loo-- aren't you gonna
come with me?

12:48.235 --> 12:49.467
No.

12:49.469 --> 12:53.938
I've got my own share of
creepiness to be dealing with.

12:56.575 --> 12:58.109
Abberline:
Come on, then.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.378
You can get a closer look
at her at the morgue.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.381
With your permission,
inspector, I'd like to stay.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.883
There's a great deal
more to be learned

13:04.885 --> 13:06.651
About this killer
by observing the scene.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.019
All due respect,

13:08.021 --> 13:10.455
That's a matter for us
detectives, not doctors.

13:10.457 --> 13:15.326
Well, but...What are doctors
but detectives?

13:15.328 --> 13:19.130
We study a body
and form a diagnosis.

13:19.132 --> 13:23.902
Look, do you see the way
the blood spatter landed?

13:23.904 --> 13:25.170
Well, that means
he split her artery first.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.138
And there's
a post-mortem bruise

13:27.140 --> 13:30.742
In the shape of
the killer's hand on her neck.

13:30.744 --> 13:32.610
The hand
is bigger than average,

13:32.612 --> 13:36.080
Which means the killer is likely
to be of a larger stature.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.917
I mean, this room is littered
with medical clues.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.085
If you give me time
to decipher them,

13:41.087 --> 13:42.387
I'm sure I can paint

13:42.389 --> 13:44.556
A more conclusive portrait
of your killer.

13:45.691 --> 13:49.527
Okay.
See what you can find.

13:55.868 --> 13:58.870
So, mary's roommate gave us
a copy of her client list.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.673
We're going through it now.
Did you find any prints?

14:01.675 --> 14:02.774
None.

14:02.776 --> 14:03.975
I'm afraid
there isn't much

14:03.977 --> 14:05.643
I can tell you
about this killer,

14:05.645 --> 14:08.246
Except that he was too smart
to leave anything behind.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.148
Well, that's the frustrating
thing about psychopaths.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.616
You got to wait for them
to make a mistake.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.652
Unfortunately, jack the ripper
didn't make any mistakes.

14:14.654 --> 14:15.920
Neither did our killer.

14:15.922 --> 14:17.188
I've been
comparing the body

14:17.190 --> 14:18.990
To the original
crime notes on the case.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.392
I'm sorry --
you just happen to have

14:21.394 --> 14:23.561
A copy of
the original crime notes?

14:24.330 --> 14:28.967
Well, before jack the ripper,
medical examiners didn't exist.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.337
It was the birth
of our profession.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.472
Anyone who slices open a body
should study it.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.208
And, by the looks of things,
our killer studied it, too.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.078
Every nick, every cut,
is   <i>exactl</i>where it should be.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.248

femur dislocation,

14:43.250 --> 14:44.983
Even
the wrist laceration --

14:44.985 --> 14:49.420

a defensive mark on her wrist.

Afternoon. Mr. Keely,

<i>Get him out of here!</i>

14:55.195 --> 14:57.762
That cut on her wrist,
did you say it was in
the shape of a star?

14:57.764 --> 15:00.398
It's not him.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.434
The killer
isn't jack the ripper.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.237
Well, yeah,
he has been dead

15:06.239 --> 15:08.239
For probably
a hundred years now.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.507
What did you find?

15:09.509 --> 15:10.608
A mistake.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.444
The original mary kelly
had a cut on her wrist

15:13.446 --> 15:15.179
In the shape
of a semicircle.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.115
But one newspaper,
the    <i>manchester herald,</i>

15:17.117 --> 15:20.318
Wrongly reported it
as a star.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.053
Yeah, so our killer
probably read that article

15:22.055 --> 15:23.721
On the internet.
Possibly.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.723
But the <i>manchester herald</i>

15:25.725 --> 15:28.192
It's unlikely there would be
any online copies.

15:28.194 --> 15:30.862

only one place in the city

That might have

15:32.766 --> 15:33.932
Do we need a warrant?

No,

15:41.607 --> 15:44.442
Always loved

15:44.444 --> 15:47.345

it's practically empty.

Although, I doubt
he ever went by "freddy."

16:14.908 --> 16:17.475
Well, if that's the case,
we've got nothing to go on.
