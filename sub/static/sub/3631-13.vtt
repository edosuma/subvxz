<i>Previously on "Bitten"...</i>

00:01.615 --> 00:03.843
My ad agency wants to acquire
some of the footage you shot.

00:03.867 --> 00:05.067
Wolves running on Cherry Beach.

00:05.068 --> 00:06.467
What do you want, Mr. Boggs?

00:06.469 --> 00:07.668
I want what you got.

00:09.282 --> 00:10.781
No more half-measures.

00:10.783 --> 00:12.849
You really think that's necessary?

00:12.851 --> 00:14.951
I don't understand, what do they want?

00:14.953 --> 00:16.353
They want the Pack destroyed.

00:16.355 --> 00:17.954
And they want you.

00:17.956 --> 00:20.457
Turning humans into an army
of werewolves is bad enough,

00:20.459 --> 00:22.392
but recruiting serial killers...

00:22.394 --> 00:23.694
I want them all dead.

00:23.696 --> 00:25.295
- All except her.
- Don't worry, Daniel.

00:25.297 --> 00:26.697
You'll get your prize.

00:28.734 --> 00:30.167
Please, just leave,

00:30.169 --> 00:31.634
go as far away as you can.

00:31.636 --> 00:33.170
I'm trying to save your life.

00:33.172 --> 00:35.271
Okay, go! While you still can.

00:48.653 --> 00:51.120
When Clay first brought you
to Stonehaven,

00:51.122 --> 00:52.455
I'd just come back from a run

00:52.457 --> 00:53.956
and I was in the middle of a Change

00:53.958 --> 00:55.290
when you turned and saw me.

00:55.292 --> 00:56.592
You thought that I saw you Change,

00:56.594 --> 00:58.327
so you were going to kill me?

00:58.329 --> 01:00.329
And Clay bit me to give me
another chance at living.

01:00.331 --> 01:02.164
All this time,

01:02.166 --> 01:04.333
Clay has been the most trustworthy
person you've ever known.

01:04.334 --> 01:05.735
It's time for action.

01:05.737 --> 01:06.769
What kind of action?

01:06.771 --> 01:08.437
It's time to storm the castle.

01:18.649 --> 01:20.282
I have to get ready.

01:21.917 --> 01:24.353
We'll be ready.

01:24.355 --> 01:26.388
They haven't moved yet.

01:29.825 --> 01:31.492
I failed you.

01:33.963 --> 01:36.164
I couldn't protect Philip.

01:44.506 --> 01:47.675
Philip is alive because you were there.

01:47.677 --> 01:49.910
The fact that he's
involved in any of this

01:49.912 --> 01:52.112
is my fault, not yours.

01:53.715 --> 01:55.849
And you didn't fail me.

01:58.052 --> 02:00.120
You saved me.

02:00.122 --> 02:02.856
I know everything.

02:02.858 --> 02:05.325
Why you bit me.

02:05.327 --> 02:08.561
All the reasons you
couldn't explain why.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.798
You knew I had to trust Jeremy,

02:10.800 --> 02:13.733
or I wouldn't survive
in the world on my own.

02:13.735 --> 02:16.770
You sacrificed our love for my life.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.207
No more sacrifices.

03:06.953 --> 03:08.653
Seems a waste.

03:10.156 --> 03:11.890
All this history,

03:11.892 --> 03:13.691
torched if we go down.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.793
It's for all of our safety, Nick.

03:18.831 --> 03:21.199
If the battle starts to swing their way,

03:21.201 --> 03:22.734
the last one of us
comes back to Stonehaven

03:22.736 --> 03:25.269
and throws a flame down that shaft.

03:27.005 --> 03:28.573
The Mutts might be stupid,

03:28.575 --> 03:30.708
but they know better than to
turn this room over to humans.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.244
I mean, every name is
in here, accounted for.

03:33.246 --> 03:35.413
It's basically a bounty list.

03:37.616 --> 03:40.150
It's not just the humans
I'm worried about.

03:40.152 --> 03:42.753
It's the Mutts too.

03:42.755 --> 03:46.123
There are secrets down here.

03:46.125 --> 03:48.658
Secrets passed from Alpha to Alpha.

03:48.660 --> 03:50.827
If they were to fall
into the wrong hands...

03:52.197 --> 03:53.864
I'll get the kerosene.

03:57.802 --> 04:00.537
You know, just because they have Clay,

04:00.539 --> 04:02.171
it isn't a game ender.

04:02.173 --> 04:06.242
Do you have any idea what
gravel does to Italian leather?

04:10.948 --> 04:12.649
Guess you don't.

04:12.651 --> 04:14.918
Okay, I've been thinking.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.387
You thinking, has proven to
be not such a good thing.

04:18.390 --> 04:22.024
Look at where you are.
How did you get here?

04:22.027 --> 04:24.394
Hmm? Your brand of thinking...

04:24.396 --> 04:26.562
- You did one good thing.
- Yes?

04:26.564 --> 04:29.132
- You tortured the fight out of Clay.
- Not for long.

04:29.134 --> 04:31.700
I should've killed him
when I had the chance.

04:31.702 --> 04:33.836
Your chance is upon you.

04:33.838 --> 04:37.039
Logan is in the wind. Clay is weak.

04:37.041 --> 04:39.074
We have the advantage.

04:39.076 --> 04:40.743
When do we strike?

04:40.745 --> 04:42.845
Everything is almost in place.

04:42.847 --> 04:44.814
It all starts now.

05:28.896 --> 05:31.314
Yeah, this isn't so bad.

05:31.354 --> 05:32.988
Just until our flight, and then...

05:35.925 --> 05:37.926
Yeah. We're good here.

05:37.928 --> 05:40.661
Mr. and Mrs. Smith. And paying in cash?

05:40.663 --> 05:42.263
All right. Tomorrow
when we're in Jamaica,

05:42.265 --> 05:44.332
we'll be Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, okay?

05:44.334 --> 05:45.600
Logan, don't kid like that.

05:45.602 --> 05:48.369
I'm serious.

05:48.371 --> 05:50.304
Me, you and...

05:50.306 --> 05:52.206
Baby Rocco in there.

05:52.208 --> 05:54.542
Rocco?

05:54.544 --> 05:56.409
It's just a suggestion.

05:56.411 --> 05:58.946
Okay. We're safe.

05:58.948 --> 06:00.914
I thank you.

06:00.916 --> 06:04.118
But what's going to happen with Elena?

06:04.120 --> 06:05.719
And the rest of the family?

06:16.865 --> 06:18.031
I... I don't know.

06:20.501 --> 06:22.569
You must be starving.

06:22.571 --> 06:24.737
Do you want to get a pizza? Cheese?

06:24.739 --> 06:26.239
With anchovies?

06:26.241 --> 06:28.642
Anchovies...

06:28.644 --> 06:31.443
That's new, but... okay.

06:31.445 --> 06:33.012
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- No-no-no,

06:33.014 --> 06:36.515
I want you to rest up here.

06:36.517 --> 06:38.651
Because from here on out,

06:38.653 --> 06:41.821
I'm going to be waiting
on you hand and foot.

06:41.823 --> 06:44.190
You're going to have to get used to it.

06:44.192 --> 06:46.925
- I like that.
- Yeah?

06:46.927 --> 06:48.227
Okay.

07:05.477 --> 07:06.878
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.446
Anything on the GPS?

07:08.448 --> 07:11.183
My phone's planted in Santos'
car and it hasn't moved.

07:11.185 --> 07:13.752
This could all be a bust if
they're using another vehicle.

07:13.754 --> 07:16.354
Mm-hmm. How's Clay?

07:18.490 --> 07:20.625
They did a number on him, Nick.

07:22.261 --> 07:23.894
He's not the only one.

07:25.997 --> 07:27.732
Who, me?

07:27.734 --> 07:30.468
- I'm fine.
- You're angry.

07:30.470 --> 07:32.937
I can see it.

07:32.939 --> 07:35.606
You have every right to be,
they killed your father.

07:35.608 --> 07:37.574
I'm going to make them pay

07:37.576 --> 07:39.710
for what they did to everyone in my life.

07:49.187 --> 07:50.721
Clay's resting.

07:50.723 --> 07:53.957
But he needs days, not hours.

07:53.959 --> 07:56.092
Say what you really need to say, Elena.

08:01.566 --> 08:03.600
Neither of us can change the past.

08:03.602 --> 08:06.202
He did what he did to protect us both.

08:06.204 --> 08:07.704
From each other.

08:07.706 --> 08:09.739
The only one he didn't
protect was himself.

08:09.741 --> 08:12.408
And I will never let that happen again.

08:12.410 --> 08:15.544
I will stand in the way of
anything that comes at him.

08:17.047 --> 08:18.314
Even you.

08:30.628 --> 08:33.596
"Kind woman lives here."

08:33.597 --> 08:35.164
"Tell a sad story."

08:37.066 --> 08:39.735
Sounds like your kind of town.

08:39.736 --> 08:42.004
The ramblings of a mad man.

08:42.006 --> 08:44.173
Have you gone bonkers on us, Mr. Marsten?

08:44.174 --> 08:46.675
You've never really lived
the life, have you?

08:46.677 --> 08:48.510
Language of the transient.

08:48.512 --> 08:51.513
Where to find a meal.
Where to rest your head.

08:51.515 --> 08:53.949
There were nights when
I first came here...

08:53.951 --> 08:55.450
I had nothing...

08:55.452 --> 08:57.885
and I used to Change
just to go to sleep.

08:57.887 --> 09:00.855
Seemed less shame sleeping
in a field as a wolf.

09:00.857 --> 09:02.791
But then I started
learning things like this:

09:02.793 --> 09:04.258
hobo code.

09:04.260 --> 09:08.029
And I learned how to influence
people to part with their money.

09:08.031 --> 09:10.565
I decided never to sleep
in a field again.

09:14.602 --> 09:17.004
Is that what this is about for you?

09:17.006 --> 09:19.073
A bed?

09:21.910 --> 09:23.811
Chop chop. We're on the move.

09:25.413 --> 09:26.948
What, now?

09:26.950 --> 09:29.616
The three of us?

09:29.618 --> 09:32.219
It's a suicide mission!

09:32.221 --> 09:34.722
Numbers.

09:34.724 --> 09:36.256
You think I'm an idiot?

09:36.258 --> 09:37.924
I put together an army.

09:39.227 --> 09:42.329
Do you know what gravel
does to Italian leather?

09:42.331 --> 09:44.331
No, obviously not.

09:44.333 --> 09:47.300
Well, yours are about as
Italian as Chef Boyardee.

09:47.302 --> 09:49.970
Ha ha! Well, we'll see how they look

09:49.972 --> 09:53.273
when I'm using Jeremy's
head as a footstool.

10:01.950 --> 10:03.983
Just got word from my guys.

10:03.985 --> 10:05.951
Everything's clean in Toronto.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.520
<i>Good. What about Philip?</i>

10:07.522 --> 10:08.721
Tracked him to the airport.

10:08.723 --> 10:10.256
<i>He's on a flight to France.</i>

10:10.258 --> 10:12.324
What were you able to find out
about James Williams?

10:12.326 --> 10:13.626
<i>Not much.</i>

10:13.628 --> 10:15.361
Fake website run by some
guy named Nate Parker.

10:15.363 --> 10:17.530
<i>- Did you track him down?</i>
- He's gone missing.

10:17.532 --> 10:19.665
Last address, Toronto.
Before that, Churchill.

10:19.667 --> 10:21.066
<i>Churchill?</i>

10:21.068 --> 10:22.968
That's where Malcolm was killed.

10:22.970 --> 10:25.104
<i>You know your father</i>
<i>didn't go down lightly.</i>

10:25.106 --> 10:26.571
And what you're up against here,

10:26.573 --> 10:28.340
you need a show of force, Jeremy.

10:28.342 --> 10:30.575
I think Joey and I should be
on the next flight out there.

10:30.577 --> 10:31.843
<i>No.</i>

10:31.845 --> 10:33.812
No, they want to kill us and take Elena.

10:33.814 --> 10:35.647
And I need to know that
if things go sideways here,

10:35.649 --> 10:38.316
there's another wave of Pack members
that will fight to get her back.

10:38.318 --> 10:41.085
Look, if you're worried about
Elena, send her to me in Vancouver.

10:41.087 --> 10:42.287
<i>Jorge,</i>

10:42.289 --> 10:45.323
I've tried all manner of protecting her.

10:45.325 --> 10:49.193
But when she is separated
from us, things fall apart.

10:49.195 --> 10:52.764
Clay falls apart. And he's weak
enough as it is right now.

10:54.199 --> 10:57.201
The Pack is at its strongest
when she's with us.

10:57.203 --> 10:59.537
Right now it's the only
chance we've got.

11:02.341 --> 11:05.276
You owe me a bottle
of bourbon, you know?

11:05.278 --> 11:07.912
Me?

11:07.914 --> 11:10.147
After I first met you,

11:10.149 --> 11:13.617
you came for the job posting
as my research assistant;

11:13.619 --> 11:15.886
Pete bet me a bottle of bourbon.

11:18.490 --> 11:20.123
What was the bet?

11:20.125 --> 11:22.292
That I'd fall in love with you.

11:25.964 --> 11:27.297
You lost.

11:29.167 --> 11:31.501
We both won.

11:43.413 --> 11:45.314
Santos' car is on the move.

11:53.056 --> 11:55.758
As long as the battery on my phone
is good, we can track them.

11:55.760 --> 11:56.960
What's their course?

11:56.962 --> 11:58.595
Just outside of Bear Valley.

11:58.597 --> 11:59.996
About 30 minutes away.

12:04.934 --> 12:06.202
We'll wait for them here.

12:06.204 --> 12:08.004
We'll fight them at Stonehaven.

12:08.006 --> 12:09.671
How do you know they're coming here?

12:09.673 --> 12:11.440
It's what I would do.

12:11.442 --> 12:13.976
Jeremy, we have the advantage
of surprise if we leave now.

12:13.978 --> 12:15.611
Our advantage is here.

12:15.613 --> 12:17.312
We barricade the doors.

12:17.314 --> 12:18.881
We can't keep them out but
we can slow then down

12:18.883 --> 12:20.716
and eliminate them one by one.

12:20.718 --> 12:21.984
That's exactly what they want, though.

12:21.986 --> 12:23.552
This house and everything in it.

12:23.554 --> 12:25.514
They'll have to kill us
before they take anything.

12:30.960 --> 12:34.229
We will win here.

12:34.231 --> 12:36.797
Or we will die here.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.534
But we are strongest here.

12:39.536 --> 12:41.169
Together.

13:31.116 --> 13:32.383
20 minutes out!

14:07.818 --> 14:10.019
I want to show you something.

14:11.121 --> 14:13.155
If you have to torch the Legacy...

14:17.094 --> 14:19.995
You'll leave this way.
It leads to the greenhouse.

14:22.666 --> 14:25.634
How did I not know about this?

14:25.636 --> 14:29.371
We survive because of our secrets, Nick.
All of us.

14:30.807 --> 14:33.675
I met your mother once.

14:33.677 --> 14:37.212
Antonio didn't want anybody
to know that he was in love.

14:37.214 --> 14:38.981
He pretended that it was just a fling.

14:38.983 --> 14:41.716
But when you saw the two
of them together...

14:41.718 --> 14:46.220
So... very beautiful...

14:46.222 --> 14:47.689
Talked a lot...

14:47.691 --> 14:50.091
And this incredible laugh.

14:50.093 --> 14:51.860
Your dad didn't say two
words that whole afternoon

14:51.862 --> 14:53.962
and he just sat there,

14:53.964 --> 14:56.030
staring at her.

14:56.032 --> 14:59.033
He couldn't take his eyes
off her for even a second.

14:59.035 --> 15:00.401
We weren't fooled.

15:00.403 --> 15:02.236
Some things you just can't hide.

15:04.873 --> 15:06.807
I asked Jorge to find her.

15:06.809 --> 15:08.676
I know.

15:08.678 --> 15:11.479
You don't have to do that.

15:11.481 --> 15:13.380
I know where your mother is.

15:43.778 --> 15:45.112
Damn it.

15:45.114 --> 15:47.514
You're not ready.

15:52.386 --> 15:53.786
Hey.

15:53.788 --> 15:55.254
Logan.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.325
Hey.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.862
Just in time to help.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.706
How are your injuries?

16:14.708 --> 16:16.008
I'm fine.

16:16.010 --> 16:17.943
You gave us quite a scare.

16:17.945 --> 16:20.478
What, that I left, or the fact that
I came back in the first place?

16:20.480 --> 16:23.582
Bringing Rachel here complicated
matters for all of us.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.284
They're still moving.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.688
They're through Bear Valley.

16:29.690 --> 16:31.690
Right or wrong, this
doesn't complicate things,

16:31.692 --> 16:34.660
it clarifies things. I can't
adhere to the rules, Jeremy.

16:34.662 --> 16:37.195
I'm not going to steal my
son for you to raise him.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.431
They're moving towards Stonehaven.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.933
You were halfway to some place else.

16:41.935 --> 16:44.369
Why did you come back, then?

16:44.371 --> 16:47.372
Nothing to do with
Pack Law or Pack rules.

16:47.374 --> 16:50.641
When this is done, I'm still
going off the grid with her.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.477
I didn't come back because
you're my Pack Alpha.

16:53.479 --> 16:55.512
I came back because you're my family.

16:56.915 --> 16:59.316
And no one else is going to die.

16:59.318 --> 17:00.451
Not today.

17:02.487 --> 17:03.988
Where are they now?

17:05.857 --> 17:07.657
They're right outside.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.367
Let's go greet them.

17:47.731 --> 17:49.665
There's nothing out here.

17:49.667 --> 17:51.167
It says he's here.

18:03.047 --> 18:04.579
Logan, don't!

18:08.653 --> 18:10.052
Mutt!

18:26.469 --> 18:29.804
How many are there?

18:29.806 --> 18:32.874
We'll brace
ourselves for the worst.

18:32.876 --> 18:34.608
Hide her.

18:38.747 --> 18:40.982
Ready?

18:51.129 --> 18:52.690
We're going to have to fight as humans.

18:52.708 --> 18:54.134
We don't have time to Change.

18:54.161 --> 18:56.995
We stay in pairs. Nobody fights alone.

18:57.528 --> 18:59.428
Stay in each other's eye-lines.

19:01.122 --> 19:03.390
It's okay, baby, it's okay.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.993
It's okay, you're all right.

19:05.995 --> 19:07.294
They blindfolded me

19:07.296 --> 19:09.196
and then they put me
in the trunk of a car.

19:09.198 --> 19:11.431
I... I couldn't see. Logan,
They're going to kill us.

19:11.433 --> 19:13.367
I was in the trunk. I heard it all.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.469
They're not going to stop
until we're all dead!

19:27.782 --> 19:29.616
Why did you come here?

19:29.618 --> 19:31.518
You knew this wasn't
over and you left me!

19:31.520 --> 19:34.220
I couldn't leave them! Not yet.

19:43.297 --> 19:44.430
Get in.

19:45.933 --> 19:47.533
Then what?

19:47.535 --> 19:50.603
You choke another bad guy
until he passes out?

19:50.605 --> 19:52.304
No.

19:52.306 --> 19:54.472
I'm going to choke him till he's dead.

19:58.744 --> 20:00.212
Get in.

20:11.290 --> 20:12.424
You okay?

20:15.394 --> 20:16.528
Okay.

20:23.603 --> 20:26.103
Why don't we just burn it down?

20:26.105 --> 20:28.205
'Cause that's my house.

20:29.474 --> 20:31.309
It's our house.

20:31.311 --> 20:33.811
Feel free to go kill at will.

20:33.813 --> 20:36.013
The others should be inside already.

20:38.116 --> 20:40.484
Aren't you going to throw
yourself into the mix?

20:40.486 --> 20:42.453
That's why we have meat.

20:42.455 --> 20:45.188
A true king leads the first wave.

20:45.190 --> 20:46.857
I don't see you up there.

20:46.859 --> 20:48.191
I'm not the heir apparent,

20:48.193 --> 20:49.993
- nor am I meat.
- No,

20:49.995 --> 20:51.929
you're just the pain in my ass.

20:51.931 --> 20:53.296
Go with him.

20:53.298 --> 20:55.398
Make sure he keeps his hands off Elena.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.867
Don't worry.

20:56.869 --> 20:59.269
You're going to get everything
that's coming to you.

21:19.389 --> 21:21.423
Nick, come! They're in the kitchen.

21:44.914 --> 21:46.382
Ahh!

22:07.469 --> 22:09.370
Payback time, Danvers.

24:21.366 --> 24:23.367
You're wasting your time with Elena.

24:23.369 --> 24:25.101
You know you're not allowed to kill her.

24:25.103 --> 24:26.903
You want to kill, we find Jeremy.

24:26.905 --> 24:29.173
Leave the girl alone.

24:29.175 --> 24:31.241
Who says I'm going to kill her?

24:31.243 --> 24:33.843
You do. Time and time again.

24:33.845 --> 24:35.244
Hmmm...

24:35.246 --> 24:37.180
You're right. I do, don't I?

26:18.646 --> 26:20.647
Nick, I'm so scared.

26:20.649 --> 26:22.048
My heart's going to explode.

26:22.050 --> 26:23.250
I have to get out of here!

26:23.252 --> 26:24.651
I know... it's okay.

26:24.653 --> 26:25.952
I'll come back for you when I can.

26:25.954 --> 26:27.988
Just promise me you'll stay here.

26:27.990 --> 26:30.190
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

26:45.872 --> 26:48.407
Everyone's inside.

26:48.409 --> 26:50.542
Why aren't you?

26:50.544 --> 26:53.813
I... I was waiting for you,
for further orders.

26:53.815 --> 26:57.249
The orders were "storm it, take it."

26:57.251 --> 26:58.684
Well, that's what's happening.

26:58.686 --> 27:01.020
I just decided to general this from afar.

27:01.022 --> 27:03.522
And you think that's
going to win her heart?

27:03.524 --> 27:06.391
Go in, boy! Show her
you're the real Alpha.

27:06.393 --> 27:07.892
And how about you?

27:07.894 --> 27:09.894
You're just going to waltz
through the front door?

27:09.896 --> 27:12.631
What would be the fun in that?

27:12.633 --> 27:15.400
Come on. Let's show you
one of the secrets

27:15.402 --> 27:17.536
of the house that's about to be yours.

27:49.765 --> 27:50.965
Logan!

28:07.951 --> 28:09.417
Well, well, well.

28:09.419 --> 28:11.686
I'm thinking of starting
a new scrapbook,

28:11.688 --> 28:14.522
and you are going to be my first entry.

28:14.524 --> 28:16.691
Put the knife down and we'll fight fair.

28:16.693 --> 28:18.693
Oh, don't even try to play to my morals.

28:18.695 --> 28:20.828
Simple fact is, I don't have any.

28:22.565 --> 28:25.999
Thomas, you know the conditions
of our respective deals.

28:26.001 --> 28:27.567
You're not to touch Elena.

28:27.569 --> 28:29.970
I'm getting sick of being told,

28:29.972 --> 28:32.706
"I'm not to touch Elena".

28:32.708 --> 28:35.909
'Cause all I want to do is touch you.

28:35.911 --> 28:38.511
From the inside out.

28:38.513 --> 28:42.315
But you're some kind
of prize, so I can't.

28:44.017 --> 28:45.518
Thing is,

28:45.520 --> 28:48.087
I'm not one for prizes.

28:56.731 --> 29:00.233
It's not because she's a prize,

29:00.235 --> 29:01.667
it's because she's a lady!

29:15.348 --> 29:18.150
You have no reason to trust me,

29:18.152 --> 29:20.786
except for my word.

29:20.788 --> 29:22.354
What's your word?

29:24.991 --> 29:26.625
Mutiny.

30:03.229 --> 30:04.462
No! No.

30:04.464 --> 30:06.063
He saved my life.

30:06.065 --> 30:07.764
It's a trick.

30:07.766 --> 30:10.567
A Trojan horse. We kill him now,

30:10.569 --> 30:12.102
we don't have to find out if he's lying.

30:12.104 --> 30:15.206
No.

30:15.208 --> 30:17.507
He just helped me kill Leblanc.

30:17.509 --> 30:20.544
Forget Boggs. We need
to deal with Santos.

30:23.781 --> 30:25.315
And him?

30:28.353 --> 30:30.687
We let Jeremy decide.

30:37.762 --> 30:39.062
No sign of Santos.

30:39.064 --> 30:40.897
That coward's probably
pissing in the woods,

30:40.899 --> 30:43.099
waiting for his minions
to do all his dirty work.

30:43.101 --> 30:44.734
We find him,

30:44.736 --> 30:45.869
we kill him.

31:15.965 --> 31:17.565
She's gone!

31:17.567 --> 31:19.201
Rachel, I've got to find
her, she can't run.

31:19.203 --> 31:21.870
- Hey, hey! Everything she's been through.
- The baby!

31:23.539 --> 31:25.040
He shouldn't go alone.

31:25.042 --> 31:27.842
I'll go. We won't be long.

31:45.460 --> 31:47.628
What other secrets are there?

31:47.630 --> 31:49.563
Everything around you.

31:50.899 --> 31:53.567
Was he the serial killer or the rapist?

31:53.569 --> 31:56.304
A little bit of both.

31:56.306 --> 31:57.638
So what now?

32:00.008 --> 32:01.708
We go upstairs.

32:24.298 --> 32:25.665
It's Marsten.

32:34.508 --> 32:36.442
You're alive.

32:36.444 --> 32:39.411
Huh. You sound surprised.

32:39.413 --> 32:41.180
I'm relieved.

32:41.182 --> 32:43.916
If you're alive, the Pack must be dead.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.017
Are you mad?

32:45.019 --> 32:47.520
It's all gone to hell in a handbasket.

32:47.522 --> 32:49.555
Then why are you just standing here?

32:49.557 --> 32:50.755
Like you said:

32:50.757 --> 32:53.592
you run, they'll find us.

32:53.594 --> 32:55.827
Better to face the music.

32:55.829 --> 32:57.796
Even if it is a swan song.

33:08.642 --> 33:10.074
Oh, turncoat.

33:10.076 --> 33:12.276
That's how it's going to play, huh?

33:12.278 --> 33:14.012
Enough.

33:14.014 --> 33:15.146
Mr. Marsten.

33:16.649 --> 33:18.783
I hear you've had a change of heart.

33:20.887 --> 33:22.787
That is correct.

33:22.789 --> 33:24.489
But I understand I bring with me

33:24.491 --> 33:26.324
a recent history of wrongdoing.

33:26.326 --> 33:27.892
Wrongdoing?

33:27.894 --> 33:30.294
Three innocent people from Bear Valley.

33:30.296 --> 33:33.197
One was 10 years old.

33:33.199 --> 33:34.698
He bit in Scott Brandon.

33:34.700 --> 33:37.568
He is responsible for those deaths.

33:40.839 --> 33:43.273
How do I know that this
awakening of good conscience

33:43.275 --> 33:44.975
is not just a momentary lapse?

33:44.977 --> 33:46.109
You don't!

33:48.379 --> 33:49.713
You don't.

33:51.616 --> 33:52.850
Jeremy...

33:52.852 --> 33:55.853
I never chose sides prior to this.

33:55.855 --> 33:57.820
I lived a solitary life.

33:57.822 --> 33:59.622
Never pledging allegiance to anything

33:59.624 --> 34:01.624
but my own love of the long con.

34:01.626 --> 34:04.127
And this is just another long con.

34:04.129 --> 34:05.462
No.

34:07.498 --> 34:09.799
All I ask

34:09.801 --> 34:11.734
is for a swift death.

34:18.007 --> 34:20.476
I think that you would be
of more use to the Pack

34:20.478 --> 34:21.978
if you were alive.

34:25.983 --> 34:27.216
Huh...

34:29.585 --> 34:31.820
Well, if you think that's best, then...

34:33.290 --> 34:35.458
I am at your beck and call.

34:36.560 --> 34:39.261
You think <i>he</i> is of use to you?

34:39.263 --> 34:42.264
Look at what I'm capable of!

34:42.266 --> 34:45.867
I created an empire of mayhem.

34:45.869 --> 34:50.072
Sure, they're all dead now, but...

34:50.074 --> 34:53.341
Oh, it was glorious while it lasted.

34:53.342 --> 34:54.542
And you.

34:54.543 --> 34:56.612
You...

34:56.614 --> 34:58.747
never even saw it coming!

35:04.987 --> 35:08.189
I see very clearly
how it's going to end.

35:11.960 --> 35:15.430
Fine! Do it!

35:15.432 --> 35:16.797
Do it!

35:18.467 --> 35:20.200
I'm not going to kill you.

35:25.340 --> 35:26.540
I am.

35:26.542 --> 35:28.242
Ah, yes.

35:28.244 --> 35:29.610
That's it.

35:31.412 --> 35:35.016
All I ever wanted was
to put my hands on you.

35:35.018 --> 35:38.152
And in the end, it's your hands on me.

35:38.154 --> 35:42.489
You wanted more than your hands on me.

35:42.491 --> 35:45.025
You wanted me,

35:45.027 --> 35:49.729
my life, my future, my children.

35:49.731 --> 35:52.431
You just don't understand.

35:52.433 --> 35:55.601
They were going to be perfect.

35:55.603 --> 35:58.171
Pure...

35:58.173 --> 36:01.741
And you were going to be the most
important member of our kind.

36:03.044 --> 36:05.045
She already is.

36:05.047 --> 36:08.514
My future never belonged to you.

36:08.516 --> 36:11.950
It was never yours for the taking.

36:14.388 --> 36:16.189
Well, you always had my heart.

36:19.092 --> 36:21.827
And now, I'm going to break it.

37:34.180 --> 37:35.712
Rachel!

37:36.982 --> 37:38.415
Rachel!

37:38.417 --> 37:40.117
Rachel!

37:49.027 --> 37:52.028
- Logan.
- What, you smell something?

37:52.030 --> 37:54.030
I don't smell anything,
that's the problem.

37:54.032 --> 37:55.665
Look, I've got to go back.
There may be anymore Mutts.

37:55.667 --> 37:57.734
No, I can't. Not until I find her.

37:59.771 --> 38:02.372
When you find her, that's it?

38:02.374 --> 38:04.007
You're going off the grid?

38:07.544 --> 38:10.980
Come here.

38:10.982 --> 38:12.781
I'm going to miss you, bro.

38:15.886 --> 38:18.287
Go. You find her.

38:19.556 --> 38:21.056
I will.

38:55.424 --> 38:58.325
I had hoped that the rumours
of your death were true.

38:58.327 --> 39:00.862
Hope is for high school
girls with crushes

39:00.864 --> 39:02.463
and hospital cancer wards.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.666
What are you doing in this house?

39:04.668 --> 39:06.935
Nostalgia tour.

39:06.937 --> 39:10.137
You turned my bedroom
into your craft space.

39:10.139 --> 39:13.574
Still painting thunderstorms.
How dramatic.

39:13.576 --> 39:16.143
You always were such a serious child.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.845
You wanted me dead
from the day I was born.

39:18.847 --> 39:21.282
I never wanted a son.

39:21.284 --> 39:23.350
Especially one like you.

39:23.352 --> 39:26.019
If you didn't hide behind
your grandfather's coattails,

39:26.021 --> 39:29.056
I would've killed you years ago.

39:29.058 --> 39:32.325
Now, I'm just enjoying the ride.

39:32.327 --> 39:34.795
And this one...

39:34.797 --> 39:36.997
Such promise.

39:36.999 --> 39:39.066
At least he listened.

39:39.068 --> 39:41.501
You're responsible for all of this?

39:41.503 --> 39:43.570
The inception, yes.

39:43.572 --> 39:45.238
And the victories.

39:45.240 --> 39:47.407
What victories?

39:47.409 --> 39:49.309
All I see is your failure.

39:49.311 --> 39:50.577
Failure?

39:50.579 --> 39:51.877
I've only just begun, boy.

39:51.879 --> 39:54.514
You want to challenge me for Alpha?

39:54.516 --> 39:56.116
You will lose again.

39:56.118 --> 39:58.518
I don't care about Alpha.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.020
I don't want Stonehaven.
It's just another trinket.

40:01.022 --> 40:03.990
What is it that you really want...

40:03.992 --> 40:05.524
father?

40:05.526 --> 40:08.995
A future.

40:08.997 --> 40:10.129
Her.

40:14.334 --> 40:15.534
You want Elena.

40:15.536 --> 40:17.869
You're a fool, Jeremy.

40:17.871 --> 40:19.404
You had her for years,

40:19.406 --> 40:21.973
never used her to her full potential.

40:21.975 --> 40:25.076
Your weakness is that
you care about her.

40:27.580 --> 40:30.282
If you want Elena,

40:30.284 --> 40:32.351
you will have to come through me.

40:32.353 --> 40:34.986
Which is exactly what I intend to do.

40:38.624 --> 40:41.126
My best is yet to come.

40:51.271 --> 40:53.471
I didn't even have to go in.

40:53.473 --> 40:57.007
Silly little thing was
running through the woods.

40:57.009 --> 40:58.842
Malcolm Danvers.

40:58.844 --> 41:01.579
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

41:01.581 --> 41:04.348
I hope you liked the rattle.

41:04.350 --> 41:06.684
I hand-picked it myself.

41:18.396 --> 41:19.930
Jakob Fenn.

41:19.932 --> 41:21.531
His father's still alive.

41:21.533 --> 41:24.000
Maybe he'd want these, and to
know that his son is dead.

41:24.002 --> 41:25.402
Or we could just bury them.

41:25.404 --> 41:27.637
No.

41:27.639 --> 41:29.439
His father's a good man.

41:32.910 --> 41:35.512
This all happened because
we stopped tracking.

41:35.514 --> 41:38.114
I took myself off the grid,
we stopped paying attention,

41:38.116 --> 41:39.949
and they took advantage of us.

41:39.951 --> 41:42.185
You can't blame yourself.

41:43.587 --> 41:46.756
It's not going to happen a second time.

41:46.758 --> 41:50.059
You and me, we're going
to start tracking again.

41:50.061 --> 41:52.195
Keeping tabs on them.

41:53.964 --> 41:56.798
You and me.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.200
Yeah.

42:09.213 --> 42:12.513
Just one more thing I need to fix.

42:12.515 --> 42:14.315
I'll be right back.

43:19.147 --> 43:21.448
No-o-o-o!
