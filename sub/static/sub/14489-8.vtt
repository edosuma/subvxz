00:41.042 --> 00:42.293
Tell me about it.

For once, I thought
it might be nice

a social setting,

00:46.631 --> 00:48.591

call me Orange Joe.

It's July, right?

is going on here?

Fry, quiet. Oktoberfest
is a classy celebration

01:53.948 --> 01:55.617

humans have evolved.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.702
You need to be on
your best behavior.

01:57.785 --> 02:01.289
No chance! You can all act
like Jersey Shore socialites,

Right, buddy?

Can I get in on this?

02:34.739 --> 02:37.492
Sure, I don't care.
You bring your ingredients?

02:37.575 --> 02:39.243

by encroaching ice age.

12:50.854 --> 12:54.900
Now we sealed in
under sky of ice.

12:55.276 --> 12:58.612
So my sadness
makes perfect sense.

12:58.696 --> 13:02.157
And I do have vague memories of
people refusing to breed with me!

13:06.036 --> 13:07.037
(CAWING)

13:08.747 --> 13:10.916
A raven's brought
word for you, sir.

13:11.750 --> 13:15.129
Guys, guys! My sausage made
the finals at Oktoberfest!

13:15.212 --> 13:17.339
We gotta go back for
the closing ceremony!

13:17.506 --> 13:18.924
Oktoberfest?

13:22.177 --> 13:23.178
(CLUCKS)

13:29.435 --> 13:30.811
Sounds like fun!

13:33.147 --> 13:38.193
Chief! Me find huge hole melted in
ice, out past Cesar Chavez ridge!

13:38.277 --> 13:40.654
Hole go all
the way outside!

13:40.738 --> 13:42.614
This very interesting.

13:42.698 --> 13:45.492
Maybe someone look into it,
many years from now.

13:45.576 --> 13:47.703
But, Chief, this means
we're not trapped anymore!

13:47.786 --> 13:49.997
It's our chance to take
back the outside world

13:50.080 --> 13:52.249
from those
stuck-up Homo sapiens

13:52.416 --> 13:54.585
with their tools and
their pants and such.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.755
My fellow big-brows!
Are you with me?

13:58.047 --> 13:59.715
(CHEERING)

14:05.429 --> 14:06.430
(SIGHS)

14:06.555 --> 14:08.515
You've been staring
at that pumpkin

14:08.640 --> 14:10.642
for like, five seconds.
What's up?

14:10.934 --> 14:13.812
It's... It's
something about the color.

14:13.979 --> 14:14.980
(SNIFFING)

14:15.272 --> 14:16.648
<i>Oh, boo-hoe.</i>

14:16.732 --> 14:19.651
Why are you crying now,
you depressed lunatic?

14:19.818 --> 14:22.404
I don't know.
I should be happy.

14:22.613 --> 14:24.907
Bender's sausage
just won third place.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.075
Third place?

14:26.158 --> 14:30.287
This is the greatest injustice
Germany has ever committed!

14:30.496 --> 14:33.207
Aha, Leela,
we meet again.

14:33.290 --> 14:36.168
But this time, I'm the one
criticizing the sausage.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.128

14:53.185 --> 14:56.105
Dear God, look at
those hairy elephants!

14:56.397 --> 14:58.399
Kill all modern humans!

14:58.482 --> 15:00.025
Hey, this guy's all right.

15:00.109 --> 15:01.110
(SCREAMS)

15:40.524 --> 15:42.526
Oh, yeah.
Second place!

15:45.529 --> 15:47.573
Release the giant sloth!

(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

16:06.091 --> 16:08.135
Do something!
Fear not, Leela.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.721
They may not have
technology, like us,

16:10.846 --> 16:13.307
but we have something
they don't have.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.766
Technology.

16:17.019 --> 16:21.732
Behold our latest weapon, a
revolutionary fleet of unmanned drones.

16:21.815 --> 16:22.900
With men in them.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.651
Then how are
they unmanned?

16:24.735 --> 16:26.195
The men are just for ballast.

16:26.278 --> 16:29.448
I control all the drones
from this single unit.

16:29.740 --> 16:31.158
Foolproof and durable,

16:31.241 --> 16:34.995
it's designed to withstand even the
weight of a modern-day elephant foot.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.747
(TRUMPETING)
(SCREAMING)

16:42.211 --> 16:43.629
(SCREAMING HOARSELY)

16:52.262 --> 16:54.681
Chef Fritz,
thank God you're all right!

16:54.765 --> 16:56.266
Come with me,
I'll protect you!

16:58.268 --> 17:00.270
(LAUGHING EVILLY)

17:22.626 --> 17:25.045
Neanderthals, load catapult!

17:25.753 --> 17:29.466
Up here in the clouds, our
technology makes us invincible,

17:29.550 --> 17:31.802
like the mighty
"X" in tic-tac-toe.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.054
Look at those pathetic
cavemen down there,

17:34.179 --> 17:36.390
loading their
silly catapult with...

17:36.974 --> 17:37.933
What is that, Kif?

17:38.016 --> 17:39.017
(GROWLING)

17:39.142 --> 17:40.477

17:41.728 --> 17:44.356
I believe it's a
saber-tooth cat, sir.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.369
I guess it's just me
and you, chicken hat.

18:05.335 --> 18:07.504
Die, you primitive brute!

18:17.306 --> 18:18.724
(SHOUTING WAR CRY)

18:23.186 --> 18:25.188
(GRUNTING AND STRAINING)

18:26.690 --> 18:28.275
What do you Neanderthals want?

18:28.358 --> 18:30.110
We want our land back!

18:30.193 --> 18:33.697
Also, to be treated as equals! And
a little mating wouldn't hurt!

18:46.668 --> 18:47.878
Orange?

18:48.211 --> 18:49.630
Purple?

18:50.047 --> 18:51.840
Do I know you?
Have we met?

19:05.062 --> 19:08.357
What Orange-Hair doing
with Homo sapien?

19:08.565 --> 19:10.901
Uh, look like
interbreeding.

19:11.234 --> 19:12.903
OW! Ahh!

19:13.070 --> 19:15.364
You want make love,
not war?

19:15.447 --> 19:16.490
<i>Jawohl.</i>

19:18.241 --> 19:21.411
This change everything,
Tight-Clothes-Man.

19:21.578 --> 19:26.333
We forgive Homo sapiens for
actions of stuck-up ancestors.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.376
So be it.

19:27.459 --> 19:30.128
In recognition of your
overwhelming victory,

19:30.212 --> 19:31.880
let's call it a draw.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.590
(CHEERING)

19:48.939 --> 19:49.940

(BLOOD DRAINING)

19:51.817 --> 19:52.859
Leela?

19:52.943 --> 19:55.487
I didn't recognize you
with your head all swollen.

19:55.570 --> 19:56.863
But it looks better now.

19:56.947 --> 19:59.449
I guess the blood must have
rushed somewhere else.

19:59.908 --> 20:03.870
Guys, guys! Chef Fritz accidentally
got thrown down an icy slope!

20:03.954 --> 20:06.581
I'm the sausage champion!
(WHOOPING)

20:06.832 --> 20:08.375
No further questions!

20:11.086 --> 20:13.296
ZAPP: Rounds for everybody!

20:33.275 --> 20:36.862
Now this is Oktoberfest!
Just like the olden days.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.906
I have to admit,
your version is more fun.

20:39.990 --> 20:41.366
(CHICKEN DANCE PLAYING)

20:41.450 --> 20:43.702
They're playing
our stupid song!

20:44.953 --> 20:46.163
Care to join me?

20:46.413 --> 20:50.584
No, Leela. Just this once, I'm
going to let you embarrass me.
