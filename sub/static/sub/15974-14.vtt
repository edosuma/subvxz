<i>Casey: Leonard Mooker of
Newton, Massachusetts, asks,</i>

01:49:47.852 --> 01:49:50.321
<i>"If the 1927
New York Yankees team played</i>

01:49:50.388 --> 01:49:54.086
"the 1998 New York Yankees team
in the World Series, who'd win?"

01:49:54.159 --> 01:49:55.752
Leonard, get a grip.

01:49:55.827 --> 01:49:57.591
The World Series, by tradition,

01:49:57.662 --> 01:49:59.721
is contested
by two different teams

01:49:59.798 --> 01:50:02.563
made up of players
that are alive at the same time.

01:50:02.634 --> 01:50:04.693
But if you want an answer
to your question,

01:50:04.769 --> 01:50:07.363
my guess is that the '27 Yankees
would be confounded

01:50:07.439 --> 01:50:09.305
by the jet airplanes
flying overhead.

01:50:09.374 --> 01:50:11.308
And that does it
for "Ask Dan and Casey."

01:50:11.376 --> 01:50:12.502
Dan.

01:50:12.577 --> 01:50:14.739
We've got more coming up,

and a swim in the shark tank,

01:50:16.214 --> 01:50:18.808
plus you never know when Casey's
gonna freak out on the air.

01:50:18.883 --> 01:50:22.114

-- Yes.

01:50:29.394 --> 01:50:30.327
-- I can't?
-- No.

01:50:30.395 --> 01:50:32.557
-- Why not? -- 'Cause I'm tired

-- The end of the Michigan game?
-- Yeah. -- Not yet.

01:50:46.277 --> 01:50:49.338
Jeremy, we don't have film
on the end of the Michigan game?

01:50:49.414 --> 01:50:50.245
-- No.
-- Why not?

01:50:50.315 --> 01:50:52.613

It was 66 degrees

Tell me quickly why I care.

01:51:00.425 --> 01:51:01.517
No earthly reason.

01:51:01.593 --> 01:51:03.254
-- So you really don't understand?
-- No.

01:51:03.328 --> 01:51:05.729
Then I'm gonna have to spread it
out for you in a nutshell.

01:51:05.797 --> 01:51:06.855
[sighs] Okay.

01:51:06.931 --> 01:51:08.399
I was riding the elevator
a couple of weeks ago.

01:51:08.466 --> 01:51:09.558

01:51:09.634 --> 01:51:10.999
No, Casey.

-- Listen -- -- You don't

01:51:13.104 --> 01:51:14.367
I'm gonna tell the story
clearly.

01:51:14.439 --> 01:51:16.407
The things you need to know,
I'm gonna tell you.

01:51:16.474 --> 01:51:19.535
Yeah, but I married someone once who
said that. Now she has half my stuff.

01:51:19.611 --> 01:51:22.012
-- I don't want your stuff.
-- You say that now.

01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:24.572
Natalie introduced me to this
woman who works in the building.

01:51:24.649 --> 01:51:25.946
Did you make a pass at her?

01:51:26.017 --> 01:51:28.486
-- Again, there's the asking
of the questions. -- Did you?

01:51:28.553 --> 01:51:30.647
-- I don't even think people say
"make a pass" anymore.

01:51:30.722 --> 01:51:31.746
I just did.

01:51:31.823 --> 01:51:33.985
I didn't make a pass at her.
You know why?

01:51:39.898 --> 01:51:42.333
I guess my point was that it was
unseasonably hot in Denver.

-- Was it a record?
-- No.

01:51:43.635 --> 01:51:45.069
-- Then I don't care.
-- That's <i>okay.</i>

01:51:45.136 --> 01:51:47.730
<i>In fact, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have
cared even if it had been a record.</i>

01:51:47.805 --> 01:51:49.569
There was record rainfall
in Katmandu.

01:51:49.641 --> 01:51:51.575
Are you sensitive
about being a weather nerd?

01:51:51.643 --> 01:51:54.237
I mean, if I make fun of your being a
weather nerd, will it hurt your feelings?

01:51:54.312 --> 01:51:56.406

01:51:56.481 --> 01:51:58.415
-- Actually, yeah.
-- Where's 20B?

Natalie, are you able to distinguish
between conversations we have in private

01:52:21.706 --> 01:52:23.538
and conversations we have
in a roomful of people?

01:52:23.608 --> 01:52:24.939
Also, she's secretly in love
with Casey.

01:52:25.009 --> 01:52:28.070

to be over so bad.

01:52:28.146 --> 01:52:29.773

So then I started going out on
a couple of dates with Elaine,

01:52:45.897 --> 01:52:47.865
and now it would be wrong for me
to call this girl and ask her out

01:52:47.932 --> 01:52:50.993
-- even though Natalie keeps telling
her that I'm gonna. -- Telling who?

Trainer Tubby Licht said
he thought Fool's Ransom

01:53:17.261 --> 01:53:19.355
could run the table
and win the Triple Crown.

01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:20.989
Fool's Ransom declined
to comment.

01:53:51.329 --> 01:53:52.421
Sure.

I'm riding in the elevator
with Natalie,

01:53:59.637 --> 01:54:01.628
Natalie says,
"Oh, hey, Rebecca."

01:54:01.706 --> 01:54:03.470
And Natalie wasn't talking
to you?

01:54:03.541 --> 01:54:05.009
No. I think she was talking
to Rebecca.

01:54:05.076 --> 01:54:07.135
-- 'Cause I thought maybe you
had a new nickname. -- I don't.

01:54:07.211 --> 01:54:09.737
-- So if I shout, “Yo, Rebecca,“
you won't turn around? -- No.

01:54:09.814 --> 01:54:10.975
What about "Becky"?

01:54:11.049 --> 01:54:13.882

14 floors, she gets off --

-- Rebecca.

"Natalie, she seemed nice."

Couple days later,
Natalie tells me

01:54:19.624 --> 01:54:22.355
that Rebecca really liked me
and that I should call her,

01:54:22.427 --> 01:54:23.690

to either Rebecca or Natalie,

now entered the story.

-- No. I have other advice.
-- What?

Dana's not fielding
any more questions right now.

He's in with J.J.

-- I didn't think it was so bad.
-- No.

Who do you think the source is
on the quote?

01:56:57.248 --> 01:56:59.376
-- Danny thinks it's Luther.
-- It's Luther.

-- <i>Who do you think it is?</i>

01:57:04.288 --> 01:57:06.256
Oh, I think it's Luther. I'm
just saying you're both idiots.

01:57:06.324 --> 01:57:07.314
Let's go in there.

01:57:07.391 --> 01:57:08.415
He's in a meeting.

01:57:08.492 --> 01:57:10.017
I think we should join
the meeting.

01:57:10.094 --> 01:57:11.687
I don't think we were invited
to the meeting.

01:57:11.762 --> 01:57:13.093
Perhaps he didn't know
we were available.

01:57:13.164 --> 01:57:14.359
<i>He's right.</i>

01:57:14.432 --> 01:57:16.298
Knock on the door and say
you're looking for a pencil.

01:57:16.367 --> 01:57:17.835
No, no.
A pencil's too obvious.

01:57:17.902 --> 01:57:20.200
-- Yeah, you're right. We need
something a -- -- A staple remover!

01:57:20.271 --> 01:57:21.898

What are you doing?

01:57:25.643 --> 01:57:28.613
I was trying a magic trick on the off chance
that the two of you would burst into flame.

01:57:29.947 --> 01:57:31.176
No luck.

01:57:31.249 --> 01:57:32.512
Yeah.

-- Isaac, you -- -- When
I'm upset, you'll know it.

Don't worry about it.

01:59:03.574 --> 01:59:04.564

he's by himself in his office.

interested in advising me

on how I can get Gordon
not to break up with me?

-- He's not, but he'll do it anyway.
-- Why?

'Cause he's secretly
in love with you.

01:59:37.508 --> 01:59:39.442
-- He's not. -- He's only
pretending he's not.

you and I.

he's not so I think he is,

but he's not,
but he thinks he is,

01:59:45.583 --> 01:59:47.608

because I'm in love with Gordon.

a staple remover.

Listen, you have
every right to be mad,

02:00:06.804 --> 02:00:08.772
but before you say anything,
can I just speak?

02:00:08.839 --> 02:00:09.772
Sure.

02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:11.399
Here's the thing --

02:00:11.475 --> 02:00:13.876
I did tell Natalie that I liked you
when I met you in the elevator,

02:00:13.944 --> 02:00:16.208
and I did tell Natalie
that I was gonna call you,

02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:19.477
but then, like a day later, I went out
on a date with this woman named Elaine,

02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:21.109
and then I went out
on another date with her,

02:00:21.185 --> 02:00:23.381
and it's gotten a little serious,
which is why I never called you.

02:00:23.454 --> 02:00:25.889
But I wanted to come up here
and tell you that personally,

02:00:25.956 --> 02:00:28.653
first of all 'cause I thought
it was the menschy thing to do,

02:00:28.726 --> 02:00:31.661
and second of all
because I really did like you

02:00:31.729 --> 02:00:33.493
when I met you
in the elevator.

02:00:33.564 --> 02:00:35.498
Now you should feel free
to yell at me.

02:00:35.566 --> 02:00:36.965
Who the hell are you?

02:00:37.034 --> 02:00:38.126
It's me.

-- Is this a joke?
-- No.

-- It isn't?
-- No.

02:00:41.372 --> 02:00:42.635
I'm not that good with jokes.

02:00:42.706 --> 02:00:44.697
You don't have to be good with jokes.
This isn't a joke.

to this?

Yeah, they're going
as fast as they can,

I...honestly can't remember.

Yes.

In fact, she...
barely remembered who I was.

02:02:16.834 --> 02:02:17.995
That must've been awkward.

02:02:18.068 --> 02:02:19.194
Indeed it was.

from the elevator?

was playing a practical joke.

Who's Jennifer?

02:02:27.111 --> 02:02:29.546
Who cares?
I was standin' up there.

02:02:29.613 --> 02:02:31.581

in a big 0l' way, yes,

I want you to take note
right now --

02:02:36.987 --> 02:02:39.046
lam not asking you
what your real problem is.

02:02:39.123 --> 02:02:41.751
My real problem
is that I seem to have made

02:02:41.825 --> 02:02:44.260

in the elevator.

<i>And then I was talking
to her just now...</i>

02:02:47.231 --> 02:02:50.064
being cute as a button, thinking that
she'd say, “Hey, listen, I don't --“

02:02:50.134 --> 02:02:52.796
“VVell, as long as you came all the way
up here, how about a date for lunoh?“

02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:54.269
-- Something along those lines.
-- Yeah.

02:02:54.338 --> 02:02:56.932
Yeah, but the reason you went
up there was to tell her

02:02:57.007 --> 02:02:58.907
you couldn't go outwith her
in the first place.

02:02:58.976 --> 02:03:00.569
Right now that seems
beside the point.

02:03:00.644 --> 02:03:01.873
Does that look like
he ran the caution?

02:03:01.946 --> 02:03:03.812
No. They're moving
on the outside.

02:03:03.881 --> 02:03:05.975
Yeah.
That's what I thought.

02:03:06.050 --> 02:03:07.950
I'm gonna go talk
to her again.

02:03:08.018 --> 02:03:08.951
Okay.

02:03:09.019 --> 02:03:11.044
I'm gonna stay here
and do our job.

02:03:14.425 --> 02:03:17.224
Is there a message you want me
to deliver to Luther?

02:03:17.294 --> 02:03:19.092
No message
I want you to deliver.

02:03:19.163 --> 02:03:20.927
Isaac, I'm on your team.

02:03:20.998 --> 02:03:23.968
You know, I know you don't think of me
that way, but I am a good go-between.

02:03:24.034 --> 02:03:25.798
I don't need a go-between,
J.J.

02:03:25.869 --> 02:03:28.804
Luther isn't hiding out in the
mountains with the rebel army.

02:03:28.872 --> 02:03:29.771
Isaac...

02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:31.399
-- This has got to stop, J.J.
-- I agree.

02:03:31.475 --> 02:03:33.876
I worked on newspapers
for 23 years,

02:03:33.944 --> 02:03:35.241
-- and I know
how to read one.

02:03:35.312 --> 02:03:37.303
-- Isaac... -- More to do
with problems on camera?

02:03:37.381 --> 02:03:38.940
That's not good for the show.

02:03:39.016 --> 02:03:40.313
That's not good for CSC,

02:03:40.384 --> 02:03:44.082
it's not good for Continental Corp,
and it's not good for Luther.

02:03:44.154 --> 02:03:46.316
Give him that message.

02:03:47.424 --> 02:03:49.153
You know,
I wish you'd use me more.

02:03:49.226 --> 02:03:50.751
You know,
I think I could help.

02:03:52.830 --> 02:03:54.594
I suppose you're right.

02:03:57.167 --> 02:03:59.602
Oh, uh, my fiancée is
back in town.

02:03:59.670 --> 02:04:01.434
Do you mind if I bring her
to watch the show tonight?

02:04:01.505 --> 02:04:03.803
I don't mind.

02:04:03.874 --> 02:04:05.364

02:04:12.650 --> 02:04:14.243
-- Hello.
-- Hey, Don.

02:04:14.318 --> 02:04:15.808
-- Dan.
-- Dan.

02:04:15.886 --> 02:04:18.355
I just came back because I felt
bad about our first meeting.

02:04:18.422 --> 02:04:20.618
-- In the elevator? -- No,
that meeting I felt good about

02:04:20.691 --> 02:04:22.955
until our second meeting,
which I felt bad about.

02:04:23.027 --> 02:04:25.689
VVell, Dan, there's really no need to
feel bad about any of our meetings.

02:04:25.763 --> 02:04:28.289
That's easy for you to say. You
don't remember any of our meetings.

02:04:28.365 --> 02:04:29.696
It was 10 seconds
in an elevator.

02:04:29.767 --> 02:04:30.996
Yeah, but you've seen me
on TV.

02:04:31.068 --> 02:04:32.365
When have I seen you on TV?

02:04:32.436 --> 02:04:33.528
I'm Dan Rydell.

02:04:33.604 --> 02:04:35.129
And we're back
to the starting gate.

02:04:35.205 --> 02:04:36.001
Good evening.
From New York City,

02:04:36.073 --> 02:04:38.337
I'm Dan Rydell
alongside Casey McCall.

02:04:38.409 --> 02:04:40.844
I'm that Dan Rydell --
"Sports Night."

02:04:40.911 --> 02:04:42.845
Oh! I've never seen
"Sports Night."

02:04:42.913 --> 02:04:45.143
Don't you work for CSC?

02:04:45.215 --> 02:04:48.674
I work for Continental Corp, so I do
work for CSC, but I'm an analyst.

02:04:48.752 --> 02:04:50.379
They don't make me watch
the show.

02:04:50.454 --> 02:04:52.183
[Laughs]

02:04:52.256 --> 02:04:55.191
There are people
who watch it voluntarily.

02:04:55.259 --> 02:04:56.420
I'm sure there are.

02:04:57.428 --> 02:04:58.486
It's a good show.

02:04:58.562 --> 02:05:00.496
Yeah, I like the part
where you said your names.

02:05:00.564 --> 02:05:02.828
-- We do more than that.
-- I would think.

02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:05.801
Anyway, like I said,
but for this woman Elaine,

02:05:05.869 --> 02:05:07.860
I definitely would've
called you.

02:05:07.938 --> 02:05:11.875
Well, thanks for stopping by.

02:05:13.110 --> 02:05:14.771
You bet.

02:05:20.617 --> 02:05:21.584
Hi.

02:05:21.652 --> 02:05:23.245
[Laughing]
I really do have to work here.

02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:25.846
No, listen, I was just
thinking -- I really like you.

02:05:25.923 --> 02:05:28.449
I mean, these little conversations
have been kind of fun,

02:05:28.525 --> 02:05:31.222
and I was wondering if you'd like
to maybe have a drink later.

02:05:31.295 --> 02:05:34.060
Oh, that's --
that's really sweet of you.

02:05:34.131 --> 02:05:35.724
But no, thanks.

02:05:35.799 --> 02:05:37.893
This thing with Elaine
isn't that serious.

02:05:37.968 --> 02:05:39.902
-- Who's Elaine?
-- Exactly.

02:05:39.970 --> 02:05:41.734
Dan, I-| really have
got work to do.

02:05:41.805 --> 02:05:44.069
-- Look, do you want --
-- Dan, I'm flattered, honestly,

02:05:44.141 --> 02:05:47.406
but I'm just not interested.

02:05:47.478 --> 02:05:49.810
Hey, you don't have to
hit me over the head.

02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:51.041
[Both chuckle]

02:05:51.115 --> 02:05:53.243
At least you don't have to
do it seven or eight times.

02:05:53.317 --> 02:05:54.978
It was good talking to you.

02:05:55.052 --> 02:05:56.816
Yeah, it was a real clambake.

02:05:56.887 --> 02:05:59.822
I'm gonna go scrape
my self-image off the floor

02:05:59.890 --> 02:06:02.951
and then get ready to do
my show, which, um, by the way,

02:06:03.026 --> 02:06:05.256
can be seen every night
on your network.

02:06:05.329 --> 02:06:06.763
I'll keep an eye out for it.

02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:07.991
Excellent.

02:06:27.418 --> 02:06:28.510
What?

02:06:28.585 --> 02:06:30.519
I just thought of
a funny visual.

02:06:30.587 --> 02:06:32.180
I may need more time
in the 20s.

02:06:32.256 --> 02:06:34.156
-- I can take it out of Seattle.
-- Thanks.

02:06:34.224 --> 02:06:35.350
Don't you want to know
my funny visual?

02:06:35.426 --> 02:06:37.758
Does it have to do with
the Zamboni?

02:06:37.828 --> 02:06:39.990
-- How did you know?
-- 'Cause you like Zambonis.

02:06:40.063 --> 02:06:41.622
Everybody likes Zambonis.

02:06:41.698 --> 02:06:44.133
-- Uh, <i>I</i> think you're wrong. -- There
are people who don't like them?

02:06:44.201 --> 02:06:47.660
I wouldn't say that, but I'd say that most
people are probably indifferent toward them.

02:06:47.738 --> 02:06:49.832
Do you think I'm weird?

02:06:49.907 --> 02:06:51.466
In so many different ways.

02:06:51.542 --> 02:06:52.805
Because I like Zambonis?

02:06:57.581 --> 02:06:58.878

02:06:58.949 --> 02:07:01.077

how to keep Gordon.

02:07:01.151 --> 02:07:03.279
I don't know what to say
to him.

02:07:03.353 --> 02:07:04.821
What do you want to say
to him?

02:07:04.888 --> 02:07:07.619
Don't break up with me.

02:07:07.691 --> 02:07:09.216

02:07:09.293 --> 02:07:10.351

02:07:10.427 --> 02:07:12.361
No.
What else you got?

02:07:12.429 --> 02:07:14.693
Nothing. [Sighs]

02:07:14.765 --> 02:07:16.529
-- You're wrong.
-- No, I'm not.

02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:17.692
You've got the truth.

02:07:17.768 --> 02:07:18.997
I don't have the truth.

02:07:19.069 --> 02:07:20.559
You'd be amazed
at how attractive

02:07:20.637 --> 02:07:22.537
-- the truth can be sometimes.
-- Not for a woman.

02:07:22.606 --> 02:07:23.971
-- You're wrong.
-- The truth is,

02:07:24.041 --> 02:07:26.703
I have a job that involves me
and stimulates me

02:07:26.777 --> 02:07:29.041
and rewards me and
takes up a lot of my time,

02:07:29.112 --> 02:07:31.240
and I'm not willing to do
my job just a little bit.

02:07:31.315 --> 02:07:32.407
I want to do all of it.

02:07:32.483 --> 02:07:34.451
It's part of me,
and I am different without it,

02:07:34.518 --> 02:07:37.317
and that is who I am, and
that is who you need to love.

02:07:37.387 --> 02:07:39.253
-- Except it won't work.
-- Yes, it will.

02:07:39.323 --> 02:07:40.188

it's not good

I think she has no interest
in me at all.

02:10:12.376 --> 02:10:14.367
Got to respect her for that.

02:10:18.749 --> 02:10:21.343
I don't even know her,
and -- no joke --

02:10:21.418 --> 02:10:23.716
I -- I really like her.

02:10:25.155 --> 02:10:27.749
It's little painful to me that I'm
not gonna be seeing her tonight.

02:10:27.824 --> 02:10:28.916

02:10:28.992 --> 02:10:30.517
You understand
what I'm saying?

02:10:32.095 --> 02:10:34.587
Truthfully?
Yes, I do.

Good evening.
From New York City,

02:10:38.168 --> 02:10:40.865
I'm Dan Rydell
alongside Casey McCall.

02:10:40.937 --> 02:10:43.872
<i>Bats and balls, balls and
strikes -- let's play ball.</i>

02:10:43.940 --> 02:10:45.669
<i>It's time
for spring training.</i>
