<i>- LUCIFER: Previously on Lucifer...
- Container went missing.</i>

00:03.692 --> 00:05.678
<i>Security cameras were disabled.</i>

00:06.324 --> 00:07.324
What container?

00:07.419 --> 00:08.653
The container.

00:08.997 --> 00:10.214
Your return to the Underworld

00:10.366 --> 00:11.795
has been requested.

00:11.796 --> 00:12.796
Remind Dad

00:12.915 --> 00:14.697
<i>that I quit Hell because
I was sick and tired</i>

00:14.698 --> 00:16.126

<i>CHLOE: There was a case, a
shooting on Palmetto Street.</i>

00:18.359 --> 00:19.258
<i>Malcom got shot</i>

00:19.326 --> 00:20.526
meeting up with some gang members.

00:20.594 --> 00:22.362
Paolucci thinks he took
the bullet like a hero.

00:22.429 --> 00:23.730
I think he was on the take.

00:23.797 --> 00:24.564
<i>Now,</i>

00:24.631 --> 00:26.299
no one wants to work with me.

00:27.368 --> 00:30.570
You give me what is mine!

00:30.637 --> 00:31.771
Oh, God.

00:31.839 --> 00:32.972
Who stole them?

00:33.040 --> 00:34.140
They were yours.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.575
No, don't!

LUCIFER: Hello, Sergei.

02:22.583 --> 02:23.783
Waters a bit rough, are they?

02:23.851 --> 02:25.885
What-what the hell are you doing?

02:25.953 --> 02:26.953
Isn't it obvious?

02:26.987 --> 02:28.554
I'm going to brutally torture you

02:28.622 --> 02:29.655
until you give me what I want.

02:29.723 --> 02:31.157
My wings... where are they?

02:31.225 --> 02:33.960
What wings? I don't even
know what you're talking about!

02:35.028 --> 02:36.028
Why do they always

02:36.063 --> 02:38.364
insist on being so difficult?

02:38.432 --> 02:39.999
- (chuckles)
- All right.

02:40.067 --> 02:41.133
(gasps)

02:41.201 --> 02:42.268
As you can see,

02:42.336 --> 02:43.236
I'm not playing,

02:43.303 --> 02:44.303
so let's try again,

02:44.304 --> 02:45.805
shall we?

02:45.873 --> 02:47.473
My wings, please.

02:47.541 --> 02:49.542
Look, man, why would I take your wings?

02:49.610 --> 02:51.277
I don't even know who you are!

02:51.345 --> 02:53.179
I'm Lucifer Morningstar.

02:53.247 --> 02:55.147
And you, you small-peckered fool,

02:55.215 --> 02:57.550
are Sergei Bok, a known smuggler.

02:57.618 --> 02:58.738
You move just about anything

02:58.785 --> 03:00.419
you can get your trashy Euro hands on.

03:00.487 --> 03:01.487
Please, man!

03:01.522 --> 03:02.655
I don't have 'em!

03:02.723 --> 03:03.890
I swear.

03:03.957 --> 03:06.455
Okay? I don't know
what I'd do with a pair...

03:06.493 --> 03:08.427
Maybe if I hit him a few times?

03:08.495 --> 03:10.596
Though I hate to say it,

03:10.664 --> 03:12.932
I'm not sure violence is the trick here.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.600
I'm beginning to wonder

03:14.668 --> 03:16.836
if this human stain is
actually telling the truth.

03:16.904 --> 03:18.337
No! He's scum.

03:18.405 --> 03:19.939
He'll say anything.

03:20.007 --> 03:21.574
Maybe it's not him, it's us.

03:21.642 --> 03:22.742
Us?

03:22.809 --> 03:25.111
He's the fifth man we've
accosted this week.

03:25.178 --> 03:27.079
Perhaps we're... dare I say it...

03:27.147 --> 03:29.115
going about this wrong?

03:29.182 --> 03:30.383
(sighs)

03:30.450 --> 03:33.286
It may be time to seek
the help of a professional.

03:33.353 --> 03:34.720
(sighs)

03:34.788 --> 03:36.556
Oh!

03:36.623 --> 03:38.558
Maze!

03:39.626 --> 03:40.793
(gasps)

03:42.963 --> 03:43.963
(coughing)

03:46.833 --> 03:48.034
Hey.

03:48.101 --> 03:49.302
I don't know that you
want to be here right now.

03:49.369 --> 03:50.503
DETECTIVE: There she is.

03:50.571 --> 03:53.139
Yeah. What, do I have a
"hate me" sign on my face?

03:53.206 --> 03:54.974
If only it were that simple.

03:55.042 --> 03:56.742
It's about Malcolm.

03:56.810 --> 03:57.810
What about him?

03:57.878 --> 03:59.679
They guy's been in a coma for months.

03:59.746 --> 04:01.847
His wife decided to pull the plug.

04:02.916 --> 04:04.317
Malcolm's dying today,

04:04.384 --> 04:07.253
and you're still
investigating him for corruption.

04:07.321 --> 04:08.601
So, what, they hate me even more

04:08.622 --> 04:09.989
now that I won't put a halo on his head?

04:10.057 --> 04:11.057
Maybe stay away

04:11.058 --> 04:12.692
from the precinct tonight.

04:12.759 --> 04:14.727
Cops are staging a living wake here.

04:14.795 --> 04:15.928
Anything else?

04:21.301 --> 04:23.202
It would make everyone's life easier

04:23.270 --> 04:25.338
if you would close your investigation.

04:25.405 --> 04:26.672
You know, Dan, I
thought we were actually

04:26.740 --> 04:28.374
making progress there for a second,

04:28.442 --> 04:31.718
but once again, look
who's on Team Everyone Else.

04:32.145 --> 04:33.185
I'm trying to protect you.

04:33.246 --> 04:34.313
From what?

04:34.381 --> 04:36.248
Catching a criminal or hurting your rep?

04:37.417 --> 04:38.584
It's not about any of that.

04:38.652 --> 04:39.952
It's about Malcolm's family.

04:40.020 --> 04:42.254
If there's an open
investigation calling for his dismissal,

04:42.322 --> 04:43.522
it can cost them his benefits,

04:43.557 --> 04:44.890
his pension, all of it.

04:44.958 --> 04:47.026
So, what, you want me to just drop it?

04:47.094 --> 04:49.795
Just turn my back on
everything I stand for?

04:49.863 --> 04:51.097
No.

04:51.164 --> 04:52.865
I'm saying if you want to
do something about it,

04:52.933 --> 04:53.933
then do it now.

04:53.934 --> 04:56.235
You have 24 hours.

04:56.303 --> 04:58.571
Or let it go and let his family move on.

05:18.558 --> 05:21.397
Is this really what you
do in your spare time?

05:21.662 --> 05:23.729
How fascinatingly morose.

05:23.797 --> 05:25.431
Do you ever think of taking up knitting?

05:26.533 --> 05:27.767
What are you doing here?

05:27.834 --> 05:31.270
I'm here because I could
really use your expertise.

05:31.338 --> 05:33.339
You're not busy, are you?

05:33.407 --> 05:34.974
Actually, shocker, I am busy.

05:35.042 --> 05:36.876
And it's really not a good day

05:36.943 --> 05:38.844
for... your... Luciferness.

05:38.912 --> 05:39.979
Hmm?

05:40.047 --> 05:41.280
Here's an idea.

05:41.348 --> 05:42.581
- Call next time.
- No, no, no.

05:42.649 --> 05:44.717
Hold on.

05:44.785 --> 05:47.687
Now, I'm not one to get into
the feels, usually, but...

05:47.754 --> 05:49.889
you seem genuinely distressed.

05:50.957 --> 05:51.724
You okay?

05:51.792 --> 05:53.125
Do you want to... I don't know...

05:53.193 --> 05:55.394
chat about it or something?

05:55.462 --> 05:57.697
Sex is always on the table.

05:57.764 --> 05:58.597
(scoffs)

05:58.665 --> 05:59.865
You never quit, do you?

05:59.933 --> 06:00.666
(laughs) No.

06:00.734 --> 06:03.469
I'm simply offering an ear.

06:04.871 --> 06:06.272
Come on.

06:06.339 --> 06:07.973
(sighs)

06:08.041 --> 06:11.477
Remember the Palmetto
case I was telling you about?

06:11.545 --> 06:12.945
The case that's been consuming you,

06:13.013 --> 06:14.013
causing people to despise you,

06:14.081 --> 06:15.448
call you names... I even quarreled

06:15.515 --> 06:17.016
upon occasion because of it?

06:17.084 --> 06:18.751
No, doesn't ring a bell.

06:18.819 --> 06:19.985
(chuckles)

06:20.053 --> 06:21.813
Well, they're pressuring
me to drop the case,

06:21.855 --> 06:22.621
assume the party line,

06:22.689 --> 06:24.056
and say the guy died a hero.

06:24.124 --> 06:25.324
My spidey sense tells me

06:25.392 --> 06:27.793
dropping it's not what you want, is it?

06:27.861 --> 06:29.095
I want the truth.

06:29.162 --> 06:30.162
Well, then seek it out.

06:30.197 --> 06:31.330
You're a police officer.

06:31.398 --> 06:32.965
You don't need anyone's permission.

06:33.033 --> 06:34.266
Hmm.

06:34.334 --> 06:36.135
That's decent-ish advice.

06:36.203 --> 06:38.237
I know. I'm quite good.

06:38.305 --> 06:39.605
Anyway, now we've helped you, my turn.

06:39.673 --> 06:42.141
See, I'm working a
sort of case of my own.

06:42.209 --> 06:43.476
And it seems that I've...

06:43.543 --> 06:45.611
Well, hit a bit of a snag.

06:46.680 --> 06:47.847
A case?

06:47.914 --> 06:49.014
(chuckles) Um...

06:49.082 --> 06:50.249
What kind of case is it?

06:50.317 --> 06:51.851
Well, the nature of the investigation

06:51.918 --> 06:52.918
isn't important.

06:52.953 --> 06:54.854
I'm strictly here for
professional advice.

06:54.921 --> 06:58.090
What do you do when
your case hits a wall?

06:58.158 --> 06:59.358
Mmm.

06:59.426 --> 07:00.960
What do I do when I get stuck?

07:01.027 --> 07:02.027
Yes.

07:02.095 --> 07:04.063
Well, I grab a pair of fresh eyes...

07:04.131 --> 07:06.565
someone who's not gonna be
afraid to be honest with me,

07:06.633 --> 07:09.535
even if it's not what I want to hear.

07:09.603 --> 07:10.402
Hello.

07:10.470 --> 07:12.605
That's a brilliant idea.

07:12.672 --> 07:13.773
Yeah.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.674
It kinda is.

07:15.742 --> 07:17.109
So...

07:17.177 --> 07:19.211
maybe if you help me,

07:19.279 --> 07:20.713
I could help you.

07:20.781 --> 07:22.181
(door creaking)

07:22.249 --> 07:23.482
Could...

07:23.550 --> 07:25.151
And Bob's your uncle.

07:25.218 --> 07:26.352
Right.

07:37.464 --> 07:39.698
What are we doing here, Lucifer?

07:39.766 --> 07:42.067
I like to come here from time to time.

07:42.135 --> 07:43.803
Dip my toes in the sand,

07:43.870 --> 07:45.337
breathe the ocean air,

07:45.405 --> 07:47.339
walk down memory lane.

07:47.407 --> 07:48.574
(chuckles)

07:49.643 --> 07:51.577
You see, five years ago,

07:51.645 --> 07:53.078
when Maze and I abandoned Hell,

07:53.146 --> 07:55.815
I landed right here on this beach.

07:57.284 --> 07:59.251
This is where I flipped dear old Dad

07:59.319 --> 08:00.953
the grandest of birds.

08:02.322 --> 08:04.056
And had Maze sever my wings.

08:04.124 --> 08:06.425
And why are you telling me this?

08:06.493 --> 08:07.893
Honestly, why summon me here at all?

08:07.894 --> 08:10.696
Surely it's not just to reminisce.

08:10.764 --> 08:12.264
(chuckles)

08:13.433 --> 08:15.301
I've asked you here because
those same wings

08:15.368 --> 08:17.236
have been stolen.

08:18.505 --> 08:21.640
And I need your help to get them back.

08:25.995 --> 08:32.082
Synced and corrected by VitoSilans
- www.Addic7ed.com -

08:33.905 --> 08:35.520
- Your wings are missing?
- (chuckles)

08:35.587 --> 08:36.587
Sorry, is there an echo?

08:36.589 --> 08:37.789
Isn't that what I just said?

08:37.857 --> 08:39.625
What exactly am I
supposed to do with that news?

08:39.692 --> 08:41.226
Use your angelic powers

08:41.294 --> 08:43.361
to soar around the city and find them.

08:43.429 --> 08:44.530
I mean, really,

08:44.597 --> 08:45.697
what good's an angel

08:45.765 --> 08:47.366
if he can't help a brother out?

08:47.434 --> 08:48.967
Am I right?

08:50.437 --> 08:51.904
Luci,

08:51.971 --> 08:53.411
since your grand departure from Hell,

08:53.440 --> 08:55.941
I've been the one that's
had to patrol the gates,

08:56.009 --> 08:57.576
I've been the one keeping damned souls

08:57.644 --> 09:01.180
from slipping loose... a
job, by the way, that I loathe.

09:01.247 --> 09:02.748
- I didn't ask for that.
- But those wings

09:02.816 --> 09:04.883
out there in the human world?

09:04.951 --> 09:06.351
Luci, they're too powerful.

09:06.419 --> 09:07.753
A piece of divinity.

09:07.821 --> 09:10.022
Humanity can't handle them.

09:10.090 --> 09:11.890
And if they fall into the wrong hands...

09:11.958 --> 09:13.559
Then people might die? Yeah, I get that.

09:13.626 --> 09:15.561
Just saw a chap toss
himself off a building

09:15.628 --> 09:18.497
after a mere peek at them, so
if you're done telling me things

09:18.565 --> 09:20.466
I already know...

09:22.202 --> 09:24.736
will you help me or not?

09:24.804 --> 09:26.505
You tell me something.

09:26.573 --> 09:27.806
If you truly hated the wings,

09:27.874 --> 09:29.641
why'd you hold onto them all this time?

09:29.709 --> 09:31.810
(chuckles)

09:31.878 --> 09:34.446
- That is none of your business.
- It's a sentimental move, Luci.

09:34.514 --> 09:36.048
Especially for someone that was trying

09:36.116 --> 09:37.382
to leave their life behind.

09:37.450 --> 09:38.817
Please. Here we go.

09:38.885 --> 09:41.820
Maybe deep down you realize
you never should've cut them off.

09:41.888 --> 09:43.188
And maybe that's why

09:43.256 --> 09:45.090
you left yourself an out.

09:45.158 --> 09:46.625
Yeah.

09:46.693 --> 09:47.926
So are you done?

09:47.994 --> 09:49.962
Pretty words, but no.

09:50.029 --> 09:51.964
They're my property. I want them back.

09:52.031 --> 09:53.398
Simple as that. If I can avoid

09:53.466 --> 09:56.435
an earth-shattering
tragedy as well... bonus.

09:56.503 --> 09:58.403
You wanted free will.

10:00.240 --> 10:02.141
You wanted accountability.

10:02.208 --> 10:04.076
Well...

10:04.144 --> 10:06.979
fix your own damn mess, for once.

10:16.122 --> 10:17.489
(chuckles) I've been thinking.

10:17.557 --> 10:19.091
Your problem, my problem...

10:19.159 --> 10:22.027
why not be each other's
fresh eyes and all that?

10:22.095 --> 10:23.829
Hey, what do you say, quid pro quo?

10:23.897 --> 10:25.931
Oh, so now you need my help.

10:25.999 --> 10:27.933
Sorry, am I not enunciating today?

10:28.001 --> 10:30.636
Yes, I've come seeking
your very generous aid.

10:30.703 --> 10:32.971
First you have to tell me what
it is you're working on.

10:33.039 --> 10:34.072
(chuckles)

10:34.140 --> 10:35.774
I'm not sure you can handle it.

10:35.842 --> 10:36.842
Try me.

10:36.876 --> 10:38.810
Okay.

10:38.878 --> 10:40.212
Uh, remember that container

10:40.280 --> 10:41.813
that was so inelegantly taken from me?

10:41.881 --> 10:43.081
The one I was convinced

10:43.149 --> 10:44.850
- was hiding something?
- Yes, well, it wasn't just

10:44.918 --> 10:46.398
nesting dolls that I was looking for.

10:46.419 --> 10:49.788
There was something
else, something... personal

10:49.856 --> 10:51.423
that was missing when we got there.

10:51.491 --> 10:52.624
I knew it.

10:52.692 --> 10:54.893
Lucifer, what was in there?

10:54.961 --> 10:57.563
My angel wings.

10:57.630 --> 10:58.630
(laughs)

10:58.665 --> 10:59.765
(chuckles) Yeah, go on.

10:59.832 --> 11:00.899
Get it all out.

11:00.967 --> 11:01.934
(laughing) Okay, seriously,

11:02.001 --> 11:03.368
what was in there?

11:06.573 --> 11:07.973
Oh, you are serious?

11:08.041 --> 11:10.709
Oh... okay, sorry.

11:10.777 --> 11:12.244
Did someone make them for you?

11:12.312 --> 11:15.180
Or are you big into cosplay?

11:15.248 --> 11:16.381
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

11:16.449 --> 11:17.516
Sorry, I'll admit

11:17.584 --> 11:19.318
I don't always get you.

11:19.385 --> 11:21.653
But if this is really that important...

11:21.721 --> 11:23.155
It is.

11:23.223 --> 11:25.090
Okay, I will do what I can.

11:25.158 --> 11:27.993
I will put out an APB on...

11:29.329 --> 11:31.063
angel wings.

11:31.130 --> 11:32.564
Thank you, and in return,

11:32.632 --> 11:35.067
I shall donate my
services on Palmetto, all right?

11:35.134 --> 11:36.254
Sure, we could use the help.

11:36.302 --> 11:38.003
- (door opens)
- "We"?

11:38.905 --> 11:40.205
- Hey.
- Ready to go?

11:40.273 --> 11:42.074
Yeah, you weren't around to help,

11:42.141 --> 11:43.642
so I recruited someone else.

11:43.710 --> 11:44.710
The more, the merrier.

11:44.744 --> 11:45.744
You're helping her?

11:45.745 --> 11:47.913
I knew she wouldn't give it up.

11:47.981 --> 11:49.081
And I couldn't let her go it alone,

11:49.148 --> 11:51.550
so I'm here for the ride.

11:51.618 --> 11:52.784
Hmm.

11:52.852 --> 11:54.019
Cool.

11:54.087 --> 11:55.721
The three of us working together.

11:55.788 --> 11:57.356
Yes, cool.

11:57.423 --> 11:59.057
What could be better?

12:00.693 --> 12:04.096
♪ Bursting inside ♪

12:04.163 --> 12:05.897
♪ It's getting harder to hide... ♪

12:05.965 --> 12:08.967
So, this is Palmetto Street.

12:10.503 --> 12:12.437
I'm sorry, why is he here again?

12:12.505 --> 12:15.774
Uh, he helps me see things differently.

12:15.842 --> 12:19.411
Yes, I've proved
myself quite useful, Dan.

12:19.479 --> 12:21.513
So, how can we help you?

12:21.581 --> 12:23.148
All right, I want to
reenact the shooting.

12:23.216 --> 12:24.616
I want to figure out what I missed.

12:24.617 --> 12:25.817
How's that gonna prove anything?

12:25.885 --> 12:28.687
- Just humor me, thanks.
- (chuckles)

12:28.755 --> 12:30.856
- Lucifer?
- Yes?

12:30.923 --> 12:32.424
You will represent the seedy

12:32.492 --> 12:33.825
criminal element.

12:33.893 --> 12:35.827
Oh, I believe you mean handsome
criminal element.

12:35.895 --> 12:37.596
- (Dan scoffs)
- And, Dan,

12:37.664 --> 12:39.698
you will stand for Malcolm.

12:39.766 --> 12:40.766
The tough as nails cop,

12:40.833 --> 12:41.933
who wishes I would

12:42.001 --> 12:43.435
leave this stupid case alone.

12:43.503 --> 12:44.870
Ah, cute.

12:44.937 --> 12:46.271
And I will play myself.

12:46.339 --> 12:48.907
A chick who cannot figure
out what the hell I saw.

12:48.975 --> 12:50.342
So in the months leading
up to the shooting,

12:50.410 --> 12:52.277
we were following a
French drug trafficker

12:52.345 --> 12:53.545
Nikolas Aoudi.

12:53.613 --> 12:54.813
Ooh, can I have a gun?

12:54.881 --> 12:56.615
I feel like Nikolas would
definitely have a gun.

12:56.683 --> 12:57.883
No...

12:57.950 --> 12:59.151
Actually he was more of a hammer guy.

12:59.218 --> 13:00.619
Liked to break fingers and arms.

13:00.687 --> 13:02.187
- Okay...
- Some legs and teeth.

13:02.255 --> 13:04.389
Right. Can I have a hammer, then?

13:04.457 --> 13:07.125
Somehow Aoudi kept evading the LAPD.

13:07.193 --> 13:09.313
I arrested one of his
guys, thought he was gonna flip.

13:09.329 --> 13:11.063
Then suddenly he changed his tune.

13:11.130 --> 13:13.265
The only cop who spoke
to him was Malcolm.

13:13.333 --> 13:14.333
So...

13:14.334 --> 13:17.069
one night, I tracked him here,

13:17.136 --> 13:19.237
sneaking in through the side door.

13:19.305 --> 13:22.074
And I hid behind this glass.

13:22.141 --> 13:24.176
I could see them.

13:24.243 --> 13:26.445
<i>It was Malcolm and
Aoudi and his bodyguard.</i>

13:26.512 --> 13:29.047
<i>They, they looked like
they were making a deal.</i>

13:29.115 --> 13:31.249
<i>Malcolm was holding cash.</i>

13:31.317 --> 13:32.584
Hold on.

13:32.652 --> 13:34.653
(grunts) Ooh, is that enough?

13:34.721 --> 13:36.788
CHLOE: A bribe, maybe.

13:36.856 --> 13:38.757
I'm not sure.

13:38.825 --> 13:41.159
<i>But I leaned forward to
hear what they were saying.</i>

13:41.227 --> 13:42.961
<i>- (glass rattles)
- And accidentally,</i>

13:43.029 --> 13:44.029
<i>I made a sound.</i>

13:44.097 --> 13:45.097
<i>I-I could feel it.</i>

13:45.164 --> 13:46.932
<i>He saw me, but he didn't react.</i>

13:46.999 --> 13:49.234
<i>He just went back to his conversation.</i>

13:49.302 --> 13:50.662
<i>And that's when the shot went off.</i>

13:50.703 --> 13:52.137
(gunshots)

13:52.205 --> 13:53.872
<i>It didn't take long before bullets
were flying everywhere.</i>

13:53.940 --> 13:56.241
<i>I braced behind the door,</i>

13:56.309 --> 13:58.610
<i>and that's when I ran in.</i>

13:58.678 --> 14:00.912
<i>Aoudi and his man were dead.</i>

14:00.980 --> 14:03.782
<i>Malcolm was on the floor, bleeding out.</i>

14:06.953 --> 14:08.820
There was nothing you could do.

14:14.093 --> 14:15.927
It doesn't make sense.

14:15.995 --> 14:17.028
Excuse me?

14:17.096 --> 14:18.530
Aoudi would have no
desire to kill Malcolm.

14:18.598 --> 14:21.299
Trust me, if there's one
thing I know, it's desire.

14:21.367 --> 14:24.636
I mean, if Malcolm were indeed corrupt,

14:24.704 --> 14:26.037
he'd be Aoudi's golden goose.

14:26.105 --> 14:27.672
It'd be quite dumb to shoot him.

14:27.740 --> 14:29.307
What if someone else was here?

14:29.375 --> 14:31.943
The cops searched the
place up and down, Chloe.

14:32.011 --> 14:33.345
There was no one else.

14:33.413 --> 14:36.615
Look, you may not want to believe it,

14:36.682 --> 14:38.517
but what if...?

14:38.584 --> 14:39.584
I was wrong.

14:39.585 --> 14:42.554
(cell phone ringing)

14:42.622 --> 14:44.423
Espinoza.

14:44.490 --> 14:45.924
Uh, yeah.

14:45.992 --> 14:48.894
Okay, I will let her know.

14:48.961 --> 14:50.162
Did you really put out

14:50.229 --> 14:53.432
an APB for... angel wings?

14:55.535 --> 14:57.002
Maybe.

14:57.069 --> 14:59.571
Well, it looks like they got a hit.

14:59.639 --> 15:00.906
Excellent!

15:00.973 --> 15:02.941
Right, my turn.

15:06.068 --> 15:08.326
I still can't believe
it that the wings are...

15:08.394 --> 15:09.861
Real? Exquisite? Divine?

15:09.928 --> 15:11.329
It's okay to say it.

15:11.397 --> 15:12.897
I was gonna say, "For sale."

15:12.965 --> 15:15.500
So, anything else the
FBI can tell us, Agent Pitts?

15:15.567 --> 15:17.327
The wings... along with
a bunch of other crap

15:17.336 --> 15:19.270
people think is
real... are being pawned off

15:19.338 --> 15:21.005
at a black-market antiquities auction.

15:21.073 --> 15:22.306
An auction?

15:22.374 --> 15:24.108
Held under the veil of a
charity event at Crimson Hall.

15:24.176 --> 15:25.276
Saints' teeth?

15:25.344 --> 15:26.577
Holy napkins?

15:26.645 --> 15:27.879
Oh, a piece of the cross?

15:27.946 --> 15:29.986
They've got my wings in
absurdly fraudulent company.

15:30.049 --> 15:33.084
Yeah, unlike the wings, there's
no way those are real.

15:33.152 --> 15:34.519
Exactly, it's insulting!

15:34.586 --> 15:36.754
Putting my wings on the block
like some chintzy accoutrement.

15:36.822 --> 15:38.022
All right.

15:38.090 --> 15:39.490
Well, you can take
comfort knowing the auction's

15:39.558 --> 15:41.726
already set to be raided tonight.

15:41.794 --> 15:43.728
So the FBI are gonna snatch my wings?

15:43.796 --> 15:45.363
When we get a chance to
pounce on the bad guys, we take it.

15:45.431 --> 15:46.931
The FBI is taking lead.

15:46.999 --> 15:48.399
Figured you might
be after the same guys.

15:48.467 --> 15:50.234
And we have jurisdiction.

15:50.302 --> 15:52.770
Okay, so how do we get the wings back?

15:52.838 --> 15:53.938
After the raid?

15:54.006 --> 15:55.373
As long as you can
prove the wings' provenance,

15:55.441 --> 15:56.774
you'll get it back in 30 days.

15:56.842 --> 15:58.676
- No problem.
- 30 days.

15:58.744 --> 16:00.878
Yes, no problem, no problem at all.

16:00.946 --> 16:01.979
Right?

16:02.047 --> 16:04.182
(quietly) Mm-hmm.

16:06.785 --> 16:08.720
♪ ♪

16:18.430 --> 16:19.964
(elevator bell dings)

16:25.170 --> 16:27.205
(laughs)

16:27.272 --> 16:29.407
Come on out, Amenadiel.

16:32.144 --> 16:34.412
So what happened to going it alone,

16:34.480 --> 16:35.947
lying in my own mess and such?

16:36.014 --> 16:37.949
Or did you just want a
front row seat to the action?

16:38.016 --> 16:39.150
I assure you, Lucifer,

16:39.218 --> 16:40.918
I take no pleasure
in following you around.

16:40.986 --> 16:43.988
But this is far too
important to let you screw up.

16:44.056 --> 16:46.657
Ah, so you just came to help?

16:46.725 --> 16:49.360
I came to ensure the wings
get back where they belong.

16:49.428 --> 16:51.062
Which is where exactly?

16:51.130 --> 16:52.463
You mean besides on your back?

16:52.531 --> 16:54.011
Oh, surely, my fine-feathered friend,

16:54.066 --> 16:55.466
you don't expect that to happen.

16:55.534 --> 16:58.636
They belong in the
Heavens where they were created.

16:58.704 --> 17:01.572
If you don't want them,
that's where they'll be.

17:01.640 --> 17:04.342
Fair enough.

17:04.409 --> 17:06.010
Considering we're on a clock now,

17:06.078 --> 17:07.078
I could use a wingman.

17:07.079 --> 17:08.913
What do you mean?

17:08.981 --> 17:10.748
The FBI's raiding the place.

17:10.816 --> 17:13.885
So if we don't get the
wings, humanity finds divinity,

17:13.952 --> 17:15.987
so on and so forth... you know the rest.

17:16.054 --> 17:17.688
Well, we can't let that happen.

17:17.756 --> 17:19.857
Right, so you can join.

17:19.925 --> 17:21.259
Provided, of course, you can keep

17:21.326 --> 17:23.394
that angelic ego of yours in check.

17:23.462 --> 17:24.694
I don't have an ego.

17:24.762 --> 17:26.964
Sure you do, but I'm encouraging
you to get off

17:27.031 --> 17:29.233
that high horse and learn a
thing or two about humanity.

17:29.301 --> 17:32.336
Though it appears that
you've picked up a fashion sense.

17:32.404 --> 17:33.638
So that's, uh... (sighs)

17:33.705 --> 17:35.973
I miss the dress.

17:37.509 --> 17:39.043
(beeping)

17:41.847 --> 17:43.181
Hello.

17:43.248 --> 17:44.015
Private party.

17:44.082 --> 17:46.818
(stammers) Honey, not vinegar.

17:47.853 --> 17:49.620
Yes, excuse me, I understand

17:49.688 --> 17:50.955
this event is very exclusive.

17:51.023 --> 17:54.826
But, uh, surely you've got room for just

17:54.893 --> 17:56.427
two more?

17:58.130 --> 18:00.832
Unless you got business here, scram.

18:06.171 --> 18:08.573
It's funny you
should say that, actually.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.875
Perhaps I do have
something that might interest

18:10.943 --> 18:13.945
those keen on religious relics.

18:20.352 --> 18:21.586
Right this way, gentlemen.

18:21.653 --> 18:23.321
Thank you.

18:23.388 --> 18:25.523
Did you catch all that?

18:31.029 --> 18:32.909
CHLOE: (sighs) I can't
believe I agreed to this.

18:32.965 --> 18:34.532
I thought you were helping me.

18:34.600 --> 18:35.733
I am helping.

18:35.801 --> 18:36.968
We went to Palmetto, right?

18:37.035 --> 18:38.336
We went over everything that happened.

18:38.403 --> 18:41.038
- And found nothing.
- Exactly.

18:41.106 --> 18:43.975
Now I want to show you
who your case is about.

18:44.042 --> 18:45.776
(sighs)

18:45.844 --> 18:48.112
This is who's on the
other end of this case.

18:48.180 --> 18:49.780
Not a monster.

18:49.848 --> 18:50.982
Not a villain.

18:51.049 --> 18:53.818
But a grieving family
trying to say goodbye.

18:55.053 --> 18:57.021
(groans) She saw us.

19:01.426 --> 19:03.127
What is she doing here?

19:03.195 --> 19:04.262
I'm sorry, Mel.

19:04.329 --> 19:06.163
She's not, she's
not looking for a fight.

19:06.231 --> 19:07.999
(scoffs) Are you kidding?

19:08.066 --> 19:09.300
A fight?

19:09.368 --> 19:11.168
She...

19:11.236 --> 19:14.171
You have no right.

19:14.239 --> 19:15.907
What do you want from us?

19:15.974 --> 19:17.708
(sighs)

19:17.776 --> 19:20.745
I'm-I'm so sorry for your loss.

19:20.812 --> 19:23.180
(scoffs)

19:23.248 --> 19:25.616
Just go.

19:25.684 --> 19:27.818
Please, just...

19:29.554 --> 19:31.656
(door closes)

19:33.358 --> 19:35.960
Carmen?

19:36.028 --> 19:38.129
It's like nothing I've ever seen.

19:46.038 --> 19:48.940
Congratulations, Mr. Morningstar.

19:49.007 --> 19:52.944
The Catholics and the
Satanists will be clawing for this coin.

19:53.011 --> 19:56.147
With any luck, we may
have a bidding war on our hands.

19:56.214 --> 19:57.715
Wouldn't that be fun?

19:57.783 --> 19:59.317
Who would've thought,
eh, the devil's coin,

19:59.384 --> 20:02.053
- worthy of so much love?
- Put a bunch of believers in a room

20:02.120 --> 20:05.890
and... pardon the pun... but
sky's the limit. (chuckles)

20:05.958 --> 20:07.158
(chuckles) That's very good.

20:07.225 --> 20:08.693
If I didn't know any better, I would say

20:08.760 --> 20:11.562
that you don't
respect your buyers' faith.

20:11.630 --> 20:12.997
Oh, quite the contrary.

20:13.065 --> 20:15.466
I respect my customers' faith very much.

20:15.534 --> 20:16.867
But I don't have to
share in their beliefs

20:16.935 --> 20:18.769
to profit from them. (chuckles)

20:18.837 --> 20:21.806
So I take it you're not a believer then?

20:21.873 --> 20:25.276
I'm a man that
believes in one simple divinity,

20:25.344 --> 20:27.345
the almighty dollar.

20:27.412 --> 20:28.946
(laughter)

20:31.183 --> 20:33.484
Humans.

20:33.552 --> 20:35.353
Am I right? (clears throat)

20:35.420 --> 20:37.621
I have to admit,

20:37.689 --> 20:40.958
I love being the bearer of bad news.

20:41.026 --> 20:43.094
Oh? Do tell.

20:43.161 --> 20:44.595
The coin's not for sale.

20:44.663 --> 20:47.531
I simply used it to gain entrée to you.

20:47.599 --> 20:49.600
Then why are you here?

20:49.668 --> 20:51.102
Someone stole my wings.

20:51.169 --> 20:53.704
About six feet, glow
with the light of God.

20:53.772 --> 20:57.608
So if you'd be so kind as to
deliver them, then we can be

20:57.676 --> 20:59.310
on our way without any...

20:59.378 --> 21:01.345
unpleasantries.

21:01.413 --> 21:02.880
Funny.

21:02.948 --> 21:05.716
That's not how this works.

21:05.784 --> 21:07.551
- (guns cocking)
- (chuckles)

21:07.619 --> 21:09.987
Oh, you men don't know
who you're dealing with.

21:10.055 --> 21:12.790
Those guns don't frighten us.

21:12.858 --> 21:14.358
In fact,

21:14.426 --> 21:16.660
I dare you to shoot.

21:17.264 --> 21:18.195
Brother...

21:18.263 --> 21:19.463
Go ahead.

21:19.531 --> 21:21.532
See what happens.

21:23.769 --> 21:26.931
And there's that angelic
ego I was talking about.

21:31.004 --> 21:33.939
I'm sorry, uh... You were saying?

21:34.007 --> 21:36.275
Gentlemen, please... (laughs)

21:36.343 --> 21:37.743
Don't mind my brother.

21:37.811 --> 21:39.411
He's just a bit... simple.

21:39.479 --> 21:42.148
We meant no disrespect, truly.

21:42.215 --> 21:43.566
I thought you told me
you wanted your wings back.

21:43.591 --> 21:46.452
I do. But this is
hardly the way to go about it.

21:46.520 --> 21:47.853
Give me one good reason

21:47.921 --> 21:49.722
not to finish this right now.

21:49.790 --> 21:51.590
LUCIFER: Because you misunderstood me.

21:51.658 --> 21:53.993
I'm more than happy to buy the wings,

21:54.060 --> 21:56.862
like everyone else, with cash.

21:56.930 --> 21:58.664
A whole boatload of money.

21:58.732 --> 22:00.432
If you truly worship the dollar,

22:00.500 --> 22:02.768
then I'm your ticket to divinity.

22:07.707 --> 22:10.242
Happy bidding.

22:10.310 --> 22:11.577
(sighs)

22:12.679 --> 22:13.846
Thank you.

22:19.286 --> 22:22.221
♪ Everybody knows
when, ah, tell me again ♪

22:22.289 --> 22:25.357

baby, let's pretend ♪

22:25.425 --> 22:27.960

22:28.028 --> 22:29.295
LUCIFER: It's funny,
isn't it, how all it takes

22:29.362 --> 22:31.430
to unite the faiths
of the world is a bit

22:31.498 --> 22:33.299
of illegal consumerism.

22:33.366 --> 22:34.433
Mmm.

22:34.501 --> 22:35.501
What I'd like to know

22:35.502 --> 22:38.504
is since when is the Prince of Darkness

22:38.572 --> 22:41.106
scared of some insufferable human gun?

22:41.174 --> 22:43.075
Well, since I, uh...

22:43.143 --> 22:44.376
I bled.

22:44.444 --> 22:46.579
- What do you mean, bled?
- Yep.

22:46.646 --> 22:49.281
Don't know how it's possible,
but on top of everything else,

22:49.349 --> 22:51.750
seems I'm dealing with a
bit of a mortality sitch.

22:51.818 --> 22:54.220
Hence: ixnay on the unsgay.

22:55.121 --> 22:56.655
What are you grinning about?

22:56.723 --> 22:59.792
I'm just realizing the
gravity of what you're saying.

22:59.860 --> 23:01.460
That I'm allergic to lead projectiles?

23:01.528 --> 23:03.162
That even if you don't choose Hell,

23:03.230 --> 23:08.901
all I have do is wait for some
pitiful thug to end you

23:08.969 --> 23:12.438
and right back to Hell you go.

23:14.140 --> 23:17.009
You hadn't put that one together
yet, had you, Luci?

23:18.044 --> 23:20.279
You just made my millennium.

23:20.347 --> 23:22.214
(chuckles)

23:22.282 --> 23:24.583
CARMEN: Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.

23:24.651 --> 23:26.085
I'm Carmen Grant

23:26.152 --> 23:29.555
and I humbly welcome
you to our Evening of Faith.

23:29.623 --> 23:32.091
(applause)

23:32.158 --> 23:34.026
Tonight we shall behold items

23:34.094 --> 23:36.896
that prove the miraculous is real.

23:36.963 --> 23:39.064
There is a power we can't see,

23:39.132 --> 23:41.567
but its light burns
bright in the priceless artifacts

23:41.635 --> 23:44.937
that have traveled from around the world

23:45.005 --> 23:48.140
and, dare I say, Heaven and Hell,

23:48.208 --> 23:50.342
to find their way to you!

23:50.410 --> 23:52.311
(applause)

23:55.081 --> 23:57.583
Without further ado,

23:57.651 --> 24:01.086
I would like to introduce
you to the first item up for bid...

24:01.154 --> 24:04.356
the Lost Chains of St. Paul!

24:05.625 --> 24:07.559
According to tradition,

24:07.627 --> 24:09.828
St. Paul was imprisoned

24:09.896 --> 24:11.697
between 61 and 63 AD.

24:11.765 --> 24:15.668
While some pieces are on
display at the Papal Basilica...

24:15.735 --> 24:17.536
or so they say...

24:17.604 --> 24:20.172
these are the missing links.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.574
Paul's wrists were too
thick to fit in those chains.

24:22.642 --> 24:24.944
I know. That man never could
pass on dessert, could he?

24:25.011 --> 24:26.411
He should have been the Saint of...

24:26.413 --> 24:27.579
Honey cakes?

24:27.647 --> 24:29.848
(laughing)

24:30.750 --> 24:32.918
Those are clearly fake!

24:32.986 --> 24:34.253
- What?
- Shh!

24:34.321 --> 24:35.354
Shh.

24:35.422 --> 24:37.723
Ooh. Tough crowd.

24:37.791 --> 24:40.659
You don't know the half of it.

24:40.727 --> 24:42.061
How did I know you'd come here?

24:42.128 --> 24:43.963
Because I'm admirably consistent?

24:44.030 --> 24:45.631
How did you even get in here?

24:45.699 --> 24:46.765
Oh, I've got news for you, pal.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.513
You're not the only
one with a little mojo.

24:48.535 --> 24:50.035
Mmm. Touché.

24:50.103 --> 24:51.370
And you're welcome, by the way.

24:51.438 --> 24:52.638
I came here to warn you.

24:52.706 --> 24:54.506
In about five minutes, the
FBI's gonna storm this place,

24:54.574 --> 24:55.741
so we have to go now.

24:55.809 --> 24:57.376
But we were just getting started.

24:57.444 --> 24:59.411
"We"?

24:59.479 --> 25:01.080
Oh, that's right. You
haven't met, have you?

25:01.147 --> 25:02.648
Allow me to introduce

25:02.716 --> 25:03.916
Amenadiel.

25:03.984 --> 25:04.984
My brother.

25:04.985 --> 25:06.552
Well, come on,

25:06.619 --> 25:07.820
don't look so shocked.

25:07.887 --> 25:09.355
Um...

25:09.422 --> 25:12.091
I just didn't

25:12.158 --> 25:13.993
expect your brother to be...

25:14.060 --> 25:16.595
so... handsome.

25:16.663 --> 25:18.464
AMENADIEL: We're all
full of surprises, it seems.

25:18.531 --> 25:21.934
I never expected my brother
to change careers as he did.

25:22.002 --> 25:25.137
But I'm definitely beginning to see why.

25:26.106 --> 25:28.040
Lucifer, your brother got

25:28.108 --> 25:29.675
all the charm in the family.

25:29.743 --> 25:30.943
Okay, that's enough of that.

25:31.011 --> 25:32.611
It's unsettling to
see you two get along.

25:33.446 --> 25:34.613
CARMEN: Next up.

25:36.282 --> 25:37.750
(crowd exclaiming, applauding)

25:37.817 --> 25:40.085
The wings of an angel.

25:47.761 --> 25:49.461
(whispers) They're gorgeous.

25:52.532 --> 25:53.532
MAN: Freeze! FBI!

25:53.533 --> 25:55.334
- (crowd gasps)
- MAN: What's going on?

25:55.402 --> 25:56.568
Everyone, stay where you are!

25:56.636 --> 25:57.903
Don't move!

26:00.974 --> 26:02.408
Stay where you are.

26:03.611 --> 26:04.543
BODYGUARD: Mr. Grant.

26:04.611 --> 26:05.611
Nobody move.

26:05.612 --> 26:06.645
Come on.

26:06.713 --> 26:08.981
Stop! Freeze!

26:17.457 --> 26:18.991
Where'd he go?

26:20.326 --> 26:21.894
A little help.

26:22.896 --> 26:24.430
Please.

26:26.766 --> 26:28.133
(exhales)

26:33.339 --> 26:35.441
Thank you.

27:01.935 --> 27:04.303
They're fake.

27:08.061 --> 27:10.463
I'm telling you, I saw him come in here.

27:10.530 --> 27:12.098
(indistinct radio transmission)

27:15.102 --> 27:17.903
(whispers) There was a secret door.

27:19.806 --> 27:21.307
I see you got your wings.

27:21.375 --> 27:23.075
Thought you'd be happier.

27:23.143 --> 27:24.610
These aren't my wings.

27:24.678 --> 27:26.612
Whose wings are they?

27:26.680 --> 27:28.648
Someone with a warped sense of humor.

27:28.715 --> 27:30.082
- I don't...
- They're a knockoff,

27:30.150 --> 27:31.450
a sham.

27:31.518 --> 27:33.552
I mean, it's good
work, I'll give them that.

27:33.620 --> 27:35.755
Probably would've
fooled just about anyone,

27:35.822 --> 27:38.224
save perhaps the actual
owner of the wings.

27:38.292 --> 27:40.693
The actual owner... being you?

27:40.761 --> 27:42.094
Yeah, they must've been switched out.

27:42.162 --> 27:44.163
It's no coincidence that my
wings are stolen one day,

27:44.231 --> 27:47.800
and then Carmen's selling an
exact replica a week later.

27:47.868 --> 27:49.635
No, this is some serious foul play.

27:49.703 --> 27:51.637
I-I'm sorry to hear that, sincerely.

27:51.705 --> 27:54.284
But there's something at Palmetto

27:54.438 --> 27:55.654
that I need to take care of, so...

27:55.655 --> 27:57.778
Are you coming?

27:57.844 --> 27:59.211
Didn't you hear me?

27:59.279 --> 28:00.680
My wings are still out there.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.048
I need to find them.

28:02.115 --> 28:04.083
If you want to run off to
Palmetto, be my guest,

28:04.151 --> 28:06.385
but no more role-playing for me, thanks.

28:06.453 --> 28:08.688
So I came to save your ass,
but just because these wings

28:08.755 --> 28:09.855
aren't the ones you wanted,

28:09.923 --> 28:11.490
that's it? We're done?

28:12.859 --> 28:15.594
So much for quid pro quo.

28:15.662 --> 28:17.263
Ah.

28:18.532 --> 28:20.499
You sure you don't
want to chase after her?

28:20.567 --> 28:24.170
Maybe I can ask Father for
some rain and make it a moment.

28:27.974 --> 28:30.776
All right.

28:30.844 --> 28:32.445
So what's our next move?

28:32.512 --> 28:35.548
Well, I'm afraid this is where
I leave you, brother.

28:35.615 --> 28:36.782
What I'm about to do

28:36.850 --> 28:39.251
is the Devil's work.

28:46.026 --> 28:48.961
I thought we were
finally done with all this.

28:49.029 --> 28:50.496
(sighs) I was done.

28:50.564 --> 28:52.932
I even started believing I
was crazy like everybody said.

28:52.999 --> 28:54.934
I never said you were crazy.

28:55.001 --> 28:56.836
Yeah. It's okay.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.871
I would've thought I was, too.

28:58.939 --> 29:00.773
But, you know, I got to thinking.

29:00.841 --> 29:02.875
Lucifer pointed out
that it made no sense

29:02.943 --> 29:04.777
for Aoudi to shoot his
inside man, right?

29:04.845 --> 29:06.445
Right.

29:07.514 --> 29:09.348
But no one else was there.

29:09.416 --> 29:12.518
No one could've shot Malcolm and
fled without me seeing them.

29:12.586 --> 29:13.652
- Now you're making my point.
- Because

29:13.720 --> 29:16.455
there was no obvious exit.

29:16.523 --> 29:17.556
But maybe,

29:17.624 --> 29:19.558
just maybe... hear me out...

29:19.626 --> 29:21.360
there was a secret one.

29:21.428 --> 29:24.263
Chloe, you are stabbing
hard at something

29:24.331 --> 29:26.232
- that's just not there.
- There's got to be an explanation

29:26.299 --> 29:27.933
for what I saw, Dan! There has to be.

29:28.001 --> 29:30.136
What do you need me to do?

29:30.203 --> 29:31.203
- I don't...
- (creaking)

29:34.074 --> 29:36.008
What was that?

29:36.076 --> 29:38.477
(creaking)

30:09.342 --> 30:11.277
Looks like it leads up to the street.

30:14.314 --> 30:16.315
Hey.

30:18.385 --> 30:20.352
What is it?

30:20.420 --> 30:22.021
A 999 key.

30:22.088 --> 30:23.956
LAPD-issued.

30:25.125 --> 30:26.959
Malcolm had his on him.

30:27.027 --> 30:29.795
- Wait. Are-are you saying...
- Yes.

30:29.863 --> 30:31.697
Another cop was here.

30:31.765 --> 30:33.365
- I was right.
- Chloe,

30:33.433 --> 30:34.667
- this could mean a lot of things...
- It means

30:34.734 --> 30:36.202
a cop knew

30:36.269 --> 30:38.838
this secret passageway existed, Dan.

30:38.905 --> 30:40.339
And chances are,

30:40.407 --> 30:42.308
whoever it was shot Malcolm, so...

30:42.375 --> 30:43.142
Yeah. But why?

30:43.210 --> 30:45.311
That's what I got to figure out.

30:45.378 --> 30:47.746
No.

30:47.814 --> 30:49.648
That's what we need to figure out.

31:03.396 --> 31:05.331
(doorbell rings)

31:14.674 --> 31:16.609
It's...

31:16.676 --> 31:17.843
you.

31:17.911 --> 31:19.578
That's right, me,

31:19.646 --> 31:22.281
Lucifer bloody Morningstar.

31:22.349 --> 31:24.483
Do you mind if I come in?

31:24.551 --> 31:25.684
You, Carmen,

31:25.752 --> 31:27.632
slightly more difficult
to identify, aren't you?

31:27.687 --> 31:30.089
No phone, no bank account,

31:30.156 --> 31:32.358
home registered under one
of your many aliases.

31:32.425 --> 31:35.227
Seems wings aren't the only
thing you falsify, eh?

31:35.295 --> 31:37.295
- I can explain...
- I'm still moved by your words.

31:37.297 --> 31:40.232
"I'm a man that
believes in one simple divinity,

31:40.300 --> 31:42.868
- the almighty dollar."
- You don't understand...

31:42.936 --> 31:45.604
No, I understand. Perfectly.

31:45.672 --> 31:47.206
A lifelong atheist,

31:47.274 --> 31:49.608
you took one peek at the wings

31:49.676 --> 31:52.011
and something changed in you.

31:52.078 --> 31:54.013
The great white light was revealed

31:54.080 --> 31:56.015
and a believer was born,

31:56.082 --> 32:00.419
one who couldn't
part with real divinity!

32:06.860 --> 32:08.327
(exhales)

32:09.429 --> 32:11.931
Oh, no.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.001
Mounting my wings,

32:16.069 --> 32:19.338
like some decorative stag head.

32:21.908 --> 32:24.643
(sighs)

32:24.711 --> 32:26.579
Shame on you.

32:26.646 --> 32:29.582
It wasn't my fault.

32:29.649 --> 32:31.584
Someone tipped me off.

32:31.651 --> 32:32.818
Excuses, excuses.

32:32.886 --> 32:35.120
"It wasn't me, it was
the biker that did it."

32:35.188 --> 32:37.089
I thought he was bringing
me a sculpture.

32:37.157 --> 32:38.591
Were you disappointed?

32:38.658 --> 32:39.818
I didn't know what they were.

32:39.859 --> 32:42.194
I never would have done
it if I had any idea

32:42.262 --> 32:43.929
what I was actually dealing with.

32:43.997 --> 32:46.432
Please, please.

32:46.499 --> 32:49.902
You can't take them away.

32:51.338 --> 32:53.205
I can't live without them.

32:53.273 --> 32:55.674
Perhaps you don't understand.

32:57.143 --> 32:59.812
(growling) They're mine.

32:59.879 --> 33:03.282
Now, before I deal with you,

33:03.350 --> 33:07.486
I have just one
burning question on my mind.

33:09.556 --> 33:11.457
Who tipped you off?

33:26.473 --> 33:27.940
(chuckles dryly)

33:28.008 --> 33:29.675
I knew you'd come.

33:29.743 --> 33:31.176
Of course I'd come.

33:33.546 --> 33:36.415
It's my duty to return the
wings where they belong.

33:36.483 --> 33:38.417
Is that all?

33:38.485 --> 33:40.628
(chuckles)

33:42.989 --> 33:45.724
After everything that
you've been through...

33:45.792 --> 33:48.460
bleeding, searching,
reaching to the high heavens for help...

33:48.528 --> 33:50.896
now that you finally have your wings,

33:50.964 --> 33:53.932
doesn't part of you
long to assume your form?

33:55.835 --> 33:57.836
Get back to where you belong?

33:57.904 --> 33:59.571
(sighs)

34:03.977 --> 34:06.111
Not exactly.

34:10.183 --> 34:12.384
What are you doing?!

34:12.452 --> 34:14.453
Well, ruining your plan, it seems.

34:15.922 --> 34:17.389
It was you, brother.

34:17.456 --> 34:20.826
You tipped Carmen off, and
you orchestrated the theft.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.594
Because you left me no choice.

34:22.661 --> 34:23.862
(laughs)

34:23.929 --> 34:26.130
Well, clearly you were desperate.

34:26.199 --> 34:28.199
I mean, you were
willing to let a human die

34:28.268 --> 34:30.668
and unleash the wings upon the world

34:30.737 --> 34:32.638
just to remind me who I was.

34:32.706 --> 34:35.373
(laughs) To fool me

34:35.442 --> 34:37.176
into desiring the wings

34:37.243 --> 34:38.911
and the hellish throne they accompany.

34:38.978 --> 34:41.380
Well, do you know what?

34:42.482 --> 34:44.783
It almost bloody worked.

34:44.851 --> 34:46.452
But destroy them?

34:48.321 --> 34:49.388
Why?

34:49.456 --> 34:51.456
Well, you were right.

34:51.524 --> 34:54.059
Severing the wings was a half measure.

34:54.127 --> 34:56.428
I did leave myself an out.

34:56.496 --> 35:00.365
A rip cord back to the life that
dear old Dad chose for me.

35:00.433 --> 35:02.167
But I don't need it now,

35:02.235 --> 35:07.005
because, in case I haven't made
myself abundantly clear,

35:07.073 --> 35:10.776
I'm never going back to Hell.

35:19.152 --> 35:20.552
But, uh...

35:20.620 --> 35:22.354
A for effort.

35:22.422 --> 35:26.825
I'm sure Dad will give you
a big gold star for trying.

35:26.893 --> 35:28.694
(bellowing)

35:34.434 --> 35:36.702
(laughing) That's
right, hit me, brother.

35:36.770 --> 35:37.970
Go on, again.

35:38.038 --> 35:39.104
Become like me.

35:39.172 --> 35:40.172
Become wrath.

35:40.173 --> 35:41.740
Fall as I did!

35:41.808 --> 35:43.475
(laughs)

35:43.543 --> 35:44.677
Come on.

35:48.014 --> 35:50.215
Come on.

35:50.283 --> 35:51.383
(chuckles)

35:53.887 --> 35:57.256
You never were much of
a closer, were you, eh?

35:57.324 --> 36:01.026
Can't stand to get your hands dirty.

36:01.094 --> 36:02.094
(chuckles)

36:02.095 --> 36:04.396
This is far from over.

36:11.137 --> 36:14.473
I'll do whatever it
takes to get you back to Hell.

36:29.255 --> 36:31.623
He was like a brother to me.

36:31.691 --> 36:33.325
And for the last eight years,

36:33.393 --> 36:35.995
he was the best damn partner

36:36.062 --> 36:38.364
that I could've asked for.

36:40.500 --> 36:41.767
(sighs)

36:45.572 --> 36:48.407
You know, I-I remember
one time that he...

36:49.943 --> 36:52.644
What in the hell...?

36:53.980 --> 36:57.850
What part of "not
welcome" does she not understand?

36:57.917 --> 36:59.918
Easy, Anthony. Easy.

36:59.986 --> 37:01.720
You got some nerve, Decker.

37:01.788 --> 37:03.889
(sighs)

37:03.957 --> 37:06.525
I'd like to say a few
things about Malcolm.

37:09.062 --> 37:11.263
He was a hero,

37:11.331 --> 37:14.533
who got shot doing what
all of us do every day,

37:14.601 --> 37:17.469
by putting himself in the line of fire.

37:18.438 --> 37:19.338
I can't take back

37:19.406 --> 37:21.673
the things I've said.

37:21.741 --> 37:24.410
But I can promise

37:24.477 --> 37:26.412
not to let his life...

37:26.479 --> 37:28.747
or death... go in vain.

37:30.750 --> 37:34.887
And for any pain that I've caused...

37:34.954 --> 37:38.891
his family or otherwise...

37:38.958 --> 37:40.492
I'm sorry.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.729
I'm closing the case against him.

37:46.766 --> 37:48.434
To a good cop.

37:51.638 --> 37:53.338
To Malcolm.

37:55.875 --> 37:57.810
To Malcolm.

37:57.877 --> 37:59.711
ALL: To Malcolm.

38:13.059 --> 38:14.526
I hope you're right about this.

38:14.594 --> 38:16.528
Trust me, if we're gonna
find a dirty cop,

38:16.596 --> 38:18.464
it's best they
don't think we're looking.

38:18.531 --> 38:21.867
(piano plays Johnny
Cash's version of "Hurt")

38:33.546 --> 38:37.216
I cleaned up your mess on the beach.

38:37.283 --> 38:39.751
I'm here to stay, Maze.

38:39.819 --> 38:41.286
(sighs)

38:41.354 --> 38:43.555
And I truly hate to disappoint you,

38:43.623 --> 38:47.626
but... well, this is
where I have to be now.

38:47.694 --> 38:52.498
And I know, even with
all the sex and drugs...

38:52.565 --> 38:54.500
and more sex,

38:54.567 --> 38:57.669
this isn't what you bargained for.

38:57.737 --> 39:01.140
And I know you made a vow, but...

39:01.207 --> 39:03.408
But nothing.

39:04.978 --> 39:06.478
I am with you, Lucifer,

39:06.546 --> 39:08.747
from now until the end.

39:10.350 --> 39:13.418
We're a team, right?

39:15.889 --> 39:17.823
Of course.

39:25.198 --> 39:27.699
Now... (sighs)

39:27.767 --> 39:29.134
you should get some ice.

39:29.202 --> 39:31.336
Yeah.

(laughing): Sorry. This, yes.

39:53.326 --> 39:55.794
Just a little, you
know, squabble with my bro.

39:55.862 --> 39:57.696
Nothing serious.

39:57.764 --> 39:59.898
(sighs)

39:59.966 --> 40:01.700
I don't...

40:01.768 --> 40:05.103
I don't like how we left
it at the auction.

40:05.171 --> 40:07.973
Yes. Yes, I...

40:08.041 --> 40:09.942
I agree.

40:10.009 --> 40:12.778
You definitely could

40:23.590 --> 40:28.126
Look, I know how
much it sucks being alone.

40:28.194 --> 40:30.596
And I can't pretend to understand

40:30.663 --> 40:32.998
why the wings meant so much to you.

40:33.066 --> 40:35.300
(sighs)

40:35.368 --> 40:37.369
But if we're really friends, it...

40:37.437 --> 40:40.706
it should be enough
just knowing that they did.

40:44.177 --> 40:45.577
The wings are old news now.

40:45.645 --> 40:47.579
(chuckles, clears his throat)

40:47.647 --> 40:49.615
Earlier they were all
you could think about.

40:49.682 --> 40:52.150
Now you just don't care?

40:52.218 --> 40:54.219
Well, in my search for the wings,

40:54.287 --> 40:56.321
I realized what they actually were.

40:56.389 --> 40:58.824
A relic worth exactly

40:58.891 --> 41:01.727
what someone was
willing to pay for them.

41:01.794 --> 41:04.229
What can I say?

41:04.297 --> 41:07.466
I've moved on to
bigger and better things.

41:07.533 --> 41:09.167
So, what changed?

41:09.235 --> 41:10.936
I don't know.

41:11.004 --> 41:13.805
Huh.

41:13.873 --> 41:15.507
Or won't say.

41:15.575 --> 41:16.875
(laughs)

41:16.943 --> 41:19.378
Well, how'd your
Palmetto thing go anyway?

41:19.445 --> 41:22.080
Hmm? Did you find the
answer you were looking for?

41:22.148 --> 41:23.749
(sighs)

41:23.816 --> 41:25.083
I found something.

41:25.151 --> 41:27.986
Oh. Well.

41:28.054 --> 41:31.123
To our equally enigmatic futures.
