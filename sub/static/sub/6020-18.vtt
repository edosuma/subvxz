00:03.500 --> 00:06.333
You know that manslaughter
is the least serious murder charge?

00:06.780 --> 00:08.896
- You don't say.
- Manslaughter.

00:09.060 --> 00:10.778
Literally, the slaughter of a man.

00:10.940 --> 00:12.578
- Sounds brutal, doesn't it?
- Heinous.

00:12.740 --> 00:16.096
Yet it's the most socially acceptable
form of murder.

00:16.420 --> 00:18.411
So you think we should
change the name.

00:18.580 --> 00:22.892
Yes, I do. How about
"inadvertent life-ending"?

00:23.740 --> 00:25.139
"Unintentional snuff-out."

00:25.300 --> 00:27.860
How about
"I can't believe it's not murder"?

00:32.420 --> 00:36.299
Oh, boy, I was up till 4 in the morning
watching that Omen trilogy.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.889
- That's good stuff.
- The devil? Forget about it.

00:39.060 --> 00:40.698
Well, he was the devil's son, right?

00:40.860 --> 00:44.694
- I thought he was the devil's helper.
- He's pretty scary for a helper.

00:45.980 --> 00:48.494
I can't keep doing this to myself.
I'm exhausted.

00:48.660 --> 00:50.298
Can't you grab a nap at work?

00:50.460 --> 00:53.133
Not with that big glass window
looking out onto the hall.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.733
And I love a good nap.

00:54.900 --> 00:57.334
Sometimes it's the only thing
getting me out of bed.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.138
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

00:59.300 --> 01:02.258
- What are you doing now?
- Gonna take a stroll through the park.

01:02.420 --> 01:03.773
With a gentleman caller?

01:03.940 --> 01:06.170
Yes, his name is Hal.

01:06.340 --> 01:09.013
Walking date's good.
You don't have to look at the person.

01:09.180 --> 01:11.136
It's the next best thing
to being alone.

01:12.300 --> 01:13.449
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.

01:13.620 --> 01:15.770
- Shower?
- Oh, pool.

01:16.140 --> 01:17.732
I just swam 200 laps.

01:17.900 --> 01:19.333
You are kidding.

01:19.700 --> 01:23.010
Yeah, look at those babies, huh?
They're prunes.

01:23.180 --> 01:25.091
You know, I saw Conrad
going to your place.

01:25.260 --> 01:28.332
Yeah, that's right. Those new
kitchen cabinets. How's that coming?

01:28.500 --> 01:30.889
Slow. I gotta hold this guy's hand
on every decision.

01:31.060 --> 01:33.051
Kramer, listen.
You've seen The Omen, right?

01:33.220 --> 01:35.336
What exactly was that kid?

01:35.500 --> 01:36.979
Oh, Damien?

01:37.140 --> 01:41.372
Nothing, just a mischievous,
rambunctious kid.

01:43.700 --> 01:47.329
George, have you seen
that American League directory?

01:47.500 --> 01:49.536
It's a big green book.

01:50.740 --> 01:53.812
- Right here.
- Thanks, kiddo.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074

02:07.660 --> 02:09.616
You know Twinkies aren't cooked?

02:09.780 --> 02:11.691
It looks cooked.
It's dark on the bottom.

02:11.860 --> 02:13.930
That's just the way it is.
It's a substance.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.977
Well, I don't care. They're delicious.

02:16.140 --> 02:18.779
- You wanna sit down?
- Oh, I don't sit on park benches.

02:18.940 --> 02:20.896
- They're very bad for the back.
- Really?

02:21.060 --> 02:23.972
I threw my back out 15 years ago.
Ever since, I've been careful.

02:24.140 --> 02:25.937
I buy my furniture
at an ergonomic store.

02:26.100 --> 02:29.297
Oh, those places
have the stupidest names.

02:29.460 --> 02:31.530
Like... Like Back in Business...

02:31.700 --> 02:34.168
...or Good Vertebrations.

02:34.340 --> 02:36.934
Not this one.
It's called the Lumbar Yard.

02:41.780 --> 02:44.374
Hey, Jerry.
Jerry, are you okay with this hinge?

02:44.540 --> 02:46.337
- Yeah.
- I can get you any kind you want.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.650
Four holes, two holes,
bronze, no hinge at all.

02:48.820 --> 02:51.414
You know, why don't we just go
with the one in your hand?

02:51.940 --> 02:53.931
- Well, these are different.
- Drop one.

02:54.820 --> 02:56.731
Left.

02:59.820 --> 03:02.971
Jerry, look at my eyes.

03:03.140 --> 03:05.335
A little less beady today.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.377
Because I'm refreshed.

03:07.540 --> 03:10.293
I finally found a way
to sleep in my office.

03:10.460 --> 03:11.893
Under the desk, huh?

03:12.060 --> 03:14.699
I lie on my back, I tuck in the chair,
I'm invisible.

03:14.860 --> 03:16.134
Sounds like a cool fort.

03:16.900 --> 03:19.334
Hey, Jerry, do you want
a flat edge on this molding...

03:19.500 --> 03:21.013
...or do you want me to bevel it?

03:21.180 --> 03:24.297
- I'll tell you what I'd like to do with it.
- Hey, Conrad, is it?

03:24.460 --> 03:26.894
Conrad, Connie or Con.
Whatever you prefer.

03:27.420 --> 03:28.614
Let me ask you a question.

03:28.780 --> 03:31.658
Could you expand
the space underneath a desk...

03:31.820 --> 03:33.811
...you know, give it
a little more headroom?

03:33.980 --> 03:35.857
George, he's kind of tied up here.

03:36.020 --> 03:37.738
What? It would have to be
a night job.

03:37.900 --> 03:40.289
- You normally work after dinner?
- There is no normal.

03:40.460 --> 03:43.770
Whatever Jerry wants. He wants me
here late, I'm late. Early, I'm early.

03:43.940 --> 03:46.818
Why don't you just work
on George's project for a while.

03:46.980 --> 03:48.493
Whatever you want.

03:50.220 --> 03:52.176
So how was Wednesday
in the park with Hal?

03:52.820 --> 03:55.857
It was okay. He's coming over later
to watch a movie.

03:56.020 --> 03:58.409
Hey, listen,
what's better for your back:

03:58.580 --> 04:01.890
The couch cushions
or a folding chair?

04:02.060 --> 04:03.652
I don't know.

04:04.660 --> 04:07.538
Maybe we'll just stand
and watch the TV.

04:09.220 --> 04:10.812
I gotta go. Somebody's at my door.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.009
- Yeah?
- Delivery.

04:17.019 --> 04:18.293
- Elaine Benes?
- Yeah.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.370
We're from Lumbar Yard.
Got your mattress.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.528
Mattress?
I didn't order a mattress.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.452
Who sent this?

04:27.300 --> 04:29.655
"Hal Kitzmiller"?

04:32.260 --> 04:37.539
You think it might be possible to add
a little shelf, like, for an alarm clock?

04:37.700 --> 04:39.213
What, about maybe that big?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.052
- I don't know, like this?
- Like that?

04:41.220 --> 04:42.414
- Like that.
- I can do that.

04:42.580 --> 04:43.933
Great.

04:44.820 --> 04:47.334
You know, this could sound crazy...

04:47.540 --> 04:51.089
...but what do you think about adding
a drawer for, like, a blanket?

04:51.380 --> 04:53.132
- Blanket or a quilt?
- Blanket.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.892
- About that thick?
- Maybe like this.

04:55.060 --> 04:56.095
- Like that?
- Like that.

04:56.260 --> 04:58.615
- lf that's what you want.
- That's what I want.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.611
Hey, George, do you want
this cup holder...?

05:01.780 --> 05:04.089
Want it mounted on the left,
the right, the middle?

05:04.260 --> 05:05.932
Whatever.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.458
This is unbelievable.

05:15.620 --> 05:17.417
This is better than my bed at home.

05:17.580 --> 05:19.491
All right. It's been a long night.

05:19.660 --> 05:21.093
You go home and get some sleep.

05:21.260 --> 05:23.774
- lf that's what you want.
- That's what I want.

05:28.980 --> 05:32.052
- Morning, George.
- Morning, Mr. Wilhelm.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.730
- I got pool problems, Jerry.
- What happened?

05:42.900 --> 05:44.891
Well, I had been swimming
for three hours...

05:45.060 --> 05:48.336
...and I was in a real groove,
so I decided to keep going.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.616
But at 10, they start the aquacise.

05:50.780 --> 05:53.613
Thirty-five geriatrics
throwing elbows.

05:53.780 --> 05:58.012
It was like I was swimming through
a flabby-armed spanking machine.

05:58.180 --> 06:01.616
- Well, how long did that last?
- Half-hour. Then diving class started.

06:01.780 --> 06:03.930
Well, that got a little messy.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.051
I gotta find a new place to swim...

06:07.220 --> 06:09.211
...because that pool
can't hold me, Jerry.

06:09.940 --> 06:12.010
- How was the movie?
- I cancelled.

06:12.180 --> 06:15.297
Hal sent a mattress
to my apartment.

06:15.460 --> 06:17.576
- The nerve of that guy.
- Why?

06:17.740 --> 06:19.458
He's got a back problem.

06:19.620 --> 06:22.180
You think he was expecting
a roll in the supportive hay?

06:22.660 --> 06:24.252
After one date.

06:24.420 --> 06:27.253
- What's that guy's last name again?
- Kitzmiller.

06:27.580 --> 06:29.252
Oh, that's right.

06:30.460 --> 06:32.178
What are you gonna do
with the mattress?

06:32.340 --> 06:33.534
I don't know, chuck it?

06:33.700 --> 06:35.292
Oh, wait, no, no, no. I'll take it.

06:35.460 --> 06:37.655
Yeah, come over.
See if it'll fit in my bedroom.

06:37.820 --> 06:40.095
- Oh, all right.
- Yeah, my old one sprung a leak.

06:40.260 --> 06:41.932
- You have a waterbed?
- Sand.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.692
It's like sleeping on a beach.

06:44.980 --> 06:46.174
- Hey.
- Hi, Con.

06:46.340 --> 06:47.819
Jerry, I'm sorry I'm late.

06:47.980 --> 06:50.096
George and I,
we've been up all night long.

06:50.260 --> 06:52.490
I can make up the time to you
any number of ways.

06:52.660 --> 06:55.618
How about this?
Finish this thing up today.

06:55.780 --> 06:58.772
- Couple questions for you.
- No, no more questions.

06:58.940 --> 07:01.898
Just figure it out for yourself
and get it done.

07:02.060 --> 07:05.689
All right, Jerry, but I can figure it out
by myself any way you want.

07:05.860 --> 07:08.977
Just do it.

07:12.460 --> 07:15.258
Costanza. Where's Costanza?

07:16.500 --> 07:17.569
Have you seen Costanza?

07:17.740 --> 07:18.934
I've seen him around.

07:19.100 --> 07:22.490
He was humming this song yesterday.
I can't seem to get it out of my head.

07:22.660 --> 07:24.093
I gotta know the name of that.

07:24.260 --> 07:26.774
She's a heartbreak er
A love-tak er

07:26.940 --> 07:29.579
Brubak er run this prison lik e a man

07:29.740 --> 07:32.174
Something like that.
Very catchy tune. Very, very catchy.

07:32.340 --> 07:35.013
Well, you know what? I'm gonna
sit here and wait for that guy.

07:35.180 --> 07:36.852
What is this, People?

07:37.420 --> 07:39.775
"The Most Beautiful People"
People.

07:39.940 --> 07:43.171
Connie Sellecca.
Nothing wrong that, huh?

07:47.380 --> 07:49.291
Elaine, you're taking this
the wrong way.

07:49.460 --> 07:50.654
That's not what I intended.

07:50.820 --> 07:52.970
Well, what did you intend, Hal?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.813
I just wanted you to have the comfort
and support you deserve.

07:55.980 --> 07:58.494
That's why I had the mattress
custom designed for you.

07:58.660 --> 08:00.093
Custom designed?

08:00.260 --> 08:03.411
They adjust the foam density and
the spring tension to your body type.

08:03.580 --> 08:06.299
I estimated your height and weight:
5'8", about 110 pounds?

08:08.500 --> 08:12.891
Oh, that is the nicest thing
anyone has ever done for me.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.620
- So you do like the mattress?
- I love it.

08:15.780 --> 08:19.819
I'm glad I kept it.

08:22.140 --> 08:23.971
Over there, that's Brooklyn.

08:24.140 --> 08:25.493
That's where Spike Lee lives.

08:28.180 --> 08:31.570
Hey, there's a man
swimming in the water.

08:34.340 --> 08:36.900
No, that's probably
just a dead body, son.

08:37.059 --> 08:40.097
You see, when the mob kills someone,
they throw the body in the river.

08:44.220 --> 08:45.448
Hey, Jerr.

08:46.060 --> 08:47.254
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

08:47.420 --> 08:49.331
Well, my swimming pool
problems are solved.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.173
I just found myself
miles and miles of open lanes.

08:52.340 --> 08:55.298
- What is that smell?
- That's East River.

08:56.180 --> 08:58.011
- You're swimming in the East River?
- Yeah.

08:58.180 --> 08:59.454
The most heavily-trafficked...

08:59.620 --> 09:02.134
...overly-contaminated waterway
on the Eastern Seaboard?

09:02.300 --> 09:05.019
Technically, Norfolk
has more gross tonnage.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.777
How could you swim in that water?

09:07.940 --> 09:09.771
I saw a couple of other guys
out there.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.737
- Swimming?
- Well, floating.

09:11.900 --> 09:14.778
They weren't moving much,
but they were out there.

09:35.660 --> 09:36.888
Hey, Kramer. It's Elaine.

09:37.060 --> 09:38.698
Thanks for bringing
my mattress back...

09:38.860 --> 09:41.977
...and I guess I'll just get
my spare key from you whenever.

09:42.140 --> 09:43.937
All right. Bye.

09:47.460 --> 09:49.690
Oh, this is a good mattress.

09:57.660 --> 10:00.493
Where is this guy? I've been waiting
for three and a half hours.

10:00.660 --> 10:03.220
Should I go? No way, Jack.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.736
I'm not humming it
at the record store again.

10:05.900 --> 10:08.175
- Mr. Steinbrenner?
- That's what they call me.

10:08.340 --> 10:11.332
- Your grandchildren are here.
- Oh, well, send them in.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.695
- Send the tykes in.
- Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandpa.

10:13.860 --> 10:15.373
Hey, you little kids.

10:15.540 --> 10:17.929
Who are you people?
Come here. Come here.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.568
How about a ride on
the Stein-pony express? Get up here.

10:20.740 --> 10:23.049
What's your name, shorty?
Mel? Are you Mel?

10:26.180 --> 10:28.057
- Hello.
- Jerry, Jerry.

10:28.220 --> 10:30.529
I'm trapped under my desk.
Steinbrenner's in the room.

10:30.700 --> 10:33.055
- You gotta help me.
- Who is this?

10:33.220 --> 10:35.529
- Jerry.
- Hi.

10:35.700 --> 10:38.498
Go away. Bye-bye. Get away.

10:38.660 --> 10:43.097
- Hi, I'm Brian.
- Beat it, Brian. Beat it. Beat it.

10:43.580 --> 10:45.218
Why don't you
just have him paged?

10:45.380 --> 10:47.530
They'll see the extension's
coming from my...

10:47.700 --> 10:50.578
Back off. Come on.

10:52.380 --> 10:53.574
Would you do something?

10:53.740 --> 10:55.059
Call in a bomb threat.

10:55.220 --> 10:57.495
A bomb threat? Why would I
call in a bomb threat?

10:57.660 --> 10:59.378
Just call.

10:59.540 --> 11:03.055
- I think I should have some reason.
- Jerry!

11:05.260 --> 11:08.138
You kids are up on all the new tunes.
Tell me if this rings a bell:

11:08.300 --> 11:10.609
Heartbreak er
Love-tak er

11:10.780 --> 11:13.340
Shoemak er
Won't you fix my shoes for free?

11:13.500 --> 11:15.218
Anything? Shorty? Girl?

11:15.380 --> 11:18.497
Mr. Steinbrenner, we received a call.
There's a bomb in the building.

11:18.660 --> 11:20.173
- Thank God.
- A bomb in the building?

11:20.340 --> 11:23.298
Oh, my God. Quick,
everybody under the desk.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.737
Can you imagine
what went through my mind...

11:28.900 --> 11:31.050
...when I saw there wasn't room
under that desk...

11:31.220 --> 11:32.573
...for me and my babies?

11:33.100 --> 11:34.818
- I'm sorry, sir.
- You know what I think?

11:35.300 --> 11:37.814
- I think you knew about that bomb.
- What?

11:37.980 --> 11:39.572
You had a premonition
about the bomb.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.378
You climbed under
because you have ESP.

11:41.540 --> 11:43.895
Quick, George,
put a thought in my mind.

11:44.740 --> 11:47.618
Meatballs, huh? Unbelievable.
You're a wonder, George.

11:49.380 --> 11:53.453
Anyway, this terrorist
had a very specific demand.

11:53.620 --> 11:55.690
No more cheap adjustable hats
for Hat Day.

11:55.860 --> 11:58.249
He wants fitted hats
just like the players wear.

12:01.580 --> 12:04.048
- Jerry. Jerry.
- Yeah.

12:06.220 --> 12:07.812
What the hell is this?

12:07.980 --> 12:10.175
- Where are you?
- Over here.

12:10.340 --> 12:11.853
You can see right through here.

12:12.980 --> 12:16.131
What is this? It's like you're selling
movie tickets back here.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.052
I think it's kind of cozy.

12:18.740 --> 12:22.415
All right. You are not gonna believe
what Kramer did to my mattress.

12:22.580 --> 12:25.253
I can't... I can't talk to you like this.

12:27.700 --> 12:31.295
So Kramer completely
funked up my mattress.

12:31.660 --> 12:33.252
Does it smell like the East River?

12:33.420 --> 12:36.253
Yes, it does. How did you know?

12:36.420 --> 12:38.980
Kramer's been swimming laps
between the Queensboro Bridge...

12:39.140 --> 12:42.257
...and the Brooklyn Bridge.
- Oh, great!

12:46.020 --> 12:49.217
Oh, man,
I'm on the wrong floor again.

12:50.980 --> 12:52.379
Hey.

12:52.540 --> 12:55.179
Thanks for ruining my mattress.
It reeks.

12:55.340 --> 12:58.173
Hey, you know what I think it is?
I think it's that East River.

12:58.740 --> 13:00.458
I think it might be polluted.

13:03.540 --> 13:07.294
Well, you really did it to me
this time, Seinfeld.

13:11.700 --> 13:13.770
What the hell happened here?

13:13.940 --> 13:15.339
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:15.700 --> 13:18.976
- Look how obtrusive it is.
- It is obtrusive, isn't it?

13:19.140 --> 13:21.574
- It's very obtrusive.
- I don't think it's that bad.

13:21.740 --> 13:24.971
- Well, can I get a stool in here?
- No, the stools go over there.

13:25.140 --> 13:28.098
No, no, no, that's no good.
I'm leaving.

13:28.260 --> 13:31.696
Yeah, I'm with stinky.
I'm going back to my place.

13:36.100 --> 13:40.252
Fitted Hat Day? That's what
you asked Steinbrenner for?

13:40.420 --> 13:43.298
Hey, they're actually
doing the fitted hats? Cool.

13:43.740 --> 13:48.097
Guess who he put in charge
of Fitted Hat Day. Me.

13:48.260 --> 13:50.820
- Hey, look at you.
- Yeah, look at me.

13:50.980 --> 13:55.258
Now, I gotta figure out the different
head sizes of 59,000 different people.

13:55.420 --> 13:57.854
What if a pinhead shows up?
I gotta be on top of that.

13:58.020 --> 14:00.534
No knockoffs. I want the ones
like the real players wear.

14:01.260 --> 14:03.569
Forget the fitted hats!
I'm not doing it!

14:03.740 --> 14:06.937
And you're gonna call Steinbrenner
back and cancel the whole thing!

14:07.100 --> 14:10.410
- Could you at least get a hat for me?
- Fine. What size?

14:10.580 --> 14:12.650
- Seven and five-eighths.
- Seven and five-eighths!

14:12.820 --> 14:15.129
- Why are you shouting?
- I don't know! It's this place.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.655
I'm very uncomfortable here.

14:19.740 --> 14:21.014
So you're liking the mattress?

14:21.180 --> 14:22.693
Oh, I'm loving it.

14:22.860 --> 14:24.612
You know, we should...

14:25.940 --> 14:27.168
...get going.

14:27.940 --> 14:30.738
- What is that smell?
- What smell?

14:32.620 --> 14:35.293
I think it's the mattress.
Did something happen to it?

14:35.460 --> 14:39.851
No, no. Oh, you know what that is?

14:41.220 --> 14:45.816
I went clamming the other day
and I forgot to hose off my boots.

14:45.980 --> 14:49.416
- Clamming?
- Yeah, I clam and scallop.

14:49.580 --> 14:51.093
I clam and scallop.

14:54.820 --> 14:57.050
Yes, yes, come in. Come in.

14:57.220 --> 14:59.575
Sir, I just got a call
from the terrorist.

14:59.740 --> 15:01.696
I told him to call here,
if you have a moment.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.852
Costanza, let me ask you something.
Is it "Fe-bru-ary" or "Feb-uary"?

15:05.020 --> 15:08.330
Because I prefer "uary,"
and what is this rule?

15:09.140 --> 15:11.608
Let me put that
on speaker phone for you, sir.

15:12.180 --> 15:14.853
- Hello, bomber?
- Yeah, this is the terrorist bomber.

15:15.020 --> 15:17.295
You know, Costanza
is busting his hump on those hats.

15:17.460 --> 15:20.338
Yeah, you know, about those hats,
I think maybe I changed my mind.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.331
You don't want them?
They're gone. Goodbye.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.730
- Good thinking, sir.
- Now, what do you want instead?

15:24.900 --> 15:26.572
- What?
- Well, you're the terrorist.

15:26.740 --> 15:28.093
You gotta want something.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.570
It would be nice
if you called tick et-holders...

15:30.740 --> 15:32.253
...if a game is
gonna be rained out.

15:32.420 --> 15:34.456
All right, George,
you can handle that.

15:34.740 --> 15:35.934
What the hell are you doing?

15:36.100 --> 15:38.773
We have to stand tough. That's why
I had to hang up the phone.

15:38.940 --> 15:40.817
When someone's unstable,
don't stir the pot.

15:40.980 --> 15:43.540
Know what I'll do? Run around
the stadium, closing windows.

15:43.700 --> 15:44.974
That's what I'm doing, pal.

15:45.180 --> 15:48.217
And I'll tell you something else:
I am very nervous!

15:49.300 --> 15:52.895
I liked that stuffed-crust pizza,
cheese-in-crust pizza.

15:53.060 --> 15:55.255
- It's just more cheese.
- Let me tell you something.

15:55.420 --> 15:58.537
It'll be years before they find another
place to hide cheese on a pizza.

15:58.700 --> 15:59.815
- Kramer.
- Oh, hey.

15:59.980 --> 16:01.891
Hi. Oh, this is Hal.

16:02.060 --> 16:03.209
Hal, Kramer. Kramer, Hal.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.018
Hal...

16:05.180 --> 16:06.169
...Langerhans.

16:06.540 --> 16:08.496
- Kitzmiller.
- Yeah, Kitzmiller.

16:08.660 --> 16:10.412
- That's right.
- You taking a dip?

16:10.580 --> 16:13.856
- Oh, I'm dipping.
- That smell?

16:14.020 --> 16:15.612
Well, listen I gotta get to the pier.

16:15.780 --> 16:18.089
Ferry traffic gets really bad
around 4:30, but...

16:18.260 --> 16:20.251
Look, I still got your key
to your apartment...

16:20.420 --> 16:22.980
...and I'll give it back to you
as soon as I can.

16:23.380 --> 16:24.779
Baby.

17:01.220 --> 17:02.778
Lunch.

17:05.060 --> 17:07.858
- Kramer.
- Hey.

17:08.420 --> 17:11.457
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- Yeah, sure, sure.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.012
- Oh, boy.
- Kitzmiller.

17:14.579 --> 17:16.377
That's it.

17:16.700 --> 17:21.215
- You and Elaine are pretty close.
- Oh, we go back a ways.

17:21.380 --> 17:23.211
And you've...

17:23.380 --> 17:25.132
How do I put this?

17:25.619 --> 17:28.498
- You've been in her bed.
- That's right.

17:29.380 --> 17:30.654
But this isn't still going on?

17:30.820 --> 17:33.209
No, no, no, she put a stop to that.

17:34.660 --> 17:35.979
That's all I needed to know.

17:36.820 --> 17:39.050
So you actually swim in this thing?

17:39.220 --> 17:42.690
Oh, yeah. Exercises
every muscle in the body.

17:42.860 --> 17:44.293
It's great for the back.

17:44.460 --> 17:46.530
Great for the back. Right.

17:46.700 --> 17:50.329
Four hours in this chop,
and I'm a full inch taller.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.217
Giddyup.

17:57.740 --> 17:59.970
Heartbreak er
Brubak er

18:00.300 --> 18:03.053
Hey, hey, George,
I remember that tune. George?

18:03.260 --> 18:05.012
George?

18:05.180 --> 18:06.738
What's that ticking?

18:12.340 --> 18:14.774
Fire in the hole!

18:16.300 --> 18:19.849
I can't believe the Lumbar Yard
wouldn't pick this up.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.133
Okay.

18:38.820 --> 18:41.459
- You want it back the way it was?
- Yeah, that's right.

18:41.780 --> 18:43.418
You know, I don't get you, Seinfeld.

18:43.580 --> 18:46.140
You want something one day.
The next day you don't like it.

18:46.300 --> 18:48.291
I mean, come on, man.
Make a decision.

18:49.140 --> 18:50.858
One second.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.376
- Hello.
- Jerry, you gotta help me.

18:54.540 --> 18:56.098
I threw my back out.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.488
So just lie down.

18:57.660 --> 19:00.254
I am lying down.

19:00.420 --> 19:04.971
I am trapped
under a funky mattress.

19:05.300 --> 19:07.177
You gotta go get a doctor...

19:07.340 --> 19:11.936
...or at least come over
and roll this thing off of me.

19:12.540 --> 19:14.531
All right. I'll be right there.

19:15.540 --> 19:17.371
Conrad, I gotta go.

19:17.540 --> 19:19.849
Stay, go. Whatever.

19:22.060 --> 19:25.018
- Hey, Kramer.
- What's going on?

19:25.180 --> 19:28.172
I told my chiropractor how swimming
in the river made my back feel.

19:28.340 --> 19:30.058
He recommended it
to all his patients.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.257
Step aside.

19:39.060 --> 19:41.528
He just sunk like a stone, didn't he?

19:46.260 --> 19:49.172
- Sir, I'm sure it's not a bomb.
- Don't be so brave, George.

19:49.340 --> 19:51.251
You mess with them.
They're messing with you.

19:51.420 --> 19:53.217
All right, boys, send it in.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.572
Wait. What's that thing
straight ahead?

19:58.740 --> 20:00.810
Is that's anything? Is that Mothra?

20:02.220 --> 20:04.609
Let's check the desk.
That's where I heard the ticking.

20:04.780 --> 20:07.169
Search each of those drawers,
starting with the top one.

20:14.460 --> 20:18.738
It's just empty calories
and male curiosity, eh, Georgie?

20:18.900 --> 20:20.970
Looks like there's more
compartments underneath.

20:21.140 --> 20:23.096
Compartments underneath?
Probably where it is.

20:23.260 --> 20:25.171
Okay, boys, let it rip.

20:29.980 --> 20:32.255
I'll tell you what,
starting tomorrow, no more desks.

20:32.420 --> 20:34.695
Just a Lucite table and four legs.

20:38.660 --> 20:42.369
Hey! Hey, watch
where you're kicking!

20:43.300 --> 20:45.256
You people find your own river!

20:45.420 --> 20:47.217
- Jeez!
- I'm so sor...

20:47.380 --> 20:49.132
- Kramer.
- Elaine.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.860
Hi. I am loving this.

20:52.020 --> 20:53.772
Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.

20:53.940 --> 20:55.771
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:06.940 --> 21:08.896
Hey, Connie. Jerry around?

21:09.100 --> 21:11.250
No, and I prefer Conrad.

21:12.740 --> 21:14.332
So I heard what happened
to the desk.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.537
There was something so reassuring
about that cozy little space.

21:17.700 --> 21:20.931
Yeah, well, whatever. See you.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.179
Back to normal.

21:25.340 --> 21:27.808
Not bad for 4000 bucks.

21:39.540 --> 21:42.691
Can't believe I got the low-fat.
