WEBVTT

00:04.935 --> 00:07.110
Sideshow Bob Roberts

00:13.986 --> 00:16.620
No sports, no rock
No information

00:16.238 --> 00:19.250
For mindless chatter
We're your station

00:19.241 --> 00:22.760
KBBL talk radio. Now Springfield's
favorite conservative...

00:22.244 --> 00:25.198
...author of well-selling book
Only Turkeys Have Left Wings...

00:25.372 --> 00:28.373
...ladies and gentlemen, Birch Barlow.

00:30.544 --> 00:32.916
That Barlow's a right-wing crackpot.

00:33.880 --> 00:36.338
He said Ted Kennedy lacked integrity.
Can you believe that?

00:36.508 --> 00:39.712
Yeah, switch the station.
I consider myself politically correct.

00:39.887 --> 00:41.879
His views make me uncomfortable.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.973
No, no, no, guys.
Now, I'm not very political.

00:45.142 --> 00:48.178
I usually think people who vote
are a bit fruity.

00:48.354 --> 00:52.482
But for some reason,
this Birch Barlow really speaks to me.

00:58.300 --> 00:59.489
Good morning, freedom-likers.

00:59.657 --> 01:02.693
Birch Barlow, the fourth branch
of government, the 51st state.

01:02.868 --> 01:06.403
You know, there are three things
we'll never get rid of in Springfield:

01:06.580 --> 01:08.489
One, the bats in the public library.

01:10.125 --> 01:12.581
Two, Mrs. McFearley's compost heap.

01:16.548 --> 01:19.502
And three, our six-term mayor...

01:19.677 --> 01:23.342
...the illiterate, tax-cheating,
pot-smoking spend-o-crat...

01:23.514 --> 01:25.720
...Diamond Joe Quimby.

01:25.891 --> 01:27.800
Hey, I am no longer illiterate.

01:28.180 --> 01:31.268
Now, why are we doomed to
this Quimby quagmire, you ask...

01:31.438 --> 01:33.146
...O reasonable listener?

01:33.315 --> 01:35.474
Because this town
is under the stranglehold...

01:35.651 --> 01:38.189
...of a few tie-dyed "tree-huggers"...

01:38.362 --> 01:40.568
...who'd rather play Hacky Sack
than lock up the homeless.

01:41.782 --> 01:44.451
This sounds awfully controversial.

01:44.618 --> 01:47.821
Lisa, you know I don't like
controversy in this house.

01:47.997 --> 01:49.242
I don't like him either...

01:49.415 --> 01:52.581
...but I'm doing a report on local politics
for my school project.

01:52.751 --> 01:56.369
You think you're so big because
your class always gets to do projects.

01:56.547 --> 02:02.419
Well, I'm doing a school project
on fireworks.

02:03.262 --> 02:05.634
Bart, I wish you wouldn't lie like that.

02:07.599 --> 02:10.470
Now, as a special sendoff
and a way to say...

02:12.146 --> 02:14.269
...to our visiting Chinese principals...

02:14.440 --> 02:17.394
...Bart Simpson has promised us
a fireworks display.

02:18.444 --> 02:20.567
- Cool.
- Cool.

02:23.365 --> 02:25.821
What a week.
He promise a big firework display.

02:25.993 --> 02:29.326
- Bad student.
- Bad principal.

02:31.332 --> 02:34.167
So, my friends, let's just junk
those dumb-o-crats...

02:34.335 --> 02:36.872
...and their bleeding-heart
smell-fare program.

02:37.460 --> 02:40.580
I had to listen to this jerk all morning.
Can we listen to something else?

02:40.758 --> 02:44.174
When I'm driving the car,
I get to choose the radio station.

02:44.345 --> 02:48.556
When you're driving,
we'll listen to your radio station.

02:53.687 --> 02:55.929
I can't take this anymore.
Let's switch back.

02:56.106 --> 02:59.310
Let's go to the phones.
First up is Bob from South Springfield.

02:59.485 --> 03:01.442
- Welcome to you, sir.
- Hello, Birch.

03:01.612 --> 03:03.569
Long-time listener, first-time caller.

03:03.739 --> 03:08.317
Kudos for bringing the "public"
back to the Republican Party.

03:08.494 --> 03:12.194
It's time people realized we conservatives
aren't all Johnny Hatemongers...

03:12.373 --> 03:15.955
...and Charlie Bible-Thumps or even,
God forbid, George Bushes.

03:16.585 --> 03:18.578
That sounds like Sideshow Bob.

03:18.754 --> 03:23.831
Yes, ma'am. Sideshow Bob,
yakking it up on the old yak box.

03:24.900 --> 03:28.137
I'll spare you the embarrassment of
admitting you don't know who Bob is.

03:29.431 --> 03:31.922
Sideshow Bob used to be
Krusty the Clown's sidekick.

03:32.101 --> 03:36.763
But in 1990, he framed Krusty for armed
robbery, and Bart got him put in jail.

03:36.939 --> 03:40.106
When he got out, he married Aunt Selma
and tried to murder her.

03:40.317 --> 03:42.855
Oh, Sideshow Bob.

03:43.280 --> 03:45.566
Bart, your mortal enemy is
on the radio.

03:45.739 --> 03:50.734
It's time for more dementia
with Dr. Demento.

03:52.204 --> 03:54.529
And now the Funny 5...

03:55.165 --> 03:59.708
I meant your other mortal enemy.
Sideshow Bob.

04:00.129 --> 04:02.335
Sideshow Bob?

04:02.881 --> 04:05.633
I'm only 10, and I already got
two mortal enemies.

04:06.510 --> 04:10.930
And this proposed expressway
will bring increased commerce...

04:10.264 --> 04:11.841
...to our local merchants.

04:13.559 --> 04:14.887
What's in it for us?

04:15.600 --> 04:18.262
Give us something we like,
or we'll ride you out of town on a rail.

04:18.647 --> 04:20.935
Well, what do you people like?

04:21.149 --> 04:23.226
- Sleep.
- Sexy dames, and plenty of them.

04:23.402 --> 04:26.735
Matlock!

04:27.865 --> 04:33.535
Well, I suppose I could name it
the Matlock Expressway.

04:36.665 --> 04:40.710
But it would be terribly myopic of me
to blame all my current woes...

04:40.878 --> 04:44.543
...on one spiky-haired little simpleton.

04:44.757 --> 04:47.508
Myopic or, to say the least,
intransigent.

04:47.676 --> 04:49.965
Now, you mentioned
some woes there.

04:50.137 --> 04:54.400
Well, you see, Birch,
I'm presently incarcerated.

04:56.810 --> 05:00.600
Convicted of a crime
I didn't even commit.

05:00.689 --> 05:03.524
Attempted murder.
Now, honestly, what is that?

05:03.692 --> 05:07.260
Do they give a Nobel Prize
for attempted chemistry? Do they?

05:07.863 --> 05:10.354
Oh, really.
Now, this is a personal call.

05:10.532 --> 05:13.450
Now, my friends,
isn't this just typical?

05:13.619 --> 05:18.447
Another intelligent conservative here
railroaded by our liberal justice system.

05:18.624 --> 05:23.333
Just like Colonel Oliver North,
Officer Stacey Koon...

05:23.504 --> 05:25.662
...and cartoon smokesperson
Joe Camel.

05:27.910 --> 05:28.419
Well, I've had it.

05:28.592 --> 05:33.337
I am gonna make it my mission
to see that our friend Bob is set free.

05:33.514 --> 05:35.257
No!

05:36.725 --> 05:40.590
Well, despite Bart's objections,
the people of South Africa...

05:40.229 --> 05:42.471
...can now vote in free
democratic elections.

05:42.648 --> 05:46.990
My friends, Bob is a political prisoner.

05:46.276 --> 05:49.728
I want every loyal listener
to do everything they can...

05:49.905 --> 05:51.779
...to get him out of jail.

05:51.949 --> 05:53.360
All right, you heard the man.

05:54.340 --> 05:55.991
One grenade each.

05:56.578 --> 06:01.573
Moe, I think he meant through
nonviolent, grassroots political action.

06:01.750 --> 06:04.241
Oh, Jeez. Really? You think so?

06:04.420 --> 06:07.623
All right, give them back. Come on.
Everybody, give them back.

06:07.798 --> 06:10.336
Hey. Hey!
Who pulled the pin on this one?

06:13.679 --> 06:16.348
Very well, if that is the way
the winds are blowing...

06:16.515 --> 06:19.600
...let no one say I don't also blow.

06:19.184 --> 06:20.513
Free Bob!

06:20.686 --> 06:23.936
By special order of
the mayor of Springfield...

06:24.106 --> 06:27.142
...you are hereby granted
a full and complete pardon.

06:27.318 --> 06:31.362
Congratulations,
Robert Underdunk Terwilliger.

06:36.660 --> 06:39.661
- Boat's on the other side.
- Yes, thank you.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:01.727 --> 07:03.102
Hail, brothers.

07:07.816 --> 07:11.481
Now, then, gentlemen,
the mayoral campaign is upon us.

07:11.654 --> 07:13.314
If we hope to defeat Joe Quimby...

07:13.489 --> 07:16.692
...we need a candidate with
name recognition and media savvy.

07:16.867 --> 07:19.987
A true leader
who will do exactly as he's told.

07:20.162 --> 07:21.787
Monty, I'm way ahead of you.

07:21.955 --> 07:26.333
If you'll just open that door,
you'll see the next mayor of Springfield.

07:29.713 --> 07:31.920
Nice. Very nice.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.674
- What did it say?
- No, no. Bob. Bob, come in.

07:38.305 --> 07:40.974
A fine mahoq to you all.

07:41.141 --> 07:42.600
Why, he's even better.

07:42.768 --> 07:45.804
I agree. I like the human touch.

07:49.149 --> 07:52.399
I want you on your best behavior
for this choreographed media event.

07:52.569 --> 07:54.313
There is to be no wising off...

07:54.488 --> 07:57.857
...no face-making and no grass-eating.
This means you, Ralph.

07:58.330 --> 08:00.156
- Yes, sir.
- Hello, children.

08:00.327 --> 08:01.406
Hello, Bart.

08:02.579 --> 08:07.400
Friends, my opponent, Joe Quimby,
is confused about your school system.

08:07.209 --> 08:09.878
Do you know what he does?
He flip-flops.

08:14.133 --> 08:18.261
Sometimes he doesn't know
whether he's coming or going.

08:21.974 --> 08:25.580
He wants to sell your future short.

08:31.250 --> 08:33.183
Bart, we can't let Bob
steal the spotlight.

08:33.360 --> 08:36.650
We'll have to stoop
to the lowest common denominator.

08:36.238 --> 08:37.317
I can do that.

08:38.823 --> 08:42.193
Help! I'm being attacked by things.

08:44.203 --> 08:46.363
Uncle Mayor was just saying
that us kids...

08:46.540 --> 08:49.458
...are the most important
natural resource we have.

08:49.627 --> 08:50.955
More important than coal?

08:52.870 --> 08:53.879
Yes.

08:57.468 --> 09:00.634
Oh, that was a big mistake, Bart.

09:00.888 --> 09:03.639
No children have ever meddled
with the Republican Party...

09:03.807 --> 09:05.302
...and lived to tell about it.

09:16.820 --> 09:18.398
Stay out of Riverdale.

09:21.158 --> 09:23.447
Without Mayor Quimby
Our town would really stink

09:23.619 --> 09:27.202
We wouldn't have a tire yard
Or a mid-sized roller rink

09:27.373 --> 09:30.907
We wouldn't have our gallows
Or a shiny Bigfoot trap

09:31.850 --> 09:34.418
It's not the mayor's fault
That the stadium collapsed

09:34.588 --> 09:37.589
Quimby. If you were running
for mayor, he'd vote for you.

09:37.758 --> 09:39.715
Paid for by
the Mayor Quimby Committee.

09:39.885 --> 09:43.669
Hey, four-eyes, vote Quimby.
Hey, beard-o, vote Quimby.

09:43.847 --> 09:46.303
This time, he's the lesser of two evils.

09:46.475 --> 09:48.764
Yeah, yeah, I love Grimby.

09:49.395 --> 09:52.598
Could I have some more
bumper stickers, please, dude?

09:57.152 --> 09:58.647
All right.

09:58.862 --> 10:02.812
The mummy's ready
for his mystical journey.

10:04.201 --> 10:06.906
What's happening?

10:07.790 --> 10:13.331
That Quimby fella promised
to build us a Matlock Expressway.

10:13.502 --> 10:16.622
How you gonna top that, smart guy?

10:17.470 --> 10:20.840
Well, how's this?
I'll not only build the expressway...

10:20.259 --> 10:22.631
...I will spend the remainder
of this afternoon...

10:22.803 --> 10:25.590
...patiently listening
to your interminable anecdotes.

10:25.764 --> 10:28.765
Hot diggety damn. Me first!

10:29.518 --> 10:35.230
Not many people know
I owned the first radio in Springfield.

10:35.190 --> 10:37.397
Weren't much on the air then.

10:37.568 --> 10:42.645
Just Edison reciting the alphabet
over and over.

10:42.823 --> 10:45.610
"A," he'd say.

10:45.784 --> 10:47.694
Then "B."

10:47.870 --> 10:51.155
"C" would usually follow.

10:52.374 --> 10:56.390
Mayor Quimby supports
revolving-door prisons.

10:56.211 --> 10:59.877
Mayor Quimby even released
Sideshow Bob...

11:00.490 --> 11:03.299
...a man twice convicted
of attempted murder.

11:03.469 --> 11:06.304
Can you trust a man
like Mayor Quimby?

11:06.472 --> 11:07.800
Vote Sideshow Bob for mayor.

11:10.976 --> 11:15.223
The League of Uninformed Voters
presents the Springfield mayoral debates.

11:15.397 --> 11:18.434
I'm your moderator, Larry King.
Now a word to our audience.

11:18.609 --> 11:21.314
Even though we're being
broadcast on Fox...

11:21.487 --> 11:24.274
...there's no need for obnoxious
hooting and hollering.

11:34.583 --> 11:38.248
I shouldn't have shaken hands
with those old people.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.551
I hope that flu doesn't affect
his performance out there.

11:45.719 --> 11:48.210
Don't worry.
He's taken a million of these capsules.

11:54.853 --> 11:57.771
Sideshow Bob,
Councilman Les Wynan...

11:57.940 --> 12:01.309
...says that you're not
experienced enough to be mayor.

12:01.485 --> 12:03.359
Sir, what do you have to say
about that?

12:03.529 --> 12:09.282
I'd say that Les Wynan ought to do
more thinking and less whining.

12:12.121 --> 12:15.572
- There's no Councilman Les Wynan.
- Good line, though.

12:15.749 --> 12:20.744
Mayor Quimby, you are well known,
sir, for your lenient stance on crime.

12:20.921 --> 12:24.456
But suppose for a second that
your house was ransacked by thugs...

12:24.633 --> 12:27.883
...your family tied up in the basement
with socks in their mouths.

12:28.530 --> 12:31.636
You try to open the door,
but there's too much blood on the knob.

12:31.807 --> 12:34.642
- What is your question?
- My question's about the budget.

12:48.741 --> 12:52.156
I don't agree with
his Bart-killing policy...

12:52.536 --> 12:56.486
...but I do approve of his
Selma-killing policy.

12:56.665 --> 12:58.954
Well, he framed me
for armed robbery...

12:59.126 --> 13:02.791
...but, man, I'm aching
for that upper-class tax cut.

13:07.926 --> 13:11.509
And the results are in.
For Sideshow Bob, 100 percent.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.900
For Joe Quimby, 1 percent.

13:13.182 --> 13:15.851
And we remind you, there is
a 1-percent margin of error.

13:21.607 --> 13:24.980
All right, let's go live
to Bob headquarters now...

13:24.276 --> 13:26.565
...for Mayor Terwilliger's
victory speech.

13:39.375 --> 13:42.375
And just look how happy he is.

13:55.641 --> 13:57.265
It's the rapture!

13:57.476 --> 14:00.181
Quick, get Bart out of the house
before God comes.

14:03.232 --> 14:06.149
So sorry, Mr. Simpson.
Your house is blocking construction...

14:06.318 --> 14:08.260
...of our new Matlock Expressway.

14:10.406 --> 14:12.660
Now, I am a fair man.

14:12.241 --> 14:14.447
You will have 72 hours to vacate.

14:14.618 --> 14:18.319
At that time, we will blow up your house
and any remaining Simpsons.

14:18.497 --> 14:20.655
Homer, we've got to stop them.

14:20.833 --> 14:23.324
I know what you're up to,
Mayor Terwigager...

14:23.502 --> 14:26.669
...and no one in my family's
gonna stand for it.

14:27.756 --> 14:29.998
Move your goddurn house, son.

14:33.950 --> 14:38.220
Bart, by special request of the mayor's
office, you are going to be left back.

14:39.351 --> 14:41.640
You mean I have to repeat
the fourth grade?

14:41.812 --> 14:45.644
Well, yes. But not for four or five years.
Bart, you're going to kindergarten.

14:45.816 --> 14:47.690
Kindergarten?

14:48.861 --> 14:52.360
Now, boys and girls,
who knows what this is?

14:52.573 --> 14:54.898
- Triangle.
- Very good, Bart.

14:55.750 --> 14:57.745
You have first choice of toys
for free play.

14:57.911 --> 14:59.655
Cool. I call the Flintstone phone.

15:03.542 --> 15:05.535
I like talking to you.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.880
We're gonna lose our house and end up
living under a bridge like common trolls.

15:13.520 --> 15:15.293
I don't think Bob
won that election legally.

15:15.471 --> 15:18.175
I can't believe a convicted felon
would get so many votes...

15:18.349 --> 15:20.637
...and another convicted felon
would get so few.

15:24.730 --> 15:28.644
Here you go. The results
of last month's mayor election.

15:28.817 --> 15:31.308
All 48,000 voters
and who each one of them voted for.

15:31.487 --> 15:33.812
I thought this was a secret ballot.

15:40.370 --> 15:43.702
Okay, Aaron A. Aaronson voted for...

15:43.874 --> 15:45.534
...Bob.

15:45.709 --> 15:48.810
Aaron L. Aaronson voted for...

15:48.253 --> 15:50.246
...Bob.

15:50.422 --> 15:53.542
Arthur B. Ablabab voted for...

15:53.717 --> 15:55.461
...Bob.

16:10.651 --> 16:13.189
Whoever wrote that note
wants to meet us here tonight?

16:13.362 --> 16:17.620
This is so cool, Bart.
We're just like Woodward and Bernstein.

16:17.241 --> 16:20.361
Except their dad wasn't waiting
in the car reading Archie Comics.

16:20.536 --> 16:23.821
Stuck-up Riverdale punks.
Think they're too good for me.

16:25.100 --> 16:28.669
You're on the right track.
Follow the names.

16:28.836 --> 16:31.124
How the hell do you know?

16:33.215 --> 16:38.126
I can't tell you who I am,
but I worked on the campaign.

16:39.847 --> 16:42.219
Hey, Mr. Smithers!

16:42.391 --> 16:45.511
Well, you might as well
give me a ride home now.

16:45.936 --> 16:48.605
I've never gone
behind Mr. Burns' back before...

16:48.772 --> 16:51.263
...but Sideshow Bob's
ultra-conservative views...

16:51.442 --> 16:54.775
...conflict with my choice of lifestyle.

16:56.196 --> 16:59.197
All I can do is give you one name.
Edgar Neubauer.

16:59.366 --> 17:01.822
Find him, and you'll find your answer.

17:07.915 --> 17:10.667
No Edgar Neubauer.

17:18.844 --> 17:21.679
This is hopeless. They're gonna
demolish our house for sure.

17:21.847 --> 17:24.172
We're gonna have to move
into a Motel 6.

17:24.348 --> 17:27.304
But Dad can't afford 6 dollars a night.

17:27.519 --> 17:31.387
Hey. Lis. Lis, come here. I found him.

17:31.565 --> 17:33.590
I found Edgar Neubauer.

17:36.700 --> 17:39.818
Oh, my God. The dead have risen,
and they're voting Republican.

17:39.990 --> 17:42.742
No, Bart. Don't you see?
Dead people can't vote.

17:44.411 --> 17:48.195
Look, "Prudence Goodwyfe.
Died, 1641."

17:48.374 --> 17:50.200
She voted for Bob too.

17:50.542 --> 17:53.496
So did Buddy Holly, Richie Valens,
and the Big Bopper.

17:54.964 --> 17:57.289
Even the pet cemetery voted for Bob.

17:57.466 --> 18:01.167
Look. Mr. And Mrs. Bananas,
Humphrey Boa-gart.

18:01.345 --> 18:05.390
Oh, my poor dead kitty,
please, not you too.

18:07.170 --> 18:10.433
All right, Bob, now it's personal.

18:10.604 --> 18:13.854
Hey. He did try to kill me.

18:42.100 --> 18:45.593
Mr. Mayor, is it true
you rigged the election?

18:45.764 --> 18:47.721
No, I did not.

18:48.392 --> 18:50.349
Kids, help.

18:52.620 --> 18:53.391
Oh, I don't mind.

18:53.564 --> 18:56.849
We want these children
to feel justice has been served.

18:57.260 --> 19:03.146
That way, they can sleep soundly tonight
on their hard, feculent motel pillows.

19:03.615 --> 19:07.827
Well, Bart, Lisa, here I am.

19:08.120 --> 19:11.489
I have a plan. I think we can trap him.

19:16.420 --> 19:19.670
You know, Sideshow Bob, I believe you
when you say you're innocent.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.667
- Indeed, I am.
- Because we all know...

19:21.842 --> 19:24.415
...you're a naive pawn,
puppet, if you will...

19:24.595 --> 19:29.138
...of the most diabolical political genius
Springfield has ever known:

19:29.308 --> 19:31.384
Birchibald T. Barlow!

19:34.688 --> 19:36.645
Wait...

19:36.815 --> 19:40.350
You don't have the intelligence to rig
an election by yourself, do you?

19:40.527 --> 19:43.612
- You were just Barlow's lackey.
- You were Ronnie to his Nancy.

19:43.781 --> 19:46.651
- Sonny to his Cher.
- Ringo to his rest of the Beatles.

19:46.825 --> 19:51.950
Enough! Lies, lies! I did it! I did it all!

19:53.999 --> 19:58.578
There. Is that what you want,
you smarmy little bastards?

19:58.754 --> 20:01.210
- We want the truth.
- You want the truth?

20:01.382 --> 20:05.545
You can't handle the truth.
No truth-handler, you.

20:06.303 --> 20:10.870
I deride your truth-handling abilities.

20:10.265 --> 20:12.258
- Will you get to the point?
- Yes.

20:12.434 --> 20:17.262
Only I could have executed such
a masterpiece of electoral fraud.

20:17.439 --> 20:19.183
And I have the records to prove it.

20:19.358 --> 20:25.640
Here, just look at these.
Each one a work of Machiavellian art.

20:27.783 --> 20:31.911
- But why?
- Because you need me, Springfield.

20:32.790 --> 20:35.662
Your guilty conscience may force you
to vote Democratic.

20:35.833 --> 20:39.416
But deep down inside, you secretly long
for a cold-hearted Republican...

20:39.586 --> 20:43.380
...to lower taxes, brutalize criminals
and rule you like a king.

20:43.215 --> 20:46.916
That's why I did this.
To protect you from yourselves.

20:47.428 --> 20:48.970
Now, if you don't mind,
I have a city to run.

20:51.140 --> 20:55.469
- Bailiffs, place the mayor under arrest.
- What? Oh, yes, all that stuff I did.

20:57.229 --> 20:59.767
Bart, we did it.
Now we get to keep our house...

20:59.940 --> 21:02.478
...and you get to go
back to the fourth grade.

21:02.651 --> 21:05.486
Tomorrow we were gonna find out
who the dish ran away with.

21:05.654 --> 21:08.691
- The spoon, Bart.
- Of course.

21:13.620 --> 21:16.325
Someday, I'll have my vengeance.

21:16.498 --> 21:21.493
Someday, when I find my way out of
this savage, roach-ridden cesspool.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.208
- Say, Terwilliger's a Yalie.
- Bob, come along.

21:26.383 --> 21:29.633
We need an eighth to row
against the Princeton alums.

21:29.803 --> 21:31.463
Princeton?

21:34.558 --> 21:37.960
Stroke. Stroke.

22:32.116 --> 22:34.192
