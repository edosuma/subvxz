<b>- Previously on </b><b><i>All Stars...</i></b>

00:02.102 --> 00:03.937
<b>Blessed be, Kitty Girl.</b>

00:04.004 --> 00:05.772
<b>- What the hell is going on?</b>

00:05.839 --> 00:08.342
<b>- You haven't seen</b>
<b>the last of me.</b>

00:08.408 --> 00:11.245
<b>The day of reckoning is upon us.</b>

00:11.311 --> 00:12.479
<b>- Y'all scaring me.</b>

00:12.546 --> 00:16.216
<b>[screaming]</b>

00:16.283 --> 00:20.287
<b>- How many of my eliminated</b>
<b>girls were you able to capture?</b>

00:20.354 --> 00:22.656
<b>- We think you'll be pleased.</b>

00:22.723 --> 00:24.825
<b>- Show yourselves.</b>

00:24.892 --> 00:27.661
<b>- Morgan of BenDeLaCreme.</b>

00:27.728 --> 00:31.098
<b>- Aja of Bebe Zahara Benet.</b>

00:31.164 --> 00:35.435
<b>- Chi Chi of BenDeLaCreme</b>
<b>and Shangela.</b>

00:35.502 --> 00:39.373
<b>- Wait a minute, just three?</b>

00:39.439 --> 00:40.674
<b>- Sorry we're late.</b>
<b>- Sorry.</b>

00:40.741 --> 00:42.009
<b>- Sorry, sorry, sorry.</b>
<b>- So sorry, oh, my gosh.</b>

00:42.075 --> 00:43.877
<b>- Sorry, sorry, sorry.</b>
<b>- Sorry, sorry, sorry.</b>

00:43.944 --> 00:46.914
<b>- Milk of Kennedy.</b>

00:46.980 --> 00:51.084
<b>- Thorgy of Shangela.</b>

00:51.151 --> 00:56.523
<b>- The time has come</b>
<b>for your revenge.</b>

00:56.590 --> 00:58.825
<b>[cackling]</b>

01:02.896 --> 01:04.631
<b>- Wait...</b>

01:04.698 --> 01:07.067
<b>Did I leave the iron</b>
<b>on in my dressing room?</b>

01:09.770 --> 01:11.238
<b>No, I'm good.</b>

01:11.305 --> 01:12.973
<b>[cackling]</b>

01:23.816 --> 01:25.284
<b>[sighing]</b>

01:25.351 --> 01:27.954
<b>- Good job, girl.</b>
<b>- Good job, bitch.</b>

01:28.020 --> 01:29.889
<b>- You were really fabulous.</b>
<b>"I love you bitches.</b>

01:29.956 --> 01:33.359
<b>Honestly, thank you from</b>
<b>the bottom of my heart."</b>

01:33.426 --> 01:35.728
<b>- [sighs]</b>

01:35.795 --> 01:37.029
<b>It's a bummer.</b>

01:37.096 --> 01:39.165
<b>I think Aja kind of</b>
<b>made us feel motivated</b>

01:39.231 --> 01:41.667
<b>that someone so young</b>
<b>was so good.</b>

01:41.734 --> 01:43.069
<b>- She was such a firecracker.</b>

01:43.135 --> 01:45.638
<b>It was just really, really hard,</b>
<b>but I know she is going</b>

01:45.705 --> 01:47.173
<b>to take everything from here,</b>

01:47.239 --> 01:49.575
<b>and she is going</b>
<b>to be unbeatable.</b>

01:49.642 --> 01:51.744
<b>I made the right decision</b>
<b>when I thought Shangy was</b>

01:51.811 --> 01:54.547
<b>the stronger contender,</b>
<b>but it's also sad</b>

01:54.614 --> 01:58.117
<b>because I know Aja</b>
<b>really wants to be here.</b>

01:58.184 --> 02:00.052
<b>To Aja.</b>
<b>- To Aja.</b>

02:00.119 --> 02:02.989
<b>- Love you Aja-poo.</b>

02:03.055 --> 02:04.857
<b>- Ooh, let me get</b>
<b>all this off.</b>

02:04.924 --> 02:06.525
<b>Help me Lord Jesus.</b>

02:06.592 --> 02:10.563
<b>- So girl, who you pick?</b>

02:10.630 --> 02:13.366
<b>- I also chose Aja.</b>
<b>- Oh, thank you.</b>

02:13.432 --> 02:17.203
<b>- It is obviously you helped me</b>
<b>last week, but besides that,</b>

02:17.270 --> 02:18.504
<b>you had a better track record,</b>

02:18.571 --> 02:20.573
<b>you've done more</b>
<b>with your time on "Drag Race,"</b>

02:20.640 --> 02:22.208
<b>and I believe that next week</b>

02:22.275 --> 02:24.877
<b>you would be doing things</b>
<b>maybe Aja couldn't.</b>

02:24.944 --> 02:26.312
<b>- Well, I'm so happy to be here.</b>

02:26.379 --> 02:28.581
<b>Thank you and thank you.</b>

02:28.648 --> 02:32.451
<b>When both BeBe and Trixie</b>
<b>choose me to stay,</b>

02:32.518 --> 02:35.354
<b>I'm like, honey, the work</b>
<b>has not been in vain.</b>

02:35.421 --> 02:38.057
<b>I do want the validation from</b>
<b>Ru, but I love having it</b>

02:38.157 --> 02:39.692
<b>from my sisters as well.</b>

02:39.759 --> 02:42.028
<b>Them saying, you know what,</b>
<b>you belong in this competition.</b>

02:42.161 --> 02:45.431
<b>I know I belong, but it's nice</b>
<b>to know they think that too.</b>

02:45.498 --> 02:47.600
<b>So we've been basing a lot</b>
<b>of stuff on track records.</b>

02:47.667 --> 02:50.069
<b>Where are we on track</b>
<b>records right now?</b>

02:50.169 --> 02:51.637
<b>BenDeLa has the most.</b>

02:51.704 --> 02:53.272
<b>- I have one win.</b>

02:53.339 --> 02:54.874
<b>- I have one.</b>
<b>- One, one, two, one.</b>

02:54.941 --> 02:57.276
<b>- But then if we go on bottoms,</b>
<b>then how many bottoms?</b>

02:57.343 --> 02:58.911
<b>- One.</b>
<b>- One.</b>

02:58.978 --> 03:00.079
<b>- How about you?</b>
<b>- Never.</b>

03:00.179 --> 03:01.614
<b>- Never.</b>

03:01.681 --> 03:04.183
<b>- I've been in the bottom twice,</b>
<b>but I really do just believe</b>

03:04.250 --> 03:07.753
<b>that the race is not given</b>
<b>to the swift or the strong,</b>

03:07.820 --> 03:10.423
<b>it's the one that endures.</b>

03:10.489 --> 03:12.358
<b>It's not about a track record,</b>

03:12.425 --> 03:14.594
<b>it's about who is there</b>
<b>at that moment,</b>

03:14.660 --> 03:17.630
<b>and that's what</b>
<b>it's about in my opinion.</b>

03:17.697 --> 03:21.000
<b>- It was clear what the criteria</b>
<b>was when it was like all of us,</b>

03:21.133 --> 03:24.303
<b>but now it's getting very,</b>
<b>like, personal viewpoints.</b>

03:24.370 --> 03:27.440
<b>We all have our own</b>
<b>individual scorecards.</b>

03:27.506 --> 03:30.142
<b>Ben has the most wins,</b>
<b>then Shangela, but,</b>

03:30.176 --> 03:32.478
<b>like, Shangela and I have been</b>
<b>the most with "Drag Race."</b>

03:32.545 --> 03:33.913
<b>We probably have</b>
<b>the biggest careers.</b>

03:33.980 --> 03:35.214
<b>That also matters.</b>

03:35.281 --> 03:37.583
<b>Kennedy is a [bleep] fabulous</b>
<b>competitor,</b>

03:37.650 --> 03:39.885
<b>but she has the worst</b>
<b>track record here,</b>

03:39.952 --> 03:41.320
<b>and BeBe won</b>
<b>"Drag Race" already.</b>

03:41.387 --> 03:43.389
<b>It's like apples and oranges.</b>

03:43.456 --> 03:46.993
<b>We're gonna have to pull</b>
<b>lipsticks we don't wanna pull.</b>

03:49.562 --> 03:51.664

<b>It's bad news, Brenda.</b>

05:31.030 --> 05:35.568
<b>I've decided to audition</b>

05:38.971 --> 05:40.439

<b>- I think it's</b>
<b>a crock of [bleep].</b>

06:27.820 --> 06:30.957
<b>It's not fair,</b>
<b>and it's not right.</b>

06:31.023 --> 06:34.760
<b>I'd rather one of us leave</b>
<b>and that be that,</b>

06:34.827 --> 06:37.597
<b>not let another bitch come in</b>
<b>and we've been working</b>

<b>by the legendary Emma Bunton</b>
<b>from the Spice Girls.</b>

06:57.617 --> 07:00.152
<b>- [cheering]</b>
<b>- Oh my God!</b>

07:00.219 --> 07:03.289
<b>- I can't believe</b>
<b>Baby Spice is coming.</b>

07:03.356 --> 07:05.758
<b>I spent a good part of my youth</b>
<b>pretending to be Baby Spice,</b>

07:05.825 --> 07:08.160

<b>- Oh, bitch.</b>

07:23.509 --> 07:24.844
<b>- I'm so happy to see you.</b>

07:24.911 --> 07:28.481
<b>- Baby, do not be fooled by</b>
<b>the hugs and the kissin'</b>

07:28.547 --> 07:30.616
<b>and the sissin' and the</b>
<b>whatever you wanna call it.</b>

07:30.683 --> 07:32.818
<b>Baby, the [bleep] is</b>
<b>about to hit the fan.</b>

07:32.885 --> 07:34.553
<b>- Great day to have never</b>
<b>drawn a lipstick.</b>

07:34.620 --> 07:37.189
<b>I never won a lipstick,</b>
<b>so I'm like hey, guys.</b>

07:37.256 --> 07:39.959
<b>- So you just wanna</b>
<b>coast through?</b>

07:40.026 --> 07:42.161
<b>- Shangela, I heard you</b>
<b>were really mad</b>

07:42.228 --> 07:45.498
<b>about my lipstick message</b>
<b>that I left.</b>

07:45.564 --> 07:47.900
<b>- To be very honest with you,</b>
<b>I was like not a big deal.</b>

07:47.967 --> 07:49.035
<b>- What did you think</b>
<b>I meant by that?</b>

07:49.135 --> 07:50.436
<b>- Time out.</b>
<b>I'm gonna let you know.</b>

07:50.503 --> 07:52.939
<b>So the lipstick message when</b>
<b>you told me to suck it,</b>

07:53.005 --> 07:55.574
<b>I told everybody in this room,</b>

07:55.641 --> 07:57.576
<b>she must have maybe been</b>
<b>in her feelings.</b>

07:57.643 --> 07:58.945
<b>- Cool.</b>

07:59.011 --> 08:01.781
<b>- Now, the next day, when</b>
<b>I discovered a note</b>

08:01.847 --> 08:04.250
<b>that was left for Trixie</b>
<b>that said,</b>

08:04.317 --> 08:08.154
<b>"Shangela is a [bleep]</b>
<b>shady [bleep] bitch",</b>

08:08.220 --> 08:12.058
<b>I was cracked by that.</b>
<b>- She posted that in her area.</b>

08:12.158 --> 08:13.993
<b>- This [bleep] letter again?</b>

08:14.060 --> 08:16.062
<b>- Posted it?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

08:16.162 --> 08:18.097
<b>- Well, Trixie, did you show</b>
<b>it to her to get her upset?</b>

08:18.097 --> 08:19.432
<b>- No.</b>
<b>- She hung it on the wall.</b>

08:19.498 --> 08:20.633
<b>- She put it on her wall.</b>

08:20.700 --> 08:21.667
<b>- It was obviously</b>
<b>done for a reason.</b>

08:21.734 --> 08:23.102
<b>- This is what transpired,</b>

08:23.135 --> 08:24.770
<b>because I can't have</b>
<b>this conversation again.</b>

08:24.837 --> 08:27.106
<b>- I can. I'd love to have</b>
<b>a conversation about feelings</b>

08:27.106 --> 08:28.608
<b>about me behind my back.</b>

08:28.674 --> 08:30.109
<b>Don't shush me Trixie.</b>

08:30.176 --> 08:31.477
<b>I'm sorry if you don't want</b>
<b>to talk about it anymore,</b>

08:31.544 --> 08:33.112
<b>but guess what, I do.</b>

08:33.112 --> 08:35.781
<b>I'm a little surprised that</b>
<b>like everyone got to see that</b>

08:35.848 --> 08:37.650
<b>and then judged me</b>
<b>while I wasn't here</b>

08:37.717 --> 08:38.818
<b>when it supposed to be</b>
<b>like a joke to her.</b>

08:38.884 --> 08:40.586
<b>- Girl, it was taped</b>
<b>on her wall.</b>

08:40.653 --> 08:41.887
<b>That's what I told Trixie.</b>

08:41.954 --> 08:44.156
<b>I said, that's between</b>
<b>you and your friend.</b>

08:44.223 --> 08:46.525
<b>I would've read the note</b>
<b>and like, girl, she crazy,</b>

08:46.592 --> 08:48.160
<b>and put it in my pocket.</b>

08:48.227 --> 08:50.930
<b>I wouldn't have posted it</b>
<b>where everybody could see.</b>

08:52.565 --> 08:54.133
<b>- I hate that note.</b>

08:54.166 --> 08:55.234
<b>- I never dragged you like that.</b>

08:55.301 --> 08:56.569
<b>It actually hurt my feelings.</b>

08:56.636 --> 08:58.271
<b>- It sounds like you</b>
<b>were really upset, girl.</b>

08:58.337 --> 08:59.772
<b>- No, I was.</b>

08:59.839 --> 09:01.540
<b>Because I had never called</b>
<b>you no shady [bleep] bitch.</b>

09:01.607 --> 09:03.943
<b>I would not have written</b>
<b>something like that about you.</b>

09:04.010 --> 09:05.745
<b>- No, you wouldn't.</b>

09:05.811 --> 09:07.380
<b>I was in my feelings.</b>

09:07.446 --> 09:10.283
<b>So moving forward, I had</b>
<b>time to contemplate</b>

09:10.349 --> 09:11.951
<b>why you chose my lipstick.</b>

09:12.018 --> 09:13.486
<b>What the hell was that about?</b>

09:13.552 --> 09:17.023
<b>- I always said I was hoping</b>
<b>to keep strong competitors,</b>

09:17.156 --> 09:20.393
<b>but in the challenge, I felt</b>
<b>like she had more to do--</b>

09:20.459 --> 09:22.795
<b>- And you guys had some</b>
<b>secret, like, shaking hand,</b>

09:22.862 --> 09:25.164
<b>like, oh, no matter what?</b>

09:25.231 --> 09:28.000
<b>- Okay, I'll answer your</b>
<b>second question next, okay?</b>

09:28.100 --> 09:31.570
<b>I felt like she had a</b>
<b>taller order in her challenge.</b>

09:31.637 --> 09:33.539
<b>She was asked to do 15--</b>

09:33.606 --> 09:34.640
<b>- That's not what</b>
<b>you just said that.</b>

09:34.707 --> 09:36.275
<b>- Hold on.</b>
<b>Baby, I ain't done.</b>

09:36.342 --> 09:38.477
<b>Numero uno, I said--</b>

09:38.544 --> 09:39.812
<b>- Girl, I love you.</b>

09:39.879 --> 09:41.414
<b>- Baby, you keep-- don't</b>
<b>start about loving me,</b>

09:41.480 --> 09:42.515
<b>because you keep</b>
<b>cutting me off</b>

09:42.582 --> 09:44.483
<b>while I'm trying</b>
<b>to say my thing.</b>

09:44.550 --> 09:45.718
<b>Either--I'll let you finish,</b>
<b>and then you tell me</b>

09:45.785 --> 09:48.588
<b>when it's my turn.</b>
<b>- All right.</b>

09:48.654 --> 09:50.489
<b>- Luckily the tables</b>
<b>are pretty heavy,</b>

09:50.556 --> 09:53.259
<b>so there was gonna be no</b>
<b>flipping of any sort of table.</b>

09:53.326 --> 09:55.261
<b>- You feel that the only</b>
<b>reason I kept Kennedy</b>

09:55.328 --> 09:57.463
<b>is because we're friends.</b>
<b>That's not true.</b>

09:57.530 --> 10:00.132
<b>I just felt like she had</b>
<b>more to do in the challenge,</b>

10:00.166 --> 10:01.934
<b>therefore, to me,</b>
<b>you were supposed</b>

10:02.001 --> 10:03.869
<b>to up the amount you did</b>
<b>in the challenge.</b>

10:03.936 --> 10:06.272
<b>It was a hard choice to make,</b>
<b>and I just made it.</b>

10:06.339 --> 10:07.473
<b>- And it happened to be me.</b>

10:07.540 --> 10:08.908
<b>- Yes, ma'am.</b>

10:08.975 --> 10:10.443
<b>- So when I come at you like,</b>
<b>I have the right to feel</b>

10:10.509 --> 10:12.044
<b>that way too because</b>
<b>it's how I feel.</b>

10:12.144 --> 10:13.679
<b>- I get it, no tea,</b>

10:13.746 --> 10:15.948
<b>and I hope we can still</b>
<b>be cool after this.</b>

10:16.015 --> 10:17.683
<b>- Let's just move forward.</b>

10:17.750 --> 10:19.485
<b>I also still love Shangela,</b>

10:19.552 --> 10:21.854
<b>but what I wanted</b>
<b>was like closure.</b>

10:21.921 --> 10:23.522
<b>I don't think I should've been</b>
<b>in the bottom two,</b>

10:23.589 --> 10:27.093
<b>however, Shangela didn't</b>
<b>put me there.</b>

10:27.159 --> 10:29.729
<b>- So Ben, what was your</b>
<b>criteria for sending me home?</b>

10:31.097 --> 10:35.401
<b>- We had talked about the</b>
<b>idea of wanting to keep</b>

10:35.468 --> 10:38.671
<b>the girls moving forward</b>
<b>who were performing the best.</b>

10:38.738 --> 10:40.840
<b>- No. We did not come</b>
<b>to no consensus on that.</b>

10:40.906 --> 10:41.974
<b>- No, you didn't.</b>

10:42.108 --> 10:43.943
<b>- And you had said that</b>
<b>you would knock</b>

10:44.010 --> 10:46.279
<b>those girls out of it,</b>
<b>so I was like, okay,</b>

10:46.345 --> 10:49.115
<b>if I make this decision now,</b>
<b>moving forward</b>

10:49.148 --> 10:50.483
<b>we'll all be on</b>
<b>the same page.</b>

10:50.549 --> 10:51.751
<b>It was a hard decision</b>
<b>to make at the time.</b>

10:51.817 --> 10:53.119
<b>- Had you said it--</b>

10:53.185 --> 10:54.587
<b>- But also keep in mind,</b>
<b>if that had been removed,</b>

10:54.654 --> 10:55.755
<b>I still would've thought</b>
<b>that you were</b>

10:55.821 --> 10:57.790
<b>the weakest performance</b>
<b>of the night.</b>

10:57.857 --> 11:00.559
<b>- But in appearance,</b>
<b>in performance, I didn't flub.</b>

11:00.626 --> 11:02.395
<b>If you'd listened to what</b>
<b>the judges said,</b>

11:02.461 --> 11:04.864
<b>there's no way that</b>
<b>I was weaker than her.</b>

11:04.931 --> 11:06.699
<b>But you should know this,</b>
<b>at least I was honest</b>

11:06.766 --> 11:08.367
<b>with everybody up front.</b>
<b>You changed it--</b>

11:08.434 --> 11:09.769
<b>- But I was honest</b>
<b>with you as well.</b>

11:09.835 --> 11:11.637
<b>- No you--</b>
<b>no, you weren't.</b>

11:11.704 --> 11:12.905
<b>Because you sat on</b>
<b>that white couch</b>

11:12.972 --> 11:15.775
<b>saying we're gonna do it</b>
<b>the way the judges want</b>

11:15.841 --> 11:17.209
<b>and we're gonna be sisters,</b>

11:17.276 --> 11:18.945
<b>and then at the last minute</b>
<b>you changed your mind.</b>

11:19.011 --> 11:20.346
<b>You have every right</b>
<b>to do that,</b>

11:20.413 --> 11:24.050
<b>but for me, that makes</b>
<b>you a coward.</b>

11:24.116 --> 11:25.851
<b>- Ooh, oh Miss Morgan is hot.</b>

11:25.918 --> 11:27.954
<b>Bitch, somebody must've</b>
<b>put hot coals down</b>

11:28.020 --> 11:31.023
<b>Miss Morgan's panties, honey,</b>
<b>'cause she is steaming.</b>

11:31.090 --> 11:33.326
<b>- So when you said I'm doing</b>
<b>the best for the girls,</b>

11:33.392 --> 11:35.795
<b>you basically told me</b>
<b>I wasn't part of that,</b>

11:35.861 --> 11:37.263
<b>and that's fine 'cause</b>
<b>you don't know me.</b>

11:37.330 --> 11:38.464
<b>- Well, you decided-- no,</b>
<b>I don't know you at all.</b>

11:38.531 --> 11:39.599
<b>- You sure don't.</b>

11:39.665 --> 11:40.666
<b>- Like I said,</b>
<b>super forthright--</b>

11:40.733 --> 11:42.201
<b>- Right.</b>

11:42.268 --> 11:44.403
<b>- --in saying that you didn't</b>
<b>want to play by the rules</b>

11:44.470 --> 11:46.238
<b>that the community--</b>

11:46.305 --> 11:47.673
<b>- But you understand what</b>
<b>a hypocrite is, right?</b>

11:47.740 --> 11:49.141
<b>- Ooh!</b>

11:49.208 --> 11:50.343
<b>Sister, I don't think</b>
<b>they're gonna find</b>

11:50.409 --> 11:52.612
<b>a bridge over troubled</b>
<b>water, unh-unh.</b>

11:54.480 --> 11:55.815
<b>- [RuPaul] Coming up...</b>

11:55.881 --> 11:56.782
<b>- I thought the least</b>
<b>you could've done was say,</b>

11:56.849 --> 11:58.284
<b>hey, Aja helped me.</b>

11:58.351 --> 12:02.288
<b>- You sat on this couch,</b>
<b>read my drag for feel.</b>

12:02.355 --> 12:03.689
<b>- What?</b>

12:03.756 --> 12:06.759
<b>- I don't owe nobody no apology,</b>
<b>point blank and simple.</b>

12:08.661 --> 12:09.395
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

12:10.561 --> 12:11.696
<b>[RuPaul laughs]</b>

12:13.197 --> 12:16.034
<b>- If you were judging the way</b>
<b>that you said you were judging,</b>

12:16.100 --> 12:18.002
<b>I should've still</b>
<b>stayed in the competition,</b>

12:18.069 --> 12:19.237
<b>and that's just flat out.</b>

12:19.303 --> 12:21.606
<b>So at the beginning of</b>
<b>the competition,</b>

12:21.673 --> 12:24.342
<b>DeLa made it seem like she was</b>
<b>going to eliminate the queens</b>

12:24.409 --> 12:26.944
<b>who had the worst critiques</b>
<b>by the judges,</b>

12:27.011 --> 12:28.413
<b>and she didn't do that.</b>

12:28.479 --> 12:31.649
<b>She eliminated me based on</b>
<b>the fact that I was going</b>

12:31.716 --> 12:34.052
<b>to send the strongest girl</b>
<b>in the bottom home.</b>

12:34.118 --> 12:36.521
<b>So now I'm calling</b>
<b>her out basically.</b>

12:36.587 --> 12:40.158
<b>- While I see that it's, like--</b>
<b>- Hypocritical?</b>

12:40.224 --> 12:41.993
<b>- There's, like--</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

12:42.060 --> 12:43.861
<b>- I see why there's hypocrisy</b>
<b>in that, which is why I said</b>

12:43.928 --> 12:45.730
<b>as soon as you walked out</b>
<b>the door that I'm trying</b>

12:45.797 --> 12:48.366
<b>my best to make the decision</b>
<b>I think is right</b>

12:48.433 --> 12:50.134
<b>for the competition over all.</b>

12:50.201 --> 12:51.636
<b>- I'm not a [bleep] idiot.</b>

12:51.703 --> 12:53.805
<b>DeLa will not own [bleep]</b>
<b>because DeLa's afraid of</b>

12:53.871 --> 12:56.407
<b>what the fans think, and</b>
<b>that's just straight up.</b>

12:56.474 --> 12:59.177
<b>- I mean...</b>
<b>- No other way you try</b>

12:59.243 --> 13:01.779
<b>and mince the words,</b>
<b>it's hypocritical.</b>

13:01.846 --> 13:04.315
<b>- I'm tuning out because</b>
<b>it does not help me</b>

13:04.382 --> 13:05.683
<b>to be present for this.</b>

13:05.750 --> 13:07.852
<b>Like I'm not available</b>
<b>to be vented at.</b>

13:07.919 --> 13:10.021
<b>[clears throat]</b>

13:10.088 --> 13:13.024
<b>- Okay, so this is how I feel.</b>

13:13.091 --> 13:15.059
<b>I wasn't mad that</b>
<b>you sent me home.</b>

13:15.126 --> 13:18.296
<b>I was more mad that when</b>
<b>the judges were like,</b>

13:18.363 --> 13:20.031
<b>we love the way you look,</b>
<b>we love your outfit,</b>

13:20.098 --> 13:22.967
<b>and you literally</b>
<b>just said thank you.</b>

13:23.034 --> 13:25.136
<b>And I just thought it was</b>
<b>kind of messed up because</b>

13:25.236 --> 13:26.337
<b>I thought the least</b>
<b>you could've done was say,</b>

13:26.404 --> 13:28.973
<b>"Hey, Aja helped me."</b>

13:29.040 --> 13:30.375
<b>- Really?</b>

13:30.441 --> 13:32.076
<b>Would it have changed anything?</b>

13:32.143 --> 13:37.815
<b>Hey, Judges, oh, she helped</b>
<b>me with part of my body.</b>

13:37.882 --> 13:40.251
<b>Would it have mattered</b>
<b>that nobody really liked</b>

13:40.284 --> 13:43.354
<b>what you have presented</b>
<b>on the runway?</b>

13:43.421 --> 13:45.423
<b>- I also feel like in</b>
<b>the deliberation, like,</b>

13:45.490 --> 13:46.824
<b>you're about to do right now</b>
<b>and cut me off,</b>

13:46.891 --> 13:48.459
<b>I tried to talk to you</b>
<b>and you kind of</b>

13:48.526 --> 13:50.161
<b>just spoke over me</b>
<b>the whole time.</b>

13:50.261 --> 13:51.763
<b>- Okay, great.</b>

13:51.829 --> 13:53.264
<b>I'm happy that you were</b>
<b>able to express that.</b>

13:53.264 --> 13:56.167
<b>First of all, I'm going</b>
<b>to say that your elimination</b>

13:56.267 --> 14:00.171
<b>was one of the toughest</b>
<b>for me and very emotional.</b>

14:00.271 --> 14:02.073
<b>- Here we go, Mother,</b>
<b>hear me out.</b>

14:02.140 --> 14:04.175
<b>I'm like what is with</b>
<b>these introductions.</b>

14:04.275 --> 14:05.610
<b>What are you, the queen of--</b>

14:05.677 --> 14:07.545
<b>shut up, just answer</b>
<b>the question.</b>

14:07.612 --> 14:10.214
<b>- I'm sorry if you feel that</b>
<b>I was talking over you.</b>

14:10.248 --> 14:13.484
<b>I feel like that was a moment</b>
<b>that I could really, really</b>

14:13.551 --> 14:16.421
<b>encourage you, and when</b>
<b>it comes to the runway</b>

14:16.487 --> 14:19.390
<b>everybody knows I don't talk</b>
<b>too much on the runway.</b>

14:19.457 --> 14:20.758
<b>I just don't.</b>

14:20.825 --> 14:23.861
<b>- But everybody on</b>
<b>the runway said who helped.</b>

14:23.928 --> 14:25.963
<b>I just think it's fair</b>
<b>because you're getting praise</b>

14:26.030 --> 14:27.865
<b>for something that it's</b>
<b>a design challenge</b>

14:27.932 --> 14:29.367
<b>and they're up there</b>
<b>thinking that</b>

14:29.434 --> 14:30.702
<b>you made that</b>
<b>from head to toe.</b>

14:30.768 --> 14:32.804
<b>- Aja, what I'm simply</b>
<b>saying is a compliment</b>

14:32.870 --> 14:36.507
<b>was given to me about</b>
<b>my garment, thank you.</b>

14:36.574 --> 14:39.243
<b>- Ah!</b>

14:39.277 --> 14:42.313
<b>Does it take that much</b>
<b>pride to like just take</b>

14:42.380 --> 14:43.614
<b>a step back and say,</b>

14:43.681 --> 14:45.717
<b>"Aja helped me a lot,</b>
<b>thank you so much."</b>

14:45.783 --> 14:48.019
<b>Does that really take that much?</b>

14:48.086 --> 14:50.521
<b>- [Aja] Whatever. I didn't come</b>
<b>here to argue with BeBe.</b>

14:50.588 --> 14:53.591
<b>I came here to continue</b>
<b>my run on the show,</b>

14:53.658 --> 14:56.627
<b>but if BeBe ends up in the</b>
<b>bottom, I will send her home.</b>

14:56.694 --> 14:57.862
<b>That's all I have</b>
<b>to say on that one.</b>

14:57.929 --> 15:00.164
<b>[laughs]</b>

15:00.264 --> 15:02.166
<b>- Since we're talking</b>
<b>about sending girls home</b>

15:02.266 --> 15:05.603
<b>and what the reasoning behind</b>
<b>sending somebody home is...</b>

15:07.105 --> 15:09.273
<b>I don't--</b>
<b>what was your reason?</b>

15:09.340 --> 15:10.475
<b>- You don't get why</b>
<b>I sent you home?</b>

15:10.541 --> 15:11.876
<b>- No.</b>
<b>- I have a lot of reasons.</b>

15:11.943 --> 15:13.211
<b>Okay.</b>

15:13.244 --> 15:15.380
<b>The first reason was during</b>
<b>the Bitchelor</b>

15:15.446 --> 15:17.081
<b>it was like a struggle for you,</b>

15:17.215 --> 15:20.084
<b>and I didn't find</b>
<b>not one moment funny.</b>

15:20.218 --> 15:23.654
<b>So for me, that was</b>
<b>the first X.</b>

15:23.721 --> 15:26.591
<b>Second of all, you sat</b>
<b>on this couch,</b>

15:26.657 --> 15:28.793
<b>read my drag for feel.</b>

15:28.860 --> 15:30.294
<b>That [bleep] hurt my feelings.</b>

15:30.361 --> 15:33.131
<b>Then you would have</b>
<b>chosen me to go home.</b>

15:33.231 --> 15:36.100
<b>- I think I would've</b>
<b>chosen Thorgy to stay.</b>

15:36.234 --> 15:38.903
<b>- That sent a shock through</b>
<b>my brain too, because I'm like,</b>

15:38.970 --> 15:41.239
<b>I thought we were</b>
<b>closer than that.</b>

15:41.239 --> 15:42.540
<b>- And you wanted</b>
<b>to save your friend.</b>

15:42.607 --> 15:43.775
<b>- Huh?</b>

15:43.841 --> 15:44.709
<b>- And you wanted to</b>
<b>save your friend.</b>

15:44.776 --> 15:45.977
<b>- No, that's not it at all.</b>

15:46.044 --> 15:47.445
<b>- That's exactly how it is.</b>

15:47.512 --> 15:48.813
<b>- Well, that's not it at all.</b>

15:48.880 --> 15:52.050
<b>Then you act like</b>
<b>your [bleep] didn't stink.</b>

15:52.116 --> 15:54.452
<b>You didn't even-- and see,</b>
<b>right, you don't even know</b>

15:54.519 --> 15:57.055
<b>what I'm talking about.</b>

15:57.121 --> 16:00.324
<b>I'm tearing up right now</b>
<b>because I just felt</b>

16:00.391 --> 16:02.293
<b>that there was nothing</b>
<b>genuine with you,</b>

16:02.360 --> 16:04.095
<b>and it just seemed</b>
<b>like Milk was only</b>

16:04.162 --> 16:06.731
<b>concerned about herself.</b>
<b>- What?</b>

16:06.798 --> 16:11.202
<b>- Milk just felt</b>
<b>like he was above everybody,</b>

16:11.235 --> 16:13.204
<b>and we all noticed that.</b>

16:13.271 --> 16:15.573
<b>Correct me if I'm wrong girls,</b>
<b>am I the only one?</b>

16:15.640 --> 16:17.208
<b>- No.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

16:17.275 --> 16:19.043
<b>- I just don't want</b>
<b>to jump in over anybody.</b>

16:20.478 --> 16:23.214
<b>- [Milk] It's really hard</b>
<b>hearing so many people chime in</b>

16:23.214 --> 16:26.617
<b>and just like subtly </b>
<b>raise their hand.</b>

16:26.684 --> 16:28.519
<b>I mean, they were basically</b>
<b>saying I'm an asshole.</b>

16:29.854 --> 16:31.856
<b>Am I an asshole?</b>

16:31.923 --> 16:33.725
<b>Why didn't you come up</b>
<b>to me and talk--</b>

16:33.791 --> 16:35.226
<b>I mean, you know</b>
<b>I'm approachable.</b>

28:55.503 --> 28:56.804
<b>- Yeah.</b>

28:56.871 --> 28:58.339

<b>Sometimes you just gotta</b>

29:09.650 --> 29:14.255

<b>I don't-- I don't know--</b>

29:14.355 --> 29:16.657

<b>make anything feel better, but</b>
<b>I just want you to know--</b>

29:18.793 --> 29:19.794

<b>to say anything.</b>

29:19.861 --> 29:21.229
<b>- Okay.</b>

29:21.362 --> 29:23.598
<b>- I'm not mad at your decision,</b>
<b>I was confused by it.</b>

29:23.664 --> 29:25.733
<b>I was like, but that's</b>
<b>not what she said.</b>

29:25.800 --> 29:28.936
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- And I felt like--</b>

29:29.003 --> 29:31.472

<b>right then and there or</b>
<b>it was never coming out,</b>

29:35.810 --> 29:38.846
<b>and it just kind of</b>
<b>verbal diarrhea'd, you know.</b>

29:38.913 --> 29:41.382
<b>And when I questioned you about</b>

29:41.449 --> 29:43.084
<b>well, that's, you know,</b>
<b>and I was like,</b>

29:43.151 --> 29:44.919
<b>is this bitch being smug</b>
<b>right now?</b>

29:44.986 --> 29:46.988
<b>- I just kind of glaze over</b>
<b>in those moments,</b>

29:47.054 --> 29:48.656
<b>and I don't always know</b>
<b>how people interpret that</b>

29:48.723 --> 29:50.792
<b>or if it feels like you</b>
<b>were saying, I seemed smug.</b>

29:50.858 --> 29:54.562
<b>Like, I just-- I'm like,</b>
<b>power down, can't deal.</b>

29:54.629 --> 29:56.531
<b>- I felt terrible the whole day</b>
<b>because I was like, bitch,</b>

29:56.597 --> 29:59.834
<b>I just came for her</b>
<b>too much without giving her</b>

29:59.901 --> 30:04.639
<b>a chance to even respond,</b>
<b>so I have to say I'm sorry.</b>

30:04.705 --> 30:06.674
<b>I'm confrontational.</b>

30:06.741 --> 30:09.010
<b>She's so anti-confrontational.</b>

30:09.076 --> 30:12.013
<b>Maybe had I come in a little</b>
<b>softer or less pointed,</b>

30:12.079 --> 30:14.081
<b>she would've responded</b>
<b>to me a lot different.</b>

30:14.148 --> 30:16.350
<b>Truce and peace and all</b>
<b>that kinda [bleep], yeah.</b>

30:16.350 --> 30:17.485

<b>No, I feel the same way.</b>

30:17.552 --> 30:18.953
<b>I really respect your work.</b>

30:19.020 --> 30:19.987
<b>- Honey, you [bleep] with me,</b>
<b>you're stuck with me.</b>

30:20.054 --> 30:21.823
<b>I'm not going [bleep] anywhere.</b>

30:21.889 --> 30:25.093
<b>- I'm pleasantly surprised by</b>
<b>this interaction with Morgan.</b>

30:25.159 --> 30:28.262
<b>Yesterday I saw a very specific</b>
<b>side of her that I think</b>

30:28.362 --> 30:31.699
<b>is really easy to pigeonhole</b>
<b>and today I'm seeing that,</b>

30:31.766 --> 30:35.336
<b>like, no, Morgan is like</b>
<b>a fully fleshed human being,</b>

30:35.403 --> 30:37.905
<b>and I'm so glad that</b>
<b>I was really hanging onto</b>

30:37.972 --> 30:39.640
<b>the idea of giving her</b>
<b>the benefit of the doubt.</b>

30:42.410 --> 30:43.644
<b>- I don't want</b>
<b>to hold grudges.</b>

30:43.711 --> 30:45.880
<b>I don't want to hold</b>
<b>regrets with Kennedy.</b>

30:45.947 --> 30:47.782
<b>Whatever I did hurt her,</b>

30:47.849 --> 30:51.319
<b>and so I'm gonna go about</b>
<b>trying to reconcile it.</b>

30:51.385 --> 30:54.021
<b>I don't want us to be,</b>
<b>like, angry at each other.</b>

30:54.088 --> 30:55.490
<b>- Yeah.</b>

30:55.556 --> 30:58.826
<b>I can say that I was probably</b>
<b>wrong for not at least</b>

30:58.893 --> 31:00.828
<b>making an attempt</b>
<b>to talk to you about it.</b>

31:00.895 --> 31:02.330
<b>- Yeah.</b>

31:02.363 --> 31:04.432
<b>I feel sort of like</b>
<b>shafted in a way that</b>

31:04.499 --> 31:09.237
<b>I was let to walk around</b>
<b>like a douche bag.</b>

31:09.337 --> 31:10.805
<b>- Here we go again.</b>

31:10.872 --> 31:13.808
<b>The fact of the matter is</b>
<b>Milk has a bit of an ego.</b>

31:13.875 --> 31:16.844
<b>Everybody praises him</b>
<b>for being a hot guy,</b>

31:16.911 --> 31:20.014
<b>and I think he kinda thinks</b>
<b>that translated</b>

31:20.081 --> 31:24.385
<b>into being a hot Milk,</b>
<b>but it doesn't.</b>

31:24.452 --> 31:25.920
<b>I mean...</b>

31:25.987 --> 31:28.990
<b>- Yeah, it would suck to hear,</b>
<b>but it sucks to hear it--</b>

31:29.056 --> 31:30.658
<b>- After the fact.</b>
<b>- --hardcore after the fact.</b>

31:30.725 --> 31:32.226
<b>- Yeah.</b>

31:32.360 --> 31:34.695
<b>- They've been allowing me to</b>
<b>just do this without ever, like,</b>

31:34.762 --> 31:38.800
<b>talking to me about it,</b>
<b>like, what is that about?</b>

31:38.866 --> 31:41.436
<b>I feel like Alexis Michelle,</b>
<b>when she's just like,</b>

31:41.502 --> 31:42.904
<b>guys, why did you let me</b>
<b>walk out on the runway</b>

31:42.970 --> 31:45.473
<b>in this blue dress and</b>
<b>this hideous fur?</b>

31:45.540 --> 31:49.811
<b>- But at that time I didn't</b>
<b>see anything genuine from you.</b>

31:49.877 --> 31:53.381
<b>I feel like if we had</b>
<b>that conversation then,</b>

31:53.448 --> 31:54.615
<b>I wouldn't have believed it,</b>

31:54.682 --> 31:56.017
<b>and I would've felt</b>
<b>like it was fake.</b>

31:56.083 --> 31:58.186
<b>- That's sort of, like,</b>
<b>painful that you would</b>

31:58.319 --> 32:00.822
<b>think my reaction would've</b>
<b>been disingenuous.</b>

32:00.888 --> 32:02.690
<b>- If I feel like you</b>
<b>this certain way,</b>

32:02.757 --> 32:06.427
<b>and I feel a sense of rejection,</b>
<b>then I'm just gonna shut down.</b>

32:06.494 --> 32:07.695

32:07.762 --> 32:09.330
<b>- You know?</b>
<b>And sometimes that's just--</b>

32:09.363 --> 32:11.599
<b>maybe that's just a</b>
<b>bad quality that I have.</b>

32:11.666 --> 32:16.537
<b>My reaction, it comes</b>
<b>from wanting to be accepted,</b>

32:16.604 --> 32:18.906
<b>very much so as a kid,</b>
<b>like, wanting to be</b>

32:18.973 --> 32:22.977
<b>in the in group and</b>
<b>not being accepted.</b>

32:23.044 --> 32:28.049
<b>I just leave it alone,</b>
<b>and I just stop trying.</b>

32:28.116 --> 32:29.851
<b>- I understand where</b>
<b>you're coming from.</b>

32:29.917 --> 32:31.419
<b>It's definitely something</b>

<b>- All right.</b>
<b>Recycle Kitty.</b>

41:42.516 --> 41:43.917
<b>- Yes.</b>

41:43.984 --> 41:45.452
<b>- Yesterday I was worried.</b>

41:45.519 --> 41:47.487
<b>You worked well with me,</b>
<b>you weren't standoffish,</b>

41:47.554 --> 41:49.022
<b>but it was literally tough.</b>

41:49.089 --> 41:52.792
<b>Today, the minute you hit</b>
<b>the stage, you nailed it.</b>

41:52.859 --> 41:54.194
<b>I was blown away.</b>

41:54.261 --> 41:56.129
<b>- I did see you have a</b>
<b>little trip on the heels,</b>

41:56.196 --> 41:59.900
<b>and I know how hard it is</b>
<b>to dance in those wedges</b>

41:59.966 --> 42:04.504
<b>because I've actually broken</b>
<b>my ankle a few times in those.</b>

42:04.571 --> 42:06.139
<b>Why did you choose goth?</b>

42:06.206 --> 42:08.742
<b>- Well, I was very angsty,</b>
<b>so I guess it was method?</b>

42:08.808 --> 42:09.976
<b>- Why were you angsty?</b>

42:10.043 --> 42:11.711
<b>- The eliminated girls</b>
<b>came back</b>

42:11.778 --> 42:15.715
<b>and there were a lot of</b>
<b>emotions about who had left.</b>

42:15.782 --> 42:17.584
<b>I was having</b>
<b>a terrible day yesterday,</b>

42:17.651 --> 42:19.519
<b>and this was a place</b>
<b>to channel it.</b>

42:19.586 --> 42:20.820
<b>- Thank you, DeLa.</b>

42:20.887 --> 42:22.222
<b>- Thank you.</b>

42:22.289 --> 42:24.124
<b>- Sparkle Kitty, Shangela.</b>

42:24.191 --> 42:26.493
<b>- Hey!</b>
<b>- This look is flawless.</b>

42:26.560 --> 42:29.029
<b>It's detailed,</b>
<b>the shoe is fantastic.</b>

42:29.095 --> 42:30.397
<b>Everything is perfection.</b>

42:30.397 --> 42:32.265
<b>- And I'm also getting into</b>
<b>this new</b>

42:32.399 --> 42:34.134
<b>Shangela padding</b>
<b>that we're seeing.</b>

42:34.201 --> 42:35.569
<b>- Just a little extra shape.</b>

42:35.635 --> 42:38.605
<b>- Girl, she got some</b>
<b>thunder thighs,</b>

42:38.672 --> 42:40.440
<b>and it's very, very womana.</b>

42:40.507 --> 42:44.044
<b>- But you are such a show woman,</b>
<b>the thing that I noticed</b>

42:44.110 --> 42:46.646
<b>most during your performance</b>
<b>was that it just felt</b>

42:46.713 --> 42:49.249
<b>a little bit more tentative</b>
<b>than it normally is.</b>

42:49.316 --> 42:52.018
<b>- I totally disagree.</b>

42:52.085 --> 42:54.487
<b>I could not take</b>
<b>my eyes off you,</b>

42:54.554 --> 42:55.755
<b>and I kinda like that it was</b>

42:55.822 --> 42:57.457
<b> just a bit downplayed,</b>
<b>a bit sexy.</b>

42:57.524 --> 42:59.960
<b>I really enjoyed</b>
<b>your performance.</b>

43:00.026 --> 43:01.328
<b>- That means a lot</b>
<b>coming from you.</b>

43:01.428 --> 43:02.996
<b>Thank you so much.</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

43:03.063 --> 43:04.431
<b>- And if y'all</b>
<b>ever do a reunion</b>

43:04.464 --> 43:05.999
<b>and you need a number six,</b>
<b>you can call me, okay?</b>

43:06.066 --> 43:07.968
<b>- I think you should come</b>
<b>and join us anytime.</b>

43:08.034 --> 43:09.603
<b>- Thank you.</b>

43:09.669 --> 43:13.440
<b>- Up next, Jungle Kitty,</b>
<b>BeBe Zahara Benet.</b>

43:13.440 --> 43:14.674
<b>- Hi, Mother.</b>

43:14.741 --> 43:17.444
<b>- I, of course, love the</b>
<b>leopard print cat suit</b>

43:17.444 --> 43:19.646
<b>because I hope that</b>
<b>Scary Spice was a bit</b>

43:19.713 --> 43:21.047
<b>of an influence on that.</b>

43:21.114 --> 43:23.617
<b>- All I have to say</b>
<b>is "raka tiki ta ta".</b>

43:23.683 --> 43:26.152
<b>Did I say that right?</b>
<b>What does that mean?</b>

43:26.219 --> 43:28.522
<b>- Honey, it is just</b>
<b>speaking in any language</b>

43:28.588 --> 43:29.890
<b>you're feeling at the moment.</b>

43:29.956 --> 43:32.425
<b>It's an emotion,</b>
<b>"raka ta ti ti ta ta".</b>

43:32.492 --> 43:33.760
<b>[laughter]</b>

43:33.827 --> 43:37.664
<b>- You cracked me up every</b>
<b>take yesterday</b>

43:37.731 --> 43:40.534
<b>because you were just</b>
<b>bizarre and hilarious,</b>

43:40.600 --> 43:43.870
<b>and today I was blown away</b>
<b>by how brilliant</b>

43:43.937 --> 43:45.572
<b>you were delivering it.</b>

43:45.639 --> 43:48.175
<b>- When you come out, there's</b>
<b>a presence that comes with you.</b>

43:48.241 --> 43:50.710
<b>There's a reason why</b>
<b>you won Season One.</b>

43:50.777 --> 43:51.845
<b>- Thank you.</b>

43:51.912 --> 43:53.513
<b>- Thank you, ladies.</b>

43:53.580 --> 43:58.418
<b>Based on the judges critiques,</b>
<b>I've made some decisions.</b>

44:00.420 --> 44:02.689
<b>BenDeLaCreme,</b>

44:02.756 --> 44:05.258
<b>BeBe Zahara Benet...</b>

44:06.693 --> 44:09.496
<b>you are the top two</b>
<b>All Stars of the week.</b>

44:09.563 --> 44:11.998
<b>Condragulations.</b>

44:12.065 --> 44:17.804
<b>You've each won a $1,000 gift</b>
<b>card to Spa on Rodeo,</b>

44:17.871 --> 44:23.410
<b>and a $1,000 gift card</b>
<b>from MuLondon.</b>

44:23.476 --> 44:27.247
<b>In a moment, you will</b>
<b>lip sync for your legacy.</b>

44:27.380 --> 44:30.116
<b>The winner of that lip sync</b>
<b>will have the power</b>

44:30.183 --> 44:33.587
<b>to bring back one of</b>
<b>the eliminated queens,</b>

44:33.653 --> 44:37.123
<b>and to give one of</b>
<b>your teammates the chop.</b>

44:38.658 --> 44:41.828
<b>While you queens deliberate</b>
<b>in the workroom,</b>

44:41.895 --> 44:46.299
<b>the judges will be</b>
<b>giving me a sponge bath.</b>

44:47.300 --> 44:48.501
<b>[laughs]</b>

44:48.568 --> 44:49.569
<b>- Thank you, Adam,</b>
<b>I'll be here all week.</b>

44:49.636 --> 44:50.670
<b>[laughing]</b>

44:52.305 --> 44:53.807
<b>- Coming up...</b>

44:53.874 --> 44:56.443
<b>- It hurts like hell because</b>
<b>I don't feel I didn't do bad.</b>

44:56.510 --> 44:58.411
<b>- I can't send her home.</b>

44:58.478 --> 45:00.213
<b>- As an artist, like</b>
<b>I have so much to give.</b>

45:00.280 --> 45:02.115
<b>- I want it so bad.</b>
<b>- I want to show more.</b>

45:02.182 --> 45:04.251
<b>- There will be a lot</b>
<b>of broken hearts.</b>

45:04.317 --> 45:05.418
<b>How do you win?</b>

45:06.520 --> 45:08.154
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

45:08.820 --> 45:10.422
<b>[RuPaul laughs]</b>

45:11.423 --> 45:15.027
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

45:15.093 --> 45:18.597
<b>- I feel for BeBe and DeLa</b>
<b>because not only do they have</b>

45:18.664 --> 45:21.066
<b>to bring back one of us girls,</b>

45:21.133 --> 45:24.770
<b>they have to send somebody</b>
<b>home from their group.</b>

45:24.836 --> 45:26.872
<b>Tough decision,</b>
<b>tough decision.</b>

45:26.939 --> 45:30.909
<b>- So I have a question for</b>
<b>Trixie, Kennedy, and Shangela.</b>

45:30.976 --> 45:32.511
<b>Knowing that you</b>
<b>killed the challenge,</b>

45:32.577 --> 45:34.112
<b>and to be told</b>
<b>that that was great,</b>

45:34.179 --> 45:37.349
<b>but you might be going home,</b>
<b>what does that feel like?</b>

45:37.416 --> 45:39.518
<b>- I'm like all over the place.</b>

45:39.584 --> 45:42.454
<b>Being that we have to go by</b>
<b>the rules, you know,</b>

45:42.521 --> 45:44.590
<b>I understand that's</b>
<b>what it has to be,</b>

45:44.656 --> 45:49.394
<b>but it hurts like hell</b>
<b>because I didn't do bad.</b>

45:49.461 --> 45:52.698
<b>It just sucks ass.</b>

45:52.764 --> 45:54.266
<b>It don't feel good.</b>

45:54.333 --> 45:57.736
<b>- Kennedy's upset because she</b>
<b>has the worst track record here</b>

45:57.803 --> 45:59.805
<b>and had</b>
<b>the harshest critiques,</b>

45:59.871 --> 46:03.342
<b>so I think she's feeling</b>
<b>like it could be her day.</b>

46:03.408 --> 46:04.710
<b>- Can we get, like, real?</b>

46:04.776 --> 46:06.578
<b>Is this hard for</b>
<b>you guys to consider?</b>

46:06.645 --> 46:10.315
<b>- It's-- um...</b>

46:10.382 --> 46:13.919
<b>I-- it's always hard,</b>

46:13.986 --> 46:15.220
<b>but I have less of a concept</b>

46:15.287 --> 46:20.092
<b>than I ever have of why</b>
<b>anyone should go home.</b>

46:20.158 --> 46:22.327
<b>I'm trying to pick through</b>
<b>what the reasoning</b>

46:22.394 --> 46:24.296
<b>would be to send anybody home.</b>

46:24.363 --> 46:28.967
<b>I'd love to talk to all three</b>
<b>of the rest of the five.</b>

46:29.034 --> 46:31.270
<b>- Same here.</b>
<b>- Come with me.</b>

46:31.336 --> 46:34.873
<b>- But it just--</b>
<b>it doesn't make sense to me.</b>

46:34.940 --> 46:38.644
<b>How do you-- how-- what do--</b>

46:38.710 --> 46:40.112
<b>- What are you gonna pick?</b>
<b>Oh, I know.</b>

46:40.178 --> 46:41.380
<b>- What do you do?</b>

46:41.513 --> 46:43.849
<b>Like, how do you even</b>
<b>think about this?</b>

46:43.915 --> 46:47.152
<b>I mean, like, how am I supposed</b>
<b>to even consider this?</b>

46:47.219 --> 46:50.555
<b>I don't have any clue.</b>

46:50.622 --> 46:51.890
<b>- I would just not pick me.</b>

46:51.957 --> 46:53.725
<b>- Okay, that's fair.</b>
<b>- No.</b>

46:53.792 --> 46:55.027
<b>I mean, Shangela</b>
<b>has more wins than me.</b>

46:55.093 --> 46:56.662
<b>I have a better track</b>
<b>record than Kennedy,</b>

46:56.728 --> 46:58.830
<b>and I got better</b>
<b>critiques today.</b>

46:58.897 --> 47:00.265
<b>- Yeah.</b>

47:00.332 --> 47:01.566
<b>- I know we're at the point</b>
<b>where everyone's fierce,</b>

47:01.633 --> 47:04.002
<b>but I felt exceptionally</b>
<b>fierce in what I did.</b>

47:04.069 --> 47:05.170
<b>- Yeah.</b>

47:05.237 --> 47:07.306
<b>You-- yeah, got</b>
<b>your groove back.</b>

47:07.372 --> 47:11.176
<b>Trixie has only had two weeks</b>
<b>to start to prove herself.</b>

47:11.243 --> 47:15.747
<b>She deserves more time here.</b>
<b>I can't send her home.</b>

47:15.814 --> 47:18.250
<b>- How are you feeling?</b>

47:18.317 --> 47:22.054
<b>- I'm not ready to go home,</b>
<b>that's all I can say.</b>

47:22.120 --> 47:23.488
<b>I'm not ready to go home.</b>

47:23.488 --> 47:26.191
<b>- In order to make a</b>
<b>really fair decision,</b>

47:26.258 --> 47:29.061
<b>I'm looking at the whole</b>
<b>entire body of work</b>

47:29.127 --> 47:31.396
<b>and if they still have</b>
<b>the fire to go on</b>

47:31.496 --> 47:34.866
<b>to the very last end,</b>
<b>because at this point, to me,</b>

47:34.933 --> 47:38.103
<b>that's what would really</b>
<b>differentiate everybody.</b>

47:38.170 --> 47:41.573
<b>- You know that</b>
<b>I'm 100 percent in this thing,</b>

47:41.640 --> 47:43.308
<b>but it comes down to you.</b>

47:43.375 --> 47:45.310
<b>- Right.</b>
<b>- And your decision.</b>

47:45.377 --> 47:49.114
<b>I need to go to the end,</b>
<b>point blank and simple.</b>

47:49.181 --> 47:50.649
<b>I need to go to the end.</b>

47:50.716 --> 47:54.019
<b>Just know in your heart who</b>
<b>you really want to be here,</b>

47:54.086 --> 47:56.521
<b>'cause that's</b>
<b>what it boils down to.</b>

47:57.856 --> 47:59.691
<b>- I'm wrecked, girl.</b>
<b>I'm rattled, bitch.</b>

47:59.758 --> 48:01.093
<b>- Are you?</b>

48:01.159 --> 48:05.530
<b>- I mean, I'm just so cracked</b>
<b>that you guys have</b>

48:05.597 --> 48:08.033
<b>to make a choice</b>
<b>out of the top five.</b>

48:08.100 --> 48:09.301
<b>Bitch, I'm nervous.</b>

48:09.368 --> 48:11.470
<b>It's just a toss-up</b>
<b>at this point.</b>

48:11.470 --> 48:13.905
<b>I just want to say to you,</b>
<b>I'm proud of you</b>

48:13.972 --> 48:15.574
<b>and the work that you've done,</b>

48:15.641 --> 48:18.644
<b>regardless of</b>
<b>this whole competition.</b>

48:18.710 --> 48:23.048
<b>- I have always been</b>
<b>so impressed by your work.</b>

48:23.115 --> 48:25.250
<b>I've been impressed by</b>
<b>the way that you bounced back</b>

48:25.317 --> 48:28.553
<b>from being booted out of this</b>
<b>room over and over again.</b>

48:28.620 --> 48:30.088
<b>- Over and over.</b>

48:30.155 --> 48:31.590
<b>- Shangela is a rock star.</b>

48:31.657 --> 48:34.293
<b>She has an incredible track</b>
<b>record in this competition</b>

48:34.359 --> 48:37.696
<b>so far, and she-- I--</b>

48:37.763 --> 48:40.632
<b>she belongs in the top</b>
<b>for this competition.</b>

48:40.699 --> 48:44.002
<b>It would be, like, kind of</b>
<b>insane to send Shangela home.</b>

48:45.504 --> 48:48.006
<b>- Bitch, you were in this</b>
<b>same place last week, honey.</b>

48:48.073 --> 48:49.875
<b>- I know.</b>

48:49.942 --> 48:51.643
<b>- How you feeling? Like...</b>

48:51.710 --> 48:53.078
<b>- I feel great.</b>

48:53.145 --> 48:54.379
<b>- Calm.</b>
<b>- Right.</b>

48:54.513 --> 48:55.948
<b>Pleased, happy.</b>

48:56.014 --> 48:57.316
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>

48:57.382 --> 48:58.383
<b>- They got my character,</b>
<b>they thought it was funny.</b>

48:58.517 --> 48:59.985
<b>The look worked for them.</b>

49:00.052 --> 49:02.254
<b>I feel proud of what I did.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

49:02.321 --> 49:05.057
<b>- So like, you know,</b>
<b>if it comes down to,</b>

49:05.123 --> 49:06.725
<b>we would've like you</b>
<b>in different hair,</b>

49:06.792 --> 49:09.528
<b>I'm like, well, that's</b>
<b>the point we're at.</b>

49:09.595 --> 49:11.697
<b>- There's a sense of calm.</b>

49:11.763 --> 49:13.632
<b>There's a sense of resolution.</b>

49:13.699 --> 49:18.337
<b>It's almost like she is ready</b>
<b>either way, but I love Trixie.</b>

49:18.470 --> 49:22.574
<b>Look at us trying to, like,</b>
<b>hug, and it's like--</b>

49:22.641 --> 49:24.142
<b>I feel Trixie is talented.</b>

49:24.209 --> 49:27.079
<b>I mean, it's top five, how do</b>
<b>you choose who's gonna go home?</b>

49:27.145 --> 49:29.815
<b>- Hey, again.</b>
<b>- Hey, again.</b>

49:29.881 --> 49:32.351
<b>- I mean, I wouldn't want</b>
<b>to be in your position.</b>

49:32.484 --> 49:34.486
<b>- Neither of us are</b>
<b>in great positions.</b>

49:34.553 --> 49:38.724
<b>- Well, you, at least you in</b>
<b>the position to stay, you know.</b>

49:40.492 --> 49:42.861
<b>But bitch, I'm definitely</b>
<b>not ready to go home.</b>

49:42.928 --> 49:46.765
<b>I don't know what else to say.</b>
<b>I just don't.</b>

49:46.832 --> 49:49.001
<b>- Kennedy is the lowest</b>
<b>ranking right now,</b>

49:49.067 --> 49:51.703
<b>but she keeps bouncing back.</b>

49:51.770 --> 49:54.273
<b>She's so consistent</b>
<b>in her temperament,</b>

49:54.339 --> 49:56.141
<b>which is so valuable.</b>

49:56.208 --> 49:58.510
<b>I can't send her home.</b>

49:58.577 --> 50:01.546
<b>It just doesn't feel fair</b>
<b>to send any of these girls home,</b>

50:01.613 --> 50:04.683
<b>and this idea just makes</b>
<b>zero sense to me.</b>

50:04.750 --> 50:06.785
<b>- Hey, ladies.</b>
<b>- Hey, sis.</b>

50:06.852 --> 50:07.953
<b>- Hi.</b>

50:08.020 --> 50:10.088
<b>- So it's turn to talk</b>
<b>to Ben and BeBe.</b>

50:10.155 --> 50:11.590
<b>We've got to plead our cases.</b>

50:11.657 --> 50:13.592
<b>- I really broke down</b>
<b>the episode I went home.</b>

50:13.659 --> 50:15.694
<b>It just-- the pressure</b>
<b>really hits me</b>

50:15.761 --> 50:18.730
<b>because I expect</b>
<b>so much from myself.</b>

50:18.797 --> 50:20.198
<b>I didn't think I was ready</b>
<b>to go then,</b>

50:20.265 --> 50:21.633
<b>and I'm ready</b>
<b>to come back now.</b>

50:21.700 --> 50:23.669
<b>As an artist, like,</b>
<b>I have so much to give.</b>

50:23.735 --> 50:26.371
<b>- Obviously I want to be here</b>
<b>just as much as anybody else.</b>

50:26.471 --> 50:28.473
<b>I want to show more,</b>
<b>but if that's not</b>

50:28.540 --> 50:29.908
<b>what's in the cards</b>
<b>for me, that's cool.</b>

50:29.975 --> 50:32.477
<b>If I went home tonight,</b>
<b>I could raise my head up high</b>

50:32.477 --> 50:34.379
<b>and say, you know what,</b>
<b>[bleep] rock on, bitches.</b>

50:34.479 --> 50:36.982
<b>- The only reason I can say</b>
<b>is because I want it.</b>

50:37.049 --> 50:38.483
<b>I want it so bad.</b>

50:38.483 --> 50:40.819
<b>I will jump off of</b>
<b>this building for it.</b>

50:40.886 --> 50:43.655
<b>- I saw you do it</b>
<b>in the talent show.</b>

50:43.722 --> 50:46.491
<b>- I was doing so well,</b>
<b>and I want to come back.</b>

50:46.558 --> 50:49.061
<b>This just means so much to</b>
<b>me because I've already been</b>

50:49.127 --> 50:53.065
<b>kind of like going on such</b>
<b>a better run than my season,</b>

50:53.131 --> 50:54.866
<b>so I want to continue it.</b>

50:54.933 --> 50:56.501
<b>I just want to be in the top.</b>

50:56.535 --> 50:59.137
<b>- Girl, this an easy one</b>
<b>for you with me, honey,</b>

50:59.204 --> 51:01.640
<b>'cause I feel like I got</b>
<b>a little bit more work to do.</b>

51:01.707 --> 51:05.577
<b>So bringing me back would</b>
<b>kind of be like</b>

51:05.644 --> 51:09.147
<b>beating a dead horse basically,</b>
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

51:09.214 --> 51:12.718
<b>Like, girl,</b>
<b>the horse dead already.</b>

51:12.784 --> 51:14.920
<b>I don't want to be</b>
<b>the Roxxxy of All Stars 3,</b>

51:14.987 --> 51:16.255
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

51:16.321 --> 51:18.857
<b>I realize when it's my time.</b>

51:18.924 --> 51:20.993
<b>You just gotta know</b>
<b>when it's time to go.</b>

51:21.059 --> 51:22.894
<b>- I know I don't need this</b>
<b>to prove myself</b>

51:22.961 --> 51:25.230
<b>because I've proved myself</b>
<b>in the outside world,</b>

51:25.297 --> 51:29.301
<b>but I feel I really grew</b>
<b>a lot and I learned a lot</b>

51:29.368 --> 51:31.570
<b>from my first experience,</b>
<b>and so I want to be able</b>

51:31.637 --> 51:37.109
<b>to have more experience</b>
<b>to grow even, like, bigger.</b>

51:37.175 --> 51:39.745
<b>I really [bleep] want this.</b>

51:39.811 --> 51:41.179
<b>I want to be brought back.</b>

51:41.246 --> 51:44.516
<b>I feel very deserving</b>
<b>to be brought back.</b>

51:44.583 --> 51:46.285
<b>- Thank you, ladies,</b>
<b>I love you all.</b>

51:46.351 --> 51:49.021
<b>There's just so many emotions</b>
<b>going on at the same time.</b>

51:49.087 --> 51:52.691
<b>All of these girls are</b>
<b>deserving of a second chance.</b>

51:52.758 --> 51:54.493
<b>I don't know how</b>
<b>I'm going to choose.</b>

51:54.526 --> 51:58.030
<b>- I think that there is</b>
<b>one queen in particular</b>

51:58.096 --> 52:02.167
<b>who has more to show here,</b>

52:02.234 --> 52:04.503
<b>and I want to give her</b>
<b>the second chance.</b>

52:08.573 --> 52:12.110
<b>- Now, when my fans receive</b>
<b>one of my limited edition</b>

52:12.177 --> 52:17.215
<b>collectibles from Tweeterhead,</b>
<b>they must be spotless.</b>

52:17.282 --> 52:18.951
<b>Emma, let's take a look.</b>

52:19.017 --> 52:22.454
<b>- Okay, here we go.</b>
<b>How's that?</b>

52:24.556 --> 52:27.726
<b>- Oh, Emma, it's filthy!</b>

52:29.061 --> 52:32.464
<b>I'm not mad at you,</b>
<b>I'm mad at the dirt.</b>

52:33.899 --> 52:35.167
<b>Silence!</b>

52:35.233 --> 52:37.736
<b>Bring back my dirty girls.</b>

52:38.971 --> 52:40.472
<b>Emma!</b>

52:46.511 --> 52:48.680
<b>- There's been four other</b>
<b>times that I've been standing up</b>

52:48.747 --> 52:52.250
<b>here in this position</b>
<b>deciding somebody's fate,</b>

52:52.317 --> 52:57.256
<b>and it is always a</b>
<b>really difficult decision.</b>

52:57.322 --> 52:59.157
<b>It's always really</b>
<b>hard to be here.</b>

52:59.224 --> 53:02.527
<b>What would you do?</b>

53:02.594 --> 53:05.230
<b>- When I'm looking at the box,</b>
<b>it's coming to life</b>

53:05.297 --> 53:08.133
<b>who I'm thinking would</b>
<b>be deserving to come back,</b>

53:08.200 --> 53:10.035
<b>but when it comes</b>
<b>to the top five girls,</b>

53:10.102 --> 53:12.671
<b>this is a very hard</b>
<b>decision to make.</b>

53:12.738 --> 53:16.975
<b>And no matter what I do, there</b>
<b>will be a lot of broken hearts.</b>

53:17.042 --> 53:18.443
<b>How do you win?</b>

53:19.811 --> 53:20.545
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

53:21.845 --> 53:23.314
<b>[RuPaul laughs]</b>

53:26.684 --> 53:28.652
<b>- Welcome back, ladies.</b>

53:28.719 --> 53:31.822
<b>Two All Stars stand before me.</b>

53:31.889 --> 53:35.426

<b>to impress me,</b>

53:35.492 --> 53:37.828

<b>earn the power to bring back</b>
<b>one of the eliminated queens,</b>

<b>and to give one of your</b>

53:49.840 --> 53:53.777
<b>The time has come</b>
<b>to lip sync</b>

53:53.844 --> 53:56.647
<b>for your legacy.</b>

53:58.048 --> 54:00.718
<b>- I have made my choices.</b>

54:00.784 --> 54:04.622
<b>I feel strong in my conviction</b>
<b>about these choices.</b>

54:04.688 --> 54:06.390

56:38.409 --> 56:40.577
<b>- Thank you so much.</b>

56:40.644 --> 56:44.081
<b>- BeBe Zahara Benet,</b>

56:46.650 --> 56:51.555
<b>Now, will the eliminated queens</b>

56:56.527 --> 57:00.731
<b>DeLa, which queen have</b>

57:00.798 --> 57:02.866
<b>to the competition?</b>

57:04.935 --> 57:09.340
<b>- I think that everyone here</b>
<b>is deserving of getting to be</b>

57:09.406 --> 57:11.542
<b>a part of this, and of getting</b>
<b>to show their talent</b>

57:11.542 --> 57:16.280
<b>to the world, and there's</b>

57:16.347 --> 57:20.384
<b>as much of an opportunity.</b>

57:20.451 --> 57:26.357
<b>So Morgan, get in here</b>
<b>and make me proud.</b>

57:26.490 --> 57:30.327
<b>- Condragulations, Morgan,</b>
<b>you are back in the game.</b>

57:32.896 --> 57:34.531
<b>- I don't like emotion.</b>

57:39.503 --> 57:41.872
<b>- Will the four</b>
<b>eliminated queens</b>

57:41.939 --> 57:43.841
<b>step to the back of the stage.</b>

57:46.110 --> 57:50.080
<b>Will the bottom three All Stars</b>

57:54.518 --> 58:00.357
<b>DeLa, which of your All Star</b>

58:00.424 --> 58:02.159
<b>to get the chop?</b>

58:04.428 --> 58:07.665
<b>- This is the easiest choice</b>
<b>I have had to make</b>

58:07.731 --> 58:09.633
<b>this entire season.</b>

58:13.771 --> 58:15.005
<b>I'm going home.</b>

58:17.174 --> 58:18.242
<b>- What?</b>

58:22.112 --> 58:23.747
<b>- What did she just say?</b>

58:23.814 --> 58:26.116
<b>Did she just say her own name?</b>

58:31.355 --> 58:36.126
<b>- I am so, so grateful</b>
<b>for my time here,</b>

58:36.193 --> 58:38.495
<b>both on the last season</b>
<b>and this season.</b>

58:38.495 --> 58:40.631
<b>I scribbled out a different</b>

<b>in whiteout, and let</b>
<b>me tell you why.</b>

58:42.933 --> 58:45.402
<b>I hope that you don't see</b>
<b>this as a sign of disrespect,</b>

58:45.502 --> 58:48.339
<b>because I see myself as such</b>
<b>a Drag Race success story.</b>

58:48.405 --> 58:50.407
<b>I had such a difficult</b>
<b>time on my season,</b>

58:50.507 --> 58:51.909
<b>even though I did well.</b>

58:51.976 --> 58:55.212
<b>I wanted this opportunity</b>
<b>to come back, to fight hard,</b>

58:55.279 --> 58:59.350
<b>to show myself what I can do.</b>

58:59.416 --> 59:03.153
<b>I have accomplished that.</b>
<b>I feel like a winner.</b>

59:03.220 --> 59:04.521
<b>I love these girls.</b>

59:04.588 --> 59:07.591
<b>I think they all deserve</b>
<b>a shot to win, and I--</b>

59:07.658 --> 59:09.760
<b>I'm incredibly grateful.</b>

59:09.827 --> 59:11.962
<b>I hope that you all</b>
<b>can see that.</b>

59:12.029 --> 59:15.199
<b>- I'm-- actually,</b>
<b>I don't know how...</b>

59:15.265 --> 59:16.400
<b>how to take this.</b>

59:16.533 --> 59:18.936
<b>- I feel so good.</b>

59:19.003 --> 59:21.639
<b>I feel like I'm going</b>
<b>home winning.</b>

59:21.705 --> 59:24.975
<b>- As it written,</b>
<b>so it shall be done.</b>

59:26.543 --> 59:32.383
<b>DeLa, you are and will</b>
<b>always be an All Star.</b>

59:33.851 --> 59:37.488
<b>Now, sashay away.</b>

59:39.056 --> 59:41.725
<b>- I love you guys.</b>
<b>I love you so much.</b>

59:41.792 --> 59:44.495
<b>- Ben wanted to leave on her</b>
<b>own terms, and good for her,</b>

59:44.495 --> 59:48.132
<b>but it's still kind</b>
<b>of like [bleep].</b>

59:48.198 --> 59:49.500
<b>We're just kind of like</b>
<b>over it</b>

59:49.533 --> 59:51.368
<b>because she's like</b>
<b>being omnipotent.</b>

59:51.502 --> 59:54.538
<b>- You guys win. I won.</b>
<b>I love you.</b>

59:54.605 --> 59:57.041
<b>- It just seems so like--</b>

59:57.107 --> 59:58.642
<b>- Thank you all.</b>

1:00:00.511 --> 1:00:02.279
<b>- What the [bleep]</b>
<b>is happening.</b>

1:00:02.346 --> 1:00:06.016
<b>Not BenDeLaChrist, savior</b>
<b>of Morgan and the drag queens.</b>

1:00:06.083 --> 1:00:08.052
<b>But I don't know if that's</b>
<b>gonna look good or bad.</b>

1:00:10.087 --> 1:00:12.022
<b>Honestly.</b>

1:00:12.089 --> 1:00:13.824
<b>- Thanks for letting me be</b>
<b>my kind of winner.</b>

1:00:13.891 --> 1:00:15.526
<b>I had a real good time.</b>

1:00:18.262 --> 1:00:19.663
<b>I was looking over</b>
<b>those lipsticks,</b>

1:00:19.730 --> 1:00:22.933
<b>and none of those answers</b>
<b>felt right to me,</b>

1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:26.503
<b>so I made my own rules,</b>
<b>and I feel great about it.</b>

1:00:26.570 --> 1:00:29.239
<b>It's like I proved</b>
<b>everything I have to prove.</b>

1:00:29.306 --> 1:00:34.178

<b>had their struggles and</b>
<b>I'm delighted to get</b>

1:00:44.688 --> 1:00:49.326
<b>to give them the opportunity</b>
<b>to live another week.</b>

1:00:49.393 --> 1:00:51.729
<b>I think the actual title</b>
<b>is more important to them</b>

1:00:51.795 --> 1:00:53.497
<b>than it is to me.</b>

1:00:56.834 --> 1:00:59.503
<b>- Well, condragulations,</b>

1:00:59.536 --> 1:01:04.575
<b>and ladies,</b>
<b>no more white out!</b>

1:01:04.642 --> 1:01:07.111
<b>And remember, if you</b>

<b>how in the hell you gonna</b>
<b>love somebody else?</b>

1:01:08.946 --> 1:01:10.180
<b>Can I get an amen up in here?</b>

1:01:10.247 --> 1:01:11.915
<b>- Amen.</b>
<b>- All right.</b>
