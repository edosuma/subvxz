00:33.958 --> 00:35.875
[dramatic music playing]

01:13.166 --> 01:15.291
[coughing]

01:19.708 --> 01:21.708
[indistinct chattering]

01:28.625 --> 01:32.916
Hey, Snow, it's-- it's good to see you.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.375
Did they come in?

01:34.458 --> 01:38.958
Oh, uh, it's getting harder and harder
to bring the real stuff in from Earth.

01:39.458 --> 01:41.250
It's getting expensive.

01:41.750 --> 01:45.500
Maybe I could interest you
in some synthetic analogs.

01:45.583 --> 01:48.250
[Snow] Maybe you should
shut the fuck up and give me my stuff.

01:57.083 --> 01:59.750
Order another two kilos.
I'll be back in a month.

02:09.166 --> 02:11.000
[indistinct chattering]

02:14.625 --> 02:15.875
[Snow] Thanks.

02:25.125 --> 02:27.041
You're Snow, the albino.

02:28.291 --> 02:31.583
-No, I'm not.
-Now, don't fuck with me.

02:31.666 --> 02:33.250
I'm not fucking with you.

02:34.625 --> 02:37.250
My name is Jelda Conley.
They call me Whitey.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.541
Bounty hunters, right?

02:40.916 --> 02:43.291
What's he done, this... Snow guy?

02:43.375 --> 02:46.791
No, it's not me wants him.
It's the merchant, Baris.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.791
There's a big reward for his balls.

02:50.666 --> 02:53.583
Balls? As in, testicles?

02:55.416 --> 02:56.416
[chuckles]

02:56.500 --> 02:59.833
-Now, why the hell would Baris want those?
-My job ends at the taking.

03:01.708 --> 03:05.083
Now, whether you're him or not...

03:05.666 --> 03:07.000
I challenge you.

03:08.458 --> 03:09.291
Listen...

03:10.708 --> 03:14.291
I've never killed anyone who didn't try
to kill me first, so just move on.

03:14.375 --> 03:17.250
I said I challenge you!

03:17.333 --> 03:19.291
Everyone here heard it!

03:21.416 --> 03:23.458
That puts me within my rights.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.958
So stand up.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.375
-[slice]
-[grunts]

03:53.875 --> 03:55.500
I mean you no harm.

03:56.208 --> 03:57.541
Unless harm is meant.

03:59.916 --> 04:01.041
Best I get gone.

04:04.125 --> 04:05.666
Well, thanks for the help.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.500
Oh.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.583
Found him. Get the team together.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.208
[growling]

04:32.166 --> 04:34.041
[footsteps approaching]

04:34.125 --> 04:35.250
Shit.

05:01.541 --> 05:02.375
Sorry.

05:02.875 --> 05:05.416
-Not used to company.
-That's okay. I'm not hungry.

05:07.458 --> 05:09.000
But I wanna travel with you.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.291
My name is Hirald.

05:13.875 --> 05:16.500
I'm crossing the Thiran plain.
It's not easy.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.250
I have no problem with that.

05:20.791 --> 05:22.000
I'll think about it.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.541
Don't you have a day tent?

05:36.083 --> 05:37.375
You can share mine.

05:39.125 --> 05:40.333
[cawing]

05:45.791 --> 05:50.250
Not much... but it'll protect us
from the worst of the heat.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.041
Always been a fast healer.

06:11.666 --> 06:12.666
Uh...

06:44.000 --> 06:46.291
[Snow]
You should know why Baris is after me.

06:46.375 --> 06:47.791
Why he wants my...

06:48.416 --> 06:50.083
Testicles, yes.

06:50.791 --> 06:54.208
There's something unique
about the gonadotropin-releasing hormone

06:54.291 --> 06:55.458
your body produces.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.833
Your cells are regenerative.

06:58.583 --> 07:00.875
And hence, immortal.

07:01.416 --> 07:03.083
Your hand will grow back in...

07:03.875 --> 07:05.041
a week?

07:07.333 --> 07:08.375
[Snow] Maybe less.

07:12.291 --> 07:14.791
I work for Earth Central Intelligence.

07:15.541 --> 07:19.083
They want the same things as Baris,
but I'm no bounty hunter.

07:20.250 --> 07:23.083
-They wish you to come willingly.
-Why?

07:23.166 --> 07:25.958
Because whoever decodes
your reproductive system

07:26.041 --> 07:29.041
controls, in effect, immortality.

07:30.125 --> 07:33.541
This knowledge could destabilize
the entire Protectorate.

07:33.625 --> 07:36.208
Why not just kill me? Problem solved.

07:36.291 --> 07:38.833
Earth Central does not suppress knowledge.

07:39.666 --> 07:43.625
Morality's a human construct.
I thought AIs didn't give a shit.

07:43.708 --> 07:46.416
They were created
to protect the greater good.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.333
Will you come?

07:51.583 --> 07:55.000
Two days should bring us to my home.
We should keep moving.

08:05.958 --> 08:06.791
Here.

08:15.708 --> 08:17.250
[creaking]

08:20.041 --> 08:22.500
[Snow]
I found this place about 200 years ago.

08:23.208 --> 08:25.208
Been improving it ever since.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.541
[dramatic music playing]

08:43.750 --> 08:45.875
Just how long have you been alive?

08:47.166 --> 08:48.708
Make yourself comfortable.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.500
You'll find clothes
in the back and a shower.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.125
There's plenty of water here.

09:04.833 --> 09:05.833
[sighs]

09:11.541 --> 09:12.375
Mm...

09:18.458 --> 09:19.708
Whose dress is this?

09:21.750 --> 09:22.583
My wife's.

09:25.208 --> 09:27.583
She killed herself 123 years ago.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.125
Why?

09:32.458 --> 09:33.500
She grew old.

09:36.291 --> 09:37.250
I didn't.

10:17.208 --> 10:19.583
[alarm ringing]

10:20.041 --> 10:20.916
Snow?

10:41.541 --> 10:42.583
[guns cocking]

10:46.916 --> 10:49.458
Time to get your hands dirty, Baris.

10:53.333 --> 10:54.500
Shall we?

11:10.791 --> 11:13.166
[Trot over radio]
Meck? Are you in position?

11:14.333 --> 11:15.166
Meck?

11:17.458 --> 11:19.083
-Trot
-Check on her.

11:20.416 --> 11:22.416
[ominous music playing]

11:26.375 --> 11:28.250
Snow's here. He got Meck.

11:33.791 --> 11:35.166
[intense music playing]

11:36.250 --> 11:37.250
[crack]

11:54.208 --> 11:55.833
-Stop!
-[woman grunts]

11:57.083 --> 11:57.916
Jharit.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.041
Baby.

12:06.458 --> 12:07.458
[Trot] What was that?

12:08.250 --> 12:09.916
Fucker killed Jharilla.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.458
He's coming your way.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.708
[intense music playing]

12:30.625 --> 12:32.541
[choking]

12:42.833 --> 12:45.416
That was my wife you killed, you fucker.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.416
After I've snipped your sack,

12:48.500 --> 12:51.500
I'm gonna take my time
cutting all the rest.

13:05.875 --> 13:07.041
[gasps]

13:14.458 --> 13:16.333
It makes no sense, Snow.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.625
You've been alive for centuries.

13:21.041 --> 13:27.416
And yet you choose to live here,
on this backwater shithole of a planet.

13:28.666 --> 13:30.250
Well, now you'll die here.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.500
[groans]

13:36.500 --> 13:38.708
[dramatic music playing]

13:55.041 --> 13:56.041
[gasping]

14:04.875 --> 14:05.958
[inhales sharply]

14:11.916 --> 14:13.291
You're synthetic?

14:14.625 --> 14:15.458
No.

14:22.041 --> 14:24.708
I was in an accident a long time ago.

14:25.875 --> 14:27.875
Underneath the synthflesh and ceramal...

14:29.000 --> 14:32.375
there is a spinal column, nerve tissue...

14:34.083 --> 14:35.625
and a mostly-human brain.

14:38.375 --> 14:39.208
Me.

14:41.583 --> 14:44.208
I've been alone a long time too.

14:55.125 --> 14:57.125
[dramatic music playing]

15:21.916 --> 15:23.916
[dramatic music playing]
