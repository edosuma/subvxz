01:08.242 --> 01:10.374
[man]
I've been working
alone for a long time.

01:11.984 --> 01:15.249
4,455 days.

01:15.292 --> 01:18.252
12 hours, 19 minutes.

01:18.295 --> 01:19.731
But who's counting?

01:22.517 --> 01:24.693
I never asked
who I'm working for.

01:26.129 --> 01:28.175
Asking will only
get me into trouble.

01:29.872 --> 01:31.874
And I don't want
any trouble these days.

01:38.620 --> 01:41.491
Everybody knows a good hit man
takes no prisoners,

01:41.536 --> 01:44.408
tells no lies and leaves
without a trace, right?

01:46.410 --> 01:50.458
Except I've never been
that good at the whole
leaving without a trace thing.

01:52.547 --> 01:55.202
I usually leave
a pretty big fucking trace.

01:58.553 --> 02:01.512
When I was a kid, I wasn't
very good at a lot of things.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.081
I wasn't good
at football or soccer.

02:07.301 --> 02:09.738
I think everybody has
one thing they're good at.

02:10.826 --> 02:12.436
One superpower.

02:12.480 --> 02:16.397
[light music]

02:18.094 --> 02:20.401
My superpower is that
I'm really good at

02:20.444 --> 02:22.925
letting other people
make my decisions for me.

02:25.014 --> 02:26.537
Because the way I look at life,

02:27.408 --> 02:29.627
if I don't have to
make my own decisions,

02:30.715 --> 02:32.413
then I can't make any mistakes.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.331
And if I can't make
any mistakes, then I win.

02:38.245 --> 02:41.465
And deep down, we all just
want to be winners, right?

[man]
You want to know why I go
by the name, The Badger?

06:16.245 --> 06:18.247
Because my real name is Dean...

06:19.248 --> 06:22.860
and that's like,
the most uncool name ever.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.384
Dean. The hit man.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.866
Plus, badgers are ferocious.

06:31.129 --> 06:33.175
They'll bite the testicles
off a grizzly bear
if they're cornered...

06:35.177 --> 06:36.613
or at least that's what I heard.

06:41.096 --> 06:42.750
But that's not
how I got the name.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.755
My wife gave me that name
before she died.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.502
No, I didn't kill her.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.070
I sure wanted to sometimes...

07:01.464 --> 07:02.944
but cancer got her first.

07:14.608 --> 07:18.307
[woman yelling in distance]

07:25.009 --> 07:28.491
Being a hit man
is not as exciting
as I thought it would be.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.319
[siren wailing in distance]

07:30.362 --> 07:32.930
Most of the time
I'm just waiting around.

07:35.063 --> 07:37.848
Sometimes I wait for weeks
and then I only work for,

07:37.892 --> 07:39.937
like, 15 minutes, and it's over.

07:41.025 --> 07:43.767
It gives me
way too much time to think.

07:45.334 --> 07:48.859
You wouldn't believe some
of the crazy shit I think about.

07:48.903 --> 07:51.514
Like, who killed the Kennedys?

07:51.558 --> 07:54.256
Can people time travel
in the future?

07:54.299 --> 07:57.259
Are we all living in a hologram?
Are aliens real?

08:01.045 --> 08:02.873
Well, personally,
I think they are.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.269
You'd have to be a moron
to think that a bunch
of monkeys with guns

08:07.312 --> 08:10.098
were the highest forms
of intelligence in the universe.

08:14.711 --> 08:18.367
[phone ringing]

08:23.938 --> 08:25.896
[man over phone]
Is this the man
they called The Badger?

08:27.028 --> 08:28.812
Yeah, that might be me.

08:31.032 --> 08:33.381
[man over phone]
It's kind of a funny name.

08:33.424 --> 08:35.427
Badger, no?

08:35.471 --> 08:37.995
[Dean]
Well, "Wolverine"
was already taken, so.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.475
[man laughs]

08:41.520 --> 08:43.260
[man over phone]
And he has a sense of humor.
Do I like this guy?

08:44.131 --> 08:45.525
Okay, Badger.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.223
Someone wants to talk to you.

08:51.487 --> 08:55.752
[man 2 over phone]
Okay. Guess what
they want you to do next?

08:55.796 --> 08:58.233
This is Marcella Horvathova.

08:58.276 --> 09:01.715
She's the closest thing
Vasily has to family.

09:01.758 --> 09:05.719
He kidnapped her
when she was 13. Sick fuck.

09:05.762 --> 09:09.026
We need you to make contact
and find out everything
you can about her.

09:11.115 --> 09:13.291
We'll place you across
the street from her apartment.

09:14.641 --> 09:15.990
But you can start here.

09:17.644 --> 09:20.298
She's the girl
in the upper right-hand corner.

09:20.342 --> 09:23.084
You can find her online
most nights down at 10:00 p.m.

09:25.303 --> 09:27.349
It's an easy job for The Badger.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.135

for, like, ten years.

Now he thinks
he is Jesus or something.

15:16.437 --> 15:17.786

I just scraped it up.

Does it hurt?

[Dean]
I've always wondered
where thoughts come from.

40:05.664 --> 40:08.710
It's like somebody
hits a download button,

40:08.754 --> 40:11.974
and they come flooding in
from a quadrillion miles away.

40:13.454 --> 40:15.456
And then it takes a while
to process them.

40:16.979 --> 40:20.287
If you process them too quickly,
you can make mistakes.

40:21.897 --> 40:24.465
And if you don't
process them quick enough,

40:24.509 --> 40:26.162
sometimes they disappear.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.515
But sometimes
they never disappear.

40:32.386 --> 40:35.389
They'll haunt you till your
grave if you don't act on them.

40:50.099 --> 40:51.579
I don't believe in redemption.

40:54.103 --> 40:57.063
I don't think
you're going to erase your past
by forgiving yourself.

40:59.935 --> 41:01.937
But I do believe in revenge.

41:01.981 --> 41:04.853
[typing]

41:04.897 --> 41:06.986
And sometimes
revenge and redemption...

41:08.727 --> 41:10.685

I'm in town on a contract

But before I go,
I just need to know one thing.

Do you want to know what
it feels like to truly be free?

41:51.770 --> 41:52.858

It's okay. I don't either.

44:28.535 --> 44:30.232

You junkie!

[muffled scream]

59:45.146 --> 59:46.234

1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:37.476
[Marcella]
I have different hair.

[muffled dialogue]

1:02:25.089 --> 1:02:26.743
[Marcella]
You're going to pay now

1:02:26.786 --> 1:02:28.396
for everything
you've done to me, Vasily.

1:02:29.571 --> 1:02:32.009
[Vasily]
It's a kill-
or-be-killed world, Marcella.

1:02:32.052 --> 1:02:33.184
[Dean]
Stay with me...

1:02:34.707 --> 1:02:37.536
and I promise you
you'll never have to run again.

1:02:37.579 --> 1:02:40.452
-[Vasily] I'm always
the one with the gun.
-[Marcella] No!

1:02:43.847 --> 1:02:45.762
I know you want this.

1:02:46.980 --> 1:02:48.547
What the fuck are you doing?

What are you guys
walking around for? Hustle!

1:03:45.299 --> 1:03:46.605
[man 2]
16 clear!

1:03:57.877 --> 1:03:59.096
[man 3]
Take this upstairs.

1:04:01.794 --> 1:04:02.969
[man 4]
Alright. Pack up.

1:04:07.147 --> 1:04:09.193
[man 1]
Big box, small box, let's go!

1:04:12.936 --> 1:04:15.939

1:04:18.376 --> 1:04:19.856

1:04:21.988 --> 1:04:23.772
Let's go! Move!

1:04:23.816 --> 1:04:25.644
Box up the truck.

1:04:25.687 --> 1:04:26.775
Move it.

1:04:29.778 --> 1:04:31.606
Let's go! Move!

You should keep
your door locked, bitch.

1:15:14.684 --> 1:15:16.337
[Dean]
I don't believe in redemption.

1:15:18.688 --> 1:15:21.691
I don't think
you're going to erase your past
by forgiving yourself.

1:15:24.911 --> 1:15:27.044
But I do believe in revenge.

1:15:29.612 --> 1:15:32.136
And sometimes
revenge and redemption....

1:15:33.398 --> 1:15:35.094
can look awfully similar.

1:15:38.316 --> 1:15:41.362
[dramatic music]

1:16:16.397 --> 1:16:18.791
I think everybody
has one thing they're good at.

1:16:20.184 --> 1:16:21.577
One superpower.

1:16:24.405 --> 1:16:26.712
My superpower is that
I'm really good at

1:16:26.755 --> 1:16:29.236
letting other people
make my decisions for me.

1:16:31.543 --> 1:16:33.240
Because the way
I look at life...

1:16:34.154 --> 1:16:37.201
if I don't have to
make my own decisions...

1:16:37.244 --> 1:16:38.985
then I can't make any mistakes.

1:16:40.465 --> 1:16:43.599
And if I can't make
any mistakes, then I win.

1:16:44.817 --> 1:16:48.559
And deep down we all
just want to be winners, right?

1:16:48.603 --> 1:16:52.389
