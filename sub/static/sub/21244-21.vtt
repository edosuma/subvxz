00:05.460 --> 00:07.040
So, I just
saw who's nominated

00:07.040 --> 00:08.960
for those yearbook award
thingies.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.080
The senior superlatives?

00:11.080 --> 00:13.460
KC, stop with the big words
that no one's ever heard of.

00:13.460 --> 00:16.750
Well, you clearly
aren't nominated
for Best Vocabulary.

00:16.750 --> 00:20.170
Uh, no! I am not nominated
for anything!

00:20.170 --> 00:23.330
I cannot believe I was
overlooked for Most Fashionable!

00:23.330 --> 00:26.830
Well, Marisa, people can't see
how well you dress in school

00:26.830 --> 00:28.920
if you're never in school.

00:30.540 --> 00:32.500
Think about this--
if you don't get
your grades up,

00:32.500 --> 00:35.460
maybe you could win
Most Fashionable next year.

00:35.460 --> 00:37.080
KC, come on,
this is really serious.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.710
I need this on my transcript

00:38.710 --> 00:40.880
if I want to get
into the Fashion Institute
of Technology.

00:40.880 --> 00:43.290
Being Most Fashionable
is like being

00:43.290 --> 00:47.330

of the Smarty Club
for Smarty People.

00:48.830 --> 00:50.880
Oh, look, look.
There is Amy-What's-Her-Face.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.460
She's the editor
of the yearbook.

00:52.460 --> 00:54.040
I'm gonna go give her
a piece of my mind.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.460
Marisa, or you know,
you could just

00:55.460 --> 00:57.620
step up your fashion game
and show her what you got.

00:57.620 --> 01:00.540
And it wouldn't hurt
to learn her name. It's Bishop.

01:00.540 --> 01:02.250
No, I'm pretty sure it's Amy.

01:02.250 --> 01:04.750
Yes. Amy Bishop.

As much as I'd love
to continue this conversation,

01:12.830 --> 01:14.960
I gotta go. Something bad
must be happening.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.620
It's really weird, 'cause you
always get Code Red meetings

01:16.620 --> 01:18.170
when I'm complaining
about something.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.670
All right, folks,
this is a big one.

02:18.670 --> 02:21.170
We just got intel
that enemy agents

02:21.170 --> 02:23.750
are hiding right here
in the DC Metro area

02:23.750 --> 02:26.290
pretending to be
ordinary citizens.

02:26.290 --> 02:29.040
That is despicable...

02:29.040 --> 02:32.080
except for when we do it.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.830
Actually, when you do it,
it's just comically incompetent.

02:36.380 --> 02:38.670
Judy, if you're not
gonna take this seriously,

02:38.670 --> 02:39.830
then you don't need
to be here.

02:39.830 --> 02:42.380
-Later, y'all!
-Sit down!

02:42.380 --> 02:44.380
So close!

02:44.380 --> 02:47.580
As I was saying,
these agents are running

02:47.580 --> 02:50.170
a covert weapons
distribution center.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.580
They supply laser guns
to enemy agencies worldwide.

02:53.580 --> 02:55.380
We need to shut them down
before The Alternate

02:55.380 --> 02:56.620
gets their hands
on these laser guns.

02:56.620 --> 02:57.880
Right, they're
still a threat,

02:57.880 --> 02:59.080
and the last thing we need

02:59.080 --> 03:00.580
is for them to have
a deep arsenal.

03:00.580 --> 03:01.540
All right, good talk.

03:01.540 --> 03:02.830
Let's go get 'em,
people!

03:02.830 --> 03:04.670
Slow down,
chicken legs!

03:04.670 --> 03:07.210
We don't even know
where they're located.

03:07.210 --> 03:09.460
If I were you, I probably
would've gotten that intel

03:09.460 --> 03:10.880
before calling
a Code Red meeting,

03:10.880 --> 03:12.580
but, you know, you're in charge.
You do you.

03:14.330 --> 03:16.710
What we do know
is that all these laser guns

03:16.710 --> 03:20.380
will generate
a substantial energy signature.

03:20.380 --> 03:22.620
Your scanners should pick it up
when you get close,

03:22.620 --> 03:25.540
so let's get out there
and start looking for it!

03:25.540 --> 03:27.250
Uh, one question.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.670
Yes, Craig, they'll
reimburse us for gas.

03:29.670 --> 03:31.670
I wasn't even gonna
ask that!

03:31.670 --> 03:33.500
And snacks!

03:33.500 --> 03:35.710
Okay, then I'm good.

03:37.460 --> 03:39.080
Okay, if anybody
finds anything,

03:39.080 --> 03:40.500
report back immediately.

03:40.500 --> 03:41.830
All right, let's go
get 'em, people.

03:45.670 --> 03:49.120
Sorry, I had to circle around
five times to find parking!

03:49.120 --> 03:52.830
Hey, uh, where is everyone?

03:52.830 --> 03:54.750
Am I the only agent
that takes

03:54.750 --> 03:56.380
these Code Red meetings
seriously?

03:59.290 --> 04:02.040
I'm upset, too, Agent Johnson!
They're in for

04:02.040 --> 04:04.540
a stern talking-to
when they finally get here!

04:04.540 --> 04:07.790
Ooh, get here early,
get the good chair.

04:11.620 --> 04:13.380
Four hours in this van,

04:13.380 --> 04:15.210
and not a trace
of the energy signature.

04:15.210 --> 04:18.920
[Judy] But I am getting a trace
of stale French fries
and funky sneakers.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.710
When's the last time
you washed this van,

04:20.710 --> 04:22.500
when Roosevelt
was president?

04:22.500 --> 04:24.750
[mutters]

04:24.750 --> 04:27.580
[Ernie]
You know, we haven't spent
this much time together

04:27.580 --> 04:29.500
since our trip
to Niagara Falls.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.960
[K.C.]
Ha! Yeah, I remember that.
You almost fell in.

04:31.960 --> 04:35.000
[Ernie]
I didn't almost fall in.
You pushed me!

04:35.000 --> 04:36.460
You told us he slipped!

04:36.460 --> 04:39.830
He did slip.
After I pushed him.

04:39.830 --> 04:42.420
-Stop the van!
-Why?

04:42.420 --> 04:44.170
Because there's
an ice cream truck,

04:44.170 --> 04:46.790
and I wanna buy everyone
a Strawberry Shortcake.

04:46.790 --> 04:48.120
-Really?
-No!

04:48.120 --> 04:51.170
We just drove past
the energy signature!

04:54.580 --> 04:56.540
But this can't be
the right location.

04:56.540 --> 04:58.790
We're on Old Stonehouse Road.

04:58.790 --> 05:00.920
It's practically around
the corner from our house.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.620
Wait a minute,
then that would mean--

05:02.620 --> 05:05.080
Enemy agents have been living
in our own neighborhood!

05:05.080 --> 05:07.380
Cross that house
off my trick-or-treat route.

05:07.380 --> 05:09.830
Okay, FYI, if you
can drive to the house,

05:09.830 --> 05:12.000
you're too old
to trick or treat.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.670
MARISA: Oh, hey, Amy,

05:39.670 --> 05:42.790
I didn't see you there.
Great outfit, huh?

05:48.790 --> 05:50.710
I didn't know Marisa
got the lead

05:50.710 --> 05:53.170
in Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat.

06:13.290 --> 06:14.500
[agent 1] Clear!

06:15.880 --> 06:16.880
[agent 2] Clear!

06:16.880 --> 06:17.880
Nobody's here.

06:17.880 --> 06:18.670
It's all clear!

06:18.670 --> 06:21.120
Yeah, and it's spotless!

06:21.120 --> 06:23.460
I need the name
of their cleaner.

06:23.460 --> 06:26.620
And their decorator.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.710
I cannot believe this.

06:28.710 --> 06:30.460
What, that we live
so close to enemy agents?

06:30.460 --> 06:33.290
No, this looks exactly
like a vase I made for Dad

06:33.290 --> 06:35.710
in the third grade,
but he told me it got broken.

06:35.710 --> 06:39.040
It did break.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.580
"With all my heart, KC."

06:43.040 --> 06:46.960
Or maybe I sold it
for a quarter
at a garage sale.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.710
They overpaid.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.790
Guys, are we sure
we have the right house?

06:51.790 --> 06:53.500
I mean, where are they
storing the weapons?

06:53.500 --> 06:54.920
Did you think
they'd be sitting

06:54.920 --> 06:56.880
in a candy dish
on the coffee table?

06:56.880 --> 06:59.710
Here's a thought:
Look around for 'em!

07:00.920 --> 07:03.210
Here's a thought:
Scan the walls!

07:06.920 --> 07:09.920
There's nothing in here.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.080
Or is there?

07:13.540 --> 07:14.920
Take cover!

07:16.880 --> 07:18.750
Ready, agents? Fire!

07:23.420 --> 07:24.830
Get out here!

07:24.830 --> 07:28.750

07:28.750 --> 07:30.540
Put your hands
where we can see them.

07:30.540 --> 07:32.380
Sure.

07:33.790 --> 07:35.710
As soon as we're done
eliminating you!

07:40.920 --> 07:43.790
Ah, we've always talked
about redecorating
the living room.

07:43.790 --> 07:46.500
Well, no time
like the present!

07:46.500 --> 07:48.500
I actually love
your pillows.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.920
Thank you so much!

07:49.920 --> 07:51.790
Just try not to get
any blood on them.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.330
Yeah, so if you don't mind
dying outside,

07:55.330 --> 07:56.420
that would be great.

07:57.920 --> 07:58.880
All right, you guys
are surrounded.

07:58.880 --> 07:59.920
Drop your weapons.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.000
Eat laser fire!

08:49.250 --> 08:50.750
[both shriek]

08:52.710 --> 08:55.750
I lied. Those pillows
are hideous.

09:00.710 --> 09:03.920
That's right, kiss
your little weapon-running
operation goodbye,

09:03.920 --> 09:05.540
because we just
shut you down!

09:05.540 --> 09:07.250
That's right! Ha-ha!

09:07.250 --> 09:12.420
Mom, Dad, what's for dinner,
because I am absolutely-- aah!

09:12.420 --> 09:14.460
Hands where we
can see them.

09:14.460 --> 09:18.290
KC? KC Cooper?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.920
My parents!
What have you done to them?!

09:28.920 --> 09:31.790
We have to spell it out for you?
We whupped their butts!

09:31.790 --> 09:34.500
Don't worry,
they'll be fine.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.920
KC, would you please tell me
what's going on!

09:36.920 --> 09:41.790
KC? Uh, I think you have me
confused for somebody else.

09:41.790 --> 09:45.290
I'm not KC, I'm, uh,
I'm her cousin Cassandra.

09:45.290 --> 09:47.880
Really?

09:49.250 --> 09:50.710
Oh, yeah, you're KC Cooper.

09:50.710 --> 09:53.120
Okay, yes.
Yes, I am KC,

09:53.120 --> 09:55.120
and I know this looks
a little weird,

09:55.120 --> 09:57.040
but everything
will be just fine.

09:57.040 --> 10:01.120
Just fine? My parents
are unconscious,

10:01.120 --> 10:02.920
my-- my house is trashed,

10:02.920 --> 10:05.120
and some rando girl
from my school

10:05.120 --> 10:07.670
is pointing a weapon at me,
so you wanna like take a second

10:07.670 --> 10:09.920
and let me know how everything
is gonna be just fine?

10:09.920 --> 10:12.330
It'll be fine because--

10:12.330 --> 10:14.380
Because you're not gonna
remember any of this.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.380
[spritz]

10:16.710 --> 10:19.210
Oh, all right.
So, what are we thinking?

10:19.210 --> 10:21.080
Is Amy working
with her parents?

10:21.080 --> 10:22.880
Oh, please.
Come on, guys, seriously?

10:22.880 --> 10:24.460
Whoever heard
of a teenaged spy?

10:26.290 --> 10:28.920
Okay, I see your point.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.040
But seriously, what's
gonna happen to Amy?

10:32.040 --> 10:33.830
Well, she'll be
taken care of.

10:33.830 --> 10:36.210
"Taken care of"
like we'll find her
a nice new home,

10:36.210 --> 10:39.420
or "taken care of"
like we'll find her
a nice new prison cell?

10:39.420 --> 10:41.880
The first one.
Probably.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.040
No, really, guys,
what's the plan?

10:45.040 --> 10:46.750
I mean, assuming
she's innocent,

10:46.750 --> 10:49.040
what are we gonna do,
rip her away from her parents?

10:49.040 --> 10:50.080
That's kind of cruel.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.500
Honey, that's the job.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.080
They're enemy spies.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.670
Yeah, but who's gonna take
her picture at prom

10:55.670 --> 10:58.460
or who's gonna drive her
to college on the first day?

10:58.460 --> 11:00.830
Will she even be able
to go to college?

11:00.830 --> 11:03.000
I don't wanna ruin her life.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.920
She should have
the same opportunity

11:04.920 --> 11:08.210
to ruin her life
that I have.

11:08.210 --> 11:10.580
KC, relax. We do this
to people all the time.

11:10.580 --> 11:12.290
Yeah, but not
people I know.

11:12.290 --> 11:14.500
Oh, now you suddenly
growing a conscience?

11:14.500 --> 11:17.960
You put more people
in the hospital
than trichinosis.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.500
Guys, I have know this girl
since eighth grade.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.170
She's not
particularly friendly,

11:22.170 --> 11:24.960
but I don't want to ruin
her life if she's innocent.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.380
Well, we're gonna find out
how innocent she is soon enough.

11:27.380 --> 11:29.750
Let's take 'em all
to Headquarters for questioning.

11:29.750 --> 11:30.750
Yep.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.670
Marisa, we need to talk
about your outfit.

12:03.670 --> 12:06.040
Oh, I guess
the fashion buzz has begun!

12:06.040 --> 12:08.080
What do you want
to tell me, Ms. Schaffer,

12:08.080 --> 12:10.040
that my outfit is fabulous,
totally unique,

12:10.040 --> 12:12.210
the height of style?

12:12.210 --> 12:15.920
No, that it is totally
inappropriate for school.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.580
You're going
to the principal's office.

12:17.580 --> 12:19.460
Well, if I don't win
Most Fashionable,

12:19.460 --> 12:21.880
I'm a shoo-in for Most Trips
to the Principal's Office.

12:21.880 --> 12:22.960
Mm-hmm.

12:34.460 --> 12:37.880
Excellent work,
Coopers! [claps]

12:37.880 --> 12:40.830
We have dealt our enemies'
weapon supply chain
a major blow.

12:40.830 --> 12:43.040
Yeah, we managed
to squash one cockroach,

12:43.040 --> 12:45.250
but there's a whole nest
waiting to take its place.

12:45.250 --> 12:46.420
Dad's right.

12:46.420 --> 12:48.120
Why should we just settle
for slowing them down

12:48.120 --> 12:49.620
when we can take 'em out
altogether?

12:49.620 --> 12:51.210
If these guys supply
laser weapons

12:51.210 --> 12:53.250
to every enemy agency
in the world,

12:53.250 --> 12:56.120
then that means they must have
some type of distribution list

12:56.120 --> 12:57.880
with names and addresses.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.790
If we can get our hands
on that list, then...

12:59.790 --> 13:01.790
We could finally
end the spy war!

13:01.790 --> 13:03.080
I like the way
you're thinking.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.540
Okay, hey, son!

13:04.540 --> 13:07.250
Did you find any intel
on the Bishops' computer?

13:07.250 --> 13:09.620
Nope, nothing
but homework assignments,

13:09.620 --> 13:11.620
links for a bunch
of coupon websites,

13:11.620 --> 13:14.540
and their browsing history
reveals somebody in this house

13:14.540 --> 13:16.540
is really into kitten videos.

13:16.540 --> 13:19.210
Here's one where a kitten
can't stop sneezing.

13:19.210 --> 13:21.670
It's just adorable! Look.

13:21.670 --> 13:26.080
Ahem! We have more important
things to do right now, Ernie.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.670
Ahem, that's right.

13:28.670 --> 13:31.120
We're gonna jot down
the name of those coupon sites.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.210
Nothing wrong with hunting
for some bargains

13:33.210 --> 13:35.170
while you're hunting
for clues.

13:35.170 --> 13:37.500
Of course there's
nothing on the computer!

13:37.500 --> 13:40.290
I mean, if you're arming
a worldwide network
of secret agents,

13:40.290 --> 13:42.040
you don't store the guns

13:42.040 --> 13:44.290
and the distribution list
in the same place.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.880
Well then, Amy's parents
will just have to lead us to it.

13:46.880 --> 13:50.420
Sure, because enemy agents
love helping us
with our investigations.

13:50.420 --> 13:53.250
They will if you do it
the smart way.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.710
What's on your mind, KC?

13:54.710 --> 13:56.540
Okay, here's
what I'm thinking.

13:56.540 --> 13:58.170
We should memory spray
the parents, okay,

13:58.170 --> 13:59.500
then we clean this place up

13:59.500 --> 14:02.170
and make it look exactly
the way it was...

14:02.170 --> 14:03.790
except for the vase.

14:03.790 --> 14:06.120
This will be coming home
with us.

14:09.460 --> 14:11.500
Then, while we're
cleaning up,

14:11.500 --> 14:14.500
we'll also plant
listening devices.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.750
That idea actually sounds
pretty cool.

14:16.750 --> 14:19.580
No, that idea actually sounds
pretty stupid.

14:21.330 --> 14:23.540
These people
are trained spies, KC.

14:23.540 --> 14:25.380
If they wake up
with a foggy memory,

14:25.380 --> 14:27.380
the first thing they'll suspect

14:27.380 --> 14:29.580
is that they've been
memory sprayed.

14:29.580 --> 14:33.500
Then they'll scour the house
for listening devices,

14:33.500 --> 14:36.420
they'll know
we're on to them,

14:36.420 --> 14:38.540
and they'll disappear
with the weapons supply

14:38.540 --> 14:40.290
and the distribution list,

14:40.290 --> 14:42.080
and we'll be right back
where we started.

14:42.080 --> 14:45.540
Like I said,
stupid idea.

14:45.540 --> 14:49.250
Okay, good point,
although you could've made it

14:49.250 --> 14:51.580
without being
so mean about it.

14:53.710 --> 14:55.790
Okay, instead
of bugging their house,

14:55.790 --> 14:57.210
why don't we send
someone in

14:57.210 --> 14:58.750
to win their trust
and get that intel?

14:58.750 --> 15:01.170
If we play the long game,
we get the enemy list

15:01.170 --> 15:03.330
and round them up
all at once.

15:03.330 --> 15:05.250
Okay. Okay.
We're doing this.

15:05.250 --> 15:06.210
Start the cleanup!

15:06.210 --> 15:07.670
We're gonna make
this place

15:07.670 --> 15:09.670
look like we were
never here.

15:09.670 --> 15:11.380
All right, well,
how does this work?

15:11.380 --> 15:13.250
So now at least
we memory-sprayed her,

15:13.250 --> 15:14.670
so my cover
hasn't been blown.

15:14.670 --> 15:17.040
Amy will have no idea
that I'm a spy.

15:17.040 --> 15:19.880
Which we can use
to our advantage.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.540
Hey, Dad, seriously,
I am not spying on Amy.

15:26.540 --> 15:28.620
But it makes
perfect sense!

15:28.620 --> 15:30.290
You already have
a relationship.

15:30.290 --> 15:32.250
Just buddy up to her,
get into her house,

15:32.250 --> 15:34.620
and find that weapons
distribution list!

15:34.620 --> 15:35.960
Familiar
with the plan, Dad.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.210
Kind of came up
with the plan.

15:37.210 --> 15:40.210
Don't understand
why I have to be the one
to carry it out.

15:40.210 --> 15:43.080
[chuckles] Well, who else
is gonna do it?

15:43.080 --> 15:45.330
Ernie? Step one:
talk to a girl.

15:45.330 --> 15:46.380
Oops, he blew it already!

15:48.250 --> 15:49.750
KC, this mission is
too important

15:49.750 --> 15:51.330
to be trusted
to anyone else.

15:51.330 --> 15:53.290
I know, but, look,
it's one thing

15:53.290 --> 15:54.790
to fly to Monrovia
and pretend to be

15:54.790 --> 15:57.420
an international pop star
or construction worker,

15:57.420 --> 15:59.250
because at the end of the day
I get to go home

15:59.250 --> 16:01.380
and have a regular life
and go to school.

16:01.380 --> 16:04.250
Except now I get to sit
next to the innocent girl

16:04.250 --> 16:05.710
whose life I'm ruining.

16:05.710 --> 16:07.750
Wait, wait, we don't know
Amy is innocent.

16:07.750 --> 16:09.330
We know she's not a spy!

16:09.330 --> 16:10.500
Look, here's
what I do know, okay?

16:10.500 --> 16:11.880
She's got a best friend
named Susie,

16:11.880 --> 16:13.380
she gets A's in Spanish,

16:13.380 --> 16:15.120
and walks around everywhere
with headphones on.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.830
And what do people
say about you?

16:16.830 --> 16:19.670
She has a best friend
named Marisa,
she's an A student,

16:19.670 --> 16:22.080
and she couldn't
get a boyfriend
to save her life!

16:23.290 --> 16:25.710
Again, could've
made your point

16:25.710 --> 16:28.670
without being
so mean about it.

16:28.670 --> 16:32.120
Listen, honey, if we can get
that weapons distribution list,

16:32.120 --> 16:34.330
we could take down
every enemy spy network

16:34.330 --> 16:36.920
in the country--
maybe even the world!

16:36.920 --> 16:38.290
Countless lives
could be saved!

16:38.290 --> 16:40.170
I know, I know,
I just don't understand

16:40.170 --> 16:42.120
why Ernie can't be
the one to be close to her.

16:42.120 --> 16:46.040
So, Dad, is it normal
if a girl gives me her number,

16:46.040 --> 16:48.170
and when I try it
I find out the number

16:48.170 --> 16:50.830
belongs to a 78-year-old widow
in Sacramento?

16:54.290 --> 16:56.250
I'll do it.

17:00.210 --> 17:02.080
Well, there's Amy.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.420
All right,
codename Domino.

17:04.420 --> 17:05.620
Why Domino?

17:05.620 --> 17:07.170
Because when she falls,

17:07.170 --> 17:09.380
she'll bring the rest
down with her.

17:10.380 --> 17:12.000
Reminds me of
my codename for you--

17:12.000 --> 17:14.170
Solitaire, 'cause no one
wants to play with you.

17:14.170 --> 17:17.330
All right,
so all I gotta do
is go say hi to her

17:17.330 --> 17:19.170
and just let
the friendship unfold.

17:19.170 --> 17:20.830
It's not like I haven't
done this before.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.540
Yeah, just say
what you said to Marisa.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.210
That seems
to have worked out.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.500
Ernie, we were children.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.500
Okay, I don't think
"Circle, circle, dot, dot,

17:27.500 --> 17:30.790
now you got the cootie shot,"
is gonna work in this situation.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.960
Hey, ladies!

17:34.960 --> 17:36.670
Do you mind, KC?

17:36.670 --> 17:38.750
We're actually
in the middle
of a conversation.

17:38.750 --> 17:41.080
Oh, what are we talking about?
Boys? Homework?

17:41.080 --> 17:42.500
I was just
consoling Susie.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.460
Her goldfish died
last night.

17:44.460 --> 17:46.580
Oh, I'm so sorry about that.

17:46.580 --> 17:48.540
Well, I mean, if it makes
you feel any better,

17:48.540 --> 17:50.830
goldfish don't really have
the cognitive thinking powers

17:50.830 --> 17:52.540
to recognize
a complex relationship,

17:52.540 --> 17:53.830
plus, you know,
he dead now!

17:56.580 --> 17:59.460
Was there a point
to you coming over here
and interrupting

17:59.460 --> 18:02.120
other than regaling
us with your fish facts?

18:02.120 --> 18:05.750
Uh, yeah, actually,
I was thinking maybe we
could hang out sometime,

18:05.750 --> 18:07.250
you know,
for old times' sake.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.460
What old times?

18:08.460 --> 18:10.670
We're not friends.

18:10.670 --> 18:12.540
Of course, but like,

18:12.540 --> 18:16.000
what better time
to make old times than now?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.380
Dude, we're graduating
in a few months.

18:18.380 --> 18:20.620
If you really wanted
to get to know me,

18:20.620 --> 18:23.170
where were you when I first
moved here in the eighth grade

18:23.170 --> 18:24.620
and everybody said
I had cooties?

18:24.620 --> 18:26.620
Were you there
to give me a cootie shot?

18:26.620 --> 18:28.580
No. No, you weren't.

18:28.580 --> 18:31.580
No? I mean, "Circle, circle,
dot, dot--"

18:31.580 --> 18:32.790
Too late!

18:36.620 --> 18:38.420
What was that about?

18:38.420 --> 18:40.540
Better question,
what is this about?

18:43.040 --> 18:44.420
It's tight, right?

18:44.420 --> 18:46.080
It's definitely tight,

18:46.080 --> 18:48.620
so tight I'm surprised
you can breathe.

18:48.620 --> 18:50.290
No, I can breathe, KC.

18:50.290 --> 18:53.880
It's the yawning
and the sneezing
that are the problems.

18:55.250 --> 18:58.250
But that is
the price you pay
to be the most...

18:58.250 --> 19:00.620
[loudly] fashionable person
in school!

19:01.960 --> 19:05.120
...which clearly I am!

19:06.830 --> 19:08.290
Now, if you'll excuse me,

19:08.290 --> 19:10.830
I have to go flaunt
this outside.

19:10.830 --> 19:13.460
[snapping] Roger! George!

19:22.380 --> 19:23.540
Uh, vote for me.

19:23.540 --> 19:24.960
Vote for me.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.750
Achoo! Ow! Ow! Ow!

19:28.880 --> 19:30.670
[scoffs] This is
so frustrating.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.460
[scoffs] I know.

19:32.460 --> 19:36.250
I have worn
haute couture outfits
every day to school this week,

19:36.250 --> 19:38.040
and still there is
no write-in campaign

19:38.040 --> 19:40.000
to have me win
most fashionable!

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I mean, where is
the groundswell of support

19:42.000 --> 19:45.710
that this ensemble deserves!

19:45.710 --> 19:49.080
The only thing that ensemble
deserves is a burial at sea.

19:51.330 --> 19:53.120
Look, I'm talking about Amy.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.920
How am I supposed
to become her best friend

19:54.920 --> 19:56.580
when she already has
a best friend?

19:56.580 --> 19:57.920
You can't have
two best friends!

19:57.920 --> 20:00.040
It literally contradicts
the meaning of "best"!

20:01.250 --> 20:02.500
Well, I mean,
I hate to say this,

20:02.500 --> 20:05.290
but you know who'd
be really good at this?

20:05.290 --> 20:06.670
-Brady.
-Brady?

20:06.670 --> 20:08.080
I mean, yeah.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.580
He tricked me
into liking him

20:09.580 --> 20:11.000
just to get
closer to you,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.290
kind of like how you
have to trick Amy

20:13.290 --> 20:15.710
into liking you
to get close to her family.

20:15.710 --> 20:19.540
Yeah, well the only difference
is you didn't know Brady before,

20:19.540 --> 20:21.920
and he didn't really care
who he hurt in the process.

20:21.920 --> 20:25.040
[sighs] This whole thing
is just so icky!

20:25.040 --> 20:27.880
I mean, icky or not,
he turned me against you.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.580
I mean, we were already
in a huge fight,

20:29.580 --> 20:32.620
but he totally took advantage
of the situation.

20:32.620 --> 20:35.500
Okay, so how am I supposed
to get Amy and Susie
in a big fight?

20:35.500 --> 20:38.330
Well, I mean, I don't know,
I haven't really had time
to think this through,

20:38.330 --> 20:42.170
but off the top of my head
what if, I don't know, you, say,

20:42.170 --> 20:44.540
have Ernie hack
into Amy's phone,

20:44.540 --> 20:45.710
go through her texts,

20:45.710 --> 20:47.120
find out her deepest,
darkest secret

20:47.120 --> 20:48.710
that only her best friend
would know,

20:48.710 --> 20:50.000
spread that secret
around school,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.290
and then Amy
would have no choice

20:51.290 --> 20:52.670
but to assume Susie
spilled the secret,

20:52.670 --> 20:54.040
causing her to call off
the friendship,

20:54.040 --> 20:55.670
and then boom, you swoop in.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.920
I cannot believe
that I'm gonna say this,

20:58.920 --> 21:00.580
but that is
a really good idea.

21:00.580 --> 21:04.080
Except now, instead of
ruining one life that I know,

21:04.080 --> 21:05.540
I will be ruining two.

21:05.540 --> 21:07.710
So this just went
from icky to ickier.

21:19.380 --> 21:22.790
Hey, Amy, look,
I don't care what Susie says,

21:22.790 --> 21:25.710
I do not believe her.

21:25.710 --> 21:27.330
What are you talking about?

21:27.330 --> 21:30.670
Oh! Oh, you don't know?

21:30.670 --> 21:33.670
Yeah, Susie, she's
going around school

21:33.670 --> 21:35.750
and she's telling people
that the reason

21:35.750 --> 21:37.500
Rick broke up with you

21:37.500 --> 21:40.500
is because you
gave him head lice.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.710
[chuckles]

21:42.710 --> 21:43.960
And then you...

21:43.960 --> 21:47.710
kissed his brother
to get even with him.

21:47.710 --> 21:48.670
She said that?

21:48.670 --> 21:49.960
Yeah.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.500
I hate you!

22:02.170 --> 22:04.500
Hey, Amy, are you okay?

22:04.500 --> 22:06.620
No, I'm not okay!

22:06.620 --> 22:08.250
Okay, what's wrong?

22:08.250 --> 22:09.880
You ever have a friend
you thought you could trust

22:09.880 --> 22:11.500
and then you find out
you totally couldn't?

22:11.500 --> 22:14.620
Well, sounds like you could
use someone to talk to.

22:14.620 --> 22:17.620
Hey, um, how about
we go get some fresh air

22:17.620 --> 22:19.040
and you can tell me
all about it?

22:19.040 --> 22:21.750
Thanks for being
so nice, KC.

22:21.750 --> 22:23.620
Yeah, no problem.
Come on.

22:23.620 --> 22:24.960
And also, I mean,
if you're up to it,

22:24.960 --> 22:26.620
we can watch those cute
little kitten videos.

22:26.620 --> 22:28.920
I found this one
where this one kid
can't stop sneezing.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.710
I love that one!

22:37.790 --> 22:39.040
[woman]
Rob, your name's on TV!
