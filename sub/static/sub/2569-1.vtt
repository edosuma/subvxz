00:14.837 --> 00:16.103
Agh!

00:51.706 --> 00:53.373
Whoo!

00:56.678 --> 00:58.678
Wahoo!

01:04.885 --> 01:08.855
â™ª Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

01:17.932 --> 01:19.933
Party time!

01:27.909 --> 01:30.744
RJ... cannonball!

01:35.416 --> 01:36.917
Whoa.

01:40.621 --> 01:42.022
Whoa! RJ!

01:42.024 --> 01:45.492
Hah! That's what I call
some serious splash!

01:45.494 --> 01:47.160
You got me all wet.

01:47.162 --> 01:49.229
Hey, Ribbit, go for it!

01:49.231 --> 01:51.364
Last one in's a rotten egg.

01:51.366 --> 01:55.368
Oh, that's a disgusting idea.
Hah-hah.

01:55.370 --> 01:57.671
<i>- You can do it.
- Show us how it's done.</i>

01:57.673 --> 01:59.873
Come on, Ribbit!
Do it!

01:59.875 --> 02:02.175
Quit joking around!
Come on in!

02:02.177 --> 02:04.010
Let's get this party started.

02:04.012 --> 02:07.414
Go for it, Ribbit.
I'll even give you a head start.

02:07.416 --> 02:10.083
You won't drown, you're a frog.

02:10.085 --> 02:12.619
You spend half your life
breathing underwater.

02:12.621 --> 02:14.321
Well, you know what they say.

02:14.323 --> 02:16.490
Change is good for the soul.
Hah-hah.

02:16.492 --> 02:19.259
Oh, yeah, that's right!

02:19.261 --> 02:21.294
Ribbit doesn't like to swim.

02:21.296 --> 02:22.863
He doesn't even like water.

02:22.865 --> 02:26.700
Me? Afraid of the water?
I don't think so.

02:26.702 --> 02:28.001
Whatever.

02:28.003 --> 02:32.839
A frog that doesn't like water?
Hah-hah... what a dork!

02:32.841 --> 02:34.241
Come on, Ribbit!

02:34.243 --> 02:37.210
Yeah!

02:37.212 --> 02:40.680
Do it! Do it!

02:42.817 --> 02:45.018
Agh!

02:47.955 --> 02:51.892
Oh, hah-hah, hey!
The water's great!

02:51.894 --> 02:53.426
Wahoo!

03:00.868 --> 03:03.503
Dude, think she'll make it?

03:03.505 --> 03:06.139
Yo, she sure shredded
it last time.

03:06.141 --> 03:07.641
Most excellent.

03:07.643 --> 03:10.277
Crash and burn for five, dude.

03:11.646 --> 03:14.848
Whoa, oh... oh, boy!

03:18.419 --> 03:20.086
Agh!

03:20.088 --> 03:22.656
Ow... ow... ugh!

03:25.693 --> 03:29.296
They say that landing
is the hardest part.

03:29.298 --> 03:30.997
Yeah!

03:30.999 --> 03:34.301
That's what I call making an entrance!
Go, Sandy!

03:34.303 --> 03:35.435
Are you okay?

03:35.437 --> 03:36.903
Of course, I am.

03:36.905 --> 03:41.174
Hey, guys!
Gus, how's the fly fishing?

03:44.946 --> 03:47.881
Pretty tasty today,
you want some?

03:47.883 --> 03:49.916
No, I already had my lunch.

03:49.918 --> 03:51.685
Thank you for asking, though.

03:51.687 --> 03:53.286
Oh, hey, Casey, how's your mom?

03:55.624 --> 04:00.226
Big Berry... did you finally
get that love song going?

04:02.563 --> 04:06.433
Oh, beautiful.

04:06.435 --> 04:11.438
Hey, Cecile, you are looking
good, girlfriend.

04:11.440 --> 04:14.040
Has somebody been cleaning
your feathers?

04:14.042 --> 04:16.009
You see?

04:16.011 --> 04:18.712
Hey, Ribbit, doesn't
Cecile look sharp?

04:18.714 --> 04:20.981
Ribbit? Ribbit?

04:21.416 --> 04:23.617
Hey, Ribbit, wait up!

04:23.919 --> 04:25.919
Hey, Ribbit,
where are you going?

04:25.921 --> 04:27.387
How was the party at the pond?

04:27.389 --> 04:30.957
Why are you leaving?
Ribbit, will you stop already?

04:31.059 --> 04:33.493
What is bugging you?

04:33.495 --> 04:35.428
Sandy, just look at me.

04:35.430 --> 04:37.063
Yeah...

04:37.065 --> 04:39.366
I'm not like
all the other frogs.

04:39.368 --> 04:40.668
I don't really fit in.

04:40.670 --> 04:44.070
I look so different from them and
I feel like I just don't belong.

04:44.072 --> 04:46.673
And then to top it off,
I'm poisonous.

04:46.675 --> 04:48.108
I... I'm a poison tree frog.

04:48.110 --> 04:50.143
I mean, can it get
any better than that?

04:50.145 --> 04:54.514
Ribbit, so what? Who cares
that you're a poison tree frog?

04:54.516 --> 04:57.918
Who cares? I care!
That's who cares.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.520
I'm the only poisonous frog
at the pond.

05:00.522 --> 05:03.790
Come on, Ribbit.
Come back with me.

05:03.792 --> 05:06.460
The pond is for animals
who like water.

05:06.462 --> 05:09.529
I don't like water.
How's that for irony?

05:09.531 --> 05:11.231
A frog who hates water.

05:11.233 --> 05:14.534
That's like a caterpillar
who hates leaves.

05:14.536 --> 05:17.103
Huh?

05:17.105 --> 05:18.672
Where are you going?

05:18.674 --> 05:20.206
To the tree house.

05:28.783 --> 05:32.719
Man, this place
always creeps me out.

05:32.721 --> 05:35.622
I really don't understand why
you like it here so much.

05:35.624 --> 05:38.725
Must be a guy thing.

05:48.969 --> 05:50.804
Huh...

05:54.508 --> 05:55.909
You read this stuff?

05:55.911 --> 05:59.813
Of course, are you kidding?
Come look at this, Sandy.

05:59.815 --> 06:03.317
All these animals...
they have a place.

06:03.319 --> 06:05.852
They... they have a purpose.

06:05.854 --> 06:08.688
A purpose?
That's what you want?

06:08.690 --> 06:11.958
Labels, Ribbit...
small frog that hates water.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.027
And you know what else?
I hate jumping.

06:14.029 --> 06:17.997
A frog who hates water
and jumping.

06:20.769 --> 06:23.837
So, you're a bit different.
So what?

06:23.839 --> 06:26.873
Come on, doesn't it seem
just a little weird to you?

06:26.875 --> 06:28.842
Even my name is weird.

06:28.844 --> 06:31.544
Ribbit... who names
their kid Ribbit?

06:31.546 --> 06:33.780
Well, what name do you want?

06:34.582 --> 06:37.283
Hm... Norman.

06:37.285 --> 06:40.720
There's a good name.
I want to be called Norman.

06:40.722 --> 06:42.355
Ribbit...

06:42.357 --> 06:44.023
The name is Norman.

06:44.025 --> 06:45.859
Hah...

06:45.861 --> 06:48.027
At least you have
other frogs around you.

06:48.029 --> 06:50.964
Me, the only squirrel I see...

06:50.966 --> 06:52.832
is when I wash my face
in the water.

06:52.834 --> 06:55.935
Wow... I never thought
about it.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.670
But still, look at you.

06:57.672 --> 06:59.405
I mean, you're so popular.

06:59.407 --> 07:02.609
Everyone cracks up when you pull
that crash landing stunt.

07:02.611 --> 07:04.377
You want to know a secret?

07:04.379 --> 07:05.779
It's not a stunt.

07:05.781 --> 07:08.114
I'm just really bad at landing.

07:08.116 --> 07:10.750
But I cover it up, because
I don't want to be laughed at.

07:10.752 --> 07:15.021
Sandy, I never guessed.
I mean, you fly so great!

07:15.023 --> 07:16.923
How come you don't know
how to land?

07:16.925 --> 07:19.426
Oh, well, when I was little...

07:19.428 --> 07:22.195
my mom was...
teaching me how to fly.

07:22.197 --> 07:25.465
But then like a lot of parents,
she just kind of got busy...

07:25.467 --> 07:28.401
and we never quite
got around to it.

07:28.403 --> 07:30.904
I guess we all have things
about ourselves...

07:30.906 --> 07:32.572
we wish we could change.

07:32.574 --> 07:37.210
I guess... but you can't let it
take over your life.

07:37.212 --> 07:38.678
Someday you'll figure it out.

07:38.680 --> 07:42.515
But, in the meantime, you just
gotta go with the flow.

07:42.517 --> 07:45.552
Yeah, but don't you want
to know why you're here?

07:45.554 --> 07:47.554
I mean, what are we here for?

07:47.556 --> 07:50.056
Sure, I would love
to know that.

07:50.058 --> 07:53.293
But I believe that things happen
when they're supposed to happen.

07:53.295 --> 07:55.762
But wouldn't it be great
to have the answers now?

07:55.764 --> 07:57.397
Answers to what?

07:57.399 --> 07:58.765
Everything!

07:58.767 --> 08:00.099
What are we here for?

08:00.101 --> 08:02.168
Why am I a poisonous frog?

08:02.170 --> 08:04.137
Why am I so different
from the others?

08:04.139 --> 08:07.807
Why do we eat leaves,
or bugs or fish?

08:07.809 --> 08:11.878
Fish! Yuck.
Oh, that is so gross.

08:11.880 --> 08:16.082
You want to eat a fish?

08:16.084 --> 08:18.051
Agh... no!

08:18.053 --> 08:20.353
I don't want to eat a fish.

08:23.091 --> 08:26.893
Look, Sandy... you know
you're my best friend...

08:26.895 --> 08:29.829
and I love you to death.

08:29.831 --> 08:32.899
But... I kind of need
some time alone.

08:32.900 --> 08:36.769
Oh... um, okay.

08:36.770 --> 08:38.837
Sure.

09:27.656 --> 09:32.258
<i>The world stood in
awe today as world famous zoologist...</i>

09:32.260 --> 09:38.198
Henry Jones discovered a new and
truly unique species of frog.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.367
<i>ANNOUNCER  As Jones
received his Nobel Prize...</i>

09:41.369 --> 09:45.171
<i>massive crowds gathered outside
hoping to catch a glimpse...</i>

09:45.173 --> 09:48.341
<i>of this truly one-of-a-kind
amphibian.</i>

09:48.343 --> 09:52.979
<i>Fame and fortune await
for this amazing little fellow.</i>

09:52.981 --> 09:57.116
<i>Who knows what great adventures
lie ahead for him?</i>

10:04.558 --> 10:07.026
Luciano, you think
there are ghosts in here?

10:07.028 --> 10:09.662
Marcella, are you trying
to scare me?

10:09.664 --> 10:14.067
Guys, we shouldn't be here.
Mom is gonna get really angry.

10:14.069 --> 10:16.135
Don't be a baby, Rafa.

10:16.137 --> 10:19.238
How are you gonna be a hunter, if you
keep running back to Mommy all the time?

10:30.719 --> 10:34.454
Hey, smell that? Cool.

10:58.445 --> 10:59.445
What is it?

10:59.447 --> 11:02.915
Nothing, I thought
I smelled something.

11:02.917 --> 11:08.454
Only thing I smell is you.
Pee-yew! Heh-heh.

11:08.456 --> 11:10.289
Let's check out the other side.

11:19.700 --> 11:21.567
Phew.

11:43.957 --> 11:47.326
Agh! Agh!

11:52.433 --> 11:54.834
Look at all the pretty colors.

11:54.836 --> 11:59.305
Don't eat that. Mom said anything with
bright colors is poisonous, remember?

11:59.307 --> 12:03.776
We don't have to eat it,
we can just hunt it.

12:03.778 --> 12:05.178
Go on, go get it.

12:05.180 --> 12:07.046
You go get it. You go get it.

12:07.048 --> 12:08.948
I told you first. Did not.

12:08.950 --> 12:10.716
Did, too. Did not.

12:10.718 --> 12:13.286
Come here, little froggy.

12:13.288 --> 12:18.825
Get him, Rafa,
don't let him get away!

12:56.397 --> 12:58.197
Uh-oh.

13:26.160 --> 13:28.628
Phew! That was close.

13:49.784 --> 13:51.784
Oh, no... Ribbit!

14:19.446 --> 14:21.180
Whoa.

14:39.399 --> 14:42.168
Come on, Rafa! Jump!

14:42.170 --> 14:44.737
You can do it!
Jump, Rafa! Jump!

14:49.643 --> 14:51.277
Hang in there, Rafa!

14:51.279 --> 14:53.813
Pull, Rafa! Pull yourself up!

15:08.729 --> 15:09.795
Ooh...

15:24.711 --> 15:27.647
That was... so cool!

15:27.649 --> 15:30.516
Are you nuts?
We could have been killed!

15:30.518 --> 15:34.020
Momma's gonna be so angry.

15:34.022 --> 15:35.354
No!

15:35.356 --> 15:39.825
I think we ought to get out
of here, guys.

15:39.827 --> 15:45.298
Rafa, I think we need to talk about
what we're gonna tell Momma. Okay?

15:55.242 --> 16:00.846
Ribbit? Ribbit?
Ribbit, where are you?

16:00.848 --> 16:03.049
Ribbit!

16:16.296 --> 16:18.964
Hey, what happened?

16:18.966 --> 16:24.637
The plane, the plane...
it's all gone. It's all gone.

16:24.639 --> 16:28.574
Who cares, Ribbit? What's important
is that you're all right.

16:28.576 --> 16:32.078
All right? I just lost
the one thing...

16:32.080 --> 16:36.315
the one thing that keeps me
sane, that makes me happy.

16:36.317 --> 16:38.284
The one thing keeping me here.

16:38.286 --> 16:43.589
Ribbit, you don't need a bunch of pictures
to tell you what you should be or do.

16:43.591 --> 16:47.526
So what do I do now?
It's all gone.

16:47.528 --> 16:50.930
I've got nothing, nothing.

16:59.773 --> 17:02.575
Grrr... that's it!
I'm out of here!

17:02.577 --> 17:04.343
You're leaving? To where?

17:04.345 --> 17:07.113
I don't know and I don't care.

17:07.115 --> 17:09.281
Anywhere's gotta be better
than here.

17:09.282 --> 17:12.017
Ribbit.

17:13.854 --> 17:19.090
Sandy, if I stay here,
I'm gonna go crazy.

17:19.093 --> 17:21.761
I just gotta get out of here.

17:28.668 --> 17:31.604
You're running away?
You're really running away.

17:31.606 --> 17:33.773
Well, that's great, just great!

17:33.775 --> 17:36.742
I'm not running away.
I'm escaping.

17:36.744 --> 17:39.412
Well, I'm not going
to come look for you, you know!

17:39.414 --> 17:42.882
And there could be bad things
out there!

17:42.884 --> 17:44.984
Well, nothing could be
as bad as staying here.

17:44.986 --> 17:47.486
But you could get hurt, eaten.

17:47.488 --> 17:51.190
I'm poisonous, remember?
Nothing to worry about.

17:51.192 --> 17:53.025
What can go wrong?

17:53.027 --> 17:58.831
Grrr... fine, just go!
Leave! I don't care anymore.

17:58.833 --> 18:02.001
Just go! Argh!

18:06.106 --> 18:07.239
Huh.

18:23.323 --> 18:26.759
Phew! I'm exhausted.

18:26.761 --> 18:29.462
I've been going for hours.

18:34.134 --> 18:39.071
Wow... I wonder where I am.

19:20.447 --> 19:23.849
Om... Wha...

19:23.851 --> 19:27.953
The journey
of a thousand miles...

19:27.955 --> 19:33.058
begins with, uh... om.

19:33.060 --> 19:35.261
Who... who are you?

19:35.263 --> 19:41.534
Ssh... mind your silence.

19:41.636 --> 19:45.304
I mean, let your mind be silent.

19:45.306 --> 19:51.644
Silence your troubled heart and
embrace your, uh quiet mouth.

19:51.646 --> 19:54.280
Silence and listen.

19:54.282 --> 19:59.084
Okay, but I don't hear anything.

19:59.086 --> 20:05.591
Precisely, that is it...
the loudness of the silence.

20:05.593 --> 20:10.696
Oh, the loudness of the silence.
I don't understand.

20:10.698 --> 20:14.033
Hah-hah, this I already know,
my friend.

20:14.035 --> 20:18.771
My name is Deepak, and I am
here to help you understand.

20:18.773 --> 20:21.774
There are many things
you do not know, correct?

20:21.776 --> 20:23.609
Questions that life presents us.

20:23.611 --> 20:25.778
You? You know?

20:25.780 --> 20:27.379
I know.

20:27.381 --> 20:32.251
You know the answers to my questions?
About my place in the world? How?

20:32.253 --> 20:35.888
How? How? Oh, I know, I know...

20:35.890 --> 20:42.394
I know,
because I... I have seen.

20:42.396 --> 20:44.764
How? How?

20:44.766 --> 20:52.037
You know, I... I, uh...
Ali Bab... quantum physics.

20:55.875 --> 20:58.177
Whoa.

21:01.915 --> 21:06.452
Through meditation, my friend,
whole new vistas are open to me.

21:06.454 --> 21:11.957
Wow! That's... that's great!
Can you... can you show me?

21:11.959 --> 21:15.428
But of course, just...
just be quiet.

21:15.430 --> 21:22.434
Now breathe deep...
Breathe in and out.

21:22.536 --> 21:25.638
In... and out.

21:25.640 --> 21:29.208
In... hold that one.

21:31.511 --> 21:34.680
And out.

21:34.682 --> 21:40.052
Now look into my eyes.

21:42.890 --> 21:45.324
Okay.

21:45.326 --> 21:48.160
Argh! He is so frustrating.

21:48.162 --> 21:52.665
Trying to convince him
of his true worth.

21:52.667 --> 21:57.736
Argh! He is such a... guy!

22:02.742 --> 22:05.277
But I can't just
leave him like that.

22:05.279 --> 22:10.382
I can't desert him.
Nobody deserves that.

22:10.384 --> 22:15.154
Ribbit! Ribbit!

22:16.556 --> 22:17.056
Om.

22:20.695 --> 22:25.531
You feel like you
are in a deep, deep sleep.

22:25.533 --> 22:27.933
What do you call it?

22:27.935 --> 22:30.769
A trance.

22:30.771 --> 22:33.372
That's it, trance.

22:33.374 --> 22:37.509
Yes, you, you, frog...

22:37.511 --> 22:40.446
what do you seek most?

22:40.448 --> 22:43.182
My destiny, my... my place...

22:43.184 --> 22:44.717
the reason I'm here.

22:44.719 --> 22:50.689
Oh, yes, yes!
Most definitely I can see it.

22:50.691 --> 22:55.327
I see it. I can totally
see your destiny!

22:55.329 --> 22:57.096
What? What is it you see?

22:57.098 --> 23:00.432
Oh, it is something,
let me tell you.

23:00.434 --> 23:04.169
You, my friend,
are no mere frog.

23:04.171 --> 23:09.408
You are more than just
a tiny, little amphibian.

23:09.410 --> 23:12.511
You, you have a place
above us all.

23:12.513 --> 23:13.645
On top of the trees?

23:13.647 --> 23:16.348
Higher! In the skies?

23:16.350 --> 23:17.716
I'm a flying frog?

23:17.718 --> 23:21.787
What? No, no, no.
Same, same, but different.

23:21.789 --> 23:25.424
Your destiny is much higher
than that, my friend.

23:25.426 --> 23:29.128
You are no mere frog.

23:29.130 --> 23:31.997
Then, I'm human?

23:31.999 --> 23:37.069
Huh? Okay, yeah, sure, why not?
Yeah, you are human.

23:37.071 --> 23:43.742
You were cursed by the...
the, oh, um, let me see.

23:43.744 --> 23:47.379
Uh, give me one minute, om,
minute, uh...

23:47.381 --> 23:51.050
Uh, terrible, an evil glitch.

23:51.052 --> 23:52.518
An evil witch?

23:52.520 --> 23:56.321
Yes, yes, that is it,
an evil witch.

23:56.323 --> 24:01.660
And, and you are no ordinary
human, oh, no, my friend.

24:01.662 --> 24:04.096
You were a prince.

24:04.898 --> 24:08.467
I'm a human prince.

24:08.469 --> 24:11.069
Cursed by an evil witch.

24:11.071 --> 24:15.407
And you have lived your life
as a teensy, tine-sy frog.

24:15.409 --> 24:19.812
Yes! That's why I've always
felt like I don't belong!

24:19.814 --> 24:21.880
So, that's it! Yes!

24:21.882 --> 24:24.149
Irey, Bob, ay, yah, yah!

24:24.151 --> 24:28.554
Please, don't speak so loudly.

24:28.556 --> 24:30.189
Yes.

24:30.191 --> 24:34.860
Now, do you not want
that curse removed?

24:34.862 --> 24:37.362
Okay, do I kiss a princess?

24:37.364 --> 24:41.400
Huh? No, no, no, no.
No kissing, don't be gross.

24:41.402 --> 24:44.770
There are no princesses
around here anyway.

24:44.772 --> 24:47.372
But, there is another way.

24:47.374 --> 24:48.574
There is?

24:48.576 --> 24:50.909
Absolutely there is.

24:50.911 --> 24:55.681
Close your eyes
and listen very closely.

24:55.683 --> 24:57.182
I'm all ears.

24:57.184 --> 25:02.487
Clearly I am, too.
But now you must chant with me.

25:02.489 --> 25:07.626
Om... om. Om...

25:07.628 --> 25:10.963
Om... om. Very good.

25:10.965 --> 25:16.001
Lovely... and grateful.

25:16.003 --> 25:21.306
Om... om... Om...

25:23.409 --> 25:25.077
Hey! Ayee!

25:33.186 --> 25:34.286
Ayee!

25:34.288 --> 25:35.721
Get off my frog!

25:35.723 --> 25:38.624
Friend, eh...
get off my friend!

25:38.626 --> 25:41.827
Sandy, what are you doing here?

25:41.829 --> 25:43.462
What have you done to Deepak?

25:43.464 --> 25:45.731
He was about to tell me
how to break the curse.

25:45.733 --> 25:48.567
He was about to make
you his lunch!

25:48.569 --> 25:50.936
That vampire bat just bit you.

25:50.938 --> 25:52.838
You're lucky I showed up.

25:52.840 --> 25:55.240
Hah! You're lucky
you're not dead!

25:55.242 --> 25:56.975
Are you crazy
trying to bite me?

25:56.977 --> 26:00.612
I'm poisonous!
You know, poison?

26:01.814 --> 26:03.282
Beat it! Ayee!

26:04.317 --> 26:05.450
Ooh.

26:09.956 --> 26:11.557
Ayee!

26:19.700 --> 26:22.968
Deepak, wait!

26:26.372 --> 26:27.439
Huh?

26:30.009 --> 26:33.612
Argh, now what?

26:33.614 --> 26:38.684
Yes, I get it, I'm a prince. Need a kiss...
yes, princess... Ribbit?

26:38.686 --> 26:41.320
Ribbit? Ribbit!

26:42.922 --> 26:46.258
Hey, what did you do that for?

26:46.260 --> 26:49.995
Snap out of it.
What is wrong with you?

26:49.997 --> 26:52.597
You're mumbling to yourself
like a zombie.

26:52.599 --> 26:54.633
Are you all right?

26:54.635 --> 26:56.535
Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:56.537 --> 26:59.538
Come on, let's go home.

26:59.540 --> 27:01.907
I can't, I know what I am.

27:01.909 --> 27:03.809
What I'm supposed to do.

27:03.811 --> 27:05.744
Where are you going?

27:05.746 --> 27:08.947
I just need to find the humans,
so I can kiss a princess.

27:08.949 --> 27:11.984
Kiss a human? Ew!

27:11.986 --> 27:14.086
Wait... why?

27:14.088 --> 27:16.288
I was cursed, Sandy.

27:16.290 --> 27:18.857
A wicked witch cursed me
and now I'm a frog.

27:18.859 --> 27:20.859
What are you talking about?

27:20.861 --> 27:22.394
Don't you get it, Sandy?

27:22.396 --> 27:25.464
I'm a prince! A human prince!

27:25.466 --> 27:30.035
I just need to get a princess to kiss
me and the curse will be broken.

27:30.037 --> 27:32.904
Oh, of all the crazy things
you ever did.

27:32.906 --> 27:34.272
Argh!

27:34.274 --> 27:38.477
It's true. I finally
understand my destiny...

27:38.479 --> 27:40.112
my purpose in life.

27:40.114 --> 27:44.049
Your purpose
is to kiss a human?

27:44.051 --> 27:48.320
Fine, Sandy, go ahead
and make fun of me, it's okay.

27:48.322 --> 27:52.357
Because for once, finally,
it all makes sense.

27:53.926 --> 27:58.663
So you really want to go
find the humans?

27:58.665 --> 28:02.534
Okay, let's go.

28:02.536 --> 28:03.502
You mean it?

28:03.504 --> 28:06.705
Absolutely...
I'm not deserting you.

28:06.707 --> 28:08.907
Great! That's great!

28:08.909 --> 28:12.677
But... where?

28:12.679 --> 28:15.747
Up... to the top of the trees!

28:15.749 --> 28:18.250
We can see everything
from up there.

28:31.197 --> 28:34.166
Ribbit, can we please stop?

28:34.168 --> 28:35.567
We can't stop now.

28:35.569 --> 28:39.604
I... I just need to rest
for a while, you know?

28:39.606 --> 28:41.473
It's been a long day.

28:43.176 --> 28:47.479
Okay, but just for a while.
We've got a long way to go.

28:51.684 --> 28:54.486
Wow, what a day?

28:54.488 --> 28:58.156
I gotta tell you, Sandy,
the feeling is amazing.

28:58.158 --> 29:01.159
You can't imagine what a relief it
is to finally know my purpose...

29:01.161 --> 29:03.595
where I'm really meant to be.

29:03.597 --> 29:09.534
You know, Ribbit, you don't have to
be anything other than just yourself.

29:09.536 --> 29:10.936
I know that.

29:10.938 --> 29:14.005
Well, this thing you
want to find so bad...

29:14.007 --> 29:16.074
your place in the world.

29:16.076 --> 29:19.044
Maybe it's not so hard
to discover after all.

29:19.046 --> 29:20.946
You really think so?

29:20.948 --> 29:25.283
Yeah, all it really amounts to is
just being where you want to be.

29:25.285 --> 29:30.188
Up in the tree tops,
by the pond, who cares?

29:30.190 --> 29:34.893
In the end, it's not really
about a specific place.

29:34.895 --> 29:35.961
You know?

29:35.963 --> 29:37.596
Yeah, I guess so.

29:37.598 --> 29:42.767
But, if it's this important
to you, then we'll do it.

29:42.769 --> 29:45.137
Because you're my best friend.

29:45.139 --> 29:48.340
You've always been
there for me and...

29:48.342 --> 29:51.776
well, that's important,
because, well...

29:51.778 --> 29:58.283
the truth is, you're the most
important person in my life.

29:58.285 --> 30:03.088
And I can't imagine not having
you there...

30:03.090 --> 30:06.725
I mean here... beside me.

30:06.727 --> 30:11.596
Do you understand
what I'm trying to say?

30:11.598 --> 30:15.967
Ribbit? Ribbit?

30:15.969 --> 30:17.802
Ah.

31:09.789 --> 31:11.389
Ugh.

31:43.776 --> 31:46.023
Oh princess!

31:54.452 --> 31:55.862
Sandy!

31:56.363 --> 31:58.656
No sudden movements!

31:58.657 --> 32:01.278
One hard squeeze and we're done for.

32:01.279 --> 32:05.845
Pretty cuzz.
Oooh soft!

32:07.989 --> 32:10.720
Let the toad and the rat go, honey.

32:10.721 --> 32:12.607
They might have germs.

32:12.608 --> 32:15.130
A rat?
I'm a rat?

32:21.105 --> 32:24.268
Carla! Yoohoo!
Hey Carla!

32:24.269 --> 32:28.449
- Any luck?
- Oh, hi Avelina. Nothing yet.

32:28.450 --> 32:29.592
How about you?

32:29.593 --> 32:34.151
I'm not having any rock-it-all. Maybe
we should try higher up the tree.

32:34.352 --> 32:38.744
- Why are they yelling?
- They're howler monkeys, Ribbit.

32:38.745 --> 32:40.975
They're the loudest
creatures in the jungle.

32:40.976 --> 32:44.222
So they yell all the time?
They must be deaf.

32:44.523 --> 32:47.187
Excuse me!

32:47.188 --> 32:49.343
Can you hear me?

32:49.644 --> 32:53.936
Oh, ain't that cute? That little
toad is trying to say something.

32:54.337 --> 32:57.802
Can you... can you
set us free?

32:57.803 --> 33:01.264
We're aah... oh
a jolly toad and a rat.

33:01.265 --> 33:05.066
A rat! Yeeaa!
We're dirty.

33:05.067 --> 33:06.417
What is he saying?

33:06.518 --> 33:09.159
The little rat is saying something.

33:09.160 --> 33:11.063
Ooh, I think they're thirsty.

33:11.064 --> 33:15.042
Don't worry little rat.
We'll get you a drink, real soon.

33:19.842 --> 33:22.252
Well, howdy there little ladies.

33:22.253 --> 33:24.165
How's the herd doing?

33:24.166 --> 33:26.107
Not so great, Ben.

33:26.108 --> 33:29.374
All we got so far is a toad and a rat.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.747
A toad and a bat?

33:31.748 --> 33:35.098
What are we gonna do
with a toad and a bat?

33:35.099 --> 33:38.578
It's not a bat, Grandpa.
It's a rat.

33:38.579 --> 33:41.410
You know, a nasty, stinky rat.

33:41.411 --> 33:43.587
Why would you grab them?

33:43.788 --> 33:46.869
We didn't, Dad.
It was Bianca.

33:46.870 --> 33:49.115
She thought they were
something to play with.

33:49.116 --> 33:50.641
Hi Grandpa.

33:50.642 --> 33:53.054
Well, hello there, Button.

33:53.693 --> 33:57.391
What this I hear about
you playing with a bat?

33:57.392 --> 34:00.811
Not a bat, Grandpa.
A rat!

34:01.212 --> 34:06.385
Well that's not a bat. That's
some kind of kikajoo or something.

34:14.908 --> 34:17.605
Okay, now that
we have your attention.

34:18.106 --> 34:20.493
I'm sorry but my name is Ribbit.

34:20.494 --> 34:24.516
I'm a frog but really I'm a
prince who was cursed by a...

34:24.516 --> 34:28.534
- What did he say?
- He says his name is Rabbit.

34:28.534 --> 34:32.623
Rabbit? What the heck kind
of name is Rabbit for a toad?

34:32.824 --> 34:35.132
I'm not a toad!

34:35.733 --> 34:39.045
I'm Ribbit. I'm a frog.
My name is Ribbit.

34:39.047 --> 34:43.678
Well, you don't have to yell.
We're not deaf, you know?

34:43.679 --> 34:44.914
Let me try.

34:44.915 --> 34:49.417
The top.
We're trying to get to the top.

34:49.418 --> 34:53.290
We want to go up.
Can you hear me?

34:53.291 --> 34:55.746
Well, of course I can hear you.

34:55.947 --> 34:59.043
Kids nowadays, got no manners.

34:59.044 --> 35:03.764
Always yelling. You want
to go up, we'll let you go up.

35:03.765 --> 35:04.783
Thank you.

35:04.784 --> 35:08.192
Is it true?
Well, of course it's true.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.589
Are you calling me a liar?

35:10.790 --> 35:13.894
Strange little fella, isn't it?

35:15.595 --> 35:17.374
Ah, goodbye.

35:17.375 --> 35:21.564
Don't cry... Why in
the world would I cry?

35:21.865 --> 35:25.922
Youngsters nowadays,
I'll never understand them.

35:26.023 --> 35:31.184
All their talk is nonsense and
rubbish. Nothing ever make sense.

35:37.688 --> 35:39.755
Are we there yet?

35:39.757 --> 35:41.958
Ribbit, stop asking me that.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.994
That's like the tenth time
in an hour.

35:44.996 --> 35:47.496
We've been climbing
like forever.

35:47.498 --> 35:52.667
Oh, and I thought you were Mister I want
to get a kiss from a human princess.

35:52.669 --> 35:55.136
Where's your enthusiasm?

35:55.138 --> 35:59.240
All I asked was
are we there yet? Jeez.

36:00.643 --> 36:01.942
Look!

36:16.623 --> 36:18.490
Wow.

36:18.492 --> 36:22.727
I... wow.

36:22.729 --> 36:25.095
It's magnificent.

36:25.097 --> 36:27.097
Yeah.

36:27.099 --> 36:30.968
I've never seen
anything like it.

36:30.970 --> 36:34.604
So, now what?

36:34.606 --> 36:35.805
Huh?

36:35.807 --> 36:38.141
You wanted to get
to the top of the trees.

36:38.143 --> 36:40.610
We're here. So now what?

36:40.612 --> 36:45.048
I thought... I don't know, I thought we'd
be able to see the humans from here.

36:45.050 --> 36:47.516
Or they'd have a kingdom
up here.

36:47.518 --> 36:49.684
A kingdom in the sky?

36:49.686 --> 36:53.021
So you think they like live
in the clouds or something?

36:53.023 --> 36:55.022
Don't make fun of me, Sandy.

36:55.024 --> 36:57.391
You know I didn't mean it
like that, Ribbit.

36:57.393 --> 36:59.092
It must be here.

36:59.094 --> 37:02.295
I mean, we should at least be
able to see it from here.

37:02.297 --> 37:03.463
I know it.

37:03.465 --> 37:09.169
But there's nothing.
Nothing. Where are they?

37:09.171 --> 37:11.437
I know where the humans are.

37:11.439 --> 37:13.105
What? Who said that?

37:16.977 --> 37:18.977
I said it.

37:18.979 --> 37:22.713
I'm sorry, but I couldn't help
but overhear your conversation.

37:22.715 --> 37:23.982
Who are you?

37:23.984 --> 37:26.917
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

37:26.919 --> 37:29.653
excuse my manners.

37:29.655 --> 37:31.722
I am Terrence.

37:31.724 --> 37:33.457
What are you doing up here?

37:33.459 --> 37:35.358
Ribbit.

37:35.360 --> 37:40.496
Oh, it's okay, honey. I guess
I did kind of surprise you.

37:40.498 --> 37:46.368
Well, to answer your question, I come up
here every morning to watch the sun rise.

37:46.370 --> 37:52.706
I mean, honestly, have you ever
seen a more beautiful sunrise?

37:52.708 --> 37:56.744
I don't think so.

37:57.946 --> 37:59.846
Um, yeah, I guess so.

37:59.848 --> 38:01.514
It's nice.

38:01.516 --> 38:05.084
Nice? Well, that's got to be the
understatement of the century.

38:05.086 --> 38:09.921
Just look at those colors.

38:09.923 --> 38:16.427
Look at that crimson and the way the
scarlet blends with that carnelian.

38:16.429 --> 38:18.597
Oh!

38:18.599 --> 38:22.199
Wow! You're right.
The colors are beautiful.

38:22.201 --> 38:24.734
They certainly are.

38:24.736 --> 38:27.705
Colors are my life.

38:27.707 --> 38:29.939
Ever since I was a hatchling...

38:29.941 --> 38:32.741
I've had this gift for colors.

38:32.743 --> 38:34.778
It's like they speak to me.

38:34.780 --> 38:39.548
Take you, for example.
What an interesting combination.

38:39.550 --> 38:40.748
Huh?

38:40.750 --> 38:44.452
Oh, please, how could you not
notice your own colors?

38:44.454 --> 38:49.322
The way the harlequin blends
into a beautiful pear...

38:49.324 --> 38:54.294
before ending up a lovely shade
of chartreuse yellow.

38:54.296 --> 38:56.496
Oh... it's just stunning.

38:56.498 --> 38:59.966
Really? Well, I guess
they are kind of nice colors.

38:59.968 --> 39:01.834
What?

39:01.836 --> 39:03.002
Nothing.

39:03.004 --> 39:04.703
I always thought
you were pretty.

39:04.705 --> 39:05.871
Huh, Sandy.

39:06.941 --> 39:09.340
You really are lucky.

39:09.342 --> 39:12.243
A lot of animals don't
get bright colors.

39:12.245 --> 39:13.812
Take your little friend here.

39:13.814 --> 39:15.246
Hey!

39:15.248 --> 39:19.116
Oh, sweetie, I didn't mean
anything bad.

39:19.118 --> 39:21.351
But you are a typical
female, you know.

39:21.353 --> 39:23.887
Kind of bland
compared to us boys.

39:23.889 --> 39:25.755
Well, I think she looks nice.

39:25.757 --> 39:28.926
You know, I've always thought...
hey, wait a minute!

39:28.928 --> 39:30.827
You said you know
where the humans are.

39:30.829 --> 39:36.064
It's just nature's way of helping
us boys attract attention.

39:36.066 --> 39:40.068
Goodness knows, we need
all the help we can get.

39:40.070 --> 39:43.137
You said you know
where they are, the humans.

39:43.139 --> 39:48.375
Oh, please, why would you
be interested in humans?

39:48.377 --> 39:52.646
They're so bland, just
blah-brown creatures.

39:52.648 --> 39:54.380
And they all look alike.

39:54.382 --> 39:56.082
Seen one, seen 'em all.

39:56.084 --> 39:59.518
Of course, there is that
one female human.

39:59.520 --> 40:02.554
She wears beautiful colors
in her hair.

40:02.556 --> 40:07.525
And bright, shiny gold stuff all
around her neck and her arms.

40:07.527 --> 40:12.063
And all the other humans give her food
and follow her everywhere she goes.

40:12.065 --> 40:14.432
Nutty girl.

40:14.434 --> 40:19.536
They call her, um... Princess.

40:19.538 --> 40:20.403
Princess?

40:20.405 --> 40:23.005
You know where a princess is?

40:23.007 --> 40:26.343
Well, I suppose so,
but who cares about humans?

40:26.345 --> 40:29.845
Your colors are much prettier
than any humans.

40:29.847 --> 40:32.081
I'll take bright colors any day.

40:32.083 --> 40:34.683
You don't understand,
I'm not really a frog.

40:34.685 --> 40:39.087
Oh, wait, don't tell me,
you're a python in disguise.

40:41.858 --> 40:44.158
Oh, I kill myself sometimes.

40:44.160 --> 40:45.559
Oh, no, no, no, no.

40:45.561 --> 40:48.428
I'm actually a prince,
a human prince.

40:48.430 --> 40:51.465
I was cursed by a wicked witch, and
I need a kiss from a princess...

40:51.467 --> 40:53.099
to turn back into my real self.

40:53.101 --> 40:59.705
A prince, a frog! Prince... wait
'til the girls hear about this!

41:01.575 --> 41:04.009
But... don't laugh, okay?
It's what I am.

41:04.011 --> 41:06.978
No, no, of course not.

41:06.980 --> 41:09.079
It's what I am.

41:16.821 --> 41:18.923
Help, I can't breathe.

41:20.325 --> 41:23.560
Okay, fine,
just laugh it up then.

41:23.562 --> 41:28.198
It's okay, Ribbit. We'll find
someone else who can help us.

41:30.067 --> 41:33.935
No, no, wait.
I'm sorry, I really am.

41:33.937 --> 41:36.505
I want to help you,
honest I do.

41:36.507 --> 41:38.906
Really? you'll tell me
where the humans are?

41:38.908 --> 41:44.545
But rather than tell you,
why don't I just show you?

41:44.547 --> 41:45.679
Show us?

41:45.681 --> 41:48.548
Yes, well, kind of.

41:48.550 --> 41:53.319
I remember it's next to the
ribbon that never ends.

41:53.321 --> 41:55.387
The ribbon that never ends?

41:55.389 --> 42:00.059
That's right, the ribbon
of water. It's that way!

42:00.061 --> 42:03.294
I can't see any ribbon of water.

42:03.296 --> 42:07.365
Of course not, it's miles away.

42:07.367 --> 42:09.833
How are we gonna get
all the way over there?

42:09.835 --> 42:11.935
I... I don't...

42:11.937 --> 42:14.805
Why don't I take you?

42:14.807 --> 42:16.673
You? How?

42:16.675 --> 42:20.076
I'll just fly you there, silly.

42:20.078 --> 42:21.811
The two of you
don't weigh very much.

42:21.813 --> 42:25.581
You can just hop on my back,
and hold on tight.

42:25.583 --> 42:27.382
Sandy?

42:27.384 --> 42:31.486
What the heck, why not?

42:31.488 --> 42:34.421
So, what are we waiting for?

42:36.491 --> 42:40.160
Ready now? Hold on tight!

42:43.298 --> 42:46.333
<i>â™ª On a shooting star</i>

42:46.335 --> 42:50.236
<i>â™ª I wish for you and me</i>

42:50.238 --> 42:57.276
<i>â™ª To lay our worlds together
Under our special tree</i>

42:58.444 --> 43:02.114
There it is!
The ribbon of water!

43:02.116 --> 43:05.750
<i>â™ª You're a brave
And mighty king</i>

43:05.752 --> 43:09.587
<i>â™ª And when you crown
Your true love</i>

43:09.589 --> 43:13.356
<i>â™ª You'll be smiling Back at me</i>

43:13.358 --> 43:17.761
<i>â™ª Is this the night</i>

43:17.763 --> 43:25.434
<i>â™ª Finally we'll look
Into each other's eyes</i>

43:25.436 --> 43:29.237
<i>â™ª For the first time</i>

43:29.239 --> 43:35.676
<i>â™ª That magical moment
When your lips kiss mine</i>

43:35.678 --> 43:40.447
<i>â™ª You will finally
Know the truth</i>

43:40.449 --> 43:45.751
<i>â™ª If the one you dream of
Wishes for you</i>

43:48.922 --> 43:56.328
<i>â™ª Finally will look
Into each others' eyes</i>

43:56.330 --> 44:00.198
<i>â™ª For the first time</i>

44:00.200 --> 44:03.935
<i>â™ª That magical moment</i>

44:03.937 --> 44:07.571
<i>â™ª When your lips kiss mine</i>

44:07.573 --> 44:10.774
<i>â™ª And we'll finally know
The truth</i>

44:10.776 --> 44:17.079
<i>â™ª That the one you dream of
Wished for you</i>

44:18.281 --> 44:20.216
We're coming in for a landing.

44:20.218 --> 44:22.651
Hang on!

44:24.754 --> 44:26.955
Whoa!

44:35.163 --> 44:38.898
Last stop, boys and girls.

44:41.668 --> 44:44.304
Terrence, we can't
thank you enough.

44:44.306 --> 44:47.239
Oh, don't sweat it, sweetie.

44:47.241 --> 44:49.241
It was my pleasure.

44:49.243 --> 44:52.144
So, which way do we go now?

44:54.546 --> 44:56.748
Just follow the water.

44:56.750 --> 45:00.218
Sooner or later,
you'll find the humans.

45:00.220 --> 45:02.786
Well, gotta fly.

45:04.056 --> 45:08.658
You kids be good now. Bye!

45:12.396 --> 45:15.231
Man, am I pooped.

45:15.233 --> 45:18.067
I know what you mean.

45:18.069 --> 45:20.101
I'm thirsty, wanna get a drink?

45:20.103 --> 45:24.906
Uh, you go ahead, I'm just
gonna look around for a bit.

45:38.919 --> 45:40.019
Ah.

46:05.242 --> 46:07.443
Did you ever think
we'd get this far?

46:07.445 --> 46:10.079
I guess we have travelled
quite a distance.

46:10.081 --> 46:12.448
But that doesn't mean we're
close to our goal.

46:12.450 --> 46:14.416
We still haven't found
the princess.

46:14.418 --> 46:19.521
Yeah, but just yesterday we were hanging
out by the pond, living our normal lives.

46:19.523 --> 46:22.690
And one day later,
just look at us.

46:22.692 --> 46:25.159
You survived the tree house
getting destroyed.

46:25.161 --> 46:29.696
And we've been to the top of the
trees, and now flew way over here.

46:29.698 --> 46:32.032
Tell me that is not amazing.

46:32.034 --> 46:34.534
Yeah, I guess so.

46:41.608 --> 46:44.076
G'day, mates.

46:45.745 --> 46:47.580
Agh!

46:47.582 --> 46:51.716
I don't reckon I've seen you
two around these parts.

46:51.718 --> 46:55.052
New to the area, are you?

46:55.054 --> 46:58.622
Uh, yes, sir. We just arrived.

46:58.624 --> 47:02.692
Really? How interesting.

47:02.694 --> 47:07.563
And what brings you
to my neck of the jungle?

47:07.565 --> 47:09.431
Uh, we're looking
for the humans?

47:09.433 --> 47:12.168
Humans? Ack!

47:12.170 --> 47:14.369
Nasty creatures.

47:14.371 --> 47:21.209
They smell awful, and on top of that,
they're really tough, kind of chewy.

47:21.211 --> 47:23.177
And crunchy.

47:23.179 --> 47:28.849
Yeah, you know what they say,
you are what you eat.

47:28.851 --> 47:30.250
Exactly.

47:30.252 --> 47:33.520
Lovely weather we're having...
don't you think?

47:33.522 --> 47:35.688
It is a nice day, isn't it?

47:36.557 --> 47:40.826
And just about... snack time.

47:41.694 --> 47:43.795
Snack? Hey, look at the time.

47:43.797 --> 47:46.797
We'd love to stay and chat, but
we still got a long way to go.

47:46.799 --> 47:53.170
No, there's still heaps of time
before the day ends.

47:53.172 --> 47:58.408
Besides, if you leave now, I might
think you didn't like my company.

47:58.410 --> 48:01.444
And that might make me angry.

48:01.446 --> 48:04.613
You wouldn't like me
when I'm angry.

48:04.615 --> 48:06.515
I wouldn't? Wait.

48:06.517 --> 48:09.151
Well, then let's not
make you angry.

48:09.153 --> 48:13.489
So, what say you two join me
for an afternoon snack?

48:14.591 --> 48:16.558
Hey, look, look, pretty colors.

48:16.560 --> 48:18.792
I mean, I mean, bright colors.

48:18.794 --> 48:21.663
Yes! Um, that means
he's poisonous.

48:21.665 --> 48:24.464
Poison, bad tummy. Bad tummy.

48:24.466 --> 48:29.269
Oh, I think I'll take
my chances.

48:34.309 --> 48:35.307
Huh?

48:57.361 --> 48:59.828
I took care of him good, yah?

48:59.830 --> 49:02.332
Yah, you did good, Ollie.

49:02.334 --> 49:03.700
Huh?

49:07.670 --> 49:10.572
Thank you for saving us.

49:10.574 --> 49:13.307
It's no problem, my dear.

49:13.309 --> 49:18.112
I am Ollie,
and this is my wife, JoJo.

49:18.114 --> 49:21.214
My wife and I have been so
disgust with...

49:21.216 --> 49:23.850
Disgusted.

49:23.852 --> 49:25.118
Ooh!

49:26.153 --> 49:28.754
We are both so disgusted...

49:28.756 --> 49:35.494
at that caiman terrorizing all the nice,
little creatures that come to drink here.

49:35.496 --> 49:39.097
Until we have no vits-tors.

49:39.099 --> 49:41.699
Vits-tors? Oh, visitors.

49:41.701 --> 49:43.568
Oh, yeah, that's...
that's great.

49:43.570 --> 49:44.968
Thanks.

49:44.970 --> 49:47.270
Where are you two, little sweet
plums off to?

49:47.272 --> 49:48.740
We're gonna go see the humans.

49:48.742 --> 49:51.975
The humans? What would
you want with the humans?

49:51.977 --> 49:54.477
Oh, yeah, it's a long story.

49:54.479 --> 49:56.784
But my friend here, he
wants to kiss their

49:56.810 --> 49:59.248
princess, so he can turn
into a human prince.

49:59.250 --> 50:01.083
What?

50:21.469 --> 50:23.102
What's so funny?

50:23.104 --> 50:24.904
Oh, oh, come on, Ribbit.

50:24.906 --> 50:27.974
You have to admit, it's a pretty
crazy sounding story.

50:27.976 --> 50:32.044
But, hey, since we're here, we might
as well go and see the humans.

50:32.046 --> 50:36.014
So this little fella is a
prince? So romantic.

50:36.016 --> 50:40.251
Ollie, why don't you do something
like this frog do for his lo-ver?

50:40.253 --> 50:42.787
Loafer? What's a loafer?

50:42.789 --> 50:44.522
Sandy, did you hear,
she just called you a loafer.

50:44.524 --> 50:46.556
Are you a loafer?

50:46.558 --> 50:50.860
Oh, it's nothing like that.

50:50.862 --> 50:52.996
Are you turning red?

50:52.998 --> 50:54.097
No.

50:54.099 --> 50:56.198
No, you are,
you're turning red.

50:56.200 --> 50:57.433
I am not.

50:57.435 --> 50:59.668
Wait, wait, stop.

50:59.670 --> 51:02.671
So, you want to see the humans?

51:02.673 --> 51:05.908
Yes! Can you please
take us to them?

51:05.910 --> 51:09.477
Well, wast-est way is by wiver.

51:09.479 --> 51:10.845
Wast-est, wiver?

51:10.847 --> 51:12.746
Oh, fastest by the river.

51:12.748 --> 51:14.615
Wait, you mean we have
to swim the whole way?

51:14.617 --> 51:20.519
No problem for you, yah?
You are rog.

51:20.521 --> 51:21.722
I'm a rog?

51:21.724 --> 51:23.956
Oh, you mean, yeah, I'm a frog.

51:23.958 --> 51:25.258
But no, no, no, no, no.

51:25.260 --> 51:29.662
See, I'm a human on the inside,
that's why I hate water.

51:29.664 --> 51:33.064
A rog that hates water?

51:33.066 --> 51:34.699
Oh, oh my!

51:36.302 --> 51:37.802
What is so funny?

51:37.804 --> 51:39.737
Nothing, my friend.

51:41.540 --> 51:43.607
And I'm not a great swimmer.

51:43.609 --> 51:45.342
It's a fur thing, you know?

51:45.344 --> 51:46.910
Wait a minute.

51:46.912 --> 51:49.078
Ollie? Yah, my dear?

51:49.080 --> 51:50.246
We can help them.

51:50.248 --> 51:51.380
How?

51:51.382 --> 51:52.481
Just stay right here.

51:52.483 --> 51:54.450
I'll be right back.

51:57.653 --> 51:58.854
Where is she going?

51:58.856 --> 52:03.625
When JoJo asks us to stay,
we stay.

52:03.627 --> 52:07.027
Don't ask too many
questions, yah?

52:15.102 --> 52:18.972
Well, they can sit on it
and ride down the river.

52:18.974 --> 52:21.006
Then you find the humans.

52:21.008 --> 52:23.542
We have seen signs of them
along the river.

52:23.544 --> 52:27.780
Why, yes, you are so smart,
sweetie.

52:27.782 --> 52:30.848
That's why I love you so much.

52:32.252 --> 52:34.352
Hop aboard!

52:38.990 --> 52:42.559
Okay, human kingdom,
here we come!

52:51.234 --> 52:55.437
You two, stay in the middle,
nice und dry. You hear?

52:55.439 --> 52:58.740
We will. Thank you so much.

52:58.742 --> 53:02.042
It is our pleasure. Good luck.

53:02.044 --> 53:04.779
Such cute, little fellas, hey?

53:04.781 --> 53:07.447
They will have some fun now.

53:25.932 --> 53:27.532
They sure were nice, those two.

53:29.235 --> 53:33.437
Yeah, they seemed so happy
together.

53:33.439 --> 53:36.540
They've got chemistry.

53:36.542 --> 53:39.542
Yeah, and so do we.

53:39.544 --> 53:41.778
Really?

53:41.780 --> 53:45.515
Yeah. I mean,
we're like ants and trees.

53:46.717 --> 53:49.618
Ants? Trees?

53:49.620 --> 53:54.890
Yeah, trees give the ants a home, and
ants protect the trees from invaders.

53:54.892 --> 53:58.927
So who's the ant? Me... or you?

54:00.362 --> 54:02.530
Um... you?

54:02.532 --> 54:04.831
Oh, so I'm antsy.

54:04.833 --> 54:06.567
No. No... okay.

54:06.569 --> 54:07.901
You can be the trees.

54:07.903 --> 54:10.971
Oh, so now I'm like wooden?

54:10.973 --> 54:14.507
No, I didn't say...
ugh, you just don't get it.

54:17.177 --> 54:19.711
Relax, Ribbit,
I'm just teasing you.

54:21.348 --> 54:24.449
What's wrong? Can't you take
a little ribbing, Ribbit?

54:24.451 --> 54:27.118
Oh... really? A Ribbit pun?

54:27.120 --> 54:29.186
Fine, you're the ant again.

54:29.188 --> 54:31.856
Well, you are kind of antsy,
you know?

54:33.626 --> 54:35.859
Whoa. What was that?

54:35.861 --> 54:37.728
Could be a rock.

54:37.730 --> 54:41.197
Huh? Huh?

54:53.109 --> 54:56.378
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

54:58.046 --> 55:00.114
Agh!

55:00.116 --> 55:01.582
Whoa!

55:18.798 --> 55:22.266
Oh, god, help me!

55:22.268 --> 55:23.534
No!

55:23.536 --> 55:26.170
On the log! On the log! Agh!

55:33.312 --> 55:35.045
Hold on. Hold on.

55:36.147 --> 55:37.547
Phew.

55:37.549 --> 55:39.381
Ah...

55:46.021 --> 55:52.293
Well, now,
fancy meeting you two here.

55:53.163 --> 55:55.964
Now take it easy, big guy.

55:55.966 --> 55:59.499
My name's Kai. I suggest
you don't forget it.

55:59.501 --> 56:02.668
It'll be the last thing
you ever remember.

56:03.806 --> 56:06.073
Kai, we didn't mean you
any harm.

56:06.075 --> 56:08.874
Oh, you got that right.

56:08.876 --> 56:12.278
I'm the one who does
the harming around here.

56:12.280 --> 56:13.713
Look!

56:23.122 --> 56:25.789
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

56:25.791 --> 56:27.424
No, no!

56:30.295 --> 56:31.761
Ribbit, hold me!

56:31.763 --> 56:34.297
Not now, Sandy!

56:39.268 --> 56:43.139
Agh!

56:44.541 --> 56:48.042
Hah-hah! Woo-hoo!

56:48.044 --> 56:50.679
Yeah! Way to go, Sandy!

56:50.681 --> 56:52.847
Whoa!

56:52.849 --> 56:55.282
Hold on! This could be rough!

56:56.717 --> 56:59.453
Agh!

57:20.438 --> 57:23.741
Sandy? Sandy?

57:24.842 --> 57:26.977
Sandy?

57:26.979 --> 57:30.847
Oh, no. Sandy!

57:30.849 --> 57:34.083
Sandy!

57:36.319 --> 57:38.821
Sandy...

57:41.457 --> 57:44.092
Yea!

57:46.596 --> 57:48.830
I want to, Momma, please?

57:48.832 --> 57:50.230
Show me how again.

57:50.232 --> 57:53.600
Okay, Sandy, but don't worry
too much.

57:53.602 --> 57:56.804
You'll be flying
by yourself in no time.

57:56.806 --> 57:59.305
I know, Momma,
but I want to do it now.

57:59.307 --> 58:02.123
Now pay close attention
and watch how I shift

58:02.149 --> 58:04.510
my arms and legs to
control my flight.

58:04.512 --> 58:06.278
Ready? Uh-huh.

58:09.383 --> 58:10.816
Yea!

58:16.456 --> 58:18.589
Momma!

58:23.327 --> 58:26.863
Well, look what we've got here.

58:26.865 --> 58:31.533
Huh, you'll do quite
nicely in our zoo.

58:37.508 --> 58:38.673
Sandy!

58:38.675 --> 58:41.643
Momma! Momma!

58:41.645 --> 58:45.880
Sandy! Sandy!

58:45.882 --> 58:49.250
Sandy! Sandy!
Help! Help!

58:50.852 --> 58:52.519
Help!

58:54.688 --> 58:56.223
Help! Huh?

58:56.225 --> 58:59.625
Hold on, Sandy! I'm coming!

59:03.998 --> 59:07.232
Ribbit! Hurry!

59:08.234 --> 59:11.268
I can't... I can't...

59:14.440 --> 59:15.839
Agh!

59:24.481 --> 59:26.048
Mon Dieu!

59:26.050 --> 59:28.951
Today, we will have Decca
Rouen...

59:28.953 --> 59:31.920
such provincial fares,
this squirrel.

59:34.958 --> 59:41.962
Ah, succulent dark meat, with
more taste than baby rabbit.

59:41.964 --> 59:43.598
Ribbit!

59:43.600 --> 59:45.866
Patience, mon petit.

59:45.868 --> 59:51.205
You cannot rush a chef when he
is creating a masterpiece!

59:51.207 --> 59:54.974
Would you rush the moon
in its flight across the sky?

59:54.976 --> 59:57.242
Of course, not.

59:57.244 --> 01:00:01.914
Perfection takes patience, yes?

01:00:01.916 --> 01:00:06.718
Perhaps a confit...
or just tartar.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.253
What do you think?

01:00:08.255 --> 01:00:13.023
Ah, I have some la chou to take
away that gamey smell, no?

01:00:13.025 --> 01:00:17.127
No! No! Help! Help!

01:00:17.129 --> 01:00:20.497
I'm coming, Sandy!
Just hold on!

01:00:26.002 --> 01:00:30.239
No! No! No! Agh!

01:00:30.241 --> 01:00:33.308
Huh-huh! SacrÃ© bleu!

01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:35.176
Sie heavens bless me.

01:00:35.178 --> 01:00:37.377
Squirrel and frog legs
for dinner?

01:00:37.379 --> 01:00:41.748
Ho-ho-ho! What have I done
to deserve such a banquet?

01:00:55.329 --> 01:00:59.864
Mon ami! Such strong legs, no?

01:00:59.866 --> 01:01:04.436
Lots of muscle... lots of meat.

01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:13.811
Sandy! Hang on, I'm coming!

01:01:18.849 --> 01:01:24.453
Mon Dieu! What chef ever have
to fight sie frog for its legs?

01:01:24.455 --> 01:01:28.857
This will be
my piÃ©ce de rÃ©sistance!

01:01:28.859 --> 01:01:30.424
Agh!

01:01:48.142 --> 01:01:50.909
Ribbit, you saved us.

01:01:54.981 --> 01:01:57.416
Oh, I thought you were dead.

01:01:57.418 --> 01:01:59.717
Let me get you out of this.

01:02:01.053 --> 01:02:03.655
You need to snap the web.

01:02:06.358 --> 01:02:08.191
Hold on, Sandy.

01:02:08.193 --> 01:02:09.459
Where are you going?

01:02:17.534 --> 01:02:18.567
Ah!

01:02:37.352 --> 01:02:39.086
I got you, Sandy.

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:40.987
Don't worry.

01:02:59.706 --> 01:03:02.673
Sandy?

01:03:02.675 --> 01:03:04.475
Are you okay?

01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:16.686
They say that landing
is the hardest part.

01:03:16.688 --> 01:03:18.287
Hah! Hah!

01:03:21.157 --> 01:03:22.391
You're alive!

01:03:22.393 --> 01:03:25.693
You're alive!
I thought I lost you!

01:03:28.897 --> 01:03:31.966
Oh, my gosh! I... I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:03:31.968 --> 01:03:35.302
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
Did I poison you?

01:03:35.304 --> 01:03:38.472
I... I didn't mean to poison you!

01:03:45.412 --> 01:03:46.912
Are you okay?

01:03:46.914 --> 01:03:48.114
Uh-huh.

01:04:07.264 --> 01:04:09.833
If you hadn't been
such a great flier...

01:04:09.835 --> 01:04:12.535
we would have been mush at the
bottom of that waterfall.

01:04:12.537 --> 01:04:16.471
Well, you did a great job
of saving me right back.

01:04:16.473 --> 01:04:19.808
You know, for somebody
who doesn't swim or jump...

01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:22.411
you sure did a pretty good
imitation just now.

01:04:22.413 --> 01:04:24.512
What are you talking about?

01:04:24.514 --> 01:04:26.181
I nearly got us killed.

01:04:26.183 --> 01:04:27.715
Are you crazy?

01:04:27.717 --> 01:04:29.683
You fought off that spider...

01:04:29.685 --> 01:04:32.185
jumped high into the air
to free me from the web...

01:04:32.187 --> 01:04:36.623
and then to top it off, you grabbed me
out of the water and swam us to safety.

01:04:36.625 --> 01:04:40.960
Wow, I... I guess
I did do that, didn't I?

01:04:40.962 --> 01:04:46.231
I mean, I didn't think about it, I just
let my natural instincts take control.

01:04:46.233 --> 01:04:47.965
Yeah?

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:52.236
Well, I think you should let your
instincts take control more often.

01:04:52.238 --> 01:04:55.672
Well, we've made it
this far, now what?

01:04:56.775 --> 01:05:00.710
Well, they said follow
the river, so...

01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:22.464
There they are!

01:05:22.466 --> 01:05:26.099
We found them! We found them!

01:05:32.739 --> 01:05:35.943
And when I become the prince,
I'll make you something.

01:05:35.945 --> 01:05:39.612
And then I'll feed you
berries and nuts, and...

01:05:39.614 --> 01:05:42.915
Oh, you'll be glad
you know me. Oh...

01:05:45.018 --> 01:05:47.953
Hey, look, a pond!

01:06:01.066 --> 01:06:03.333
Sandy, look.

01:06:03.335 --> 01:06:07.203
The frogs...
they're just like me.

01:06:33.594 --> 01:06:38.898
Yes, yes, good.

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:40.399
This will do.

01:06:40.401 --> 01:06:44.702
One can never have
too much poison.

01:06:44.704 --> 01:06:47.639
Take these back and put them
with the others.

01:07:12.863 --> 01:07:14.663
It's safe.

01:07:20.602 --> 01:07:23.103
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what just happened?

01:07:23.105 --> 01:07:24.203
Who was that human?

01:07:24.205 --> 01:07:27.707
They call him the Witch Doctor.

01:07:27.709 --> 01:07:31.843
For years now, he has been coming
and capturing our male frogs.

01:07:31.845 --> 01:07:35.114
Always the biggest and the
brightest colored.

01:07:35.116 --> 01:07:36.815
And we never see them again.

01:07:36.817 --> 01:07:40.084
Soon, we will all be gone.

01:07:40.086 --> 01:07:44.455
That's horrible,
someone's gotta do something.

01:07:44.457 --> 01:07:47.792
What can we do?
We're just frogs.

01:07:47.794 --> 01:07:50.361
But you can't just sit here
and let this happen.

01:07:50.363 --> 01:07:54.364
With the men gone, we must stay
and care for the children.

01:07:54.366 --> 01:07:57.801
Ribbit, we've got
to do something.

01:07:57.803 --> 01:08:00.569
We can't let these poor families
be torn apart like this.

01:08:00.571 --> 01:08:02.838
You're right, Sandy.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.473
We'll go and save them.

01:08:04.475 --> 01:08:06.408
You mean it?

01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:08.443
Of course, I do.

01:08:08.445 --> 01:08:10.812
We can do this.

01:08:10.814 --> 01:08:14.782
After all, someone taught me
that if I put my mind to it...

01:08:14.784 --> 01:08:17.818
anything is possible.

01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:20.087
You ready to do this?

01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:21.622
Uh-huh.

01:08:25.258 --> 01:08:27.861
We'll be back soon!

01:08:27.863 --> 01:08:29.662
Goodbye!

01:08:58.988 --> 01:09:00.189
Come on!

01:09:12.533 --> 01:09:13.966
Huh?

01:09:13.969 --> 01:09:17.037
Sandy, jump!

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:32.317
That's her... that's gotta
be the princess.

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:36.988
And she's being waited on hand and
foot by all those other humans.

01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:38.723
Tough life.

01:09:38.725 --> 01:09:40.491
Are you jealous?

01:09:40.493 --> 01:09:43.026
What? No!

01:09:44.796 --> 01:09:50.100
Ah, Princess...
having a stroll, I see.

01:09:50.102 --> 01:09:52.667
I just want to see how the
villagers are doing.

01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:57.640
Ah, yes, the preparations.

01:09:57.642 --> 01:10:01.142
Tomorrow is the big day,
isn't it?

01:10:01.144 --> 01:10:03.611
You become our queen.

01:10:03.613 --> 01:10:06.581
I thank you for leading our
people all this while.

01:10:06.583 --> 01:10:09.551
I hope you will lend me
your wisdom as I lead.

01:10:09.553 --> 01:10:11.752
You want wisdom.

01:10:11.754 --> 01:10:16.723
Then perhaps it's not so safe for you
to be wandering around the village.

01:10:16.725 --> 01:10:21.661
After all, we wouldn't want
anything to happen to you.

01:10:21.663 --> 01:10:23.962
I thank you for your advice.

01:10:27.401 --> 01:10:29.334
Hm.

01:10:29.336 --> 01:10:30.535
Ahh.

01:10:30.537 --> 01:10:32.536
What are you doing?

01:10:32.538 --> 01:10:34.773
We have to rescue the frogs!

01:10:34.775 --> 01:10:37.641
We have to follow that man.

01:10:37.643 --> 01:10:39.744
Huh? What?

01:10:39.746 --> 01:10:42.213
Ribbit, the frogs.

01:10:42.215 --> 01:10:44.115
Uh... of course!

01:10:45.382 --> 01:10:46.783
You're right, let's go!

01:11:10.872 --> 01:11:14.307
One, two, three, four.

01:11:14.309 --> 01:11:16.943
Ah... number six.

01:11:16.945 --> 01:11:20.781
I'll take number six.

01:11:22.916 --> 01:11:25.316
Ahh.

01:11:32.725 --> 01:11:37.028
Just a little more poison.

01:11:40.599 --> 01:11:41.831
Mm.

01:11:47.771 --> 01:11:53.342
Yes... excellent. Heh-heh.

01:12:04.085 --> 01:12:06.053
Ah.

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:08.122
Philippe!

01:12:09.658 --> 01:12:11.891
Take this to the
princess' chamber.

01:12:11.893 --> 01:12:14.027
Be careful,
do not spill a drop.

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:18.730
I shall serve her
the drink myself later.

01:12:18.732 --> 01:12:25.170
It is a special drink
for any ruler to be.

01:12:25.172 --> 01:12:26.605
Yes, sire.

01:12:26.607 --> 01:12:33.110
And soon, I will be king.

01:12:45.021 --> 01:12:47.656
Wait! Where are you going?

01:12:47.658 --> 01:12:50.359
To save the frogs, of course.

01:12:50.361 --> 01:12:52.093
But you heard him.

01:12:52.095 --> 01:12:55.663
He's gonna poison the princess.
We can't let that happen.

01:12:55.665 --> 01:12:58.132
You can't just leave
these frogs here.

01:12:58.134 --> 01:13:00.934
You're right,
we have to split up.

01:13:00.936 --> 01:13:04.204
You release the frogs
and I'll help the princess.

01:13:04.206 --> 01:13:07.940
Ribbit, can we really do this?

01:13:08.942 --> 01:13:11.011
We've gotta try, Sandy.

01:13:11.013 --> 01:13:14.413
We can't just let things happen,
because they're scary...

01:13:14.415 --> 01:13:16.715
or because they're...
they're bigger than us.

01:13:16.717 --> 01:13:19.352
You be careful, okay?

01:13:19.354 --> 01:13:21.486
You, too.

01:13:21.488 --> 01:13:22.754
Ribbit.

01:13:41.306 --> 01:13:45.140
Hey! Hey, you guys,
don't worry. I'll get you out.

01:13:52.715 --> 01:13:55.449
Ssh... be quiet.

01:13:55.451 --> 01:14:00.121
Well, that's not a nice thing to say
to someone who's here to rescue you.

01:14:05.128 --> 01:14:08.061
Don't make any noise.

01:14:09.462 --> 01:14:11.664
Why? The human already left.

01:14:11.666 --> 01:14:17.869
Maybe it's not the human
they're worried about.

01:14:17.871 --> 01:14:19.070
Kai.

01:14:42.758 --> 01:14:45.127
Your Highness.

01:14:50.632 --> 01:14:54.702
All hail our new queen!

01:15:01.176 --> 01:15:07.547
I present your majesty
with a magical royal elixir.

01:15:07.549 --> 01:15:10.616
Long live the queen!

01:15:11.651 --> 01:15:12.751
Oh, no!

01:15:12.753 --> 01:15:14.553
Oh, yes.

01:15:14.555 --> 01:15:16.621
What are you doing here?

01:15:16.623 --> 01:15:18.623
See this rope?

01:15:18.625 --> 01:15:22.527
I'm a prisoner here
and it's all your fault.

01:15:22.529 --> 01:15:26.364
Going over that waterfall
knocked me out.

01:15:26.366 --> 01:15:30.935
When I came to,
that human had tied me up.

01:15:30.937 --> 01:15:34.537
And now you're going to pay.

01:15:34.539 --> 01:15:35.871
Agh!

01:15:52.787 --> 01:15:54.389
Now go!

01:16:08.501 --> 01:16:09.635
Hah.

01:16:33.357 --> 01:16:34.690
Help!

01:17:07.754 --> 01:17:08.821
Yeah!

01:17:21.467 --> 01:17:22.732
Now what?

01:17:25.036 --> 01:17:27.269
Now we find Ribbit.

01:17:43.752 --> 01:17:46.254
No!

01:17:47.122 --> 01:17:49.156
Huh? Ew.

01:18:00.667 --> 01:18:02.435
Poison.

01:18:02.437 --> 01:18:03.735
Hm. Guards!

01:18:05.539 --> 01:18:08.907
Stop! One move and she's gone.

01:18:33.497 --> 01:18:34.696
Ribbit.

01:18:35.098 --> 01:18:36.898
Ribbit!

01:18:49.377 --> 01:18:51.011
Ribbit.

01:18:51.013 --> 01:18:53.112
Unh.

01:18:53.114 --> 01:18:55.715
Sandy, I drank the...

01:18:56.784 --> 01:18:59.351
Where's the princess?

01:18:59.353 --> 01:19:01.787
She's okay,
but she needs our help.

01:19:01.789 --> 01:19:08.026
Come on, you get the princess
free, I'll take care of Kai.

01:19:20.405 --> 01:19:22.471
Yee-ow!

01:19:46.961 --> 01:19:48.261
Grab him!

01:19:48.263 --> 01:19:50.163
Oh, Your Majesty,
Your Highness!

01:19:50.165 --> 01:19:52.665
Take him away.

01:19:56.135 --> 01:19:58.237
I can't believe it.

01:19:58.239 --> 01:20:00.205
I was almost killed.

01:20:00.207 --> 01:20:03.374
If it weren't for these brave,
little creatures.

01:20:05.144 --> 01:20:07.545
Especially this one.

01:20:11.115 --> 01:20:13.918
How can I ever repay you,
little one.

01:20:16.754 --> 01:20:18.455
Ew!

01:20:21.259 --> 01:20:26.562
But I... I guess... I guess.

01:20:26.564 --> 01:20:28.931
Okay.

01:20:43.745 --> 01:20:46.346
Wait! Wait! Uh, wait!

01:20:46.348 --> 01:20:48.714
Can we try that again?

01:20:52.552 --> 01:20:55.221
Ribbit.

01:20:55.223 --> 01:20:58.189
It was all just a fantasy,
wasn't it?

01:20:58.191 --> 01:21:01.993
It was, it was just the bat,
and his eyes...

01:21:01.995 --> 01:21:03.894
and his voice and...

01:21:03.896 --> 01:21:05.896
I've been such a fool.

01:21:05.898 --> 01:21:10.000
Hah! I'm no prince.

01:21:10.002 --> 01:21:12.635
I'm not even a good frog.

01:21:12.637 --> 01:21:16.105
I've been such an idiot, Sandy.

01:21:16.107 --> 01:21:19.475
Ribbit, does it really matter?

01:21:19.477 --> 01:21:22.444
Frog... prince? Who cares?

01:21:22.446 --> 01:21:25.881
Look at where we've gone,
the things we've done.

01:21:25.883 --> 01:21:32.287
No frog or prince even, can say they've
ever done half the things we've done.

01:21:32.289 --> 01:21:34.188
I... I guess.

01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:36.424
You saved the princess, Ribbit.

01:21:36.426 --> 01:21:40.161
She would have drunk the poison
if it wasn't for you.

01:21:40.163 --> 01:21:44.197
Only you could have saved her without
dying from the poison yourself.

01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:47.667
Yeah, yeah!
I guess you're right.

01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:50.536
I suppose we did travel
a long way.

01:21:50.538 --> 01:21:52.438
And we did rescue the princess.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.574
And I have done things
no frog has ever done before.

01:21:55.576 --> 01:21:59.210
I stopped the evil,
bad guy, I got the girl.

01:21:59.212 --> 01:22:02.914
Oh... I didn't.

01:22:02.916 --> 01:22:06.216
Get the girl, I mean.

01:22:06.218 --> 01:22:08.685
I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

01:22:14.958 --> 01:22:16.392
Huh?

01:22:18.695 --> 01:22:22.130
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:22:28.037 --> 01:22:29.771
So, where did Kai come from?

01:22:29.773 --> 01:22:32.773
He was tied up
in the Witch Doctor's hut.

01:22:32.775 --> 01:22:36.377
Being kept as some kind
of weird pet.

01:22:37.812 --> 01:22:39.011
Huh?

01:22:57.998 --> 01:23:01.165
Bye!

01:23:18.915 --> 01:23:22.584
So, now what?

01:23:24.653 --> 01:23:29.257
Now... we take it
one day at a time.

01:23:29.259 --> 01:23:32.901
Whatever you say... Norman.

01:23:51.883 --> 01:23:54.556
<i>â™ª R-I-B-B-I-T

<i>â™ª Now if you want to travel

01:25:14.897 --> 01:25:19.140
