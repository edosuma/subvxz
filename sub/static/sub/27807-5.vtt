Whoever that was, was very
clear, screaming like, "No!"

40:02.233 --> 40:03.732
They had no interest
in talking to us.

40:03.734 --> 40:06.336
And we were like, "Okay,
now we know where we stand."

40:06.338 --> 40:09.672
We got evidence, but it was
nothing that was bringing us

40:09.674 --> 40:11.407
closer to an answer.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.742
And so, that's why we asked
Chip to come out.

40:13.744 --> 40:18.415
He immediately went to your spot
on the fourth floor.

40:18.417 --> 40:20.150
Yeah.

40:20.152 --> 40:21.750
And he was very clear,

40:21.752 --> 40:24.353
there was something there
very angry and upset.

40:24.355 --> 40:26.489
And then he started
naming names.

40:26.491 --> 40:29.358
He kept saying "Charles,
I keep getting C, C, C,"

40:29.360 --> 40:30.560
over and over again.

40:30.562 --> 40:33.496
So I found a story.

40:33.498 --> 40:36.366
This woman, her husband was
here at Waverly

40:36.368 --> 40:39.035
being treated
for tuberculosis.

40:39.037 --> 40:40.703
She met another man.

40:40.705 --> 40:42.772
That man
ended up killing her.

40:42.774 --> 40:45.374
His name was
Charles Chester.

40:45.376 --> 40:48.110
And his last name
started with a "C.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.245
So...

40:49.247 --> 40:51.114
-Wow.
-Yeah.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.049
It's just too much
of a coincidence for us

40:53.051 --> 40:54.451
to ignore, you know.

40:54.453 --> 40:58.455
You have Chip who knows
absolutely nothing about like,

40:58.457 --> 41:00.990
who would know about this,
right, comes into this --

41:00.992 --> 41:02.258
-I didn't know about it.
-Right.

41:02.260 --> 41:03.526
-And I know --
-And you know everything.

41:03.528 --> 41:04.727
I really didn't think
y'all could come up

41:04.729 --> 41:05.862
with something I didn't know.
-Right.

41:05.864 --> 41:07.997
Not only did he go to
the fourth floor

41:07.999 --> 41:11.934
and walk right to the area,
but to have him --

41:11.936 --> 41:15.004
-You can feel that in here.
-...to have him say the name.

41:15.006 --> 41:18.140
Then you start thinking, okay,
but Charles was not here.

41:18.142 --> 41:19.408
He wasn't at Waverly.

41:19.410 --> 41:22.144
-Right. Right, right, right.
-John was.

41:22.146 --> 41:24.280
And we think John
has just been

41:24.282 --> 41:27.716
harboring that anger
and that resentment.

41:27.718 --> 41:30.019
You know, he's not someone
you can just crossover

41:30.021 --> 41:32.155
and so it's scary --
-He's probably trying to --

41:32.157 --> 41:34.890
been trying to get through
for quite awhile.

41:34.892 --> 41:36.426
Yes, and nobody knew
the story, though.

41:36.428 --> 41:39.562
Making me feel --
you can feel that sadness.

41:39.564 --> 41:43.366
Yeah. As far as John goes on
the fourth floor, he's angry.

41:43.368 --> 41:46.970
We just recommend, when you
have investigators come in,

41:46.972 --> 41:49.105
you make them aware of him.

41:49.107 --> 41:51.574
The more people go up there
and talk to him,

41:51.576 --> 41:54.243
and tell him that they're
sympathetic to him, I think --

41:54.245 --> 41:56.111
-Maybe he can let go.
-Exactly.

41:56.113 --> 41:57.313
I'll try to help him.

41:57.315 --> 41:59.115
-Yeah.
-That really does help a lot.

41:59.117 --> 42:01.450
I mean, again,
that wasn't necessarily,

42:01.452 --> 42:03.319
wasn't our main focus
when we got here,

42:03.321 --> 42:04.620
but it became that.

42:04.622 --> 42:05.988
It really became that.

42:05.990 --> 42:08.390
Well, they made sure
that that was your focus.

42:08.392 --> 42:10.526
-Yeah, they did.
-Yeah. They actually did.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.328
They probably knew
he needed it most.

42:12.330 --> 42:15.198
-He'll let go one day.
-Yes.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.133
BRUNI: This is the exact reason
Adam and I are so adamant

42:18.135 --> 42:21.871
about identifying the spirits
responsible for a haunt.

42:21.873 --> 42:24.340
Their name helps us
tell their story

42:24.342 --> 42:27.010
and in a way,
makes them human again.
