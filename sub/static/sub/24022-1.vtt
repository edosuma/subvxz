01:40.708 --> 01:42.583
I got you.

01:42.666 --> 01:44.000
Guard!

01:44.791 --> 01:45.791
Guard!

01:46.958 --> 01:47.958
I got you.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.500
Come here, you.

01:53.666 --> 01:55.083
Get on your knees.

01:59.208 --> 02:03.125
Are you proud of yourself for saving him?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.750
You’d better mind your own business.

02:11.708 --> 02:14.416
You thought you could get this note out?

02:17.500 --> 02:18.791
What is this?

02:25.333 --> 02:26.333
Look.

02:27.875 --> 02:29.166
What is this?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.750
I’m asking you! What is this?

02:31.833 --> 02:34.083
I don’t speak Japanese.

02:36.583 --> 02:38.416
Throw him in solitary.

02:41.625 --> 02:44.625
Nobody knows that you’re here.

02:45.625 --> 02:47.916
You’ll never get out of here.

04:40.625 --> 04:41.625
Get out of the way.

04:56.041 --> 04:57.041
Food.

05:08.291 --> 05:09.291
Food.

05:34.041 --> 05:35.125
Kiyoshi.

05:38.083 --> 05:39.750
My name is Kiyoshi.

05:48.375 --> 05:49.375
Nick.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.041
I need your help.

06:06.875 --> 06:10.000
When someone tries
to commit suicide in prison,

06:10.541 --> 06:12.208
they take you to the hospital.

06:13.125 --> 06:16.208
Once I am there,
my brothers will come for me.

06:17.750 --> 06:20.958
And then, I will have them come for you.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.250
Okay?

07:27.958 --> 07:29.250
Break is over!

07:29.333 --> 07:31.416
Go back to work.

07:36.375 --> 07:38.166
- Walk!
- Hurry!

07:41.666 --> 07:43.583
Hey! Go!

07:43.666 --> 07:46.125
Hey! Walk fast!

09:27.791 --> 09:31.750
I need you to keep me from dying
and make sure the guards come.

09:49.833 --> 09:51.041
Guard!

09:51.958 --> 09:52.958
Guard!

09:55.625 --> 09:58.458
Hey! Hey!

10:01.416 --> 10:02.833
Help!

10:03.416 --> 10:04.833
Help!

10:04.916 --> 10:07.333
Hey! Hey!

10:11.041 --> 10:12.708
Help!

10:13.375 --> 10:15.458
- Be quiet.
- He cut himself!

10:15.541 --> 10:18.500
Number 129. Emergency!

10:18.583 --> 10:20.958
Ring the emergency bell!

10:22.833 --> 10:24.416
Number 129. Emergency!

10:24.500 --> 10:25.708
Emergency!

10:25.791 --> 10:27.791
The emergency bell!

10:33.458 --> 10:36.083
Move… forward!

10:36.583 --> 10:40.458
One, two. One, two. One, two.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.625
- Move!
- Go to work!

14:15.041 --> 14:16.583
The entire Shiromatsu family

14:16.666 --> 14:21.208
would like to start by thanking you
for what you did for our member.

14:26.500 --> 14:27.875
Do you speak Japanese?

14:29.041 --> 14:30.041
A bit.

14:33.875 --> 14:37.166
Kiyoshi says we should offer you a job.

14:40.291 --> 14:43.833
We have a problem
with one of your fellow Americans.

14:48.833 --> 14:51.541
We have tried to reason with him
for a while now.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.291
Maybe…

14:54.458 --> 14:56.458
you could help us with that.

14:58.208 --> 14:59.541
Yeah, maybe I could.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Good.

15:19.583 --> 15:21.000
Wow, Mr. Gaijin.

15:21.083 --> 15:23.916
Come visit us. We’ll give you a discount.

15:35.916 --> 15:38.583
Try this. Welcome!

16:02.083 --> 16:03.250
Wait here.

16:25.875 --> 16:27.375
Get some sleep at an inn.

16:27.458 --> 16:29.333
Someone will pick you up tomorrow.

16:30.625 --> 16:31.666
Wait for them.

16:46.208 --> 16:47.833
Hey, cowboy.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.041
American beer?

16:53.916 --> 16:55.083
It’ll be 100.

16:56.416 --> 16:57.666
One hundred?

16:59.083 --> 17:00.083
Yeah.

17:02.166 --> 17:05.040
Okay.

17:07.540 --> 17:08.750
You’re pretty good.

17:10.583 --> 17:11.833
Hold on a second.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.290
Here.

17:16.125 --> 17:17.125
Thanks.

17:18.958 --> 17:19.958
Beer?

17:29.041 --> 17:30.684
Can’t believe you punched that guy.

17:30.708 --> 17:33.628
- See the way he looked at me?
- He was a little out of line.

17:33.666 --> 17:35.250
- Right.
- Let’s make some money.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.208
All right.

17:36.291 --> 17:38.208
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.041
- Park over there.
- Yes, sir.

19:36.416 --> 19:37.708
Good luck.

20:01.250 --> 20:03.166
Let’s go over to Mr. Panetti’s office.

20:10.666 --> 20:11.750
Mr. Panetti?

20:12.250 --> 20:14.916
I got a guy out here,
says he’s here about a contract.

20:19.791 --> 20:21.000
Just give him a minute.

20:35.541 --> 20:37.583
Look,
I’m sure you got respect for these people

20:37.666 --> 20:40.041
because they wear silk pajamas

20:40.125 --> 20:44.000
and they bow like you’re the fuckin’
sun god when they pour the coffee.

20:44.083 --> 20:47.791
Frankly, I don’t give a shit
about their rules or their traditions

20:47.875 --> 20:50.958
or whatever the fuck it is
that you’re here to try to explain to me.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.458
We won!

20:53.791 --> 20:55.791
What’s the point in winning a war

20:55.875 --> 20:59.375
if now you gotta worry
about steppin’ on Japs’ toes?

20:59.458 --> 21:02.125
- I wouldn’t call ’em Japs.
- Okay.

21:02.916 --> 21:04.916
- So you’re one of those.
- One of what?

21:05.583 --> 21:07.875
I got a deal with the United States Army.

21:08.500 --> 21:12.666
Your fuckin’ country gives me metal
at two cents a cubic yard.

21:12.750 --> 21:14.583
Do you know
where they get this metal from?

21:15.666 --> 21:16.750
Any idea?

21:17.416 --> 21:20.666
They get it
from breaking down war machines

21:20.750 --> 21:24.166
that these fucking Nips built
to sneak attack us.

21:25.291 --> 21:29.583
So excuse me
if they gotta buy it back from me cheap.

21:31.041 --> 21:34.250
Now, I don’t know
if you’re bangin’ some slanty-eyed broad

21:34.333 --> 21:36.958
and you’re gettin’ all gooked-out
and sympathetic,

21:37.041 --> 21:38.375
but that’s the way it is.

21:40.083 --> 21:42.583
- That’s the way it is?
- That’s the way it is.

21:42.666 --> 21:45.458
And now,
you can get the fuck outta my office.

22:11.625 --> 22:13.541
He’s all bloody.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.333
Did you kill him?

22:23.833 --> 22:24.916
He’ll live.

22:26.666 --> 22:27.708
Let’s go.

23:08.375 --> 23:10.666
Brother,
recently I’ve been doing some impressions.

23:10.750 --> 23:12.333
- Let me see.
- May I?

23:17.208 --> 23:18.750
It’s a worm.

23:18.833 --> 23:21.500
And now… two worms.

23:23.208 --> 23:26.375
That’s not funny.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.583
You can’t say it’s not funny.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.875
Nick. Your turn.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.750
A penguin walks into a bar.

23:41.791 --> 23:43.583
Says to the bartender…

23:45.583 --> 23:47.375
“Hey, have you seen my brother?”

23:50.541 --> 23:53.125
Bartender looks at the penguin and says…

23:56.666 --> 23:57.875
“What’s he look like?”

24:06.416 --> 24:09.000
A penguin walks into a bar
and asks the bartender,

24:09.083 --> 24:11.208
“Have you seen my brother?”

24:11.791 --> 24:14.125
“What’s he look like?”
“A penguin, of course.”

24:15.166 --> 24:16.375
Everyone, laugh.

24:17.125 --> 24:20.000
Laugh. Whatever it means, laugh.

24:20.833 --> 24:22.250
Laugh, laugh.

24:26.708 --> 24:28.750
Shit, it’s them.

24:29.916 --> 24:31.208
It’s the Seizu family.

24:31.791 --> 24:33.851
They’d better go back to Kobe.
This is our city.

24:33.875 --> 24:36.416
Hey, you, calm down. Sit down.

24:38.250 --> 24:39.625
What do you want?

24:41.208 --> 24:42.791
Smart move.

24:42.875 --> 24:44.958
This is our territory. Go home.

24:45.458 --> 24:47.541
The Yankee warehouse,
think you can get away with it?

24:47.625 --> 24:50.208
We made a deal with the GIs, not you.

24:50.291 --> 24:51.750
The warehouses are ours now.

24:51.833 --> 24:54.083
Hey, handsome, listen up.

24:54.583 --> 24:57.750
You came in here and talked to us,
like your boss told you to.

24:57.833 --> 24:59.375
That’s impressive.

25:00.208 --> 25:03.291
We’ll pass it on, if we don’t forget.

25:04.291 --> 25:08.458
I hear your family made a deal
with the Americans,

25:09.041 --> 25:11.708
but that won’t make this port yours.

25:11.791 --> 25:12.833
Get it?

25:14.208 --> 25:15.958
You expect me to take you seriously

25:16.041 --> 25:18.291
with this little white kitten
at your table?

25:20.625 --> 25:24.208
Oh, ho! You have a cute face.

25:24.916 --> 25:27.333
Then why don’t you take him home
and pet him?

25:28.625 --> 25:30.083
No, you keep her.

25:30.916 --> 25:32.375
You haven’t heard the news in town?

25:33.291 --> 25:35.708
The name Shiromatsu means nothing anymore.

25:37.375 --> 25:39.458
Your boss is half-retired.

25:40.041 --> 25:41.833
He’s blind to what’s coming.

25:41.916 --> 25:42.958
Shut up.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.250
It’s true.

25:45.333 --> 25:47.958
If your boss and our previous boss weren’t
on good terms,

25:48.041 --> 25:49.291
I would destroy your family.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
It’s the other way around, idiot.

25:52.916 --> 25:54.916
Next, we will take your women.

25:55.541 --> 25:56.541
Go home.

25:57.208 --> 26:00.333
We’ll take your dirty balls
while we’re at it.

26:01.541 --> 26:03.833
Just like we took your port
before you knew it.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Go home.

26:17.958 --> 26:19.458
Go back to Kobe.

26:21.166 --> 26:22.541
Let them go.

26:23.875 --> 26:24.875
Get lost!

26:25.541 --> 26:27.041
Don’t come back, fool.

26:28.875 --> 26:30.125
I’m going.

26:47.791 --> 26:49.291
Where are the dancers?

26:49.375 --> 26:50.375
Dance!

26:51.791 --> 26:54.458
Dance! Let’s start drinking again.

26:56.750 --> 26:57.750
Cheers.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Cheers.

29:49.208 --> 29:50.416
Whose place is this?

29:51.416 --> 29:53.750
Yours, if you want it.

29:59.583 --> 30:00.625
It’s nice.

30:21.250 --> 30:22.250
Think about it.

30:24.833 --> 30:27.833
There’s a suit in the closet.
Should fit you.

32:17.833 --> 32:19.666
Let me join you.

32:22.833 --> 32:24.041
How much?

32:26.333 --> 32:28.541
Why isn’t anyone saying anything?

32:29.750 --> 32:31.833
- Who is in charge? You?
- No.

32:31.916 --> 32:34.083
I’m asking who’s in charge.

32:34.666 --> 32:35.833
You?

32:37.416 --> 32:38.416
Is it him?

32:45.125 --> 32:46.500
What’s your name?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.166
Kimura.

32:49.250 --> 32:50.958
So you’re Kimura.

32:52.166 --> 32:54.041
Nick. Kimura.

32:55.583 --> 32:57.083
I want to ask you.

32:57.666 --> 33:00.916
If my friend Nick was looking
to play cards in Osaka,

33:01.000 --> 33:02.541
should he ask you?

33:03.791 --> 33:06.208
I don’t work with Americans.

33:07.208 --> 33:08.458
Don’t be bossy.

33:08.958 --> 33:10.416
Who are you?

33:10.500 --> 33:14.041
You have a family in the Osaka docks?
Are you the boss?

33:15.166 --> 33:16.375
I don’t know.

33:20.083 --> 33:21.791
Who owns Osaka?

33:27.166 --> 33:29.375
I’m asking you. Who owns Osaka?

33:30.583 --> 33:32.166
I wanna hear it.

33:34.250 --> 33:35.375
Who is it?

33:36.583 --> 33:37.958
Who owns Osaka?

33:38.625 --> 33:39.791
The Shiromatsu.

33:40.458 --> 33:41.541
Say it again.

33:41.625 --> 33:44.375
- Shiromatsu.
- Wrong. Say it once more.

33:44.458 --> 33:45.500
Shiromatsu.

33:45.583 --> 33:47.041
It’s “Mr. Shiromatsu.”

33:48.333 --> 33:49.333
Stand up.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.583
Sato let me use this place.

33:56.666 --> 33:59.666
We’ve been friends with Sato
since the old days.

33:59.750 --> 34:04.875
I hear you threatened to tell his wife
that he’d slept with one of his actresses.

34:04.958 --> 34:07.125
He got her pregnant.

34:07.208 --> 34:08.916
It’s your child.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.041
She says you raped her.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.625
Hey. It’s over for today. Off you go.

34:17.416 --> 34:20.041
If you have any debts,
pay them to Akihiro Shiromatsu.

34:20.541 --> 34:22.666
Never play in Osaka without paying.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.000
Hurry up and get out.

34:30.750 --> 34:31.583
Now.

34:31.666 --> 34:33.791
- I’ll pay if you want money.
- Pay.

34:34.458 --> 34:37.791
How much is the Shiromatsu’s usual cut?
I’ll pay double.

34:37.875 --> 34:38.875
Okay, pay.

34:40.333 --> 34:42.750
He wants to know what Shiromatsu’s cut is.

34:42.833 --> 34:47.041
Can’t you even negotiate
without permission from your white dog?

34:54.041 --> 34:55.625
Are you okay?

34:56.458 --> 34:58.333
Don’t make such a fuss.

34:58.916 --> 35:00.541
Aren’t you being dramatic?

35:05.458 --> 35:06.791
Don’t weep.

35:07.708 --> 35:10.083
This is what happens
when you resist the Shiromatsu.

35:58.041 --> 36:00.083
Why is he still hanging around here?

36:01.166 --> 36:02.166
What do you mean?

36:03.000 --> 36:05.916
That gaijin has already served
his purpose, hasn’t he?

36:06.333 --> 36:09.333
Why? He doesn’t mean shit to me.

36:09.416 --> 36:10.416
You sure?

36:11.958 --> 36:13.458
Don’t worry. It’s fine.

36:13.541 --> 36:17.250
What’s fine?
I’m asking you if you owe him a debt.

36:17.333 --> 36:18.916
And I said no.

36:19.625 --> 36:20.625
Listen, Kiyoshi.

36:21.541 --> 36:24.333
He doesn’t care about you or this family.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Send him away.

36:29.208 --> 36:30.208
Okay?

36:36.916 --> 36:38.583
He doesn’t like me very much, does he?

36:41.041 --> 36:42.916
What’s the story with his fingers?

36:45.083 --> 36:48.916
When you dishonor your boss
and you want to show remorse,

36:49.000 --> 36:50.250
you give your finger.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.666
It’s called otoshimae.

36:55.250 --> 36:56.833
I see you’ve got all your fingers.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.000
I guess I got lucky.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.291
- I’ll go down there now.
- Yes, sir.

37:09.125 --> 37:10.250
Stay here.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.333
What?

37:50.416 --> 37:51.708
That’s enough.

37:56.208 --> 37:58.125
Wait. Stop it!

38:01.916 --> 38:03.416
I get it. Let me go.

38:04.291 --> 38:05.833
What are you doing here?

38:06.416 --> 38:08.416
What does it look like? I’m dancing.

38:08.500 --> 38:11.458
- I told you not to come here.
- Why? What’s wrong?

38:11.541 --> 38:13.791
- No reason. Just go home.
- No.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.708
Don’t test me.

38:16.541 --> 38:20.250
What would you do if the Seizu men
walked in with guns in their hands?

38:20.333 --> 38:22.000
Why would they come? Where are they?

38:22.083 --> 38:24.833
I’m saying what if they came?

38:26.500 --> 38:27.500
Nick.

38:27.541 --> 38:30.125
Take my sister home. She’s drunk.

38:38.750 --> 38:41.333
That’s enough. He’s taking you home.

38:42.750 --> 38:43.750
Go home.

39:48.416 --> 39:50.916
Thank you for taking me home.

39:51.958 --> 39:52.958
Yeah.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.833
Um…

39:58.416 --> 40:00.333
I’m gonna close the door now.

40:03.791 --> 40:05.125
You’re very beautiful.

40:08.125 --> 40:09.208
Thank you.

40:10.750 --> 40:11.833
You’re welcome.

40:14.958 --> 40:16.791
- You want to come inside?
- Yes.

40:58.375 --> 40:59.458
Morning.

41:07.583 --> 41:08.708
I should go.

41:11.208 --> 41:12.291
You should.

42:03.958 --> 42:07.625
Orochi says the US Army is shipping guns
back to the States.

42:07.708 --> 42:10.791
Their plan is to sell some of it
before it leaves the port.

42:13.083 --> 42:16.125
The US Army cannot know
that the Shiromatsu is involved.

42:17.333 --> 42:18.416
Makes sense.

42:18.958 --> 42:21.041
You will have to do this on your own.

42:22.791 --> 42:24.333
I understand if you won’t do this,

42:24.416 --> 42:27.416
but if it goes right,
everything will change.

42:30.375 --> 42:31.458
And if it goes wrong?

42:32.208 --> 42:35.125
It will come down on you and no one else.

42:36.541 --> 42:37.791
Sounds like fun.

44:19.583 --> 44:20.750
You hear that?

44:25.125 --> 44:28.000
This is our water. This is our port.

44:28.458 --> 44:31.333
Your dead friend knew that very well.

44:31.416 --> 44:36.000
He said you’d sneak in tonight
to buy all the guns before us.

44:50.125 --> 44:52.208
Your skin is so soft.

44:53.125 --> 44:54.625
Should I lick it?

44:55.750 --> 44:58.125
Brother, I can’t find it.

44:59.166 --> 45:00.500
Where is the money?

45:05.291 --> 45:07.000
Where is the money?

45:17.166 --> 45:18.416
Shoot him.

45:20.416 --> 45:22.416
Burn the truck afterwards.

45:24.708 --> 45:25.708
Kneel down.

45:39.458 --> 45:41.333
- Lower the gun.
- Brother…

45:41.833 --> 45:43.083
Lower the gun!

45:56.958 --> 45:58.166
The guns?

46:00.625 --> 46:02.625
- Where are the guns?
- I don’t know.

46:19.041 --> 46:20.166
Father, I apologize.

46:21.041 --> 46:22.333
It was my idea.

46:24.166 --> 46:28.166
Two Seizu men are dead!

46:30.541 --> 46:33.500
It was my idea, not his. I killed them.

46:35.833 --> 46:37.625
Speak Japanese…

46:38.625 --> 46:39.875
or I’ll cut your throat!

46:47.250 --> 46:50.208
If you kill him,
you’ll have to kill me first.

46:50.291 --> 46:52.750
Are you choosing this gaijin
over your family?

46:53.333 --> 46:55.208
Who warned the Seizu?

46:55.791 --> 46:58.708
We brought two million yen in cash.

46:58.791 --> 47:00.458
But the Seizu didn’t find it.

47:03.875 --> 47:07.666
In other words,
someone told them where it would be.

47:08.208 --> 47:09.208
Isn’t that so?

47:09.291 --> 47:11.583
Nick put it under the engine block.

47:12.041 --> 47:13.958
They only looked under the seats.

47:14.041 --> 47:17.625
What’s going on? This could’ve only
happened if someone told them.

47:18.666 --> 47:20.333
Who sent you?

47:24.250 --> 47:26.541
I sent him.

47:27.791 --> 47:32.250
Osaka is ours,
and I sent him to make a statement.

47:33.333 --> 47:34.541
Are you…

47:35.583 --> 47:36.958
the new boss?

47:41.416 --> 47:43.875
Are you the new boss?

49:01.458 --> 49:02.916
He fucked Miyu.

49:04.041 --> 49:06.916
That night when you asked him
to take her home.

49:07.666 --> 49:11.291
He is no different from the Seizu.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.708
He takes what he wants.

49:18.250 --> 49:19.750
Wait outside.

49:35.666 --> 49:37.500
Please allow me to do the same.

50:01.500 --> 50:02.500
Good.

50:36.833 --> 50:37.833
Father.

50:40.833 --> 50:42.375
The Shiromatsu man is here.

51:42.833 --> 51:44.875
Can that man still be trusted?

51:45.458 --> 51:46.458
Yes.

51:46.958 --> 51:48.125
It’s still fine.

52:16.041 --> 52:17.791
Who is the traitor?

52:20.250 --> 52:21.458
I don’t know.

52:25.750 --> 52:27.833
If you knew, would you tell me?

52:31.333 --> 52:32.541
Yes.

55:12.041 --> 55:14.041
You have no family.

55:15.166 --> 55:16.458
You have no home.

55:17.250 --> 55:20.083
You are a stray dog.

55:20.875 --> 55:22.375
But today…

55:23.583 --> 55:25.250
you may have a home.

55:28.041 --> 55:29.416
You have to decide.

55:30.958 --> 55:32.833
You can drink and join me…

55:34.125 --> 55:36.291
or you can stand here, outside.

55:56.208 --> 55:57.208
Nick.

55:58.458 --> 56:00.708
Grab the sakazuki and take it.

56:10.708 --> 56:13.708
From this auspicious moment,
they have become father and son.

56:14.291 --> 56:16.916
Everyone, we will now clap.

56:18.916 --> 56:20.166
Ready.

56:21.791 --> 56:23.791
Congratulations.

57:09.541 --> 57:11.208
She’s 28 years old.

57:11.291 --> 57:14.916
She can meet whoever she wants,
marry whoever she wants.

57:16.500 --> 57:17.625
But not me.

57:18.541 --> 57:19.541
Not yakuza.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.500
The people here, they cannot love anyone.
You understand?

57:26.500 --> 57:29.000
What if I promised you she’d be safe
with me?

57:29.791 --> 57:31.666
What if I told you that before the war,

57:31.750 --> 57:34.208
four men killed Akihiro’s wife
and his son?

57:34.791 --> 57:36.375
Akihiro found them and for three days,

57:36.458 --> 57:39.500
he kept them alive,
begging for their deaths, their mothers,

57:39.583 --> 57:43.125
while he cut off everything
that identified them as human beings.

57:46.333 --> 57:47.708
Yakuza can never have that.

57:48.291 --> 57:50.291
To become a yakuza is a choice.

57:51.583 --> 57:55.166
You trade one type of family for another.
You can never go back.

57:56.375 --> 57:58.166
So why does she work for you?

57:58.250 --> 58:00.250
So I can watch her, keep her safe.

58:02.291 --> 58:04.875
I have many brothers, but only one sister.

58:06.208 --> 58:07.583
She was a virgin.

58:09.625 --> 58:11.208
I don’t think so.

58:14.833 --> 58:16.166
Don’t see my sister.

58:21.916 --> 58:23.250
Congratulations.

58:24.166 --> 58:25.875
Now we are real brothers.

58:31.500 --> 58:33.375
Thank you for visiting us.

58:39.791 --> 58:41.833
- Let’s go.
- Yes, sir.

01:00:07.125 --> 01:00:09.541
Do you know what your tattoo means?

01:00:11.166 --> 01:00:12.625
Do you know what it means?

01:00:14.416 --> 01:00:15.666
It’s a fable.

01:00:17.125 --> 01:00:20.916
The koi fish who can swim up a waterfall

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:23.083
becomes a dragon.

01:00:24.833 --> 01:00:26.208
It means you’re arrogant.

01:00:31.916 --> 01:00:33.541
What do your tattoos mean?

01:00:35.041 --> 01:00:36.041
What?

01:00:37.125 --> 01:00:38.541
- Mine?
- Yeah.

01:00:40.833 --> 01:00:44.000
Do you get the same one as me?

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:47.875
- You have two koi fish.
- I do.

01:00:47.958 --> 01:00:49.333
One swimming up…

01:00:50.458 --> 01:00:52.083
and one swimming down.

01:00:55.666 --> 01:00:56.958
I understand.

01:00:57.541 --> 01:00:59.750
You do? Tell me.

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:02.958
Well…

01:01:05.333 --> 01:01:10.541
I guess, in life,
sometimes we fight the current.

01:01:12.083 --> 01:01:13.333
And other times…

01:01:15.958 --> 01:01:18.083
it’s important to flow with the river.

What’s the deal?

01:02:44.666 --> 01:02:46.541
Young man, just a little longer.

01:02:49.041 --> 01:02:50.708
It’s time to go.

01:02:51.416 --> 01:02:53.916

Seizu tells me
he has a business proposition,

01:05:13.375 --> 01:05:17.500
but he doesn’t have the respect
to meet in person.

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:20.750
He sends a kid like you…

01:05:22.666 --> 01:05:24.083
and this gaijin.

01:05:26.041 --> 01:05:30.250
Do I look like a radio salesman?

01:05:31.291 --> 01:05:33.458
I’m not selling you radios.

01:05:34.083 --> 01:05:35.375
I’m selling you stock.

01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:39.000
In ten years,
they’ll be making more than radios.

01:05:40.041 --> 01:05:42.625
After the IPO,
they’ll be pouring money into research.

01:05:42.708 --> 01:05:44.166
TV, automobile technology…

01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:46.250
They have a subsidiary in the US.

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:49.291
Good for them.

01:05:50.208 --> 01:05:51.750
Where is Seizu?

01:05:52.583 --> 01:05:53.583
He’s in Kobe.

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:56.875
He offers you this opportunity
for a joint venture.

01:05:57.625 --> 01:06:00.875
He offers me…

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:03.166
indignity.

01:06:05.041 --> 01:06:09.416
Seizu wants my family to come
under his command, and not only that…

01:06:10.791 --> 01:06:14.541
he wants me to pay you?

01:06:14.625 --> 01:06:16.375
I am just a representative.

01:06:17.291 --> 01:06:20.333
And we’re talking about ten percent
of millions in dividends.

01:06:20.416 --> 01:06:21.416
In US dollars.

01:06:22.666 --> 01:06:26.166
With 400,000 shares, we could make
500 million yen in ten years.

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:29.625
All the Kobe families are participating
in this investment.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.500
Are we in Kobe?

01:06:34.541 --> 01:06:39.125
I will not come under the command
of Hiromitsu Seizu.

01:06:39.208 --> 01:06:41.500
He doesn’t have the guts to pay me…

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:45.625
but he sends me this college grad boy…

01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:51.083
to beg for my money.
Not to a man like that.

01:06:52.666 --> 01:06:55.791
I’m just saying
this sounds like a smart investment.

01:06:56.375 --> 01:07:00.166
Let’s have the non-Japanese
leave the room. You, leave.

01:07:01.791 --> 01:07:03.375
Nick, get out.

01:07:09.958 --> 01:07:11.958
You should go home, brother.

01:07:12.291 --> 01:07:15.291
Why? You know I’m right.

01:07:15.375 --> 01:07:17.250
It’s not for us to decide.

01:07:17.958 --> 01:07:20.458
Father doesn’t want a war against Seizu.

01:07:21.375 --> 01:07:23.250
He’ll bow to him all day long.

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:25.958
He’ll offer our fingers,

01:07:26.541 --> 01:07:30.000
but then he spits at Seizu’s money
for his honor.

01:07:30.791 --> 01:07:34.083
He’s stuck in the old ways.

01:07:34.166 --> 01:07:38.291
You really think
he should share investments with Seizu?

01:07:38.375 --> 01:07:40.833
He would rather die.

01:07:40.916 --> 01:07:43.333
If you don’t take it, someone else does.

01:07:43.416 --> 01:07:45.208
You’re too drunk.

01:07:45.291 --> 01:07:48.000
Yeah, I’m drunk. So what?

01:07:49.458 --> 01:07:51.375
My head still works fine.

01:07:52.166 --> 01:07:54.166
Stay, brother.

01:07:54.958 --> 01:07:57.375
You and I never really talked.

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:00.125
You see that guy?

01:08:02.083 --> 01:08:05.250
When I was little, I didn’t go to school.

01:08:06.375 --> 01:08:07.583
I worked.

01:08:09.458 --> 01:08:11.708
One day, I walk home…

01:08:12.916 --> 01:08:17.457
and a chinpira, a wannabe gangster,
puts a knife at my throat.

01:08:18.082 --> 01:08:20.957
He takes my money, 200 yen.

01:08:21.625 --> 01:08:23.875
I go home to my father.

01:08:24.625 --> 01:08:27.166
He’s drunk. Angry.

01:08:27.832 --> 01:08:29.666
He takes his glass.

01:08:33.332 --> 01:08:35.332
I bleed every fucking place.

01:08:35.916 --> 01:08:36.957
I run.

01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:40.666
I run all the way to the river, crying.

01:08:42.332 --> 01:08:43.791
A boy comes to me.

01:08:44.291 --> 01:08:47.500
He says his name is Kiyoshi.

01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:51.832
He walks with me
back to my father’s house.

01:08:52.332 --> 01:08:54.332
He takes a metal pipe.

01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:57.416
He breaks my father’s head.

01:08:58.875 --> 01:09:01.291
From that day, I am yakuza.

01:09:01.875 --> 01:09:03.041
And Kiyoshi,

01:09:03.582 --> 01:09:05.166
he is my brother.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.250
And now…

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:14.666
You understand?

01:09:16.082 --> 01:09:17.082
Gaijin.

01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:21.625
You understand my English?

01:09:23.457 --> 01:09:24.457
Huh?

01:09:28.916 --> 01:09:30.250
That’s enough. Go home.

01:09:34.875 --> 01:09:36.707
Whatever you say, brother.

01:09:51.707 --> 01:09:53.750
Sorry, he’s busy.

01:09:53.832 --> 01:09:55.673
- Move aside.
- He’s busy.

01:10:20.708 --> 01:10:22.833
You’ve turned into a beautiful woman.

01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:30.375
To whom do you owe becoming such a beauty?

01:10:34.625 --> 01:10:35.666
Hmm?

01:10:42.041 --> 01:10:43.875
- What’s this?
- Don’t touch me.

01:10:44.958 --> 01:10:46.791
- Try and stop me.
- Stop it.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.875
I’m not the same person I used to be.

01:10:51.708 --> 01:10:52.833
Me neither.

01:10:56.875 --> 01:10:58.208
What are you doing here?

01:11:02.708 --> 01:11:04.375
I missed our times together.

01:11:07.708 --> 01:11:09.833
We were over a long time ago.

01:11:13.041 --> 01:11:14.083
I know.

01:11:20.958 --> 01:11:22.208
Lonely, aren’t you?

01:11:26.416 --> 01:11:28.541
You can’t hide what’s inside your heart.

01:11:31.416 --> 01:11:32.500
You…

01:11:33.958 --> 01:11:36.125
- You still care about me.
- Stop it.

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.666
Why do you tell me to stop? You like this…

01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:40.833
No.

01:11:41.791 --> 01:11:42.791
Stop.

01:11:46.416 --> 01:11:48.250
You wanna be a whore?

01:11:49.666 --> 01:11:51.583
That white bastard’s whore?

01:11:53.791 --> 01:11:56.541
Why do you like him? Tell me.

01:11:56.625 --> 01:11:57.666
Huh?

01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:59.250
What does he have that I don’t?

01:12:00.125 --> 01:12:01.125
Tell me!

01:12:04.333 --> 01:12:07.041
You think he’s going to protect you?

01:12:08.416 --> 01:12:10.125
Is that what you really think?

01:12:11.666 --> 01:12:15.291
If that’s the case,
I will make you a whore.

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:18.541
Like every bitch around here.

01:12:19.833 --> 01:12:24.166
No, no, stop it! Let me go!

01:12:39.375 --> 01:12:40.541
Sorry.

01:12:43.458 --> 01:12:44.458
Sorry.

01:14:57.083 --> 01:14:58.125
It’s the Shiromatsu.

01:15:34.666 --> 01:15:39.208
I heard you were insulted
by my representative’s offer.

01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:43.833
I was insulted by you.

01:15:44.916 --> 01:15:46.791
You think I have no respect.

01:15:47.708 --> 01:15:50.708
I respect you more than you think.

01:15:51.625 --> 01:15:53.416
Let me speak with respect.

01:15:55.666 --> 01:15:59.333
I’m offering to build a fence around you…

01:16:01.208 --> 01:16:04.500
to invite you into my garden.

01:16:05.083 --> 01:16:06.875
There, you can retire…

01:16:07.958 --> 01:16:09.166
and live for years.

01:16:10.083 --> 01:16:12.625
What about my family members?

01:16:13.791 --> 01:16:15.916
They can join my family.

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.583
They can do as they please.

01:16:20.333 --> 01:16:24.166
As long as they do not form
any new family in Osaka.

01:16:29.041 --> 01:16:31.208
You call this…

01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:35.833
an offer of respect?

01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:41.166
You understand nothing
about your father’s generation.

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:46.000
We are wolves.

01:16:47.125 --> 01:16:48.375
We’re not dogs.

01:16:48.875 --> 01:16:52.958
Can you keep wolves inside a fence?

01:17:06.666 --> 01:17:08.666
Careful on your way back to Kobe.

01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:50.750
Nick?

01:18:51.875 --> 01:18:53.791
Nick fuckin’ Lowell?

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.291
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:19:00.333 --> 01:19:03.375
- Wow.
- You look fuckin’ good for a dead man.

01:19:04.041 --> 01:19:05.625
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:19:05.708 --> 01:19:08.791
Hey, it’s me. It’s Paulie.
Just on weekend leave.

01:19:10.583 --> 01:19:12.000
Let me buy you a drink.

01:19:13.083 --> 01:19:15.083
You got somewhere you need to be?

01:19:15.791 --> 01:19:19.000
Or you got five minutes for an old friend,
Captain?

01:19:30.958 --> 01:19:32.458
Congratulations.

01:19:34.083 --> 01:19:35.500
It’s bullshit.

01:19:35.583 --> 01:19:37.458
Three years in Okinawa.

01:19:37.875 --> 01:19:40.416
There’s no one fighting anymore,
so what’s the point of this?

01:19:41.875 --> 01:19:43.166
I don’t know.

01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:45.875
You ever go out there?
Where they dropped the first one?

01:19:45.958 --> 01:19:47.000
No.

01:19:48.125 --> 01:19:49.125
I did.

01:19:50.666 --> 01:19:53.416
The fuckin’ rats
almost built it all up again.

01:19:56.291 --> 01:19:57.625
Look at you.

01:19:57.708 --> 01:19:59.750
Looks like made
a good fuckin’ life for yourself,

01:19:59.833 --> 01:20:01.666
dressed up like a lounge singer.

01:20:05.458 --> 01:20:08.333
You live here? Osaka?

01:20:10.083 --> 01:20:11.166
I got a little place.

01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:19.333
You weren’t always so calm and quiet.
You know that?

01:20:21.291 --> 01:20:23.541
Maybe you just didn’t know me so well.

01:20:25.083 --> 01:20:26.500
No, I guess not.

01:20:29.083 --> 01:20:31.833
I got leave for another day.
I should come by, see your place.

01:20:36.541 --> 01:20:37.541
No.

01:20:38.708 --> 01:20:40.416
- No?
- No.

01:20:43.291 --> 01:20:44.541
Your five minutes is up.

01:20:47.333 --> 01:20:49.750
- Is that how it is, huh?
- Yeah.

01:20:49.833 --> 01:20:52.416
Can’t drink with a guy
from your own fuckin’ unit.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.625
Congrats on your stripes.

01:21:02.708 --> 01:21:04.916
Yeah? Hey, fuck you.

01:21:06.541 --> 01:21:09.833
If I didn’t know better,
I’d say you were dodging court-martial.

01:21:10.416 --> 01:21:14.250
Can’t wait to hear what the guys are gonna
say when I tell them who I bumped into.

01:21:14.333 --> 01:21:17.083
I’m sure someone would love
to come pay you a visit.

01:21:19.916 --> 01:21:22.583
No, you know what? I’m sorry.

01:21:23.875 --> 01:21:24.875
Wow.

01:21:31.291 --> 01:21:33.500
Why don’t you come back
and have a drink with me?

01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:36.833
Old times.

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.791
You can see half of Osaka from here.

01:21:50.583 --> 01:21:51.750
Not bad, huh?

01:21:59.875 --> 01:22:01.125
Americans.

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:03.875
I still got a couple contacts.

01:22:04.375 --> 01:22:05.375
Cheers.

01:22:06.041 --> 01:22:07.250
Old times’ sake.

01:22:07.333 --> 01:22:08.416
Old times’ sake.

01:22:14.208 --> 01:22:15.208
Listen.

01:22:15.833 --> 01:22:17.666
I know you’re not in the army anymore,

01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:20.375
and I can see you got
a good thing going here.

01:22:23.958 --> 01:22:25.541
Man, I always liked you.

01:22:27.041 --> 01:22:31.250
Don’t worry. Okay?
Your secret’s safe with me.

01:22:31.333 --> 01:22:33.041
Thank you. I appreciate that.

01:22:34.458 --> 01:22:35.875
All right.

01:22:41.208 --> 01:22:42.416
Jesus, man.

01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:43.916
I mean…

01:22:46.333 --> 01:22:47.375
Yeah.

01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:51.333
You like whiskey?

01:22:52.166 --> 01:22:53.166
Yeah.

01:22:54.041 --> 01:22:55.958
I have got a surprise for you.

01:22:57.916 --> 01:22:59.166
Do your best.

01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:13.666
- I’m sorry.
- What?

01:24:09.166 --> 01:24:10.166
Miyu.

01:24:20.791 --> 01:24:21.791
Miyu?

01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:41.708
Are you okay? Hey.

01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:44.125
- Hey.
- Just…

01:24:49.875 --> 01:24:51.250
Who did this to you?

01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:53.833
- Just go.
- Who did this to you?

01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:05.125
There’s a baby in me.

01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:11.166
There’s a baby in me.

01:25:16.666 --> 01:25:17.750
It’s ours.

01:25:21.708 --> 01:25:22.708
Who hurt you?

01:25:27.333 --> 01:25:29.833
It doesn’t matter who did this to me.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.041
Just leave it.

01:25:37.333 --> 01:25:39.708
Maybe you want to protect me…

01:25:42.125 --> 01:25:43.833
but I don’t want that.

01:25:49.916 --> 01:25:50.958
Do you get it?

01:25:54.333 --> 01:25:56.375
I’ve been fine my whole life.

01:26:00.291 --> 01:26:01.541
I’m fine with it.

01:26:51.083 --> 01:26:52.083
Who’s there?

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:56.583
Who’s there?

01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:02.750
Nick.

01:27:05.875 --> 01:27:07.083
I betrayed you.

01:27:13.333 --> 01:27:14.833
She’s gonna have a kid.

01:27:21.125 --> 01:27:23.333
You want me to leave? I’ll leave.

01:27:25.208 --> 01:27:26.500
You say the word.

01:27:29.833 --> 01:27:31.333
You leave my sister…

01:27:32.583 --> 01:27:33.791
with your child?

01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:35.958
Is that who you are?

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:42.500
I don’t know.

01:27:46.125 --> 01:27:47.291
Get inside.

01:28:50.791 --> 01:28:51.958
Hang on.

01:29:09.416 --> 01:29:11.125
You know what these are?

01:29:16.375 --> 01:29:17.875
They were my father’s.

01:29:18.583 --> 01:29:20.291
He left our home when I was young.

01:29:20.875 --> 01:29:22.333
My sister was a baby.

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:25.708
The day he left, he was drunk,

01:29:26.666 --> 01:29:29.333
and he came to me in the night with these.

01:29:31.416 --> 01:29:32.541
And he said,

01:29:33.250 --> 01:29:34.958
“This is daisho.

01:29:35.041 --> 01:29:37.250
One for war, one for honor.

01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:40.083
One to kill, one to decapitate.

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:43.166
One for murder, one for suicide.”

01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:46.041
Katana and wakizashi.

01:29:48.333 --> 01:29:51.541
This never left a warrior’s side,
even in his sleep.

01:29:52.208 --> 01:29:53.541
It was his honor.

01:29:55.041 --> 01:29:57.958
My father told me the daisho was mine now.

01:29:58.458 --> 01:30:01.833
Because I was the one
with a family to look after. My sister.

01:30:16.166 --> 01:30:18.666
She’s yours to protect now.

01:30:22.208 --> 01:30:23.375
You understand?

01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:28.125
If you are my brother, take them.

01:30:40.791 --> 01:30:41.791
What?

01:30:43.583 --> 01:30:45.166
There’s just one other thing.

01:30:46.416 --> 01:30:47.416
What is it?

01:30:56.541 --> 01:30:57.541
That will do.

01:31:05.833 --> 01:31:06.833
Okay.

01:31:16.583 --> 01:31:18.958
- Thank you.
- You’re welcome, brother.

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:32.875
Thanks to you, I’m now in a conflict
with my father’s childhood friend.

01:31:33.416 --> 01:31:36.166
Do you know what the other families think?

01:31:38.125 --> 01:31:40.208
Does it look like I’m in control?

01:31:41.875 --> 01:31:45.208
Hey. I’m talking to you. Look at me.

01:31:49.875 --> 01:31:53.750
The Shiromatsu family is broken.
They pose no threat.

01:31:56.250 --> 01:31:57.958
Trust me.

01:31:59.833 --> 01:32:02.125
You don’t need to get your hands dirty.

01:32:33.958 --> 01:32:36.083
Welcome, Mr. Shiromatsu.

01:32:37.833 --> 01:32:39.208
I’m all yours.

01:32:39.291 --> 01:32:40.625
Please come in.

01:33:14.416 --> 01:33:15.625
It’s a beautiful day.

01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:19.250
Beautiful day.

01:34:04.375 --> 01:34:05.375
Father.

01:34:07.375 --> 01:34:08.500
Get in, Nick.

01:34:12.041 --> 01:34:14.708
What’s going on? Where is Orochi?

01:34:15.291 --> 01:34:16.500
What the hell?

01:34:16.583 --> 01:34:18.916
We will circle the streets
until we find them.

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.000
Please duck down.

01:34:22.083 --> 01:34:23.375
Fuck.

01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:31.958
Are you okay?

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:38.500
Kiyoshi.

01:34:39.458 --> 01:34:41.458
Kiyoshi. Kiyoshi.

01:34:42.125 --> 01:34:44.208
No. Oh, jeez.

01:34:52.958 --> 01:34:54.208
Brother.

01:35:01.375 --> 01:35:02.416
It’s okay.

01:35:05.125 --> 01:35:06.166
It’s okay.

01:35:36.958 --> 01:35:42.000
Orochi, Yasushi, Banjo, Shuichi,

01:35:42.708 --> 01:35:46.250
Ryuhei, Taro, Ichiro,

01:35:47.125 --> 01:35:50.166
Kazuo, Yuta, Eiichi.

01:35:52.666 --> 01:35:58.083
That car was full of Seizu,
not our people.

01:35:58.166 --> 01:35:59.583
Orochi!

01:35:59.666 --> 01:36:01.708
You can’t be sure.

01:36:06.291 --> 01:36:08.500
A fifth of our men have betrayed us.

01:36:11.375 --> 01:36:13.333
We cannot go to war with Seizu.

01:36:14.333 --> 01:36:16.083
We cannot win this!

01:36:16.833 --> 01:36:18.625
It doesn’t matter who wins.

01:36:21.791 --> 01:36:24.375
You should care who wins.

01:36:27.125 --> 01:36:33.125
They will send the killers into hiding
in Kyoto, Nara, Tokyo.

01:36:33.791 --> 01:36:35.375
Now is not the time.

01:36:37.833 --> 01:36:38.916
Then…

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.250
when is the time?

01:36:43.375 --> 01:36:47.291
This is for your sake too.
Don’t you get it?

01:36:52.416 --> 01:36:53.750
Is this war?

01:36:58.333 --> 01:36:59.833
Is this war?

01:37:02.791 --> 01:37:04.250
Is this war?

01:37:06.666 --> 01:37:07.666
Nick.

01:37:07.708 --> 01:37:09.750
Miyu is outside. You should go to her.

01:38:25.208 --> 01:38:27.541
You’re making me hard.

01:38:27.958 --> 01:38:30.208
You like this kind of thing, right?

01:38:31.125 --> 01:38:32.375
Where are you going?

01:38:37.291 --> 01:38:39.041
You fucking gaijin.

01:38:39.125 --> 01:38:40.250
That’s right.

01:39:13.958 --> 01:39:15.000
Hey, stop.

01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:41.000
What is it?

01:39:46.583 --> 01:39:49.833
I have a message from the Seizu's boss.

01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:54.416
Please come tomorrow to the port factory,
which is neutral territory,

01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:55.833
with no guns.

01:39:56.333 --> 01:39:58.375
He said he wants to end the war.

01:40:00.166 --> 01:40:05.375
He sent you here to tell me this?

01:40:06.208 --> 01:40:07.291
Yes.

01:40:07.875 --> 01:40:08.875
Thank you.

01:40:10.125 --> 01:40:11.291
You can leave now.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.166
He told me to bring back your response.

01:40:15.291 --> 01:40:17.166
Right now?

01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:18.875
Yes.

01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:31.666
Understood.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.250
I will meet him.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Father.

01:41:36.083 --> 01:41:37.875
I know you are here!

01:41:39.041 --> 01:41:42.250
Get out here now
and show me your dirty face.

01:41:48.916 --> 01:41:50.416
What are you doing?

01:41:52.125 --> 01:41:53.625
I’m here!

01:41:55.416 --> 01:41:56.541
Here!

01:42:00.583 --> 01:42:02.500
You are a stubborn old man.

01:42:02.958 --> 01:42:04.208
A tough one.

01:42:04.708 --> 01:42:06.250
I’ll give you that.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.083
You killed many of my most important men.

01:42:11.083 --> 01:42:13.083
What do you want?

01:42:13.166 --> 01:42:16.000
I don’t want anything from you.

01:42:17.208 --> 01:42:20.333
But I have someone here who might.

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:02.833
Orochi.

01:43:05.916 --> 01:43:08.208
You are my son.

01:43:09.958 --> 01:43:11.750
It’s not too late.

01:43:13.458 --> 01:43:14.750
Come back.

01:43:38.208 --> 01:43:39.666
I wanted to.

01:44:05.083 --> 01:44:06.541
My son.

01:44:29.250 --> 01:44:31.333
The Shiromatsu family no longer exists.

01:44:32.916 --> 01:44:35.416
The head of the Seizu is a generous man.

01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:37.375
He wants all of you to live.

01:44:39.166 --> 01:44:40.416
For you…

01:44:41.166 --> 01:44:45.458
I can offer you peace if you leave Osaka
and your woman behind.

01:44:46.125 --> 01:44:49.500
We make no promises for her safety
if you stay.

01:44:54.541 --> 01:44:57.000
Do you accept?

01:45:01.166 --> 01:45:03.083
You’re all idiots.

01:45:06.708 --> 01:45:08.500
You are a traitor.

01:45:09.083 --> 01:45:10.583
- Fight me.
- Takeshi.

01:45:11.125 --> 01:45:12.125
Fight me.

01:45:12.958 --> 01:45:14.083
Fight me!

01:45:14.166 --> 01:45:15.625
Orochi!

01:46:10.291 --> 01:46:12.416
Get out!

01:47:03.875 --> 01:47:04.875
What...

01:47:06.833 --> 01:47:08.208
Shh.

01:47:11.666 --> 01:47:12.958
Akihiro.

01:47:15.041 --> 01:47:16.041
He’s dead. He’s gone.

01:47:18.541 --> 01:47:21.166
Orochi, he killed him.

01:47:22.333 --> 01:47:25.833
Now, you pack a bag and we go together.

01:47:26.458 --> 01:47:27.458
Yes?

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.500
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:47:30.583 --> 01:47:33.833
Now get your things, and we leave.

01:47:33.916 --> 01:47:35.666
Now. Now.

01:48:04.166 --> 01:48:05.166
Hello?

01:48:08.166 --> 01:48:09.166
Nick.

01:48:11.708 --> 01:48:12.708
Yeah.

01:48:14.916 --> 01:48:15.916
Yeah.

01:48:16.791 --> 01:48:18.083
Yes, of course.

01:50:26.416 --> 01:50:29.916
You!

01:50:54.208 --> 01:50:55.375
Look at me.

01:50:58.958 --> 01:51:00.291
What do you want?

01:51:04.541 --> 01:51:07.166
I want you to allow me…

01:51:08.875 --> 01:51:09.875
to kill him.

01:51:14.875 --> 01:51:16.125
Give this warrior a weapon

01:51:16.208 --> 01:51:20.708
and let him show us
how strong and brave he really is.

01:51:24.375 --> 01:51:26.166
What do you have to fear...

01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:29.500
brother?

01:51:41.625 --> 01:51:43.625
You walk into my home.

01:51:44.625 --> 01:51:48.166
You take my brother,
you poison my father’s mind.

01:51:48.750 --> 01:51:50.250
Poison him against me.

01:51:50.791 --> 01:51:53.416
Someone has to put out the fire.

01:51:56.291 --> 01:51:59.291
You think you are a yakuza with this?

01:52:00.375 --> 01:52:02.000
You aren’t a yakuza.

01:52:02.541 --> 01:52:05.791
You are a gaijin. Outsider.

01:52:05.875 --> 01:52:08.500
You are just the way my brother found you.

01:52:10.583 --> 01:52:11.583
Get up.

01:52:15.208 --> 01:52:16.208
Get up!

01:52:23.625 --> 01:52:26.500
No. I won’t fight you.

01:52:38.666 --> 01:52:40.041
Don’t shoot!

01:53:04.708 --> 01:53:06.500
Go now. Go.
