SHE LAUGHS

00:51.000 --> 00:53.640
Jo, PLEASE speak to the gardener.
I haven't seen him for days.

00:53.640 --> 00:55.600
Because he quit.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.160
Oh, not another one. Why?

00:58.160 --> 01:00.520
I told him he was a lazy bugger.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.520
Benedict, you've got to stop
treating the staff like this.

01:03.520 --> 01:05.880
I can do what I want, Squeak.

01:05.880 --> 01:08.920
Josephine,
will you prepare dinner for nine?

01:08.920 --> 01:10.680
Make sure the whole family's there,

01:10.680 --> 01:13.560
and that there's plenty of
champagne. We're celebrating.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.160
Yes, sir.

01:15.160 --> 01:17.120
Benedict, wait!

01:17.120 --> 01:20.640
Don't you think that any decision
about the plantation's future

01:20.640 --> 01:22.680
should be discussed with
the whole family?

01:22.680 --> 01:24.680
It will. At dinner.

01:30.720 --> 01:34.560
Dad would've been proud I kept
his dream alive for so long, and

01:34.560 --> 01:37.920
that Paradise Skies Coffee is still
a household name in the Caribbean.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.960
But now is the right time to
say goodbye.

01:40.960 --> 01:45.040
So, if you'll raise your glasses
to Paradise Skies.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.560
To Paradise Skies.

01:48.560 --> 01:49.800
Paradise Skies.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.120

03:35.240 --> 03:36.920
Come on! Come on, Colin!
You can do it!

03:36.920 --> 03:38.000
He's going to make it.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.800
Come on.
You haven't let us down all night.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.120
Focus!

03:41.120 --> 03:43.320
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes!

03:43.320 --> 03:46.800
Come on! Yes, yes, yes! Yeah!

03:48.520 --> 03:51.040
Sir? Don't worry, Florence.

03:51.040 --> 03:53.000
It's really not how it looks.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.520
Sounds like you two had fun.

03:56.520 --> 04:00.000
Oh, that crab racing is the sport of
kings, Florence. It was fantastic!

04:00.000 --> 04:01.760
Patrice introduced me to everybody.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.360
Real little community
they've got going there.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.600
Would've have stayed longer,
only duty calls.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.880
So, what've we got here, JP?

04:13.880 --> 04:17.680
We've got a male, mid-50s,
was found dead in his swimming pool.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.560
Any inkling as to what happened?

04:19.560 --> 04:22.120
A bullet through the heart, sir.
One shot.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.360
Hmm, that'll do it.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.280
We've got a friendly
neighbourhood spy up there.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.040
See any more of these
on your travels, JP?

04:27.040 --> 04:29.200
Yup, three cameras
on the property in all, sir.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.320
We're just waiting for the footage.

04:31.320 --> 04:34.280
Who's the victim?
Benedict Dacre, sir.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.440
The Coffee King.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.120
You must have heard the jingle.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.240
# Whoa, wake up to Paradise Skies

04:40.240 --> 04:41.720
# It's a bright new day

# Tis a sunshine glory

SHE LAUGHS

04:48.160 --> 04:50.760
Are you serious?
I'm more of a tea man myself.

04:57.600 --> 04:58.920
So what time was he killed?

04:58.920 --> 05:02.040
Well, the house guests say they
heard the shot around midnight, sir.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.320
Any sign of the murder weapon?

05:03.320 --> 05:06.000
No, but the victim kept
a gun in his study.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.280
Some kind of family heirloom.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.480
Let me guess. It's gone missing?
Yup!

05:12.000 --> 05:14.040
This is an exit wound.
Shot in the back.

05:14.040 --> 05:17.680
And the bullet went
straight through him.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.720
So...

05:19.720 --> 05:21.960
he was standing around here
by the pool.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.800
Shot in the back, he fell in.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.880
Bullet must be over in that area.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.280
Can't have gone far.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.280
Hmm, what do we have
over here, then?

05:35.160 --> 05:36.400
Brandy.

05:38.160 --> 05:39.480
But only the one glass.

05:40.520 --> 05:42.800
Clearly he wasn't socialising.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.640
His family said
he read every night alone.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.240
Napoleon The Great.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.440
Not exactly light reading.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.480
Hmm.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.440
Something wrong with the book, sir?

05:58.440 --> 06:02.440
Not with the book itself, Florence.
It's more what's missing from it.

06:02.440 --> 06:03.560
There's no bookmark.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.320
Not a single corner of any page
turned down.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.760
How did Mr Dacre keep his place?

06:11.760 --> 06:15.720
Maybe he just started the book and
never got a chance to mark his page.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.200
Well, maybe we should bag it anyway.
Just in case.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.240
OK, why don't you two
look for the bullet?

06:20.240 --> 06:23.040
Florence -
we should round up the house guests.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.320
I think it's time
we had a chat with the Dacre family.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.360
You're Benedict's wife? Yes.

06:31.360 --> 06:35.280
We were married a week
and a half ago. Impeccable timing.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.160
OK, right.

06:37.160 --> 06:42.200
Um, now, it seems to me
that Mr Dacre was a man of ritual.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.880
I understand he liked to read
outside by the pool after dinner.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.600
Yes, come rain or shine.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.120
Same time. Same drink. Same cigar.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.880
Some dull old history book, mostly.

06:55.760 --> 06:59.440
And sorry, Mrs Dacre, where were you
when you heard the gunshot?

06:59.440 --> 07:02.000
In the lounge, getting wasted
with everyone else.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.360
Not everyone else.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.160
Auntie Ciss wasn't there.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.000
Oh, I erm...
I, I felt a migraine coming on.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.320
So, I, I went to bed.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.600
And you were in bed
when you heard the shot?

07:15.600 --> 07:17.400
The noise woke me up.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.920
What about you, Miss Porter?

07:24.600 --> 07:26.880
I was in my bungalow
around the back of the house.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.800
Away from everything.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.200
So let me get this right.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.840
Not one of you was anywhere near
Benedict when that shot was fired?

07:35.680 --> 07:37.560
It seems not.

07:37.560 --> 07:40.400
I'm sure the CCTV will tell us
the same story.

07:40.400 --> 07:43.640
Inspector, the CCTV is not
working, I'm afraid.

07:43.640 --> 07:47.240
No, we got it fixed.
Yesterday morning.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.320
Good. Great. Thank you, Josephine.

07:49.320 --> 07:53.040
DRUMMING FINGERS

07:53.040 --> 07:55.920
Something bothering you there,
Mrs Dacre?

07:55.920 --> 07:58.600
So this is what they call
old-fashioned British reserve.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.880
Well, I'll just go straight ahead
and say it, then.

08:00.880 --> 08:05.440
Ciss said Benedict should be
killed for selling this place
at dinner last night.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.320
Paradise Skies. Dad would not
have been proud of you.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.360
Speak up, Squeak. I can't hear you.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.080
I said Dad wouldn't have
been proud of you.

08:12.080 --> 08:13.600
He'd have killed you for doing this.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.840
Well, he isn't here.

08:14.840 --> 08:16.360
That's not true!

08:16.360 --> 08:19.120
It was just a...a stupid argument.

08:19.120 --> 08:21.800
So who's going to kill me now? You?

08:23.600 --> 08:24.880
It's all right, darling.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.400
I just, erm, I...

08:27.400 --> 08:30.400
I simply reminded my brother

08:30.400 --> 08:33.600
that he had no right to sell our
home without consulting us first.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.120
No, he had EVERY right.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.880
You just love playing the victim,
don't you, Ciss?

08:40.679 --> 08:42.679
OK, well...
HE CLEARS THROAT

08:42.679 --> 08:45.840
..just one last question.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.520
Did Benedict ever use a bookmark?

08:48.520 --> 08:50.720
Er... I...

08:53.680 --> 08:55.560
I don't...I don't know, sorry.

08:56.680 --> 08:58.440
Are we done here, Inspector?

08:58.440 --> 09:00.560
We are. For now.

09:00.560 --> 09:01.720
Thank you.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.240
I'd say Christmas is
a blast in this house.

09:09.440 --> 09:13.120
So, are you bringing Rosie
to Florence's big day?

09:13.120 --> 09:14.480
Er, yep.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.680
That'll bring back happy memories
for you two, right?

09:17.680 --> 09:18.720
Mmm-hmm.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.440
Can you guess
how many jobs I've had?

09:24.440 --> 09:26.680
Er, I don't know. Erm, three?

09:26.680 --> 09:28.040
13, including this one.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.400
Hairdresser. Hand model.
Security guard.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.600
Photography assistant. Tequila girl.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.040
It's an interesting CV, Ruby.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.880
Thing is, after a week in all those
jobs, I could tell you everything

09:36.880 --> 09:39.880
about my colleagues, from their
family tree to their favourite tune.

09:39.880 --> 09:43.000
But all I know about you is that
you take one sugar in your tea.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.520
So let's play a game.
We both get five questions each,

09:45.520 --> 09:48.640
and we can ask each other
anything we want. Anything?

09:48.640 --> 09:51.560
I'm an open book.
Just turn my pages.

09:51.560 --> 09:52.800
You first, JP.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.480
Um...

09:57.560 --> 10:00.080
What's your favourite...?

10:00.080 --> 10:01.120
Bullet.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.600
Well, that's a pretty niche
question, JP!

10:03.600 --> 10:05.040
No.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.320
Bullet.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.360
Well, there's nothing on the pool.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.960
Let's run the others,
from about 11:30.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.920
Found a bullet, sir. And the gun.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.360
It was in the bushes too,
just by the main path.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.400
The bullet was where
you said it would be, sir.

10:22.920 --> 10:24.760
That's a nasty little toy.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.640
It's fresh.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.760
Definitely been fired
in the last 12 hours.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.120
Sir, you need
to take a look at this.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.800
It's the camera
at the back of the house.

10:38.120 --> 10:40.600
That's Ciss Dacre with
the gun in her hand. Look!

10:41.720 --> 10:44.480
The direction she's heading,
it leads to the swimming pool.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.880
The other house guests

10:45.880 --> 10:48.920
said they heard the gunshot around
midnight. What time was this?

10:48.920 --> 10:50.240
11:52.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.880
She thought the CCTV was broken.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.480
That she couldn't be seen.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.080
KNOCK ON DOOR

11:03.080 --> 11:05.120
Please leave me alone.

11:05.120 --> 11:07.800
I'm afraid we can't do that,
Miss Dacre.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.760
You see, we've studied the footage,

11:09.760 --> 11:12.960
and it shows you walking towards
the pool with a gun in your hand,

11:12.960 --> 11:14.440
just before your brother was shot.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.760
This is ridiculous. I told you
I was in bed when it happened.

11:18.880 --> 11:20.640
This is your robe?

11:20.640 --> 11:22.600
Yes. Of course it is. Why?

11:22.600 --> 11:25.680
We have to take it away
and test it for gunshot residue.

11:25.680 --> 11:28.600
I was nowhere near the pool
when the gun was fired.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.960
This is absurd.

11:29.960 --> 11:33.080
Ciss Dacre, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.280
Inspector...

11:38.280 --> 11:40.760
..do you really think
I killed my brother?

11:40.760 --> 11:42.440
Well, then explain this.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.760
It's you walking towards the pool,

11:44.760 --> 11:47.440
minutes before
Benedict was murdered.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.640
I can't.

11:54.520 --> 11:59.040
OK. We have actual video evidence
of our killer holding the gun.

11:59.040 --> 12:01.440
She walks towards
the scene of the murder,

12:01.440 --> 12:03.600
just a few minutes
before it happened.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.160
But you don't believe it.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.040
It's convenient, don't you think?

12:07.040 --> 12:08.680
Well, the camera doesn't lie.

12:08.680 --> 12:10.280
No, but it can mislead.

12:10.280 --> 12:12.680
She's the only one without an alibi.

12:12.680 --> 12:14.240
Not just her. The housekeeper.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.440
Josephine?

12:15.440 --> 12:18.120
She said she was in the bungalow
alone at the time of the shooting.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.840
That hasn't been corroborated.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.560
I saw a look between her and Ciss
when they were being questioned.

12:23.560 --> 12:26.640
Like she was surprised
Ciss would say what she said.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.200
You think Josephine
knows more than she's saying?

12:31.200 --> 12:33.520
Well, let's see if I can find out.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.880
It's probably time you called
your lawyer, Miss Dacre.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.920
Or you could simply tell me
what you're hiding from us?

12:46.920 --> 12:49.360
I'm not hiding anything, Inspector.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.000
Maybe I should ask Josephine?

12:54.440 --> 12:56.240
I wasn't...

12:56.240 --> 12:59.360
I wasn't in my bedroom
when I heard the gunshot last night.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.760
I'd already left it...

13:01.760 --> 13:05.280
..to go to Josephine's bungalow.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.800
Why not say this before?

13:08.800 --> 13:11.360
It's private.
Between me and Josephine.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.280
I'm not here to judge, Miss Dacre.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.080
I love Josephine. I always have.

13:23.160 --> 13:24.720
And my, er...

13:25.760 --> 13:27.760
..my father was very old-fashioned.

13:27.760 --> 13:30.920
And Benedict didn't
fall far from the tree.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.440
There's always been a right way
of doing things in my family,

13:33.440 --> 13:35.640
and I was scared
of doing anything wrong.

13:37.680 --> 13:38.840
Sorry.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.080
SHE SOBS

13:40.080 --> 13:42.160
You are the, er...

13:42.160 --> 13:46.680
You're... You're the first
person I've ever told.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.080
It's true.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.680
We are partners.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.200
For some time now.

13:58.200 --> 14:01.560
You know she could have been
charged with murder, Miss Porter?

14:01.560 --> 14:04.360
And do you know
how ridiculous that is?

14:04.360 --> 14:08.280
Murder? There is a reason
Benedict called her "Squeak".

14:09.800 --> 14:12.960
Look, Ciss was even
married for a few years,

14:12.960 --> 14:14.760
trying to be a "good" Dacre.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.120
That's when she had Owen.

14:16.120 --> 14:19.600
And I made a promise to her
back then that I would not
tell anyone about us.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.960
I guess telling a lie is all I know.

14:21.960 --> 14:26.800
So, what time did Ciss
come to your bungalow?

14:26.800 --> 14:28.640
It was just before midnight.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.560
She was in a bad way.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.720
It had been a long and a hard day.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.400
I made her some cocoa
whilst she had a shower.

14:40.360 --> 14:42.640
And then we heard the gunshot.

14:46.960 --> 14:51.080
This is not how I wanted
people to find out about us.

14:51.080 --> 14:54.640
I used to dream of going to dinner
with Ciss, hand in hand,

14:54.640 --> 14:56.520
with the whole damn family
there to see us.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.800
Would have been worth it, just to
see the look on her brother's face.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.880
If you'll excuse me?

15:12.800 --> 15:14.480
She's back.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.640
You're joking?
Why have they released her?

15:32.400 --> 15:35.000
RUBY SINGS

15:36.320 --> 15:38.320
# It's a bright new day

15:38.320 --> 15:40.280
♪ Tis the sunshine glory. ♪

15:40.280 --> 15:41.880
Nice work, Ruby!

15:41.880 --> 15:43.080
Thank you, sir!

15:44.280 --> 15:46.240
Right, ladies and gent,

15:46.240 --> 15:49.000
we are literally
back to the drawing board.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.560
So, let's go from the top
on this one. Yep.

15:51.560 --> 15:54.520
Benedict Dacre was found
face down in the pool,

15:54.520 --> 15:56.800
having been shot
through the heart, here.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.720
His sister is Ciss Dacre.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.160
AKA "Squeak".

16:00.160 --> 16:03.760
Squeak worked for her brother
until she was 18.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.680
And she was our prime suspect,
until...

16:06.680 --> 16:10.480
Until Josephine Porter, Ciss'
partner, gave her a solid alibi.

16:10.480 --> 16:13.200
They were both at the bungalow
when the shot was fired.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.440
Meanwhile, the rest of
the house guests claim

16:15.440 --> 16:18.920
they were getting hammered in the
dining room of the main house, here.

16:18.920 --> 16:21.160
But, to confuse matters,
we have CCTV footage

16:21.160 --> 16:24.240
of what looks like Ciss Dacre,
walking towards

16:24.240 --> 16:27.040
the scene of the crime just
a few minutes before it happened,

16:27.040 --> 16:28.400
with a gun in her hand.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.480
Except we now know Ciss was
with Josephine in the bungalow

16:31.480 --> 16:32.760
at the time of the shooting.

16:32.760 --> 16:35.600
Meaning, if this isn't Ciss Dacre,
then someone

16:35.600 --> 16:38.560
has gone to a lot of trouble
to make us think it is.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.240
So, who the hell is it?

16:40.240 --> 16:42.600
And why did they
not only want Benedict dead,

16:42.600 --> 16:44.880
but his own sister
out of the picture as well?

16:44.880 --> 16:47.160
We need to enhance this CCTV image.

16:47.160 --> 16:50.000
Maybe there's a clue as to who it is
pretending to be Ciss Dacre.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.320
I used to work at a photo
processing lab.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.840
I'm sure they can help us out.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.040
Great, and as you can see,
the suspect is pretty well

16:56.040 --> 16:57.960
covered up in that robe there.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.040
So why don't you focus on the hand?

17:00.040 --> 17:01.480
I'll see what we can do.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.480
What about our suspects?

17:03.480 --> 17:05.880
Let's start with
our American friend,

17:05.880 --> 17:07.880
and the victim's wife, Ricki Dacre.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.359
34 years old.
Works in real estate.

17:10.359 --> 17:13.440
Met Benedict Dacre at a physical
therapy clinic in Barbados

17:13.440 --> 17:16.040
about a year ago, after
she'd suffered a back injury

17:16.040 --> 17:18.359
from a car crash.
Were married two weeks ago.

17:18.359 --> 17:20.079
The others believe it was her idea

17:20.079 --> 17:22.160
for Benedict
to sell the plantation.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.280
I ran a quick financial
check on her, sir.

17:24.280 --> 17:27.599
She had a regular income up to a few
months before she married Benedict.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.480
Big money? Substantial enough.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.680
I'm just waiting for the employment
agency to tell me

17:31.680 --> 17:33.120
exactly who she was working for.

17:34.240 --> 17:37.280
And what about
Benedict's daughter, Ruth?

17:37.280 --> 17:39.040
28. An only child.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.400
Tried to be an actress,
but that didn't work out.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.280
She moved back to the estate
over a year ago.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.440
Something of a social media junkie.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.600
Any boyfriends?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.960
It seems she has an on-off
boyfriend called Manu.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.720
He worked at the plantation.

17:52.720 --> 17:55.240
And what about this young man,
Owen Dacre?

17:55.240 --> 17:57.160
Do we have anything on him?

17:57.160 --> 17:59.000
Er, nothing much, sir.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.120
He just finished
boarding school in England,

18:01.120 --> 18:03.760
and spends every summer holiday
working on the plantation.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.120
Do we know what the plantation
was being sold for?

18:06.120 --> 18:07.720
Er, yeah, hold on.

18:07.720 --> 18:08.840
Sorry.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.520
Yep, er... 6 million, sir.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.800
Oh, that could buy you
a whole heap of shoes.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.000
Quite a motive in itself, too.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.280
Let's check the will,
see who benefits the most.

18:19.280 --> 18:23.360
Yes, sir. So if someone is
pretending to be Ciss Dacre,

18:23.360 --> 18:25.280
what would
they need to play the part?

18:25.280 --> 18:27.080
A wig. And a good one, too.

18:27.080 --> 18:30.960
And a green robe.
Exactly the same as Ciss Dacre's.

18:30.960 --> 18:34.480
So, if our impersonator
disposed of the disguise somewhere

18:34.480 --> 18:37.320
on the Paradise Skies Estate,
it's still got to be there, right?

18:37.320 --> 18:40.880
JP, Ruby, why don't you search
the estate high up and low down?

18:40.880 --> 18:43.720
Try and find us this wig and robe.
Yes, sir.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.880
# Whoa, whoa,

18:49.880 --> 18:52.840
♪ It's a bright new day,

18:52.840 --> 18:54.240
Ruby! Please stop, OK?

18:54.240 --> 18:55.800
What? It's a catchy tune.

18:56.880 --> 19:00.960
Wow! This place looks like
it hasn't been used in years.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.840
Which makes it the perfect place
to stash something.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.280
Right, back to the game.
Question number two,

19:07.280 --> 19:08.880
and don't hold back.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.320
Erm, OK.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.880
What's the most embarrassing
thing you've ever done?

19:15.880 --> 19:18.640
Oh, I hope you have a strong
constitution, because

19:18.640 --> 19:22.240
this story begins with a goat,
and ends with me getting arrested.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.000
I'm sorry.
Did you just say arrested?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.400
Mmm-hmm.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.960
Really? You can?

19:33.280 --> 19:35.240
OK, see you later.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.120
Just a wild guess here.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.160
That was Patrice? Yes.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.760
He's managed to get
cover at the bar tonight,

19:42.760 --> 19:44.840
so we're going to check out
the wedding venue.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.640
Oh, fantastic. Where is it?

19:46.640 --> 19:48.160
It's a place up in the hills.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.400
It's where my mother
and father were married. Really?

19:50.400 --> 19:53.680
Well, that sounds perfect.
It's just beautiful.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.240
Morning, Inspector.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.920
Commissioner!

19:58.600 --> 20:00.120
Morning to you, sir.

20:03.960 --> 20:07.200
Are we making progress
at the Paradise Skies Estate?

20:07.200 --> 20:10.000
Well, it's early days, sir,
but we're getting there.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.920
Benedict Dacre always had
a somewhat unpleasant reputation.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.200
You knew him?

20:16.200 --> 20:18.960
We met at the occasional
corporate gathering.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.600
Rather full of himself,
I always found,

20:21.600 --> 20:25.040
pumped up with his own
self-importance. Really?

20:27.760 --> 20:29.600
Much as I enjoy
our little catch-ups...

20:30.760 --> 20:32.440
..I'm here on other business.

20:34.040 --> 20:35.880
What do you know about crabs?

20:37.160 --> 20:39.800
Crustaceans? Eight legs,

20:39.800 --> 20:41.640
delicious with butter.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.680
I'm talking
about the racing variety.

20:44.680 --> 20:47.080
There's been a marked rise

20:47.080 --> 20:49.760
in illegal crab racing
in bars across the island.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.200
Crab racing?

20:52.280 --> 20:53.880
Did you know it was going on?

20:53.880 --> 20:57.160
Well, "know" is
a bit of a strong word.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.680
I may have had a whiff,
or a whisper...

20:59.680 --> 21:01.520
Just a whiff of a whisper.

21:01.520 --> 21:05.320
It's unlicensed gambling,
which is tax evasion.

21:05.320 --> 21:08.840
My superiors take
these things very seriously.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.120
They want it stamped out.

21:11.120 --> 21:13.560
Absolutely, sir. I'm on it.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.080
Stamp on the crabs.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.840
I mean, not literally, of course!

21:16.840 --> 21:18.240
Quick little beggars.

21:18.240 --> 21:19.520
So I've heard.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.000
Thank you, Inspector.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.360
How's my niece doing?

21:29.760 --> 21:31.800
She's barely put a foot wrong, sir.

21:42.560 --> 21:46.600
Ruby, does your uncle know
you were arrested on Guadeloupe?

21:46.600 --> 21:48.280
No. Why would I tell him that?

21:48.280 --> 21:52.400
Because you can't be a police
officer with a criminal record.

21:52.400 --> 21:54.840
Well, then he definitely
doesn't need to know.

21:54.840 --> 21:59.800
But Ruby, this is a serious
breach of police rules.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.280
You could be in
proper trouble for this.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.760
Well, I won't tell if you don't, JP.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.400
No. No, no, no, no, no, OK?

22:06.400 --> 22:09.080
Don't... Don't ask me
to keep secrets, OK?

22:09.080 --> 22:12.600
I hate keeping secrets.
Please, JP, I'm asking as a friend.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.080
Cross your heart.

22:15.480 --> 22:16.520
JP?

22:19.320 --> 22:22.200
Why didn't you tell me
crab racing was illegal?

22:22.200 --> 22:25.720
No, it's not illegal to take part,
just for bars to host it.

22:25.720 --> 22:29.120
OK, I'll get JP to call all
the bars, tell them it has to stop.

22:29.120 --> 22:31.400
Well, then the crab racers
will have nowhere to go.

22:32.840 --> 22:34.720
Oh, we've got
the postmortem through.

22:34.720 --> 22:38.520
Benedict was killed by
a single shot through the heart.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.360
The bullet severed his aorta.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.720
He died instantly.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.640
But there is more.

22:45.720 --> 22:48.800
Scarring from a recent
knife wound to the upper arm.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.800
So somebody had attacked him
previously.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.800
Not exactly Mr Popular, is he?

22:52.800 --> 22:56.040
But if he'd got a wound like that,
he'd have gone to hospital.

22:58.680 --> 22:59.800
Thank you.

22:59.800 --> 23:03.640
So, it was Ruth who brought
her father into A&E.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.800
It says the wound was accidental.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.320
The doctor said that
Ruth was distraught about it.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.680
But Benedict refused
to get the police involved.

23:10.680 --> 23:14.160
Sir, I've been checking out
the family's social media,

23:14.160 --> 23:16.120
and I found this on Ruth's.

23:16.120 --> 23:20.040
Photos a few days before
Benedict received the knife injury.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.840
So, this is boyfriend Manu.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.800
"The happiest day of my life".

23:23.800 --> 23:26.280
I wonder why it was so special.

23:26.280 --> 23:30.000
Then, two days after the stabbing,

23:30.000 --> 23:31.680
she posted this.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.240
"My heart is broken.
No-one understands.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.200
"I hate my father".

23:38.200 --> 23:40.240
Sounds like Daddy didn't approve.

23:40.240 --> 23:43.000
She hated him enough
to stab him in the arm?

23:43.000 --> 23:46.200
An argument that got out of hand?
About Manu?

23:46.200 --> 23:49.200
Well, why don't we ask Ruth just how
she really got on with her father?

24:05.800 --> 24:07.520
He was using a ticket.

24:07.520 --> 24:08.840
A ticket?

24:08.840 --> 24:11.120
Yeah, to mark his place in the book.

24:11.120 --> 24:12.280
Right.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.800
Tell me, did your father like Manu?

24:19.800 --> 24:21.480
I'm not sure he liked anyone.

24:21.480 --> 24:24.560
Well, I mean, did he approve of him?

24:26.120 --> 24:28.240
He simply gave me an allowance
and left me alone.

24:28.240 --> 24:30.320
We've seen the photos
of you and Manu.

24:30.320 --> 24:31.760
It looked pretty serious.

24:31.760 --> 24:34.880
What does it matter?
That's ancient history now.

24:34.880 --> 24:39.000
One of your posts said it was
the happiest day of your life.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.800
Did Manu propose to you?

24:40.800 --> 24:41.960
No.

24:41.960 --> 24:45.040
You know, that look on your face
right now tells me you're lying.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.800
He did propose, didn't he?

24:46.800 --> 24:50.840
And I think, when you told
your father, there was an argument.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.160
I never meant to hurt him.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.120
But it must have
smacked of hypocrisy.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.520
I mean, there he was
marrying new girlfriend Ricki

24:58.520 --> 25:01.560
and he wouldn't let you
be with the man you loved.

25:01.560 --> 25:04.560
My father lived by his own rules.

25:04.560 --> 25:07.360
When I told him we were engaged,
he simply fired Manu

25:07.360 --> 25:10.040
and his whole family from
the plantation, just like that.

25:10.040 --> 25:12.560
He said he wanted
what was best for me.

25:13.560 --> 25:16.560
But if you think I killed him
for what he did, then you're wrong.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.480
He was all I ever really had.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.840
They think I did it.
They think I killed Dad!

25:36.440 --> 25:39.040
JP, Ruby,
any luck searching the estate?

25:39.040 --> 25:41.920
Sorry, sir.
Not a wig or a green robe in sight.

25:41.920 --> 25:44.160
But, the mobile phone network
has released

25:44.160 --> 25:46.000
all of the victim's phone records,

25:46.000 --> 25:48.920
which has given us access to
all of the unanswered voice messages

25:48.920 --> 25:51.600
and there was one. I'm all ears.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.680
VOICE MAIL: Hey, Benny.
It's Clinton.

25:53.680 --> 25:56.520
I looked into that thing
with the housekeeper, Miss Porter.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.280
She hasn't got a leg to stand on.

25:58.280 --> 26:02.200
I know she's going to be angry
but don't worry, we're covered.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.400
Ciao.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.880
I did a bit of digging,

26:04.880 --> 26:07.840
and I found out that Clinton
is Benedict's financial adviser.

26:07.840 --> 26:09.800
Now, he's in Miami
for business right now,

26:09.800 --> 26:12.680
but he'll be back tomorrow.
Top-notch work.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.440
And did you find out about the will?

26:14.440 --> 26:17.440
Mr Dacre's lawyer is arranging
for a copy to be sent over.

26:17.440 --> 26:20.800
Sir, I finally got a message
from Ricki's old employment agency.

26:20.800 --> 26:24.560
It turns out she was actually
working for the therapy clinic

26:24.560 --> 26:26.080
where she met Benedict.

26:26.080 --> 26:28.280
So she lied about being a patient?

26:28.280 --> 26:33.120
Yes, sir, and her old staff photos
are definitely worth seeing, sir.

26:33.120 --> 26:36.600
You all right there, JP? Seem to be
scratching yourself a fair bit.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.840
Er, yes, sir. I'm fine.

26:38.840 --> 26:41.560
Think I got bitten
at the plantation, or something.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.520
Er, yes, OK.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.640
Wow!

26:46.640 --> 26:48.120
That is a strong look.

26:49.320 --> 26:51.840
Looks like
she used to be called Ricki Logan.

26:51.840 --> 26:54.840
Well, Logan's actually
not her maiden name, sir.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.720
It's actually Ricki Lee Jones.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.560
She's been married twice before.

26:58.560 --> 27:01.160
So, what happened to
husbands number one and two?

27:01.160 --> 27:02.520
Both dead.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.600
Going somewhere nice?

27:09.600 --> 27:11.120
Hi, Inspector.

27:11.120 --> 27:15.000
Thought I'd hole up in a hotel
till Benny's funeral.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
I'm not exactly
Miss Popularity around here.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.160
It must be tough,
having to go to another funeral.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.000
This is number three, am I right?

27:22.000 --> 27:24.320
So what did
husband number one die of?

27:24.320 --> 27:25.480
Really?

27:26.720 --> 27:28.080
Heart attack.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.360
And number two?

27:29.360 --> 27:30.920
Heart attack.

27:30.920 --> 27:32.880
You're a genuine heartbreaker,
aren't you?

27:32.880 --> 27:34.720
So, how do you pick 'em?

27:34.720 --> 27:37.240
Take a look at their cardiogram
and their bank account?

27:37.240 --> 27:39.720
I know where you're going
with this, Inspector.

27:39.720 --> 27:42.400
But you're wrong.
I'm not a murderer.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.000
You're not
a real estate agent either.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.320
In fact, I have no idea who you
really are, Ricki Lee Jones.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.200
Have you ever nursed
someone who's sick?

27:53.200 --> 27:55.160
My wife, actually.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.760
Every day for two years.

27:57.800 --> 27:59.880
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.480
But then you'll know
that it's exhausting.

28:02.480 --> 28:06.200
And every day you're by their side,
you get closer to that person.

28:06.200 --> 28:09.040
You see a side of them
that no-one else sees,

28:09.040 --> 28:12.200
and you come to depend on
one another, emotionally and...

28:12.200 --> 28:13.440
Financially?

28:14.720 --> 28:17.560
Benedict proposed to me,
but you don't get it -

28:17.560 --> 28:19.040
it was about more than just money.

28:20.600 --> 28:24.720
I'm not stupid.
I know Benedict was not a nice man.

28:24.720 --> 28:26.560
But, he was nice to me.

28:26.560 --> 28:29.800
And his plantation
was worth 6 million.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.480
You've got it all figured out,
haven't you?

28:32.480 --> 28:36.640
Well, sorry to ruin your day,
but it's not that simple.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.320
I signed a pre-nup.

28:42.280 --> 28:44.880
Benny had been burned
by his last divorce.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.480
I'd get a lump sum of
a quarter of a million

28:47.480 --> 28:49.600
if we divorced, or if he died.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.520
I'm an outsider, Inspector.

28:53.520 --> 28:57.200
And outsiders can't ever
get their hands on the business.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.640
But Benedict sold the plantation.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.600
The buyer pulled out an hour ago.

29:01.600 --> 29:04.760
He didn't want to get snarled up
in years of legal wrangling.

29:04.760 --> 29:06.040
Wise man.

29:08.960 --> 29:13.880
So, we've got Benedict reading his
big old book out here by the pool,

29:13.880 --> 29:17.120
when someone masquerading as
Ciss Dacre, and making sure

29:17.120 --> 29:21.000
they're caught on CCTV,
comes along and shoots the poor guy.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.640
Four questions.

29:24.040 --> 29:26.040
Number one, who was it?

29:26.040 --> 29:28.200
Number two, how did they do it

29:28.200 --> 29:30.240
when all of our suspects
have alibis?

29:30.240 --> 29:35.160
Yeah. Owen, Ricki, Ruth, they were
all in the main house together.

29:35.160 --> 29:37.640
Josephine was with Ciss
in the bungalow,

29:37.640 --> 29:39.920
meaning none of them
were near the scene of the murder.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.400
Question number three.

29:42.400 --> 29:45.920
Why is the killer so keen to frame
Ciss Dacre for murder?

29:45.920 --> 29:49.480
Whoever it is clearly had
issues of some sort with the woman.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.520
So much so, they'd be
quite happy to see her

29:51.520 --> 29:53.880
spend the rest of her life
locked up in prison.

29:53.880 --> 29:55.920
Why? What did Ciss do to them?

29:57.760 --> 30:00.000
And the fourth question, Inspector?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
The fourth question.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.040
Why did our victim,
who we know was an avid reader,

30:06.040 --> 30:09.160
apparently not mark his place
in this book in any way whatsoever?

30:09.160 --> 30:12.480
No turned corners, no embossed
leatherette souvenir bookmark

30:12.480 --> 30:13.880
from the Tower of London.

30:15.920 --> 30:19.160
I don't know about you,
but my brain is scrambled.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.760
I vote we come at this
tomorrow with fresh eyes.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.720
Anyone fancy a beer?

30:27.720 --> 30:30.800
Sorry, sir, but I can't.
Patrice and me are heading up to...

30:30.800 --> 30:33.520
Oh, yeah.
The wedding venue. Of course.

30:33.520 --> 30:36.440
Well, hope it's as magical
as it sounds.

30:36.440 --> 30:39.240
Why don't you come,
if you don't have plans?

30:39.240 --> 30:43.200
Ah, no. No, wouldn't want to be
a gooseberry or a third wheel

30:43.200 --> 30:45.520
or whatever.
You won't be, I promise.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.920
And I'd really like you to see it.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.280
Hmm, well, I'd be honoured.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.040
Night, Ruby. Goodnight.

30:52.040 --> 30:54.240
Night, JP. Night, sir.

30:57.840 --> 31:01.080
JP? Why in the hell are you
so damned itchy all of a sudden?

31:01.080 --> 31:04.240
Look, I told you.
I can't keep secrets.

31:05.320 --> 31:07.520
And that makes you itchy?

31:07.520 --> 31:10.840
Yes, it does. Hot as well.
Hot and itchy.

31:10.840 --> 31:15.640
Well, if me making you cover up
for me is causing this,

31:15.640 --> 31:18.520
I'm going to tell Uncle Selly
about me getting arrested.

31:18.520 --> 31:20.880
You can't, Ruby. You might...

31:20.880 --> 31:22.760
Well, you might get suspended.

31:22.760 --> 31:23.960
Or worse.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.560
No, I won't.

31:25.560 --> 31:27.080
It's really not that big a deal.

31:27.080 --> 31:29.720
But it's the rules, Ruby.

31:29.720 --> 31:33.760
You can't be a police officer
with a criminal record.

31:35.960 --> 31:38.760
Look, either I tell Uncle Selly,

31:38.760 --> 31:41.960
or you keep it a secret
for the rest of your life.

31:44.240 --> 31:45.680
What's it going to be?

31:57.920 --> 32:01.080
Oh, my God! What happened?

32:02.400 --> 32:04.040
It's a mess.

32:04.040 --> 32:05.640
I'm so sorry.

32:05.640 --> 32:07.920
It's OK. I'm fine. It's just...

32:07.920 --> 32:10.680
I mean, we can't have
the wedding here.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.400
We'll have to find somewhere else.

32:12.400 --> 32:13.840
This was the place?

32:13.840 --> 32:15.320
Yes, it was.

32:15.320 --> 32:18.000
But sadly that place
doesn't exist any more.

32:20.840 --> 32:22.400
OK, let's go.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.640
Arrested?

32:33.640 --> 32:35.320
Well, it was only a caution.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.400
But it will be on record.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.120
You should have told me earlier.

32:41.320 --> 32:44.600
Well, I am sorry, but just tell me
what to do and I'll sort it out.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.320
You don't need to do anything.

32:46.320 --> 32:48.080
You can't do anything.

32:49.080 --> 32:52.920
I, on the other hand, have to inform
the Policing Standards Committee.

32:52.920 --> 32:56.680
The Policing Standards Committee?
Well, are they a real thing?

32:56.680 --> 32:58.480
Of course they're a real thing.

33:00.240 --> 33:03.840
Well, come on, Unc. I mean,
what's the worst that can happen?

33:06.600 --> 33:10.440
You could be dismissed
from the Saint Marie Police Force.

33:21.840 --> 33:24.200
MUSIC: Book of Rules by The Heptones

33:25.840 --> 33:29.680
# Isn't it strange

33:38.600 --> 33:40.440
Where the hell could it be?!

33:40.440 --> 33:41.880
Oh, my goodness!

33:43.440 --> 33:46.000
Miss Dacre. I am so sorry!

33:46.000 --> 33:47.520
I didn't mean to startle you.

33:47.520 --> 33:50.440
No, I'm sorry, it's OK. I just
didn't know there was anyone there.

33:50.440 --> 33:53.120
Yeah, just re-tracing a few steps.

33:53.120 --> 33:55.240
Not making much headway, mind you.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.920
You look tired,
if you don't mind me saying.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.120
No, I...

33:59.120 --> 34:00.800
I didn't get much sleep.

34:01.920 --> 34:02.960
Yeah.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.960
Don't normally smoke.

34:07.400 --> 34:12.199
You know, it only just
dawned on me last night

34:12.199 --> 34:14.960
that the person who killed Benedict,

34:14.960 --> 34:17.239
they want...

34:17.239 --> 34:19.239
they want me
to go to prison, don't they?

34:22.880 --> 34:24.639
I don't know who to trust any more.

34:26.080 --> 34:29.080
Somebody's playing a very unpleasant
game with you, Miss Dacre.

34:29.080 --> 34:30.600
You're bound to feel paranoid.

34:31.920 --> 34:34.239
I can't do anything to stop that,

34:34.239 --> 34:37.000
but I promise you,
I will find out who it is.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.159
Sir?

34:39.560 --> 34:42.199
Ah, I'll... I'll leave you
to your work.

34:42.199 --> 34:43.800
Thank you.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.960
The guys told me you'd be here.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.639
Yeah, I was hoping
coming back to the scene

34:49.639 --> 34:51.960
might get the old
hamster wheel turning again.

34:51.960 --> 34:54.760
And I thought I'd have another
look at these flower beds.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.159
What were you looking for?

34:56.159 --> 34:58.200
Oh, an old receipt.
A bus ticket.

34:58.200 --> 35:01.360
Anything that Benedict
could've used as a bookmark.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.000
I mean, here we have
a man of ritual.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.840
Always takes time to sit here,
with his posh brandy and a cigar,

35:07.840 --> 35:09.920
reading for an hour.

35:09.920 --> 35:13.080
And yet he doesn't bother to mark
where he is in a 600-page book.

35:13.080 --> 35:14.760
Just doesn't sit right.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.960
Does that water look funny to you?

35:21.960 --> 35:25.080
Sort of a green-ish hue to it, no?

35:25.080 --> 35:27.000
I guess so, sir.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.360
I'd say the old doohickey
must be on the blink.

35:29.360 --> 35:30.840
Doohickey?

35:30.840 --> 35:33.520
Yeah, doohickey,
you know, the thingamajiggy.

35:48.160 --> 35:49.240
Oh, hello!

36:04.080 --> 36:06.200
The Policing Standards Committee?!

36:06.200 --> 36:09.360
I guess I might be looking
for job number 14 very soon.

36:10.480 --> 36:13.040
And I was just starting
to like this job.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.320
I thought I could be,
I don't know...

36:15.320 --> 36:17.040
..good at it?

36:18.560 --> 36:20.760
Look, I... I'm really sorry, Ruby.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.640
So we found our wig, and our robe.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.720
So we missed it?

36:25.720 --> 36:28.120
Ah, there's no shame in that, JP.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.400
It was stuffed into
the pool pump basket.

36:30.400 --> 36:32.840
Chlorine's probably
wiped away any DNA,

36:32.840 --> 36:34.880
but let's get them
checked out anyway.

36:34.880 --> 36:36.400
Yes, sir. Thank you.

36:36.400 --> 36:40.320
Oh, and sir, Clinton Ross,
Benedict's money man, got in touch.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.440
Apparently, Benedict Dacre
was refusing to pay

36:42.440 --> 36:44.920
Josephine Porter her pension. Nasty!

36:44.920 --> 36:47.800
How long has Josephine
worked at Paradise Skies?

36:47.800 --> 36:49.480
It's coming up to 35 years, now.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.160
That'd be a sizeable sum.

36:51.160 --> 36:54.240
But if she kills Benedict,
problem simply goes away?

36:54.240 --> 36:57.120
But if she loves Ciss Dacre,
why would she try to frame her?

36:57.120 --> 37:00.200
Unless Josephine
isn't in love with Ciss.

37:00.200 --> 37:02.200
JP, any joy with the will?

37:02.200 --> 37:04.440
Oh, they're faxing it
over in an hour, sir.

37:04.440 --> 37:07.000
Great. Quicker we find out
who gets what,

37:07.000 --> 37:08.920
the sooner we might get
to solving this.

37:08.920 --> 37:10.640
Ruby, you used to be a hairdresser?

37:10.640 --> 37:13.440
Oh, yes, sir.
What do you make of that wig?

37:17.440 --> 37:19.320
Oh, this is real hair, sir.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.360
Not that cheap horse hair business.

37:21.360 --> 37:23.600
And it's pretty pricey, too.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.760
There's only three shops
on the island that would sell
a wig of this quality.

37:26.760 --> 37:29.680
OK, why don't you pay them a visit?
I'm on it, sir.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.320
As for you and me, Florence,

37:31.320 --> 37:34.520
I think it's time we had a little
chat with the housekeeper.

37:36.960 --> 37:40.640
35 years working for
the Dacre family. That's loyalty.

37:40.640 --> 37:44.240
I've always taken pride
in my work, Inspector.

37:44.240 --> 37:47.080
I like to think of myself
as more than just a housekeeper.

37:47.080 --> 37:48.720
Did Benedict?

37:49.920 --> 37:51.880
I don't know.

37:51.880 --> 37:53.120
35 years.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.720
Barely a promotion.

37:54.720 --> 37:55.920
No pension.

37:55.920 --> 37:58.600
He thought of you as
"the help", nothing more.

37:59.680 --> 38:02.640
Benedict was a complex man.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.120
Really?

38:04.120 --> 38:06.040
Because he made a simple decision.

38:06.040 --> 38:09.760
He wasn't going to pay you a penny
for all those years of service.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.640
You'd be jobless and penniless.

38:11.640 --> 38:14.200
I doubt if Benedict would even
give you a reference.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.600
You were desperate
to get that pension.

38:16.600 --> 38:18.240
Of course I wanted that money.

38:18.240 --> 38:20.920
I earned it! Every penny!

38:20.920 --> 38:23.160
But would I kill to get it?

38:23.160 --> 38:25.240
Are you mad?

38:25.240 --> 38:27.680
This was about more than
money, wasn't it?

38:27.680 --> 38:29.720
This is about respect as well.

38:29.720 --> 38:33.000
All that time, you were still
treated like the hired help.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
Now, that must have hurt Ciss
as much as it hurt you.

38:38.400 --> 38:43.160
I was here with Ciss
when that shot was fired, Inspector.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.320
And that is all
I have to say on the matter.

38:56.200 --> 38:59.160
Do you think she's really
capable of murder, sir?

38:59.160 --> 39:02.520
Well, I think she might have been
deeply hurt by Benedict's betrayal.

39:02.520 --> 39:05.120
But would she dress up as Ciss
and kill her boss?

39:05.120 --> 39:07.360
PHONE RINGS
Might be a bit of a stretch.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.400
JP, what have you got for me?

39:09.400 --> 39:11.720
This is a very weird will, sir.

39:11.720 --> 39:14.480
How weird?
It doesn't involve animals, does it?

39:14.480 --> 39:16.760
Er, no. No animals, sir.

39:16.760 --> 39:19.800
But it does stipulate that
the Paradise Skies Estate

39:19.800 --> 39:22.600
can only be passed onto
the closest male heir.

39:22.600 --> 39:25.200
And legally,
the clause cannot be altered.

39:25.200 --> 39:29.000
And the next immediate
male heir is Owen Dacre.

39:30.640 --> 39:32.440
Quick word, Owen, if you don't mind.

39:32.440 --> 39:34.120
I'm going to work, Inspector.

39:34.120 --> 39:35.360
Won't take a minute.

39:35.360 --> 39:39.960
Did you know you're the heir
to the Paradise Skies Fortune?

39:41.240 --> 39:43.880
That's news to me, Inspector.
I thought Ruth would get it all.

39:43.880 --> 39:47.520
No. The truth is, only a male heir
can inherit the estate.

39:47.520 --> 39:49.960
So sexism is
another Dacre family tradition?

39:49.960 --> 39:51.240
I hate this place.

39:51.240 --> 39:52.400
It's a relic.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.240
My uncle was too stupid
to think about the future.

39:55.240 --> 39:57.680
Very expensive relic.
Now it belongs to you.

39:59.480 --> 40:00.880
This house is a prison.

40:00.880 --> 40:03.520
And they're all trapped inside.
Every single one of them.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.400
Some people find it hard
to let go of the past.

40:05.400 --> 40:06.880
Yeah, well, I'm not one of them.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.440
Let me.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.160
"Building a brighter future
for Paradise Skies Coffee."

40:16.160 --> 40:18.000
I thought you hated the place?

40:20.400 --> 40:24.400
Just cos I hate the place
doesn't mean I'm bad at my job.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.800
I just can't get my head around it.

40:34.800 --> 40:38.120
Owen is the only one who can legally
get his hands on the estate.

40:38.120 --> 40:41.920
But I'm not sure if he's a wannabe
tycoon, or just an angry young man.

40:41.920 --> 40:44.480
And he's got an alibi.
They've all got bloomin' alibis.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.280
Owen. Ricki. Ruth.

40:46.280 --> 40:48.240
They're all here in the lounge
in the main house.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.840
Josephine is with Ciss,
relaxing up here at the bungalow.

40:50.840 --> 40:54.160
Which means none of them were near
the pool when that shot was fired!

40:55.480 --> 40:58.720
And then, then we've got a lady,
or, or possibly a fella,

40:58.720 --> 41:01.240
wandering around in a robe
with a gun in their hand,

41:01.240 --> 41:03.880
making us think that
Ciss Dacre is the murderer.

41:03.880 --> 41:06.720
Sir, the test came back
on Ciss Dacre's robe,

41:06.720 --> 41:08.280
the one we found in her bedroom.

41:08.280 --> 41:11.200
There is no blood spatter
or gunshot residue.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.440
Confirms Ciss didn't fire the gun.

41:13.440 --> 41:16.760
The robe we found in the pump basket
must be the one the killer wore.

41:16.760 --> 41:20.760
The only thing we can be certain of
is that this person on CCTV

41:20.760 --> 41:22.440
is our killer.

41:22.440 --> 41:24.440
Ruby, some good news, please?

41:24.440 --> 41:26.240
I spoke to Letitia at HairWaves.

41:26.240 --> 41:28.520
By the way, they have the most
amazing wigs down there.

41:28.520 --> 41:31.720
Anyway, she told me that a customer
came in about a week ago,

41:31.720 --> 41:34.680
wore big sunglasses
and bought a short brown wig,

41:34.680 --> 41:36.280
and had an American accent.

41:36.280 --> 41:37.680
Ricki.

41:37.680 --> 41:39.760
I have her credit card receipt here.

41:39.760 --> 41:42.440
The wig was purchased
with Ricki Dacre's card.

41:42.440 --> 41:45.000
Excellent work, Ruby.
And that's not all!

41:45.000 --> 41:51.000
I have the enhanced CCTV images from
my friends down at the photo lab.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.360
Check this out.

41:52.360 --> 41:53.480
Disco Rouge.

41:53.480 --> 41:55.280
Disco what? Oh!

41:55.280 --> 41:57.240
I was a nail technician
for six months,

41:57.240 --> 41:59.360
and I knew every
colour off by heart.

41:59.360 --> 42:01.880
That nail colour there,
that is Disco Rouge.

42:01.880 --> 42:05.480
And there's only one person
I've seen wearing that recently.

42:07.440 --> 42:10.000
Something bothering you there,
Mrs Dacre?

42:11.120 --> 42:12.680
Three strikes and you're out!

42:16.600 --> 42:18.760
You want to arrest me
because of my nails?

42:18.760 --> 42:20.080
Fierce colour.

42:20.080 --> 42:22.960
We've got footage of you
wearing her robe and a wig.

42:22.960 --> 42:26.280
The gun is in your hand,
and you're wearing those nails.

42:27.440 --> 42:29.240
A wig? This is nuts!

42:29.240 --> 42:31.200
Your plastic says otherwise.

42:31.200 --> 42:34.280
That's your name on the receipt,
Mrs Dacre.

42:34.280 --> 42:38.000
Wait, what?!
No, I never bought a wig.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.960
Someone must've stolen my card.

42:39.960 --> 42:43.080
Look, I told you, we were
getting blasted in the lounge.

42:43.080 --> 42:44.480
All of us.

42:44.480 --> 42:47.000
And it was your idea, right?
The drinks.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.880
You wanted to loosen them up a bit.

42:48.880 --> 42:51.240
It's funny what a few drinks
will do to the memory.

42:51.240 --> 42:52.880
Creates the odd black spot, I find.

42:52.880 --> 42:55.360
That gave you the perfect
opportunity to sneak out

42:55.360 --> 42:56.680
and kill Benedict.

42:56.680 --> 42:59.080
No, no, no!
You've got this all backwards.

42:59.080 --> 43:00.680
Inspector, look at me.

43:00.680 --> 43:03.800
I did not kill my husband.

43:06.040 --> 43:07.400
Come on.

43:07.400 --> 43:08.680
Let's go.

43:08.680 --> 43:10.240
Look, you've got it wrong!

43:12.360 --> 43:15.400
You know, maybe now that
we've cracked the case,

43:15.400 --> 43:17.760
I won't have that stupid
jingle in my head all the time.

43:17.760 --> 43:19.520
Small mercies, eh, Ruby?

43:21.400 --> 43:23.880
# Whoa, whoa, wake up
to Paradise Skies

43:23.880 --> 43:25.440
# It's a bright new day

43:25.440 --> 43:26.760
# Tis the sunshine glory

43:26.760 --> 43:28.720
# Time to write a different story

43:29.960 --> 43:32.840
♪ Time to write
a different story... ♪

43:32.840 --> 43:35.160
Florence, wait!

43:37.160 --> 43:40.760
That's it!
It's an entirely different story!

43:40.760 --> 43:42.120
Where are you going?

43:42.120 --> 43:43.240
The study!

43:44.680 --> 43:46.360
No bookmark, sir.

43:51.280 --> 43:53.160
No bookmark, sir.

43:57.480 --> 43:58.560
Sir!

44:00.040 --> 44:01.600
How did you know?

44:01.600 --> 44:02.720
I didn't.

44:14.280 --> 44:17.880
Which means none of them were near
the pool when that shot was fired.

44:17.880 --> 44:20.160
Where were you
when you heard the gunshot?

44:20.160 --> 44:22.680
In the lounge, getting
wasted with everyone else.

44:23.920 --> 44:25.520
Do you have it?

44:26.680 --> 44:29.640
I made her some cocoa
whilst she had a shower.

44:29.640 --> 44:32.840
You're the heir to
the Paradise Skies fortune.

44:32.840 --> 44:35.760
That's news to me, Inspector.
I thought Ruth would get it all.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.160
Does that water look funny to you?

44:38.600 --> 44:39.840
That's outrageous!

44:39.840 --> 44:41.440
The barefaced cheek of it!

44:41.440 --> 44:44.000
Florence, Ruby,
round up the suspects.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.160
JP, one last job.

44:45.160 --> 44:47.160
I need you to dig up a flower bed.

44:52.160 --> 44:53.760
OWEN: Why are we here, Inspector?

44:53.760 --> 44:56.080
We're here to solve
your uncle's murder.

44:56.080 --> 44:58.080
Ah, well, I'm surprised
it took you so long.

44:58.080 --> 45:01.040
Well, I admit, it was a tough one,

45:01.040 --> 45:04.920
although on the surface, it looked
like it might be quite simple.

45:04.920 --> 45:07.640
New young wife,
on her third wealthy husband.

45:07.640 --> 45:09.560
All the hallmarks of a gold digger.

45:09.560 --> 45:11.640
No offence. None taken.

45:11.640 --> 45:15.440
And, if it was her, how better to
deflect attention from herself

45:15.440 --> 45:17.760
than to disguise herself
as somebody else?

45:17.760 --> 45:21.280
The victim's sister. Make sure
she was seen on the security camera,

45:21.280 --> 45:23.960
dressed as Ciss Dacre
and holding the murder weapon.

45:25.120 --> 45:28.480
But then, how could Ricki
be in two places at once?

45:28.480 --> 45:33.040
She was in the house with you the
whole time when the shot was fired.

45:33.040 --> 45:34.640
And the truth is,

45:34.640 --> 45:36.840
none of you were lying
about where you were

45:36.840 --> 45:38.360
when that shot was fired.

45:38.360 --> 45:42.120
But the problem is, that wasn't
the shot that killed Benedict.

45:42.120 --> 45:44.720
What you all heard
was the second shot.

45:44.720 --> 45:46.360
No, wait! There was only one shot.

45:46.360 --> 45:48.120
I heard it. We all heard it.

45:48.120 --> 45:50.280
Well, that was the idea
all right, yeah.

45:53.320 --> 45:54.880
Recognise this?

45:54.880 --> 45:56.760
It's a bookmark.

45:56.760 --> 45:58.120
Fancy one, too.

45:58.120 --> 46:00.920
A bookmark that tells me a story.

46:03.360 --> 46:06.160
A story written by you...

46:10.800 --> 46:12.120
..wasn't it, Ciss?

46:13.320 --> 46:16.480
I, I, I don't know what
you're talking about.

46:16.480 --> 46:18.280
No, but what you did know

46:18.280 --> 46:20.840
was that your brother Benedict
was a man of ritual.

46:20.840 --> 46:23.120
Certain things
he did like clockwork,

46:23.120 --> 46:26.240
like having a brandy and reading
a book by the pool at night.

46:26.240 --> 46:28.040
And that's where you'd kill him.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.440
After dinner, you made your excuses.

46:31.440 --> 46:35.720
You went up to the bedroom to
add the details - nails and a robe.

46:35.720 --> 46:37.920
Then you took the gun
from the study,

46:37.920 --> 46:39.360
and a book.

46:39.360 --> 46:42.600
One of those
"big, dull history books".

46:42.600 --> 46:45.720
Something that would be sure
to silence the shot.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.200
Pow!

46:52.160 --> 46:55.600
You'd argued earlier. You went
down to the swimming pool

46:55.600 --> 46:59.680
under the pretence of
apologising to him, didn't you?

46:59.680 --> 47:02.560
And I'm guessing
he turned his back on you,

47:02.560 --> 47:05.120
to make the apology even harder

47:05.120 --> 47:07.720
because that's
the sort of man he was.

47:07.720 --> 47:10.760
And that big, dull history book
really did its job.

47:10.760 --> 47:13.120
Nobody heard the first shot.

47:13.120 --> 47:14.880
The shot that killed Benedict.

47:17.240 --> 47:19.560
With Benedict dead,
you had to act fast.

47:19.560 --> 47:22.320
Because you still had a few
little tricks left to play.

47:22.320 --> 47:25.480
You see, the idea -
it wasn't just murder, was it?

47:25.480 --> 47:27.360
What if you could make it look like

47:27.360 --> 47:29.920
your brother
was killed by his new young wife?

47:31.000 --> 47:33.480
I have to say, what you did next...

47:33.480 --> 47:34.960
really quite brilliant.

47:36.160 --> 47:38.600
It's why it took me
so long to unpick everything.

47:38.600 --> 47:41.360
You disguised yourself as yourself!

47:41.360 --> 47:42.760
Ingenious.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.520
That's why you hid
the bloody robe and the wig

47:46.520 --> 47:48.400
in the swimming pool pump basket.

47:48.400 --> 47:52.240
And you put the book you'd used
as a silencer back in the study.

47:52.240 --> 47:55.560
Who'd look for it?
And you left a book by his body.

47:56.600 --> 48:01.480
And then you strolled past the CCTV,
with a gun in your hand,

48:01.480 --> 48:04.200
as though you were completely
unaware of the camera.

48:04.200 --> 48:07.240
Oh, you left us a few clues
all right, thank you for that.

48:07.240 --> 48:09.640
The re-painted nails and a wig

48:09.640 --> 48:11.880
you bought using her credit card.

48:11.880 --> 48:15.520
It was vital that everyone saw you
walking towards the pool

48:15.520 --> 48:19.160
just a few minutes
before the shot was fired.

48:19.160 --> 48:20.800
This is complete nonsense.

48:20.800 --> 48:22.640
No, it's brilliant.

48:22.640 --> 48:26.080
You see, you weren't going to murder
Benedict at that stage.

48:26.080 --> 48:28.680
He was already
lying face down in the pool.

48:28.680 --> 48:31.680
You were going to see Josephine,
the woman you love...

48:32.800 --> 48:34.520
..and your airtight alibi.

48:34.520 --> 48:37.760
And that's where you staged
the end of the first chapter.

48:39.520 --> 48:43.200
This was only the beginning of the
story that you wanted us to follow.

48:43.200 --> 48:47.320
Owen, Ricki, Ruth, they were
all in the house the whole time.

48:47.320 --> 48:49.120
Whereas your alibi, Josephine -

48:49.120 --> 48:52.480
she told us you went to the bathroom
while she was making the cocoa.

48:52.480 --> 48:56.400
And that's where and when
you fired the shot

48:56.400 --> 48:58.640
that everyone believed
killed Benedict.

48:58.640 --> 49:00.440
GUNSHOT

49:00.440 --> 49:01.680
JP?

49:01.680 --> 49:05.120
The bullet we found in the soil
outside the bathroom window

49:05.120 --> 49:06.800
of Josephine Porter's bungalow.

49:06.800 --> 49:09.000
Now, all you had to do...

49:10.560 --> 49:14.560
..was dump the gun and
just wait for us to do our jobs.

49:15.680 --> 49:17.800
Why would I frame myself, Inspector?

49:17.800 --> 49:19.360
One word. Doubt.

49:19.360 --> 49:21.880
You did just enough
to make us think it was you.

49:21.880 --> 49:24.440
But then your alibi threw us,
as you knew it would.

49:24.440 --> 49:26.720
And suddenly we started
to doubt ourselves.

49:26.720 --> 49:29.920
And doubt - well,
that's a copper's worst enemy.

49:29.920 --> 49:34.000
As we started to dig deeper,
we followed your story to a T.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.160
You knew the dye from the robe
would stain the pool water.

49:37.160 --> 49:39.920
And the chlorine
would wipe away any DNA.

49:39.920 --> 49:44.080
But, most importantly of all,
you knew we'd stumble across them,

49:44.080 --> 49:45.960
the wig and the robe.

49:45.960 --> 49:48.160
In fact, you counted on it,
didn't you?

49:48.160 --> 49:50.160
And you knew we'd track down the wig

49:50.160 --> 49:52.680
and believe it was
Ricki who bought it.

49:52.680 --> 49:56.480
Every little detail - the book,
the wig, the nails, the CCTV -

49:56.480 --> 50:00.800
it was all done to make us doubt our
investigation every step of the way.

50:00.800 --> 50:03.280
And I have to hand it to you,
it nearly worked.

50:03.280 --> 50:06.320
We went from believing it was you
to being nearly 100% sure

50:06.320 --> 50:08.160
it was Ricki trying to frame you.

50:09.800 --> 50:12.440
But, when you went
to apologise to Benedict,

50:12.440 --> 50:13.960
you made two simple mistakes.

50:13.960 --> 50:16.760
You picked up the book
that Benedict was reading

50:16.760 --> 50:20.440
to silence the shot, not
the one you took down with you.

50:22.240 --> 50:25.080
And then you forgot
to put Benedict's bookmark

50:25.080 --> 50:26.960
in the book that you left behind.

50:26.960 --> 50:28.760
You spun us a fantastic story.

50:28.760 --> 50:30.560
But you botched the ending.

50:31.600 --> 50:34.280
I had nothing to gain
from my brother's death.

50:34.280 --> 50:35.600
Absolutely nothing.

50:35.600 --> 50:36.760
You don't.

50:36.760 --> 50:38.440
But Owen does.

50:38.440 --> 50:41.040
The plantation can only be passed
to the next male

50:41.040 --> 50:42.880
on the family bloodline.

50:42.880 --> 50:46.960
This house had you trapped,
hadn't it, Ciss?

50:46.960 --> 50:51.000
But you were always loyal
to the Dacre name.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.320
And you knew that Paradise Skies
Coffee could be managed far better

50:54.320 --> 50:56.360
than the way your brother
was running it.

50:56.360 --> 50:59.400
"Building a brighter future
for Paradise Skies Coffee."

50:59.400 --> 51:02.160
You knew that someday
this place would be Owen's.

51:02.160 --> 51:04.640
He'd look after the business
in the right way.

51:04.640 --> 51:05.960
You even prepared him for it

51:05.960 --> 51:08.600
by sending him out into
the coffee fields every summer.

51:08.600 --> 51:10.200
Tell me you didn't do this, please.

51:10.200 --> 51:11.800
You knew, once Owen took over,

51:11.800 --> 51:14.800
that you and Josephine
could finally be together.

51:14.800 --> 51:17.120
But then Benedict decided to sell.

51:19.320 --> 51:20.880
So you killed him,

51:20.880 --> 51:22.960
so that you, and your son,
and Josephine

51:22.960 --> 51:25.640
could finally face the future.

51:25.640 --> 51:30.160
But sadly, that's a future
you'll never get to see.

51:31.600 --> 51:33.360
It doesn't matter, Inspector.

51:33.360 --> 51:35.000
Don't you get it?

51:35.000 --> 51:36.800
I won.

51:36.800 --> 51:39.280
Squeak won.

51:39.280 --> 51:40.760
You call this winning?

51:40.760 --> 51:43.960
Paradise Skies is my son's now.

51:43.960 --> 51:45.960
My brother didn't deserve it.
He never did.

51:45.960 --> 51:49.040
And you can be damn sure
I wasn't going to let him sell it.

51:49.040 --> 51:50.720
I'd call that winning.

51:52.120 --> 51:54.280
Mum! What have you done?

51:54.280 --> 51:57.520
Paradise Skies is yours now,
darling, it's all yours.

51:58.800 --> 52:01.640
Wait! Wait!

52:05.080 --> 52:06.840
Look after this place.

52:06.840 --> 52:08.440
All right. And each other.

52:08.440 --> 52:10.280
Come on!

52:16.000 --> 52:17.440
You know what, Florence?

52:17.440 --> 52:19.240
I'm gasping for a cup of tea.

52:35.680 --> 52:36.920
KNOCK ON DOOR

52:36.920 --> 52:38.080
Yes, enter!

52:40.520 --> 52:42.120
Commissioner.

52:47.320 --> 52:51.000
Let me guess. You're here
to talk about Officer Patterson.

52:53.520 --> 52:54.720
Yes, sir.

52:57.840 --> 53:01.160
I'd really like to be there when
you talk to the Standards Committee.

53:01.160 --> 53:05.480
I believe that Ruby
is an exceptional police officer

53:05.480 --> 53:07.960
and I'm proud
to call her my partner.

53:07.960 --> 53:09.240
And...

53:10.920 --> 53:13.120
I don't think
she deserves to be sacked.

53:14.560 --> 53:17.240
I'll bear that in mind
when I make my decision.

53:20.200 --> 53:21.600
Your decision?

53:24.440 --> 53:26.600
I am the Standards Committee.

53:26.600 --> 53:29.880
And that was quite a stirring
defence of your colleague.

53:33.960 --> 53:35.720
Why didn't you tell Ruby that?

53:36.720 --> 53:40.160
Because I want my niece to realise
how much this job means to her.

53:40.160 --> 53:43.000
Sometimes you don't realise
how much you have,

53:43.000 --> 53:45.400
until there's a danger
of you losing it.

53:49.280 --> 53:51.640
You know, on my wedding day
I was so nervous

53:51.640 --> 53:53.760
I had to change my shirt twice.

53:53.760 --> 53:56.240
I was sweating buckets, so I was.

53:56.240 --> 53:59.360
But then, as I saw my wife
walking down the aisle,

53:59.360 --> 54:00.920
it all made sense.

54:00.920 --> 54:03.200
She was so beautiful, so calm.

54:04.280 --> 54:06.480
When I see you
and Florence together,

54:06.480 --> 54:08.480
I have to say it all
makes perfect sense too.

54:08.480 --> 54:10.520
Thank you. That means a lot.

54:15.520 --> 54:17.080
What have you been up to, Jack?

54:17.080 --> 54:18.600
Ah, call it my wedding present.

54:18.600 --> 54:20.120
No, it's too much.

54:20.120 --> 54:22.480
No, no, no, no,
just a few favours, is all.

54:22.480 --> 54:24.960
Mostly superficial,
lick of paint here and there.

54:24.960 --> 54:27.240
You'd be surprised
at how many people

54:27.240 --> 54:29.400
want to do the local
police inspector a favour!

54:29.400 --> 54:30.680
Hello, Inspector!

54:32.360 --> 54:36.160
I just hope your wedding day
is as wonderful as mine was.

54:36.160 --> 54:39.720
Florence deserves it. She's
a very, very special young woman.

54:39.720 --> 54:42.280
Yes. She is.

54:44.040 --> 54:47.840
We're all heading back to my place
later, if you fancy a quick one?

54:47.840 --> 54:50.400
Just a quiet one, you know?

54:50.400 --> 54:55.520
CHEERING AND SHOUTING

55:06.440 --> 55:09.600
Yes! I told you he's invincible.

55:11.600 --> 55:12.840
So!

55:13.880 --> 55:15.880
This is where all the action is.

55:15.880 --> 55:18.840
Well, it's not
strictly illegal, sir.

55:18.840 --> 55:20.800
This is my property.

55:20.800 --> 55:23.200
And these are all my friends.

55:23.200 --> 55:26.080
I see you've come up
with a smart way

55:26.080 --> 55:28.800
to exploit a loophole
in our law, Inspector.

55:31.400 --> 55:32.800
Now...

55:34.480 --> 55:35.920
..who's the favourite?

55:35.920 --> 55:39.040
It's been a long time
since I've been crab racing.

55:39.040 --> 55:41.680
I'd put my cash on Colin, sir.

55:41.680 --> 55:44.560
Trust me, that crab
is an eight-legged Shergar!

55:46.680 --> 55:49.800
You could probably do with a beer.
Er, yup.

55:51.160 --> 55:54.720
Sir, Patrice just told me
what you've done.

55:54.720 --> 55:57.840
Oh, don't be getting all soppy
on me. This is a clean shirt.

55:57.840 --> 55:59.440
Thank you.

56:00.680 --> 56:02.320
Any word from the committee?

56:02.320 --> 56:05.040
No need for the committee
to look at your case.

56:05.040 --> 56:06.280
There isn't?

56:06.280 --> 56:07.520
No.

56:07.520 --> 56:08.960
The funny thing is,

56:08.960 --> 56:11.840
there's no record of your arrest
anywhere to be found.

56:11.840 --> 56:13.440
Well, that is funny.

56:13.440 --> 56:16.200
No doubt
an administrative oversight.

56:17.520 --> 56:20.640
Well, I do love
an administrative oversight.

56:20.640 --> 56:25.240
So, no further action will be taken.

56:25.240 --> 56:26.480
Thank you.

56:47.800 --> 56:50.160
CHEERING

56:50.160 --> 56:51.800
Come on, Colin!

56:59.600 --> 57:01.080
Good to see you, man!

57:01.080 --> 57:03.800
Yeah, my first Mahi Mahi Festival.
I wouldn't miss it for the world!

57:03.800 --> 57:05.200
She's coming!

57:05.200 --> 57:06.440
Tiana!

57:06.440 --> 57:07.960
Hey.

57:07.960 --> 57:09.640
Something's wrong.

57:12.600 --> 57:16.200
HEARTBEAT POUNDS SLOWLY

57:23.520 --> 57:24.960
GUNSHOT

57:25.305 --> 57:31.807
