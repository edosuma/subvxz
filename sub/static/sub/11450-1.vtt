02:40.293 --> 02:42.688
Hold on, I can't hear you.

02:42.763 --> 02:46.425
Okay, that's better. Where are you guys?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.761
No, I don't... I don't know where that is.

02:48.836 --> 02:52.564
I don't... I don't have GPS on this phone.

02:52.639 --> 02:55.640
Well, can you just give me
directions from here?

02:56.342 --> 02:58.177
Hello?

02:59.879 --> 03:01.741
Shit.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.710
Come on.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.996
You okay?

03:07.071 --> 03:09.114
Yeah. I'm just...

03:09.189 --> 03:12.563
- Couldn't help but...
- Yeah. No, no, I'm fine. I just...

03:12.638 --> 03:15.854
I lost my friends.
And I have no reception. So...

03:15.929 --> 03:17.656
Where are you headed?

03:20.157 --> 03:22.461
- Lan Kwai...
- Lan Kwai Fong.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.096
- Yeah.
- You need directions?

03:24.171 --> 03:26.565
Yeah, that'd be great.
I don't have GPS on my phone.

03:26.640 --> 03:30.503
Yeah, I heard. So, it's easy.
You just walk down these stairs here, okay?

03:30.578 --> 03:32.471
- Take a right on Elgin.
- Okay.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.606
- And you go till you hit the escalators.
- Escalators.

03:34.681 --> 03:38.711
- Yeah, mid-level escalators.
- Okay, what building?

03:39.486 --> 03:43.749
- No, they're outside.
- Oh, like in the middle of the street?

03:43.824 --> 03:48.504
Yeah. It's one of Hong Kong's most
famous sights. The mid-level escalators.

03:48.579 --> 03:49.906
It's in all the guidebooks.

03:50.031 --> 03:51.690
- The mid-level escalators.
- Yeah, okay.

03:51.765 --> 03:55.160
Okay? So you go up two blocks,
you take a right on Hollywood.

03:55.235 --> 03:59.149
You know, I think I'm just... I'll just ask
someone when I get off the escalators.

03:59.606 --> 04:01.433
- Are you sure?
- Thanks. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.602
I mean, I...

04:03.677 --> 04:06.176
I can... I can walk you there.

04:07.476 --> 04:09.207
No.

04:09.282 --> 04:10.642
- Thanks, though.
- Yeah.

04:10.717 --> 04:14.497
- Yeah.
- Okay. Just down to the right.

04:38.678 --> 04:40.839
- You lost already?
- Yeah, you know, it's...

04:40.914 --> 04:44.494
It's just pretty confusing down there.

04:44.717 --> 04:47.698
Well, my offer still stands.

04:54.093 --> 04:56.313
Are you sure I'm not taking you
away from anything? I don't...

04:56.388 --> 04:58.924
It's fine. It's a big birthday party,

04:58.999 --> 05:04.514
I doubt anyone will miss me for 5 minutes.
So let me just text somebody.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.868
Okay. Good to go.

05:09.943 --> 05:14.691
- I really appreciate it, thank you so much.
- Don't mention it. Don't mention it.

05:26.559 --> 05:30.623
- I'm Ruby, by the way.
- Nice to meet you, Ruby by the way.

05:30.698 --> 05:33.325
- I'm Josh.
- Hey.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.995
- First time in Hong Kong?
- Yes, it is. I'm guessing it's not yours.

05:37.070 --> 05:40.132
No, I live here. Where you from?

05:40.207 --> 05:42.034
- California.
- Cool.

05:42.109 --> 05:45.069
- San Francisco?
- Nope, L.A.

05:45.946 --> 05:49.541
- And where are you from?
- New York.

05:49.616 --> 05:52.010
- What?
- Nothing, it's just so cliche

05:52.085 --> 05:54.931
for New Yorkers to hate on L.A.

05:55.556 --> 05:59.017
- So have you ever been?
- No, I never saw the need.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.353
What? You got something
against nice weather?

06:01.428 --> 06:04.256
See there's something very wrong
with your city when the only good thing

06:04.331 --> 06:08.126
- you have going for it is the weather.
- Okay, that's not the only nice thing.

06:08.201 --> 06:12.750
Yeah, I guess. If you like earthquakes.

06:15.141 --> 06:17.970
- So this is Soho.
- Just like New York.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.005
- And London.
- Buenos Aires.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.574
Apparently you're not a major city
unless you have a Soho.

06:22.649 --> 06:26.178
- What does this Soho stand for?
- South of Hollywood.

06:26.253 --> 06:30.299
I wonder why L.A. hasn't jumped
on that bandwagon... don't even start.

06:32.459 --> 06:35.390
- So what brings you to Hong Kong?
- Work.

06:35.465 --> 06:37.697
- What do you do?
- I design toys.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.992
Well, that's cool. What kind?

06:40.067 --> 06:43.529
Have you ever seen those
stuffed animals that sing and dance?

06:43.604 --> 06:46.232
My niece is obsessed with this one toy.
It's a... it's a beaver, but it's...

06:46.307 --> 06:47.900
- Justin Beaver.
- Justin...

06:47.975 --> 06:49.468
- Yeah.
- Oh, my... you?

06:49.543 --> 06:52.403
- I designed that. Yep.
- What? Really?

06:52.478 --> 06:56.174
That's pretty cool. She's obsessed
with one toy and you designed it.

06:56.249 --> 06:59.511
- Apparently.
- What else you got?

07:00.046 --> 07:04.182
Let's see, I have...
Moos Like Jagger. It's a cow.

07:04.257 --> 07:08.447
- Lady Ba-ba. A sheep.
- A sheep? Where can I get one of these?

07:08.522 --> 07:10.589
I don't know. If I see you
next time I'll give you one.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.724
Are you planning on getting lost
around here in the near future?

07:12.799 --> 07:14.192
Well, now I know who to call.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.194
You don't even know
if I'm taking you to the right place.

07:16.269 --> 07:21.300
Yeah. My mother did warn me
about talking to random strangers,

07:21.375 --> 07:25.304
- in a foreign city.
- Such oddly specific advice.

07:25.379 --> 07:28.358
She's like that.
She's like a fortune cookie.

07:36.722 --> 07:39.284
So these are the famous
mid-level escalators.

07:39.359 --> 07:43.440
- Ready for the ride of your life?
- Let's do it.

07:53.072 --> 07:56.568
- Technology strikes again.
- What do you mean?

07:56.643 --> 07:59.537
They're on a date
and they're just on their phones.

07:59.612 --> 08:03.108
Maybe they've been going out for a long time
and they just ran out of things to say.

08:03.183 --> 08:06.612
No way.
They're on their third date, at most.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.714
- How do you know?
- The way they're dressed.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.534
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

08:11.791 --> 08:14.082
What were you saying?

08:18.430 --> 08:20.826
Oh, wait, so I actually make a left here.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.428
Yeah, we go down here,
and then you we down peel.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.832
Okay. Right, you know what?
I'm gonna be okay.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.201
I'm gonna... I don't wanna
take up any more of your time.

08:29.276 --> 08:33.205
Yeah, I guess I should... should get back.

08:33.280 --> 08:37.308
- Cool. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, it was nice to meet you too.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.684
Thanks very much.

08:41.253 --> 08:43.196
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:49.261 --> 08:52.991
Hey, you know what?
Another 10 minutes is not gonna hurt.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.360
- Really?
- Yeah, I should make sure you get there.

08:55.435 --> 08:56.728
What a gentleman.

08:56.803 --> 09:00.198
I just don't want to be accused
of anything in case you go missing.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.900
That was really creepy. I'm sorry.

09:01.975 --> 09:05.867
- So creepy.
- Sorry. I take it too far.

09:14.820 --> 09:18.183
So what do you do here in Hong Kong?

09:18.258 --> 09:21.219
Nothing as exciting as designing toys,
that's for sure.

09:21.294 --> 09:24.256
- Come on. What do you do?
- I don't wanna bore you.

09:24.331 --> 09:29.094
All right, I'll guess then. You're an
expat in Hong Kong so I'm thinking...

09:29.169 --> 09:32.130
- Trust fund baby?
- What? Jesus, no.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.066
All right. So you're in finance.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.501
I know we're not the most popular
people in the world right now.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.336
I feel so sorry for you.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.473
Trust me, I'd rather be doing
something creative like you.

09:41.548 --> 09:44.876
- Like what?
- Like writing, actually.

09:44.951 --> 09:46.945
Oh, what did you study in college?

09:47.020 --> 09:51.883
I was a double major,
I studied business and English lit.

09:51.958 --> 09:56.054
- So what happened?
- I guess my practical side won out.

09:56.129 --> 10:00.125
I got my MBA. But now, whenever anybody
asks me what I do for a living,

10:00.200 --> 10:03.895
I feel the need to follow it up with,
but I did study literature in college.

10:03.970 --> 10:08.166
Yeah. I get that. It's not like
I went to school to design toys.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.834
How did you become a toy designer?

10:09.909 --> 10:12.637
Well, out of design school I thought
I was gonna be the next Vera Wang,

10:12.712 --> 10:17.343
but I quickly realized that it is much
easier finding a job designing toys.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.445
- Still want to do something with fashion?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

10:20.520 --> 10:24.950
But instead of designing my own label,
I think I'd love to own my own boutique

10:25.025 --> 10:27.886
and be able to curate all my own pieces.

10:27.961 --> 10:34.100
- Got pretty good style, what's stopping you?
- Thanks. Student loans. Rent.

10:34.175 --> 10:38.697
- The need to eat on a regular basis.
- Eating is highly overrated.

10:38.772 --> 10:42.167
Coming from a guy who probably
has caviar for breakfast.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.035
No, I have cocaine for breakfast.

10:44.110 --> 10:47.969
Caviar is like a...
a late afternoon snack.

10:48.381 --> 10:52.040
So do you still write on the side?

10:52.484 --> 10:55.046
- I'm working on a novel.
- Oh, you're a novelist.

10:55.121 --> 10:58.817
I think you have to finish the book before
you call yourself a novelist, but...

10:58.892 --> 11:01.887
- Kind of.
- What's it called?

11:01.962 --> 11:03.555
Do you really wanna know?

11:03.630 --> 11:07.459
I just keep asking you questions because
I love hearing the sound of my own voice.

11:07.534 --> 11:10.459
You're kind of sassy, you know that?

11:17.276 --> 11:19.104
So?

11:19.379 --> 11:21.236
It's...

11:21.947 --> 11:24.342
it's called, "living on Hong Kong time."

11:24.417 --> 11:27.813
You mean, living on jet lag time?

11:28.088 --> 11:31.955
I had this boss when I was living
in New York, and he said,

11:32.030 --> 11:35.253
"let's hustle people,
it's already tomorrow in Hong Kong."

11:35.328 --> 11:39.172
And that phrase... that phrase
like really stuck with me because...

11:39.247 --> 11:43.128
it's so fast paced here,
it really is already tomorrow.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.230
Guess what?

11:45.505 --> 11:48.133
It's still yesterday in L.A.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.102
That's funny. It's probably very true too.

11:51.177 --> 11:54.873
I think if you gave it a solid chance,
you'd really like it there.

11:54.948 --> 11:58.810
- Yeah, I hear the weather's amazing.
- So what's it about?

11:58.885 --> 12:01.880
It's a far-fetched story
about an American expat

12:01.955 --> 12:05.758
living in Hong Kong,
and all his misadventures.

12:05.833 --> 12:08.253
I've always been intrigued with expats.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.821
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:09.896 --> 12:13.488
I mean, they always gave the impression
that living abroad is so glamorous, but...

12:13.563 --> 12:16.561
when my grandparents immigrated
to The States from Hong Kong,

12:16.636 --> 12:20.265
their journey was anything but glamorous.

12:20.340 --> 12:25.070
And what makes them immigrants,
and you expats?

12:25.145 --> 12:29.540
Well, I guess expats are living
abroad temporarily, and...

12:29.615 --> 12:32.292
- an immigrant is there to stay.
- Okay.

12:32.367 --> 12:36.414
- So how long have you been in Hong Kong?
- 10 years.

12:36.489 --> 12:39.851
Do you have any plans to move back
to New York any time soon?

12:39.926 --> 12:42.154
- Nope.
- Okay, so...

12:42.229 --> 12:46.024
A white investment banker
living abroad is an expat,

12:46.099 --> 12:50.228
and a Chinese restaurant worker
living in Arcadia is an immigrant?

12:50.303 --> 12:52.764
I guess I never really thought
about it that way.

12:52.839 --> 12:58.670
Yeah. It just kind of ironic,
that my grandparents worked so hard

12:58.745 --> 13:02.167
to give us a better life in The States,
and yet here we are.

13:02.242 --> 13:06.278
- We're all just flocking back to Asia.
- It's like most of my friends here.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.044
The far east movement.

13:12.190 --> 13:13.652
This is really pretty.

13:13.727 --> 13:18.456
Yeah, so these are like, the last four
remaining gas lamps in the city.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.358
Cool.

13:20.433 --> 13:23.194
This is the first Starbucks in Hong Kong.

13:23.269 --> 13:26.798
Try that. Ready? Let's try.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.850
Do you guys want me
to take a photo for you?

13:28.925 --> 13:32.704
- Yeah, that'd be so great, thanks so much.
- Yeah, no worries.

13:32.779 --> 13:35.739
Okay. Cheese.

13:37.617 --> 13:41.546
- There you go.
- Did you want a photo?

13:42.321 --> 13:44.992
- No, we just met...
- Yeah, let's get a photo! Come on.

13:45.067 --> 13:48.954
- It'll be fun. Right by the gas lamps.
- Sure. Thank you.

13:49.279 --> 13:50.672
Thanks.

13:51.997 --> 13:55.089
- Say cheese.
- Cheese.

13:55.401 --> 13:58.196
- Thank you. All right, have a good night.
- Thank you. Thank you.

13:58.271 --> 14:01.267
- Bye.
- Bye.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.468
It's pretty cute.

14:03.543 --> 14:06.488
- Yeah. It's not bad.
- I mean, I look good.

14:06.563 --> 14:08.756
I was just gonna say,
you messed up the shot.

14:08.831 --> 14:10.592
I messed up the shot?

14:44.516 --> 14:46.378
- See that?
- Yeah.

14:46.453 --> 14:50.415
- That's my office right there.
- You work inside the Bank of China building?

14:50.490 --> 14:52.851
No, no. This is the H.S.B.C. building.

14:52.926 --> 14:55.649
That right there,
that's the Bank of China building.

14:55.724 --> 14:57.778
Please let me buy you a guidebook.

15:00.832 --> 15:03.862
It almost makes it worth being a banker.

15:04.237 --> 15:08.333
All those lights on in the offices,
it's 11:00 on a Friday night.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.539
Those are all people working.

15:10.614 --> 15:13.903
- It's not as glamorous as it looks.
- Guess not.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.576
So how long have you been in finance for?

15:18.651 --> 15:20.812
Basically the entire time
that I've lived here.

15:20.887 --> 15:23.945
- That's a long time.
- Yeah.

15:24.223 --> 15:26.518
Do you not like it very much?

15:26.593 --> 15:30.752
Well, it's all fun and games
until someone triggers a global recession.

15:33.565 --> 15:37.377
Oh, look at that. They're so cute.

15:39.171 --> 15:42.230
- Should we photobomb?
- Yeah, let's do it.

15:42.741 --> 15:44.567
Cheese!

16:02.094 --> 16:04.242
Not to be confused with
dragon's back, which is a hike.

16:04.317 --> 16:06.191
- Okay.
- I should write a tour guide book.

16:06.266 --> 16:09.060
Yeah, you should.
You're very knowledgeable.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.496
And this is Lan Kwai Fong,
right across the street.

16:12.771 --> 16:14.099
Yeah.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.734
I'm really surprised
you got me here in one piece.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.735
- Oh, you're surprised?
- Yeah.

16:21.081 --> 16:24.809
- Oh, God. I'm sorry, I'm not...
- It's all right.

16:24.884 --> 16:27.479
Whoo. I'm not used to people driving
on the wrong side of the road.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.311
Well, here it's the right side. Come on.

16:33.092 --> 16:34.619
- You saved me.
- I saved your life.

16:34.694 --> 16:38.721
- Thank you.
- Yeah. You owe me.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.305
This is crazy.

17:04.380 --> 17:07.352
Yeah, it's pretty much
like this every night.

17:07.426 --> 17:11.188
- So, which bar are your friends at?
- Club 97.

17:11.262 --> 17:12.323
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:12.397 --> 17:15.093
- God. That's like, that's right around here.
- Oh, God.

17:15.167 --> 17:18.329
Yeah. Now I remember
why I never come here.

17:18.404 --> 17:22.867
A little insane, I know.
And... all right, you see that...

17:22.942 --> 17:26.665
that neon sign,
the purple neon sign? That's...

17:26.741 --> 17:29.004
Hey, Josh?

17:30.249 --> 17:33.277
I had a really great time
getting lost with you tonight.

17:33.352 --> 17:35.654
- Yeah, me too.
- And...

17:35.729 --> 17:38.871
you know, like, I'm gonna see
my friends in the morning and...

17:38.946 --> 17:43.585
I was thinking maybe we could
just grab a drink together instead.

17:44.645 --> 17:47.791
Or, not. If you have to go.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.128
I mean...

17:50.203 --> 17:54.523
No, yeah. I'd love to grab a drink.

17:54.598 --> 17:57.335
Awesome. Should we just go
to one of these joints?

17:57.410 --> 18:00.405
No, no, these are cheesy tourist places,
you don't want this.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.408
- Okay, so where do you want to go?
- Let's get out of the depths of hell.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.673
Come on.

18:17.329 --> 18:18.924
Oh, this is great.

18:18.999 --> 18:21.460
- More your speed, right?
- Yes.

18:21.535 --> 18:24.676
Are you sure
this isn't too civilized for you?

18:28.940 --> 18:31.536
Well, if you hate him so much
why don't you just quit?

18:31.611 --> 18:35.540
- Okay, what would I do for money?
- Write.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.743
It's a hobby,
no one's gonna pay me to write.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.746
How can you fail
with that kind of attitude?

18:41.821 --> 18:45.550
Well, I did tell myself
at the eight year mark I was gonna quit,

18:45.625 --> 18:48.200
but it's hard, you know,
you get accustomed to a certain lifestyle.

18:48.275 --> 18:50.622
Yeah. Sex, drugs, and Gucci suits.

18:50.697 --> 18:55.389
It's actually, sex, drugs,
and number crunching, but it was close.

18:56.135 --> 19:00.565
I keep telling myself every year, this is
the year I'm gonna save enough money.

19:01.740 --> 19:04.036
- But at the end of the year...
- You get that bonus check,

19:04.111 --> 19:06.636
and then you're sucked right back in.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.323
Those high-class problems?

19:11.384 --> 19:14.712
You gotta suck it up.
You've gotta stop being a wuss.

19:14.787 --> 19:19.450
I mean, when are you 100% ready...
ever ready, to do anything?

19:19.525 --> 19:21.819
You know, you've worked
so hard for this safety net.

19:21.894 --> 19:26.255
So if you want to take some time off to
write this book, then you've earned that.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.961
You're absolutely right.

19:34.055 --> 19:36.303
I'm always right.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.906
- Excuse me. I need the ladies' room.
- Yeah.

20:07.756 --> 20:09.081
Hey.

20:22.287 --> 20:25.950
I'll see you soon. Okay. Bye.

20:26.025 --> 20:29.016
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.189
Ready for another round?

20:32.264 --> 20:36.160
I would love to, but actually
I need to get back to the party.

20:36.435 --> 20:39.697
Okay. I get it.
Your friends are probably waiting.

20:39.772 --> 20:43.332
Yeah, and my girlfriend's there too, so.

20:46.345 --> 20:50.691
- Your girlfriend?
- Yeah, probably should get back.

21:01.910 --> 21:03.602
Yeah.

21:06.331 --> 21:08.756
Thanks for the drinks.

21:10.369 --> 21:13.949
Wait, Ruby. Ruby.

21:14.724 --> 21:17.268
- Hold on. Ruby.
- Yeah.

21:17.343 --> 21:20.725
- You okay?
- Of course I am. Why wouldn't I be?

21:20.880 --> 21:22.907
You sure?

21:26.551 --> 21:27.979
Let me just get this right.

21:28.054 --> 21:33.284
You left your girlfriend at a bar
so you can come to another bar

21:33.359 --> 21:35.953
- with another girl?
- It was a big birthday party.

21:36.028 --> 21:39.357
- It's not like I left her alone.
- Okay. That totally makes it okay then.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.693
I could have lied to you
right now, but I didn't.

21:41.768 --> 21:44.829
- No, you should have just told me earlier.
- What was I supposed to say?

21:44.904 --> 21:48.732
Sure, I'll walk you to your friends,
but by the way, I have a girlfriend?

21:48.807 --> 21:51.055
I didn't ask you if you have a boyfriend.

21:51.410 --> 21:54.067
Do you... do you have a boyfriend?

21:54.142 --> 21:57.572
No. Because if I did,
I wouldn't be here right now.

21:58.817 --> 22:04.048
I wasn't planning on this, okay?
I don't do this type of thing ever.

22:04.823 --> 22:09.870
I'm trying to apologize.
If I misled you in any way, I'm sorry.

22:11.830 --> 22:15.159
It's fine. I'm leaving tomorrow,

22:15.234 --> 22:17.925
don't even worry about it.

22:20.338 --> 22:24.569
Well, I mean, should we exchange
contact information now?

22:24.644 --> 22:27.264
Or how does this... what do we do?
I don't know how does this work?

22:27.339 --> 22:31.909
Really? God, I feel really bad
for your girlfriend.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.301
Don't. Okay?

22:33.376 --> 22:36.180
This was such innocent stuff compared
to what she was doing back at the bar.

22:36.255 --> 22:40.362
She was flirting with a bunch of aussies,
taking shots, completely embarrassing me.

22:44.112 --> 22:45.740
Whose birthday was it?

22:51.001 --> 22:52.697
Yeah.

22:52.772 --> 22:55.300
This night just gets better and better.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.754
That sounds worse than it really is.

23:00.580 --> 23:03.541
You know, I have to say,

23:03.616 --> 23:06.741
thank you for a really interesting night.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.025
Ruby?

25:24.823 --> 25:26.684
Josh.

25:26.959 --> 25:31.156
- Hey.
- I... I can't believe that it's you.

25:31.931 --> 25:34.125
How are...

25:34.400 --> 25:36.286
- How are you?
- How... how are you?

25:36.361 --> 25:38.663
- I'm good. Yeah.
- Good, good.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.698
- Good.
- What are you doing here?

25:40.773 --> 25:43.668
I'm just picking up
some clothes in Kowloon.

25:43.743 --> 25:46.003
No, I mean,
what are you doing in Hong Kong?

25:46.865 --> 25:49.974
I... I actually live here now.

25:50.449 --> 25:52.377
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.579
Yeah, I got a promotion.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.815
- Well, congrats.
- Thank you.

25:57.890 --> 26:02.633
Yeah, the tradeoff was I had to come
live here for a year, so, here I am.

26:03.228 --> 26:06.090
I can't believe you...
wait, you live here, in Hong Kong?

26:06.165 --> 26:08.459
I'm sorry,
should I have notified you first?

26:08.534 --> 26:10.527
I thought that next time
we were gonna see each other,

26:10.602 --> 26:12.296
you were gonna give me a Lady Ba-ba.

26:12.371 --> 26:16.430
God, I really hope you weren't holding
your breath since last year.

26:18.210 --> 26:21.305
You know,
I should apologize about last year.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.508
- About that...
- Don't even... don't even worry about it.

26:24.583 --> 26:29.246
- It was... it's fine. It's not a big deal.
- No, I was... I was kind of a jerk.

26:29.321 --> 26:32.680
Yes, you were. A big jerk.

26:33.358 --> 26:35.886
All right, all right.

26:35.961 --> 26:38.656
God, I have to know,
how mad was your girlfriend

26:38.731 --> 26:41.659
when you finally showed up to that bar?

26:41.734 --> 26:45.760
- Yeah, she wasn't happy, that's for sure.
- Yeah, I bet.

26:46.805 --> 26:50.568
- Did you guys work things out?
- Are you asking if we're still together?

26:50.643 --> 26:54.805
Nah, why don't we just hang out for a couple
hours, and you can just surprise me later.

26:55.180 --> 26:58.476
- It's more dramatic that way.
- Yeah, fair enough. I deserve that.

26:58.551 --> 27:03.777
- Yes. Yes, we're still together.
- Oh, good for you. Good for you.

27:10.661 --> 27:15.660
- So, how about you? Are you seeing anyone?
- Yeah, I am. I am.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.495
What?

27:17.770 --> 27:21.298
You let me ride the ferry with you this
whole time you didn't mention, not once,

27:21.373 --> 27:24.632
- that you had a boyfriend.
- Yeah, I guess we're even now.

27:26.144 --> 27:29.941
- Did you meet him here, or...
- No, no. Back in L.A. Yeah, he's in L.A.

27:30.016 --> 27:32.343
- So it's long distance, then?
- Yeah, it is.

27:32.418 --> 27:35.306
Yeah, well, you know,
I'm only doing this for a year. So...

27:35.381 --> 27:39.462
I figured if we can weather this,
we can weather anything.

27:40.792 --> 27:42.886
I'm sorry, I can't believe...

27:42.961 --> 27:46.456
- I never ride the ferry. This is crazy.
- Yeah, this is weird.

27:46.531 --> 27:50.312
- It's weird, right?
- It's weird. It's weird. I never go to Cat Lune.

28:00.445 --> 28:02.603
- So, it was really good running into you.
- Yeah.

28:02.678 --> 28:05.671
I'm like... I was really glad
we got to catch up.

28:05.746 --> 28:07.531
Definitely.

28:08.120 --> 28:11.181
So... where are you off to now?

28:11.256 --> 28:14.688
- I'm picking up clothes.
- Oh, right. Right. Where?

28:14.763 --> 28:16.415
Chungking Mansion.

28:16.490 --> 28:19.190
You need me to come with you?

28:19.265 --> 28:21.312
- No, I think I can handle it.
- Are you sure?

28:21.387 --> 28:23.360
Yeah, yep, I've got a GPS now.

28:23.435 --> 28:26.931
- No, I mean, that's a sketchy area.
- Really?

28:27.006 --> 28:30.497
Look, I think your boyfriend
would want me to go with you.

28:30.810 --> 28:34.870
I'd be doing him a solid.
Minding the perimeter, and shit.

28:38.750 --> 28:42.967
Okay. Whatever. If you must.

28:43.488 --> 28:46.183
- It's this way.
- Yeah, that's...

28:46.258 --> 28:49.850
- I just thought I'd dropped something.
- Yeah, no. Totally.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.726
Oh, did you see that guy?

29:43.801 --> 29:47.811
- That guy, that bleeding guy.
- What are you talking about?

29:47.886 --> 29:50.648
Are you sure we're in the right place, most of
these tailor shops are on the ground floor.

29:50.723 --> 29:53.080
Yeah, we're right here.

29:59.964 --> 30:03.844
Sorry. I'm here to pick up a suit.

30:06.587 --> 30:08.380
You really didn't see that guy?

30:12.010 --> 30:13.868
Okay.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.585
So, who's the suit for?

30:32.697 --> 30:35.522
- Are we picking up a suit for your boyfriend?
- You said you wanted to come.

30:35.597 --> 30:37.476
- What's his name?
- Suit not ready.

30:37.551 --> 30:39.322
- Wait, what?
- Suit not ready.

30:39.397 --> 30:42.132
No, no, no, no, I called this morning,
and you said it'd be done today.

30:42.207 --> 30:46.166
Sorry, suit not ready. Next week, come back.

31:03.328 --> 31:05.122
Okay.

31:05.797 --> 31:09.159
Your suit will be ready this weekend,
and you're getting a 15% discount.

31:09.234 --> 31:11.058
What?

31:12.904 --> 31:14.995
Thank you.

31:16.174 --> 31:18.035
- What was that?
- What?

31:18.110 --> 31:21.805
That was amazing. I didn't know
you could speak Cantonese so well.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.441
Hey, I told you I'd come in handy.

31:24.516 --> 31:28.545
- It's so weird watching you speak Chinese.
- It's weird watching you speak English.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.915
- Whatever, that's different.
- How is it different?

31:30.990 --> 31:32.983
It's different because
I grew up in the States.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.386
Well, I spent the last ten years
of my life here.

31:35.461 --> 31:39.016
It's still weird. No, only because
I don't speak any Chinese.

31:39.091 --> 31:43.327
Yeah, if it makes you feel any better,
I don't speak a lick of Yiddish.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.964
- My grandmother thinks that's mashugana.
- What does that mean?

31:47.039 --> 31:48.830
I have no idea.

31:51.909 --> 31:53.701
Okay.

31:55.179 --> 31:57.505
Okay. Well, I should probably
get going. But, thank you.

31:57.580 --> 31:59.323
- All right.
- Thanks.

31:59.398 --> 32:01.320
Hey, I...

32:02.554 --> 32:06.149
I gotta be at this thing in a few hours,
but I've got some time to kill.

32:06.224 --> 32:07.470
Oh, no.

32:07.545 --> 32:09.775
You don't even know what I was gonna say.

32:09.850 --> 32:12.716
Yeah. It started to sound eerily familiar.

32:13.135 --> 32:14.508
One drink.

32:16.501 --> 32:18.893
Totally platonic.

32:23.974 --> 32:27.171
Okay. Fine, fine. But only because...

32:27.646 --> 32:30.107
You got my boyfriend a discount.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.509
- That's all it takes?
- My boyfriend...

32:32.584 --> 32:34.412
Yeah.

32:34.987 --> 32:37.444
A really good discount.

32:47.865 --> 32:50.027
I mean, look at this here.

32:50.102 --> 32:52.429
Is this where you take all the ladies?

32:52.504 --> 32:55.532
When I'm not haggling for their
boyfriend's menswear, yes, yes.

32:55.607 --> 32:59.603
- This is... this is where I take the ladies.
- Oh, it's super swanky.

32:59.678 --> 33:03.411
- Don't worry, I'll pay for it.
- Using the good, old expense account?

33:03.486 --> 33:04.541
I wish.

33:04.616 --> 33:07.978
You know, technically it's okay, because
I am now officially a customer of H.S.B.C.

33:08.053 --> 33:11.112
- So you can totally write it off.
- Well, I don't have an expense account.

33:12.590 --> 33:14.351
- I quit my job.
- What?

33:14.426 --> 33:16.221
Yeah.

33:17.394 --> 33:18.441
When?

33:18.616 --> 33:21.291
Right after I met
this sassy girl from L.A.

33:21.366 --> 33:24.828
- No, you actually took me seriously?
- I'm a pauper now because of you.

33:24.903 --> 33:27.865
And you're making me feel bad?

33:27.940 --> 33:29.667
- You want a drink?
- Yeah. Hi.

33:29.742 --> 33:32.603
- What can I get for you?
- I'll take a glass of rose, please.

33:32.678 --> 33:36.137
Yeah, a vodka Redbull.
- Can I have a credit card?

33:36.212 --> 33:38.375
- Oh, yeah.
- No, here, I'll get it. No, seriously.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.547
- No, no, no, no. Please.
- No, it's my treat.

33:40.622 --> 33:43.443
No, you got it last time.

33:43.788 --> 33:45.616
I mean, that's a first.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.715
A girl buying me a drink in Hong Kong.

33:49.493 --> 33:52.222
- So you don't have an office anymore.
- No, I don't have an office.

33:52.297 --> 33:55.359
Don't have a secretary,
I just work at home.

33:55.434 --> 33:57.794
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers to this.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.561
Even though I only said one drink.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.902
But, I'm just trying my best to...

34:04.977 --> 34:07.671
- to treat it like a day job, you know?
- What do you mean?

34:07.746 --> 34:11.371
Like I clock in at the same time
every day. You know, I put the hours in.

34:11.446 --> 34:15.746
Good. And do you ever get writers block?

34:15.821 --> 34:19.049
I read somewhere that if you're blocked, it
means you're writing about the wrong things.

34:19.123 --> 34:22.753
Okay. It looks like someone's been
googling quotes about writers block

34:22.828 --> 34:25.319
instead of actually writing.

34:26.063 --> 34:29.260
Busted. I mean,
who knows what will happen.

34:29.335 --> 34:32.576
How many unpublished books are
out there just waiting to be ignored.

34:32.650 --> 34:35.032
- Don't do that. Don't do that.
- What?

34:35.107 --> 34:38.935
You should be proud of yourself.
You took a chance, and you went for it.

34:39.010 --> 34:43.137
You know? You're never gonna have
to look back and wonder "what if."

34:44.215 --> 34:45.773
Thanks.

34:49.120 --> 34:52.649
You know, I always knew
we'd be great friends someday.

34:52.724 --> 34:56.353
Don't get too ahead of yourself. Let's see
how the rest of the night pans out first.

34:56.428 --> 34:59.783
- No way. I'm not taking that risk.
- What are you doing?

34:59.858 --> 35:01.359
- I'm facebooking you.
- No.

35:01.434 --> 35:03.890
What is your last name?

35:05.235 --> 35:07.394
What is it?

35:07.739 --> 35:09.464
- It's Lin.
- Ruby Lin?

35:09.539 --> 35:11.819
- Yes, it is.
- I like that.

35:12.494 --> 35:14.535
Ruby Lin.

35:15.012 --> 35:17.518
Okay. Is that you?

35:18.749 --> 35:20.637
Yep.

35:21.177 --> 35:23.013
Cute pic.

35:32.363 --> 35:36.526
"Facebook friend request
from Joshua Rosenberg."

35:36.601 --> 35:40.064
- Your last name is Rosenberg?
- It is.

35:40.339 --> 35:43.900
- Could you be any more Jewish?
- Could you be any more racist?

35:43.975 --> 35:45.902
I'm just Joshing you.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.638
Okay, we're not gonna say that joke again.
That's an awful joke.

35:48.713 --> 35:51.809
- I've been waiting all night to say that.
- That's an...

35:52.851 --> 35:54.744
This is the part where you hit
the "accept" button.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.543
I don't know about that.

35:56.618 --> 36:00.684
I just don't know if our relationship is
ready to be taken to the next level yet.

36:00.759 --> 36:03.615
Okay, this is the part where you hit
the button... you just hit the button.

36:04.062 --> 36:06.142
- I'm gonna think about it.
- What? Really?

36:06.217 --> 36:11.258
Yeah, really. Excuse me.
I have to use the ladies' room.

36:17.375 --> 36:19.566
So cold.

37:02.052 --> 37:03.580
Ready to go?

37:03.655 --> 37:05.549
I can't wait to stalk you
on Facebook later.

37:05.624 --> 37:08.849
Stalking is okay, poking is not allowed.

37:26.510 --> 37:30.737
Look at this skyline.
They go all in on the light show.

37:31.716 --> 37:34.678
It's easy to see why people
fall in love with it.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.581
Yeah.

37:37.456 --> 37:39.346
But?

37:40.291 --> 37:43.587
I just don't think
that I'm in love with it yet.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.789
- No?
- No.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.111
Let me bitch about a couple of things
and I'll never bring it up ever again.

37:49.217 --> 37:50.394
Okay. Hit me.

37:50.469 --> 37:54.498
I just think the people here
are a little superficial...

37:54.573 --> 37:57.701
that they only care about money,
or the perception of having money.

37:57.776 --> 38:00.771
- Not everyone.
- For example, our company receptionist

38:00.846 --> 38:03.073
has multiple Louis Vuitton purses,

38:03.148 --> 38:05.642
and I know for a fact,
even though it's none of my business,

38:05.717 --> 38:08.845
that just one of those purses
costs more than her monthly salary.

38:08.920 --> 38:12.082
- Yeah, she's got her priorities straight.
- She doesn't even have her own apartment.

38:12.157 --> 38:15.285
- She lives with her parents, she's 35.
- That's a cultural thing, though.

38:15.360 --> 38:19.489
And when you're saving money
on rent, you can buy purses.

38:19.564 --> 38:22.392
It's always raining
at the worst times possible.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.861
And there's like a random
typhoon every other week.

38:24.936 --> 38:26.796
But if it's a signal 8, you get off work.

38:26.871 --> 38:30.200
- I miss Netflix.
- Just run a VPM program.

38:30.275 --> 38:33.670
And the Mexican food, not good.

38:33.745 --> 38:36.173
Yeah, okay, that one I'll give you.

38:36.248 --> 38:39.910
I mean, we live
in a major cosmopolitan city

38:39.985 --> 38:43.547
and, yet, they still make nachos
with doritos and yogurt.

38:43.622 --> 38:47.214
Ruby, stop. Would you look at this?

38:47.775 --> 38:50.066
Look at this.

38:51.128 --> 38:54.521
You're harping about nachos? Really?

38:55.599 --> 38:59.629
I know, but aren't there just some foods
that you miss from back home?

38:59.704 --> 39:04.869
What's a good slice, every now and then?
But dim sum? It's so much better.

39:05.944 --> 39:08.705
- Maybe I'm just homesick.
- Maybe you haven't been to the right places.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.574
Like where?

39:10.649 --> 39:12.075
- Are you hungry?
- I'm always hungry.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.711
All right. I'm gonna take you
where the locals eat.

39:14.786 --> 39:17.277
Okay, there's just one thing.

39:18.223 --> 39:22.186
I can't eat chicken feet. Like, I've tried.
I've just looked at it. I can't do it.

39:22.261 --> 39:24.421
We'll save that for another time
when you're ready.

39:24.496 --> 39:28.091
I'm gonna take you to
the best seafood spot in Jordan.

39:28.466 --> 39:30.360
All right.

39:30.635 --> 39:35.129
- Are you paying?
- Yeah, it's cheap. I got this.

39:51.322 --> 39:54.718
A post-it, or a curling iron, or...

39:54.793 --> 39:57.750
The one that I always think about
is like, the envelope,

39:57.825 --> 39:59.956
with the little window on the envelope.

40:00.031 --> 40:04.124
Oh, the window on the envelope?
I'm more into the, like...

40:06.236 --> 40:08.598
- What?
- Nothing. Sorry.

40:08.673 --> 40:12.402
Look, don't... could you stop
being so judgmental?

40:12.477 --> 40:15.005
- I'm not being judgmental.
- You don't know if they're a couple.

40:15.080 --> 40:19.625
- They could be like co-workers or something.
- I'm just... Really?

40:19.700 --> 40:22.913
- Do you do that with your co-workers?
- Oh, yes, actually.

40:22.988 --> 40:26.016
- You do? Of course you do.
- That's a cultural thing here as well

40:26.091 --> 40:29.916
that you will become accustomed to.

40:32.813 --> 40:36.684
Do you think anyone thinks anything
of us when they see us together?

40:38.836 --> 40:41.262
- I... no, I don't think that...
- Really?

40:41.337 --> 40:42.967
- No. No.
- No?

40:43.042 --> 40:45.769
You don't think that people assume
that I'm a gold digger?

40:45.844 --> 40:47.470
- A gold digger?
- Yeah.

40:47.545 --> 40:51.427
No, if anything, you're employed,
and you make more money than me,

40:51.502 --> 40:54.711
so, they'd probably think
you're my sugar mama.

40:54.786 --> 40:58.197
I mean, obviously I make more money
than you, but they don't know that.

40:58.272 --> 41:02.352
- "Obviously" you do?
- They don't know that.

41:02.827 --> 41:06.723
I just... I know...
I know I'm being super judgmental,

41:06.798 --> 41:10.427
I apologize, but, I can't help it.

41:10.502 --> 41:13.830
I just... I see couples like this,
and I make assumptions.

41:13.905 --> 41:19.669
And I hate that I perpetuate the stereotype
even further by dating a white guy.

41:19.744 --> 41:22.769
- What?
- What?

41:23.080 --> 41:25.942
- So, Greg's a white guy?
- Who's Greg?

41:26.017 --> 41:30.310
He's your boyfriend. You never
told me his name so I just gave him one.

41:30.588 --> 41:34.851
Yeah. Greg. I like that name.
Yeah, Greg's a white guy.

41:34.926 --> 41:37.387
- So you're one of those Asian girls?
- What?

41:37.462 --> 41:41.758
- Yeah. That only date white guys.
- I do not only date white guys.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.858
- Really?
- No.

41:45.536 --> 41:49.799
Like, the majority have been white,
but it's not on purpose.

41:49.874 --> 41:52.435
- It's totally coincidental.
- Oh, no, it's okay.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.438
I've had a few Asian girlfriends,
and suddenly I...

41:55.513 --> 42:00.744
like, I'm the white guy with
an Asian fetish. I fucking hate that.

42:00.819 --> 42:03.113
You gotta get used to couples
like this, it's Hong Kong.

42:03.188 --> 42:05.237
- I know.
- It's east meets west.

42:05.312 --> 42:09.286
- They're everywhere. All right?
- You're right. You're right.

42:09.561 --> 42:12.155
There's this couple in my office...

42:12.430 --> 42:15.725
he's a white guy, and he's married
to this beautiful Chinese woman,

42:15.800 --> 42:17.393
and when they first started dating,

42:17.468 --> 42:20.730
he didn't know how to speak any Chinese,

42:20.805 --> 42:22.666
and she couldn't speak any English.

42:22.741 --> 42:25.035
So like, the first like, six dates,

42:25.110 --> 42:28.238
they brought...
they brought on like a translator.

42:28.313 --> 42:29.906
- Could you imagine...
- Like a person?

42:29.981 --> 42:31.462
Yeah!

42:31.537 --> 42:34.344
A translator. So it was like a table
for three instead of a table for two.

42:34.419 --> 42:37.681
Like, it's so... awkward.

42:37.756 --> 42:40.150
I felt so bad for the translator.

42:40.225 --> 42:44.688
I know. There's a couple like that
in my building, and, they...

42:44.763 --> 42:49.692
everywhere they go, they get by,
but they use like, a, like an app.

42:49.767 --> 42:53.793
- Like a Google translator app.
- It's seen that before, too.

42:54.404 --> 42:56.232
Yeah.

42:56.607 --> 43:00.303
Well, do you think that you'd ever be able
to be in a relationship like that?

43:00.378 --> 43:04.007
Please. I find it hard enough
to date girls who do speak English.

43:04.082 --> 43:06.009
Yeah? How so?

43:06.084 --> 43:09.179
It's just like...
it's not a language barrier,

43:09.254 --> 43:12.319
- but it's like a cultural barrier.
- Yeah.

43:12.394 --> 43:15.885
TV shows, movies, music I grew up on,

43:15.960 --> 43:20.390
- like it just goes way over their heads.
- Yeah. Yeah, I feel you on that one.

43:20.465 --> 43:24.660
It's been really hard for me to connect,
you know, with my friends at that level.

43:24.735 --> 43:27.597
I just want to be with somebody
who understands what I'm talking about

43:27.672 --> 43:32.234
when I say, like... "no soup for you!"

43:32.334 --> 43:34.671
- Don't piss off the soup Nazi.
- Yes.

43:34.746 --> 43:36.339
It's the best soup in town.

43:36.414 --> 43:41.177
Okay, I had this ex girlfriend, and I was
trying to watch "Seinfield" with her,

43:41.252 --> 43:43.594
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Because I had like, the DVDs,

43:43.669 --> 43:47.216
She was like, "I don't get it,"
it just seems, like, about nothing.

43:47.291 --> 43:50.520
- And I'm like...
- But that's the whole point.

43:50.595 --> 43:52.686
Exactly.

44:24.696 --> 44:26.289
- Yes.
- These are cool.

44:26.364 --> 44:28.604
Put it like that.

44:28.679 --> 44:31.094
- And you can take, like, a selfie.
- Oh, really?

44:31.169 --> 44:33.426
Here, you ready?

44:34.905 --> 44:39.335
That's awesome. I need this in my life.

44:39.710 --> 44:42.638
You know, they said it was 120 for both.

44:42.713 --> 44:44.847
80.

44:44.922 --> 44:46.262
- No?
- 80.

44:46.337 --> 44:48.478
She's tough.
We're gonna walk away empty handed.

44:48.653 --> 44:51.781
That's the thing about negotiating,
you have to be okay to walk away.

44:51.856 --> 44:53.717
Okay.

44:54.092 --> 44:56.650
We'll buy it here for 120.

45:04.469 --> 45:05.764
How do you do that?

45:08.405 --> 45:10.834
- You gotta work on your negotiation skills.
- I'm terrible.

45:10.909 --> 45:14.404
Like, if they say 25,
that really means, like, 10.

45:14.679 --> 45:16.804
- 160, 160.
- No, not selling.

45:16.879 --> 45:18.673
- 160? 170.
- 180.

45:18.748 --> 45:22.650
- 170.
- 150, you're screwing this whole thing up.

45:29.793 --> 45:33.135
- No.
- It feels like the Batmobile.

45:37.534 --> 45:41.197
160. 160. Do you want it?

45:41.272 --> 45:44.032
- 160?
- Yeah!

45:45.610 --> 45:48.337
There's some cute little trinkets.

45:49.792 --> 45:51.971
Wait, this is...

45:52.449 --> 45:55.578
This is Moos Like Jagger.
Wait, this is mine, too.

45:55.653 --> 45:58.982
- You designed this?
- Yes, I did. Where did you get these?

45:59.057 --> 46:00.716
- What are these doing here?
- Very cute.

46:00.791 --> 46:03.723
Yeah, they are very cute. I designed them.
He's totally ripping me off.

46:03.798 --> 46:05.889
- Well...
- Do I call the police?

46:05.964 --> 46:08.758
You can take it as a compliment.

46:08.833 --> 46:11.561
You know you've made it
when you've been ripped off in China.

46:11.636 --> 46:13.997
They're cute. Cute. It's a deal?

46:14.072 --> 46:17.400
- Very cheap. Yeah, real cheap.
- They're very cheap. Very good.

46:17.475 --> 46:21.304
Okay. Yeah, you're right.

46:21.679 --> 46:24.918
- It's a silver lining.
- Hey, man, do you have the Lady Ba-ba?

46:24.993 --> 46:28.444
- Okay, thank you. Thank you.
- 'Cause I can't find that anywhere.

46:28.519 --> 46:31.344
We're not gonna support that.

46:33.457 --> 46:35.318
All right.

46:35.393 --> 46:38.454
- This is the place.
- Yum.

46:38.529 --> 46:41.855
Really looking forward to this fresh crap.

46:45.803 --> 46:48.328
Don't worry about that.

46:49.039 --> 46:51.067
This is great.

46:51.342 --> 46:53.434
Thank you.

46:54.444 --> 46:56.539
Oh, my God.

46:56.614 --> 46:58.675
- I love this.
- Told you.

46:58.750 --> 47:03.508
I know. I was really hesitant at first,
but this is... this is really good.

47:03.583 --> 47:06.516
- It's really good.
- I can see that you like it.

47:07.091 --> 47:08.734
- You know how I can tell?
- How?

47:08.809 --> 47:11.601
Because you have it all over your face.

47:12.630 --> 47:15.653
- Did I get it?
- No. Other side. Other side.

47:15.728 --> 47:18.394
- Did I get it?
- No. Here. Hold on.

47:18.469 --> 47:20.996
It's been driving me crazy.

47:21.071 --> 47:23.745
- I think I got it. There you go.
- Thank you.

47:23.820 --> 47:26.302
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry. I'm a messy eater.

47:26.377 --> 47:29.639
Hey, to eat politely is not to eat at all.

47:29.714 --> 47:34.240
- Is that another Josh quote?
- It is. Yours truly.

47:35.785 --> 47:39.645
- So, do you come here often?
- It sounds like you're hitting on me.

47:40.658 --> 47:45.121
- I used to. Not so much anymore.
- Yeah, why not?

47:45.196 --> 47:48.672
I don't know,
Sam doesn't really like it that much.

47:51.201 --> 47:54.253
- Sam is your...
- Sorry, Sam, she's my girlfriend.

47:54.328 --> 47:56.991
- Sorry. Yeah. Samantha.
- Yeah.

47:58.108 --> 48:00.223
Not her kind of place?

48:00.298 --> 48:03.740
No, not really. She likes...

48:03.815 --> 48:07.276
more like, Sushi and French places

48:07.351 --> 48:10.279
- with ceilings and comfortable seats.
- Air conditioning?

48:10.354 --> 48:12.949
Yeah, air conditioning. Expensive bills.

48:13.024 --> 48:15.615
Sounds like a delicate flower.

48:16.626 --> 48:20.256
No, no. She's...
she's tough as nails, actually.

48:20.331 --> 48:22.088
How?

48:22.933 --> 48:27.043
She grew up in China, not poor, but...

48:27.118 --> 48:30.816
kinda poor, but she managed to...
make her way through college

48:30.891 --> 48:35.341
- on a... on a full scholarship to U Penn.
- That's really impressive.

48:35.416 --> 48:37.807
Yeah, she's worked really hard
to get to where she's at.

48:37.882 --> 48:41.210
- What does she do?
- She's a banker.

48:42.885 --> 48:45.281
- Yeah.
- Okay.

48:45.356 --> 48:48.284
And how did she take
you quitting your job?

48:49.491 --> 48:51.598
You know.

48:51.796 --> 48:54.872
- Not so good?
- Yeah. Like...

48:54.947 --> 48:57.827
For someone like her who's worked
so hard for every opportunity,

48:57.902 --> 49:01.631
I think it's difficult for her to understand
why someone would just throw it all away.

49:01.706 --> 49:05.932
- You're not throwing it away, technically.
- Yeah. I know I'm not. But...

49:07.878 --> 49:10.951
It's an ongoing discussion. I guess.

49:16.253 --> 49:18.247
All right. I've had a couple beers...

49:18.322 --> 49:22.153
I'm gonna say something I usually probably
wouldn't have. So please don't be offended.

49:22.228 --> 49:24.053
Okay.

49:24.128 --> 49:28.997
I just think it's a little weird that she
doesn't understand why you want to write,

49:29.072 --> 49:32.395
or why she doesn't come to one
of your favorite restaurants.

49:32.470 --> 49:35.081
Well, do you and Greg agree on everything?

49:35.156 --> 49:37.934
No, we don't, but you know,
we've been together long enough

49:38.009 --> 49:41.137
where we've kind of ironed out
those important things.

49:41.212 --> 49:44.070
"Those things," meaning what?

49:45.715 --> 49:47.677
You know, it's not just
about likes, or dislikes.

49:47.752 --> 49:51.380
It's about supporting each other
through your goals and dreams.

49:51.455 --> 49:53.366
She supports me.

49:53.441 --> 49:57.350
I don't want to give you the wrong
impression that she doesn't support me.

49:58.428 --> 50:00.053
It's...

50:19.916 --> 50:23.146
That's another thing
I can't seem to get used to.

50:23.221 --> 50:25.045
What?

50:27.959 --> 50:30.917
You get to a place
where you don't even notice.

50:32.162 --> 50:34.354
I can't imagine not noticing.

50:41.439 --> 50:43.332
Sorry.

50:43.807 --> 50:45.799
Should we get out of here?

50:54.718 --> 50:56.746
Hey, so, I'm really sorry about before.

50:56.821 --> 51:01.350
I didn't realize that you
and Sam were so serious.

51:01.425 --> 51:03.319
We've only been going out for two years.

51:03.394 --> 51:05.421
- Two years is a long time.
- It's not that long.

51:05.496 --> 51:07.991
It's long enough for the two of you
to hit milestones together.

51:08.066 --> 51:09.025
I guess.

51:09.100 --> 51:11.827
Did you guys do the whole
meet-the-parents thing?

51:11.902 --> 51:16.832
- She's met mine, yeah.
- But... you haven't met hers?

51:16.907 --> 51:19.100
They don't know I exist.

51:19.175 --> 51:23.940
It's complicated. They're not crazy
about their daughter dating a gweilo.

51:24.015 --> 51:28.011
But, no, I mean, things
are good with us. Overall.

51:28.086 --> 51:31.547
She's got a lot that she wants
to accomplish career-wise.

51:31.622 --> 51:35.648
Neither one of us is
really ready to settle down yet.

51:38.227 --> 51:40.753
Plus, she's a little younger.

51:41.398 --> 51:44.293
How much younger is a little younger?

51:44.368 --> 51:46.629
Does it really matter?

51:46.704 --> 51:51.467
Josh. Which birthday was she
celebrating when we first met?

51:51.542 --> 51:53.169
- 24th.
- 24th.

51:53.244 --> 51:55.872
Yeah. I'm not that much older, okay.

51:55.947 --> 51:58.140
- So typical.
- What?

51:58.215 --> 52:01.911
I... you're practically a decade older,
but that's okay.

52:01.986 --> 52:05.148
It's not like I'm one of these 60-year-old
guys chasing around 20-year-olds.

52:05.223 --> 52:08.251
Yeah, not yet.
But how do you think it all starts?

52:08.326 --> 52:11.153
Okay, what is the right age
that I should be dating, then?

52:11.228 --> 52:13.055
Let's see...

52:13.130 --> 52:15.424
I would say if you're 35,

52:15.499 --> 52:19.595
- late twenties, early thirties.
- How old are you again?

52:19.670 --> 52:22.832
- That has nothing to do with this conversation.
- Just curious. How old are you?

52:22.907 --> 52:24.654
I'm 30.

52:24.729 --> 52:27.100
How age-appropriate.

52:43.893 --> 52:46.622
Do you know anything
about Cantonese opera?

52:46.697 --> 52:49.956
Nope. Are they any good?

52:50.834 --> 52:52.939
I don't know.

52:54.238 --> 52:56.599
These are your people.
This is your cultural heritage.

52:56.674 --> 53:00.433
- You should know this.
- I don't know anything about Chinese opera.

53:09.486 --> 53:12.831
Well, from one starving artist to another,
I should probably tip her.

53:12.906 --> 53:15.430
That's very nice of you.

53:18.562 --> 53:20.823
- Thank you.
- It's kind of catchy.

53:20.898 --> 53:23.555
Yeah, it's grown on me.

53:29.739 --> 53:32.008
When are you gonna take
your own advice drop the Teddy bears,

53:32.083 --> 53:34.154
and open up a clothing boutique?

53:34.229 --> 53:38.240
I don't know. I think I may stick
with singing animals for a while.

53:38.315 --> 53:40.409
- Really?
- Yeah.

53:40.484 --> 53:43.245
You know, for a long time
I held fashion in such a high regard,

53:43.320 --> 53:46.248
but it was actually much
more difficult constructing

53:46.323 --> 53:49.719
a three dimensional toy
than it is a piece of clothing.

53:49.794 --> 53:52.021
I just don't think that I appreciated it

53:52.096 --> 53:56.559
because I didn't really spend a lot
of time in the factories, but now I do.

53:56.634 --> 53:59.995
- Because last year, you were kind of...
- What? Above it all?

54:00.070 --> 54:02.898
- Yeah.
- Shut up.

54:02.973 --> 54:06.736
Well, you know, I used to dream of like,
seeing my designs at Bergdorf's and Barneys,

54:06.811 --> 54:11.206
but, now I get to see it at every Wal-Mart,
and drug store chain in the country.

54:11.281 --> 54:14.144
- They buy quantity.
- Exactly.

54:14.219 --> 54:16.645
This one time, I was at Walgreens,

54:16.720 --> 54:20.249
I saw this father buying one
of my toys for his daughter...

54:20.324 --> 54:24.183
actually, it, like,
brought a little tear to my eye.

54:25.362 --> 54:29.458
- I know, it's super cheesy, but...
- It's not cheesy, it's cute.

54:29.533 --> 54:32.428
Hello, hello. Come, come, come.

54:32.503 --> 54:34.930
My birdy tell you fortune, okay?

54:35.005 --> 54:38.367
- He's a poor fortune teller.
- That's like a tourist trap.

54:38.442 --> 54:41.003
Oh, yeah, it's so awesome.

54:41.078 --> 54:43.106
Please sit down.

54:43.181 --> 54:48.110
Right. Shall we speak in French, Italian,
German, English, American English?

54:48.185 --> 54:50.146
- English.
- American English, yes.

54:50.221 --> 54:54.517
- Okay. So... Lady first. Okay?
- Yes.

54:54.592 --> 54:59.421
What would you like to know?
Fortune, health, study, love, what?

54:59.496 --> 55:01.424
- Love.
- Of course.

55:01.499 --> 55:04.107
- Ladies want to know about love.
- Always.

55:04.182 --> 55:09.834
Okay. First, you shall move the cards.
Okay? Because it's your fortune.

55:11.674 --> 55:13.489
There.

55:13.878 --> 55:15.738
Okay.

55:15.813 --> 55:19.242
- I will give it to the birdy to pick. Okay?
- Okay.

55:19.317 --> 55:21.777
The birdy will decide your fortune.

55:21.852 --> 55:25.848
We put it here and then
we let the birdy out. Okay?

55:26.519 --> 55:29.182
- Hey.
- Oh, my God, it's so cute.

55:30.428 --> 55:32.244
Okay, that's pretty cute.

55:35.899 --> 55:38.494
- What's he doing?
- He's indecisive.

55:38.569 --> 55:42.732
- Oh, my God! That was awesome.
- Okay, I'm impressed.

55:43.007 --> 55:45.668
- So, here is your fortune.
- Oh, thank you.

55:45.743 --> 55:48.638
- You read. Okay?
- Okay.

55:49.213 --> 55:51.140
"Love can be likened to a tree,

55:51.215 --> 55:54.509
"when it is blossoming,
wait for fruit with patience,

55:54.584 --> 55:56.712
"of course the precondition
of our marriage

55:56.787 --> 55:59.682
is that both of you have a disposition
for getting along well.

55:59.757 --> 56:02.815
Thank you for your H.K. 50 dollars."

56:03.827 --> 56:05.922
That's it?

56:06.797 --> 56:09.525
But the birds were cute. Right?

56:09.600 --> 56:12.228
- Sorry. No good?
- It's good.

56:12.303 --> 56:14.297
- Oh, birdy no good?
- No, it's fine.

56:14.372 --> 56:19.268
Okay, never mind. I tell you fortune,
for real. Okay? No charge.

56:19.343 --> 56:23.372
You know what? I'm actually all
fortuned out, but why don't you do him?

56:23.947 --> 56:25.975
- I tell your fortune. Okay?
- Yes. Tell my fortune.

56:26.050 --> 56:28.676
Okay. Good. Come here.

56:28.752 --> 56:31.171
I tell your fortune from your face.

56:31.246 --> 56:34.286
Okay. This side doing it? Okay.

56:36.060 --> 56:39.523
- My God.
- What? Everything okay?

56:41.098 --> 56:43.622
Very big nose.

56:44.801 --> 56:47.563
Is that a fortune,
or is that just like, a statement?

56:47.638 --> 56:51.286
No, no, no. Big nose
means much money. Okay?

56:52.742 --> 56:54.708
- Lots of money.
- Should I be offended by this?

56:54.783 --> 56:57.824
- Not at all. He hasn't gotten to your ears yet.
- It doesn't sound... Okay.

56:57.899 --> 57:00.927
You have to wait until you are 40.

57:01.352 --> 57:03.846
Big nose, much money when you are 40.

57:03.921 --> 57:06.112
- Until I'm 40, all right.
- Right.

57:07.690 --> 57:10.753
- Are you married?
- Me? No, no, no, no.

57:11.228 --> 57:14.191
I think maybe come very close.

57:15.765 --> 57:19.763
- Yes.
- I think maybe you're engaged.

57:20.638 --> 57:22.931
I was.

57:23.606 --> 57:28.501
Too bad. Right? But never mind.
New love coming.

57:29.347 --> 57:31.674
Yes, thank you.
You can tell all this by my nose?

57:31.749 --> 57:35.110
No, no. I can tell it from the young lady.
The way you look at each other.

57:35.185 --> 57:36.946
- You're good.
- Oh, no.

57:37.021 --> 57:39.272
- All right. Well, thank you.
- Good.

57:39.347 --> 57:41.864
- You have a beautiful nose, as well, sir.
- Thank you.

57:42.159 --> 57:45.121
- Much money.
- For the birds. Okay? For the birds.

57:45.196 --> 57:47.539
- Okay. Thank you.
- All right. Thank you.

57:47.614 --> 57:50.993
- All right, I'll be back when I'm 40.
- Thank you. Thank you. Good luck.

57:51.068 --> 57:53.225
And see if you're right.

58:05.515 --> 58:07.193
What?

58:07.268 --> 58:09.311
So you were engaged once.

58:09.386 --> 58:11.481
There it is. Ten minutes.
I knew you were gonna ask me.

58:11.556 --> 58:13.716
What happened? I mean,
we don't have to talk about it.

58:13.791 --> 58:18.087
I don't care. I'll talk about it.
We were young, and stupid.

58:18.162 --> 58:23.092
We met right after graduation,
and we got engaged three weeks later.

58:23.367 --> 58:25.861
Yeah. She was an American lit major.

58:25.936 --> 58:28.731
So... we took a day trip up to Sleepy Hollow

58:28.806 --> 58:32.900
and I got one one knee,
right on Washington Irving's grave.

58:32.975 --> 58:36.505
- That's impulsive and weirdly romantic.
- Yep.

58:36.580 --> 58:40.042
And then she cheated on me with my friend.

58:40.117 --> 58:42.812
- I'm really sorry. That's awful.
- No, it's... actually, it's fine.

58:42.887 --> 58:45.281
It all worked out for the best.

58:45.356 --> 58:49.051
You know, I came here for a job,
I was only supposed to be here for a year.

58:49.126 --> 58:52.520
- Sounds familiar.
- 11 years later.

58:52.595 --> 58:56.141
- Could I end up here for that long?
- Well, you never know.

58:56.216 --> 58:58.543
Yeah, I guess you don't.

58:59.670 --> 59:03.139
- Is he trying to Skype you?
- Sorry. No, no, it's just...

59:03.214 --> 59:05.968
my outlook reminder for a Skype call later.

59:06.043 --> 59:08.671
- Wait, your what?
- I know, I know. It's pretty dorky.

59:08.746 --> 59:13.743
But he likes to send me an outlook
reminder for our Skype dates.

59:13.818 --> 59:17.647
Because it makes him happy
to see it in his calendar, so...

59:18.222 --> 59:20.812
Well, I guess that's pretty sweet.

59:21.290 --> 59:23.652
Yeah. It is really sweet.

59:23.727 --> 59:27.057
So how long have you and Greg been...

59:28.832 --> 59:32.889
- Five years, on and off. Yeah.
- Yeah?

59:32.969 --> 59:36.432
- So, when we met you were...
- Off again. Obviously.

59:36.507 --> 59:39.001
Hey, I don't know.

59:39.176 --> 59:41.812
What's next for you two?

59:43.781 --> 59:45.692
- Sorry.
- Yeah, no worries.

59:45.767 --> 59:48.678
My turn. Hello?

59:48.753 --> 59:50.579
Hey.

59:50.754 --> 59:55.117
Yeah. I'm sorry, I'm gonna be there.
I just got caught up with something. Okay.

59:55.192 --> 59:58.754
Okay. Coming. Sorry. Bye.

59:58.829 --> 01:00:00.518
Sam?

01:00:00.593 --> 01:00:03.308
No. It was my friends, they're musicians,

01:00:03.383 --> 01:00:06.396
they're playing at this little spot
over in Hong Kong.

01:00:07.471 --> 01:00:10.362
- Do you want to come?
- No thanks.

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:14.303
- She's not gonna be there.
- I wasn't thinking that.

01:00:14.378 --> 01:00:17.277
Okay, then forget I said it.

01:00:17.652 --> 01:00:20.876
It would be a good opportunity
for you to meet some new people.

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:24.130
- Come on.
- No, I don't know. I just...

01:00:24.205 --> 01:00:26.882
- It would be weird.
- You're being weird.

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:31.120
It's practically on your way home.
Come on. We'll split a cab.

01:00:31.195 --> 01:00:33.655
- I'm not being weird.
- You're being weird, let's just go.

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:36.124
They're a good band.

01:00:37.199 --> 01:00:40.964
- Fine, only if you can find a cab.
- All right.

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:43.075
This is weird.

01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:45.747
Everyone knows you can't find
a cross-harbor taxi at this time.

01:00:45.943 --> 01:00:49.101
But there's usually
a long line of taxis here.

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:53.038
Here we go.

01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:00.583
- No? Come on.
- See? Told ya. Maybe it's a sign.

01:01:00.658 --> 01:01:03.385
- A sign of what?
- That I should just take the train home.

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:06.656
No. That's not happening.
We're getting a taxi.

01:01:06.731 --> 01:01:11.327
- I'm gonna give you one more shot.
- Okay. I'll take those odds.

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:16.028
Here we go. This is the one.

01:02:24.807 --> 01:02:27.502
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey, man, how are you?

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:29.705
- Hey, Josh.
- This is Ruby.

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:32.105
- Hi.
- How's everything with work?

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:33.776
- Good.
- Tell them I said hello.

01:02:33.851 --> 01:02:36.435
- Will do.
- Thank you.

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.518
- You want a drink?
- Yeah. That would be great.

01:02:42.593 --> 01:02:46.692
- What are you having?
- I'll have a beer. Thank you.

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:05.106
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:07.806
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:32.538
- So I want to...
- So, I...

01:03:32.613 --> 01:03:35.438
- No, you first. You first.
- Your friends are great.

01:03:35.513 --> 01:03:39.775
- Yeah. Yeah, they have a residency here.
- Oh. It's a cool place.

01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:43.378
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah. What were you gonna say?

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:47.606
I wanted to...
I wanted to show you this picture.

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:52.121
- No.
- Ten minutes after we met.

01:03:52.196 --> 01:03:55.616
- And this got me into a lot of trouble.
- Oh, yeah?

01:03:55.691 --> 01:03:57.926
- Yeah.
- What happened?

01:03:58.001 --> 01:04:00.763
I told Sam what happened that night.

01:04:00.838 --> 01:04:04.146
And then she saw this photo
three months later.

01:04:04.221 --> 01:04:06.501
She was like... "Well, you didn't
tell me she was that pretty."

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:09.334
Whatever. She didn't say that.

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.648
Thank you very much.

01:04:19.723 --> 01:04:22.585
I think we have a few more songs.
What do you guys want to hear?

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.887
- "Hearts!"
- "Hearts!"

01:04:24.962 --> 01:04:26.555
Is that their big one?

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:28.987
- The big one.
- Yeah?

01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:44.406
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:48.407
- Oh, no, no, no, no, please.
- Come on, come on. Come on.

01:06:11.868 --> 01:06:13.759
Josh?

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:16.999
- How's it going?
- Hey, Monica. Good.

01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:19.268
This is my friend, Ruby.

01:06:19.343 --> 01:06:22.004
- Hey.
- Hi, I'm Monica, Sam's friend.

01:06:22.079 --> 01:06:23.605
His girlfriend.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:27.109
- She knows Sam. Yeah.
- What are you doing here?

01:06:27.184 --> 01:06:30.969
We just came here to see
Knots and Axes with the guys.

01:06:31.044 --> 01:06:34.115
- Well, it was really good seeing you.
- Yeah, you too.

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:38.676
- Tell Sam I said hi.
- I will. Good to see you. Bye.

01:06:42.564 --> 01:06:44.623
Excuse me.

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:48.697
Wait.

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:51.500
- Hey, Josh, we're taking off.
- You guys are taking off?

01:06:51.575 --> 01:06:53.335
- Yeah.
- Why don't you come over sometime?

01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:56.831
- Yeah. I will, I will, I promise.
- And check out the new...

01:07:14.396 --> 01:07:16.555
You okay?

01:07:17.232 --> 01:07:19.461
Yeah, I just needed some air.

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.397
Yeah.

01:07:21.972 --> 01:07:24.229
Sorry about that.

01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:28.033
It was pretty awful.

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:31.871
Can I get one of these?

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:37.376
Yeah.

01:07:51.984 --> 01:07:54.308
What are we doing?

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:59.709
Smoking a cigarette.

01:08:02.402 --> 01:08:05.949
I don't know. What do you mean?

01:08:07.916 --> 01:08:10.512
I mean this whole night.

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:12.113
- Look...
- What are we doing?

01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:14.783
I know where you're going
with this, but...

01:08:14.858 --> 01:08:18.649
Really, we were just hanging out.

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:21.319
Right?

01:08:30.005 --> 01:08:32.223
I don't know.

01:08:42.484 --> 01:08:44.895
I need to get going.

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:51.683
- Should we split a cab?
- Yeah, that's fine.

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:49.377
- Which address?
- Ridgeview Terrace.

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:52.042
On Square street, thanks.

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:25.043
Does she appreciate your stupid quotes?

01:10:26.488 --> 01:10:30.349
Does he appreciate
your sassy attitude all the time?

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:35.620
- It goes right over his head.
- That's good, I guess.

01:10:38.801 --> 01:10:41.359
It's not fair for them.

01:10:45.207 --> 01:10:47.732
We haven't done anything.

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:52.207
- I don't want to be a cheater.
- Neither do I.

01:10:52.282 --> 01:10:54.743
But... we're not.

01:10:54.818 --> 01:10:57.078
I'm talking about emotionally
cheating, not just...

01:10:57.153 --> 01:10:59.205
All right.

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:04.185
It's hard to define.

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:06.688
You know when you feel it.

01:11:07.063 --> 01:11:10.292
Look, I don't think we should
beat ourselves up over this.

01:11:10.367 --> 01:11:13.563
Maybe just by virtue of the fact
that we can have a night like this.

01:11:13.638 --> 01:11:17.031
- Two.
- Exactly. Two nights like this.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:20.042
Maybe that means that we should...

01:11:20.744 --> 01:11:24.306
take a good look at our relationships
and, I don't know...

01:11:25.181 --> 01:11:27.372
re-evaluate.

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:38.353
- He's coming this weekend.
- Who, Greg?

01:11:38.428 --> 01:11:41.723
- Daniel, his name is Daniel.
- Daniel.

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:44.526
I was way off.

01:11:44.601 --> 01:11:47.292
And he's helping me pack up.

01:11:48.104 --> 01:11:52.701
My year is up next week.
And the suit was...

01:11:53.176 --> 01:11:56.264
for our engagement party.

01:11:59.213 --> 01:12:01.506
You're engaged?

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:04.776
Yeah.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.983
I'm sorry. I know, I should have
told you sooner, I just...

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:13.685
It's just such a new thing for me.
I'm not really used to the idea yet.

01:12:15.264 --> 01:12:16.625
You're not wearing a ring.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.676
We're picking out one together
when he gets here. It's just...

01:12:19.751 --> 01:12:23.428
- more cost-efficient that way.
- Good, old, sensible Greg.

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:28.303
- Did he propose over Skype, too?
- No.

01:12:28.378 --> 01:12:32.137
We discussed it together
as a decision we made.

01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:36.211
Very, very romantic.

01:12:36.386 --> 01:12:39.477
Not everyone can be as impulsive as you.

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:47.119
I'm happy for you, Ruby.

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:50.555
I am.

01:12:55.938 --> 01:12:58.783
Except now, I just...

01:12:58.975 --> 01:13:01.403
I don't know what I want.

01:13:02.178 --> 01:13:04.569
I don't know what I want.

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:22.610
- Okay, total...
- Just... one second.

01:13:22.685 --> 01:13:24.773
Right here. Meter running.

01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:27.662
Just keep it running, it's okay.

01:13:27.737 --> 01:13:30.267
What are you saying, Ruby?

01:13:31.107 --> 01:13:33.631
I don't know. I just...

01:13:34.242 --> 01:13:36.968
This night just threw me for such a loop.

01:13:38.379 --> 01:13:40.471
Me too.

01:13:40.682 --> 01:13:43.107
I don't want to hurt him.

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:47.179
I don't want to hurt her.
