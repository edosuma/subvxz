NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:09.756 --> 00:13.670
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:13.727 --> 00:15.536
the police who
investigate crime

00:15.595 --> 00:18.405
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:18.465 --> 00:20.138
These are their stories.

00:21.468 --> 00:24.278
Officer, please, please,
my Bruno ran down there.

00:24.338 --> 00:26.784
Don't worry, ma'am.
We'll take care of it.

00:26.840 --> 00:29.616
This should put us on the
fast track for promotion.

00:29.676 --> 00:31.417
Yeah. Tell me about it.

00:31.478 --> 00:33.480
Take a look over there.
I'll look down here.

00:33.547 --> 00:35.049
Yeah. Right.

(DOG YELPING)

00:36.450 --> 00:38.123
I think I see him.

00:38.185 --> 00:43.692
Here, Bruno, nice doggy.
Your mommy's looking for you.

00:43.757 --> 00:45.828
Scroungy little rat.

00:46.993 --> 00:49.166
Oh, man!

00:49.229 --> 00:52.870
Why do these things always
happen at the end of a shift.

00:53.633 --> 00:54.976
BRISCOE: Look at his
tan lines.

00:55.035 --> 00:56.844
He's missing a ring
and a watch.

00:56.903 --> 00:58.780
CURTIS: Got a wallet?
BRISCOE: No.

00:58.839 --> 01:00.409
CURTIS: What do
you think? 9mm?

01:00.474 --> 01:01.612
BRISCOE: Maybe.

01:01.675 --> 01:02.983
Victim number five, huh?

01:03.043 --> 01:04.113
Maybe.

01:04.177 --> 01:06.589
You think it's that mugger
who kills his victims?

01:06.646 --> 01:08.455
I don't think.

01:09.282 --> 01:11.319
No exit wound.

Blood type B negative."

Catholic.

01:23.497 --> 01:25.340
Funny place for
a mugging.

01:25.465 --> 01:28.275
CSU says that they saw
blood up on the roadway.

01:28.335 --> 01:30.144
Probably rolled down.

01:30.203 --> 01:31.546
So what happened
to the dog?

01:31.605 --> 01:33.243
He's with my partner.

01:33.306 --> 01:34.410
Where's your partner?

01:34.474 --> 01:35.885
Lincoln Hospital.

01:35.942 --> 01:38.286
The paramedics couldn't pry
the dog from his butt.

01:38.345 --> 01:39.449
What kind of dog?

01:39.513 --> 01:40.924
Chihuahua.

01:40.981 --> 01:44.190

02:33.935 --> 02:35.141
No.

02:35.203 --> 02:36.580
We got a time
of death yet?

02:36.637 --> 02:38.344
The same day
he left the ship.

02:38.406 --> 02:42.513
The 4th, between
9:30 and 11:00 p.m.

02:42.577 --> 02:44.523
Five victims in six weeks.

02:44.645 --> 02:46.591
You get a description
of the missing property?

02:46.647 --> 02:48.888
Yeah. Black leather wallet,
monogrammed,

02:48.950 --> 02:50.793
a Russian watch
he acquired in the Gulf

02:50.852 --> 02:52.661
and a gold wedding ring,
engraved.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.461
We'll add the stuff to
the pawnshop bulletins.

02:56.624 --> 02:59.230
Or we can get on the phones.

03:01.496 --> 03:03.100
Hey, it's not
rocket science.

03:03.164 --> 03:05.644
You check the bulletin, then
you check your inventory.

03:05.700 --> 03:07.202
If anything matches,
you call us.

03:07.268 --> 03:08.508
CURTIS: it's a Russian watch.

03:08.603 --> 03:11.607
Soviet? Yeah, I'll hold.

03:12.073 --> 03:14.576
Hi. This is Detective
Briscoe, the 27th Precinct.

03:14.642 --> 03:17.486
We need to add a few items to
your stolen property bulletin.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

03:23.651 --> 03:24.652
Who you got?

03:24.719 --> 03:26.027

03:30.525 --> 03:33.165

03:34.095 --> 03:36.905
Yeah, I know, I know.
You never fenced anything in your life.

03:36.964 --> 03:39.137
Do me a favor
and look again.

03:39.734 --> 03:43.341
No, you won't get back to me, you'll
do it now or I'm coming over there.

03:44.172 --> 03:45.981
How many hock shops
in the five boroughs?

03:46.040 --> 03:52.423
I've got Mets tickets next month.
Yeah? Yeah, what kind of an item?

03:52.480 --> 03:56.895
Gold starburst with sapphire
and tourmalines?

03:57.418 --> 03:59.193
Don't move.
We'll be right over.

03:59.253 --> 04:01.631
And don't lose it,
and don't sell it.

04:01.856 --> 04:04.860
We've got a hit.
Brooch from the third victim.

04:11.833 --> 04:15.406
Hey, I read the papers.
I hear this guy whacks people.

04:15.470 --> 04:17.541
Which one?
What?

04:17.605 --> 04:22.053
I'm watching you, Louis.
I saw that look. Which one?

04:22.110 --> 04:23.384
I want protection.

04:24.412 --> 04:28.053
You got 14 cousins that look like a
moose herd when they get together.

04:28.116 --> 04:31.620
I think they can babysit you for a
few hours while we bag the guy.

04:31.686 --> 04:33.029
Which one?

04:33.087 --> 04:34.828
How about after
you bag the guy?

04:34.889 --> 04:35.890
Five counts.

04:35.957 --> 04:40.463
Murder one with special circumstances.
He ain't gonna make bail.

04:41.529 --> 04:42.974
Which one?

04:43.764 --> 04:45.072
Which one?

Lenny Travers.
Paroled from Attica eight weeks ago.

04:50.538 --> 04:52.279
Armed robbery.

04:52.340 --> 04:55.287
Guess they didn't explain the
terms of his parole real well.

04:55.343 --> 04:58.347
Well, check with his PO to make
sure that's his current address

04:58.412 --> 04:59.789
and move on him.

05:46.928 --> 05:48.930

of real heroes.

You hid behind ESU till the guy was dead.
(MEN CHUCKLING)

05:51.732 --> 05:54.406
Well, next time we'll let you
take the point, Anderson.

05:54.468 --> 05:57.415
With that gut, you could stop a
whole clip and still keep charging.

05:57.672 --> 05:59.709
We cleared five murders.
What'd you do today?

05:59.774 --> 06:00.809
VAN BUREN: Four.

06:02.109 --> 06:03.986
At least try to
look busy.

06:05.046 --> 06:07.686
The Navy guy wasn't
shot with Travers' gun.

06:08.349 --> 06:09.953
Maybe Travers
had two guns.

06:10.017 --> 06:11.257
Well, let's go on
the assumption

06:11.319 --> 06:13.230
that somebody else
killed Chief Stroud.

06:13.287 --> 06:15.289
Here's the autopsy and
the ballistics report.

for one cracked rib, recent.

Yeah. And one bullet
to the brain. More recent.

I'm Detective Curtis,
this is Detective Briscoe.

06:34.575 --> 06:38.523
Your captain said we should talk
to you about Stroud, Robert, J.

06:38.579 --> 06:39.580
You find the killer yet?

06:39.647 --> 06:40.648
BRISCOE: No. Not yet.

06:40.715 --> 06:42.217
But we're looking.

06:42.283 --> 06:44.126
When was he on
the ship last?

06:44.719 --> 06:48.599
He had liberty on the 4th, and he
wasn't back for quarters at 0700.

06:48.656 --> 06:50.192
CURTIS: What did you do?

06:50.258 --> 06:53.205
We placed him on
unauthorized absence.

06:53.261 --> 06:54.262
What was his rank?

06:54.328 --> 06:56.569
He was a chief
aviation mechanics mate,

06:56.631 --> 06:59.874
in charge of one of the crews that
refuels, maintains our aircraft.

06:59.934 --> 07:02.414
Did he say anything about
his plans for liberty?

07:02.470 --> 07:03.949
Museums? Walking tours?

07:04.105 --> 07:05.311
Hookers?

07:05.373 --> 07:06.545
He was married.

07:06.607 --> 07:09.451
Well, so? He's here in the Big
Apple, she's not, you know...

07:09.510 --> 07:10.955
BILLINGS: But she was.

07:11.279 --> 07:13.691
She serves on
the supply ship Lambert,

07:13.748 --> 07:15.625
which moored the
same day that we did.

07:15.683 --> 07:17.594
She's a quartermaster.

07:17.685 --> 07:19.926
I didn't see my husband
on the 4th.

07:19.987 --> 07:24.163
You're in the same port at the same
time, you don't see each other?

07:24.759 --> 07:27.262
What is this about?
I thought Bobby was shot by a mugger.

07:28.396 --> 07:30.467
You know anybody who
would've wanted him dead?

07:30.531 --> 07:31.908
You didn't answer
my question.

07:31.966 --> 07:35.470
The mugger didn't do it,
so somebody else did.

07:35.536 --> 07:36.708
Did Bobby have
any enemies?

07:37.672 --> 07:39.310
Not that I know of.

07:39.373 --> 07:42.786
But we were usually separated
by a continent or two.

07:44.445 --> 07:47.085
Were you separated
by anything else?

07:47.148 --> 07:49.128
Or somebody else?

07:50.885 --> 07:53.024
What does that mean?
You don't know or you're not gonna say?

07:54.221 --> 07:55.495
I'm the wrong
person to ask.

07:56.223 --> 07:57.793
Well, who's the right
person to ask?

07:57.858 --> 08:01.499
You should ask somebody who spent
more time with him than I did.

08:01.562 --> 08:04.042
If you'll excuse me, I have
to change for the watch.

08:06.100 --> 08:09.411
She have anybody in particular
to be jealous about?

08:09.470 --> 08:12.883
There are 3,652 sailors
on this ship.

08:12.940 --> 08:14.920
I don't monitor
their personal lives

08:14.975 --> 08:17.046
unless they have problems
with Navy regs.

08:17.111 --> 08:18.784
CURTIS: Anybody bring Stroud
to your attention?

08:19.113 --> 08:22.788
Yes. He was decorated
during the Gulf War.

08:23.351 --> 08:25.991
Pulled a pilot from
a burning plane on deck.

08:26.053 --> 08:27.896
BRISCOE: You got any
women on board?

08:28.356 --> 08:29.733
Sixty-four women.

08:29.957 --> 08:31.436
Stroud hound dog
any of them?

08:32.058 --> 08:33.970
Stroud's wife seems to think
he was fooling around,

08:34.028 --> 08:35.974
so we just need to
follow up, you know.

08:36.030 --> 08:38.340
BRISCOE: Could we talk to
his immediate superior?

08:39.500 --> 08:42.344
That would be his pilot,
Lieutenant Blair.

08:43.770 --> 08:45.910
He was the best crew chief
I've ever worked with.

08:45.973 --> 08:48.817
There was nothing he didn't
know about the F-14.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.822
He sleeping with
anybody on the ship?

08:50.878 --> 08:52.516
Not that I know of.

08:53.247 --> 08:56.456
You ever meet
Stroud's wife?

08:56.517 --> 08:58.155
Is that the direction
this is pointing?

08:58.219 --> 09:02.065
Well, the dial's still spinning.
Did you ever meet her?

09:02.156 --> 09:03.328
Briefly.

09:03.391 --> 09:05.234
She seem like
the jealous type?

09:06.026 --> 09:08.506
I don't know her well enough
to have an opinion.

09:09.397 --> 09:11.377
Did Stroud ever
come on to you?

09:11.632 --> 09:15.307
I work hard to keep my professional
relationships professional.

09:15.469 --> 09:17.073
Well, he must've
found you attractive.

09:17.138 --> 09:18.640
It's a non-issue.

09:18.706 --> 09:20.913
The Navy says I can't
fraternize, so I don't.

09:21.008 --> 09:22.544
But you would
if you could?

09:23.577 --> 09:24.647
No.

09:24.712 --> 09:26.589
You didn't find
him attractive?

09:26.981 --> 09:28.619
I don't sleep
with married men.

09:29.517 --> 09:33.624
The Navy has a rule about
that, too, and so do I.

09:34.255 --> 09:36.963
If there's anything specific I
can do, please let me know.

09:37.024 --> 09:38.867
Stroud was a fine sailor.

09:38.926 --> 09:41.998
Everyone on the ship
wants to see justice done.

09:43.597 --> 09:45.907
No, I don't know
who these kids are.

09:45.966 --> 09:48.879
No, I don't want you to give
him a lecture and let him go.

09:48.936 --> 09:52.247
Put him in a holding cell
and call his father.

09:53.073 --> 09:54.245
Problem?

09:54.375 --> 09:55.581
My son.

09:55.643 --> 09:58.214
Manhattan South caught him
tagging a truck.

10:04.919 --> 10:08.298
Arrest report.

10:08.889 --> 10:10.800
Assault, 11-10-96.

10:10.858 --> 10:14.328
Bar brawl. Hampton, Virginia.
it's where the broken rib came from.

10:14.395 --> 10:15.465
The charges were dropped.

10:15.529 --> 10:17.509
Turned out Stroud
wasn't the attacker.

10:17.565 --> 10:19.442
Who was?
VAN BUREN: His wife.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.411
Witnesses said that
she started the beef,

10:21.469 --> 10:23.710
then he shoved her,
she threw a punch.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.951
He had 60 pounds on her.
How'd he get a busted rib?

10:26.207 --> 10:30.178
She flipped him over the bar.
Where's her arrest report?

10:30.244 --> 10:31.848
He refused to
press charges.

10:32.379 --> 10:34.916
Bet he'd like to
change his mind now.

10:40.521 --> 10:42.865
I had the watch that night.
I never left the ship.

10:42.923 --> 10:44.766
Can anybody
confirm that?

10:44.825 --> 10:48.898
Lieutenant Slade, Ensign Blackledge,
Machinist's Mate Wilson.

10:48.963 --> 10:51.910
You busted your husband's
ribs a couple of months back.

10:51.966 --> 10:53.570
One rib.

10:54.802 --> 10:56.611
I caught him
with another woman.

10:56.670 --> 10:57.978
Caught him, how?

10:58.038 --> 11:00.609
I knew he was fooling around
again, so I followed him.

11:00.674 --> 11:01.846
She met him at a bar.

11:01.976 --> 11:02.977
What'd they do?

11:03.043 --> 11:04.522
They were all
over each other,

11:04.578 --> 11:07.491
and she knew he was married.
She should've left him alone.

11:07.548 --> 11:10.859
How am I supposed to compete with
the poster girl for the new Navy?

11:10.918 --> 11:12.864
Who're we
talking about?

11:12.920 --> 11:15.799
His pilot. Lieutenant
high-and-mighty Blair.

11:18.192 --> 11:20.672
I wrote a letter of complaint to
the Bureau of Naval Personnel.

11:20.728 --> 11:22.173
They said they'd
investigate.

11:22.229 --> 11:24.106
All they did was
sweep it under the rug.

11:24.164 --> 11:25.234
Why would they do that?

11:25.833 --> 11:29.440
Please. They spent
$5,000,000 training her.

11:29.503 --> 11:33.041
And she's who they point to when anybody
starts screaming about discrimination.

11:33.107 --> 11:34.245
We're gonna need
to run ballistics

11:34.308 --> 11:36.845
on whatever 9mm guns you
have access to, all right?

11:38.913 --> 11:42.861
You're sure we're talking about the 4th?
That was a Thursday.

11:42.917 --> 11:44.954
Okay, thanks.

11:45.019 --> 11:46.589
She never left
the ship on the 4th.

11:46.654 --> 11:51.467
And if she killed him, she didn't
use any 9mm in the ship's locker.

11:51.525 --> 11:53.732
(IN SINGSONG VOICE)
Round and round we go.

11:54.361 --> 11:56.898
The investigation was assigned
to Commander Halibert,

11:56.964 --> 11:58.272
executive officer of the ship.

11:58.332 --> 12:02.371
Now according to his report, both
Stroud and Blair denied the allegation.

12:02.469 --> 12:04.005
And he just took
their word for it?

12:04.071 --> 12:05.311
No.

12:06.106 --> 12:07.779
Blair said she was
involved with a civilian,

12:07.841 --> 12:09.479
Halibert talked to him,
and it checked out.

12:09.710 --> 12:12.418
How come you didn't tell us all this
stuff the last time we were here?

12:13.247 --> 12:15.488
Look, I don't know where you people
think you're going with this,

12:15.549 --> 12:17.256
but let me tell
you something.

12:17.318 --> 12:20.959
Lieutenant Blair was one of the
first women in US Navy history

12:21.021 --> 12:23.934
to qualify for
night carrier landings.

12:23.991 --> 12:27.598
You think she's gonna screw that
up for some glorified deckhand?

12:27.661 --> 12:29.436
Who's the civilian
she was seeing?

12:29.496 --> 12:31.703
An engineer at GE.

12:32.066 --> 12:33.272
Yeah, I dated her.

12:33.334 --> 12:35.507
What kind of relationship
did you have?

12:35.569 --> 12:38.106
A dating relationship.

12:38.172 --> 12:39.981
Was it serious?

12:40.174 --> 12:43.417
I thought so,
and then she broke it off.

12:43.577 --> 12:45.113
You don't seem too
torn up about it.

12:46.347 --> 12:48.623
I'm failing to see
what makes it your business.

12:48.682 --> 12:50.218
Well, this is
the easy way.

12:50.284 --> 12:51.524
If you'd like to
come downtown...

12:51.585 --> 12:52.962
(SIGHS)

12:53.220 --> 12:54.790
What is she,
some kind of spy?

12:56.123 --> 12:57.466
The Navy was on
my back for weeks,

12:57.524 --> 12:58.901
and now you guys.

13:00.894 --> 13:02.931
Okay, and I'm not
doing this again.

13:03.864 --> 13:09.177
I dated her for six months.
When she was in New York, we went out.

13:09.236 --> 13:10.943
She broke up
with me last fall.

13:11.005 --> 13:13.417
You told the Navy it was
still going hot and heavy.

13:14.541 --> 13:15.713
She asked me to.

13:15.776 --> 13:16.777
She asked you to lie?

13:18.278 --> 13:20.554
Maybe stretch it
a little.

13:20.614 --> 13:22.491
So why'd she
break it off?

13:22.549 --> 13:24.358
She said she met
the man of her dreams.

13:25.152 --> 13:26.859
She put it that way?
The "man of her dreams"?

13:27.421 --> 13:28.559
She happen to
give you a name?

13:29.089 --> 13:31.262
No. She said it was
somebody on her ship.

13:31.325 --> 13:33.327
I assumed it was
another pilot.

13:34.228 --> 13:35.639
BLAIR: I lied to him.

13:36.196 --> 13:39.006
I didn't want to see him anymore.
He wouldn't leave me alone.

13:39.066 --> 13:41.205
Sol made up a story.

13:41.702 --> 13:43.443
I wasn't seeing
anybody else.

13:43.671 --> 13:45.344
Including Stroud?

13:45.406 --> 13:46.851
Including Stroud.

13:46.907 --> 13:48.580
What'd you do on the 4th?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

13:50.110 --> 13:51.919
This is Lieutenant
Commander Mclntyre

13:51.979 --> 13:54.459
from the Judge
Advocate General's office.

13:54.515 --> 13:56.222
You don't have to
answer their questions.

13:56.283 --> 13:58.058
I want to.

13:58.952 --> 14:02.024
I had liberty on the
4th, starting at 1300.

14:02.089 --> 14:04.660
I spent the afternoon
at the Cloisters.

14:04.725 --> 14:07.399
I ate dinner in a cafe
on Bleecker Street.

14:07.461 --> 14:11.307
No, I don't remember the name
of it, and I went to a movie.

14:11.365 --> 14:12.503
CURTIS: What movie?

14:12.566 --> 14:13.874
The Lost World.

14:13.934 --> 14:15.936
At a multiplex
in Times Square.

14:16.003 --> 14:17.209
What time?

14:17.271 --> 14:18.443
2100.

14:18.505 --> 14:21.111
Opposite ends of Manhattan,
that's a lot of traveling.

14:21.175 --> 14:22.449
You get any
taxi receipts?

14:22.509 --> 14:23.920
BLAIR: I used my car.

14:23.977 --> 14:25.217
You keep a car
in the city?

14:25.379 --> 14:27.154
At my parents' house.
In Connecticut.

14:27.214 --> 14:28.386
Where is it now?

14:28.449 --> 14:31.555
At a parking garage
on West 38th. Webber's.

14:31.618 --> 14:32.653
CURTIS: You mind if
we examine it?

14:32.720 --> 14:33.994
MCINTYRE: Not without
a warrant.

14:34.054 --> 14:36.227
I think Lieutenant Blair
has cooperated enough.

14:36.290 --> 14:38.998
You want to talk to her
again, go through me.

14:41.462 --> 14:43.066
Looks like the grieving
widow was right

14:43.130 --> 14:45.167
about the Navy protecting
their poster girl.

14:45.232 --> 14:47.075
And about the affair.

14:49.036 --> 14:50.743
You know,
we don't need a warrant

14:50.804 --> 14:53.114
to look at the outside
of the car.

14:54.675 --> 15:01.149
This is it here. She took it out last Thursday.
Yeah, here it is, the 4th.

15:01.215 --> 15:02.990
1:36 p.m.

15:03.050 --> 15:04.552
You remember her?

15:04.618 --> 15:06.120
She's what I dream about.
(CHUCKLES)

15:07.121 --> 15:08.725
When did she
bring it back?

15:09.089 --> 15:10.659
Not while I was here.

15:10.724 --> 15:12.465
This is one clean car.

15:12.526 --> 15:14.472
MAN: It was a little dusty
when she took it out.

15:15.229 --> 15:19.473
Here it is.
11:48, same day, p.m.

15:19.533 --> 15:24.107
Hey, Lennie, the tint on this window
is different than the others.

15:24.171 --> 15:25.548
New window?

15:29.009 --> 15:31.819
CURTIS: "Heinrich Muller
Exotic Cars."

15:31.912 --> 15:36.861
Müller. There's an umlaut.
Heinrich's kind of a stickler for the umlaut.

15:36.917 --> 15:40.763
She told me somebody smashed the
window when it was parked someplace.

15:41.121 --> 15:42.395
She didn't get
any more specific?

15:43.090 --> 15:45.092
You want the truth,
I stopped listening,

15:45.159 --> 15:46.934
I was picturing how
she'd look in leather.

15:47.661 --> 15:48.969
You come to
any conclusions?

15:50.030 --> 15:52.340
There's Jerry.
He worked on the car.

15:52.399 --> 15:54.572
What'd you do with
the broken glass?

15:56.804 --> 15:58.283
I didn't find any
pieces in the track,

15:58.338 --> 15:59.578
but some had fallen
in the panel.

15:59.640 --> 16:00.710
They always do.

16:00.774 --> 16:02.117
How do you know
those are from her car?

16:02.176 --> 16:03.621
Custom tint job.

16:03.677 --> 16:04.985
Now, there was one,
a corner piece,

16:05.045 --> 16:07.855
with the DOT number,
there it is.

16:08.515 --> 16:09.858
No blood?

16:10.150 --> 16:11.493
You sound disappointed.

16:12.319 --> 16:13.992
The bullet that
shattered her window

16:14.054 --> 16:16.227
was fired from
inside the car.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.394
Forensics found powder
residue on the glass.

16:18.458 --> 16:20.096
How do we know
it was her car?

16:20.160 --> 16:22.572
'Cause the mechanic says so.
'Cause the lab says so.

16:22.629 --> 16:23.972
The DOT number matches.

16:24.031 --> 16:25.908
What does she say about it?
Nothing.

16:25.966 --> 16:27.741
JAG won't let us
near her.

16:27.801 --> 16:29.178
Did you check
her alibi yet?

16:29.236 --> 16:30.874
CURTIS: Nobody saw her
at the Cloisters.

16:30.938 --> 16:33.509
We canvassed every eating
place on Bleecker, no result.

16:33.574 --> 16:35.850
None of the employees at the
movie house ever saw her before.

16:35.909 --> 16:38.355
Yeah. And this is a woman
people tend to remember.

16:38.445 --> 16:40.823
CURTIS: She's in the Navy.
Here today, gone tomorrow.

16:40.881 --> 16:43.384
If we don't move
on her now...

16:43.450 --> 16:46.124
Talk to the D.A.
about a warrant.

16:49.890 --> 16:52.803
JACK: I'm not looking for a
debate, Commander Mclntyre.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.306
The court has issued
an arrest warrant,

16:55.362 --> 16:57.273
and I'm giving you
the option of arranging

16:57.331 --> 16:59.504
a time and place
for her to surrender.

17:01.268 --> 17:03.680
Thank you for
your cooperation.

17:04.570 --> 17:07.050
You can pick her up
2:30 p.m. Pier 88.

17:07.941 --> 17:10.046
I've got 2:40.
What've you got?

17:10.109 --> 17:12.089
I got bandits
at two o'clock.

17:13.579 --> 17:15.719
Where's Lieutenant Blair?

17:16.550 --> 17:18.086
I've been instructed
to tell you the Navy

17:18.151 --> 17:20.061
is asserting jurisdiction
in this case.

17:20.119 --> 17:21.121
We have a warrant.

17:21.555 --> 17:24.729
We have Lieutenant Blair.
And we're keeping her.

17:27.663 --> 17:30.576
I've got two Navy
lawyers in my office.

17:30.633 --> 17:34.103
They want all the police and lab
reports for their investigation.

17:34.170 --> 17:36.446
We're not thinking of ceding
jurisdiction, are we?

17:36.506 --> 17:40.147
We're not ceding anything until
we know what We're dealing with.

17:40.209 --> 17:41.779
Book some time
with the grand jury.

17:41.844 --> 17:43.881
Get an indictment.
Murder two.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.426
Cover the bases.

17:47.316 --> 17:51.059
We realize your office has concurrent
jurisdiction with the Navy.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.293
We don't want to get
into a shooting war.

17:53.356 --> 17:55.097
Neither do I.

17:55.691 --> 17:58.729
How do you intend to proceed
against Lieutenant Blair?

17:58.795 --> 18:01.639
Based on her statement, we believe
the shooting was accidental.

18:02.031 --> 18:03.874
She's admitted
shooting Stroud?

18:03.966 --> 18:06.173
She explained the events
to our satisfaction.

18:06.436 --> 18:08.507
Then you won't mind
if she explains them to us.

18:08.571 --> 18:10.073
It will be off the record.

18:10.139 --> 18:11.277
JACK: Absolutely not.

18:11.407 --> 18:12.715
She makes it,
she lives with it.

18:12.775 --> 18:14.812
So you want
a shooting war, after all.

18:14.877 --> 18:16.857
ADAM: We're all
in the same boat.

18:17.313 --> 18:19.224
We don't want to
look too accommodating,

18:19.282 --> 18:21.888
you don't want to
look too secretive.

18:26.656 --> 18:30.468
Lieutenant Blair will repeat the sworn
statement she made to the Navy.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.904
She will answer
no questions.

18:34.430 --> 18:37.707
Stroud told me he and his wife
were going to get a divorce.

18:37.767 --> 18:41.214
The relationship was still
wrong under Navy regulations,

18:41.270 --> 18:43.409
so I won't try to excuse it.

18:44.340 --> 18:47.719
When I found out his wife was
still in the picture, I ended it.

18:47.777 --> 18:50.917
I didn't want to wreck a
marriage or my career.

18:51.447 --> 18:54.223
But he wouldn't
stop seeing me.

18:55.451 --> 18:57.055
I agreed to meet him
one last time.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.760
We had dinner in
Manhattan. Marlowe's.

19:00.156 --> 19:02.796
I told him I wasn't
willing to risk my career

19:02.859 --> 19:04.668
to be with someone
who'd lie to me.

19:05.061 --> 19:08.167
I drove him back to drop
him off near the ship.

19:08.231 --> 19:09.403
He wouldn't get
out of the car.

19:09.465 --> 19:16.110
He said he wanted to keep on, I won't
use the word he used, seeing me.

19:16.939 --> 19:18.714
Said he liked sleeping
with a pilot.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.786
I tried to reason with him.

19:21.844 --> 19:25.485
He drew a gun and
ordered me to drive on.

19:25.548 --> 19:28.688
We stopped on the road above
where you found the body.

19:28.751 --> 19:33.200
He said if I refused to have sex
with him right then and there,

19:33.256 --> 19:35.532
he'd tell the CO
we'd lied about the affair.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.195
I said go ahead.

19:37.260 --> 19:40.867
He opened his door
and ordered me to get out.

19:42.165 --> 19:43.803
I grabbed the gun.

19:50.406 --> 19:54.354
Being forced to have sex is an
experience I don't need to have.

19:54.410 --> 19:57.516
We struggled,
the gun went off,

19:57.580 --> 20:01.392
the bullet zinged by my head
and shattered my window.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.454
We kept struggling.
The second shot killed him.

20:06.856 --> 20:09.735
I've never seen someone die
right in front of me.

20:10.593 --> 20:14.973
His eyes went dead.
There was an awareness, then nothing.

20:16.999 --> 20:19.411
He dropped the gun,
fell out of the car

20:19.468 --> 20:22.312
and rolled down
the embankment.

20:23.873 --> 20:25.113
And you just
left him there?

20:25.174 --> 20:26.209
No questions.

20:27.343 --> 20:29.380
We need to clarify
some points.

20:29.445 --> 20:30.685
Talk to me.

20:30.846 --> 20:32.086
(SIGHS)

20:32.148 --> 20:34.355
So she climbed
down the embankment

20:34.417 --> 20:36.590
and took his wallet
and his valuables?

20:36.652 --> 20:39.690
The body was lying in the
bushes for quite some time.

20:39.755 --> 20:41.826
Some bum must've
picked him clean.

20:42.124 --> 20:43.125
Where's the weapon?

20:43.192 --> 20:44.262
She threw it off the pier.

20:44.327 --> 20:45.533
LOPEZ: Our divers
recovered it yesterday.

20:45.595 --> 20:48.838
We confirmed it was Stroud's.
He bought it legally in Florida.

20:51.300 --> 20:52.973
JACK: We're not done.
We are.

20:53.035 --> 20:54.912
Lieutenant Blair
came here voluntarily.

20:54.971 --> 20:56.780
One step ahead of
an arrest warrant.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.183
Thank you for coming,
Lieutenant.

21:01.811 --> 21:04.189
In a struggle with
a guy who's 6'1",

21:04.247 --> 21:06.249
she's the one who's left
behind to tell the story?

21:06.315 --> 21:10.457
Lieutenant Blair committed serious
infractions of military regulations.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.294
She will be disciplined
accordingly.

21:12.355 --> 21:14.562
"Accordingly"?
When our investigation is complete,

21:14.624 --> 21:17.036
we'll know better
where we stand.

21:21.063 --> 21:22.906
Have the police
trace her steps.

21:25.401 --> 21:26.937
Oh, yes, I remember them.

21:27.003 --> 21:28.914
I wanted to go, "Ditch the date,
honey, and come with me."

21:29.705 --> 21:31.184
Yeah, she is
a head-turner.

21:32.241 --> 21:33.618
Not her. Him.

21:33.676 --> 21:35.417
You got his phone number
in your little book?

21:36.779 --> 21:38.087
They don't have
phones where he is.

21:38.147 --> 21:39.990
Did you happen to overhear
any of their conversation?

21:40.049 --> 21:42.461
Mmm. Not really.
My impression was that

21:42.518 --> 21:45.931
she was upset,
he was very masterful.

21:45.988 --> 21:47.331
Dominating.

21:48.491 --> 21:49.731
What time did
they leave?

21:49.792 --> 21:51.703
About 9:30, 9:45.

21:51.761 --> 21:55.072
I offered to hail him a cab, but he
said he had a car across the street.

21:55.131 --> 21:57.168
Do they have phones
where you live?

21:59.168 --> 22:01.512
Yeah, if you want
to talk to my wife.

22:03.639 --> 22:06.745
Hey, he's a fun guy.
You could do worse.

22:08.344 --> 22:11.621
People in uniform all
look the same to me.

22:11.681 --> 22:14.457
This guy was wearing chinos
and a polo shirt, blue,

22:14.517 --> 22:16.292
maybe a tan windbreaker.

22:16.786 --> 22:18.493
You know how many people
I see every day?

22:18.554 --> 22:21.899
This would be between
9:30 and 10:00 on the 4th.

22:21.957 --> 22:23.493
How many people
you see then?

22:23.559 --> 22:28.269
Okay, hang on, that was
last Thursday, right?

22:28.331 --> 22:31.869
I got off at 10:00 'cause I had
to go to the Port Authority,

22:31.934 --> 22:34.380
and the last people
I saw were three drunks

22:34.437 --> 22:36.417
that come from somewhere
they don't speak English

22:36.572 --> 22:37.983
and don't know
what a tip is.

22:38.040 --> 22:39.144
Oh, yeah, I remember them.

22:39.208 --> 22:40.915
Z3, right?

22:40.976 --> 22:43.923
He was saying, "What did you think,
sex has gotta be about love?"

22:44.080 --> 22:45.252
She say anything back?

22:45.314 --> 22:47.260
Don't know,
I went to get the car.

22:47.316 --> 22:49.626
Guy's a real jerk,
but he tips good.

22:49.685 --> 22:50.686
The passenger tipped you?

22:50.753 --> 22:53.233
Well, he snatched the keys away
from her and got behind the wheel.

22:53.289 --> 22:54.290
She was barely in the car

22:54.357 --> 22:58.271
before he squealed out of here like
he was late for his last meal.

22:58.794 --> 22:59.864
She lied again.

22:59.929 --> 23:01.909
JACK: She had to say he was
in the passenger seat.

23:01.964 --> 23:04.137
That's the only way he could've
rolled down the embankment.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.338
ADAM: So he didn't.

23:05.835 --> 23:08.076
She dragged him to the edge,
pushed him over.

23:08.137 --> 23:11.675
This also means both shots
were fired in his direction.

23:11.741 --> 23:13.220
The one that
shattered the window,

23:13.275 --> 23:14.686
and the one that
stayed in his head.

23:14.744 --> 23:16.314
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

23:18.347 --> 23:19.587
Got our indictment.

23:19.648 --> 23:20.718
ADAM: Good.

23:21.350 --> 23:24.422
Now go arm wrestle
the Navy for jurisdiction.

23:27.890 --> 23:29.631
WAXMAN: You're saying that
the United States Navy,

23:29.692 --> 23:33.970
in order to protect a valuable
officer, would overlook murder.

23:34.530 --> 23:37.977
I'm saying if I chose to, I could
charge Lieutenant Blair with perjury.

23:38.033 --> 23:40.479
If Mr. McCoy has some
facts to share with us,

23:40.536 --> 23:44.006
we'd be more than happy to consider
them in our investigation.

23:44.073 --> 23:48.112
Their investigation amounts to taking
dictation from Lieutenant Blair.

23:48.177 --> 23:49.952
(SCOFFS)
That's ridiculous.

23:50.012 --> 23:52.822
In any event, according
to Solorio v. the US,

23:52.882 --> 23:54.555
the Navy can
assert jurisdiction

23:54.617 --> 23:56.255
over cases involving
its personnel.

23:56.318 --> 23:59.629
We're contending our concurrent
jurisdiction takes precedence.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.032
We're ready to proceed
against Lieutenant Blair

24:02.091 --> 24:03.570
while the Navy's
been dragging its feet.

24:03.626 --> 24:06.072
That's completely inaccurate.
We've recovered Stroud's weapon.

24:06.128 --> 24:09.109
And we've indicted Lieutenant
Blair for murder two.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.071
This is dated
four days ago.

24:13.803 --> 24:15.407
Your Honor,
this is bad faith.

24:15.471 --> 24:17.815
While Mr. McCoy and Mr.
Schiff were stringing us along,

24:17.873 --> 24:20.319
Ms. Ross was tap dancing
for the grand jury.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.652
They must've liked
what they heard.

24:22.711 --> 24:26.488
I'm afraid Lieutenant Blair is going
to have to have a civilian attorney.

24:27.950 --> 24:32.365
"Docket number 77134,
People v. Kirstin Blair.

24:32.421 --> 24:34.992
"Charge is murder in
the second degree."

24:37.493 --> 24:39.564
I see a defendant,
I see a prosecutor,

24:39.628 --> 24:41.630
why don't I see
the defense counsel?

24:41.697 --> 24:43.506
MILLER: I'm right here,
Your Honor.

24:44.200 --> 24:47.943
Though why I'm here and why my
client is here is a mystery to me.

24:48.003 --> 24:49.209
TISDALE: Can we get a plea?

24:49.271 --> 24:50.409
Not guilty, ma'am.

24:50.473 --> 24:53.010
The People request
bail of $250,000.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.555
My client has
a spotless record.

24:55.611 --> 24:58.490
She is a commissioned officer
in the United States Navy.

24:58.547 --> 25:00.049
Her word of honor
should suffice.

25:00.115 --> 25:01.651
We ask that she be ROR'ed.

25:01.717 --> 25:03.719
Her ship is about to
sail for Newport News.

25:03.786 --> 25:05.094
COLEMAN: With your permission,
Your Honor,

25:05.154 --> 25:06.599
I'm Lieutenant
Commander Coleman

25:06.655 --> 25:08.498
of the Judge
Advocate General's office,

25:08.557 --> 25:09.934
and I state for the record

25:09.992 --> 25:12.233
that the Navy will not
remove Lieutenant Blair

25:12.294 --> 25:13.739
from the jurisdiction
of this court.

25:13.796 --> 25:15.332
These are the same people
who don't seem to feel

25:15.397 --> 25:18.241
the Lieutenant's criminal
actions warrant prosecution.

25:18.300 --> 25:20.644
This is a federal writ of
prohibition which bars the Navy

25:20.703 --> 25:22.683
from transporting
or transferring

25:22.738 --> 25:24.649
the defendant
outside the jurisdiction.

25:25.107 --> 25:28.520
Has the D.A. declared war
on the US Navy, Ms. Ross?

25:28.577 --> 25:30.215
Just making sure,
Your Honor.

25:30.613 --> 25:32.149
So noted.

25:32.214 --> 25:34.216
The defendant is ROR'ed

25:34.283 --> 25:36.092
and will not leave
the jurisdiction

25:36.151 --> 25:37.960
without permission
from the court.

25:38.020 --> 25:39.328
(POUNDS GAVEL)

25:40.089 --> 25:44.595
Jamie, that writ of prohibition
was a little over the top.

25:45.060 --> 25:47.768
We're finding we need a big stick
to get the Navy's attention.

25:47.830 --> 25:49.969
Careful where you step.

25:50.032 --> 25:51.443
I'm a Lieutenant
in the Reserves.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.673
I was in the JAG office
in the '70s.

25:53.736 --> 25:55.841
Then you know how ridiculous
the Navy's rules are.

25:55.905 --> 25:58.146
I can see why she tried
to cover up the affair.

25:58.207 --> 26:01.051
If she'll come clean now, we can discuss
dropping the charges to manslaughter.

26:01.110 --> 26:02.589
She's not guilty.

26:02.645 --> 26:04.352
(SCOFFS) Come on, Ruthie, every
time she opens her mouth,

26:04.413 --> 26:05.448
another lie pops out.

26:05.514 --> 26:06.822
Look at her statement
to the Navy.

26:06.882 --> 26:08.452
What statement?

26:09.485 --> 26:11.192
The statement
is inadmissible.

26:11.253 --> 26:13.233
My client wasn't
properly Mirandized.

26:13.289 --> 26:15.030
The spirit of
Miranda was adhered to,

26:15.090 --> 26:18.071
the essence of the protection
is embodied in JAG rules.

26:18.127 --> 26:20.107
Under the Uniform Code
of Military Justice,

26:20.162 --> 26:22.233
there is no right
to remain silent,

26:22.298 --> 26:24.778
there is no protection
against self-incrimination.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.835
This is the spirit
of Miranda?

26:26.902 --> 26:29.542
If she'd been arrested
and Mirandized by the NYPD,

26:29.605 --> 26:32.415
she'd still have given the same
self-serving, untruthful statement.

26:32.474 --> 26:35.683
If, if, if. Since that didn't
happen, we'll never know.

26:35.744 --> 26:37.883
No matter how you
slice it, Mr. McCoy,

26:37.947 --> 26:41.224
she was not
properly Mirandized.

26:41.283 --> 26:43.661
The statement
is inadmissible.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.264
Statement or not,
the facts are on our side.

26:47.323 --> 26:50.270
Facts don't win cases.
Make a deal.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.197
I'm not handing Blair
the keys to the city.

26:53.262 --> 26:55.936
I'll give on sentencing, but she
has to plead to murder two.

26:55.998 --> 26:57.841
Why play tough?
At most it's man one.

26:57.900 --> 26:59.880
She acted under
extreme emotional distress.

26:59.935 --> 27:01.812
That's a very
charitable spin.

27:02.471 --> 27:04.508
The fact is, we don't know what
really happened in that car.

27:04.573 --> 27:07.486
She really killed him.
She really lied.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.921
If you weren't so starry-eyed
over the great Kirstin Blair...

27:09.979 --> 27:13.188
What, because I think she committed
manslaughter instead of murder? Come on!

27:14.550 --> 27:18.930
Adam, you want this plea, so
tell me, murder two or man one?

27:18.988 --> 27:22.265
Kirstin Blair is the best thing
to happen to military aviation

27:22.324 --> 27:24.133
since Eddie Rickenbacker.

27:24.193 --> 27:27.470
Her picture is on every
little girl's bedroom wall

27:27.529 --> 27:30.169
right next to Sally Ride.

27:30.332 --> 27:32.005
Your case.

27:38.090 --> 27:39.296
Murder two,
15-to-life.

27:39.358 --> 27:40.701
MILLER: Please.

27:40.759 --> 27:42.966
She defends herself
against an armed attacker,

27:43.028 --> 27:46.805
a gun, his gun,
accidentally discharges.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.773
We might go to man one.

27:49.535 --> 27:50.570
You're gonna have to go
all the way down to,

27:50.636 --> 27:53.276
"Oops, sorry, we made a mistake,
we're dropping the charges."

27:53.338 --> 27:54.476
Don't hold your breath.

27:54.540 --> 27:56.019
MILLER: Have you looked at
Stroud's service record?

27:56.075 --> 27:57.679
We've subpoenaed it.
We're still waiting.

27:57.743 --> 28:00.223
The man was a pig.
Come on, Kirstin.

28:00.345 --> 28:03.849
I see. We're going to try the defendant,
you're gonna try the victim.

28:03.916 --> 28:06.795
The victim here is
Lieutenant Blair.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.671
You don't just jump in with an
offer that we haven't discussed.

28:14.727 --> 28:17.606
Excuse me, now I need permission
to join the conversation?

28:17.663 --> 28:19.472
And besides, we did
discuss it, with Adam,

28:19.531 --> 28:21.238
who doesn't seem to feel
we have much of a case.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.973
We can support murder
two on the evidence.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.174
The worst thing the woman did
was get pushed over the edge

28:25.237 --> 28:26.910
by the Navy and
that bastard Stroud.

28:26.972 --> 28:29.578
Every single piece
of evidence we have

28:29.641 --> 28:32.053
contradicts her
version of events.

28:32.778 --> 28:34.553
Damn it!

28:34.613 --> 28:35.921
Here's Stroud's record.

28:36.615 --> 28:38.720
And this is
a summary of Blair's.

28:38.784 --> 28:42.698
Draft a new subpoena.
I want her entire record, warts and all.

28:42.755 --> 28:45.429
Now you're getting paranoid.
Maybe they just believe her story.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.596
Sure, it's a classic
she-said, he-said

28:47.693 --> 28:49.798
except she made sure he wasn't
around to do the he-said.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.364
So now it's a
she-said, you-said.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.239
Lying does not
help her credibility.

28:53.298 --> 28:55.005
If the Navy's rules
about adultery

28:55.067 --> 28:56.910
and fraternization
weren't so medieval,

28:56.969 --> 28:57.970
she wouldn't
have to lie.

28:58.036 --> 29:00.516
Blair knew the rules!
She didn't have to join the Navy!

29:00.572 --> 29:05.851
Don't you people have a murder
trial starting in 11 hours?

29:05.911 --> 29:07.447
And remember,
it is a murder trial,

29:07.513 --> 29:11.620
not a debate between Gloria
Steinem and George Patton.

29:16.421 --> 29:19.459
JACK: You will hear
a fingerprint expert testify

29:19.525 --> 29:23.098
that the defendant was
in control of the gun.

29:24.863 --> 29:27.810
You will hear
ballistics evidence

29:28.367 --> 29:31.348
that the shooting
was not accidental.

29:31.837 --> 29:34.818
You will hear from witnesses
who overheard conversations

29:34.873 --> 29:37.752
between Mr. Stroud
and Ms. Blair

29:37.810 --> 29:39.915
on the night that
he was murdered.

29:39.978 --> 29:43.892
At the conclusion of the People's
case, you will be convinced

29:44.049 --> 29:48.088
that Lieutenant Blair is guilty
of murder in the second degree.

29:50.689 --> 29:55.399
Lieutenant Blair made two mistakes.
She fell in love with a cad,

29:56.261 --> 29:58.605
and she broke the Navy's
antediluvian rules

29:58.664 --> 30:01.110
regarding
romantic involvements.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.881
She knew the Navy applies
those rules capriciously,

30:05.304 --> 30:08.217
different spanks
for different ranks.

30:08.674 --> 30:11.746
A slap on the wrist
for adulterous admirals,

30:11.877 --> 30:14.949
imprisonment for
philandering lieutenants.

30:16.148 --> 30:19.220
She and Mr. Stroud tried
to cover up their affair.

30:19.284 --> 30:22.163
And when Lieutenant Blair
tried to end the deception,

30:22.221 --> 30:24.462
Mr. Stroud showed
his true colors.

30:25.724 --> 30:28.637
He had a gun.
He threatened her with it.

30:29.194 --> 30:31.265
Far from losing control,
she kept her cool

30:31.330 --> 30:33.708
and was able to
withstand his attack.

30:35.200 --> 30:38.545
Mr. Stroud's death
was an accident

30:38.604 --> 30:41.778
for which he himself
bears the responsibility.

30:43.909 --> 30:46.685
You will hear two
versions of this story.

30:46.778 --> 30:49.554
The truth lies in
Kirstin Blair's character.

30:58.991 --> 31:03.201
My parents taught me the essence of
good character isn't about perfection,

31:03.662 --> 31:06.973
it's about owning your mistakes
and learning from them.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.301
She's good.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.471
Special media training.

31:09.534 --> 31:10.774
MAN ON TV:
Let me ask you, Kirstin,

31:11.536 --> 31:15.484
what's it like landing an F-14
on a carrier deck at night?

31:15.540 --> 31:17.884
I mean, that sounds
really scary.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.684
A good pilot doesn't
even break a sweat.

31:21.747 --> 31:23.090
If you're going to just
sit there and worry about

31:23.148 --> 31:25.253
what all could go wrong,
you shouldn't be there.

31:25.317 --> 31:28.196
CHUCK ON TV: Why did you want
to be a Navy pilot?

31:28.253 --> 31:30.358
Where else could I
do what I love doing

31:30.422 --> 31:32.424
while at the same time
defending liberty.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.901
MILLER: This is the kind
of patriotism and dedication

31:35.961 --> 31:38.134
the Navy is willing
to sacrifice, Chuck.

31:38.196 --> 31:41.439
Well, they say they need their
rules about sexual conduct.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.343
This is not about
military necessity.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.872
This is about big government
trying to legislate morality.

31:46.939 --> 31:51.115
Not just in sexual matters, but
in every area of our lives,

31:51.176 --> 31:53.554
including what you can and
can't watch on television.

31:54.179 --> 31:56.489
MAN: We'll continue our...
(TURNS OFF TV)

31:56.548 --> 31:58.391
Get a gag order.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.923
McNEIL: I take it you saw
the Chuck Baxter show.

32:04.990 --> 32:07.596
Ms. Miller seems to favor the
court of public opinion.

32:07.659 --> 32:09.639
MILLER: The jury is
sequestered, Jack.

32:09.695 --> 32:11.834
They're allowed conjugal visits.
You think they don't talk?

32:11.897 --> 32:14.036
They're forbidden
to discuss the case.

32:14.599 --> 32:17.079
I'm going to issue
the gag order, Ms. Miller.

32:17.135 --> 32:19.342
You and your client are
forbidden to discuss this case

32:19.404 --> 32:22.817
with any non-party or non-witness
outside the courtroom.

32:22.874 --> 32:25.081
Bailiff,
let's bring in the jury.

32:25.811 --> 32:30.021
She broke it off last fall, she
said she'd found real love,

32:30.082 --> 32:35.430
"everlasting" was the word she
used, with someone on her ship.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.564
No further questions.

32:39.524 --> 32:42.403
Isn't it true you tried to break
off the relationship last summer?

32:42.594 --> 32:44.369
Yes.
MILLER: Why?

32:45.130 --> 32:48.543
She started getting
kind of possessive.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.170
And it wasn't
that serious for me.

32:50.235 --> 32:53.808
Are you saying that the relationship
meant more to her than to you?

32:54.673 --> 32:56.414
Yes, it seemed that way.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.250
Was she obsessed
with you?

32:59.177 --> 33:00.815
I don't know
about obsessed.

33:00.879 --> 33:04.349
Was she upset when you tried to break
off the relationship with her?

33:04.416 --> 33:05.417
Yes.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.486
She didn't try to
kill you, did she?

33:10.389 --> 33:11.424
No.

33:13.158 --> 33:16.264
Thank you.
No further questions.

33:17.562 --> 33:19.769
MRS. STROUD: He always
came back to me.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.606
I guess he was
just one of those men

33:21.666 --> 33:24.112
who needed more than one
woman could give him.

33:25.303 --> 33:27.874
At any time, did he talk to
you about Lieutenant Blair?

33:29.574 --> 33:31.417
After I caught
them in the bar,

33:31.476 --> 33:34.514
he told me that she was
the one who had it bad.

33:34.579 --> 33:36.820
He said for him it was just
a fling like the others.

33:36.882 --> 33:38.259
It wasn't serious.

33:44.589 --> 33:46.535
Did you believe him?
Yes.

33:46.591 --> 33:49.800
Did you ask him to stop
seeing Lieutenant Blair?

33:49.861 --> 33:51.033
Yes.

33:51.096 --> 33:52.234
Did he stop?

33:52.864 --> 33:53.865
No.

33:53.932 --> 33:55.309
Did he tell you why?

33:56.835 --> 33:58.246
Answer the question,
Mrs. Stroud.

34:03.341 --> 34:07.653
He said that she was better in bed
than me, that she made him hotter.

34:07.712 --> 34:11.181
And you didn't take this as a
serious threat to your marriage?

34:11.248 --> 34:14.025
That's right. Then why did
you file a formal complaint?

34:14.085 --> 34:16.327
Why did you risk publicly
humiliating yourself

34:16.388 --> 34:19.232
and ruining his career
in order to stop the affair?

34:20.492 --> 34:22.870
I don't know.
I was angry at him.

34:23.862 --> 34:26.967
But he loved me. Not her.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.679
I investigated
the alleged relationship

34:31.735 --> 34:34.376
between Lieutenant Blair
and Chief Stroud.

34:34.438 --> 34:36.315
They denied the allegations.

34:36.373 --> 34:38.047
I reminded them both

34:38.110 --> 34:40.090
that the Uniform Code
of Military Justice

34:40.145 --> 34:42.784
prohibits adultery
and fraternization.

34:42.848 --> 34:45.795
And what's the punishment for these kinds
of violations, Commander Halibert?

34:46.083 --> 34:47.495
HALIBERT: The maximum?

34:47.552 --> 34:51.159
Court-martial, dishonorable
discharge, possible prison term.

34:52.456 --> 34:53.697
As a naval officer,

34:53.757 --> 34:55.635
would Lieutenant Blair
have been aware

34:55.694 --> 34:58.334
of these sanctions
prior to her affair?

34:58.396 --> 35:00.603
The Uniform Code
of Military Justice

35:00.665 --> 35:03.544
is required learning
for all naval officers.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.713
And she had
the affair anyway.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.750
Mr. Stroud must've
meant a great deal to her.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.615
Objection.
Withdrawn.

35:09.674 --> 35:11.483
No further questions.

35:14.813 --> 35:18.090
You put people in prison for
adultery, is that right?

35:18.316 --> 35:20.227
Yes.
Outside of the Middle East,

35:20.285 --> 35:22.765
can you name any
civilized society

35:23.321 --> 35:25.460
that puts adulterers
behind bars?

35:25.857 --> 35:27.962
HALIBERT: I'm not
qualified to answer that.

35:28.326 --> 35:32.706
Our rules exist to maintain good order
and discipline within the ranks.

35:33.231 --> 35:37.646
You can't apply civilian
morality to military culture.

35:37.702 --> 35:43.175
What about sexual harassment, is
that an infraction of the rules?

35:43.241 --> 35:46.620
Yes. The punishment depends on
the severity of the offense.

35:46.678 --> 35:50.888
Defense's eight, Chief
Stroud's service record.

35:52.284 --> 35:53.661
Commander Halibert,

35:53.718 --> 35:58.531
how many sexual harassment
complaints do you see in his file?

36:00.091 --> 36:01.161
Eleven.

36:01.226 --> 36:02.432
Does the file indicate

36:02.494 --> 36:05.941
what punishment Stroud
received for his behavior?

36:05.997 --> 36:08.773
I was the one who
imposed the penalty.

36:08.833 --> 36:12.110
He was confined to his ship and ordered
to undergo gender-sensitivity training.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.775
Touchy-feely classes?

36:15.674 --> 36:18.280
Commander, isn't it true

36:18.343 --> 36:20.721
that you were so busy
stamping out adultery,

36:20.779 --> 36:23.487
you let a sexual predator like
Stroud fall between the cracks?

36:23.548 --> 36:26.961
We're in a politically
mandated situation, ma'am.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.156
It's new to us,

36:28.220 --> 36:33.169
but we're making every effort to meet the
expectations of the civilian authorities.

36:34.359 --> 36:36.805
You're doing
the best you can?

36:37.395 --> 36:38.396
Yes.

36:40.498 --> 36:42.341
Thank you, Commander.

36:47.005 --> 36:48.313
I'm just swatting
at an image.

36:48.373 --> 36:49.477
Swat harder.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.952
I don't have
enough ammunition.

36:51.009 --> 36:52.488
Blair's service record,
finally.

36:54.179 --> 36:57.217
Have a pleasant evening.
And good luck.

36:58.516 --> 37:02.396
I love the Navy's idea of unabridged.
Most of it's classified.

37:02.454 --> 37:04.400
Now I'm getting paranoid.

37:05.924 --> 37:08.837
What seems to be missing
are her training records.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.804
She trained at
Miramar Naval Air Station.

37:10.862 --> 37:13.934
I called them, but all I
got was the run-around.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.239
What are they hiding?

37:15.300 --> 37:16.472
Beats me.

37:16.534 --> 37:18.207
But I did get the names
of the training personnel

37:18.270 --> 37:20.147
on the carrier
where she got qualified.

37:20.205 --> 37:22.549
This one, Ottenberg, left the
service a few months ago.

37:22.607 --> 37:24.780
He might talk.
I'm tracking him down.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.018
I want him in my office.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.616
OTTENBERG: I was landing signal
officer on the Minnesota.

37:30.682 --> 37:33.356
I was there when Blair
trained for night landings.

37:33.418 --> 37:35.694
If they'd left it up to me, I
wouldn't have qualified her.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.995
Why not?
She had five downs.

37:38.290 --> 37:39.394
Downs?

37:40.292 --> 37:44.104
Major mistakes. Everybody else,
it's two downs, you're out.

37:44.162 --> 37:46.039
Two? They don't give you
much leeway, do they?

37:46.097 --> 37:48.703
No, sir. You don't want a pilot
that can't land the damn plane.

37:48.900 --> 37:50.573
Why'd they make
an exception for Blair?

37:53.204 --> 37:56.913
They were under orders to qualify
some female pilots ASAP.

37:56.975 --> 37:58.215
This stuff burns me up.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.017
What?
Qualifying female pilots?

38:00.078 --> 38:02.456
No, ma'am.
Qualifying bad pilots.

38:02.514 --> 38:03.584
She's that bad?

38:03.648 --> 38:04.991
She got better,

38:06.551 --> 38:09.464
but she's never
gonna be an F-14 pilot.

38:09.521 --> 38:12.195
You think I'm wrong,
listen to this.

38:12.724 --> 38:16.536
I kept it to cover my ass,
and I'm glad I did.

38:24.069 --> 38:28.040
I felt I could no longer wear the
uniform while lying to my superiors.

38:28.106 --> 38:30.245
MILLER: How did Mr. Stroud
take the rejection?

38:30.308 --> 38:32.015
BLAIR: He got very angry.

38:32.077 --> 38:34.990
He told me to take
the wheel and drive. I did.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.021
Were you afraid of him?
No.

38:37.082 --> 38:41.462
I can take care of myself.
I just didn't want to pour salt in the wound.

38:42.253 --> 38:43.891
MILLER: What happened next?

38:44.322 --> 38:47.462
He pulled a gun
and had me stop on the road.

38:47.525 --> 38:50.028
He told me to
get out of the car.

38:50.095 --> 38:53.406
When he turned away to open
his door, I grabbed the gun.

38:53.465 --> 38:56.309
We struggled.
The gun went off twice.

38:56.368 --> 39:00.714
One bullet shattered the driver's
window and the other killed him.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.821
Did you intend
to shoot him?

39:05.877 --> 39:07.322
No.

39:07.379 --> 39:09.381
It was an accident.

39:10.815 --> 39:13.386
The impact of the bullet had
knocked him out of the car.

39:13.451 --> 39:15.988
I went to see if
he was badly hurt.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.465
He was dead.

39:17.522 --> 39:19.365
MILLER: What did you do then?

39:19.424 --> 39:20.562
BLAIR: I drove off.

39:21.926 --> 39:23.337
Why did you do that?

39:23.395 --> 39:26.239
I left the scene to
report the accident.

39:26.297 --> 39:28.971
I headed back towards the ship
but by the time I got there,

39:29.033 --> 39:31.946
I started to see how unlikely
it was I'd be believed.

39:32.937 --> 39:35.747
I've seen what happens to
women who try to fight back.

39:36.674 --> 39:40.212
The system is stacked against
us, especially in the military.

39:41.112 --> 39:42.216
That seems cold.

39:42.414 --> 39:46.226
BLAIR: I've been trained to make
quick, calculated decisions.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.199
In this case,
I made a very bad decision,

39:50.255 --> 39:52.462
one I'll be sorry for
for the rest of my life.

39:52.524 --> 39:56.495
I can't excuse it, but I truly
thought I would not be believed.

39:59.497 --> 40:03.172
And, in fact, you were
right, weren't you?

40:04.335 --> 40:05.609
Well, I'm here.

40:06.204 --> 40:07.478
Thank you.

40:11.543 --> 40:14.080
It is your contention,

40:14.145 --> 40:16.182
on the night of
Mr. Stroud's death,

40:16.247 --> 40:18.557
you were breaking
up with him?

40:18.616 --> 40:21.028
The man you described
as your everlasting love?

40:21.085 --> 40:22.325
The man of your dreams?

40:22.387 --> 40:23.991
Yes, I broke up with him.

40:24.055 --> 40:26.399
We've heard testimony
from a waiter

40:26.458 --> 40:30.201
and a parking lot attendant that
contradicts your story. Were they wrong?

40:30.595 --> 40:32.472
They didn't hear
the whole discussion.

40:32.530 --> 40:37.206
Mr. Stroud humiliated you.
You must've been angry.

40:37.869 --> 40:40.440
I have been trained
to control my emotions.

40:40.505 --> 40:43.213
Under all circumstances?
They never break free?

40:43.775 --> 40:44.913
No, they don't.

40:44.976 --> 40:46.387
You never lose control?

40:47.445 --> 40:49.015
You want to know
how I conduct myself,

40:49.080 --> 40:51.822
take a look at
my service record.

40:51.883 --> 40:55.228
When you do what I do, losing
control is not an option.

40:56.387 --> 40:58.560
You lose control, you die.

41:00.391 --> 41:02.701
People's 17.

41:05.497 --> 41:07.943
This is a recording

41:07.999 --> 41:12.379
of US Navy training
flight number 001954,

41:12.437 --> 41:13.916
the carrier Minnesota.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.318
Do you recall that
flight, Ms. Blair?

41:18.376 --> 41:22.051
Your Honor, I renew my objection
to this so-called evidence.

41:22.447 --> 41:24.791
So noted.
Go on, Mr. McCoy.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.827
Do you know
what's on this tape?

41:32.023 --> 41:33.764
I'll refresh your memory.

41:35.393 --> 41:38.806
The voices you'll hear belong to
Lieutenant William Ottenberg,

41:38.863 --> 41:41.901
landing signal officer
on the carrier Minnesota,

41:42.133 --> 41:44.170
and to Lieutenant Blair

41:44.235 --> 41:46.806
in an F-14 on approach
for a night landing

41:46.871 --> 41:49.784
on the carrier
off of San Diego.

41:54.979 --> 41:56.219
OTTENBERG:
Blair, you're next in line.

41:56.281 --> 41:57.487
BLAIR: Negative, I'm not.

41:57.549 --> 41:59.392
OTTENBERG: Check your lineup, Blair.
Watch the meatball.

41:59.450 --> 42:02.556
BLAIR: I can't do this!
I can barely see the deck lights.

42:02.620 --> 42:03.997
OTTENBERG:
Keep your scan moving.

42:04.055 --> 42:05.193
BLAIR: (HYSTERICALLY)
I can't! I'm gonna crash!

42:05.256 --> 42:06.326
OTTENBERG: Right for lineup.

42:06.391 --> 42:07.529
BLAIR: I can't do it!

42:07.592 --> 42:09.230
OTTENBERG: Wave off
Wave off Wave off

42:09.294 --> 42:11.171
BLAIR: Oh, my God!
OTTENBERG: Raise your gear, raise your gear.

42:11.229 --> 42:12.503
BLAIR: I'm trying. Oh, God!

42:12.564 --> 42:14.237
OTTENBERG: Burner,
burner, burner.

42:16.868 --> 42:19.246
OTTENBERG: Fifty-four, what's your status?
Fifty-four?

42:19.304 --> 42:21.147
BLAIR: I can't do this,
Ottenberg.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.309
Hand me off to Miramar.

42:22.373 --> 42:23.511
OTTENBERG: Bring her
back around. You can do it.

42:23.575 --> 42:25.919
BLAIR: No. Hand me off
Let me make a ground landing.

42:25.977 --> 42:27.615
OTTENBERG: This is a
training flight, Lieutenant.

42:27.679 --> 42:29.215
You already know how
to make ground landings.

42:29.280 --> 42:32.124
BLAIR: Yeah, because I had good
trainers, not morons, like you.

42:32.183 --> 42:33.218
OTTENBERG:
Cool it, Lieutenant.

42:33.284 --> 42:34.285
BLAIR: You screw me over,

42:34.352 --> 42:36.491
I'm gonna rip you
a new one.

42:50.735 --> 42:52.544
Did you rip him a new one?

42:57.575 --> 42:59.418
I filed a report.

42:59.544 --> 43:02.184
Was this your first attempt
at a night landing?

43:04.916 --> 43:06.554
No, it was my third.

43:07.118 --> 43:09.655
How many years have you been
in the Navy, Ms. Blair?

43:10.154 --> 43:11.326
Five-and-a-half.

43:11.389 --> 43:13.960
This recording was
made six months ago.

43:15.426 --> 43:16.564
At what point did you learn

43:16.628 --> 43:20.405
the steely control of your
emotions you alluded to earlier?

43:27.005 --> 43:28.348
McNEIL: Ms. Blair?

43:35.179 --> 43:40.424
She doesn't have to answer,
Your Honor.

43:40.485 --> 43:41.930
No more questions.

44:05.009 --> 44:07.455
This morning
Kirstin Blair allocuted

44:07.512 --> 44:10.891
and pled guilty to the charge of
manslaughter in the first degree.

44:10.948 --> 44:13.622
Judge McNeil imposed sentence
of twelve-and-a-half-to-25,

44:13.685 --> 44:16.962
as agreed to by the district
attorney's office and Ms. Blair.

44:17.021 --> 44:19.194
Did she admit she
killed him deliberately?

44:19.257 --> 44:21.828
I think the guilty
plea speaks for itself.

44:21.893 --> 44:23.497
Not necessarily.

44:23.561 --> 44:25.131
Ms. Blair! Ms. Blair!
Kirstin! Kirstin!

44:25.196 --> 44:27.142
Kirstin,
why'd you cop a plea?

44:27.198 --> 44:28.575
When you have the US Navy

44:28.633 --> 44:30.806
and the authorities of the
New York State government

44:30.868 --> 44:33.974
aligned against you in
pressing an unjust charge,

44:34.038 --> 44:37.747
well, sometimes concession
is the better part of valor.

44:37.809 --> 44:41.382
Our training methods
undergo constant evaluation,

44:41.446 --> 44:43.653
but in any
large organizations,

44:43.715 --> 44:45.558
things sometimes
fall through the cracks.

44:45.616 --> 44:46.993
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)

44:47.051 --> 44:49.657
So, it's man one.
You were right.

44:49.721 --> 44:51.826
If you're trying to make
me feel better, thanks.

44:51.889 --> 44:54.233
It's like finding Amelia
Earhart flew to Bakersfield

44:54.292 --> 44:56.329
and hid out
for 50 years.

44:57.295 --> 44:59.172
I got over Pete Rose.

45:00.305 --> 45:06.461
