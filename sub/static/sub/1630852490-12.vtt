Part 12
Even Nameless Flowers Bloom with All Their Might

01:06.530 --> 01:08.860
I was kidnapped mid-day by someone.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.860
I think my schedule will get messed up.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.000
So I'm taking measures in advance.

01:14.940 --> 01:16.810
The weather is so nice, huh?

01:17.180 --> 01:19.590
I don't know why, but I'm excited.

01:19.880 --> 01:20.920
What's wrong with you?

01:21.990 --> 01:22.960
If you change your personality,

01:22.960 --> 01:24.070
I won't re-sign with you.

01:24.070 --> 01:26.140
I can go where you go.

01:27.030 --> 01:28.220
You want me to marry you?

01:28.220 --> 01:29.220
Hey.

01:29.420 --> 01:31.520
This is a comedy, not a documentary.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.240
You won't make it on comedy shows at this rate.

01:33.240 --> 01:36.180
A comedy show that's not fun or moving

01:36.310 --> 01:37.990
should get canceled.

01:46.259 --> 01:48.890
Bbiyong is shameless and brazen.

01:48.990 --> 01:50.820
- He should be mindful...
- What?

01:50.820 --> 01:52.690
How dare he go around drunk?

01:52.710 --> 01:55.610
Does Bbiyong even know how to feel guilty?

01:55.690 --> 01:58.820
Doesn't it seem like Bbiyong is acting

01:58.820 --> 02:01.720
as if he's a solitary and free soul?

02:01.840 --> 02:03.030
What a drama queen!

02:03.030 --> 02:05.550
Why do you look so dark?

02:06.700 --> 02:07.700
It's Bbiyong.

02:08.600 --> 02:09.910
Have you heard from him?

02:10.500 --> 02:11.430
The legal team said

02:11.430 --> 02:13.990
they sent a notice about suing him for indemnity.

02:13.990 --> 02:16.070
But he said he won't stand by either,

02:16.220 --> 02:18.090
and he'll sue us for slander.

02:18.090 --> 02:19.090
Idiot.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.360
He knows he can't win so why?

02:22.360 --> 02:23.800
He's not an idiot.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.110
He just doesn't know me yet.

02:29.150 --> 02:29.810
Hello?

02:29.810 --> 02:31.329
Sir, where are you?

02:31.700 --> 02:33.280
You need to come in.

02:34.250 --> 02:36.300
Let go! I said let go!

02:36.300 --> 02:38.579
- Don't film this!
- Hey! I'm Bbiyong!

02:38.610 --> 02:40.200
You know how much I did for Starpeace?

02:40.200 --> 02:41.050
- Come on.
- Hey!

02:41.050 --> 02:42.140
Bring CEO Cha.

02:42.320 --> 02:43.320
- Bring him here!
- Hey, hey, hey.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.630
- Are you ignoring me?
- Hey, hey, hey.

02:44.630 --> 02:46.060
- Go on out. Go.
- Hey!

02:46.060 --> 02:47.740
Bring CEO Cha, darn it!

02:47.920 --> 02:49.160
- Hey!
- Bring CEO Cha!

02:49.160 --> 02:50.460
- Stop this!
- Bring Che Jae-hyuk!

02:57.579 --> 02:58.579
You bastard.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.760
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

03:01.840 --> 03:03.770
- Stop this!
- Get over here!

03:03.890 --> 03:05.000
Get over here, you bastard!

03:05.000 --> 03:05.720
That's enough!

03:05.720 --> 03:06.720
Let go!

03:14.080 --> 03:15.280
You bastards...

03:16.490 --> 03:17.180
Hey!

03:17.180 --> 03:18.190
Take Ji-han away.

03:18.190 --> 03:19.190
Let go.

03:20.130 --> 03:21.550
Let go of me!

03:21.640 --> 03:22.640
Let go!

03:24.530 --> 03:27.100
Hey! You coward!

03:27.310 --> 03:29.390
Don't hide behind others like a kid.

03:29.390 --> 03:30.690
Come here, you bastard!

03:30.690 --> 03:31.690
Come here!

03:35.340 --> 03:37.020
Shut up, Bong Chung-bong.

03:37.870 --> 03:39.310
Know when to stop.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.360
Got that?

03:51.870 --> 03:53.670
I heard he drinks all day.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.980
It's not because of you.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.100
You know that, right?

04:08.550 --> 04:10.000
Darn it!

04:11.130 --> 04:12.130
It's okay.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.870
If you have something to say,

04:15.870 --> 04:17.800
come back when you're sober.

04:18.610 --> 04:19.790
There are still many

04:19.790 --> 04:22.880
who remember you as Executive Bong.

04:42.990 --> 04:43.990
Yikes!

04:46.490 --> 04:47.270
How did you get in?

04:47.270 --> 04:48.950
What's up with Bbiyong?

04:50.710 --> 04:51.750
You saw that?

04:52.750 --> 04:53.790
It's nothing.

04:54.100 --> 04:55.050
You know this.

04:55.050 --> 04:57.250
He called me several times, saying it's unfair.

04:57.250 --> 04:59.670
He received the song, but he didn't listen to it.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.120
Do you think

05:05.980 --> 05:07.340
that makes sense?

05:09.840 --> 05:10.960
Director Yoon.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.550
It was just a one-time incident.

05:34.550 --> 05:37.150
You're saying it's not news-worthy.

05:37.810 --> 05:39.370
But that's for me to decide.

05:39.390 --> 05:41.450
I'm trying to help you make a quick decision.

05:41.450 --> 05:42.540
I'll use this photo and write

05:42.540 --> 05:44.340
a romance scandal about you two.

05:44.340 --> 05:46.140
You'll have to write fiction then.

05:46.140 --> 05:47.450
I doubt that.

05:47.510 --> 05:49.159
When people see this,

05:49.159 --> 05:51.030
they won't think it's fiction.

05:53.540 --> 05:55.490
Then go ahead and write it like that.

05:56.040 --> 05:57.670
If you want to do that so much,

05:57.700 --> 05:58.990
go ahead and do it.

06:11.790 --> 06:13.570
Then go ahead and write it like that.

06:13.570 --> 06:14.940
If you want to do that so much,

06:14.960 --> 06:16.020
go ahead and do it.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.590
He won't write it as it is.

06:27.130 --> 06:29.380
Reporter Mo's interest is in Ji-han.

06:29.380 --> 06:30.160
Me?

06:30.160 --> 06:32.880
Don't you remember how he got there that day?

06:32.880 --> 06:34.320
He's not an idiot.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.810
If he writes a scandal, it'll be with Ji-han.

06:37.460 --> 06:38.180
What should I...

06:38.180 --> 06:39.850
To get what you wanted,

06:39.850 --> 06:42.050
it's true you used Ji-han.

06:42.230 --> 06:44.310
Rather than let that go public,

06:45.110 --> 06:46.860
a romance scandal about us

06:47.200 --> 06:49.030
will be less threatening to Cotton Candy.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.070
Jae-hyuk!

06:50.430 --> 06:51.210
Sir!

06:51.210 --> 06:53.010
Of course, if that happens,

06:53.350 --> 06:55.760
Cotton Candy's achievement will be belittled.

06:56.110 --> 06:57.760
They'll say you made it

06:57.790 --> 06:59.360
because I supported you.

07:00.830 --> 07:02.520
It's not like there isn't another way.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.500
It's not like we didn't expect this.

07:05.070 --> 07:06.320
If things go bad,

07:06.340 --> 07:08.340
I'll use the information I gathered.

07:10.020 --> 07:13.150
Let's see what Reporter Mo does for now.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.560
Grandma.

07:14.730 --> 07:17.050
Why do you sound so weak?

07:17.050 --> 07:18.090
Are you sick?

07:18.250 --> 07:19.840
Not at all.

07:20.470 --> 07:22.470
I ate so much

07:22.780 --> 07:27.050
that I was dozing off like a chick in a nest.

07:27.050 --> 07:29.590
Don't just eat vegetables. Eat meat.

07:29.590 --> 07:31.410
I sent you a hefty allowance.

07:31.410 --> 07:32.350
Spend it!

07:32.350 --> 07:33.830
Okay.

07:34.659 --> 07:37.000
Okay, let's hang up now.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.620
What about the tonic I sent you?

07:38.620 --> 07:39.820
Are you taking that well?

07:39.820 --> 07:41.630
My fan sent it to me.

07:42.060 --> 07:43.550
It's really expensive.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.440
Don't forget to take it every day.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.120
Okay, I won't forget.

07:48.140 --> 07:50.100
I'm hanging up now.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.360
Grandma.

07:52.460 --> 07:53.770
I miss you.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.720
Can't you come to Seoul for a visit?

07:55.720 --> 07:57.860
If you get to Seoul Station, I'll go pick you up.

07:57.860 --> 07:59.580
I don't have time to go down.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.020
I don't, either.

08:01.770 --> 08:03.160
Let's hang up now.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.430
Why do you keep trying to hang up?

08:05.910 --> 08:07.360
What about the village head?

08:07.360 --> 08:09.040
Does he come by often?

08:09.090 --> 08:10.890
Does your new TV work well?

08:17.810 --> 08:20.050
Dan's song is getting a great response.

08:20.050 --> 08:22.220
Many are saying Chae-ah's voice is addictive.

08:22.380 --> 08:23.980
You mooched off Dan.

08:24.460 --> 08:25.800
Jeez.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.880
Just pretend to not notice.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.250
You know what Hyun-ji said?

08:34.409 --> 08:36.110
That I was the missing member

08:36.140 --> 08:37.070
in her dream.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.270
Haa!

08:38.340 --> 08:39.900
That I'll be hospitalized because

08:39.919 --> 08:41.250
Calla will attack me.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.270
Okay!

08:44.270 --> 08:45.780
I'll send Seok-chun out

08:45.780 --> 08:47.560
to the station at your arrival time.

08:47.690 --> 08:48.690
Okay.

08:48.970 --> 08:50.770
Wear the red scarf I bought you

08:50.770 --> 08:52.030
- and stand still.
- It's really good.

08:52.030 --> 08:53.380
Don't go anywhere.

08:53.380 --> 08:55.580
Even if you have to pee. Okay?

08:56.320 --> 08:57.540
Okay.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.880
Alright. I'll hang up now.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.050
Bye!

09:01.890 --> 09:02.920
Your grandma's coming?

09:02.920 --> 09:04.150
Yeah.

09:04.150 --> 09:05.780
She refused at first.

09:05.780 --> 09:07.860
But she misses her pretty granddaughter.

09:09.290 --> 09:10.610
When she gets here,

09:10.610 --> 09:11.850
she said she'll cook for us.

09:12.370 --> 09:13.140
Really?

09:13.140 --> 09:14.920
Yeah! I'm so happy!

09:15.010 --> 09:16.960
- I'm glad.
- I look forward to it.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.830
I'm Bbiyong!

09:21.330 --> 09:22.630
I'm here.

09:23.010 --> 09:26.170
Bring CEO Cha! Bring him to me!

09:26.530 --> 09:27.290
You bastard.

09:27.290 --> 09:29.090
What are you watching?

09:29.750 --> 09:31.620
I said bring CEO Cha!

09:31.620 --> 09:33.620
You saw him for the first time yesterday, huh?

09:36.090 --> 09:37.090
Yeah.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.590
I heard he lives like a total zombie.

09:41.310 --> 09:43.050
He called the other guys a few times.

09:43.300 --> 09:44.470
He was drunk.

09:45.110 --> 09:46.390
What did he say?

09:46.590 --> 09:48.110
That it was unfair.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.550
He was griping.

09:49.550 --> 09:51.890
Kept talking about the good old days.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.140
It's not pleasant to see

09:55.150 --> 09:56.450
a hero fall.

10:04.980 --> 10:06.020
Wow.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.110
Bbyong, that bastard.

10:07.110 --> 10:08.550
He's unbelievable.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.980
He still hasn't come to his senses.

10:11.510 --> 10:14.350
You know he kicked up a fuss here yesterday?

10:14.880 --> 10:15.830
What is it?

10:17.310 --> 10:18.500
No way.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.380
I heard he goes around saying he'll ruin us.

10:23.510 --> 10:25.300
He's such a phony big talker.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.750
How in the world will he ruin us?

10:27.750 --> 10:30.210
If he keeps causing a fuss like this,

10:30.250 --> 10:32.850
bad public opinion can form against us.

10:33.840 --> 10:35.960
Regardless of who was right or wrong.

10:38.410 --> 10:39.410
Bbiyong.

10:39.820 --> 10:41.070
Hang in there.

10:41.070 --> 10:43.060
We only have a few more days left.

10:54.660 --> 10:56.620
Hey, isn't that Bbiyong?

10:56.620 --> 10:57.510
Bbiyong?

10:57.510 --> 10:59.360
I heard he plagiarized.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.180
I should take a picture.

11:01.510 --> 11:03.200
- Let's take a photo.
- What's he doing?

11:03.250 --> 11:04.690
We'll upload this.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.240
He knows they're taking his photo.

11:15.260 --> 11:16.570
He's letting them.

11:16.570 --> 11:17.570
Why?

11:18.330 --> 11:21.130
To create noise. To make it into an issue.

11:21.130 --> 11:22.930
Cotton Candy is the target.

11:23.160 --> 11:23.950
To taint their image.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.830
That's stupid.

11:26.450 --> 11:28.680
He's ruining himself, too.

11:29.410 --> 11:31.820
Does he only think of getting revenge?

11:31.820 --> 11:33.060
Even after...

11:33.750 --> 11:35.510
Even after what he did?

11:49.490 --> 11:50.490
Stop.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.760
I heard you're CEO Ma's favorite.

11:54.760 --> 11:55.250
What?

11:55.250 --> 11:56.530
Do you know who I am?

11:56.530 --> 11:59.600
Yes. Starpeace's leading producer, Bbiyong.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.600
Come on.

12:00.900 --> 12:02.390
You left something out.

12:02.390 --> 12:03.390
Oh.

12:03.930 --> 12:05.790
Genius leading producer, Bbiyong.

12:08.950 --> 12:09.980
Sit down.

12:10.580 --> 12:11.860
I said sit down.

12:13.980 --> 12:14.980
Stand up.

12:17.420 --> 12:18.420
Sit down.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.680
Stand up.

12:22.850 --> 12:24.720
Don't stand up but sit down.

12:24.850 --> 12:27.370
Don't sit down. Don't stand up.

12:27.610 --> 12:28.810
Sit down.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.540
Hey.

12:32.090 --> 12:33.920
You always do as you're told?

12:33.920 --> 12:34.920
What?

12:38.280 --> 12:40.270
You're not CEO Ma's favorite.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.520
You're my favorite.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.730
You cute rascal.

12:45.940 --> 12:46.940
Hey.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.430
You're a promising rough stone.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.470
I'll sharpen and polish you

12:52.710 --> 12:54.570
so you'll become a gemstone.

13:00.300 --> 13:02.920
Our agency might look shabby now.

13:03.440 --> 13:04.880
But I'm confident.

13:05.930 --> 13:06.930
Look.

13:07.130 --> 13:08.490
I'm going to make

13:08.620 --> 13:10.620
everything here kneel at my feet.

13:12.140 --> 13:14.620
Want me to make them kneel at your feet, too?

13:17.660 --> 13:18.740
Hey!

13:19.260 --> 13:21.020
Wait!

13:21.190 --> 13:23.530
Here we come!

13:33.590 --> 13:35.710
Hey, Ji-han! Ji-han! Hey!

13:35.900 --> 13:36.900
Hey!

13:37.040 --> 13:38.440
Plagiarizing Bbyong.

13:38.620 --> 13:40.460
Don't live like that.

13:40.850 --> 13:44.580
How can you steal from my Cotton Candy?

13:44.750 --> 13:46.850
What's there to steal from them?

13:46.850 --> 13:48.260
Why'd you do it? Speak.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.560
That's him?

13:49.560 --> 13:51.140
The guy who stole from Cotton Candy?

13:51.140 --> 13:52.330
Yeah.

13:52.530 --> 13:55.190
He looks like he'll plagiarize.

13:55.190 --> 13:57.080
Yeah, he looks so sneaky.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.010
Plagiarizing Bbyong, Bbyong, Bbyong.

13:59.010 --> 14:00.740
Shut up, you bastards.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.210
You crazy?

14:03.210 --> 14:04.210
What?

14:13.400 --> 14:16.190
I should just crush you.

14:16.830 --> 14:18.920
- Ji-han, Ji-han.
- It's Mars.

14:19.430 --> 14:21.370
- It's Ji-han.
- Don't take photos.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.510
Don't take photos!

14:24.390 --> 14:25.390
Go now.

14:25.410 --> 14:26.410
Go!

14:26.480 --> 14:27.480
Film him.

14:28.280 --> 14:29.140
Bbiyong!

14:29.140 --> 14:30.750
- Bbiyong!
- It's Mars.

14:30.750 --> 14:32.660
We have to get this.

14:32.660 --> 14:33.550
Don't take photos.

14:33.550 --> 14:34.990
Don't take photos!

14:35.010 --> 14:36.700
Jeez!

14:36.730 --> 14:38.770
- Go now.
- Jeez.

14:38.790 --> 14:39.610
Jeez.

14:39.610 --> 14:41.180
That idiot.

14:42.430 --> 14:45.080
Why is Ji-han there?

14:46.530 --> 14:48.430
It'll be hard for him.

14:49.100 --> 14:52.170
The rumor Bbiyong raised Ji-han to his status...

14:53.610 --> 14:55.740
Half is wrong and half is right.

14:56.990 --> 14:58.830
I'm upset with Bbiyong.

14:59.770 --> 15:01.770
But seeing him like that makes me feel bad.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.850
He got his comeuppance.

15:03.850 --> 15:05.070
I'm happy.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.080
You don't look happy.

15:08.670 --> 15:09.830
What?

15:10.120 --> 15:12.140
I'm happy. I'm so happy.

15:13.020 --> 15:14.970
Whatever. Let's practice.

15:14.970 --> 15:16.900
We don't have time to dawdle.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.630
There's only a few days left. Come on.

15:19.410 --> 15:21.570
Don't drag your feet!

15:21.570 --> 15:22.570
Okay, okay.

15:22.940 --> 15:23.720
Let's go.

15:24.190 --> 15:25.870
Let's practice, Jenna.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.290
Why am I here?

16:06.810 --> 16:08.600
Are you going to keep living like this?

16:11.490 --> 16:12.770
Why ask me that?

16:14.850 --> 16:16.710
The ones who made me like this

16:17.700 --> 16:18.740
are you guys.

16:18.740 --> 16:19.740
No.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.040
The one who made you like that

16:23.360 --> 16:24.360
is you.

16:24.630 --> 16:25.580
What?

16:25.580 --> 16:27.330
Everyone in Korea knows.

16:27.890 --> 16:29.890
Why don't you?

16:30.380 --> 16:31.980
You know, don't you?

16:33.200 --> 16:34.820
The ones who made me like this

16:34.820 --> 16:37.130
are Kim Jenna, Seo Ji-han, Cha Jae-hyuk,

16:37.130 --> 16:39.090
Cotton Candy, Starpeace...

16:40.100 --> 16:41.450
All those crappy bastards.

16:41.450 --> 16:42.450
No.

16:42.610 --> 16:43.610
You know.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.970
That's why you're acting out!

16:45.970 --> 16:46.970
What?

16:50.170 --> 16:51.170
You should

16:51.930 --> 16:53.510
apologize to yourself.

16:53.510 --> 16:55.460
You were brilliant and talented.

16:55.460 --> 16:57.180
At one time, you were someone's role model.

16:57.180 --> 16:58.910
Apologize to that Bbiyong!

17:01.040 --> 17:03.270
Tell him you're sorry you ruined him.

17:09.750 --> 17:12.420
I don't want to hear your cheap lecture.

17:12.550 --> 17:13.550
Bbiyong!

17:17.710 --> 17:19.450
Your old songs

17:19.760 --> 17:21.119
were really good.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.470
They were so good

17:23.589 --> 17:26.190
that they didn't need more description.

17:28.660 --> 17:31.730
Many kids dreamt of song-writing because of you.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.020
You should have

17:37.320 --> 17:39.340
trusted yourself more.

17:42.530 --> 17:44.120
It's not too late.

17:46.020 --> 17:47.700
Go back to that Bbiyong.

17:53.940 --> 17:54.940
I can't.

17:57.700 --> 17:58.700
Now,

18:00.110 --> 18:01.530
I can't go back.

18:04.470 --> 18:06.150
Who will buy my songs?

18:06.930 --> 18:08.630
Who in the world

18:10.410 --> 18:12.350
will listen to a plagiarized songwriter's songs?

18:14.160 --> 18:15.830
I'm ruined.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.790
My life, my music, my career!

18:17.790 --> 18:18.950
All of it!

18:20.680 --> 18:21.840
Ruined...

18:35.720 --> 18:36.800
You.

18:39.980 --> 18:43.280
Many kids dreamt of song-writing because of you.

18:45.310 --> 18:46.310
I did, too.

18:47.950 --> 18:49.810
You made me want to create

18:51.770 --> 18:54.540
instead of just sing. You were a genius.

18:57.090 --> 18:58.130
That was you.

19:01.300 --> 19:04.200
You discarded the songs that weren't chosen.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.190
I even wanted to learn that haughtiness.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.290
Those unreleased songs you made then...

19:17.110 --> 19:18.110
I kept them.

19:21.130 --> 19:22.810
I still listen to them.

20:08.780 --> 20:09.780
Bbiyong.

20:14.060 --> 20:15.300
Bbyong.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.770
I was going to curse you forever.

20:19.230 --> 20:21.180
But our song will be released tomorrow.

20:21.180 --> 20:23.290
So for luck's sake, I'll let it slide.

20:24.420 --> 20:25.420
Instead,

20:25.770 --> 20:28.540
don't go around looking uncool.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.120
Here...

20:51.660 --> 20:52.990
You can't come?

20:54.150 --> 20:55.470
Grandma!

20:55.530 --> 20:58.010
Why do you keep changing your mind?

20:58.040 --> 21:00.510
You said you'll come!

21:02.070 --> 21:05.080
They're slaughtering a pig at the village hall?

21:05.320 --> 21:07.410
I'll buy you pork.

21:08.540 --> 21:09.850
Grandma.

21:10.310 --> 21:11.680
The village head's son had a daughter?

21:11.680 --> 21:13.510
What does that have to do with you?

21:14.170 --> 21:15.040
What?

21:15.040 --> 21:17.980
It's been 20 years since a baby cried there?

21:20.610 --> 21:21.610
Okay.

21:21.720 --> 21:23.520
Forget it. I'm hanging up.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.710
I'll never see you again.

21:27.590 --> 21:28.450
She can't come?

21:28.450 --> 21:29.710
Seriously.

21:30.140 --> 21:31.570
She chose the village head's granddaughter.

21:31.570 --> 21:33.900
Over me! How can that be?

21:34.550 --> 21:36.090
How could she?

21:39.270 --> 21:40.480
When we go on the music show,

21:40.480 --> 21:43.680
I was going to save her the best seat.

21:46.220 --> 21:48.770
Your grandma loves watching TV.

21:49.260 --> 21:50.260
Oh,

21:50.320 --> 21:52.460
and you're counting your chickens first.

21:52.460 --> 21:54.420
What if we don't make it to the music show?

21:56.060 --> 21:57.660
Don't say that, it's bad luck.

21:57.660 --> 21:59.110
They made us look like

21:59.110 --> 22:01.250
stiff stone figures in the promo poster.

22:01.250 --> 22:02.930
I'm worried as it is.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.730
This is...

22:06.910 --> 22:09.410
All the agency's fault.

22:09.410 --> 22:11.650
Why butt in?

22:12.650 --> 22:14.330
Call your grandma back.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.830
You said hurtful things. She'll be upset.

22:16.830 --> 22:17.830
Come on.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.150
I don't want to.

22:35.290 --> 22:36.650
They're vitamins.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.200
Stella.

22:52.330 --> 22:53.610
A long time ago,

22:54.300 --> 22:56.260
I had a much older sister.

22:57.330 --> 22:59.190
She wasn't able to stop taking medicine.

23:01.210 --> 23:03.010
So she took her life instead.

23:04.030 --> 23:06.700
I was too young, so I didn't know the details.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.380
But I was just scared.

23:09.890 --> 23:12.790
And sad that my sister suddenly disappeared.

23:14.700 --> 23:17.160
I'm glad you overcame it.

23:19.290 --> 23:21.420
You release your song tomorrow, right?

23:21.420 --> 23:22.220
Yes.

23:22.220 --> 23:23.500
You'll get No.1.

23:23.860 --> 23:24.860
Thank you.

23:27.180 --> 23:29.350
Cotton Candy "Finale," Singles No.1 on first day of release
Will they be No.1 on the music show?

23:29.350 --> 23:31.030
Cotton Candy releases new song in 6 years,
Dominates the charts

23:31.030 --> 23:32.850
Cotton Candy's new song "Finale" clicks...
Sweeps the charts

23:32.850 --> 23:34.600
Cotton Candy's "Finale" No.1 in Singles chart
The birth of a new dark horse?

23:34.600 --> 23:36.950
Eventful Cotton Candy's "Finale" No.1 in Singles chart
The journey from climbing the charts to becoming No.1

23:36.950 --> 23:38.800
Cotton Candy's single "Finale" conquers the charts
Attempts No.1 in music show

23:43.460 --> 23:44.690
Ae-rin!

23:45.670 --> 23:47.030
Where were you?

23:47.030 --> 23:48.710
I couldn't reach you.

23:50.060 --> 23:52.190
Why'd you turn off your phone?

23:52.230 --> 23:54.780
Sorry. I went to my parents' home for a bit.

23:56.120 --> 23:57.380
Come here. Let's eat.

23:57.380 --> 23:59.060
- Come on in.
- Come on.

23:59.960 --> 24:00.960
Ae-rin.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.170
Why do you look so down?

24:03.220 --> 24:04.420
Were you sick?

24:04.750 --> 24:05.890
Welcome, Ae-rin.

24:05.890 --> 24:07.870
Okay, let's have some

24:07.870 --> 24:09.100
- meat.
- Looks good.

24:09.100 --> 24:10.140
Let's eat.

24:10.630 --> 24:12.770
You can't drink.

24:12.770 --> 24:14.560
One person can have 100g of meat

24:14.560 --> 24:16.240
and 1/3 bowls of rice.

24:16.430 --> 24:18.630
Chew 50 times before you swallow.

24:19.010 --> 24:20.010
Also,

24:20.190 --> 24:22.080
Writer Seong said to send a photo.

24:22.110 --> 24:23.290
Jeez!

24:23.290 --> 24:24.750
Are you serious?

24:24.750 --> 24:26.690
- Okay.
- Then what will we do with all this?

24:26.690 --> 24:27.270
It's okay.

24:27.270 --> 24:28.630
I can eat it all.

24:28.890 --> 24:30.820
Let's eat. It'll go cold.

24:33.010 --> 24:35.410
- Looks good.
- You'll go up against KillA, right?

24:35.850 --> 24:37.740
They were No.1 this week.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.840
It doesn't matter if it's KillA or KillB. Bring it on.

24:47.370 --> 24:48.590
Since we're

24:50.470 --> 24:52.410
the crazy women of this area!

24:52.450 --> 24:53.160
Right?

24:53.160 --> 24:54.080
- Right!
- Right!

24:54.080 --> 24:56.280
You started this to disband.

24:56.280 --> 24:57.010
Am I right or wrong?

24:57.030 --> 24:58.330
- You're right.
- Right.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.290
No one can defeat people who risk everything.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.100
Am I right or wrong?

25:01.100 --> 25:03.160
- You're right.
- You're right.

25:03.170 --> 25:04.530
Okay, disband?

25:04.530 --> 25:06.460
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

25:07.560 --> 25:08.850
Drink, drink.

25:12.940 --> 25:14.640
The meat is burning. Let's eat.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.040
Yes?

25:34.680 --> 25:35.680
Jenna.

25:35.890 --> 25:37.050
Can I come in?

25:37.250 --> 25:38.250
Yes.

25:47.680 --> 25:48.680
I...

25:49.420 --> 25:51.100
I met Reporter Mo Ga-jin.

25:52.710 --> 25:57.860
Issue & 24 News
Reporter Mo Ga-jin

25:58.470 --> 26:00.040
I'm planning a series with the theme

26:00.040 --> 26:01.510
"Light and shadow of idol singers."

26:01.510 --> 26:04.250
You used to be a trainee, too, right?

26:04.250 --> 26:06.700
You didn't contact me because of that.

26:06.700 --> 26:09.690
You're not someone who writes about outsiders

26:09.690 --> 26:11.120
like me.

26:12.060 --> 26:13.540
You're right.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.000
Actually...

26:15.970 --> 26:18.560
I want to know about you and Cotton Candy.

26:18.560 --> 26:19.130
What?

26:19.130 --> 26:21.800
You met Hyun-ji at a dance competition.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.430
You became best friends.

26:23.430 --> 26:26.790
You were trainees at different agencies

26:26.930 --> 26:28.830
but Hyun-ji debuted

26:30.620 --> 26:33.000
and you didn't.

26:33.720 --> 26:34.720
Reporter Mo.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.890
You got it wrong.

26:38.130 --> 26:38.730
What?

26:38.730 --> 26:40.640
Hyun-ji became a trainee.

26:41.190 --> 26:43.190
I didn't even become that.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.650
When Hyun-ji dreamt of debuting,

26:46.030 --> 26:48.100
I dreamt of becoming a trainee.

26:48.900 --> 26:51.000
When Hyun-ji dreamt of getting popular,

26:51.000 --> 26:52.860
I still dreamt of becoming a trainee.

26:53.440 --> 26:54.640
Until recently,

26:55.820 --> 26:57.880
I dreamt of becoming a trainee.

27:02.520 --> 27:05.580
He asked about you, CEO Cha and Ji-han.

27:06.370 --> 27:08.940
He said he'll hook me up with an agency.

27:09.790 --> 27:11.070
I wanted to bite.

27:11.320 --> 27:12.190
Ae-rin...

27:12.190 --> 27:13.200
Jenna.

27:14.840 --> 27:17.280
I sometimes do jobs as an extra.

27:17.740 --> 27:18.820
Did you know?

27:20.020 --> 27:21.700
That even among extras,

27:21.800 --> 27:24.710
there's a lead, supporting role, and minor role.

27:24.710 --> 27:27.450
If you're shown next to the star, it's the lead.

27:27.450 --> 27:29.980
If you just pass by, you're a supporting role.

27:30.170 --> 27:31.290
If you filmed,

27:32.050 --> 27:33.620
but there's no trace of you,

27:33.820 --> 27:35.020
you're a minor role.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.110
I thought

27:38.110 --> 27:40.540
Hyun-ji and I were extras in this business.

27:41.590 --> 27:43.270
But Hyun-ji was the lead

27:43.450 --> 27:44.730
and I was always

27:46.470 --> 27:48.960
the supporting or minor role.

27:50.480 --> 27:51.330
Ae-rin...

27:51.330 --> 27:52.330
Jenna.

27:53.610 --> 27:56.340
The reason I thought Hyun-ji was the lead

27:57.530 --> 27:59.550
wasn't because she debuted.

28:03.340 --> 28:04.460
It was because

28:05.980 --> 28:07.660
Hyun-ji had partners.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.390
I envied her for that.

28:12.930 --> 28:14.610
When I was with Hyun-ji,

28:15.310 --> 28:17.630
I felt like I was a part of Cotton Candy.

28:18.510 --> 28:20.780
I wouldn't have made it if I was alone.

28:40.120 --> 28:41.120
Ae-rin.

28:42.810 --> 28:44.490
You're a part of us, too.

28:46.020 --> 28:47.140
You're family.

28:48.430 --> 28:49.710
We all feel

28:51.150 --> 28:52.750
grateful to you.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.200
When Cotton Candy disbands,

28:55.800 --> 28:57.240
I'll disband, too.

29:00.370 --> 29:01.370
Jenna.

29:02.420 --> 29:03.700
Please make No.1

29:04.130 --> 29:05.130
and disband

29:06.010 --> 29:07.010
fabulously.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.040
Then

29:10.110 --> 29:12.110
I'll fabulously throw out

29:12.350 --> 29:14.030
my old battered dream

29:14.840 --> 29:17.220
and dream a different dream.

29:22.310 --> 29:23.310
Okay.

29:27.370 --> 29:28.430
Du-ho.

29:29.420 --> 29:32.020
We made No.1 in the single chart today.

29:32.380 --> 29:35.090
I told you we're on a roll these days.

29:36.700 --> 29:38.430
Seeing we can do this now,

29:39.190 --> 29:41.790
I wish we could've done it when you were here.

29:43.990 --> 29:45.770
I'm sorry, Du-ho.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.140
You're not wearing a T-shirt with holes now, huh?

29:53.520 --> 29:55.820
Don't wear worn-out shoes either.

29:57.750 --> 29:59.840
Eat good food where you are

30:00.740 --> 30:02.420
and wear good clothes.

30:04.530 --> 30:07.640
That way, you'll have energy to make us No.1.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.800
We have to make No.1

30:12.380 --> 30:14.060
to get revenge for you

30:15.800 --> 30:18.390
and be a good granddaughter to my grandma.

30:19.410 --> 30:21.710
That way, the whole world will know

30:21.710 --> 30:23.980
that Oh Hyun-ji is something more.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.570
If we don't make No.1,

30:33.390 --> 30:35.530
you're so dead, you chubby fool.

30:56.350 --> 30:58.420
My Pretty Hyun-ji

31:03.800 --> 31:05.890
My Pretty Hyun-ji

31:17.500 --> 31:19.180
Hey! Come on out!

31:20.850 --> 31:21.670
Okay!

31:23.390 --> 31:24.270
What is it?

31:25.440 --> 31:26.320
Come on!

31:26.320 --> 31:27.320
Okay.

31:29.490 --> 31:30.490
What is it?

31:31.340 --> 31:32.340
Come sit.

31:33.220 --> 31:34.050
Jenna, come sit.

31:34.050 --> 31:35.390
I have something to show you.

31:35.630 --> 31:36.810
Okay.

31:37.370 --> 31:38.370
This was

31:38.700 --> 31:40.090
sent by grade school fans of yours.

31:40.090 --> 31:41.850
It's a video letter to root you on.

31:42.570 --> 31:43.930
I was really moved.

31:45.100 --> 31:47.530
I guess the kids have great writing skills.

31:47.530 --> 31:49.030
I'll play it for you.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.770
Even if it blooms on the mountain

32:00.770 --> 32:02.500
It's still a flower

32:02.590 --> 32:04.450
Even if it blooms in the field

32:04.450 --> 32:05.970
It's still a flower

32:06.160 --> 32:08.040
Even if it blooms on the street

32:08.040 --> 32:09.560
It's still a flower

32:09.820 --> 32:13.190
They're all flowers

32:13.460 --> 32:16.890
Wherever it blooms

32:17.040 --> 32:20.450
However it blooms

32:20.730 --> 32:24.250
Even if it blooms with no name

32:24.250 --> 32:27.660
They're all flowers

32:28.000 --> 32:31.490
Even if it blooms in spring, it's still a flower

32:31.680 --> 32:35.090
Even if it blooms in summer, it's still a flower

32:35.200 --> 32:38.660
Even if it blooms secretly, it's still a flower

32:38.970 --> 32:42.280
They're all flowers

32:42.550 --> 32:45.860
Wherever it blooms

32:46.210 --> 32:49.450
However it blooms

32:49.830 --> 32:53.070
Even if it blooms with no name

32:53.490 --> 32:56.630
They're all flowers

33:00.480 --> 33:03.990
I'm a failed idol singer!

33:06.230 --> 33:08.070
Even if it blooms on the mountain

33:08.070 --> 33:09.590
It's still a flower

33:09.850 --> 33:11.680
Even if it blooms in the field

33:11.680 --> 33:13.200
It's still a flower

33:13.500 --> 33:15.360
Even if it blooms on the street

33:15.360 --> 33:16.930
It's still a flower

33:17.120 --> 33:20.330
They're all flowers

33:20.690 --> 33:24.100
Wherever it blooms

33:24.380 --> 33:27.890
However it blooms

33:28.020 --> 33:31.450
Even if it blooms with no name

33:31.700 --> 33:33.590
They're all flowers

33:33.590 --> 33:36.650
Wherever it blooms

33:37.150 --> 33:39.020
However it blooms

33:40.770 --> 33:43.990
Even if it blooms with no name

33:44.360 --> 33:46.480
They're all flowers

33:46.480 --> 33:49.590
Wherever place it blooms

33:49.780 --> 33:53.050
However it blooms

33:53.470 --> 33:56.760
Even if it blooms with no name

33:57.020 --> 34:00.630
They're all flowers

34:03.290 --> 34:04.330
That's right.

34:05.790 --> 34:08.250
They're all flowers.

34:16.750 --> 34:17.710
What?

34:18.100 --> 34:19.650
Oh Hyun-ji isn't here?

34:21.120 --> 34:22.120
Hyun-ji...

34:22.889 --> 34:24.760
Went to get her grandmother.

34:24.949 --> 34:25.980
She hasn't come back.

34:25.980 --> 34:27.750
She was supposed to come last night.

34:28.290 --> 34:29.630
We thought she'd be here in the morning.

34:29.630 --> 34:30.710
Unbelievable.

34:30.710 --> 34:33.380
You should've told me this a lot sooner!

34:37.429 --> 34:39.739
There are no reports of accidents in that area.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.920
We don't know her grandmother's number.

34:42.920 --> 34:44.889
We're asking everyone to find out.

34:44.889 --> 34:46.909
If we can get ahold of the village head...

34:48.370 --> 34:49.250
Did you get in touch?

34:49.690 --> 34:50.690
What is it?

34:52.370 --> 34:54.050
Hyun-ji's grandmother

34:55.060 --> 34:56.190
is in a coma.

34:58.670 --> 34:59.790
Oh, no!

35:00.160 --> 35:01.490
Why so suddenly?

35:02.240 --> 35:03.570
Acute cerebral infarction.

35:04.990 --> 35:06.400
The day Hyun-ji went to get her,

35:06.930 --> 35:08.230
she collapsed.

35:09.820 --> 35:11.370
She hasn't woken up since.

35:12.840 --> 35:13.880
She was sick.

35:14.730 --> 35:16.880
That's why she kept hanging up on Hyun-ji,

35:16.880 --> 35:18.380
saying she was going to bed

35:19.100 --> 35:20.810
and canceling her visit here.

35:20.810 --> 35:22.210
She didn't want Hyun-ji to know.

35:23.150 --> 35:24.350
Poor Hyun-ji...

35:26.250 --> 35:27.630
What will we do

35:28.860 --> 35:30.060
about today's broadcast?

35:30.060 --> 35:31.670
I have to know the situation

35:31.670 --> 35:32.630
so I can make arrangements.

35:32.630 --> 35:33.830
I'll go to her.

35:34.190 --> 35:35.930
Prepare the fastest means of transportation.

35:35.930 --> 35:36.930
Yes, Sir.

35:40.070 --> 35:41.070
Sir!

35:44.190 --> 35:45.800
If she's in critical condition,

35:45.800 --> 35:46.800
Hyun-ji

35:47.760 --> 35:48.710
won't be coming.

35:48.710 --> 35:49.720
Okay.

35:49.720 --> 35:50.590
I'll get her to come...

35:50.590 --> 35:51.670
No.

35:52.190 --> 35:53.310
Don't do that.

35:55.370 --> 35:57.500
I'm saying this in case you do that.

35:58.640 --> 35:59.640
Kim Jenna.

36:00.670 --> 36:02.050
There's still time.

36:02.050 --> 36:03.310
We can decide

36:03.340 --> 36:05.340
after we assess the situation.

36:23.070 --> 36:24.330
Hyun-ji.

36:25.150 --> 36:26.880
Is it okay you being here?

36:27.060 --> 36:29.520
Everyone in Seoul is waiting for you.

36:30.670 --> 36:32.140
Shouldn't you go?

36:32.140 --> 36:33.420
If you keep crying like that,

36:33.420 --> 36:34.700
you'll die first

36:34.890 --> 36:35.710
before your grandma does.

36:35.710 --> 36:38.450
Who's going to die?

36:40.530 --> 36:43.050
I'll stay by her side.

36:43.340 --> 36:44.260
You go on ahead.

36:44.260 --> 36:46.240
I'm going to stay by her side.

36:46.510 --> 36:49.040
I'm going to stay by her side.

36:55.640 --> 36:57.780
Dry rehearsal is about to start.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.480
What will you do?

37:01.620 --> 37:02.620
For now,

37:03.000 --> 37:04.360
I think the four of us

37:05.290 --> 37:07.270
should do the rehearsal.

37:07.270 --> 37:09.240
What if Hyun-ji doesn't make it

37:11.100 --> 37:12.610
before the show starts?

37:14.350 --> 37:16.030
CEO Cha might bring her.

37:16.690 --> 37:17.690
This stage

37:18.520 --> 37:19.900
is Hyun-ji's dream.

37:20.880 --> 37:22.220
She won't come.

37:26.940 --> 37:29.340
She has trauma.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.200
When she was ten,

37:32.860 --> 37:35.200
she left her grandma who collapsed in the field.

37:37.740 --> 37:38.810
Grandma.

37:40.730 --> 37:42.210
I'm sorry.

37:42.320 --> 37:44.880
I'm sorry I left you that time.

37:46.360 --> 37:47.400
I didn't know

37:48.380 --> 37:51.470
you'd collapsed because you were sick.

37:52.130 --> 37:55.980
Like an idiot, I thought you fell asleep.

38:02.610 --> 38:03.610
No.

38:04.250 --> 38:06.430
Maybe I did know.

38:08.980 --> 38:09.980
Yeah.

38:10.890 --> 38:13.040
I would've probably left even if I knew.

38:14.790 --> 38:17.270
Because I wanted to go out and play.

38:17.270 --> 38:19.030
So I went crazy.

38:21.720 --> 38:25.220
You knew I left you that time, right?

38:27.380 --> 38:28.380
I know...

38:28.980 --> 38:33.580
You knew, but pretended that you didn't.

38:35.940 --> 38:39.010
I won't leave you twice.

38:41.150 --> 38:42.700
If I leave you now,

38:42.700 --> 38:46.200
you might not wake up ever again.

38:47.950 --> 38:49.040
Grandma.

38:49.630 --> 38:52.530
I won't leave unless you open your eyes.

38:53.360 --> 38:55.100
I won't go anywhere.

38:55.730 --> 38:57.040
You hear me?

38:58.280 --> 38:59.490
So...

38:59.800 --> 39:02.700
If you want to see me on TV,

39:04.120 --> 39:05.520
open your eyes.

39:06.670 --> 39:08.960
Open your eyes!

39:09.730 --> 39:11.440
Grandma!

39:22.930 --> 39:23.930
Grandma!

39:25.700 --> 39:27.430
You know "Arirang," right?

39:29.270 --> 39:31.400
I'll sing it for you.

39:31.870 --> 39:32.870
That time...

39:35.950 --> 39:37.220
Hyun-ji's grandmother

39:37.860 --> 39:39.270
almost died.

39:41.290 --> 39:43.560
Hyun-ji will never leave her.

39:48.770 --> 39:49.770
Then...

39:50.740 --> 39:53.490
Shouldn't you guys do the show without her?

39:53.690 --> 39:55.760
You worked so hard to get here.

39:56.690 --> 39:57.690
That's...

40:00.760 --> 40:02.010
Not our dream.

40:04.480 --> 40:06.570
It means nothing if it's just the four of us.

40:14.750 --> 40:16.610
What about your promise with your fans?

40:18.270 --> 40:19.310
This stage...

40:20.910 --> 40:23.570
It was also the dream of Cotton Candy's fans.

40:24.500 --> 40:26.360
We don't have to decide now.

40:27.510 --> 40:28.510
We should wait

40:29.560 --> 40:31.560
for CEO Cha's call.

40:44.010 --> 40:51.170
Over Arirang hill you go

40:53.070 --> 40:57.540
My love, you are...

40:59.130 --> 41:00.170
Leaving me...

41:07.950 --> 41:09.120
Grandma.

41:11.190 --> 41:12.280
Grandma.

41:13.420 --> 41:14.710
Can you hear me?

41:17.800 --> 41:20.890
You always asked me to sing "Arirang."

41:23.630 --> 41:26.980
I'll sing it for you every day now.

41:28.580 --> 41:30.460
Please open your eyes.

41:31.970 --> 41:34.570
Please wake up.

41:37.680 --> 41:39.640
If you're not here,

41:41.000 --> 41:42.600
my dancing

41:43.620 --> 41:44.620
and my dream

41:45.090 --> 41:46.880
are futile.

42:03.370 --> 42:04.370
Hello?

42:04.650 --> 42:05.650
Sir!

42:06.250 --> 42:07.930
Did you meet Hyun-ji?

42:08.110 --> 42:09.310
Is she alright?

42:10.140 --> 42:11.340
How is her grandmother?

42:11.340 --> 42:13.730
She hasn't eaten or slept in two days.

42:13.730 --> 42:16.330
She won't leave her grandmother's side.

42:16.760 --> 42:18.600
She looks really exhausted.

42:19.930 --> 42:20.930
I see.

42:21.760 --> 42:22.840
Jenna.

42:23.930 --> 42:25.110
Hyun-ji's grandmother...

42:25.890 --> 42:27.820
I promise you she'll wake up.

42:29.400 --> 42:32.300
We all hope for that.

42:40.550 --> 42:41.550
Hold on.

42:43.500 --> 42:46.810
Kim Jenna

42:50.670 --> 42:51.670
Jenna.

42:52.630 --> 42:53.990
It's me, Hyun-ji.

42:57.490 --> 42:58.660
Hyun-ji...

43:03.690 --> 43:05.220
Is everyone there?

43:05.710 --> 43:06.710
Yes.

43:07.240 --> 43:08.440
We're all here.

43:08.860 --> 43:10.540
Put me on speaker phone.

43:11.390 --> 43:12.390
Hold on.

43:19.320 --> 43:20.320
Hey.

43:21.910 --> 43:22.910
I can't go.

43:26.090 --> 43:28.560
I know we worked so hard to get here.

43:29.640 --> 43:32.840
It was a tough road trying to get on that stage.

43:35.020 --> 43:38.160
I know how hard it was for Jenna to lead us here.

43:41.140 --> 43:42.260
I know it all.

43:44.120 --> 43:46.650
I know this is everyone's dream.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.200
And we all have to be there

43:51.210 --> 43:53.340
for it to be meaningful.

43:54.560 --> 43:55.880
I know...

43:57.080 --> 43:58.290
I know...

44:01.000 --> 44:03.760
I know all this.

44:06.380 --> 44:08.020
But I can't go.

44:08.530 --> 44:11.650
I can't leave my grandma.

44:17.700 --> 44:19.380
I won't say I'm sorry.

44:52.970 --> 44:54.150
The four of us

44:55.550 --> 44:57.230
should go on stage.

45:00.960 --> 45:02.080
What use is it

45:02.800 --> 45:04.340
if it's just us?

45:05.580 --> 45:06.860
For Hyun-ji,

45:08.090 --> 45:09.270
we have to do it.

45:18.950 --> 45:21.080
How much time do we have till the rehearsal?

45:21.080 --> 45:22.200
About an hour.

45:25.990 --> 45:27.610
Let's rearrange the formation

45:27.610 --> 45:29.120
to fill Hyun-ji's place.

45:47.020 --> 45:47.830
It's okay.

46:52.830 --> 46:53.830
Oh Hyun-ji!

46:54.570 --> 46:55.570
Oh Hyun-ji!

47:01.670 --> 47:02.670
Grandma!

47:03.140 --> 47:04.140
Grandma!

47:04.210 --> 47:06.300
Are you awake? Huh?

47:06.620 --> 47:09.110
Open your eyes! Huh?

47:09.200 --> 47:10.400
Open your eyes!

47:10.560 --> 47:12.070
It's me, Hyun-ji.

47:12.070 --> 47:14.290
Are you awake? Huh?

47:14.290 --> 47:15.640
- Grandma!
- Hyun-ji, move over for a second.

47:15.640 --> 47:16.640
- Are you awake?
- Come on!

47:16.640 --> 47:18.390
- I'll call the doctor.
- Grandma! Grandma!

47:18.730 --> 47:21.130
Grandma, are you awake? Grandma!

47:21.130 --> 47:29.640
- Hello, we're Unlady.
- Hello, we're Unlady.

47:40.580 --> 47:41.580
You did well.

47:42.730 --> 47:43.730
Good job.

47:44.310 --> 47:46.050
I'll tell the director Cotton Candy

47:46.050 --> 47:48.440
will go with just the four of you.

47:49.790 --> 47:50.640
Okay.

47:50.640 --> 47:52.470
The fans would've waited for the whole team.

47:52.470 --> 47:53.750
I'm sorry it had to be this way.

47:54.970 --> 47:56.650
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

48:01.080 --> 48:02.080
Yes, Sir?

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
Jenna...

48:05.310 --> 48:06.770
I'm on my way.

48:11.830 --> 48:13.330
Grandma told me to go.

48:13.330 --> 48:14.330
She woke up?

48:17.100 --> 48:18.020
No.

48:18.020 --> 48:21.290
You're awake, right?

48:21.630 --> 48:25.670
Open your eyes! Come on and open them!

48:26.570 --> 48:27.690
Go...

48:28.040 --> 48:29.600
Huh?

48:30.400 --> 48:32.390
Huh? What?

48:33.240 --> 48:35.170
Go...

48:36.090 --> 48:37.860
Grandma... Grandma!

48:37.880 --> 48:40.010
Grandma, it's me Hyun-ji.

48:40.010 --> 48:41.620
Grandma! Grandma!

48:41.620 --> 48:43.330
Grandma, I love you.

48:43.330 --> 48:44.950
Grandma! Grandma!

48:44.950 --> 48:47.870
- Please step away.
- It's me, Hyun-ji.

48:47.920 --> 48:49.130
- Come on.
- Grandma!

48:49.130 --> 48:52.390
My grandma spoke.

48:52.390 --> 48:52.990
- Ma'am?
- Calm down.

48:52.990 --> 48:54.550
- Grandma!
- Calm down, Hyun-ji.

48:54.550 --> 48:56.650
Can you say your name, Ma'am?

48:56.650 --> 48:57.960
My grandma spoke.

48:57.960 --> 49:00.400
My grandma spoke, okay?

49:00.400 --> 49:01.520
Grandma!

49:02.460 --> 49:04.940
It's me, Hyun-ji. Grandma!

49:05.210 --> 49:06.280
Grandma...

49:06.330 --> 49:07.700
She hasn't gained consciousness yet.

49:07.760 --> 49:09.650
Please step out for a while to calm down.

49:09.650 --> 49:10.530
You're wrong!

49:10.530 --> 49:12.550
My grandma spoke!

49:12.570 --> 49:14.940
- Let's go.
- My grandma spoke!

49:14.950 --> 49:17.320
- My grandma spoke!
- Okay, okay.

49:17.320 --> 49:18.390
Grandma...

49:18.390 --> 49:20.260
She can't wake up.

49:21.160 --> 49:23.040
But she told me to go.

49:24.410 --> 49:25.850
She told me to go.

49:26.920 --> 49:27.920
Okay.

49:28.860 --> 49:29.860
Hurry here.

49:30.930 --> 49:31.930
Okay.

49:41.590 --> 49:42.630
She's coming.

49:50.910 --> 49:52.270
You'll be able to

49:52.450 --> 49:54.320
get on the train right away.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.560
Mr. Gyeong-tak, if something happens...

49:57.560 --> 49:58.560
Okay.

49:58.620 --> 49:59.930
If something happens,

49:59.930 --> 50:01.610
I'll call you right away.

50:01.720 --> 50:02.920
So don't worry.

50:05.020 --> 50:06.020
Okay.

51:00.010 --> 51:01.930
- Hyun-ji!
- Hyun-ji!

51:28.800 --> 51:30.620
Mr. Gyeong-tak

51:48.290 --> 51:49.290
Here.

51:57.600 --> 51:58.960
Mr. Gyeong-tak...

52:01.390 --> 52:02.770
Mr. Gyeong-tak!

52:02.940 --> 52:05.500
Why aren't you saying anything?

52:08.400 --> 52:09.980
Hyun-ji...

52:11.830 --> 52:12.830
Grandma?

52:15.180 --> 52:16.180
Grandma!

52:16.860 --> 52:18.110
Are you awake?

52:18.670 --> 52:20.220
Have you come to?

52:20.730 --> 52:22.400
It's me, Hyun-ji!

52:22.640 --> 52:23.640
Yeah.

52:24.600 --> 52:27.840
Will you be on TV?

52:28.620 --> 52:29.620
Wow.

52:30.680 --> 52:32.730
I'm proud of you, my baby.

52:38.490 --> 52:39.490
Hello?

52:40.070 --> 52:41.390
Hyun-ji!

52:41.670 --> 52:43.260
Your grandma is awake.

52:43.940 --> 52:46.480
She says not to worry and do what you do.

52:48.100 --> 52:49.300
Okay.

52:51.640 --> 52:52.640
Let's go.

52:53.910 --> 52:54.910
Jenna!

53:11.800 --> 53:14.300
Such explosive energy, firing up the fans!

53:14.300 --> 53:16.450
We just saw Unlady's performance.

53:16.450 --> 53:19.540
The poll for real-time voting will close soon.

53:19.540 --> 53:20.650
So please hurry.

53:20.650 --> 53:23.920
Now, we'll see the teams that'll be the finale.

53:23.920 --> 53:25.190
It's the No.1 candidates.

53:25.190 --> 53:27.920
First, it's KillA who's been No.1 for 3 weeks.

53:28.070 --> 53:30.690
Will they be able to keep their No.1 position?

53:30.690 --> 53:33.830
This is KillA's "Shalala," the next K-pop queens.

53:41.970 --> 53:44.280
At this perfect moment

53:44.280 --> 53:46.350
I encounter the real me

53:46.350 --> 53:48.210
Me, me (Me, me, me)

53:48.210 --> 53:50.270
Oh, me, me (Me, me, me)

53:50.270 --> 53:52.540
Don't be stuck in an obvious frame

53:52.630 --> 53:55.480
The star of this stage is me

53:55.480 --> 53:56.580
Me, me (Me, me, me)

53:56.580 --> 53:58.420
Oh, me, me (Me, me, me)

53:58.420 --> 54:00.750
I wanna dance the night away

54:00.750 --> 54:02.910
Just dance the night away

54:02.910 --> 54:05.130
The spotlight shines on me

54:05.130 --> 54:07.270
Ride the rhythm like bam bam bam

54:07.270 --> 54:11.370
The brighter the light, the more dazzling it is

54:11.370 --> 54:13.500
Wherever I go, I shine brightly

54:13.500 --> 54:15.090
Fly away Tinkerbell

54:15.090 --> 54:18.430
I'm fully prepared

54:19.240 --> 54:22.480
You know you can't reject me

54:22.660 --> 54:23.970
Baby love me now

54:23.970 --> 54:25.990
From my head to my toes

54:25.990 --> 54:27.870
I'm nothing like your expectations

54:27.870 --> 54:30.420
I can't be explained

54:30.460 --> 54:32.460
Everything about me is Shalala

54:36.490 --> 54:38.860
When the stars shine in the night sky

54:38.860 --> 54:40.500
Everything about me is Shalala

54:40.500 --> 54:42.720
Wow! KillA's performance is overwhelming.

54:42.720 --> 54:44.970
Cotton Candy is up next.

54:44.970 --> 54:46.480
KillA VS Cotton Candy.

54:46.620 --> 54:49.160
The real-time comment section is on fire.

54:49.160 --> 54:50.400
I'll ask my subscribers.

54:50.420 --> 54:52.080
Who do you think will win?

54:52.100 --> 54:53.360
This is so exciting!

54:53.630 --> 54:54.530
Hey, ya'll.

54:54.530 --> 54:56.470
Don't you think Cotton Candy will make No.1?

54:56.470 --> 54:58.090
The don't have an album score,

54:58.090 --> 55:00.800
but they have the united fandom.

55:02.770 --> 55:04.760
There will be voting via text...

55:04.760 --> 55:06.740
So there's the official fans, Candies.

55:06.740 --> 55:08.360
There's also Calla fans.

55:08.360 --> 55:11.170
And there are small and medium sized fanclubs.

55:11.380 --> 55:13.520
Tearful fanclubs because their stars disbanded.

55:13.520 --> 55:15.510
And fanclubs of ancestor idols in the 2000s.

55:15.510 --> 55:17.320
The united fanclubs have all gathered.

55:17.320 --> 55:18.350
What does this mean?

55:18.350 --> 55:20.000
That Cotton Candy's story

55:20.000 --> 55:22.210
sounds like my story!

55:22.980 --> 55:24.020
Cotton Candy!

55:24.190 --> 55:25.570
Let's be happy!

55:25.690 --> 55:26.890
Let's be happy!

55:27.180 --> 55:31.710
Cotton Candy! Cotton Candy!

55:32.050 --> 55:33.420
For the past 3 months...

55:34.090 --> 55:35.380
No regrets, right?

55:35.410 --> 55:36.770
- Right!
- Right!

55:37.810 --> 55:39.530
You did all you wanted to do, right?

55:39.530 --> 55:40.850
- Right!
- Right!

55:41.610 --> 55:44.060
Let's make it so that when we think of today

55:44.600 --> 55:46.340
in the future, we'll have no regrets.

55:46.340 --> 55:47.790
Okay.

55:48.340 --> 55:49.170
Okay.

55:49.220 --> 55:50.740
Let's pour out everything!

55:50.740 --> 55:52.270
- Everything!
- Everything!

55:54.440 --> 55:55.290
Ta-da!

55:55.300 --> 55:56.420
CEO Ma's ring.

55:56.960 --> 55:58.120
Me, too.

55:58.860 --> 56:00.060
CEO Ma...

56:07.490 --> 56:08.490
Cot!

56:10.380 --> 56:11.380
Ton!

56:12.280 --> 56:13.280
Can!

56:14.220 --> 56:15.220
Dy!

56:20.040 --> 56:21.160
Let's disband!

56:54.460 --> 56:56.210
Another candidate for No.1!

56:56.210 --> 56:57.750
They made No.1 on the single's chart and

56:57.750 --> 57:00.370
became a No.1 candidate in the music show.

57:00.480 --> 57:02.000
It's not just Korea.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.700
The whole universe roots for them.

57:04.700 --> 57:06.830
This is Cotton Candy's "Finale."

57:24.680 --> 57:26.640
Try me, What's wrong with me?

57:26.910 --> 57:29.120
You hate me, I'll show you who I am

57:29.200 --> 57:31.100
Baby, I gotta live it up

57:33.630 --> 57:35.700
Try me, What's wrong with me?

57:35.850 --> 57:38.020
You hate me, Now I've changed

57:38.560 --> 57:40.620
I love Cotton Candy.

57:40.970 --> 57:43.880
You'll be like cotton candy that gives

57:43.880 --> 57:47.170
comfort, happiness and love to the world.

57:48.620 --> 57:49.620
Look.

57:50.680 --> 57:52.420
I'm going to be like that.

57:52.710 --> 57:54.730
A star you can see anywhere in the world.

57:55.020 --> 57:56.320
I'm going to be like that star.

57:56.320 --> 57:57.360
No matter what.

57:59.050 --> 58:00.340
I want to get out.

58:01.220 --> 58:02.660
Whatever I become,

58:02.800 --> 58:04.930
I want to grow up outside this booth.

58:07.580 --> 58:09.180
I'm not unfortunate.

58:09.710 --> 58:10.710
I won't let

58:11.020 --> 58:12.460
my world be shaken

58:12.540 --> 58:13.980
by something else.

58:16.130 --> 58:17.130
Grandma!

58:17.680 --> 58:19.040
Are you watching?

58:19.400 --> 58:21.050
You're watching, right?

58:21.260 --> 58:22.860
I'm Oh Hyun-ji!

58:26.020 --> 58:27.320
To be a good agent

58:27.350 --> 58:29.030
for a successful Cotton Candy.

58:30.220 --> 58:31.500
That's my dream.

58:31.860 --> 58:32.860
So you all

58:33.010 --> 58:34.290
have to make it.

58:37.790 --> 58:38.790
Finally,

58:40.140 --> 58:41.140
it's over.

58:42.080 --> 58:43.080
We did well.

58:44.070 --> 58:45.090
All of us.

58:46.720 --> 58:47.960
We did so well.

58:49.860 --> 58:51.150
Good job.

58:52.660 --> 58:53.880
Cotton Candy.

59:00.920 --> 59:03.510
Can you feel this trembling?

59:03.510 --> 59:08.140
Do you feel the same way?

59:08.420 --> 59:12.950
Time has stopped as if I'm in a dream

59:14.280 --> 59:16.100
This is great!

59:17.640 --> 59:19.670
It's the ocean!

59:27.410 --> 59:29.640
Sir, shall we have an "Informal Chat Time?"

59:29.640 --> 59:31.320
That's no fun.

59:31.320 --> 59:31.750
Huh?

59:31.750 --> 59:33.710
Jae-hyuk, you talk too much.

59:35.280 --> 59:36.170
Why are you so stressed out?

59:36.170 --> 59:38.100
You guys are on a hiatus now.

59:38.610 --> 59:39.380
I'll enlist you in the army.

59:39.380 --> 59:40.580
- What?
- What?

59:57.580 --> 59:59.220
What are you going to do now?

1:00:03.680 --> 1:00:04.820
I don't know.

1:00:06.190 --> 1:00:07.590
What should I do first?

1:00:07.790 --> 1:00:10.340
I thought this was the only thing for me.

1:00:11.590 --> 1:00:13.270
But after letting it go,

1:00:13.940 --> 1:00:16.760
I see there's so much more I can do.

1:00:18.840 --> 1:00:20.610
There's so much more I want to do.

1:00:21.500 --> 1:00:23.790
You must be multi-talented.

1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:24.970
I envy you.

1:00:28.020 --> 1:00:29.510
Come on, Jenna!

1:00:29.820 --> 1:00:30.820
Okay!

1:00:34.490 --> 1:00:36.090
This place is great.

1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:38.030
You're free tomorrow, right?

1:00:38.030 --> 1:00:38.960
Let's go.

1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:39.960
Where?

1:00:40.470 --> 1:00:41.410
There?

1:00:41.410 --> 1:00:42.410
Yeah.

1:00:43.730 --> 1:00:45.910
Nobody will disrupt us now.

1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:48.720
Why do you keep asking me to go there?

1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:49.720
Remember you buried

1:00:50.930 --> 1:00:54.000
a time capsule under the quince tree?

1:00:54.240 --> 1:00:55.410
What was inside it?

1:00:55.410 --> 1:00:57.450
What? What did I bury?

1:00:57.450 --> 1:00:59.150
I saw you.

1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:01.390
You were startled to see me

1:01:01.390 --> 1:01:02.820
and hid it immediately.

1:01:03.020 --> 1:01:04.700
What did you put inside?

1:01:05.010 --> 1:01:06.010
Oh!

1:01:06.410 --> 1:01:08.210
Are you talking about that?

1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:09.920
What is it?

1:01:10.160 --> 1:01:11.630
Something we could open in 20 years?

1:01:11.630 --> 1:01:14.060
You talking about what Wendy asked me to do?

1:01:15.870 --> 1:01:16.540
Wendy?

1:01:16.540 --> 1:01:17.810
You don't know Wendy?

1:01:17.810 --> 1:01:19.290
She lived in our neighborhood.

1:01:19.290 --> 1:01:21.250
She was a tomboy.

1:01:21.250 --> 1:01:23.220
A redhead with a lot of freckles.

1:01:23.220 --> 1:01:25.230
She always braided her hair into pigtails.

1:01:25.230 --> 1:01:26.580
She was really strong.

1:01:26.580 --> 1:01:28.100
Oh, right.

1:01:28.360 --> 1:01:29.370
What about her?

1:01:29.370 --> 1:01:31.310
She liked you.

1:01:32.220 --> 1:01:34.900
She asked me to bury something in the yard.

1:01:34.900 --> 1:01:38.240
You know she was superstitious, right?

1:01:39.590 --> 1:01:42.000
She said she could marry you if I buried it.

1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:43.000
So?

1:01:43.460 --> 1:01:44.550
What did you bury?

1:01:44.570 --> 1:01:46.900
Her fingernail and toenail clippings.

1:01:46.900 --> 1:01:49.160
She even cut off pieces of her hair.

1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:51.120
That...

1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:52.580
That's buried

1:01:53.060 --> 1:01:54.550
in my grandparents' yard?

1:01:54.570 --> 1:01:55.570
Yeah.

1:01:57.420 --> 1:01:58.420
Jeez...

1:01:59.710 --> 1:02:00.720
Ji-han!

1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:01.600
Come on!

1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:02.960
Let's take a photo.

1:02:04.930 --> 1:02:06.460
Don't touch me.

1:02:09.070 --> 1:02:10.360
How disappointing.

1:02:10.360 --> 1:02:12.020
Sir! Come quick!

1:02:12.020 --> 1:02:12.730
Come on!

1:02:12.730 --> 1:02:13.990
Quickly!

1:02:14.340 --> 1:02:15.610
There's no time left!

1:02:15.610 --> 1:02:17.550
CEO Cha! CEO Cha!

1:02:17.550 --> 1:02:18.520
Let's do this.

1:02:18.520 --> 1:02:20.200
I'll take the photo now.

1:02:20.930 --> 1:02:21.930
We lost.

1:02:22.730 --> 1:02:24.250
But we didn't lose.

1:02:25.580 --> 1:02:27.020
We didn't make it.

1:02:27.590 --> 1:02:28.880
But we did make it.

1:02:29.720 --> 1:02:30.900
We failed.

1:02:31.620 --> 1:02:33.140
But we didn't fail.

1:02:34.860 --> 1:02:37.120
It was pitiful but also commendable.

1:02:37.940 --> 1:02:39.020
One!

1:02:39.220 --> 1:02:41.080
We loved as much as we hurt.

1:02:41.160 --> 1:02:42.270
Two!

1:02:42.870 --> 1:02:43.870
It was...

1:02:44.330 --> 1:02:45.330
Three!

1:02:45.540 --> 1:02:46.540
Our youth.

1:02:59.170 --> 1:03:00.470
The issue of disbanding...

1:03:00.470 --> 1:03:02.610
We respect Cotton Candy's wishes...

1:03:02.610 --> 1:03:03.610
Hello, Sir.

1:03:06.040 --> 1:03:06.940
Of course.

1:03:06.940 --> 1:03:08.670
The agency didn't make them.

1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:11.150
We tried to stop them from disbanding.

1:03:14.620 --> 1:03:17.290
Why couldn't they be no. 1?

1:03:17.290 --> 1:03:18.290
This is a mess.

1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:21.020
If they failed, they shouldn't disband.

1:03:21.020 --> 1:03:23.300
I didn't make them disband. Why blame me?

1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:27.530
Hi, Director Kim.

1:03:27.530 --> 1:03:29.030
How's the convenience store you opened?

1:03:29.030 --> 1:03:30.030
Profit's good?

1:03:30.350 --> 1:03:31.530
How much do I need?

1:03:31.530 --> 1:03:33.570
I want to buy a convenience store.

1:03:37.230 --> 1:03:38.230
Oh.

1:03:38.280 --> 1:03:39.280
Sit down.

1:03:42.310 --> 1:03:43.960
What do you want to talk about?

1:03:47.060 --> 1:03:48.500
What do you think?

1:03:48.610 --> 1:03:51.070
Cotton Candy disbanded,

1:03:51.070 --> 1:03:53.340
but the article value has gone up.

1:03:54.170 --> 1:03:55.900
I'm thinking about writing the article now.

1:03:55.900 --> 1:03:56.990
So go ahead.

1:03:57.590 --> 1:03:59.630
Write it. Why do you keep visiting me,

1:03:59.630 --> 1:04:01.440
giving me previews?

1:04:07.520 --> 1:04:08.650
CEO Cha.

1:04:09.030 --> 1:04:10.270
If you keep acting like that...

1:04:10.270 --> 1:04:11.630
Should I tell you

1:04:12.120 --> 1:04:13.620
why you're not writing it?

1:04:14.530 --> 1:04:17.130
You were never interested in the truth.

1:04:17.570 --> 1:04:19.190
You were going to use the photo

1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:21.400
to ask me for money.

1:04:22.050 --> 1:04:23.170
What was that word?

1:04:23.170 --> 1:04:24.170
Oh, right.

1:04:24.390 --> 1:04:25.060
Blackmail.

1:04:25.060 --> 1:04:25.940
Hey!

1:04:25.940 --> 1:04:28.840
I've been gathering information about you.

1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:31.330
You've been doing this a lot.

1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:35.050
You're a powerful reporter,

1:04:35.070 --> 1:04:36.610
so people kept quiet.

1:04:37.310 --> 1:04:38.670
But you're filth.

1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:43.100
And filth is bound to stink at some point.

1:04:45.890 --> 1:04:48.090
I'm recording everything you say.

1:04:48.100 --> 1:04:48.860
Okay?

1:04:48.860 --> 1:04:50.680
Threatening a reporter

1:04:50.680 --> 1:04:52.910
is challenging freedom of the press.

1:04:52.910 --> 1:04:54.050
You should know that.

1:04:54.050 --> 1:04:55.200
I also have a recording.

1:04:55.740 --> 1:04:56.740
What?

1:04:59.660 --> 1:05:00.940
Oh, good timing.

1:05:03.030 --> 1:05:05.740
I heard you receive money and write articles, too.

1:05:05.810 --> 1:05:07.810
The plagiarism exclusive last time.

1:05:08.580 --> 1:05:10.500
I heard Bbyong gave you money for it.

1:05:10.500 --> 1:05:11.720
What is he talking about?

1:05:12.180 --> 1:05:13.140
Oh.

1:05:13.680 --> 1:05:15.570
In case you took the money and didn't write,

1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:17.910
I recorded our conversation.

1:05:17.940 --> 1:05:19.250
- Sorry.
- Hey!

1:05:21.080 --> 1:05:23.750
Write fiction with the photo.

1:05:24.020 --> 1:05:26.330
Then we'll write a bill of indictment.

1:05:27.470 --> 1:05:28.860
What are you doing? Get out.

1:05:30.940 --> 1:05:32.720
Come on. Get out.

1:05:34.770 --> 1:05:35.770
Hey, mister.

1:05:36.140 --> 1:05:37.520
Get out.

1:05:38.170 --> 1:05:39.290
If you linger,

1:05:39.610 --> 1:05:41.280
you'll only prove you're a trash reporter.

1:05:42.820 --> 1:05:43.690
Get out.

1:05:43.690 --> 1:05:44.690
Let's go!

1:05:49.930 --> 1:05:50.930
Bye!

1:05:53.880 --> 1:05:56.050
I didn't help because I'm grateful

1:05:57.300 --> 1:05:59.290
that you dropped the charges.

1:06:00.370 --> 1:06:01.950
I did it to commemorate

1:06:03.480 --> 1:06:05.160
me coming to my senses.

1:06:11.340 --> 1:06:12.310
I wasn't

1:06:12.510 --> 1:06:14.190
that grateful, either.

1:06:15.650 --> 1:06:16.650
Okay.
