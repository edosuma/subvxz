- He's back.

13:30.680 --> 13:31.897
Great. Where is he?

13:32.120 --> 13:33.439
He's with Lucifer.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.427
LUCIFER: So I want you
to think about this.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.307
Your grandfather is God.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.821
Think about that.
Of all the powerful families in history.

13:44.920 --> 13:48.549
Forget the Tudors,Trumps, Jackson Five.

13:48.680 --> 13:50.307
We ’re numero uno.

13:50.480 --> 13:53.119
What's he like? God.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.781
DEAN: Hey, hey.

13:55.160 --> 13:58.220
I told you no talking.
And I told you no listening.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.821
Dean, he's in chains.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.138
His mouth isn't.
We should've gagged him.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.743
I need to know about my powers.
My family.

14:04.840 --> 14:07.502
Jack. We are your family.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.377
We've been protecting you.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.789
We've been honoring
your mother's wishes.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.503
We're your family.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.619
Jack, you have no idea
who Lucifer really is.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.779
And I never will unless I talk to him.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.383
- Jack.
- Dean!

14:23.000 --> 14:24.103
He's my father.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.520
MARY: (SIGHS) We should reach base camp
in a couple of hours.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.785
MAN: You know, you combine...

14:41.880 --> 14:43.063
DEAN: Sam, go back there and check out

14:43.160 --> 14:45.060
what Helter Skelter's saying
to the damn kid?

14:45.160 --> 14:46.343
SAM: Yeah.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.507
Take it easy on Jack.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.747
He's been fighting a war.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.982
He's trying so hard
to prove himself, but...

15:00.520 --> 15:03.182
He's lost people, friends.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.179
It's gonna take a minute
to get through it.

15:09.040 --> 15:12.385
I was just telling my dad
that now that he's here,

15:12.480 --> 15:14.664
we have enough power to kill Michael.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.903
Jack, that's not really the plan.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.097
But...

15:21.040 --> 15:22.428
This is our chance.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.380
Dean, like it or not,
Lucifer is Jack's father.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.266
He's going to take an interest in him.

15:29.480 --> 15:32.506
So what, we're supposed to just let
Lucifer drag him over to the dark side?

15:33.040 --> 15:35.224
Jack isn't going to the dark side.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.746
He'll see Lucifer's true nature.

15:39.120 --> 15:42.669
And he'll see it through his own eyes,
not yours.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.145
Hey, find him?

15:48.760 --> 15:49.897
No.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.427
Gabriel went ahead to scout him.
He should be back by now.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.839

15:57.600 --> 15:58.669

16:05.760 --> 16:07.421

16:20.640 --> 16:22.221
LUCIFER: Oh, yeah, about the cuffs.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.220
I knew they wouldn't hold me
in this world.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.623
Long story short,
I didn't want your impotence

16:27.720 --> 16:30.541
to get awkward, so I just went along.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.023
You're welcome, you're welcome.

16:36.880 --> 16:39.826

16:55.760 --> 16:57.387
Yeah, but it's no Sioux Falls.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.386
Why should it look like Sioux Falls?

16:59.720 --> 17:02.746
SAM: It's just our Bobby
back in our world. He, uh-

17:02.840 --> 17:05.627
_ He liked to freeze
his ass off every wmter?

17:05.840 --> 17:08.422
Yeah, well,
this Bobby's gonna pass on that.

17:08.520 --> 17:11.023
Anyhow, it's good to see you boys again.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.621
I knew you couldn't stay away.

17:13.560 --> 17:17.064
Yeah, you know where we can find
Charlie or Ketch?

17:17.320 --> 17:18.537
They ain't back yet.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.659
But we got a tip on an angel kill squad

17:20.760 --> 17:23.183
looking to execute some resistance.

17:23.280 --> 17:24.941
They want to head 'em off at the pass.

17:25.120 --> 17:26.860
You let Charlie go with Ketch?

17:26.960 --> 17:29.827
She let Ketch go with her.
It's her operation.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.459
Bobby, we're gonna have
to hit the road soon.

17:33.560 --> 17:34.697
We're running out of time.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.502
About that.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.160
Mary said you wanna take
a bunch of our people

17:39.240 --> 17:40.787
back to this other earth?

17:41.680 --> 17:43.307
Yeah, yeah. That's the idea.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.342
Well, no offense,

17:45.440 --> 17:47.943
but that may be
the dumbest frigging idea

17:48.040 --> 17:50.349
in a landfill of dumb ideas.

17:52.880 --> 17:56.384
So there's Michael, your other uncle.

17:57.520 --> 18:01.581
Sort of the studly-type.
You know, warrior-guy.

18:01.720 --> 18:04.746
I met Michael here. He tortured me.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.627
Same.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.540
We owe him one, right? High-five.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.341
Right here, yeah.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.142
That's your uncle Gabe.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.781
JACK: We sort of met.

18:16.520 --> 18:17.862
Let's go say hi.

18:20.480 --> 18:24.701
So the thing about Gabe, class clown.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.227
And you're an assclown.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.467
(LAUGHS) You hear that, he's such
a cut-up. I mean, I can't...

18:31.800 --> 18:34.382
Yeah, I guess your time with Asmodeus

18:34.480 --> 18:35.868
didn't do you any favors,
did it, brother?

18:35.960 --> 18:37.939
Well, my time with you was worse.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.506
- You recall-
- I recall nothing.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.346
I don't recall anything at all.
Happy endings.

18:42.440 --> 18:45.307
All good. Happy endings.
Uh, meet Gabriel, your uncle.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.387
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:48.640 --> 18:52.588
So I was just shaking up
the old family tree for young Jack here,

18:52.760 --> 18:54.864
you know,
talking about the good old days.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.384
How tough Pop was, right, G?

18:57.800 --> 18:59.700
I mean, we butted heads a lot, you know,

18:59.800 --> 19:03.941
but I think in hindsight
I should've given him some slack,

19:04.080 --> 19:06.139
because he's a... Being a dad is tough.

19:06.280 --> 19:09.420
Okay, you think dad was the bad guy,
and you were a victim?

19:09.680 --> 19:11.181
You are not a victim.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.341
That was just your excuse.

19:13.760 --> 19:16.342
- My excuse for what?
- For it all, Lucifer.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.097
For it all.

You want us to follow you
through a "magic door"

20:11.800 --> 20:13.700

the hell out of here

where everything's pretty?

what I was trying to say, that...

you don't know my sons,

20:24.200 --> 20:25.667

on our buddies.

Nobody's saying run out.

Guys,

20:35.760 --> 20:39.423
I don't know if you've noticed,
but you're losing, okay?

20:39.920 --> 20:42.104
You're out-manned, you're out-gunned.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.383

20:44.200 --> 20:46.543

on the biggest collection

of lore and weapons in our world.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.629
Now, something in there,
it might be enough to even the odds.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.142
DEAN: So we find that.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.105
Then you come back here with a plan.

21:00.200 --> 21:03.067
A plan to beat Michael and his armies

21:03.720 --> 21:04.823
and then you win.
