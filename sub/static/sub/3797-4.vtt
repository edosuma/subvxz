01:59.875 --> 02:01.333
Man:
Well, that should do it.

02:01.333 --> 02:03.791
Man ♪2:
Is that everything
there, Bill?

02:03.791 --> 02:05.958
Bill:
I think so.

02:05.958 --> 02:07.375
Man ♪2:
Great. Thanks so much.

02:07.375 --> 02:08.875
Bill:
I'll see you next summer.
Good-bye.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.916
( wind blowing )

02:49.916 --> 02:49.958
Clerk:
What are you doing?

02:50.916 --> 02:54.875
- I...
- He wants to see you.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.291
Go on.

03:01.041 --> 03:02.541
( knocks )

03:02.541 --> 03:03.791
Commodore:
Who's knocking?

03:03.791 --> 03:06.583
- The bellboy.
- Can't hear you.

03:06.583 --> 03:09.791
- The bellboy!
- Stop yelling
and come in.

03:11.708 --> 03:13.625
Did you do
something wrong?

03:13.625 --> 03:15.208
I don't think so.

03:15.208 --> 03:18.958
Then don't walk into a room
like a question mark.

03:18.958 --> 03:21.333
- Yes, sir.
- "Yes, sir."

03:21.333 --> 03:21.833
Look at this.

03:29.125 --> 03:32.291
What have we here?

03:32.291 --> 03:34.333
- That's Atlantic City.
- The city as it is?

03:34.333 --> 03:35.708
As you wish it to be.

03:35.708 --> 03:38.291
Hmm.

03:38.291 --> 03:41.916
Extend the boardwalk
south to Jackson.

03:41.916 --> 03:44.250
Raise it above
the surge line.

03:44.250 --> 03:47.708
Pave Atlantic Avenue.
Lay down trolley tracks.

03:49.541 --> 03:53.208
Coloreds stay here
north of Arctic.

03:53.208 --> 03:55.583
I bear them
no ill sentiment,

03:55.583 --> 03:57.500
but the races were
not meant to comingle.

03:57.500 --> 04:00.333
Trains and ferries.

04:00.333 --> 04:05.208
Trains and ferries...
this town dies without them.

04:05.208 --> 04:07.208
Get the capital in.

04:07.208 --> 04:09.208
But don't spend
your own money. Why?

04:09.208 --> 04:11.416
You could lose it all.

04:11.416 --> 04:14.041
Huh.

04:14.041 --> 04:17.708
You think you're
a smart boy?

04:19.208 --> 04:20.500
I don't know.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.791
You don't think
you're a smart boy?

04:22.791 --> 04:25.916
If I say yes,
you'll think I'm boasting.

04:25.916 --> 04:28.000
If I say no,
you'll think I'm lying.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.791
Don't try and parse me.
Just answer the question.

04:29.791 --> 04:32.791
Why aren't
you in school?

04:32.791 --> 04:34.500
Because I work here.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.125
No, you worked here.
For the summer.

04:37.125 --> 04:39.958
Summer is over.
I don't need you now.

04:39.958 --> 04:41.750
There's things
I can do.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.291
Such as?

04:43.291 --> 04:46.250
Sweep the sand away.

04:46.250 --> 04:47.958
I give the money
to my mother.

04:47.958 --> 04:50.375
How is that my concern?

04:53.333 --> 04:54.375
Are you gonna cry?

04:54.375 --> 04:56.708
No.

05:00.291 --> 05:02.333
Take that off.

05:02.333 --> 05:04.375
Leave it with Whiting
before you go.

05:14.166 --> 05:15.875
( thunder rumbles )

05:15.875 --> 05:16.875
( rain pattering )

05:19.916 --> 05:20.875
Margaret:
How do you do?

05:20.875 --> 05:24.125
Arquimedes:
How do you do?

05:24.125 --> 05:25.041
Margaret:
My name is...

05:25.041 --> 05:27.375
Arquimedes:
My name is...

05:27.375 --> 05:29.416
Margaret:
And then say your name.

05:29.416 --> 05:33.708
Arquimedes:
Arquimedes Cesar Plutarco
Gavilan y Ortiz.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.916
Margaret:
Perhaps something
a little shorter.

05:38.708 --> 05:40.791
Arquimedes:
Archie.

05:40.791 --> 05:43.166
I am pleased
to meet you, Archie.

05:43.166 --> 05:45.583
Also to meeting you.

05:45.583 --> 05:46.666
Margaret:
Very good.

05:46.666 --> 05:50.791
But the correct
way to say...

05:50.791 --> 05:51.541
What time is it?

05:51.541 --> 05:53.916
Nearly half eight.

05:53.916 --> 05:55.875
Why didn't
anyone wake me?

05:58.250 --> 05:59.708
They tried.

05:59.708 --> 06:02.583
I'm flying to Havana.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.458
Havana.

06:05.458 --> 06:07.875
Havana?

06:07.875 --> 06:12.541
The airplane
is canceled.

06:12.541 --> 06:14.458
It's lashing
down buckets.

06:15.958 --> 06:19.416
Call the airfield,
ask them...

06:20.625 --> 06:24.000
Have Sean come in and...

06:24.791 --> 06:28.791
Un minuto, por favor.

06:34.750 --> 06:38.958
I am pleased
to meet you.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.375
Did something happen
to the kids?

06:50.375 --> 06:54.916
Teddy graduates
from industrial school
next month.

06:54.916 --> 06:58.916
Emily won a prize
for an essay on
the Bill of Rights.

06:58.916 --> 07:00.916
Then don't take this
the wrong way,

07:00.916 --> 07:01.833
but why are you here?

07:01.833 --> 07:04.750
You'll like
your coffee first.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.791
Let's just get to it.

07:08.875 --> 07:12.291
For the past seven years,
I've worked at a brokerage
house in the city.

07:12.291 --> 07:14.625
A certain individual
opened an account there

07:14.625 --> 07:16.000
under the name
Abe Redstone.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.333
- His actual identity...
- Right.

07:20.458 --> 07:22.750
Yes.

07:24.750 --> 07:27.708
Ahem, he and I...

07:27.708 --> 07:28.541
Oh, no.

07:28.541 --> 07:31.750
Really? No.

07:31.750 --> 07:35.208
Not that.
Why does everyone
assume...

07:35.208 --> 07:37.791
I helped him with
stock information

07:37.791 --> 07:40.875
in exchange
for an apartment.

07:42.958 --> 07:44.000
How'd you come up
with that?

07:44.000 --> 07:47.375
I asked myself
what you would do.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.125
Nice place?

07:51.125 --> 07:51.875
It's nice enough.

07:54.916 --> 07:56.708
Okay.

07:56.708 --> 08:00.583
Mr. Rothstein is dead,
as you may be aware.

08:00.583 --> 08:03.125
My employer kept
the account open.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.958
He traded on it.

08:04.958 --> 08:06.791
I signed the orders
and he withdrew money

08:06.791 --> 08:09.750
until there was
nothing left.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.708
Last week he shot himself.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.625
The firm's
near bankruptcy.

08:13.625 --> 08:18.458
Carolyn Rothstein
knows you and I are
still married.

08:18.458 --> 08:21.791
She's demanding we pay
back the missing funds.

08:21.791 --> 08:24.958
If we don't, she intends
to sue us both

08:24.958 --> 08:27.625
and drag your name
through the papers and...

08:29.833 --> 08:31.833
that's more
or less it.

08:33.457 --> 08:35.666
I think I will have
some coffee.

08:36.625 --> 08:39.207
( music playing )

08:42.416 --> 08:43.957
Narrator:
Chicago, the Windy City,

08:43.957 --> 08:46.375
long home
to colorful citizens,

08:46.375 --> 08:48.166
but perhaps none
so blustery

08:48.166 --> 08:49.875
as the man called
public enemy number one.

08:49.875 --> 08:51.500
Man:
Hey, boss, looking good.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.083
( Al laughing )

08:57.125 --> 08:58.958
Narrator:
Beginning as
a two-bit bootlegger,

08:58.958 --> 09:01.291
Alphonse "Scarface" Capone
rose though the ranks

09:01.291 --> 09:04.541
of the Southside rackets
to become king of
the underworld.

09:04.541 --> 09:07.041
- Al: Two-bit, my ass, pally!
- ( Men laughing )

09:07.041 --> 09:09.875
Narrator:
From his palatial suite
at the Lexington Hotel,

09:09.875 --> 09:11.833
Capone rules his empire
with an iron fist...

09:11.833 --> 09:14.416
Ralph:
I'll say he does.

09:14.416 --> 09:16.625
Narrator:
...earning millions
while honest citizens

09:16.625 --> 09:18.458
- stand on bread lines.
- Here it comes!

09:18.458 --> 09:20.333
Right, look at this.

09:20.333 --> 09:23.125
Narrator:
Consolidating power through
a bloody reign of terror,

09:23.125 --> 09:25.666
Capone eliminated
all rivals.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.750
- Dean O'Banion.
- Bang!

09:27.750 --> 09:29.708
- Hymie Weiss.
- Bang!

09:29.708 --> 09:32.291
- The Bugs Moran gang.
- Bang, bang, bang!

09:32.291 --> 09:34.291
( laughs )

09:34.291 --> 09:36.375
Narrator:
Anyone foolish enough
to stand in his way

09:36.375 --> 09:39.166
paid the price
in blood.

09:41.250 --> 09:43.291
What do you think?
Fucking great, huh?

09:43.291 --> 09:45.708
- Go on, shut it off.
- Man: That's great, huh?

09:45.708 --> 09:47.916
- ( men agreeing )
- So?

09:47.916 --> 09:49.541
You're the Italian
Wallace Beery.

09:49.541 --> 09:52.625
( man laughing )

09:52.625 --> 09:54.125
( laughing )

09:54.125 --> 09:55.916
You think that's funny?

09:55.916 --> 09:58.083
What?

09:59.500 --> 10:02.208
- No.
- Then why you laughing?

10:02.208 --> 10:04.041
I'm not.

10:04.041 --> 10:06.500
I don't know.
I mean, everybody
else was.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.708
I'm not.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.250
You laughing, Ralph?

10:09.250 --> 10:12.416
Not me.

10:12.416 --> 10:14.916
( stammering )
Al, I'm sorry.

10:16.666 --> 10:19.291
Lay off.
He didn't do nothing.

10:21.125 --> 10:23.583
- Fuck Wallace Beery!
- ( Laughing )

10:23.583 --> 10:25.666
I'm the real
movie star!

10:25.666 --> 10:26.583
There ain't a kid in America
don't know my name.

10:26.583 --> 10:28.583
Or a cop, neither.

10:28.583 --> 10:32.916
Aw, Little Orphan Lucky.

10:32.916 --> 10:34.833
( men laughing )

10:34.833 --> 10:36.916
Aw, she's jealous.

10:38.958 --> 10:42.625
Charlie Luciano's
fuckin' jealous.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.333
I'm tired, Al.

10:44.333 --> 10:45.791
30 fucking hours
in a Pullman,

10:45.791 --> 10:47.166
he drags me
into a matinee.

10:47.166 --> 10:49.750
Get him a coffee.
Come on.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.250
- Let's watch it again.
- Twice is plenty, huh?

10:52.250 --> 10:54.458
I need a hot bath
and a nap.

10:54.458 --> 10:56.291
Fix him up, Mike.

10:56.291 --> 10:57.625
Right this way, sir.

10:57.625 --> 11:00.000
I'll see you later.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.125
Sorry I'm gonna
miss the cartoon.

11:05.125 --> 11:06.958
- I know you?
- No, sir, I don't
believe so.

11:12.416 --> 11:14.708
Run it again!

11:14.708 --> 11:16.833
( music playing )

11:19.416 --> 11:21.666
Narrator:
Chicago, the Windy City,

11:21.666 --> 11:23.458
long home
to colorful citizens,

11:23.458 --> 11:25.250
but perhaps none
so blustery

11:25.250 --> 11:27.000
as the man called
public enemy number one.

11:31.875 --> 11:35.041
( train whistle blowing )

11:37.583 --> 11:39.166
What are you doing?

11:39.166 --> 11:40.333
Burning ants.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.000
Don't do that.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.041
It's not hot enough anyhow.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.875
It's locked.

11:58.041 --> 11:59.875
Stay there.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.916
What's going on?

12:30.916 --> 12:32.458
Nothing.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.291
Let go!
( grunts )

12:39.416 --> 12:42.125
Stop.

12:42.125 --> 12:44.375
- Stop it!
I hate you!
- Stop.

12:44.375 --> 12:46.541
Eli, stop.
That's enough.

12:48.666 --> 12:52.125
That's enough.
That's enough.

12:52.125 --> 12:54.166
That's enough.

12:54.166 --> 12:56.000
Calm down.

13:04.208 --> 13:06.375
( panting )

13:14.458 --> 13:16.458
I'll buy you
a corn ball.

13:19.041 --> 13:21.083
Okay.

13:21.083 --> 13:23.416
Sally over phone:
You're not coming.

13:23.416 --> 13:26.708
- Did I say that?
- You were about to.

13:26.708 --> 13:28.583
No choice.

13:28.583 --> 13:29.833
I'm rained in.

13:29.833 --> 13:32.416
Well, what do
I tell Ronis?

13:32.416 --> 13:34.541
He's expecting
his good faith money.

13:34.541 --> 13:35.791
Oh, there are three words
that don't go together.

13:35.791 --> 13:38.583
Want me to hold him off?

13:38.583 --> 13:40.958
Is there a reason to?

13:40.958 --> 13:43.875
Some noise last night
in Oriente Province.

13:43.875 --> 13:45.000
The army's out.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.041
Does that affect us?

13:47.041 --> 13:48.875
I don't know.

13:51.208 --> 13:52.875
I'll wire it down now.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.250
Meet with Ronis.
Use your judgment.

13:55.250 --> 13:56.250
You had your coffee yet?

13:56.250 --> 13:59.291
Why is everybody
asking me that?

13:59.291 --> 14:01.000
You sound cranky.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.333
( Joe laughing )

14:03.333 --> 14:05.583
The toff holds on
tightly to his hat...

14:05.583 --> 14:07.625
I have to go.
Call me after the meeting.

14:07.625 --> 14:09.083
Sí, comandante.

14:09.083 --> 14:10.625
And what's that
supposed to mean?

14:10.625 --> 14:13.541
Oh, have your coffee.

14:13.541 --> 14:15.250
- Sally, make sure you...
- ( Line clicks )

14:15.250 --> 14:17.875
Margaret:
I know I'm not lost.

14:17.875 --> 14:20.333
( Joe laughing )
You've heard it before.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.458
- ( both laughing )
- ...beside him.

14:25.458 --> 14:26.750
( Irish accent )
There's himself now.

14:26.750 --> 14:30.208
Joe. You should have said
you were a comic.

14:30.208 --> 14:32.166
The club could use you
between the acts.

14:32.166 --> 14:35.250
His people
are County Wexford.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.916
I see.

14:37.916 --> 14:41.083
Won't cut the mustard
with a Kerry lass,
I'm afraid.

14:41.083 --> 14:44.041
I'm prepared to give you
the benefit of the doubt

14:44.041 --> 14:46.500
as long as you don't claim
the Ballyteigue Bay...

14:48.625 --> 14:50.958
That Ballyteigue Bay
is what?

14:52.458 --> 14:55.708
Very lovely.

14:55.708 --> 14:57.000
( laughing )

15:00.958 --> 15:03.791
He's a Yank.
What can you expect?

15:05.208 --> 15:06.791
- So...
- Right.

15:06.791 --> 15:09.125
What we discussed
last night.

15:09.125 --> 15:13.333
- Which part?
- The part I hope
you remember.

15:13.333 --> 15:16.125
I don't think
it's for me in the end.

15:16.125 --> 15:19.041
Why not,
if I might ask?

15:19.041 --> 15:23.375
Well, scotch and rum
don't really mix.

15:26.875 --> 15:29.250
You came around
to tell me that?

15:29.250 --> 15:32.333
Best not to leave
dangling threads.

15:32.333 --> 15:34.041
And I do wish you
smooth sailing.

15:34.041 --> 15:36.375
- I don't need it.
- I'm sure you don't,

15:36.375 --> 15:38.833
but a little luck of the Irish
never hurt anyone.

15:41.000 --> 15:41.708
New York, you said?

15:41.708 --> 15:44.791
Offer you a ride?

15:44.791 --> 15:47.791
- You have an automobile?
- Private train car.

15:47.791 --> 15:49.291
Two hours to Grand Central
high and dry.

15:49.291 --> 15:53.875
Laid in some fresh oysters
to keep us occupied.

15:55.875 --> 15:57.625
I should go.

15:57.625 --> 16:00.041
You just got here.

16:00.041 --> 16:02.833
It's the wrong time.

16:03.750 --> 16:06.083
I thought there
was a problem.

16:06.083 --> 16:08.458
Obviously
I'm mistaken.

16:11.625 --> 16:13.208
My husband would
like me to stay.

16:13.208 --> 16:15.458
Oh.

16:15.458 --> 16:17.625
You're the missus.

16:17.625 --> 16:20.458
( chuckles )
Well...

16:20.458 --> 16:22.916
that's the first sensible
thing I've heard him say.

16:25.583 --> 16:28.333
( speaks Gaelic )

16:28.333 --> 16:29.958
( speaks Gaelic )

16:35.208 --> 16:38.000
Remember, sport,

16:38.000 --> 16:38.833
safety in numbers.

16:42.791 --> 16:44.541
( thunder rumbles )

16:44.541 --> 16:46.666
( door opens, closes )

16:46.666 --> 16:49.125
( seagulls screeching )

16:50.833 --> 16:55.083
What grade am I
going to be in?

16:55.083 --> 16:56.583
Second.

16:59.083 --> 17:02.416
Will you help me
with it?

17:02.416 --> 17:05.540
You need to start
figuring out things
for yourself.

17:06.915 --> 17:08.665
Why?

17:09.583 --> 17:11.625
Where are you
going to be?

17:13.583 --> 17:15.500
Are you going somewhere?

17:17.333 --> 17:18.875
Nucky!

17:18.875 --> 17:22.333
You don't know
how people live.

17:23.790 --> 17:26.500
How else is there?

17:26.500 --> 17:30.291
They have houses
in Philadelphia,

17:30.291 --> 17:32.875
New York

17:32.875 --> 17:37.416
with paintings
and crystal glass
and carriages.

17:37.416 --> 17:40.208
They come here
with 10 starched shirts
and three pairs of shoes.

17:40.208 --> 17:43.291
A suit for the day
and a suit for the evening.

17:43.291 --> 17:44.875
And they don't
do anything.

17:44.875 --> 17:48.083
They lie in the sand
and they don't have
to do anything.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.541
Can't you see
what we look like?

17:51.666 --> 17:53.458
Can't you?

17:53.458 --> 17:55.375
- You're yelling.
- I'm not yelling.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.541
You're yelling like Pa.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.375
( sniffles )

18:05.375 --> 18:06.833
Can we go home now?

18:10.791 --> 18:13.416
( man speaking Spanish )

19:05.791 --> 19:08.666
Can I have the money now?

19:08.666 --> 19:10.875
Everything in the account.

19:12.416 --> 19:15.083
Of course.

19:15.083 --> 19:16.500
( coughs )

19:16.500 --> 19:19.166
- It awaits you as we speak.
- ( Knocking )

19:26.541 --> 19:29.000
( speaking Spanish )

19:32.750 --> 19:34.958
( clock ticking )

20:23.458 --> 20:25.458
Come on.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.166
Shut the door.

20:38.250 --> 20:40.916
This way.

20:54.000 --> 20:54.875
Ready?

21:05.625 --> 21:08.666
( thunder rumbling )

21:08.666 --> 21:10.625
Nucky:
I'm always getting
something wrong.

21:10.625 --> 21:12.250
I was in a restaurant
down there.

21:12.250 --> 21:15.208
I thought, all right,
trot out the lingo.

21:15.208 --> 21:16.583
So I asked,
"Do you have eggs?"

21:16.583 --> 21:19.583
Tiene huevos?

21:19.583 --> 21:22.125
The waiter goes,
"Oh, yes, señor.

21:22.125 --> 21:24.333
Two big ones."

21:27.416 --> 21:30.208
- You see, in Cuba, eggs...
- Yes, I understood.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.375
- What Chef Vola does...
- May I ask you a question?

21:34.375 --> 21:35.750
Of course.

21:35.750 --> 21:37.583
Why are you being nice?

21:37.583 --> 21:39.125
Why wouldn't I be?

21:39.125 --> 21:41.958
I can think of
all sorts of reasons.

21:41.958 --> 21:43.750
You come to me in need.
Anything else would be cruel.

21:43.750 --> 21:46.625
Is it because
of Mr. Kennedy?

21:46.625 --> 21:48.583
I'm not following you.

21:50.416 --> 21:52.083
I thought
you were inscrutable,

21:52.083 --> 21:54.833
but you are ridiculously
easy to figure out.

21:54.833 --> 21:57.166
I care if Joe Kennedy
offers you a ride?

21:57.166 --> 21:59.541
- Do you?
- Why would I?

21:59.541 --> 22:01.541
He's not holding
fresh oysters to my lips

22:01.541 --> 22:02.833
as we glide back
to New York.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.083
There's a picture
to contemplate.

22:07.083 --> 22:07.916
That's mine.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.125
Did you get a cut
of Rothstein's portfolio?

22:17.125 --> 22:18.750
No.

22:18.750 --> 22:20.541
That's pretty dumb.

22:20.541 --> 22:23.875
You're right,
I should have benefited
from a dead man's money.

22:23.875 --> 22:25.791
It wouldn't have
bothered him.

22:25.791 --> 22:28.083
Well, it would have,
but that's beside the point.

22:28.083 --> 22:30.208
You've got all the blame
and none of the benefits.

22:30.208 --> 22:33.791
Sorry to be
such a disappointment.

22:33.791 --> 22:35.458
What do you
expect me to do?

22:35.458 --> 22:37.375
Pay her, how much,
111,000?

22:37.375 --> 22:40.708
- It's what she wants.
- That's what she wants now.

22:40.708 --> 22:44.166
What happens later
when she sees how
easy it was?

22:44.166 --> 22:46.916
Wouldn't we both
rather keep this quiet?

22:46.916 --> 22:49.541
I'm not sure what
you're suggesting.

22:49.541 --> 22:51.291
I'm not suggesting
anything.

22:52.375 --> 22:55.416
I'm certainly not
suggesting that.

22:55.416 --> 22:57.041
Suggesting what?

22:57.041 --> 23:00.250
Whatever you think
I'm suggesting.

23:00.250 --> 23:02.916
Then why did you
even come here?

23:02.916 --> 23:05.041
Because you and I
have a problem.

23:06.125 --> 23:09.250
But only one of us
has a solution.

23:20.250 --> 23:21.000
Partners in crime.

23:24.625 --> 23:26.125
Charlie:
Paolo Vaccarelli.

23:26.125 --> 23:27.666
Al: Called himself
Paul Kelly.

23:27.666 --> 23:29.375
The beef he had
with Monk Eastman.

23:29.375 --> 23:30.958
- A boxing match.
- It's how they handled
things back then.

23:30.958 --> 23:34.458
I challenge you
to fisticuffs.

23:34.458 --> 23:36.666
That was the Bronx.
You were both too young.

23:36.666 --> 23:38.541
- Yeah, my dear sir.
- Paul Kelly.

23:38.541 --> 23:41.500
He's the one who
taught Johnny Torrio.
Old Five Points Gang.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.291
Johnny, you, and me.

23:43.291 --> 23:46.083
Johnny.
What's he up to?

23:46.083 --> 23:48.625
- Growing tomatoes?
- ( Al laughs ) Johnny.

23:48.625 --> 23:50.916
The only guy I know
would make an excuse

23:50.916 --> 23:52.041
to miss his own funeral.

23:52.041 --> 23:54.875
( imitating Torrio )
I can't go, kid.

23:54.875 --> 23:56.875
I got this neck thing.

23:56.875 --> 23:59.541
You take care of it.
( laughing )

24:04.666 --> 24:06.000
Here. It's for you.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.666
- Taste of home.
- Guzik: Is it a dildo?

24:08.666 --> 24:10.833
Charlie:
However he likes.
I won't judge.

24:10.833 --> 24:11.958
( men laugh )

24:18.041 --> 24:19.583
Charlie:
Empire State.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.208
( laughs )

24:21.208 --> 24:22.708
We got the Board
of Trade.

24:22.708 --> 24:25.250
This one
pokes up higher.

24:25.250 --> 24:28.250
My desk
next to the elephants.

24:28.250 --> 24:30.833
Al's desk
next to the elephants.

24:30.833 --> 24:32.541
On the desk
with the elephants.

24:32.541 --> 24:34.541
Desk, elephants.

24:34.541 --> 24:37.041
All right, we've been
down memory lane.

24:37.041 --> 24:39.375
Where you want to take
me to now, Charlie?

24:40.750 --> 24:42.875
Change is coming.
Maybe you heard.

24:42.875 --> 24:44.958
Heard you got
a new boss.

24:44.958 --> 24:47.666
What do you
want me to say?

24:47.666 --> 24:49.041
Surprise me.

24:52.541 --> 24:54.333
There's better ways
to do things.

24:54.333 --> 24:57.291
Like how?

24:57.291 --> 24:57.791
Run it like a business.

24:57.791 --> 25:00.833
( laughs )

25:00.833 --> 25:02.750
I already got
the biggest game going.

25:02.750 --> 25:04.375
It's not all about you.

25:04.375 --> 25:06.375
It's about all of us
together.

25:06.375 --> 25:07.833
Who's us?

25:09.208 --> 25:10.000
Italians.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.833
I don't know
no Italians.

25:11.833 --> 25:14.500
Napoletanos.
Calabrese.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.208
What are you again?

25:16.750 --> 25:18.750
Not important.

25:18.750 --> 25:19.875
'Cause that's what
your new boss wants.

25:19.875 --> 25:22.750
All pals.
His hand in my pocket.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.666
Go anywhere in the country,
New York, KC,

25:25.666 --> 25:27.708
Boston, Atlantic City,

25:27.708 --> 25:30.208
same understanding,
same rules.

25:30.208 --> 25:33.791
Nobody worries.
Everybody benefits.

25:33.791 --> 25:36.041
It's not less,
it's more.

25:39.083 --> 25:40.083
Atlantic City?

25:40.083 --> 25:43.083
Or Albuquerque.
The point is...

25:43.083 --> 25:46.333
Nucky Thompson's
not Italian.

25:46.333 --> 25:49.291
That's all gonna
get tidied up.

25:49.291 --> 25:51.083
Think about
where we come from.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.083
Think about
where we could go.

25:53.083 --> 25:55.875
10 years ago,
we were knocking around
doing whatever.

25:59.958 --> 26:01.500
What?

26:03.625 --> 26:07.625
The jaboney from before.

26:07.625 --> 26:10.500
- He jacked me once.
- What jaboney?

26:10.500 --> 26:11.958
Come here this morning.

26:11.958 --> 26:15.083
The cigar store Indian.
Atlantic City.

26:15.083 --> 26:17.083
Ralph:
Mueller?

26:17.083 --> 26:18.250
He's a fed.

26:18.250 --> 26:20.583
( laughs )
Pull the other one.

26:20.583 --> 26:22.375
He pinched me
back in '21.

26:22.375 --> 26:24.708
- With Jimmy Darmody.
- Whozit?

26:24.708 --> 26:26.666
The fucking jerk-off
Nucky Thompson iced.

26:26.666 --> 26:28.625
I got him
off Dean O'Banion.

26:28.625 --> 26:31.833
He was selling flowers.
Fucking steam irons.

26:31.833 --> 26:33.958
I don't give a shit
he sold ice cream
to Eskimos.

26:33.958 --> 26:36.583
It's him.
He's a fucking Prohee.

26:36.583 --> 26:38.625
Get him up here.

26:38.625 --> 26:40.125
He's making
his rounds, Al.

26:40.125 --> 26:42.625
I don't give a fuck.
Find him.

26:42.625 --> 26:44.666
I'll find him, Al.

26:44.666 --> 26:46.875
Where the fuck
is Mueller?

26:46.875 --> 26:48.541
- Where's Mueller?
- Find fucking Mueller?

26:48.541 --> 26:51.333
- Where's Mueller?
- Mueller! Mueller!

26:51.333 --> 26:52.916
- Where the fuck
is Mueller?
- Mueller!

26:54.708 --> 26:57.666
( Eli muffled )
Nucky. Nucky.

26:57.666 --> 26:59.791
Nucky!

27:02.541 --> 27:05.583
We did a bad thing.

27:07.750 --> 27:10.416
I'd put my pants on
in a hurry if I were you.

27:11.500 --> 27:15.208
Do you have any money?

27:15.208 --> 27:17.000
No.

27:18.666 --> 27:21.291
If you pay him,
he lets you go.

27:21.291 --> 27:22.750
But why?

27:22.750 --> 27:25.625
'Cause that's
how it works.

27:28.333 --> 27:30.625
I didn't want
a corn ball.

27:30.625 --> 27:33.083
I didn't want
to go anywhere.

27:37.833 --> 27:40.333
You know what
trespassing is?

27:40.333 --> 27:42.833
I work here.

27:42.833 --> 27:44.833
You don't work here
anymore, do you?

27:48.166 --> 27:50.750
What if you used
to work in a bank

27:50.750 --> 27:53.041
and I find you in
that bank at midnight?

27:53.041 --> 27:55.166
What's your excuse then?

27:55.166 --> 27:56.958
Hmm?

28:02.083 --> 28:03.708
Come on.

28:03.708 --> 28:05.000
( music playing )

28:10.250 --> 28:12.208
Nucky:
You should have your coffee.
You know how you get.

28:12.208 --> 28:13.541
Oh, shut up.

28:13.541 --> 28:16.416
I didn't mean that.

28:16.416 --> 28:18.583
Yes, I did.

28:18.583 --> 28:21.291
Oh, what are you
trying to do to me?

28:21.291 --> 28:22.333
You're the one who drank
a half a bottle of wine.

28:22.333 --> 28:24.750
So did you.

28:24.750 --> 28:27.166
You were drunk
when I arrived.

28:27.166 --> 28:28.875
You were hungover
this morning.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.791
And look at you now.

28:30.791 --> 28:32.333
What can I say?

28:32.333 --> 28:34.166
You always bring out
the best in me.

28:34.166 --> 28:35.625
( laughs )

28:35.625 --> 28:37.458
Least I can still
make you laugh.

28:37.458 --> 28:41.125
Do you know the worst thing
that ever happened to me?

28:41.125 --> 28:42.500
Let's not start.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.708
Do me the courtesy.

28:46.208 --> 28:48.041
What is the worst thing
that happened to you?

28:49.916 --> 28:52.541
Pro... hi... bition.

28:52.541 --> 28:54.666
I hear you, sister.

28:54.666 --> 28:56.916
Oh, please.
It made you rich.

28:56.916 --> 28:58.708
You think so?

28:58.708 --> 29:01.125
- Oh, you're broke, I suppose.
- Close to it.

29:01.125 --> 29:03.416
How is that possible?

29:05.083 --> 29:06.958
Ask your boss
on Wall Street.

29:06.958 --> 29:07.583
He might have a clue.

29:07.583 --> 29:09.958
That's not funny.

29:09.958 --> 29:11.791
Sorry to bring it up.

29:14.958 --> 29:18.541
You shook down
Arnold Rothstein.

29:18.541 --> 29:21.625
It was a mutually
beneficial arrangement.

29:21.625 --> 29:25.000
You held down a job.
You raised the kids.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.125
You did it by yourself.

29:27.833 --> 29:30.125
Was it by yourself?

29:30.125 --> 29:33.291
My sisters helped out.

29:33.291 --> 29:34.833
That's not what I meant.

29:36.416 --> 29:38.125
I'm still married,
aren't I?

29:38.125 --> 29:40.208
Blame your church
for that.

29:40.208 --> 29:42.583
I haven't been
in three years.

29:42.583 --> 29:44.041
And yourself?

29:45.958 --> 29:49.083
Married, too,
I suppose.

29:49.083 --> 29:52.083
That never seemed
to get in the way.

29:52.083 --> 29:53.833
You managed
to pay me back.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.625
Is this a fight?
I can't tell.

29:59.625 --> 30:03.333
We've had all the fights
we're going to have.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.250
What you said before...

30:30.250 --> 30:31.750
About what?

30:31.750 --> 30:33.833
That you had
the solution.

30:33.833 --> 30:34.916
What does that mean?

30:34.916 --> 30:37.791
What do you
want it to mean?

30:37.791 --> 30:40.666
You really are a bastard.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.375
Did I just say that?

30:44.375 --> 30:46.125
Yep.

30:49.500 --> 30:51.333
It stopped raining.

30:54.250 --> 30:55.625
( sighs )

30:55.625 --> 30:56.416
Darmody.

30:56.416 --> 30:59.208
Atlantic City.

30:59.208 --> 31:01.583
Came to his mother's
joint to pinch him.

31:01.583 --> 31:04.000
You and another guy.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.916
I don't know what
you're talking about.

31:05.916 --> 31:07.250
You ever been
to Atlantic City?

31:07.250 --> 31:09.500
I was once
for a trip.

31:09.500 --> 31:13.666
- What kind of trip?
- A religious retreat.
To Ocean City.

31:13.666 --> 31:15.250
We spent the day
on the boardwalk.

31:15.250 --> 31:16.708
Religious retreat?

31:16.708 --> 31:18.833
I bet you're
praying now.

31:18.833 --> 31:22.041
When'd you move
to Cicero?

31:22.041 --> 31:23.875
1922.

31:23.875 --> 31:26.125
- Mike: From where?
- Minnesota. Ortonville.

31:26.125 --> 31:30.166
We owned a wheat farm.
It went belly-up.

31:30.166 --> 31:31.916
How do you fuck up
a wheat farm?

31:31.916 --> 31:33.708
( laughs )

31:33.708 --> 31:36.125
Brown rust.
It rots the leaf.

31:43.416 --> 31:44.833
You think I'm stupid?

31:46.125 --> 31:48.916
No successful man
is stupid.

31:48.916 --> 31:50.708
Are you successful?

31:50.708 --> 31:52.166
- Not really.
- Why?

31:52.166 --> 31:56.500
I get the feeling
my boss doesn't like me.

31:56.500 --> 31:59.083
( laughing )

32:09.625 --> 32:12.416
See? We're all
friendly here.

32:13.791 --> 32:14.250
On your knees.

32:14.250 --> 32:16.625
What?

32:16.625 --> 32:18.541
On your knees.

32:18.541 --> 32:19.958
I ain't reaching up
that high.

32:22.500 --> 32:24.125
This is a mistake.

32:24.125 --> 32:25.916
Open your mouth.

32:25.916 --> 32:28.500
- I'm not...
- Open wide.

32:29.625 --> 32:30.875
There we go.

32:34.625 --> 32:37.958
Al, come on.
Here?

32:37.958 --> 32:39.666
What?
They got maid service.

32:39.666 --> 32:43.166
( Van Alden mumbling )

32:49.583 --> 32:51.041
You getting
any of this?

32:51.041 --> 32:53.875
Let him spill the beans.
I want to hear it.

32:56.708 --> 33:00.041
Ralph, count to 30.

33:00.041 --> 33:02.125
Aloud.

33:02.125 --> 33:04.875
One, two, three...

33:04.875 --> 33:07.458
- ( continues counting )
- Start.

33:07.458 --> 33:09.625
I've worked for you
for seven years.

33:09.625 --> 33:11.833
I broke heads in Cicero.

33:11.833 --> 33:13.583
I set up Dean O'Banion.

33:13.583 --> 33:15.166
I make my number
every week.

33:15.166 --> 33:17.958
Maybe I'm a federal agent.
Maybe I'm a bigamist.

33:17.958 --> 33:21.041
Maybe I'm a murderer
on the run.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.125
Believe what you want.
There's no way I can stop you.

33:23.125 --> 33:25.833
- But that's not
what matters now.
- It's not?

33:25.833 --> 33:29.000
What matters is this man
comes in from out of town...

33:29.000 --> 33:32.041
- 23...
- ...starts telling
Capone what to do

33:32.041 --> 33:34.500
about Capone's business
in Capone's house.

33:34.500 --> 33:37.291
- ...27, 28...
- And... and... and...

33:37.291 --> 33:40.416
29, 30.

33:40.416 --> 33:44.291
I'd say that's pretty
goddamn disrespectful.

33:59.958 --> 34:01.666
You can rule by fear

34:01.666 --> 34:04.625
or you can rule by love.

34:06.416 --> 34:08.833
Remember that
if you're ever in charge.

34:18.333 --> 34:20.000
Get him a drink.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
You've got a pair.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.041
What did I say?

34:35.041 --> 34:37.666
- You don't remember?
- I need a men's room.

34:37.666 --> 34:39.208
You gonna be sick?

34:39.208 --> 34:41.291
I may have soiled myself.

34:41.291 --> 34:43.791
( sighs )

34:45.666 --> 34:48.500
( men speaking Spanish )

34:51.000 --> 34:55.458
Miss Wheet.
I beg your forgiveness.

34:55.458 --> 34:58.625
There is no excuse
for keeping a lady waiting.

34:58.625 --> 35:01.208
Especially when she's
carrying this much cash.

35:02.583 --> 35:07.000
( speaking Spanish )

35:10.958 --> 35:11.875
Going somewhere?

35:11.875 --> 35:15.625
My wife.
Paris for the summer.

35:15.625 --> 35:18.000
I've never been.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.666
She gets restless here.

35:19.666 --> 35:21.500
And I get restless
when she gets restless.

35:21.500 --> 35:22.958
Maybe it's the other
way around.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.041
Do you wish
for a receipt?

35:28.041 --> 35:29.583
( chuckles )

35:33.958 --> 35:36.333
- You have a problem.
- I do?

35:36.333 --> 35:38.083
There's an uprising
in Gibara.

35:38.083 --> 35:39.666
They sent the army in.

35:39.666 --> 35:41.750
30 soldiers killed.

35:41.750 --> 35:44.041
Bombs and bayonets.
That must be messy.

35:44.041 --> 35:46.166
Gibara is very far
from Havana.

35:46.166 --> 35:48.041
But it's very close
to your cane fields.

35:48.041 --> 35:51.625
And now your wife
is off to Paris.

35:51.625 --> 35:53.458
I am staying here.

35:53.458 --> 35:55.375
For how long?

35:55.375 --> 35:57.166
Mr. Thompson
wants his rum.

35:57.166 --> 36:00.500
There is no rum
without the sugarcane.

36:00.500 --> 36:04.041
And there is no sugarcane
without the army.

36:04.041 --> 36:05.791
That is expensive.

36:05.791 --> 36:07.916
And that is what
the money is for.

36:09.625 --> 36:13.083
Plus ça change...

36:13.083 --> 36:15.041
I need to use your phone.

36:15.041 --> 36:17.208
It's long distance,

36:17.208 --> 36:18.708
but you can afford it.

36:18.708 --> 36:20.791
- ( music playing )
- ( Phone rings )

36:20.791 --> 36:23.291
Come on, a little
more with the whip.

36:23.291 --> 36:24.375
Beat me hard, honey.
Let's go.

36:24.375 --> 36:27.000
Old Rumpus.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.541
( Sally laughs )
You aren't so old,
honeydripper.

36:28.541 --> 36:31.791
Mmm, that voice.

36:31.791 --> 36:34.333
It's like a breeze
in the palms.

36:34.333 --> 36:35.875
Is your boss around?

36:35.875 --> 36:37.666
Conspicuous
by his absence.

36:37.666 --> 36:40.208
- You know that.
- Well, do me a favor.

36:40.208 --> 36:41.833
Tell him
the dirty deed is done.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.666
He can reach me
later at the bar.

36:43.666 --> 36:45.583
You really called
to talk to me, didn't you?

36:45.583 --> 36:48.791
Sally:
Well, of course I did, lover.
You caught me out.

36:48.791 --> 36:51.458
Mickey:
"Of all the words
of tongue and pen,

36:51.458 --> 36:54.916
the saddest are these,
'it might have been.'".

36:54.916 --> 36:57.125
Aren't you
the romantic?

36:57.125 --> 36:58.916
Such is my nature.

36:58.916 --> 37:01.666
I can't help it.
Where's the Cel-Ray?

37:03.666 --> 37:05.833
( men speaking Spanish )

37:25.125 --> 37:26.833
You sit here.
You sit there.

37:29.166 --> 37:31.041
Don't move.

37:31.041 --> 37:31.958
Don't touch anything.

37:34.833 --> 37:37.875
Don't kick
the furniture.

37:37.875 --> 37:39.833
( clock ticking )

37:46.875 --> 37:48.666
( whispering )
I lied.

37:48.666 --> 37:50.250
About what?

37:51.833 --> 37:55.208
I have a nickel.
I hid it in my shoe.

37:59.166 --> 38:01.583
Are we being kidnapped?

38:03.875 --> 38:06.000
You will scrub
your hands completely.

38:18.708 --> 38:20.166
Bless us, O Lord,
for these, Thy gifts,

38:20.166 --> 38:22.166
for which we are about
to receive from Thy bounty

38:22.166 --> 38:25.166
through Jesus Christ
our Lord. Amen.

38:25.166 --> 38:26.625
A bit rushed.

38:26.625 --> 38:28.125
Well, you looked hungry.

38:28.125 --> 38:29.750
I appreciate
your concern.

38:31.291 --> 38:32.375
Rebecca:
Guests first.

38:32.375 --> 38:34.250
Ruth:
I'll serve them, Paulina.

38:36.333 --> 38:38.083
Is there anything
you won't eat?

38:38.083 --> 38:39.666
I hate tongue.

38:39.666 --> 38:40.833
There isn't any.

38:48.583 --> 38:50.291
They say you run
the Corner Hotel.

38:50.291 --> 38:52.416
No, I just work there.

38:52.416 --> 38:54.583
Did work there
for the summer.

38:54.583 --> 38:56.625
This town
gets awful dull
come September.

38:56.625 --> 38:59.416
Don't start that.

38:59.416 --> 39:02.958
Much I have travelled
in realms of gold.

39:02.958 --> 39:05.333
And many goodly states
and kingdoms...

39:05.333 --> 39:06.875
- Learn another poem.
- Stout Cortez.

39:06.875 --> 39:09.291
- I am not.
- With eagle eyes.

39:09.291 --> 39:12.750
- Stop it.
- Ned, Ruth,
you'll love one another.

39:12.750 --> 39:15.625
Oh, we do, Mother.
We do.

39:17.208 --> 39:21.000
Have you entertained
my request, Mr. Lindsay?

39:21.000 --> 39:23.041
Sheriff best keeps out
of politics.

39:23.041 --> 39:26.333
It's not
a matter of politics,
but of family.

39:26.333 --> 39:27.541
What would you
have me do?

39:27.541 --> 39:29.208
Talk to the women
about such scenes

39:29.208 --> 39:30.958
as you've witnessed
in your duties.

39:30.958 --> 39:33.375
That's not a fit
conversation for any table,

39:33.375 --> 39:34.875
let alone amongst ladies.

39:34.875 --> 39:36.958
They know more than you
give them credit for.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.625
I expect that's true.

39:38.625 --> 39:41.625
Wouldn't your own
burden be easier if men
kept from drink?

39:41.625 --> 39:43.583
It's not my place to know.

39:43.583 --> 39:45.916
Talk to the women,
Mr. Lindsay.

39:45.916 --> 39:48.791
Won't you, please, Father?
They admire you so.

39:51.375 --> 39:53.583
I have been ganged up on.

39:56.250 --> 39:57.833
Thank you, Mr. Lindsay.

39:59.208 --> 40:00.916
You are welcome,
Mrs. Lindsay.

40:04.416 --> 40:08.416
Now then, I'm sure
our guests would like
a little more.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.583
( sniffling )

40:13.583 --> 40:15.750
I'm sorry.

40:17.833 --> 40:18.541
It's all right.

40:18.541 --> 40:21.875
It's all right now.

40:23.875 --> 40:26.208
Well, I heard
a corker today.

40:26.208 --> 40:27.625
What is it?

40:27.625 --> 40:30.208
Man says to the waiter,
"Now, see here.

40:30.208 --> 40:31.750
I've found a button
in my salad."

40:31.750 --> 40:33.500
"Oh, that's all right, sir.
It's part of the dressing."

40:33.500 --> 40:36.000
( all laughing )

40:43.958 --> 40:45.458
You all right there?

40:46.541 --> 40:48.291
Very well,
thank you.

40:51.416 --> 40:53.833
Why is the railing
so far away?

40:53.833 --> 40:56.625
Baby steps.
You can swing it.

41:04.666 --> 41:07.125
Nothing changes,
does it?

41:07.125 --> 41:09.333
Men to guard you.

41:09.333 --> 41:11.750
Plans within plans.

41:11.750 --> 41:14.916
Things you say
and things you don't.

41:14.916 --> 41:17.125
Maybe I've had my fill.

41:19.875 --> 41:21.000
What's brought that on?

41:26.583 --> 41:29.000
Things you can't say.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.875
You really want
to hear them?

41:33.625 --> 41:36.375
What is an "old rumpus"?

41:36.375 --> 41:39.125
Nucky:
It's a fearsome beast
with the paws of a lion,

41:39.125 --> 41:42.166
the belly of a Shriner,
and the expense account

41:42.166 --> 41:43.250
of a Westinghouse
executive.

41:43.250 --> 41:46.000
Do the women take
everything off?

41:48.333 --> 41:51.583
They have to leave
little pasties on their...

41:53.083 --> 41:54.250
Nipples?

41:54.250 --> 41:56.458
Yes, those.

41:56.458 --> 41:58.708
And do they kick
their legs up like this?

41:58.708 --> 42:00.416
More or less.

42:01.750 --> 42:03.125
You're blushing.

42:03.125 --> 42:05.083
I haven't blushed
in 40 years.

42:05.083 --> 42:05.875
You're blushing now.

42:05.875 --> 42:09.333
Who's watching the kids?

42:09.333 --> 42:11.166
Nuala will stop in,

42:11.166 --> 42:14.041
but they look after
themselves now.

42:14.041 --> 42:15.875
Did you bring
any pictures?

42:15.875 --> 42:18.250
I was going to,

42:18.250 --> 42:20.791
but I knew you'd suspect

42:20.791 --> 42:22.500
I was trying
to twist your arm
and you wouldn't like it,

42:22.500 --> 42:25.375
so I didn't.

42:25.375 --> 42:27.458
You think about me
that much?

42:27.458 --> 42:30.250
You left
a strong impression.

42:35.083 --> 42:38.125
When you came
to the suite that night

42:38.125 --> 42:39.791
after the temperance
meeting,

42:39.791 --> 42:42.958
I'd never seen anyone
who looked so lost.

42:42.958 --> 42:44.708
And I thought

42:44.708 --> 42:47.333
if I could save her,

42:47.333 --> 42:48.875
maybe I'm not
so bad myself.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.541
You did.

42:52.541 --> 42:55.416
Why lie about it now?

42:58.375 --> 43:02.125
I thought
the whole floor
of a hotel

43:02.125 --> 43:05.375
and he's the only one
that lives there.

43:05.375 --> 43:08.875
That must be
very lonely.

43:12.750 --> 43:15.750
Well, like you said,

43:15.750 --> 43:16.958
maybe nothing changes.

43:38.541 --> 43:39.833
Yes?

43:43.875 --> 43:46.750
Are you going to kill
Carolyn Rothstein?

43:46.750 --> 43:49.833
You have a very dark
turn of the mind.

43:49.833 --> 43:50.791
I didn't know this
about you.

43:50.791 --> 43:53.958
Then what
is this solution?

43:53.958 --> 43:57.041
She's going to take
25 cents on the dollar,

43:57.041 --> 43:58.750
your firm
will stay afloat,

43:58.750 --> 44:00.958
and this whole thing
gets buried.

44:00.958 --> 44:02.625
How are you going
to manage that?

44:02.625 --> 44:04.750
I'm not.
You are.

44:07.041 --> 44:10.583
You absolutely
are a bastard.

44:10.583 --> 44:12.000
Don't sell
yourself short.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.750
If you could put one over
on Arnold, you can do this.

44:14.750 --> 44:18.416
You're up to something.

44:18.416 --> 44:21.375
I'm helping my wife.
What's wrong with that?

44:25.250 --> 44:26.291
I should get
to the train.

44:26.291 --> 44:29.208
It's late.

44:29.208 --> 44:30.208
Leave in the morning.

44:30.208 --> 44:33.333
I don't have
anywhere to stay.

44:35.208 --> 44:36.875
Do I?

44:41.958 --> 44:44.000
Sean.

44:46.916 --> 44:49.791
Take Mrs. Thompson
to the Blenheim.

44:49.791 --> 44:52.166
A room with
an ocean view

44:52.166 --> 44:53.541
and a cab to the station
first thing.

44:53.541 --> 44:55.958
You got it, Nuck.

44:59.916 --> 45:01.875
I'm happy to see you.

45:10.166 --> 45:11.541
What are you up to?

45:22.083 --> 45:25.291
Frank:
Let it go, Mike.
Get some sleep.

45:25.291 --> 45:27.125
- What if he's right?
- Take the word
of a criminal?

45:27.125 --> 45:31.166
He saw
something, Frank.
It's real.

45:31.166 --> 45:34.041
Capone, the ledgers.
Stick with the plan.

45:39.166 --> 45:41.416
It's him.

45:42.416 --> 45:44.000
Frank:
Agent Nelson Van Alden.

45:50.916 --> 45:52.833
( laughing )
So that's it?

45:52.833 --> 45:54.958
You're here and gone?
Like a fart in a hurricane.

45:54.958 --> 45:56.791
( men laugh )

45:56.791 --> 45:59.833
Well, you know,
I'm not my own boss.

45:59.833 --> 46:02.458
Aw, poor little
Salvatore.

46:02.458 --> 46:04.333
( laughs )

46:04.333 --> 46:06.125
Now this,
I got to ask.

46:06.125 --> 46:08.583
I went to your barber.

46:08.583 --> 46:11.541
Oh, him.
I got to make another
appointment one day.

46:11.541 --> 46:13.708
( laughing )

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
- About our discussion.
- Yeah, sure.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.875
We'll see how
it plays out.

46:22.875 --> 46:24.500
Fair enough.

46:24.500 --> 46:26.500
Plant a seed, right?

46:34.708 --> 46:38.458
And the other thing.
I was way off.

46:38.458 --> 46:41.833
What, Mueller?
Nah, forget about it.

46:41.833 --> 46:44.375
Keeps us all
on our toes.

46:44.375 --> 46:46.708
No, I meant you.

46:46.708 --> 46:48.625
You're bigger than
Wallace Beery.

46:48.625 --> 46:50.958
( laughing )

46:55.333 --> 46:56.750
Boom!

46:56.750 --> 47:00.208
( laughs )
Come here.

47:00.208 --> 47:02.375
- Take care.
- You, too.

47:04.708 --> 47:06.500
I'll see youse
in the funnies.

47:19.500 --> 47:22.375
( spits )
Fucking pillow-biting
piece of Sicilian shit.

47:22.375 --> 47:25.000
Big shot, huh?

47:25.000 --> 47:28.625
Fucking Maranzano's
fucking messenger boy.
( snorting )

47:28.625 --> 47:30.333
Should have
tipped him a quarter.

47:30.333 --> 47:33.333
- ( all laughing )
- Guzik: Fucking balls,
right?

47:33.333 --> 47:34.500
- You need them?
- He's a fed.

47:34.500 --> 47:36.750
( all laughing )

47:36.750 --> 47:40.166
He's a fed.
He's a fed.

47:40.166 --> 47:42.000
Take me in.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.791
Oh, please, no.
Please help me,
little Rico.

47:44.791 --> 47:46.291
Help me, little Rico!

47:47.791 --> 47:50.458
He's a fucking jerk.

47:51.208 --> 47:53.500
What?

47:53.500 --> 47:54.875
What?

47:54.875 --> 47:57.083
What'd you call him?

47:57.083 --> 47:59.125
A jerk.

47:59.125 --> 48:02.458
That's a friend
you're talking about.

48:04.333 --> 48:06.583
Luciano?

48:06.583 --> 48:08.958
Since we were babies,
I know him.

48:12.416 --> 48:14.208
It was a joke.

48:14.208 --> 48:17.333
You like to make jokes.

48:17.333 --> 48:18.916
I like to laugh.

48:18.916 --> 48:20.041
Oh, you do, do you?

48:25.458 --> 48:27.458
Ah! It's too easy!
Too easy!

48:27.458 --> 48:29.833
( laughing )

48:32.833 --> 48:36.000
I got to make
some calls.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.958
- Clean this place up.
- Sure thing, Al.

48:37.958 --> 48:39.500
- Night, boys.
- Good night, boss.

( men speaking Spanish )

53:06.291 --> 53:07.958
Capitan,

53:07.958 --> 53:11.458
I am truly sorry we can't
seem to be friends.

53:11.458 --> 53:13.875
But I'm going to go
back to my car

53:13.875 --> 53:15.958
and stay
in Miramar tonight.

53:15.958 --> 53:18.875
( speaking Spanish )

53:34.125 --> 53:34.666
All I've ever done
in this world...

Hello?

54:24.583 --> 54:26.666
( static hissing )

54:26.666 --> 54:30.000
Sally?
Is that you?

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
Eli:
Sorry to disappoint you.

54:33.000 --> 54:33.875
Hold for Mr. Capone.

54:39.083 --> 54:40.666
Al:
We got a problem.

54:40.666 --> 54:43.291
His name is Charlie.

54:52.625 --> 54:53.875
Whoa. Whoa.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.333
Would you put
my father in jail?

55:23.333 --> 55:26.000
What for?

55:28.250 --> 55:29.958
He hurts my mother.

55:31.208 --> 55:33.291
I could.

55:33.291 --> 55:35.583
Sooner or later
I'd have to let him go.

55:35.583 --> 55:38.000
( train whistle blows )

55:39.541 --> 55:41.291
May...

55:43.333 --> 55:45.166
maybe it wouldn't
be jail.

55:45.166 --> 55:46.875
What would it be?

55:48.458 --> 55:49.750
The man in the hotel

55:49.750 --> 55:51.666
who asked for flowers.

55:51.666 --> 55:54.916
What you did with him.

55:57.375 --> 56:01.416
That was done
for the Commodore.

56:01.416 --> 56:04.000
And that has
its own rules.

56:04.000 --> 56:04.875
Understand?

56:07.458 --> 56:10.666
You don't be foolish.

56:10.666 --> 56:12.875
Enough trouble
in the world.

56:12.875 --> 56:16.458
Don't go where
you don't belong.

56:16.458 --> 56:18.500
Don't take
what isn't yours.

56:18.500 --> 56:19.583
Don't pass your burdens
on to others.

56:19.583 --> 56:23.583
Don't make me do my job.

56:23.583 --> 56:24.916
Because I will.

56:27.083 --> 56:28.250
Now...

56:28.250 --> 56:33.041
we are going in there,
the three of us.

56:33.041 --> 56:36.291
I'm gonna tell your father
you worked for me today.

56:36.291 --> 56:40.500
If he doesn't like it,
he's interfering
with the law

56:40.500 --> 56:42.416
and he will answer
for that.

56:42.416 --> 56:43.916
Agreed?

56:58.666 --> 57:02.333
Deputy Sheriff Thompson.
