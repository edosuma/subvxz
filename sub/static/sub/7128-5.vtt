WEBVTT

00:06.059 --> 00:08.026
Where the heck are they...

00:08.897 --> 00:11.397
The tomatoes, the lox, that
herb cream cheese i love?

00:12.262 --> 00:15.062
This is the bargain plate.
Deluxe is $18.75 extra.

00:15.072 --> 00:18.237
Charge it to the company
account. This is c.O.D., lady.

00:18.708 --> 00:21.441
Mr. Stone said some woman
named patti della-Something

00:21.451 --> 00:25.542
Would be here to pay for it.
Oh, i bet he did. Come on.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.846
Is there a problem, mr. Stone?

00:28.416 --> 00:31.416
It's just... i was just waiting
for everyone to get here, so...

00:33.348 --> 00:34.014
This is everyone, eli.

00:36.221 --> 00:37.554
Right, okay.

00:38.922 --> 00:41.388
So... client retention.
Taylor, keith, any updates?

00:42.395 --> 00:43.695
You've been pursuing latham.

00:43.862 --> 00:46.529
Good news on latham,
people. I'm happy to report

00:46.539 --> 00:49.732
They're now part of the
posner-Klein family. All right!

00:50.505 --> 00:52.205
What's the score, woo?

00:54.271 --> 00:57.204
Wethersby, stone & associates
5, posner-Klein... 86.

00:57.913 --> 01:01.113
Yeah! This isn't a numbers game.

01:01.513 --> 01:04.146
All we need to keep us
afloat is one big fish.

01:04.156 --> 01:07.618
I think jim cooper is that fish.
Just got a call from jim cooper.

01:08.255 --> 01:10.555
Rns out our donations
to his m.S. Foundation

01:10.823 --> 01:13.323
And the local arts
council blew him away.

01:13.333 --> 01:16.628
He'sveryinterested in making
the move. It's not fair.

01:16.638 --> 01:21.161
It's like they know what we're gonna do before
we do it. He's right. They win every time.

01:21.303 --> 01:25.003
Yeah. Posner-Klein is comprised
of our former colleagues.

01:25.437 --> 01:27.737
Some cross-Pollination
in terms of strategy

01:28.575 --> 01:30.608
Is bound to occur. Let's not overreact.

01:32.479 --> 01:33.312
It is a little suspicious

01:33.322 --> 01:35.316
How p&k keep beating us to the punch.

01:36.384 --> 01:37.317
I pitched latham on tuesday.

01:37.327 --> 01:39.951
An hour later, they signed
with p&k... exact same terms.

01:40.154 --> 01:43.121
Same thing happened after my
meetings with fuller and valdez.

01:43.131 --> 01:47.694
Let's not be paranoid. No one's trying to
sabotage us. , because they're actually doing it.

01:47.704 --> 01:49.762
As you pointed out,
sir, some of our people

01:50.698 --> 01:52.664
Are in contact with their people,

01:52.674 --> 01:55.367
So some cross-Pollination is bound to occur.
I'm not pollinating anything with matt.

01:55.838 --> 01:58.338
I didn't say you were. I
was just trying to imply

01:58.348 --> 02:02.640
That you were pillow-Talking our business plan
with him. I am not the leak, eli, and to prove it,

02:02.650 --> 02:05.375
I'm gonna find out who
is. Happy? Ecstatic.

02:05.813 --> 02:07.980
Your management skills
are as deft as ever.

02:07.990 --> 02:10.978
Speaking of which, i'm not
sure it's good for office morale

02:11.682 --> 02:13.049
Or your own, for that matter,

02:13.059 --> 02:15.854
To pin all our hopes on a single ient. He's
the greatest humanitarian of his generation.

02:15.858 --> 02:18.624
We land cooper, everyone's
morale is gonna skyrocket.

02:18.634 --> 02:20.959
Cooper is trying to
grow his own marijuana

02:21.730 --> 02:24.463
For a clinical trial which
might cure his son's m.S.

02:24.473 --> 02:28.164
I mean, it's signature wethersby-Stone. We're
a new firm, eli. We don't yet have a signature,

02:28.669 --> 02:30.469
Which is why i think we should aim

02:30.479 --> 02:33.505
To diversify our client base. We win the
cooper case, those other guys still on the fence

02:33.515 --> 02:36.141
Are gonna be ling up outside
our door. That's a very big "if."

02:36.243 --> 02:38.543
Maybe so, but it's one of the few plays

02:40.176 --> 02:41.009
We have left in our deck.

02:43.181 --> 02:43.748
Oh. Oh, goodness.

02:43.758 --> 02:47.587
What took you so long? Was the records
room backed up? Iamthe records room.

02:47.597 --> 02:50.089
Oh, where are you going?
No, no. I need your help

02:50.099 --> 02:52.691
To go through all these
files. I gotta figure out a way

02:52.793 --> 02:54.693
To get access to this jim cooper

02:54.703 --> 02:57.196
Before posner & klein close
in on him. You mean stalk.

02:57.395 --> 03:00.229
Yes, and your brimming
optimism is duly noted.

03:00.239 --> 03:04.235
Well, optimism was maggie's
department. Well, she's gone, so...

03:05.640 --> 03:08.340
Look at this picture of him
in the paper with his son.

03:08.510 --> 03:12.877
What's it say? Well, apparently, last
month jim jr. Set a new state record

03:13.448 --> 03:15.948
For the 200 freestyle. I
thought you said he had m.S.

03:15.950 --> 03:17.950
It's in remission.

03:18.053 --> 03:20.586
Find out where and when
his next swim meet is

03:23.155 --> 03:24.688
And then get jordan. Okay.

03:27.161 --> 03:27.328
Whoa.

03:28.828 --> 03:29.194
Whoa! What?

03:37.002 --> 03:37.102
Oh!

03:38.402 --> 03:39.136
You are just a vision,

03:43.210 --> 03:45.644
'Cause things do not
spontaneously burst into flames.

03:47.382 --> 03:49.815
Okay, i am 99.9% sure
that you are a vision.

03:56.584 --> 03:57.217
But just in case...

03:58.692 --> 03:59.892
What are you doing?

04:01.593 --> 04:02.093
Just... just...

04:09.366 --> 04:10.166
I'm sorry. I was just...

04:10.236 --> 04:12.336
All right!

04:13.638 --> 04:15.638
Yes! Way to go, j.! Whoo!

04:16.841 --> 04:18.675
That's what i'm talkin' about! Whoo!

04:19.077 --> 04:21.277
Mr. Cooper, i don't
know if you rember me.

04:22.079 --> 04:22.746
My name's eli stone.

04:23.918 --> 04:26.151
Jordan. I didn't peg
you for a swim junkie.

04:26.161 --> 04:29.154
Jim, i know showing up like
this is unorthodox, but, uh...

04:29.164 --> 04:31.757
We think that we can help
you with your clinical trial

04:31.767 --> 04:35.157
If you'll just hear us out. Well, j.'S
swimming his next event in ten minutes.

04:35.167 --> 04:38.797
I'll give you three. Okay. Well, we
know that you applied to the d.E.A

04:38.807 --> 04:40.799
For a license to grow
your own marijuana,

04:40.809 --> 04:44.101
And we know that your application
was rejected. So you know my case.

04:44.111 --> 04:47.669
What i'm more interested in is
a strategy for winning. Right.

04:49.877 --> 04:51.543
Hey, kiddo, you looked great out there.

04:51.553 --> 04:54.979
We caught your race on the way
in. You got a real gift. Thanks.

04:54.983 --> 04:57.883
Hoping i qualify for olympic
pretrials if i can keep it up.

04:57.893 --> 04:59.885
I know that we look like two suits

04:59.895 --> 05:02.054
Trying to schmooze your
dad, and to be fair, we are.

05:02.624 --> 05:04.990
But we're also here to help him give you

05:05.000 --> 05:08.058
The best shot at a cure. I better
not monopolize your time then.

05:08.325 --> 05:10.992
Just make sure he doesn't
miss me smashing my best time

05:11.002 --> 05:14.366
In the 100 free. Oh, are you
kidding? I don't want to miss that.

05:14.376 --> 05:17.035
He's a smart kid. "Monopolize"
is a good s.A.T. Word.

05:17.045 --> 05:19.004
It's also, ironically, our strategy.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.540
The federal government
controls the entire supply

05:22.776 --> 05:25.343
Of medical marijuana
used for f.D.A. Trials.

05:25.379 --> 05:27.512
That's a de facto illegal monopoly.

05:27.748 --> 05:30.248
We argue to the d.E.A.
That denying you a license

05:30.258 --> 05:32.582
To grow pot is anticapitalist,
stifles competition

05:32.846 --> 05:34.513
And isn't in the public interest.

05:41.625 --> 05:42.325
Well, i'll be damned.

05:48.300 --> 05:49.134
Yes!

05:50.635 --> 05:53.402
Posner & klein can kiss my
$100-Grand-A-Week retainedass!

05:53.608 --> 05:56.274
Whoa! That's how we do
things downtown! Sorry.

05:56.284 --> 05:59.243
Quite all right. If i were more
prone to outbursts of emotion,

05:59.253 --> 06:01.108
I'd probably be doing a little jig.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.148
That i would pay real money to see.

06:10.921 --> 06:11.688
Uptown got its hustlers

06:13.458 --> 06:14.958
Uptown's got its hustlers

06:16.995 --> 06:17.762
The bowery got its bums

06:19.630 --> 06:21.330
The bowery's got s bums

06:22.567 --> 06:24.067
42nd street got big jim walker

06:24.804 --> 06:26.838
He's a pool-Shootin' son of a gun

06:28.973 --> 06:29.073
Ooh

06:31.942 --> 06:32.209
Ooh, ooh

06:34.247 --> 06:36.147
42nd street's got big jim walker

06:37.547 --> 06:38.014
Big jim walker

06:39.750 --> 06:42.017
Yeah, he's big and
dumb as a man can come

06:42.027 --> 06:44.655
But stronger than a
country horse country horse

06:44.722 --> 06:47.056
And when the bad folks
all get together at night

06:48.125 --> 06:50.059
You know they all
call him big jim "boss"

06:54.932 --> 06:55.332
Just because

06:56.568 --> 06:58.801
They say you don't
tug on superman's cape

07:00.371 --> 07:02.038
You don't spit into the wind

07:02.941 --> 07:05.307
You don't pull the mask
off that old lone ranger

07:06.846 --> 07:08.546
And you don't mess around with jim

07:10.181 --> 07:10.381
Ooh, h

07:11.747 --> 07:11.880
Yeah

07:11.984 --> 07:13.617
You don't tug on superman's cape

07:13.627 --> 07:16.553
Tug on it you don't spit into the wind

07:16.563 --> 07:20.390
Into the wind you don't pull
the mask off that old lone ranger

07:24.164 --> 07:26.398
And you don't mess around with jim

07:27.699 --> 07:28.466
Savor this moment, eli.

07:32.039 --> 07:34.939
Catching your first big
fish... nothing quite like it.

07:47.565 --> 07:51.299
Where do you think you're
going? Um, to my office.

07:52.135 --> 07:53.669
Why not to the conference room?

07:53.679 --> 07:57.373
Is there something going on in the conference
room? I need your help. It's my daughter angela.

07:57.573 --> 07:59.873
She got pulled over for
a d.U.I. Two days ago.

08:00.845 --> 08:01.511
What... what happened?

08:01.521 --> 08:03.846
Nothing, really. She was
at a bachelorette party.

08:04.215 --> 08:06.449
She hadaglass of wine. That's it.

08:06.459 --> 08:09.349
She didn't do anything wrong.
Did they give her a breathalyzer?

08:09.359 --> 08:11.686
What did she blow? How should
i know? That's your job.

08:11.696 --> 08:16.157
Is eli busy or somethin'? I thoughtyouwere
the hotshot criminal defense lawyer.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.493
Well, that's flattering,
but i think it's best

08:18.662 --> 08:21.062
If we go with someone
outside the office with this.

08:21.072 --> 08:25.864
So, uh, i'll give my old colleague danny meyer a
call. And this danny character... where does he live?

08:25.874 --> 08:29.039
I don't know. What's the matter?
I need to know i can track him down

08:29.049 --> 08:33.208
And kick him in the cojones if he messes this up.
And that's why i'm not the guy to help you with this.

08:33.219 --> 08:35.212
What's worse... you going
to your grave knowing that

08:35.222 --> 08:37.546
You let my daughter... a woman
who's never gotten so much

08:37.649 --> 08:40.082
As a parking ticket...
lose her financial aid

08:40.092 --> 08:42.885
And drop out of medical
school for something that she

08:43.285 --> 08:46.253
Didn't even do, or the threat
of me knockin' your block off?

08:46.925 --> 08:49.159
Which conference room
was it again? Thank you.

08:57.098 --> 08:58.698
How did my mom sucker you...

09:02.803 --> 09:04.670
Massive guilt trip or outright threat?

09:06.645 --> 09:08.512
Hmm. I'm gonna go with outright threat.

09:09.074 --> 09:11.440
I
- It was both, actually.

09:12.545 --> 09:12.712
Jeez.

09:13.049 --> 09:14.816
Well, you know if you help me out here,

09:14.920 --> 09:17.153
It's only gonna get worse, right?

09:19.823 --> 09:20.689
I think i can manage that.

09:22.591 --> 09:22.758
Um...

09:27.230 --> 09:27.530
So, uh...

09:29.499 --> 09:30.199
Shall we get started?

09:30.501 --> 09:33.401
Oh, my god. "Sugar substitutes
and caffeine can cause

09:34.169 --> 09:36.669
A variety of prenatal..."
i am so screwed.

09:37.673 --> 09:38.006
"Screwed."

09:39.676 --> 09:42.243
As usual, the dowd's
timing is impeccable.

09:42.645 --> 09:44.545
You look so hot. I'm not kidding.

09:44.812 --> 09:47.045
The girls are like...

09:48.050 --> 09:48.183
Wow!

09:49.751 --> 09:49.918
Cute.

09:50.622 --> 09:52.988
Sorry. I just... you,
lunch. This is great.

09:52.998 --> 09:56.559
We see each other every night. No,
i see you. You see piles of work.

09:56.569 --> 09:58.962
I'm sorry, but you know how
it is... starting a new firm,

09:59.264 --> 10:02.031
Going to court, making
sure your sleazy new firm

10:02.041 --> 10:04.532
Doesn't steal all our clients.
We're not stealing anyone.

10:04.836 --> 10:07.369
These guys are c.E.O.S.
They make up their own minds.

10:08.173 --> 10:10.906
And how did you guys know the
exact hour i was gonna meet

10:10.916 --> 10:13.774
With latham's c.E.O.? If you want
to play interrogator/detainee,

10:13.784 --> 10:16.074
I am game, but we should
probably close the blinds,

10:16.084 --> 10:19.448
Don't you think? Look, someone on
your team is stealing our plays.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.716
I need you to find out for me who it is.

10:21.816 --> 10:24.416
Well, i know i seem like the
perfect guy for the job...

10:24.919 --> 10:26.386
Young, hot, ethically challenged.

10:26.396 --> 10:29.425
Thing is, i don't actually work
here anymore. God, i ask you

10:29.435 --> 10:33.529
To do one simple thing, and you can't
handle that? Uh, i wouldn't call this simple.

10:33.539 --> 10:36.097
Well, it's not like things are
gonna get any easier from here.

10:38.270 --> 10:40.603
From here? Where exactly
are we going, taylor?

10:42.070 --> 10:42.336
Nowhere.

10:43.338 --> 10:45.738
I'm sorry. I-I just...
forget i said anything, okay?

10:48.107 --> 10:50.174
No, you know what? Uh,
lunch was a bad idea.

10:54.651 --> 10:56.085
Uh, i'll, uh, see you tonight.

10:57.220 --> 10:57.920
Let's be honest here.

10:57.930 --> 11:00.222
We all know the
government has a monopoly

11:00.232 --> 11:04.125
On the supply of marijuana for medical
research. As long as it's classified

11:04.528 --> 11:07.028
As a controlled substance,
we're gonna insist on,

11:07.038 --> 11:11.066
You know, controlling it. What for? Marijuana
is legal in california for medicinal uses.

11:11.076 --> 11:13.934
Actually, it's not. California
can pass any law it wants,

11:14.573 --> 11:16.673
But it's still illegal
under federal law.

11:16.674 --> 11:19.741
Now you so much as water a
plant and i'll have you arrested.

11:19.877 --> 11:22.410
We are more than are of the
supremacy of federal law,

11:22.815 --> 11:25.315
But we also think it's
fairly obvious that mr. Cooper

11:25.325 --> 11:28.550
Is not some illicit drug trafficker. He's just
a father desperate to fight his son's disease.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.753
Infer what you will
about the public opinion

11:30.763 --> 11:33.355
Fallout from that. I'm more
concerned about the publicconsumption.

11:33.690 --> 11:36.390
We start making exceptions,
and it's a slippery slope.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.996
Marijuana is a gateway to more dangerous
drugs. Right, like ecstasy and l.S.D.,

11:40.006 --> 11:41.997
Both of which scientists
can easily obtain

11:42.007 --> 11:45.064
From any number of private
laboratories. So that's what's next...

11:45.074 --> 11:46.966
L.S.D. For cancer?
Ecstasy for parkinson's?

11:47.670 --> 11:49.870
Hey, maybe i can get
some crack for my eczema.

11:50.340 --> 11:52.673
Look, you want to grasp
at straws, be my guest.

11:54.940 --> 11:55.740
Just stick to snake oils

11:57.745 --> 11:59.378
That aren't federally regulated, okay?

12:00.515 --> 12:01.182
We're not giving up.

12:01.386 --> 12:04.186
And with your son still in an
early stage of the disease...

12:04.355 --> 12:06.488
Early is too late when it comes to m.S.

12:06.498 --> 12:08.956
With every new attack,
the damage is done,

12:09.225 --> 12:11.591
And it's permanent... at
least, it was with vanessa.

12:12.825 --> 12:13.292
That's my mom.

12:13.302 --> 12:15.430
So sorry. J. Was 3 when she got sick.

12:15.564 --> 12:18.164
At first, her episodes
were so few and far between,

12:20.104 --> 12:22.137
We thought we could
keep it at bay, but...

12:22.507 --> 12:25.574
Look, i can't promise you that
you'll be able to swim forever,

12:25.877 --> 12:28.143
But i can promise you i'm gonna get

12:28.153 --> 12:31.945
Your dad's hands on enough pot for the study. Oh,
please don't say you know a guy who knows a guy.

12:31.955 --> 12:36.085
Well, i do. His name is uncle sam. Oh, you're
gonna sue the government for their dope?

12:36.520 --> 12:39.653
Actually, when it's grown on
tax dollars, it's your dope, too.

12:39.663 --> 12:43.191
I like this guy. Listen,
let me takj. To school.

12:44.357 --> 12:45.257
We'll talk more over lunch.

12:50.198 --> 12:50.365
Whoa.

13:42.784 --> 13:43.251
Hey! Hey, you!

13:45.419 --> 13:46.319
You gotta get out of there!

14:07.675 --> 14:07.908
I'm s...

14:10.744 --> 14:11.444
Watch your step here.

14:19.119 --> 14:19.385
Come on.

14:18.103 --> 14:20.269
The whole building was burning?

14:20.279 --> 14:23.169
You'd think a vision about a pot
case would be a little more fun.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.507
Well, you'd think that
with my brain aneurysm,

14:25.577 --> 14:28.177
God would avoid sharp
spikes to my blood pressure.

14:28.187 --> 14:30.177
So you were surrounded by flames.

14:30.914 --> 14:32.747
Well, there's the obvious associion...

14:33.182 --> 14:35.882
Drop the case or burn in the
all-Consuming fires of hell?

14:36.389 --> 14:38.156
Just rember which of us said it first.

14:38.355 --> 14:41.022
But fire can also
represent the manifestation

14:41.032 --> 14:43.892
Of the divine... like when god
appeared before the israelites

14:43.992 --> 14:46.559
At mount sinai in a
cloud of smoke and fire.

14:47.096 --> 14:49.363
Nah, i'm pretty sure it's
the going-To-Hell one.

14:50.869 --> 14:53.435
A few days ago, my files
on cooper burst into flames.

14:53.445 --> 14:56.170
You had another vision? I didn't
think much of it at the time

14:56.180 --> 14:59.472
Until the musical vision, in which
jordan was singing... thirdvision?

14:59.643 --> 15:01.610
"You don't mess around with jim."

15:01.620 --> 15:05.748
That one ended with fire, too. You waited
to come to me until after three visions

15:05.758 --> 15:08.383
Warned you to drop this cooper
case? Maybe they weren't warnings.

15:08.584 --> 15:10.951
"You don't mess around with jim."

15:10.961 --> 15:15.622
And here you are, messing around with jim. A
vision has never told me to drop a case before.

15:15.692 --> 15:18.225
And why cooper? I mean,
this man is going to the ends

15:18.329 --> 15:20.962
Of the earth for his son.
My dad couldn't even make it

15:20.972 --> 15:24.265
To parent/teacher conference. A
devoted and protective father...

15:24.335 --> 15:27.235
I can see why you're having
trouble letting go of this case.

15:27.436 --> 15:29.969
No, i'm just having trouble
seeing how god's plan

15:30.373 --> 15:32.407
Is "don't find a cure for a debilitating

15:32.417 --> 15:35.339
And possibly fatal disease."
He's god. Don't backseat deify.

15:35.812 --> 15:37.245
I'm not. I'm front seat litigating.

15:37.255 --> 15:39.680
Am i supposed to just
blindly follow these visions?

15:41.115 --> 15:41.948
I'm not just a messenger.

15:42.853 --> 15:44.920
Be careful, eli. Going
against the visions...

15:46.754 --> 15:47.120
It's risky.

15:48.189 --> 15:50.656
Yeah? Well, if god wanted
a puppet for a prophet,

15:51.959 --> 15:53.725
He should've chosen an accountant.

15:54.797 --> 15:56.530
Mr. Smalls, who is
usually granted access

15:57.533 --> 15:58.400
To n.I.H. Cannabis stores?

15:59.337 --> 16:02.337
Universities, health agencies,
scientific institutions...

16:03.034 --> 16:04.001
Very controlled environments.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.005
What about the private individuals?

16:06.015 --> 16:09.843
Do they ever receive n.I.H.
- Sanctioned pot? Object to the term "pot" as prejudicial.

16:09.979 --> 16:12.179
My client isn't asking for a doobie.

16:12.748 --> 16:15.215
Sustained. Let's keep the
slang to a minimum, people.

16:15.753 --> 16:18.053
Plaintiff's lawyers
claim that your decision

16:18.287 --> 16:21.121
Not to grant him its marijuana
constitutes a capricious

16:21.131 --> 16:23.625
And arbitrary decision.
It's a security issue.

16:24.095 --> 16:27.161
Besides, two identical studies
involving cannabis and m.S.

16:27.171 --> 16:29.429
Were already approved and ongoing.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.867
We didn't see the need for a third one.

16:35.003 --> 16:35.903
So these other two studies,

16:36.138 --> 16:38.638
They were designed to
test the efficacy of nnabis

16:39.806 --> 16:40.573
On juvenile onset m.S.?

16:40.709 --> 16:42.909
No. Sorry, i-I thought
that you just said

16:43.614 --> 16:45.981
That they were identical
to mr. Cooper's study.

16:45.984 --> 16:48.684
Identical in that they
both tested the effects

16:48.694 --> 16:51.552
Of cannabis on m.S. But both
those studies only accept subjects

16:51.562 --> 16:53.789
Over the age of 18, right? The n.I.H...

16:53.799 --> 16:56.123
Isn't gonna supply cannabis
to any study involving minors.

16:56.627 --> 16:59.361
So you would never supply
cannabis to mr. Cooper's study.

16:59.429 --> 17:02.329
Director smalls, are you aware
that federal law prohibits

17:02.339 --> 17:04.031
Unjustified discrimination based on age?

17:04.041 --> 17:06.367
Yes. I'm also aware that
the government shouldn't be

17:06.377 --> 17:09.170
Helping a bunch of teens get
baked on the taxpayers' dime.

17:09.180 --> 17:12.105
The kids in mr. Cooper's study
wouldn't be getting "baked."

17:12.115 --> 17:14.473
They'd be getting relief
from a horrible disease.

17:15.277 --> 17:17.544
M.S. Doesn't discriminate based on age.

17:18.642 --> 17:19.509
Why should the government?

17:20.881 --> 17:22.114
It's not gonna happen.

17:22.983 --> 17:25.117
I let you smooth-Talk
your way out ofroner,

17:25.127 --> 17:27.655
But i can't this time.
It's her first offense, sam.

17:27.891 --> 17:30.491
Not with a blood alcohol level of.085%.

17:30.501 --> 17:32.958
You have to have some serious
tolerance to drink and drive

17:32.968 --> 17:35.629
With that much alcohol in your system.
Trust me, this isn't a regular thing at all.

17:35.639 --> 17:37.932
She's got zero priors.
This is a 1-Time mistake.

17:37.942 --> 17:39.933
Besides, you and i both
know that a breathalyzer

17:40.904 --> 17:43.671
Can be off by at least 10%.
But the blood test won't be.

17:43.681 --> 17:45.872
Doesn't change the fact
that she didn't commit

17:45.882 --> 17:48.143
A moving violation. She did,
according to officer sawyer.

17:48.153 --> 17:50.476
Oh, officer sawyer.
Nowthere's a trustworthy urce.

17:50.881 --> 17:53.348
In his sworn statement,
he said that ms. Scott was,

17:53.551 --> 17:56.451
"Weaving in and out of traffic
and appeared disoriented."

17:58.153 --> 18:00.886
He only said thataftershe
turned him down for a date.

18:01.957 --> 18:04.257
He mention that in his
statement? I'm guessing not.

18:04.661 --> 18:06.961
Because that's just an
unsubstantiated allegation.

18:08.497 --> 18:11.430
And six allegations in a row
is a sexual harassment lawsuit.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.435
Angela's the sixth woman

18:14.003 --> 18:16.836
He's tried to pick up while
on the job since november.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.506
I'm thinking officer sawyer's definition

18:20.207 --> 18:22.940
Of "to protect and serve"
might need a little adjustment.

18:23.942 --> 18:25.675
I think i like the smooth-Talk better.

18:26.813 --> 18:27.913
Wow, impressive.

18:29.116 --> 18:31.050
My mom was right.
Youarea hotshot lawyer.

18:31.053 --> 18:33.053
Some pretty mad skills back there.

18:33.156 --> 18:35.490
Well, it helps when
you're extra motivated.

18:35.724 --> 18:38.457
So, uh, you doing anything
special to celebrate?

18:39.922 --> 18:40.689
I was gonna get loaded.

18:42.359 --> 18:42.625
Kidding.

18:45.268 --> 18:46.501
Wait. Were y just asking me out?

18:46.511 --> 18:49.437
Trying to. I guess i don't have
the same mad skills with women

18:50.538 --> 18:51.438
That i do in the courtroom.

18:55.181 --> 18:56.081
I kinda like that in a guy.

18:59.040 --> 18:59.607
So is that a yes?

19:03.950 --> 19:04.117
Yeah.

19:08.392 --> 19:11.259
What happened? The cool kids
ban you from their table?

19:11.395 --> 19:13.628
Hmm. They all went to godzilla's.

19:15.498 --> 19:17.732
Sushi freaks me out. You
live in san francisco.

19:18.701 --> 19:21.201
I'm fromohio,where we
believe in cooking fish.

19:21.237 --> 19:24.003
The midwest sounds awesome.
Remind me never to go there.

19:24.439 --> 19:26.006
Shut up. So what's your excuse?

19:26.509 --> 19:28.576
Thought you were
meeting taylor for lunch.

19:28.580 --> 19:31.513
Uh, no, that would require
her actually wanting to see me.

19:31.523 --> 19:35.455
You guys got in a fight? It's
a little hard to tell, actually.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.349
She, um, she thinks someone at wethersby

19:37.359 --> 19:39.316
Is leaking information to someone here

19:40.357 --> 19:41.990
So we can steal all their clients.

19:42.923 --> 19:44.989
You know who's doing it? I don't know.

19:45.326 --> 19:47.126
Taylor wants me to find out, but, uh...

19:47.861 --> 19:49.794
Mm. No wonder you're in the doghouse.

19:50.529 --> 19:52.496
You'd think life would
get less complicated

19:53.736 --> 19:55.336
When we weren't working together.

19:55.339 --> 19:58.272
She'll forgive you... maybe
not right away, but she will.

19:58.974 --> 20:01.474
You get caught spying
on these guys over here,

20:08.385 --> 20:10.251
I don't think they're gonna be as nice.

20:11.520 --> 20:12.087
Hey. Hey.

20:13.418 --> 20:13.951
Everything okay?

20:15.424 --> 20:17.124
Yeah. I just... i thought i'd stop by,

20:18.259 --> 20:19.126
See how the trial's going.

20:19.562 --> 20:22.262
My dad says he's gonna win,
but he always thinks that.

20:22.700 --> 20:25.300
Oh, well, in this case, he
has reason to be optimistic,

20:26.269 --> 20:28.269
'Cause we're in great shape. Oh.

20:28.639 --> 20:31.105
So, uh, having your
dad go to court so that

20:31.907 --> 20:34.741
You could get high... must
be the coolest kid in school.

20:36.712 --> 20:39.412
I'm a swimmer. I don't put
alcohol or drugs in my body.

20:39.649 --> 20:41.382
Absolutely. I was a mathlete.

20:42.582 --> 20:43.349
We had a similar ethos.

20:44.354 --> 20:46.654
If the league finds out, you know,

20:47.021 --> 20:49.888
That i have pot in my system,
even if it's for the study,

20:50.192 --> 20:52.092
I'll be disqualified from competions,

20:52.102 --> 20:56.924
And i won't be able to go out for olympic
pretrials. I didn't reali that. I'm sorry.

20:58.107 --> 20:58.273
Yeah.

20:59.868 --> 21:02.835
You know, i know there's this
thing eating away at my brain,

21:04.970 --> 21:07.170
But it's like, right now i don't care.

21:07.884 --> 21:09.384
All i care about is swimming.

21:10.380 --> 21:13.080
It's the only part of my
life that's still mine.

21:14.445 --> 21:15.011
What do you mean?

21:16.480 --> 21:16.980
My dad. He's...

21:18.985 --> 21:20.285
Everything has to be his way.

21:20.288 --> 21:22.422
He's been telling me
what to do for so long,

21:23.522 --> 21:24.389
Even when he's not around,

21:24.826 --> 21:26.826
I can't get his voice out of my head...

21:27.960 --> 21:28.793
Except when i'm swimming.

21:31.967 --> 21:34.200
When i'm underwater, i
don't think about stuff.

21:35.636 --> 21:38.469
I'm just counting the tiles
on the bottom, back and forth.

21:41.375 --> 21:42.008
He can't get to me.

21:42.439 --> 21:44.839
Do you evenwantto be
in this clinical trial?

21:49.149 --> 21:49.216
No

21:51.252 --> 21:51.985
But this whole case...

21:53.253 --> 21:53.686
Is about you.

21:54.056 --> 21:55.656
I
- I mean, i'm fighting for you,

21:56.654 --> 21:59.254
And now you tell me that
you don't even want this?

22:01.162 --> 22:01.562
No, i don't.

22:02.924 --> 22:03.557
Does your dad know?

22:04.632 --> 22:04.865
Mm-Hmm.

22:05.468 --> 22:07.901
Then why is he pushing
so hard for thstudy?

22:08.969 --> 22:09.902
He doesn't care what i want.

22:10.306 --> 22:12.839
I've tried to talk to him.
He never listens to me.

22:13.473 --> 22:16.340
Maybe it's just that he
knows what you're up against,

22:16.979 --> 22:18.545
I mean, what happened with your mom.

22:18.748 --> 22:21.581
I mean, he obviously loves
you very much. I mean...

22:21.749 --> 22:24.349
You have to believe that he
wants what's best for you.

22:25.653 --> 22:27.753
You wouldn't think that if you knew him.

22:28.589 --> 22:31.023
Look, if you want to win
this case for him, fine.

22:51.041 --> 22:53.108
Beautiful morning, isn't it?

22:53.340 --> 22:55.407
I hear the night is
gonna be lovely, too...

22:55.678 --> 22:57.345
Clear skies, stars out, very romantic.

22:57.355 --> 23:00.379
Do you have any big plans? Patti, i
- I was just about to...

23:00.747 --> 23:02.480
When i asked for an attorney at law,

23:02.921 --> 23:04.521
I wasn't asking
for a son-In-Law!

23:04.531 --> 23:06.754
I'm not marrying
angela. It's just dinner.

23:07.193 --> 23:10.026
Are you really threatening to
shank me with a butter knife?

23:10.693 --> 23:13.893
Come on. And just suppose i
am. Now... do you really want

23:14.265 --> 23:16.165
To take my sweet
little angela on a date?

23:16.901 --> 23:18.968
Well, i-I'll take good care her.

23:21.869 --> 23:22.202
I promise.

23:26.508 --> 23:28.408
You gonna be here after i'm gone

23:30.178 --> 23:30.611
May 6, 2007...

23:31.214 --> 23:33.448
I'll never forget it.
I went into j.'S bedroom

23:34.250 --> 23:35.117
To wake him up for school,

23:35.452 --> 23:38.186
And he said he couldn't
feel anything in his arms.

23:39.489 --> 23:41.756
And that first attack
lasted several weeks.

23:42.057 --> 23:44.190
And then shortly after he was dgnosed,

23:44.200 --> 23:46.060
I was driving him to a swim meet,

23:46.931 --> 23:49.331
And he just turned to me, out of thelue

23:51.102 --> 23:53.502
And asked why i couldn't work on a cure.

23:53.512 --> 23:56.170
"You do everything else, dad," he said.

23:58.941 --> 24:01.574
And that's when i decided
i was gonna beat this thing.

24:01.679 --> 24:03.679
Still, setting up your
own clinical trial...

24:04.580 --> 24:05.547
That is no small undertaking.

24:06.118 --> 24:08.885
Why not simply donate money
to existing studies on m.S.?

24:08.895 --> 24:11.821
If i wait for nonprofit research
to bring a drug to market,

24:12.557 --> 24:14.657
It could be too late for j.

24:14.667 --> 24:16.558
I lost my wife to this disease.

24:17.961 --> 24:18.728
J.'S all i've got left.

24:18.763 --> 24:21.096
If i could just get this study going...

24:21.332 --> 24:23.532
I
- I think we both need that hope.

24:23.542 --> 24:26.135
I mean, the fact that my son
is willing to give up swimming

24:26.145 --> 24:28.880
Just to be able to take
part in this clinical trial,

24:28.890 --> 24:32.939
I think that says it all. Of course, you have
never heard him say that in so many words.

24:33.974 --> 24:36.108
I mean, just rember,
everything you say here

24:36.481 --> 24:38.247
Is on record, so let's avoid speculating

24:38.257 --> 24:40.850
As to your son's state
of mind. Moving on...

24:41.818 --> 24:44.418
I
- It's not speculation. He's told me this many ti...

24:44.757 --> 24:47.257
Unfortuny, that's
hearsay coming from you,

24:47.267 --> 24:49.823
So i guess i have no... your
honor, i have a few other questions.

24:51.394 --> 24:53.128
Uh, but first i would like a recess

24:53.138 --> 24:55.196
To speak with my client.
That won't be necessary.

24:55.206 --> 24:57.032
I think it is, if for no other reason

24:57.042 --> 25:00.269
Than for you two to
get on the same page.

25:00.572 --> 25:03.605
It was a simple misunderstanding
between my partner and me.

25:03.615 --> 25:07.108
I'll take over from here and get you right
back on track. You better. I was on a roll.

25:07.118 --> 25:10.779
You were rolling right into prison
for perjury. Are you out of your mind?

25:10.789 --> 25:14.882
Eli, we don't generally accuse our clients of
breaking the law. I'm sorry, but as your lawyer,

25:14.892 --> 25:17.418
It's my responsibility to protect you.
Everything i said on that stand was the truth.

25:18.355 --> 25:20.889
The truth is that your
son does not want to be

25:21.621 --> 25:22.388
In this clinical trial.

25:23.261 --> 25:24.894
He told me. He just wants to swim.

25:29.833 --> 25:30.500
Wait outside for me.

25:31.133 --> 25:33.399
You talked to my son without me?

25:33.771 --> 25:35.738
You have to think
about what's best for j.

25:35.748 --> 25:38.506
Placing him in a clinical trial
against his will... he's 16 years old!

25:39.242 --> 25:41.342
He doesn't know what's good for him!

25:41.352 --> 25:45.147
And he doesn't need you putting ideas in his
head. He came to me, and he knows a lot more

25:45.157 --> 25:49.551
Than you give him credit for. If you just listened to
him... look, i'm not paying you for parenting advice.

25:52.591 --> 25:54.991
I'm paying you to win this case for me.

25:55.001 --> 25:56.992
You involve yourself with my family,

25:57.002 --> 25:59.691
I'm gonna have to get myself involved
with yours. What's that supposed to mean?

25:59.960 --> 26:01.760
Your brother works at st. Vincent's,

26:02.830 --> 26:04.397
Right, mr. Stone? Small world.

26:04.407 --> 26:07.900
I'm the largest donor to that hospital.

26:07.910 --> 26:10.371
Are there any other conversations

26:10.474 --> 26:13.007
I should be privy to as
your co-Counsel on this case?

26:13.017 --> 26:15.442
I'm sorry. I just... i
didn't think it was relevant.

26:15.679 --> 26:18.246
I had no idea that cooper
was gonna perjure himself.

26:18.545 --> 26:21.211
I should've listened to you
from the start. I just...

26:22.481 --> 26:23.748
Cleay not the perfect client.

26:23.758 --> 26:26.352
But we can still get out of
this. That's not an option.

26:26.362 --> 26:29.624
Well, neither is being in bed with this guy.
I have been representing jim cooper since 1987,

26:29.634 --> 26:32.560
When he first retained w.P.K.
In all the years i've known him,

26:32.764 --> 26:35.231
He's been nothing less than
a brilliant businessman,

26:35.241 --> 26:38.532
A munificent philanthropist and a
world-Class ass. Apparently,i'mthe ass.

26:38.736 --> 26:40.903
Here i was thinking that
we had a new mission.

26:40.939 --> 26:44.039
We do... it's to represent
clients whose business practices

26:44.049 --> 26:46.875
Do no harm, not clients who win
the father of the year award.

26:46.885 --> 26:49.040
If that were our
criteria, there wouldn't be

26:49.510 --> 26:50.977
Anyone left on our client roster,

26:51.548 --> 26:53.948
Nor would i be running
this firm, for that matter.

27:00.554 --> 27:02.987
You're pulling out all the stops.

27:04.394 --> 27:05.827
How do you know i like thai?

27:07.229 --> 27:07.529
I didn't.

27:07.732 --> 27:10.532
I just figured i'd be safer
with chopsticks on the table.

27:10.542 --> 27:13.535
I can't believe my mom
pulled a butter knife on you.

27:14.538 --> 27:16.005
I'm so mortified. Don't be.

27:17.939 --> 27:18.605
So what's good here?

27:19.206 --> 27:20.039
The pineapple duck curry.

27:20.844 --> 27:22.844
Had it last week. It
was out of this world.

27:22.854 --> 27:25.981
You mean on another date? No, i
was just out with some friends.

27:27.412 --> 27:27.646
Uh-Huh.

27:28.016 --> 27:30.049
Okay, if you think i'm
some sort of player,

27:31.120 --> 27:31.853
Trust me, um, i'm not.

27:32.957 --> 27:35.724
Yeah, which is exactly
what a player would say.

27:36.153 --> 27:38.620
You probably got girls
lined up all weekend.

27:40.089 --> 27:40.255
Um...

27:42.494 --> 27:42.728
Try me.

27:44.801 --> 27:46.034
I don't feel no shame

27:47.870 --> 27:47.970
Oh.

27:50.372 --> 27:51.039
You call your mom...

27:52.071 --> 27:52.271
A lot.

27:55.547 --> 27:57.980
Okay, so that makes you
a ma's boyanda player.

28:00.085 --> 28:03.018
You're tough, like your mom. Well...

28:04.419 --> 28:05.086
Dad, the law firm...

28:07.957 --> 28:08.057
Me.

28:09.792 --> 28:10.192
Unh-Unh-Unh.

28:11.761 --> 28:12.428
And a call to terry.

28:12.629 --> 28:14.929
Ooh, and another one and another one.

28:14.939 --> 28:17.196
So she's your saturday night, huh?

28:18.833 --> 28:20.667
Um,she'smy brother... terence.

28:25.374 --> 28:25.474
Oh.

28:26.476 --> 28:28.742
You guys are close,
huh? Yeah, he's, uh, 17,

28:29.141 --> 28:31.608
Thinking about dropping
out of high school.

28:32.246 --> 28:33.613
I'm lking him off the ledge.

28:34.751 --> 28:36.517
Yeah, well, don't push
him too hard, okay?

28:37.754 --> 28:40.387
My mom's been pushing me
since kindergarten, and...

28:43.621 --> 28:44.521
You didn't turn out so bad.

28:46.126 --> 28:46.560
Wow.

28:47.958 --> 28:48.791
That meal was to die for.

28:50.634 --> 28:52.534
Ugh. Can't believe i'm going to ruin it

28:53.538 --> 28:56.338
By getting hospital
commissary fro-Yo for dessert.

28:57.207 --> 28:58.940
Yeah, well, uh,

28:59.210 --> 29:01.943
I'm up for some bad fro-Yo
if you want some company.

29:03.311 --> 29:06.211
I would love to, but my shift
starts in, like, 30 minutes.

29:07.882 --> 29:08.582
Hey, maybe next time.

29:31.466 --> 29:32.166
Hey. Come in. What...

29:33.205 --> 29:33.438
What...

29:34.008 --> 29:35.875
You want a... you want
a coffee or something?

29:36.413 --> 29:38.946
You want a soda,
water? Uh, no, actually,

29:38.981 --> 29:41.548
I- I just came by about
some work-Related stuff.

29:43.218 --> 29:44.118
Okay, so we'll skip coffee.

29:44.128 --> 29:46.984
And now you can help me with
my closing for the cooper case.

29:48.325 --> 29:50.091
I'm just kidding. Or not.

29:51.291 --> 29:52.091
I heard about the trial,

29:52.101 --> 29:55.362
How your client almost perjured
himself. How'd you hear about that?

29:55.963 --> 29:58.363
And why are you passing
me a piece of paper...

30:02.271 --> 30:04.371
With the name of one
of my employees on it?

30:06.443 --> 30:08.409
It's the leak. Matt told me about it.

30:08.419 --> 30:11.011
To be honest, i'm surprised
you didn't ask for my help.

30:12.981 --> 30:13.881
Well, you were gone, and...

30:14.914 --> 30:15.848
I didn't think it was right.

30:17.484 --> 30:19.651
Besides, you could
lose your job for this.

30:20.023 --> 30:21.623
Turns out it's kind of an advantage

30:21.850 --> 30:24.217
To be the lone guppy in the shark tank.

30:27.862 --> 30:27.962
Oh.

30:29.896 --> 30:30.729
Since i do pro bono work,

30:31.267 --> 30:33.334
Everyone thinks i'm
noble and trustworthy...

30:34.669 --> 30:35.402
Like the oprah of p&k.

30:36.036 --> 30:39.003
I ask a few choice questions,
people tell me everything.

30:39.705 --> 30:41.738
So head of pro bono
and the office shrink.

30:42.144 --> 30:43.677
Sounds like you got promoted twice.

30:45.379 --> 30:45.546
Yeah.

30:45.949 --> 30:48.816
It's not at all what i
thought it was gonna be like.

30:50.819 --> 30:51.519
The work is... is good,

30:52.922 --> 30:54.922
And the people are super friendly.

30:58.057 --> 30:58.390
I love it.

31:01.396 --> 31:02.162
I'm very happy for you.

31:04.499 --> 31:04.665
Yeah.

31:06.999 --> 31:07.232
Thanks.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.968
Well, i-I guess i'd
better let you get back.

31:13.371 --> 31:13.871
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

31:15.271 --> 31:15.871
Um, hey, it was...

31:18.313 --> 31:19.480
It's... it's greato see you.

31:23.018 --> 31:23.318
You, too.

31:26.054 --> 31:26.854
I can't help but miss...

31:28.650 --> 31:28.883
Things.

31:30.788 --> 31:30.955
Yeah.

31:41.735 --> 31:42.368
I miss things, too.

31:51.479 --> 31:54.313
I could stand up here
for hours and talk about

31:54.856 --> 31:56.890
The humanitarianism of jim cooper.

31:57.917 --> 31:58.783
But i'm not gonna do that.

31:59.322 --> 32:01.355
See, i'm a lawyer, and as you know,

32:03.325 --> 32:04.325
We lawyers love hypotheticals.

32:06.161 --> 32:09.227
So... what if my client weren't
the admirable philanthropist?

32:10.097 --> 32:11.964
What if he was someone else entirely...

32:12.368 --> 32:14.434
An egomaniacal jerk, for instance?

32:15.402 --> 32:16.368
Let's even say... and remember,

32:16.572 --> 32:18.539
This is just for the sake of argument...

32:21.678 --> 32:24.711
That he does not have his
son's best interests at heart.

32:26.515 --> 32:29.382
Even if you assume all this,
the law is still on his side.

32:29.618 --> 32:31.718
Whatever jim cooper is or is not,

32:31.728 --> 32:33.719
The fact is that his
study will take place

32:34.320 --> 32:36.320
In a controlled,
high-Security facility.

32:36.725 --> 32:38.325
The fact is that it would not violate

32:38.429 --> 32:41.362
Any of the u.S. International
treaties regarding marijuana.

32:42.962 --> 32:43.995
And i'll tell you another fact.

32:45.033 --> 32:45.499
200 years ago,

32:45.869 --> 32:48.702
Another father injected
his son with a live virus.

32:52.241 --> 32:55.108
The experiment was considered
risky and lacking in merit.

33:02.920 --> 33:05.520
And that gave us the
vaccine for smallpox.

33:05.530 --> 33:08.456
Yeah, and can you make sure that
gets to judge phelps by noon?

33:09.157 --> 33:09.857
Thanks. Keith.

33:09.867 --> 33:12.260
Oh. Look, look, i know
what you're gonna say.

33:12.270 --> 33:15.428
And... and you have every right
to be protective of your daughter,

33:16.399 --> 33:18.532
But the truth is, i
really like her, all right?

33:18.542 --> 33:21.269
And i think she might like
me. So if you don't mind,

33:21.279 --> 33:25.269
How about just giving us some space
here, huh? I just came to tell you

33:28.144 --> 33:30.044
She said she had a
great time last night.

33:31.944 --> 33:32.677
She say anything else?

33:36.818 --> 33:37.518
Don't push your luck.

33:41.053 --> 33:42.120
In ruling on jim cooper's study,

33:43.590 --> 33:45.490
I have to balance drug use by minors

33:46.292 --> 33:48.259
Against potential scientific benefits.

33:48.964 --> 33:50.431
In light of the government's failure

33:50.766 --> 33:53.699
To present compelling evidence
that mr. Cooper's study

33:53.936 --> 33:56.236
Would adversely affect drug enforcement

33:56.246 --> 34:00.738
In this country, i find
in favor of the petioner.

34:02.311 --> 34:03.678
How about that, kiddo?

34:06.179 --> 34:06.412
We won.

34:06.749 --> 34:09.016
With all due respect, sir, youwon.

34:09.025 --> 34:11.414
Trial's over, eli. Mr. Cooper
no longer requires our advice,

34:11.424 --> 34:14.186
Just our bill. Then i'll
throw this one in for free.

34:14.222 --> 34:16.455
Look, you've already
had 16 years with him.

34:16.465 --> 34:18.559
He's done everything you've told him to.

34:18.628 --> 34:21.661
Maybe just this once you could
let him make his own decision.

34:22.594 --> 34:23.428
Tell him what you told me

34:23.438 --> 34:25.898
About how you feel about
the study. Eli, let's go.

34:26.268 --> 34:28.503
Just... just tell him,
right here, right now.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.369
What do you want to tell me, j.?

34:33.905 --> 34:34.072
Uh...

34:35.507 --> 34:36.206
Go on. You can do it.

34:36.342 --> 34:38.208
He needs to hear this from you.

34:42.614 --> 34:43.246
It's... it's nothing.

34:44.585 --> 34:45.253
Sorry. It's nothing.

34:45.255 --> 34:47.588
Hey, what do you say we celebrate?

34:47.623 --> 34:49.924
Any restaurant you want, huh?

34:51.458 --> 34:52.125
How does that sound?

34:54.663 --> 34:56.730
Thank you again for all your hard work.

35:04.436 --> 35:05.003
I'll be in touch.

35:11.479 --> 35:11.946
Keith bennett.

35:12.612 --> 35:15.645
Hey, i'm sorry, but, uh, didn't
we settle this two days ago?

35:16.117 --> 35:17.817
We did, but then we got the results

35:18.617 --> 35:19.450
Angela's blood test back,

35:21.858 --> 35:23.758
And we found traces of b.E. And e.M.E.

35:25.391 --> 35:25.658
Cocaine?

35:26.095 --> 35:28.095
Are... are you... are
you saying angela...

35:30.099 --> 35:32.432
I mean... my client... was on cocaine?

35:33.530 --> 35:33.830
You sure?

35:34.068 --> 35:35.835
Look, we already dropped the charges,

35:35.845 --> 35:38.371
But given your relationship
with the client's mother,

35:39.507 --> 35:40.374
I thought you should know.

35:42.910 --> 35:43.076
Um...

35:44.312 --> 35:44.478
Yeah.

35:49.215 --> 35:49.848
Thank... thanks, sam.

36:03.928 --> 36:06.561
And finally, we have had our
first g victory this week.

36:06.571 --> 36:09.030
Jim cooper's clinical
trial will be going ahead

36:10.932 --> 36:13.599
Using the government
supply of marijuana.

36:14.601 --> 36:16.834
As we anticipated, cooper's
presence has given us

36:17.503 --> 36:19.203
An opening with some
other heavy hitters.

36:19.741 --> 36:21.208
Thanks to mr. Stone's legal ingenuity,

36:22.476 --> 36:24.676
Not only are our calls being returned...

36:25.814 --> 36:28.948
We've also been able to upgrade
to a better class of breakfast.

36:28.958 --> 36:31.519
And i just spoke with the president

36:31.718 --> 36:34.218
Of the u.C.S.F. Pension
fund and the c.E.O.

36:34.319 --> 36:36.219
Of the essen ware charitable foundation,

36:37.125 --> 36:38.691
Both of which are now our clients.

36:42.626 --> 36:43.426
So great work, everyone.

36:43.998 --> 36:45.331
Rudy, uh, do you have a second?

36:45.341 --> 36:47.364
I got a depo in ten. Can it wait?

36:47.630 --> 36:49.230
No, but i'll... i'll make it quick.

36:50.437 --> 36:50.604
Um...

36:51.608 --> 36:54.108
Uh, we know that you have
been feeding information

36:55.044 --> 36:57.744
About our business
strategies to posner & klein.

36:57.754 --> 37:00.014
You jeopardized the future of this firm

37:00.024 --> 37:05.217
And everyone who works here. Look, if you
want to fire me, just get it over with.

37:05.227 --> 37:09.320
Why did you stay here? I don't
know. Shorter commute maybe.

37:10.423 --> 37:12.289
Or maybe because you couldn't go to p&k?

37:14.363 --> 37:16.063
They didn't even make you an offer.

37:16.073 --> 37:18.738
Wethersby, stone & associates
is only gonna be as good

37:19.736 --> 37:21.802
As the people in it,
and for that to work,

37:22.569 --> 37:25.236
You have to want to be
here. You have to believe

37:25.609 --> 37:27.242
In our cases and in what we're doing.

37:27.242 --> 37:30.142
Now if that's not what you
want, you're free to go.

37:31.147 --> 37:33.514
But if it is, you have
to show me what you can do

37:36.585 --> 37:37.485
And why you should be here.

37:46.562 --> 37:47.295
I think i can do that.

37:48.027 --> 37:50.494
I'm not sure i could've
been that gracious.

37:52.235 --> 37:53.835
You would have. You were with me.

37:53.845 --> 37:56.504
Maybe i should have been more
gracious with you this week.

37:56.506 --> 37:59.406
You were just doing what you
thought was best for the firm.

37:59.416 --> 38:01.408
But this isourfirm. We're equals.

38:01.545 --> 38:03.545
We need to make these
decisions together,

38:03.647 --> 38:05.780
And i need to respect that. Yes, sir.

38:06.716 --> 38:09.083
It's jdan. People
call you"sir" now, eli,

38:14.022 --> 38:14.856
Not the other way around.

38:16.258 --> 38:16.992
Hindsight being 20/20,

38:17.259 --> 38:19.525
Do you wish you had
followed the visions?

38:19.535 --> 38:21.495
Don't you mean foresight being 20/20?

38:22.263 --> 38:24.063
I was trying not to rub it in.

38:24.733 --> 38:27.133
I wish i hadn't messed
things up for cooper's son.

38:27.704 --> 38:30.238
But maybe something good
is gonna come of the study.

38:30.306 --> 38:33.206
And with cooper as our
client, our firm has a future.

38:33.408 --> 38:35.308
You just keep telling yourself that.

38:35.318 --> 38:37.312
Come on. I think things went pretty well

38:38.046 --> 38:41.113
Considering this was the first
time i stood up to the big guy.

38:41.950 --> 38:43.916
Hmm? Our relationship is evolving.

38:43.926 --> 38:46.920
We're having a dialogue. What you did
this week... that's not a dialogue, eli.

38:46.930 --> 38:48.890
You didn't change your
relationship with god.

38:49.659 --> 38:52.459
It's still one-Way. You
just reversed the direction.

38:52.469 --> 38:55.697
God tried to tell you something, and
you ignored him. I did not ignore him.

38:55.707 --> 38:57.697
Right, you defied him. Yeah. My bad.

38:57.896 --> 39:00.063
Or maybe i convinced him i was right,

39:00.935 --> 39:02.468
And he had nothing more to add. Hmm?

39:02.478 --> 39:06.604
Did i mention i haven't had any more
fiery visions? Night's still young.

39:07.643 --> 39:09.010
Come on. You really think that...

39:10.281 --> 39:13.114
Okay, so what exactly happens
to someone who defies god?

39:13.124 --> 39:15.182
Lots of things... i mean,
none of them ever good.

39:15.452 --> 39:17.185
Moses made one little mistake.

39:17.320 --> 39:20.486
God told him to speak to a rock
to get water for the israelites.

39:20.890 --> 39:22.490
Instead, he hit it with a stick,

39:22.500 --> 39:27.762
And bam, god forbids him from ever entering
the promised land. For hitting a rock?

39:28.264 --> 39:30.764
Yeah. Oh, and lucifer...
man, this dude...

39:30.967 --> 39:33.233
Okay, i get it. I get it. Wow. Lucifer.

39:34.567 --> 39:35.467
Way to kill a conversation.

39:38.570 --> 39:40.737
Hey. Hope it's okay i came by.

39:41.539 --> 39:42.739
No, yeah, i'm glad you did.

39:43.610 --> 39:45.076
You want a soda or something?

39:46.180 --> 39:46.580
Sure. Water.

39:46.751 --> 39:48.551
How'd you kn where i live?

39:48.561 --> 39:50.685
My dad likes to keep a personal file

39:51.885 --> 39:52.885
On everyone who works for him.

39:54.356 --> 39:55.022
That's good to know.

39:55.032 --> 39:57.359
So i guess i disappointed you yesterday.

39:58.560 --> 39:58.960
No. Come on.

39:59.162 --> 40:01.395
It's... it's hard to
stand up to a parent,

40:03.225 --> 40:04.059
Particularly your parent.

40:06.197 --> 40:06.463
You did.

40:08.335 --> 40:10.202
Everyone else is afraid of him. Not you.

40:10.407 --> 40:12.674
I've never seen anyone
stand up to him before.

40:12.674 --> 40:15.007
Well, it helps that he's not my father.

40:15.408 --> 40:17.975
I wish he weren't mine. No, you don't.

40:19.345 --> 40:21.012
I'm serious. I want to be emancipated.

40:21.022 --> 40:25.986
I don't want to be his son anymore. Look,
you're upset about the clinical trial.

40:27.318 --> 40:28.218
It's... it's not just that.

40:29.719 --> 40:30.253
It's everything.

40:31.058 --> 40:32.392
At least when my mom was around,

40:34.128 --> 40:34.928
She'd try to protect me.

40:35.295 --> 40:37.928
I know it's hard, okay,
but you have to keep trying.

40:39.797 --> 40:40.330
I'm done trying.

40:42.234 --> 40:42.701
You showed me.

40:44.037 --> 40:46.237
There's only one way to
stand up to my father.

40:47.109 --> 40:48.909
I gotta get him out of my life.

40:49.213 --> 40:52.147
I want to take him to court,
and i want you to represent me.

40:53.612 --> 40:54.379
Oh, no. No, no, no. No.

40:55.187 --> 40:55.854
Yes. Please. Please.

40:58.152 --> 41:01.152
Mr. Stone, i don't want to
live in the same house with him.

41:01.624 --> 41:03.290
I don't even want to talk to him.

41:03.992 --> 41:06.592
I don't want to have
anything to do with him.

41:08.293 --> 41:09.542
I can't take it anymore.

41:12.078 --> 41:13.678
Will you help me, mr. Stone?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
