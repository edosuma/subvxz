WEBVTT

00:01.125 --> 00:03.417
‐ How many times
have y'all been to rehab?

00:03.417 --> 00:05.125
I'm just worried
maybe it doesn't work.

00:05.125 --> 00:06.792
‐ Have you thought about
methadone? It's worth a shot.

00:06.792 --> 00:09.083
‐ The FDA would take action
against OxyContin

00:09.083 --> 00:10.667
if the drug was shown
to be unsafe

00:10.667 --> 00:12.000
when used as prescribed.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.875
‐ You think we'll be shut down
by the higher‐ups?

00:13.875 --> 00:16.125
‐ We start charging individuals
with felonies,

00:16.125 --> 00:17.833
we need the kill shot.

00:17.833 --> 00:18.917
‐ Have you spoken to Curtis?

00:18.917 --> 00:20.417
‐ Is he still
the review officer?

00:20.417 --> 00:21.875
Two years after
the drug hits the market,

00:21.875 --> 00:23.167
Curtis Wright
ends up at Purdue Pharma.

00:23.167 --> 00:24.250
‐ You're kidding me.

00:24.250 --> 00:25.625
‐ "Time Magazine's"
Man of the Year,

00:25.625 --> 00:27.125
Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

00:27.125 --> 00:30.000
‐ I just started a new firm
and I represent Purdue Pharma.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.208
‐ I'm not obsessed with work,

00:31.208 --> 00:33.042
I'm just trying to prevent
mass deaths

00:33.042 --> 00:34.708
from occurring
across the country.

00:34.708 --> 00:36.583
‐ You got any Oxy?
I'm in real bad shape.

00:36.583 --> 00:37.792
I got some H.

00:37.792 --> 00:40.750
It's way cheaper
and it's way better.

00:58.583 --> 01:01.250
Do you,
Arthur Sackler, solemnly swear

01:01.250 --> 01:04.875
the testimony you give
for this Finnix Committee

01:04.875 --> 01:06.458
will be the whole truth

01:06.458 --> 01:09.333
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:09.333 --> 01:10.917
‐ I do.

01:10.917 --> 01:14.625
The Sackler empire
is completely integrated.

01:14.625 --> 01:18.125
It can devise a new drug
in its development enterprise,

01:18.125 --> 01:20.042
have the drug
clinically tested,

01:20.042 --> 01:23.583
then secure favorable reports
on it from various hospitals

01:23.583 --> 01:25.458
where they have connections.

01:25.458 --> 01:30.875
Your company makes false
and grandiose claims

01:30.875 --> 01:32.667
about products you advertise

01:32.667 --> 01:34.792
using quotes from doctors

01:34.792 --> 01:37.708
that are, in actuality,
on your own payroll,

01:37.708 --> 01:40.333
hidden through a series
of shell companies

01:40.333 --> 01:44.333
you or your family members
secretly control.

01:44.333 --> 01:46.250
‐ Senator, my company

01:46.250 --> 01:50.750
is an ethical pharmaceutical
advertising organization

01:50.750 --> 01:53.083
working in prescription drugs

01:53.083 --> 01:56.208
and materials produced
primarily for physicians.

01:56.208 --> 01:58.542
We continue to operate
on the basis

01:58.542 --> 02:02.333
that good, ethical
pharmaceutical advertising

02:02.333 --> 02:04.042
plays a positive role

02:04.042 --> 02:07.500
in advancing the health
of the community.

02:11.333 --> 02:15.125
I have a very, very high regard
for Purdue Pharma

02:15.125 --> 02:17.208
and its employees
from my district

02:17.208 --> 02:20.417
who work very, very hard
to produce quality products.

02:20.417 --> 02:22.875
Now, the drug OxyContin
has become vital

02:22.875 --> 02:26.375
to people suffering with
chronic and debilitating pain.

02:26.375 --> 02:29.292
Now, let me ask Dr. Van Zee,
and I quote here,

02:29.292 --> 02:33.125
"Conventional wisdom says that
if a drug is widely available,

02:33.125 --> 02:35.708
it will become widely abused."

02:35.708 --> 02:38.000
Is there any more to this
than that?

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
‐ Senator Dodd,
that is an old medical adage.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.958
‐ One of
those Appalachian things?

02:44.958 --> 02:49.833
‐ Uh, no,
it's a national adage.

02:49.833 --> 02:53.000
I would say by extension,
if you have an abuseable drug

02:53.000 --> 02:57.792
that is widely available,
it will be widely abused.

02:57.792 --> 03:00.208
In the 25 years
I have practiced medicine

03:00.208 --> 03:02.292
in my small Appalachian town,

03:02.292 --> 03:04.708
there has never been anything
to compare

03:04.708 --> 03:08.542
to the epidemic of drug abuse
and addiction like OxyContin.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.583
‐ If you see this girl,

03:23.583 --> 03:25.542
just give a call
at that number below.

03:25.542 --> 03:27.042
There's a reward.

03:27.042 --> 03:28.333
Excuse me.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.958
I'm trying to find my daughter,
Betsy Mallum.

03:30.958 --> 03:31.958
Have you seen her?

03:33.750 --> 03:38.458
Please, tell her we're not mad,
we're just real worried.

03:43.583 --> 03:45.458
‐ I know where she is.

04:02.250 --> 04:04.750
‐ Betsy.

04:04.750 --> 04:06.375
Betsy.

04:06.375 --> 04:10.333
Betsy, Betsy.
It's Mama.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.208
‐ Hon.
‐ Mom.

04:12.208 --> 04:17.167
I'm here, I'm here.
Betsy?

04:17.167 --> 04:19.250
‐ I want to go home.
‐ Okay.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.875
I never hated myself more

04:23.875 --> 04:26.792
than when I agreed
to get arrest reports.

04:26.792 --> 04:29.083
Some of my former patients.

04:29.083 --> 04:32.875
Some of them I had delivered
as babies.

04:32.875 --> 04:34.458
The shame
and the guilt I felt‐‐

04:34.458 --> 04:35.542
‐ Okay, you know what,

04:35.542 --> 04:38.250
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Sam.

04:38.250 --> 04:40.667
Sam, can you tell me
how many babies you delivered

04:40.667 --> 04:41.708
over the years?

04:41.708 --> 04:44.250
‐ 214.

04:44.250 --> 04:46.750
‐ 214, wow.
‐ Yep, 214.

04:46.750 --> 04:48.833
In those days, you know,
you had to do it all.

04:48.833 --> 04:50.333
‐ Well,
that must've been wonderful.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.958
‐ Yeah.
Right?

04:51.958 --> 04:55.542
Helping all those parents?
All the pain and anxiety?

04:55.542 --> 04:56.583
‐ Yeah.

04:56.583 --> 04:58.542
Delivering their children.

04:58.542 --> 05:02.708
And unlike most city doctors,

05:02.708 --> 05:04.833
you get to watch them grow up.

05:04.833 --> 05:06.833
‐ Yep.
Yep.

05:06.833 --> 05:08.750
‐ Uh‐huh.

05:08.750 --> 05:11.292
‐ You've made some mistakes.

05:11.292 --> 05:14.208
But you've done
some wonderful things, too.

05:16.958 --> 05:19.167
Next session,
I want you to journal about,

05:19.167 --> 05:23.792
uh, what it feels like
to deliver a baby.

05:23.792 --> 05:25.333
Yeah?

05:25.333 --> 05:29.000
And I want you to focus on the
positive things that you did.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.042
We already know
about all your regrets.

05:32.042 --> 05:34.375
I want to hear
about these births.

05:39.292 --> 05:40.292
Samuel?

05:40.292 --> 05:41.542
‐ Yeah.

05:52.583 --> 05:55.042
The Sackler Center
for Arts Education

05:55.042 --> 05:57.000
is one of the most
satisfying things

05:57.000 --> 05:58.500
that our family
has been part of.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.875
I want to thank my brother,
Raymond,

05:59.875 --> 06:02.958
for being here tonight
to celebrate the great work

06:02.958 --> 06:05.375
and the next generation
of artists.

06:06.750 --> 06:10.708
‐ What's the status
with the children's OxyContin?

06:10.708 --> 06:14.208
‐ Still in development,
but coming along nicely.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.500
‐ Hey, cuz.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.583
Hey, congratulations
on another great year.

06:17.583 --> 06:20.042
Sales keep going up.

06:20.042 --> 06:22.167
Yes, David, it's going well.

06:22.167 --> 06:25.792
‐ So a few of us were thinking
of buying a ski resort company.

06:25.792 --> 06:28.000
They've got amazing slopes
all over the country.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.250
And I know how much
you love to ski, so‐‐

06:29.250 --> 06:30.792
‐ Excuse me.

06:30.792 --> 06:34.667
I‐‐I‐‐I have to take this, but
yes, yes, I'm very interested.

06:37.792 --> 06:41.208
Curtis?
Tell me.

06:41.208 --> 06:44.000
It's bad, Dr. Richards.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.333
My intel is from
inside the FDA

06:46.333 --> 06:47.542
and they plan on reviewing

06:47.542 --> 06:49.792
the wording
of the OxyContin label.

06:49.792 --> 06:51.792
And it's very likely
they're gonna change it.

06:51.792 --> 06:53.708
‐ Fuck.
‐ Oh, my God.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.792
‐ But why would the FDA

06:55.792 --> 06:58.667
change our warning label
out of the blue?

06:58.667 --> 07:00.708
‐ Oh, please.
‐ That's enough.

07:00.708 --> 07:02.333
‐ Your son is the only one

07:02.333 --> 07:06.333
unaware that his drug
is a national punching bag.

07:06.333 --> 07:09.583
‐ God damn it, Curtis,
we brought you in from the FDA

07:09.583 --> 07:12.667
to make sure things like this
didn't happen.

07:12.667 --> 07:14.667
‐ That's right.
‐ Look, look, Rich.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.250
Dr. Richard.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.417
The press war
that woman at the DEA started

07:18.417 --> 07:19.792
has had some effect.

07:19.792 --> 07:22.125
There's just too much
bad publicity about the drug

07:22.125 --> 07:24.458
and the FDA
needs to take action.

07:24.458 --> 07:26.958
‐ Curtis, are there
any concessions we can offer

07:26.958 --> 07:28.917
that will prevent them
from changing the label?

07:28.917 --> 07:30.167
‐ Here's an idea.

07:30.167 --> 07:32.083
What if we tell them
we'll pull the 160?

07:32.083 --> 07:34.708
‐ We have invested‐‐
‐ We can try.

07:34.708 --> 07:37.625
‐ But I think our best bet
is to see if we can work out

07:37.625 --> 07:39.375
new language with them.

07:39.375 --> 07:41.042
L‐like the first time.

07:41.042 --> 07:42.583
The wording may
not be as beneficial,

07:42.583 --> 07:44.917
but hopefully
will minimize the damage.

07:44.917 --> 07:47.833
‐ If we have to give up
"addiction is rare,"

07:47.833 --> 07:49.083
sales will plummet.

07:49.083 --> 07:51.792
‐ Let's send a delegation
to meet with the FDA.

07:51.792 --> 07:54.583
I'm sure there are ways
we can aid them

07:54.583 --> 07:57.083
in rewriting this new label.

08:03.292 --> 08:05.708
‐ The good news is
the misbranding case

08:05.708 --> 08:07.000
is open and shut.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.125
Everything we've compiled shows

08:09.125 --> 08:12.000
that Purdue systemically
oversold the benefits

08:12.000 --> 08:13.917
and trivialized
the risks of OxyContin.

08:13.917 --> 08:15.875
But it doesn't put us
over the finish line

08:15.875 --> 08:19.083
'cause we still haven't
charged individuals at the top,

08:19.083 --> 08:21.042
and putting executives
into jail

08:21.042 --> 08:23.583
is truly the most effective way

08:23.583 --> 08:25.958
of deterring companies
from this type of behavior.

08:25.958 --> 08:28.708
‐ You can fine a company,
but you can't put it in jail.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.167
‐ Because a company
feels no pain.

08:31.167 --> 08:33.500
I want Purdue
to feel some pain,

08:33.500 --> 08:35.417
so let's make a final push.

08:35.417 --> 08:36.625
Let's shake every tree.

08:36.625 --> 08:39.500
Financial records, call notes,

08:39.500 --> 08:41.625
applications,
marketing materials.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.708
See if we can find
some hard evidence

08:43.708 --> 08:45.542
against top executives.

08:45.542 --> 08:47.583
Let's go out there and do it.
All right.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.708
Morning, Ms. Moles.

08:52.708 --> 08:55.792
It's Randy Ramseyer, U.S.
Attorney's Office Abingdon.

08:55.792 --> 08:57.417
We talked about four years ago.

08:57.417 --> 08:59.417
‐ Sorry, I'm late for work.

08:59.417 --> 09:02.083
‐ Oh, should we talk
at the FDA instead?

09:02.083 --> 09:04.625
I had a couple questions
about Curtis Wright,

09:04.625 --> 09:08.708
specifically the OxyContin
label that he approved.

09:08.708 --> 09:09.958
You know, actually,

09:09.958 --> 09:12.167
we got a bunch
of unanswered questions

09:12.167 --> 09:14.125
and we're not afraid
to open up our investigation

09:14.125 --> 09:15.833
to individuals
beyond Curtis Wright.

09:15.833 --> 09:16.958
‐ You're referring to me?

09:16.958 --> 09:18.583
‐ I'm referring to anybody
at the FDA

09:18.583 --> 09:21.167
who played a part in that
approval process, ma'am.

09:21.167 --> 09:24.417
We got Purdue sales reps
using that warning label

09:24.417 --> 09:27.750
to sell OxyContin
as basically nonaddictive.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.333
And the guy that approved it
went from working at the FDA

09:30.333 --> 09:34.458
to working for Purdue Pharma
for $379,000 a year.

09:34.458 --> 09:36.625
I mean, it looks to me like

09:36.625 --> 09:38.625
he sold out the health
of the nation.

09:38.625 --> 09:39.958
And I just need to know

09:39.958 --> 09:42.083
if he was promised a job
for that approval.

09:42.083 --> 09:45.000
‐ I have no idea.
I wasn't part of that process.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.375
Now, I have to go to work.

09:50.167 --> 09:51.833
‐ A few years ago,
I had cancer.

09:51.833 --> 09:54.042
And I'm fine now,
but at the time,

09:54.042 --> 09:55.458
when I was in the hospital,

09:55.458 --> 09:58.458
well, I very easily could've
become addicted to Oxy.

09:58.458 --> 10:00.500
And it wouldn't have been
the disease that killed me,

10:00.500 --> 10:02.250
it would've been my medication.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.625
I got lucky.

10:05.625 --> 10:06.625
I just want you to think
of all the kids

10:06.625 --> 10:08.292
that are not getting lucky.

10:11.417 --> 10:13.542
‐ My, uh,
neighbor's kid got hooked.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.375
‐ Please just tell me what you
know about that warning label.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.958
We both know there's
something rotten going on here.

10:23.625 --> 10:26.958
‐ I heard that

10:26.958 --> 10:29.917
about a year
before the drug was approved,

10:29.917 --> 10:33.208
Purdue rented out a hotel suite
in Rockville

10:33.208 --> 10:34.500
down the road from the FDA,

10:34.500 --> 10:37.667
where they meet
with Curtis Wright in private.

10:37.667 --> 10:40.500
Supposedly, Curtis
and the Purdue executives

10:40.500 --> 10:42.958
spent three days together,

10:42.958 --> 10:45.917
working out the wording
of the medical review,

10:45.917 --> 10:48.542
co‐writing the summary
of safety and efficacy.

10:48.542 --> 10:50.125
An FDA employee

10:50.125 --> 10:54.292
literally helped Purdue
write their own review.

10:54.292 --> 10:57.958
‐ Did Curtis Wright pen
the OxyContin warning label

10:57.958 --> 11:00.250
for Purdue?
Did‐‐

11:00.250 --> 11:02.042
did he actually write it?

11:02.042 --> 11:06.167
‐ There is more than one person
that believes that he did.

11:06.167 --> 11:08.917
‐ Do you know who from Purdue
was in that hotel room

11:08.917 --> 11:11.042
with Curtis Wright?
Was it‐‐

11:11.042 --> 11:12.625
was it senior‐level executives?

11:12.625 --> 11:14.750
‐ I'm sorry,
I honestly don't know.

11:14.750 --> 11:18.333
Because if I did,
I would tell you.

11:18.333 --> 11:21.083
Got to go to work.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.333
‐ Have you told any of this
to anybody else before?

11:23.333 --> 11:25.125
No.

11:25.125 --> 11:26.250
‐ Why not?

11:26.250 --> 11:28.042
‐ 'Cause it wouldn't matter
if I did.

11:42.375 --> 11:45.958
There's these flyers
all over town.

11:45.958 --> 11:48.875
A big meeting tomorrow night.

11:48.875 --> 11:52.000
About OxyContin, hmm?
I think we should go.

11:53.417 --> 11:56.250
‐ I don't want people
to see me there.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.708
Then they'll know, Mom.
No.

11:57.708 --> 11:59.667
‐ I don't care what they know.

11:59.667 --> 12:01.958
There might be
some helpful information.

12:01.958 --> 12:05.292
We got to find a way
to get you better, honey.

12:05.292 --> 12:08.625
The real you is still in there.
I just know it.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.792
‐ I don't know
where she's gone.

12:14.792 --> 12:18.292
‐ Well, we got to
find her again, then.

12:18.292 --> 12:19.875
Well?

12:23.917 --> 12:25.917
‐ Okay, Mama.
Okay.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.625
‐ What you got there?

12:41.375 --> 12:44.625
‐ It's for a meeting
about all these drugs.

12:44.625 --> 12:46.167
I know what you're gonna say,

12:46.167 --> 12:48.792
but I don't care
if people know our business.

12:48.792 --> 12:52.250
There's nothing that you
can say to keep me from going.

12:52.250 --> 12:56.583
‐ I‐‐I don't want to stop you
from doing anything, Diane.

12:56.583 --> 12:59.542
You do whatever you need to do.

13:03.542 --> 13:06.958
‐ My name
is Sister Beth Davies.

13:06.958 --> 13:09.792
I want to thank you all
for coming down here.

13:09.792 --> 13:13.083
It's not easy,
as so many of you

13:13.083 --> 13:15.875
are carrying the heavy burden
of a loved one

13:15.875 --> 13:20.292
suffering from this
chronic disease of addiction.

13:20.292 --> 13:22.625
With that said,
I want to introduce you

13:22.625 --> 13:26.792
to the most dedicated
recovery doctor in Appalachia,

13:26.792 --> 13:29.333
Dr. Art Van Zee.

13:33.292 --> 13:35.875
‐ Thank you, Sister Beth.

13:35.875 --> 13:39.375
I know it wasn't easy
for you all to come tonight,

13:39.375 --> 13:42.125
as this addiction
has shame attached to it,

13:42.125 --> 13:46.042
but I hope you all see by this
turnout that you're not alone.

13:46.042 --> 13:49.417
This drug doesn't care
if you're rich or poor,

13:49.417 --> 13:52.417
man or woman,
white, Black, or brown.

13:52.417 --> 13:56.208
Once you've taken too much,
it changes your brain chemistry

13:56.208 --> 13:58.333
so you're in so much pain
without it,

13:58.333 --> 14:01.208
you think you're going to die.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.958
I brought you here tonight
to sign a petition

14:03.958 --> 14:07.208
to ask the FDA to
pull OxyContin from the market

14:07.208 --> 14:11.625
till it can be reformulated
to be resistant to abuse.

14:11.625 --> 14:13.500
It's been done before.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.500
So, after the meeting,
we have tables set up over here

14:16.500 --> 14:18.583
for you
all to sign the petition

14:18.583 --> 14:22.167
so we can try to bring an end
to this nightmare.

14:53.667 --> 14:54.917
I couldn't believe
these results

14:54.917 --> 14:56.000
when I first saw them either,
sir.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.958
I mean‐‐and this is rock solid.

14:57.958 --> 15:01.333
See, the autopsy report proves
overdoses can occur in people

15:01.333 --> 15:03.667
who are taking the drug
exactly as prescribed.

15:03.667 --> 15:05.917
It's not just drug abusers
who are dying.

15:05.917 --> 15:09.000
It's everyday
pain patients, too.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.458
‐ You can't just send out
a press release

15:10.458 --> 15:12.333
without discussing this
with the FDA first.

15:12.333 --> 15:15.083
‐ Okay, but, sir, the press war
I orchestrated last year

15:15.083 --> 15:17.042
is what got the FDA
to take action

15:17.042 --> 15:18.292
against Purdue's warning label.

15:18.292 --> 15:21.125
‐ But if you act without
discussing this with us‐‐

15:21.125 --> 15:22.583
‐ Sir,
with all due respect,

15:22.583 --> 15:25.625
the public needs to have access
to this data ASAP

15:25.625 --> 15:27.250
for their own personal safety.

15:27.250 --> 15:29.750
‐ When do you plan on sharing
your report with the FDA?

15:29.750 --> 15:31.583
‐ I've already set up a meeting
next week

15:31.583 --> 15:33.333
and I've requested Purdue
to be there.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.375
‐ Are you giving Purdue the
report ahead of the meeting?

15:36.375 --> 15:37.833
‐ No.

15:37.833 --> 15:39.792
‐ So you're jamming them
into a fast rebuttal

15:39.792 --> 15:42.583
without being able
to review the report first?

15:42.583 --> 15:43.958
‐ Maybe.

15:43.958 --> 15:45.208
‐ You know you're just going
to piss everyone off.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.958
‐ My goal is to stop
a dangerous drug

15:47.958 --> 15:51.208
from being diverted and abused.

15:51.208 --> 15:53.417
I'm not looking
to make friends.

16:08.208 --> 16:09.333
‐ Excuse me.

16:11.042 --> 16:13.500
Uh, if you don't mind.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.875
If you soak that
in some Epsom salts

16:15.875 --> 16:20.167
and cut the nails
straight across,

16:20.167 --> 16:21.583
that should help that.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.042
‐ Thank you, sir.
I'll‐‐I'll do that.

16:25.042 --> 16:26.917
‐ Sure.
Give it a try.

16:30.208 --> 16:32.125
When you're holding a newborn

16:32.125 --> 16:36.625
and it lets out
the first cry of its life,

16:36.625 --> 16:39.458
your heart can't help
but jump a little.

16:39.458 --> 16:42.458
That's a language
that's as old as those hills.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.792
‐ Bravo.

16:49.708 --> 16:51.458
You know, I'd like
to have you journal next

16:51.458 --> 16:56.083
about, uh, three other people
that you have helped.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.708
Your three proudest moments
as a doctor.

17:01.708 --> 17:03.167
‐ All right.

17:05.417 --> 17:08.125
You know, it sounds crazy,
maybe,

17:08.125 --> 17:11.875
but, uh...

17:11.875 --> 17:15.208
I think a lot about

17:15.208 --> 17:16.708
being a doctor again.

17:16.708 --> 17:18.542
‐ You've never not been
a doctor, Sam,

17:18.542 --> 17:22.292
it's who you will always be.

17:22.292 --> 17:27.500
It's just you need to take
the time to heal yourself.

17:27.500 --> 17:31.042
Right?
It's what I had to do.

17:31.042 --> 17:35.625
I nearly killed a woman and
her young son drunk driving.

17:35.625 --> 17:38.917
Sam, those people walked away
from the wreck that I caused,

17:38.917 --> 17:41.917
but I couldn't walk away
for a long time.

17:41.917 --> 17:45.917
It took me a long time
to forgive myself.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.083
‐ Yeah. I feel like what I did
isn't even forgivable.

17:50.083 --> 17:54.750
I don't‐‐
No. Look.

17:54.750 --> 17:59.167
A way to make amends...

17:59.167 --> 18:02.542
for the pain that we have
caused others is to give back.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.667
And when you're ready,

18:06.667 --> 18:10.500
the greatest thing you can do
is heal others.

18:11.917 --> 18:14.208
So, yes,

18:14.208 --> 18:18.125
begin the process of getting
your medical license back.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.542
‐ Paperwork looks good.

18:22.542 --> 18:24.375
Soon as you've completed
the term of your probation,

18:24.375 --> 18:25.667
we'll get the ball rolling.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.208
‐ Good, good.

18:27.208 --> 18:29.167
‐ It's going to take at least
a year, but it'll be worth it.

18:31.042 --> 18:33.625
There is only one issue I see.

18:33.625 --> 18:36.125
They won't reinstate
your medical license

18:36.125 --> 18:38.167
if you're on methadone.

18:38.167 --> 18:41.000
There's no medical board
in America that would allow it.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.333
Any chance that you'd be done
in a year?

18:43.333 --> 18:47.000
‐ I don't know, to be honest.
Maybe, maybe not.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.875
‐ Well, then you shouldn't
turn in this application

18:48.875 --> 18:50.792
till you're off it.

18:50.792 --> 18:52.667
‐ It's the only thing
keeping me clean.

18:52.667 --> 18:53.792
‐ Well, technically,
you're not.

18:53.792 --> 18:55.000
It's a narcotic.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.792
‐ It's protective.

18:56.792 --> 18:59.208
It protects the way
insulin protects diabetics.

18:59.208 --> 19:01.708
‐ It's banned by physician
plans across the board.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.708
These maintenance medications,
they affect cognition.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.167
‐ That's bullshit.

19:06.167 --> 19:08.667
My thinking hasn't been
this clear in years.

19:08.667 --> 19:10.833
‐ Sir, you can appeal
the decision,

19:10.833 --> 19:13.292
but we've never had
an appeal like this go through.

19:13.292 --> 19:14.917
Good day.

19:20.542 --> 19:23.542
‐ Dr. Cutler, if your patients
report breakthrough pain,

19:23.542 --> 19:24.875
all you have to do
is double their dose

19:24.875 --> 19:26.333
to get them
a full night's sleep.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.250
‐ Isn't, um, breakthrough pain

19:30.250 --> 19:32.917
just a way for you
to sell more Oxy?

19:32.917 --> 19:34.583
Um, not necessarily.

19:34.583 --> 19:36.250
Um, if you look
in the pamphlet‐‐

19:36.250 --> 19:38.167
‐ I heard more milligrams
you write,

19:38.167 --> 19:39.708
bigger your bonus check.

19:39.708 --> 19:42.292
So isn't all this just bullshit
so you can make more money?

19:42.292 --> 19:43.708
I haven't heard of half
the terms in this paper.

19:43.708 --> 19:45.667
‐ Okay, tell you what,
let's take a quick break,

19:45.667 --> 19:48.917
uh, grab some coffee,
be back in ten.

19:52.542 --> 19:53.875
Come on, Miles.

19:56.375 --> 19:59.750
You've seemed unhappy
for a while now.

19:59.750 --> 20:03.542
‐ Yeah, I've been going through
a tough time, you know?

20:03.542 --> 20:05.000
Some‐‐some personal stuff.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.500
‐ Is it girl trouble?
‐ Yeah, yeah.

20:07.500 --> 20:11.375
I'm seeing this chick who's
driving my head in circles.

20:13.417 --> 20:15.958
‐ All right.
Look.

20:18.792 --> 20:22.042
You have got to get your head
back in the game.

20:22.042 --> 20:25.000
You are one of
my best sellers, man.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.250
You're family here.

20:26.250 --> 20:28.875
So whatever you need,
you let me know.

20:28.875 --> 20:30.708
‐ Thanks, Barn.
I appreciate that.

20:35.792 --> 20:38.125
Something interesting
came up.

20:38.125 --> 20:42.375
I've been asked to be
the regional manager

20:42.375 --> 20:47.167
in Louisiana
out of New Orleans.

20:47.167 --> 20:49.792
‐ Wow, holy shit.
That's‐‐

20:49.792 --> 20:51.542
congratulations.
That's great.

20:51.542 --> 20:54.208
New Orleans is a great city.
‐ Thanks.

20:54.208 --> 20:56.167
Um...

20:56.167 --> 21:00.917
and I was thinking
maybe you could come with me?

21:02.958 --> 21:05.125
‐ Uh, how would that work?

21:05.125 --> 21:07.375
I mean, like, as what?

21:07.375 --> 21:10.542
‐ My‐‐my employee.

21:10.542 --> 21:13.833
And, um,

21:13.833 --> 21:15.500
and my boyfriend.

21:17.625 --> 21:19.500
‐ Are you‐‐are you joking?

21:19.500 --> 21:21.958
‐ No.

21:21.958 --> 21:24.875
It's tough being a girl.

21:24.875 --> 21:26.500
You know,
you fuck a guy enough

21:26.500 --> 21:27.958
and then you start
to get attached.

21:27.958 --> 21:29.458
Ugh, it's the worst.

21:30.417 --> 21:32.917
‐ Is that, um‐‐
is that you being sweet?

21:32.917 --> 21:34.458
Fine.

21:36.167 --> 21:39.208
I have feelings for you.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.708
Okay?
You happy now?

21:44.542 --> 21:47.667
‐ I have feelings for you, too.

21:47.667 --> 21:49.792
‐ Wow, I had no idea.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.667
Come to New Orleans.

21:53.667 --> 21:56.417
I'll be the regional manager,

21:56.417 --> 21:59.417
you'll be my star employee.

21:59.417 --> 22:00.833
We can eat beignets,

22:00.833 --> 22:03.292
then you can eat my pussy.

22:03.292 --> 22:06.917
Sounds kind of magical,
doesn't it?

22:06.917 --> 22:10.208
‐ Does sound kind of magical.

22:10.208 --> 22:14.000
‐ Well, you've seemed
a little burned out.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.250
Change is exactly
what you need.

22:18.250 --> 22:21.083
We'll make a fortune there.

22:21.083 --> 22:23.208
It's a booming market.

22:23.208 --> 22:25.833
‐ Ch‐ch, ch‐ch, ch‐ch.

22:25.833 --> 22:27.292
Money, money, money, money.

23:13.250 --> 23:17.833
I'm sorry about the wait.
I'm one of the only doctors

23:17.833 --> 23:21.625
that treats opioid use disorder
in the region.

23:21.625 --> 23:25.583
I'm just grateful
you could see me.

23:25.583 --> 23:27.667
Sister Beth
speaks real highly of you.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.792
‐ And I her.

23:29.792 --> 23:34.833
I believe medication‐assisted
treatment combined with therapy

23:34.833 --> 23:37.708
is the best path to recovery.

23:37.708 --> 23:40.042
I couldn't do this without her.

23:40.042 --> 23:42.417
‐ It's extraordinary
what this drug does.

23:42.417 --> 23:44.625
I still can't get it
out of my mind.

23:44.625 --> 23:48.542
‐ That's because your brain
has been rewired.

23:48.542 --> 23:53.250
And it can take two years for
the frontal lobe to fully heal.

23:53.250 --> 23:57.417
‐ As I understood it,
it wouldn't take that long.

23:57.417 --> 23:58.917
Two years?

23:58.917 --> 24:01.875
I'm afraid that's what
the most recent studies show.

24:01.875 --> 24:04.792
And that's after you stop.

24:07.417 --> 24:10.667
There's a new drug
called Suboxone

24:10.667 --> 24:13.833
that's similar to methadone,
but it's easier to take

24:13.833 --> 24:17.042
because you don't have to go
to a clinic every day.

24:17.042 --> 24:18.375
I can write a prescription.

24:18.375 --> 24:19.958
‐ Is it classified
as a narcotic?

24:19.958 --> 24:24.750
‐ It is, but you might be more
successful in weaning off it.

24:24.750 --> 24:28.583
It can't be done quickly
and the truth is,

24:28.583 --> 24:30.083
some patients will need
to take it

24:30.083 --> 24:31.500
the rest of their lives.

24:33.750 --> 24:37.708
‐ And you don't know that
I'll ever really be off of it?

24:37.708 --> 24:40.000
‐ I don't.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.208
But we can certainly try.

24:44.042 --> 24:45.667
‐ Okay.

24:48.542 --> 24:50.333
Let's give it a shot.

24:50.333 --> 24:52.375
Newt Gingrich has
expressed interest

24:52.375 --> 24:53.625
in running for president.

24:53.625 --> 24:55.375
Certainly a very
interesting guy.

24:55.375 --> 24:57.417
Rudy Giuliani, in fact,

24:57.417 --> 25:00.375
when we look
at the "USA Today"/CNN poll

25:00.375 --> 25:01.750
comes out actually first.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.625
Giuliani would be
the strongest candidate

25:03.625 --> 25:06.042
against Hillary Clinton
because he can‐‐

25:06.042 --> 25:09.917
‐ Bedtime, honey. I want you
to get some sleep tonight.

25:11.083 --> 25:12.792
‐ Yeah, I'll be up in
about 30 minutes.

25:15.333 --> 25:17.583
‐ Look at all
these lovely white people.

25:17.583 --> 25:18.875
Mm.

25:18.875 --> 25:21.583
- These the Sacklers?
- Mm‐hmm.

25:21.583 --> 25:24.750
‐ Well, enough of the Sacklers
for tonight.

25:24.750 --> 25:26.250
Come to bed.

25:28.083 --> 25:30.375
‐ Hey.

25:30.375 --> 25:31.667
Come here.

25:37.625 --> 25:40.875
I'm sorry this case
has been so time‐consuming.

25:42.500 --> 25:45.375
‐ How about you come home
for dinner tomorrow

25:45.375 --> 25:46.708
and play with the kids?

25:46.708 --> 25:48.583
‐ I can't tomorrow.

25:48.583 --> 25:51.208
An opioid abuse doctor is
giving a public presentation.

25:51.208 --> 25:52.417
I need to go it.

25:53.750 --> 25:55.708
‐ Okay, well.

26:02.500 --> 26:04.292
Can‐‐can I go?

26:04.292 --> 26:06.458
‐ Hmm?

26:06.458 --> 26:07.958
Tomorrow, you want to come?

26:07.958 --> 26:11.458
‐ Yeah. I would like
to understand a bit more.

26:11.458 --> 26:14.083
Then you can take me to dinner
afterwards for date night.

26:14.083 --> 26:18.292
All right. You got a deal.

26:18.292 --> 26:19.750
‐ All right.

26:22.208 --> 26:26.875
‐ Five years ago,
when I came to this very gym,

26:26.875 --> 26:28.708
I was naive.

26:28.708 --> 26:31.625
I believed that once Purdue
saw our 10,000 signatures,

26:31.625 --> 26:34.042
they'd reformulate the drug.

26:34.042 --> 26:36.167
But they not only refused,

26:36.167 --> 26:39.292
they pushed even harder
on their marketing.

26:39.292 --> 26:42.458
When I testified in front
of Congress about OxyContin,

26:42.458 --> 26:43.917
I was so nervous,

26:43.917 --> 26:46.792
but I felt I had to personally
warn our government

26:46.792 --> 26:48.667
about what was happening.

26:48.667 --> 26:52.208
And, sadly, they didn't
seem to care, either.

26:52.208 --> 26:53.917
Neither did
the Purdue executives

26:53.917 --> 26:56.417
that were also testifying.

26:56.417 --> 27:01.083
Some senators pushed back
against me, others were bored.

27:01.083 --> 27:02.417
‐ I have to make
a quick phone call.

27:02.417 --> 27:04.833
That's when I knew
this crisis wasn't going

27:04.833 --> 27:07.708
to end anytime soon.
That we all‐‐

27:07.708 --> 27:10.750
‐ Hey, it's me.
When did we last look

27:10.750 --> 27:12.333
at Purdue's
congressional testimony?

27:12.333 --> 27:15.125
‐ That was one of the first
things we did four years ago.

27:15.125 --> 27:17.292
It was all the usual
talking points.

27:17.292 --> 27:19.875
They had no idea of abuse,
all that BS.

27:19.875 --> 27:21.083
‐ Well,
now that we spent years

27:21.083 --> 27:22.583
going through their
internal documents,

27:22.583 --> 27:25.792
maybe it's possible to prove
they were lying to Congress.

27:25.792 --> 27:27.250
‐ Well, Mr. McClosky,

27:27.250 --> 27:28.917
who was the U.S. Attorney
in Maine at the time,

27:28.917 --> 27:30.833
told us when he started
to see problems,

27:30.833 --> 27:33.875
at the very earliest was
the beginning was 2000.

27:33.875 --> 27:36.792
‐ It was in early April
of 2000 that Purdue was‐‐

27:36.792 --> 27:41.833
‐ We didn't learn of the abuse
until March of 2000.

27:41.833 --> 27:45.375
‐ So we have Purdue's
top three executives

27:45.375 --> 27:47.417
all proclaiming to Congress
under oath

27:47.417 --> 27:52.375
that they didn't know the drug
was being abused until 2000,

27:52.375 --> 27:54.417
when US Attorney from Maine,
Jay McClosky‐‐

27:54.417 --> 27:55.792
‐ Who now works for Purdue.

27:55.792 --> 27:57.417
‐ Informs them
that it's being abused.

27:57.417 --> 28:00.667
‐ Okay, got it, so the year
2000 is their official marker?

28:00.667 --> 28:01.833
Yeah.
‐ So what?

28:04.833 --> 28:06.875
Oh, my good God.

28:06.875 --> 28:10.750
Is Rick Mountcastle smiling?
This ought to be good.

28:10.750 --> 28:16.250
‐ So we got numerous
newspaper articles

28:16.250 --> 28:19.708
and emails sent
to these exact guys

28:19.708 --> 28:21.583
that shows that
they were informed of abuse

28:21.583 --> 28:23.417
as early as 1997.

28:23.417 --> 28:26.625
‐ Contradicting
their congressional testimony.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.667
‐ We can charge Purdue's
top three executives

28:31.667 --> 28:35.458
with lying to Congress
and conspiracy to defraud.

28:37.917 --> 28:40.583
‐ Okay.

28:40.583 --> 28:42.750
Let's indict these assholes.

28:42.750 --> 28:44.500
My gut is they're going
to be so scared shitless

28:44.500 --> 28:45.583
of going to prison‐‐

28:45.583 --> 28:47.292
‐ They just might flip
on the Sacklers.

28:47.292 --> 28:50.625
‐ Think they just might.

28:50.625 --> 28:54.917
Well, congratulations, boys.
You just made your case.

29:03.125 --> 29:06.125
‐ I asked you here because
there have been rampant tales

29:06.125 --> 29:08.750
of abuse and diversion
across the country.

29:08.750 --> 29:10.917
The FDA feels
it's time to intervene.

29:10.917 --> 29:13.042
‐ We understand there's been
some diversion,

29:13.042 --> 29:15.167
but changing our warning label
is overly punitive.

29:15.167 --> 29:16.875
It's not the drug
that's the problem,

29:16.875 --> 29:19.542
it's‐‐it's the addicts
who are abusing it.

29:19.542 --> 29:22.708
‐ And, Cynthia, it is not fair
to single us out on this issue.

29:22.708 --> 29:25.875
Endo, Jansen, Teva
are all selling opioids.

29:25.875 --> 29:27.583
You're not changing
their warning labels.

29:27.583 --> 29:29.750
‐ That's because their sales
reps aren't telling doctors

29:29.750 --> 29:31.167
to prescribe
a dangerous narcotic

29:31.167 --> 29:34.583
for wisdom teeth surgery,
or headaches.

29:34.583 --> 29:36.292
‐ Perhaps there are other
actions to be taken

29:36.292 --> 29:38.417
besides something as drastic
as a label change.

29:38.417 --> 29:41.250
There are concessions
we're willing to make.

29:41.250 --> 29:42.792
‐ Like what?

29:42.792 --> 29:45.875
‐ For starters, we'll be taking
the 160 off the market.

29:45.875 --> 29:47.375
‐ I think
you absolutely should.

29:47.375 --> 29:48.458
‐ Right.

29:48.458 --> 29:49.708
‐ But that won't shift
our position

29:49.708 --> 29:51.542
on the warning label.
It will be changed.

29:51.542 --> 29:52.667
We're seriously considering

29:52.667 --> 29:53.917
giving you
the black box warning.

29:56.792 --> 29:58.167
‐ They what?

29:58.167 --> 30:02.750
‐ They might add a black box
warning to the new label.

30:02.750 --> 30:04.417
‐ That's the worst thing
that could happen

30:04.417 --> 30:05.667
except for a recall.

30:05.667 --> 30:08.333
‐ I know, I know, Dad.
Okay? I know.

30:12.792 --> 30:15.167
‐ Well, you finally did it.

30:15.167 --> 30:17.667
You flew too close to the sun.

30:17.667 --> 30:22.208
‐ Yeah.
I bet you're happy now.

30:22.208 --> 30:23.958
‐ Excuse me?

30:23.958 --> 30:27.708
‐ Oh,
it must've been difficult,

30:27.708 --> 30:31.750
see your son more successful
than you ever were.

30:31.750 --> 30:36.167
You only had this company
because of Arthur.

30:36.167 --> 30:39.708
Everything anyone has in this
family is because of Arthur.

30:39.708 --> 30:43.000
It all came from his brain.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.875
And all you could ever do
is sell Betadine.

30:46.875 --> 30:51.042
Then I finally did something.
Me.

30:51.042 --> 30:55.083
And it was bigger than anything
you or Arthur ever dreamed of.

30:55.083 --> 30:58.292
‐ Oh, but you seem to be
missing a key difference

30:58.292 --> 30:59.875
between you and Arthur.

30:59.875 --> 31:02.583
‐ What's that?

31:02.583 --> 31:05.875
‐ He never would've gotten
a black box warning.

31:09.292 --> 31:10.667
SENATOR Dr. Sackler,

31:10.667 --> 31:14.042
the "Journal of the
American Medical Association"

31:14.042 --> 31:15.833
thought you misstated the facts

31:15.833 --> 31:18.500
by overstating
the effectiveness of the drug

31:18.500 --> 31:20.750
and understating
the side effects.

31:20.750 --> 31:23.000
You complied with their request

31:23.000 --> 31:24.875
by making edits
on the advertisement

31:24.875 --> 31:27.333
which then got the ad approved,

31:27.333 --> 31:31.708
but then you went on
and printed the original ad

31:31.708 --> 31:35.375
with the misstated facts
in other journals.

31:35.375 --> 31:38.417
‐ Senator, the
"Annals of Internal Medicine,"

31:38.417 --> 31:42.042
with an eminent board,
accepted these opinions.

31:42.042 --> 31:44.417
"The Journal of the American
Medical Association,"

31:44.417 --> 31:48.125
with an equally prominent
board, did not accept them.

31:48.125 --> 31:51.250
Therefore, what we were
dealing with here

31:51.250 --> 31:57.083
was a difference of opinion,
not a misstatement of facts.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.333
‐ Perhaps...

32:06.333 --> 32:10.417
this could potentially create

32:10.417 --> 32:12.167
an opportunity for us.

32:12.167 --> 32:15.750
Why not ask
if the label could say

32:15.750 --> 32:18.333
the drug can be used

32:18.333 --> 32:21.792
for an extended period
of time?

32:21.792 --> 32:24.042
‐ You really think the FDA
would allow that?

32:24.042 --> 32:25.583
Come on.

32:25.583 --> 32:27.500
I'm worried that they're going
to pull all the language

32:27.500 --> 32:29.667
about the drug
being less addictive.

32:29.667 --> 32:31.583
‐ Yeah, I am too.

32:31.583 --> 32:34.833
‐ Fighting to keep
"less addictive" is crucial,

32:34.833 --> 32:36.833
but we need to give
a little to do it.

32:36.833 --> 32:39.375
Right now, the label says
"addiction is rare,"

32:39.375 --> 32:43.125
so maybe we offer, "addiction
is reported to be rare."

32:43.125 --> 32:44.625
‐ That's not bad.

32:44.625 --> 32:47.042
‐ We need to be able to keep
prescribing for moderate pain.

32:47.042 --> 32:50.667
‐ What about
"extended period of time"?

32:50.667 --> 32:53.458
That could turn
this whole fiasco

32:53.458 --> 32:56.542
into a financial win because

32:56.542 --> 33:00.708
patients will be on it
for longer periods.

33:00.708 --> 33:03.333
Perhaps indefinitely.
Mm.

33:03.333 --> 33:06.417
I just think it'll be
a bridge too far for the FDA.

33:06.417 --> 33:08.958
‐ But it's possible
they won't be aware

33:08.958 --> 33:11.667
of exactly
what they'd be giving us.

33:11.667 --> 33:15.583
And if they're going to slap us
with a black box warning,

33:15.583 --> 33:17.750
they should at least
give us something.

33:48.417 --> 33:49.625
‐ Hello?

33:49.625 --> 33:52.583
Hey, Bets,
this is Sam Finnix.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.708
‐ I thought you were dead.

33:56.708 --> 34:01.167
No, no.
I'm still fighting this thing.

34:02.917 --> 34:05.208
‐ Me, too.

34:05.208 --> 34:07.833
Bets...

34:07.833 --> 34:12.542
I'm so sorry I ever
prescribed that drug for you.

34:12.542 --> 34:16.208
I never would've done it
if I thought it would hurt you.

34:16.208 --> 34:20.042
I promise you I didn't know.

34:20.042 --> 34:22.042
‐ Of course you didn't.

34:22.042 --> 34:24.167
That company's been lying
to everybody.

34:24.167 --> 34:26.667
Listen, I'm going to tell
you why I called you.

34:26.667 --> 34:30.292
I've been seeing this doctor
in a clinic in Jonesville.

34:30.292 --> 34:33.333
He's‐‐he's started me on
this new drug

34:33.333 --> 34:36.417
that, uh, has helped me.

34:36.417 --> 34:39.583
I mean, my cravings are
way, way down.

34:39.583 --> 34:40.792
‐ Well, what is it?

34:40.792 --> 34:42.583
‐ It's called Suboxone.

34:42.583 --> 34:45.833
It's like methadone,
which also helped,

34:45.833 --> 34:48.625
but this, for me,
is way, way better.

34:48.625 --> 34:52.750
‐ I've heard about them.
And they really work?

34:52.750 --> 34:56.375
‐ Well, it does for me.
It's just, you know,

34:56.375 --> 35:00.708
it's damn hard to get off
this junk without medicine.

35:00.708 --> 35:03.042
‐ Yeah.

35:03.042 --> 35:05.292
It's been impossible.

35:05.292 --> 35:08.208
And I've been really trying.

35:08.208 --> 35:10.875
I know you have, Betsy.

35:10.875 --> 35:12.833
And listen to this.

35:12.833 --> 35:16.208
I want to drive you
to this clinic.

35:16.208 --> 35:18.500
It's about an hour
from your place.

35:18.500 --> 35:21.875
I will drive you there
and back every week.

35:21.875 --> 35:23.750
What do you think?

35:26.375 --> 35:28.042
‐ Um.

35:30.417 --> 35:33.417
Let me think about it.

35:33.417 --> 35:34.500
Hey.

35:34.500 --> 35:37.875
I'm just so damn sorry, Betsy.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.833
‐ Hey, Doc?
Yeah?

35:47.708 --> 35:49.083
‐ I love you.

35:55.583 --> 35:57.208
‐ I love you, too.

36:05.375 --> 36:07.125
‐ They're narcotics.

36:07.125 --> 36:10.083
You're just trading in one drug
for another one.

36:10.083 --> 36:12.833
They're dangerous and addictive
in their own way.

36:12.833 --> 36:15.750
‐ Nothing has worked
for my girl.

36:15.750 --> 36:20.500
We brought her here and people
sold her drugs in the bathroom.

36:20.500 --> 36:24.792
‐ And that was a grotesque
aberration of our trust.

36:24.792 --> 36:26.708
But if you take
these so‐called medications,

36:26.708 --> 36:29.875
you're not placing your trust
in a higher power.

36:29.875 --> 36:33.042
You're just putting it
into more drugs.

36:33.042 --> 36:34.583
‐ So they don't work?

36:34.583 --> 36:38.250
‐ No, they don't.
I'm sorry.

36:49.458 --> 36:50.875
‐ Mom.

36:53.833 --> 36:56.417
I don't believe
in a higher power.

36:56.417 --> 36:57.875
I only believe in heroin.

36:57.875 --> 37:01.583
‐ Bets, don't say that!

37:01.583 --> 37:04.833
Now, you heard the man.

37:04.833 --> 37:07.000
These medications could be
just as dangerous

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
as the one that got you hooked
in the first place.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.792
‐ I've got to try something.

37:14.792 --> 37:16.958
I miss who I was.

37:16.958 --> 37:22.083
This is‐‐it's not me.

37:22.083 --> 37:25.417
All right?

37:25.417 --> 37:27.333
It never has been.

37:41.167 --> 37:44.208
‐ I heard you that night,

37:44.208 --> 37:46.458
when you told me
you liked girls.

37:48.542 --> 37:52.500
And I've been killing myself
for years I didn't say nothing.

37:54.167 --> 37:57.000
I feel like this all happened

37:57.000 --> 37:59.708
because I stayed quiet
that night.

38:01.208 --> 38:05.583
‐ It didn't.

38:05.583 --> 38:07.417
I promise you.

38:07.417 --> 38:10.500
‐ I think maybe it did.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.333
Even just a little.

38:15.417 --> 38:18.667
And I want you to know
that when you're better,

38:18.667 --> 38:21.875
I want you
to have a girlfriend.

38:21.875 --> 38:25.083
And I'll cook you both dinner
and breakfast

38:25.083 --> 38:27.542
and anything you two want.

38:31.667 --> 38:33.583
‐ That sounds real nice.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.458
I got to get better first.

38:43.750 --> 38:45.500
I want to do this.

38:51.208 --> 38:53.625
‐ Okay, Betsy.
I don't‐‐

38:55.042 --> 39:00.583
Okay, we'll take you to
the clinic and give it a try.

39:07.583 --> 39:08.708
Here he comes.

39:15.208 --> 39:16.542
‐ Sir.
‐ Thank you.

39:16.542 --> 39:20.000
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Okay. Thanks.

39:25.917 --> 39:29.583
As we suspected...

39:29.583 --> 39:32.833
the FDA ordered a label change

39:32.833 --> 39:37.583
and that label will have
a black box warning on it.

39:37.583 --> 39:39.542
We're so fucked.

39:39.542 --> 39:43.333
‐ Not necessarily.

39:43.333 --> 39:46.125
There are a few surprises here.

39:46.125 --> 39:48.875
It says on page three

39:48.875 --> 39:52.083
the label is approved to say,

39:52.083 --> 39:55.083
"addiction is reported
to be rare."

39:55.083 --> 39:56.958
‐ Really?
That's huge.

39:56.958 --> 40:01.250
‐ And we're still allowed to
keep selling for moderate pain.

40:01.250 --> 40:02.958
‐ Thank God.

40:02.958 --> 40:04.667
It would've ended us if we
were restricted to severe pain.

40:04.667 --> 40:05.917
‐ Oh, 100%.

40:05.917 --> 40:07.333
‐ There's one more
big surprise.

40:09.625 --> 40:14.083
The FDA has agreed
to let us say...

40:14.083 --> 40:19.375
the drug can be used
for an extended period of time.

40:22.292 --> 40:23.750
‐ You gotta be kidding.
No, I'm not.

40:23.750 --> 40:25.375
‐ What?

40:25.375 --> 40:26.833
‐ We can now tell doctors

40:26.833 --> 40:29.833
OxyContin is safe to use
indefinitely.

40:29.833 --> 40:32.792
‐ Well done, son.
Well done.

40:32.792 --> 40:35.583
‐ How the fuck
did we pull this off?

40:35.583 --> 40:37.708
‐ Yeah, when we discussed it
with the FDA,

40:37.708 --> 40:39.208
they seemed open to it.

40:39.208 --> 40:40.708
I mean, Dr. Richard was right.

40:40.708 --> 40:42.333
I don't think
they fully understood

40:42.333 --> 40:43.875
the true ramifications of,

40:43.875 --> 40:45.333
you know, what this wording
would do.

40:45.333 --> 40:48.875
‐ Oh, my God, I can't believe
how lucky we got.

40:48.875 --> 40:54.667
‐ It's luck
with a little bit of a push.

40:54.667 --> 40:56.250
Marketing has
already run numbers

40:56.250 --> 40:58.583
and with this new language,

40:58.583 --> 41:03.208
they think we can triple
our sales in two years.

41:08.042 --> 41:09.458
‐ Look, with this new language,

41:09.458 --> 41:11.083
it's not even
really a black box warning,

41:11.083 --> 41:14.250
it's more like black box lite,

41:14.250 --> 41:15.625
and that is exactly

41:15.625 --> 41:17.042
what you need to be telling
your doctors.

41:17.042 --> 41:19.167
‐ I don't understand that.
‐ What?

41:19.167 --> 41:23.208
‐ A black box label indicates
the drug is much more dangerous

41:23.208 --> 41:24.958
than we've been telling doctors
for years.

41:24.958 --> 41:26.458
‐ Absolutely not.

41:26.458 --> 41:28.917
The new label itself says
that it can be used

41:28.917 --> 41:32.292
for extended periods of time.

41:32.292 --> 41:33.750
How dangerous can it be?

41:33.750 --> 41:35.958
And as far as the black box
itself goes,

41:35.958 --> 41:38.375
if it comes up,
you tell your doctors

41:38.375 --> 41:41.625
that it is an "exercise
in graphic design."

41:41.625 --> 41:42.833
Yeah.

41:42.833 --> 41:46.083
‐ I may be mistaken here,
but this new label

41:46.083 --> 41:49.042
gives us leeway
to be even more aggressive now.

41:49.042 --> 41:50.375
‐ Fuck yeah it does!

41:50.375 --> 41:52.333
‐ The bosses think
that we can double,

41:52.333 --> 41:54.333
maybe triple sales
with this new wording.

42:34.167 --> 42:35.167
‐ What are you doing?

42:35.167 --> 42:37.792
‐ Hey, I, uh, came to find you.

42:37.792 --> 42:39.833
I'm not feeling too good.

42:39.833 --> 42:43.292
I was going to ask you
if I can take off.

42:43.292 --> 42:45.042
‐ That thing we talked
about earlier?

42:45.042 --> 42:47.208
‐ Yeah, yeah.

42:47.208 --> 42:51.792
‐ Okay.
‐ Thanks.

42:51.792 --> 42:53.542
‐ Billy?
‐ Yeah.

42:53.542 --> 42:55.292
‐ Don't let a piece of ass
fuck up a career

42:55.292 --> 42:57.250
that's about to get
a lot more lucrative.

42:57.250 --> 42:59.250
‐ Thank you.
I won't.

42:59.250 --> 43:01.542
Okay.

43:09.958 --> 43:12.875
This is an exhaustive
DEA autopsy study

43:12.875 --> 43:16.500
that demonstrates
the dangers of OxyContin

43:16.500 --> 43:19.208
when taken as prescribed.

43:19.208 --> 43:21.375
‐ I've asked Deborah Leiderman,

43:21.375 --> 43:23.167
the FDA's controlled
substances director,

43:23.167 --> 43:27.375
to join us since we didn't get
the report ahead of time.

43:27.375 --> 43:29.917
I thought her expertise
would be necessary.

43:29.917 --> 43:33.375
‐ Of course.
‐ Thank you.

43:33.375 --> 43:35.708
‐ DEA pharmacologist
David Govin

43:35.708 --> 43:37.583
will now take you
through the data

43:37.583 --> 43:43.083
which was derived
from 1,304 autopsies.

43:44.958 --> 43:46.458
‐ To start off,

43:46.458 --> 43:51.083
we uncovered that 98% of our
verified OxyContin user deaths

43:51.083 --> 43:52.875
were not drug abusers

43:52.875 --> 43:56.042
who crushed and then snorted
or injected the drug.

43:56.042 --> 44:01.167
They had simply swallowed it,
as approved by the FDA.

44:01.167 --> 44:04.458
We know this to be true because
we had photographs of the pills

44:04.458 --> 44:09.125
intact in their stomachs
at the time of autopsy.

44:09.125 --> 44:11.167
‐ It's not possible
to determine

44:11.167 --> 44:12.750
OxyContin‐verified deaths

44:12.750 --> 44:16.208
since the toxicology reports
usually do not list

44:16.208 --> 44:19.625
exact levels of the other drugs
at the time of death.

44:19.625 --> 44:21.792
‐ The DEA marked a death
as OxyContin‐verified

44:21.792 --> 44:24.292
only if the level of OxyContin
in the bloodstream

44:24.292 --> 44:26.917
was high enough to be deadly
on its own.

44:26.917 --> 44:29.625
‐ Assuming the measurements
were accurate,

44:29.625 --> 44:30.625
how do we know that?

44:30.625 --> 44:31.917
‐ Why would they be inaccurate?

44:31.917 --> 44:34.667
The data came directly
from the autopsy reports.

44:34.667 --> 44:36.417
And we only counted
drug combinations

44:36.417 --> 44:38.167
with tranquilizers
and anti‐depressants,

44:38.167 --> 44:40.125
drugs commonly prescribed
with OxyContin

44:40.125 --> 44:41.958
to reduce anxiety
amongst pain patients.

44:41.958 --> 44:43.292
‐ In all likelihood,

44:43.292 --> 44:45.875
we undercounted the number
of OxyContin overdoses

44:45.875 --> 44:48.958
out of an abundance of caution
for accuracy.

44:48.958 --> 44:51.292
‐ Okay, okay.
First of all,

44:51.292 --> 44:54.333
Purdue had not been given
access to this data in advance,

44:54.333 --> 44:56.792
making it impossible for us
to uncover errors

44:56.792 --> 44:58.792
made by
these medical examiners.

44:58.792 --> 45:02.833
‐ And at first glance,
the science appears to me

45:02.833 --> 45:06.083
as rudimentary
and overly simplistic.

45:06.083 --> 45:07.667
If we had more time to respond,

45:07.667 --> 45:09.917
we could make crystal clear
how far off they are.

45:09.917 --> 45:11.000
Absolutely.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.917
‐ This study is exhaustive...

45:13.917 --> 45:16.875
thorough...conservative.

45:19.042 --> 45:20.542
‐ Deborah?

45:28.292 --> 45:30.875
‐ I tend to agree
with Purdue on this.

45:30.875 --> 45:34.875
These autopsy reports
are inconclusive at this point.

45:34.875 --> 45:38.292
Or at least not as definitive
as the DEA has presented them.

45:38.292 --> 45:41.542
And our own data does not
underscore the DEA's analysis,

45:41.542 --> 45:45.042
which to be honest,
I also find ambiguous.

45:45.042 --> 45:48.042
Based on this study alone,

45:48.042 --> 45:50.083
I don't find
any cause for panic.

45:50.083 --> 45:51.458
‐ Great, great.

45:51.458 --> 45:54.250
‐ So you're just going
to ignore the results?

45:54.250 --> 45:57.167
‐ I'm not ignoring them.
I'm disagreeing with them.

45:57.167 --> 46:00.000
The FDA changed
the warning label a year ago

46:00.000 --> 46:01.750
and gave it
a black box warning,

46:01.750 --> 46:04.333
which was a harsh rebuke.
And appropriate.

46:04.333 --> 46:05.667
‐ Yes.

46:05.667 --> 46:08.250
‐ But on this autopsy issue,
I side with Purdue.

46:08.250 --> 46:10.000
‐ And we completely agree.
Thank you, Doctor.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.750
Cynthia. Thank you.
Thank you, Cynthia.

46:21.333 --> 46:24.625
‐ Can't fucking believe it.

46:24.625 --> 46:28.750
Oh, I just‐‐I can't believe it.

46:28.750 --> 46:31.250
Do you think that she was
on the take?

46:31.250 --> 46:33.875
That she intentionally
sabotaged our investigation?

46:33.875 --> 46:35.375
‐ Well, maybe she just
doesn't like you.

46:35.375 --> 46:38.667
‐ Are you kidding?
‐ No, I'm not.

46:38.667 --> 46:40.667
You shouldn't have gone
to the press first.

46:40.667 --> 46:43.167
You should've given them all
the report before the meeting.

46:43.167 --> 46:45.625
‐ Yeah, and then they would've
coordinated a response.

46:45.625 --> 46:47.042
‐ Bridget, Bridget.

46:47.042 --> 46:48.708
Leiderman and McCormick
don't need to be on the take

46:48.708 --> 46:49.958
to side with Purdue.

46:49.958 --> 46:51.000
You don't have to look
any further

46:51.000 --> 46:52.542
than Curtis Wright's new salary

46:52.542 --> 46:55.458
to know why the FDA
almost always sides with them.

47:05.417 --> 47:08.417
‐ They're just being friendly
to a potential future employer.

47:11.375 --> 47:13.667
That's all this is, isn't it?

47:17.208 --> 47:20.125
Hey.

47:20.125 --> 47:22.250
I thought‐‐
I thought we'd celebrate.

47:26.250 --> 47:29.458
‐ I lost.

47:29.458 --> 47:31.625
The FDA sided with Purdue.

47:31.625 --> 47:33.333
‐ Are you serious?

47:33.333 --> 47:38.750
‐ They said our data wasn't
conclusive, which it was.

47:42.750 --> 47:47.042
The FDA just blew their shot
to end the opioid crisis.

47:47.042 --> 47:48.833
‐ Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God,

47:48.833 --> 47:52.292
I'm so sorry.
Oh, honey.

47:56.333 --> 47:59.125
Come here.
Come on, let's sit down.

48:04.542 --> 48:09.208
Look, this has been‐‐

48:09.208 --> 48:11.708
this has been on my mind
for a long time.

48:11.708 --> 48:14.750
And this just confirms
what I've been thinking.

48:19.167 --> 48:21.750
Your job's
destroying your life.

48:21.750 --> 48:25.417
And I don't think that
they even appreciate it.

48:25.417 --> 48:26.875
I know that this is hard,

48:26.875 --> 48:32.667
but have you thought maybe
about doing something else?

48:32.667 --> 48:34.167
In an unrelated field.

48:34.167 --> 48:35.917
Just get away
from these people.

48:35.917 --> 48:38.333
‐ Okay, uh,
this isn't destroying my life.

48:38.333 --> 48:42.292
It is my life.
I love what I do.

48:42.292 --> 48:44.667
‐ We can't go on together
living like this.

48:51.292 --> 48:56.667
‐ My goal in life is...

48:56.667 --> 48:59.083
not just to be your wife.

49:04.208 --> 49:06.083
‐ You know what, I know
that your work is important.

49:06.083 --> 49:09.125
I know that what you do
is important.

49:09.125 --> 49:10.833
I just want to be important
to you as well.

49:14.333 --> 49:16.917
We got married
kind of late in life.

49:16.917 --> 49:19.750
And it was supposed
to make us happy.

49:22.333 --> 49:24.708
I don't think
either of us is happy.

49:50.542 --> 49:52.542
‐ Hi, Alice.

49:52.542 --> 49:53.833
‐ Hi, John.

49:53.833 --> 49:55.917
‐ This is Rick Mountcastle
and Randy Ramseyer.

49:55.917 --> 49:57.333
They've been running point
on this case.

49:57.333 --> 50:00.583
This is Alice Fisher,
head of the criminal division.

50:00.583 --> 50:02.542
‐ A pleasure. I hear you've
been doing great work.

50:02.542 --> 50:04.042
- Nice to meet you.
- So, I'm curious.

50:05.458 --> 50:07.792
If anyone hires Rudy Giuliani,
Howard Shapiro,

50:07.792 --> 50:09.167
and Mary Jo White,

50:09.167 --> 50:10.792
do they get a special audience
with the DOJ

50:10.792 --> 50:12.333
to plead their case

50:12.333 --> 50:14.667
or is that just billionaires
with their names on museums?

50:14.667 --> 50:15.958
‐ That's cute, John.

50:17.583 --> 50:19.417
‐ No, it is total bullshit

50:19.417 --> 50:20.958
that we're even
taking this meeting.

50:20.958 --> 50:23.125
And I hear Giuliani is lobbying
everyone in the building

50:23.125 --> 50:24.792
not to charge these guys
with felonies.

50:24.792 --> 50:28.542
‐ Okay, the former mayor
does not influence the DOJ.

50:28.542 --> 50:31.625
Let's just hear what they have
to say and go from there.

50:35.708 --> 50:38.083
‐ We can provide hundreds
of internal emails

50:38.083 --> 50:40.000
to show how surprised
these executives were

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
if there had been abuse
prior to the year 2000.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.958
Yes, there had been
random incidences,

50:45.958 --> 50:47.833
but all narcotic
prescription drugs

50:47.833 --> 50:50.958
get abused to a certain extent.
And there were no warning signs

50:50.958 --> 50:53.042
that OxyContin
had reached unusual levels.

50:53.042 --> 50:56.458
And it would be highly
inappropriate and overzealous

50:56.458 --> 50:58.917
to charge individual executives
with felonies

50:58.917 --> 51:01.542
for the actions
of a few rogue sales reps.

51:04.583 --> 51:06.375
‐ Well, it's been
about a few hours.

51:06.375 --> 51:08.083
I'd hate to get
too overzealous.

51:08.083 --> 51:09.708
Why don't we take
a quick break?

51:13.333 --> 51:15.500
‐ Come to my office.

51:21.125 --> 51:23.292
They have a legitimate defense.

51:23.292 --> 51:25.375
‐ No.
No, they don't.

51:25.375 --> 51:28.167
Those are just their standard
talking points‐‐it's bullshit.

51:28.167 --> 51:30.208
‐ That doesn't mean
they won't sway a jury.

51:30.208 --> 51:33.042
‐ Look, these guys dropped
this drug in my community,

51:33.042 --> 51:34.458
they addicted
thousands of people,

51:34.458 --> 51:36.125
and then they walked away
with billions.

51:36.125 --> 51:37.375
They will either plead guilty

51:37.375 --> 51:38.750
or they'll be convicted
by a jury.

51:38.750 --> 51:40.125
I've got a great case here.

51:40.125 --> 51:42.875
‐ It's a case
that still has risks.

51:42.875 --> 51:44.875
Come in.

51:53.375 --> 51:55.083
I don't think you're gonna
find main Justice

51:55.083 --> 51:57.792
will support felony charges
against these executives.

52:00.250 --> 52:02.542
‐ Well, it's not your call.

52:02.542 --> 52:04.792
And I don't report to you,
so I'll make my own decisions.

52:04.792 --> 52:07.083
‐ I know it's not my call.

52:07.083 --> 52:08.917
And you're correct.

52:08.917 --> 52:12.875
I have no decision‐making power
over charging.

52:15.208 --> 52:16.542
‐ Sorry, are you saying that

52:16.542 --> 52:19.375
this is coming from
the deputy attorney general?

52:19.375 --> 52:23.000
‐ I don't believe you will
find support at main Justice

52:23.000 --> 52:26.917
for felony charges
against these individuals.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.292
‐ Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen,

52:53.292 --> 52:54.792
if I could have your attention.

52:54.792 --> 52:56.667
Thank you so much
for your lengthy presentation.

52:56.667 --> 52:58.000
After careful consideration,

52:58.000 --> 53:00.125
I have decided to indict
Michael Friedman,

53:00.125 --> 53:02.958
Paul Goldenheim, and
Howard Udell on felony charges.

53:02.958 --> 53:04.000
Have a great day.

53:09.750 --> 53:12.500
‐ So how is this going to work
if they won't let us indict?

53:17.500 --> 53:19.458
‐ I have no idea.

53:24.333 --> 53:28.375
Hello?

53:28.375 --> 53:32.375
‐ Hey, Grace, it's Betsy.

53:32.375 --> 53:36.167
‐ Hey.
How are you doing?

53:36.167 --> 53:41.042
‐ Oh, I'm‐‐I'm good.

53:41.042 --> 53:46.875
I think I'm finally getting
a handle on all this mess.

53:46.875 --> 53:48.333
‐ Well, that's great.

53:51.292 --> 53:53.917
‐ How's Eureka Springs?
Oh, you'd love it.

53:53.917 --> 53:55.875
It's um‐‐

53:55.875 --> 53:57.500
it's like Oz
for country queers.

54:02.542 --> 54:06.917
‐ I'd‐‐I'd love
to come by sometime.

54:06.917 --> 54:09.167
Oh, yeah, you should.

54:09.167 --> 54:11.250
Ah, it'd be great to see you.

54:11.250 --> 54:14.917
Hey, uh...

54:14.917 --> 54:19.708
do you think that‐‐
maybe that when I'm better...

54:21.875 --> 54:25.042
we could, uh...

54:25.042 --> 54:28.208
try again?

54:28.208 --> 54:29.792
Start over?

54:31.875 --> 54:35.375
‐ Um...

54:35.375 --> 54:38.375
I don't think
that would work.

54:38.375 --> 54:42.167
But, uh,
I'd sure love to be friends.

54:51.333 --> 54:55.458
‐ Yeah.
I‐‐

54:55.458 --> 54:56.750
I understand.

54:59.125 --> 55:01.083
Be real nice to be friends.

55:05.542 --> 55:08.083
Uh...

55:08.083 --> 55:10.542
take care, Grace.

55:10.542 --> 55:12.417
‐ You too, Bets.

55:36.208 --> 55:39.000
It's been a while
since I've seen you.

55:39.000 --> 55:44.125
‐ Yeah, well, I'm starting
Suboxone tomorrow.

55:44.125 --> 55:48.833
So...give me one hell
of a sendoff.

55:48.833 --> 55:50.375
You got it.

57:34.667 --> 57:37.458
‐ I'm so sorry, Diane.
I'm so sorry.

58:30.833 --> 58:32.250
Hello?

58:32.250 --> 58:38.292
‐ Hey, Diane, it's Sam Finnix.
I'm just waiting here.

58:38.292 --> 58:40.625
You and Betsy
are still coming, right?

58:42.833 --> 58:46.625
I'm sorry,
but Betsy's in heaven now.

58:50.958 --> 58:53.125
My girl is finally out
of her pain.

58:54.208 --> 58:55.667
‐ That‐‐

59:24.542 --> 59:27.542
New medicines
are changing the world.

59:27.542 --> 59:31.375
They can cure diseases
once thought incurable.

59:31.375 --> 59:33.542
They can bring joy...

59:33.542 --> 59:36.250
where there was
once only pain.

59:36.250 --> 59:40.625
It has truly been an honor to
testify before this committee

59:40.625 --> 59:45.292
on a subject that means
so much to me and my family.

59:45.292 --> 59:48.833
And I'd like to leave you with
one very important thought.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.708
No laws or regulations

59:54.708 --> 59:59.875
will ever be able
to stop the miracle

59:59.875 --> 1:00:02.083
that is modern pharmaceuticals.

1:00:04.250 --> 1:00:05.792
Thank you.

1:00:11.208 --> 1:00:13.625
The record speaks for itself.
