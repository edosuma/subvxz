00:27.540 --> 00:29.098
I want Michael Knight!

00:29.175 --> 00:31.769
He's standing between us
and Devon and April.

00:31.844 --> 00:33.539
Goliath is invulnerable.

00:33.613 --> 00:35.979
If you please me,
I may have you spared.

00:38.685 --> 00:40.448
Please,
he can't hurt you now!

00:40.553 --> 00:42.350
Devon Miles must die.

00:43.856 --> 00:45.790
Who are you?
Where's my uncle?

00:47.026 --> 00:48.618
Michael, we're out of control.

00:48.695 --> 00:49.753
Reverse turbo!

00:49.829 --> 00:51.490
Malfunction.

01:05.411 --> 01:08.107
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight

01:08.181 --> 01:10.240
into the dangerous world
of a man

01:10.349 --> 01:12.510
who does not exist.

01:18.825 --> 01:20.690
Michael Knight, a young loner

01:20.760 --> 01:23.320
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:23.396 --> 01:25.455
the helpless, the powerless,

01:25.531 --> 01:28.728
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

03:31.324 --> 03:33.519
Let's go! Come on! Let's go!

03:38.798 --> 03:39.787
Push!

04:12.031 --> 04:13.396
What's that noise?

04:13.699 --> 04:15.030
What's going on here?

04:15.101 --> 04:17.069
I don't know what that is?

04:31.817 --> 04:34.684
Is that an
airplane or what? I don't know.

04:48.534 --> 04:51.094
Get your
hands off me, man. Come on!

06:21.660 --> 06:24.788
All right, KITT,
let's try April's new device.

06:24.864 --> 06:26.798
Michael, I have
serious reservations

06:26.866 --> 06:27.958
about this.

06:28.034 --> 06:29.524
Hang on, buddy,

06:29.969 --> 06:32.733
and get ready to
make like a bird.

06:44.650 --> 06:46.777
Michael, the release mechanism
is malfunctioning.

06:46.886 --> 06:48.513
Abort! Abort!

06:59.131 --> 07:01.361
That's just too close
for comfort.

07:01.434 --> 07:03.265
You can say that again.

07:04.703 --> 07:07.501
Looks like it's back
to the drawing board, huh?

07:11.010 --> 07:13.444
I'll have it
fixed in 15 minutes.

07:13.946 --> 07:15.641
Take a half an hour.

07:15.781 --> 07:17.646
Just make sure
it's perfect, okay?

07:18.117 --> 07:20.085
Better yet, take an hour.

07:20.553 --> 07:23.113
Will you relax?
I know what I'm doing.

07:23.222 --> 07:25.053
And I know what I'm not doing.

07:25.124 --> 07:26.091
What's that, KITT?

07:26.192 --> 07:28.023
I'm not going
near another cliff.

07:28.094 --> 07:29.686
Teetering on the edge
of oblivion

07:29.762 --> 07:31.821
has spoiled my appetite
for heights.

07:32.965 --> 07:34.523
Don't worry, KITT.

07:34.667 --> 07:36.259
There's been a change
in the menu.

07:36.335 --> 07:39.532
It's canapes and croissants
for the next few days.

07:39.872 --> 07:42.966
I assume you've both heard
of Dr. Klaus Bergstrom.

07:43.042 --> 07:44.202
Who hasn't?

07:44.276 --> 07:46.608
His research
in satellite laser technology

07:46.679 --> 07:48.613
has revolutionized the field.

07:48.681 --> 07:50.774
Well, Dr. Bergstrom
is visiting from Sweden

07:50.883 --> 07:52.874
to attend
an international symposium

07:52.985 --> 07:55.044
on the peaceful application
of the technology.

07:55.387 --> 07:57.878
A great number of
people, including his wife,

07:58.090 --> 08:00.058
are deeply concerned
for his well-being.

08:00.159 --> 08:03.356
There are governments who would use
his knowledge for other purposes.

08:03.429 --> 08:05.761
From what I've heard, his
well-being isn't a problem.

08:05.865 --> 08:06.957
Meaning?

08:06.999 --> 08:09.763
What is Swedish
for "life in the fast lane"?

08:09.835 --> 08:11.268
Enough.
We've been asked to help.

08:11.337 --> 08:12.827
Wait a minute.

08:13.205 --> 08:16.606
Einstein or not, I'm not interested
in playing baby-sitter to...

08:16.675 --> 08:18.939
It's not a question
of baby-sitting.

08:19.011 --> 08:21.980
We've been asked to help
Dr. Bergstrom's stay

08:22.047 --> 08:25.107
to be pleasant
and as uneventful as possible.

08:25.918 --> 08:27.442
His niece, by the way,
is with him.

08:27.620 --> 08:29.144
You could show them
the sights.

08:29.255 --> 08:31.348
The sights? I'm... I'm
a terrible tour guide.

08:31.457 --> 08:32.424
I... I always get lost.

08:32.525 --> 08:33.822
Only when you want to.

08:34.559 --> 08:36.528
The Foundation
is hosting a reception

08:36.595 --> 08:39.996
for Dr. Bergstrom
at 3:00 sharp.

08:40.265 --> 08:44.134
And please, see that
you are dressed appropriately.

08:45.104 --> 08:47.072
A scientist and his niece
from Sweden.

08:47.139 --> 08:49.972
What am I going to say to a
scientist and his niece from Sweden?

08:50.042 --> 08:52.272
I don't... I don't know
even know a word of Swedish.

08:52.811 --> 08:54.005
Neither do I.

08:54.079 --> 08:56.980
My father's Swedish,
my mother's American.

08:57.249 --> 08:59.410
And I was born here
in the States.

08:59.518 --> 09:00.985
Actually, I lied.

09:01.053 --> 09:04.045
I can say ja,
but that's about it.

09:04.590 --> 09:05.488
Thank you.

09:05.591 --> 09:06.558
Thank you.

09:06.659 --> 09:08.854
Ah, luckily, there's not
a lot of call for Swedish

09:08.928 --> 09:11.089
in behavioral psych
these days.

09:11.497 --> 09:14.091
You can't be a psychologist.
You don't have a beard.

09:14.166 --> 09:15.997
Oh, that's because
I just graduated.

09:16.068 --> 09:17.228
The beard grows in later.

09:17.303 --> 09:18.292
Oh!

09:18.637 --> 09:21.401
You know, with your uncle
going to all these meetings,

09:21.473 --> 09:24.203
seems like you're gonna have
lots of free time on your hands.

09:24.276 --> 09:26.540
Oh, for the first time
in my life.

09:26.812 --> 09:29.303
You know, I just graduated
two weeks ago

09:29.381 --> 09:31.542
and, uh, suddenly,
I'm a free woman.

09:33.519 --> 09:36.784
Any idea what I can do
with all this independence?

09:36.855 --> 09:37.879
Well...

09:37.990 --> 09:40.891
Ah, careful, Christina.
He's a terrible tour guide.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.518
He always gets lost.

09:42.595 --> 09:43.619
No, that's not true.

09:43.696 --> 09:45.527
I know the city
like the back of my hand.

09:45.598 --> 09:49.056
That's a remarkable improvement,
Michael, in less than an hour.

09:49.268 --> 09:50.792
I see you've met Christina.

09:50.869 --> 09:53.064
This is her uncle,
Dr. Klaus Bergstrom.

09:53.138 --> 09:54.127
Michael Knight.

09:54.206 --> 09:55.730
I'm so pleased
to meet you, Michael.

09:55.808 --> 09:57.036
It's nice
to meet you, Doctor.

09:57.109 --> 09:58.406
Excuse me, Mr. Miles.

09:59.878 --> 10:01.937
Excuse me,
I'll be back in a moment.

10:02.014 --> 10:03.572
A moment is all I need.

10:03.682 --> 10:05.809
Once this affair breaks up,
where does, um,

10:05.918 --> 10:08.716
a bashful Swede go
to see the sights?

10:09.088 --> 10:11.886
Well, that depends on what kind
of sights you're looking for.

10:11.957 --> 10:14.755
That is simple.
The kind that a travel agent

10:14.827 --> 10:16.454
would not think
of recommending.

10:17.630 --> 10:19.325
Uncle Klaus, you promised.

10:19.498 --> 10:20.965
Research, Christina.

10:21.033 --> 10:23.194
After all, America
is a fascinating country.

10:23.269 --> 10:26.204
I must study it
in detail, yes?

10:26.772 --> 10:28.637
Yes, I understand.

10:28.907 --> 10:31.375
Keep me informed
on any further developments.

10:32.011 --> 10:33.000
Thank you.

10:41.587 --> 10:44.317
I must speak with you
immediately. Alone.

10:44.757 --> 10:46.281
Do excuse us, please.

10:48.661 --> 10:50.629
Garthe Knight
has escaped from prison.

10:51.230 --> 10:52.254
Escaped?

10:52.331 --> 10:53.263
Yes.

10:53.332 --> 10:54.321
How?

10:54.967 --> 10:56.992
So far,
the only detail we have

10:57.069 --> 11:00.505
is that a massive truck broke
through the prison walls.

11:02.308 --> 11:03.468
It's Goliath.

11:04.276 --> 11:06.471
I'm afraid so.
But how?

13:18.877 --> 13:20.538
Such passion.

13:20.612 --> 13:22.307
Is it me you love,
or freedom?

13:23.449 --> 13:26.111
Only a fool
would answer that question.

13:34.326 --> 13:36.726
You have exquisite tastes,
Adrianne.

13:37.596 --> 13:39.791
How much is this costing me?

13:39.998 --> 13:41.625
I broke you out of prison.

13:41.700 --> 13:44.100
Don't talk to me
about dollars and cents.

13:44.169 --> 13:47.195
Goliath broke me
out of prison.

13:47.639 --> 13:49.800
And I rebuilt Goliath.

13:49.875 --> 13:52.309
Resurrected him from a
burnt-out shell in the desert.

13:52.377 --> 13:54.902
Just as I directed this
project from the beginning.

13:54.980 --> 13:56.777
Never forget that.

14:01.453 --> 14:05.219
The dungeon.
Is it as I requested?

14:05.324 --> 14:06.518
Exactly.

14:06.592 --> 14:07.957
Good.

14:08.627 --> 14:10.356
What about the other?

14:11.263 --> 14:12.696
Look for yourself.

14:26.311 --> 14:30.441
Dr. Moritz completed the tertiary
state of reconstruction yesterday.

14:30.516 --> 14:33.007
You'll be very pleased.

14:33.085 --> 14:35.781
Everything is going exactly
as I promised it would.

14:36.221 --> 14:38.712
Even Goliath's weaknesses
have been eliminated.

14:39.458 --> 14:41.858
He's completely
invulnerable now.

14:42.094 --> 14:43.083
Fantastic.

14:44.663 --> 14:46.631
And the biodata implant?

14:46.698 --> 14:49.223
In place and
functioning beautifully.

14:49.935 --> 14:52.836
Much like the IV apparatus
introduces medicine

14:52.905 --> 14:55.066
drop by drop
into the bloodstream,

14:55.140 --> 14:58.109
the biodata unit is slowly
programming the patient's brain

14:58.176 --> 15:02.010
with every detail of the
subject's life and personality.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.810
Second by second,
24 hours a day.

15:05.884 --> 15:08.045
The only information
it doesn't have, though,

15:08.153 --> 15:10.951
is what's happened
in the last 24 hours.

15:11.156 --> 15:12.680
When do the bandages
come off?

15:12.958 --> 15:14.550
Tomorrow.

15:14.726 --> 15:17.524
You see, Garthe,
everything is under control.

15:17.596 --> 15:18.858
And on schedule.

15:18.931 --> 15:21.263
No, not quite everything.

15:21.333 --> 15:24.825
There's still one crucial
matter I have to attend to.

15:26.004 --> 15:28.939
Later. You can
take care of that later.

15:31.310 --> 15:34.541
Actually, I first went
online in a mainframe in Washington,

15:34.880 --> 15:37.678
but the government bureaucracy
never suited me. Too stuffy.

15:38.383 --> 15:40.351
I know exactly
what you mean!

15:40.452 --> 15:43.888
I have spent half my life
with dried-out bureaucrats

15:43.956 --> 15:46.891
who have dust in their veins
instead of blood.

15:46.959 --> 15:48.756
I'm much happier
at the Foundation.

15:48.827 --> 15:51.762
Of course, I still have
to deal with human beings.

15:51.830 --> 15:55.163
Well, you're not exactly a cold
beer on a hot day either, pal.

15:55.334 --> 15:57.825
Moody, temperamental,
and almost no sense of humor.

15:57.903 --> 15:58.995
I beg your pardon,

15:59.071 --> 16:01.232
I have a highly developed
sense of humor.

16:01.306 --> 16:02.273
For example

16:02.341 --> 16:03.865
have you heard
the one about the man

16:03.942 --> 16:05.569
who walked into
the bar with a horse?

16:05.677 --> 16:07.144
Ah, later.

16:07.579 --> 16:10.309
We're here.
And not a moment too soon.

16:22.427 --> 16:23.826
Christina.

16:27.165 --> 16:28.393
Good night, KITT.

16:28.467 --> 16:31.027
Perhaps a fast game
of chess before I leave?

16:31.103 --> 16:32.695
I'd be delighted.

16:32.771 --> 16:34.932
There are still
642 variations

16:35.007 --> 16:37.237
of the Stravinchy defense
I'd like to try.

16:37.309 --> 16:39.140
And afterwards,
we could discuss your work

16:39.211 --> 16:40.508
in laser technology.

16:41.480 --> 16:42.879
I would be delighted.

16:46.051 --> 16:47.177
Are you all right?

16:47.285 --> 16:49.753
Yes. Yes, I think so.

16:49.855 --> 16:51.755
I think we'd better
put some ice on it.

16:51.823 --> 16:55.987
Ice? I was just going to ask,
uh, Michael to join us for dinner.

16:56.061 --> 16:58.393
Uncle Klaus,
Michael probably has plans.

16:58.463 --> 16:59.828
No, I don't.
Nothing special.

16:59.898 --> 17:01.195
Consider me yours.

17:01.299 --> 17:04.632
That is the spirit.
I love America already.

17:04.703 --> 17:08.867
Now, where is a really good
restaurant and nightclub?

17:08.906 --> 17:11.933
How does
Chez Room Service sound?

17:12.077 --> 17:14.045
Room service?
Christina...

17:14.112 --> 17:16.603
Uncle Klaus,
I'm going to take care of you

17:16.714 --> 17:19.080
and your ankle,
whether you like it or not.

17:20.318 --> 17:21.285
All right.

17:55.353 --> 17:58.811
Foundation for Law and
Government, may I help you?

18:27.285 --> 18:28.252
What was that?

18:57.215 --> 18:58.739
We meet again.

19:12.931 --> 19:14.330
So, this is
what it's like.

19:15.167 --> 19:16.361
What?

19:16.434 --> 19:18.493
The big city.
The real world.

19:18.570 --> 19:20.868
You know, I've been so busy
going to school,

19:20.939 --> 19:23.373
I really haven't had a
chance to see much of it.

19:24.409 --> 19:26.206
Well, you've got lots
to look forward to

19:26.344 --> 19:27.811
and a lot of time to look.

19:27.879 --> 19:30.279
That's one of the reasons
why I came with Uncle Klaus.

19:30.382 --> 19:32.680
You know, I'm thinking
of moving out here this fall.

19:32.784 --> 19:35.184
Away from home
and the family,

19:35.253 --> 19:38.689
and everything that's been so
secure and dependable for so long.

19:38.757 --> 19:41.590
I think what you need
is an experienced tour guide.

19:42.127 --> 19:44.095
Sounds wonderful.
Got anybody in mind?

19:44.162 --> 19:45.151
Me.

19:45.230 --> 19:47.790
That sounds wonderful, too.
When?

19:47.866 --> 19:48.855
How about tomorrow?

19:48.934 --> 19:50.765
Perfect. What time?

19:51.136 --> 19:53.570
I'll check Devon's schedule
and I'll give you a call.

19:53.638 --> 19:54.627
Okay.

19:54.840 --> 19:56.137
Bye.
Bye.

20:24.069 --> 20:25.969
I want Michael Knight!

20:26.905 --> 20:28.702
If you think
I'll give you any information

20:28.773 --> 20:30.536
about Michael,
you're mistaken.

20:30.609 --> 20:32.509
This madness
will never succeed.

20:32.577 --> 20:34.568
As always,
you underestimate me.

20:34.646 --> 20:36.773
Our last encounter
wasn't a defeat,

20:36.848 --> 20:38.873
it was merely
a temporary setback.

20:39.217 --> 20:42.345
I will succeed this time.
It is my destiny.

20:42.454 --> 20:44.251
Your destiny
is self-destruction.

20:44.322 --> 20:45.721
Destruction, yes.

20:46.825 --> 20:49.589
But Michael Knight's,
not mine.

20:50.128 --> 20:51.390
And you

20:51.463 --> 20:54.796
and you
will be the instruments.

20:55.934 --> 20:59.734
Get up.
You're coming with me.

20:59.804 --> 21:00.998
Both of you.

21:01.072 --> 21:02.972
Why? What possible purpose
could it...

21:04.009 --> 21:05.408
Move!

21:17.355 --> 21:18.379
You seem pleased.

21:18.490 --> 21:19.479
I am.

21:19.591 --> 21:21.218
Was it the food
or the company?

21:21.293 --> 21:22.317
Both.

21:22.394 --> 21:24.555
Hey, what's with
the third degree, anyway?

21:24.629 --> 21:25.789
Just checking.

21:25.864 --> 21:27.923
My sensors indicate
some interesting

21:27.999 --> 21:29.990
biochemical activity
in your body.

21:30.235 --> 21:32.635
Not related to digestion,
I might add.

21:32.704 --> 21:33.728
Meaning?

21:33.805 --> 21:34.829
You tell me.

21:34.906 --> 21:38.398
Either you had a scintillating
conversation with Dr. Klaus Bergstrom,

21:38.576 --> 21:41.204
or you and Christina
found something to chat about.

21:41.279 --> 21:43.213
Well, take a wild guess,
buddy.

21:43.315 --> 21:45.340
Advanced human psychology?

21:48.186 --> 21:49.847
That's strange.

21:50.021 --> 21:51.750
The Foundation's gates
are open.

21:51.823 --> 21:54.223
Yes. And I get no response
from security.

21:54.292 --> 21:55.384
Something's wrong, Michael.

21:55.460 --> 21:57.360
Just what I was thinking, pal.

22:16.481 --> 22:17.675
Oh, no.

22:18.950 --> 22:19.917
April!

22:22.420 --> 22:24.547
Kathy, you all right?

22:25.757 --> 22:26.724
What happened?

22:27.826 --> 22:29.088
What happened?

22:29.160 --> 22:31.424
They forced their way in.

22:32.030 --> 22:35.090
Michael,
he took Devon and April.

22:35.667 --> 22:38.101
He?
Who are you talking about?

22:39.237 --> 22:40.226
Garthe.

22:55.520 --> 22:56.953
Hello.

22:58.723 --> 23:00.452
Adrianne Margeaux.

23:00.525 --> 23:02.516
I'm so pleased you remember,

23:03.294 --> 23:05.762
but so disappointed that
Michael Knight isn't with you.

23:05.864 --> 23:07.764
I thought you
were in prison.

23:07.832 --> 23:09.857
Prison? Perish the thought.

23:10.935 --> 23:13.267
I have the best lawyers
that money can buy.

23:13.338 --> 23:16.273
And they bought the best judge
that money can buy.

23:17.509 --> 23:20.478
Isn't it fascinating the
friends that we have in common?

23:21.513 --> 23:22.946
Such a small world.

23:23.014 --> 23:24.743
Garthe Knight is no friend.

23:25.183 --> 23:26.912
Even you should know that.

23:27.986 --> 23:29.453
Poor Garthe.

23:29.521 --> 23:31.989
People say such
nasty things about him.

23:32.624 --> 23:35.422
But such good things
about Michael Knight.

23:35.827 --> 23:39.319
I'm beginning to wonder if
he's really flesh and blood.

23:40.131 --> 23:42.531
I look forward to
finding out for myself.

23:45.203 --> 23:47.535
Allow me to show you
to your room.

23:47.705 --> 23:50.139
I do hope
the bath towels match.

24:11.896 --> 24:13.488
Lovely, isn't it?

24:15.533 --> 24:17.296
Don't worry,

24:17.368 --> 24:20.030
this room's reserved for
a very, very special guest.

24:47.265 --> 24:49.756
With luck,
he'll be here soon.

24:49.834 --> 24:52.769
For your sake,
I hope he is.

25:20.131 --> 25:22.122
I've been all through
the Foundation.

25:22.734 --> 25:24.361
He didn't leave a clue.
Nothing.

25:24.469 --> 25:26.403
Perhaps the police
will find something.

25:26.471 --> 25:28.405
Yeah, well, perhaps
isn't good enough.

25:29.774 --> 25:32.470
If not inside,
then maybe outside.

25:32.544 --> 25:34.671
Look, scan the entire area.
Look for anything,

25:34.746 --> 25:36.907
no matter how small,
no matter how insignificant.

25:36.981 --> 25:38.744
Right away, Michael.

25:42.420 --> 25:43.819
I'm afraid there's nothing.

25:44.956 --> 25:46.753
Wait a minute.
What's that?

25:46.991 --> 25:47.958
What?

25:48.026 --> 25:50.256
There appears to be drops
of radiator coolant

25:50.328 --> 25:51.420
on the driveway.

25:51.496 --> 25:52.485
Enough to follow?

25:52.564 --> 25:53.553
I'm not sure.

25:53.631 --> 25:55.565
It depends upon
how consistent the drops are,

25:55.633 --> 25:57.863
the amount of liquid,
the weather conditions...

25:57.936 --> 26:00.962
Devon and April's lives
may hang in the balance, KITT.

26:35.707 --> 26:37.732
How're we doing, buddy?
Still on the trail?

26:37.809 --> 26:39.800
The drops are
remarkably consistent.

26:39.877 --> 26:42.846
Good. We can use
every break we can get.

26:42.914 --> 26:45.314
You know, it's hard to believe
Garthe succeeded

26:45.416 --> 26:46.713
in breaking out of prison.

26:46.818 --> 26:48.513
Not with Goliath, it isn't.

26:48.620 --> 26:50.247
Did you say Goliath?

26:51.289 --> 26:54.452
Yeah,
I thought I'd mentioned that.

26:54.525 --> 26:56.459
You certainly did not.

26:56.594 --> 26:59.256
Michael, I thought
we destroyed that monster.

26:59.330 --> 27:01.195
I thought we did, too.

27:01.266 --> 27:03.962
Somehow, some way,

27:04.068 --> 27:06.764
somebody put the pieces
back together again.

27:06.871 --> 27:09.101
Who could have done
such a terrible thing?

27:09.140 --> 27:11.904
It's a good question.
Who and why?

27:12.610 --> 27:14.271
Garthe hates me,

27:14.345 --> 27:17.837
but he's also very greedy
for money and power.

27:18.249 --> 27:21.776
Whatever he's up to, it's much
more than a personal vendetta.

27:22.587 --> 27:24.555
The question is

27:24.756 --> 27:26.690
what's he after this time?

27:26.758 --> 27:28.248
I want it all.

27:30.528 --> 27:32.018
A new life.

27:33.698 --> 27:35.029
A new future.

27:35.300 --> 27:37.165
Most of all, revenge.

27:38.236 --> 27:39.533
You have your life.

27:39.604 --> 27:42.072
And before long, your future
is gonna be assured.

27:42.140 --> 27:43.607
Forget this childish revenge.

27:43.675 --> 27:44.801
Never.

27:44.876 --> 27:47.538
Nothing means anything
without it.

27:47.612 --> 27:48.840
Then you're a fool.

27:48.980 --> 27:50.811
You're not going to
jeopardize this project

27:50.915 --> 27:52.576
because of it.
I won't allow it.

27:52.684 --> 27:53.776
How intriguing.

27:54.752 --> 27:56.481
I hadn't really
appreciated the extent

27:56.587 --> 27:58.145
of your interest
in Michael Knight.

27:58.256 --> 28:00.554
My interest in Michael Knight
is none of your business.

28:00.625 --> 28:02.183
Oh, but it is.

28:02.260 --> 28:05.718
You see, you want him alive,
and I want him dead.

28:05.997 --> 28:08.522
Now, one of us is going
to be terribly disappointed.

28:14.005 --> 28:15.131
Excuse me.

28:17.442 --> 28:20.707
Yes? Good.
Send him in.

28:22.814 --> 28:23.803
He's ready.

28:37.995 --> 28:39.462
Good afternoon.

28:40.064 --> 28:41.531
Good afternoon.

28:47.305 --> 28:48.567
Good afternoon.

29:06.357 --> 29:07.722
Someone's coming.

29:12.130 --> 29:13.290
Good morning.

29:13.364 --> 29:15.525
Breakfast will
be along shortly.

29:15.833 --> 29:17.698
Doing your morning
calisthenics, I see?

29:17.769 --> 29:19.293
I beg your pardon?

29:19.370 --> 29:21.304
Someone's been standing
on the bed.

29:22.573 --> 29:25.041
I'd hate to think that
you were trying to escape.

29:25.109 --> 29:28.010
He doesn't have the will
or the imagination.

29:30.715 --> 29:34.446
You, on the other hand,
have something very special.

29:34.552 --> 29:37.988
Beauty, elegance, and grace.

29:39.023 --> 29:40.991
Leave her alone.

29:41.192 --> 29:43.752
You remind me
of a filly I once owned.

29:43.895 --> 29:46.796
Beautiful, spirited,
free, and wild.

29:46.864 --> 29:49.094
It took me two weeks
to break her.

29:49.167 --> 29:50.998
And I enjoyed
every minute of it.

29:51.803 --> 29:52.997
You disgust me.

29:53.070 --> 29:56.198
Now, now, Garthe.
Your fangs are showing.

29:56.641 --> 29:57.767
I hate to
dash your hopes,

29:57.842 --> 29:59.833
but this is not
a purely social visit.

29:59.911 --> 30:02.778
There's someone that
I'd like you to see. Doctor.

30:06.784 --> 30:10.151
Klaus! Are you all right?
Did they hurt you?

30:10.521 --> 30:12.386
I am fine.

30:12.824 --> 30:15.122
Bravo!
Congratulations!

30:15.193 --> 30:16.217
Thank you.

30:17.261 --> 30:18.558
Good day.

30:20.064 --> 30:21.964
What have you done to him?

30:22.567 --> 30:25.730
Oh, nothing that a little
corrective surgery won't remedy.

30:26.037 --> 30:28.164
You see,
this was not Klaus Bergstrom.

30:28.673 --> 30:30.834
A rather good imitation,
don't you think?

31:16.721 --> 31:19.189
Michael
Knight, please. I see.

31:19.524 --> 31:21.890
No, it's not important.

31:22.026 --> 31:24.256
Can you please tell him
Christina called?

31:24.328 --> 31:25.352
Thank you.

31:26.731 --> 31:29.461
That's strange.
He said he'd call.

31:30.768 --> 31:32.133
Where do you suppose
he could be?

31:32.203 --> 31:33.192
Hmm?

31:33.838 --> 31:35.032
Uncle Klaus?

31:35.373 --> 31:36.362
Yes.

31:37.275 --> 31:40.711
Look at you. A man of your
intelligence, your vision,

31:40.845 --> 31:44.246
you come to America to enlighten
the world on laser technology,

31:44.315 --> 31:47.409
and before I know it, you're
like every other American male.

31:47.585 --> 31:50.145
Glued to the television set
watching football.

31:52.490 --> 31:54.185
What an incredible game.

31:54.325 --> 31:56.020
These Americans are crazy!

31:56.093 --> 31:58.721
Have you ever watched them
play football?

31:58.796 --> 32:00.821
It's got you hooked,
Uncle Klaus.

32:00.965 --> 32:01.954
Not really.

32:02.066 --> 32:03.055
Hmm.

32:04.835 --> 32:07.531
Christina, what is wrong?

32:08.172 --> 32:09.161
Nothing.

32:09.607 --> 32:12.371
There's no football now.
So what is wrong?

32:13.044 --> 32:14.875
Michael said
he'd call this morning

32:14.946 --> 32:17.210
and, uh, I can't reach him
at the Foundation.

32:18.716 --> 32:19.808
He likes you.

32:19.917 --> 32:21.612
I'm not...

32:21.719 --> 32:24.085
That's not
what I'm concerned about.

32:24.188 --> 32:25.815
It sounds to me

32:25.890 --> 32:28.484
like something
has got you hooked, too.

32:28.559 --> 32:29.526
Ah-ha-ha.

32:29.660 --> 32:33.323
You were going shopping.
So go.

32:33.397 --> 32:36.161
If he calls, I will tell him
that you're out

32:36.434 --> 32:39.426
with a very handsome young man
who adores you.

32:39.570 --> 32:41.663
Oh, don't you dare.

32:55.152 --> 32:57.620
... ball, second and 13.

32:58.389 --> 32:59.879
And here comes the snap.

32:59.991 --> 33:02.186
Here goes Thorpe through
the left side of the line.

33:02.259 --> 33:04.955
He's down to the 19, down to
the 20, down to the 24-yard line.

33:06.797 --> 33:10.597
Christina, how is he
supposed to miss you

33:10.668 --> 33:12.397
if you never go away?

33:17.908 --> 33:20.103
Hello, Dr. Bergstrom.

33:32.189 --> 33:35.124
The spots seem to be
increasing in size, Michael.

33:35.359 --> 33:37.156
They turned off that road.

33:37.728 --> 33:39.559
We may be
getting somewhere, pal.

33:39.930 --> 33:41.830
You don't suppose
this could be a trap,

33:41.899 --> 33:42.923
do you, Michael?

33:43.000 --> 33:45.560
KITT, with
Garthe, anything's possible.

33:45.636 --> 33:47.570
Is that also true of Goliath?

33:47.972 --> 33:48.961
What do you mean?

33:49.040 --> 33:52.032
Is it possible he's a new
and improved model?

33:54.679 --> 33:55.668
You're hesitating.

33:56.647 --> 33:58.444
Well, to hesitate is human.

33:58.616 --> 34:00.413
I thought, "To err is human. "

34:00.518 --> 34:01.485
Both are.

34:01.619 --> 34:03.086
And now you're stalling.

34:03.921 --> 34:05.445
All right, KITT,
it's possible.

34:05.556 --> 34:07.217
Yeah, it's very possible.

34:08.659 --> 34:09.648
You all right?

34:09.793 --> 34:13.161
That depends upon
how one defines "all right. "

34:13.496 --> 34:14.964
Now you're stalling.

34:16.100 --> 34:19.263
Okay, no. I'm not all right.

34:19.503 --> 34:21.027
The thought
of meeting Goliath again

34:21.105 --> 34:22.663
is quite unsettling.

34:22.940 --> 34:25.306
Join the club, pal.
Join the club.

34:25.643 --> 34:27.440
Thank you, I'd rather not.

34:38.422 --> 34:39.684
I'd like
to leave my room key.

34:39.757 --> 34:40.724
Of course.

34:40.824 --> 34:43.521
Excuse me, please. Aren't
you Dr. Bergstrom's niece?

34:43.594 --> 34:44.618
Yes.

34:44.695 --> 34:45.992
Oh. He is so handsome.

34:46.063 --> 34:47.360
He just walked
through the lobby

34:47.431 --> 34:49.922
and none of the girls behind
the desk could stop staring.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.024
You just saw my uncle?

34:51.101 --> 34:52.159
Yeah. A few minutes ago.

34:52.235 --> 34:53.225
On his way out?

34:53.304 --> 34:55.568
No. I think he was returning
to his room.

35:30.274 --> 35:31.605
Uncle Klaus.

35:31.742 --> 35:33.107
What is it, Christina?

35:33.177 --> 35:34.838
Were you just downstairs?

35:34.912 --> 35:38.541
If I was, then I'm more
of a genius than they say.

35:38.883 --> 35:41.113
Being in two places
at the same time

35:41.218 --> 35:43.015
is quite a...
quite a feat.

35:43.554 --> 35:45.454
And, uh, depending
on the circumstances,

35:45.523 --> 35:47.354
it could be quite a treat.

35:47.725 --> 35:49.693
Well, I just had
the strangest experience.

35:49.794 --> 35:51.421
There was a man getting
on the elevator

35:51.495 --> 35:53.395
that looked so much
like Michael.

35:53.631 --> 35:55.724
Ah. Except for a mustache.

35:56.333 --> 35:59.393
I thought you were supposed
to be looking after me.

36:01.505 --> 36:02.494
Well...

36:03.374 --> 36:04.363
Hmm?

36:05.509 --> 36:07.739
You are terrible.

36:08.245 --> 36:10.270
All right, I'll ask.
Did he?

36:13.384 --> 36:16.353
My mind is on
a thousand things, Christina.

36:16.453 --> 36:18.921
Uh, I don't know what
you're talking about here.

36:20.191 --> 36:21.283
Football?

36:21.358 --> 36:24.156
I'm talking about Michael
and you know it.

36:24.528 --> 36:25.517
Ah.

36:26.197 --> 36:28.825
Michael! Well, why didn't
you say so?

36:28.899 --> 36:30.059
Well, did he call?

36:30.634 --> 36:31.623
No.

36:32.269 --> 36:33.600
Oh.

36:53.824 --> 36:55.621
You're awfully quiet.

36:55.793 --> 36:57.556
Still thinking about Goliath?

36:57.628 --> 36:59.152
I'm used to worrying about you.

36:59.230 --> 37:00.424
I expect to worry about you.

37:00.497 --> 37:03.432
But Devon and April...
I feel so helpless.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.627
Well, consider it
a temporary situation

37:05.736 --> 37:07.431
'cause we're gonna find them.

37:09.073 --> 37:10.631
Michael, look!

37:11.475 --> 37:13.102
Give me a reading real quick.

37:16.680 --> 37:19.080
Is that Devon and April?

37:20.150 --> 37:21.583
Those figures aren't human.

37:21.652 --> 37:23.586
They're wearing Devon's
and April's clothing,

37:23.654 --> 37:25.645
but their bodies
are made of polyurethane.

37:25.756 --> 37:26.984
Mannequins.

37:27.391 --> 37:30.224
Looks like we've
been led on a wild-goose chase.

37:31.228 --> 37:35.062
I'm afraid
it's more than that, Michael.

37:36.800 --> 37:37.789
I'm sinking.

37:38.135 --> 37:40.433
Get out of here. Fast!

37:40.504 --> 37:41.937
Michael,
traction is impossible.

37:42.072 --> 37:43.539
I'm sinking deeper.

37:43.607 --> 37:45.837
All right,
let's try your grappling hook.

37:54.618 --> 37:56.916
Michael, is this it?
The big adios?

37:56.987 --> 37:58.852
All right, hang on, buddy.
Here we go.

37:59.657 --> 38:01.522
Okay, try it!

38:03.394 --> 38:05.453
Easy. Easy.

38:05.963 --> 38:06.952
Come on.

38:10.434 --> 38:11.423
Come on.

38:12.336 --> 38:14.099
Come on, baby.

38:14.772 --> 38:15.761
Come on.

38:19.877 --> 38:21.708
Come on.

38:26.016 --> 38:26.983
All right.

38:29.687 --> 38:33.020
I wonder whether Garthe
expected us to go under

38:33.090 --> 38:35.251
or if this was
just designed to buy time.

38:35.326 --> 38:36.657
Time for what?

38:36.727 --> 38:38.217
I don't know, KITT.

38:38.295 --> 38:39.990
I'll feel a lot
better when I do.

39:20.871 --> 39:22.133
I'll get it.

39:25.909 --> 39:26.898
Hello.

39:28.112 --> 39:29.101
Yes.

39:29.513 --> 39:30.502
Is it Michael?

39:31.448 --> 39:34.178
Uh-huh. I'll tell him.
Thank you.

39:35.519 --> 39:37.043
That was Mr. Andrews.

39:37.154 --> 39:41.090
And he wanted me to tell you that the
press conference has been finalized.

39:43.594 --> 39:45.994
I hate press conferences.

39:47.064 --> 39:48.622
The thing I'm going
to miss the most

39:48.699 --> 39:50.929
when I get back
to Sweden is football.

39:51.735 --> 39:53.669
Especially
the beer commercials.

39:53.904 --> 39:55.895
I don't know
which is more violent,

39:56.040 --> 39:57.974
the game or the commercials.

39:59.143 --> 40:00.610
Where're you going?

40:01.345 --> 40:03.870
To get a beer, of course.
It's un-American

40:03.947 --> 40:05.710
to watch football
and not drink beer.

40:05.816 --> 40:07.044
Y-Your ankle!

40:07.151 --> 40:08.175
What?

40:08.285 --> 40:10.116
Well, your ankle,
you twisted it yesterday,

40:10.187 --> 40:11.484
don't you remember?

40:12.389 --> 40:16.519
Of course I remember.
But it is much better.

40:45.155 --> 40:46.122
Devon.

40:47.658 --> 40:50.354
As if this wasn't
already difficult enough.

40:56.266 --> 40:57.255
A visitor.

41:10.447 --> 41:11.846
What have you
done to him?

41:11.949 --> 41:13.541
Oh, nothing
time won't cure.

41:13.951 --> 41:15.213
His pulse is strong.

41:15.319 --> 41:18.379
Oh, he's too valuable
to injure. Unlike you.

41:18.922 --> 41:20.583
Too valuable?

41:21.158 --> 41:23.058
What do you intend
to do with him?

41:23.127 --> 41:25.527
Sell him on the open market
to the highest bidder?

41:25.596 --> 41:26.722
Close.

41:26.830 --> 41:28.354
Except the bidding is over.

41:28.432 --> 41:31.128
Now it's only a matter of
delivering the goods on time.

41:32.069 --> 41:35.038
How's the great escape
coming, huh?

41:36.373 --> 41:37.635
Tedious work.

41:39.476 --> 41:42.240
Believe me, I know.

41:54.324 --> 41:56.189
He's coming to.

41:56.260 --> 41:57.522
What's that smell?

41:57.661 --> 41:58.958
It's chloroform.

42:04.368 --> 42:07.428
You think it's possible
to duplicate a man so closely

42:07.571 --> 42:09.971
that he won't
be exposed as a fraud?

42:11.275 --> 42:14.676
At home, among family
and friends, I'd say no.

42:15.012 --> 42:17.674
But here it's possible.

42:17.981 --> 42:20.506
Even Christina
doesn't know him that well.

42:25.556 --> 42:28.024
The trap didn't work.
Michael Knight escaped.

42:28.425 --> 42:30.916
It's all right.
A temporary setback.

42:30.994 --> 42:33.394
I prefer to take him
with Goliath, anyway.

42:33.597 --> 42:34.791
What about the sub?

42:34.865 --> 42:35.854
I've made contact.

42:35.933 --> 42:38.231
Pickup is still tomorrow
at 1500 hours.

42:38.302 --> 42:39.291
Terrific.

42:39.403 --> 42:41.963
So, the elusive Michael Knight
is at large.

42:42.372 --> 42:43.634
Too bad.

42:44.341 --> 42:47.037
In the meantime,
have any ideas

42:47.110 --> 42:49.271
about how to pass
a quiet afternoon?

42:51.982 --> 42:54.678
Michael, Kathy is
calling from the Foundation.

42:56.320 --> 42:57.309
Hello, Kathy.

42:57.421 --> 42:59.048
Hello, Michael. Any luck?

42:59.489 --> 43:00.956
Well, I thought I had a lead,

43:01.058 --> 43:02.787
but it turned out
to be a dead end.

43:02.859 --> 43:04.224
Anything from the police?

43:04.294 --> 43:06.854
Nothing so far.
Christina's been calling.

43:06.964 --> 43:09.330
Yeah, we'd made plans.
I'll call her when I get back.

43:09.366 --> 43:11.800
The last time she
called she sounded frightened.

43:11.868 --> 43:13.631
She said it was urgent.

43:13.704 --> 43:15.103
All right,
I better check it out.

43:16.240 --> 43:17.229
Bye.

43:19.543 --> 43:20.908
Hope Christina's all right.

43:21.044 --> 43:22.409
Why wouldn't she be?

43:22.479 --> 43:23.776
I don't know.

43:24.748 --> 43:26.113
Just a bad feeling.

44:09.660 --> 44:12.857
I'm sorry.
I'm just so confused.

44:12.963 --> 44:14.294
It's all right.
What's wrong?

44:14.398 --> 44:16.093
Uncle Klaus.

44:16.233 --> 44:17.928
I know this
is gonna sound crazy.

44:18.702 --> 44:20.829
But it's like
he's not the same person.

44:20.904 --> 44:22.303
He's not the same person.

44:22.372 --> 44:23.839
What do you mean?
Something happen?

44:24.408 --> 44:27.275
Nothing big.
Just little things.

44:27.377 --> 44:29.174
Do you remember
when he twisted his ankle?

44:29.246 --> 44:32.613
Well, he's been walking around the
hotel room as if nothing's wrong.

44:32.716 --> 44:34.445
And then when
I asked him about it,

44:34.551 --> 44:38.180
he just looked at me as if he
didn't know what I was talking about.

44:38.322 --> 44:41.018
Michael,
do you think I'm crazy?

44:41.792 --> 44:43.987
Yesterday I would've said yes.

44:44.127 --> 44:46.322
Today I'm not so sure.
Come on.

44:55.038 --> 44:57.063
Ah! You found him.

44:57.140 --> 44:58.334
Yes, finally.

44:58.408 --> 44:59.807
Hello, Doctor.

44:59.876 --> 45:00.968
Michael.

45:01.478 --> 45:02.570
Going dancing?

45:02.713 --> 45:04.806
Oh, no,
press conference tomorrow.

45:04.915 --> 45:07.042
The last one
I attended in Stockholm

45:07.150 --> 45:08.583
the reporters
paid more attention

45:08.652 --> 45:10.677
to the hole
in my shoe than my work.

45:11.054 --> 45:13.022
This time
I am ready for them.

45:13.423 --> 45:15.391
Will you care
to join us for dinner?

45:15.559 --> 45:19.586
I have been invited by the
International Laser Optics Society.

45:20.230 --> 45:23.097
It's very boring, but they say
the food is magnificent.

45:23.166 --> 45:25.726
I've got a few things to take
care of. But thanks, anyway.

45:25.802 --> 45:27.292
I just stopped by
to say hello.

45:27.371 --> 45:29.032
Thank you.

45:30.273 --> 45:32.503
Oh, yeah, those tickets I
mentioned, to Disneyland,

45:32.576 --> 45:35.101
I can't get them
until next week. I'm sorry.

45:35.479 --> 45:37.606
Oh, that is too bad.

45:37.681 --> 45:40.445
Well, perhaps next time.

45:40.617 --> 45:41.584
Hmm?

45:42.018 --> 45:43.485
Walk me down.

45:53.230 --> 45:54.959
I don't know
who that man is in there,

45:55.031 --> 45:56.692
but it's not Klaus Bergstrom.

45:56.767 --> 45:59.736
I never mentioned anything
about Disneyland to your uncle.

45:59.803 --> 46:02.169
Michael, where's my uncle?
What is...

46:02.239 --> 46:04.139
KITT, tap into
the hotel phone system.

46:04.207 --> 46:07.973
I want to see if a call
goes out from room 1525.

46:08.078 --> 46:09.443
Right away, Michael.

46:16.820 --> 46:17.912
Christina, listen to me.

46:18.021 --> 46:19.488
Devon and April
have disappeared.

46:19.956 --> 46:21.651
Now, I think
there's some connection.

46:21.792 --> 46:23.521
I hate to ask you
to do this.

46:23.593 --> 46:24.617
What?

46:24.694 --> 46:26.821
We can't afford to let
them know we're onto them.

46:28.165 --> 46:29.189
Yeah, KITT, what is it?

46:29.266 --> 46:30.790
A call is going out, Michael.

46:30.867 --> 46:32.926
Trace it.
I'll get right back to you.

46:33.036 --> 46:34.731
I can't ask you to
go back in there.

46:34.805 --> 46:35.965
I know
what you're gonna say.

46:36.039 --> 46:37.233
If they know
that we know...

46:37.307 --> 46:39.070
Not bad for
a small-town girl.

46:39.142 --> 46:41.303
Now, they think
they've got us fooled.

46:41.378 --> 46:43.175
I want to keep it that way.

46:43.647 --> 46:45.114
But it's up to you.

46:45.248 --> 46:48.308
I won't pretend I have
any idea what's going on.

46:48.518 --> 46:51.112
All I know is
Uncle Klaus is in danger.

46:51.354 --> 46:52.651
And I trust you.

46:52.856 --> 46:55.984
So, if you think
it's important, I'll do it.

46:56.126 --> 46:58.151
Don't worry
about the big city,

46:58.228 --> 47:00.696
you're gonna do just fine.
You be careful.

47:04.868 --> 47:06.995
I need an
address on that number, pal.

47:07.070 --> 47:09.163
It's a hi-com
unlisted number, Michael.

47:09.239 --> 47:12.106
I'll have to go to the heart of
the phone company's computers.

47:12.175 --> 47:13.437
Go for it.

47:24.421 --> 47:26.013
I have the address, Michael.

47:26.122 --> 47:28.852
Plot me the
fastest route, KITT.

48:09.199 --> 48:11.064
Get me Mr. Knight, quick.

48:16.006 --> 48:19.442
Michael, I'm picking
up something quite strange.

48:19.609 --> 48:21.440
All right, let's have a look.

48:27.918 --> 48:28.942
Bingo.

48:29.052 --> 48:31.646
Bingo indeed. It's Goliath.

48:32.022 --> 48:34.513
At least we know
we're on the right track.

48:34.624 --> 48:35.852
How far away is he?

48:35.926 --> 48:38.360
2.3 miles and closing fast.

48:38.428 --> 48:39.486
Speed?

48:39.563 --> 48:41.224
120 and accelerating.

48:41.364 --> 48:43.924
Michael, surely you're not
thinking of confrontation?

48:44.100 --> 48:45.863
I'd rather avoid one,

48:46.269 --> 48:49.432
but he's standing between us
and Devon and April.

48:49.506 --> 48:51.633
All right,
scan for the weak spots.

48:53.109 --> 48:55.009
Michael, they've been repaired.

48:55.579 --> 48:57.672
Goliath is invulnerable.

49:15.632 --> 49:17.497
Michael, what's our plan?

49:17.567 --> 49:19.432
We do have a plan, don't we?

49:19.569 --> 49:21.434
Give me a visual on the road.

49:22.172 --> 49:24.800
At present rate of
speed, we'll meet about here.

49:24.874 --> 49:27.206
What's that to the
left of the road up there?

49:27.277 --> 49:30.110
A cliff. Over
300 feet straight down.

49:31.781 --> 49:33.510
All right.

49:34.084 --> 49:36.678
Hang on, pal.
He's got the size,

49:36.786 --> 49:38.811
but we've got
the maneuverability.

49:38.922 --> 49:40.685
Right now I'd trade.

49:52.235 --> 49:54.032
Michael, we're out of control.

49:54.104 --> 49:55.196
Reverse turbo!

49:55.271 --> 49:57.034
Malfunction.

50:03.480 --> 50:05.209
Michael,
what are we going to do?

50:05.315 --> 50:07.545
Pray April fixed you.

50:17.093 --> 50:19.084
My circuits are shorting.

50:20.130 --> 50:21.757
Come on, baby!

50:26.336 --> 50:27.428
Whoa!

50:28.672 --> 50:32.164
It worked! KITT, it worked!

50:33.376 --> 50:34.570
Whoa!

50:34.778 --> 50:36.370
Thank goodness!

50:39.349 --> 50:40.577
Get him.

50:44.921 --> 50:45.945
Oh!

50:46.623 --> 50:47.920
Beautiful.

51:04.174 --> 51:06.540
I'd rather be
turned into a toaster oven

51:06.609 --> 51:08.440
than go through this again.

51:08.511 --> 51:10.479
I'm with you there, pal.

51:10.947 --> 51:13.211
At least we're
still in one piece.

51:13.316 --> 51:14.283
Whew!

51:14.384 --> 51:17.114
All right, let's
get rid of this trash.

51:50.353 --> 51:51.718
He's mine.

52:06.970 --> 52:09.165
KITT, can you hear me?

52:09.239 --> 52:10.570
Michael, is that you?

52:10.640 --> 52:11.664
Yeah.

52:12.942 --> 52:14.102
You okay?

52:14.177 --> 52:17.305
No, I'm not okay.
I'm nowhere near okay.

52:17.380 --> 52:19.280
Most of my functions
are out of order,

52:19.382 --> 52:21.316
and I'm being treated
like a side of beef.

52:21.551 --> 52:22.540
Where are you?

52:22.652 --> 52:25.052
In the garage, and
it's not a pleasant experience.

52:25.121 --> 52:27.783
I'm not exactly in
the Palace Hotel either.

52:27.857 --> 52:29.688
Don't worry,
we'll get out of this.

52:29.759 --> 52:31.124
I certainly hope so.

52:31.194 --> 52:33.185
Police impound
would be preferable

52:33.263 --> 52:35.231
to the company
I'm forced to keep now.

52:35.298 --> 52:36.788
Hold it. Hold it.

52:45.041 --> 52:48.340
Imagine this.
We meet again.

52:49.813 --> 52:50.973
Surprised?

52:51.047 --> 52:52.173
Not particularly.

52:52.248 --> 52:53.340
Liar!

52:54.684 --> 52:57.812
The last time we met, I
promised to take you to Africa.

52:57.921 --> 53:01.084
To the very prison in
which I was forced to exist.

53:01.524 --> 53:04.584
Unfortunately,
that's no longer practical.

53:05.061 --> 53:08.224
So I did the next best thing.

53:09.132 --> 53:13.899
I brought the prison
cell here, stone by stone.

53:15.371 --> 53:18.363
Just for you, Michael.
Just for you.

53:18.808 --> 53:20.298
I'm flattered.

53:21.077 --> 53:23.068
Why don't we
just talk business?

53:23.213 --> 53:25.443
Business?
Oh, this is business.

53:26.316 --> 53:28.307
It might be
interesting to note,

53:28.384 --> 53:31.820
along with the stones, I
received an unexpected bonus:

53:33.089 --> 53:34.556
African rats.

53:35.291 --> 53:37.350
Just like the ones
who chewed at me.

53:37.427 --> 53:39.258
They breed quickly,

53:39.529 --> 53:41.588
and will stop at nothing
to feed their young.

53:42.398 --> 53:45.231
Make friends with them
if you can, Michael.

53:45.935 --> 53:48.335
I want you to
release Devon and April.

53:50.106 --> 53:51.471
You got me.

53:52.141 --> 53:53.972
That's what you want,
isn't it?

53:54.043 --> 53:58.275
Yes! But I want you to suffer
in every way imaginable.

53:59.349 --> 54:01.681
My possession of Devon Miles
and April Curtis

54:01.784 --> 54:03.274
causes you great anguish.

54:03.386 --> 54:06.378
How could I possibly
deny myself that pleasure?

54:09.525 --> 54:11.288
Guards, I'm through.

54:12.862 --> 54:16.559
Until the rats have
all begun to breed,

54:18.134 --> 54:19.499
sleep well,

54:21.404 --> 54:22.769
my brother.

54:44.928 --> 54:47.226
I want to speak
to Michael. Michael Knight.

54:47.297 --> 54:49.595
Uh, please tell him
it's important.

54:50.366 --> 54:51.958
Well, do you
know where he is?

54:52.035 --> 54:53.832
I've got to talk to him.

54:53.937 --> 54:55.268
Christina?

54:56.139 --> 54:57.504
You startled me.

54:57.573 --> 54:59.370
I... I thought
you were going out.

54:59.442 --> 55:02.775
I was,
but then I realized

55:03.279 --> 55:06.271
how little time
we have together. Sit.

55:10.253 --> 55:13.154
Christina, is something
bothering you?

55:14.490 --> 55:17.050
No, really, I'm... I'm fine.

55:18.561 --> 55:22.588
If something is bothering
you, you can talk to me.

55:23.399 --> 55:25.867
After all, we are family.

55:26.903 --> 55:29.531
And there's no
closer bond than that.

55:30.106 --> 55:32.540
If you can't
trust family,

55:33.609 --> 55:35.509
then who can you trust?

55:41.050 --> 55:45.453
April, do you know a way
to switch off this key light,

55:45.521 --> 55:47.716
and then turn it on again?

55:48.858 --> 55:51.850
I think a bobby pin
should do the trick.

55:51.995 --> 55:53.087
Good.

55:58.401 --> 55:59.595
What are
you thinking?

55:59.669 --> 56:01.569
I'm thinking
I wish some of my old friends

56:01.637 --> 56:04.265
from the UXB unit in England
were here now.

56:05.008 --> 56:06.839
They learned a great deal
about bombs.

56:06.909 --> 56:08.877
They even invented
a few of their own,

56:08.945 --> 56:11.243
including Spies' Bread,
for instance.

56:11.314 --> 56:12.713
Spies' Bread?

56:12.882 --> 56:14.645
I remember that, yes.

56:14.917 --> 56:17.647
When RAF pilots
were imprisoned in Germany,

56:17.754 --> 56:21.554
they used to escape
by making a kind of dough

56:21.624 --> 56:23.285
out of articles of clothing,

56:23.359 --> 56:26.624
and then they would use
electricity to detonate it.

56:28.064 --> 56:30.225
Shall we,
as the English say,

56:30.299 --> 56:31.630
uh, have a go at it?

56:31.701 --> 56:33.168
Of course, old boy.

56:33.536 --> 56:34.969
It's rather a long shot,

56:35.038 --> 56:36.562
but we do have
plenty of water.

56:36.639 --> 56:38.334
What we need now
is a base.

56:38.474 --> 56:40.339
A base. A base.
A base.

56:41.310 --> 56:43.938
If only we still wore
those, uh, celluloid collars.

56:44.013 --> 56:45.742
That alone
could blow us out.

56:45.848 --> 56:48.874
Wait a minute. Aren't these
made of a similar material?

56:48.985 --> 56:52.148
We can use this glass to shave
the stays into smaller pieces.

56:52.255 --> 56:53.222
Good.

57:03.232 --> 57:05.962
But we still need
the flour for the dough.

57:06.903 --> 57:08.700
What about
the lining of your jacket?

57:08.771 --> 57:10.261
It's made of an acrylic.

57:10.339 --> 57:11.897
Yes, but first
we need something

57:11.974 --> 57:15.410
that can be crushed into a
powder to create combustion.

57:16.279 --> 57:18.577
I bought this
sweater in India.

57:18.748 --> 57:20.875
They use malimite
for the buttons.

57:21.017 --> 57:24.544
The malimite! The malimite
could act as an oxidizer.

57:26.456 --> 57:27.923
There we are.

58:12.168 --> 58:13.760
But, Michael, I don't understand

58:13.836 --> 58:14.996
how that's gonna help.

58:15.071 --> 58:16.595
There's no time to explain.

58:16.672 --> 58:18.799
I want you to start
recording everything.

58:18.875 --> 58:19.899
Are you with me?

58:19.976 --> 58:22.069
At this point, I'll try anything.

58:28.651 --> 58:29.879
Very good.

58:29.986 --> 58:32.887
I love a man that can
do two things at once.

58:33.456 --> 58:36.653
I'm glad to see I'm not the only
one that couldn't sleep tonight.

58:36.726 --> 58:40.389
It's a pity.
I love to watch men sleep.

58:41.531 --> 58:45.365
I like to fantasize what
they're dreaming about, or who.

58:45.434 --> 58:47.925
Why don't you just
get to the point?

58:48.704 --> 58:50.569
One point at a time,
Michael.

58:50.706 --> 58:52.571
You know what
I'm talking about.

58:52.642 --> 58:55.236
Those feelings that you get
when you dream about somebody

58:55.311 --> 58:56.972
in the romantic sense.

58:57.046 --> 59:00.504
Somebody you might not have
even thought about in weeks.

59:00.716 --> 59:04.152
It puts you into a kind of
mood for the rest of the day.

59:04.954 --> 59:06.251
Those are the kind of dreams

59:06.322 --> 59:08.313
I've been having
about you, Michael.

59:08.424 --> 59:10.415
Only, I've been having them
almost every night

59:10.526 --> 59:11.493
since we last met.

59:12.762 --> 59:15.629
It's made my mood
very strong.

59:15.698 --> 59:17.996
Where does Garthe
fit into those moods?

59:18.067 --> 59:20.228
He fits in a different mood.

59:21.737 --> 59:24.331
You see,
I'm a woman of varied tastes.

59:26.609 --> 59:28.008
It's amazing,

59:28.844 --> 59:31.540
the resemblance
between you and Garthe.

59:32.515 --> 59:34.847
You're like flip sides
of a coin,

59:35.585 --> 59:37.450
opposites to the core:

59:38.221 --> 59:41.213
one good, one evil.

59:42.191 --> 59:44.921
I'm curious to see
which one I'll prefer.

59:45.561 --> 59:47.188
What are you
talking about?

59:47.263 --> 59:49.629
I'm talking about you.
Your future.

59:50.299 --> 59:52.267
Will it be life
or death?

59:52.969 --> 59:54.766
If it's left up
to Garthe alone,

59:54.837 --> 59:55.826
it will be death.

59:57.006 --> 01:00:00.134
Fortunately for you,
it's not up to him alone.

01:00:01.344 --> 01:00:04.507
If you please me,
I may have you spared.

01:00:05.181 --> 01:00:08.014
You see, once Garthe and I
conclude our project tomorrow,

01:00:08.117 --> 01:00:11.780
I'll have more money than I
could ever possibly spend alone.

01:00:11.921 --> 01:00:13.684
I'll need some help.

01:00:14.824 --> 01:00:16.587
I'm sure Garthe will
give you all the help

01:00:16.659 --> 01:00:18.251
you need in that department,

01:00:18.561 --> 01:00:20.085
if you succeed.

01:00:21.497 --> 01:00:23.260
Oh, we will succeed.

01:00:23.833 --> 01:00:25.460
The question is,

01:00:25.534 --> 01:00:27.934
will you succeed
in staying alive?

01:00:32.475 --> 01:00:34.102
Kiss me, Michael.

01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:37.005
Convince me that
you're worth saving.

01:00:46.022 --> 01:00:47.990
That's nice for a start.

01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:50.058
Goodness gracious.

01:00:55.731 --> 01:00:59.861
Good evening, my friend.
My name's Karl.

01:01:01.537 --> 01:01:04.062
I hear you're
a tough nut to crack.

01:01:05.141 --> 01:01:08.133
Well, let me tell you,
I'm a tough nutcracker.

01:01:12.581 --> 01:01:14.674
So that's the way
it's going to be.

01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:17.114
All right,
have it your own way.

01:01:17.586 --> 01:01:19.053
But let me warn you:

01:01:19.155 --> 01:01:22.591
I will strip your defenses
one by one,

01:01:23.025 --> 01:01:24.549
and in the end,

01:01:24.727 --> 01:01:28.094
I will transplant your central
processing unit to Goliath.

01:01:44.914 --> 01:01:48.111
I think it is time
we ended this little charade.

01:01:49.218 --> 01:01:51.709
I was, uh, just looking for...

01:01:51.821 --> 01:01:53.880
Some kind
of identification.

01:01:54.256 --> 01:01:57.225
Don't bother. Everything
is in perfect order,

01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.786
right down to the pretty
dollar bills from the Bahamas

01:02:00.863 --> 01:02:03.798
your uncle keeps in
his wallet for good luck.

01:02:04.433 --> 01:02:06.924
Who are you?
Where's my uncle?

01:02:07.937 --> 01:02:11.236
Let's just say that I'm
part of a very complex plan.

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:14.941
A plan that will go smoothly,
no matter what.

01:02:15.878 --> 01:02:18.904
It's been quite obvious
ever since this afternoon

01:02:18.981 --> 01:02:21.575
that you had your
suspicions about me.

01:02:22.284 --> 01:02:25.310
I think it's time we lay
our cards on the table.

01:02:26.222 --> 01:02:28.190
What do you want from me?

01:02:30.292 --> 01:02:32.089
Very little,
actually.

01:02:32.828 --> 01:02:35.820
Just your smile,
your silence,

01:02:36.766 --> 01:02:38.563
and your cooperation.

01:02:38.968 --> 01:02:41.937
If you try to escape
or alert anyone,

01:02:42.872 --> 01:02:46.205
your uncle will suffer.
Is that clear?

01:02:52.047 --> 01:02:56.347
Now all we need now is something
that's conductive to electricity.

01:02:57.286 --> 01:03:01.154
I think I will
have the mattress wire for you

01:03:01.357 --> 01:03:02.722
in a moment.

01:03:04.627 --> 01:03:05.719
April.

01:03:34.623 --> 01:03:37.387
Get back.
Cover your eyes!

01:03:41.297 --> 01:03:42.229
Ready?

01:03:42.298 --> 01:03:43.287
Ready.

01:03:50.406 --> 01:03:51.668
Let's go.

01:03:59.448 --> 01:04:03.976
So, the great escape
concludes.

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.647
Neither great
nor successful.

01:04:07.089 --> 01:04:08.283
Guards!

01:04:08.624 --> 01:04:10.524
Well,
it was a good try.

01:04:11.026 --> 01:04:12.926
Take them
to their room.

01:04:14.597 --> 01:04:16.189
Take a good look.

01:04:16.532 --> 01:04:18.625
You'll never
see them again.

01:04:40.055 --> 01:04:41.420
Good morning.

01:04:41.524 --> 01:04:43.492
What makes you think so?

01:04:44.527 --> 01:04:46.620
If you'd gotten
up at a decent hour,

01:04:46.695 --> 01:04:49.129
you'd know the submarine's
gonna be late.

01:04:49.598 --> 01:04:52.567
It's being delayed
by an American destroyer

01:04:52.635 --> 01:04:56.298
on maneuvers off
the international boundary.

01:04:56.472 --> 01:04:58.997
Well, you're in
a good mood as usual.

01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:01.172
By the way,
for your information,

01:05:01.243 --> 01:05:04.212
I'm not responsible for the
movements of the United States Navy.

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:08.011
No! And you're not responsible
for Michael Knight, either.

01:05:08.584 --> 01:05:10.279
Stay away from him.

01:05:10.886 --> 01:05:12.854
How dare you tell me
what to do!

01:05:12.922 --> 01:05:15.015
If it weren't for me,
you'd still be in prison,

01:05:15.124 --> 01:05:17.820
and Goliath would still be a
burnt-out skeleton in the desert!

01:05:17.893 --> 01:05:20.987
You give yourself way too
much credit, don't you?

01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:23.657
I would've gotten out of
that prison without you,

01:05:23.732 --> 01:05:25.131
one way or another.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.895
I had a promise to keep.

01:05:26.969 --> 01:05:29.403
What, your revenge
against Michael Knight?

01:05:29.471 --> 01:05:31.769
It always comes back
to him, doesn't it?

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.503
My revenge is my business,
not yours.

01:05:36.045 --> 01:05:38.912
Your hate for him is
eating away inside of you.

01:05:38.981 --> 01:05:40.642
It makes you weak.

01:05:42.051 --> 01:05:43.518
You disgust me.

01:05:43.619 --> 01:05:45.678
And your lust for him
disgusts me.

01:05:49.892 --> 01:05:52.122
It's about time
you understood

01:05:52.194 --> 01:05:54.822
that my life does
not revolve around you.

01:05:54.897 --> 01:05:58.628
It was my will that forced
you to break me out of prison.

01:05:58.701 --> 01:06:02.102
It was my brilliance
that resurrected Goliath,

01:06:02.338 --> 01:06:06.399
and it was my planning
that captured Michael Knight.

01:06:07.242 --> 01:06:09.403
Michael. Out...

01:06:13.949 --> 01:06:15.075
of here.

01:06:16.085 --> 01:06:18.315
All right, Michael, what's next?

01:06:18.787 --> 01:06:19.913
Right.

01:06:20.756 --> 01:06:25.386
Find a "the" and splice it in
after the word "open. "

01:06:27.563 --> 01:06:28.757
The.

01:06:28.831 --> 01:06:30.662
I think that works, Michael.

01:06:30.733 --> 01:06:33.964
Good. I hope
the rest of the world does.

01:06:43.679 --> 01:06:45.010
Okay, pal.

01:06:45.214 --> 01:06:47.512
Get ready for
the performance of your life.

01:06:50.019 --> 01:06:51.350
Go for it.

01:06:51.487 --> 01:06:53.921
Guards! Open the door.

01:06:54.256 --> 01:06:56.486
I'm taking Michael
out of here.

01:07:05.834 --> 01:07:07.825
Oh, no!

01:07:56.952 --> 01:07:58.647
Michael! It worked!

01:07:58.754 --> 01:07:59.846
So far.

01:07:59.955 --> 01:08:02.788
Right now we're long on luck
and short on time.

01:08:02.858 --> 01:08:04.189
Where's the
hydraulic switch?

01:08:04.259 --> 01:08:06.056
On the sidewall.

01:08:09.932 --> 01:08:12.901
You have no idea
how helpless I felt up there.

01:08:12.968 --> 01:08:14.333
A technician named Karl

01:08:14.403 --> 01:08:17.201
kept trying to get into my
central processing unit last night.

01:08:17.272 --> 01:08:19.536
I had to use every ounce
of power to fight him off.

01:08:19.608 --> 01:08:21.337
Pop the hood, KITT!

01:08:25.214 --> 01:08:26.647
How do I look?

01:08:26.715 --> 01:08:28.238
I think you'll live.

01:08:28.350 --> 01:08:29.874
Looks like all Goliath did

01:08:29.984 --> 01:08:33.045
was loosen your main circuit
distribution panel.

01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:36.314
How's that feel?

01:08:43.131 --> 01:08:45.725
Wonderful. I feel alive again.

01:08:47.736 --> 01:08:50.933
Don't get carried away.
We're not out of here yet.

01:08:53.642 --> 01:08:57.134
All right, see if you can
locate Devon and April.

01:09:01.582 --> 01:09:03.551
They've been
moved to another room.

01:09:03.652 --> 01:09:04.710
It has a PA system.

01:09:04.819 --> 01:09:05.877
Good.

01:09:05.988 --> 01:09:10.185
Jam the waves and give me a direct
two-way from their PA speaker.

01:09:10.526 --> 01:09:12.153
Right away.

01:09:13.295 --> 01:09:15.729
Devon, April, can you hear me?

01:09:15.798 --> 01:09:16.890
Devon?

01:09:16.965 --> 01:09:18.591
April, can you hear me?

01:09:18.966 --> 01:09:20.992
Michael, where are you?

01:09:21.336 --> 01:09:23.997
I'm in the
garage. KITT's ready to roll.

01:09:24.072 --> 01:09:26.666
Now you sit tight. We'll find
a way to get you out of there.

01:09:26.742 --> 01:09:29.176
No, Michael. Wait a bit.
Get Christina first.

01:09:29.243 --> 01:09:30.336
But, Devon...

01:09:30.412 --> 01:09:31.470
That's an order.

01:09:31.546 --> 01:09:33.947
All right.
I'm coming back for you.

01:09:34.049 --> 01:09:35.983
And that's a promise.

01:09:36.051 --> 01:09:37.779
Good luck, Michael. Godspeed.

01:09:37.886 --> 01:09:40.046
Michael, how do you
intend to get us out of here?

01:09:40.154 --> 01:09:42.988
There's a rather
large obstacle in our way.

01:09:43.826 --> 01:09:46.158
Give me another
30 seconds, KITT.

01:09:48.363 --> 01:09:51.196
Michael, I detect
vehicles headed our way.

01:09:53.602 --> 01:09:57.265
I think that's our exit line.

01:10:10.953 --> 01:10:12.250
I'll get him!

01:10:12.321 --> 01:10:13.345
No! Not now.

01:10:13.455 --> 01:10:15.753
He'll come back
for his friends.

01:10:18.794 --> 01:10:20.659
Then it'll be my turn.

01:10:25.701 --> 01:10:27.669
Brace yourself, Michael.

01:10:30.906 --> 01:10:33.898
Michael, I've never been
so happy to leave a place.

01:10:33.976 --> 01:10:36.809
Yeah. It's too bad
it's only a breather.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.277
Let's access Dr. Bergstrom's
itinerary for today, huh?

01:10:45.454 --> 01:10:48.423
He's scheduled to attend
a press conference at 10:30.

01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:51.050
Let's try and catch him
before he leaves the hotel.

01:11:54.156 --> 01:11:56.590
Surely you can
do better than that.

01:11:58.794 --> 01:12:00.421
Better than what?

01:12:00.896 --> 01:12:04.332
Your face is frozen.
You look like a statue.

01:12:05.901 --> 01:12:08.335
Unfortunately my major
wasn't theater arts.

01:12:08.403 --> 01:12:10.337
I can't smile on cue.

01:12:10.973 --> 01:12:14.568
No, but you can at least
look pleasant.

01:12:15.177 --> 01:12:16.201
Try.

01:12:17.045 --> 01:12:19.912
For your uncle's sake,
hmm?

01:12:35.731 --> 01:12:39.167
Christina! Dr. Bergstrom!

01:12:39.534 --> 01:12:40.523
I'm sorry.

01:12:40.602 --> 01:12:43.162
I know, but I'm such
a lousy tour guide.

01:12:43.238 --> 01:12:46.002
The least I could do is take
you to the press conference.

01:12:46.074 --> 01:12:48.736
Thank you, but I've already
made my arrangements.

01:12:48.810 --> 01:12:50.004
I'll bet you have.

01:12:50.078 --> 01:12:51.477
What are you doing?
Let me go!

01:12:51.546 --> 01:12:53.309
Give me that gun.
You okay?

01:12:53.382 --> 01:12:55.043
Hotel Security.
What's the problem here?

01:12:55.150 --> 01:12:56.344
This man's an imposter.

01:12:56.451 --> 01:12:57.975
This man is a maniac!
Do something!

01:12:58.086 --> 01:13:00.486
The real Dr. Bergstrom is
being held against his will.

01:13:00.555 --> 01:13:01.954
Ask his niece. Tell him.

01:13:02.024 --> 01:13:03.651
It's true.
This man isn't my uncle.

01:13:03.725 --> 01:13:05.716
He threatened to hurt him
if I said anything.

01:13:05.827 --> 01:13:06.953
That is a lie!

01:13:06.995 --> 01:13:08.860
Dr. Bergstrom
doesn't own a pistol.

01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:10.727
Here, take this.
Check the registration.

01:13:10.799 --> 01:13:12.596
If I'm wrong,
let him go.

01:13:12.667 --> 01:13:14.601
If I'm right,
turn him over to the police.

01:13:14.669 --> 01:13:16.296
Come with me,
sir.

01:13:20.342 --> 01:13:22.173
I thought you'd
forgotten about me.

01:13:22.244 --> 01:13:24.041
Never. I got delayed.

01:13:24.112 --> 01:13:25.272
Is Klaus all right?

01:13:25.347 --> 01:13:26.473
He's alive.

01:13:28.617 --> 01:13:29.845
Do psychologists pray?

01:13:29.951 --> 01:13:31.009
I do. Why?

01:13:31.119 --> 01:13:32.677
Make it a good one.

01:13:44.766 --> 01:13:48.133
KITT, monitor the transmissions
from the mansion, pal.

01:13:48.203 --> 01:13:50.103
When they make
their move with Klaus,

01:13:50.172 --> 01:13:53.141
we want to make sure we're
there for the going-away party.

01:13:53.208 --> 01:13:56.769
In this case, I believe
it's called party-crashing.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.812
You okay?
You're awful quiet.

01:14:00.916 --> 01:14:02.247
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:05.649
You know, I haven't even thanked you
for rescuing me from that, uh, that...

01:14:05.754 --> 01:14:08.018
Masquerading
misanthropic Klaus clone.

01:14:08.056 --> 01:14:09.318
Exactly.

01:14:09.391 --> 01:14:10.949
You don't
have to thank me.

01:14:11.026 --> 01:14:13.551
I just wanted to make sure
you'd be available for dinner

01:14:13.628 --> 01:14:14.856
after this is all over.

01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:16.397
If it's over.

01:14:17.566 --> 01:14:20.126
I'm so afraid I won't be
seeing Uncle Klaus again.

01:14:20.202 --> 01:14:21.726
You will, Christina.

01:14:21.803 --> 01:14:25.034
If it's humanly possible,
I promise you, you will.

01:14:30.779 --> 01:14:33.270
XL735, come in please.

01:14:35.150 --> 01:14:36.879
What's taking so long?

01:14:36.985 --> 01:14:41.854
I'm on approach,
due at K17 in 33 minutes.

01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:43.550
Over.

01:14:43.658 --> 01:14:44.955
We'll be there. Out.

01:14:50.699 --> 01:14:52.462
It's no use, Devon.

01:14:52.801 --> 01:14:56.134
Well, I'm afraid we've had the
only chance we're going to get.

01:14:56.738 --> 01:14:58.262
Good afternoon.

01:14:59.441 --> 01:15:00.840
You'll be happy
to know

01:15:00.909 --> 01:15:03.503
you won't be spending much
more time in this cracker box.

01:15:03.578 --> 01:15:04.840
Oh! Where are you taking us?

01:15:04.946 --> 01:15:06.277
Nowhere.

01:15:06.314 --> 01:15:09.112
As soon as we
remove Klaus Bergstrom,

01:15:09.217 --> 01:15:11.185
I will
overload the circuitry.

01:15:11.353 --> 01:15:13.617
The wires will melt down,

01:15:13.688 --> 01:15:15.622
and the house will
burst into flames.

01:15:16.625 --> 01:15:19.458
So will Devon Miles,
and my father's dream.

01:15:19.928 --> 01:15:23.091
You didn't include me.
An oversight?

01:15:23.265 --> 01:15:25.233
Oh, no, no, no.

01:15:25.467 --> 01:15:28.561
I find you much too
appealing to destroy.

01:15:28.637 --> 01:15:30.104
April is not one
of your trophies!

01:15:30.172 --> 01:15:31.605
She'll do
what I want her to.

01:15:31.673 --> 01:15:33.368
I have a right to
make my own decision!

01:15:33.441 --> 01:15:34.874
I wanna speak to you,
alone.

01:15:34.943 --> 01:15:35.932
April!

01:15:36.011 --> 01:15:37.808
Devon, please.
I'm a grown woman.

01:15:43.318 --> 01:15:44.808
Don't wait up.

01:15:52.961 --> 01:15:54.087
So,

01:15:55.197 --> 01:15:58.462
you want me. I'll go
with you on one condition:

01:15:59.234 --> 01:16:00.667
that you
release Devon.

01:16:00.735 --> 01:16:01.895
Never.

01:16:02.504 --> 01:16:05.496
An agreeable companion is better
than an unwilling prisoner.

01:16:05.607 --> 01:16:07.302
Oh, you'll be willing
soon enough.

01:16:07.342 --> 01:16:10.209
In a month you'll be following
me around like a hungry puppy.

01:16:10.278 --> 01:16:11.677
Let Devon go.

01:16:11.746 --> 01:16:13.407
Please,
he can't hurt you now!

01:16:13.481 --> 01:16:15.039
Nor will he ever again.

01:16:15.150 --> 01:16:17.084
You see, Devon Miles must die.

01:16:17.152 --> 01:16:19.086
Just as surely
as Michael Knight.

01:16:19.421 --> 01:16:21.981
In that case,
you might as well know

01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:24.354
what I think about you
and your destiny.

01:16:24.426 --> 01:16:27.987
Your destiny is to never have a
woman who wants you for yourself.

01:16:28.063 --> 01:16:31.055
To never have a man who
respects you for what you are.

01:16:31.132 --> 01:16:32.656
Your destiny is death

01:16:32.734 --> 01:16:34.031
and if you
don't believe me,

01:16:34.102 --> 01:16:36.002
just go take a good look
in the mirror.

01:16:36.071 --> 01:16:38.198
There are holes where
your eyes should be.

01:16:38.273 --> 01:16:41.140
And behind them
there's nothing but blackness.

01:16:49.784 --> 01:16:52.947
It's all right.
It's okay.

01:17:05.734 --> 01:17:08.897
Michael, I'm intercepting
a transmission to the mansion

01:17:08.970 --> 01:17:10.267
from a moving vehicle.

01:17:10.338 --> 01:17:11.600
What kind of vehicle?

01:17:11.673 --> 01:17:14.335
One approaching on
a course north by northwest.

01:17:14.409 --> 01:17:16.400
All right.
Let's get an exact location.

01:17:17.746 --> 01:17:20.271
43.5 miles
northwest of the mansion.

01:17:20.348 --> 01:17:21.474
Wait a minute.

01:17:21.583 --> 01:17:23.050
That's in
the middle of the ocean!

01:17:23.151 --> 01:17:25.642
24.6 miles
from shore to be exact,

01:17:25.754 --> 01:17:29.087
and approximately 200 feet
below the surface.

01:17:29.157 --> 01:17:30.624
Below the surface?

01:17:31.259 --> 01:17:32.521
A submarine!

01:17:32.594 --> 01:17:34.425
That's how they're
moving Klaus out.

01:17:34.496 --> 01:17:36.657
But a submarine, how can
we possibly stop them?

01:17:36.731 --> 01:17:39.928
They've got to get your uncle
from the mansion to the sub.

01:17:40.001 --> 01:17:41.730
That's where they're
gonna be vulnerable.

01:17:41.803 --> 01:17:43.634
Unless they take Goliath.

01:17:43.705 --> 01:17:46.299
Correction.
Even if they take Goliath.

01:18:48.570 --> 01:18:50.401
It's time to leave,
Dr. Bergstrom.

01:18:50.472 --> 01:18:52.303
Suppose I refuse to go.

01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:54.340
What will you do then?

01:18:56.644 --> 01:18:59.408
Force you.
Use whatever means necessary.

01:19:47.295 --> 01:19:49.820
Michael, there
appears to be a mass exodus

01:19:49.898 --> 01:19:51.525
from the mansion in progress.

01:19:51.599 --> 01:19:54.466
Good.
That'll make our job easier.

01:20:19.627 --> 01:20:20.616
Go!

01:20:37.545 --> 01:20:39.706
Our time has come,
my giant friend.

01:20:40.482 --> 01:20:42.450
This time there
will be no doubt.

01:20:42.517 --> 01:20:44.508
This time we will succeed.

01:21:01.402 --> 01:21:03.267
Garthe's
overloaded the circuitry.

01:21:03.338 --> 01:21:05.135
We may only have minutes.

01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:08.236
Michael, wherever
you are, please hurry.

01:21:10.044 --> 01:21:12.012
KITT, give me a reading!

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:15.447
My magnetic analyzer
indicates excessive electrical current

01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:17.711
from the communications room.

01:21:22.690 --> 01:21:25.158
Michael, the
house is ready to explode!

01:21:25.226 --> 01:21:26.420
Take care of her!

01:21:26.494 --> 01:21:27.552
Michael, wait!

01:21:49.484 --> 01:21:51.418
KITT,
I don't know where to start.

01:21:51.486 --> 01:21:53.511
Is there a main
source I can knock out?

01:21:53.621 --> 01:21:56.784
The breaker box on
the far wall, near the window.

01:22:19.981 --> 01:22:22.211
Devon! April!

01:22:24.719 --> 01:22:26.186
Where are you?

01:22:26.754 --> 01:22:28.619
Devon! April!

01:22:30.325 --> 01:22:32.418
Michael, we're in here!

01:22:32.594 --> 01:22:33.686
Michael!

01:22:33.761 --> 01:22:35.558
We're in here!

01:22:39.901 --> 01:22:42.199
I've never been so glad
to see anyone in my life!

01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:44.431
Thank God you're here.
And not a moment too soon.

01:22:44.505 --> 01:22:45.563
They've got Bergstrom.

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:46.766
When did
they leave?

01:22:46.841 --> 01:22:48.172
Barely minutes ago.

01:22:48.242 --> 01:22:50.005
They've taken him
in Goliath.

01:22:50.078 --> 01:22:51.773
I had a feeling
they would.

01:22:52.513 --> 01:22:54.276
Devon, I could
use your help.

01:22:54.349 --> 01:22:56.510
The transmitters
in the communication room

01:22:56.618 --> 01:22:58.142
are still probably
operable.

01:22:58.252 --> 01:22:59.719
If they aren't,
I'll find a way.

01:22:59.787 --> 01:23:01.584
You'll get your help.
Count on it.

01:23:01.656 --> 01:23:03.214
I'm going to leave
Christina with you.

01:23:03.324 --> 01:23:04.951
Take good care of her.

01:23:13.668 --> 01:23:16.432
Michael, we've picked
up Goliath on the scanner.

01:23:16.504 --> 01:23:17.528
Good.

01:23:17.605 --> 01:23:18.663
Easy for you to say.

01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:20.731
They've got Bergstrom, KITT.

01:23:20.875 --> 01:23:23.105
Goliath's our last chance
to stop them.

01:23:23.177 --> 01:23:25.441
Or their last chance to stop us.

01:23:37.225 --> 01:23:38.590
Do you have to do that?

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:40.525
Why announce our presence
to the world?

01:23:40.595 --> 01:23:43.393
Why not?
What are you afraid of?

01:23:44.065 --> 01:23:47.262
I want the whole world
to witness my triumph.

01:24:17.565 --> 01:24:21.160
How thoughtful.
A police escort.

01:24:21.969 --> 01:24:23.834
You in that freight,

01:24:23.905 --> 01:24:25.964
pull over to
the side of the road.

01:24:26.441 --> 01:24:27.931
Get rid of him!

01:24:28.076 --> 01:24:30.044
So cold and so ruthless.

01:24:30.578 --> 01:24:33.672
Did I ever tell you,
you remind me of my mother?

01:24:37.652 --> 01:24:38.846
I repeat.

01:24:38.953 --> 01:24:42.582
Pull that freight over to
the side of the road now!

01:25:20.795 --> 01:25:22.820
Michael, Devon's calling.

01:25:23.064 --> 01:25:26.056
Devon!
Any luck with Gen. Maddux?

01:25:26.134 --> 01:25:28.898
Yes. He agreed to
alert an Army reserve unit.

01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:31.530
They're setting up a
roadblock near Comstock Road.

01:25:31.606 --> 01:25:33.301
It better be a big one.

01:25:33.374 --> 01:25:35.968
Goliath eats roadblocks
for breakfast.

01:25:36.744 --> 01:25:38.905
How's Christina holding up?

01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:41.710
Well, very well under
the circumstances.

01:25:42.183 --> 01:25:43.343
Good luck, Michael.

01:25:44.018 --> 01:25:45.178
Thanks.

01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:50.384
Bring that rock truck
into position.

01:25:54.195 --> 01:25:55.924
Move that truck in!

01:25:56.631 --> 01:25:58.758
Here they
come! Everybody spread out!

01:25:58.833 --> 01:26:00.494
Get into position!

01:26:41.242 --> 01:26:43.233
Determined, aren't they?

01:26:54.822 --> 01:26:58.258
Looks like Goliath had a little
appetizer before breakfast.

01:26:58.359 --> 01:26:59.519
My goodness.

01:27:11.772 --> 01:27:13.535
Michael, unlike that dinosaur,

01:27:13.608 --> 01:27:15.337
we can't simply
push our way through.

01:27:15.409 --> 01:27:17.036
I wouldn't dream of it, KITT.

01:27:17.111 --> 01:27:18.669
That's not our style.

01:27:38.399 --> 01:27:40.867
I love that feeling of power.

01:27:42.236 --> 01:27:45.034
Absolute power.
Just as you do.

01:27:45.106 --> 01:27:46.630
Don't touch me!

01:27:48.009 --> 01:27:51.103
I remember when you were
waiting outside my door,

01:27:51.178 --> 01:27:52.645
hungry for my touch,

01:27:52.713 --> 01:27:54.738
just because
I looked like him.

01:27:55.383 --> 01:27:57.783
Why settle for a copy when
you can have the original?

01:27:57.852 --> 01:28:01.219
He's a copy!
Don't you forget that.

01:28:07.962 --> 01:28:10.522
You have your chance
to finally prove that, Garthe.

01:28:10.865 --> 01:28:12.196
He's coming.

01:28:16.637 --> 01:28:19.834
Good. No parachute
will save him this time.

01:29:23.037 --> 01:29:24.595
Michael, those tanks.

01:29:24.672 --> 01:29:25.934
All right.

01:29:26.941 --> 01:29:28.374
Yes!

01:29:40.654 --> 01:29:43.555
Okay, KITT, get ready.

01:29:43.624 --> 01:29:45.091
Get ready for what?

01:29:45.192 --> 01:29:48.161
Need I remind you
Goliath is now invulnerable?

01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:50.322
We got to get
Bergstrom out of there.

01:29:50.398 --> 01:29:52.866
Scan the trailer
for any signs of life.

01:29:52.933 --> 01:29:55.527
You're right, Michael.
There is someone inside.

01:30:07.214 --> 01:30:08.738
He's right behind us.

01:30:08.849 --> 01:30:10.544
What do you think he's doing?

01:30:10.651 --> 01:30:12.312
He's after Dr. Bergstrom.

01:30:34.075 --> 01:30:35.667
Michael, thank God!

01:30:35.743 --> 01:30:36.835
Are you okay?

01:30:36.911 --> 01:30:37.935
I think so.

01:30:38.012 --> 01:30:39.036
Can you walk?

01:30:39.113 --> 01:30:40.137
Yes.

01:30:43.084 --> 01:30:44.176
It's okay. Come on.

01:31:00.468 --> 01:31:02.095
All right, give it to me!

01:31:16.717 --> 01:31:18.184
He's got Bergstrom!

01:31:18.252 --> 01:31:20.083
For the moment,
dear Adrianne.

01:31:20.387 --> 01:31:21.877
For the moment.

01:31:50.618 --> 01:31:51.812
Let them go!

01:31:51.919 --> 01:31:53.784
There's still time
for us to escape!

01:31:53.854 --> 01:31:55.446
For us to escape?

01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:58.857
I don't escape, Adrianne.
I attack.

01:32:02.329 --> 01:32:04.320
Michael, we're headed directly

01:32:04.398 --> 01:32:06.093
toward an
extremely steep cliff.

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:07.360
How's your grappling hook?

01:32:07.401 --> 01:32:08.493
My grappling hook?

01:32:08.569 --> 01:32:10.264
Michael, what on
earth have you in mind?

01:32:10.337 --> 01:32:12.897
Hang on, Doctor.
This could be tricky.

01:33:02.756 --> 01:33:03.882
It's over.

01:33:04.024 --> 01:33:05.286
Thank God.

01:33:05.593 --> 01:33:08.061
Who was that... that madman?

01:33:08.162 --> 01:33:09.754
It's a long story.

01:33:16.971 --> 01:33:18.199
Nice work, pal.

01:33:18.272 --> 01:33:19.796
Thank you, Michael.

01:33:19.873 --> 01:33:21.465
Let's go home, huh?

01:33:33.988 --> 01:33:36.548
He shot it. It's gone forever.

01:33:37.524 --> 01:33:39.014
My Ming statue.

01:33:39.393 --> 01:33:41.861
My priceless Ming statue.
Why?

01:33:42.730 --> 01:33:44.357
For what purpose?

01:33:44.598 --> 01:33:47.863
Well, I think Garthe hated
anything beautiful.

01:33:47.935 --> 01:33:50.062
Anything he
couldn't possess.

01:33:50.804 --> 01:33:52.635
Well, I don't know,
Devon.

01:33:52.773 --> 01:33:54.832
Maybe this
a blessing in disguise.

01:33:55.109 --> 01:33:56.542
Now we can redecorate.

01:33:56.610 --> 01:33:57.736
Redecorate?

01:33:58.712 --> 01:34:00.873
What is wrong
with the way it was?

01:34:04.718 --> 01:34:08.313
All right, Devon, another one
of your wild toga parties, huh?

01:34:08.355 --> 01:34:10.186
That is not very funny,
Michael.

01:34:10.257 --> 01:34:11.815
Oh! Well,
I always thought

01:34:11.892 --> 01:34:14.793
the decor in here
was a little, well, dated.

01:34:14.962 --> 01:34:17.089
Dated?
What do you mean dated?

01:34:17.164 --> 01:34:20.463
Well, you know, I think the Foundation
can use a new image, you know.

01:34:20.534 --> 01:34:23.765
Maybe brighten up the
walls here, and, uh, yeah.

01:34:23.971 --> 01:34:26.235
We could put
a little skylight in here.

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:28.340
A-Absolutely not!

01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:30.904
No skylights,
no changed images.

01:34:30.978 --> 01:34:32.809
And if you know
what's good for you...

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:34.541
Just a suggestion!

01:34:35.516 --> 01:34:38.451
I know. How about
a hot tub in the corner?

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:53.824
Huh.

01:34:57.137 --> 01:34:58.126
Hey!

01:34:58.372 --> 01:34:59.805
How was the seminar?

01:34:59.873 --> 01:35:01.738
Oh, it was enjoyable.

01:35:02.176 --> 01:35:04.667
But when I compare it
to the last several days,

01:35:04.712 --> 01:35:07.272
laser technology
is very boring.

01:35:08.882 --> 01:35:11.874
Oh! This is a list of restaurants
that KITT's recommended.

01:35:11.985 --> 01:35:13.782
KITT's
recommending restaurants?

01:35:13.854 --> 01:35:15.651
He must be feeling better.

01:35:16.590 --> 01:35:18.080
I'll see you tonight.

01:35:18.292 --> 01:35:19.919
8:00 sharp.

01:35:20.094 --> 01:35:23.063
And he won't be late,
Christina. I'll see to it.

01:35:23.130 --> 01:35:24.597
Thanks, KITT.

01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:30.097
Come on, KITT,
you're making me look bad.

01:35:31.638 --> 01:35:34.471
What do you know
about restaurants, anyway?

01:35:34.708 --> 01:35:36.699
You'd be surprised.

01:35:47.721 --> 01:35:50.918
I sure hope that's the
last we see of Garthe and Goliath.

01:35:50.991 --> 01:35:52.458
So do I, Michael.

01:35:54.762 --> 01:35:55.888
What's that?

01:35:55.963 --> 01:35:58.261
I recorded it as a souvenir.

01:35:58.332 --> 01:36:00.732
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:36:00.801 --> 01:36:03.429
That's very funny.
Yes, that's very funny.

01:36:03.504 --> 01:36:06.439
As a matter of fact, I have a
little surprise for you, too.

01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:08.201
Please. No cliffs.

01:36:09.376 --> 01:36:10.900
Do you hear me?

01:36:13.113 --> 01:36:14.910
Michael, I'm serious.

01:36:18.352 --> 01:36:19.546
Michael.
