WEBVTT

00:02.683 --> 00:06.280
- And so, here is what I propose...
- We finish these, get some roadies,

00:06.282 --> 00:11.183
head back to my huge penthouse, drink
chilled champagne served by my valet...

00:11.185 --> 00:13.325
Isn't it pronounced valet?

00:13.327 --> 00:17.595
Only if he's parking your car,
then we slip into my new hot tub

00:17.715 --> 00:19.459
and, ya know, see where
the evening takes us.

00:19.461 --> 00:23.125
Well, I have to wait until my
friend comes back from the powder room...

00:23.127 --> 00:25.993
Well yeah, obviously we're
gonna wait for her, she's the hot one.

00:25.995 --> 00:29.732
Pig!

00:29.734 --> 00:31.583
I'm sorry, is something funny?

00:31.703 --> 00:34.298
Just that last part,
where she slapped you.

00:34.300 --> 00:34.799
Yeah?!

00:34.801 --> 00:37.201
You like physical humor?!

00:37.203 --> 00:39.367
Depends on the situation.

00:39.369 --> 00:40.134
Ow.

00:40.136 --> 00:41.102
You okay?

00:41.104 --> 00:43.537
No, I'm not oh -- oh my God!

00:43.539 --> 00:44.539
You're Burt Reynolds!

00:44.541 --> 00:45.640
Yes, yes I am.

00:45.642 --> 00:48.277
And if I let you up, are you
gonna do anything stupid?

00:48.279 --> 00:50.179
No, no I'm not.

00:50.181 --> 00:51.479
Hi, Sterling Archer.

00:51.481 --> 00:53.114
Sterling Archer?

00:53.116 --> 00:55.017
Yeah, you've heard of me, huh?

00:55.019 --> 00:57.586
Well, just from your --
Press clippings, yeah,

00:57.588 --> 00:59.154
it's pretty hard to stay
anonymous when you're the

00:59.156 --> 00:59.787
world's greatest secret agent.

00:59.789 --> 01:01.622
Calling
yourself that can't help.

01:01.624 --> 01:03.490
Hang on, true
story, Operation CIA?

01:03.492 --> 01:07.926
That movie's basically why I became
a secret agent in the first place!

01:07.928 --> 01:08.860
Really?

01:08.862 --> 01:10.228
That movie was just God-awful.

01:10.230 --> 01:12.796
What's awful is
I almost punched you!

01:12.798 --> 01:13.930
No you didn't.

01:13.932 --> 01:15.931
And I've seen all your
other movies like five times!

01:15.933 --> 01:20.167
Sam Whiskey, Navajo Joe, Fuzz,
Hooper, Shamus, Shark,

01:20.169 --> 01:23.036
The Longest Yard, Deliverance,
The Smokies, White Lightning,

01:23.038 --> 01:25.507
obviously Gator, uh, oh!

01:25.509 --> 01:29.277
I even saw At Long Last Love!

01:29.279 --> 01:30.478
I thought you were great!

01:30.480 --> 01:31.613
Really.

01:31.615 --> 01:33.615
Well, I wanted to.

01:33.617 --> 01:34.549
Me too.

01:34.551 --> 01:37.119
Listen, I kinda have a date.

01:37.121 --> 01:38.921
No no no wait wait wait!

01:38.923 --> 01:44.327
Sorry. Lemme buy you a drink, I wanna
tell you my idea for a Gator sequel!

01:44.329 --> 01:45.828
Gator was a sequel.

01:45.830 --> 01:48.865
I Know, and this will be the
final chapter in The McClusky Trilogy!

01:48.867 --> 01:50.166
Trilogy. Huh.

01:50.168 --> 01:52.768
With twice as
many airboats as Gator!

01:52.770 --> 01:54.571
Twice
as many would be none?

01:54.573 --> 01:57.073
What're you talking about, Gator had--
Speedboats.

01:57.075 --> 01:57.540
Not airboats.

01:57.542 --> 01:58.475
Really, are you sure?

01:58.477 --> 01:59.609
Pretty sure.

01:59.611 --> 02:00.444
I directed it.

02:00.446 --> 02:03.646
I -- okay, but this one has
airboats, and they're central to the plot,

02:03.648 --> 02:05.615
And it sounds
great, kid, but like I said,

02:05.617 --> 02:07.383
- I kinda have a date, so...
- I get it.

02:07.385 --> 02:11.220
You gonna take her upstairs and
give her "the longest yard"?

02:11.222 --> 02:12.555
Yoo-hooooo!

02:12.557 --> 02:13.556
Mother?!

02:13.558 --> 02:14.824
What are you doing here?!

02:14.826 --> 02:16.859
What are you doing here?!

02:16.861 --> 02:21.129
- I'm kicking it with -- Burt? Oh no...
- Yeah so...

02:21.131 --> 02:23.498
remember how I said I kinda had a date?

02:23.500 --> 02:26.967
It's kinda with your mom.

02:26.969 --> 02:29.560
Hope that's not gonna be a problem.

03:08.133 --> 03:09.066
Oh please!

03:09.068 --> 03:12.169
Burt Reynolds didn't give you
a black eye, the floor did!

03:12.171 --> 03:13.838
When you fainted like a schoolgirl!

03:13.840 --> 03:16.540
It was an involuntary
reaction, mother!

03:16.542 --> 03:21.112
To seeing you all tarted up to meet
my hero in a hotel bar for sex!

03:21.114 --> 03:23.515
Oh for -- we
were meeting for drinks!

03:23.517 --> 03:26.986
I mean obviously sex was implied, but--
Ugh!

03:26.988 --> 03:28.521
And since when is he your hero?

03:28.523 --> 03:30.023
Wh-? Since always!

03:30.025 --> 03:32.625
Eeeast bound and doowwn!

03:32.627 --> 03:34.427
I thought that
was Richard Petty.

03:34.429 --> 03:36.362
Which doesn't
even merit a response.

03:36.364 --> 03:38.063
And you cannot date Burt Reynolds!

03:38.065 --> 03:40.666
Can, am, and
will continue to do so.

03:40.668 --> 03:42.501
I'm serious, I'll
do something drastic!

03:42.503 --> 03:43.369
You will not.

03:43.371 --> 03:46.038
Mainly because you've got
bigger things to worry about.

03:46.040 --> 03:50.042
I'll be the judge of -- a Cuban
hit squad is in New York to kill me?!

03:50.044 --> 03:50.675
Apparently.

03:50.677 --> 03:52.144
This intel's a week old!

03:52.146 --> 03:53.812
Why are you just telling
me about it now?!

03:53.814 --> 03:59.083
- Because... Pick up Sterling, pick up, pick--
- Mmyello?

03:59.085 --> 04:00.285
Sterling dear, it's me.

04:00.287 --> 04:02.053
There's a --
Ha! Voicemail.

04:02.055 --> 04:02.754
You know what to do.

04:02.756 --> 04:03.989
Oh for God's sake.

04:03.991 --> 04:04.589
Hello?

04:04.591 --> 04:07.158
Sterling, dear it's me.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.495
Hold on, hold on!

04:10.497 --> 04:11.730
Hang on.

04:11.732 --> 04:12.697
Sterling.

04:12.699 --> 04:15.166
Don't hang up.

04:15.168 --> 04:16.233
Hello.

04:16.236 --> 04:19.337
Sterling it's --
Elaborate voicemail hoax.

04:19.339 --> 04:22.707
Leave it.

04:22.709 --> 04:25.243
And then I just sort
of forgot about it, because

04:25.245 --> 04:29.013
that same night, I met --
Burt Reynoooolds!

04:29.015 --> 04:31.049
Is on line oooone!

04:31.051 --> 04:33.585
For you, for some reason.

04:33.587 --> 04:36.587
Burt dear, what
a lovely surprise!

04:36.589 --> 04:38.389
I'm sitting
here with just a mustache

04:38.391 --> 04:39.857
and memories of last night.

04:39.859 --> 04:42.393
- Oh, Burt...
- Rrrgh!

04:42.395 --> 04:43.794
and also a blanket.

04:43.796 --> 04:46.697
The AC in my room's stuck on... freeze.

04:46.699 --> 04:51.602
Deliverance, Gator,
and this is him in Cosmoooh!

04:51.604 --> 04:53.704
How totally hot is he?!

04:53.706 --> 04:57.407
I swear to God, you could drown
a toddler in my panties right now.

04:57.409 --> 05:00.444
I mean not that you would, but --
Hey!

05:00.446 --> 05:01.145
Shut up!

05:01.147 --> 05:03.113
You're not my supervisor!

05:03.115 --> 05:05.115
Wait, who is my supervis--
Carol!

05:05.117 --> 05:05.749
Oh right.

05:05.751 --> 05:08.385
Go get my gray
fox out of cold storage.

05:08.387 --> 05:13.556
Burt Reynolds is taking me to a movie
premiere tonight, so -- help me God,

05:13.558 --> 05:16.526
if you throw that computer on
the floor again you'll wake up

05:16.528 --> 05:21.197
in a mental ward with total amnesia
under someone else's name.

05:21.199 --> 05:23.065
That's actually kinda scary.

05:23.067 --> 05:23.733
Eh.

05:23.735 --> 05:25.034
Wouldn't be the first time.

05:25.036 --> 05:28.070
Archer, hey, about this expense report--
Not now, Cyril!

05:28.072 --> 05:31.474
Mother is ruining what remains
of my life before a Cuban hit

05:31.476 --> 05:33.843
squad assassinates me, so --
MaÂ¡talo!

05:33.845 --> 05:35.778
Wh-?!

05:35.780 --> 05:37.512
Yeah laugh it up, Lana.

05:37.514 --> 05:38.080
I am.

05:38.082 --> 05:40.081
You almost got
shot in the face.

05:40.083 --> 05:40.682
Get off.

05:40.684 --> 05:41.449
You get off.

05:41.451 --> 05:42.183
Cyril.

05:42.185 --> 05:43.050
I'm pretty tense right now.

05:43.052 --> 05:44.218
Because of the Cubans?

05:44.220 --> 05:47.188
Or because Burt Reynolds
is doing your mom?

05:47.190 --> 05:48.789
Yeah, laugh it up!

05:48.791 --> 05:49.990
I am!

05:49.992 --> 05:53.594
Burt Reynolds is actually banging --
Archer!

05:53.596 --> 05:55.128
You broke my frickin nose!

05:55.130 --> 05:57.364
- What's that?
- Sorry, I can't hear you over the sound

05:57.366 --> 05:58.866
of I broke your nose!

05:58.868 --> 06:02.202
Bullying Cyril isn't gonna make
Burt Reynolds stop shtupping your mom.

06:02.204 --> 06:03.704
He's not... doing that!

06:03.706 --> 06:06.340
But even if he is, which he is --
No he isn't!

06:06.342 --> 06:08.275
This Cuban hit squad is no joke.

06:08.277 --> 06:10.912
So if I were you, I'd lay low in
the safehouse for a few days,

06:10.914 --> 06:12.747
until we work out a plan
to neutralize them.

06:12.749 --> 06:14.348
Ohh! Yeah, okay!

06:14.350 --> 06:15.349
The safehouse!

06:15.351 --> 06:18.819
I'm sorry, your words made sense,
but your sarcastic tone did not.

06:18.821 --> 06:21.154
Because there are no Cubans!

06:21.156 --> 06:25.191
Mother just wants me out of the way so she can...
do unspeakable things with

06:25.193 --> 06:26.258
Burt Reynolds!

06:26.260 --> 06:28.560
So nice try, idiot!

06:28.562 --> 06:32.997
- I love it that I'm the idiot...
- So unless the building

06:32.999 --> 06:35.834
is literally on fire, none
of you are to call me.

06:35.836 --> 06:38.704
Because, as I may have mentioned--
Fifty times.

06:38.706 --> 06:41.640
-- tonight I will be attending
a movie premiere with Burt Reynolds.

06:41.642 --> 06:43.576
Oh my God,
that totally reminds me!

06:43.578 --> 06:44.744
This came for you.

06:44.746 --> 06:45.211
From him.

06:45.213 --> 06:46.312
And you opened it?!

06:46.314 --> 06:47.947
That's how
I knew it was from him.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.382
Give me that!

06:49.384 --> 06:54.120
"Dear Malory, it's been --"

06:54.122 --> 06:57.290
Dear Malory, it's been real,
but I'm dumping you for a young

06:57.292 --> 07:00.793
starlet and heading back to Tinseltown.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.161
Do not contact me.

07:02.163 --> 07:04.163
Regards, Burt Reynolds.

07:04.165 --> 07:05.330
"Regards!"

07:05.332 --> 07:07.465
They weren't even warmest!

07:07.467 --> 07:10.301
Wait a -- who
calls it Tinseltown?

07:10.303 --> 07:11.169
Carol Channing?

07:11.171 --> 07:15.006
Or somebody who just thinks
that's what movie stars call Hollywood.

07:15.008 --> 07:16.640
Stockard Channing?

07:16.642 --> 07:17.208
Archer.

07:17.210 --> 07:19.410
His mother, dating his mancrush?

07:19.412 --> 07:20.777
I bet Archer kidnapped him.

07:20.779 --> 07:21.512
But how?

07:21.514 --> 07:26.316
- Archer goes to Burt's hotel room...
- Knocks him out...

07:26.318 --> 07:26.950
Archer?

07:26.952 --> 07:28.685
Knocks out Burt Reynolds?!

07:28.687 --> 07:31.655
- With gas...
- Oh shit.

07:31.657 --> 07:33.256
And then hides him somewhere.

07:33.258 --> 07:35.191
Like an idiot kid
hiding a lamp he broke.

07:35.193 --> 07:36.859
You really think he'd do that?

07:36.861 --> 07:38.227
Yes, really.

07:38.229 --> 07:41.597
I'm serious, if you ever go near
to my mother again I will...

07:41.599 --> 07:43.632
do something really bad.

07:43.634 --> 07:45.167
Well, then
you should probably just

07:45.169 --> 07:46.168
go ahead and get it over with.

07:46.170 --> 07:48.036
Don't worry, I -- wait, what?

07:48.038 --> 07:50.739
Because if you
don't kill me, and I get loose?

07:50.741 --> 07:54.776
You're gonna wish you were in
hell with your back broke.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.946
I don't...
have a response to that.

07:56.948 --> 07:58.273
They never do...

08:03.876 --> 08:06.545
It's my own fault,
I should've known!

08:06.547 --> 08:09.214
They tell you they love you,
and then they just cast you

08:09.216 --> 08:13.585
aside when some young starlet catches
their eye, with her perky little boobs!

08:13.587 --> 08:17.188
I bet they
were perky and big.

08:17.190 --> 08:18.088
Jeezow!

08:18.090 --> 08:19.890
Why are you torturing
her like that?!

08:19.892 --> 08:23.594
Why are you
asking rhetorical questions?

08:23.596 --> 08:26.630
- Aww, that's actually kinda sad...
- Alright, here's the plan,

08:26.632 --> 08:29.833
I say we go rescue Burt Reynolds, and as
a bonus, beat some sense into Archer's

08:29.835 --> 08:31.001
head and ass.

08:31.003 --> 08:31.601
Yeah!

08:31.603 --> 08:33.003
Right in the head and ass!

08:33.005 --> 08:35.138
So Pam, Carol,
stay here with Malory.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.940
Everybody else, let's go to Archer's.

08:36.942 --> 08:39.042
He's got a Cuban
hit squad after him.

08:39.044 --> 08:40.844
Why wouldn't he go to the safehouse?

08:40.846 --> 08:43.212
A, because he thinks
they're imaginary, and B,

08:43.215 --> 08:46.582
the safehouse doesn't have a --
New hot tub!

08:46.584 --> 08:49.786
Fifty jets, hand-hewn California
Redwood, no big deal...

08:49.788 --> 08:51.789
The California
Redwood is endangered.

08:51.791 --> 08:52.356
So?

08:52.358 --> 08:53.423
I already got my tub.

08:53.425 --> 08:54.491
Woodhouse, Burt Reynolds.

08:54.493 --> 08:55.693
Burt, Woodhouse.

08:55.695 --> 08:56.527
Hi.

08:56.529 --> 08:58.028
Loved you
in Gone With The Wind.

08:58.030 --> 08:59.997
Not him, shut
up, get him a drink.

08:59.999 --> 09:01.265
What's your poison?

09:01.267 --> 09:02.433
Pimm's Cup?

09:02.435 --> 09:05.135
Odd choice...
Well, this whole thing's pretty odd.

09:05.137 --> 09:05.969
What's odd!

09:05.971 --> 09:07.270
Is you wanting to date my mother!

09:07.272 --> 09:08.105
Why's that odd?

09:08.107 --> 09:09.206
Because you're you!

09:09.208 --> 09:12.510
- And she's, um... 
- Beautiful, smart, funny, successful...

09:12.512 --> 09:13.912
Like, one of those, tops.

09:13.914 --> 09:15.547
Not to
mention drop-dead sexy.

09:15.549 --> 09:16.548
Oh dear God yes.

09:16.550 --> 09:17.282
Woodhouse!

09:17.284 --> 09:18.917
I shall fetch a cucumber!

09:18.919 --> 09:20.452
You have to not date my mother.

09:20.454 --> 09:21.253
Can't do it.

09:21.255 --> 09:23.621
Can't, or --
Won't, whatever, pick one.

09:23.623 --> 09:25.256
Well then, here's
what's gonna happen.

09:25.258 --> 09:28.026
- You're gonna drink your Pimm's Cup...
- Which is exciting!

09:28.028 --> 09:28.627
Never had one!

09:28.629 --> 09:31.196
Then I'm gonna knock you out,
and you're gonna wake up in a

09:31.198 --> 09:33.732
mental hospital with total amnesia,
under someone else's name.

09:33.734 --> 09:36.101
Hey, now
there's an idea for a movie!

09:36.103 --> 09:37.235
Yeah, I think it already was.

09:37.237 --> 09:38.036
I wasn't in it.

09:38.038 --> 09:40.138
Well, maybe not, but--
Fade in!

09:40.140 --> 09:40.572
A mental ward!

09:40.574 --> 09:44.142
White walls, white sheets,
nurses in crisp white uniforms,

09:44.144 --> 09:48.513
broken men shuffle like zombies
we see a hospital wristband on

09:48.515 --> 09:50.448
a man's arm, John Doe.

09:50.450 --> 09:56.054
And we slowly tilt up, to see the man's face...
Gator McKlusky.

09:56.056 --> 09:59.424
And he's looking out the window,
the afternoon sun on his face,

09:59.426 --> 10:02.160
and there's a spark of recognition
in his eyes, cause you know what

10:02.162 --> 10:02.828
he's looking at?

10:02.830 --> 10:04.863
- No...
- The Okefenokee Swamp.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.265
There's a mental hospital there?

10:06.267 --> 10:07.600
Right on the water.

10:07.602 --> 10:10.069
And guess what's tied up
right out there at the dock?

10:10.071 --> 10:10.937
An airboat!

10:10.939 --> 10:13.206
And the head nurse falls in love
with him and finds out who

10:13.208 --> 10:15.609
he really is so she helps him
escape and they get chased by a

10:15.611 --> 10:18.245
bunch of dirty cops but
in the end they win!

10:18.247 --> 10:20.915
And you just
got a screenplay credit.

10:20.917 --> 10:21.616
For real?!

10:21.618 --> 10:24.585
Oh yeah, maybe even--
Your Pimm's Cup, sir.

10:24.587 --> 10:26.487
Doesn't it...
come in a silver chalice?

10:26.489 --> 10:26.954
Ah.

10:26.956 --> 10:28.856
That would be a pimp cup, sir.

10:28.858 --> 10:31.392
- Ohh...
- I hate to sound Hollywood,

10:31.394 --> 10:34.428
but could you put my Pimm's Cup in a--
Pimp Cup! Certainly!

10:34.430 --> 10:37.063
It would be an honor, Mr. Gable!

10:37.065 --> 10:38.098
Maybe even what?!

10:38.100 --> 10:39.466
Executive Producer.

10:39.468 --> 10:40.967
Executive producer?!

10:40.969 --> 10:43.803
But I'm not... Falling for that!

10:43.805 --> 10:44.537
You big liar!

10:44.539 --> 10:46.105
You're not gonna make that movie!

10:46.107 --> 10:47.240
Oh, I absolutely am.

10:47.242 --> 10:51.878
And once your ISIS buddies find out that
you kidnapped me and come find me,

10:51.880 --> 10:54.114
I'm gonna give them all an EP credit.

10:54.116 --> 10:55.248
No, you're not!

10:55.250 --> 10:57.618
So drink your stupid Pimm's Cup --
Yeah,

10:57.620 --> 10:58.552
where are we on that chalice?

10:58.554 --> 11:01.289
Because nobody
is coming for you, Burt!

11:01.291 --> 11:03.625
And especially nobody from ISIS!

11:03.627 --> 11:06.961
Okay, don't take
this the wrong way?

11:06.963 --> 11:10.031
But I'm kinda wondering how you're
gonna be an effective field agent.

11:10.033 --> 11:10.898
Interesting.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.500
Coming from a woman.

11:12.502 --> 11:13.667
Excuse me?

11:13.669 --> 11:14.968
Burn!

11:14.970 --> 11:15.769
Eh?

11:15.771 --> 11:17.304
Esto es Archer, no?

11:17.306 --> 11:20.673
Creo que se, pero...
esta paralizado?

11:20.675 --> 11:21.607
Al parecer.

11:21.609 --> 11:23.075
Sera mas faÂ¡cil, eh?

11:23.077 --> 11:24.443
El invaÂ¡lido.

11:24.445 --> 11:27.980
MaÂ¡talo!

11:27.982 --> 11:31.751
I mean don't get me wrong, I'm
all for affirmative action, but --

11:31.753 --> 11:34.320
Oh my God! Okay, first of all --
Hey guys?

11:34.322 --> 11:35.221
Hey guys?

11:35.223 --> 11:36.022
Zip it nerds!

11:36.024 --> 11:38.525
First of all, I was twice the agent
you were when your legs worked,

11:38.527 --> 11:40.361
so don't hand me that--
Shit!

11:40.363 --> 11:43.831
What the --
Duck!

11:43.833 --> 11:46.200
And this conversation isn't over!

11:46.202 --> 11:47.301
Isn't it?!

11:47.303 --> 11:48.301
No no no no!

11:48.303 --> 11:50.270
My brand-new van!

11:50.272 --> 11:51.371
Holy shit!

11:51.373 --> 11:53.372
Lana! Hang on!

11:53.374 --> 11:54.440
Cuban hit squad!

11:54.442 --> 11:55.541
I gotta go!

11:55.543 --> 11:56.875
Would you go?!

11:56.877 --> 11:57.876
I can't yet!

11:57.878 --> 12:01.212
And now I do
actually see your point.

12:01.214 --> 12:05.315
Krieger, go!

12:05.317 --> 12:07.618
ÃÂ¡Vamonos!

12:07.620 --> 12:08.118
Damn!

12:08.120 --> 12:11.689
Krieger can't outrun anything
with all that handicapped shit.

12:11.691 --> 12:12.790
I gotta go after them!

12:12.792 --> 12:14.659
But this conversation is not over!

12:14.661 --> 12:16.094
You'll never catch 'em.

12:16.096 --> 12:16.628
Yes I will!

12:16.630 --> 12:17.362
No you won't.

12:17.364 --> 12:19.131
I've seen you drive.

12:19.133 --> 12:21.100
You drive like an egg.

12:21.102 --> 12:22.902
You think you
can outdrive me?!

12:22.904 --> 12:24.571
And I'll bet on it.

12:24.573 --> 12:27.140
Go on... If I
don't catch 'em, I will just ride off

12:27.142 --> 12:29.976
- into the sunset... - Where they
don't have telephones to ever call my

12:29.978 --> 12:31.078
mother again, ever.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.713
On my word.

12:32.715 --> 12:35.815
- And if I do catch 'em...
- You keep dating my mother, yeah, got it.

12:35.817 --> 12:39.085
And since we've wasted a shitload of
time already, I feel pretty good about

12:39.087 --> 12:39.853
this bet.

12:39.855 --> 12:43.423
So let's do thiiis!

12:51.132 --> 12:52.898
You're kidding me.

12:52.900 --> 12:53.933
I know, it drives me nuts.

12:53.935 --> 12:55.734
It's like the world's slowest elevator.

12:55.736 --> 12:57.569
This is like the
world's slowest van!

12:57.571 --> 12:59.571
It's all this
handicapped shit!

12:59.573 --> 13:01.806
Jesus God, I get!

13:01.808 --> 13:06.344
Your point!

13:06.346 --> 13:07.746
You
should get a bat-pole.

13:07.748 --> 13:08.847
Nine thousand bucks.

13:08.849 --> 13:09.380
What?

13:09.382 --> 13:10.248
Lowest quote I got.

13:10.250 --> 13:11.449
That's ridiculous.

13:11.451 --> 13:14.352
For basically just putting a pole
where the garbage chute already is,

13:14.354 --> 13:17.422
but the co-op board was like "But
what'll we do with the garbage?"

13:17.424 --> 13:18.990
Yeah, but you
can still throw it down

13:18.992 --> 13:21.526
the, whatever, the same shaft.

13:21.528 --> 13:21.993
I know.

13:21.995 --> 13:24.329
And then you'd
have some garbage to land on.

13:24.331 --> 13:26.498
If you're coming in
hot, I know, it's a win-win.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.733
And you were
gonna pay for it yourself,

13:28.735 --> 13:30.168
no assessment or anything.

13:30.170 --> 13:32.337
Yep.

13:32.339 --> 13:33.305
Ridiculous.

13:33.307 --> 13:36.742
Preaching to the choir, buddy.

13:36.744 --> 13:38.243
That's
not your car, is it?

13:38.245 --> 13:39.478
Yeah, why?

13:39.480 --> 13:42.582
- Nothing, just...
- Didn't know they sold those to men.

13:42.584 --> 13:44.284
Yeah, laugh it up, Burt.

13:44.286 --> 13:45.285
I am.

13:51.059 --> 13:55.196
Aaaaaaaawwww shiiiiiiiiiiit!

13:55.198 --> 13:56.731
Burt it's too fast!

13:56.733 --> 13:57.632
Too fast!

13:57.634 --> 13:58.833
No such thing.

13:58.835 --> 13:59.734
Yes such thing!

13:59.736 --> 14:00.268
Slow down!

14:00.270 --> 14:01.703
Don't you
wanna help your friends?

14:01.705 --> 14:02.837
I don't care about them!

14:02.839 --> 14:04.038
Yes you do.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.908
You just pretend you don't,
because you're afraid of --

14:06.910 --> 14:09.010
Dying in this frickin car!

14:09.012 --> 14:10.645
Emotional intimacy.

14:10.647 --> 14:13.280
Oh my God, you --
You are such an asshole!

14:13.282 --> 14:16.417
Lana?! Lana, we're
coming to help, where are you?!

14:16.419 --> 14:19.086
- Heading north on the FDR at...
- 60th!

14:19.088 --> 14:21.088
Getting shot at by your damn Cubans!

14:21.090 --> 14:23.123
Which is totally not cool!

14:23.125 --> 14:23.723
Great!

14:23.725 --> 14:25.225
Tell her to keep going north!

14:25.227 --> 14:29.763
Doesn't matter, we can't catch
them, we're all the way acrawww shiiiit!

14:29.765 --> 14:30.764
We'll catch 'em.

14:30.766 --> 14:31.832
I know a shortcut.

14:31.834 --> 14:32.366
Wh-? How?!

14:32.368 --> 14:34.602
I did a TV
series here called Hawk.

14:34.604 --> 14:36.137
I forgot about Hawk.

14:36.139 --> 14:38.540
He was part Indian.

14:38.542 --> 14:42.278
Right!

14:42.280 --> 14:42.912
Whoo!

14:42.914 --> 14:44.948
Now it's officially a chase!

14:44.950 --> 14:47.750
Hooray...
You know what your problem is?

14:47.752 --> 14:48.384
My pants are wet?

14:48.386 --> 14:50.653
You only see
your mother as your mother.

14:50.655 --> 14:52.255
But she's also a person.

14:52.257 --> 14:55.425
She has hopes, dreams, fears... needs.

14:55.427 --> 14:56.459
Don't make it weirder!

14:56.461 --> 14:59.728
Not sexual needs
-- well, maybe those too--

14:59.730 --> 15:04.466
but personal, professional, all the
stuff that makes a person who they are.

15:04.468 --> 15:11.740
And until you -- oops, hang on.

15:11.742 --> 15:14.810
Holy shit, Burt Reynolds!

15:14.812 --> 15:17.913
Hey, if you'd pay attention
you might just learn something here.

15:17.915 --> 15:19.881
I'm sorry, I can't
hear you over the sound

15:19.883 --> 15:22.951
of my giant throbbing erection.

15:22.953 --> 15:23.918
Owww!

15:23.920 --> 15:24.819
How bout now?

15:24.821 --> 15:26.654
It's gone, I'm all ears.

15:26.656 --> 15:27.355
Good.

15:27.357 --> 15:30.992
Because my point is...
oh wait, wait, you're gonna wanna see this.

15:30.994 --> 15:32.460
See wh -- no!

15:32.462 --> 15:35.596
Burt noooo!

15:35.598 --> 15:38.099
Please don't do this.

15:38.101 --> 15:44.872
Oh shit!

15:44.874 --> 15:46.373
My pants are now literally wet.

15:46.375 --> 15:48.541
And my point is,
until you can look at your

15:48.543 --> 15:54.014
mother and see her not just as your
mother but as a person, a real person...

15:54.016 --> 15:56.983
you can't grow up.

15:56.985 --> 15:57.384
Huh.

15:57.386 --> 15:58.485
Food for thought.

15:58.487 --> 16:01.788
And if I were you I'd come to terms
with that, because I plan on seeing

16:01.790 --> 16:03.256
a lot of her.

16:03.258 --> 16:05.459
And uh, by "a lot of her"

16:05.461 --> 16:06.794
I mean --
I get it!

16:06.796 --> 16:11.966
But I guess you're outta luck, because
we had a -- Bet. God damn it.

16:11.968 --> 16:14.035
Now whaddya
say we have some fun?

16:14.037 --> 16:18.439
- Whatever...
- Oh my God, not the van.

16:18.441 --> 16:19.907
Will you please!

16:19.909 --> 16:22.176
Drive straight!

16:22.178 --> 16:27.282
No, serpentine, serpentine!

16:27.284 --> 16:28.516
Oh!

16:28.518 --> 16:29.551
Herroooh!

16:29.553 --> 16:33.255
- Herroh...
- Holy shit!

16:33.257 --> 16:34.657
It's Burt Reynolds!

16:34.659 --> 16:35.491
ÃÂ¡Buenas!

16:35.493 --> 16:37.326
Now watch what I do right here.

16:37.328 --> 16:38.994
Yeah duh, I only invented it.

16:38.996 --> 16:39.495
Oh.

16:39.497 --> 16:41.297
Nice to meet you, Hal Needham.

16:41.299 --> 16:44.700
Whatever.

16:50.106 --> 16:51.407
Ha haaaaa!

16:51.409 --> 16:52.941
That was actually pretty sweet.

16:52.943 --> 16:54.809
Uh-oh, looks
like we're in danger of a

16:54.811 --> 16:59.080
- frown turning upside-down...
- Cut it out, that tickles.

16:59.082 --> 17:05.219
Burt c'mon, seriously, cut it out--
Burt watch the goddamn road!

17:05.221 --> 17:07.154
Oh shit.

17:07.156 --> 17:07.954
Sorry about that.

17:07.957 --> 17:12.760
You should be,
that was totally irresp --

17:20.970 --> 17:24.172
Wait, was that the same footage?

17:24.174 --> 17:24.873
Thanks, Burt!

17:24.875 --> 17:26.375
Anytime, darlin!

17:26.377 --> 17:30.545
- But uh, you probably wanna go ahead
and slow down... - Oh, shit!

17:30.547 --> 17:31.946
Krieger, braaaakes!

17:31.948 --> 17:32.581
I am!

17:32.583 --> 17:35.850
They're not doing anything!

17:35.852 --> 17:37.452
A round must've
cut the brake line!

17:37.454 --> 17:39.454
That's okay, I got it!

17:39.456 --> 17:43.858
What do you
mean you gawww shiiit!

17:43.860 --> 17:47.596
Um...

17:50.200 --> 17:54.736
Hang on, everybody!

18:05.749 --> 18:08.651
Everybody okay?

18:08.653 --> 18:09.619
Okay?!

18:09.621 --> 18:11.721
No, we're not okay!

Thank you, Burt.

18:22.467 --> 18:27.936
Oh don't thank
me, thank -- oh, right.

18:27.938 --> 18:32.007
Now if you'll excuse me, I think we
can still make that movie premiere.

18:32.009 --> 18:36.545
You're taking
me to the premiere?!

18:36.547 --> 18:39.781
Leave me for some
hot little twenty year-old.

18:40.817 --> 18:43.084
I'll go find a ten year-old.

18:43.086 --> 18:45.454

would be delighted.

19:23.992 --> 19:25.759
