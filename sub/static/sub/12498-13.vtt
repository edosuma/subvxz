00:00.870 --> 00:03.030
I can see it in the way you look at me.

00:04.160 --> 00:08.550
You're thinking,"I don't agree with the choices that you've made,hannah.

00:09.220 --> 00:12.950
How could a young woman make such a muddle of her own life?

00:13.430 --> 00:16.239
" And that's your right to think those things.

00:17.290 --> 00:19.810
But it's also my right to insist,

00:19.820 --> 00:22.320
in this moment,that you hear me o.

00:23.510 --> 00:26.120
You punched me in the face,bitch.

00:27.830 --> 00:28.710
I did.

00:28.720 --> 00:33.100
in front of my children,in front of my ex-husband,in front of your own son.

00:33.110 --> 00:35.740
And for that,I was wrong.

00:36.540 --> 00:40.270
You and ray are welcome to go down whatever primrose path you choose.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.940
But I'm the mother of his children,

00:42.950 --> 00:45.170
and I'm not gonna let you take my boys with you.

00:45.180 --> 00:46.750
You see,that is where you're wrong,christine,?

00:46.760 --> 00:48.710
te equivocas porque because your boys are a part of this.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.440
How can they not be when I'm marrying their father?

00:52.910 --> 00:56.180
This is an invitation to an engagement party for me and ray.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.560
It's this saturday,

00:57.800 --> 00:59.090
and don't worry about R.S.V.P.,

00:59.100 --> 01:02.220
Because I already have you down,plus two--jasper and casper.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.910
Because no matter what we may think of each other deep down,

01:05.810 --> 01:08.990
and no matter how agonizing this scenario is for the both of us,

01:09.000 --> 01:14.510
***quietly endure.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.550
Thank you for your time,christine.

01:18.100 --> 01:19.950
See you on saturday.

eddie,it's me.

01:35.590 --> 01:36.690
Where are you?

01:36.700 --> 01:38.260
I tried you,like,six times.

01:38.670 --> 01:40.160
We need to talk.

01:40.170 --> 01:41.690
All me.

01:44.950 --> 01:47.300
I don't know about you,but I am spent.

01:48.030 --> 01:50.030
It's not like either of us got much sleep last night.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.580
Stop it,rooster.

01:51.590 --> 01:55.310
Tired though I may be,I feel invigorated,

01:55.810 --> 01:58.950
a happy stupor,bleary-eyed and wobbly boned,

01:58.960 --> 02:03.450
but energized to stumble into the great tomorrow with my new lady love.

02:04.060 --> 02:05.910
you slept with another guy's girlfriend.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.760
That's not something either of us should be gloating about.

02:07.990 --> 02:11.110
Mae that should factor somewhere into your stupid stupor.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.800
Copy that.Understandable.

02:13.810 --> 02:15.300
We'll move right past it.

02:19.560 --> 02:20.630
hello.

02:20.960 --> 02:22.610
Hi,nick.

02:23.990 --> 02:25.520
What?

02:33.450 --> 02:35.160
janet's on her way.

02:35.170 --> 02:36.390
thanks,buY.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.020
Eddie said that ikey's the one that brought him to the hospital,

02:39.030 --> 02:40.560
showed up right after the beat-down.

02:40.570 --> 02:41.530
He had to know it was coming.

02:41.540 --> 02:43.110
Hey,maybe he was trying to stop it.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.300
I'll tell you one thing.

02:44.310 --> 02:47.190
Ray taldo has officially stepped into the wtang.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.000
We don't know th ray had anything to do with this.

02:49.010 --> 02:50.860
Matt lauche is his boy.

02:50.870 --> 02:53.550
There's no way you're gonna deny me unleashing the wu-tang.

02:53.560 --> 02:54.790
No way.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.400
I get to call the play on this one,owen.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.990
I'm calling a stand-down.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.860
And we got all the time in the world for retribution.

03:40.530 --> 03:41.700
how is he?

03:41.710 --> 03:44.620
Well,his spirits are tter than his jawbone,so.

03:45.370 --> 03:46.360
there's that.

03:46.370 --> 03:47.680
Happy up,people.

03:47.690 --> 03:52.330
"Freddy venetta was carved out of greek marble with inexpensive scotc flowing through his veins.

03:52.340 --> 03:54.060
Stratton,you gotta stop quoting the book.

03:54.070 --> 03:56.020
I'm just saying he'll get good quick.

03:56.030 --> 03:56.680
I'm just saying,it's--

03:56.690 --> 03:59.050
hey,did you tell eddie?

04:00.950 --> 04:02.280
It wasn't the right time.

04:02.290 --> 04:03.710
Really?

04:04.040 --> 04:05.390
When is the right time?

04:05.400 --> 04:09.350
When is the precise moment that you let your best friend business partner know that

04:09.360 --> 04:14.090
you're fixing to bail on everything and everyone you finally got good with again?

04:14.100 --> 04:15.070
Aubrey.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.690
When is the right time?

04:19.660 --> 04:22.029
You should really,really have an answer,nick,

04:22.040 --> 04:24.360
because you're still gonna have to tell your family that

04:24.660 --> 04:28.080
you're not gonna be around while your dad is trying to beat cancer.

04:28.090 --> 04:31.180
I'll only be gone for five months,okay?

04:31.480 --> 04:32.510
I'll be back.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.510
You know the thing about those five months?

04:34.750 --> 04:36.960
They will be the worst five months ever.

04:36.970 --> 04:39.510
They will be for your dad,they will be for eddie,

04:39.520 --> 04:42.330
they will be for all of us who re naive enough to believe that

04:43.130 --> 04:45.610
you were finally starting to find your soul.

05:16.710 --> 05:18.250
Are you in pain?

05:18.570 --> 05:22.530
So long as my,uh,bone,skin and muscles don't count,

05:22.540 --> 05:24.750
I--my hair and nails never felt better.

05:31.740 --> 05:33.710
there's somethin' I need to tell ya.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.980
There's,um,something I need to tell you,too.

05:35.990 --> 05:37.270
I-I get to go first,okay?

05:37.280 --> 05:40.940
'Cause I've been laying here,trying to build up the courage.

05:40.950 --> 05:42.390
- Eddie,maybe we should just w
- no,wait.Wait,wait.

05:42.500 --> 05:47.030
An old friend of mine came back into town-- an old girlfriend,actually.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.390
Rory dunlop-- do you--you remember her?

05:50.990 --> 05:52.910
I should have told you from gate,

05:53.260 --> 05:55.580
but it just started stirring up all this stuff for me,

05:55.590 --> 05:59.180
and--and I just-- I didn't want it to get in the way of what we got going on here.

06:02.500 --> 06:09.570
and last night,in a moment of just supreme stupidity,we kissed.

06:09.940 --> 06:11.920
You kissed her and.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.280
and that was it.

06:15.290 --> 06:16.900
It wasn't even really a good kiss,

06:16.910 --> 06:19.470
'cause the moment that our lips touched,

06:19.480 --> 06:22.780
I-I-I realized that this wasn't the girl that I wanted to be ssing,

06:22.790 --> 06:24.640
and--and I stopped it.

06:24.650 --> 06:25.830
Wait.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.420
You--you stopped cause of me?

06:27.430 --> 06:29.360
Look,I know it's not much consolation,

06:29.370 --> 06:32.030
and--and you got every right to be creased,but just.

06:37.530 --> 06:39.550
you're telling me the truth.

06:46.110 --> 06:47.430
I have to go.

06:51.420 --> 06:55.760
she's not creased,not creased a bit.

06:55.770 --> 06:57.270
Perfect.

07:09.570 --> 07:11.070
What up,guys?

07:14.720 --> 07:16.730
so,uh,I got some good news.

07:17.420 --> 07:19.160
That job--I decided.

07:20.650 --> 07:22.270
I'm gonna take it.

07:24.130 --> 07:27.910
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,and I'll only be gone for five months,

07:27.920 --> 07:30.710
so I'll-I'll be back,you know,if,uh.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.230
wait.You're leaving?

07:33.610 --> 07:34.970
Just for five months.

07:34.980 --> 07:36.580
Now?

07:37.580 --> 07:39.520
Yeah,they need me by monday.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.340
Well,that's a twist.or not.

07:42.350 --> 07:42.910
Ronnie.

07:42.920 --> 07:43.980
What? I don't understand.You--

07:43.990 --> 07:46.710
look,dad,I'm onlgonna be a phone call away,okay?

07:46.720 --> 07:48.900
So if you need anything,I'll just buy a ticket,and--

07:51.310 --> 07:53.110
You're doing the right thing.

07:58.830 --> 08:00.160
I am?

08:00.170 --> 08:02.340
'Cause I-I wasn't sure.

08:02.350 --> 08:04.090
absolutely.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.190
There's nothing like-- be better to lift my spirits than.

08:11.940 --> 08:15.010
knowing my eldest is out there living his dream.

08:16.660 --> 08:19.970
storming eden in the garrett nameright,leslie?

08:20.640 --> 08:22.740
Yeah,that's right,robert.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.810
You re about this?

08:33.450 --> 08:35.640
Go,son.Create some memories.

08:35.990 --> 08:39.140
Drink those irishmen to the snot,okay?

08:39.150 --> 08:40.419
Yeah.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.059
Everything goes out back.

08:44.070 --> 08:46.440
If you go outside,you'll see.

08:48.060 --> 08:50.130
if this is what it takes to do an eagement party,

08:50.590 --> 08:53.080
I will give you anything to plan my wedding.

08:53.090 --> 08:54.620
I will give you sam.

08:58.480 --> 08:59.910
how did this happen?

09:00.250 --> 09:02.020
It was a misunderstanding.

09:02.310 --> 09:04.550
Eddie lied to you about his ex coming to town,

09:04.560 --> 09:05.930
and you misunderstood.

09:05.940 --> 09:07.370
Lay it out like that.

09:08.330 --> 09:12.350
But you should see him,all bruised and weak in that hospital bed.

09:18.740 --> 09:20.260
that was a stupid thing to do.

09:21.690 --> 09:23.220
You wanted to see me,ray?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.520
I did.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.250
I heard you took latekka to the hospital.

09:28.180 --> 09:29.500
What,you went there to stop it?

09:29.510 --> 09:30.370
That's right.

09:30.380 --> 09:32.000
Yeah,well,I love you for that.

09:32.830 --> 09:34.180
Truly,I do.

09:34.190 --> 09:37.410
No matter what kind of beef we have with eddie latekka,we don't draw fists.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.680
It's--it's beneath us.

09:42.620 --> 09:45.070
You'll find three weeks of matt's salary in your next paycheck.

09:45.350 --> 09:46.630
What?

09:46.640 --> 09:47.600
No.Come on,ray.

09:47.610 --> 09:48.770
That's all wrong,man.

09:48.780 --> 09:51.310
Hey,you don't gotta do that,ray.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.720
Yeah,of course I do.

09:53.100 --> 09:56.360
See,matty's a hockey player,forgets he's not wearing his skates on the reg.

09:57.900 --> 10:02.150
Besides,you deserve to be rewarded for spreading the name of cataldo builders in such a positive light--

10:02.870 --> 10:05.790
something I'm sure you'll continue to do in the future.

10:11.930 --> 10:13.380
Thank yoid dav.

10:22.420 --> 10:23.610
why you always wanna walk?

10:23.620 --> 10:25.070
Why you always wanna take a limo?

10:25.350 --> 10:26.640
It's 'cae I can.

10:26.650 --> 10:27.650
You know what I need?

10:27.660 --> 10:28.970
I need a beverage.

10:30.490 --> 10:31.890
Hannah anna.

10:33.140 --> 10:36.820
How's knights ridge's hottest jailbird doing on day like today?

10:37.280 --> 10:38.420
Pretty good.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.700
I heard about your dad.

10:41.980 --> 10:43.360
How is he?

10:43.370 --> 10:44.620
He's good.

10:45.310 --> 10:47.300
Yeah,I mean,if there's anyone who can lick it,

10:47.720 --> 10:48.900
it's the commander,right?

10:48.910 --> 10:51.720
Once that cancer gets a good look around at all those grumpy bones,

10:51.730 --> 10:52.780
it'll be like,"peace out,yo.

10:52.790 --> 10:55.110
This ain't no place to raise no family.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.490
" You all have a chat.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.930
I'm gonna go over there and,uh,check out that park bench.

11:01.290 --> 11:03.260
I collect park benches,hannah anna.

11:06.300 --> 11:07.730
Sorry.

11:09.560 --> 11:14.290
Look,if you need anything,um,anything at all,just.

11:17.540 --> 11:19.740
Will you tell your dad that our prayers are with him?

11:20.210 --> 11:21.710
I will.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.760
Are you gonna be around on saturday?

11:24.710 --> 11:26.280
Yeah,I think so.Why?

11:26.290 --> 11:29.770
There's an engagement party for me and ray at the house.

11:29.780 --> 11:31.800
We would love to have you.

11:31.810 --> 11:32.850
That won't be weird.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.810
Ray's borderline psychotic ex-wife is invited.

11:34.820 --> 11:38.370
Oh,so why not just invite your borderline psychotic ex-boyfriend?

11:38.380 --> 11:40.030
Yeah,something like that.

11:40.660 --> 11:42.330
And maybe your dad will want to come out.

11:42.340 --> 11:43.710
You should ask him.

11:43.720 --> 11:47.420
Ronnie,aubrey,the guys--

11:47.430 --> 11:49.510
it's a--it's a come one,come all thing.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.740
I'll think about it.

11:52.750 --> 11:53.720
Think about it.

12:01.070 --> 12:02.230
You know what I'm thinking?

12:02.830 --> 12:04.040
What's that?

12:04.850 --> 12:08.340
That maybe this is why you came back to the ridge.

12:08.660 --> 12:10.000
without even knowing it.

12:10.360 --> 12:11.960
Hannah,I came.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.360
oh I came back to teach a class.

12:21.810 --> 12:23.210
Maybe.

12:23.510 --> 12:27.300
Or maybe the universe brought you back so that you could be here,

12:27.310 --> 12:30.540
in this moment,with your dad,to help him heal.

12:32.700 --> 12:36.620
Maybe you had to go away then so that you could be here now.

12:40.530 --> 12:41.910
Maybe.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.000
I'll see you,nick.

12:54.850 --> 12:56.610
surprise visitors.

12:59.630 --> 13:02.640
I love it that I have friends who are robots.

13:02.650 --> 13:04.600
We come to wish you well.

13:05.310 --> 13:06.670
"We"?

13:06.680 --> 13:08.220
That's right.

13:09.590 --> 13:10.950
Greetings,buddy.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.160
How you holding up?

13:12.170 --> 13:13.340
There was no keeping me away.

13:13.350 --> 13:15.180
You are one resourceful shut-in.

13:15.190 --> 13:16.540
Yes,he is.

13:16.550 --> 13:17.480
Are you okay?

13:17.490 --> 13:19.120
Well,I'm hanging in there.

13:22.570 --> 13:24.650
let me bring you up to speed on things here at home.

13:24.660 --> 13:26.290
Yeah,the toaster's on the fritz.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.510
Blackened bagels abound.

13:28.930 --> 13:31.900
And there's brown water coming out of the upstairs ll bathroom.

13:31.910 --> 13:34.810
Oh,and a program note-- marisa tomei's on leno tonight.

13:34.820 --> 13:38.790
And we all know how you burn for her,so you probably want to tune in.

13:40.740 --> 13:44.460
News from home-- isn't it a comfort?

13:54.280 --> 13:55.830
Can we go see eddie?

13:56.290 --> 13:57.490
What,baby?

13:57.500 --> 13:59.120
I want to go see eddie.

14:00.570 --> 14:02.100
Well,that's really sweet of you to want to do,

14:02.110 --> 14:04.990
but I don't think eddie would want you to see him in the state that he's in.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.530
So why don't you let him heal up,and then we'll see him after?

14:09.480 --> 14:11.840
Did big cat know what matt was gonna do?

14:12.640 --> 14:14.240
Well,you know ray.What do you think?

14:14.250 --> 14:15.630
I think he hates eddie.

14:15.640 --> 14:16.630
He doesn't hate eddie.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.030
They're just not friends.

14:19.110 --> 14:22.500
And,sam,ray would never allow somebody to get hurt without stepping in.

14:25.650 --> 14:27.340
Why don't you go clean your room?

14:27.350 --> 14:29.530
Because we got a party to throw.

14:41.740 --> 14:43.860
Are you gonna let him get away with this?

14:45.950 --> 14:46.940
all right,what happened?

14:46.950 --> 14:50.190
What happened is your son decided to leave.

14:50.200 --> 14:53.460
He found out his father was sick,and he's gonna cut and run.

14:53.470 --> 14:55.130
Well,what's he gonna do here?

14:55.140 --> 14:57.840
Watch his old man puke in the john and eat soup?

14:58.900 --> 15:03.550
You know,how you manage to hide behind your pride every time someone's about to break your heart,

15:03.560 --> 15:05.990
robert,is something to behold.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.630
Stand up for yourself,for crying out loud.

15:08.640 --> 15:09.700
Nick's a grown man.

15:09.710 --> 15:11.040
He can do what he wants to do.

15:11.050 --> 15:12.490
Yeah,and he's your son,

15:12.500 --> 15:15.660
and it's your job as his parent to let him know that you need him.

15:15.670 --> 15:21.460
I am not going to beg him to be somewhere or someone he doesn't want to be.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.840
How long you been sitting there?

15:45.310 --> 15:46.700
15,20 minutes.

15:46.710 --> 15:48.130
Didn't wanna wake ya.

15:48.140 --> 15:51.100
Watching another man sleep,ikey,that'S.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.340
that's a bit weird.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.290
Nah.It's,h,it's what they do in the westerns.

15:56.300 --> 15:57.930
When the gunslinger's been shot,

15:58.420 --> 16:01.790
the drunken sidekick stays by his side in case the bad guys return.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.920
And there he remains until the gunslinger's healed.

16:06.250 --> 16:07.370
Right.

16:07.780 --> 16:11.410
Only you've lost your sidekick privileges as of late,huh?

16:13.090 --> 16:14.590
I brought you somethin'.

16:20.020 --> 16:23.290
Scotch and water with a pop of pepper sauce.

16:24.130 --> 16:25.370
Old school.

16:25.380 --> 16:28.120
That might not gtoo well with the painkillers,gabby.

16:28.580 --> 16:29.800
Yeah,good catch.

16:29.810 --> 16:31.820
Well,since I went to all the trouble of making it.

16:38.590 --> 16:40.910
I tried to stop it,you know.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.790
Yeah,I got your messages.

16:45.190 --> 16:47.770
One clobber in too late,but.

16:47.780 --> 16:49.520
I got 'em.

16:58.930 --> 17:00.920
Sit down,goofus.

17:10.720 --> 17:11.890
Sit.

17:12.270 --> 17:14.000
Drink.

17:14.010 --> 17:15.690
Don't talk.

17:16.270 --> 17:17.680
Just.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.390
just stay.

17:38.730 --> 17:40.470
How are you holding up?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.980
Well,the internet's not helping.

17:43.420 --> 17:48.430
The more I learn aboumy dad's cancer,the more my head wants to explode.

17:48.440 --> 17:51.920
I always say,if information is power,

17:52.850 --> 17:55.430
I'd prefer the weak bliss of ignorance.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.610
But that's just me.

18:00.450 --> 18:02.410
I wish I didn't know anything.

18:02.420 --> 18:07.140
I mean,I don't-- I don't know many things,but the things I do know.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.220
I hate 'em.

18:09.510 --> 18:11.650
Nick told youhe was leavin

18:15.060 --> 18:16.760
Wish I didn't know that.

18:16.990 --> 18:22.820
And I wish I didn't know that my dad was sick and that eddie got clobbered.

18:23.600 --> 18:28.110
I wish I didn't know that on this night,murph closes his sub shop early,

18:28.120 --> 18:31.640
so I can't get the one thing that always makes me feel better--

18:31.880 --> 18:39.350
you know,roast ef on pumpernickel with chipotle mayo and black olives,dash of salt.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.740
Wanna know what I wish?

18:43.410 --> 18:44.080
What?

18:44.090 --> 18:48.700
I wish you could remember what it was like before you knew all these things.

18:48.940 --> 18:50.350
Les call it.

18:51.070 --> 18:53.710
back wn you were.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.160
happy?

18:58.100 --> 18:59.840
Exactly.

19:00.280 --> 19:06.490
Now I can't account for your dad,bono or roast beef,but.

19:08.000 --> 19:14.550
I don't see why that happiness can't find its way back to you very,very soon.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.110
I'll see you later.

19:35.210 --> 19:37.020
Hey,what do you think of this bouquet?

19:39.390 --> 19:40.700
I think.

19:40.710 --> 19:42.810
it reminds me of eddie's bside,

19:44.460 --> 19:47.110
which is something I don't care to think about.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.740
You still haven't come clean?

19:49.750 --> 19:50.880
I'll talk to him.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.570
I will,soon.

19:53.700 --> 19:56.090
Do we have any more lilies to accent?

20:17.250 --> 20:18.300
Still alive?

20:18.310 --> 20:19.820
Jeez,enough already.

20:19.830 --> 20:21.640
Don't you have a business to run?

20:21.650 --> 20:24.750
Hey,I closed out the invoices on the parker account,thank you very much.

20:26.330 --> 20:30.010
It's,uh,it's kinda what I wanted to talk to you about.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.250
Well,I don't like that look.

20:35.370 --> 20:40.500
look,man,I,uh,I gotta leave town for ahile,just a couple months.

20:40.510 --> 20:42.090
I got a job opportunity.

20:42.100 --> 20:47.540
U2 wants me to go with them on tour,write a thing.

20:47.550 --> 20:48.540
U2?

20:48.550 --> 20:50.250
Yeah,but this won't be like the last time.

20:50.260 --> 20:51.080
I mean that.

20:51.090 --> 20:53.940
I'm just gonna go,collect the cash and come back.

20:53.950 --> 20:55.610
What about the shop?

20:56.410 --> 20:57.530
Well,it's up to you.

20:57.540 --> 21:00.760
I mean,I was kinda hoping that you'd keep it goin'.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.320
We're in a pretty solid place now.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.930
Ronnie's catching on quick.

21:04.940 --> 21:06.560
And the commander?

21:09.050 --> 21:10.800
I wish things were different,but.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.260
it is what it is.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.320
That it is.

21:22.370 --> 21:24.080
u2,huh?

21:25.110 --> 21:26.940
U2.

21:28.030 --> 21:30.440
God,can I come with?

21:30.890 --> 21:32.500
I'll ask bono.

21:36.890 --> 21:38.800
Touring with u2,huh?

21:39.270 --> 21:42.190
I mean,I hate music,but even i like u2.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.540
You hate music?

21:43.550 --> 21:44.610
Who hates music?

21:44.620 --> 21:46.360
I'm just saying,that is.

21:47.520 --> 21:50.920
touring with u2,that--that-- it's like a dream.

21:50.930 --> 21:53.390
Hey,I'll be back.

22:00.730 --> 22:02.450
Parting gift?

22:03.610 --> 22:05.550
Ikey stepped up.

22:05.560 --> 22:08.010
He tried to warn me matt was coming.

22:08.020 --> 22:09.800
Just thought owen should know.

22:09.810 --> 22:11.750
Did ikey say whether ray knew?

22:12.420 --> 22:14.240
He wasn't sure.

22:15.020 --> 22:15.930
Don't worry about it,man.

22:15.940 --> 22:17.860
I can handle the big cat.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.640
did you know what they were gonna do to eddie?

22:36.650 --> 22:37.680
The hell's wrong with you,garrett?

22:37.690 --> 22:38.950
the only,thing,ray,

22:38.960 --> 22:44.570
the only thing stopping me from cracking at smug smirk off your face is hannah and sam.

22:44.580 --> 22:45.480
I wouldn't do that to them.

22:45.490 --> 22:46.730
Slow it downrambo.

22:49.420 --> 22:51.910
I'm leaving town for a while,ray,but I know.

22:52.430 --> 22:53.360
I know.

22:53.370 --> 22:57.050
I know the things you've done to hurt me and hurt the people that I care about,

22:57.060 --> 22:58.370
but believe this.

22:58.380 --> 23:04.620
I'll be back,and if I find out that you hurt any of these people in any way again,

23:05.000 --> 23:08.350
I'll bury you,kid,bury you gone.

23:08.360 --> 23:11.570
Now don't you think you're letting your imagination get ahead of you,paperback writer?

23:11.580 --> 23:14.560
'Cause,yeah,you are damn straight that I tried to sour your return to the ridge.

23:14.570 --> 23:15.870
You were coming after my woman.

23:15.880 --> 23:16.900
Your woman,huh?

23:16.910 --> 23:18.930
So tell me,who's the villain in that tale,hmm?

23:21.590 --> 23:23.700
And then we come to the latekka beat-down.

23:24.730 --> 23:27.280
Now you know how much I despise that clunk.

23:28.120 --> 23:32.730
So ask youelf,if there was a chance for me to get in on his pouncing,

23:33.330 --> 23:35.800
would anything have stopped me from taking that first punch?

23:36.250 --> 23:38.890
Would I have missed that for anything in the world?

23:39.730 --> 23:42.600
Now I may be many things that you don't like--

23:43.080 --> 23:48.550
the man who's engaged to the woman that you love being front and center on nicky's list of wrongs.

23:49.190 --> 23:53.500
But the one thing that I am not is complicad.

23:54.070 --> 23:55.250
D of story.

23:55.260 --> 23:56.250
It better be the end.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.770
Oh,it is.

24:00.620 --> 24:02.080
oh,and,garrett,

24:03.370 --> 24:05.420
you're still a skinny little turd,

24:05.430 --> 24:07.680
and even though you might wanna give me a pasting,

24:08.110 --> 24:10.540
that doesn't necessarily mean you could.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.680
hey,ikey.

24:23.690 --> 24:25.340
Hey,hannah.

24:25.930 --> 24:27.330
You gettin' excited?

24:27.800 --> 24:30.800
Um,yeah,I think-- I think it's gonna be fun.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.620
ikey,can I ask you a question about ray?

24:37.990 --> 24:39.290
Of course.

24:41.270 --> 24:42.170
Actually,forget it.

24:42.180 --> 24:43.900
I don't want tput you in any kind of position.

24:44.330 --> 24:48.150
Hannah,I know we ain't always been tight,but we go back almost 20 years,

24:48.160 --> 24:51.790
so you got somethin' you gotta get off your chest about anything,you get it off.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.930
Come here.

25:01.860 --> 25:05.080
Do you think that ray had anything to do with eddie getting jumped?

25:05.090 --> 25:06.920
Because if he did,then I don't know what

25:06.930 --> 25:09.160
no.He didn'T.

25:09.170 --> 25:10.280
How do you know?

25:10.290 --> 25:14.650
'Cause I walked into ray's office while he was chewin' out matt for gettin' after eddie.

25:14.660 --> 25:16.790
He docked him three weeks on his paycheck,

25:16.800 --> 25:19.500
gave it to me for taking eddie to the hospital,

25:19.510 --> 25:23.210
so by my own eyes and ears,straight up,

25:23.920 --> 25:26.030
you don't got nothin' to worry about.

25:30.390 --> 25:31.390
Thanks,ikey.

25:31.400 --> 25:32.830
Yeah,no problem.

25:36.590 --> 25:38.070
hey,lukey.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.430
Luke,come move this.

26:26.500 --> 26:27.990
everything all right?

26:30.680 --> 26:32.670
I need to tell you something.

26:33.140 --> 26:34.540
I knew it.

26:35.650 --> 26:38.120
You said you were okay with me and rory,

26:38.130 --> 26:40.420
but,oh,man,I knew there was more to come.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.090
All right.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.090
Fire away.

26:47.680 --> 26:50.910
Um,I'm new at this thing,eddie-- being in a relationship--

26:51.270 --> 26:53.630
and you've been really good at holding my hand along the way.

26:53.640 --> 26:54.400
Aw,come on.

26:54.650 --> 26:56.340
We've-- we've held each other's hands.

26:57.040 --> 27:00.630
I.in a way,I'm-- I'm new at it,too.

27:02.520 --> 27:05.010
the other night,I came to see you.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.630
I knew rory was in town and you weren't telling me,

27:08.640 --> 27:13.290
and I came to see you,but what I saw was you and her kissing.

27:14.790 --> 27:16.160
you saw us?

27:16.170 --> 27:17.540
I did.

27:17.830 --> 27:20.750
I didn't stick around long enough to see how it ended,

27:21.090 --> 27:25.800
but I saw,and I misunderstood.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.140
"Misunderstood." You--you thought--

27:28.150 --> 27:30.860
I thought that I was witnessing the beginning of something,

27:31.740 --> 27:33.610
and I was devastated.

27:33.620 --> 27:35.640
I felt like someone had pushed me off thledge of a--

27:35.650 --> 27:39.580
a super tall building,and I looked for something to grab onto,

27:40.830 --> 27:44.070
and I,uh,I did something terrible.

27:46.550 --> 27:48.620
What did you grab onto,janet?

27:50.280 --> 27:51.920
Rooster.

27:54.690 --> 27:56.370
You grabbed on.

27:56.380 --> 27:57.660
to rooster?

27:57.670 --> 27:59.310
I did.

28:00.370 --> 28:02.650
And by "grabbed on," you mean.

28:02.660 --> 28:04.560
I slept with him.

28:05.870 --> 28:07.820
With rooster russo?

28:07.830 --> 28:09.450
Yes.

28:09.690 --> 28:11.490
I care forou so much,eddie,

28:11.730 --> 28:15.670
and these past months have been the most magical time of my--my life,

28:16.240 --> 28:18.860
and--but no matter how wonderful you treat me--

28:18.870 --> 28:21.230
and you do.You do--

28:21.240 --> 28:27.310
I amnever gonna stop feeling like the chubby girl who gets rejected by the captain of the football team,

28:27.560 --> 28:31.070
and I needed something to hold on to the way you've made me feel,

28:31.080 --> 28:35.080
because I was so sure that I was losing that,that I was losing you.

28:37.600 --> 28:40.130
I am so sorry,eddie.

28:51.760 --> 28:55.600
you know the funny thing about being laid up like this?

28:57.020 --> 29:03.920
It has been a revolving door of people walking in here and pouring their hearts out.

29:03.930 --> 29:05.580
Itakes sense.

29:05.590 --> 29:07.550
I'm in a weakened state.

29:07.830 --> 29:11.420
I guess the rgiveness has been flowing.

29:14.940 --> 29:17.160
but what you just told me,janet--

29:17.620 --> 29:22.910
that you would have sex with another man instead of asking me what goes on.

29:24.410 --> 29:26.320
hell,all I can say to that is.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.930
get the hell out of my sight.

29:31.940 --> 29:32.530
no,eddie--

29:32.540 --> 29:34.120
and go find somewhere to rot.

29:34.130 --> 29:34.850
please,just--

29:34.860 --> 29:38.310
because the captain of the footballeam,janet,is rejecting you.

29:39.550 --> 29:41.410
Get--g out of my room.

29:41.900 --> 29:43.530
Get.

29:44.070 --> 29:46.120
get out of my room!

30:19.500 --> 30:21.440
boys,say hi to the davises.

30:24.630 --> 30:27.720
ray,hannah,congratulations.

30:27.730 --> 30:29.510
I hope you both find happiness together.

30:29.520 --> 30:30.830
Thank you,christine.

30:30.840 --> 30:33.180
Well,you'll forgive me for not having my present on hand.

30:33.450 --> 30:35.790
Colaint withdrawals are hard to gift wra

30:36.440 --> 30:37.950
what's gotten into you?

30:40.830 --> 30:42.500
Are the twins getting this?

30:44.290 --> 30:45.160
they are.

30:45.170 --> 30:46.290
Good.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.240
I still hate you both like chlamydia,

30:48.250 --> 30:52.410
which I'm quite sure one of you knows a thing or two about and can only hope the other one doesn'T.

30:52.420 --> 30:53.970
yet.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.750
what was that about?

30:59.760 --> 31:02.300
Let's just call it a new chapter.

31:02.310 --> 31:03.780
Oh,here's to that.

31:04.910 --> 31:05.960
Right there.

31:05.970 --> 31:08.130
I never was part of your coffee klatch,

31:08.140 --> 31:10.950
owen,but we all lose our footing,don't we?

31:11.740 --> 31:15.570
It's how you step up in a grungle by which you should be judged,

31:15.580 --> 31:20.430
and word on the spit is,ikey stepped up for team latekka.

31:22.050 --> 31:23.510
See you later.

31:24.820 --> 31:26.460
That is the word,rooster.

31:28.210 --> 31:29.910
Th is the word.

31:32.480 --> 31:33.980
hi,mr.Garrett.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.420
I'm so happy you came.

31:36.430 --> 31:37.640
Well,happy to be here,hannah.

31:37.650 --> 31:40.190
You met the dean,uh,obviously.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.850
Yes,whe uh,when sam was in the hospital.

31:41.860 --> 31:42.660
Right.

31:42.670 --> 31:43.710
Congratulations,hannah.

31:43.720 --> 31:44.900
Thank you.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.080
How's,uh,how's this guy doing?

31:47.090 --> 31:50.850
Ah,he's a stubborn old mule,but he'll outlive all of us.

31:50.860 --> 31:52.120
Here,re,here.

31:52.720 --> 31:54.160
Is nick coming?

31:55.550 --> 31:57.170
Nick's gone,hannah.

31:58.190 --> 31:59.550
He's gone--gone where?

31:59.560 --> 32:01.800
Well,he--he left.

32:01.810 --> 32:03.000
He--he just went away.

32:03.010 --> 32:04.010
He did not.

32:04.020 --> 32:05.020
He did.

32:05.030 --> 32:06.190
He took a job.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.740
He's,uh,leaving town right now as we speak.

32:08.750 --> 32:09.950
No,he wouldn't do that.

32:09.960 --> 32:10.770
It's true.

32:10.780 --> 32:12.230
I mean,it's--it's okay.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.390
No.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.360
You're wrong.

32:15.820 --> 32:17.320
I don't think so.

32:17.700 --> 32:19.670
Sometimes it takes him ten years.

32:20.740 --> 32:26.050
or ten hours or ten minutes,but nick always does the right thing.

32:26.630 --> 32:30.150
I mean,he always did,and he always will.

32:32.160 --> 32:34.270
You just have to have a little faith.

33:32.100 --> 33:34.070
there was no chipotle mayo,

33:34.330 --> 33:37.410
so I threw a pepperoncini on there for a kick in the pants.

33:37.980 --> 33:40.030
You made me my happy sandwich?

33:40.040 --> 33:42.910
Hopefully it is up to your discriminating standards.

33:44.310 --> 33:46.230
You de my happy sandwich.

33:49.430 --> 33:50.160
ronnie?

33:50.170 --> 33:51.520
I'm in love with you,aubrey.

33:51.530 --> 33:55.810
I've been in love with you ever since nick brought you home on taco tuesday on that wednesday,

33:56.040 --> 33:58.670
and I-I know it's weird,because he's my brother,

33:58.680 --> 34:00.210
and-d--and you guys are dating,

34:00.220 --> 34:02.740
but,uh,since he's leaving,I have to tell you that.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.230
I love that when you talk,you--you flap your hands,

34:06.240 --> 34:09.659
or sometimes you use big words that make no sense to me,

34:09.670 --> 34:15.409
and I love that no matter what room you'rin,the light attaches itself to you,

34:16.949 --> 34:22.219
and most of all,I love the way that I feel when I'm near you.

34:35.010 --> 34:36.530
oh,boy.

34:42.110 --> 34:43.480
I'm staying,dad.

34:43.850 --> 34:46.050
- Nick?
- No,it's done.

34:46.469 --> 34:47.870
I want to be here.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.750
Aw,this better not be on account of me

34:49.760 --> 34:53.420
no,it's-- it's on account of.

34:54.610 --> 34:56.420
I mean,this is where I want to be--

34:56.790 --> 34:58.470
with you guys,

34:58.790 --> 35:01.940
and look,dad,you're gonna be fine,all right?

35:01.950 --> 35:04.410
I know it,okay?

35:05.640 --> 35:08.440
It's just--it's where I'm meant to be right now,

35:09.780 --> 35:12.100
and I'll--I-I'm sorry if I lost that--

35:12.110 --> 35:13.720
sight of that for--

35:17.550 --> 35:19.320
we're gonna lick this thing,kiddo.

35:19.330 --> 35:20.160
I know.

35:20.170 --> 35:21.450
We're gonna lick it.

35:39.830 --> 35:41.270
Did you talk to eddie?

35:41.280 --> 35:42.980
Yeah,we talked.

35:44.850 --> 35:46.630
Is every--everything cool?

35:47.180 --> 35:48.420
Everything's great.

35:48.430 --> 35:49.830
Good.

35:50.360 --> 35:51.290
Congrats,hannah.

35:51.300 --> 35:52.880
Thanks.

35:55.490 --> 35:56.970
Perfect timing.

36:07.310 --> 36:08.930
I'm stickin' around.

36:09.890 --> 36:11.790
I have to apologize to both of you.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.100
You know,I'm just-- I'm an idiot most of the time.

36:14.110 --> 36:15.480
I'm sorry.It's just.

36:21.110 --> 36:22.920
I have this thing I have to attend to,

36:23.830 --> 36:25.210
but I'll catch you guys later?

36:28.800 --> 36:30.370
I love you,bro.

36:40.790 --> 36:42.440
let's take a drive,ikey.

36:46.420 --> 36:48.720
I didn't have nothin' to do with eddie getting beat up.

36:48.730 --> 36:50.580
Yeah,we know all about you and eddie.

36:51.340 --> 36:52.370
So let's take a drive.

36:52.380 --> 36:53.730
Where to?

36:58.390 --> 37:01.030
It's 3:00 on saturday,moosh.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.550
Where you think we're goin'?

37:03.080 --> 37:04.180
Come on.

37:04.190 --> 37:05.470
Yeah?

37:36.520 --> 37:38.200
I heard you weren't feeling well,

37:38.720 --> 37:40.070
so I got you this.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.420
thanks,sam.

37:41.430 --> 37:43.090
'Cause I think you're a cowboy.

38:05.790 --> 38:10.130
so about what I said earlier,I was emotional.

38:10.140 --> 38:13.140
I mean,my dad's sick,and ray's marrying hannah,

38:13.150 --> 38:14.900
and eddie's beat up in the hospital.

38:14.910 --> 38:16.150
There's no more harry potter books.

38:16.160 --> 38:18.850
I mean,there's just a lot going on that I--

38:46.700 --> 38:48.240
dorks.

38:58.620 --> 38:59.920
Matt's ere.

39:02.710 --> 39:04.220
I'll handle this,okay?

39:07.570 --> 39:08.800
You gottgo.

39:09.190 --> 39:10.450
What are you talking about?

39:10.460 --> 39:12.250
Well,we gotta keep up appearances.

39:12.720 --> 39:14.060
Spirit of marital bliss.

39:14.070 --> 39:16.630
All right,but you owe me.

39:17.140 --> 39:18.140
You know,latekka--

39:18.150 --> 39:19.670
if he decides to press charges,

39:19.680 --> 39:21.450
I could get all kinds of jacked up.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.290
Well,just put it on my bill,slick.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.430
knights ridge,baby!

39:50.440 --> 39:52.360
Ain't that america?
