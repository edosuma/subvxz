00:02.500 --> 00:04.917
[dramatic music]

00:14.125 --> 00:16.917
- Good morning, ambassador.
- Captain.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.542
I didn't know
you read "Universe Today."

00:19.625 --> 00:23.750
Ah, after our last encounter
with your reporters

00:23.833 --> 00:26.750
I felt that I should be
more prepared in the future.

00:26.833 --> 00:29.542
I find this notion
of the press..

00:29.625 --> 00:32.583
...a fascinating, but
sometimes troubling concept.

00:32.667 --> 00:34.583
[Sheridan chuckles]
'Join the club.'

00:34.667 --> 00:36.208

00:37.875 --> 00:41.083
'Please insert issue

00:41.167 --> 00:44.375
Back home, if there is
something you need to know

00:44.458 --> 00:47.125
you are told just what
you require and no more.

00:47.208 --> 00:48.792
It is tradition.

00:48.875 --> 00:51.083
[automated message]
'Express preferences.'

00:51.167 --> 00:52.625
Standard preferences.

00:52.708 --> 00:54.583
Oh, and include more
detailed information

00:54.667 --> 00:56.292
on the sixth game
of the World Series.

00:56.375 --> 00:57.792

01:06.917 --> 01:08.292
Ah.

01:08.375 --> 01:09.875

01:22.042 --> 01:23.083
Yes.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.000
You know, uh,
while this incessant curiosity

01:27.083 --> 01:29.000
may seem necessary to you

01:29.083 --> 01:30.958
Minbari respect
the privacy of others

01:31.042 --> 01:33.333
by not prying
into their affairs.

01:33.417 --> 01:35.792
To express undue curiosity..

01:35.875 --> 01:39.375
[automated message]
'Unable to insert
Eye On Minbari section.'

01:39.458 --> 01:42.333
'Do you wish
to accept edition anyway?'

01:43.417 --> 01:45.167
Uh, yes.

01:45.250 --> 01:46.667
Yes, I do.

01:46.750 --> 01:48.708
Eye On Minbari?

01:48.792 --> 01:50.333
It is good to know
what your people

01:50.417 --> 01:52.167
are thinking and saying
about my people.

01:52.250 --> 01:53.708
Oh, yeah.

01:53.792 --> 01:55.667
And, uh..

01:55.750 --> 01:58.167
I often learn things
about my own world

01:58.250 --> 02:02.083
before I'm told what
I need to know and no more.

02:15.792 --> 02:17.667
[breathes heavily]

02:23.875 --> 02:25.583
[grunts]

02:28.042 --> 02:29.542
Derek.

02:29.625 --> 02:31.542
- 'Is that you?'
- Yeah. Lee?

02:33.292 --> 02:36.167
I made it.
I told you I would.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.125
[panting]
I did it, Derek.

02:38.208 --> 02:39.625
I got the info.

02:39.708 --> 02:41.292
We've gotta get you
to the hospital.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.375
No. There's no time.

02:43.458 --> 02:45.375
It's all here.

02:45.458 --> 02:47.542
Get it to them, Derek.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.250
Get it to, to Babylon 5.

02:51.333 --> 02:53.042
Tell them..

02:53.125 --> 02:54.250
[groans]

02:54.333 --> 02:55.917
Tell them it's not safe.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.750
There's danger within.

02:59.333 --> 03:00.750
Tell them..

03:03.208 --> 03:05.000
[groans]

03:07.708 --> 03:09.583
(male #1)
'You men, go up ahead.
You two, over that way.'

03:09.667 --> 03:11.500
(male #2)
'Okay, I don't see him here.'

03:14.708 --> 03:17.500
(Sheridan)
The Babylon project
was our last

03:17.583 --> 03:20.167
best hope for peace.

03:20.250 --> 03:23.042
A self-contained world
five miles long

03:23.125 --> 03:25.458
located in neutral territory.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.958
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

03:31.042 --> 03:33.875
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

03:34.792 --> 03:37.875
A shining beacon in space

03:37.958 --> 03:40.000
all alone in the night.

03:40.083 --> 03:43.458
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

03:43.542 --> 03:46.792
the year the Great War
came upon us all.

03:47.958 --> 03:49.250
This is the story

03:49.333 --> 03:51.792
of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:51.875 --> 03:54.083
The year is 2259.

03:54.167 --> 03:57.083
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:57.167 --> 04:00.208
[theme music]

04:30.208 --> 04:33.250
[music continues]

04:51.750 --> 04:53.708
Good morning, Mr. Garibaldi.

04:53.792 --> 04:55.208
Captain. Sleep well?

04:55.292 --> 04:57.042
(Sheridan)
'Yes, thank you.'

04:57.125 --> 04:58.750
'Actually, I got up
early this morning'

04:58.833 --> 05:01.375
'took a walk in the garden.'

05:01.458 --> 05:02.875
'You know what I miss?'

05:02.958 --> 05:06.375
'What I haven't seen
in almost four years?'

05:06.458 --> 05:08.583
- What's that?
- Trees.

05:08.667 --> 05:11.875
Well, we've got a whole bunch
of fruit trees in the orchard.

05:11.958 --> 05:14.083
No, no, it's not the same.

05:14.167 --> 05:17.875
I'm talking big, honking,
solid massive trees

05:17.958 --> 05:20.708
that have had their roots
deep in the earth for centuries.

05:20.792 --> 05:25.375
You know, uh,
redwoods, firs, pines.

05:26.625 --> 05:28.458
Trees, you know
what I'm talking about?

05:28.542 --> 05:30.542
- I miss them.
- Uh-huh.

05:32.292 --> 05:33.875
[sighs]
All clear?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.375
Alright. So, what's up?

05:35.458 --> 05:36.792
I was wondering
if you gave anymore thought

05:36.875 --> 05:38.417
to what I mentioned last night?

05:38.500 --> 05:39.833
About Talia?

05:39.917 --> 05:41.583
She could be a great
resource for us.

05:41.667 --> 05:42.958
Exposing the coup back home

05:43.042 --> 05:44.750
means going up against
some pretty big guns

05:44.833 --> 05:47.625
and we're gonna need
all the help we can get.

05:48.875 --> 05:50.417
Maybe you're right.

05:50.500 --> 05:54.250
She was as upset about the death
of the president as anyone else.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.417
I can't see why
she wouldn't wanna help us.

05:56.500 --> 05:57.917
I'll set up a meeting
in a few days?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.500
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:05.667 --> 06:08.750
[indistinct chatter]

06:16.125 --> 06:17.958
It's hard to believe
it's taken us so long

06:18.042 --> 06:19.958
to get to this point,
two years.

06:20.042 --> 06:22.292
Well, you didn't
exactly make it easy.

06:22.375 --> 06:24.750
Me? How about you?

06:24.833 --> 06:26.167
I have, you know,
I've been nothing

06:26.250 --> 06:28.208
but compassionate
and understanding.

06:28.292 --> 06:29.833
I mean, all you had to do
was admit that you were wrong

06:29.917 --> 06:31.750
and I was right and
everything would've been fine.

06:31.833 --> 06:33.458
You are the most stubborn.

06:33.542 --> 06:34.833
[beeping]

06:34.917 --> 06:36.083
Ivanova here.

06:36.167 --> 06:38.667
You're needed up
in C and C, commander.

06:38.750 --> 06:41.292
A ship came in through
the jumpgate a few minutes ago.

06:42.250 --> 06:44.542
But now it's just sitting there.

06:44.625 --> 06:46.542
On my way. I'm sorry.

06:46.625 --> 06:48.542
That's alright.
I was finished anyway.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.583
I have to find some place
to stay tonight.

06:50.667 --> 06:51.625
So I better get to it.

06:51.708 --> 06:53.417
What's wrong with your quarters?

06:53.500 --> 06:55.917
There's some kind of a problem
with the air recycling system.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.458
I called around,
but practically everything

06:57.542 --> 06:59.083
on the station is booked up.

06:59.167 --> 07:01.208
I can try Brown sector--

07:01.292 --> 07:03.833
Um, no. Not a good idea.

07:03.917 --> 07:05.708
Look, um, if you want

07:05.792 --> 07:08.042
why don't you just come over
to my quarters tonight?

07:09.833 --> 07:12.375
- Oh, I couldn't.
- No, it's not a problem.

07:12.458 --> 07:14.625
- I'd like the company.
- Are you sure?

07:14.708 --> 07:17.792
- What'd I just say?
- Alright. Alright.

07:17.875 --> 07:20.458
- Thanks.
- I'll see you tonight.

07:20.542 --> 07:21.958
Okay.

07:29.833 --> 07:31.583
(Ivanova)
'Definite carbon scoring
on the hull.'

07:31.667 --> 07:33.667
'She's been hit by something.'

07:36.167 --> 07:38.083
Unidentified ship,
this is Babylon control.

07:38.167 --> 07:40.208
Please respond.

07:40.292 --> 07:42.375
- Anything?
- Negative.

07:42.458 --> 07:44.708
Still registering one life form.

07:44.792 --> 07:46.417
Alright, let's bring her in
and see what's inside.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.125
Better have a med team there.

07:49.208 --> 07:50.542
(Garibaldi)
'Hey, doc.'

07:51.958 --> 07:53.250
Any luck tracing the ship's ID?

07:53.333 --> 07:54.792
No, which leads me to think

07:54.875 --> 07:56.917
it's probably
a bogus serial number.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.167
- Have you reported it yet?
- No.

07:59.250 --> 08:01.292
Until I know a little bit
more about what's inside.

08:01.375 --> 08:03.708
Dr. Franklin,
confirm one passenger.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.958
She's unconscious,
injured, but alive.

08:06.042 --> 08:07.875
- 'Alright, bring her in.'
- Yes, sir.

08:07.958 --> 08:09.167
Dr. Franklin to Medlab One.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.292
Prepare to receive
one patient, human.

08:11.375 --> 08:12.958
Extent and cause
of injuries unknown.

08:13.042 --> 08:15.542
(female #1)
'Confirmed. Standing by.'

08:15.625 --> 08:17.083
You want me to call you
when she's awake?

08:17.167 --> 08:19.458
Yeah, sure. I'll let the captain
know the situation.

08:19.542 --> 08:22.042
As soon as I, uh..
W-wait a second, wait a second.

08:22.125 --> 08:23.167
Hold up.

08:24.208 --> 08:25.667
I know her.

08:25.750 --> 08:28.417
- 'It's, it's Lyta.'
- 'Who?'

08:28.500 --> 08:30.208
Lyta Alexander.

08:30.292 --> 08:31.792
She was the first
commercial telepath

08:31.875 --> 08:34.417
assigned to Babylon 5
a little over two years ago.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.667
'She arrived January 3, 2257.'

08:37.750 --> 08:39.375
'She left
about six weeks later.'

08:39.458 --> 08:42.083
Hmm, didn't last long.

08:42.167 --> 08:43.417
Was there a problem?

08:43.500 --> 08:45.292
Yeah. I suppose
you could say that.

08:45.375 --> 08:47.958
She arrived here the day before
Ambassador Kosh came aboard

08:48.042 --> 08:49.542
from the Vorlon Empire.

08:49.625 --> 08:50.958
Only somebody tried to kill him

08:51.042 --> 08:53.292
as soon as he stepped off
his ship.

08:53.375 --> 08:56.708
Lyta agreed to scan him
to try to save his life.

08:56.792 --> 08:58.917
She couldn't see what was
inside his encounter suit

08:59.000 --> 09:01.458
but she did manage
to get into Kosh's mind

09:01.542 --> 09:04.667
the only human who's ever
done it and survived.

09:05.292 --> 09:06.583
What'd she see?

09:06.667 --> 09:07.917
She thought she saw
Commander Sinclair

09:08.000 --> 09:09.375
trying to kill Kosh.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.292
Turns out it was somebody
using a changeling net

09:11.375 --> 09:12.750
to impersonate him.

09:12.833 --> 09:16.458
Still, the accusation
almost ruined his career.

09:16.542 --> 09:19.292
And you haven't heard
anything from her since.

09:19.375 --> 09:21.333
Oh, she and the doctor
who operated on Kosh

09:21.417 --> 09:23.542
were recalled to Earth
a few weeks later.

09:23.625 --> 09:25.833
'After the scan'

09:25.917 --> 09:28.125
she was never quite the same.

09:28.208 --> 09:30.833
It's hard to explain,
but from that day on..

09:32.042 --> 09:34.042
...she was never
quite right anymore.

09:39.167 --> 09:40.792
[Lyta gasping]

09:40.875 --> 09:42.667
[coughing]

09:44.333 --> 09:45.583
It's alright. You're safe.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.167
You're on Babylon 5.

09:47.250 --> 09:49.042
- Oh.
- Well, take it easy.

09:49.125 --> 09:50.625
You've been through a lot.

09:50.708 --> 09:53.083
Are you in any pain?
Is there anything you need?

09:56.458 --> 09:57.833
[whimpers]

09:57.917 --> 09:59.708
I can do it!

10:01.000 --> 10:02.208
I wanna see the captain.

10:02.292 --> 10:03.583
(Franklin)
'Yes. Well, all in good time.'

10:03.667 --> 10:05.208
- This can't wait!
- 'Yes, it can--'

10:05.292 --> 10:07.500
I wanna see
Captain Sheridan now!

10:07.583 --> 10:09.583
And the rest. I wanna see
everyone all together.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.375
I don't want to be alone
with any of you.

10:11.458 --> 10:13.042
- 'Why?'
- Just give him my message.

10:13.125 --> 10:16.375
Tell him that someone here,
one of you, is a traitor

10:16.458 --> 10:18.375
and I can prove it.

10:22.292 --> 10:24.708
(Lyta)
'What I'm about to tell you
cost two good men their lives.'

10:24.792 --> 10:26.708
'And nearly cost mine.'

10:26.792 --> 10:29.792
'But this place is important
to a lot of people.'

10:29.875 --> 10:32.500
'More important
than you could possibly know.'

10:34.208 --> 10:37.375
So I had to come back
to warn you.

10:37.458 --> 10:38.750
Warn us about what?

10:40.167 --> 10:43.417
I imagine Mr. Garibaldi has
already filled you in about me.

10:45.750 --> 10:47.542
Yeah, that you were stationed
here for a while

10:47.625 --> 10:49.833
a couple of years ago.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.375
That you scanned Ambassador Kosh

10:51.458 --> 10:53.958
and no one's heard from you
since you left.

10:54.042 --> 10:57.208
They wanted to know
what I saw in Kosh's mind.

10:57.292 --> 10:58.917
There wasn't anything more
than what I'd reported

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
but they didn't
wanna believe me.

11:01.083 --> 11:04.083
There was just the memory
of his attack

11:04.167 --> 11:05.583
and a feeling.

11:05.667 --> 11:08.125
What kind of feeling?

11:08.208 --> 11:10.542
It's not something
I can put into words.

11:10.625 --> 11:12.792
I've tried for two years
and I still can't do it.

11:14.917 --> 11:16.875
But they wouldn't accept that.

11:18.667 --> 11:20.917
Finally, six months ago

11:21.000 --> 11:24.750
I escaped the Psi Corps
on a shuttle bound for Mars.

11:24.833 --> 11:28.417
Since that time, I've been
trying to get into Vorlon space.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.750
Vorlons don't allow anyone
inside their borders.

11:30.833 --> 11:33.125
Those who try don't come back.

11:33.208 --> 11:34.708
I know.

11:38.875 --> 11:41.417
[sighs]
But ever since I touched
Ambassador Kosh

11:41.500 --> 11:44.292
I've been drawn there.

11:44.375 --> 11:47.250
Sooner or later,
I'm gonna make it.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.667
And they'll let me in.
I know it.

11:54.042 --> 11:58.125
While on Mars, I got involved
with the revolutionary movement.

11:58.208 --> 12:00.458
I had to pay my way
and someone's always willing

12:00.542 --> 12:02.500
to hire a good telepath.

12:03.542 --> 12:05.458
Seven days ago

12:05.542 --> 12:07.875
one of our best people
was murdered on his way back

12:07.958 --> 12:11.292
from an intelligence gathering
operation in Syria Planum.

12:11.375 --> 12:12.417
That's interesting.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.458
Psi Corps has
a research center there.

12:15.542 --> 12:19.667
Our agent found out about
a secret Psi Corps program.

12:19.750 --> 12:21.833
A sleeper program.

12:21.917 --> 12:23.708
They bring someone in
and work them over

12:23.792 --> 12:26.667
with drugs and deep scans

12:26.750 --> 12:29.667
to create a new personality

12:29.750 --> 12:31.833
a personality
suited to their needs.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.042
This personality
is then submerged

12:34.125 --> 12:37.417
so far into the subconscious
that it won't show up

12:37.500 --> 12:39.375
even on a deep scan.

12:39.458 --> 12:40.833
But it's always there.

12:40.917 --> 12:44.042
Watching, listening, spying

12:44.125 --> 12:47.333
until the day the password
is sent telepathically.

12:47.417 --> 12:48.667
It can't be just spoken.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.958
It has to be sent directly
into the brain.

12:51.042 --> 12:55.208
At that moment, the real
personality is destroyed

12:55.292 --> 12:58.292
and the implanted one
takes control permanently.

12:58.375 --> 13:02.375
So until then, someone could
be a spy and not even know it.

13:02.458 --> 13:03.708
Correct.

13:03.792 --> 13:05.333
They've apparently used
this technique

13:05.417 --> 13:07.583
to plant moles
in several government agencies

13:07.667 --> 13:10.167
including Babylon 5.

13:10.250 --> 13:12.375
[sighs]
We don't know
who's been infected

13:12.458 --> 13:16.875
but someone here is not
what he or she appears.

13:16.958 --> 13:19.125
Our guess is that it's someone
on the command staff

13:19.208 --> 13:21.250
or close to it
since the mole would be looking

13:21.333 --> 13:22.667
for vital information.

13:22.750 --> 13:25.708
All we have is a code name,
Control.

13:25.792 --> 13:26.875
I'm sorry. This is nuts.

13:26.958 --> 13:28.500
Do you really expect us
to believe you?

13:28.583 --> 13:31.667
I mean, how do we know you're
not just making all of this up?

13:31.750 --> 13:34.417
Because I have the password.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.375
Captain, I realize
you don't know me

13:36.458 --> 13:38.000
and you've got no reason
to trust me

13:38.083 --> 13:40.042
but I can prove what I've said.

13:40.125 --> 13:42.750
With your permission,
I can send a telepathic probe

13:42.833 --> 13:44.875
into the minds of your staff
one at a time.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.625
I won't scan, won't read

13:46.708 --> 13:49.125
won't do anything
to invade your privacy.

13:49.208 --> 13:51.292
I will just send the password

13:51.375 --> 13:53.167
and see what happens.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.667
My people will object, properly

13:55.750 --> 13:57.417
to having their loyalty
questioned.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.417
It's not a question of loyalty.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.417
Whoever it is doesn't know
they've been programmed.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.042
[sighs]
They won't know
I'm sending to them

14:05.125 --> 14:07.167
so you won't have to tell them.

14:07.250 --> 14:08.917
Just get me on a line of sight.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.125
I'll take care of the rest.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.250
Alright, we'll discuss it
and get back to you later.

14:16.333 --> 14:19.042
[sighs]
Don't take too long, captain.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.625
The implanted personality
is conditioned

14:20.708 --> 14:22.208
for self-preservation.

14:22.292 --> 14:24.583
It will react to anything
it perceives as a threat

14:24.667 --> 14:26.625
and as of right now, that is me.

14:26.708 --> 14:29.333
So until this is over,
with all due respect

14:29.417 --> 14:31.417
I don't want to be alone
with any of you.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.792
And you may wanna keep an eye on
each other while you're at it.

14:33.875 --> 14:35.250
Thanks for the thought.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.125
Now if you don't mind,
I'll have a security guard

14:37.208 --> 14:40.417
uh, no, two security guards
take you to a holding cell

14:40.500 --> 14:42.750
until we decide
what to do about this.

14:43.667 --> 14:44.792
Guards.

14:46.583 --> 14:48.292
- Yes, sir.
- Take her to holding.

14:48.375 --> 14:49.667
Yes, sir.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.000
This way, please.

14:56.750 --> 14:58.625
Comments, anyone?

14:58.708 --> 15:00.917
Does the phrase no way in hell
ring a bell?

15:03.708 --> 15:06.208
[indistinct chatter]

15:11.917 --> 15:13.042
Captain.

15:14.208 --> 15:17.458
I, um, I was wondering
if you had time tomorrow

15:17.542 --> 15:20.458
to discuss where we are in food
shipments to Narn outposts?

15:20.542 --> 15:23.125
Yes, of course, of course.
Just let me know when.

15:24.750 --> 15:26.458
Are you alright?

15:26.542 --> 15:28.667
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.333
Actually, I'm not fine.

15:30.417 --> 15:33.167
It's been one hell
of a day, ambassador.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.917
Do you wish to talk about it?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.333
[sighs]
No.

15:39.542 --> 15:42.667
Why is it every time you finally
get things calmed down

15:42.750 --> 15:45.250
and everything's going great..

15:45.333 --> 15:48.917
...life decides
to kick you in the butt?

15:50.667 --> 15:52.042
But what?

15:53.083 --> 15:54.333
What?

15:54.417 --> 15:57.458
You said that life decides
to kick you, but..

15:59.417 --> 16:02.125
No. No, it's, um..

16:02.208 --> 16:03.458
[chuckles]

16:03.542 --> 16:05.542
Uh, it's a,
it's a part of the body.

16:05.625 --> 16:07.083
Uh, it's, um..

16:08.417 --> 16:11.875
Oh, you have the damnedest gaps
in your vocabulary.

16:11.958 --> 16:14.375
Well, in preparing to come here

16:14.458 --> 16:16.208
I was not taught the more, um

16:16.292 --> 16:18.458
colorful aspects
of your language.

16:18.542 --> 16:21.750
It was considered inappropriate
for one of the religious castes.

16:21.833 --> 16:23.625
Yeah, well,
you're missing out on a lot.

16:23.708 --> 16:25.708
So I gather.

16:25.792 --> 16:27.000
Butt.

16:27.917 --> 16:29.458
Butt.

16:29.542 --> 16:32.875
I butt, you butt,
he or she butts.

16:32.958 --> 16:36.083
- No, no, it's, um--
- Uh, butt-butt.

16:36.167 --> 16:38.875
- Butt-butt?
- 'You sound like a motor boat.'

16:38.958 --> 16:40.250
Motor-butt?

16:40.333 --> 16:42.750
I do not think
I like the sound of that.

16:42.833 --> 16:45.250
Well, I don't blame you.
I'm against the whole idea.

16:45.333 --> 16:48.000
- Then we are in agreement.
- Abso-fragging-lutely.

16:48.083 --> 16:49.083
[both chuckling]

16:49.167 --> 16:50.542
- There you see.
- What?

16:50.625 --> 16:52.750
Something has gone
your way today.

16:52.833 --> 16:55.083
It's the way the universe works.

16:55.167 --> 16:57.167
'Wait just a little while'

16:57.250 --> 16:59.167
'and the wheel turns.'

17:04.375 --> 17:05.917
Thank you.

17:08.125 --> 17:09.083
[beeps]

17:09.167 --> 17:11.292
(Garibaldi)
'Captain?'

17:11.375 --> 17:13.417
'Captain Sheridan?'

17:13.500 --> 17:15.250
Uh, yes, Mr. Garibaldi.

17:15.333 --> 17:17.708
(Garibaldi)
'I finished that, uh,
background check you wanted.'

17:18.958 --> 17:21.167
Uh, yeah. I'll be right there.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.708
[sighs]
Well, I have to go.

17:27.417 --> 17:29.167
Well, um..

17:33.375 --> 17:35.250
Good day, captain.

17:36.375 --> 17:38.292
Good day, ambassador.

17:38.375 --> 17:39.833
Okay.

17:44.583 --> 17:46.458
(Garibaldi)
I checked out her stories
as far as I could

17:46.542 --> 17:48.625
'without raising
any red flags back home.'

17:48.708 --> 17:50.917
Dr. Franklin's contacts
inside the underground railroad

17:51.000 --> 17:52.583
confirmed that
they helped her get off Earth.

17:52.667 --> 17:53.875
So that much tracks.

17:53.958 --> 17:55.250
Unless she's a plant.

17:55.333 --> 17:56.625
Hell, she could
have been sent here

17:56.708 --> 17:58.083
to cause exactly
this kind of problem.

17:58.167 --> 17:59.417
Well, it's possible,
but not likely.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.125
- That's not her style.
- Come on, Michael.

18:01.208 --> 18:03.750
You don't know her well enough
to be sure about that.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.333
She was only here a few months
before they yanked her back home

18:06.417 --> 18:08.500
and remember,
it was because of her

18:08.583 --> 18:09.958
that Sinclair
was almost convicted

18:10.042 --> 18:11.417
of a crime he didn't commit.

18:11.500 --> 18:14.500
Yeah, I know, I know,
but it's just a, a gut feeling.

18:14.583 --> 18:17.167
Everything in me says
she's telling the truth.

18:17.250 --> 18:18.750
Okay, say you're right.

18:18.833 --> 18:20.292
What about your second?

18:20.375 --> 18:23.250
The one who shot you in the back
last New Year's Eve?

18:23.333 --> 18:24.875
Maybe that's what
she heard about.

18:24.958 --> 18:27.333
Maybe he was this Control.

18:27.417 --> 18:28.708
- That's possible.
- Yeah.

18:28.792 --> 18:30.667
She'd have no way
of knowing he was gone.

18:30.750 --> 18:34.333
Exactly.
If she was telling the truth.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.375
And that's one hell of a big if.

18:37.542 --> 18:39.792
- Hmm.
- Uh, look, it's late.

18:39.875 --> 18:42.833
Uh, we've been going
at this all day.

18:42.917 --> 18:46.167
I wanna sleep on this
before we make a decision.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.542
Hmm. It's waited this long.
It can wait a few more hours.

18:49.625 --> 18:52.333
Have you, uh, talked to Ivanova
anymore about this?

18:52.417 --> 18:54.542
Well, she's still on a rampage.

18:54.625 --> 18:56.708
You know how she is about
letting any telepath near her.

18:56.792 --> 18:58.750
Yeah. She'll get over it, huh?

18:59.875 --> 19:01.292
Yeah.

19:16.750 --> 19:19.083
[clattering]

19:19.167 --> 19:22.000
That's one cabinet that will
never threaten us again.

19:22.083 --> 19:23.292
[chuckles]

19:23.375 --> 19:25.000
I'm sorry, I just..

19:25.083 --> 19:27.458
It's been one of those days.

19:27.542 --> 19:30.292
- Did you like your shower?
- It was glorious.

19:30.375 --> 19:33.125
I haven't had a real
hot water shower in ages.

19:33.208 --> 19:35.375
- You want some tea?
- I'd love some.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.583
Talia.

19:38.667 --> 19:41.292
Did you ever know a telepath
named Lyta Alexander?

19:43.125 --> 19:46.208
Uh, yes.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.917
She was a year behind me
at the academy.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
We spent six months together
in an intern program

19:53.083 --> 19:54.875
working for different parts
of the Corps.

19:54.958 --> 19:56.708
Why?

19:56.792 --> 19:58.833
Well, do you think..

19:58.917 --> 20:00.917
...that she's someone
you could trust?

20:02.500 --> 20:03.667
I guess so.

20:03.750 --> 20:05.375
'But you're not sure.'

20:06.500 --> 20:08.292
Susan, it was a long time ago.

20:08.375 --> 20:12.458
She was very nice, very...sweet.

20:12.542 --> 20:15.500
We were close at one time.

20:15.583 --> 20:17.792
And I suppose people
can change, but Lyta?

20:17.875 --> 20:20.792
No, I, I just don't
see it happening.

20:20.875 --> 20:22.917
You said you both interned
with the Corps.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.958
Which department
did she intern with?

20:26.042 --> 20:27.833
Psi Corps.

20:27.917 --> 20:29.333
When she found out
she didn't like it

20:29.417 --> 20:30.917
she changed departments.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.750
Became a commercial teep
like me.

20:33.833 --> 20:37.875
Oh, uh, teeps, it's, uh, sort of
an in-joke around the Corps.

20:37.958 --> 20:41.125
Teeps for telepaths,
teeks for telekinetics.

20:42.250 --> 20:43.625
[sighs]

20:43.708 --> 20:45.625
- What's wrong, Susan?
- Damn it, Talia.

20:45.708 --> 20:47.667
I don't know
who I can trust anymore.

20:49.167 --> 20:51.542
It's funny. I've felt
the same way lately.

20:54.833 --> 20:56.958
So I've come to the decision

20:57.042 --> 20:59.458
that there's only one person
on this station

20:59.542 --> 21:01.542
that I can trust implicitly.

21:03.167 --> 21:04.250
You.

21:11.042 --> 21:12.250
I got a job for you.

21:12.333 --> 21:14.208
There's a special prisoner
in Holding Cell Eight

21:14.292 --> 21:15.917
Lyta Alexander.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.542
When things quiet down,
I wanna transfer her to 15.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.167
There's a decent bed in there.
She may be with us for a while.

21:21.250 --> 21:22.667
- Will do, chief.
- Hey.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.708
Uh, are you still flacking
for night watch?

21:24.792 --> 21:26.333
Hey, it's easy money.

21:26.417 --> 21:28.542
And as long as Ministry of Peace
is gonna keep paying for us

21:28.625 --> 21:31.042
to wear these things,
I'll keep wearing them.

21:35.583 --> 21:37.875
[exhales deeply]

21:48.958 --> 21:52.000
[dramatic music]

22:05.583 --> 22:07.292
Ma'am, we're supposed
to transfer you

22:07.375 --> 22:09.583
to a better facility,
so you can get some sleep.

22:09.667 --> 22:12.083
Well, thanks. I could use it.

22:12.167 --> 22:13.667
This way, please.

22:19.458 --> 22:22.500
[music continues]

22:30.167 --> 22:31.417
[gunshot]

22:31.500 --> 22:32.875
Get behind me.

22:34.292 --> 22:35.500
[grunts]

22:37.708 --> 22:39.958
[laser firing]

22:49.000 --> 22:50.750
In here. Come on.

22:53.167 --> 22:55.917
(Sheridan)
You've had no sign of her
since last night?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.292
- No, sir.
- How are the guards?

22:57.375 --> 22:58.833
One dead,
the other got hit pretty hard.

22:58.917 --> 23:01.292
Second-degree PPG burns
to the arm and chest.

23:01.375 --> 23:03.292
Didn't see who did the shooting,
but it was pretty clear

23:03.375 --> 23:05.125
Lyta was the target.

23:05.208 --> 23:07.542
Oh, great,
this is just great.

23:07.625 --> 23:09.292
You know, I almost
had myself convinced

23:09.375 --> 23:11.792
that she was wrong
and now this happens.

23:11.875 --> 23:12.958
Captain, with all due respect,
this still

23:13.042 --> 23:14.083
does not prove anything.

23:14.167 --> 23:15.125
No?

23:15.208 --> 23:16.833
Who knew she was here, huh?

23:16.917 --> 23:19.667
You, me, Garibaldi, Franklin
and a few other people.

23:19.750 --> 23:21.792
- So who pulled the trigger?
- I don't know.

23:21.875 --> 23:23.667
Well, neither do I
and that's what's bothering me.

23:23.750 --> 23:25.500
Look, Lyta said
this artificial personality

23:25.583 --> 23:27.500
was programmed to defend itself.

23:27.583 --> 23:29.292
If that's true,
then whoever tried to kill her

23:29.375 --> 23:31.292
probably doesn't even remember.

23:31.375 --> 23:33.000
- It could be anyone.
- Come on, Michael.

23:33.083 --> 23:34.875
This is serious,
I want her found

23:34.958 --> 23:36.750
and placed
under protective custody

23:36.833 --> 23:38.417
till we get to
the bottom of this.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.667
- Will do.
- One other thing.

23:43.167 --> 23:44.958
With this latest incident,
I am leaning toward

23:45.042 --> 23:47.542
letting her perform
a telepathic probe.

23:47.625 --> 23:49.417
Captain, I wouldn't
submit to a scan

23:49.500 --> 23:51.417
to prove my loyalty last year
and I won't submit to a--

23:51.500 --> 23:53.708
This isn't gonna be
the same thing.

23:53.792 --> 23:55.250
She's not gonna be
scanning anyone

23:55.333 --> 23:56.750
or invading their privacy.

23:56.833 --> 23:59.083
She's just going
to send the password.

23:59.167 --> 24:00.542
- I don't want to be--
- Look, Susan!

24:00.625 --> 24:03.333
I know how you feel, alright?

24:03.417 --> 24:04.875
If someone on staff
has been compromised

24:04.958 --> 24:06.292
we need to know that.

24:06.375 --> 24:09.208
Our careers, our lives
are on the line here.

24:11.042 --> 24:15.500
Now we have to know that we can
trust each other or we are dead.

24:15.583 --> 24:18.208
And we can't do that as long as
this is hanging over our heads.

24:18.292 --> 24:20.250
It's the only way
we can be sure.

24:21.625 --> 24:25.042
Assuming she lives
long enough to try it.

24:25.125 --> 24:26.875
(Delenn)
'And I have reconsidered
your offer'

24:26.958 --> 24:30.167
to open up trade relations
with the Lumati.

24:30.250 --> 24:31.417
Um..

24:34.458 --> 24:36.375
I, uh, I regret, however

24:36.458 --> 24:39.542
that under present
diplomatic circumstances, um..

24:39.625 --> 24:41.125
[telescreen beeps]

24:41.208 --> 24:42.375
Receive.

24:43.125 --> 24:44.792
Ambassador Delenn?

24:44.875 --> 24:46.542
Yes.

24:46.625 --> 24:47.958
I don't know if you remember me

24:48.042 --> 24:49.458
but I mediated
some business deals for you

24:49.542 --> 24:50.833
about two years ago.

24:50.917 --> 24:53.292
Of course. Lyta, yes?
Lyta Alexander.

24:53.375 --> 24:55.375
Are you, are you back
on Babylon 5?

24:55.458 --> 24:57.708
Yes, uh, I am sorry
for imposing on you

24:57.792 --> 24:59.625
at this hour,
but I need your help.

24:59.708 --> 25:03.083
Can you meet me in Brown Three
in, say, an hour?

25:03.167 --> 25:04.875
I think so.

25:04.958 --> 25:07.167
Are you in some kind of trouble?

25:07.250 --> 25:08.583
Ambassador, I think
I'm in just about

25:08.667 --> 25:10.500
every kind of trouble there is.

25:10.583 --> 25:12.542
I'll meet you in an hour.

25:19.667 --> 25:22.125
Well, Susan, good.
I was hoping to see you.

25:22.208 --> 25:24.000
They finally fixed
the air recycling system

25:24.083 --> 25:25.583
and I can go back
to my regular quarters.

25:25.667 --> 25:27.292
If I can get my things..

25:27.375 --> 25:28.917
Of course.

25:33.500 --> 25:36.917
(Talia)
We didn't have much of a chance
to talk this morning.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.958
- Is everything alright?
- Yeah, fine.

25:39.042 --> 25:42.083
Uh, just got a lot of things
on my mind right now.

25:42.167 --> 25:43.625
You wanna talk about it?

25:43.708 --> 25:46.250
Not now. Maybe later.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.417
I woke up last night
and you were gone.

25:52.167 --> 25:54.750
I needed some air.

25:54.833 --> 25:57.500
Like I said, I've got a lot
of things on my mind right now.

25:58.875 --> 26:01.292
Things are changing so quickly.

26:01.375 --> 26:04.708
Are you sure
there's nothing I can do?

26:04.792 --> 26:07.875
I don't think there's anything
anyone can do for me right now.

26:10.083 --> 26:11.292
I've..

26:12.792 --> 26:14.583
I've hidden things, Talia.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.125
We all have secrets.

26:17.208 --> 26:19.417
Yes, but mine might come back
and haunt me.

26:22.208 --> 26:23.708
After you tell someone
that you've been lying

26:23.792 --> 26:26.333
to them for years..

26:26.417 --> 26:29.167
...maybe even putting them
in jeopardy..

26:29.250 --> 26:31.333
...how are you supposed
to look them in the eyes again?

26:32.792 --> 26:36.500
All I know is you're surrounded
by people who care about you.

26:36.583 --> 26:39.333
There is nothing you could say
that would be so terrible

26:39.417 --> 26:41.917
that they would turn away.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.292
[scoffs]
I don't know about that.
This one is a real doozie.

26:45.375 --> 26:46.583
'Maybe.'

26:48.375 --> 26:50.708
For what it's worth..

26:50.792 --> 26:53.167
...I'm here for you..

26:53.250 --> 26:55.125
...if you need me.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.042
Captain?

27:10.125 --> 27:11.583
Captain, I need to talk
to you for a moment.

27:11.667 --> 27:13.083
I'm in kind of
a hurry, ambassador.

27:13.167 --> 27:14.792
Good. So am I.

27:17.333 --> 27:19.500
I just received a message
from Lyta Alexander.

27:19.583 --> 27:21.208
I believe
you're looking for her.

27:21.292 --> 27:24.083
That's putting it mildly.
Where is she?

27:24.167 --> 27:26.417
She asked me not to give you
that information

27:26.500 --> 27:28.708
and I'm honor-bound
to keep that promise.

27:28.792 --> 27:30.500
But she gave me
a message for you.

27:30.583 --> 27:33.958
She's willing to come back, but
only if all of you are present.

27:34.042 --> 27:36.708
She doesn't want to be alone
with any of you.

27:36.792 --> 27:38.208
And she didn't explain?

27:38.292 --> 27:41.458
No, and I did not ask
out of respect.

27:43.958 --> 27:46.292
Alright, if she makes contact
with you again

27:46.375 --> 27:48.042
tell her that we will be
ready to meet with her

27:48.125 --> 27:49.667
whenever she wants.

27:49.750 --> 27:51.250
Thank you, captain.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.417
I let myself in.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.708
You should change
your lock code more often.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.292
You okay?

28:22.708 --> 28:23.917
[sighs]

28:25.583 --> 28:28.000
I'm sorry. I, I thought
I was ready for this.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.208
Ready for what?

28:32.417 --> 28:35.792
I can't have Lyta
or any other telepath

28:35.875 --> 28:39.375
in my mind...ever.

28:39.458 --> 28:43.417
- I understand your feelings.
- No. You don't understand.

28:44.750 --> 28:46.208
You can't.

28:47.792 --> 28:49.792
'Cause I haven't told you.

28:50.833 --> 28:52.417
Told me what?

28:54.042 --> 28:56.292
I told you that
my mother was a telepath.

28:57.708 --> 29:01.833
And that since I was born,
she could slip into my thoughts

29:01.917 --> 29:04.458
in a way that I could never
even describe to you.

29:06.458 --> 29:07.917
Well, what I didn't tell you..

29:09.458 --> 29:12.167
...is that I learned how to
keep her out when I wanted to.

29:13.792 --> 29:15.667
And then every once in a while..

29:17.417 --> 29:19.750
...I was the one
who touched her mind.

29:24.167 --> 29:26.250
I'm a latent telepath.

29:36.708 --> 29:39.333
Susan, why didn't you
tell me this before?

29:39.417 --> 29:40.875
I thought we could
trust each other.

29:40.958 --> 29:43.417
It's got nothing
to do with trust.

29:43.500 --> 29:46.167
I've spent my entire life
hiding this, captain.

29:46.250 --> 29:48.708
It's not something you can
just change overnight.

29:50.167 --> 29:52.500
It's hard enough
telling you this now.

29:54.208 --> 29:55.708
Well, you're right.

29:56.792 --> 29:58.625
I'm sorry.

29:58.708 --> 30:00.125
For as long as I can remember,
my mother drilled

30:00.208 --> 30:03.792
three words into my head,
tell no one.

30:03.875 --> 30:05.708
She taught me how to fool
the tests given at school

30:05.792 --> 30:07.167
transferred me
from one school to another

30:07.250 --> 30:09.625
always staying one step
ahead of the Psi Corps.

30:11.833 --> 30:14.625
I'm probably not even a P-1.

30:14.708 --> 30:17.667
I've never been able to read
anyone except my mother.

30:17.750 --> 30:19.917
I can pick up
on feelings sometimes.

30:20.958 --> 30:22.375
I can block a casual scan

30:22.458 --> 30:25.125
and I know instantly
if someone's doing it.

30:25.208 --> 30:27.042
- Nothing more.
- 'Hmm.'

30:27.125 --> 30:30.042
But that's enough for the
Psi Corps to come pull you in.

30:30.125 --> 30:33.250
Well, Lyta isn't with the Corps.
She's on the run.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.042
- How can you be sure of that?
- Well, I can't.

30:35.125 --> 30:37.333
But Garibaldi believes her.

30:37.417 --> 30:39.292
Garibaldi doesn't
believe anyone.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.208
[scoffs]
Exactly.

30:44.792 --> 30:47.917
I know how hard this must have
been for you to tell me this.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.833
So let me think about it.

30:51.708 --> 30:53.458
Maybe we can work something out.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.333
Okay.

30:58.333 --> 31:00.042
It's all this nonsense lately.

31:01.375 --> 31:03.792
Some days I don't even know
who I am anymore.

31:06.667 --> 31:09.125
[intense music]

31:12.875 --> 31:14.500
Shh.

31:18.792 --> 31:20.625
Do you know who I am?

31:22.042 --> 31:23.500
Captain?

31:25.583 --> 31:27.417
Hmm.

31:27.500 --> 31:30.958
I just remembered a dream
I had a couple of months ago.

31:31.667 --> 31:32.625
I..

31:32.708 --> 31:34.458
[beeping]

31:34.542 --> 31:36.208
Sheridan.

31:36.292 --> 31:38.958
(male #3)
'Message for you from
Ambassador Delenn, captain.'

31:39.042 --> 31:42.208
- What's the message?
- 'One word. "Now."'

31:44.625 --> 31:47.667
[dramatic music]

31:57.583 --> 31:59.583
Do you wish me to stay with you?

31:59.667 --> 32:02.000
No. I think I'll be okay.

32:02.083 --> 32:04.167
Thank you for your help, Delenn.

32:09.125 --> 32:12.000
- So are we gonna do this?
- Yes.

32:12.083 --> 32:14.833
- You'll start with me.
- You're sure?

32:14.917 --> 32:18.167
I can't ask anyone else to do
this until I've done it myself.

32:21.792 --> 32:23.292
Send the password.

32:24.167 --> 32:26.417
[intense music]

32:28.042 --> 32:30.792
- Well, when do you start?
- I've already done it.

32:30.875 --> 32:32.458
You're clean.

32:34.917 --> 32:36.417
Alright, doctor.

32:46.125 --> 32:47.625
Nothing. You're clean.

32:49.292 --> 32:50.958
Mr. Garibaldi?

32:54.125 --> 32:57.208
[music continues]

33:00.333 --> 33:02.083
[groans]

33:06.292 --> 33:07.625
Boo.

33:07.708 --> 33:08.708
Gotcha.

33:08.792 --> 33:10.875
[Garibaldi laughs]

33:10.958 --> 33:14.375
Michael, you ever do that
to me again.

33:14.458 --> 33:18.208
I'm sorry. Just couldn't
help myself. Ivanova?

33:18.292 --> 33:20.958
Uh, we're going to hold off
on Ivanova for now.

33:21.042 --> 33:22.417
We've got plenty
of other people to check

33:22.500 --> 33:24.500
and I suggest we get to it.

33:28.667 --> 33:30.667
You said you needed to see me?

33:30.750 --> 33:31.750
Yes, I did.

33:31.833 --> 33:33.792
Umm, I just wanna say that

33:33.875 --> 33:35.875
I think you're doing
a very good job.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.375
- That'll be all.
- Oh.

33:41.458 --> 33:43.208
Well, thank you.

33:45.833 --> 33:47.333
(Garibaldi)
'Next.'

33:50.375 --> 33:52.208
- Zack.
- Sir.

33:52.292 --> 33:54.417
- Thank you for coming.
- Yes, sir.

33:58.583 --> 34:00.083
That'll be all.

34:00.167 --> 34:01.792
That's it, sir?

34:01.875 --> 34:04.417
Yes, yes, you can go.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.250
Thank you, sir.

34:09.375 --> 34:10.792
(Garibaldi)
'Next.'

34:13.708 --> 34:16.000
Thank you for coming.

34:16.083 --> 34:18.500
I've been, uh, evaluating
your recent work.

34:18.583 --> 34:20.708
Congratulations. Well done.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.417
- Thank you, sir.
- That'll be all. Thank you.

34:25.375 --> 34:28.417
[dramatic music]

34:45.875 --> 34:47.333
At ease.

34:47.917 --> 34:49.083
Hey.

34:49.167 --> 34:51.375
- You alright?
- That'll be all, thank you.

34:52.875 --> 34:54.292
Okay.

35:04.750 --> 35:07.208
Alright, thank you.
That'll be all.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.333
- Alright. Anything?
- No, he's clean.

35:13.417 --> 35:15.083
They've all been clean.

35:15.167 --> 35:17.708
If the password worked,
you'd see a definite reaction.

35:17.792 --> 35:19.917
So what are we supposed
to do now, huh?

35:20.000 --> 35:21.458
Just keep on going?

35:21.542 --> 35:23.208
We've got over 5000
technical staff here

35:23.292 --> 35:25.167
and that doesn't even
include the Docker's Guild

35:25.250 --> 35:27.667
medical support,
environmental personnel.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.542
(Lyta)
'The further you go
from the center of power'

35:29.625 --> 35:31.542
the less likely it is,
we're going to find the person

35:31.625 --> 35:33.875
that we're looking for.

35:33.958 --> 35:36.458
I suggest you move those eyes
somewhere else

35:36.542 --> 35:37.750
while you still have them.

35:37.833 --> 35:39.292
- Ivanova.
- I know what she's implying.

35:39.375 --> 35:41.083
Look, no one
is implying anything.

35:41.167 --> 35:43.250
To avoid discovery,
the implanted personality

35:43.333 --> 35:45.917
would do or say anything,
manipulate anyone.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.583
Is that what you think
I'm doing?

35:47.667 --> 35:49.958
Well, you sure as hell
are worried about something.

35:50.042 --> 35:51.625
Mind telling us
what it is you are hiding?

35:51.708 --> 35:53.833
- Damn it, I've had enough--
- 'That's enough!'

35:54.875 --> 35:56.458
Now look at us.

35:56.542 --> 35:58.833
'This is exactly
what Psi Corps wants.'

35:58.917 --> 36:01.042
'They want us paranoid,
afraid of each other.'

36:01.125 --> 36:03.167
Divide and conquer, it's
the oldest rule in the book.

36:03.250 --> 36:04.542
You know that.

36:04.625 --> 36:06.000
Guess it wouldn't be a good time
for me to suggest

36:06.083 --> 36:07.875
we all join hands
and sing "Kumbaya."

36:07.958 --> 36:09.917
- Mr. Garibaldi.
- I'll do it.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.875
(Sheridan)
'This is neither the time
nor the place.'

36:11.958 --> 36:13.833
I said I'll do it.

36:15.167 --> 36:17.333
Now before I change my mind.

36:19.583 --> 36:22.625
[dramatic music]

36:23.875 --> 36:25.667
She's blocking me.

36:28.042 --> 36:29.167
[sighs]

36:31.417 --> 36:33.542
[mumbles]
No, no.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.417
Okay, okay, that's enough,
that's enough.

36:35.500 --> 36:37.167
- Oh.
- Come on.

36:38.833 --> 36:40.083
She's clean.

36:41.250 --> 36:42.542
I'm sorry.

36:43.250 --> 36:44.875
Go to hell.

36:47.125 --> 36:49.958
Ah, captain, there you are.
I was looking for you.

36:53.625 --> 36:55.667
- Oh!
- Talia.

36:55.750 --> 36:58.208
My God, it's her.

36:58.292 --> 36:59.792
- You bitch.
- No, no!

36:59.875 --> 37:02.958
Whoa! Whoa!
Give me that gun!

37:03.042 --> 37:05.792
You blew my cover.
You're dead.

37:05.875 --> 37:07.792
'You hear me? You're dead.'

37:07.875 --> 37:09.000
Get her out of here.

37:09.083 --> 37:10.292
Put her under house arrest now!

37:10.375 --> 37:12.500
The Corps is mother.
The Corps is father.

37:12.583 --> 37:14.500
'You're dead, Lyta Alexander.'

37:14.583 --> 37:17.750
We'll find you.
The Corps will find you.

37:22.167 --> 37:24.292
I still can't believe it.

37:24.375 --> 37:26.708
How could she do this to us?

37:26.792 --> 37:28.458
It's not her fault.

37:28.542 --> 37:30.833
She's been carrying
this artificial personality

37:30.917 --> 37:32.833
all this time
without even knowing it.

37:34.083 --> 37:35.500
It's too late to worry
about that now.

37:35.583 --> 37:37.167
The question is,
how much does she know

37:37.250 --> 37:39.083
about our operation here?

37:39.167 --> 37:41.167
She knows about
the underground railroad.

37:41.250 --> 37:43.333
Now that the Talia we knew
isn't there anymore

37:43.417 --> 37:44.833
she'll probably tell the Corps.

37:44.917 --> 37:46.667
Yeah, but what are they
gonna do about it?

37:46.750 --> 37:48.458
Admit they were foxed?

37:48.542 --> 37:51.667
What happens when they find out
that Stephen here was involved?

37:51.750 --> 37:53.583
Publicly, probably nothing.

37:53.667 --> 37:55.500
Yeah, remember the Corps
came in here to hunt down

37:55.583 --> 37:57.792
and kill telepaths that were
involved in the railroad.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.292
If they press the issue,
that'll come out.

37:59.375 --> 38:00.667
- And they won't want that.
- Yeah.

38:00.750 --> 38:02.042
But they're gonna be
paying a lot more attention

38:02.125 --> 38:03.500
to us from now on.

38:03.583 --> 38:04.958
Now that's my job.

38:05.042 --> 38:07.208
I'll keep them away
as much as I can.

38:08.375 --> 38:09.958
'Any more ideas?'

38:10.042 --> 38:11.292
We have one advantage.

38:11.375 --> 38:12.583
We know about
their sleeper program.

38:12.667 --> 38:14.042
Now they don't want that
revealed any more

38:14.125 --> 38:15.667
than we want our side
to get out.

38:15.750 --> 38:16.958
[scoffs]

38:17.042 --> 38:18.083
That sounds like
an old-fashioned

38:18.167 --> 38:19.542
Mexican standoff to me.

38:19.625 --> 38:21.542
(Garibaldi)
Yeah, well, me too.

38:21.625 --> 38:23.208
But let's not kid ourselves.

38:23.292 --> 38:26.042
She knows a lot.
Phew, yeah.

38:26.125 --> 38:27.583
I guess it could have been
a lot worse though, huh?

38:27.667 --> 38:29.208
Another day or two,
we would've invited her

38:29.292 --> 38:30.625
into our little cell group.

38:30.708 --> 38:33.250
Man, if Lyta had come
aboard one week later--

38:33.333 --> 38:36.000
We'd be standing in front of
a court-martial board right now.

38:37.583 --> 38:39.292
I-is there anything else
that we can use

38:39.375 --> 38:42.833
to protect ourselves,
if necessary?

38:42.917 --> 38:44.167
(Talia)
I think I may be
having a problem

38:44.250 --> 38:45.542
with Ambassador Kosh.

38:45.625 --> 38:48.375
And I kept getting
these images in my head.

38:48.458 --> 38:50.875
It was deliberately provoked.

38:50.958 --> 38:54.042
Well, what was on that
data crystal he gave you?

38:54.125 --> 38:59.083
Reflection, surprise, terror

38:59.167 --> 39:00.750
for the future.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.167
There may be something else.

39:05.250 --> 39:07.042
Let me investigate.
I'll get back to you.

39:07.125 --> 39:08.750
Alright, fine.

39:08.833 --> 39:10.417
- By the way, where's Ivanova?
- I don't know.

39:10.500 --> 39:13.000
She said she had some unfinished
business to take care of.

39:19.917 --> 39:20.958
[doorbell rings]

39:21.042 --> 39:22.375
Yes?

39:25.333 --> 39:27.708
I wanted to see you
before you left.

39:30.417 --> 39:32.917
I know this isn't your fault.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.917
And I hope somewhere there's a..

39:35.000 --> 39:37.167
...part of you
that can still hear me.

39:37.250 --> 39:39.042
[laughs]

39:39.125 --> 39:41.042
Always the romantic.

39:41.875 --> 39:43.750
The program is complete.

39:43.833 --> 39:47.000
The Talia you knew
no longer exists.

39:48.042 --> 39:49.792
There's just me.

39:56.375 --> 39:58.417
You don't know what it's like

39:58.500 --> 40:01.417
living only in the shadows
of her mind.

40:01.500 --> 40:05.167
Watching, laughing
at all of you out here.

40:05.250 --> 40:08.333
Foolish, petty, stupid.

40:09.375 --> 40:12.250
There I was, trapped inside

40:12.333 --> 40:15.542
able to come out only at night
when she was asleep.

40:16.458 --> 40:18.542
Her invisible sister.

40:20.542 --> 40:23.000
And you believed

40:23.083 --> 40:26.375
everything she said to you.

40:26.458 --> 40:29.250
All the things
you wanted to hear.

40:30.500 --> 40:33.042
All the words I whispered
in her thoughts

40:33.125 --> 40:36.167
while she lay sleeping.

40:36.250 --> 40:40.458
The words that would
get her closer to you..

40:42.250 --> 40:44.333
...and to what you knew.

40:44.417 --> 40:46.000
[chuckles]

40:47.583 --> 40:49.958
You should see the look
on your face.

40:51.125 --> 40:56.250
My good and dear friend Susan.

41:01.458 --> 41:02.875
You're right.

41:04.500 --> 41:06.833
The Talia I knew is dead.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.792
Goodbye.

41:15.917 --> 41:18.958
[dramatic music]

41:29.458 --> 41:31.125
I'm back.

41:32.792 --> 41:35.208
I can't stay.

41:35.292 --> 41:36.917
The captain's made sure
I can get away

41:37.000 --> 41:39.375
before the Psi Corps
get here, but..

41:40.917 --> 41:43.083
...I had to see you again

41:43.167 --> 41:45.250
'before my ship leaves.'

41:49.833 --> 41:51.875
I never told them.

41:52.875 --> 41:54.875
I never told anyone.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.083
I hid it all away
in the smallest

41:58.167 --> 42:00.708
tiniest corner of my mind.

42:02.333 --> 42:03.625
They could have killed me
and they still

42:03.708 --> 42:05.500
wouldn't have found it.

42:07.833 --> 42:11.750
Only at night, alone..

42:11.833 --> 42:14.250
...would I open that
small door in my mind

42:14.333 --> 42:16.708
where I kept the memory of you..

42:18.458 --> 42:20.750
...and listen to your voice.

42:20.833 --> 42:23.333
'Listen to you
sing me to sleep.'

42:25.417 --> 42:27.583
I hope I can come back again.

42:28.375 --> 42:30.250
But I don't know.

42:32.708 --> 42:36.000
Until then, Kosh.

42:38.125 --> 42:40.042
I wanna see you again.

42:41.375 --> 42:43.750
Just one more time before I go.

42:45.542 --> 42:48.583
[dramatic music]

42:53.000 --> 42:55.417
[zapping]

43:07.250 --> 43:09.833
[theme music]
