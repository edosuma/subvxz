- That's right, Colonel. I'm with you all the way.

27:39.758 --> 27:42.226
Castellon is an indecisive old man.

<i>William, forgive me, </i>
<i>but these men are our allies. </i>

27:47.198 --> 27:50.895
At any rate, we will go in hard
with our eyes open.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.300
First impression in a country
is very important.

27:53.405 --> 27:56.033
Forgive me, but this is idiotic.

27:56.141 --> 27:58.109
I prefer the last impression.

27:59.978 --> 28:01.946
First and last are often the same.

28:02.047 --> 28:04.481
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>you were a pedant, Henningson. </i>

Excuse me, gentlemen.

[Henningson Grunts] l, who have studied
military strategy with Lubitsch...

28:19.097 --> 28:22.362

one moment, uh, alone, sir?

28:22.467 --> 28:24.662
- Certainly.
- <i>[Man] Shut up, Henningson.! </i>

28:24.769 --> 28:27.237
- What seems to be the problem?
- Well, there's no problem, sir.

28:27.338 --> 28:30.466
I was just wonderin' though
perhaps maybe if, uh...

28:30.575 --> 28:33.442
if I could be excused tomorrow
from being the drum major.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.673
It's just that every time I've seen
pictures of battlefield scenes...

28:36.781 --> 28:39.978
and, uh, I always see the drummer boy
lying dead next to his drum...

28:40.085 --> 28:43.054
and, uh, if it's all the same to you, sir...

28:43.154 --> 28:45.122
I'd like to trade my rifle in
for a drum.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.714
I mean, I'd like to trade
my drum in for a rifle.

28:49.260 --> 28:52.991
As long as you are under my command,
no harm will come to you.

28:54.265 --> 28:56.165
Lieutenant.

28:57.902 --> 28:59.802
Straighten up.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.712
You wanted to see me, sir?

29:09.247 --> 29:12.876
Some men abandon all reason
before going into battle.

29:12.984 --> 29:15.316
They become so seized with fear that...

29:15.420 --> 29:17.888
that often the battle is lost
before it's begun.

29:24.696 --> 29:27.164
I know this will not
happen with you, Timothy.

29:29.868 --> 29:31.995
Thank you for your confidence, sir.

29:34.539 --> 29:38.100
Sir, uh, I feel I have to tell you...

29:38.209 --> 29:41.667
The men are awfully confused about
just what exactly we're fightin' for here.

29:41.780 --> 29:45.443
I mean... I mean, I know, and they know,
that the liberals are our friends...

29:45.550 --> 29:48.849
and the conservatives
are our enemies, but...

29:48.953 --> 29:52.286
well, to tell you the truth, sir,
I can't tell 'em apart.

29:52.390 --> 29:54.358
They all seem the same to me.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.917
That is no concern of yours, Timothy,
nor of the men either.

30:00.064 --> 30:02.032
All you have to remember...

30:02.133 --> 30:04.761
is that our cause is a righteous one.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.205
I know that, sir.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.275
I hope you do, Timothy.

30:15.013 --> 30:16.981
I sincerely hope you do.

30:22.587 --> 30:24.214

Reduced to our present position
by the cowardice of some...

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:31.229
the incapacity of others
and the treachery of many...

01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:33.330
we are yet writing
a page in history...

01:23:33.441 --> 01:23:36.342

I swear that we will never abandon
the cause of Nicaragua.

Let it occupy your every

there is no thought...

Maneuvers designated Operation Big Pine...

from Honduras's border with Nicaragua.

Nicaraguans consider the exercise
a serious act of aggression.

The United States insists
the maneuvers are purely defensive.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:09.139
This maneuver is designed to help
the Hondurans to defend their own country.

01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:15.371
And it doesn't... it doesn't envision
any involvement of U.S. ground forces.

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:21.417
[Announcer] So far, 80,000 U.S. troops
have participated in the maneuvers.

say it's all being done...

here was not lost on some of the troops.
