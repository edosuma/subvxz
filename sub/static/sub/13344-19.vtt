WEBVTT

00:05.773 --> 00:08.242
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY, ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.342 --> 00:10.010
WHERE DOES HE
THINK YOU ARE?

00:10.111 --> 00:11.879
- MAYBE FUCKING REEVES.
- YOUR BOSS?

00:11.979 --> 00:13.447
- MM-HMM.
- IS HE ATTRACTED TO YOU?

00:13.547 --> 00:15.816
- REEVES?
- WHY WOULDN'T HE BE?

00:15.916 --> 00:17.851
WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT ME?

00:17.951 --> 00:19.653
I THINK YOU'RE
FLIRTING WITH ME.

00:19.753 --> 00:22.123
- WHERE'S THE STAIN?
- WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING

00:22.223 --> 00:23.791
TO FEEL WHEN YOU SAW IT?

00:23.891 --> 00:26.194
- NOTHING.
- NO SADNESS?

00:26.294 --> 00:28.162
- OVER A STAIN?
- NO.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.164
OVER THE LOSS
OF YOUR BABY.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.007
I'M GLAD I'M NOT
PREGNANT ANYMORE.

00:40.108 --> 00:42.210
REALLY? REALLY?
YOU'RE GLAD OUR BABY DIED?

00:42.310 --> 00:45.079
YES, I DIDN'T WANT
THIS BABY.

00:45.179 --> 00:48.149
AND FUCKING HELL,
I KNOW WHY.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.151
THIS HAS BEEN
REALLY GREAT, PAUL.

00:50.251 --> 00:53.287
COUPLE MORE OF THESE
AND WE CAN TRADE YOU IN
FOR A GOOD DIVORCE ATTORNEY.

01:33.127 --> 01:35.496
( theme music playing )

01:55.115 --> 01:58.186
HELLO.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.254
YOU LOOK SURPRISED.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.623
WE DO HAVE
A SESSION, DON'T WE?

02:02.723 --> 02:04.425
YES, WE DO.

02:07.395 --> 02:10.531
SO JAKE
ISN'T COMING TODAY?

02:10.631 --> 02:12.933
I DON'T KNOW.

02:13.033 --> 02:14.702
GOT A LIGHT?

02:18.739 --> 02:21.442
- ( door opens )
- AH, HERE HE IS NOW.

02:33.053 --> 02:34.888
Paul:
GOOD AFTERNOON, JAKE.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.657
AFTERNOON.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.695
NO, THANK YOU.

02:56.109 --> 02:59.447
( phone beeps )

03:01.582 --> 03:03.917
WILL YOU EXCUSE
ME FOR A MOMENT?
I HAVE TO TAKE THIS CALL.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.686
THANK YOU.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.459
HELLO.

03:11.559 --> 03:12.926
OH.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.430
THANK YOU FOR
GETTING BACK TO ME.
I APPRECIATE IT.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.466
WELL, ACTUALLY I'M WITH
A PATIENT AT THE MOMENT

03:18.566 --> 03:20.334
SO I'VE GOT
TO MAKE THIS SHORT.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.770
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
SHE CAN GO HOME, YES.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.738
YES.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.109
OKAY.
I OWE YOU ONE.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.744
OH, IS HER MOM THERE?

03:30.844 --> 03:32.880
COULD I SPEAK TO HER
FOR A SECOND, PLEASE?

03:32.980 --> 03:34.548
THANK YOU.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.317
HOW ARE YOU?

03:38.352 --> 03:40.288
PLEASE DON'T WORRY.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.855
WE'LL TALK TOMORROW, OKAY?

03:41.955 --> 03:43.757
SAME TIME.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.526
TAKE CARE, BYE.

03:46.994 --> 03:50.731
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I HAD TO TAKE THAT CALL.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.866
DO YOU USUALLY TAKE CALLS
IN THE MIDDLE OF A SESSION?

03:52.966 --> 03:55.369
THAT'S OKAY.
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
TO ONE OF YOUR PATIENTS?

03:55.469 --> 03:57.471
A FRIEND'S DAUGHTER.
SHE'S OKAY NOW.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.207
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
IF IT WASN'T SERIOUS,

04:00.308 --> 04:02.276
WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO BE AVAILABLE?

04:02.376 --> 04:03.711
WHAT ARE YOU
BITCHING ABOUT?

04:03.811 --> 04:05.413
- I JUST--
- WHAT DID WE LOSE A MINUTE?

04:05.513 --> 04:07.047
NO, I JUST WANT
TO UNDERSTAND.

04:07.147 --> 04:09.082
IT WAS AN EMERGENCY, AMY.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.051
AND I APOLOGIZE.

04:11.151 --> 04:14.054
ACTUALLY, AMY HAS A POINT.
A MINUTE WITH YOU ISN'T CHEAP.

04:14.154 --> 04:15.856
IT'S $200

04:15.956 --> 04:17.991
AT 50 MINUTES.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.460
THAT'D BE...

04:19.560 --> 04:22.296
$4 A MINUTE,
EINSTEIN.

04:25.733 --> 04:29.337
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING
BEFORE YOU CAME IN THAT

04:29.437 --> 04:31.839
NEITHER ONE OF YOU
IS EVER ABSENT.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.107
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
THE PREVIOUS WEEK,

04:34.207 --> 04:37.177
YOU BOTH COME BACK.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.913
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT

04:40.013 --> 04:43.016
I THINK THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
I THINK IT'S HIGHLY COMMENDABLE.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.985
YOU SAYING
WE'RE PREDICTABLE?

04:45.085 --> 04:48.589
- NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT--
- BUT WE ARE. WE ARE.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.658
- WE ARE SO PREDICTABLE.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

04:50.758 --> 04:53.260
IT MEANS THE OPPOSITE
OF UNPREDICTABLE.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.863
WHATEVER IS SAID OR DONE,

04:55.963 --> 04:58.432
EVERYONE COMES HOME
AT THE END OF THE DAY, RIGHT?

04:58.532 --> 05:00.768
AS LONG
AS THE EVERYONE IS ME.

05:00.868 --> 05:03.337
WHEN I LEFT HERE LAST WEEK
I SAID I WASN'T GONNA GO HOME.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.339
BUT WHEN I DID IN FACT
GO HOME LATER,

05:05.439 --> 05:07.274
LENNY WAS ALONE.
HE WAS BY HIMSELF.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.309
JAKE HAD LEFT HIM
AND TOLD HIM

05:09.410 --> 05:10.611
THAT I WOULD BE HOME
TO GIVE HIM DINNER.

05:10.711 --> 05:13.113
WHAT IF I HADN'T
GONE HOME?

05:13.213 --> 05:15.483
I'M SO SORRY
I CHANGED MY MIND.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.418
YOU'RE SORRY YOU CAME
HOME TO YOUR SON?

05:17.518 --> 05:19.820
NO, I'M SORRY YOU WERE
SO SURE THAT I WOULD GO HOME.

05:19.920 --> 05:20.921
WHY IS THAT, AMY?

05:21.021 --> 05:22.823
HE'S TAKING ME
FOR GRANTED.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.558
HE LEFT ALL NIGHT
AND DIDN'T COME BACK.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.927
SO WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT TIME DID YOU GET HOME?

05:27.027 --> 05:28.729
THE NEXT MORNING.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.631
SO IF AMY
HADN'T COME HOME

05:30.731 --> 05:33.200
YOUR SON WOULD'VE
BEEN ALONE ALL NIGHT?

05:33.300 --> 05:34.635
SHE CAME BACK.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.637
SEE WHAT MY WORD
IS WORTH?

05:36.737 --> 05:38.506
I KEEP TELLING YOU,
A LIAR SHOULDN'T EXPECT

05:38.606 --> 05:39.840
THEIR WORD TO BE WORTH
ANYTHING, SWEETIE.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.875
- OH, BABY, YOU THINK I LIE?
- YEAH.

05:41.975 --> 05:45.579
I'M GONNA START SOME REAL LYING
TO TEACH YOU A LESSON.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.793
GOD, WHAT HAPPENED?

06:02.229 --> 06:03.664
WITH WHAT?

06:03.764 --> 06:06.400
WITH US.
I'M ASKING YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.971
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT HAPPENED WAS
WE STARTING COMING HERE.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.440
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.075
ARE YOU SAYING THINGS HAVE
GOTTEN WORSE BETWEEN YOU

06:15.175 --> 06:16.410
SINCE YOU STARTED THERAPY?

06:16.510 --> 06:18.679
OBVIOUSLY, YEAH.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.381
DO YOU FEEL
THAT WAY TOO, AMY?

06:22.450 --> 06:24.084
- MAYBE.
- I TOLD YOU, PAUL.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.019
COUPLE MORE SESSIONS
AND WE'RE GONNA GET DIVORCED.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.321
WHEN DID YOU TELL HIM THAT?

06:28.422 --> 06:30.624
AFTER YOU STORMED
OUT OF HERE LAST WEEK.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.896
Paul:
MAYBE YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE
BECOMING MORE FREQUENT HERE,

06:35.996 --> 06:39.433
BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT MEANS YOU'RE HEADED
FOR THE DIVORCE COURT.

06:39.533 --> 06:42.703
MAYBE YOU'RE ALLOWING
YOURSELF TO--

06:42.803 --> 06:45.973
TO VENT BECAUSE YOU FEEL
THAT SOMEBODY'S IN CHARGE,

06:46.073 --> 06:47.575
I.E., ME.

06:47.675 --> 06:51.078
YOU KNOW, LIKE KIDS WHO
FIGHT ONLY WHEN MOM'S AROUND.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.246
KIDS?
NOW WE'RE KIDS?
JESUS.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.616
THAT SOUNDS LIKE HIM
AND HIS FRIENDS.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.417
THAT'S WHERE HE WAS
THE OTHER NIGHT, BY THE WAY.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.787
SO YOU DID KNOW WHERE
HE WAS THE OTHER NIGHT?

06:59.887 --> 07:02.022
OF COURSE, IT'S ALWAYS
SIMON OR ELIOT.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.858
THE ONE THINKS HE'S
AN ORGANIC FARMER--

07:04.958 --> 07:07.995
DOESN'T DO ANY WORK
AND HE'LL PROBABLY BE BANKRUPT

07:08.095 --> 07:09.530
BY THE END OF THE YEAR;

07:09.630 --> 07:12.500
THE OTHER IS AN ASPIRING
SONGWRITER LIKE JAKE.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.568
HE'S BEEN WRITING SONGS
FOR 20 YEARS

07:14.668 --> 07:16.303
BUT HAS NOTHING
TO SHOW FOR IT.

07:16.403 --> 07:19.673
IT'S ALL VERY UNSUCCESSFUL.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.510
YOU SEE, PAUL, TO AMY
ANYONE WITHOUT A PhD

07:22.610 --> 07:25.078
OR A SWISS BANK ACCOUNT
IS UNSUCCESSFUL.

07:25.178 --> 07:28.181
A PhD?
HOW ABOUT A GED?

07:28.281 --> 07:29.550
THEY'RE LOSERS.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.619
THEY SIT AROUND
AND GET STONED

07:31.719 --> 07:33.554
AND TALK ABOUT
THEIR HARD LUCK.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.322
SHE THINKS ANYONE
WHO SMOKES A JOINT

07:35.422 --> 07:36.824
ON THE WEEKEND
IS A JUNKIE.

07:36.924 --> 07:40.494
BUT APPARENTLY
HER DRINKING IS JUST FINE.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.329
HE GETS UPTIGHT
WHEN I DRINK A LITTLE.

07:42.429 --> 07:44.532
A LITTLE? REALLY?
IS THAT WHAT THAT WAS?

07:44.632 --> 07:47.234
AND I WASN'T UPTIGHT,
I WAS DISGUSTED.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.670
THE WAY YOU WERE...

07:49.770 --> 07:52.773
HANGING ON TO ERIC LIKE--
I DON'T KNOW.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.508
YOU SHOULD'VE
SEEN HER, PAUL.

07:54.608 --> 07:57.310
SHE WAS WALKING AROUND,
GIVING TOASTS

07:57.410 --> 08:00.113
LIKE SHE WAS
MARILYN MONROE OR SOMETHING.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.451
IT USED TO TURN YOU ON

08:04.552 --> 08:06.887
THAT I COULD DRINK
LIKE ONE OF THE GUYS.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.923
YOU USED TO BRAG THAT I COULD
DRINK ANY GUY UNDER THE TABLE

08:10.023 --> 08:11.659
WHEN WE WERE OUT
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

08:11.759 --> 08:14.795
YOU MEAN MY FRIENDS YOU USED
TO THINK WERE SUCH GREAT GUYS?

08:14.895 --> 08:16.997
THOSE FRIENDS?

08:17.097 --> 08:20.668
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID, RIGHT?
REMEMBER?

08:20.768 --> 08:22.603
YOU SAID
IT WAS REFRESHING

08:22.703 --> 08:25.739
THAT THEY WEREN'T THESE
PRETENTIOUS WINDBAGS.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.176
AND THEY FUCKING
WORSHIPPED YOU.

08:29.276 --> 08:32.379
YOU WERE
SO FLATTERED.

08:32.479 --> 08:35.749
YOU WORSHIPPED ME TOO.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.886
YOU USED TO COME HOME
WITH TEQUILA

08:38.986 --> 08:41.989
AND WE'D GET DRUNK
AND FUCK LIKE CRAZY.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.960
WHY ISN'T IT SEXY ANYMORE?
TELL ME.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.129
WHAT--
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:49.229 --> 08:51.131
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I KNOW
THAT IT'S NOT SEXY

08:51.231 --> 08:54.167
TO DRINK AND LAUGH AT YOUR
OWN JOKES LIKE THE OTHER NIGHT.

08:54.267 --> 08:58.005
I KNOW THAT'S NOT SEXY.
THAT'S EMBARRASSING.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.642
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT...

09:01.742 --> 09:03.243
WHENEVER I HEAR
MY PHONE RING

09:03.343 --> 09:05.378
AND I HEAR THAT "GODFATHER"
RINGTONE THAT YOU PUT IN IT,

09:05.478 --> 09:07.748
I FEEL EMBARRASSED.

09:07.848 --> 09:10.117
EVERY TIME YOU SHOW UP
AT MY WORK DRESSED LIKE THAT,

09:10.217 --> 09:11.785
I FEEL EMBARRASSED.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.120
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HOW I DRESS?

09:13.220 --> 09:15.055
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I CAN WORK IN THESE.

09:15.155 --> 09:19.092
AH, YES, YOUR WORK.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.131
IT'S INTERESTING TO ME
THAT THE THINGS THAT--

09:24.231 --> 09:26.266
THAT DREW YOU TOGETHER
IN THE FIRST PLACE

09:26.366 --> 09:28.401
ARE THE THINGS THAT

09:28.501 --> 09:31.438
SEEM TO ANNOY YOU
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

09:31.538 --> 09:34.074
YOU KNOW,
IT'S VERY INTERESTING--

09:34.174 --> 09:35.776
OH, ONE MORE
"IT'S INTERESTING," PAUL,

09:35.876 --> 09:38.779
AND I SWEAR TO GOD I'M GONNA
FUCKING DECK YOU, OKAY?

09:41.114 --> 09:43.316
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

09:43.416 --> 09:47.220
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
THINK HAPPENED

09:47.320 --> 09:49.122
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU?

09:49.222 --> 09:52.559
NOTHING.
LET'S MOVE ON.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.829
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL MOVE ON.
I'LL WATCH MY STEP.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.131
WHAT ARE YOU SCARED OF, PAUL?
I WASN'T REALLY GONNA HIT YOU.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.667
ONLY IF YOU SAY,
"IT'S INTERESTING" AGAIN.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.468
WELL, WHAT BUGS YOU
ABOUT THAT PHRASE?

10:01.568 --> 10:04.037
JUST DON'T TELL ME
THAT MY LIFE

10:04.137 --> 10:06.740
IS SO INTERESTING
TO YOU, OKAY?

10:08.141 --> 10:09.743
IT'S OUR LIFE.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.512
IT'S NOT "PEOPLE"
MAGAZINE.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.414
OKAY.

10:14.514 --> 10:15.916
WHY ISN'T IT INTERESTING?

10:16.016 --> 10:18.418
I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO US IS VERY INTERESTING.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.688
REALLY?
YOU'RE INTERESTED TOO.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.193
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE FIRST TIME WE MET HERE?

10:26.293 --> 10:28.962
YOU TOLD ME THAT
YOUR RELATIONSHIP BEGAN

10:29.062 --> 10:31.699
WITH GREAT LOVE.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.568
I MEAN, YOU BOTH
AGREED ON THAT.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.838
WE HAVEN'T AGREED
ON ANYTHING SINCE.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.442
I HAVEN'T CHANGED,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

10:42.542 --> 10:43.911
YOU KNOW, SHE'S CHANGED.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.346
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
SHE WANTS FROM ME NOW.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.581
I DON'T WANT
ANYTHING FROM YOU.

10:48.682 --> 10:51.051
HOW DO YOU THINK
SHE'S CHANGED, JAKE?

10:52.953 --> 10:54.888
SEEMS LIKE I'M NOT GOOD
ENOUGH FOR HER ANYMORE.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.824
AND I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR HER TO HAVE A KID WITH.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.658
OH, GOD, NOT THAT
AGAIN, PLEASE.

10:58.759 --> 11:02.429
JUST LET IT BE.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.872
AMY, I REMEMBER YOU SAID

11:11.972 --> 11:13.606
THAT WHEN YOU SAW JAKE
FOR THE FIRST TIME

11:13.707 --> 11:16.944
YOU THOUGHT HE WAS
SEXY AS HELL.

11:17.044 --> 11:20.848
I THINK THOSE WERE
YOUR EXACT WORDS.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.953
YEAH, WE, UM--

11:26.053 --> 11:28.155
WE WENT TO THIS CLUB
WITH NICK'S PARTNER

11:28.255 --> 11:30.791
AND JAKE WAS PLAYING.

11:30.891 --> 11:34.227
HE WAS UP ON THE STAGE
SINGING "SHE BELONGS TO ME."

11:36.229 --> 11:39.599
HE WAS BEAUTIFUL.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.234
AND YET NOW,
THE CLOTHES, THE MUSIC,

11:41.334 --> 11:44.571
THE FRIENDS--
THEY ALL SEEM TO ANNOY YOU.

11:44.671 --> 11:47.407
AND, JAKE, YOU'VE REFERRED
TO AMY AS A SNOB.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.242
YOU'VE CALLED HER
A PRINCESS.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.812
MAYBE YOU'VE BOTH
BEEN TRYING TO FORCE

11:51.912 --> 11:53.947
YOUR PERSPECTIVES ON
EACH OTHER ALL THESE YEARS

11:54.047 --> 11:56.917
AND IT'S BECOME A BATTLE
FOR CONTROL.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.585
AND YOU'VE BECOME
SO USED TO IT,

11:58.685 --> 12:02.255
IT'S BECOME PART OF THE DYNAMIC
OF WHO YOU ARE AS A COUPLE.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.926
SO WHY DOESN'T IT
WORK ANYMORE?

12:06.794 --> 12:09.562
WELL, AMY--

12:09.662 --> 12:11.498
AMY HAS A STRONG NEED
TO HAVE A CAREER.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.366
THAT SEEMS
TO STRESS YOU OUT.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.235
IT SEEMS
TO MAKE YOU INSECURE

12:15.335 --> 12:19.072
AND YOU BECOME
POSSESSIVE, JEALOUS.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.308
THAT, IN TURN,
MAKES AMY...

12:21.408 --> 12:23.076
SECRETIVE.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.845
AND SHE LIES.

12:24.945 --> 12:28.681
I GET THE FEELING THAT YOU'RE
BOTH TIRED OF THIS BATTLE

12:28.782 --> 12:30.750
AND THAT SOMEWHERE DEEP
DOWN INSIDE

12:30.851 --> 12:32.886
YOU WANT IT TO STOP.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.688
BUT YOU'RE AFRAID.

12:35.789 --> 12:38.959
YOU'RE AFRAID TO STOP.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.394
BUT I DO KNOW ONE THING:

12:41.494 --> 12:42.996
THERE ARE CASUALTIES.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.933
CASUALTIES?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHO'S A CASUALTY?

12:47.700 --> 12:49.336
LENNY.

12:54.141 --> 12:57.177
SO...

12:57.277 --> 13:00.080
YOU TWO GOT TOGETHER WHILE
AMY WAS STILL MARRIED.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.149
IS THAT CORRECT?
WOULD YOU LIKE TO

13:02.249 --> 13:05.152
TALK ABOUT THAT
A LITTLE BIT, JAKE?

13:08.288 --> 13:11.024
AFTER THEY CAME
TO SEE ME PLAY,

13:11.124 --> 13:13.827
SHE STARTED TAKING
GUITAR LESSONS FROM ME.

13:15.228 --> 13:19.532
SHE WANTED TO LEARN A FEW
CLASSIC SONGS, SHE SAID.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.434
- IT WAS NICK'S IDEA.
- YEAH.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.204
YOU KNOW THE RICH, THEY LOVE
TO TAP INTO THEIR CREATIVE SIDE.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.674
AND DID YOUR EX-HUSBAND
TAKE THESE LESSONS ALSO?

13:27.774 --> 13:30.177
( both laughing )

13:33.513 --> 13:34.948
NO.
NICK WITH A GUITAR?

13:35.048 --> 13:36.616
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

13:36.716 --> 13:39.019
YOU LOVE MAKING
FUN OF HIM.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.988
YOU LOVED IT TOO.
COME ON, IT USED TO
CRACK YOU UP

13:41.088 --> 13:42.589
WHEN I'D TALK ABOUT
HOW UPTIGHT HE WAS.

13:46.359 --> 13:49.696
DO YOU MIND ME ASKING YOU,
HOW DID YOUR AFFAIR--

13:49.796 --> 13:51.331
HOW DID IT BEGIN?

13:54.367 --> 13:56.803
JAKE ASKED ME TO STAY
AFTER THE CLASS.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.907
HE INSISTED THAT I STAY.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.341
TWO TO TANGO.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.877
THE STUDIO WAS OUT
BY GOSSAMER ROAD

14:03.977 --> 14:07.747
AND HE ASKED ME TO GO
FOR A WALK AFTER THE CLASS.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.350
THERE WAS A WOMAN NEARBY
THAT RENTED HORSES.

14:10.450 --> 14:14.021
WE WENT RIDING AT SUNSET.
IT WAS VERY ROMANTIC.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.356
AND WE STOPPED
ALONG THIS RIVER

14:16.456 --> 14:18.926
AND JAKE SAID,
"GET OFF YOUR HORSE."

14:19.026 --> 14:21.428
AND I SAID, "WHY?"
HE SAID, "JUST GET OFF, AMY."

14:21.528 --> 14:25.132
SO I DID,
BUT HE STAYED ON HIS HORSE
AND I COULDN'T SEE HIM

14:25.232 --> 14:26.766
BECAUSE THE SUN WAS
SORT OF BLINDING ME.

14:26.866 --> 14:31.004
AND HE SAID,
"TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES."

14:32.906 --> 14:35.708
AND IT WAS SO SEXY,
I COULDN'T BREATHE.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.477
I WAS SPEECHLESS.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.712
BUT I TOOK THEM OFF.

14:39.812 --> 14:42.950
AND HE GOT OFF HIS HORSE

14:43.050 --> 14:44.384
AND HE CAME OVER TO ME.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.519
I COULD FEEL
HIS BREATH ON MY FACE

14:46.619 --> 14:49.856
AND I COULD HEAR THE HORSES
STAMPING THEIR FEET

14:49.957 --> 14:52.192
AND I JUST--
I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.995
I JUST COULDN'T
HELP MYSELF.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.906
AND WHERE DO I
KNOW THAT FROM?

15:08.141 --> 15:09.943
- DO YOU LIKE IT?
- MM-HMM.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.445
PATRICK THOMAS.
ONE OF YOUR FAVORITES.

15:12.545 --> 15:15.815
OH, RIGHT.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.985
( laughs )

15:18.085 --> 15:20.187
YOU REMEMBERED IT
BY HEART?

15:20.287 --> 15:21.688
I EMBELLISHED
A LITTLE.

15:21.788 --> 15:25.558
SHIT, FOR A MINUTE
THERE I THOUGHT THAT
REALLY HAPPENED.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.327
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED, PAUL,

15:27.427 --> 15:30.063
WAS AFTER ONE
OF THE GUITAR LESSONS

15:30.163 --> 15:33.766
WE WENT OUT FOR A DRINK,
GOT DRUNK AND FUCKED IN HER CAR.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.302
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
AS ROMANTIC AS--

15:35.402 --> 15:37.104
Amy:
NO, IT WAS FORBIDDEN.

15:37.204 --> 15:40.173
IT WAS MESSY.
AND IT TURNED ME ON.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.709
JAKE TOO. HE FELT LIKE
HE WAS SCREWING NICK.

15:42.809 --> 15:45.012
REMEMBER, HE WAS SCREWING
A VERY SUCCESSFUL LAWYER.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.579
- BULLSHIT.
- DON'T SAY BULLSHIT.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.881
YOU TURNED EVERYTHING INTO
A PISSING CONTEST WITH HIM.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.183
HE WAS RICH
AND HE WAS SMART.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.620
AND BORING.
DON'T FORGET THAT.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.623
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.
SHE PUNISHED HIM FOR BORING HER.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.661
DID IT CONCERN YOU AT ALL

16:01.761 --> 16:04.697
THAT AMY WAS MARRIED
AT THE TIME?

16:06.733 --> 16:08.035
LET'S GO BACK FOR A SECOND,

16:08.135 --> 16:10.937
'CAUSE I JUST GOTTA
CORRECT SOMETHING.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.705
FIRST OF ALL,
SHE MADE A PASS AT ME.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.807
I MADE A PASS AT YOU?

16:14.907 --> 16:17.444
YEAH, THIS WHOLE STUFF

16:17.544 --> 16:19.246
ABOUT I INSISTED YOU STAY
AT THE LESSON...

16:19.346 --> 16:21.181
WHAT?
I MEAN, IT'S NONSENSE.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.482
OKAY, IT WAS
AN HOUR LESSON.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.484
THREE HOURS INTO IT
AND I'M THINKING,

16:24.584 --> 16:28.355
"OKAY, THIS WOMAN REALLY
WANTS TO LEARN THIS SONG

16:28.455 --> 16:30.390
OR SHE'S INTO ME."

16:32.259 --> 16:34.427
OKAY, WHEN YOU GOT HERE

16:34.527 --> 16:37.830
THERE WAS A DISTANCE
BETWEEN YOU,

16:37.930 --> 16:39.032
A KIND OF COLDNESS.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.834
THEN I HAD TO TAKE
THAT PHONE CALL,

16:41.934 --> 16:43.803
WHICH WAS AN EMERGENCY,

16:43.903 --> 16:47.374
AND IT SEEMED
LIKE YOU BOTH,

16:47.474 --> 16:50.777
I DON'T KNOW,
GANGED UP ON ME.

16:50.877 --> 16:54.114
DO YOU THINK THE SAME KIND
OF THING HAPPENED WITH NICK?

16:54.214 --> 16:56.283
THAT THAT'S HOW
YOUR INTIMACY WAS CREATED,

16:56.383 --> 16:59.352
WITH A CONSPIRACY
BETWEEN YOU?

16:59.452 --> 17:01.321
I KNOW THAT AMY
IS TRYING

17:01.421 --> 17:03.223
TO STEP OUT OF THE HOUSE,
SO TO SPEAK.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.325
SHE'S BREAKING UP
THAT CONSPIRACY.

17:05.425 --> 17:08.761
SO THAT MAKES YOU UPTIGHT
AND THE CONFLICT BETWEEN YOU...

17:10.130 --> 17:13.200
INTENSIFIES.

17:15.402 --> 17:18.071
- HOW WILL IT END?
- YOU KNOW, IRONICALLY,

17:18.171 --> 17:22.008
SOMETIMES ENDING A CONFLICT
ISN'T THE BEST THING

17:22.109 --> 17:25.612
FOR THE RELATIONSHIP
BECAUSE YOU GET SO USED
TO FIGHTING EACH OTHER

17:25.712 --> 17:27.814
THAT YOU MIGHT LOSE INTEREST

17:27.914 --> 17:31.218
IF THE CONFLICT ENDS.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.757
I THINK JAKE LOST INTEREST
A LONG TIME AGO,

17:37.857 --> 17:39.226
THE MOMENT HE HAD ME.

17:39.326 --> 17:40.927
I DIDN'T LOSE INTEREST.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.096
YOU BECAME INTERESTED
IN YOUR BOSS.

17:43.196 --> 17:46.566
I AM NOT INTERESTED IN BEN.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.836
NOW IT'S BEN.

17:49.936 --> 17:52.272
YOU ARE SUCH
A FUCKING LIAR.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.741
DON'T CALL ME A LIAR.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.209
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO TELL YOU, BABY?
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.644
AND WHAT ARE YOU?

17:57.744 --> 18:00.247
GUYS, WE KEEP COMING BACK
TO THE SAME THING.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.748
Amy:
NO, YOU'RE A QUITTER, OKAY?

18:01.848 --> 18:03.716
HE'S A WINNER.
IF YOU HAD A QUARTER
OF THE STRENGTH

18:03.816 --> 18:06.719
THAT BEN HAS, I'D BE
INTERESTED IN YOU TOO.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.923
WHERE ARE YOU FUCKING HIM?
YOU FUCKED HIM ALREADY?

18:11.023 --> 18:12.459
HAVE YOU FUCKED
SIMON AND ELIOT?

18:12.559 --> 18:14.060
NO, YOU HAVEN'T
FUCKED HIM ALREADY.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.962
- BUT YOU WANT TO, DON'T YOU?
- OH, GOD.

18:16.062 --> 18:17.930
YEAH, YOU DO.
YOU JUST SAID YOU DID.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.299
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
YOU'RE INSANE.

18:19.399 --> 18:20.867
NO, YOU DID. YOU DID.
YOU JUST SAID

18:20.967 --> 18:23.303
IF I HAD A QUARTER OF
THE STRENGTH BEN REEVES HAS,

18:23.403 --> 18:24.937
YOU'D BE INTERESTED
IN ME TOO.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.274
YOU SAID TOO.
THAT MEANS YOU'RE
INTERESTED IN REEVES.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.875
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
- YOU JUST-- PAUL--

18:28.975 --> 18:31.744
YOU JUST SAID--
AMY, I KNOW IT'S REALLY
HARD FOR YOU, BABE,

18:31.844 --> 18:33.380
BUT TRY NOT TO
FUCKING LIE, OKAY?

18:33.480 --> 18:35.548
- STOP CALLING ME A LIAR.
- IF YOU STOP LYING,
I'LL STOP.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.784
- TELL HIM TO STOP
OR I'M LEAVING.
- YOU'RE A LIAR!

18:37.884 --> 18:39.819
- THAT'S IT, I'M LEAVING.
- YOU ARE A FUCKING LIAR!

18:39.919 --> 18:41.788
- GOD DAMN IT! STOP IT!
- AMY!

18:41.888 --> 18:44.023
VIOLENT AND A LIAR.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.758
( phone beeping )

18:45.858 --> 18:48.428
Amy:
You're a quitter, okay?
He's a winner.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.563
If you had a quarter of
the strength that Ben has,

18:50.663 --> 18:52.599
I'd be interested
in you too.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.634
( phone beeping )

18:54.734 --> 18:56.769
You're a quitter, okay?
He's a winner.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.405
If you had a quarter
of the strength that Ben has,

18:58.505 --> 19:00.773
I'd be interested
in you too.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.409
( phone beeping )

19:02.509 --> 19:04.777
You're a quitter, okay?
He's a winner.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.946
If you had a quarter of
the strength that Ben has,

19:07.046 --> 19:08.715
I'd be interes--

19:18.991 --> 19:21.528
YOU PSYCHOPATH.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.231
DON'T COUNT ON ME
COMING HOME TONIGHT.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.333
I'M NOT COMING
BACK THIS TIME.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.116
SHE'S OUT OF CONTROL.

19:44.217 --> 19:46.286
I'M AFRAID SHE MIGHT
HURT SOMEBODY--

19:46.386 --> 19:49.188
ME, LENNY, HERSELF.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.394
SHE'S LIKE A...

19:54.494 --> 19:57.730
GETAWAY DRIVER IN A CAR
WITHOUT SEAT BELTS.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.268
A GETAWAY DRIVER
WITHOUT SEAT BELTS?

20:01.368 --> 20:02.935
WHERE DID THAT IMAGE
COME FROM?

20:03.035 --> 20:05.605
I DON'T KNOW.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.945
I-- IT WAS IN
THIS DREAM I HAD.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.418
SHE'S, UH--

20:18.518 --> 20:20.853
SHE'S DRIVING MY CAR

20:20.953 --> 20:22.589
DOWNHILL VERY FAST

20:22.689 --> 20:26.192
AND WE'RE NOT
WEARING SEAT BELTS.

20:26.293 --> 20:28.027
SHE LOOKS OVER AT ME

20:28.127 --> 20:29.862
AND SMILES.

20:29.962 --> 20:34.767
BUT I CAN TELL THAT SHE'S
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING.

20:34.867 --> 20:38.938
SHE TELLS ME THAT
SHE NEEDS HAND LOTION.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.144
IT'S CRAZY,

20:45.244 --> 20:47.747
BUT WE'RE GONNA
GO ROB KIEHL'S.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.115
WHAT'S KIEHL'S?

20:49.215 --> 20:50.617
IT'S THIS COSMETICS STORE

20:50.717 --> 20:52.785
THAT MAKES THE HAND LOTION
THAT SHE LIKES.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.087
ANYWAY, IN THE DREAM

20:55.187 --> 20:57.590
I FORGOT
TO BUY IT FOR HER.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.259
AND SHE HAD ASKED ME
A THOUSAND TIMES

21:00.360 --> 21:03.463
NOT TO FORGET
AND I FUCKING FORGOT.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.698
SO NOW WE'RE SITTING
IN FRONT OF THIS PLACE

21:05.798 --> 21:09.268
AND SHE WANTS ME
TO BREAK INTO IT.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.542
( sighs )

21:29.922 --> 21:31.591
DO YOU, UH--

21:35.061 --> 21:36.996
DO YOU THINK
SHE LOVES ME?

21:38.465 --> 21:40.099
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- I DON'T KNOW.

21:40.199 --> 21:43.736
CAN YOU JUST
ANSWER THE QUESTION?

21:44.704 --> 21:47.540
- I THINK SHE LOVES YOU.
- YEAH?

21:47.640 --> 21:52.545
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
YOU LOVE HER TOO, JAKE.

21:52.645 --> 21:56.416
YEAH, WHAT MAKES
YOU SAY THAT?

22:00.487 --> 22:03.423
LOVE IS NOT
THE PROBLEM, JAKE.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.729
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
HAVE YOU EVER RECORDED

22:09.829 --> 22:12.565
THE FIGHTS THAT YOU'VE
HAD WITH HER BEFORE?

22:12.665 --> 22:15.902
- YEAH.
- YOU HAVE?

22:16.002 --> 22:19.071
AND WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

22:22.475 --> 22:24.811
I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO US.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.192
SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK

22:40.292 --> 22:42.094
WE'LL BE SURPRISING
YOU NEXT WEEK.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.196
SURPRISING ME HOW?

22:44.296 --> 22:46.633
BY SHOWING UP HERE
TOGETHER.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.960
( theme music playing )
