Where is my mirror?

Not unless it's suddenly turned invisible.

-Where is my mirror?
-What?

02:00.585 --> 02:02.963
The magnifying mirror.
The one from my desk.

02:03.047 --> 02:05.424
The one I've seen you use
for your eyebrows.

02:05.507 --> 02:06.759
I don't know.

02:10.345 --> 02:13.683
I'm not sleeping.
I can't sleep.

02:16.143 --> 02:18.729
Wake up.
My mirror is missing.

02:18.813 --> 02:21.023

It would be pretty dumb to steal from you.

I kept myself up.

-Where is my mirror?
-On the desk?

02:31.450 --> 02:34.244
She wouldn't steal from you.
She's terrified of you.

02:35.913 --> 02:38.457
Why would I want to look
at myself in the mirror?

02:39.333 --> 02:42.127
Hey, Reznikov.
It's time to make the donuts.

02:42.211 --> 02:44.839
I'm not ready.
And my mirror is missing.

02:44.922 --> 02:47.091
I don't give a tiger's testicle.

02:47.174 --> 02:48.633

the faster I can get back
to my mindfulness practice.

So, let's go!

02:52.054 --> 02:53.973

is more valuable than mine?

02:54.056 --> 02:55.640
Fine. Fine.

02:55.725 --> 02:57.935
I'll put my face on in the kitchen, huh?

02:58.018 --> 02:59.561
[inmate] Shut up! I'm still asleep!

-You think so?
-[Judy] Mmm.

Check out the stink eye in this place.

04:27.691 --> 04:30.485
You know, maybe that's 'cause
there's a boy in the girls' room.

Everybody was a moron in the '80s.

I don't remember.

06:18.843 --> 06:22.681

06:22.764 --> 06:24.058
Right?

Well, it's starting

some way to clear the air.

06:29.729 --> 06:31.648

supposed to tell anyone yet,

08:48.327 --> 08:52.747

I don't.
Not yet.

09:30.452 --> 09:33.288

12:08.318 --> 12:10.487
So... that's a freebie.

12:10.570 --> 12:15.241
It's cheating if I even
think about somebody else.

12:15.325 --> 12:19.120
Lusting in the heart and all that?
Just like Jimmy Carter says.

12:26.336 --> 12:28.463

He can't give that to you.

13:30.108 --> 13:32.611
Uh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:32.694 --> 13:34.363
Okay, no!

13:34.446 --> 13:36.823
Vinny and I,
we have a future.

13:36.906 --> 13:38.450
Sure.

13:38.533 --> 13:39.701
Or you have no future

13:39.784 --> 13:42.496
'cause you're virtual strangers
living in a fantasy world.

13:43.747 --> 13:45.832
And it's gonna shatter
into a million pieces

13:45.915 --> 13:48.877
when the mundane realities
of day-to-day life

13:48.960 --> 13:53.339
intrude on your maiden-in-a-tower,
prince-down-below fairy-tale bullshit.

13:54.424 --> 13:55.634
'Cause it's retarded.

13:55.717 --> 13:58.720
Plus he's probably been banging the single
mom next door the whole time, anyway,

13:58.803 --> 14:01.390
because who can live on fantasy
and promises for that long, right?

14:01.473 --> 14:03.475
People get lonely.

14:06.645 --> 14:08.730
Or not.
Okay?

14:10.690 --> 14:12.233
Maybe it's the real thing.

14:13.317 --> 14:15.737
I've never met the guy.

14:15.820 --> 14:17.947
For all I know,
maybe it's true love, right?

14:18.698 --> 14:21.743
Are you sure he wouldn't get off
on hearing about you with another chick?

14:23.620 --> 14:25.622
[Piscatella] Owens!
[Owens] Here.

14:25.705 --> 14:27.749
[Piscatella] Piendak!
[Piendak] Here.

14:27.832 --> 14:29.543
[Piscatella] Sankey!
[Sankey] Here.

14:29.626 --> 14:30.710
[Piscatella] Watson!

14:31.795 --> 14:34.255
Let me hear
a verbal confirmation, inmate.

14:34.338 --> 14:35.382
[softly] Here.

14:35.465 --> 14:36.758
A little bit louder now!

14:36.841 --> 14:38.217
-[shouts] Here!
-Ow!

14:38.301 --> 14:39.678
-What?
-Nothing, sorry.

14:39.761 --> 14:41.680
My ear was too close to your mouth.
My bad.

14:41.763 --> 14:46.476
Now, ladies, due to the breach in security
at the Whispers factory,

14:46.560 --> 14:49.771
it has been decided
that all employees of Whispers

14:49.854 --> 14:52.315
will be replaced
with more trustworthy inmates.

14:52.399 --> 14:54.067
Wait, you mean
we ain't got jobs no more?

14:54.150 --> 14:55.610
Means you ain't got that job no more.

14:55.694 --> 14:58.447
But lucky for you,
a new opportunity has knocked.

14:59.406 --> 15:03.785
-Welcome to Construction 101.
-[inmates groan]

15:03.868 --> 15:06.621
So, wait, is this a job
or is this a class?

15:06.705 --> 15:08.122
This is vocational training.

15:08.206 --> 15:11.167
Well, uh, paid vocational training?

15:11.250 --> 15:13.628
We was makin' a dollar an hour
at Whispers.

15:13.712 --> 15:17.757
If you are able to master these skills
and get a job once you're released,

15:17.841 --> 15:20.134
-the paycheck could be in your future.
-[indistinct chatter]

15:20.218 --> 15:24.681
But to be clear as crystal, no money.

15:24.764 --> 15:26.349
For whatever this is.

15:28.101 --> 15:29.686
This is a class.

15:29.769 --> 15:31.395
[inmates groan]

15:31.480 --> 15:32.731
<i>[Ouija] Thanks, jefe.</i>

15:32.814 --> 15:35.191
-Hope it was worth it.
-[Janae] Mmm-hmm.

15:35.274 --> 15:36.985
You gonna fill my commissary now?

15:37.068 --> 15:38.778
Hey, back the fuck off.

15:38.862 --> 15:40.822
[Piscatella] Hey, hey!

15:40.905 --> 15:42.406
Eyes up front.

15:44.117 --> 15:47.621
I will now introduce you
to your construction foreman instructor,

15:47.704 --> 15:48.997
Mr. McDonald.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.374
-[inmates whistling]
-He will walk you through safety training

15:51.458 --> 15:52.959
so we can have an efficient

15:53.042 --> 15:55.754
and incident-free
work-learning environment.

15:55.837 --> 15:57.088
[cheering]

16:00.759 --> 16:03.344
Ooh, baby,
I'd let him jackhammer me.

16:03.427 --> 16:06.014
Mmm, I think I'm gonna need
a lot of instruction.

16:06.097 --> 16:08.683
Please let him be straight.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.685
Wrangler jeans.
He's straight.

16:10.769 --> 16:14.731
Yeah, right.
You can keep me safe, Mr. Mackadocious.

16:14.814 --> 16:16.483
Quiet down, inmates.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.985
Mr. Piscatella?

16:20.236 --> 16:23.990
I have a heart condition,
and I don't know if this whole, you know,

16:24.073 --> 16:28.452
manual labor and heat thing...
it's gonna work for me.

16:28.537 --> 16:31.998
I think I got a bad heart, too.
[whispers] Really bad heart.

16:32.081 --> 16:33.667
Yeah, me, too.

16:33.750 --> 16:37.086
Come up here and we'll find you
an appropriate position...

16:37.170 --> 16:38.421
DeMarco.

16:41.675 --> 16:43.342
I know what position I'd like.

16:43.426 --> 16:44.969
-[clicks tongue]
-[inmates cheer]

16:45.053 --> 16:46.680
That's enough, ma'am.

16:48.014 --> 16:52.101
Ladies, safety is number one
on the job site.

16:52.185 --> 16:56.606
And safety comes with confidence
and comfort using tools and equipment.

16:56.690 --> 17:00.777
Confidence and comfort
come from practice and common sense.

17:00.860 --> 17:04.238
I will be your guide and supervisor
as we erect this structure.

17:04.321 --> 17:05.781
He said "erect."

17:05.865 --> 17:07.491
What exactly is this structure?

17:07.576 --> 17:10.036
From the plans I've been given,
it's a giant cube with a roof.

17:11.037 --> 17:14.915
Now, anyone here have
any carpentry or construction experience?

17:14.999 --> 17:16.000
Show of hands?

17:21.089 --> 17:22.882
-I need an apprentice.
-[inmates] Oh, here!

17:27.220 --> 17:28.763
I love your enthusiasm, ladies.

17:28.847 --> 17:32.058
[Piscatella] Let's wait to choose
an apprentice 'til we see who earns it.

17:32.141 --> 17:36.312
Inmates, give us a minute
while we figure out your work assignments.

17:38.147 --> 17:40.316
If we're gonna make anything off of this,

17:40.399 --> 17:42.318
we gotta get that paparazzi pizza dough.

17:42.401 --> 17:43.737
You got to get the phone charged.

17:43.820 --> 17:45.363
Juice up the box.

17:45.446 --> 17:47.031
Juice up the box?

17:47.115 --> 17:48.783
Like a juice box.

17:50.493 --> 17:53.121
Only the juice is electricity
and the box is the--

17:54.581 --> 17:57.709
You called money
"paparazzi pizza dough."

17:58.793 --> 18:02.088
-Okay, fine.
-I'll give you half a point for effort.

18:03.131 --> 18:05.133
Hell, no, you ain't.
This ain't no participation trophy.

18:05.216 --> 18:07.093
Look, that's what's wrong
with this country.

18:07.176 --> 18:09.929
You either score or you miss.

18:10.013 --> 18:12.807
-[backhoe engine stops]
-[backhoe rattling]

18:14.643 --> 18:17.436
God damn it!
We lost the hydraulics!

18:17.520 --> 18:20.982
-Try downshifting!
-[driver] I tried that already.

18:21.065 --> 18:23.192
-Can you fix it?
-I'm not a mechanic.

18:23.276 --> 18:28.489
McDonald, let's put our new trainees
to work while we wait on the fix.

18:28.572 --> 18:31.367
Everyone, grab a shovel
and let's get started.

18:31.450 --> 18:33.369
Uh, shouldn't we finish
going through safety training

18:33.452 --> 18:35.246
-before we get started?
-[Piscatella] You did.

18:35.329 --> 18:38.416
Practice and common sense.
Stay safe.

18:38.499 --> 18:39.793
Let's get to work.

18:42.295 --> 18:43.337
[McDonald] Let's go!

18:43.421 --> 18:45.048
Hard hats, first, please.

18:45.131 --> 18:46.800
How is this educational?

18:46.883 --> 18:51.220
Lesson one, don't do crime
because prison is unpleasant.

18:52.263 --> 18:55.850
Start digging, ladies.
You have a hard hat and a shovel.

19:05.944 --> 19:07.111
Oops!

19:09.072 --> 19:11.825
Silly me.
I'm so clumsy.

19:15.829 --> 19:16.913
Got 'em!

19:18.331 --> 19:20.834
-Let's do this.
-[gasps] What?

19:20.917 --> 19:22.418
Don't hold out on me.

19:23.461 --> 19:24.545
I'm not holdin' nothin'.

19:24.628 --> 19:27.048
But you promised to show me
how to do eye makeup like you do.

19:27.131 --> 19:30.134
[gasps] Oh! That.

19:30.218 --> 19:31.635
Right, yeah, right.

19:32.595 --> 19:34.931
Okay, I've been thinking, though,
you gotta bring your own pencil,

19:35.014 --> 19:37.641
'cause if you use mine, you could get,
like, pinkeye or something.

19:37.726 --> 19:38.977
Do you have pinkeye?

19:39.060 --> 19:40.854
I don't think so,

19:40.937 --> 19:44.065
but I don't know, and you gotta be
really careful around here.

19:44.148 --> 19:46.735
Okay, so listen,
you go to the drug store,

19:46.818 --> 19:49.696
you get yourself
a really good black eyeliner pencil

19:49.779 --> 19:51.030
and then I'll show you everything.

19:51.114 --> 19:53.783
And it doesn't even
have to be expensive, neither.

19:53.867 --> 19:56.619
Maybe pick up a mascara, too.
Uh, the pink one.

19:57.787 --> 19:59.956
And then we'll do
a whole lesson, okay? [chuckles]

20:00.039 --> 20:02.166
-Yeah, okay. [chuckles]
-Okay.

20:02.250 --> 20:03.793
Great, I gotta go.
I'm gonna think about ways

20:03.877 --> 20:07.171
on how to make your eyes really pop
and make you really cute.

20:24.022 --> 20:25.273
Mmm-mmm!

20:26.190 --> 20:27.233
Man.

20:28.151 --> 20:29.778
You know, I don't know
what your secret is, Specs,

20:29.861 --> 20:32.155
but you are looking
even hotter than I remember.

20:32.238 --> 20:34.323
-Suck it, Nichols.
-Come on.

20:34.407 --> 20:35.784
You're single.
I'm single.

20:35.867 --> 20:37.994
The birds are singing.
The grass is soft.

20:38.077 --> 20:40.830
The grass is covered
in off-brand weed killer.

20:41.580 --> 20:43.249
Pretty please?
Okay?

20:43.332 --> 20:46.044
I just spent 94 days in Max
in an eight-bed cell

20:46.127 --> 20:48.421
with, among others,
two random shriekers

20:48.504 --> 20:50.673
and a woman who put her baby
through a dryer cycle.

20:50.757 --> 20:52.550
Oh, that is sexy.

20:52.633 --> 20:54.761
Oh!
Oh, that's nothing.

20:54.844 --> 20:56.679
I learned to shit in front of an audience.

20:56.763 --> 20:58.639
Yeah, of course what you're flushing

20:58.722 --> 21:01.976
is mainly just whatever's left
of your humanity. So...

21:02.060 --> 21:04.062
Yeah, well, it's not like
it's been a fun-fest over here.

21:04.145 --> 21:05.354
Fuck you, Vause.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.190
This place is like a camp.

21:07.273 --> 21:09.067
[stuttering] What happened?

21:09.150 --> 21:11.069
The commissary run out of chocolate chips?

21:11.152 --> 21:13.487
It's been a shitty
couple of months, Nicky.

21:13.571 --> 21:15.865
You're not the only one
that has rough times.

21:21.579 --> 21:23.832
Okay, new plan.

21:24.833 --> 21:28.962
You and me go on
a magic carpet ride to happy town.

21:29.045 --> 21:30.797
Jesus, you've got a one-track mind.

21:30.880 --> 21:34.175
[chuckles] For your information,
I have a two-track mind.

21:34.258 --> 21:36.260
<i>All right,
come join me on track deux.</i>

21:36.344 --> 21:37.595
Look...

21:37.678 --> 21:39.472
you can even keep your clothes on.

21:40.139 --> 21:41.765
Oh, of course, you know,

21:41.850 --> 21:44.477
if you don't need a vacation
from your reality, then, uh...

21:44.560 --> 21:46.395
hey, by all means, decline.

21:56.322 --> 21:58.324
[inmates talking indistinctly]

22:04.247 --> 22:06.165
Hey, smells good.

22:06.249 --> 22:08.417
You leave that stuff in the place?

22:08.501 --> 22:10.044
I need to talk to you about that.

22:10.128 --> 22:11.545
Why?
Something went wrong?

22:11.629 --> 22:13.006
No, no, no, no.
No, it was fine.

22:13.089 --> 22:15.842
-I mean... sorry. I left it.
-[microwave beeping]

22:15.925 --> 22:17.010
It's all fine.

22:22.932 --> 22:24.267
[sighs]

22:30.856 --> 22:34.068
Ooh, you got the shrimp flavor.
That's a good one.

22:34.986 --> 22:37.530
I haven't been...
eating so good lately

22:37.613 --> 22:39.407
'cause I'm so nervous all the time.

22:39.490 --> 22:40.616
Have you tried meditating?

22:40.699 --> 22:42.785
Maria, I need to stop.

22:43.702 --> 22:45.288
I almost got caught today.

22:45.955 --> 22:48.582
I think the key word there is "almost."

22:49.583 --> 22:50.876
Almost don't count.

22:51.794 --> 22:54.672
So, you're gonna calm yourself,

22:54.755 --> 22:57.383
and you're going to keep doing
what you're doing.

22:57.466 --> 22:58.842
And if I don't want to?

23:00.303 --> 23:01.595
Ain't about want.

23:03.973 --> 23:05.474
[sighs]

23:14.775 --> 23:17.028
-[male officer] Keep going!
-[inmates grunting]

23:30.249 --> 23:32.335
Hey, Boo! Are you thirsty?

23:32.418 --> 23:34.378
[Big Boo] Oh, fuck, yeah!

23:34.462 --> 23:37.048
What, is this some kind of
lesbian superpower

23:37.131 --> 23:39.758
that you can fix machines like this,
like a man?

23:39.842 --> 23:42.345
[chuckles] Are you kidding?

23:42.428 --> 23:44.555
-Oh!
-[chuckles]

23:45.306 --> 23:46.349
Ah.

23:47.516 --> 23:50.103
-I got no fucking clue what I'm doing.
-You don't?

23:50.186 --> 23:52.146
I figure if I loosen and tighten
the bolt repeatedly,

23:52.230 --> 23:54.815
it eats up the whole fucking day
and keeps me out of the trenches.

23:54.898 --> 23:56.359
That's... that's pretty smart.

23:56.442 --> 23:58.736
Now, scram, girl.
You're blowing my cover.

23:58.819 --> 24:01.364
Oh, no, no, no.
It's totally cool.

24:01.447 --> 24:04.117
They assigned me to learn from you,

24:04.200 --> 24:07.620
just in case if anything breaks,
somebody else knows how to fix it.

24:08.621 --> 24:12.041
'Cause, like, what if you get let out...
or you're busy?

24:13.209 --> 24:14.543
How do you like them apples?

24:14.627 --> 24:16.587
<i>All About Eve, huh?</i>

24:16.670 --> 24:17.921
Yeah, yeah.

24:18.006 --> 24:21.009
'Cause Adam... Adam told her
not to eat that apple.

24:21.092 --> 24:24.928
And she ate it, she became wise.
Just like me.

24:26.930 --> 24:28.391
Yeah.
Tell you what.

24:28.474 --> 24:30.893
Come on under here,
I'll show you what we're doing.

24:39.110 --> 24:40.319
Keep working, inmate.

24:44.698 --> 24:47.326
Oh, Jesus, you cutting yourself now?

24:48.077 --> 24:49.745
I thought I was the emo one.

24:49.828 --> 24:52.040
-What?
-You're bleeding.

24:53.749 --> 24:55.000
Fuck.

24:55.084 --> 24:58.879
I used to cut myself.
But in, like, cool designs.

24:59.922 --> 25:02.091
She should cut herself.

25:02.175 --> 25:03.842
We're all out of work because of her.

25:03.926 --> 25:05.678
[Blake] If you can't dig
and talk at the same time,

25:05.761 --> 25:07.180
then you dig and shut up.

25:07.263 --> 25:10.058
Shovels in the dirt.
Now!

25:19.525 --> 25:21.485
And don't touch 'em for a half an hour.

25:21.569 --> 25:24.447
I'm not doing free fixing
'cause you were a moron

25:24.530 --> 25:26.324
and felt like seeing if they were dry.

25:26.407 --> 25:30.244
Okay, I said it was a mistake.
Some lint got stuck to it.

25:30.328 --> 25:31.912
<i>Pa' fuera.</i>

25:38.502 --> 25:40.088
Got time for a walk-in?

25:41.672 --> 25:43.006
Don't expect a family discount.

25:51.932 --> 25:53.267
You been chewing on these again?

25:53.351 --> 25:55.186
Some of us got a lot on our minds.

25:55.269 --> 25:57.271
You don't think I got a lot on my mind?

25:57.355 --> 26:00.566
I gotta figure out a place
to set up the salon out there.

26:00.649 --> 26:03.152
I gotta hire girls to help me.

26:03.236 --> 26:05.238
Maybe a receptionist with great nails

26:05.321 --> 26:07.656
so that everyone can see the work
right when they walk in.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.617
What the fuck are you talking about?

26:09.700 --> 26:11.369
I'm talkin' about my future.

26:11.452 --> 26:13.704
You gotta get your cosmetology license.

26:15.206 --> 26:16.499
You gotta rent a place.

26:16.582 --> 26:18.209
Fill it with chairs and foot buckets

26:18.292 --> 26:20.711
and get the machine
that kills the germs on the tools.

26:20.794 --> 26:22.296
Where you gonna get money
for all that?

26:22.380 --> 26:24.548
You lucky if you could afford
a few bottles of polish.

26:25.924 --> 26:27.718
Got a lot on your mind.

26:27.801 --> 26:29.845
[scoffs] Got some nerve.

26:31.389 --> 26:33.307
You got make-believe on your mind.

26:42.191 --> 26:43.609
You know, maybe you can...

26:45.653 --> 26:47.905
start in someone else's place.

26:47.988 --> 26:50.241
Learn the business
and take over that shit.

26:52.535 --> 26:54.036
You'll run it in no time.

26:56.997 --> 26:58.707
You're like that bug
that takes over the other bug

26:58.791 --> 27:00.501
and controls it and everything.

27:02.211 --> 27:04.713
And you're really good
at figuring out business stuff, so...

27:06.840 --> 27:08.050
What color you want?

27:13.389 --> 27:14.598
[sighs]

27:18.269 --> 27:22.565
Oh, CO Bayley, I asked you politely
to please wait outside.

27:22.648 --> 27:23.899
Miss Washington is a friend.

27:23.982 --> 27:26.819
Right, but I'm your shadow, you know.

27:26.902 --> 27:30.030
[imitating The Shadow] Who knows
what evil lurks in the hearts of man?

27:30.113 --> 27:32.491
The Shadow knows! [cackling]

27:35.869 --> 27:38.372
Been listening to a retro radio podcast.

27:39.457 --> 27:40.541
Podcast?
No, okay.

27:41.584 --> 27:43.711
All right.
I'll, uh, I'll wait outside.

27:43.794 --> 27:46.464
<i>Ooh, The Wise Man's Fear.</i>

27:46.547 --> 27:49.758
<i>I loved The Name of the Wind.
Can I, uh... Can I borrow that?</i>

27:49.842 --> 27:51.176
Knock yourself out.

27:57.099 --> 27:58.226
What's goin' on with that?

27:58.309 --> 27:59.477
-[door closes]
-[chuckles]

28:00.394 --> 28:03.397
I... I've been assigned protection
and it's driving me bananas.

28:03.481 --> 28:07.485
Now... I know your friends
are frustrated with me,

28:07.568 --> 28:10.488
but surely we can find some way
to work that out.

28:10.571 --> 28:12.865
Wait. Wait, wait.

28:12.948 --> 28:14.950
You think the black girls
are gonna jump you?

28:15.033 --> 28:18.662
Well, uh, the crazy one has been
taunting me with songs from the show.

28:18.746 --> 28:20.539
And the big one with the puffy hair,

28:20.623 --> 28:23.667
she cornered me in the hallway
with the... gal with the head wrap.

28:23.751 --> 28:24.960
I didn't make that up.

28:25.043 --> 28:27.963
[sighs] It's not like you wouldn't
deserve it after that chitlin' mess.

28:29.257 --> 28:30.466
[sighs]

28:33.344 --> 28:34.553
They were puppets.

28:34.637 --> 28:36.972
Yeah, puppets that reinforce stereotypes

28:37.055 --> 28:39.642
that black people
are dumb and superstitious.

28:39.725 --> 28:43.479
They steal and they love
being indentured servants.

28:43.562 --> 28:46.023
And don't get me started
on the cannibalism.

28:46.106 --> 28:47.566
I gotta tell you,
it's disappointing.

28:47.650 --> 28:50.944
All right, look,
I sincerely regret it.

28:51.028 --> 28:53.906
But they did promote fresh food.
I mean, there was a message.

28:55.157 --> 28:56.867
Oh, all right.

28:56.950 --> 28:59.077
Listen, I'm gonna tell you the truth.

28:59.161 --> 29:01.539
I did a lot of blow back
in the early '80s,

29:01.622 --> 29:04.250
and it kept me thin and awake,

29:04.333 --> 29:06.168
but it didn't do much
for my cultural sensitivity,

29:06.252 --> 29:09.338
or my bank account,
or my gynecological health.

29:09.422 --> 29:12.591
Now, the chips fell,
I eventually moved on.

29:12.675 --> 29:14.343
And here I am.

29:16.011 --> 29:18.055
But it can get lonely, you know?

29:18.138 --> 29:20.558
I'm... I'm trying to put
a brave face on it,

29:20.641 --> 29:23.977
but to tell you the truth,
I could use some friends.

29:24.061 --> 29:27.356
Other than a skinny hippie
always in crisis.

29:28.357 --> 29:29.733
You know,
it's hard enough being in here

29:29.817 --> 29:31.735
without feelin' everybody hates me.

29:35.739 --> 29:39.327
It ever occur to you
that it's racist to assume

29:39.410 --> 29:42.371
that black people are gonna
beat you up for bein' racist?

29:42.455 --> 29:45.874
And you have a good point there.
Right, all right, look,

29:45.958 --> 29:47.626
I'm tryin'.

29:47.710 --> 29:50.170
I mean, maybe I am a racist.
Maybe I'm just too stupid to know it,

29:50.253 --> 29:54.300
but shit, I am the friendliest racist
that you are ever gonna meet,

29:54.383 --> 29:57.260
-so can't we all just get along?
-[scoffs]

30:00.138 --> 30:01.181
[sighs]

30:01.264 --> 30:04.727
All right. All right, I'll talk to 'em.
See what's up.

30:04.810 --> 30:07.438
Great, thank you. Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

30:07.521 --> 30:09.315
You are one of the good ones.

30:11.525 --> 30:15.028
No, I meant that as in people in general.

30:15.112 --> 30:16.238
Just...

30:16.322 --> 30:17.531
Shh.

30:34.297 --> 30:35.758
[Nicky giggling]

30:37.300 --> 30:38.969
[Nicky] She saw me!

30:39.052 --> 30:40.388
Nicky?

30:43.849 --> 30:44.892
Nicky?

30:50.939 --> 30:52.315
-[Nicky yells]
-[both laughing]

30:52.400 --> 30:53.734
What are you doing?

30:53.817 --> 30:55.653
Hey, Bummer Chapman,

30:55.736 --> 30:58.697
[chuckling] get the fuck down
or fuck the fuck off.

30:58.781 --> 31:00.616
[sing-song] Bum, bum-bum, bum, bummer.

31:00.699 --> 31:02.368
My tongue feels delightful.

31:02.451 --> 31:04.077
-[Nicky] Hey!
-[laughing]

31:04.161 --> 31:05.245
[Piper] Ow!

31:05.328 --> 31:06.329
Argh!

31:07.498 --> 31:08.541
Shit!

31:08.624 --> 31:11.419
Psst! You know,
from this angle,

31:11.502 --> 31:13.671
your nose hairs are pretty prominent, no?

31:13.754 --> 31:14.797
-Oh, my God.
-Look at that.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.757
-Well, she used to trim them.
-[Piper sighs]

31:16.840 --> 31:19.009
You are really letting yourself go,
Chapman.

31:19.092 --> 31:21.470
Are you two crazy?
What the fuck are you doing?

31:21.554 --> 31:23.346
[Nicky] It's a weekly meeting, okay,

31:23.431 --> 31:26.016
for the morally morose
and successfully challenged.

31:26.099 --> 31:27.184
So we're just going back and forth

31:27.267 --> 31:30.228
and, uh, talking about
all the truly dreadful, horrible shit

31:30.312 --> 31:32.314
that we have to slog through
on a daily basis--

31:32.398 --> 31:34.775
-And we're smoking crack.
-Oh, yeah! That, too. [clears throat]

31:34.858 --> 31:36.569
Are you two fucking serious?

31:36.652 --> 31:38.571
While not my first choice,

31:38.654 --> 31:40.698
crack in small amounts
is actually good for you.

31:40.781 --> 31:42.825
It's gotten a bad rap over the years.
I don't even...

31:42.908 --> 31:44.284
-[inhales sharply]
-Yeah, yeah.

31:44.367 --> 31:46.328
Drug beggars
can't be drug choosers, you know.

31:46.412 --> 31:49.998
Perfect. So you guys
are cracked out of your minds.

31:50.082 --> 31:51.166
Hmm.

31:52.751 --> 31:53.794
[Nicky inhales] Ah!

31:53.877 --> 31:54.962
[exhales heavily]

31:56.213 --> 31:57.465
[sighs]

31:58.215 --> 31:59.758
And you can be, too.
Here.

32:00.426 --> 32:02.720
Uh, full disclosure,
that crack's been up someone's ass.

32:02.803 --> 32:04.972
-Probably Angie's.
-Oh, definitely Angie's.

32:05.055 --> 32:08.058
Yeah, I traded her a lipstick for it.
[sniffs]

32:08.141 --> 32:10.519
[Alex] Here you go.
[Nicky] And don't worry, Piper.

32:10.603 --> 32:13.606
It's sterilized by the flame.

32:15.107 --> 32:16.859
[giggling]

32:16.942 --> 32:18.360
[breathes heavily]

32:21.905 --> 32:23.365
Fuck it.

32:24.282 --> 32:26.994
Whoa! Seriously?

32:27.077 --> 32:28.286
Why would you offer it to me,

32:28.370 --> 32:30.038
if you weren't actually
gonna share it with me?

32:31.331 --> 32:34.417
[stammering] No, I'm just... surprised.

32:34.502 --> 32:35.919
Well, don't be.

32:38.797 --> 32:40.090
Hand it over.

32:44.720 --> 32:46.221
Okay, so, what do I do?

32:46.304 --> 32:49.850
Now breathe in.
Real deep.

32:51.393 --> 32:52.645
[inhales deeply]

32:58.609 --> 33:00.778
[Nicky] Real deep, hold it!

33:08.994 --> 33:10.287
[exhales]

33:15.000 --> 33:16.168
Wow.

33:17.545 --> 33:18.629
Wow.

33:18.712 --> 33:19.963
Take it easy. [chuckles]

33:20.047 --> 33:22.716
Take it easy? Fuck that!
I was branded, okay?

33:28.681 --> 33:30.432
Man, I did not see that coming.

33:30.516 --> 33:31.600
Holy shit!

33:32.518 --> 33:33.686
You're a Nazi now?

33:33.769 --> 33:35.437
Not a Nazi.
I think I'm a Nazi sympathizer.

33:35.521 --> 33:36.897
I think that was the message.

33:36.980 --> 33:38.106
I brought this on myself.

33:38.190 --> 33:39.775
This is what I've become.
This is what I've become.

33:39.858 --> 33:42.485
This is what I've fucking become,
you guys.

33:42.570 --> 33:43.821
How do I come back from this?

33:43.904 --> 33:45.781
I sent Stella down the hill.
Why did I have to do that?

33:45.864 --> 33:47.115
She stole your money.

33:48.075 --> 33:49.743
I was acquainted with her in Max.

33:49.827 --> 33:51.704
My parents didn't teach me
to be like this.

33:54.081 --> 33:55.958
What I did to Maria...

33:56.041 --> 33:57.835
I didn't feel bad.

33:57.918 --> 33:59.086
I didn't think twice.

33:59.169 --> 34:00.170
I just...

34:01.338 --> 34:02.590
went too far.

34:04.382 --> 34:05.634
I always go too far.

34:10.347 --> 34:12.474
I always go too fucking far.

34:16.018 --> 34:18.146
And I can't fucking stop it.

34:18.230 --> 34:19.982
You're not the worst person
in here, Piper.

34:21.483 --> 34:24.235
I think that I've been trying
to win prison.

34:27.947 --> 34:30.158
And I've destroyed people's lives.

34:31.118 --> 34:33.161
[sighs] Gimme that shit again.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.038
-Yeah.
-Gimme that.

34:35.121 --> 34:36.289
[clears throat]

34:36.373 --> 34:37.540
[inhales deeply]

34:51.304 --> 34:53.348
I killed someone.

34:55.308 --> 34:58.103
[laughing]
Fuck, man.

34:58.186 --> 34:59.312
[chuckles]

34:59.396 --> 35:01.649
[chuckles] What, by accident?

35:02.482 --> 35:04.985
No. No, I killed him.

35:06.695 --> 35:07.780
On purpose.

35:08.906 --> 35:10.532
[laughing] Fuck...

35:10.616 --> 35:13.243
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

35:13.326 --> 35:15.495
What? How?

35:15.578 --> 35:17.956
That's impossible.
You couldn't do that. I know you.

35:18.040 --> 35:21.919
Last month.
Kubra sent someone in here to kill me.

35:23.045 --> 35:24.672
Like I said he would.

35:26.339 --> 35:28.050
I mean, in here?

35:29.384 --> 35:32.220
-Fuckin' A.
-How?

35:32.304 --> 35:33.931
Alex, what did you do with the body?

35:34.014 --> 35:35.557
[chuckles]

35:37.059 --> 35:38.852
You're sitting on him.

35:41.647 --> 35:45.025
Parts of him.
I mean, he's all over. [sobbing]

35:48.111 --> 35:49.446
Oh, God.

35:51.364 --> 35:53.200
[sobbing] Stop.

35:58.831 --> 36:02.793
Look, just because
I sit behind a desk all day

36:02.876 --> 36:05.713
does not mean
your job is harder than mine.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.341
As a matter of fact, it does.

36:09.424 --> 36:13.053
You dig a hole for four hours
and tell us if your job is harder.

36:13.136 --> 36:18.475
Do you know how complicated phones
have gotten since we've been inside?

36:18.558 --> 36:20.185
As complicated
as findin' chargers for them?

36:20.268 --> 36:22.771
[Taystee] I'm tryin'.
Caputo's got a different brand going on.

36:22.855 --> 36:25.691
There go my girl.
P, please tell these bitches

36:25.774 --> 36:28.944
that my job
is just as hard as diggin' a ditch.

36:29.027 --> 36:30.988
-It's not.
-[both] Ah!

36:32.572 --> 36:35.951
Look, why y'all trying
to beat up Judy King?

36:36.034 --> 36:37.077
Because she racist.

36:37.160 --> 36:39.788
Why would we beat up an old white lady?

36:39.872 --> 36:41.331
[scoffs] One pop and she down.

36:41.414 --> 36:43.000
And it would ruin the photo.

36:43.083 --> 36:45.002
Ain't nobody trying
to beat down Judy King.

36:45.085 --> 36:46.795
-Who told you that?
-She did.

36:46.879 --> 36:48.630
She told me y'all chased her
down the hallway

36:48.714 --> 36:51.049
and Crazy Eyes
was singing like a murder doll.

36:51.133 --> 36:52.384
Wait, what photo?
What are you--

36:52.467 --> 36:53.927
We're trying to get a picture.

36:55.053 --> 36:57.514
-A picture of what?
-Of Judy King.

36:57.597 --> 36:59.557
That's it?

36:59.641 --> 37:01.810
-Just a picture?
-Just a picture.

37:05.647 --> 37:08.441
-[inmates grunt]
-[indistinct chatter]

37:19.661 --> 37:21.079
[sighs]

37:22.289 --> 37:25.751
Chapman? Wow.
You look even worse than this morning.

37:25.834 --> 37:27.795
Are you sure
you don't wanna go to medical?

37:27.878 --> 37:30.213
No, this crash...

37:30.297 --> 37:31.631
is bad.

37:31.714 --> 37:35.093
Just processing a lot of stuff right now.

37:35.177 --> 37:38.721
Ooh. Did you have diarrhea?
You need to stay hydrated.

37:45.645 --> 37:49.566
I wanna say, you're all doing a great job.
Keep it up.

37:49.649 --> 37:52.069
Bet you don't have that problem.

37:52.152 --> 37:53.821
-[inmates laugh]
-Right.

37:53.904 --> 37:55.989
You hear there's a time machine
in laundry?

37:56.073 --> 37:58.450
Oh, yeah, and there's a fountain of youth
in the ghetto toilet.

37:59.409 --> 38:01.161
[McDonald] Yeah, blue helmet.

38:01.244 --> 38:02.579
Do any y'all want water?

38:02.662 --> 38:05.457
You know, if that shit was true,
I'd go back and see my dead mom.

38:05.540 --> 38:07.459
Tell her not to date
the guy that killed her.

38:07.542 --> 38:10.462
I'd go back and not end up
in this fucking place.

38:10.545 --> 38:14.424
Y'all ever think about, like,
going back and killing Hitler?

38:14.507 --> 38:16.634
Or maybe I'd go back,
raise Hitler right.

38:16.718 --> 38:20.347
You know, give him lots of love
and encourage his artistic side,

38:20.430 --> 38:22.557
try to be a good mom figure to him.

38:22.640 --> 38:24.935
Maybe he'd have less anger issues.

38:26.519 --> 38:29.439
I'd go back and tell him
to seize the Suez Canal early on.

38:29.522 --> 38:31.274
That'd secure
most of the Mediterranean,

38:31.358 --> 38:34.236
giving the Third Reich easy access to oil.

38:38.490 --> 38:41.118
[inmate 1]
I can't. They need it over here.

38:41.201 --> 38:43.203
[inmate 2 grunts]

38:44.955 --> 38:47.707
Where would you go,
back in time?

38:47.790 --> 38:49.334
-Me?
-Yeah.

38:49.417 --> 38:51.628
Uh... well, summer of '99,

38:51.711 --> 38:54.756
I was supposed to see Judas Priest
at, uh, Ralph Wilson Stadium,

38:54.840 --> 38:57.009
but my friend, Champ Silvers,

38:57.092 --> 39:00.553
he challenged me to drink
a dirty 30 pack in the parking lot.

39:00.637 --> 39:01.679
Of Coors Light.

39:01.763 --> 39:03.265
And, uh, I puked everywhere.

39:03.348 --> 39:05.558
I never even got in to see
Rob Halford on stage.

39:06.476 --> 39:08.770
-Regrets, you know?
-Yeah.

39:11.273 --> 39:13.441
[Piscatella] Put some tape on it.
It's all right.

39:13.525 --> 39:15.152
-[both moaning]
-[Franny] I'm telling you, Lorna,

39:15.235 --> 39:17.029
if I would have known
Jack was gonna try something,

39:17.112 --> 39:18.613
I would've locked the door.

39:18.696 --> 39:20.323
The kid's got unusual sleep patterns.

39:20.407 --> 39:22.742
I look up, the doors open
and there's Tommy.

39:22.825 --> 39:24.702
And his eyes are going, "What?"

39:24.786 --> 39:26.955
And he makes a noise, "Oh."

39:27.039 --> 39:28.665
[chuckles] Oh, my goodness.

39:28.748 --> 39:30.458
And you and Jack,
you just kept going?

39:30.542 --> 39:31.960
Oh, yeah, basically.

39:32.044 --> 39:35.255
I said, "Tommy, go back to your room,
your mommy and daddy are making love."

39:35.338 --> 39:36.548
[laughs]

39:36.631 --> 39:39.384
Well, I guess at that age,
he doesn't know what that means.

39:39.467 --> 39:41.344
I hardly know what it means at my age.

39:41.428 --> 39:43.763
Jack and I are like ships in the night.

39:43.846 --> 39:46.391
That's why I didn't stop
when I saw the kid there.

39:46.474 --> 39:49.937
Yeah, well, Vinny and I
just had the honeymoon, so...

39:50.020 --> 39:51.939
You know what Tommy said last week?

39:52.022 --> 39:53.731
He says, "I'm never getting married."

39:53.815 --> 39:55.525
I said, "Well, never's a long time."

39:55.608 --> 39:59.279
He says, "I don't want some girl
spending all my money."

39:59.362 --> 40:00.948
He don't get that mouth from me.

40:04.076 --> 40:07.412
Franny, I...
I think Vinny's cheating on me.

40:07.495 --> 40:10.958
Oh, Lorn, you don't know that.

40:11.041 --> 40:13.961
From what you told me,
he don't sound like the type.

40:14.044 --> 40:18.465
He hasn't visited in weeks.
We barely even talk on the phone.

40:18.548 --> 40:20.675
Honey, you're letting your mind
run away with you.

40:20.758 --> 40:22.552
I'm sure it's nothing.
You gotta trust.

40:22.635 --> 40:24.930
-I gotta know.
-Then you gotta ask.

40:25.013 --> 40:27.057
What if I don't believe him?
I can't live with that.

40:27.140 --> 40:28.725
That's marriage.

40:28.808 --> 40:32.312
You think I don't wonder where Jack's been
when he comes home after 11:00

40:32.395 --> 40:33.730
and says he's been "bowling"?

40:33.813 --> 40:36.399
You get to see Jack every day.

40:36.984 --> 40:38.026
[sighs]

40:38.110 --> 40:41.863
Honey, will you just go...
visit him for me?

40:41.947 --> 40:44.574
-What, like, at his house?
-Mmm-hmm.

40:44.657 --> 40:46.784
What good will that do?

40:46.868 --> 40:50.413
Lorna, this is the kinda garbage
that got you in here.

40:50.497 --> 40:53.875
[voice breaking] No, no.
He is family.

40:53.959 --> 40:55.210
And I don't mean like that.

40:55.293 --> 40:57.254
I... I mean,

40:57.337 --> 40:58.964
I mean, just get to know him a little.

40:59.047 --> 41:02.217
-He's your brother, for Christ's sake!
-[groans]

41:02.300 --> 41:05.095
Please, I'm begging you!
You know I would do this for you.

41:05.178 --> 41:07.305
I would do this for you!

41:07.389 --> 41:11.184
I just can't live thinking that he's using
some other housewife's oven mitt.

41:13.728 --> 41:14.896
-[crying]
-All right.

41:16.564 --> 41:18.608
[chuckles] I'll go to his house.

41:18.691 --> 41:22.195
Thank you so much.
I love you, my sister.

41:22.279 --> 41:23.530
I love you.

41:30.287 --> 41:31.496
Uh... [clears throat]

41:34.457 --> 41:36.668
-You got an appointment?
-[Nicky] Uh-uh.

41:36.751 --> 41:38.003
Walk-in.

41:39.129 --> 41:41.923
-Is that okay?
-That depends.

41:56.229 --> 41:57.397
Take a seat.

42:04.112 --> 42:06.073
That's a lot of hair.

42:06.156 --> 42:09.284
Are we really playing
Barbie Styling Head here? [stutters]

42:09.367 --> 42:11.619
You know, I got places to be. So...

42:12.620 --> 42:13.996
Updo it is.

42:15.748 --> 42:18.876
Ow. Yeah, that's nice.
You really know what you're doing, huh?

42:18.960 --> 42:20.878
Fabulous.

42:20.962 --> 42:24.716
Yeah...
I'm like a real Audrey Hepburn, huh?

42:26.008 --> 42:27.469
Thank you.

42:33.308 --> 42:35.017
Can you do that somewhere else?

42:38.480 --> 42:40.440
You can paint nails anywhere.

42:40.523 --> 42:42.192
Of course.

42:42.275 --> 42:44.277
I finally find a job I'm good at.

42:44.361 --> 42:45.820
Turns out to be a drug front.

42:48.615 --> 42:51.118
I got two days left in this shithole.

42:51.201 --> 42:52.577
I can't screw it up.

42:54.412 --> 42:56.539
Then don't screw it up.

42:59.209 --> 43:00.335
[scoffs]

43:10.470 --> 43:12.514
[inmates talking indistinctly]

43:21.063 --> 43:22.815
How's everything looking here?

43:22.899 --> 43:24.817
Oh, you mean this? [scoffs]

43:24.901 --> 43:27.112
-She's totally fucking dead.
-Oh, yeah?

43:27.195 --> 43:29.322
I mean, I can't get her to start at all.

43:29.406 --> 43:31.073
-You wanna give it a shot?
-Yeah.

43:31.158 --> 43:32.450
All right.

43:35.495 --> 43:37.622
-Whoa!
-[grunting] Here you go, man.

43:42.169 --> 43:44.962
Well, first off, you needed
to have it in neutral to restart it.

43:45.046 --> 43:47.215
-Uh-huh.
-It looks like it just overheated.

43:47.299 --> 43:49.759
-I see.
-Yeah, should work fine now.

43:49.842 --> 43:51.469
So if it conks out,
let it cool,

43:51.553 --> 43:54.389
put it in neutral, restart it.
Easy fix.

43:54.472 --> 43:56.891
Huh! Listen, um...

43:58.226 --> 44:00.061
if anyone should ask,

44:00.145 --> 44:02.814
could you make it sound
way more complicated than that?

44:04.857 --> 44:06.151
[engine starts]

44:24.711 --> 44:26.338
[inmates talking indistinctly]

44:28.005 --> 44:31.301
Man, oh, man, I'm gonna be
so fucking sore tomorrow. [sucks teeth]

44:31.384 --> 44:33.261
I gotta start exercising.

44:33.345 --> 44:36.639
Man, did you see how fast
that thing took dirt out a hole?

44:36.723 --> 44:39.476
-I know.
-Like, whoosh.

44:39.559 --> 44:43.355
Man, I feel like an autoworker
in Detroit after the robots came.

44:43.438 --> 44:46.524
Like, "Oh, shit, I'm an autoworker
and now I'm out of a job"?

44:46.608 --> 44:47.900
Or like, "Yay!
The robots are here

44:47.984 --> 44:51.238
to do this shitty, horrible
autoworker work. Thank God"?

44:51.321 --> 44:52.739
[Black Cindy] Hmm...

44:54.824 --> 44:57.494
Uh, why is she running at me like that?

44:58.745 --> 45:00.580
[grunting]

45:02.206 --> 45:04.834
[blabbering] Ah!
What the fuck was that for?

45:05.668 --> 45:09.005
-That was dope.
-Did you get it? Let me see.

45:09.088 --> 45:10.715
Damn, she taste like strawberry.

45:10.798 --> 45:12.259
Okay. Yeah, come on.

45:12.342 --> 45:14.218
All right, the second one is a winner.
Don't you think?

45:14.302 --> 45:16.095
-Huh? What?
-[Judy] Look, what do you think?

45:16.178 --> 45:19.140
Interracial lesbian love
behind bars, okay.

45:19.223 --> 45:21.976
We're gonna hold out
for the big bucks, ladies, you know?

45:22.059 --> 45:24.061
Make the rags fight over it.

45:24.145 --> 45:25.647
All right, you did so good.

45:25.730 --> 45:28.316
My mamma gonna see me
kissing a white woman.

45:44.040 --> 45:46.376
What? I'm a mammal.

45:47.710 --> 45:50.588
[sighs] But maybe you're right,
I should shave this shit.

45:51.673 --> 45:53.591
It's like my hormones are out of whack.

45:53.675 --> 45:54.926
Where did you get that?

45:55.009 --> 45:56.218
Commissary.

45:56.303 --> 45:58.846
They haven't sold those since '92.

45:58.930 --> 46:00.473
Tell me where it came from.

46:00.557 --> 46:03.351
I got it in the salon.
On trade.

46:04.561 --> 46:07.229
I was not aware the salon
was back up and running.

46:07.314 --> 46:10.400
Oh, yeah.
Updos, downdos.

46:10.483 --> 46:11.984
[chuckles] We got any 'do you wanna do.

46:12.068 --> 46:13.653
[chuckles] I can see.

46:13.736 --> 46:16.280
Vidal Sassoon's got nothing on you.

46:17.365 --> 46:18.575
Business is business.

46:25.707 --> 46:27.875
Stop giving me the side-eye.

46:29.711 --> 46:31.713
I know how it got there.

47:05.455 --> 47:06.498
[sighs]

47:06.581 --> 47:09.876
Life is so tough
you can't make it into your own bunk?

47:09.959 --> 47:11.419
I don't feel good.

47:14.338 --> 47:17.759
[whispering] I heard that Alex told you
how our garden grows.

47:17.842 --> 47:20.887
If you say a word, I'll end you.

47:20.970 --> 47:24.015
I would... never.

47:24.098 --> 47:25.642
[sniffs]

47:25.725 --> 47:27.519
I just can't...

47:28.436 --> 47:30.187
I can't believe she did what she did.

47:30.271 --> 47:32.023
It needed to be done.

47:32.106 --> 47:34.442
She told me...

47:34.526 --> 47:36.277
and I didn't listen.

47:37.779 --> 47:39.113
She was all on her own.

47:39.196 --> 47:41.866
Maybe she was,
but now she's not.

47:41.949 --> 47:44.619
I've been helping her.
So has Frieda.

47:44.702 --> 47:47.664
She has friends.
Maybe not you, but other people.

47:47.747 --> 47:51.083
-I should have been there for her.
-You had other things on your mind.

47:51.167 --> 47:53.753
Being a panty kingpin took a lot of work.

47:53.836 --> 47:55.755
If I had known,
I would have done something.

47:55.838 --> 48:00.009
Honey... what she did
was morally defensible.

48:00.092 --> 48:02.845
I think, ultimately,
she will find comfort in that.

48:02.929 --> 48:04.764
It was kill or be killed.

48:05.723 --> 48:09.018
Maybe you should worry about the choices
you've made a little more.

48:09.101 --> 48:10.853
[crying] She's in pain.

48:10.937 --> 48:12.647
We are all in pain.

48:14.231 --> 48:15.900
I miss my mirror.

48:17.777 --> 48:19.278
And you hurt your arm.

48:19.361 --> 48:21.280
Hot plate accident?

48:21.363 --> 48:22.490
Another tattoo?

48:22.574 --> 48:24.992
Don't think I didn't hear
your tossing and turning all night.

48:25.076 --> 48:26.619
It's nothing.

48:27.829 --> 48:29.038
Show me.

48:31.123 --> 48:32.500
[crying]

48:44.804 --> 48:46.097
Who did that to you?

48:46.180 --> 48:49.433
[sighs] Doesn't matter.
It's done.

48:52.228 --> 48:56.816
Well, you can't go around
with that horror.

48:56.899 --> 48:59.360
[sobbing] I probably deserve it.

49:01.488 --> 49:03.197
We all need help.

49:07.201 --> 49:09.704
-[sobbing]
-[shushing]

49:13.541 --> 49:15.918
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

49:22.717 --> 49:25.136
Hey. Hey, there!

49:25.219 --> 49:28.222
We gotta stop
running into each other like this.

49:28.305 --> 49:31.518
Yeah, or you could, uh,
just stop followin' me.

49:34.228 --> 49:37.273
That, uh, that whole Judas Priest thing,
that was a stupid joke.

49:37.982 --> 49:39.066
Oh.

49:39.150 --> 49:41.903
Truth be told, I'd probably
go back to when we first met.

49:42.737 --> 49:45.406
-Okay.
-I would have treated you like a person.

49:45.489 --> 49:49.076
Not like a duck.
Or... a thing.

49:51.996 --> 49:53.915
And I... I...

49:54.957 --> 49:56.208
[sighs]

49:56.292 --> 49:57.544
I would have liked our first time,

49:57.627 --> 50:01.130
if we had gotten there,
to have been... nice.

50:01.213 --> 50:04.175
And I would have wanted to see your face.

50:04.258 --> 50:07.804
And to have told you
what I told you about...

50:07.887 --> 50:10.765
uh, loving you, but softer.

50:10.848 --> 50:13.100
[Pennsatucky clears throat]

50:13.184 --> 50:15.562
I wish I hadn't been so mad.

50:17.980 --> 50:21.609
It wasn't fair what happened and...

50:22.694 --> 50:24.779
So yeah, that's probably
what I'd go back to.

50:24.862 --> 50:27.531
And I'm still trying
to figure out why it happened.

50:27.615 --> 50:29.033
Why...

50:30.159 --> 50:31.786
I did what I did.

50:39.001 --> 50:40.712
I'm sorry, Doggett.

50:48.135 --> 50:51.472
Thank you.
Thank you for saying that.

51:05.653 --> 51:08.615
The backhoe broke down
within the first ten minutes.

51:08.698 --> 51:11.450
<i>Then it turned into a scene
out of Cool Hand Luke,</i>

51:11.533 --> 51:14.578
with the inmates
digging trenches in the sun.

51:14.662 --> 51:16.330
Never seen that movie.

51:19.751 --> 51:21.002
I've let them all down.

51:23.755 --> 51:25.172
Well, you didn't let me down.

51:27.842 --> 51:30.052
-Not now.
-Why not?

51:31.888 --> 51:34.390
[sighs] Because I'm upset.

51:35.349 --> 51:36.684
Is that not obvious?

51:37.810 --> 51:39.145
You know, the school had no chance.

51:39.228 --> 51:41.480
Don't make me feel like
I'm some kind of dream killer.

51:46.152 --> 51:49.155
At least a new dorm
will help with overcrowding.

51:49.238 --> 51:50.948
Might help boost morale a little bit.

51:51.032 --> 51:53.284
Okay.
Good then.

51:54.201 --> 51:58.455
Morale... is... boosted.

51:58.539 --> 51:59.874
[chuckles]

52:01.458 --> 52:03.920
-Or not boosted?
-[knocking on door]

52:04.003 --> 52:05.421
-I'll get that.
-[sighs]

52:05.504 --> 52:07.965
Will you watch the sauce?
Keep stirring.

52:22.313 --> 52:24.190
-Who was it?
-Oh, it was no one.

52:24.273 --> 52:25.858
[doorbell rings]

52:27.318 --> 52:29.570
I'll get it.
I'll get it.

52:29.653 --> 52:31.447
[knocking continues]

52:35.576 --> 52:36.911
-Who the hell is that?
-It's no one.

52:36.994 --> 52:38.412
It's probably just a salesperson.

52:38.495 --> 52:40.414
[Crystal] I hear you, Mr. Caputo.

52:40.497 --> 52:43.710
And don't you even think about
turning that sprinkler back on me again.

52:44.836 --> 52:46.838
Again? How many times
has she been here?

52:46.921 --> 52:48.965
Shh! Keep it down.

52:50.591 --> 52:52.676
-[scoffs]
-Keep it down. Keep it down.

52:52.760 --> 52:56.597
[Crystal] I'm not going anywhere!
I know you're in there!

52:56.680 --> 52:58.640
-Who is that?
-It's Crystal Burset.

52:58.725 --> 53:00.727
Am I supposed to know who that is?

53:00.810 --> 53:03.020
She's married to Sophia Burset,

53:03.104 --> 53:06.107
the inmate you guys made me
put in a four-by-four box.

53:06.190 --> 53:10.652
The human being you won't allow me
to release from inhumane captivity.

53:10.737 --> 53:12.654
Why do you keep saying "you"?

53:12.739 --> 53:14.490
It's not me.
I'm Linda.

53:14.573 --> 53:16.826
I'm here to eat pasta and spend the night.

53:16.909 --> 53:19.871
Can you separate me
from the corporation we both work for?

53:19.954 --> 53:21.163
[sighs]

53:23.124 --> 53:24.583
You're right.

53:25.709 --> 53:28.295
You're right.
I'm sorry.

53:29.338 --> 53:32.341
It's been going on for too long,
and it's starting to get to me.

53:32.424 --> 53:35.136
Hey, hey, you're not MCC.

53:36.220 --> 53:37.596
[doorbell ringing]

53:37.679 --> 53:41.225
[Crystal] Hello?
I know you're in there, Mr. MCC.

53:41.308 --> 53:42.393
All right.
I'm calling the cops.

53:42.476 --> 53:44.228
-Don't do that.
-No, this is ridiculous.

53:44.311 --> 53:46.856
-She's harassing us.
-I will handle it.

53:46.939 --> 53:48.149
[scoffs]

53:51.235 --> 53:52.653
Crystal, it's late.

53:52.736 --> 53:57.658
MCC denied our request
under the Freedom of Information Act.

53:57.741 --> 53:59.076
I need to know what's going on.

53:59.160 --> 54:01.370
Pasta. And I made a salad.

54:01.453 --> 54:03.705
And we've been at work all day.
So, good night.

54:04.415 --> 54:05.875
Everything okay over there?

54:05.958 --> 54:08.585
-Who the hell is that?
-I have no idea.

54:08.669 --> 54:11.005
I told you I will handle this.

54:13.049 --> 54:15.467
Please. Go check on the sauce.

54:19.555 --> 54:20.639
[sighs]

54:21.765 --> 54:23.725
I need to know that she's okay.

54:24.811 --> 54:26.645
I mean, I don't even know if she's alive.

54:26.728 --> 54:30.274
MCC is hiding behind
its private corporate status

54:30.357 --> 54:32.526
and not complying with federal laws.

54:34.570 --> 54:37.614
Our lawsuit just goes on and on
and she's lost in there!

54:37.698 --> 54:40.659
I assure you she is alive and well.

54:40.742 --> 54:43.079
Well, I need proof.

54:43.162 --> 54:44.872
I need documentation.

54:44.956 --> 54:47.041
I need records.
I need a paper trail.

54:47.124 --> 54:49.001
I'm entitled to that.

54:49.085 --> 54:50.419
She's a federal prisoner.

54:50.502 --> 54:51.963
What the fuck?

54:52.046 --> 54:54.506
I got mugged once in Newark.
Don't worry, it's registered.

54:54.590 --> 54:55.674
-What the fuck?
-No.

54:55.757 --> 54:58.219
No, no, no guns.
Put the gun away.

54:58.302 --> 55:01.555
This is a registered gun and you are
trespassing on private property.

55:01.638 --> 55:05.017
You've been asked to leave
and I'm going to ask you one more time.

55:05.101 --> 55:07.436
Please leave.
Now.

55:07.519 --> 55:10.189
-Get back in your car, sir.
-Oh, Jesus.

55:10.272 --> 55:11.983
You've got a gun on my girlfriend.

55:12.066 --> 55:14.360
Well, if your girlfriend
joins you in your car,

55:14.443 --> 55:16.362
she'll be far away from the gun.

55:17.321 --> 55:18.322
Okay?

55:18.405 --> 55:21.825
[Caputo] Call the office next time.
We will talk on the phone.

55:22.910 --> 55:23.995
[door closes]

55:28.624 --> 55:29.876
[sighs]

55:32.128 --> 55:33.795
That was so hot.

55:39.343 --> 55:40.802
[both moaning]

55:45.141 --> 55:46.767
[Piper sobbing]

55:58.362 --> 56:00.948
Are we sure about this?
I mean, that's still really tender.

56:01.032 --> 56:04.701
-[Piper sighs]
-We have to do it now or it won't match.

56:06.203 --> 56:08.205
Yeah.

56:08.289 --> 56:09.790
Let's do it.

56:09.873 --> 56:11.000
Okay.

56:12.001 --> 56:14.045
-Hold her tight.
-[whimpers]

56:18.549 --> 56:20.051
[crying]

56:23.930 --> 56:25.806
-[flesh burning]
-[screaming]

56:30.269 --> 56:31.687
[sobbing]

56:35.524 --> 56:37.609
I'm so sorry.

56:41.197 --> 56:42.656
[wailing]

56:44.200 --> 56:45.617
I know. I know.

56:45.701 --> 56:48.245
I'm so sorry...

56:48.329 --> 56:50.206
-[wailing]
-Oh.

56:52.083 --> 56:55.627
When God gives you a swastika,
he opens a window.

56:57.546 --> 56:59.048
[Piper continues sobbing]

57:06.263 --> 57:07.723
And then you remember...

57:08.765 --> 57:10.142
there is no God.

57:11.227 --> 57:12.937
