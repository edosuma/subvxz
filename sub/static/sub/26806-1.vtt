The timberwolf
used to rule these woods.

00:42.999 --> 00:45.784
He was revered
by the native tribes as a God.

00:47.308 --> 00:51.747
The European settlers came,
they hunted the wolves.

00:51.790 --> 00:55.446
Chased them north,
slaughtered them.

00:55.490 --> 00:58.058
The wolves of these regions
were thought to be extinct.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.365
But they're coming back.

01:01.409 --> 01:03.846
They know this is their home.

01:03.889 --> 01:07.415
They're fighters,
just like you.

01:09.547 --> 01:11.984
You were a fighter today...

01:13.334 --> 01:14.683
a wolf.

01:17.164 --> 01:20.515
That's just the kind of spirit
this park needs.

01:20.558 --> 01:23.561
You hungry?

01:23.605 --> 01:26.434
You wanna get something to eat,
little wolf?

01:33.093 --> 01:35.095
♪ Hey

01:35.138 --> 01:39.316
♪ Did you happen to see
the most beautiful girl ♪

01:39.360 --> 01:41.492

02:06.038 --> 02:09.041
It's the crusts, isn't it?

02:09.085 --> 02:10.913
I don't like them either.

02:16.397 --> 02:19.269
There,
lunch is served.

02:26.363 --> 02:30.933
About what happened,
we did what we could,

02:32.282 --> 02:34.154
no one will know.

02:53.651 --> 02:55.262
You're a wolf, Chelsea.

02:55.305 --> 02:56.437
Hello?

02:56.480 --> 02:58.265
Don't you ever forget that.

02:58.308 --> 02:59.308
Police!

03:00.528 --> 03:03.052
And don't you ever forget me.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.831
You've never done Echo before?

03:42.874 --> 03:44.093
Never?

Well welcome

03:45.616 --> 03:46.790
of your fucking life,
I guarantee.

03:46.791 --> 03:49.490
Garth, what the fuck is this?

03:49.533 --> 03:51.231
It's Christmas, baby,
ho ho ho.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.147
Ayo get in, Chels.

03:55.191 --> 03:57.062
Get in, it's delicious--

03:59.935 --> 04:01.935
and there's a lot more
where that came from.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.637
Dude that's my backpack.

04:06.681 --> 04:07.501
So?

04:07.508 --> 04:08.987
So I got personal shit in there.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.031
It's safely underneath my...

04:10.032 --> 04:11.903
Dude come on!

04:11.947 --> 04:15.167
What we really
should be discussing...

04:17.692 --> 04:19.781
is our new business venture.

04:19.824 --> 04:22.218
You mean
my new business venture.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.743
How did you score
so much of this anyway?

04:25.787 --> 04:28.311
I introduced Rod and his guys
to my little friend Guilty.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.270
Who's Guilty?

04:33.708 --> 04:35.187
This is Guilty.

04:35.231 --> 04:37.015
You have a pet name
for your knife?

04:44.284 --> 04:45.372
Yes.

05:09.004 --> 05:11.136
Where are you guys headed next?

05:11.180 --> 05:12.355
I don't know.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.704
What about you?

05:13.748 --> 05:15.619
Before this I was out in Cali,
ya know?

05:15.663 --> 05:17.186
I was hanging out
with this biker gang.

05:17.229 --> 05:19.319
They were the kids of
the Hell's Angels.

05:19.362 --> 05:20.755
Like fourth generation
so they've been riding

05:20.798 --> 05:21.973
ever since they were babies.

05:22.017 --> 05:24.236
They like grew up
on motorcycles.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.804
They could like, bike
before they could walk...

05:26.848 --> 05:28.980
You ever ride on a motorcycle?

05:29.024 --> 05:31.592
Dude, man,
I wish I had my own.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.550
All I've got
is this rat shit van

05:33.594 --> 05:35.596
I've been living out of.

06:56.720 --> 06:57.721
Chelsea!
Pigs!

06:57.765 --> 06:58.896
Yo we out!

07:04.336 --> 07:05.860
Chelsea!

07:07.078 --> 07:08.079
Chelsea!

07:08.123 --> 07:09.385
Get the stuff!

07:12.127 --> 07:13.868
Chelsea! Let's go!

07:31.146 --> 07:32.408
Hands up.

07:36.368 --> 07:39.981
You kids think that
this is a place to party?

07:41.330 --> 07:42.331
Chelsea!

08:00.741 --> 08:01.742
You stabbed him.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.657
I saved you...

08:08.357 --> 08:10.054
Chelsea, come on!

08:10.098 --> 08:11.491
Back up...

08:11.534 --> 08:14.885
44th and Main...

08:14.929 --> 08:19.107
I've been attacked
by a couple of punk fuckers.

08:19.150 --> 08:24.416
Male 20's, another female,
pink hair.

08:34.991 --> 08:36.864
Chelsea, come on!

08:44.785 --> 08:46.874
Stabbing a cop is serious time.

08:46.917 --> 08:47.831
I was saving my girl.

08:47.875 --> 08:48.832
And your stash.

08:48.876 --> 08:49.833
So romantic.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.661
We gotta get rid of it.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.968
Maybe we can put it somewhere
for safe keeping or something.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.883
Chelsea's got a place
in the woods.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.362
- Perfect.
- What?

08:57.406 --> 08:58.625
What?

08:58.668 --> 08:59.713
Your family's cabin,
you been saying

08:59.756 --> 09:00.975
you been wanting
to go back anyway,

09:01.018 --> 09:02.542
to be one with nature
or whatever.

09:02.585 --> 09:06.241
Not because we are on the run.

09:06.284 --> 09:09.070
Show them, seriously.

09:09.113 --> 09:11.768
Chelsea just show them,
just show them.

09:11.812 --> 09:12.769
I'll go through your bag.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.162
No.

09:15.903 --> 09:19.254
Dude, she carries around
this pic like it's Shangri-La.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.864
It's my uncle's old place.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.300
Aw is that you Chel?

09:22.344 --> 09:25.173
Yo, that hair.

09:25.216 --> 09:26.566
What a fucking girl scout.

09:26.609 --> 09:27.915
It's perfect.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.004
That is perfect.

09:30.047 --> 09:32.397
We go there, we let this shit
blow over our heads, that's it.

09:34.225 --> 09:35.923
Like classic outlaws.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.054
Guys.

09:38.229 --> 09:40.014
My uncle died there.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.451
So...

09:42.494 --> 09:43.626
Dude...

09:44.845 --> 09:45.802
Chelsea, he's not using it.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.543
It's not a squatting den.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.676
It's like a
safe house for us...

09:49.719 --> 09:50.807
ok fuck it, Chels.

09:50.851 --> 09:51.852
Put the fucking handcuffs on.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.462
Shut up, shut up.

09:55.029 --> 09:58.467
You guys really want
to be a part of this?

09:58.510 --> 10:00.600
Yeah, we're a family.

10:00.643 --> 10:03.646
Y'all going up,
we're going up too.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.736
Plus, it's not a bad place
to plan out the new business.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.521
So what do you think
about that, Garth?

10:09.565 --> 10:11.872
A clean four-way split?

10:11.915 --> 10:13.482
We don't gotta figure
the details out right now...

10:13.525 --> 10:15.440
Let's just figure out--

10:16.964 --> 10:20.184
Ok fuck dude,
four-way split, whatever.

10:20.228 --> 10:22.491
Okay look guys,
it's not a bad idea

10:22.534 --> 10:24.667
to skip town, I mean,
the cop called it in.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.495
I just don't know, if like--

10:26.538 --> 10:28.018
Shit, shit.

10:30.412 --> 10:33.502
Chelsea, I promise you,
your dead uncle

10:33.545 --> 10:36.723
will never know
we were there, alright?

10:36.766 --> 10:38.942
Girl Scout's honour.

11:17.589 --> 11:18.678
Time for us to leave anyway.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.375
The scene was dead.

11:22.116 --> 11:24.945
What type of shit do you think
they'd charge you with?

11:24.988 --> 11:27.425
I don't know man,
it depends if I hit a major artery.

11:27.469 --> 11:31.821
Was he a fucking deputy pig,
was he a sergeant?

11:31.865 --> 11:33.693
You know, that shit matters.

11:39.263 --> 11:40.395
Oh.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.615
Look, who's finally awake.

11:43.659 --> 11:44.965
Hey guys.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.836
Yo you were passed out.

11:48.446 --> 11:51.536
Should we add kidnapping
to the charges too now dude?

11:51.580 --> 11:53.234
Good night, huh?

12:03.897 --> 12:06.377
Sorry that we stole your van.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.424
Dude, I get it, the police.

12:10.991 --> 12:13.689
I should of been up for that.

12:13.733 --> 12:17.301
Thanks for not leaving me
back there to get arrested.

12:17.345 --> 12:20.130
My parents
would of been supremely pissed.

12:20.174 --> 12:22.829
We don't really talk anymore,

12:22.872 --> 12:25.179
but I imagine
if I got stuck in jail,

12:25.222 --> 12:28.965
I'd have to call them for bail.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.620
Jeez, that would suck...

12:31.663 --> 12:33.927
I'm so hungry.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.406
Yeah, me too...

12:37.844 --> 12:39.933
got any money?

12:39.976 --> 12:42.152
No,

12:42.196 --> 12:50.030
because I spent it all on this.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.206
Thank God...

12:58.342 --> 12:59.996
You want some?

13:00.040 --> 13:01.911
It's better than coffee.

13:01.955 --> 13:03.783
- I'm good.
- No?

13:20.451 --> 13:22.192
Jerk, let's go! Jerk!

13:41.124 --> 13:43.213
How many times
do I have to tell you?

13:43.257 --> 13:45.520
Seal your trash, Parker.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.522
Enough attacks as it is
without you inviting the bears

13:47.565 --> 13:49.089
to waltz in here.

13:49.132 --> 13:52.527
Yeah
yeah, I'll get right on that...

13:52.570 --> 13:55.530
Busy day, from the looks of it.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.271
A lot of out-of-state plates
in the parking lot.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.806
Miss?

14:10.850 --> 14:11.938
Miss?

14:13.200 --> 14:14.418
Miss?

14:18.640 --> 14:19.728
You look lost.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.609
Where are you
kids coming up from?

14:31.653 --> 14:33.524
Um... the city.

14:35.526 --> 14:36.788
Camping or what?

14:36.832 --> 14:42.969
I doubt everyone else is leaving
they are not arriving.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.274
Chels,
we know where we're going or what?

14:44.318 --> 14:45.928
The mountain's closed.

14:45.972 --> 14:46.842
You can't close a mountain.

14:46.886 --> 14:47.930
It doesn't belong to you.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.976
Yeah, it belongs to the Earth.

14:50.019 --> 14:52.761
It belongs to the
United States government.

14:52.804 --> 14:54.632
It's a National Park.

14:54.676 --> 14:55.938
And if the government
doesn't deem it safe,

14:55.982 --> 14:57.984
I can in fact close it.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.594
It's Chelsea's mountain,
she's got a house up there,

14:59.637 --> 15:01.639
Chels, tell him.

15:01.683 --> 15:04.947
Uh, it's a cabin by Stone Road.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.427
The old Benson place?

15:06.470 --> 15:09.909
The new Chelsea place,
it's her's.

15:09.952 --> 15:12.912
Nobody's been up there
in years...

15:16.045 --> 15:17.307
how about that.

15:19.875 --> 15:22.225
Don, don, don.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.662
Look, Mr. Park Ranger, sir.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.926
We really appreciate
your service and all that.

15:26.969 --> 15:27.927
But Chelsea here--

15:27.970 --> 15:30.668
she's got property
on this mountain.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.540
And last time I checked,
there wasn't anything

15:32.583 --> 15:34.542
in the ol' law books that said
a land-owner couldn't mozy up

15:34.585 --> 15:36.457
to their own home...

15:46.293 --> 15:48.904
You're littering, son.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.864
What are you going to do
about it Mr. Park Ranger, sir?

15:52.908 --> 15:55.998
Littering, or dumping of refuse
inside a national park land

15:56.042 --> 15:57.130
is prohibited.

15:57.173 --> 16:03.527
Code 2.41-82 and carries
a fine of $250.00.

16:03.571 --> 16:06.139
Why don't you bill me, asshole.

16:06.182 --> 16:09.316
Jesus guys,
it's just a stupid wrapper.

16:09.359 --> 16:12.319
This young lady
may have property up there,

16:12.362 --> 16:16.497
but make no mistake,
this is my mountain.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.847
And by allowing you
to visit my mountain,

16:18.890 --> 16:21.415
I expect you to abide
by the law.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.286
The laws of Mother Nature.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.724
Well thanks a lot,
Smokey Bear.

16:28.813 --> 16:30.511
Be careful.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.992
There are poachers out there...

16:33.035 --> 16:35.168
and it's hunting season.

16:35.211 --> 16:37.257
Wear bright colors.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.172
Uh, bright enough for ya?

16:40.564 --> 16:41.870
Damn Fascists.

16:41.913 --> 16:44.786
Fuck the police!

16:44.829 --> 16:46.483
...fucking totalitarianism.

16:54.491 --> 16:55.884
Yeah, man!

16:55.927 --> 16:56.928
Now what?

16:56.972 --> 16:57.929
Now what Mr. Bear.

17:29.918 --> 17:31.789
Shut up, shut up!

17:37.056 --> 17:39.145
Baby, like Bonnie and Clyde!

17:39.188 --> 17:40.581
Yeah you're famous now,

17:40.624 --> 17:42.409
you're parents are gonna be
super proud.

17:42.452 --> 17:44.237
This is crazy!

17:44.280 --> 17:46.152
Oh shit!

17:47.718 --> 17:50.939
Uh, Garth,
it's the next left.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.090
Home sweet home?

18:12.787 --> 18:14.528
I forgot how big
these woods were.

18:14.571 --> 18:16.573
How lost you could get.

18:16.617 --> 18:17.444
Alright, we're in the woods.

18:17.487 --> 18:18.923
Where the cabin at?

18:18.967 --> 18:20.316
Oh, we have to leave
the van here

18:20.360 --> 18:21.491
and walk the rest of the way.

18:21.535 --> 18:23.102
- Huh?
- Yeah.

18:23.145 --> 18:24.886
Do I look like
a mountain climber?

18:24.929 --> 18:27.149
Yeah, it's less than a mile.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.064
- A mile?
- Yes, come on.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.761
Fuck, man.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.154
I got asthma.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.416
Come on.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.939
Really?

18:53.697 --> 18:55.046
We could write a song
outta that.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.397
Oh yeah.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.268
Take nothing but pictures!

18:59.312 --> 19:02.184
Leave nothing but footprints!

19:02.228 --> 19:03.881
Take nothing but pictures!

19:03.925 --> 19:05.883
Leave nothing but footprints!

20:05.856 --> 20:08.381
How about Oral Panic?

20:11.035 --> 20:13.212
...Oral Panic Party?

20:13.255 --> 20:15.214
Nah.

20:16.650 --> 20:20.697
Dystopic Surgical Hour...

20:22.786 --> 20:24.658
Societal Scum?

20:24.701 --> 20:27.704
Dude, I thought
we were The Devioids?

20:27.748 --> 20:29.837
That just sounds like
every other band name.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.404
It has to be something
that really stands out.

20:31.447 --> 20:32.883
It just sounds
kind of science-y.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.716
Yo, yo!

20:39.760 --> 20:42.458
Home, let's go!

20:44.243 --> 20:45.766
It actually exists.

20:45.809 --> 20:46.767
Done with that.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.116
Thank you, Jesus.

20:48.159 --> 20:50.031
Tired of lugging this stuff
around.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.558
Everybody, cheers!

21:00.955 --> 21:02.130
Hey is someone here?

21:02.173 --> 21:03.349
They planted flowers.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.133
Oh, no those are perennials.

21:05.176 --> 21:06.265
They come back on their own.

21:11.835 --> 21:15.622
Okay, okay, okay you guys.
Let's go inside.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.583
- Yo G.
- Yo!

21:20.627 --> 21:21.454
Help me out.

21:35.555 --> 21:37.426
Sick.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.171
It smells like oranges in here.

21:43.214 --> 21:44.346
Smells citrus-y.

21:48.829 --> 21:52.702
Ayo Chels,
where the blankets at?

21:52.746 --> 21:55.052
Why doesn't anyone come up here?

21:55.096 --> 21:56.445
Nobody wanted to deal
with the place

21:56.489 --> 21:58.317
after my uncle was killed.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.058
Killed?

22:01.102 --> 22:02.973
He was attacked by a wolf.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.635
He was ripped to shreds.

22:15.812 --> 22:17.205
Awkward.

22:17.248 --> 22:19.860
Chelsea, you never told us
anything about wolves.

22:19.903 --> 22:21.992
Yeah well,
there's a lot of crazy animals

22:22.036 --> 22:23.559
in this park.

22:23.603 --> 22:27.476
There's wolves, bears--

22:27.520 --> 22:29.565
Lions and tigers, oh my.

22:31.219 --> 22:32.481
And they are attracted
to garbage

22:32.525 --> 22:35.354
so we should probably keep
the place clean.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.834
And also blood
so you should bandage up

22:37.878 --> 22:38.922
your mess of a face, Jerk.

22:38.966 --> 22:40.576
Whatever, Knife-Fight.

22:40.620 --> 22:43.405
Hey Chelsea,
there's a bedroom up here.

22:43.449 --> 22:45.929
Yeah dude, it's a house.

22:47.714 --> 22:49.106
Your uncle must've been bored.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.282
What did he do up here
all by himself?

22:51.326 --> 22:56.331
He was a writer,
so he just wanted to be alone.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.811
I'd spend my summers up here
with him.

22:57.854 --> 22:59.508
Just us.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.075
I'd fucking kill myself
if I had to spend the summer

23:01.118 --> 23:02.685
up here alone.

23:02.729 --> 23:06.210
Yeah like those chairs,
we'd sit there

23:06.254 --> 23:08.387
and he'd read me his stories
before bed...

23:11.564 --> 23:17.004
And then this
one day he went hunting

23:17.047 --> 23:19.441
and didn't come back.

23:22.313 --> 23:23.750
He was found
in the middle of the woods

23:23.793 --> 23:25.534
with his face
completely chewed off.

23:26.666 --> 23:27.928
Shit.

23:32.672 --> 23:34.848
Oh dude,
you can't smoke in here.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.937
What do you mean
we can't smoke?

23:36.980 --> 23:40.897
Well it's just my uncle used
to smoke on the porch.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.725
No worries,
it's fine Chelsea.

23:44.205 --> 23:45.293
Chelsea,
there's no parents here.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.338
There's no uncles,
there's no cops.

23:47.382 --> 23:49.123
You want to smoke
in the living room?

23:52.343 --> 23:54.868
Smoke in the living room.

23:54.911 --> 23:56.086
Yeah!

23:56.130 --> 23:57.436
You want to scream and howl?

23:59.960 --> 24:01.309
You scream and howl.

24:01.352 --> 24:02.571
Howl for us, Chelsea!

24:02.615 --> 24:04.138
- I'm good.
- Come on, you gotta!

24:04.181 --> 24:06.488
You want to scream
'cause this world is bullshit.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.272
You want to howl because
your asshole of a boyfriend--

24:08.316 --> 24:09.535
Hey what are you...

24:09.578 --> 24:11.145
--stabbed a cop
and sent us all on the run!

24:11.188 --> 24:12.581
Alright first of all
you didn't have to come.

24:12.625 --> 24:14.148
We could have dropped
you off somewhere.

24:14.191 --> 24:15.497
The point is,
if you wanna howl...

24:15.541 --> 24:16.933
fucking howl.

24:19.240 --> 24:22.591
Can somebody please stop her
from doing that again.

24:22.635 --> 24:24.245
Yo listen to this.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.691
I'm going for a walk.

24:35.735 --> 24:37.519
Alright but watch out
for them wolves.

26:17.271 --> 26:19.316
Oh my God,
don't sneak up on me.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.580
Don't make it so easy.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.712
You think I'm easy, huh?

26:23.756 --> 26:27.020
I'm just responding
to what you put out.

26:27.063 --> 26:29.413
Are you asking if I'll put out?

26:50.739 --> 26:51.871
What?

26:53.960 --> 26:55.004
Did you put this up?

26:55.048 --> 26:56.658
- Did I put this up?
- Yes!

26:56.702 --> 26:58.355
What the fuck do you
mean, did I put it up?

27:01.358 --> 27:04.057
Power to the Gods,
we are on a peninsula.

27:13.588 --> 27:18.724
How about
Diplomatic Desecration?

27:18.767 --> 27:20.464
I thought
we were The Devioids.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.031
That just sounds
like every other band.

27:22.075 --> 27:23.380
I like it...

27:27.820 --> 27:29.604
This place
isn't completely barren.

27:39.396 --> 27:41.094
Oh baby Chelsea...

27:48.449 --> 27:50.233
She's not in here?

27:50.277 --> 27:52.061
No, I don't think so.

28:59.259 --> 29:00.173
I didn't recognize you.

29:00.216 --> 29:01.348
Fuck.

29:03.132 --> 29:05.395
The pink hair...
it threw me off.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.312
You came back.

29:09.356 --> 29:11.227
After all these years.

29:14.143 --> 29:15.971
You... came back.

29:19.279 --> 29:21.585
Do you remember me?

29:21.629 --> 29:24.197
It's all kind of a blur.

29:24.240 --> 29:27.809
Yeah, I guess
I can understand that.

29:29.419 --> 29:31.073
It's been a long time.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.642
My hair's changed too.

29:35.861 --> 29:38.559
It's a lot grayer now.

29:38.602 --> 29:40.213
Maybe I should try pink.

29:45.435 --> 29:47.873
How'd you end up
with a crowd like that?

29:49.178 --> 29:51.137
The girl I remember
wouldn't be running

29:51.180 --> 29:54.009
with them kinds of kids.

29:54.053 --> 29:56.795
Yeah, I should get back.

29:56.838 --> 29:58.057
To your friends.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.841
Yeah, I've been gone
for a while.

30:01.974 --> 30:03.845
They're from the city...

30:03.889 --> 30:05.760
not used to this outdoors stuff.

30:07.849 --> 30:09.982
Wouldn't want them
to burn the place down.

30:10.025 --> 30:12.201
No, we wouldn't...

30:13.681 --> 30:18.251
Well if you need anything
while you're here...

30:18.294 --> 30:20.731
Anything I can do.

30:20.775 --> 30:22.733
Or if you want to just...

30:22.777 --> 30:26.868
hang out, go for a walk,
catch up.

30:29.392 --> 30:31.873
I could show you
some pretty cool spots.

30:34.833 --> 30:38.358
Well, my cabin's just
at the top of the mountain.

30:38.401 --> 30:40.403
Near the fire tower.

30:40.447 --> 30:42.231
You can see it from here.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.105
You remember--
don't you?

30:50.239 --> 30:53.155
Yeah, thanks.

30:53.199 --> 30:55.941
Anything at all
for Pete Benson's niece.

31:05.602 --> 31:08.257
What about a little
something like this.

31:09.476 --> 31:11.652
Dude, what are you doing?

31:11.695 --> 31:13.523
I don't know, I think it'd be
better in bubble letters.

31:13.567 --> 31:17.136
Wait guys,
what are you doing?

31:17.179 --> 31:18.920
The Devioids.

31:18.964 --> 31:21.488
Guys you can't just
spray paint a tree.

31:21.531 --> 31:23.490
You're just tagging trees?

31:23.533 --> 31:25.666
- Hey, let me write your name.
- No!

31:25.709 --> 31:26.667
Jerk stop.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.583
That'll kill the tree.

31:33.239 --> 31:34.240
Yes!

31:34.283 --> 31:35.502
Burn baby, burn!

31:46.034 --> 31:48.689
Dude there's a real fire pit
on the other side of the house.

31:48.732 --> 31:50.299
- Chill out.
- Chill out?

31:51.344 --> 31:53.999
Fuck you...

31:54.042 --> 31:57.132
This is what happens
when I walk away for an hour.

31:57.176 --> 31:58.525
But I guess you're all
just completely capable

31:58.568 --> 31:59.700
of handling yourselves.

32:01.528 --> 32:03.008
- Relax.
- I'm sorry.

32:03.051 --> 32:06.272
Yo Chels, come here,
come here.

32:06.315 --> 32:08.448
This place isn't your ash tray

32:09.623 --> 32:11.320
and I'm not your fucking maid.

32:21.113 --> 32:23.680
Wait, guys,
that's not the maid?

34:42.775 --> 34:43.994
Where is it?

34:44.038 --> 34:46.431
Feeling better Chelsea?

34:46.475 --> 34:48.956
Who the fuck
went through my stuff?

34:53.873 --> 34:56.703
What are you talking about?

34:56.746 --> 34:58.183
Who was it?

35:18.725 --> 35:20.770
Whoa you're not
looking too well, Chel.

35:20.814 --> 35:23.033
A bump of Echo
and you'll be good as new.

35:34.001 --> 35:35.524
Uh, this is Ground Control
for Major Garth.

35:35.568 --> 35:36.525
Earth to Garth.

35:36.569 --> 35:37.700
You're terrible at that game.

35:37.744 --> 35:38.832
Earth to Garth.

35:38.875 --> 35:40.138
Where did you find those?

35:40.181 --> 35:41.530
Oh these?

35:41.574 --> 35:43.750
In one of those closets.

35:43.793 --> 35:45.926
Can you believe there are still
working batteries in these guys?

35:47.188 --> 35:49.059
Oh we also found this.

35:50.974 --> 35:53.063
They're coming to get you,
Chelsea.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.197
Earth to Garth.

35:56.241 --> 35:57.546
Your brain's been eaten away
by maggots

35:57.590 --> 35:59.069
and there's nothing
anyone can do about it.

35:59.113 --> 36:01.942
Copy, this is General Garth...

36:01.985 --> 36:03.813
fuck you, shut the fuck up.

36:06.120 --> 36:09.950
Guys, we need to talk about
what the master plan is.

36:09.993 --> 36:12.257
- What?
- What do you mean?

36:12.300 --> 36:14.520
Are we all gonna stay
here forever?

36:14.563 --> 36:17.523
Create our own little commune
in the woods?

36:17.566 --> 36:19.177
Sooner or later
we're gonna run out of...

36:19.220 --> 36:20.569
beef jerky.

36:20.613 --> 36:23.137
Okay, we can use G's knife
to kill animals for food.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.312
I told you.

36:24.356 --> 36:26.445
Guilty only kills assholes,
not animals.

36:26.488 --> 36:28.098
At some point,
we're gonna have to face

36:28.142 --> 36:29.143
what we did.

36:29.187 --> 36:32.407
Or keep running... to Canada.

36:33.930 --> 36:39.240
Hey, why are you worrying?

36:39.284 --> 36:41.851
Why don't we just enjoy
the vacation.

36:41.895 --> 36:44.724
What's up?
Talk to me, what's up.

36:44.767 --> 36:47.161
Sorry about the fire.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.336
This is your place
and it's awesome

36:48.380 --> 36:50.120
you're letting us stay here.

36:50.164 --> 36:52.427
We'll try not to fuck up again.

36:54.777 --> 36:56.039
It's just hitting me,

36:56.083 --> 36:58.041
we are gonna be in
so much fucking trouble.

36:58.085 --> 36:59.129
Us?

36:59.173 --> 37:00.479
Babe, I'll face it alright?

37:00.522 --> 37:01.654
Not you.

37:03.003 --> 37:05.310
We should leave this place.

37:05.353 --> 37:07.137
We need to keep moving.

37:08.791 --> 37:10.967
Coming up here
was a really bad idea.

37:16.843 --> 37:17.931
Come on you two,

37:17.974 --> 37:19.454
what are you lovebirds
even talking about?

38:18.774 --> 38:20.602
We need to cover it up.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.565
Amber, take this.

38:26.608 --> 38:28.393
It'll make you feel better.

38:33.136 --> 38:36.052
- Hunting season.
- What?

38:36.096 --> 38:39.055
It's hunting season.

38:39.099 --> 38:41.057
Isn't that what
the ranger-dude said?

38:42.668 --> 38:44.322
We gotta get her to a hospital.

38:44.365 --> 38:47.281
We gotta get her back
to the van.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.066
But the van is like a mile away.

39:06.169 --> 39:07.432
Is anyone out there?

39:12.698 --> 39:14.439
Hello, is anyone out there?

39:16.876 --> 39:18.921
Hello, hello,

This is bad,
we need a plan, we need help.

40:31.864 --> 40:32.995
Here's one.

40:33.039 --> 40:33.953
What the fuck Garth.

40:33.996 --> 40:34.954
That could kill her.

40:34.997 --> 40:36.172
Or send her
into a blissful sleep

40:36.216 --> 40:38.087
until we figure this shit out.

41:01.894 --> 41:04.853
Okay, okay,
Abe, Jerk...

41:04.897 --> 41:06.594
You two stay here...

41:06.638 --> 41:09.031
See if a car comes,
get her to a hospital.

41:09.075 --> 41:10.816
Garth, you and I
are going up there to see

41:10.859 --> 41:13.253
if there's a phone.

41:13.296 --> 41:14.689
Yes, that's what we are doing.

41:14.733 --> 41:16.212
- Oh, yeah.
- Take this...

41:16.256 --> 41:17.649
...let us know if a car comes...

41:17.692 --> 41:19.302
Let's stay on channel one, okay?

41:19.346 --> 41:21.957
Yo Abe, fucking careful
with that shit.

41:22.001 --> 41:22.958
Come on.

41:41.803 --> 41:44.502
You sure there's a phone there?

41:44.545 --> 41:45.981
There was no phone
at your uncle's place.

41:46.025 --> 41:48.636
There's a radio,
I remember there being a radio.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.072
You've been there?

41:50.116 --> 41:52.205
Yeah, when I was a kid.

41:52.248 --> 41:56.644
The Ranger was working here
when I used to come visit.

41:56.688 --> 41:58.516
He helped me after--

41:58.559 --> 42:00.300
everything that happened
with my uncle.

42:00.343 --> 42:02.128
That's where it comes from.

42:02.171 --> 42:03.433
What?

42:06.611 --> 42:07.655
Oh, come on Chelsea.

42:07.699 --> 42:09.657
Your hard-on
for authority figures?

42:09.701 --> 42:11.180
Excuse me?

42:11.224 --> 42:13.531
Chelsea, your knee-jerk instinct
to run to the closest dude

42:13.574 --> 42:14.923
in a uniform
when the going gets tough.

42:14.967 --> 42:16.403
Fuck you, Garth.

42:16.446 --> 42:19.188
It's okay,
boy scout's gonna save us, right?

42:19.232 --> 42:21.016
Chelsea, how many band-aids
do you think

42:21.060 --> 42:22.757
it's gonna take to take
to fix Amber's skull?

42:22.801 --> 42:26.152
Dude, would you rather
we let her bleed to death?

42:26.195 --> 42:27.632
Let's just get our asses
to the cowboy

42:27.675 --> 42:29.547
and let him save the day.

42:42.037 --> 42:43.604
She's looking really bad.

42:45.737 --> 42:47.565
Maybe just a little more?

42:56.922 --> 42:58.750
I think it's helping.

42:58.793 --> 43:00.360
You're okay.

43:04.146 --> 43:07.715
Oh shit!

43:07.759 --> 43:09.935
Why did you give her so much?

43:11.414 --> 43:12.720
I'm going to get us some help.

43:12.764 --> 43:14.461
Hey! Don't leave me alone
with her.

43:14.504 --> 43:15.897
I'll run down the mountain,

43:15.941 --> 43:17.682
try to get back
to the rest stop.

43:17.725 --> 43:19.031
But that's like two miles away.

43:19.074 --> 43:21.511
What else
are we supposed to do?

43:21.555 --> 43:25.559
Babe, please don't leave me,
please don't leave me.

43:30.042 --> 43:32.522
You're fine, you're fine.

43:33.915 --> 43:36.309
I'm going to get us some help.

43:36.352 --> 43:38.006
Just make sure she stays awake.

43:38.050 --> 43:39.399
How?

43:41.662 --> 43:43.316
Sing to her.

43:52.717 --> 43:54.196
You're being a child.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.502
And you keep acting like
you're better than everyone.

43:55.545 --> 43:56.938
Why don't you just own up to it.

43:56.982 --> 43:58.026
Own up to what?

43:58.070 --> 43:59.245
You really don't care about us.

43:59.288 --> 44:00.420
You don't care about me,
Jerk, Abe.

44:00.463 --> 44:02.422
You gotta be kidding.

44:02.465 --> 44:04.206
You didn't want us to
come to your precious hideaway.

44:04.250 --> 44:05.991
Yeah, because I know
what you're all like.

44:07.906 --> 44:09.734
You were going to destroy
the few pleasant memories

44:09.777 --> 44:11.039
I still have of this place.

44:11.083 --> 44:13.607
What we're all like?

44:13.651 --> 44:15.783
What we're all like is family.

44:15.827 --> 44:17.785
It may not be the Brady Bunch
but it's what we've fucking got.

44:17.829 --> 44:18.830
We have to keep going.

44:18.873 --> 44:20.353
From the second
we got on the road

44:20.396 --> 44:22.877
you've been acting like
a complete weirdo, Chelsea.

44:25.619 --> 44:27.273
Now we've all tried
to give you your space,

44:27.316 --> 44:29.928
but I don't know
what else we can do

44:29.971 --> 44:31.103
We get it, you resent us.

44:31.146 --> 44:32.365
We're stains
on what would have been

44:32.408 --> 44:34.149
an otherwise idyllic life.

44:34.193 --> 44:35.977
We're the bad guys,
and you're the tourist,

44:36.021 --> 44:37.936
and you should just be able
to come and go as you please.

44:40.199 --> 44:41.853
Chels?

44:41.896 --> 44:43.724
You've been a fuckin' tourist
for years now.

44:43.768 --> 44:45.421
Sooner or later you're going
to have to face the fact

44:45.465 --> 44:48.555
that maybe, just maybe,
this is your life.

44:48.598 --> 44:51.471
It's not the prettiest thing,
but it's the one you built.

44:51.514 --> 44:54.169
So it would be fucking lovely
if you could find it in yourself

44:54.213 --> 44:55.475
to drop the victim bullshit

44:55.518 --> 44:57.216
and take some responsibility
for once.

44:58.957 --> 44:59.958
Dude?

45:02.961 --> 45:04.789
What the fuck.

45:06.312 --> 45:07.705
Is that a person?

45:07.748 --> 45:10.185
Oh my fucking God.

45:10.229 --> 45:12.013
He's dead.

45:12.057 --> 45:13.885
You really didn't have to
get that close to tell me, Chels.

45:13.928 --> 45:15.016
What did this?

45:15.060 --> 45:18.585
A wolf, right?
Or like a bear?

45:18.628 --> 45:22.545
What the fuck is going on
in these fucking woods.

45:22.589 --> 45:25.287
Let's just get to a phone.

45:28.421 --> 45:31.729
Take nothing but pictures...

45:36.646 --> 45:39.824
Leave nothing but footprints.

45:45.655 --> 45:50.051
It's just like every other band
is called The Devioids.

45:52.140 --> 45:56.449
There's The Destitutes
and The Destroyed.

45:58.973 --> 46:01.062
I think sometimes
we over-think these things,

46:01.106 --> 46:03.456
and then they just get
all jumbled up in our minds...

46:03.499 --> 46:05.240
And we don't know
what sounds good anymore...

46:11.029 --> 46:12.944
I miss my mom.

46:16.686 --> 46:17.949
Oh, thank God!

46:22.997 --> 46:24.259
Help!

46:24.303 --> 46:26.044
Help, please!

46:26.087 --> 46:27.610
Please stop!

46:34.966 --> 46:36.663
Hi, hey, our friend...

46:36.706 --> 46:38.404
She was shot.
She's ODing.

46:38.447 --> 46:39.448
She's hurt really bad.

46:39.492 --> 46:40.885
We need to get her
to a hospital.

46:40.928 --> 46:44.453
Oh no, well let me help you
move her.

46:44.497 --> 46:46.934
We have to be careful.

46:52.461 --> 46:54.289
Come on, you're okay.

47:08.608 --> 47:13.178
Yeah, she's just about gone.

47:13.221 --> 47:14.919
What did you guys do?

47:14.962 --> 47:16.485
We gave her this.

47:16.529 --> 47:17.965
For the pain.

47:18.009 --> 47:20.141
You kids...

47:20.185 --> 47:22.883
There's no equivalent
to that in nature.

47:22.927 --> 47:24.798
That's how you know
it's not very good for you.

47:24.842 --> 47:26.495
Alright, don't need a lecture...

47:28.106 --> 47:30.021
Sir.

47:30.064 --> 47:31.892
Where are the others?

47:31.936 --> 47:32.980
They went to get help...

47:33.024 --> 47:34.503
Jerk went back
to the rest stop,

47:34.547 --> 47:36.592
and Chelsea and Garth
went to the fire tower,

47:36.636 --> 47:38.986
trying to find a radio.

47:39.030 --> 47:42.424
Well,
we can't get her to a hospital.

47:44.949 --> 47:46.951
What do you mean?

47:46.994 --> 47:48.300
Too far.

47:48.343 --> 47:50.780
We'll never make it in time.

47:50.824 --> 47:52.782
We have to try.

47:52.826 --> 47:54.915
No.

47:54.959 --> 47:58.310
No, best to put her
out of her misery.

47:58.353 --> 47:58.876
What the!

48:01.661 --> 48:03.097
Oh shit!
Oh, fuck!

48:03.141 --> 48:05.491
The consumption
of alcoholic beverages

48:05.534 --> 48:07.319
or the possession
of an open container

48:07.362 --> 48:10.496
of an alcoholic beverage
while visiting a national park

48:10.539 --> 48:13.064
is strictly prohibited...

48:13.107 --> 48:15.893
Section 3.25-A1.

48:21.681 --> 48:23.465
Violators will be punished.

48:40.134 --> 48:41.353
Guys?

48:41.396 --> 48:43.616
Guys!

48:43.659 --> 48:45.444
Please someone.

49:22.133 --> 49:24.265
Hunting, trapping,
feeding, teasing,

49:24.309 --> 49:29.401
or otherwise disturbing animals
is prohibited...

49:29.444 --> 49:30.793
Ah!

49:32.230 --> 49:34.667
I see your problem there.

49:34.710 --> 49:37.148
Your spring lock is rusted shut.

49:37.191 --> 49:38.845
Help me.

49:38.888 --> 49:40.325
Please.

49:40.368 --> 49:43.763
You got a permit to be using
one of these traps?

49:43.806 --> 49:47.985
You think
you can pull yourself free?

49:48.028 --> 49:49.377
Fuck you!

49:52.554 --> 49:54.034
Go ahead.

49:54.078 --> 49:57.472
I'm a big proponent
atch and release.

49:57.516 --> 50:01.911
If you can pry yourself loose,

50:01.955 --> 50:03.522
you're free to go.

50:05.698 --> 50:07.221
Ten...

50:07.265 --> 50:08.614
Nine...

50:08.657 --> 50:10.050
Eight...

50:10.094 --> 50:11.356
Seven...

50:11.399 --> 50:12.531
Six...

50:12.574 --> 50:14.663
Go on get after it!

50:14.707 --> 50:16.796
Five!

50:16.839 --> 50:18.841
Four...

50:18.885 --> 50:21.192
Three...

50:21.235 --> 50:22.410
Two...

50:22.454 --> 50:23.977
One!

50:31.202 --> 50:33.595
Strong work, friend.

50:33.639 --> 50:36.163
And just in time...

50:36.207 --> 50:40.080
Property may not be left
unattended longer than 24 hours.

50:41.690 --> 50:45.433
Found property must be brought
to the nearest park ranger.

50:49.263 --> 50:52.136
You have a good night.

50:52.179 --> 50:55.052
And fair warning,
you best get a move on

50:55.095 --> 50:57.967
before the wolves come out...

50:58.011 --> 51:00.274
Disabled persons may enter
and exit the park

51:00.318 --> 51:02.363
at designated locations.

Sometimes you go into the woods,

52:45.423 --> 52:47.990
So what exactly
are you doing in here, Son?

53:18.499 --> 53:20.284
What's my deal?

53:20.327 --> 53:23.069
My deal is to keep the trash

53:23.112 --> 53:24.940
Harry S. Truman enlisted me

55:14.920 --> 55:16.835
The Severed.

55:18.924 --> 55:21.492
We can be called The Severed.

Alright!

Hello?

55:43.731 --> 55:45.559
Ranger's house.

55:56.004 --> 55:57.832
I don't see the radio.

57:21.176 --> 57:23.614
Did he do this to you?

57:23.657 --> 57:24.876
Why?

57:43.895 --> 57:45.200
What are those?

57:49.422 --> 57:51.903
He seems to have a fuck
ton of photos of you.

57:57.212 --> 58:00.128
Chelsea what's with this guy?

58:00.172 --> 58:02.000
What did this guy do to you?

58:03.741 --> 58:05.177
Shit!
Oh come on, come on.

Chels?

58:53.921 --> 58:55.662
There's got to be a way out.

59:09.067 --> 59:11.417
You should of
told me you were coming.

59:12.636 --> 59:15.116
I would've tidied up.

59:15.160 --> 59:17.902
Back the fuck up, man...

59:17.945 --> 59:19.294
I mean it.

59:20.992 --> 59:23.211
I've been watching you.

Back the fuck up, man!

59:29.827 --> 59:31.611
There is no need to curse.

59:35.267 --> 59:37.399
We tell the hunters
not to come...

59:38.966 --> 59:41.012
We tell them the mountain's
not safe these days.

59:41.055 --> 59:42.883
But they insist...

59:45.494 --> 59:46.408
Who the fuck are you?

59:46.452 --> 59:48.889
Garth, don't.

59:48.933 --> 59:51.457
This guy walks in here,
points his gun at us,

59:54.591 --> 59:56.897
has a fucking corpse
in his basement?

59:59.465 --> 01:00:02.250
Just who the fuck
do you think you are?

01:00:02.294 --> 01:00:04.731
Chelsea.

01:00:04.775 --> 01:00:06.733
I think your friend is under
a lot of stress right now.

01:00:08.256 --> 01:00:10.432
This is an unfamiliar
environment.

01:00:11.782 --> 01:00:13.871
We see this a lot
with trapped animals.

01:00:13.914 --> 01:00:15.524
They're used
to the wide-open space.

01:00:15.568 --> 01:00:17.875
The second they're in a corner,

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.313
they lash out.

01:00:21.356 --> 01:00:22.793
Calling me an animal?

01:00:25.186 --> 01:00:27.275
Stop pointing your gun
at my boyfriend.

01:00:28.494 --> 01:00:31.540
Chelsea, I shouldn't need
to tell you...

01:00:31.584 --> 01:00:34.500
Federal law prohibits firearms
in this park.

01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:45.424
Still got it in you, I see.

01:01:04.225 --> 01:01:05.792
We have our work cut out for us,

01:01:05.836 --> 01:01:08.403
but we'll bring you back
from the brink, I promise.

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:12.799
Don't be frightened,
little wolf,

01:01:12.843 --> 01:01:14.758
I'll take care of you.

01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:55.467
We've been waiting for you...

01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:06.913
Welcome back, little wolf...

01:03:08.959 --> 01:03:10.787
Welcome home, my love.

01:03:59.139 --> 01:04:02.229
♪ Alone again

01:04:02.273 --> 01:04:03.752
♪ I never thought

01:04:03.796 --> 01:04:07.669
♪ I'd be alone again

01:04:07.713 --> 01:04:12.761
♪ When we met
I thought my life began ♪

01:04:12.805 --> 01:04:14.502
♪ Now I'm alone again

01:04:14.546 --> 01:04:16.069
Take it easy.

01:04:19.899 --> 01:04:21.292
I gave you a big dose
of that stuff

01:04:21.335 --> 01:04:23.207
you've all been snorting.

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:28.952
You can't shoot it.

01:04:28.995 --> 01:04:31.128
Too strong, I know.

01:04:31.171 --> 01:04:34.348
But you bring that stuff
up here,

01:04:34.392 --> 01:04:35.784
it must mean
you want to be on it.

01:04:35.828 --> 01:04:39.005
So here you go.

01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:41.921
Maybe if we overdo it a little
we can finally get it out

01:04:41.965 --> 01:04:44.532
of your system for good.

01:04:44.576 --> 01:04:48.188
You see, Chelsea,
what we plan to do here

01:04:48.232 --> 01:04:51.800
is strip the city
from your bones.

01:04:51.844 --> 01:04:55.892
Peel all the layers
of your polluted existence away.

01:05:03.595 --> 01:05:07.425
That includes getting rid
of the pink hair.

01:05:09.296 --> 01:05:12.604
Have you ever seen that colour
in nature?

01:05:12.647 --> 01:05:14.519
I don't think so.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:19.045
I'll take care of you.

01:05:19.089 --> 01:05:22.353
Better than your friends,
better than your family,

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.791
they don't understand you.

01:05:26.835 --> 01:05:28.925
Not like I do.

01:05:28.968 --> 01:05:30.796
Not like we do.

01:05:32.319 --> 01:05:35.932
We're all here
to mend our wounds.

01:05:37.672 --> 01:05:42.373
You were not meant
for the cities.

01:05:42.416 --> 01:05:43.635
You were not meant
for the suburbs.

01:05:43.678 --> 01:05:46.899
You are a beast.

01:05:48.553 --> 01:05:51.208
You've tasted blood
and you crave it even now.

01:05:53.514 --> 01:05:56.343
Your friends could never
understand that.

01:05:56.387 --> 01:05:58.563
Your family--
they tried to hide you from it.

01:05:58.606 --> 01:06:01.479
Steal you away
from your own nature,

01:06:01.522 --> 01:06:04.264
protect you
from who you truly are.

01:06:05.787 --> 01:06:08.660
Not anymore.

01:06:08.703 --> 01:06:12.838
Because we are home
and together again...

01:06:14.274 --> 01:06:16.015
and no one will stop us now.

01:06:17.495 --> 01:06:19.932
Because we are free.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.195
We are wild.

01:06:22.239 --> 01:06:24.154
We are... one...

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:30.421
Let's give freedom a try then.

01:06:30.464 --> 01:06:31.378
Shall we?

01:06:33.337 --> 01:06:35.556
Baby steps, of course.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.905
The best thing, I think...

01:06:38.646 --> 01:06:40.344
Go back a few years...

01:06:43.869 --> 01:06:47.786
Like the last few years
of life away.

01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:52.356
Finally return to where
we were together last.

01:06:53.748 --> 01:06:55.315
No crusts, right?

01:07:23.256 --> 01:07:25.432
I remember
when I first saw you,

01:07:27.347 --> 01:07:28.305
I couldn't believe it.

01:07:28.348 --> 01:07:31.438
This young girl...

01:07:33.701 --> 01:07:35.921
It came so naturally to you.

01:07:35.964 --> 01:07:37.879
So instinctively.

01:07:39.751 --> 01:07:41.666
You didn't hesitate.

01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:47.454
I need you to acknowledge
what happened.

01:07:50.501 --> 01:07:52.198
I need you to admit
that you remember...

01:07:52.242 --> 01:07:54.070
what you did that day.

01:08:06.778 --> 01:08:07.909
Well...

01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:11.696
No use crying
over spilled milk.

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.791
We can fix this.

01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:30.453
The Native Americans
used to brew a special tea

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:35.415
to help them connect
with their spiritual ancestors.

01:08:36.850 --> 01:08:40.594
It was a means to yoke
their true selves together.

01:08:40.638 --> 01:08:42.379
To see inside.

01:08:44.381 --> 01:08:46.209
To return to their core.

01:08:55.783 --> 01:08:59.569
Let's see how much
of your special tea

01:08:59.613 --> 01:09:02.180
it takes for you to remember
who you really are.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.883
Wait, let me do it.

01:09:08.926 --> 01:09:11.973
- Let you?
- Please, please.

01:09:13.323 --> 01:09:16.890
After everything,
I deserve this.

01:09:16.935 --> 01:09:18.763
You wanna to punish yourself?

01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:27.859
Yes, here you go.

01:09:32.645 --> 01:09:34.779
Just a little fix.

01:09:34.822 --> 01:09:36.563
Just gotta give myself
another fix.

01:09:45.006 --> 01:09:47.225
I should have never let you go.

01:09:58.585 --> 01:10:00.413
You fucking psycho.

01:10:09.509 --> 01:10:12.033
Looks like there's still bullets
in this one, fucker.

01:10:12.077 --> 01:10:13.513
You running?

01:10:13.557 --> 01:10:15.080
You running?

01:10:53.597 --> 01:10:55.425
It's been a long winter.

01:10:57.688 --> 01:10:59.516
The wolves are hungry.

01:11:31.243 --> 01:11:34.159
Do you know where
your other friends are?

01:11:34.202 --> 01:11:37.075
There's part of one over there,
just southwest.

01:11:37.118 --> 01:11:39.207
And then there's another...

01:11:39.251 --> 01:11:42.167
a little further
down the mountain.

01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:44.517
It's your fault they're dead.

01:11:44.561 --> 01:11:46.824
You shouldn't have
brought them here.

01:11:46.867 --> 01:11:49.348
This isn't a place
for you kids to party!

01:11:57.661 --> 01:11:59.880
Why did you come back, Chelsea?

01:11:59.924 --> 01:12:03.841
Were you planning on killing me
like you did Uncle Pete?

01:12:03.884 --> 01:12:06.017
Target practice.

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.193
He was teaching you
how to shoot...

01:12:08.236 --> 01:12:09.977
and you turned the gun on him.

01:12:11.065 --> 01:12:13.067
Your own uncle.

01:12:13.111 --> 01:12:14.982
Your own flesh and blood.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.207
I kept your secret.

01:12:23.556 --> 01:12:25.384
I protected you.

01:12:27.125 --> 01:12:29.997
You show me
some fucking gratitude.

01:13:23.747 --> 01:13:25.488
I saw something in you.

01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:29.317
Something no one else saw.

01:13:35.976 --> 01:13:38.849
We're the same.

01:13:38.892 --> 01:13:39.850
Say it.

01:13:41.765 --> 01:13:43.419
Say it.

01:13:43.462 --> 01:13:44.420
We're the same.

01:13:46.683 --> 01:13:47.640
Say it.

01:13:51.514 --> 01:13:52.863
Yeah, that's right.

01:13:54.952 --> 01:13:56.214
We're the same.

01:14:40.214 --> 01:14:44.436
Take nothing but pictures,
leave nothing but footprints.

01:14:54.185 --> 01:14:56.056
Kill nothing but time.
