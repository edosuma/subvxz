00:54.598 --> 00:57.268
Mmm. Good morning, Moon Pie.

01:09.928 --> 01:12.518
[harpsicord music
playing]

01:12.518 --> 01:17.428
- Let us revel!

01:17.428 --> 01:19.848
Look out below!

01:19.848 --> 01:21.638
-Whoo-hoo!

01:21.638 --> 01:22.888
Ha ha ha!

01:26.728 --> 01:28.638
Hoo ha ha ha!

01:32.348 --> 01:34.268
Ha ha!

01:35.268 --> 01:36.728
Forward!

01:38.688 --> 01:40.928
Aha!

01:54.478 --> 01:56.478
-Get away.

01:58.388 --> 02:01.388
-Keep it going!

02:01.388 --> 02:02.768
Ha ha ha ha!

02:02.768 --> 02:04.188
Whoa-ho!

02:05.978 --> 02:08.348
Hot Tub's outta water!

02:13.688 --> 02:15.228
I need this!

02:16.058 --> 02:17.928
Ha ha! Yaah!

02:28.808 --> 02:31.098
Aha!

02:34.518 --> 02:36.268
Oh, no.

02:36.268 --> 02:38.888
Well, you're free now,
little monkey.

02:46.518 --> 02:50.098
Hey! Can someone
come and fix my thing?

02:53.138 --> 02:56.188
Looks like I've got to go
wake somebody up.

02:56.188 --> 02:57.268
FoolDuke!

02:57.268 --> 02:59.478
-Wake up!

02:59.478 --> 03:01.558
Ah, FoolDuke, ha!

03:01.558 --> 03:04.058
My music thing
isn't working.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.638
I need you
to take a look at it.

03:05.638 --> 03:07.478
Where's my monkey?

03:07.478 --> 03:09.518
Oh. Oh, that
was your monkey?

03:09.518 --> 03:11.478
Can't say that I've seen him.

03:11.478 --> 03:14.728
Not to be rude,
but there are more pressing
matters, you see.

03:14.728 --> 03:15.728
-Uh.

03:15.728 --> 03:19.018
Uh, Star?

03:19.018 --> 03:21.428
Wow, this place is a mess.

03:21.428 --> 03:22.728
Marco!

03:22.728 --> 03:24.348
Oh, hey, River.

03:24.348 --> 03:25.688
Marco, my boy!

03:25.688 --> 03:28.228
I can't believe you're here!

03:28.228 --> 03:30.518
Have you seen
FoolDuke's monkey?

03:30.518 --> 03:32.928
Uh... no.

03:32.928 --> 03:35.728
Well, we better keep
an eye out.

03:37.098 --> 03:38.808
Well, what's this?

03:38.808 --> 03:44.348
Oh, well, they were
Captain Blanche's Sugar Seeds.

03:44.348 --> 03:46.598
It's, uh,
Star's favorite cereal.

03:46.598 --> 03:50.348
You can't get them on Mewni,
so I brought her a box.

03:50.348 --> 03:52.138
Marco, you're not giving
that to my daughter.

03:52.138 --> 03:53.518
It's all smashed.

03:53.518 --> 03:55.268
Probably a good thing
she's not here.

03:56.888 --> 04:00.888
Now there must be some other way
to summon forth the music.

04:00.888 --> 04:02.518
We will rock at you.

04:02.518 --> 04:06.768
Look, River, I gotta say
I'm pretty worried about Star.

04:06.768 --> 04:08.688
She left Earth
in kind of a hurry.

04:08.688 --> 04:10.728
She's not in trouble
or anything, right?

04:10.728 --> 04:13.638
No, not at all!

04:13.638 --> 04:16.558
She and her mother
just took a little trip,

04:16.558 --> 04:19.098
and Moon Pie
asked me to keep up
morale in the kingdom

04:19.098 --> 04:20.558
until they get back.

04:20.558 --> 04:24.888
So we've been rippin' it
nonstop for days!

04:24.888 --> 04:26.428
I-- I don't know, man.

04:26.428 --> 04:28.848
Have you looked outside?

04:28.848 --> 04:32.138
What do you mean,
"Have I looked outside?"

04:32.138 --> 04:35.598
What I mean is, morale
doesn't look so high to me.

04:38.098 --> 04:41.558
What are you
talking about, Marco?

04:41.558 --> 04:44.638
The people are happy
if their king is happy.

04:44.638 --> 04:45.768
Let me show you.

04:45.768 --> 04:48.598
Greetings,
my gleeful subjects!

04:49.598 --> 04:50.598
Huh?

04:50.598 --> 04:53.098
Ah! Funny story!

04:53.098 --> 04:57.188
My know-it-all friend,
Marco Diaz here,

04:57.188 --> 04:59.638
seems to think you're
not having a good time.

04:59.638 --> 05:02.518
And I said,
"That's impossible."

05:02.518 --> 05:04.518
Of course
you're having a good time

05:04.518 --> 05:07.308
with all these good times
I'm having.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.478
So tell me,

05:08.478 --> 05:12.308
are you not lifted?!

05:13.348 --> 05:14.728
Whoo!

05:14.728 --> 05:15.728
How's about you lift

05:15.728 --> 05:17.518
some of this garbage
out of the streets?

05:18.638 --> 05:21.638
Huh?
Is that what that stuff is?

05:21.638 --> 05:24.688
I thought you
were all having a garage sale.

05:24.688 --> 05:28.058
What are
you gonna do about
the burning building?!

05:28.058 --> 05:31.098
Ah, you have to let one burn
every once in a while.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.728
How else will you
have room for a new one?

05:33.728 --> 05:37.268
Well,
what about the monster
in the cornfield?

05:37.268 --> 05:39.808
-There's no monster
in the corn--

05:41.518 --> 05:42.888
Huh.

05:42.888 --> 05:44.558
Well, I'll be dipped.

05:44.558 --> 05:46.348
Well, I should be able
to take care of that.

05:47.638 --> 05:48.728
Hey, you there!

05:48.728 --> 05:50.558
Move along!

05:50.558 --> 05:52.018
Scram! Get out!

05:53.638 --> 05:55.188
We don't want you here!

06:00.638 --> 06:02.138
Don't worry!

06:02.138 --> 06:04.478
She'll never make it past
the magic shield.

06:06.558 --> 06:09.728
-The beast cometh!

06:09.728 --> 06:11.348
There's still the moat!

06:11.348 --> 06:13.558
Yes. She'll never make it
across the magic moat!

06:15.978 --> 06:18.268
The magic traffic cones?

06:19.768 --> 06:22.098
We're about to die, y'all!

06:22.098 --> 06:24.348
-Run!

06:25.978 --> 06:29.768
Hey! Thanks for partyin' us
all to our deaths!

06:29.768 --> 06:32.348
He's right.
I'm not fit to rule.

06:37.098 --> 06:38.728
Uh, wait a minute.

06:39.518 --> 06:40.518
Hey!

06:44.518 --> 06:45.768
You locked me out!

06:45.768 --> 06:49.728
Oh, no. Now I lock you
on the balcony.

06:49.728 --> 06:50.558
It's okay.

06:50.558 --> 06:52.888
Just unlock the door.

06:52.888 --> 06:54.808
I can't do anything right!

06:54.808 --> 06:57.688
I can't
do anything right!

07:02.308 --> 07:04.978
Hey! Pull yourself
together, man!

07:04.978 --> 07:07.308
Moon should never
have left me in charge.

07:07.308 --> 07:09.098
"The people love you,"
she said.

07:09.098 --> 07:11.688
"Keep them happy
and safe," she said.

07:11.688 --> 07:14.768
And now, because of me,
the kingdom is defenseless!

07:17.308 --> 07:20.728
Moon didn't even tell me
where she was taking Star.

07:20.728 --> 07:22.138
What if something
happened to them?

07:22.138 --> 07:24.188
No wonder I want
to party all the time.

07:24.188 --> 07:25.518
I'm worried sick!

07:25.518 --> 07:27.138
I'm worried, too.

07:27.138 --> 07:29.138
Star just... left.

07:29.138 --> 07:31.518
Do you have any idea
when she'll be back?

07:31.518 --> 07:33.688
It's funny
you should ask, Marco.

07:33.688 --> 07:35.138
Let me show you something.

07:35.138 --> 07:36.518
Whenever Moon goes away,

07:36.518 --> 07:39.138
she always puts together
a few outfits for me,

07:39.138 --> 07:41.268
so I know what to wear
while she's gone.

07:41.268 --> 07:42.888
But-- But look at this!

07:42.888 --> 07:45.388
She's got them
piled up

07:45.388 --> 07:47.558
all the way
to the top of the room.

07:47.558 --> 07:50.308
So it's probably

07:50.308 --> 07:53.928
she's not coming back
anytime soon, is she, Marco?

07:56.688 --> 07:58.188
I don't know.

07:58.188 --> 07:59.728
But they
can't ever come home

07:59.728 --> 08:03.188
if they don't have
a home to come home to.

08:05.098 --> 08:06.978
Oh, right, yes,
I see what you're saying.

08:06.978 --> 08:08.558
This is the end
of everything.

08:09.768 --> 08:11.388
No!

08:11.388 --> 08:12.928
It means you have
to go lead your people.

08:12.928 --> 08:14.388
But they hate me!

08:14.388 --> 08:17.058
They've
never hated me before.

08:17.058 --> 08:18.308
It doesn't matter.

08:18.308 --> 08:19.848
You're the only king
they have.

08:19.848 --> 08:23.768
You sound just like my wife.

08:23.768 --> 08:26.348
And that's just what I need!

08:26.348 --> 08:29.058
My people! Please, listen!

08:31.478 --> 08:32.518
We all-- Ow!

08:32.518 --> 08:33.928
Okay, I deserved that.

08:33.928 --> 08:35.978
Look, if the Queen were here,

08:35.978 --> 08:38.558
she'd fix all this
with her magic!

08:38.558 --> 08:40.058
Well, she's not here!

08:40.058 --> 08:42.808
But that doesn't mean
we should cower in fear.

08:42.808 --> 08:44.388
We still have each other,

08:44.388 --> 08:47.978
and together,
we can defeat this monster!

08:47.978 --> 08:51.138
No offense, King,
but you're a terrible king!

08:51.138 --> 08:53.018
You're right.

08:53.018 --> 08:54.598
I stink at this.

08:54.598 --> 08:56.598
But right now,
I'm all you've got,

08:56.598 --> 08:58.728
and you're all I've got.

08:58.728 --> 09:01.348
-We can't do anything!

09:01.348 --> 09:04.348
We don't have
any weapons or magic!

09:04.348 --> 09:07.728
We don't need magic
to do extraordinary things.

09:07.728 --> 09:09.928
Dentist! Construction worker!

09:09.928 --> 09:11.688
Remember when you two
worked together

09:11.688 --> 09:15.228
to dislodge that tooth-shaped
rock in the road?

09:15.228 --> 09:18.188
Blacksmith! You worked
with the turtle sanctuary

09:18.188 --> 09:20.808
to make iron shells
for the turtles in need!

09:22.478 --> 09:23.768
And you two weirdos

09:23.768 --> 09:26.348
hold the record
for the longest staring contest!

09:26.348 --> 09:27.348
Wha

09:27.348 --> 09:28.348
Whoo-hoo!

09:28.348 --> 09:30.138
Aw, man, I lost!

09:30.138 --> 09:32.768
We all can do something
unique and helpful,

09:32.768 --> 09:35.388
and that's Mewni's
greatest strength!

09:35.388 --> 09:38.728
And it's what Queen Moon
loves the most about all of you!

09:38.728 --> 09:41.928
-Yeah, we are pretty good!

09:41.928 --> 09:45.348
Uh, I don't think
any of that's gonna
help us defeat the monster.

09:46.928 --> 09:48.728
So what do you say?

09:48.728 --> 09:50.638
Let's show that monster
what happens

09:50.638 --> 09:53.058
when it messes with Mewmans!

09:55.308 --> 09:56.688
Huh!

09:56.688 --> 09:59.228
FoolDuke, fetch us
our loincloths!

09:59.228 --> 10:00.558
What?

10:00.558 --> 10:02.638
-Ha ha!

10:03.888 --> 10:06.478
He's near!

10:06.478 --> 10:08.138
Yeah, he's right there.

10:08.138 --> 10:11.348
Hey, monster!

10:12.688 --> 10:14.928
Go away!

10:18.638 --> 10:20.688
Go away?

10:20.688 --> 10:23.478
But you're the one
who called me over.

10:23.478 --> 10:26.138
What?
I didn't call you over.

10:26.138 --> 10:27.598
Yes, you did.

10:27.598 --> 10:31.888
You kept motioning,
"Come here, come here."

10:31.888 --> 10:36.598
Oh, no. I was motioning,
"Go away, go away!"

10:36.598 --> 10:40.768
Oh, no. That's,
"Come here, come here."

10:40.768 --> 10:43.978
No, it's,
"Go away, go away!"

10:43.978 --> 10:45.688
Ohh!

10:45.688 --> 10:49.688
So you're telling me
I came all this way
for nothing?

10:49.688 --> 10:52.138
I got, like, a thousand
splinters on this foot.

10:52.138 --> 10:53.728
Help!

10:53.728 --> 10:55.768
You might consider widening
the streets a little.

10:55.768 --> 10:58.478
What a waste of my day.

11:02.018 --> 11:04.688
We did it!

11:04.688 --> 11:10.308
Everyone, I'm holding
one final off-the-chain
party at the castle

11:10.308 --> 11:13.478
in honor of all of you!

11:13.478 --> 11:15.638
Three cheers
for King River!

11:15.638 --> 11:17.638
Hip hip, hooray!

11:17.638 --> 11:19.888
-Hip hip, hooray!
Hooray!

11:19.888 --> 11:22.428
-Hip Hip--
-Hooray!

11:23.688 --> 11:25.518
Hip hip, hooray!
